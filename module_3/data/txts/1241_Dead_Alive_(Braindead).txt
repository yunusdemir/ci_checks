I've got the vibes.
This thing is evil, man.
I got a bad feeling.
Shut up and keep moving.
Is big mistake.
Let it go, man. We set it
down, and we let it go.
It's only a bloody monkey,
for Christ's sake. Now pick it up.
Listen, you no pick up the cage,
you no get the big dollars.
Holy shit!
Don't move!
What are these buggers playing at?
He says the Rat Monkey
must be set free.
He says we must leave this
valley and never return,
or the evil spirits will
exact their revenge.
Permit. Look and see. Permit.
Permit!
I'm a New Zealand zoo official, and
this monkey is going to Newtown.
Move it!
Start her up! Quick!
Hey!
Drive, you buggers!
Man, wait.
Step on it!
Ow!
The little bugger bit me.
<i>Zingaya! Zingaya!</i>
You've got the bite.
There's some Dettol in the jeep.
Jeez! No!
No! What are you doing?
<i>Zingaya.</i>
Shit!
<i>- Zingaya!
- Zingaya!</i>
Thank you.
- Hi, Paquita.
- Good morning, Roger.
That's the lot.
Tell your dad I'll be round on
Thursday with the saveloys.
That's a pretty dress, Paquita.
See you later, alligator.
You like that boy, Paquita?
Shuffle the cards.
We will see if you and Roger
are destined to be together.
Create his image in your
mind and cut the cards.
Paquita,
I thought we'd seen
the last of this.
And here you go,
you start over again.
This is you.
And this is the man of your future.
- But he doesn't look like Roger.
- It is not Roger.
There will be one romance,
and it shall last forever.
Romance?
What about money?
This man will enter your
life in the near future.
And you will become romantically
entangled with him.
- Almost immediately.
- But who is it?
You will recognize this man
by the symbol of the star
and of the moon.
- What is this?
- No, not that one.
Paquita, we have a customer.
- It's bad, yes?
- Nothing.
Paquita!
Just dropping off our order.
Um...
Mum says to pack the biscuits on top
because she doesn't want any broken.
Uh... Actually,
I'll take one of these now.
Sorry.
<i>Santa Maria.</i>
I better be off then.
Lionel!
Lionel!
<i>Good morning, everybody.</i>
<i>Morning, everybody.
Well, now I'd like...</i>
There's a beetle.
Eh?
There. Under the fridge.
Horrid little creature
scuttled right in front of me.
I thought I told you
to spray this house!
The place is infested with vermin.
I'll get on it straight away, Mum.
Lionel!
You'll be pleased to know
that your mother has been voted
treasurer elect of the WLWL.
The Wellington Ladies'
Welfare League.
That's great, Mum.
And on Friday,
the president, Nora Matheson, is dropping
by to offer her congratulations.
Wow, the president.
Oh, God!
Look at the state of this place!
All the windows will
have to be polished.
Look at this dust!
It's an inch thick!
- You'll have to do the silver.
- I polished it last week.
And the drapes need cleaning.
- Oh!
- I just mowed the lawn.
Does this look like a
well-maintained frontage?
Get off, you stupid dog.
Here, I'll help you.
No. I manage.
Your brother usually
does the deliveries.
Not today.
Oh... Is big house.
You live here always?
Yeah.
You like my dog?
Is very big, yes?
Any bigger, and he'd
belong in a zoo.
Zoo? Pardon?
Zoo. You know, animals? Cages?
Ah. <i>Claro.</i>
I like to go with zoo.
I go with the zoo?
No. No, no.
You want to go to the zoo.
Yes, please.
Oh.
Okay.
Tomorrow?
I'll meet you outside the shop.
Okay.
I have to go.
My jardini√®re, it's shattered.
Mum, that was your favorite.
It would never have happened if you'd
taken more care with the dusting.
- I can get you another one.
- It's irreplaceable.
A present from your father.
Our last wedding anniversary.
Before he was taken from us.
I miss him, too.
Oh. Look.
Cary Grant. He is such a dream.
I wish I could be Grace Kelly.
She is so pretty.
Such beautiful blonde hair.
<i>Lionel?</i>
What is wrong?
Sorry.
Um...
When I was young, I was
at the beach, and I...
I nearly drowned when
I fell off this pier.
My dad dived in to save me,
but as he was climbing out,
this freak wave just
washed him out to sea
and he drowned.
Oh! The little monkeys!
Look, Lionel.
- Oh!
- Oh!
There! For you!
Poor little bugger.
Get out of there,
you vicious little shit!
Reckon they're only found
on one island, you know?
Story goes, these great big rats
come scuttling off the slave ships
and raped all the
little tree monkeys.
You know, the natives use
them in black magic rituals.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Don't ask me how.
Probably suck the
blood of virgins, eh?
I want to sit down.
Wow.
Hmm.
Oh!
Mum?
Mum!
Holy shit!
Look at this. It bit me.
I've been savaged.
And my dress.
Here, I help you.
Lionel.
Take me home.
There you are, Vera.
Now, you just rest up.
I'll be back in a couple of
days to change that dressing.
Thanks, Nurse McTavish.
It's all right, Lionel.
I'll see myself out.
Why have you deliberately gone
out of your way to upset me?
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
I don't deserve all this
attention, darling.
If you need anything
during the night,
- you just call.
- You're so good to me.
Good night, Mum.
Lionel!
Hello!
Shh!
Keep your voice down.
- Look, I have your jacket.
- Yeah. I'll get it tomorrow.
What?
Look.
- It could've waited till the morning.
- Is that all you have to say?
Look, I'm really sorry
about the zoo, Paquita.
It's just Mum, she's...
You know.
We go out again? To a movie?
Look.
I'd like to.
But it's not...
It's just not possible.
Not possible?
But we are romantically entangled.
Entangled? Look...
Look, I don't know
what you're thinking,
but I just can't see you anymore.
Paquita.
There will be one romance,
and it shall last forever.
Wow! Mum, what a beautiful day.
Oh!
I'm gonna call Nurse McTavish.
No. You'll do no such thing.
- I'm perfectly all right.
- But...
You'll look after me, Lionel.
Nora Matheson. Ladies'
Welfare League.
Your mother's expecting us.
The Mathesons are here.
No, Mum. You're not well!
Get my dress!
Oh.
Jeez!
Please go back to bed, Mum.
I'll put them off. It's
only the Mathesons.
It's the WLWL!
Careful. It'll stick on crooked.
Our main objective next year
is to try to get some of
the younger generation
involved in the league.
That's why I'm so pleased that
you're on the committee, Vera.
Thank you, Nora.
It's a great honor.
Have you had any thoughts on the
agenda for the annual meeting?
Annual meeting.
Annual meeting.
What we need's another war!
Yes, dear.
I hear Sir Edmund Hillary's planning
an attempt on the South Pole.
By trek, though.
Have some more beans,
Mrs. Matheson.
I'll have a few of those, lad.
I really think we
should be going, dear.
Thank you, Lionel.
What?
No pudding?
Only custard, I'm afraid.
Custard.
I haven't had a good
custard in years.
She never makes the stuff.
Damn fine custard.
Rich and creamy,
just the way I like it.
Touchy on the old food front.
Never mind.
That was a fine meal, boy.
Thank you, Mr. Matheson.
- Lionel!
- What's wrong?
Lionel, you must listen to me.
Dark forces are
amassing against you.
My grandmamma has seen it.
"The path ahead is one of
fear and great danger."
Fernando!
Paquita, wait!
God! Mum!
Oh, Fernando.
Your mother ate my dog!
Not all of it.
Get Nurse McTavish, quick.
How long has your
mother been like this?
Since this morning.
Oh... Um...
I'll call an ambulance. You pack
some things for the hospital.
I'll do it.
Nurse McTavish.
Your mother's dead, Lionel.
I'm sorry, Lionel.
There was nothing we could do.
She loved you very much.
Which toothbrush?
Lionel!
Your mother's toothbrush,
the white one or green one?
Green!
<i>Mother, you are looking well today.</i>
<i>I woke up this morning, Phillip,
and I feel 100% better.</i>
<i>How about a nice cup of tea?</i>
<i>I'll just put the jug on.</i>
<i>Sony, Mother. That was
your favorite teapot.</i>
<i>It slipped out of me hand.</i>
<i>Never mind, Phillip.</i>
Bed jacket, nightgown,
slippers and toothbrush.
Where's your mother?
- She's gone to hospital.
- Oh.
I didn't hear the ambulance.
No, no, no.
Um...
Well, uh,
she went in Nurse
McTavish's car, yeah.
Sort of...
Well, sort of... Sort of lying
across the back seat, really.
Yeah. Her and Nurse
McTavish off to hospital.
But her night bag?
I'll take that.
<i>So, it's you who's been
poaching my rabbits.</i>
- Lionel.
<i>- I've a good mind to let you have it</i>
<i>with both barrels.</i>
<i>It weren't me, sir.</i>
<i>It were that Johnny
Morris what did it.</i>
Well, I go now.
<i>You just be on your way, young lad.</i>
<i>If I see you here again,
I'll give you what for.</i>
What do you want?
You're not from the Immigration?
I told you people I lost
my bloody papers, okay?
My family left Latvia
during the occupation.
We were hunted like dogs!
I just want to buy some
sedatives.
What do you think I am?
A goddamn doctor?
I don't sell sedatives.
Tranquilizers, I do have.
Do you want a syringe,
or are you going to sniff?
Lionel, I am happy to see you.
Tell me about these
dark forces.
Death surrounds him.
There will be torment
and suffering.
You are marked.
Lionel.
Lionel, if something
is wrong, I can...
Nothing's wrong, okay?
It contains the power
of the white light.
It will protect you.
Keep it with you always.
How is your mother?
Fine.
Yeah, they want to keep her in
hospital for a few more days.
I didn't see her. She ran
right in front of me.
They must have
discharged her early.
It was a dreadful shock,
losing Vera like that.
Had lunch with her only
last Friday. Picture of health.
- That boy of hers, where is he?
- Fine lad.
Lionel called half a dozen
times in the last two days,
very keen to view the remains.
Of course I had to put him off.
It would have been far too distressing.
As it is, it's been a damn
difficult embalming job.
Oh, my God. Excuse me.
I can tell you're not a Cosgrove.
- You're far too good looking.
- Pardon?
Les is the name. I'm Lionel's...
Lionel's uncle.
And who might you be?
Paquita Maria Sanchez.
Latin, eh?
Excuse me, Father.
- I am looking for Lionel.
- I haven't seen him.
And if he's not here in 10 minutes,
his mother will be delivered into the
hands of the Lord in his absence.
You idiot.
I told you to stay in there.
The embalming machine should've
been turned off half an hour ago.
Great! The old blowout!
You're a half-wit.
This is coming off your wages.
- I'll fix them up.
- No, leave it.
We've got to get the
body to the service.
The theme of today's service
is the sanctity of motherhood.
<i>Vera Cosgrove will be surely missed
by her friends and grieving family,</i>
for she was indeed a fine woman,
<i>and everything a boy could
wish for in a mother.</i>
<i>Lionel,</i>
though deprived of his
father at an early age,
was blessed with an
abundance of mother love.
<i>Though our dear ones depart,</i>
they live on in our
hearts and memories.
Until, in the fullness of time,
we, too, depart from this world.
<i>Until we are reunited once again.</i>
A Christian spirit is eternal.
<i>Yea, whosoever believeth
in the Lord, Jesus Christ,</i>
shall be
resurrected.
Poor Lionel.
He was always dreadfully
attached to his mother.
Well, I've seen some
displays of grief in my day,
but nothing quite like that.
Do you need anything?
I'm fine.
I called to see you yesterday,
but you didn't answer the door.
I just want to be left
alone for a while, okay?
At least he's well provided for.
Yes, well, the Cosgroves
were hardly paupers.
He'll be the sole beneficiary.
Hey. guys.
Look what I found.
What are you doing with this thing?
Digging up a few stiffs?
- I...
- Shut up!
You know what you are?
A bloody sicko.
Yeah, mental.
Get his wallet.
That's my mother you're pissing on.
It's a zombie!
Mom! No!
What in God's name
is going on here?
The devil is amongst us.
Stay back, boy.
This calls for divine intervention.
I kick ass for the Lord!
No!
There you are, Mum.
Void.
Use the spoon.
Hey, hey.
Cut that out.
Shh!
How's it going, Lionel?
Come on, mate.
I'm dying for a slash.
I've got a urinary infection.
Christ, what a stink!
Yeah. Dog must have crawled
under the house and died.
Can't have been easy for you
these past few weeks, Lionel,
what with your mother gone.
Oh!
Who's that little girl
you've been seeing?
What?
You know, the little Latin
number with a cute bum.
Paquita.
Yeah. Paquita.
That's the one.
She's a bit of all right.
Wouldn't mind her doing
the growl on me.
So, all this is coming your way?
Of course,
your mother was always intending
to leave me a bequest.
- Oh?
- Yes. We talked about it many times.
It was a foregone
conclusion, really.
It's just, with her dying suddenly,
she didn't get the chance
to include me in her will.
Well, you'll have to talk to the
lawyers about that, Uncle Les.
Don't bring the bloody
lawyers into it.
This is a private family matter.
What the hell's that?
It's the pipes.
They do that sometimes.
It's not the pipes, Lionel.
It's somebody doing the business.
Please, Uncle Les,
you just got to leave.
So you found your dad's
old stag movies?
Is that the one with the
donkey and the chambermaid?
No, please.
All right. I understand, Lionel.
Some things a man prefers
to do on his own.
It's all part of the
grieving process.
I'll be seeing you, Lionel.
<i>Nijinsky was of what nationality?</i>
<i>Nijinsky was Russian.</i>
<i>Russian is right. That's very...</i>
Lionel!
I dropped a shilling. It must
have rolled down the drain.
I come to see you, you
shut the door in my face.
You built a big wall. I telephone,
and you don't answer.
Why?
Speak to me.
You don't want to see me anymore?
It was a mistake.
Sorry.
Goodbye.
- Paquita.
- Leave me alone.
- I'm sorry.
- Leave me alone.
Take your hands off her, you creep!
You know what they're saying
about you, don't you?
You've gone funny in the head.
A real bloody weirdo.
You touch her again, and I'll knock
you into the middle of next week.
Come on, Paquita.
Cute little guy.
Hello. Hello.
Who's a cutie?
Who's a cute little Selwyn here?
Oh!
Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo.
So I said...
Yeah!
Hyperactive.
So, I tackled this guy, right?
I brought him down with
this real bone cruncher.
And the ball rolls free, so I scooped
it up, and you know what I did?
I drop kicked from 50 yards out.
God, you should have seen it.
Put us three points ahead,
gave us the match.
Fantastic.
Hello, Lionel.
That's quite a collection of
stiffs you got down there.
And I thought you were
such a quiet chappie.
Uncle Les, they're
not what you think.
Back off, mate!
Lay a hand on me,
I'll have you for breakfast.
I'm sorry, Lionel.
If I don't report this, I'll be
an accessory after the fact.
I hope they can keep it out of the
papers for your mother's sake.
She always hated a scandal.
This is hard for me, Lionel, informing
on me sister's boy and all.
Of course if I was to keep me mouth
shut, I'd be taking a hell of a risk.
Hey, put me through
to the police, please.
Of course if I was to get my
fair share of Vera's estate,
I might be more inclined to
protect a member of the family.
You want the money?
Detective Sergeant Bauer, I'd
like to report a multiple murder.
Yes, I'll wait.
The money and the house.
Blood is thicker
than water, Lionel.
Yeah, good day. Les about?
Barry, you bastard!
Thought we'd pop over and take
a squish at your new digs.
Yeah, mate. Why not?
- Rip the skins off a few brown ones.
- Yeah. We'll make a night of it.
- Where are you going?
- Just for a walk.
No, mate. These people want
a feast. We'll get a party going.
We'll just get some
savories for you, mate.
Have you gotten rid
of those stiffs yet?
Hey, Les, let's stick
some real music on.
Yeah. Coming through.
Better clear the dance floor.
I don't know what sort of
kinky shit you're into,
but I want those things buried.
Come on, baby, let's dance!
It's no good asking Lionel.
He's nothing like his old man.
He was a real stick man.
Used to pull the birds
like you wouldn't believe.
Don't talk about my
father like that.
Tasty.
You got anything else
that I can nibble on?
So, you know, I throw him a
dummy, fooled him completely.
Now, you got to imagine,
this is, like...
This is, like, 10, 15 yards
out from the sideline.
There are several of these big
buggers coming towards me, right?
So what do I do? I... I...
I put my head down,
and I shocked again. I touched
down right between the posts. God.
You know, the coach reckons
I'm a dead certain
for the next All Blacks trials.
What do you think
about that, Paquita?
You could be going out
with the next Bob Scott.
Oh!
What have we here!
A cute little <i>signorina</i>, right?
- Let go of me!
- Come on, now. Don't be a party pooper.
Come and have a drink.
I bet you go off like a rocket.
Oh!
You little bitch! I'll get you!
Where did she go?
You foreign bitch! I'll get you!
Hello?
Hello?
Paquita!
Paquita.
"Death surrounds him."
They're not dead exactly.
They're just
sort of rotting.
Nurse McTavish.
Father McGruder.
Your mother!
I don't know what to do,
you know? I...
I don't know how to stop it.
You must destroy them.
I... I can't.
Not Mum.
That thing is not your mother.
Come on, Les, join in.
I'll do it.
What's this?
Two lovebirds flying
the coop, is it?
- Out of the way, Uncle Les!
- You're not going anywhere, mate,
until the house
papers come through.
Come on, Lionel.
No, you don't!
Oh!
- Ahhh!
- Ahhh!
Come on!
You fiery, little bitch.
It's time you and I got
better acquainted.
Oh!
Help! Someone! Please!
For God's sake, run!
Not so loud, mate!
<i>- Bastardo!</i>
- Bitch!
<i>Madre de Dios!</i>
- Help us!
- Bugger that!
Run, Paquita!
Help!
Help! Help! Help!
Shit!
Help! Help!
Please don't kill me.
It's okay. It's me.
That's a nasty plaque problem
you got there, mate.
Got a bit of a cavity there, mate.
Mandy.
It's me, Rita.
Remember?
Oh!
You mutant little shit!
You'll be okay.
Let me in! For Christ's
sake, let me in!
Let me in! Help!
Please, help!
Paquita, we must.
Come on! Help! Quickly!
There's thousands of them!
What the hell's this?
Leave her alone.
She's been bitten! You
know what that means?
She's gonna turn into one of them!
I won't. I won't.
Help me!
- Stop it!
- You stay out of it!
I know what to do! She's history!
I've read the comics!
Total lobotomy!
- Dismemberment!
- You're crazy!
There's no room for
hysterical women in my unit!
Step right up, you
creepy old bastards!
Lionel.
Paquita!
No!
Just as well someone around
here's got balls, eh, girls?
You goddamn little rug rat!
Get out of the way!
You little maggot!
Where are you, you little crawler?
No!
Lionel!
Holy Christ! Vera!
Leave me.
Party's over.
Rita?
God! No!
No! You just get out of here.
What?
Haven't seen Mum yet.
Come to Mummy, Lionel.
Come on!
No!
You don't scare me, Mum.
All my life, you told
me nothing but lies.
That stuff about Dad,
none of that was true!
You drowned them both, Mum.
Dad and that blonde woman.
You caught them together and
you killed them, didn't you?
How dare you speak to me like that.
Didn't you?
Lionel Here! Quick!
Slut!
Don't you touch her.
No!
No one will ever love
you like your mother.
No!
No!
No!
No! No!
Such a good boy.
No.
No!
No.
