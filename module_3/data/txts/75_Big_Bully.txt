    <i> DEATH ROCK</i> BY DAVID LEARY.
        CHAPTER 1.
    EVERYONE IN TOWN HAD COME
        TO SEE THE ROCK
    TILL THERE WAS ONLY
    ONE OLD MAN LEFT.
    THE OLD MAN LIMPED UP
    TO THE MOON ROCK
    'CAUSE HE HAD A CANE
        OR SOMETHING.
        HE REACHED OUT
    TO TOUCH THE ROCK WHEN...
            FREEZE!
FREEZE!                 FREEZE!
        "DON'T TOUCH
        THAT MOON ROCK."
    BUT THE OLD MAN
    WAS DEAF OR SOMETHING."
                I'M DEAF
                OR SOMETHING.
    AND SO HE REACHED OUT
    WITH HIS WRINKLED HAND
            AND...
    BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!
YOU'D BETTER
BE SLEEPING!
            I AM.
    <i> I KNEW THAT ONE DAY</i>
    <i> I WOULD LEAVE THIS PLACE,</i>
        <i> AND I WOULD</i>
    <i> BECOME A REAL WRITER.</i>
    <i> I MUST HAVE</i>
    <i> HAD HUNDREDS OF TOYS</i>
    <i> THROUGHOUT MY CHILDHOOD,</i>
    <i> BUT ONE WAS SPECIAL</i>
    <i> ABOVE ALL THE OTHERS.</i>
    <i> I'D SAVE MY ALLOWANCE</i>
    <i> FOR THREE MONTHS</i>
    <i> TO BUY THE EVEL KNIEVEL</i>
        <i> ACTION FIGURE.</i>
    <i> IT WAS AN ADDITIONAL</i>
        <i> FOUR MONTHS</i>
        <i> BEFORE I COULD</i>
    <i> AFFORD THE SUPERCYCLE,</i>
    <i> BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.</i>
    <i> EVEL WAS DARING,</i>
    <i> COOL, FEARLESS.</i>
    <i> IN SHORT, HE WAS EVERYTHING</i>
        <i> THAT I WASN'T.</i>
        EVEL KNIEVEL'S A PUSSY.
ONE DAY YOU'LL BE SORRY
YOU EVER DID THAT.
            FUNNY, I
            DON'T FEEL SORRY.

        STILL GOT MY OLD TUBA
        IN THE ATTIC
        IF HE'D LIKE
        TO GIVE IT A WHIRL.
            DAVID?
        COME ON, BEN!
    IT'S THE FIRST DAY.
    I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.
        COME ON, BEN!
        LET'S GO!
                HAVE A NICE DAY!
        THANKS, DAD.
            MORNING, NEIGHBOR!
MORNING, ART.
        I'LL BET
        YOU'RE WONDERING
        WHY IN THE SAM HILL
        AM I CHOPPING WOOD
        WHEN THE WEATHER
        IS SO PLEASANT.
NOT REALLY.
            YOU KNOW
            WHO SAM HILL WAS?
NO, I DON'T.
        WELL, HE WASN'T ANYONE.
        IT'S A EUPHEMISM.
        COCKNEY EXPRESSION
        FOR "WHAT THE HELL?"
        [COCKNEY ACCENT]
        WHAT THE 'ELL?
        WHAT THE 'ELL?
        THEN IT TURNED INTO...
        WHAT THE SAM HILL?
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, ART.
YOU'LL BE HERE LATER,
RIGHT?
                WHAT THE 'ELL?
MS. RUMPERT?
I'M DAVID LEARY.
I WAS A STUDENT
HERE ONCE.
I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO TELL YOU
WHAT A BIG IMPACT
THIS LIBRARY
HAD ON MY LIFE.
IT WAS THE FIRST PLACE
THAT REALLY
TAUGHT ME THE IMPORTANCE
OF READING, OF BOOKS.
ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU THAT.
            <i> GREEN EGGS AND HAM.</i>
EXCUSE ME?
            <i> GREEN EGGS AND HAM.</i>
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE BOOK.
HOW DID YOU
REMEMBER THAT?
        IT'S 8,862 DAYS OVERDUE.
YOU'RE SERIOUS.
            IT'S WHAT
            I LIVE FOR, DEAR.
    I'M MR. LEARY,
        AND THIS IS
    CREATIVE WRITING 202.
            YES?
I HAVE TO URINATE.
    WE JUST GOT STARTED.
        WHY DIDN'T YOU
        GO BEFORE CLASS?
I'M BLADDER SHY.
I CAN'T GO WITH SOME
GUY STANDING NEXT TO ME
LIKE A BARNYARD ANIMAL
AT A FEED TROUGH.
I NEED PRIVACY.
        ALL RIGHT. I UNDERSTAND.
    O.K., I WANT EVERYBODY TO
    TAKE OUT A SHEET OF PAPER.
IS THIS A POP QUIZ?
                I CAN'T DO IT.
                I'M TERRIBLE
                AT POP QUIZZES.
        HEY, RELAX.
    THIS ISN'T A POP QUIZ.
IT'S NOT?
    NO. TELL ME A STORY.
    IT CAN BE A PARAGRAPH.
    IT CAN BE A WHOLE PAGE,
    WHATEVER YOU WANT.
    YOU'RE THE AUTHOR.
        YOU DECIDE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW.
    EVERYBODY KNOWS
    HOW TO TELL A STORY.
NOT ME.
            HAVEN'T YOU
            EVER LIED BEFORE?
    NO.
WELL, MAYBE.
    WELL, SOMETIMES WE LIE
    SO THAT WE DON'T
    GET INTO TROUBLE,
    LIKE, "WHO BROKE THAT LAMP?"
    "I DIDN'T BREAK THE LAMP."
    "OH, YEAH? HOW
    DID IT GET BROKEN?"
        "A METEOR CAME
    FLYING THROUGH THE WINDOW
    AND SMASHED INTO IT."
[LAUGHTER]
    SOMETIMES WE LIE TO
    MAKE SOMEBODY FEEL GOOD.
    "YOU KNOW, AUNT SILVIA,
    YOUR TUNA CASSEROLE
        IS FANTASTIC."
    AND SOMETIMES WE LIE,
        WELL, JUST
    BECAUSE WE'RE BORED.
    SO WE MAKE UP A STORY
    TO ENTERTAIN OUR FRIENDS.
    THAT'S ALL WRITING
        REALLY IS.
SO WRITING IS JUST LYING?
        WELL, KIND OF.
        I PROMISE YOU,
    YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING,
        AND YOU WON'T
        GET IN TROUBLE.
    GO ON. LIE TO ME.
        BASTARDS TELL ME
        THE CLASS IS BORING.
        HELL, I KNOW IT.
        I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM
        TALK ABOUT THE NUCLEUS
        OF A CELL EVERY DAY,
        5 DAYS A WEEK
        FOR 14 YEARS.
    IT'LL GET EASIER,
    REALLY.
    THE FIRST DAY
    IS ALWAYS THE WORST.
                HA HA HA!
WELCOME BACK, DAVID.
        DAVID WROTE A BOOK..
I KNOW.
        NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE.
                THANKS A LOT.
    CONGRATULATIONS
    ON YOUR NEW BOOK.
        IT'S GREAT TO
        ACTUALLY BE IN
        THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE.
        I'D WONDERED WHAT
        TEACHERS DID IN HERE.
        NOW I KNOW--SMOKE.
[COUGHING]
            DAVID?
                VICTORIA?
I HEARD YOU
WERE BACK IN TOWN.
                    WHAT ARE YOU
                    DOING HERE?
    SEX...
    ED--UH...
SEX EDU-EDU-EDUCATION.
                YOU TEACH SEX.
    MM-HMM.
                    GREAT.
I READ YOUR BOOK.
            OH, YOU'RE THE ONE.
AND AS HE PLACED
HIS HAND ON THE DOOR,
HE WHISPERED
IN A VOICE SO SOFT
ONLY HIS GHOST COULD HEAR,
"I'M STILL ALIVE."
WELL, I BETTER GO.
I'M GOING TO
BE LATE FOR CLASS.
PROMISE WE'LL
CATCH UP LATER?
                YEAH. YOU
                CAN COUNT ON IT.
        THEN I WILL.
        BYE.
                WHOA.
            I NEED A CIGARETTE.
                    NO. IT WAS--
                    I'M KIDDING.
    UGH!                HEY!
SORRY. OH.
                FIGHT! COME ON.
                FIGHT! FIGHT!
            YES MEANS NO,
            AND NO MEANS YES.
            YOU WANT ME
            TO HIT YOU?
    NO.
                        O.K.
    OW!
            TRY AGAIN.
            WANT ME TO HIT YOU?
    UH...
    YES?
                        O.K.
    OW!
YOU SAID, "YES MEANS NO
AND NO MEANS YES."
            THAT WAS LAST TIME.
    THAT'S ENOUGH, BOYS.
                SORRY I'M LATE.
    WHAT?
                NO. UH, NOTHING.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
                NOTHING, SIR.
    DENNIS!
        DAVID.
WHATEVER. THIS IS HAAS,
OUR SHOP TEACHER.
        IT'S ROSS,
        AND IT'S
        INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION.
WHATEVER.
ROSS IS THE FATHER
OF, UH...
            KIRBY.
WHATEVER.
    HI, KIRBY.
                    HI.
    KIRBY'S THE BOY YOUR SON
    WAS FIGHTING WITH.
VERY SORRY ABOUT THIS.
I ASSURE YOU THIS
WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.
WILL IT, BEN?
                WHO CAN PREDICT
                THE FUTURE?
    I CAN.
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS.
            OH, THAT'S O.K.
            BEN SEEMS LIKE
            A NICE ENOUGH KID.
WELL, HE CAN BE.
LATELY, I FEEL LIKE
GREGORY PECK IN<i> THE OMEN.</i>
                        HUH?
SO YOU TEACH SHOP, HUH?
        YEAH.
        INTRO TO WOODWORKING
        AND ADVANCED METALS.
THAT MUST BE INTERESTING.
        OH, IT IS. ONE TIME WE
        WERE MAKING KEY CHAINS,
        AND I CUT MY THUMB OFF.
        I WRAPPED IT
        IN CELLOPHANE
        AND DROVE
        TO THE HOSPITAL,
        BUT THERE WAS A LINE.
        I WENT TO
        THE HARDWARE STORE
        FOR NEEDLE AND THREAD
        AND STITCHED IT UP
        MYSELF.
YOU SEWED ON
YOUR OWN THUMB?
        I'M GOOD
        AT STUFF LIKE THAT.
        YOU CAN'T MOVE IT MUCH,
        BUT YOU CAN STILL DO
        A FEW THINGS WITH IT.
        BOY, I'M GLAD, TOO,
        'CAUSE THEY SAY
        THE OPPOSABLE THUMB
        IS WHAT SEPARATES MAN
        FROM OTHER ANIMALS.
IT'S GOOD FOR HITCHHIKING.
                        HUH?
YOU KNOW.
                    OH, YEAH.
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'VE GOT A REALLY
NICE SET OF LEGS.
                OH. HO HO! YEAH.
                    YEAH.
        UH, I DIDN'T GET
        YOUR NAME BACK THERE.
        MY NAME'S ROSCO BIGGER,
        BUT YOU CAN CALL ME...
    F-F-F--
                    ROSS.
    David.
                    DAVID...
    DAVID.
                    DAVID.
        [ALARM SOUNDS]
    FIRE...
    DRILL.
HERE YOU GO.
ONE AT A TIME.
            [SIREN]
                COME ON.
                WAIT YOUR TURN.
                GET BACK
                IN LINE.
            YOU KIDS STAY OUT
            OF THE STREET,
            ALL RIGHT?
                    DAVY?
    ULF?
        DAVY, I HEARD
        YOU WERE BACK IN TOWN.
        IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.
        DON'T EXPECT EVERYTHING
        TO BE THE SAME HERE.
        TOWN'S CHANGED A LOT
        SINCE YOU LEFT.
REALLY? HOW?
            WELL, WE
            GOT A NEW WAL-MART.
        HI, DAVID.
        HI, ULF.
HI, VICTORIA.
                HI, VICTORIA.
                        WOW.
SHE JUST
HASN'T BEEN THE SAME
SINCE I DROPPED HER.
                YOU GUYS DATED?
NO. I MEAN I DROPPED HER.
THERE WAS A FIRE
AT HER APARTMENT.
I WAS CARRYING HER
AND DROPPED HER.
                    NEVER MIND.
SHE'S LOOKING AT YOU.
DID YOU SEE HOW SHE
WAS LOOKING AT YOU?
GERRY AND I ARE MEETING
AT ALAN'S BAR TONIGHT.
DROP BY. WE'LL TOSS BACK
A FEW WITH THE BOYS.
        ALAN'S GOT HIS OWN BAR?
RIGHT NEXT
TO THE METHODIST CHURCH.
SEE YOU AT 7:00?
                    SOUNDS GOOD.
HEY, KIDS, WANT TO SEE ME
LIGHT MY ARM ON FIRE?
        YEAH!           YEAH!
                YEAH!
[ULF]
COME ON!
[BELL RINGS]
        ALL RIGHT.
            READY?
MR. LEARY?
                    YEAH, KIRBY?
YOU CAN GO BACK IN NOW.
IT'S SAFE.
SO BE VERY CAREFUL
WHEN TRACING YOUR PATTERN
ONTO THE WOOD.
    O.K., WHO DID THAT?
        IF I FIND OUT
    WHO DID THAT, I'LL--
            YOU'LL WHAT?

    FIRST THINGS FIRST.
    COME ON, ALAN. DO IT.
            OH, HELL, I HAVEN'T
            DONE THAT FOR YEARS.
YOU CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE?
            NO. IT'S GONE.

DO ANY OF YOU GUYS
REMEMBER FANG?
                    ROSS?
                SHOP TEACHER.
    SURE.
REMEMBER WHAT HE WAS
LIKE WHEN WE WERE KIDS,
USED TO BULLY ME AROUND?
            OH, MAN,
            HE NAILED YOU!
            I'VE BEEN DOWN
            THAT ROAD MYSELF.
        EVERYBODY'S
        BEEN PICKED ON.
        IT'S PART
        OF GROWING UP.
YEAH. THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.
BESIDES, WE'VE ALL
GROWN UP SINCE THEN.
            FANG CHANGED AFTER
            THEY SENT HIM AWAY.
            I FORGET
            WHAT HE WAS LIKE.
    THEY SENT HIM AWAY?
REFORM SCHOOL.
                REMEMBER
                THE MOON ROCK?
REMEMBER THE MOON
ROCK WAS STOLEN?
                FANG STOLE IT.
                THEY SENT HIM
                TO REFORM SCHOOL
                FOR THREE YEARS.
WHEN HE CAME BACK,
HE WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON.
        REFORM SCHOOL'S
        ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING,
        "PRISON FOR KIDS."
            AND THE ROCHESTER
            REFORMATORY
            WAS THE WORST
            OF THE BUNCH.
THEY SHUT THAT DOWN.
    [ALAN]
    THEY HAD TO AFTER
    THAT<i> 60 MINUTES</i> STORY.
    WHAT DID THEY CALL IT?
                PEE-WEE PRISON.
    WHEN HE GOT OUT,
    THINGS NORMALIZED, RIGHT?
    HIS PARENTS MUST HAVE--
SKIPPED TOWN.
JUST PICKED UP AND LEFT.
    THEN THEY SENT HIM
    TO AN ORPHANAGE.
    AT LEAST THAT'S
    WHAT WE KNOW.
                NOBODY KNOWS
                WHAT HAPPENED
                AFTER THAT
                'CAUSE HE NEVER
                TALKED ABOUT IT
                TO ANYBODY.
                KIDS ARE CRUEL,
                BUT NOBODY,
                NOBODY DESERVED
                WHAT FANG GOT.

            TO SEE YOU.

                    AAH!
    HEY, HEY!
    WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT
    THROWING WATER BALLOONS
    IN THE HOUSE?
                WHERE YOU BEEN?
I WAS WORKING AT THE SHOP,
MAKING YOU A CABINET.
                    CHECK.
        I DON'T KNOW HOW WE
        GET BY ON YOUR SALARY.
        HAVE YOU ASKED
        ABOUT THAT RAISE?
HONEY, I--
        BARBARA CLARK'S HUSBAND
        HAS ALREADY
        HAD A PROMOTION
        AND TWO RAISES.
        HE'S ONLY BEEN HERE

            QUIT HONEYING ME.
            YOU'RE MAKING

YOUR KID TALKS TO ME?
        HEY, SON, THAT'S NO WAY
        TO SPEAK TO YOUR MOTHER.
SHUT UP!
                    HI, SON.
    HI.
                WHAT YOU DOING?
HOMEWORK
FOR MR. LEARY'S CLASS.
                OH, YEAH?
                WHICH ONE'S HE?
YOU KNOW,

                CAN I SEE IT?
YOU WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

                        HI.
    HIYA.
                WHAT IS THIS?
UH, IT'S HOT DISH.
                WHAT'S HOT DISH?
WELL, A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO
WE HAD LASAGNA,
AND THEN IT TURNS
INTO SPAGHETTI.
WHEN IT'S FINALLY
UNRECOGNIZABLE,
THEY TURN IT INTO...
HOT DISH.
            DID YOU SEE THAT?
    WHAT?
            THAT GUY
            FLICKED A PEA AT ME.
    WHO?
            THE SHOP TEACHER.
                        THERE!
    WHAT?
                HE DID IT AGAIN.
ARE YOU ON MEDICATION
OR SOMETHING?
            THE GUY'S FLICKING
            PEAS AT ME.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
        WOULD I MAKE THIS UP?
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE MAKING ME
VERY NERVOUS.
        SEE IF HE DOES IT AGAIN.
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S EVEN HIM?
IT COULD BE
A CONSPIRACY.
MAYBE THERE'S
A SECOND GUNMAN.
                    VERY FUNNY.
        O.K.,
        SO I'M DAVID LEARY.
        YOU WANT TO HIT ME?
        I'M AN ADULT NOW.
        IF YOU GOT SOMETHING
        TO SAY, SAY IT.
        OTHERWISE
        QUIT FOLLOWING ME.
YOU DROPPED YOUR PEN.
                    THANKS.
        HEY.
WELCOME BACK, DAVY.
BACK IN AN HOUR.
            WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
THE PARK.
            BUT IT'S DARK OUT.
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENS AT NIGHT.
            YOU THINK IT'S SAFE?
DAD, I DON'T THINK
THERE'S TOO MANY
DRIVE-BYS IN MAYBERRY.
YOU STAYING IN?
                YEAH.
YOU O.K.?
        YEAH,
        OF COURSE I'M O.K.
        I DON'T FEEL
        LIKE GOING OUT.
        YOU DON'T ALWAYS FEEL
        LIKE GOING OUT, DO YOU?
    NO.
    I JUST WANT TO STAY IN...
        FOR A WHILE.
I GOTCHA!
                        AH-CHOO!
HI, CLARK.
    AAH!
                        UNH!
                HI, MR. LEARY.
ATOMIC WEDGIE?
                I'M AFRAID SO.
    BEN?
                        UH-HUH.
YOU O.K.?
                    YEAH.
I'LL WALK YOU HOME.
            IS THIS YOUR STREET?
YEAH. IT'S THE BIG ONE
AT THE END. SEE YA.
                    HEY, KIRBY.
    YEAH?
        YOU SHOULDN'T LET BEN
        PICK ON YOU.
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I SHOULD STAND UP
FOR MYSELF,
BE A MAN.
                ARE YOU KIDDING?
    IF YOU STOOD UP TO BEN,
    YOU'D GET CREAMED.
                THAT'S RIGHT!
KNOW WHAT I DID
WITH MY BULLY?
I GAVE HIM AN ALLOWANCE
TO LEAVE ME ALONE.
50 CENTS A WEEK.
            IF THAT DIDN'T WORK,
            I'D THROW HIM OFF
            THE TRAIL.
    HOW?
            NEVER GO RIGHT BACK
            TO YOUR LOCKER
            AFTER CLASS.
            ZIG-ZAG. IF HE
            CAN'T FIND YOU,
            HE CAN'T TOUCH YOU.
    WHAT ELSE?
WELL,
THERE'S ALWAYS B.O.
                    BO--WHAT?
BODY ODOR.
YOU STOP SHOWERING.
YOU LOSE THE DEODORANT.
IF THE SMELL GETS
REALLY, REALLY BAD,
        NO BULLY IN THE WORLD
        WILL COME NEAR YOU.
YOU DIDN'T DATE MUCH
            WHEN YOU WERE A KID,
            DID YOU?
            WANT TO COME IN?
        NO.
SEE YA.

                TO THE PUNCH.
LIKE WHAT?
            HE USED TO SPIT
            INTO MY 2% MILK.
            HE PEED
            IN MY APPLE JUICE.
HE WAS A LITTLE BOY.
                EXACTLY. THAT'S
                WHAT KIDS DO,
                NOT ADULTS.

            IF YOU FIND HER,
            TELL HER
            SHE WAS RIGHT.
            I SCREWED UP,
            BUT I DID
            THE BEST I COULD.
MAYBE IF YOU
TOLD HER YOURSELF,
SHE'D COME BACK.

            AND I ARE DIVORCED.
            WE'RE NEVER GETTING
            BACK TOGETHER.

            NEVER EVER MEANT
            TO BE TOGETHER.
IT WAS A MISTAKE?
                    BEST MISTAKE
                    I EVER MADE.

                YOUR NAME'S
                NOT ON IT.
                OW!
                SISSY FIGHTER!
HA HA! OW!
                        HA!
THIS IS DAVID LEARY.
I NEED TO SEE
PRINCIPAL KOKELAR
RIGHT NOW!
    MISSING SOMETHING, BUDDY?
        I MAY HAVE BEEN
    YOUR FLUNKY BEFORE, FANG...
        BUT NOT ANYMORE.
            HA HA!
    DAD?
                    MR. LEARY?
                    DAD?
MR. BIGGER?
    GOTCHA!
                    HOLY COW!
HOLY SHIT!
    CHICKEN!
                    PORK ROAST!
    YES!
IN YOUR FACE.
        SO YOU SAY
        HE HOUNDS YOU
        FOR NO APPARENT REASON?
        THAT HE CHASES YOU
        DOWN THE STREET
        SCREAMING YOUR NAME?
        THAT ONE OF OUR
        OWN TEACHERS
        IS BEHAVING LIKE
        SOME HIGH-STRUNG
        FOURTH GRADER?
        BUT WHY?
    CRACK.
DAVID LEARY'S
GOT TO BE ON CRACK.
        [KNOCK ON DOOR]
            I'M SORRY
            TO INTERRUPT, SIR,
            BUT I NEED TO TALK
            WITH YOU RIGHT AWAY.
I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT FANG--
ROSCO BIGGER.
                    YES?
I'VE BEEN HAVING
PROBLEMS WITH HIM.
        WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS?
HE'S BEEN PICKING ON ME.
                PICKING ON YOU?
    MM-HMM.
                AND HOW DOES HE
                PICK ON YOU?
    HOW?
                SPECIFICALLY.
IT'S HARD TO SAY
EXACTLY.
                TRY.
            START
            AT THE BEGINNING.
YEAH, AT THE BEGINNING.
WELL, HE SHOT PEAS
AT ME AT LUNCH.
                    PEAS?
    UH-HUH.
                HOW MANY PEAS?
    THREE.
                    I SEE.
        AND YOU'RE CERTAIN
        HE'S THE PEA SHOOTER?
I DON'T HAVE PROOF
EXACTLY, BUT...
    YES.
                        DENNIS.
DAVID.
            WHATEVER.
            MR. BIGGER'S
            BEEN TEACHING HERE
            FOR OVER 13 YEARS.
            IF HE'S HAD
            ANY PROBLEM AT ALL,
            IT'S BEEN THAT
            HE'S TOO PASSIVE.
HE'S CHANGED.
I THINK HE'S CHANGED
BECAUSE OF ME.
        THAT'S ANOTHER STORY,
        ISN'T IT?
    HUH?
            WE INVITED YOU
            BACK TO HASTINGS
            MIDDLE SCHOOL
            TO SET AN EXAMPLE
            FOR THE STUDENTS.
            IF HALF THE STORIES
            I'VE HEARD
            ABOUT YOUR ERRATIC
            BEHAVIOR ARE TRUE,
            I'M AFRAID THIS HAS
            BEEN SOMETHING
            OF A BUST.
            I'M PUTTING YOU
            ON PROBATION.
            IF I DON'T SEE
            MARKED IMPROVEMENT
            ON YOUR PART,
            WE'LL FIND
            A SUBSTITUTE TO
            FINISH THE SEMESTER.
BUT I'M THE TOWN HERO.
    HEY.
                        HI.
WHAT YOU DOING?
                WRITING A POEM.
O.K.
I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.
                        DAD?
    YEP?
                    I'D LIKE YOU
                    TO HEAR IT.
    REALLY?
                YEAH.
                IT'S CALLED
                <i> I ONCE</i>
                <i> HAD A FRIEND.</i>
THAT'S A GOOD NAME
FOR A POEM, SON.
            "I ONCE HAD A FRIEND
            "WHO WAS NEW
            TO MY SCHOOL.
            "I ONCE HAD A FRIEND
            "THAT THE KIDS
            THOUGHT WAS CRUEL.
            "I ONCE HAD A FRIEND
            "WHO STOLE MY
            BAG LUNCH.
            "I ONCE HAD A FRIEND
            "WHO WAS QUICK
            TO THE PUNCH.
            "I ONCE HAD A FRIEND
            "WHO'D LAUGH
            WHEN I'D FALL.
            "I ONCE HAD A FRIEND
            WHO WAS NO FRIEND
            AT ALL."
THAT'S A GOOD
POEM, SON.
THAT'S NOT A VERY GOOD
FRIEND, IS IT?
                NO, IT ISN'T.
                [KNOCK ON DOOR]
HEY, DAVID.
            WE'VE GOT TO TALK,
            ROSS.
    O.K.
        THIS HAS GOT TO STOP.
YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE MONKEY BARS INSTEAD?
        YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
        YOU'VE GOT TO STOP THIS.
        THE PRINCIPAL'S
        GOT ME ON PROBATION.
        MY KID'S DISOWNED ME.
        VICTORIA THINKS
        I'M SOME NUT CASE.
        YOU MAY HAVE GOTTEN
        YOUR LIFE BACK,
        BUT YOU'VE TAKEN
        MINE AWAY.
O.K. MAYBE I GOT
A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.
                    A LITTLE?
A LOT.
IT'S NOT ALL MY FAULT.
            THEN WHOSE IS IT?
YOU BRING IT ON YOURSELF.
            THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
DEEP DOWN INSIDE
YOU'RE STILL JUST
A SCARED LITTLE KID.
            YOU'RE WRONG, ROSS.
AM I?
TELL ME ONE TIME
IN YOUR LIFE
YOU STOOD UP
FOR YOURSELF,
DIDN'T CHICKEN OUT.
                I TURNED YOU IN
                WHEN YOU STOLE
                THE MOON ROCK.
YOU DON'T HAVE THE GUTS
TO DO THAT.
            I DID IT, ROSS.
            AND I ENJOYED IT.
BIG MISTAKE!
        [SNIFFING]
        I SMELL A RAT.
                WELCOME TO HELL!
I'LL BE YOUR TOUR GUIDE.
                YOU EVER BEEN
                TO HELL, DAVY?
                I HAVE!
            EXCEPT THEY DIDN'T
            CALL IT THAT!
            THEY CALLED IT
            THE ROCHESTER
            REFORMATORY.
        YOU EVER HEARD
        OF THAT PLACE?
IT'S WHERE THEY SEND
MURDERERS
WHO ARE TOO YOUNG
TO GO TO PRISON!
I BUNKED WITH A KID
WHO SET HIS MOM ON FIRE
BECAUSE SHE VACUUMED
DURING<i> LOST IN SPACE.</i>
        AND WHEN THOSE
    JUNIOR PSYCHOS ASKED
    WHAT I WAS IN THERE FOR,
        I HAD TO SAY
        I WAS THERE
        BECAUSE I STOLE
        A FREAKING ROCK!
CLEARLY YOU'RE UPSET,
AND I DON'T BLAME YOU.
IT WAS A ROTTEN THING
FOR ME TO DO.
WHY NOT JUST
BEAT ME UP?
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE FIRE,
SCARECROW?
    UGH!
I HOPE THAT HURTS.
            DAMN.
        LOOKS LIKE HE'S
        OUTSMARTED ME AGAIN.
            OH.
        HEY, BUDDY!
        HOW YOU DOING
        UP THERE, HUH?
    IT'S GOOD TO SEE YA!
GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE
FOR YOU UP THERE!
    WHOO!
HERE IT COMES,
BUDDY BOY!
HEE HEE!
IS IT WARM IN HERE
OR IS IT JUST YOU?
                        HA!
YOU LITTLE WEASEL.
        [THUNDER]
        [THUNDER]
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
    HELLO.
                    HEY, KIRBY.
    YEAH?
                IT'S BEN.
            IS YOUR DAD HOME?
NO. IS YOURS?
            UH-UH. YOU THINKING
            WHAT I'M THINKING?
    YEAH.
                    HEY, KIRBY.
    YEAH?
            WANT TO COME OVER?
        I GOT TO STOP.
        I'LL BE ALL RIGHT HERE.
            I GOT TO GO
            TO THE POLICE.
    AAH!
                        AAH!
IT'S JUST YOU
AND ME, DAVY.
LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
        THEY WEREN'T SO GOOD.
THEY WERE FOR ME!
ARE YOU CRAZY?
YOU WENT PAST
THE RED ROCK!
            [SCREE]
            AAH!
            AAH!
    AAH!
MY FOOT!
    DAMN!
            WHOA!
AM I SUPPOSED TO BE SCARED
OF DRIFTWOOD?
HOW COME
YOU AIN'T RUNNING?
            I'VE BEEN RUNNING
            AWAY FROM YOU
            MY WHOLE LIFE!
            I'M THROUGH RUNNING!
AT LEAST
YOU HAD A LIFE.
YOU RUINED MINE.
        YOU RUINED MINE FIRST!
YOU WERE MY FRIEND
AND YOU BETRAYED ME!
        YOU THOUGHT ME WERE
        FRIENDS?
        YOU BEAT ME UP,
        YOU HUMILIATED ME.
        I'M 35 YEARS OLD.
        I STILL HAVE NIGHTMARES
        ABOUT FOURTH GRADE!
        THAT'S NOT WHAT FRIENDS
        ARE SUPPOSED TO DO
        FOR EACH OTHER.
        A FRIEND MAKES YOU FEEL
        GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.
REALLY? THEN YOU'RE
THE BEST FRIEND
I EVER HAD!
                    DAVY!
    OPEN UP, YOU IDIOTS,
    I'M A MURDERER!
    ULF.
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?
                I DID IT.
            I STOOD UP TO FANG.
GOOD FOR YOU.
            I KILLED HIM.
YOU REALLY LET HIM
HAVE IT, HUH?
        WE WERE ON TOP
        OF VERMILLION FALLS.
        I HIT HIM
        AND HE WENT OVER.
        HE'S DEAD!
GET IN THE TRUCK.
                I GOT TO CONFESS
                TO THESE GUYS.
GET IN THE TRUCK.
        JEEZ, DAVY,
        WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
    I'LL SPEND THE REST
    OF MY LIFE IN JAIL.
                STOP TALKING
                LIKE THAT.
                LET'S GET
                OUR HEADS
                TOGETHER.
                I'LL DROP YOU
                AT HOME,
                AND YOU'RE
                GOING TO GET
                SOME SLEEP.
                I'LL GO BACK
                TO OLD MILL PARK
                AND LOOK
                FOR THE BODY.
LAY LOW UNTIL I CALL YOU.
DON'T DRAW ANY ATTENTION
TO YOURSELF.
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE EVIDENCE.
            EVENING, NEIGHBOR.
    AAH!
DON'T YOU SLEEP, ART?
        MIDNIGHT IS ACTUALLY
        THE BEST TIME
        FOR LAWN CARE.
        SEE, THE SUNSHINE
        CAUSES THE GRASS
        AND SHRUBBERY
        TO BEND IN A WAY
        THAT MAKES LAWN CARE,
        MOWING AND PRUNING--
    ART.
            WHAT'S WRONG, DAVID?
I'VE DONE SOMETHING
REALLY TERRIBLE.
            YOU KILLED
            THE SHOP TEACHER.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
            WELL, IT'S JUST--
            IT'S JUST LOGICAL.
            EVERYBODY
            IN TOWN KNOWS
            THAT YOU TWO
            HAD A TWISTED
            RELATIONSHIP.
THEY DO?
            IT'S A SMALL TOWN,
            DAVID.
            PEOPLE TALK.
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M A MURDERER,
DO YOU?
            OH, WELL, DAVID,
            NOW THAT'S HARD
            FOR ME TO SAY.
            THE ONLY PERSON
            WHO CAN SAY
            IF YOU'RE A MURDERER
            OR NOT IS YOU.
            SEE,
            YOUR PERCEPTIONS
            OF TONIGHT'S EVENTS
            CREATES YOUR OWN
            INDIVIDUAL REALITY.
            IN THE END,
            IT JUST--
            IT'S ABOUT
            SEMANTICS, ISN'T IT?
        I REMEMBER
        THE FIRST TIME
        I TRIED TO KILL BETTY.
    WHAT?
            OH, LET ME FINISH.
YOU TRIED TO KILL BETTY.
                LET ME FINISH.
                OH, I SEE.
            I SEE,
            MR. HIGH AND MIGHTY.
            HEY, I DIDN'T KILL
            THE SHOP TEACHER.
            WHO KILLED
            THE SHOP TEACHER?
    SHH, SHH.
            YOU KILLED
            THE SHOP TEACHER.
            YOU KILLED HIM.
                DAD.
            WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
    OUT.
            WHAT HAPPENED
            TO YOU?
                HI, MR. LEARY.
    AAH!
        IS IT O.K.
        IF KIRBY SLEEPS OVER?
HAVE YOU SEEN
MY DAD AROUND?
        GOOD NIGHT.
                GOOD NIGHT.
        <i> NOTHING I AM DOING</i>
        <i> IS WRONG.</i>
        <i> THERE'S NOTHING WRONG.</i>
<i> [FANG]</i>
<i> YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND</i>

<i> BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD--</i>
<i> FRIEND I EVER HAD--EVER HAD.</i>
        YOU'RE ALIVE.
YOU'RE DEAD.
WOW. YOU GOT
A NICE BATHROOM.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,
STYLE MY HAIR?
LISTEN, CAN I
TAKE A SHOWER?
                    YAAAAAH!
                DAD.
    WHAT?
            YOU BOYS ARE HAVING
            A SLEEP OVER?
            IS THAT O.K.?
        YEAH.
ME AND BEN
MADE UP.
CAN'T YOU GUYS
DO THE SAME?
COME ON, BEN.
<i>CONNIE</i> IS ON.
                    COOL.
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?
WHY DID YOU STEAL
THE MOON ROCK?
                YOU'LL LAUGH.
NO, I WON'T.
        I STOLE THE MOON ROCK
            BECAUSE I WANTED
            TO BE AN ASTRONAUT.
            I'M SO STUPID.
            A GUY LIKE ME COULD
            NEVER BE SOMETHING
            GREAT LIKE THAT.
YOU DID ALL RIGHT.
            OH, YEAH, I DID
            GREAT, DIDN'T I?
NO. I'M SERIOUS.
YOU GOT A--YOU GOT
A TERRIFIC KID OUT THERE.
                THAT I DO.
    HEY.
                    YEAH?
    YOU CHIPPED
    YOUR TOOTH.
            FANG'S GONE.
    <i> I BELIEVE THAT ALL THINGS</i>
        <i> HAPPEN FOR A REASON.</i>
    <i> IN A WAY, MEETING BACK UP</i>
        <i> WITH MY BULLY</i>
    <i> WAS THE BEST THING THAT</i>
    <i> COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME.</i>
HEY, DAD.
    <i> I'D CLOSED A CHAPTER</i>
        <i> IN MY LIFE,</i>
    <i> AND WITH THE SEMESTER</i>
    <i> COMING TO AN END,</i>
    <i> IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON.</i>
                WELL, IT'S
                THE LAST ONE.
ARE YOU O.K.?
                YEAH, YEAH,
                I'M FINE.
    WOW.
WOULD YOU RETURN THIS
FOR ME?
I'LL REIMBURSE YOU
FOR THE LATE CHARGES.
        I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.
        YOU CAN PAY ME BACK
        WHEN I COME TO NEW YORK.
I'LL CALL YOU
AS SOON AS I GET THERE.
                YOU BETTER.
DAVE.
                AAH!
A GOING-AWAY PRESENT.
            YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
            DO THIS, ROSS.
I FOUND IT
AT THE FLEA MARKET.
IT'S JUST LIKE
YOUR OLD ONE,
BEFORE I TORE
HIS HEAD OFF
AND THREW HIM
IN THE RIVER.
                    THANKS.
HI, MR. BIGGER.
        HEY, BEN.
WHAT YOU GOT?
        ROSS GOT ME
        A PRESENT.
        IT'S AN
        EVEL KNIEVEL DOLL.
WHO'S THAT?
        THE ORIGINAL DRUMMER
        OF GUNS N' ROSES.
OH.
TELL KIRBY I'LL CALL HIM
WHEN WE GET TO NEW YORK.
            WELL, THIS IS IT.
YEAH, YEAH, UH,
ANYWAY, I HOPE YOU LIKE IT
AND EVERYTHING.
I GOT TO GO.
GOT STUFF TO DO.
            LISTEN, ROSS,
            IF YOU'RE EVER
            IN NEW YORK,
            LOOK US UP.

    DAD, ARE WE REALLY

            THAT'S WHY
            THEY CALL 'EM
            MOBILE HOMES, SON.
