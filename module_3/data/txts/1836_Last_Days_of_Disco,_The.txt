Hello?
Hi, honey. It's me.
I went to see the doctor today,
'Cause ever since you've been gone,
I had a pain deep down inside.
He says there's nothing
really wrong with me.
I'm just missin' my man.
So, honey, please...
come on home as soon as you can.

I heard you have a much better chance
Of getting in if you come by cab.
You're really worried about getting in?
Yes.
I thought you'd been
here several times before.
Not the front way.
They were private parties.
We came in the back.
We look really good tonight.
I'm sure we're going to get in.
Get back.
Let's get a cab.
Maybe you're right.
When we get out, don't
stop where the crowd is.
Just follow me right in.
When we get out, we just follow you in.
Yeah.
Why don't you put this on?
What?
Just until we get inside.
I don't get it.
We're all together.
Van!
Only him.
We're together. Come on, van.
This is important.
These are my friends.
You can go in, but they'll have to wait.
Hey, nice coat.
Don't worry, Jimmy. We don't care.
I can't believe it.
Yeah, what an asshole.
You know, that had nothing to do
With you guys.
Van just wanted to put me in my place.
Apparently, it happens all the time.
Jerk.
It's happened to you before?
No, but it was overdue.
You know, none of us
really wanted to go anyway.
Yeah, we're exhausted.
No, I really wanted to go.
There's Jimmy Steinway.
I can't believe it...
He's already leaving?
You like him?
I could never be interested in anyone
Who worked in advertising.
God. You were right.
This place has gotten
really hard to get into.

Tom Platt.
Oh, well, that's a lot better.

A lawyer involved in

Hey, Mcgrath!
Come back here!
It's not what you think.
I'm...
I think I'm gay.
What?
That's not possible.
How?
It's always been there, I guess.
I've only begun to acknowledge it now.
You really think you're gay?
Taxi.
I was just starting law school
When the first up-Tempo
Philadelphia international hits broke:
Some people don't
consider that disco...
Because
it's good...
But I remember feeling
absolutely electrified.
You feel electrified often.
No, but this was different.
I loved the idea that there'd be
All these great places
for people to go dancing,
After the terrible social wasteland
Of our college years. Uhff.
You've been to a lot of discos?
No. In fact, practically none.
For me, law school wasn't easy,
And I haven't had much of a social life
Since coming to the city, either.
But I still consider
myself a loyal adherent
To the disco movement.
It's a "movement"?
Sort of.
What I found terribly encouraging
Was the idea that when
the time in life came
To have a social life,
There'd be all these great places
For people to go to,
Because, as you'll remember,
For many years, there were none.
Yeah.
What I didn't realize...
is that it gets so
impossible to get into.
Let's call it a night.
No, wait. I have an idea.
Jimmy.
Here take this. Jimmy!
Take this. Jimmy!
Oh, hi.
Hi.
You're des's friend.
Yeah, hi.
Where are Marshall and Steve?
They've gone back to the hotel.
Jim, come on.
I can't believe it.
Jim, let's go.
They wanted me to apologize for them.
They were really bushed.
What a disaster.
No.
I can't believe it.

Do you like nightmares?
No.
Well, I do.
It's not obviously connected, but...
I think that's what made
me a little more tolerant
Of the guys at Hampshire.
What do you mean?
You were a bit critical.
The guys there preferred
women more... "laid-Back."
I'm laid-Back.
For whatever reason,
You didn't have much
of a social life there.
I had a
social life...
Just not one of those
terrible pretend-Marriages.
The Hampshire guys were jerks,
Hippy-Dippy suburbanites
with all this hair...
And extremely dim
intellectual interests.
I'm sorry, I don't
consider the guy who did
The Spiderman comics a serious writer.
Alice, one thing I've noticed
Is that people hate being criticized.
Everyone hates that.
It's one of the great
truths of human nature.
I think it's why my
parents got divorced.
I'm sorry... It's just
that you're so terrific...
It makes me sick to think
that you might get in
That terrible situation again,
Where everyone
hated you...
Hated me?
You're wonderful.
Maybe, in physical terms,
I'm a little cuter than you,
but you should be much
more popular than I am...
it would be such a shame
If what happened in
college repeated itself.
Why would it repeat itself?
You're right.
I just think it's so important
To be in control of
your own destiny...
Not to fall into that fifties cliche
Of waiting by the
phone for guys to call:
The right ones never do.
Those who do,
You have to make the most
ridiculous excuses to:
The nice ones get hurt
feelings and hate you;
The jerks inevitably corner you
Into going out anyway.
Late at night you find yourself
With some awful guy
with disgusting breath,
Thrusting his belly up against you,
Trying to stick his slobbering tongue
In your mouth. Ugh, yecch.
Thank god this is a
whole new era in music
And social models!
We're in complete control.

It's too bad Steve and

They really would have loved this.
Don't worry about it. So what.
It's so stupid.
I'm sure it's Jimmy.
I think it's much better to wait
Until things happen naturally.
Forcing things never works.
That's not true.
Forcing things usually
works beautifully.
You know, even if he's in advertising,
Someone will want him.
I just think it's so important
That we be in control
of our own destinies.
It doesn't matter.
Marshall's a really good guy.
He doesn't really care
about this kind of stuff.
I can't believe it.
Uh, excuse me...
has anyone ever told
you you look just like
Kate Preston's brother rod?
Who?
Rod Preston. Do you know him?
Uh, no.
Have you ever noticed that
people who look just alike
Never seem to know each other?
Hunh.
Hi.
Hey. How've you been?
Fine. How are you?
He's really depressed.
God, isn't this place great?
It's fantastic! I love it.
I really like this song.
Yeah.
Do you like to dance?
W- W-Would
you?
Sure. Great.
Shall we all go?
I... I think he's
too depressed to dance.
Hey, Jimmy, we're
going to dance... Come on.
I'm too depressed to dance.
Go ahead.
What's wrong?
Absolute disaster.
What?
I had to get some clients into the club,
So I gave the boss
my coat to wear...
"Here, wear this."
It's really stupid.
I can't believe what an idiot I am.
Why? Your coat's nice.
Well, that's just it: It is nice.
But this guy's...
Marshall's...
Clothes are hideous.
It's famous.
But to give him my
coat to put over them...
It's so stupid.
It's just really stupid.
It's not stupid.
This club's really hard to get into.
It was unbelievably, incredibly dumb.
He's a really nice
guy, and I insulted him.
This nice guy that I stupidly insulted
Is basically my boss.
God, it was really stupid.
Guess you're right.
It was pretty stupid.
Uh, can I get you a drink?
Yeah, thanks.

I sensed I was somehow...
different.

I get up late and

Sort of as a reflex.
Wednesday afternoon,
There was a rerun of wild kingdom,
Mutual of Omaha's nature
program with marlin Perkins
And that... attractive, younger guy.
It triggered something.
Suddenly everything fell into place.

You only found out you were gay
On Wednesday?
Only then definitively.
Wednesday was...
gay day for me.

I wasn't eavesdropping.

Shh. God!
Listen, it's much better
you're with Tom than Jimmy.
You two really look great together.
You think so?
It's too bad we weren't
closer friends in college.
I think I could really
have helped you there.
For most guys,
Sexual repressiveness is a turn-Off.
You're saying this for my benefit?
You're a good conversationalist but...
there's something of
the kindergarten teacher
About you.
It's really nice, but...
the guys you like also tend
to be on the ethereal side.
It can get pretty far away
From any kind of physicality.
This is gonna sound
dumb, but it really works.
Whenever you can,
Throw the word "sexy"
into your conversation.
It's kind of a signal.

"there's something really
sexy about strobe lights."
Or, uh...
"this fabric is so sexy."
Yeah, it is.

And pretty smart, in

but I was out of place there.

Who did the Spiderman
comics a serious writer.
Yeah, I thought it was the green hornet
People took more seriously.

vodka-Tonic to give you,
but I'm afraid I sampled it.
I'll get you another.
Jimmy's gone?
You're "hap"?
Yeah, he wanted me to
tell you he's sorry,
but he was ejected from the club.
He was ejected?
Apparently he snuck one of his clients
In the back of the club.

I never told him.
It's uncanny.
You mean, it's a complete cliche?
"All women recent college
graduates drink vodka-Tonics,"
Or something like that?
Well, maybe.
So Jimmy think's I'm a total cliche
I ordered a vodka-Tonic,

How did you get involved

I think that's great.
You're interested in the environment?
Very much so.
Actually, there's one theory
That the environmental
movement of our day
Was sparked by the re-Release of bambi
In the late 1950s.
For many members of the
baby boom generation,
It was traumatic...
the hunters killing bambi's mother.
Yeah, it was terrible.
For 6-Year-Olds,
it's devastating.
To this day, no one wants to identify
With those hunters.

Do you know how long it takes
To become an editor?
You mean associate editor.
Yeah. Associate editor.
What's the minimum amount of time
To become an associate editor?
How many years?
That's hard to say.
Approximately.
Maybe 4 years.
But more than years,
Before you can become
an associate editor,
You have to have a best seller.
How can you be sure
you'll get a best seller?
You cannot.
But what if you don't find one?
You have to.
Show them the outline.
You might want to see this.
It's the Scott Meredith
best seller outline.
"Create sympathetic characters,
"With whom readers identify.
Give them problems,
make these problems big."
Could I photocopy this?
Yes, but I need it back.
I'd like a copy, too.
That stuff is such crap.
This does describe a
lot of best sellers.
That's true.
It's completely formulaic.
Of course it's
formulaic. It's a formula.
That's why I prefer nonfiction.
It's good you want to
be an editor so much.
In this era of television,
You are devoted to the printed word.
Actually, ultimately,
I'd like to work in television.
But right now, what I need's a raise.
Alice and I have been
looking at apartments,
but we can't afford one on
what we get as assistants.
That's so comical.
What?
That giris like you really
worry about paying rent.
Aren't your fathers heavily subsidizing
Your living expenses
with big allowances?
They're not big at all.
In a few years, you'll marry
Some incredibly rich corporate lawyers.
It's not as if you really
worry about paying the rent
Like the rest of us.
Oh, you worry about paying the rent?
Yeah.
Then you're way ahead of us
'Cause we don't even have an apartment.
What if, in a few years,
We don't marry some corporate lawyer?
What if we marry some meatball like you?
But not you personally,
but someone with similarly
low socioeconomic prospects?
Can you believe that?
They really think that way.
Disco sucks.
What a dope.
Would you ever go out
With anyone who worked in the company?
Fortunately,
There's absolutely no temptation.
Charlotte, telephone.
It's a man.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
We were thinking of having
some people for dinner
Saturday night.
Wanted to know if you could come.
About 7:30.
Ok. Where?
Actually, I'll have to
call you back with that.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Ok.
Bye.
That was Jimmy Steinway.
He's coming for dinner Saturday night.
You called him?
I thought you said you
could never be interested
In anyone who worked in advertising.
No one could say something
like that seriously.
It was obviously a joke.
Anyway, it's not like
it's a date or anything.
He's invited as part of a group.
It's really important
There be more group social life,
Not just all this ferocious pairing off.
You like Tom.
Invite him.
We don't even have an apartment.
How can we have a dinner party?
Well, it's another incentive to get one.
Does the Lexington avenue
express stop at 86th street?
I think so.
We'd better hurry.
Do you really think we
know each other well enough
To room together?
Well, maybe that's good.
It's not just that we
don't know each other well.
I'm not even sure we
really like each other.
That's ok.
You know, Alice,
I'm not so much of a
bitch as I might seem.
You'll find holly's a little sensitive
About her intelligence.
She's dumb?
Harvard guys, even the ones that
Seem reasonably cool on the outside,
Are all essentially wimps and bookworms
On the inside.
They love being seen out
with this lovely girl,
but after a date or two,
Rather than risk rejection,
They pretend to drop her,
Going around complaining
about how dull she was.
Is she dull?
A little, but that's not the point.
Once you start worrying
about something like that,
You're lost.
Holly was devastated.
She stopped dating entirely,
And weekends either went home
Or just hung around the
library at pine manor.
What do you think you're doing?
Shove off, Mack!
Deviant!
Creep! Off!
So I wouldn't develop any illusions
About Harvard guys.
They can be amazing creeps, too.
Ah, there you are.
Hi.
Our friend still isn't here.
Sorry. I forgot which
way the numbers went
On the east side.
It's what's called a railroad apartment.
It's long and rather
narrow like a railroad car.
Each room opens directly onto the other.
It's very nice.
The closets are here.
This is the other bedroom.
The bathroom is back here at this end.
And the kitchen.
So to get to the bathroom
from the living room,
You have to clomp through both bedrooms?
Well, there are 2 outside doors,
So in theory,
You can use the exterior hall
To go between the kitchen
and the living room.
Huh.
Even with 2 roommates, the
layout is a bit awkward.
You can't afford something bigger?
We all work in book publishing.
Couldn't your parents help?
They already are.
So what do you think?
I think it's really nice.
Isn't the layout a bit awkward?
Well, I think we should take it.
Here you go.
It's good to see bourgeois giris
Building up a sweat.
Why is that good to see?
You live around here?
There was a guild
meeting at asphalt green.
A guild meeting?
The newspaper guild
is organizing clerical
And editorial staff for book publishing.
I'm supposed to organize our department.
Oh, my god. We're all
gonna lose our jobs.
You should support this.
You were just complaining
how lousy the pay is.
Are you rooming with them?
That's gonna be really tough.
Aren't we behind schedule?
Nope. This recipe's extremely fast.
Hello.
Uh, it's Dan.
Dan?
Hi. Come up.
Dan from your department.
I invited him.
Departmental Dan?
You know...
he went to Harvard.
So?
Yeah, I've got to meet
some clients at 10:00
And get them into the club.
Tom isn't coming?
If he does, he'll be very late.
Isn't this what they
call a railroad apartment?
Uh-Huh.
People always say how terrible they are,
but it seems pretty nice.
Well, the layout's not so good.
It's amazing the little things in life
One doesn't appreciate
until they're missing,
Such as hallways.
These apartments were actually planned
In the last century as tenement housing
For working class families.
Now all the yuppie roommate combos
Are crowding them out.
Well...
that's just tough.
Fight!
Rumble!
Actually, I was thinking I'd go home.
What?
You should come.
I don't know.
I'm not really a disco type.
Well, who is?
I probably wouldn't get in anyway.
Of course you'll get
in. Holly's gorgeous.

Thanks, Jimmy.
Have fun, jack, harry.
Thanks a lot, des. I
really appreciate it.
Fine, cool.
I'm starting to realize how
important eye contact is.
I can't talk to people in this thing.
They get nervous. They
don't know who I am.
Well, that's the point.
You think tonight would be a good time
To talk to van?
Try to patch things up,
get a reprieve of some sort?
Uh, no.
My job's sort of on the line, des.
And not all clients
will be such good sports
As harry and jack.
If it's a question of groveling,
I can do that.
Just point me in the right direction.
Shh! God!

Yeah. Manny hanny used to be a client.

God. Paying a cover
charge to get into a club?
How humiliating.
That's your reaction?
Look at this.
Kind of worrisome, don't you think?
Yeah.
To me, shipping cash to Switzerland
In canvas bags
Doesn't sound honest.
To me, it suggests possible illegality.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Well, I'm not going
into that room anymore.
Uh, gimlet, please?
Domestic beer or bud?
Um... whiskey sour?
Excuse me.
You're Alice Kinnon, aren't you?
Yeah.
We met at that party in sag harbor,
Labor day weekend.
You were just coming
in as I was leaving,
And you asked me where the kitchen was.
Do you remember?
I do remember getting to the kitchen.
Uh, excuse us.
We're here sort of as a group.
If you don't mind?
Excuse me.
Why did you say that?
I didn't like the look of him at all.
Didn't you notice how
he was eyeballing you?
Creepy.
Frankly, I thought he
might've been the guy
That bothered me on the subway.
I'm sorry if I overreacted.
Poor guy.
It's no big deal.
That kind of thing happens all the time.
Anyway, you've got Tom.

Do you remember the conversation we had
Labor day weekend?
Had a huge impact on me.
Really?
Jennifer and I had been talking all year
About either acknowledging
The permanence of our
relationship and marrying
Or finally just breaking up.
I had no idea you were
even dating anyone.
I thought you knew.
No. We've been together since college.
But the weekend after labor day,
We had this long talk.
Jennifer proposed a trial separation,
Which normally I'd have
considered ridiculous,
but I couldn't help thinking of you
And went along.
Out of some sort of
Residual loyalty to Jennifer,
I didn't call you immediately
And instead started coming to the club.
I'm not a very
good dancer, but...
No, you are.
I was also curious if
the sexual revolution
Went as far as everyone said it had.
But emotionally, I couldn't handle it.
I got so depressed, and...
when I saw you that night,
You were... a vision,
Not just of loveliness, but of...
virtue...
and sanity.
What?
I shouldn't talk about it.
I'll just end up sounding like an idiot.
No, what?
You're very sexy
And good-Looking and modern and hot.
But what I was craving
Was a sort of sentient individual
Who wouldn't abandon her intelligence
To hop into bed with every guy she meets
In a nightclub.
Why... why is it that when people have
Sex-With-Strangers
on their mind,
Their I.Q. Just drops, like, 40 points?
All that affected
Sexy seductress slinking around?
And uncle scrooge is sexy?
I mean, my god, is there no limit?
No. That
was to...
Do you think I'm an idiot?
I'm so sick of all
the lies and nonsense!
Alice?
Alice, what's wrong?
What happened?
Mcgrath! Where is he?
I'd say it's definitely not a good idea
To approach van tonight.
There he is.
Mcgrath!
Drew Mcgrath.
You're out of here right now.
What?
Bernie. Bernie!
Where is he? Here he is.
Bernie, this guy's through.
What's going on?
We had a public safety
situation in the front.
This jerk comes out,
trying to make it worse.
Is this true?
Public safety situation?
Give me a break.
It was a joke. I'm sorry.
We had a public safety situation.
The cops came. It was no joke.
I tease him a tiny bit.
No teasing, des.
No teasing?
Either he goes or I do.
Come on, van. Des, grow up.
Cut it out.
Ok. Sorry.
It's the ad guy.
So, it's the dancing ad man.
You're finished.
Ok, I work in advertising.
Is that a crime?
What's happening in this country?
There they are! Get 'em!
Get the tin man. Get him.
Get this jerk out of the club.
You're fired, des. You're out of here.
You can't fire me, van.
Only Bernie can fire me.
Ok.
You're fired.
And take this yuppie scum with you.
Good riddance!
Yuppie scum?
In college, before dropping out,
I took a course in the
propaganda uses of language.
One objective is to deny
other people's humanity
Or even right to exist.
In the men's lounge,
Someone scrawled "kill yuppie scum."
Do yuppies even exist?
No one says, "I am a yuppie."
It's always the other
guy who's a yuppie.
I think for a group to exist,
Somebody has to admit to be part of it.
Of course yuppies exist.
Most people would say you
two are prime specimens.
We're not yuppies!
You think we're yuppies?
You're seriously saying
you're not yuppies?
No.
Yuppie stands for "young
upwardly mobile professional."
Nightclub flunky is not
a professional category.
Contrary to popular belief,
Junior-Level ad jobs
don't pay well at all.
I wish we were yuppies:
Young, upwardly mobile, professional.
Those are good things, not bad things.
Where we going?
Rex's. Oh, no.
What's wrong with rex's?
Well, you can't dance there,
And it's full of boring preppies.
Oh, and we're so interesting.
You can dance at rex's.
Yeah, but why rex's?
Why not some other place?
Well, for one thing,
Everyone at the club
knows that I go there,
So when they come looking for me,
I wanna be there.
Why would they come looking for you?
What happened tonight was a mistake,
Which even now Bernie's
probably very much regretting.
He's a smart guy.
Not without good qualities...
even if very few.
I wouldn't be very surprised
if he's already called rex's
To retract my dismissal.
How can you be so sure of that?
Well, I'm not sure of it.

Hey. Hey, rex.
Welcome to rex's.
Alice, you look like you've seen
The dark side of the moon.
What did Tom say?
No. I feel much better.
I love your idea of
social life as a group,
Without all this ferocious pairing off.
I couldn't have stood
being alone tonight.
I thought Bernie was smarter than that.
What a blunder.
When they do call, we'll
get you immediately.
Thanks, rex.
Rex is such a great guy.
Yeah. Charlotte says she can
tell if a guy's gay or not
Just by looking in his eyes.
How?
Maybe it's related to
how they look at you.
It's hard to define,
but I think women can tell.
I can't.
Are Jimmy or I gay?
Come on, don't.
Jimmy?
No.
Well, not your eyes,
but you do have a gay mouth.
A gay mouth?
I have a gay mouth?
What does that mean?
Just what I said.
It's true, des. Your
mouth does look gay.
God! How moronic can you get?
What nonsense!
Don't think I don't know your whole act.
Excuse me?
Pretending to be gay
To get sympathy from women
While cruelly dumping them,
And to seem cooler
than you actually are.
I despise your whole pathetic act.
You're not fit to lick the boots
Of my real gay friends.
Well, I don't want to lick the boots
Of your real gay friends.
You know, I could be gay.
I see through you completely.
Oh, you see through me completely.
Yeah, I do.
That's the dark side of feminism.
What?
You have a kind of free pass
to make any kind of wounding
Or derogatory comment you want.
I am hardly a militant feminist.
No, you're not.
A militant feminist
would be a lot fairer.
It's women like you
whose attitudes to men
are so dehumanizing.
Like what?
That men are swine,
Obsessed with large breasts
And the sex act,
Devoid of any idealistic
or romantic sensibility
When in fact,
We have that idealistic sensibility
In spades.
For instance, you have no idea
What men really think
about women's breasts.
What do men think about women's breasts?
Well, it's not something
you just blurt out.
It's far more complicated
and nuanced than that.
Ok, I'll tell you a story.
When I was in college,
There was a girl I had a crush on
Who always had older boyfriends,
Invariably some senior.
Finally, they all graduated,
And one night we went
back to her room alone.
Suddenly, her shirt was off,
And I was confronted with these breasts,
Which turned out to be
completely surprising
And frankly, disconcerting.
They were rather large and not ugly
Or especially strange-Shaped,
but in all the time that
I had thought about her,
These breasts had never figured.
She took off her shirt so quickly,
There was no time for adjustment,
And I said something arrogant about it,
As if her abrupt unveiling
of her largish breasts
Was somehow going to
slay my swinish male self,
As if I hadn't already been slayed
On a much higher level.
Her name was Alice, too.
Oh, come on, des.
You know that's not true.
What do you mean, it isn't true?
Her name wasn't Alice.
Well, I'm not gonna use her real name.
Would you like to dance?
Do you mind?

If what's bothering you relates to Tom,
I wouldn't take it personally.
Did you know Tom and Jennifer
Had a trial separation,
Which was to end tonight?
What you might not know
Is that about a week ago,
They started seeing
each other on the sly,
Cheating on their trial separation.
How do you know that?
Working at the club,
You find out all kinds of things.
You know, this is the way
people used to dance in bars
In the old days.
Do people ever really dance in bars?
I thought that was a myth.
People my older brother's
age, uh, they did.
Your brother must be a lot older.
Before disco,
This country was a dancing wasteland.
You know the woodstock
generation of the 1960s
That were so full of themselves
And conceited?
None of those people could dance.

That, for a moment, I flinched.
She dropped me like a rock.
I was crushed.
I couldn't take it, so I dropped out
And got in the night
club business early,
Thanks to which
I probably owe my success today.
Let's share a cab.
We're thinking of going.
You're all going?
Yeah.
Have they called yet from the club?
I don't think they will call.
Bernie will probably send some emissary.
That's more his style.
What should we do with the oz costumes,
Just, uh, bring 'em
by the club tomorrow?
Actually, those costumes are mine.
Just get 'em back to me when you can.
I thought we were here as a group.
You talked about the
tremendous importance
Of group social life.
Well, it's really late.
Yeah, Alice, it's getting really late.
We'd better get going.
Hey, thanks again, des.
Ciao.
Bye.
Bye.
All week charlotte's been talking about
The tremendous importance
of group social life,
Opposing all this ferocious pairing off.
Well, group social life has its place,
but at a certain point,
Other biological factors come into play.
Our bodies weren't really designed
For group social life.
A certain amount of pairing off
Was always part of the original plan.
God, I can't believe you'd say that.
What?
What did I say?
What you mean to say is
that they've all gone back
To screw their brains out?!
No, I didn't say that!
I said they were going to pair off.
Well, wait, don't go!
I didn't mean to say anything
Anyone could be offended by.
Oh, thank god. He's here.
Des, Bernie regrets what happened.
It was a mistake, and he wants you back.
I'm sorry. I know why you're so upset.
I mean, I know what really happened with Tom.
What?!
That he thought you were really slutty or something.
That's so stupid!
You can't worry about
what misinterpreters think!
That's so unfair!
Come back to my place. We should talk.
Nothing will happen!
I just need somebody to talk to.
Maybe you do, too.

All the
noise...
Clomping around, banging pans.
Sorry. I didn't realize it.
You obviously intended it.
What do you mean?
That's very aggressive.
You don't clomp around, banging pans
For no reason.
Like what reason?
You know perfectly well.
Because I only bang pans?

Oh.
I'd like to bring it up

Other people liked it, too?
Yeah.
Ok. I'll take another look.

That was so moving,
What you said about our
obligation to writers.
Thanks.
And how often we fall short of that.
Well, let's face it,
Most authors are still conceited dopes.
Oh, you... You
can't say that.
You're an editor.
You don't have to deal
with them on a daily basis.
When you're an assistant,
It's harder to dodge their calls.
Good going, Alice.
I'm really glad we got this book.
I understand that you know

Do you think that maybe, um,
Sometime you could, uh,
get us in there some night?
Yeah. Certainly. We'll arrange that.
Very good. Thanks.

You've kind of set up office there.
None of the rest of us has any privacy.

Yeah, that's true, but it's just odd
That you're so much friendlier to Jimmy

Jesus. Josh, you're a mess.
I'm a mess.
I got to talk to you.
You sure you don't want
to clean up a little?
It's kind of serious.
I'll look for Alice and charlotte,
See if they've come in.
That's Audrey Rouget,
The youngest person
ever to be made an editor
In the history of farrar, Straus.
How do you know her?
She interviewed me.
How did it go?
Have you ever been in an interview
And gotten the impression they
see through you completely?
I didn't get an offer.
You don't want to clean up a little?
No.
You know, you look really bad.
I know. That's actually good in my work.
It puts people at
ease, looking like this.
They feel, frankly, superior to me
And say things they ordinarily wouldn't.
It's very disarming.
Phew! What happened?!
I was having drinks
With some friends in the village,
And there was this terrible guy
Really bothering this girl,
So I decided to intervene,
but it turns out they were married.
What's this now? You're not here
On official business, are you?
Knowing that we went
to college together,
They asked me to talk to you.
Who is "they"?
I can't tell you.
I couldn't believe you'd be involved
In the kinds of things
That have been going on here
And told them so.
I consider you a person
of some integrity,
Except, you know,
In your relations with women.

Ok, the tortoise won one race.
Do you think the hare

Any more races to
turtles? Not on your life.
I liked that tortoise.
So do I, but if you
were a betting person,
Would you say, "that
tortoise won against the hare.
In future races I'm backing him"?
No. That race was
almost certainly a fluke,
And, afterwards, the
tortoise is still a tortoise,
And the hare, a hare.

Alice.
I am so, so sorry.
I should never have said that.
I have some sort of sick compulsion
To say everything that occurs to me.
I just want to let you know,
As soon as I can find
a new rooming situation,
I'm moving out. I can't take it anymore.
It's not possible.
You're not serious.
Just let me know when
you're ready to go.
Ok.
Please, Alice.
Rooming with you and holly
Has been the most important thing
To happen to me in my life.
You're the first woman
friends I've ever had.
The anger you're feeling now
Is actually more
justified than you know.
When we were at Hampshire,
I really hated you.
You seemed so moralistic and judgmental.
I had no idea, then,
how you really were.
When guys wanted to ask you out,
I'd talk them out of it.
Oh, my god. I can't
believe how evil I was.
But I've completely changed.
If you will give me another chance,
I'll be the best friend you've ever had.
If the apartment situation
weren't so impossible,
I'd move out now.
I can understand how
you'd feel that way.
You're right to.
But things aren't always as they seem.
Bad and inexcusable as
what I said back there
Might have been, I think you'll find
It'll actually improve your reputation
With these guys enormously.
You'll be more popular than ever. Watch.
Vd's not all bad.
You'll find there are actually
Positive aspects to it.
What?
Well, you know that "please inform
All previous partners" thing?
It's actually a terrific way
To get back in touch
With guys you might have liked,
but have lost contact with.
Just in my own experience,
It's twice led to renewed relationships
With guys that lasted quite a while
And were really... sweet.
I'm not talking about herpes infections,
Which are far more serious
And apparently incurable,
Just standard vd and other conditions
Easily treatable with antibiotics.
God, are you following me or something?
You said you weren't taking anything.
Well, I'm not. It was a gift.
I never buy the stuff,
And anyway, it hardly affects me.
Oh, no.
Actually, what I'm high about
Is the situation with Alice.
This makes her seem
much more accessible.
She's not operating on a plane
So far removed from the rest of us.
There's hope for me.
What did josh want to talk to you about?
Is everything ok?
Uh, no... not exactly.
I'm sorry to bug you about this,
but I'd be really grateful
If we could talk with van soon.
The way it's going, if I
can't get people in here,
I'm going to lose my job.
Des! You lied to me!
I thought you were a wonderful man,
but it was all lies!
No!
You said you loved me!
And then you said you were gay,
but you're not!
Everyone knew but me!
You completely humiliated me!
I could be gay.
You're saying again you're gay?
Tell me honestly,
Have you had sex with men?!

Between games, as planned,
A huge box containing
thousands of disco records
Was blown up.
The rest was unplanned.
Fans stormed out onto the
field in the thousands.
Disco records were hurled like frisbees.
Bonfires were set. Bottles where thrown.
The batting cage was
torn down and destroyed.
Fistfights broke out.
Manhattan district
attorney Robert Morgenthau,
At his press conference,
Congratulated prosecutors on
their successful convictions
In the probe of...
...speaking for the first time
on his real estate task force's
18 convictions of executives
at 6 commercial brokerages,
Promised a vigorous prosecution
Of corporate and white collar crime
In a wide-Ranging series
of investigations...
I'll just be a second.
Alice, congratulations on the TV sale.
Thanks.
Hi.
Hi.
How's holly?
Fine.
Is she, um, going out with anyone?
Yeah, this really nice guy
who went to Denver university
And works in real estate.
He found her this
incredibly cheap apartment.
She no longer lives with you guys?
You hold what happened against me.
Not that you broke up,
Just that you go out with people
Based primarily on looks.
Holly's also very nice.
A lot of people are nice.
You only asked out the
fabulously good-Looking one.
You hold that against me.
Well, pretty shallow.
You know, Alice, except for politics,
We've got a lot in common.
We're both pretty serious
And, I think, respect each other's
Bases for judgment.
Occasionally,
I get reactionary thoughts, too.
I'm not reactionary.
Well, aesthetically.
Oh, well, aesthetically.
You mean you think I gave it to you?
How can you be sure?
I'm sure.
Well, you were a lot
more active than I was.
You were obviously very experienced.
No.
Oh, come on.
How did you know all that?
Well, I read a lot.
You must've been with some guys.
You weren't a virgin.
I didn't consider myself a virgin,
But...
what?
I don't know.
Technically...
what?
If I'm making love,
The man... spurts...
outside the woman,
Does that count as sexual intercourse?
"Spurts"?
If it squirts outside,
without getting in,
Does that count as
losing your virginity?
No part of the man got in at any time?
I don't think so.
I think part has to get in...
to be considered sexual intercourse.
So then I was a virgin.
Oh... I can't believe that.
The first time
you make love, I...
I give you both "g"
and an "h" infection.
"H"?
Your move.
I'm beginning to think that maybe
That old system of
people getting married
Based on mutual respect
and shared aspirations,
And then slowly, over time,
Earning each other's
love and admiration,
Worked the best.
Well, we'll never know.
Almost ready.
God, waiting around all night
For the unemployed guy
to get around to shaving.
You're so busy you can't
shower until midnight?
Excuse me. Unemployed is not who I am.
I'm a fully-Employed person
Who just happens not
to have a job right now,
Largely because of
some structural problems
In the advertising industry.
I'm sorry. That was
really inconsiderate.
Please forgive me.
♪ Spin me ♪
♪ ♪ All around the floor... ♪
Of course, if
you talk enthusiastically
About your work in advertising,
You sound like a total cretin.
No. Your enthusiasm
Is actually enormously appealing.
In fact, I used to not think so well
Of people in advertising,
but it's one of the great things
About getting out of college
and into the real worid,
How experience changes
and improves your views.
During college, I
remember seeing couples
With crying babies and
thinking "how horrible."
Lately, I've been spending a lot of time
With my niece and nephew.
Saturday, I took my niece, who's 7,
To see the Disney movie,
Lady and the tramp. She loved it,
Was so cute.
I'm beginning to fall in love
With the whole idea of having kids.
I hate that movie.
What?
It's so... tacky,
Not to mention depressing.
This sweet movie about
cute cartoon dogs,
You found depressing?
There is something depressing about it.
And it's not really about dogs.
Except for some superficial
bow-Wow stuff at the start,
The dogs all represent human types,
Which is where it
gets into real trouble.
Lady, the ostensible protagonist,
Is a fluffy blonde cocker spaniel
With absolutely nothing on her brain.
She's great-Looking,
but... Let's be honest...
Incredibly insipid.
Tramp, the love interest,
Is a smarmy braggart of
the most obnoxious kind:
An oily jailbird out for a piece of tail
Or whatever he can get.
Come on.
No. He's a self-Confessed chicken thief
And all-Around sleazeball.
What's the function
of a film of this kind?
Essentially, it's a
primer on love and marriage
Directed at very young people,
Imprinting on their
little psyches the idea
That smooth-Talking delinquents
Recently escaped from the local pound
Are a good match for nice
giris from sheltered homes.
When in 10 years, the icky human version
Of tramp shows up around the house,
Their hormones will be racing,
And no one'll understand
why. Films like this
Program women to adore jerks.
God, you're nuts.
The only sympathetic character,
The little scotty who's so
loyal and concerned about lady,
Is mocked as old-Fashioned
and irrelevant
And shunted off to the side.
Isn't the whole point
that tramp changes?
Ok, maybe in the past he stole chickens,
Ran around without a license,
And wasn't always sincere
With members of the opposite sex.
But through his love for lady
And the beneficent influences
Of fatherhood and
matrimony, he changes...
and becomes a valued member of that,
You know, rather idyllic household.
I don't think people
really change that way.
We can change our context,
but we can't change ourselves.
What does that mean?
Well, you've changed.
Come on, des.
That's a little different.
I agree with josh.
The scotty is the only
admirable character.
It would have been a much better movie
If lady'd ended up with him.
I'm really surprised.
I think tramp really changed.
Maybe he wanted to
change, or tried to change,
but there's not a lot
of integrity there.
First, he'd be hanging around the house,
Drinking and watching ball games
And maybe knocking lady around a bit,
but pretty soon he'll be back
Down at the town dump chasing tail.
Oh, give me a break.
Are you taking your medication,
'Cause what you're saying is
Completely nuts! God, des...
no! I think people should know
That our friend here
has a certain condition.
How can Morgenthau shut up! Employ you?
He knows about mass. Mental health
And the loony tunes junior year?
Of course he knows about it.
God!
Jimmy, do you know where Alice is?
No. I don't know where she is.
Uh, excuse me.
Were you at Leo Burnett in Chicago?
Oh, my god, how are you?
Um, do you know betty?
Jimmy Steinway, hi.
Hi.
Are you still with ishmoco?
Yeah. There's a sales
conference at the Americana.
I'm actually with the
international side now,
based in Spain.
How's that?
Barcelona's beautiful,
But, in human terms, uh, pretty cold.
How 'bout you?
I was at Mccallum, but just got sacked.
Have you found anything else?
No.
Any leads?
No.
You know, there're a
lot of agencies in Spain
Looking for people with
experience from here.
There's one in Madrid
Some Burnett people
have affiliated with.
I could give 'em a call.
That sounds great.
Michael.
Good times.
I don't identify with tramp at all.
I was just sticking up for him
Because no one else was.
I actually identify
With the loyal scotty dog, too.

No, but now there's a real conflict.

You iron your own shirts?
Well, if I'm going to court,
I wear a laundry-Ironed shirt,
But, otherwise, I do it myself.
That's a great moment in life
When you can start
Sending all your shirts
out for laundering.
At the agency, after my last promotion,
I briefly had that.
In any case, I doubt I'll
be working there much longer.
What?
I'm thinking of quitting.
You can't do that.
Why not? What's it to you?
You assured me if I helped you,
You'd be around to protect des.
Well, the situation's changed.
How's it changed?
I can't say.
You can't say.
Maybe Des is more
involved than I thought.
Or more involved with someone you know.
That's a conflict, josh.
I still can't believe Alice
is really serious about des.
Why not?
She seems smarter than that.
That doesn't matter. There's something
Deeply ingrained in human biology.
Women prefer bad over
weak and indecisive
And unemployed.
I don't know about that.
You think they do
prefer weak, indecisive,
And unemployed?

You hardly know me, des.
I care about ideas.
I care about them a lot.
Did you know that in college,
My senior paper was on Ernest Hemingway?
Thanks, baby.
I'm not a nice person, des.
But some things are important,
Such as loyalty.
Loyalty's not eyewash,
not like niceness.
I've been loyal to you, des.
I could've fired you, lots of times,
but never did.
Maybe you're not aware of this, des,
but there's some sort of
investigation underway.
I think to myself,
"how could this happen?
"How could they get this information?
"Has some disgruntled employee,
"Former or current, informed on us?
"Is there some sort of spy here?
How could agents even get in?"
I mean, really,
They would stand out in this crowd
And, normally, not get past the door.
Do you know how they got in?
Uh, no. Could van be letting them in?
They're coming in as ad agency clients.
What?
Oh, I can't believe it.
After all I did for that guy.
So, you don't know anything
about this investigation?
No! Well, a sort of acquaintance of mine
Who now works in Morgenthau's
office approached me,
but I didn't tell him anything.
You didn't tell me about that.
I didn't think it was important.
It only just happened.
When? Tonight. Just now.

I used the past perfect?
Yeah. "I was approached..."

I haven't told you anything.
There was some leak
at the precinct level.
Bernie had an informant,
but it's been fixed.
It's not a problem any longer.
It's a problem.
I've never said anything to you.
You have to make that clear to everyone.
That doesn't matter.
What?
When everything comes down,
It's gonna be very rough.
Your whole life will
be open for examination,
And it might not look so good.
Cut out the drugs, des.
What?
Don't make such a spectacle
of yourself as a drug user.
Don't receive them, don't consume them,
And don't pass them on to others.
What are you talking about?
You could be charged with dealing.
Dealing? Those were gifts!
Well...
who's accusing me of this?
This is you, isn't it, josh?

Ciao. Good night.

Oh, god!
Oh, my god!
I didn't know anything about it.
The agency just funneled
Clients they wanted to get
into the club through me.
Usually, before I got into the car,
I hadn't even met them.
I just assumed they were
clients from out of town.
That the I.R.S. Was our largest client
Didn't occur to me then.
I swear I didn't know
anything about it, des,
At first.
You scumbag.
Josh promised me you'd be protected.
Oh, great. What's a little shocking
Is that they'd do something
so obvious and clumsy
And move so fast,
No matter how richly I
may feel you deserved it.
These were just some creeps
Mad van'd turned them away before.
Van's operating under
tremendous pressure.
I'm starting to feel a lot
of sympathy for the guy.
Oh, great. That's priceless.
You and van, oh, I love that.
Oh!
Want a snort?
Guess not.
I have a very bad feeling
about the club, des.
It's like a meteorite is
headed straight for it.
It's gonna destroy everything.
The greatest club the
worid has ever seen
Is going to be smashed to smithereens.
Yeah, well, I don't think
it'll be a meteorite.
Bye.
Alice and I are having
breakfast together.
It's a date. You can't come.
Sorry.
Try to get some sleep.
That's what guys do
who want to date you?
They say they have a book idea?
Maybe.
Did he say what the book was?
He said he had some crazy ideas
For a book on the
criminal justice system.
Of course. That makes sense.
Crazy ideas are the kind
that josh would have.
Be careful of that guy.
I was there when he flipped out.
Really scary.
He got up on a table at a
cafeteria off Harvard square
And started weirdly singing this hymn.
Apparently, religious
mania is highly typical
Of manic depression
entering its manic phase.
Josh is not just your
garden-Variety loon.
He is a serious nutcase.
What gets me is that
this serious nutcase
Now presumes to judge others.
You really think the
neurological effects of coffee
Is similar to that of cocaine?
That's what I read somewhere.
In addition to amazing stories,
There are a lot
Of entertaining prosecutors' anecdotes.
And then there's the whole culture
Of the downtown legal district.
It could be good.
Like everything, it all
depends on execution.
This is sort of related.
It's an article I wrote for Harper's
During law school.
Did you really just want to have lunch
To discuss a book proposal?
Um... no.
How serious are you and des?
Is it absolutely, completely,
Irrevocably serious?
Did he tell you the story about
How he was traumatized
by a Radcliffe girl
Taking off her shirt,
Suddenly revealing her largish breasts,
Which he never thought about before?
He tells that story all the time
To get sympathy and to justify himself,
As if he were the victim
Of female aggressiveness and duplicity.
That wasn't true?
No, it was true. He was the victim
Of female aggressiveness and duplicity,
but so was everyone else.
Not everyone then went on a rampage
Exploiting the opposite sex.
He thinks his problem is just
that he falls in love a lot.
Well, a lot of people
fall in love a lot.
I'm really surprised
you'd be taken in by him.
You should notice I didn't
answer your original question.
My original question,
Whether you were
absolutely committed to des,
You didn't answer?
What does "loon" mean?
Des calls me that.
I sort of like it.
It's, uh, short for "lunatic"
And also the lake bird
with the eerie call.
It's the other terms
Des uses for me...
"Nutcase,"
"freakazoid," etcetera...
I kind of mind.
A lot of people like to say
They won't take "no" for an answer.
I just wanted you to know
I'm not one of them.
I can be easily discouraged.
I will take "no" for an answer.
Ok.
No.
You don't mean that.
No.
I'm sorry.
She's not in right now.
Ok. I'll have her call
you back. Thank you.
Alice, sorry.
What?
You better see bob.
Bob wants to see you right away.
It's something bad?
The author of your
Tibet book doesn't exist.
He's a fraud.
Carol thinks it could be worse
Than the Clifford Irving case.
Carol thinks it's as bad
as the Clifford Irving case.
Turns out the author isn't
the Dalai lama's brother,
but a Los Ángeles writer
named John Disimio.
It's a shame. This
is a really good book.
Dan thinks it's one of the best things
Ever written on Tibetan Buddhism.
What a mess.
I'm sorry I haven't been more of a help.
I've been a little preoccupied myself.
I'm late for my period.
How late?
A day.
A day late, and you're worried?
I'm sure I'm pregnant.
But isn't that what you wanted?
What do you mean?
Well, I thought you said
You wanted to have
Jimmy Steinway's babies.
Yeah, but not this way.
I'm not an addict.
I'm a habitual user.
I'm sick of you and that nut case
Going around judging everybody.
"Oh, he's an addict."
"Oh, he's basically honorable
Except for his treatment of women."
I am not a womanizer.
In fact, I hate womanizers.
In any case, Alice
completely changed all that.
Isn't that a little morbid?
Morbid?
Why take on all that baggage?
Isn't he a bit of a sicko?
From the start, you know he's defective.
Usually you don't find that out
Until much later.
And what if you have kids?
It can be hereditary.
One thing about Jimmy:
I know he'll make a good father.
There's always some
problem, some baggage.
Oh, my god, you're serious.
Well, not necessarily.
Coming.
Tonight I'm gonna tell Jimmy.
Wish me luck.
You know, I think my father could have
Been an undiagnosed manic-Depressive.
Hi. Uh, do you know josh
is downstairs waiting?
Yeah. Thanks.
Bye.
Bye. Bye.
Alice is so great.
I've gotta be a better friend to her.
Yeah.
Before leaving the D.A.'s office,
I'd like at least once the chance to use
The expression, "book this clown!"
Heh. I thought only police said that.
No, I think an a.D.A. Could,
In certain circumstances,
Perhaps not very typical.
Are you aware
All your clothes are slightly big?
I'm still waiting for my growing spurt.
Both my father and
brother are over 6'3".
You can still grow in your twenties.
There are cases on record.
Tall people tend to
have great personalities,
This kind, compassionate comprehension
Of the rest of the worid.
My father and brother are both that way.
What's wrong?
Just remembering something.
What?
It's kind of maudlin.
It was here
My depression first descended.
Oh.
"To the valiant seamen
"Who perished in the Maine
By fate unwarned, in death unafraid."
Isn't this the strangest,
Most forlorn monument?
Yeah, it's very sad.
What happened with your depression?
Nothing at first.
I just went back to
Cambridge very depressed.
Then there was the incident
at the hayes-Bickford,
After which I was taken to
mass. Mental for observation.
While there, I cut my hand
trying to open a stuck window,
And they put me on a suicide watch,
Though I don't think I
was ever really suicidal,
At least no more than a
lot of people that age.
But you're ok now?
Uh...
yeah.
Actually, a lot of people
spend considerable sums of money
To get the high I get
absolutely naturally.
Now, with lithium,
Which is, in fact, a
naturally occurring salt,
I can stay on a perfectly even keel,
Perhaps too even.
Did they prescribe lithium right away?
Lithium wasn't so standard then.
There was a lot of muddling
through various therapies.
Because my right hand was bandaged,
I used my left to write friends cards,
Which was a mistake.
My handwriting looked weird
and really scared people.
I... I don't think
I was ever that...
that badly off, but
others might disagree.
Do you know the words
To the hymn dear lord
and father of mankind?
While I was in the hospital,
it became a sort of mantra.

No, nothing happened.
We were just talking.
About what?
Charlotte said she

She wanted to talk to me about,
but before we got to
that, her period started.
Afterwards, I mentioned
that it might be a good time
To start thinking about
Whether we were really
right for one another
Or we should start thinking about,
You know, breaking up.
Josh hasn't called since that night.
Of course he hasn't.
What do you mean?
Oh, come on. You told me.
He sang a hymn or something.
You were totally weirded out.
I can't believe how intolerant you are.

That aren't that that-Bad.
First, some guy who's
already been around a lot
And almost certainly has it anyway,
So it'd be no problem
And, in fact, would give
you something in common.
The other would be some guy
So idealistic and in love with you
That he'd want to commit himself to you
Prior to that step
because his dream would be
To be with you forever,
always, exclusively anyway.

infatuated with you then?
I assumed you preferred Tom.
Also, you seemed a little...

How was I irritating?
Well...
you weren't.

Getting infatuated
with me again, is there?
Just had to confirm that.
Let me keep your passport for you.
No.

To steal from each
other and the government,
And out of selfishness or indifference
Or a kind of fashionable cynicism,

Leaving town with your
girlfriend in the hospital?
It might look that way.
But it isn't?
I've been through this before.
After graduation,
Laurie and I were gonna break up,
but the same day,
She came down with terrible back spasms.
I hung around the hospital all summer,
And I almost bankrupted her parents.
And as soon as I left
town, she recovered.
By going away and putting
an ocean between us...
I.E., making a
definitive break...
Charlotte's likely to
recover much faster.
What makes you think
putting an ocean between you
Necessarily means a definitive break?
That's a depressing thought.

It's premised on the idea
That "thine own self"
is something pretty good,
Being true to which is commendable,
but what if "thine own
self" is not so good?
What if it's pretty bad?
Wouldn't it be better in that case
Not to be true to thine own self?
See? That's my situation.
The one I like is, "et tu, brute."
There are different ways of being loyal.
Some may seem on the surface disloyal,
but they're not.
There's a higher loyalty.
The way I see it,
Brutus was a good friend to Caesar.
By stabbing him in the back,
Brutus was a good friend to Caesar?
You know, I probably should
have stayed and testified.
Josh is right.
Bernie is a bad guy,
probably worse than they know.
That's what van thinks.
Van's cooperating.
Staying and cooperating would
have been the right thing to do,
but instead I'm running like a rat
Because to thine own self be true.
They say I can probably
go home tomorrow.
Great.
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.
Do you think Jimmy's
going away could have
Had anything to do with him, you know...
having some sort
Of bizarre, pathetic crush on you?
I don't know.
Well, did he ever say anything?
Yes.
What?
Well,
he...
"Why don't you love me
Instead of jerks like Des and josh?"
That kind of thing?
I knew it.
You bitch!
I knew it was something like that.
I don't think I want to
room with you anymore.
Being around you hasn't
been good for me or my back.
I'd like you to move out.
I don't know how I'll afford it,
but my sanity and my integrity
Are more important to me than money.
I have to start looking
out for myself now.
Have you heard the news?
No, what?
They're selling the company.
What?
We're merging with Simon & Schuster.
There'll be the usual consolidation
And economies of scale.
A lot of us are gonna lose our jobs.
God, that's sad.
I love the company.
They've been so great to us there.
Well, I don't know.
We were exploited,
but they were nice about it.
Maybe it'd be good if they got rid
Of some of the deadwood in that company,
Particularly if it meant
paying the rest of us
Decently enough to live in this city
With at least a modicum of privacy.
Why don't we do something?
Like what?
Well, at this time of day,
Employed people often have lunch.
I can't. I've gotta go uptown.
Why?
Alice and I are having lunch.
You're having lunch with Alice?
Great. Let's all go.
It's, uh, at Lutece.
You're on unemployment
And taking Alice to Lutece?
Um, doesn't irrational expenditures
Signal the start of a manic phase?
If it were my invitation,
you'd be right,
but it's not.
Alice is taking you to Lutece?
Why'd she take you?
Celebrating her promotion.
When Alice wants to celebrate something,
She calls you?
Alice made editor?
Associate editor.
Well, what happened with her book?
I thought it was some kind of fiasco.
What Alice did, rather cleverly,
Was shift the category
From nonfiction to self-Actualization.
The book jackets
hadn't been printed yet.
Reincarnation,
life after death...
Mumbo jumbo of all kinds
Has been highly commercial
Throughout the history
of book publishing.
The first printed book was the bible.
Actually, I'm not upset I was laid off.
This'll motivate me to get
a better job in television,
Which is where my interests truly lie.
I've watched television all my life.
If you're really
Interested in television,
You should come over and watch
Wild kingdom sometime.
Sure.
Are you taking the "e" train?
Yeah.
$2. Thanks.
Hey, van!
What happened?
Ah, the new owners
couldn't make it work.
Finally had to hire
people to stand outside,
Pretend that they couldn't get in.
Anyway, disco's over. It's dead.
What do you mean?
Well, people just aren't
going out like they used to.
They're tired.
Some are sick or strung out.
It's not just the prosecutions
And all the owners
that Bernie squealed on.
Could part of it be related
to the herpes epidemic?
Maybe. I've got a friend
At Casablanca records and tapes,
And she says that, like, 2 months ago,
The bottom dropped out
of all disco record sales.
Suddenly, it's...
dead, over.
God, that's sad.
We're getting older.
We've lived through
a period that's ended.
It's like dying a little bit.
Disco will never be over.
It will always live in
our minds and hearts.
Something like this, that was this big
And this important and this great,
Will never die.
Oh, for a few years, maybe many years,
It'll be considered
pass? And ridiculous.
It will be misrepresented
And caricatured and sneered at,
Or worse, completely ignored.
People will laugh about John Travolta,
Olivia newton-John,
white polyester suits
And platform shoes and going like this.
Though we had nothing
to do with those things
And still loved disco.
Those who didn't understand
will never understand.
Disco was much more and
much better than all that.
Disco was too great
And too much fun to be gone forever.
It's got to come back someday.
I just hope it will be
in our own lifetimes.
Sorry. I've got a job
interview this afternoon,
And I was trying to get revved up,
but most of what I said, I, uh, believe.
I was pretty furious when you had
My passport lifted, confiscated,
At the airport, but you were right.
I'm glad I stayed.
At least you saved me
From being stuck in some foreign city
With the likes of Jimmy Steinway.
But there's one thing I don't get.
You did a good job with the prosecution,
Getting Bernie to squeal that way.
Why'd they lay you off?
There was a conflict involving
Giving preferential
treatment to a friend
Which they felt I handled badly.
Oh.
Well, congratulate Alice for us.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
I don't envy her, though,
stuck in book publishing.
Oof. Yeah.
I've gotta get to
unemployment and sign up.
I'm going to Florida this afternoon.
So long.
Bye. Bye.
One of the things that
makes me happy in life
Is knowing that I don't envy anyone.
I don't want to be anybody else
Or do anything but what I'm doing,
Which, right now, is nothing,
but I have good projects for the future.
Can I speak honestly?
Yeah.
You and I are similar.
We both got big personalities.
That's good. The worid, frankly,
needs more big personalities.
But perhaps ours burn too brightly,
Are too big for people with normal,
Healthy-Size personalities like Alice
Or abnormal, healthy-Sized
personalities like josh
Or itsy-Bitsy,
teeny-Weeny,
Polka-Dot-Bikini-Size
personalities
Like Jimmy Steinway.
That's why I'm confident
I'll ultimately be
successful in television.
Absolutely. See, one of the problems
Of finding the right
person and settling down
Is it takes all the fun and interest
Out of going to nightclubs.
I mean, if you're already
living with somebody,
Why bother going out?
Getting seriously involved with someone
Really just means
ruining your nightlife.
What I mean to say is,
Jimmy, Alice, Josh...
so what?
That's what I say.
I think I agree with you.
