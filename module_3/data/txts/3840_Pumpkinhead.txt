When I Was Your Age,

That Pumpkinhead Was Gonna
Be Out After 'Em...
And That We Better Stay
Inside Till He Got 'Em.
- Pumpkinhead ?
- That'S What It'S Called.
<i>'Cause It Comes From
The Old Pumpkin Patch
Graveyard.</i>
- Do You Know Why
It'S After Us ?
- No, Ma'Am.
But You Must Have Done
Something Bad.
<i>According To The Legend,
If One Man Does Something Bad
To Another Man--</i>
It'S Gotta Be Something Real
Bad, Somethin' Like Killin'--
Then That Other Man Can Have
Pumpkinhead Conjured Up
To Take Revenge.
The Kid At The Stand.
What ?  What ?
There Was An Accident
Earlier.
One Of Our Friends Hit
A Little Boy With A Motorcycle.
<i>Where ?
At The Fruit Stand A Couple
Of Miles Down The Road.</i>
Gosh Almighty.
Billy Harley.
You Know ?
You Heard About It ?
[ Muttering ]
I Took His--
I Saw His Pa, Mr. Harley,
This Afternoon.
I Took Him Somewhere.
<i>Well, Was His Son Okay ?
I Can'T Say
For Sure.</i>
But If That Thing'S
Huntin' You, I Suppose Not.
Oh, My God.
- Your Friends,
Where Are They Now ?
- They'Re Dead.
<i>[ Wind Begins Increasing ]</i>
Do You Know The Spot
On Bradley Mountain
Where People Park Their Cars ?
- Yes.
- Can You Take Us There ?
<i>[ Wind Howling ]
Uh-Huh.
I Think It'S Here Now.</i>
- [ Roars ]
- Go !
Go On !  Move It !
<i>[ Wind Continues Howling ]</i>
Wallace !  Wallace !
Open Up !
Wallace, Open Up.
Wallace !
We Gotta Stop It !
We Gotta Stop It,
Or It'S Gonna Kill 'Em All !
Open Up Or I'Ll Blow The
Goddamn Thing Off The Hinges.
Lose It, Harley.
You Get Away From Here.
Get Away From Me
And My Kin.
This Way.

Stay Here !
[ Engine Revving]
Chris !
[ Roars ]
<i>[ Chris Screaming ]</i>
Chris.
Chris.
Come On.  Please.
Lady, You Gotta Get Up.
We Gotta Go.
Please.  We Can'T Stop It.
No One Can.
Somebody Can.
<i>Mr. Harley.
Come With Me.</i>
Mr. Harley, It'S Pumpkinhead.
It'S Real.
Now.
Come On.
Get In.
Get In The House.
Do You Wanna Live ?
You Okay ?
Yeah.
Thanks To You.
Well.
I'M Gonna Go Outside
And Talk To Mr. Harley.
I Want You To Stay Here.
Mr. Harley ?
Mr. Harley.
It Was An Accident.
He'S Dead.
Nobody Saw Him
Until It Was Too Late.
Can'T You Stop This ?
Can'T You Call It Off ?
Nothin' Can Call It Off.
But I'M Gonna Send It Back
To Whatever Hell It Come From.
Oh.
[ Whimpering ]
Oh, You Old Dog.
[ Growling ]
