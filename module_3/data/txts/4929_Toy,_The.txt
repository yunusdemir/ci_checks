THE TOY
- Mr. de Blenac, please.
- Do you have an appointment? - Yes.
- You are Mister...
- Perrin. Francois Perrin.
Mr. de Blenac, Mr. Francois Perrin is here.
A moment, please.
- Mr. de Blenac is expecting you.
- Thank you.
Please be seated.
Do you have much affection that beard?
Excuse me?
I advise you to shave. Mr.
Rambal-Cochet doesn't like beards.
Go shave it off and
come right back to me.
It may be a good journalist
can carry off a beard.
You should know that Mr. Rambal-Cochet
participates personally in the magazine.
I'm the editor-in-chief, but he
supervises everything. It's his hobby.
He comes here every day. Go, shave.
Aside from that, things
are pretty relaxed here.
I've been here from the outset...
for maybe 20 years...
Yeah, exactly 19 years and 5 months.
And you, what have you been doing?
I'm unemployed, for 17 months...
more precisely, 17 months and 6 days.
This is called forced labor.
To begin, you'll be only a number.
I take the photos, and you should
compose the original story.
A Business Breakfast in
Rambal-Cochet's factory.
The President Mr. Rambal-Cochet
congratulated his staff.
We're not going to get the
prize for best feature, friend.
The editor-in-chief, de
Blenac - what's he like?
De Blenac is a puppet.
You'll catch on pretty quick.
Ladies and gentlemen...
President Rambal-Cochet
is slightly delayed...
and requests that we start without him.
Grub's up!.
This isn't too bad, is it?
You haven't tried the pate, have some...
- Not with the salmon...
- Try it, it's stupendous!
Ladies and gentlemen - good
morning, please be seated.
Go on, please.
Take this, it's my pate.
No, it's not mine. It belongs to Mr....
I'm sorry, madam.
This son of one of the staff,
a cook or a gardener...
Rambal-Cochet has a message for him.
No, from Division # 327.
There's been a mistake...
Please.
However, it is nice...
It's hard to find work
for the deaf and dumb.
Then Mr. Rambal-Cochet is very friendly...
I have money troubles, you may be sure.
I would like to advance
something, do you think...?
A little, if and when it's not the
continuation of an earlier advance.
- Pignet.
- Perrin.
I call the bank every day. I'm in the red.
- Is it a huge bank or just a branch?
- A little branch, why?
Good, then invite one of
the managers for dinner.
It's what I do. You have
to learn to be convincing.
You explain that you're
expecting a large deposit soon...
then you tell a joke to get
the manager to laugh.
And the, that type of guy will say...
Doctor, yes...and your
feet, I also still want...
I know the same joke,
but with vetinarians.
Here's another, fine, fine, but truthful.
At the Cannes Film Festival, I reported...
and met in Croizet with movie stars.
I'm sorry, has it been
3 hours? I have to go.
- The bill, please.
- Yes, sir.
How can you break nuts
with the edge of your hand?
Operation Dragon.
I, I'm sorry...
That leaves no spots, so...
Let's cut to the chase, if it seems right.
Yes, of course.
Can you assure me that you're going
to pay by the end of the month?
Absolutely.
- Let's see, it's roughly six million or so?
- Yes...
Thanks.
It's very important.
This week I get it covered, at the
latest within the month, and I'll...
Don't even think of paying by check!
Pardon?
I don't want you to pay by check.
I instructed them not
to accept your checks.
But we've already agreed...
I'm sorry, but I prefer to be paid in cash.
But I don't carry cash.
Yesterday, I wanted to withdraw
200 francs from the bank
and they wouldn't let me.
OK, I'll pay.
No, it was me who invited you!
To invite with my money. How agreeable!
What can we share?
It's not your problem, friend, let it go.
- Is that your daughter?
- My wife.
A moment, Mr. President,
I've got to look for him.
Perrin isn't here?
- Perrin?
- Yes?
Come with me.
The President wants to see you.
Hurry, he's waiting for you.
Come in.
Be seated, please.
Mr. de Blenac told me
that he's happy with you.
Pleased to meet you.
Thank you, Mr. President.
We're going to sign your contract
at the beginning of the week.
You will become a member of the family.
I made a great effort so that the
magazine has become like a big family...
that's why I love it...
and so do the readers, too.
Mr. President, Master Eric on line 1.
Yes, dear boy? Is everything all right?
You're intelligent.
Good, tell me what you'd like...
Yes, OK. You can choose it yourself.
A kiss, dear boy. Until later.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, should I leave?
No, no, it's OK.
Thanks, Mr. Perrin.
Good bye, Mr. President...
...would be the price of
12 machines, which...
- Where's Nicole?
- Eh?
- Nicole.
- With Mr. Moravietti.
- What?
- With Mr. Moravietti.
- And where is Mr. Moravietti?
- Down the corridor to the right.
Hi, I'm Francois Perrin, the
husband of this young lady.
There's someone called Moravietti...
He's head of the service department,
and has been a burden for two years.
She cries every night.
Two years of nightmares,
and I've had enough of it.
I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Moravietti.
But this isn't Mr. Moravietti, he's
Mr. Robert, the subdirector.
Mr. Moravietti just left!
Any problems?
Anyway, I don't want to work.
But are you sure...?
I'll have a firm contract
next week, Nicole!
Mr. Rambal-Cochet
personally promised me!
Do you know who Rambal-Cochet
is? Can you believe it?
- Hello, Mr. President...
- Hello, Mr. Pignet.
De Blenac.
Yes, Mr. President.
Come at once.
Mr. President?
I've terminated your
contract with Mr. Pignet.
Pardon?
I've terminated your
contract with Mr. Pignet.
Very well, Mr. President.
Why, Mr. President?
He has a damp handshake.
What a load of crap? How should I
know I have a damp handshake?
I've never had a wet palm. You got that?
This can't be real.
I have resources, I'll go to the union.
In any other company, there
would be a strike, and you...
In your place, I'd take care.
If you were in his place,
you wouldn't lift a finger.
However, something could be done...
How about to return to unemployment?
Now's not the best time for the press.
It's in everyone's interest, not just mine.
GREAT TWO WEEKS OF TOYS
On the left, we have the
Japanese with robots,
electrical toys and machines
with remote controls.
On the right, we have Italian
and British products:....
cars, weapons, and small models.
And here - American toys,
with an authentic Indian.
You can photograph these, it's true.
He comes from the Sioux Reservation in
the Dakotas. Only a few are still in stock.
It's nice, eh?
Wasn't it the Sioux who rebelled
against the U.S. a few months ago?
Yes, yes.
Good. Bravo!
Bad Americans...bad!
Good Indians...good!
I am with you.
I go...for the visit.
Poor guy.
No, no, he's not unhappy
here. He charms the kiddies.
We invited them on Monday,
but we expect a lot of people.
Today, the shop is yours.
- Well, go to see by your side.
- OK.
- That.
- Zorro?
The Cosmonaut?
No, that one.
- The man?
- Yup!
No, no...we can't give
you him, my dear boy.
Why not?
Well...because...
it's a man!
We can't give you a man.
Why not?
Look, we're going to choose
the best toy in the store.
I want that one.
Yes, don't blame yourself, dear.
We already resolved this
- you can't have him!
Don't pull a nervous act.
Can you be patient for just a second?
Georges Puziet, manager
of the premises.
Do you work in Mr.
Rambal-Cochet's magazine?
And you know that...
this shop is also Mr. Rambal-Cochet's.
And?
His son...Rambal-Cochet's.
I don't know what you'll make of this...
but I want you to go with him.
Then the company will
handle it, and then...
you'll go back to the magazine.
- Him...is he sick or what?
- No, no, listen...
It's a very serious matter.
Mr. Rambal has ordered
me to please his son...
He's a very sensible lad.
I don't want to have a
nervous breakdown here.
Yeah, but I'm a journalist!
And I am the director of the shop,
and I want to stay that way.
Well, then?
A moment, dearest.
He's going to have a nervous breakdown!
No one would believe such
an absurd development!
And we'll be on a blacklist.
And why aren't you going?
He doesn't want me, he wants you!
He doesn't want the Indian?
OK...this is ridiculous, but in the end...
Great, thanks! This has saved us, buddy!
We're going - announce the good news.
It's solved, my dear boy.
The gentleman will go with you.
I'd like him crated up.
I'd like him crated up.
That's not possible, my dear boy.
You cannot put this gentleman in a...
Why not?
OK...well, because it isn't done...
Yes!
Well, I'll get back to work,
if you'll excuse me...
Listen to me!
You must follow the rules!
Don't be stupid, I tell you!
What?
I won't be useful in a box!
What's wrong with your head?
You'll see, it'll be very comfortable.
It's a synthetic with holes for breathing.
It'll be just as comfy as a chair...
You can't be serious!
And I want tape wrapped
around it! What I hope for is
a good night by the fireplace.
Do you prefer being unemployed?
We're going to do this, don't be
stupid. Tell yourself it's just a game...
a dramatization.
Master Eric's present has arrived.
Finish up your meal, Master Eric.
Master Eric!
You must finish lunch, Master Eric!
Help me.
We're going to be opening it soon.
You can't get up from the table.
Are you listening to me?
Return at once to the table, or it
won't be opened until tomorrow!
Eh? Oh, no!
What's going on here?
- She doesn't want me
to open my present.
- How come?
Have you been naughty?
I'm sorry, but I'd rather leave here.
- What's that?
- My present.
Look for a couple of tools.
Step on it!
Who is it?
Francois Perrin, Mr. President.
I'm one of your journalists.
- What's the meaning of this?
- Nothing, he's my present.
I was doing a feature at the shop, and
your son wanted to bring me here.
Let's go, let's finish dinner.
What are you waiting for?
- What's your name again?
- Perrin. Francois Perrin.
Oh, yes, excellent!
Well, Mr. Perrin, I'm pleased to see
that my son has a sense of humor.
He's been well-behaved recently
- I was planning to reward him.
He's pulled off a good joke.
Let's put an end to this minor
farce, and you can go home.
I'll ask the editor to give you a
small bonus for this little stunt.
Don't bother, Mr. President. Excuse me...
He's a child. It's understood
that they like a bit of fun.
I enjoy kids...excuse me...
I told this gentleman that I'm happy
my son has a sense of humor.
And now that we've all had our
little laugh, he can go home.
Let's go, my dear boy, say
thank you and goodbye.
He's mine and I want him.
Come with me.
You'll live here a few days -
I hope that's not a problem?
I'll tell the editor-in-chief that
you're working on some stories.
I'll make sure you're well taken care of.
See my secretary to settle the details.
But this is totally nuts!
Do you want to leave?
I'm going to send you to my secretary.
Hello, sir. I'm Mr. Rambal-Cochet's
personal assistant.
So...you need pyjamas, hygienic items...
Do you use an electric razor?
- De Blenac?
- Yes.
- I'm calling from the
Rambal-Cochets' house.
- Yes, I know.
Good, then listen well:...
Tell Mr. Rambal-Cochet that the
joke has gone on long enough.
My place is in the editorial
office, not in his son's playroom.
I'm a professional journalist. I've been
working in the press for 15 years.
I'm not accustomed to
being treated like a toy.
Everything will be OK, relax!
I'll be there in a few minutes.
Promise me you won't run off.
- Promise?
- Yes, OK - but hurry!
- Are you coming?
- Where to?
To tour the house.
You'll need this.
Ready?
My room.
This is not the first time
that the Council of...
The office of my father.
Don't be scared.
That was his lunch, Dude.
It was your fault.
Pay the fine.
It's an accident, but
you have a part to play.
But I don't know anything!
It's easy, ask for their documents
and so on. Let's move it.
My license and my ID, Inspector.
Crossed in amber but
not in red, Inspector.
Very well.
Take this test for DUI.
Blow.
Blow!
Can I clean up the
dishes now, Master Eric?
- Yes, yes, we're going?
- Are you coming?
What are you up to?
I'm not done yet.
Their brightwork's dirty, sir.
No, play something else.
Look at this tire! Get out of the car.
- I said we'd play something else.
- Get out of the car!
By what right are you
using "'tu"' with me?
You addressed me that
way. I have witnesses!
Yes, you so addressed the inspector, sir.
Come with me!
I'm Eric Rambal-Cochet.
So what, keep moving!
- What's there?
- A cupboard, sir.
Good, let's go.
You're nuts! Let me go! Open up!
What's going on?
We're playing, Mr. President.
- You're crazy?!
- What's happening, Eric?
Nothing. We're playing.
Are you coming?
Good, Julien.
Be careful!
- What's your name
- Francois.
No, your name's Julien.
You're my friend, Julien.
How long do I have to be here?
I have a wife who's
expecting me, you got that?
I have a profession. A proper life.
What am I doing here?
- You want to play?
- I asked you a question.
Every time I score a goal,
you get an extra year.
Right, let's begin.
And if I win?
You can go.
You know, I played
pretty well in my youth.
Let's see.
One year.
I wasn't ready.
Two years.
Are you playing?
How many are there here?
- I'm sorry?
- How many employees are there?
14, sir.
If you have to look hard,
will the others come?
We'll be able to have a huge party, right?
Well, be that as it may, I'm still finishing.
Come on, let's go!
2-0.
2-1.
2-2.
3-2.
Are you deserting?
You play very well.
Then I won.
Why can't I go, then?
Don't get fooled, Julien
- you're well-off here!
Dad will give you a big heap of cash.
Where are you going?
- I'm lost!
- Stay or I holler for my Dad.
I don't believe you.
Damned spoiled rich kid -
you should get a good beating.
That's not why you were sent here.
- You think?
- Just try it.
- Are you happy, my dear boy?
- Yes, very.
We played football, now we're
going to play ping-pong.
No, I think it's time to go riding.
Go change your clothes.
I'll wait down there.
Do we bury the hatchet?
What do you need from me?
- We'll go together.
- What?
We'll go together.
But I can't do this!
I've never been on a horse.
What's this?
Your riding gear.
Perrin, This is de Blenac. I'm late
with the magazine. I'm very sorry.
Oh, sure. Now that you want
to get up on horseback...
The kid. You want me to ride a
horse, and to see me act the clown.
We must put an end to this
atrocity, do you hear me?
Hang on, Perrin, don't
get pissed, calm down.
You'll receive a humongous surprise.
Courage - it'll be worth it, believe me!
I already warned your son that
I don't know how to mount...
Or dismount, for that matter.
Good, they'll go without me.
Penny for your thoughts.
Is something wrong?
- My wristband!...I've lost my wristband!
- Stop!
- Right, are you happy now?
- Forward.
Are you out of your mind?
You were right. He fell.
I've been dismissed, friends.
Why?
I don't know. Dismissed...
Maybe because I was
in the shop with Perrin?
I have no idea.
So I've have been chucked out, too.
Oh, it was just a small bump.
I took the liberty of phoning your wife.
I told her you're doing a story
and not to wait up for you.
Here's the surprise he mentioned...
Your contract.
The President was to
finalize it next week.
But now he seems likely
to fix it right now...
to compensate you for
the inconveniences.
And a bonus check.
Look at the zeros! Look!
As I see it, this is a grand
gesture of esteem, right?
Well, I'll leave you - I should go.
Goodbye and good luck!
Your wife will go mad with joy!
De Blenac.
Buying a journalist as a toy...
that seems normal to you?
There's probably 2,000 people
looking for work in the press.
- Take this?
- What is it?
Open it!
Sorry for what the horse did...
I bought it myself. Nice, huh?
Yes, it's nice.
- Your bath is ready, Master Eric.
- We don't take a bath together?
You're much to big to take a bath
with someone else, Master Eric.
And go on.
He's coming with me.
- It's already beginning...
- I'm looking for his father...
We'll have a naval battle.
Listen, Master Eric, I'm
looking for your father...
Leave me alone.
Why are you staying here with me?
Is it very hard to find
work as a governess?
Where's the bathroom?
- You're not going to take a bath with...
- It's right here.
Master Eric, I ask you, please...
No one can come into the bath room...
Master Eric!
Which end do you want?
It's a joke - I won't
take a bath with you.
- Oh, good - Just wait in the
room - it's a joke, I tell you.
It's not a joke.
Well done, Julien, bravo!
Pleased to meet you, Julien.
Hi.
Ma'am...
Is everything alright?
- Do you like our house?
- I have no choice.
Sorry...
Go on, blot it dry. It might not stain...
Take it.
Wait!
Let's go!
Your dinner, sir...
- What about the monster?
- Excuse me?
- Is the little monster asleep?
- I don't know, sir.
Do you really like that beard?
Mr. Rambal-Cochet has
a loathing for beards.
Well, his wife will be delirious with joy.
Our magazine is a big family, Mr. Perrin.
That's why I love it
and so do the readers.
Oh, shit!
Did I startle you?
You're funny when you play by yourself.
You have no luck with food.
Are you pissed off?
No, I'm fine.
Yes, you're pissed.
Take this, it's good.
It's very good, I tell you.
What are you waiting for?
It's bed time, Master Eric.
Your dad's waiting to give you a kiss.
Do you want to come say good night?
I'll wait for you, OK?
- Good night.
- Ma'am.
- Are you looking for something?
- The...uh...the bathroom.
Come along, I'll show you.
I want to talk with your husband,
I can't really do much else here.
I want to go home.
I'm working on that -
you'll be home soon.
Here it is.
Thanks, you've been very kind.
You're the only sensible person
I've found in the whole house.
This is the gentleman
the child bought at noon.
Excuse me a moment.
Sir, please.
- My suit.
- I'm sorry?
- My suit.
- It's in the laundry, sir.
- Go look for it.
- But it's not dry, sir.
Bring me my clothing!
What's going on?
You can't treat people like this! It can't
be done. I'm voiding the contract.
Give it to your father. I've
gone crazy since I arrived!
You stay here! I bought you in
the shop! You belong to me!
They're not bringing you that suit.
Who's there?
Weren't you doing stories?
Are you hurt?
What's with the pyjamas?
A story of lunatics, you see.
De Blenac? I want to see him at once.
I said right now!
Everything will turn out OK, my dear.
You did everything right.
I'm sure it'll be fine.
I'm not very popular in Rambal-Cochet's
home just at the moment.
What's going on?
- Who is it?
- De Blenac.
I have to talk with you. May I come in?
There's no point, there's
nothing to be said.
I apologize for hassling you, but...
President Rambal-Cochet
asked me to come see you.
He asks that this wait until
another time. He'll expect you.
Tell him he's crazy and just as
spoiled as his son. Good evening.
He's a poor kid.
A poor child?
He's the son of his first marriage.
He lives with his father only
for one month each year.
That explains the indulgences
of President Rambal-Cochet.
The boy will return to his
mother within the week.
You could try, just a little.
It won't be for long.
A week...
After I took sleeping pills,
I went to sleep and then...
he woke me up...
Good night, Perrin. Good luck.
De Blenac!
Come along.
We're going to do something.
You see, he's back already.
Turn in now.
Sleep well, Julien.
You can't come in here, sir.
- I have to talk with Mr. Perrin.
- Who?
Perrin, Francois Perrin.
There's no Mr. Perrin here.
Yes, yesterday he was
brought here in a box...
Oh, yes. Just a moment.
Is everything OK?
Poor...
Thanks for coming to see me.
Do you know I got fired on your account?
You're joking, right?
It's no joke. Drop by any time.
- Who are they?
- The folks from "'Le Syndicat"'.
They want to disrupt
Rambal-Cochet's feast.
Let's go, come along with us.
There's nothing to be done here.
What do you think, that they'll
take you back at the magazine?
Get changed, let's go.
Hands up, Julien!
Start praying.
Give me a chance, Jim!
- Fine, agreed.
- Perrin...
We're meeting up on the
main street in a few minutes.
- The sooner the better.
- See you, Julien.
Perrin, for God's sake!
One second.
Sorry.
Be careful, Mr. Perrin.
It's to entertain your son, Mr. President.
After all this, you're still
making me come back, right?
Then I can leave if you want.
Thank you, ma'am.
Stop messing around. Perrin!
Enough bull, you got that?!
You play dead well, agreed?
Here they are, Perrin.
Can you give us a
moment, Mr. President?
- If the police arrive late...
- Dance...!
- Pardon?
- Dance!
Let's go. Come with us.
You coming, Julien?
Indians! Out of here!
For our liberty!
No to the firings!
Indians!...Here come the Indians!
Eric!
Indians! Sound the alarm!
Put all the carts in a circle!
Abandon the caravan!
It's the cavalry!
They always arrive just in time!
Find something else to do.
Hang on - give me a second.
Do you know how it feels
standing among a bunch of
strangers in your pyjamas?
I'll show you!
Let's make a magazine.
I'll teach you journalism. It's easy.
We'll start with the accident.
The train jumped its tracks...
I'm the editor in chief...
and I call you to my office.
Hi, Coco.
I've named you Coco because
everyone's named Coco in journalism.
There's been a serious train
wreck in the USA, Coco.
You investigate it.
Not in the USA.
Not in the USA, this happened in France.
How come?
Dad says the readers are
only interested in France.
You know nothing, I'm
going to be the editor.
I'm listening.
We need a title - I propose...
"'Serious train wreck in Lyon, 80 victims."'
- I don't like this train wreck
- Why not?
I don't like it.
"'The Paris-Lyon express
derailed. 80 victims."'
That's the headline.
I've been a pro journalist for 15 years. I
think I know the style of headline writers.
If you had style, you'd be
the editor instead of me.
Quit calling me Coco.
Don't blame yourself, Julien.
You're not playing anymore?
Look at this.
It's fun working on a magazine.
You get to interview people,
to learn about their lives.
We're going to call the
President, for example.
He'll be a very rich guy - very strong.
He could buy anything with his money.
We'll talk about all the President's
adventures from one day to the next.
Isn't that fun?
He'll have a family.
His wife will be very
much younger than him.
He'll have a son, who detests her...
because she replaced his mother.
And the boy, knowing that his
father had bought this new wife...
might do the same to
him, as a punishment.
One day he bought a man in a shop.
This will make your magazine.
This will do.
Let's go.
- You don't know the owner?
- No!
- Was his demeanor casual?
- Yes, yes.
Sir, ma'am, hello. I'm Rambal-Cochet.
Pardon the interruption - I
have to ask you something.
Sir...
Go on, please.
- How much would your house cost?
- It's not for sale, sir.
I didn't ask if it were for sale, I
just want to know what it's worth.
I don't know. I've paid
60 million over five years.
Now it's probably worth 80 or 90.
I'll give you 200.
Is this a joke?
200 million is apparently a good price.
Three.
How's that?
300 million, if you leave this instant.
I don't understand.
Stuff the suitcases and head off.
But this is impossible!
You've got one minute to think it over.
Well, can you leave the
house for a minute?
Right now.
Take it or leave it, you have 30 seconds.
Good...
Very well, I'll get ready...
Good...Let's go.
A letter from your son, Mr. President.
From my son?
"'THE TOY"'. Editor in
Chief: Eric Rambal-Cochet.
Reporter: Francois Perrin.
Thank you, Miss.
"'How does President Rambal-Cochet
acquire his properties? "'
- Where's Eric?
- He's gone out, sir.
- Where to?
- I have no idea, they left together.
Let me know when they get back.
I'll ruin you. You'll be smeared for life!
Hey, Pignet.
- What's the meaning of this?
- Don't worry, it's a survey.
What survey?
A new survey. For a new magazine.
The title is magnificent: "'The Toys
of President Rambal-Cochet"'.
- What?
- It's a free-sheet. Great, huh?
May I present the editor-in-chief,
Eric Rambal-Cochet.
Oh, Rambal-Cochet?
Let's go. Thanks, Pignet. See you around.
The truth is he does
have a damp handshake.
He sent me to get shaved...
I responded that many good
engineers have beards.
And I refused.
And you couldn't find a job?
No, nothing.
I'm going to my mom at
the end of the month.
We've got a big house.
With a swimming pool
where you can bathe.
Are you free just now, Mr. President?
No. Not now.
Do you want me to be the goalkeeper?
Let's go!
You have to come with me.
Don't worry about me.
If you call me, I'll come...
You'll call me, Francois?
You don't call me Julien anymore?
I have to talk with you.
Leave us alone for a moment, please.
You're waiting for me?
Wait in my room.
You're a very good journalist, Mr. Perrin.
I have a good
editor-in-chief, Mr. President.
What is it that you want, exactly?
Nothing, Mr. President.
Well, then, why this
ridiculous provocation?
I'll explain.
Back when I was an
employee, Mr. President...
I didn't have the right to express myself,
I censored myself, and I was scared.
Now I don't have to answer to anybody.
I'm a toy.
So now I can speak.
I wonder what's the point, maybe
I should go back to the magazine.
I need a bunch of information and I
know now that you're just the right man.
I'm a simple man - what
do you think, Mr. Perrin?
Hello, Paul, how's things?
Sir, I'm not Paul, I'm Lucien.
I'm Paul, sir.
Yes, of course. Then, Paul, how is your
daughter's heart trouble, improving?
I have a son, sir. It's Lucien
who has a daughter...
Good - is she better?
Yes, she's better. It was the mumps, sir.
These shrubs aren't lined up right.
I need a chief information officer. But it
should be someone prudent, Mr. Perrin.
I advise you to play something
else, something more prudent.
"'The Toys of the President:
6000 employees - 6000 toys."'
Well?
He was very polite.
I hear you're a good
journalist....very good.
Are you offered work?
In fact, he offered me a bribe.
If I drop this, I'll be appointed
head of information.
- So it goes, my little comrade.
- Let's stop it.
Yes, we cancel, that's much better.
You can go home if you want, Francois.
"'The Toys of the President:
6000 employees - 6000 toys."'
It's a pity, it was a good magazine.
- Is there a copier?
- What?
There's a photocopier in
the house, isn't there?
Foucault!
If I see another copy of this foolishness,
you'll have to deal with me, understood?
Good day, de Blenac.
Good day, Foucault.
- Mr. President...
- What?
There were 50 copies
distributed this morning.
Like this. Francois Perrin
and...and your son.
The whole world's got
a copy, Mr. President...
What's going on here?
Why aren't you working?
I want to see all the copies
which were produced.
Very well, Mr. President, right away.
Come in!
Here, Mr. President: the
dance of the Greek princess...
There was all the rage.
An interview with Claude Francois.
He appears at his moment
of triumph at the Olympia.
There's a new naturist club here.
It opened for Paris.
I believe this will titillate our readers.
Leave it, I can see for myself.
Very good, Mr. President.
Do you consider this
exhibition of meat tasteful?
Naturism is recently much in vogue.
That was the original club -
Knoll's furniture, choice,
the high quality and...
Get undressed.
Get undressed.
The whole editorial staff will be naked.
We'll have a chance
to evaluate its impact.
Mr. President, I...
I told you to strip.
What are you up to, de Blenac?
I'm getting undressed, Mr. President.
If you don't stop, you'll be
naked and in everybody's mind.
I didn't ask for this, Mr. President.
I'm going to ask an important
question, de Blenac.
Which of the two of us is the monster?
What I'm asking you to do is take
off your pants and flash your butt.
I don't know, sir...
The whole problem is here, I believe.
You can go, Mr. Perrin.
You're no longer needed.
I will explain to my son.
He'll understand it well enough.
He surely knows now what
kind of person you are.
This has caused resentment.
He knew that from the
moment you arrived here.
You think only of the
expansion of his world.
You don't get it yet, Mr. Perrin.
You're free.
I wanted to give your son
a chance, Mr. President.
The worst of it is that he
could become like you.
Yet that can still be avoided.
I will control you, Mr. Perrin.
I was a present for him, you understand.
I can't tell him goodbye?
It's not necessary.
This is called "'Jet Stream"', it's not
for the pool, but for the ocean.
You can swim either with
or against the current...
you see, it's very strong.
Your mother told me that the
installation is almost completed.
It'll be even more difficult to
dry off from swimming now.
Call me as soon as you
arrive, don't forget.
Your departure has been
moved up by eight days.
I'd like us to go the US, to
Disneyworld, for example.
That's not a bad idea, eh?
- Hi, Moro.
- Mr. President. How's things, Eric?
Perrin? This is Rambal-Cochet, Eric has run off.
We're sure he went to your house.
I'm on the way.
You got the readies for
a cab? I'm flat broke.
Your father's on the way here.
Don't sweat it.
We'll still be together and
we'll continue the magazine.
No, it's not a game anymore.
What did I say? No more
playing. You go with your father.
- I want to be with you.
- This is impossible.
- Why not?
- Because you've got a family.
A father, a mother - they love you.
You've grown since the
incident with the jacket.
Are you listening? Leave me in peace!
No, I want to stay with you.
But I'm nobody!
I don't have a job, no money, nothing!
Even if your father calls, I can't.
I'm poor, do you understand?
He's here.
- What's going on? Are you crazy or what?
- I don't want to go with you!
If you wouldn't welcome
him, he wouldn't run off.
But until a time comes
when I have to, shit!
I told you I'm tired! Tired of
Rambal-Cochet, father and son!
Time flies - I've got to eat.
We're not going to play
another game. Beat it!
Thank you, Mr. Perrin, call me tomorrow
and I'll see what I can do for you.
Everything I do in my
life is for you, my love.
Everything I have is yours.
You're my only reason for going on,
you understand?
He's a poor type, just like one of millions.
He has nothing to offer you.
Nothing.
Think about what you'd
lose by being with him.
