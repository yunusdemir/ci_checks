If I had known how everything's gonna happen
﻿I would have done everything differently.
﻿I would have stayed invisible.
﻿A no one
﻿But Im no longer a nobody.
﻿I'm one of the most wanted hackers in the world
﻿Who am I?
﻿I am Benjamin.
﻿And this is my story
﻿He has learned his lesson
﻿He claims he's done with hacking
﻿He said he can lead us to Frl3nds and Russian cyber mafia
﻿He wants to talk only to you.
﻿And you are . whoami?
﻿There's a reason why you're here
﻿A reason I'm here for
So?
﻿Everything is somehow connected
﻿Everything that has a beginning has an end.
﻿It's a mix of all
﻿And I'm in the middle
I always wanted to be a superhero
﻿with a superpower
I wanted to do things that nobody thought possible
﻿In reality I already had a superpower
I was invisible.
﻿And I also had a superhero costume
﻿Paradise Pizza: the end of the rainbow
﻿Every superhero needs a tragic family story
﻿Spidermaris parents
﻿Dead.
﻿Batman's parents
﻿Killed.
﻿Superman's parents
﻿Exploded
﻿I actually had the best requirements
﻿My dad ran away to France when I was born
I have never met him
﻿A similarity that I share with my grandma
﻿Her father died in the Second World War
﻿The only memory she has from him
﻿are three bullet casings his comrades brought from foreign countries
﻿My mom took her own life when I was 8
﻿The best material for a hero story
﻿My grandma took care of me
﻿and later me of her.
﻿I'm not a psychologist.
﻿I don't care about your dreams
﻿What do you know about CLAY?
﻿About your alliance with the Frl3nds?
﻿Everything you want to know
﻿But every detail is important
﻿Hacking is like magic
﻿They re both about deceiving others
﻿Since I was 141 spent my time in front of the PC
﻿I've learned prgrammmg languages
﻿Hacked my first system.
﻿An universe of infinite possibilities.
﻿For the first time I had the feeling that I was good at something
﻿In real life I was a zero among ones.
﻿An outsider
﻿A loser
﻿A freak
﻿But on the Internet I felt a sense of belonging
A refuge for people like me.
﻿Everyone who wasted their time on the World-Wide-Web
﻿met here in the so-called "darknet"
﻿The Internet within the Internet
﻿Here I could be whoever I wanted
﻿I spent days and nights on the PC
﻿Then I slept in the real world
﻿But there was an antidote
﻿I had the idea from my biggest idol
﻿There are a lot of great hackers out there.
﻿There was only one true hero for me
﻿He called himself "MRX"
﻿He is from nowhere
﻿No one knew who he was
﻿He hacked into any system
﻿He was a real star
﻿One of his most famous jobs was a social network attack
﻿He didn't take anything or anyone seriously
﻿He was the superhero among all hackers.
﻿I wanted to be like him
﻿He had an exploit used to manipulate an online pharmacy
﻿to get Ritalin
﻿The hacker's watchman
﻿MRX had 3 rules
﻿3rd: Have fun in cyberspace and meatspace
﻿In other words, don't limit your fun, don't enjoy things only in the virtual world
﻿But the real reason I sit here now
﻿why everything happened this way
﻿is Marie.
﻿Hey! Just resting helps no one.
﻿Hope is the rainbow over the waterfall of our life
﻿Do you still want to pass the exam?
﻿Try learning
﻿Or do you hope someone will steal the exam's questions for you?
﻿I called Superman but he had no time
﻿Retard'
﻿What kind of weirdo bird are you?
﻿Paradise Pizza
﻿The end of the rain
﻿-bow
﻿During the schooltime I was desperately in love with Marie
﻿But after ten years no one longer remembers the freak from the last row.
﻿That costs 34.28
I said without anchovy!
﻿I'm not paying for this!
﻿Don't be a jerk, Oscar1
﻿The rest is for you
﻿What? Are you crazy?
﻿Mr. Anchovy gives you a hundred more if you get the exam's questions.
﻿Bachelor of Laws
﻿The world doesn't need a saviour
﻿but everyday I hear people crying for one
﻿What?
﻿That's Superman's
﻿It's okay
﻿Thanks
﻿You're such a jerk!
﻿I finally wanted to be a superhero.
﻿Marie had a problem
﻿and I could solve it
I only had to get her the exam's questions
﻿She will remember me.
We will fall in love
﻿get married
﻿have kids
﻿be happy together
Bingo.
﻿The bachelor exam's questions were stored ﻿on the central server of the university
﻿All I needed was an approach
﻿It was way too easy.
﻿Most of the hackers only pass over
﻿They appear in the system without changing a thing
﻿others leave a hint
﻿and many take a souvenir
﻿I was Superman, Spiderman, Batman
﻿What are you doing there?
﻿I was an idiot
﻿No arrests, no previous conviction
﻿50 hours of community service
﻿Do something with your life!
It's up to you.
﻿My 50 hours of community service meant cleaning a city I didn't care about.
﻿It couldn't be any worse
﻿Not even the Ritalin worked anymore.
﻿But everything had to change in one fell swoop
﻿And? why are you here?
﻿Can't you speak or what?
﻿Then no...
﻿Let me guess
You're one of those guys who think that life is unfair for them
﻿who are feeling like only passing by
﻿invisible
﻿just like the rest of the society
﻿In the school you weren't even beaten up
because no-one gave a damn about you.
﻿That's all really really sad
﻿Do you know what I think?
﻿it's all just your scam.
﻿Computer stuff
﻿And you?
﻿This and that
﻿What kind of things? huh?
﻿DDoS attacks?
﻿Botnets?
﻿Phishing?
﻿Or are you just a script kiddie?
﻿I hacked the University's server.
﻿How did you manage to gain access?
﻿Using an 0 Day exploit.
﻿You know how to read machine language?
﻿Simple as that?
﻿I am Max.
﻿Benjamin.
﻿Any plans for today?
﻿I was keep wondering if there's a moment that pulls all strings together
﻿That moment that changes everything
﻿As later the evening as drunker get the guests
﻿How do you like my modest temple?
﻿I don't even know one half of the people
﻿All arse kissers.
﻿Max was the total opposite of me
﻿Self confident, charismatic
﻿A winner
﻿Close the door!
﻿Let me introduce you
﻿He's Benjamin
﻿Stefan
﻿Benjamin
﻿Benjamin Engel
﻿Stefan was the software master
He could find a bug in any application
﻿He was completely insane since forever
﻿He loved the thrill
﻿craziness
and so on
﻿No last name
﻿Paul was the hardware freak
Give him a paper clip and a motherboard and can build anything you want
﻿Like me, he lost his mother early
﻿His rich father left him at an orphanage
﻿to be able to focus on the important things.
﻿Don't worry! His smile muscles were removed at birth
﻿Max said that you can read machine language
﻿Machine language?
﻿Anyone can say that!
﻿It's not something that's easy to prove!
﻿Prove?
﻿Or you won't leave alive
﻿Angel
﻿Paul
﻿Benjamin
﻿Just Benjamin
﻿The fun begins now!
﻿Don't worry!
﻿We're not the swindlers
﻿What? Did you think that I live here?
﻿Come on!
﻿Come on! Go!
﻿Make way!
﻿You're the pizza bird!
Do you know each other?
﻿It's his party!
﻿What the fuck?
﻿No last name
﻿I always stopped at warnings
﻿never asked myself again after that
﻿I can't anymore
I can't go any further
See ya after!
Now i remember you!
﻿Benjamin! Benjamin Engel!
﻿Our teacher forgot about you
﻿and then you had to take the train back home!
﻿It was interesting...
﻿...the evening
Bye!
﻿Bye.
﻿We all knew that this day would come
﻿Your grandma needs professional help.
﻿You must let go!
She's in very good hands.
﻿My grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's 4 years ago
﻿Since then ifs like an invisible eraser deletes her borders.
﻿Tickets, please!
﻿I thought the cops had caught you!
﻿It wasn't a good idea in the very first week to close the exit
﻿What's wrong?
You'll feel better
Come on! I'll show you something!
﻿Come on!
﻿I should have stayed sitting there
﻿But it was like between us was an invisible rope.
﻿He told me how he started with hacking
﻿I was all ears
﻿There are people out there, they think they're safe
﻿They have no idea what’s going on
﻿Security. Everyone wants security
﻿Security doesn't exist!
﻿Once you understand this, you know
﻿it's like you have the world served on a plate.
You only have to get it!
﻿Even though we were so different, we had something in common
﻿First: Don't enjoy your actions only in the virtual world
﻿Second: aim for the impossible
﻿3rd: No system is safe
﻿MRX!
Never hide behind your computer
﻿MRX already knows this
﻿The main vulnerability isn't in applications or servers
﻿Man is the main security flaw
﻿You hack people?
﻿Exactly
﻿The most effective of all hacking methods, the great art of deceiving.
﻿Social engineering
﻿Man is by default trusting and confiding
﻿Social engineering uses these two components
﻿so that you can get anything you want
Passwords, secret information, login data
﻿Hungry?
﻿Hold this!
﻿How many chocodonuts do I get for this?
﻿It's a new sales pitch? huh?
﻿Pay for 10, get 8!
﻿For those with chocolate it wasn't available.
﻿What would I stand here for?
Who served this?
That blonde over there
﻿Come on! I'm hungry and got things to do!
There you go!
Have a good evening.
All good!
﻿You must be bold enough !
﻿Then the world is at your feet
﻿Oh! Already late!
﻿Are you ready?
﻿Come on let's go
﻿Where are we going?
﻿Come on!
﻿Go!
Why did you bring him?
﻿You don't know if we can trust him?
﻿You already saw what he can do
You can drive
﻿Don't make a big deal out of this! Well bring it back!
﻿Looking like this, you'll never get in
Why does he come?
﻿I thought I come with you!
﻿What are you up to?
﻿Not "you", we!
﻿Come on! Get dressed!
﻿Chop, Chop!
﻿This wasn't part of the plan!
﻿Let's go
﻿Good luck.
You not coming with us?
﻿I'd rather not!
﻿Let's go, my young boy!
﻿The identification card was a small simple piece of paper
﻿Five minutes of photoshop
﻿Two minutes for printing
﻿Any idiot could do that
﻿Identity card?
﻿Without dispatch!
﻿Fellow of the Danish Federation
﻿Without
﻿Without dispatch
﻿One of the guest speakers!
﻿Danish people s front!
﻿What has this to do with hacking?
﻿The presenter's laptop
﻿it must be connected to another wifi network
﻿This is your job!
﻿Don't forget! Aim for the impossible!
﻿Shit! Shit!
﻿Which?
﻿What other network?
﻿I don't trust the small one!
﻿You don't trust anyone not even yourself!
﻿Listen! They're sick of this!
﻿The Federal intelligence Service has people everywhere
﻿They're between us! OK?
﻿They have this kid that never said a lie
﻿I'm invisible!
﻿I'm invisible!
﻿You assholes!
Time for a bit of blasphemy!
﻿Dear fellows,
﻿we're presenting you now our new wallspot!
﻿A small flame that will bum in the German's hearts!
﻿Quiet!
﻿Cut! Cut!
﻿The lamers are coming!
﻿Stefan! the keys!
﻿I don't have them!
﻿That was our first job together
﻿The birth of something real big
﻿And I was a part of it.
﻿How do I know if what you're telling me, is for real?
﻿1?-04-?3 6212
﻿What did you say?
﻿Your insurance number
﻿Bom in Friedrich
﻿studied in Germany
﻿Graduated as the best of the year
﻿Investigator at the European Cybercrime Center in Hague
﻿Two bank accounts: one at Densk Bank
﻿other at the Holland Direct Bank
During the study period you had a problem.
﻿Since then you couldn't have kids anymore
﻿because of an uterus disease
﻿Your colleagues consider you cold
﻿I consider you lonely
﻿We needed a place for hacking
﻿My grandma's house was the perfect place
﻿This reminds me of the old times
﻿Having a computer crib or something
﻿1 million views!
﻿We need a name!
﻿We must become a brand! We must become famous!
﻿All the attention that generates is counterproductive.
﻿We re staying off the radar.
﻿Fuck the radar!
﻿Brand is awesome!
﻿Like Anonymous or Lizardsec!
﻿Like MRX!
﻿Are you all completely nuts?
﻿Max had an idea
﻿If Max had an idea, nothing could stop him
﻿I no longer do this shit with you
﻿Take the surprise from chocolate!
﻿Take it!
Sure, no problem
﻿I follow the polls!
﻿Who is “for"?
﻿We still need a name
﻿How about "CLAY" ?
﻿as in "Clowns laughing at you"
﻿because it's all about fun and because of the mask
﻿Nominated with 4 votes
﻿For CLAY
﻿CLAY'S next move was a small greeting to the financial world
﻿We had taken a liking to this
﻿Our next target was a big pharma company
﻿Max was right
﻿The bolder you were, the more you could achieve
﻿We hacked everything we got our hands on
﻿The Ritalin kept us awake
﻿We didn't take anything and anyone seriously.
﻿Who hides behind this mask?
﻿Is it a criminal organisation?
﻿or just a group of rebel teenagers?
What are you doing?
﻿Me? Nothing
﻿You?
﻿I'm looking for the man of the rainbow
﻿Marie? Are you coming?
﻿We must stop meeting in secret!
﻿and also leave our covers!
﻿You're such a fiasco!
﻿You...for you it's easy!
﻿You're...you're different! people  listen to you!
You're cool!
﻿Maybe you're right!
﻿When life gives you lemons, ask for salt and tequila.
﻿Max was marching on
﻿but his mood could change in seconds
﻿For weeks he tried to get from MRX a reaction about CLAY
﻿He wanted appreciation from his biggest idol
﻿We are fucking losers!
﻿But MRX didn't give a fuck about us
﻿Abroad there was another player
﻿Around this time she entered the game
﻿Now I call on Hanne Lindberg, lead cybercrime investigator of Europol
﻿Yesterday night, was a cyberattack on the European Central Bank of Frankfurt
We found out that the same hackers are involved
That are also behind the attacks on the German Army's servers
﻿they call themselves “Frl3nds".
﻿Frl3nds is part of the Russian cyber mafia
﻿they hacked in the past years many international targets.
﻿The group has 4 nicknames to locate
﻿3 of them are
﻿The last one is still unknown.
﻿The data they got was sold on that so-called "darknet"
﻿and consumed by the Russian cyber mafia
﻿According to our newest investigations, at least one of the Frl3nds
﻿members seems to operate from Berlin
Our commission joins Europol investigations
﻿Nobody knows the Frl3nds and their past actions better than Hanne Lindberg
﻿Is it true that you're tracking the Frl3nds for 3 years
﻿without success?
﻿Yes!
﻿OK. Any other questions?
﻿Good
﻿Hanne!
﻿I just wanted to say
﻿Glad to see you!
﻿I hope you don't have any problems with this
﻿No!
﻿No. I'm glad to work with you
﻿Good
﻿One more thing
﻿The fact that we were together, no one must know it
﻿People are talking. We must lose the information!
While she was hunting the Frl3nds, ﻿Max tried to get rid of the frustration caused by MRX
﻿Wanna take a ride?
﻿Max and Stefan borrowed one of Paul's toys
﻿and hacked the phone line of a prize competition radio
﻿They mtrerrupted all the lines but one
﻿so that Max could be put through.
﻿Hello!
﻿My name is Benjamin Engel.
﻿The correct answer is B: Ottmar Hitzfeld.
﻿Are you crazy?
﻿What has this to do with CLAY?
﻿What kind of fucking message is behind stealing a Porsche?
﻿It's not like that!
﻿It's not like a shitty Renault!
﻿Superheros need a superhero car!
﻿Exactly!
﻿Moreover it’s not stolen, i won it
Forget it
﻿Here!
﻿Excuse me, girls!
﻿We were a bit late!
﻿These guys are like Windows: it takes a while till they boot up.
﻿Cheers!
﻿You can be whoever you want!
﻿Check this out!
Be open minded!
﻿You achieved everything when you completed your ultimate challenge
﻿So can Benjamin,for example, he has a huge potential, but he doesn't use it!
﻿He hides behind the others. He doesn't open his mouth!
﻿If someone must always pull you
﻿then you'll never go far'
﻿Most of the people can only follow rules!
﻿It wasn't enough!
﻿Max was right. I had to finally change something
﻿I passed the exam!
﻿What are you up to now?
﻿Do you know how I made it?
﻿Nope
﻿I've intentionally answered wrong the questions
﻿Why?
﻿There are so many possibilities outside.
﻿I had the feeling that is not carved in stone that I pass the exam
﻿Like all the doors shut forever
﻿But now I've decided on a door
﻿Why are you driving a Porsche?
﻿I'm the employee of the month.
﻿Or maybe I'm also a superhero
﻿and this is my superhero car
﻿yeah...maybe
﻿Come on! believe in yourself!
﻿Be like Max
﻿Aim for the impossible!
﻿I d better go out
﻿It a nice Porsche
﻿Oh look who's here!
﻿The pizza bird!
﻿Get your hands off Marie!
﻿Nothing has changed
﻿Everything alright?
﻿Don't ask
﻿MRX sent a message!
﻿MRX hasn't mentioned a single word about CLAY
﻿until this moment
﻿In front of us we had the confidential cybercrime investigation ﻿document they sent to Europol
﻿It was a marked paragraph about CLAY
﻿The packet's purpose was only one
﻿He wanted make this clear to us
﻿CLAY in his eyes were no more...
﻿-than whining babies.
﻿We'll finish the fucker!
﻿Let's do an attack that tops all!
﻿We could hack a big bank!
﻿Yes! the money of a famous company!
﻿Bullshit!
﻿We need an attack on something real huge
﻿Something able to reach Mount Olympus!
﻿The Federal Intelligence Service
﻿What?
﻿BND!
﻿The king class
﻿The German Secret Service
﻿Bullshit! It's unhackable!
﻿No system is safe.
And aim for the impossible!
﻿The BND job must be the most complex we ever did
﻿Here you go, you pussy!
﻿With the right bait
﻿you can catch any fish.
﻿Without knowing, Gerdi granted us access.
﻿But from her system we still couldn't access the mam server
Gerdi was the jackpot, though
﻿Gerdi was responsible for the card cloning
﻿and for distribution of the entry-cards to BND.
﻿Accepted by password or address?
﻿It was the all time biggest breaking cliche.
﻿Idiots!
﻿Many tried to hack the BND before.
﻿But you can't do this only by hiding behind your desk
﻿Ready?
﻿Where's Benjamin?
No idea
﻿Where have you been?
We really made it.
﻿That was Mount Olympus
﻿We haven't just climbed it, we also put a flag on its peak.
﻿As for BND, the employees will get the next day the shock of their lives
﻿That was my night
﻿Leave me alone!
﻿Let us in!
﻿Don't act like a kid!
﻿And you like an asshole!
﻿You're nothing without us!
﻿A nobody!
﻿It's enough
﻿Nobody
﻿Nobody
﻿Without the others knowing it
﻿I stole secret data from the BND server
First he has manipulated the printers over the ﻿communication protocol
﻿then he bypassed the security firewall
and stole data
﻿Our unhackable system
﻿has been hacked in 2 minutes 23
﻿You're saying this like you were excited about it
﻿Whoever did this is a genius
﻿We should have had recordings
﻿They deleted all the video files and left something.
﻿But everything has a consequence.
﻿Every single fly flap.
This was found on his body.
﻿He was found in the woods
﻿Mauritz Lauer, better known as Krypton
﻿Morning!
﻿Get out!
﻿Get lost!
﻿What the fuck? you need us!
﻿What?
﻿I need you?
﻿Or maybe you need me!
﻿Do you know what?
﻿You're nothing! you're nothing more than a shitty impostor!
﻿All you can do is use people and manipulate them
﻿Stop!  Stop!
﻿Quiet
This morning was found the dead body of the hacker ﻿with the pseudonym "Krypton"
﻿His death and the German Secret Service hack last night
present the BND with something that might be ﻿the biggest scandal of its history
﻿Near to the dead body, was found the stolen data from BND,
﻿A secret employees list
﻿proving that Krypton worked for the BND
﻿It seems that Krypton belongs to the hackers group Frl3nds
﻿Financed by the BND to collect information about hackers
﻿At tins time, the hackers group CLAY ﻿seems responsible for the BND break-in
﻿You were the only one in the server room
﻿What did you do there?
﻿We said that we don't touch anything,﻿take anything and turn on only the printers!
﻿Did you leave any data?
﻿i've found a hidden partition on the BND server
﻿I have... I've cracked the password
﻿and then downloaded some kind of employees list
﻿I don't know
﻿I sent it to MRX.
﻿Are you crazy?
﻿I wanted to prove him!
﻿I wanted to prove you!
﻿You thought I'm a nobody!
﻿Sometimes we hold so tight a photograph we got from someone
﻿It was like I couldn't recognize myself anymore.
﻿Everyone sees what they want
﻿Suddenly, it was crystal clear
﻿MRX has sold the BND data to the Russian cyber mafia
﻿MRX belongs to the FrlBnds
﻿When he found out that Krytpon worked for the BND, he eliminated him!
﻿Now everyone thinks that we did it!
﻿It's his fault!
﻿Austrian product
﻿Krypton has been admitted to the government agency and was eliminated
﻿What has this to do with CLAY?
﻿I don't know
﻿We could fail
I received a call from Hague
﻿They wanted me to make an evaluation
﻿of you.
Your work
﻿i didn't know that your position wasn't stable
﻿Why didn't you tell me?
﻿Where are you going?
﻿To find some fun. This isn't fun anymore!
﻿Krypton is dead, Max, dead!
﻿And we'll get fucking blamed for all this scandal!
﻿Benjamin could hand himself over to the police
﻿and tell them how he built alone his shit CLAY<
So you will sacrifice one of us?
﻿You always wanted to run away
﻿I don't fuckin' care what you're doing, I'm out!
﻿Stefan! Wait'
﻿This is all my fault!
﻿I must find MRX!
﻿And then what?
﻿It's not about us! it's about MRX
﻿the frl3nds
﻿they are the target!
﻿Benjamin is right. Running away doesn't solve this
﻿There are so many tracks left there
﻿It's just a matter of time till they catch us!
﻿We deliver them MRX and the frl3nds and we'll become invisible again
﻿Exactly
﻿When I said "we" I didn't mean "you" too!
﻿Oh my god! what happened to you?
﻿What do you want?
﻿last night you suddenly disappeared and
﻿and I thought that.
﻿You came here for Max.
﻿Max? No!
It's better that you go now
﻿Are you building a bomb there or what?
﻿Anything else?
﻿What's wrong with you?
﻿You're completely weird
﻿Exactly
﻿That's all you can see, right?
﻿the freak weirdo
﻿Do you know what?
﻿I wish i had never met you!
﻿We had to find MRX
﻿I was the decoy
﻿We were so paranoid lately that we could use only public networks
﻿Oh!, Here you are!
﻿Come on fast!
﻿He tried to contact MRX
﻿His IP address is spoofed
﻿he uses 100 different servers in Europe
﻿He's changing his location every 3 seconds!
﻿I think i got something!
﻿The server he uses more often points to this IP address
﻿In Berlin
﻿Get as much information as you can, Katja.
﻿He gave me access to his private channel
﻿What are you waiting for?
﻿We're running out of time!
﻿I almost have it
﻿They're here!
﻿Did you get it?
﻿Let's get outta here!
﻿Now.
﻿We'll meet downstairs!
﻿I am suspended
﻿They're looking for someone else from Hague!
﻿I'm sorry
﻿What did MRX ask for?
﻿He wanted us to send a Trojan to the Europol system
﻿If someone has access to Europol, can track investigations
﻿An hack
﻿What was your plan?
﻿We wanted to know who is MRX
﻿His identity in exchange for our freedom
﻿We wanted to prove that he's behind the Krypton's death
﻿We wanted to disappear from the 1st position of the wanted list
﻿We only wanted to be...invisible again
﻿To get access to MRX's computer
﻿we had to reach deeply into our bag of tricks
﻿Stefan called this application "﻿the pregnant horse"
﻿It was a Trojan horse inside of a Trojan horse
﻿The second when MRX would log on to the Europol server using our backdoor
﻿we could be able to access his computer
﻿And MRX's mask would fall.
﻿Before that we had to destroy all the evidence
I want to apologize...
﻿for the blue-eyed
﻿like Marie
﻿You knew all the time what she means to me
﻿and you didn't give a fuck
﻿What can i say? I'm an asshole
﻿The statement is true
﻿I'm an impostor! I could never do what you can
﻿i'm just a fucking script kiddie
﻿I can't do more than copy/paste!
I don't even know how to program
﻿I didn't know that
﻿Do you like this?
﻿Love birds!
We were on the way to Hague
﻿to Europol
We had to get in the lion's cave
but the road was long.
﻿We tried several methods
﻿No success.
﻿Our old phishing methods
﻿IVe even tried to get in across the canal.
﻿It's the only entrance
﻿What are you doing there?
﻿A fucking nail!
﻿Take it out!
﻿We had to admit that it was impossible to entrer the Europol
﻿What are you looking at?
﻿It was my fault
﻿I've dragged us into this
﻿I also had to get us out
﻿Man is by default trustful and confiding
﻿Social engineering
﻿Come on! Believe in yourself!
﻿With Paul's box I could access a network
﻿and then a second one, in parallel, a so-called "evil twin"
If someone had logged in from one of the offices in that network
﻿I could access their laptop
﻿and then the server
﻿MRX gave us an access code to a darknet channel
﻿where we could find the instructions.
﻿I only had to give MRX the manipulated Trojan
As soon as he logged into the Europol server
﻿his mask would fall
﻿But MRX foiled our trick
﻿MRX won the game
﻿and I lost everything
﻿Max, Paul, Stefan
﻿they're all dead
﻿I want to be Benjamin again
﻿I want to be invisible again
﻿This is Anne! Call me as soon as you wake up!
﻿You must come here immediately!
﻿Finally no one else
﻿You came..
﻿Yeah, I came
﻿Max told me that someone hacked the University's server some months ago
﻿and stole the questions for the Bachelor exam
﻿and got caught
﻿You once said that
﻿you must find out who you are
﻿and that there are a lot of opportunities outside
﻿but you can be whoever you want
﻿you can be anything
﻿Do you understand?
﻿i can be the Federation!
﻿You're a weirdo!
Will you come with me?
﻿I already said that you're crazy!
﻿Where?
﻿Wherever you want
﻿Copenhagen?
You can go anywhere, and you want to go to Copenhagen?
﻿Why not?
﻿Yeah...
﻿Why not.
﻿What else do you know about me?
﻿Do you know that I'm suspended?
﻿You want to be invisible again
﻿but the frl3nds know who you are!
﻿You want a new identity
﻿you want in the witness protection program! that's all you always wanted!
﻿for this I give you MRX, the Frl3nds
﻿It's not that easy!
﻿The Federal Criminal Police Office will be successful
﻿politics and media, pleased
﻿You are rehabilitated
﻿Let's say I agree
﻿How will you get MRX??
﻿Using a magic trick
﻿There are holes in his story as big as the Death Star!
﻿He's nothing
﻿A no one!
He played with fire and got burned
﻿but he can lead us to MRX!
﻿If we have him we will also get the frl3nds!
﻿You're suspended
﻿The promise of the witness protection program must end
﻿I need you for this!
﻿How will this magic trick work?
﻿We will attack MRX's weakest point
his pride!
We got him!
﻿What's his real name?
﻿19 years old
﻿from New York
﻿You should be the last one too
﻿so that you're not alone
﻿That's from Superman!
﻿In a few hours, you're a freeman!
﻿New name, new city
﻿There are holes in his story as big as the Death Star!
﻿I want to ask you some questions
﻿Do you know this person?
﻿No.
﻿He said you were in the same class.
﻿The freak!
﻿Have you seen Benjamin lately?
﻿No.
﻿Excuse me.
﻿What's this all about?
﻿Benjamin is under the BKA's attention
﻿He declared that in the last months you met often
﻿We did what?
﻿He's completely crazy!
﻿I'd never like to meet such a guy!
﻿Thank you for having time for me
﻿It's about Engel
﻿Or better said “your angel"
﻿Benjamin?
﻿Do you know him?
﻿Since he was young
﻿I treated his mother
﻿What can you tell me about him?
﻿He's uncommunicative
﻿an outsider
﻿No wonder with his history
﻿His mother took her own life
﻿Benjamin has grown up in unclear circumstances
﻿His mother had an identity problem
﻿Schizophrenia?
multiple personality disorder
﻿She had many different personalities thinking they're all herself
﻿The medication kept her at bay.
﻿In the end she couldn't endure anymore
﻿Is it inheritable?
﻿Possibly.
﻿What is it caused by?
It can be caused by a predisposition to other substances
﻿Some medicines can make the symptoms even stronger
﻿There are several triggers
﻿Ritalin?
﻿Ritalin is one of them
﻿But what it's all about?
﻿is everything alright with Benjamin ?
﻿The laboratory results are here!
﻿Let me guess! The bullets are from the 2nd World War!
﻿Yes
﻿How did you get this wound?
﻿what did hurt you?
﻿Why did you have the car keys with you?
﻿It is supposed that Stefan has driven the car
﻿What did you tell me about Paul? about his mother?
﻿She died when he was young
﻿That's you!
﻿They're all you!
﻿No. They're dead!
﻿There are no dead bodies! No evidence!
﻿In any damn hotel in Hague!
﻿What you saw in the hotel room
﻿doesn't exist!
﻿You made them up in your imagination
﻿CLAY - that's you alone!
﻿You are Max
﻿What? Did you think that I live here?
﻿You are Stefan!
﻿You are Paul!
﻿Every job, it was you!
﻿Alone!
﻿I don't even know one half of the people!
﻿All arse kissers!
﻿We need a name!
﻿We must become a brand! we must become famous!
﻿All the attention that generates is counterproductive
﻿We're staying off the radar!
﻿Nothing off the radar! Brand is awesome!
﻿Like Anonymous or Lizardsec!
﻿Like MRX!
﻿Fucking nail!
﻿I'm not like my mom!
﻿I know who I am
﻿That means that our agreement
﻿disqualifies you for the witness protection program
﻿No! You said we have a deal
You will get a caution
﻿I get the witness protection program, that's what you said!
﻿I'm sorry!
﻿They killed Krypton
﻿I betrayed MRX. They'll find me!
﻿Do you understand?
﻿We had a deal! I get the witness protection program!
﻿That's what you promised me!
﻿I'm sorry
﻿You're sick!
﻿I'm not like my mom!
﻿I'm sorry!
﻿Fr13nds will kill me like they killed Krypton
﻿I want witness protection program
﻿You promised me!
﻿Congrats!
﻿The collaboration between the Europol and BKA (Federal Criminal Police Office)
﻿has been from the start a composite of efficiency, proffesionality and certain
﻿Responsible for this is Hanne Lindberg
an exceptional fighter against the cyber mafia
﻿The Internet is not a legal black hole
﻿its doors aren't invisible!
﻿Anyone can be traced
I asked them to bring you to the courthouse
I'm sorry for hacking you!
﻿It wasn't fair
﻿The witness protection program is literally a program
﻿You have 5 minutes
What will you tell them?
﻿That you're on the way to the courthouse
﻿Won't you be fired again?
﻿They wanted MRX, the fr13nds. You're a nobody to them!
﻿You're invisible to them
﻿Promise me that you're done with hacking
I promise!
﻿No magic tricks anymore
﻿Wait!
Just one more thing
﻿How did you make this trick?
﻿If you know how'it works, it's less deceiving
﻿Everyone sees what they wanna see
﻿Take care!
﻿She swallowed it hook, line, and sinker
﻿The greatest all time social engineering trick
﻿Not even the Europol knows now who you are.
﻿What name did you find?
﻿No name
﻿OK. Who am I?
﻿I'm Benjamin
﻿I'm a hacker
﻿and this is my story.
﻿Hacking is like magic
﻿They're both about deceiving others
﻿Where have you been?
﻿They have my computer!
﻿They know who I am
﻿We all gotta get out of here!
﻿What happened?
﻿I was at the Europol
﻿How did you get in there?
﻿I pretended to be one of the students from a group
﻿it doesn't fucking matter!
﻿The task., was a failure!
﻿They got...
﻿they have all my personal details!
﻿Everything!
﻿Do you understand?
﻿We gotta get outta here!
﻿Immediately!
﻿Come on! What are you waiting for?
﻿You're one of us
﻿We don't forsake you!
﻿Now what?
﻿No system is unhackable
excluded from the witness protection program are persons with psychological illnesses
﻿Once again
﻿Give her very detailed information
﻿this works only if you trust yourself
﻿And if she doesn't feel manipulated!
﻿You can do it!
﻿Only this is left
﻿Ready?
﻿We're all invisible!
﻿What if she checked?
﻿Don't worry!
﻿She has checked
﻿But she has what she wants
﻿No more magic tricks
