Zato-Ichi
Boy...
Bring me the walking stick of that Anma-san.
<i>(massage therapist, masseur)</i>
I'll pay you, if you do.
Go silently.
Good boy.
Shut up!
Beat it!
Go! Beat it!
Ichi!
You were fooled by an innocent child!
Even the Master of Iai-Swordsmanship...
Without this, you can't do anything, can you?
You bastard!
Ow...
You asshole!
Rest Area
Drink!
Have some. Drink now.
What are you doing?
Store Manager of Naruto-Ya!
Don't you recognize us?
You... Naruto-Ya family?
I am the daughter!
Here you are!
What do you want again?
I've paid for this month!
You haven't paid for today.
Now you must pay every day.
We won't be able to survive.
Shut the fuck up!
Shut up and pay.
Funahachi Oyabun-Boss days were much better.
Ginzo-Group makes our life real hell!
What did you say?!
You want to say more?!
Stop it, please!
It must be a very strange scene...
I guide a blind Anma-san, carrying my vegetables.
I wish I could see that!
Oume's House
You did me a big favor.
Drink some tea.
Thanks.
It's bit hot.
Thanks.
Without your help...
I couldn't bring them home.
Where are you sleeping tonight?
Well...
You are a stranger here, aren't you?
Yes...
You're welcome to stay.
Besides I live alone.
Well...
Don't get any ideas.
That's not what I meant.
Ow...
Is it too strong?
No, it's just perfect.
I don't think that town will last...
Ginzo and Oogi-Ya struck a deal.
They do whatever they want every day.
Really? You have such punks?
They bully farmers...
...and towners, too.
They demand money for protection every day.
If it keeps going like this...
The more we work, the poorer we get.
Is it common to pay for protection every day?
Of course not.
We were paying each month.
Each month to each day...
What a difference!
You can say that again.
Oww....
Are you all right?
We'll stay here for a while.
I'll work again as a Yojimbo-bodyguard.
Don't you worry about me.
Please don't do that kind of job.
One day I'll work for some Master.
Stop worrying.
Take some rest.
Hey, Master!
Yes!
Where is the old man?
He's sick in bed.
He won't come today.
You make him work too much.
I'm sorry.
You must take care of him more.
Yes.
Awful taste as always.
We can't buy good stuff...
Same old story for 10 years!
Excuse me but will you pass it to that guy?
I'm not your worker!
What a nerve!
Can't you take it by yourself?
I'm sorry.
Why don't you drink there?!
He always sits there alone.
Perhaps he doesn't like us...
No, he doesn't like you!
Not me but you!
Welcome...
Hey! Don't welcome me.
Where is this month's money?
This month...
Please, give me some time.
No! Who do you think you are!
How long must we wait!
Please bend some rules...
Please kindly ask your boss for mercy.
You serve bad sake?!
Shut up!
What do you want?
Send a message to your boss.
Capable Ronin looks for Yojimbo job.
O-samurai-san...
Oyabun Boss might not show up tonight.
Ronin-san...
Youre the one?
Wanting to be a Yojimbo-bodyguard?
Show me what you can do.
Magnificent swordsmanship, indeed!
I didn't cut the rope.
Look further down.
Anma-san, I'm off to the fields.
Tell me, lady...
Can I do something to help?
Thank you for your offer...
but I can't ask a blind man to chop wood.
Don't you worry.
You get some rest.
My dear...
You came back late last night.
Anything happened?
I found a good job.
As a Yojimbo again?
I beg you not to do it for me.
Please stop doing this kind of job.
Don't you worry about me.
With money, you may get well.
Hey...
You hired that Ronin?
Yes.
We have 2 problems to solve.
If we clean Izutsu-Ya and Funahachi Group,
the town will be totally yours, boss.
Don't be so harsh.
Yes.
We'll see to it.
By the way...
Do you have any news on the Heihachi murder?
It goes like this.
He was killed by a traveling Geisha.
That's what we know so far.
Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....
Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Ow...
Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....
Anma-san?
How about another helping?
No, thank you.
I've had enough.
Thanks again.
My lady... while I was cutting woods...
someone was running around the house.
What was he?
Him? That's Gohei's stupid son.
Don't mind him.
He wants to be a Samurai.
He runs like that every day.
He wants to be a Samurai!
Yes.
I'll be out for a while.
For work?
Not really...
Well...
For this.
What? You gamble?
Better stay away from that, Anma-san.
My nephew is addicted to gambling.
He doesn't work. And he gambles all day.
On top of it...
He vanished and no one knows where he is.
For me, it's a pleasure.
Before you know it,  you will develop
a gambling problem.
What do you think of this sword?
This sword cost me several hundred Ryos.
This is a magnificent sword!
I'll give it to Sakai-sama.
He will give us a favor,
when we have a trouble.
Sure.
That's right, Hikozo.
You test it on the beggar.
Eh? Me?
Yes, you!
Thank you, Master...
Master, you better do it.
If I test it, my kimono will be blood stained.
You do it!
Why don't you hire a Ronin to test it?
You fool!
What kind of a fool hires a Ronin to test a sword?
Do as I say!
But...
Someone's coming!
Slaughter that blind man.
But...
Do it fast!
What's the problem with a blind man?
My... sword!
I'm sorry!
Hwaahhh!
You fool!
I'm sorry.

Izutsu-Ya
Oogi-Ya's problems are over for now.
Welcome!
Give me Sake.
Yes, Sir.
Master!
May I have some sake, too?
Sure thing.
O-samurai-sama...
Anma-san, here it is.
Ahh! Your walking stick!
I'm awfully sorry.
What a beautiful walking stick!
Hey! Anma!
You are not an ordinary Anma, are you?
You also stink blood yourself.
Under this tight space,
You shouldn't hold your sword like that.
My dear...
You killed someone again?
Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....
Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....
You fool!
Ouch!!
You are too noisy in the morning!
Go home already!
There won't be any more battles.
Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....
Anma-san didn't come back last night after all.
Maybe the gambling luck was with him.
Oogi-Ya
Master!
Yes?
I'm going to Sakai-sama's residence.
Yes.
Hold on a minute.
On your way back...
you buy something tasty to eat.
Thank you, sir!
Sure.
Next!
Kaneko Heishiro
Some Ronin are really strong.
Perhaps, we need Hattori to beat him.
You coward!
Wooden swords can't train
real swordsmanship.
If you call yourself a Samurai,
use a real sword!
You are Yamaji Isaburo, I presume.
That's right.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Hattori Gennosuke.
I must kill you to save my face and honor.
Grab your sword!
Kill me if you want.
A real sword...
I don't have one.
Even if you killed me,
you'd get no honor, I'm sure.
Wooden swords can't train
real swordsmanship!
If you call yourself a Samurai,
use a real sword!
He's almost dead.
Not worth killing him.
Come, quickly!
Why such a rush?
Shut up! I want you now.
You like it this way, don't you!
2 plus 3, HAN. <i>(odd)</i>

Anma-san...
Full of beautiful women...
Shall we check them out?
Hey young men!
You look rich.
Oh, yeah!
Thanks to this Anma-san, I won a fortune.
Is that so?
Will you pay for one night with us?
Anma-san...
With these two, shall we have some fun?
I'll talk to the mistress and get beautiful Geishas.
I'll take care of it, Young Master.
You stay here. I'll go.
You stay here, Young Master.
No, no. I'll go. You stay here.
Ah! It hurts!
I am not a rabbit! I'm not a rabbit...
Don't pull my ears!
We are not fighting, Young Master...
Ouch! It hurts...
No violence! No rudeness! Young Master, please.
This much OK?
Make sure you use all.
It hurts! Ouch!
It hurts! It hurts!
You're using a tiny needle.
So I must endure it?!
No. No. No.
The smaller the needle,
the greater the pain!
Thank you for listening...
Very funny!
Come over here.
Take this tip for you.
Thank you.
He was really funny!
Did you see that, Anma-san?
I can't see anything.
Osei-chan, are you ready to dance?
Dance! Great!
Dance now!
Young lady...
Why did you pull out the Shamisen's strings?
eh?
You're trying to rob money from us?
And you, the other one!
You're a guy, aren't you!
You don't smell like a woman.
Blind men...
are sensitive in such matters.
Hidden sword?
What's the meaning of this?!
Anma-san...
You may think I am lying...
...but I'll tell you the truth.
In fact, we were children of a wealthy Rice Shop.
Let's go and check Shiro-chan.
Don't tell anyone.
Heihachi...
Thanks for being a sleeper for 7 years.
Thanks.
Heihachi, where is the safe storage room?
This way, Sir.
How many in total?
Naruto-Ya husband and wife and their 2 children.
And 3 maids and 4 servants.
Tashichi, what have you found?
8 Senryo-Bako-Boxes of 1,000 coins!
They've gathered a fortune!
Innosuke...
We're rich for the rest of our lives!
Good! Get Boss Kuchinawa right here.
Yes.
You killed them all?
Tashichi, what about kids?
Well...we couldn't find them anywhere.
You fool!
We don't have time.
We got to go now.
Yes, Boss.
We hunted down Heihachi, the store manager.
What are you doing?
Store Manager of Naruto-Ya!
Don't you recognize us?
You... Naruto-Ya family?
I am the daughter!
We only know names
for the rest of the gangs.
Tell me their names.
They are Innosuke and Tashichi.
And they also mentioned the Boss Kuchinawa.
That's about what we know so far.
And all these years you've been hunting them?
CHO. <i>(even)</i>
Wrong again!
I'll try with my eyes closed like Anma-san.
How does he do that by only hearing?
Ouch!
This is not good at all...
5 and... One got away!
That's the problem.
HAN. <i>(odd)</i>
CHO. <i>(even)</i>
HAN <i>(odd)</i>

CHO! <i>(even)</i>

Shinkichi!
You're just sitting there
with your eyes closed.
Won't you bet?
I'm just listening to the sound.
What the fuck are you saying?!
You're sitting right in front of me
and listening to the sound?!
What?! Can't I listen to the sound?
You're asking for trouble?
Don't play tough with me!
This dump needs customers.
You bastard!
Take it easy, Shinkichi!
You can listen and bet some, will you?
Shinkichi!?
You shouldn't be talking like that to a customer!
Customer, my ass!
You used to work for me.
Shut up and bet!
If you insist, I'll bet now.
Last sound was... "Karan, Koron"
OK, then.
HAN! <i>(odd)</i>
HAN <i>(odd)</i>, Right?
Yeah!

4 plus 2, CHO! <i>(even)</i>
How was that?
Give my message to your boss.
What?
Go to hell!
Mourning
Izutsu-Ya
Is the widow in?
One moment, please.
What is it that you want?
Your late husband owes money from gambling.
I am taking your store.
eh?!
You got 3 days to go.
Not a day more.
This is crazy!
You butt out!
Matoya
They are pretty, aren't they?
You know them?
No.
Where did they come from?
They are young, too.
Master, give me sake, please.
Yes.
Osei-chan...
Should we ask this Master
for tonight's job?
Yeah.
Master?
Yes?
You know if we can offer our services anywhere?
We don't have jobs.
You know anyone rich?
Oogi-Ya is the number one client.
Thanks to Ginzo, he takes over other competitors.
Could you introduce us to Oogi-Ya?
Master, help the ladies.
Tell them you found beautiful ladies.
I see...
Old man, go to Oogi-Ya-san for these ladies.
Go yourself, you bastard!
Don't take advantage of the old man!
Go quickly!
I present you the windmill.
I'll bend it now...
Master?
What?
Matoya's owner is here.
He says there are two beautiful ladies asking for their services.
If you don't mind, they want your patronage.
Good. Bring them in!
You two, go away!
Sakai-sama, we'll bring in beauties soon.
Go quickly!
What do we bet now?

Now you see front and back of the fan...
Good! Good!
Oogi-Ya!
Yes.
How much longer do I have to watch this?
Dance!
Let's watch their dance!
Yes, Sir.
Hey! No more Spinning top!
The show is over. Go away!
Time to dance, ladies!
Quickly! Dance!

Anma-san, should we bet everything?
New game.
Are you ready?
Hey!
The dice don't sound the same.
You damn blind!
Anma is making scenes at Toba-gambling room.
Boss needs you.
Anma?
Please, Sir.
Let's go.
Leave me.
You come with me.
Do as he says!
What are you doing?!
Who are you?
Watch your step.
Ouch!
Watch your step there!
What are you looking at?
Anma-san...
Wait here.
I'll go see what's happening.
Ouch!
Ladies, come this way!
Quickly!
That Oogi-Ya, introduced by Matoya is horrible!
When the customer tried to take her,
I hit him with Shamisen Bachi-Pick.
Anma-san killed everyone
at Ginzo's Gambling place.
It was unbelievable!
Who are you, anyway?
If we stay here, they'll find us shortly.
We'll run to my aunt's place.
Run?!
Ginzo's men are all over the place.
How?!
That's true.
I have an idea.
You got any make-up?
Sure.
Anma-san, come here.
Yes.
Don't move.
What is it?
I'll paint eyes.
Paint eyes?
Hey! Open here!
Hey!
Who's that at this time of hour?
Who's that?
It's Shinkichi!
Shinkichi?
He probably lost everything again.
Come inside.
Who are these people?
Anma-san, this way.
Anma-san!
Idiot!
What happened to our Yojimbo-sensei?
Everything was over when Sensei came.
Who the hell is that Anma?
Don't really know. Just Anma...
That punk, Shinkichi, was with him.
A frequent customer, isn't he?
It wouldn't be hard to track him.
Just Anma... We can get rid of him at any time.
First we must make
the Funahachi Group extinct.
I see...
Before we know it,
we just travel from province to province.
Cheating men and robbing them.
10 years?
These punks must live differently now.
Hold on.
Wasn't Oogi-Ya here 10 years ago?
Right.
Indeed, that Oogi-Ya...
Something's not right about him.
On his arm...
He has a snake tattoo.
One moment...
What was the names you have a vendetta against...
Someone named Boss Kuchinawa?
Yes, right.
The name "Kuchinawa" means "snake".
Isn't that right?
Anma-san!!
Don't look at me with those eyes!
I've heard about last night.
Anma ruined your gambling place.
Yes.
We hurried there with the Yojimbo.
But we were too late.
Oogi-Ya...
Yes?
What happened to those ladies?
Well...
O-Daikan-Magistrate tried to take one for him...
But the other one hit me hard
with Shamisen Bachi-pick.
The way I saw them acting...
I am sure they are not ordinary Geishas.
Listen...
Check out anything you can
about that Anma and the Geishas.
Yes, Sir.
How about this?
HAN <i>(odd)</i>
The betting is closed.
CHO. <i>(even)</i>
HAN. <i>(odd)</i>
I won.
What are you doing here!
In the way!  Go away!
You're still eating breakfast?!
I told you to clean up, didn't I ?!
Hey, Seitaro!
You are wanted by our Master.
You, clean up this mess!
Come with me, Seitaro.
You are so lovely!
From now on, you will be my boy.
If you do what I say...
you are welcome to live here with your sister.
Are you happy now?!
I'll buy you some beautiful kimonos.
What are you doing there?!
Stay away from the Master's room!
Sister...
Never mind her. Come here.
No!
Young man!
You want to have fun with me?
Osei-chan...
Yes?
Let's practice.
Sister...
What's wrong?
Sister?
Nothing.
Are you OK?
Auntie, do you have an umbrella?
Over there.
I'm going to check out the town.
Thank you.
Old man, where is the Master today?
He had something to take care of.
Something to take care of?!
Why are you working in this dump?
You don't have any family?
No, I don't have any...
He picked me when I was a beggar.
I was treated good.
I'm thankful for what he has done for me.
Is that so?
It's better begging
than working in this dump.
Old man!
If you get out with a straw mat,
you'll earn more for sure.

What are you doing here, bastards?
If you want to run a gambling place,
you must pay for protection money.
What the hell are you saying?!
This is our territory to begin with.
What did you say?
You're looking for trouble?
We have no choice
but face Ginzo now.
Wait here.
He is something!
Hold on!
Hold on!
You're finished.
That Anma...
so he is Zatoichi...
And those Geisha women...
.. must be from the Naruto-Ya family.
Naruto-Ya...
When did we rob them?
10 years ago.
I see.
If the kids survived,
they must be grownups now.
But...
I wonder if that Yojimbo...
...can kill Zatoichi?
Is Oogi-Ya in?
Yes!
Boss Ginzo himself!
I'm glad you came!
This way please.
This way, please.
I've heard your business goes very well.
I told you not to come here.
Don't worry.
The Funahachis are history.
We're in charge now.
The only thing left to do is
to make our pockets full.
Clean up in here!
Big trouble!
Funahachi Group is extinct.
Ginzo's Yojimbo slaughtered them all.
Ginzo hired a strong Yojimbo.
Anma-san, you'd better not go to town.
Shinkichi-san, that Yojimbo is really so strong?
Yeah! He's unbelievable.
If we had to face each other at night,
who would be the winner?
If it was so dark,
no one would see a thing.
The winner would be probably you, Anma-san.
You laughed at me, didn't you?
Let's see you now.
I'll train you. Come!
I'll teach you the art of battle.
Concentrate.
Shall we begin?
Attack from all sides.
Not all at the same time!
Let's try again.
For safety, let's plan the moves.
Listen hard!
I go this way, first...
You hit here.
Then...
... you!
And then, you.
Good.
Let's try.
You see?
You see what you can do?
Faster now.
Ouch!
Ow...
Ouch! Timing is off!
No. That's not it!
Ouch!
Ouch! Ouch!
It hurts, you fool!
I won't teach you any more!
You stupid!
What are you doing
You fool! Go home!
Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....
I'll have a bath.
Me, too.
No! Men first.
I'm a man, too!
Anma-san...
I'm thinking of paying a visit to Oogi-Ya, again.
I must know if he was one of the thieves.
I see.
Auntie! Water is cold. Boil it!
Don't get on my nerves!
Bathing yourself at daylight!
You're useless!
I can't help it. It's damn cold.
Please, boil it a bit more.
That's what I'm doing!
It's unbelievable.
You really look like a woman.
Make-up makes men more beautiful...
Not necessarily true.
Depends on the face. Face!
Yay!
Running is the only way to victory!
Wait up!
Welcome!
Master...
We want to ask forgiveness from Oogi-Ya-san.
He paid us to dance for him and
we treated him disrespectfully.
Really?
Can you tell him we said we're sorry?
Sure. Sit down.
Oogi-Ya drinks too much.
He probably has already forgotten about it.
Don't you worry.
I hope you're right.
I haven't see you lately.
Where were you staying?
At Oume-san's house.
Anma-san with you, too?
Yes.
Are you alright, old man?
Yes.
Throw them out.
Drink Sake.
Thank you.
Oogi-Ya teamed up with Ginzo.
They are cooking up something bad.
But you are OK as you have nothing to do with them.
One more?
Not yet.
I'm off to Oogi-Ya's.
You wait here.
Excuse me...
Oogi-Ya says he's not angry at all.
He likes you and wants to see you both.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for Sake.
Good luck.
Where are the others?
They're off to the town.
What are you doing over there?
What are you doing?! Idiot!
I want to be beautiful, like Osei-chan.
You really surprised me.
What's all this fuss?
You're back, silly kid?
Where is Anma?
Who are you?
We want Anma!
He's not here.
You can't hide him from us.
But he's not here.
We'll burn down the house.
Burn it!
Stop! Hey!
Auntie! We're in trouble!
The house is on fire! Wake up!
We're in trouble!
Run!
Quickly!
Who are these people?
Shinkichi!
Shinkichi!
Damn!
Very beautiful woman.
Woman?
Things are not always
what they seem, Innosuke.
Don't use that old name.
The walls have ears here.
My name is Ginzo now.
What are you looking at?
Keep dancing. Quickly!
We know it all.
You're Naruto-Ya's kids, aren't you?
Hey!
Anma-san!
Ladies, run!
Call Yojimbo-Sensei.
Hey, Ino! Inosuke!
Where are you going!
Hey! Hey!
Where is Yojimbo Sensei?
He's over there.
Over there, my ass!
I told you to bring him over!!
I'm sorry.
Give me the sword!
Boss!
Boss!!
Boss!

All the bad guys are dead now.
Except Boss Kuchinawa.
He must be really old now.
He'll be dead shortly anyway.
Don't think about him.
You had better think about your future.
You can stay here.
You can become a man again.
I'm fine as I am now.
I wonder how Anma-san is doing right now.
He must be walking somewhere.
The festival starts today.
Who the hell are you!
You found me at last.
How did you know?
It's the smell...
You may change as much as you want...
but this awful smell will always stay the same.
Stop bullshitting, blind man!
I go by the name of Boss Kuchinawa.
A blind man like yourself...
will not slaughter me easily!
What the hell!
You're not blind?!
That's right.
Then why you pretend to be blind?
'Cause blind men can sense the human nature better.
Matoya
I knew you could see!
I knew it from the first time
you came here.
You killed all of my men.
And you killed Torakichi, too?
I mean the tavern Master, right here.
He was a kid beggar from the streets.
I taught him the business so he could be my successor.
By a traveling Anma like yourself...
all my gangs had been wiped out...
How did you know that I was
the real Boss Kuchinawa?
From the time you checked my
 walking stick to check the hidden sword.
You're the worst gangster of all.
Really?
In that case...
My retirement time has arrived.
But I've lived a full life.
I regret nothing.
Come on, kill me!
Wahhhh!
You don't deserve death.
Finish your life as blind man!
Even with my eyes wide open...
I can't see anything after all.
