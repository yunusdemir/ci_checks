All ahead full!
Destroyer coming in fast. Rig for
depth charge, silent running. Time.
Ten, nine, eight...
seven, six...
We'd better hold these reports
to Admiral Bowers, sir.
- Why?
- His car had a flat tire.
- Right rear. He's fit to be tied.
- Send them tomorrow.
Yes, sir. Captain Field's
a little touchy this morning too.
Another flat tire?
Almost the same thing. His wife.
They had a quarrel last night.
- Oh, that.
- l'm ready for action.
Passing up the decoy, sir. ln position,
heading straight towards the Akikazes.
- Stand by to dive.
- Aye, aye, sir. Range: 1,800.
Akikaze bearing

Clear the bridge. Dive.
Dive. Ready to shoot
in 25 seconds, sir.
Bearing, mark, fire.
Fire one. Twenty-four seconds, sir.
Torpedo running hot,
straight and normal.
You sunk him again, sir.
That makes 200 times
you sunk Bungo Pete...
in 200 days.
He only sunk you once.
Just once,
but it wasn't on a desk.
Where do you get
all these things, anyway?
Oh, tables, desks.
Mueller, you're a thief.
l'm a collector, sir.
Bungo Pete.
Let's put him next to his destroyer.
The unknown factor:
The Sea Dragon of Area 7.
There's nothing superhuman
about him or the area.
Too bad they won't give you
another chance, Commander.
Four submarines sunk
in the Bungo Straits...
- How many?
- and you're behind a desk for a year.
- They can't figure it out.
- How many subs?
You said four, l think.
- Yes, sir.
- The count was three a month ago.
lt's only scuttlebutt,
but the last boat sent there...
was lost three days ago.
Get these things out of here.
Mueller, when is the next sub due in?
Two weeks, sir.
The Nerka.
Her skipper was wounded, but
the executive officer is taking over.
- He qualified for command?
- Yes, sir.
- They'll send her out to Seven.
- l suppose so.
Get the chief of staff on the phone.
Tell him l'm coming over.
Executive Officer to Duty Section.
Now hear this.
The repair crew
will take over at 1300.
Duty section will stand by
with a repair list.
You beach boys going
to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel--
the hotel does not
have a repair crew.
So have fun, but keep the damage
to a minimum.
Break it up! Russo! Cullen!
For the next captain
of the Nerka, sir.
What we mean to say,
Mr. Bledsoe-- congratulations.
- Good luck, Captain.
- Good luck, sir.
So this is the way we start?
Bribery!
- What do you mean, sir?
- Next it's sunbathing on the deck.
A sunburned crew is a happy crew, sir!
lt's an old Navy axiom.
That you just made up!
Thanks a lot, men.
But don't think l can be had!
- The thought never entered our heads.
- l'll bet.
Try it on, sir.
You'll look sharp
on that bridge!
- See you a moment, Bledsoe?
- Yes, sir.
We were just leaving, Captain.
l said we were leaving!
lt's a-- sort of a gift, sir.
The men, they--
lt's all right. Never mind.
- Any milk in the galley?
- Yes, sir.
- lt's powdered, sir.
- That'll do.
She belongs to the chief of the boat.
Good luck token.
The men give her a pat
on their way to battle stations.
lnteresting.
l'll get the milk, sir.
Submarines.
They ruined my liver.
Couldn't take one again.
Terrible thought. Makes me old.
Makes me antique.
- You like subs?
- l chose the service, sir.
Yeah, of course.
- Good record.
- Thank you, sir.
lt's a fact, not a compliment,
so don't thank me.
l told you two years ago you could have
a sub one day. Remember?
Thank you, sir.
Well, you're going to, Jim,
but not this time out.
The Nerka's being assigned
to Commander Richardson.
He'll be your skipper
for this patrol.
You see, Jim,
she's going to Area 7.
Richardson's acquainted
with the area.
Seven's a hot spot.
We lost four subs there the last year.
All of them by an Akikaze
off the Bungo Straits.
His sub was the first. The Navy board
feels he deserves another chance.
That command was mine, sir. Don't they
think l can handle her in Seven?
Your ability isn't
being questioned.
- But Richardson's suggestion--
- Richardson's suggestion?
He presented a very strong case.
This whole thing is
suddenly very clear to me.
- That all, sir?
- That's all.
You won't mind if l keep this
out of mothballs, Captain?
There are other boats
besides the Nerka.
Rich? Hey, be careful!
- What's the matter?
- Would you like some lemonade?
Sure, honey.
l'll be down by the time--
- Better make enough for three.
- Three?
We have company.
- l can't see anyone like this.
- l don't think this is a social visit.
You'd better put some gin
in that lemonade.
Looking for me?
Commander Richardson?
- That's right.
- l'm Bledsoe. Jim Bledsoe.
A pleasure. Would you throw up
that insect spray, Jim?
Excuse me, sir. l didn't come here
to spray insects.
lt's the leaves you spray,
but it doesn't matter.
- What's on your mind?
- A request, sir.
- l'd like you to ask for another exec.
- Just like that?
My privilege, sir.
Navy regulations.
- l'd have to take it to the board.
- You went to them before.
Right. l got what l wanted.
Why change it?
Maybe l can enlighten you.
The crew has already
accepted me as captain.
They have me decked out as the groom.
Now l'd rather miss the wedding.
Are we discussing your pride,
or are you embarrassed to face them?
You'll be facing them yourself.
The resentment will be
twice as great with me there.
l'll be honest with you.
l don't care
about their resentment or yours.
l wanted a boat.
The board gave it to me.
They didn't. You went to them.
The sad desk commander.
With me as a backstop, you could do
the job. Wasn't that your selling point?
Mr. Bledsoe, your request
for release is denied.
Well, Commander, l'm glad l came over.
Sort of straightened things out.
We'll get along just fine.
Jim, l'll take good care
of the bride.
Anyone for a slug of gin?
- Lieutenant Bledsoe, Laura, my exec.
- Oh, hello.
Thanks, Mrs. Richardson.
l'll take a rain check.
- You sure?
- Some other time.
Lieutenant.
lf there isn't another time,
good luck.
Take good care of my husband.
l'll take care, ma'am.
- Take over, Mr. Conwell.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Captain's off the bridge.
lt won't be long now.
- Orders coming up soon.
- ls he downstairs yet?
- ''Below,'' Jessie. The captain's below.
- How much is in the pool?
Two hundred bucks.
Are all the areas covered?
l've got a five spot
on Area 22.
Sixteen. lt's a pleasure cruise.
- l took Seven.
- Seven! What?
- l took Seven.
- That's a one-way ticket, idiot.
Are you trying to jinx us?
- What do you mean, one-way?
- No return, Jessie.
But l was born on the seventh!
With all that money in the pool--
Well, seven's lucky for me,
isn't it?
Here. The money's locked up inside.
Tell the engine room we're standing by.
Hey, Chief, could l change areas?
Too late.
Gentlemen, l ask for silence.
The next voice you hear
will be the dealer.
This is the captain.
l know all of you are vitally interested
in our area assignment.
Here is a brief rundown
of the orders...
under which we will operate
during this patrol.
Number one.
l'm sure you've heard this many times.
Sink enemy shipping.
Number two.
Proceed on a specified course
to Area 7.
l just knew it!
For Pete's sake, turn it off.
Number three.
Avoid the section in Area 7...
known as the Bungo Straits.
Number four. Take coast intelligence
photos wherever possible.
A third of you are new men, and l know
there are bound to be some questions.
Feel free to ask your division officer
anytime. That's all.
Thanks for your attention.
Where are the Bungo Straits?
- Why?
- He said we'll avoid it.
He didn't say avoid Seven.
Give everyone back his money, Kohler.
No dice.
Somebody took Area 7.
- Who?
- He did.
Geez, fellas, l didn't know!
Well, it's my birthday!
Seven's my birthday.
Simulated target dead ahead, sir.
Range: 2,000.
All hands standing by for drill.
Very well.
Lookouts below!
Clear the bridge!
Dive!
- Depth?
- Thirty-eight feet, sir.
- Ruby, where's the scope?
- We're not at periscope depth yet.
Stand by to surface.
Now let's get this straight.
l want this scope up as we dive.
As we dive?
l want to be ready to fire at 50 feet.
This is new,
but get used to it.
This drill's purpose is to dive and fire
as soon as we level.
Let's try again.
Surface!
Blow main ballast.
Hard rise on planes.
Flow negative. Level off.
Eight-degree angle.
Depth: 40 feet.
- Steady on course.
- Mark 50, leveled off.
Fire one. Time?
Forty-two seconds, sir.
That's not fast enough.
Open those vents sooner.
- Aye, sir.
- Surface. We'll try it again.
Dive!
- Open the vents on the diving alarm.
- Taking a chance, isn't it?
The captain wants a faster dive.
You can always shut it.
Aye, aye, sir.
Dive!
Open them up!
Flood those tanks!
Dive!
- Mark 50. Leveled off.
- Fire one.
Thirty-seven seconds, sir.
Very good.
When we reach Area 7,
l want it down to 33.
- Thirty-three, sir?
- Right.
Yes, sir.
Secure from battle stations, sir?
Yes. Take the con, Mr. Cartwright.
- Secure from battle stations.
- Third section take watch.
- Up scope.
- All ahead one-third.
Light the smoking lamp.
l said secure. Your tails
can't be dragging that much.
What's the matter?
No gripes?
lsn't anyone going to say
it's a four-second difference?
Not a boat in the fleet
could make it?
Ruby, you worried about drills?
- No, sir.
- Poplin?
Look, l never keep anything
from a crew.
Don't keep anything from me.
Speak up.
Well, l guess it's Area 7,
Mr. Bledsoe.
Didn't you hear the captain
read the orders?
- That's it.
- They mentioned the Bungo Straits.
- What's the difference?
- That's where those subs were lost.
That's the graveyard.
And we've got orders to avoid.
- The Bungo Straits.
- Well, for Pete's sake!
- And we thought Area 7--
- Don't think.
Grab some coffee.
ln 30 minutes you've got another drill.
- Thirty-three seconds!
- We could leave the hatch open.
The water might pour in.
The boat might go down faster.
- How do we get back up?
- There's no room to swim anyway.
l heard you, Lieutenant.
Now that you've explained
the orders...
how do you explain
the purpose of these drills?
Captain to the bridge!
Easy, fellas! Take it easy!
She's got to last!
One pat to a customer!
- All ahead standard.
- l got it.
Radar contact dead astern, sir.
We think it's a Jap sub.
Has he seen us?
Hard to tell. Shall we open
the outer doors on the stern tube, sir?
No, just keep the present course.
Manned and ready.
Forward torpedo room,
manned and ready.
How long should we
hold this course, sir?
- What?
- Before we double back to get him.
We're not going to double back.
- Sir?
- l'm not risking it.
- We're faster. We could outmaneuver.
- Just hold her on present course.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Keep a sharp lookout astern!
Lost radar contact
at 6,500 yards, sir.
Very well.
Secure from battle stations.
Second section take the watch.
- l'll take the conn. Lay below.
- Aye, aye, sir.
You've had the boat
for a week, Captain.
You've probably noticed
she responds quickly.
Always a little shudder when you push
her too hard. Best to ease her into it.
Thanks. Anything else?
Just one thing, sir. She hates showing
her backsides to Japanese submarines.
Permission to go below, sir?
Granted.
Now hear this.
Orders of the day:
To your sacks, men.
You've got 25 seconds
to lay flat on your backs.
Any gripers want a sleeping pill?
He's a caution.
Give the skipper a couple,
will you?
A Jap sub and all these drills.
The captain must be running scared.
ls that it?
lt's the craziest war patrol
l ever started on.
Who said anything
about a war patrol?
You're all confused.
We're on a drill patrol.
The first time for the Navy.
What does it all mean?
What's he got in mind?
Haven't you heard? He's going
to challenge the Japs to a drill.
The winner will get
a free honeymoon trip...
with Tokyo Rose
in the Bungo Straits.
Gentlemen,
we are indeed fortunate.
Let's pay tribute
to that great motto--
''Caution with safety,
and safety with caution.''
No, let's do better than that.
Let's drink a toast to our beloved
captain, the drill master.
For he knew our boat was faster
than a Jap sub.
- l've had enough kidding, Jerry.
- Why? A captain with orders to avoid?
lf we avoid Area 7
as well as the Bungo Straits, we're in!
- l'll bet he's planning it now.
- Excuse me. Your watch list.
What about that, Mueller?
You're chummy with him.
l don't know what
you're talking about. Do you, sir?
Come back here, Kraut!
Get out, Mueller.
Go on.
lf you have questions, Cartwright,
you come to me, not to crew members.
And that goes
for your opinions too.
We'd better break this up.
lt's getting late.
Shut up.
Battle stations manned, Captain.
Standing by for drill.
Lookouts below!
Clear the bridge!
Dive!
Surface!
- Someone topside, sir.
- All stop.
Emergency surface!
Open up!
You all right?
l'm all right, sir.
l'm okay.
Who gave you permission
to dump the garbage?
- Mr. Cartwright, sir.
- l thought he'd asked the O.D., sir.
- l was on the bridge. l didn't hear--
- Get below.
Yes, sir.
Only the captain
gives permission to dump trash.
lnstead of losing time,
we almost lose a man!
Stand by to dive.
Check the watch, Mr. Kohler.
Aye, aye, sir.
Yes, sir?
- Have you been with this boat long?
- Over a year, sir.
ls this the kind of cooperation
you usually get?
No, sir.
A man could have been killed today.
The responsibility is yours.
You're in charge of the drills.
l have no excuses. But under the
circumstances, the crew did their best.
- What circumstances?
- Don't press it, sir.
l want an answer.
lt's one thing
to drill a crew for fighting...
but when you duck a Jap sub they wonder
why they should break their backs...
when the captain
has no stomach for attacking.
Does he want obedience? Efficiency?
Or the best drilled cowards?
Tell them l'm doubling the drills,
starting tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
You might as well know, sir,
l don't believe it.
- Believe what?
- That you ran because you're a coward.
Yeah, l understand. But what's the cook
supposed to do, eat the garbage?
- We haven't had a minute--
- Hey! Vince.
SJ contact.
Bearing 330.
Range: 15 miles.
- Looks like a big one, huh?
- lt's not a fishing boat, friend.
Picking up two of them now, sir.
Range closing.

Bearing 045.
- He's heading right at us.
- Keep the sound on, Cullen.
- We'll go deep in a second.
- Aye, aye, sir.
lf you've had any questions about
the drills, they'll be answered now.
We're taking on the Momo.
Right standard rudder.
Come right to course 045.
- Coming right, sir.
- Very well.
Open outer doors

- Take her down fast.
Aye, aye, sir.
Standing by.
- We got them!
- Thirty-two seconds!
Left full rudder.
All ahead one-third.
Now hear this.
Captain speaking.
You've just given
a Jap tin can the deep-six...
with a bow shot in 32 seconds.
This boat is ready for anything.
Let's keep it that way.
Drills: No more
than usual tomorrow.
Mr. Bledsoe, take the conn.
Get us on our base course.
Aye, aye, sir.
- Boy, that skipper!
- He knows his stuff.
Come here, you guys.
Listen to this.
''Dear Commander
Japanese lmperial Fleet.
Be it hereby known
that on July 31, 1943...
the U.S.S. Nerka, under the command
of Captain P.J. Richardson...
sunk a Japanese destroyer.
One down, 20 fish to go.
Signed, Kraut Mueller.''
Chief, we've been drilling
for a bow shot all the time.
- Weren't you up there?
- Right on the pickle.
That tin can zigs right into us.
l was shaking.
- What about the old man?
- Calm. No excitement.
He just orders two fish
right down her throat...
just like you'd order
ham and eggs.
lf we'd missed we'd never get to Area 7,
and we won't get out of it alive.
Go back to Sears, Roebuck,
will you?
Forgive me for interrupting.
You are listening to the voice
you call Tokyo Rose...
from the heart
of the mighty Japanese Empire...
telling you of a war you cannot win.
lt has been substantiated that we have
destroyed 16 enemy ships this month.
Come on, Rosie. Get up to date.
You're missing one Jap tin can!
That's right. Jessie!
Dear friend.
We've decided to be big about it.
We're not going to hold you
responsible for Area 7.
We'll take back the money.
Gosh, that's nice of you fellas...
but my conscience hurt me so much
l threw it overboard.
- Not now, Kohler.
- Don't shut me up again, Lieutenant.
l've seen all kinds of captains.
We've seen them together.
l never saw one run from a Jap sub...
then take on a destroyer with a shot
l didn't know was in the book.
There has to be a reason.
That bow shot didn't just happen.
The drills were planned for it.
The whole thing was--
l never heard of a bow shot
being set up other than in desperation.
lt's all like
some experiment.
Suppose a bow shot was the only way
he could get an Akikaze.
An Akikaze isn't a Momo.
There's a hell of a difference!
This Akikaze's
in the Bungo Straits.
But that's impossible.
The orders say to avoid it.
l know.
Look, l know how you feel about him
taking the boat and all...
but don't you think
you're working at it overtime?
We'll be hitting Area 7
tomorrow morning.
Four. Five.
Six.
lt's a convoy, all right, sir.
Bearing 320, relative.
Sounds like a whole lot of them, sir.
Right, sir.
l have the dive.
Depth: 60 feet.
Forward torpedo room manned and ready.
We're undetected, sir.
- After torpedo room manned and ready.
- We're dead ahead of the convoy.
What firing position shall we take?
Take her down, sir?
Take her down to 100 feet.
100 feet. Aye, aye, sir.
Five degree down bubble.
Secure from battle stations
when we level off.
- Yes, sir.
- Come right to course 280.
Very well.
Mr. Cartwright, take over the conn.
What's he doing?
What's going on?
- Give me a line on course 280.
- Sir?
- A line on course 280 now.
- Aye, sir.
- What's the skipper up to?
- Later, Beckman.
- Start leveling off.
- Aye, aye, sir.
There it is.
You might as well post it.
A whole area to patrol, and you pick
the graveyard! The Bungo Straits.
lt's the only place
we can get the Akikaze.
The orders say avoid it.
You make it sound like
a snap decision. lt wasn't.
That's quite obvious now, sir.
Passing a Jap submarine
to save torpedoes...
jeopardizing a whole boat
with a bow shot, ducking a convoy...
so they can't radio our position.
You planned it and knew it
the day l came to your house.
Before that, Jim. l knew it a year ago
when my boat went down.
We have orders. They're explicit.
Our crew expects the captain
to follow orders.
You know a captain can redefine orders
if he feels he has an advantage.
- What advantage?
- You named it. A bow shot.
We proved it with the Momo.
We can do it again.
You call that an advantage? Four subs
before us had no chance to shoot!
They were detected.
Not even Pearl knows where we are.
What about the Japanese navy?
No, sir. That's no advantage
in my book.
But you're not the captain.
lf you fail and somehow live, there
won't be a desk small enough for you.
That's strange, Jim.
l never even thought of failing.
You've got a lot of guts, sir,
with other people's lives.
- That's my responsibility.
- To whom? A crew that died a year ago?
Yes, to a dead crew,
a dead sub!
Now, believe what you want.
This crew's still alive. They have
a right to know where they're going.
Do l have to tell them?
What's the matter? Surely you've
got guts enough for this too.
This is the captain.
Due to conditions of special advantage,
l have decided...
to take this boat
to the Bungo Straits.
Bungo Straits...
broad on the port beam.
We're there.
Bungo Straits.
We're at the straits.
We're there.
We're in the straits.
lf l'd only been born
on the eighth.
See you a moment, sir?
- What is this?
- We want to talk to you, Jim.
- l've been reading the regulations.
- We want you to take over.
Well, that's very flattering, gentlemen.
Let's go. Everyone outside.
- We're talking about orders!
- What right--
A captain's right.
That's all he needs.
We'll make up our minds now.
- We're going to follow his orders.
- To the bottom?
lf that's what he's got in mind.
This boat, any boat,
has one captain.
- ls that right, Kohler?
- Yes, sir.
- ls that right, Mr. Cartwright?
- Yes, sir.
Let's break this up.
With all due respect to your rank,
l think you're an ass.
This report says you called
Mr. Cartwright an ass.
- Yes, sir.
- An officer?
- That's right, sir.
- Mueller, you're a damn fool.
Yes, sir. l know it.
But as long as l overheard,
you might as well know too, Captain.
They wanted Mr. Bledsoe to take over.
He put an end to that fast.
He would.
- Would you tell me something, Mueller?
- lf l can, sir.
- Am l a damn fool too?
- Sir?
Mr. Bledsoe seems to think l am,
and l respect his opinion.
Maybe you have to be
to do something like this.
You nailed that Momo
with a bow shot.
Why not the Akikaze?
The Akikaze never misses, Mueller.
Well, he will this time.
ls that a classified opinion,
or am l at liberty to repeat it?
That's a fact, sir-- a fact they'll all
realize at Bungo Pete's funeral.
Convoy now bearing 313.
Range: 7,000 yards.
Are we going to set up
on the leading ship, sir?
No, that's a decoy. Shallow draft.
Used to draw fire away.
You could shoot ten fish.
They'd only run under.
There she is,
pulling up to the convoy.
- The Akikaze?
- Yes.
She'll keep astern of both columns
until they zig.
Look at her come through there.
Must be making 30 knots.
Doesn't stay in one position long enough
to give you a target.
Not unless she's coming toward you.
Take over in the conning tower.
Start tracking the next-to-last ship
in the port column.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Right standard rudder.
- Right standard rudder, sir.
- Very well.
This is the captain.
The convoy we've been waiting for
is on our starboard bow.
The plan of attack is as follows:
First, we'll strike a freighter
going in.
lf that doesn't bring
the Akikaze toward us...
we'll attack the freighter
nearest him.
When the Akikaze does
head toward us, bow on...
we'll dive and give him two fish
at 1,500 yards, just like the Momo.
Let's go.
All ahead standard.
- All ahead standard, sir.
- Very well.
All ahead standard.
How's the target course and speed
check with the TDC?
Course checks.
Speed: one knot slower.

Plane's 15 miles.
Range closing.
They're closing fast, sir.
Plane's closing fast, sir.
They must've known.
The Japs must've known we were here.
We're going in according to plan.
Give me the setup.
- Stay right on that freighter, Beckman.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Range on the freighter is 2,000, sir.
Track 70, gyro 20 right.
Recommend firing course 297.
Come right to 297.

Both fish hit.
She's headed down.
- Stern tubes ready, sir.
- Very well.
Aircraft range steady.
Appear to be circling overhead.
Right full rudder.
All ahead flank.
Shift target to Akikaze.
He's coming on. Bearing coming down.
- Bearing 250.
- 250, sir.
Radar to Bridge.
Aircraft returning.
Range: 4,000.
Tubes three and four ready.
Outer doors open.
- Shall we take her down, sir?
- Not yet. Lookouts, below!
Stand by.

- We'll have to fire from surface.
Commence firing!
Fire three.
- Three fired, sir.
- Three's away, sir.
Clear the bridge!
Dive!
Take her down to 300, fast.
Give me a time check on that fish.
- Twenty-four. Twenty-three.
- Torpedo screws, sir.
Heading in toward our port side.
Must be that last torpedo, sir.
- lt's a runaway.
- Coming back at us.
Crash dive!
Sound collision alarm!
Passing 75 feet, sir.
Passing 90 feet, sir.
Destroyer coming in, sir.
He's shifting to attack frequency, sir.
Picking up splashes, sir.
Depth charges on their way down.
Passing 150 feet.
lgnited, sir!
- Pass along that ''T'' wrench.
- Leave it. lt'll stop at 2,100 rpm.
Forward Torpedo Room reporting.
Hatch was blown on the main--
We cannot make--
Forward Torpedo Room.
- Phone circuit's out, sir.
- Check on the damage.
- Captain wants a report on the damage.
- Couple of dogs sheared off the hatch.
- Can you fix it?
- We'll know in a minute.
Turn on emergency lights.
Torpedo Room.
Forward Torpedo Room, report.
Take the conn.
l'm going to check.
- Leveling off.
- All ahead one-third.
All ahead one-third, sir.
- ls the hatch sprung?
- Couple of dogs sheared off!
Close the hatch!
Come on, close the hatch!
Losing depth control. Heavy forward.
Request more speed, sir.
Forward room must be flooding.
All ahead standard.
- You okay, sir?
- Yeah.
Compartment flooded?
Partially.
Three dead.
They're coming in for the kill, sir.
The only way to get out of this alive
is to make 'em think we're all dead.
- Send up an oil slick?
- Send up blankets, gear, everything.
Jim.
The men that were killed--
send them up through the tubes.
Yes, sir.
Screws diminishing, sir.
Captain, there's something else here.
Listen.
What is it, sir?
l can't make that out.
What's the situation on the hatch?
lt's okay, Captain. The engineer should
have the new parts ready in a few hours.
lt's well secured
with a block and tackle, sir.
Clear the compartment.
Okay, everybody out.
Come on.
On the double.
Let's go, fellas.
What is it, sir?
l can't make that out.
Better take a swallow, sir.
- What is it?
- A stimulant, from the medical safe.
lt's 100 proof, sir.
- How long have l been out?
- Just a few minutes, Captain.
You'd better worry about yourself, sir.
You're in for a pretty rough time.
Hendrix knows what he's talking about.
You've had a pretty bad concussion.
lt's worse than that.
There's a medical term for it, but it
just means blacking out now and then...
for quite a while.
lf you don't keep off your feet, sir,
you'll be blacking out permanently.
You'll keep this to yourselves.
- But, sir--
- That's an order, Hendrix.
Send for Mr. Bledsoe.
- Well, go on.
- Yes, sir.
The torpedo firing circuits
will take 24 hours to repair.
We'll have to set up
a jury-rig for the radio...
and the radar needs some work too--
that's another 24 hours.
That's not bad, considering.
- We'll lay over two days, then move.
- Yeah. The timing's perfect.
Those convoys come out
every 48 hours.
- You really got shook up, didn't you?
- No.
No, l couldn't feel better.
- Then maybe l didn't hear you right.
- You heard me right.
l'm talking about the straits,
going back to the Bungo Straits.
We're through playing with lives.
lt's the end of the line.
Why?
Because a torpedo went wild?
You know yourself
that's a hundred-to-one, an accident.
The whole Japanese air force
dropping everything it's got.
That's an accident too?
The next time around,
we'll make it.
What are you gonna do, swim back
to the straits or use a lifeboat?
Because that's all the help
you're gonna get.
Those are tall words.
You better stop and think a minute.
l have thought about it, Captain.
That wasn't exactly a tea party
the crew held before.
They wanted me to take over then,
and they'll feel the same way now.
Make one move to take over this boat,
and l'll see that you're hung.
Then we'll hang together.
The orders were disobeyed.
lt's a proven fact.
A fleet boat of the Navy, a submarine
with her fighting power still intact...
and you'd take her back to Pearl?
l don't believe it.
Mr. Cartwright.
Yes, sir?
Mr. Cartwright, we'll lay over two days
for repairs before returning to Pearl.
l'll be in command.
Get a detail started right away.
Yes, sir.
That's all, Cartwright.
Yes, sir.
The best exec l could possibly get
in the whole Navy--
the backstop, you said--
and the first command you give
as a captain is to order a retreat.
Good-bye, Bungo
Hello, Pearl
- Funny, funny, funny.
- What's with you?
l'm tryin' to eat.
Knock it off.
- What is this, a private dining room?
- You wanna sing, go to the head.
lt'll take more than you
to put me there!
Break it up! Break it up!
What's the matter with you guys?
We're goin' back to Pearl, aren't we?
How many patrols have you had,
Mr. Sears, Roebuck?
- This is my second.
- Well, l've had five since '42.
l've taken depth charges,
shells, strafings...
even a bombing run off the Solomons...
but it's the first time l've gone back
to Pearl with 15 torpedoes still aboard.
- Kohler.
- Yes, sir?
- Get the torpedo check started.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Cartwright, do you think
we could've had him, sir?
- What?
- Well, suppose--
Suppose that fish
hadn't gone wild, sir.
That aircraft wasn't playing games.
The Japs detected us before we moved in.
- But the captain said--
- The captain's flat on his back.
We'd be better off if he'd been there
sooner. Get started before the watch.
This time words just fail me.
- lt's this way, sir--
- Why didn't you stop him?
- l didn't know--
- Weren't you here?
- Yes, sir.
- You let it go on?
- No, sir.
- lt didn't happen?
- Yes, sir, it happened--
- l'll put every one of you on report!
lt was my fault, sir.
Go on up to the bridge.
Tell the O.D. you're on report.
- What'd you say?
- l only said that--
l told you once, Mr. Cartwright,
to keep your opinions to yourself!
Now get out of here.
Yes, sir.
l'm not gonna stand for any fighting
or insubordination.
lf you think you've got a soft touch,
you're mistaken! You hear?
Wow. How about that?
Chewing out an officer
in front of us.
He was chewing us all out.
What's he so sore at us for?
- Turn it up a bit.
- lt's okay. Let's leave it.
What are you tryin' to do,
break the plate?
You are listening once again
to the voice you call Tokyo Rose.
- Ed, turn it off.
- Did you like the music?
l play it tonight for the wives
and sweethearts of the submarine Nerka.
You'll never see these men again.
The Nerka has been sunk.
lt lies at the bottom
of the Bungo Straits.
They bought it.
We send you our regrets...
to the relatives
of Captain P.J. Richardson...
of Officers James Bledsoe,
Gerald Cartwright, Carl Beckman...
of Seamen Jessie Warner,
Kraut Mueller--
- Kraut Mueller? How could they--
- Listen.
You'll never see them again.
Think about it.
Think what your country has done
to these men as you listen to the music.
They even named us,
the officers, the crew.
How could they possibly know?
- Welsh.
- Yes, sir?
Were any dispatches, any messages sent
after we entered Area 7?
No, sir. We cut off all radio
transmission. Captain's orders.
No information, no transmitting
of any kind left this boat in Seven?
That's right, sir.
Yes, sir.
Did you ever sign your name
''Kraut'' Mueller?
Only on that notice l put up
about the Momo destroyer.
Russo.
- Where's Russo?
- Yes, sir?
The trash in the garbage sacks--
how do you weight it? Answer me!
Tin cans, broken tools, anything l can
find that'll help weight the sacks down.
- Does it sink?
- l think so, sir.
- You think so?
- l can't say for certain, Mr. Bledsoe.
Did you dump any sacks
off the Bungo Straits?
Yes, sir.
What have l done now?
How do you feel?
l'm all right.
Repairs are completed.
We're ready to move.
Well, the crew must be very happy.
Aren't you?
That's what you wanted, isn't it?
That's what l wanted.
l see.
- You're going back to the straits.
- That's right.
What changed your mind?
l found out
how they detected us.
Those fishing barges along the coast
have been picking up our garbage sacks.
For the first time,
we have a real advantage.
Sure, Jim.
l made the same speech.
But you and l both know
that the odds are still against us.
There's always a calculated risk,
the unknown factor.
Let's not kid ourselves.
You're going back
because you've been through it...
because you have to go back.
You knew l would.
Let's say l had a hunch your order
to retreat wouldn't be carried out.
Okay, Rich.
l guess the real reason l came in here
was to tell you that l--
Good luck, Jim.
We all know
they think we're sunk.
There's no way
for them to know we're here.
Every angle has been covered
except the risk of battle.
We're gonna make that risk pay off.
Any more questions?
There must be something
you want to ask.
Well, sir, we all thought--
Would you mind stepping over here
a moment, sir?
Be my guest, Mr. Bledsoe.
Thanks, Kohler.
lt was a privilege.
Decoy leading as before.
There she is. The Akikaze.
Traveling about 30 knots

l can't make that out.
Very well.
Lookouts to the bridge.
Mr. Cartwright, same plan of action.
Draw the Akikaze to us by attacking the
last freighter in the starboard column.
When the Akikaze comes in,
we'll give her a bow shot as before.

Blow negatives. Level off.
Plane her up to periscope depth.
What is it, sir?
l can't make that out.
Take a look.
Sir. Listen.

Bledsoe! Take her down!
Sound collision!
Take her down fast!
Sound collision! All ahead full!
Flood negative! Take her down!

Hard dive on planes.
- Torpedo coming at us! Another runaway!
- lt can't be! Both of them were hit!
lt's not ours, it's theirs.
lt's from another sub.
That's what sunk all our boats.
A Japanese submarine.
She missed us.
Captain,
hadn't you better go below?
Passing 90 feet, sir.
All ahead one-third.
Level off at 120.
Level off at 120, sir.
Rig ship for silent running.
Shift to manual control.
Shut down ventilation.
Secure all of the machinery.
No unnecessary movement or talking.
Here he is, sir.
l've lost him.
They've stopped their motors.
Let's make it a standoff.
All stop.
All stop, sir.
We can't hold her down too long
without some speed.
We'll have to start the motors soon.
Let's hope they start theirs first.
When was his last true bearing?
135. But the bearing's no good
without knowing his depth.
And we can't get that.
We gotta get him to surface.
There's a convoy still up there...
With the Akikaze gone, he's gonna
have to come up to protect those ships.
Well, suppose we sink a couple.
- Do l have your permission, sir?
- You're the captain.
- Stand by to surface!
- Standing by!
Secure from silent running
and collision!
All ahead full!
Reload forward tubes when we surface.
Shift targets.

- Keep a sharp lookout, Johnson!
- Aye, aye, sir.
Fire three!

New radar contact,
bearing 303 relative.
That should be our friend.
There he is.
He's changing course.
He's moving in behind the decoy,
using it as a screen.
Right standard rudder.
Come right to course 069.
Right standard rudder.
Coming right to course 069, sir.
Very well.
That decoy--
you say it has a shallow draft?
Yeah, that's right.
We could shoot under it and hit the sub.

lt's 38 days now
since we left Pearl Harbor.
l know how some of us felt then.
l think l know how some of us feel now.
But let no one here,
no one aboard this boat...
ever say we didn't have a captain.
''Unto Almighty God we commend the soul
of our shipmate departed...
and we commit his body to the deep...
in the sure and certain hope
of the resurrection unto eternal life...
when the sea
shall give up her dead...
in the life of the world to come.''
