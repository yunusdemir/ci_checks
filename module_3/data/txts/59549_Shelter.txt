When I call your name,
step out and tell me your date of birth.
You hear your name, you'll be moved to
another holding cell. From there, court.
- Stand in line. Brendon Johnson.
- Yes, sir.
Tahir Ibrahim Abdi.
No papers.
No. No other record sheet.
Nigerian: Came in on a visa in 2008...
and has overstayed his welcome.
Okay.
Sign here.
Thank you, officer.
And here.
- Thank you.
- Sign here for your personal items.
Thank you.
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, you are just doing your job.
No reason for me to be impolite.
Now, the policeman
who did this to my face,
- that's another story.
- You wanna make a complaint?
You are funny. I like you.
I don't like you. Now, get out of here.
I can go?
The charge was reduced to disorderly conduct
which is a civil offense, not a crime.
ICE says, until you commit a crime,
you are not a deportation priority.
- Thank you, officer.
- Okay, get out.
No, no, no.
Jerry. Jerry!
- I had no choice, Tahir.
- What happened?
- There was too many of 'em.
- What happened to my things?
There used to be an understanding
between our kind. A code.
- I watch your things, you watch mine.
- Not no more.
- That's what we said.
- Well, I'm sorry, Tahir.
- But there was loads of 'em.
- Alright.
- Big fellas, too.
- Alright, alright. You're alright.
Jerry...
You are wearing my boots.
- What?
- Those are my boots.
Them make some good winter boots.
I know.
That's what I said when I got them.
They're my boots now, Tahir.
They're my boots now.
Come back again on Friday.
We would like to see you both.
You come back for lunch anytime you want.
Good to see you. Are you back?
No. No, I just need some clothes
and bedding. My things were stolen.
- How?
- I left the door to my penthouse open.
Come inside. It's a thousand degrees.
You don't wanna come back
into the program?
No. Really, no. I just need
some clothes and bedding.
Can't just give out the clothes, Tahir.
Clothing pickup is on Thursday
between three and five.
You're welcome to come back then.
And we don't give out bedding.
- It's going to rain this evening.
- So why not stay here tonight?
Come back, Tahir.
I shouldn't be here.
This is exactly where you should be.
- Excuse me, can you spare a cigarette?
- Oh, sure.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Can I have another one? Please?
Thanks.
Excuse me, can you spare some change?
Excuse me, can you spare some change?
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Have a great day.
Excuse me, can you spare a cigarette?
Thank you. Can I have one more?
Excuse me, can you spare some change?
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, can you spare some change?
Can you spare some change?
Come on.
Stop following me.
What is your fucking problem?
- That is my jacket.
- Your what?
That's my jacket.
You got it back on Jerry's alley.
- It's a hundred fucking degrees out.
- It is mine.
You want your jacket? You just want your
jacket then you're gonna leave me alone?
I just want what is mine.
Here.
Now, go!
Go!
Come off the bridge.
I know why people come up here.
I wanna go! I wanna go!
I wanna go, please!
I wanna go! I wanna go!
Stay here for a minute.
I made you a bed. At the end.
On your own, you know?
I'll sleep here.
Good morning.
Eat. There is nothing of you.
What is your name?
Alright, now hit the drum. Ready?
Go!
Come on.
Left down. Go! Now you. Now you.
Thank you.
No, no. Thank you.
No, no. Thank you. Lady, we have no money.
- Then why'd you stay in this line?
- What?
- Why didn't you stand in this line?
- Fuck you.
- What's the problem?
- The vagrant wants money.
That bitch! Perhaps...
she can suck my dick first.
There's not enough money in the world
to make me touch your tiny cock.
- You speak French?
- Yes, why not?
Because I am on the streets?
Or because I am a stupid American?
- No, we just didn't think you spoke French.
- Never judge a book by its cover.
Listen, my boyfriend...
he just returned
from a tour of duty in Iraq...
and he gets a bit twitchy
when people are rude to me.
Why not show him
how much you liked his music.
Thank you.
Goodbye... and welcome to America!
What just happened?
They just really liked your music
and didn't know how to express it.
- You like movies?
- I do.
- You do?
- You like... you like Robert DeNiro?
- I do.
- You do?
Okay, you ready?
You talking to me?
- What?
- I wanna ask you a question.
Okay.
Do you really believe?
- Yes.
- Yes. I... Yes.
But I mean...
- do you really believe?
- With all my heart.
Okay.
- What?
- It seems a bit unwarranted, doesn't it?
Why?
Come on!
What?
- You're a hobo. You're a tramp.
- So?
So he doesn't really seem to have
liked you very much, does he?
The prophet said,
I looked into paradise and the majority
of his dwellers were the poor.
- So?
- So in heaven...
the poor will have recompense.
After you've died?
That's convenient, isn't it?
That's what you say.
That's what you say!
Besides, he blesses me all the time.
How so?
Hey! Buy something.
I just... need a few days.
Can you give me a few days?
A few days.
I can't do that. I mean,
why would I do that?
Cause I don't have it,
so I can't give it to you.
- You got something.
- I got five fucking dollars.
Look, you want it? You can have it.
What am I gonna do with five dollars?
So, give me a few days.
Or you could be nice to me.
- Tahir!
- Get him off me!
- Stop!
- My nose!
I owe him money.
You shut up.
It doesn't matter how much you owe him.
- Man, why you give a fuck?
- Because she is my woman.
Yeah, for the right price.
Fuck, man!
My fucking face. Shit.
- How much does she owe you?
- Half a bundle.
- What is that?
- Fifty-dollars, you crazy motherfucker.
Here, I have ten, twenty, thirty, forty.
It's all the money I have in the world.
If I ever see you near her again,
you'll see me again.
Out your fucking mind, man.
Not now.
Do you feel remorse?
I do.
Do you resolve never
to commit the sin again?
Yes.
Have you made restitution for this sin?
Made recompense?
I can't.
The man you beat up?
Whatever the sin is, it is a private
matter between you and Allah.
If repentance is sincere,
you need only ask.
Allah, forgive me.
He will forgive.
I pray to repent, not for forgiveness.
Allah forgives, Tahir.
The objective is the be forgiven,
not to be judged and condemned,
but you must make restitution.
You must put it right.
Did you get what you needed?
You?
No. Bad day.
We'll be hungry tonight.
What is it we are waiting for?
For God to provide.
What?
We gotta go!
Come on! Come on!
Excuse me!
Come on!
Hurry, come on.
This way. Come.
Tahir.
Go, go, go, go!
Over here.
Hey!
Let's leave it.
Someone's home.
That's why the door's open.
Rich people are careless.
That's why it's open.
Hannah.
Hannah!
Hannah!
Hannah.
Where are you, Hannah?
Hannah!
- It's not much, but its home.
- We need to leave now.
- Why?
- It's someone house, Hannah.
- But they're not using it right now.
- What?
- They're at the beach.
- Put the drink down.
Look, they have kids!
It's summer. They're rich.
They're at the beach. The Hamptons.
- Maybe even Europe somewhere.
- No, no!
- Definitely at the beach.
- No, Hannah, we can't.
Tahir, we need something good.
This is something good.
This is wrong. It's dangerous.
I wanna kick.
I could kick in this place.
Found it.
Gone 'til September.
Okay, but we keep our bags
packed by the door.
Have you done this before?
What do I do?
Not tonight. The night always wins.
Start tomorrow.
Tonight we celebrate.
So I am barefoot.
The man's shoes didn't fit.
I smell chicken. Did you find chicken?
I feel unbelievably stupid suddenly.
I must look like a zombie Goldilocks.
This is where you should say something.
Actu... actually, don't...
don't say anything.
- I'm just gonna peel potatoes.
- I forgot how to speak for a second.
You are more beautiful
than I have words for.
Let's not go overboard.
Why don't you set the table?
I found placemats and everything in there.
Just because something is hard to
comprehend doesn't mean it's not true.
How old do you think the world is?
About four and a half billion years old.
Okay, good. So you're not a creationist.
Have you ever been to Nigeria?
I am from Lagos.
We have skyscrapers and a rail system.
You picture me running
around in a loincloth?
Okay, fine. So...
We've established that you're not
a creationist and I am a borderline racist.
How long has man been on earth?
About a hundred and thirty thousand years.
And God appeared when?
To Abraham about four thousand years ago.
So, for a hundred
and twenty six thousand years
of uninterrupted squalor and disease,
God was fine with it?
He just sat on his hands
and then four thousand years ago
decides to do something about it?
I don't claim to understand.
I know this, when I pray I am with Allah.
He speaks to me alone.
He talks... not to my mind,
but to my heart.
What do you believe?
Well, I believe I need another drink.
No, I mean it. What do you believe?
If there's nothing... if there is nothing
then how do you explain all of this?
I can't comprehend it.
Well, just because you can't comprehend
something doesn't mean it isn't true.
Now you are just being clever.
Answer the question.
I believe in the big bang.
Okay.
So who made the big bang?
- Well, that's the problem.
- Yes.
But I see no reason to solve it
with an even bigger problem.
What do you mean?
What made God?
- Well, Allah is eternal.
- Hard to substantiate though, isn't it?
Why can't we see God? Where does he live?
And why does he turn otherwise good
people into murderers in his name?
- You're funny.
- In what way?
In a contradictory way.
I'm not the first Muslim to drink.
I'm not talking about a sneaky beer
before Ramadan. You properly drink.
- You use this drug that harms you.
- You're talking about cognitive dissonance.
Heroin dulls the pain,
but it'll probably kill me.
But that assumes that I see dissonance
and not cognizance.
I need to use the powder room.
Are you tired?
I'm not ready for tomorrow to come yet.
Come to bed with me.
I used to live in a place like this.
I used to sleep in a bed like that.
- I was married.
- It's alright, Hannah.
I know it's fucking alright.
He was a surgeon.
He enlisted in the reserves after 9/11.
And then someone came to my house
and told me he was gone, just like that.
The coffee in my hand
was still warm when he was gone.
He was killed in terrorist attack
on a military checkpoint.
I didn't know how to be
in the world without him.
And now I've made such a mess.
I don't know how to be
in the world at all.
It'll be different this time.
It'll be exactly the same this time.
Hannah?
- Hannah.
- Please, don't come in.
This is bad. This is bad.
Something's wrong.
I've done this before.
I'm telling you this.
I'm telling you something is wrong.
You know people hemorrhage from this.
You know you can have a fucking aneurysm
from this. My fucking head is dying here.
You've come so far, Hannah.
We're nearly there.
We are nowhere.
I'm the only person here in pain.
Fuck this! I can do what I choose!
I choose out.
- I choose out and you can fucking stop me.
- You're right, I can't stop you.
- That's right! You can't stop me!
- You're right, I can't stop you.
Sleep would help.
I need to make some money.
Will you be alright on your own?
- Excuse me. I was watching you play.
- Yes.
You're... you're good.
I mean, it was really something.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
What do you want?
So I was talking to those...
those... guys over there
and they said that
they'd seen you with her.
This is my daughter, Hannah.
Is this your... is that your girlfriend?
I'm not with anyone.
I don't know your daughter. I'm sorry.
This is really important to me.
Would you look again please, sir?
Just... I'm sure she's changed.
It's an older picture, but...
I would think you could recognize her.
Please, just... would you
just please look at it again.
I don't need to.
Those men just took your money.
I'm sorry to bother you. I...
No, no. You see, no, I'm sorry.
I don't buy it.
I don't buy it. And I'll tell you why,
I've been out west.
And I retired out there a few years ago.
But every month for the past 3 and
a half years, I've been coming back here
to look for my daughter, and I can't
tell you how many false leads I've got.
You know, let's of people
lie to you to take your money,
but nobody ever said that guy over there,
right over there, he knows your daughter.
Because that would be a stupid lie, because
I'd go back and I'd come and get my money.
I believe you do know her.
So I'm gonna ask you a favor.
Okay, this is Jake. This is Jake.
He needs his mother.
I'm sorry for your trouble.
Really, I don't know her.
If you concentrate hard enough
you can change the colors of the lights.
That's not faith by the way,
it's willpower.
You would say God can change the colors.
I'm saying we can.
- Come on, try with me.
- No.
- Didn't God tell us to try everything once?
- No, he didn't.
- Why didn't he?
- Because some things are just wrong.
So... he covered the earth in highly
addictive and highly yummy heroin,
- but we're not supposed to use it.
- Right.
- Despite it growing naturally on his earth.
- That's right.
What a sneaky little prankster God is.
- Are you concentrating?
- Stop now.
- Shame on you.
- Excuse me.
Shame on you.
You have a child and he has nothing.
No mother, no father, and for what?
- Because you are broken?
- What are you doing?
Look at the photograph. He is alone.
You have never seen a boy
who looks more alone. Look at him!
My grief is many things. It has made me
behave in ways that I regret
and in ways
that I do not fully understand yet,
but the one thing I know, it is
overwhelming my fucking business.
Talk to me. Tell me,
how could you do this? Who are you?
Who am I? I am a woman
with a murdered husband,
a heroin addiction, and a child
that I haven't been a mother to.
Who the fuck are you?
You know everything about me.
You've left me with no shade,
and meanwhile, I know not
one fucking thing about you.
Not a thing. Who am I?
Who the fuck are you?
- You don't want to know who I am.
- I think I do.
I come from a place more violent
than you can imagine.
Yes.
I watched my wife
pulled from under our bed.
Raped and murdered while I hid
in a cupboard with our son.
The whole time she looked
at me and I looked at her.
My hand still over my Ibrahim's mouth.
After, we ran to the streets
to hide in a crowd,
but in that crowd, a bullet chose my son.
I'd give anything to be with him again.
I'd give anything to see my boy again.
That's why I don't understand you.
- I'm sorry, Tahir.
- I'm not finished.
Alright.
At the funeral, a man came to me...
and he said, Tahir,
Islam is a beautiful flower...
but sometimes it needs thorns.
The next day I joined Boko Haram.
What... what is Boko Haram?
I became a murderer of women and children.
I burnt churches.
I burnt schools, police stations,
military checkpoints.
That's who I am.
I watched people burn and for nothing.
I watched people die like your husband.
There is no peace in it, Hannah.
Hannah, I'm sorry.
Please no.
Don't.
You can get back to your life, Hannah.
You can have it all back.
Please don't.
I recognize that I need
something different.
I tried to disappear...
but my son held me in life.
What I did is unforgivable.
Can you help me get back to him?
Who are you?
God, grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change,
courage to change the things I can,
and wisdom to know the difference.
- Alright, thanks for sharing everybody.
- Thank you.
Now remember, this is your rooms, y'all.
Keep coming back.
It works if you work it, right?
Excuse me. Hey, Hun.
Where you running off to in such a hurry?
...that extension.
I didn't wanna miss the meeting.
But I gotta give it to the landlord
before he clocks off at 6.
Otherwise we're gonna be out on our ear.
So I really gotta run.
You run off, but I want you to think
about sharing sometime, okay?
- Okay, I will. See ya!
- See ya. Thanks for coming.
- Thanks, Franklin.
- Take care. Thanks for sharing, too.
- How'd it go?
- She was incredibly nice.
She gave us a ten day extension
while our case is reviewed.
Which she reminded me
would be denied because
you don't have your papers
and we're not married, but...
with the storm coming, I don't know.
She chose to be nice.
She even let me sign for you
when I told her how sick you were.
You should've seen Terry's face downstairs
when I handed him the extension letters.
I thought he was gonna break his teeth,
he clenched his jaw so tight.
How you feeling?
A bit better I think.
I'm gonna make you a bowl
of hot water in the steamer.
So what are we going to do?
We need a plan.
We have a plan. We're gonna get you well.
And then I'm gonna find us
a place to move to in ten days time.
And then in three weeks, I'll have finished
my internship and I can get a proper job.
So if we cannot find a place in ten days,
I'll go to a men's shelter.
- No, we stick together.
- And you will go to a woman's shelter.
I just got us 10 days. Why you trying
to get rid of me before I've even tried?
I just need to know you are safe.
Geez.
Like a grumpy old man.
Come on, grumpy.
Put your head down.
How do you feel today?
Did you make your meeting?
I nearly missed though because
of the whole extension thing.
- You can't afford to miss, Hannah.
- I didn't miss.
I'll tell you what I can't afford.
I can't afford to spend a winter in a
women's shelter around a bunch of addicts.
Maybe you are ready to go home.
Would you come?
I'm not ready yet.
When I go home to him,
I want it to be for good this time.
That's funny.
Today I realized I can see the future.
I don't mean in a paranormal way, just...
I hadn't given it
much thought in a while...
but then...
today I was able to see
myself back with Jake.
And then I saw him a little older.
He was walking down a street somewhere.
He was holding hands with you.
<i>I saw us at his graduation.</i>
<i>Tahir, I saw us old together.</i>
<i>Can you imagine?</i>
<i>I haven't been able to see
past the day in so long.</i>
<i>And...</i>
<i>I just thought about...</i>
<i>what we would do and...</i>
<i>where we would go.</i>
<i>It was nice, you know?</i>
<i>Simple.</i>
<i>But it felt like there was magic in it.</i>
<i>Like I could move the horizon.</i>
Mister...
- Mister...
- Abdi.
Abdi had a chronic asthmatic attack
which is probably due
to a combination of the flu
that you say he was suffering from
and perhaps the dust from hotel room.
It's not impossible that the steam
you say he was inhaling
acted as a trigger for the asthma attack.
It's very difficult to know. It's rare,
but we do see that sometimes, too.
But he is stable now.
We have him on a breather mask and it's
supplying him with oxygen and Albuterol.
And he's also taking a steroid.
It's called prednisone.
It's to help him breathe.
It's one of the cortical steroids.
It mimics the adrenal gland
and acts as an anti-inflammatory.
But he'll be fine, right?
- Oh, he'll be fine.
- Okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're very welcome. I just...
Can I stay with him?
Are you married?
We're together.
What Mr. Abdi needs right now is rest.
I think it's best if you come back
tomorrow during visiting hours.
- I understand.
- Okay?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Did I miss curfew?
Terry. Terry.
- I didn't miss curfew.
- It's not curfew. Your status is changed.
Excuse me?
Your status... has changed.
I have a room for two people.
You are no longer two people.
You received the extension notice
that I gave you...
- that was signed...
- For two people.
You're only one person.
I'm sorry but I cannot in good conscience
give you the room.
Why are you doing this?
Is that room even occupied?
You're missing the point, Hannah.
Evil minded, you know that, Terry?
What happened to you?
Whatever happened to make you
such an asshole?
Whatever it was I hope it fucking hurt.
I hope it wakes you up at night haunted,
you sad fucking sadist.
- Enjoy the streets, Hannah.
- You know what? Go fuck yourself, Terry.
Excuse me, miss.
Excuse me, miss.
Have you been through triage?
Sorry. No, I'm not a patient.
I'm sorry, miss,
but you're gonna have to leave.
My boyfriend's here. Upstairs.
I don't have anywhere else to go.
It's past curfew at the shelters.
Did you say your husband?
Your next of kin, right?
- Yeah, my husband, that's right.
- Well, okay then.
Just for tonight.
- I don't wanna see you here tomorrow night.
- You won't.
I will throw you out.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Hi.
- Hey!
Sorry I haven't been here.
I've been running around all day.
Where did you sleep?
I'm trying to sort out the Terry thing.
I don't think it's gonna work out.
- Do you have a place for tonight?
- Yeah. I found a placement.
It was hard though. Everything's
booked up because of the storm so...
- I can't even stay long, but...
- Get going. You don't want to miss curfew.
Asshole.
You fucking scared me.
- I missed you.
- I won't have too much longer.
They're letting me go tomorrow.
We've been observing him for three days.
He's ambulant and he's well enough
to leave the hospital.
- If he continues to take his medication...
- Really? Because it's 20 degrees outside.
And by the way,
you are required to treat everyone
regardless of the immigration status.
This has nothing to do with his status
as an illegal immigrant.
We've looked after him well. He has had
great care. He is simply well enough...
Excuse me. It's a crock of shit.
I'm sorry. You know it.
You know it's about a bed.
He's not well enough to leave.
I'm sorry. What qualifies you
to make that prognosis?
You don't have to be a doctor to see
that he's not well enough to leave.
Actually, yes, you do.
I spent four years as an undergraduate.
Four years in med school,
three years in residency,
and a further two in fellowship. All of
which makes me a quote unquote doctor.
And in my opinion,
this patient, Tahir Abdi,
is fit and well enough
to leave this hospital.
I got stuck at the hospital.
I'm sorry, Hannah. It's just regulation.
It was curfew and there was
still a line of people.
- I'm not allowed to hold your bed.
- I know. I know.
Just stay calm. Let me make a phone call.
See if I can find you a placement.
Tracy? Did she speak to Tracy?
I don't know.
Okay. Well, go have a seat.
I'll go see what I can find out.
Okay, I don't know who she spoke to,
but we are definitely full to the bursting.
But I found you a place
at the Tillary Street Women's Shelter.
In Brooklyn?
Okay, so I gotta get to Brooklyn.
It was the only thing I could find.
Usually our van would be here to...
take you over there,
but because of the storm.
Look, here.
You're gonna wanna take
the R to... Jay Street.
You look freezing.
I've got reason to.
Don't you have anywhere to go?
Nope, not tonight.
It's a rough night to be out.
It's not fit to walk a dog in.
My daughter's about your age.
Oh, yeah?
What's her name?
Listen, I can't let you in here.
They have cameras all over the lobby
and it's more than my job is worth,
but if you go around the block,
I can let you in the back
and you can sleep in the boiler room.
- Really?
- Yeah, really.
So I'll meet you around back.
Okay? It's a big, green metal door.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, you're welcome very much.
Couldn't have you get to your death
out there, could we?
I'm sorry. It's not much.
Oh, no. It's perfect, honestly.
There's more blankets in there.
It's so kind of you, really.
I'm beginning to feel my feet again.
What are you expecting?
Well, now I'm embarrassed.
I mean you're getting a bed
for the night...
so we don't have to... but you know...
this is New York.
It's not a something for nothing town.
Look. Let me look at your face.
Mary.
My daughter's name is Mary.
You asked earlier.
She married a real clean guy.
They live out in Jersey City.
Three kids.
Listen, I need you out of here by five.
Five-fifteen at the latest, okay?
I'll wake you up at four forty-five.
I'll bring you a coffee.
Okay?
Okay?
Look, since you aren't married,
the city is gonna give you a hard time
if you want shelter together.
We'll go to BAT
to get you guys a placement,
but for the best chance,
we need to gather some documents
and that'll take a few days,
maybe even a week.
The best I can do right now is get you
into separate shelters for men and women.
He couldn't get into a shelter.
They said he was a...
risk and disturbance with his coughing so...
they sent him back to the hospital
who won't take him either.
I see it all the time. People push back
and forth between shelter and hospital.
And finally, they give up.
It's just not an option.
He can't be on the streets right now.
That's why we really need a place
where I can look after him.
Okay.
Look, we will do everything we can,
but there's just no place I can
get you both into tonight as a couple.
Here's a list of some
of the documents we'll need.
And in the meantime, I can arrange a place
for you to stay tonight on your own.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I got you a sandwich.
- Cool.
- Any luck?
- Nothing. Not even Abdul had space.
You? Not even for yourself?
No.
- I couldn't find anything.
- Not even for yourself, Hannah?
- I want you to go home.
- I want you back with me.
It would be easier for me
if you were not here.
- How much medicine do you have left?
- Enough.
I have enough.
I know a place.
I know a place we can go
and stay together.
We are very grateful. Thank you.
I'm not so sure this is such a great idea.
I mean, there was
just one of you last time.
It'll be the same as before.
We'll be quiet.
You'll be out of here
every morning at five?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Okay. We'll try it.
I'd sure like to help you people,
but I don't wanna lose my job.
You know...
Where's your inhaler?
Where is it?
And the steroids?
Okay.
Alright.
I'm here.
I'm here.
Breathe. Breathe.
Exhale.
It's gonna be okay.
So this is fifty.
This will cost you thirty-five
and the steroids are...
- two eighty-five.
- Two eighty-five.
You know, I lost his insurance card.
Is there any way that you could process it?
I can't do anything without a prescription.
Can you have your doctor call it in?
What are the last four digits
of his social?
<i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, who's that?
<i>Jake.</i>
<i>Who's this?</i>
Is your grandpa there?
<i>Gramp!</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Who is this?</i>
- Hi, Dad.
<i>Hannah? Hannah, is that you?</i>
<i>Where are you? Are you coming home?
Tell me you're coming home.</i>
I wanna come home, yeah.
<i>Well, where are you? I'll come get you!</i>
- I'm still in New York.
- <i>That's great.</i>
<i>I can be on a plane by tonight.</i>
No. No, you don't have to do that...
Maybe you can just wire
the money for a train ticket.
<i>Hannah, you know I can't do that.</i>
<i>Tell me where you are.
I'll come and get you.</i>
I'm clean, Dad.
- I swear to God.
- <i>No, I can't. I can't. I can't.</i>
Truth is, I need the money
for my boyfriend.
He's sick. He's run out of his meds.
- <i>No, no, I can't wire you money.</i>
- I'm not using.
- <i>And you know why. You've said that.</i>
- I'm not using, Dad. I swear to God.
- It's been four months now.
- <i>You've said this before, Hannah.</i>
I know, I know, I know I have
and I know how it sounds,
but I promise you this time it's true.
- <i>Why did you lie to me about the train ticket?</i>
- I don't know. I don't know.
Stupid. Stupid. I just...
He's... he's... he needs his meds.
He's so sick and I didn't think
you'd believe me.
They cost three hundred
and seventy dollars. I...
<i>Well, if he's that ill then you
should take him to a hospital.</i>
We've been.
Look...
Dad, I know you shouldn't believe me.
I know that I've given you no reason to.
- I promise.
- <i>No, honey. You're lying.</i>
- <i>You're lying, sweetheart.</i>
- Please. Just this one more time.
Please. This time it's true.
<i>I wanna believe you so much, Hannah.</i>
You can.
Dad, you can.
I just need a little bit of money...
and just a little bit more time
and I'm gonna be home.
<i>If I give you money,
then I'm part of the problem, Hannah.</i>
<i>And I can't be part of the problem
anymore. I can't help you, Hannah.</i>
<i>I love you. I love you.
But until you want help...</i>
- <i>...I can't help you.</i>
- I want help.
I want help, Dad.
- Come see us.
- <i>No, you're lying.</i>
- Come see us if you don't believe me.
- <i>I love you. I love you so much.</i>
I love you. I love you, Dad.
I love you, Dad. Don't go, please!
<i>I can't!</i>
Fuck!
I... put some cushions
that I found in my garage
in your place there.
Thank you.
I need some money for medication.
Can you help me?
Sure, how much do you need?
Three hundred and seventy dollars.
Okay.
Okay.
What does three seventy get me?
Well, what do you expect for that?
I don't wanna negotiate
with myself, Hannah.
You just tell me what you wanna do for it,
and then we'll come to a compromise.
Merry secular Christmas to you.
How did you do this?
- Never you mind.
- No, really.
- How did this happen?
- It's a Christmas miracle.
Where did you get the money from, Hannah?
- It doesn't matter.
- Because it does.
Don't be angry.
I want us to be happy tonight.
You're better.
I need to know.
I called my father and asked him
to wire some money for a train ticket.
Hannah, you should've bought the ticket.
I called him back. I told him
that I'd lied and explained to him why.
He said tomorrow he's gonna
wire the money for two tickets.
I won't go alone, Tahir.
I won't.
Alright.
Tomorrow we will go.
We're gonna live, Tahir.
I mean, really... really live.
Tonight's our last night with you.
You know there's another storm coming.
We're going away.
Okay.
I'll miss you.
I mean it.
I'll miss you.
Where are you going?
Out west.
Beautiful.
I need five hundred dollars.
Hannah?
Hannah.
Not for me? Not for me?
You fucking bastard.
No!
Here. Eat.
- I'm not hungry.
- Just some soup?
- While it's warm. Please?
- Stop.
Did you take your meds?
- Tahir?
- Yes.
- They're not helping?
- No.
Okay, let's go to the hospital. Now.
- And then what?
- And then you'll get well.
- Then I go to prison.
- Don't.
And you spend the rest
of your life waiting for me.
Don't!
We've tried too hard for you to do this.
Hannah...
I want you to go home.
I won't leave you.
Listen to me, Hannah.
I have a chance to do
one good thing with my life.
Let me do it.
Lie down.
Come, Hannah. Please come, Hannah.
Come.
Hannah.
Lie down.
Go home to your family.
And I'll go home to mine.
Last night...
I dreamt...
Ibriham put his hand
in the River Ongatu back home.
And the water that swirled
around his fingers...
made its way to Lake Chad...
<i>and down the River Niger...</i>
<i>and into the Atlantic Ocean.</i>
<i>At that same moment...</i>
<i>I put my hand in the East River here...</i>
<i>and our fingers touched.</i>
<i>His little hand...</i>
<i>in my big hand.</i>
<i>I would like to think
I am going to see my son again</i>
<i>and be with Iza...</i>
<i>but I am afraid I am going to hell
for the things I have done.</i>
<i>Or worse, that you are right
and there is nothing.</i>
You are the kindest man
that I have ever known.
You're an angel.
You're not going to hell.
Nothing as perfect as you
could exist without a reason.
For the couple
who lived outside my building.
