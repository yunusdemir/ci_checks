Excuse me.

Coming, coming...
Postman!
How are you?
Verywell, thankyou.
Get out of there, Indian!
Okay, Cowboy, almost done.
About time!
Ooh, it's gone cold!
Was it Postman?
Yes, yes. He says hello.
Okay, thanks.

HORSE
1, FLOWERY LANE, VILLAGE
Letter for you, Horse.
From my brother-in-law Jean-Claude.
"Dear Horse.
I hope you are in good health."
"I wish you a very happy birthday."
Your birthday?
Sure. Like every June 21st.
Right, I'm off.
We didn't buy Horse a gift!
Oh no! No gift!
- What will we do?
- I don't know. Let me think.
No gift, no gift...
I've got an idea! A cap?
Oh yes...
It's not easy.
Got it!
Follow me, Cowboy!
Horse!
- Now what?
- Nothing.
We'll clean our room.
Watch the door.
- All clear?
- Yes. Carry on.
Right, we'll do this, and this...
X squared,
Zero hypothesis, para-lateral...
INDIAN.
Perfect! Come see.
- What is it?
- A barbecue.
We'll build Horse a barbecue.
A barbecue?
Oh Indian, that's great.
Yep.
- The trouble is...
- What?
We have no bricks.
I know where there are bricks.
Come on.
Hurry, hurry!
Easy does it.
Where are these bricks then?
Here.
What! We need much more than that.
Look: 50 bricks.
50! What will we do?
- We'll order some.
- How?
Where?
- Here.
- What?
Now what?
Nothing.
Hold on, Indian.
- What will we do?
- You'll see.
Indian!
Are you trying
to break my door down?
Now what?
It's Steven,
Hello, Steven. How areyou?
My tractor's broken.
Can you pick up the animals
from music school?
- I'm busy,
- They're in...
Mrs, Longray's class,
Mrs. Longray's class!
Okay, I'm on myway.
Another quick shower!
Mrs. Longray, Mrs. Longray...
Nice fresh breath.
A splash of deodorant.
And we're off!
Quick, quick, quick!
What?
Look at this.
Hello there!
It works!
Yes! I'll get some coffee.
Hello, pal,
My name's Max,
I'm going to help you buy bricks,
To start with, type
your name in capitals,
INDIAN
Very good, Now write
the number of bricks you need..
Easy! 50.
Very good..
Now press Okay,
It's Steven,
So did it work?
Did Horse fall for it?
- Well.
- It was fun, huh?
- Coffee?
- Yes, please, Cowboy.
It worked well.
Good-bye.
That was Steven.
Now press..
There.
Thanks, Indian,
- Hi, Simon.
- Horse!
I'm off to Mrs. Longray's class.
Horse, come here a moment.
Now what?
You can't just walk
into a music school.
I'll take you.
How's Cowboy?
Fine, fine.
And Indian?
They're both well.
Keep the noise down.
The kids these days are so rude
and badly brought up.
That's Mrs. Longray's class.
Are you trying to break that?
Do you do that at home?
Clean up your waffle.
I have to do everything!
Not going in, Horse?
Are you shy?
- Just knock.
- It's just that...
- Wait, Simon.
- What for?
Mrs. Longray?
Can you keep the noise down?
- Mr. Horse.
- Hello, Mrs. Longray.
I've... er... come for...
Steven's... animals...
Children, class is over.
Put your things away.
Quietly.
Bye, Teacher.
Did they study well today?
Yes. They're very talented.
- Not as much as Horse.
- Me?
- You're good at music?
- No!
Don't be modest. Play for me.
We'll wait in the car.
- I'm all ears.
- Very well.
There you go! Well?
I'll be very honest.
- It's a disaster.
- It is?
Why not study piano
with the animals?
Aren't I too old?
- No. You'll be fine.
- Great, Mrs. Longray.
Then so be it.
- Are you coming, Horse?
- Hang on, kid.
Simon.
Enroll Mr. Horse for 50 piano lessons.
He starts this week.
50 piano lessons for Mr. Horse.
Hey, Simon!
Make it 100.
100 lessons? You're sure?
Yeah, no probs.
Mrs. Longray, I'm very happy.
So am I.
See you very soon, Mr. Horse.
- Hello.
- I've brought your bricks.
- I'll sign.
- Stop!
I made the order. I'll sign.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
- Lovely bricks!
- Okay, bye.
What's all this?
Fifty million bricks! Oh no!
Indian!
Are you all right, Indian?
- Cowboy?
- Is that Horse?
I'll be late.
I don't know what's up.
There's heavy traffic.
I'm stuck at a crossroads.
See you later,
Who was it?
It was Horse!
Shirts, underwear...
Good luck, Indian.
You ordered all those bricks.
I'll just make the Miami plane.
You bastard, Cowboy!
Good luck!
Come back!
Out you come, Cowboy.
Help me stack the bricks.
- What will we do?
- No idea.
At last.
Horse!
I can't wake the great lump.
We can't stay here forever!
Put this on.
Good sounds, Donkey.
Rip me one.
- No probs.
- Good night.
Now what?
My car!
My engine!
What's this?
Hey! What's that big pile of bricks
in front of the door?
A barbecue foryour birthday.
Happy birthday, Horse!
You remembered!
- Here. Your gift.
- A chocolate hay-bale.
Looks delicious.
I'm exhausted.
- Taste it.
- Go on.
- Evening, all.
- Hello, Policeman.
- Unwrap your gift then.
- What could it be?
- A portrait of me.
- Breathtaking!
- I like it too.
- Careful, everyone!
Move aside!
The bar is open.
Come and get your drinks.
- Brilliant!
- Here, Janine.
- Beer for me.
- I'll have a Kir.
- A Tango.
- Another beer.
Horse!
Time for the candles.
- Go on, blow them out.
- Blow hard.
Sorry.
Never mind, we're fine.
Wow, Horse, that was some blow!
Who wants some chocolate hay?
I'd love some.
Just a small piece.
- A beer, Simon.
- Coming right up.
Thanks.
Come on, let's dance.
Everyone on the dance floor.
Strut your stuff!
Awesome!
Jack of hearts. Your turn, Indian.
- Any more beer, Horse?
- Your turn then, Janine?
Nine of diamonds.
Postman's dancing like a madman!
Your turn, Cowboy.
Now what?
Good evening.
Happy birthday, Horse.
- How did you know?
- Janine told me.
- For you.
- More bricks?
Thank you. You're very kind.
A Mozart cap!
It's great!
Thanks, Mrs. Longray.
You can call me Jacqueline,
you know.
Mrs. Longray, your hair looks lovely.
Doesn't it, Horse?
Oh yes, really lovely...
Thank you. I did it for you, Horse.
I'll leave you to it.
- Who wants a stuffed pepper?
- I'd love one.
I'm thirsty!
A beer.
How about a dance, Steven?
- Let's dance, Policeman.
- Coming, Janine.
- You dance well, Policeman.
- I know.
What am I doing down here?
Policeman!
You're dancing with my wife!
I'll teach you!
This is getting nasty.
Come on then!
- A beer on the house.
- Shove your beer!
With Policeman!
Have you no shame?
- I'll teach you...
- Enough, Steven!
Good night, everyone.
That was a close one!
- He drank too much.
- He always does.
The beer was too cheap.
I should've priced it higher.
Right then, one for the road?
Sure thing.
- We had a great time.
- Bye, Policeman and Postman.
Good night.
I'll get the gear tomorrow.
Okay, Simon.
I had a lovely evening, Horse.
It'll fail its inspection.
- Can't you stay a bit longer?
- I'm afraid not.
I have to teach tomorrow.
- Your car is completely broken.
- I know.
Let me take a look.
Try it now.
AmaZing, it works!
Good night, big boy.
Don't forget your piano lesson
on Wednesday.
Well, well...
Time for bed, huh?
Good night. Thanks for the barbecue.
- My back!
- My arms are like jelly.
Good night, Indian.
What the...
Oh no!
Cowboy! Indian! Wake up!
Quick, get out!
Hurry!
Time to get up, Steven.
Up you go.
Janine!
- What?
- Coffee!
Oh no, Steven, stop!
Okay, Rooster, we're up!
Good God, my tractor!
A terrorist attack!
Good God!
My tractor!
Janine, come see my tractor!
- Good God, my tractor!
- What's wrong?
Animals, outside!
Pigs, cows, everyone!
- A disaster!
- Calm down, Steven.
Calm down?
Have you seen my tractor?
Bring it in the kitchen.
This instant!
I slept well.
Dear Lord!
- Dear Lord!
- No, it can't be!
Oh no, not this!
Dear Lord, Indian!
The house collapsed.
I knew a barbecue was a dumb idea.
We should've bought him a cap!
I don't believe it.
- Postman! How are you?
- Fine, thanks.
A big envelope foryou.
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.
This is a long letter.
50 million bricks!
I never ordered these!
My house!
It wasn't us, Horse.
APPROVED BY
The wrench, Sheep!
A bit more air, Janine!
It's working again!
Even better than before.
Reverse and forward!
Okay, animals, stick to my tires!
No slacking!
The road's blocked.
More gas, Steven.
Follow me. Single file!
We'll cut right through it.
Oh, my head!
You two!
Come on then.
- Sure.
- Coming.
Hello, Policeman. How areyou?
I've felt better.
Come on! We'll rebuild the house.
What happened here?
One brick, two bricks...
- Get it?
- Got it.
- Then carry on.
- To work!
One brick...
Another brick.
Not so fast, Indian.
Useless rascals, where are they?
No, Horse!
Come on, to work!
Horse! Horse!
Finished!
We've finished.
Well, boys... Good job!
Too right.
Where's the door, Indian?
The door...
- And the windows?
- We forgot them.
Come on, quick.
We'll finish tomorrow.
Don't break my door down!
Can we sleep here tonight?
Okay. But only because it's you.
This way.
You'll be fine here.
Cow will see toyou.
Good night. And no messing around.
- We're sleeping here?
- This way.
You'll sleep up there.
Here are some blankets.
- Thank you, Cow.
- My pleasure.
Good night.
Lights out, Donkey.
Lights out, Donkey!
All right, all right.
Silly cows!
Thanks.
What a day!
There's always tomorrow.
Wakey, wakey!
Up you go!
Let some air in, it stinks!
Good God!
My walls!
Where are the walls?
I don't believe it.
They were here.
Damn! Our lovely walls!
All right, all right.
- Mr. Horse?
- Mrs, Longray,
The piano lesson has started.
Aren't you coming?
Sorry, but I can't come today.
What a shame!
Hold on a moment.
Enough, Donkey.
I've told you three times.
This is Simon. I'm disappointed
you're not in class.
- Back to your place.
- Okay, okay.
- Understand?
- Hold on, Simon.
We start from scratch. Get to work.
Again?
We've got better things to do.
Don't argue, Indian.
- Get to work.
- Okay, Horse.
Not too fast, Indian.
All done.
Now we can sleep easy.
One, two, three!
- Jean-Paul!
- Sorry.
Horse?
Well, well...
Well, Policeman?
This chain was cut. Right, Cowboy?
- Where are the walls?
- What happened to them?
Stolen. But I'll catch the thief.
Steven, can you cut this
with your pincers?
They cut everything.
There. Cut.
A clear-cut case.
Steven, you're under arrest.
What?
You'll go to jail for stealing walls.
What, jail? Whywould I want walls?
I havewalls!
Steven!
Oh my God. It's all dark in here!
No, Policeman!
Janine, visiting hours are 11:00 to 12:00.
Policeman!
Open this door!
Horse!
Policeman arrested Steven.
He says he's the thief.
- What? Steven didn't do it.
- That's what we said.
My God, Steven's in prison!
We have to catch the real thief.
- Step one: rebuild the house.
- Again?
So no pasture today?
Movement.
- Well?
- Just a squirrel.
Keep the noise down.
They're asleep. Let's do it.
Wait for me.
- Who shot?
- Who do you think, idiot?
- There go our walls!
- The thieves!
Not so fast, Michel.
Stop with my walls!
I said not so fast.
Watch out!
The thieves!
Where are we going?
Not so fast. Hang on.
Come down, Jean-Paul.
- And Gerard?
- He'll meet up with us later.
There's one!
This way.
Wait, I twisted my ankle.
Wow, nice place!
Look.
My paint pot.
Ring the bell, Cowboy.
Hold on!
Why does Cowboy get to ring?
I can ring too.
Very smart!
Run, Indian!
Poor Indian.
Serves him right, he wanted to ring!
Careful, Cowboy.
The thief's footprints!
Careful, Horse.
A trap door.
A lever.
A lever? It's my turn this time!
- Okay, Horse?
- Fine.
Yikes, a giant bat!
- Where?
- Behind you!
The thief!
Why do you keep stealing my walls?
What have you done with my walls?
Come on, spit it out.
Did you hear us, pointy-head?
Okay, I'll give you your walls back.
- What's your name anyway?
- Gerard.
My fingers are cramping up.
Hang in there, Cowboy.
It's a big drop.
Maybe Indian will save us.
I don't want to sound pessimistic, but...
- Indian!
- Cowboy!
Horse! All right?
That's not good!
- Your turn, Indian.
- I just went.
Horse, then. Horse?
Pass.
Your go, Cowboy.
Three kings.
Your turn, Gerard.
- Four aces. I win!
- Again?
Four aces? You cheat!
Who me?
I can smell burning. Can'tyou?
Look, lava!
We're nearing the earth's core.
The earth's core?
Lava!
Good God, we'll all melt!
Hold on a sec.
I've an idea.
Cowboy, your lasso.
Indian, your bow and arrow.
Watch this.
Thanks a lot. Bye!
- Are you okay, Indian?
- Fine.
How about Cowboy?
How are you, Cowboy?
- Where's Cowboy?
- I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
We'll find him.
Horse!
I don't believe it.
His rifle.
Indian...
it's yours now.
Look after it.
- Hands off my rifle!
- Cowboy?
- Where are you?
- Here.
- Where?
- On the rock above.
Climb up.
And don't forget my boots.
Yes? Hello.
It's for you, Horse.
My class is starting.
Did you forget again?
No, I remembered. I'm on myway.
Very good. See you shortly.
Simon wants a word.
Hello, Horse, it's Simon.
- What's wrong withyou?
- I'll explain...
Where's the fire?
Behind you, Simon.
Okay, you can resume class.
Huh?
Wait for me, Indian.
A way out!
- I found a way out.
- Good job, Indian.
I saw it too.
Well, well.
Stay there.
Come on, Cowboy.
Snow?
- Snow!
- Snow...
Snow...
Snow everwyhere!
I think we're lost, boys.
Back to the cave.
Yeah, it's freeZing here.
Horse. Indian.
Look, Gerard's footprints.
Well spotted. We've got him now.
Hey Horse,
lucky I saw the tracks, huh?
Ifl hadn't seen them,
where would we be now?
- All right, Cowboy?
- Fine.
Wow, I could eat a horse.
- Hey, Horse!
- Now what?
Got anything to eat?
Just keep walking.
I can see something.
Did you say something, Horse?
I can see something moving.
Where are we?
Gerard!
Not you again!
Are you following me?
It's your fault we're in here!
What's that?
It's a giant ladle. Move away!
It's huge.
- Lovely snowball.
- Wow, perfect!
What is that thing?
It's gone.
It's coming back!
Weird.
Wow, it's high!
We need to get out ofhere.
Watch it!
- All right?
- Fine.
These guys are nuts!
Oh no!
I left my rifle up there.
Ah, hello, sir.
Stop! Let me go!
I'm really, really fed up!
What a mess!
It's absolutely filthy.
That's the village. Hey, guys!
The village is on TV!
Come see.
Okay, okay...
Indian? Cowboy?
Horse?
What's going on, Janine?
- I'm worried. Horse is missing.
- Maybe he went shopping.
Is it snowing?
- Janine.
- What?
Come see.
How weird.
Who threw that?
Are you throwing snowballs?
Horse's walls!
What are they doing here?
What's that?
Don't touch a thing.
Leave it for the police.
- What's this?
- Horse's wallet.
Cowboy, Indian and Horse are missing.
That's what I've been saying!
- What about Steven?
- I think he's innocent.
Steven, good news. You're free.
See? I told you I didn't do it.
- It's dark.
- Careful.
- Which way?
- Ahead.
Janine, that's enough!
Okay, camera 7, camera 8...
Good, now, where are they?
Hang on...
What the... already broken?
Be brave, Indian.
Theywant more coffee.
Darn!
Here you go.
All right, Indian?
What was that?
Okay, they've gone.
Almost there...
Let Cowboy do it.
Look!
- It's working.
- We're going home!
Come on, guys, quick!
I forgot my keys.
- What keys?
- No idea.
Now, what did Cowboy do?
The red button.
Did it!
Here he is.
Hurry up, Gerard!
That was close!
- I'm not sure about this, Horse.
- Don't worry, Indian.
Cowboy, you messed up!
- Where's the village?
- Yes, where?
But the setting was fine.
Absolutely! Home at last!
Bye, everyone.
Where's that idiot going?
Maybe to get some food.
Really?
Morning, Janine!
Delicious toast!
Fantastic coffee!
Off to work!
No hanging about!
Sun's up!
- Look!
- What?
Watch the post!
What fool put that here?
They're missing.
It's in case someone's seen them.
I know them!
Cowboy and Indian. It's them!
That Gerard's taking his time!
- Maybe he got lost?
- Can you see anything, Horse?
You guys, are you stupid orwhat?
I'm fed up with this!
Where the hell are we?
Where's Cowboy?
- No idea.
- Here I am.
Let's find that bastard Gerard!
When we find him, we'll beat him up.
Right, Horse?
Is Gerard's place far?
Ah, I'm so thirsty.
What are they?
At last. My house.
- Our walls!
- Careful!
It's Gerard.
Look, another one!
Gerard! You're back.
What do we do?
We'll get him.
Is this really a good idea, Horse?
You stole my walls! Come here!
- I want my walls!
- Mom!
Hey!
What's all the noise?
He wants to beat me up.
He stole our walls.
If it's true,
you'll give them back this instant!
Yes, Mom.
Hello.
Mr, Horse, please,
- Anyone here called Horse?
- That's me.
It's for you.
- Horse?
- Mrs. Longray!
You never come to my classes.
The animals are progressing fast.
How will you catch up?
I had a slight problem on the way.
Give us our walls back now!
Make it snappy!
Okay, but how?
- Via the garage.
- Good idea.
Yes, Mrs. Longray.
I'll be right there.
- It's sorted.
- Good.
Let's go.
Mrs. Longray's expecting me.
- After you.
- Thanks.
Go round the back.
I'll open the garage doors.
He looked a bit sheepish, huh?
Not such a smart-ass now!
What on earth?
Barracudas!
What dumb asses!
Let's catch our breath.
What was that?
So that's one fridge...
- Who said that?
- Who is it?
Me.
Are you buying the sofa too?
No. I already have one.
Take your time.
I've plenty of stuff.
- All ofit.
- What's that?
Designer suites.
Fitted kitchens.
Stereo systems.
Cordless phones.
Pearl fountains.
Sweet Jesus!
Lovely!
They're real pearls, too.
I've never sold one.
- Do you sell rifles?
- Sure.
What about arrows?
- Yes. I'll get some.
- Stop!
We don't have time.
We have to get our walls back.
Wait. At least buy something.
How much is that pearl thingy?
- Ace.
- Who wants a waffle?
My turn to play...
Look!
What is it?
It's snowing.
Get the door, Gerard.
Yo ho ho!
Santa Claus!
Yep, it's me.
I have a problem...
I was on my rounds in my sleigh
and I had an accident.
- No?
- Yes!
I'll show you.
Right here.
Look.
Your gifts fell down this hole.
That's awful, Santa.
We'll get them out.
Cowboy! Indian!
- Now!
- Go on, Indian.
Plug the fish in, Cowboy!
Well done, Horse!
Our house!
It's in pieces.
Scumbags!
- Faster!
- Take that!
Wait for me!
Faster!
Daylight! Quick!
Wait up, Indian!
It's the farm!
Quick, the doors!
They're here!
Get the bricks!
Let's go, Cowboy!
God Almighty!
Faster, boys!
What the hell's going on?
You're all nuts!
You've blocked up my pond!
What are all these bricks?
Get rid of them this instant!
- What is it, Janine?
- Help!
Monsters!
- Gerard!
- It's our house now!
Who are they?
My door! My floor!
Where are they?
Hold on, I'll be back.
Help! It stinks in here!
Thank you.
- Thanks, Donkey.
- Thanks a lot.
What are you doing on my tractor?
I was only trying to help.
What's all this?
Out of there, you fish!
- Who wants a waffle?
- Ace.
They all need to be eaten.
They're all mad!
This is war!
Higher!
Jump!
To the house!
Upstairs!
Watch out!
My tractor's been hit!
It's the wheel!
My poor farm!
Mrs. Longray, it's Horse.
About time.
Are you okay, Horse?
What happened?
The piano classes...
Jacqueline, sorry I'm late.
Never mind.
I'm just glad to seeyou.
Horse, you are hereby expelled
from this music school!
It's a mess everwyhere!
- No!
- It's all destroyed.
Steven, our house!
- My police box.
- What a disaster!
- Hey, look!
- Wait for me!
I found the broom.
Now we can tidy up!
Let's go!
Come on then.
Be brave.
ONE YEAR LATER
- Hello, Policeman.
- Hello, Postman. No mail?
I knew it.
Come on, animals, move along!
The weather's fine.
Let's get moving.
- Good God, a cow cut in two!
- How terrible!
- We can't leave it.
- We'll stick it together.
Let's get going!
- It worked like a charm, Cowboy!
- Super!
My tractor!
Cowboy! Indian! You bastards!
This way!
Hold on tight, Indian.
Open the hatch, Goat.
Roger, Janine.
Okay, cows, jump!
Faster, faster!
Where did all these cows come from?
- Steven!
- Got you, you thieves!
We just wanted to go for a ride.
The department store is on fire,
Hurry, I'm trapped,
That's not a real fire.
Happy birthday, Horse!
Jacqueline...
Big boy...
Happy birthday, Horse!
Well I never!
You had me fooled there!
Great tunes. I feel like dancing.
So do I, my darling.
Yikes, it's Horse's birthday!
Quick, the gift!
Hang on, Cowboy.
- Hurry up!
- Wait for me!
He'll love this.
Push, Indian.
Push!
This thing's so heavy!
It's stuck. What now?
I've an idea.
Cowboy... not that!
Where's it gone?
Oh no, not that!
Lucky it fell in water.
For sure.
Didn't I say
we should've bought him a cap?
It's lovely!
Fantastic!
The blue one!
