I'm sorry to keep you
waiting. I'm Officer Soto.
Was there anybody else in the house
apart from your wife and daughter?
I never said I had a daughter.
- (DOOR OPENS)
- Oh, sorry, Cody, I thought...
(SCREAMS)
Shit!
Why is the Ombello Group
targeting federal accountants?
Maybe they uncovered
something about Ombello.
We have a problem.
They taught me how to do
this on the towelheads.
And here I am doing
it to one of our own.
American hero no less.
The whole fucking restaurant!
They're saying over 30 people dead.
Who planted the bomb? Was it you?
No.
Let me tell you something
about these people.
The minute you come
to them with a problem,
you are the problem.
Maybe Nicholas Brady is
not who he says he is.
What did they do with Phan?
The girls are guinea pigs.
It's a clinical trial!
Ombello runs it. The
government is funding it!
Thanks a lot Officer, uh, Parvey, huh?
Drive safe.
Who's that?
He's a cop that pulled me
over on the way to Cardello's.
Hi. Nicholas Brady, please.
The road's closed, ma'am.
You're gonna have to turn around.
- What's going on?
- There's been a mugging.
She's dead, Ethan.
Regan's dead.
They killed her.

ANNOUNCER: Bus 1034, bus 1034
to Dillon Beach. Now boarding.
What was the last
thing Regan said to you?
She said she met a friend of hers,
this US Attorney, Paul Rainsford.
Hmm.
That they had uncovered something
and that she needed
to tell me in person.
That's it.
I got to go see him.
I need to find out what they know.
Hey, Clea, what if he got her killed?
But Regan already had the
information when she called.
So why would he tell her
anything if he was with them?
All right. I wanna come with you.
To the US Attorney's Office?
Listen I'm the one who got
her in this fucking mess.
Yeah, you are. And you
have to live with that.
And I'm the one who persuaded
her to go after Brady.
So that's on me.
We're gonna nail these
fuckers to the wall.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
This is the same Assistant DA
that was working on the case
to get the chip out of that girl's head.
Now why the fuck was
I on her radar at all?
Nicholas, calm down.
Don't fucking tell me to calm down!
I'll calm down when I
fucking well want to!
Now why don't you do
something a little more useful
and explain to me how
the fuck this happened?
Faulkner was a hiccup.
She's been handled.
Went down as a mugging.
Because I handled it.
Oh. A little blood on the
hands is good for the soul.
Don't ever put me in
that position again.
And what about Ben Olson?
Handled.
- And his house?
- Spotless.
You could invite your mother
to eat off the kitchen floor.
I wouldn't invite my
mother to eat anywhere.
The only thing left is Kelly.
He will be found resisting arrest
and that will be the end of it.
No more keeping me in the dark.
And no more fucking surprises.
No more surprises.
SLEADER: All right, everybody listen up.
We will be extending
the FBI every cooperation
in the search for Ethan Kelly.
Everything else goes on
the back burner. Understood?
- POLICEWOMAN: Yes, sir.
- (ALL AGREEING)
SLEADER: Where's Annou?
Uh, family.
Her dad okay?
You'd have to ask her, sir.
Tried.
Not answering her phone.
You tell Annou if she wants a job
past Friday to get her butt in here.
Road blocks have been
set up around the city.
Ports and airports are on alert.
Authorities say they believe
Kelly is still in the Bay Area.
MALE REPORTER: He is considered
to be armed and dangerous.
Police have warned the public
that if he is sighted...
(POLICE SIRENS BLARING IN DISTANCE)
We checked local hospitals, morgues.
Dr. Everett hasn't showed
up at work, nor at home.
Assume he's a loss.
We have to discredit
him. Start a paper trail
of titty bars, casinos,
you know the drill.
On it.
Where are we on
Detective Annou's vehicle?
We found that, yet?
- We're working on it.
- Work harder.
She's a cop. She knows
which tolls to avoid,
red light cameras not to go through.
You don't want to report
the car as stolen...
No, I don't want all
of SFPD looking for it.
Just our people.
How did things go with Brady?
I didn't tell him
about Annou or Everett.
I don't need to be taking
him problems right now.
You know how to handle him.
Let me be clear. (SMACKS LIPS)
This is not just me anymore.
If we don't get this under control,
it's all our heads.
(BEEPS)
(BEEPS)
Hi.
And you are?
Detective Clea Annou.
If you're here on the
Rassini fraud case,
I'll tell you what I
tell every detective
who tries to talk to
me outside of court.
I don't speak without a
court reporter present. So...
Actually, I'm here about Regan Faulkner.
What happened to Regan was, uh...
Tragic but not a mugging.
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
Officer Mark Parvey.
I've got eyes on
Detective Annou's vehicle.
Bring her in.
No fuss.
When I met Regan, she
had just finished Harvard.
She was, uh, clerking with Judge Maples.
Here I was this big litigation
associate at Fordam Young.
Or so I thought.
We were both at the same
watering hole one night,
and, uh, I sent her and her
friend an expensive round of Scotch
along with my number.
I figured here was this young ingenue.
She probably didn't know
how to write a brief,
let alone find the courthouse.
Boy, was I wrong.
Did she call you?
(SCOFFS) Oh, yeah, she called.
Three months later to ask a favor.
(LAUGHS)
I don't mind telling
you that I was, uh...
more than a little in love with her.
Whatever you guys found
out about Nicholas Brady,
I think it got her killed.
Don't you wanna find
out who did this to her?
What kind of question is that?
Tell me what you found out.
We didn't find anything
out. We speculated.
Speculated what?
Nicholas Brady had been in Libya.
- So?
- During the revolution,
right before Gaddafi was killed.
No US official went anywhere
near Tripoli at that time,
unless they were...
CIA.
We didn't tell anyone.
Regan must have tipped off somebody,
that she knew about Brady.
But even then, so you
know someone's CIA cover,
you don't get killed for that.
Not in the real world, not these days.
Fuck.
Detective Annou...
I'm responding to an
APB on your vehicle.
I wasn't aware.
It's totally precautionary.
We're talking to anyone who's
worked with Regan Faulkner recently.
Your Captain asked us to bring you in.
All right. I'll follow you.
Uh, my orders are
pretty straightforward.
Why don't you leave your car here,
and I'll make sure they don't ticket it.
Okay. Let me just grab my purse.
(SCREAMING)

You fucking bitch!
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(SIGHS)
Hey, Donna.
Jesus! You scared the crap out of me.
(SIGHS)
Two FBI Agents came by the
house. Middle of dinner.
Sorry about that.
Two hours they interrogated me.
What did you tell them?
That you're a son of a bitch.
You're not that kind
of a son of a bitch.
I never, for one moment,
thought you did it.
You hear me, Ethan Kelly?
Thanks, Donna.
Listen, I want to talk
to you about Tommy.
What about him?
Look, he owed a drug dealer money.
And I tried to help him out.
Ethan, is he dead?
Yes.
I tried to get the
people who did it, Donna.
I'm still fucking trying.
All that led to this?
Yeah. It all led to this.
Look, I don't know how
this is gonna end for me.
I don't know if I'm going
to get out of this one.
My bar is worth four million dollars.
It's under the names of Alice and April,
and Spud's little boy, Kyle.
Okay?
There's a man by the
name of Ira Kippelman.
- This his number. Take it.
- (SIGHS)
He's a good man.
He has all the details.
If anything happens to me,
I want you to go to him.
And everything's set up, all right?
Ethan...
Just please, please promise me.
I promise.
I want to talk to you about Ray.
No.
Stop.
(DONNA SIGHS)
I...
have an image of what happened.
How it ended for him.
In my head.
Leave me with that.
Okay.
(DOOR CLOSES)
You got anything for me?
Called the impound yards.
They found Olson's car in Church Street.
Any sign of Olson?
- Not yet.
- Okay.
He shows up, you
will be the first to know.
You check his credit cards?
Haven't been used.
What about his phone?
Nah! The son of a bitch ditched it.
You'll tell them what
I'm doing for you, right?
Yeah, don't worry.
Your loyalty won't go unnoticed.
Now get the hell outta here.
- (SIGHS) Fuck!

Hey, Caesar. It's me.
Listen, I know you
worked late last night.
I didn't want to wake you,
but I borrowed your car.
Deliveries.
Uh, I'll explain later.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
CLEA: It's me.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So...
Regan thought that
Nicholas Brady was CIA.
That's what she was coming to
tell me, but she had no proof.
That makes sense.
How?
Well, when I was doing
private security over there,
the CIA had us doing off-the-book
missions all the time.
I mean, nobody admitted to it,
but we knew it was true.
Okay, so...
So Theresa Archer and Daniel Jameson,
they make their bones
by facilitating the use
of private security forces
in Iraq on behalf of the CIA.
Let's just say the CIA said,
"You know what? We want
to do the same thing.
"We want to do it here in the states."
Right. Except the CIA
can't operate on US soil.
Uh, that's a small
detail they get around
by using Ombello as a fixer.
That would explain
how Ombello gets to do
whatever the fuck they
want and get away with it.
I mean, no one wants to
see them in court, right?
Mmm-mmm.
Look we know
the accountants were auditing
federal agencies, right?
What if the CIA was one of them?
What if they found a link
between the CIA and Ombello?
And that's why they were targeted.
- It's a theory.
- Yeah.
But that's all it is.
The other accountant.
- Was he married?
- Henry Parker?
Yeah. Laura Parker.
Why?
What if Henry had talked
to his wife about his work?
I mean, maybe she knows something.
Can I get you anything?
- Water?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
Henry was my best friend.
We were supposed to be in Cancun.
(SNIFFLES)
It was our 10th.
My sister was all set to
watch Finn, that's our son.
And now I'm planning a funeral.
(SNIFFLES)
Mrs. Parker...
Laura.
Laura, um...
What happen to your husband,
and the Hoover Building,
it's a horrible tragedy.
At least you're not saying,
"I'm sorry for your loss."
I hate that phrase.
Loss? This isn't loss.
It's death. Why don't
we call it what it is?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't...
No, you don't have to apologize.
Laura, did, did Henry ever
talk to you about work?
No.
I'm not good with figures.
He knows that. (CHUCKLES)
Knew that.
The other detectives
asked the same thing.
What did you tell them?
The same thing I'm telling you.
We didn't talked about work.
They kept asking.
They weren't kind like you,
they didn't listen, not really.
(SIGHS)
Do you think it's true
what they are saying?
How do you mean?
Do you think that one
guy blew up the building
all by himself?
Actually, I don't.
I don't think they're
telling us the truth.
That's what Ben said.
Ben...
Olson?
Ben Olson was here?
Laura, I wanna find out
who killed your husband.
If they're not telling us
how it really went down,
I wanna know.
Don't you?
(SIGHS)
I found him hiding out
in Finn's tree house yesterday.
He was acting all crazy
saying they were after him.
Like, sounded like one of
those conspiracy nuts, you know?
At least, I thought he was crazy.
Now I'm not so sure.
What... What did he want?
Money.
To get out of here.
Okay. This is really important.
If he knows who killed your husband,
I need to find him.
Do you have any idea
where he could have gone?
He and Sam had a...
had a vacation rental.
A home they shared with another couple.
Do you know where that is?
Yeah, sure. We went there all the time.
It's near Dillon Beach.
Ben Olson's alive.
I thought you said
they already got to him.
I thought they did.
(ENGINE STARTING)
(DIALING)
Yeah. Hi, uh, I'm calling about, uh,
one of your vacation rentals.
Uh, yeah, Cabin 19.

Oh, it's available now?
Okay, thanks.

I just saved your life.
All right, look, I'm

Okay?
Clea?
Ben, listen to him.
We know that you were the target.
I know what happened to your family.
I know the man who killed them.
He's the same man who
came after me. He's dead.
Look, I'm gonna go into

I'm gonna get my phone.
The proof is on my phone.
Just look at it.
Look at the proof. Right here.
Ben?
Look.
He's dead.
All right?
We're on your side. We believe you.
It's okay.
Just put it down, Ben.
There you go.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
(BETHANY GRUNTING)
Where's Detective Annou?
Don't tell me you don't know.
Fuck you.
You know, your sister Bridgett,
the way she handles herself
on that bike of hers,
really gets me hot.
Maybe Bridgett gets up tomorrow,
goes for her morning
ride down along the 101.
Maybe everything's okay,
or maybe, right around the
point where she hits 110,
the clutch on her Yamaha freezes
- and the engine dies, huh?
- (GASPING)
Maybe it happens tomorrow,
or the next day, or a week from now.
Your parents have
already lost one child.
- What's another? Right? Right?

What do you want?
The next time you speak with Annou,

You got it? (YELLS) You got it?
Yeah. Yeah.
Mmm.
(GASPING)
(DOOR CLOSES)
(SOBBING)
Were you looking into the CIA, Ben?
No.
There goes that theory.
We weren't looking into the CIA per se.
We were looking at
companies overbilling the CIA
to the tune of billions of dollars.
Was Ombello one of those companies?
No.
Shit.
I recognize this guy.
Who?
This guy right here.
He's head of security at Victus Exports.
They make, uh, uniforms.
They're one of the companies
overbilling the CIA.
You remember all the other companies?
Every single one of them.
But I no longer have a
paper trail on any of that
because it all went up in the building.
What about back-ups?
(SCOFFS) No.
We'd just started
digitizing the whole project,
but we didn't have the manpower.
We had budget cuts, so we got behind.
But in any case, we
hadn't found anything.
We were just looking
into an overbilling case.
Hold on. What about tax returns?
Those are online, right?
Yeah.
Anything there might help us?
Oh, I don't know. I mean, maybe,
but we can't get at any of that.
We need someone with
access to federal records.

We thought he might have

they've been taken, Clea.
His wife installed a Nanny cam.
See what we got.
Is there anything on it?
Nah. No. It's nothing.
All right, then.
- Let's get to work. (EXHALES)

BRADY: I thought you had him.
Kelly gave us the slip. (SIGHS)
And tell me I'm hearing this right?
The accountant was seen
with him outside the house?
And you assured me the
accountant was taken care of.
I was told that he was.
One of our operatives lied to us.
(SIGHS)
I wanted to wait on the building.
You pushed it up.
Are you saying this is my fault?
I'm saying when things are rushed,
mistakes get made.
We've been through worse in the past
and we've come through it together.
When?
When actually have we
"been through worse"?
The Badawi affair in Fallujah.
There was a fucking war going on, Terry.
Need I remind you we're not
actually in a war zone right now?
We can't get away with
the same kind of shit.
More's the pity.
Kelly got lucky today.
We only have to be lucky once.
He has to be lucky always.
We say the accountant
was in on it with Kelly.
We paint him as a
disgruntled federal employee.
This was a workplace shooting,
only on a more spectacular scale.
Give the people what they want.
First he killed his wife and daughter.
We'll put their bodies
in the trunk of his car.
Then he blew the building with Kelly.
The accountant and Kelly
will get picked up together.
(CHUCKLES) Let him spout
his conspiracy theories,
no one in their right
mind will believe him.
He's just another truther.
And we get him in lock-up.
He never makes it to trial.
(INHALES)
You're twisted, Theresa.
You're just pissed that you
didn't think of it first.
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHS)
McMillan Combat Incorporated.
The CIA paid them $6,600,000.
McMillan sells military
boots to the agency.
Only 40% of that order
was ever even delivered.
Hah. Our tax dollars at work.
(EXHALES)
Man, I long for the day when the schools
have all the money they need
and the Air Force has to
hold a bake sale for a bomber.
(EXHALES) You got a line item
for a payment made from
McMillan to Ombello,
for $3,960,000
for consultancy services.
Yeah, we knew about that,
but we weren't looking at Ombello.
I mean, there's nothing unusual
about companies hiring
management consultants.
It happens every day all across America.
Which makes for a perfect
way to hide payments.
Add this up, would you, please, Ben?
600,000.
- 700,000.
- Here's another one.
980,000.
400,000.
280,000.
And then I believe we got
an even $1,000,000.
$3,960,000.
Okay.
How much did the CIA pay
McMillan in the fiscal year, Ben?
6,600,000.
So McMillan
delivered 40% of the order,
and then 60% of the fee they receive,
which is $3,960,000,
goes directly into Ombello's pocket.
So if the CIA wants to pay Ombello
for services rendered...
This would be a smart way
to hide it under the radar.
Let's say that this pattern
plays out with the other companies...
We have a shot at proving
that the CIA was passing
money indirectly to Ombello,
but we can't prove
that they knew Ombello was
engaged in criminal activity.
Yeah. Not yet, maybe. Not yet.
Drop your weapon.

Theresa, they're cleaning house.
The way I see it, you
got a couple of options.
You can turn state's evidence,
help us with the case,
and we'll put you in protective custody.
Or you know what?
Maybe we'll just let
them finish the job.
Hmm?
I appreciate the offer,
but I think I'll take my chances.

(KEYPAD BEEPING)
Clea! Cover me!
(GROANS)
Move, move, move!
Fuck!
Oh... (GROANS)
Let's go. Get started. Go, go, go.
How long do you think we have
before they figure out a way in?
(SIGHS)
How do you like your chances now?
(BEEPING)
You figure out a way
to get me out of here,
I'll tell you what you want to know.
I can do that.
(CHUCKLES) How?
All in good time. Ben,
give me your phone.
First, you're going to tell me
everything you know about the CIA,
Ombello, all of it. Start talking.
Now?
- Right fucking now.
- (CHUCKLES)
You ever heard of Yuba, California?
No.
Want to know why you've never
heard of Yuba, California?
Because of me and my people.
Your people who you have kill for you?
(SIGHS) Now see, you say
that like it's a bad thing,
but it depends on who
you kill, don't you think?
15 years back, Nicholas
Brady contacted me
through an operative
that we knew in Basra.
Had a problem.
- What kind of problem?
- There was a cell
in Yuba, California.
FBI couldn't prove it.
They had no probable
cause to arrest anyone.
Shit, they couldn't even get a
warrant to search their houses.
- So you killed them.
- I'm a fixer.
A middle man. Woman.
That's how it started.
Sometimes we're successful.
Other times not. But I'll tell you this,
it's a shame that no
one called my number
before Orlando or San Bernardino.
So that makes you, what, a fucking hero?
I don't think about the killing.
I think about the lives I save.
Ethan knows all about
that, right, Ethan?
If it's a threat, kill it.
It was different over there.
Yes, but they brought
over there over here.
Our government just
doesn't have the balls
to tell the soccer moms
and dental hygienists.
I'm sorry, it's illegal over here
but heroic over there?
That doesn't make sense to me.
Well, maybe the money has
something to do with that?
Why shouldn't I get paid, huh?
This is America.
A good day's work deserves compensation.
You're trafficking girls,
you're distributing drugs,
how does that fit in?
It didn't at first.
But then I realized we had
a small army on speed dial.
And I thought that could be monetized,
and it turns out I was right.
So we started offering our services
to people who could afford it.
People who wanted to protect shipments,
distributions routes.
So the authorities knew about this?
Oh, my God, you're so naive.
The "authorities" encourage it.
Whatever they tell the public,
they know they're never
gonna "win the war on drugs",
or stop trafficking,
so why not take a cut of the inevitable?
Through us, they do.
But money doesn't just flow
from them to us, you see.
It flows from us to them, too.
And they make a lot of money.
And that money goes to
schools and hospitals
and hell, probably even
your paycheck, Detective.
So how do you feel about it now?
Everything else in
this country is taxed,
why should organized crime be exempt?
Theresa Archer.
I'm protected at the highest level.
You're going to get nothing
out of me, so you can ask
all the damn questions you want.
(PHONE RINGING)
- CLEA: Hi.
- Clea?
I'm taking this to Sleader.
No, please don't.
You have to trust me on this, Clea.
He's on our side of
the line, I promise you.
All right, do it.
I've got Clea on the phone.
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?
I've apprehended Ethan Kelly.
I'm under fire. Requesting
immediate backup.

What do you want to do? What do we do?
(OFFICERS ISSUING ORDERS)
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
(GROANS)
Get down!
(GROANS)
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
OFFICER: EMS, right away!
- OFFICER 2: It must be tight!
- EMS on the way.
OFFICER: Hold your fire.
(PHONE RINGS)
Hi. I'm gonna bring him out.
Is it just us on the line?
Just you and me. No one else.
Okay. I need you to come in the house.
I need you to bring four vests.
I have a woman with me by
the name of Theresa Archer.
I need to deliver her
to you and only you.
You must put her into safe custody.
Only use people that you
can trust. Is that clear?
Clear.
As soon as you see her, take her out.
If you get a clean
shot of Kelly, take it.
But Theresa Archer is the prime target.
All right, we're coming out!
- Kelly is surrendering!
- OFFICER: Hold your fire!
He is not resisting. Hold your fire!
He is not resisting!
I can't get a clean shot.
Shoot the detective if you have to.
Take a head shot. Take
the fucking shot now!
Shit. Clea, one o'clock!
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

Mr. Kelly, how do you feel
about being exonerated?
Will you be suing the authorities
- for wrongful arrest?

Well, um, right now I could
use a good leaving alone.
Excuse me.

does it feel to be free?

retired to consider the motion
and returned to the court
just over an hour later,
both to agree to the dismissal
and to formally exonerate
Mr. Kelly of all charges.
Sweetheart, get over here.
Mr. Kelly, how do you feel
about being exonerated?
Will you be suing the authorities
- for wrongful arrest?
- What do you plan to do now?
Well, um, right now I could
use a good leaving alone.
Excuse me.
I told you he was a good kid.
Are you going to go see him?
(CHUCKLES)
You should go see him.
I'm busy, Pops.
(KNOCKING)
Yeah?
Is that the list?
All the potential candidates, sir.
Okay.
Now Ombello is out of
commission, we need to decide
who's going to run
West Coast Operations.
What do you want to
do about Ethan Kelly?
