Shouldn't be much farther
to the cabin, Betty.
Gee, I like this mountain road.
Yes. The scenery certainly
is lovely to look at.
If you like scenery.
Pull up here, why don't
you, and I'll check the map.
- Make sure we're not lost.
- Yeah.
Seriously, Paul, I do
wish this was a vacation.
You could use a break from
all this scientist work.
It's almost as if you've
been doing too much science.
Too much science? Is that possible?
Betty, you know what this
meteor could mean to science.
If we find it, and it's
real, it could mean a lot.
It could mean actual advances
in the field of science.
No, I know. I'm used to it, I guess.
You might say I'm a scientist's wife.
There's a lot in what you say, Betty.
In many ways, it's hard to be a
scientist's wife, the wife of a scientist.
And yet, in other ways,
it's good. Really good.
You always know the right thing
to say, Dr. Paul Armstrong.
There's a farmer up ahead there.
Why don't we ask him directions.
Excuse me. Can you tell us the
way to the old Taylor place?
Sure thing, mister.
Stay on this road here.
Past Dead Man's Curve,
you'll come to a fence...
...called the Devil's Fence.
From there, go on foot...
...till you come to a valley known
as the Cathedral of Lost Soap.
Smack in the center is what they
call Forgetful Milkman's Quadrangle.
Stay right on the Path
of Staring Skulls...
...and you come to a place
called Death Clearing.
Cabin's right there. Can't miss it.
Boy, that doesn't sound too inviting.
Well, lot of folks
superstitious in these parts...
...what with the legend
of Cadavra Cave and all.
Next you'll be telling
us there's monsters.
Quiet day.
I certainly hope someone needs
a forest ranger here sometime.
Hello. I'm Dr. Roger Fleming,
and I seem to have lost my way.
I'm Ranger Brad, and
that's what I'm here for.
You can call me Ranger
Brad. Most folks do.
Yes. Ranger Brad. Of
course. I like that.
Do you think you could tell
me the way to Cadavra Cave?
Cadavra Cave? Why do you wanna go there?
Ranger Brad, do I tell you
all your ranger business?
No, I guess not. Keep going
on this trail about a mile.
You can't miss it.
Thank you, Ranger Brad.
You've been very helpful.
Anytime.
Oh, say.
You don't believe those legends about
the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, do you?
Ranger Brad, I'm a scientist.
I don't believe in anything.
Nice fellow.
Paul, is it much farther?
My legs are already starting to
feel like two heavy, slow things.
Soon I won't feel like I have legs
anymore, they're already so tired.
Shouldn't be too much farther, Betty.
And then you can rest
and I can do science.
What was that about
being a scientist's wife?
Look. They've got the right idea.
This looks like the cabin, all right.
Looks okay from the outside. But
what's the inside like, I wonder.
I think the front's around here.
Oh, Paul, it's everything
I dreamed it'd be.
Is it? Gee, that's wonderful, honey.
What is it, darling?
Oh, I don't know.
As a scientist, I just wish I could
appreciate more things, like...
...cabins, bicycles.
I know. You're too
wrapped up in your work.
That's why you need to get
away from this silly old meteor.
Get away from it? I feel like
I haven't even got near it yet.
This silly old meteor, as you call
it, could be made of atmosphereum.
Do you know what that
could mean for mankind?
Oh, tell you what, Betty, once
my meteor studying is done...
...what say you and
I take some time off...
...take the boat out on the
lake, just the two of us?
- Oh, Paul, do you really mean it?
- Scientist's honor.
Wait a minute. We don't have a boat.
- Oh, you.
- I want you to know...
...if we did have a boat, you'd be the
first person I'd take out on it, kitten.
Dinner was delicious, honey.
Keep cooking like that and I won't
be able to move, let alone do science.
That'd suit me fine, Mr. Meteor.
Ouch, that hurt. Tomorrow, what
say you and I go searching...
...for our rocky, glowing,
radioactive friend from space together?
Paul Armstrong, I do believe
there's hope for you yet.
Shake on it?
Why shake when we can touch
other things? Like lips.
Oh, Paul, could that be your meteor?
My meteor's already landed, honey.
That'd be scientifically impossible.
Right. Who ever heard of a
meteor going back to space?
There must be another meteor altogether.
I wonder.
I also wonder.
Now, see here. What's got
my cows all-fired riled?
It's okay, Bossy, I'm here now.
There, there, Bossy. There, there.
No. No. You're not
Bossy. You're not Bossy.
Well, time to find a meteor.
Looks like a perfect day for hunting
space rocks, wouldn't you say, Betty?
Oh, Paul, I'm frightened.
What is it, darling?
What's the matter? Tell me.
I don't know.
Nothing I can put my finger on.
Not something I can
see or touch or feel...
...but something I can't
quite see or touch or feel...
...or put my finger on.
- Oh, well. Shall we find that meteor?
- Yes, of course.
According to my map, Cadavra Cave
should be around here somewhere.
Any readings, as you call them?
Nothing yet. According
to my calculations...
...the meteor must have
crashed right around here.
And that machine, or whatever
it is, will tell you where?
Yes, it's tuned to
detect atmosphereum...
...which is what I'm convinced
the meteor was made of.
lncredible.
Either that's a reading
or my teeth chattering.
We've picked up something
that's not teeth. That's strange.
I hope it doesn't mean
one of us ate atmosphereum.
This is serious. The readings are
getting stronger, but we're not moving.
But something else is moving,
and it's moving right for us.
Whatever it is, it's
gone now. You all right?
I think so.
Whatever was watching
us seemed pretty big.
Worse than that, Betty.
Whatever it was, it's
lousy with atmosphereum.
This is it. This has to be it.
Cadavra Cave.
It's you, isn't it? It's really you.
At last, the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
And this little find, this pile of
old bones, as some would call it...
...will make me, Dr. Roger Fleming...
...the most powerful man in the world.
It is safe, she who is my wife.
You may come out now.
Are you certain, Kro-bar, my husband?
This world is strange
to us, even different.
Yes, it is different, this
Earth, as it is called.
But then, are we of the planet
Marva, as we call our planet...
...not also strange and different
to this planet and its people also?
You think the Earth people
think we are strange, you think?
It is strange how the ways of people
on different planets differ, is it not?
Marva. Earth. Marva. Earth.
I see what you mean.
Oh, well. Come. Let us
ready the preparations.
I'll get the things we
need to repair our ship...
...which is broken, in the crash
on this alien planet that we had.
You know, it's funny...
...but in a strange way, I
could feel almost at home here.
- Oh, well. -
Kro-bar. Kro-bar!
The Mutant. It's gone.
But how can this be? Was
not the Mutant cage sealed?
Oh, yes, I swear it was, my husband.
And the Mutant lock was secured.
Maybe the special bars on the
Mutant cage got bent in the crash.
Oh, this is fine. Fine. Now we
must not only repair our ship...
...we must find our Mutant, which we
were to return to our planet, Marva.
Or who knows how many untold
millions will die by its hand.
If only it did have hands, my woman.
If only it did have hands.
Oh, why isn't it working?
Why are you not coming
to life, my Skeleton? Why?
Have I wronged you in some way?
You're against me, aren't
you? Of course you are.
All skeletons are against
me. They always have been.
Even when I was a child,
I was hated by skeletons.
Stop your blubbering, mortal fool.
Who is it? Who are you? Show yourself.
Who do you think it is, idiot? It
is I, the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
- Then you are alive!
- That is how stupid you are.
Only my skeleton brain lives. The
rest of me is still just lifeless bone.
But there is a way to bring
me completely back to life.
What is it? You have but to say
it, O Skeleton, and I will do it.
There is a radioactive
element known as atmosphereum.
- You must find this and bring it to me.
- I will.
I'll find atmosphereum
and bring it to you.
That's what I just suggested.
When I am brought to life...
...together, you and I will
rule the world together.
But how? How will I find it?
That is for you to know. That's
not my problem. I sleep now.
No. No, tell me where it is.
Skeleton? Skeleton?
Where? Where can I
find this atmosphereum?
That's it, Paul. You've found it.
Yes. This meteor will be the world's
greatest source of atmosphereum.
Look at it glow. It's
almost lulling, in a way.
Careful, don't fall in
love with that stuff.
That atmosphereum can do
some mighty powerful things.
Can I believe the luck?
Atmosphereum under my very nose.
If it were a woman, it could kiss me.
Hold on, my Skeleton.
For soon you shall
have life. Sweet life.
Is it so hopeless, my Kro-bar?
Lattis, I fear our power source...
...the power that runs
this ship, is gone.
Without it, I fear we have no hope of
ever seeing Marva, our planet, again.
Then we must find the power source.
Yes. We must hope that
this planet, this Earth...
...contains that rarest of all
radioactive elements: atmosphereum.
Oh, well. Meantime, I
will hunt for the Mutant...
...with this transmutatron.
I only hope it didn't kill
already while it roamed last night.
Leave me now.
Our Mutant must be
around here somewhere.
When I find it, our transmutatron will
change it to a more harmless creature.
That might be the Mutant now.
With this atmosphereum, Betty,
mankind can benefit in many ways...
- ...many of them good.
- I know.
Kro-bar!
Kro-bar!
What is it? You need not
yell, because of my proximity.
I yell not from the volume required
by great distance, but from excitement.
- Two Earth people- -
There are many Earth people.
Speak specifically. What's special
about these two that warrants interest?
- Surely nothing.
- These two, as you call them...
...have atmosphereum.
I hope the owners don't mind their
dishes holding a radioactive meteor.
Don't eat the meteor by
mistake, whatever you do.
Seriously, we'll clean
the dishes before we go.
- Oh, Paul, it's so exciting.
- I know.
I've got to get that
meteor. But how? How?
There must be a way inside that cabin.
Think. Think.
Cabin. Cabin. Cabin.
What's that?
Good work, Lattis.
The human whereabouter has led
us right to where the humans are.
Evidently, these beings like
primitive, almost rustic structures.
How foolish they are.
Aliens, from outer space.
Careful, my love, for we must
seem to like such things now...
...like this foolish
structure and all things human.
I catch on, my Kro-bar. Almost
as if we were pretending.
Pretending. I like the way
you put things, my queen.
Mysterious, and yet still
perfectly understandable.
Oh, well, we waste time on
amusement. On with the pretending.
Thanks to the transmutatron, we will
look exactly like the human beings.
How strange these beings be.
This neck restrainer
is most uncomfortable...
- ...and what function must it serve?
- I don't know, my husband.
I am strangely drawn to
this inverted cloth funnel...
...and its wonderful softness.
Careful, Lattis. You may
grow to like being human.
My husband would joke with me.
Come. Go. The atmosphereum awaits.
We cannot take the transmutatron in with
us. It would be difficult to explain.
We'll leave it here in case the Mutant
comes, so we can render it harmless.
What are they, Kro-bar?
A series of small buildings
leading up to the main one.
And what are we to do?
Step on them until we
are high enough to enter.
Well, darling, have you
made science history yet?
If you keep distracting me, I'll
never change the course of mankind.
Well, maybe we can do
that without atmosphereum.
- Who can that be?
- Someone who's an interrupter.
This appears to be an
entrance of some sort.
Then why isn't it opening, my love?
- Oh, I'm scared.
- This is insane.
This makes no sense, I tell you.
Why is this happening?
Why is this happening?
Calm, Lattis. There must be some
explanation. There has to be.
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Why doesn't this entrance open?
They'll know. They'll
know everything now.
What can we do? What can we
do to make this entrance open?
- Hello.
- Hello.
There is a way in. I knew it.
Can we help you?
- You would help us?
- I don't understand.
Oh, you must be the Taylors. Of course.
These are the people
that rented us the cabin.
- They said they might stop up.
- How are you? I'm Dr. Paul Armstrong.
This is my wife, Betty.
We didn't catch your first names.
Our first names are the names that
were given us first, obviously.
Well, what shall we call you?
Oh, our Earth names. I am Tergasso...
- ...and this
is- - I am Bammon.
Tergasso, Bammon, won't you come in?
- Yes, we have been desiring that.
- Finally we go in.
Won't you make yourselves comfortable?
I'm not sure. How would one
go about finding that out?
- Please, please, be seated.
- Fold yourself in the middle.
Can we get you anything?
A drink, perhaps?
Yes, liquid, please.
A man who gets right to
the point. I like that.
How about four Scotch and sodas?
My, that's a lovely dress, Tergasso.
Yes. Yes, I, too, thought this.
I almost felt it somehow.
That is what I told Kro-bar.
Who's Kro-bar?
- Is he the designer? - Yes.
Yes, Kro-bar is the designer.
Well, you're going to have to
tell me where their store is.
My wife does not like
to talk about a store.
We are just like you,
really, I assure you.
Yes, I also appreciate your
soft cloth funnel, Betty.
Four drinks, coming up.
Here's to one heck of a beautiful cabin.
- Tergasso certainly was thirsty.
- Who?
I'll seem suspicious if I come alone.
I know.
Those forest animals standing
right there have given me an idea.
I watched the aliens work this thing.
Maybe if I make myself a
date, I won't seem so alone.
I never thought I'd have
a date with an animal.
Relax, my pet. I am your friend.
More than a friend, I
suppose, since I created you.
But I must give you a name.
To us, you and l, you shall be Animala.
I find that name appropriate somehow.
But to the others, to those inferior
to you and I, you shall be...
...Pammy.
So, Bammon, what do you do?
Do? I can do anything.
I have no restrictions.
That's the spirit. I'm
the same way with science.
I like my dress so very
much. That's what I can do.
This drink is very refreshing.
Thank you, Paul and Betty.
Oh, not at all.
I have an overwhelming
desire to participate...
...in the purchasing
of many cloth funnels...
...some I can't even
spare the expense for.
Is that so very wrong?
Oh, shopping. Yes. No. No, not at
all. Shopping isn't wrong at all...
...especially for a woman.
Sometimes I wish it were. Right, Bammon?
I wouldn't know about that, Paul.
Shopping can be loads of fun.
With a little restraint, of course.
Gee, thanks, honey.
Obviously there is much
humor in what you say.
In Paul's line of work,
he can use a good laugh.
It can be so deadly boring sometimes.
Even I admit that.
Well, as long as everything
is perfectly normal.
I certainly am a normal Earth woman.
Isn't that right, my little space comet?
Stop that! My love.
My wife sometimes forgets
she is not a space alien.
Won't you please be seated, my dear?
May I say you look lovely this evening?
In English, my dear.
Thank you so very much.
- Would you care for a cocktail?
- Yes, please.
No, no, no. Drink like I showed you.
Tip, tip, tip.
And again. Tip, tip, tip.
There.
- Very well-done, my dear.
- Very well-done, my dear.
Yes, I'm afraid I'm not at
liberty to discuss my work...
...Bam- Bannon-
Bam- Bammon.
Oh, that is unfortunate, Paul.
I like work very much.
I'm very interested in it.
That's a very healthy attitude, Bam.
If more Americans thought like that...
...a lot more work would sure get done.
- Do you like to cook, Tergasso?
- I...
I don't really know.
- I'll get it. This is a day for visitors.
- I wouldn't know, Paul.
Good evening.
My name is Rudolph Yaber, and
this is my wife, Pammy Yaber.
Our car broke down, and I fear, I'm
afraid, we're dreadfully lost, I'm afraid.
- Isn't that right, my dear?
- Always agree.
Come in. We've plenty of room.
You're welcome to stay the night.
I'm Dr. Paul Armstrong
and this is Bammon Taylor.
Hello.
I couldn't help overhearing.
I'm Betty Armstrong and
this is Tergasso Taylor.
- Hello.
- Won't you join us for dinner?
My charming wife and
I would be delighted.
Thank you.
After the eating is done, I
must look for the atmosphereum.
How do we know their eating customs?
Do exactly as they do, Lattis, and
we cannot fail to convince them.
Tip, tip, tip.
Tip, tip, tip.
This meal looks quite delightful, Betty.
Oh, it's just something I
threw together, that's all.
Well, shall we dig in?
Everyone's so hungry.
I think somebody ate too fast.
No. No, my Pammy is very
attuned to the ways of nature.
She must have pretty good hearing.
Let's go see what it is. Just
the men go. You ladies stay here.
Bammon, will you join us?
Unless there's something
we should know about.
No. You know everything. I will go also.
I hope it's nothing too dangerous.
Careful. It could be a mutant.
Sorry, folks, I didn't mean to
startle you. I'm Ranger Brad.
Thank goodness it's only
a forest ranger, honey.
Hi, I'm Dr. Paul Armstrong.
The meteor specialist?
Say, this is an honor.
Oh, hello, Dr. Fleming.
I see we meet again.
- Dr. Fleming?
- Oh, just an old nickname of mine.
I'm really Rudolph Yaber.
And this is my wife, Pammy.
She's lost her purse again.
We'll find it later,
sweetheart. All right?
Crumbs.
- Please, won't you have a seat?
- I don't mind sitting sometimes.
Now.
Say, I didn't know anyone was
staying at the old Taylor place.
Yes, we are. Oh, and here's
the Taylors, right here.
The Taylors? I recall
they were older folks.
We are a younger version.
Say, I didn't know the Taylors
had any kids. That's swell.
I don't wanna frighten you folks...
...but a farmer nearby
was horribly mutilated.
I thought I should tell other
folks, like yourselves...
...so that maybe, just maybe, you
wouldn't be horribly mutilated too.
Well, I've certainly never been horribly
mutilated, but I don't wanna start now.
This certainly throws
a damper on the evening.
I didn't mean to throw a damper.
Believe me, that's the last
thing I'd like to throw.
I don't wanna throw anything at
all, but when folks are mutilated...
...I feel it's my job to tell others.
We take our horrible mutilations
seriously up in these parts.
I'm sure you do.
Honey, the ranger's just doing his job.
Of course he is. I'm sorry, Ranger Brad.
I guess all this talk of horrible
mutilation has me on edge.
That's all right, Dr. Armstrong.
This horrible mutilation has a whole
lot of people on a whole lot of edges.
Well, if there's no more talk for
us now, I guess I'll be on my way.
I'll see you to the door.
Tell me, ranger, any idea
what might've caused...
...this horrible
mutilation, as you call it?
Oh, probably nothing to worry
about. Could be a bear, I suppose.
Can a bear do that? I
mean, horribly mutilate?
Dr. Armstrong...
...in my time, I guess
I've seen bears...
...do some things that
even a bear wouldn't do.
Well, good night.
Nice meeting you, Mrs. Yaber.
Mutilate. Mutant.
I wonder.
Oh, well.
Oh, well. Better get home.
Say, I must be crazy, walking out
in these woods alone at night...
...with a horrible mutilation
practically around the corner.
Oh, well.
What a night. Glad I
don't believe in things.
What's that?
This is crazy.
Things like this just don't happen.
Noises?
Noises in the woods?
Stay away. Stay away!
What's that? What's that?
No. No!
Goodness.
- What in heaven's name was that?
- Sounded like an Earth scream.
It's too late. There's
nothing you can do for him now.
I might be just a
test-tube-tipping lab jockey...
...who's looked at too many
shiny rocks for far too long...
...but something tells me you know
more about this than you're letting on.
No, Paul Armstrong. I know
only what my ears tell me.
- And what my eyes see me.
- Now, wait a second.
Surely you don't believe those legends
about the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
Surely those are old wives' tales.
And believe me, I've
known plenty of old wives.
Seriously, Bammon, is that what
you're suggesting? A living skeleton?
Did I say that? Did I say
anything about a skeleton?
No one mentioned a skeleton.
Why, we don't even know about skeletons.
My husband spoke not of skeletons but
of another, more different thing...
...which he was speaking of.
Which he and I know and you do not.
Animala.
Animala.
Skeleton. Skeleton.
Animala.
<i>You must find the atmosphereum.</i>
Stop it. Stop it!
What are you doing? She can't help you.
You must find the atmosphereum.
Amish terrarium. Must
find Amish terrarium.
I don't understand. Why does
she need an Amish terrarium?
Don't the Amish live
in open air, like us?
Of course, Betty. It's absurd.
Putting the Amish in glass
cases would be inhumane.
Surely Pammy doesn't
realize what she's saying.
Obey me! Obey me or I'll-
You fool. You skinny, bony jackass!
Stop it or you'll spoil
everything! I will get the-
Amish terrarium myself.
I cannot wait so long.
<i>She. She will help me,
the housewifely one.</i>
Hi, Betty. It's I, the Skeleton.
<i>Fetch the meteor,
Betty. Fetch the meteor.</i>
The Betty one looks
drowsy. Now is the time...
- ...to exert Marvan
mind-power on her. - Very well.
I must go to bed and
make some coffee now.
Darling, what are you saying?
I don't think I understand.
How can you make
coffee if you're in bed?
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
<i>Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.</i>
<i>Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.</i>
<i>Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.</i>
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
<i>Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.</i>
<i>Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.</i>
Bring the meteor to the Skeleton.
<i>Bring the atmosphereum
to Kro-bar and Lattis.</i>
I must make the Skeleton meatier
using a crowbar covered in lettuce.
Darling, please, you're
not making any sense.
Betty.
Betty, what are you doing?
What I should've done
a long time ago, Paul.
- What are you saying?
- Leave her, Paul.
It's dangerous to wake a sleepwalker.
Sleepwalker? She hasn't even
gone to bed yet, Rudolph. Betty.
Betty, you little fool, where
are you bringing that to?
Betty.
Betty!
Where
-?
Where am I?
What happened?
It's all right, Betty. You were
just doing some very stupid things.
It's all over now. Don't
move or try to do anything.
All right if I breathe?
- Seriously, Paul. What came over me?
- I was hoping you could tell me.
It was...
...so strange.
All I know is I had an overwhelming
desire to take the meteor.
Anything else?
Just vague things.
Strange.
A skull was smiling at me.
And something alien.
Like another brain...
...in my own head.
That doesn't make any
sense. Brains, head-
First of all, skulls
don't smile, they're dead.
And it's more of a grin, really.
Believe me, I know. As a scientist,
I've looked plenty of skulls...
...in the socket in my
time. Not a pretty sight.
- Oh, Paul, what can it mean?
- I don't know.
But as a precaution, I'm
putting that meteor...
...in a drawer where
even you can't find it.
- Oh, Paul- -
I'm sorry, Betty.
But until you can explain to me what
you mean by "brains" and "head"...
...even you can't be trusted.
Not until you're yourself again, kitten.
The only one I want in that
pretty little head of yours is me.
- Oh, Paul.
- Now, never mind "Oh, Paul."
It's gonna be all right. You'll see.
Oh, Paul.
Don't think I don't know who you are.
Pray, do not seek to tell us
what we do and do not think.
You are different from the other humans.
More disgusting, I think.
If "disgusting" means smart
and ambitious on your planet...
...l would agree wholeheartedly.
I would hardly expect
aliens such as yourselves...
...to have a full grasp
of the English language.
Aliens? Us? Is this
one of your Earth jokes?
See? See?
You should not have said "Earth jokes."
Don't you see how that gave us away?
Very well, clever brain,
you have found us out.
- What do you intend to do?
- Do?
Do?
Absolutely nothing.
Nothing?
It seems we are working to
a similar purpose, you and I.
And that purpose is...
...atmosphereum.
So you know.
Yes. For, you see, I also
need this atmosphereum...
...for my very own reasons.
Then surely there is
enough for both of us.
That's what I'm thinking. We
shall share the atmosphereum.
If you help us and we help you...
Why, of course. We'll
be helping each other.
Almost like an alliance.
You could say that.
As if we were actually working together.
Atmosphereum for me...
...atmosphereum for you.
Some for you and some for us.
Each of us would have it.
We will "split it," I suppose
your Earth slang would say.
Very good, Tergasso. You
learn our ways quickly.
This way, neither of us
will lack for atmosphereum.
- Of course.
- You two catch on quickly.
I can see I've chosen
my partners wisely.
Yes. Yes, we would be
partners, wouldn't we?
Partners who share.
"Partners who share." I like that.
I like the way aliens think.
You Earth fools are not so lacking...
...in the "thinking and then
being triumphant" area also.
Not at all. In fact, I would
say you rather excel in it.
How do we get the meteor?
Well, I see the brainy types are
up bright and early this morning.
They say that's the best time
to look at little, glowing rocks.
What the
-?
Sorry, I must've been really involved
in my scientific work for a minute.
I guess that's what they mean...
...when they say scientists
have rocks in their heads.
Thanks to science, we're finally
starting to understand atmosphereum.
Did you know there's enough
atmosphereum in one teaspoon...
...to go to the moon and back six times?
Moon, teaspoons. That's all
gibberish to me, I'm afraid.
As long as I don't have to
go to the kitchen six times...
- ...to tell you breakfast is ready.
- Okay.
Speaking of early risers, where have
our unexpected guests gotten off to?
- They certainly are odd ducks.
- You know, I don't know.
Something about hiking
or exploring or something.
Oh, well.
Well, just as long as they don't
hike too far and fall off a cliff.
- That would be a hike.
- You said it.
Now, let's see what happens
when I add water to it.
Good, old-fashioned H2O, I call it.
Oh, hello, Pammy. I
didn't see you come in.
How come you're not out
hiking with the others?
I don't have answers, Paul.
Paul.
You've probably seen plenty of woods.
- You seem like the outdoor type.
- Always agree.
You can watch me experiment,
if you promise to be quiet.
Be quiet.
Well, I don't mean stop breathing...
...but don't exactly do
a big dance number, either.
Now, that's almost exactly the kind
of thing I was saying you shouldn't do.
Seriously, Pammy, I don't know if I can
do science with you dancing like that.
Please stop.
Quit it, Pammy, quit it.
Don't make me bring my wife
in here. She can be a real-
Animala. Dance with Animala.
Rock dance. Do the rock dance.
All right, Mr. Shiny Rocks, breakfast.
Paul?
That's funny.
Paul.
Paul.
Now, where could he have gone?
Not another meteor.
Paul.
Rock dance, Pauly, do
the rock dance. Oh, yeah.
Paul?
Paul.
Paul.
Where are you, for goodness' sakes?
Come, Animala. That's my pet.
Is she not special, this one?
She is truly special, this Earth woman.
Or should I say animal?
It's hard to decide.
Yes, it is. Since she's
made from forest animals.
She must teach me this dance, but
later. Now there is much to be done.
That's good, Animala, my
pet. Stop him right there.
Now take the box and give it to me.
Excellent. Let the sharing begin.
- The Mutant! It must have Betty.
- No matter.
There are more important
things to settle.
Now, Skeleton!
Freeze where you are,
Lattis and Kro-bar.
Not moving very fast now, are
you, my interplanetary friends?
- So this is your idea of sharing.
- It's not like Marvan sharing at all.
This must be Earth sharing.
You'll find much of Earth
sharing works this way.
It's really more like
I'm sharing with myself.
If I could only reach
you, we'd share pain.
Sorry, I'd love to stay, but I
have a skeleton to bring to life.
That would be me.
And I cannot spare the atmosphereum.
Animala?
Animala, come. Come, Animala.
What are you doing?
Anyone get the number of
the rocket that clobbered me?
Speaking of rockets!
Holy moly!
There's no time to explain
now, Paul. The Mutant has Betty.
Please, get these ropes
off me. Take them off now!
- There are no ropes.
- My wife panics.
These ropes are mental.
I think it's a skeleton or something.
That's crazy. Skeletons
can't mentally hold anyone.
I sleep now.
Gee, I guess they can.
Would someone mind telling me what
the heck's going on around here?
The Mutant's got Betty. We're aliens.
Slow down. I'm a scientist,
and that was still fast.
We had a mutant. It
got loose. It has Betty.
Hey, one at a time. I'm
gonna get whiplash here.
Now, suppose you start
at the beginning...
...and tell me what happened
before I get a headache.
We are from the planet
Marva. We crashed here.
Planet? Marva? You're gonna have
to do a lot better than that...
...if you want my help.
Just suppose you take a deep breath,
relax and tell me all about it.
The universe is a very large place.
Soon, very soon, we'll be...
...at Cadavra Cave, my love.
Then you'll see.
Your eyes will behold the
wonder of the Skeleton.
Skeleton.
And so you can well understand
the need for urgency.
I certainly can. No
wonder you were excited.
But there's one thing
I don't understand...
...and that's why you
tried to take the meteor.
I'm certain there's
enough atmosphereum...
...to power your ship and still have
enough left for me to do science with.
You mean you would share
the atmosphereum with us?
Kro-bar. This water on my cheeks.
I have never felt it before.
Oh, what a strange and
wondrous thing it is, surely.
I, too, am feeling this new
sensation of Earth weeping.
- Something very alien to Marva.
- Oh, yes.
We gave up weeping eons ago.
Kro-bar, maybe this is one advance
even science couldn't make for you.
The advance of emotional expression.
Though it isn't considered very manly.
There'll be time enough
for weeping later.
Right now your mate is-
Betty!
Skeleton? Hello, my Skeleton.
I brought you back a present.
It's a rock. It glows.
Hello, Skeleton.
Who wakes the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra?
Oh, it's you. The stupid one.
Oh, you'll like me better
now. A whole lot better.
Shut up. Stop that giggling.
It makes me uncomfortable.
We have much work to
be done. Hello, Animala.
What happened to me?
Betty. Betty, it's all right now.
It's
- It's me, Paul. Dr. Paul Armstrong, your husband.
Oh, Paul.
There, there. It's all right
now. You're among friends now.
Alien friends.
Aliens?
- My God! Where am I?
- It's all right, Betty.
- You're just in a spaceship now.
- Yes, Betty, it's just like your house.
Only, it travels through space.
Please, Betty, try and remember
what happened. I know it's painful.
Oh, it was horrible.
Horrible.
Betty. Betty, it's all
right now. Calm yourself.
Please, Mrs. Armstrong, there
are delicate instruments aboard.
I
- I remember...
...it came out of nowhere.
It was huge. It had-
It was so ugly.
I must've fainted, and
the next thing I know...
...it was carrying me.
Like I was a child.
A small child.
And it looked at me...
...with those eyes, those ugly eyes...
...and they looked deep into me.
Deeper than any human ever has...
...with a kind of understanding
that frightened me to my very soul.
Gosh, Betty. Almost sounds
like you like the Mutant.
Like a mutant?
Can anyone like a mutant?
- I wonder.
- The Mutant is strange.
We keep it merely as a pet to us.
I have never looked in its eyes.
- Have you?
- No.
Paul, what happened
to you? I went looking.
I don't know.
All I remember was...
...Pammy
- No.
She was really Animala.
Part woman...
...part four different forest animals.
And she can dance.
Oh, how she can dance.
Like I've never seen
a woman dance before.
Well, we've certainly had
quite a morning, haven't we?
We certainly have.
Do it. Do it.
Interesting, Paul. So you
would be a meteorologist?
No, Kro-bar, believe it or not...
...a meteorologist is actually
another name for a weatherman.
I study meteors, so I'm
actually a meteographer.
A lot of people don't know that.
Are you enjoying the
cranberroids, Betty?
You know, I am.
And I can't get over how similar
they are to something we have.
Only, we call them cranberries.
Cranberries.
Yes. It is interesting, the differences
and similarities we have, is it not?
Why, on our home planet, Marva...
...we have a custom of
actually eating outside...
...if weather is
pleasant and acceptable.
Why, we have that. We call it a picnic.
"Picnic." How delightful.
We call it cooty-lana.
<i>Cooty-lana. That's fun to say.</i>
Many things on Marva
are fun to say, Paul.
This space wine is
delicious. Heavenly bouquet.
Is it like our Earth wine?
Made out of grapes, Lattis?
Grapes? Oh, surely no, Betty.
Grapes on Marva are far too
sacred to step on, on Marva.
We make our wine from cherries,
which we call linbooba.
Cherry wine, what a delight.
And do your people love to get
intoxicated, as our people love to do?
No, Betty, we gave up getting
drunk eons of your years ago.
You know, this talking
that we're doing...
...is very helpful in getting
to know your people and mine.
Why, as we observed you from
afar, we thought of you...
...as little more than
pleasant, entertaining monkeys.
So dirty and foul.
You have taught us a lot...
...Paul and Betty Armstrong.
And you us.
There is one more thing
we would be taught now...
...and that's how to get
the atmosphereum back...
...so that my planet might benefit...
...and your ship might return you home.
You have a device, do you not?
A detector of atmosphereum?
The atmosphereum detector, of course.
And unless I miss my guess...
...Kro-bar, alien being
of the planet Marva...
...is about to suggest that
we use that very device...
...to track the meteor
that Rudolph Yaber stole.
Well, I didn't know...
...you were all mind
readers on the planet Earth.
Remember, we may come across the Mutant.
As I told you, it is
also rich in atmosphereum.
I know. I'm hoping the
radiation we find...
...is on something not
moving. Like a rock.
Yes, indeed.
- Lattis, I just have to ask you.
- Yes, Betty?
After meals on Marva, who cleans up?
- The men or the women?
- Cleans up?
Why, Betty, on Marva,
there is no cleaning up...
...because there's never a mess.
We gave up messes eons ago.
Think of it. A world without messes.
No ground-in dirt.
No ugly grease stains.
No burned pans or
hard-to-reach corners.
Lattis, Marva sounds like
such a wonderful place.
Excellent. You have
done well, my pigeons.
Already, I feel the life returning
to my tired and aching bones.
I can feel it. I'm sitting.
I'm sitting up.
Do you know how long
it's been since I sat up?
- Pigeons.
- I am yours to command...
...O Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
I have risen!
Something-
Something's coming.
- The Mutant! -
Fire. Fire, Kro-bar.
- Make it harmless.
- Something's wrong.
It's jammed. I think dirt got into it.
No, Paul! No! Paul!
No! No!
Paul! Paul!
I wonder why it changed its mind.
Oh, well. Paul! Paul, you
crazy, stupid, wonderful man...
- ...why did
you do it? - I-
I don't know, Betty.
I should stick to science...
...and leave battling alien
mutants to the experts.
I'm sorry about the
transmutatron, my Earth friend.
I'll take a look at it and see
if I can fix it in the shop...
...so that another of
us doesn't almost die.
You two better go back to
the cabin so Paul can rest.
I have a bottle of transmutatron
cleaner in the ship.
Come, Lattis.
Kro-bar...
...be careful.
I'm an alien, Paul, remember?
Look at it go.
What a skeleton.
Paul, please try and rest...
...that scientific
mind and body for once.
Rest? How can I rest...
...when the two best alien friends
a guy ever had may be in danger?
Paul, those two came over 1000 miles.
They can take care of a
little problem like a mutant.
Nothing's going to happen to Lattis.
She promised to show
me some space recipes.
Oh, that reminds me. My tapioca.
What orders do you have, my bony wonder?
Shut up.
Very well.
Follow me.
Climb down these rocks like I do.
Paul, you're not well enough.
You hardly touched your pudding.
If I'm wrong, I'll buy you
enough pudding to go to the moon.
I sense Lattis and Kro-bar
are in great danger.
Say hello to your new master...
...the Skeleton.
It may be dangerous. Don't tag along.
I'm tagging, Paul.
- I can't stop a woman from tagging.
- No one ever has.
Listen.
It isn't possible.
Dance. Dance!
You can't make aliens dance.
This is just wrong.
You don't know what
you're tampering with.
And you don't know the
Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.
But you will. You will.
Enough.
Yes, my skull.
Bring the female to me.
It's horrible. Horrible.
I can't watch this
- This dancing.
And I cannot not watch it.
May God have mercy on us all.
You! You shall become...
...the bride of the Lost Skeleton!
No!
Fiend!
What was that?
Let the dancing resume.
You swine!
So anyway.
After Kro-bar is dead, Lattis
will be free to marry...
...the king of cartilage himself.
Betty, I've got an-
I've got an idea.
It means finding the Mutant
with the transmutatron.
But it also means danger.
Real danger, kitten.
Are you game? I can't force you.
Well...
...if I wanted to have a safe life...
...l wouldn't have married
a man who studies rocks.
And you know, the way I figure...
...if it will stop my
new alien best friend...
...from being a widow and
married to a skeleton...
...well, just count
me in, Mr. Scientist.
That's my little meteorite.
Come on.
I guess we both have rocks in our heads.
I think he's sleeping.
How can you tell that, Roger?
I don't know.
Hey.
Hey, Skeleton?
Skeleton?
Stop it. Stop it, I say!
If he wakes, it'll be your fault.
But it'll be you he
yells at. It's always you.
He hates you, Roger.
All right, Animala, just
go see to the wedding plans.
Prepare the alien to
be the Skeleton's bride.
- How do I do that?
- Just do it!
Once this starts ticking,
we're in business.
- That's where I come in.
- It's your show then.
- Hopefully I'll get a curtain call.
- I hope you're around to enjoy it.
Let the Skeleton wedding begin.
Behold, the skeletal bride herself.
The alien himself
will present the bride.
- Such irony.
- No, you can't make me.
I won't present the bride.
I won't present the bride.
You will, and you'll like it.
I won't like it. I won't like it.
I won't like it.
Mind if I crash? Sorry if
I'm not on the guest list.
Seize her.
Hold her!
It's a day for wedding crashers.
I never got an invitation!
You two shall pay dearly
for ruining my special day...
...with your lives!
Master, my bony master,
what shall we do?
Skeleton? Lost Skeleton, no!
- Why me?
- I always hated you.
Stupid Skeleton. Stupid Skeleton!
You cannot strangle me.
How can you strangle that
which does not breathe?
I hate you. I hate you!
Bony idiot.
Foolish Mutant, you
have spoiled my plans.
Now you must pay.
No. No. I cannot lose.
I cannot. Obey me, Mutant.
- Obey the Lost Skeleton.
- He cannot, Skeleton.
Mutants are basically dumb brutes.
They don't have the mental capacity.
I will
- I will return.
No. No.
No!
It's strange, Paul...
...so very strange. I-
I don't think it ever meant to kill.
It just didn't know not to.
Look, Kro-bar's changing
Animala back into four animals.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, forest animals.
- Bye, animals.
- Bye.
Bye, animals.
A part of me is gonna miss Animala.
Not the part that's coming
home with me, I hope.
Kro-bar, will you come with
me and remove our meteor...
- ...from the Skeleton?
- Gladly, Paul.
You know, it's funny, but when
the kind of understanding...
...that you and I have over
a little piece of rock...
...spreads throughout the
universe, then and only then...
...will there be understanding
amongst all peoples, alien and alike...
...in all kinds of
places at the same time.
