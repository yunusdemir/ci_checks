Aren't you tired?
No.
There's so much of it.
Do you think
we'll live here
all the time, Pop?
Want to?
Sure. I like it.
Why did we always
live in California?
Oh, I was born there,
got married there,
just went right on
living there.
Did Mother ever
come with you
to New York?
No. I was here
by myself once
for three days.
You still think
of her, Tommy?
Sort of.
Not all the time.
Just sometimes.
How old was I
when she died,
Pop?
You were four years old.
A long time.
You ever going to
get married again?
Maybe. Want me to?
I don't care.
I like it fine this way.
But Grandma says
you're getting tougher
and tougher to have
around the house.
(CHUCKLING)
She does, does she?
Any more complaints
from Grandma?
She says you're
too picky and choosy.
Where are we going?
To meet Grandma at Saks.
Hey, Pop,
look at that.
What's he
supposed to be doing?
That's a statue
of Atlas, Tommy.
He's carrying the world
on his shoulders.
No kidding?
That's what Grandma
says you're doing.
And she wishes
you'd leave the world
alone a while.
Oh, yeah? Looks like
I'm gonna have
to slug Grandma.
Hey, we're late.
Grandma's going
to slug us.
Come on.
I just love
waiting for people.
I always say there's
nothing as much fun
as standing around
waiting for people
who are always late.
Well, we're late, Ma,
because I've been
carrying the world
around on my shoulders.
It's kind of heavy.
You can't walk too fast.
Put it down gently, dear,
and give me some money
for your son's shoes.
Now I'll thank you,
Tommy, to keep your
mouth shut hereafter.
I told Pop he was
getting tougher
and tougher
to have around
the house, too.
How much are shoes
in New York?
Better give her
10 bucks.
Wish me luck, Ma.
I'm going up to
the magazine now.
Good luck, Phil. I hope
it's something you want this
time, and not too far away.
It'll be right here.
Otherwise, Minify
wouldn't have
gone through
all the trouble to
get us the apartment.
Does Mr. Minify
always tell you
what to write?
Don't you ever
think up what to
write yourself?
Well, yeah,
I think sometimes
for myself.
Well, I'm late.
Have fun.
Boys' shoes?
Fourth floor. Yes?
WOMAN: Toy department,
please?
Second floor.
WOMAN: Thank you.
MAN 1: Right in there.
MAN 2: Thank you.
Smith's Weekly, please.
Reception room.
Sixth floor.
Right in there.
MAN 3: Going up.
MAN 4: Twelve, please.
Yes. I did have
an appointment.
I'm sorry. I have
no record of it.
I spoke with his secretary
day before yesterday,
and she said
to come in
this morning.
He'll be in himself
in a half hour.
If you don't
mind waiting,
I'll try again.
Yes, please?
I have an appointment
with Mr. Minify.
Name, please?
Schuyler Green.
Schuyler Green.
Telegram for
Mr. Pendleton.
Through the door,
second office
to the right.
Thank you.
Schuyler Green
to see Mr. Minify.
Thank you.
Mr. Minify is
expecting you.
Mr. Herman will
call for these.
Janet.
For Mr. Minify.
Follow me, please.
Thanks.
Yes, please?
Miss Dettrey's
expecting me.
RECEPTIONIST:
Just a moment, please.
Mr. Green.
Oh, Mr. Green.
Mr. Minify's on
the long distance.
He'll be through
in a moment.
Won't you
sit down?
Thanks.
Have you seen
the last issue?
No. Thank you.
MINIFY: Mr. Green
out there yet?
Yes. Mr. Green is here.
Good. I'll be right out.
Come in. Come in.
Glad you're here, Green.
This is
all right now, Miss Miller.
Get it off airmail special.
Glad to see you.
Come on in.
Thanks.
Sit down.
Finding your way around?
Almost.
Good.
Mother and kid
like New York?
Fine. They like the
apartment, too. Thanks.
Had a bit of luck.
Probably the last
apartment left in Manhattan.
Getting to know
people here?
Well, not yet.
I'm always a little
bit slow about that.
We'll fix that up right away.
How about tonight at my place?
Having some people,
couple of girls
and some people.
Thanks.
Some other time.
Nonsense. I won't
ask you another time.
Here's the address.
Miss Miller,
don't disturb me till
I call you, for anything.
Tell Mrs. Minify
Mr. Green's coming
to dinner.
Now, get good
and comfortable.
There.
Because I'm going
to talk to you
for about an hour.
Maybe two.
I've had an idea.
Do go into the bar,
won't you?
I'd love a martini.
Why don't we
get you one.
Fine.
MINIFY: Jessie.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Schuyler Green
I've been telling
you about. My wife.
Oh, don't be silly, John.
I know Mr. Green.
I've read everything
he ever wrote.
You just never
stop talking.
Get him a drink.
What'll you have?
A martini.
Good.
Kathy, this is
Mr. Green.
My niece, Miss Lacy,
and Bill Lacy.
How do you do?
How do you do?
You better clear
things up now, Jessie,
or it'll never get
straightened out.
Well, Mr. Green...
Kathy and Bill
have been divorced for
a couple of years, Green.
Calls herself Miss Lacy
and confuses everybody.
All very friendly,
very civilized,
and very dumb.
Likes your stuff, though.
Please sit down,
Mr. Green.
Bill, would you
get me another?
Sure.
Way it was before
all right?
Just right. Thank you.
I haven't read everything
you've written, Mr. Green,
but what I have
has been...
Thanks.
What do people call
a guy whose first
name is Schuyler?
Phil.
Good.
Then I don't have to say
"Green" all the time.
Too haughty, last names,
and Schuyler is impossible.
That bad?
I wouldn't call
a dog Schuyler.
John.
It was my mother's name.
My middle one.
I started signing
my stuff Schuyler Green
when I was on
the college paper
at Stanford.
It sounded better to me,
I guess, than Philip.
Like Somerset Maugham
instead of William,
Sinclair Lewis
instead of Harry.
Somerset, Sinclair,
Schuyler, all S's.
Maybe that means
something.
Yes.
Do you mind telling people
what you're writing now,
Mr. Green?
No, not at all.
Well, I'm not
writing anything
just now, but...
Let me tell her.
I've asked him
to do a series
on anti-Semitism.
Break it wide open.
Been wanting to do
it for some time.
Do I get
a credit line?
You?
Yes.
For what?
Well, don't you
remember back around
Christmas of last year,
that Jewish schoolteacher
resigning? I was the one...
Why, sure. I knew
somebody was after me,
but I forgot who.
John, the Jacksons
are here.
All right.
I'm always stealing ideas
without knowing it, Phil.
That's what keeps
the magazine original.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
Funny, your
suggesting
the series.
Is it? Why?
Oh...
Lots of reasons.
You make up your mind
too quickly about people,
Mr. Green.
Women, anyway.
I saw you do it
when you sat down.
(CHUCKLES)
As apparent
as all that?
You cross-filed
and indexed me...
A little too well bred,
self-confident,
artificial,
a trifle absurd,
typical New York.
No, I didn't have
time for all that.
Oh, yes, you did.
I even left out
a few things.
Faintly irritating
upper-class manner,
over-bright voice.
All right, all right,
I give up. You win.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't resist it,
because it's only
partly true.
Is this your
first trip east?
No, it's not
my first trip.
Every other time
I've been here, though,
I've had a plane or railroad
or boat ticket for tomorrow.
Are you going to stay?
I think so.
You're getting a pretty
complete story on me.
Now it's your turn.
Well, you know
I'm divorced.
I help run a nursery school.
I'm called Miss Lacy.
Do you want
just anything?
Just anything.
JESSIE: Dinner.
Dinner?
No reading comics
at the table, Tommy.
Put it away.
Let me finish.
I'm right at the end.
No making mysteries
at the table,
either, Phil.
Mysteries?
You haven't even
mentioned your assignment.
Oh?
He wants me
to do a series
on anti-Semitism.
You don't sound
very enthusiastic.
I'm not.
Will he insist
on your doing it?
Oh, no,
he's not that
kind of an editor.
Ma, what do you do
to just eggs to make
them taste this way?
Pray over them.
Have a good time
last night?
Yeah.
You know, you need
new people as much as
you need new places.
I mean,
everybody does,
not just you.
Thought it was
a good bunch
to start on.
Funny thing.
It was a girl,
Minify's niece,
who suggested that
series on anti-Semitism.
It was funny.
You don't say.
Why, women will be
thinking next, Phil.
What's anti-Semitism?
Hmm?
What's anti-Semitism?
Oh, that's where
some people
don't like other people
just because they're Jews.
Oh?
Why? Are they bad?
Some are, sure. Some aren't.
It's like everybody else.
What are Jews, anyway?
I mean, exactly.
Well, you remember
last week when you
asked me about
that big church?
Sure.
I told you there were
lots of different churches.
Yeah.
Well, the people
who go to that
particular church
are called
Catholics, see.
And there are people
who go to other churches,
and they're called
Protestants.
Then there are others
who go to still
different ones,
and they're
called Jews.
Only they call
their kind of churches
synagogues or temples.
And why don't some
people like those?
Well, that's kind of
a tough one to explain, Tom.
Some people hate Catholics
and some hate Jews.
And no one hates us,
'cause we're Americans.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Well, no, no.
That's...
That's another
thing again.
See, you can be
an American
and a Catholic,
or an American
and a Protestant,
or an American and a Jew.
But, look, Tom,
it's like this.
One thing's
your country, see?
Like America,
or France, or Germany,
or Russia, all the countries.
The flag is different,
the uniform is different,
and the language
is different.
And the airplanes
are marked different?
Differently,
that's right.
But the other thing
is religion,
like the Jewish,
or the Catholic,
or the Protestant religions.
See, that hasn't
anything to do
with the flag,
or the uniform,
or the airplanes.
You got it?
Yep.
Don't ever get
mixed up on that.
I got it.
Some people
are mixed up.
Why?
It's 8:30, Tommy.
You'd better get going.
You'll be late
for school.
Yeah, yeah, you'll be late.
Finish your milk.
Thanks, Grandma. Bye.
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)
That's all right, Phil.
You're always good with him.
That kid's going
to wreck me yet.
Did you and Dad have
to go through this
sort of stuff with me?
Of course we did.
Are you very
disappointed, Phil?
Yes, I am.
I was almost sure
he'd hand me
the Stassen story
or Washington.
I wasn't looking
for an easy one, Ma,
but I did want
something that I could
really make good on.
I'd so like
the first one here
to be a natural,
something I know
they'd read.
You mean there's
enough anti-Semitism
in real life
without people
reading about it?
No, but this one's
doomed before I start.
What could I possibly say
that hasn't been said before?
I don't know.
Maybe it hasn't been
said well enough.
If it had, you wouldn't
have had to explain
it to Tommy just now,
or your father
and I to you.
It would be nice
sometime not to
have to explain it
to someone
like Tommy.
Kids are so decent
to start with.
Home for lunch?
No.
Think I'll take a walk.
You're quite a girl, Ma.
You seem surprised.
Yes.
Why?
I didn't think you
were going to do it.
You have a bad
poker face, Phil.
I saw you were
disappointed in
the assignment
the minute I mentioned it.
That's why I didn't push it.
What changed
your mind?
A couple of things.
Uh-huh. I may put my
niece under contract,
inspiration department.
No, it wasn't that.
It was my kid.
I had to explain it
to him this morning.
It was kind of tough.
It's really each house,
each family that decides it.
Anyway, I want to
do it, very much.
I couldn't be
more pleased.
I'll need some
facts and figures
from your
research department.
What?
I said, I'll have
to get facts, figures
from your research people.
Now, wait a minute.
Hold on.
I've got 18 hacks
on this magazine
who can do this series
with their left hands
chock full of facts,
figures and research.
I don't need
you for that.
What do you think
I brought you here for?
Facts and figures?
Use your head.
Go right
to the source.
I want some angle,
some compelling lead,
some dramatic device
to humanize it
so that it gets read.
You don't want much.
You just want the moon.
With parsley.
Suggestion.
There's a bigger thing
to do than to go after
the crackpot story.
It's been done plenty.
It's the wider
spread of it that
I want to get at.
The people that would
never go near an
anti-Semitic meeting
or send a dime
to Gerald L. K. Smith.
All right.
I'll knock it around.
Give my best to the
research department.
So long.
You don't happen
to want my niece's
phone number, do you?
Regent 7-0-4-9-3.
We're having
dinner together.
I always like to go
right to the source.
Fresh coffee, sir?
Thank you.
You're a very
flattering listener.
Well, I've been
interested.
No, it's more
than that.
Your face takes sides
as if you were voting
for and against.
When I told you
about my longing
to have a nice home,
like other children,
you looked happy.
When I told you
about Uncle John
offering to
send me to Vassar,
you looked bleak.
How did your
parents take it
about Mr. Minify
giving you an allowance
and the pretty clothes
and all the rest?
Oh, they said
they wanted Jane,
my sister, and me
to have the things
that would make us happy.
And did they?
Yes, I think so.
I quit being envious
and snobbish.
I felt right and easy.
Now you're looking
all dubious again.
Please, don't think
that I'm just
sitting here
approving
and disapproving.
It's not that.
It's just that...
Well, I...
We've certainly
covered a lot of ground.
Are you engaged
to anybody now,
or in love or anything?
Not especially.
(CHUCKLES) Are you?
Not anything.
Dance?
Oh, by the way,
what was the point
of your ex-husband
being asked up
to the Minifys'
when you were there?
They trying to
bring you together?
Could be.
Aunt Jessie does it
every once in a while.
Did you ask me to dance?
(TYPEWRITER CLACKING)
MRS. GREEN:
Oh, Phil, Miss Lacy.
Okay.
He'll be right here.
(CHUCKLES)
He's still at it.
Hi. How's the big
outside world?
Still there?
Everybody having fun?
No, no, I'm fine.
Just wish I were dead,
that's all.
Oh, thanks, Kathy.
I'm in my stubborn
streak now.
If it won't budge,
I won't.
Well, that's great.
At the rate it's going now
do you think you'd like me
with white hair?
Yeah. I'd think you'd
look dandy with white hair.
I'll be right here,
still trying.
Oh, please do. If you
don't call, I just keep
wondering why you don't.
So it works out
as an interruption
either way.
Well, I'm a working
girl myself.
How many interruptions
a day do you want?
Oh, I'll thank you
to call me five
or six times a day.
It's your fault
I'm in this jam,
anyway.
Okay. Bye.
Why don't you take
some time off, Phil?
You've been at it
day and night now
for almost a week.
You know me, Ma.
When I'm like this,
I wouldn't be any fun
for Kathy or anybody else.
I'm certainly
no fun for myself.
No ideas at all yet?
Sure, plenty of ideas,
but they all explode
in my face after an hour.
So they just
don't stand up.
When you get the right one,
there's a kind of a click
happens inside of you.
It hasn't happened yet.
It doesn't look like
it's going to either.
I'm bored with
the whole thing,
bored with myself,
as a matter of fact.
Hey, Ma. Do you think
I'm losing my grip?
You know, writers do.
Maybe it's my turn.
(CHUCKLES) You better not.
You wouldn't be able to make
a nickel at anything else.
(CHUCKLES) Thanks.
You can go now.
That's a big help.
Bring those things
in with you, will you?
Isn't it always tough
at the start, Phil?
Never like this.
Never.
I've tried everything.
Anti-Semitism in business,
labor, professions.
It's all there, all right,
but I can't make it give.
I've tried everything,
separately and together.
Every time I think
I'm getting on the edge
of something good,
I go into it a little
deeper, and it turns
into the same old drool
of statistics
and protest.
It's like beating
your head against
a concrete wall.
Gee, I wish
Dave were here.
Dave Goldman?
Yeah.
He'd be the guy
to talk it over with,
wouldn't he?
Yes, I guess he would.
Still overseas?
Yeah. Looks like
he's stuck there, too.
He'd be just the one, though.
Hey, Ma, maybe
that's a new tack.
So far, I've been digging
into facts and evidence.
I've sort of
ignored feelings.
How must a fellow
like Dave feel
about this thing?
That's good, Phil.
Over and above
what we feel about it,
what must a Jew feel
about this thing?
Dave. Can I think
my way into
Dave's mind?
He's the kind of fellow
I'd be if I were a Jew,
isn't he?
We grew up together.
We lived in the same
kind of homes.
We were the gang.
We did everything
together.
Whatever Dave feels now,
indifference,
outrage, contempt,
would be the feelings
of Dave not only as a Jew
but the way I feel as a man,
as an American, as a citizen.
Is that right, Ma?
Sit down and write him
a letter now.
Hey, maybe I've broken
this logjam, Ma.
Maybe this is it.
Put it down to him
just like you
said it to me.
Now, what do I say?
What do I say?
"Dear Dave, give me
the lowdown on your guts
"when you hear about Rankin
calling people kikes.
"How do you feel
when you hear
about Jewish kids
"getting their
teeth kicked out
"by Jew-haters
in New York City?"
Could you write that
kind of a letter, Ma?
It's no good, all of it.
It wouldn't be any good
if I could write it.
There isn't any way
you can tear open
the secret heart
of another human being,
Ma. You know that.
Yes, I guess you're right,
but there must be some way.
There must!
Hey, don't you
get started.
I don't want to depress
the whole family.
You look tired, Ma.
Why don't you go to bed?
One good thing came
out of this, anyway.
Reminded me
I owe Dave a letter.
I'll write him anyway.
And I'd like a little more
sympathy around here
now that you see
how tough it is.
Sympathy?
(CHUCKLING) Oh, no.
But I think
it's worth it, Phil,
if that's any consolation.
It's mighty small,
Ma, mighty small,
but I'm in no
position to dicker.
Good night, baby.
(GROANING)
Tommy?
(MRS. GREEN GASPING)
Ma!
(GASPING)
Is it your heart?
Does it seem
like your heart?
Wait.
You all right?
Seem any easier?
Passing.
Well, I'll get a doctor.
I'll phone Kathy.
No.
She'll know
the right one.
Wait.
I never realized pain
could be so sharp.
You let me phone Kathy.
She'll know a heart man.
What time is it?
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
Come on.
Come back
and hold my hand.
Sure, sure.
(BUZZING)
Will she die, Pop?
Will she?
Well, she'll die
someday, Tom,
just like you
or me or anybody.
The doctor said
she might be fine
for years if she's careful.
Your grandma's
not young, Tom.
And all that
packing and unpacking
tired her out too much.
I'll bet we can run
this place between us.
Sure.
Say, Pop,
what are we going...
It's scary, Tom, I know.
I was scared
last night myself,
plenty.
But we'll take
good care of her.
She might be fine
until you're grown up
and married and have kids.
(DOORBELL BUZZING)
Well, that's the doctor.
Will you make
your own breakfast
and get off to school?
Sure.
We'll run this
place just fine.
You get going now.
I told your mother
the truth.
People with hearts
outlive everyone else
if they take care.
This may prove to be
what we call false angina
instead of the true angina.
You keep her in bed
for a few days,
and then we'll get her
to the office and really see.
No use getting
too technical until
we really know.
Doctor, are you sure?
I never minimize
at a time like this,
Mr. Green.
I don't frighten,
but I don't minimize.
Right now,
it's nothing
to worry about.
MRS. GREEN: Phil.
Go ahead.
I know the way out.
I'll keep dropping in
for the next few days.
Thank you.
Everything okay?
No need to look
like Hamlet.
I feel wonderful.
Well, don't crowd things.
You feel like talking?
Ever know me when I didn't,
except last night?
Now I really believe
the doctor for
the first time.
Good. So do I.
Tommy get off
all right?
Sure he did.
Fixed his own breakfast.
Did a good job of it, too.
I'll be up tomorrow.
No, you won't.
Yes, I will.
No, you won't.
Get any sleep?
Sure.
Eyes like poached eggs.
Get some sleep today, Phil.
Don't try to work, please.
Well, you don't need
to worry about that, Ma.
I've decided.
I'm going to
phone Minify.
You know, there's
a certain virtue
in knowing when
you're licked.
Well, I'm licked.
And I might as well
accept it gracefully.
I decided last night.
When?
When I was sitting here,
holding your hand,
waiting for the doctor.
Why?
Well, I was scared, Ma,
just like I used to be
when I'd get to
wondering what I'd do
if anything ever
happened to you.
It all came back.
I was a kid again,
and my ma was sick.
Now, Phil.
I wanted to ask,
is it awful?
Are you afraid?
But there are
some questions
nobody can ask
and they can't
be answered.
I'll know the answer
to those two only when
I feel it myself,
when I'm lying there.
And that's the way it is
with the series, Ma.
I can't really write it.
But you did get
the answers before, Phil.
Every article
you ever wrote, the right
answers got in somehow.
Yeah, but I didn't
ask for them.
When I wanted to find out
about a scared
guy in a jalopy,
I didn't stand out
on Route 66
and stop him
so I can ask
a lot of questions.
I bought myself
some old clothes
and a broken-down car
and took
Route 66 myself.
I lived in their camps,
ate what they ate.
I found the answers
in my own guts,
not somebody else's.
I didn't say,
"What does it feel
like to be an Okie?"
I was an Okie.
That's the
difference, Ma.
On the coal mine series,
I didn't sit in my bedroom
and do a lot of
research, did I?
I didn't go out and
tap some poor grimy
guy on the shoulder
and make him talk.
I got myself a job.
I went down in the dark.
I slept in a shack.
I didn't try to dig
into a coal miner's heart.
I was a miner.
Ma... Maybe.
Hey, maybe.
I got it!
The lead,
the idea, the angle.
This is the way.
It's the only way.
I'll... I'll be Jewish.
I'll... Well,
all I got to do
is say it.
Nobody knows me
around here.
I can just say it.
I can live it myself
for six weeks,
eight weeks, nine months.
No matter how long it takes.
Ma, it's right this time.
It must be, Phil.
It always is when
you're this sure.
Listen, I even
got the title.
"I Was Jewish
For Six Months."
It's right, Phil.
Ma, this is it.
That click just
happened inside of me.
Well, it won't be
the same, sure it won't,
but it ought to be close.
I can just tell them I am
and see what happens.
It'll work.
It'll work fine, Phil.
Dark hair, dark eyes.
Sure, so is Dave.
So have a lot of guys
who aren't Jewish.
No accent, no mannerisms.
Neither has Dave.
Name, Phil Green.
Skip the Schuyler.
Might be anything.
Phil Green.
Ma, it's a cinch.
Oh, Phil, this is
the best medicine
I could have had.
Look, will you keep
my secret if you
meet any new people?
It has to be
without exceptions
if it works at all.
If you're Jewish,
I am, too, I guess.
Hey, take it easy.
Don't get excited.
I got to phone right away.
Why don't you have
Kathy come over here?
How did you know
I wasn't going
to phone Minify?
Dope. Nobody phones
a magazine editor
with that look on his face.
Oh, Phil, it's nice.
It's attractive.
Well, it's not done yet.
Those packages are pictures.
The last of our
books just came.
You have a fireplace.
It works, too.
Mine's only fake.
How's your mother?
I spoke to Dr. Craigie
and he said she'd be fine.
Oh, she's all right.
What's the angle?
Tell me fast.
I will. Just a minute.
I want to check up on Ma.
Good. Give her my love.
She's sleeping
like a baby.
Good.
Don't worry
about her.
Let's have a drink.
No, thanks.
Just some sherry.
All right.
You're still not
telling me.
I know.
It's funny. I thought
I'd spill it out the minute
you got inside the door.
You sounded so excited.
I am.
It must have been
really something
to get you like this.
There will be
stumbling blocks and holes,
but I don't care.
I'll lick...
Lick them when
I get to them.
Kathy.
Phil.
Phil, wait, now.
You go over there
and let me sit
here for a minute.
What is it, Kathy?
Nothing.
I was just thinking.
Marriage can be
such a good way
to live, Kathy.
All these years,
I've kept hoping.
I've kept hoping, too.
But when you've
made a mistake once,
you're afraid.
You're not afraid now.
No, Phil.
Darling.
What are you
smiling at?
Nothing.
Come on,
no secrets.
I was just thinking.
I was just playing
that old game.
All women do it,
trying out the name.
Say it out loud.
Mrs. Schuyler Green.
Well, how does it sound?
It sounds just fine.
How does it look on me?
I like it.
Kathy, you're not
sorry about Tom?
Oh, Phil, I'm glad.
It's almost
as if my marriage
hadn't been wasted,
as if I'd had a son
growing up for me.
(INAUDIBLE)
I knew you'd get it,
but who'd ever think that...
But can you
get away with it?
Yeah, sure,
if you and Kathy
and Mrs. Minify
won't give me away.
I haven't told
Kathy yet.
I'll take care
of Mrs. Minify.
When do you start?
What's the matter
with right now?
Fine. I'll get you
an office and
a secretary right away.
But what about
the secretary.
She'd have to know,
wouldn't she?
Yeah. Well, why?
Supposing I were really
Jewish and you gave me
this assignment.
What difference
would it make
to her or anybody?
You're right, Phil.
I'm excited about this.
They'll read this
all right.
Mr. Minify.
Mr. Weisman
is waiting in
the dining room.
Yes. What about lunch?
Chance to meet
the whole staff
at one clip.
Irving Weisman
is lunching with us.
Might be wise
for you to know.
Yeah, he's the big
industrialist, isn't he?
Yes. Come on.
He's a colorful fellow.
Old friend of mine.
I know you'll
like him.
BILL: The picture of
the Empire State Building.
Look at this.
JOE: I know.
But it was over here. Yes.
BILL: Over to the left.
That's what I'm talking about.
Sorry we're late.
We're very sorry, Irving.
Mr. Phil Green,
Mr. Irving Weisman.
Mr. Weisman.
How do you do?
Lou Jordan,
our personnel manager.
Joe Tingler,
demon photographer.
Yeah, yeah!
Bill Payson,
art editor.
Bert McAnny,
the best layout man
this side of
the Mexican border.
And last is a kind
of dessert, Phil.
Anne Dettrey,
our fashion editor,
clever, beautiful,
and dangerous.
Eats men alive.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Sit down beside her.
I thought it was
Schuyler Green.
No, that's my
writing name.
Mr. Green is going to
do a series on
anti-Semitism for us.
Really? Again?
Not again.
For the first time.
We're going to
split it wide open.
Do you mind my saying,
as an old friend,
I think it a very
bad idea, John?
The worst,
the most harmful thing
you could possibly do now.
Not at all.
Why is it a
harmful idea?
Because it'll only
stir it up more.
That's why. Let it alone.
We'll handle it
in our own way.
The hush-hush way?
I don't care
what you call it.
Let it alone.
You can't write it
out of existence.
We've been
fighting it
for years.
We know from experience
the less talk there is
about it, the better.
Sure. Pretend it
doesn't exist
and add to
the conspiracy
of silence.
I should say not.
Keep silent
and let Bilbo
and Gerald L.K. Smith
do all the talking?
No, sir. Irving, you and
your let's-be-quiet-about-it
committees
have got just
exactly no place.
We're going to call
a spade a dirty spade.
And I think
it's high time
and a fine idea.
So do I.
I couldn't agree
with Mr. Minify more.
You sound pretty hot
about it, Mr. Green.
Well, I feel
pretty hot about it.
I don't think it
has anything to do
with the fact that
I'm Jewish myself.
Right office?
Mr. Green?
Yes, sir.
This is your office.
I'm your secretary,
Miss Wales.
Elaine Wales
is the name.
How do you do?
Mind if we get
right to work?
Not at all.
You know about
the series I'm doing?
Yes, sir.
Good.
The first thing I want
to start is a file.
I want you to
write form letters
to clubs, resorts,
interviews for jobs,
apartments for lease,
application for
medical schools,
and so forth.
I got a whole
list here somewhere.
Yes, sir.
Write the letters
on blank stationery.
And send two
to each address.
One of them I want it
to sign Schuyler Green,
and the other
Philip Greenberg.
See what I mean?
Yes, sir.
And have the replies
sent to my home address.
I'll give you
that later.
Yes, sir.
Of course, you know
that it will be yes
to the Greens
and no to the Greenbergs.
Sure, but I want it
for the record.
Now, if your name
was Saul Green
or Irving or
something like that,
you wouldn't have to
go to all this bother.
I changed mine. Did you?
Wales? No, Green's
always been my name.
What's yours?
Walovsky.
Estelle Walovsky.
And I just couldn't take it.
About applications, I mean.
So one day,
I wrote the same
firm two letters,
same as you're doing now.
I sent the Elaine Wales one
after they'd said
there were no openings
to my first one.
I got the job,
all right.
Do you know what
firm that was?
Smith's Weekly.
No.
(CHUCKLES)
Yes, Mr. Green.
The great liberal
magazine that fights
injustice on all sides.
It slays me.
I love it.
Mr. Minify
know about that?
Oh, he can't be bothered
thinking about small fry.
That's Mr. Jordan's
department,
hiring and firing.
But if anybody snitched,
you know there'd be
some excuse for
throwing them out.
So anyway,
I thought maybe you had
changed yours sometime.
I mean, when I heard
you were Jewish.
You heard it?
Why, sure.
Is this the list?
Yeah.
When?
Well, when you
finished luncheon
and went back
to Mr. Minify's office,
it kind of got around.
She'll be up and about
and fit as a fiddle
day after tomorrow.
You wouldn't mind
if I had her see
a good internist,
just to be
on the safe side?
Not at all. Good idea.
I'll make
an appointment
if you wish.
I always use
Mason Van Dyck
or James Kent.
Or if you have some
good man you'd like.
One of the editors
at the magazine
recommended someone.
Doctor... Dr. Abrahams.
Abrahams?
Yes, J. E. Abrahams,
Mount Sinai Hospital,
Beth Israel, or both.
Yes, yes, of course.
Well, if you
should decide to
have your mother
see Van Dyck or Kent,
I'll arrange it.
Why? Isn't this
Abrahams fellow
any good?
No, nothing like that.
Good man,
completely reliable.
Not given to overcharging
and stringing visits out,
the way some do.
Do you mean the way
some doctors do,
or do you mean
the way some
Jewish doctors do?
(CHUCKLES)
I suppose you're right.
I suppose some of us
do it, too, not just
the chosen people.
If Abrahams
doesn't impress me,
I'll try Van Dyck or Kent.
I've no special loyalty
to Jewish doctors
simply because
I'm Jewish myself.
No, of course not.
A good man's a good man.
I don't believe
in prejudice.
I see.
Well...
Good evening.
Evening, Mr. Green.
Evening, Mr. Olsen.
Say, Mr. Green,
why don't you fill out
one of them cards at
the post office better
or watch for
the mailman
and tell him?
Well, what's
the matter
with this way?
It's the rules.
Leave that alone.
It's nothing I can help,
Mr. Green. It's the rules.
The renting agent
should have explained.
That is,
excuse me,
if you are.
Excuse me, nothing.
This is my place
for two years,
and don't touch
that card.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
You don't mean that
we're going to have
dinner here?
I do, indeed.
So we can talk.
Talk?
You sit there.
I'm not going to
let you get going
on another thing.
You don't even
get dinner until you
tell me the angle.
I've been trying
to guess what it
is all day long.
Have you really?
Yes, I have.
I kept thinking,
"Suppose I were he,
"and I had to
find an angle?
What would I do?"
Well, what
would you do?
Well, I got
just no place.
Some of the ideas you told me
I thought were excellent,
but you threw them out
and kept hunting.
You'll see why just
as soon as I tell you.
Phil, tell me.
All right.
Here it is.
I'm just going to let
everybody know that
I'm Jewish, that's all.
Jewish?
But you're not,
Phil, are you?
Not that it would make
any difference to me,
but you said,
"I'm going to let
everybody know,"
as if you hadn't
before and would now.
So I just wondered.
Not that it
would matter to me
one way or the other.
Phil, you're annoyed.
No, I'm not.
I was just thinking.
Well, don't be
so serious about it.
You must know where I stand.
I do.
It's just that you
caught me off guard,
you know,
not knowing too
much about you,
because you always
make me talk about
myself all the time,
so that for a minute
there, I wasn't very
bright on the uptake.
Well, anyway, you don't
think much of my angle?
I do. It's...
It's what?
It's just that I...
I think it'll mix
everybody up.
People won't
know what you are.
Of course, after the series
is finished, they'll know,
but even so, it'll keep
cropping up. Won't it?
All right.
Let it.
I must be out of my head.
"Let it" is right. Who cares?
I was just being
too practical
about things.
That's what comes
from being a schoolteacher.
Now tell me more.
Well, to begin with,
you and the Minifys
will have to promise
not to give me away,
but, really,
no exceptions
for anything, okay?
Okay.
What about the
people at Smith's?
Won't they talk?
They're not in on it,
only Minify.
They think
you're Jewish?
Look, Kathy,
I don't think
you understand.
If this thing
is going to work,
the only chance is
to go whole hog at it.
It's got to go right
through everything.
Of course.
I hadn't really
seen it before.
I didn't mean
to be so sharp.
I'm sorry.
Dinner?
Fine.
You sit there.
I'm doing the
serving myself.
More coffee?
Only take a minute
to heat it.
No, thanks.
Well, I think
I'd better be
getting along.
So soon?
I should look in
at Ma before
she gets to sleep.
Of course.
You have to get
to the school pretty
early, don't you?
Yes.
I had a pretty
full day at the
magazine, too.
Yes.
It was a mighty
fine dinner.
I'm glad you liked it.
My car's downstairs.
Let me run you home.
No, thanks.
I think I'll walk.
It's a lovely night.
Yes, it is.
It's lovely.
I'd better be
getting off.
Don't bother.
I know where
my hat is.
It's no bother.
I'll call you
sometime tomorrow.
All right.
Good night.
Good night, Phil.
WOMAN: Mary said
to come right over
and that
it'll be perfectly
all right to bring you.
She's cooked
a big dinner,
so there's plenty...
I forgot something.
Darling!
I'm so glad you came back.
Kathy. What are we doing?
What am I doing to us?
It's my fault, dear.
I'm always weighing
and judging.
I'm such a solemn fool.
No, I should have
said the angle
was fine right away.
And it is, darling.
It is. It's wonderful.
I don't know
what happened.
It started
the minute you spoke.
I felt insulted.
If I were Jewish,
that's the way I would
have felt
and I couldn't
let you off.
I couldn't make it
any easier for you.
All through dinner,
I tried to reach you,
tell you I was sorry,
and I couldn't.
I don't know
what happened to me
when you told me,
except that a whole
beautiful evening
was spoiled.
I wanted you
to come back.
Darling.
But really, Mr. Minify,
I never make it a policy
just to hire...
It... Well, it's...
It's a question
of personality.
Please understand,
Mr. Minify.
If a girl's personality
is the type that fits in...
It's just by chance,
you mean,
that we haven't
one secretary named
Finkelstein or Cohen?
In the city of New York?
Come off it, Jordan.
Miss Miller,
take a help wanted ad.
"Expert secretary for
editorial department,
national magazine.
"Exacting work,
good pay.
"Religion is a matter
of indifference
to this office."
Got that?
Yes, Mr. Minify.
In any other ad you run,
be sure to use
that last line.
That's all, Miss Miller.
Good afternoon, Jordan.
By the way, if you should
have to fire Miss Wales,
for any reason
whatever at any time,
remember, I'd like
to review the case
myself first.
Good afternoon,
Mr. Minify.
I'm ashamed of myself
and this magazine, too.
The sloppy,
slovenly notion that
everybody's busy
doing bigger things.
Well, there just
isn't anything bigger
than beating down
the complacence of
essentially decent people
about prejudice.
Yes, I'm ashamed of myself.
Go on back to work.
PHIL: "I believe that
I've given a clear
"and accurate picture
of my qualifications,
"and I would
very much appreciate
"your immediate
consideration and reply.
Sincerely yours."
Better ask for
an immediate reply
on all of them.
Don't bother to do
it today, though.
It's too late.
Tomorrow will be
all right.
Mr. Green, have you any idea
when you'll start dictating
the series itself?
I would like to get
the decks cleared.
Well, I think I'll
type it out myself
to start with.
I'm not much good
on dictating actual copy.
Well, that'll be all,
Miss Wales.
You'd better
get along home.
All right.
Mr. Green, is it true
about Mr. Jordan?
What true about
Mr. Jordan?
Well, he's telling everybody
about Mr. Minify's ad.
He thinks it's
a wonderful thing,
he says.
He does, huh?
And I thought I'd ask you
if it's really true that
the ad says right out...
Right straight out,
Miss Wales.
And it's going to be
in all the papers tomorrow.
Practically inviting
any type at all to apply?
Any type?
What do you mean?
Mr. Green, you don't
want things changed
around here, do you?
Even though you are
a writer, and it's
different for writers.
Different for
writers? How?
Well, I mean,
just let them get one
wrong one in here,
and it'll come out of us.
It's no fun
being the fall guy
for the kikey ones.
Now, look, Miss Wales,
we've got to be
frank with each other.
You have a right
to know right now
that words like yid,
and kike, and kikey,
and nigger, and coon
make me kind of sick
no matter who says them.
But I only said it
for a type.
Yeah, but we're
talking about
a word first.
But, Mr. Green,
that doesn't
mean a thing.
Why, sometimes
I even say it to myself,
about me, I mean.
Like if I'm about
to do something and
I know I shouldn't,
I say, (LAUGHING)
"Don't be such a little kike."
That's all.
But let one objectionable
one get in here...
Well, just a minute.
What do you mean
by objectionable?
Loud and too much rouge...
They don't hire any loud,
vulgar girls here.
What makes you think
they're going to
suddenly start?
It's not only that.
Mr. Green, you're
sort of heckling me.
You know as well
as I do, the sort
that starts trouble
in a place like this
and the sort that doesn't,
like you or me,
so what's the sense
of pinning me down?
You mean, because
we don't look
especially Jewish,
because we're okay Jews,
because with us,
it can be kept nice and
comfortable and quiet?
I didn't say...
Now, listen,
Miss Wales,
I hate anti-Semitism,
and I hate it when
it comes from you
or anybody who's Jewish,
just as much
as I hate it when it
comes from a Gentile.
Me? Why, Mr. Green...
See you tomorrow,
Miss Wales.
Good night.
Why don't you
go home?
I'm slowly
going crazy.
ANNE: Hi, there!
Hello, Miss Dettrey.
How can you stride
down the hall with
such energy and vitality
at the end of the day?
I'm bushed.
Getting the book to bed
gets worse every issue.
I didn't know
you called it
"the book" around here.
Oh, we do. We do.
We're sophisticated
New Yorkers, Mr. Green.
By the way,
do you happen
to be thirsty?
I do,
and I'm just
in the mood
to hear the story
of your life.
Why, Mr. Green, I think
this can be arranged,
if you play your cards right.
You know a nice
bar we can go to?
This couldn't
happen to a nicer girl.
And he liked it.
And that's how
I got to be
fashion editor
in the first place.
Hello, Jim.
How are you?
Oh, fine.
Don't look now.
But I think we've
got visitors.
Just when I was getting
to the really tender
part of my life, too.
Mind if I sit with
you charming people?
No. Sit down, Bert.
Sit down.
Only got a minute.
May I?
Certainly.
You two seem to be
having such fun
over here,
I couldn't resist it.
We just love to
spread merriment.
Our hearts are
God's little garden,
just an occasional
weed, here and there.
Well, Anne,
another issue
gone to press.
I swear I don't see
how we do it every week.
Well, we're just
brilliant, Bert.
Every morning,
I get up and
I say to the mirror,
"Mirror, mirror,
on the wall, tell me
"who's the most
brilliant of them all?"
What does
the mirror say?
That mirror ain't no
gentleman, Mr. Green.
Well, Green,
how's the series coming?
Well, I'm still just
getting stuff together.
There's plenty of it around.
You know, when I was
stationed at Guam,
our C.O.
Used to talk
to us about it.
Quite a liberal,
that fellow.
You were in
public relations,
weren't you?
What makes you say that?
I don't know.
You just seem like
a clever sort of a guy.
What makes you
think I wasn't a GI?
Huh?
Now, for goodness' sake,
Green, don't get me wrong.
Why, some of
my best friends...
I know, dear.
And some of your
other best friends
are Methodist,
but you never
bother to say it.
Now, look, Anne.
Skip it.
Flag the waiter,
Phil, and be a dear?
Well, if you'll
excuse me,
I've got to run.
I'll be seeing you.
(SIGHS)
Little drip.
(MOCKING) "Now,
for goodness' sake, Green,
don't get me wrong."
Really believes
it, too.
Disapproves
of the poll tax
and Bilbo.
Comes right out
and says so,
brave as anything.
He's just a drip,
let's face it.
That imitation
was wonderful.
Got a million of them.
Well, we're back
to laughs, anyway.
Say, I'm having
a flock of people up
tomorrow night.
What about pressing
your black tie
and coming up?
Sure. Like it fine.
Can I bring my girl?
Of course.
What'll you
have, sir?
More of the same.
Thank you, sir.
Wait here, will you?
I'll be right back.
Surprise.
Well, that's what
I call timing.
I saw your cab drive up.
I just couldn't wait.
(WHISTLES)
Oh, brother.
Oh, it's nothing.
Little lady
comes in twice a week
and whips them up for me.
Been with the family
for generations.
Look at you.
First time I've seen
you in dinner clothes.
Good enough to
eat with a spoon.
Come on, dear,
let's go.
Oh, I told Ma today
all about us.
Phil, was she pleased?
Was she?
She was delighted.
She got very emotional.
For Ma, anyway.
She dropped one
of her best dishes
and broke it,
and blamed it all
on Tommy.
I called my sister
Jane this morning,
I sort of blurted it
out in the telephone,
and she squealed,
"Kathy!"
As if she'd given up
all hope that anyone
would ever ask me again.
Darling, she's
aching to meet you.
In fact, they're giving
a big party for us
next Saturday.
Won't we have to
let Jane in on it?
I don't know.
I hadn't thought.
I hadn't, either,
until now, but won't we?
My own sister.
Your mother knows.
Well, I know,
dear, she had to,
but Jane and
her husband don't.
You know, if you want
to keep a secret...
But wouldn't it be
sort of exaggerated
with my own sister?
Your sister-in-law,
almost.
Darling, I do think
it would be
inflexible of you.
Well, I suppose it would,
inside the family.
They won't tell
anybody else,
will they?
Oh, they'd
never breathe it.
They want to
fight this awful thing
as much as you and I do.
Darling, I'm going
to be the proudest
girl on the block.
I don't have to
kiss you in public.
I've got a nice
dark taxi outside.
Well, what are
we waiting for?
Come on.
Don't just stand there.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
She's awfully
attractive, isn't she?
Yeah. She looks
really beautiful.
She certainly does,
and she likes you a lot.
I'll scratch her eyes out
if she makes a play for you.
That's no way to talk.
Relax. You haven't got
a thing to worry about.
Hello, Anne.
Hello, Anne.
Can I get you something?
Food, drinks,
some certified checks,
spending money, an emerald?
It's a lovely
party, Anne.
It will be better
when it thins out a bit.
I think I can
get Sasha to play
and Ethel to sing.
Good.
Stick around.
Say, Phil,
Professor Lieberman
just came in.
Would you
and Kathy like
to meet him?
Lieberman,
I should say so.
Hey, I'm scared.
What does one say
to a world-renowned
physicist?
Just "Hello, toots."
Come on.
He's a wonderful guy.
Watch your elbow.
I'm not happy till
I'm out in my boat.
I love that.
I bought myself
a new one.
You ought to join me one day.
You look tired and drawn.
Say when.
It'll do you good.
Well, let's say...
Professor,
two people
want to meet you,
but are scared.
They'll introduce
themselves.
That'll make them
open their mouths,
anyway.
Anne.
You're on
your own, kids.
Fine friend.
Come on, Fred.
I want them to be alone.
Professor, this is
my fiancée Kathy Lacy.
How do you do,
Professor?
I'm Phil Green.
As a matter of fact,
John Minify
has been wanting
to get us together.
Oh, yes, yes.
Yes, he told me he did.
How do you do?
I'm doing a series
for him on anti-Semitism.
For or against?
Well, he thought
that we might hash
over some ideas.
What sort of ideas?
Palestine,
for instance. Zionism.
Which? Palestine as a refuge,
or Zionism as a movement
for a Jewish state?
The confusion
between the two,
more than anything.
Good. If we agree
there's confusion,
we can talk.
We scientists
love confusion,
but right now,
I'm starting on a new
crusade of my own.
You see, my young friends,
I have no religion,
so I'm not Jewish by religion.
Further, I'm a scientist,
so I must rely on science,
which shows me
I'm not Jewish by race,
since there's
no such thing as
a distinct Jewish race.
There's not even
such a thing as
a Jewish type.
Well, my crusade
will have a certain charm.
I will simply go forth
and state flatly,
"I'm not a Jew."
With my face,
that becomes
not an evasion,
but a new principle,
a scientific principle.
For a scientific age.
Precisely.
There must be millions
of people nowadays
who are religious only
in the vaguest sense.
I've often wondered
why the Jewish ones
among them
still go on calling
themselves Jews.
Can you guess
why, Mr. Green?
No, but I'd
like to know.
Because the world
still makes it an
advantage not to be one.
Thus, for many of us,
it becomes a matter of pride
to go on calling
ourselves Jews.
So you see,
I will have to abandon my
crusade before it begins.
Only if there
were no anti-Semites,
could I go on with it.
And now I would like
to try another little
scientific experiment.
I wonder if you
would leave me alone
with your very
beautiful fiancée
while you went
and got me
a plate of food?
Well...
Both in the interest
of science.
Anything for science,
Professor.
I'm John Minify's
niece Kathy Lacy.
And a little onion.
There. Now go
play with that, Fred.
Thank you.
This is not my third trip
around, Miss Dettrey.
It's for
Professor Lieberman.
Who's counting?
Shall I fix him
some caviar?
Caviar.
It's all deductible
from my income tax, dear.
I have to give parties
to see what the women
are wearing. Get it?
You old crook.
Young crook, please.
Okay.
How do you like
my girl, Anne?
She's lovely.
Is it serious or
just the first-find
careless rapture?
Serious, all right.
We're going to be
married any minute.
My congratulations,
you willful,
headstrong fellow, you.
When did
all this happen?
First time we looked
at each other, I guess,
third day I came to New York.
Tall buildings and subways
and traffic didn't
scare you at all?
Not a bit.
I brushed the hay and
straw out of my hair
and fell right in love
with a city girl.
You could crawl right into
The Saturday Evening Post,
couldn't you?
Have you met her family yet,
her sister and the rest?
No, not yet.
Do you know them?
Slightly. You going
to meet them soon?
Next week,
I think. Why?
I'd just like
the newsreel rights.
That's all.
Well, what do you mean?
What's the matter with them?
Nothing. I just think
it's a fine idea to meet the
family first, don't you?
It saves wear
and tear afterwards.
Nice party.
It's even nicer here.
I've been thinking,
maybe it would be better
if you didn't tell your
sister after all, huh?
Not tell her? Why?
Well, the whole business
depends on my not
making loopholes
whenever it's convenient.
I've already told her.
You did? When?
Mmm-hmm.
Tonight.
I called her
from Anne's.
Jane made me promise
to let her know
the minute
you said you'd be
free for Saturday.
You know, it takes
time to make arrangements
for a big party.
What'd she say
when you told her?
Oh, she thought
it was the cleverest way
in the world to do research.
You'll love her.
And Harry, too.
They're grand people.
But she promised?
I wouldn't tell her
until she had. And Harry.
She just asked that
you skip the whole
thing for the party.
She didn't mean to deny it,
just not to bring it up.
And I said...
You said no.
What?
You said,
"No, he won't skip the
whole thing for the party."
No, I didn't.
I said I'd ask you.
I'd never say yes
without asking you.
You mean,
you think I should?
(CHUCKLES) Darling,
why do you always lose
your sense of proportion
whenever the subject
comes up?
That was what
was so wonderful
about Professor
Lieberman tonight.
He certainly feels
the problem as deeply
as anyone else,
yet he did have
a sense of humor
about it.
And besides,
you know those
suburban groups,
Connecticut,
Darien, up there.
It would just
start a whole mess
for Jane and Harry
for nothing.
And if it were
a mess for something?
But, Phil,
you're not Jewish.
It would just ruin
the party for Jane
if she had problems with it.
Why can't
I make you see that?
I know I promised.
No exceptions.
And you were
being reasonable to
stretch it to Jane.
But it just seems so silly
to start a thing for her
up there when it's not true.
Why not tell Jane
just to call off
the party?
Well, it would
seem so queer.
Her only sister
getting married,
and if you were,
I'd manage.
Thanks.
Now, Phil, I'm not asking
you to make loopholes
where it counts,
at the office,
meeting people,
like at Anne's tonight,
but to go
up to Connecticut
to a party...
And if we were
to use my house
next summer...
And besides,
Jane and Harry...
I thought you said
they were so grand.
They are,
but they
can't help it
if some of their
friends are...
And besides,
it would just make...
A thing, a mess,
an inconvenience.
Well, it would.
For Jane and Harry,
or for you, too?
I'd be so tensed
up all the time,
I wouldn't have
any fun either.
Oh, Phil, if everything's
going to be so tensed up
and solemn, I...
I think
I'd better go now.
MRS. GREEN: Wake him up
no matter what he says.
Tell him to hurry.
Don't worry.
I'll get him.
Pop.
Pop, get up.
It's for you.
Grandma said
to wake you.
Uh-huh.
Hello.
It's for you.
What for?
Telephone.
Okay.
Get up!
It's late, isn't it?
Mmm-hmm.
Here's your bathrobe.
I don't want it.
I said put it on.
Hey, Pop,
here are your
slippers.
Finally roused him.
Hello.
Dave...
Dave! Where are you?
When did you get in?
It's Dave!
Hey, this is wonderful.
Where are you?
(LAUGHING)
La Guardia. Just now.
I had a break
and got assigned
to a plane with my C.O.
And I haven't had
breakfast. Get it?
Well, grab yourself
a cab and get right
over here, will you?
Okay. So long. Hey, Ma.
Can you summon up
some of your
famous hotcakes?
We used to eat
a stack apiece
in the old days.
I guess the old
magic still works.
Can I have some,
too, Grandma?
How many breakfasts
can you eat in one day?
Okay. I never
have any fun.
You're going to
be late for school
if you don't hurry.
I know what time
school starts.
And besides,
I don't like fruit.
You like bananas,
don't you?
Well, bananas
are different.
Say, Pop!
Huh?
Are we Jewish?
Jimmy Kelly said we were.
Our janitor told his janitor.
Well, what did you
say to Jimmy Kelly?
I told him
I'd ask you.
You remember
that movie that Kathy
and I took you to?
Sure.
And how you asked
if things like that
really happened?
Kathy said they
were pretending.
Yeah, well,
I'm pretending
that I'm Jewish
for the stuff that
I'm writing now.
Oh, you mean like
a movie or a game?
Yeah, something
like that.
Look, Tom, I'd like it
if you'd promise not to
tell anybody it's a game.
Would you
promise that?
Okay. Sure.
All right.
What'll you tell
Jimmy, Tom?
Well, I'll say
I haven't any
information.
Well, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Maybe that's not
such a good idea
to say you
haven't any
information.
Maybe you better say
that you'd asked me,
and I said I was
partly Jewish, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
But not tell him
it's the movie part?
Have some more, Dave?
Doctor, Doctor, please,
you're hitting a nerve.
Good. Then I can
go do my marketing.
And I'll thank
you two hulks
to at least pile
the dishes in the sink
while I'm gone.
Dave, it's wonderful.
Do you really think
you'll bring Carol
and the kids east
and live in New York?
We can all be
together.
That's the plan.
You know, I can be
eastern representative
of the firm. Big job.
Best break I ever had.
It all depends,
of course, if I can
find a place to live.
I'm going to spend
my terminal leave
just to look
and look and look,
and try to find
a place big enough
for Carol and the kids.
We'll find you something
if we have to dynamite.
Meantime,
you'll stay here.
Sure, Tommy can
sleep on the sofa
in the living room.
Now, wait a minute...
No arguments, please.
You're talking
to a civilian, Captain.
You win.
You know, my C.O.
Had to move in
with an uncle
he hasn't seen since
the First World War.
I'll help
with the cooking.
Not while I'm conscious,
you won't. Goodbye, boys.
Don't settle
all the problems today.
Save some for tomorrow.
Boy, I'm loaded.
You know, I used
to dream about
doing this, Phil.
What about this
series you're doing?
I've talked
about myself enough.
Come on. Give.
We'll get to it later.
What's eating you,
Phil?
Who, me?
You expecting a call?
You keep looking out
toward the phone
every few minutes.
It's that obvious?
I... I had a scrap
with my girl.
I guess I wanted her
to be the one to phone.
That's another
department.
I'm doing a series
on anti-Semitism
with a special angle.
That's interesting.
Interesting?
Don't you want a good,
stiff series
in a big national
magazine?
Me? Sure.
You sound bored.
I'm anything but.
It's just that...
Well, I'm on the sidelines
of anti-Semitism.
It's your fight,
brother.
Okay, I get it.
Listen, I don't care
about the Jews as Jews.
It's the whole thing,
not the poor, poor Jews.
Well, you know
what I mean.
Don't force me to make
with the big words.
Anyway,
what's this special
angle you've got?
Well, I've been
doing it for a while.
I'm saying I'm Jewish,
and it works.
Why, you fool.
You crazy fool.
And it's working?
It works.
It works too well.
I've been having
my nose rubbed in it
and I don't like the smell.
Yeah. I can guess.
You're not
insulated yet, Phil.
It's new every time,
so the impact
must be quite
a business on you.
You mean you get
indifferent to it
in time?
No, but you're
concentrating a lifetime
thing into a few weeks.
You're making
the thing happen every day.
Going out to meet it.
The facts are
no different, Phil.
It just telescopes it,
makes it hurt more.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
No. Sorry.
Wrong number.
You want to
talk about it?
No. It's just one
of those things.
I'm probably wiser
staying on my own.
After seven years
alone, you lose the
instinct for marriage.
Baloney.
You and Carol
ever get off on
tangents much?
Who doesn't?
Go on and call her,
you big dope.
So, you're right,
and she's wrong.
So what?
So she has to
telephone you first?
Who makes such rules,
the Supreme Court?
Go on and call her
and stop licking
your wounds.
Listen.
Meet me at the office
between 5:30 and 6:00.
I'll phone her.
I'll get Anne Dettrey.
She's a girl who
works at the office.
We'll have
a big celebration.
Okay.
Hey, can you imagine
what it's gonna be
like me married again,
you and Carol here,
all of us together?
How about that, huh?
First, I've got
to imagine a roof
over Carol's head.
Go on. Get going.
I'm going to start
looking right away.
How long do we
have to wait?
I'll take you
to your table as soon
as it's ready, sir.
How about these
other people?
They're getting in
without waiting.
They had
reservations, sir.
Who do you have to know
to get a reservation?
Me, madam.
Oh, Captain,
I'm expecting a call.
I left word that I'm here.
Will you call me
when it comes?
Down at the end.
Your name, sir?
Phil Green.
Yes, sir.
Thanks.
DAVE: Have you ever
been to Paris?
ANNE: Yes, I have.
DAVE: Well, there's
a lovely restaurant
on the Boulevard
Montparnasse...
Yes.
...and we had
delicious pressed duck.
Anyone we know?
Know what I'm having,
gentlemen?
What?
More fun than you
can shake a stick at.
You want me to send
the waiter out to get
a stick just for a test?
No, thanks.
None of those
things work for me.
Once I tried to let
a smile be my umbrella.
I got awful wet.
Another time,
I kept a stiff upper lip
for about a week.
People just thought
I was having
my face lifted.
Tell me something,
gentlemen,
tell me why it is that
every man who seems
attractive these days
is either married
or barred on
a technicality?
Your timing is rotten,
but your instincts
are just great.
Here's to my instinct.
Pardon me.
Oh, pardon me.
You know,
I don't like officers.
Well, neither do I.
I don't blame you.
What's your name, bud?
Dave. Dave Goldman.
What's yours?
Never mind
what my name is.
I told you
I don't like officers.
I especially
don't like them
if they're yids.
Sorry, sir.
He's terrible when he gets
all tanked up. Sorry.
What's the matter
with you, anyway?
Come on, leave him alone.
Let's take a walk.
Come on. Sit down.
Take it easy, boy.
I'm terribly sorry
this happened, sir.
He won't bother you again.
I was just coming
over to tell you
there's a call for you.
Telephone, Mr. Green.
A lady.
Oh, thanks.
Come on,
let's eat, Anne.
You have a caller
for Mr. Green? Yeah.
Hello, Kathy?
Where are you?
I'm up at Jane's.
I came up
to have it
out with her.
I couldn't call you
until I'd fixed
everything up.
Darling,
I was wonderful.
I said all the things
you would have
wanted me to say.
You would have
been proud of me.
Why can I
make myself clear
to Jane and Harry
when it's you
I want to be
clear with?
Well, I told you,
baby, sometimes I can
be such a solemn fool.
I'm hard to
get along with.
The party's tomorrow.
Will you take the 3:00 train?
And I'll be waiting
for you at the station.
Darling, I can
breathe again now that
I've talked with you.
I can scarcely
wait until tomorrow.
Good night, baby.
Oh, Kathy,
I love you, darling.
And I love you
more than ever.
Goodbye.
Welcome to Darien.
How are you?
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Oh, hurry, Harris.
Come on, they're parched.
Your mother must
be so proud of you,
Mr. Green.
Well, yes,
I hope so.
You enjoying
yourself, Phil?
Having a fine time.
Jane...
Does your mother just adore
everything you write?
Well, not everything.
No, not exactly.
Oh, she must.
Some people have
all the luck.
Yes, he's kind of nice.
Nice?
If I thought there were
any more around like that,
I'd go up into
the hills myself
and catch him
with my bare hands.
Oh, you would?
Yes, I would.
My dear, he's divine.
How long was he around loose?
About three days.
Mind if I steal
Kathy away?
Jane, you look
beautiful.
So do you.
It's a wonderful party,
isn't it, dear?
It's going
beautifully, my dear.
I haven't seen the Bascoms.
Oh, didn't I tell you,
Joe called and said
he had that
dreadful arthritis
he's always getting,
and they said
they were so sorry.
And where are the Howards
and the Berlicks?
Or are they coming
later for dinner?
Um, no. They all decided
to go to Hot Springs
at the last moment.
I thought
I mentioned it.
Jane, dear, I'm in this
just as deeply as Phil.
I feel just as
strongly about it
as he does.
But, darling,
what do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Just a little
careful screening?
Just the safe ones?
Oh, darling,
you're mad.
You're getting
a little hipped
on this series, too.
Mr. Green, tell me,
do you get your ideas
first and then write
or do you write first
and then get your ideas?
Well, I... I'm afraid
I don't think I quite
understand what you mean.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Darling, I'm afraid
I'm going to have
to spirit you
away for a minute.
Oh?
Would you excuse us?
Why, certainly, my dear.
You make such
a charming couple.
And we all wish
you great happiness.
Thank you. Thank you.
We'll be right back.
Oh, no, no, no!
Kathy?
KATHY: Jane?
Kathy, wait a minute.
Where are you going?
Phil and I are
going to disappear
for a minute.
I want to show him
the house before
it gets dark.
And we both
need a breather.
Of course. Give us all
a chance to talk about
Phil without whispering.
But he's won everybody.
Has it been awful, Phil?
No, I'm coming
back for more.
Good boy. Harry says
this sort of thing
is a kind of
mental bankruptcy,
but we women love it,
don't we, Kathy?
We certainly do.
Come on, darling.
See you later.
Goodbye.
I feel pretty much
of a fool over the fuss
I kicked up beforehand.
Can't imagine why
Jane even bothered
to ask if I'd lay
off for the party.
They all asked
about the series,
thought it was fine.
Not one lifted
eyebrow in the bunch.
Hey, Miss Lacy,
you're not even listening.
That's right.
I was thinking about you,
how wonderful you are.
Darling, there it is.
Aren't you supposed
to carry me across the
threshold or something?
(CHUCKLING) That's only
if you refuse to marry me,
in which case I take
you and throw you in.
Well, it's lovely.
It has a kind of
quiet all its own.
Did you do it
all yourself?
Every bit of it.
We can redo the nursery.
That was when
Bill and I hoped
we'd have a child.
Could be Tom's room.
Will he like
the country, Phil?
He'll be crazy about it.
You and Bill
live here long?
Bill and I have
never lived here.
Never? Why not?
Well, it's hard
to explain.
I love this
house deeply,
and I started
to build it
when things first
began to go wrong
between Bill and me.
And somehow it became
a symbol to me
of many things.
Sometimes when
you're troubled
and hurt,
you pour yourself
into things that
can't hurt back.
Can you
understand that?
Sure.
I've done it
myself with work.
Well, I poured all my
hopes into this place,
and when it was finished,
I somehow knew
that Bill and I
were finished.
I knew I couldn't
live here with someone
I didn't really love.
It was always more than
just a house to me,
a place I owned.
It meant everything
I hoped for,
marriage, children,
good life.
I knew I couldn't
live here alone.
I knew that for sure.
And you've never
lived here at all?
No, never.
No one has.
I stay up at Jane's,
and I come down here
and walk through the house,
poke at the curtains
a bit, sit out here.
And for a long while,
I hated it,
really hated it.
But I could
never let it go,
and now I know why.
I was right
not to settle
for second best.
I was right to keep hoping,
because it's all come true.
Darling, you and I
are going to be
so happy here.
This house and I,
we were waiting for you.
I was always
waiting for you,
I think.
KATHY: Coffee,
coffee, coffee.
Anne, will you
bring the cream
and the mints?
ANNE: Mints? Where?
Right there.
How do you want
your coffee, Dave?
Black?
Fine.
Why don't you play that piece
that you know, dear, and make
it a perfect evening?
You know,
she plays beautifully.
Darling,
you keep on thinking
I play beautifully.
Well, you do.
Anne, would you
put the radio on?
Sure. Okay.
You know something, Anne,
these two act like
an old married couple,
and two days
before the wedding.
It's kind of indecent.
And depressing.
At least give a little
nervous flutter
once in a while, Kathy,
or the bellboys
won't make jokes
to each other
as they carry up
your bags.
Well, is the honeymoon
place a secret?
Mmm. Big dark secret.
We're going to the White...
(EXCLAIMS) Don't tell
him where. He's nosy.
Liable to turn up at
odd hours pretending
he's the house detective.
Oh, I'd love that.
I've always wanted to
tell a house detective
what for, haven't you?
We're going to Flume Inn.
Do you know it?
What? Flume Inn
on your honeymoon?
Oh, no, you wouldn't.
You're kidding.
No, we're not.
Well,
what's the matter
with Flume Inn?
Well,
it's restricted,
that's all.
Restricted?
Darling, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize
when I sent the wire.
Oh, that's all right, baby.
It's not your fault.
So that's how it is.
Restricted.
Are you sure, Anne?
Have you been
there recently?
No, and I'm sure.
But they confirmed
the reservation.
I'm not going to let
them off the hook.
Darling, we can
open the cottage.
We won't have to tell Jane...
Oh, sure, sure.
You can always
go somewhere.
(PHONE RINGING)
Those nasty little snobs
aren't worth fretting over.
There must be something
to do besides accepting this.
You can't pin
them down, Phil.
They never say
it straight out
or put it in writing.
They'll worm out of
it one way or another.
They usually do.
Phil. It's Tom.
He wants you.
He sounds frightened.
Hello, Tom. What's up?
What?
Tom, listen, there's
a bottle of medicine
in the cabinet.
Get it and give some
to Grandma right away.
Yeah, I'll be there
in five minutes.
What's happened?
Sounds like a stroke.
DAVE: Well, I'll get a cab.
Anne, find
Dr. Abrahams' name
in this directory,
and ask him to get
down there right away.
J. E. Abrahams.
I'm going with you.
(CLICKING TONGUE)
Hmm?
Oh!
She is magnificent.
Never complains.
Just keeps worrying
about my school if
I'm down here all day.
Maybe we ought to hire
a part-time maid, Kathy...
Ever try drying
dishes and keeping
your mouth shut?
It goes much faster.
Cheer up, darling.
Postponing a wedding
isn't the worst
thing in the world.
Well, I suppose
it isn't.
Just a week,
two at the most,
Abrahams said.
Well, might as well
break the news, folks.
I'm afraid
I won't be
here for it.
What? Why, Dave,
you got to be.
I don't think Phil
could get married
without you,
and I couldn't either.
Why? What happened?
Nothing.
That's just it.
I can't abandon
my family forever
or find a house
or an apartment.
If it was just me alone,
I'd sleep in the subway,
but I've got Carol and
the kids to think about.
I've got to go back.
There's no two ways
about it. I'm licked.
Yeah, but that
means the job,
your whole future.
I'll live.
I did before.
Why, Dave,
that's terrible.
I spoke to Carol
on the phone
last night.
I told her
I'd give it
one more day,
but I know there
isn't a chance.
She's lonely, too.
I've got to go back,
big job or not.
What is it, Phil?
Oh, nothing.
Come on, Phil, let's you
and I get out of the house
for a while.
Kathy won't mind,
and you know Ma's
out of danger now.
You need some air.
I'm going.
I'm going up
to Flume Inn.
What?
I'm going to use
those plane tickets
we had for this afternoon.
I'll be back later.
Phil, what for?
You're wasting
your time.
Sure.
But there must be
a time once when
you fight back, Dave.
I want to make them look me
in the eye and do it.
I want the
satisfaction.
I can't explain it,
but I want to do it
for myself.
Phil, they're nothing
more than...
Let him do it,
Kathy.
You have to face them once.
I did it once at Monterey.
They are more
than nasty little
snobs, Kathy.
You call them that,
and you can dismiss them.
It's too easy.
They're persistent
little traitors
to everything that
this country stands for
and stands on.
You have to fight them.
Not just for the
"poor, poor Jews,"
as Dave says,
but for everything
this country stands for.
Anyway, I'm going.
See you later.
CLERK: I think
you'll find this room more
comfortable, Mrs. Brewster.
Thank you.
I have a reservation,
a double room and bath,
today through Thursday.
In what name, please?
Green. Philip Green.
Yes, Mr. Green.
My wife will be
here tomorrow.
Oh, yes.
One more thing.
Yes?
Is your hotel
restricted?
Well, I'd hardly say
it was restricted.
Then it's not restricted?
Would you excuse me
a moment, please?
(INAUDIBLE)
How do you do,
Mr. Green?
How do you do?
In answer to your question,
may I inquire, are you...
That is, do you
follow the Hebrew
religion yourself,
or is it that you
just want to make sure?
I've asked
a simple question.
I'd like to have
a simple answer.
Well, you see,
we do have a very
high-class clientele,
and, well, naturally.
Then you do restrict
your guests to Gentiles?
Well, I wouldn't
say that, Mr. Green.
But in any event,
there seems to be
some mistake,
because we don't
have a free room
in the entire hotel.
But if you'd like,
perhaps I can fix you up
at the Brewster Hotel,
down near
the station.
I'm not staying
at the Brewster.
Look, I'm Jewish,
and you don't take Jews.
That's it, isn't it?
I never said that.
If you don't
accept Jews, say so.
Don't raise
your voice to me,
Mr. Green.
You speak a little
more quietly, please.
Do you or don't you?
Mr. Green,
I'm a very busy man.
Now, if you want me
to phone for a cab,
or a room at the Brewster,
I'll do so, otherwise...
Otherwise what?
(BELL DINGS)
(DOOR OPENS)
Tommy?
Oh, Phil. Hello.
It was bad.
I can tell
by your face.
Dave was right.
It was a waste of time.
How's Ma?
She's fine.
She's asleep.
Tom's out playing.
Where's Dave?
He's gone out
with Anne.
He packed all afternoon.
They decided to have
a last night on the town.
They'll wind up
here later.
How about some coffee?
No, thanks.
Tired, darling?
No.
I'm just thinking
about Dave.
I suppose you're thinking
about the cottage, Phil.
Yes, I did
think about that.
So have I.
You must know that.
And it wouldn't
work, Phil.
It would just be
too uncomfortable
for Dave,
knowing he'd moved
into one of those
neighborhoods.
Darling, don't you
see that? It's detestable,
but that's the way it is.
It's even worse
in New Canaan.
There, nobody can
sell or rent to a Jew.
And even in Darien,
where Jane's house is
and my house is,
there's sort of
a gentleman's agreement
when you buy...
Gentleman's?
Kathy, you can't...
You're not going
to fight it, Kathy.
You're just going to
give in, play along,
just let their
idiotic rules stand.
I don't play along,
but what can one person do?
You can tell them
to go jump in the lake.
What can they do?
Plenty.
Ostracize him.
Some of the markets
not deliver food,
not even wait on him.
Phil, the series
will be over by
the time we get there.
Phil, face facts.
You expect us to live
in that cottage
once I know all this?
You can't
make over the whole world.
You know I'm on Dave's side.
Well, I'm not on
Dave's side or any side,
except against their side.
Kathy, do you or
don't you believe
in this?
Because if you do,
how can you talk about...
Tom, will you please?
Kathy and I are talking.
But, Pop, I...
Tom, what is it?
What's the matter?
Did you have a fight?
Argument with
one of the guys?
(CRYING) They called me
a dirty Jew and
a stinking kike,
and they all ran off.
Oh, darling,
it's not true.
It's not true.
You're no more Jewish
than I am. It's just
a horrible mistake.
Kathy!
Come with me, Tom.
We'll talk about it
in here.
Take it...
Take it easy, sport.
Want some water?
No, thanks.
Where did it happen?
Jimmy in it?
Somebody sock
somebody?
No. They just yelled.
It was at our corner.
One was a kid
from school.
They were playing hop,
and I asked
could I play, too.
The school one said
no dirty little Jew
could play with them.
And they all yelled
those other things.
I started to speak,
and they all yelled,
"Your father has a long,
curly beard,"
and turned and ran.
Why did they, Pop? Why?
Come on,
drink some of this.
Did you want
to tell them that you
weren't really Jewish?
No.
That's good.
See, there's a lot
kids just like you,
Tommy, who are Jewish,
and if you said it,
it'd be sort of
admitting
that there was
something bad
in being Jewish
and something
swell in not.
They wouldn't fight.
They just ran.
Yeah, I know.
There's a lot of grownups
just like that, too, Tom.
Only they do it
with wisecracks
instead of yelling.
Okay?
Sure.
Attaboy.
You want to go
and read or something
while I talk to Kathy?
Okay.
Oh...
Let's keep this to ourselves
till Grandma's well, huh?
Okay.
Phil, I've got
something to tell you.
I'm pretty tired
of feeling wrong.
Everything I do
or say is wrong
about anything Jewish.
All I did just now
was to face facts
about Dave and Darien,
and to tell Tom
just what you
told him the other...
Not just what.
You've only assured him
that he's the most wonderful
of all creatures,
a white,
Christian American.
You instantly gave him
that lovely
taste of superiority,
the poison that
millions of parents
drop into the minds of
millions of children.
You really do think
I'm an anti-Semite.
No, I don't, Kathy.
You do.
You've thought it secretly
for a long time.
No.
It's just that
I've come to see
that lots of nice
people who aren't,
people who despise it
and detest it and deplore it
and protest
their own innocence,
help it along
and then wonder
why it grows.
People who'd never
beat up a Jew.
Or yell "kike" at a child.
People who think
that anti-Semitism
is something away off
in some dark,
crackpot place
with low-class morons.
That's the biggest
discovery I've made
about this whole
business, Kathy.
The good people,
the nice people.
You mean
you're not going to
Darien this summer
even though
you're finished
by now?
Let's save that
for another time.
I hate it, I hate it,
I hate everything about
this horrible thing!
They always make
trouble for everybody!
Even their friends.
They force people
to take sides
against them.
Quit it! Quit that!
They didn't
suggest this series,
they didn't
give me the angle!
They haven't got
a single thing to do
with what's happened
between you and me.
Don't shout at me.
I know what
you're thinking
about marrying me.
I saw it on your face
when I said that to Tom.
And don't treat me
to any more lessons
of tolerance.
I'm sick of it!
I'm not going
to marry into hothead
shoutings and nerves,
and you might
as well know it now.
Kathy.
I'm sorry I shouted.
I hate it when I do it.
It's not just
the shouting, Phil.
It's everything.
You've changed
since that first night
I met you at Uncle John's.
It's no use, Phil.
Now I know
why I drew back when
you told me the angle.
You're doing
an impossible thing.
You are what you are
for the one life you have.
You can't help it
if you were born
Christian instead of Jewish.
It doesn't mean
you're glad you were.
But I am glad.
There. I've said it.
It'd be terrible.
I'm glad I'm not.
I could never make
you understand that.
You could never
understand that
it's a fact,
like being glad
you're good-looking
instead of ugly,
rich instead of poor,
young instead of old,
healthy instead of sick.
You could never
understand that.
It's just
a practical fact,
not a judgment
that I'm superior.
But I could never
make you see that.
You'd twist it into
something horrible.
A conniving,
an aiding and abetting
a thing I loathe
as much as you do.
It's better to finish it now,
get it over with right now.
I...
I hate you
for doing this.
We could've been
so happy.
We had so much to enjoy
and so much to share.
And I hate you
for taking it away
from both of us.
I hate you for that.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
DAVE: What do you know?
He's asleep. This early.
On your last night?
Nonsense. Come on,
let's wake him up.
Let the poor
guy alone.
It's against my
deepest principles.
Hey, Phil, come on,
wake up. It's us.
Let the poor
lug alone.
I told you,
I never let
any man alone.
Hey, I thought
we were expected,
sleepyhead.
Where's Kathy?
She left early.
My, you look
nice in pajamas.
Get on a dressing gown.
I'll close my eyes
if you're modest.
You go get the ice cubes
so he can get dressed.
He wouldn't let any dame
see his ratty bathrobe.
And he's right.
Go on. Don't trifle
with your luck.
I don't think any man
should ever wear
coats and ties.
They look just wonderful
in shirts and pants
and in pajamas!
What's wrong, Phil?
Skip it.
Flume Inn?
Tommy got called
"dirty Jew" and "kike"
by some kids
down the street.
Came home pretty
badly shaken up.
Now you know it all.
That's the place
they really get
at you, your kids.
Now you even know that.
Well, you can quit
being Jewish now.
There's nothing else.
My own kids got it
without the names, Phil.
Just setting
their hearts
on a summer camp
their bunch were going to
and being kept out.
It wrecked them
for a while.
The only other thing
that makes you
want to murder is...
There was a boy
in our outfit,
Abe Schlussman.
Good soldier.
Good engineer.
One night,
we got bombed,
and he caught it.
I was ten yards off.
Somebody said,
"Give me a hand
with this sheeny."
Those were the last
words he ever heard.
Good morning.
Oh, good morning.
Miss Wales, here it is,
the first three installments,
edited and ready to go.
Send every ten pages
downstairs.
Have it set up
in galley immediately.
Tell them
I'm in a hurry,
a big hurry.
How long is that
much gonna take you?
Well, it's no more
than 10,000 words.
I guess I can have it
finished by tonight.
I am pretty fast.
"I Was Jewish
For Eight Weeks."
Why, Mr. Green,
you're a Christian.
But I never...
Well...
But I've been around you
more than anybody else.
And I never once...
What's so upsetting
about that, Miss Wales?
You mean there is
some difference between
Jews and Christians?
Look at me. Look at me hard.
I'm the same man
I was yesterday.
That's true, isn't it?
Why should you be
so astonished,
Miss Wales?
You still can't believe
that anybody would give up
the glory of being
a Christian for even
eight weeks, can you?
That's what's
eating you, isn't it?
And if I tell you that
that's anti-Semitism,
your feeling that
being Christian is better
than being Jewish,
you're gonna tell me
that I'm heckling you
again,
or that I'm twisting
your words around,
or that it's just
facing facts,
as someone else
said to me yesterday.
Face me now, Miss Wales.
Come on, look at me.
Same face, same eyes,
same nose, same suit,
same everything.
Here. Take my hand.
Feel it!
Same flesh as yours,
isn't it?
No different today
than it was yesterday,
Miss Wales.
The only thing
that's different
is the word Christian.
Of course I'll see him.
Send him right in.
Good morning.
Thanks for seeing me, John.
I'm sorry to break in on you
like this.
I turned
the first half over to
Miss Wales for typing.
I'll finish the rest of it
by the end of the week.
Good.
I want to clear out.
Completely?
Yeah, completely.
Going back
to California?
As soon as
we get packed.
Will the office help me
get train reservations?
Yes. What about
future assignments?
I'll let you know.
(INTERCOM BUZZING)
I don't want to be
disturbed for anything.
Sorry about you two.
Kathy told my wife
this morning.
She seemed pretty upset.
I'd have liked it
to go on, Phil.
It seemed so right,
you two.
Anything I can do?
Can I be of any help?
Talk is useless, I know,
but maybe someone
who knew the both...
Thanks, John.
Thanks a lot.
I'd better be getting back.
I'm clearing out of
the office tonight.
I'll finish
the last three
installments
at home and
I'll bring them in.
We'll have
one more session.
Hey, I'm looking
for you.
It's the gol-darnedest idea
for a series this magazine
has ever run.
No kidding, Green.
I couldn't put
these 10 pages down.
The whole place
is buzzing with it.
Now, about artwork.
Photographic
treatment's my hunch.
What do you think?
Okay. No pictures
of my kid or me or
my mother, understand?
Now, stop pushing me around.
That's the trouble
with you Christians,
you know,
too aggressive,
loud, pushing.
Everybody's got
a copy but me.
When's my turn
to see it, Phil?
The place is in a frenzy
over the wonderful plot.
Though, what plot there
can be to a series on
anti-Semitism escapes me.
This is something.
It's hot, all right.
You fooled me,
Phil, completely.
Though I did want to say
a couple of times,
how have you lived
this long spending this much
juice on it all the time?
I get it now.
Everything.
This is dynamite.
Wait till you
read the rest of it.
Boy, if everybody
would act it out just
one day of the year,
it'd be curtains
on the thing overnight.
Well, I gotta go.
Minify ordered everything
stopped for this.
See you later.
It's a wonderful
notion, Phil.
Congratulations.
Hey, you look
kind of beat.
I worry about you.
I'm fine.
Uh-huh.
It's over with you
and Kathy, isn't it?
Phil, I guessed it
last night,
but I wasn't sure.
It is over,
isn't it?
Everything's so rotten,
Phil. With me, too.
Look, if you're
free tonight,
come on down
to my place
and listen
to my troubles.
How about it?
Okay. Thanks.
We'll have dinner.
Feeling better?
Yeah.
Good.
You almost smiled
a minute ago.
You take your coffee black,
don't you? And one lump.
I remember
from the party.
You do?
You're quite a girl, Anne.
I don't think I told you
that before.
Me? Sure.
Everybody loves Anne.
You said you weren't
very happy. Do you
want to talk about it?
Nothing bores
any man so much as
an unhappy female.
Now, look, Anne,
we're good friends.
Somehow,
even in this
short a time,
we've been through
quite a bit together.
It's been good for me
to be able to be
with you tonight.
I wish you would
talk to me.
All right, I'll talk.
We've been
skirting it
all evening.
Let's bring it out
and clear the air.
Do you mind
if I say something
about you and Kathy?
Let's don't.
All right, Phil.
Mind your manners.
Be a little gentleman.
Don't let the flag
touch the ground.
This sort of honorableness
gets me sick, Phil.
It's just that I think
you're pretty straight,
and she's...
Anne, drop it.
Okay.
I'm a cat
and this is
dirty pool.
But I'm intolerant
of hypocrites.
That's what I said,
Phil. Hypocrites.
She'd rather let Dave
lose that job than
risk a fuss up there.
That's it, isn't it?
She's afraid.
The Kathys
everywhere are afraid
of getting the gate
from their little
groups of nice people.
They make little
clucking sounds
of disapproval,
but they want
you and Uncle John
to stand up and yell
and take sides and fight.
But do they fight?
Oh, no.
Kathy and Harry and
Jane and all of them,
they scold Bilbo
twice a year
and think they've fought
the good fight for
democracy in this country.
(SIGHS)
They haven't got the guts
to take the step
from talking to action.
One little action
on one little front.
Sure, I know it's not
the whole answer,
but it's got to
start somewhere.
And it's got to
be with action,
not pamphlets,
not even with
your series.
It's got to be
with people, nice people,
rich people, poor people,
big and little people.
And it's got to be quick.
But not Kathy.
She can't.
She never will.
She doesn't
rate you, Phil.
Phil, do you hate me
for saying this?
No.
I'd like to say
one thing more
if there's time.
If two people are
right for each other,
they usually
discover it in time.
If I had a kid I loved,
I'd want him to be brought up
with people
who felt the way I did
about the basic things.
You proposing, Anne?
Maybe.
Maybe I am.
Hello.
Oh, Dave. Hello.
Thank you
for coming.
It was good of you.
You know about
Phil and me?
Yes.
I want to ask you
something,
and I want you to
answer me honestly.
Go ahead.
Do you think
I'm anti-Semitic?
No, Kathy, I don't.
Phil does.
Does he?
You know
I'm not anti-Semitic.
You're a Jew,
and you know it.
Why can I make it clear
to everybody but Phil?
Why, I was the one
who suggested the series.
Did you know that?
No, I didn't.
I hate this thing
just as much as he does.
Why can't he see it? Why?
Why, tonight at dinner,
a man told
a vicious little story,
and I was ill,
I was sick with
rage and shame.
But Phil
actually makes...
What kind of story, Kathy?
Oh, it was just a story.
It had nothing...
Well, suppose
you tell me anyway.
Well, it was just
a vulgar little joke
that a man told at dinner.
It has nothing
to do with this.
Well, take it easy, Kathy.
Maybe it has.
What kind of a joke?
I can take
naughty words,
you know.
But why?
Oh, all right.
It was a man
named Lockhardt,
and he tried to get
laughs with words like
"kike" and "coon,"
and I despised him,
and everybody else...
What did you do, Kathy,
when he told the joke?
What do you mean?
I mean, what did you
say when he finished?
I wanted to yell at him.
I wanted to get up and leave.
I wanted to say
to everyone
at that table,
"Why do we sit here and
take it when he's attacking
everything that we believe in?
"Why don't we
call him on it?"
And what did you do?
I just sat there.
I felt ashamed.
We all just sat there.
Yeah.
And then you left
and got me on the phone.
Later, after dinner was over,
I said I was ill, and I am.
I'm sick through.
I wonder if you'd
feel so sick now, Kathy,
if you had nailed him.
There's a funny
kind of elation
about socking back.
I learned that
a long time ago.
Phil's learned it.
And I haven't?
Lots of things are
pretty rough, Kathy.
This is just
a different
kind of a war.
And anybody who
crawls away is a quitter
just as much as...
I didn't say that.
You did.
Somebody told a story.
Sure, a man at
a dinner table
told a story,
and the nice people
didn't laugh.
They even despised
him for it, sure.
But they let it pass.
And behind that joke,
there's Flume Inn
and Darien and Tommy
and those kids...
And if you don't
stop with that joke,
where do you stop?
Is that what you mean?
That's right.
Where do you
call the halt?
I've been
getting mad at Phil because
he expected me to fight this,
instead of getting
mad at the people
who help it along,
like Lockhardt.
Not just old Lockhardt.
At least he's out in the open.
What about the rest
of the dinner guests?
They're supposed
to be on your side.
And they didn't
have to...
No, they didn't,
and I didn't.
That's the trouble.
We never do.
It all links up, Dave.
Phil will fight.
He can fight.
He always will fight.
And if I just sit by
and feel sick,
then I'm not
a fit wife for him.
It was always on those
deeper issues that
we had our quarrels.
Always.
And I never
knew it until now.
Sure.
A man wants
his wife to be more
than just a companion, Kathy,
more than his
beloved girl,
more than even
the mother
of his children.
He wants a sidekick,
a buddy to go through
the rough spots with.
And, well, she has to feel
that the same things
are the rough spots,
or they're always
out of line
with each other.
You're not cast
in bronze, sweetie.
You're nice
and soft and pliable,
and you can do
anything you have to do,
or want to do with yourself.
Can I?
But it's got to be
more than talk.
(DOOR SHUTS)
Now, don't scold, Phil.
I couldn't sleep,
so I sneaked into
your room
and stole
the first two
installments.
Come here.
Thanks, Ma.
I think maybe
I'd rather have that
than almost anything.
I wish your father
could have read this, Phil.
He'd have liked it.
He'd have liked this.
"Driving away from the inn,
I knew all about
every man or woman
"who'd been told the job
was filled when it wasn't.
"Every youngster
who'd ever been
turned down
"by a college
or a summer camp.
"I knew the rage
that pitches
through you
"when you see
your own child
shaken and dazed.
"From that moment,
I saw an unending
attack by adults
"on kids of seven
and eight and 10 and 12.
"On adolescent
boys and girls
trying to get a job
"or an education
or into medical school.
"And I knew that
they had somehow
known it, too.
"They, those patient,
stubborn men
"who argued
and wrote and fought
"and came up with
the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights.
"They knew the tree
is known by its fruit
"and that injustice
corrupts a tree,
"that its fruit
withers and shrivels
"and falls at last
to that dark ground
of history
"where other great hopes
have rotted and died,
"where equality and freedom
remain still the only choice
"for wholeness and soundness
in a man or in a nation."
Your father would
have liked to have
you say that, Phil.
Not enough of us
realize it, Ma.
The time's
getting short.
Not enough people,
and the time's running out.
You mean Kathy?
Well, not just Kathy.
All the Kathys
everywhere.
You know something, Phil?
I suddenly want to
live to be very old.
Very.
I want to be around
to see what happens.
The world is stirring
in very strange ways.
Maybe this is
the century for it.
Maybe that's why
it's so troubled.
Other centuries had
their driving forces.
What will ours have been
when men look far back
to it one day?
Maybe it won't be
the American century
after all,
or the Russian century,
or the atomic century.
Wouldn't it be
wonderful, Phil,
if it turned out to be
everybody's century,
when people
all over the world,
free people,
found a way
to live together?
I'd like to be around
to see some of that,
even the beginning.
I may stick around
for quite a while.

Hi, Dave.
Hello? Mr. Case.
Dave Goldman calling.
I'm sorry to call you
at this late hour,
but I can take that job.
I'm bringing my family
from California immediately.
I've got a house.
Thanks. So am I.
She's going to live up there
all summer at her sister's,
and if anybody
dishes anything out,
she'll be right there
to dish it back.
Yes, sir.
I think I'll stick
around for a long time.
(DOOR SHUTS)
Thanks, Dave.
