...as well as blows from similar
explosions are unfolding...
REPORTER 3: Just a few seconds ago,
another huge blast shook this city.
Cruise missiles and
airstrikes raining down here
in a relentless assault
on Baghdad.
There is no doubt tonight
that war has begun...

target site three-five-niner.
(MAN CHATTERS ON RADIO)
All right, everybody,
listen up.
It is a military
storage site. Diwaniya.
Intel estimates possible
nerve agents, choking agents,
live pathogens,
chemical-tipped missiles.
101 st has been here all
morning, so the site is secure.
Everybody stay focused.
This is it.

(MACHINE GUNS FIRE)
Shots fired, right side,
100 meters, tops.
We got shots fired.
Right side, 100 meters.
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)
(GUNS FIRE)
Let's go.
Move. Move!
Okay. Go ahead.
(SCREAMING)
Who's the officer
in charge?
Move! Move! Move!
Hey! Who's in charge?
Right here.
Lieutenant Asira.
Chief Miller,
Met-Delta.
What the fuck are all
these looters doing here?
This is a WMD site.
This is a high-priority site.
Look, I don't even have enough
men to set up the perimeter.
We got a sniper
in this tower right here.
In the big tower
on the back?
In the big tower
on the back.
I do not have enough men to go in and
secure the inside of that compound.
Listen, listen. Intel says we got
live chemical agents in this site.
Okay, we gotta move
now! These looters...
I don't know what these people
are carrying out right now.
I gotta get into this
site. I'm going in.
Chief, you can't go in.
If you take your team in
right now, it's on you.
Gather around. Gather around. Come
on. Listen, here's the situation.
101 st sent 35 men and
one butter bar down here.
They don't even have
this place secure, so
here's where
we are right now.
Now, the weapons are in the
northwest end of the complex.
There's a sniper holed
up in the big tower there.
We're going to have
to quickly take him out.
I'm going to take a recon element
forward. I'm going to need C-BIST.
Marshall and Johnson, you
come with me. Yes, sir.
Two shooters, Potts, Michaels.
I'm going to need EOD.
Conway, bring Simms also.
Right here, sir.
SOLDIER: Ready, Chief.
All right, stand by.
Chief, I gotta talk to you.
This is fucked.
Listen, this is
a disaster.
It is a disaster.
They haven't secured dick.
I don't think we should go in yet,
Chief. Let's get some acceptable intel.
No, no, no. Look at this! Jerry, I
got no idea what's coming out here.
I gotta go right now.
Keep comms open.
I'll be on five.
Get a second team ready.
WILKINS: Let's go! Move! Move!
Guys, get that shit
off the truck now.
SOLDIER: Roger that.
C- BIST?
Right here, Chief.
I want you to stay right on the
backs of your shooters, all right?
They will take you in.
Roger that, Chief.
All right. We ready?
WILKINS: Yes, sir!
Let's go. Go! Go! Go!
SOLDIER: Move! Move!
The sniper! Hey, Sarge! Where is he?
He's right up there, but
we can't get down the alley.
(ALL SHOUTING)
Okay, everyone,
listen up.
Michaels! Michaels,
listen. Hey!
The WMD are in this building. I need you
to work your way to the rear door here.
See if you can get
an angle on that sniper.
I want you to take C-BIST with you.
Take Simms, also, with the long rifle.
MICHAELS: Got it, Chief.
MILLER: Hey, I gotta get
across this alley.
I need some
cover fire, all right?
Okay.
When the 203 goes, we're going to
go all the way down on the left side.
All right. Stand by.
Roger that, Chief.
MILLER: Let's go.
SOLDIER: Met-Delta team, go!
CONWAY: Move, move! Let's go!
Move! Move!
(PANTING)
MILLER: I got him. He's on the
fifth floor, southeast corner room.
I'm going to draw him out.
As soon as you see him,
take him.
MICHAELS: Roger.
Now! Now! Now!
Got him?
We got him.
Three coming out.
MILLER: Michaels,
send C-BIST over.
Go! Go! Go!
Potts, Keating, go! Go!
Second team, move!
Let's go! Move! Move!
WILKINS: Move it!
In.
SOLDIER: Check. Check.
Let's do it.
All right. Break out the gear.
I want everyone in full MOPP.
WILKINS: Now you heard Chief.
Get ready. Roll those seals tight.
I got it.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(ELECTRONIC BEEPING)
CONWAY:
No readings in here, Chief.
MILLER: All right,
Conway, open it up.
(METALLIC CLANGING)
SOLDIER: Nothing but
toilet parts over here.
Is this all pigeon shit?
PERRY: Yeah, thing looks like
it's been here about 10 years.
MILLER: Yep.
This is no WMD site.
SOLDIER: Pack it up.
WILKINS: Hey, Chief,
we find anything?
The site's empty.
WILKINS: Standing by.
(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)
Hey, where did that
intel come from?
Do you want me to double check the
target number for you? Because I can.
No, no, we're in the right
location. The schematic's right.
But who did it
originate with? I mean...
Hey, did this come
from the United Nations?
According to this data,
Chief, this is our intel.
Yeah, but how would they
think something was there?
This is the third
straight time.
Let's go.
WILKINS: You heard the chief. Move out.
All right, pack this shit up
and let's go.
SOLDIER: Roger that!
Let's go! Move!
SOLDIER: Step on it. Let's go.
Zubaidi will be on the middle
chopper. Get tight on his exit.
(CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)
Swing it around.
Swing it around.
REPORTER 1: The DOD
guy's here to meet him.
MALE REPORTER: Reporting to
you live from the tarmac here...
REPORTER 1: Ready for the
close-up? Go, go, go!
REPORTER 2:
That's Poundstone from DOD.
How's it going?
Great day.
LAWRIE: Yup, you finally got him here.
Well, we feel like we're making
progress. That's important.
So, what about
the weapons?
I'm frustrated by that, too.
We're doing everything we can. We'll
find the weapons, don't worry about it.
The whole world's watching.
They want to know where they are.
Make sure Zubaidi and I
are in the lead car, okay?
Jack, I want
your guys to tail us.
You got it, sir.
Clark!
What?
I need the source.
I need Magellan.
Do you have any idea
how sensitive this is?
We've got Magellan locked up so tight,
I'm not even sure I can get to him.
You're the administration's go-to guy
and you can't access your own source?
Lawrie, we're
debriefing him.
It takes time.
That comes first.
For Christ's sake, I've given you
everything I got on the guy so far.
What more do you want? I
don't want to hear it from you,
I want to hear it from him.
I'll see what I can do.
How are you?
Welcome home, sir.
We'll make this very brief.
REPORTER 1: How does it
feel to be back, Mr. Zubaidi?
Did you ever think
you'd see this day?
I'm an Iraqi citizen, returning
free to the city of my birth.
I call on all Iraqis to celebrate
our liberation from tyranny.
SOLDIER: Bravo one, we've got
two mechanics taking a look at it.
Tracking on the upgun
is pretty well shot
and the comm links
are all shorted out.
What's the time frame
on a replacement?
(CHATTER ON RADIO CONTINUES)
(ALL TALKING)
MAN: I want
a squad list, now!
Hey, where's Colonel Bethel?
He's in the back, Chief.
Thank you.
WILKINS: Roy, let me
meet you over here, okay?
Yeah, I'll meet you
in there.
Hey, sir.
Good to see you, Chief.
What's going on
with the intel?
You don't want to get
into that right now.
Well, we gotta talk about it. There's
nothing there. These sites are empty.
We're going to
be very careful,
or there's going to be a
huge shitstorm around here.
What do you mean?
They're blaming us
for not moving fast enough.
We have to stay on task.
That's bullshit.
The intel's no good.
Let's not make
any waves, okay?
They don't want to hear
that back in Washington.
All they're interested in is finding
something they can hold up on CNN.
Sir, but we gotta talk about
this. The intel is a problem.
Now is not
the time, Chief.
OFFICER: Roo!
On your feet!
Take your seats, people.
BETHEL: We're here this
morning to give the General
a check on where we are
in our search for WMD
and what our plans
are for the next 48 hours.
To that end, I'm turning the floor
over to Captain Jonathan Vaught.
Captain.
Sir.
Welcome, sir.
Today we're going to be briefing you
on WMD operations due to take place
in and around the Baghdad area
over the next 24 hours.
We're continuing to target
high-priority sites,
since all the folks back home are
anxiously awaiting the information
that we found these weapons.
We have a detailed media plan
we've worked out.
We've coordinated
with the public-affairs folks.
We have a good plan that
involves the top-rated media
in the United States
and the UK
so that they're prepared to cover
all aspects of the good news.
Yeah?
I had a couple questions
about the intel
for tomorrow.
Are we sure
this is accurate?
It's solid.
It's good to go.
What's the source?
GONZALES: Well, it's
a human-source intel.
But it's solid.
It's current as of 0400.
Was it the same source
we've been using?
Every site we've hit on the way
up here, we've rolled a donut.
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
Chief, how about we do this?
Let's talk offline.
Give me a list of the places
where you went, and the grids,
and we'll make sure that you had
the right information written down
and that you went to
the right places, okay?
Captain, the issue isn't the grids, sir.
The issue's that there's nothing there.
Stand down, Chief.
We need to move on here.
Don, hold on. Hold a second. Let's
hear what the chief has to say.
Okay, sir,
I'll give you an example.
We rolled into a site,
Diwaniya, last week, okay?
101 st took casualties
securing it for us.
We got in there and found
it was a toilet factory.
I'm saying
there's a disconnect
between what's in these packets
and what we're seeing on the ground.
There's a problem
with the intelligence, sir.
Here's the thing, Chief.
These intelligence packages
have all been vetted.
They're good.
Your job's to execute them, not
worry about how they're put together.
Are we clear on that?
Yes, sir.
Good. Let's continue.
VAUGHT: Sir, as I was saying, the
intel is as recent as 0400 this morning.
It's actionable
and it's solid.
All right, next up is
Al Mansour, Baghdad.
It looks like it's some kind
of underground storage site.
You got about 12 klicks of
open highway to the city,
but there's a lot
of activity on that road,
so tell everybody
to keep their heads up.
All right.
Chief?
All right. We're going to go chem. Yeah?
I'm gonna get all the
lead teams up, all right?
Yeah, yeah.
Martin Brown, CIA.
Roy Miller.
Yeah, I know. I saw you at the meeting.
You're going to the Al
Mansour site in Baghdad.
Yeah.
You're wasting your time.
UN biological team
hit it two months ago.
There's nothing there.
Fuck me.
Here's my card.
You're right.
This thing doesn't add up.
The Iraqis don't fight,
they don't use WMD,
they let us walk in here and
find the goddamn cupboard's bare.
There's something
wrong here.
We gotta figure
out what it is.
If you find anything,
you've got my number.
SOLDIER ON RADIO: That's
affirmative. That's affirmative.
We took on some fire
about four klicks back.
Pretty light, though.
Nothing to worry about.
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)
JOHNSON: Oh, I gotta get
some pictures of this.
POTTS: Be my guest.
Heads up. Incoming.

you red-headed dick.

Hey, Wilkins, this
is Chief. Get up here.
WILKINS: Hold on!
Yo, Kurry, let's go.
Please, get back. Please.
I want you to get a couple of the
guys and clear out this traffic.
We're too exposed out here.
We gotta keep moving.
Back from the truck.
Sir, take it easy.
Please.
Please, step aside.
I need you to move
the vehicle, sir.
Hey, hey, relax.
Easy!
SOLDIER: Don't you
fucking touch me!
(ALL SHOUTING LOUDER)
Motherfucker, let's go.
Hey!
SOLDIER: Shut the fuck up.
Back the fuck up!
Hey! Hey! Hey,
hey, hey, hey!
What's going on, Sergeant?
Chief, they're pissed off.
They say there ain't no
water. All they want is water.
MILLER: There's nothing
we can do about that.
We just gotta get
our vehicles moving.
I want you to get the men
back in the vehicles now.
Hey! Hey! SOLDIER:
Get in the fucking car!
Get the fuck back! Get the
fuck back in your vehicle!
Back from the truck.
Get back from the truck.
(HONKING)
Don't stop.
DRIVER: No, sir.
(SHOUTING IN ARABIC)
Okay, so we're convening
an Iraqi Freedom convention
here inside
the Green Zone tomorrow.
We are expecting to have representatives
from all three main ethnic groups,
the Kurds, the Shia and the Sunni,
angling for different levels of power.
It is our hope
that Ahmed Zubaidi
will emerge in
a leadership position.
Ben, are you satisfied that
we're in a good place now?
I think we're
in a good place now,
except for, perhaps, the press we're
getting from this looting issue.
Okay, well,
let's table that for now.
In terms of stabilization...
Zubaidi hasn't been
here for 30 years.
Well, he's the best bet we have
right now for a stable democracy.
You find me 10 guys in Baghdad
who even know who he is.
Well, he's our friend, Marty.
He's been very helpful.
Our office is
extremely satisfied
with all the information
that we've gotten from him.
Zubaidi's been selling us
a crock of shit for years.
This guy is not reliable. His
intelligence is not reliable.
His report chain
is not reliable.
This is exactly why people are losing
confidence in the Agency, Marty.
You're questioning every single piece
of intelligence that's coming in,
up to the point where
we can't make any progress.
You cannot just hand this country
over to an exile no one's ever heard of
and a bunch of interns
from Washington.
Well, you're
a Middle East expert, Marty.
If you got a better idea, why don't
you just throw it out here on the table?
We need to use the
Iraqi army to help us.
This country is a powder
keg of ethnic division.
Now Saddam is gone, they're the only
ones who can hold this place together.
We're not selling that
to the American people.
We beat the Iraqi army.
Right.
Well, they're still out
there and they're armed,
and they're looking for
a place in the new Iraq.
They're going to be
waiting a long time.
They didn't all
follow Saddam.
There are officers
we can work with out there,
if we make it
worth their while.
Hey, let me tell
you something.
We've spent too
much American treasure
and too many American lives
for us to put a Ba'athist
general into a position of power.
Have you any idea what's going
on outside the Green Zone?
It's chaos. No police,
revenge killings every night.
People are asking
why we can't stop this.
We are losing the population.
Democracy is messy.
Democracy is messy.
If you dismantle this country
and cut out the army,
you'll have civil war
in six months.
I guarantee it.
Okay, let's move on.

Are you finished?
Yeah, I'm finished.
What's your name?
My name is Farid Youssef Abdul
Rahman. You call me Freddy, okay?
I have information. I was driving
like five minutes from here.
I saw some people, you know, like
Saddam's men, like Ba'athist people.
They are meeting. They
have a meeting near to here.
I saw you are... I don't
know, you're digging here,
and I come to tell you. Okay,
just calm down. Hey! Hey! Hey!
Calm down. Calm down.
Why should I believe
you, Freddy?
You think it's easy to come
and talk to American?
You think it's easy? I come here, all
these people, they're looking at me?
You stick me on the floor. I
want to speak to you quietly, huh.
And you are
digging in the ground.
Why you are digging
in the ground?
You need to talk to these people.
You know what they are saying?
You think someone can put
something in this place
with all these people watching
and all these people don't know?
It's not logical.
I am here to help you,
okay, Miller?
Come with me, Freddy.
Come with me.
WILKINS: Chief, you good?
Yeah, I'm fine.
SOLDIER: Sir, come
this way, please.
Hey, Chief! Chief,
what are we doing?
Hey, I'm gonna need his car keys.
Freddy, give him your car keys.
My keys?
Chief, you don't believe
this guy, do you?
Look, I wanna go
real low-vis on this.
I want to take Freddy's car and
I want to get maybe one other.
If we roll over there in those
Humvees, they're going to see us coming.
I want to take Keating,

You gotta get me Michaels with

What's up, Chief?
Hey, you guys

Hell, yeah, Chief.

What?

here's the situation.
This Iraqi just showed
up with information
that about two
or three "K" west of here,
there's a meeting
taking place right now,
possible high-value
targets involved.
So I want to move on it.
In the first car, I want to
take the Iraqi guy, Freddy.
Keating, you're going
to drive, I'll ride shotgun.
Potts, you're in the back
covering Freddy the entire time.
The rest of you guys are going to roll
in the pick-up truck. Any questions?
Hey, Chief, how do we know this guy
isn't leading us into a fucking ambush?
We don't.
Get your fucking game face on.

Okay, be advised, it is the

Someone's coming out.
There were six or
seven men with guns.

Perry, where are you?
You in position?
PERRY: In position,
Chief. We got them.
Black BMW with three men.

I want to take the BMW.
As soon as he comes up our

I want to take the BMW and

His name's Seyyed Hamza.
Seyyed Hamza.
Is this his house?
Is this your house?
Hey, listen, tell him he's
gonna answer my questions
or things are going to go
very bad for him.
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
Ask him what the
meeting was about.
Chief, I just got
off the phone.
That license plate belongs
to General Mohammed Al Rawi.
The Jack of Clubs.
MICHAELS: Shut the fuck up!
Hey, Michaels, do you
have that deck of cards?
Yes.
MILLER: Give me
the Jack of Clubs.
POTTS: Is that the guy? Was that
the guy that went out the back?
MICHAELS: Here it is, Chief.
Let me see. Let me see.
POTTS: Is that the guy? That's

Bullshit!
That's the fucking guy.
I just saw him downstairs.
This man. This is
Saddam's top general.
Al Rawi? You know
who this is? Al Rawi?
He say he don't know.
Al Rawi's in this house?
This is the guy I saw.

Okay, okay. Time's up. Okay, get

Bring them all
over to the wall.
Potts, I want you to get the guy.
Get the guy and bring him to me.
Roger that, Chief.
Just sit him down against
the wall. Yes, sir.
Sit those guys
over there.
MILLER: Come over here, Freddy.
Come here. I need you to translate.
Tell him I want to know about
weapons of mass destruction.
(TRANSLATING)
Does he know where
the weapons are?
What? What? What do
you know about weapons?
Where are the weapons?
He say only General Mohammed Al
Rawi, he know about these things.
The special program
is under his hand personally.
He's the only one who know
the truth about these things.
Okay, how do
I find Al Rawi?
How do I find Al Rawi?
He said, can you
protect his family?
"If you protect my family, I will
tell you how you find Mohammed.
"And then from him
you will know the truth."
Okay, he's got a deal.
Ask him about the book.
What is it? Is it codes?
Is it diagrams? Maps?
(HELICOPTERS APPROACHING)
What the fuck?
All right, Scotty,
head on down there.
Shorty, bag them and
parade them. Yes, sir.
Hey, you Miller?
Yeah.
Where are the other two?
Two what?
We're missing two pucks.
Anybody got eyes on the
other two pucks? No, no, no!
These are my guys. Hold on.
Hold on. These are my prisoners.
BRIGGS: My prisoner now.
Hey! That's my translator!
That's my translator!
What the fuck is going on?
I got a colonel
waiting on these guys.
I got orders to get
these guys back there.
They're en route right now.
Hey, white bread,
calm down.
This goes way up higher
than your people, all right?
Please, stand right there.
Come on.
That prisoner's ours.
Well, he's mine now. Let's go.
SEYYED: Take care
of my family!
What they are doing?
I did nothing!
The book!
He's got my book!
WILKINS: Chief,
what the fuck's going on?
Fuck!
Yeah, I got him. He says
some guy took a book off him.
Book? All right, all right.
Notebook.
He says something
about a book.
His what?
You got his book. He says
you got his fucking book.
Do you have the guy's
notebook? Don't fuck around.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Get your fucking
hands off me, asshole.
(ALL SHOUTING)
Just give me the
fucking book, Miller.
All right.
BRIGGS: I fucking
asked you nicely!
Fuck you! I don't have a fucking book!
Have a nice war.
All right,
let's get out of here!
Get off me!
Hey!
Where's Freddy?
SOLDIER: You mean the
guy with the limp? Yeah.
He went over
by the alleyway.
WILKINS: Fuck! I thought you
were watching him.
Where's my weapon? Where's
my weapon? Right here!
I gave him the book.
I gave him the fucking book!
WILKINS: Potts, Michaels, go with
him now! Go! Let's go! Let's go!
Bronner, hey! Come on!
MICHAELS: Moving!
WILKINS: Go! Go!
(HUMVEE HONKING)
Go around!
Seal it! Seal it!
WILKINS: You got it, Chief!
MICHAELS: Get him, Potts.
Go left!
Go, seal it, seal it.
I got him! Stop!
POTTS: Stop!
MILLER: Get him!
Get him! Get him!
(SHOUTING IN ARABIC)
What the fuck! What the fuck!
What the fuck! Why are you running?
Why you are chasing me?
Give me the book.
Give me the fucking book!
Here the book.
Here the book.
Why are you... What you are doing?
I was going to bring the book back.
The man is putting Iraqis in the
helicopter. He hit you in the face.
What you want me to do?
What I have to do
for you to believe me?
Get everyone
back to the trucks.
POTTS: Roger.
Hey, let's go.
Let's go.
What more I have to do
for you? Huh?
I come to you with information. You
take the information, it's right.
You want the book. I have
the book. I give you the book.
You think I can
leave my car?
You know what this car,
it means to me?
Even you have the key!
(PANTING)
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
What happened to your leg?
My leg is in Iran.
Since 1987.
Me, too, I fight
for my country.
Freddy, listen. You
give me your information.
I'm going to get you a
reward for what you did today.
Reward?
You think I do
this for money?
You think I don't care about my
country? I see what's happening.
You don't think I see
what's happen in it?
And all the people now,
even they have no water,
they have no electricity.
You think I do this
for reward?
You don't think
I do this for me?
For my future? For my
country? For all these things?
Whatever you want here,
I want more than you want.
I want to help my country.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Who is this?
Hey, this is Chief Miller.
I have something I think
you'd be interested in.
MARTIN: Listen, I don't have time to
play games. Just tell me what you've got.
Well, this morning I came face
to face with Mohammed Al Rawi.
General Al Rawi?
Yeah, the Jack of Clubs.
MARTIN: Come in
and talk to me.
I'm in the Green Zone,
Republican Palace. By the pool.
I'm on my way. WILKINS: Listen,
make sure Johnson runs checks...
Hey, Sergeant Wilkins,
I gotta talk to you.
We gotta go get our prisoner
back, find this guy, Al Rawi.
Let Bethel handle it, please.
No. Bethel can't see past
the files on his desk.
So, what, you're going to ring
the doorbell now
and ask Special Forces
to hand him over? No.
I'm going to use the book and
trade up and get some help.
What are you
talking about?
Jerry, why the fuck do we keep
coming up empty on all these sites?
There has gotta
be a reason.
Chief, we're here to do
a job and get home safe.
That's all.
The reasons don't matter.
They matter to me.
With all due respect, Chief,
I can't go with you on this.
Understood. I'm going
to split the team.
I'm going to take my crew
plus Sergeant Perry.
You report back to Bethel
with everyone else, hooah?
Hooah.
Hey, Freddy.
You want a job?
Yes.
Good. Get in your car,
follow us.
DRIVER:
Where to, Chief?
Republican Palace.
This is not
a good time, Lawrie.
I've waited
long enough.
I told you,
I'm doing the best I can.
This is not what
I signed up for, Clark.
I put my reputation on the
line with these stories.
I am not going to let
you hang me out to dry.
Well, there's huge
things at stake here.
I'm not going to let them be compromised
because you need to sell some newspapers.
You knew the deal. I give you
Magellan, you give me anonymity.
Listen, Clark, I'm done
waiting, so is the paper.
You won't help me find Magellan,
I'm going to find someone who can.
Right here.
(CHATTER ON RADIO)
TOURIST: Can you get me
some more beers? Frisbee!
MILLER: Oh, shit!
(LAUGHING)
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Oh, my goodness.
We got enough time for that?
These guys got Domino's
Pizza and fucking beer?
TOURIST: Get in the pool, man.
Sergeant Perry, I've gotta
go talk to this guy,
so you all are on your own
for a little while.
Roger that.
Can we have beer?
PERRY: Not one.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
So, what happened?
We were digging at a site.
Local come up to us and give us a
tip that there was a meeting going on
with some high-value
targets nearby.
We hit the house, and it turned out
the guy was right. Al Rawi was there.
You sure it was him?
Positive.
He had a security detail with him,
and we exchanged fire with them
and he slipped out
during the firefight.
Now that's the book that I
took off this guy, Seyyed Hamza.
He was the host
of the meeting.
And I was in the process of
figuring out what the fuck it was
when SF showed up
and snatched him.
God damn!
Okay, but where
did they take him?
Because if you can get me
access to this guy,
I'll get Al Rawi.
Look, we're both
after the WMD, right?
It's a little more
complicated than that.
Well, not to me, it isn't.
All right, I'll make a
call, get you reassigned.
There are some empty buildings
on the other side of the compound.
Get out of uniform and report
to my office in an hour.
Outstanding.
How'd you get
the bloody nose?
Oh, that's a long story.
You're in the 85th.
That's WMD unit, right?
How did you know that?
It's right there
on your rifle.
Lawrie Dayne, Wall Street
Journal. How's it going?
You know, we haven't found
shit yet. Hey, Sergeant Perry.
We'll find it.
It's frustrating, right?
Little bit.
So what are you
and Marty talking about?
Oh, you know I can't
talk to you about that.
Oh, come on.
You come in fresh off the field to
have a lemonade with Martin Brown?
Something's gotta be going on.
Well, you could ask him.
I'm asking you.
Does it make sense to you that
we're still coming up empty?
No. No, it doesn't.
Someone told us
they were there, right?
If you come
across anything,
call me.
I'll keep it in mind.
INTERROGATOR: Where's he
hiding? Where's Al Rawi?
(SEYYED SOBBING)
TRANSLATOR:
Where's Al Rawi?
How long have
they been going?
For about 10 minutes.
INTERROGATOR: You want to see your
wife and kids again? You have five kids.
You want them
to see their father?
TRANSLATOR: He says, "Please, do not
involve my family in this situation."
(PLEADING IN ARABIC)
"I swear to God..."
INTERROGATOR: You're involved,
so your family's involved.
All I want is an answer,
where to look for this man,
and you can walk out of here.
Where's Al Rawi?
TRANSLATOR: Where's Al Rawi?
INTERROGATOR: And I want
a name or an address.
Somewhere I can find
General Al Rawi.
I am going
to get an answer,
and you know you're going
to tell me something.
All right, I'm going to let go and
you're going to give me an address.
(SEYYED COUGHING)
Where's Al Rawi?
Where is he?
The book! The book!
TRANSLATOR:
He says you need the book.
The fucking book again?
What's in the book?
TRANSLATOR: "The book,
that's how you'll find him."
It has the names and locations
of Al Rawi's safe houses.
Chief Miller around?
Yeah. Up the stairs,
down on the right.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Hey, Chief, Clark Poundstone,
Pentagon Special Intelligence Unit.
A great job bagging Hamza.
Thanks. Appreciate it.
Walk you out?
Sure.
You're with our MET Team, right? Yeah.
Well, the administration really
appreciates the work you guys are doing.
We gotta get this WMD
issue behind us
so we can get on with the
challenges of the future.
That's where this Hamza
guy could be helpful.
He's confirmed
a few facts for us.
Says your guys might have
lifted a notebook from him.
Well, everything I got off
him I gave to Martin Brown.
Why don't you ask him
if he's got it?
(CHUCKLES) I don't think
Marty would go for that.
He's a hell of a guy, but he's
been in the Middle East a long time.
He's got a lot of
preconceived ideas.
Our unit's trying to get
back to the raw intel.
Look, I don't want
to throw Marty under a bus,
but he doesn't like
what we're coming up with.
The guy's a dinosaur,
and we need to get some new
thinking going on around here.
There's an opportunity
for you here, Miller.
I know Marty's pulled
you in temporarily,
but if you're looking for something
more permanent, I can help.
We're doing a good thing here.
We're going to rebuild this place.
People are watching us.
I'll keep it in mind.
You do that.
If you hear anything about
that notebook, let me know.
Your friend from the Pentagon Special
Intelligence Unit came to see me.
Poundstone?
Yeah, Poundstone.
Poundstone's unit pushed all that WMD
intel you've been chasing your tail on.
What? You mean Magellan?
Who is Magellan?
Have you ever met him?
No.
Poundstone's got him
locked up tight.
That's why we gotta
find out what's going on.
Here's the deal.
We checked the notebook.
It's a list of addresses
around Baghdad, mostly Adhamiya.
It's a Sunni stronghold,
very sympathetic to the army.
More than likely,
that's where Al Rawi is.
The notebook's probably his
line to his battalion commanders.
We all set?
Not yet. We're waiting
on military support.
Push them hard. I want to get
every address in that book.
MILLER: So, what do you think
that meeting was about?
What would you be talking
about if you just got invaded?
You think Al Rawi
wants to fight?
If we don't make him
an offer, he will.
What? You're going
to cut a deal?
You're going to cut a deal
with the Jack of Clubs?
What do you think
you're doing here, Miller?
You're off reservation
for a reason. What is it?
Well, I came to find
weapons and save lives.
And I didn't find shit.
I want to know why.
There are no easy answers. If you
want that, go work with Poundstone.
All we got is hard choices.
You want to know what
happened to the weapons?
We gotta find Al Rawi
and bring him in.
He'll give us
the truth about WMD
and give us a shot at standing
this country up without a bloodbath.
Do you want the job or not?
Yeah, I want it.
Good.
Hamza's being held at the high-value
target wing at Camp Cropper.
Poundstone's unit
have him under wraps.
So, how are you going
to get to him?
I'm not. You are.
Here's a pass.
We've got another prisoner
there we can use to get you in.
Low-level Republican Guard,
way below their radar.
Use him as an excuse
to get to Hamza.
Here's a million
dollars in cash.
Tell Hamza the money's his
if he gives us what we need.
You tell him if
he gives Al Rawi to me,
keeps his mouth shut over
there until I bring him in,
I'll have him and his family out of
the country by the end of the week.
You want me to tell him to not
talk to the American interrogators?
That's right.
I thought we were
all on the same side.
Don't be naive.
(MAN MAKING PA ANNOUNCEMENTS)
POUNDSTONE: Miller.
Pentagon just
revoked your transfer.
You're being released back to
your unit, effective immediately.
You chose the wrong side.
Follow me, Freddy.
We gotta move fast.
GUARD: Where do you think you're going?
AIDE: Let us through.
Step aside, please.
(CLAMORING)
What the hell are you
playing at? Get me Langley.
You are required
to hand over all information.
White House authorization.
I want the book.
DC's got too much riding on this to have
you and some Ba'athist generals fuck it up.
Martin.
Langley confirms.
I've got it!
AIDE: Let's go.
Stay out of this, Marty.
MAN 1: You all right here?
MAN 2: Yeah.
(MAN MAKING PA ANNOUNCEMENTS)
Use local assets.
It's high priority.

OGA.
I'm here to see
a prisoner.
Heads up, Sarge.
Hey, Sergeant.
Hello, sir.
I'm here to see
Abdullah Ferat.
I'm gonna have
to search your bag.
What's up with Hajji?
He's my translator.
Arms up,
legs apart.
(COMMENTATORS TALKING ON TV)
Check it out.
GUARD: What's that
in your pocket?
FREDDY: It's my cigarettes.
Good to go.
Here you go, sir.
Go ahead and take
them back to IR-1.
(MEN SHOUTING)
Right here.
That's not
necessary, Sergeant.
Standard procedure, sir.
(PANTING)
Sergeant, I have to have a classified
conversation with the prisoner.
You can go on
and step outside.
GUARD: Roger, sir.
Be right outside.
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
Do you know why
they brought him here?
He's here because he's in
the Republican Guard, Freddy.
Hey, Sergeant.
Hey, listen, this guy just
gave us a piece of intel.
You apparently have a prisoner in
your HVT wing here named Seyyed Hamza.
He can ID him for me.
I gotta get him down here
and ID him real quick.
You're going to need
an EJ-75 for that, man.
Guys, I got a live op going.
I got a team in place ready to move
on a target. I gotta do this now.
How long will it take?
Two minutes.
Just two minutes? That's
it. Two minutes. Come on.
All right. Good, let's go. Hey, Freddy.
(DOG BARKING)
GUARD: Put those bags
on their heads.
GUARD: OGA coming in
for an ID check.
(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY)
Hey, Hamza.
Get up.
(SEYYED COUGHING)
(EXCLAIMING IN ARABIC)
Shit.
Get a medic!
I said, get a medic!
Hey, get the medics on the
phone. We've got a situation here.
(MURMURING IN ARABIC)
He say, "Why did you
do this to me?"
He say the general did everything
you ask of him in the meeting.
What do you...
What meeting?
What meeting?
He just say Jordan.
GUARD: Clear the way!
Clear the way!
FREDDY: What is going on here, Miller?
GUARD: Coming through! Okay.
FREDDY: What does
he mean, "Jordan"?
MEDIC: We gotta stop the
bleeding. His pulse is weak.
(DOGS WHIMPERING)
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
(MAN CHATTERS ON RADIO)
(PEOPLE CHATTING)
I need to talk to you
about Magellan.
I'm going to call you
right back.
What you got?
I read your articles.
You said an Iraqi WMD
source named Magellan
met with US officials
prior to the war.
I need to know
about that meeting.
Oh, no. Come on, Miller. I can't
discuss my sources with you.
Well, did you ever meet the
guy? Do you know who he is?
Of course I didn't meet him. He's
an Iraqi internal, for Christ's sake.
Then how do you know
what he's saying is true?
Because I made contact through
a reliable intermediary.
Reliable?
Yes.
Have you ever even been
to any of Magellan's sites?
You ever been
to Diwaniya? Tikrit?
(CLEARING THROAT) No.
There's nothing there.
Magellan's intel
is bullshit.
(SIGHS)
Who's the intermediary?
No. I'm not discussing
sources, Miller.
Jesus Christ! This is
the reason we went to war!
All right, then at least
tell me how it happened.
How does this happen?
How does somebody like you
write something that's not true?
Tell me!
What do you know?
Look, I got a phone call one
day from a senior official in DC.
He says,
"I've got a story for you.
"The truth about
Saddam's WMD programs."
So I go to meet him.
He puts the source
report in my hands.
Magellan's product,
the raw intel.
But when do you
check the story?
He was a senior official,
for Christ's sake.
He had access
to Magellan's debrief.
All he asked was that I not
disclose the location of the meeting.
The location.
Yes, in case I'd
compromise the source.
It was Jordan, wasn't it?
The meeting was in Jordan.
Yes.
(PEOPLE TALKING)
You can keep
your million dollars.
Al Rawi's Magellan.
They're debriefing Magellan.
They've got him held tight.
Supposing they don't?
John, take care
of the money.
Hamza said Al Rawi met
US officials in Jordan.
Now Dayne said the same
thing about Magellan.
That's more
than a coincidence.
Maybe. It doesn't
make any sense.
If Poundstone met Al Rawi
in Jordan, what's he hiding?
Well, what if he told him
something he didn't wanna hear?
What if he told him
there were no WMD?
I want Al Rawi's
movements outside Iraq.
January, February, 2003.
Anything you got.
CIA TECH: I'm on it.
It all makes sense.
The bad intel.
Why our teams came up
empty at those sites.
Maybe we're looking at this
thing the wrong way around.
It's a theory.
You've got no proof.
Don't be naive.
Sir, Mohammed Al Rawi was in
Amman, Jordan on February 5th, 2003.
That's three days before
Magellan came online.
Give me Clark Poundstone's
movements, same period.
CIA TECH: Sir, we've got a DOD
Gulfstream on the same date.
Passenger Clark Poundstone routed
Washington, DC to Amman, Jordan.
Martin, we're getting reports of
an attack on an Al Rawi safe house.
South Adhamiya.
Poundstone's hunting Al Rawi. He
doesn't want the truth to get out.
I need to know where
the next safe house is.
(ELECTRONIC BEEPING)
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
All clear, Chief.
Send Freddy!
SOLDIER: Yes, sir!
Freddy, on the move.
Freddy, I need you
to translate.
Tell him I need to get a
message to General Al Rawi.
(TRANSLATING)
MILLER: Tell him I need
to meet Al Rawi tonight.
(PHONES RINGING)
Chief Miller on the
phone for you, sir.
Yeah?
MILLER: I got him.
Tahir al-Malik, one of Al
Rawi's battalion commanders.
Where is he?
I let him go.
Look, I told him to get
a message to Al Rawi.
I told him I'd meet him at the
Adhamiya bus station tonight.
If I can bring him in alive,
then we'll have our proof.
If he talks, then we'll
get the truth about WMD.
All right, if you get in front of Al
Rawi, offer him whatever you have to.
If you pull this off,
there's still a chance we can
hold this place together.
I'm headed there now.
You are serious to do a
deal with Mohammed Al Rawi?
You know what already
he do to this country?
We're just trying
to save lives, Freddy.
There are people who think
he can stop an insurgency.
All right, listen up,
we're going to Adhamiya.
But look, we're going alone,
so weapons check, comms check.
Make sure you're 100%.
We got no support.
Hooah?
ALL: Hooah!
You okay? Sergeant P,
can I get a radio check?
SOLDIER 1: Go to one.
Miller, what you are doing?
SOLDIER 2: Channel one.

Son of a bitch. He's on

All right, what do
you want me to do?
Follow Miller. He'll
lead you right to him.
And when you find Al Rawi, you
take that son of a bitch out.
What about Miller?
He's off reservation.
Miller can't bring in Al Rawi.
Don't let him
get in the way.
I want to make
that announcement.
Now?
Just make it happen!
This is Vanguard 6

and status?
Vanguard 6, we're five blocks
south of the Adhamiya bus station.
Kidnappers heading
east in two small cars.
Roger that.
Met-D, I am en route.
I need you to return to your vehicles
and await further instructions.
Falcon 16,
this is Vanguard 6.
We have a US soldier abducted. We
need eyes on those vehicles now!
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.
Currently two klicks
northeast of Adhamiya.
Establishing an area of
perimeter and sweeping Adhamiya.
AOR 87, Alpha Tango.
MARTIN: We gotta
get him out of there.
Get me Chief Miller now.
(PHONE RINGING)
(SHOUTING IN ARABIC)
(FEEDBACK RINGING)
They've taken him. God
damn it! They've taken him.
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.
I've got your two
vehicles moving rapidly.
The two vehicles
just entered a garage.
There's a large water tower
on top of the building.
Grid Kilo-Zulu-8732-6428.
Alpha 1, I'm going in on foot.
Continue to target. Acknowledge.
This is Alpha 1. We're three
klicks from target area.
All right, put us down.
Find an LZ a klick from here.
(SHOUTING IN ARABIC)
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
Who are you?
General, my name's
Roy Miller.
I'm a chief warrant
officer with the US Army.
What do you want?
I came here to bring you in.
General, I'm aware that you
had contact with a US official
in the weeks
leading up to the war.
I know you were ready to tell them
everything about Iraq's WMD programs.
What programs?
There are no programs.
I told your official.
We dismantled
everything after '91.
He told my government that you confirmed
that the programs were still active.
He lied about what you said.
That's why we're here.
Did anyone verify
his story?
No.
Your government wanted
to hear the lie, Mr. Miller.
They wanted Saddam out, and they
did exactly what they had to do.
This is why you are here.
Go.
BRIGGS: Alpha 1, this is
Vanguard 6. Give me your location.
Vanguard 6,
this is Alpha 1.
We're half a klick away.
Split up.
Alpha team,
take the west side,
Bravo team, take the east
side of the objective.
I got north-south. Move to
assault positions. Wait for my go.
ALPHA 1: Roger that.
So, do you have
a message for me?
General, if you
come in with me,
there are still people in
Washington who will work with you.
People who understand that
we still need the Iraqi army
to hold this place together.
Then why is your government
disbanding the Army?
Making us outlaws.
Why take Iraq apart
piece by piece?
Why?
I risked my life
to tell you the truth
about WMD.
"Tell the truth and you'll have a
place in the new Iraq," they said.
So where is my place,
Mr. Miller?
On a deck of cards?
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
Why are you
really here, Miller?
You were supposed
to lead me into a trap.
You will tell me now how
they are planning to take me.
Everybody in position?
Vanguard Bravo in position.
Vanguard 6, this is
Bravo 1. We're ready.
Vanguard 6, this is Alpha
1. We're in position.
You have to come
in with me, General.
You will get nothing
if you fight us.
You have to come in now
before it's too late.
You think the war is over
just because
you are in Baghdad?
You will see.
It has only just begun.
Let's go.
(METALLIC TINKLING)
Grenade!
Go! Go!
(EXPLOSIONS RUMBLING)
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
Come on! Move!
SOLDIER 1: Let's go. Let's go.
SOLDIER 2: Man down!
Hit the rooftop!
Go!
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
(MAN SPEAKING ARABIC)
Clear! Stack on Dutch!
Go!
"B" Team, go left. Last
guy with me. Let's go!
SOLDIER: I've got something.
Sir, I've got two hostiles
headed east.
Sir, I got one more. There's
one friendly in pursuit.
Hold!
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.
Two hostiles and one friendly
have exited target site
and are now moving through
alley northeast of your location.
BRIGGS:
Keep the area clear.
I'm activating
my transponder.
Bring me in.
I want to cut them off.
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
(WOMEN SCREAMING)
Down, get down!
Get the fuck down!
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.
The targets have lost the friendly.
Targets are now moving north.
Turn 45 degrees to your left,
maintain intercepting course.
Turn! Turn!
(ALL SHOUTING)
SOLDIER: I've lost
visual contact.
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
I've got them!
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.
Keep going
your current direction.
The target is crossing
open ground, headed north.
RPG!
Shit!
(MEN SHOUTING)
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
(GRUNTING)
Walk over.
Stop there.
You sure this is what they
want back in Washington?
Put that weapon down!
Now, Freddy!
What the fuck did you do?
It is not for you to
decide what happens here.
(MEN SHOUTING)
Get out of here,
Freddy. Go home.
We're gonna be
locking this area down.
There are gonna be
soldiers everywhere.
Go home now,
while you can.
(MAN SHOUTING ON MEGAPHONE)
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER: Do you think you can form a
successful government without Sunni involvement?
ZUBAIDl: This is
a new beginning for Iraq.
This is the end of tyranny
and the beginning of freedom.
How long will
US forces be in Iraq?
As long as they are needed.
Thank you. That's it.
Clark.
Mr. Zubaidi.
It's a great day.
Indeed, indeed.
Good to see you.
Welcome. Welcome.
(ALL MURMURING)
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
How are you, gentlemen?
How are you? Good, good.
REPORTER: So, does this mean
there's going to be an election soon?
(MAN MAKES PA ANNOUNCEMENTS)
There's been
a democracy deficit.
Can you comment about the
action last night in Adhamiya?
Chief Miller.
It's a copy of my intel report. I
wanted to give it to you personally.
Thank you.
Is this Al Rawi?
Yeah.
Yeah, I heard about this.
There's some pretty
strong language here.
But what's the point, Miller?
Do you think anybody's
going to listen to you?
I know what you did.
What did you say?
You made him up
to get what you needed.
Magellan.
You made him up.
I don't know what
you're talking about, Miller.
When you peddled that shit in
DC, did they know it was a lie?
Or did they just
never bother to ask?
Okay, okay.
Come on, none of this matters
anymore. WMD? This doesn't matter.
What the fuck are you talking
about? Of course, it fucking matters.
The reasons we go to war always matter!
It's all that fucking
matters. It fucking matters.
At ease, soldier.
Do you have any idea
what you've done here?
What's going to happen next
time we need people to trust us?
AIDE: Clark!
We're not turning
back, Miller.
We won.
AIDE: Clark!
Son of a bitch. What?
