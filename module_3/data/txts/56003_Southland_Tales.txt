Wonder if Matt sees that camera yet.....
Yep.
The camera, yeah.
Hey, man.
Oh. I didn't know it had water in it.
Go, go, go!
Go.

<i>World War llI had begun.</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>The accelerated conflict

Here at last!
<i>Boxer Santaros
had returned from the desert</i>
<i>with a case of amnesia.</i>
<i>Someone had gotten under his skin.</i>
<i>Her name was Krysta Kapowski,</i>
<i>and together
they had written a screenplay</i>
<i>that foretold
the tale of our destruction.</i>
<i>You almost wrecked my car.</i>
<i>Well?</i>
<i>Get in.</i>
Stigmata.
<i>We'll hear that fine new platter
by Nat King Cole...</i>
<i>"I'd Rather Have The Blues. "</i>
<i>The war machine
was running out of gas.</i>
<i>And there was no alternative.</i>
<i>Alternative fuel, that is.</i>
<i>Until one day,</i>
<i>when a renegade scientist
arrived in the Southland</i>
<i>with a cure for our sickness.</i>
<i>He built this great big machine
out in the ocean</i>
<i>that would generate a hydroelectric
energy field called Fluid Karma...</i>
<i>a wireless network of electric power
that would run machines by remote...</i>
<i>machines that would never
have to be refueled.</i>
<i>Treer Products is proud to present</i>
<i>the wizard Baron Von Westphalen
and his executive staff.</i>
<i>Have you built the world's first
perpetual motion machine?</i>
The ocean is
a perpetual motion machine.
Fluid Karma is a simulation
of the principles
you see working right here.
As long as the waves continue to crash,
Fluid Karma will exist.
<i>Quantum teleportation.</i>
<i>Explain the transport mechanism.
That's all I'm asking.</i>
<i>Fluid Karma works via the principle
of quantum entanglement.</i>
<i>Particles thus entangled
will behave identically...</i>
<i>Operation Q...</i>
<i>the atomic test program</i>
<i>of the Federal Civil Defense
Administration</i>

<i>I had to see Operation Q

<i>of the average American
man and woman.</i>
<i>I'm Krysta,</i>
<i>Krysta Now.</i>
<i>And we are here,
live in Malibu, with my guests today...</i>
<i>Shoshana Cox,
Sheena Gee, and Deena Storm.</i>
<i>Join us for an in-depth discussion</i>
<i>of the penetrating issues
facing society today...</i>
<i>issues like abortion, terrorism,
crime, poverty, social reform,</i>
<i>quantum teleportation,
teen horniness, and war.</i>
<i>Now we all made decisions
in our youth to start doing porn.</i>
<i>I think it's time that we
turn the mirror on ourselves.</i>
<i>And once you get on the bang bus,
you never get off.</i>
<i>You know what?
The bang bus should be banned.</i>
<i>It's totally unethical,
even within the parameters of porn.</i>
<i>Do you like to get slapped
to the ground and fucked?</i>
<i>Too violent.
Violence and porn should not mix.</i>
<i>It gives porn a bad name.</i>
<i>You know what?
I like to get fucked.</i>
<i>I like to get fucked hard.</i>
<i>- Yeah. Me, too.
- Amen to that.</i>
<i>I mean, violence is a big problem
in our society today,</i>
<i>and I will not support it.</i>
<i>That's the primary reason
why I won't do anal.</i>
<i>I didn't know that about you.</i>
<i>Makes me want to give up anal.</i>
Anyone who knows
anything of history
knows that great social changes
are impossible
without feminine upheaval.
<i>Our first issue today is terrorism.</i>
Go ahead and make fun of
my prophecies all you want, Fortunio.
But deep down inside,
everyone wishes
they were a porn star.
Really?
We're a bisexual nation
living in denial,
all because of a bunch of nerds,
a bunch of nerds who got off a boat
in the 15th century
and decided that sex
was something to be ashamed of.
All the Pilgrims did was ruin
the American Indian orgy of freedom.
You been lying to me?
You have to trust me.
I'm here to protect you.
From who?
From the people out there
who want to destroy you.
<i>Later that day,</i>
<i>Krysta had a lunch meeting
with adult film director Cyndi Pinziki.</i>
Well, in my first six movies
I was just "Krysta. "
You know, but then in order
to differentiate myself
from the 76 other Krystas
in the business,
I added the "Now. "
Wow.
Well, it's all about now, 2008,
not next week, not tomorrow.
If you want to fuck me,
you can fuck me... now.
Wow.
<i>So is that the name
of your TV show? Now?</i>
It's a topical-discussion-
chat-reality show.
Got the pop album, the jewelry,
clothing and perfume line,
the energy drink.
This is a very ambitious
business plan.
Can you keep a secret?
Of course.
I'm fucking a very large
and important man.
Wow.
<i>The search for Boxer Santaros</i>
<i>reached up into the highest levels
of national security...</i>
<i>led by none other
than his mother-in-law...</i>
<i>Nana Mae Frost...</i>
<i>wife of Republican senator
Bobby Frost,</i>
<i>former prom queen
and Deputy Director of the NSA.</i>
Nana Mae Frost,
please acknowledge.
<i>Identification confirmed.
Welcome aboard, Miss Frost.</i>
Thank you.
<i>Nana makes me wear
these fucking things.</i>
<i>Do I look like a nerd?</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>- Welcome to Treer Plaza, tower one.
- Yes.</i>
<i>We know that Boxer crossed
the border into California.</i>
<i>There hasn't been a single fingerprint
found in the system since then.</i>
We know someone
must be hiding him.
What the hell was he doing
in Nevada?
We think he was kidnapped
at a charity scavenger hunt.
Somebody stole
one of the prototype SUVs
from a warehouse in San Pedro.
Tracking devices tell us
that they crossed the border
way out past Lake Mead.
Get over to the computer.
I can show you.
<i>- All right.
- He's been brainwashed.</i>
<i>I'm sending you
the surveillance footage right now.</i>
This footage
was taken by his abductor,
someone with ties
to the Neo-Marxist movement.
Is that Boxer?
Yes.
Is this the last time anybody saw him?
Yes, except for these.
What's that, smoke?
Somehow
the vehicle caught on fire.
There was somebody in there, too.
What?
Baron has retrieved
the charred remains of the body.
- Have they identified the body yet?
- Not that I know of.
<i>Grid nine zero two

<i>Venice Beach was home
to the Neo-Marxist underground.</i>
<i>They were the disciples
of German philosopher Karl Marx.</i>
Here we go, just in time.
This is Fortunio Balducci,
his new best friend.
Drug dealer, pimp,
co-producer
on some new mystery project.
He's been crashing with Fortunio
in Manhattan Beach all week.
They hooked up
on some drug binge out in Vegas.
Our little Krysta
has promised me a marriage killer,
maybe even an election killer.
Boxer hasn't talked
to his wife in a week.
She's on the campaign trail.
Nobody knows where he's been,
much to the senator's dismay,
and his bitch wife, Nana Mae.
People in Washington
are already whispering.
Looks like the nervous breakdown
of the century.
Too bad it's an election year.
Nothing that an eight ball, a porn star,
and tattoo parlor can't handle.
<i>Revelation 6:8...</i>
<i>"And behold, a pale horse,</i>

You know, there'd be
a lot less violence in the world
if everyone just got
a little more cardio.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, is that a bazooka?
That is a heat-seeking ground-to-air
rocket launcher from Syria.
You can't afford that.
What exactly do you want?
I need some
9 millimeter blanks.
What else do you need
along with the blanks?
That's all, just the blanks.
Here is your UPU 9
and the blanks.
What the fuck is this?
What, you won't take
a personal check?
No, I won't take a fucking check.
Get the fuck out of my ice cream truck,
you Cro-Magnon bitch.
Say it again, man.
Say it again.
Huh? What was that?
Huh?
What was that?
I can't hear you.
I can't hear you.
What was that?
Say it again, you fuck!
There.
Cock fucker.

<i>You're just reading a bunch of stuff

<i>You're not listening.</i>
<i>- I always think that...
- You're not listening.</i>
<i>- ... writes about science.

Ronald, they're just blanks,
sweetheart.
<i>...terribly difficult.</i>
<i>We deduce

<i>...are reversible.</i>
There's a delay in my reflection.
<i>...which implies that if you start

What did you tell him?
That he hit his head in the desert,
and he has amnesia.
<i>The Baron claims
that Fluid Karma is safe,</i>
<i>but he refuses to release
the environmental...</i>
Well, these things...
these things better look real.
Ronald?
Bing said they're going to look real.
When Ronald fires,
he's going to hit the squibs.
You just drugged and kidnapped
an UPU 2 officer.
Okay, that's against the law,
sweetheart.
Now, I need you to come out here
and do this thing.
You need to become a racist cop.
Come on, honey.
Let's dry our tears and face our fears.
<i>If you succeed in building one,
you are guaranteed</i>
<i>not to be able to explain it
using the known laws of physics.</i>
Promise me you won't get hurt.
We promise.
<i>The Neo-Marxists
had taken a hostage...</i>
<i>a hostage they would use</i>
<i>to expose the sins
committed by USIDent.</i>
<i>His mission was
to impersonate his twin brother.</i>
<i>But his heart
was filled with despair.</i>
Officer Roland Taverner.
Of course you are.
How you doing, man?
When did you get back
from the desert?
Don't exactly remember.
Oh, that's okay.
That's okay, you're okay.
Come on, let's go upstairs,
right over here.
This is an epic
Los Angeles crime saga.
And you're researching your role.
You play a cop.
You want to do a ride-along?
Yes, exactly.
But I'm also directing the film.
It takes place in the near future.
Right.
Scientists are saying
the future's going to be
far more futuristic
than they originally predicted.
The basic concept is this...
I play an LAPD cop
who isn't who he seems.
He's a paranoid schizophrenic
who has a supernatural gift.
He sees things.
And he senses a change
in the city.
Crime suddenly skyrockets
for no apparent reason.
The world is coming to an end.
And he's the only one
who can see the truth.
What's the truth?
My character,
he realizes that
the apocalyptic crime rate
is because of global deceleration.
The rotation of the Earth
is slowing down
at a rate of point zero,
zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero,
zero...
six miles per hour each day,
disrupting the chemical equilibrium
in the human brain,
causing very irrational
criminal behavior.
How does he stop
the global deceleration?
Oh, he can't stop it.
There is no stopping
what can't be stopped.
Only God...
can stop it.
<i>But The New York Times
said "God is dead. "</i>
So in the end, I die
in a very tragic downtown shootout
while whispering my theory
to Dr. Muriel Fox,
the oceanography disaster specialist.
Astrophysicist!
The oceanography
disaster specialist...
sweetheart.
My character... his name...
is Jericho Kane.
You're going to have
to wear a bulletproof vest.
Let me ask you,
what goes through your head
when you sit behind the wheel...
cruising the streets,
digesting humanity?
Is it a process of elimination?
<i>Each car that passes,
the person inside...</i>
<i>are they a mere suspect?</i>
<i>Or are we all innocents,</i>
<i>our chariots mere chess pieces</i>
waiting to be thrown from the gridlock
and into the arms of the wolves?
Well, I'd say
we act like concerned citizens.
We look at all the people,
all the cars.
We look for any unusual
or erratic behavior.
Speed changes or lane changes
that seem unsafe.
Yeah, but don't you think
emotions come into play?
Judgment calls,
affected by whatever mood you're in
on that particular day?
Emotional responses
based on your past events?
Well, there is one thing.
I knew it.
I knew it, tell me. Be honest.
To be honest...
we're just looking out
for the niggers.
- The niggers?
- Yeah.
They're everywhere.
- You're joking.
- No, I'm not joking.
I'm just fucking with you, man.
That's a funny joke.
Yes! He said "nigger. "
But I don't think he said it
with authority.
I didn't believe him as a racist cop.
Fascist, maybe, but not racist.
<i>Ask him about his wife.</i>
So what does your wife think
about your new girlfriend?
- My wife?
- Yeah.
She cool with the fact that you have
a porn-star girlfriend on the side?
I'm not married.
- You're not?
- No, I'm not.
I could've sworn you were married
to the daughter of a Texas senator,
Senator Bobby Frost.
Yeah, well, I'm not.
I don't know what you're talking about,
and I don't know who he is.
I don't want to talk about this.
Why are you asking questions?
I want to talk about my movie.
Okay. Let's talk about your film.
What's it really about?
It all hinges
on a top secret experiment.
Young couple comes
home from the hospital
with their newborn baby.
A week goes by, and the baby still
hasn't produced a bowel movement.
Maybe the baby's just constipated.
No, no, no, no.
This is a very special baby.
This baby processes
energy differently.
I haven't had a bowel movement
in six days.
I haven't taken a piss either.
<i>Revelation 11</i>
<i>tells the tale of two witnesses
who appear in Jerusalem</i>
<i>to speak out
against the sins of mankind.</i>
<i>They are eventually killed</i>
<i>by those tormented
by their prophesies.</i>
The dude hasn't taken a shit
in a week.
When has it ever been in the Bible
that you have to have
a bowel movement?
It's not written anywhere.
It's not written in the Bible,
but some things is written,
like, in Mother Nature.
All of the animals shit.
Cows shit, Ilamas shit.
Do they like it?
Do they want to?
If they had a voice,
would they rather not?
I think they feel better
after they take a shit.
I think they do like it.
My answer's yes.
My answer is no.
We're never going to agree on this.
We've got to stop arguing.
We have a lot of footage
we've got to shoot.
We've got to get out of here.
Where is Kenny?
Oh, look who decided to show up.
Dude, you are late.
You two don't understand.
I mean, the shit is
literally hitting the fan.
Whatever, dude.
Are we still routing out of USIDent?
Yeah, of course.
We never stopped.
Ken, he wakes up,
give him an injection right there.
<i>- Dude, you are late.
- You two don't understand.</i>
<i>I mean, the shit is
literally hitting the fan.</i>
<i>The Neo-Marxists
had recruited young Kenny Chan</i>
<i>to work as a mole inside of USIDent.</i>
Hey, Starla?
Can I get my coat back?
Appreciate it.
<i>But it had been his great misfortune
to trust his colleague...</i>
<i>Starla Von Luft.</i>
<i>Senator Bobby Frost
arrived in the Southland</i>
<i>as the campaign
for the White House</i>
<i>finds itself in a race
to secure California.</i>
<i>Senator Frost plans to tour
the alternative fuel project</i>
<i>at Santa Monica Pier,</i>
<i>hoping to combat
the intense criticism</i>
<i>from environmental groups</i>
<i>that he does not support
the alternative fuel movement.</i>
<i>USIDent has unraveled
a conspiracy</i>
<i>involving the trafficking
of human fingers.</i>
<i>Neo-Marxist cells</i>
<i>are attempting to rig
the upcoming election</i>
<i>using rogue fingerprints
from severed thumbs.</i>
Well, Christ Almighty.
Lookie here.
"Teen horniness is not a crime. "
I never said it was.
Sir, I'm afraid it gets even worse.
Well, how the hell can it get
any worse?
We just received this image of Boxer
from an unidentified source
calling themselves "Deep Throat Two. "
They're transmitting
from a scrambler.
We can't trace it.
Oh, my God.
Well, how about that?
Talk of the devil,
we've got an incoming call
from Deep Throat Two.
Who are you,
and what do you want?
<i>This is Deep Throat Two.
The bitch is back.</i>
And she's got Boxer Santaros
on tape in compromising positions.
And how much
do you want for the tape?
One million dollars cash
<i>and a yes vote endorsement
by the senator on Proposition 69.</i>
Miss Deep Throat,
this is Senator Bobby Frost.
I just saw your little movie.
I think it stinks.
<i>Furthermore, we do not
negotiate with terrorists.</i>
And if you think you're going
to get any money out of us,
you've got miles to go
before you sleep
and miles to go before you sleep.
Bitch.
All right, no need to panic.
We've always got phase two.
Wait, what is phase two?
You didn't tell me
there was a phase two.
Krysta, no offense to you
and your little career-makeover plan,
but we are trying to impact
the outcome of an election.
<i>Proposition 69.</i>
<i>To Krysta, that number
had one meaning</i>
<i>and one meaning only.</i>
<i>To everyone else,</i>
<i>it was a proposition on the ballot
to restrict the powers</i>
<i>of the oppressive institution
known as USIDent.</i>
<i>My parents died
in the 4th of July attacks.</i>
<i>When will we be free of this terror?</i>
<i>Vote no. No!</i>
<i>I think the press conference
is over. Thank you.</i>
<i>Always the nerds.</i>
<i>And the Supreme Court
are a bunch of assholes that...</i>
<i>who the fuck elected them
anyway, right?</i>
<i>I mean, they're a bunch
of supreme shit heads, right?</i>
<i>Don't tell me what to do
with my body, you fuckstick, right?</i>
<i>I have a question
for the Supreme Court.</i>
<i>What happens when
a woman has sex on a flight</i>
<i>from London to Los Angeles,</i>
<i>then takes the morning-after pill
while flying across the time zone?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Then it becomes
the morning-before pill.</i>
<i>You are a genius.</i>
<i>- Holy shit. That is brilliant.
- Hello. Can't argue with that.</i>
<i>Urban pacification units
arrested a group of individuals</i>
<i>tied to the Neo-Marxist movement,</i>
<i>fighting to impose restrictions
on the think tank organization</i>
<i>through Proposition 69.</i>
<i>ACLU representatives
joined the protest downtown,</i>
<i>where there were more arrests.</i>
...and I know what I want.
- We need to stay in the moment...
<i>Phase two was now in motion.</i>
<i>Dion and Dream were going
to stage their own demise...</i>
<i>a desperate attempt
to destroy USIDent.</i>
Hit me again, baby.
You know, I still don't see
why facial prosthetics are necessary.
That wasn't part of the plan.
I told you a million times, genius,
Dion and I are cultural icons.
We cannot afford to get recognized
by the camera.
Oh, that's right.
See, I didn't realize
that your spoken-word poetry
had captured the cultural zeitgeist
of the nation, Dream.
Yeah, well, at least I'm not
a second-rate comedian, Zora.
Just because it's loud
doesn't mean it's funny.
You know, you might want
to watch what you say, bitch.
Sometimes a dream can become
a nightmare on the turn of a dime.
Will you two just chill the fuck out?
Go get those squib detonators ready,
They're going to be here
in, like, an hour.
Hey, Bing, these off-road rollerblades
were a great idea.
Thanks, Zora.

<i>- Yes.

No, no.

I'm at work.
Yeah, well...
Yeah, you know,

<i>So what the hell is it
you want me to do?</i>
Fire at will.
Wake up. Wake up.
You have to wake up now!
Where is he?
I don't know.
Take him down.
He doesn't know who he is.
Promise me you'll find him.
- I promise.
- Okay, good.
There's a window right up there.
You got to go.
I've had this recurring dream.
Tell me about it.
I wake up in this dungeon.
The walls are made of sand.
As I slowly make my way
through this maze,
approaching
a light source at the end...
guess who's standing there
waiting for me?
Who?
You.
Do you ever feel like there's
a thousand people...
locked inside of you?
Sometimes.
But it's your memory
that keeps them glued together.
Keeps all those people from...
fighting one another.
Maybe in the end that's all we have.
The memory gospel.
Would you excuse me for a second?
Yes.

How did you get a copy

Don't look so scared,

Oh, you bitch!

I'll fuck him in front of you, too!
You a fucking slut!

Bitch, I'll fucking kill you.
You kill me, I'll get the fucking cops

How? How? How?
You're going to be dead!

Good evening, officer.

I think I can handle this.
No.
I think you could use a little backup.
No, you fucking bitch.
Fuck you!
Don't call me a fucking bitch!

These Hollywood managers,

Let me tell you something, Teri.
When the shit hits the fan,
it all smells the same.
Fuck, yeah, it does.
I don't know
what it is you've done...
but you have to promise me
that he won't get hurt.
He's not the person you think he is.
Mr. Santaros.
Nice. Yeah.
You got the... the head
of the Neo-Marxist underground
and his bitch girlfriend,

Dion and Dream are dead.
They're not.
They were just squibs.
Those weren't squibs.
Yes, they were.
We doubled up on the squibs,
Roland, two each.
I thought my name was Ronald.
That's what I said, I said Ronald.
What's wrong with you?
I think you've been
lying to me, Zora.
Yeah.
I think you've been
lying to me all along.
Okay, now you're just being
paranoid, Ronald.
Listen, guys.
I think I'm going

Okay, Bing.
Go ahead.
Good luck.

I mean, is there...

Yeah.
There is.

Okay, okay, so... so we have to give

She wants a million dollars

I'm not in that movie.
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
we have to give her

It's an election year, Bob.
Everyone pays.
They're right, Bob, we should pay.
Deep Throat Two can be silenced.
You just take it

Pregnant? She's pregnant?
Yeah, you're gonna be

Miss Krysta, did somebody
put you up to this?
Yeah. He did.
He paid me to bring Boxer back

- Baron, Baron.
- No, no.
Is this true?
Preposterous.
- Listen to me, would you stop it?
- I'll cut you down, you little shit.
Hey, we're on the same team here.
Baron would not sabotage
the campaign.
Who are you going to trust, Bob,
a Nobel prize-winning scientist
or a two-bit porn star?
I don't know, Dad.
I wouldn't trust him,
because you know
he's been secretly funding
the Neo-Marxist movement.
What? How dare you.
Those clowns know less
about Karl Marx than that Chihuahua.
No, you have been secretly sabotaging
this campaign from the inside out.
You should be very careful
about pointing fingers, Madeline,
because I happen to know
that you are pregnant
with Brandt's baby,
and I have the blood tests
to prove it.

<i>The Baron had been

<i>injected into the neck.</i>
<i>Only a few of us

<i>The Baron claims

<i>Why are we being kept in the dark?
What is he hiding?</i>
<i>A deal for the Japanese license

<i>said to be moments from closing.</i>
<i>The Baron's quest
for global domination</i>
<i>was almost complete.</i>
<i>Negotiations had concluded
with Hideo Takehashi,</i>
<i>the prime minister of Japan.</i>
<i>Takehashi was willing
to relinquish one of his fingers</i>
<i>in exchange for access
to Fluid Karma.</i>
You bastard!
You said finger, not entire hand.
Clearly your attorneys
didn't read the whole contract.
It stipulates
a six-inch margin of error

Oh, it's the Neo-Marxists. They've

Yes, that's the only copy.
Oh, please, I'd like
to ask you a few questions.
Go ahead, ask away.
How do you sleep at night?
Very well, thank you very much.
That is, until I hear
screams from next door
because USIDent
is raiding my neighbor's house,
based on false information
provided by that Orwellian nightmare
your friend endorsed.
You ever lose someone close to you,
a loved one, in a terrorist attack?
'Cause I have.
This may come as a shock to you,
Mr. Smallhouse,
but I lost two people in Abilene...
two of my four ex-husbands,
on a fishing trip,
which they took every year
to bitch about me.
What are you going to do
with all that free money?
I'm going to distribute
my documentary film,
help some women in the Middle East
get some more civil liberties.
Do you know

"Civil liberties"?
You ought to write them down.
You know what? You're going

That's right,
I know your real name.
You know,
I wasn't going to do this,
but I feel very generous today.
I'm going to leave you
with a little present.
Wow. I am flattered.
What is it?
- A Taser gun to the balls.
- What?
You should know that
there's another tape out there,
a far more incriminating tape
featuring your pal,
Boxer Santaros,
and a double murder,

a lot more than a million
to get your hands on that one,
because when
all is said and done,
nobody rocks the cock

Whoa, yeah!

Yes.
You must board the MegaZeppelin.

What is the secret?
There's a dead body

It all ends tonight.
It's gonna be a hot time
in the city tonight.
Job well done, Miss Now.
Is he gonna be okay?
Well, as they say,
only time will tell.
What does this mean?
There is a path to end all suffering.
You should take it.

Did you retrieve the DVD
from Deep Throat Two?
<i>Affirmative, Cyndi.
I'm going to be going live</i>
with three tales
from the Southland this evening.
How long will the website be active
before USIDent
can route in and shut it down?
<i>Are you kidding me?
Who are you talking to?</i>
Don't worry your
pretty little head over it.
You go enjoy the rest
of the party. I'm out.
<i>To be honest...</i>
<i>we're just looking out
for the niggers.</i>
<i>This is my deal now...</i>
<i>Santaros.</i>
<i>More than a hundred thousand
people have gathered</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

<i>Farewell, one and only beloved.</i>
<i>I cannot write anymore,</i>
<i>or my head will be
all in a whirl, and...</i>
<i>Adieu, adieu my sweetheart.</i>
<i>Jenny.</i>
<i>You try so hard to be heard</i>
<i>You try so hard to not hurt</i>
<i>I give you nothing to doubt,
and you doubt me</i>
<i>I'll give you all that I have,

<i>Now I know
that my eyes must close here</i>
<i>Every word seems to feel
like you don't care</i>
<i>But I know that
you're so confused and afraid</i>
<i>I just want to be one true thing
that don't fade</i>
<i>I don't want to give up tomorrow</i>
<i>I just can't understand
why we're going on</i>
Thank you.

Mr. Boxer Santaros
has arrived.
Excellent.
How does it end?
A handshake.
I had a dream last night
that you died.
Mr. Santaros.
Your presence
is requested in the Marx Suite.
Alone.
I'm not going to die.
<i>...he was on fire.</i>
<i>The surrounding stores,</i>
<i>you could see people running
in and out of the broken windows.</i>
<i>What is going on...</i>
<i>And there's another...
another explosion just took off</i>
<i>down... right down there
off of Third Street.</i>
<i>Revelation 22...</i>
<i>"Very soon now
shall I be with you again...</i>
<i>"bringing the reward
to be given to every man</i>
<i>according to what he deserves. "</i>
Mr. Santaros,
welcome to the Marx Suite.
Now, Simon says
lower your sidearm, please.
Are you just deaf
or willfully stupid?
I told you to lower
that fucking sidearm!
And there you go.
Well, come on in.
<i>They're trying to rig the election.</i>
California is too close to call.
All... all right, sweetheart,
whatever you say.
Why isn't she here?
She won't leave her post.
It is time for a surgical strike.
I can smell you
from down the hall.
No. Not now, Dennis.
The Neo-Marxists
have infiltrated USIDent.
She has to leave there immediately.
It's okay. She has
everything under control.
We need to get her out of there.
<i>There are thousands, probably
tens of thousands of protesters</i>
<i>all up and down the street</i>
<i>and spreading out
into the surrounding arteries</i>
<i>coming in
toward the downtown area.</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Treer MegaZeppelin.</i>
The project was called
Serpentine Dream Theory.
The Tidal Generator
within Utopia Three
has achieved
simulated perpetual motion.
The impact of this achievement
has slowed the acceleration
of the planet to such a degree
that certain environmental anomalies
have started to surface.
One of these anomalies,
discovered earlier this year,
was a rift in the fourth dimension.
A rift in the fabric of space-time...
half a kilometer wide.
Located on the outskirts
of Lake Mead.
Yes, Mr. Santaros.
Just like you imagined
in your screenplay.
And what did we do
once we discovered a rift
in the fourth dimension?
We launched monkeys into it.
Only a human subject
could survive that jaunt.
The soul of a monkey
can't survive
the dimensional threshold.
So we learned,
at which point the Baron decided
that the first human subject
to travel through the rift
would be a movie star.
Why me?
Your celebrity
and your political ties
proved an irresistible combination.
As the satellite photos show,
at approximately 10:51 a. M...
and this is 69 minutes
before you passed through the rift...
a duplicate Boxer Santaros
appeared.
You traveled 69 minutes
back in time, sir,
at which point your future self...
and your past self
confronted one another.
So I'm my future self.
And I'm the dude
who traveled through the rift.
And this is all that's left
of your past self.
This body, this artifact,
this dual existence
of a single human soul
could unlock the secret of creation,
the secret of humankind.
I don't understand.
I've never considered
committing suicide.
I'm a pimp.
And pimps don't commit suicide.
We don't know what would happen
if two identical human souls
and the vessels that they travel in
were to come into immediate
close contact with one another.
<i>Indy 103.1... the independent FM.
Fourth of July weekend...</i>
Where did you get this?
Pilot Abilene.
Pilot Abilene?
Do you bleed?
<i>You can fly so bloody</i>
<i>What happened
in Fallujah was an accident.</i>
<i>They called it friendly fire,</i>
<i>and Private Taverner
could not forgive himself</i>
<i>for what he had done to me.</i>
Yo, dog, where are we headed?
Somewhere downtown.
We have to go downtown.
He's in an ice cream truck.
Wow, I can feel it.
<i>There is automatic weapon fire,
we understand,</i>
<i>down on the ground,
and we just heard...</i>
<i>...the power and the kingdom
of your God...</i>
Yo, dog, I'm going
to empty out my account...
take everything I got.
Neat.
<i>Welcome
to the Rove Credit Union.</i>
<i>Please have
your USIDent card ready</i>
<i>in order to make your transaction.</i>
<i>...is the promise
in the Word of God!</i>
<i>Welcome,
Martin Kefauver, welcome.</i>
<i>Martin Kefauver,
welcome, welcome, welcome...</i>
<i>Kefauver and card ready...</i>
Yo, dog, it says... it says
"transaction denied," dog.
Yo, what... what do I do?
We're going to take
the ATM machine with us to Mexico.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise for the national anthem.</i>
<i>I give you Rebekah Del Rio.</i>
<i>...whose broad stripes
and bright stars</i>
<i>Through the perilous fight</i>
<i>O'er the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming</i>
<i>And the rockets'red glare</i>
<i>The bombs bursting in air</i>
<i>Gave proof through the night</i>
<i>That our flag was still there</i>
<i>Oh, say, does that
star-spangled banner</i>
<i>Yet wave?</i>
<i>O'er the land of the free</i>
<i>And the home of the brave</i>
<i>We've got a perimeter breach
at Caltrans Building.</i>
<i>I repeat,
we've got a perimeter breach.</i>
Die, you fucking pig!
<i>Uh-oh, wait.</i>
<i>Apparently we've lost
contact with Sky Cam.</i>
<i>As you could see
just before we lost the picture,</i>
<i>a lot of people downtown,
a lot of activity,</i>
<i>all kinds of problems.</i>
<i>- Please stay indoors.
- Stay inside.</i>
<i>And, you know, we're getting
information that the Neo-Marxist...</i>
You know.
You know exactly what happened
out in the desert.
Who did the Baron hire
to kidnap me?
And who drove me
through the time rift?
You haven't figured that out yet?
What is his name?
Officer Roland Taverner.
Officer Roland Taverner.
How are you?
Ice cream truck.
Teri?
Teri, you've gone too far.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we seem to be having...</i>
Is he still alive?
In more ways than one.
You made sure Taverner
went through the time rift with me.
Then you hit the SUV
self-destruct trigger, by remote,
which means...
I didn't kill myself.
You're a pimp.
Pimps don't commit suicide.
Oh, you got that right.
And Roland Taverner...
and his twin brother...
they're the same person,
aren't they?
Two identical souls
walking the face of the earth,
coexisting in the same
dominion of chaos.
What will happen
if they shake hands?
The fourth dimension
will collapse upon itself.
You stupid bitch.
<i>Again, don't be alarmed,
but stay inside.</i>
The ocean is in control.
<i>...the rioting continues downtown,
and it's a problem right now</i>
<i>because it looks like
the crowds are growing.</i>
<i>Even though we no longer
have contact with our chopper,</i>
<i>we do understand it was
the Neo-Marxist movement</i>
<i>that started these riots.</i>
<i>They're continuing to move
throughout downtown Los Angeles...</i>
And this is the tower of fire.
We have to evacuate.
What in God's name
are you talking about?
There he is. Let's go.
<i>We've got automatic weapons fire
at Fourth Street and Hill.</i>
<i>I think they're already inside.</i>
<i>Recommend open fire
into the crowd.</i>
No.
Run!
Yo, yo, dog, you all right?
Well done, soldier.
Take that target.
You can't miss.
Come on, let's go, let's go!
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Krysta Now,</i>
<i>Shoshanna Cox,
Sheena Gee, and Deena Score.</i>
<i>They are
the Memory Gospel Dancers.</i>
Let's... let's leave right now.
This guy right here
might never leave.
It had to be this way.
I know.
He's going to die.
There's nothing
we can do about it?
Is it some kind of an orgy
or something?
What the hell's he doing?
Evacuate the atrium.
Move to the rear of the MegaZeppelin.
No.
Everybody, go back to your seats.
Or I kill myself,
and I swear to God...
I'll do it.
We have to let go.
I can't.
You have to let me go.
But the truck will fall,
and we'll both die.
Let me go,
or I'll pull this fucking trigger!
- No, you won't.
- I swear to God I'll do it!
No, you won't.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the party is over.</i>
<i>Have a nice apocalypse.</i>
Put down the gun.
This is all in my head.
I can pull the trigger now
and wake up.
This whole nightmare
will be over.
Our mission
is to destroy capitalism.
Dethrone God.
Officer Roland Taverner.
That's who you want.
Don't you remember, Ronald?
Do you remember Fallujah?
I remember everything.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the way the world ends.</i>
<i>Not with a whimper,
but with a bang.</i>
<i>But there is hope.</i>
<i>In the end we can be reassured
by one undeniable truth.</i>
<i>Nobody rocks the cock
like Krysta Now.</i>
<i>And I mean nobody.</i>
I knew that son of a bitch was crazy.
Get me out of here.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't our fault.
Friendly fire.
I forgive you.
Friendly fire.
- I forgive you.
- Friendly fire.
- Friendly fire.
- I forgive you.
- Friendly fire.
- I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
