<i>On September the 5th, 1977,</i>
<i>NASA launched the spacecraft</i> Voyager.
<i>Destination unknown.</i>
<i>Its only cargo a set of records curated
by American astronomer Carl Sagan.</i>
<i>The collection was designed
to last a billion years</i>
<i>and potentially give extraterrestrial
life a glimpse at humankind.</i>
<i>The records were printed in gold-plated
copper to prevent corrosion,</i>
<i>and included international music,</i>
<i>greetings in 59 languages,</i>
<i>the crashing of an ocean wave,</i>
<i>wind through an oak tree,</i>
<i>whale calls, the human heartbeat,</i>
<i>and the sound of a kiss.</i>
<i>At around 12:15 p.m.,
Central Standard Time,</i>
<i>just as</i> Voyager <i>approached
the edge of our solar system,</i>
<i>back on Earth,
in an unremarkable suburb,</i>
<i>Don Truby was attempting
to log onto BangBus.com,</i>
<i>a pornographic website
featuring young actresses</i>
<i>in the roles of helpless hitchhikers.</i>
<i>However, the accumulation of malware
had rendered his computer useless.</i>
<i>Don gave a brief thought to masturbating
using only his imagination,</i>
<i>but the sheer quality and variety
of the Internet had left his brain</i>
<i>an inferior substitute.</i>
<i>In order to access the limitless
fountain of pornography</i>
<i>that he had become accustomed to,</i>
<i>Don would have to use the only
remaining computer in the house.</i>
<i>The one belonging to
his 15-year-old son.</i>
Y-O-U...
P-O-R-N.
<i>Don had purchased the computer
for his son's birthday.</i>
<i>It was meant for homework.</i>
Jesus.
<i>He couldn't help think
back to his own childhood</i>
<i>when he discovered his father's
secret stash of magazines</i>
<i>while searching for a
bicycle wrench in the garage.</i>
<i>He felt a sadness about not being
a part of that moment for his son.</i>
<i>A moment he considered to be
an intrinsic part of growing up.</i>
<i>Almost a passing of the torch.</i>
<i>Good afternoon, teachers and students...
just a reminder to all students...</i>
<i>Like many Texas high schools, the pride
of East Vista was their football program.</i>
<i>The key to their junior
varsity team winning district</i>
<i>was sophomore running back Tim Mooney,</i>
<i>a one-man scoring machine that had
carried them to victory as a freshman.</i>
Hey.
Of all the posters in this school,
you had to deface mine.
- I thought it was an improvement.
- You think this is funny?
"DTF?" I know what DTF means.
Tim? Come on back.
I just thought about it a lot and...
sports just sort of seem
a little... pointless.
Sports are not pointless, Tim.
These are the best years of your life!
You don't just throw God's
gifts away like that.
Well... But that's why you
need football right now.
We need you on the team.
Have you told your father?
- Yeah, yeah, he knows.
- Look. We know you're having a tough year.
I'm sure everything with your parents...
I'm sure your mom left a mighty
big hole in your life at home.
How about I have a word
with your teachers
about easing up on your homework?
How's that sound?
You are seriously skinny this year.
Thanks. I went on this super
diet over the summer.
In my opinion it worked.
I mean, you look really great.
I tried not eating one summer,
but my boobs dropped a size, so I quit.
Can't be having that.
- You and Danny are so cute together.
- Thanks! Right?
Have you guys hooked up yet?
Yeah! Yeah. I mean, like, a little.
You know I'm not, like, a total slut.
It's a new era for women, okay?
Just because
I'm comfortable with my body and enjoy
hooking up doesn't make me a slut.
Who do you hook up with anyway?
Just this older guy I met when
my mom and I were in Florida.
Yeah, okay. Check it out.
Oh, my God.
- Was it gross?
- No.
It wasn't that bad.
It was kind of salty, I guess.
Did you let him, like,
you know, finish in your mouth?
Allison!
Yeah. How else would
I know it was salty?
Why would you even
have him take a photo?
I need to know what my
audience is seeing.
Anyways, I'm just saying, it's...
It's like a... it's like
a natural progression.
And if you don't sleep
with somebody soon
you're gonna be completely
retarded in bed
when you're a junior and it counts.
My mom's here! See ya, bitches!
Hi, baby!
New outfit?
Another request came in today,
so I stopped at Hot Topic.
It's cute, right?
Okay, you've read through
every solitary interaction
I've had on every single website, Mom.
I think I'm safe from "the predators."
Oh, really? What is this?
"U R hawt." Who is Derrick G.?
- A friend of a friend?
- He's an adult.
So? I can't help if some random
guy finds my picture cute. Jeez.
I can.
Are you serious?
Well, now we don't have to worry
about him being inappropriate.
Yeah, I'd really hate to get
any more compliments, Mom.
It could really do a lot
of permanent damage.
Honey, you know I just
do this to keep you safe.
Whatever.
I love you, sweetie.
- I love you, too.
- Okay, let me see your phone.
<i>During these weekly spot-checks,</i>
<i>Brandy would divulge every username
and password she employed online.</i>
<i>As an additional precaution,</i>
<i>Patricia installed a device that
monitored all incoming messages</i>
<i>and recorded every keystroke
her daughter ever made.</i>
- We got six new subscribers today.
- That's awesome!
<i>The website had been the
idea of a local talent agent.</i>
<i>Each time she received an
email or a new subscriber,</i>
<i>Hannah felt a little bit
more like a celebrity.</i>
- You sure you're comfortable?
- Yeah.
Okay. Here we go!
Hey, Dad.
Tim Mooney quit.
No kidding?
Brutal.
What kind of mother abandons her family
for California?
I've got, like, a pretty hard test
tomorrow so I'm gonna go study.
Yeah, "studying."
What are you talking about?
You know, you're gross. He's 15.
- That's all I did when I was 15.
- Yeah, that I believe.
So, how you feeling?
About what?
Oh, stop, he's right there.
- He can't hear us.
- What, right now?
- It's been almost two months.
- No, it hasn't!
Last time was after that
barbecue at your sister's.
Okay, fine. We'll do it tomorrow.
But it's gotta be quick.
Don't worry, it will be.
<i>Chris Truby began surfing
pornography at the age of 10</i>
<i>with a simple search
of the word "boobs."</i>
<i>This somewhat innocent query
led to a series of clicks,</i>
<i>and within an hour of his first search,</i>
<i>Chris was watching a short video
entitled "Titty Fucking Cum Queen."</i>
<i>He might have thought
this video to be unusual</i>
<i>had it not already been viewed
by three million others.</i>
<i>By age 15, Chris found it
difficult to achieve an erection</i>
<i>without viewing a level of deviance
that fell, well, outside societal norms.</i>
<i>Hey, baby. You're going to
listen to everything I say</i>
<i>and follow all of my instructions.
Understand?</i>
<i>Now, grab that cock.</i>
<i>Don't squeeze too tight. Not yet.</i>
There she is! Practice run late?
- Shepherd's pie.
- Yup, we got your favorite.
I'm gonna do my homework.
I'll grab something later.
I'll make her up a plate.
Here you go, sweetie.
- Thank you.
- Dig in.
Let me know if you want seconds.
So did you clean up her Internet?
Yes, honey, I cleaned up her Internet.
<i>Since quitting football, Tim had
invested over a thousand hours</i>
<i>with his guild-mates
on various dungeons.</i>
<i>An incomprehensible amount of
time for his father to imagine.</i>
<i>A man who had been a
first-string tailback himself,</i>
<i>Kent had nurtured his son to play
since his fledgling days in pee-wee.</i>
<i>Football served as a common language
for which they had no substitute.</i>
<i>Remember when you saw
her for the first time?</i>
<i>Kissed her lips? Touched her soft skin?</i>
<i>Do you remember when you
said "I do" and meant it?</i>
<i>Well, we do, too.

<i>we know that nothing lasts forever.</i>
<i>And so if you are ready,

<i>On September 27th, 2013,
after 36 years of space travel,</i>
<i>the</i> Voyager <i>finally exited our solar
system and entered uncharted territories.</i>
<i>But not before taking this photo of
Earth from 3.7 billion miles away.</i>
<i>Yes, this is us.</i>
Who are you texting?
- Just a friend from school.
- "Just a friend from school"?
I think my daughter is texting a boy.
So what's his name?
I'm pretty sure you can let me
text without the inquisition.
<i>Look who's back for more.</i>
<i>I know what's been going through
that dirty little mind of yours.</i>
<i>Have you been following my
instructions like a good little boy?</i>
<i>Good.</i>
- Hi! Hi! Hi, what is all this?
- Hi!
We're doing a national talent
search for kids, ages 6 to 16,
who have an interest in acting.
Do you have any performing experience?
This is, like, perfect!
The application includes just
standard profile information.
And we are also going to
want her to write an essay
on where she sees herself in 10 years.
<i>Hannah knew that her future
would include a large house</i>
<i>with a swimming pool in Los Angeles,
an expensive car with tinted windows</i>
<i>to prevent paparazzi from snapping
photographs as she went shopping,</i>
<i>and an attractive boyfriend
who would be famous,</i>
<i>but perhaps not quite as famous as her.</i>
<i>She mentioned all of this in her essay.</i>
- You were so pretty up there!
- How cool would that be!
To, like, actually be on a TV show?
Pretty cool. When I think of
all the auditions and rejection
and dinners and drinks
when I lived in LA...
For you, it could be as
simple as filling out a form.
Hey, what's up?
Nothing. I just thought I'd
sit with you, if it's okay.
Yeah... Okay.
So that took courage.
It's no big deal.
I just came over and sat down.
I mean quitting football.
Yeah, I guess so.
- How'd you know about that, anyway?
- Seriously?
Like, everybody knows.
There's an article and everything.
Why... why'd you quit?
I just realized...
It didn't matter.
- Well, just like that?
- Do you know <i>Pale Blue Dot</i> by Carl Sagan?
- I've heard of Carl Sagan.
- It's just... It's about how...
We're just made up of...
billions of molecules.
Like, the same molecules that have
been around since the Big Bang.
And they'll be around until eventually
the universe crunches into nothing.
I find that comforting.
Okay.
The actions of, like, Hitler, Gandhi,
Jesus Christ,
mean absolutely nothing, then...
It's no big deal if I
don't play football.
It's no big deal if I come over
here and I sit at your table.
<i>There were many other things that
Tim wished to share with Brandy.</i>
<i>Most notably, that his mother had
left him and his father for California</i>
<i>at the beginning of the summer and had
kept in touch mainly through Facebook.</i>
<i>But he resisted.</i>
<i>While he knew, cosmically,
that nothing mattered,</i>
<i>he also realized that something
about talking to Brandy did matter,</i>
<i>at least to him. And this was enough.</i>
So, what do you think the chances
are of Timmy coming back out?
Yeah, I don't know. His heart just
didn't seem to be into it, you know?
I'm hoping it's a phase,
but this divorce has been, you know,
it's been rough on both of us.
I know you have no perspective,
fresh wounds and all,
but right now you can hit anything.
Yeah, well... I'm just not in
the hitting mood, you know.
What a waste.
Red, red, go, white, white!
White, white. Go, red, red!
Red, white.
Cute.
Red, white, white,
all together, let's fight!
Go red, red...
God!
Hope you can make it, ma'am.
Ready? Hut.
Hey!
Hey, you were... you were
pretty awesome out there.
- Thanks.
- You're cute, too.
Shouldn't have been that close.
All right, guys, hey. Here we go.
What I want you to do
is look at this number
and tell me what it means to you.
Yeah, go ahead.
It's the day the terrorists attacked
the World Trade Center?
That's right, Regina.
Other than the attack on Pearl Harbor,
it's the only time a foreign force
attacked anything on U.S. soil.
So what I want you to do is,
I want you to pair off
and you're gonna find someone to
interview that remembers that day.
All right, on Friday,
we're gonna give a presentation
on how that day changed our country.
<i>Allison Doss had developed a crush
on Brandon Lender in seventh grade.</i>
<i>It had been her greatest hope
that he would be her first kiss.</i>
<i>Brandon remained the object
of Allison's affection</i>
<i>despite having once said,
within earshot,</i>
<i>"I'd fuck her if I
could find the hole."</i>
<i>You wanna watch me.</i>
<i>I can tease you right back.</i>
Perky.
No tattoos.
Pussy is...
So, Liz, I'm hoping you
got a chance to implement
some of the Internet safety
protocol we talked about last week.
Yeah.
I think we're doing good.
I think my kids are safe.
So, you have all your
daughter's passwords?
- Hi.
- Sorry to interrupt.
My name's Kent. Is this about
the video games and stuff?
Oh, yeah, have a seat.
Hi, Kent. Welcome.
Donna, why don't you tell us
what brought you here tonight?
Thanks. Well,
my daughter is getting to an age
where she's starting to develop.
And, you know, I was just wondering,
what the laws were about what you
can and can't post on the Internet.
That's an excellent question. Because in
our state, the laws are far more lenient
- than they should be.
- They are?
Yeah. If someone is sending
photos to your daughter...
Well...
Yes, but I'm also actually
wondering about if...
if she were to send her own.
Like, if she were to take
a picture of herself
in a bathing suit or
underwear or, you know...
Oh, I see.
Donna, I know our kids aren't
thinking about their futures.
- Hannah's very driven.
- I bet she is.
Before you go, I want to give you a
pamphlet about the dangers of selfies.
- Great. Thanks, that's helpful.
- Okay.
Okay.
Did you guys know anyone
who was, inside?
Like, in it? Like actually
inside one of the buildings?
- No...
- We had friends who were in New York,
but no one got hurt.
Somehow that didn't
make it any less scary.
How... How did you guys, like, find out
that 9/11 was happening and everything?
Oh, yeah, did you get a text or what?
No. There were no texts.
The reason we got cell phones
was to make sure we could get ahold of
each other in case it ever happened again.
- Yeah, that's when everything changed.
- Yeah.
Okay. Where... Where was I?
You were in your room. Sleeping.
We didn't know if we should wake you.
Yeah, we wanted to hide it
from you as long as possible.
And what were you guys doing?
Honey?
- Want to take this one?
- Yeah, we were,
getting ready for work.
I'm pretty sure that we need some poster
board or something to put this on.
Yeah. But not, like, with the Twin Towers
blowing up or whatever or anything.
No, I don't know, with like some,
police officers or
- firemen.
- Totally patriotic.
I like that one. He's hot.
Gonna have to clear
my history after this.
What kind of things you
got hidden in your history?
Oh, you know, just photos
and things for inspiration.
Shit. I gotta go.
Well, I'll just
- finish this.
- Here.
Bookmark this shit for the
next time you need inspiration.
And, Kent? You said
something about video games?
Yeah, my son's pretty into them.
They're very dangerous.
It doesn't matter what you read,
how many studies claim that they're harmless,
I can show you better studies
that claim the contrary.
Well, he's on the computer a lot.
<i>Guild Wars,</i> I think?
That's one of the worst ones. A couple
in China played <i>Guild Wars</i> so much
they neglected their baby
and it died of dehydration.
I'm sure that's, an extreme example, no?
I can show you how to
uninstall the game.
You know, I was really just looking to
see if you knew what the game was like.
I do know what it's like, Kent.
It's a virtual world.
Your son has created an avatar of himself.
An avatar is an icon...
- ...or a representation...
- I saw the movie, yeah.
Well, then you know that an avatar
is often demonic or evil-looking.
When he's plugged in, your son
thinks that that world, the world
of <i>Guild Wars,</i> is the real world.
Our world doesn't matter anymore.
His friends don't matter.
School doesn't matter. You don't matter.
"All I know is, you don't matter, Kent."
- I don't matter!
- "You don't matter."
"Your truck doesn't matter.
Your son doesn't matter!
"And that is why I have installed
a camera in my daughter's brain
"and a seven-digit PIN
code on her vagina.
"And if you'd like,
I can show you all how to do it."
Hey...
Do...
Do you want to go out to dinner
or something or... or drinks?
Or coffee?
Or what?
I think I went through everything
you could do on a first date.
A date.
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Hey, buddy.
- How's it going?
- Hey, Dad.
- Did you have a good night?
- Yeah, we just did a dungeon.
- Did you win?
- Yeah.
All right, well...
Don't stay up too late, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
It's weird?
How long ago that all seems?
Yeah, a school report.
How old are we?
I love you.
I love you.
You remember what we were
doing that morning, right?
Yeah.
Come on.
Do you ever get nervous?
About what?
- No.
- I just think 'cause...
How come you didn't respond my message?
What message?
I wrote you on Facebook, like...
Listen, you don't...
you can be honest with me.
- Are you sure it was me?
- Yeah, pretty sure.
- Fuck.
- What?
My mom. She checks my Facebook,
my emails, my texts. She must have
just deleted it before I even saw it.
Isn't that, like,
against the law or something?
No, she thinks she's protecting me.
Is she watching us right now?
No. She just tracks me online.
Seems a little psycho.
I have a secret.
A Tumblr account.
And it's, like,
the only place I can go to
where I can just be myself.
It's not even really me.
Sometimes I just...
cut and paste stuff from other sites or
write something just to see what
it feels like to type the words.
How does it make you feel?
At first,
it's kind of like I'm wearing a costume.
And then,
after long enough,
I...
I just forget that it's not me.
Here.
Nobody knows about it. Not even my mom.
So if you get a message from
that account, you know it's me.
My mom ran off to California
with this douchebag named Greg Cherry.
They just got engaged.
She hasn't told my dad.
It's fucked.
Well,
I'm sorry.
- Hey, ladies.
- Oh, my God. Fuck off.
I didn't know your brother was
friends with Brandon Lender.
Oh, yeah. I guess.
I mean, they're both starters on
the varsity squad or something, so,
I don't know. He's a big
old bitch, if you ask me.
- Your brother or Brandon?
- Oh, they're both bitches.
Yeah. Wasn't Brandon a
total dick to you last year?
That was last year.
I mean, we were freshmen.
And now you're smokin'.
He done fucked up.
Oh, my God, who cares! Let's just
watch <i>Breaking Amish.</i> Please?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Okay, we literally watch that
every time we come over.
Yeah, Brooke, we're gonna keep watching
it till my DVR wears out and dies.
I don't even know why they
make other TV shows anymore.
- Hey.
- Hey. Where's everybody else?
They went to the store.
They needed <i>mas</i> beverages.
You can sit down if you want.
So, you must've went on, like, a <i>Biggest
Loser</i> diet or some shit over summer?
Just kind of started
watching what I ate.
Yeah? Well, it shows.
You're, like, a serious piece.
- Have you hooked up with anyone yet?
- Yeah, a little.
Yeah? Totally could now.
Cool. Thanks.
Wait...
should we...
- like...
- Oh, yeah.
So, the first time,
it's gonna hurt a little bit, but...
it's just something you kinda have to do
to get it over with.
You know what I'm saying?
Right.
Maybe we should just, like, you know...
Okay, look. We can stop if you want,
but eventually you're gonna have to do it.
But I'm not like a rapist
or some shit, so...
Okay.
No, no, it's okay.
Okay. Yeah.
I'm gonna head out and see
my sister this afternoon.
You know how she gets
with all her complaining,
she'll probably want to talk my ear
off until we're both drunk on red wine
and pass out. So I think I'll
just end up staying the night.
- Just want to give you a heads up.
- Okay.
Maybe...
I'll call Kent,
- go out for some beers tonight.
- Yeah.
You haven't done that in a while.
I'm sure he could use the company.
Good idea.
Yeah, I should be able to get something
like that together for you immediately.
Thank you.
Okay.
- Okay, thank you. Talk soon.
- I'm gonna be on TV!
First they need a video of you
doing some acting, cheerleading,
stuff around the house...
- Mom, this is it.
- Well, honey, it's a next step.
<i>Despite days of trying, Chris Truby
struggled to become fully aroused</i>
<i>while navigating Hannah Clint's website.</i>
<i>He couldn't imagine suggesting
the kinds of explicit fantasies</i>
<i>he had witnessed online to her,</i>
<i>and feared he had come to rely on them.</i>
<i>In an effort to fix what should come
naturally to any 15-year-old boy,</i>
<i>Chris employed a technique designed

So, I was gonna go to Lauren's
house to watch a movie.
Now?
- Yeah.
- It's late.
- Well, how're you gonna get there?
- I was just gonna take my bike.
- No, I'll take you.
- You seem like you're doing important work.
I don't wanna distract you
or anything. I can just go.
Okay.
Okay.
But take your phone, honey.
So I can track you.
Got it.
Okay.
Angelique?
Angelique?
- Are you "BoredWife"?
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
"SecretLuvur"?
- Oh, God.
- At your service.
You must be Don.
- Hi.
- You're cute.
Thank you.
- Do you want to sit, Don?
- Okay. Sure.
I don't really know how this
is all supposed to go down.
Well, we can finish our drinks
and then we can go on our date.
I'll have a cosmo.
- Excuse me. The lady would like a cosmo.
- I heard her.
- So much for incognito.
- Yeah, right?
Have you never done this before?
No, I don't do this kind of thing.
No, no, no.
I...
I mean, is this what we're...
Is this okay?
Oh, you're more than okay.
I know you said that on the phone,
but a lot of guys just say that.
Why? Why would they do that?
They think it makes me feel special.
That's just so weird.
I don't know. I mean,
maybe this is just too crazy.
No, no, no, look, look.
I don't want you to think that
you have to do anything tonight.
There are no rules
to this kind of thing.
But you seem really nice.
And you're fine as hell.
It is, isn't it? It's your first time.
Isn't it obvious?
- You want to go upstairs?
- Thank you.
So...
you're a photographer?
I see you... taking photos
at the games and stuff.
No, it's just a hobby. We use the
photos on Hannah's acting website.
Well, she's lucky she has a...
a mother who's, you know,
"in the business."
Tell me about it. I got my first
headshots by this guy up in Garland.
- Yeah.
- What a creep.
Told me not to forget my
swimsuit and aerobics outfit.
I hope you told him to fuck off.
I wish. I was 18. I didn't know.
I hate those photos.
Well, at least, you know,
Hannah has someone to keep
her out of trouble, right?
Yeah. I suppose.
She's actually up for this reality show.
Yeah. It's kind of a talent search.
- Could be fun.
- Yeah.
It's in Hollywood, so if she gets it
maybe she'll meet her father.
He was this producer that I met
when I went out there to be a star.
Oh, yeah, got it.
I came back five months pregnant
with this Mercedes that he bought me
and a monthly child support check.
To be fair, he never missed a
payment on either of them.
Hollywood's loss, I guess.
- Isn't that where Lydia moved?
- Yeah, she's...
going out with some,
guy named Greg Cherry.
Really, I mean "Greg Cherry"?
What kind of name is that, you know?
- It's a pretty lame one.
- It is.
So when did you start thinking
differently about her?
Honestly?
I know this is gonna...
sound like a pickup line
or something, but...
meeting you was kind
of a big deal for me.
I mean, you know, for the past year
pretty much every night I'd just...
go to bed and watch TV and...
wonder what she was doing.
But for the past week,
I go to bed and wonder
what you're doing.
I'm sorry. That was way
too much, wasn't it?
No.
It was actually pretty great.
I've slept with guys for less.
Sorry.
Do you wanna hear about what
I do for a living or something?
Yeah, you can tell me if you want to.
I'm an account services
manager at Stanley.
And what does an account
services manager do?
I coordinate
daily service sales activities and
regarding distributors.
I also,
manage relationships with
various accounts and...
and... I occasionally assist with
marketing programs relating to
distributors.
- It sounds really complicated.
- Nah, it isn't.
Oh, wow. You have such a huge dick!
<i>Don presumed his penis
to be of an average size.</i>
<i>If his dick had, in fact, been huge,</i>
<i>he would probably have
heard about it by this point.</i>
You like that?
Do you?
Yeah.
What's the matter?
You scared, little girl?
A little.
No.
I'm excited.
- I want it.
- Where do you want it?
In my mouth.
Maybe half of it?
No.
I want it all.
I want...
I want that big penis of yours.
- That's right.
- I want it. I want your dick.
Oh, attagirl.
I want you to destroy me
with your big fucking cock.
Oh, fuck, yeah.
- You still in here?
- Yes, I am.
- You've been at it for hours.
- I know.
I can't find anything. We're lucky.
Then maybe you should take
it easy on her for a while.
Maybe I'll just call her and make sure
everything's okay at Lauren's, and then...
You just checked her
entire computer, right?
Doing whatever it is you do,
checking her email or MySpace.
You said yourself she's
clean as a whistle.
Just let her be a teenager tonight.
That was cool.
Yeah.
- Was that okay?
- Yeah, you were great.
So, you still have a little
over half an hour left
if you want to take a break, go again...
You think maybe we could just
lie in the bed together and maybe you
put your head on my chest or something?
Yeah, that's fine.
Damn, baby, that was something.
Call me tomorrow.
- Hey.
- She never called.
What?
That's weird. Maybe there's
something wrong with my phone.
I should call my mom,
make sure she's okay.
Relax. Maybe she's having sex
or something with your dad.
<i>As a reminder, next weekend
is our arch-rival, Irving.</i>
<i>We want a sea of red and blue when
we go up against the Aardvarks.</i>
<i>Go, Olympians!</i>
Go, Olympians!
Dumb bitch.
- What was that?
- I said we lost because of you, fag.
How could you have lost because
of me if I wasn't even there?
That's why it's your fault, you fuckface.
We could lose district.
- Who cares?
- Everybody cares. Everybody!
All right, yeah, whatever.
Fucker! Fuck you! Fuck you!
So what do you want to know?
What do you want to tell me?
What's important in your life right now?
I don't...
My dad wants me to play football.
How do you feel about football?
I don't know, it just seems
kind of pointless to me.
Okay. What are some of the
things that aren't pointless?
I don't know. I play <i>Guild Wars.</i>
Is that a Nintendo game?
No, it's an MMORPG.
It's a role-playing game online.
You play with millions of other players.
And you're probably pretty
good at this game, right?
Yeah, I guess. I mean,
it's not really about skill. It's more
about how much time you put into it.
And the people you play this with,
they're your friends from school?
Oh, no. No.
They're just my friends from the game.
Like, I've never actually met them in R.L.
R.L.?
R.L.? In real life.
Do you have friends in R.L.?
No. I used to have a lot,
but once I stopped playing football
I sort of lost most of them.
There's a girl, though.
Oh, nice.
Is she in R.L.?
Yeah.
She's pretty cool.
Have you seen <i>Pale Blue Dot?</i>
Is that a movie or a video game?
No, it's... It's this thing,
it's this YouTube video.
I mean, it basically challenges our
existence and whether or not we matter.
Do you believe anything matters?
On a grand scale?
I think if I disappeared tomorrow,
the universe wouldn't really notice.
What?
Can I show you something?
Yeah, well, I'm kind of busy.
Just send me a pic.
- What's up?
- I only have a minute,
but I just wanted to make sure you weren't
chained up in the basement or something.
And this.
Hey, baby.
- What happened?
- We don't know, baby.
The doctor said someone found
you at school. You were bleeding.
- Hi.
- I feel fine.
I'm Doctor Stern.
How are you feeling, Allison?
Okay, I guess. Am I, like, okay, though?
Short answer is yes. Long answer is,
it's a little more complicated.
- Okay, what does that even mean?
- Let him talk.
It means I need to tell you a few things
that might seem a little shocking.
But just keep in mind your
daughter's gonna be fine.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Allison, you had what's
called an ectopic pregnancy
- and it spontaneously aborted.
- What?
- What? You were pregnant?
- How can that even happen?
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- Don't "Daddy" me!
The most important thing to
remember is your daughter's okay.
There was a fertilized egg growing
in one of Allison's fallopian tubes.
This can be quite dangerous, especially
if it ruptures. It can be life-threatening.
You're actually lucky
that it ended on its own.
You seem to be malnourished,
and I believe that's why
your body wasn't able
to handle the pregnancy.
Can I go home?
Yeah, but I'd like to keep you
overnight for observation.
We're gonna keep you on some fluids
for hydration and keep you monitored.
If you all need anything,
please have a nurse page me.
Are you angry with me?
I can't believe...
I just...
I need a little air.
<i>I'm Hannah Clint and I'm all
about keepin' it cooking.</i>
<i>And I'm all about cheering.</i>
- This is pretty great.
- Yeah...
It's still too long though, so I was thinking
maybe we could cut some of the dancing
- since it's similar to the cheering.
- No. No, the dance is important.
Okay, I'll just make some
cuts here and there then.
Cool.
You are actually pretty good at this.
Maybe I can take you with me one day.
You could be my personal editor.
Wait, my parents are still up.
We can be quiet.
One sec.
Do you want me to help?
No. One sec.
- That's good.
- Okay.
Do... Do you want me...
One sec.
Are you gonna move or I...
Yeah.
Don't you have to, like, have sex?
- I'll move then.
- No, wait.
Put it back in.
Fuck...
Is there something I'm doing wrong?
No. I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I guess I should text my mom then.
Lucky fucker! How are those titties?
Did you get your dick between them?
- No.
- Dude. What a waste.
Jesus, dude, when were
you gonna tell me?
Well, you know, I was trying
to keep it on the D.L.
You can show me photos of trannies but
you can't tell me you nailed Hannah Clint?
Hey.
Hey.
So, like, what's the deal?
What do you mean?
I mean, we haven't even talked
since last night and now you're, like,
going around spreading a
rumor that we had sex?
I'm pretty sure we did have sex,
and I might have told
some of my friends.
- So I guess, you know, that's the deal.
- I really don't think that was sex.
Would you rather I tell
everyone that you couldn't?
No! I don't know why you're
saying anything to anyone.
Because I thought that
you were my best shot.
So I just told everyone
that I lost it, and they...
They think that I lost it,
then I pretty much did, right?
That is so screwed up.
Whatever.
Okay, so I mean, like, what's the deal?
- What do you mean?
- With us. Like, what's the deal with us?
There is no deal.
Okay? I'm pretty sure you're, like,
a weird guy who has some
serious sexual issues
and I'm just not into dealing with it.
I mean, I don't...
I don't know, we can talk if you want,
but I don't really see the point.
Whatever.
I know.
Hey, come on. <i>Top Chef</i> is coming up.
Hey, I'm gonna head out to
my sister's again tonight.
You good to fend for
yourself dinnerwise?
You've been going up there a lot lately.
Is... is everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah... You know, she's...
She's just got a lot on
her plate, you know,
with work and... I don't know,
I think she just needs her sister's ear.
Of course. You want
me to give you a ride?
Oh, no, you don't...
You don't need to do that. We...
Just go out with your friends.
Go have fun! I want you to be happy.
- Oh, my gosh! How are you?
- I'm fine.
- You okay? How you feeling?
- I'm fine. Really.
- What happened?
- Nothing. It was stupid, really.
- But you're fine?
- Yeah.
- I was so worried about you.
- Oh, you don't need to be.
Los Angeles.
Hello.
<i>Hi, this is Wendy Gruding from</i>
America's Next Big Celebrity.
<i>- I'm looking for Donna?</i>
- Speaking.
<i>Hi, Miss Clint, I'm just calling to
inform you that unfortunately</i>
<i>we're unable to invite your daughter,
Hannah, to Los Angeles.</i>
Oh, no.
Is there anything...
Hannah was... was...
If you could just meet her,
I know that I could probably...
<i>Hannah's audition was really terrific.
Frankly, it was one of our best.</i>
<i>But our clearances came
across a modeling website.</i>
Yeah. Yes...
Yeah, I think that we...
Yeah, we were putting up
some of Hannah's acting
and her headshots just to show
her versatility, which... which...
<i>Are you familiar with
the content of her site?</i>
Well, I mean, some of the photos
are a bit... These kids these days,
it's... it's not the same from
when you and I were that age!
<i>Our producers found that the
materials on your daughter's site,</i>
<i>the photos might be deemed by
our network as unwholesome.</i>
Was there a particular photo?
Because it'd be very...
<i>We answer to our advertisers
and they're very risk-averse.</i>
<i>Anything that could possibly
be thought of as unseemly...</i>
But we could take down the site.
It'd be so simple.
<i>We live in a time when there
is simply no such thing.</i>
<i>- All it takes is one download.</i>
- Why would anyone download...
<i>We really wish you and your
daughter the very best of luck.</i>
But, you know, kids are
emailing photos and texting.
- And it's hardly unique, I have to say...
<i>- It's unique to sell them.</i>
Wha...
I don't know what you're...
But I mean, we never...
- I would never...
<i>- We wish you the best of luck.</i>
Okay.
Thank you.
- Did I do something?
- No, no, no.
No, I don't know what to...
Can I get you... I haven't done
this for a while, so if I...
If you know, listen, there's some
protocol that I'm supposed to follow...
No, it's about Hannah.
It was just supposed to be a place for
photos and her resume...
- ...and clips from plays.
- What are you talking about?
Her website.
And then one day I got a
message from a stranger.
A fan of Hannah who wanted
to pay for a modeling session.
I knew it wasn't normal,
but the photos were...
I mean, they... It was the
same thing as catalogue work.
So...
I added a tab to the bottom of the
website that said "Private Photo Shoots."
- Jesus!
- I never let her read any of the emails.
But the acting classes and,
you know, it's...
I took photos of my daughter.
And they were meant...
I don't know how we got there, but...
I just had to tell you that.
Why?
Because I thought if I never...
If I never talked about it,
I wasn't doing anything wrong.
Donna, you're the first
woman that I've...
You know, since my wife left me.
Maybe we should just...
Slow things down.
Did you get some good shots?
Actually, I didn't bring my camera.
I just came to talk to Kent.
You're so on his jock!
Hey, what is up with that TV show?
I mean, I'm pretty sure they said
they were gonna let us know by, like,
the end of the week, and it's
pretty much the end of the week.
So, I don't know...
What do you think the deal is?
We didn't get it.
Why? I don't... I mean...
I don't get it. I mean,
I'm pretty sure I must have been
one of the best ones. What...
Did they not like the
video or something?
Honey, they didn't like our website.
Well, then screw them.
I thought about it,
and they're right.
I took down the site.
You what?
- What about all of my fans?
- If you wanna act, you can act.
We will get you into every
theater program that we can.
But that show and the website,
that's not what you want to do.
Yes, it is. Mom, it is!
- It is everything that I wanna do!
- You're better than that stupid show
- and you're better than the website.
- No, I'm not!
- No, you have to put it back up.
- I can't.
Yes, you can.
Just push a fucking button!
I've allowed you certain flexibility,
but right now I have to be your mom.
No, you're being a selfish bitch.
It's gone!
I deleted it.
Jameson, rocks.
Oh, God.
I wouldn't bother.
I changed your passwords.
Why would...
What is wrong with you?
You don't seem to understand
how dangerous it is on there.
The only thing that's dangerous
in this house, Mom, is you!
- I'm protecting you.
- From what, having a normal life?
Give me your phone.
No.
You can give me your phone or I
can call and cancel the service
and remote swipe all the
crap you put on there.
It's not like you haven't
already read all of it, anyway.
What's going on, Dad?
Great group of...
friends you play with there.
Had some real nice things to say
about having sex with your mother.
You don't understand.
They're just jokes, okay.
Yeah, Selkis... That's how you
pronounce his name? "Silk-eez"?
Yeah, he prefers to have reverse cowgirl
so he doesn't have to look
your mother in the face.
I wasn't supposed to know, okay.
I figured you weren't, either.
- What the hell's that mean?
- I saw an album on Facebook.
She posted it, and I caught
it before she blocked me.
She corrected it, like,
within a few minutes.
- She wasn't trying to hurt us.
- She didn't want to hurt us?
She abandoned us!
She abandoned you.
Oh, really? She got a bedroom
for you out there in California?
Did you get your wedding invite yet?
She abandoned us!
Your mom's gone. Yeah, she's gone.
She got bored with
the scenery and split.
So it's just you and me,
and that's how it's gonna be.
Probably forever.
All right, Dad, whatever.
- And you're playing football next year.
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not!
I understand you needed
the year to, you know,
have your space and stuff,
but you belong on that team.
I don't even fucking like football, Dad.
Okay? I like <i>Guild Wars!</i>
Fuck that stupid game.
It's a waste of time.
No, that's all it is, is time!
And I've put in months of my life and I...
- I'm invested now, okay?
- Not anymore, you're not.
- Because I canceled it.
- You mean, you deleted the application?
- Okay, I'll reinstall it. Thanks, Dad.
- No, you won't.
I called my credit card company
and told them to delete your account.
So, it's gone.
What?
Why would you do that?
Because... whether you like it or not,
I'm doing this for your own good.
Brandy?
Brandy?
- Where's Tim?
- In his room. Hey!
Tim! Tim!
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Christ!
- Oh, shit!
- Get a phone!
Hey, Dad.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
You're really beautiful, you know that?
I'd like to explain last night.
I don't know how we got here.
I just... It's like we slipped,
and before we knew it
the whole reason we started dating or...
- had a family just...
- What do you want?
I don't... But I... I don't...
Cheddar? Swiss? Scallions? Tomatoes?
I don't know what I was looking for
- when I went online...
- Chives?
I could do turkey bacon.
I understand you're upset. I just...
I just want to know what
you'd like in your eggs.
Don, we need to talk about this.
- I've made mistakes.
- So have I.
Oh, yeah.
So have I.
Probably worse than you.
I don't know, Helen... That's just it.
What's... What's just it?
Well, we could sit here and tell each
other everything we've ever done.
Shit, everything we've ever thought.
It might take a while.
But, yeah, we could
clear everything up and
go to sleep tonight with some
pretty vivid pictures in our heads.
Or you could just tell me
what you want for breakfast.
