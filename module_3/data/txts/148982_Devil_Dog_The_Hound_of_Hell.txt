- Mr. Lundmark.
- Come on in.
Good morning.
- How you folks doin' today?
- Very well.
You were recommended in
the National Breeders Guide.
They said you have
some very good dogs.
You won't find any better.
What can I show you?
The breed doesn't matter,
but the dog must be
very special.
Well, come on back here.
Got some exceptional pups.
Show quality.
Come on!
Quiet down, fellows!
You mentioned puppies.
We're not interested in puppies.
We want a female dog,
your very best.
Intelligent, healthy,
one who's already given birth
to a litter and proven herself.
And that's in season now,
ready to breed.
Well, sure we...
we have animals
for breeding. I...
I raise show dogs, but...
champion stock breeder like that...
- It's gonna be expensive.
- That doesn't matter.
Alright, let's go back here,
take a look at the Lady.
Right over here.
This is Lady.
She is as good as they come.
She has had two litters already,
three of her pups are
Blue River winners.
She's great around children too.
Raised her round my own grandkids.
That isn't necessary.
She won't be around children.
That isn't like her at all!
She does never shy @@@.
Lady!
Come here, baby!
How much?
Well, I was planning on breeding her
with my champion stock tomorrow.
Now, I could get...
six, eight pups,
and sell'em for
$500, $600 each one.
How much?
Well, I don't know...
The truth is...
I'm very fond with Lady.
I'd like to know
why you want her.
We're not adopting a child,
we're buying a dog.
I'm afraid I'd have to have
a minimum of...
$5.000.
She is the one.
1000 years mankind has waited.
1000 years since
he were chained
in the bowels of Hell and
vanished from the earth.
1000 years since those who
call themselves "blessed"
defeated you.
And now, your time has come again,
we have prepared.
We have followed the law.
We yearn for you, we lust
for you, Father of Darkness.
Send your demon,
your son,
your seed, your beast.
And take your rightful place
as master of the earth, thru us.
Send him now,
for whom we call.
Send the beast...
<b>DEVIL DOG
The Hound of Hell</b>
Barghest! Barghest!
Come! Come!
<i>Barghest, Barghest,
Come, come...</i>
Barghest, Barghest...
<i>Barghest, Barghest...</i>
Barghest...
<i>Barghest, Barghest...</i>
Barghest...
<i>Barghest, Barghest,
Barghest, Barghest...</i>
Good night, Mr. Barry.
Good night, Scottie.
See you in the morning.
Hi, gorgeous,
How about a lift?
Add only a dinner
and a deal.
I'll barbecue the stakes
if you do the dishes.
That talk @@@
have all day.
What's that?
Remember that man, Max,
I told you about?
You know, the one I said it was a drawn
that wouldn't talk to anybody?
This is unbelievable.
In only 4 weeks, darling.
He started out just using carbons,
then he started getting into line drawing,
It's a memory from his childhood.
- That's wonderfull!
- Isn't it?
Do you know he gave it to me
for Bonnie's birthday?
Isn't it fantastic to think that only
4 weeks ago he couldn't talk?
And you know I love you?
I have an idea.
Maybe we should stop off.
Dinner for two,
a @@@ restaurant,
all dark inside,
candles on the table.
Would you believe
I had the same idea?
- Except...
- No except.
Charlie will be home from
basketball practice any minute,
and Bonnie's dance class
is over in half an hour
we have to pick her up,
I know...
Except that it's monday, and all of
the restaurants close on monday.
But it's a date for tomorrow,
and don't you forget it!
You got a date.
- Mike!
- Yeah.
Oh, my God!
Mike, it's Skipper!
Betty, get back in the car.
Go on, get back in the car.
Gotta get him out
of the street.
<i>Betty!</i>
Betty, I saw the hit.
I didn't think anybody
could do a think like that.
Like what?
I was out, watering my lawn, and
Skipper came over to play with Prince.
All the sudden, he took off
down the street.
I tought maybe was one of those raccoons
again so I yell, but he just kept on running.
Then this big black Station Wagon
that was parked down by the corner,
started out and I saw it
hit him, right here.
I jumped in my car and tried
to follow, but I lost it.
Mike...
They killed Skipper...
Some people just don't care.
Well, thanks, George.
Did the kids see it?
I don't think so, I saw Charlie come
home on his bicycle. He was inside.
I don't think Bonnie is home yet.
I loved him...
I loved that little dog.
Well, here we are!
Peppermint, pistaccio,
and raspberry as ordered.
Where's the cake?
María!
Bring in the cake!
María?
Darling, I gave María
the rest of the day off.
Bonnie decided she didn't want a party
after all, I've called all the parents.
- That bad?
- Just don't wanna see anyone.
Bonnie honey, hey...
How many times you get
to be 10 years old?
Look at all the food and the presents
and decorations and everything.
Skipper never ran out
like that before, daddy.
He never chased cars
or anything.
No, but he did chase raccoons.
Maybe that's what he did.
Maybe he ran off
after a raccoon.
Charlie, how can you eat
in a time like this?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just wasn't thinking.
Sweetheart, you know daddy and I
said we'll get you another dog.
I don't want another dog, mommy.
If something happened to me,
would you'd just stay
and get another daughter?
- Honey...
- Skipper's just special.
She'll be okay, mom.
- Bonnie!
- What do you think you're doing?
Bonnie, I miss Skipper too, ok?
Now, can I ride with you?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like that.
Hi, kids!
Do you think your mom
would like some
nice fresh corn,
or cucumbers?
Or maybe...
just maybe, some of
my choice apples.
Did you grow this?
Oh, yes. I got my little place
just outside the town.
Would you like a free sample?
Yes, sir. My daddy himself
planted the tree from which this
choice apples came from.
Here's a couple of real good ones.
Full of vitamins.
Look at this puppies!
Bonnie, come over here!
Go ahead, hold it!
Is it okay?
I mean, the mother's in there.
Oh, Lady?
Don't mind her,
she's a good old girl,
she would hurt nobody.
Go ahead, hold one of
this puppies if you like.
Oh, he's really cute.
Here.
Wanna hold it?
Go ahead, hold it.
He won't eat you up.
Maybe you better
take him back.
Oh.
Hold him a minute.
Well...
I gotta find a home for this
new pups before sundown.
Oh, I think that little fellow has
already picked you up, sweetheart.
Oh, Charlie, can we?
Well, I don't know.
Mom and dad did say we
could have a new dog, but...
I just think we ought
to ask them first.
But it's my birthday, Charlie!
And I love him.
Well...
Well if there's gonna be
a problem with the folks,
I sure don't wanna
cause any trouble.
Don't worry, there'll be plenty of
kids who want this little fellow.
No, please! I...
We'll take him.
- I guess it's ok.
- Good!
You see that, Lady?
They picked your favorite son first.
You lucky kids.
He's the best one!
Thank you!
Come on, Charlie!
He likes ice cream,
just like Skipper did.
What you're gonna name him?
I'm gonna name him: "Lucky".
I'll get it.
He likes it.
George!
I just thought my partner and I might bring
a little birthday present over for Bonnie.
How sweet of you!
If it's alright that Prince comes in, he
promises not to sit in anybody's lap
or drink all the goldfish's water.
Of course, come on in!
Next to you he's almost
a welcome guest.
Well, thank you.
- How's Bonnie feeling today?
- Come and see for yourself.
- Look who is here!
- Hi, George.
A new puppy!
Bonnie @@@
Mr. Basket, isn't him something?
But I'll like your gift too.
Thank you.
Prince!
What's the matter with you?
Mike, Betty, I'm really sorry.
He never acted like that before.
I'll pay for the damage, ok?
Don't worry.
It's alright, it's alright.
Dad, I never want that
awful dog in the house again.
Don't you worry, honey.
I'm sure from now on, George
will keep him in the backyard.
But I'm afraid
your cake is smashed.
Oh, that's okay.
The best birthday I've ever had.
- María!
- Good morning, señora.
You skip day off!
I know, but I was thinking
on Bonnie all night,
so I thought maybe I come
over and take it to the party.
You know how much
she loves the parties.
- I know.
- María!
Oh, darling.
How are you?
It was the best party!
You shouldn't have left!
We ate all the wonderful
cakes that you baked,
except that Mr. Basket's dog ran off
the table and smashed the whole thing!
@@@
- Oh, yeah.
Wait to see what I got.
It's like a miracle! A man
just appeared after you left,
and gave Bonnie
a beautiful present.
Another one?
@@@
Isn't it divine?
- What is it, María?
- Oh, nothing, nothing!
Bonnie, take the puppy outside?
I bet you @@@ broken and he's gonna
make me wash the kitchen all over again.
- Darling, take the dog out, would you?
- Yeah.
Hello, María.
Everybody tucked in?
I'm sorry to bother you,
señor Barry, but...
Could I talk to you?
Yeah, sure.
Come on in.
Sit down.
I don't know what to say, but...
Kids givin' you bad time?
I know they never clean their rooms.
No, you know I love Bonnie and Charlie
since the first day I worked here
and Charlie was
just a little baby.
What is it then?
I don't know what to say.
- Sr. Barry, it's the new dog.
- What about him?
I don't know what it is.
It's like a chill.
He gives me a scary
feeling all over.
Please, Sr. Barry,
get another cute puppy before the
kids get too much attached to him.
María...
That's the sweetest
pup in the world!
See the @@@ on him?
It's gonna make a great watch dog
when he grows up.
Please, Sr. Barry,
trust me.
It's the feeling of evil!
I've felt it before,
and I'm never wrong!
I...
I'll certainly think
about this, María.
Thank you, Sr. Barry.
Thank you.
Would you hurry?
@@@
one of these days.
Girls are supposed to spend
hours getting ready, not boys.
Daddy, if you don't hurry,
we'll miss everything!
Would I miss everything?
- Do you think Lucky will be alright?
- Oh, he will be fine.
María says
she'll take care of him.
María?
Yes, Mr. Barry?
We're leaving to school now.
Don't worry,
I'll take care of everything.
Have a good time
at that place.
- Bye.
- Good night.
Santa María, madre de Dios, ruega,
señora, por nosotros, los pecadores,
ahora y en la hora de
nuestra muerte, Amén.
Dios te salve María, llena eres
de gracia, el Señor es contigo...
Santa María, madre de Dios, ruega,
señora, por nosotros, los pecadores,
ahora y en la hora de
nuestra muerte, Amén.
Dios te salve María, llena eres
de gracia, el Señor es contigo.
Bendita tú eres
entre todas las mujeres,
bendito es el fruto
de tu vientre, Jesús.
It's almost midnight, kids.
Come on, get to bed.
- I gotta have a donut first.
- You don't need a donut. Come back here.
I gotta have something
after that awful play.
I smell smoke.
María!
Oh, my God!
Maybe it's the roller.
I think maybe we need
to hire a new gardener.
The day I can't cut my own grass, I'm
gonna turn in my bed as the handyman.
How do they look, daddy?
Very pretty.
And very grown up.
Hello, my love!
Can you believe her?
Last year she had to have
a dog for the birthday,
and this year she could't live
without having her ears pierced.
You must be crazy!
How could you put yourself thru that?
Oh, it didn't hurt.
And I was the last girl
in my bunch to get it done.
And look what I got
for Lucky.
An anniversary present.
Lucky! Lucky!
Come on, boy!
Come here!
Come on, Lucky!
Happy first year, Lucky.
Happy anniversary, boy.
Well, I'm gonna go take
a look at this new earrings.
- Why don't you do that?
- That is just cutie.
How coud you do
such a stupid thing?
- I don't understand that dog.
- Lucky?
I've been working for months,
he wouldn't let me pat him.
Oh, darling.
Lucky loves you!
I've been around dogs ever
since I was a kid. It's just that...
I don't know, it's something...
...something different about him.
I think you're imagining things.
Hey, listen...
We're going to dinner, remember?
Don't work 'till late.
- Half hour?
- Fine.
No, I won't!
Lucky!
I really do hate to work on
saturday, honey, but I have to.
- @@@ I'll never catch up.
- Don't worry about it!
- What you're gonna do?
- I don't know.
I thought I'd spend
the day with the children.
There's a marvelous new exhibit
of ancient art at the Museum.
They're gonna love it!
Anyway, if they don't, I will!
I don't seem to see
much of them anymore.
- Well, they do grow up, you know?
- I know.
- Darling...
- What?
Why don't we do something
together, all of us, tonight?
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If I finish early at night,
I'll take you all @@@
Have a good day.
Charlie?
Bonnie?
Bonnie!
Bonnie?
Charlie?
Charlie...
What are you doing?
Where have you two been?
I said: What are you doing
sneaking around in here?
I found this in your room.
What is this?
It's just paint.
It looks like blood.
Leave my things alone!
Get out of my room and forget
all about this. I mean it.
What's the matter
with the two of you?
I'm sorry mom, really. I didn't mean
to be rude, honest. It's just that...
- We worked so hard!
- We wanted to surprise you, mom!
Come on, let's wash that
@@@ of your hands.
What you mean surprise me?
Well, it's just some dumb
art project, you know.
You'll see it later.
Now, come on, I'm starving.
I wanna get some breakfast.
Come on, Lucky.
Come on, mom!
- Hello?
- Hi, sweetheart.
Mike!
<i>Yeah, listen, I know I said
that we'd go out tonight...</i>
Mike, you're still at the office?
<i>Yeah, it's gonna be late
when I can go.</i>
- Mike, I need you here now.
- What's the matter?
It's the children.
<i>- Are they ok?
- Yes, they're ok, but...</i>
<i>I really can't @@@,
I'll tell you what:</i>
<i>I promise @@@ we'll have
a drink and a long talk, okay?</i>
Mike, wait, please!
Where are you two going?
You know I said I was goin' to
Susan's house down the street.
I got karate class tonight, mom.
- Oh, no, you don't.
- I can't miss the first lesson.
Will you wait a minute?
Wait!
- Mike!
- Look, I gotta go. See you later.
Mike, wait a minute!
Hello?
Charlie?
Bonnie?
Bonnie!
Betty?
Betty?
Betty?
Betty?
Michael?
Well...
I wished one apologize
for working late, but...
maybe I should
work nights more often.
I've been waiting for you
all evening.
This does mean that little talk about
the kids is going to be postponed?
That was just a
misunderstanding.
Maybe we should
return at the house.
I have an even better idea.
What?
Where are you going?
To swim.
In George's pool at this hour?
What if George wakes up?
Come on in, Mike.
Why not?
Come on in.
Prince!
What is the matter
with you, Prince?
George!
Now you keep quiet.
George...
George, that dog of yours...
Betty, I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Well, he's been barking day and night.
All the neighbors are complaining.
I know. I can't show my face
around here anymore.
Well, that's a real shame, but I @@@
something about it immediately.
Well, what am I goin' to do?
I've tried everything.
I've had Prince for 8 years,
he's always been well behave.
Maybe he's just
getting old and senile.
A vet could put him
out of this misery.
Betty, how can you say that?
Specially, since is your dog
that's to blame.
Lucky?
Lucky is an angel!
Lucky doesn't bother anybody.
Your dog is been getting
all the complaints.
Betty, the last thing in the world
I'll ever do is put that dog to sleep!
<i>He has no reason to say that
@@@</i>
<i>Crazy old man. Why don't you
move out of our neighborhood?</i>
<i>Yeah. @@@
Nobody wants you around here.</i>
<i>I think you'd better
get off our property, now.</i>
Don't let them tell you @@@
but it was their dog @@@
- What's this all about?
- I'm glad you're here.
That animal of yours
finally killed Prince.
I just found him dead.
Wait just a minute.
Lucky killed Prince?
Come and see for yourself.
My God!
He's ripped to pieces.
I want that dog destroyed!
That dog was locked up
in the house all night!
Don't you hurt our dog!
I'll kill you, you old creep!
Stop it!
Charlie, stay out of this!
Stop it, both of you!
George, I'm sorry you lost your dog.
I know how much he meant to you, but...
Why don't we let this cool off
and just talk about it like friends?
He's not friend of ours, Michael.
Look, folks. You'll have
to settle this yourselves.
Without proof, I don't see why
this is a police matter, sir.
Well, it will be a police matter when
that dog kills a kid or something!
Look, if you don't do your duty and
take that dog away, I'll kill it myself!
I swear I will!
I'll shoot him!
Come on, kids.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm sorry, George.
We'll see how you like it
when you find your dog dead.
- You heard that?
- No.
You must have been
dreaming, darling.
This bed is getting awfully cold.
Why don't you come on back?
- Good morning, darling.
- Good morning.
You know? I can't get
George out of my life.
Honey, maybe we ought to go over there
and try to make peace with him.
I have nothing
to say to George.
Come on, we do have somethin' to say to him.
He has been our friend for 15 years.
That dog was everything to him
- What are you two laughing at?
- Nothing.
Well, I think
I'm gonna go over.
- What about your breakfast?
- I'll have it later.
- You wanna come, Charlie?
- I have to take this to the library.
Wait, what's this?
- Politics?
- Yeah, the anual elections.
That's great!
What you think
your chances are?
100%
- What about you, Bonnie?
- @@@
- Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Bye, mom. Bye, dad.
George?
George!
Mr. Amory, my parents
said you were coming by.
- I thought I was getting straight A's.
- It's not about your grades, Charlie.
- You've great grades.
- Oh, good.
It's real good. You know, you always get
a little worried with the council conspiracy...
- I think you know exactly why I'm here.
- Miles, good to see you. It's been a long time.
Come on in.
- It's Betty here?
- Yes, she's in the desk.
Betty?
Miles.
My son is making
straight A's in school,
he's just been elected class president and
you say you're worried about him, Miles.
@@@
Cream or sugar?
Not.
This Charlie is so bright and so
special that I'm concerned about him.
It's not his grades,
it's not he's class president,
but is how he got
to be class president.
I don't understand.
Well, it's difficult for me
to understand, Mike.
Charlie just seems to be
willing to stop at nothing.
@@@, isn't it?
I mean, since when are we
rewarded for been bad?
Well, just exactly
what has Charlie done?
I think he has hurt someone,
very badly.
- Who?
- There's this kid, Bobby Affleck.
He was running
for class president.
Very bright and dedicated boy,
and everybody thought he'd win.
Then the day of the election...
- You must have heard this from Charlie.
- No, we didn't. - No.
The day of the election,
Bobby Affleck was found with
a stolen watch in his locker.
Very witnesses said they
actually saw him take it.
Course, the upshot was that he got
suspended and lost the election.
And Charlie won.
You didn't want a thief
to win, did you?
Bobby Affleck
isn't a thief, Betty.
I think Charlie was
behind the whole thing.
That he planted the watch, that he
got his friends to lie about Bobby.
Betty, I suspect he destroyed
the terrific kid just to win.
You think?
You suspect.
Just, what do you think we
should do about it, Miles?
I hate to say this, Mike, but I think
Charlie needs some professional help.
A psychiatrist maybe.
Look, don't jump on that,
it's just simply, his changing
is not for the better,
but a kind of corruption is
creeping into his personality.
I can't explain it.
Miles, I...
I'd appreciate if you could
recommend a doctor.
- Nonsense!
- Not just for Charlie, but for Bonnie too.
- The children are not going to...
- @@@ hear this, Miles, but
we had a similar report on Bonnie
just this last week; in fact, a couple.
- I don't really think is any Miles business...
- Yes, I think it is!
Bonnie is fine, there's
nothing wrong with Bonnie.
There is something wrong with Bonnie.
She's lying, stealing, cheating...
And if she's manipulating them the way she
manipulates us now. We've got to stop it.
Well...
I think we've said everything
that need saying.
Good night, Miles.
Betty, he's only
concerned about the kids!
I said: "good night, Miles".
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have
to look into this further.
If you're not gonna do anything,
then I'm gonna have to do it.
Good night, Betty.
Come on, boy.
Try here.
Gotta run fast as a @@@
- Come on, boy.
- Go get it. Come on.
Come on, Lucky.
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, dad!
Mom said you won't be home for dinner.
Said we should order a pizza.
- Where is she?
- At the mentals hospital.
- She never goes to the hospital at night.
- They are having an art show.
You know, stuff the guys
from the therapy class did.
Come on, Lucky! Let me have it!
Let me have it, come on! Come on!
Come on, let go!
Let go!
Lucky, come on!
Come on, Lucky!
Come on, Lucky!
Alright, I'll be
the first one to speak.
Speak away.
You weren't at the art show tonight.
I call the mental hospital.
Checking up on me?
I'm surprised.
Where were you?
Visiting a friend.
Who?
I don't like been given
a dirty @@@
And I don't like been lied too.
What is it, Betty? What's goin' on?
You're acting like some kinda stranger.
Will you cut it out?
I went to see Miles, to talk him about
Charlie to see if he changed his mind.
At night?
In that dress?
Yes, at night in this dress!
It just so happens I tought
he might be more persuaded.
- Persuaded?
- Yes, persuaded.
You tried to seduce him?
It just so happens that
I care about Charlie's future.
I don't wanna see him hurt.
I don't believe that.
You wouldn't do it
and even if you did,
Miles would never fall for it.
It's great! Miles wouldn't
fall for a thing like that?
Miles did.
Where do you think
you're going?
Miles is my friend.
Maybe he'll level with me.
I won, I won!
- Miles is dead.
- I know, we heard.
Come on, mom.
You promised to play the winner.
You don't think you're
gonna beat me, do you?
Don't you know I was
girls state champion?
Miles is dead.
Don't you got anything to say?
Yeah.
Nobodu flungs English now.
Get out.
Get out of here, both of you!
Go to your room, now! Get out!
Your lover's killed
and you don't bat an eye.
My lover?
What are you talking about, Michael?
Why do you think
I went there last night?
I don't honestly know.
And I suppose you honestly
don't know why Lucky was there.
Why was sitting there
watching Miles die.
Well...
We must train that dog not
to chase your car, Michael.
I mean, he could
get hurted.
Don't!
What in God's name is this?
It's just a picture.
You were up here 3:00 in the
morning, painting that picture?
That's right.
Walking around chanting
and burning candles?
Just painting.
- Why?
- So we could finish.
It's really rather cute,
don't you think, darling?
You're out of your mind?
Children, bedtime!
Come on, sweet girl!
Mike, EKG great,
blood is normal,
glucose is normal,
urine, chest...
All the rest checks
are just fine.
Only wish I could give you the same
report when you're back here.
Well, thanks @@@
appreciate.
Mike, you weren't due
for a physical for 6 months.
Wanna tell me what
you think is wrong?
Well, I just want to
make sure I was alright.
I was thinkin'
about taking a trip.
A trip?
You didn't mention any trip to me.
- Didn't I?
- Mike, come on.
You don't call at us for an inmediate appointment,
unless there's something more than that.
Look, you got a lot of people
waiting for you out there.
Hey, wish to talk
a few minutes?
I wanna help. It's what I get
paid for. It's good for my ego.
What's the problem, Mike?
I was almost wishing that
you find something wrong.
I was hoping an explanation.
For what?
Things that have been
happening lately.
Terrible things, I...
I feel foolish of
even talkin' about it.
It's as if...
some evil power has
moved into my house.
My family has changed.
Charlie and Bonnie...
...they're different.
And Betty...
...she's cold... strange.
You wouldn't believe her.
She's somebody else.
I can't even
recognize her anymore.
The strangest @@@
there is some kind of
conspiracy against me.
How long has
this been goin' on?
Ever since we got
that new dog.
- Lucky?
- Yeah, Lucky.
Before this I couldn't believe that
Lucky had anything to do with the...
the deaths of
three people, friends.
- You mean Miles Amory?
- Yeah.
And my next door neighbour,
George, his dog...
Look, I know this all
sounds crazy, but...
it's all true.
Things has been
@@@ at work?
Oh, no, no. Wait.
No, no...
Don't tell me
that I'm overworked.
No, I remember on your birthday, when
the people down at the play gave you
a clock with no hands,
@@@
Mike, I think you need to stand back
and take a good look at the situation.
You know, 2 weeks in Hawaii alone with
Betty will do you both a world of good.
And I'm gonna give you this
prescription, some tranquilizers.
You haven't believed
a word I said!
Course I have, Mike!
Most of all, I believe
that you believe it.
But the first one to help you
is gotta be yourself.
No, it's not me! It's not me,
don't you see? It's them!
It's my wife,
my kids, that dog!
Somebody's gotta help me!
Tragedy and terror
at the southlands,
as the fire sweeps through
an industrial farming...
What are you doin' home?
- I didn't go to work.
- Oh, that's obvious!
Since when does Mr. Workoholic
miss a day at the office?
You like my new hat?
Isn't it heaven?
You know, shopping
release tension.
You really owe to try it sometime.
It might make you feel better.
I thought this was you day
at the mental hospital.
God, those art classes?
Not anymore.
- Since when?
- A bunch of basket cases.
I wasted enough time on them
already. It's all too depressing.
Besides, I've got better
things to do with my time.
Betty, what's happening?
Darling, would you like a drink?
First, María dead, then
George, his dog, Miles...
Then the kids change
and now you.
- What is it?
- You know? I think I will fix you a drink.
Look, I don't want a drink!
I just want you to listen.
I've been thinkin' about this
all day and somehow is all...
it all involves Lucky.
- Lucky?
- Yes.
Yes, María tried
to worn me about him.
She felt there was
something evil in him.
I didn't pay any attention.
You're @@@ crazy?
There's nothing odd with Lucky,
Lucky is a marvelous dog.
- Marvelous?
- He wouldn't hurt a fly.
Well, that damn dog tried to force me
to put my hand on a lawnmower
Yeah, I know, I didn't allow myself to
believe it at the time. But it happened!
You know? If I weren't worried
about you I'd think you ain't joking.
No, Michael.
If there's anything wrong with this family,
If there's anyone who has changed, it's you!
You know it well.
I thought myself
maybe I was sick,
in fact, I hoped so.
That's why I stayed home today.
I went out to the medical center
and I had @@@ give me a physical.
I'm in perfect health.
And you told him
about this thing?
Yes, so he prescribed 2 weeks
in Hawaii and tranquilizers.
He said I've been
working too hard
and he took me down the hall
to meet a colleague of his,
- a psychiatrist
- Oh, and you told him?
Oh, yes, told him everything.
He was very interested.
He said we had to get
together more often
in analysis.
And I said "no".
I'm not about to spend
months on a damn couch!
There isn't time, Betty.
Not while there's a danger in
this house. There is not time!
What are you talking about?
Look, I...
I wanna get rid of the dog.
And break your children's hearts.
They're crazy about that dog!
I'm telling you he's evil!
That he is evil!
I think I'll change.
- And then make dinner.
- Bett...
...barricated against the police
after an wild rampage,
during which he allegedly shot
and killed 3 of his neighbours
I'm Bob Navarro. I'm near
a man barricated in his home
You can hear the gunfires.
Mrs. Hadley, I know this is
a difficult time for you,
but please, can you tell us
what's happening here?
I don't know. My husband never
did anything like this before.
Never!
I keep telling them that!
Mrs. Hadley,
how did this started?
It was the dog!
He kept saying it was the dog.
The dog next door that forced him
to kill all those people!
- I don't know.
- What dog?
The dog that @@@ over there!
Mrs. Hadley, has your husband
ever had a history of mental illness?
No, no! Never!
No, really!
He has never had
any problem, never.
- How long...?
- Leave! Leave!
I don't wanna talk
about it anymore!
Thank you.
You've been listening
to Mrs. Gloria Hadley,
the wife of the man who's barricated
in that house back there.
I'm Bob Navarro, in Maple avenue,
returning now to the KVDX feature.
Dad?
- Dad, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, children, but he has to go.
- Why, dad? Why?
- Just because!
Come on, boy, get in there!
Go on, get in there, go on!
Why are you doin' this?
Because I'm afraid of him.
I hate you!
Don't you hurt our dog!
Don't you ever
come back here again!
You'll never forgive
yourself for this.
I'm sorry, Bonnie.
Now, get away from the car!
- Please, dad, no!
- Please!
I'm sorry, boy.
I'm sorry if I'm wrong,
but I gotta do it.
Hi, dad.
Where have you been?
We've all been
so worried about you.
Lucky's been home for hours.
Have you ever heard
of the Barghest?
The Barghest?
No, what is it?
A creature of another world
and another time.
According to those who believe.
The demon, who appears
in the form of a dog.
Is Lucky a Barghest?
It's possible, but there's
no way to really knowing.
You gotta see the Barghest
in it's true form to be certain.
Perhaps you've heard him
in the night.
Is a sound that's just
not of this earth.
A sort of hi pitch shriek.
Yes.
Yes, I have heard it.
The night my neighbour's dog
was killed.
I really want to help you,
but I only run a shop.
I'm not a practitioner.
Why has it picked my family?
I don't know that either.
But, there must be some design.
And course, it could simply be
my imagination, you know.
I could be cracking up,
a classic case of paranoia,
a man haunted by his dog.
You will have to decide that.
This... Barghest.
What does it look like?
It's a monstruous thing,
a goblin-dog,
with huge teeth and claws.
Monstruous.
It only appears at night.
Wait.
Think I can
show you about it.
Ah, here.
The demon dog,
the black dog,
the dog of darkness,
sometimes he runs with
backward pointed feet,
sometimes he has a blaze,
sometimes he is headless.
But, even a glimpse of
the beast in it's true form
would send a man to hell.
You've gotta help me.
Oh, dear...
Let me see that painting again
you said your children made.
Perhaps it can tell us something.
It's a pity  it isn't
a one-eyed devil,
one-eyed devil is
not your brightest.
But the three-eyed devils
are all-seeing, the cleverest.
I have never seen
one like this before.
Here!
Here, look!
I found something!
Let me see.
The demon of unknown origin
painted on a cliff, outside
the city of Quito, Ecuador.
@@@
But it's all there is,
isn't anymore.
I'm afraid this book is rather
incomplete, but it's a start.
Yes, it is.
It is a start.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I really, really
want to help you,
Perhaps I can.
Your children...
They say, if you are
one of the blessed,
one of the selected few who can
oppose the forces of darkness,
you may hold a mirror to
the face of a sleeping person
and look at the reflection.
You then can see the
true state of the soul,
if you dare.
Ladies and gentlemen.
We will be arriving in Quito, Ecuador,
in approximately 15 minutes.
Mr. Barry!
You want to go now?
No, not yet!
Mr. Barry, you've been
here all the afternoon!
It's getting late.
Mr. Barry, this is not gonna
wake up and talk to you.
It's only paint and stone.
The people that painted this had
been  dead for over 1000 years.
I came all this way.
There must be somebody
who can help me.
Maybe.
- Who?
- I...
I left that a long time ago, Mr. Barry,
and I came down from the mountains.
I don't believe
that old stuff anymore,
and I don't see how a man
like you is going to believe.
I have to believe.
Is my great-grandfather.
But is a long way.
A long, long way.
Two days drive, maybe.
This is as far as I can go.
He is up there...
somewhere.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
- I'm going back to the last village.
- How will I find the old man?
He will find you.
Don't worry.
He will find you.
Sit.
I know who you are.
This circle is a (target)
the point to which
they @@@
The eye here, all-seeing,
all penetrating.
He is protection
from the great evil one.
How has he come to you?
My dog.
He's taken over my wife
and my children
and somehow, he kills
anybody who tries to stop him.
Not all.
He has not killed you.
He tried.
You are among the blessed.
You have the special strenght
to resist the beast.
- The beast?
- (Textual) words.
- Where?
- In your Bible.
Read about the thousand years.
At the end of
the thousand years,
the beast can be brought back
by the evil of the earth,
brought back from the
deepest depths of Hell.
He is here now.
You know what
this thing is then?
Yes.
Then you must know
how to kill it.
The beast cannot be killed.
There must be a way.
I can't let him have
my wife and my children.
You could leave his presence
and be safe.
No.
I have to destroy it.
It can be locked away for
another 1000 years, but...
Perhaps, at the price
of your own soul.
Tell me how.
I wanted to be sure
I will give my great gift
to the right man.
It steals the souls
of those we love
and turns them
against what is right.
They no longer @@@
@@@
To look into his eye
is to see the netherworld.
Do not look into his eye
or you'll die too.
And tumble to the
depths of Hell forever.
He fears this sign
for is his undoing.
Hold this against the vision
of the netherworld,
against his eye,
and he will be consumed
in his own fire
and called back to his master.
I pick the place.
Mr. Barry?
- Just let me in, Scottie.
- Oh, sure thing, Mr. Barry.
Alright, I'm here.
Thank God you're here!
He's dead, isn't it?
Yes, he's dead.
- There you go.
- Ok, I got it.
Oh, Betty. What in the
world did you got there?
Look at them! I'm not
gonna leave 'em home.
- Oh, come on!
- May need some @@@ air.
I don't believe you, mother.
- Will you close it, sweetheart?
- Yeah, sure.
It's over, forever, isn't it?
Don't you worry, baby.
It is over.
It is over
and you're safe.
This is gonna be the
best vacation ever.
Come on, let's go!
Dad?
About what Bonnie said,
about it been over,
well, there were
10 pups in that litter.
Where you suppose
the other 9 are?
Come on.
