- Yeah, I know, I know.
- All right.
- But, uh, as far as tonight...
I don't know what you wanna do.
I had a few ideas. I was thinking,
you know, maybe just for the heat...
- I would give you a low blow,
follow it up with a bulldog.
- Just bring the cheap heat, bro.
- You guys should get the heat on us right away.
- <i>All right.</i>
Keep the heat on us, beat the shit
out of us. Boom, boom, boom, boom.
We'll come up,
we'll get on the ropes.
- You guys bring us both in the hard way.
- Okay.
Then we get up, double dropkick,
we powder out again.
All right.
So we're gonna really milk it tonight.
- We're gonna milk it.
Nice and slow, old-school, easy.

Don't work his leg, man.

- Leg or neck. What you got?
- Maybe make your comeback right off there.
- Bang off the ropes...
<i>then super kick and, uh, Ram Jam...</i>

Yeah? Okay.
- It's good to see you, Ram.
- Good to see you. Goddamn.
I haven't seen you in a while.
How you been?
Now, I'm telling you, it was one of
the historic matches in history.
It was 20,000 people.
Another million and a half sitting
at home watching it on pay-per-view.
We're slamming the piss
out of each other.
I mean, for God knows how long.
We're both gassing.
You ask any wrestling fan,
they've heard about that one.
- Million and a half. Shit.
- Oh, yeah, it was big.
And a rematch?
Hey. This could be history all over again.
Goddamn, look at you.
You are one smoking baby. Mmm.
Let me make an honest
woman out of you.
Hmm?
I mean, who knows?
I'm in pretty good shape right now.
You know, with a little luck,
this could be my ticket back on top.
- You never know who's in that crowd.
- Yeah. Yeah.
That would be a dream.
Oh, Jesus. You're bleeding.
- Oh!
- Yeah, I got cut tonight.
Oh!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's nothin'
- They say wrestling's fake, huh?
- Fake? I'll show you fake.
Look at this.
1986, Denver Coliseum.
Billy Bob Banjo hit me
with a two-by-four.
It had a loose nail in it,
split my bicep right the hell open.
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Look at that. I got a better one than that.
Take a look at this here.
1988, okay?
Orlando Civic Center.
Mr. Magnificent threw me
over the top ropes.
I landed on my shoulder
and cracked my clavicle right in half.
Oh, my God.
Does it hurt?
Well, it hurts when I breathe, but, I mean,
you know, you hear the roar of the crowd...
you just...
you motor through, you know?
"He was pierced
for our transgressions.
"He was crushed for our iniquities.
"The punishment that brought us
peace was upon him...
and by his wounds we were healed."
Hmm. What was that all about?
It's <i>The Passion of the Christ.</i>
You have the same hair.
- You never seen it?
- No.
Dude, you gotta!
It's... It's amazing.
- They throw everything at him...
whips, arrows, rocks.
- Hmm.
They beat the living fuck out of him
the whole two hours, and...
- he just takes it.
- Hmm.
Tough dude.
Sacrificial Ram.
<i>Next on the main stage

it just don't feel... right.
And that's why...
That's why I wanted
to talk to you, you know.
'Cause I don't want to be alone.
Randy.
You should be with your family now.
Don't you have a daughter?
Where's your daughter?
Uh, my daughter...
she don't like me very much.
<i>I don't believe it.
Everybody needs a father...</i>
and... trust me...
this kind of thing
brings people together.
Ah-
<i>You should call her.</i>
I should go back in.
You're gonna be okay, huh?
- I'll be okay.
- Okay.
Stephanie.
Hi, this is Stephanie.
Leave a message.
Ah...
Man.
Oh. Uh, is, uh, Stephanie home?
- Who can I say it is?
- Uh, tell her it's her father.
Hey. Stephanie.
- Where you goin'?
- What do you want?
Well, I just... I have to talk to you.
I can't really talk right now.
- I really need to talk to you.
- I have school.
- You're going to school?
- Yeah.
Well, that's great.
Listen. I had a heart attack...
and I just thought
I needed to tell you.
You are such an asshole.
What do you want from me?
<i>What do you want?</i>
I just been alone, and, uh...
you're my daughter, and I love you,
and I just... I just needed to see you.
That's bullshit.
You want me to take care of you.
- No.
- <i>Yes.</i>
Well, I'm not gonna do that.
'Cause where the fuck were you
when I needed you to take care of me?
You know, on all my birthdays...
<i>which you never even made one.</i>
<i>You probably don't even
know when it is.</i>
So, you know what? No. I don't care
if you had a heart attack. Fuck you!
- Oh! Ram.
- Hey.
- Didn't think I'd see you here.
- Why not?
- Hey.
- Hey.
I heard you collapsed
at the DiFusco show.
Ah, man, I just overheated
and blacked out. That's all.
- <i>Really?</i>
- Yeah, I was out of the hospital in less than an hour.
- <i>So, you're fine?</i>
- Brother, I'm good to go.
That's excellent!
I was just gonna cancel the minivan.
- What minivan?
- I rented one for Fanfest.
Yeah, m-me and the whole
gang's driving down.
Terry C., Caggiano, Fatback.
Oh, I'm so fucking psyched!
<i>Volpe gave me an assload offlyers.</i>
Yeah. It's gonna be epic.
<i>Volpe said the scout from
the show was gonna be there.</i>
- Uh...
- <i>Twenty years in the making.</i>
- It's gonna be something.
- Yeah. Come on. I got you set up down here.
- Hey, bro.

So, uh, yeah.
Should get a pretty good crowd today.
Oh. Great.
I'll, uh... I'll loosen up.
All right.

Good to see you. Wow.

<i>I like your T-shirts.</i>
- How much for an autograph?
- Ten dollars.

Okay. Ready, guys?

- I'm feeling good.
- A lot better.
- Good.
And I took your advice.
I went and saw my daughter.
Yeah? How did that go?
Uh, it didn't go very well.
She sort of ripped me a new asshole.
Oh. Oh.
Sorry to hear that.
Oh, hey.
What are you gonna do?
Oh, just...
Maybe if I went out
and did something special, you know?
- Bought her a present.
- That's a really great idea.
- Well...
- What's she into?
Hmm. Yeah, I don't really...
You know.
What kind of music does she like?
I really don't know.
Well, is she into something else,
like, well, cooking or books or something?
Oh.
- I don't know.
- Okay. Well...
you should get her clothes,
like some kind of clothes.
- All girls like that. Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Hey. I know the right place.
It's this kick-ass little vintage shop
in Elizabeth.
- Ah.
- I think it's on Elizabeth Avenue.
You should go on Saturday.
That's when they get all the best shit.
Hey, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

I don't think
I'm quite ready for that yet.

What do you want?
Well, I was wondering if I could
get some more work... something, uh...

All I got is weekends.
Yeah, well, that works.
Isn't that when you sit on

Uh-huh?
Does that make
a difference what she...
No.

Oh, wow. What about this?
Look at this.
Got an "S" on it.
- Um...
- That looks perfect, huh?
Well...
I mean, it's winter, so maybe you want
something warmer, like a peacoat.
You got a point there.
- If you know her size.
- Yeah, that's pretty cool.
I don't know, man.
I think that's pretty rock and roll.
- What do you think?
- I...
You should go with your gut, man.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

You know, you look so goddamn pretty
in the daytime.
Hey, have a beer with me?
Uh, I gotta get going.

<i>Well.</i>

- <i>Boy. Jameson.</i>
- So, how old?
- Nine.
Wow. Hmm.
Who would figure, huh?
Well, it's not something
I usually tell the customers.
It's not exactly...
It's not a turn-on.
Uh, hold on.
Wait a second.
I want you to give this
to your little guy. It's a...
<i>It's a Randy the Ram

I think so.
Well, I can see where

Oh, that's this condo thing

Go ahead. Open it.
The "S" stands for "Stephanie."
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
Do you like it?
It's, uh... It's shiny.
That's not really your present.
I got you something else.
Hold on.
This is your real present.

- Yeah. Well, it's wintertime...
and I want you to keep warm.
- Thank you.
- Hey, anything for you, sweetheart.
So what are you doing right now?
What am I doing?
You know, I thought maybe we could,
you know, stop by our old favorite place.
We have an old favorite place?
You'll recognize it when you see it.
Uh, now's not really
the best time. I...
I got some stuff I gotta do.
What kind of stuff?
Just stuff.
Come on.
I'm not gonna, like...
I'm not gonna take a bite
out of you or anything.
Just, you know,
hang out for a little while.
I haven't been here in ages.
You remember the fun house?
Right there.
Used to be the Monster Motel.
- Kinda.
- Oh, you loved it.
We used to go in there,
and they had this, uh, spooky-ass skeleton.
It would pop out of a coffin.
You'd get really scared
and cry and wanna run out.
And then... then you'd beg
to go back in again.
Oh. Always was a glutton
for punishment.
Yeah, you wouldn't go in
unless you could sit on my foot...
and wrap your arms around my leg.
And we'd walk all the way
through like that.
Ah, I don't even remember that.
I do.
I just want to tell you.
<i>I'm the one...</i>
who was supposed to
take care of everything.
I'm the one who was supposed to make
everything okay for everybody.
But it just didn't
work out like that.
And I left.
I left you.
You never did anything wrong.
You know?
I used to try to...
Huh! Forget about you.
I used to try to pretend that...
you didn't exist.
But I can't.
You're my girl.
<i>You're my little...
You're my little girl.</i>
<i>And now-</i>
I'm an old,
broken-down piece of meat.
And I'm alone.
<i>And I deserve to be all alone.</i>
I just don't want you to hate me.
Okay?
Hey.
Oh.
Oh, man, we can't go in there.
Come on.
Oh, God.
- Whoo, man. Wow.
- This must have been a ballroom or something.
Oh, look at this.
We can...
Hey, here we go.
- What is that?
- It's my bow to you.
Am I supposed to bow back?
I bow to you?
Ah.
One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.
You can lead.
You're not bad.
Well, thank you.
Hold on.
Wait.
Let me get the door.
Well, I hope that wasn't
too painful for you.
- No, it was okay.
- Yeah, well...
Okay, uh, bye.
Bye.
Hey, maybe we could
go out to dinner sometime.
- Dinner?
- You know, on Friday or something?
Whatever works for you.
Saturday would be better.
- Saturday?
- Yeah.
You got it.
Oh, wow.
Wow.
<i>Hey, you there. Hey.</i>
Come on. Open it.
I'll wait till later
when it's quiet.
Oh, come on.
I want to watch your face when you read it.
Thank you.
That's very sweet.
Hey, thank <i>you.</i>
I mean, come on, baby. You saved my ass.
What?
I can't... do this.
Can't do what?
This.
I thought we had
a little something going on here.
<i>No. W... Well... I... I think you're
awesome. I think that you're a great guy.</i>
So what's the problem?
You think that I'm, like,
this stripper, and I'm not.
I'm a mom.
I have responsibilities.
I have a son.
<i>Anyway, you don't want
that fuckin'luggage, so-</i>
What if I do?
I can't go there.
- <i>What about the other day?</i>
- It was a mistake.
It didn't feel like a mistake to me.
The club and the real world...
they don't mix.
I don't know. I'll tell you,
I think that's a lot of bullshit...
because I think
you still feel something.
You're a customer, okay? You're a fucking
customer. I don't go out with customers.
<i>You got it?</i>
Yeah, I got it.
<i>Hey, can I have some
tequila over here, please?</i>
<i>Sure.</i>
<i>I tell you what. Here.</i>

- I want a dance.
Stop it.
What's the matter?
You gonna refuse a paying customer?
- I want a goddamn dance, sweetheart.

<i>Yeah, he's standing outside.</i>
<i>No, I don't want to do that.</i>
<i>I've seen you get stressed out. I don't want you
to be stressed. Let me get this asshole out.</i>
- <i>Just don't, don't say anything.</i>

telling myself, " Maybe something happened.
Maybe he's stuck in traffic."
But, no! You just keep doing
the same shit to me over and over again!
I know, and I apologize.
Look, I apologize.
I got a lot of stuff
swimming around in my head...

- Calm down.
- You know what? I don't care.
I don't hate you.
I don't love you.
I don't even like you.
- And I was stupid to think that you could change.
- I can... I can change.

- Come on.
There is no more fixing this.
It's broke. Permanently.
And I'm okay with that.
It's better.

I just want to say...
to you all tonight...
I'm very grateful to be here.
A lot of people told me
that I'd never wrestle again.
And that's all I do.
You know, if you live hard,
and you play hard...
- and you burn the candle at both ends...
- <i>Love you, Ram!</i>
You pay the price for it.
You know, in this life
you can lose everything that you love...
and everything that loves you.
<i>Now I don't hear
as good as I used to...</i>
<i>and I forget stuff...</i>
and I ain't as pretty
as I used to be.
But goddamn it,
I'm still standing here, and I'm the Ram.
You know, as time goes by...
as time goes by, they say,
"He's washed up.
"He's finished.
He's a loser.
He's all through."
- But you know what?
- <i>Twenty more years!</i>
The only ones who are gonna tell me
when I'm through doing my thing...
is you people here.
You people here...
You people here are the ones...
who are worth bringing it for,
because you're my family.
<i>I love all of you.
Thank you so much!</i>
Great talk, Randy.
Thank you.
Yeah!
Pick it up, baby.
Take it easy! Ah!
- What are you doing? This is my move!
- Giving up?
Steal my move, Randy?
This is how you do it!
This is how you do it!
One, two, th... Hey! Who you pushing?
- Do not tell me what to do!
- You can't push me!
Don't tell me!
<i>U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!</i>

Bring it, Bob!

Hey, you okay, ref?
Now I'm gonna take you out, baby!
U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!
Let's take it home.
Ram? Are you all right?
You okay, Ram?
Ram?
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>
<i>Pin me!
Come on, Ram. Pin me!</i>
<i>We gave 'em enough.</i>

Take it home.
