Y o. I'm fixed to tell you
how it is in the 'hood.
See, 'cause in the 'hood,
everybody's a target.
It ain't Like that, I'm gonna tell you
the real deal what goes on.
See, in the 'hood,
most of us won't reach the age of 21,
¶ Happy birthday, homie...
For me?
- Yeah,
¶ Happy birthday, homeboy...
For me?
- Yeah, Make a wish,
.
No, Lord. No, Lord.
Not my baby.
I know you didn't do me wrong.
Oh, my junior.
I nursed him with these, Lord.
Oh, not my baby.
- Yo, Yo.
Yo, Yo, Yo.
This ain't your baby,
This ain't your baby.
Huh?
Ain't that some shit?
I'm gonna tell you
what it's really like livin' in the 'hood.
I moved back into my father's house after
livin' with my mom for most of my life.
Tray.
I don't want you hangin' out in the streets.
I want you to finish school
'cause without an education,
the only kind of work you're gonna get
is sellin' drugs, pimpin' women,
or workin' security for Eddie Murphy.
Now, I've done all I can.
I got my education,
I worked two jobs to support you.
But I can't teach you how to be a man.
Only your father can do that.
Now give me a kiss and be a good boy,
I Love you, Tray,
- I Love you too, Mom,
So will I see you again?
- Sorry, baby.
You know there ain't no
positive black females in these movies.
Sorry.
My father tried his best to give me advice.
Problem was, he was only
a couple of years older than me.
Problem was, he was only
a couple of years older than me.
Fool. I told you,
I don't want no damn Watchtower.
Hey. What's up, nigga?
- What's up, Pops?
Yo. How are you doin', man?
How's it goin'?
Oh, man,
- Look at you, nigga, It's gonna be on,
Look at you, You got big, man,
- You know what I'm sayin'.
Last time I seen you,
you was this tall.
You didn't get on the amusement rides,
We had to go to Kiddie Land.
All good, Know what I'm sayin'?
I was about to eat breakfast, Hungry?
No, I'm full, I had some Red Hots,
- Is that right? Cool.
Hey, man, Come on in, Please allow me,
You a guest in my house, man.
Make yourself at home.
Are those Girbauds?
Shit, I'm gonna be sportin' them, man.
It's good to have you up in here too.
I'm gonna finish gettin' my swellin'
on right, so have a seat, man.
Hey. Make sure your ass is on that plastic.
So we're not bumpin' heads, if you gonna
be stayin', you have to follow some rules.
No smokin' my shit,
Don't Let me catch you drinkin' my shit.
And if you bring
any of them hos up in here,
make sure I fuck 'em first.
And you're gonna have some chores,
Chores?
- That's right, This ain't no free ride.
Keep track of my Matchbox cars,
organize the Sega Genesis cartridges.
Do my homework,
since you wanna be a such a smart-ass.
And at nighttime,
I want you to cut the hair on my balls.
Hey, hold up,
Can I ask you a question, Pop?
What you gonna be doin'?
Hey. Look, nigga.
I ain't got to do nothin',
My momma take care of me.
Look, I know you think
I'm bein' hard on you,
but I guess I'm tryin'
to teach you some responsibility.
You right, Pop.
Hey, could you Line me up in the back?
Nigger, that's gonna run you about $1 3,
$1 3? Oh, come on, The Spanish dude
down the block only charges six.
Take your ass to him
and Let him fuck your head up.
Nah, I'll Let you cut me up,
Let me ask you a question,
- What's up?
Are you still a virgin?
- Of course.
There was this one dude who rubbed up
against my butt one time, but I didn't Like it.
I'm talkin' about girls, man.
Oh, girls, Come on, Pops,
Now, you know I be gettin' mine,
You gettin' it or you gettin' it?
- I'm gettin' it,
I ain't told you about that little honey dip?
- What honey?
I met the finest little brown-skinned cutie
down at the corner market.
She had big breasts and big legs,
Her ass was pow.
Ghetto booty,
- Oh, yeah.
So I knew she Liked me
'cause we Locked eyes.
So I start to get into my mac daddy
Denzel mode, you know, Yeah.
I fixed my eyebrows,
made sure they were straight.
Fixed my hair,
made sure it was slick and greasy,
Makin' sure my breath wasn't stinkin', , ,
- Get to the damn fuckin' part.
OK, So anyway, , .
I went over her house one Sunday mornin'.
Her mom had just gone to church.
And we had the place all to ourselves.
So, you know, we got
to kissin', lickin', slobbin'.
You know, doin' the wild thing.
When we got up there,
it was like heaven.
Better than my wildest fantasies.
Apparently, her mom
must have forgot her purse or somethin',
'cause she came back home.
I guess she could smell the sex in the air.
I got a surprise for you.
And that's when things really got freaky.
Before I knew it, the door burst open
and there was her momma.
Oh.
Hold him down, baby,
Let Momma have him.
I grabbed my things and got out of there.
Yeah,
I sure do hope you get her number,
- The girl?
Hell, no, Her momma, She the freak,
Don't go up too high in the back,
- Don't worry.
You all done, There we go.
I got somethin' for you to make
the girls think you're smellin' good.
All hooked up, partner,
Give me my $1 3,
.
Give it up.
This is a jack move, fool.
Just don't shoot.
Come back here with my truck.
Give me that truck back.
Man, you got any spare change?
Sorry, bro, I'm all out, man.
Man, I got these cheeseburgers, man,
I don't want any cheeseburgers,
- Please, man,
I'll suck your dick,
- Ew.
Get outta here, man.
Get outta here.
It hurt me to wake up
and see my beautiful black people suffer.
Victimized by the oppressive
harsh realities of the 'hood.
I guess, even though we were free,
we were still slaves in the mind.
Message.
Luckily, I wasn 't alone here in the 'hood.
My cousin Loc Dog
lived right across the street.
Loc Dog was America 's worst nightmare.
Raised in a house with three generations...
of hopelessness, poverty and profanity.
.
Loc Dog, turn that
Loud-ass motherfuckin' music down.
You wakin' up the babies, motherfucker.
This still my house, motherfucker.
Who the fuck is that on my porch?
Hey, Miss Dog,

Yes, ma'am, How are you?
Oh, my old stinky ass is fine.
Except for my arthritis in my trigger finger,
But I can still stick and move,

That beatin' the police give me
didn't slow me down a bit.
Come on, motherfucker,
Give me your best shot.
Come on, Grandma,
I don't wanna do nothin' Like that,
Come on, nigga,
- Come on, Grandma, I don't wanna.
Damn, them fake teeth are hard.
Bye-bye.
You still hit Like a bitch, motherfucker.
Loc Dog was gonna teach me to survive
in the 'hood, even if it killed me.
.
Tray, is that you?
You better start announcin' yourself

Or should I wear this Uzi, , ,
with my Low tops?
I'll just wear these then.
Tray, scoot over, Rumor has it your

Yeah, man, Mom says
it's time for me to become a man.
Nigger, my mom said the same shit,
Sweatin' me, nigga.
Yeah, man,
I don't care, though.
I told her,
I don't wanna be on welfare my whole Life.
For real, I got bigger and better plans.
Figured I'd get me a job at the post office,
maybe at a bank,
That's all good, man,
- Work hard, Work my way up to manager,
We need more black people Like this,
- Learn the system.
Then I'll rob that motherfucker blind.
Break all yourselves.
Hold up,
Whatever happened to your pops anyway?
That old mark-ass nigga
ran out on us Like a little biznitch.
You know, it's, , .
It was kinda tough, , .
Growin' up in the 'hood without a, , ,
without a positive
male role model to Look up to.
Message.

But now, he's just plain confused.
Preach, What up, nigga?

Psst,
Dashiki was far more
sexually experienced than I was.
She taught me all about foreplay.
Until then,
I ain't never done foreplay before.
But then again, who needs foreplay
when you're jackin' off?
¶ Treat you like you're nothing...
¶ When you're worth more than gold...
¶ Girl, to me, you're like a diamond...
¶ I love the way you shine.
Are you thirsty?
¶ I'll put a string of
pearls right in your hand...
¶ Make love on a beach of jet-black sand...
¶ Outside in the rain...
¶ We can do it all night...
¶ I'll touch all the places he would not...
¶ And some you never knew
would get you hot...
¶ Nothing is forbidden when we touch.
Nuh-uh, fool,
That's the baby's Lunch,
¶ I wanna do
all of the things your man won't do...
¶ I'll do them for you...
¶ Oh, baby, I wanna do...
¶ All of the things your man won't do...
¶ Every little thing...
¶ I'll do them for you...
¶ I'll take you out
on a night cruise on a yacht...
¶ Just can't lose
'cause we've got a lot to look forward to...
¶ One, two, what you gonna do?
¶ What good is a diamond nobody can see?
¶ I hear he got you all locked down,
¶ But I got the master key...

¶ Tempo slow, lights down low.
Damn, girl.
You're so tight.
Wrong hole, fool.
My bad.
I couldn't believe this was happenin' to me.
I was losin' my virginity
to the woman of my dreams.
Talk dirty to me,

Ashtray, wake up,
What's up, baby?
- I need to tell you somethin'.
What's up?
I'm pregnant,
- Already? Are you sure?
I got seven kids,
I think I know what I'm talkin' about.
Dashiki, I'm not ready
to be no father right now.
You man enough to come up in me, but
not enough to take care of what comes out,
get my nails done, get my hair done,
pay my rent and get me a new car?
You know what?
You ain't nothin' but a little boy.
It ain't all about the size of the boat,
It's the motion in the ocean.
That's not what I'm talkin' about.
As a matter of fact, get out.
Get out of my bed. Get out of my house.
Get out. And take your shit with you,
Why you trippin'?

I don't wanna talk to you.

What else is new?
What else is new? It's mine,

the 'hood niggas out of Dashiki,
...
Damn five-o,

You there. Get out of the truck
and put your hands in the air.
Stand on one leg.
With the tip of your finger,

Now in a circular motion,
rub your stomach and pat your head...
while saying,
'Rubber baby buggy bumper. '
Rubber baby buggy bumper,
Strike a pose. Now Vogue.

Now walk slowly toward the car.
We didn't even do nothin'.

And most of all,
I hate that black ass, Wesley Snipes.
Move it.
Come on,

What's up, young blood?
- What's up?
Swine, my brother?
No, thanks,
- Now Let me tell you somethin'.
If you hit a man,
in time, his wounds will heal.
And if you steal from a man,
you can replace what you steal.
And always cross in the green,
never in between.
Because the honorable
Elijah Mohammad Ali...
floats Like a butterfly and stings Like a bee.
Thinkin' about
another minute with Farra-convict...
made me never want
to do time in the joint again.
Boy, am I happy to see you, man,
- Always remember, my brother,

But I don't know why.
Well, you know.
I can understand how a pretty girl Like
yourself might make a man a little sick.
I mean nervous.
Yeah, well, it takes a really special
kind of man to be with me,
...
You know?
- Yeah, well, Let me go find him.
Damn, girl,
you need to slow down with that.
You ain't my daddy
and you ain't payin' any of my bills.
Mind your business,

I guess it'd be all right.
Baby, you really Love me.

It ain't gonna hurt you.
It's just that, when I drink,
sometimes I get a little crazy.
And that's what l want.
I don't want you to think
I'm a freak or nothin' Like that.
I usually don't even go home with guys

But I just feel so comfortable with you.
Hey, that's good, girl.
Whenever you with me, I want you

You are so nasty,

Man, Look, , .
Let me give you the same advice
my father gave me, all right?
Give up hope, Look at me,
Dreams are for suckers.
Ain't no future for you,
And don't think about gettin' no job, Tray,
'Cause the black man
ain't got no place in the workforce.
So hold up, Let me get this straight,
What you're tryin' to say is...
don't get caught in the white man's
self-perpetuatin' unemployment...
and tryin' to survive on welfare checks?
Wrong. Ain't nothin' wrong with
welfare checks, It's free money.
Our family survived six generations on it,
Thanks, You always know what to say,
- Thought you knew, boy.
My boy Tray gettin' himself some sex.
Gettin' Locked up in the city ain't the same.

Really.
I actually think we're gonna be all right,
Why don't you come with us?

Take a road trip in a mail truck?
That's the stupidest idea I heard.
Well, anyway, you just be careful.
Come on now, baby,
you talkin' to Loc Dog.
You know I'm gonna be all right.
Shoot.
Hey, Tray, , .
Never forget, man.
Either they don't know,

I'm sorry, man.
