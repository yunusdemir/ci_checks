They are late.
Inside, we're late!
Keep them busy!
Sign!
Here 0-19 our vehicle is attacked!
Submit Support!
Submit Support!
I understand, we're coming.
This is crazy, Thomas!
Come on!
Come on, Vince!
Vince!
Skip!
Shit!
Let's go!
Look at.
0-19, receive a warning.
You have insects on the tail. We're
going to attack the truck now.
Inside, you have company!
Come on, go!
Shoot.
Shoot!
Damn it!
Shit!
Thomas, you're left
alone, do not die!
Good luck!
We have to move on!
Movement!
Throw me a bag!
Shoot!
Back.
Vince?
We're ready!
Come here!
Come on, move on!
U zaklon!
Forward! Movement!
We've lost the last five!
Stop the train!
Newt!
Let's go!
Minho?
Minho, do you hear me?
That!
This one.
Shit!
It will be very close.
We're getting bastards.
We are them!
We are them!
<i>Leave the vehicle with your arms raised.</i>
Let's go, people.
Stop! Do not move!
I said do not move, asshole!
Whatever you say.
U zaklon!
I would not be in your place.
Hello, Tavo.
I'm glad to see
you, get in touch.
Hi.
Newt, how's it progressing?
Do not hurry me.
Newt, come on!
I'm almost done.
Newt go!
Where are they?
-I do not know.
There are too many of them!
Guys, here we are!
Keep upgrading!
Drop down!
It can!
- We're ready!
Let's go upstairs.
Vince, come here!
Now, Vince!
It!
Let's go home, darling.
<b> LABIRINT: HUMAN RIGHTS </ b></b>
Larch!
Are you fine?
-Yes, we're fine.
Thank God!
All is well.
Now you're safe. Just hold it.
- I need a metal cutter.
Not here.
Get ready!
Listen up.
I know that hell is gone.
I wish I could say that
our problems are over,
but we are not done yet.
ZLOPAK are still there, they will not give up.
Because you have something you want.
They got you because you're immune
to the plague that
destroys the human race.
They think it's worth
sacrificing for finding a cure.
Well, I do not think so.
For two days, when we are
getting these sailplanes ready
we're leaving here.
We will go to a place where
YOU will not find YOU.
Where you can start again.
A place you can call your home.
Can I help you?
Looks good.
How are you feeling?
Great.
Just asking.
I know, I know, you just ask.
Everyone just wonders.
Do not worry when something
changes, you'll find out first.
Drink this.
It took you a long
time to save us.
It's good to see you
again, my friend.
What happened?
We have resisted.
We tried to fight.
You found us lucky enough.
They've moved us all the time.
There seems to be something big.
Do you have any idea where they went?
Everything I know is...
... they always talked about the city.
I thought there were no more cities?
Because they no longer exist.
Not at all.
Wait, what about Minh?
Why was not he on the train?
Sorry, Thomas.
He was.
We have forty-five maybe fifty children.
We are still waiting for the final list.
Pilot saw them well, I
think they were them.
They must be.
What about the aircraft?
We've been tracking it for a few miles,
until the tracking
device has been fixed.
C 22.
We search the area, but they
probably left long ago.
No, he will not go anywhere.
They did not get what they came from.
Here... that's it.
A few hundred miles.
Based on the railroad and what Iris
told us, it's their destination
There will take Minho there.
We're going to take
everyone we can fight.
We follow the road when we can...
We're back in a week.
Week?
It took us six
months to come here.
Now we have more than 100 children.
We can not stay here forever,
especially after our surgery.
You want to wander to the random point on the
map. You do not even know what's up there?
I know.
It's been a few years, but...
... I was there.
The last city.
So they called it.
The base of their operations.
If that city still exists,
this is the last place
you want to go.
It's a lion's jacket.
It's not something that we have not already done.
Yes, after several months of planning.
With reliable information.
Surprise element.
We have nothing now.
I have been thinking.
When we last went unprepared, I lost
everything. Do you remember that?
I know it's Minho.
But you can not ask me to risk
all these kids for a man.
I will not.
<i>Remove them!</i>
<i>There's an airplane.</i>
<i>The most common sector.</i>
Shit! Turn off the lights!
-Move!
They are approaching.
You're right.
We can not stay here.
What do you mean, where are you going?
Newt...
Do not be crazy.
I'm going with you.
No, not this time.
Even if we find Minho there is no
guarantee that we will come back.
Then you need all the help
you can get, do not you?
We started together.
I think we should
end up together.
Good.
Let's get them back.
Not?
Hey!
Hey!
Hang on...?
Hey, wait!
<i>Status?</i>
<i>I'm restarting the system.</i>
No no!
It's not as effective as a
maze, but it seems to work.
This is promising.
But we need a larger sample.
<i>Good.</i>
<i>Set.</i>
Not!

Want to get in there?
I do not want to be negative, but to
be a Patient, I would be right there.
I do not think we have a choice.
Well, I'll shoot the shotgun.
Let's go.
Just calm and slow.
It is OK.
That's just one.
Quiet pass by.
We'll be fine.
Quietly.
Quietly
Please!
Please.
Help me!
Please.
Tavo, we have to go!
Come on, Tavo, go!
Come on!
Come on, Tavo, get rid of it!
-I am trying!
Go!
Hold on!
Watch out!
Are you fine?
My arm.
My arm.
Cover your eyes, Tavo.
Are you okay, man?
- Yes, I'm fine.
By the way, go to the other side.
Newt, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.
By the way, are you okay?
Shit!
By the way, now we have to go!
Watch out!
Stop!
Now, Tavo!
Go!
I shot him.
-Thank you.
Movement!
Let's go!
Beware!
Tavo, do you have it?
This way, this way!
Another way!
I do not have ammunition!
Shit!
Come!
Come on, Jorge!
Go!
Impressed.
You managed to survive one day.
Are you OK?
-That.
I'm sorry... I did not
want to bring you in.
I think that's what she is trying to say.
Thank you for saving us.
You're welcome.
But do not be hoping, that control point,
was the last line of defense of the city.
If she is pregnant,
it's probably the city.
Unless they discovered another way
to prevent them from entering.
Ridiculous.
I spent three years
behind the walls trying
Escape, and now I'm trying
to get in there again.
Yeah, very funny.
Jorge, how are we going to get in?
Do not look at me.
These walls are new.
I think that's the GREAT
answer to everything.
We will not find a way
to get out of here.
Let's go!
Do you think she's there?
I think we'll find out.
You know she's going to be there?
Sorry.
Are you ready?
All will be well.
We started to lose confidence.
When you closed the walls you convinced us
that this would be just a temporary measure.
Why did you completely
block entry?
Because things change,
not the best.
The infection rate has increased by 300%!
Fortunately,
we may be on the verge of discovery.
This is subject A-7.
He spent about three
years in the labyrinth.
Anti-bodies produced as a
result of the reaction
are the strongest we've ever seen.
We're producing a new serum
while I'm talking to you.
And with your support, we want
to start experiments on people.
This is really interesting.
But we've already tried it
Honestly, we all started to ask...
- Would ours
resources were better
used somewhere else.
What does it imply?
-Secure areas.
Protected areas like the
place where we are now.
We can save the largest
number of people.
How much?
A thousand?
Two thousand?
Assuming that your protected
areas will remain protected.
We know he will not.
Infected is more than
healthy in a 3: 1 ratio.
All you will do is
postpone inevitably.
Has any of you ever lost
someone for a virus?
Niece.
Anu.
I'm sorry we could not help her.
But imagine if we could
live with the virus.
Survive him.
Imagine we can say Ani
to give her a chance
to live a normal life.
We've never been close to
finding a drug like now.
We sacrificed a
lot to come here.
Please,
Do not make these
sacrifices in vain.
Well done.
It's hard to convince them
sometimes, but you've succeeded.
"Delay of Inevitable."
Thomas spoke the same thing about us.
Do you think about him?
I can help with these memories.
There's no reason to keep them.
It's a simple procedure.
There is a reason.
I want to remember.
If we find a cure.
That will be the only reason why
all this was worth the effort.
I hope you are right.
This place looks like hell.
Stay close.
We are the voice of those without a voice!
They're hiding behind the walls!
They think they can keep the cure for themselves!
As they watch us rush like rats!
But there are more than us!
I say we will win
what belongs to us!
We will win!
Call Janson.
<i>DRINKS FOR THE SUPERVISION
OF THE LETTER OF THE LEADER</i>
Let us in there!
That's it, so we'll get in!
Let us in there!
On the wall!
Let us in there!
Thomas!
That's not what we are looking for!
All these people are trying to enter! You mean
how can you find something that they are not?
I came here, I will
not come back now!
What did we get into?
Get away from the road!
Thomas, I do not feel good.
You were right, Mr. Dron noticed
him in front of the wall.
Prepare your weapon.
We have to go now, look!
Movement!
Thomas, let's go!
Come on!
Let's get out!
Do not stop!
Keep running!
Come on, come on! Come on!
Come on!
Newt!
Get your hands off me!
Not! Brenda!
Brenda! Brenda!
Go, go, go!
Send patrol.
Do not come back until they find it.
Get out!
Where are they?
Where is she, son of a bitch?
Shit!
Guys, guys, calm down.
I'm here!
Good good.
I'm here!
Brenda.
Everyone calms down.
We're all in the same team.
What does that mean ?
Who the hell are you?
Hello, Yellow-haired.
Gally?
Jebate.
No, wait!
Hang on!
Stop it, everything's fine.
Stop, Tommy, stop it.
He killed Chuck. - Yeah.
I remember, and I was there.
I also remember he was
totally outspoken and crazy.
Just calm down.
Calm down.
I think I deserved it.
Is there any more?
Fray? Newt?
Do you know him?
He was an old friend.
How?
How is that possible?
We watched you die.
No, you left me to die.
If we did not find you
now it would be dead.
What the hell are you doing here?
Minho
keep it here.
We're looking for the entrance.
I can help you with that.
Follow me.
- I will not go anywhere with you.
However you like.
But I can put you behind the wall.
After the labyrinth was picked by
a group that went to the city.
They realized I was
immune and covered me.
Then they brought me
here, to Lawrence.
This group is in war with ZLOPAK
since they took control of the city.
But ZLOPAK will not be able to
hide behind these walls forever.
The day will come when he
will pay for his actions.
Hear...
There are not many visitors.
Well, let me talk, okay?
And try not to stare at him.
I think Lais took my nose.
I think Lais took my nose.
I mean, I think I stole my nose.
I think..
Gally.
I'm glad you came back.
Jasper told me
what had happened.
It was a massacre.
We can not do anything
against that weapon.
No, but I can only hunt the
nestling nest for a while...
... before being shot.
Who are these people?
And why are they here?
We need to get in GOOGLE.
Gally said he could bring us in.
Well, he should know he does not
give promises he can not hold.
In addition, the walls are
just part of your problem.
Going to DELETE is impossible.
Maybe there is a way now.
But it will not fire without Thomas.
And,..
Do you know what I am?
Thomas.
I'm a businessman.
Which means I do not
take unnecessary risk.
Why am I supposed to trust you?
Because I can help you.
If you can put me behind the wall
I can get you what you need.
What do you think I need?
-Time.
Every moment.
Is that what I need?
ZLOPAK is what we both want.
I'll tell you what...
Two of you can go.
Others stay here with me.
There is little guarantee
to make sure you go back.
Do we have an agreement?
Gally, show them the way.
Be careful, Thomas.
Gally, take care of these two.
-Alright.
Jesus!
Great today.
Stay with me.
It's awaiting us a long way.
We're ready.
Shai?
Miss Teresa?
How are you feeling?
-Not bad.
Will I be better than that?
We hope.
Do you remember the
story you told me?
About the house where you grew up.
I do not remember.
House near the lake.
It burns. - I know.
So.
It's fine.
You are so brave.
This is unbelievable.
When can you give it to the infected?
You have a lot of compassion for
someone who shot the crowd.
I was trying to do my job.
I had a chance.
And missed, obviously.
Patrol has never found the body.
Thomas is still there
What about her?
Do you know that?
Not.
He must not find out.
She has to stay focused.
Raise the level of
security in the city.
I'm counting on you to
solve this, Janson.
<i>Red Zone,</i>
<i>leave the station
within 5 minutes.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
This is a lot different
from the desolation.
<i>The police watch
begins in 15 minutes.</i>
<i>Go home neatly and do not forget,
this is for your safety, thank you.</i>
Yes, we better get off the street.
I know it's hard,
but act like you've
already seen such a city.
They certainly raised
the level of security.
I think you have something with that.
Let's get outta here.
Newt, get up.
I can.
It's here.
If ZLOOPAK has Minhoa,
there they hold it.
Lawrence has been trying to
find a way to go for years.
The place is a lot of soldiers.
They have surveillance cameras everywhere.
Scanners on each floor.
Sounds like a fortress.
I thought you knew how to get in?
Maybe.
Maybe? What do you mean "maybe"?
Look at.
I said I have a way to enter.
I did not say you liked it.
No, there must be another way.
For example? See the building,
she's the only way to get in.
Do you think it will help us?
- I do not intend to ask permission.
Did I miss something? That's the
girl who's been releasing us, right?
The same junk?
-I like it.
What is happening?
You're scared that your
former victim will get hurt
This was never just about Minhou?
Is it? -What are you talking about? Teresa.
She's the only reason Minho is caught.
Now finally
we have a chance to get it back, and
you do not want her to do it for her?
Because you still care about her.
Admit it!
Newt...
-Do not lie!
Do not lie!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I do not think I can
hide this anymore.
Why did not you tell me?
I did not think that
would change anything.
I know you put me in this
labyrinth for some reason.
Clean so they can know the difference
between immune like you and me.
Do you know we can still fix the thing?
- No, we can not.
If we could.
Do not worry about me.
This is about Minho. We need us.
So if there's any chance we can save
him, to get him out, we have to do it.
No matter the price
I know.
Wake him up.
<i>OWNERSHIP OF OWNERSHIP</i>
Minho
Do you hear me?
Here is a girl
Her name is Cheyenne.
He's been charged for three weeks.
Ali Minho,
you'll save her!
You can save a lot of people.
Everything we do here...
Thrives!
Do you understand that?
That is why it is very important.
I just wanted you to know that.
Teresa.
Minho?
Minho?
You're a traitor!
We trust you!
Let her go!
Get away from me!
Get away from me!
I'll kill you, traitors!
I'll kill you all!
Miss Teresa, they need you in a
medical lab. It looks serious.
I'm sorry, Teresa.
It's not your fault.
You did everything you could.
Let someone help me, please!
Can you help me, please?
It's all OK with me!
<i>This is a warning, the police watch has
started. Everyone caught will be arrested</i>
Thomas?
Thomas.
Hi, Teresa.
It should not be here.
If Janson finds out...
- I will not stay.
I just...
I had to see you.
Ask you something.
Do you find out about
the done thing?
Sometimes.
I did what I thought was right.
I would again.
Good.
You're stressful, as
far as I can see.
Nice, right?
That.
It's a beautiful city.
Walls.
The incredible ability of people
when their survival is concerned.
Push them enough and there
is nothing I can do.
There is no line
that will not cross.
We have a small stoppage.
It's not something we're not accustomed to.
Not this time.
The virus is transmitted by air.
It's inside the walls.
That was our last chance.
Anyone who has not been infected
will be within a month.
Good.
We can do it.
We must evacuate important people and
establish a new safe area in the north.
In this building we have 28 more
immune, we can find them more.
She would think so.
You caught each of them and brought
it until there was none left.
Despite everything
we did to them,
everything we exhibited them,...
At least we gave them
tools to survive.
We could succeed
where we did not.
You tell me to give up?
After all...
It's not about
giving up, Jansson.
You need to know when you're defeated.
Gally?
Thus,
we will ask you a few questions.
You will tell us exactly
what we need to know.
We'll start easily.
Where's Minho?
Do not think seriously...
Do not look at it,
Why are you watching him?
Look at me.
It will not help you.
We know you hold Minho in the building.
Where exactly?
He's in custody with others.
Sub-level 3.
How many others?
Twenty-eight.
It can pass.
No, you do not understand.
Entry to this level is forbidden.
You can not access without print.
-You are coming with us.
I do not know...
We do not need them.
Is it?
Not all.
We just need her finger.
- Cool, Gally.
Are you sick? I bet he worked things up
Minhou. - This is not our plan. Cool.
Nothing will change that.
Do what you do
want. Anyway, you will not be
able to go through the door.
Sensors will detect you and...
- We know, identify.
Ownership of ZLOPAK.
You will also help us with that.
Try to relax.
It will snap.
Just finish it.
She enjoys it.
- You're probably right.
Here, see if you do it.
-Thank you. - Thank you, Newt.
Better go, old man.
You have a long way ahead of you.
Are you sure I can not
answer you from this?
This is your last chance.
I did not mean to get
you out of the battle.
I did not think you were looking for a battle.
I can not stop thinking that when you
come out I will never see you again.
Since when do we risk strangers?
And I was a stranger.
Do not leave us stranded.
- I will not.
Never.
Looks good.
Hi.
How did you get her serum?
What are you talking about?
Brenda.
I did not think she
would still be alive.
When was the last time
he was on treatment?
Right hand?
Last time we saw you.
That was a few months ago?
Thomas, that's not possible.
She had to be transformed so far.
No chance to...
-Enough!
You do not trust me?
Do you expect this?
You made your decision.
Is everything all right?
That.
Were done.
Nice try.
Are you in love with her?
I do not know.
Be careful.
You have a problem when you
have to give up people.
And then when you need it.
You can not save all, Thomas.
I can try it.
Do not stop.
<i>ACCESSED ACCESS</i>
Come on, go!
Wait, wait.
I can access the system here.
Stay there.
- Give me a radio gear.
Tavo, we're in. How's it going?
Yes, yes, I'm going to the goal.
Pass my greetings to Minhou.
Hold on, buddy.
This one.
Inside, how's it going?
I'm working on it.
Alright. Just make
sure you do your part.
Do not worry, you know I'll be there.
Let's go!
We have a signal.
Gally succeeded.
We entered the system.
Good.
Give me everything.
I want full control.
This is weird. System triangles.
I'll go check it out.
Get back! Quickly!
Let's go!
Come!
All right, boys, let's go.
Come. Newt, go to another room.
You're fine. Hurry.
Safe?
How do I get in?
You can not.
Come.
Boys,
this may be a while.
Shit!
Mino is not here.
Where is he?
Could not wait until morning?
You realize it could kill him.
Do so suddenly? -I have orders.
Janson wants everything.
<i>COMPLAINT FOR COMPLETE CLOSER</i>
Someone took him
to a medical lab.
Thomas, that's on the other
side of the building.
Take me to him now.
- I'll go with you.
Newt, you will not. Stay here and
wait for Gally to bring the serum.
You can not do it yourself.
Mino is in the first place, right?
Just go, spend time!
I'll bring the serum,
later we'll meet you.
All right, let's go.
Hey, Yellow-haired,...
...good luck!
There.
Come on, come on.
Wait.
Work late.
That's what I like about you, Teresa.
No matter how bad
things are, you...
You never give up.
At these moments...
... you need a friend
you can count on.
I'll remember that.
There is one thing
you need to know.
From friend to friend.
Thomas is here.
Our drones shot off the wall.
Ava did not want you to know,
but there is a possibility that
will try to communicate
with you If it does...
And...
I'd like to think I'll be
the first to call you.
You want to kill him?
Will this be a problem?
This is my floor.
Thomas, you have to listen to me.
Getting this serum
will not save Newta.
Maybe he's got some time, but... - Hey, hey.
He's trying to manipulate your thoughts.
Thomas, listen!
You know what's going on.
People die, the world is dying.
Something in your blood I do not understand.
Open.
Let me make tests.
I promise to protect you. - Really?
How did you protect Minho?
-What are you doing?
How much will it take? How many people
will be kidnapped, tortured and killed?
When will it stop? - When we find a cure.
There is no cure!
Do not waste time, Teresa.
He decided long ago.
Put down your weapons, boy!
Back off!
Tell them to withdraw!
Tell them to withdraw!
Come on, Thomas.
That is me.
I know you for a long time.
You will not shoot her.
You mean?
Good.
Come on then.
Shoot her.
Prove that I'm wrong.
Shoot her!
Move away!
I hope you have a convincing explanation.
-You
I give you a favor. The doors are
closed, they will not be able to leave.
Janson, I need to live them.
Come on!
<i>Third floor, right now!</i>
We have to get out of here, right away.
Stay close to me and each other.
You. Protect this with your life.
Do you understand?
Alright.
Let's go!
Close the building.
Send it all to the 20th floor!
Somebody shut up
those damn sirens!
Quickly!
Quickly!
Stop!
Come on, go!
Come on! Get down!
Inside where are you?
We are here!
Let's go!
-Quickly!
On the back and front!
Let's go!
Hey, where's Thomas?
- I had it with you.
Wait, stay here with the kids.
Just wait here.
I'll find him.
Just wait, okay?
We will not go anywhere.
Any?
They're not here, sir.
-There are somewhere, find them.
You two there, stay behind me.
Let's go!
We understand!

-Yes sir.
Shit!
Do you have an idea?
Maybe.
All right, we can do that.
Just take the swing.
A little bit more!
Are you sure?
- Not really.
Good comfort.
Yes, very inspirational.
Let's go!
-Shit!
Let's go!
Thomas!
-Shit!
What are you OK?
-That
You three, do not bother!
You must be joking!
Slowly.
You're not even thinking about it!
Leap on the ground and raise your hands!
Son of a bitch!
Gally?
Minho.
You're really crazy.
I'll explain later
<i>BECAUSE, ALL EMPLOYERS...</i>
Cover them!
Declare a police watch, no one
will leave until they are
caught.-It's done, sir.
Follow the bus. Our troops are persecuting them.
Which bus?
Shit!
Hold on!
Shit!
Get out of the car!
Do not bother.
It's great for you.
Get away from the car!
I said: Get off the car!
Raise your hands to the air!
Drop your weapon!
Let's go.
Movement! Movement!
Let's go!
Hold on for something!
Let's go! -Opkolite bus!
Do not shoot!
Hold on!
Sorry.
Shit!
Hold on for something!
<i>EXTRAORDINARY</i>
All right, all out!
Shut up!
They have not been able to escape yet.
Well, they're definitely angry.
How far are tunnels?
Some 12 streets out of here.
We can succeed.
Newt, how do you feel?
Horrible.
But it's good to see you.
When has this been the case?
It'll be fine.
We just need to get to Brenda.
She has serum.
Let's go.
Come on, Newt. We have to take you, my friend.
Let's go. -Slowly.
You are OK?
-That.
Why do you help us, Gally?
I spotted you with a spear.
Yes, no one is perfect, man.
Lawrence!
Wait, wait!
Where are everyone?
Wait here, guys.
Thomas!
Lawrence!
It all disappeared.
Do not be afraid.
Maybe I'm not nice.
But we all know who
the enemies are!
They are hiding behind these walls!
Have a name!
For people like us.
They call us Patients!
But I'm saying they're the monsters.
They started this war,
but tonight...
we will end it.
Follow me.
Follow me and we will show them people's faces
which they decided to forget!
Follow me and the city will be yours!
Let's go!
Let's go!
<i>Control Center, do you see this?</i>
<i>What do we do?
-Shit!</i>
Prepare the first and
second fire balls!
<i>MANUAL APPENDIX IS NOT PERMITTED
- She does not react. I have no access!</i>
Movement! Movement!
Fire! Fire!
We should have destroyed ZLOPAK,
not the whole damn city!
Come on, Gally.
<i>Obligatory evacuation</i>
<i>Last transport moves
in 33 minutes</i>
<i>Continue to the exit,
mandatory evacuation</i>
Teresa?
What are you doing here?
We have to go. - No, I can not leave.
Not without Thomas.
It's too late.
Do not you understand...
I need more...
See.
Does not slow down the virus,...
... it destroys it.
We have to find Thomas.
The tunnels are straight ahead.
-Shit! Get down!
Shit!
Prepare yourself!
Movement!
Form the first line!
Damn!
What are they waiting for?
Down!
Down!
Get down!
Down!
We have to get out of here!
Let's go!
<i>Is that?...</i>
<i>Inside there?</i>
Thomas is here.
Shit!
Everything OK?
We will not succeed.
What are you talking about?
Take others and take them
while you can still.
Not.
Brenda.
I will not leave you.
Alright?
Forget about it.
Even though you know this
is what you need to do?
<i>Thomas, do not worry!
I come to you!</i>
What are you talking about?
There's a ride!
<i>Wait for us near the tunnel.</i>
Let's go guys.
Transportation has arrived!
Carefully! -Quickly! Quickly!
Do not get stuck.
Vince?
It's nice to see you.
If I knew, I picked up the wanderer.
Let's get rid of this, okay?
We have not finished here yet.
Thomas is still inside.
Let's go for it!
- Come on, let's go. Let's go. Movement.
All right, Newt, we're almost here.
-Start me.
Withdrawal!
Withdrawal!
Let's go!
Kill them all!
They are those.
They are they, we have to go.
Come on!
- Get out of here.
Minho
You have to go for the serum and
get back as fast as you can.
Go, Minho.
She's right. I can cover you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Minho.
Hold on, can you hear me?
Go to Minho, go!
It's okay, they're over.
Newt?
Newt?
Let's try. You have to get up. Come on.
Let's go - No, Thomas.-Newt, come on.
- No, take this. - No. - Come on, take this!
Please.
Please, Tommy, please.
Good.
Listen, I want you to give me everything you have.
You and me. Ready? Come.
One two Three.
Back, back!
Jebate!
All right, let's get outta here.
We can not stay here, Brenda.
Do not worry, they'll come.
More, Newt. Stay with me.
Come on.
Newt, no, no.
Come.
<i>Thomas?</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
<i>I want you to listen to me.</i>
I know you have no
reason to trust me,
but you need to come back.
<i>Thomas, you can save Newta.</i>
<i>There's still time.</i>
<i>There is a reason why
Brenda is no longer sick.</i>
<i>It's your blood.</i>
<i>Do you understand that?</i>
<i>He's not sick anymore</i>
<i>because you cured her.</i>
<i>It does not have to be the only one.</i>
<i>All you have to do is get back.</i>
<i>All this will end.</i>
Please.
Come back.
<i>I know you know...</i>
Newt?
Newt?
Newt, I am. It's me
Brenda!
Where's the serum?
Tommy, kill me!
Newt, that's me.
Newt, please!
Please!
I'm sorry, Tommy.
All is well.
All is well.
Not!
Brenda!
-Thomas!
Stay down!
Newt.
Tommy.
No no.
Newt!
Is that true?
Newt.
Could I save him?
You can save us all.
All is well.
Just leave others alone.
I promise you.
I...
Oh, Thomas.
You had to learn...
<i>Thomas.</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
Do you know what this place is, Thomas?
It's a lifeboat.
Maybe the whole world is drowning, but...
It does not mean we
have to drown with it.
How much?
-How long I'm done.
Why do not you kill me?
- Do I kill you?
Why would I do that?
We will take special
care of you.
We'll keep you alive.
Only...
In turn...
You will give life to the rest of us.
If we decide to save somebody.
It certainly will not
be enough for everyone.
Hard decisions are needed.
Over time, the torch virus will disappear.
The only question is:
Who will stay alive?
Thanks to you.
Thanks to this, we will
finally be able to choose.
The Future of Your Choice.
Cheers.
All right, let's get outta here.
Come on!
Not!
Come here!
Not!
Give me that!
Give me that!
Teresa!
Come on!
Good.
That's enough.
Ready?
At my command!
Full!
-ready!
Pali!
Teresa!
We have to get out of here.
What's wrong?
Thomas...
Thomas!
Calm down. We need...
-Shit.
We need something.
Behold!
Press and hold firmly!
You have to go.
You have to go.
Not.
Not without you.
I admit, Teresa, that you
managed to mislead me.
I thought we were friends.
It may be your nature
to give close people.
Come
Let's not get this off.
We both know there's
no way out of here.
Do not do this worse
than we need.
Thomas.
Teresa.
No no.
I think you have something mine.
Not that.
Where is he?
Take the serum!
Leave him alone!
What is this with you?
Do you think it's special?
He's just a laboratory mouse.
He was born with that gift. It did not
had to fight for it. He never earned it.
He does not deserve it.
Maybe.
But he is.
What about you, Thomase?
What do you have to say?
Are not your hands enough bloody?
Maybe I can not
shoot, but I can...
Okay good.
Let it be you.
Jansson!
You're sorry, Seronjo.
Did I?
Shit!
Come on, we gotta go!
Here. Come on!
Let's go!
In.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
know
I think I found it!
All right, open the back door!
- Alright. Good good.
Come on!
Not!
I can not get closer!
Thomas!
Come on, just a little bit!
Come on, come on, Thomas!
Give me a hand!
Come closer!
Jump!
Lower!
Try to get us closer!
Hold on!
Give me a hand! Reach out!
Pull it!
Pull!
Come on, come on!
Teresa!
Not!
We've been together a lot together.
We did a lot of victims.
Much to make this
place possible.
Your friends,
your family...
This is for those who are not with us.
For the friends we've lost.
This place is for them.
For all of us.
But this...
This is for them.
So when you're ready,
in your way...
Find comfort.
Welcome to a safe haven!
Who Wants Food?
This will be a good home for us.
That.
You had this with you when
you lost consciousness.
I thought I should
keep you safe.
Thanks, Minho.
See you out there.
See you out there.
<i>Dear Thomas,</i>
<i>This is the first
letter I wrote.</i>
<i>Although I do not know whether I
wrote them before the labyrinth.</i>
<i>But even if that was
not my first letter,</i>
<i>most likely to be my last.</i>
<i>I want you to know I'm not scared.</i>
<i>Do not die, forget more.</i>
<i>What I'm going to stop being
my own is what scares me.</i>
<i>So every night I repeat the
names: Alby, Winston, Chuck...</i>
<i>I continue to repeat
them as a prayer.</i>
<i>Memories wound me.</i>
<i>Sit as when the sun strikes in the dune
before it disappears behind the walls.</i>
<i>I remember the taste of Tavine soup.</i>
<i>I did not think I could miss it.</i>
<i>I remember you,</i>
<i>when you came out of the box.
Small, scared</i>
<i>A jerk that can not
remember his name.</i>
<i>From the moment you entered the labyrinth I
knew I would follow you wherever you go.</i>
<i>I did.</i>
<i>We are all.</i>
<i>If I could repeat it all again I would do the same.
And I would not change anything.</i>
<i>My hope for you is</i>
<i>that when you go through the
years and you can say the same.</i>
<i>The future is now in
your hands, Tommy.</i>
<i>I know you will find a
way to do it right.</i>
<i>You always did that.</i>
<i>Watch out for everything for me.</i>
<i>Watch yourself.</i>
<i>You deserved happiness.</i>
<i>Thank you for being my friend.</i>
<i>Goodbye to a friend,</i>
<i>Newt.</i>
