<i>May 17th, 2009.</i>
<i>Further research on Himiko.</i>
<i>According to legend, Himiko,
the first queen of Japan,</i>
<i>was a powerful sorceress</i>
<i>who ruled her empire
through dark magic,</i>
<i>spreading death
and destruction</i>
<i>by the mere touch of her hand.</i>
<i>She was only stopped
by a single twist of fate.</i>
<i>An army of her own generals
bound and dragged Himiko</i>
<i>to an uninhabitable island</i>
<i>in the middle of
the treacherous Devil's Sea.</i>
<i>There, she remains entombed
beneath the mountains.</i>
<i>I found a speck on an old map
that no one else has.</i>
<i>And she's there,</i>
<i>waiting to be unleashed.</i>
<i>I have to get there first.</i>
<i>Even if it means
doing the last thing</i>
<i>I'd ever want to do...</i>
<i>Leaving my Lara behind.</i>
<i>You gotta
make decisions, Lara.</i>
You gotta make
something happen.
Counter-punching
doesn't work for you.
You don't have the skill.
- Thanks, Terry.
- You're welcome.
Come on, Lara!
Stop dancing, start fighting.
Yes, girl!
Come on!
Nice one, Lara!
You've got this!
- It's over.
- Isn't!
Then get out of it!
Come on, Lara! Tap out.
Don't say it.
You got whupped, girl.
You got whupped.
- Not whupped.
- Okay. Not whupped.
Marmalized.
"Marmalized"? She's not
a freakin' superhero.
Truth is, I let her...
We cool?
Yeah, we're cool.
Was fun actually!
Thanks.
I'll get you next time.
I'll marmalize you.
You're home early
tonight, right?
Yup.
Catch you later.
Laters.
Hey! Who stole my apple?
Should've known it was you.
Why would I do
a thing like that?
'Cause you can't afford
your own.
Just seen you're behind
with your payments.
Terry, look, I'll catch up
on the payments, I promise.
I'll make it up to you.
Get a job, Lara.
Do you think I'm dressed
like this for fun?
I like you, Lara.
I really do, but...
- Hey.
- Hi.
- All good?
- Yeah. Havin' a great day.
You?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Ask her more. Ask her for
dinner or something. Do it.
Come on.
Anything else?
No, no, no.
What is your problem?
Why didn't you ask her?
Stupid boy.
You got that fox hunt
sorted, Rog?
Yeah, more or less.
Got 30 hounds signed up.
Just gotta find a fox now.
- Tough one, that.
- Mmm.
Need someone quick enough
to make it interesting.
Yeah. No fun
if they ain't quick.
But dumb enough
to think they can win.
What are you two plotting?
We're gonna do a fox hunt.
- A what?
- Well, it's like a race.
Except the fox gets
a head start,
leavin' a paint trail
behind his bike.
For the baying hounds
to follow.
And if they haven't caught him
by the time
the paint runs out...
He wins all the money.
How much money?
600 quid.
I think you just
found yourself a fox.
Oh, you're bein' serious?
Not quick or dumb enough
for you?
No, I mean, I just...
You're on.
"Hide fox, and all after!"
Ooh, Shakespeare?
<i>Hamlet,</i> is it?
Don't know.
Things just stick in my brain.
You know it's <i>Hamlet.</i>
And I ask you once again,
why on earth
are you a bike courier?
You, Bruce.
I wanna be close to you.
Five, four, three,
two, one! Go!
Hey!
Excuse me!
Go, go, go!
Where is she, bro?
<i>I won't be long,
my love.</i>
- Oi! Watch where you're going!
- Use your mirrors!
Go! Go!
Fancy seeing you here.
Ana.
You didn't have to come.
I don't need
a guardian anymore.
Really?
Have you been decorating?
Haven't seen you
for a long time.
You've never seen me.
I'm sorry.
Thanks for coming.
What was today about?
I needed the money.
No, you don't.
There's an inheritance
waiting for you
if only you would step...
I won't.
It's been seven years, Lara.
Tokyo police stopped looking
for your father
five years ago.
Private investigators won't
even take our money anymore.
I know it's difficult
to accept.
But you really must come in
and sign those papers now.
Hmm. That's why you came.
No. I came for you.
Just think what you can do
for the world,
with your potential,
with your wealth.
His wealth. Not mine.
Listen, it's very simple...
If you don't sign the papers,
then everything your father
worked for will be sold off.
Not just the company,
but Croft Manor, also.
Can you imagine how he would
feel if you lost the house?
Lara, your father's gone.
But you can pick up
where he left off.
It's in your blood.
I'm sorry.
I'm just not
that kind of Croft.
<i>But I don't
want you to go, Daddy.</i>
I won't be long, my love.
You must understand.
We Crofts, we have
responsibilities, jobs to do.
But I'll miss you.
I know. I'll miss you, too.
But I may have
a solution to that.
See this?
This was your mother's,
so it has special powers.
What do you mean?
Ever you want to feel close
to someone,
just put it in your hand,
and you hold it tightly.
And you think of that person,
and they'll know.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It's magic.
And it means
that we'll always be together,
wherever I am.
Okay?
I'll be back
before you know I'm gone.
Oi!
Couriers round the back.
Uh, I'm not a courier.
Well, I am.
Right. So round the back.
I'm here to see Ana Miller.
Well, you gotta
sign in like everyone else.
What's your name?
Lara.
Lara.
Croft.
The pages
that require a signature
are marked
for your convenience.
Would you like Mr. Yaffe
to take you
through the particulars?
I gather I sign
and Dad is dead.
I can imagine
how difficult this is for you.
I miss him, too.
That was Dad's.
Yes, Miss Croft.
According to Richard's will,
in the event of his death
I was to give it to you.
<i>Karakuri.</i> Japanese puzzle.
Um, technically speaking,
you're meant to sign
the papers first.
I could never understand
your father's obsession
with those things.
Wouldn't believe
how many of these
were lying around the house.
There was gonna be
some purpose to it.
"The first letter
from my final destination."
But he didn't leave a letter.
- If you'll excuse me.
- Lara, I...
"My final destination."
The first letter.
What the...
Dad, what were you up to?
<i>Hello, sprout.</i>
<i>I knew I could trust you
to solve my puzzle.</i>
<i>Unfortunately, if you're
watching this tape,</i>
<i>then, uh, it means
that I must be dead.</i>
<i>It'll be obvious to you by now</i>
<i>that there was more to my life</i>
<i>than just boardrooms
and business deals.</i>
<i>Things that I couldn't
tell you about before.</i>
<i>When your mother died,
grief nearly destroyed me.</i>
<i>I began searching the world,</i>
<i>desperate for a hint
of another realm,</i>
<i>for proof that
the supernatural is real.</i>
<i>Anything to feel her
with me again.</i>
<i>I made quite
a hobby of it, sprout.</i>
<i>Now...</i>
<i>I need you to do me a favor.</i>
<i>I need you to burn
all my research</i>
<i>on the Himiko project.</i>
<i>Just burn all of it.</i>
<i>The notebooks,
the tapes, everything.</i>
<i>It's very important.</i>
<i>If it falls
into the wrong hands,</i>
<i>then it could be catastrophic,</i>
<i>so please do it straightaway.</i>
<i>I know you hate
being told what to do,</i>
<i>but please promise me that.</i>
<i>I hope you never
have to see this tape.</i>
<i>But if you do,</i>
<i>you've found
my secret calling.</i>
<i>I hope you find yours.</i>
Dad loves you.
"Himiko."
<i>October 5th.</i>
<i>They called Queen Himiko
the "Mother of Death."</i>
<i>All the stories about her</i>
<i>end in rivers
running red with blood.</i>
<i>Bewitching people,
controlling minds,</i>
<i>spreading death
and destruction</i>
<i>with just
the touch of her hand.</i>
<i>The bloodshed only ended</i>
<i>when her own generals
buried her alive in a tomb,</i>
<i>sealing her away
from the outside world,</i>
<i>on an island
no one could reach.</i>
<i>History's all but erased
its existence.</i>
<i>The lost island of Yamatai.</i>
<i>I'm certain this is the place.</i>
<i>July 29th, 2011.</i>
<i>I finally found a captain</i>
<i>willing to take me
to the island.</i>
<i>I must get there first
to ensure her powers</i>
<i>will never fall
into the wrong hands.</i>
Uh...
That amulet was given
to my father
by Emperor Showa of Japan.
Right. Right. Well...
This ain't from Japan.
You're correct.
Emperor Showa
was given it by the grandson
of the former emperor
of Maratha.
"Maratha"? You're having
a laugh, in't ya?
And he, himself,
got it from Thibaw,
the last king of Burma
when he was exiled in India.
- "Exiled in India."
- Mmm.
What a fascinating tale.
And you got
all this, uh, provenance
down on paper, do ya?
If I had
the provenance on paper,
I'd be at Christie's,
wouldn't I?
But, um...
This is your lucky day.
Is it?
Alan!
What have I told you
about flirting
with the customers?
I'm not flirting. I'm just
naturally charismatic.
I was not flirting. I'm sorry.
I was flirting.
Have a look.
Big smiles, nice and casual.
Right, well,
I'm pleased to say
we're in a position
to make you an offer.
Ten.
Please?
Just a tad bit more.
That's all I have
to remember my dad by.
Oh. Oh, your dad died.
That's a shame.
It's a terrible thing
for a young woman
to lose her father.
Really. All right.
Fair enough.
9,000.
You just said 10.
Well, people come in here
trying the dead dad shit
all the time.
And you fall for it
all the time.
I don't fall for it
all the time.
Last week,
you fell for it twice.
I fell for it twice.
It's the truth.
Fine. I'm happy
to keep negotiating.
Because now
the price is eight.
- Okay. You win.
- Ah, finally.
Thank you. Really.
Thank you.
For just
such occasions.
For just such occasions.
You burnt me taters!
Sort yourself out, Alan.
Seriously.
That is hot coffee.
Excuse me,
do you speak English?
Sorry, no.
No? Thank you.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Do you know a Lu Ren? Lu Ren?
Not even a tiny bit?
- Do you speak English?
- Lady.
You need help?
Yes. I do.
I'm looking
for this guy called Lu Ren.
Um, he's supposed to...
- Lu Ren boat.
- Yes.
<i>Endurance.</i> Over there.
<i>"Endurance"?</i> Which one?
Oi!
Wait!
Stay back.
Gimme the bag.
You just lost your tip.
You just lose your tongue.
Lu! Lu Ren!
Help! Help!
Run! Run! He's drunk again!
Thank you.
What?
I said what
are you doing on my boat?
I'm not with them.
I'm looking for a man
named Lu Ren.
Congratulations, you found me.
Now get lost.
Please. Wait.
Just listen. I need...
Okay, let's go.
I'm not here
to make any trouble.
Keep walking.
Could you please
put that gun down and just...
Oh, for God's sake.
My father, Richard Croft,
tried to buy a boat from you.
No. No. Not me, he didn't.
Yes, he did.
Your name is Lu Ren.
This is from you.
Yes, I know my name, thanks.
It's the same as my father's,
and he wrote that, not me.
Well, then I need
to talk to him.
You and 100 other people
he owed money...
- Where is he?
- I don't know, okay?
One day,
he just left on his boat,
and I never saw him again,
all right?
Was this seven years ago?
I think I know
where they went. Our dads.
To the bottom
of the sea?
They were headed
to an uninhabited island.
Somewhere off the coast
of Japan.
It used to be called Yamatai.
I'm gonna go there
and find out
what happened to them.
Good luck. There's at least
6,000 islands
off the coast of Japan,
and hardly any of them
are populated.
Well, I have a map.
Now, all I need to do is to
figure out what these are.
I think these are coordinates.
The location.
They're clock hands.
They're not
clock hands.
Definitely not
clock hands. They're...
They are clock hands.
Three...
That's the one.
That's right in the middle
of the Devil's Sea.
You might as well
tie a stone to your foot
and jump off the boat now.
It'll be an adventure.
Death is not an adventure.
Don't you want to know
what happened to them?
I just don't care
anymore, okay?
Look, I'm a busy guy.
I got stuff to do.
How much did you lose
last night?
What makes you think I lost?
Well, it looked like you were
drowning your sorrows,
not celebrating.
Yours if you help me
get to Yamatai.
And what will I spend it on,
a coffin?
Then I'll go and get myself
two rust buckets like this
with that.
Even if you had a boat,
or two,
you'd sink 'em before
you even left the harbor.
What you need
is an experienced captain.
So, what's in the other shoe?
<i>June 23rd.</i>
<i>I may have found
the next piece to the puzzle.</i>
<i>Ancient drawings hint
to the location of the tomb</i>
<i>and an elaborate door
to keep her contained.</i>
<i>I've found a way
to decipher the codes.</i>
<i>I'm sure I can get to her.</i>
<i>The ancient
Nihongi chronicles state</i>
<i>that within the tomb,</i>
<i>one must face
the "Ordeals of Himiko."</i>
<i>Cross the Chasm of Souls,</i>
<i>pray to survive
the faces of Himiko,</i>
<i>behold her army
of a thousand handmaidens,</i>
<i>descend upon
Himiko's final resting place,</i>
<i>unleashing her scourge.</i>
<i>July 6th. I'm convinced</i>
<i>that my progress
is being monitored.</i>
<i>I know them by name now...</i>
<i>The Order of Trinity.</i>
<i>An ancient
militant organization</i>
<i>that seeks control
over the supernatural</i>
<i>to rule the fate of mankind.</i>
<i>What if Himiko is the weapon</i>
<i>that Trinity has been seeking?</i>
Can't sleep?
It's beautiful.
Enjoy it
while you can.
We're headed into the most
dangerous stretch of water
between Hong Kong
and California.
Your dad sure knew
how to pick a holiday.
Yeah. He had a knack for
the unexpected. Apparently.
I am starting to wonder
if he'd gone mad, though.
He didn't seem to know what
was real and what wasn't,
obsessing over some
ancient Japanese death queen.
Hey, some men
like dangerous women.
Some men are foolish.
What?
Good night, Lu Ren.
Sweet dreams.
Not William Tell yet,
but you're close.
William Tell was a myth, Dad.
Well, all myths
have foundation in reality.
I have to head off, sprout.
But you've only
just come back.
- I'll be back before...
- I even know you're gone.
Ana will keep an eye on you.
I don't need one of
your employees babysitting me.
I can take care of myself.
My girl.
Lara
Never forget Dad loves you.
I know.
Thought that might wake you.
Your island's found us.
Yamatai.
We've lost all control!
- We need to abandon ship.
- What?
We're dead
in the water.
It's not gonna hold
much longer.
We need to get off
this boat now.
Wait!
Dad's papers!
Forget them! Lara!
Oh!
Lara. Come on!
Lu!
The lifeboat!
Watch out!
Lu!
Lu!
Where am I?
Ah! She's awake.
I was beginning
to get worried about you.
A reef.
You hit it.
Thank God I found you.
Most people who try to
come here die in the currents.
Almost impossible to get here.
Even harder to leave.
Where's my...
Right here.
What are you doing here, Lara?
I have two daughters.
Dark hair like you.
Pretty like you.
Forgive me. Rude.
I haven't hosted a guest
here in a very long time.
My name is Mathias Vogel.
You must be hungry.
You know, I used to imagine
that I might find an ear
inside one of
those cans eventually.
Isn't that mad?
I guess being on this island
for so long
can make you a little crazy.
The only person
that I get to talk to
is on the other end
of this phone.
And they always say
the same thing...
I can't go home until
my work on the island is done.
What kind of work do you do?
Oh, a mix of things.
At the mercy of my employer.
You looking for this?
The machinations of fate
never cease to amaze me.
"The door to Himiko."
Richard had the entrance.
All that wasted time.
You have brought me the thing
that I most wanted
in this world.
Thank you.
What do you know
about my father?
Now I see the likeness.
The intelligence in the face.
The recklessness.
All he had to do
was cooperate.
Of course, being Richard,
he refused.
Thought he was saving
the world.
Where is he?
Where is he?
He's with God now.
I killed him.
I'm sorry if I was too blunt.
I'm out of practice.
It's been seven years.
Seven years.
Come on.
Come on, come on!
Come on. Get down there.
Get those skids moving!
Move.
Move!
Let's go!
Pick it up!
Come on, go!
Tie her up!
Okay, winch it up!
Back to work.
Lara Croft.
You shouldn't have come here.
But I'm glad that you did.
Pack it up. We're moving camp!
- All right, let's pack it up!
- Okay, move out!
We're moving camp!
Keep it moving!
You, move!
Move it, move it.
Pick it up! Come on, let's go!
Who are these people?
Some are
shipwrecked fishermen.
And some paid smugglers
to take 'em to a better life.
Instead,
they brought 'em here.
Come on!
We're backed up here. Move!
He said he killed my dad.
He killed mine.
They saw it.
Cold-blooded murder.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry
that I brought you here.
Well, you did take advantage
of a drunken sailor.
Come on, move!
At least we're not dead yet.
No shit.
I need
some CL 20 up here!
Come on, let's go!
You okay?
Get him up and back to work
right now.
Hang on.
- Right now!
- Let him rest. We'll manage.
Get him back
to work right now!
He's sick, man.
He needs to rest.
Get back to work!
You heard him!
Let's get back to work!
Hey, Lara.
Lara! Get ready.
Hey.
Go!
Go!
Look out!
Let's spread out!
Spread out!
Get her!
Get a move on!
Grab her!
She's in the river.
You want us to follow?
No.
I'm sending Rocket
to track her.
If she survives,
he'll bring her back.
Really?
Easy now, easy.
I'm taking you back to camp.
Stop struggling!
Wait!
No, no, no, no!
I'm not mad.
I'm not mad, I'm not mad.
Just ignore it. It'll go away.
Dad?
It's me.
Dad?
It's not real. Ignore it.
It'll go away. It always does.
No, look at me, look at me.
Please.
Do you remember this?
Do you remember:
We used to...
It's me.
It's Lara.
Sprout.
What the blazes
are you doing here?
Dad, I'm hurt.
It's all right.
This will hurt me
more than it hurts you.
What?
All right.
You're all right.
You're all right.
All right. It's all right.
It's done.
Rest now.
Will you stay with me?
I'm not going anywhere.
Vogel! We found it! Yeah!
Yeah! Come on! We found it!
I found it.
Send the transport.
I thought you'd gone.
Usually when I see you
on this island,
it's you who disappears.
Let me do that.
Come here.
So, sprout,
where did you end up?
Did you go
to Oxford or Cambridge?
Come on, which was it?
You know what, Dad?
I didn't go to university.
Well, there's time yet.
You're still only a child.
No, I was a child
when you left me.
Ah, careful.
Hardest day of my life
when I gave up
trying to get back to you.
But I realized
she'd never let me leave.
What are you talking about?
Who's "she"?
Himiko.
Trinity had sent Vogel
to find her tomb
so that he could wake her
and get her power.
I had to stop them.
Right.
Vogel can't find the tomb
without me.
And since I'm dead
and since you've burnt
the rest of my research,
he'll never find it.
So...
About that.
What part of
"burn all my papers"
did you not understand?
If I'd burned the papers,
I wouldn't have found you.
I set diversions and false
leads wherever I could.
I watched for years
as they got it wrong.
And now you lead them
by the hand.
So a gun-toting psychopath
finds some ancient remains.
So what?
If Vogel opens that tomb,
Himiko's curse will be
unleashed on the world.
Dad, listen...
You coming here was a mistake.
I came here to find out
what happened to you.
So long as the tomb was safe,
you were safe.
I was trying to keep you safe.
But I underestimated your...
My what?
- Stupidity?
- No.
Your bravery.
We have to get off
this island.
There's no way off, Lara.
Vogel's got a satellite phone.
We can get to it.
We can call for help.
Vogel has an army.
You were the one who taught me
to never give up.
That was a different time.
When I was a different man.
- Lara.
- Well, I'm still his daughter.
Lara!
Come on!
Try another combination.
And another one,
and another one.
Come on. Come on,
give me the damn code.
Hey. We're trying
the explosives again.
Set another charge.
Yes, boss.
Get over there.
Stop talking.
Get the guns.
I'm gonna get the sat phone.
Then we'll find a way for all
of us to get out of here.
We need to leave now.
Vogel! They re escaping!
Go!
Shoot them!
- Get them to safety.
- Okay.
I'll be right behind you. Go.
Shit.
We have to move.
I have to wait here.
I'm not leaving Lara behind.
It's beautiful,
isn't it, Richard?
I wish I would've known
that you were alive
all these years.
At least I would've had
somebody to talk to.
I need your help, Richard.
Get the door open for me.
It's been seven years.
I'm going home
to see my family.
If I open that tomb,
you won't have a family.
Open it!
Open it!
Open it!
Never!
Have it your way.
With or without you,
I'm getting inside that tomb.
Put that down!
Put it down.
You don't think
I can pull this trigger
before you hit me
with that arrow.
Shoot him, Lara. Shoot him!
Come on, put your weapon down.
Shoot him, Lara. We can't
let him get to Himiko.
You really don't believe
this nonsense, do you?
Tell your father to
open the door, or he's dead.
You can make him do it, Lara.
Transport's already
on its way.
We can all be
off this goddamn island.
Let him shoot me.
Sacrificing one life
is worth saving millions.
It's your decision.
It's your finger
that's pulling this trigger.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
I haven't come all this way
to see you die.
I'll do it.
I'll open it.
Finally, a Croft
with some sense.
Ladies first.
Mark the path.
She's still breathing.
Or it's a change in
atmospheric pressure.
Keep walking.
You should've seen
the look on your...
That wasn't designed
to keep people out.
That was put there
to keep people in.
Dad?
Chasm of Souls.
You go next.
"Pray to survive
the faces of Himiko."
We're getting closer.
"The Death Queen
turns day to night.
"She must die
to bring back life."
Oh, shit.
- The floor!
- Lara!
There's gotta be a way
to stop this.
Look around!
Come on. Come on!
Vogel, what's going on?
"Pray to survive."
It's a keyhole. We need a key!
The prayer wheels!
Lara!
It's not working.
Check the other prayer wheels.
Try this!
No.
Wait.
It's a color puzzle.
"The Death Queen
turns the day to night."
- Black.
- Black! Here!
Shit!
Blue!
No!
Here!
It doesn't work.
Lara!
Last one! Yellow!
It's not working.
Just try them all, damn it!
"The Death Queen
turns the day to night."
"She must die
to bring back..."
"Life."
Come on!
The color of life.
I'm running out of floor!
Green!
You always were the brains
of the family, sprout.
Well, let's get going, sprout.
Where's the floor?
Gone.
Flare.
Come on, Lara.
I'm going back for her.
I'm coming with you.
You dad gave his life for us.
Himiko's army of
a thousand handmaidens.
They sacrificed themselves
in ritual suicide
to serve their queen
in the afterlife.
Exactly as your notes.
We found her.
All right, this is it.
We're finishing this.
It's not too late
to change your mind.
There's a very big difference
between myth and reality,
Richard.
Something that you could
never understand.
Gentlemen.
Open it.
You see? I told you there was
nothing to be afraid of.
It's just...
...a little old lady.
Prepare her for transport.
Something doesn't add up.
She's not a monster
in any of these paintings.
It looks like she was
taking herself here.
Not being forced.
<i>The Death Queen
turns day to night.</i>
<i>She must die
to bring back life.</i>
"Bring back life."
<i>Spreading
death and destruction</i>
<i>with just the touch
of her hand.</i>
Go on.
All myths have
foundation in reality.
...in reality.
Sacrificing one life
is worth saving millions.
Wait!
She was sacrificing herself.
She was protecting the world.
See?
Smoke and mirrors.
All right, let's bag her up.
Come on.
They thought it was magic.
She was a carrier.
She was immune.
It's a disease.
This is what Trinity wants.
This gets me home.
If you take this out
into the world, it's genocide.
I just need to take
a very small piece of you.
Go! Get her! Get her!
Well, this is it, Richard.
All we have to do
is walk out of here.
You're not going anywhere.
Come on, Richard.
Think of your daughter.
Come on.
Come on.
- Dad.
- Lara.
Vogel's gone.
- You need to go after him.
- Come on, let's go.
- No, stay back. Stay back.
- What are you talking...
I'm done for.
I'm infected.
No.
You can't touch me.
Don't touch.
You must stop Vogel
and get the hell out of here.
And I'll bury Himiko
once and for all.
I've only just found you.
Promise me you'll stop him.
Promise me!
There must be another way.
Lara.
You're a very, very
bright young woman.
There's no other way.
I need you.
No, you don't.
You're worth 10 of me.
You said you don't
believe in magic.
Well, what's this, my darling?
All this time here...
I wished I could
see you grow up.
No.
And now I have.
It's a miracle.
Chin up, sprout.
There's jobs to do.
Go on, go!
There's no time, Lara.
Go on, go!
Dad loves you.
I love you.
Oh, you really wanna
do this, little girl?
Let's just go home.
You're not savin' anyone.
Trinity is everywhere.
Yeah?
I made a promise.
No. No. No!
You're not
getting out of here.
No! No!
When you see Richard,
send him my regards.
Send them yourself.
You messed
with the wrong family.
Lara!
Lara!
Lara?
Well...
We're not dead yet.
No shit.
Vogel, Vogel, this is
Patna Transport Bravo 5. Over.
Vogel, Vogel,
are you reading me? Over.
Boss.
You're takin' us home, yeah?
Officially gone. Like magic.
I don't think he has gone.
- I see so much of him in you.
- Thanks, Ana.
Really.
You're in charge now, Lara.
This is a list
of all our assets.
Thank you.
No, I think you'd better stay
on top of
the day-to-day things, Ana.
Well, as you wish.
Boardrooms and business deals.
I'm just not
that kind of Croft.
Neither was Dad,
as it turns out.
Are all these companies
owned by us?
Yes.
<i>I know them
by name now...</i>
<i>The Order of Trinity.</i>
<i>An ancient
militant organization</i>
<i>that seeks control
over the supernatural</i>
<i>in order to rule
the fate of mankind.</i>
<i>What kind of work
do you do?</i>
<i>Oh, a mix of things.
At the mercy of my employer.</i>
<i>Are all these companies
owned by us?</i>
<i>You're not
savin' anyone.</i>
<i>Trinity is everywhere.</i>
<i>I know it's difficult
to accept.</i>
But you really must come in
and sign those papers now.
<i>I think
you'd better stay</i>
<i>on top of
the day-to-day things, Ana.</i>
<i>As you wish.</i>
<i>The only person
that I get to talk to</i>
<i>is on the other end
of this phone.</i>
<i>You must understand.</i>
<i>We Crofts,
we have responsibilities.</i>
Jobs to do.
Oh. You again.
I came back for the amulet.
Shame. I was hoping
you'd forgotten.
It's worth a bloody fortune.
I did tell you
it was your lucky day.
Yes, you did.
- At it again, are we, Alan?
- I'm not at it.
I don't know
if you've noticed or not,
but, uh, you can't be
too careful these days
because the world
has gone bloody mad.
Yes, yes, thank you, Alan.
What you got there is
a HK USP 9 mil. extended mag.
It's my personal favorite.
You like that?
I do.
Mmm.
I'll take two.
