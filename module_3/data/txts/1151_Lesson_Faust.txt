I have studied philosophy devotedly,
as well as law and medicine...
...and also, to my everlasting shame...
...Theology
And after all that, here I am,
a poor crazy old man...
...as ignorant as I was in the beginning.
Not even a dog would want to live like this.
The knowledge I obtained has not brought me happiness.
So I have decided to elevate my soul...
...through the arts of black magic and obscure alchemy.
Faust, Faust.
Turn aside your inquisitive eye and penetrating mind...
...from these black arts and return to Theology.
For happiness and true joy...
...are only to be found under the rule of the Law
If you live in accord with the Law,
then you will escape the wrath of God...
...and you will have your celestial reward.
Faust, Faust.
Lay aside the study of Theology...
Rather, profess your devotion...
...to the obscure practice of the dark arts.
Do it, and your reward will be here on earth.
The power that I offer you exceeds...
...that of all the kings and emperors
Your Excellency, excuse my intrusion.
I have come unannounced to inform Your Excellency...
...that two friends...
...are waiting below in the street, may it please Your Excellency.
Cornelio and Valdes.
They say they bring important news...
...which requires Your Majesty's urgent attention.
Now I withdraw.
Oh, ignoble life, full of pain!
I speak the truth, for thus it is.
Here we have a scholar who is renowned...
...because of his devotion to obscure arts,
(that is what they say).
He is known by the name of Doctor Faust.
Wherever he goes he follows his nose...
...buried in his books.
And perhaps some go missing that way.
Not that it would do that emptyhead any harm...
...a little -or a lot- more knowledge then we'll see...
...how study really suits me!
What's this?
Here's a well-thumbed book.
It's open, I'll read a little.
"Ego Christian,...
.... ego istin, prima legura iuri".
What's this? Why can't I understand the words?
I'll try and find a simpler page.
Ah, this is better, this I understand, yes.
How to transform an evil-smelling old harridan...
...into a beautiful ripe young virgin.
Take a good-sized cauldron and add the the following...
...to obtain the desired flavour.
Alder leaves, rotten onions...
...(that's to get rid of bunions).
Add stinging nettles and caraways...
...(to smooth out wrinkled skin).
Finally put a few roots in that secret place.
"Probatum est"
There's so much here, I'll just have to
sit down and reflect.
And what my poor brain can't comprehend...
...may well be understood by my other end.
Miserable worm, how dare you
desecrate this book, of whose wisdom...
...your thick head will not admit one drop.
Follow my advice and move your ass...
...before you get booted out the door
"... estim prima leguri iuri"
What did you say?
How do I know? It's Latin.
I warned you. Get out of here.
That's unfair, you biffed me in the ear.
You're off your head, and you're babbling to boot.
Do you have the intelligence to serve my Master
Why not?
If I'm dressed in fine clothes...
and paid well, and fed well...
and I'm not asked for anything in return,
then I'll do it!
If you're really serious...
...then sign.
I, Johannes Faust....
...summon you, Mephistopheles...
Mephistopheles!
Mephistopheles!
Mephistopheles! Mephistopheles!
Now, Faust...
...what do you ask of Mephistopheles?
I demand, Mephistopheles, that you serve me...
...and that while I live...
...you perform whatever service that I, Faustus,...
...require of you.
Whether it be...
...that the moon tumbles...
...from its orbit...
...or that the ocean...
...devours the earth.
I am only a humble servant of the great Lucifer...
...and can only serve you with His Permission.
We can only execute what He Commands.
So perhaps he didn't order you...
...to appear before me?
No, I came here of my own accord.
Do you mean to say that my spells
did not conjure you forth?
Speak.
They were the cause, but "per accidens".
Because, when we hear someone
blaspheme in the name of God...
and abjure the Scriptures,
and reject Christ his Saviour...
...we fly to capture his glorious soul
Let us stop this vain and fruitless...
...talk of "the soul"...
...Tell me...
...who is this Lucifer, your Lord?
He is the Arch-Regent and Commandant
of all the spirits.
And is it true that Lucifer, at one time, was an angel?
Yes, Faust, he was the most beloved of God.
And how is it that he has now become...
...the Prince among the Demons?
Because of his most ambitious pride and insolence...
...for which God expelled him from the Halls of Paradise.
And what of you...
...who live with Lucifer?
We are unhappy spirits who fell with Lucifer...
...who conspired against our God with Lucifer...
...and are forever condemmed
to suffer the same fate as Lucifer.
To what are you condemmed?
To the fires of the Pit.
How is it possible then...
...that you have now escaped from Hell,
and are here at my side?
Why? For this is Hell, nor have I left Him.
Do you think that I, who have gazed upon the face of God...
...and have experienced the eternal joy of Paradise,
can still escape the torture of 10,000 hells...
...and enter a personal realm of perfect bliss?.
Bring this to the attention of Lord Lucifer:
Say that Faust will render...
...his soul...
...only at the end of 24 years...
...after a life of perfect voluptuousness...
...it being understood that during this time
you will always attend me...
...and supply me with whatever I require.
I will do it.
I also want an answer to this fundamental question...
...taken from the doctor's library:
"How to catch a bird without salt or noose...
...using only a single magic formula...
...uttered once inside a pentagram?"
So do we promise.
Is it that simple?
Or is it not?
Yes, it is.
Now it only remains to say the
magic word and trap the bird.
Assembled spirits, hear me say:
¡Filiuquei!
Alas, why do you use conjuration...
...to invoke the demons from the fires of hell?
You're going to annoy them...
It was not my intention to set free the Devil.
I'm only catching birds.
Come out from the safety of the circle.
Come in yourself, I defy you.
That I cannot do.
I think I'll stay inside.
Come out for a minute, and I'll turn you
into a puff of smoke.
This devil is not very convincing,
to have to say that.
Let us hope so.
This is making me a bit nervous.
Paliuquei!
Piliuquei!
Piliuquei!
Oh, I'm all confused!
I seem to have forgotten the word
to get rid of them.
Ah, now I remember!
Paliuquei!
That's it. That's how it's meant to work.
To force them back to the kennel
l say "paliuque".
And to summon them once more
l say "piliuque"!
Oh, you came back.
I'll torment you with this trick I learned.
Paliuquei!
Paliuquei!
Piliuquei!
Paliuquei!
Piliuquei!
I can't take it any more, stop!
You win.
Show some pity, I beg you.
Paliuquei!
And while they've gone,
I'm off, why hang around?
Now tell me, what did Lord Lucifer say?
That I am to serve Faust throughout his life...
...and that he buys my obedience with his own soul.
But Faust, you must commit yourself to it, solemnly...
...by signing the contract of transfer with your own blood.
This is the guarantee demanded by Lord Lucifer.
If you refuse I must return to Hell.
Let us hope, Mephistopheles...
Yes, Mephistopheles, here it is.
A mystery, as you see...
...my pen broke in two, upon the floor.
No more diversions.
Now you must be clear on what we have agreed.
With your blood you have affirmed the pact.
I have seen it, Mephisto, though it seems strange...
...that the pen is already lying there
broken on the floor.
Faustus! You are trying my patience!
Take another pen and sign the pact!
My attendants are waiting, this time you will succeed.
Show me...
...what mysteries the universe conceals,
and those of the sky dome.
Show me all the sounds...
...bright as snowflakes...
...all those secrets which together
make up the Creation...
...in Infinite Space.
- Oh, Faustus, are you afraid?
- Never, Lucifer!
But it hurts here, inside my heart.
Now take me...
...down to hell.
And after that, to the glory
of the Most Highest.
Do I interrupt your rest?
Or do you wish to speak?
What I have learned from you only confirms...
...that great and small are coin of the same species.
And that the elephant...
...with its overwhelming force,
is no different...
...from a tiny insect.
So that still I search for...
...the unstoppable force...
...the motive power, which governs the flow of light...
...and not simply its external manifestation.
The force which governs all, the motive power...
Some things cannot be known.
They are beyond your comprehension
even though they are manifest.
Why does it have to be thus?
Because they lie beyond that
which can be expressed in words.
And man can only comprehend...
those thoughts which can be expressed
in his own language.
Do you mean that words are greater than man?
Certainly that is so.
Then whence comes the desire....
...for affection, or pain and sorrow?
Such things cannot be described.
Even so, I know that they
eat at my breast. What are they?
They have no substance, like a fog.
In that case man is nothing more than cloud or air.
Then what is it that has made me so thirsty?
To be well-instructed in matters which go beyond language.
Your thirst is artificial, induced by your arrogance.
Seek no further than your human brethren.
They sleep, eat, drink, and find that this is sufficient.
Liar! Traitor!
Where is it hidden...
...the secret heart of the world,
which you promised to reveal?
Where?
Faust, you lacked the vision
to discern it in every blade of grass.
Vile phantom!
- Vain spectre!
- Faust! thou worm!
You have rained curses upon me...
...now I will submerge you in a bile
deeper than the deepest ocean.
Thus I learn...
...that the devil knows no more...
...than us, poor creatures.
And the man who sells his soul
to Satan in exchange for knowledge...
...is, in my opinion, a poor creature.
Really, I cannot recommend you
as a guide towards a Higher Truth.
Nevertheless, according to my contract...
...signed in blood...
...you are still obliged to obey me.
So serve thou me.
I will make use of your deceitful guide,
and of your satanic...
...fury.
I remain at your disposition.
Let us go.
I have heard that the king of Portugal
has declared a holiday...
...to celebrate his birthday, number 50.
Mephisto...
Mephisto, transport me toot sweet
to the court of Portugal...
...so that His Majesty may admire
the skills I have acquired.
As you wish, Faustus.
Let us fly!
There is a definite stink
of sulphur in these parts.
Get ready, buffoon...
...to follow Faust...
...who goes to demonstrate his powers
to the King of Portugal.
I'll have to sing and dance
and try not to fart.
And now, shall we begin?
Loyal vassals, heed my true voice.
Today is my birthday.
It is therefore appropriate...
...that we all rejoicymoice,
and lift your glasses to my health.
Devil, stop pushing me, or I'll fall over.
Long live our noble King!
Can I believe my own eyes?
Who is this who lies prostrate before me?
Whatever he asks for, will be granted him.
Provided it can be understood.
I am the servant of Doctor Faust.
You are referring to the famous Doctor Faust?
Is there any other?
Knee high to my mother I heard about...
...his incomparable erudition.
Bring your master here.
It's already done.
Long life to our noble King!
Your Immortal Majesty...
...your humble servant, Doctor Faust.
His Majesty need only command...
...and my art shall decorate this day.
Doctor Faust, arise!
The task that I entrust to you is not simple...
...but worthy of your talents.
Let David stand on your left hand
and Goliath on your right.
Sir, I can perform this simple task.
Mephisto! Mephisto!
- What are your orders?
- Very simple.
His Majesty demands to see the shepherd David...
...confront his fabulous enemy, Goliath.
How boring!
Long live our noble King!
Here. A present from me to His Majesty.
Long live our noble King!
What is it?
A demon is hidden inside this statue!
Charletan, leave my kingdom, and never return.
This is the work of Satan, I recognize it.
Take all your tricks and vamoose.
Let us depart. My people, let us flee.
Who knows what the Enemy might do!
I do not take these insults lightly.
I will be avenged.
Mephisto! Mephisto!
What now, Faust?
Mephisto, you will now inundate
this country with floodwaters.
And then I will walk the waves...
...and dance with delight
upon their mortal corpses.
No longer will I seek to please
when in pursuit of pleasure.
But when I contemplate the heavens...
...then I regret.
And a curse on you, perverse Mephistopheles,
for having deprived me of that joy.
Is it such a glorious thing, the sky vault?
I tell you it is not worth the half...
of any man who breathes in this world.
How can you prove that?
Since it was made for Man...
then Man must be more exalted.
If it was done for Man...
...then it was done for Me.
Renounce magic and repent!
Faust, Faust, repent....
...and our merciful Father who is in heaven
will pardon you!
Now take the shape of the incomparable Helen...
We will visit her once more.
Oh, Faust, Faust!
Your fame has reached me from your distant land.
And here I find you on your knees, in solemn prayer.
Oh, Faustus, come and explore my country...
...explore my eyes, my breasts, my skin.
Never has there existed a more beautiful woman.
The ecstasy of love is well-renowned.
Amor vincit omnia.
Demon, you are the cause of my humiliation.
If you want to catch a bird, don't throw a stone...
...you will only frighten it.
Faust, today, at the midnight hour,
l will take possession of that which is mine.
So soon? Where have they gone, those 24 years?
You only counted your waking hours.
But in reality we served you day and night.
Twice twelve are twenty-four.
And for that reason, when midnight sounds...
...you are Mine, body and soul.
Master, don't give in, you must flee!
If you remain seated here, Sir, then all is lost!
Where do you suggest we go?
Away from the talons of the masked man.
He's outside weeping.
I thought that Faust would be praying.
Go out and find two strong men.
Say to them that if they undertake
to protect me from the infernal host...
...they will be well rewarded.
I'll pay double to whoever
breaks the devil's head
Is somebody looking for work?
I need strong men, payment in advance.
Doctor Faust will pay well for protection
against the forces of hell.
Are you willing to protect my master?
Alright, what about you, no?
You, madam? Interested in a little fun
for a goodly sum?
The Doctor needs men to protect him
for just one hour this night.
He pays well, enough to make a thief rich.
It's an opportunity that you can't possibly miss.
How can anyone pass up such a fortune?
Hey, young man, do you want
to serve my master for good money?
Well? No takers? Then no takers!
The Doctor needs two young people
as bodyguards for one hour this night.
He pays well, enough to make a thief rich.
My master needs safekeeping this night!
You sir, wouldn't you like to help?
Oh, Faust.
There remains but one short hour.
One hour of life.
Then you are condemmed to Hell for all eternity.
My name is Claude.
He's called Claude, and I'm
called Hoper, Doctor Faustus.
Are you ready...
to confront the Devil himself
in order to protect me?
Yes, if you pay well enough.
That's reasonable.
You stand here...
...and you on this side.
Take that, take that!
Oh, strike and strike again.
Now, body, transform into air...
...or Lucifer will soon have you for judgement!
Oh God, don't stare at me with such ferocity!
Vipers and serpents, let me breathe a little.
Oh, monstruous pit of hell, no!
Spare me, Lucifer!
I'll burn my books!
Oh, Mephistopheles!
