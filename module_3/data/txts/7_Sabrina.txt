Once upon a time,
on the north shore of Long Island,
some 30 miles from New York,
there lived a small girl
on a large estate.
The estate was very large indeed
and had many servants.
There were gardeners
to take care of the gardens
and a tree surgeon on a retainer.
There was a boatman
to take care of the boats,
to put them in the water in the spring
and scrape their bottoms in the winter.
There were specialists
to take care of the grounds,
the outdoor tennis court
and the indoor tennis court,
the outdoor swimming pool
and the indoor swimming pool.
And there was a man
of no particular title
who took care
of the small pool in the garden
for a goldfish named George.
Also on the estate
there was a chauffeur
by the name of Fairchild,
who had been imported
from England years ago
together with a new Rolls-Royce.
Fairchild was a fine chauffeur
of considerable polish,
like the eight cars in his care.
And he had a daughter
by the name of Sabrina.
It was the eve
of the annual 6-meter yacht races,
and, as had been
traditional on Long Island
for the past 30 years,
the Larrabees were giving a party.
It never rained on the night
of the Larrabee party.
The Larrabees
wouldn't have stood for it.
There were four Larrabees in all,
father, mother and two sons.
Maude and Oliver Larrabee
were married in 1906,
and among their
many wedding presents
was the townhouse in New York
and this estate for weekends.
The townhouse has since been
converted into Saks Fifth Avenue.
Linus Larrabee, the elder son,
graduated from Yale,
where his classmates
voted him the man most likely
to leave his alma mater $50 million.
His brother, David, went through
several of the best Eastern colleges
for short periods of time
and through several marriages
for even shorter periods of time.
He is now a successful
six-goal polo player
and is listed on Linus' tax return
as a $600 deduction.
Life was pleasant among the Larrabees,
for this was as close to heaven
as one could get on Long Island.
Come on down from there, Sabrina.
Come on.
You better go to your room
and finish your packing.
- Who's that girl, Father?
- Which girl?
The one dancing with David.
Her name's Van Horn,
Gretchen Van Horn.
Chase National Bank.
- I hate girls that giggle all the time.
- You hate every girl David looks at.
Sabrina, you can't go on like this
about David all your life,
you understand that?
You've got to get over it.
Yes, Father.
It's good you're going away.
I only hope it's far enough.
- Yes, Father.
- Come along, Sabrina.
In a minute, Father. You go ahead.
I'll be up soon.
- It's you, Sabrina.
- Hello, David.
I thought I heard somebody.
No. It's nobody.
Gretchen! Yoo-hoo! Tennis, anyone?
Gretchen?
What do we call this, mixed singles?
Oh, no, no, no. Whatever you do,
you have to stay on your side of the net.
That'll be a little difficult, Gretchen.
Now, David,
you know the rules of the game.
Okay, I'll serve.
Sabrina.
Yes, Father?
You won't forget
your passport in the morning?
No, Father.
You know, it's not every girl
that's lucky enough to go to Paris.
I know.
And it's the best cooking school
in the world, Sabrina.
If your mother were alive,
she'd be very happy to know
that you were going there.
After all, she was the best cook
on Long Island.
I'm not telling you that
you have to be a cook as she was
or that I want you
to marry a chauffeur like me,
but you know how I feel about it.
Your mother and I
had a good life together.
We were respected by everyone.
That's as much as anyone can want
in this world.
Don't reach for the moon, child.
No, Father.
Besides, it never hurt a young girl
to learn how to cook, did it, Sabrina?
I'll wake you at 7:00.
The boat goes at noon.
- Good night.
- Good night.
What's going on here?
Fairchild! Fairchild!
Anybody here?
Who's that?
Sabrina, come out of there.
Come on. Come on out of there.
Hello.
- What are you doing here?
- Just checking the spark plugs.
What?
Father was worried 'cause one
of the spark plugs was missing.
I wanted to find out which one it was.
So you started all the motors
and closed all the doors?
I didn't want to disturb anyone.
You might never have
disturbed anyone again.
- Does your father know about this?
- No! I wanted to surprise him.
You'd better get out of here.
Here, now. Now, breathe deep.
That's right. Now deeper.
- What happened?
- You passed out.
I'm all right. You don't have to carry me.
Of all the idiotic things.
Haven't you ever heard
of carbon monoxide?
It kills people.
- It does?
- Certainly.
What do you suppose would have
happened if I hadn't come along?
- I'd have died.
- And fast.
Eight cars! One would've done it.
It's a good thing Mrs. Van Horn
asked me to drive her home.
Mrs. Van Horn? Gretchen's mother?
- Why doesn't she drive her home?
- Because we can't find Gretchen.
- She...
- She what?
Nothing.
All right. The next time you start a car,
make sure you leave the garage
doors open, you understand?
You'd think a chauffeur's daughter
would know better.
Yes, sir.
Yesterday we have learned
the correct way how to boil water.
Today we will learn the correct way
how to crack an egg.
Voilà. An egg.
Now, an egg is not a stone.
It is not made of wood.
It is a living thing. It has a heart.
So when we crack it,
we must not torment it.
We must be merciful
and execute it quickly,
like with the guillotine.
It is done with one hand.
Kindly watch the wrist.
Voilà. One, two, three, crack!
You see? It is all in the wrist.
And now, everybody, take an egg.
One, two, three, crack!
New egg. One, two, three, crack!
Take an egg. Crack!
The wrist. Like a whip. You watch.
One, two, three, crack!
New egg. One, two, three, crack!
New egg. One, two...
"Dear Father,
or cherpapa, as we say over here,
"isn't my French getting good?
"Well, we finally finished
our four-week course in sauces,
"and thank goodness.
"I thought soups were tough,
but sauces just about killed me.
"I almost flunked my hollandaise.
It kept separating on me."
Too much vinegar.
Does she mention David?
It's Mr. Linus, Tom.
He's ready to go into town.
What about David?
What does she say about David?
- Not a word.
- That's good.
Wait a minute. Here's something.
"I didn't think of David
very much any more."
That's good.
- "Except at night."
- That's bad.
"I decided to be sensible the other day
and tore up David's picture."
That's good.
"Could you please air-mail me
some Scotch tape?"
That's bad.
- Good morning, Fairchild.
- Good morning, sir.
A beautiful day, sir.
All right, take the parkway,
two windows open, 35 miles an hour.
Yes, sir.
- Morning, Linus. Where are you off to?
- The office. Where do you think?
- The office? On Sunday?
- Today is Wednesday.
Wednesday?
This is KL-75263.
Get me Bowling Green-91099.
Good morning, Miss McCardle.
How did the market open?
Industrials, 247.63, up $1.10.
Rails, 94.7, up 58 cents.
Utilities, 47.23, off 11 cents.
I'm just leaving the house.
You can put the coffee on
in 45 minutes.
Interoffice memo,
Linus Larrabee to David Larrabee.
Dear David, this is to remind you
that you're a junior partner
of Larrabee Industries.
Our building is located
at 30 Broad Street, New York City.
Your office is on the 22nd Floor.
Our normal week
is Monday through Friday.
Our working day is 9:00 to 5:00.
Should you find this inconvenient,
you're free to retire under
the Larrabee Pension Plan.
Having been with us one year,
this will entitle you to 65 cents a month
for the rest of your life.
What do you hear
from your daughter, Fairchild?
- She still loves him.
- I beg your pardon?
I mean,
she loves the cooking school, sir.
But she'll get over it.
And now, mesdames et messieurs,
soon we will see
how you have learned
the lesson of the soufflé.
The soufflé, it must be gay. Gay,
like two butterflies dancing the waltz
in the summer breeze.
Very well.
You have five seconds,
four seconds, three seconds,
two seconds, one second!
To the ovens!
Too low.
Too pale.
Too heavy.
Too low.
Too high. You are exaggerating.
Fair.
So-so.
Sloppy.
Superb!
My dear Baron,
you have not lost your touch.
Much too low.
- I didn't know what happened.
- I will tell you what happened.
You forgot to turn on the oven.
I've been watching you for a long time,
mademoiselle.
Your mind has not been on the cooking.
Your mind has been elsewhere.
You're in love.
And I will venture to go a step further,
you are unhappily in love.
- Does it show?
- Very clearly.
A woman happily in love,
she burns the soufflé.
A woman unhappily in love,
she forgets to turn on the oven.
- Am I correct?
- Yes.
- But I'm trying to get over it.
- Why try to get over it?
You speak of love
like it was a bad cough.
He doesn't even know I exist.
I might as well
be reaching for the moon.
The moon?
You young people,
you are so old-fashioned.
Have you not heard?
We are building rockets
to reach the moon.
To begin with,
you must stop looking like a horse.
Horse?
"His name is the Baron St. Fontanel."
Baron?
"He came to the cooking school
to take a refresher course in soufflés
"and liked me so much
he decided to stay on for the fish."
What about David?
What does she say about David?
David? She's got a baron.
"The baron is 74 years old
and very sweet and very wise.
"He has a box at the opera,
a racing stable,
"wonderful paintings
and his own vineyards.
"Tomorrow night he is taking me
to a very fashionable charity ball,
"and I have an evening dress
just for the occasion.
"If David could only see me in it,
"yards of skirt
and way off the shoulders."
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.
- What's going on here?
- A letter from Sabrina, sir.
Wouldn't you like to read it, Mr. David?
There's something about you in it.
- Poor Sabrina.
- What's the matter with him anyway?
He's getting married again,
that's what's the matter with him.
- He is?
- Number four.
- Who says so?
- Cholly Knickerbocker.
Don't you people
ever read the society columns?
Is he in? Is my brother in?
Yes, he is, Mr. David,
but he's very busy.
I want to see him.
- Well, how about 3:30 this afternoon?
- I want to see him now!
I'm sorry, Mr. David. I have my orders.
He's working with the lawyers
on the plastics deal.
Miss McCardle,
are you gonna press that button,
or do I have to take you up in my arms
and break that door down
using you as a battering ram?
- Mr. David!
- Make up your mind.
Linus, I want to talk to you.
Ask Miss McCardle for an appointment.
Don't give me that
appointment business.
- I'm mad! I'm really steamed!
- All right, gentlemen, I'll be 10 minutes.
Now, what's the trouble?
- How did this get in the paper?
- What?
"It looks like wedding bells
for David Larrabee again.
"The girl is Elizabeth Tyson
of the Oyster Bay Tysons."
- Congratulations.
- Did you plant this?
Me? I thought it was
common knowledge
about you and Elizabeth Tyson.
- You like her, don't you?
- I like her a lot.
- Well?
- I like a lot of girls a lot.
You can say that again.
What are you going to do with that gun?
Put that thing away, Linus.
Look at that.
Greatest plastic ever made.
Not a scratch on it.
Say, I wonder how this would stand up
against a bazooka.
Miss McCardle, get General Stanton
on Governors Island
- and ask if we can borrow a bazooka.
- Yes, Mr. Larrabee.
To get back to my problem,
if you don't mind.
- Lend me your lighter.
- Get this straight, Linus.
I have no intention
of marrying Elizabeth Tyson.
Doesn't burn. Doesn't scorch.
Doesn't melt. How about that?
Look, Linus, I've been married before.
I've had it. I've had it three times.
But this is the first time
the family approves,
because for once
you're gonna settle down
and do something constructive. Taste it.
What's so constructive
about marrying Elizabeth Tyson?
Taste it.
- It's sweet.
- That's right. It's made of sugar cane.
Sugar cane.
Wait a minute. This wouldn't have
anything to do with the fact
that the Tysons own
the largest holdings
of sugar cane in Puerto Rico, would it?
Second-largest.
The largest have no daughter.
It's all beginning to make sense.
Mr. Tyson owns the sugar cane,
you own the formula for the plastics,
and I'm supposed to be offered up
as a human sacrifice
on the altar of industrial progress,
is that it?
You make it sound so vulgar, David.
As if the son of the hot dog dynasty
were being offered in marriage
to the daughter of the mustard king.
Surely you don't object to Elizabeth
just because her father
happens to have $20 million.
That's very
narrow-minded of you, David.
Just one thing you overlooked.
I haven't proposed,
and she hasn't accepted.
Don't worry. I proposed
and Mr. Tyson accepted.
- Did you kiss him?
- Now, look, David.
Elizabeth is one of
the loveliest girls around.
Sooner or later
you're going to propose to her anyway.
I'm only trying to help you
make up your mind.
- Then why don't you marry her?
- Me?
What's so funny?
You want to die an old maid?
I was just thinking
that if I were ever to get married,
I'd have to take a Dictaphone,
two secretaries
and four corporation counselors
along on the honeymoon.
I'd be unfaithful to my wife
every night of my married life
with vice presidents, boards
of directors, slide-rule accountants.
This is my home.
No wife would ever understand it.
Well, neither can I.
You've got all the money in the world.
What's money got to do with it?
If making money
were all there was to business,
it'd hardly be worthwhile
going to the office.
Money is the by-product.
- What's the main objective, power?
- That's become a dirty word.
Well, then, what's the urge?
You're going into plastics now.
What will that prove?
Prove? Nothing much.
A new product has been found,
something of use to the world,
and so a new industry
moves into an undeveloped area.
Factories go up,
machines are brought in,
a harbor is dug,
and you're in business.
It's purely coincidental, of course,
that people who never saw
a dime before suddenly have a dollar
and barefooted kids wear shoes
and have their teeth fixed
and their faces washed.
What's wrong with the kind of an urge
that gives people libraries,
hospitals, baseball diamonds
and movies on a Saturday night?
Miss McCardle,
will you send in the secretaries?
Yes, Mr. Larrabee.
Now you make me feel like a heel.
If I don't marry Elizabeth,
some kid's going to be
running around Puerto Rico barefoot
- with cavities in his teeth.
- Look at this stuff.
You'll fly in a plane made of it,
you'll wear a suit made of it,
and before we're through with it,
you'll probably be able to eat it.
We're organizing Larrabee Plastics.
Larrabee Construction
is ready with the blueprints.
Larrabee Shipping has bought nine
more freighters to handle the traffic.
You mean
the wheels are in motion already?
That's exactly what I mean.
Would you mind demonstrating
the weight test to Mr. David, please?
- Linus, I'll take your word for it.
- Up you go.
- Now, wait a minute.
- I want you to see how resilient it is.
Bounce, please, ladies.
Some plastic, eh?
We're planning on a summer wedding
so we can get in
on this year's sugar crop.
Yeah.
I think you're going to be
very happy, David.
Dearest Father,
we shall be graduating next week,
and I shall be getting my diploma.
I want to thank you now
for the two most
wonderful years of my life.
I shall always love you
for sending me here.
It is late at night,
and someone across the way
is playing La Vie en Rose.
It is the French way of saying,
"I am looking at the world
through rose-colored glasses,"
and it says everything I feel.
I have learned so many things, Father,
not just how to make vichyssoise
or calf's head with sauce vinaigrette,
but a much more important recipe.
I have learned how to live,
how to be in the world and of the world,
and not just to stand aside and watch.
And I will never, never again
run away from life
or from love, either.
I am taking the plane home
on Friday, Father.
You needn't pick me up at the airport.
I'll just take the Long Island railroad,
and you can meet me at the train,
the 4:15.
If you should have any difficulty
recognizing your daughter,
I shall be the most sophisticated woman
at the Glen Cove Station.
Taxi, miss?
Cheapest rates in Glen Cove.
- Well, hello. How are you?
- Well, I'm fine. How are you?
And, I might add, who are you?
- Who am I?
- Am I supposed to know?
Come to think of it,
no, you're not supposed to know.
Are you stranded?
My father was supposed to pick me up,
but something must've happened.
Whoever your father is
and whatever happened,
I'll be eternally grateful,
that is if I can give you a lift.
You certainly can.
You can drive me home.
Good. I'll get your bags.
- Where do you live?
- Dosoris Lane.
Dosoris Lane? Say, that's where I live.
- Really?
- Sure.
We must be neighbors.
And if there's one thing I believe in,
it's love thy neighbor.
So do I.
Come on, David.
- David? Is his name David?
- Yes, it is.
That's funny. My name's David, too.
That is funny, isn't it?
Are you sure
you don't want to tell me your name?
Positive. I'm having much too much fun.
All right, if you want to play games,
have you always
lived here in Long Island?
Most of my life.
I could've sworn I knew
every pretty girl on the North Shore.
I could've sworn
you took in more territory than that.
This is maddening.
I know I've seen that face before.
Let me see your profile again.
I know I know you.
I have a feeling I've seen you
with your father.
Wait a minute.
Is your father Admiral Starratt?
Hardly.
It's funny.
I keep seeing him in a uniform.
Come on, give us a hint.
What does your father do?
- He's in transportation.
- Transportation?
- Railroads. New York Central.
- No.
- Planes. TWA.
- No.
- Boats. United States Lines.
- No.
- I pass.
- Automobiles.
Chrysler.
Yes, Chrysler and Ford
and General Motors and Rolls-Royce.
Is your father on the board of directors
of all those companies?
Well, you might say he runs things.
- I bet my brother Linus knows him.
- He certainly does.
As a matter of fact,
they quite often drive into town together.
- They do?
- Straight through to the garage, please.
- I feel so stupid, I could kill myself.
- You'll be all right in a minute.
Here we are.
Now, look,
I'm not just pulling that old line
of, "Haven't we met somewhere
before?" We have met...
- You don't live here.
- Yes, I do.
- I live here.
- Hi, neighbor.
Sabrina!
Sabrina. Oh, Brina, Brina.
Hello, Margaret.
It's so good to be home.
Look at you. You're such a lady.
You've come home
such a beautiful lady.
- Oh, and Charles!
- Welcome home, Sabrina.
Ernest, Jenny, how are you?
Don't cry, Margaret.
It's nothing to cry about.
I bought you a hat, Margaret.
A real Paris hat
for you to wear to church on Sundays.
And, Jenny, I've got something for you.
Father!
I'm sorry I missed you, Sabrina,
but I had to take
Mrs. Larrabee to the hairdresser.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
Well, I wouldn't have
recognized you anyway.
Well, David had a little trouble,
didn't you, David?
Yes. Yes, I did.
I'll put some coffee on.
Will you come to the kitchen, Sabrina?
As soon as
I've opened my bags, Margaret.
Let's get them out of the car,
and I'll take them upstairs.
Look, as old neighbors,
I think the two of us
should have a reunion.
- It's only fair.
- How about tonight?
- Do you really want to see me?
- Very much.
- Sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
- All right.
- Good. We'll go out on the town.
We'll drive to New York,
have a quick drink at the Stork,
then go somewhere for dinner.
I know a wonderful little
French restaurant over on First Avenue.
I guess you wouldn't
think so much of it after Paris.
- I'll love it.
- Then we'll go dancing someplace,
and when they
throw us out of El Morocco,
we'll mosey on down to the Village.
- You like Dixieland bands?
- Yes.
I know the greatest. It's...
Wait a minute. I completely forgot.
We're having a big party
at the house here tonight.
- With an orchestra and dancing?
- Yes.
But that'll be even more fun.
I didn't know. A lot of dull people around.
Family stuff, you know.
Well, I don't mind, David,
as long as you're there.
- Sabrina.
- In a minute, Father.
And I have a lovely evening dress with
yards of skirt and way off the shoulder.
- Shall I wear it?
- Why, yes, of course.
David, this couldn't be nicer.
A homecoming party.
I'll get the dress out and press it.
See you tonight.
Hello, Linus. I'm back.
It's Sabrina. Isn't it amazing?
Would you have recognized her,
that scrawny little kid
who used to whip around corners
every time she saw us coming,
her knees always painted
with Mercurochrome?
- How do you like those legs now?
- David.
- Aren't they something?
- David!
The last pair of legs
that were something
cost the family $25,000.
Wait till you see
what I brought you from Paris.
Sabrina, I know I should have
mentioned it in my last letter...
- Here we are. Do you like it?
- ...but I didn't want to upset you.
And here. Aren't they gaudy?
Sabrina, David is engaged.
He's getting married again.
I know. Margaret wrote me.
Real Napoleon brandy.
And this is for you
to wear on your day off.
Then you don't care?
Not too much.
After all, he's not married yet.
I didn't like that.
I didn't like the sound of it.
But don't you see, Father?
Everything has changed.
Nothing has changed.
He's still David Larrabee,
and you're still the chauffeur's daughter,
and you're still reaching for the moon.
No, Father.
The moon's reaching for me.
I wish the wedding
were tomorrow, David.
- Don't you?
- Yes, dear.
Ten more days.
It'll seem more like 10 years.
Yes, dear.
Father planned for us to fly to Honolulu
right after the reception,
but I said definitely not.
I certainly don't want to spend
the first 18 hours of my honeymoon
in a plane, sitting up. Do you?
- Yes, dear.
- David!
What? I mean no.
I mean, what did you say?
- Darling, aren't you interested?
- Of course, dear.
- Aren't they a sweet couple?
- Charming. Elizabeth's a lovely girl.
I wish young men would stop wearing
white jackets in the evening.
They look like barbers.
- Now, Oliver.
- My throat's dry.
Have you been smoking?
Maude, I stopped smoking
three months ago.
I find it rather sad
that after 48 years of marriage
distrust should
creep into our relationship.
I'll join the men in the library.
David.
I think I ought to have
a talk with your chauffeur.
- Our chauffeur? What for?
- Well, Father wants to give me
either a Bentley
or a Mercedes as a present,
and I thought your chauffeur
would be able to tell me...
Sure. Sure. Of course.
- What's his name?
- Sabrina. I mean, Fairchild.
I'll talk to him, Elizabeth. Don't bother.
All right, darling.
I know you'll take care of everything.
What is it, David?
Would you like to go
and get something to eat?
No, thank you, darling.
- A drink?
- No.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No, it's my fault. I didn't see you.
- Will it wash out, Elizabeth?
- Yes. It isn't bad.
Well, you'd better go
and do it right now, huh?
- Come on, Elizabeth, I'll help you.
- All right.
Sabrina.
David.
- Hello.
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you. I'm a bit late.
- I worried.
Were you afraid
I'd forgotten the address?
It crossed my mind.
- Shall we dance?
- Right here?
- Who is that girl?
- I didn't know.
I wonder what happened to Elizabeth.
- What a lovely party.
- It is now.
The nicest one you've ever had,
and I've been to all your parties.
- You have?
- Standing right up there in that tree.
Sabrina, if I'd only known.
Sabrina, Sabrina,
where have you been all my life?
- Right over the garage.
- Right over my car. Right up in that tree.
What a fool I was.
And what a crush I had on you.
It's not too late, is it?
I didn't know, David. Is it?
You should see her!
You should see Sabrina!
The prettiest girl, the prettiest dress,
the best dancer, the belle of the ball.
And such poise,
as though she belonged up there.
- I didn't like it.
- Who's she dancing with, David?
That's right.
And he's holding her so close,
I didn't see
how the poor girl can breathe.
And the way they look
into each other's eyes...
I didn't like it.
Tom, you ought to be happy for her.
This is what she wanted.
This is where she belongs.
No, it's not, and it's not where I belong.
Remember the chauffeur
on the Harrington estate?
His daughter fell in love
with the son of the house,
and the first thing he knew
he was driving the family to the church,
changing his uniform, and walking
down the aisle to give the bride away.
- That's not for me. I don't like it.
- Tom, that was 25 years ago.
Come on, let's sneak up and see her.
David.
Hello, Mother.
David, I don't believe
I know this young lady.
- Yes, you do.
- Good evening, Mrs. Larrabee.
Mother, this is Miss Fairchild.
- Sabrina?
- Yes, of course.
- Yes, of course!
- Of course. Sabrina.
You didn't recognize me, did you?
Have I changed? Have I really changed?
You certainly have.
- You look lovely, Sabrina.
- Doesn't she, though?
I thought it would be fun
to ask her to the party,
you know, kind of a welcome home.
Well, David's been just wonderful,
Mrs. Larrabee.
- He met me at the station.
- Did he? How nice of him.
- Yes. She's been to Paris, you know.
- Yes, I know.
You must come over sometime
and cook something
very special for us, Sabrina.
- I want to see what you've learned.
- I've learned a lot.
Bye.
David, this is such fun.
So much more fun
than just watching from that tree.
I'm so glad
you came back home, Sabrina.
I'll never let you go away again.
- Never?
- Never.
David, would you like to kiss me?
- Would I?
- Yes. A nice steady kiss.
- Not on roller skates this time.
- Roller skates?
You don't remember.
Well, I remember
I had a pair of roller skates.
I was 9 years old,
and you had your arms around me
because you were teaching me
to skate backwards,
and suddenly you kissed me.
I've never forgotten.
- Sabrina, let's get out of here.
- Yes, let's.
I'll tell you what. You slip away first,
and then I'll meet you at...
- The indoor tennis court.
- Yes.
- And you'll bring champagne.
- Of course.
You saw an awful lot from that tree,
didn't you?
And will you have the orchestra play
Isn't It Romantic?
Naturally.
What's happened to David?
He's being a good host,
but I'll get him out of circulation.
Thank you.
Have you got a minute, David?
- Not right now.
- The old man wants to see you.
- Later. I'm busy.
- You better come along.
He's frothing at the mouth.
- What about?
- You guess.
- Animal, vegetable or mineral?
- Definitely animal.
I'm telling you, Linus, this boy
should be drummed out of the family!
What have I done now, Father?
I'm not saying
that all Larrabees have been saints.
There was a Thomas Larrabee
who was hung for piracy,
and there was a Benjamin Larrabee
who was a slave trader,
and it was my great-great-uncle
Joshua Larrabee
who was shot in Indiana
while attempting to rob a train.
But there never was a Larrabee
who behaved as David Larrabee
has behaved here tonight!
- Exactly what have I done?
- What have you done?
Father, remember
your basal metabolism.
No gentleman makes love to a servant
in his mother's house.
- She is not a servant.
- She's a servant's daughter.
And in behaving as you have
you've embarrassed not only
your mother, but also our chauffeur.
I've too much respect for Fairchild
ever to intrude on his personal life,
and I expect you to have
the same respect for his daughter.
I have so much respect for his daughter
I invited her to the party!
- That's overdoing it.
- I love her!
He loves her.
Next thing we know, he'll lean
a ladder up against the garage wall
and elope with the girl
in the middle of the night.
Maybe!
I'll overlook for the moment
the fact that you're an engaged man
and merely remind you
of your marital record to date.
I know, Father.
I've made three mistakes.
First, that Hungarian countess
who only married you
to bring her family over,
her mother, her father and five brothers,
all of them badly in need
of costly dental repairs.
- Do we have to go through that again?
- Then that Twyman girl!
Her family 50 years
on the Social Register,
and she has the audacity
to wear on her wedding dress
not a corsage,
- but a Stevenson button!
- Father, you promised not to swear.
Then that great actress,
turns out all she does
is commercials on television
for an underarm deodorant!
And now our chauffeur's daughter!
Father, are you through?
Because there's someone waiting.
I'm not through,
and I'm sure that your brother, Linus,
has a few words to say.
Yes, I do, but I'm not so sure
you're going to like them, Father.
I think you're being
a little unfair to David.
I'm what?
Well, I think David's old enough
to live his own life.
If he decides Sabrina's the girl for him...
Nonsense!
- Linus, you really mean that?
- Well, of course I mean it.
But it would knock your plans for a loop.
What plans? The plastics merger?
Forget it.
If you love her, take her.
This is the 20th century.
Twentieth century? I could pick
a century out of a hat blindfolded
and get a better one!
You'll get rid of that girl immediately,
do you understand?
And you'll apologise to your fiancée!
Now, Father, don't push him.
Let's discuss this like civilized people.
- Sit down, David.
- Thank you, Linus.
Look, I really have to go.
Suppose you two work it out.
You want me to help you or don't you?
Of course, Linus.
I appreciate what you're doing.
Then sit down!
Linus, you're the only one in this family
who understands...
Oh, no! No.
- What is it? What happened?
- Champagne glasses. I sat on them.
- On the chair?
- No, in my pocket!
Sabrina?
Hello.
You did order champagne, didn't you?
- What are you doing here?
- David sent me.
- Isn't he coming?
- No. I don't think he'll be able to make it.
- What happened?
- He got stuck.
Stuck?
Nothing serious.
Just one of those things.
Shall I serve it up there,
or will you come down?
- Up there? All right.
- No. I'll come down.
We do meet under the most
peculiar circumstances, Sabrina.
Either you're under eight cars
looking for a missing spark plug,
or you're perched up here,
umpiring a tennis match
between two players who aren't there.
You look lovely, Sabrina,
and very grown-up.
- I'd better get back to the party.
- And leave me here alone?
What did David say?
I didn't know what you did to him,
but I haven't seen him in such a state
since he was kicked in the head
by a polo pony at Old Westbury.
- That's nice.
- Amnesia has definitely set in.
He's completely forgotten he's engaged.
He wants you.
And I want him.
I've been in love with him all my life.
Well, there goes the engagement.
- You don't object?
- Object? To you?
It's as though
a window had been thrown open
and a lovely breeze
swept through this stuffy old house.
How could I object?
Even though the breeze comes from
the general direction of the garage?
- This is the 20th century, Sabrina.
- Thank you. Let's drink to that.
I'm sorry it isn't David here
instead of me, but it's all in the family.
You know,
when you just walked in here,
I was sure you'd been sent
by the family to deal with me.
- To deal with you?
- Like in a Viennese operetta,
the young prince falls in love
with the waitress at the rathskeller,
and the prime minister
is sent to buy her off.
- Buy her off?
- Yes.
He offers her 5,000 kroner.
"No," she says.
"10,000?" "No."
- 15,000 kroner?
- No.
- 25,000 kroner?
- No.
- $25,000.
- No.
How did dollars get into this?
$25,000 after taxes.
That's a lot of money, Sabrina.
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm just trying to make it worthwhile.
What's a krone these days?
No self-respecting prime minister
would offer kroner.
No self-respecting waitress
would take dollars.
Good girl.
Hey, how does this operetta end?
- What's the last act?
- I didn't know.
I guess they run away to America
on a zeppelin
with everybody singing like mad.
- They open a brewery in Milwaukee.
- Yes.
The love that made Milwaukee famous.
There it is.
The song they were playing
the night before I went away.
David was right here
dancing it with somebody else.
Tonight I wanted it to be me.
It's all in the family.
How are we going to make sure that
all the fragments have been removed?
Very simple. We will reconstruct
the two champagne glasses.
Now, I cannot possibly be hurting you.
The area has been
completely anesthetized.
It's not you. It's that song!
Sabrina.
If David were here now,
you'd expect him to kiss you,
wouldn't you?
Here's a kiss from David.
It's all in the family.
- Come in.
- Hi.
- How do you feel?
- I never felt better in my life.
No, you look fine.
The anesthetic worn off?
I guess it has.
Well, I brought you a present.
What happened
on the tennis court last night?
Was Sabrina mad
because I didn't show up?
- Not mad, just disappointed.
- Poor kid. What did you tell her?
The truth. That the family objected
to her, but you stood up like a man...
- Good.
- ...and sat down like a jerk.
Twenty-three stitches.
Here. This ought to
make you feel better.
A plastic hammock?
With a trap door. Designed it myself.
- Ran it off at the factory this morning.
- On Sunday?
But why not? You were in pain,
so I had them open up the plant.
What a brother.
All right. Let's try it on for size.
Come on. On your feet.
I'll never drink champagne again
as long as I live.
- What did you think of Sabrina?
- Wonderful girl.
- Were you nice to her?
- As nice as I could be.
What a brother.
I've been trying to write a poem to her,
but I can't seem to finish it.
- What rhymes with glass?
- Glass...
Glass...
- Alas.
- Of course.
Right on the nose.
- Linus!
- Sorry, David.
If Sabrina were only here.
Hey, how about
smuggling her up in the dumbwaiter?
That would be dumb.
What if Father sees her?
Yeah, that's right. We wouldn't want to
do anything to spoil it, would we?
No, we sure wouldn't.
- Linus, will you do me a favor?
- Anytime.
I know how these things bore you,
but would you mind
keeping an eye on Sabrina for me?
I've already thought of that.
As a matter of fact,
I'm taking her sailing this afternoon.
- Sailing?
- In your boat.
Honest? Oh, Sabrina.
Tell her we'll be off, just the two of us,
the moment Dr. Calaway
takes the stitches out.
Well, then,
you've already made up your mind.
Absolutely. This is it!
Yes, well, I...
I just wanted to make sure,
because this has been it
three times before.
I was blind, that's why. It's been
Sabrina and I since we were kids.
I just couldn't see her for the tree.
And what about Elizabeth?
What about Father and Mother?
So what about them?
Elizabeth will be so broken up,
she'll go out and buy three new hats.
Mother will go to bed with a severe
headache and the latest Mickey Spillane
and Father will take to the bottle openly
and smoke six Corona Coronas
and then threaten to exile me
to Larrabee Copper in Butte, Montana,
- and that's where you come in, Linus.
- How?
I didn't want to go to Butte, Montana.
You're going to help me, aren't you?
Yes. Yes. I'm going to help you.
- Aren't I?
- What a brother.
How's my poor darling?
I brought you six books, dear,
and a game of Scrabble.
Scrabble? I'm in no condition
to play Scrabble.
Don't be silly.
That's all you are in a condition to play.
I still didn't understand what those
glasses were doing in your pockets.
I was taking them down to the tennis
court. There was somebody waiting.
There was a game going on.
In the dark? In the middle of the night?
Yes. That's why he needed the glasses.
Yes. That's why I needed the glasses.
- Shall we play three-handed?
- No, thanks.
- I've got to go sailing.
- Yes, he's got to go sailing.
And no more false moves now,
not until those stitches are out.
Yes, Linus.
We don't want any complications
to set in, do we?
So long, Elizabeth. So long, Scarface.
- Good afternoon, Father.
- I thought it was your mother.
I didn't mind you smoking in my room,
but not in my clothes closet.
It's good for the moths.
Now, then, Linus,
what about that girl over the garage?
David wants to run off with her.
That's nice,
with the chauffeur's daughter.
I didn't care if he runs off
with the gardener's grandmother!
I just don't want him to run off
with the plastics merger.
I have a very simple solution,
we'll fire Fairchild.
Not after 25 years, Father.
All right, then,
we'll write her a nice little check
and tell her to forget about David.
She doesn't want money.
She wants love.
- I thought they discontinued that model.
- The last of the romantics.
Why does she have to pick on David?
Why can't she be in love
with someone else?
We will do our best.
- Is that the idea?
- Yep.
- You've got someone in mind for her?
- Yep.
Who?
Boola, boola
Boola, boola
Boola, boola...
- Oh, no!
- What's the matter?
Not you, Linus!
Look, do you think
this is any fun for me?
I've got a whole desk full of work I was
planning to clean up over the weekend,
I'm supposed to be in Texas
on the sulfur deal,
the whole Puerto Rican operation has
to be set in motion in the next 48 hours,
and here I am going off in a sailboat
to make an ass out of myself
with a girl 22.
Look at me.
Joe College with a touch of arthritis.
Could you use this
for sailing into the sunset?
I wish I were dead with my back broken.
Just a thought.
Hey, music might help.
Seems to me I had a portable
phonograph from my freshman days.
I only hope
you remember what to do with a girl.
It'll come back to me.
It's like riding a bicycle.
This is a very unusual song.
Is it popular?
Oh, yes.
- Wonder why I never heard it before.
- You've been in Paris for two years.
Yes, we have no bananas
We have no bananas today
How did they ever think of those words?
Oh, they are clever, aren't they?
- May I play another?
- Of course.
- You need dusting.
- I beg your pardon?
- I didn't mean you, Linus.
- Thank you.
How's David?
Well, he's been flat on his stomach,
but he's feeling better, thank you.
Now he's flat on his back.
I miss him.
Not that I'm not having a good time.
- Sabrina.
- Yes?
- You mind if we turned this off?
- Why?
- Because...
- Don't you like it?
I used to like it.
Certain songs bring back
sudden memories to me, too.
Did you love her?
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- I'm sorry.
That's all right.
So strange to think of you
being touched by a woman.
- I always thought you walked alone.
- No man walks alone from choice.
As a child, I used to watch you
from the window over the garage,
coming and going,
always wearing your black homburg
and carrying a briefcase
and an umbrella.
I thought you could never belong
to anyone, never care for anyone.
Yes, the cold businessman
behind his marble desk
way up in his executive suite.
No emotion, just ice water in his veins
and ticker tape coming from his heart.
And yet, one day,
that same cold businessman,
high up in a skyscraper, opens
a window and steps out on a ledge,
stands there for three hours, wondering
- if he should jump.
- Because of her?
No. No, that was another woman.
Sabrina, do you find it hard to believe
that someone might want to
blot out everything
for sentimental reasons?
I believe it.
You know what I almost did
because of sentimental reasons? I...
I went to Paris to blot it out.
- Maybe you should go to Paris, Linus.
- To Paris?
It helped me a lot.
Have you ever been there?
Yes. Yes. Once.
I was there for 35 minutes.
- Thirty-five minutes?
- Changing planes.
I was on my way to Iraq on an oil deal.
But Paris isn't for changing planes.
It's for changing your outlook,
for throwing open the windows
and letting in...
Letting in la vie en rose.
Paris is for lovers. Maybe that's
why I stayed only 35 minutes.
Hi, David. Hello, Father.
Margaret has some dinner for you
in the kitchen, Sabrina.
Funny, I used to be so afraid of him.
Aren't you hungry?
Father, you've driven Linus
for so many years.
What do you know about him?
A chauffeur is supposed to
keep his eyes on the road, Sabrina.
Only once in a while does he get
a glimpse in the rear-view mirror.
If you looked a little longer, Father,
you'd find him rather nice
and quite human.
We have no bananas
Today
Good morning, Miss McCardle.
First, a wire to Hannegan,
Fort Worth, Texas.
Unable to attend
Larrabee Sulfur board meeting
because of slight hitch
Larrabee Plastics merger. Got that?
Next. Here's the itinerary for tonight.
I want two tickets to
The Seven Year Itch,
table for two at the Colony
before the show,
a table for two at the Persian Room
after the show.
Make it a corner table, a dark corner.
I'm just passing La Guardia Field.
You can put the coffee on
in 10 minutes. Make it strong.
- Fairchild, I'll be needing you tonight.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm taking Sabrina out again.
- Yes, sir.
- Will you have her at my office at 7:00?
- Yes, sir.
Anything wrong, Fairchild?
I would very much prefer that
you dispense with my services
on these dates with my daughter, sir.
It makes for a rather awkward situation.
I see. Well, that never occurred to me.
I'm sorry.
It's just not right, sir.
I like to think of life as a limousine.
Though we're all driving together,
we must remember our places.
There's a front seat and a back seat
and a window in between.
Fairchild, I never realised it before,
but you're a terrible snob.
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
Have her take one of the other cars
and drive in herself.
- Have her take David's car.
- Thank you, sir.
It's all so distressing.
First Mr. David, now you.
I wish Sabrina
would have stayed in Paris.
So do I.
May I ask, sir,
what exactly are your intentions?
My intentions? Unethical,
reprehensible, but very practical.
Beg pardon?
With your permission, Fairchild, I'm
shipping your daughter back to Paris.
- You are, sir?
- That is,
I'm going to try to ship her back.
- May I ask how, sir?
- First class, of course.
And I don't want you
to worry about money.
It's not money I'm worried about, sir.
It's Sabrina.
- I just don't want her to get hurt.
- I'll be as gentle as I can.
I hope so, sir.
She's just a displaced person,
I'm afraid.
She doesn't belong in a mansion,
but then again, she doesn't belong
above a garage, either.
All right.
The meeting of the board of directors
of the Larrabee Industries
will now come to order.
As the chairman of the board,
I would like to say at the outset...
The chairman is so dizzy.
Meeting adjourned.
Have a frozen daiquiri.
I once saw an office like this
in an old copy
of Fortune magazine at my dentist's.
- Has David got an office like this?
- Something like this, only larger.
- Larger?
- Yes.
Instead of a desk,
he has a putting green.
Please, Sabrina,
before my fingers get frostbitten.
- Is this the ledge?
- What ledge?
You know, the ledge,
that woman, when you almost...
The ledge.
Yes.
- Yes, that's the ledge all right.
- What made you not do it?
There were some children
playing hopscotch on the sidewalk.
I'm very fond of those children.
Look at all these gadgets.
Just imagine,
you press a button and factories go up,
or you pick up a telephone
and 100 tankers set out for Persia,
or you switch on the Dictaphone
and say,
"Buy all of Cleveland
and move it to Pittsburgh."
- You must be awfully clever.
- It's nothing, really.
Just a small knack,
like juggling three oranges.
It isn't oranges. It's millions.
- Suppose you dropped one?
- Suppose I did.
What's at the end of a million?
Zero, zero, zero. Nothing.
A circle with a hole in it.
- Sabrina.
- Yes, Linus?
- Can you keep a secret?
- Secret?
Yes, of course you can.
I want you to look out there, uptown.
- You see the French Line pier?
- Yes.
- You see the boat?
- Yes.
That's the Liberté. It sails on Thursday.
I'm going to be on it.
- You are?
- Yes, I am.
I'm sick of pushing buttons,
sick of secretaries, sick of this office.
I'm breaking out of here, Sabrina.
I'm running away.
- Good for you.
- I've been thinking about Paris
ever since you mentioned it.
It's all your fault, Sabrina.
It'll make a new person out of you,
I guarantee or double your money back.
Linus, I'm so glad you're going.
Or am I?
It's 7:35, Mr. Larrabee. You have
a dinner reservation at the Colony.
Thank you.
- Ready, Sabrina?
- Tout de suite, as they say in Paris.
Curtain is at 8:40.
I used your brother's name
at the Colony.
I got you the darkest corner.
I'm sorry, Mr. Larrabee.
This is what you do
on your very first day in Paris.
You get yourself some rain,
not just a drizzle
but honest-to-goodness rain.
Then you find yourself
someone really nice
and drive her through
the Bois de Boulogne in a taxi.
The rain's very important,
because that's when Paris
smells its sweetest.
- It's the damp chestnut trees, you see?
- I see.
You're very clever, Linus, and very rich.
You can order yourself some rain.
Oh, sure. I can order myself some rain.
I can get myself a taxi. That's easy.
But can I find myself
someone really nice?
That's not so easy, Sabrina.
How do you say in French,
"My sister has a yellow pencil"?
How do you say,
"My brother has a lovely girl"?
And how do you say,
"I wish I were my brother"?
Why are you looking at me that way?
All night long, I've had the most terrible
impulse to do something.
Never resist an impulse, Sabrina,
especially if it's terrible.
I'm going to do it.
- There.
- What's that for?
We can't have you walking up and down
the Champs Élysées
looking like a tourist undertaker.
And another thing.
Never a briefcase in Paris
and never an umbrella. There's a law.
How am I ever going to get along
in Paris without someone like you?
Who'll be there to help me
with my French,
to turn down the brim of my hat?
Suppose you meet someone
on the boat, the very first day out,
a perfect stranger.
I have a better suppose, Sabrina.
Suppose I were 10 years younger.
Suppose you weren't in love with David.
Suppose I asked you to...
I suppose I'm just talking nonsense.
I suppose so.
Suppose you sing
that song again. Slowly.
Hi! I thought you two had eloped.
I wouldn't mind, but not in my car.
- Hello, David.
- Did you have a good time?
- So-so.
- Where'd you go?
We saw The Seven Year Itch,
then went on to the Persian Room.
- Lousy dancer, isn't he?
- So-so.
I bet he slept through half the show,
and then bent your ears back
the rest of the evening with
Dow Jones Averages, corporate
structures, excess profits taxes...
We talked about a lot of things.
- How's your little mishap?
- Shaping up beautifully.
Dr. Calaway's so proud of the job,
he wants to show it to his class
at Columbia Medical School.
- I'm sorry, Sabrina.
- It's very funny.
Say, Linus, while I was lying
in that hammock, I got a great idea.
He thinks I'm an idiot.
How does this strike you?
Champagne glasses out of plastic,
just in case.
Brilliant. What else did
Dr. Calaway have to say?
Stitches come out Thursday.
- Thursday?
- I'm a fast healer.
You sure are.
So if you two have
any long-range plans...
Oh, no, nothing long-range.
I just thought Sabrina would like
to see the stock exchange
- and our plant in Jersey.
- I didn't think so.
Well, then we'll just have dinner in town
and go to a show.
But that's all, Brother,
because come Thursday,
the first team takes over.
Hey, what's with the homburg?
Well, I guess the undertaker
better turn in,
and you'd better crawl back
into that hole in your hammock.
- Au revoir, Sabrina.
- Good night, Linus.
He's a little on the dull side, isn't he?
But you can't help liking him.
- Kiss me, David.
- Love to, Sabrina.
Again.
- That's better.
- What's the matter, darling?
You're not worried about us, are you?
Because I'm not.
So there'll be a big stink in the family.
So who cares?
David, I don't think I'm going
to have dinner with Linus.
- I didn't want to go out with him.
- Why not?
I want to be near you.
I know how you feel, Sabrina.
It must be an awful bore.
But if Linus wants to take you out,
let's be nice about it.
It's very important. He's our only ally.
Don't you see?
Father will try to cut off my allowance
and send me off to Larrabee Copper
in Butte, Montana,
and we don't want to go
to Butte, Montana, do we?
Hold me close, David.
We'll have a wonderful time, darling.
We'll build ourselves a raft
and drift across the Pacific,
like Kon Tiki,
or climb the highest mountain,
like Annapurna. Just the two of us.
Keep talking, David. Keep talking.
We thought of pink roses
for the cherubs
and white gardenias for the names.
It'll take about 2,000 gardenias.
We'll float the whole thing in our pool.
- Indoor or outdoor?
- Outdoor, of course.
We drained the water
from the indoor pool
to make room for the wedding presents.
Where's the provision
determining the ratio
of invested capital
to controlling interest?
Page 62, paragraph 6, subdivision B.
- Father, where's the list?
- Here you are, darling.
Would you like to see the invitation list?
516,740 under trust of Illinois, 550...
Who are your lawyers, Linus?
The way this merger's worked out,
I have all the titles
and you have all the control.
I always make it a point
to have controls.
Yeah. It's just your good luck
the kids are so fond of each other.
I always make it a point to be lucky, too.
Come along, Father.
Linus, you won't forget
the gardenias now, will you?
Tony Lennox has the sweetest idea.
He's gonna fly over the chapel
and throw rice at us from his plane.
With David the bridegroom,
maybe he'd better use wild rice.
Oh, Father.
All I can say is
David better show up at this wedding.
I have a horrible vision of Elizabeth
waiting at the altar
and 2,000 gardenias floating
in the pool, spelling disaster.
A memo to Miss McCardle.
First, call Brunson
in Larrabee Shipping.
We'll be needing 2,000 gardenias.
Tell him to start cornering the market.
- Next, I want...
- You're not having any trouble
with that... I never can remember
that garage girl's name.
- Sabrina.
- Sabrina.
What right has a chauffeur got
to call his daughter Sabrina?
What would you suggest, Ethel?
You've been taking her out now
three nights in a row.
Is that situation in hand?
I think so. It's resolving itself
into a straight export deal.
And next, Miss McCardle,
I want two accommodations
on the Liberté, one in the name
of Miss Sabrina Fairchild,
one in my name.
What's this? What's this? You and
that girl going off on a boat together?
Have I spawned two idiot sons?
Who said I was going? She's going
because she'll think that I'm going,
but I'm not really going. Is that clear?
It is not.
I'm going to tell Sabrina
that I'll meet her on the boat.
When the boat is 10 miles out at sea,
she'll find out that I'm not on the boat.
My cabin will be empty,
just a note of apology
and a few presents to soften the blow.
- Excellent.
- Yes. I thought you'd like it.
And, next, Miss McCardle,
I want flowers in Miss Fairchild's cabin.
Candy, fruit
and the usual what-have-yous.
Next, cable Michot to get her
a car in Paris. Also an apartment.
Next, a letter of credit
on our Paris bank.
- She can draw up to 50,000.
- Easy now.
Next, transfer to Thomas Fairchild
1,000 shares Larrabee Common.
One thousand shares?
Make it 1,500 shares,
Larrabee Preferred.
It seems to me there ought to be
a less extravagant way
of getting a chauffeur's daughter
out of one's hair.
How would you do it? You can't even
get a little olive out of a jar.
Eat it!
Going up?
No, thank you.
- Yes?
- Miss Fairchild for you, Mr. Larrabee.
- Send her in.
- She's on the phone. Take it on five.
Sabrina? What happened to you?
It's 8:20.
Good evening, Linus.
I know I'm late. I guess maybe
I should have called you earlier.
I can't see you tonight.
I'm very sorry. I just can't make it.
I tried, but I'm all tied up.
No, I'm not on Long Island.
I'm in New York.
Downtown in a phone booth.
In a building.
What difference does it make
what building, Linus? I...
I can't see you tonight.
All right. It's the Larrabee building,
but I'm not coming up.
Now, look, Sabrina, suppose you
tell me exactly what's on your mind,
slowly and clearly.
You talk, and I'll listen.
Well, you see, it was really David's idea
I go out with you,
because he wants you to help him.
But the trouble is,
it's not helping me any.
I shouldn't have been seeing you, Linus.
I shouldn't even be
talking to you on the phone.
In fact, I'm really only calling
to say goodbye because
tomorrow you'll be on the boat to Paris.
In a way, I'm glad you're going.
You do know what I mean,
don't you, Linus? Linus?
Hello, Linus? Where are you, Linus?
- Your three minutes are up.
- Hello.
Isn't it silly? I was talking to myself.
You wasted a dime, too. Come on.
- You're not angry with me, are you?
- Of course not.
I have a perfectly good reason
why I shouldn't see you tonight.
Not here, Sabrina.
All right, Sabrina,
what is that perfectly good reason
why you shouldn't see me?
What is it? What's bothering you?
It's me that's bothering me.
Please don't.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm not making
much sense, Linus.
Would you like a drink?
- I didn't think I want a drink.
- I think I do.
- Why don't you sit down?
- I can only stay a minute.
- Mind if I turn on just this little one?
- If you want.
I'd hate to fix myself a martini
with crème de menthe.
Yes?
I've canceled your dinner reservation,
Mr. Larrabee.
What about the theater tickets?
I couldn't possibly go anywhere.
They're all yours, Miss McCardle.
Good night.
- Sure you won't have even one?
- No, thanks.
- You must be hungry.
- I hadn't thought about it.
I'm starved. I was sort of
saving myself for 21 tonight.
- I've spoiled your evening, haven't I?
- No, you haven't.
We can have dinner right here. Let's
see what Miss McCardle is hoarding.
Probably maraschino cherries
and stale crackers.
Tomato juice, puffed rice, sardines,
tomato juice, tomato juice, tomato juice.
That's an awful lot of tomato juice.
Suppose you can fix something
out of all this?
I suppose so.
I'm a graduate cook, you know.
I have a diploma.
It'll take a diploma.
I wanted to be so sure
I couldn't go out with you tonight,
and here I am, cooking for you.
I guess maybe
I should have worn an apron.
One apron coming up.
Pots, pans, can opener,
stove, all the comforts of home.
Now, Miss McCardle once cooked
dinner here for the board of directors.
After the first course,
there was a move to adjourn.
It was passed unanimously.
- What do we start with?
- I haven't decided yet.
Now, Sabrina, let's have none of those.
- I'm so ashamed, Linus.
- Well, you have no reason to be.
I've known you only a few days,
just a few days, really,
and I've been in love
with David all my life.
I can't understand
what's the matter with me.
I went away to grow up,
and I thought I had grown up,
but I guess I haven't, really.
I just got myself a new hairdo, that's all.
- Please say something.
- Well, like what?
I didn't know.
Tell me I'm imagining things.
Tell me you never even thought of
taking me on the boat to Paris with you.
Tell me to put on my coat and go home
before I make a complete fool of myself.
But don't let me go home.
I couldn't bear it.
This is the last time
we're going to see each other.
- I'll behave, Linus. I'm all right now.
- That's good.
Now, how about dinner?
I just remembered
I didn't have any lunch today.
- You didn't?
- Or any breakfast, either.
That may account for a lot of things.
- Would you like a soufflé for dessert?
- Out of tomato juice?
- Out of crackers, of course.
- Not too soggy, huh?
You'd better get out of the kitchen.
Which one is the Liberté?
- The one on the right.
- Are you sure?
- You mustn't take the wrong boat.
- I'll try not to.
You haven't forgotten
my instructions, have you?
Never an umbrella in Paris
and under all circumstances,
rain the very first day.
I haven't forgotten a word, Sabrina.
My sister has a yellow pencil.
Very good.
Watch. One, two, three, crack.
New egg. It's all in the wrist.
There must be
an eggbeater somewhere.
Linus.
Linus, why didn't you tell me?
You do want to take me with you,
don't you?
These don't mean
what you think they mean.
I know why you didn't tell me,
because you think it's wrong.
They'll say I'm too young for you,
that it'll be an awful scandal,
and the market will go down.
Linus Larrabee, Esquire,
is taking me to Paris.
Sabrina. I...
I wasn't going to take you to Paris.
I was going to send you.
- Alone?
- Yes. All alone.
- But there's a ticket for you.
- For an empty cabin.
- You were joining me in Paris, is that it?
- I'm afraid not.
- I think I understand.
- I'm sorry.
But why? Why did you do it, Linus?
High finance, expansion,
the marriage, a merger,
a new plaque on the Larrabee building.
You got in the way.
- David?
- That's right.
How inconsiderate of me.
And how inconvenient for you.
Such a busy man having to waste
so much time just to get me on a boat.
I'm ashamed to say
I enjoyed every minute of it.
And I suppose in your empty cabin
there would have been a farewell note
dictated to and typed by Miss McCardle.
- And perhaps a few flowers.
- A little more than that.
A letter of credit,
an apartment in Paris, a car,
1,500 shares of Larrabee Preferred
for your father.
You're very generous.
We regard it as
a necessary business expense.
I'll just take one of those tickets.
I was happy in Paris.
I think you would have been, too.
Good night, Mr. Larrabee.
I'm sorry I can't stay to do the dishes.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Mr. Larrabee?
- Come in, Miss McCardle.
- Good morning.
- Good morning. You're late.
Had to make my own coffee.
Worst ever.
I'm sorry.
I had a very bad night last night.
I know exactly how you feel.
Well, you better get that pad.
We have things to do.
I used your theater tickets
and took my mother.
- You ready?
- Yes.
First, call Larrabee Shipping.
Tell them to radio all our tankers
bound for Puerto Rico to turn back.
Next, call Larrabee Construction,
tell them to stop work on the new plant.
We're canceling
the Larrabee Plastics merger.
We are?
Next, I want Mr. Larrabee, Sr.,
Mr. Tyson and Miss Elizabeth Tyson
here in this office as soon as possible.
Better have a large bottle
of smelling salts around.
- We're calling off the wedding.
- We are?
- When's your mother's birthday?
- Why?
I'm sending her 2,000 gardenias.
Here's a ticket for the Liberté.
Have it transferred to the name
of Mr. David Larrabee.
Better get his passport out
and make sure it's in order.
Next, see if you can locate David.
The boat sails at noon.
I've been calling the house for an hour,
and he isn't there.
Try Dr. Calaway.
Try everywhere, but get him.
Do you still want me to send all those
presents to Miss Fairchild's cabin?
- No. We're sending David instead.
- Good morning.
You'll be happy to hear
the stitches are out.
It's as good as new.
Congratulations.
I've been looking for you.
And I have been looking for you.
You're leaving for Paris today.
It's all arranged.
- No kidding.
- With Sabrina.
She's gonna be on the boat.
- She have to be in here?
- All right, Miss McCardle,
you've got a lot of work to do.
Aren't you pleased with the news?
What's the matter with you?
I saw Sabrina
when she came home last night.
Found her packing.
- And what'd she say?
- Nothing. She just kissed me.
What's wrong with that?
Well, I may know nothing
about Dow Jones Averages,
but I do know something about kisses.
Yes, you could
lecture on that at Vassar.
This one tasted like a goodbye kiss.
- You're just imagining things.
- No. It had a few tears in it.
I'm not very bright.
It took me until this morning
to add two and two together,
like two champagne glasses
and the plastics deal and Sabrina.
- You know what I got?
- What?
Sorry I had to do it
to a tired businessman.
That's all right. Well, now we're even.
Suppose you go on home
and start packing.
I'll take care of Elizabeth.
I'm calling off the merger
at the board meeting.
Miss McCardle will have your passport
and your ticket.
Let her know if you need any money.
I want you and Sabrina
to have a good time in Paris. Goodbye.
What makes you so sure
Sabrina still wants me?
Of course she wants you.
She's wanted you all her life.
Until you came along
in that silly homburg.
Well, suppose you straighten
that silly straw hat and on your way.
- You'll miss the boat.
- Don't worry. I won't miss the boat.
I'm going.
Funniest thing, Linus Larrabee,
the man who doesn't burn,
doesn't scorch, doesn't melt,
suddenly throws
a $20 million deal out the window.
Are you sure
you don't want to go with her?
- Why should I want to go with her?
- Because you're in love with her.
You won't be annoyed
if I cry at the boat, will you, Sabrina?
I'll be disappointed if you don't, Father.
I'd feel so much better
if only you'd be angry with me
for allowing all this to happen.
It wasn't your fault, Father. It was mine.
I should have believed you.
There's a front seat and a back seat.
- And a window in between.
- And a window in between.
If it's any consolation, one good thing
has come out of it anyway.
You did get over David, didn't you?
Dear David. Yes, I did get over that.
I'm cured.
Now how to get over the cure?
It wouldn't have worked out,
really, darling. The papers
and everybody else would have said,
"How fine and democratic
"for a Larrabee to marry
the chauffeur's daughter."
But would they praise
the chauffeur's daughter? No.
Democracy can be
a wickedly unfair thing, Sabrina.
Nobody poor was ever called
democratic for marrying somebody rich.
Why don't we start this meeting
and sign the papers?
- We're waiting for David, of course.
- Yes, we're waiting for David.
That boy has no sense of time,
no sense of direction.
As a matter of fact, he has no sense.
Where is he, Linus?
We'll get to that in a minute.
Here are the smelling salts,
Mr. Larrabee.
I got you the largest size.
Linus, look what I bought him for
Waikiki beach.
I hope they're loud enough.
I hope they're returnable.
Well, gentlemen,
I see no need for any further delay.
Suppose we get down to business.
- But what about David?
- Yes, what about David?
That's a very good question. Not yet.
Tyson, members of the board...
Are you with us, Father?
Present.
As you know, gentlemen,
we are here today to put our signatures
to the Larrabee-Tyson merger.
Much effort has gone into
making this union possible,
long hours,
many obstacles to overcome.
Nobody knows better than I.
However... Not yet.
However, sometimes even the most
conscientious of businessmen
can botch up a deal
for one reason or another.
Understand I don't mean to say
that our merger has hit a snag
or failed to gel or gone up in smoke
or fallen through.
Let me put it this way, gentlemen.
It has sailed away.
I seem to have missed something here.
Would you mind starting all over again?
Now, Miss McCardle.
Elizabeth, I hate to have
to break the news to you,
but at this very moment,
your fiancé, Mr. David Larrabee...
Is late as usual.
Hello, everybody. Hello, darling.
Hello, Linus, how are you?
What are you doing here?
I heard there was
a board meeting going on.
Where are the contracts?
Where do I sign?
- Where's Sabrina?
- Sabrina? Who's Sabrina?
- That name. That name.
- She's on the boat, I guess.
Yeah, but the boat has sailed.
- And there she goes.
- Who goes?
- Sabrina.
- Who is Sabrina?
- Why did you do it?
- Do what?
- She's all alone out there.
- Not according to the afternoon papers.
It says here that "Linus Larrabee..."
That's you, isn't it?
"...and Sabrina Fairchild..."
That's she, isn't it?
"...have quietly reserved adjacent deck
chairs on the Liberté, sailing today."
All columnists should be
beaten to a pulp
and converted back into paper.
Did you plant this?
Me? I thought it was common
knowledge about you and Sabrina.
Who is Sabrina?
Our chauffeur's daughter,
that's who she is.
Now, how about that, gentlemen?
Linus Larrabee, wizard of finance,
man of distinction,
chairman of the board
of Larrabee Industries
getting mixed up with
his chauffeur's daughter.
That's enough, David.
She went after me for a while,
but then she switched to Linus.
I guess it's because
he's got more money.
Now, we all know about
those kind of girls.
And, believe me, gentlemen,
this one is no different.
- Just seems to be.
- I've said that's enough.
Maybe you got smart, Linus,
or maybe you just got lucky,
because you're here
and she's out there.
Brother, she would have
taken you for plenty.
I was just helping you
make up your mind.
You are in love with her.
Well, what are you waiting for?
There's an elevator outside,
a police escort downstairs,
and a tugboat standing by
at the Larrabee pier.
Get moving!
Well, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen,
it appears I have
a previous engagement.
That's the 20th century for you,
automobiles, garages,
chauffeurs, chauffeurs' daughters!
Inasmuch as I seem
to be the only member
of the Larrabee family
who is not completely out of his mind,
I will take it upon myself
to call this meeting back to order
as soon as David Larrabee
removes his carcass from this table.
Sit down, Father.
The olives.
Miss Fairchild?
