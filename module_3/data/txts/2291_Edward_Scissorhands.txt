Be a pal and yell when Peg pulls in.

Any questions for Edward?
Yeah. Get way over.
- Stand right up. - What's been the best
part of your new life here in town?
The friends I've made.
- [Applause]
- Any other questions?
Have you ever thought of
having corrective surgery or prosthetics?
<i>- Iknowa doctor that might be able to help you.</i>
- <i>I'd like to</i> meet him.
We'll give that name after the show.
Thank you. That's nice.
Anyone else? Yes. Stand right up.
- But if you had regular hands you'd
be like everyone else. - Yes, I know.
- I think he'd like that.
- But then no one would think you were special.
<i>You wouldn't be on TVor anything.</i>
No matter what,
Edward will always be special.
<i>[Applause]</i>
More questions? Yes. Stand right up.
Your work is so interesting,
distinctive and unique.
- Do you have any plans to open your own
beauty salon? - <i>[</i> Host <i>]</i> Oh, <i>there '$</i> an <i>idea!</i>

Anyone else?
Uh, yeah. Stand right up.

Back up here, a whole row

- Peg could sell cosmetics.
Yeah. Sure. And this, of course,
is where we wash the hair.
And here is where I stand

But back in here is what
I really want to show you-

This is what I really
want to show you.

- Sorry I'm late.
Hi, Edward. Sorry, dear.
We had to order without you. Here you go.
So, Edward, did you have
a productive day?
Mrs. Monroe showed me
where the salon's going to be.
- You could have a cosmetics counter.
- Wouldn't that be great?
Great.
And then she showed me the backroom,
where she took all of her clothes off.
<i>Edward, I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
I'm just as pleased as punch.</i>
This whole beauty parlor venture's
gonna teach you volumes.
There's nothing like running
your own business.
I've never done it myself,
but from what I gather...
it's the greatest satisfaction
a working man can have.
So I guess the bank's
gonna be your next step, huh?
- The bank?
- Yeah, take out a loan, get yourself started.
<i>Nothing to worry about.</i>
<i>With your talent and reputation,

We simply can't do it.

You have a decided advantage.
You can get one of those handicapped placards.
No problem. Park anywhere you like.
I can't believe it.

But don't you worry.
This isn't the end of it.
We'll get your money somehow.

- With a mattress in the back?
- Why can't you just do it?

We need Edward to get us in.

he hangs onto tighter is his dick.
Come on, Kim.

- No? Why don't you ask him?
- That's not fair. - What's fair got to

- You can pick him up in the morning.
- Oh, dear.
Oh, Edward.
Hello, Edward.
Oh, Edward, dear. I blame myself.
<i>[ Bill] What in God's name was going
through your mind, son?</i>
<i>[ Peg] Why didn't I set
a better example?</i>
<i>You saw how I envied
]im's parents their money.</i>
What were you gonna do
with that stuff once you had it?
I blithely say, “Oh, we'll get money
for the salon somehow.”
But I never meant stealing.
<i>Dear, stealing's not
the way to get it.</i>
<i>Stealing's not the way
to get anything.</i>
<i>[ Bill] Except trouble,
and you're in a serious heap of that.</i>
Oh, Edward,
why ever did you do this?
- Damn those TV programs.
- Damn them all to hell.
<i>Or did somebody put you up to this?</i>
Will he be okay, Doc?
The years spent in isolation
have not equipped him...
with the tools necessary
to judge right from wrong.
He's had no context.
He's been completely without guidance.
Furthermore, his work-
the garden sculptures, hairstyles and so forth-
indicate that he's
a highly imaginative, uh, character.
It seems clear that his awareness
of what we call “reality”...
is radically underdeveloped.
But will he be a/lr/ghz' out there?
Oh, yeah, he'll be fine.
Listen, it could keep me up all night
worrying about you.
You watch yourself, you hear?
<i>[ Snipping]</i>
I just happened to be up,
so I heard all this noise and I ran out.
All along, I felt in my gut there was
something wrong with him.
It could have been my house.
- It could have been any of our houses, but-
- / <i>warned</i> you, <i>d/dn?</i> I?
I saw the sign of Satan on him.
You didn't heed my warning,
but now you will...
because now you can see it too.
Edward,just stay right here.
- What do you have to say in your defense?
- Nothing.
- He doesn't want to talk right now.
- You have to say something.
- What?
- No, h-he can't talk right now.
- He can't talk.
- No comments? No remarks?
So, were you set up?
What was going through your mind?
- We have to get in the house!
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- He'll talk to you later.
- One commentjust one comment.
Oh, for goodness sakes, Lois.
I'm gonna see you at our Christmas party
before I get you here for your haircut.
Of course we're gonna have it this year.
We have it every yea r.
- Why wouldn't we have it this year?
- [Lois Talking, indistinct]
Well, you may think that,
but you're wrong.
You're here.

Were you scared?
I tried to makejim go back...
but you can't makejim do anything.
Thank you for not
telling them that we-
You're welcome.

I did what I could.
My old man thinks he's retarded. Otherwise he'd
still be in jail. What more do you want from me?
- You could tell the truth.
- So could you! You were there too.
- It wasn't my idea. You know I didn't
want to do it. - But you did do it.

Okay. A little ethics.
You're walking down the street, find a suitcase
full of money. There's nobody around.
No human person is in evidence.
What do you do?
<i>“A”: you keep the money.</i>
<i>“B”: you use it to buy gifts
for your friends and your loved ones.</i>
“C”: you give it to the poor.
“D”: you turn it in to the police.

- I'd keep the money.

<i>Hey, how 'bout after dinner we go down

- You're not seeingjim tonight?
- No.

a box of baby possums- 10, maybe 12-
totally naked, no hair at all.
Honey, this is fascinating,
but I don't think your father's finished yet.
Thank you, dear.
Edward, we're waiting.
Give it to my loved ones?
<i>Oh, Edward, it does seem
that that's what you should do...</i>
but it's not.
You dope! Everybody knows
you're supposed to give it to the police.
Good thinking, Kevin.
Well, think about it, you guys.
I mean, that's the nicer thing to do.
That's what I would do.
We're not trying to confuse him.
We're trying to make things a bit easier for him.
So let's cut the comedy
for a little while.
I am being serious, Dad.
it's a much nicer thing to do.
Well, we're not talking nice.
We're talking right and wrong.
- Shut up!
- Oh, goodness sake.
No wonder poor Edward can't learn
right from wrong...
living in this family!
Well, did you hear what he did
to Peg's curtains?
It's unbelievable that they're having
their Christmas party anyway.
- Are you going?
- I don't think so.
He practically raped Joyce, you know,
threatening her with those knives of his.
It's a miracle she escaped.
Oh, I don't have anything
against Bill and Peg, but-
I know, I know. And they've got
that teenaged daughter in the house.
Oh, those poor things.
After what happened to me. Can you imagine?
What did you say to Peg
about the Christmas party?
- I said I hoped we could make it.
- I lied too.
Edward? You want to
give me that new haircut?
<i>- Again?</i>
- <i>Yeah. Sure.</i>
It makes me proud to have you
as my own personal hairdresser.
<i>- H/j honey</i>
- <i>Oh, hi.</i>
- Kevin, you wanna play “Scissors, paper, stone”?
- No.
- Why?
