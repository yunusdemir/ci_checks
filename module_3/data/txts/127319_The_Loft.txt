- What a lucky city councilor,
- Screw him,

it's get a be boring to walk in
around all these parties by yourself?
He wants you close,
but not too close,
Not when there are important people around him,
I Told you I fell for the wrong,
Can you keep a secret?
Ouur City Council man likes to keep my
panties with him at these events in his pocket,
It's a turned on for him,
The thought of me in a crowd so naked,
only he knows,
- Why do you let him use you like that?
- Who says he's using me?
Maybe it's turnes me on,
Maybe telling you about it
it's turns me on even more ,,,
Hope you get cold,
Chris,
- Chris, Chris i am sorry, I don't know,May be i was just testing you
- I do not need to be tested,
Listen, Do you want May be get a cup of coffee,
some place quiet,,,private?
I would like to use your key,
just once, It's not what you think,
It does not matter what I think,
Have fun,
- Does every one still have a key?
- Of cours we do,
It is crucially we get this right,
Five keys were cut,
To make a sixth you'd need
a code, which is in my safe,
Have to rob that out
There was no break-in, so does everyone
 still have a key?
well you think we have been given away our keys?
It's against your rules, Vince,
Then show me,
What are we trying to prove here?
I do not know,
maybe someone lost his key,
lets just rule that out,ok?
Look Here's mine, Right?
Chris?
You did not use a key to get enter,
- no I bring it,
- Where is it?
I have it on me, I
do not need it every day, Like you guys
But do you still have it?
whether if I've my key on me right
now or not is not important,
It is extreamly fucking important,
Someone got in using
a key, and your's are missing,
Is that right Vincent? Than how do you come
for the fact The alarm is Shut Up?
So It is just cut the bullshit coz
it's definetly head we one of us five,
Unless ,,,
- Unless what?
- Unless she let him in,
O yaa? How'd she get him in vincent?
Anyway you look at it always coming back down to us,
and I want to know who is hiding something?
- Is there a word for that?
- Yes, polyamory,
A philosophy believe system about being romantically
involved with more than one person at the same time,
And your boss get away with that?
Yes, he says he is in love with his
wife and girlfriend, so why should he'd to choose,
- His wife is, amazingly cool of that,
- O Really,is she special needs may be occation to pride ,,,
what? Explain,, It's sounds like what kind some Philosophy
What was the name ,,, polyannemarie?
You can barely handle a one woman,
what would you do with two?
Bare one,
I will make up something,some sort of game
involves two ladies and one guy
Something bisexual ,,,
Could you at least fake
with some enthusiasm?
It's your party, anyway
I am cooking,
you absolutely have to invite your friend,
you could well be on time,
They're never here opkay,
 U just join us
I just hope that puke clown does not puke
- from the roof,like earlier
he has been drinking much vodka,
Watching his wife is not it?
Actually she was just cool enough to catch him in the act,
She hired a detective,
cell Phone records, credit card receipts,
audio video in the work,,,
And abruptly my poor boss went from
polyamory to alimony,
Your boss sounds really retarded,
So what happened to him?
He and his concubine
now sits in a tiny one-bedroom condo -
- But I am guessing  he's happy, She is blond,
23 years, with a brand new pair fake breasts,
How can men stand
fake breast?
Why women are always talking about?
fake tits this,fake tits that?
I mean listen girl is this <i>bucha vufa</i> who cares?

Maybe I can help you to
make her choice,
Sarah,
Sarah,
Sarah,
Sarah,
Sorry!
Are you alright?
Do not do it, Sarah,
you're regret,
They have figured it out,
The women, they did it,
Why, Vincent?
They found it,
They found out about the Loft,
Why did you do that, Vincent?
We are your friends,
Why did you do it?
The women, they found out,
We are your friends, we found out about,
What is going on?
- Okay, let's strip him,
- What are you doing?
You are totaly fucking sick in the head,
- I did what you told me,
- I told you to fucking cut her open
It was not part of the plan, and now
let us hope the police will believe it,
- You should have done this themselves,
- Com on just do this,
What have you done?
You kill sarah?
No, we just found her,
We were here this morning before you arrived,
Jesus Christ,
At first I thought she was asleep,
Vincent knows her,
She left this,
See you in the next life,
Why would she have to do it here?
We have to call the Cops,
They Investigate suicide,
Thsi is all gonna come out
Wait, Can we find out where she lives and leave her there?
- Com on,We have to help out Vince,
- But the problem is this- where the fuck is vince?
Is not this his problem?
Vincent is not here,
because I have not called him,
You have not called him?
Why not you called him?
There is something I
have to show you,
You Betraying us? You fucking pervert
You can turn up me later,
We don't have much time,
and we need to watch this,
It will give you a new perspective
by what happened here  on Upstairs,
may be you'll agree
 we should help vincent for this Fuck up,
You see, Vincent has not
always been a good friend,
Maybe I've already got the naughty ,,,
may be With Vincent you sent him that evening,,,
She got her later the night ,
He came to talk to her,
She was drunk when he took advantage
Your little sister is seriously hot
- How long?
- It does not matter,
How long?
He starts seeing her right after your weeding
They met here on regular basis,
If I'm not mistaken,
he was her first,
Gorgeous huh?
The people you love,
they are the only one that can hurt you,
He paid her,
to let you seduce her,
For the hook you
 would share the loft,
It was the first
once paid for,
Have fun,
Chris, you have no idea what you're talking about,
Take just home,
He used your, Chris,
Just like he used everyone,
everyone,
I am gonna kill that son of bitch
It just can't sense anything is up when
he walks in, we have to try in remain calm,
- We are being questioned by police,
- We can not admit to share in this loft,
They will try to turn us against each other,
Okay, I think this can work,
As long we follow the plan,
- Chris
- ok I am in,
But only if we are know for sure,
Vincent was here last night,I wanna here him say it
And it does loke through then -
- I give a signal, break something,
a glass -
- But nothing happens until we know for sure,
Understood?
We got than just two hours to set everything
that will help us,
I'll take care of it, You guys get out of here
Make sure people see you,
- You have the suicide letter, right?
- i got it
You knew what the bring it up to,
And you never said anything,
You are just as sick as Vincent,
They met here on reguler basis,
Vincent has never been a good friend,
He started seeing her right after the wedding,
If I'm not mistaken,
he was her first,
You are a totally fucking  psychopath,
- I did what you told me,
- I didn't tell you not to fucking cut her open,
It was not part of the plan,
Only with the handcuffs to the bed,
What happened here?
You are "enemy",
Swallow it,
My old friends,
- Will I gonna die?
- No, Vincent, you are not gonna die
Sarah lured you here?
and drugged you,
And she killed herself,
with you by her side,Fate will unite us
But you gonna survive,
Because we're friends, aren't we?
So you can see that it was a setup
Sarah and I was setup, the whole things are staged
- It sounds unbelievable, do not you think?
- unbelievable But it's the truth,
My line of work, you gonna prove the truth
, And the prove is what the facts we finding
Fact is that we only find is your
fingerprints and Sarah Deakins,
They dried the place clean,
And we have the DVDs with your sexual
pursuits, with your prints all over them,
Luke made those  DVD's,
I neither even  saw nor touched them,
But we get no DVDs of your friends,
No DVD's of Marty's wife,
No DVD's Philips sister,
No DVD's of Chris' girlfriend,
Facts and findings, Mr, Stevens,
We get  no evidence
that you were being up,
Is there something we forgotten?
To follow the fucking plane, Why
did not you just handcuffed her?
- She was already dead,
- Still Not reason to mutilate her,
She killed herself,
I just made it more dramatic,
You better hope that your
drama does not put us in jail,
Just lean over them a little bit,
Marty will break, may be, Luke too,
Do not taught me how to interogate alright?, We questioned them,
I get no reason that they have been lying,
- finds all your friends have an alibies,
- Alibies? how's  for this morning,
We have Luke Seacord and Chris Vanowen
together at breakfast,
We get Marty Landry at his office,
at his office? look, at least an hour in the morning,
we were all in the Loft,
- So was Philip,,what about Philip?
- He is downstairs right now with his father-in-law,
Fry? What is fuck is fry doing here?
He just gave statement,
Saying that he was with his son-in-law together all day,
- That is bull shit,,that was a false statement
- And why would he lie?
Hiram Fry has a lot of credibility,
I saw Fry, in San Diego, with some bimbo,
Philip knew that , he knew I
pressing Fry to give me a water front contract,
So you tried to blackmailed Hiram Fry?
Vincent Stevens, enough for describe,
We get your imprint all over the DVDs, we get them all over
the knife,
you were chained to the dead girl on the bed,,alright?
Called your lawyer
make a concession and save your ass,
You free to go,
And thanks for your cooperation,
You understand,
that we had to check out your friends,
Of course, that's your job,
There is just one thing that's bothering me,
Why does Vincent Stevens  keep
accusing his best friends?
I do not know,
It bothers me too,
Could it be ,,,?
I just wonder ,,,
Can he hide something else?
- What would he hiding?
- Sarah Deakins murder,
Murder?
Detective in interrogation
called that it a suicide,
How it is a look like, But the autopsy report
tells that sleeping pills did not kill her,
Her wrists were cut up,
but not by Sarah,
Hesitation work with tentative attemts,A person's first cuts to their arm
when slashing their wrist,
- And these we didn't find on her,
- Vincent ,,he,,would never ,,,
- His fingerprints are on the knife,
We did not find a suicide note,
Is there anything wrong?
We did not find a suicide note,
- You have the suicide letter, right?
- I got it,,,
Luke,
You scared me,
You sure it is smart to meeting here?
I think we have a problem, Luke,
How so?
Where is Sarah's suicide note?
- You put it in your pocket?
- Yes, but it's not there anymore,
So when did you steal it from my Coat?
When the doorbell rang this morning -
- Surprise visit
from the real estate?
Chris, its unfortunate
that you lost Sarah's suicide note -
- But I had nothing to do with them,
I called the agencies to ask
who put the Loft up for sale,
All they could give me was this number,
I did called them,
I thought ,,,
What if ,,,
It's over, Chris, We pulled it off,
We have nothing to worry aout now,
Why did that note disappeared?
The only real proof
that she committed suicide,
Listen ,,, We must ,,,
Sarah Deakins ,,,
Is it because may she did not write it?
Maybe it's your handwriting?
Vincent Fucked us all
You saw it
Yes, I saw it,
All the DVDs that made everybody crazy,
- But right  long with your grand plan
Didn't we?
But why, Luke?
What did you do to that girl?
She came in your way?
Between you and Vincent?
actually it was Vincent,
stand between us,
Is there someone else?
He is much better than you,
Sarah! Wait,
Forget Vincent, He is better
games than you,
He has always was
and always will be,
He is hurting you, Using you,
Why are you telling me?
I am telling you because ,,,
I would never hurt you,
Just give me the chance,
To show that I will never hurt you,
That's right, You can never hurt me,
Because I feel nothing for you, Luke,
I'm sorry,
Maybe in another life,
You were here last night?
Barbara was out and ski, So I
I thought that I could find Vincent here,
- And Sarah,
- I'm sorry,
I waited until he left -
- She said I was right about Vincent,
Cpnsoling,,,
I have become so good at it,
CI gave her insulin overdose
929
Quick, painless,
Leaves no trace,
Jesus, Luke,
I did it her for love,
I swear
An Vincent taking the fault for this,
It's okay with you?
Vincent used everyone and anyone!
It was his turn to what he did
Yes, now he is been charged with murder
Sarah was not dead,
when you left her with Philip,
No,no,,, you're lying,
It is not possible,
What Philip did to her was sick,
You are sick, Luke,
But if what I hear is right -
- So it was your brother ,,,
Who killed sarah
Okay, Chris, Go home, I'll clean up,
Like always,
No ,,, -
- No more cleanup, Luke,
Go outside, Now,
Let me help you, Luke,
- Will you kill me too?
- It's your own fault,
- What do you want to me? jump?
- Yes, if you don't mind!
Luke! You do not do it,
Luke, will you Stop it?
I will not hurt you, Chris,
I really not,
- Then just do not,
- Never!
I called the cop before I came,
I told them everything,
- A lie! I know you havn't,
- I thought I knew you,
What about the note?
You want it to go down with me too?
Give it to me, Chris,
Give it to me,
It's over, Luke,
You are right,
It's over,
Tell Allie and the kids,
I'm sorry,
would you do that for me, Chris?
- No,
- Come on, Chris, Be a friend,
Luke! Luke! Luke!
- They are married,
- Honey, no, hey're having an affair,
- Because she laughs at his jokes?
- No, I'm telling you that they're having an affair,
Since when are you the big expert on affairs?
Really ,,,for taking me back mimi,
That was my only alternative, Otherwise
would you stand and cry at the front door,
Sorry, Do we scare you out?
I have the kids tomorrow,
so I gotta go,
If you leave me here alone?
With my wife?
- We can get at leastone more drink,
- There will be plenty more drinks,
- Goodnight you two
- Good night, Chris,
Chris!
- Anne?
- Hi,
Hi,
- You look good,
- Thanks, you too,
Listen, I still have the key,
Do you want it back?
It is not work any more,
Vincent lives there alone now, It is the
only his wife lets him keep,
- And Phillip?
- He is waiting for the trial -
- We shall see,
And you? you're doing ok?
- Most of the time,
- And the rest of the time?
I heard you descend the City Council?
That's not all, I've given up,
Do you want to grab a cup of cofee ?
