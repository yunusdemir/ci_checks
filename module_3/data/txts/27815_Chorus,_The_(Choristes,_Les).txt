Nobu...
The library is closing soon
If you are borrowing a book,
proceed to the checkout desk...
Kawashima san?
You've got a heavy load
Can I help you?
No, I'm fine
I'm savoring each moment It's my last day
Where did the time go?
Has it been 20 years already?
Yes
Thank you so much over so many years
No, thank you
After you retire, are you
returning to Hokkaido?
I just...
You had told me once,
that's where you're from
Well, yes...
I live alone, with no dependents
I think I'll tour some
hot springs for a while
I'm Orihara from the
Setagaya Police Department
I'm Honda
What do the police want with me?
I need to ask you
Do you know a man called Suzuki Nobuto?
Suzuki Nobuto
May we come in?
He's 29 He's a steeplejack
This man
Born in Hokkaido
I see traces of the boy
Yes, I know him
He was my pupil when I taught at the island
branch school, years ago
You taught?
Yes, until 20 years ago,
I was a teacher in Hokkaido
Oh, you were a teacher
So, Suzuki Nobuto was...
My last student
Your last?
Yes
Have you ever seen Suzuki since?
- Never
- Phone calls?
No
Ls Nobuto in some kind of trouble?
We're locating him as a material witness
in a murder case
Murder?
He's under suspicion of murdering the
president of the company he worked for
So, Suzuki has really
never made any kind of contact with you?
Not even a New Year's card?
Never
Why do you think he has?
We found a note
with your address and phone number
in Suzuki's apartment
My address?
So we decided to pay you a visit
He's a man of few relatives
and hardly any friends
"Kusatsu Hot Springs"
Taking a trip?
Yes, I've just retired from work
I want to take it easy
Yes, Kusatsu
Their hot springs are fine
Sorry to have disturbed you
If Suzuki tries to contact you,
please let us know
I will
Tell me,
what kind of student was Suzuki?
I had 6 students in the branch school
He was my youngest student
He was a crybaby
Anything would set him off...
"Misaki Branch School"
- Nobu's outside
- I know!
There he is!
Nobu!
Incredible!
Why did you do this, Isamu?
He made that crappy doll
and starts bragging that it's his
little brother. Nobuto's an idiot
Don't you call him an idiot!
Nobu's lost his mother and father
and lives alone with his grandfather
He worked hard to make a little brother
because he wants a family
How could you break it?
Because...
That hurts!
Nobu's heart hurts even more
Go find him and apologize!
"To our teacher, Haru"
"Happy New Year Hoping this finds you well"
"From Manami"
Thank you for your patience
ANA ?ight 571 has landed
at Wakkanai Airport on time
"Sarobetsu Wetland Center"
Hokkaido deer...
Tracks
Three deer
Manami!
Teacher!
Branch school!
What?
Rise, bow, sit
Teacher!
Manami
I can't believe that Nobu
killed someone
ls there some mistake?
I hope it is
I'm not the one who gave Nobu your address
Nobu lost his grandfather
when he started middle school,
and someone took him to Kanagawa
That's what I heard
I don't know anything about Nobu,
after that happened
<i>Oh, I see</i>
You came all this way
and I can't help you, I'm sorry
That's all right
It's wonderful just to
see you doing so well
You still love to read, don't you, Manami?
You remembered?
I used to visit your house to borrow books
I was so happy when you came to teach
at the branch school
The teacher before you didn't care
and I was bored at school
So when we heard a new teacher
was coming in the new term,
we could hardly wait!
Her name's Kawashima Haru
The deputy mayor's daughter
My mom's customer told her
There's the deputy mayor
Hello
It's my daughter...
She used to teach in Sapporo
Her husband's a college professor
He's coming with her
A college professor sounds kind of scary
ls, is, is, the teacher... s... s... scary?
Haru!
Haru!
Father
So glad you came You, too, Yukio
Thank you for...
Haru, your branch school students
are here to see you
Wave to them
Hey! Your new teacher
Her name's Haru!
Nice to meet you
Tell me your names
Oh, go... go... good
- I'm Yuka
- I'm lsamu
Do you remember? That classroom scene
lsamu was bullying Nobu as usual...
Connect the red wire to the positive...
Not again
My ears hurt
Shut up!
It's all your fault, lsamu
lsamu, you're the pits
Are you OK? You'll be OK
Again
Now, all of you
Faster
That was the first time we realized that
Nobu could really sing
"I'll pick all the ?owers"
"blooming in this wide field"
"I'll give them to you"
"every last blossom"
"I'll wrap the bouquets"
"with red ribbons"
"I'll pick..."
It wasn't just Nobu
Every one of you sang like an angel
I was so surprised
lsamu wasn't really angelic...
Just a little less than angelic
We had so much fun back then
That next year, we were
qualified to sing in the
Sapporo chorus contest
We were all convinced that we would win
But the accident...
You quit teaching because
of that accident, right?
That's not true
Are you sure?
I still wonder sometimes,
how on earth that could have happened
I don't know why,
but first Yuka and Naoki
started fighting...
You're so mean
You can't say that!
In no time, we were all having a huge fight
What are you doing! Stop it!
After that Yuka's voice...
Stop it!
"The canary that"
"forgot its song"
"Shall we strike it"
"with a willow-whip?"
"No, no, that would be"
"too cruel"
"On an ivory ship,"
"a silver oar..."
Not again The contest is next week
I'll never sing the solo, Yuka
Nanae or Manami should sing instead
Yuka...
Yuka, look at me
Let's have a barbeque tomorrow
A barbeque?
We'll all take a break
Sure
Maybe we practiced too much
Can I eat any... anything?
You can eat as much of whatever you want
Your husband joined us
I'd never been to a barbeque before
Thank you so much
I had so much fun that day
But...
Yuka tripped her foot
She said she tripped, but...
I thought she tried to kill herself
No, Why do you say that?
When Yuka
lost her voice, I was really happy
I wanted to sing the solo so bad
Yuka,
starting tomorrow, I'll sing the solo
Then Yuka said,
You just want me to die, don't you?
I was so shocked I just ran away
Then I heard Yuka scream
and when I turned around...
Yuka!
Teacher!
<i>Teacher Haru!</i>
Yuka's life was spared,
but your husband,
never...
Yukio!
Yukio!
Yukio!
I always thought it was
my fault your husband died
Because I said that to Yuka
I always felt so sorry about it
It was not your fault in any way
But if your husband hadn't died,
the villagers wouldn't have said
those awful things,
and made you leave the island
That you left your students with your
husband to go off and meet a man
That day, you disappeared at some point
Where did you go?
We have to escape
Look at those clouds
Teacher...
We're so weak, aren't we?
Teacher, use this
Thank you
Have some coffee
Thank you
Your husband is so kind
That's his only talent
What does that mean?
I'm worried about Nobuto
I'll try to find someone who knows him
Someone from the branch school?
In that case, you know, that...
Oh, it's Naoki!
I ran into him on a training course
in Sapporo and we reminisced
He works for a trading
company in Sapporo now
But he goes to Tokyo a lot
and he said he wanted to see you
That's when I gave him your address
I see
Teacher
Naoki
I'll be back in touch
I'm sorry to disturb your work
It's all right, we're just
closing down the office
The company went bankrupt
I wanted you to see me as
a successful grown-up,
but I failed
It's true that Manami gave me your address,
but I didn't give it to Nobuto
That Nobuto...
Killed someone...
I can't believe it
What was his job?
I heard he's a steeplejack
A steeplejack...
He always liked high places
Do you remember?
After his grandfather scolded him...
You evil brat! Suit yourself! I'm done
Nobuto! You idiot! Get down!
You'll die!
What are you doing, Nobu?
Grandpa, he, he, hates me!
I'll become the wi, wi, wind!
Nobu!
Wait! I'll come get you!
Close your eyes and don't move!
I'm scared!
No, you're not
Teacher's coming to get you!
Hold on tight! Don't you fall!
Teacher
You watch out, Teacher!
Nobu, let's climb down together
One step
You're fine
Nobuto's family
had evacuated from Sakhalin after the war,
and his parents died so young,
leaving him with his grandpa
He must have always been lonely
But after you came,
he really brightened up
Because you found his talent
The same with me
It had never occurred to me that I had
any talent
You had a clear, high voice...
"After midnight, the rain"
"will no doubt turn to snow"
"Silent night"
"Holy night"
"I doubt you'll make it"
"A lonely Christmas Eve"
"Silent night"
"Holy night"
"My secret wish,"
"lodged deep in my heart,"
"I doubt it will come true"
"I was certain"
"I could tell you on this night"
All that applause
None of us had ever been praised like that,
so we were thrilled
"What is it you're looking for?"
"Is it something hard to find?"
"You've searched your bag and your desk"
"but you still can't find it..."
I don't know if I've ever
had so much fun since that night...
Misaki Branch School, fight!
You know, I...
There's always been something
I needed to say to you
Always
I asked Manami your address
because I wanted to see you to apologize
Apologize?
The reason your husband died...
It was my fault
I was the one that caused
the fight with Yuka
As you know,
my dad was a drunk who barely worked
Back then,
he went to Yuka's mom's bar every night
It was Yuka's mother's fault
my family was poor...
Somehow, I thought
that it was Yuka's fault, too
"The canary that"
"forgot its song"
"On an ivory..."
After Yuka was selected for the female solo
in the chorus contest,
I watched her practice so proudly,
and it made me so mad
I told Yuka something awful,
that really insulted her mother
The reason Yuka lost her voice,
was because of what I said to her
So when you worried about us
and invited us to the
barbeque, I was really happy
I decided somehow, I'd apologize to Yuka
But I couldn't figure out how...
I wanted to ask your advice,
but your husband said something to you
and you went somewhere
I asked your husband later,
and he said he had sent you to deal
with something important
So I asked your husband's advice about Yuka
Your husband listened to me like a father
Someone once said,
"Even if the world will
be destroyed tomorrow,"
"today, you'll plant an apple tree"
Whatever you can do now, do it
So you don't regret it
You understand?
A man should never fear results
Seconds!
Yuka...
But she ran away
She tried to kill herself It was my fault
Yuka!
I never saw you
before you left the island
I could never
apologize to you or to Yuka
I hated being poor
In order to escape being
poor, I studied hard
I worked hard, graduated college
and went to work at a good firm,
that's now bankrupt
Not again... Do I have to go back to that?
Naoki
"Even if the world will
be destroyed tomorrow,"
"today, you'll plant an apple tree"
When I got desperate, I remembered
what your husband told me
I'll be fine
My co-workers and I
have decided to start a new
company in Vladivostok
I'll leave next week
That's Yuka
Ando Yuka
- A strawberry?
- Yes
After graduating
middle and high school,
I went to a Sapporo college,
she to a Sapporo community college
We both found jobs in town
We've never spoken since...
But she's
always nearby
I wrote out your address
and gave it to her the
other day, saying nothing
Of all of us, Yuka was closest
to Nobuto
She might know something
I've got to get back to the company
Naoki...
if Nobuto really did something like that,
there must have been a serious reason
You really haven't heard from him at all?
If he tried, I would know
"The canary that"
"forgot its song"
"Shall we toss it..."
It turned out just like the song...
After you left the island,
we stopped singing
We were all canaries that
had forgotten our song
We felt we'd been tossed out
Nobuto's stammer got much worse
and he got bullied at the school in town
Me too
What with my mother's work...
I'm so sorry
Why should you apologize?
I'm the one that has to apologize
No matter how much I apologize,
it can never be undone
Yuka
Why don't you get mad at me?
I'm the one who made
your husband die
I have never once thought that
If I hadn't done what I did,
your husband never would have died
What did you do?
It's true,
Naoki started the fight
But,
I started the whole thing
You chose me to sing the solo
in the chorus contest in Sapporo
I was so happy, I called
my father in Sapporo
Daddy?
Yes, I'm fine
I'm going to Sapporo for the chorus contest
Yes, I'm singing
On Sunday
After their divorce, I
lived with my mother,
but I really wanted to live with my dad
Great!
I'm going to wear this dress to Sapporo
My mother bought it for me
You look like a d, d, doll
She's not a doll!
Give it back
Your mother tricked a man,
my father, and bought it with that money!
Your father doesn't work,
drinks all the time and is a hopeless guy!
Why do you say that? You're so mean!
You can't say that!
But it's true
When he accused my mother,
I think I felt ashamed
The more I thought about performing for
my father, I panicked and lost my voice
You did it yourself?
No...
I knew that day, Naoki
wanted to apologize to me
But I was stubborn
and also mad at Manami for saying
she'd take my place
I just hated everyone,
and wanted to make them suffer
When I faked suicide,
my foot slipped...
Yuka!
When I came to...
Yuka!
Yuka!
Your husband saved my life,
but was dragged by the tide...
<i>Yuka, Yuka</i>
Are you OK?
Are you OK?
I'm OK
It's my fault
The reason they said mean things about you,
was because of my mother
She left the students with her husband,
who's not a teacher,
while she went to see some
guy That's what I heard
- Are you listening?
- I'm listening.
I've heard there are bad rumors
It's a problem if they're true
Yeah, she came later and helped Yuka,
but she was off with some guy
when it really mattered
My mother spread bad rumors
about you all over the village
It was her fault, you
had to leave the island
She is such a liar
Your mother isn't a liar
She told the truth
What?
At that time,
I really was seeing a man
Yuka
Look at me
I see now that Naoki
and you have both been blaming yourselves
for my husband's death
For making you think that,
I truly,
deeply!
Apologize
Teacher...
And although
it might seem cowardly to tell you
after all these years,
I will, hoping that it will lighten
the burden on your hearts
My husband had a brain tumor
at the time,
and had been told he had 6 months to live
Six months?
We came back to the island,
because he wanted to spend what
was left of his life
on the island he had loved as a student
You knew your husband's life
was about to end but you...
It's a lie
I don't believe it
You see Yuka,
that's my problem
For me to bear...
Deep in my heart, all alone
But it's not your problem
That was an accident
Please leave it in the past
That's what my husband would want
Teacher...
<i>You am Naoki both,</i>
should just think about your lives
I understand you've always
stayed near each other,
but have never spoken
Do you know why
Naoki handed you the note
with my address?
Because he wanted to talk about you
and the branch school...
No, that's not it
He wanted to talk about us
You see,
actually, I always really
wanted to talk to Naoki
But...
I was terrified of what he would say to me
I was just too scared
Naoki felt exactly the same
Next week, he's leaving Japan
Is that what you want?
Is it, Yuka?
Here we go...
That was fun, wasn't it?
Teacher Yuka, we're back
Thank you so much
Is it today?
Yes, it's today See you
I'm sorry
Just hold out my hand and say nothing...
Teacher told me
It was a long time...
- Always...
- All right
This...
Isn't an apple tree, is it?
No, it's not
Love you
I'm home
"Herbal Pharmacy"
"No one would"
"make someone stand there..."
Welcome home
I'm home
Did my father visit?
Yes
He bought me lots of medicine again
I'm sorry but please throw them out
But you could
at least try them out
No matter what I do,
my life is doomed
I'll cook supper now
I already ate
Don't worry about me
You do what you want
Dear, are you OK?
- Dear?
- Don't come in
Open <i>m</i>
I've told you, leave me alone!
- Dear!
- Please
Don't come in
You're wounded...
Hand me the knife!
Hand me the knife!
Can't it wait one more day...
Is this OK?
Yes, hold on
Fill out your name here, too
Sir...
Abe...
Are you...
Your hand...
You all right?
Yes
Why'd they have to send us that weirdo...
Was he really a competent cop?
Yeah...
One more day...
One...
More day...
Teacher? I was able to talk to Nanae
Nanae's working at a shipyard in Wakkanai
Yes, she's a welder
She's up on that ship
Thank you
When she recently went to Tokyo
with friends, she ran into Nobuto
Teacher, you haven't changed at all
Have you been well?
I'm sorry to surprise you like this
Manami told me...
Nanae, you've grown so tall
I grew too tall
I can't believe Nobu killed someone
When I saw him in Tokyo,
he was with a woman he was planning to marry.
He seemed so happy
Marry?
Yes
After acquaintances took him in,
Nobu really suffered
They wouldn't send him to high school
and he wound up apprenticing
as a steeplejack
but he got bullied for his stammer
and moved from job to job
He met her on his last job
She seemed so kind
She's older but he really loves her...
Nobu, see you again!
He said
he fell in love because
she resembles you in spirit
The s, sea...
He said he was happy
because she reminded him of our chorus days
That's when he asked for your address
He wanted to invite you to their wedding
But I didn't have it
Honestly,
I'd forgotten all about
the branch school and you
Rather,
I tried never to think about it
Why?
The day your husband died saving Yuka,
I'm the one who told people
you were seeing another man
The day of that barbeque,
I had a fever and couldn't go
But the fever passed so
I rode my bike there
The truth is I wanted to sing
the solo instead of Yuka
And Manami did, too
Sol couldn't bear if
Manami got the solo when I wasn't there
At the time, I didn't know what to think
so I just went home
Yukio!
Yukio!
When I saw you then,
I just started hating you
Because you'd betrayed your husband,
I felt like you'd somehow betrayed me, too
Yumi?
Mizuho...
You two-faced friend, betraying me!
What were you doing!
Tell me!
- Please stop!
- Was it fun?
- Please!
- Yumi!
Stop it!
Come, Mizuho's watching
Don't you touch my husband again!
I'll never forgive you
for the rest of my life!
Come! Come!
- Please cut it out!
- I'll go home
Mizuho, you OK?
I'll bake cookies Let's go home
I miss the island
Thank you
Teacher...
Yes?
I always thought it was your fault
When I talked to Nobu about
it in Tokyo, he said,
"Haven't you ever loved someone?"
Nobu told me,
he had once seen you
when you were with that man
At the end of winter vacation,
Nobu got scolded by his grandpa...
Where's
Teacher H, Haru?
That was all he saw
After he fell madly in love,
he finally understood what he had seen
"Once you fall in love,
some things can't be helped" he said
Yumi,
was my friend,
ever since high school
But I...
I...
I just couldn't help it...
I missed you...
lsamu is on the island
lsamu became a police officer
and was just transferred there this year
"Suzuki Nobuto"
The captain says to check out
Suzuki's village again,
but no one lives there anymore,
and there's no chance he'd come back here
Nobuto!
Hey, wait!
"No Trespassing"
Hey!
Don't climb!
Hey! It's dangerous!
You're Nobuto, right? It's me,
lsamu, from the branch school
I, I, Isamu?
You're still... You haven't changed
Nobuto!
Teacher
lsamu?
He hit his head and is unconscious
The doctor doesn't know if he'll revive
Temperature, 35.6 C
Blood pressure, 112 over 60
<i>Why</i>
did Nobuto come back to the island?
Maybe he wanted to die where he was born
Did you talk with Nobu?
No, not at all
But,
when he saw my face, he called out,
"lsamu," like a friend
When he smiled, I remembered him as a kid
I always used to tease him,
but I actually liked him
Yes
I know
I...
Both my older brothers
were known for being smart
I was the only dumb one,
and they both teased me for being stupid
for a doctor's son
So I just teased Nobu to
take my mind off of that
But he...
No matter how much I teased him,
he just followed me around
Even when you left the island...
mm, why, doesn't Teacher come to school?
I don't know!
Mm, why's she leaving the island?
I don't know!
I, Isamu Stop Teacher
Tell her n, not to leave the island, OK?
I, I'll sing better I'll be a better boy
Tell her not to leave, OK?
In that moment,
I couldn't tell if I was angry or sad
Don't ask me Teacher doesn't care about us
She's thrown us away
That's a lie!
Nobuto thought of you as his mother
He couldn't bear
to be separated from you
Finally that winter...
Nobu...
But,
after that, Nobu...
Teacher!
Teacher!
Teacher!
- Teacher!
- Nobu!
Don't go! Don't go! No!
Nobu!
Don't
Stop!
Nobu...
Don't go, Teacher!
Don't
Teacher!
Don't throw me away!
I did something unforgivable
To you, my students
and to my husband
I...
Actually I hated your husband
I looked after a stray dog
I couldn't keep it at home so I fed it
on my way home from school
One day, I went as usual...
lsamu?
It's really painful to face your own death
I'm sure it's not what
Teacher's husband wants,
but he can't see things clearly anymore
That the people around
him are suffering, too
<i>You mean, Teacher Haru?</i>
I wondered why you fell
in love with that cop,
after I became one myself
He watched his hostage
murdered before his eyes
He was a police officer,
but he couldn't save her
"I couldn't bear that
only I had survived it"
"Only I..."
Maybe you felt just like he did
You worked so hard teaching us to sing,
but actually,
you must have wanted your husband
and him to hear us sing
That's what I think now
"Let us spread"
"the joy"
"We may"
"still be young"
"But our hearts"
"can become"
"as pure and clear"
"as that blue sky"
Matsuda san
Are you free?
All right
Excuse me
Teacher
I'm sorry I can't let you see Nobuto
I'm home
Welcome home
What are you doing?
I'm looking for my glasses
How strange...
You're wearing them
What?
Found them
It must be because of their fight,
but Yuka's lost her voice
What if you feed them a nice meal together
so they can make up
How about a barbeque
Let's all have a barbeque
I'm feeling better recently
I'll help out
Really?
Yes
What is it?
What?
What?
It's...
Nothing
Let me carry one
Didn't you buy too much?
We'll make curry from the leftovers
Leftover curry for days?
Watch out!
Father
Where are you going?
To be with that man?
Let me go, I'm worried
Are the rumors true?
<i>Haru</i>
What a fool you are
Behave like this, and everyone finds out
It's not just Yukio
Listen, Haru
You're teaching children
the difference between right and wrong
But you'll wind up wounding them all!
Let's go home
You,
knew about it, right?
Why don't you get mad?
I just...
Can't find the words
to apologize to you
Haru is...
suffering,
because of me
Father,
lam...
Happy to have been loved by...
Your daughter
<i>Haru</i>
What?
He has
quit the police force
He's leaving
the island today
See him off
Please tell him...
Don't...
Die...
Live...
Go...
Teacher! Nobuto's...
Nobuto's...
I'll get that
How's Nobuto?
He's alive
He miraculously regained consciousness
Is that so?
Someone's watching over him
Yes
No doubt the woman who loves him
Yes
Haru, welcome home
I'm home, Father
Help her
Right, Grandma, I'll get that
Damn, it's cold
I, I, did really...
My boss...
K, k, k, k... Kill...
You killed him
I, I, I'm...
S, s, sorry
We'll escort him tomorrow
Confinue
K, Kazumi san,
is the boss's w, wife
She was terrified by his physical abuse
I, I...
Always, u, used to... Get b, beat up myself
Sol, I hate seeing people get b,

Why did you come back here?
If, if, I'm going to die...
D, die, here...
No, no, no
We finally got the phone records
You called Teacher Kawashima,
right before you escaped
She must have told you,
to hide on the island Didn't she?
Nobu told me he was
desperate to apologize to me
for throwing the rock at me
He was planning to die
That he wanted to sing with
the branch school students again...
Nobu...
Yeah,
I, I, got to hear your voice
s.., so happy
B...Bye...
Homework
H, homework?
Yes
I asked you to think about how
the canary that forgot her song
would sing about it,
before our last rehearsal
I...
Never got your assignment
So, please, Nobu
Let me teach my last class, the one I
couldn't teach because of my fault
Please,
wait for me on the island,
until I get there
Nobu...
We, we're not
driving to the port
No
Officer Matsuda...
I'm begging you.
Please
He was begging me, crying
He got to me
Besides, I'm retiring
Really?
Just go
"My school,"
"elementary school"
It won't be long
I'll look the other way
Hey.
Where are you going?
Nobuto
Nobu
<i>Nobuto, Teacher</i>
<i>Nobuta, Teacher</i>
T, teacher
Shall we start?
Let's start
- All together
- We remember...
Here goes
Misaki Branch School
Fight!
Nobu
"The canary that"
"forgot its song"
"Shall we toss it"
"on the hill outback?"
"No, no, no,"
"that will never do"
That teacher sure suckered us
That doesn't matter
What was it I forgot?
"No, no, no that"
"won't do either"
"The canary that"
"forgot its song"
"Shall we strike it"
"with a willow-whip?"
"No, no, that would be"
"too cruel"
"The canary"
"that forgot its song"
"On an ivory ship,"
"with a silver oar,"
"a?oat in the sea,"
"under moonlight"
"The canary will"
"recall its forgotten song"
Yes?
<i>Teacher,</i>
I didn't realize you were so little
You're the one who grew, Nobu
Right
After I came back here,
and I stared
out at the sea, every day,
I remembered something
What?
After you rescued Yuka
Your husband...
Before the waves took him
For a moment...
For one moment...
One moment?
Like this...
He truly...
Seemed relieved...
Thank you, Nobu
My homework
What?
How the canary that forgot its song feels
I've been thinking about it
Then and now,
it's hard
to say in words...
<i>Teacher,</i>
I...
Have a right to live, right?
I have to keep on living, right?
Even if it's difficult
D, d, difficult...
It's difficult
Hey!
Time to go!
I'll see you again
Nobu!
Come home!
We'll be here!
Nobuto!
Sorry for everything
We'll all sing together again!
We'll be waiting!
See you soon!
You're not alone!
We'll be waiting!
Stay well!
Nobu!
We all...
Love you!
Nobu!
Nobu!
Nobu!
Nobuto!
Nobu!
Say, Haru
You've lived out your life
the best way you knew how
Why don't you
forgive yourself now
Father...
Oh...
It arrived again
this year
"I am alive"
I'll stay alive...
That's plenty
I hear
he works abroad now, removing landmines
"Let us spread"
"the joy"
"We may"
"still be young"
"But our hearts"
"can become"
"as pure and clear"
"as that blue sky"
"Let us not forget"
"the sadness"
"We may"
"still be young"
"But our hearts"
"can become"
"as pure and clear"
"as that blue sky"
"Let us stay"
"bright forever"
"We may"
"still be young"
"But our hearts"
"can become"
"as pure and clear"
"as that blue sky"
