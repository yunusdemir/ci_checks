Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Oh, shit. Hello, Helen.
I'd almost forgotten you work here.
I know, I know.
You'd almost forgotten I work here,
but I swear I was up all night
toying with ideas for the fashion show,
and I've really hit
on something. You see...
What?
I took 4 bottles of vodka on Friday.
It was my birthday. You know that.
I was having a party, and I was
running late, so I borrowed some.
- I bought some more to replace it.
- Not a lot of use to me
when I have nothing to offer
the executives who drop by late Friday.
You could have told them
you'd run out. It's popular stuff.
Bullshit, bullshit.
We're in P R. That's what we do, isn't it?
But you didn't do that, did you, Paul?
No.
So I'm out, am I?
Well, this is just perfect.
Congratulations.
You wanted me out for ages.
Now you've done it.
Very well done.
Theft. Pretty foolproof.
OK. I'll go. I'll go.
I was getting a bit choked up
with all the testosterone
flying about the place.
It's best I get out
before I start growing a penis.
Told you... Lesbian.
Whoops.
Thank you.

You all right, luv?
Oh, it's a bit of a nasty cut.
Might need a couple of stitches.

# And I can't take it no more #
- Beatles lyrics, eh?
- What?
Elastic Thrombosis -
they're guilty of lyric poaching.
- They're Beatles lyrics, aren't they?
- I don't know. Sorry.
Of course you do. Everyone is born
knowing Beatles' lyrics instinctively.
They're passed into the foetus
along with all the amniotic stuff.
In fact, they should be called
The Foetles.
Not a fan, clearly.
Funny how nobody talks
on the tubes, isn't it?
I rarely catch
the tube myself, or lifts.
Confined spaces, everybody
shuts down. Why is that?
Perhaps we think everybody on the tube
is a potential psychopath or a drunk,
so we close down and pretend
to read a book or something.
Look, I don't think you're a psychopath,
I just want to read my book.
I understand. I apologise.
I'm in a little bit of a good mood today
as a matter of fact, so I'll just...
Sorry.
Have we met before?
No, no. Honestly.
- You seem familiar.
- I don't think so.
Yes. Yes, you were in the lift just now.
You dropped your earring, I picked it up.
- Oh, yes. You did. Thank you.
- Pleasure.
- Do you work there?
- I did do, but I've just been fired, OK?
Oh, that's...
- That's horrible. I'm sorry.
- It's OK. You didn't do it.
Thank you for your concern.
I'm glad you're in a good mood, et cetera.
Thank you for picking up my earring,
but I just want to read my book.
I get off at this stop.
I'm only telling you in case
you get off at this stop, too,
and you get off before me,
and you think I'm following you.
Which I'm not.
I mean, I wouldn't. You know?
I really didn't mean any offence. Please
forgive me. I'm really not a nutcase.
I apologise.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure you're not a nutcase
or a psycho or anything,
it's just that I'm not...
I'm not that good at, um...
- you know...
- Constructing sentences?
Anyway...
- I'm James.
- Helen.
I never figured out
why we didn't make it, Gerry.
You went back to America, remember?
I couldn't afford the bus fares.
I came back, though.
Turn my back for three years, and
you callously ditch me for another woman.
I know. I suppose
I'm just naturally impetuous.
I live with someone.
A man. I live with a man.
- Really?
- Mmm.
I have people I consider soul mates
who don't confide in me this much.
And what would he say if he knew
you were walking up from the tube
in broad daylight
with a complete stranger?
Big deal.
It was nice to meet you, Helen.
Sorry about your job. Really.
I suppose being a Gemini
has its down sides.
Hey, remember what
the Monty Python boys say.
What, "Always look
on the bright side of life"?
No. "Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition."

# You know, I read it in the magazines... #
Ohh! Ohh!
Fuck!
I didn't think you liked Elton John.
I... I do sometimes.
You really shouldn't stop like that.
Set a woman back three days
doing a thing like that.
- Who is she?
- She is Lydia.
Well, I've had a dreadful day.
I got sacked.
So did you, it would seem.
- Cup of tea?
- That'd be nice.
You bastard!
You bastard!
You useless, shagging bastard!
I come home and catch you up to your nuts
in Lady-shagging-Godiva!
I am working all hours
to support you
while you are supposedly
writing your first novel.
How long, huh?
Do you love her?
No, don't tell me. I'm not interested.
No, do tell me.
I am interested.
I'm only asking because I need to know
exactly how big a mug I am.
Look... look...
Hello!
- Helen? Is that you?
- No, it's your bit of stuff.
Wednesday...
shag day, remember?
# How can you stay
when your heart says no?
# How can you stop
when your feet say go? #
Have you just got up,
you lazy git?
No. Uh...? Well, I, uh...
I didn't sleep that well last night.
And then, you know when you left,
I kind of... I went into a really...
a really, really deep, deep,
deep sleep.
I think I might be coming down
with a... Anyway,
what are you doing home
at this time of...
Oh, my God!
What happened to you?
Well, it depends.
- Which story do you want first?
- What?
Well...
I got mugged and...
- What are you doing?
- I can't stand Elton John.
You know that. Well, anyway, listen...
tell me what happened?
What happened to your head?
I got mugged and sacked,
only not in that order.
Though it wasn't an actual mugging,
it was only an attempted mugging
according to the police
because they didn't...
- Whoa, whoa.
- Because they didn't...
Wait a sec. Come here.
Come here.
Now sit down. Just sit here, OK?
Now... you're in shock, darling, OK?
You had... a little bit of a shock.
Now just relax.
Do you want a brandy?
- It's 4:00 in the afternoon.
- Of course it is. Sorry.
Gerry...
- Are you OK?
- Me? I'm fine. Fine.
Anyway, anyway...
t-tell me, what happened.
And I just couldn't help thinking
if I had caught that train,
it would never have happened.
I'd have been home
ages ago.
Oh, well,
don't wonder about things like that.
You know. "If only this...",
and "What if that..."
It's done now.
Come on.
Follow.
Splash.
I'm going to take you out
and get you alarmingly
out of your head on Grolsch.
And then dry.
And then follow.
Follow.
Follow, follow, follow.
And then, when you've sung all your
favourite Barbara Streisand songs
at the top of your voice
and got us slung out of the pub...
Yeah. Put this on.
I'm gonna let you have carnal knowledge
of a lamb passanda,
which your diet does not allow,
with a double tarka dahl,
which you can then puke
all over the pristine doorstep
of Herr and Frau Goebbels next door,
and I'll help you.
I love you, Gerry.
Gerry, she's not here.
Anna, you're Helen's best friend.
Where else would she be?
Come search the place if you want.
She's not here, Gerry.
What is it you've done, anyway?
Can't be that nice if she's walked out.
OK, look, I'm sorry. Look, if she
comes here, just let me know
or get her to ring me or something.
That's all I ask.
Like you say, Gerry,
I'm Helen's best friend.
If she comes here,
I'll do what SHE asks.
# I'll have this meagre defence
# I was hoping that
# You're an amateur
# I was hoping that
# You'd know better
# But I've been wrong before #
Well, she's got a point.
You can't stand Elton John.
Forget about Elton John.
That's not the issue. What do I do?
Gerry, you've told me for weeks you
couldn't hack it juggling Helen and Lydia,
and you wish you hadn't got
involved with her again.
I know.
- You weren't cut out for infidelity.
- I know.
But you couldn't end it with Lydia
'cause you weren't sure how she'd take it.
- I know all this.
- And I told you something...
if you remember my words... something
ungoverned by you would happen
to bring the situation
to a head.
- I know.
- And something has.
It's not funny, actually, Russell.
I'm sorry, old man. I beg to differ.
It is funny.
It's very, very, very funny.
And look at you. You're not rushing
about frantically trying to find her.
I went to Anna's.
She wasn't there.
Oh, went to Anna's?
Boy, you're a one-man SAS crack unit.
- You want my opinion?
- Will I like it?
Well, of course not.
It'll be based on reality.
No, no, no.
You don't advertise a new restaurant.
It's very uncool.
It's word of mouth. People talk.
And how do these people
who talk know where you are
so that they can talk
about you?
It's your restaurant, Clive.
I just want it to work. Helen.
Hello. James.
Rather annoying chatty
bloke on the tube?
Oh, yes. Hi.
You look all stressed up
with nowhere to go.
It's only a job.
You'll get another one.
No, it's something else,
isn't it?
Sometimes it helps
to just say whatever it is out loud.
It also helps if people mind their own
business and leave you alone. Sorry.
When I left you at the tube earlier,
I went home and found my boyfriend...
In bed with another woman?
Shit.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's... I mean...
- What an idiot.
- It's OK. You weren't to know.
No, not me. Your boyfriend.
He's an idiot.
Sorry. It's not my place.
It's OK.
Look, if it makes you feel any better,
you see that bloke over there?
Not only does he own
a set of crocodile-skin luggage,
but his favourite
TV program is Baywatch.
So you see, there's always
someone sadder than you.
- Do you love him?
- No. I could never love a Baywatch fan.
Hey, you did a joke
in the midst of your turbulent
emotional state. That's very positive.
Listen, if you decide you want
company, we're over here, OK?
I'm really sorry, Helen.
Two of your most disgustingly
large Grolsches, please,
and a large Jack Daniels with ice,
and I'll have the same.
You're behind.
Can we have another?
15?
Gerry came looking for you.
- Is it what I think?
- It depends.
Is what you think that I walked in on him
shagging Lydia in my bed,
and I walked out?
- Pretty much.
- Then, yes.
Oh. Hold on. Yeah?
'This morning was sensational.'
- Oh. I can't... Sorry. I can't hear you.
- 'Gerry? '
- I can't hear you.
- 'Can you hear me? '
Didn't know it was on.
Ready, steady, go!
See you, James.
- Who's that?
- My friend.
Come on, you.
Let's get you home.
- Right.
- Drunken eejit.
OK. Whoa.
And again. Come along.
- Can I give you a lift anywhere?
- Yeah, that would be great. Thank you.
Hands up if you drank
too much, eh?
Hey, I'm not as drunk
as thinkle peep I am.
Put a wick in her mouth,
and she'd burn for a fortnight.
9 Menlove Avenue. Thanks a lot.
French bean, some chicken,
some rice...
- One more little Indian.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Really. I'll be sick.
Well, but we've gotta move locations
for that, so don't swallow for ten minutes.
He didn't fancy me.
He offered us a lift.
He was just being concerned.
Uh-huh. Well, let me tell you,
if he'd been that concerned about me,
I wouldn't be helping
you into bed right now.
Am I in bed?
Yes. You're staying with me for awhile.
Don't worry. You'll be fine.
Just fine.
There we go.
- There we go.
- Ohh.
'Are you some peculiar,
thus far undefined breed of dickhead?
'You have two head problems... '
One - that was close.
Very close. Put in layman's terms,
she nearly caught you.
And two -
this is far more worrying
than the first one -
you're talking to yourself
in the mirror again.
Really bad sign.
Bigger sip.
Bigger sip.
Bigger sip. Don't throw up
all over me.
There are no PR jobs.
I'm going to need some
part-time work, Gerry.
What you need
is a change of image.
You know, it goes back and then,
you know, sort of comes like a slant.
# Baby, it's a changin' atmosphere
# And I've seen the signs, I know
# That it's right for me to go
# I'm on my way
# So when you think of yesterday
# Remember all the things we said
# And through the course of history
# I hope you'll still
# Remember me
# And there can't be no other way
# There's nothing left for us to say
# I've got to see it through alone
# I've got to do this on my own #
- For you there.
- Hey, gorgeous...
what do you do when you're not
serving mad-cow burgers in here?
Well now, let me see.
I get up about 7:30am.
Make and deliver sandwiches
in the West End during the day
before I come here about 6:00
and finish at midnight.
After that, if I've got any energy left,
I give me boyfriend a blowjob.
Would you like
some mayonnaise with that?
- You don't mean that.
- I do. Really.
So, you were together
two and a half years...
and you've been sitting here
like suicide on a stick for a week.
- Nine days, Anna.
- For nine days. But bollocks to him.
Yes. I mean, why hasn't he even
called to see if I'm OK?
To admit that he's a twat.
Hello, Helen, it's Gerry.
I'm a twat. Please come home.
I love you. All that shit.
Oh, I don't care anyway. Bollocks to him.
- I'm over him.
- Oh, you're over him.
Yes. Totally and utterly
and completely over him.
- No, you're not.
- I am.
- You're not.
- Anna, I'm over him.
What do you mean I'm not?
How do you know I'm not?
Well, two things really.
You're still counting how long you've
been apart in days, hours and minutes.
But the flashing red light way
of telling you're not over someone
is reading their horoscope
in the hope they're going to get wiped out
- in some freak napalming incident.
- Smart arse.
- What is he?
- A wanker.
Oh, Aries.
Aries... Aries...
Well, just shows how much I know.
"With Mars in the ascendancy,
"you will get wiped out
in a freak napalming incident
"and Helen says bollocks to you."
This guy's good.
You go.
No, I will.
No, you.
I'm not in. I'm out.
You don't know where or who with.
Especially who with.
Quickly, go on!
I am not answering
the door like this.
Please, you have to.
It won't be him anyway.
So there's no big deal, is there?
Bollocks to him.
Bollocks to him.
Bollocks to him.
Bollocks to him.
Bollocks to him.
Bollocks to him. Bollocks to him.
Come on.
If you don't drink your fatty drinks,
you'll never really
achieve quality cellulite.
Your haircut suits you,
by the way.
No, it does.
It does. No gag.
Never make a joke about women's hair,
clothes, or menstrual cycles. Page one.
Look, James, maybe I shouldn't be here.
I'm sorry. I'm not being fair.
You know, under
normal circumstances etcetera,
you're really nice and funny.
My friend Anna thinks you're cute.
Wait, hold, hold.
Your friend Anna thinks I'm cute?
Your friend Anna thinks I'm cute?
Shit, I just blew...
Wait.
Oh, 2.85...
2.85 on the wrong girl.
Helen, listen.
Sometimes we are plonked
into people's lives
when they just need
to be cheered up and reassured
and it turns out
that for some reason it's your job.
We don't know why.
In your case, it's my job.
But, I'll be honest, the fact
that I find you moderately attractive,
just makes the job
easier on my part.
My intentions
are completely honourable.
I have no desire to overstep
the mark. Seriously.
You prefer diamonds or sapphires?
Sorry.
- "Moderately attractive"?
- A-ha! I knew you were listening.
Well, you know, lose the sad eyes,
the droopy mouth,
I could get you an upgrade.
So, having firmly established
the ground rules,
what are you doing two weeks
on Saturday?
- Probably killing myself.
- Excellent. What time does that finish?
Do you like boats?
Do you know we haven't
done that for two months?
- Don't be daft.
- Two months... almost to the day.
Almost to the day, listen to you.
What are we, a survey?
Gerry, how did one of my Waterford
crystal brandy glasses
get into
the laundry basket?
- To the where?
- The laundry basket.
I don't know. Can I answer
questions in seventies pop music?
Last week, when I got the sack
and I came back, am I going mad?
But wasn't there was some brandy
and two glasses on the dressing table?
- I don't know. I couldn't really say.
- Well, there were, I'm sure.
Oh, hang on, no, wait a minute.
No, I could say.
There was a bottle
and one glass because...
No, I'm certain there
were two glasses, Gerry.
Helen, I'm not sure I like
where this conversation is going.
No, I told you. I couldn't sleep,
so I got up in the night
to get a drink
to knock myself out.
It was still there in the afternoon
when you got home.
I mean, you had also that day,
if you remember,
had taken a blow to the... the head.
We just had a party.
Maybe one of your mad friends
like Anna threw it there.
I mean, Jesus!
Let's spoil the moment
properly, shall we?
What are you trying to say?
Am I shagging a brandy drinker? Yes.
Gerry, ease up, will you?
For Christ's sake. I'm only asking.
Oh, women never ask.
No, they don't ask, they insinuate.
And you are insinuating,
not very subtly, may I add, that I am...
Thanks.
No, no, no, no, no.
Thank you. Thanks.
I mean, thank you.
Thank you.
I mean, this is the right time, isn't it,
to address our relationship, isn't it?
I mean, it's... it's... it's perfect.
Perfect moment.
Gerry, for God's sakes,
I asked a simple question.
There's no need
to become Woody Allen.
Thanks, James.
I'm sorry if you had a lousy time.
Are you kidding?
In my book, getting to drink
two chocolate milkshakes in one sitting
represents social splendour.
It's one of the perks of being shallow.
Take care, Helen.
You'll be fine.
Thank you very much.
It's amazing how you can actually learn
to despise inanimate objects.
Like tin openers
that don't open tins,
egg mayonnaise and Skipjack tuna.
You going out?
Yeah. I was just writing you a note.
I'm off to the library.
I have some stuff to read up on.
OK.
Well, I won't be more than
a couple of hours.
- Would you rather I didn't go?
- No, no, of course not. Go.
OK, bye.
Lydia, what are you talking about?
She followed me.
I said I was going to the library,
so I've come to the library.
For God's sake!
Of course I can't come now. What if she's
still lurking around the corner or something?
'So what? Is she there?'
Lydia, I don't know why
she followed me. I'm not a sleuth.
'I have taken 2 hours off work, Gerry.'
Please, don't get hysterical.
Look, I'm sorry! OK, I'm sorry!
I booked our hotel in Dorset.
Are we still going?
Do you want to cancel it? I mean,
is she going to follow us there?
Do you want to end this...
Yes. I mean, no.
I mean, no, I don't want...
Of course we're still going up.
Don't... don't...
Don't don't
don't don't what?
I don't know.
Look, we're going
to Dorset, OK?
We're going to have a great time
and I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Right, that's the lot.
- You don't live there anymore.
- Thanks for going again, Anna.
- Any evidence of her?
- Nothing that stood out.
- Hello.
- 'Hi, it's James. Is Helen there? '
Helen.
It's James.
Hello.
Yes, tonight. You know, the tonight
that comes immediately after today.
He wants
to go out tonight.
Go.
Please come.
It'll be a laugh.
- OK.
- Great. See ya.
- OK?
- Yeah.
- She doesn't want to leave here.
- I know.
She's really frail, James.
Do you want me to postpone my trip?
There's another course
later in the year.
It's only a couple of weeks.
You should go.
- You sure? It's not that important.
- It is important. I want you to go.
OK.
It's going to be hard
to leave this place, James.
But you've still got the London flat.
You'll be nearer the hospital, and
you can get much better crack in town.
Hey, you know
what the Monty Python boys say...
"Nobody expects the
Spanish Inquisition." I know.
Exactly!
Sorry. Let me just... Lydia's becoming
more and more demanding.
And you feel bad because Helen's
working night and day
to keep the money coming in.
But you've asked Helen to come
on a research trip to Dorset with you,
knowing that she won't be able to...
to cover up the fact that
you're really taking Lydia.
And despite the fact that Lydia
gave you an out on the phone,
which you didn't take,
you're having a moral dilemma.
Gerry, you are a morality-free zone.
If I had no morals,
would I be discussing it?
Whose idea was this trip...
yours or Lydia's?
You wanna get out of this Lydia thing.
I foresee problems.
And I wouldn't mind betting you're
talking to yourself in the mirror again.
- Very bad sign.
- You've no compassion.
None!
Why do I bother confiding in you?
I'm your mate.
I'm here to help you.
I'm sorry.
I'm here to help you.
Bom bom bom! Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition.
Our chief weapon is surprise.
Surprise and fear. Fear and surprise.
Our two chief weapons
are surprise and fear.
And a ruthless efficiency. Our three
main weapons are fear, surprise,
and a ruthless efficiency.
I'll come in again!
- Whoa! Wow!
- Pass me your plate.
- How do you do, Nigel?
- Very nice to meet you.
I am deadly serious.
Oh, just set up
my own PR company.
Yeah, well, why not?
You've got the experience,
the know-how, the contacts.
You want to spend the rest of your life
working for other people?
Hey, what's the worst
that could possibly happen?
I could fail miserably
and look like a complete tosser.
Exactly, so what is there
to worry about?
I had a really
nice time, James.
Did you? Oh, shit! Sorry.
That's against the rules, isn't it?
Yes, it is, so just bear that in mind
in the future, would you?
I'm getting over
a major break-up.
Yeah, sorry.
Won't happen again.
Good night, Helen.
Hey, you know everything
happens for the best.
You'll never know
if you don't try.
Wear something warm on Saturday.
It can get cold on the river.
Take care.
# Is that you?
# Looks like you've
changed your ways again... #
So, what other ideas
has James run by you?
Anna, don't do that.
Don't do desperate mother acting
with me. He's a friend, OK? Friend.
I'm not remotely interested
in him romantically.
- You're not.
- No.
So how come last night
was the first night you didn't ask
if anyone had called
when you walked in the door?
# What I know now
# It's not always a happy ending
# Yeah, but hey
# Here comes that rainy day again
# Hey, look at me
# Don't feel like crying no more
# I won't feel like crying no more
# I don't feel like it
# Hey, look at me... #
You're sorry?
You're sorry that four of the staff here
have been cut down with food poisoning
after eating your sandwiches.
And yes, they all had the same sandwiches
and the same symptoms at the same time.
Are you trained
in the catering trade, may I ask?
No, actually, I work in PR
Well, you're not doing a particularly good
PR job this morning, are you?
Luckily for you,
I've convinced my colleagues
not to take the matter
any further... this time.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have five people's work to do.
Sorry? Helen has been delivering
sandwiches to your office.
Yes. And today I had
reason to summon her.
Well, I made up a reason,
to be brutally honest.
She's quite pretty in a British,
horsey sort of way, isn't she?
Lydia, what are you playing at?
Have you gone raving mad?
- She's not bloody stupid, you know.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
I wanted to see what the woman
you ditched me for is like.
Now, now, now, wait a second.
Now, I didn't ditch you for...
I mean, you went back
to America...
I wanted to see what this girl you seem
to have no intention of leaving...
despite the occasional pre-orgasmic
suggestion that you are...
has that is so unleaveable.
And I have to say that I ended
our brief meeting at a bit of a loss.
Lydia, don't talk like this.
Now, it sounds ugly.
I told you before I cannot leave
Helen for... for... for...
- You know.
- For me?
Is that what you're trying to say?
You can't leave her for me?
Well, you never said you
wanted that, have you?
Gerry, I'm a woman.
We don't say what we want.
But we reserve the right
to be pissed off if we don't get it.
That's what makes us so fascinating
and not a little bit scary.
- Hello?
- Ah, General Flanagan, at last.
This is your kindly
Uncle Russell here.
Listen, wherever you were tonight,
as if we need to ask, you weren't with me.
- Helen called here looking for you.
- OK.
- Yeah, all right.
- OK, thanks, mate. Bye.
Thank God. I was so worried.
Where have you been?
I went to Anna's.
I needed to see a friendly face.
I've had a horrible day.
I met Cruella de Ville's
less-nice sister this morning.
- She completely deflated me.
- I know.
How do you know?
Well, no, I mean I can tell.
Jeez, you look terrible.
Where were you earlier?
I really needed to talk to you.
Oh, I had some stuff to read up on,
so I went to the library.
God, you're always at the library.
I'm sick of waiting on tables.
I know when you finish the book
we'll be millionaires,
but when are you going to finish it?
I'm going to finish it
very soon, Helen.
Very soon.
Helen, there's something
I want to tell you...
I need to tell you.
Um, it's a little bit to do
with the brandy glass,
and a little bit to do
with that woman you met today.
Only please let me finish
before you say anything, OK?
Helen?
...Bollocks.
Come on, James!
Go, boy!
Come on!
Go!
# I've got an aching in my bones
# I've been exposed
# To what I want to see
# The fuse is burning somewhere
# It's drenched in me
# It's where I long to be #
It's really weird.
I knew there'd be a boat race going by
with purple and white shirts. Sorry?
Why hasn't he asked you
to go with him to Dorset?
He has. I've got to work.
Anyway, it'll be good for him
to get away. We need a bit of space.
Anna, can I ask a daft question?
Did you drop a glass in the laundry
basket at our party?
Sounds like a ridiculous thing to do.
It was almost certainly me.
- Are you OK?
- Just going quietly mad.
Thank God for that.
I was worried.
Faster!
Yes! Yes!

# Head, head
# Seven sons had Father Abraham head #
Are you sure it's just
writer's block?
I mean, you seem so distant.
I'm here, Gerry, if you need
to talk to me about anything.
Hey, that's Helen in there.
# Seven sons
had Father Abraham head... #
She's got blonde hair.
There's loads of them having
some kind of sponsored epileptic fit.
Lydia.
Maybe it isn't writer's
block at all, Gerry.
Maybe it's Helen block.
I don't want to hear about Helen.
I don't care about Helen.
The trouble is you do.
Quite clearly.
I just thought of a great
finish for your book.
"The End!"
Yes, you are, Clive.
He's opening
his first restaurant in six days,
and he's completely disorganised.
Well, you know,
at my old company,
we had wars getting
Pierre Claude's restaurant open.
- You did Pierre Claude?
- Mmm.
He's my hero.
You did his launch.
Well, I heard that was a really classy do.
People went on about it.
I mean, six days is...
Could I come down
and take a look?
I can't promise
anything stupendous.
Sure. Yeah! Yeah, no problem.
You're kidding.
Yeah, come down!
Pierre Claude. Oh, wow!
You're very thoughtful, James.
You give out an incredible amount.
Oh, you're the same.
You encouraged me today.
I saw you jumping up and down
like a mad thing.
It spurred me on.
I love this bridge.
My great-grandfather helped build it.
I often come and stand on it
when I want to...
Build a bridge?
I'm sorry.
Oh, God, James, don't.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm...
I know this is an ideal
sort of kissing moment.
You know, night, moon,
boat, water lapping.
You know, it's, um, it's perfect.
And I'm not not feeling
that it would be nice,
but I don't really
know anything about you
and I'm... I'm still
on the rebound.
Oh, God, I hate that word, but I am.
Oh, who isn't? Everyone is.
I'm on the rebound myself in a way.
- Who are you on the rebound from?
- A girl called Pamela.
My whole life pivots around
Pam and I breaking up.
- When was that?
- 1973. We were eight.
I bloody loved that woman.
No warning. Just up... gone.
Left me for somebody else.
- Who?
- Gary Glitter.
- Get out.
- Gary Glitter, for crying out loud.
I mean, all my friends were being left
for Donny Osmond or David Cassidy.
I could have come to terms
with that given time.
But Gary. Oh, she wanted
to touch him there, yeah.
You know? Well, I went to pieces
as you can imagine.
And there was no junior Prozac
to see me through, so...
So, I... I, um...
- I kissed you.
- Yeah, yeah, I spotted that, too.
You weren't going to do that.
Um, ahem,
would you mind, um,
just putting that down to a momentary
lapse of, um, concentration?
- Is that what it was?
- No.
Yes? I don't...
Oh, help.
I don't want to be a confusion
in your life, Helen. I don't truly.
But something's happened to me
since I've met you...
that I wasn't expecting,
and I don't really...
Well, well, wasn't expecting.
Repetition of expecting.
I must buy a thesaurus. Anyway, I...
You did remember to take a full
page out in Adulterer's Weekly?
Lydia, get in the car,
will you?
How many years have you been
going to paint that stain off?
# Ooh, I must believe
# I can do anything
# I can heal everyone
# I must believe
# I am the wind
# Yeah, but I am the sea
# Oh, oh
# I am the wind, I am the sea,
I am the sun
# I can be anyone
# Oh, this world is mine
This world is mine
# For all of time
For all of time
# I can turn them to stone
# Come let me fix my home
I can do anything
# I'm gonna
get myself together... #
- He didn't even pay the bill.
- Of course not.
- I'm sorry... excuse me.
- Sure.
What do you mean
you want to see me?
Jesus Christ, Gerry, what...
How did you get in?
One of the waiters is a friend
of Russell. He got me a ticket.
It's a great do, Helen.
I hear your company's really taking off.
Gerry, you can't just turn up like this.
This is a really important night for me.
Yes, I can, Helen.
I can just turn up.
It's the most important
just turn up I've ever done.
Oh, God.
We can't talk in here.
# I must believe
I must believe... #
We've been through too much just
to drop this, haven't we? Surely.
Helen, please, look at me.
I'm sorry.
Really sorry.
You're too good not to fight for.
Don't, Gerry,
don't talk about fights. I...
Good-looking bloke.
Are you seeing him?
I... I'm sorry.
It's not my place to ask.
- Is that him?
- I guess so.
- Does she know about Claudia?
- No.
I really like her, Clive.
I'm confused.
I feel a bit lost suddenly.
Gerry, I really have to go back inside.
Will you come
and see me, Helen?
Please, Helen,
there's so much more I want to say.
I miss you.
Will you come and see me?
Please, Helen...
I'll go.
Thanks for listening.
I'm really proud of you.
# I am the wind
# Yeah
# I am the sea
# I am the wind, I am the sea,
I am the sun
# I can be anyone
# Oh, yes, I'm the night
# That's right #
Are you OK?
- Are you OK?
- Yes. Just a bit dizzy.
Too much champagne.
Sorry.
Hey.
It's official. I love you.
Thank you. You're a genius.
I'm ecstatic!
Have you seen James?
Yeah, yeah, he had to go.
Early start. He apologised.
Business trip. Newcastle or something.
I didn't want to pry.
His secretary wasn't very forthcoming.
- Do you believe he's away?
- Don't know.
- Think he's just avoiding you?
- I don't know.
- Did you leave a message?
- No.
Do you think maybe you should have?
Did he actually see Gerry kiss you?
I don't know.
Do you think he might be hoping you've
called and not known that you have?
Did you not check
if he has a mobile?
Anna, ease up, will you?
Bloody hell!
They have less questions
than these on Jeopardy.
I was nervous. I wanted to get off
the phone. I felt awkward.
Well, it's such a little thing.
It's hardly worth getting uptight about.
Oh, Gerry called, by the way.
Terrific.
That's just...
Two months ago, I want Gerry
to come around. James comes around.
Now I want James to call,
Gerry calls.
'It was the weirdest dream.
'You were there, and you had
a funny mask over your face'
and you had something that you needed
to tell me, but you couldn't say it.
Well, that does it. I'm taking away
your class one drugs for a week.
Anyway, um, there's something else
I wanted to tell you.
- I fainted at work the other night.
- Sweetheart, are you OK?
Yes, but I don't normally faint,
so I, um...
- What was that?
- I don't know.
The people next door are plainly
engaged in some bizarre sexual ritual.
I may pop in later and introduce myself.
What were you saying?
Anyway, I don't normally faint,
so I was a little curious.
Oh! Oh!
Ow! Oh, sh...
I stubbed my foot on the side
of the shagging bath. Oh!
- God, sounds horrific.
- I know. Shh!
Anyway...
Listen, there's the landlady. She keeps
bringing corned beef sandwiches.
Look, I'll phone you back when
World War Xll has stopped for tea.
So I did a test and it turns out
that I'm pregnant.
I just thought
you might like to know.
Have you gone completely insane?
What are you trying to do?
What do you mean what am I trying
to do? I think I broke my toe.
Lydia, I'm on the pissing phone
to Helen, for goodness sake!
In case you've forgotten,
she doesn't know you're here.
She thinks I'm on a research trip...
alone, remember?
I remember.
Don't worry, I remember.
It's pretty hard to forget.
So what are you trying to do, huh?
Coming in here screeching
the place down while I'm on the phone.
Don't you know, Gerry? Don't you know
what I am trying to do?
I am trying
to be your girlfriend, Gerry!
I am trying to win you back!
It's fairly simple.
I am standing on the platform
at Limbo Central
with my heart and soul
packed in my suitcase
waiting for the Gerry
fucking express
to roll in and tell me
that my ticket is still valid!
That I may reboard the train!
Only the station announcer
keeps coming on
and telling me
that my train has been delayed!
As the driver has suffered
a major panic attack in Indecision City,
we suggest you take the bus!
That's what I am trying
to do, you cripple!
Except...
it's quite clear that that
is never going to happen.
Is it?
No reply... Perfect.
So, I... I'm not waiting any more, Gerry.
I am cashing my ticket in.
I am taking that bus.
Oh, God. I tell all my friends,
"Never go back."
Look at me. I must be crazy.
Don't phone me for a while.
No, don't phone me at all... ever!
It's over!
Again!
I've done it, Russell.
I've bloody done it.
Excellent. Congratulations.
Done what?
- I've finished it.
- Oh, the book?
Oh, well, great, mate.
That's great.
Not the book, Russell.
I'm a novelist.
I'm never going to finish the book.
The affair.
The sordid affair with Lydia.
I've blown her out... in Dorset.
I was decisive, but fair.
I've just got back.
Oh, God,
I feel like I've got out of jail...
No more deceit,
no more lying to Helen.
It was such a mistake.
Never go back, Russell. It's over.
God, I can't tell you,
it's such a good feeling.
Well, I'm... I'm very pleased.
How does she feel about it? Lydia?
You know,
she's not jumping through hoops,
but it's the best thing by far.
By far and away, the best thing.
I mean, she knows that.
I mean, she will do...
Well, she was upset.
I mean, a bit fraught,
you know, ob-obviously.
Oh, God, I feel good.
I've got to get home
before Helen comes back from work.
You never even buy me flowers when
you're meant to! So yes, I'm suspicious.
What else have you been doing
that you're not meant to?
Wait. Let me get this straight,
because this is brilliant.
I buy you flowers on a whim,
in a... in a fit of... of... of, um...
of romance, but...
See? You couldn't even
think of the word.
But instead of being...
of being grateful,
instead of being romanced,
you're instantly convinced that I'm
ensconced in some decrepit, tacky,
underhand clandestine affair?
In a nutshell.
Gerry?
Are you back?
I missed you, so I came
home early to see you.
God.
What are they?
They're flowers. For you.
Do you not like them?
That image of her sitting on top of you...
Oh, God,
I don't know why I agreed to come.
Please stop, Gerry. Don't.
I don't want you to touch me.
I'm... I'm sorry. I... Don't go.
Please try and put her out of your mind.
She's out of mine.
It's finished... over.
I made a mistake...
such a big, big mistake...
and I'm sorry.
I'm truly, truly sorry.
I mean, this new bloke... this James
Hammerton that you're seeing...
- does he not make mistakes?
- How do you know his name?
A mate of Russell's
works at the restaurant.
They're mutual friends. I...
I mean, it's not especially important.
I don't want to talk about James
Hammerton or anyone else.
I have to go.
Oh, by... by the way,
I've, uh...
I've stopped writing the book.
Helen...
the truth is,
I can't write without you.
I can't do anything without you.
I want you to come
back to me, Helen.
We were so good together.
Remember how good
we are together?
Sorry. Just wait.
- Yeah?
- I'm late four days. I'm never late.
Oh, Russell. Look, mate, look...
Can I ring you back
in a few minutes?
Yeah, OK.
Thanks, mate. Cheers. Bye.
That was Russell.
Look, I'm... I'm dying for the loo.
'Telephone number
0171-444-3184.
'To return the call, press 3.'
Why are you pretending I'm Russell?
You know I hate that.
What's going on?
Gerry, answer me.
Who's there?
It's Helen, actually.
We met once.
I interrupted you faking your orgasm.
Sorry I can't be more specific.
You know what I was thinking?
- You're not going, are you?
- You wanker.
You sad, sad wanker.
God, I feel like such a mug!
That useless, no-good,
shagging, horrible,
despicable, lying,
two-faced, pissing,
shagging...
- You said shagging.
- Wanker!
You know the worst bit?
All I could think about was James.
I felt like I was being unfaithful
to James just by being there.
That sounds like the best bit.
And you were.
He didn't call, did he?
That's nearly a week.
I think I've blown it.
I've blown it, haven't I?
I blame British Telecom.
All this new technology...
this number to know who called,
another one to withhold your calls,
itemised bills, take away
the first number you thought of.
They are single-handedly condemning
the average red-blooded Englishman
to a life of terminal monogamy.
What are they after?
The Nobel Peace Prize?
Lydia might be pregnant.
Oh, no more, please.
I can't take it!
Oh, this is terrific stuff.
Being with you makes the wait for the next
episode of Seinfeld much easier to bear.
I didn't reckon on things turning out
this way. Everything's a cock-up.
What's going on?
Well, to use
boxing parlance, if I may,
it's quite simple - you've just lost.
Are you sure?
You've been a bit...
I don't know,
a bit distant since I've got back.
I know.
Well, OK, there are a couple of things.
Which one do you want to hear first?
- I don't mind.
- Well, the small thing...
is that I've got
an interview for a job...
a PR job...
a proper one.
An international company
opening up in London.
Chairwoman herself called...
said she had heard a lot about me,
and she's invited me to her apartment
tomorrow evening for a serious chat.
Jesus Christ!
- What?
- Jesus Christ,
I mean, that's...
that's not a small thing.
That's... that's huge.
That's... I mean, it's brilliant.
- I mean, that's the best.
- Is the blind buggered again?
No, uh... No. Well, I...
- Are you all right?
- Yeah... no, I'm fine, darling.
My sweetheart, that's great.
It's tremendous.
I'm thrilled. I'm so thrill...
- Hello?
- I really need to talk to you.
Hi, Russ.
How are you?
Come by my apartment tomorrow night
at 8:00. It's important.
Ah, really, mate? No. What a drag.
Oh, no. Yeah, sure, sure.
Yeah, I'll help you.
Yep. Cheers, mate. Bye.
Russell's family
is descending unannounced.
Yeah, he wants me
to go round tomorrow evening
and, help him clear out his spare room.
Uh, right. OK. So...
Right, then.
Sorry. What was the other
thing you wanted to tell me?
It doesn't matter.
It's not important.
Hamilton Enterprises.
Rachel, I'm going out to the shops.
Can I get you anything?
No, thanks.
- You OK?
- Yes.
Yes. Yes, I'm fine.
I just... You know,
I'm... go to the shops. I'll be, um...
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
- Hello.
- Hi. Hi.
- How are you?
- How are you?
- I'm great.
- I'm fine.
How are you?
Um, sorry. You're great.
- Business lunch?
- Yeah, just a chat, you know.
- My office is just around the corner.
- I know. Um...
I thought you were
away on business.
Yeah, I was. I just... I got back
last night, as a matter of, uh...
Helen, look, please
don't think that I...
Oh. It's OK.
I... I haven't thought...
I mean,
I didn't think that... or not.
No, I mean,
don't think that I have not called you.
I haven't not called you.
I mean, I don't...
I don't mean I haven't not called you,
because that's a double negative,
- so as to say that I have called you.
- When did you call?
Well, I didn't.
But I... I didn't not call you
in the way that you might think
I didn't call you. Oh, dear.
I wanted to call you.
I even dialled all but
the last number thing and then not.
- It's ridiculous behaviour.
- Totally.
You see, I thought you still had
to deal with... with your other, uh...
Oh. Gerry?
Well, I don't know.
Is that... yeah, if...
And I thought it was best
if I allowed you to...
- Gerry is why you haven't called me?
- Well, after Clive's party,
I didn't want
to just presume that we'd...
You think I just go to bed with all the
successful oarsmen I come across?
Sorry. Nervous humour.
Well, I hoped not.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Hello?
Oh, I see. I'll, uh...
I'll come straight away.
OK, thanks.
My mum had to go
into hospital.
She's had some tests done.
The results are through. I should go.
Do you want me
to come with you?
Yeah.
That's really nice of you.
Uh... Well, maybe, um...
I don't... She's quite frail,
and I don't know how she's going...
- It's OK.
- But, um, thanks.
I'm... Some friends are having
dinner at Clive's tonight,
if you're not doing anything.
You want to come along?
- Well, some other time.
- I'd love to, if that's OK.
Yeah, yeah.
Of course. Crikey, it's...
it's very, very OK, yeah.
Well, at the risk of sounding
old-fashioned, I'll pick you up at 8:00.
Is that a will pick me up
or a haven't, not, didn't, might?
Listen, don't worry about your mum.
She'll be OK.
Remember Monty Python.
Well, I'll see you later.
Bye.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Just... you know.
Is Gerry excited
about being a daddy?
I haven't told him yet.
Never seems to be
the right moment somehow.
Come on. Let's celebrate
with a proper drink.
Bloody marvellous idea.
I really shouldn't in my condition,
but I'm really going to.
- What have you got?
- Brandy.
Ooh, no. Yuck.
Makes me vomit.
# Coming up for air
# Rising to a very new
# Somewhere
# Coming up for air
# I'm the last breath around
# I'm the last breath around #
Half day?
James?
So it was last night?
Sorry.
You can't tell from one.
They can be inaccurate.
I bought three packets.
Two in a packet... that's six.
You can tell from six.
What are you going to do?
- Is James Hammerton in?
- I'm afraid not.
Um, do you know
when he's due back?
I'm not sure. He's gone to visit
his mother in hospital with his wife.
Would you like
to leave a message?
What?
Can I take a name and number?
Get him to call you?
Um... No, thank you.
There's something
I want you to know.
Anna doesn't drink brandy, Gerry.
It makes her vomit.
And those glasses
were not used at the party.
They only come out for special dinners.
You know that.
Am I meant to immediately
get the reference here?
Are you having an affair?
Just tell me...
yes or no.
No.
I'm not.
Helen... look into my eyes.
I am not having an affair.
I'm not.
Well, I shouldn't have brought this up now.
I've got to go to my interview.
We'll talk later.
Are you going to be here
when I get back?
Yes. Of course.
Helen... listen.
Good luck, OK?
- Hello?
- Hi, Anna. Is Helen there?
You've got a damned nerve
phoning here.
What?
Anna, please, just open the door.
I don't know what's going on.
You don't know what's going on?
I'll tell you, then.
She saw you, James,
at the hospital with your wife.
You know, the one with the wedding
ring. What is it with you bloody men?
- Anna, let me see her.
- She's not here.
- Where is she?
- What's it to you? I don't know.
Oh, shit, shit. Bollocks!
Oh, God, you idiot!
- Clive, you seen Helen?
- No. Why?
Thank you!
Helen!
Helen!
Helen! Helen,
you've made a mistake!
Oh, I'm such an idiot!
Look at me, Helen.
- Listen to me, please.
- No, you listen!
I never want to see you again!
I have been through
enough for one year!
I stupidly believed
that here was a man
who was different from men,
but it is clear that I made a mistake.
Now please do me a favour
and go away!
I am married, Helen,
but I am separated.
Walk away if you want,
but take this with you...
the woman you saw today
was the woman I married three years ago.
We separated six months ago,
and soon we'll be divorced.
Nothing aggressive.
I didn't tell you
before, because...
I don't know why. I...
I have wanted to tell
you so many times, and...
and now you've found out another way,
I wish I had told you.
My mother is ill
in hospital, as you know,
and Claudia agreed
to keep up the pretence for my mum.
As a favour.
She's a very decent woman.
Do you have a mum,
Helen?
Ten minutes, Lydia, and don't ever turn up
at my kitchen window again like that.
It's over, you know?
You said it yourself.
I know. Sorry. I wasn't thinking.
I just want to show you something.
Oh, Helen... if we are not going
to be together,
let's make sure it's for the right reason,
and right now, there is no reason... none.
There is just confusion,
and it can be erased in a split second.
Get that, would you?
Of course, if you don't want
to keep it... Who is it?
Oh, hello again.
You're right on time.
Is this the truth, James?
Permission to engage the enemy, sir?
I can't take the interview just now.
I'm discussing whether or not I'm going
to keep your boyfriend's baby.
James... there's something
I have to tell you.
I'm so sorry you had
to hear it this way, Helen.
I'll tell Anna
I'm OK.
Helen...
I love you.
Helen, wait.
Please, wait.
- Let me go!
- Helen!
Helen!
James... are you her husband?
Uh... I will be.
We're... we're getting married.
If I could have a quick word?
Helen has suffered major
internal injuries, James.
Helen has lost her baby,
I'm afraid, Gerry.
I'm afraid she's lost her baby.
You did know
she was pregnant?
Did you know
she was pregnant?
She'll be OK, though,
won't she?
She is going to wake up,
isn't she, doctor?
Helen, for some reason,
I know you can hear me.
I'm glad we got things
sorted out tonight.
I'm glad you caught
the train that day.
I am going to make you
so happy.
I promise.
Helen?
Can you hear me?
Could you hear me, Helen?
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Oh, no problem.
Your mother's showing some signs
of improvement this morning.
She's sitting up,
and she's had a full breakfast.
That's great.
Helen, I swear I...
- I'll do anything you want, darling.
- Will you?
In that case,
I want you to stand up...
walk over to the door...
open it, walk through it,
and close it behind you.
Ta-ta, mum.
# Mama, where's your pretty
little girl tonight... #
- Call us if you have any problems.
- Thank you.
You're very fortunate, Helen.
You had a lucky escape.
You can say that again.
# She's got a young man waitin'
# Yes, she's grown up
# She's got a young man waitin'
# She's wide-eyed
# She'll be streetwise
# To the lies
# And the jive talk
# But she'll find true love
# And tenderness on the block
# But she'll find true love
# And tenderness on the block
# She was wide-eyed
# Now she's streetwise
To the lies... #
Thank you.
Cheer up. You know
what the Monty Python boys say.
Nobody expects
a Spanish Inquisition.
# And tenderness on the block
# Yeah, she's gonna find true love
# She's gonna find true love
# She's gonna find true love #
# My tea has gone cold,
I'm wonderin' why I
# Got out of bed at all
# The mornin' rain clouds at my window
# And I can't see at all
# And even if I could it'd all be grey
# Put your picture on my wall
# It reminds me that it's not so bad
# It's not so bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
# I drank too much last night
# Got bills to pay
# My head just feels in pain
# I miss the bus and there'll be hell today
# I'm late for work again
# And even if I'm there,
they'll all imply
# That I might not last the day
# And then you call me
# And it's not so bad
It's not so bad
# And I
# Want to thank you
# For givin' me the best day
# Of my life
# Ohh
# Just to be with you
# Is having the best day
# Of my life
# Push the door, I'm home at last
# And I'm soaking through and through
# Then you handed me a towel
# And all I see is you
# And even if my house
falls down now
# I wouldn't have a clue
# Because you're near me
# And I
# Want to thank you
# For giving me the best day
# Of my life
# And, oh
# Just to be with you
# Is having the best day
# Of my life
# And I
# Want to thank you
# For giving me the best day
# Of my life
# Ohh
# Just to be with you
# Is having the best day
of my life #
