Willie C. What's up?
- Hey, fellas.
- What's goin' on?
You never went home last night?
Came here. Pike is runnin'.
Haven't caught a thing.
- Guess what I did this morning.
- What?
Made a phone call to Stinky's cousin,
the lovely Andera.
- What happened?
- She's going out with me. Thank you.
Like on a date?
We didn't get into specifics.
Jealous?
- Well...
- A little bit.
Come on, Elle. Let's get some air.
Jesus!
Is that Mo?
Fuckin' Mo has got it wired, man.
He's like a retard
that doesn't know any better.
He doesn't desire new experiences,
new women, nothing. Look at him.
He's like the mental patient
that doesn't know he's mental.
So he's perfectly content.
- I gotta go take a piss.
- I'll see you later.
Hey!
I'll see you later.
What the heck are you doing here?
My friends are ice fishing
in the shack over there.
Those guys are your friends?
- You know 'em?
- They're here every Sunday.
We call them the Drunken Dry-heavin'
Cheese-eatin' Outhouse Boys.
They're your friends?
- They're acquaintances, really.
- Right.
- So, where's Scooter?
- Who?
What's his name? Billy? Tiger?
Pookie? The kid on the bike?
- Andrew?
- Andrew, that's it. Where is he?
He dorked out on me.
I'm not into him any more.
Ah. So you got someone new?
Yep. You!
What?
You. You're my new boyfriend.
You up to it?
Oh, I feel faint!
My hero.
So you gonna marry that girl in NYC?
I don't know. Why?
- I don't think you should.
- How come?
You should wait until
you meet someone who excites you.
Well, she may not be out there.
It's like the Wizard of Oz.
It was in your own backyard.
What do you mean?
You. Me and you.
- Really?
- Yep. You don't think?
Well, we have a little age problem.
I know. We're as star-crossed
as Romeo and Juliet.
It's a tragedy
of Elizabethan proportions.
"What light
through yonder window breaks?
"Tis the east
and Juliet is the sun."
- Weird.
- No way.
So, um... So what do we do?
Alas, poor Romeo, we can't do diddly.
You'll go to penitentiary,
I'll be the laughing stock
of the Brownies.
But if your feelings for me are true,
you'll wait.
Wait?
Yep. Wait 5 years.
I'll be 18 and we can walk
through this world together.
- In 5 years you won't remember me.
- William.
I'm formed and you're not.
You have changes to go through.
You'll change.
And I'll be Winnie The Pooh
to your Christopher Robin.
No literary reference left unturned.
How do you figure Pooh?
Christopher Robin outgrew Pooh.
That's how it ended.
He had Pooh when he was a child.
When he matured,
he didn't need him any more.
That's the saddest thing
I ever heard.
Yeah, but it's true.
You don't realise it now,
but you'll be doing some changing.
And...
I can't be a Pooh.
- I think I'll skate away now, Pooh.
- All right, Christopher.
- Hey, Earl.
- Hey, good one!
Sit down here. It's a better view.
So, where are your buddies?
- Huh?
- Your buddies?
Oh, they're gonna be late.
Hi. A bottle
of your best champagne, please.
We don't have a best champagne.
They're all the same.
Thank you. That'll be fine.
You really look nice.
- What is going on?
- What do you mean?
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What's with this Al Capone shit?
- What Al Capone shit?
Who's the girl?
- What girl?
- That girl right over there.
She's... She's my book-keeper.
- Your book-keeper?
- Yes.
- You are full of shit.
- She's very efficient, that girl.
Paul, I'm gonna get up and make
the biggest scene you can imagine.
She's my cousin. We fell out
and we don't speak in public.
- Bye, Paul. I'm leaving.
- All right, all right.
She's my ex-girlfriend.
We broke up after seven years
because she's seeing
that meat cutter over there.
It drives me crazy, OK? And...
I was just showing off.
Why didn't you just tell me?
Just please don't make a scene.
Oh, we'll make a scene.
You don't need this.
Who is that?
- It's Paul.
- No shit.
- Who's the babe?
- I don't know.
She's gorgeous.
Well, not gorgeous like you.
- Gorgeous just the same.
- Can we leave?
Sure.
Fuck!
- Andera, where you goin'?
- Home.
- Why?
- That was for you.
I was trying to help you out.
You're such a knucklehead.
- Come back inside.
- Bye, Paul.
- Andera...
- Bye, Paul.
- Come on.
- Bye, Paul.
I'll call you tomorrow, all right?
- She likes fresh air, you know?
- Sure.
Hey, what you doin' out so late?
I was out with your friend Paul.
He's not my friend,
he lives in my house.
I got roaches,
I got termites and I got Paul.
- You need a lift?
- No.
It's nice to be able
to walk after dark.
Yeah, it's one of the few perks
of living here.
It's a good one.
Can I ask a question? How long have
you been with your boyfriend?
- Eight months.
- And it's good?
It's very good.
He makes you happy?
Yeah.
I look for that in a man. The ones
who make me miserable never last.
Right.
There's four words I need to hear
before I go to sleep. Four words.
Good night, sweet girl.
That's all it takes.
I'm easy, I know.
But a guy who can muster up those
words is a guy I'll stay with.
Right. You sure
you don't need a ride?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- See you around.
- I'll see you.
Good night, sweet girl.
I spoke to Jan this morning
and it's obvious she no longer cares.
She ran out of that restaurant
like a maniac, but I guess later,
she realised she didn't give a shit.
Yeah?
I spoke to Tracy.
She's coming up for the reunion.
Is that right?
I gotta meet this Tracy.
- You got to take this shit down.
- Why?
- You're like a serial killer.
- Don't cap on my supermodels.
- Leave it alone.
- It's creepy.
Look who's talking,
Mr Jerry Lee Lewis.
Oh, fucking Mo!
I don't judge. If she can cut
her own food, she's fair game.
OK. All I'm saying is you got to take
all this down because it's creepy...
Look. The supermodel's a beautiful
girl, Will. She can make you dizzy,
like you've been drinking
Jack all morning.
She can make you feel high for
the greatest commodity known to man -
promise, the promise of a better day,
the promise of a greater hope,
the promise of a new tomorrow.
This particular ore can be found
in the gait of a beautiful girl -
in her smile, in her soul,
in the way she makes every rotten
thing about life seem OK.
The supermodels, Willie? That's all
they are - bottled promise.
Scenes from a new day,
hope in stiletto heels.
I am now going to
check your freezer for human heads.
A beautiful girl's all-powerful
and that is as good as love.
That's as good as love.
It's...
just that I gotta think
beyond a couple times a week.
I feel like
the biggest scumbag on earth
every time
I see your kid smiling at me.
Look, Mommy.
That's nice, honey.
It's ridiculous.
It's making me nuts.
It's making you nuts.
Sharon, Steven...
I have worked it
so that he has no idea.
That's cos I don't show up
at your parties drunk.
- Sharon knew way before then.
- Maybe Steve doesn't give a shit.
Tommy, don't try to characterise
my marriage as a bad one.
- I love Steven.
- So why are you fucking me?
I don't know.
But I guess I won't be any more.
No. I guess not.
I wonder how I'll survive.
Oh, please!
I told Steven
the reunion would be a total bore.
And I assume Sharon
won't be accompanying you, right?
No, you've taken care of that.
- Mom.
- What?
OK, sweetie. Come on.
We'll go home, OK?
All right, put the other arm in.
OK. Very good.
Look. It'll be great.
We'll be there alone.
It'll be just like the old days.
And we'll see if you really
just broke up with me or not.
Let's go, honey.
Hey.
How you doin'?
Want some wine to warm you up?
Sure.
Thanks, Stan.
That was nice. Really nice.
Less intense and emotionally
possessed than normal,
but no less effective because
of its pointless colouration.
Excuse me?
My teacher's exact comment after
my first recital - Rhapsody In Blue.
When in doubt, go Gershwin.
You drunk?
I don't know
but you both look beautiful.
So why the sad face?
Job requirement.
Happy piano players work the circus.
I think you Knight's Ridge boys
take the ladies way too seriously.
Only until baseball season starts.
Pitchers and catchers report in
two months, three weeks and six days.
- Wanna go home with me?
- No.
OK, I had to ask. To be honest,
I don't find you at all attractive.
- Really?
- Really.
- So now you wanna go home with me?
- No.
- Well, I tried every angle.
- Job requirement.
Exactly.
Play something else.
You don't like this boozy,
after-hours musician banter?
Can't dance to it.
You'd be surprised.
OK, you've spurned
both my sexual advances,
my attempts at conversation, so I'm
gonna reach into my bag of tricks...
- Wanna go ice fishing?
- I'd love to.
Great.
You know how it is at the beginnings
when you first fall in love?
You can't eat. You can't sleep.
Getting a call from her makes your
day, like seeing a shooting star.
- It's the best.
- But inevitably, it goes away.
So, this is my thing, you see.
Why get married now? Why not have
two, three more of those beginnings
before I settle into the big fade?
The big fade?
That's an awful way to put it.
- She's coming tomorrow.
- That's obvious.
I got no feeling about that. I got a
feeling of overwhelming ambivalence.
But I would rather dread her arrival
than not give a shit.
It's amazing that there's a guy
that gets to do things with you.
He gets to make you happy,
spend evenings with you...
Make me martinis,
listen to Van Morrison...
- Smell your skin...
...after a day at the beach.
- And read the papers...
...on a Sunday morning.
A rainy Sunday morning. And pepper
your belly with baby kisses.
Sorry...
There's a guy out there that
thinks the same thing about Tracy.
He's jealous of you,
you getting to do all that with her.
Can you think of anything better than
making love to an attractive stranger
on a frozen lake with
just an oil light to guide your way?
Can you think of anything better?
Going back to Chicago.
Ice-cold martini. Van Morrison.
Sunday papers. Got you.
I gotta go.
Hey.
Why do I feel
like I'll never see you again?
You'll see me again, Willie.
Damn.
Hi.
You look awful.
- I've been drunk for two weeks.
- Nice.
- How was it, the drive?
- The roads were awful. Sheet ice.
You got here safe.
I'll make you some tea.
That was delicious.
Really superb, Tracy.
- Thank you.
- The fact that you can cook,
rolled into the fact
that you're a successful lawyer
and the fact that you are stunning
to look at, just makes me insane.
Bobby!
I'm flattered, Bobby.
It really was superb, Tracy.
- All right, we're gonna shower...
- Why?
We're going over to Mo's
for a pre-bash thing. Why?
You want to shower first or should I?
Why don't you shower first, Will?
We can take the rest
of the time to bond.
- Go ahead. I'll be fine.
- Superb.
It really was superb, Tracy.
Hey!
Romeo And Juliet,
the dyslexic version.
- What are you doing?
- Another exciting Saturday night.
You got many exciting Saturday nights
in your future.
Yeah. Yeah.
- So your lady's here, huh?
- Yeah.
I saw her. She's really pretty.
She's OK. She's not as pretty
as you, though.
Got that boob thing
going for her, though.
And she can get into R-rated movies.
Two words not in her vocabulary -
"lunch money".
Hey, Marty.
I hope we stay in touch.
Cos I hope to learn
someday about what you're doing.
Cos I think whatever it is,
it'll be amazing.
I really do.
Thank you.
You got it.
- It was great.
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- Thank you for coming.
- Trace, we gotta get going.
Bye.
- Take care, now. Be careful!
- Stay warm, guys.
Bye.
It's unbelievable. They haven't liked
anyone since Steve McQueen died.
- You just...
- They're nice.
Nice. They're as far away
from nice as...
If nice is London, they are Tokyo.
OK.
You're nice.
I can't believe you're not gonna go.
I'm laying low. You have fun.
You loved high school. Everybody's
gonna wonder what happened.
So tell them I'm in Geneva,
doing my presentation
on sub-zero water removal.
You just wanna sit here like a loser.
Channel 38's showing
Rich Man, Poor Man - all 12 parts.
- No shit?
- Back to back.
Holy shit. Fuck!
Fuck!
364 nights a year I do dick.
The one night I decide to go out...
You gotta tape it for me.
- Can't do it.
- Why not?
You can't tape Rich Man, Poor Man.
You gotta watch it with the
commercials just like everybody else.
That's a good point.
Falcon Eddie.
Man, was there ever a more terrifying
screen villain than Falcon Eddie?
No.
- You're gonna watch it?
- Yep.
- All 12 parts?
- Back to back.
Shit.
It's a tough call. You're a bastard.
Yep.
Oh, shit...
Don't drink too much punch.
Stanley, you kill me.
- How does that work?
- That's not what I practise...
- You want some more?
- Yeah.
Tracy. Hey, Paul. You good?
So, listen... I like this.
She makes those herself.
Mohammed, one white wine, please.
- Willie, she is delightful.
- Delightful? Are you Rex Harrison?
She's amazing.
What is your malfunction?
She's smart, she's funny,
she's got a great ass, nice rack...
- Nice rack.
- She's charming, rich, great ass...
- You mentioned that.
- It's that good, Will.
- Hey, Frank?
- Hey, Tommy.
- Get a Bud?
- Sure.
- You're beautiful.
- Always room for improvement.
Do you know who you look like?
Ally Sheedy.
Do you know Ally Sheedy?
Whatever happened to her?
She was in The Breakfast Club
with the Estevez brothers.
- That's right.
- I've never seen her since.
- Did you ever see Misery?
- No.
- Cos you remind me of Kathy Bates.
- Oh, don't you say that!
Did you hear Andera
went back to Chicago?
She was supposed to stay
for the reunion, but she just left.
Really?
What did you do to her in that shack?
I told you, we just talked.
- You told her things, didn't you?
- What things?
- You let her behind the curtain.
- Maybe she missed her boyfriend.
You let her
behind the curtain. I know.
Never let 'em behind, Will.
You never let them see the old man
working the levers of the great Oz.
They're all sisters, Willie.
They aren't allowed back there.
They mustn't see.
Tell me the truth. You stay up nights
thinking about this shit?
You say it like it's a bad thing.
Hi, Darian. Good to see you.
Susan.
...and your last name?
- Smalls.
Say, didn't you used to be
Darian Smalls?
- That's right.
- I'm Peter Gropeman. Remember me?
No.
I used to have a weight problem.
You called me Peter the Eater.
- You made me cry in seventh grade.
- I did?
I'm sorry.
You here alone?
- Yeah, I guess I am.
- That's weird. Darian Smalls alone.
God you were something
in those days.
You were beautiful.
But if you don't mind me saying,
mean as a snake.
You were as mean as a snake.
Hello, Tom.
Steve.
How come you're not at the reunion?
- Wasn't into it.
- Won't Darian be disappointed?
- Did she go?
- Yeah.
- That's nice.
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, I got one.
- Come on, Tom. One drink.
I was just gonna be leaving.
OK.
Let me see if I got this straight.
I can't buy you a drink, but you can
stick your dick into my wife.
- Frank, shot of rye.
- Two.
See, I think it's Knight's Ridge.
Fucking working-class towns, man.
Girls here see a tool belt,
they get moist.
I got an extra one
I can lend you, Steve.
Hook you up
with some vice grips, ratchet...
Don't fuck with me, man.
Don't worry about them, either.
This is me and you.
You know, I don't think it is, Steve.
You don't strike me as the type
who fights his own battles,
but I give you
the benefit of the doubt.
I tell you what. Drink your shot,
go back to your boys,
play quarters, whatever you frat boys
do and I'll get out of your hair.
Thanks, Frank.
- You couldn't leave it alone.
- That's right, mother...
Fuck. You.
- Let's go.
- Fuckin' lowlife.
Fuckin' showed him.
Shit!
- Michael!
- What?
Frank just called.
Tommy got the shit kicked out of him.
- By who?
- Let's go.
- I don't think you should.
- Sarah, not now, OK? Come on.
I'm goin'. Come on.
- Will? Willie?
- Go.
- Where is he?
- He didn't want me to call the cops.
Thanks.
- Who the fuck did this?
- Calm down, Mo.
Frank, who did this?
Rossmore. He and his buddies.
- Where are you goin'?
- To find Rossmore.
- Suddenly, he's Charles Bronson.
- Get him to a hospital. Come on.
It's snowing. I can't believe
I'm gonna have to plough tonight.
Tommy was sleeping with his wife.
So?
It's not like he was that innocent.
So he deserved that?
You see his face?
Look, this does present
a moral dilemma.
All right, fuck him.
Let's lynch the bastard.
You got a plan?
No plan.
- Think he's here?
- I don't know.
- Fucking douchebag, man.
- Easy, Mo.
Take it easy.
You fuck with my friend,
you fuck with me!
Beat up my friend, you beat up me!
You fuck with me, you fuck with you!
You get mad when you drink,
you don't drink!
- What are you talking about?
- Don't talk back.
- What?
- We got company.
The cavalry has arrived. Assholes.
Car trouble, fellas?
I didn't even see you!
Now, where were we, shithead?
Daddy, what's going on?
I'm just trying to save
my family here, man, all right?
- Just stay away from us, Stevie.
- Come on.
Hey, darlin', just go back inside.
I'll be right in.
OK.
- All right?
- Yeah, let's get outta here.
Fuckin' kids comin' out and shit...
- What did you say?
- Just babbling.
See you, fellas.
- How is he?
- I don't know.
- What did they say?
- They didn't say nothin'.
- How are you?
- You guys do your macho things?
We just went over
and Mo pushed him around a bit.
- Did you tell Annie we'd be late?
- Yeah. I told her to sleep over.
- That was good.
- You OK?
Yeah.
- I'm sorry.
- Just don't...
- I'm sorry.
- I know.
I love you, baby.
Miss, would you check
on room 309, please?
- You haven't heard anything?
- Here we go.
- Who called her?
- I don't know.
Who do you think? Me.
- What's up?
- He's gonna be OK.
He has a concussion, two broken ribs
and took about 30 stitches.
- But he's gonna be OK?
- Yeah. He's gonna be fine.
He said it's snowing
and that somebody should...
...sand his lots. Got it.
Go get 'em, Kev.
- I'll be by tomorrow to say goodbye.
- Wait. Where are you goin'?
We're going back tomorrow.
- Just like that?
- Just like that.
Is the couch OK?
Yeah, yeah. It's fine.
Sorry about tonight.
- I had fun.
- Yeah?
It's pretty lively around here.
So how come
you're coming back with me?
I don't know. Cos I want to.
- I'm not gonna take that sales job.
- I don't think you should.
- How come?
- Piano players are sexy.
Salesmen are uncles.
And uncles aren't sexy.
Not usually.
Wait, wait. This is so weird.
You've never had sex in here before?
Not with another person.
So...
So how are you holding up?
Are you in pain?
I'm OK.
You look nice.
Thanks. I was on a date.
- Did you have fun?
- It was OK.
It's weird.
What is?
I'm just lying here
and I'm wondering...
how I got here, you know?
I don't mean here,
I mean how I got here...
How I'm not anything like...
what I'd hoped that I'd be,
you know?
I'm not even close to the guy
I thought I'd end up being.
And it kind of blows.
You know?
When I think about that guy
that I thought I was gonna be...
there's a...
there's this girl next to him,
with him...
and I don't know...
she looks sorta like you.
- Sorta?
- Exactly.
Exactly sorta.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You look excellent.
Did you guys fuck up Rossmore?
No, we put the fear of God into him.
He was a real shit.
- He had a right to be pissed.
- How's she doing?
She's fine.
Yeah. You're not gonna fuck it up
with her, are you?
What do you think?
She's one of the good ones. Why
do we always fuck up the good ones?
I don't know.
I've been pretty successful at it.
Listen, I just came by
to say goodbye.
- I'm taking off.
- Taking off?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Listen, maybe
I'll come down and visit.
Yeah, right. Like, what, spring?
- Spring.
- Spring.
Hey.
- Don't be a stranger.
- All right. Take care of each other.
Right.
- Surprise!
- Oh, shit!
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Tough guy, how you feelin'?
- I've been better. You takin' off?
Yeah, I'm goin' home.
- Listen, say goodbye to Sarah.
- Say goodbye to Tracy.
You figure any of that shit out?
You know. I'm working on it.
Good.
- I better get in there.
- See you soon.
All right, buddy. I love you, man.
How you doin', bud?
- I'm not used to this snow.
- How long is the drive?
About five or six hours.
If he drives, for sure five...
- You'll have nice weather.
- It won't be too bad.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.
- Front or back?
- Back is good.
Word is Jan and Victor
are engaged, Willie.
- How do you feel?
- She drains me. They're all sisters.
Each and every one.
- Yo, Willie boy.
- Hey.
- So you outta here?
- Yep.
She is a honey-limbed lovely.
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.
- Have a safe ride.
- Trace.
This is Marty. Marty, Tracy.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- You, too.
- OK. Take care, big guy.
- Thanks.
See you.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye, Marty.
Later, Pooh.
Come back and see us, Will.
We'll be right here.
Nothing changes here but the seasons.
So you're
the little neighbourhood Lolita?
So you're the alcoholic,
high school buddy shit-for-brains?
That little girl was cute.
What was her name? Marcy?
No, no. Marty.
- Is it Martha?
- No, as in Martin.
Named after a grandfather
she never even knew.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I am.
Superb.
Willie C!
Take care, man.
Stay cool. Stay cool forever.
All right, Kev.
