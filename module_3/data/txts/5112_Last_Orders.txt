And love to wander

'Bye, Lenny. You look nice.
Don't go near the barrow.
Lenny, leave it.
I'll do it. Your clothes.
Put your coat on.
See you whenever, lads.
-See you, Dad.
-Take it easy, Dad.
Here, Vic, don't forget this.
'Bye, Kath.
I'm sorry, Vince.
Leave it out.
I'm doing you a favor, Dad, ain't I?
Don't work here anymore, remember?
Won't be the same, will it?
Won't be the same.
You ain't seen the last of him yet, Bern.
You what?
I said, you ain't seen the last of Jack yet.
'Course, Ray.
It's on me, Lenny.
Pint?
This is a turn-up.
New timetable, is it?
'Morning, Bern.
Retired now, are we, Lenny?
No, I'm past the age for it, ain't I?
Not like Raysy here, man of leisure.
Fruit and veg trade needs me.
But not today?
You haven't told him?
No.
So, we're going to Tucker's, yeah?
-No, Vic's coming here.
-Eh?
Vic's coming here. With Jack.
Drink up.
'Morning. Fresh out.
Is that it? Is that him?
That's him.
-What are we drinking?
-What's inside?
What do you think?
Mine's a whisky. I think it's a whisky day.
I mean, he's not just in a box, is he?
No, Lenny, he's not just in a box.
Here you go.
Doesn't seem possible, does it?
-lt's heavy, isn't it?
-Packed solid.
Is this just him? I mean, is this all of him?
Where's Bernie got to?
Jesus, Lucky,
and they reckoned you was pint-sized.
Bern?
What's that?
It's Jack. Jack's ashes.
-That's Jack?
-Yeah.
Jesus God, what's he doing here?
Last orders, Bernie.
-Not like the ones you're used to, eh?
-Yeah, you know what they are.
Didn't anyone tell you, Bern?
Jack wanted to go to Margate.
Be scattered in the sea.
So we thought we should have
a last look-in at the Coach.
I see.
Get me a large scotch, Bernie,
and one for yourself.
I will. Thanks, Vic.
No, no.
It's on the house.
-On the house.
-Cheers, cheers.
-lt ain't every day, is it?
-No.
Yeah, Jesus God.
To think he was just sitting there,
six weeks ago.
Well, here's to him.
Jack.
Right, lads, whose shout?
As if you didn't know.
Just testing.
You blokes would die of thirst without me,
wouldn't you?
Same again, Bernie.
Here, look at the form on this one.
Cheers, darling.
Don't you go coming on to us.
We're all married men here.
-Some of us happily.
-Speak for yourself.
Come on, Gunner.
Where would you be without your Joaney?
"Always pissed and always late."
No, where would any of us be
without our better halves?
All right, darling?
Listen,
if you fancy little fellas like Lucky here...
...that is a different matter.
There is no Mrs. Raysy.
You'd be doing us all a favor.
He's been on his own too long.
Got set in his ways.
All right, Raysy, all right.
I think you could be
in there with a show, Luck?
Well....
Point taken, Bernie.
Not much good for business, is it?
Not doing yours any favors either, Vic.
Here's to you, Vic.
You did a really good job on Thursday.
Yeah, the funeral went a treat, Vic.
-Don't mention it.
-Yeah.
How's Amy?
Managing.
-She ain't changed her mind about coming?
-No.
She'll be with June as usual.
Her decision, ain't it?
Oh, yeah.
Hi.
-I'm going upstairs.
-Right.
All we need now is our chauffeur.
Well, they're playing his song.
Wonder what he'll bring.
Seems to drive...
...a different car every week,
as far as I can see.
Same again all round?
That'll be him. That'll be Vincey.
Ain't he coming in?
No, I think young Master Dodds
wants us out there.
Jesus Christ.
It's a Merc.
Trust Big Boy.
Jesus, it's a Merc.
I just wanted to do Jack proud.
You know, give him a treat.
This has been stuck in my showroom
for the past week, anyhow.
I just thought the old man, Jack,
should get the best.
I mean, look at it.
Goes along as sweet as a nut, doesn't it?
About as sweet as your aftershave,
Big Boy.
Don't put a dent in it!
-Don't want to lose you a sale, do we?
-All right, relax, Lenny.
What do you do
when you're out in the hearse, Vic?
When you're going on a motorway?
-You step on it.
-Don't encourage him, Vic.
A hearse is different. Everyone makes way
for a hearse, don't they?
You mean they don't make way
for Vince here?
Busman's holiday, Vic?
Oh, babe.
Where's my kiss then?
No, you got to throw a bucket of water
over them first, Jack.
It's young love.
Mandy, how about a kiss for me, darling?
'Course, Jack. Come here then.
Come on, let the dog see the rabbit here.
And get out of here.
Take this clown with you.
I'm sorry, chaps. I've got to bail out.
Because needs must.
Well, you ain't 40 every day, are you, Jack?
Only comes once, eh, Lenny?
Come on then, birthday boy.
-You want a promise.
-Yeah, give us a minute.
Happy birthday, Son. Good to see you.
'Night, chaps.
'Night, Jack.
-Last orders.
-Coach is leaving.
You dropped some money.
-Last orders.
-But it ain't going anywhere as usual.
Never does, does it?
-What are you on about, Raysy?
-Here. Come here.
Well, I'm saying
it's the Coach & Horses, but...
...it's never gone anywhere, has it?
Still ain't a car built yet
that can beat a jam, is there, Big Boy?
Did Amy say why she ain't going and all?
Makes no difference, does it?
Jack's none the wiser.
I told Amy, if she wanted to scatter
the ashes in the cemetery garden...
...he'd be none the wiser, either.
-You an undertaker!
-You shouldn't judge.
-Ashes is ashes.
-And best to do things prompt.
-And wishes is wishes.
-How do we know he'll be none the wiser?
Not that I would have been such a fool
as to make such a wish myself.
Well, it weren't that specific.
What wasn't specific?
What he wrote. About his wishes.
He didn't say that Amy had to do it,
he just said what he wanted done.
Well, how do you know that?
"To whom it may concern.
"To whom it may concern.
"Last orders.
"...and my ashes taken forthwith...."
This is all a bit formal for old Jack, ain't it?
"From the end of Margate pier"?
Margate?
Suppose he thought he'd get there
in the end. One way or the other.
When did he write it?
It was a couple of days before.
Well, why didn't he just tell you?
I suppose he thought
that I'd think he was joking.
I mean that way he makes it proper.
Well, if you want to do it, Amy,
I'll take you.
-What, in the old camper?
-Yeah, 'course.
No.
I can't do it, Ray.
I mean, thank you, but...
...I don't want to.
It's a dying man's request, Amy.
Would you do it, Ray?
That way it gets done, doesn't it?
That way his last wish gets carried out.
It only says,
"To whom it may concern" anyway.
All right, I'll do it.
Yeah, 'course I'll do it. What about Vince?
I haven't told Vincey. Not about this.
Well, I mean, I will, but...
...maybe you and him could....
I'll talk to Vince.
And maybe Lenny and Vic
will want to go as well.
It's not even like his writing, is it?
Moment's come, Ray.
Time to sell up the shop.
Well, there's more to life than bacon,
ain't there?
It's only fair on Amy.
I never made my mind up till about,
well, five minutes ago.
I was swabbing down those trays.
You know what today is?
June's 50th birthday.
June 1, 1939.
And it's Amy's day for seeing her.
She asked me to go, of course.
Well, she never said nothing,
but I knew what she was thinking.
Fifty years is special or it ain't.
So, you know, I said to her:
"I'll close up early
and I'll see you down there."
I mean, I wasn't saying anything definite...
...but it was still like a promise.
But when the time came...
...a couple of hours ago...
-...I couldn't change.
-Yeah.
Not like that.
So, I thought I could change
in another way.
I can tell her something.
Something to compensate.
I can tell her I'm packing it in.
Look who it ain't.
-lt's Mr. Rest In Peace.
-At your disposal.
-Business slow?
-By no means lively.
-No lodgers?
-Just the one. We going down the Coach?
I hope so. There's something to celebrate.
-What's that?
-Guess.
No, you can't say that.
I've got to tell Amy first.
When he told me,
he looked at me as if I'd be dead chuffed...
...as if he wasn't looking at the woman
he'd been looking at for 50 years.
See what I'm saying, girl? I'm jacking it in.
You get it? Jacking it in?
I thought maybe we'd get a bungalow
by the seaside.
Margate, maybe.
<i>Margate, where it all went wrong.</i>
<i>Because he couldn't stand that</i>
<i>his daughter, that our June, wasn't normal.</i>
-Margate.
-Yeah, Margate.
Yeah, well, what about June?
That's my point. If I can give up
being Jack Dodds, family butcher...
...you can give up going on
this fool's errand every week.
<i>Fool's errand.</i>
That's what he called it, "Fool's errand."
So we were going to be--
New people. Happy days.
New people.
In Margate?
I don't think we could've done it.
Not when you totted it all up.
Not when you took away
what he owed on the shop.
We would've been a fair bit short.
Don't know where that leaves me.
-How much short, Amy?
-lt's about £20,000.
Next stop, Fairfax Park.
Fairfax Park.
<i>...13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</i>
<i>Stop, stop, stop.</i>
<i>...13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</i>
<i>Stop, stop, stop.</i>
<i>This is getting very silly.</i>
Hello, June.
<i>Well, it doesn't look like</i>
<i>a serious sort of shoe to me.</i>
<i>I'm sure there are lots of things</i>
<i>one can use one's shoe for.</i>
<i>I can think of one.</i>
<i>Can you, Charlie?</i>
Amy's seeing June.
It's her day for seeing June.
She could leave one day off.
I mean, it's not like it's a normal day,
is it, really?
Raysy here is a mine
of information, isn't he?
It's like the horses.
Have to prise it out of him these days.
Is that getting heavy, Vic?
You want me to take it for a bit?
-No, it's fine, Ray.
-But even then he gives you duff tips.
Here, last tip I gave came good.
Well, it weren't for any of us.
Who, Raysy?
That'd be telling, wouldn't it?
<i>And the whole world thought</i>
<i>that Jack Dodds...</i>
...had finally seen the light...
...and decided to start a new life.
What the world didn't know...
What the world didn't know...
...was that I'd taken out a loan
to save the shop, five years ago.
And it comes up. In a month.
That wouldn't be a problem.
I sell the house, I sell the shop...
...I buy a small tin-pot bungalow in
Margate and scrape by on the remainder.
Except that's all off now, isn't it?
All bets are off, aren't they?
How much?
Well, it was seven large when I took it on...
-...but now they want £20,000.
-You're joking?
No, we're not talking bank managers,
you know, here.
It's a special loan. Private loan.
Not Vince?
No, no.
Vince wouldn't lend me money
if I was dying.
Well, if you can't see
what is right under your nose....
There's a new supermarket
just down the road...
...and they've offered you first refusal
to be their new meat manager.
-You've got no choice, have you?
-Haven't I?
Well, that's down to you, Dad.
That's your funeral.
Don't come running back to me.
Don't expect me to lay out any money.
At least I'd be my own man.
Your own man?
You never was your own man.
You was your old man's man, weren't you?
That cuts both ways, doesn't it?
That should have been our shop.
Dad, just don't expect me to bail you out.
I ain't got it.
Bit of a dry argument over here, Jack.
Wouldn't be your shout, would it?
There's a tenner.
Buy your mates a drink, a couple of drinks.
Buy yourself one. I'm going home.
So who?
Some of Vince's pals from the old days.
Business pals.
Rough stuff. Understand?
You look like you're begging
with that bowl there.
Yeah.
It's Amy I'm thinking about, Raysy.
When l, you know....
She might want to stay put or want to
go through with the bungalow anyway.
It ain't been kiboshed yet.
She might have other plans.
Either way...
...I don't want to see a debt collector
knocking at her front door.
Hello, Nurse.
Do you know my friend Ray, Kelly?
Yeah.
Take his pulse, it's faster than mine.
You'd be all right there.
You don't change, do you?
I need a winner, Raysy.
I need a winner.
I need it
like I've never needed anything before.
Here.
Feel in there. Get that out.
Yeah, in there. There, look.
-What, this?
-Yeah. It's got 1,000 smackers in it.
Eight hundred in fifties,
and the rest in twenties.
You got £1,000 in readies
in a place like this? What are you doing?
Who's going to nick it in here?
These poor bastards?
-Well, where did you get it?
-Well, that'd be telling, wouldn't it?
Open it. Count it.
-No, I trust you.
-No, open it. Open it.
It's a thick 'un, Jack.
£1,000 to get £20,000.
It's a thick 'un.
What if I put it on the wrong nag?
You can't, can you?
Amy needs it.
Think of it...
...as buying a camper.
£1,000. Remember?
You didn't want to sell it to me, did you?
The camper.
Can anyone tell me, why Margate?
That's where we used to go
on our Sunday outings.
Here, Lenny, remember the old meat van?
You think I don't remember, Big Boy?
What with our Sally and all.
Yeah, she used to love her Sunday outings
to Margate, while they lasted.
<i>Hello, Sally.</i>
-See you tonight, Lenny.
-Sal, don't forget your basket.
Sally, behave yourself. Have a good time.
-We'll have a beer, Len.
-Ta-ta, Sally.
They are getting like brother and sister,
aren't they?
Yeah, one big happy family.
Or so Amy would like to think.
Sally, wave to Mummy. Wave.
As if we wouldn't take her to the beach
if we could.
See you, Lenny. Joan.
Poor Lenny.
I know what it's like not to be able
to take your daughter to the sea.
<i>Vincey. Sally.</i>
Sal, come on, come here.
What is that? What is that?
<i>It's not the same as having your own</i>
<i>daughter there, but it helped.</i>
-There's a swan. See it?
-Yeah.
<i>It was good while it lasted.</i>
Little Sally got too big though.
Too big for our little meat van.
<i>Vincey's little playmate</i>
<i>was growing up fast.</i>
<i>And don't think</i>
<i>that Vincey wasn't noticing.</i>
<i>Little beggar.</i>
<i>No more front seat for Vincey.</i>
You got too big, lad.
Then Vincey goes and throws up
all over the picnic things.
You all right, lad?
Come on.
<i>And no more Margate for Sally Tate.</i>
It's a long way from a meat van to a Merc.
And this ain't no Sunday outing.
Do you think he was just trying it on?
Just to see if we'd do it?
So you think he knows.
You think he can still see us, don't you?
'Course he can't see us.
He can't see nothing.
Mind you, Big Boy...
...if he can't see us, if he can't see nothing,
why did you go and bring a Merc?
It's the gesture, Lenny.
It's a nice gesture. It's a beautiful car.
It ain't no meat van.
Margate.
Uncle Bert hocked his grandfather clock
so Jack and I could go to Margate.
First time.
Margate. For the weekend.
No! Don't ask, all fixed.
Just get your old man to give you
the time off. Say it's your honeymoon.
Steamer from Tower Bridge.
What do you think?
Well, it's easy to believe when you're 18
that you can make a fresh start.
The world doesn't have to come to an end
just because....
I think I came as close as I ever did
to ditching June then.
I wanted to know that...
<i>...if he didn't want her,</i>
<i>at least he wanted me.</i>
<i>It's where they had their honeymoon.</i>
Margate.
That's why.
I didn't think they had no honeymoon.
I thought they were saving up
for a pram at the time.
Yeah, they had a honeymoon later,
after June was born.
Yeah, he's right.
Summer of '39.
<i>Must have been some honeymoon.</i>
You can pick your chocolate, your china,
or your teddy bear.
<i>You'd think they could do something</i>
<i>these days.</i>
Think they could come up with something.
<i>It was the only time</i>
<i>he ever talked about her.</i>
<i>Couldn't face the fact that his daughter</i>
<i>"didn't have all her marbles"...</i>
<i>...as he so bluntly put it.</i>
I had this idea once...
...this stupid idea of being a doctor.
But I ain't, am I?
No more than you is
bloody Florence Nightingale.
The best thing we can do, Amy...
...is forget all about her.
<i>Put her away.</i>
<i>Out of sight, out of mind.</i>
<i>It's what you did then.</i>
And that was where he wanted us
to spend the rest of our days.
Happy days.
<i>Well, June...</i>
...your dad, Jack...
...they're scattering his ashes today.
In the sea, off the pier,
at Margate of all places.
Your brother Vince is going.
Uncle Ray. Lenny.
Vic, of course.
Yeah, well...
...let them go, June.
The whole bunch of them.
Let them do it without me
and without you.
The living come first.
Even the living
who were as good as dead to him.
There's no more. Here.
Here you go.
Jack in a box, eh, Vic?
-Do you want to hand him over here, Vic?
-Sorry, Raysy. I was forgetting.
-Do you want to hold him for a bit?
-Yeah.
-Are you quite comfy there, Vic?
-Sure am.
Good, isn't it?
All seats are power adjustable.
Upholstery's all customized.
-Yeah, but Vic ain't a customer, is he?
-Who says?
-How much you asking, Vince?
-What?
Bit of respect, please, Lenny.
Well, it's a nice motor, Vic. I mean, it's a...
...bit heavy on the petrol,
but 65K on the clock and it's genuine....
Just testing.
So when are you going to retire, Vic?
No rush. There's a few customers...
...I shall hang around for yet.
Why do you think my name's Vic?
-Why is your name Vic?
-Well, I'm halfway to a vicar, ain't I?
You could swan it, Vic.
Better than Margate.
-Big Boy here is aiming for the Bahamas.
-Being a grand a throw.
Is that what Jack cost?
Bloody hell, Joan had better start saving.
That's what I heard.
-Very comfy seats these. I could nod off.
-Bloody hell.
Jack.
It's me, Vince.
Jack.
It's me. Jack.
I ain't lost my marbles, Vince.
I know it's you.
I know it's me.
-Want to swap?
-Nah.
Her name's Joy.
I bet she can give you bundles of it and all
by the way she looks.
You fell right on your feet in here,
ain't you, Jack?
-Here. Come here.
-What?
-Sit down.
-Why?
Amy doesn't know what's happening,
does she, Son?
No.
She doesn't know
whether she's coming or going, eh?
She's all right.
She's managing.
Oh, Mum.
Come here, come here.
Come here. Come here.
It's all right. Come here.
She'll manage.
I got the easier part.
It don't seem much of a doddle to me.
People panic.
What do you want
to talk to me about, Jack?
I want you to lend me some cash.
-Cash?
-Yeah, I need some cash, Son.
-You need cash?
-Yeah.
-What, you need cash in here?
-Yeah, in here.
No, no.
I need £1,000.
-£1,000?
-Yeah.
You need £1,000?
Yeah. By Friday, let's say.
And not a dickey-bird.
-Yeah, but--
-Don't ask, Vince.
Don't ask.
It's a request, Son.
Not an order.
-Lend?
-Yeah.
Well....
If Vincey's young Kath can retire, Vic,
I reckon you can, too.
I'll have to think about it.
She didn't retire.
She's still working for you at the garage,
is she?
It's called a showroom, Lenny.
I'm sorry. Showroom.
We all know what's on show, don't we?
Nah, she packed it in, didn't she?
<i>Reckon you lost an asset there, Big Boy.</i>
<i>I mean, I think one of her skirts was worth</i>
<i>six of your ties for bringing the punters in.</i>
What do you say we all stop somewhere
for lunch? Have a break?
Good idea, Vic. Jack would've reckoned
on us having a break for lunch.
Anyway, I hear she ain't out of a job.
-You hungry, Lenny?
-No, I'm thirsty.
What I hear is that she's pulling in punters
of her own now.
Hark who's talking.
I've heard your Sally
is taking in paying lodgers, as it were.
Is that why the two of you ain't talking?
No, the blokes she picks ain't too handy.
They like leaving her in the lurch.
Like the one she's married to, who's in jail.
Thanks to you, Big Boy.
A hot car's a hot car.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
Yes, and her childhood sweetheart
who buggered off to the Army.
<i>Vincey Dodds.</i>
I ain't no Dodds,
and I ain't going to be no butcher's boy.
It's easy for men.
They can go and be soldiers.
-Go off to sea.
-Yeah, sure, Sally.
So, what are you going to be, Vince?
What do you want to be?
Come on, you know, Sal.
-Motors.
-Motors.
Yeah.
See that '59 Mark IX?
It's a start, ain't it?
Ain't any old jam jar, it's a Jag.
And I'll make it like new again.
One of these days
Jack will come crawling to me. You'll see.
Five years. Vincey signed up for five years.
Couldn't wait to get away.
You can't say he ain't following
in your footsteps.
You was a soldier once
as well as a butcher.
I was a butcher by choice.
Soldier? Bleeding defaulter, I'd call him.
A bleeding deserter,
that's what I'd call him.
It's supposed to be "Dodds & Son."
That's what the sign over the shop says.
Wasn't the only reason.
What you think was his reason
wasn't his only reason.
You don't own him, Jack.
-We don't own them, do we?
-Make sense.
We don't own them, do we?
Even when we own them, we don't.
You're talking bollocks.
No, the other reason was our Sally.
He left her a little leaving present.
Sally?
-I'd say she's going to have to get rid of it.
-Vincey got her pregnant?
So, I reckon I'm going to need
one of your winners, Raysy.
Real quick.
Sally?
I thought they'd finish up together,
Vincey and Sally.
They nearly had to, didn't they?
Daughters, who'd have them, Raysy?
I reckon you got the right idea,
you know, Vic.
You get yourself a couple of sons,
put them into the firm...
...and then you can bow out easy.
-Passing on the torch and all that.
-Can't complain.
"Tucker & Sons."
Sounds good, don't it, Vince?
"Tuckers," that's what we're called
and what we do: we tuck them up.
-Don't it, Vince?
-I'm here! I came!
Gents, just remember who's on board.
Okay.
<i>Just like your kindness, Ray...</i>
<i>Just like your kindness, Ray...</i>
...letting me use the yard
to mess around with motors.
Your kindness to an ex-soldier boy.
But I can't expect that to go on indef,
can I?
I ain't ungrateful, Uncle Ray.
So what are you suggesting?
That you pay rent?
What with?
I'm talking ownership.
We're talking buying.
It's the same question twice over.
What with?
I'm asking you to make an investment,
Raysy, in Dodds Motors.
It don't exist yet, but it will in five years.
You don't have to fork out a penny.
You sell me the yard as premises,
you loan me out the asking for five years.
Come five years,
I pay your price plus a percentage.
If I can't stump up, the yard's yours again.
Plain and simple. You can't lose.
Once I've another car on the go...
...and I have the margin,
I'll give you a deposit.
You can keep that and all.
Another one?
Before we go any further...
...there's one thing.
-What's that?
-lt's called a butcher's shop.
Yeah, "Dodds and Son."
He ain't still going on about that, is he?
His old man put that sign up.
I'd want to keep my camper here.
I still need my own space for the camper.
'Course you can. No charge.
I'll even give it a regular once-over for you.
And if you ever want to trade it in,
I'll see you get a good deal.
How could you sell him the yard?
Vince is supposed to be working for me.
What does it say on the shop?
You've seen the sign?
"Next generation. Like father, like son."
Don't you think it's time to forget
about that? He's got his own mind.
You can't kid yourself no more.
Motors ain't just his hobby.
-He's not doing it for the love of it.
-No thanks to Ray.
I'm just returning the favor.
Looking after him like you looked after me.
He should be cutting up meat,
not mucking about with motors.
And in case you haven't noticed,
Vince is your lad, Jack.
Chip off the old block.
Have a drink.
<i>"Dodds & Son."</i>
That's all Jack ever wanted from Vince.
I mean, even if he had to pretend.
Fathers and sons.
What did you want from June?
Just a sign.
Not once in 50 years
did she give me a sign.
Not even a flicker that she knew me,
who I was.
Fifty years. Every week.
-Except for a few weeks, 20 years ago.
-Yeah.
We should've had our fights, June and me.
You know, mothers and daughters.
Where's the luck, Amy?
It's all down to luck.
You hear much from your Susie
in Australia these days, Raysy?
Not really.
I mean,
do you think she'd come if you was....
Do you mean dead, Lenny?
I mean, do you think she'd show up?
-What a question.
-lt's a fair one.
I've never thought about it.
Australia's a long way.
It's not as far
as from here to the next world.
What next world?
It's a manner of speaking, Big Boy.
Sydney is further than Sydenham.
That's very clever.
Raysy, we'll pop in to Sydenham
on the way back.
Slide round the South Circular,
surprise your ex, Carol.
Like we'd be welcome.
You think she'd come?
I mean, if it was your....
Funeral, Lenny. The word's "funeral."
Only to make sure I was dead.
Cup of tea?
-Thanks, Dad.
-Turn that down.
Thanks.
Nice having you back for a few days.
-The trip was great. Andy was great.
-Yeah?
You know he found out where they lived.
-Where who lived?
-Andy's family. Back in the past.
-Before they went to Australia.
-Yeah. Nice for you.
You going down to the Coach?
Yeah. The Coach ain't coming to me, is it?
Yeah.
Are you sure about Australia?
Ain't you got a home here?
And what about college? And teaching?
There's colleges in Australia.
And teachers in Australia.
But you don't know nothing
about Australia.
I'll find out, won't I? Andy will show me.
Yeah, I bet he will.
I could show him the back of my hand.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
There's your fare.
And don't you breathe a word about that.
Fifth at Chepstow. Silver Lord.
Came in by half a length.
Sue....
I know, Dad. I know.
Thank you.
You're the best dad.
And don't you worry, I'll look after Sue.
I tell you, I'm feeling really in tune
now that I've been here to England.
You know, tapped into my roots.
I'm feeling so much more together now
because of...
...everything, you know, because of Sue.
Cheers, Mr. Johnson.
I can't thank you enough.
That was some horse, eh?
Good night, everyone.
Carol, listen.
If she goes, I don't want to see her
ever again. Understand that?
-Carol, you can't stop her. She's 18.
-And I'm not.
Come here.
Come here.
I've got something to show you.
Out in the street.
Rockabilly. Newmarket. 100-to-8.
What is it?
It's a Dormobile.
It's a camper van.
A traveling home for two.
As we're a couple again.
It's a deluxe model.
That's the last straw.
<i>I guess she decided she wanted more</i>
<i>out of life than trips in my little camper.</i>
<i>But the sub-manager</i>
<i>of a bleeding domestic appliance store...</i>
...Barry bleeding Stokes.
Yeah.
She couldn't tell me to my face.
No, it was over the phone.
"Goodbye, Ray."
I never said, "Goodbye, Carol."
Nah.
That was my one cheap comeback.
I didn't say goodbye.
I just hung up and sat there not moving...
...not budging till 6:00 in the morning.
She got me thinking.
I ought to go and see Sue.
You know?
While I'm still.... Before....
Mind you, I haven't spoken to Sue for...
...I can't think how many years.
You can't blame her for that though.
Not really.
That was more me, I think.
I just stopped writing one day.
You know how it is. Things just stop.
Then it seems too long to start them again.
So, what....
What do you think, Amy?
About going to Australia?
Seeing Sue?
It's not too late, is it?
I might have grandchildren.
You never know.
-You ain't said yet, Raysy?
-Said what?
If you think Sue would show up
to see you off.
Yeah, but Australia's a long way.
Well, if not Sue, then who?
I mean, if you had some special,
daft request like Jack here.
-I ain't going to have no daft request.
-But who knows?
There's you.
You want to think twice about that?
Unless you're thinking of,
you know, planning something sooner.
You'll be all right, Raysy. I'll be about.
I reckon they should chuck you
over the straight at Epsom.
What about you, Lenny,
where do you want to be chucked?
I'm with Raysy. I'm not choosy.
It ain't material.
-Ashes is material.
-Yeah, come on, Lenny.
-But what about you, Vic?
-That's all arranged.
What's arranged?
I bought a plot years ago for Pam and me
when plots was cheap.
Camberwell New Cemetery.
-You can go there now, can't you, Raysy?
-Camberwell?
Australia. See Sue. See the grandchildren
you are supposed to have.
-What's stopping you? You're a free man.
-He's right, Raysy.
I mean, travel a little bit, see the world.
Stop off at Bangkok, spend a few quid.
Small matter of the fare, Vic.
Put one of your bets on.
I seem to recall it working before.
Yeah. Should be a nice pub
down here, Vic.
You know,
for that lunch you was talking about.
"It's just the gypsy in my soul
"If I am fancy-free
"Fancy-free"
<i>Doncaster. 15:30. Fancy Free.</i>
<i>33-to-1. Trust me.</i>
I trust you, Luck.
I've got no choice, have I?
-Here.
-Mr. Dodds, what have you done here?
Remember that nurse Kelly
I introduced you to?
-She reckons she fancies you.
-Mr. Dodds.
-Would I lie to you, Lucky?
-Come on, come on.
-'Bye, Luck.
<i>-'Bye, Jack.</i>
-My mate Raysy fancies you.
-Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Got something running in this?
No, as a matter of fact, I haven't.
It's just, you know...
...doesn't seem right, what with....
Must fancy one or two though.
That'd be telling, wouldn't it?
Make the next one a short. Long short.
-ls that all right for you?
-Thank you.
Don't you get too excited, do you hear me?
It's a special favor.
<i>...into the barrier alongside number five,</i>
<i>Fancy Free...</i>

<i>They're under....</i>
-Caning it a bit, ain't we, Raysy?
-Yeah.

<i>Out of the barriers together. An even</i>

<i>Western Ocean close on their heels.</i>
<i>My goodness, Fancy Free hard up</i>

<i>...clips the heels of Rebellion,</i>

Ray?
Jack's....
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
It don't seem right somehow...
...just to leave him here. I mean...
...it don't seem right for us to go
and just leave him here on his own.
Alone while we have lunch.
It's up to you, Vince.
No, you're right, Ray.
He should come with us, shouldn't he?
Coffee. My Mandy said
she needed some coffee.
Mandy doesn't know what a lucky girl
she is, having such a good husband.
Mandy knows she's a lucky girl.
That's Rochester Castle, yeah.
Here you are, you take care of Jack, Raysy.
Three pints of best, please,
gorgeous, and....
Want a drop of scotch, Vic?
And a drop of scotch for him, please.
Any grub on the go, babe?
-lt's a crying shame that Jack ain't here.
-Yeah, he'd have appreciated it.
-He shouldn't have rushed off like he did.
-No, daft of him. Still, it's a crying shame.
If he was here, we wouldn't be, would we?
It's because he's not that we are.
-Yeah, all the same.
-Yeah.
He'd have appreciated it.
And it's because of him that we're here.
I mean, we wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for him.
I'm going to take a leak.
<i>-Thanks, darling.</i>
<i>-All right, love.</i>
<i>This is Lucky and my fiancée Carol.</i>
<i>This is Lucky and my fiancée Carol.</i>
My wife Amy.
-Pam.
-Vic.
Lenny. My wife.
-Joan.
-Nice to meet you.
If it wasn't for Lucky here,
I wouldn't be here, would l, Lucky?
We call him Lucky, but his real name's....
Ray. Ray Johnson.
Jack Dodds.
Small fellows have the advantage.
Small fellows have the luck.
I hope you understand that.
Less of a target for the enemy.
Less weight to carry around
in this fucking frying pan. Mind you...
...doesn't take away from my advantage.
'Cause I could knock your block off
anytime I like.
I hope you understand that.
Hello, Ray.
Hello, Lucky.
How did you get to be so small, anyway?
-Did someone shrink you in the wash?
-Yeah, funny.
Who'd have believed it?
I meet Ray in Egypt,
and he comes from 'round the corner.
You never!
-You know Valetta Street?
-Yeah.
You know the scrap merchants,
Frank Johnson's?
-Yeah.
-My dad.
-You know Dodds butcher's shop, Spring Road?
-Of course.
Bet your ma buys her meat there, eh?
Best bangers in Bermondsey.
Jack, get down!
I owe him my life. Don't l, Lucky?
Jack, get down!
Oh, Jesus, Lucky...
...if you hadn't have pulled me down...
...l'd have copped that smack
in the wife's best friend.
So the wife must be thankful?
I am, Ray.
I am.
Least I could do.
Least he could do.
Save my bollocks for me.
Excuse my friend, won't you, Carol?
What are the odds?
Lucky here is the one to ask about that.
He's got a head for figures.
You shouldn't be going into insurance, Ray.
You should've been a jockey.
Too big for a jockey. Otherwise....
So I've heard, Ray. So I've heard.
Oh, yeah?
To Jack.
Jack.
Can we have the same again?
Not for me, Raysy. Unless you want
to find yourself another driver.
I'll have a nice cup of coffee, darling.
And half a Corona.
Oh, yeah, and I'll have a large cognac.
Just as well Amy didn't come.
She wouldn't have planned on a piss-up.
Is that tea or whisky you're drinking there?
Tea.
He wouldn't begrudge us, would he?
It's a long way to Margate.
<i>I thought:</i>
<i>"You ain't been nowhere,</i>
<i>and you ain't going nowhere."</i>
Yeah, I saw his glove
where his face had been.
And I saw stars.
I actually saw them like they say you do.
Isn't it time to pack it in then?
Hang up the gloves.
I could've won 50 smackers.
You're seven years older
than when you last fought.
Yeah, well.
Gunner Tate,
middleweight, always pissed....
"Always pissed and always late."
-I was wondering, Vince....
-What was you wondering, Vic?
-I was wondering, Vince....
-What was you wondering, Vic?
I was wondering if we could pop over
to Chatham. See the war memorial.
Yeah, I don't see why not. Do you, Raysy?
I'd have thought a man
in your line of business...
...would've had enough of memorials.
Nah, that's why we're here, ain't it?
To remember the dead.
Yeah. That's what we're doing, Vince.
-Mean a detour?
-We can do detours.
It's my round, ain't it? Same again, chaps?
Vince, want another coffee?
Something to go with it?
I don't know about you, Lenny...
...but I'm driving down to Margate
to deliver something.
That's why we're all here.
Vic here wants a little stop on the way,
which I ain't against.
Considering we're here
to remember the dead.
It's just gone 14:15.
If you want to sit here all day drinking...
...that's your business.
I'm going to the car, then to Margate.
So if you ain't coming,
you'd better find a station.
Tosshead.
My old dad used to say,
"You don't dilly-dally with the deceased."
Shit.
Hey!
Big Boy!
You forgot something, didn't you?
You forgot something.
You forgot this, didn't you?
You forgot your coffee.
You may think you can do without us...
...but you'd look a bloody fool
going to Margate without this.
-He didn't say it was up no bleeding hill.
-Nah.
Hold up, Vic.
Come on then!
The old buggers.
Exalted company, Vince.
<i>They used to think I was bad luck at first.</i>
Kept well away.
It weren't long before they realized
how much I was needed.
<i>How important what I did was.</i>
Helped me realize it, too.
Accept it.
Something to be proud of really.
Pam.
Vic.
So what do you do then, Vic,
when you're not mucking about in boats?
Ships, not boats.
I'm in the undertaking trade.
Family business.
Well, I never would have guessed, Vic.
You'll never be out of a job then, will you?
So you'll be used to handling bodies then.
-You got yourself a winner here, Vic.
-Yeah, spoils of war.
She's a lively one.
-Bleeding hill nearly finished me.
-That's it, I'm packing up smoking.
"Heligoland," where the hell's that?
"Jutland, Doggerbank."
Fucking Navy.
Fucking Army.
Get down!
Fucking tourists.
<i>I fancy seeing the pyramids.</i>
I fancy seeing the inside
of the nearest knocking shop.
Pyramids are tombs, ain't they, Lucky?
Pyramids are for dead people.
Whereas, a tart's tackle....
A mate gave me that.
Personal recommendation.
-Maybe I could just stay here and--
-lt's "Be-kind-to-your-pecker" Day.
-Yeah, maybe it's best if l--
-What's up?
-Not so long since you seen the missus?
-I don't have no missus.
Well, so, then?
I have.
Different place, different rules, eh, Ray?
Lucky man.
No, that's you, remember?
<i>Please, come, come.</i>
Please, look at it. Look at the girls.
Take your pick.
Your first choice, Raysy.
Just don't pick the one
with the big bristols on the right.
They're laughing, Jack.
What do you want them to do, cry?
Good choice, Lucky. Your size.
Take your pick. Come on, take your pick.
No. No.
Oh, no. Jesus.
Oh, blimey.
You lick me.
"Lick"?
Oh, like. Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.
-You've got ten minutes.
Look at clock.
What your friend think you go now?
Oh, right. Yeah.
Ray.
Ray Johnson.
Ray.
How was it?
Madame Yashmak here was just about
to come and prise you two apart.
Very good. Very good.
Little man, big "cuck."
"Cuck"?
-Go on then.
-You sure about this, Raysy?
It's all right. I used to drive
the old man's horse and cart.
But this ain't a horse and cart.
It's a camel.
Trust me.
I trust you, Raysy. I ain't got no choice.
Second ride of the day, Raysy!
I'll catch you up.
You go on, I'll catch you up there.
Go on.
What's all that about?
Vincey.
Let's go, lad.
Come on, Vincey.
If a butcher can get cost
on what he chucks in his wastage bin...
...and in his fat drawer,
he'd be happy, wouldn't he?
He'd be laughing.
What you must understand is that...
...what comes into the shop
ain't what goes out of the shop.
-ls fat wastage?
-Exactly.
If you take away the weight of the wastage
from what you buy...
...and you divide what's left
into what you paid for it...
...that'll give you your real cost...
...which is set against your takings.
Don't forget that...
...because bone will cost you,
fat and shrinkage will cost you...
...and not keeping your knife sharp
will cost you.
You'll end up with measly scraps of meat
that ain't fit to sell to no one.
And that'll cost you more than anything.
You got to keep a constant eye
on wastage. Constant.
-lt's all about waste.
-Yeah.
You're a good boy, Vincey.
Good boy.
Vincey.
Uncle Ray!
This is Uncle Ray's favorite breakfast spot.
Because he likes hanging 'round real men.
My secret's out.
And he also fancies the likes of that.
It's a love from afar, eh, Lucky?
-What are you looking at, you little rascal?
-Stop him.
I don't know what you want to be doing
with all this in here.
You're a good boy, Vince.
What are you doing there?
Keys.
Sorry.
-Raysy.
-What?
I was wondering.
-Wondering?
-Yeah.
Jack never said nothing to you
about no money, did he?
When he was.... Before....
He didn't say nothing
about no sum of money?
-What sum of money?
-No, it don't matter.
Say about £1,000.
No, he never mentioned no money.
Only we got to see Amy right, ain't we?
Yes.
-We got to see Amy right.
-Of course.
Detour.
Raysy, where's Jack?
Jesus, what now?
Search me.
<i>Wicks' Farm.</i>
That's where we first met, Jack and me.
We weren't much more than kids
scratching for a few shillings.
<i>Whatever we could get.</i>
Like picking flowers.
"He loves me. He loves me not.
"He loves me. He loves me not."
So what did you come for?
Need the shillings. Same as everyone.
So what do you do
when you're not picking hops?
Well, that would be telling now,
wouldn't it?
Picking up girls is what I remember.
It was our holiday, weren't it?
Well, near as we could get.
Felt like it.
Well, something different, weren't it?
Yeah.
Music and singing every night.
Uncles, aunts, cousins....
Pickers from every which where.
And the gypsies.
The gypsies.
You can put the spuds on here now.
Cheryl...
...quickly, can you go and see
if you can find the children?
I got these from one of Wicks' hands.
You want them?
Yeah.
If you want to help me top and tail
and string them.
Yeah, all right.
-There's a chair in here if you want it.
-No, I'll be all right on the grass.
Chuck them in here.
See if we can't fill it.
Jack.
Mummy.
You're beautiful.
Do you know that?
You are beautiful.
It's not what you expect
from a butcher's boy.
And to know from his smile
that he means it.
It turns you over.
Yeah.
Well, wait here then.
You can take me for a walk.
And that was our June.
This ain't Margate.
It ain't what Jack wanted.
What's he doing?
You toerag!
Last orders have to be respected.
Pillock!
No respect for Jack's wishes ever.
I mean, he doesn't have any prior claim,
does he?
I mean, he has no special rights.
He's not kin, is he? He never was.
Tosshead!
You fucking toerag. Give me that.
What are you doing? Get off!
Always what Vincey wants, eh?
Some son you were, Big Boy.
Some son.
There was no love lost, was there?
Lenny...
...what are you doing?
Come on.
Too good for your old man?
Too good for all of us?
That's for Sally.
And that's for Jack.
Yeah, you....
Lenny.
Come on, Lenny. Come on.
Fists. Come on, tosser.
Fists, you pillock.
Fists?
Calm down, Lenny. Calm down.
Just stop, Lenny.
Come on. Got you, got you.
-Let me back at him.
-Leave it, Lenny, leave it!
I wasn't going to throw it all.
I was only going to throw a bit.
It was only a bit.
What are we going to do then?
Was you going to stop every 10 minutes
so you can chuck a bit?
You know, handful here, handful there.
What does scatter mean?
What does the word "scatter" mean?
What does it fucking mean?
Should be ashamed of yourself.
You pillock.
This is where....
This is where....
<i>See down there?</i>
That's where me and your mum first met.
Hop picking.
That's where me and your mum first met.
Hop picking.
What's hop picking?
It's what me and your mum did.
What we used to do down there.
They say Kent is the garden of England.
But it's like you've got to have the country
to have the town.
See them orchards?
Uncle Lenny couldn't have
no apples to sell, could he?
See them sheep?
Come with me.
You see...
...with hops, it's not the hops
or how you pick them, it's...
...who picks them.
What I'm meaning to say is...
...it wasn't your mum or me
who picked your hops.
We picked someone else's hops.
Her name's June.
She's your sister.
You have a sister called June.
I ain't got a sister.
-I ain't got a sister.
-Your sister's a loony!
-Ain't got a sister. Ain't got a sister.
-Sister's a loony! Sister's a loony!
Where is she? In a nuthouse?
No, she's in a home.
But, well...
...actually, she's not really your sister...
...she's sort of your sister.
Because, you see...
...during the war,
the Jerries sent over these things...
<i>...and when they ran out of fuel...</i>
...they came down on the house.
They was called doodlebugs.
"Doodlebug"?
<i>Yeah. A flying bomb.</i>
<i>A B1...</i>
<i>...and it flattened the Pritchett's house.</i>
Killed them all except you.
It's a baby!
Is it alive still?
Amy rescued you. Otherwise....
-Will you take it then?
-Yeah.
Thanks, love. Right, got it?
<i>You were born a Pritchett.</i>
Vincent lan Pritchett.
I came home from the war
and there you were.
The son I never knew I had.
So you're not really my dad?
I've got a cloth in the car, Lenny.
And a brush.
Here, hold Jack, Raysy.
Now, we need the Canterbury road.
Look for signs for Canterbury.
-A28.
-Yeah.
Canterbury?
We might as well call in there as well.
Pop in to the bleeding cathedral.
No, you're right, Lenny.
Why shouldn't we take him
'round Canterbury Cathedral?
Jack'd have loved that, wouldn't he?
Yeah, good idea, Lenny. Nice gesture.
He'd be honored.
I've never been to Canterbury Cathedral.
Not, you know, inside.
Nah.
Canterbury doesn't have a racecourse,
does it?
Fourteen centuries.
I mean, I have a think about that,
14 centuries.
They got kings and queens in here.
Makes me feel humble. My line of work.
Yeah.
Got saints and cardinals.
That's where Becket got done.
Up there on them steps.
"...full-length view
from behind Saint Augustine's chair...
"...from the thirteenth century, and a copy
of Augustine's original Saxon cathedral...
"...of sins completed behind the transepts
by William the Englishman."
Well, this is lovely, isn't it?
-You all right, Lucky?
-Yeah, give me a mo.
What, was I rabbiting on, was I?
No, it's not that.
Here, take Jack for a bit. I'll catch you up.
-All right. Sit there and take it easy.
-Yeah.
Come on. I think the Black Prince
is here somewhere.
Whatever you say, Big Boy.
<i>I mean, there's only me to consider now,</i>
<i>ain't there?</i>
Yeah, now all your women have run off
to places named "Syd" something or other.
Well, with them gone,
I don't need it, do I? So...
...when Henderson offered me
the promotion, I told him:
"I don't need a leg up, thanks.
"I'd prefer two days less work
for a quarter less wages."
-Are you having a cup of tea or not?
-Yeah.
It's all right for some.
Some of us have to make an honest living.
All right, darling?
So...
...l'll have many a free Thursday.
If ever you want me to drive you.
To see June.
Well, that's a long old bus ride
you have to do.
The Horses can do without me for a day.
And besides, it's right near Epsom.
And maybe I could come in.
And see June.
Yeah, all right, Ray.
Here you are, hold Jack.
"Fought at Cressi...."
He sounds like a proper soldier boy.
"Married to Joan, the Fair Maid of Kent."
Here, Lenny, look,
someone else got spliced to a Joan.
Doesn't look like he smiled much, does it?
"Fought at Cressi...
"...and Poitiers...."
Good afternoon, Vic Tucker,
funeral director...
...for the late Mr. Adams.
Oh, yes, Mr. Tucker.
One moment.
Do you have a June Dodds here
by any chance?
Been with us almost 30 years.
Down there...
...out the door, third door on the left.
Thank you.
Right. I say we take a quick gander
at the cloisters and make a move.
-Eh, Lenny?
-All right, Big Boy. Lead on.
<i>"If I am fancy-free</i>
"And love to wander
"And love to wander
"It's just the gypsy in my soul"
I met you the same time as I met Jack.
Did you know that?
-What, in the desert?
-Yeah, in the desert. Egypt.
I saw your photo.
<i>I knew the first time we actually met.</i>
In the stationary Coach and Horses?
-I could tell.
-Yeah?
Just by the way you looked at me.
We're not going to see June today, Amy.
I've packed a picnic in the back.
Whatever you say, Ray.
<i>And it's Blackbird leading....</i>
Can't see which one's ahead.
Oh, I can't see.
Come on, Malfi. Come on, Malfi!
Come on!
Oh, my God!
Come on, Malfi!
Come on! Go on, Malfi!
-Come on!
-Oh, my God, I don't believe it!
She's won!
Ray!
We won!
Come on, picnic time.
-When do we get the money?
-Honest Harry's over there.
That was so exciting.
I've never won anything before, Ray.
Oh, my God.
Come on, get in the van. Quick.
Come on, in you go.
You took me places.
I loved traveling about.
Our picnics.
It's just like home, isn't it?
Home from home.
Ray, you're such a lovely man.
You're a lucky man.
You're a little ray of sunshine.
You're a little ray of hope.
Here.
<i>I still cherish those weeks, Ray.</i>
Six, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Was a pity they had to stop, wasn't it?
-Well, I couldn't not see June, could I?
-No.
Then with Vincey coming home
from the Army and....
Yeah. It meant a lot to you,
Vincey coming home.
And seeing June.
And we couldn't do it to Jack.
Could we?
He loved me, Ray.
No one else for him, I swear it.
-So, how was it?
-All right.
<i>Couldn't love June...</i>
<i>...but he did love me.</i>
You're beautiful, Amy.
Still beautiful.
Vince is bloody 40,
and you're still beautiful.
What do you say I take you dancing?
-Dancing?
-Yeah, I want to be the envy of one and all.
Good luck.
We haven't been dancing in a long while,
have we?
Well, I don't have enough fingers
and toes to count the years.
Thirty years.
-Oh, Jack.
-Come here. Come here.
You all right?
Butchery Lane?
Now that's got to be worth a look,
don't it?
Be bloody rude not to.
There you are. Thought we'd lost you.
I think a pint wouldn't hurt, would it?
<i>Yeah, he's a lovely man, your Uncle Ray.</i>
Little ray of sunshine.
Did you miss me, June?
Did you even know I weren't here
for those six weeks that summer?
Out of how many in 50 years?
If you tot up the hours
we've actually spent together...
...probably only been about a year.
It's not much
for mother and daughter, is it?
Maybe he was right, Jack.
Your dad.
I did choose you.
He couldn't choose you.
He couldn't choose his own.
Not even at the end, did he want to know,
"How's June?"
<i>Not even, "Send June my love."</i>
<i>You would have loved him though, June.</i>
<i>You would have loved him.</i>
Still beautiful, Amy.
Still.
<i>Journey's end.</i>
Hallelujah. Gasping for a pee.
This is Marine Terrace.
Marine Terrace, Margate. The Golden Mile.
'Course it's out of season.
Dreamland's still there.
Where's the pier?
You're looking at it, Raysy.
-What, that thing? Well, that ain't a pier.
-Yeah, but they call it the "Pier."
-No, that's a harbor wall.
-Yeah, but they call it the "Pier."
There used to be the jetty
that looked like a pier.
Where the steamboats came in.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
Well, it sounds reasonable.
So where's the other thing, the jetty?
Well, that got swept away in about....
The storms, 1970, something, yeah.
Yeah.
I remember Amy saying,
"Did you hear about Margate Jetty?"
Yeah.
-Not good scattering weather.
-Well, that depends how you look at it.
-Fair old wind.
-Yeah.
Vic, we don't need the bag now.
Here, you hold him, Ray.
Well, where's Lenny?
Has he gone for a paddle and all?
Oh, God, look at him.
He ain't even done his trousers up.
All right?
Come on.
He's off.
Come on, you soppy sod.
It ain't weather for the beach, I tell you.
Mad Gunner Tate.
Mad Jack Dodds. You think he whisked
this up special, do you?
-Well.
-Well.
<i>Well, June...</i>
...they must be there by now.
...they must be there by now.
Margate.
Jack in the sea.
Or about to be.
Goodbye, Jack.
Goodbye, June.
Oh, June.
We've got to make our own lives now,
June...
...without each other.
We've got to go our own separate ways.
I've got to think of my own future.
Now 50 years is beyond the call
for bringing up baby.
Most I've ever wanted,
the most I've ever hoped for...
...in those 50 years,
I haven't asked for the earth, believe me...
...is that you should've looked at me
just once and said:
"Mom."
I couldn't have just stopped coming
without saying this to your face.
Goodbye, June.
<i>If there was anything other than...</i>
...blind chance in the world...
...if we could see
and choose in the first place...
...you'd be riding Derby winners...
...Lenny'd be the middleweight champion
and I'd be Doctor Kildare.
And Vic?
Well, I reckon Vic's where he wants to be.
I reckon Vic's got it sorted out.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
If you ever get the chance...
...Raysy. If you ever get the option...
...you go first.
It's the carrying on that's hard.
Ending...
...it ain't nothing.
That ain't an option I've got, is it?
I mean, if anyone has.
Seeing as it's just me.
You never know.
Still, I reckon I'm lucky.
Nah. I'm Lucky.
It'll be harder for Amy.
Yeah.
She'll need looking after, Raysy.
Yeah.
We've got to see Amy right.
It's all a gamble, isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
Just a gamble.
<i>It's going to be all right, Amy.</i>
Jack's made sure
you're going to be all right.
That 20 grand. There's no problem.
There's nothing hanging over you.
You can have that bungalow in Margate
if you wanted it.
Or.... Maybe...
...you might go on a little trip down under.
Think you'd fancy that, down under?
Australia's a long way, Ray.
Oh, yeah.
But then I do like traveling about.
Well....
Come here.
-Here, Vince. Come here.
-What?
About your £1,000.
I've got it.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
I'll explain when we get home.
Yeah.
See Amy all right, too.
Yeah.
I think Amy made the right decision
after all, don't you?
Yeah.
God help us.
-Not far.
-Nearly there now, Jack.
Here we are.
Over here.
Not too near the edge.
The wind will take him.
Let the wind take him.
Here, keep your hands as dry as you can.
Right. Come on then.
Go on, Vince. Come on.
Goodbye, Jack.
Yeah.
'Bye, Jack.
'Bye, Jack.
-'Bye, Jack.
-'Bye, Dad.
Bye-bye, Jack.
Go on, Ray.
Goodbye, Jack.
'Bye, Jack.
Ta-ta, mate.
Dry work, eh, lads?
Yeah, a pint wouldn't be out of place,
would it?
Jack'd expect nothing less.
Here.
Drinks are on me.
If that's all right with you, Lenny.
Well done, Vic.
If you're shouting, Big Boy, I'm there.
Till the last bell rings.
Be my pleasure, Gunner.
Jack would expect nothing less.
Yeah.
