GUARD: Hey, hold ii!
Go. Go down that hall. Go. Go there.
Go. go!
Don't move. Hands in the air.
[TRAIN APPROACHES]
Hey!
<i>Hi, my name is Brian Finch and the first
thing you should know about me</i>
<i>is I didn't do anything wrong.</i>
<i>Well, not the kind o! wrong that leads
to having a gun in your lace anyway.</i>
<i>H! explain.
There were a few mistakes along the way.</i>
<i>Five expulsions, four misdemeanors,
three fake IDs,</i>
<i>two attempts at the 11th grade
and a partridge in a pear tree.</i>
<i>I always thought
I'd find something different,</i>
<i>something, I don't know, great?</i>
<i>Something like this.</i>
<i>♪ >a' Ain't no easy way out...</i>
<i>I loved it.</i>
<i>When my dad asked me
what I planned to do with myself,</i>
<i>I actually had something to say.</i>
Then time passes,
everyone around you starts to grow up,
<i>and when your break is slow to come,
people fall away.</i>
<i>Eli, the guy t started the band with,
he was the first to quit.</i>
It starts to !eel <i>like</i> no one told you
<i>you were playing a game
of musical chairs.</i>
<i>Get a job, get married, get a life.
What are you waiting for'?</i>
<i>The song is gonna stop playing
any second now.</i>
<i>♪ Ooh, I gotta get away</i>
<i>♪ >a' Ain't no easy way out a'</i>
<i>BRIAN: So that's the thing.
I wouldn't really call it a band per se.</i>
It's a project and it has its own name,
but I'm the only one involved.
So we're self-releasing...
So when you say
you're the only one involved,
when you say we, you mean...
- I mean me.
- Mm-hm.
Me is we. Or is it the other way around?
We is me, me is we?
Anyway, it's called Resorbed Twin.
And the album goes on Bandcamp
next week.
That's great. Right? That's great!
So, Brian, can I hear it?
Uh... it's embargoed right now.
But I'll let you know right away.
- Good.
- MOM: Who wants dessert?
- ALL: Yes.
- MOM: Yes? All round? Super.
- ALL: Dad?
- Dennis?
Dennis? Dennis?
You OK? Take him to the sofa.
<i>BRIAN: That was the first time
my dad collapsed. There were more.</i>
<i>Three in the next two months</i>
<i>and still nobody could figure out
what was wrong with him.</i>
Hey, Dad. Hey.
- Hey, Brian.
- Sorry I'm late.
I ended up playing
till two in the morning last night.
And Jason from the club forgot
to pay me. I need to go back today.
You know what? Never mind.
How are you? How was the scan?
- Did you hear anything?
- No.
Maybe they'll find something
this time, hm?
I was thinking that maybe I should come
out to the house for a little while.
You know? Just till they figure
this whole thing out.
Wait a minute.
You wanna move back home?
Ye... Not cos I need to, Dad.
I don't know. I don't know.
I got your mom.
I'm getting around OK.
- What would you do?
- What do you mean?
What are you offering, Brian?
How would you help? Tell me.
<i>BRIAN: He wasn't trying to be mean.
That's not my dad.</i>
<i>But he was saying a lot more
than he meant to.</i>
<i>Help? I could barely
take care of myself.</i>
<i>Other people had careers.
Me? I was a temp.</i>
Manchester-Reid Bancorp is the eighth
or ninth biggest bank on Wall Street,
depending on how you measure.
Everyone who works here
just took a sexual harassment seminar,
it's a liability thing,
and then they signed a form
acknowledging that they went, so...
These are the signed forms.
Those are our employee files.
Your job is to put each form
into the proper file.
We have 22,000 employees.
We figure it'll take you two weeks.
- [PHONE RINGS]
- Jessamyn Eubanks.
I didn't break up with Teddy.
I just didn't take the ring.
It doesn't mean we broke up.
No, it doesn't.
[SNORES]
MAN: Brian.
Brian.
Yep, um...
[CLEARS THROAT]
Eli?
What are you, uh...
What are you doing here?
Couple of guys out on the floor
told me the temp was snoring back here.
I can't believe it's you.
- You're an investment banker.
- Yeah.
Well, I mean, I wouldn't call it a band
per se. Um... It's a project.
But I'm the only one involved.
Man, I'm so glad you're still
making music. That's awesome.
Do you have the record on your phone?
Let's listen to it right now.
Eli... there's no album.
I haven't written a song in like...
God, over a year.
Why not?
[SIGHS] I don't know, man.
I just... I can't concentrate.
My dad's sick.
- What's wrong with him?
- They're not sure.
If he doesn't get better...
I mean, my dad might die.
What has he seen me accomplish?
You know, I might be able to help.
- You carry around a money clip now?
- Yeah.
I got the biggest bonus in the bank
last quarter and they gave me this.
- Yeah.
- It's got my initials.
- That's awesome.
- Yeah, I know.
20-year-old me would punch
28-year-old me in the face.
- Here.
- OK...
Take it. It'll give you like,
I don't know, a jump start
- What is that? Some kind of speed?
- No.
- That's not where I'm...
- Hey, you heard of modafinil?
- Mm-hm.
- Neuroenhancers?
Well, it's like that. Just better.
A lot better.
[SIGHS] I don't think that...
Brian... I don't think you understand
what I'm offering you here.
<i>BRIAN: A jump start.</i>
<i>OK. What did I have to</i> lose?
<i>Here we go.</i>
JESSAMYN: Yeah, I filled out
his business school applications.
Yep, essays too.
BRIAN: Wow, awesome joke, <i>Eli.</i>
JESSAMYN: He's smart, Mom, he is.
He's just, you know, he's Teddy.
OK? And I don't think that we should
be getting engaged right now...
<i>BRIAN: Then it happened.</i>
The scales <i>!ell</i> from my eyes.
<i>Your brain is a miracle,
but it's not efficient.</i>
There's a maze inside everyone's head,
a labyrinth o! missed connections
and untapped potential.
I filled out
his business school applications.
- Because he wasn't gonna do it.
- But now suddenly <i>I</i> had access...
- <i>Cos he's</i> Teddy.
- ...to <i>every single brain cell.</i>
That guy looks familiar, doesn't he?
Who are you?
You know who he is. You remember
a lot more than you think you do.
<i>Every</i> experience you've ever had,
every idea
that came to you in the shower
and then slipped away
while you were brushing your teeth,
it's all there for the taking.
The bank wants to know
who's leaving them open to a lawsuit.
They should probably know about the guy
whose frat got kicked off campus
for selling a date-rape drug.
This guy's had five female assistants
in a year. What's the story there?
BRIAN: Two weeks.
She told me <i>it</i> would take two weeks.
<i>I guess I got carried away,
cos I was done in two hours.</i>
So, yeah, <i>I</i> read every file <i>in</i> here.
<i>Then I sorted them into five tiers of
potential risk. it's pretty intuitive.</i>
Tier one is color-coded green.
They're your safest employees.
Tier five, the reds,
is reserved for total undesirables.
This is incredible.
One more thing. Break up with Teddy.
You deserve better.
But you know that.
That's why you turned down the ring.
- We've been together so long.
- It's scary, I know.
But you'll be fine.
You're about to get a promotion.
This filing system,
you're taking credit for it.
You get a bump to vice president,
spend six months there.
Then the bank'll pay for you
to go to business school.
How did you know
I was thinking about an MBA?
You filled out the applications
for your ex.
I didn't talk to Teddy yet.
You're <i>as</i> smart <i>as</i> anyone
who works here.
How could you not think about an MBA?
You know what else?
They've got no women on the board.
They've never had one.
That's gotta change.
You could run this place, Jessamyn.
- I'm not a CEO.
- Yeah, but you can be.
You can have the job you want. You can
have a guy that understands you.
You deserve it.
All you gotta do is know how to ask.
Kind of seems like you understand me.
Of course I do. I read your file.
<i>BRIAN: I remember this feeling.
The world is mine.</i>
<i>I just have to decide
what to do with it.</i>
Hey! Do you mind if I play?
It'll just take a second.
My dad gave me a lesson or two
when <i>I</i> was a kid,
<i>but, to be completely honest with you,
it never really clicked until...</i>
Now.
Re-brand.
You don't sell hot dogs anymore.
You sell artisanal hot dogs.
That's the next thing.
<i>Cupcakes are on the way out.</i>
The mavens never embraced pie,
so that's not happening.
Did you read The Tipping Point?
You know about mavens?
I'm telling you, Cecil,
if you build it, they will come.
Checkmate.
Checkmate.
Checkmate.
We should play for money.
I dabble.
Dad, watch this.
MAN: Nice.
My brother's medical school textbooks
were <i>still</i> at my parents' place.
<i>Nobody else could figure out
what was wrong with my father.</i>
<i>Why can't I?</i>
<i>Suddenly I knew
exactly what I was looking for.</i>
<i>This. A picture of my grandparents
on their honeymoon.</i>
<i>Her eyes, they're the same as Dad's.</i>
<i>It runs in the family.</i>
<i>Ever been hungover'!
Yeah, this was like that, just worse.</i>
<i>A</i> lot worse.
- Oh, Brian, you look awful.
- Good morning.
Dad...
I think you've got something
called, um... hemochromatosis.
It's caused by a trait
that runs in our family.
Grandma Helen had it, your cousin Scott.
You've got it the worst
out of anybody, though,
and, um, it's cos your body
can't process iron...
All right, stop. Just stop.
You spend one night on the floor
and suddenly you're a doctor?
Dad, listen to me for a second, OK?
The inherited version of hemochromatosis
is one of the most misdiagnosed
diseases that there is.
Doctors mistake it for...
dozens of other things.
And if they can't find it,
how could you?
It's a long story,
but there is a test that they can run
called a, uh,
transferrin saturation test,
and, um...
...I think you guys
should take that... today.
[PHONE RINGS]
You have one new message.
MOM: <i>Brian, I don't know how you knew,
but you were right,</i>
<i>your father has hemochromatosis.</i>
<i>But with your dad, the doctor said
it's concentrated in his liver</i>
<i>and they say he needs a transplant.</i>
<i>But they say they're not sure
he'll get an organ in time.</i>
<i>Call me.</i>
<i>BRIAN: So, in the end,
that pill got me past one problem</i>
<i>I</i> could never solve on my own
<i>and dumped me
right in front of another one.</i>
<i>Find a liver'! How do you even do that?</i>
<i>I needed another pill.</i>
Hello?
Eli?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my... Oh.
<i>I gotta cal! the police. Wait.</i>
<i>If Fm gonna help my dad,
I better find those pills.</i>
Oh, God.
<i>The money clip was gone,
the place was trashed,</i>
<i>but whoever tore ll apart
obviously didn't know Ell as well as me.</i>
<i>He always kept a backup stash
taped to the inside of his acoustic.</i>
MAN: Open up! Open up!
We need to talk to you!
Whatever's coming through that door,
<i>I'm pretty sure Brian Finch
is not qualified to handle it,</i>
<i>not without help.</i>
AGENT: Clear!
<i>Eli's phone, that could come in handy.</i>
<i>It doesn't look like
there's a fast way out here.</i>
<i>But what if suddenly you knew
how much strength you had in your hands?</i>
<i>I mean exactly how much,</i>
<i>down to the moment
the last muscle fiber would give.</i>
Hey! FBI!
[HORNS BLARE]
<i>Three paths, three potential outcomes.</i>
<i>It's tempting to head into the park
until you remember</i>
<i>the mayor just doubled the foot patrols
in Union Square.</i>
<i>I could try one more mad dash
across the street.</i>
<i>But let's not push that.</i>
<i>Subway it is.</i>
Don't move. Hands in the air.
Hey!
<i>Dumb idea? Sure.</i>
<i>But what if you could remember
every documentary you ever saw?</i>
<i>Every trig class? Could you do the math?</i>
<i>Could you figure out exactly
where that train is going to stop?</i>
<i>If you're positive
that the driver could see you,</i>
<i>I think you could get pretty close.</i>
<i>90% sure.</i>
Maybe 80%.
<i>And if you could remember
that there's an abandoned track</i>
<i>next to the L stop in Union Square,</i>
<i>then the dumbest stunt you ever put!</i>
<i>might just tum out to be
the smartest moment of your life.</i>
<i>REBECCA: His name's Brian Finch.</i>
<i>We ran stills from the subway
through facial recognition software.</i>
<i>He profiles as basically no one</i>
and yet he got away
from six of our agents.
I saw him jump in front of the L train
and bring it to a dead stop
like he was playing chicken.
- You're making a point?
- He knew the train was gonna stop.
Why did you ask us to bring
Eli Whitford in for questioning?
What did you expect to find
in his apartment?
There's an explanation
for what you saw today.
<i>REPORTER:
Finch is the leading suspect...</i>
<i>FBI</i> BOSS: <i>In 2011, the DEA picked up a dealer</i>
<i>selling a nootropic compound
he called NZT-48.</i>
We don't know where it came from,
but it affects multiple regions of the brain.
The cognitive enhancements
were like nothing you've ever seen.
We recorded stuff in the lab
that would make you rethink
the whole idea of the impossible.
- The lab?
- You're a resourceful woman, Rebecca.
I'm sure you can imagine
multiple applications for NZT.
Everyone in the study was either
from Central Intelligence or the Bureau.
They all volunteered.
We reverse-engineered the compound.
The pictures on the right
were taken a year into the study.
My God.
The program was called off
after the first two fatalities.
They just... closed up shop?
We don't know how Brian Finch
is connected to NZT.
<i>But there are some important eyes
looking at this.</i>
<i>You'll have all the resources you need.
Find him.</i>
Is it me,
or did the whole world just change?
We can't think about it that way.
It's a fugitive case. Let's work it.
I'll go see Finch's parents.
Get the word out to other agencies.
Yeah. Hey.
On that subway platform, you had
your gun on him, the shot was clean.
Why didn't you take it?
Crowd spooked me.
A lot of ricochet in a concrete tunnel.
You have to take care of this yourself.
They think you killed Eli.
But you know that.
That's why you took Eli's phone.
Once you turn it on, the GPS will ping
to a tower in about 40 seconds,
so work fast.
[OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS]
MAN: <i>Eli, my connect's out o! pills.
Honey can'! find any either.</i>
<i>We gotta dig deep.
Have to stay ahead of the pack at M-R.</i>
M-R. That's Manchester-Reid.
There are two other people
at the bank using NZT.
<i>Eli's income went up by a factor of ten
when he was taking those pills.</i>
<i>So did this guy's, Jay Winston,
and this guy's, Adam Honeycutt.</i>
Adam Honeycutt. Jay Winston.
Those are the other people using NZT.
Winston has listed a hotel in SoHo
as his address.
He's living out of a suite. It's about
two miles from here. Go there first.
Brian? You're sure you mean our son?
The safest option for your son
is to surrender.
If he calls, please tell him that.
I'm... I'm sorry, I don't understand.
He was friends with Eli.
Brian wouldn't kill him.
Maybe not the Brian you know,
but if he's using,
then he isn't that person anymore.
Agent Harris, let me ask you a question.
- You have kids?
- No.
Right, so this will make it difficult
for you to understand.
Brian is lost in the world,
and I can believe
that he is mixed up with this drug.
But you're wrong about one thing.
Our son is not a murderer.
<i>BRIAN: The news made this big thing
about my leather jacket,</i>
so <i>I</i> took the coat and scarf
from a coat check.
<i>Sorry for stealing your coat,
Tanner Evans,</i>
<i>but, to be honest,
you seem like a little bit of a douche.</i>
<i>Now I just have to get
into Jay Winston's suite.</i>
<i>I have tried to pick a lock before.</i>
[SLOW MUSIC PLAYS]
<i>Different kind of situation.</i>
MAN: <i>Keep a slight turning pressure.
The pick is used to manipulate the pins.</i>
<i>The torque wrench
is inserted into the keyway</i>
<i>in such a fashion as to push the pin
upward to unlock the pin cover.</i>
BRIAN: Three people at Manchester-Reid
are taking the <i>pills</i>
<i>and two of them die inside 18 hours?</i>
<i>This isn't a suicide. Someone's
killing these guys for their NZT.</i>
The first <i>pill I</i> took
lasted about 12 hours.
<i>I</i> have time to make one more move
before <i>I</i> come down.
You get lost in your work.
You didn't hear me come in.
It's not there.
- What do you want?
- I can't tell you who killed Eli yet.
But I can tell you a lot.
You're an FBI agent.
You can go places I can't.
You have resources I don't.
We're gonna figure out
who really did it.
If you hand me my gun,
I probably won't shoot you.
There are other people
at the bank using NZT.
One of them is named Jay Winston.
Right now he's lying dead
in a hotel suite in SoHo.
It's set up to look like a suicide,
but I think the same person
killed Eli and Jay.
If Winston had the drug,
that gives you motive to kill him.
Does it give me motive
to come here and tell you about it?
Someone is killing the people
who are using NZT at Manchester-Reid.
That's Jay Winston's laptop.
He has several emails from someone
with the user name Hapaboy.
There's nothing that says what Hapaboy's
name is, but he used to work with Jay.
He's atone of the big banks.
I just don't know which one.
He knows Jay was using something
to get ahead. He wants in.
Your story's got lots of threads
for me to pull on.
Most lies told by addicts do.
What is it with you? Some part of you
has to believe I'm right.
That's why you didn't shoot me
on that platform.
Oh. You've lost someone in your family
to addiction.
<i>Night</i> o! the Gun, How To Stop Time,
those are memoirs by addicts.
- Was it your mother?
- Stop.
I'm serious. Now.
No, wait. That's the most recent picture
of your dad.
It's at least ten years old.
You think I'm impressed
that you can stomp around in my life?
- You're not smart You're high.
- I'm not lying, though.
Leave.
I'm not gonna take your gun.
I know you'd get in trouble for that.
How's my father?
You wouldn't know all that
without talking to my parents.
He looks really sick.
<i>T spent the night in a hotel
that was closed for renovations.</i>
<i>My stomach did backflips
as soon as the pill wore off.</i>
<i>I told the FBI everything, except for
the name o! the third guy taking NZT,</i>
<i>Adam Honeycutt.</i>
<i>If he's still alive, he has pills.</i>
- Hey.
- Hapa, that's Hawaiian.
It means someone of mixed heritage.
Can you help me hit the HR departments
on Wall Street,
see if there's a trader
with a Hawaiian background?
- Someone about Eli's age.
- You're checking Finch's story?
He breaks into your apartment,
holds your sidearm on you.
I can't figure out why, though.
It was a huge risk.
Plus Brian gave me good information
and then he left my gun behind.
- Would a guilty guy do that?
- Brian?
Finch, whatever.
<i>He'!-</i>
- I'll do it.
- Thanks.
No, look, wait, wait, wait! Wait.
Do you know who I am?
I didn't kill Eli. I didn't kill Jay.
I came here for an NZT pill.
No! No, wait! I was gonna steal it.
I was gonna steal it, OK?
But only to prove who killed Eli.
And to help my dad, OK?
Listen, I'm not what they say
on the news. I'm not a bad person.
But I need help, OK?
Oh, God.
I believe you. I believe you.
Oh, God.
Eli used to talk about you all the time.
He was jealous of you.
He gave up. You never did.
Look, I can help. I'll get you a pill.
[RATTLES]
<i>BRIAN: Just a <i>rattle, right?
No big deal.</i>
<i>But it made me curious.</i>
<i>Adam's apartment was immaculate,
like OCD immaculate.</i>
<i>Everything was symmetrical.</i>
<i>Almost everything.</i>
<i>The plant on the right, it's maybe
two inches higher than the other one.</i>
[GROANS]
You were running out of NZT.
You took care of Eli and Jay.
- You took their pills.
- Yeah, I should have got rid of that.
Your buddy Eli was a snake.
He shorted the market using my research.
So really the biggest bonus,
that money clip, they were mine.
He was a good person and you murdered
him and you're going to jail.
You planning on going to the police?
Hey, you wanna call 'em right now?
I mean, I can't wait to tell 'em
how I shot the fugitive
who came looking
for some drug called NZT,
which, by the way, Brian, I'm not
stupid enough to keep where I live.
Here's how I see it. Maybe you pass out
from that hole in your leg.
Maybe you get arrested.
Or maybe I find you
before anyone with a badge can.
Either way, works out fine for me.
[GROANS]
[PHONE RINGS]
- Hello?
- Guess what?
I was wrong about Hapaboy.
- Brian?
- Mm-hm.
- It's Finch?
- Um... I know.
His real name is Andrew Benn.
He's been vacationing in Honduras
the last two weeks.
The killer's name is Adam Honeycutt,
and, uh, I can't prove it yet, but, um,
he did kind of, uh... he shot me.
- What?
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>Are you</i> at a <i>hospital?</i>
- <i>No. I... I...</i>
But they train you guys, right,
to patch up bullet wounds?
Like in case of emergencies
or something?
- They tell us to get to a hospital.
- Yeah, well, I can't do that, so...
You want me to coach you
through patching a bullet wound?
- Why would you expect me to do that?
- Because I'm innocent.
Where is the bullet?
Is it in your leg still?
I don't know.
No, I think it just grazed me.
<i>Is the blood bright red or is it dark?</i>
- Dark, I think.
- OK, that's good.
- That means it didn't hit an artery.
- Mm.
<i>We're gonna patch the wound.</i>
If there's any cloth in there,
that can get infected.
<i>- OK.
- So do you have a knife?</i>
- Do you have tweezers or something?
- Uh...
- Tweezers?
- <i>Yeah.</i>
Yeah, uh-huh. I...
What are we using these for?
Cos I can't go digging around
in my own leg.
Yes, you can. Think about something else
and just do it.
Uh, OK, how? How am I supposed
to think about something else?
Um... You like egg creams, right?
<i>The</i> ones <i>from Isaac's on Forest Hills?</i>
Yeah. How did you know about that?
I saw a picture in your house.
Hey, you know something? Um...
My mom always wanted me to be a doctor.
Yeah, instead, I...
I turned out to be...
...nothing, I guess.
<i>Brian, you're gonna
get through this, OK?</i>
<i>I am gonna talk you through this.</i>
Oh!
<i>Brian?</i>
- BRIAN: What are you doing?
- Combat gauze, stitches.
It's not perfect,
but you won't bleed out.
Unless you get your dumb ass shot again.
Her bedside manner's a little
unorthodox, but you are in expert hands.
It's about time you and me talked.
[GROANS]
- [COUGHS]
- Do you know who I am?
Oh. Oh, God.
I've been tracking you since you bumped
into the FBI at your friend's apartment.
Then when they last traced your call,
one of my sources intercepted
and... here we are.
Why? I'm nobody. Everybody says
you're gonna be president soon.
I haven't officially announced that yet,
but I don't even know if I'm gonna run.
Do you know how much time we get off
in the Senate? It's shocking.
I don't know if I can give it up.
One NZT pill. I give this to you.
If you're not the killer,
you can go prove it.
But what are you gonna do after that?
Go back to temping?
Every day a little closer to 30, 40.
I know what that's like.
- It's lonely.
- God.
Your body craves it
faster and faster, yeah.
You think it's bad now,
it's only gonna get worse.
You actually might remember this moment
as the last time you felt vaguely human.
But it doesn't have to be
that way, Brian.
Hook a pill this morning. I've taken
a pill every morning for four years.
I can't remember
the last time I felt bad.
That's not true.
No, I had a headache two years ago.
- How... how... how d'you do that?
- That.
Millions of dollars of private research.
It works on a cyclical enzyme system.
You don't know what that means.
It doesn't matter.
All you need to remember is that every
so often you take one of these shots...
...and you can have as much NZT
as you want with no side effects.
You're on the verge of having a life
most people can't even begin to imagine.
Can you remember what it's like
to be inside your mother's womb?
I can.
I think about it when I need to relax.
Have you ever thought about
why people have to age?
Is it inevitable? I'm not sure.
So, wait.
What the hell are you offering me?
You're offering me one pill?
Well, if things go the way
I expect they will,
you're gonna have as much NZT
as you need.
Why? Why would you help me?
I need somebody in a position
that you soon will be qualified to fill.
But one thing. This conversation
is here and now and nowhere else.
You describe it to the FBI,
to your parents, to anyone,
I will let you die more painfully
and slowly than you can fathom.
So what's it gonna be, Brian?
You ready to become
somebody who matters?
<i>BRIAN: One pill.
One last chance to prove I'm innocent.</i>
There's one piece o! evidence
<i>Adam</i> wouldn't get rid of.
<i>I just have to get to it.</i>
Hey, buddy. Are you sure
you're wearing the right name tag?
What? Yeah.
You ever see one of those instructional
videos about pickpocketing?
All you have to do
is create one slight misdirection
and you can steal just about anything,
like this gun.
Hey, don't worry about it, Francis.
I'm not gonna hurt anyone, OK?
Excuse me, everyone.
I'm robbing the place.
Sorry. Just try to stay calm.
- You can hit the silent alarm now.
- You want me to hit the alarm?
Call the FBI too.
Ask for Rebecca Harris.
Tell her Brian Finch just walked in here
with a gun.
There's a lot of people out there, huh?
What are we doing here, Brian?
Did you know that Adam Honeycutt
does his banking here?
He had to fill out
financial disclosure forms
when he came over to Manchester-Reid,
I read it all.
He told me he doesn't keep any NZT
in his apartment,
but according to the manager here,
he has a safety deposit box downstairs.
Let's go see what's inside.
Look at that watch.
[RATTLES]
Do you see that?
That's Eli Whitford's blood.
- I see it.
- Well, in that case, I surrender.
<i>REPORTER: The police are still trying
to piece this all together.</i>
<i>A short time ago,
we spoke with the victim's mother.</i>
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.
I just got copies
of Brian Finch's CT scans.
You've seen the NZT files.
Does that look right?
Brian took at least two doses of NZT.
His brain should be rewiring itself.
And yet he presents
as a perfectly healthy 28-year-old.
Brian's immune
to the side effects of taking NZT.
We don't know how,
but we plan on learning.
You wanna study Brian to figure out
how to make a safe version of the drug.
Whoever created NZT,
still a mystery, by the way,
may be out there giving it to anybody.
This is an arms race, Rebecca,
and Brian could help us win it.
He's a person, a good one, actually.
Am I the only one
that's thinking about this?
If Brian's gonna take NZT anyway,
then every time he takes it,
he basically becomes
the smartest person in the world.
That's a resource.
Let's make it our resource.
You're talking about
putting him to work?
Call him a consultant.
We can still study him, yes.
But make the bank charges disappear.
Let's move him into the safe house
in Greenpoint. I'll be his liaison.
You trust him with that kind of power?
I'm not sure I trust anyone with that
kind of power, but if we keep him here,
I can watch him and we can use him.
Brian has the potential
to be more effective
than every agent
in this division combined.
- No.
- No?
Not unless you can get my father
a new liver.
Do that, I'll do whatever job you want.
- We don't work that way.
- Well, start.
Someone somewhere up the food chain,
they can move him
up the transplant list.
If I'm as important as you say I am,
then you find that person. Or don't.
Brian, you're out on bail.
You could go to prison.
And even if you don't, do you really
wanna go back to your old life?
I'd do anything to save my dad.
[KNOCKING]
- Heard you got some luck.
- Brian.
They're really operating tomorrow?
You know, you don't have to pretend
that this is a surprise.
The lady from the FBI
was in this morning to visit me.
She wouldn't give me any details,
but she said that...
...she said that you made this happen.
What happened to you?
You look different.
Yeah, I'll tell you
all about it sometime.
- Oh, boy, I'm proud of you, kid.
- You don't even know what I did.
I don't need to know what you did.
I woke up this morning feeling scared.
Tomorrow I'll wake up feeling hopeful.
You did that.
You saved my life.
Thank you.
You were right, you know,
about my father.
He used for ten years when I was a kid.
My mom finally moved me and my sister
out of the house
in the middle of the night.
He cleaned up after I joined the Bureau.
He came to see me one night last year
and... something was off.
He... said he'd been blind
his whole life,
but now, tonight, he could see.
When he left, he said the next time
I saw him, he'd be a different person,
a better person.
Three weeks later
his body floated up in the East River.
I'm sorry.
You know what I remember
about that night?
His eyes. They had this shine.
Just like yours did
on that subway platform.
That's why you didn't shoot me.
I think my father was on NZT that night,
and if I can figure out
where it comes from,
maybe I can figure out
what happened to him.
You agreed to do a job, Brian.
It's time.
Just don't lie to me. Ever.
[EXHALES]
You sure about this?
I couldn't help my father.
Maybe I can help you.
