I'M ONE OF THE SIEN YI CLAN,
FOUNDED BY OUR GREAT HERO
HIU FEI.
I'M NO BETRAYER.

MY LIFE,
I WILL CHALLENGE YOU.
I ADVISE YOU

GRANDPA,

GO AHEAD.
[ Chuckles ]
FINISHED.

[ Groaning ]
GO AROUND !
HEAD UP !

[ Groaning ]
YOU'RE A VERY BIG MAN
WITH A VERY SMALL BRAIN.
HE'S CALLED THE GREAT BEAR,
BUT HE LOOKS SMALLER FROM HERE.
YOU WANNA FIGHT ?
[ Stony Egg ]
HELP !
[ Groaning ]
YOU NEARLY
CRUSHED ME DEAD !
[ Groaning Continues ]
YOU WANT
THE MONEY BACK NOW ?
NO, I DON'T !
I'M GOING.
OF COURSE
YOU CAN GO NOW.
DON'T TRY

W-WHAT SHALL WE DO ?
GET HIM UP RIGHT NOW.
[ Grunts ]
LET'S GO.
MMM.
GOOD WINE.
IT'S FROM

SAME SHOP AS USUAL,
BUT IT'S MUCH BETTER.
MUCH MORE THAN USUAL.
YES, MUCH MORE.
[ Chuckles ]
GOOD BOY.
WHERE DID YOU GET
THE MONEY ?  HUH ?
I WAS VERY LUCKY.
I FOUND SOME MONEY
OUT IN THE STREET.
THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT IT
FOR YOU.
YOU WERE LUCKY.
YES.
YOU GO OUT AND SEE
IF YOU CAN FIND
SOME MORE MONEY.
THE TRUTH.
WHAT'S THAT ?
ONE BECAME TWO,
TWO BECAME FOUR,
FOUR BECAME EIGHT.
OH.
YOU'VE BEEN GAMBLING.
AND THEY ASKED YOU
TO RETURN IT.
YES !
HOW DID YOU KNOW, GRANDPA ?
AND YOU SHOWED THEM
YOUR KUNG FU.
NO, I DIDN'T.
I MERELY STRUCK A POSE,
AND THEY LET ME LEAVE.
AND WHAT POSE WAS THAT ?
WELL, IT WAS VERY BASIC.
YOU TWIT !
I'LL PRACTICE.
YOU ENJOY YOUR WINE.
WAIT.
NO NEED

WELL, I'LL TAKE
THE SHORT ONE, THEN.
OHH !  AAH !  AA-AAH !
WAIT !
WE'RE NOT THROUGH.
[ Whimpering ]
YOU MISSED.
THIS IS CALLED
LONG BUT POWERFUL.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.
LONG AND SHORT,

[ Gasps ]
NO, THIS IS IT !
- THAT'S THE END.
- WHAT ?
THAT'S THE END !
BUT I'M STARTING.
GRANDPA,
STOP OR I'LL DIE.
HOW WILL YOU LEARN
IF YOU STOP ?
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I SAID,
"DON'T TEACH OUR KUNG FU
 TO OTHERS" ?
BUT YOU INSIST ON DOING IT.
OUR KUNG FU ISN'T ILLEGAL.
YOU MUSTN'T TEACH OTHER PEOPLE,
OR I'LL THRASH YOU.
WELL, I'LL TRY.
BUT YOU MUST.
GO AND GET YOURSELF
A PROPER JOB,
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
[ Gasps ]
YOU IDIOT.
COME ON.  TRY IT.
[ Chuckling ]
MISTER, WILL YOU BUY--
BOY, WHY ARE YOU
SO HAPPY ?
[ Whimpering ]
[ Both Mock Sobbing ]
MISTER, WILL YOU BUY--
MISTER, WHY THE HELL
ARE YOU SO DAMN SAD ?
IS IT YOU OR ME
WHO'S LOST SOMEONE ?
NOW I'LL SERVE YOU.
HERE.
MISTER,
[ Sobs ]
THIS COMES WHEN
WE DON'T EXPECT IT.
YOU NEED SOMEONE...
TO HANDLE
ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS
FOR YOU.
AND NOW, REMEMBER
THAT WE HAVE ALL TYPES
OF CASKETS--
POOR TYPE, NORMAL TYPE,
RICH TYPE, SUPER-RICH TYPE.
AND IF SOMEONE COMES IN
DRESSED LIKE ME, THEN...
YOU SHOW THEM
THIS ONE HERE, HUH ?
AND IF SOMEONE COMES IN
DRESSED IN FILTHY RAGS,
THEN SHOW THEM THIS ONE HERE.
THIS TYPE IS MEANT
FOR THE LIKES OF YOU.
WHAT ?  HOW CAN ANYONE
BE BURIED IN THIS THING ?
IT'S ROTTEN.
WHY NOT ?  ALL THESE COFFINS
HAVE BEEN USED BEFORE.
AT LEAST
MORE THAN THREE TIMES.
MORE THAN THREE ?
THESE ARE SECONDHAND.
WHAT'S SECONDHAND ?
WHEN WE DIG THEM UP, THAT
IS CALLED SECONDHAND GOODS.
WHO WILL BUY THEM ?
EVERYONE.
MY FUNERAL PARLOR
HAS A MONOPOLY.
WE SELL THEM.
IS IT ETHICAL ?
EHH.
NO TALK OF ETHICS HERE.
REMEMBER.
OH.
ALSO, YOU WILL HAVE TO
REMEMBER THE VARIOUS BRANDS.
NOW, THIS IS TEAKWOOD,
ROSEWOOD, WILLOW WOOD,
AND THAT'S CARDBOARD.
WHEN CUSTOMERS COME,
KNOCK AND LET THEM HEAR.
BOSS,
IT SOUNDS LIKE PLYWOOD.
HEY, THEY'RE NOT
TO KNOW THAT.
YOU'RE DUMB.
COME OVER HERE.
NOW, MY PRECIOUS,
YOU'RE NOT FOR SALE.
IS IT FOR YOU ?
YES--  UH, NO !
IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT,
THEN I'M WILLING
TO SELL HER.
AH, I HAVE POLISHED HER
EVERY DAY.
AND, OH, DON'T FORGET
TO TELL THE CLIENT
HER GOOD POINTS.
WHICH ARE ?
LET ME SHOW YOU.
NOW, LIVING PEOPLE
WOULD FIND IT COMFORTABLE...
BECAUSE IT IS
COMPLETELY AIRTIGHT.
THEY'D SUFFOCATE.
BUT NOT WITH
A BUILT-IN FAN.
OH.
I WOULDN'T MIND
LIVING IN THERE.
LET ME DEMONSTRATE.
INSIDE.
[ Sighs ]
NICE AND COMFORTABLE.
SO COOL AND PEACEFUL.
LISTEN TO THIS.
[ Knocking ]
COME, LISTEN.
LISTEN TO THIS.
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE
CALLING ME.
OHH !  OHH !  OH !
[ Gasps ]
[ Chuckles ]
IT'S FRIGHTENING.
IDIOT !
WOULD YOU LIKE--
[ Chuckles ]
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TRY IT ?
IT'S TOO NARROW.
BUT IT'S NOT.
IT'S BIG ENOUGH
FOR THREE.
OKAY.
AAH !  OHH !
MY GOD !
WHAT THE HELL'S HAPPENING ?
I WAS ONLY DEMONSTRATING !
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO SHUT ME IN !
LET ME OUT OF HERE !
I'LL KILL YOU WHEN
I GET MY HANDS ON YOU !
YOU'LL BE IN HERE,
AND I'LL BE OUT THERE.
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO
TO ME, YOU LITTLE BASTARD ?
[ Stammering ]
AAAH !
I CAN'T GET YOU OUT.
HEY,
DID YOU FIND HIM ?
NOPE.
HE IS NOWHERE.
HEY, FIND HIM ?
NO !
DAMN HIS ASS !
WHERE THE HELL
HAS HE GOT TO ?
[ Grunts ]
I DON'T WANT TROUBLE.
IF YOU CONTINUE
TO FOLLOW ME,
I'LL BREAK EVERY BONE
IN YOUR BODY !
[ All Gasping, Chuckling ]
- BIG BROTHER.
- DAMN IT, WHO'S YOUR BROTHER ?
UH, WE THREE THINK
THAT YOU ARE THE GREATEST.
WE REALLY DO.
YOU WHAT ?
I CAN'T EVEN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF, YOU FOOLS.
YOU ALL WANT TO END UP
BEING LIKE THAT ?
BUT, MY BROTHER,
WE THINK YOU'RE THE GREATEST.
THE TIME IS RIGHT.
YOU CAN MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY.
RIGHT !
WHY DON'T YOU
MAKE IT, THEN ?
[ Chuckling Continues ]
I THINK
YOU'RE ALL MAD.
HEY ! HEY !
WE CAN'T MAKE IT
WITHOUT YOU.
I ALREADY HAVE PROBLEMS.
DON'T YOU
GIVE ME ANY MORE.
HEY, WAIT, WE WOULDN'T
DARE CAUSE YOU TROUBLE,
MY FRIEND.
IF I DO ANY WRONG,
I'LL CHANGE MY NAME
TO ROTTEN EGG.
RIGHT, AND YOU CAN
BREAK MY IRON HEAD
ANY TIME THAT YOU LIKE.
[ Laughs ]
HEY, YOU'VE
NOTHING TO LOSE.
COME WITH US
AND MEET OUR BOSS.
RIGHT.
OH, THEN MAYBE
I'LL COME ALONG WITH YOU.
WELL, NOW,
IT'S NICE OF YOU TO COME.
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF TI CHA'S PROPOSAL, HMM ?
TEACHER ?
WHO'S THE TEACHER ?
NO TEACHER.
OH !
MY NAME IS TI CHA.
SAID QUICKLY TOGETHER,
THEY SOUND THE SAME.
IT GIVES ME AN AIR
OF SUPERIORITY.
YOU MUST COME FROM JAPAN.
[ Great Bear ]
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ?
AN IMITATION.
[ All Laughing ]
THAT'S NOT FUNNY !
LITTLE GIMMICKS
ARE IMPORTANT...
RIGHT.
IF YOU WANT
TO SUCCEED.
RIGHT.

MY FRIEND, WHY DON'T YOU

YOUR MONTHLY SALARY

ON TOP OF THAT,
ANY FEES WILL BE SHARED
BY US BOTH.
ALSO, I'LL PAY
WHEN YOU FIGHT.
ISN'T THAT FAIR ?
YES !
YES !
ONE HUNDRED ?
[ Mutters ]
ONE HUNDRED.
I WANT IT, BUT THEN
THERE'S MY GRANDFATHER.
HE FORBIDS ME
TO FIGHT ANYWHERE.
YOU'VE NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S LIKE.
[ Chuckling ]
[ All Laughing ]
HEY !
[ Laughing Stops ]
ALL I KNOW IS,
I HAVE IDEAS.
NOW, ALL I WANT
IS FOR YOU TO FIGHT.
BUT MY GRANDPA !
YOU WAIT.
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
AND THAT IS ALL.
BUT WILL IT WORK ?
BUT OF COURSE IT WILL.
NOW, AFTER LUNCH
I'LL TAKE YOU TO SEE

WHAT IS
THE EVERYTHING CLAN ?
WELL, WE TEACH
EVERY TYPE OF KUNG FU.
THAT'S WHY
WE CALL THE SCHOOL
THAT NAME.
WHAT CRAP.
YOU'VE NOTHING.
HAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
WHEN WE STARTED,
TWO STUDENTS,
AND THEY'RE NONPAYING.
ISN'T THAT DISGRACEFUL ?
SO THEN, IT'S IMPORTANT
TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT NAME.
RIGHT ?
HAH, RIGHT.
MY YOUNG FRIEND, HELP ME.

NOW, THAT'S HARD.
WHAT DO YOU TEACH ?
[ Chuckles ]
WE TEACH THE S.S.S.

DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY
LIVING HERE ALONE ?
YOU ARE ALWAYS FOLLOWING.
HOW CAN I BE LONELY ?
CHEN PING FE,
YOU'D BETTER START DIGGING...
OR YOU WON'T BE BURIED.
[ Both Grunting ]
OLD MAN,

[ Groaning, Yells ]
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.
GRANDPA !
GRANDPA !
IF YOU HADN'T LEFT A TRAIL,
YEN WOULDN'T HAVE FOUND HIM.
WHO'S YEN ?
WHY DID HE KILL HIM ?
WHY DID HE KILL GRANDPA ?
[ Sobbing ]
HE KILLED HIM BECAUSE...
OUR CLAN FOUGHT THE CHING.
[ Sobbing ]
YOU'RE WITH OUR CLAN ?
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOUR GRANDFATHER
WAS LOOKING FOR ME.
YOU ARE--

YOU'RE NOT FIT

TELL ME, HOW THE HELL
COULD I HELP ?
EVEN WITHOUT KUNG FU,
HE'D WIN.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?

YOU CAN'T BEAT
A CRIPPLE LIKE ME.
HOW CAN YOU BEAT HIM ?
YOU GO, AND YOUR
GRANDFATHER'S BODY
WILL ROT HERE.
GRANDPA !
[ Sobbing ]
AS LONG AS YOU'RE ALIVE,

I CAN'T WITH YOU ON TOP.
WELL, I'M DOWN NOW.
THEN I CAN DO IT.

YELP.
OH, OH, OH, OH !
THAT WAS TOO EARLY.
MASTER.
[ Moans ]
KEEP WORKING.
[ Moaning ]
MASTER.  MASTER !
SUCH A LOT OF COMMOTION.
AND YOU SLEEP THROUGH IT
LIKE A PIG.
WHO'S BEEN HERE ?
IF SOMEONE HAD BEEN HERE,
YOU'D BE DEAD FOR SURE.
[ Gasps ]
WELL, I WILL HAVE TO SLEEP
WITH ONE EYE OPEN.
OH, LIKE THIS ?
IN KUNG FU,
YOU MUST LEARN TO USE
YOUR BRAINS AS WELL.
OTHERWISE,
YOU'LL TIRE YOURSELF.
NOW, ALREADY YOU'RE
LOSING YOUR VOICE.
SHOW ME.
I'LL TEACH YOU TO ADJUST
TO CIRCUMSTANCES.
NOW, SEE IF YOU CAN
GET PAST THAT DOOR.
[ Chuckles ]

USELESS BUM.
MASTER, CATCH !
WELL, NOT SO BAD, EH ?

I'M STILL ONE UP ON YOU.
[ Laughing ]
SHING LUNG,
I'LL GO GET SOME WINE.

[ Jangling Continues ]
[ Bells Jangling ]
[ Both Grunting ]
YOU--
[ Wheezing ]
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?
SPEAK UP.
[ Bells Jangling ]
WHY THE HELL
DID YOU ATTACK ME ?
[ Angry Grunting ]
DUMB KID.
AND HE'S CRAZY.
SIR, LET'S GO.
[ Grunts, Yelling ]
OHH !
[ Groaning, Grunting ]
GODDAMN !
[ Moaning ]
YOUNG MAN,
WHAT'S YOUR GRIEVANCE ?
YOU'RE CRAZY.
YOUR KUNG FU IS NOT BAD.
YOU DARE FIGHT ME
WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING.
YOU'RE DREAMING.
YOU !
YOU MUST BE TIRED
OF LIVING.
I'LL HELP.
HOW DARE YOU BITE ME.
[ Groaning ]
[ Moaning ]
YOU STUPID BOY !
CAUSING TROUBLE EVERYWHERE.
SORRY.  HE'S ALWAYS
CAUSING TROUBLE.
DAMN HIM !
LET'S GO HOME.
[ Yelling ]
LORD, I BEG
YOUR FORGIVENESS.
IF YOU'RE HIS GRANDPA,
YOU SHOULD TEACH HIM.
YES, SIR.
I'LL TAKE HIM HOME.
SORRY.  COME ON,
YOU STUPID BOY.
THE UNICORN !
HE'S DISAPPEARED.
HE CAN'T GET AWAY.
AAH !
YOU'RE SO IMPULSIVE.
FORTUNATELY I CAME
IN THE NICK OF TIME.
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU
YOU MUST CHANGE ?
I'M USELESS.
NO GOOD.
IT'S TOO LATE TO BE SORRY.
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU
DIDN'T GET INJURED BADLY
BY THEM THIS TIME.
LUCKY ?
HMM.
I AM GLAD YOU WERE
TOO ANGRY TO REMEMBER
OUR CLAN'S KUNG FU.
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE.
OTHERWISE HE WOULD
HAVE KILLED YOU.
THAT'S WHY HE ONLY
WOUNDED YOU VERY SLIGHTLY.
YOU WERE VERY LUCKY
TO GET AWAY WITH YOUR LIFE.
NOW,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR KUNG FU.
IT ISN'T TOO BAD.
IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE ERRATIC.
THAT IS WHY YOU FEEL
SO TIRED.
YOU CAN'T ATTACK WELL
BECAUSE YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR ENERGY.
THEN WHAT DO I DO ?
I THINK YOU KNOW...
OUR CLAN'S TECHNIQUES BY NOW.
WELL, NOW I WANT
TO TEACH YOU...
A NEW TECHNIQUE.
THIS TECHNIQUE...
WILL BE JIAN.
JOY, SORROW,
DOWN, UP,
REAL, IMAGINARY.
PLAY ON YOUR OPPONENT'S
EMOTIONS...
AND AFFECT
HIS JUDGMENT TO WIN.
AND REMEMBER
THAT YOU ARE NOT ALONE.
[ Grunting ]
[ The Unicorn ]
NOW I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU
A NEW TECHNIQUE.
IT'S DERIVED
FROM THE WIRE FIST.
YOU MUST USE YOUR BRAIN
AND BODY TOGETHER,
THEREBY EXERTING YOUR POWER
TO THE FULLEST.
PLAY ON YOUR OPPONENT'S
BASIC EMOTIONS.
[ High-Pitched ]
HEE, HEE !
HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE !
 HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE !
JOY WILL HELP YOU
TO REMAIN HERE.
[ Hooting Continues ]
HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA !
HEE !
[ Exhales ]
ANGER ALLOWS YOU
TO ATTACK VICIOUSLY.
[ Hissing ]

SORROW WILL FOOL HIM
TILL THE VERY END.
