Ticket and passport, please.
Madam, I need
your ticket and passport.
Marji, stop running!
Look, there's Nioucha!
Marji, haven't you grown!
Got a present for me?
How was Paris? You saw Bruce Lee?
And the Eiffel Tower?
Welcome to Tehran.
We've missed you.
I'll take your bags.
No! I'll get them.
Hurry, everyone's waiting!
I remember...
I led a peaceful, uneventful life
as a little girl.
I loved fries with ketchup
Bruce Lee was my hero,
I wore Adidas sneakers
and had two obsessions:
Shaving my legs one day
and being the last prophet
of the galaxy.
Slip a pencil under your breasts.
If it falls, they're great.
If it sticks, they're crap.
Shake her
and you'll fill a box of pencils.
Calm down!
They let me see him last week.
The state he's in...
They said they'd free him though.
It'll soon be four years.
Don't worry.
This regime will collapse
sooner or later.
Mom, Marji kicked my head!
The dragon's revenge
is a bitter dish best eaten cold.
This dragon is heading
for a good thrashing.
I, Marjane,
future prophet, hereby decide:
First, everyone must behave well.
Second, everyone must keep
their word.
Third, everyone must do good.
Fourth, the poor must all eat
one roast chicken every day.
Fifth, old women
will never suffer again.
Well, Marji, in that case,
I'll be your first disciple!
You will? Great!
How'll you make sure
old women don't suffer?
It¡¯ll be forbidden.
Why didn't I think of that?
What's going on?
Down with the Shah!
I knew it!
I told you so!
I knew it!
This is a historic moment!
He'll pay for what he's done.
Your poor father
will be avenged at last.
The Shah can join his pals
in Washington.
Personally,
I think I like the Shah.
He was chosen by God.
Absolutely.
God told me so Himself.
God and my teacher too.
The Shah wasn't chosen by God.
Rubbish! My teacher...
That's what people say.
Here's what really happened.
The truth is, 50 years ago,
the Shah's father, an army officer,
wanted to overthrow
the Qadjar emperor.
Like Ataturk,
I shall modernize Iran
and make it a republic!
The English heard about this
and one day...
Hello. Why create a republic?
When you could be emperor?
Me? Emperor?
Of course!
It's better than being president.
You'll have all power.
A country like yours
needs a strong man like you
to lead it.
You have a point.
Besides, the religious leaders
are against a republic
and, frankly, they're right.
What do I have to do?
Nothing. Just give us the oil
and we'll take care of the rest.
I'm the king now!
All your property is mine!
So he was a moron!
Yes and no. He was a dictator
but he modernized Iran.
In a way, he loved his country,
unlike his successor.
I'm the king now!
I'm the light of the Aryans.
I'll make this country
the most modern one ever!
Our people will regain
its splendor.
Yes, the Shah's father was cruel.
He jailed your grandpa.
But his son is ten times worse.
Grandpa was in jail?
Yes. He had royal blood.
He was a Qadjar prince.
The Shah's father ruined him.
He was jailed above all
for being a communist.
My grandpa was a Qadjar prince
and a "communiss".
Dear God! You're alive!
I was worried sick.
They opened fire on people.
We had a close shave, Grandma!
The soldiers cornered us.
Those bastards took my film.
They held us for hours.
Marji was so excited.
She went on about proles,
peasants, the class struggle
and that bearded guy,
Che "Guevero"...
The boy shot next to us
wasn't even 20:
What is this country?
It's a shit-hole now.
Down with the Shah!
Here we go again.
Down with the Shah!
Marji, go to bed. Right now!
Down with the Shah!
I understood your revolt.
Together, we shall try
to march towards democracy,
building the future hand in hand.
Siamak! You're out!
Hello, Ebi.
It's Siamak. He's back.
Hello, Tadji.
Come in.
We're so glad you're alive!
Come in!
Don't just stand there!
This must be Marjane!
How you've grown!
You were just a baby before.
And now you're a young lady!
Who is that guy?
My father. He was in jail.
He's a hero.
They were scientists
who knew the whole body.
They knew what caused the most pain.
They whipped me so much
with cables,
my foot isn't like a foot anymore.
And why?
The foot's nerves
are linked to the brain.
The pain's incredible.
Our torturers were trained
by the CIA.
They certainly knew their stuff.
What happened to Hamid?
Hamid was killed.
As a guerrilla member,
he suffered hell.
He had cyanide on him just in case
but he wasn't able to use it.
He knew the worst torture.
The loser gets tortured to death.
Cool!
What kind of torture?
We'll hit him on the head
with a cable!
But first he has to put this
in his mouth
and chew three times!
Look! It's Ramine.
I heard that his dad
was in the Shah's secret police.
His dad killed a million people
with his own bare hands.
A million?
Absolutely! In their name,
we'll teach Ramine a good lesson.
We'll rip his eyes out!
Marjane!
What are you up to?
Marji found nails!
We'll beat Ramine up.
We'll rip his eyes out!
What if I nailed your ears
to the wall?
Go to your room and stay there
until I say so!
What's wrong with you?
That's no way
for a future prophet to behave.
But, Lord, Ramine's father
killed people!
Marjane!
That's not poor Ramine's fault.
His father's crimes aren't his doing.
The wicked will pay one day.
Have faith in my justice.
You cannot wield it.
Your duty is to forgive.
Ramine...
What?
It's not your fault
your father's a murderer.
So I forgive you.
He only ever killed communists
and communists are evil!
In the months after the Shah left,
the country was euphoric.
Everyone had been a revolutionary.
Everyone had fought the Shah.
Our neighbor's birthmark
had magically become a war wound.
Our teacher, who loved the Shah,
made us tear up the photos
of the royal family in our books.
Political rallies thrived
and internal enemies
had become national heroes.
In this merry chaos
Uncle Anoush came into my life.
Things will get better now.
Nothing will stop the people.
We'll have a society
of justice and freedom at last.
As Lenin foresaw,
the proletariat will rule!
Uncle Anoush,
how long were you in jail?
Nine years.
Yeah! More than Laly's dad!
Are you married? A communist?
Marji, give your uncle
time to digest.
She's so inquisitive.
You're right.
It's good to be curious.
Have you digested?
It's time for bed.
Put your pyjamas on.
I'll come and tell you all that.
Elections soon.
Trust people.
They'll do all they can
to keep their freedom now.
It can't be worse than under the Shah.
I'm ready...
She'll turn your brain to mush.
I'm ready!
I'll start at the beginning.
I was 18 when my Uncle Fereydoun
and his friends
proclaimed the Iranian province
of Azerbaijan independent.
Fereydoun became the Minister
of Justice for the new republic.
Democracy is based on justice.
All men must be equal before the law.
I was his secretary.
I shared his ideas.
This is just a beginning.
We shall liberate Iran
province by province, city by city.
I'm sure we will.
It wasn't easy to follow him
for my father was loyal to the Shah.
My son is a traitor!
Go and join my idiotic brother.
You'll all end up shot, you hear?
Shot!
My father turned out to be right.
And one morning...
My God! Fereydoun!
I had to flee. I had no choice.
While my uncle faced his fate alone.
I walked for days
through the snow and blizzards.
I was hungry and cold but kept going.
I crossed the Alborz Mountains
to go to my parents in Astara.
Who's bothering me this late?
My God, Anoush!
Our son! He's half-dead!
My darling son!
My son...
My darling son, forgive me.
I couldn't stay.
The Shah's army was after me.
I went into exile.
I swam across the Aras River
and arrived in the USSR.
What did you do then?
I went to Leningrad,
then Moscow.
I did a doctorate in Marxism-Leninism.
But I missed my family more and more.
I tried to come back in disguise,
with forged papers
but it didn't work.
They arrested me.
You went to jail?
Yes. You know,
I'm telling you this
because you need to know.
The family memory must live on.
Even if it's not easy
for you to understand.
Don't worry, Uncle Anoush,
I'll never forget.
Were you married?
It's late now. Go to sleep.
This is for you.
I made it in prison.
Out of bread.
The people have voted
democratically at 99:99%
for the Islamic Republic.
Every revolution
has its period of transition.
Half the country is illiterate.
Only nationalism and religion
can unite people.
Mina and her family have left.
They say it's too dangerous here.
They found Mohsen drowned in his bath.
Don't worry! It will all be okay.
Siamak and his family have fled.
The bastards killed his sister!
Maybe we should leave Iran too.
So you can be a cleaner
and me a taxi-driver?
We'll purge
anti-revolutionary elements.
Only one law will prevail:
That of blood!
Marji...
They've arrested Anoush.
I know.
Dad...
It will be all right.
Do you want to help him?
Ok.
He's allowed one visit.
He wants to see you.
I'll go.
Ten minutes!
What a pretty dress!
What a beautiful girl!
You know that your visit
honors me?
You're the daughter
I'd have loved to have.
You'll see.
One day, the proletariat will rule.
Here.
I made you another bread swan.
It's the first one's uncle.
Star of my life...
What's wrong, my child?
Don't be sad.
Shut up, you!
You didn't stop them killing him.
It's not me. Men did it.
Shut up! Never come back again!
Get out!
Get out!
One year after the revolution,
Iraq attacked Iran.
Saddam struck a vulnerable country.
The revolution and purges in the army
had vastly weakened us.
To fight the external enemy,
the state exterminated
the internal one:
The opponents to the Shah's regime.
Arrests and executions
took place daily.
Everyone was afraid.
The new government adopted
even more repressive laws.
In two years,
every aspect of our lives changed.
And so did we.
All right!
On the heart for our martyrs!
Daughters and sons of Iran,
the war has killed our best children.
The truth will soon rise up
from their blood.
Whom did they die for?
For us!
Martyr!
Martyr!
Finish me!
What are you doing?
I'm suffering! Can't you see?
Go to class now!
The veil stands for freedom.
A decent woman shelters herself
from men's eyes.
A woman who shows herself
will burn in hell.
Seen this?
Our soldiers die every day
on our borders
to save our dear land from indecency.
Look!
Abba is for wimps.
Leave in single file. Hurry!
Mom, what's for dinner?
How about a nice chili?
Yeah! It¡¯ll make us fart!
Give me that!
I saw it first!
Sure, bitch!
Stop that!
Look at you, fighting like animals.
We should show solidarity.
What's her problem?
Who asked you?
Your scarf, sister.
You, woman!
Sir, you don't say "woman",
you say "madam".
Show some respect.
Respect you?
I fuck women like you
and dump them in the trash!
Get in!
Are you okay?
Yes, dear, I'm fine.
Move it!
Belt up, bastard!
Mom, you have to give me 50 tomans.
Really? What for?
They're selling tapes on Gandhi Avenue.
And the Bee Gees?
Mom! The Bee Gees suck!
"Estivie" Wonder.
Julio Iglesias.
Pink Floyd.
"Jickael Mackson".
Lipstick, varnish, playing cards.
Iron Maiden.
How much?
100 tomans.
50-60
50-50
What's that outfit?
And those punk shoes?
What punk shoes?
Those!
They're sneakers.
That shape is punk.
I'm on my school's basketball team.
Is that a basketball jacket?
What's that? Michael Jackson!
That symbol of Western decadence!
No, ma'am, it's...
Malcolm X!
Michael Jackson!
Your scarf, slut!
You're coming with us!
Sorry. It won't happen again.
Madam, my mother is dead.
My stepmother's so cruel.
If I'm late, she'll kill me!
She'll burn me with an iron.
She'll make my dad
put me in an orphanage!
Have mercy!
Please, ma'am, have mercy!
Today, our army destroyed
63 Iraqi tanks and 26 fighter planes.
Our martyrs' blood irrigates our land
and feeds deserts of hope.
To die a martyr is to inject blood
into the veins of society.
Is everything all right,
Mrs. Nassrine?
No, it isn't.
They gave my son this at school.
They said that if he fights and dies,
this key will get him into heaven.
This plastic key!
They said heaven is full of food,
women, gold houses and diamonds!
Women?
He's fourteen. Women interest him.
I've suffered so much.
I've raised five children with my tears.
Now they want to swap my oldest
for this key.
I've always followed religion.
I've prayed, I've worn the veil,
I've obeyed.
But I can't believe in anything
anymore.
It's me!
They arrested the Roshanis.
They found alcohol and playing cards.
Why are you covering your head?
For your husband.
That's how we were brought up.
Don't worry.
I'll talk to your son.
Thanks to my parents,
her son never went to war.
With the air raids,
government repression
and spying neighbors,
life tried to follow its course.
To make everything bearable,
people had parties...
safe from prying eyes.
They were often boozy.
Alcohol was banned
but my uncle supplied us with wine.
He had built a winemaking lab
in his basement.
Mrs. Nassrine, who cleaned for him too
helped crush the grapes.
God forgive me...
Attending parties was risky.
But it was the only freedom
we had left.
Come on! Get out!
ID, registration, license.
OK!
Come here!
Breathe out!
Been drinking?
No.
Liar!
You westernized trash!
Enough!
I work for this land.
How dare you?
Forgive him.
Shut up!
I could be your mother.
How old are you?
15? 16? My daughter is 13
Without your wife, you'd be in hell.
Thank you!
Get in. Let's see
if you have bottles at home.
Grandma, Marji, go up first.
I'll stall them.
Empty all bottles of drink.
But how?
Don't worry, I was used to it
with your father.
I always had to hide his tracts.
Our neighbor is an elderly man
with a heart condition.
Any sudden noise could kill him.
Perhaps we can work something out...
Where are you two going?
I have diabetes, my boy.
Without syrup, I'm going to faint.
Diabetes? Like my mother.
All right.
Where are they?
Arrogant but no ideology.
A few bills made them forget.
You didn't throw it all out?
Yes, we did.
Shit...
It's his heart again.
They were after communists
near our home.
They threw a grenade.
Taher couldn't take it.
I found him lying in the living room.
It will be all right.
No, it won't be.
He needs open-heart surgery.
They can't do it here.
They say he has to go to England.
I went to see the hospital director.
You won't believe it.
Know who he is?
My old window washer!
I pretended not to know him
so as not to humiliate him.
With the borders closed,
only the very sick can go abroad.
It's his third coronary.
He needs an operation abroad
or he'll die!
We'll do our best.
If God wills it, he'll get better.
It all depends on God.
I need your authorization
to get a passport.
If God wills it.
With a beard and a suit,
some dumb window washer
runs a hospital now!
My husband's fate
depends on a window washer!
He's so religious
he won't look at a woman!
The dumb jerk!
I know someone who makes passports.
Hoped what he can help to be busy
It will all work out.
Wait. I'll come too.
Where did I put it?
Here it is!
Look at this.
Good as real, huh?
A whole month's work went into this.
You're cute. What's your name?
How long to make a passport?
Passport?
Passports are in high demand.
They're how I make my living now.
Usually, it takes two weeks.
But I can do it in one.
Perfect, but hurry.
It's only Niloufar.
Meet Ebi. I told you
about his brother Anoush.
Hello.
She's a communist too.
Her brother was my messenger boy
so I hide her here.
It's the only place she's safe.
Is he dumb or what?
He'll get crushed.
There! What did I tell you?
Don't look. It's horrible.
Stop it!
What a load of crap.
The Japanese gut themselves
or make hideous monsters.
That's all they ever do.
Grandma, will Uncle Taher die?
Of course.
You think so?
If he can't get a passport,
he's had it.
He smoked too much.
Bullshit!
His heart's not sick from cigarettes.
His kids are too far away.
A portion of beans,
piping hot, please.
Children always leave. That's natural.
But having to part with them at 13
because of some war,
that breaks your heart.
In Taher's shoes,
I'd be dead and buried by now.
God damn those barbarians.
May God hear you.
Khosrow, it's you...
Is the "package" ready?
They arrested Niloufar
and trashed my place!
Khosrow
Niloufar was executed.
Khosrow fled to Turkey
and then to Sweden.
Three weeks later,
we buried Uncle Taher.
The war intensified.
Let me through.
Excuse me.
Let me through.
Stay here.
I live over there.
Go on.
Marji!
Mom!
Are you hurt?
No, sweetie, we're fine.
Where did it land?
The Baba Levy's house.
Baba's house...
Under our new government, we don't
have political prisoners anymore.
Ma'am?
Our liberty cost a lot
but now we have it.
Ma'am...
What now, Satrapi?
My uncle was jailed by the Shah
but the new regime had him shot.
We have gone from 3,000 prisoners
under the Shah
to 300,000 with you.
How dare you lie to us like this?
Stop that!
Who was it?
The principal.
Marji told her teacher off.
Again?
Just like her uncle.
What? You want her
to end up like him? Executed?
You know what they do?
You know what they did to Niloufar?
It's illegal to kill a virgin
so a guard married her
and took her virginity first!
You know what that means?
If they touch you, I'll kill them!
Shortly after,
they decided to send me abroad.
Since I had attended
the French school in Tehran,
I went to the French school in Vienna.
My father got me a visa.
I'd stay with my mother's friend
and her family.
The day before I left,
Grandma slept at our house.
Every morning, she'd put jasmine
in her bra to smell good.
When she undressed,
the flowers fell from her breasts.
It was magical!
How come your breasts
are so round at your age?
I soak them in a bowl of iced water
for ten minutes every day.
I'll miss you.
I'll come to see you.
Listen... I don't like to preach
but here's some useful advice.
You'll meet a lot of jerks in life.
If they hurt you, remember
it's because they're stupid.
Don't react to their cruelty.
There's nothing worse
than bitterness and revenge.
Keep your dignity
and be true to yourself.
It will be all right.
No tears. Think of your future.
Europe awaits you.
When you get to Vienna,
have a Sachertorte.
It's a delicious chocolate cake.
We'll come to visit.
You're a big girl.
No tears.
Dad!
Enough... You have to go now.
Never forget who you are
and where you're from.
My daughter...
Mom!
My little Marji!
Europe awaited.
But not the way I imagined.
After a few days
at my mother's friend's,
she decided her place was too small.
She found lodgings
where I'd be fine
or so she said.
What?
I was delighted
to find stores packed with goods
that had vanished at home.
For a while, the supermarket
was my favorite pastime.
My favorite pastime.
My favorite pastime...
In short,
I needed to make friends fast.
Luckily, at school,
I understood the others
and they understood me.
Got a smoke?
I was a center of interest
for all outsiders.
People like Momo, Thierry,
Olivier and Eve.
My nationality and story
fascinated them.
You saw a revolution and a war?
Well, yeah...
You saw lots of dead people?
A few.
That's wild!
I was soon part of the gang.
Momo introduced me to nonchalance,
the concept of forced nihilism
and Vienna's sub-culture.
I had trouble adapting at first.
But then I thought, "Why not?"
I convinced myself
I'd found my place.
But I wasn't like them.
As school holidays reminded me.
Shit! Christmas again!
With the whole damn family too!
All because of some Yankee bullshit.
Santa Claus wears red and white...
Because he was a Coca-Cola mascot.
I'll be bored shitless in Monte Carlo.
Monte Carlo's nothing.
I have to go to Brazil to see my dad.
It's a 13-hour flight!
Holidays are crumbs
to keep the proles happy.
If the anarchists had won,
we wouldn't work at all.
Is everything all right, dear?
Good. What are you doing
for Christmas?
Well?
She's spending it with friends.
Be careful.
So you need anything?
Make the most of it. Lots of love.
Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables.
What a way to behave!
Whassup?
Don't eat like that.
You all eat in front of the TV.
Not from the pot. It's disgusting!
It's true what they say.
Iranians have no manners.
Is it true you were hookers
before being nuns?
That marked the start
of a series of moves,
from apartment to apartment.
First, Eve and her mother took me in.
Then I lived with 8 homosexuals.
Then in a maid's room on Floriangasse.
Then with friends.
And friends' friends...
I ended up at the home
of Frau Doktor Schloss.
She was a retired philosophy teacher.
To be honest, she was crazy...
The rent is 2,000 schillings.
You like dogs, don't you?
Yes, I love them.
Yuki has adopted you.
Dogs have a sixth sense.
They can tell if people are kind.
Over the next year,
I decided to fit in for real.
Certain aspects of Western culture
remained a mystery.
I had to educate myself.
From Sartre to Bakunin
via Zweig and Freud,
I read all I could.
But I realized
there were things I'd never understand.
That bastard Waldheim got elected.
Yeah, it's crazy.
Sickening.
I want to puke.
It can't happen.
There's a big demo tomorrow.
That's all hot air anyway.
Life is a void.
When man realizes that,
he can no longer live
so he invents power games.
Bullshit! Life isn't absurd!
Some people
give their lives for freedom.
Think my uncle died for fun?
You moron!
I was very confused.
I had a safe, frivolous life
while those I loved
knew the hell of war.
However hard I tried,
I was haunted by guilt.
I just wanted to live
like a girl of my age.
A big change was coming.
In a few months,
I became a young lady.
It was a time
of constant renewed ugliness.
First, I grew seven inches.
Then my face became longer,
my right eye grew, then my chin.
My right hand became huge,
then my left foot.
My nose tripled in size.
My chest developed.
My butt then restored
my center of gravity.
To cap it all, a huge beauty mark
decorated my nose.
See, Yuki, I told you:
She's a prostitute.
This music is such crap!
They're all assholes here.
Bakunin wanted bourgeois democrats
to adopt socialist resolutions.
Things could have changed.
Capitalism undermines us.
See what I mean?
You're right. Where are you from?
Marie-Jeanne, right?
Yeah, I'm from... I'm French.
I'd never have guessed.
I was in Paris. Know it?
Sorry, I need to join my friends.
Okay, fine. See you.
So you're French now?
Grandma, stop it!
I'm just asking.
I didn't know you were French.
It's not easy being Iranian here.
If I say I am,
they treat me like a savage.
They think we're all violent,
bloodthirsty fanatics.
Is that any reason to deny your roots?
You remember what I told you?
Be true to yourself.
Know what she told my brother?
She said she was French.
No?! I swear.
And he believed her?
Have you seen her?
Who'd believe she's French?
He wanted to hit on her?
Are you crazy?
I'd kill myself if he went out with...
Shut up, you bitches!
Yes, I'm Iranian
and, yes, I'm proud of it!
After three years in Austria,
I felt good at last.
Momo, Thierry,
Eve and Olivier had left.
I had new friends.
Birgit was a hippie
who looked like an old child.
At her house in the forest,
she threw "anarchist" parties.
The state had nothing to fear
because these "anarchists"
mainly drank beer and ate sausages.
At one of these parties,
I met Fernando.
When I saw him,
I knew he was the man of my life.
Marjane, are you there?
I've understood now thanks to you.
You've helped me discover myself.
If it didn't work with you,
it won't with any girl.
I know now: I'm homosexual.
It's so good to say it.
Thank you, Marjane!
You're welcome.
After that pathetic setback,
I swore off love. I swear off love.
Love is a petty bourgeois emotion.
But "life is life"
as some losers used to sing.
And, one November morning,
Markus came into my life.
Want a ride home?
I had finally found love.
Nothing scared me
and the future seemed bright.
Markus was going to be
a great writer.
He'd read extracts of his play
to me in his room.
We were one!
I got croissants, baby!
Wait, I can explain.
It's not what you think.
Marjane, I love you!
I love you!
I can't find my brooch.
I'm sure you've stolen it.
Not now. Leave me be.
No! You won't get away with it,
you thief!
Go to hell! I detest you!
You and your shitty dog!
How dare you say that about Yuki?
Where are you going?
You won't get away!
Go fuck yourself!
You thief! Give me my brooch back!
I'll call the police!
Come back!
What an idiot!
That bastard fooled me.
I'm an idiot!
How did I fall in love
with that scumbag, that miser...
Want a ride home?
Okay.
I need to get gas.
Shall we split it?
And his breath smelled like shit!
The jerk had a crap personality.
Fuck! Are you crazy? My eye hurts!
Let me see, honey.
It's okay!
Pretentious nerd. Writer, my ass!
His rotten play was a piece of shit.
The shit didn't have balls.
He didn't stand up to his mom for me.
****
****
****
****
A real wimp.
I always bought our hash too.
That dork stayed in the car
waiting for me!
He didn't care if I got arrested.
What an idiot I was. What an idiot...
That was my first night on the street.
There were plenty more.
A revolution had carried off
part of my family.
I had survived a war
but a banal love story
nearly killed me.
Is that it?
Are we awake now?
You had a close call.
You're lucky we found you in the cold.
You've had bronchitis.
I forbid you to smoke
a single cigarette.
You surname? Satrapi.
First name? Marjane.
Where do you live?
In Iran.
In Iran?
Can I make a phone call?
Hello?
Dad...
Marjane? Is that you?
We were so worried.
No news in two months!
Dad,
can I come home?
Of course.
Promise me, no questions.
I promise.
Here's your mother.
Marjane?
Mom, don't cry, please.
Come home, we're waiting for you.
Mom...
No one will ask you anything.
We promise.
Any forbidden goods, sister?
Pork, alcohol, playing cards, music,
films, fashions, porn?
No, sir.
Neaten your veil.
Yes, sir.
You may go.
Look! It's Marji! My little girl...
I didn't recognize you.
You're here... You've grown!
You're here...
The next day, I saw the mountains.
It had snowed. My father wondered
if he needed
snow chains to go to work.
We had breakfast together
as we used to.
My mother made me my favorite omelet.
Nothing had changed
but, deep down,
I knew nothing would be like before.
We talked about this and that.
They respected my wishes
and asked nothing about Vienna.
I was uneasy but also felt
the nightmare was behind us.
The future could be brighter
now the war was over.
The war is over. That's true.
But it's almost worse.
People don't know why we had a war.
Let her breathe. She just got back!
It's all right, Mom.
The West sold weapons to both sides
and we stupidly played
their cynical game.
Eight years of war for nothing.
A million dead for nothing.
The last days of it were terrible.
One month before the armistice,
Iraq bombed Tehran every day,
as if to wipe it off the map.
Towards the end, the regime got scared
because an army of opposition
had entered from Iraq.
The government feared the threat
posed by political prisoners.
The state adopted
a radical solution to the problem.
It gave the prisoners a choice.
Either they gave up their ideas,
swore loyalty to the regime
and did their time,
or they would be executed.
The majority of them were executed.
Now they name streets
after the war martyrs.
That's all the families have left:
Street names.
Walking in Tehran now is like
walking through a cemetery.
Lord, you've grown!
You'll grab God's balls soon!
Grandma!
So tell me everything. How was Vienna?
Well, it was different...
Remember Mina?
Sure, she's my cousin.
She's married, with two kids.
As dumb as ever.
You remember Shila?
Yes.
She's an ugly cow.
Her face is so hairy.
She's like a gorilla!
And you remember Modjeh?
I remember everyone.
She got divorced.
Apparently, he had a tiny dick.
Or so Shari says.
She told Mehri who told me.
You'll see them soon.
Oh, no! Yes!
You must speak good German now.
Yes, a little.
I can say, "Ich liebe dich."
Vienna reminds me of Empress Sissi.
Did you meet Romy Schneider?
Marjane, stars shine in the sky,
and you shine in my heart.
You look like a nun.
Who'd guess you were in Europe?
You think so?
You must have loads to tell us.
Not really...
Tell us about Vienna nightclubs.
I didn't really go to nightclubs.
I don't like them.
What?
Ever slept with a guy?
Yes.
Is it good?
It depends on the guy.
What?
You've slept with more than one?
Enroll in a prep class.
Get your nose fixed.
Be a cosmonaut. Dress better.
It's 90 degrees out there!
I'm sick of this thing!
Damn hairdresser,
you're unworthy of my son.
Hello, Anahita.
Marjane just went out.
Okay, I'll tell her. Goodbye.
You can't watch TV all day long!
Didn't you want to sit that exam?
You're wasting
the best years of your life.
See people! Get a change of scene!
They all piss me off.
There must be someone you like.
Just one among the 7 million here!
Yes, there was Kia,
an old childhood friend.
When I saw him,
I understood Grandma's words.
He's nearly dead.
Kia has been to war.
He has lost an arm and a leg.
I had fun with him.
We even laughed.
I realized my woes weren't much.
His whole life is ruined
but he can still laugh.
I suppose that's the only way
to put up with it.
I keep telling myself that
but I can't do it.
It's unbearable.
My life weighs down on me
but who can I talk to?
You understand?
Everyone around me has suffered.
I was a stranger in Austria
and now I'm one in my own country.
Your condition has a name.
It's nervous depression.
Effective treatment exists.
I'll give you some pills.
Sure you won't come with us?
The sea air will help.
No, I want to be alone.
Don't worry.
Why are you here, my dear?
Well, I'm dead.
Don't you know
your time hasn't come?
It hasn't?
You have to stir yourself, my girl.
Yes! He's right for once!
You have a lot to do! Get moving!
Go and do what you have to do.
Remember, the fight continues!
Right? Yeah, the fight continues.
I'm starving!
Haven't you eaten?
The idiot's on a diet.
You're crazy!
She got a copy of "Vogue".
She reads it all the time.
You've made a hit with him.
Stop, I'm blushing.
We'll now talk about Botticelli
and, in particular,
"The Birth of Venus".
We could also call this painting
"Spring",
like Botticelli's other allegory
in the Uffizi Gallery.
In this painting...
You there! What's so funny?
Want to bet I'll take my veil off?
Sure.
C'mon, how much?
400 tomans.
Go on.
In the early 1990s,
the age of great ideals was over.
After the Revolution,
so many students were imprisoned,
we didn't dare discuss politics.
The war was behind us at last.
We were so eager for happiness,
we forgot we weren't free.
Grandma, you're here?
Yes, I came to see you.
You're all dolled up!
Are you in love?
Yes, I was meeting him earlier.
The Guardians turned up.
I had a close shave.
Look how I'm made up!
I didn't know what to do.
But a guy was staring at me.
My only solution was to play
the poor, defenseless girl.
Brother...
Yes, sister.
A man just insulted me.
Where is the bastard?
We'll shut him up.
That's him on the steps there!
Shame on you!
Got a mother? A sister?
What if someone insulted them?
I didn't do anything!
I swear, on my mother's life!
What did they do to him?
They arrested him.
You find that funny?
Yes, don't you?
You're a selfish bitch,
that's what I think!
Grandma, I had no choice!
You had a choice!
Everyone has a choice!
Everyone always has a choice!
Your grandfather spent years in jail
for defending the innocent.
And your Uncle Anoush!
Have you forgotten why he died?
What have I taught you?
Integrity!
Does that word mean anything to you?
Shame on you!
The lady with the shoulder bag,
stop running.
The lady with the bag, stop running!
Hey you, don't run!
Why are you running?
I'm late for my class!
Maybe, but you mustn't run.
When you run, your behind
moves in an... obscene way.
So don't look at my ass!
This is crazy.
It's the same from every angle!
An anatomy class?
All you can see is her big nose!
You must all go
to the main campus immediately.
All absentees will be barred
for two weeks.
We simply cannot behave badly.
Our martyrs' blood
nourished our revolution.
Indecent behavior scorns those
who gave their lives for us.
And so I'd like the young ladies here
to wear narrower trousers
and longer headscarves.
They should cover their hair
and not use make-up.
Any questions?
If not, the meeting is over.
Yes?
You talk about our scarves and trousers,
you say we use make-up, etc.
As an art student,
I'm often in the studio.
I need to move freely
in order to draw.
A longer scarf would hinder me.
You say our trousers are too wide
even though they hide our shape.
Since these trousers
are the fashion right now,
is religion defending our integrity
or is it opposed to fashion?
You criticize us
yet our brothers here
have different hair and clothes.
Sometimes, we can even make out
their underwear.
Why, as a woman,
should their tight clothes
have no effect on me
while a shorter headscarf arouses them?
Good girl! That's like chopping
their tiny dicks off!
Take that hood off!
It makes me claustrophobic.
I forget I'm wearing it.
Never forget that!
Fear makes us lose our awareness.
It turns us into cowards as well.
You showed guts. I'm proud of you.
I want to leave.
To go where?
Who cares. The USA or Europe.
Where in Europe?
Anywhere. I'm sick of Iran.
What about us?
You'll come too.
I don't want to leave!
You're still nostalgic.
You'll soon be sick
of people's meddling.
Maybe, but in the West
you can die on the street.
Don't worry.
We'll manage somehow.
What's your relationship
with this man?
You know what happens now.
We call your parents.
They pay a fine or you get whipped.
When your mother and I were 15,
we'd walk hand in hand.
It was the same country though.
This is the way things are now,
my daughter.
You must be careful from now on.
Try to avoid seeing each other
away from home.
It's impossible!
We can't go anywhere.
We're like prisoners.
What kind of life is this?
Yeah.
We should get married.
Well?
Have you been crying, Mom?
No.
I wanted you to be independent,
educated, cultured...
Now you're marrying at 21!
I want you to leave Iran,
to be free and emancipated!
Mom, trust me.
I know what I'm doing.
ONE YEAR LATER
Seen my car keys?
Huh?
My car keys!
I left them on the table.
No idea.
They were just there.
We share nothing.
You're a great match.
The perfect couple.
Perfect, my ass!
Do you want my photo?
Jerk!
You used to say
how much in love you were.
It's easy to be in love
three hours a week.
Not when you share the same home.
Surely you're not getting divorced?
I don't know.
My sister left her husband last year.
As soon as she was divorced,
every man around
wanted to sleep with her.
The butcher made advances.
Then the baker too.
The greengrocer.
And even beggars!
Men all think their thing
is irresistible
and that a divorcee won't refuse
since she's not a virgin.
If life isn't hell, stay with him.
What got you in such a state?
Forgive me.
Of course.
But what has made you so sad?
Grandma! It's terrible!
What's so terrible?
I don't love Reza anymore.
I think we're going to separate.
So that's all it is?
I thought someone had died.
You're out of your mind...
You do this to me,
with my weak heart!
All these tears over some divorce!
Listen to me.
I did it 55 years ago
and no one got divorced back then.
I knew I'd be happier alone
than with a shithead.
But... There's no but.
The first marriage is practice
for the second.
You'll be happier next time round.
You're crying because you were wrong.
It's hard admitting your mistakes, hmm?
Where were you?
Why didn't you call?
Nima is dead.
What?
Nima is dead.
I'm leaving you.
It was time for me to leave.
I decided to go to France.
I had to wait three months for a visa.
I went to the Caspian Sea
with Grandma
to fill my lungs with its special air.
An air you find nowhere else.
I promised my grandfather
I'd make him proud.
Finally, I went to the prison
where Uncle Anoush lay
somewhere among thousands
of other innocents.
I swore to him to remain
as honest as possible.
Then came the day I left.
My father cried as usual.
You're going for good.
You're free.
Today's Iran is not for you.
I forbid you to come back.
Yes, Mom.
Grandma...
My little girl!
I never saw my grandmother again.
She died shortly after.
Freedom always has a price.
Terrible weather.
Where are you coming from?
Iran.
Grandma, you smell so good.
How do you do it?
I pick jasmine flowers every morning.
When I dress,
I slip them inside my bra.
That way, I always smell good.
That's great.
