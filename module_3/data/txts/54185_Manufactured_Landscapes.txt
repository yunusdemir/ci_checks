[Muted Bustle Of Work]
Man: Is there some way
I can actually talk about nature...
and kind of bring
a certain appreciation...
for what it represents?
That we come from nature, and that
we have to understand what it is...
so as not to harm it
and then to ultimately harm ourselves.
That there is an importance to have
a certain reverence for what nature is...
because we are connected to it
and we are part of it.
And if we destroy nature,
we destroy ourselves.
So I believe that as a fundamental
philosophical position...
when I look at the world.
So I started thinking, well...
maybe the new landscape of our time,
the one to start to talk about...
is the landscape that we change.
The one that we, you know, disrupt...
in pursuit of progress.
So, I'm trying to look at...
the industrial landscape...
as a way of defining who we are...
and our relationship to the planet.
It's— It's just this thing that's just
growing, and it's part of our economy...
and it's part of our politics, and it's a part
of how we elect our governments.
It's part of everything we do.
But it's this big machine
that started rolling...
and I'm not coming at it...
to celebrate or glorify the industry,
nor am I trying to damn it.
I'm just trying to say,
"Well, this is what it is".
So to show those types of images
of those types of places...
allows the viewer...
to begin to comprehend the scale.
So it's another landscape.
It is a landscape.
It's a different landscape.

Man: [Speaks Chinese]
Good morning, guys.
Group: [Responds In Chinese]
Good morning!
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
Under these
particular circumstances,
we can easily discover
many shortcomings.
They complain about us every day.
Watch the way you operate.
Also, watch those knobs for controlling
temperature and those for steam.
Don't laugh.
Don't talk.
You, stand behind him. Four in a row.
Stand straight. You, come to this row.
Regarding the unqualified material,
our group, 2B, did the worst.
Every time we worked on 7562,
if I didn't remind you,
then nobody would label the bad items,
so they got messed up.
They were scattered everywhere.
Besides this, the worst thing,
there were no labels for them.
[Chinese Continues]
So when the products were moved,
the bad ones went out as well.
I'm not a god.
I'm a human being, just like you.
I am only 1 person and you are 20.
When those materials were rejected,
the quality controller complained a lot.
This is the bad habit that exists
in our group, 2B.
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
Group: [Responds In Chinese]
Man: Edward? They want to know
how you like it so far.
Edward:
It's okay if we move—
Like trying to fill this area up here
is the, uh, most important.
Like, yeah, that one group,
the colored sh—
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
Edward: That's good. Eh, Noah?
Marching them all down here
is fantastic...
'cause I lose them down
at the other end anyways.
So you want the foreground to be full.
They're coming.
It's looking okay.
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
Edward: I wish that I had the light
about a half hour ago.
It's— It's deadened down a bit.
I'm hoping it opens up.
I think we're good. I'm just
shooting now. -Noah: Okay, good.
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
It should be good. No problem.
He is shooting now.
Edward:
That's good.
That's perfect.
Emcee:
Ladies and gentlemen, Ed Burtynsky.
[Applause]
Inspired by nature.
That's the theme here.
And I think, quite frankly...
that's where I started.
I had a bit of an epiphany
being lost in Pennsylvania.
I took a left turn trying to
get back to the highway...
and ended up in a town
called Frackville.
And I got out of the car and I stood up,
and it was a coal mining town...
and I did a 360 turnaround...
and that became one of the most
surreal landscapes I had ever seen.
Totally transformed by man.
And that— that got me to—
to go out and look at the largest
industrial incursions that I could find.
And that became the baseline
of what I was doing.
Edward: I guess in the back of
everybody's mind,
when you think of
extraction industries...
that we all know that
stuff comes from somewhere,
but we're disconnected from that.
So my images brought those landscapes
into our consciousness...
and for about ten years
I explored that kind of landscape...
through quarries and mines—
nickel or copper or iron ore.
And ones that had been going on
for long periods of time...
so that the evidence
of that accumulated taking—
in one frame
you can show the dimensions...
of our extraction
in the landscape.
Burtynsky:
When looking at China...
I was looking at that place
where all these materials coalesce...
and so they're coming in
from all around the world—
iron ore and aluminium
and, uh, wood.
All these things that China
has very little of.
And then these factories
are this place...
where all these materials
get formed into products...
and sent back out around the world.
[Hissing Of Machinery]
[Clatter Of Metal]
Woman: [Speaking Chinese]
We haven't sorted
these recycling materials in time.
Now there's too much to do.
You wouldn't start working
until you were told to.
You don't want to work?
Burtynsky: The other aspect
of what's happening in China...
is that a lot of the recycled materials
that are collected here...
are being taken to China by ship.
That's cube metal.
This is armatures, electrical armatures...
where they're getting the copper and
the high-end steel from electrical motors.
50% of the world's computers
end up in China to be recycled.
It's referred to as e-waste there.
And, um, the way they recycle
is that they actually heat up the boards...
and with pairs of pliers
they pull off all the components.
They're trying to get all the valued metals
out of those components.
But the toxic smells—
when you're coming to a town...
that's actually doing this kind
of burning of the boards...
you can smell it a good five or ten
kilometers before you get there.
Burtynsky:
I'm not usually known for portraits...
but I couldn't resist on this one,
where she's probably—
She's been through Mao, and she's
been through the great leap forward...
and the cultural revolution...
and now she's sitting on her porch
with— with this e-waste beside her.
It's quite something.
[Mixed Chatter In Chinese]
Man:
So— All right. No, higher.
Higher, a bit higher.
There we go.
Okay.
[Giggling]
[Mixed Chatter]
Woman: [Speaking Chinese]
It's not useable anymore.
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
So after you sort them out,
will you smash all of them?
Yes. All will be smashed.
Burtynsky: In one of the towns
that was the most notorious...
for e-waste recycling...
they were smashing monitors...
and taking— using the glass...
but inside the monitor...
was full of phosphors and of lead,
different types of cadmium, different—
pretty toxic, uh, heavy metals.
And— So all of this, of course...
would wash into the rivers,
would go into the— the soil...
and after every rain, it would get it
further and further into the water table...
to the point where the water table
is totally contaminated...
and they're now having to ship water in.

My name is Tan Yanfang.
Woman #3: [Speaking Chinese]
<i>How long have you been working here?</i></i>
Six years.
I can assemble 400 units every day
without overtime.
Woman #1: [Speaking Chinese]
The shell of the TSM Small Breaker
is made of the best quality materials
in the world,
including specialized parts
imported from Holland.
The products are mainly for...
Excuse me...
I feel so nervous.
<i>That's okay.</i>
Can I use...
Can I use my notes?

[Beeping Of Machinery]
- Man: Are we moving on now?
- Burtynsky: Yeah, we're gonna move on.
The light's really good.
Let's try and get some more stuff.
Man:
Yeah.
[Crackling Of Welding Torch]
[Hammering Of Metal]
Woman: [Speaking Chinese]
Changes here are huge.
My father told me when
he came here in the early '90s,
there were no ships being built.
Now it's getting richer here.
My mother is a welder, just like me.
My father is an assembler.
I failed to get into high school
and my uncle worked here.
That's why I came here to work.
Burtynsky: You might want
to pull this a bit for the sky.
Man:
You already got one, right?
Yeah, just 'cause I overexposed a bit
in the second one, so I want to pull it a bit.
Yup.
[Whirring Of Tool]
Burtynsky:
Yup.
Burtynsky: These ships carry, I think,
a great metaphor...
of, you know,
connecting us through seas.
The materials that we experience
all come through ships...
so they have become
the kind of reason...
that has allowed, um, globalization...
to take the proportions it has.
Man: [On Loudspeakers]
[Singing]
Man:
The high tide is at 13—
Burtynsky:
So 1:30 is high tide.
Man: They want it in farther
'cause they can get— they can work on it.
It's too far out for them to
get it together. -Right.
Burtynsky: I want to see if we can
actually walk up to that other big ship.
And how—Where do they anticipate it
to land? What's their best guess?
Man: They don't know.
It's all— It's all the will of God.
Burtynsky:
I like it.
[Hissing Of Torch]
Men:
[Chanting]
Burtynsky: At one point, I was shooting
a mine, and it was a silver mine.
Okay, it's a little dark.
I arrive in my car, made out of iron,
you know, filled with gas.
I pull out a metal tripod...
and grab film that's loaded with silver
and start taking pictures.
So everything that I'm doing is connected
to the thing I'm photographing.
Looking at these ships
in Bangladesh...
the connection was clear.
At some point,
I probably filled a tank of gas...
from the oil that was delivered
by one of these tankers.
[Mixed Chatter]
Burtynsky: These oil tankers still had...
sludge and crude
at the bottom of the ships...
that had to be scraped out,
and— and it was all done by hand.
You know, 18, 19, 20-year-old boys,
even younger...
in oil up to their necks.
It's very, very low-paid work
and very dangerous work...
so you rarely see anybody
over 30 at work there.
Burtynsky:
The whole idea of energy...
entered my work around 1997...
when I began to photograph
oil fields and oil refineries.
And I had this,
what I call an oil epiphany...
when one day I was driving
and started to think...
about how oil had affected my life...
and I was holding onto a plastic steering wheel...
that was probably made from oil derivatives...
in a car with paints that were oil...
looking through glass that was probably
heated through oil...
driving on black tar.
And I started to think about oil...
as a key building block
of the last century.
Burtynsky:
I thought of it as the oil party—
that, you know, there's this
great abundance of black liquid...
that gives us this mobility,
this freedom.
And I couldn't help but feel...
that, you know, China was kind of
either joining the last dance...
or the second-last dance
to this party...
that peak of oil is somewhere—
that either we're— we've hit it
or we're about to hit.
You know, no matter what we do,
we just can't get enough...
to supply the world demand.
So to look at China
and the way they're expanding...
to be the manufacturers
of the world...
is a very different energy footprint.
And because they're entering
late in the game...
it remains a question of how long
they'll be able to sustain.
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
There are lots of coal mines here.
Woman: Now you can see a lot of coal,
and coal here, of course.
Coal is mined on a large scale
to meet the energy needs of our country,
because our economy
is developing very fast.
But it brings some
environmental problems.
Did you just say
that large-scale coal mining
is to meet China's demands
in her economic development?
We came here for that.
I have to let you know
that he's going to publish a book
about the development
of Chinese industry...
and we understand that China
needs a lot of energy for development.
Woman: No shooting. No shooting.
Men: [Speaking]
He's just taking a picture.
Don't shoot, guys.
- Woman: Excuse me.
- Man: Yeah.
Woman: As far as I understand,
the problem right now—
- Yeah.
- I mean, this is my personal idea...
Okay.
...is that the court itself
has the very regulation—
Yeah.
...that no media is allowed
to come to this, uh—
Yeah. No, I understand that.
But my understanding is,
from Mr. Chen Ling this morning—
- I think, maybe he...
- You know? Yeah, no, no. That's okay.
Maybe Mr. Chendling does not know
that there is a certain regulation that, uh...
Yeah.
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
I understand it's quite windy today.
Woman: It's very dirty, very dirty.
I don't think it's a good day
to make beautiful pictures.
Woman: [Speaking Chinese]
It's very gloomy here.
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
But through his camera lens, through
his eyes, it will appear beautiful.
For example, even this industrial
waste, it's kind of like garbage.
Still it appears beautiful
through his camera.
Take a look at these pictures.
This book is a retrospective
of his past 20 years' work.
Woman:
Really, it has—
Man: [Speaking Chinese] Most of
the pictures were taken in Canada.
Here are some pictures of mines.
The book we are making
needs a picture...
[Ignition Of Engine]
Actually, our concern is that it will
cause some negative influence.
- Man: Well, let's go see.
- Burtynsky: Let's go see.
Man: [Speaking Chinese] Let's
just go to the site and have a look.
We don't even know what we're talking
about. Then we'll come back and talk.
- Woman: Right. Okay. Let's—
- Okay, so let's do that.
[Rumbling Of Machinery]
Burtynsky: What you see here
is the Three Gorges Dam...
and this is the largest dam by 50%...
uh, ever attempted by man.
Most of the engineers
around the world left the project...
'cause they said, "It's just too big".
Um, in fact, when it did actually fill
with water a year and a half ago...
they were able to measure a wobble
within the Earth as it was spinning.
It took 15 days to fill it.
So, this— this is a massive—
It's created a reservoir
600 kilometers long...
one of the largest reservoirs
ever created.
And it's actually a relief
for what's going on in China...
because, I think,
on the table right now...
there's 27 nuclear power stations
to be built in the next 10 years...
and coal-burning furnaces
are going in there for electric power...
literally weekly.
[Hammering]
Woman On P. A: [Speaking Chinese]
Workers, before you go to the site,
please check that you are wearing
safety equipment or proper clothing.
Please check if
there's any potential danger
and if you are clear about today's work.
Today's highest temperature:
26 to 27 centigrade; lowest: 15 to 16.
Woman: [Speaking Chinese]
- <i>Old Master? How are you?</i>
- Yes.</i>
- <i>Are you working here?</i>
- Yes.</i>
<i>How about the work? Is it hard?</i>
Of course it's hard.
- 20 Yuan.
- <i>What?</i></i>
20, uh, 30 Yuan.
<i>So, 30 Yuan a day? Oh.</i>
Woman: [Chinese Continues]
<i>What do you think of this project?</i></i>
<i>Are you proud of your involvement
on such a huge project?</i>
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
I'm just a general labourer here.
We are just working for our boss,
getting paid here.
We have three shifts a day:
day shift, mid shift and night shift.
Woman: [Speaking Chinese]
<i>How long have you
been working here?</i>
I've been working here nine years.
<i>Nine years? Wow.</i>
It's just work. It's all for our country.
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
The project was officially launched
on December 14, 1994.
It has been almost ten years.
It will take 17 years to finish,
ending in 2009.
This is the biggest dam
that has ever been made in the world
and probably ever will be made.
There are three main functions
of the dam.
The first is to avoid floods.
That's the most crucial function.
The second
is to generate electricity.
The third
is to improve transportation.
That's it.
The full length of the dam
is 2,309 metres.
There will be
26 generators installed...
as well as 6 underground generators,
as back-up, which makes 32 total.
Each one generates 700,000 kW,
with a total capacity of 22,400,000 kW
which supplies 84.7 billion kWh per year.
Woman: [Speaking Chinese]
<i>How many people have to relocate
due to the construction of the dam?</i>
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
According to the statistics
we got in the 1992 census, 830,000,
but considering population growth,
the actual amount is around 1,100,000.
Woman: [Speaking Chinese]
<i>Are these people content
with their new homes?</i>
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
Do not ask me this question.
I'm not in charge of this.
Take a look at that.
Man:
Oh, wow.
Burtynsky: So I made three trips
to the Three Gorges Dam...
looking at that massive transformation
of a landscape.
And it's not— It looks like
a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.
It—What it is— It's a landscape
that is an intentional one.
This is a need for power...
and they're moving 13 full-sized cities
up out of the reservoir...
and flattening all the buildings
so they can make way for the ships.
And it was all the people
who lived in those homes...
were the ones that were actually working
and getting paid, per brick...
to take their cities apart.
<i>Yangtze River Cities,
China, 2002</i>
[Hammering Of Picks]
I want to go back through
to shoot with some different lights.
Man: Yeah, this is spectacular.
Good find, Jeff.
[Crumbling Of Bricks]
Burtynsky: This—This will all be over
in another three weeks or a month.
And it's here for the moment, and once
they're through this rubble, it's finished...
then the water floods it.
So there's this crazy, frenetic activity
for the next month or two...
and then it's gone forever, so—
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Burtynsky:
Well, I think it's all— It'll be okay.
I need that Polaroid.
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
It's a very broad view.
It's hard to see the details.
Burtynsky:
Keep working on the shot.
Woman:
This model has 600 square meters...
in a scale of 1 to 500.
It's the biggest of its kind
in the world...
so it set a Guinness record.
The planning
is from 2001 to 2020...
so 20 years' planning.
Now we also have 50 years' planning.
First we see this blue river
is Huang-p'u River.
Here, this is Huang-p'u River.
And in the eastern side
is called Pudong area.
Pudong area.
The western side is called Puxi area.
Burtynsky:
When Mao finished his reign...
there was 90% agrarian and 10% urban.
Uh, the current idea
coming from Beijing...
is to see it 30% agrarian
and 70% urban...
which, when you look at 1.3 billion—
The urbanization of China...
um, is unprecedented
in the world.
Woman:
...meters, 88 stories...
now the highest building of Shanghai.
This building is under construction.
The name is World Financial Center.
When this building finished...
they will have 492 meters...
101 stories.
In the future, they will become
the highest building of Shanghai.
Here is Century Park.
Century Park.
Behind Century Park, we will see
many white, small buildings.
And here is Villa Garden.
Villa area.
Burtynsky: One of the things I focused on
in terms of the urbanization of China...
was Shanghai, in that Shanghai
is probably China's fastest-growing city.
In the last five years...
it's had about four to five million
new citizens arrive.
And it's growing
in this kind of crazy fashion...
in that thousands and thousands
of high-rise dwellings...
are replacing the older,
traditional dwellings...
that were there.
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
Because our country was poor in the
past, people's life standards were low.
Compared with the old city,
the new city has been improved
regarding the scale
and construction quality.
Generally speaking, life quality
has been improved as well.
Because people feel happy
about the fresh environment.
Woman: So the garden's
about 1,800 square meter.
So I have two gardener
come every day...
to keep these plant all lovely.
Actually, in the evening,
when all this light on the garden...
really look beautiful.
Quiet.
Since I am
in the real estate business...
I visit lots of property...
and...
Shanghai developed really quickly.
Really, I think
the fastest city in the world.
Woman: [Speaking Chinese]
You have so much free time
that you can wash your dog?
[Speaking Chinese]
These houses were
basically old houses.
We were old neighbours.
We've been neighbours for decades.
My father and mother grew up here...
and I was born here.
I'm more than 60 years old now.
Woman:
You see, this open kitchen here...
actually was my garage.
Originally, this house
looked totally different.
[Chiming]
This is the study room.
I spend lots of time here.
This is my favorite bookshelf.
This is antique style.
Chinese antique style.
Red. Red color means happy.
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
Go further. You will find
an interesting place to shoot.
Woman: I think the Shanghai city
is, more or less, for the younger people...
younger generation.
Some older generations,
they are not happy...
because they are feeling their hearts
still belong to the old place.
This is everywhere in the world, same.
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
They came door to door
to persuade you to move, one by one;
sometimes they
deceived people into going.
Sometimes they coaxed them.
Woman: I bought a property,
um, close by here...
called Xi Zhou Hua Cheng.
And they— they could not build
the property which they promised us.
The reason was they needed longer time
to convince old lady, you know...
to— to move just a little bit, maybe...
away from, you know, the area.
Even ten minutes. But she just did not.
It was impossible for her.
Man: [Speaking Chinese]
Often they beat people up.
One guy here got broken bones.
Woman: The whole community
was knocked down but this house.
She just didn't want to leave.
Burtynsky: We are changing
the nature of this planet.
We are changing the air,
we are changing the water...
we are changing the land.
And that's just not China.
That's the world at large.
Burtynsky: There are times
when I have thought about my work...
and putting it into a more
politicized environment.
If I said, "This is a terrible thing
that we're doing to the planet"...
then people will either
agree or disagree.
By not saying what you should see...
that may allow them to look at something
that they never looked at...
and to see their world a little differently.
So I think many people today...
sit in that uncomfortable spot...
where, you know, we don't necessarily
want to give up what we have...
but we realize what we're doing...
is creating problems that run deep.
It's not a simple right or wrong.
It needs a whole new way of thinking.
