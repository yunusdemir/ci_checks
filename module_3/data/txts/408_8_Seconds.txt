Why don't you ride the bulls,
Daddy?
I just ride broncs
bareback, son.
Why?
Tell you the truth,
I'm scared of them.
I ain't scared of them.
Hold on tight.
Grab on, grab on.
Go!
Go, Lane, go! Good ride, son!
- Good ride!
- Good ride, cowboy!
Way to go, boy!
We're at the Ardmore Teen Rodeo,
where champions of tomorrow...
come to the youth rodeo arenas.
This is where our youngsters
learn how to cowboy up.
- Do your best, son.
- Thanks, Clyde.
Find the guts, intestinal
fortitude, and the strength...
- I aim to try, sir.
- Hey, Lane.
...it takes to be champion
in this game.
Right now we're about
to watch Lane Frost.
His daddy Clyde was a five-time
National Finals rodeo qualifier.
- Stay up on your rope.
- Yes, sir.
Reach your feet front.
Don't try to second-guess him.
If you want to ride,
Lane, be the best.
- Yes, sir.
- Bear down.
Sir. OK, boys! OK!
Hold on, Lane!
Get ready for the bulls.
Hey, luck's being
sent in to this kid.
Look at his great control...
and a fabulous
little bull ride...
right here by one of
your very own Oklahoma cowboys.
Lane Frost
made it to the whistle.
The marking's gonna come up
for this young man...
at eighty-six points...
and you are looking
at your champion rider...
of the Ardmore Teen Rodeo.
He cowboy'd up,
and the judges liked it.
Lane Frost
taking what Daddy told him...
and putting it to work.
Nice job, cowboy.
Lane, come on!
You're gonna be late!
Breakfast is ready.
You got time.
Did you get those shirts done?
Will you sit down?
Lane, I saved you
a little money to take.
Mom, I don't need it.
I been chopping wood.
Just in case you get
into trouble.
It's not my first time
to the rodeo.
But it's the first time you've
rodeoed with Tuff Hedeman.
Tuff, slow down.
You're gonna wake me up.
Where is that stupid idiot
pencilneck son of a bitch?
He'll be here.
We're going to have to drive
like hell to get there on time.
That's the way you drive anyway.
Why did I let you
talk me into this?
Because I like him,
and he can share expenses...
and Lane's good.
He ain't that good.
He beat you
at the high school finals.
Hey, he got lucky.
He is a puss.
You know it, and I know it.
Sit down, Lane.
Need you back Monday
or that hay rots.
Yes, sir, I will be.
He was out there
at four thirty this morning.
Nobody ever accused Lane
of avoiding work.
Rodeo ain't a way
to make a living.
Got to be damn good
to make it pay.
That's what I plan on being.
Nice shirt, Lane!
Real pretty.
My mom made it.
You ought to pick up a whole lot
of girls in that shirt.
I might want to borrow it.
Ready?
Just waiting on you, bud.
I bet you wished
you was going with him.
If the shirt don't get girls,
that stupid hat will.
That is an original hat.
Is that a joke?
We don't joke in my family.
We're your family now, buddy.
This here feather in my hat's
my trademark.
That's what we need, Tuff...
a trademark.
I got one. Hard, full of juice,
and barely fits in my jeans.
Jeez, Tuff!
It's my flask, Lane.
Cody, want some OJ?
Lane, didn't think
you'd make it today.
You never rode with Tuff.
Tuff, you drew Bucky Nightmare.
Hang on. He's a rank one.
That's the kind I like.
Our last competitor in
the barrel racing competition...
is Kellie Kyle
from Quanah, Texas.
This lady's already won
over $17,500 this year...
a tremendous performance
this early in the season.
Kellie's no newcomer
to the sport.
She was the National
High School...
Barrel Racing Champion
back in 1980.
She's riding one of
the fastest quarter horses...
on the circuit today...
that great quarter horse
called Crawford.
Kellie Kyle... the time,
seventeen point three.
That's gonna make her our
Amarillo champion barrel racer.
We'll see Kellie at the National
Finals rodeo in December...
as one of our top fifteen
ladies in our world standings.
Let's get ready to go down here
with Lane Frost.
Two years ago, he was
the high school champion...
You're as pretty as my sister,
but don't ride like her.
This bull's prettier
than your sister.
All right.
OK, boys! OK, boys!
It'll be
an automatic disqualification.
His entry fee will be added
to that prize money here.
Eighty-five
is what he's trying to beat.
Lane Frost
with a fine bull ride here.
Look at that young man go!
Lane Frost from Lane, Oklahoma.
He's just lucky.
You get a good bull,
that's half your score.
He stays on and rides.
That's the other half.
Eighty-three.
Good enough to win second.
Just listen to those people
out there.
You've won a whole lot
of rodeo fans.
Hey, lucky boy,
your shirt ain't pretty no more.
You got a little mud
on your feather there.
You hold good.
He's gonna come blowing
out of there hard.
No. He's gonna start spinning
flatter than a pancake.
- He gonna blow.
- He gonna spin.
- He'll blow.
- Spin.
We'll see.
Shut up
and pull my damn rope back.
Make some money, all right?
He gonna blow.
He gonna spin.
- He'll blow.
- Pull me.
He gonna blow.
Gonna spin.
He's just gotta stay
on this bull for eight seconds.
Let's go, boys.
Oh, boy, look at that bull
blow out of there!
Well, good-bye, $65 entry fee.
Let's pay him off anyway.
That was a fine little try.
No score, no money
for Tuff Hedeman.
Ladies and gentlemen...
you can see
that he's very upset about that.
"There's a piece
of little finger...
"on a fence out in Cheyenne.
"They had a wild horse race.
"I thought I'd lend a hand.
"I left bone chips
down in Tucson...
"with a doctor and a nurse.
"Gave blood in Oklahoma
just to help me reimburse.
"In Omaha, Nebraska,
I left a chunk of chin.
"I tried to find it later...
"but forgot where all I'd been."
There you go.
All I'm saying is...
you couldn't bet in
any money standing in the mud.
Told you he blows
out of there, Tuff.
If you had any sense,
pretty boy...
you'd know he was thinking
about spinning...
and just changed his mind,
is all.
I'm glad one of you's thinking.
I don't mean to tell a feller
his business...
but you better keep
a bend in your arm.
Like this?
- Kind of. What's your name?
- Travis.
You want to be a bull rider?
Keep this in mind.
First, stay up on that rope.
Very good. Second thing...
keep your arm real high
and reach out for the front.
Towards the head?
Kind of.
Pretend there's a wall there.
That's the bull's territory.
You don't want to be back there.
Third thing?
Hold on with my feet?
Right. Get a good hold.
Bend your legs.
Toes out, get a foot hold,
chest up, arm out.
You gonna cover him fine.
Let's see ya.
All right. That's good.
Travis, take care.
I got to go.
Thanks. I appreciate it.
Congratulations, Kellie.
Thanks.
You don't remember me, do you?
Lane Frost. We met
at the high school finals.
Sure, Lane. How you doing?
I'm all right.
I don't usually
watch barrel racing...
but you make it look
real interesting.
Well, my horse Crawford
does all the work.
What do you think about getting
a bite to eat real quick?
Oh, I'm with my mom.
Well, your mom's got
to eat, too.
This is my mom Carolyn Kyle.
This is Lane Frost.
Miss Carolyn,
it's certainly a pleasure.
- Quite a ride today.
- Thank you, ma'am.
Did you watch him?
Kellie doesn't like
bull riding much.
Well, it's a little rough.
We was fixing to eat.
I'd appreciate it
if you'd join us.
Lane, let's go, butthole.
Well, I guess I got to go.
Where y'all up next?
Nacogdoches, next weekend.
I'm up at Nacogdoches
next weekend.
Let's eat there.
That sounds good,
doesn't it, honey?
- Sure.
- All right.
Well, y'all take care.
I don't like bull riders.
They're little men
with big egos.
Lane seems kind of different.
He's got a skinny butt
like the rest of them.
I'd judge a man more...
by the size of his heart
than his rear.
It's likely to do you more good.
Come on, Crawford.
Tuff, how you gonna cover
your entry fee in San Angelo?
- Shut up, Cody.
- Shoot, I'd cover you.
I don't want your money, Lane.
I got prize money
and that wood-chopping money.
All right.
I'll pay you back when I win.
I guess I can hold out
that long.
Hey, I make the jokes
in this family, all right?
I just live down the road,
and I got cable.
Oh, darling,
that does sound tempting, but...
it just won't come off.
Well, I did pretty good.
I got second.
Ask him when he's coming home.
I won five hundred dollars.
With a little more trying,
you could've won a thousand.
Yeah, you're right.
Who do you think's
had the most wrecks?
Charlie Sampson, you know that.
Busted his ankle, his wrist...
his sternum,
and his leg a time or two.
Punctured his lungs, too.
- Who you talking about?
- Charlie Sampson.
I seen him bust his head.
At Cow Palace,
got his ear ripped off.
- He never broke his nose.
- Why not?
Just lucky, I reckon.
Hey, you boys kicked ass today.
I wanna buy you all a drink.
- You're a gentleman.
- I'll have a Coke.
I ain't buying nobody no Coke.
I don't want anything, then.
I said I'm buying you a drink.
Buy him what he wants, fat boy.
I don't give a shit
what he wants.
You fat-ass,
low-life shit-for-brains!
Come on, shit-for-brains!
You're a bronc rider, ain't you?
That's right.
What's your name?
Shithead!
- John.
- That's a great name.
Lane Frost.
How the heck are you?
What the hell's Lane doing,
running for mayor?
He's probably running
for dog catcher.
Let's shoot a game of pool.
So when did your daddy
quit rodeo?
I guess about 1968.
Decided he was gonna
stay home on the ranch.
Before that,
top fifteen cowboys...
year in and year out.
I'm dancing with her, all right?
Get your hands off my girl!
Come on!
Wait!
Come on, come on!
Out the door! Come on!
Outside, let's go!
Get him, Lane! Come on!
I got to piss!
Get him in the car, Lane.
You try gettin' him in the car!
No shit, Lane,
I gotta take a piss!
You better run!
You didn't even have a drink
tonight, did you, Lane?
You didn't even have a beer.
I don't drink a whole lot.
Can't be a cowboy
and a nice guy, Lane.
It don't work like that.
We got an image to uphold.
Drinking, loving,
fighting cowboys.
Tuff thinks he's John Wayne.
You're damn right.
We're a tradition...
last of a dying breed.
Maybe there's a reason
for that dying part.
Shit. These two-bit rodeos
don't mean nothing.
Win a couple hundred
here and there.
It's all bullshit.
Cheyenne, Houston, Del Rio...
that's where the big money is.
That's where the real cowboys
are gonna be...
and, pretty boy, where you'll
get your skinny ass kicked.
How's come?
'Cause you ain't got
what it takes.
You ain't goddamn good enough.
You're a puss.
Dream about that.
When Tuff's being mean
and hateful like that...
your best bet's
just to ignore him.
He's gonna be his normal
sweet self in the morning.
Lord, I love this.
Tuff, you wet the bed!
Urine ain't something
that can be played with.
You can't ride a bull
with no diaper rash.
Cody, how you put up
with him peeing in the bed?
Well, you get used to it.
Well, I don't want
to get used to it.
Lane Frost on Panda Bear
here at Nacogdoches, Texas.
What a gutsy ride here
by Lane Frost.
Fifteen to two thousand pounds
of animal.
Look at Lane Frost
getting some money time.
Gonna be a money ride here
this afternoon for Lane Frost!
The best bull rider today.
Nice ride today, Lane.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.
- You betcha.
So, are we gonna go
get something to eat?
What?
Remember Amarillo?
We said we'd get us
a bite to eat.
Lane, I forgot. I'm sorry.
I made other plans.
Well, heck, I been planning this
for a whole week.
I'm really sorry.
Your mom can come with us
if you want.
Well...
I don't rodeo full-time.
I'm in college.
What for?
It's a sports medicine program.
I love helping people,
and I love rodeo...
so it's a way
to put them both together.
I got so many plans.
I don't know how
I'm gonna get them all done.
Them plans
include riding a bull?
Not hardly.
Don't you ever worry
about getting injured?
I'm holding together
better than they thought.
They say it's not
if you get hurt riding bulls.
It's how bad.
Heck, them bulls
ain't got nothing against you.
They just want to buck you off
and get on with their business.
People hurt you a lot sooner.
What do you mean?
Nothing. It don't matter.
I saw you talking to that kid
last week at the rodeo.
Nobody else does that.
I remember
when I was a little kid...
my dad took me
to this rodeo in Utah.
It was the first time I got
to sneak behind the chutes...
and see all them cowboys.
I got back there...
they didn't want nothing
to do with me...
so I said right there...
if I ever get here,
I'm talking to everybody.
Them little kids
need somebody to look up to.
I look up to my dad.
Some kids don't got that.
If I can be that for them,
that's part of the job.
Rodeo's not
just about making money.
It's about being your best...
and helping others
be their best.
This is something
I've dreamed about...
ever since I was little,
and now I'm living the dream.
How's your What-A-Chicken?
It's fine.
Good.
Barrel racing's
more than just riding.
When I'm running Crawford,
it's like I'm part of him.
I got to give him all my trust.
Bull riding
ain't all that different.
I got a lot of respect
for them bulls.
When one comes busting
out of that gate...
it's like
you're tied onto a tornado.
You're not trying
to break his spirit...
you're just trying to stay
with him jump for jump.
It's like every wild
and free thing in the world...
is right there
in the palm of your hand.
Probably sounds
pretty stupid to you.
No, that's not stupid.
I know what you mean.
I'm real glad
you remembered about dinner.
I wouldn't forget
something like that.
I'm riding in Lubbock
next weekend.
We're up in Lubbock.
I guess we'll see you there.
Yeah, I hope so.
Thanks for dinner.
No. That's my pleasure, really.
Well...
Good night, Lane.
You sure been seeing a lot
of Kellie the last few months.
She was upset
last time you got together.
What are you talking about?
I heard you stayed on
eight seconds...
then jumped off
and threw your hat in the air!
I'll just be a minute.
Better hope Tuff doesn't wake up
and find out we're in Texas.
We're just passing through.
Thought I'd stop by.
I'm glad you did.
Good.
Where'd y'all come from?
California.
Where you headed?
We going to Nebraska.
Lane, Texas isn't on the way
from California to Nebraska.
Well, I never did have much
of a sense of direction.
You got real pretty land
here, Kellie.
Thanks.
Sure would like to have me
something like this someday.
Of course, I just grew up
on a little ranch.
Lane, that doesn't matter to me.
We're just country people.
Country people
are the best kind...
hardworking,
down to earth, sincere.
How about if they ride bulls?
Guess everybody's
a little peculiar.
Where are we now?
Quanah, Texas...
home of Kellie Kyle.
What did you say?
You heard me.
There are girls
all over the rodeo.
- Isn't that right, Cleatis?
- Yeah, there are.
Why in the hell do we have
to detour five hundred miles...
just for this one?
Love knows no boundaries.
A puss in love.
It's pitiful.
You know, Kellie...
Del Rio's the first real big
bull ride of the year.
I'd be plumb tickled
if you'd watch me.
I'd love to, Lane,
but I got finals.
Heck, that ain't no problem.
Study during them other events
and look up when I come on.
I'll think about it.
I expect I'd best go.
Y'all want to stay for supper?
We got plenty.
No. We really should go.
Thanks for stopping by.
You got you
a heck of a place here.
Yes, sir.
Be about perfect
for the wedding.
What wedding?
Yours and mine.
I'm glad you told me.
I'll try to keep the day open.
Lane, you never even kissed me.
Well, what did you expect
from an Okie...
that can't get
from California to Nebraska?
I don't chew tobacco or nothin'.
Check this out. Erwin Williams...
Tulsa, Oklahoma.
The bull is White Lightning.
Stay with him, Erwin.
He's got a good seat.
It looks like
he's gonna make it.
He did!
This is it, boys...
big time, big money.
Seventy-nine points!
A seventy-nine!
Tuff, look over there.
That's Gary LaFew, man!
We're bull riding
with the World Champ!
That's what they'll
be saying about us someday.
"Ain't that Lane Frost?
"And look over there.
There's Tuff Hedeman.
"I did not know he was
such a handsome son of a gun."
Did you see that, Cody?
He actually got a joke.
Lane Frost
has a sense of humor.
He ain't as dumb as I thought.
I can't be that dumb, boys.
Doing what I love.
Hey, there's Red Rock!
Casey Canby on Red Rock.
That makes 250 victims
that Red Rock's got.
That boy only lasted
about four seconds.
I'd give anything
for a chance at Red Rock.
Forget about him.
Think about Savage Seven,
'cause you're up.
...Coming into chute
number three.
Riding him will be
Lane Frost from Oklahoma.
OK, boys! OK, boys!
Stay with him, Lane Frost!
Here's another one riding
for the championship.
Stay with him!
Don't you dare give up, son.
Bull turning to the left
and right again.
So far with a pretty good seat.
Everything looking good
for Lane Frost.
There's
the eight-second whistle.
No score for Lane Frost.
Lane needs
a magnificent ride tomorrow...
to be eligible
for that prize money.
Soon as we get his condition
from our paramedics...
Lay back.
It's OK. I'm with Lane.
- You can't go in right now.
- Please, sir.
You'll have to wait outside.
Is my dick still there?
It's hanging by a thread.
- Don't look.
- You don't want to see it.
Cody, is he all right?
He's going to be fine, now.
He won't be a romantic buckaroo
for a while...
but he's going to be fine.
You don't have to babysit me.
I think I'm going
to stick around...
and see how far them balls
swell up, see if they pop.
Biggest money ride so far
this year, and I fall off.
Maybe my dad's right.
I could rodeo my whole life...
end up worse off
than when I started.
You could.
I seen old cowboys.
Rodeo beat 'em up so bad...
they can't hardly get out
the bed come morning.
I don't want that.
Well, maybe you ought
to just quit, Lane.
Go home,
work your daddy's ranch...
live to be a hundred...
sit in your rocking chair
and watch the sun go down.
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?
Real special.
Did you hear me say anything
about quitting?
Just before you croak...
one last thought's
going to keep going through...
that pretty little head of yours
over and over again...
I'm a puss.
I was the best goddamn
bull rider in the circuit...
and I chickened out.
Hell, the best?
You always tell me
I ain't no good.
If you believe everything
you hear, God damn it...
you're dumber
than I thought, Lane!
Quit.
That'd be fine with me.
I wouldn't have to wake up
every goddamn morning...
to your pretty-boy face.
Me and Cody would get
down the road faster...
if we didn't have to wait
for you signing autographs...
for every snot-nose little kid
at every goddamn rodeo!
All right.
I got two words to say to you.
Yeah, I know. Just...
That ain't it.
What is it?
Cowboy up.
You're a puss.
Lane Frost,
who got banged up yesterday...
Mind your business.
You got the guts.
Now comes the glory.
Go, Lane!
All right, now.
The bull they call
Double Trouble.
OK, boys! OK, boys!
Look at that kid ride!
Just picture perfect.
This guy's not making
one bumble at all!
Lane, come on!
Look at this rider.
This young man's on.
Look at Lane Frost go
on Double Trouble!
Lane, stay right there on him!
You're right there!
You see that?
Way to go, Lane!
Lane Frost... a textbook ride
by the Oklahoma cowboy.
I'm told by judges we got
a forty-five margin on one side.
Forty-five on the other.
Ninety points for Lane Frost!
Ninety points on that ride.
There's a guy
the doctors suggested...
ought to stay in bed...
comes out and turns in
a ninety-point ride.
I thought he was going
to try the right.
Don't second-guess a bull.
He could've throwed you
out the back door.
Look, your weight's
all on the wrong leg.
Must've done something right.
I got second place.
You just lucky
the other boys rode so poor.
There's a guy
the doctors suggested...
ought to stay in bed...
comes out here and turns in
a ninety-point ride.
I thought you was up
helping my mama.
Lane, what's wrong?
Nothing. I'm fine.
Your mom's great.
I've never been brought home
to meet the folks before.
She made me feel right at home.
I haven't had a chance
to visit with your dad yet.
He's great.
If I do half
what he's done in his life...
I'll be doing good.
He's kept this ranch going
with no money.
Ain't like your family, Kellie.
My daddy ain't no president
of a bank.
Everything we got
he worked for.
Gets up at five every morning...
don't stop till
after dark every day.
You want to talk about
what's bothering you?
Nothing's bothering me!
I'm fine, I told you.
But if you ever need to talk
about anything, talk to me?
Nothing you could say or do
would make you less in my eyes.
I love you.
You don't have to be
perfect for me.
You mean that?
You may have to prove it.
I will.
Right now
I'm covered in horseshit.
You're a great dancer.
Sorry I'm so surprised.
I took a couple of lessons...
'cause I knowed
you was looking forward to it.
Whatever it is, Kellie...
I'll always do my best for you.
I'll do my best for you,
too, Lane.
If I ever mess up...
you just take
an old frying pan to my head.
I'll sic Red Rock on you.
He'll take care of you.
Mrs. Frost,
would you care to dance?
No, thank you, Cody.
But thanks for asking.
It'd be my pleasure.
I appreciate it.
What are you thinking about?
Denver.
Draw me some good bulls there,
I might get a check.
Lane, maybe I should quit school
for a while.
If you're traveling
all the time...
we'll never see each other.
I can always finish later.
Whatever you want.
We could rodeo together.
Be together all the time.
What about Tuff and Cody?
There's lots of guys
who can buddy with them.
You are a prettier sight
to wake up to in the morning...
than Tuff Hedeman,
and that's for sure.
I don't want to be away
from you for one minute.
I don't know how I'm going to be
at this husband stuff.
You'll be fine.
I guess it's like bull riding.
Just get on and hope
you don't get bucked off.
Thanks a lot.
Tuff Hedeman...
Twisted toros in the Arizona
dirt this Christmas season.
Hey, taking a bull
down here today.
This cowboy
needs the Christmas cash...
and he's taking the kind of ride
that paychecks are made out of.
Good enough to win first place.
Tuff Hedeman and Cody Lambert
take home first and second.
You've won $36,000 so far
in 1985.
What's the biggest reason
you're competing professionally?
I suppose mostly it's the money.
That's how we make our living...
Cody and I win,
Lane gets bucked off...
and they still want
to talk to him.
Go figure.
Buy you a beer, Tuff?
Buy you one, Kel.
Come on.
If they say there's one
that can't be rid...
that's the one I want.
Y'all can stay with us
whenever you want.
Just treat me
like one of the boys.
You might regret that.
I've been around rodeo
my whole life.
You ain't been in the bathroom
after five bull riders.
Don't worry. I'm pretty tough.
I thought I was Tuff.
Two beers.
I.D.?
Gotcha.
How'd you get the name Tuff?
When I was four years old...
I got my hand slammed
in the car door.
Never did cry or nothing.
So they started
calling me Tough Nut.
It got shortened.
What's your real name?
Richard.
He's pretty special to me,
Richard.
He does grow on you.
Smiley pecker.
They act like he hung the moon.
Honey?
You asleep?
Good morning, Kellie.
Motels was all full.
Lane said it'd be OK
to bunk in with y'all.
Well, how'd you sleep, Tuff?
Like an angel.
Me, too.
Morning, Kellie.
How you doing?
Great.
Just great.
What about getting
our own place?
I think it's a good idea
if you got the money.
My daddy will lend us the money.
His friend in real estate
can get us a good deal.
How's it going to be ours
if he buys it?
You want a place?
I'll get you a place.
I want to live near my folks,
since you'll be gone so much.
Whatever you want.
OK. Drive careful.
What's that?
That's exactly what you wanted...
a place close to your parents.
You are just going to love it.
I bought this
off that singer Ray Raymond.
You paid money for this?
I got him down
to almost nothing.
It's only $600.
Can you believe that?
Lane, it's the ugliest thing
I've ever seen.
Got great ventilation.
We can keep the TV
and all them eight-tracks.
Right here, Elvis Presley
once had a beer in our kitchen.
Lately?
No, I think
it was sometime back...
but it's real homey.
Here is the bath suite, complete
with shower and curtain.
That was generous.
Lane, I can't live here.
It'll give me nightmares.
Now, honey, a couple days...
you'll be calling it
home sweet home.
I don't think so.
Look. Double closets.
Let's just put it
in the back, honey.
Let's put it up front,
then the ice cream don't melt.
Let's just put
the ice cream up there.
This way we know
where it's at when we get home.
We got more room in back.
What's this?
That is for later.
You mean it's for me?
No, I mean it's for later.
It ain't my birthday
or anything.
No. It ain't your birthday.
It's our anniversary, isn't it?
Shoot, honey, I forgot.
Just keep looking in the box.
Oh, Kel.
Fifth in the world.
It's time
you started dressing like it.
You always looking out for me,
ain't you?
Somebody's got to.
I love you, honey.
I love you, too.
I got another surprise for you
at home.
It's something for me to wear.
For the next ten days...
each cowboy
will ride one bull a day...
and the winner will be
our World's Champion.
Lane Frost... good bull here
he's got today...
Mission lmpossible.
He's awful hard to handle
in this first round...
Lane Frost wants to be
the World's Champion bull rider.
All he's got to do is beat
eighty-one-point scores.
Eighty-one is what
he's got to beat.
He's there for the whistle.
Let's check the judges.
Eighty-five points!
Eighty-five puts him in first
place for the first round.
After seven days,
Lane Frost is the only cowboy...
to ride all seven head.
This is bull number eight.
He's trying to break
a world record...
being the first man
to ride all ten bulls...
at the National Finals.
Lane Frost
is going for a new record.
He did it!
Ladies and gentlemen,
eight in a row... Lane Frost.
On the verge
of a World's Championship...
you've won 83,000 so far
this year...
you're in first place
ahead of fifteen competitors.
This first world's title
will be easy, right?
Well, I don't think
it's ever easy, George.
When you got bull riders
like Cody Lambert...
and Jim Sharp...
Jim's riding good this year...
it's going to be tough,
but I'm tickled to be here.
Me and my traveling partner
Tuff Hedeman...
been trading places all year.
Sometimes he's in first,
next week I'm in first.
If he wins,
I'll be so happy for him...
I'll forget about myself losing.
Lane Frost...
great bull rider, terrible liar.
You're not going
to be happy for him.
Sure I would.
He's luckier than I am.
After nine days, Lane Frost
is still in first place.
If he gets eighty-six points
or higher...
nobody else can catch him
here in the competition.
He's on that bull Misfit.
Many cowboys have had
a tough time with this bull...
but look how easily Lane
seems to be handling it.
I've never seen anyone ride...
Tell me.
He's trying for nine in a row.
He's there
for the eight-second whistle!
We're going
to get Lane's score...
He's hung up,
ladies and gentlemen!
His hand is hung up
in that rope...
He's underneath the bull!
Lane Frost
is underneath the bull!
Our bullfighters get him off,
ladies and gentlemen.
They got him away.
Lane Frost
is free from that bull.
Look at that score
coming up for Lane Frost.
An eighty-seven-point marking!
Your new World's Champion
bull rider...
Lane Frost from Quanah, Texas.
Lane Frost has already
won the World's Championship...
but he's got
one more bull to ride.
If he rides that bull...
he will become
the first man in history...
to ride all ten bulls
at the National Finals rodeo...
but he has drawn Red Rock.
This bull has bucked off
over three hundred cowboys.
This could be a moment
that rodeo will never forget.
That's hard luck...
you drawing Red Rock
on your last bull.
I don't care when I draw him.
We've been waiting for this
for a long time, ain't we?
OK, boys. OK!
Lane Frost...
World's Champion bull rider...
on a bull that has never
been ridden... Red Rock.
Look at the strength
this animal has.
Lane is truly showing...
his World's Championship
style of bull riding.
He could be the first cowboy
to ride all ten bulls...
at the National Finals rodeo.
Look at them go! Lane Frost!
He's not there
for the eight-second whistle!
That makes him victim
three hundred and five.
I think Red Rock ought to be
getting this award instead...
but since y'all put
my name on it so nice...
I guess I'll keep it.
This is the biggest dream
of my life.
Heck, it's the biggest dream
of any cowboy's life.
Now that I'm the World Champ...
I'll do my best
for all the fans there.
Well, I just want
to thank everybody...
that stood behind me
on the way up.
Thank you very much.
Today's the day
I'm gonna make it...
Well, these are
so much bigger today.
That's something.
It took a lot of try
to win this, son.
It's real nice.
I felt like I was hanging on
by a fingernail a time or two.
No, you rode real good.
Of course, now the job
is staying on top.
That's when we find out
if you're a real champion.
Is anything wrong?
Why?
I never seen you
having more than one beer.
Well, ain't I entitled?
Of course.
I'm the World's Champ now.
Don't that count
for something with you?
Congratulations, Lane.
You did a hell of a job.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate that.
Congratulations, Lane.
There he is,
politicking again.
They act like he hung the moon.
Hello, Kellie.
How have you been?
Hello, Martin. How are you?
Good.
Hey, congratulations for Lane.
Thank you.
You did real well in the roping.
Yeah. I won another buckle.
If you want to go meet
Tuff and Cody, it's all right.
I just have to get
out of these shoes.
Can you help me with these?
I'll be glad to get home.
Two weeks in Vegas
is too long for me.
Nobody made you come.
I wanted to see you ride.
That's crap.
You hate bull riding.
Calf roping's more your style.
That's why you was talking
to Martin Hudson.
You was with him once.
Maybe you ain't got it
out of your system.
That was way before
we got together.
So why was you talking
to him tonight?
I had to talk to somebody.
I don't want that jerk
anywheres near you.
Everybody knows
you done slept with him.
Nobody knows.
Lane, what's wrong?
I'm the World Champion now.
People are looking at me.
I want them thinking
we got a great marriage.
I thought we did.
Tonight at the National
Finals rodeo...
World Champions were crowned.
Among them, the popular
bull rider Lane Frost...
who won
his first National title.
Here's a comment
from Frost's acceptance speech.
This is the biggest dream
of my life.
Heck, it's the biggest dream
of any cowboy's life.
Now that I'm the World Champ...
I'll do my best
for all the fans there.
I just want
to thank everybody...
who stood behind me
on the way up.
Thank you very much.
I'm sorry, Kel.
I didn't mean
to take it out on you.
I got all these people
looking at me...
and expecting so much.
Don't want to let them down.
You won't, Lane.
But you got to help me.
I will, honey.
I don't know why you put up
with me half the time.
Real proud of you, Lane.
You, too, Kellie.
How about it, everybody?
Lane Frost,
World Champion bull rider...
here at Northstar Dodge.
Lane, Kellie meeting us
to promote that hat deal?
No. She's staying with her mom.
Got my Lane Frost underwear.
Got my Lane Frost lunchbox.
They coming out with boots
with your name?
They're calling them
Puss 'n' Boots.
I'll be heading out now.
There's plenty of my shirts
and hats left to buy.
I do appreciate you stopping by.
Come on, Lane.
It's still early.
We ain't even had a dance yet.
Pretty boys
need their sleep, too.
Come on, Lane.
Just one more picture.
Hey, darling...
Sorry I had to leave you
this message...
but I waited as long as I could.
Mom and me
had to get started for Tulsa.
I wish I could have talked
to you, honey.
I love you. Bye.
Shoot, I thought you was there.
I wish you was there.
I just got back.
I had one of them promotional
deals after the rodeo...
and they just wouldn't
let me go.
All that stuff.
Well, we're gonna go
to a few more rodeos...
so I guess I won't be home
till Friday night.
If you get this,
leave me a number.
I'll call you there in Tulsa
in the morning.
Wish you was home.
If not, I'll...
Well, you know, I'll call you
tomorrow night, OK?
Good luck with your horse
and everything.
I love you.
Good night.
I thought you might want
a nightcap.
We don't even have to go out.
You know, I don't drink much.
Yeah, OK.
Well, then, maybe
you can sign this for my nephew.
He's a real fan of yours.
OK, sure.
It's not usually so cold
in Prescott...
this time of year.
All right...
come on in a sec.
You don't think anything's
happened to him, do you?
I think one of them buckle
bunnies from last night...
was looking to happen to him
in a big way.
Listen to this one.
It's called "Waitin' On Lane."
"We've been waitin' on Lane
ever since we recall.
"We started in April,
and it's comin' on Fall.
"We have us a bite,
we have us a chew...
"we get us some shuteye,
we have us a brew.
"Someone's takin' his picture,
someone's wanting a loan.
"He's kissin' the babies,
or he's on the damn phone.
"But we'll keep on waitin',
though we ain't pleased...
"'cause the World Champion
bull rider's got the van keys."
You're damn right.
I like that one.
I hope he didn't get
any of them crotch critters.
How's your dog, Nelson?
It ain't like that.
I run into an uncle of mine.
Got a place outside of town.
It got too late.
He couldn't drive me back.
Wish I had me
an uncle like that...
put me up whenever
I come to town, feed me...
then plant one of them...
big ol' greasy hickeys
on my neck.
Get in the van.
And then you drove
from Scottsdale to Prescott.
What happened there?
Tuff and Cody got checked,
and I fell off.
Then you drove to Laramie?
We stayed there...
drove back the next day.
I missed you.
I'm a little sore.
- Sorry.
- You're hurt?
It's just the usual.
I'm glad you're home.
I just wish
it was gonna be longer.
That night in Prescott...
What?
Too stupid to tell you.
It's just something Tuff did.
I'll tell you
when I don't hurt so much.
Night.
Good night.
I want to thank you folks
for coming here today...
on such short notice.
Red Rock and I and Lane
have an important announcement.
Lane's going
to try the impossible...
to ride the unrideable bull
Red Rock.
Red Rock hasn't been ridden
in 309 tries...
by the world's toughest
bull riders, including Lane.
Lane will get three chances.
The first one, April 17th,
right here in Seguin, Texas.
If Lane succeeds, he'll write
his own page in rodeo history.
I'm sure you folks
have questions.
We'll be glad to answer them.
Get something now, champ.
No, thanks.
Appreciate it, though.
I watched you ride
since I was a kid.
I wanted to give you
something back.
I got a spot for this.
Thank you.
Lane, why didn't you
tell me about this?
You said we were coming
for a shirt promotion.
I just wanted it
to be a surprise.
We're partners, Lane.
What do you think
I'm doing this for?
We got money, Lane.
The boy there,
he used to be World Champion.
Now he's got his hand out.
I don't want that for us.
You'll never be like that.
I know.
Red Rock's my guarantee.
Your guarantee is us.
Of course it is.
What do you think
I'm doing this for?
'Cause you like
all the attention.
So you don't have
to be alone with me.
This is the most important day
of my life.
I got to go talk to them.
You coming?
Not hardly.
We've wanted to add on,
but we never had enough money.
It's going to be great.
The corral he's building for us
is going to be right up there.
Lane's been so good to us.
I don't know
where he gets his energy.
I've never seen him relax.
We didn't even have a honeymoon.
We did.
Clyde didn't talk to me
for the first three days.
On your honeymoon?
Finally I went to him, said...
"Clyde, what is wrong?
What have I done?"
You know what he said?
"They ruined my boots."
His boots?
Yeah. On his wedding day...
some of his friends threw him
into the water trough.
It was just a joke,
but he worried and brooded.
It's funny now.
I see a lot of Clyde in Lane,
but he's a good man.
I couldn't have asked
for better.
Tuff, why didn't you tell me
we was driving?
Told Kellie
we'd fly out tomorrow.
Tomorrow flight's all full.
Sorry, Kel.
Lane, it's all right.
It ain't.
She drove all the way here.
I got to see you ride.
You need
some clean clothes anyway.
Give me your dirty things.
If Spanish Fork wasn't
big money, I'd stay with you.
Don't worry about it.
At least I got to see you.
- I'll call you.
- I love you.
I just drove up to see Lane.
Figure a World Champion could
get somebody to do his laundry.
I don't mind.
That way it's done right.
You want to get some dinner?
Thanks, but I should go.
I got things to do.
Lane's gone so much,
it's hard to keep up.
I'll get back by eleven.
Good to see you.
It's good seeing you,
too, Kellie.
Can I change my mind?
He gets up at six every morning
and jump ropes or runs...
then works in the barn.
At night he watches his tapes
to improve.
That's on his day off.
You've changed so much.
Changed? How?
I remember the first time
I ever saw you ride.
It was up to Ardmore
about five years ago...
right before
we started going out.
I could see how much
you loved it...
how much pride
you had in racing...
in beating your own time.
I've been riding
my whole life...
and I remember
I was envious of the way...
that you handled that horse.
His name was Crawford,
wasn't it?
He's hurt, but I'm training
another horse.
Nothing's different.
It is different.
You're living for Lane.
It's all about Lane now.
I want to help him.
Even drive 400 miles
to pick up his dirty laundry?
If that's what he wants.
Would he do
the same thing for you?
Yes, he would.
It's not about him or me.
It's him and me.
We're in this together.
I don't see anybody asking you
for your autograph.
I don't need that.
Or giving you gold belt buckles.
He deserves it, Martin.
He's better than me.
That's where you're wrong.
We should get the check.
You're still beautiful.
That hasn't changed.
Hello, darling.
Hi, Lane.
I'm so glad you're home.
I'll get it.
It's probably for me.
Oh, hey, Tuff.
I don't think I can make that.
I got that Red Rock deal
in Seguin on the seventeenth.
I don't know.
I'm not crazy about them.
Well, 'cause they crash
all the time, that's why.
All right. Check it out.
All right. Yep.
Thanks.
Lane, there's something
I have to tell you.
Tuff wants to buy
a little plane.
Says it will cut down
on the driving around.
Something happened.
I didn't want it to...
but it just did.
Lane, are you listening?
Yeah. Just a second.
Lane, listen to me.
I'm listening.
I've been seeing somebody else.
I mean, I saw somebody else.
It was just once.
It's never
going to happen again.
Who was it?
I can't explain it, Lane.
I know it was wrong.
Who was it?
Martin Hudson.
How many other guys
you been with, Kel?
None.
I'm supposed to believe that?
How do I know what
you're doing here...
when I'm on the road?
I've been here, Lane.
Every time I called you...
all I got was
that damn answering machine.
- I'm always here, Lane.
- What did I tell you?
I told you
to stay away from him!
I know.
Probably gone and told
all his pussy roping friends.
He wouldn't do that.
Yes, he would, Kel!
We promised
we'd take care of each other.
We said we'd do the best
we could by each other.
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?
So why'd you do it?
I wanted you,
but you weren't there.
I've been out there
busting my ass...
trying to give you
everything you want.
We live in a trailer.
You remodeled your dad's place.
Even built him corrals.
You can't buy his love.
You get out.
Lane, I'm sorry.
Get out.
I thought I could trust you!
Don't let this ruin everything.
Get out!
Lane, I love you.
Lane, is Kellie going
to see you ride Red Rock?
I'm not sure.
- She riding next week?
- Maybe.
Oh, boy, look at this,
ladies and gentlemen.
Check out the power
and strength of Red Rock.
He's turning back
into Lane's hand.
Look at this
World Champion bull ride.
Gosh, he's off.
He wasn't there
for the eight-second whistle.
A no-score.
Red Rock wins again.
Now, folks,
that makes 310 cowboys...
that have tried
to ride Red Rock.
Even the World's Champion
couldn't do that.
I remind you,
he has two more chances...
to try and ride
that bull Red Rock.
Ladies and gentlemen...
something must be wrong
with Lane Frost.
I've known this great cowboy
for better than five years.
I've never, ever seen him
get bucked off...
with a bull
that turned back into his hand.
What happened to you and Kellie?
Nothing.
You seen my boots?
Why did you move home instead
of living with your wife?
Dad needs a little help
right now.
Who are all those girls
calling at all hours?
Probably just fans.
Maybe we ought to get
an unlisted number.
Look at me and tell me
you're not seeing other girls.
Can't find nothing
in this house.
Why won't you look at me?
I'm looking at you.
You've been cheating on Kellie,
haven't you?
- Where's my spurs?
- On the table. Answer me.
I haven't done anything
she hasn't done, OK?
I can't let you throw away...
the best thing that has
ever happened to you!
What do you want?
I want the truth.
Other girls
didn't expect nothing from me.
That's what I need.
You don't know what you need.
She told me
she'd been with another man.
What do I say to that?
You'll just have to forgive her.
How come I always have
to be perfect?
Nobody is asking you
to be perfect.
Dad does!
I could win the world
a hundred times over.
It wouldn't matter to him.
It matters more to him
than anything in this world.
Then why can't he say something?
You know I'd give it all back...
if one time, he could say...
say...
It's killing me.
I want you to look at
these awards of your father's.
I want you to tell me
what do you see here?
I don't know.
Dust.
They get tarnished.
Sure, we're proud of them,
but 1963, '64...
that was a long time ago.
Hold on to the things that last.
Kellie loves you,
and I know that you love her.
She won't take me back.
Why don't you let her decide?
You still seeing that guy?
- I'm going to hang up now.
- Please.
Lane, I can't be treated
the way you treat me any longer.
I don't mind taking care
of things for you...
the bills, your clothes,
having your friends stay over.
I want to help you...
but I won't give up everything
and get nothing back.
It's not enough for me anymore.
- Bye, Lane.
- I miss you.
Round two...
Lane Frost versus Red Rock.
Lane Frost got his hand
hung up in that rope.
The bullfighters coming in...
trying to get that rope
out of Lane's hand.
He's hung up.
Fifteen hundred pounds,
bucking hard.
Red Rock is tossing him.
The bullfighters having
a tremendous, difficult job...
trying to get his hand
out of there.
The other bull riders...
are trying to get him
away from that bull!
He's taking a pounding,
ladies and gentlemen...
but he's the World Champion.
He can handle it.
I can see he is conscious.
He is conscious.
He is taking some air.
He's getting his first aid...
You got to breathe.
Get a doctor!
It's Tuff. Listen to me, now.
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Shoot, Dad,
it ain't just Red Rock.
I been having
a heck of a time lately.
Tore my shoulder out.
Pulled the hell out of my groin.
I ain't even in the top fifteen.
I went through
a lot of dry spells.
Got a tape of me and Red Rock
up at the house.
Thought maybe you'd look at it,
tell me what I'm doing wrong.
There ain't nothing
I can tell you...
about bull riding
you don't know.
I was...
hard on you at first 'cause...
I knew you had it in you
to be the best, and...
Well...
I guess I just...
hate seeing anything good
go to waste.
You never ride again...
it won't matter to me.
You proved yourself.
I don't say
what I feel very much...
but I hope you know that...
Let's go up to the house,
look at that tape.
I can probably
find something to pick on.
How's the neck?
It's holding my head on.
You ever think
you're gonna get Red Rock rode?
What's the point?
Point?
Kellie ain't there,
I don't see much point.
You're starting to sound
like a damn country song.
So what would you do?
I'd stop wasting my time.
She said it was over.
I've never known Kellie to lie.
You blew it, Lane.
Might as well lick your wounds
and learn to live with it...
'cause the prettiest thing
you'll be waking up to is me.
Cowboy up.
Kellie, please,
I'll watch this horse.
Brandon, stop bothering her.
Sorry, you guys.
I've had something
to say to you for a long time.
I didn't want to hurt you.
I wouldn't do it for nothing
in the world.
- You don't have to tell me.
- I do.
I got to say it for myself.
I've been with other girls.
I ain't got no excuses.
Ain't your fault.
You done the best you could
by me, and I failed you.
We've both made mistakes, Lane.
When you told me,
I wasn't even mad at you.
All them things I said,
I should've said to myself.
I'm sorry, Kel.
I love you, Kel.
I don't want it anymore.
I want to spend my time
with you...
wake up with you
in a real house...
and know I don't gotta go
somewhere to a damn rodeo.
That's what I want, too, Lane.
I'll make it up to you, Kel.
I love you.
Every eye is on this young man.
This is his third and final try
at riding Red Rock...
now a bull
that's bucked off 311 cowboys.
Bear down there, Lane.
This is truly
a challenge of the champions.
This'll put you over the top.
OK, boys! OK, boys!
Will this be the first man
in rodeo history...
ever to ride Red Rock?
Go, Lane!
Look at this bull!
I've never seen an animal
try in more ways...
to get his rider off!
There he goes!
Can Lane Frost stay with him?
Got him!
You've got the bull ride...
you wanted to see in here
this afternoon!
He did it!
Lane Frost is the first man
to ride Red Rock to the whistle!
Not since Freckles Brown
rode Tornado...
in 1967 has there been a ride
to match this!
Lane, you just won
your own page in rodeo history!
I ain't been on a bull
since April.
Everybody's expecting me
up to Cheyenne.
Tuff's fixing to get a plane.
Maybe I'll drive up there
and meet you.
They got a nice hotel.
Maybe we could get us
one of them suites...
with the big bubbling tub
and king-size bed.
How many cowboys are going to be
sleeping with us?
Just Tuff and Cody.
Of course,
they're family, you know.
Breeze feels nice, doesn't it?
Just a little further
on up here.
Never ridden a horse
with a blindfold before.
Hang on.
OK, just a little further.
It's beautiful.
I'm gonna build your corrals
right up there.
On top of the hill there...
I'm gonna put me
some bucket chutes...
so I can have
a bull riding school.
Over here, I'll build you
a great big house.
Lots of kids running around.
Right over here,
I'm gonna put that trailer...
with the big guitar on it.
You're kidding, aren't you?
No, I ain't kidding. Wouldn't
seem like home otherwise.
Please tell me
you're making a joke, Lane.
Yes, darling,
I'm making a joke.
I'm gonna put it right over
there next to your corrals.
Cody, read us a poem.
Give me a good reason to puke.
Just got one new one.
That's all right.
"There's a hundred years
of history...
"and a hundred 'fore that...
"all gathered in the thinking
goin' on beneath his hat.
"The cold flame
burns within him...
"till his skin's
as cold as ice...
"and the dues he paid...
"to get here
are worth every sacrifice.
"All the miles
spent sleepy drivin'...
"all the money down the drain...
"all the if Is and nearlys...
"all the bandages and pain...
"all the female tears
left dryin'...
"all the fever and the fight...
"are just a small
down payment...
"on the ride he makes tonight.
"It's guts and love and glory...
"one mortal's chance at fame.
"His legacy is Rodeo...
"and Cowboy is his name."
There it is, boys.
It's the dad, all right.
Yep. He's the daddy of 'em all.
Boys, let's go get some money.
Bull riding
in Cheyenne, Wyoming...
Gonna be a bull rider, Cody?
Yes, sir.
What's your name?
Brandon.
Looks like Tuff got tired
of being a hard-ass.
With that eighty-nine score
Jim Schott just turned in...
we're looking
at some wild bull riding...
here in old Cheyenne.
I think you'll have to be
in the nineties to place here.
There's no doubt this man is
an in-house favorite here today.
This is Lane Frost of Oklahoma,
seven times...
Whoa!
Bear down.
No need to be rude.
The best of bull riding.
Let's win some money.
Ride 'em, champ!
OK, boys!
All right!
Watch this cowboy
as he tries to ride this bull!
Friends, this may be
the wildest steer...
that we're watching right here!
Plenty strong!
Go, Lane!
All right!
Tell you one thing,
ladies and gentlemen...
you have just watched
some kind of great bull ride...
by that champion cowboy!
A nasty punch from that bull!
This man may be hurt!
Sure hope this is not an injury
of a serious nature.
You don't see these cowboys
call for help very often.
Paramedics are on their way in.
Lane has ridden that bull
for ninety-two points.
I been sitting here...
trying to remember
if I ever told him...
if I told him
I was proud of him.
I know...
that he did a good job.
But I...
I can't remember...
a single time...
I told him...
I loved him.
It's warming up a bit.
Yeah, think so.
They're giving a special award
for Lane at the Finals.
They want you to accept it.
You do it, Tuff.
They'd like for you
to be there, Kellie.
I have to start a new life.
I'm going back to school.
I'm trying to make some plans.
It's just too hard to be
around rodeo right now.
Back in the spring, Lane said...
"This is your year."
That I'd win the championship.
I told him he was full of it.
Now it's only a week away,
and...
I really think
that I got a chance.
I never had anybody
believe that much in me.
He really loved you, Tuff.
It's been in the papers.
You've seen it on TV.
Tuff Hedeman has declared
he'll win the World Title...
in memory of
his fallen partner Lane Frost.
Remember, Frost was killed
last summer at Cheyenne...
when a broken rib
pierced his heart.
Tuff is dedicating his last ride
to the memory of his friend.
OK, boys!
All he's got to do is beat
that eighty-nine-point-five.
Good little bull ride
started here.
He's showing some determination
to really ride!
Look at him! He's proving
what he said he could do!
He did it!
What a bull ride!
We'll have that score
coming up for Tuff Hedeman!
Is he hung up?
No. He's riding for Lane now.
Remember he dedicated it?
I'll betcha somebody's smiling
upstairs right now.
Ride him!
Lane Frost,
he's riding for you, my friend.
Ninety-one points!
Your new
World's Champion cowboy!
I feel like he's with me
all the time.
I know deep down in my heart...
he was the greatest influence
that I ever had.
Don't be afraid to go after...
what you want to do
and what you want to be.
But don't be afraid
to be willing to pay the price.
