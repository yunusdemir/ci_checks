ALICE IN THE CITIES
A FILM BY WIM WENDERS
It just never shows what you saw!
Shoot it!
Shoot down everything
you can't stand.
Talking to yourself...
Actually, it's more like
listening than talking.
I've never heard that to the end!
FLIGHT CONTROLLERS ON STRIKE
I'm not finished yet.
I took a lot
of pictures and notes.
I've got enough material.
You weren't supposed to take pictures.
You were supposed to write a story.
Yes, I know.
But the story
is about things you can see.
About images and signs.
You've been on the road
for four weeks now,
and all you've got
is a bunch of pictures.
You were supposed
to write something.
I could have gotten pictures
somewhere else.
You were supposed to write
about the American landscape.
I've already gotten three telexes
from the publisher in Munich,
and I look like an idiot.
So what do I do now?
I'm not done yet. That's all.
When you drive around America,
something happens to you.
The images you see change you.
And the reason
I took so many photos...
is part of the story.
I can't explain it now.
Tell that to the publisher.
You won't meet the deadline.
That's all I can say.
I'll finish the story in Germany.
I fly to Munich today.
Do you have money
for the ticket?
Just enough for the ticket.
But I meant to ask you
for an advance.
My dear friend...
you won't get
a penny from me.
And take your picture
postcards with you.
I'll tell the publisher
you're coming back to Munich
and that I've got nothing
to do with this anymore.
Because of the
flight controllers' strike.
I read about it but didn't realize
there were no flights to Germany.
But I must fly back today!
She just suggested
a flight to Amsterdam.
Of all places!
I was in Amsterdam long enough.
That's the only way.
Can you ask when the next flight
to Amsterdam is today?
Tomorrow afternoon.
We can't go till tomorrow,
and only to Amsterdam.
<i>We haven't been there
in a long time.</i>
Are you from Holland?
We lived there.
Could you book
the flight for me?
My English is so bad.
Your first name.
Lisa and Alice.
Would you wait with us?
Otherwise
I don't know how I'll stand it.
I can do that,
but I'm not very entertaining.
You could be mute for all I care.
What does he want from us?
Why?
What do you have against him?
He's quite nice.
I don't have anything against him.
But what does he want?
He just helped us at the flight desk.
You could be a little nicer.
If you spoke English,
everything would be different.
That was quick.
- Nobody home.
- Who wasn't home?
- Have you decided?
- No hamburgers!
- What do you want, then?
- A hot dog.
I hope the hotel isn't too expensive.
No, I used to stay there myself.
Why are you
in such a hurry to leave?
I want to get back to Germany.
I just broke up with a man.
But I can't speak about it now.
- See you tomorrow at the airport.
- Don't you want to have breakfast with us?
I'll call you tomorrow morning
here at the hotel.
Sure?
I called a few times.
Aren't you well?
No.
I got completely lost.
It was a horrible journey.
Once you leave New York City,
nothing changes anymore.
It all looks the same.
You can't imagine anything anymore.
Above all,
you can't imagine any change.
I became estranged from myself.
All I could imagine
was going on and on like this forever.
Some nights, I was sure
I would go back the next morning.
But then I'd keep on driving...
listening to that vulgar radio,
and every night in a motel
that looked just like
all the others before.
I'd watch that barbarous television.
I didn't know what hit me.
You haven't known that
for a long time now.
You don't have to travel
across America for that.
That happens when you lose
all sense of your own self.
And you lost that long ago.
That's why you always need proof,
proof you still exist.
Your stories and your experiences -
you treat them like raw eggs.
As if you were the only one
to experience things.
And that's why
you keep taking pictures.
They're something
you can hold on to,
more evidence that it was you
who saw these things.
And that's why you came here.
To have someone listen to you,
to you and your stories
that you're only telling to yourself.
But that's not enough
in the long run, my dear.
That's right.
Taking pictures
is a way of proving things.
Waiting for the image to develop,
I was often filled
with a strange unease.
I could hardly wait
to compare the picture with reality.
But comparing them
wouldn't reassure me either.
As the still images
were always overtaken by reality...
You can't stay here!
...I photographed
even more obsessively.
- You're really beside yourself!
- That's why I only took Polaroids...
I don't want you to stay here,
understand?
What?
Are you serious?
Yes, my friend.
I can't help you.
Though I'd like to comfort you.
I don't understand.
I don't know how to live either.
Nobody has shown me either.
In this city...
when you reach an intersection...
it's like...
entering a clearing in the woods.
I have to get a room
here at the hotel too.
- Have a look!
- My friend...
I'll bet you
I can blow it out from here.
Never!
Watch.
Show me your watch.
You cheated!
To make up for that,
you'll take me there tomorrow.
Go to bed now.
Why don't you stay here?
There's plenty of room.
During the last two years,
we've lived in four different cities.
Where?
Where?
Now he's been working here
for three months...
and wants to settle
in America for good.
But I don't think
he believes I'm serious.
He expects me to come back
tonight with my suitcase,
cry all night,
and everything will be fine again.
He isn't Alice's father?
Alice told me a joke this afternoon.
Do you know it?
How do four elephants fit
into a red Volkswagen?
I can't sleep with you
But I'd like to share
the bed with you.
What are you writing?
“What's so barbaric about this TV
is not that it chops up everything
and interrupts it with ads,
though that's bad enough.
Far worse is that everything it shows
turns into advertising too,
ads for the status quo.
All these TV images come down
to the same common, ugly message,
a kind of vicious contempt.
No image leaves you in peace.
They all want something from you.”
When I told Hans
I wanted to break up...
he said everything would be fine
once we had a place in New York.
He should stay in Europe
if he doesn't want to lose you.
He says he'd rather kill himself.
I'll meet you at the Empire
State Building at 1:00 p.m.”
Your jacket is much too large.
What have you got in there?
Hot dogs?
So that's how it is!
No need to wait here any longer.
Do you have
another dime for me?
No, we need to go back
to the hotel now.
Mommy isn't coming anymore?
Hey, you mustn't do that!
The lady left the hotel
one hour ago.
“L can't leave yet. Hans is desperate.
I can't leave him alone now.
Please take Alice with you
or I'll never get away from here.
Wait for me in Amsterdam.
I'll be there the day after tomorrow.”
Who wrote to you?
- Your mother.
- What did she write?
That she'll join us
in Amsterdam.
I saw all that when we got here.
Do you have all you need
in your suitcase?
Do you like flying?
I like the food.
It's nicely wrapped up.
I was looking for you!
Can't you bring me
something to eat?
Let's go. That's our flight.
Are you looking forward
to going home?
I don't know.
I'd just as well stay in New York.
Why don't you then?
I have no money left.
There's nothing on it!
You have to wait a few minutes.
It gets very sharp.
What did you ask the stewardess?
I asked for an aspirin.
Mommy's afraid of flying too.
She even gets headaches beforehand.
Maybe I should've eaten something.
You see!
It's a nice picture. it's so empty.
Is there...
an L?
Is there... a U?
Yes.
Only one?
One U, yes. it's not a Zulu.
Is there an H?
No.
Is there an F?
No, we had that already.
We had that already.
Is there an O?
No.
One more line...
and you're hanged.
- An I?
- No.
What's the word?
“Dream.”
“Dream.”
Words like that don't count.
Only things that really exist.
Why is the time different here?
Can't you see?
It's already light.
At midnight?
Believe me, it's 5:00 a.m.
Will we go back to sleep?
At the closest hotel to the airport.
No matter how much it costs.
I'm not tired anymore.
There's no way I can go to sleep.
When do you want to wake up?
At 11:00.
Yes, yes. Thanks.
Can I use your toothbrush?
If you don't mind.
Will we go downtown
and buy one?
Go downtown for a toothbrush?
I don't believe it!
Do you want to stay
at the hotel?
Yes.
I could show you around.
I used to live here.
I had a strange dream.
I turned on the TV.
I sat down in a chair
and tied myself to it,
and then suddenly
a horror movie came on.
And I couldn't get free.
I couldn't turn off the TV either.
I couldn't close my eyes.
I couldn't untie myself.
So I had to watch the movie.
Tell me something about yourself.
I don't know what to tell you.
You really don't know a thing
you could tell me about yourself?
How old are you?
Thirty-one.
I want to take your picture.
So at least you'll know
what you look like.
Will you take a picture of Mommy
when she arrives at the airport?
We'll have to get up early.
As soon as we're back in the canals,
we'll go onshore.
But the tour isn't over.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I don't want to see anything.
I want to go back to the hotel.
I'm hungry!
You're walking too fast!
Amsterdam!
Amsterdam is
much more beautiful than New York!
Well...
Food!
That's all you think about.
I want to eat!
Do we have to eat
in such a cheap restaurant?
I don't have much money left.
Then why are we staying
at such an expensive hotel?
Because it's next to the airport.
It's all in Dutch.
I can't read it.
That doesn't help!
You wanted me to read.
I don't want to eat here!
We came here because of you,
remember?
I do want to eat,
but not just anything.
- What do you want to eat?
- A real meal.
Listen, I won't let you
tyrannize me any longer.
Because of you,
I'm wandering around this town!
It's not my fault!
You are so stupid!
Baby face!
You'll be glad to get rid of me,
won't you?
Don't be bitchy.
I'll read you a story.
I can read on my own.
Do you leave a light on
when you go to sleep?
What do you mean?
Want me to leave a light on?
Yes.
I can't sleep without a light.
I'll turn on the bathroom light
and leave the door ajar.
What is it?
Fear.
What kind of fear?
Are there different kinds?
Yes.
I'm afraid of fear.
Why are you afraid of fear?
Yes. Why?
Aren't you cold?
Can't you dry yourself
in the bedroom?
I've got to go to the toilet.
What are the matches for?
So it doesn't stink.
All the passengers from New York
came through long ago.
I asked. Your mother wasn't
on the list of passengers.
We'll go to the information desk.
Then we'll see.
Is that your daughter back there?
She's been crying the whole time.
Maybe you should look after her.
You may come in.
Open up.
Alice, please come out.
Why didn't she come?
I'm sure she'll be
on the next flight.
We'll go to the information desk
and sort it all out.
What do you want to sort out?
They'll take care of you.
You just want to get rid of me.
Alice, I can't wait here at the airport
forever for your mother!
But I'm supposed to?
Where do you want to go then?
I don't know.
Didn't you say you wanted
to visit your grandmother?
Yes.
- Where does she live?
- I don't know.
- But you can surely remember.
- I can.
See.
So?
I can't think of it right now.
Don't you even remember
the town?
I don't know the name anymore.
Maybe she lives in...
Frankfurt?
- No.
Gelsenkirchen?
Göttingen?
Hamburg?
Hanover?
Heidelberg?
Kassel?
Koblenz?
Cologne?
Ludwigshafen?
Lübeck? Mainz?
Mannheim?
Mönchengladbach?
Munich?
Nuremberg?
Oberhausen?
Offenbach?
Recklinghausen?
Saarbrücken?
Trier? I wouldn't want
to live in Trier either.
Ulm?
Now I've reached W.
Wiesbaden?
No.
Worms?
No.
Würzburg?
No.
Wuppertal
_ Wuppertal?
And where in Wuppertal?
I know exactly where.
I'll find it when we're there.
How do you want your hair?
Alice?
Can you tell the hairdresser
not to cut away too much?
Only to layer the ends.
<i>Don't make it too short.
He wants ...</i>
What does “layer” mean?
<i>I don't understand.
Does he want me to thin it out?</i>
<i>I think it's thin enough.</i>
<i>Should I wash his hair
and give him a scalp massage ?</i>
- <i>Sounds like a good idea.</i>
- <i>What did he say?</i>
Nothing.
When does our bus leave?
At 4:00.
Alice, please. You must know
your grandmother's name!
Not Van Darn?
That's my name!
Grandma has another name.
Your mother.
What was her maiden name?
What was her name
before she got married?
I don't know!
But I do know
where Grandma lives!
I'll show you
when we pass by.
Come on, Alice.
It's getting dark.
We have to find a hotel.
We'll continue tomorrow.
Stop crying!
Alice, don't get discouraged.
We haven't really
started looking for her.
Tomorrow we'll go to city hall.
But I don't know the name!
Will you tell me a story?
I don't know any stories!
Once upon a time
there was a man.
Where'd you get that radio?
- I traded with the girl on the bus.
Once there was a little boy
who had gotten lost.
He'd gone for a walk
in the woods with his mother
on a beautiful summer afternoon.
When they came to a clearing...
where the sun was shining...
his mother suddenly felt tired
and wanted to rest.
All of a sudden the boy heard
a rustling in the bushes,
and he discovered a hedgehog.
He followed the hedgehog
until he came to a stream.
And in the stream he saw a fish.
He walked along the stream
for a long time
until he reached a bridge.
On the bridge
he saw a horseman.
And then?
The horseman...
sat very quietly on his horse
and looked into the distance.
The boy went up to the bridge
and walked cautiously
around the horse.
Then the horseman
rode slowly away.
The boy followed him
until he lost sight of him.
And he reached a big road.
On the road
there were many trucks.
The boy waited on the roadside
until a truck stopped.
The driver asked him
if he needed a ride.
The boy was delighted.
He was proud
to sit next to the driver,
who let him turn the dial
on the radio.
And the boy drove with him
until they reached the sea.
And at the sea
he remembered his mother.
I don't like my cornflakes like this.
They're already soggy.
I want to pour on
the milk myself.
Bring her another bowl.
And tea for me.
I've rented a car.
We'll drive down all the streets.
Then we'll surely find the house.
When I see it, I'll recognize it.
What kind of car?
- A Renault.
- A big one?
- No.
I thought you had no money left.
I found a few Eurochecks
from last year.
At the car rental
they didn't notice.
Where does that come from?
What?
I forgot to give it back.
What does the house look like?
It was old.
There were trees.
That's all you remember?
The staircase was dark.
It's vibrating.
What's green
and jumps from tree to tree?
You better pay attention.
You'll never guess.
Look for your house.
School is out.
That's the street where our hotel is!
So?
I'm thirsty.
<i>- What can I get you?</i>
- A coffee.
I want something too.
Then order something.
A big sundae.
<i>- Whipped cream?</i>
- Yes.
<i>- Mixed flavors?</i>
- Yes.
- I thought you were thirsty.
- But I want ice cream.
Grandma doesn't live
in Wuppertal.
Here you are.
My, my. . .
Why didn't you say so before?
Do you think -
Do you think I'm keen
on driving around with little girls
and spending my last dime?
God knows
I've got other things to do.
I wanted to stay in Amsterdam.
What do you have to do anyway?
You're only scribbling away
in your notebook.
I'm taking you to the police now.
They can help you better than I.
<i>Please sign here.</i>
<i>Can we reach you at the hotel,
at least until tomorrow,</i>
<i>in case we have any questions?
- Yes.</i>
<i>If you leave...</i>
<i>please inform us
and give us your new address.</i>
Oh, my pen. Can you give it back?
You accidentally put it away.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
Take care.
I'm sure
they'll find your grandma.
Or your mother.
Now I know where my grandma lives.
Do you?
Well, then we'd better get going.
- Yes.
- No!
Earlier on,
one of the policemen was here.
But I stayed
on the other side of street.
You can't imagine what
they gave me to eat at the station.
When the policemen
questioned me,
I remembered
that Mommy and I
used to live here in Wuppertal.
When I was little.
Not my grandma.
The policemen looked it up...
and I was right.
And Mommy wasn't called
Van Darn, but Krüger.
And then I remembered,
and I told the police
that we used to travel
to Grandma's by train.
And it couldn't be
very far from here,
because we were always
back in the evening.
And when Grandma
read a story to me,
the pages always rustled
when she turned them,
because little pieces of coal
came in through the window.
Then the policemen said that
that makes it easy.
Grandma lives in the Ruhr region.
In the Ruhr region.
Is that big?
Not particularly.
We'll manage.
I went to a rock-and-roll concert.
What?
Chuck Berry was singing.
Do you know him?
I think so.
Do you like rock and roll?
Yes.
- Have a good sleep?
- Yes.
You're scribbling again?
Here's your breakfast.
And that is the Ruhr region.
There are lots of people
called Krüger.
We need to know
your grandma's first name.
Grandma!
Didn't I show you the picture?
What picture?
I didn't show it to the policemen.
And then I forgot.
Well, that makes it easy.
Of course.
- Do you know the Ruhr region?
- Yes.
I lived here as a boy.
I went to school here.
But I haven't been back
in nine or ten years.
You haven't seen your parents
in that long?
Yes, I have.
I see them now and then.
But they don't live in Duisburg now.
- Where then?
On the other side of the Rhine,
on the Lower Rhine.
Where will we go first?
To Essen.
“Essen” means “to eat.”
That sounds good.
Does it ring a bell?
No.
We'll just ask everyone
if they know this house.
Excuse me.
Do you recognize this house?
Could it be nearby?
Well, I haven't seen it
around here.
I don't know.
It's not around here.
These old buildings
are all being torn down.
Krupp wants to build
a new hospital there, and -
Thanks.
I think it's a pity that the beautiful
old houses are being torn down.
They don't bring in enough rent.
The empty spaces look like graves.
Like house graves.
Have any of you
ever seen this house?
NO SOLICITING
NO MOTOR VEHICLES
NO SOCCER OR BALL GAMES
Let's ask the taxi driver over there.
He'll know the place.
Do you know where this could be?
Not here in Duisburg, in any case.
I don't recognize it.
Maybe Oberhausen.
Hold on!
It could be in Gelsenkirchen,
around Schalke or so.
- Thanks.
- Erdbrücken Street.
Erdbrücken Street.
Next time,
it will probably be in Hamburg.
So where do we go first?
Oberhausen or Gelsenkirchen?
Oberhausen.
Where Grandma lived,
it looked quite similar.
Except that the houses
had two floors.
Do you have a girlfriend?
You know what?
I feel like going swimming.
What about you?
The water's probably dirty too.
You want to stay back there?
Yes. it's more comfortable.
What city is this?
- Gelsenkirchen.
Erdbrücken Street.
This must be it.
These are nice pictures.
At the police station
I wasn't allowed to smile.
They took pictures?
Of course.
- Stop! There it is!
- What?
This can't be.
An Italian lady lives there.
She says she's lived there
for two years.
She doesn't know anything
about Grandma.
Then we can go swimming now.
You idiot!
You silly old blockhead!
Polliwog!
Bed wetter!
- You turd!
- Stupid cow!
Fatso!
Nanny goat!
Soup bone!
- Boiling chicken!
- Pain in the neck!
I wonder if people think
you're my father.
Me?
Why?
I don't know.
What else would they think?
I'll ask that woman over there.
No, no, come.
Do you think that's my father?
No, never.
I'd bet you anything.
See? She doesn't believe it.
Why not?
Why not?
- He's too fat.
- And he's always touching his nose.
And he snores.
He probably has flat feet.
And he doesn't have any money.
Not even enough
for a proper meal.
You lying so-and-so!
You won't eat anything
but hot dogs anyway.
Are you hungry?
That's all we needed.
Someone who invites us to dinner.
You little piggy!
You really are acting
like her father.
That's true.
She's brought me to this.
But you seem to like it.
I'm afraid the second bed
is a bit lower.
How annoying.
Will you get up?
So early?
Yes, please.
Why?
It's 6:00 a.m.!
Are you insane?
Did you sleep well?
Wouldn't you rather
have slept alone too?
The couch was already taken.
You got there first.
What did you dream?
I'll tell you later.
Where do we go now?
I don't even have enough money
to fill up the tank.
We'll go to my parents' place.
I'm thirsty.
Will you stop at the next kiosk?
Yes.
“Nine-year-old sought by police.
To help find her parents last night...
a young man brought Alice Van Darn
to a police station in Wuppertal.
One moment unobserved,
the child managed to run away.
The blonde girl is wearing
a blue jacket that says 'Alaska.”'
How far is it to your parents'?
Just across the Rhine.
We'll take the ferry.
You haven't taken
any pictures in a long time.
Since Amsterdam.
Are you looking forward
to seeing your parents?
May I?
There's nothing on it yet.
It's coming.
You must explain this to me.
What?
Why didn't you get in touch
with the police station?
After all, you brought
the child there yourself.
What?
You didn't get
back in touch with us.
The police found out yesterday
where the girl's grandmother lives,
and her mother has shown up too.
Only you and the child were missing.
You were simply gone.
- How do you know that?
- I just talked to headquarters.
They told me
to take the girl
to the nearest station, in Duisburg,
and put her on a train to Munich.
- Really?
- Yes.
Follow me in your car to Duisburg.
I'll take the girl in my car.
<i>Munich is preparing
for that honorable task.</i>
<i>How old are you?</i>
Nine.
Nine.
Do you have your ticket?
Did you already return the car?
Did you get any money back?
The check just covered it.
For your ticket.
“LOST WORLD”
ON THE DEATH OF JOHN FORD
What will you do in Munich?
I'll finish writing that story.
Your scribbling?
And you?
What will you do?
