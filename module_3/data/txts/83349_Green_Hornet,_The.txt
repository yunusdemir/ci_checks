Hello, this is Seth Rogen...
...and you are listening,
for some reason...
...to The Green Hornet
audio commentary.
This is Neal Moritz who,
I guess, came up with this idea.
-Yeah, exactly.
-l'm the producer.
-He came up with the idea in 1 947.
-Yeah, exactly.
-Gondry?
-This is me, Michel Gondry.
-l did everything.
-He did everything also.
That's the logo
for my company there.
Neal Moritz's logo. His is one of
the only logos before the movie.
I'm Evan Goldberg
and l had nothing to do with this film.
-That's not true.
-That's not true.
I'll-- Should I translate for Gondry
throughout the commentary?
-lt'd be a good idea.
-No, I'm gonna have my own subtitle.
You can't have subtitles
in an audio commentary, I don't think.
So this wasn't actually
the original first scene...
...but we shot a first scene
that Michel and I thought was good...
...and Seth and Evan sucked.
Well, the problem is that
it was in a play-- ln a schoolyard...
...and Neal's son was in the scene
and just didn't, you know, pull it off.
But you realised l'm gonna
be paying that for my entire life.
-My son is not in the movie now.
-l know.
-Did you break the news to him?
-l broke it to him yesterday.
-You just told him yesterday?
-Yeah, him and my nephew.
-You told them they were cut out?
-l did.
Was it the hardest time you told
someone they were cut out?
-lt was pretty rough.
-Oh, man.
At any juncture, did you say,
"That's showbiz"?
No, but I did say it's whirly-dirly.
-lt was a whirly-dirly world.
-Life's a whirly-burly--
A whirly-dirly world.
And there's Tom Wilkinson,
obviously...
...who Seth has worked with
in the past.
-No, I did.
-l mean, Michel worked with him.
-Eternal Sunshine.
-Otherwise, he'd not have done that.
Let's talk about Josh before
he disappear forever from the film.
-Yeah.
-The little brat.
This kid was a handful,
but ultimately--
-He delivered?
-He got--
We got what we needed.
He's got chosen over another one
because he was more chubby.
Exactly, l will say that.
It's funny, l went through
all the trouble losing this weight...
...and they went and cast a fat kid.
First thing is, "We need a chubby kid."
But just, l want everybody to know,
Tom Wilkinson's skin...
...is pulled back here
to make him look younger.
It's true, we did some weird--
-For real?
-Yes, he's actually pulled back.
And originally, Edward James Olmos
came in right now...
...and we did, like, a young version
of Edward James Olmos and it looks--
It looked exactly like Edward James
Olmos from Miami Vice.
-A nice, rich brown moustache?
-Yeah.
Okay, so here, we're gonna see for
a very short moment the group Anvil.
-Are they actually in there?
-Well, no.
They are just in the TV in the back--
-Just in the back room?
-Yeah.
Anvil learned a lesson. Just because
you shoot in a movie doesn't mean--
Anvil-- So far, Anvil and your son
are the casualties.
-And my nephew.
-And your nephew.
-We should keep a list of the people--
-And, well, we just keep Eddie.
Oh, man, the greatest guy
and he's an amazing actor...
...and we just wrote the scene
really poorly and so we had to redo it...
...and that was yet another victim
to our incompetence.
But the winner was--
Our special cameo
who come right now.
It's true. lt's really nice
of James Franco to have done this.
-l like to say that on the record.
-Actually, we are the winner.
And l have to-- l'll admit I thought
this scene was way too long and--
-lt plays well.
-lt's still long.
It's definitely a little long.
It's the kind of thing that, like,
even now when you watch--
I remember we watched Superbad
and everyone laughed hard...
...and when you watch it on HBO,
you're like:
"Every scene
is a minute and a half too long."
And we left, like, long pauses
for laughter...
...which we should have taken out.
But every expression of James
is hilarious.
Should we should talk a little bit
about how Christoph Waltz became--
-Bloodnofsky?
-Bloodnofsky, Chudnofsky.
-Bad-- The villain.
-The villain.
Well, we originally had
Nicolas Cage.
Can you do the imitation of
Nicolas Cage with a reggae voice?
"Green Hornet, I'm gonna kill you,
Green Hornet. Sure.
Lord have mercy.
Bomboclat, Green Hornet," and....
We couldn't feign our surprise
when we heard him doing this voice.
-Man, l'll be honest--
-lt was like the weirdest ever.
-We just missed Anvil.
-One second.
I remember me and Evan, this is--
I shouldn't be telling this story,
but I will.
I don't know if anyone listens.
I remember me and Evan driving
to the meeting with Nicolas Cage...
...and l said,
"If he does the Jamaican accent...
...l won't be able to handle it.
Like, l don't like--
I don't know what l'm gonna do."
I remember saying, "I don't know
what I'm gonna do if he does it."
Like, "l just don't know
how l'm gonna deal with that"...
...and then he actually did it,
and l think he kind of expected us--
It almost as--
It was though when he ended...
...he expected us to kind of stand up
and applaud and go crazy.
-No, maybe not so, but--
-There was this silence.
We-- Our reaction was extremely cold.
We just couldn't believe--
He said, "Our reaction was extremely
cold." That was what Gondry said.
And he skipped the meal.
Amy had ordered a beautiful meal
with sushi, and he just went home.
He left dinner. He bailed.
That version of the movie
might have been interesting.
It might have been interesting.
Every time l watch it, I think that.
Nicolas Cage, every blue moon,
he delivers the greatest--
He's always pretty solid.
-Sometimes knocks it out of the park.
-lt's true.
Just so everybody knows,
we shot this act-- This scene...
...actually on the set of Burlesque.
This is Cher and Christina Aguilera's
dressing room in Burlesque.
And this scene was actually shot
in 3D.
Can't you tell?
But, yeah.
That's where Christina Aguilera
learned the ropes...
...of the world of burlesque dancing
from a very mean and strict Cher.
But this scene really does set the tone
for the movie.
It was a brilliant addition to have
this kind of really set the tone...
...of comedy-action.
So now the question is,
where is the gun coming from?
-Anyone can answer.
-No, it's-- Magic is the answer.
-What pocket is containing the gun?
-lf viewers will notice...
...that, yes, you never understand
where the hell this gun comes from.
We-- At one point,
Gondry, we insisted that we build...
...like, this crazy holster
for the gun...
...and it was supposed to go
underneath his coat...
...but it looked like he was hiding
a minivan underneath his jacket.
-lt looked ridiculous.
-l had done this very cool design...
...to hide the gun for this scene
that you guys rejected.
Oh, yeah, so Gondry had this idea
where Christoph is--
It's like a suitcase
with a map of the city in it.
-And it's like--
-lt's like a 3D map. Like Lego-ish.
Yeah, like a Lego-ish map,
and as he displays the city...
...he takes the buildings and builds
his double-barrelled gun out of it.
-We'll have that in the DVD.
-Yeah, you actually built it.
I'm sure-- l'm sure we will find that
in a Michel Gondry video.
Yeah, exactly. But--
Hey, wasn't one of your videos
in the movie at some point?
-We--
-Oh, yes, it was me.
-The coloured one?
-Yeah. I don't think it's still there.
But the double barrel
was my concept.
That was one of your early additions
to the movie.
And there is a payoff at the end
that you guys resisted...
-...but I think l won you over.
-Totally.
-We were in such a good mood.
-l fought you so hard on that.
And when-- As l was sitting there,
realising that it worked at the end...
...l was actually happy for you
more than I was angry.
This actually really happened
right here.
That's a very practical shot.
There's--
That's a visual effect, but we blew up
that building right behind Christoph.
The Pony Room is a reference
to the original Green Hornet TV show.
There's an episode where a bar called
The Pony Room is the epicentre...
...and they do some kinky stuff
in there in the episode.
We can say "shit,"
it's a PG-1 3 movie, I guess, right?
But they do some kinky shit
in there...
...where the girls dress like ponies.
Remember that?
Tell us the story about
what was going on with the fridge.
Oh, man, that shot's insane.
So these lunatics who were working
our Special-Effects Department...
...were the awesomest dudes.
Instead of throwing that fridge out...
...built a cannon
to launch the fridge out the window...
...and me and Raffi, our co-producer,
who's an extra in this scene.
These are our friends in real life,
which is kind of embarrassing.
-There's my sister.
-But they launched the fridge out.
Yeah.
-That's-- There's--
-Nicky in the background, blond hair.
James Weaver and Raffi,
our co-producer was in that scene.
-My girlfriend was in that scene.
-Another person that got cut.
My girlfriend
was in the other dancing party scene.
This house
is an actually incredible house...
...that l think was for sale
for $65 million.
Here's the craziest thing.
This house is insane.
It's the biggest house
I've seen in my entire life.
It has George Washington's carpet,
is in the house.
Marie Antoinette's furniture
in the house.
But this garage scene,
we built this on stage.
Actually, you just passed
one of my cars...
...but being a car guy,
I loved every car in this--
And the Black Beauty actually
is the cheapest car of all of my--
Yeah, by far. Yeah, exactly.
But anyway, that crazy house...
...there was, like, a whole wing
for the help and stuff like that...
...and we were--
Our craft service was set up in there...
...and we noticed that there was--
The laundry machines
were in the garage there...
...and they were all coin-operated.
The people who own the house
made them coin-operated.
It's kind of like the darkest--
Makes me have no faith in humanity.
It was a cold house.
And that house is in the movie 2012.
It gets blown up, l think.
Why would someone
who owns a $1 50 million house...
...need to rent it out
to movie companies?
-lt's called divorce.
-Exactly.
-lt's called divorce.
-Yeah.
It's called property tax.
And this was a beautiful set...
...that our production designer,
Owen Paterson built...
...at Culver Studios...
...and you'll see why it was built
because later on, we destroy it.
But Owen Paterson
has an incredible logo...
-...which is "if you build it, destroy it."
-lt's true.
-Yeah, logo, motto.
-l think it's called a saying.
-Motto.
-lt's a motto. "Logo"?
Did they shoot the original
Green Hornet in this studio?
No, I think they did it in Universal
actually, for Warner Bros.
If you rewatch the show, very clearly
they're soundstages.
There's a lot of weird posters
on the wall...
...and honestly,
some of them are strange.
-There's like-- Chickenfoot.
-Chickenfoot.
I can't stand behind all of those,
creatively. l'll be honest.
Some people would come up,
"Hey, you a big Chickenfoot fan?"
-"No." I don't get it. Someone--
-You're playing a director.
I know l am. But l can't even defend
how Reid would like Chickenfoot.
But maybe Chickenfoot's awesome.
-James Franco liked Chickenfoot?
-Wait.
Wasn't this--? lsn't the girl here who
plays your girlfriend from the show--?
America's Next Top Model.
Well, l should point out that shot
that said "City Under Siege"...
...the word "siege" was spelled wrong
for a long time. That's a visual effect.
We had to fix how the word "siege"
was spelled.
-Spelled wrong by Andy Siegel.
-Our prop guy, Andy Siegel.
Who was a wonderful--
And only the Swedish-market
people found out.
Aside from his spelling,
he's the best prop guy in the universe.
But we had a Canadian team
and a French team--
There, that's a visual effect. That--
We had to change that right there.
Exactly. There's a lot of foreigners
working on this movie, so....
But America is a culture of foreigners,
right?
It's true. We're all foreigners.
We're all--
This shot, we're all convinced,
looks weird in 3D.
-lt really--
-lt really does.
It actually doesn't--
It looks weird only if you were actually
at the real location.
I think that's true.
We know what it's actually like.
-And then it's weird.
-lt just seems like the front yard is....
This part of the movie
is a little bumpy.
I think I'd take-- Should we take--?
Who should take blame
for the bumpiness of this part?
No, I don't-- l think-- You know what?
When you see a full movie....
-There's always bumpiness.
-You-- You already identified...
...the by-path as more important
than they are.
I think you fail to realise
how quick this is.
I think there's an important story
being told about this scene.
It was inspired a little bit...
...by the passing of Michael Jackson,
who is my hero.
And he-- lt happened one block away
from this house, from right there...
...the day we location-scouted
the house.
So it was quite dramatic,
and we had this big show on...
...and you would see Michael
being pulled, taken away.
Kind of looked like that. Way to bring
down the audio commentary.
-Well, that's the sad part of the movie.
-lt's okay. You're right, it is.
This shot's cool.
When did you plan this?
When did you get the idea to do
this transition from house to coffin?
Actually, it was supposed to be
the swimming pool to the coffin...
...and it was too long, so l said, "Okay,
well, the house is good enough."
-lt works better with the house?
-l know.
It's closer in shape to the house.
It's much--
It's like the exact same shape.
-There you go, happy accident.
-Yeah.
-Very good performance from Seth.
-Right here. Look how sad l looked.
-Another person--
-Pissed off and sad.
-No.
-Go ahead.
No, I was gonna say Britt Reid's
secretary, who gets fired...
...is not in the movie anymore,
except for that.
Right. There's another person
fell victim to our incompetence.
It's a beautiful statue that was built.
I have it in the foyer of my house.
Yeah, Neal has that...
...except now there's champagne
pouring out of his mouth, right?
He just-- He took the hair off
and now it's him.
Exactly. You shaved it.
I keep telling my kids, "That was
when l was very young, guys."
It's weird shooting
in a cemetery, right?
You kind of like are walking
all over people's graves.
Especially, that's a famous cemetery
in Hollywood, a lot of--
They just, like, put, like, a camera
on someone's grave.
When you have 20 minutes between
setups, you got something to look at.
It was interesting to walk around,
and it was weird being there at night.
-But it was less scary.
-How about when foggy?
We can talk about David Harbour,
who l think--
-ls awesome.
--is awesome in the film.
When he auditioned, after he left...
...l turned to everyone, said,
"He's the greatest actor."
And they've been making fun
of me for it. But isn't he?
He's one of the greatest actors
I've ever seen.
My personal fight was for-- Obviously
I can't say Tupper. Edward Furlong.
I thought this guy--
I think this guy is a genius.
Oh, he's so good.
This building where we shot
at The Daily Sentinel...
...was actually the building
where Creative Artist Agency resides.
It's true, where Michel Gondry
is represented...
...at the time of the recording
of this audio commentary.
Now I'm gonna be fired.
This is another beautiful set
that Owen Paterson built.
-Yeah, this is all fake.
-Took the whole stage.
And we build the biggest
translite ever, right?
Yeah, the backdrop we had...
...is one of the biggest
one of those backdrops ever.
Where you can see the city...
...and went on for l think 1 50 feet
or something like that.
It was amazing,
it was kind of disorienting.
I mean, being in there
kind of looked like you were there.
On every-- You can observe every part
of the set--
Notice
the honeycomb-shaped light?
But that's gonna be destroyed, and
you're gonna see every single part...
...going to shreds.
Yeah, it's pretty great.
There's the great
Edward James Olmos, obviously.
-Been in some of my favourite movies.
-Captain Adama?
-Stand and Deliver.
-That's great. "What's calculus?"
Oh, l kept a surprise for you
on this picture in the 3D.
-What?
-l didn't tell you.
What's gonna happen?
Is his hand gonna come out
and molest me in 3D?
I guess sort of.
Now, l was just explaining
to someone...
-That looks like a terrible coffee.
-...the wonders of ADR...
...and how a lot of lines
are recorded afterwards...
...due to the incompetence of mine
and Evan's joke writing, mostly.
But things like,
"Where's my foamy leaf?"
Or like, "Oh, damn bush."
-All this stuff, we recorded this, like--
-Grumble, grumble.
We recorded this two weeks ago.
There's lots of head bobbling in
this scene. I'm trying to stop you, but--
Here's another upcoming loss,
on the right side of the screen.
-Yes, Amy. Very nice Amy.
-We digitally removed--
I think you can see her legs, actually,
for a second.
-You can.
-lt's kind of a ghost there.
In 3D, you can see the legs
a bit more.
It's because we used
high-end digital removal.
If you're listening, Amy,
we're sorry we digitally removed you.
Here comes Kato.
So the story of the motorbike.
That was a bike
that was built for us by Harley.
Went through a lot of discussion
on that bike.
We did. And it's so funny because
it seems irrelevant now, right?
Yes, it does.
Personally, I'd have liked it
more brighter.
Yes, it does.
It would be cooler--
Had a million conversations...
...about how expensive the bike could
look, how badass it could look.
-l forgot. Kato couldn't afford the parts.
-He couldn't afford that.
-That's insane. That's crazy.
-That's--
And now it seems completely
inconsequential.
You even remember what side
of the conversation you were.
I don't know what opinion l had.
We would all flip-flop back and forth
all the time.
Well, the gas gun scene is probably
the most hotly debated thing.
I know, and you guys wanted
to lose it altogether.
At one point, at another point,
I demanded it be in the movie--
And why would you want to lose
the camera explosion?
-l remember that.
-We wanted to lose the gas gun?
You and I, at one point,
flipped completely...
...and we're like,
"Shouldn't do this gas gun shit."
You do those test screening
with your four best friends...
...and you come up
with the most crazy decision.
-But a few good ideas came out of it.
-Yeah, it's true.
But if I listen to my girlfriend comment
on my decision...
...it would be a disaster.
That's the difference with me
and you guys, l only listen to myself.
Exactly. Neal's the lone wolf here.
That coffee was awesome. We had
these guys who make that coffee...
...and l would drink, like, 500 cups
a day, l was cracked out on coffee.
The fellow's name,
remember his name?
He was Australian,
if l'm not mistaken.
He was a good guy
and an incredible barista.
Makes some good-ass coffee.
I probably had like 1 5 a day
when he was there.
Just think about how many jokes
in the movie are done from ADR.
That's what l was saying. Yeah.
Well, even the thing right here,
that stuff about Japan.
"Love Japan."
ADR, we just recorded that.
One of the biggest laughs
in the movie.
And the good impression.
We saved this scene with ADR jokes.
This scene sucked before we added
these ADR jokes. l'll admit it.
I think we should stop doing live action
because movies--
Don't you see we become too
dependent on the audience?
By, like, being so slave
to the reaction of the--?
-No, because--
-l think when you make a comedy...
...if they're not laughing, you're failing.
They need to keep laughing.
Like, a comedy's success is gauged
on the audience in a lot of ways.
Well, there is some comedies
where they're more-- Is really offbeat.
But l guess they probably cut film, and
they didn't work with the audience.
Yeah, l mean--
-Some of those are my favourites.
-Exactly.
After the meeting we were in today
with 50 marketing people...
...l think that if any of us think
that we weren't making a movie...
...that ultimately was gonna play
for mass audience....
Once we shot a Carl's Jr. commercial
we were sure...
...that it was supposed to be
for a lot of people.
Has anybody here gotten a free burger
out of this yet?
I haven't.
I expect to get one of those cards...
...free burgers for life,
something to that effect.
-We'll work-- We'll work on that.
-l just want a hamburger.
Does anybody wanna talk about
how we came to be that Jay Chou...
-...is playing Kato in the movie?
-lt's been--
There's a succession of--
A long succession of--
Well, before--
I mean, first we had Stephen Chow.
I'll be honest. Mine and Evan's
first choice for this, originally.
All of ours, I think even Gondry's
first choice was Stephen Chow.
They asked me to do the movie...
...saying Stephen Chow
was playing Kato.
-l said he should direct the film.
-We already tried that. lt didn't work.
So me and Evan, you know...
...we were huge fans of
Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer...
...so when we wrote the script,
"It would be badass...
...if Stephen Chow directed it
and played Kato, it'll be awesome."
And we sent him the script,
and he was like, "I'm in. l'll do it."
-Something he's a big fan of saying--
-Look what's coming up.
-Our homage to Bruce Lee.
-Our homage to Bruce Lee.
So it didn't work out with us
and him as a director.
Then there was a moment
where Gondry was gonna direct it...
...and Kato was gonna be Chow--
Stephen.
And l was gonna be Britt.
Honestly, I wanted to cry.
I was so upset,
because l like him so much...
...and the way he came all the way--
It was so upsetting.
We kept saying he was gonna come
from Hong Kong to meet with us.
Like, "Don't come unless you're
doing it. You've had a lot of notes."
We're at the point where, "You can't
come unless committing to doing it."
But in saying all that,
as much as we're all the hugest fans...
-...of Stephen Chow--
-Jay Chou.
--l don't think we could've done
better than what we did.
We got a secret meeting
with a guy from Hong Kong...
-...who's called Mr. Ping-Pong or--
-No, Bill Pong.
-Bill Kong.
-Bill Pong.
-Bill Kong.
-Bill Kong.
And he told us to--
He suggested strongly
we take Jay Chou.
Yeah, and then I remember
we saw Jay Chou.
Well,
then our lives became primarily...
...about researching
who are cool young dudes from Asia.
Having satellite conferences.
A weird point in our lives,
but that's what we did a lot.
And when we saw Jay Chou,
it was in this movie called....
-lnitial D. Is that--?
-Kung Fu Dunk.
-No, it was the school.
-Yeah. Kung Fu Dunk.
-lt was the school.
-Fight Back to School.
No, no. The school one
where there's a guy--
Yeah, that was Sing.
No, that was Sing....
-Itwas Kung Fu Dunk.
-Where he was spinning on the table--
Itwas Kung Fu Dunk,
and it was a scene where Jay Chou...
...was beating the shit out of a bunch
of dudes in a bar.
He was cool and funny,
he had these cool gestures.
-He had an attitude.
-Lot of attitude. His hair looked cool.
So we, you know--
We brought him down--
No, first, we conferenced him
over Skype, and it was really weird.
We auditioned with him
over Skype...
...and there was a huge delay,
I remember.
But what was nice
is he was not desperate to get the role.
He had this sort of unassuming quality
that makes him very charming.
He wasn't desperate,
and an unassuming quality.
He was the most endearing guy
from point one...
...and l have to really give
Amy Pascal credit.
If you remember,
we went in with another guy...
...who we wanted
and we thought was right for the role.
I don't know if you remember, during
the meeting, we were to a point--
Evan-- I've never heard-- Evan kind of
went off the rails a bit in that meeting.
Got a little mad.
We were committing suicide--
-And kind of spazzed at Amy which--
-But l texted her though to said--
To meet in the room--
I can do it with Jay...
...because I thought Amy
would just drop the movie...
...if we didn't go with Jay.
-She was right. He's awesome.
-She was totally right.
Honestly, we had a guy who spoke
perfect English, that's kind of--
Just kind of--
In our heads, it would just be easier.
Honestly,
it was kind ofjust an easy--
-lt was a lazy play--
-You don't remember.
We got an extra five days
of shooting...
...because I told Amy there is no way
we could do the movie...
...in the schedule we had
with a guy who didn't speak English.
It's true, and it actually helped out
a lot ultimately and we--
And we made the right choice.
I mean, he was so funny...
...and when we read together,
it was awesome.
Let's roll, Kato.
Do you think it makes me
happy to do this, Dad?
Here, we have the music
of The White Stripes.
-Which is good music.
-Why don't you start to talk a bit...
...about we're coming
into Kato-Vision?
-Explain what your thoughts were.
-So the idea...
...is Kato can see in advance
what's going on.
I mean, l have to say, I've been
working on this project for 1 5 years.
It was set in Universal years ago.
I had a lot of idea about the fight,
to make them different.
So l came up with this idea where he
can single out some elements...
...that would be used for the fight.
And then he put them together and
computes the fighting in an instant.
On this effect,
it looks pretty awesome in 3D, yeah.
And that was-- l mean, some people
will say a case like Sherlock Holmes...
...there is always comparison
to be made, but--
Sherlock Holmes,
for anybody who didn't understand.
But-- I didn't--
Never saw Sherlock Holmes, actually.
In Sherlock Holmes, I think,
it's much more--
They describe it with words,
it's not quite as visual and....
-Did anyone see Sherlock Holmes?
-l did. Basically, Sherlock Holmes...
...he tells you
what's gonna happen before he does--
"I'll take pipe, hit that gentleman--"
-That's exactly what it is.
-Like in True Lies.
And, thank God, Kato can't speak well
enough to do that, so he had to do it.
We're about to go
into what we call Kato-Vision...
...where he can slow down time
and see what's gonna happen.
This is one of those things
Gondry explained to me and Evan...
...for a really long time,
I really had a hard time grasping it.
This thing we shot,
practically, to some degree...
...we had two sets of cars there.
Jay was running over them.
That was confusing
to a lot of people.
-And that was his--
-People just kept coming up like:
"You realise they have two of each car.
Someone's made a weird mistake."
That's the most painful moment
of the film.
-That wrench....
-See, he stretched time and space.
And there, he warps time and space,
and here he breaks time...
-...and space's kneecap.
-Every time that happens.
Behind you!
-"Behind you."
-Then there was a big discussion...
...if Britt could be strong enough
to fist the guy up.
-To fist the guy?
-No, no, sorry. l meant...
...to fistfight,
throw his fist in the face of the guy.
We kind of--
We forgot about the car right here...
...which is, you know, many, many
hours of discussion about what car--
I was saving it for the montage.
When we first started
talking about the movie...
...we had meetings
with different car companies...
...who wanted to build
today's version of Black Beauty.
And we went
through many, many designs...
...with many, many car companies.
I think one of the smartest decisions
we made...
...in the whole movie
was to revert back to the car...
-...the Chrysler lmperial.
-l couldn't believe this moment...
...where, like, we all were hoping...
...that we would end up
using the Chrysler '65 Imperial.
When Neal who--
You have been trying to push us
to do this modern design.
You say,
"Let's go to the original car."
It was such a relief.
I gotta say, my fear was that you were
gonna veto using the old car...
...because it came down to you.
No, when Amy and all of them
saw it, and they liked it as much--
They bought one car, 5000--
My fear was that Amy was gonna veto
it because we were being offered...
...tens of millions of dollars
in promotion...
...from one--
From these car companies...
-...to use their car--
-Well, they bankrupt.
After the crash, they all bankrupt,
so good for us.
We sprung a trap and just parked
the car outside Amy's office...
...told her to come and check it out.
But one of the cool things
is we got to go to Detroit...
...to GM manufacturing plant,
look at their future cars...
-...which was badass.
-And they are withholding future cars.
-They have future cars--
-l remember getting an e-mail like:
"Oh, GM's not in existence
anymore."
So l guess they're not gonna be
building the car.
Okay, then to keep--
The cop is not killed here.
I know. And we had a lot of stuff
for this. Me and Evan--
People expect us to be the ones...
...to kind of monitor the violent level
in these things...
...but they don't realise--
Don't realise we could care less.
This gets a huge laugh also,
is "the greatest night of my life."
This does get a good one.
This song was actually in the script.
This is one of my favourite songs.
This is one of the rare times where--
We totally forgot about it. "Twisting
The Night Away" by Sam Cooke.
Musicians are Booker T.
and the MG's band.
One of my favourite songs of all time.
And it was in the script,
and it disappeared.
Everyone ignored that it was in
the script, no one reads the script.
-And then months later--
-Nobody watched a storyboard either.
Then months later, they were like,
"Oh, we need a song for here."
Like, "The song that's been
in the script for four years...
...could be the one that'll work."
And it did.
Thank you, Sam Cooke.
I was going through my computer
the other day...
...and l found a draft
of The Green Hornet from 2007 .
There's an old draft
of The Green Hornet...
...where we wanted to give Kato
some background.
So we're like, "Let's put up posters
of famous Chinese musicians."
We looked up, "Who's the most
famous Asian musician?"
And it said Jay Chou.
There was a brief time where
Jay Chou was mentioned in script.
Kato says his favourite musician
was Jay Chou.
-Oh, that's funny.
-You know, even though this movie--
Turning The Green Hornet
into a movie...
...has gone on
for many, many years.
Fifteen, 20 years that they have--
This version of it
actually happened very quickly...
...in the scheme of movies being made
in Hollywood.
-lt's true.
-Probably, I guess.
From the time we met the first time,
to the time I acquired the rights--
It was like four years. ls that quick?
Four years from the time
we talked about it...
...to the time it's on the screen?
That's quick.
I don't find it specially quick--
Four years.
I mean, think about Superbad.
How long was Superbad before--?
-Ten years?
-Ten years.
-Pineapple Express was eight years.
-Another idea, but we didn't go for it--
In the time of-- l wanted to have the TV
in your room in 3D.
I thought it was good advertising
for Sony.
It's a cool idea,
but then they'd need the 3D glasses--
No, they don't need it
because ultimately...
...they can do lenticular system.
-You could have a TV without glasses.
-Hypothetically, yes.
We got our friend a 3D little camera.
Don't need glasses to look at 3D on it.
-ls that true?
-lt's crazy, yeah.
I think it's a good time for me to say
that my grandfather was president...
...of the French stereo club.
The French stereo club,
that's what Gondry just said.
I feel like the guys in 3D
actually kind of respect that.
-l know.
-l don't think it passes by lightly.
Well, l don't let it pass lightly
because l mention it quite often.
Do you understand
what I'm saying?
Getting ticket from a cop, like:
"You don't understand, officer,
my grandfather was the president--"
It's funny, guys. Here, you say 3D,
but it's confusing with CGl...
...because in French, we say 3D
for CGI, and we say stereo for 3D.
-Really?
-Yes.
-You call CGl "3D"?
-Yes.
-That totally makes sense.
-Yeah.
-What?
-But the 3D effect is really interesting.
Basically,
you have your two brain disagreeing...
...and trying to agree because
your two eyes are connected...
...to the different side of the brain.
And they try to adjust, so that's quite
what creates a third dimension.
-Hello, we're back.
-We were talking about--
We said bad stuff,
and we were censored so--
We were censored, we had to stop
the audio commentary, and we just--
But we were hoping they would
just replace our voice by beeps.
I have a concept. lf you say beep,
maybe they replace it by a bad word.
But we were the--
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
Well, what we were saying
was so grotesque...
...that they literally couldn't beep out
the specific bad words.
It was the entire--
Conceptually, they couldn't even have
what we were saying and recording.
A beep so big,
it would break the TV.
What's also interesting
is we reshot this scene...
...for some of the trailers
and commercials.
-We ended up using it in the movie.
-And whose idea was that?
Yours? To use it in the movie?
Oh, well, that's right.
No, because it looked better
for the commercial...
-...than it did for the movie.
-l know.
-There was something about--
-lt's one of the way I learned...
...to put my ego in my pocket.
Guy walked in...
...and changed the direction
for the trailer.
I was like, "You don't do that
to a French director."
Then, "Whose idea was that? Well,
actually, that's better. We'll use it."
Now this group of people, like,
these guys and the ladies here...
-So good.
-...did a lot of improv in the movie.
And made these scenes
much better.
They made a lot out of nothing
with just looks...
...and lifts of their eyebrows,
and such.
And the translite we were talking
about, we had a day translite...
...and now there's a night translite
in the background.
Translite's the giant backdrop
that makes the cityscape.
Translite for giant backdrop.
Cityscape.
--vandalising business?
I get it.
Listen, let's not blow this thing
out of proportion.
I will blow this guy
in any proportion l like.
This is my...
...newspaper, Axford, and l want
this man on the front page of it.
I want him on the webpage.
I want you to blog about him.
We shot this-- These scenes--
All these scenes of The Sentinel...
...at the very beginning of the movie.
We started here, so it was actually--
We're there at beginning and end,
kind of book-ended it.
That's right. But wait,
didn't we destroy The Sentinel?
At the beginning,
or waited to come back?
-No, we waited to destroy it.
-Did we?
We waited to make sure
we wouldn't have to redo any.
Yes, because when it was destroyed,
it was really destroyed.
How long was the shoot?
Anyone remember?
-lt was 79 days.
-Yeah, I think it was 80 days.
-Seventy-nine days.
-Which is weird, because I'm used to--
After shooting, I have the baby-blues
effect when you get depressed.
But l had it during the film, it was
sorrow. After we destroyed the set...
...and we started all the scene
in your house, Seth--
In Britt's house,
I got-- l was in pieces.
It was like already--
You were ready for it to be--
Well, between 80 days and then
we had, l think, another 40 days...
...or so of second unit.
It was a very long shoot.
We were lucky that we actually got
to shoot this movie in Los Angeles.
-Where were they trying to take us?
-Well, we had--
Watching the movie,
we could be anywhere.
Only difference is that
at that time of year...
...we would've been shooting
in snow or cold.
True. That's definitely true.
So it wouldn't have been
a blue-sky movie.
It's true.
It's much nicer that it's a very nice,
sunny-looking movie.
But we could've shot it anywhere and
probably saved 1 5, 20 million dollars.
But instead,
we all got to sleep in our own beds.
-Exactly.
-We would have all lost our minds...
...if we couldn't have gone home.
Around day 65,
one of us would've killed the other.
It would've been brutal.
Or we all would've made love.
That's what would happen.
Turned on each other sexually.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
This was awesome
when we shot this scene.
They actually got this--
We shot in the printing-press room.
They got their printing-press machines
to print Green Hornet newspapers.
That was the only way to get all these
newspapers coming out of machine.
A noisy place
when those machines are running.
-Oh, my goodness, it was so noisy.
-l ruined two pairs of shoes.
Because there's so much ink...
...on the ground there that
you can never get it off your shoes.
-Yeah, true.
-lt was unbelievable.
That room was dangerous-seeming.
I remember, we were just running
around there like lunatics.
-lt looks like a battleship.
-Yeah, it's awesome.
It really feels like they could've put
more effort into the safety precautions.
And this was another scene
that we did a little reshoot on.
That's one year later, actually.
Now, me and Evan as writers,
I will say, like, we don't give--
You know, we feel like it's okay...
...to kind of throw things at people
at the last second.
And l will say Christoph
was not a big fan, in general.
-He liked having a plan.
-He liked having a plan.
Me and Evan like
going by the seat of our pants.
Well, we like to have a plan,
and then....
And then divert from that plan.
And he yelled at me and Evan a lot,
I will say, and....
Really, he did?
Things like, "lt would be nice
to have a script for once."
That was something said
a couple times.
-l think this is just actor insecurity.
-Maybe. l hope so.
You have to take it, and you--
I don't know.
Different actors, I think, just like to--
I think people actually like to prepare
to some degree also.
Jim Carrey,
when I did Eternal Sunshine...
...he yelled at me, and then after,
he was very thankful.
So sometimes they don't see it,
why we're doing those things.
-Yeah.
-Okay, here.
That was a big entrance of Cameron
in the movie.
Who is the easiest-going person
to work with, ever.
It's true. She was lovely.
It's a pleasure
to have some women around.
This movie
was a real sausage party.
I gotta disagree,
sausage party all day long.
I like it.
I would sometimes just like to look out
and count how many testicles.
Is that--? Is that like something
for your next movie?
Is that what you're trying
to get in there?
Sausage Party will be out in theatres
by the time people listen to this audio.
So to find out how many testicle,
you multiply the number...
...of people by two, and then
you subtract the number of women?
Yeah. And I subtract five random--
Assuming five random
crew members only have one ball.
I had a dream of those--
I had a dream last night...
...l lost a testicle.
-Really?
-l had an operation.
-Why do l dream like that?
-That's so weird.
And what's the back-story
to Cameron Diaz in this movie?
-You guys remember?
-Back-story is l'm not famous enough.
People thought that in order
to have a movie this expensive...
...we need more people in it that could
support this budget and draw people.
And we thought, well, if we have
to get someone who's famous...
...Cameron Diaz is really awesome.
Maybe she'll do it.
And she did it. l remember
me and Gondry went out...
...to go meet her and--
At the Chateau Marmont.
And we had dinner with her,
or drinks.
And l'm, like-- I've never felt cooler
in my entire life...
...than sitting at a bar
with Cameron Diaz. lt was awesome.
She's a special woman.
She came to my house to deliver notes
while l was having a party.
Oh, yeah. He's having a huge party.
And l was like, "You gotta know
I am completely trashed right now."
I hid from her
because l was way too drunk.
She don't want to kiss Kato.
That was the note.
-Yeah, that's a good note.
-That's a good one.
I have to say, yeah,
she, like, really helped us...
...kind of differentiate
the female role...
...from how they generally are
in these movies, I think.
-And she did-- Yeah, like, it was--
-She was very adamant about it.
And then I got--
I write a comment on the Net.
For one, it was good, and it was
attributed to me, that the hero--
In the superhero movie
was not getting the girl.
They say,
"Thanks, Gondry, for that."
Little do they know
it's Cameron Diaz's refusal...
...to kiss me or Jay that led to that.
And she was shooting another movie
when we were doing this.
-She was doing Knight and Day.
-Yeah, so we only had...
...a total of nine days with her.
Yeah. lt's true.
So why is the concept of her character
is that she's the brain?
So she find out
what the Green Hornet is doing.
Yeah, we thought it was funny if we
knew nothing about any of this stuff...
...and the writing, you know.
Me and Evan met with Shane Black.
He's one of our favourite writers
in the entire world.
-He wrote Lethal Weapon.
-Wrote Lethal Weapon and--
-Monster Squad?
-He wrote Monster Squad.
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
and Long Kiss Goodnight.
-Last Boy Scout.
-Last Boy Scout.
And he's just amazing.
He was nice to sit down
with me and Evan a bunch of times...
...and kind of talk about the script
and his--
The best thing he said to us...
...was to just kind of look
at how these movies normally are...
...and just try to do the exact opposite
of what they normally do.
And normally, the woman...
...is kind of the dumbest character
in the movie, generally...
...who kind of is the least aware
of the mechanics of the situation.
It would be funny if Cameron was
the smartest person in the movie...
...and the only one who was really
equipped to tell us what to do, really...
...and who understood
how crime worked.
And that was
where that idea came from.
Behind there where they're sitting right
now is the secret bar that--
Was cut out of the movie, right?
-We should do a sequence--
-Not in at any juncture?
-No.
-No.
Because we don't have Edward James
come out of the bar.
There was a part
where he was hiding.
That whole bookcase is a bar,
the biggest secret bar in the universe.
We should do a sequence and bonus
with what's attributed to the minibar.
It's true. We could've shot
a whole movie in that minibar.
-l just--
-lt's the first scene we shot here.
-That's a beautiful set.
-This was the second day of filming...
...or the first day of filming.
-This was the first day of filming.
-This scene's one of the longest ever.
And we cut it down, and I think
we were all kind of worried...
-...about this scene early on--
-lt was super long.
We couldn't understand
how to make it shorter.
Cameron was nice enough--
I think the idea where I was asking her
why someone her age...
...getting a job came up
when we were improvising...
...one day maybe in the rehearsal,
and l just went for it.
I think I was just like,
"Here goes nothing." And l--
This is the scene we shot
for the trailer.
-Yeah.
-And now, it's in the movie.
I wrote this, remember? Me and Evan.
We wrote this for the trailer...
...because we were worried
how they'd market the movie...
...for no reason, whatsoever...
...so we wrote this scene,
hopefully to kind of explain the story...
And we realised it explained the story
better than any scene we had.
And we needed a step here
for the decision to make the car.
Into the montage.
It worked perfectly.
And there's a great song
of The White Stripes.
-Yeah.
-We had a Daft Punk song in here...
...and l think
we couldn't get this song--
Why wouldn't Daft Punk
clear that song, Gondry?
Personal reason
between Thomas and I.
And l admire Thomas
and l understand his reason. lt's--
That's right.
You're very diplomatic about that.
-Well, it's complicated.
-lt is complicated.
-But this song, l think, works better.
-l do too.
It's funny because l was asked
to do a remix with--
Two remix, Jim Jarmusch and l.
On my remix, we're adding
a motorbike sound to this.
-To this song?
-Yeah.
Well, that's funny. That's like Kato.
-Exactly.
-Yeah. This is a rad montage.
This is my favourite
of these types of movies.
It's where you see people
build the shit.
And l was excited
to have this kind of montage.
No, the research montage
is our best.
Research montage might be
the greatest.
We used to have girls making out
in the background.
-Yeah.
-Yeah, a Neal Moritz moment.
It's not on-screen,
didn't mean it didn't happen.
This was one of-- This was
a pretty cool day, l have to say.
I felt like that hot tub was for me.
That was fun.
That car was awesome.
That little half-car thing
with the things.
This was a good idea, Gondry.
That's your idea, right?
To have bullets bounce off
the window.
-l guess, maybe.
-lt was Jeff lmada's idea.
Our fight choreographer.
It might have been his idea.
No, it's mine.
But, yeah, it's classic.
But we-- Some scenes
don't want to be avoided.
-lt's true. I like the building montage.
-They're a cliché for a reason.
Exactly. There's some--
This was a cool shot.
-Yeah, this is a good idea.
-Motion-control shot.
The only use of motion control
in the whole movie.
This is a nice laugh right here.
I know. People....
This and this Zephyr,
that's the original Black Beauty...
-...from the original series.
-From, I believe, 1 721 .
Yeah, from 1 721 .
And that's a nod
for big Green Hornet fans right there.
-That's a cool shot.
-This is a purely--
This is a total visual-effects shot.
That car is not real.
Can we be honest?
How Neal and l fought you
to get this floor to turn around.
-lt's in every--
-You hated this idea.
-l don't remember that.
-You hated it.
-l think me and Evan just totally--
-And then I said to Seth--
Well, l think it was a trade.
I think I got you to agree to this...
-...for him to agree to sell--
-"Gangsta's Paradise."
I'd like to say
you thought "Gangsta's Paradise"...
...was the stupidest thing
in the world.
How'd you think
"Gangsta's Paradise" wouldn't work?
Wait. What about the gate that opens
right there we just passed?
I thought that was madness.
I thought that gate was cool.
I like the car gate.
It was a big fight. They trick me and
say, "Can the gate slide on the side?"
-"No, no, it has to break like an egg."
-Yeah. It's cool.
But l remember--
I actually remember, Evan...
...that we were looking
for a lot more logic.
We're like,
"When did he build this thing?"
Well, then, Neal said,
"Sometimes cool wins over logic."
One of the best Neal Moritz quotes
of all time.
"There's logic and there's cool.
And cool wins every time."
And "whirly-dirly." l don't remember
ever saying those things.
-You've said both those things.
-No, the best time--
"Gangsta's Paradise,"
the whole time we were shooting...
...how much did you hate it?
Like, "Stupid--"
-He was like, "Okay, shoot it."
-Yeah, he was just--
And every time we'd come back,
watch replay and play it back...
...you'd be like,
"I don't think it's funny."
This movie has been
a learning experience for me...
...about how to put my ego
in my ass, basically.
We'll get to that point later on.
Well, here, for this part,
I had a great idea...
...we're gonna do it for the sequel.
It's like you pull a blue screen
behind you...
...and you talk, like, in front
of your desk in your office.
-Video conference.
-l remember.
And then Kato makes sharp turn
and you get--
You move like the gravitation
pull you on the side.
-The fax machine in the car.
-The fax machine made it.
That's one of those things that's so
weird, and no one noticed it's weird.
I got an e-mail two weeks ago,
someone was like:
"Fax machine in the car? Really?
Are we really doing that?"
Yeah, we're doing it.
My girlfriend immediately was like,
"So, what's up with the fax machine?"
Why couldn't you do it?
Have cellular phones--
-l know. l think--
-But l mean, you could do it, but--
Why wouldn't they have
other things?
Here's one of the biggest laughs
of the movie.
-Yeah.
-Right here.
-And that's like a total ADR line, right?
-That's mine.
That was something-- Yeah.
That was an Evan line. Good job.
This we filmed in an incredibly
dangerous neighbourhood.
The first day we shot, we heard--
Right here you can see
at the end of that block right there.
-Was a murder.
-Yeah.
-The guy didn't die.
-The guy lived.
-He got shot in the head.
-l think he got his ears sliced also.
We had police cars
race right through the set.
Oh, yeah. It was crazy.
Well, we were all standing there.
Yeah, you see the police car there.
And you just hear:
-"l didn't know we were rolling."
-"l didn't know we're shooting guns."
We're like,
"Shit, that was real guns."
-We just kept working.
-Yeah, we kept working.
And what sucked was that was, like,
the first of five nights we were there.
On this sequence,
if you remember...
...l had storyboarded it
right before to get the job actually.
-Oh, yeah. That's right.
-lt's exactly the way it was.
Really similar. This whole arm.
You storyboarded all this, right?
-The arm and the door and all that.
-Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Actually, that was really similar.
It's very satisfactory when you think of
something, and they actually happen.
-Yeah, exactly, yeah.
-There's one thing that bugs me...
...is you don't see the bullet bouncing
from the windshield.
That's the reason
why there is broken glass falling.
You kind of see it a little bit.
But this scene ultimately
kind of became very different--
We pulled this out of our ass a bit.
This Kato-Vision,
you pulled out of your ass.
-lt's really good.
-Yeah. And it's good.
-This is awesome.
-lt's cool, it does the opposite...
-...of the previous Kato fight.
-lt's one big shot. This thing's rad.
-This turned out really good.
-He jumped on the guy...
...who is in slow-motion.
-Nice.
-That's good. That was good.
I like that. "Eat my foot, bitch."
Added all that shit.
I don't know about him
getting kicked in the balls.
I don't know if l get that either.
That was in--
Now, l can't believe
we'd get away with that.
We get away with that. Come on.
Let's not talk about it.
-But--
-And look like he's pulling--
You're pulling the guy who is--
That's the guy at the window.
-lt's an editorial cheat.
-That's right. lt is a cheat.
It doesn't matter, though.
It totally works.
It's amazing
what you can really get away with.
-Yeah.
-When they like the characters--
If they didn't like the characters,
they would've called us on that.
We shot my half of this scene a month
and a half after we shot that shot.
Like, this shot and the other shot
are shot totally at different times.
-We changed a lot with ADR.
-Edward Furlong.
Here's Michel's favourite character
in the movie.
-Yeah, and l'm glad we have him.
-l don't even know you--
-Were you here when we shot this?
-l left just before you did your line.
-lt was the second-unit shots.
-l directed this.
We should've cut the second half
of this scene.
-l think it's funny.
-l think it's great.
You at home can decide
if we were wrong or not.
See, now l would have cut it, right--
-No, this sentence.
-After here.
Okay,
I'm gonna point to the sentence.
--sends his regards.
-Here.
-Neal wanted to cut here.
-Neal wanted to cut here. But we--
-Right there.
"You broke my lab, man."
And this--
The payoff is what's great.
It doesn't get a laugh. That's okay.
-lt's okay. They don't--
-lt's a character scene.
-We need to get--
-Look at the mismatch here.
Fire coming out front,
no fire coming out.
-Right. But you don't notice.
-No.
-On the floor.
-Built a car with a flamethrower.
In reference to Back to the Future,
my favourite movie.
That's right. We filmed that
in the weirdest place ever.
That was an abandoned military base.
Remember that? That was horrifying.
It's very-- It seems very toxic.
Yeah. lt was really creepy.
-We added a few lines here.
-We did. Some of this--
This is reshot. We just made that wall
behind Christoph again.
We don't care. We'll tell you
that we reshot some stuff.
-We're the only ones who will admit it.
-There's a French movie, famous...
...Mr. Hulot's Holiday when
the director, Jacques Tati reshot--
He shot it in 1 952 or something...
...and then he saw Jaws in '78,
and he reshot a scene...
...to add to his movie in 1 970....
-Really?
-That's what, like--
The crazy part
is it made the movie worse.
Yeah, exactly.
-And ever since then it was a failure.
-No.
Edward Furlong crossed the line.
When I was a kid, Edward Furlong
was the baddest-ass mother out there.
I mean, remember in Terminator 2,
he, like, rides a motorcycle and stuff?
-Dirt bike.
-Oh, yeah, dirt bike.
-Hacking ATMs. He don't give a damn.
-Terminator 2 holds up.
I think Terminator 2
is the greatest movie ever made.
Well, after Robocop.
-Maybe. Robocop's awesome.
-Robocop is pretty badass.
But Terminator 2, the production,
like, the effects--
Like, if you released it today,
I don't think anyone would flinch.
Yeah. But what I like in Robocop,
it's uncompromising.
-lt doesn't-- lt's not sentimental.
-Yeah. It's true.
-So this montage about to happen...
-Yes.
...of us driving around, kicking ass,
was totally made from--
-lt wasn't in the script.
-Evan Henke come up with that?
-lt was totally--
-Well, he'd edited it but the-- l had--
You came up with the idea.
It was comprised of stuff we cut out
of our other car chases.
Yeah, it was great.
We felt like we needed to see the
escalation of the Green Hornet and--
It helped the movie so much.
It was such-- lt really helped a lot.
And the music is great.
Here comes one of my favourite lines
in the whole movie.
When he said--
When you leave this scene.
-"Britt Reid outro?"
-"Britt Reid outro."
But it doesn't get a laugh.
But it doesn't matter.
It's like the line:
"Turn this journal into a discotheque,"
which is my line.
I've seen people laugh at that.
I love that line.
That's my favourite joke line of yours.
-Really?
-l find "discotheque" very funny.
"Britt Reid outro" doesn't have
to get a laugh.
It's introducing the next moment.
-l guess so.
-That's true.
And Daniel Vertlieb
up on the wall, who is our friend.
-That's our friend.
-Quite the story to Daniel Vertlieb.
We put all our real friends' names
in Superbad...
...and the one mentioned the most
was our real-life friend, Dan Vertlieb.
And slowly but surely, we edited it
out of the movie and didn't realise it.
He told all his friends he was in this
movie with our other friends' names.
-We've been trying to get that name--
-Oh, no, that's yours. That's--
That's my assistant,
Theodore Bressman...
...playing my real friend,
Daniel Vertlieb.
-ln a photo.
-And there was a moment...
...where it looked
like Daniel Vertlieb...
...who we wrote to be
an intrinsic part of the film...
...that could not be removed,
was gonna get taken out.
What l'll say is we're only over budget
on this movie on one thing...
...and that was catering, because Seth
and Evan have so many friends.
No, that's Seth's parents.
-They're always eating at the kitchen.
-They would always come.
They would eat our catering.
They would eat our craft service.
-Take bags of food home.
-You know what you're leaving out?
They'd raise spirits.
They bring laughter.
-You can't put a price on that.
-That's true.
Yeah, this is all just manufactured
for the purpose of entertainment.
And this was--
How we did this movie was kind of--
-And this robot, l designed this robot.
-Nice.
Everybody was laughing at me
when they--
-Which robot?
-Oh, no.
-The one Kato--
-Seth and I were down with the robot...
-...from square one.
-lt's like a punching bag.
Go with the robot, call it the robot.
Yeah, this song has been a point
of contention, l'll be honest, right?
-But majority rules.
-Majority rules.
-l like this song very much.
-Neal and Michel like the song.
And l am not bored.
Now, a week ago,
the studio tried to convince us...
...that we should change high-fiving
after destroying that cop car...
...but we were on such a high
at that time.
You know why Van Halen
bothers me?
The reason why it's okay
is it tells the audience...
...like, don't take this montage
too seriously.
And that woman there is the girlfriend
of the mayor of Los Angeles.
Who knows where they're at now?
-Exactly. That's the girl that he--
-That is his girlfriend.
That's his girlfriend. And we actually
filmed in the mayor's office.
David Harbour's--
Scanlon's office in this movie...
-...is Mayor Villaraigosa's office.
-And that's a set right there.
-No, that's real.
-No, this one is-- That's real.
That's real. This is the set.
-The outside part is real.
-Outside was real at the pool.
-But l thought we had outside at the--
-We did have it, but we didn't use it.
Just to smash out of the window.
-l know. We shot that in the actual--
-God, I thought--
There is very good acting
in this scene.
-Seth, very good job.
-Thank you. lt's my bread and butter.
This is just, you know, acting
like l'm in love with another dude.
No, it's more than that. I mean,
there is a gradual disappointment.
This scene could've been stupid too,
and it really is one of the--
Gets the biggest laughs in the movie.
This and the following scene.
This is the scene
where the audience realises...
...that we're making it about the fact
that I suck and he's awesome.
It hasn't really been about that
until this scene.
Yeah, this scene
could be you kicking ass...
...and you two ascending
to hero-ness.
Exactly. But it's the scene
where you realise Kato knows...
...that l'm not good at this.
And they're happy to see that, I think.
-Because I'm not.
-l think you see how Jay...
...with his limited English,
really pulled it.
He's a great actor, man.
-No, he's a great actor.
-He pulled it out of his ass.
It was awesome.
It was hard to do this not knowing
how the green gas would look.
-All that green gas--
-That was probably my biggest worry.
-Yeah.
-That the gas would look ridiculous.
-Looks pretty good.
-l'm pretty happy.
There's a few times
where it's a little dodgy.
-Yeah.
-But it's mostly--
-You think that wouldn't be the case?
-No, any time you're doing a CG--
I think the good thing
is the gas, we made it solid--
That it hides sometime
bad performance of some actor.
Yeah, exactly, yeah.
-l love that little addition to this.
-That was a good joke on the--
We had some joke when some people
would cough and put out--
You would see the smoke
when they cough, but we didn't use it.
You guys have to hold the fort.
I have to pee.
-Okay--
-Just keep trucking, dudes.
-This diaper thing--
-Wanna take over for me a bit?
-No?
-Go ahead, you can jump in.
-Me and Evan felt strongly about this.
-Co-producer, Raffi Adlan.
Raffi Adlan will be taking over
for the next five minutes.
You guys thought this diaper
thing was pretty stupid, right?
We kind of had to push this through.
No, not me.
-l like the diaper.
-You like the--?
My question is,
was that a real diaper?
It was a real diaper that I wore,
and l actually pooed in it on all day.
-How often are you wearing a diaper?
-We should auction it off.
We should.
You're not wearing a diaper very often.
Maybe you can sell it
in vending machine in Japan.
So Raffi is joining us now. Raffi is
a co-producer. He worked with Michel.
Yeah, he's the one who convinced me
to go embark on this project...
...because he wanted
to work on a big movie.
Yeah.
And he got his way.
And here's three...
...of the probably 25 Black Beauties
we had and destroyed in this movie.
Well, some people didn't have
a problem, but l had--
Some of the other probably
let the car get destroyed...
...and then there's another car
coming.
And you had to return many cars
for the original--
Yeah,
that was one of our original ideas.
Me and Evan, l remember,
is we thought, like--
In these movies, there's always only
one car, it's so precious and valuable.
But if you're rich,
you'd just build a ton of them.
And we actually, at one point,
had an idea for one chase...
...where, throughout one car chase,
they go through three or four cars.
And they have them stashed,
like, all over the city, basically.
-lf we do another one--
-l think, Raffi, you should--
-Let us hear your voice.
-You wanna hear my voice?
Well, Raffi, our 3D process
became so complicated...
...that Raffi became one of the heads
of our 3D conversion process.
How's that going so far?
Where we at with that?
-Where are we at with that?
-We're on schedule as of today.
This is actually the--
Today is actually the first day
we're on schedule in six months.
-So just for the record--
-We're locking--
-lt's November 22nd, 201 0.
-We're locking--
The 3D truck has arrived.
Yeah, the 3D truck just got here,
and it....
And l just, Saturday, went to see
one of the flashbacks...
...of Britt Reid in 3D,
and it is awesome.
-l'm excited.
-We're gonna see reel one and two...
-...tomorrow or Wednesday.
-Twenty-ninth.
-l'm excited about it.
-We seeing anything today?
We are.
-The best part--
-We are seeing today?
-Thought that was off the schedule.
-We're seeing something.
-Some new stuff--?
-Oh, here we did 20 takes...
-...to get that in the box.
-Twenty? Twenty is conservative.
-That took 20 minutes.
-But it's not special effect.
It was done for real.
If you can believe that,
that was real.
That doesn't get a very good laugh.
-l know.
-lt was kind of a waste of time.
In retrospect, we should've
shut that down a lot earlier.
You never know in advance...
...because then if you become
conservative on every shot...
...then you don't do anything.
I wish we'd spent more time on this
and gotten funnier stuff.
I think we ADR'd some of this
to make it a little better.
-But it's not bad.
-lt's great.
I have to say, some of-- Although
Stephen Chow proved himself...
...to be a little difficult to work with
at times, he--
Some of his ideas worked their way
into the movie and are still there.
And the idea
that Kato makes the coffee...
...and that's how me and Kato
bond...
...was all Stephen Chow's idea.
It's true, yeah.
He said it was a movie about coffee.
And this idea, the idea that, like,
I ask him to make coffee...
.....and Kato threatens to beat the shit
out of me, was also Chow's idea.
-Oh, I see--
-Because--
Because we kind of thought it'd be
funnier if there was a slow build.
He's, "No, the second you ask him
to do it, he should threaten to kill you."
I like Kato in this shot.
He's really.... He's very authentic.
We shot that in, like, 1 0 minutes
with two cameras.
And this place was very small.
And people thought it would be really
crazy to do it with two cameras...
...because the side of the cabinet--
It's hiding, but l think it looks good.
This was a really difficult day.
You remember this?
-Thank to Neal...
-l'll never forget.
...who made us shoot
with the most expensive car.
We could not do the cool stuff,
which is make the car go crazy...
...or attach the camera to the car.
It was too expensive.
-Thanks to Neal as well, there were--
-And then--
A beautiful curtain
that blocks the view behind the car.
I closed the curtains, I'll be honest.
By mistake.
It looks like a coroner's car.
But you lost your shit that day,
Gondry.
Yeah, l was furious. No, seriously.
You blow up half of Los Angeles,
3D cost a fortune...
...then the car cannot go
more than 30 mile per hour...
...so it was ridiculous.
What you've learned
through this experience...
...is that you should never walk off
the set during the middle of the day.
I-- That was not this day
I walked off the set.
-That was one of the two days.
-That was another day.
-But you--
-By the way--
You spazzed at everyone so hard
that I think it discouraged people a bit.
-Seth, do you have that picture?
-l do have that.
Of me walking away? My girlfriend
and her mom was eating at lunch--
No, it's a picture of, like-- It's, like,
a giant wide picture of Sony Studios...
...and you're like one--
Like one tiny little speck in it.
Well, as a writer, as a director, we're
completely ignored at this moment...
...and many other occasion.
But l didn't have my ego
in my ass at this time.
Your ego was not yet placed
inside your ass.
It was still in my balls.
This scene was a--
You know, music helped.
Well, you don't like this scene
because you're not in it.
No, well, the story got really long,
actually, right?
There was explanation as to--
This thing where her husband
cheated, and we explained all that.
We knew from day one that this
would never make it to the editing.
But as a writer,
you wanted to see it shot--
It's true. l'll agree.
-Sometimes, it's worth a shot.
-l'm gonna sign back off here.
-Thanks, Raffi.
-Urination break is over, but enjoy.
-Thanks, Raffi Adlan.
-Thanks, Raf.
Evan, you gotta pick it up
while l eat a bagel.
And, guys, l'm gonna bid farewell.
I have to go try
and get another movie made.
-Really?
-Yeah.
I'm going to a meeting
on 21 Jump Street.
I'm gonna plug 21 Jump Street
for a second.
-With Jonah.
-Starring your friend, Jonah.
If it gets made, see it.
If it ever gets made, see it.
-How's Jonah doing?
-Jonah's doing great, buddy.
-ls he back in L.A. now?
-No, he's in New York.
Working on a David Green movie.
This was a scene where
we added a couple new lines to it.
It made the scene better, though
the scene is almost intact as it was.
The scene was pretty good
to begin with, this one.
The only stuff we added
is the stuff about Kim.
Thought it'd be funny--
See you, Neal. Thanks for joining.
-Thank you, guys.
-Bye, Neal.
-See you on the sequel.
-Exactly.
We thought it'd be funny if
his really good friend, Kim, was there.
Raffi's gonna fill in for Neal
and just sit here.
-Nice.
-Add colour commentary.
-Why not? Exactly.
-Faster.
Well, so talk quickly
about Chili and Popeye.
Yeah, that guy, Chad Coleman,
is from The Wire...
...which is one of my favourite shows
ever.
And we thought it would be badass
to have him.
He auditioned,
it was awesome, and--
He was supposed to be part of
Nicolas Cage-- A Rasta gang member.
That's right, actually.
Here's what's funny.
Nicolas Cage
was doing a Jamaican--
I totally forgot about that, actually.
Nicolas Cage
was doing a Jamaican dude.
We actually cast him
as a Jamaican dude.
We cast this actual Jamaican guy...
-...named Perfect, right? Mr. Perfect.
-"Hornet."
"Green Hornet." This guy sent
an audition tape from Jamaica.
It was actually amazing.
Like, this guy was incredible.
Unfortunately, we couldn't hire him,
but we were like:
"Yeah, maybe we can keep Chad, and
tell him not to do a Jamaican accent."
But l think it wasn't until he showed up
on set...
...and saw Christoph,
that we were like:
"Oh, you're not being a Jamaican guy.
We completely rewrote everything."
-"We forgot to tell you."
-l think with Chad and Jamie Harris--
I think we kind of--
I just wish we could've done more.
-They're both great actors.
-Yeah.
We didn't get enough of them
in there.
I think they make
a pretty good impression.
Well, it's a movie about Kato and you,
so l think it's-- You can't expect--
I remember one thing you said
to Nicolas Cage during our meeting.
And l couldn't believe you said that.
Nicolas was saying...
...that his character
was not, like, really developed.
You said, "Sorry, we can't.
We don't have time in a super movie
to develop secondary character."
How rudest can it be?
I don't remember saying that,
but I guess-- And it's not true at all.
You can develop the secondary
characters well if you want.
I always-- l was-- Again,
to come back to a complaint he had.
Yeah, that's really funny.
I just realised this, though.
If someone wants
to get a movie made...
...write a Jamaican bad guy
and bring it to Nicolas Cage.
Honestly, if you're listening,
and you have a movie that could...
...in any way, fathomably support
the role of a white Jamaican guy...
...l'd write that movie, send it out,
Nicolas Cage will star in it.
You'll get your movie made.
He's a bankable actor.
And if it works in the context
of the story, it could be amazing.
--when you corner a hornet?
You get stung.
"You get stung."
What does that mean?
We're getting into the industrial lot,
I'm gonna get beeped on this one.
Get the button ready. This was a ****
to shoot this whole thing.
-Yeah.
-We had to go back a few times.
Gondry, you should've planned
this better, l'll be honest.
-We should've previs'd this.
-Oh, you guy are so unfair to--
We should've previs'd.
Come on. Come on.
We were all against the previs.
Every time we do the previs-- I have
to explain what previs is. It's when--
It's really like an animatronic version
of the scene.
-lt looks stupid.
-lt does.
But anyway, I had to lobby you
for months and months...
...to accept you
to get the car buried.
-lt's one of the finest moments.
-You're right, l'll give you that.
Explain the idea that you had
with this cement pouring.
Yeah, l wanted you to be covered in
cement, and when you fight after that...
...you have big block of cement
on your limbs.
Kato would hit someone and break a
piece of cement attached to his arm--
-lt was just like superhero fight.
-Kind of a cool idea also.
You wanted there to be a bubble.
You wanted to form a huge bubble,
and then pop, kind of.
No, that was in the beginning
with the two suitcase. I wanted two--
-Well, that was the phone bomb.
-Yeah.
No, but here,
you wanted the cement to come in.
And then when we blew it up, a bubble
came and pops all over the place.
-My favourite--
-But this was awesome, l have to say.
-lt's a good idea.
-Crazy thing about this with the hole--
It's a good plan,
that's the thing, in the end...
...as to how you would get rid of a car
loaded up with missiles.
And it was shot
in six different chunks?
Yeah, it was shot
in a lot of different portions.
There's one part
where Seth and Jay are on, like, a--
We are not in an actual hole there,
obviously.
What would you call the device
they had the car on?
-lt was a Pettibone, they called it.
-The Pettibone.
It's a giant forklift that they, like,
strap the car to, essentially...
...and would raise it from a vertical
to horizontal position.
Seemed really dangerous
and scary.
I remember Jay sitting up there--
So who can mention the Mythbuster
test that we got busted on this one?
Yeah,
we did a Mythbusters episode.
Apparently, this is complete bullshit.
And what you're gonna see
is the real bulldozer falling on the car.
Not taking off, of course.
This is CGI, when it falls on the car,
it's a real one.
Yeah, so that's a good CG shot.
That's fake.
-Here, after, that's a real one.
-We dropped a bulldozer on a Jag.
-Like from 30 or, like, 1 00 feet high.
-One of the coolest moments.
-You could, like, feel it. It was crazy.
-We added the arm of--
We added the arm because
you forgot that Chili was in there.
Then we added the sound of the watch
to make sure we watch the arm.
That you really noticed the arm,
which was a great idea.
I will say the Mythbusters end result
looked very much like our end result...
-...of the Black Beauty.
-lt actually looked very similar.
-The hole looked similar.
-Just the living through it--
-Yeah, exactly.
-That never would happen.
Okay, well, you guys say
I wasn't unprepared on this shoot.
-l didn't say it.
-l was giving you a hard time.
-l was just screwing with you.
-l would--
The truth is, l was super prepared...
...but Neal arrived
and screw me completely over.
-lt's true. I remember at the last--
-Every decision l was making.
I remember the last second,
all this stuff got changed.
Then this we kind of re-did
halfway through, the idea...
...of the cement truck turning around,
it's cool in the end.
And they removed with computers,
but the stunt guys made a whole rig...
...below that cement truck
to allow it to do that.
It was so well done.
The little side wheels
would come at the right moment...
...with compressed air,
and make the truck move sideways.
-A little third wheel or a fifth wheel.
-Kind of like a shopping cart.
Man, this--
This shot is much more expensive
than it looks.
We destroyed a camera
at one point doing that shot.
And that's a totally CG barrel, which
is pretty impressive-looking, l think.
-l think that's Jamie Dixon.
-Jamie Dixon.
-The man.
-Jamie "Great White" Dixon.
-Great White.
-Looks like a beaver...
...works like a meter.
And works like a shark.
"Looks like a beaver." He doesn't....
So inside of this car was, initially,
a stunt man, who is just--
You'd not even see the taxi driver.
Well, outside, he looked cooler.
I said,
"Let's keep him for more moment."
And he turned out to be the worst
enemy of Christoph Waltz on the set.
So because he was present
in every scene, and he was like--
He always try to be
in front of the camera...
...so we gave him a good death.
The guy that gets crushed
by the half car.
It's a pretty good death in the end.
So here comes a big friendship
breakdown and a big fight.
I just-- ln the last shot,
was that a picture of your mother?
Yeah, l think there was one.
We're not partners.
This is-- Well, actually--
I think if you went back
to the very first draft of the scene...
...me and Evan ever--
The first draft of the script we wrote--
This scene was, probably,
pretty much identical in that draft.
Yeah, and I have to say, one time,
one of the executive of this say:
"Okay, this is going for all--
On and on forever.
Let's cut the scene."
And Neal said, "lt's too late."
He said, "No, it's my favourite part.
We're not cutting one word."
And he really fought for that.
No, he totally did.
And l think the fight--
When me and Evan
did Pineapple Express...
...we have this fight where me
and Franco and Danny beat the shit...
-...out of each other in this house.
-Awesome.
And we kind of destroy it all, and
we just had so much fun doing that.
We thought it'd be fun
to try to get kind of--
To try to beat that fight in some way
and try to do, like--
It's a bigger room,
we destroyed more stuff.
Think it goes on a little bit longer.
I remember we showed it
to our fight choreographer...
...Pineapple Express scene, we're:
"It has to be better than this.
It has to destroy more stuff."
Yeah, and he was very smart to use
every possible corner of the room.
If you look, you guys go in a perfect
square. You go in every corner.
Yeah, we really do. l mean, it really--
The choreography of it.
Jeff Imada,
who did all the Bourne films...
...did an amazing job
with the fight choreography.
You interact
with every piece of equipment--
We hit the table, the foosball table...
...the carpet, the window,
and the motorcycle, fridge.
I mean, he really did a great job...
...at integrating all the stuff in the room
and--
Some stuff we thought was stupid,
like the motorbike...
...we didn't think it was funny,
but then it's awesome.
I remember the motorbike. I insisted
we put it in the building montage.
But now it's not in there anymore.
Because-- Sometime we think we need
to justify a scene, but it doesn't matter.
We all learned that things
are a little dumber than not.
And that's okay.
"Sacked you like a bitch"
is a ridiculous thing.
This is one of my favourite additions
of yours, Gondry.
-The foosball, a great idea, Gondry.
-Thank you.
-You weren't sure--
-l wasn't sure when we did it...
-...I'll be honest.
-Really?
-This stunt, in the first cuts--
-And he yells:
-"Street Fighter" shoutout.
-Guys in the sound booth....
-That's one of the best part right here.
-This is the best joke.
-We're just congratulating ourselves.
-"l'd like to see you try."
Stop commentary for two seconds
as we talk about...
-...how awesome we are for a minute.
-lt reminds me of French comedies.
-Like, really, comedy meets action.
-You see, Santana poster.
Britt Reid listens to Santana?
Britt Reid listens to a lot of bands
where the guitar player...
...is featured heavily
as the lead of the band.
-Oh, that's--
-This is the face-replacement shot.
-l think they added--
-Don't--
Here's a mistake. The sword's there,
and now the sword is gone.
Oh, that's a slight....
That's a good job with the microphone,
Jeff Imada idea.
That was a great idea. They added
the sound of the microphone.
-That helped sell it a lot.
-Yeah, yeah.
I like this part, where he could do
anything he wants with you on this.
Then l remember the TV landed
on the ground in a cool pattern...
...you had the idea to do this.
This we added at last second.
You thought it was stupid.
We thought it was completely dumb,
and it's one of the funniest parts.
-This moment is great when you fall--
-This was wonderful.
And it's just super violent-seeming.
And this looked like Citizen Kane
for a minute.
You should've dug a hole,
shot from under.
Exactly, yeah.
Just stop! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
The fight just keeps going on
and on.
Me and Evan actually originally had it
that, like, it goes on even longer.
Like, l live on like the second storey
of the guesthouse...
...that we crash out the window,
fall down, land on the ground...
...and roll into the pool.
That would have been funny too.
Would've been good.
Totally think you'll land in the pool.
We're gonna land in the pool,
and we don't.
It happened in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.
Two guys fall, one landed on the side.
-And I think--
-l don't remember.
Here--
I mean, l'm always showing off...
...because you guys bring me down
constantly, so....
The idea that Kato can't swim on this
sort of reveal...
-...his poor upbringing.
-His weakness.
-And--
-Just you ripping off Unbreakable.
-Exactly.
-l didn't watch this film. Sorry.
-Never saw Unbreakable?
-lt's good.
Oh, you gotta see it, it's good.
-Kato could stand up there, but that's--
-l know. We are in 2 feet of water.
-His other weakness, standing.
-Not even Kato in the water.
But we can't say why.
-This is-- This part is.
-That's Jay.
That's Kato holding that lobster
for dear life.
You've recently developed an issue
with the lobster.
Because he got some laugh
off the lobster.
I'm starting to think we just--
We-- l just wish we went with
a less funny pool toy, to be honest.
-Well, it contributed to the humiliation.
-l guess so.
-You should direct her--
-This has been drastically trimmed.
-You don't like it, but l think it's fine.
-l think this scene is great.
I wanted Kato to go back
to his home here.
He has an awesome house.
This was one of your early ideas,
this whole split-screen sequence.
I remember when you came into
our office and pitched us this idea.
Yeah. l remember one thing
is at some point...
...l felt nobody was listening to me.
And l want--
I pay you a drink, and I say, "Okay,"
and l wanted to tell you:
"Okay, now l'm the director on set,
you have to listen to me."
Before I could say that...
...you said Neal wanted to get rid
of this montage...
...and you were the only one
to fight for it, so you cut me off--
I remember that, actually.
You were like:
"You ruined my whole plan."
But come on, guys.
-This is awesome, look.
-No, this is great.
Two cameras from one camera.
How did the hell this happen?
How did this happen?
And in 3D, this is really amazing.
It was a night of shooting
with the second unit.
We had to get people to stand in--
Still in their position...
...and rewind every time,
like, when you draw a tree.
Steve Love smoked more cigarettes
this night than l saw...
-...for the entire shoot.
-First AD.
That was a complicated night.
I wasn't there.
I have to point out that all the voices
you're hearing in this...
...were produced backwards
and added in ADR.
Gondry realised--
Or was it Evan that realised it?
Some realised that we could put words
into their mouths.
This was filmed without sound.
Confusing. You didn't quite get
what was happening.
Helps it
when you hear everyone talking.
We got a lip-reader to come in
who really didn't come through for us.
Failed miserably.
But the people who actually
recorded this were amazing.
One of the funner things
I've done in the movie.
It's pretty violent, though.
Well, yes, as we added sound,
it becomes a lot more violent.
You hear, like, people's brains
getting bashed in.
Here's a weird thing.
-The big laugh happens.
-That shot is great.
-The laugh is due to Popeye.
-No, the laugh--
Exactly. The laugh changed
in our second screening.
-lt's not because of the sweaters?
-No.
-When he says "Popeye."
-"Popeye."
It's the first time you hear Popeye
mentioned.
-Really?
-And happens to be missing an eye.
-Popeye.
-That is so unintentional.
-Yeah--
-No, but, no-- But the last time--
They laughed at the first time
and laughed at that shot.
-Yeah--
-Because he said Popeye again.
Every time he says--? Should've
had him say Popeye 1 5 more times.
-l know.
-We should add...
...they're called Popeye and Chili,
Gondry told me their names...
-...I didn't understand.
-Something bugs me.
Why is Jill--?
She is crying in the background.
I mean, she was the one
who wrote the article, no?
-Maybe.
-Because it's a tragic series of events.
-Yeah, but it's so dumb.
-She's emotional.
Why didn't you direct her better,
man?
I know. I'm-- lt's also a critique.
I never even noticed that
until right this second.
One of the funny--
That's-- The funniest thing
is on that trophy, it just says Kato.
Kato has no last name.
It's something
we always had a problem with.
We didn't know what to give him.
No last name for Kato.
Well, Kato was initially Japanese,
and then during the war...
...it was-- He became Filipino.
And then, he became Chinese
from Hong Kong.
-And now he's from Taiwan.
-Brief stint as a British Kato.
Yeah, l have to say, in writing it,
we were just faced with the notion...
...of explaining the weird stuff
that happened on the show like....
-Oh, man.
-Like, we'd been working on it...
...for a few months before we realised
that Kato only had one name.
And there was no alter ego for Kato.
And so we ultimately had to make that
a big part of the movie.
It was weird when we realised like,
"Wait."
Like, "Britt Reid has two names,
and Kato is just Kato." That's so weird.
They never explained that.
I think in the sequel, we should reveal
that his last name is Kaelin.
-Kato Kaelin.
-That's funny.
-Or just Kato. Kato Kato.
-See...
...here, great performance
of both of you guys. A good scene.
-And--
-This, one of the biggest ADR laughs.
-That's another one.
-Let's do it altogether when he does it.
Frank, are you--?
Yeah, David Harbour is awesome.
I'll never forget,
we were in the printing press...
...and l was in the middle
of loving Lost and watching Lost...
...which ended terribly. Whoever made it
should be ashamed of themselves.
And he was like,
"You know, I like adventures...
...and like--
Kind of like rustic things.
I love time travel
and kind of like sci-fi and--"
-Tell him watch to Lost?
-"Watch Lost?"
He was,
"I don't even know what it's about."
-Me neither.
-And now I--
I apologise if you're listening,
David...
...for putting you on a path to a show
that ended terribly.
"You get out of my office
right this second."
I'm so serious there.
Honestly,
the first time we screened this movie...
...that scene, l was like, "lf people
don't like this, I look stupid in that."
Every time l watch this scene,
all I can think is:
It's time for a montage
It's a research montage
I'm looking through research
To find some information and l found it
It's a montage
"Dad, how does it feel to be praised
as a hero and be a dirty creep and--"
That was a weird ADR that Gondry--
How--? Gondry used to have--
Pulls out a picture of his dad's face...
-...as an elephant's face, says "liar."
-Yes, he was a liar.
It was an awesome idea, guys.
-l didn't even under--
-What?
-l never understood it.
-l never understood either.
Because he's sort of a dinosaur.
He's old-fashioned. People mock him,
so they made a caricature of--
-So that's the elephant in this?
-Yes.
So it would be
like someone made it?
Yeah, that's the idea.
Like you do a caricature of your boss.
-l thought it was like a--
-Guys, now you understood.
I thought it was in Britt Reid's head.
But elephants
are very noble creatures.
Not if it's suppose to be a man.
I don't know, l mean, it's--
"But elephants are noble creatures."
They are. Horton Hears a Who!...
...is the greatest personification
of an elephant.
-Yeah--
-"He meant what he said...
...and said what he meant.
An elephant's faithful, 1 00 percent."
I don't think you can attribute
human quality to animals.
That's very-- That's Walt Disney--
This scene we're watching right now
is a reshoot.
-Shot on top of the Sony parking lot.
-Yeah, exactly.
So it was sand a little bit
coming from the wind, and I ask...
...if we could add some sand
to make it more unreal.
And they said no. They didn't want
to add for safety reason.
They literally said no?
He said, "lf there is sand here,
we can collect more from the roof...
...and pile it on the side, but you can't
bring any additional sand."
Wait. Why?
-That is very weird.
-For safety reasons.
-Who told you that?
-Yeah.
-What's his name?
-l think we can still change that.
-We can add more sand.
-No, who cares.
We should add big sand dunes.
Look on the floor,
you're gonna see sandbag...
-...dolly tracks and apple box and--
-Yeah, you're right.
I don't know what's behind,
I bet it's movie stuff.
It is. lt is.
This scene was shot on the cheap.
It's good performance.
-lt is a good scene.
-lt was funny because--
We-- You asked Christoph to ask--
To act over-the-top
and a little comical...
...and l was kind of upset
because at this is one...
...Christoph didn't want to listen to me
anymore, was upset at me.
And l thought
we needed to make him serious.
And eventually, l convinced him to do
one take, but we used your version.
Yeah, but he wasn't too happy
with me either.
-He was pissed off at us.
-Just pissed off at all of us.
-Nothing happened?
-No.
It's okay, though.
I mean, l guess that's what you get
when you get to know--
We're not all for everybody.
Not for everybody.
I can accept that.
Some people like me, some don't.
I don't need to be liked by everyone.
Things at The Sentinel?
Just America.
Just America and the world.
I only need billions of people
in the world.
You're from Canada,
you want to be loved by American.
-Canadians just wanna love.
-Canada is American's tofu.
-Just wanna be loved.
-Not American tofu.
-You're the tofu of America.
-We are our own tofu.
-You have some of the French tofu.
-We're the queen's tofu.
I don't know...
...anything...
...about journalism.
It makes no sense
Kato pulls up right there.
No. You don't get it?
Kato is a stalker.
Yeah-- Oh, Kato is an insane stalker,
I see.
He spent the last week
driving around Cameron Diaz's home.
No, he wanted to have an explanation
with Cameron and the--
-And he's like, "Oh, shit, Britt is there."
-Yeah.
My lips almost touched
Cameron Diaz's in this part right here.
Can almost see it happen.
In all the auditions...
...for Lenore, l got to play Kato...
...l got many little kisses
from many beautiful actresses.
Yeah. That's before Cameron
refused to kiss you.
Oh, it's true.
We read so many awesome girls.
Christina Hendricks.
So good-looking.
-Yeah, you liked her.
-My girl, Carolina....
I insulted horribly
your friend who came in.
Oh, that was bad.
You mocked her country.
She's from Poland.
Seth was like, "Oh, Poland.
I hear that's a bad place to live."
I didn't say that's a bad place to live.
You said,
"Oh, l hear it's terrible there."
-l did not say it's terrible.
-Well, she was nervous.
She took it the wrong way.
-Yeah, and she like--
-l expected her to be, "No, it's nice."
She was like,
"Are you being serious?"
I said-- What did l say?
It's, like, bleak or depressing.
-People act weird...
-You said it's depressing.
...because they're nervous.
-Can't judge them.
-lt's true.
-Well--
-Like when January Jones came in.
-We found out Michael Jackson died.
-She almost couldn't audition.
She said, "I don't know
if l can do this audition. l feel weird."
-Yeah.
-"A childhood icon is gone."
Well, it's true.
It was devastating news.
Gondry couldn't hold auditions.
Where does your fond love
for Michael Jackson come from?
From '82 when l saw him on TV,
first time.
He was one of the first video
you could see on TV.
"Billie Jean." And we always liked....
Didn't Scorsese direct that video?
No. He did "Bad" a few years later.
Oh, who directed "Billie Jean"?
Steve Barron, l think.
Some of those guys.
-l think--
-But anyway, l mean, to me...
...when Prince came along,
and all my cool friends say:
"Much better than Michael Jackson,"
I always got defensive.
-But you like Prince. Prince is rad.
-Yeah, I think he's awesome...
...but it's like-- I don't know, it's like--
Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.
Prince was considering trying
to get involved in The Green Hornet.
He said he likes Britt Reid
because he's a party guy.
-Just like Prince.
-That's the mayor's office.
Villaraigosa's office.
-l got three words for you:
-No.
"Suck my--"
-What's the line--?
-What is the line now?
-"Eat it, dick face?"
-The line, "Eat it, you dick face."
-l hope it worked.
-The best one...
...was when you were saying,
"Suck my ba--" "Suck an egg."
-Me too.
-Then Cameron would say:
"No, don't say that.
No, don't suck an egg."
That was great.
It was just an old-timey expression
that we all knew that--
Thought it was funny.
And you had a great joke about having
a password, literally dot, dot, dot.
Yeah, that was a funny joke.
I-- Well, l was gonna say,
like, when l was in editing room--
Went to Editing to look for options
to "suck an egg"...
...what l originally said after, "I got
three words for you. Suck an egg."
I've never been more mad at myself.
It was like 400 takes of me...
...just saying "suck an egg."
Like l didn't say antyhing else.
Like, "l must have said
one other funny thing."
No. Just "suck an egg"
from 300 different angles.
So here is a big part of the movie.
So Kato is being hired as a guerrilla
to kill Britt Reid.
He's lost his keys,
so he has to punch out--
I remember my idea that you guys
didn't want to do.
I wanted Kato to come
in the outfit of the Green Hornet.
Oh, yeah, I remember that.
That made no sense.
Well, it totally makes sense.
I agree your idea's probably better.
You want to see the team as they are.
But it totally made sense.
You know what would really--?
Just showed up dressed as Batman.
Would have really been good.
That's Bloodnofsky now
with the big red--
I love that little ****.
-l mean that bloody red flag.
-We should say "beep."
-But....
-Oh, here comes this flashback--
This was scary, Evan. Me and you
have never written a movie...
-...with a plot before. l remember--
-Don't say that.
It was really hard to, like, write,
like, an actual plot...
...like, something with, like,
"This guy...
...is blackmailing this guy,
trying to get this guy to do something."
That's the stunt guy that was
supposed to be the taxi driver on that--
The big blond dude
holding the hanger, yeah.
-Sorry, l think I cut you off.
-lt's okay. No, I'm fine.
So here comes the big
flashback sequence that would--
The twirly lights.
That was one of your ideas.
-lt was suppose to hypnotise people--
-You had an idea...
-...that it made them throw up.
-One shot when the guy threw up.
We filmed that,
the version of those lights.
There is two video projector in front
of the car to project those lights.
Did they add that,
like, pulsating of the lights?
The video projector
was projecting the material.
Oh, that's real.
Oh, that's pretty cool.
So these flashbacks...
...we're gonna see
were a little complicated, visually.
I was trying to--
Because, basically, you said your
character is trying to solve a problem.
-Yeah.
-l wanted to create a visual puzzle.
I thought--
First half of the shooting, I....
Told my brain to find a way.
-Yeah.
-Eventually, I find a way, did a sketch.
I remember saying to my girlfriend,
"They will never go for it."
And l showed the drawing to Neal.
He say, "l don't get it. Just shoot it."
-Yeah.
-l have to say, that was his genius.
-lt was.
-Didn't understand it, but just shoot it.
The only reason
we get away with this...
...is because of the joke
at the end of it.
-l agree.
-lt's because we, like...
...pulled the rug out
from under ourselves.
Yeah, but--
Wait until you see it in 3D.
-lt's so awesome.
-l'm excited to see it in 3D.
I have not yet seen at this moment,
November 22nd, 201 0.
Yeah, we're talking from the past.
If we are listening to ourselves...
...it's ourselves in the past
talking to ourselves in the future.
Only now, it's the present.
I understand, all right.
-When will then will be now?
-Soon.
-Soon.
-Now is constantly moving.
Now this sushi USB drive
was your idea, Gondry.
You know what?
It was my sushi, I got in Japan.
And....
I'll be honest,
I was very sceptical about it.
And then our previs guys
were previs-ing the action sequence...
...our friend Nick Stoller came by...
...directed Get Him to the Greek
and Forgetting Sarah Marshall.
I was showing him the previs,
the first thing he said was:
"My God, is that a sushi USB drive
you're chasing?
That's hilarious." Then it's like,
"Fine. It's a stupid sushi."
-Yeah, people like it.
-Yeah, now people like it.
A great performance here
from David Harbour.
Yeah, this is such, like, an arch
moment, and he totally does it.
-The lean forward.
-This guy can do anything.
"Was administered by me."
Shit!
-Makes me laugh that l just go, "Shit."
-So now we go into the mental puzzle.
Which includes a bit of Kato-Vision.
So basically, you're collecting
all the element from your memories...
...to build up the reality...
...that he just told you,
that your father was murdered.
-Yeah.
-So he had all these dollar notes.
And this is all, like, built
based on a practical set that we built.
-Yeah.
-Which was the weirdest thing...
...you've ever seen in your life.
And if you look, that's a shot
I saw in 3D, and it looks awesome.
-Oh, awesome.
-Theodore Bressman, 3D.
And we--
You can see the bicycle glasses
on the--
-That's right, in one shot.
-Your dad's nose.
The bicycle glasses are from
some bits we lost where he goes:
"Maybe they're father and son."
Christoph Waltz pushing
David Harbour on a bicycle.
Which we filmed.
He says, "Or lovers."
They're in bed cuddling.
That was a funny joke,
but we couldn't--
Oh, there's my cameo.
Raffi, that shadow. There you go.
As we shot the movie,
we would reshoot every scene almost.
With a big spotlight on one of us...
...knowing we would use it
in this sequence.
That's a practical set
they're standing on right there.
The weirdest set of all time.
It had, like, a railing.
The cowboy-hat railing is still there.
-Yeah. No--
-The cowboy hat-- For no reason, the--
-Reference to Brokeback Mountain.
-Reference...
...when they're in bed together.
-But--
-Oh, here's the line.
--expression you've
had on your face for five minutes....
-That's a line that saves the montage.
-lt does.
We know it's stupid
and that it lasts a long time.
When we were writing it, we're like:
"Can we do this? Can we put
the entire explanation for everything...
...in one giant paragraph, but--
I remember Ange...
...one of the executives, saying
that was hilarious.
I couldn't believe the studio
went for that, to be totally honest.
They're like-- l have to say making this
was a giant pain in the ass...
...from the studio's standpoint.
When you make a cheap movie...
...they let you do whatever you want.
They were up our ass about stuff.
At the end,
we got away with a lot of shit...
...that l'm shocked
they let us put in this.
Like, it's pretty unbelievable
that we got to do a lot of this stuff.
Yeah, well, l think, sometimes,
they just think...
...some stuff they don't know must
be cool. lt's how it works in science.
The desire, 40 years ago, that biology
would be the next big thing...
...and it was before
the guinea pig stuff.
I don't buy biology.
-Evan's not a believer.
-l'm not into it.
You don't believe in biology, yes?
Jewish science is
what I used to follow.
Man, that was scary.
Okay, that's the beginning of the--
All big ride of the end.
Now, me and Evan
were very firmly res--
The whole end just had to be
wall-to-wall action.
I mean, when we write,
we talk about having it be a build.
And we just know that even if the
beginning of the movie isn't good...
...if the end's really exciting...
...then you'll leave the theatre
feeling satisfied.
So l'd say, like, this movie
had a very large budget.
A lot of it went into the last 20 minutes
of the movie.
I feel, literally, a third of the budget.
Yeah, l think, like, if not more.
I would not--
Half of the budget went
into the last 20 minutes of the movie.
And, like, if you're on the DVD, and
you go look at the deleted scenes...
...there are stunts we didn't use
that were huge.
But most of them wound up
in that Van Halen montage.
-Almost no stunts we didn't use.
-Yeah, it's true.
Like the trunk popping up.
I love that stunt.
Oh, yeah. But it's--
It plays later in the print-press room.
Well, l think the craziest thing to me
is how everyone thinks that when--
The one frame of that trunk flying off
is being registered by the audience.
It doesn't matter.
The car gets the shit beat out of it...
...that you're not really
tracking the damage.
What's amazing is that someone
went to the effort to add that thing.
We asked for that.
And the sound as well. We asked to
add the sound to make it more clear.
It's a lot of conflicting emotions.
Very funny idea line.
Yeah, again, this sequence is--
You can see there's a camera crew
right here, you're gonna see in a sec.
Right there.
-Yeah, behind that truck, yeah.
-By that pole.
Yeah, you know, so much
of the car chase is done...
...from shots of outside of the car
that we add a lot of dialogue.
And just-- Me and Jay were never
actually sitting in a moving vehicle...
...for any shot
of this entire car chase.
-Don't say.
-l'm just saying it.
I think people should know.
This is all blue screen.
No, it's not all blue screen.
When you see--
Everything with me and Jay,
anytime you see me and Jay...
...we're in a stationary vehicle.
This is real. The stunts are real.
That's why I was a little bit
against the previs...
...because we had an amazing stunt
crew, and they were demotivated.
-Yeah.
-Door gun. My idea.
But the bullets coming out was ours.
But l remember when l got this idea,
the guy who was making the car...
...was trying to trick me and say, "Oh,
if you open the car door this way...
...it's gonna be too heavy."
And l say to him, "It's gonna be easier
to close them back then."
And then I shut him up.
This was a good idea.
That was Vic Armstrong's son
driving into the bus, right?
That-- Yeah, our stunt choreographer
was Vic Armstrong...
...who was Indiana Jones
and Superman.
And he's choreographed a lot
of action movies.
-And he rolls with the whole family.
-Yeah, his son and his brother.
And his son drove that car through
the bus, which is unbelievable.
And here's Dave,
our favourite stunt guy.
Dave was in the car chase.
-Wait.
-There goes the truck.
There goes the truck.
This was something me and Evan
were obsessed with.
In that old draft of The Green Hornet
I was reading...
...there were seven of these things
chasing us.
We used to have this great stunt...
...where they drove
through the Hollywood Hills...
...and ended up going off a cliff...
-...and through a house.
-Crashing into my house.
Or a house.
But this, they did a pretty good job
with in the end.
They got good details,
like cars behind the Black Beauty.
Yeah, me and Evan always
were really into the idea...
...of these giant mini-gun SUV things.
On YouTube, there's a lot of--
Primarily because of the lighting. How
it lights up the trace-around element.
So that was an idea
that you had early on...
...that Kato would jump from car to car.
I thought it'd be ridiculous.
Yeah, this was something we had
very early on.
-Kato jumping.
-l will say...
...if it ran rampant,
it would have been ridiculous.
-A toned-down version.
-lt had to be done well.
Like, we had him hopping
from car to car to car.
And then Snake Eyes did that
in G.I. Joe...
...and for some reason,
we felt like we had to change it then.
Well, honestly,
the movie has so little CG...
...full, like, CG sequences in it.
The only way to do Kato
hopping from car to car...
...would have been really
to CG it up.
And it just wouldn't look
like the rest of the movie, you know?
Just jump in!
And here they were really there.
I mean, it was not a driver.
Yeah, there actually was a dude doing
that, which was pretty insane. Yeah.
But it's a long car chase. lt was even
longer before, if you can believe it.
Well, the first, l remember,
we showed the car chase--
It was 1 5 minutes long.
He was like, "Are you guys insane?"
We were like, "We like action."
I know, it's like the length
of, like, a Simpsons episode.
Just the car chase.
All those Daily Sentinel signs
are CG.
I would say, writing the film,
the greatest challenge...
...was how to get them
to The Daily Sentinel?
How can we justify
going to The Daily Sentinel?
In the end. We knew we wanted
the big end sequence to take place...
...in The Daily Sentinel,
and it was really hard...
...to find a way to do it.
We didn't quite do it,
it doesn't make sense.
Yeah, they could have gone anywhere
to do this.
Yeah, but--
Well, l guess our big rationale...
...is that you see
that Britt has an online server.
-But l don't-- l think we over-thought it.
-lt just works well enough.
It started to work when the editing
was tightened up.
Then you don't question,
you just know you want to go there.
Yeah. Every blue moon,
one of my friends will question it.
-l'll be like, "It's a movie."
-That's why.
"That's why."
Oh, Evan, are you gonna do
your favourite line?
-His favourite line?
-Paper's coming up.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
These robots were actually
in the printing press.
-They're real.
-They replaced a fun job by a robot.
So now, it's all gonna go bankrupt
because nobody buys paper anymore.
We showed up there to do our scout.
There's these robots carrying paper.
And we thought
it'd be neat to integrate them.
Except the paper was not rolling--
-Yeah, the paper's CG.
-Yeah, we did that in post.
There was chances
of life-threatening paper cuts.
-Yeah, exactly.
-Decapitated by paper cuts.
"Or your blood."
It was weird. While we were filming
there, we got tomorrow's paper...
-...that day.
-Oh, yeah.
That was Armstrong who fell, no?
No, that was just some big dude.
I gotta say, as your partner
in business, Seth...
...this is the most impressive thing.
-Yeah, I actually did that.
-Look.
Not until after I watched it
on the DVD stuff...
...did l realise you bungee-jumped.
-lt was pretty crazy. l jumped off.
-lt must have been, like--
You must have gathered
your courage and jumped.
All right, here we go.
-"Paper, paper. Transporting paper."
-"Transporting paper. Transporting--"
We were gonna add
that all those robots talk and say:
"Paper, transporting paper."
-"Paper roll 47 from Row 9."
-"Paper, transporting paper."
Look, that's your favourite moment,
Evan, when he falls.
-This part.
-Yeah, that one.
All of us say...at this moment.
I mean, l have to say, like--
I wish we can take credit
for the idea...
...of this paper room and this thing.
We literally walked into this room.
It was there.
-The credit we take is we used it.
-Yeah, we used it.
Thought it would be amazing
to do an action sequence.
And then while we're there,
we came up with the idea...
...of hiding behind one of the rolls,
and it kind of shrinks his--
The big Charlie Chaplin,
Buster Keaton joke coming up.
Yeah, exactly.
-This thing here would be funny.
-lt looks like the giant paper--
When Mythbusters came
to see the movie, l asked them:
"Would you get shot
through this paper?"
They said that a bullet would go
no more than an inch.
-Yeah. No, this one actually works.
-Very dense, the paper.
Yeah, that would actually work.
Kato!
They're building the next space shuttle
out of paper.
Out of paper. They're not building
any more space shuttles.
Space turned out no good.
-People don't care for space.
-They're not going to Mars?
They're not going anywhere.
-The space programme's over.
-Now, this shot works.
-A long time coming, though.
-Yeah.
That was the hardest
visual-effects moment.
That I did too. l actually did that.
-This shot, Michel got for free.
-For free.
-Oh, yeah.
-By endearing others.
Endearing a visual-effects company.
-Special thanks to ClS.
-ClS Vancouver.
-l think it was that one.
-No, ClS Hollywood.
Everyone always has to know
that this entire sequence...
-ls completely real. No visual effects.
-...is practical. They're not miniatures.
-We--
-All set at Culver Studios.
-Yeah.
-And actually, l go there--
I wanted the car to go
through the elevator 30 years ago.
And here's the death of Dave.
You know the only sad part
in this is?
I was doing some call
for our untitled cancer comedy.
Oh, you didn't see this.
-And I missed this.
-Yeah, actually.
What's funny is you wanted the car
to lift the elevator.
Me and Evan had the idea
that the front half keeps driving.
You're like, "That's insane.
We can't do that."
That's not true. This was my idea
of the front car keep driving.
-No, because--
-l'll show you a clip on YouTube.
-No, it was the exact opposite.
-No, that is me.
You don't believe it would work.
That was my idea,
the half-car driving, all right?
I don't know which one of you is right,
but I remember looking at videos...
-...on YouTube of half-cars.
-But one of us is right.
-Someone's right.
-Me.
But that half-car actually drove.
It's so crazy
that this movie took so long...
...that we can't remember
who actually was arguing which side...
-...of which argument.
-Don't remember.
But this was the only time
someone almost got hurt.
-Those two guys, they got smoked.
-They got ploughed through that wall.
The fact that they built that half-car
that actually moved was amazing.
So, yeah, just for you to remember,
that's the place...
...where you saw Cameron sitting
and having the first meeting.
Yeah. And that's actually the place
where we drove--
We literally drove that car through
those offices, which was amazing.
Yeah, l wanted to have the dad
telling you you always fail...
...as a flashback here because it's the
same location when you were a kid.
We used to have a great
upcoming moment...
...where Axford,
Edward James Olmos...
...came out of the secret bar
and attacked the Green Hornet.
-Gas him.
-l shoot him in the face.
-"Get out of Britt's office."
-And then at the end...
...he was supposed
to cough green gas.
So you hear--
You see the next floor here.
When we were writing the movie...
...we kept talking
about how Iron Man is great.
But it comes down to, "Press that
button so the bomb doesn't blow up."
Yeah, and in the end, our movie's:
"Press the button."
I know, essentially, it comes down
to button pressing.
-We made it a joke.
-And here, we have many Kato to--
Yeah, we had five dudes
dressed in Kato outfits...
-...hidden all around the office.
-lt's the same shot.
The upcoming one when he kicks him
is actually me.
-No visual effects.
-That's me.
Getting kicked.
And here is--
Okay, we had long conversation
of the failure of--
We totally changed this.
I think we made it better.
We made it clear that
just no data was recorded at all...
...which, I think, was
ultimately more satisfying.
And look, the gun splitting.
So possibly,
the gun splitting was possibly...
...the most debated part
of the whole film.
I waged war on Gondry
to not have it in the movie.
And it was cool in the end.
It was only cool in the end
because eventually...
...it became a plot point
that he has made--
He's evolved. He's evolved.
I love that the missile blows a hole
through the ceiling into the office.
I think that was a cool idea.
On the set, it looked awesome.
Now, originally,
when he took off Kato's mask--
You'll see something amazing.
The sushi's gonna make a big rock
of concrete bounce. Here.
That's pretty funny.
Because that is not foam.
It's concrete.
This stereo gun goes into both eyes.
That was one of your first ideas,
Gondry, is that he--
Double-barrelled gun pressed
into a dude's eyes.
Look how he's gonna die at the end.
It's about stereo.
This is why this movie
was planned to be in 3D.
-l know. Even the gun is stereo.
-Yeah.
Kato is great here. Jay is great.
I think my favourite shot
of the movie...
...is the one of Seth approaching the
door that comes up. Just aesthetically.
-Yeah, it does look good.
-Oh, yeah.
It's so mystical.
-Heroic moment of Seth Rogen...
-Where is it?
-...of Britt Reid.
-This is it. This moment.
-lt's mystical.
-lt's a good-looking shot.
I actually did this. This is actually me.
I did this shit. We chose the--
-Man in action.
-We show the one---
We show the one take
where l actually did it...
...because the stuntmen just
don't move as goofy as I do in real life.
Which is the problem.
We had the helicopter sound here,
I think.
James Newton Howard did
a good job.
-Oh, yeah, he's so awesome.
-lt's so cool.
When we were watching it, like,
"This part doesn't work."
-He's like, "Yeah, I'll fix that."
-"l can do that, yeah."
-l--
-Now this is unbelievably violent...
...but we got away with it,
which is so awesome.
And there is no effect-- He--
This day, he was so pissed off,
Christoph, he has to wear the mask.
-Well, that looked uncomfortable.
-Yeah.
But he did a great performance
because of that.
Yeah, he was great there.
I like this moment.
Every time, l think the Green Hornet
should have that double gun...
...in the sequel
because it's cooler than the gas gun.
I should have a double-barrelled
gas gun.
-Oh, yeah. That's cool.
-Hey, that's not bad.
We're not gonna do a sequel.
We're not gonna do a sequel?
How pessimistic is that? That's crazy.
There's no way
we're not gonna do a sequel.
It's not gonna do well enough
to make that, but we'll do a prequel.
-Yeah.
-A whole--
A whole other group of people
will get to do a prequel.
The craziest thing that we got away
with in the whole movie.
Essentially, what happens is...
...is l explain to Kato how
I did not get the information there.
And he says to me, "Don't worry,
because l'm just gonna kill Scanlon."
And we got away with that.
-Don't worry. I'll murder his ass.
-Don't worry. I'll just murder him.
And he does, right there.
Now he's dead.
And the sushi's back, yeah?
It's a Hanukkah manoeuvre?
How do you--? Heimlich manoeuvre.
Heimlich. That was the big
Heimlich manoeuvre.
-And the--
-The ejector seat.
This was one of the earlier jokes
we wrote in the movie.
I cannot believe
how well the seat's played out.
We wrote this-- This was in one
of the first drafts, the ejector seats.
Record player,
that was a good idea from you.
-That was a really good one.
-l'm glad you like it.
This whole shot is CG. l went
to the visual-effects house today.
That's a complicated shot.
Now I-- l'm sure people
will believe you were hanging.
We did one shot
when you were hanging high.
-lt was horrifying.
-We didn't even use it.
No, we didn't use it at all.
It was really scary, though.
That's why I said that.
--leaving a trail of demolished cars
and trucks....
It was cool how they filmed almost the
whole chase in B-roll like that.
Okay?
Now, l'll say, this ending
is from a Green Hornet episode...
-...from, like, 1 966.
-We wrote it.
We wrote--
We wrote that episode in 1 966...
...but we have to disclaim that it's
from that episode.
-And in that episode--
-But who--?
That's your job,
to take some moments--
-And we do have to admit it.
-We updated it.
-People, sometimes, they're like--
-The best part of the whole movie.
So in the episode--
And we changed it a bit.
In the episode, the Green Hornet
gets shot in the shoulder.
By a cop who clearly sees him
and gets shot.
And they don't know what to do.
And the end of the episode
is Britt Reid walking into his office...
...and Kato comes in
through the elevator or something...
...dressed like Kato
and runs into Britt's office.
You hear him yell,
"Green Hornet sends his regards."
You just hear a gunshot off camera,
and Kato runs out of the office...
...and Britt Reid emerges
with a gunshot wound...
...to the shoulder, essentially.
In reality, it wouldn't make sense
because they'd see...
...that it was, like, a four-hour
gunshot wound. Four-hour-old.
I wonder if people think,
"Is it a blank...
...or did he just shoot me again
in the exact same spot?"
-lt's a blank.
-Okay, good.
-l think so.
-Clearly.
I think it's a blank, yeah.
I always interpret it as a blank.
Oh, l remember how l wanted to--
I made this joke.
I wanted Kato to tell the old story
of the old movie...
...and l had this friend
speak perfect English.
-Oh, yeah.
-Speaking instead of him...
-...only it was his mouth.
-So weird.
-That was a pretty funny joke.
-And then--
-And then--
-Yeah.
You've gotta dig this bullet
out of my meat.
-That's a good line.
-But this, we wanted to--
There was a version, l think...
...where she actually dug it out of you,
wasn't there? No, she tried.
This was so gross, but we wanted
to drag it on a little longer.
Sterilize it.
I can't believe we got away with this,
also. This ending. It's just so long.
-No, it's funny.
-l don't feel the same.
Cameron is always--
Makes this thing funny.
She's really great in this scene.
And it also, like, this establishes
the dynamic for the future...
-Yeah.
-...of the Green Hornet.
--mastermind of this, just let me....
My favourite joke in the movie
is coming up...
-...about Scanlon dying.
-Oh, yeah, l have to say.
Mere hours ago....
-Little piece of paper falling.
-Little piece of paper.
Lot of negotiations.
Yeah, that was hard to get, huh?
We're running out of steam.
It's unfortunate, but...
...you know, that's what happens.
-There it was. That was the joke.
-You're gonna see Scanlon coughing.
It's because he was supposed
to cough green gas.
-Right there.
-Axford.
-We didn't use it.
-Yeah, Axford.
-Axford.
-We didn't use it.
What's funny is they tried to use parts
of this scene in the commercials.
But l'm all pale and sweaty because
I've been shot in the shoulder.
I just look horrible. l don't think
they ever knew that that was a joke.
-Remember what happened this day.
-Yeah, we drove a Black Beauty.
This was one of the first days
of filming.
And we've smashed into a wall.
-Drove this Black Beauty--
-Marble from ltaly.
Yeah, yeah,
the gas pedal just stuck.
-Yeah.
-But did you guys know this?
-lf he hadn't hit that wall--
-Died.
He could have died,
he'd have hit the next wall...
...30 yards ahead.
-He strategically turned into that wall.
-Oh, he did?
Yeah. Sammy turned it into that wall
intentionally to stop it...
...because it was out of control,
and he didn't wanna hit anyone.
So he intentionally put it there
as a safest stopping point for the car.
Yeah. Bold.
Now, the car changing colour, Gondry,
where did you get that idea from?
I don't know. l wanted one thing
special about the car.
It was like Back to the Future.
That's what you would always say.
Yeah, when he comes back
at the end of the--
You'd always say how you liked that.
It's like he has the next car already.
The car for the next movie
at the end of the first.
I wanted to make a different shape...
...from the windshield. And you said,
"No, no." We argued about that.
Then l came up with changing colour.
That's right. You wanted
to kind of give it a weird cockpit.
This joke was one
me and Evan like.
All these movies have something
at the end...
...like, "Everything we've done up to
now sucks. Here's what's happening."
Well, that was Neal's idea, his ending
to put back the hype together.
-Was it? No.
-Yep.
I remember we find it cheesy,
but that was Neal's idea.
-Maybe it was.
-Yeah. It's Neal's idea.
I have to say it in his absence
because it hurt my feeling to....
-Should say something good.
-l'll give him that one.
That was Neal's whirly-dirly idea.
I'm upset that we don't have
their conversation...
...like, "Why an animal and a colour?
-Doesn't have to be animal and colour."
-You can hear it a bit.
On the credits--
I hope we're gonna see the credits.
He really hit me in the balls
pretty hard.
It seems like it.
That's a turkey tap.
-A turkey tap?
-That's a full-on turkey tap.
Is that even an ADR or l mean a...?
No, that's like--
That's the practical sound...
...of my testicles getting hit
by his glove.
And the guy who did the hornet
we just saw...
...we got the idea to hire them
to do the full credit.
It's awesome.
That's it. Does anyone have
anything else they'd like to say?
-l have a poem to read...
-Can we wrap this up?
...about my emotions
from The Green Hornet.
Anything you'd like to say?
We're good.
Thank you for watching and listening.
And l apologise to all the people
who we talked shit about...
...insulted, and you'll probably
never hear this, so it's okay.
-Thanks, guys.
-lf we offended you...
...wait until the end.
There's an address you can write.
-lt's Sony Pictures.
-lt's all the way at the bottom.
-E-mail them your complaints.
-They read every one of them.
-Thank you, guys. Peace.
-All right, goodbye.
