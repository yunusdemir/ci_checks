SONNY: Traveling...
Across oceans,
through endless days and weeks.
As a 10-year-old, it's an adventure.
But a child's eyes,
they haven't learned to
recognize fear, or sacrifice
or the pain that comes
from losing everything.
This is a story about coming to America.
Only, it's not that story, the one where
everyone lives happily ever after.
No, this isn't that story.
ANNOUNCER 1: ...on the air-bridged
harbor that twin cities frame.
Through this golden door,
under the gaze of that mother of exiles,
has come millions of men and women
who first set foot on American soil
right there on Ellis Island,
so close to the Statue of Liberty.
ANNOUNCER 2:
In 1980 President Carter signed into law
the Immigration Reform Act,
granting immigration status to any
individual able to show well-founded fear
of persecution in their homeland...
ANNOUNCER 3: Border Patrol
officials speculate the number
of illegal aliens entering this country
rose from 30,000 a year
to almost 190,000.
GEORGE H.W. BUSH:
I'd like to see something done about
the illegal alien problem
that would be so sensitive and so
understanding about labor needs
and human needs that that
problem wouldn't come up.
POLITICIAN 1:
This is an interesting day, August 19th,
because today we will have 500,000
or half a million applications
for legalization or amnesty.
RONALD REAGAN: It is true
our borders are out of control.
It is also true that this has
been a situation on our borders
back through a number
of administrations.
(SPEAKING CANTONESE)
(MOTHER SPEAKING MANDARIN)
(SHOUTING IN CANTONESE)
(IN ENGLISH) Hot dog.
POLITICIAN 2: The irony is,
this country was built by foreigners.
And yet, if you ask Americans today,
more than half of them
are anti-immigration.
(DISTANT SIREN WAILING)
POLITICIAN 3: These families came
here to work, they came to grow.
Others came to America in different
and often harrowing conditions.
(MAN SPEAKING CANTONESE)
POLITICIAN 3: But this place symbolizes
what they all managed to build,
no matter where they came from.
They didn't ask what this
country could do for them,
but what they could do to make this,
this refuge, the greatest
home of freedom in history.
(PANTING)
(MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
SONNY: When you come to a new
country, who you were before,
none of it mattered.
You had to play by new rules.
And in Flushing, it was the Green

They were always on
the hunt for new recruits.

SONNY: With Chinatown
bursting at the seams,
Flushing became a landfill
for the hundreds of Chinese
arriving every month.
Most of us lived near
the Orient Express,

To the Greeks and Jews who lived there,
it seemed like overnight their
quiet little neighborhood
became littered with
Chinese restaurants,
and of course, mahjong parlors.

For Paul it was a matter of saving face.

What do you want, Sonny?
You want to be my boyfriend?
Let me tell you something.
I don't date Green Dragons.

Hey.
You know, Big Nose
going to be all right.
How do you know that?
You probably don't know this,
but I can read someone's future
by looking at their face.
(SCOFFS)
Can I?
Our entire life is
mapped out in the eyes,
the nose, but most
importantly the mouth.
It tells how your life will end.
You have a beautiful mouth, Sonny.
Lies do not come easily for you.
If you live past this year,
you'll live a long life.
REPORTER:
Authorities say a Venezuelan trawler
ran aground tonight in
the Long Island Sound
in an apparent attempt to smuggle dozens
of Chinese men, women and
children into the country.
Once the ship was
marooned on the sandbar,
many were left to swim for their lives.
I think we tell the families
it was an act of God.
We could've made a fortune today.
SNAKE HEAD: Winning at mahjong
doesn't mean winning every hand.
How many Chinese are there, Paul,
waiting to get here? A billion?
Now this, Sam, this is different.
They ran the fucking boat
right up onto the beach.
Don't you get it? They're like rats.
You let one in, you get 10.
The next month, that 10 turns into 100!
Yeah, no, I will.
You all right?
I was nine when my mother died.
I can still remember her eyes.
She was so scared.
They fished me out,
gave me to another family.
It's a risk, bringing people to America.
It takes 20 men to get one of you here.
Still, only three in five make it alive.
So why do they do it?
Why do I do it?
'Cause they pay you, what...
Ten grand?
Thirty.
Look, a dishwasher
here works like a slave.
But he has hope.
He can dream of something better.
A fisherman in China,

They assign this to two detectives

- So, what about it?
- So...
I've seen missing dogs get

'Cause he's Asian.
What? Tang? Did I say something wrong?
TANG: I hear your boys have

I have no boys. I'm a businessman.
You look familiar.
Have we ever known each other?
Yeah. You and your boys used
to beat the life out of me.
Look at this.
Can't be good for business.
Do you know what

What goes around comes around.
Bringing me in,

How the hell you eat with those

You know, they're coming, Sam.
Whether you want to believe it or not.
In case you forgot, let me
remind you, we're the FBI.
We don't investigate tourists
who overstay their visas.
You assume whoever
comes here is a saint.
Remember the Irish?
They put every convicted criminal
they had on a boat to Ellis Island.
There's guys in Flushing right now,
illegal aliens,
and they're building empires.
And just like the Jews and the
Irish or the Italians before them,
you and everybody else doesn't think
that there's an immigration problem.
And there is, and it's about
to become a crime problem.
You listen to yourself?
If you wanna investigate a couple of
delivery boys, you go right ahead.
But don't do it on government time.
You are dead wrong about this.
Sure I am.
How was your trip, uncle?
PAUL: Exhilarating.
Listen, tomorrow I want
you to come with me.
We're gonna pay a visit to Ah Tai.

(SPEAKING CANTONESE)
(IN ENGLISH) You want in?
I have another batch coming next week.
You got connections. Why you need me?
I had a couple of deals turn bad,
which now limits my ability

- What are we talking about?
- Four kilos to start.
You get 10% after sale.
I need 50,000 up front.
In good faith.
Considering the risk,
15% seem more reasonable.

get a big dinner, stay at a nice hotel.

From what I understand,
you're the closest thing there is
to an Asian Gang Unit here in Queens.
There's a lot of shit
going down in Flushing,
some of it involving a person
of interest to the Bureau.
Paul Wong?
I've been tracking Paul's gang,
the Green Dragons, for a long time.
Okay, and?
It's the freaking Wild West out there.
And law enforcement,
when it comes to Asian folks,
white guys like you,
you don't give a shit.
It's a numbers game. You'll learn that.
You speak Chinese?
Cantonese.
Chinese isn't a language,
it's a family of languages.
Some speak Mandarin,
Shanghainese, Fookinese.
Then there's the non-Chinese languages.
Vietnamese, Korean...
You're not even listening.
I'm listening. Do you know who this is?

Would she have any

There's an easy way to find out.
SONNY: Come on, come on, come on.
That's for me?
Yeah.

POLICEMAN: This way, move, move!
Hands on the wall, now!
WHITE TIGER: Fuck! God damn it!
(SPEAKING CANTONESE)
(IN ENGLISH) We can't just
leave him in jail. I can fix this.
Is this about Teddy or the girl?
Paul, please!
Please, we have to...
Sonny, listen to me.
Look at me! Look at me!
The mooncakes?
This is just the beginning.
I want you to leave it alone.

Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
They found heroin in
the fucking mooncakes.
I get 15, maybe more for this.
The DA want me to talk.
(TEDDY SPEAKING CANTONESE)
(IN ENGLISH) So how is he?
He's in jail, Sonny! What do you think?
What did Paul say?
The Dragons have
nothing to do with this.
What?
It wasn't us.
The White Tigers, they ratted him out.
Paul said all of them,
they're going down.
But we can't be brought
into this. It's done.
Did you know he was
carrying heroin, Sonny?
Did you know that?
How could you? Fuck you, Sonny!
Names, addresses, anything you want
to know about the Green Dragons
and how they're smuggling illegal
aliens into this country.
Where'd you get all this stuff?
BLOOM: I've been working this
guy that I told you about.
Flushing police.
HIGGINS:
No disrespect to the boys in blue,
but if these people have a problem
with the people in Flushing,
that's their problem.
These guys are part of a crew that's
pulling in millions of dollars a year.
Only what they're smuggling are people!
Now, I don't understand why you
don't wanna do anything about this.
All right.
Suppose I wanna know more
about these Flying Dragons...
Green Dragons.
They're called the Green Dragons.
Whatever.
So what else do they do?
Word on the street is they
wanna start bringing in heroin.
(TRAIN THUNDERING)
SONNY: Georgie...
You owe me a lot of money, Georgie.
Today. I need it today.
Sorry, man. Business is bad.
Business is bad...
Then why the fuck are you gambling
in my joints and fucking my whores?
See, I'm willing to work something out,
but my brother here
is one angry motherfucker.
Hey, old man. I got trees for sale.
How many you want, huh?
Look at this motherfucker. Get those
marbles out of your mouth, bitch.
What the fuck is up your ass? Huh?
Get the fuck off me,
you fucking piece of shit!
Fuck you!
Put the fucking knife down!
Okay. Okay.
See, he's a fucking pussy.
That's it?
That's all he had, Dai Lo.
I know a place full of cash.
Yeah, a fucking ATM.
My Uncle Charlie runs a
mahjong place off Broadway.
My mother said he's
sitting on a gold mine.
That's why you're my favorite Dragon.
Wait, are you out of your fucking mind?
What difference does it make?
A few thousand to him,
that's like a tax or some shit.
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
PAUL: (IN ENGLISH)
I don't support what happened.
But out on the streets,
how can the Dragons, or anyone,
prevent this kind of destiny?
I just want the fucking
asshole who killed my son.
The Dragons will honor your boy's death.
But we do it our way.

Don't fucking move!

Don't you fucking look at him!
Look down! Look the fuck down!

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

If I find even one dollar,
you are going to pay, old man!
UNCLE CHARLIE: Leave them alone!
(GRUNTING)
(SCREAMING)
Leave her alone!
If you're hiding anything, I'm gonna hurt
you in ways you'll never forget!
This one looks tasty, Dai Lo.
(SCREAMING) No!
- Talk to me!
- I'm begging you!
- Dai Lo!
- UNCLE CHARLIE: No, leave her alone!
Dai Lo!
Dai Lo, look, I got the money. Let's go.
I told you not to lie to me.
Now I break your heart.
Boys!
It's mahjong time!
(SCREAMING)

This is your own fucking fault!
Hurry up, boys!
Rip her fucking clothes off!
Hurry up!
I CHUNG: She's a fucking tease!
Right, boys. Chicken Wing, I'm next!
UNCLE CHARLIE: No. No, not my baby!

You're fucking dead!

(YELLING IN CANTONESE)
(IN ENGLISH)
Okay, all right. Stop talking, bitch!
Sonny! Steven!
Yeah. I specifically asked
for no MSG. Okay?
Look at my mouth.
It's completely swollen. You see it?
- Oh, wow.
- It's all swollen.
Yes, yes.
Yeah, well, that's why I asked.
That's why said, no MSG.
MANAGER: I'll give you another one.
We can pack this.

Get the fuck out of my sight!
Get the fuck out!
(SPEAKING CANTONESE)
(IN ENGLISH) Get the fuck off me, man.
Fuck!
What are you doing?
I'm walking. What are you doing?
Your mom just saw you kill a man.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Fuck that dude. He deserved to get shot.
Hey! Hey!
Is that your answer now?
What, you're just gonna
go shoot everybody?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
You think I don't feel fucking pain?
Shoot me!
Oh, man. Look at your
fucking face right now.
Cops come looking for you, this will put
you away for the rest of your life.
You're fucking paranoid, man.
Come on, what are you doing?
Sonny, what the fuck are you doing?
You think that's gonna save me?
You think that's gonna save my life?
You think Paul doesn't talk to the cops?
- I ain't scared of them.
- Yeah?
Maybe you should be.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
TANG:
Do you remember what he looks like?
His eyes, a lot of hate.
And his hair was curly,
like all the boys wear.
- We're off the case.
- What?
I got a call on the way over here.
Why?
Are you serious?
That white guy right there,
he's gonna be on the
front page tomorrow.
Hey, Fu Manchu, take a hike.
(SIREN WAILING)
WOMAN: I hear there's a
dead body in there, though.
Damn it!
Yeah, yeah. I know, man.
I know how you feel.
Egg roll?
PAUL: I heard there was
a problem at Tien Chau.
I CHUNG: Fucking Steven.
He's got a death wish.
PAUL: When the time is right,
let's make it come true.
BLOOM: You look just like your picture.
Agent Bloom, FBI.
And I know who you are.
And what you do here, and in Guatemala
and in Singapore, Hong Kong.
Anywhere you need to send
your Chinese illegals. I know.
Clients, Agent Bloom.
They're my clients.
I know about every pisshole
you use to get your clients
into this country.
You like to read? I do. Helps me sleep.
A famous Frenchman, he said,
"Behind every fortune there's a crime."
Now that, I don't know,
but one thing I have learned.
The FBI, men like you,
takes a lot of money to catch someone.
Me?
I'm just a small potato.
Yours is like any other business,
you do a good job,
people tell their friends.
You've got a lot of happy
customers out there.
That's for sure.
But there's always gonna be some
unhappy ones, and all I need is one.
You see, in this country,
the people who stick around, they know.
They don't need to get revenge.
They just call me.
I got you.
Hey.
Hold on, will you? Stop.
Hey, hey.
Tell me what the DA said.
Depending on the information,
she might consider dropping the charges.
What information do you have?
The White Tiger, the one that
was killed in the safe house?
You got to be kidding me.
Tina, they'll kill you for that.
What am I supposed to do,
watch while my father dies in prison?
Come on.
Testifying against the Dragons
will get your father out,
but then you get on
a bus, you disappear.
Promise me you'll do that.
Sonny, I...
Thank you.
Make sure they guarantee.
Witness Protection.

PROSECUTOR: Anybody else?
Anybody else, Miss Sham?
Hiu Man Tang. Sonny Tan.

Don't turn your back on the

- JUDGE: Sit down!
(GAVEL POUNDS)
She identified them.
Barely.
SONNY: They promised to put
Tina in Witness Protection.
They promised.
ATTORNEY: The DA thinks Tina Sham
would never make it through trial.
She's dropping the case.
Your boys are free to go.
Nice work, Moss. Good to see
you finally earning your money.

TEDDY: Dear daughter, take this money
and start something new
and exciting with your life.
I'm sorry I was not a better
father to you and Ricky,
I hope you will remember the happy times
we had as a family in Hong Kong.
Love, Baba.
Everyone has responsibility.
Captain leads, sailor sails.
Green Dragons, I've never interfered,
but this I will not accept!
Her brother saved my life!
They're watching you now!
Probably listening to your phone calls!
We built this.
With our own hands.
Get rid of the girl.
Captain leads.
Sailor sails.
PAUL: When I was six,
my father took me far into
the forest and left me there.
Without food, without water.
First two days, I cry and I cry.
Then, I started to understand
the beauty of forest.
How big it was. How small I was.
Soon I come to road, truck take me home.
Neither father or mother
say anything to me.
Not a word.
I loved them even more after that,
because they show me
how strong I can be.
(SCREAMING) No!
- Bo ying.
- No!
- SONNY: No!
- Shoot.
(CHICKEN WING SPEAKING CANTONESE)
SONNY: (IN ENGLISH) Please, no!

REPORTER:
And in The People v. John Gotti,
the public may be given a rare
window into the inner workings
of one of New York's original
top five Mafia families.
Prosecutors are expected to
call several star witnesses
including Salvatore
"Sammy the Bull" Gravano,
who may be breaking his Cosa Nostra oath
in order to testify against
Gotti and the entire family.
NEWSCASTER: In related news,
authorities in Flushing
are calling the death of Wilson Yu
part of an ongoing war
between rival gangs
the Green Dragons and the White Tigers.
No arrests have been made.
The investigation continues.
Where's Paul?
(SHOUTING)
Tell me! Where the fuck is he?
He's gone. Back to the old country.
Why?
Why do you bring us here?
Maybe you're young,
so you don't understand.
We all come here willing to
be servants for our children.
I died many times, Sonny.
In the name of America.
(GUN CLICKS)
That look... I know it so well.
The hate, it's what this
country's built on.
Look at me, Sonny! Remember...
I am the American dream.
TANG: You think of anything, call me.
I CHUNG: If any of you had
told me we'd be here today,
talking about doing
business the new way,
I'd shoot you dead.
No offense, I Chung,
but where is Paul, hmm?
How do we know you're not
gonna rat us out to the cops?

And that lady who's
running things? Passports.
The ink hasn't even dried yet.
Nice work. You hear anything
about Paul, you call me, okay?
Paul's the boss, yeah.
But it's bigger than business,
bigger than family. He's our religion.
And now Chung is gonna replace him?
There's a storm coming, Detective,
and I don't know of any umbrella
that's gonna keep this city dry.
Not how these guys play.
What do you know about
