PART ONE: OUR RESUME
EX-CHIEF, HAMAMURA FAMILY
MASUO GUNJI
<i>A bitter wind blew</i>
<i>as I walked out after ten years.</i>
- Bro!
- Bro!
<i>Blood brothers</i>
<i>from my former family...</i>
<i>Ozaki, my right-hand man,</i>
<i>Shark, a weepy lush.</i>
Long stretch.
Sorry, bro.
This is the best we can do right now.
Idiot.
We lost our organization
and our territory.
What's to apologize?
But, bro...
So, what've you been up to?
What?
How you gettin' by?
This and that.
Nothing worth discussing.
Bro, the docks aren't
what they used to be.
<i>The harbor had indeed changed.</i>
<i>The old yakuza were lying low.</i>
<i>Daitokai, a Tokyo organization</i>
<i>that had barged in,</i>
<i>ran the dock labor out of</i>
<i>a front that passed for legit.</i>
DAITOKAI BOSS
EISAKU OBA
<i>The boss, Oba...</i>
DAITOKAI CHIEF
SHIGERU KAIZU
<i>His right-hand man, Kaizu...</i>
<i>In fact, the collapse of our organization</i>
<i>hung on their schemes.</i>
The boss is probably
turning over in his grave.
If only he'd listened
to your warning and kicked
Daitokai in the teeth back then.
Don't whine.
You had their number.
They'd schemed to get
control of the docks
by pitting us against Kohokukai.
<i>They were right.</i>
<i>They'd duped our boss,</i>
DAITOKAI FORMS AN ALLIANCE
WITH HAMAMURA FAMILY
<i>then barged into Yokohama,</i>
<i>pitting us against Kohokukai,</i>
<i>the other waterfront gang.</i>
<i>Kohokukai had Kudo,</i>
<i>a razor-sharp chief.</i>
KOHOKUKAI CHIEF
NOBORU KUDO
<i>We struck first and did their boss in.</i>
<i>Once the cops got involved,</i>
<i>Oba had the balls to say...</i>
I understand how you feel.
But you keep this up,
coppers'll be eating you for lunch.
About time for a truce.
I don't give a fuck!
<i>I went after Kohokukai alone.</i>
Bastard!
Darling!
<i>The woman's history, too.</i>
<i>She was gone with a postcard</i>
<i>that read, "Don't look for me."</i>
Hey, Shark. Give me a light.
Bro.
What do you think, bro?
You're not going to go it alone
like you did ten years ago.
I just got out.
Don't intend to go back.
What's up
with the rest of the crew?
Every man for himself.
We're the only ones left
kickin' around the docks.
"Lonely at night? Give me a call."
Stop! Hold it right there!
Let go of me!
EX-HAMAMURA FAMILY MEMBER
AKA "GUNSHOT"
<i>If your lover</i>
<i>Dumps you</i>
Hot! That's hot, damn it!
I'm sorry.
Watch it, Susumu!
EX-HAMAMURA FAMILY MEMBER
SUSUMU SEKI
Hey.
Shuddup.
Honey...
I'll get you some chocolate later.
How dare you!
EX-HAMAMURA FAMILY MEMBER
AKA "OLD MAN"
Be great to see 'em.
Bring the guys over tonight.
Tonight... here?
Yeah.
See ya.
Bro! Where to?
I'll tell you later.
What? Gunji's here?
What's he want?
Says he's come to pay respects
after his release.
What should I say?
Can't refuse his respects, I guess.
Send him in.
Please excuse my long absence.
Thanks to you,
I was released today.
I look forward
to your continued support.
Thanks for your respect.
Let's drop the formalities.
Have a seat.
That was a long stretch you did.
The odd terms on which we parted
have troubled me.
You can always come to me
with any problem.
Thank you.
Not to impose on your generosity,
but I do have a request.
Huh.
After that fiasco,
the gang scattered to the winds.
We never observed the Seventh
Anniversary of the boss's death.
Now that I'm back,
we want to hold a memorial.
I'm counting on your support.
So, what do you want from me?
Five million.
That's a hefty funeral donation.
My passionate boys
will gather for the occasion.
They all worked hard,
ten years ago,
taking those bullets for you.
The five million donation
would express your appreciation
for those services.
Sounds a bit like extortion.
Don't tell me
you're here to pick a fight.
Must be...
your guilty conscience talking.
- The fuck!
- Throw 'im out!
Just hold it!
First time anyone's leaned on me.
I like your nerve.
Give him the money.
What do you say
you come work with us for a while?
We'll treat you well.
Thank you.
But from here on out,
we only lay our lives
on the line for our own.
I see.
<i>The gambit paid off.</i>
<i>But the real work still lay ahead.</i>
Who's that?
Freeze!
Kudo.
Kudo, it's you!
You... Gunji!
What the hell
are you doing here?
Bro.
Kudo... right?
Those wounds are bad.
Word on the street.
Kudo just went after Oba.
Oba?
Get us out of here!
I want you to know,
the drugs'll cost you.
He's got holes
in more than his stomach.
Meaning?
Right here.
Looks like he's in remission,
but he pushes too hard,
and he'll slip right back.
I'm off.
I'd heard they suspended
his term two years ago
'cause he was sick.
No idea he was gunning for Oba.
I know how he feels.
He was always like that.
Not cut out for modern yakuza work.
Come to think of it,
we're just like him.
No way we can
carve out new turf now.
That's right.
Only giants like Daitokai survive.
Muscle your way in,
cops are all over you
like flies after honey.
Strange setup.
If it was still a free-for-all
like after the war...
Man, those were good times.
There might just be one place.
In all of Japan,
there's one place left
for grabbing new turf,
like we did back then.
Where?
Here.
Okinawa!
A new guy rolled into the joint.
Out of Okinawa.
Listening to him,
I figured we were on.
Sure it's rough.
But I say we gamble on those dice.
Beats sitting around waiting
to sink into the muck.
That's why I brought you here.
Money we've got.
Grudge money.
Took it off of Oba.
Oba?
These funds are for your grudges too.
We split it fair and square.
Anyone who wants out
takes his share and splits.
I'll do Okinawa alone if I have to.
Shit, bro! Count Gunshot in.
- I'm in, man!
- In!
- Me too.
- Not you, Old Man.
Your kid and your old lady...
Don't leave me out.
I'm in, too.
We're not betting our lives.
It's more like an out-of-town job.
You, Ozaki?
You know I'm with you.
But, bro...
what about our patient?
Can't forget him.
Sooner or later Daitokai'll get him,
if the cops don't nab 'im.
No way, Gunji.
Long as I'm alive,
I'm gonna bust Oba.
And you and I still have
our own score to settle.
I know that.
But listen.
Say you die hitting Oba.
Who's left to celebrate?
Wasn't born to live long!
What the hell would you know
about my kinda guts?
Gunji,
looks like you dragged in trouble.
No point stirring things up.
Just hand him over.
Shit!
What would you do?
Leave him to his fate?
What?
The man's life is mine.
Bullshit!
Over my dead body!
Take us all down with you?
All down?
You could take him alone,
but every last one of us?
Not even Daitokai
can pull that off unharmed.
Guts, you've got.
Tonight you can save face.
Just remember,
there's a score to be settled.
Shit! Stop!
Just fainted.
Looks like
he's hitched a ride to Okinawa.
PART TWO: OUR TURF
Damn it's hot!
Hey, can you thread this needle?
Brought your wife along?
Idiot!
You were right, bro.
It's just like Yokohama was.
There they are.
There they are.
What?
Pretty damned cool.
Jerk!
Get serious.
From what we figured out,
there's two big organizations
here in Naha.
The one that operates off the profits
from running the waterfront
is called Hadelma.
He's got about 100 men.
NAHA DOCK BOSS - HADELMA
The other,
Gushken, runs the bars, cabarets,
and whorehouses downtown.
About 60 men.
NAHA DOWNTOWN BOSS - GUSHKEN
Gushken lives off the whiskey
he smuggles from the base.
Sells it off for a huge profit
to all the dens on his turf.
The middleman between
the Yanks and Gushken
is this broker, Kusakabe.
Came over from the mainland.
BROKER-KUSAKABE
Besides Hadelma and Gushken,
there are some punk gangs
runnin' around,
but they've got no set turf.
But this guy everybody
calls Mad Dog Jiro
has got about 10 guys
covering this area.
MAD DOG JIRO
Mad Dog's not from Naha.
His big brother Yonabal's
the big cheese down in Koza City.
Jiro's here in Naha
'cause his brother's eyeing it.
KOZA DOWNTOWN BOSS -YONABAL
That's the lay of the land.
Where do you say we jump in?
How's about we steer
clear of the pros
and start with Kusakabe?
You Kusakabe?
Yeah.
In the flesh.
What do you guys want?
We want you to take us to Carter.
Carter?
Foreigner?
Wouldn't know.
Don't hold much truck
with those outsiders.
- Wake the fuck up, asshole!
- I'll blast ya!
- What are you -
- We know the score.
You work with Carter running
American whiskey to Gushken.
American whiskey? Me?
Absurd!
I'm a legit busine-
Get outside!
What are you doing?
I never asked you for protection,
and you want half of the whiskey
and the gambling business.
Go wash your faces in miso soup.
Keep that up
and we'll rat on you to the MPs.
And not just you guys.
That Morrison who lifts it off the base -
he'll get it too.
What's half against
the whole damn operation?
Before I answer,
I need Morrison in the discussion.
I'll go with him, too.
Shark.
Bro.
Something stinks.
Tools?
I'm packin'.
Blade.
Bro.
You keep it.
But, bro!
I said keep it.
Duck!
Shit!
Motherfucker!
Gunshot!
Bro!
Move it!
Stop dicking around!
Gunshot!
Gunshot got hit?
Yeah.
Goddamn it!
Bro, caught these guys
slinkin' around outside.
They sent in pros.
Bastard!
I agree
to your terms. You run this place.
But you better give me half-
Stuff it!
- Ozaki!
- Don't stop me, bro!
I'll kill 'em!
What'd we come here for?
You gotta take it.
You Morrison?
Listen up.
Cops get wind
of what went down tonight,
and we'll drag you down with us.
Got that, you son of a bitch?
<i>Two days later,</i>
<i>a Gushken punk came by.</i>
Got it.
Club Gajyumaru, right?
9:00 tonight.
Tell 'em we're definitely on.
So they finally came knocking.
Gushken's whiskey dried up
and he's whining.
If Hadelma's with 'em,
they'll probably
join forces and shove.
What's our plan?
I'll figure it out there.
Not alone, bro?
No, you don't. I'm with you.
- Bro! Me, too.
- Me too!
I've got a plan. Leave it to me.
I'm here too.
I thought I told you
to come alone.
Shut up and take us in.
What's this?
I'm here all on my lonesome.
Put that away.
We just want to talk.
Let's talk.
I got one thing to say.
Get the fuck outta Okinawa!
Who the fuck are you guys, anyway?
Luck ran out on the mainland?
Well, you're not gonna mess
around here in Okinawa!
Say something, goddamn it!
You guys
with some mainland organization?
No connection.
What's it to you?
It's just...
in that case, you'd do well
to reconsider this whole thing.
Who gives a fuck!
Makes no difference if they're
with some mainland family or not.
Go back to the mainland
or I'll kill ya!
Anything else to say?
Got a problem?
Mr. Hadelma... right?
You're crazy.
What are you trying to do?
We just took over Gushken's turf.
And what's your plan?
Me...
I'm not like Gushken.
I'm not stupid enough
to cross swords
with lunatic mainlanders.
Rat on us to the cops?
Also a possibility.
Only if you mean to go down
with my daredevils.
Just because
you're horning in on Gushken's turf,
it's got nothing to do
with my harbor operations.
And what about if I come
after you and your harbor?
Sparks fall on a man, he's got
to brush 'em off now, doesn't he?
Time for you to go.
Saved me there.
Now I've paid you back.
How're your wounds?
What about Hadelma?
I don't do things halfway.
We're into it now.
I say go all the way.
Took the words outta my mouth.
<i>Thus we came</i>
<i>into our first new turf.</i>
<i>The whiskey business</i>
<i>we'd taken off of Gushken</i>
<i>was flowing nicely.</i>
<i>Of course there were risks.</i>
<i>A few gutsy Gushken boys</i>
<i>tried coming after us.</i>
<i>Mere stragglers, really,</i>
<i>lost without their chief.</i>
<i>A few stray punks</i>
<i>came to mark their turf.</i>
Bastards!
<i>But we specialize in that sort of thing.</i>
<i>We all sprang back to life.</i>
<i>Then, one day,</i>
<i>just after we'd gotten settled,</i>
<i>a little squabble at a brothel</i>
<i>over protection money...</i>
<i>Darling!</i>
Bro,
we'll go take a little walk.
Do you know him?
Something about my face?
No.
It's just you look so much like her.
Your girlfriend?
Mister...
why don't you come in?
What's wrong?
You cheating?
No, that was ten years ago.
Ten...
ten years?
I thought I'd forgotten her.
Won't you tell me about her?
Nothing to tell, really.
Had to do a little time,
and when I'd finished,
she was gone.
That's all there is.
That's all?
She was from Okinawa, too.
No family.
Told me it was always warm,
the sea was gorgeous...
and also...
that she grew up so poor
she hardly ate when she was a kid.
Mainland life didn't agree with her.
She always stayed in her room,
never wanted to go out.
Watching TV.
Never knowing
when you'd come home,
always just waiting.
With someone like that,
why do things
you have to go to jail for?
Excuse me.
Don't tell me -
No, wrong person.
That's right. That's them.
Not now, not here.
Fuck it! I'll kill 'em!
No, it's just a matter of time.
You're the one who'll do it.
Then take over Gushken's turf
and you're made.
You can almost taste it.
You sure you're not aiming
to head back to the mainland?
- No way.
- You sure?
Yeah. Booze is cheap and good.
The ladies are fine.
Feels just like heaven here.
Sure happy I came.
What the fuck was that?
Think I'm gonna let you
act tough on my turf?
Fine, step outside!
Fuckin' bastards!
Let's get it over with!
Unlike you ugly bastards,
we got ladies to get back to.
Hold it!
I'll take you.
But I hate mainlanders.
So no mercy here.
For a country bumpkin,
you sure talk a good line.
Shit!
Bro!
What the fuck is this?
Actin' like you're still
some teenage punk!
Brother, I can explain -
Idiot! Don't "brother" me.
See why you got no turf of your own?
But listen!
He's part of that mainland gang
that washed up here.
Brother,
I'll take care of this punk,
then I'll snag Gushken's turf.
It's worth it
just for the whiskey trade
they took off those barbarians.
Brother,
I even went
and made a deal with Hadelma.
The truth?
I swear.
Jiro,
all the more reason
to go after the boss first.
Here we go!
Let's see what -
Who the fuck are you?
Seki!
Bastards!
You did this?
We take the trouble
to deliver your wounded,
and instead of gratitude, you let loose.
Are those mainland manners?
What are you gonna
do about it, Yonabal?
Yonabal?
You know me?
The one-armed giant,
Koza's boss.
I see.
You must be the hotshot
that hit Gushken.
Your business?
No mainlander
struts around my Okinawa.
This place is ours.
The place belongs
to whoever the fuck takes it.
Jiro.
Pull out.
Bro, no way.
We can't back out of this!
I gotta kill the bastard!
Look after him.
You okay, Seki?
You jerk!
I told you to stay out of petty fights.
Don't you get it?
Could cost you a finger.
I'm sorry.
What a waste.
Wipe it up.
You've sure got guts.
What's next?
Yonabal's a worthy enemy.
Six of us, counting me.
Plenty.
Brother, why didn't you
shoot 'em up back there?
We could've nailed 'em all!
Jiro!
Didn't you even see
the guy in the next room
with a clear shot at my belly!
Really?
You settle this score on your own.
If it gets out you leaned on me
for help, you'll never live it down.
What I'll do is
send ten tough guys
from Koza for backup.
Brother,
I swear I'll pull it off.
Jiro.
One last thing.
Don't confuse their small numbers
with weakness.
They've got real guts.
If you're not careful,
you'll wind up like Gushken.
Thanks for coming.
Seki, look out!
Watch it!
Son of a bitch!
Old Man!
Old Man!
Old Man!
Shit!
Bastards!
Asshole!
Come on, Shark!
Shit!
Brother!
You bastard!
You're all dead men.
You're going with us.
Brother, forget about me!
Shut up!
Bro,
you're still cool...
Old Man!
Hang in there!
Bro...
I had a really good time.
Just... my wife and...
child...
Old Man! Old Man!
You bastards!
Shark!
Let him go.
Bro!
No!
I won't!
Bro!
Just cut 'im loose.
Brother.
Why'd you help Jiro?
Why didn't you kill him?
Who gives a damn!
Let's get this fight over with.
I'll spare your lives.
But get the fuck outta Okinawa!
No way in hell.
Not even if you blast us!
You've got guts.
I'll take Jiro back to Koza.
We won't be coming back to Naha.
<i>My parents and family</i>
<i>In my beloved homeland</i>
<i>I yearn for the south seas</i>
<i>To carry me back to you</i>
<i>I sleep and wake to the dawn light</i>
Shut the fuck up!
I don't understand
a fuckin' thing she's singin'!
Sing a Japanese song.
A goddamn Japanese song!
Shark.
Shark!
Cut the crap!
That song
can't bring back our dead!
All right.
All right.
Let's sing.
We'll sing together.
<i>Watch me pull off</i>
<i>The desperate dream</i>
<i>Of which I'll never speak</i>
<i>I'm bound to make it come true</i>
<i>I'll see it through</i>
<i>I'll never give in</i>
Hey.
It's started up again.
What's the song about?
Why?
I don't know.
Seems like the perfect song
for our situation.
No wonder.
It's the migrant workers' song.
Migrant workers?
For the men
who left Okinawa
to work in the south seas.
"In the first weeks of spring...
when the flowers bloom...
we'll return home to Okinawa...
rich and dressed in gold."
Okinawa's very poor,
so men and women alike
have moved away to find work.
Just like your girlfriend did.
I wanted,
if I could've,
to go to the mainland myself.
But I've got family
that depends on me,
so here I am, stuck.
This is the best I can manage.
If you'd like,
think of your old girlfriend.
<i>Not long after that,</i>
<i>we moved into new digs.</i>
<i>A hip joint, complete</i>
<i>with golf course and pool.</i>
<i>But we'd settled</i>
<i>into a nasty frame of mind.</i>
<i>Felt like we'd lost</i>
<i>what mattered most.</i>
<i>Then one day</i>
<i>they arrived.</i>
PART THREE: VENGEANCE
Give me the camera.
Bro.
Well, well.
I hear you're raking it in.
I'll be taking Daitokai around.
We appreciate your cooperation.
I'd heard
about the good thing
you've got going here.
Had no idea you kept him
hanging around.
Let's go.
So Daitokai finally showed up.
A whole new ball game
from guys like Gunji's drifters.
We don't watch our step,
we could lose the whole game.
Contact them
at their hotel immediately.
Quite the gorgeous display.
It's called Kadesa.
A dance to welcome visitors.
Quite an honor.
Speaking of which,
may I ask what you hope for?
That we form an alliance,
and you cooperate
in our Okinawan ventures.
Your terms?
You now control
only part of the dock business.
If we work together,
we can sew up
all the dock work here in Naha.
Meaning that even
if we go fifty-fifty,
you'll still see twice the profits
you currently enjoy.
A win-win situation,
don't you think?
I see.
But if that's what
you came here to discuss,
why bother dragging
all your troops along?
Well, well.
If only everyone were
as perceptive as you.
There are those
of less intelligence, like him.
Hadelma...
you're showin' your age.
Fifty of these guys show up
and you freak out
and hurry over to kowtow.
Your days are numbered.
You'd better retire and leave
your gang in Jiro's hands
for your own sake.
Mr. Yonabal,
shouldn't you consider
your surroundings?
Surroundings?
I thought this was Okinawa.
Tell me if I'm wrong.
Don't tell me we've got
somebody important here.
Chill.
You guys fuckin' blind?
You Daitokai's guard dog?
Let me warn you.
You better cut the crap
and get the fuck back to the mainland.
Otherwise,
it's gonna start raining
blood around here.
Wow.
You're up to all that?
You tellin' me I'm not?
Try pulling that monkey business
parading around town
again tomorrow.
I swear to God
I'll bust it up with a bazooka.
Catch you later.
Jiro.
That stubborn bunch
requires our prompt attention.
Mr. Kudo.
What are you -
I'll pull out.
Wait.
I know how you feel.
But we're not exactly strangers.
I'm breaking my promise to you
and charging Naha tomorrow.
My targets are Daitokai
and that Hadelma.
Whose side you on?
Daitokai, right?
Japanese stickin' together?
No, not Daitokai.
And why the hell is that?
A pal of mine had his gang
crushed by Daitokai.
Nearly lost his life.
A pal of mine had his gang
crushed by Daitokai...
and lost ten years of his life.
All of us
have eaten dirt, thanks to them.
We didn't come here
and put ourselves on the line
to wag our tails at Daitokai.
Suit yourself.
Tomorrow you'll see what
Okinawan yakuza are made of.
Strange.
But knowing this world,
something tells me we'll end up allies.
Not a word.
Brother! Stay back!
We're outta here.
Bro!
<i>Strange.</i>
<i>Just as I'd begun thinking</i>
<i>about taking on</i>
<i>Daitokai with the man.</i>
It's all about reading the times.
If you can't see what's coming,
you die young.
So what are your plans?
Quietly accept
our outstretched hand,
fight to the death
and die in the gutter,
or hand over your turf and split.
The choice is yours.
If you walk out,
we're prepared to respond in kind,
and we're willing to let Kudo go.
Respond in kind, meaning?
Money, of course.
Though you won't get your way
as you did with that
outrageous funeral donation.
All right. We leave quietly.
Bro!
You set the price.
Just what I expected
from such a clever man.
Here's what we'll do.
You get two million.
And a million each for those three.
Which brings us to the same
five million from Yokohama.
Works for you?
This time
we really split the dough.
Bro!
What do you say?
That's for Old Man's family.
Bro, you really callin' it quits
after losing three good men?
Say something, bro!
Bro!
Cut it out.
That's enough!
We'll be going then, bro.
Let's go.
We're going.
The words sound different.
They are.
I sing a whore's version.
Want to know what it means?
Yeah.
"When will the time come
when a woman's -
When a woman's other lips can speak?
If they only could,
they would speak
of all the sorrow she's seen."
Even if you heard it,
you probably wouldn't understand.
Besides, you're a man.
You may be right.
You're...
not coming back, are you?
No.
I doubt I'll be seeing you again.
Money.
No matter how much
a woman loves me,
this is all I can do for her.
It's always been like that.
Will she speak...
of all the sorrow she's seen?
I always know what you're up to.
Bro, don't say a word.
Hello, boss. Welcome.
Come this way.
Name's Hadelma. Welcome.
I'm Oba. Looks like
we'll be relying on you.
Not at all. This way, please.
Nice harbor you got here,
Mr. Hadelma.
Things could get really interesting.
The best thing about the dock work
is all the cheap labor.
Exactly as you say.
Temperate climate
and the sea's beautiful.
Good place for a long life.
After you.
Come on!
Damn it!
Wait!
THE END
