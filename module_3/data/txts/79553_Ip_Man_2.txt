Thanks to his friend Chow Ching-Chuen, the wounded Ip Man
and his wife escaped from his occupied hometown of Foshan.
Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster
Hong Kong, 1950
Here we are, Brother Ip.
Sorry for all the hassle.
Not at all.
We're from the same village.
It's only been empty for a few months.
I talked to the neighbors.
They're very nice.
Thanks so much, Kan.
Let's see if it's suitable
for your martial arts club.
Wow, this place is huge!
Is it big enough?
Yes, yes.
It's very spacious.
Day 8
Master Ip.
You haven't recruited
any pupils yet?
What's the matter, Auntie?
You've got so much space.
Can I dry my clothes here?
Please go ahead.
Wing Sing!
I told you to leave
the heavy stuff to me!
I don't know what to do with you.
There'd be no more water
if I'd waited for you.
Next time I'll come sooner, all right?
I told you not to exhaust yourself.
Are you all right? Feeling better?
Mom, I need to pay my
school fees in two days.
Ok, hang on.
Who is it?
Time to pay your rent!
Mr. Ip! Mrs. Ip!
Don't open the door!
We don't have enough money.
Mr. Ip! Mrs. Ip!
Day 9
No pupils yet, Master Ip?
I'll dry my clothes then.
Auntie.
Let me help you.
- You help me?
- It's no big deal.
Thank you very much!
Hey, are you the one
teaching Wing Chun?
Master! Someone wants
to learn martial arts!
- You want to learn martial arts?
- Maybe. I don't know what Wing Chun is.
Let me give you an introduction.
Wing Chun is a close combat
style from the South...
No need to tell me all this.
Let's just fight.
I'll pay you school fees if I lose.
Okay.
Wing Chun. Ip Man.
What do you think?
You haven't beaten me yet.
Do you yield?
Yield? I don't even
know what you're doing.
Do you know now?
Master Ip,
I never knew you were so good!
Incredible!
Hey, young man, hurry and
accept him as your master!
You can pay me the
school fees now, right?
Why are you leaving, young man?
What to do now, Master Ip?
You finally get a potential pupil,
and now he's gone!
That's him.
Can this old man be any
good at martial arts?
Are you kidding me?
He looks totally harmless.
He actually resembles a laundry man.
You're not really here
to learn martial arts.
Go away!
Okay!
We're challenging you to a fight!
No need to take those off.
What are you talking about?
Nothing.
"Asking Hand."
I told you not to take
your clothes off.
Master!
Please accept me,
Wong Leung, as your pupil!
In that case...
Master!
I'm Tsui Sai-cheung.
- Ngai Kwok-hing.
- Wong Kwun.
Please accept us as your pupils!
I'm his first pupil.
You call me Big Bro.
Pour some tea for the Master.
Forget the ceremony!
Pay your school fees first.
Wing Chun combines attack
and defense in one motion.
Attack and defend.
To beat an opponent
as quickly as possible.
Look! This is "Dispersing Hand."
"Dispersing Hand."
Simultaneous defense and attack.
Understand?
Who is Master Ip?
Master!
Leung! Did you get them to come?
Master, can you beat ten
men at the same time?
The best thing is
not to fight at all.
Continue practicing.
But what if ten men
come with weapons?
Run.
You should collect
school fees from them.
I know.
You always say that.
I'll collect from them later.
Stop for a minute.
What's the matter?
It's time to pay your school fees.
What is it?
Time to pay your school fees.
Whoever has cash can pay me first.
Master...
Master, I can only pay 2 dollars today.
My mom is... short of cash.
I'll pay the rest next time.
Next time, then...
- Master, I don't have enough.
- Next time, then!
Go home and eat!
Thank you, Master!
There's so little...
What should we do?
I can't help it.
You know the economy is bad.
When my pupils ask me to help out,
as their master, I can't refuse.
We'd better ask the landlady
to give us more time.
Yes, ask her to give us some help.
You help us, we help you.
Everything will be ok.
Excuse me, two pieces of cake, please.
You want an egg tart?
No thanks.
Stop! Hold it right there!
You dare to steal a roast duck?
Thief! Return it to me!
Please don't beat up my dad!
- Pay up!
- I don't have the money!
I'll call the cops
if you don't pay up.
Please let him go!
Stop, stop! Don't beat him up.
What's happening?
He stole our roast duck!
- I'll pay for it!
- Give it here!
Let's go.
- Ching-Chuen?
- Uncle Man, I know where he's going.
Take me to him!
He's here.
Ching-Chuen.
Uncle Man,
he doesn't recognise anyone.
The Japanese put a bullet in his head.
He doesn't recognise anyone anymore.
Ching-Chuen.
Ching-Chuen, I'm Ip Man.
- Ching-Chuen...?
- Scram, you Jap!
- Ching-Chuen, I'm Ip Man!
- Scram, you Jap! Scram!
Scram! Scram!
Let's go, Uncle Man.
- This is my fault.\N\N\N
- This is my fault.
- It's not your fault, Uncle Man.
Let's go.
He'd rather be homeless
than come with me.
So I stay here to keep him company.
When I can find some
work at a restaurant,
I bring him leftovers to eat.
Otherwise, he would go hungry.
Don't worry, Yau.
We'll take care of your dad together.
Since you are recommended by Master Ip,
I'll definitely hire you.
If you agree to half salary,
you can start now.
No problem.
Have a seat.
I'll arrange work for you.
Please stay, Ip.
Let's have some tea.
- Thank you!
- You're welcome. Take a seat.
All right.
Thank you, Uncle Man.
You'd better work hard, Yau!
I will.
"World Boxing Championship Tournament in Hong Kong"
"Learn Wing Chun Kung Fu"
Wanna learn Wing Chun?
I'll take you there later.
I practice Hung Kuen style!
I don't need to learn from you!
Since you aren't interested,
why tear my posters down?
I don't care what you learn.
Your sign was on top of my poster.
Want to know what Wing Chun is?
You're looking for trouble?
I'm not going to bully you.
One on one.
- You guys don't interfere.
- Okay!
And no eyes or throat!
Enough talk. I'm in a hurry.
- Do you yield?
- No!
No? Do you yield?
The Dipersing Hands should
stay in the center.
Relax.
Relax more.
Who is Ip Man?
What's the matter?
Your pupil Wong Leung
has injured our man.
He's in our hands.
Go pay your ransom at the fish market,
Lee Hung Kee.
Let's go.
"LEE HUNG KEE"
Kei!
You are his master?
That's right.
Mr...
I'm sure this is just
a misunderstanding.
Let's talk it over.
Can you release my pupil first?
Release him!
Leung, are you all right?
I'm fine.
Why did you injure him?
We sparred and he lost.
It's not my fault he
wasn't as good as me.
What did you say?
I'm not as good as you?
Take it easy!
You're all young men.
Injuries are inevitable
in friendly fights.
I'll visit your master
and explain to him.
May I know who your master is?
Doesn't matter.
He's better than you anyway.
Enough talk.
Did you bring the money?
No.
Take it easy.
Attack!
Master! Behind you!
Take him down!
- Master!
- Come!
Leung!
Master! I'm here!
Master, you really can
beat up more than 10 men!
Only if we can escape.
Follow my lead.
Follow me!
Leung, go.
Go!
Jin Shanzhau?
Nobody move!
What are you doing?
Master Ip, you are free to go!
Thank you!
Screw you!
Break it up!
Master!
Are you causing trouble again?
No, Master!
We were fighting...
and he brought his Master.
Jin Shanzhau!
You think you're in charge here?
No, of course not.
Master Hung, let's talk things over.
You want to talk with
a knife in your hand?
No, no.
This asshole stirred
things up on my turf.
That's why I...
What turf?
This road is mine,
so is that dump over there.
So you tell me, whose turf is this?
It's all Master Hung's!
On your way!
You have no business here!
Which school are you from?
Greetings Master Hung.
I'm Ip Man of the Wing
Chun sect from Foshan.
Please let me explain what happened.
Your pupil and mine were
involved in a friendly fight.
My pupil was too strong
for yours but he...
You mean Wing Chun is
better than Hung Kuen?!
That's not what I meant.
That's not what I meant, Master Hung.
Who allowed you to teach martial arts?
Do you know the rules?
I don't know of any rules.
You don't know? Let me tell you then.
You must accept anyone's challenge.
If you are unbeaten
when the incense burns out,
then you are qualified to teach.
Those are the rules of
the martial arts clubs.
Understand?
Cut the speech.
There are rules for martial arts schools,
and then there are rules of Law.
I'm arresting you two for assault.
Wan, Po! Take them into custody.
I have another pair here. Take him too.
- Me?
- Master!
- Go!
- Go!
Get moving.
Settle your affairs, and let's go in.
The Chief is waiting.
Sir!
He wants to know about
manpower and security.
Everything is taken care of.
No problem.
What will be my cut
from this competition?
Please excuse us a moment.
Let me handle it.
I know how to negotiate.
How much should we give him, boss?
Speak!
Are you going to tell me?
Don't worry.
The cops are just showing off.
Everything will be fine
once we make bail.
Master Jin,
I'm so sorry to have gotten
you involved today.
I'm so sorry to have
gotten you involved today.
Wait. I've been deaf in this ear since
you hit it last year. What did you say?
I said, I'm so sorry to have
gotten you involved today.
That's all right.
If you hadn't hit me with a rod
at the cotton mill that time,
who knows what I'd be doing now.
Police! Open up!
Open up!
What's the matter?
- Any of Ip Man's relatives here?
- I am his wife.
Your husband's been
arrested for assault.
Please bail him out
as soon as possible.
Mr. Leung?
Mr. Leung!
Mr. Leung!
What is it?
You have to help my husband.
I don't have enough
money to bail him out.
Wait here.
It's a pain in the ass to open
a martial arts school here!
Too many schools, masters, and rules.
And then there's this Mr. Hung.
He has too many men
and too much money!
So what? You wait and see.
I'll deal with him
once I'm out of here.
I'll destroy his fish stall
and poison all his fish!
Don't you see you sound
exactly like them?
Kid!
You were quite fierce when you fought.
I'm not a kid!
What make you think I'm a kid?
Leung! Watch your attitude!
Master Jin is your senior.
That's okay.
He's a young man after all.
Look at him.
He's just like me in the old days.
If you want him to turn out good,
find him a wife.
Like me,
wife, kids, family. It changed me.
I want to bail my husband out.
Who's your husband?
Ip Man.
Do you have the money with you?
Yes.
Ip Man.
You're free to go.
Hurry up!
I'm here to bail out Jin Shanzhau.
Honey!
Brother, open the door for me, please.
Quickly!
My wife.
Leung,
is someone going to bail you out?
No.
Don't worry, Master.
They'll release me in a few days.
You go on. Go.
I won't be able to see you out.
Kan,
I need to impose on you again.
I want to bail my pupil out.
Is that all right with you?
Brother Man,
I didn't bring enough money.
Master Ip!
Wait, Master Ip!
Honey, do you have any money?
What do you need it for?
It's an emergency.
You always say that. No!
Honey, please help these people out.
- Come on...
- Last time!
Mommy's the best!
Here's the money, Master Ip.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
Thank you.
Don't worry!
It's so difficult to open a school here.
Why don't you just give up?
I'm just going to visit
the other masters.
No big deal.
I don't want to worry about you,
like before.
We made it through the war,
there's nothing to worry about, right?
Don't dwell on it.
You had a hard day.
Go to sleep.
I've fought this type of matches
many times before.
But it wasn't stools underneath.
It was all knives!
Ip Man.
Have you heard of him before?
The name means nothing to me.
No, I haven't.
Who can be better than Master Law?
You're being modest, Master Cheng.
Are you going to go up?
If you'll go, I'll go.
Let's stop talking
and have some tea.
Cheers.
Master.
He's here.
Fellow Masters...
this is Ip Man.
He wants to teach martial
arts here in Hong Kong.
That's why he's here today,
to accept your challenges.
Ip Man.
If you surrender, you lose.
If you leave the table, you lose.
If you can remain on the table
until the incense burns out,
I'll call you Master Ip.
If there are no questions,
let us begin,
What, he's just going to
walk up to the table?
No style at all.
Greetings fellow masters.
I'm Ip Man...
of Foshan Wing Chun,
pupil of Chen Huashun.
I'm honored to meet you!
Which master wants to have a go?
Master Law, what are you waiting for?
Let's see who wants to go first.
Okay, I'll go first.
Please!
Please!
Twin Lightning Kicks.
Beware, brother!
Master Law, are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- Master...
If it were knives,
it would have been death.
One shouldn't fight like that.
Go away!
That table is very slippery.
Thank you!
Come on! Don't let it stop!
Master Cheng, your turn.
Please!
Master Cheng, go on.
Go on.
Master Cheng,
the table is very slippery.
Please!
Please!
Good!
Thank you for sparing me.
Thank you.
Any one else want to have a go?
Please!
Please!
Master Ip!
Master Hung!
Welcome to the martial arts society.
Don't forget to pay your monthly fees.
What monthly fees?
It's a rule. Everyone has to pay.
$100 a month.
It's for your protection.
If anyone still thinks
I'm not qualified,
then please challenge me.
But if this is to satisfy
your personal gain,
this I cannot accept.
It's up to you.
Don't come to me when
you're in trouble.
You can leave now.
Medicine.
Master, your medicine.
Are you insane?
Drawing these on my newspaper?
I just wanted readers to
understand the content better.
Has the response been bad?
Everyone in Hong Kong is talking
about Wing Chun vs Hung Kuen.
This is fantastic!
Keep writing in this style.
My paper depends on you.
Get back to work.
- Congratulations, Yau!
- Good Job!
- Well done!
- Nice going!
"WING CHUN VS HUNG KUEN: NO CLEAR WINNER"
Mei, stop doing your homework. Eat.
Let's eat.
Please give me some congee, Honey.
You've been eating less lately.
Come and eat.
- Where are you going?
- Are you blind?
I'm going up to do my laundry.
Are you really just
doing your laundry?
What do you think this big basin is for?
Washing my head?
151... 152...
Where are you going?
To learn Wing Chun.
- Wing Chun? It's not here.
- The newspapers say it's here.
No it's not. Go away!
You better learn Hung Kuen instead!
Hey!
Those scumbags won't let
others learn Wing Chun!
I dare you to come down!
What are you doing?
Are you deaf?
I said come down if you have the guts!
Come down if you dare!
Are you crazy?!
- You wanna die?
- Bunch of cowards.
Look, Wing Chun pupils!
- What are you doing?
- Get them!
They're coming down!
Get your weapons. Hurry up!
Come out!
The owners have reservations
after what happened today.
I understand.
They've decided not to lend
this place to you anymore.
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.
Sorry, but I have to go.
Farewell.
Bye, Kan.
Master...
Master...
I guess you know already?
We can't train here anymore.
Master, it's not our fault.
They started it!
They provoked us to go down.
Let's go and settle this!
No!
Master...
Tidy up the place before you go.
Bring the wooden dummies to my home.
Master...
Kei.
Give these to the pupils.
They've earned it.
Thank you, Master!
- Here's yours.
- Thank you.
Good work everyone.
How dare you come here?
I'm here to see your Master.
Kei.
Take a break.
What is it?
Your school's in a bit of a jam?
I'm here to tell you
though I've lost my school,
I will continue to teach martial arts.
And I'm not going to
pay you a single cent!
Don't harass my pupils
or cause any more trouble!
It's you who's causing me trouble now!
You don't follow the rules!
Without me dealing
with the foreigners,
how can martial arts clubs
continue to operate in peace?
You chose to collude
with the foreigners!
Ip Man, because you only
care about yourself,
you don't have 200 pupils
to feed and cloth.
You can ignore the foreigners
and act high and mighty!
I understand what you're saying.
We're all trying to survive.
But as masters, aren't we are obligated
to guide our own pupils first?
My conscience is clear!
Well at any rate...
if you have any other complaints,
come speak to me directly. Goodbye!
Hold it!
You can't leave just like that!
Well, what do you want?
We did not finish our match.
It's time to finish it!
Look out!
Honey, the girls have been
waiting here for a while.
They're hungry.
Are you done with your discussion?
Master Hung,
is this matter more important...
than to have dinner with your family?
What do you want to eat?
We want ice cream!
I'll buy you ice cream after dinner.
I won't keep you any longer,
Master Hung.
See you then.
- Master.
- Come in.
Come.
Put them over there.
Come, put them there.
Why did you bring the
wooden dummies back?
They've rented the
rooftop to someone else.
So I'm storing them here
for the time being.
OK...
Go home and rest.
We'll start training
here tomorrow morning.
Train here?
Yes! Come earlier tomorrow.
- Goodbye, Master.
- Goodnight everyone.
Master,
can I have a word with you?
Have some tea, Leung.
Come.
Sit.
Master,
it's my fault that
you lost the school.
I'm sorry.
Come.
Get up. Come.
Get up.
Sit down and we'll talk. Come.
Leung,
do you think I'm very skilful?
Of course. You can fight off
so many all by yourself.
What about twenty years later?
In twenty years' time,
you can easily beat me.
People grow old.
No one can remain
number one forever.
You have great potential
as a martial artist.
But, you only focus on the physical
and technical sides of fighting.
I want you to learn
Chinese martial arts,
because they incorporate
the capacity for self-cultivation
with its spirit.
We aim for balance,
striving effortlessly.
Do you understand?
I'm trying to...
You want to hear a story?
It's about Jin Shanzhau,
Master Jin?
One time...
I whipped his backside
with a broomstick.
He came to my home in Foshan
to challenge me to a duel.
And he started wreaking everything,
upsetting my wife really badly.
Are you practicing kung fu?
Yes, I'll teach you
when you grow up.
Let's go.
Master.
Carry on.
Fancy meeting you here.
I was in the neighbourhood.
What do you want, Master Hung?
I have extra tickets, and wondered
if you'd like to attend too.
It's a Western boxing match.
Goodbye.
Master Hung.
Your eyes are red. Are you okay?
They've been like
that since I woke up.
Perhaps it's the heat.
I'll drink some cool tea.
This isn't a bad place
to teach martial arts.
Place three rows here.
Three rows over there too.
Hurry up.
Master Hung, come say hi.
I'll introduce you to
the boxing champion.


How are you?
Foreigners like to leave things around.
Ignore him.
How was your talk with the foreigner?
When are we getting our money?
He glared whenever I mentioned money.
It isn't going anywhere.
He wants you to work
for free this time.
For free?
We closed our fish stalls
to set this place up!
Don't be upset,
or else there'll be trouble.
Take it as going on a diet.
This isn't the first time.
Master Hong!
Sir.
I've heard your request,
but my men need to eat,
you have to pay them.
Don't speak to me about money now.
What else can I discuss with you?
Love?
Come!
Stop it.
Now you've pissed him off.
If he doesn't pay, we'll just quit!
If you quit, he'll take
away your fish stalls.
- Just bear with it.
- Bear with it?!
I've tolerated it for too long!
Shut your mouth, you foreign devil!
You heard him. Let's go.
We quit too! Let's go.
Let's go.
Wait!
Look, they'll get in
trouble because of you.
You guys stay and work.
Come on...
Don't be mad. Let's wait and see
how that asshole ends up.
- Master Ip.
- Master Hung.
Thank you for the tickets.
All the schools
are doing demonstrations.
Ask your pupils to
demonstrate their kung fu
so more people will know
about Wing Chun.
Alright.
I won't keep you.
- Hey, go get ready.
- Hey, get ready.
You go too.
Go demonstrate "Shaking Hands."
Let's go.
It all works out.
Listen, we had a few losses but
it's gonna publicize martial arts.
Bloody Foreign Devil!
Stop fighting! Stop it!
Stop fighting!
Stop fighting!
Stop fighting! Stop it!
What should we do?

Stop fighting! Stop it!
Stop fighting!
- Back off!
- Everybody, stop it!
Stop it! Stop fighting!
Calm down! Stop fighting!
Calm down!
Leung...
- Master
- Carry him down first.
Help me, Cham.
Gently, gently!
Master of Ceremony! Come here!
If you don't like our demonstration,
you were free to leave.
But you need to apologize
for insulting us!
I will fight him!
I'll beat him till
he apologizes to me!
Kill the foreign devil!
Fellow masters, leave this to me.
Everyone please stand down.
Okay! Let's go!
Right! Fight like that!
Master Ip. Leung is all right.
He's resting inside.
Thank you!
Master Hung!
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
In the next round, Master Hung,
instead of trading punches with him,
Attack his ribcage.
It won't be that easy.
Kick the foreign devil down!
Shit! Master's out of breath.
Master, sit down and rest a bit.
Stop fighting, Master Hung!
I can't let that foreign
devil insult us.
Don't get hurt for your pride!
I can abide in order to survive,
but I won't let him insult
Chinese martial arts!
Master! Master...
Master!
Master!
Master, yield!
Master...
Master Hung,
you'll always be my
most respected master.
HUNG KUEN GRANDMASTER DIES
IN WESTERN BOXING MATCH
GRANDMASTER HUNG DIED FOR HIS COUNTRY
WESTERN BOXING CHAMPION WAS A BULLY
- What's happening?
- Sit down!
None of your business.
Sit down.
Who's the editor-in-chief?
- What's the matter?
- Take him in.
No...
Sir...
It's not wise to beat him like that.
He will write a scathing report on us.
We need to get rid of him.
I know what to do. Let me handle it.
Fatso! You take care of him!

We Chinese burn incense
not only to keep time...
It's a Chinese tradition.
Other than measuring time,
it is to honour our ancestors.
It's the Chinese culture.
Mr. Miller...
I challenge you.
Chun, hurry up.
Don't let the landlady wait too long.
I'll take you there in a moment.
Mom, why are we staying
with the landlady?
Dad's practice will disturb the baby.
- Here, let me.
- Sorry for the trouble.
- It's no trouble. Come.
- Thank you.
- Let Chun carry the small one.
- Chun take this.
Mr. Ip, you must defeat
the foreign devil.
I'll bring these in.
Don't worry about us.
Concentrate on your training.
But don't practice too late.
You must win.
We have to go.
Goodbye.
I live alone.
Make yourselves at home.
You can sleep here.
Don't be scared. Keep writing.
Keep writing!
I'll still publish it tomorrow!
What's the matter?
Cops!
What are you writing?
Still writing?
You're not afraid to die?
"Wing Chun expert accepts challenge
to a Western boxing match".
Is that all?
Why not write that
"Western Dog will be Demolished"?
"Defend the news with our blood,
and expose the truth with our conscience."
You have conscience,
but do you have the truth?
I do!
If you got guts, I'll tell
you everything! Ruin him!
- Yeah...
- Come on
This foreign devil detests
and despises us Chinese.
I'll give you the goods, you report them.
he'll be finished.
What's the matter?
Mrs. Ip, what's the matter?
You're in labor!
Chun, call your dad right away!
No, I don't want to distract him.
Then I'll go get a midwife.
Chun, watch over your mom.
Master Zhang, over there!
The Chinese-Western Boxing Match
is about to commence!
The hall is packed with
locals and expats.
It's bustling with excitement.
There are both Chinese and Western
judges in the judging panel.
Hopefully it will be a truly
fair and impartial match.
Ladies and gentlemen,
do not leave your radio!
I tell you, he'll beat
him in three strikes.
No, he'll beat the foreign
devil in two strikes!
Master Ip,
your opponent is a boxing champion.
Are you convinced your
Wing Chun will prevail?
Master Ip, all Hong Kong
citizens are behind you.
Are you fighting for yourself or in
defense of Chinese martial arts?
Ladies and gentlemen...
The long-awaited Chinese-Western
boxing match is about to begin!
Let's welcome the boxing champion,
Twister!
Twister has come on stage.
Ip Man's eager to beat him down.
Master.
I want a clean fight.
When I say "fight", fight.
When I say "break", break.
You have to follow my instructions
at all time, is that clear?
Master Ip, beat him like you beat me!
- Anyone can beat you.
- Shut up!
Both of them are
sizing each other up.
Master!
Master Ip was knocked down!
They're going to start counting down!
Master!
Get up! Master Ip!
Looks like this punch was too strong.
Can Master Ip stand up?
Master Ip is ok! He's up!
Good!
Master Ip has knocked Twister down!
- Good work, Master!
- The foreign devil has stamina.
He's still standing after taking
so many hits from Master.
Master Ip is attacking
with a volley of punches!
Hey that's cheating!
That's unfair!
He hit after the bell rung!
Master! Master...!
According to the decision by the judges,
kicking is prohibited in this match.
If you don't agree,
you'll forfeit the match.
And Twister will be
announced the winner.
Is that clear?
Oh my God! Master Ip has been felled
by a knockout blow from The Twister.
Master, get up!
Get up! Get up! Get up!
Stand up! Master!
I can't let that foreign
devil insult us.
I can abide in order to survive,
but I won't let him insult
Chinese martial arts!
Master!
Master Hung, instead of
trading punches with him,
attack his ribcage.
It won't be that easy.
Daddy's won! Daddy's won!
- I know Master Ip!
- Who doesn't here?
Fok Yuen Kap, Wong Fei Hung,
Ip Man and I!
We're the Four Dragons of Foshan!
Hello...
By fighting this match,
I'm not trying to prove
Chinese martial arts
is better than Western boxing.
What I really want to say is...
though people may have
different status in life,
everybody's dignity is the same.
I hope that from this moment on,
we can start to respect each other.
That's all. Thank you.
Master Ip! Master Ip...
What are you going to do now?
I'm going home.
He takes after you.
What shall we name him?
How about Ip Ching?
I want him to become a righteous man.
Good!
He looks just like you!
Uncle Man, I just made a new friend.
He wants to learn kung fu from you.
He's outside.
Come in.
I want to learn from you.
How much?
What's your name?
Bruce Lee!
Why do you want to learn martial arts?
I wanna beat up people I don't like!
Very spirited.
Come back when you're older.
In 1956, 16 year-old Bruce
Lee became Yip Man's pupil.
Bruce Lee was deeply inspired by Master Ip and
based his martial arts on Wing Chun theories.
Ip Man spent the next 22 years teaching Wing
Chun and spreading it all over the world,
helping Chinese martial arts
to flourish everywhere.
