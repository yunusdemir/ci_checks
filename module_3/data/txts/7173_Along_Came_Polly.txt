REUBEN: I, Reuben, take you, Lisa...
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa,
to be my lawfully wedded wife.
I do.
- Lois, the room looks beautiful.
- Thanks.
The candles have been replaced
by the mini-lamps you asked for.
- So no fire hazard.
- Great. Did we sanitize these?
The best man is in the house!
(EXCLAIMING)
LOIS: Oh, my God!
REUBEN: Sandy, are you okay?
Jorgé, ice. The best man went down.
Dance floor's a Slip 'N Slide, dude.
I thought I told them
not to wax this.
23% of the guests are over 70.
I don't want anyone breaking a hip.
Don't worry,
I'm gonna take care of it.
I analyze risk for a living.
It's my job to worry.
Let me do the worrying,
because you got to get married.
I'm good.
You got my note that Harry Bard
at table 7's allergic to seafood?
His chicken will go nowhere
near the fish.
We're putting the finishing touches
on the cake.
This looks great.
Lisa is gonna love it.
This looks great.
Lisa is gonna love it.
Hit me, dude.
(EXCLAIMING) Aren't you that kid
from Crocodile Tears?
That's right. I'm Sandy Lyle.
I saw that movie in high school.
That bagpipe scene
was the funniest shit.
We had a good time on that picture.
Want an autograph?
No, thanks.
It's good to see you, man.
I thought you died 15 years ago.
Ah! Nah.
I'm very much alive.
I've been stage-acting.
- Getting back to my roots.
- We should...
They're making
an E! True Hollywood Story on me.
That'll clear up questions.
They're really doing a show
about your life?
I got a camera crew
following me the next few weeks.
- It's gonna be huge.
- Cool!
Reuben! Two-minute warning.
Lisa's on her way down.
Thanks.
- Look, Reuben.
- Yeah?
I'm asking you this
because you're my oldest friend
in the world.
- And I'm your wingman.
- Okay. What?
Are you sure you want to do this?
Sandy, there's not a doubt
in my mind.
Okay?
I found the perfect woman.
We're totally in love.
My life's working out
just like I planned.
Let's go get married.
MALE GUEST: Mazel tov!
Go on. Kiss each other.
Big smile, everyone!
Come on, you love each other.
Smile, Grandma.
Having fun.
(TRADITIONAL WEDDING MUSIC PLAYING)
(EXCLAIMING)
(LAUGHING)
Hello, everybody.
I'm Stan Indursky, Reuben's boss.
Thank you. You're very kind.
Now Reub's not the sort of fellow
to brag about his own success
so I'm going to do it for him.
The fact is this young man here,
is the best
risk assessment expert
in this whole meshugaas
we call the insurance business.
Irving, Vivian,
you've raised a wonderful son.
Let's hear it for him.
Reuben, Lisa, let me just say...
that I would insure your marriage
any day of the week.
Mazel, you two. Good things.
Oh, and, Lisa, don't tire him out
too bad on the honeymoon.
I need this kid fresh
when he gets back.
Mazel! Good things.
You know, the truth is,
I've been waiting for this day
my entire life.
About four-and-a-half years ago
I met a real-estate agent
named Lisa Kramer...
who showed me an apartment,
which I rented...
just so she'd go out with me.
- I gave him a good price.
- Not good enough. She's a killer.
No, seriously...
after about a month of dating,
I knew she was the one.
And I couldn't be happier
that on this day that I've been
dreaming about for so long...
the woman I'm standing next to
is you.
(ROMANTIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC

(UPBEAT CALYPSO MUSIC PLAYING)
LISA: Oh, my goodness!
REUBEN: Look at this place!
LISA: I lost my shoe!
- So pretty!
- It's beautiful.
- What?
- (BOTH SCREAMING)
(UPBEAT REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING)
- How's your bruise?
- It's okay.
You know, it's a little sore.
REUBEN: They really should tell you...
if they let Komodo dragons
run around the hotel.
Really.
Oh!
- How about this one?
- Let's see.
"Recently renovated colonial
in Montclair, three-bedroom..."
Sweetie, we took a virtual tour
of this one on the Internet.
It was perfect,
but just a little pricey.
Oh, right. That's right.
It's probably off the market anyway.
- Why do you say that?
- Because I bought it.
You what?
I bought it!
Reuben, I'm in shock.
You don't do things like that.
- You love it, right?
- I do, but, Reuby...
- We have a house!
- Oh, my God, we have a house! Honey!
(FRENCH ACCENT) Hi. Hello.
(FRENCH ACCENT) Hi. Hello.
(GASPS)
How's it going?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
It's going great. Thank you.
I see you gang
are new to the island,
I want to come have a meet with you.
I show you my boat. That is
my boat there on the sandbar.
It's very big.
Yeah, it's pretty good size.
So, tell me true,
are you guys for scuba?
What does that mean?
I'm the unofficial scuba king
of St. Barts.
So if you're for scuba,
I take you out on the boat,
I show you the coral reef
and we have like a scuba party?
That sounds great, but we're not
certified, so we'll have to pass.
That is no biggie.
I get you resort-certified...
couple of hours.
- I have always wanted to try it.
- Yeah?
Good. My name is Claude.
What is you guys' name?
My name is Reuben.
This is my wife, Lisa.
CLAUDE: I am here all afternoon.
All right, au revoir, Reuben, Lisa.
Solid.
Solid.
CLAUDE: Hi. Hello. How's it going?
(UPBEAT REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING)
Reuben! Lisa!
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Isn't this exciting?
- It is. It's fun.
You know what? I think
I'm gonna skip the scuba diving.
Reuben, no. You called eight hotels.
They all said this guy was the best.
I know, but you know how I am
about boats, and I feel queasy.
Your stomach's acting funny?
It's okay now, but you know
how it gets. So why don't you go?
We're on our honeymoon.
I won't go without you.
No, you've been wanting to try this.
I want you to go, okay?
It will be fun.
I'll pick you up at 4:00, all right?
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
You're not for scuba, Reuben?
No, Claude, I'm gonna go
run some errands in town.
But you guys go. Have fun.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Of course.
Listen, this woman means more to me
than anything else in the world,
so be careful.
Scuba can be very dangerous
if proper precautions aren't taken.
Reuben, look to me in my eyeball.
I promise you I take care of Lisa
as if she were
my own flesh and blood.
- Thank you.
- Okay?
- Solid.
- Okay, solid.
CLAUDE: All right? Are you ready?
Yeah. Will a little boat come over...
Ally oop.
(SHRIEKING)
Au revoir, Reuben.
- REUBEN: Bye-bye, honey! I love you!
- I love you!
(EASY-GOING REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING)
Lisa!
Claude!
Guys?
Hello!
Lisa?
(CLATTERING)
Knock-knock!
Oh, my God.
CLAUDE: I love you!
LISA: Ooh, la la!
Oh, my God!
Holy shit, Reuben!
This is not what it looks like.
You're staying on the island
with Claude?
I'm a little confused
right now, Reuben.
I think I need a little time
to figure things out.
What did you do to her?
Did you mess with her oxygen tanks?
I did nothing, Leuben.
My name's not Leuben! It is Reuben.
Look, we had a scuba, we talk about
life, we drink some white wine.
We cannot help it.
It is like love at first sight.
She make like the fire
in my trouser.
LISA: What he's trying to say, Reuben...
is that we didn't plan it.
It just... It happened.
It's like the story of the hippo.
I'm not familiar with that story.
The hippopotamus is not born going,
"Cool bean, I am a hippo."
No way, José.
So he tried to paint a stripe
on himself to be like the zebra
but he fool no one.
Then he tried to put the spot
on his skin to be like the leopard.
But everyone know he is a hippo.
So, at certain point,
he look himself in the mirror
and he just say,
"Hey, I am a hippopotamus...
"and there is nothing
I can do about it."
And, as soon as he accepts this,
he live life happy.
Happy as a hippo.
You understand?
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Reuben, no!
No, Reuben. This is not the way.
- You're gonna be fine, Reuben.
- No, I'm not gonna be fine.
I'm not gonna be fine at all.
Don't come back to me
when you change your mind,
because this ship has sailed.
(HORN HONKING)
REUBEN: Hey, Tina.
Hey, Mitch.
Hey, Reub.
- Cheryl.
- Hey.
TINA: Indursky & Sons, how may I help you?
What?
How does everyone know about this?
Your mother called Mr. Indursky
and told him what happened.
- I am so sorry, Reuben.
- Thanks, Gladys.
- Come here.
- Okay. Thank you.
- All right.
- I know.
Hey, there he is!
The big man's back.
Come on in here, I want to spitball
something with you.
Can you give me a minute?
I'm just going to the men's room.
I'll join you.
I heard about your honeymoon.
Just terrible.
I knew that girl was a slut
the second I met her.
Well, it's kind of complicated.
I mean, there's...
Don't make excuses.
She's a dime-store hooker and always
will be. Just put it behind you.
Speaking of which, you ever hear
of a guy named Leland Van Lew?
REUBEN: Leland Van Lew...
Yeah, Australian guy, right?
- Made the cover of Forbes last year?
- STAN: Exactly.
(STAN FARTS)
He started one of those high-tech,
modem-scrotum,
God-only-knows-what-they-do
companies anyway. Jesus Christ.
They want to take
the company public
and to remain CEO of the company,
guess what he needs?
- Life insurance.
- Bingo was his name.
- You want me to check him out?
- Yeah. There's just one catch.
This Van Lew has a reputation
as a cowboy.
Apparently, he's one
of these extreme-sports nuts.
So, it's a long shot
but if you can
pull this thing together,
there might be
a lot of dough in it for us,
an extra bonus for you,
help you with those house payments.
All right. Let's make sure
he checks out first, and...
You see? This is why you're the only
one I can trust with these jobs.
I was worried you'd been
through hell and back
with that whore wife of yours.
You sure you don't need
some more time off?
Mmm-hmm.
- I'm good. I'm fine.
- Absolutely sure?
All right, good things.
SECURITY GUARD: Excuse me.
This is private property.
REUBEN: Yeah, I know.
I just bought this house.
I move in next month.
Oh, sure. Mr. Phifer, right?
Feffer. But you can
just call me Reuben.
- Okay. Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thanks.
SECURITY GUARD:
Sorry about your wife, Reuben.
REUBEN ON VIDEO: First ofall, I want
to thank everybody for coming out.
This has been
an incredible day and night.
It's just so great to see all these
people, friends and family.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
To tell you the truth, I've waited
for this day my entire life.
I'm so sorry, Reuben.
Thanks, Sandy.
- SANDY: I'm here for you, brother.
- Thank you.
DUSTIN: We're rolling.
VIC: Sound speed.
- What the hell is this?
- Remember Dustin and Vic?
They're doing the
E! True Hollywood Story on me.
Sorry about your wife.
VIC: Sandy, you want us over here?
SANDY: By the table.
VIC: Are you sure?
SANDY: Yeah.
- Is this better?
- Yeah, thanks.
Look, forget it.
I'm not going to a party?
What do you think will happen?
Lisa'll waltz through that door,
saying she made a mistake?
No, of course not, I'm just...
I'm trying to make sense
out of what the hell she did.
What can I say,
you're my best friend.
You're my partner...
Hold on. Let me see something.
REUBEN ON VIDEO: You're my wife!
Man, it feels good to say that!
And
you're my wife!
Man, it feels good to say that!
Check out her expression.
She's terrified.
- She's smiling.
- I'm a student of acting.
She's faking it.
The woman got spooked.
She needed to explore,
which is exactly what you'll do.
You've been gifted with freedom.
Don't turn your back on it.
I don't want freedom!
I want to be married!
I bought a goddamn house!
I got to move out of this apartment
in, like, six weeks!
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
Look at her.
She's not thinking about having
a deep, committed relationship
with a complex individual
like yourself.
- She's not?
- SANDY: No!
She's daydreaming about having hot,
shallow sex with a French nudist!
"Oh, I'm hugging.
Oh, I love you so much." Liar!
Whose party? Is this again?
It's an art opening
for this Dutch guy, Jost.
His art sucks, but he used
to sell me really good pot.
Oh, man, I'm so frigging horny.
(RHYTHMIC DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
Just don't leave me alone.
I haven't been to a party? By myself
in a long time.
Relax. I'm your wingman.
I'll be by your side the whole time.
So what do we do?
Do we get a drink
or take a lap around the...
Sandy?
- More wine?
- Sure.
Thank you.
This party? 's so boring,
and there are no cute guys.
I haven't noticed.
I'm appreciating the art.
I'm not looking for cute guys.
You swore off men
since dumping your last boyfriend?
He was not my boyfriend.
We went out for three days.
- It was two months!
- Really?
I hope he doesn't have
to buy that now.
Oh, my God! I think I know that guy.
(BELL RINGING)
- You're Reuben Feffer, right?
- Yes?
I'm Polly Prince.
We went to junior high
or middle school
or whatever it's called, together.
- Yeah! Polly Prince!
- Yes.
It's coming back to me now.
You left before high school.
After seventh grade,
my mum and I moved to Michigan.
- Now you live here in New York?
- Moved here a few months ago.
- So, you know.
- REUBEN: Wow.
(GIGGLING)
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah, that's Roxanne.
She does that with bread,
wine bottles, and... Anyway...
So what's your deal?
You've got to be married
with kids and the whole thing.
No, I'm not. I'm single.
I haven't taken the plunge.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Sandy, this is Polly Prince.
Remember? From middle school?
- How you doing?
- Wow.
Okay, Sandy Lyle,
last time I saw you,
you were playing bagpipes
in that movie.
Croco Tears. Yep, that's me.
Polly! Can I have a word with you?
- Sorry.
- Excuse us.
What happened to you?
I'm in a situation here.
We must leave now.
Can we stay a couple more minutes?
Dude, no. This is serious.
I just sharted.
I don't know what that means.
I tried to fart, and a little
shit came out. I sharted.
Now let's go.
You're the most disgusting person
I've ever met in my life.
You have to walk around
and pour wine.
Polly? Focus for one second, okay?
So, hey, I got to go circulate.
So, Sandy, you're good though?
You're still acting?
I am.
Yeah, it's going incredibly well.
I'm actually headlining a new
revival of Jesus Christ Superstar.
POLLY: That's great!
- It was really good seeing you guys.
- You, too.
- See you!
- All right. Bye, Polly.
SANDY: Be good.
POLLY: More wine?
Polly Prince. It's funny, huh?
Seeing her.
POLLY: Are you okay?
GUEST: Great, thank you.
She looks good.
Let it rain!
Let it rain!
REUBEN: I did a lot of thinking
last night...
and there's something
I'm excited about.
SANDY: What's up? Nice. Let it rain!
I feel like I might be ready
to move on,
get my life back on track.
So, I am going to ask
Polly Prince on a date.
That's a mistake!
She's not right for you, dude.
Rain dance!
PLAYER 1: You guys want
to play some twos?
Actually, we're in
the middle of a conversation.
Did you douche bags
bring your "A" game?
What was that?
I'm just messing
with you, Sasquatch.
Let's get it on.
Pick and roll! Take it rough!
Outlet!
Rain dance!
REUBEN: Sandy, come on.
PLAYER 1: I got him.
White Chocolate!
Raindrops!
Old school!
T. Time-out.
I'm burning. My lungs are burning.
Time-out.
So why do you think
Polly's so wrong for me?
(PANTING)
You don't even know this girl.
You haven't seen her
since seventh grade.
How different could she be?
She was a senior delegate
at the Model UN,
she was in the chess club,
a Mathlete.
Her yearbook stats are impressive.
Did you see the tattoo on her back?
Yeah. So what?
Mathletes don't wear body art
like that. Enough said. Ball in!
I really feel like I ran
into Polly for a reason. Really.
I'm sorry if you don't agree.
But I believe
in a little thing called destiny.
PLAYER 1: You guys ready?
You know what? You think maybe
you could put your shirt back on?
PLAYER 1: You guys ready to play?
Good shot.
Could I have the ball for a second?
You know what? Could we switch?
I'd rather not. I just found out
how to cover this man right here.
PLAYER 1: Let's play.

Prince, please? Prince with a "P."
Okay, great.
Can I get the address as well?

POLLY: Hello.
(PHONE RINGS)
REUBEN: Oh, shit!
- REUBEN ON MACHINE: Hi. This is Reuben.
- No!
I'm unable to get to the phone
right now
but please leave a detailed message
after the beep.
If you're calling for Lisa...
(UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
Gladys, I got to call you back.
This is so funny.
I didn't know you lived down here.
Yeah, I do.
Do you live around here, too?
No, I don't. I don't live down here.
Hey. Did you call me last night?
No. I don't think so.
Are you sure?
Because I got a hang-up
so I did that star-69 thingy.
And I swore
I got your answering machine.
Really? I heard that
from a few people,
so maybe the phone lines
got crossed or something.
- You doing some shopping?
- Oh, yeah.
Gosh, I spent like $200
on this loofah.
It's supposed to be specially made
in Sweden or something.
Wow.
Would you like to go
to dinner sometime?
Oh, yeah. Okay.
You know, I'm not sure.
Okay. Really?
Not that I wouldn't. I'd like to.
It would be great
to catch up on stuff and all that.
I just got to check my schedule.
All right, how about
I give you my card?
Here you go.
On the back I've written
my home and my cell number.
- There's also a fax number.
- Right on.
And a pager number, too.
"Reuben Feffer,
Senior Risk Assessment Analysist."
- Right. Analyst.
- Analyst.
POLLY: Right.
All right.
See you.
POLLY: See you.
REUBEN: See you later.
Leland Van Lew's office.
This is Deborah.
Reuben Feffer from Indursky & Sons
calling for Mr. Van Lew.
DEBORAH: Right. The insurance man.
He's in the hospital.
He got bit swimming
with great whites.
- Swimming with who?
- DEBORAH: Great white sharks.
But don't worry.
It was only a flesh wound.
(PHONE RINGING)
DEBORAH: He's due in Los Angeles
next week.
- Should I set something up for then?
- Could you hang on, please?
DEBORAH: No worries.
- POLLY: Hi, Reuben. It's Polly Prince.
- Hey, Polly.
How's it going?
Good. I'm calling to say
I'm free tomorrow night
if you want to get together.
I'd love to get together.
That would be great.
Should I pick a restaurant, or...
No. You know what?
I should probably check my schedule,
see if I can even do it.
Okay. Did you say you were free?
No, I'm actually not sure.
I'll talk to you later. Bye!
Okay, hello?
DIRECTOR: One, two, three, and...
CAST: (SINGING) What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening
What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening
What's the buzz?

Don't you try to think ahead
Save tomorrow for tomorrow
Think about today instead
WONSUK: Sandy?
SANDY: What?
I'm playing Jesus. That's my song.
I know it's your song, but I felt
something and decided to go with it.
But you're playing Judas.
Judas. Look, here's the deal.
I'm the star of the show, okay?
So if I decide to bust out a solo,
give me the freedom to rock out.
From the top, Wonsuk.
- So the play's going well?
- Yeah, I think it's gonna be fun.
I just wish they wouldn't surround
me with a bunch of amateurs.
Isn't that
the point of community theatre?
Whatever.
REUBEN: So I'm going on a date with Polly.
SANDY: All right! Where you taking her?
Some restaurant in the East Village.
She left the address on my machine.
How could you let
Polly pick the restaurant?
I had no choice.
She called me seven times
to confirm
and then cancel
and then confirm again.
Why? What's wrong with letting her
pick the place?
You've got
irritable bowel syndrome, dude.
If she chose an ethnic restaurant,
you'll be running to the bathroom
every five seconds.
Oh, my God. You're right.
Thank you.
I doubt it will get this far
but if she turns out
to be easier than I thought...
there's something you need to know.
- I'm not a virgin, Sandy.
- Not technically
but times have changed
since you were last single.
Now listen...
when I'm making out with a girl
for the first time,
I like to give her
a little spanking.
- What?
- Nothing violent.
Just tap her real light
on the tush and say,
"Hey, I'm your daddy."
Listen to me.
SANDY: What are you doing?
REUBEN: I'm blotting the grease.
That's the best part. Don't be shy.
It's just a little tap.
It's like saying,
"Boop, I'm your daddy."
I'm not gonna tap her.
Brings them right back to childhood.
Trust me, they're putty
in your hands after that.
I'm really excited about this.
I feel like
this could be one of those...
defining moments of my life,
or something, you know?
I actually think it's not gonna
work out, but I'm pulling for you.
Just pray to God
she doesn't go ethnic.
- The place didn't sound ethnic.
- What was the name?
Al Hafez.
(ARABIAN INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
- So, when did you live in Morocco?
- In the late '90s.
I bounced around to a bunch
of places over the past few years.
- Like where?
- Oh, God, where?
Let's see, Austin, Istanbul,
Sri Lanka, Portland,
Costa Rica, Buffalo,
a couple other places.
- Wow. Were you in the Peace Corps?
- No, I just like to move a lot.
I get stir-crazy if I'm stuck
in one place too long, you know?
Yeah, completely.
REUBEN: Remember,
you were the person who...
POLLY: Oh, my God!
I can't believe you remember that.
Of course! You were the greatest
delegate in Model UN history.
POLLY: I guess I did manage
to pass a few resolutions.
Are you okay? Because you're
sweating pretty profusely.
No, I'm fine. I always react
this way to spicy food.
But I love it.
I can't believe you're not married.
Even when we were kids,
I saw you as the guy
who'd settle down at a young age.
You were always kind of
like an old young guy.
Well, it just hasn't happened.
(GASTRIC RUMBLING)
But what about you?
You ever gotten close?
To the whole marriage thing?
Oh, God, no. No way, no. No.
I'm not really big on the whole
long-term commitment thing.
Why, are you coming
out of a bad relationship?
No. I'm coming
out of eight bad relationships.
Eight?
- You sure I can't get you a towel?
- No, I'm good.
But if the right person came along,
things might be different, right?
Yeah. You're probably right.
(GASTRIC RUMBLING)
Sorry.
- You mind if I go to the men's room?
- Please, sure.
POLLY: Oh, gosh!
MAN: Occupied. I'm going to be here
all night, dude.
- All right, well, this is me.
- Great.
Why don't you come upstairs
and I'll make you
some coffee or tea.
REUBEN: Great.
I just got to find my keys here.
Oh, shoot.
(GASTRIC RUMBLING)
POLLY: Right there, I hear them.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Wow! This is great, so cozy.
- Thanks.
- Wow! This is great, so cozy.
- Thanks.
- Did you just move in?
- No, I've been here four months.
Rat! Rat in the house!
Oh, no. This is Rodolfo.
He's a ferret.
I got him in Sicily
at a flea market years ago.
He's old.
He can't really see anymore.
Cute. You mind
if I use your bathroom?
POLLY: Sure.
That's not the bathroom.
My bathroom's right here.
Okay. Yeah, because I just...
had a lot to drink, a lot of water.
I'll just be a second.
Okay, take your time.
(EXHALING)
I don't believe this.
(FARTING)
Go away.
(SHOOING)
(FARTING)
(TURNS ON SHOWER)
(RUNNING WATER)
Oh, no.
(TOILET FLUSHES)
God, I beg you, please,
if you make this water go down,
I'll sit at your feet
and serve you for all of eternity.
I'll adopt a Somalian kid
or I'll work in Calcutta
or I'll just...
Please, make the water go down.
Oh, my God!
POLLY: This was fun.
REUBEN: Yes.
If I'd known your grandmother
embroidered that towel,
- I would've never...
- Really, that's okay.
- Okay, well, good night, Polly.
- Good night, Reuben.
- Good night.
- Okay.
- REUBEN: All right, okay.
- All right, that's nice.
SANDY: Why would you make
number two in her apartment?
She asked me to come upstairs.
What should I have done?
Tell her you're tired
and shag ass out of there.
Guys.
- What was that?
- REUBEN: I called her to apologize.
It doesn't matter, because I doubt
she'll ever want to see me again.
- I got to call you back.
- SANDY: Cool.
REUBEN: Mr. Van Lew?
- Feffer?
- Yes. Hi, Reuben Feffer.
I recognized you
from the Forbes cover.
You're way early, sport.
Come on, then. Get in.
- REUBEN: Is this the service elevator?
- Yeah.
I don't think we'll have a problem
with this insurance business.
Sure, I take chances, but you can't
build a successful business
- without the occasional risk.
- Of course.
What I'm trying to determine are the
kinds of risks you actually take.
Only the calculated ones.
Trust me, I plan on being around
for ages.
I know we'd really love to give you
a policy if we can make it work.
- We'll make it work, sport.
- Great.
- So, what are we doing on the roof?
- I'm doing a bit of a BASE jump.
Here, keep the walkie on channel 13,
all right?
I don't know
what you're talking about.
LELAND: A free-fall
from an inanimate object.
Always carry me chute in case
I find a good launching point.
- Oh, no.
- (PHONE RINGS)
Look, just don't do anything,
all right?
- (ON PHONE) Hey, Reuben, it's Polly Prince.
- Polly, how's it going?
- I'll shout when I'm through, okay?
- No, that's not all right.
Can I call you back?
POLLY: I just wanted to tell you
I got your message.
Let's just start over
and forget about the loofah thing.
Holy shit! No!
(LELAND WHOOPING)
Holy shit!
POLLY: I didn't even like that loofah.
Relax. Leland's meeting
with the insurance guy right now.
LELAND: Whoa! Yeah!
LELAND: Oh, crap!
- Oh, shit!
- POLLY: I'll call you in the next few days.
LELAND ON RADIO:
Leland to Feffer. You there, mate?
Yes, Feffer to Leland, hello?
LELAND ON RADIO:
Come on down and give us a hand.
I think I fractured me coccyx.
(SOOTHING INDIAN MUSIC PLAYING)
(SOOTHING INDIAN MUSIC PLAYING)
POLLY: Look at that.
You got me a new loofah.
It's from Finland
and the salesman said
it has a very ergonomic design.
Oh, Reuben, that's really...
Thank you, that's really sweet.
Oh, my God!
I don't believe this!
What are you doing here?
We're having an early supper.
I wanted your father
to try new cuisines.
It's only 3:00.
It's a crime to beat
the dinner crowds?
- Who is this young woman...
- REUBEN: This is Polly Prince.
Polly, these are my parents,
Irving and Vivian Feffer.
- It's so good meeting you.
- How are you?
I can't believe you're
eating Indian. You hate spicy food.
REUBEN: No, I don't.
Well, I'm going to... Psst!
I'm going to ask...
I'm going to ask
this nice Native American man
to get us a bigger table.
They're Indian.
You can call them Indian. It's okay.
Hi. Need big table, please.
Four people. Many thanks.
Okay.
VIVIAN: Now, how do you kids
know each other?
We went to middle school together.
We were both in the Model UN.
You still work in government, honey?
No. I'm a waitress.
She's also writing
a children's book.
Oh, very nice.
You'll never guess
who I ran into yesterday.
- Who's that?
- VIVIAN: Lisa's mother.
REUBEN: Mmm-hmm. That's good.
Dad, did you try this...
What's this called?
- Saag.
- Saag. Did you try this?
Apparently, Lisa's doing wonderfully
down there in St. Barts...
selling villas, happy.
That's good for her.
- Now, who's Lisa?
- Not important.
Lisa is Reuben's wife.
She left him for another man
on their honeymoon.
Are we ready for the check?
I think we'll take the check.
What?
- Well, your dad seems really nice.
- Yes, a man of few words.
I just want you to know, I was going
to tell you about Lisa. I just...
I was embarrassed and I...
I guess because I hadn't seen you
for so long...
It's so okay. I understand.
I was an idiot. I should've told you
the truth from the start.
Really, I'm not upset.
- But when did this happen?
- Two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago?
Oh, my God! Are you okay?
Well, it was a pretty big shock.
I walked in on her, on Lisa with...
a scuba instructor on the first day
of our honeymoon.
They were still wearing
their flippers. Anyway...
POLLY: I mean...
(ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
Hey, Reuben, it's Polly Prince.
I don't know
if you have any plans tonight
but if not, you should swing by
37 Gansevort Street around 9:00...
if you can make it.
You know, it's no big deal.
But it could be fun,
so, you know, think about it.
Okay, so...
I'll see you later.
Or not. I mean, either way.
Oh, if you do come,
you should wear comfortable shoes.
That is, if you come,
which you totally don't have to.
I mean, I might not even be there.
I am so glad that you came.
I wore comfortable shoes
like you said.
So, what are we doing?
Oh, crap.
(SALSA MUSIC PLAYING)
POLLY: This place is a total secret.
It's the best underground
salsa club in New York.
- I'm not really a big dancer.
- It's easier than it looks.
- There you go. Feel it in your legs.
- REUBEN: All right.
Sorry.
It's okay. Just step on my feet
a little less than that.
FEMALE SINGER: Work it!
- Looking good, Pollyanna.
- Hey, Javi.
Oh, you should stop that.
This is my friend Reuben.
This is Javi.
Mind if I dance
with the beautiful lady?
- I guess not.
- Thanks, man.
(MUSIC SLOWS DOWN)
- I think I might take off.
- Really?
Are you having a bad time?
No, I'm just not into
this whole dirty? Dancing thing.
What do you mean, "dirty? Dancing"?
I saw that movie. I know that's what
you and that Spaniard were doing.
Whoa! Wait a minute.
First of all, he's Cuban.
And that wasn't dirty? Dancing,
that was just salsa.
Okay, I'm just really, truthfully
not the kind of guy
that's ever gonna be
into these kind of clubs...
Okay, Reuben, then...
tell me, what kind of guy are you?
What kind of guy am I?
What do you mean?
Up until now, you haven't exactly
been the portrait of honesty.
So just come clean, okay?
Just tell me who you are.
- I hate spicy food.
- I knew it!
I don't like it at all.
I have a mild case of IBS and...
- What's that?
- Irritable bowel syndrome.
- What?
- Irritable bowel syndrome.
Oh, God. That's terrible. What else?
The thing is,
I assess risk for a living.
So I know I have a 0.013% chance
of being hit by a car
on my way home,
or a 1 in 46,000 chance
- of falling through a subway grate.
- Really?
I manage that risk by
avoiding danger, having a plan
and knowing my next move.
And I guess
you don't live your life that way...
No, I do it a little differently.
Which is great, but I'm not
gonna ever be a dirty? Dancer
and I don't eat food
with my hands
and I really like you
but I just don't think
this is gonna work out.
POLLY: I just have to go pee.
REUBEN: Okay.
(SENSUAL SOUL MUSIC)
(RUNNING WATER)
POLLY: Just kidding!
Oh! Funny.
Hi.
POLLY: Ow!
Did you just spank me?
No! I don't...
Are you sure? Because it felt
like you just swatted me.
No, I have a little crick
in my wrist.
You felt that, I was just...
Do you hear that?
- Really?
- Yeah, you hear that?
Well, I got it out.
(SENSUAL LATINO MUSIC PLAYING)
REUBEN: Oh, wow. This is incredible.
Oh, man.
Oh, God. Oh, yeah.
Oh, no! No, you can't be done yet.
Come on, Reuben, focus.
You have to last
at least five minutes here.
Four minutes, twenty-seven,
twenty-six, twenty-five.
Two minutes, twenty, nineteen,
eighteen, seventeen.
Come on, you can do it.
55, 54, 53, 52, 51, oh, God!
Fifty!
(LAUGHING) Fifty? Yeah!
Whoo!
SANDY: Let it rain!
I think I might end up marrying
this woman.
SANDY: Really? After one night?
Did you spank her?
Yeah, I tried,
but I don't think she liked it.
Yeah, some women find it offensive.
Iceman!
POLLY: I did not sleep with him
out of charity.
You weren't interested
till you found out
his wife boned a guy
on their honeymoon.
That's not it.
He is a kind, decent, solid guy.
I've never been
with anybody like that.
Still sounds like a charity boning.
Do you have to use
the word "bone" every time?
I use it when it's appropriate.
Ever heard of a guy shouting out
"fifty" when he orgasmed?
Okay, so throw pillows
go in this cabinet here.
You don't sleep on these?
No, they're decorative.
- For who?
- What do you mean?
You're the only one who sees them,
but you don't sleep on them.
You take them off the bed,
put them in a box,
take them out, put them...
I just don't understand the point.
I don't know.
Lisa thought they looked nice.
Oh, I see.
I don't see what the big deal is.
They make the bed look nice.
What are you doing?
That's goose down.
I'm liberating you.
- Try it.
- No, I'm not going to...
Just one stab.
Come on, see how you feel.
- This is ridiculous.
- It's not ridiculous.
It's not like driving a knife
into a pillow
is suddenly going
to make me feel...
Wow. That feels really good.
POLLY: Right?
- What did I tell you?
- You're right.
Come on, bigger one!
- REUBEN: What's the point of these things?
- No point.
POLLY: Stupid.
- Am I running a bed-and-breakfast?
- Not anymore.
Know how many minutes I spend
- getting them on and off?
- How many?
Four in the morning, four at night.
Eight minutes.
Fifty-six minutes a week,
two days a year,
spent putting pillows
on and off a stupid bed!
Whoa!
Wait, you hit mattress.
Oh!
You know what? I really got to go.
I'm late. Shoot!
REUBEN: What's wrong?
Lose your keys again?
No, they're just not
where I left them before.
Why don't you use that key-finder
I bought you?
- I don't...
- I think it could help.
...need the stupid key-finder!
All right. Anyway, I was thinking
I'd come meet you.
Really? I thought you hated
dirty? Dancing clubs.
(BEEPING)
It's just salsa. It will be fun.
I'll watch.
- What's that noise?
- Nothing.
- It's the key-finder, isn't it?
- It's so not the key-finder.
- Yes, it is!
- It's not. I'll see you later. Bye.
How?
(LOUD SALSA MUSIC)
(LOUD SALSA MUSIC)
- Reuby Tuesday, ¿cómo estás?
- Doing all right.
You know what? Actually,
me no estás too good, Javier.
I want you to stay away from Polly.
Find yourself another dance partner.
Why?
Because she and I are a couple.
Yeah, we're dating.
And I'm not going to let
some big-shot salsa king
sweep in, with your mambo moves
and your Erik Estrada look
and take her away. That's happened
before, and it won't again...
- Reuben, I am gay.
- I don't care what you... What?
I'm homosexual.
My boyfriend, Hector, plays
the keyboards in the house band.
Oh.
You think maybe you could give me
some salsa lessons?
(UPBEAT SALSA MUSIC PLAYING)
(EXCLAIMS)
- You hated it.
- No, I don't. It's just...
It's very graphic
for a children's book.
You know? Like this one...
- "The boy with a nub for an arm."
- That one has a moral.
To teach kids to be careful when
they're playing with fireworks.
Right, and I think it's brilliant,
by the way, seriously.
I mean, you really convey...
the pain and the fear,
and I love the little doggy, too.
But, and I don't mean this
in a bad way...
Right.
...just what were you thinking?
(UPBEAT SALSA MUSIC PLAYING)
I put all the risks and rewards
into the program,
which helps me finalize my
recommendations...
"Leland Van Lew. BASE jumping."
That's supposed to be so much fun!
That should be on the rewards side.
It's one of the most dangerous
activities a human being can do.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Have you done it?
Have I parachuted
off the top of a building?
No.
So how do you know what it's like?
I don't.
Interesting.
Would you like some more bulgogi?
Sure, thanks. I actually like this.
- POLLY: You do?
- It's good.
(REUBEN VOMITING LOUDLY)
LELAND: Now you look like
a pro racquetballer.
- How's that shirt fit?
- It's fine.
I thought maybe
we could just sit and talk.
I'm not a big racquetball player...
No worries.
We'll have a few giggles.
(BOTH SCREAMING)
I've been running the numbers.
And I got to say, things don't look
good from our end.
LELAND: Bollocks!
REUBEN: Jesus!
Please, Leland, I mean,
it's not just the BASE jumping.
It's the heli-skiing,
volcano-luging, shark-diving.
Bottom line is, unless you
drastically alter your lifestyle,
- we won't be able to insure you.
- Reuben, I came to you for a reason.
I was told you had more imagination
than other blokes in the big firms.
That you analyze the man
and not just the numbers.
I guess I was wrong.
Are you trying to manipulate me?
Of course I am.
But I want to hold on to me company.
I'll tell you what.
I'll be in Nantucket
at the end of the month.
Come up and be my guest
aboard The 'Roo Shooter.
- Aboard the what?
- My sailboat.
I'll take you for a sail,
give you a chance to know me.
By the end of the weekend,
you'll know what a safe bet I am.
You know what?
You're bleeding pretty bad.
I think I've swallowed a tooth.
No. Got it.
Your serve.
REUBEN: So I tell Leland
we can't insure him.
He responds by inviting me
to Nantucket
for some
Death Race Sailing Challenge.
Really? We got to go do that.
I've never been to Nantucket.
- You want to come?
- Is that rude, to invite myself?
Lt'd be great! Good, you'll actually
commit to something in advance.
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
Okay, yeah, I am.
I think that would be really fun.
- What?
- What are you doing?
I'm going to have some nuts.
No. You don't eat mixed nuts
at a bar. Everybody knows that.
What are you talking about?
Okay, let's say, conservatively...
17 people eat these nuts
on a given night. Okay?
If they've been here for two weeks,
we're talking about...
238 people who've dipped their
dirty? Hands into that bowl.
Dirty? Why are their hands dirty??
Only one out of six people
wash hands
when they go to the bathroom.
When you think you're innocently
eating a bar snack,
you're ingesting
potentially deadly bacteria
from 39 soil-handed strangers.
People wonder why
they get E. Coli poisoning
or salmonella or hepatitis.
They should look at the snack bowl
at their local watering hole.
I'm not being neurotic.
It's a hot zone in there.
How could you have eaten those?
I made such a compelling argument.
I like to live life on the edge.
POLLY: Thank you.
REUBEN: Yeah, you never know.
You don't have to do this.
I don't care that you don't know
how to dance!
I thought I'd give it one last try.
Hey, Javi.
Hey, Reuben. You ready?
Uh-huh.
POLLY: What's happening?
- IFuerte!
- POLLY: What?
What are you doing?
(SALSA MUSIC PLAYING)
(EXCLAIMING)
(YIPPING)
I don't know where that came from!
POLLY: It was just awesome.
Holy shit.
What are you doing here?
I'm back.
Who's this?
- Who's this? This is my girlfriend.
- What?
- You have a girlfriend?
- I'm not your girlfriend.
I mean, we're just, kind of...
Hi, I'm Polly.
- Lisa.
- POLLY: Right.
You guys probably have a lot
to talk about, so I'll just go.
- REUBEN: I don't want you to go.
- Please, I want to go. Bye, Lisa.
- Nice to meet you.
- REUBEN: I don't want you to go.
You got to talk about it.
I'm just going to go.
REUBEN: I don't understand.
I thought you were really happy
with Claude.
I was, for a few weeks, but all he
talked about was scuba diving.
- Really?
- I missed you, Reuben.
I missed you, too, but come on!
What was I supposed to do?
I moved on. I'm in a relationship.
- What, with that Polly person?
- Yeah.
She doesn't call herself
your girlfriend.
That's... No, she just doesn't like
the phrasing.
LISA: Okay, then,
let me just ask you this.
Are you really going to spend
the rest of your life with her?
I don't know, Lisa.
Because I'm ready to do that
with you.
I made a mistake,
and I took you for granted.
But I promise you that I will
never, ever hurt you again.
I love you, Reuben.
REUBEN: You know what?
I think you should
go stay with your parents. Okay?
- I've to leave in a week.
- LISA: What? Where are you going?
I'm going into the house
I bought for us. Remember?
Let's do it together.
Let's go move into our house.
We don't just...
No. We can't just go... I can't...
I don't even know
what to say right now, okay? So...
Okay.
POLLY: If you want to get back together
with her...
No, I wouldn't be seeing you
if I was planning...
It's cool. You guys are married.
She came back.
How's it coming
with Herb Lazare, D.D. S?
I haven't even gotten to it.
I'm still working on Van Lew.
I thought you decided on Van Lew
two weeks ago.
We present to AFLAC on Wednesday.
- Can you hang on? Hang on.
- POLLY: I have to go.
- Better not be bonus-hunting on me.
- REUBEN: Bonus-hunting?
That man's career's on the line.
I owe him a thorough analysis.
All right.
I'm going to Barbados with
my mistress for the weekend.
I want this Van Lew thing settled
by the time I get back.
I am on it, and I'll make it happen.
Good things.
(DIAL TONE)
Damn!
- LARRY: Hey, pal.
- Hey, Larry.
Lisa dropped this off for you.
Oh!
Thanks.
(SENTIMENTAL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC
PLAYING)
REUBEN: I met Lisa Kramer, who showed me
an apartment, which I rented...
- just so she'd go out with me.
- LISA: I gave him a good price.
REUBEN: Not good enough. She's a killer.
(SIGHING)
('80S POP SONG)
I just can't believe she came back.
Can we just focus for a second?
I'm almost finished.
- What's next?
- Polly's career prospects.
Risky. She's writing a children's
book where kids get maimed.
Her lack of career is a positive.
She'd have more time for the kids.
SANDY: You're skewing the numbers in
her favor. Why are we doing this?
Because I'm confused.
My goddamn wife
shows up on my doorstep
wanting to get back together.
Polly's freaking out.
I just want to make sure
I'm making the right decision.
SANDY: I don't see how putting these
two girls in the Riskmaster
will help you make up your mind.
REUBEN: Interesting.
SANDY: What's it say?
Polly!
- Polly?
- Yeah.
No way. Just cut your losses
and get back with Lisa.
I checked it three times.
It says she's the safer choice.
Whatever.
By the way, is your health okay?
You're looking thin.
Polly's been making me
eat ethnic food,
so I've been throwing up
a lot lately.
Cool.
Polly Prince.
Polly Feffer.
Polly Prince-Feffer.
You can't cancel.
You were so excited to go.
I know, but...
HOSTESS: We fell in love
with these funny Bolivian mud huts.
- Hold on.
- So we had our designer
use a similar color palette
in here.
Hi. I'm sorry, I'm on the phone.
Would you just please keep it...
(SHUSHING)
Also, I feel weird going away
for the weekend
- when your wife just came back.
- You're making this such a big deal.
REUBEN: I told you, I'm not getting back
together with her.
- So are you coming?
- I'm coming.
- All right.
- Okay?
Bye.
(UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING)
LELAND: You're good. You're a natural.
POLLY: This is amazing!
Hey, Leland, are those storm clouds
up ahead?
No, we might get a light dusting.
Nothing to write home about.
Are you sure you're all right?
REUBEN: I'm okay. I don't think I have
my sea legs yet.
- I'll be out in a sec.
- POLLY: All right.
Oh, God.
(RISKMASTER PROGRAM OPENS)
I know we haven't been seeing each
other long, but I feel like...
it's time we take things
to the next level
and I'd like you
to consider moving in with me.
Why don't we just move in together?
Oh, yeah, we're going to have
ourselves a tussle.
(RODOLFO SQUEAKS)
Rodolfo's in your toiletry kit.
Did you know that?
Did you pack him, or did you...
What is this?
Why am I in your computer
on your Riskmaster thingy?
Okay, you know what?
I can explain this.
It's fascinating, actually.
I learned a lot about myself.
I've learned that I have no career,
I'm flaky, I like ethnic food.
Would you let me explain?
Lisa came back, and I've been trying
to figure things out.
- What are you figuring out?
- Just about us, and our future.
Future? What are you talking about?
What future?
Reuben, come on.
This is a fling, you know?
What, did you think
we'd get married?
REUBEN: Whoa! Maybe.
I was gonna ask you
to move in with me first.
You expect me to move to the
suburbs with you? Are you insane?
Why is that so crazy?
People do that all the time.
They have kids, they make plans,
they get married, they buy houses.
That's you, Reuben. You do that.
That's what you do.
I don't live my life that way.
Is your lack of a plan
that different than my plan?
- I don't have a plan.
- You're on the non-plan plan.
- I am not on a non-plan plan.
- You are, too.
I've never met anybody
more afraid of commitment.
You were a senior delegate
at the Model UN, Polly.
What the hell happened to you?
(LELAND WHOOPING)
Come on, you mother!
You can do better than that!
I've been living my life, okay?
I've been in good relationships
and in shitty ones.
And I've moved a lot
and I've been happy and sad
and lonely and that's what
I've been doing.
Which is more than I can say
for some freak
who thinks he'll get Ebola virus
from a bowl of mixed nuts.
Those nuts have pee on them!
It's common sense.
Trust me, that is so far
beyond common sense.
REUBEN: You don't understand
what I grew up with.
My mother made me
afraid of everything.
Big deal, Reuben.
My dad had a whole second family.
- What?
- Yeah, on Long Island.
A wife and kids
and a golden retriever.
A second family?
Whatever. Hey, you know what?
I'm glad I saw that. I am.
Because I'm going to make this
really easy for you, Reuben.
I have no interest...
in getting married
and moving to the suburbs.
And obviously that's
really important to you.
So here's what I think
your new plan should be.
You should get back together
with Lisa, move into your house
and move on with your life.
And I think you guys
will be really happy together.
Oh, dear Lord.
(CRASHING)
REUBEN: You're not making my job
any easier, Leland.
Come on, Reub.

or call back, or not.
You know, whatever. Okay, bye.
Hey, Polly, it's me. Listen...
I'd like to talk to you, because I
feel bad about what happened.
Give me a call on my cell phone.
(REUBEN SIGHING)
(PHONE RINGS)
- Hello?
- LISA: Hi. It's Lisa.
LISA: So, how's the house?
The house is great.
It's big, but, you know, great.
I can't wait to see it.
Did you get the gift I sent you?
Yeah, I did. Thanks.
I really want to see you.
I don't know, Lisa.
Let me think about it.
M. C: Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.
The premiere ofJesus Christ
Superstar is about to begin.
Hey, Reuby Tuesday!
- ¿Cómo estás?
- What are you doing here?
What else? Hector's playing
keyboards in the band.
I didn't figure you a fan
of musical theatre.
My friend Sandy Lyle is in the show.
Have you talked to Polly?
She was upset, bro.
It must've been some kind of fight.
Yeah, I keep calling her
and she won't pick up the phone.
I don't know, I was thinking about
maybe dropping by tomorrow.
It's a bit too late, papi.
She's leaving town in two hours.
What?
Why? Where is she going?
I don't know. She said goodbye.
That's it.
- Hi, I'm sorry I'm late.
- No, yeah. Hi.
Hey, Javi, this is Lisa, my wife.
Her mother told me she was back.
You're doing the right thing here.
- Relax. I'm not promising anything.
- It's very exciting.

STAN: Reuben, Stan. Change of plan.
The meeting with Van Lew's board
and AFLAC has moved to 4:00.
4:00? I don't know if I can do that.
STAN: What's wrong with you?
Get your ass over here!
SANDY: Good evening, folks.
I'm Sandy Lyle
and I've got
a very special announcement.
Please note
that in tonight's performance,
in addition to playing Judas,
I'll be playing Jesus as well.
Thank you and enjoy the show.
DIRECTOR: Sandy, what are you doing?
Wonsuk is playing Jesus.
SANDY: It's cool. I'll play dual roles.
Give me the crown, Wonsuk.
WONSUK: Screwyou, Sandy,
you're a has-been.
No one even cares
you were in that stupid movie.
- Oh, no.
- WONSUK: Oh, shit!
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
WONSUK: Judas is biting me!
What happened in there?
I'm a professional and I won't put
my reputation on the line
for a group of freaking amateurs.
IRVING: It's always the same story
with you, pal.
You did this one movie
a hundred years ago.
From then on, you thought you were
better than everybody else.
Why don't you let go,
move on with your life?
It's not about
what happened in the past
or what you think
might happen in the future.
It's about the ride,
for Christ's sake.
There's no point in going through
all this crap
if you don't enjoy the ride.
And you know what?
When you least expect it,
something great might come along.
Something better than
you even planned for.
You were funny as hell
playing those bagpipes, though.
Did I ever tell you that?
I don't think I've ever heard you
speak before, Mr. Feffer.
So, Reuby, are we going to grab
a bite after your work thingamajigy?
No, Lisa...
I shouldn't have asked you
to come down here.
I'm not getting back together
with you.
What are you talking about?
- Why?
- REUBEN: "Why?"
You screwed a scuba-diving
instructor on our honeymoon.
What kind of cold, heartless bitch
would do that to someone they love?
I'd have to be an idiot to get back
together with you after that.
And by the way, I destroyed
all your little throw pillows.
Yeah, because throw pillows suck.
They serve no purpose.
They're purely decorative.
SANDY: Dude, that was incredible!
You told me I should get back
together with her.
Whatever you do, don't ever take
my advice again.
Your dad totally put it
in perspective for me.
I was barely famous back then,
and I'll never be famous again.
What about your
E! True Hollywood Story?
The E! Channel doesn't even know
we're making this show.
What do you mean?
I hired Dustin and Vic myself.
I was going to try and sell it
to the network when I'm done.
You're doing an
E! True Hollywood Story on yourself?
Sandy, that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.
I know. I'm such a loser.
I need you to do something for me
that's really important
so promise me, this one time
you won't screw it up.
Reuben, I'm your wingman.
Whatever it is,
I will not let you down.
You're Reuben's proxy?
What the hell does that mean?
He's dealing with
a personal situation,
so he asked me to fill in.
Relax, I'm a professional actor.
They will never know the difference.
- I can't freaking believe this.
- Quiet. I'm trying to prepare.
I'm going to vomit.
I am so sorry
for the delay, folks...
but one of our senior analysts,
Reuben Feffer,
had his spleen burst
just a few moments ago and...
- That's not good. Will he be okay?
- STAN: God willing.
Be that as it may, we have
Mr. Feffer's associate here...
Mr. Sanford Lyle,
who's been briefed on the case
and will present
Reuben's recommendations.
Thank you, Stanley.
(CLEARS THROAT NOISILY)
I just need a little water.
As you know, this is a highly
complex case.
Let me see here.
On the plus side, Leland's
blood pressure is pretty solid.
And he's at a decent weight.
And he looks
pretty damn healthy, right?
I mean, he's a sexy guy.
Right?
And he is sexually active
in the community.
(HONKING)
Polly!
JFK, please.
(RODOLFO SQUEAKS)
(RODOLFO SQUEALS)
Let's not bullcrap each other.
On paper, Van Lew is one of
the riskiest sons of bitches alive.
But, people,
we cannot sum up a man's life
with a bunch of numbers
on a computer screen.
We all need to look
into our hearts and go,
"Do I think this dude is going
to die in a few years or not?"
Is Leland here going to fight off
a man with the last name Reaper...
first name...
Who goes by the last name Reaper...
first name Grim?
Or will this BASE-jumping...
crocodile-wrestling...
shark-diving...
volcano-luging...
bear-fighting, snake-wrangling...
motocross-racing bastard die?
And the answer...
is no, friends.
Which is why myself...
Reuben Feffer, Stan...
and all of us here
at Indurby & Friends,
are willing to lay our asses
on the line
and proudly recommend
that Leland Van Lew
receive $50 million,
in life and health
and automobile insurance,
for a duration
of no less than 20 years.
What do you think, guys?
Are you that kid
from Crocodile Tears?
- You're goddamn right I am.
- I thought so.
Impressive presentation.
He's insured.
- Congratulations.
- Bloody ripper!
Love you, son!
(BEEPING)
POLLY: Rodolfo, wait!
I'm so sorry!
Reuben, it's too late. I have to be
on a plane in 45 minutes.
I don't think
you really want to leave here.
You have no idea what I want.
You left Rodolfo behind.
Does that mean anything?
(SQUEAKS)
I made a mistake. I should've
never put you in the Riskmaster.
Truth is, no matter what happened
on our honeymoon,
- you're much riskier than Lisa.
- Yes! Right!
That's why it won't work out
between us.
Reuben, you're a nice,
safe, conventional guy.
It's not going to work out.
I don't think
that's who I really am.
It is. That's okay.
What do I have to do
to prove it to you?
POLLY: What are you... Oh, my God.
Hey, look! Look, I'm eating nuts.
- What are you doing?
- Those nuts aren't even dirty?
(GROANS)
Since we've been together,
I've felt more uncomfortable,
out of place, embarrassed
and just physically sick
than in my entire life.
But I couldn't have
gone through all that...
I couldn't have thrown up
19 times in 48 days...
if I wasn't in love with you.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is just a fling.
But if you get on that plane
and go to Cincinnati or Tanzania
or wherever, we'll never know
if it could've been more.
POLLY: Oh, no.
Please don't eat those.
POLLY: No, really.
I don't want you to go away.
- I'm not going to marry you.
- I don't want to get married.
I just want to take you to dinner.
Sometime this week.
Can I pick the place?
(UPBEAT CALYPSO MUSIC PLAYING)
CLAUDE: Solid!
Excuse me. Hi. Hello.
I see you two are new to the island.
I want to come have a meet...
Oh, my stars and stripe, Reuben!
Oh, my God,
I cannot believe it is you.
- This is Polly.
- Hi, Polly. I am Claude.
Wow, hi.
So, how's it going?
In truth, it has been a little bit
tough noogies for me.
Lisa, she broke my heart.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- That is life.
Well, you have to be like the hippo.
Exactly. Like the hippo.
So, let me guess.
You are here on honeymoon again?
- This is your beautiful bride?
- No, we're just hanging out.
- It's more serious than that.
- I'm just saying we're not married.
Right. Definitely not married.
But it's possible.
It is possible.
We're taking things step by step,
seeing how they work out.
I don't really understand
what you're talking about...
but any chance
you're for scuba today?
You know what,
actually we are for scuba.
- No way, José!
- Yes way, José!
But, we're going out with that guy.
REUBEN: We'll be out there in a minute!
You know what? As long as
you're for scuba, I am happy.
Oh, that's sweet.
So, au revoir, my good friend.
Thank you for everything, Claude.
It's good to see you again.
Good-bye, Polly.
POLLY: Nice to meet you, Claude.
CLAUDE: You, as well.
- So you're ready?
- Let's do it!
