                    Terry...
     Denise, why aren't you
     in science?
                 They're showing
                 a film strip.
          Everyone left.
          I have to talk to you.
    Denise, I'm really into
    this article.
              I know, but I need
              your advice,
                 and you are
                 my best friend.
         and I tried to deal
         with this myself, okay,
                  and I'm really
                  stressed out!
         Three guys want to take
         me out Saturday night,
        and I'm not too thrilled
        about any of them,
            but I think I should
            go out with someone
        in case I don't
        have a real boyfriend
                    by the prom.
    Okay, who are the guys?
            If I give you names,
            you cannot laugh.
                         I know.
            You have the perfect
            college boyfriend.
You think Kevin's perfect?
            He's a god, okay?
                Can we talk
                about me now?
                    Where was I?
                 Bruce Schulman,
                 Edward Zink,
              and Roger Gibbler.
        This is serious.
                         I know.
        All right.
  On a scale of lame to cute,
who rates
the least low?
            They're all lame.
                Put Roger
                in a Rent-A-Tux,
                he might move up
                to semi-lame.
Okay, forget looks.
Who's got
the hottest car?
                  A Pinto,
                  dad's Skylark,
                  and a Schwinn.
Looks like you're going to have
to skip the prom.
     Hey, hey, everybody...
                 Listen up. Hey.
        A lot of you have been
        giving me a lot of grief
    about this <i>Sun-Tribune</i>
    <i>journalism competition.</i>
 Well, I finally got
 all of your submissions ready.
                Now, during my
                planning period,
                I picked
                the best two,
            and then from those,
    and from those submitted
    by all of your pals
over at Sturgis-Wilder...
      [BOOING AND HISSING]
        Thank you.
...the <i>Trib</i> will pick one,
and award somebody
a summer internship, okay?
          So I'll post the names
          of the winners
                     in the main
                     trophy case
              right after
              I finish my lunch.
Tuna salad on whole wheat.
A summer job at the <i>Sun-Tribune.</i>
<i>Think about it.</i>
     I'll think about that.
 You think about me at the prom
 with a lizard.
I think
you're exaggerating.
          Hi, Denise.
        A-are you busy
        Saturday night?
                        Sorry.
    Mr. Raymaker, Mr. Vino,
    the driver's ed teacher,
      just ran over a dog.
  Should I take a photographer
  over?
                        No.
    What's up, Terry?
How's it
going, Terry?
                     - Hi, guys.
                     - Hi, guys.
Bye... guys.
Am I invisible?
                     They were
                     in a hurry.
        You are so hot.
Buddy...
I just ate.
  Thanks for stopping by, Bud.
Any time, sis.
            Our parents are gone
            for two weeks.
                You know what
                that means?
             Their king-size bed
             is empty.
              What do you think?
I think if you and I
were the last man
and woman on earth,
the human race
would die out.
You want time
to think it over.
                I understand.
                I have two words
                for you.
                  Slumber party.
              We'll invite every
              girl you know.
                    Tall, short,
                    loose, easy.
                  I'll be
                  the bartender.
                    They can use
                    my bedroom,
        they can use my body.
                 I want to help.
 You want to molest my friends.
        Forget it.
              Why?
      You'll have a party,
      and I'll...
          Uh, uh, uh!
            Oh, God.
      Does he do this
      at the dinner table?
             Don't get me wrong.
        It's not like I've
        never had sex before.
I've had lots
of sex.
              It's just that now
              I'd like to try it
                 with a partner.
We really have to get back
to school.
Yes, we must
get back.
I want to make sure my article's
             in the trophy case.
Yes, we really
must get going.
         You have
         to get going?
    I'm 15 years old.
         In two years,
I reach the peak
of my sexual powers.
The clock is ticking.
I have to get jamming.
             Can't you hear
             what you're saying?
             Aren't you a little
             embarrassed?
Nope. I'm horny.
Horny will kick
embarrassment's ass
every time.
                Budster,
                listen to me.
 Don't you want your first time
 to be with someone you love?
I guarantee it,
I'll be in love.
        There's Lisa MacAdoo.
I'll hear she'll do
anything with anybody.
                She looks pretty
                cheap to me.
Me too.
                    Denise, I am
                    so excited.
            You know this job
            means,
                everything in
                life to me.
I know. Just make sure you work
in the Sports section
That way we can interview
all the cute jocks.
             You are going to be
             so proud of me.
          I am going to make
          such a great reporter.
I'm not there.
                      Why aren't
                      you there?
              Neal Perlow
              and Joseph Dreyer?
And then I had
Terry Griffith,
fourth period civics.
Did you see
what she's wearing?
The legs
do not stop.
I say
we flunk her.
Keep her here
for another year.
You better
be careful, George.
You could lose
your job.
                    Be worth it.
                It's not that
                great a job.
            Terry...
 What's wrong with my article?
Well, there isn't anything
wrong with it, per se.
It's just not outstanding work.
      Well, I think it is.
 What do you give me
 straight A's for, my wardrobe?
I give you the A's
because of your hard work,
      and you write well,
    but this contest,
  it's a completely different
  ball game.
  When I read those articles,
  I have to ask myself,
"Does this person
have a nose for the news?"
"Do they dig out
the most interesting
angle on a story?"
 Oh, so I see,
 what you're trying to tell me
is that the nutritional content
of our school lunches
    isn't interesting.
Now, Terry, I know
that you're disappointed,
     but I had to pick kids
     who've got a real shot
at becoming journalists.
  I am going to be a reporter.
I like
that attitude,
     but don't you think
     that it would be nice
    to have something
    to fall back on?
        Like what?
Uh, well, you're a pretty girl,
you could be a model.
          Be a model?
  Why? Because a pretty girl
  can't possibly have a brain?
    Look, what I meant was--
                     I know what
                     you meant!
    This is a great article,
      and it belongs
      at the <i>Sun-Tribune,</i>
    and you are so clueless
    to, like...
     It is really pathetic.
        [DOORBELL RINGS]
Terry, it's Mr. Wonderful.
     [DOORBELL RINGS]
     Always when I'm busy.
     [DOORBELL RINGS]
              She's in the pool.
- What took you so long?
- I knew it was you.
I keep forgetting
how young you are.
 What a waste of a sports car.
Listen, everything's
going to be all right
    How'd this get in here?
Why do you always tie
these double knots?
Kevin, please
forget the knot.
What I need
is a little sympathy.
      I had my heart set
      on that summer job.
Oh, Terry.
I know exactly
how you feel.
 Can I tell you a little story?
            When I was a kid,
        I was obsessed
        with being a fireman.
              I set little fires
              in the backyard,
            and I practiced
            putting them out.
            Then one day,
            when... I was 12,
             I learned I could
             never be a fireman.
Why, what happened?
            I found out how much
            money they make.
                    Pitiful.
Don't you understand
that I don't care
what reporters make?
  I can't remember a time
  when the was anything else
              I wanted to do,
                 and it's pretty
                 discouraging
          when Raymaker tells me
                 that I should
                 become a model.
Why not?
You're a knockout.
Besides, models make
some pretty nice bucks.
      You don't think
      I can do it, either.
  Well, no, that's not exactly
  what I said...
Exactly.
Yeah, well, itas close enough.
You know,
it's lucky for you
I'm in love with you,
I think,
or I'd probably never
speak to you again.
I'd like to be
alone, please.
Now?
  Can't you be alone when your
  parents are home?
Since you haven't listened
to one word I've said,
    why don't you try
    reading my lips.
        Goodbye, Kevin.
Would you rather spend the night
at the frat house?
             [♪]
All men care about is sex.
         I resent that.
Big improvement, huh?
The room
needed something.
                Your room is why
              my life is totally
              screwed up.
 You guys think beautiful women
 are nothing but decoration,
total airheads.
                    Hey, not me.
             These women have
             my deepest respect.
For showing
their boobs?
            And for their minds.
              It just so happens
                  that Kim here
                  reads Vonnegut
             in her bubble bath,
        and Louann has
        dedicated her centerfold
                to help clean up
                toxic waste,
             and the only reason
        Barbara does her physics
        homework buck-naked
                  is 'cause that
                  library's hot.
Come on, Buddy
admit it.
You would love to
spend your entire life
just using
women's bodies.
            Yeah, all but
            the last 60 seconds.
     I'd like a little time
     to reminisce.
Can't you think of anything
more profound than getting laid?
        A blowjob?
                      I'm sorry.
This is the perfect end
to my day.
I mean, it's as if
women's lib never existed.
Today's woman has the freedom
to be just as sick and perverted
          as us guys.
     Oh, that's wonderful.
     I mean, I write
     an excellent article,
 and just because I'm... cute,
 no one takes me seriously.
It's not fair.
  And yet somehow you find
  the courage to go on living.
         You got guts.
     Sometimes I just wish
     I were a guy.
         No, you don't.
             The male body needs
             sex at all times.
             It's a living hell.
I bet if a guy turned in
the same exact article,
it would be at
the <i>Sun-Tribune</i> right now.
Yeah, no kidding.
Hey, does Miss April
look straight?
        [DOORBELL RINGS]
What are the odds of this being
a homeless nymphomaniac?
      Is your sister home?
Yeah.
Hey, Terry,
you got company.
             Terry?
Why am I
brain-damaged?
I just fooled
my own brother.
            Hey, I wasn't
            paying attention.
                    Now I am.
                Hello, Terry.
I think I can
pull this off.
                    This morning
                    I knew her.
                I talked to her.
             She screamed at me.
     Everything was great.
 Now she's wearing my clothes.
 Hey, who do you think you are,
  <i>Tootsie?</i>
              No.
Okay, <i>Yentl?</i>
What do you
want to be, a rabbi?
      Just tell me what's wrong.
                     Really?
            Okay. Well, uh...
                 Look how you're
                 standing.
                    I mean, drop
                    your hands.
                 Okay, now stick
                 your hip in.
             All right, now move
             your feet apart.
                  Hey... Guys
                  take up space.
          All right, now, you've
          got to look tougher.
Very crucial.
Something
every guy does.
Let me see you
scratch your balls.
                Come on, try it.
                  Wait a minute.
            Watch the master.
             Now, first, there's
             your basic shift...
                  But that's not
                  always enough.
              Sometimes, you've
              got to get inside,
                dig a little,
                let some air in,
             move things around.
Yeah, well,
maybe my balls don't itch.
  All balls itch. It's a fact.
  Well, maybe this would help.
                      Not bad.
Shit. Maybe I
should try that.
Okay.
Let's see you walk.
                    Hold it.
Look, you got
balls now.
Use them.
  Say, baby, what's happening?
 I'm a lean, mean, sex machine,
 and that be the way it is.
Say, baby,
what's happening?
I'm a lean, mean,
sex machine.
                  and that be
                  the way it is.
I think you'll pass
as long as you don't move.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to take
that article
    to Sturgis-Wilder,
and I'm going to submit it
as a guy.
    It makes perfect sense.
    You got a problem,
    you get in drag.
  You don't think I can do it,
  do you?
        No way...
                 But d love
                 to see you try.
Hey, how you doing?
     We'll talk more later.
                Once you're into
                power blitzing,
             doing super sets is
             like jerking off.
     The key is to work out
     every possible minute.
             Like, say you don't
             have any weights?
            You use freshmen.
                  I'm serious.
        Excuse me! This'll
        just take a minute.
                    Okay, get
                    a good grip,
                 bend your knees
                 and lift.
     One, two. One, two...
                     [GRUNTING]
         Hey, no pain,
         no gain.
    This is great
    for the deltoids.
          Thanks, kid.
                  Happy to help.
        Who invited you?
      Uh... I'm new here.
    Just what we need,
    another pussy.
        Strong as an ox,
      and almost as smart.
- Ooh...
- Ooh...
Another good exercise
for upper body strength...
 The pussy toss, for distance.
             Hey, get off me!
     Get off me right now!
    Ow! Watch the prickers.
             Damn!
Great bunch of guys.
                I see you met
                Greg Tolan.
                He kind of
                runs the school.
            I'm Rick Morehouse.
                Try not to
                get us confused.
Willy, give us a synopsis
of <i>Catcher In The Rye.</i>
[MAKING ALIEN NOISES]
           <i>Catcher In The Rye...</i>
         A novel written by
         the earthling Salinger
that every adolescent
 <i>Homo sapiens</i> in America
is forced to read.
      You didn't read it,
      did you?
                  Our mission
                  on your planet
            is to study human
            behavioral patterns.
Last night, we simulated
a daily teenage ritual,
homework avoidance.
We consumed
large quantities
of fermented hops,
and were transformed
into degenerate
party animal headbangers.
[SILLY ALIEN LAUGHTER]
    Can I go
    to the restroom please?
         Three minutes.
    I don't care what galaxy
    you two are from.
      You've been pulling
      this routine
                for three years.
                  You'll be here
                  another year
                  if you don't
                  straighten up.
I want that homework now.
The earth woman seems
so tense, irritable.
Too much coffee.
                 Not enough sex.

        Table pressing.
    Good for strength
    and definition.
    Full extension
    is very important.
    No pain, no gain.
                         Gotcha!
Uh, Coach Morrison?
        One moment, son.
Bowling, uh... Great game.
The greatest,
but it's more than a game.
  It's the ultimate challenge.
  One man, one ball, 10 pins.
        10 frames too.
                        Exactly!
    Uh, you see, coach, um,
    I just transferred here
    from another school,
      so I don't have
      my gym clothes yet,
    so I guess I'll just go
    to Study Hall.
                        Hold it.
    Everyone dresses
    for my gym class.
                    Everyone.
             Great.
I have surprise jock inspections

I really
hate gym.
  I don't like
  the smell in here.
        Excuse me.
             Oh, it's spreading.

of my way!
We have a saboteur
in our gym class.
A real scum!
        A nimrod!
  Whoever started that fire...
  Is a human gutterball.
            A zero!

I couldn't
help it, coach.
If I left him
in the locker,

          You get rid of it,
          or I'll get rid of it.
Shh.
        It's all right.
        It's okay.
He's just a little upset.
Don't worry about it.

        I can't send it.
 Your writing skills are fine,
      but, man, this stuff
      is really boring.
You've got to
grab the reader.

a little.
    Right. Goose them.
Just because you're a guy
  doesn't mean you can't write
  with sensitivity,
with feeling,
with heart,
    but you do show promise.
     Look, I'm not going
     to choose the winners

Yeah, well, uh... Thanks.
          DENISE: Terry, I hate
          when you're depressed.
          I mean, if you're this
          upset over your life,
                    I should
                    be suicidal.
            I mean, look what
            Kevin sent you.
                 I'd do anything
                 to come home
                 and find roses.
     Can we define the word
     "anything"?
Maybe Raymaker
was right
about my article,
but I know
I can do better.
I'm just confused.
  Of course, you're confused.
  You're wearing my underwear.
             Terry, forget it.
             Come back to Pearl.
                  So you got
                  a bad haircut.
                I mean, you've
                got a great life
                  and a fabulous
                  boyfriend.
        I can't give up.
And today was a disaster,
and I was a major geek,
      but they all thought
      I was a guy.
              I was in the boys'
              locker room!
        You were?
              Yes.
And they were?
Yes.
                Can I be your
                younger brother?
     There's a story here.
    I don't know what it is,
    but I've got
    until a week from Monday
                     to find it.
Hey, what about
"Girl Gets in Locker Room,
Turns Stupid."
                I can still
                win that job.
        I'm going to go
        to Sturgis-Wilder,
          and I'm going to start
          making friends...
    Any friends I can find.
    What if Kevin finds out
you were in
the boys' locker room?
                    Denise...
 Would Woodward and Bernstein
 worry about their girlfriends?
              No.
Anyway,
Kevin will never find out.
              Unless I tell him,
    which I would never do...
As long as Denise
cooperates.
Denise?
                  When pigs fly.
Never hurts to ask.
It's driving
me crazy.
I looked
everywhere.
I can't find the back
of my earring.
What am I
supposed to do,
walk around all day
with one earring?
That is so punk.
                Listen, all
                you've got to do
             is break the eraser
             off a pencil.
        and you can use it
        to hold your earring on.
                Should get you
                through the day.
Oh, thanks.
                 I have sisters.
                  We're in
                  the cafeteria.
      Everything eats
      and is eaten by something.
                Don't take it
                personally.
            Remember when I--
Hi. Uh, I'm Terry Griffith.
 Oh, hi.
 I'm Harold "Reptile" Sherpico.
It's time to feed Snowball
his lunch.
    Oh, Snowball. He's cute.
                  Oh, that's not
                  Snowball.
    This is Snowball.
         That's lunch.
                 They don't make
                 Snake Chow.
 It was very nice meeting you.
                    Nice meeting
                    you too.
    Want some company?
                    Want some
                    company?
    Want some company?
Uh, yeah, sure.
      I'm Terry Griffith.
             Oh, I'm sorry.
             I forgot your name.
        Rick Morehouse.
      Oh, yeah. That's it.
     Last time we met,
     I was in some bushes.
    Right. Big fun
    being the new kid, huh?
                    Are you new?
        Two months ago.
  Actually, I'm a professional
  new kid.
Seven schools
in three years.
I really know
how to register.
                      Excuse me!
                     Hi! Thanks.
                It worked great.
                 He knew how to
                 fix my earring.
That's because
he's a little tulip.
You know
Deborah Strowbridge?
                     Not really.
But, I mean,
she talked to you.
Deborah Strowbridge
is perfection.
  Well, seems to me
  like she's got a boyfriend.
Yeah, well, there's
no accounting for taste.
      So are you a senior?
Yeah.
     You going to college?
      Well, I like music,
  and d like to do something  i,
 but I'm not too sure you have
 to go to school to do it.
    I dig music a lot too.
     I like, um, The Clash,
     The Talking Heads,
and Springsteen and Prince.
Oh yeah?
That's pretty cool.
        Listen to this.
            Look. What a fox.
Dresses like
Elvis Costello,
looks like
the Karate Kid.
        I'm going to get him.
  Severe intestinal disorder?
              What's the matter?
             You having a little
             tummy ache?
          What are you, a pussy?
Uh... My doctor said
that I should be okay
by a week from Monday.
So I guess I'll just
go to Study Hall--
                  No, you won't.
            I have a little
            job for you, son.
          Here you go.
    Hey, knock yourself out.
    Hey, you look
    like you could use two.
Dragon coming through.
Watch your toes.
     Come on, Fifi.
     Don't dawdle. Come on.
What are you
looking at?
                    Nothing.
Tulip.
        Nice to see you.
Hi. I'm Sandy.
                     Terry.
Yeah, I know.
That's an incredible tie.
Where'd you get it?
                     At a store.
            Bitchen.
So I guess
if you're new here,
you don't have
a girlfriend.
     Yeah, well, I got one
                      back home.
  Long-distance relationship?
Good luck.
        Yo, Rick!
     You want a ride home?
                     Uh... Sure.
Yeah, well, got to go, Sandy,
so I guess I'll see you around.
        Yeah, you will.
She's pretty nice.
Yeah, but I got this one rule--
I never go out with girls
who say "bitchen."
      Pull up right here.
      This is fine.
Thanks for the ride.
            Well, uh... What are
            you doing now?
I don't know. Nothing.
Did you want to come in?
                Well, I was
                just going to--
 I was going to tune up my car,
 maybe play a little football,
     but, yeah, I got time.
Okay.
      Um, if my mom comes
      home from work,
     and she asks you
     about my girlfriend...
    Just so you know,
    her name is Alice,
and she looks a lot
like Chris Evert Lloyd.
I just don't want her to worry,
you know, about my social life.
  Yeah, but Chris Evert Lloyd?
          It was Wimbledon Week.
             Do you want a beer?
Yeah, I'll take a brewski.
So you don't really
have a girlfriend.
                 You guessed it.
What about
the prom?
                  What about it?
      Well, yoknow,
      it sounds all right,
      Passion in Paradise,
      you're renting out
      that big surf place.
Don't you
want to go?
     Yeah, but it's kind of
     a romantic night.
                 I'd rather not
                 go with my mom.
Well, did you ask anyone?
 Well, you'd better get going!
            Come on,
who's your
first choice?
                You ask a lot
                of questions.
Rick, we're rapping
man to man about chicks
      and shit like that.
             You know, like, uh,
             still a virgin?
I don't know.
                 You don't know?
            Weren't you
            paying attention?
    Are you a virgin?
              No.
Have you slept with
a lot of girls?
                         No.
              Have you ever
              slept with a girl?
    Yeah.
        Well, all right,
        let's hear the story.
It's no big deal.
Um, just after
my dad died,
this friend of my mom's...
I think she wanted
to cheer me up.
She did.
            Hey, is that your
            room over there?
    Wait a minute,
    don't go in there.
      It's kind of messy.
This is different.
 I'm kind of into James Brown.
          I guess so.
                You know Prince,
                Michael Jackson?
                It all goes back
                to James Brown,
          the godfather of soul.
Not to mention,
Mr. Humanitarian, Mr. Dynamite,
and the hardest working man
  in show business.
        Ah, New York City, live,
        Apollo Theater, 1962.
    This man was king.
 Well, let's hear some sounds.
    I don't think so.
Stereo broken?
No, it's just
something I do by myself.
              Huh?
                    Well, when I
                    hear James,
    I have to dance...
You know, like James.
Go crazy. I can't help it.
             And I'm usually
             alone when I do it.
That's cool, man.
I can respect that.
How about another
brewski, okay?
                    Okay.
Budster...
The refrigerator
gives new meaning
to the word "empty."
        Hey, don't worry
        about breakfast.
            This stuff tastes
            great cold.
You agreed to do
half the shopping
around here
while Mom and Dad
were gone.
             Yeah, that's right,
             the second half.
        Now, I'll tell you what.
        I'll do the dishes.
        Thank you.
    I can see myself.
      [TELEPHONE RINGING]
  I'll get it.
             Hello.
    Hey, yo, scumbag.
Hey, suck your own.
            Eat me.
  Hey, same to you, buttface.
          Mom says hi.
  Yo, Rick. How they hanging?
          It's Terry.
  Listen, I want you
  to wear something really hip
      to school tomorrow.
 We're going to get you a date
 for the prom.
      Just do what I say.
             Okay.
             Yeah.
    Bye-bye... Uh, scumbag.
    Shit. He hung up.
        [GROWLING]
This is your idea
of hip?
A guy who
is into James Brown?
         Could we please just
         forget the whole thing?
Now, there
is no reason
why you should
miss that prom.
A girl would bcrazy
to turn you down.
So come on.
Who is she?
                  Red sweater.
Cute shoes.
                     Huh?
Go for it.
    Just waltz right up there
    and ask her out?
No, you've got to...
say something nice,
like how pretty
her eyes are.
Girls eat up
that crap.
                    Come on.
              Hi, Jeanine.
                             Hi.
I keep forgetting
your name.
             Rick... Morehouse.
You know, I sit
right next to you
in civics class?
You have
beautiful eyes.
I'll bet.
Do you have a--
a date for the prom?
Of course.
It's next week. Why?
     Official
     prom committee survey.
      Thank you very much.
                Terry...
             TERRY: This has got
             to be the one.
                You know why?
Because I've asked
everybody else.
            No. Because I've
            got this feeling.
            True, I've had
            this feeling before,
                but this time...
                     Uh... Beth.
Doing anything, uh, prom night?
I'm going to the prom.
            What about Saturday?
I'm busy.
                      Night?
I'm busy.
            How about Sunday?
I'm busy.
                  How about any
                  night in 1987?
I'm busy.
            How about yesterday?
            You busy yesterday?
I think so,
but you can
ask me out again.
        Hi, Terry.
Oh, hey, Sandy.
 Hey, word's out your friend's
 desperate for a prom date.
He would love
my cousin Jill.
She's cute.
        How cute?
        Extremely.
      She's got, like,
      Joan Collins' eyes,
Christie Brinkley's
teeth.
      Uh, well, what about
      the rest of her?
     Dynamite.
     Rick has to meet her.
     How about you and me,
     and Rick and Jill
all meet up at the cave tonight?
                      We'll have
                      a picnic.
             Uh...
Come on.
We'll have fun.
 This Jill better be some girl.

What are you doing?
                Just cleaning
                the house.
Budster,
are you all right?
      Huh... I am awesome.
Linda is on her way over.
      Huh, huh, huh, huh!
Excuse me, Mr. Romance,
just out of curiosity,
does this girl
have any idea
she's coming over here
to, uh,
light up your life?
        Well, technically
        speaking, not really.
        We'll probably start off
        with some algebra,
 but once I turn on the charm,
 she's mine.
            Hand me that massage
            book, please.
Bud, why don't you
take the subtle approach?
You know, maybe hang
a couple of salamis
from the ceiling.
Hey, at least my date
is someone of the opposite sex.
I'm just seeing Sandy for Rick.
                    For Rick?
                What happened
                to research?
Well, that's
what I meant.
        So for research,
you're willing to toy
with this poor girl's emotions?
        All you transvestites
        are alike.
        You disgust me,
but of course, that isn't
the real problem here.
      Oh really? What is?
            Well, this Sandy
            woman's hot for you.
What if she suddenly goes nuts
and tears all your clothes off?
That's what Craig Garfield said
Roxanne Doyle did.
            Yeah...
    What do I do then?
            Call me.
I could be there in 15 minutes.
    Wait, you can't call me.
                In fact, you
                can't come home.
            You'll have to sleep
            in the cave.
        The cave.
            Oh, God.
            I want to toast
            my good friend Rick,
              a guy with a great
              sense of humor.
And here's to summer.
I swear, sixth grade
is so bogus.
It's a joke.
            Want to take a walk?
            I think they need
            some privacy.
Jill...
You animal, you.
Come on.
                Hey, wait!
                Where you going?
 Hey, man, don't leave me now.
   <i>♪ I think I'm in trouble ♪</i>
    You kids have fun, huh?
They left me.
                 It's okay.
                 I'm still here.
  Sandy... You tricked me bad.
                          Uh-uh.
                  You know,
                  in five years,
            Jill's going to make
            him very happy.
Yeah, I'm sure.
                  Nice fire.
Sandy,
this is really--
                Shh. Don't talk.
Sandy, this is
a big mistake.
            Maybe, maybe not.
                There's only one
                way to find out.
    Sandy!
Sandy, really.
Sandy,
get out of there!
There really is a very
good explanation
for that.
                  I'm flattered.
            You are?
                 But you don't
                 have to do this
                  to impress me.
            I don't?
     No. I like you a lot.
    I think I'll take
    one of those beers now.
                      It's okay.
                I mean, how
                small can it be?
Don't ask.
                 More Cold Duck?
Sure.
Hit me again.
                If I give you
                five bucks,
                    would you go
                    see a movie?
Lien,
you little squirt,
Terry promised
she'd be home tonight,
and I'm not leaving
till I see her.
                If I give you
                10 bucks,
            would you go wait
            in your car?
We're on number 22.
Let's keep going.
            Bummer.
    If the coefficient
    of X
    is greater
    than that of Y,
and the coefficient
of Y
is greater
than that C,
then by the transit
of property,
what can be said about
the coefficient of X
         in relation to
         the coefficient of C?
                    Hold it!
                 It's time Kevin
                 knew the truth.
    Terry moved to Oregon
    to join a religious cult
  that she saw on <i>60 Minutes.</i>
    It's all in the letter.
         You should go home
         and wait for it, Kevin.
    Wait.
    Two more problems.
If the coefficient--
        Hi, Kevin.
                        Terry!
Back from the cult!
 Where the hell have you been?
          You're going to laugh.
         I was upstairs
         looking for this skirt,
            and I fell asleep
            in the closet.
 What did you do to your hair?
                Oh, I cut it.
         Isn't it cute?
        Cute? It's gone.
What are you,
drunk?
     You are. You're drunk.
Now, what's
going on here?
We're supposed
to get together.
      Kevin, honey, angel.
    I'll make it up to you.
    I promise.
When? Tonight?
      Let me tuck you in.
                I can't tonight.
     I'm working very hard
     on my article,
but I'll tell you what...
            I'll walk you out
            to the car, okay?
Gee, a walk
to the car?
Ta about
your wild nights, hmm?
Don't feel bad. It's okay,
  because while you were up
  in the closet getting drunk,
I got to do algebra.
     Oh, that's wonderful.
          Crazy kids.
            Well, alone at last.
Why are you
smiling like that?
        Because it's party time.
 Let's dance. Let's get crazy.
        Let's get drunk.
        Let's get naked.
Buddy, I love
a good party,
    but something about you
    worries me.
      Linda, you're a nut.
    What do you like,
    skinny dip in the pool?
    Back rub in the bedroom?
      Pick a sin. Any sin.
It's getting kind of late.
        NoIt's early.
        Bye.
        Linda, wait! For God's
        sake, I vacuumed, Linda.
Buddy, you're a nice guy.
No, not a "nice guy."
That's the kiss of death.
    I'll see you in algebra.
    Thanks for your help.
          Linda, wait.
     Would it make
     any difference at all
    if I said
    I was hung like a bear?
    It might. Are you?
              No.
                  Just checking.
        Goodbye, Buddy.
    I like your hair.
That girl had incredible
self-control.
                 Kevin hates me.
                 Rick hates me.
              Everybody hates me
              except Sandy.
Oh, yeah, how'd it go?
Did you get laid?
      I bet I came closer
      than you did.
Years from now,
Linda'll look back on this night
and be very sorry.
    Good night, Buddy.
         Sorry, Spike.
             Nothing much has
             been happening, Ma.
         Yeah, I did pretty good
         on my history test.
                  Terry's become
                  a transsexual.
         Yeah, she's starting to
         grow hair on her chest.
            Yeah, just a second.
                 Hey, Mom wants
                 to talk to you.
No, no.
                Uh, she can't
                talk, Mom.
                The doctors
                have advised her
                not to speak.
              Something hormonal
              and vocal.
                Besides,
                she's hung over.
         Yeah, she was out
         drinking with the guys.
                Okay, see you
                in a week.
                We miss you too.
                      Okay. Bye.
                  She thought
                  I was kidding.
        Yo, Rick!
Hi, Terry.
                Good morning,
                Mrs. Morehouse.
Rick, your friend
Terry's here.
                     Sorry about
                     last night.
    Hey, that's okay.
  If I was in the sixth grade,
I think I would've
had a big night.
- Come on, we're going out.
- Let me guess.
You got me a hot date
with Sandy's grandmother.
             No, no, no, listen,
 I figured the whole thing out.
There is nothing wrong with you
except for the way you dress.
Terry, it took me an hour
to put this look together.
Yeah, so don't try so hard
next time.
            Come on.
I don't have
any money.
      I got plastic.
      You can pay me back.
I just feel kind of weird.
    That's because your
    body's not used to style.
                  You'll adjust.
                 Hey, Deborah,
                 what's shaking?
Hi, Terry.
Hi...
             Rick.
Yeah, I know.
You look a little
different.
                    The kid went
                    shopping,
                  got a haircut.
                    Welcome
                    to the '80s.
Very sharp.
                 Thanks.
    Deb, what
    are you doing
    hanging around
    these chumpstains?
      Come on.
      Let's go.
I'll be
right there.
Now, Deborah.
Just
a second.
Greg just likes
to act tough.
He doesn't really
hate y guys.
              Oh, that's no act.
              He truly hates us.
Deep down,
he's insecure.
            Yeah, well, upfront,
            he's an asshole.
                 Take it easy,
                 Deborah.
What was that,
a pity stop?
[SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE]
                    ...pizza!
                      [LAUGHING]
Those guys are...
It's just about
showtime, boys.
    [MAKING WHIRRING NOISE]
I'm picking up
curious life readings.
                    Is it human?
Unknown.
It seems to be
some sort
of carbon-based
douchebag.
Whoop! Whoop!
Whoop!
                      Not again.
    Gentlemen, relax.
    Sit down.
        Too much stress,
    it's not good
    for your muscles.
    Have a nice lunch.
Hey, how you doing?
Nice jacket.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Spaghetti, too.
I think it stains.
Did I miss
something?
            Why didn't you slug
            that asshole anyway?
     He said he was sorry.
And you
believe him?
        Benefit of the doubt.
                Besides, the guy
                can lift cars.
      What are you doing?
 What's it look like I'm doing?
  Well, do you have to do that
  in here?
                 It felt like
                 the right time,
                certainly
                the right place.
              Terry, is this
              a problem for you?
No, no problem at all.
I was just kidding.
        It's just that you
        looked so nice today.
            You were perfect.
                     Hey, isn't
                     this great?
    Isn't what great?
 Well... You know, here we are,
 a couple of guys
 hanging out in the men's room,
leaning up against the urinals,
              talking about
              broads and fights.
              Just like a couple
              of guys, you know.
     This is what you call
     typical male bonding.
  You know, like Butch Cassidy
  and the Sundance Kid.
Oh, so that's what it is.
     Yes, it's great.
     I'm glad you told me.
  I just wish that Greg Tolan
  would join the gang.
      Oh, man, I've had it
      with that jerk.
    You want to know
    about Greg Tolan?
I'll tell you about Greg Tolan.
      Greg Tolan is toast.
            He can't get away
            with this.
                We've got
                to get him back.
    We and what army?
          No violence.
 No need to sink to his level.
You see, we have something
                that Greg Tolan
                will never have.
         Intelligence.
    You know, you're right.
I mean, we're smart.
Okay, Terry.
What do we do?
                I don't know.
Me neither.
Hey, man, this
stuff'll kill you.
Try this.
You'll live longer.
                     Thanks.
                     Looks good.
I made it myself.
          Can I finish
          those fries?
Buddy?
            Thanks.
What are you
doing here?
Looking for you.
Uh, Rick, this is
my younger brother, Buddy.
                  How you doing?
So. This is Rick.
  I've heard a lot about you.
A lot.
Bud, what
do you want?
Guess who came by to pick you up
for school this morning?
Your true love...
            Kevina.
Kevina was
very upset
that you left
without her.
You know how she worships
your rippling muscles
     and your hairy chest.
Terry's such
a stallion.
Go on.
Show him your hairy chest.
Buddy!
     Anyway, Kevina made me
     promise to tell you
that she's going to
be picking you up
for dinner
7:30 sharp,
    so you should look
    your handsomest.
Thanks for
the message, Bud.
          My pleasure.
Well...
I'm going to scope out
the local babes.
Hey, Rick,
stay real.
                Take it easy.
        You have a girlfriend
        named Kevina?
Rather exotic,
isn't it?
                     Stallion.
              Hi.
                Can I be totally
                honest with you?
                Your touch
                is the reason
                why I went
                through puberty.
        Sit down.
Guys, I just
want to apologize
about neglecting you
yesterday.
I felt terrible,
and I just
want you to know
you're still my favorite people.
        Sit down.
        Man, Terry, this crap
        has got to stop.
What are you
going to do?
        Um... Excuse me.
     Could I have
     your attention please?
                 Your attention?
             Every day at lunch,
                we get a very
                special treat
                    from a very
                    special guy.
              A guy who has
              dedicated his life
        to building his body,
pushing his muscles to the very
limits of human endurance.
                Why, you ask?
                            Why?
 Well, to be strong enough
 to lift tables and spill food.
          Greg Tolan!
    [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
                     Whoa. Wait.
                    Let's take
                    a moment now
                    to find out
                    a little bit
                about the man
                behind the mess.
Greg! May I call you Greg?
      Now, tell us, Greg,
  how did you first

                Were you
                a messy baby?
        [LAUGHTER]
Did you hate your strained peas?
                     [CHUCKLING]
                 Well, you know,
              most psychologists
              tell us that guys,
             well, they get into
             body building
                to compensate
    for either a lack of IQ
    or a small weenie.
              Which is it, Greg?
                         Well...
those of us in Greg's gym class
certainly know the answer
to that one.
        [LAUGHTER]
I'm going to beat the shit
out of you, Morehouse!
                Greg, please!
Hey, isn't he great?
Muscles and a sense of humor.
    [LAUGHTER AND MURMURING]
                  Well, let's
                  all thank Greg
     for the many lunchtime
     thrills and spills
         he's given us.
All right,
everybody, up!
Come on,
everybody up!
Grab the end
of your table.
    A tribute to you, Greg.
             Lift!
    We love you, Greg!
                  Everybody out!
                  Go on outside!
                          Now!
        Hold it, clown!
         Come on, Greg.
         Greg.
                  Lighten up.
                  It was a joke.
                 People laughed.
                 Let it slide.
Stay out
of this, Deborah.
                    I am getting
                    real bored
             watching you
             push people around.
Yeah? Well,
stick around,
because it's going
to get real exciting.
        You know,
        Terry was right.
You are an asshole.
             That asshole called
             me an asshole?
Oh, now you want
to beat him up too, right?
        No, I want to buy him
        an ice cream.
     [SINGING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]
Can't you ever
just be man enough
to walk away?
Watch. I'll show you
how it's done.
          Uh, you've got some
          pudding on your shoes.
        TERRY: You were
        outstanding. Phenomenal!
            So who are you going
            to ask?
Don't start this.
              You're practically
              a celebrity.
I'm having
a really great day.
Please, Terry,
don't spoil it.
We've gone too far to stop now.
Just ask one more person.
Anybody.
                And then I swear
                I'll shut up.
        Anybody?
             Anybody.
             Um...
                  This is, uh...
            This is going
            to sound crazy...
But what the heck,
you know,
it's been
a crazy day.
Would you like to go
with me to the prom?
              Yeah. I'd love to.
                Deborah,
                I don't think
                  you understood
                  the question.
                    The prom?
                I'd love to
                be your date.
Hi, Terry.
                 I'm going
                 with Deborah.
    I'm going with Deborah.
        Yow! Huh!
    That's really wonderful.
See, what did I tell you?
      You're a great guy.
It's about time
some lucky girl
figured it out.
            We've got to double.
                     Who are you
                     going with?
 Oh, I don't know if I'm going.
      You got to. Come on.
             Sandy.
    Oh, no way, man.
    That chick is dangerous.
      I don't need to go.
                    Yes, you do.
                After all you've
                done for me,
  we've got to get you a date,
      because, uh, Terry,
    I'm not going
    unless you're going too.
  I mean it.
  I'll tell Deborah right now.
I think I know
who to ask.
                    Okay!
 I was wondering, do you have
 plans yet for Saturday night?
I'm not sure.
Either I'm jetting
to Paris
or watching
 <i>The Love Boat.</i>
                  Denise...
Will you be my date at the prom?
 You are so sexually confused.
    Please, just say
    you'll go with me.
Why would you
want to go?
    Because I promised Rick,
and if I don't go,
he won't go with Deborah.
    Deborah...
    I am such a jerk.
I thought the whole point
was to get Rick a date.
    Yeah, but not her.
 I mean, what could he possibly
 see in her?
                  She's totally
                  wrong for him.
          Too pretty?
    No. She's trouble.
I guess Rick needs someone
a lot more sensitive.
More like you,
right?
     Why would I want Rick
     when I have Kevin?
Good question, but...
Do you like him?
Rick's not my type at all.
     Sure, with my help,
     he's come a long way.
 He stopped buying his clothes
 at Nerds 'R' Us.
I know you, Terry,
and you like him.
         He's research.
My article's due Monday.
I've got a lot
of good stuff,
but I still need something
to tie it all together.
      Yeah. You like him.
        Denise...
      Just say you'll go
      to the prom with me.
 I'll go to the prom with you.
                  Oh, thank you.
I want a limo.
And you can't
tell anyone,
not my friends,
not my parents, no one.
      Deal?
             Look, I'm not proud
             of this either.
God. Look how low
I've sunk,
and you know
what's really sad is,
you're the best date
I've had in weeks.
                  How do I look?
Beautiful.
              Kevin really loves
              this outfit.
            I want to look
            really nice for him.
I guess you two haven't
had much time together
        since the sex change.
That's cute.
            Hey, Denise.
            What's your rush?
        We're young. We're wild.
              Let's be young
              and wild together.
I'd rather
get the phone book
and pick a name
at random.
              Hi. Is Terry home?
    Yeah. Come on in.
Hey, Terry,
you've got company!
    Come on up,
    I'm almost ready!
Hey, we can go
to your place.
It's cool.
I'm very flexible.
        Oh, shit.
                          Terry?
    Uh, don't come in.
    I'm dressing.
              Ter?
    I'll be right out.
                Hey, Sandy. What
                a nice surprise.
These are for you.
They're kissing fish,
to say sorry
about the cave.
                      Yeah. I'm
                      sorry too.
          [WHISTLING]
      Hey, how'd you know
      where I lived?
I followed you.
Why don't you go to Pearl?
                    Oh, I hate
                    that school,
                 bunch of snotty
                 rich kids.
                  Anyway, thanks
                  for the fish.
                I'll put them
                by my bed.
      Oh, that's perfect.
      Is that your room?
 Oh, no, no. It's my brother's.
                  That's my room
                  over there.
  Well, let's see how they look.
            Help me.
I think they'll look
good over here.
    Wow. Like,
    this is where you sleep?
    Do your homework?
Yeah, well, uh...
I like pictures of people.
Terry loves tits and ass.
These women
just aren't tits and ass.
      Kim reads Vonnegut,
      and Louann...
  Louann despises toxic waste.
                Don't let him
                fool you.
      Hardcore sex maniac.
    Well, Terry treated me
    with nothing but respect.
                Very special.
                      Yeah.
                 He's one of
                 a kind, my bro.
        [DOORBELL RINGS]
Hey, I wonder if that
could be your pal, Kevin.
Yeah, Kevin.
Why don't you
go downstairs
and tell Kevin
I'm not quite ready,
and could he please
wait for me in the car?
              I tried that once.
                He doesn't like
                waiting in cars.
     [DOORBELL RINGS]
Thanks for stopping by,
but as you can see,
I really am in a rush.
                  First, there's
                  something else
                    I have
                    to give you.
     Oh, nothing could top
     these fish.
                        Don't be
                        so sure.
     Oh, my God, the fish.
Did you
feed them today?
Look at those
hungry little eyes.
They're kissing.
                 They're turning
                 cannibal.
        Here, feed them this,
          and I'll see what
          I have in the kitchen.
    Do you guys like pizza?
            Buddy...
             Kevin!
                Ah, here she is.
      What are you
      doing here so early?
It's 7:30.
I'm right on time.
            7:30...
                I could've sworn
                you said 8:30.
             I'll tell you what,
 I'll go get ready, and you can
 come back for me in an hour.
          Terry, you know
          damn well I said 7:30.
         You said you'd be ready
         and dressed to kill.
So why do you
look like hell?
         I don't know.
            Buddy, can I see you
            for a minute?
"I don't know?"
You're so great
under pressure.
              Listen, there's
              a half-naked woman
    feeding pizza to some fish,
                she's all yours.
Sounds too kinky
for me.
            Budster, I need you.
            She needs you.
                You need her.
She really
half-naked?
              Maybe more by now.
What if you're lying?
                What if I'm not?
Good point.
If I'm not back in a week,
forward my mail.
        Kevin, darling.
             Hello.
         Where's Terry?
             Gone.
                  This isn't
                  the first time
                that androgynous
                sleaze bucket
          has broken a beautiful
          girl's heart.
I'm so embarrassed.
                        Why?
                 The room's full
                 of naked women.
      Wait. Would you feel
      more comfortable
    if I took my shirt off?
    What a nice girl.
                Well, we can't
                go to Giovanni's
              with you being
              dressed like that.
      Sure we can.
      We'll get it to go.
 A long time ago,
 I knew this girl named Terry.
 She wore dresses and make-up.
 e was hot...
    And then, one day,
    she disappeared.
             Do you know
             where did she went?
    She's right here.
You know,
I'm still the same person,
and is that all you
care about, that I'm hot?
No, that's not all I care about.
Look, I'm under pressure.
My article's due Monday.
    Terry, what is it
    with this article?
    I mean, it's nice
    to have a hobby,
                    but let's
                    get serious.
            A hobby?
  I didn't-- I didn't mean...
  Hobby, like, just a hobby.
I, uh... I meant hobby,
like, an important hobby.
            Well, how do I look?
    Dashing.
            My zipper's open.
That was the dashing part.
Budmeister, are you okay?
No, Terry,
I'm not.
 Mom and Dad come home Monday.
    I've had two weeks
    of total freedom.
  The closest I've come to sex
was a girl who took her top off
to seduce my sister.
     What's wrong with me?
                    Not a thing.
              Listen, sex is not
              that big a deal.
I'd like to form my own opinion.
                It'll happen.
I know this place
that delivers.
 Massage Delight or something.
 Can I borrow $200?
    Buddy, why don't you just
    call the guys
             and go to the mall?
    I'd rather wallow
    in my virginity.
      [TELEPHONE RINGING]
              Buddy, you know
              I can't answer it.
                 Please? This
                 is almost over.
             Yeah.
    Yeah, Terry's here.
    I'll see if it can talk.
      It's Mr. Wonderful.
                  Hi, Kevin.
            No. I can't tonight.
         Listen, we have to have
         a serious talk.
             Yes. It's about us.
    [CAR HORN HONKING]
             Listen, can we talk
             about this later?
                    I got to g--
                     Bye, Kevin.

mealworms or flies.

do that to you?

              a real commitment.

of the prom?

You know, now that I
take a good look,
they really do make
a nice couple.
Normally, we'd have
the traditional
king and queen's
dance,
     however, as chairwoman
     of the prom committee,
I've decided that
that's a stupid tradition.
             So everybody dance!

Tolan,
you're a creep!
      You son of a bitch!
            I'm going to scratch
            your eyes out!
     Oh...
          TERRY: Help!
              You dumb ox!
              You're in trouble!
Stop it!
                    Put me down!
                    Put me down!
          Yah! Wo-aah!
      Shit, where'd these
      guys learn to fight?
        Okay, tough guy.
You want a piece of me now, huh?
      My back's not turned
      the other way.
 Nice tux.
 You'll look good buried in it.
            No pain, no gain.
        [APPLAUSE]
Hey, Ter.
                      Buddy?
    I missed you.
Terry, are you
all right?
                        Kevin?
          Hey, Sandy!
What are you
doing here...
In a tuxedo?
     Please go home.
     I'll call you tonight.
                Who is this guy?
Terry's boyfriend.
Who are you?
                  Just a friend.
Terry, we can
work this out.
I know you still
love me.
          No, I don't.
      I love someone else.
            Whoa, uh, thanks,
            but no, thanks--
Look, Terry,
we belong together.
You're my g--
    Hold that thought.
     Can I talk to you
     for one brief moment?
      I'll be right back.
What's going on?
        Wait. It gets better.
     Yeah. Big night, huh?
I bet
you're a little confused.
     I think I understand.
I know I should've
told you sooner,
      but, uh... I didn't.
        Um... I'm a g--
                        Terry...
            I know.
          You're gay.
          I'm not gay.
    Wait a minute.
    Now I'm confused.
          I'm a girl.
I'm a woman.
             Right,
                and I'm
                Cyndi Lauper.
                 Could we please
                go back to
                the prom now?
     I'm a female, I swear.
    Rick...
Wait a minute,
are those what I think they are?
        I'm sorry.
      Where do you get off
      having tits?
There was this contest,
and I needed to prove it,
    but then I stayed,
    and I met you,
and you're so wonderful that...
     Shit...
     I can't believe this.
Rick, I know
you're mad,
  but I think you're terrific,
      and your friendship
      means so much to me
that I just--
     Then this whole thing
     was bullshit.
        Major bullshit.
Rick, wait!
    You've got to understand
    how much you mean to me.
You've got to believe me.
        Right, Terrence,
 because you've been so honest
 up till now.
              So how's the fish?
They're great. I put a frogman
in the bowl,
and you know what?
They really do
love pizza.
Rick, can't you
just forgive me?
                    No, I can't.
    Rick...
      [CROWN GASPS LOUDLY]
     It's okay, everybody.
     It's all right.
                    He has tits.
                        What?
         Come on, Deb.
         Let's go.
                     No, I don't
                     believe it.
Tits?
      Whoa! 9:15 already.
    Well... Gotta go.
    Had a lovely time.
Have a nice prom.
                        Hi.
            You're probably
            here with a date.
Yeah.
              <i>[♪]</i>
          Night, son.
 Buddy, why'd you bring Kevin?
                Good evening.
            Whoops.
Hey, no problem.
        Just a couple of nice,
        clean, all-American kids
         experimenting with sex.
             You remember Sandy,
             the fish girl?
      Hi.
             Hello.
                TERRY: You know,
            my voyage of
            self-discovery...
     Has ended in despair.
                 Hey, that's
                 so interesting.
                     Really.
          Could you shut
          the light off, please?
             I'm seeing Julian
             again this weekend.
                  He is so cool.
        I can't believe
        I finally lucked out.
Denise, he is
the lucky one.
Hey, Terry,
is it true
you broke up
with that
college guy?
        It's true.
You want to go out
Saturday night?
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I'm really not ready.
                Well, what
                about Sunday?
                You think that's
                enough time?
      No. Thanks.
            Terry, you have
            to snap out of this.
    I will.
It just may take me
a couple of years.
Terry?
I really liked
your article.
Especially the part
about how
you can be cool
even though if you don't
dress cool and stuff.
I feel the same way.
You want to go out
sometime?
                Oh... I'm really
                not ready yet,
              but thanks anyway.
Shelley,
wait up.
                     Terry!
                Can you come
                in here, please?
        Mr. Raymaker...
Come on
into my office.
             I read your article
             in the <i>Sun-Tribune.</i>
                 Congratulations
                 on winning.
Thanks.
    It was real good,
 and I'm sorry I misjudged you.
You don't have
to apologize.
    I wouldn't have this job
    if it weren't for you.
 I mean, you forced me to fight
 for what I wanted,
  and I will never forget you
for that.
      Thank you.
      I learned a lot too.
 What about that kid
 you wrote the article about...
                        Rick?
          He hates me.
     Well, that's too bad.
You really like him, don't you?
      Why do you say that?
      I read your article.
      Don't worry.
      I'm a stunt driver.
    I do this for a living.
                Swift parking
                job, Bud,
                and you're late.
Yeah, I ran out
of gas,
but don't worry,
I put a buck's worth in...
             on me.
      Terry, it's summer.
      Smile.
                My face hurts
                when I smile.
Listen to me,
oh, sister of my loins,
I've got
a driver's license
and a sex life.
You've got the job
of your dreams
and a chauffeur.
Life is sweet.
Let's get
an ice cream.
Uh, it's, uh,
for you.
You look very good in a dress...
Very good.
    I thought you hated me.
         I missed you.
I read your article.
         Do you, uh...
    still feel the same way
    about me?
      Yeah, I guess I do.
 Well, hey, why don't we go out
 and have some fun?
        You know, like, maybe
        we could go dancing
         Friday night.
Wait a minute.
I'm the guy here.
Let me just
try this, okay?
Why don't we go out
dancing Friday night?
          What an original idea.
            Hey, you want
            to go for a ride?
Yeah.
                        Come on.
As long as
I get to drive.
                 Come on, Buddy!
