That's why I like to play

You are welcome.
I think I spoke earlier

Ia paroxysmal tachycardia.
Let's control.
Now who gets seated.
Look at the light...
Without moving his head.
Fermo.
Yup.
- He's had more panic attacks?
- No.
That's why I'm scared.
It seemed as if my heart
would explode at any moment.
A lightning stroke.
- He suffered heart?
- Not that I know.
But it had been operated
on for breast cancer.
There is no relationship between the two.
- How old were you?
- 38 years.
At 38 years if there
are no heart...
And then what would a
fulminating heart attack?
My father told me so.
Things that are said...
She likes very
reassure his patients.
I prefer to tell the truth.
Anyway, mine was just a
statistical thinking.
He asked the reason for these attacks?
Where they come from?
I told him... is the first time.
I can control myself.
As a child after the death of my
mother I had someone who helped me...
That gave me some advice...
Sometimes they were real orders.
It was a rather authoritarian.
- His father?
- No.
Then who? A friend?
A true friend...
Although in reality it did not exist.
- Belphegor.
- Belphegor?
- You know?
- Sure!
And who has not seen a child!
It was frightening.
My mother was hypnotized.
Eh?
It actually helped me a lot.
I defended.
- From what?
- From everything.
From pain.
He was prevented from going mad.
Without discussing.
Whatever he asks me to do.
And then?
And then nothing.
They became great.
Now that you know what...
Do not lose your head.
Forget belphegor.
Thank you.
- I do not take anything?
- There is no need to give her the drugs.
At least for now.
Phones a friend.
A person who is near.
It may be you this person?
What do we do now?
<lt is still here?
I told the truth before.
I was Sincere.
Then he trusts me.
Where do we go?
Good night.
The alleged universe age
has gradually lengthened.
It was discovered that the earth
is not the center universe...
But that is only one
of many bodies...
That inhabit...
And that his life comes
from the light of a star.
Ii sun.
Light is life.
What it is said of a
creature when it is born?
What has come to light.
Knock knock... come to light it too.
Laughs.
You do not love me.
Now the theories that attempt to
explain the origin universe...
They are numerous and all
worthy of respect...
Not only because of the
effort of those who apply...
I have a question.
Then the '... to' as well.
What was there before?
The formation of the earth
is billions of years old.
But even before...
Before the universe was born.
Before... even before?
So you jump from
science to philosophy.
We enter the field of faith.
- So?
- What do you want us to be?
Just god. Nothing else.
He is the creator of the universe.
There would be one too.
There must be to make
sense of our existence.
It is the only hope.
The only light.
But even for the dead, is
that light still there?
At the end of the world.
We will see it all...
Live with the dead.
Sound of bell.
Ite!
- Father.
- Good morning.
Hello..
Let's go.
Father.
I want to know.
- What?
- The answer.
Ii only way to get an answer is
to continue to ask the question.
Never stop asking.

You pray?
Defend your faith.

The school is closed for a while.
And then what sense does it
turn all of these bulbs?
Do not prepare the lie.
He must shine.
Little boy.
You should be in
your home right now.
But god is light.
Do you think they will be sufficient
light bulbs of this church...
To recreate the light of
the kingdom of heaven?
I try to do all I can to
get closer to paradise.
I know.
I understand you.
But why tell your companions
that your mother is alive?
Of course it's alive!
Life is eternal because
the soul is immortal.
She taught me.
Do not think you confuse me.
The talk of this world.
Sit down.
Your lie...
It is harmless to those who listen...
But not for you ..
Your mother is dead.
It is to be yl you have to start.

But the important and react to pain.
Do not play the victim.

Ie injustices...
Although your mother is dead.
Courage.
Be brave.

Tasks for tomorrow I do not.
Remove your feet from the bed.
What's up?
But you have just
seen dying mother?
No..
How did she die? You know?
Yup..
That night I woke
up with a start.
Mom was not the bed.
Outside it was snowing and cold.
I found it here in your room
that you tuck the blankets.
He reassured me and
went back to bed.
Mother wanted to say hello.
But no wake.
True?
Anything.
I went back to bed
and fell asleep.
In your room.
Maybe you missed your breath
because it took off the robe...
But without calling...
In order not to wake anyone.
They always came first.
In the hallway.
A lightning stroke.
From beauty treatments...
Ii his heart gave out.
But he did not abandon us.
It was as if she minded
more for us than for her.
Come on... do not cry.
<please.
Ia prayer that the
community of believers...
He raises to you by faith in the lord...
And confirm for us the beata speranza
that with the dead brothers...
We rise again in Christ to new life.
We ask this through Christ our lord.
Amen.

Wait.
I wish you took this to you.
- But what's the hurry? And then here?
- Where else?
Maximum.
Take it.
Maximum.
I know what you have suffered.
I should have done more.
Let's talk about something else?
All my life we're talking
about something else.
How beautiful...
And so full of joy.
You do not know how much I loved her.
As he laughed.
Do you remember how he laughed?
<phonebook is dead...
And the proof is the number of
letters arriving. Very few.
We close the book and amen!
I'll go fishing.
<your answers have
become too cruel.
See all black.
Knights? There's a letter here.
I want to read.
<i do not say that you save but at
least talking about a real feeling.
Hatred.
"This letter I wrote it
thinking of my mother..."
And the feelings I have for her.
I think my mother has
never loved anyone...
Tricking all so that
felt a perfect Donna...
A loving mother always present.
Instead it is totally absent.
But only I notice.
And I hate it.
Ia hate!
Because hatred is the only feeling
that was able to send me.
When I was a child...
I would stay at least the
memory of a boundless love...
But no! I want to kill her...
With my hands.
I am disgusting for
these thoughts...
"Oh yeah!
As a mother there is only one."
Signed: Simone.
"Mona". Laughs
you know what I should say to this?
Relax and do a good deed.
Kill your mother and fired
a shot in the head...
So you get off
both by the balls.
You can say this to
a Mona suffering?
Can not be done.
And above all you should not.
Then I get up white flag.
I give up...
And hop! I go fishing!
We go out of balls.
Back to work.
- Max.
- Yup?
Can I hold you a minute?
Why do not you try to
reply to that letter?
I? Because?
Go straight without patetismi.
Feelings are not my forte.
I know what the topic... touches you.
Your mother's.
Of how you lost a child.
I was at the news.
Ii director...
What turns you on my mind.
When your mother died.
Who knows how many tears you shed.
Metticele inside these tears.
Metticele in!
Do not be ashamed.
And do not read.
Hmm?
Dear Simon...
I'm afraid I have no right
to respond to the letter...
Except one that I'm
not proud of course.
They are lost his
mother as a child.
I was nine years old when he died.
Panic...
It was impossible that there was more.
Every time I came home i
thought to find her...
Of yl see her in the
kitchen with the radio on.
I opened my eyes in the dark...
Sure to find her sitting
on the edge of the bed.
For me it was not dead.
To my friends who told
her he lived in America.
Then I grew up I stopped talking
about it and thinking about her.
I did not want to suffer.
Who loved me was gone and
i did not love anyone.
But to survive.
If now I can write about
it because I understand...
That sooner or later the
frighteningly pain returns.
And you have to accept it.
I accepted the fate
for letting her away.
That's all.
Dear Simon...
It is only for one reason.
Because she understands the difference...
Although he may feel in
conflict with his mother...
Button matter how
resentful towards her...
It still has the good
fortune resent a mother.
Of her with him.
His mother is alive.
"Are you at home?"
And breathe after he responded.
I was told that the last
act of my mother...
The night when she left
was to come into my room...
I slept.
"I have not noticed."
Make beautiful dreams.
His mother has had
gestures of affection...
That did not understand...
Or just do not remember.
Invisible.
We risk remember only
the negative things.
But let's say that his
mother has ever embraced...
I do not ever smile
or made a caress.
Imagine if she now without
even closing the newspaper...
He get up and corrected
to embrace it now.
That would run the risk?
Do not make the situation worse.
And who knows, embracing it as well...
No pluck in the face of his
mother at least a look of wonder...
A tear.
"Corra Simone.
Corra de her with open arms."
Now what should we do? Hug?
I left something for you.
<max!
Maximum! You were great!
The celebrity!
- Hello.
- Hello..
Ringing cell.
- Ready?
- <Dear Max!
You've really surprised.
Me neither in its
heyday would be able...
To sell your soul as you did.
Listen...
I wanted to tell you.
You do street!
Another in your place
would have stopped...
But you were able to put under
your feet your mother...
While to make nice with readers
trumpeting your fucking pain.
Massimino?
It makes you a blowjob!
Belphegor belphegor...
Ringing cell.
Yup?
<i am Elisa.
Electric shock cock! Holy shit.
Voices in the distance
try to go back.
Eh? I recommend.
<smile!
The lady with the hat has
to go in the middle.
<come here otherwise we do not see.
<let it go. Here it comes...
Be careful not to cover you with
each other. Happy and smiling.
<careful not to cover you!
Well done!
Finished. Thank you!
Applause - boos.
Now we open the dances! Waltz!
Waltz music.
You finally arrived.
I'm lost.
At one point the road ended.
It is not easy to get here.
I noticed.
Ia music... and i
found the house.
I tripped and got the
shock of a thread...
But it lightly.
What is this party?
They are the diamond wedding
of my grandparents.
- Sixty years of marriage?
- Yup.
Argentina.
We are all here.
And the first time and maybe the last.
Let's dance the waltz!
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
- How should I call it? Doctor?
- Massimo's fine.
- Can I talk to her?
- Yup.
So lucky!
Perhaps the disorder.
Never mind. Maybe give her annoyance.
But I'm so excited to meet you.
- Look, I'm serious.
- I believe you.
I so appreciated your letter...
Thanks ..
I cried.
There are obvious
things that upset.
Even my life has not been easy.
- I spent some moments.
- I'm sorry.
The financial disasters.
They went from one
disappointment.
And can you imagine what i
was thinking at that moment.
He understands everything.
I mean...
I just thought of that.
Even a mother can be
a scary selfishness.
It is they who have kept me.
Infinitely present...
So I said no to bad thoughts.
And then her letter made
me realize many things.
Thank you.
For example, what is the pain
of a son who lost a mother.
This I did, however...
That risk.
But it's a party!
The I was just saying how much
i appreciate his sensitivity.
The did congratulate
you for your letter.
And you liked the letter?
- Do you like it or not?
- Why, yes... yes!
I can not dance.
Music
verses incitement
music in the background.
No!
Hello.
I know it is very late.
I'm emptying the house.
I'm making a mess.
You can come?
Please.
- Check.
- Thank you.
<hello.
- Hello! How are you?
- Good.
- What is happening?
- Anything. Come in.
What a mess!
I'm releasing everything.
Come.
I'm sorry.
You can come?
I looked at her album.
Stars and star.
Do you want a bit 'of water?
You can keep it if you want.
I'm going to throw it all away.
I want to burn everything.
You're not.
I do not do the crazy but...
Just.
Now I'm older than
she is five years.
It makes a great impression.
And I will always be older.
How did she die my mother?
You do not answer me?
What does it say how she died?
You still do not answer me.
You know.
You must tell me you.
I want to hear from you.
Why did not you ever tell me?
That your father had told you...
What I had figured it
out in thirty years.
Acute fulminant.
But how did you permission?
Do not understand it alone.
Is it okay to ten years, but at twenty?
Thirty years?
No one came to mind to take me
aside and tell me the truth.
My father went on to tell me
shit even on his deathbed.
Other than Napoleon!
Acute fulminant...
It just blames Mia.
It just blames Mia.
A coward.
I have not wanted to understand.
I always had it in
front of the truth.
Even me.
Especially me.
Maximum.
You may not know how much.
So much despair.
What what'?
It takes more courage to raise your
child to throw it from the fifth floor.
Your mother was scared
by the disease.
She believed that doctors were lying.
It was crazy?
If he was mad he should open
the throttle and kill us all.
- Stop it! Your mother loved you!
- Enough! Enough!
Just.
How many unnecessary tears...
Let her go.
24...
25!
I did!
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
It is no longer fun.
Mom!
Mom!
Where are you?
Enough!
Mom!
Where are you? Mom!
Mom!
I'm here.
The mother laughs
I've made a joke.
Do you want to see?
Here.
Want to join?
Here it is.
- We remain here?
- Yup.
Yup?
Ride
