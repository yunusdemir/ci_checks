Josh, what are you doing?
Josh, what are you doing?
Yeah!
Josh, what are you doing?
Jesus, Andy, calm down, have a beer.
Cheers.
What are we doing? We shouldn't be here.
Wait, did you hear that?
Don't be such a pussy, Andy.
Well, hi, guys, welcome, come on in.
Let's all go see Santa.
Wanna go see Santa?
Where's Santa?
I see Santa.
You see Santa?
- So what's your name?
- My name is Donny.
Donny, what could Santa Claus
get you for Christmas this year?
I'd really like to get
the game Black Ops Three.
Mm, that's some sort
of computer game, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.
- Why don't you give your thumbs a break.
How 'bout getting outside?
How 'bout a nice baseball?
Or a basketball? Or a football?
Something like that.
I hate playing outside, it's boring.
Well, how 'bout a little puppy dog?
Or a little furry kitten?
Learn some responsibility.
I hate dogs and cats.
They're all ugly and smell bad.
Well, you know, Donny, you don't
always get what you want for Christmas.
Santa sometimes brings you what you need.
- Ow!
- You're a fake.
Hey! Come back here.
What's your last name?
Baker, with a B.
Hi, I just wanted to say thank you so much
for coming in and doing this for the kids.
It really means so much to them.
Absolutely,
anything for the little children.
Aw, thank you so much.
We really appreciate it.
- You're welcome. Have a merry Christmas.
- Well, thank you, you too, sir.
- You're gonna sit with Mads, okay?
- You're just gonna look at me.
Look at Santa.
You gonna tell Santa
what you want for Christmas?
How 'bout you, Dave?
You get any reception on that thing yet?
- Nothing. This is it though.
- All right.
Hey, listen.
I know he hasn't seen anybody
in a very long time,
so I'm not sure how he's gonna take
us being here, so do me a favor,
- don't touch anything, okay?
- Yes, sir.
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
- What do you want?
- It's okay, Paul.
We're just here to talk.
That's it, we just wanna talk.
It's okay. He's with me.
- Friends of yours?
- No!
I saw them walking along the treeline.
I wanted to make sure
there was nothing going on.
Thanks, Monk.
What are you doing here, Dave?
- It's happening again.
- What's happening?
The missing children.
The missing children, are you kidding me?
That's what he does.
That's what he's always done.
- It will always happen.
- It's different this time, Jeremy.
It's happening way earlier,
and it's way more intense.
And what does that have to do with me?
What does that have to do with me, huh?
You're the only one that's gotten close
to him, and we need your help.
No!
We never found her, Jeremy.
We never found your daughter.
You leave her out of this! What the hell
does she have to do with anything?
- We found signs of her.
- Signs? Who the fuck is this?
Jeremy, we need your help.
If you don't wanna come back with me,
at least point me in the right direction
where we can start looking for this thing.
'Cause we're out of options.
Is Gil in on this?
So is Harry.
I'll go.
If that's what it takes.
I'm on the scene at the Edinburgh police
station where citizens gathered early today
to address their concerns
about the police's attempt
to apprehend the person responsible
for the recent string of missing children.
Hey, officer!
Officers Paul Sharp and Lead Investigator
Dave Kane briefly addressed the crowd.
The media has been advised to refrain
from photography at this time.
It has also been rumored
that former officer Jeremy Duffin
has been brought in to help
assist police in the apprehending
of the person or persons responsible
for the missing children.
- What about my niece?
- Listen, listen.
- We're doing the best we can right now?
- That's bullshit!
Captain Farabee will be holding
a press conference tomorrow morning.
I suggest that you are all there. We have
good information that's come to fruition
that we'll be sure to pass on.
That's all I got to say right now.
Hey! Come back here!
Jeremy Duffin is the police officer whose wife
was murdered and daughter went missing
almost five years ago today.
We will have more on this story
as the day progresses.
This is Rob Sanderson
with Channel Five News signing out.
Donny, it's time for bed.
Hey! Did you hear me?
Hey!
Do you hear me?
I'm gonna take that thing away
from you for about a week.
All right, that's it. Butt in bed, now.
Go to bed.
I'll be up to check on you in a second.
Mom?
Mom, I think there's something
under my bed.
There is nothing under your bed.
Pain in the ass kid.
Donny?
Donny.
Donny.
Oh, my God. Donny.
Donny! Donny!
Donny!
Donny! Donny!
Donny!
Donny! Donny! Donny!
Donny! Donny!
Donny, where are you? Donny!
Donny! Somebody call...
- Amy. What's going on, what's going on?
- You have to help me.
- Donny's gone. Donny's gone.
- I heard you from the house.
That thing got him,
that thing, he got him!
- Let's go inside and call the police.
- No, I'm gonna get my shotgun...
No, no, we can't. No, we can't, we can't.
Let's go inside and call the police.
That's the only thing that's gonna help him.
Let's call the police.
- Donny.
- Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
What's with all those people?
That's an everyday occurrence
around here now.
Paul, can you help me with this?
- I'll give you a call if we need you.
- You got it.
Any problems?
No, not really, but I see our crowd
outside hasn't gotten any smaller.
- Jeremy.
- Captain.
- How are you?
- Good to see you, too.
- You look great.
- How have you been? Harry.
- Jeremy. Jeremy?
- Yeah, it's me.
- Good to see you, Harry.
- Good to see you again.
Uh, Captain, hey, uh, this is, uh, Monk.
Very good friend of mine.
Nice to meet you.
Jeremy's told me a lot about you.
It's nice to meet you. Um, this is Lori,
Lori Taylor from Buffalo PD.
Hi. Gil's told me lots
of nice things about you.
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
- Um, you and I, we, uh...
- What?
We both have children that were taken.
We've both been, uh,
trying to hunt this thing.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
My child, he was taken about
the same time as yours actually.
I mean, I was right there at home.
I was there, right there when it happened.
Me, too. I was there when he
took my daughter. And, um...
I heard, I'm so sorry.
- Captain.
- What?
It's Donny Baker, he's missing.
We got an officer at the house,
but Amy's asking specifically for you.
Jesus Christ. She's still at the house?
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
- All right.
- Come on, boys, we're going for a ride.
- Come on, Monk.
Hey, kids, it's Santa Claus.
Woo! We gonna have some fun today?
Jing-jing-a-ling, it's killing time.
Hey, my little tart.
You wanna hear some Christmas music?
Come on, sure you do.
Why don't we get a little
Christmas picture of ya?
Let's see what we got here.
"To Santa,
I'm not gonna tell you my name."
I'm not gonna read your fucking letter.
What have we got here?
"Dear Mr. Claus."
Actually, it's Mr. Kringle.
Whatever.
"I would like to have a brand, shiny,
new bicycle for Christmas this year."
Well, we'll see about that.
And his name's not on the list.
He'll probably get a real bike this year.
But you...
Thanks, brother.
Hard to see without my glasses on.
You, Donny, you are all on this list.
Right here.
You remember this?
Yeah, that's right, that was me.
But that's not why
you're on this list either.
So, the reason you're on this list is
'cause what you did to the Johnson kid.
- I...
- I. I, I, I, I.
You, "I" what?
I, I, I'm sorry.
You're sorry.
You're a waste of breath is what you are.
Hell, probably doing society a favor.
10 years from now,
they won't even miss you.
Sorry, kid,
but you brought this on yourself.
There's no halfway
with you today, is there?
- String up another one.
- Yes.
No!
Brother, you're gonna like this.
- They're bringing Jeremy Duffin back.
- Jeremy.
Hey, little Donny. This is gonna be fun.
What a very productive week
this is gonna be.
Yep. Everything's coming together.
You gotta help me.
It took him, that thing.
- It took my little Donny.
- Who did?
- That thing took him!
- Which way?
- Which way? Which way? Which way?
- He went over that way. Please.
Please, he took Donny. He took Donny.
I'm gonna find him,
I'm gonna find that son of a bitch
- and I'm gonna fucking kill him myself!
- Okay, we're gonna go down.
- Please, you have to find him.
- Let's go in the house.
Jeremy, where are you going?
- What'd you find?
- It's Heather's, Gil.
Are you sure?
Yeah, it's the one she had when she
went missing that day, when he took her.
- Doesn't surprise me, doesn't surprise me.
- What do you mean?
We found some other stuff of hers.
A cellphone, slippers.
- I don't understand.
- She's the only body we didn't find.
- What?
- She could still be alive.
What are you saying?
You think she's alive?
I hope so.
God.
- I gotta find him.
- We'll find him.
You aren't going to believe
who I just saw.
Who?
- Well, spit it out, TJ.
- Jeremy Duffin.
- Where?
- At the police station.
I was driving through town,
I saw some commotion,
decided to check it out.
- Did they see you?
- Absolutely not.
- Wait, who is Jeremy Duffin?
- Jeremy is the pig that killed his brother.
He's probably back
because of all the missing kids.
Yeah, no doubt.
What do the missing kids
have to do with anything?
This former cop believes that there's
some kind of monster taking the children.
Whatever, I could give a shit.
Are you okay?
My brother Brian, God rest his soul,
had an unfortunate encounter
with Officer Jeremy Duffin.
He's the cop that put him away.
Somehow, while he was out on parole,
my brother ended up at this cop's house,
and the cop shot him dead.
He claimed self-defense,
and that was the end of it. Case closed.
Well...
Well, I want payback.
I want his punk-ass to suffer.
I want his death to be slow and painful.
But the timing has to be just right.
It's an advantage having him here.
Means there'll be more open space
for us to do our work in.
- Who was he with?
- The police captain,
- and that other guy, the old bartender.
- Harry.
10 to one they'll end up at the bar
across the street from Harry's old place.
That's where all the cops hang out now.
Go check things out.
Take Trevor and Natasha with you.
- Do you want us to get Jeremy?
- If possible.
Otherwise, figure out a way to lure him.
And take him where?
Some place secluded.
I wanna have a serious heart-to-heart
with that son of a bitch,
and not worry about cops showing up.
The old Kelly house off of 322.
I don't think anybody's
been there in years.
- Great idea.
- The hunt is on.
- Alive, I want him alive!
- You got it.
- TJ.
- Sir?
I'm putting you in charge of this.
Don't fuck it up.
And make sure my girl stays safe, capiche?
Understood.
<i>Jeremy Duffin, the police officer
whose wife was murdered</i>
<i>and daughter went missing
almost five years ago today.</i>
<i>We will have more on the story...</i>
Hey!
- Hey.
- What?
We got a job to do.
You're being reckless.
You're leaving yourself too exposed.
This list...
see this shit here?
This little Adam Fillabon?
Yes.
He beat up a kid over his lunch money.
I know it's not
all that big of a deal, but, still.
He needs to be punished.
You're right.
He also kicked a dog.
You know how I feel about animals.
I know.
There's a lot of other kids, too,
and not just here.
We got a lot of ground to cover,
and a little bit of time.
This place...
this place harbors some shit, doesn't it?
Yes.
I don't want you to be mad
about this Duffin thing.
We'll get to him when we get time.
Do you understand?
No more of this rogue shit.
Yes.
These two little shits come first.
And I hate to tell you, there's a lot
of kids that need punished around here.
Why do ya think we're
in this shit weather so early?
I'd much rather be in the Caribbean.
I understand.
- How's the girl, is she okay?
- Yes.
She's gonna be good for us.
She's gonna help us out in the long run.
Now get your horns on straight.
Let's get ahead of the game here.
Get ahead of schedule.
That way we can take care of Duffin.
Yes, we will.
- Gil.
- Yeah?
You really think
there's a chance she's alive?
Well, we never found the body.
So there's always hope.
It's just been driving me crazy
all these years.
- Looking for a body, never finding her body.
- I'm sure, turn left here.
After five years, I just...
I just don't understand how...
how that could be possible.
That bracelet.
That bracelet looked new.
That bracelet didn't look old.
If that bracelet was out there
for 5 years, it would've been tarnished,
- it would've been...
- That doesn't make any sense.
- That bracelet...
- It's her bracelet, Gil.
I know.
He's got her. I've gotta find her.
We'll find her.
- All right, Gil.
- All right, partner.
- We'll meet back at the bar.
- Yep. All right, thanks, Gil.
All right.
- Hey, kid.
- Yeah?
You ready to come back to society?
Thanks.
Heather...
if you're alive, I'll find you.
- Poor lady.
- Amy?
But we can't have another Amy, okay?
I'm a mom, I know exactly how she feels.
I'm starting to think that this thing's
tracking everybody that either has a child
on the police force or knows
somebody in the police force.
It's tracking the whole town.
And that's all that's happening.
We gotta put an end to it.
Donny's gotta be the last kid.
Well, there's only one way
to find anything out.
- What?
- With this Golden Boy.
- Hey, guys, how's it going?
- Look at you, I remember you.
- That's the Jeremy I remember.
- It's good to be back.
- It's good to have you back
- Yeah, thanks, man.
Hey, let me get you a drink.
- What would you like?
- Whisky on the rocks.
Thanks, Monk. Come on, sit down.
- Hey, where's Gil?
- Oh, he dropped me off at the hotel
and, uh, had to go back and talk
to the woman with the missing kid.
Ah, that poor lady.
We were just talking about that.
Hey, Jeremy, listen to me.
Seriously, I am sorry for bringing you
back under these circumstances.
Yeah.
Man, this place brings back memories.
What made you sell this place, Harry?
Assholes. Dealing with drunken assholes.
You been gone for five years.
A lot's changed.
The place has turned to shit.
The whole town.
Crime is the business at hand now.
So, uh, Gil asked if I could come back
and give him a hand.
I know the community, I know the people,
and, you know, how to deal with it.
- And we got a missing kid problem.
- Yep.
- Yeah.
- You can't catch him,
and if you do, look what happens.
Look what happened to my family.
- Jeremy, Jeremy, I, uh...
- You can't kill him, Harry.
This is what he does.
This is what he's always done.
And then he does it all again.
Jeremy, I understand you're frustrated.
I really do.
What if we catch him?
Like really catch him and contain him
so he can't do this anymore,
just... it'll make it all stop.
I don't know, maybe.
We can't give up, all right? We can't.
It's happening sooner. There's never
been reoccurrences like this in the past.
It's way more erratic,
and he's taking way more children.
All right, do you guys have any idea why?
We got some theories.
Maybe, uh, his powers are dwindling.
Maybe he's dying, he's reaching.
- What about this?
- Where'd you get that?
This... this. Is she still alive?
Jeremy, we never found
anything from your daughter.
Anything.
We found a body part from every
other missing child, except her.
Jeremy! Go talk to him.
Jeremy.
Hey.
Don't give up.
My son, he's dead and buried,
but your daughter,
she could still be out there.
So don't give up.
The lambs will lead
themselves to slaughter.
Look what we have here.
I can't believe they're actually here.
You know, this looks almost too easy.
Natasha, stay here.
You're joking.
Stuart was pretty adamant
about us being on point here.
You would not believe the maintenance
of it versus fresh water aquariums.
Guy who finally could totally relate
to my farting turtles,
and I just knew that you are my, uh...
uh, okay.
- Fuck you.
- Going for a ride, boy!
- Tough guy, huh?
- Shut up.
What the fuck's going on now?
Got him on possession,
got him on assault...
Enough, get him in the fucking car!
Get him in the fucking car!
Oh, you guys are so tough.
Man, five years.
Come back for one day and that fucking
Brian Hatt guy comes back to haunt me.
- Where'd Lori go?
- I think she went to the bathroom, I...
Nah, she never came back in.
She must've jumped in with Gil.
Oh, hey, when you tackled that shithead...
he dropped his keys.
Let's finish these up and go check
his car out, see what we can find.
- Salut.
- Nostrovia.
Freeze!
You fucking bitch!
Smells like bacon.
Fuck you!
Your nipples are hard.
Enough!
Are you okay?
No.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Go ahead, bitch.
My mama always told me
to fuck what you kill.
Lucky for you...
I only like blondes.
Let's go, Miss Piggy.
This is it.
Left his cellphone.
Take him to the Kelly house?
I know where that is, man.
It's like two hours away.
I'll call the Captain.
Gil, it's Jeremy.
Hey, that guy you just took in?
He left his keys there.
We found a cellphone.
Said take him to, to the Kelly house?
You know where that is?
Yeah.
No, I thought she was with you.
All right, we gotta get out there.
How long will it take you to get ready?
Mm, two hours is too long,
we need to go right now.
All right, see you there.
- All right, let's go, man, jump in.
- Let's go.
- Fuck!
- What's up, boss?
Trevor is in jail and Natasha's MIA.
What about TJ?
Baby, where are you? You all right?
Okay, good. Yes, I know.
You did? Really?
Very cool. You bet.
Okay, see you in a minute.
That was Natasha, she's on
her way here with a lady cop.
- Well?
- We went in to get Jeremy and...
- And did you?
- No.
No, that's right, you didn't.
And where is Trevor?
Well, some bigass mountain dude
came barreling at me.
That's not what I asked you.
Trevor is in jail,
and I was lucky to get away.
Right, right. You must be tired.
Please, take a seat.
- Where is she?
- In the car.
- Secure?
- She ain't going anywhere.
Please, have a seat.
What do you want me to do, boss?
So, let me get this straight.
We finally get a lead to Jeremy Duffin,
the man who murdered my brother.
I send who I thought
were the best men for the job,
- but obviously I was mistaken.
- Boss, I can...
You pathetic piece of shit,
you left Natasha!
- Let me explain.
- I had one request, do you remember?
- Yes.
- I asked you to look after her, TJ!
- One simple, little request!
- I... can, I...
I, I, I! I, you scumbag motherfucker!
You didn't know
it didn't have one in the pipe?
Well, Rick, I didn't!
- Jesus Christ!
- I need new men.
No man has ever left me but my dead Mama.
Fuck! Baby, where the hell
you think you're going?
The girl, in the car.
All right then.
Grab your gear. We're taking a ride.
I've got a feeling we'll get to see
my brother's killer tonight.
Is everything okay?
I can't believe this is real.
I just can't wrap my head around this.
Wish you didn't have to.
This is not where we're gonna find Lori.
This is where we're gonna
find your monster.
Oh, my God.
- What?
- Shh, I'll be back.
<i>Heather.</i>
<i>If you're alive, I'll find you.</i>
Heather.
<i>Isn't our daughter beautiful?</i>
I should leave his ass out here to freeze,
but that'd be too fucking easy.
Cut him down and bring his ass inside.
You go get the pork chops in the car.
Hey, Jeremy.
You busy?
How's it hanging?
Oh, Jesus. Oh.
One of your friends?
Oh, Monk.
Don't worry.
You look so much better than him.
What do you say we get you down, huh?
- Do you remember a Brian Hatt?
- Yeah, he's a piece of shit.
He died five years ago today!
And guess what? His little brother's
here to celebrate the anniversary.
- You fucking kill me. Go ahead, kill me.
- Oh, we will.
First...
we play. Let's go!
- The cabin's that way.
- You know what?
You've been naughty.
Shut up!
Come on! I don't have all day.
Let's go, that way!
Let's go! Come on!
Faster!
They got 'em.
Yeah, Lori, too.
Who?
Stuart Hatt and his whole crew.
Shit!
Okay, gather up, gather,
here's what we're gonna do.
- Sweep up around this side of their house.
- Got ya, boss.
Should I call for back-up?
- What?
- Just go around that side.
- Busting my fucking balls.
- Just shut up and go. Go.
Christmas has come early this year.
This'll do fine.
That's some Rambo shit right there.
Take his shirt off. I wanna finish this
while it's still my brother's anniversary.
What's that?
Man, you into some crazy shit.
Number eight? You a NASCAR fan?
Well, gentlemen,
start your motherfucking engines!
So I'm curious.
Is this your new girlfriend?
Get off her and let's get on with this.
- We've got company.
- Who?
Lock and load, boys,
it's time to rock and roll!
This party's just beginning.
Baby.
You.
You all right, son?
Looks like all hell brook loose in here.
They left you to tell the story.
Why? Why me?
They're all fucking dead. All of 'em.
Well, we can't do anything about that now.
It's almost Christmas Eve.
But I'm feeling awful gracious this year.
I think I'm gonna grant you
a wish for Christmas.
So what's your wish, Jeremy,
for Christmas this year?
I just want all the pain to stop,
all the killing.
I just want a normal life.
Well, I hope you've been
a very good boy, Jeremy,
'cause that's a very tall order.
Remember what you did
to that little girl Julie?
- Come on, think about it, you remember.
- What?
Oh, no, no.
<i>He sees you when you're sleeping</i>
<i>He knows when you're awake</i>
<i>He knows if you've been bad or good</i>
Yeah, you get the picture, don't you?
Please forgive me.
I've never been able to...
That little girl, her mother...
her mother and I, well, let's just say...
we were pretty close.
Jeremy, that little girl you killed...
that was my daughter.
Her mother's never been able
to forgive herself.
She died, she overdosed on pills, Jeremy.
That was my family, mine!
It's a good thing
I'm not a vengeful person.
Doesn't go well with the job,
you know what I mean?
Hmm, and my brother,
I leave that up to him.
He knows vengeance.
- Krampus?
- Aw, now you're catching on, Jeremy.
Ah, you motherfucker, all these people,
they all trust you, they believe in you.
You ever wonder how one person
could have so much bad luck.
Just when you think
it's getting worse, it gets worse,
and you fall into one bucket
of shit after another.
- Do you ever think about that, Jeremy?
- You son of a bitch.
All these people had their faith in you
all these years, believing in you.
- You piece of shit!
- You think I wanted any of this shit?
You mortals make up fairy tales about me
to justify your own miserable existence.
I am no measure of my actions!
I'm a fucking god!
You think of me as how you want me
to be, not as who I actually am!
And you dare question my actions.
You are no god! You're as bad as
the kids you and your brother punish.
Watch what you say, Jeremy.
You can't do anything to me anymore.
You did your worst
when you took my wife and daughter.
There's nothing left to take any more,
you've taken it all.
Christmas is about giving, Jeremy.
You haven't received your present yet.
You want your family back?
Hell, you already had your daughter.
Remember? Think about it.
You understand this sign there?
It's not an eight, dumbass.
It's infinity.
Infinity.
Means forever and ever.
That torture of yours
is gonna last forever.
It was real?
Yeah, just think about it.
You're gonna be a grandfather
and a father. That's a hell of a feat.
Reminds me of some of those families
I deal with down south.
Who says there's no Christmas miracles?
Hey, Santa!
Fuck you!
Really, Jeremy?
You really think that's gonna work?
I didn't think so.
Yeah, well, this will.
Have a merry Christmas.
See ya soon, Jeremy.
Very soon.
