He's here.
- Carl.
- Martin, Mr. Hale, it's an honor.
When I was a kid, I saved
that Time magazine cover.
The man who built New York.
You're the reason I got
into this business.
Sit please, and uh, congratulations
on the downtown contract.
Thank you, I didn't know
the word was out yet.
Hard to keep the word in on a 200
million dollar deal like that.
I hear you lobbied councilman
Clark pretty hard.
Just a few steak
dinners, that's all.
I'm not talking about the Kobe.
Look Martin.
You called the Hale
Group a relic.
I'm not sure if those
were my exact words.
No, your exact words were ..
The old man won't
be around for long.
At least that's how the
councilman remembers it.
You're getting the
contract aren't you?
I don't want a contract.
You think 200 million
dollars means you
arrived? What I want is
to offer you a lesson.
From an old man, free of charge.
We've spoken with
Simon and Cowen.
Between them they control
7 seats on your board.
And they support me.
You've come to see the need for someone
with the wisdom of experience.
And someone who might
remember that councilman.
Clark's first campaign
30 years ago.
Was bankrolled by Mr. Hale here.
Try and appreciate the irony Mr.
Baldwin.
You say I'm the reason you
get into this business?
Now I'm the reason you're out.
You son of a bitch. You're gonna be dead
in a year and then who gives a shit?
He's wrong.
I wont last 6 months, its
metastasized, liver and lungs.
This morning the oncologists
were talking about hospice care.
Sorry.
Don't be.
What you and Judith went through
losing a child. That's a tragedy.
An old man dying, I'm
supposed to say, that's life.
Still feels like a
kick in the nuts.
You told Claire?
I haven't had a chance, Well ..
She won't return my calls.
Jesus Damian, if only she knew.
She has every
reason to be angry.
Whoa. Peanuts.
I'll send.. I'll send it back.
Cancer's eating me alive, I'm
worried about allergies!
Maybe I order a .. PB & J?
Haha. No.
You know I wanted to
tear all this down?
In the 70s replace it with condos.
And now? I coulndn't if I tried.
Mayor declared it a Landmark.
Martin, you ever hear about
something called shedding?
Shedding, you mean like a snake?
Ah it's nothing, forget about it.
It's something I was reading about
I am looking for
something to read.
Hi you've reached Claire,
please leave a message.
How many?
Before me? Less than a dozen.
Shedding is an
exclusive endeavor.
You mean expensive
Doctor Albright.
Well our clients are wealthy but
that's not how they're chosen.
We keep it to the great, the
visionaries whose loss would be a
blow to all of us. Simply put, we
offer humanity's greatest minds.
More time to fulfill
their potential.
If you think about it.
Your homes, your yacht, your jet.
All custom built by the
worlds finest craftsmen, and so
will your new body be as well.
Genetically engineered for
perfection, harvested to maturity
so looks, athletism, every
detail of your new anatomy.
Were designed to offer you the
very best of the human experience.
- A reflex.
- It's alive?
Well in the most basic sense, a bundle
of organic tissue, but right now.
An empty vessel.
If you can really
do what you say.
Then why the makeshift lab,
I mean why all the secrecy?
You're asking the
wrong question.
Oh, what's the right question?
You built an empire.
From the ground up.
But every day, to create
something from nothing, now.
As you slip away.
People will call your
work your legacy.
They'll insist that your buildings
somehow make you immortal.
What's your point?
Do you feel immortal?
Hey come on guys.
Remember we want everyone at
the rally to be respectful.
We're trying to win people over.
Dad.
Aren't you gonna introduce me?
Sorry, to show up like this. It's the
only place I knew I could find you.
Well, I'm kinda in the
middle of something.
Let's take a ride uptown to that place by
Macy's, you used to love their sundae's.
Yeah, when I was 8.
Is something wrong.
- You don't look well.
- I'm fine.
Now, please take a ride with me.
Look, it's just bad time ok?
Maybe we could meet up later.
Not later.
The revolution can wait Claire.
I don't get you.
Months go by, years even.
I'm at work, Dad.
This isn't work.
It's a bunch of children
throwing a tantrum.
Look, I didn't come
here to do this again.
I came because I want
to make things right.
What does that mean?
I know you're short on funds.
How .. Just take it. You know you can
really be a manipulative asshole.
Don't be a fool, Claire,
I'm trying here.
No, you're not, you're
doing what you always do.
Showing up on your terms, expecting
your checkbook to solve everything.
I'm talking about a future.
Where the aged man can
shed their prison.
A future where.
The faith of a healthy mind.
Is not determined by the
faith of a failing body.
Ok.
Oh my goodness.
Albright.
I don't.
Feel .. Immortal.
If we do this, there's no turning
back, your old life is over.
You see someone from your past, you
walk away. Is that clear Mr. Hale?
You have your conditions,
I have mine.
You get paid after the procedure, I
maybe dying, but I'm not a fool.
Settle your affairs and fly
to New Orleans on Tuesday.
Your death needs to be public Mr.
Hale.
Have lunch at Commanders. I
recommend the chicory coffee.
You've reached the residence of Martin
and Judy, please leave a message.
Sorry to bother you with
at the ranch Martin.
You mind meeting me for lunch?
In New Orleans.
Are you going to stay?
George wants you to.
The Hale Group, without Hale.
No.
Thank you.
Judith's been spending most of her
time at the coast at the ranch.
I think it's time
for me to cash out.
Join her full time.
I wish you could drive out.
Come to the new place.
If the maids(?).. stopped quitting.. we
might finally be ready for visitors.
Damian are you okay?
.. What's the matter?
- I ..
- What?
Wha? Da-!
Call 911!
Damian!
Do you have your epipen?! Do you
have it with you?! He can't breathe!
ETA 5 minutes.
Mr. Hale? Mr. Hale, the good
news is you are not going
into anaphylactic shock, you
just feel like you are.
The bad news is, your body needs to arrive
DOA at Tulane Hospital in about 20 minutes.
Open your mouth please.
Have all your fillings been removed? Have
all your metal fillings been removed?
Yeah!
The machine is a giant magnet.
Any metal will
disrupt the process.
So you're sure you're
not missing anything?
Good.
What's that?
Something to stop your heart.
What?!
I said, it's something
to stop your heart.
It.. It hurt.
What's your name?
Didn't work.
What's your name?
My name is Damian.
Damian.
It will take a few days,
but it gets easier.
How's that.. new body smell?
Now you have a new body.
Damian.
Ya?
- Are you alright?
- Yes.
Death has some side effects.
Here.
Your paper of record.
You can arrange a
visit to the plot.
In a few months if it
holds any significance.
But.
Right now.
Get some rest if you can.
Tomorrow's your first
day of school.
So ..
How are you feeling?
Terrific, I have the physical
dexterity of a toddler.
250 million well spent.
Sense of humor. Good.
It's important, actually. Helps to um..
Fend off despair.
Is that why I'm only
allowed plastic knives?
Well, suicidal thoughts
are not uncommon.
And handling the body and
mind of an alien can be..
Pretty overwhelming.
And what is that?
- Prozak?
- No, not exactly, no.
The glitches that you
described to me.
That's your mind adjusting
to its new neural structure.
And you can expect
occassional mild
hallucinations for the
first few sessions(?)
Well that's not that bad.
Think of it as ..
The anti-rejection drug that
you take after any transplant.
And what does
rejection look like?
Well, migraine, nausea,
disorientation and then.
- Well, death..
- Oh..
Is that all?
An irrelevant hypothetical.
- One a day for the time being.
- Hell yes.
I was born on
September 20th, 1980.
Phoenix, Arizona.
My parents, and my older sister
were killed in a car crash.
My parents, and my older sister were killed
in a car crash when I was ten years old.
I was home with a stomach ache because I'd
snuck in the kitchen and ate a whole..
..I was born in September
20th September 1980.
. I was born in
September 20th, 1980 ..
Parents and my older
sister were killed in a
car crash, I was home
with a stomach ache.
I'd snuck in the kitchen and ate
a whole of chocolate icecream.
I haven't eaten chocolate since.
My uncle Frank raised
me in Chicago.
I went to Northwestern, where I
majored in computer science.
I have never married.
I have no children, I
have never married.
I have no children. My name is Edward
Kidner, Edward Kidner, my name, my name ..
My name is Edward Kidner.
What's this?
This is a graduation present.
I would like for the time being
just until you catch your bearings.
We've arranged the house
and car for you, placed
the money that you put aside
in your bank account.
- Not many in there, are there?
- Seven.
You'll get refills at
our weekly meetings.
No.
This wasn't part of the deal.
I'm sorry, I admit
it's inconvenient.
But with so few undergoing
the procedure, everyone of..
Our patients is a learning process.
It's just for now, alright?
And how do I get
in touch with you?
You don't. I come to you.
My privacy is very important
to me for obvious reasons.
Fair enough.
I'll tell you what, in a couple
of months, we can talk about
wherever it is that you want
to be relocated, alright?
But in the meantime, why don't
you just relax and have fun?
Afterall, at your age, I'd
say you've earned it.
Hey, NBA.
You see any scouts watching?
- Huh? I like to win.
- Hoo.
Come back, you'll
be disappointed.
You're not from
around here, are you?
How do you guess?
The locals prefer sucking?
I like that. That's funny.
You'll get a local ass whooping.
I'm Anton.
Edward.
How's the wrist?
My kids could dish
out more than that.
- You got kids?
- Yeah buddy.
Let me show you my beauties.
Look at that, the oldest ..
She just turned seven - well,
they're cute at that age.
Well they wear claws and
sharp pointed teeth.
So what's your story, Eddy?
What do you mean?
You know, you're new in
town, catch some jazz..
Chase the ladies?
No no no. I'm actually running a car
pool about two blocks up there.
No shit? We just
around the corner.
Oh yeah? No shit.
Yeah, I'm right here.
Anton, it was nice to meet you.
Sure.
Hey, I'm gonna take you out.
Sort of like a little welcome
to the neighborhood?
I appreciate that, but you got..
You got kids at home.
Yeah, but they live with their mother.
I get to
see them like once a
month, you know how it is?
Come on, you rather drink alone?
No, no I wouldn't. You're on.
- Are you in line? Thanks.
- After you.
Eddie..
What's going on?
How are you. I'm Edward.
- Hi.
- Leah.
- Leah, nice to meet you.
- This is Andrea.
Andrea, pleasure. Very nice
taste in friends Anton.
- Well done.
- Thank you very much.
Oh, now. What were we talking about?
They were asking me what you do.
- Besides trying to play ball.
- Nothing.
I'm retired.
How old are you?
I was born in September 28,
1980 in Phoenix, Arizona.
That's specific.
Specific.
Very specific. Actually, I started
a company and then I sold..
Are they giving some away in there?
Nevermind.
- I love this song.
- I love this song.
She's.. She's incredible.
- She's a guy, isn't she?
- Yeah.
- Are you ok?
- I am..
I'm fine.. just haven't..
Seen anything like
that in my 52 years.
You're weird.
Where are you going?
- Hello? - Hello, Claire?
- Yes. Who's there?
Hello?
Who is this?
I see this little girl. She
uh can't be more than 5 or 6.
And uh .. Somehow I know that ..
She's the daughter
of this woman.
Something wrong, she's sick.
She's expecting me to help her.
Well, you mentioned that you
missed taking your medication.
Once. Just one. Yes.
Well, that would account for the
intensity of your hallucination.
Oh, no this wasn't a hallucination.
I knew her.
Oh, yes, I understand it
might seem that way given
your unresolved feelings for
your own daughter, but ..
What you're experiencing
is simply a confused
composite of old memories fueled
by your own very real emotions.
Now for example, this town with the water
tower at the pumpkin pens(?) on it.
It's likely some place
you've visited as a child.
And this Latina woman. Well.
Well, a one night stand
long since forgotten..
How do you know she's Latina?
Hmm?
I never said she was Latina.
Hmm.
Here.
What is this?
Hawaii.
Change of scenery.
Yes, I'm afraid I've uh..
Kept you cooped up in here far too
long and I'm sorry about that.
But for the week
that you're gone.
I'm doubling your
dose of medication.
Now you remember to take
it and I assure these
unpleasant episodes will
soon be behind you.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright

- Good morning, sir. May I?
- Thank you.
Erick.
Come on.
- Hey - Hi, how can I help you?
- Change of
plans. When is the next flight to St.
Louis?
St. Louis..
Destination, 200
yards on the left.
Destination, 100
yards on the left.
Hello?

Put it down and get out now.
If you're looking for insurance
money, you're not gonna find any.
I don't want your money.
What?
I'm gonna turn around now.
Please don't move.
Please just take a deep breath.
I'm gonna turn around, okay?
Please try to
relax, take your finger
off the trigger, okay?
Is that you..
Please take your finger
off the trigger.
It's okay.
It's okay. Hey.
Oh my God. How is this possible?
Take a deep breath.
Put the gun down.
Take a deep breath.
How is this possible?
I'm sorry, I've been
meaning to talk to you(?).
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, just try
to take a breath.
What, what ..
It's you.
It's alright, it's
alright, it's alright.
- How could it be?
- I don't know.
Eddie.
Hey, hey, wait, are you
expecting somebody?
Did you bring somebody back
to the house with you?
No.
No, what are you talking about?
No, what ..
Are you expecting
someone while ..
- Skinner.
- What are you ..
Okay, ssh, ssh, hold your peace.
Hold on, Mark. What do you ..
Skinner.
Skinner.
Open the door please?
Skinner. Can you open the door?
Wah.
Skinner, put your gun down.
Okay? We're just here
to help you, you know.
Hands down! Hands
down, motherfucker!
Calm down!
- Let me go!
- Calm down only!
Eddie.
Hey, it's okay man.. let him go.
Deliver him.
Get off me.
You work for Albright?
I'm still your friend.
Albright, me, we just
want what's best for you.
This woman thinks
her husband's dead.
They told me the body
was grown in the lab.
Why don't you sit down?
Please?
That was his choice.
It was the only way to
save his kid's life.
You gave money?
C'mon, man. The insurance
wouldn't step up, so.
We took care of things.
It was the only way to get the
little girl back to her feet again.
You shouldn't come here, Eddie.
This doesn't concern you.
Like hell it doesn't, this ..
- You took a man's life.
- Hey, nobody..
Took anything.
You're a businessman, right?
You understand that.
The kid, Anna, she's
alive thanks to you.
That's bullshit, I ..
I could've, I could've
cut that guy a check.
Really?
But would you have?
Eddie, I get that
you're disappointed.
You thought you were buying a
new car and it turns out..
That it had a few miles on it.
How could you be so glib
like nothing happened?
Few miles, huh?
You know, the..
The doc says, each patient
is critical to the program.
Yeah, fuck him.
You don't exist without us.
You took a leap without a net.
Do you really believe
that, Anton?
I warned you.
You know who I used to be.
You like to win.
You're gonna be
very disappointed.
There's a car outside, I
suggest you get in it.
The woman?
She's not your problem.
It will look like an accident.
- You okay?
- Just take the medicine.
Just relax, I'm gonna
use the bathroom.
That's enough.
Hey, Gary?
No! Put the gun down!
Put that down! Put that down.
He shot me!
The doct wants him alive, ok?
Go to the front.
Go on the front.
Hey, Eddie.
Eddie, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Eddie?
Don't shoot, man.
Eddie, I'll put my gun down.
I'm not trying to hurt you.
I'm gonna come in.
I'm coming in, it's just me, I'm
gonna show you my hands, alright?
Touching the knob.
Look, look.
Do not shoot.
Eddie.
See Look, look.
You didn't have to do that,
we were on the same team.
Shoot him!
Light him up!
To be!
- Huh?
- Wake up, wake up!
Damian!
We gonna burn you!
Burn them up!
Can't we just talk?
Wait.
Where are you .. stop!
Madeline, not now.
Madeline? What
happened to Maddy?
I don't feel well, we
gotta keep moving.
But you were just dead.
They told me you drowned.
What happened, Mike. We
need to call the police!
No! No, no, police.
I ..
I made a deal for Anna.
Disappearing is part of it.
Why?
In exchange for the
money, I, I ..
I, I agreed to do things, things
only a dead man can get away with.
Okay? We gotta keep moving.
Let's go, come on.
What?
No, you bastard! How
could you do that to me?
Stop.
No, I thought you were dead!
Hey, hey, Maddy! Hey!
I didn't want you to have
to make that choice.
At least I don't think I did between your..
Your husband and or your daughter.
Okay?
Okay.
You bastard.
I thought you were dead.
Oh my God.
- Anna.
- Anna?
Anna's in school, Mark.
Mark!

I hope she's strong
enough to blow them out.
♪ ♪ Happy Birthday ..
Whoo!
You can do it pumpkin.
Do you make a wish pumpkin?
I wished for daddy to
teach me how to swim.
You're not supposed to say.
And we all know the truth.
Hey, that's not nice.
Is that true?
No, pumpkin. Of course not. I will
teach you as soon as you get better.
Shit!
Daddy!
I knew it, I knew it, I
knew it, I knew it ..
Uh.
Momma's crying every night
and I told her not to worry.
I told her you'd come back.
I love you, Daddy.
I love you too, pumpkin.
Okay hey.
Time to go, c'mon.
Daddy, - Hey, get in
here and spit it out.
You don't talk to him
with your mouth full.
Daddy.
- What? Yes? Sweety?
- Do you like my hair?
What?
Do you like my hair?
They grew longer.
It's beautiful.
Come on, go get ready for bed.
What's with all
these nice clothes?
They made me remove it.
Listen, tomorrow morning,
you and uh, Anna.
Is there a place that I can take
you, a friend's house, or ..
Do you, do you think I'm
letting my eyes off..
Mark.
What are you looking for?
- Shit!
- Mark!
Sorry.
Just need to go out
for some fresh air.
Come on.
This guy.
I'm talking about a future.
Where the age in time (??)
Can shed their prison(??).
A future, where the fate
of a healthy mind..
That's good.
Failing body.
Now, Professor Jensen.
Do you really think
that the old people..
This guy.
Martin.
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm fine?
You're on the ground.
I know. I'm fine...
Do you need a doctor?
No.
It's over. It's over.
What's over?
Nothing... Martin.
Please, talk to me.
What's going on?
I'm sorry.
So sorry.
I know you don't have any reason to
but you have to trust me right now.
Okay?
Just...
Where are we running to?
We'll need to get medicine.
I'll make a stop in New Orleans.
Daddy.
Daddy?
You... You need to
go to the bathroom?
- Mm-mmm.
- No?
Are you feeling sick?
No.
Of course not. No why?
Then why are we going
to the doctor?
Is it for me again?
Oh.
No sweetie, it's not for you.
We're going to see the doctor's wife.
Daddy needs to talk to her.
Are you okay?
Go back to sleep, alright?
Okay.
Mrs. Jensen will see you now.
Thank you.
Upstairs.
- Hi, Mrs. Jensen.
- Come in.
Thank you. I'm sorry
to bother you...
No. You're not. Please.
I am a student of your husband.
Oh..
- You're a student.
- I was, yeah.
- A student.
- Uh, Mrs Jensen, I'm um...
Uh... I was wondering if I could get
access to your husband's research.
I'm trying to follow
up on that work.
That's wonderful that
You would follow up.
Because that's what I told them.
I said follow up. Of course.
Follow up!
But the university act like
he never even existed. They..
Put his research into boxes...
Box? Boxed his research? Is
that stored somewhere? Is it..
Is there.. Is there any.. any way
that I could maybe get to it?
Did Francis ever
tell you how we met?
- No.
- He was such a romantic.
Now, you and the other one,
you're both so handsome.
He was another. Well, I
think he's a doctor now.
He comes every Wednesday and brings
my favorite butter scotch candy.
His name is Albright.
- Maybe I have some...
- Mrs. Jensen. Hey.
Mrs Jensen. Hey. Look at me.
Do you know where I
can find Albright?
No.
Please. Think.
No. Of course not.
But his number is right
by the telephone.
Phyllis.
Alright, Phyllis.
I'll be right over.
Now Phyllis dear,
what was all this..
Close the door.
Did you hurt her?
The wife? No.
She's fine.
Now close the door.
I need pills. Enough to last.
You shouldn't have come here.
You shouldn't have lied to me.
I gave you what you wanted.
I never wanted others to suffer.
I'm trying to ease suffering.
Just think of all the great
minds of this world has lost.
Simply because..
Their bodies were failing.
Edison, Einstein, Steve Jobs...
They asked what he could've accomplished
with another 50 years on this planet.
My wife...
My wife was an incredibly
kind and decent woman.
And she could still
be on my side, but..
Thanks to the Alzheimer's,
there's no mind left to salvage.
And that's it? That's your
bullshit paper-thin excuse?
That's why you justify murder?
How do you do justify
taking the pills?
Hmm?
What do you think they do?
No?
Stop taking the
medication, and..
Your mind fades into oblivion.
Madeline can have
her husband back.
But.. keep going. Push on.
And each dose that you take
erases a little more of Mark.
His army training,
his instincts.
After a year or so,
they'll be gone forever.
You never asked the right
questions, Damian.
What do you want to do now
to have all the answers.
Let's go to the lab.
Hey, pop!
- Easy.
- Sshhh.
Don't fear. Take him to the car.
I need a word with Mrs. Jensen.
Easy, friend.
Come on.
What's he doing here?
Pop the trunk.
Martin, is everything okay?
Stop it.
I said, stop it!
Let him go!
Damn it.
Anton?
First time I take it for a
spin, you get a scratch on it.
That takes weeks.
First one's the hardest.
After a few sheddings, back
on your feet in no time.
The pills, give me your pills.
You didn't even tell her.
Shutup.
- Why don't you ask your husband.
- Shutup.
When your daughter's
birthday is.
And when you two lovebirds..
What is he talking about?
- Mark, what's going on?
- Come on.
- Up here and pull over.
- No. No.
I said pull over!
Get out.
Stay here, pumpkin, okay?
Daddy and mommy need a minute.
Okay.
So when's Anna's birthday?
Can you answer that?
The hotel where we got married?
Anything?!
What I'm about to
tell you is, uh...
Is not gonna sound
very reasonable.
I don't know!
- What do you mean?
- I didn't know!
What do you mean you don't know?
I didn't know.
- How do you not know?
- I had no idea.
Mom, are you okay?
I'm okay honey, alright?
Daddy just forgot my birthday.
Will you go back inside honey?
Just wait in the car for me?
- Can daddy come with me?
- No!
Alright. Look. Daddy's not feeling well,
if you need anything you ask mommy, okay?
Alright? You know what, why don't
you go play in the horsie?
So what?
I mean.. what do I.. I call you?
Who are you?
My name is Damian.
I'm so sorry.
I want to help you.
You help me? Oh, really?
- You want to help me? Huh?
- Yes.
Why don't you start off by
bringing back my husband?
Okay, because the only help that
I need is to tell a 6 year old..
And explain to her that the man who
looks and sounds like her father isn't!
How am I supposed to go
through it all over again?
I don't know.
I do know that if push me away you
won't survive, they'll kill you both.
You manipulative asshole.
I know.
I've heard that before.
Look, if there's one
thing that I understand
in life, it's the bottom line...
And these people, I
know how they think.
They built something. They
won't let it go. They
will spend whatever they
need to or eliminate.
Whomever they have to.
They'll just keep coming.
Now, I'm not asking you to understand
all this. But I am asking you..
To grab your daughter
and get in the car.
I could take you someplace.
Safe, where you can start over.
My friend has a plane and he
can get us out of the country.
There's an account in Geneva. It's
untraceable, with more than enough money.
And Anna. She can't
know the truth.
When it's over, I'm
gonna disappear.
You tell her whatever
you want to.
- Hello?
- Mr. O'Neil?
- Yes?
- I have a message from Damian Hale.
I think you'll wanna hear it.
I saw him die with my own eyes.
You saw what they wanted you to.
And this woman, you're
gonna tell me she's uh...
My great grandmother?
She's just a friend, Martin.
Somebody I need to help now.
What you're claiming
is simply impossible.
You remember in New York when
I asked you about shedding?
What? I have never met you!
It's me, Damian.
I don't know what kind of con
you're running, but I'm not biting.
That's it, I'm
calling the police.
Anna.
We need to go, pumpkin.
Judith, please put
the telephone down.
I starting to understand why
your maids keep quitting.
Where? Where did you get this?
What is it?
It was a deed to 144
Plimpton Street.
The first building we
ever bought together.
Do you remember that night
we signed the papers?
We went to Charlie's kitchen.
There's a brunette sitting in the corner.
I want to talk to her.
She's been staring
at me all night.
But you stop me.
You already closed
one deal tonight.
- Don't get greedy.
- Don't get greedy.
Turns out she's the dean's
17 year old daughter.
How'd you know to
put this aside?
It's me, Martin.
We never do anything
without insurance.
Damian.
It's stunned(?), but it
could take some time
to gas up the plane,
file a flight plan.
Thank you, Martin.
It's March 22nd.
Mom's birthday.
- Try to remember next time.
- Yeah.
You know, all this
will be over soon.
This running around.. and you
can have a new house and...
New school, new friends...
A new school uniform.
Would you like that?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?
How's the water feel?
About room temperature.
Really?
Room temperature.
I never got around to
teaching you, did I?
You left before I got better.
But you're feeling
better now, aren't you?
Want to come this way?
You know how hard it is to
swim with those on your feet?
There you go.
They make me look
like a chicken.
We're gonna kick hard..
Kick hard. Kick hard.
Look out Olympics
2020 right here.
And she's on her own.
When did you start
professionally whistling?
When did you go on tour?
Yes, you can. Kick,
kick, kick, kick.
I didn't go on tour. I was
just walking to my room.
I really wanted to
know how to whistle.
Come on. Come on. Come on. YaY-
So then I started off like this.
As fast as you can. That's good.
Kicking me in the face.
That'll do.
Go go go go go! You're not old yet, when
you get old, that's when you get scared.
And then it started like this.
And then like this.
And you're whistling.
I love you, daddy.
Slow down, okay.
- Do you need help, baby?
- I'm not a baby.
Are you okay?
Just, just let me listen to it.
You.. you okay?
Well, you're not a bad kisser.
Another way of saying mediocre.
That's not what I meant.
I know.
- I know. I know.
- Come on, I just...
I want to know who you were.
I just need something.
Anything. To remind me that
you're not my husband.
For starters, you should be
thankful that I'm not your husband.
I wasn't much of
a father either.
You had children?
I do, I have one. I
have a girl, Claire.
And?
When she was little, I wasn't..
Uh around much.
When she was big, I
was never around.
She turned out okay though.
She runs a non profit now.
That's something to be proud of.
Depends who you ask.
Is she good at what she does?
She's great.
She's really great.
Did you ever tell her that?
Do you know where you'll go?
With uh Anna?
I've never really
been anywhere before.
Okay.
I mean, yeah, Mark and I
used to fantasize about.
Hiding away in some
Carribean island somewhere.
Sure.
- Turquoise water.
- Hello?
- White sand beaches.
- This money.
You'll be able to do that.
And then some.
Yeah, I guess.
I guess i just never
imagined going without him.
No. Imagine that.
- What is that?
- It's nothing.
I'll be right back.
Hello?
Hello?
- Where's Anna?
- What's the matter?
Is everything okay?
Anna?
Anna?
Anna? Anna?
Oh, man. I just pulled
on inside the road.
I'm winning. Yes!
Who's this pumpkin?
This is Tommy. He lives here.
Anna, it's time to go. Say goodbye
to your friend. Come on. Let's go.
What's the matter?
- It's Martin and Judith's son.
- So?
He died two years ago.
- Who died?
- Nobody.
Anna.
Mommy?
Mommy!
Put the gun down,
you'll hurt someone.
Take Tony out to our room.
How much time do we have?
- What?
- How much time do we have?
You have to understand
I owe them everything!
How much time do we have?!
Martin.
The minute you step
off the property.
They called an hour
before you got here.
How can you do that to a child?
- What?
- We saved his life,
You wouldn't have done the
same for your daughter?
- Mommy!
- No, not like that.
One day, he won't even remember
what he used to look like..
I'm coming, Tony, I'm coming.
That he was ever
sick to begin with.
What about the other family?
What other family?
Yeah, I didn't know.
How do you not know where
a body comes from?
A lab!
Genetically engineered ..
Grown in a test tube.
That's somebody else's
son up there, Martin.
A son they thought they buried.
No.
Oh, God damnit.
The garage I can get
to it from the inside?
Okay.
You're gonna.. you're
gonna take Anna.
You have to (??) the highway...
Wait, wait, what..
And you don't stop. Are
you listening to me?
And what are you going to do?
I'm gonna buy you some time.
You got a car that I can use?
Take the SUV, the
windows are tinted.
I'll take them through the woods,
there's a path. I'll show you.
Go. He's gonna help you.
What? Mark? Why do
we trust him now?
- We don't have a choice?
- What? Mark?
We don't have a choice, go!
There's a truck stop off 180. If you
make it, we'll be there til midnight.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
They're heading your way.
Got a visual.
He's alone. There's
noone in the car.
I'll check the
back of the house.
- There's a car!
- What?
No! No Wait!
Wait!
Stop!
- Anna! No!
- Mommy!
No! No! No! No! No! Anna!
Anna!
- Where are they, Martin?
- I fell ..
- I fell behind.
- Where are they?
She (??).. To flag down a ride
and they ran right into them.
(??) you won't
think twice about.
It was over before I
could do anything.
I did everything.
Why the hell did
you let them go?
- I'm so sorry.
- Martin.
Are you okay?
Albright's card.
It could help you. That was you.
- Wasn't it?
- Yes.
I rode your coattails for forty years.
I thought I was..
Repaying you for the
life you've given me.
I should never have said it.
Why did you ever say yes?
So much for the
wisdom of experience.
Goddamnit.
How hard are the seizures?
Tony used to get those too.
This should be enough
to hold you over.
Until when?
I had the pills..
Reverse engineered.
- Jesus!
- Judith was scared we'd run out.
And I couldn't .. I
couldn't stand the idea of
​​Albright having so
much control over us..
A day and a half to Mexico.
A few grand for a pharma plant
to make you 6 months supply.
And you're home free. Damian.
A new beginning.
There's a little girl.
She's the same age as Claire
was when I moved out.
We have no idea where
Albright operates.
Even if you wanted to.
You'll never find them.
12 hours.
No pills.
No matter how bad it looks.
I need to stay under.
When Albright brought
Mark to his facility.
He brought him there to die.
Men. No reason to hide it.
I do this.
Maybe I get a glimpse
of something, anything.
Important.
We're looking for an
abandoned warehouse.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You have any idea how many
warehouses there are in New Orleans?
Yeah.
Well, how many of them
story mardigras floats?
You still have the boat?
You should've seen him
when I first met him.
He was torn to pieces in
a Russian prison riot
I could've let him
die, but I saved him,
and I resurrected him
three times since then,
and each time he's more loyal.
More grateful.
Where are they?
Well, we have a client that
Madeline is a perfect match for, and
the girl's organs will not be wasted.
Yes, it was built to withstand 500,000mg
radiation, quite bulletproof.
You know, Damian, every
medical advance has a cost.
The choices that you're
making and what you're doing,
they don't make you a savior,
you know that, right?
It makes you a psychopath.
I understand that
you feel that way.
You know, initially, I tried for years
to grow the vessels, of course I did.
But my failure held
everything up.
Eventually, I'll succeed and all this
unpleasantness will be seen as nothing more
than birth pangs.
Now as you can see, we have prepped the
body of a 40-year-old accountant for Anton,
but it seems that Mark's comes hardwired
with some very useful instincts
I'm sorry, Damian. I really am.
But its about time that someone
worthy made use of it.
Please, don't struggle, as you can
hear, Anton doesn't have much time.
Clear!
Hello.
Can you hear me?
Can you tell me your name?
What's your name?
Anton.
How many children do you have?
None.
Just a couple of pictures I
downloaded from the internet.
Carry on.
The woman, where is she?
She's down the hall in storage.
Good.
Give me your gun.
I don't think
that's a good idea.
I've had my legs torn off
and I've been burned alive.
Give me a gun.
Come on, let's go.
Daddy?
Damian?
Oh!
- No! Please.
- Hey, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
- It's okay, it's time to go.
- Damian?
- Yeah, come on.
- Oh!
Who's Damian?
Hey. I'm just a technician.
Go.
Baby..
A little metal.
You see, sometimes I do
listen to doctor's orders.
Well played.
But ..
If you kill me..
You commit suicide.
Because without the full
course of those pills,
well you relapse, you relapse.
And we both know who takes over.
Don't we?
You see I'm the only one
with the answers, Damian.
You need me.
I'm the only one standing
between you and oblivion.
25% Promazine.
30% Olanzapine,
15% of Trileptal.
15% of Valporic Acid,
and 5% Phenobarbatol.
Okay ..
Hey.
Okay, guess what?
- You like boats?
- Mm-hm.
About half a mile down there,
there's a boat waiting for you.
White sandy beaches, and
turquoise water await.
Aren't you coming
with us, daddy?
Uh..
I don't think so, pumpkin.
Why?
- Come here, baby.
- Why, Mommy?
It's okay.
Why isn't Dad coming?
Are you still mad at him?
He knows your birthday,
mom, ask him.
Ask him ..
If you're looking to volunteer,
there's a signup sheet by the door.
Thanks.
Hello.
I'm Ed Kidner, I was a
friend of your father's.
May I sit?
Sure.
I spent a lot of time with him.
At the end, in particular.
I know that you two, you
weren't always close.
If you can hear him talk
about you, he was..
Proud.
I have something for you.
It's just uh ..
I think he regretted not being
around when you were growing up.
He knows that he could never..
Make that right.
Sometimes I think he
made a mistake, thinking
his checkbook could
solve everything.
This is a letter.
Just some things that he should've
said to you while he was alive.
So read, um ..
Well, whenever..
Whenever you like.
Thank you.
I should uh, get back to work.
Of course. You have
important work to do.
I should be going too.
Claire, good luck.
Hi Mark. Welcome
to the Caribbean.
My name is Damian Hale, and I'm
the guy who bought your body.
Lots happened since
you've been gone, uh ..
And you're gonna find
that out in time.
I just want to thank you for these
months that you've given me.
I uh.. haven't taken
one of those in days.
You've been uh, going through
withdrawals on that bed.
Behind you, waiting, waiting
for you to take over.
And I can already
feel myself fading.
And soon I'll be gone.
Welcome back Mark.
Now your wife is there.
You take good care of Maddy now.
What?
Ya.
Yeah.
It's you. Yes!
- Anna!
- Daddy!
Oh my God ..
