Cotton.
Well, what's this? I got him.
No!
- What's this?
- That would be a troublemaker,
- a little troublemaker.
- You think you're going to church?
- Yes.
- Jump in the shower, honey.
We're going to church.
Going to church. We are going.
Come on, come on, come on.
Want to get the door?
Thank you, Justin.
Thanks.
One of the most anointed men of God
that I think I've ever met in my life,
- I think you know my son.
- Yeah.
I think you know my son. Yeah.
Reverend Cotton Marcus.
Let's give another hand for Jesus.
<i>I started preaching pretty young.</i>
<i>You know, my father was a preacher,
and every preacher has to have a hook</i>
that's gonna bring the people in,
that's gonna get them saved
and, well, frankly, get
them in their wallet,
'cause a church
doesn't run on love,
<i>and, you know, the child
preacher was a great novelty.</i>
<i>So, he started grooming me
in order to preach.</i>
<i>Other kids were outside playing, and
I'd be learning the Gospel of John.</i>
<i>And by the time he invited me up
on the pulpit one Sunday,</i>
<i>you know, as a surprise,</i>
to let the people know
and the congregation know
that the Holy Spirit
had visited his son,
as spontaneous as that act
may have seemed to the congregation,
we were ready.
I'm saying right here, if you want
an answer, if you want to know...
- Do you want to know?
- Yes!
Look right here!
It's right here, brother. Right?
<i>Well, Cotton is quite a character.</i>
He's what you would call a performer,
a showman, a...
He's a natural creative.
<i>For example, we have a local theater
here, and Cotton writes plays,</i>
<i>and he's making
these little mini movies now.</i>
<i>He's built props for them, special
effects. Oh, my goodness.</i>
I mean,
he entertains like nobody's business.
And, you know, it starts here with us,
<i>but, of course, it carries on
into his professional life.</i>
Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
Yes, you do!
<i>I mean, so many churches are boring.
People don't want to go,</i>
<i>but when Cotton's there,
it is never boring.</i>
Folks, I'm here to tell you today
that the world is filled
with many, many faces.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Right? Now, some of those
faces, they're good.
They're right with God. Right?
And some of those faces,
they're gonna lie to you.
- You gotta watch out for them.
- Absolutely.
So, I'm here to tell you today,
make sure you don't fall for
a pretty face, all right?
- Amen.
- Amen.
'Cause that pretty face just may
indeed be the prince of lies.
- That's right.
- Yeah.
'Cause I'll tell you right now,
his lies are everywhere.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
<i>It's all about rhythm.
And you get them going,</i>
you hallelujah, and blood of Christ.
- They love the blood, and...
- They love the blood?
Yeah, I mean,
they're practically not listening.
You get them in the right spot,
they're not even listening.
- I mean...
- No, they're listening.
No, they're so much so not listening,
I could talk about anything.
I could talk about
my mom's banana bread recipe in the...
- Oh, God, no.
- You don't think so?
- See, now you're...
- You don't think so?
No, you're underestimating your crowd.
When I go back in there,
I will preach a banana bread sermon.
No, don't do that.
That's embarrassing.
I'll bet you 10 bucks.
Do you believe that
if you go ahead and
allow the Holy Ghost
into your heart,
you can be cleansed of all your sins
and sit in the kingdom of God?
- Amen.
- That is what I'm talking about.
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen.
- Can I get a hallelujah?
- Hallelujah.
- Can I get a hallelujah and an amen?
- Hallelujah, amen.
Do you know if you take two ripe
bananas, you put them in a bowl,
and you put some sugar
and you go ahead then bake it for 400,
you can go and pull it out
and have yourself banana bread?
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
Hallelujah, yes, you can.
Praise Jesus, praise Jesus.
We're in my dad's office,
and actually, that's very special,
'cause he doesn't let
anybody in his office.
Don't let them see the
combination, Dad.
I won't. Yeah.
Yeah, please don't film this
combination, sir, it's...
To be honest with you,
I'm the only one that knows it.
Me and my accountant.
This is the "Hortus Deliciarum".
There are about 20 in the whole world.
You can show it to them.
Show it to them.
This book describes
the various kinds of demons.
Helps you identify them,
and then recommends the process
for getting rid of that demon.
We have had exorcists
in our family...
for generations.
Generations. And, we...
How many exorcisms you think
you've done with this book?
Hundred and fifty.
Hundred and fifty exorcisms, yeah.
The original story
of Lucifer is this:
Lucifer, indeed, was
an angel at one point.
Some people say that he was actually
the choirmaster of heaven,
<i>for lack of a better word.
He was helping raise hosannas to God,</i>
<i>but he decided
he wanted the praise himself,</i>
<i>and with that, God cast
him out of heaven.</i>
<i>He took a third of the host of heaven
with him,</i>
<i>and those are your demons
that you have today.</i>
<i>And then what you have, basically,
is the set-up of the entire Bible.</i>
<i>You have the soul of man
being fought over.</i>
<i>God wants you to
turn to the light of</i>
<i>him, and Satan wants
to grab your soul.</i>
<i>Because ultimately Satan wants to
overthrow God, so you have this clash.</i>
The Bible is filled with demons.
If you believe in God,
you have to believe in the devil.
Jesus himself was an exorcist.
Therefore, if you are Christian
and you believe in the Bible
and you believe in Jesus Christ,
you have to believe in demons.
Mostly people contact
me by my website.
Yeah. But this, this is old school.
Yeah.
That's from Ivanwood.
This is from Georgia.
And this one says,
"Please open immediately. Urgent."
<i>Exorcism is alive and well
in the present age.</i>
People think of it as being a scourge
of the Middle Ages
that somehow went away
and was cured by science,
but the fact of the matter is
it's never gone away.
Exorcism today
is bigger than it's ever been.
The Vatican used to have, like, 20 or
25 sanctioned exorcists on the staff.
Now they have well over 300, and
that's just what they're telling us.
And, you know,
they're not telling us everything.
And that's just the
Roman Catholic Church.
They get all the press
'cause they got the movie,
and that's what's
sort of culturally...
Right.
But the reality of it
is that exorcisms are performed
by every religion all over the world.
As a little boy, I thought this was
in every newspaper all over the world.
Tell me what your dad does.
He fights with the demons
and the vampires and all the ghosts
and all the monsters.
And fights all the ghosts
and the demons and the vampires?
And the monsters.
Do you believe in ghosts?
Does your dad believe in ghosts?
I do not believe in
actual demons, no. No.
But when I was doing exorcisms,
you know, I acted like I did.
It's not like I saw any demons
come out of anybody.
So, for the last something-odd years,
you've just been a fraud?
That's your word, not mine.
I wouldn't say that.
I would say that for the
last couple of years,
what I've been doing
is doing what I've always been doing,
which is delivering a
service for a person
who needs it in a way
that they need it.
I'm not saying I'm a doctor,
but I am saying that I helped
heal people from what ailed them.
And what ailed them sometimes
was the thought in their brain
that they were possessed by a devil,
and if I helped make that thought go
away and they felt better, so be it.
<i>I got a life, I got a
family to feed. At</i>
<i>least that's how I
used to justify it.</i>
<i>Well, basically, everything changed
when Justin was born.</i>
<i>He was born early, and so there was
a while where we weren't sure</i>
<i>our son was gonna be alive,</i>
and then finally, we found out
that he was gonna be okay.
And in that moment,
Cotton was so relieved,
and he was just, like,
"We are so lucky, we are so lucky."
The best I can do is say,
"Thank you, Doctor," you know?
I should have been thanking God,
but that wasn't my first thought.
I mean, it just wasn't.
And that realization really shook me.
<i>That was a real crisis of faith.</i>
<i>I started to question
whether I actually ever</i>
<i>even believed in God
in the first place.</i>
<i>I just... Boom, you know, I started
preaching so early and kept going.</i>
<i>Yeah, I was good,
and I got rewarded for being good,</i>
<i>and so who wants to stop that?</i>
So, even when I started to have
this revelation
of maybe I don't believe in God,
and yet I'm still presenting myself
as a preacher, it didn't stop me.
I mean, I was on autopilot.
It's what I do.
But it wasn't easy. You know, it got
harder. There's no doubt about that.
He would have quit eventually,
at some point anyway,
but there was this one story,
this little boy named Victor.
His name was Victor Turoy,
from Harrisburg, Texas.
<i>This little boy was autistic,</i>
<i>and he was suffocated to death
during an exorcism,</i>
with well-meaning people trying to get
this demon out of this child.
I read that article and at the same
time, Justin was about this boy's age,
and I started having
this recurring nightmare
<i>where I was the exorcist</i>
<i>and I was wrapping a plastic bag
around my own son's head.</i>
I was watching my son die every night,
and I'd wake up in a cold sweat.
It was not long after that,
I was in there washing dishes,
and he came out of the office,
<i>and he had this story about the new
pope opening an exorcism academy.</i>
<i>I mean, he was visibly shaken,</i>
and he said, "Do you know
how many more people this will hurt?"
You know, and that's when
I really decided that I was done.
I had to get out of that.
I'm not interested
in participating in
that whatsoever.
I'm not participating in...
What I want to do is expose exorcism
for the scam that it really is,
and that's why we're doing this.
So if I can help expose
it for what it really is
and save one kid from having
a plastic bag wrapped around his face,
that sounds like God's work.
What I thought we'd do
is that we will open an envelope
and we will follow that request
wherever it takes us,
and I'll let you follow me,
and that way you can film all the
behind the scenes of my exorcism.
Pick the one on top.
It's from Ivanwood, Louisiana.
They're basically all the same.
There's a whole bunch
of people out there
who are definitely convinced
that they are possessed.
There's probably some
sort of crop failure
or something wrong
with the livestock.
"I feel that I am dealing with a case
of possession by the devil himself."
"My livestock is being
slaughtered nightly."
"Little doubt
that who is doing this gruesome..."
"Please, please, please," right?
Looks like we're going to Ivanwood.
Get Daddy's candlesticks, okay?
- I love you.
- You'll do great. Love you.
Give me a hug.
You just really...
Bye, guys. Love you.
It's amazing down here.
It's got a real unique feel.
Nothing like it in any other part
of the country. And it's ancient.
Some of the plantations
here have been
standing for, you know,
hundreds of years.
And this is the only
part of the country
that's been flown under
six different flags,
so it's a real mix of culture and
superstition and folklore down here.
You've got voodoo, you've got
Roman Catholics, Pentecostalism,
all these different beliefs, you know,
rubbing up against one another.
And they're all looking to save you.
They're all looking to be the answer.
There's a lot of illiteracy
and a lot of poverty,
and between that and the
stopped-in-time feel of the place,
it's like a perfect breeding ground
for demons and evil and...
Can't fight the devil
without the armor.
Granted, it's linen, but
it's hot down here.
Sorry, sorry.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss this.
Maybe I'll sell real estate.
Turning onto Louisiana Interstate 39.
Down here, if you ask five people
about a demon story,
they'll give you 10 demon stories.
Yeah? We have time for that?
Sure, absolutely.
About 10 miles out of it.
- Is Bush that way, as well?
- Yeah, Bush is that way there.
- Okay.
- Be careful going down Bush.
You hear so many things about that,
going out there.
I think that the very
gates to hell is
right over there, right
off of Bush Drive.
- Would you... Would you...
- The very gates to hell.
There was a cult in this area,
and there was a temple.
- A cult?
- It's not... Here, you... That's...
Won't be able to describe
exactly where it is now,
but when you get to the Sweetzer farm,
they'll be able to
give you specific...
This guy that ran the cult
was so disturbed that
he actually thought
that he would, like...
He needed to, like,
feed, you know,
feed human souls...
- Sure.
- ...to the devil or whatever.
Where's the UFO landing site at?
That is actually in that direction.
Maybe we could ask this guy.
- No, he's stopping, he's stopping.
- He is?
- Hey, afternoon.
- You guys making a movie?
A documentary, actually.
How's it going?
Great. I like documentaries.
- Cool.
- Good.
Well, we're looking for the
Sweetzer farm. Can you help us?
- What was your name?
- Reverend Cotton Marcus.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.
- The Sweetzer farm, please?
- Yours?
- I'm Iris. This is Daniel.
- Hey.
Sorry, we're just a little
behind schedule. So...
- No, no problem.
- The Sweetzer farm, please.
Right. Well, you're going
the wrong direction.
- You want to make a U-turn, actually.
- Okay.
You want to take this
road and go straight.
You'll see things you've already
seen before. Keep on going.
You're gonna hit the highway. Okay?
And then I want you to go back
where you came from.
Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.
- Gotcha. Thank you.
Sorry about that.
- Okay.
- Jesus!
What? What? Keep going!
- What's he doing? What's he doing?
- Jesus Christ, just go! Go!
You okay?
Yeah.
Seems like the end of the road. Well,
there's a tractor. That's a good sign.
Here's a farmhouse of some sorts.
This has gotta be it.
You know what?
Let me just make sure it's him
before you guys get out. Okay?
All right.
- Mr. Sweetzer?
- Yeah.
- How you doing? Cotton Marcus.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Nice to meet you. Pardon my dress,
but it's a work day for me, too.
No, no, no. That's...
I'm dressed for work myself.
I understand that. Well, listen.
I can't
thank you enough for
coming out here.
Absolutely. I reckon...
I just figured...
- Hey. Watch out for this kid.
- Hey.
We just met him on the road.
Well, I apologize.
That's my son, Caleb.
- My apologies.
- No, what did he do?
Well, you know, it was probably
just a misunderstanding.
We asked for... Doesn't really matter.
Hi, good to see you again.
Hi. Thank you so much.
- What's your problem, boy?
- You know they got cameras?
You got cameras?
I was gonna tell you about that. These
are my friends. They came with me.
- This is Iris and...
- Hi. Hi, how are you?
- And Daniel.
- Hi.
Appreciate it. I'd like you to
turn the camera off, though.
Let's go ahead and just turn it off
for right now,
and let's go talk about
it, as a matter of fact.
Yeah, great.
This is the second bull I've lost.
Two goats and, I don't know,
several chickens.
Could this have come
from an alligator?
But an alligator,
they bite and roll and take chunks.
Not a big, straight cut like that.
You don't think
Caleb could have done this, do you?
No. I'm sure it was Nell.
- And Nell is?
- My daughter.
Right. I knew that.
I remember that from the letter.
I should have read the letter
a little more thoroughly.
I thought it was Louis, not Nell.
I don't like working with kids.
That's from last night.
One just like this
every time I lose an animal.
- She doesn't remember this?
- No, sir.
She doesn't remember anything.
And so it really
frightened her a lot,
and so I just quit
asking her about it.
- Hello. Is that Nell?
- Hi. Yes.
Hello, Reverend Marcus.
- Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.
- Thank you for coming up.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Just... Can you come this way?
This is my room.
- Did you do those?
- Yeah.
- Wonderful.
- Thank you.
And this is actually
the story of Esther of Antioch.
She's not from the Bible.
It was something I dreamed of.
- Yeah.
- All this artwork and detail,
it's really well thought out.
I'm very, very impressed.
Well, that's...
So, I just want to, you know,
if you don't mind, Nell,
tell me how you're feeling.
Tell me what's been going on.
Your dad told me about the livestock.
What do you know about that?
Well, I can only think one thing,
that I killed them.
Do you remember killing them?
- No, but...
- Do you remember getting out of bed?
Do you remember walking
down the stairs?
- Do you remember walking outside?
- No.
Do you remember doing anything
to the animals at all?
No, but...
Well, then maybe you
didn't do anything at all.
As I mentioned in my letter,
my wife died two years ago.
It was cancer,
and she was being treated,
we thought successfully, for breast cancer,
and then six months later,
it metastasized into her bones,
<i>and three weeks after
that she was gone.</i>
<i>It was quite a shock, especially for Nell.
I mean, she was 14 years old.</i>
<i>Just coming into young womanhood,
and so it was very difficult.</i>
I saw that picture downstairs.
You look just like your mother.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I saw the painting downstairs.
- Thank you so much.
That's such a compliment.
She's so beautiful.
She is. Well,
so is her daughter, so...
Thank you so much.
Thank you, sir.
Were you very close?
Plus being a mom.
Yeah, she was my best friend.
Yeah. That's safe to say.
She was my best friend.
Did Caleb act any different
after your mom passed?
I think Caleb got frustrated.
He got kind of scary.
He started hating God a lot.
How about your father? How has he been
affected since she's been gone?
It hit him very hard.
It hit him...
If it weren't for my wife, Delle,
and the faith that she instilled in me,
I don't think I would
have made it through.
So, since she died,
I have been very determined
to give my children a more
fundamental Christian upbringing.
<i>I'm not real crazy
about the influences</i>
<i>that exist in the world today,</i>
and therefore I decided
to home-school Nell.
For a while, I let her go to the
Sunday school at our local church,
but that just didn't
seem right, either.
Pastor Manley didn't really teach
only religious music.
So, that's why he pulled me out.
Your dad likes religious music then?
Yeah. Yeah.
I've tried keeping her
as close as I possibly could,
maybe even a little too protective.
I'll admit to that.
But somehow, still,
the devil got in her.
<i>Her mother gave her a small crucifix,
and it burns her.</i>
<i>The symbol of our Lord,
and she can't wear it.</i>
I don't know if it's Nell who's
going around killing those animals.
I know she's really isolated out here.
That's gotta drive you crazy.
But the burning cross,
that's just like a nickel allergy.
You get a reaction
like that on your
skin, especially if
you're stressed out.
Hey, son.
Hi.
Why were you throwing rocks at me?
Are you still gonna
perform an exorcism?
An exorcism? Well, I don't know.
That's what I'm here to find out.
'Cause, apparently, there's deaths
involved and people have died.
Well, if you're worried
about something like that,
I'm here to go ahead and assure you
nothing like that happens with me.
I'm here to help.
We don't need your help, though.
Well, your livestock do.
They seem to be dying left and right.
You know anything about that?
I know my father's a
superstitious drunk.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well, do you think
he's superstitious or
drunk enough to harm
his own animals?
It's possible, you know. I don't know.
Do you think
Nell had anything to do with it?
No, I don't. I don't think
Nell's the problem.
Nell doesn't need help.
Well, I... That remains to
be seen, now, doesn't it?
If anything happens to her,
I will hurt you, okay?
And I don't care if the
camera's watching.
Okay? It can watch all it wants.
I will hurt you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, son.
Thank you.
There you go. Nice and relaxed.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- No.
Okay, 'cause you can't be nervous
when I do this.
- Okay. Let's try again. There you go.
- Okay.
- Feel any pressure?
- A little.
You do?
Well, my throat's been a little sore
'cause I've been waking up screaming.
So, you have a sore throat, as well?
Well, just 'cause I've been waking
up screaming, like I said before.
That's all right.
There's nothing to be nervous about.
It's absolutely fine.
Night sweats and night fevers
and the loss of appetite
and fatigue in the afternoon and...
What?
- What?
- An...
What?
Let me have your finger. Come here.
Right back here. Can you feel that?
Right there, that indention?
Nell, look straight ahead, please.
Have you always had it this deep?
- Have you guys checked this at all?
- I guess it's deeper now, but...
Yeah, it's a lot deeper now.
Louis, would you get
me a pan of water big
enough to go ahead
and put her feet in.
- Pan of water. Excuse me.
- Yeah.
I need you to take
your socks and shoes off, okay?
Very pretty shoes you got.
Thank you.
I like your shoes. They're real nifty.
Want to try them on? Here you go.
Hey, they look good on you.
They look...
They're yours.
- No way, Miss Iris.
- Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.
- I got a pair of Converse in the car.
- No, please. I mean...
You look good in them,
and I'm sure you
can't find them in
300-mile radius, so...
Oh my, Miss Iris. This is the
nicest thing that's ever happened.
Dad, look. Miss Iris
gave me her boots.
Well, let's take
them off your feet
right now. How about
that for starters?
There you go.
Okay, lift them up.
Let's all close our
eyes for a moment.
Let's all close our
eyes and pray to Jesus
to help us out
in this time of need right now.
Oh, Lord, we ask you
to please give us your strength,
give us your hope and give us
your clarity. Please help us.
We ask you to please
take care of Nell,
and in this test, may you please
show us an unadulterated sign
of whether or not we should continue
upon this way,
if we should go ahead and indeed
find out whether we should
- continue down the path...
- Reverend Marcus.
Is this regular water?
Yes.
That's the temperature change.
I was afraid of this.
We will proceed with the exorcism.
It's okay.
I'm afraid that I suspect that Nell
is possessed with a demon named...
"Abalam."
Abalam.
What is this? What is...
What kind of language is this part?
- Do you not read Latin?
- No, sir.
- It's all right. I got it for you.
- So...
What this tells us is...
Abalam. Inside. Abalam.
- Right there. See, you can see.
- Right, right.
What it says is he's very powerful.
He is perhaps the most powerful being
in the entire book.
What he does is like a snake.
He wraps himself around the coil,
the soul of the person,
and that is why
there's the temperature fluctuation,
up, down, like Nell was showing.
The thing about Abalam is that he
preys on the flesh of the innocent.
He defiles the flesh of the innocent.
- That is what he does.
- Defile?
And it's particularly bad
when he's in young girls.
Look at him.
It says right here
that the possessed's
only salvation will come in death.
What? The only salvation is death?
Unless she is exorcised.
You're a fraud.
Hello, Caleb.
You threw something in there.
I saw you. But I won't tell, okay?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
That was really good.
We don't have any problems now.
This will shake nicely.
Come in.
Come now. Stand here for a second.
Caleb, if you would, over there.
Louis, beside her.
Nell, go ahead. Get on the bed.
You can sit or you can lay down.
Whatever makes you comfortable.
Are you comfortable?
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Nothing to be nervous about.
Gentlemen, I do not need your help
unless I ask for it.
I ask you to respectfully
stay over there.
What I need from you gentlemen
is your faith.
- Yes, sir.
- Your courage and your love.
Because why we are here
is because we love
Nell, and we want
Nell to get better.
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, Reverend.
Well, then let's do that. Let's start
by praying to the Lord, our God above.
Please, let us close our eyes.
"Beside restful waters, he leads me.
He refreshes my soul."
"He guides me in the right paths,
for his namesake."
"Even though I walk in the dark
valley, I shall fear no evil,"
"for you are by my side with your rod
and your staff that give me courage."
- Do you have courage, Nell?
- Yes, sir.
Do you believe in
Jesus Christ, Nell?
Yes, sir.
Do you believe that Jesus can
get this demon out of you?
Yes, sir.
Then let him expel
the demon from you.
I say, demon, begone,
in the name of Jesus Christ.
I say, demon, cast yourself out.
Leave this girl.
In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord,
and the blood that washes over her,
I say, demon, begone!
I command thee to begone!
No, demon. Don't listen.
Pay no attention. Don't listen at all.
No. No, no.
- Don't worry.
- Hey.
Don't listen to that, Louis.
Pay no attention.
Pay no attention! For he
is the father of lies.
All he knows are lies,
where all we know, the father of love.
- Oh, my God.
- The prince of peace.
Our Father who art in heaven...
The God above who
shall save you all.
- ...please, please!
- Save you all, save you all
by the power, by the power, name and
authority of Jesus Christ, as it...
Sound is so important. Got my player.
I go ahead and program
over 800 different demon sounds.
Trust in the Lord. The
Lord shall save you.
- Reverend, the...
- The Lord shall provide for you.
- Reverend, he is here! He's here!
- The laws of our God.
Do you believe in Christ? Do you
believe that Christ shall heal you?
Do you believe that Christ can heal
you, Nell? Can Christ heal you?
- Yes, Christ can heal me.
- Then be healed!
That's right. Be healed! Be healed.
- Say, I love Jesus.
- I love Jesus!
Say that I love Jesus!
I love Jesus Christ.
Believe in Christ Jesus, be saved.
Saved!
These are two 9-volt batteries,
and attached are wires at the end.
And then you go ahead and run
one of the wires down the sleeve,
and then you attach it right in there.
Believe, believe! Believe,
believe, believe!
Oh, my God...
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command thee to leave!
In the blood of Christ,
demon, get thee out!
I can't do it.
You have to. You have to.
God, take me!
Take the demon from this girl.
Grant me thy will, O Lord!
Take the demon, O Lord!
Let me take the demon!
- Praise God.
- Oh, God.
<i>The demon is gone.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>The demon is gone. The demon could not
withstand the sign of our Lord!</i>
<i>Praise God!</i>
You're okay?
- How's she doing? Yeah.
- She's sleeping like a child.
With a little smile on her face.
That's fantastic.
- It's all there?
- There's no reason to count it.
Thank you. Take care.
- Thank you all. Thank you.
- What?
- No, I was just saying thank you.
- What? I can't hear you.
Reverend?
I don't understand.
Reverend.
The Lord has a prophecy
for you, Louis.
The Lord says he knows your pain.
He knows that you're sad
for your wife to be gone.
The Lord says, rejoice
for she is with him.
The Lord does not want
you to bottle it up inside.
The Lord does not want you to stuff
your anger and your sorrow
and your burden into this bottle
and drink from it.
- No, sir.
- He does not want you to do that.
- No, sir, no. Lord, I won't.
- He does not want you to hide.
- I won't.
- He wants you to smash that bottle,
and in its place,
he wants you to accept love.
He wants you to accept
the Lord's love.
I will. Thank you, Lord.
That was highly impressive.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Much more than I expected.
- Hey, Louis.
- Yes, sir.
Now, just remember.
I took the devil out of your house,
but it's your job to keep him out.
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
Now, listen. You sure I can't
convince y'all to stay with us?
No, no, no. Thank you
for your hospitality.
We're gonna find a motel up the road.
- All right.
- Take care.
She did? Well, why
don't you put her on?
Can you do that for me?
I love you, too. Brush your teeth.
Brush them.
Justin said you were crying.
Is that true? What's going on?
We're paid up on that.
He needs a new hearing aid.
We are paid up on that.
I am sure of it.
Who's Cassandra?
You know,
I used to want to have a TV ministry.
I thought that'd be cool.
And now, frankly,
all I really want is health insurance.
- You got what you needed today?
- Yes, really, really awesome stuff.
- Thank you. You have a good night.
- All right.
- Good night, good night.
- Good night.
What is she doing here?
What is she doing here?
- I don't know.
- What can I do?
I don't know. She hasn't said a word.
Nell? Can you hear me?
She hasn't responded
to anything I've said so far.
Where's her dad?
I have no idea. That's
why I called you.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I woke up. She was standing here.
- Nell. Nell.
- Daniel, stay back, okay?
I think she's bleeding.
Nell, are you okay? Honey?
Honey, can you hear me?
Okay, be gentle with her.
I'm gonna call her dad.
Honey, can you tell
us how you got here?
Honey.
I'm not getting any answer here.
Nell, stop.
Okay. No, we need to
get her to a hospital.
Nell. Nell. Oh, my God.
I've seen people react, but not 10
hours after the fact in my hotel room.
Their farm is 5 miles
away from the hotel,
and how did she even know
where I was staying?
And that's why I don't work with kids.
Is there a doctor around?
We have a little girl who's sick.
Well, yes, but what... Hey, where
are you going with that camera?
- Sorry. He's with me.
- He's with us.
Okay, well, he can't be with you. He's
gonna have to turn the camera off.
Okay, well, he's not
gonna shoot inside.
That's fine.
As a matter of fact, I need him to
turn it off and take it outside.
- We don't allow filming in here.
- Okay, okay. All right, that's fine.
I understand. No problem.
We'll turn it off.
What part of turn the camera off
do you not get?
Take the camera outside
or I'm going to call security.
Excuse me, sir?
Thank you.
- Is that the doctor?
- Yes, but that camera is turned off?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yes, yes.
Well, it looks like we got
most of the blood tests back...
And?
...and everything
appears to be normal.
So, what we're gonna do
is let her continue to rest right now.
Can you run
some sort of psychiatric tests on her?
No, we'd have to have
the parents' permission to do that.
Now, what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna wait for the rest
of the tests to come back.
This is Mr. Sweetzer.
Louis Sweetzer, I'd like
to see my daughter.
This is the father.
Mr. Sweetzer, if you
can wait just a minute,
let me see
if I can get in touch with the doctor.
- So, this is...
- She was standing, babbling,
- then she was lying on the bed.
- Well...
You watched her do all this?
Why didn't you call?
I did call you, but nobody answered.
Louis, I feel very
strongly that she needs to
have some professional
take a look at her.
- She's a young girl. A doctor...
- Excuse me.
- Yeah? Pardon me.
- Mr. Sweetzer.
Thank you.
If you could sign this and give me...
What is this?
That's gonna be
a release for your daughter.
This is just for release.
It's not about any tests or anything?
- No, sir.
- Do you have the form
that he could sign
in order to get psychiatric tests?
Can we have that?
Mr. Sweetzer hasn't
asked for any forms.
Louis, how do you get...
Since we're here.
No.
- I'll let him talk to the doctor.
- Please, you didn't...
It looked like
the sort of thing for a young girl,
considering what
she's been through...
I think we know what Nell...
Mr. Sweetzer.
Nell, how you doing?
Do you remember
being at the hotel last night?
- Did you know you were at his hotel?
- I think so.
Do you want to wait and talk
to the doctor, Mr. Sweetzer?
No, I don't.
What happened, Reverend?
That's the question.
Well, I believe that
the demon is gone.
It's as if Nell's house
had been vandalized.
The robber is gone,
but we need somebody else
to put things right again...
No, don't slough it off
to the big city doctor thing.
Eight of them could not save my wife.
Eight of them could not
prolong her life one day.
And psychiatry?
Psychiatry is not of God.
Louis, the tools that
God provides for us
<i>sometimes are not always the tools
that we recognize or the tools...</i>
"Our weapons of war are not carnal."
"They are mighty in God
for the pulling down of strongholds."
Am I right? Am I right?
Yes, yes, yes. Absolutely.
Amen to that.
That's what we're
dealing with, Reverend.
He's stuck on this idea that I'm some
sort of slick, big city preacher.
He's not gonna listen to anything
I have to say.
Let's get somebody local.
It's got to be that one over there.
- Hi.
- Good afternoon,
I'm Reverend Cotton Marcus
from Baton Rouge.
- Hi, I'm Becky.
- Nice to meet you, Becky.
- From where?
- Baton Rouge.
- Okay.
- I'm looking for Pastor Manley,
- if he's around by any chance.
- Yes, he's right back there.
- What are you all doing?
- We're making a movie.
- So, are you all shooting this now?
- Yeah.
- So, will I be in it?
- Yeah, you will.
Pastor Manley, we've
got us some visitors.
All right.
Afternoon, Reverend Cotton Marcus
from Baton Rouge. How you doing?
Welcome to Second Calvary.
- Thank you.
- Hi.
I know he respects the church,
but at this point,
since I'm an outsider,
he's not respecting my opinion,
'cause I'm pushing him to go see
a doctor, 'cause she's not well,
and I was hoping you could back me up.
Well, let me tell you
my history with Louis.
When she was unexpectedly
pulled out of the Sunday school...
- Right.
- ...we never found out exactly why,
but he was definitely hostile.
He felt that our Sunday
school curriculum
wasn't, you know,
sufficiently medieval,
and this was not the same Louis
that I originally knew...
- Did he threaten you at all?
- No, not per Se,
but there were voices raised.
So, I think I'm the last guy
that Louis would really
take counsel from.
Wow. Yeah, maybe.
And as I say, I mean, I wasn't afraid,
but it was very uncomfortable.
How long ago was this?
Two, I guess it's...
Since I've seen Nell,
two and a half, two
and a half years.
It's been two years?
They haven't even come to church?
No. And I heard about
the home-schooling thing.
I'm not really one to sit here
and say whether that's right or wrong.
I will say that Nell was, when she
was here, a vibrant, happy girl,
and I just don't think
to be cut off is,
you know, the best
thing for the child.
Would you be willing to come out
to the farm with me?
If... Okay, I tell you what.
You get Louis to agree for me
to come to the farm,
and I'll be happy to do that.
I also can line up...
I have a good friend,
psychiatric head of
the department in
Baton Rouge, that I
can line up for Nell.
Right. Okay, well, I'm gonna get
back to the farm. Thank you, Pastor.
- Well, let me know. Great.
- I appreciate your time.
You get the pastor
to make his contact...
What's going on over there?
That doesn't look good.
I want my mother. I want my mother.
She's fine. Get
that damn camera off.
I want my mother.
I want my mother.
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Caleb, you okay?
Can you write?
All right, all right. All right, here.
Caleb? Caleb?
Louis, we need to get him to
the hospital. Really bad pain.
- Louis, what happened?
- He was trying to calm Nell down,
and she attacked him with a knife.
- She did this?
- Yes.
- I got to get him to the hospital.
- Yeah, you better do that.
Could you take him for me?
We need to get him there.
Louis, what if the demon comes back?
I need to be here for that.
You be well.
Look what Caleb wrote.
That's why I wanted to stay.
Nell?
Nell, honey. Can we come in?
- He locked her in.
- Yeah. Hey, honey.
Oh, my God. Hey.
- Are you kidding?
- Let's go find something,
something to get her out of that.
I'm bad. I am. I'm bad.
No, you're not. You're not bad.
Nell, you're not bad.
He's gonna be mad when he comes home
and I'm not chained up.
Okay.
- I'm not gonna go to heaven.
- Honey, yes, you are.
You'll go to heaven. All right?
You'll go to heaven. Oh, my.
I remember hearing screaming,
and when I woke up, his face was cut.
Does Caleb frighten you at all?
Does he ever hurt you
- or tease you or anything like that?
- No, no. Never Caleb.
Nell, has your father ever hurt you?
No.
- You can tell me.
- No.
Let's put you back into bed.
What do you say?
You hear that?
- Is she sleepwalking?
- I don't know.
Nell?
Honey, can you hear us?
Honey?
- Nell?
- Nell? Honey?
Oh, my God. Nell. Nell!
Okay. It's okay. Right here.
Just a doll. You're giving
your doll a bath. That's all.
Hey. Here we go.
Here we go. It's all right, honey.
It's gonna be okay.
Let's take her to bed.
Well, you look better.
I can see your eyes now.
Did you make this?
No.
This is what I got
while we were in the bathroom.
I don't know how she'd
know Latin, though.
- Maybe Louis taught her.
- He doesn't know.
So, it's Nell making
those baby noises?
Yeah.
<i>Nell.</i>
- What's going on?
<i>- ...and you can give her Pepto-Bismol</i>
<i>for her nausea, which is very
common at this stage of a...</i>
<i>Hi, this is Dr. Kile
from the Ivanwood General.</i>
<i>We just want to make sure
that Nell does not take the Halcyon,</i>
<i>as the person that prescribed it
did not know that she was pregnant.</i>
<i>And you can give her Pepto-Bismol
for her nausea, which is...</i>
Well, this explains it.
There you have it.
Your underlying trauma.
All they told us was
that she was pregnant.
You don't know who she's pregnant by.
We're dealing with incest, okay?
Abusing his...
Iris, you can't go saying
that sort of thing down here.
It would ruin a person's life,
you understand?
It's right there. It's obvious.
I mean, it's right there.
We have to wait for him to come back
and talk to him.
That's exactly what we have to do.
You can't...
We need to take her,
and we need to leave.
We're not taking her anywhere.
That's kidnapping.
Well, then what?
You're gonna keep exorcising her
while her dad's raping her
upstairs in the bedroom?
Okay, why don't we just take a break?
Can we just take a break?
What? What kind of
break are we taking?
We have to wait for
him, no matter what.
- Fine.
- All right.
Guys, why don't we just take a nap for
an hour? We're all pretty wiped out.
Okay, great.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Nell! What are you doing?
It's okay. Good girl. Let go. Let go.
- Put the camera down.
- I'm so sorry.
Let's get some clothes on you.
Seems to be all right.
Guys, come here. Take a look at this.
- Oh, my God.
- Look at these pictures.
- Same cat picture.
- Wow. Look at this one.
Yeah, something's on fire.
Maybe the house.
And look at this one on the right.
Is that me?
Yeah. It's all of us.
All of us dead.
- I'm in the fire.
- I'm in a million pieces.
Daniel, you get your
head chopped off.
She's more messed
up than I thought.
Not comfortable with what?
Well, I'm not comfortable
that we're in a house with someone
who's doing pictures of my head
being chopped off. You know?
Relax. It's just a bunch of drawings
from a little girl's imagination.
Yeah, imagination's one thing,
but she killed those animals, and
she cut her brother up pretty good.
Well, do you think she's gonna hack
you to pieces and cut your head off?
- Is that what you think?
- No, that's not what I'm saying,
but we've seen signs
of her being dangerous before.
They're just drawings, Daniel.
You know,
I mean, we happen to be in the house,
and we happen to be in her drawings.
She's a 16-year-old girl. All right?
We can overpower her if we need to.
Yeah, well, a 16-year-old girl
and a 16-year-old psychopath
are two different things.
She's psychotic, but she's not capable
of chopping your head off.
- Are you worried about that?
- I'm not worried.
I'm just saying
that we should be concerned...
Guys, just take it easy, all right?
- We're all tired and...
- Right.
...we're here to help her, okay?
So,
let's keep things in
perspective, okay?
- All right, all right.
- All right, fine.
- They saw you drag him around?
- Probably. No doubt.
I'm gonna kill them both.
- You hear that?
- Sounds like there's two people.
- Who were you talking to?
- No one.
I swear there were
two people in there.
<i>...just want to make sure
that Nell does not take the Halcyon,</i>
<i>as the person that prescribed it
did not know that she was pregnant.</i>
<i>And you can give her Pepto-Bismol
for her nausea,</i>
<i>which is very common
at this stage of a pregnancy.</i>
<i>But please do not
give her the Halcyon.</i>
<i>- The book was right.
- Thank you.</i>
<i>If you have any questions,
please call us here.</i>
- The book was right?
- Book was right.
- What are you talking about?
- The demon defiled my daughter.
My daughter is a virgin,
16-year-old virgin.
How did she get pregnant?
The book said it. You showed it to me.
I don't think
the book has any bearing on this.
I think it's more earthly matters
that we're dealing with now.
Reverend, I need you to perform
another exorcism.
Get rid of that thing. I will not
let that thing grow inside of her.
Louis, I'm not gonna perform
another exorcism.
Reverend, I need you to help me.
I need you to help Nell. Please.
I don't believe a demon had anything
to do with this.
Reverend, I need you to do another
exorcism for the soul of my daughter.
Louis, this is not
about an exorcism.
I need you to do this.
Louis, I'm not gonna do an exorcism.
What she needs is a doctor.
I know this must be
really hard to hear,
but Nell's welfare
is what we're all concerned with.
Right, Louis?
Reverend, if you can't save
my daughter's soul, I will.
What are you talking about?
I would like you all
to leave my property.
If you're not off
my property in five
minutes, I will consider
you all trespassers.
Now, Louis. Louis, you need
to be reasonable. Louis.
I bet he doesn't want to
take her to a doctor.
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.
I don't want to wait around to find
out what he's gonna do to Nell.
I'm afraid he's gonna
try to hurt her.
He's gonna kill her.
Death is the only salvation.
You told him that.
Yeah, I know. I think you're right.
We should just take her.
Just grab her and go.
- How are we gonna do that?
- We'll just take her and go.
- What's he doing?
- He's still praying.
He's got a lot of guns
in the house, Cotton.
I know.
Come on.
- Cotton, what is that?
- I don't know. Somebody upstairs.
- Nell?
- Nell?
I have a key. I have a key here.
Hang on, Nell!
Nell!
Come on, honey.
It's us. Come on.
There you go. That's a good girl.
That's a good girl.
That's a good girl. Right here, yeah.
It's Cotton. It's Cotton. Come on.
Come on, honey. That's it.
That's it. Good girl.
Good girl. It's gonna be okay.
Here you go. That's good.
Nell, we're gonna go now.
We're gonna get you in the car.
Are you okay?
Nell!
Nell!
Nell, stop!
Nell?
- You okay?
- It's not that bad.
Nell?
Nell?
Here.
- What is she doing?
- I don't know.
Lights are on. Louis is here.
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
- We'll get back to the hotel.
- Fine.
- We'll call the cops from there.
- Fine. Do you have the keys?
- Yeah.
- Here. Cotton.
- Nell.
- No, let's go. Can we please just go?
- Cotton.
- Here, come here. Come on.
- Nell?
- Cotton.
- Nell, are you all right? Honey?
- Cotton.
Nell, look at me. Can you look at me?
No!
Iris.
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!
- You got her?
- Oh, God.
- Louis!
- Look.
It's Louis!
Louis, put the gun down, please.
Please.
Get the door! Lock the door!
Get away from the door! Come here!
- He's coming!
- Come here.
- Let her go! Get away!
- No! Louis, no!
- You don't want to kill her.
- Move away from her!
- No, no.
- Shoot me, Daddy!
- Nell. No, Nell.
- Just shoot me!
I was wrong. You were right. She's
possessed. I'll do another exorcism.
I'll do it.
<i>I set out to make this documentary
to save children,</i>
<i>and now I'm gonna get her killed.</i>
<i>- What would you have said?
- I don't know.</i>
It's a no-win situation.
What, is she gonna
admit that she's pregnant?
And then what?
Soon, we're all gonna have
a shotgun in our face.
What could a second exorcism
possibly accomplish?
Hey, Nell.
I didn't get him out. I didn't get
the demon out. It's my fault.
But if you can be strong,
I need you to do it one more time.
- Can you do that for me?
- No, I don't think I...
I just need to see him one more time.
It's not that I don't
think I can, it's
just that I don't
know how to do it.
- It just comes involuntarily.
- I think you can.
I don't have any control over
what happens to me.
I think you could.
I think if you want to.
I wanted to get better
last time, though.
- I know. I know.
- Sorry.
- That was...
- I really wanted it.
I mean, I don't think I could have
wanted it any more than last time.
I know. I failed you that time.
But this time, I won't.
This time, I won't. I promise.
But I need you to be willing
to bring him up again.
I think you can do it. I think...
I think if you just allow yourself,
I think you can do it.
- Nell, can you hear me?
- Yeah.
All right, I'm right here.
- I'm feeling like I'm falling a lot.
- Okay. Well, you're right here.
I've got you right here.
- But it's getting hard to see you.
- Okay.
Here we go. I'm right here.
I'm not going
anywhere. I'm not going
anywhere, honey.
- Right here.
- What is that?
- There's nothing there.
- What is it?
There's nothing there.
I'm right here, honey. I'm right here.
Right...
What? Don't. Please, help.
It's right...
- It's coming.
- Good, let him come.
Let him come, Nell.
He's coming through my skin.
Get him out of my skin. Please.
It's okay. I'm right here.
I'm right here, Nell. It's okay.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
Nell?
Nell.
He has her!
Nell, can you hear me? Nell?
Reverend Marcus.
I hear you don't believe in me.
Who are you?
Abalam.
- Where's Nell?
- In the fire.
She's been there for some time.
Soon you'll join her.
Don't believe the demon's lies, Louis.
The demon's lies?
If I invoke the name of Jesus Christ,
our savior,
you should be compelled
to leave this girl.
If I beseech our Lord and invoke him,
and I say,
"Put on the whole armor of God,
"that he may be able to stand
the wiles of the devil.
"For while we wrestle not
against flesh and blood,
"but against principalities,
against powers,
"against the rulers of darkness
in this world,
- "against the spirits! We have..."
- Words.
Words, words, words!
I'll tell you what.
If you can keep quiet for 10 seconds,
I'll let the girl go.
- Yes.
- Agreed.
One.
Two.
Nell.
- Three.
- Stop it. Stop it!
- Honey. Honey, stop.
- You lose.
- Louis, I'm sorry.
- Do something.
I'll do something, Daddy.
- Reverend, how about a blowing job?
- Nell.
What did you say?
What's a blowing job?
Tell me what that is.
You don't know, do you?
You don't even know
that's not what it's
called, because you
are not a demon.
A demon would know what that is.
But maybe not a 16-year-old
home-schooled girl.
Because I don't think
you're a demon, Nell.
No.
I don't think you're a demon.
I think you're an innocent girl.
- No.
- I think you're an innocent girl.
I think you're a little
innocent girl who
doesn't know what
she's talking about!
I think you're an
innocent little girl!
No! No!
That's what I think!
I think you're a little girl!
She isn't innocent!
She isn't innocent.
- It's okay. It's okay. Let it out.
- She...
It's all right. It's just...
Turn the camera off.
- She isn't...
- It's gonna be okay.
- She isn't innocent.
- Let it out, honey. It's okay.
- She isn't innocent.
- Turn it off.
Turn it off!
She looks like she's resting.
She is relieved,
and she is resting really well.
- Praise God.
- Praise God, indeed.
Louis, do you know
a boy named Logan?
No.
He works at a cafe or a restaurant
somewhere around here.
Is Abalam gone?
Louis, your daughter
doesn't have a demon.
Your daughter's
suffering from shame.
Nell is pregnant, and
the father is Logan.
No, sir. That's impossible.
I'm afraid not.
Louis, you have to admit that if
Nell says that's what happened...
She's delirious.
Look what she went through.
- Look what she went through.
- Listen to her yourself, okay?
We'll talk to Nell ourselves,
and we'll hear it from her,
and you'll see the truth that she has.
Can we do that?
A couple years ago
when her mom was dying,
and he came by and asked her if she
wanted to go for a ride in his car,
and he was driving a sports car.
It was old, but still a sports car.
And she got in it, and they
started driving out to a field.
Then he turned to her and he asked her
if she wanted to have sex.
And she said yes.
She asked him, she
said, "Am I pretty?"
And he said, "Yes."
He said, "I think you're so pretty."
And he took her and
he laid her back.
Stop it!
- She loved how he touched her.
- You were raped! You were raped!
- She said yes. She liked it.
- That's enough, honey.
Well, she's right about one thing,
Reverend.
There is a boy that
works at that cafe,
and I have no idea what his name is,
but for all I know, he could be Logan.
Pastor Manley,
Reverend Cotton Marcus calling.
Could you please call me back?
I'm at the Sweetzer farm.
Pastor Manley, thank you so much
for coming out.
Reverend Marcus, a pleasure.
- Good to see you. Welcome.
- Good to see you.
- Well, just don't forget to smile.
- Hello.
Louis is upstairs with Nell.
She finally admitted that Logan
was the boy who impregnated her.
Logan.
Yeah, he works at the
cafe down the road.
I know him.
So, frankly, Pastor,
I don't know what more I can do
for them at this point.
Is Louis on board with psychological
help with my friend in Baton Rouge?
Yes, do you... I think Louis would be
amenable to that at this point.
I'll be... I'll call him first thing.
- Louis.
- Pastor Manley, thanks.
- It's been too long. Good to see you.
- Thank you for coming, sir.
My pleasure.
- Hello. I'm Louis.
- Becky.
- Hey, Nell.
- Hi.
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you.
"I cried out to you, O Lord.
You are my refuge,"
"my portion in the land of the living.
Please attend to my cry."
"Please attend to this child,
for thou art stronger"
"than any possible thing that could
attack this lovely servant of yours."
"Bring this child's
soul out of prison"
"that I may praise your name."
I'd be lying if I said I was sure of
everything I did when it came to that.
I've never seen anything like that.
Poor Nell.
She's gonna have to get
some serious help.
Louis could use some, as well.
Hey, what was the name of that cafe
that that boy worked at, Logan?
- Riche's, right?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Hi, how you doing?
She's lying, all right? I'm not
the father of her child at all.
I don't even know the girl.
We met once, you know.
It was Pastor Manley's party,
and we were both there,
and she saw me,
and she started talking to me
for, you know, maybe,
like, a minute. Okay?
- This is Pastor Manley's house?
- Yes.
- Last summer?
- Yes, last summer. But...
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
I didn't get her pregnant, though.
And another thing, I don't...
She's nice and everything, but I'm not
exactly, interested in, you know...
- Girls.
- Right. So, she's lying.
What's a pastor doing throwing a party
for a bunch of 16-year-olds?
He said he hadn't seen her
in three years, right?
Yeah, he's lying. And Nell was lying,
'cause the kid was obviously gay.
- Yeah.
- Why would she lie to us?
To get rid of us? Maybe she wanted
to get us out of the house.
Yeah, but why?
- What are you doing?
- Turning around.
- Going back to the house?
- Yeah.
Louis!
Louis!
Oh, my God.
Cotton, the phones have been
ripped out of the wall.
- Do you hear that?
- What?
Cotton? Cotton? Cotton, listen to me.
Cotton, please.
- This is insane.
- We need to find Nell.
She's got a point, Cotton.
Turn off that light.
That's Nell right there on the table.
Is that Louis?
- It is Louis.
- Is he tied up?
- Oh, my God.
- We should get the police, guys.
- I want to get out of here.
- Wait, wait.
That's Pastor Manley.
That's Pastor Manley.
Is he leading the thing?
- We got to get help right now.
- What are they doing?
- What are they doing with her?
- What is it?
- Oh, God.
- That isn't human.
Hail Abalam!
Daniel, I want to get out of here.
Right now.
We got to go. We got to go.
Cotton, what are you doing?
Cotton. Cotton!
Demon, you cannot
have the soul of this
girl, for she is a
creature of God!
- The one with the camera! Get him!
- Daniel, they're coming! Run! Run!
Go! Go! Go!
- Wait! Please! No! No!
- Kill her! Kill the bitch!
Caleb.
