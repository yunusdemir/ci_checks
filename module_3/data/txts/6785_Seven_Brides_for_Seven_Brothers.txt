Whoa.
That's a little over
10 pounds.
- How much is beaver
worth this year?
- Six dollars a pound.
Well, I'll trade you
for a new plow,
Two tubs of lard,
a barrel of molasses,
25 pounds
of chewing tobacco.
And you wouldn't have a wife
under the counter there?
I'm looking for a wife.
Any special brand?
Well, yes.
I'd like best a widow woman
that ain't afraid to work.
There's 7 of us men,
me and my 6 brothers.
The place is like a pigsty.
The food tastes worse.
So I made up my mind...
Next time I come into town to trade,
I'm gonna bring me back a wife.
Well, that's a fine thing,
I must say!
Thinking you can come here
and trade for a wife like she was
a bag of meal.
Oh, no, ma'am.
I wouldn't say that.
Well, let me tell you,
None of our gals is gonna go off
to bear country with you.
To cook and wash and slave for
7 slumocky backwoodsmen.
There's 10 men
for every woman out here.
If you want a wife, you'll have
to go back east and get one.
You mean there's
no unmarried females in this town?
[Bell rings]
- Good morning, mrs. Bixby.
- We're having a quilting bee.
We thought you might
have some odds and ends.
I'll see.
- How about these?
- Now, just a minute.
What's the matter?
They married?
- They're spoken for.
- Oh, just spoken for.
- You had me scared.
- I tell you, they're promised.
A lady can change
her mind, can't she?
Pay him no mind, girls.
Fred, please,
put his things in the wagon.
Don't keep him waiting.
I'm in no hurry.
I got all afternoon.
You're wasting
your time.
You won't find a girl in this town
to marry you.
I never set my mind to
something but what I got it.
Whether it's plowing
20 acres in a day
Or dropping a tree within
an inch of where I want it.
I'm here today
to get me a wife,
And I don't aim to
go back home empty-handed.
Now, you're all pretty
and fresh and young.
I'll keep you in mind.
But I ain't deciding on nothing
until I look them all over.
[Whistling]
# Bless your beautiful hide,
wherever you may be
# We ain't met yet,
but I'm a-willin' to bet
# You're the gal for me
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.
Mamma, mamma,
papa wants you.
# Bless your beautiful hide,
you're just as good as lost
# I don't know your name,
but I'm a-stakin' my claim
# Lest your eyes is crossed
Ha ha ha!
# Oh, I'd swap my gun,
and I'd swap my mule
# Though whoever took it
would be one big fool
Thanks, Adam.
# Or pay your way
through cookin' school
# If'n you would say, "I do"
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning, Backwoodsman.
Nice day
for marrying.
That's
a right good idea.
Oh, Lem, I thought
you'd never ask me.
# Bless your beautiful hide,
prepare to bend your knee
# And take that vow
'cause I'm a-tellin' you now
# You're the gal for me
# Pretty and trim,
but kind of slim
# Heavenly eyes,
but, oh, that size
# She's got to be right
to be the bride for me
# Bless your beautiful hide,
wherever you may be
Milly, where are ya?!
A dozen men in here
bellowing for victuals, and
you're chopping wood!
I'm coming!
# Pretty and trim,
but not too slim
# Heavenly eyes
and just the right size
# Simple and sweet
# And sassy as can be
# Bless her beautiful hide
# Yes, she's the girl for me
Milly, Milly,
let's eat.
Yeah, let's eat. Come on.
I'm dying of hunger.
You'll all eat, now. Don't be
frettin'. Just give me time.
Ah, nobody can
cook like Milly, huh?
- When you gonna
marry me, Milly?
- Oh, next week, Sam.
Oh, she's gonna marry me,
ain't ya, Milly?
What would
your wife say, Tom?
- Anything you'd like?
- Could be...
But first I think I'd better
sample that cooking.
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Oh, Harry!
Oh, I am sorry.
That's all right, Milly.
Awfully sorry.
That smells
good enough to eat.
Tastes good, too,
so they tell me.
Got any ketchup handy?
My stew can stand
on its own feet.
Good?
Good.
[Moo]
My name's
Adam Pontipee.
Odd name, I must say.
I live up the mountain.
I got a farm up there.
Have you?
Good farm...
and a house on it.
There's timberland,
high grazing meadows,
Sheep, milk cows,
50 acres of wheat.
Only thing it ain't got,
ain't got a woman.
How about it?
How about what?
I just told you.
How about
marrying me?
Oh, I know it's kind
of short notice.
Back east, we would have met
on a Sunday leaving church.
Six Months later, I would
have asked you,
"Could I
walk you home?"
Next 2, 3 years,
I would have set in your front parlor
every Wednesday night.
And finally I would have asked
your father could I marry you.
But here,
there's not time.
I've got to be home tonight
to tend to my stock.
It'll be another 5 months before
I get down again with my grain.
You going to keep me
waiting all that 5 months
just for your pride?
I'd have to finish
my chores.
I knew it the minute
I set eyes on you,
You were the gal
for me.
I'll go get cleaned up a bit
and root out the preacher.
# Bless her beautiful hide,
wherever she may be
Uh, where's
the preacher's house?
Down the street,
next to the church.
Thanks, pop.
# She's the gal for me
Now, I'll say it plain, Milly,
and to your face.
I don't like
this marriage.
I don't know you or
anything about you,
And I feel responsible.
Milly's like a daughter to us.
We're her only family.
Reverend, ever since I came here,
You've been after me to marry.
"A girl had no right
to stay single", you said.
The country needed
to be settled.
We meant you to marry
one of our young men, Milly.
You had your pick
with them.
I tried.  Again
and again, I tried.
I'd say yes
to one of them,
But then an awful sinking feeling
would strike me right here,
and I couldn't do it.
When I said yes
to him,
I waited for that feeling.
But it didn't come.
I feel just fine.
I feel so good
I could cry.
Oh, I think it's wonderful...
Love at first sight.
Alice, what kind
of talk is that?
You're determined, Milly?
- Yes, reverend.
- Then step forward.
Take her hand
in yours.
Repeat after me...
I, Adam Pontipee.
I, Adam Pontipee.
Take this woman to be
my lawfully wedded wife.
Take this woman to be
my lawfully wedded wife.
Where's she going?
Never did like
them Pontipees.
Now I know why.
Maw, Maw, he done it!
He got a wife!
[Gasp]
It's Milly. It's indecent,
if you ask me...
One lone woman with 7
scroungy backwoodsmen.
# Bless your
beautiful hide
# Wherever you...
I guess I'm not much of a bride,
with only this for an outfit.
You'll find a trunk in the attic
belonged to my mother.
There's things there, if
you're handy with a needle.
I'd like that.
I'd like to be wearin' something
that belonged to your mother.
My mother
left me these...
They're packets of seeds
for a flower garden she meant
to plant out here.
My father
left me these...
Plutarch's "Lives"
and the Bible.
He taught me
to read by them.
I hope that maybe someday
I can teach our...
How far is it
up to the farm?
Oh, about 12 miles.
Imagine... on my way
to my own home.
I feel so wonderful
I could yell.
Go ahead.
Hooray!
[Echoing]
hooray... hooray... hooray...
Ha ha ha!
That's echo pass.
It ain't safe to
raise your voice in the winter.
It might start an avalanche.
I cussed my horse too loud
one february, we got snowed in
till spring.
Most people think that
would be pretty lonely,
But I can stand
some loneliness after the inn.
I reckon I'd better
water the horses.
Whoa.... whoa.
My wedding bouquet.
Sorrel?
Oh, it makes real
nourishing soup.
Always back at the inn,
when I'd hear all the men yelling
and screaming for their dinners,
I'd think how wonderful
it would be to cook and care
for one man.
Just one man.
Now that
it's happened,
- I can't hardly
believe it's true.
- Ahem.
# Ding, dong,
ding-a-ling dong
# Were the steeple bells
Ever quite as gay
# Wonderful,
wonderful day
# Bluebirds
in the bluebells
# Sing a song to
send me along my way
# Wonderful,
wonderful day
# Though I've got
to own up
# I'm as grown-up
as can be
# Seems I've gone
and flown up
# To a bright, merry,
airy fairyland
# And so
you'll forgive me
# If I simply throw out
my chest and say
# Beautiful, glorious
# Heavenly, marvelous
# Wonderful,
wonderful day
# Big clouds floatin' lazy
# Like a daisy in the sky
# Big things to be doin'
by and by
# Goin', slowin',
growin' things
# Big love
for my darlin'
# As we share
whatever may come our way
# Beautiful,
glorious
# Heavenly,
marvelous
# Wonderful,
wonderful day
[Dog barking]
Whoa!
[Cow lows]
Oh, uh, this is
my brother Caleb.
How are you,
brother Caleb?
My wife, Milly.
Your wife?
Well, I'll be
a monkey's uncle.
Hey, Eph, Dan, he done it!
He got married!
This is my brothers
Ephraim and Daniel.
Hiya, brother Ephraim,
brother Daniel.
Which one is Ephraim,
and which is Daniel?
- Me.
- Me.
And this here
is Benjamin.
How are you,
brother Benjamin?
You didn't tell me
you had brothers.
Well, it must have been
the wedding, threw it
out of my mind.
You all live
around here?
Not around... here.
Oh.
I guess I should have picked
some more sorrel.
Uh, this is the house.
My, what a nice big room.
Well, it... might be readying up
a bit, but now that you're here.
Wake up.
Wake up and meet your
sister-in-law. This is Frank.
How are you,
brother Frank?
And this here
is Gideon.
You can drop
that spoon.
We gonna have some human
cooking around here for a change,
now that she's here.
- Are there any more?
- No.
Gideon's
the last born.
It'll take me a little while
to put the right name
with the right brother.
Just remember
your ABCs...
Adam, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel,
Ephraim, Frank, and Gideon.
- They're fine-sounding names.
- Yep.
- Bible names.
- That was Maw's idea.
ABCs, that was pa's,
so he could keep track of us.
He was figurin' on using
the whole 26 letters, right down
to Zachariah, but...
he got a look at Gideon
here, and went and chopped
a tree down on himself.
There's one of the names in the bible
I don't seem to remember
Frank.
Is Frank a bible name?
Oh, that ain't his real
name, is it, Frank?
We just call him that for short.
His real name is Fran...
You pay him no mind.
I'll show you around.
Move here now.
Up here's the bedroom.
- Can't you stop them?
- Oh, you'll get used to that.
Now, like as I was saying...
Well, what happened?
Was it something I said?
Oh, no. Frank's just touchy
about his name, that's all.
There was no "F" names in the bible.
So Maw named him Frankincense.
Because
he smelled so sweet.
Now, look... Like I was saying,
up there's the bedroom.
Down there's where
the boys bunk.
You follow me,
I'll show you the rest.
Uh, this is
the washroom.
Me and the boys
are kinda hard on clothes.
So there'll be a lot of washing
and mending. But now that...
that I'm here.
This
is the kitchen.
You'll find flour
in that barrel right there.
Salt pork
over there.
Get out of here,
all of you!
How do you expect her
to get supper with you underfoot?
Come on, all of you,
get out of here.
You, too, Gideon.
Come on.
You'll find wood
down the path, and...
water's right outside
the front door.
There's the dinner bell.
So... ring it loud when you
get supper ready.
[Clanging]
Ow!
What'd you do
that for?
You... all of you falling
on the food that way!
Haven't you any decency
to wait for grace?
Huh? No!
You don't even know
what I'm talking about!
- What's the trouble?
- Look at your brothers!
The victuals
must be good.
All right...
If you're going
to act like hogs,
You can eat
like hogs!
Oh!
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
"Neither cast ye your pearls
before swine,
"Lest they trample them
under their feet
And turn again and rend you."
[Ticking]
[Clock chiming]
It's about time for you boys
to turn in, ain't it?
Got a big day of
plowing ahead tomorrow.
It's 9:00 already...
An hour past your bedtime.
Yours, too.
[Snickers]
Well, uh...
I am getting
a mite sleepy at that.
- Who is it?
- It's Adam, your husband.
Come in, Adam.
Good night, boys.
I, uh, thought
you'd be in bed.
Did you?
It's been
a right busy day.
You must be kind of
tuckered out.
That's right.
Shall I, uh, turn
down the covers?
You can if you like...
But I'm
not going to bed.
You don't want
a wife, Adam.
You want a cook,
A washerwoman.
A hired girl.
Well, a hired girl's got a right
to a sleeping place of her own.
I reckon that's so,
Milly.
All the way up in the wagon,
you let me talk...
Make a fool of myself
talking about you and me.
You should have
stopped me!
Maybe I should have,
But it sounded
real pretty.
Besides, if I'd have...
if I'd have told you beforehand,
you might not have married me.
And I wanted you
to marry me, Milly.
- I wanted it real bad.
- Sure you did.
Because you knew
I was young and strong and
there was lots of work in me.
That's partly true.
It's a hard life out here
in the forest and wilderness.
There's trees
waitin' to be felled,
Land waitin' to be
plowed and fenced,
Stock to be fed.
A man wants a wife
who can work alongside him.
Of course, if...
if she's got eyes that
are bluer than cornflowers
Hair the color
of wheat in the sunshine,
He counts himself
real fortunate.
I'll work alongside
you, Adam...
But I'm not sleeping
alongside you.
She wants a drink
of water. She's thirsty.
[Gasp]
Have a drink.
What are you doing?
Bedding down
for the night.
Don't know what
the birds see in it.
Somehow it just
don't seem fitting
for a bridegroom to spend
his wedding night in a tree.
It was your idea,
not mine.
I guess I was
pretty mad, Adam,
But...
I built up such
a store of dreams,
Dreams about love and...
and marriage
and such.
# When you're in love
# When you're in love
# There is no way
on earth
# To hide it
# When you're in love
# Really in love
# You simply let
your heart decide it
# With every sigh
# With every glance
# With every heartbeat,
you confide it
# You'll want the world
to know it, too
# When you're in love
# As I'm in love
with you
I know how it is
with your brothers,
You being the head
of the house and all.
I wouldn't want you
to lose face.
And, well,
all things considered,
Maybe you'd better
come back in.
[Rooster crows]
[Dog barking]
Bacon!
Fresh-made coffee!
Hot bread!
It's Milly cooking!
[Takes deep breath]
Adam must have told
her what was what.
It sure smells good.
- I'm hungry!
- I feel like I haven't eaten for years.
Where's my pants?
Where's my shirt
and pants?
I'm looking
for my own.
Who did it?
Who hid them on me?
All I've got
is my boots.
Milly: good morning,
my brothers.
If you're looking
for your outside clothes,
they're hanging up drying
on the line. I came in before
and got them.
I couldn't get your inside clothes,
So I'll take them now.
Our underwear?
Your winter underwear
that you're sleeping in.
You might as well hand them over,
'cause you're not gonna get
your clothes or food or nothing
until you get all
cleaned up. And shaved.
Where's Adam?
We want to talk to Adam!
He's out plowing. He had his
breakfast over half an hour ago.
I got hot muffins
waiting,
Crisp bacon,
hot cakes, steak,
Fried potatoes,
fresh-ground coffee.
Now, do I get that winter
underwear, or do I have to come in
and take it off you?!
Don't listen to her.
She wouldn't dare.
Oh, wouldn't I ?
All right, all right,
you'll get it.
I didn't know last night I'd married
into such a handsome family.
You know, you're mighty
good-looking boys.
Well, you are,
every last one of you.
What you been doin' goin' around
hiding behind those whiskers?
Afraid some girl will see you
and run off with you?
Why haven't I seen you
at dances or cornhuskings
at harvest time?
Don't you like girls?
We ain't never
hardly ever seen one.
You've got a big sister now.
That's gonna see that you do.
Ahem.
You wanna eat?
Well, then...
O' lord, thou hast
brought us through desert,
mountain, and wilderness
To a good land.
A land of wheat and game
where we need never hunger.
We thank thee, O' Lord, for thy
loving care and thy bounty. Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
After you.
Thank you.
Where you going, Milly?
I've got to go
to town, Gideon.
The flour barrel's getting low,
and I've worn a broom and
scrub brush clear through.
I'd better go along
and help you tote them.
- What's going on?
- Milly and me's goin' to town.
Reckon I'll go along
and help drive the horses.
I'll drive.
Hey, Milly's
going to town!
Hey!
Let's go with them!
Whoa!
You boys set here and wait.
Gideon will help me.
And don't forget...
mind your manners.
Hey, look... girls!
Quick.
Say something.
Huh... Care for
a chaw of tobacco?
- Hey, what's going on?
- That oaf insulted us.
- Oh?
No such thing. All he did
was offer them a chaw of...
Well, it's dang
good tobacco.
It is, huh?
Hey, it's us!
My window!
Stop it, Benjamin!
Stop it this minute!
Don't just stand there.
Do something.
What for? There's only
three little ones.
Stop it,
do you hear?
All right, Milly.
It's stopped.
You get
in that wagon.
Get!
What did I do wrong,
Milly?
Well, first off, if you
want to get a girl,
You got to learn
how to talk to her.
I'll show you.
I'm a girl. You meet me
comin' out of church.
You raise your hat.
What's the matter, Caleb?
My hair
ain't combed.
Well, next, you got
to say something nice.
Gideon,
say something nice.
Nice night
for a coon hunt.
Ha ha ha!
You get out of here. Git!
You're beating your head
against a stone wall, Milly.
You'll never make
jack-a-dandies outta them.
You pay him no mind 'cause
you're all gonna be just fine.
Besides, it's a whole month
before the barn-raising and the picnic.
There's one thing
you gotta remember.
You're going to have
a lot of competition
Because every one of those
girls down there has 5 or 10 fellas
buzzing around her.
- We'll clean them out first thing.
- Yeah, the whole lot of 'em.
No, no. That's one thing
you mustn't do.
If they want to act like
a pack of hyenas, let them.
You've got to be
above such things.
You've gotta act gentlemanly
and well-spoken.
And show the girls that
you have some etiquette.
Eti-what?
Like I showed you
at the table.
When you meet a girl, don't
grab her like she was a flapjack.
Hold off for a while.
Offer her your arm.
When you've
got her alone,
Steal your arm
around her.
You got to court
a girl to get her.
You got to call her
my darling, my dear,
My precious, my pet.
# Going courting,
going courting
# Oh, it sets
your senses in a whirl
# Going courting,
going courting
# Dudin' up
to go and see a girl
# Oh, it's fun
to hunt and shoot a gun
# Or to catch
a rabbit on the run
# But you'll find
it's twice as sporting
# Going courting
Is this what you mean?
It's what I mean.
# Now, there's lots of things
you got to know
# Be sure the
parlor light is low
# You sidle up
and squeeze her hand
# Let me tell you fellas
that it's grand
# You hem and haw
a little while
# She gives you
kind of half a smile
# You cuddle up,
she moves away
# Then the strategy
comes into play
Ow!
Ha ha ha!
See what I mean?
# Going courting,
going courting
# If you find it hard
to break the ice
# Going courting,
going courting
# Here's a little
feminine advice
# Roll your eyes
and heave a little sigh
[Sigh]
# Grunt and groan
like you're about to die
Uh!
# That is what's
known as emoting
# Going courting
How about sparking?
- Parlor's darkened?
- Yeah.
And you're longing
for a fond embrace?
- What about petting?
- And sofa setting?
Suppose she ups
and slaps your face?
# Just remember
blessed are the meek
# Don't forget
to turn the other cheek
# Pretty soon,
you'll both be larking
# Going sparking
# Going dancing
Brothers:
Going dancing
# At a fancy ball
or minuet
May I ?
# Going dancing
# You'll impress them
with your etiquette
Now you two try.
Come on.
You mean men are
learning how to dance ?
# Yes, it came direct
from Paris, France
# It will help
with your romancing
# Going dancing
Come on, now.
You follow us.
Turn.
Down, up.
Turn. Down, up.
Come on. This way.
Step to the right
and then the left.
Make a turn.
Now weave in and out.
Hey, this is great!
I love dancing!
Ha ha!
I'm dancing!
I'm next.
Now, boys!
Yippee!
Oh!
Oh, boy!
Yee hee hee!
# Keep your dancing
# And hunting
# And shooting
# And fighting
and trapping
# 'Cause we're going courting
The cleanest
fingernails I ever saw.
What happened
to your thumb, Gideon?
Oh, I soaked it in lye.
Took off the dirt all right,
but dang nearly took off
the nail with it.
Oh, I'm so proud of you...
all of you.
Just remember one thing...
mind your manners and
be real gentlefolk.
And no fighting,
no matter what happens.
What's
holding you up?
If we're going to go to
a barn-raising, let's go!
Come on.
Whoa.
Who are they? I don't recall
ever seeing them before.
They're
strangers to me.
Seven of them!
And all as tall
as church steeples.
It's Milly!
Milly!
- Where are you going?
- To see Milly.
I just love Milly.
Looks like them
Pontipee brothers.
Milly!
Alice!
Mil, I've missed you so!
Milly, it's been months
since I've seen you.
Oh, I missed
you all so much.
I baked some things for
the collation. Pies and such.
Did you? Oh,
we'll take them over.
I'd be pleasured
if you'd allow me.
Why, thanks.
We'll all help
carry some...
I couldn't let a little
lady like you heft that.
Can we help?
Huh, please,
allow me, ma'am.
If you'll just follow me.
To the ends
of the earth.
Afraid that's all.
I'm sorry.
That's all.
May I escort you
back?
You know, you're the
prettiest girl I ever acquainted.
May I escort you
to the ball, ma'am?
Well, it wouldn't hurt you
to learn some manners, too.
What do I need
manners for?
I already
got me a wife.
Hey, come on, everybody,
get your partners!
There's going
to be dancing.
[Music starts]
Ha ha ha!
Hey!
Hey!
[Girls squeal]
Faster.
Hey, attaboy,
Carl!
[Cheers]
[Cheers]
Woman:
what happened?
Woman:
I don't know.
Man:
take him, Dan.
- Come on, Dan!
- Go ahead.
Get him.
Come on, Caleb!
All right, Frank.
Come on, Frank.
Come on, Frank.
You got it now.
[Cheers]
Ha ha ha!
[Cheers]
Neighbors,
may I have your attention?
All you folk that have
come from far and wide,
Henry here wants me
to thank you men
for coming to help him
raise his barn.
Thanks, folks.
And he thanks the ladies for
all the fancy victuals they brought.
[Applause]
Now, since a barn's got 4 sides,
there's gonna be 4 teams.
The team that gets their side up first,
wins the little heifer.
Henry, show them Annabel.
Now get your teams set up,
neighbors,
And let's see who wins
the little lady.
Adam, we could
use her on the farm.
How about it, boys?
Mr. Perkins, put the 7 of us
brothers down for one team.
Milly says she's taken
a fancy to Annabel.
You hear, boys?
That was Adam Pontipee.
Last time he came to town
he bragged how he always got
what he set out to get.
And danged if he didn't.
He's a hard one to beat,
I'm warning you.
- Don't worry.
- We'll handle him.
That's the spirit!
We got a team
all set up here, Pete.
And here's your
fourth, Pete.
- That's fine. All got your
hammers and all?
- Yeah !...
Then take your positions.
The sooner you raise the barn,
the sooner you get the vittles.
Pete: Are you ready?
Yeah!
Let's go!
Come on, Adam!
Come on!
Ow!
My fault. Sorry.
I guess I shouldn't have
had my hand there.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
Caleb, get that board
up there.
Ow!
Now what
happened?
Oh, I stubbed
my big toe.
Come on.
Let's get going.
Hey, Frank, get those
sideboards up here.
Hurt yourself,
Frankincense?
Oh, come on.
Let's go.
What's the matter
with you boys today?
Just a little
dizzy spell.
Hold it! Hold it!
Take it easy!
He didn't drop that hammer.
He threw it. I saw him!
- We don't want no fights.
- We promised Milly.
We're gonna keep it calm.
So don't start anything.
Come on. We're
way behind now.
She's made you into
a bunch of mamma's boys.
They're out to murder you,
and what do you do?
Apologize for living.
You're a disgrace
to the Pontipee name.
You're a bunch of lily-livered,
chicken-hearted lickspittles.
Serves you right.
I hope they break
your necks.
Come on, Gideon,
let's go.
What are you doing that for?
He ain't done nothing!
Ha ha ha!
[Women screaming]
Oh!
Ah!
No!
Boys, boys,
stop the fight!
Agh!
[Creaking]
[Laughing]
Witch Hazel.
Split lip.
Don't smile
for a few days.
Next.
Two Beefsteaks. Frank.
A kick in
the pants.
Next.
A loose tooth and
swelled-up knuckles.
It's a wonder you have
any teeth left at all.
Witch Hazel, please.
I'm sorry, Milly,
honest,
But when that feller took out
after Adam, an innocent bylooker...
I understand, Gideon.
You all did your best,
I guess.
Good night, boys.
Good night,
Milly.
Good night,
Milly.
I... I feel awful
strange-like, Milly... here.
If it's what I think
ails you, Gideon,
Witch Hazel's
not gonna help.
Alice is sweet,
isn't she?
Good night.
Good night.
Well...
What's the matter
with you?
Somebody butt you
in the breadbasket?
No. I felt this way
even before the fight...
Ever since
I seen Alice.
Adam...
Yeah?
Do you...
Do you reckon I...
I could be in love?
Well, pa used to say
love is kinda like the measles.
You only
get it once.
The older you are,
the tougher it goes.
Young fellow like you
ought to get it kind of light.
Oh, I guess not.
Well, I don't know as I can answer
your question, Gideon,
But according to Milly... and
she's had a heap of book learning...
# When you're in love,
when you're in love
# There is no way
on earth to hide it
# When you're in love
# Really in love
# You simply let
your heart decide it
# How can you tell
# What's in its spell
# How can you tell
until you've tried it
# Wait for that kiss
you're certain of
# And let
your heart decide
# When you're
in love
Wow. I guess
I got the beginnings.
Them townspeople will never
let us court them gals now.
- Not after today.
- Ah, don't let it fret you.
If you don't get this one,
there'll be another one
to come along.
One woman is pretty
much like the next.
Come on. Let's go
feed the stock.
[Nicker]
[Sheep bleating]

Whew.
It is beautiful,
isn't it?
Not to me.
I've seen
too much of it.
I'm getting out.
Why, Benjamin!
I'm not gonna spend
another winter here, snowed in
for 3, 4 months.
What would we do
without you?
I'd miss you so.
There's plenty here to
take care of the farm without me.
- Adam!
- Whoa. Yeah?
- Benjamin says he is leaving.
- What?
He says it's the winter,
but I know it's not that.
He's grieving for his girl.
They're all grieving for their girls.
Why should they grieve for
them girls? They hardly saw them
more than once.
Once is all it takes,
if it's the right one.
Oh, I had such dreams
About all of them
living around,
Dozens of babies
and children,
Visiting back and forth
at christmas time and birthdays.
If Benjamin goes,
then another will go.
And another.
I'll talk to him.
Whoa.
Ha ha.
If you could just get
a look at yourselves...
You look like a bunch
of lovesick bull calves.
If you're so sweet on
those girls, why don't you do
something about it?
Why don't ya
go marry them?
Oh, sure, just "go marry them"
as easy as that.
You know they'd never
let us marry them. Not in
a thousand years.
Then do like the Romans did
with the "Sobbing Women"...
Or "Sabine Women",
whatever they call them.
Those Romans were in the
same fix you're in.
They was opening up
new territory,
and women were scarce,
just like here.
And there was these
sobbin' women down in town.
So what did
the Romans do?
They went down there
and carried them off.
Now, if you can't do as good
as a bunch of old Romans,
You're no brothers
of mine.
Course, this being Oregon
and god-fearing territory,
You'd have to capture
a parson along with them.
Hey, them romans...
They the ones I heard about
settled up north of here?
No, no. This was
in olden days.
Read about it here
in Milly's book.
Oh, a book.
Well, this is history.
This really happened.
# Tell you about
them sobbin' women
# Who lived
in the Roman days
# It seems that they all
went swimming
# While their men
was off to graze
# Well, a roman troop
was riding by
# And saw them
in their me-oh-my
# So they took them all
Back home to dry
# Least that's
what Plutarch says
# Oh, yes, them a-woman
was sobbin', sobbin', sobbin'
# Fit to be tied
# Every muscle
was throbbin', throbbin'
from that riotous ride
# Seems they cried and kissed
and kissed and cried
# All over
that Roman countryside
# So don't forget that
when you're taking a bride
# Sobbin', fit to be tied
# From that riotous ride
So then
what happened ?
Gather around.
I'll tell you.
# They never did
return their plunder
# The victor gets all the loot
# They carried them home
by thunder
# To rotundas small
but cute
# And you've never seen,
so they tell me
# Such downright domesticity
# With a roman baby
on each knee
# Named Claudius and Brute
# Oh, yes, them a-women
was sobbin', sobbin', sobbin'
# Passing them nights
# While the Romans
was going out hobnobbin'
# Starting up fights
- Is that so ?
# They kept occupied
by sewing lots
# Of little old togas
for them tots
# And saying, "someday
womenfolks will have rights"
# Passing all of their nights
- Just sewing.
# While the Romans
had fights
Hey, listen to this.
# Now, when the menfolk
went to fetch them
# The women
would not be fetched
# It seems when
the Romans catch them
# Their lady friends
stay ketched
# Right! Now, let this be,
because it's true
# A lesson to
the likes of you
# Rough them up like
them there Romans do
# Or else they'll think
you're tetched
Oh, yes!
# Them a-women was sobbin',
sobbin', sobbin' buckets of tears
Mighty sad.
# On account of old dobbin', dobbin'
really rattled their ears
And that ain't all.
# Oh, they acted
angry and annoyed
# But secretly
they was overjoyed
# You might recall that
When corralling your steer
# Oh, oh, oh, oh,
them poor little dears
What are you sittin' there for ?
Why don't we go down
and get them ?
# Oh, yes! Them a-women
was sobbin', sobbin', sobbin'
# - Weeping a ton
- Them sobbin' women
# Just remember
what Robin, Robin, Robin Hood
would have done
# We'll be just like
them there merry men
# And make them all
merry once again
# And though they'll be
a sobbin' for a while
Oh, yes.
# We're gonna make
them sobbin' women smile
Yeah!
Yee-ha!
Ha ha!
Adam:
whoa, there.
Go get them.
Be quiet about it.
I'll wait for you here.
Dan! Eph!
Your two's in here.
They're coming out.
- Good night, Liza.
- Good night.
Aah!
You got mine!
[Crying]
Carl: How about my
good-night kiss, Sarah?
Oh, Carl,
you're so persistent.
Be a sport.
Just one kiss.
Well, maybe just
a little one.
Close your eyes.
Why, Carl.
Frank!
What are you doing?
No, Frank, put me down.
Whoa.
Attaboy.
Get them in.
Come on, Frank.
Hey, where's
Gideon?
Meow.
Meow.
- I hear the cat outside.
- I'll go, mrs. Elcott.
Poor pansy, out on
a night like this.
Meow.
Meow. Meow.
Meow.
Meow.
M...
Meow.
Hurry up, will you?
Meow. Meow. Meow.
Meow. Meow.
Meow. Meow. Meow.
Meow. Meow.
Sounds like pansy
has the croup.
I'll look out in back.
Meow. Meow.
Meow. Meow.
Oh, it's all right, Alice.
She's here.
Oh! Aah!
Dorcas:
Ah! Ah!
Jenny:
Dorcas! Dorcas!
Pa! Pa, come quick!
[Women screaming]
Attaboy, Gideon.
Aah!
[Clanging]
- Damn. What's keeping Benjamin?
- I don't know.
[Clanging]
- Keep them quiet.
- Be quiet. Stay down.
Let's get out of here.
Let's go.
Adam: Hah! Hah!
Come on!
Hah! Hah! Hyah!
Come on!
[Clanging]
Sarah Kines...
She's gone!
- So is Alice.
- Ruth Jebson, too.
Where's Dorcas?
It was them Pontipees.
The whole 7 of them jumped me.
Come on.
We'll get them.
Hah! Giddy-up!
Hyah!
[Women yelling,
men whooping]
Make them stop that yelling!
We're coming to the pass.
Keep quiet, or we'll have
an avalanche down on us.
Slow down.
Whoa...
All right, here we go.
Hold your breath.
Aah!
Keep her quiet.
Hah!
Hurry up, Adam.
I can hear them coming.
[Muffled whimpers
and crying]
[Horse whinnies]
Adam:
whoa. Whoa.
All right.
Let them go.
- Aah!
- Aah!
[Gunshots]
There she goes!
[Women crying]
[Men laughing]
# On account of those
dobbin', dobbin'
# Really rattled
their ears
Whoa.
All right, boys.
Line them up.
Oh, Milly! Milly!
What have you done?
- Oh, Milly, help us.
- Milly, we've been kidnapped.
- Make them take us back.
- You take these girls back
at once.  Once, you hear?
- Oh, we can't.
- There was an avalanche.
I guess they'll just have to
wait till spring. That's all.
This was your idea,
wasn't it?
I'd say it was more yours.
It all came out of that book
about them sobbin' women.
What kind of men
are you, anyway?
Are you animals that
you'd do a thing like this?
Swooping down like hawks,
carrying off poor innocents.
Aw, they're just young boys
in love. That's all.
Didn't you tell me just today
you wanted them all married
with wives of their own?
I want
my mother.
Please don't cry, Alice.
I'm sorry, honest.
But it was the only way
I could get to marry you.
- Adam!
- What?
We forgot
to get the parson!
Don't worry.
Go on in the kitchen.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Well, Cheer up. You got 'em,
haven't you?
Everything's gonna turn out
all right. Now, Milly...
This house
is for the girls.
You're not gonna set foot in it,
as long as they're here.
You're gonna eat and sleep
in the barn with the rest
of the livestock.
Now get out of here.
I'm ashamed of you.
Go ahead, boys.
Go on.
Now, Milly...
You, too.
You're taking this
too hard.
Everything's gonna
work out fine.
Me and the boys'll get
a parson up here some way.
Do you think those girls
would marry them now?
You think because
you got a wife so easily...
'Cause I didn't make you
court me and coax me,
That that's all
there is to it?
Well, I said yes to you
because I fell in love with you
the first time I saw you
standing there.
And I thought it was
the same with you, too.
Oh, Milly...
You think a wife is
just to cook and clean.
You got no understandings.
You got no feelings.
How could you do
a thing like this?
When I think of these
poor girls sick with fright
And their families
crazed with worry...
Oh, I can't abide
to look at you.
[Door slams]
This isn't exactly
the way we planned on
spending the night...
In a barn.
What do you think
you're doing?
I'm getting out of here.
Going up to the trapping cabin
and wait out the winter.
You can't do it, Adam.
You can't stay up there alone.
The cabin's got enough supplies
to last for 6 months.
Don't go, Adam.
It's us she's mad at.
Nah. Nah, it's
more than that.
It's something
that goes a lot deeper.
Suppose you get sick.
Or break a leg or something.
Up there all alone?
And the wolves are mighty
bad this year.
The wolves will seem like
good company after what I've
just been through.
[Crying]
There's nothing like
a nice hot cup of tea
When you're
all tuckered out.
Milly. Milly, it's me, Gideon.
I got to speak to you.
No, Milly! Don't!
- What is it?
- It's about Adam.
He's going away
up to the mountains,
up to the trapping cabin.
Milly,
can you hear me?
I hear.
You just speak to him.
Ask him not to go.
Please, Milly.
He's gotta learn that he can't
treat people this way.
Now, Eph, let's
start here.
Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!...
Ha ha ha!
Aah!
Ow!
Ha ha ha!
What's the matter, you
afraid of a little snowball?
Snowballs
with rocks in them!
"Them poor
little dears,
Sobbin' buckets
of tears."
"And when the sign
was given,
"Drawing their swords and
following with a great shout,
They ravished away
the daughters of the Sabine."
[Knock on door]
Who is it?
It's me... Caleb.
What do
you want?
It's a mighty
cold night, Milly.
I, uh, I need
an extra blanket.
Go and get one.
"And continues the custom
to this very day
"For the bride not of herself
to pass her husband's threshold,
"But to be lifted over in memory
that the Sabine women
were carried in
by violence."
[Knock on door]
Who is it?
Benjamin.
What do
you want?
My leg
is feeling poorly.
I, uh... I need
some liniment.
Go ahead, but be
quick about it.
Yes, Milly.
"Some say, too,
"The custom of parting
the bride's hair with the head of
a spear was in token of... "
[Knock on door]
I... I got me
a stiff neck.
Now, that's enough
of this nonsense!
We just wanted to...
Go on out to the barn, all of you.
And go to sleep.
Or I'll bolt
the door on you.
"Was... was in token
of their marriages.
"It began at first by wars
and acts of hostility,
And then, uh...
Doesn't it do anything
But snow up here?
We've had a blizzard every day
for the past 2 months!
I'm going crazy,
shut up in this house.
Alice, why don't you
read out loud to us?
Oh, no.
Oh, we've heard that book
3 times already!
Yes, go on. Read us about
the sobbin' women!
- Please, Alice?
- I can't stand it again.
Then go get the dress
Milly promised you,
and I'll fit it to you.
What's the use when there's
no one to see it?
No one?
Well, I like that...
We're no one!
- Where's Milly?
- Out in the barn,
hunting eggs.
Oh, I wish I could
hunt eggs.
I love to hunt eggs.
Which of the boys slept
in this bed, do you suppose?
Dorcas Galen!
What's the matter?
Didn't you ever think of that?
That you're sleeping
in one of their beds?
Well, I certainly never
thought any such thing!
Liza, Alice! Come away from
that window this minute.
I think it's disgusting, standing
there where they can see you.
I notice that you peek out
often enough when you think
no one's looking.
- I never!
- I saw you!
So did I.
You take
that back!
Lisa and Alice!
Would you stop it!
Don't you dare say a thing
like that about Martha!
And what were you doing
last night out at the woodpile?
Oh, you!
Girls!
Now, stop!
Girls! Girls!
Stop it this minute!
Oh, girls, please,
don't squabble. Not now.
Not when I need you so much.
You see, I'm counting on all
of you to help me.
Because I'm gonna
have a baby.
Milly!
Oh, Milly, sit down!
Are you comfortable?
You feel fine?
You're not gonna
lift a finger from now on.
We'll take over
everything.
We'll do your chores,
cleaning, cooking, everything!
No, no, really, you can't.
That'd be silly.
- Where are you going?
- Well, I have a few things to do.
Milly, when's
the baby coming?
Well, you have
to be patient.
But when?
In the spring.
Oh!
I wish it was me.
Dorcas!
I always wanted to
be a June bride.
And have a baby
right off.
In the spring, maybe.
# Oh, they say
when you marry in June
# You're a bride
all your life
# And the bridegroom
who marries in June
# Gets a sweetheart
for a wife
# Winter weddings
can be gay
# Like a Christmas
holiday
# But the June bride
hears the song
# Of a spring that lasts
all summer long
# By the light
of the silvery moon
# Home you ride
# Side by side
# With the echo
of Mendelssohn's tune
# In your hearts
as you ride
# For they say
when you marry in June
# You will always
be a bride
# The day
a maiden marries
# Is the day she carries
through the years
# The church
is full of flowers
# Bridal showers are passé
# The groom's waiting
at the altar
# Here comes the bride
# They're each promising
to love and obey
# Best man is celebrating
# Every bridesmaid's waiting
just to see
# Which one of them will catch
the wedding bouquet
# For they say
when you marry in June
# You will always
# Always be a bride
# In November,
the snow starts to fly
# Piling up ankle-high
# Come December,
it's up to your knee
# Still the bride's
a bride-to-be
# January, higher still
# To the parlor
windowsill
# February finds a drift
# And a storm that seems
never to lift
# March comes in
like a lion, what else
# Still the snow never melts
# April showers will come,
so they say
# But they don't
# And it's May
# You're about to forget
the whole thing
# All at once
# One day, it's spring
[Sheep bleats]
# Oh, the barnyard is busy
in a regular tizzy
# And the obvious reason
is because of the season
# Ma nature's lyrical
with her yearly miracle
# Spring, spring, spring
# All the henfolk
are hatchin'
# While their menfolk
are scratchin'
# To ensure the survival
of each brand-new arrival
# Each nest is twittering,
they're all baby-sittering
# Spring, spring, spring
# It's a beehive of budding
son and daughter lives
# Every family
has plans in view
# Even down in the brook,
the underwater life
# Is forever
blowing bubbles, too
# Every field wears a bonnet
with some spring daisies on it
# Even birds of a feather
show their clothes off together
# Sun's getting shinery
to spotlight the finery
# Spring, spring, spring
# From his aerie,
the eagle with his eagle eye
# Gazes down across
his eagle beak
# And affixin' his lady
with a legal eye
# Screams, "suppose we set
the date this week"
# Yes, sirree, spring discloses
that it's all one supposes
# It's a real bed of roses,
wagging tails, rubbing noses
# Each day is Mother's Day,
the next is some other's day
# When love is king...
Frank, Dan, Ben, Caleb!
Everybody!
Milly's having
her baby! Come on!
Oh!
Liza, Martha,
Ruth, hurry!  Hurry!
[Footsteps]
[Slapping]
[Baby crying]
I'm an uncle.
[Crying]
Adam! Adam!
Hey, Gideon!
Couldn't stand
the barn any longer, eh?
I've come to get you, Adam...
Take you back with me.
Yeah?
Well, Milly
has a baby.
It come
day before yesterday.
I don't
believe it.
Well, it's as true
as I'm standing here.
I don't believe it!
Just one of her tricks
to get me back.
Trick?
Why, you lived with Milly
as man and wife, but you don't
know nothing about her.
She's got pride
and she's spunky.
Why, she'd never bring herself
to ask you back.
She'd be wasting
her breath.
I don't figure I go.
Not even
to see the baby?
Your own kin?
Your own little girl?
A girl?
I might've known.
She'd have a girl.
Now, I'll be back when
the pass is open.
I'll stay away till
the shooting's over.
- Adam?
- Hmm?
You're my eldest brother.
I've always looked up to you,
tried to ape you.
But today,
I'm ashamed for you.
Now, I know you can lick me,
lick the tar out of me,
But I wouldn't
hold myself no kind of man
unless I showed you how I felt.
Why, you...
Now git!
[Clanging]
The pass is open!
The pass is open!
All able-bodied men,
gather at the meeting house!
Bring your rifles,
your sides, your guns, axes,
any kind of weapon!
The pass is open!
The pass is open!
Are you ready, men?
- Yeah!
- Let's go!
# La da dum dum,
la da dum dum #
# La da da da da
da da da dum #
# La da dum dum,
la da... #
Ah, Gideon!
Well, what are you
staring at?
I told you I'd be back
when the pass was open.
The pass?
Oh, Milly!
They'll kill them!
Go upstairs, girls.
Go on, quickly.
Frank:
Let's get the guns.
Tell them to hitch up
the wagon.
Wagon?
Put plenty of blankets
and straw in it. Go ahead.
Uh... What do you
call her?
Well, I was thinking
of some name like...
Hannah or Hagar
or Hephzibah...
Picking up where
your mother left off.
Hannah.
Hannah.
I got to thinking up there
in the mountains...
Thinking about the baby...
About how I'd feel if
somebody came sneaking in
and carried her off.
I'd string him up
the nearest tree...
Shoot him down like
I would a thieving fox.
I thought about you, too,
while I was up there.
Seemed like I couldn't
get you off of my mind.
Milly, when
you're in love...
When you're really
in love...
The wagon's
ready, Adam.
All right.
Now get the girls.
I'm gonna take them back.
Back to
their families.
Oh, Adam.
Adam, you will
be careful.
We're not letting you
take 'em back, Adam.
We talked it over amongst us
and we're all agreed.
- They ain't going.
- They're our girls now.
I say I'm taking
them back.
I'm still head
of this family.
And I reckon you'll
have to show me.
Likewise.
What do I have to do,
beat some sense into
your dumb heads?
Don't you know taking
them back is the only way
you're ever going to get them?
- The whole town is
coming up here!
- Let them come!
We'll fight them all.
Sure, sure you will.
And who will you be fighting?
The girls' kinfolk!
Someone's bound to get hurt...
A father, brother, maybe.
Think the girls are gonna
marry you after that?
Adam's right.
I stand
with Adam.
Well, don't stand
too close.
Adam! Adam,
the girls have gone!
They've run away!
Go get them! Get them back!
Come on, come on.
Hyah!
Yah!
Dorcas! Come back!
You'll get hurt!
Fellas, keep it quiet.
They can hear us from here.
We'll creep up
on them.
Alice!
- Please, Alice!
- Hey Martha, where are you?
Come back, Martha.
Don't run away.
Aah!
Aah!
I'm not going back!
I'm not going back!
I want to stay here
with you!
You've got to!
It's the only way!
It's Alice!
Come on, Ruth!
Aah!
[Women screaming]
Hey!
There they are!
Aah!
Hey!
- Stop!
- Put me down!
Aah!
Aah! Let me go!
Aah! No!
Don't! You'll
hit Dorcas!
[Women screaming]
[Baby crying]
[Baby crying]
Oh, no.
Not that!
Grab her dress, Ben!
Get a ladder!
Ruth! Ruth!
Why, pa!
Sarah...
Let me out...
Alice...
Oh! Oh!
Get up, Pontipee!
Oh, what are you
going to do to him?
We're gonna hang him
with the rest of them
from the nearest tree.
Oh!
Oh, no!
Just a minute!
Before we go, there's
one thing we've got to know
from our girls.
Girls! Girls!
Now, reverend, what is it
you want to know?
We're all fathers here,
and we love you,
So don't be afraid
to answer.
A while back I heard
a wee babe crying in the house.
Whose is it?
Whose is it?
Don't be afraid to tell.
Mine!       Mine!       Mine!
Do you, Alice, Ruth, Martha,
Liza, Sarah, Dorcas,
take these men to be your
lawfully wedded husbands?
- We do.
- We do.
And do you, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel,
Ephraim, Frankincense, Gideon,
take these girls to be your
lawfully wedded wives?
- We do.
- We do.
I now pronounce you
men and wives.
