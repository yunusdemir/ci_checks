You're not cold
or anything, are you?
Everything all right?
Are you taking any medication?
Hmm?
Thank you.
How are you doing this morning?
Did you have a restful sleep last night?
Oh, yeah.
- You did?
- I did.
And your dreams?
Nope.
Sometimes we don't
remember our dreams, you know?
That's right.
We do dream, but we don't
remember when we wake up.
But if we are dreaming some just
before we wake up, we remember those.
That's right.
Did you know...
A little, uh,
useful information.
Yeah.
When we wake up and say,
"The whole night, I was dreaming
this and that and everything,"
it's only 45 minutes maximum.
Did you know that? Yeah.
No, I did not. Yeah.
So the ordinary dream
is 10 or 15 minutes.
I'll see you all later.
Where are you going?
I'm going to see my patients.
Testing. Testing. Check, check, check.
One, two, three.
Testing. One, two, three.
We are now at Smith's Grove,
uh, rehabilitation facility.
We're here today
to interview a patient
that's spent the last
40 years in captivity
and, by all accounts, has not
uttered a word. This monster...
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
I'm Dr. Ranbir Sartain.
Great to finally meet you.
Thank you so much for taking the
time to meet with us today.
We were hoping
to have this opportunity
before he's transferred
to the new facility.
Glass Hill is far less
accommodating.
Glass Hill is the pit of hell.
For years, he's been
kept here to be studied.
I suppose the state has lost interest
in discovering anything further.
Well, that's why we're here.
Michael has been
my life's obsession.
I've examined every single
case file written on him.
I was a student of Dr. Loomis'
before he passed away.
And then I lobbied
the University of Illinois
to be assigned
to Michael myself.
Any progress?
Well, he's been seen by over
50 clinical psychiatrists,
and with each,
many different opinions.
Dr. Loomis was the only one
to see him in the wild.
And he concluded he was
nothing more than pure evil.
Our patients get fresh air, sunshine, a
view, proper exercise, healthy diet.
It pains me to see him transferred to
that less-than-desirable facility.
And there he is.
He can speak.
He just chooses not to.
I'd love to stand
closer to him, if I may.
Get a sense of his awareness,
or lack of awareness.
Oh, make no mistake, he's aware.
He was watching you
as you arrived.
Perhaps you'd like
to tie your left shoelace?
Mr. Tovoli here, the
gentleman with the umbrella,
has a fixation for such things.
Underestimate no one.
Of course.
And now step up
to the yellow line.
And no further.
Do not cross the line
under any circumstances.
Michael.
Michael.
I've got some people
who'd like to meet you.
Hello, Michael.
My name is Aaron Korey.
I've been following your case for years
and still know very little about you.
I'd like to know more.
About those involved.
Do you ever think
about them, Michael?
Feel guilt about their fate?
I borrowed something from a friend at
the attorney general's office, Michael.
You feel it, don't you, Michael?
You feel the mask.
Figaro. Figaro!
Say something, Michael.
Say something.
You can feel it, can't you?
It's a part of you, Michael.
It's a part of you.
Say something.
Say something, Michael.
Say something!
What is it we're after?
Okay, well,
having witnessed the animal
in its captive state
and failed to provoke
any sort of response,
we now track down
its counterpart.
Could it be that one monster
has created another?
And although the iron bars
and barbed wire
that separate them
are both strong and sharp,
the metaphysical lines
are blurred and slight.
Both exist in isolation,
fettered by their own fear
- and hatred of one another.
- This one.
Here?
Could it be that the only hope
of rehabilitation...
Spooky.
Is through confrontation?
"Access has been denied. Private property.
No trespassing."
You might need this.
Dana, journalists don't pay
for their interviews.
Smile. We're on camera.
Yes.
Hello. Um...
We're looking for Laurie Strode.
We're, um...
We're making a podcast, and...
We're investigative journalists.
If you have a moment, we've
traveled a very long way.
How does $3,000 sound?
Hello.
May we come in,
and sit down and talk?
So...
Aaron and I have made several
award-winning public radio exposes.
Our last project shed new light on
a murder case from 20 years ago.
We like to reexamine incidents
with an unbiased lens.
I believe there's a lot to learn
from the horrors you experienced.
There's nothing to learn.
There are no new insights
or discoveries.
So, is he real?
Who?
The Boogeyman.
I read you quoted... You don't
believe in the Boogeyman?
I believe in Michael Myers,
deranged serial killer,
but the Boogeyman, no.
Well, you should.
Okay.
Michael Myers is a human being
who killed his sister
when he was six years old.
Then he came after you.
We just want to know why. We
want a glimpse inside his mind.
That's why your story
is so important.
My story?
Two failed marriages.
Rocky relationship with your
daughter and granddaughter.
And he's a human being
we need to understand?
I'm twice divorced.
And I'm a basket case.
They're transferring him.
Tomorrow, 7:00.
He'll be locked away
until the end of his days.
That's the idea.
Let's talk about when the state
came to take your daughter away.
She was 12 years old. They
said you were an unfit mother.
How long until
you regained custody?
I didn't.
But you already knew that.
Laurie, we saw him.
We met with Michael.
I showed him the mask.
There was nothing.
No response. Nothing.
He won't talk to anyone.
Never has,
but I think he might
speak with you.
So, why don't
you sit down with him
and say all the things
you must be longing to say?
Come with us, and let us
help you free yourself.
Please.
Time's up.
I'll accept my payment.
Get out.
You want to shit under my sink?
I will murder you
and your whole family.
I switched from marshmallow
fluff to peanut butter.
See if those little bastards
eat that.
That ought to kill them.
Morning.
I rescheduled my last session,
so I can make it tonight.
You really didn't have to do that, Mom.
It's not a big deal.
You made it into
the National Honor Society.
Yeah.
That is a very big deal.
I just made it to the top
of my shop class,
making birdhouses and a
checkerboard made of teak.
We're excited to meet Cameron.
That whole family, though,
they had a reputation.
Ray, come on. But it's true.
It's a relevant factor.
Ray. Ray.
Do you remember the one time Lonnie
punched that cop in the face?
- Ray.
- That was a...
Oh! Mother...
Oh, man! I got peanut
butter on my penis.
Ew, Dad.
Instant karma.
Cameron is a good guy.
He's nothing like that.
You're gonna see
when you meet him tonight.
They're all nice guys
until they get you pregnant,
and then you gotta drive
in their pickup trucks,
and you clean their guns,
and you got children,
and you clean guns, and you
like to get high with them,
and then y'all get fat.
Hey, Dad?
What?
Can you stop?
I gotta clean this peanut
butter off my hand.
Did you invite Grandmother
like you said you would?
About tonight. You said
that you'd invite her.
Oh. Right. I did.
You did?
Yeah.
I talked to her yesterday.
She's not gonna be able
to come, honey. I'm sorry.
Really?
Yeah.
Baby, she's agoraphobic.
She needs cognitive behavioral
therapy, so don't take it personally.
That's Vicky. I gotta go.
Hey, I love you.
Have a good day.
- Bye, Dad. Love you.
- Okay.
- So, my mom's a liar.
- Whathappened?
She said that she invited my
grandmother tonight, but she didn't.
I mean, she never
even contacted her.
How do you know?
Because I called her myself.
That's bullshit.
Yeah.
Dude, what's your mom's deal?
Why would she say that?
I don't know. She just tries
to keep me away from her.
Everyone in my family, like,
turns into a total nutcase
this time of year.
If I were you guys, I
wouldn't celebrate, either.
I would just put up
a Christmas tree instead.
Just skip all over the creepy
Halloween shit, right?
Does your grandma
ever talk about it?
Yeah, it's pretty much
all she talks about.
It defines her life.
She's been traumatized
ever since.
Wasn't it her brother who, like,
cold-blooded murdilated
all those teenagers?
No. That's just a bit that some people
made up to make them feel better, I think.
I mean, that is scary to
have a bunch of your friends
get butchered by some
random crazy person.
Is it, though? Because,
all things considered,
there's a lot worse stuff
that's happening today.
And, like, I mean, what,
a couple people getting killed
by one guy with a knife
is not that big of a deal.
Dude, her grandmother
was almost fucking murdered.
And she escaped, and they caught
him, and now he's incarcerated.
I'm just saying, like,
by today's standards...
Just shut the fuck up,
Dave. Shut up.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, shut up, Dave.
Hey, is it cool with you guys if I
explode one of these pumpkin heads?
Yeah. Yeah.
Go for it.
Oh, he's serious?
He's serious. Oh, God,
he's really blowing it up.
I know. He's such
a fucking moron.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus.
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Happy Halloween!
Ah!
Cameron. I got you.
That was a good one.
Yes, that was very good.
Hey, do you have everything for
your costume tomorrow night?
Bonnie and Clyde must
roll as one, after all.
Um, no, I mean, I'm more
focused on tonight.
Tonight?
I thought you were joking when you
said your parents were old-fashioned.
Be nice, okay?
Okay.
It'll be fun.
I'm excited for tonight.
I need to calm down.
I'm excited for tonight, okay?
Okay.
Ooh... Ugh!
Ugh. You guys
are just barf, you know.
You're just...
You're two yucky dumpsters,
and I want to go diving.
Come here. No.
Dude, dude.
Right here, right here, right?
Oh. Mwah. Mwah. Dude, you got
your little chapped-lip crusties
all over me, man, so thanks.
I know.
And you're welcome.
It's gross. It's a little
part of me for you.
For the rest of your day.
All right?
So, do you have everything ready
for your costume tomorrow?
Um...
- About that...
- What?
Are we seriously not?
You said we were gonna do this
whole Halloween dance together,
and now you just ditch me.
I mean, you just... You can't walk
all over town breaking hearts.
Okay. Hey, listen, listen.
All right?
Love. Truly.
Okay, lovebirds, later.
Now let's open our books
to Frankl's interpretation.
He said, "Fate took
a different course."
"I understand how someone who
has nothing left in this world"
"may still know bliss."
His message is totally hopeful.
Even in the most disparaging of
conditions, life can find its meaning,
and conversely,
so can one's suffering.
I can't accept this.
Use it for whatever
your heart desires.
I'll save it for college then.
Fuck college. Go somewhere.
Go to Mexico.
Could you imagine?
Yeah, I can.
Look, don't worry
about your mom.
She will freak,
but she'll get over it.
Why can't you?
The Boogeyman?
All this hiding, all this
preparation, it was for nothing.
I mean, it took priority over your family.
It cost you your family.
If the way I raised your mother
means that she hates me,
but that she's prepared
for the horrors of this world,
then I can live with that.
Say goodbye to Michael,
and get over it.
Goodbye.
Dr. Samuel Loomis,
January 22, 1979.
Do you wish to give a statement regarding
your former patient, Michael Myers?
My suggestion is termination.
Death is the only solution
for Michael.
A2201. Myers, Michael.
There '5 nothing to be gained
from keeping evil alive.
A22...
A shot of sodium thiopental
would render him unconscious.
I 'II be with him to make sure
his life is extinguished.
My ear on his chest to hear for myself
that his vitals no longer function,
and immediately
incinerate the body.
It needs to die.
It needs to die!
It needs to die!
Don't worry, Michael.
I'll be by your side.
Michael Myers is still my patient
until he's in somebody else's care,
so I'm seeing my duty
through till the end.
All right, move out.
Send my DNA away to a stranger.
Why not? You can find out some
pretty interesting things.
Don't... I found out
that I'm part Cherokee.
I guess my dad's,
like, 7% Cherokee.
I know Lonnie. I went to
high school with him.
- He used to sell me peyote.
- Dad.
- Everyone knows Lonnie.
- Yeah.
Dad.
I'm sorry.
Um, this is a massive
overshare for our new friend.
No, he did. I learned a lot
about myselfwith his dad.
Tripped balls out in the
woods, me and his dad.
Boy, Ray...
Tripping balls.
No, really, keep talking.
So, you guys have big plans for
tomorrow at the high school?
What are you doing?
- Is it a dance or something?
- Yeah, it's a Halloween...
- Costumes?
- Halloween dance. Yep.
Costume party.
What are you going as?
Uh, well, I don't know
if I'm allowed to say.
- Please say.
- Oh, come on.
- I can... Okay.
- Come on.
So we're going
as Bonnie and Clyde.
- Oh, that's a great idea.
- Yeah.
Except...
Oh!
Ooh. Oh. No. Okay, so
just Bonnie and Clyde.
That's it. Bonnie and Clyde.
Bonnie and Clyde with a twist.
- Classic.
- Yeah!
I love that.
Nice.
That's so fun.
You'll see.
You know how it ended, right?
Their story ended a little...
Yes. Hopefully...
Yes, with the bullets
and the bleeding.
Yeah.
You have a jalopy filled with
bullet holes from the G-men?
I wish we had one of those.
It was in Laughlin, like a Model A.
I know.
Did you talk to Grandmother?
Yeah.
She said she was gonna come. She came
to my office. We had a nice talk.
Did you? Really?
That's a first.
It was nice.
Oh. Do you know
where she is then?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I... That part... Oh.
Great timing, Mom. Hi. l...
You made it.
It ran late. I'm sorry.
Hi. I'm so happy you came.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Laurie.
- Hi. Hi. I'm, uh...
- Hi.
I'm the grandmother.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Cameron Elam.
And we're here celebrating our
daughter because of her...
Yes, I know.
How did it go?
Yes. It looks good on you. You know,
I was in the Honor Society, too.
That's good. Why don't you
sit down, Mom?
No, I'm good.
Yeah, have a seat.
Or we could go for a walk,
if you'd like.
Really? Did it go great?
Yeah? Yeah.
It went really...
It went, um...
- Hey, Mom?
- That's mine.
I thought you quit drinking.
Mmm!
Mom, what are you doing?
What is this?
You know, this is exactly
why we don't reach out.
Mom.
I'm sorry.
I will sit down.
Okay.
Why don't we press the reset button?
Why don't we just start over, okay?
All right, Mom...
- Sorry.
- Mom.
Please stop this.
Sorry.
I saw him.
The Shape.
Mom...
I wanted to kill him.
Okay, that's enough, Laurie.
Laurie, that's enough.
I didn't know what to do.
- That's enough, Laurie.
- Okay.
I think maybe this is a little
bit too much for you, huh?
Why don't we go
for a walk, all right?
You said you were gonna try
to put the past behind you.
Laurie.
Okay? Are you gonna try to do that?
That's what you said you wanted to do.
I can't. Mom, look at me.
Look at me.
- I...
- Should we, uh...
Really hate to say
I told you so, but...
I'm glad you got to see that.
I never told you
how I spent my childhood.
Gotcha.
I learned how to shoot a gun
when I was eight.
I learned how to fight.
I had nightmares
about the basement.
Social Services came when I was
12 years old and took me away.
I've spent my entire life
trying to get over the paranoia
and neuroses that she has
projected on me.
Yeah, he reminds me
of, uh, Gary Hogeboom.
Yeah, that quarterback
thing is all messed up.
Good times, right?
What is she gonna do
with herself?
I know. It's not
your job to save her.
She'll be all right.
I can't get reception
on this thing
ever since the antenna
was bent at the car wash.
Why do we have to come out again?
We do this all the time.
What? You don't enjoy it? I like
being out in the woods and...
No, I enjoy it, but I'm
missing dance class for this.
And sometimes I would rather
do that than hunting.
I mean, is dance class
that important to you?
Yeah, it is.
You need some more time
in the woods to go
hunting and fishing. No.
On weekends,
I'll do it with you, Dad.
Like, I really love
spending time with you,
but right now dancing
is my thing, you know,
and it really hits me
in the heart. I mean, I...
Dad, look out!
Oh!
What the hell
happened to you, hoss?
Oh, shit.
Dad, look.
Lumpy, you stay here.
I'm gonna make sure
no one's hurt.
You call the police.
Okay.
Dad, be careful, please.
Hey, you fellas okay?
You all right?
911.
What is the emergency?
Yes. Um, there's
been an accident.
Uh, there's a bus. People
running around in the road.
My dad went to look.
I don't know.
Okay. Hold on.
I'll go check.
Dad?
Run.
Wait here. I'll go get my dad.
No.
Run!
Dad!
Daddy!
Don't shoot. Aah!
Oh, fuck!
Fuck!
"Don't need a credit card
to ride this train."
Yo, Hawk, listen.
The ball come down loose,
that's where you're gonna mess up at.
Yo, Hawkins, would you like
a strawberry slushie
or a blue raspberry slushie?
Can you just bring me a coffee, will you?
I'll get you back later.
Pull a slingshot, it'll go
straight down the middle.
But you ain't never gonna beat my score,
so it makes no difference what you do.
Say that again.
You're never gonna beat my score, so it
doesn't make no difference what you do.
Dispatch to unit 601. We have
a 10-50 on Marlow Road.
Copy that, dispatch.
I'm on my way.
- Attention, all units.
- We got an officer that's 10-23
and a possible 10-50
on Route 20. Will advise.
Sheriff's Department.
Possible 10-98. Over.
If you need assistance,
let yourself be known.
Signal 13.
Officer down.
I repeat, officer down.
I need assistance.
Send backup right away.
Uh, roger that. 10-1, officer down.
Sending EMT and all available units.
Ooh!
Show your hands!
I've been shot.
All right, stay with me.
Help's on the way.
What happened in here?
Did he escape?
Who?
Did who escape?
Well, I got a cousin works at a
graveyard not too far from here.
They got war generals,
philanthropists, a beatnik poet.
They got Muddy Waters.
Oh, and they got Bernie Mac.
People come from all over
to pay respects.
But this is Haddonfield, and
this is our only claim to fame.
Maybe you can explain to me what's
so special about Judith Myers.
As she sat combing
her hair, unaware,
her 6-year-old brother crept in
quietly with a kitchen knife.
He then proceeded to slice
the base of her skull,
scraping her spinal cord.
When she turned, raising
her hands in self-defense,
he continued stabbing
into the nerves and arteries
of her palms.
Three more stabs into her
sternum, penetrating her heart.
Hawkins.
Still checking IDs
of the patients we recovered
to figure out who's who.
Almost all accounted for.
Two of them were checking their
emails at a local library.
Just found three of them
holding hands,
chasing butterflies
at a flea market off the 220.
Butterflies? Still no idea
what really went down.
Any word from Mr. Rip
Van Winkle over here?
Nurses say he's been in and
out, lost a lot of blood.
Somehow managed
to fall on a bullet.
I'm trying to get the whole story
because here's my concern.
Take a look at this list.
Most of them minor
offenders, mental patients.
One stuck out. A2201.
It's Michael Myers.
Babysitter Murders, 1978.
Forty years to this day.
Michael Myers loose
with a bunch of nutbags
in Haddonfield
on Halloween night?
We're gonna have a fucking
circus on our hands.
But hey.
What are we gonna do?
Cancel Halloween?
Dr. Ray,
please pick up line two.
I need to go to a numbertwo
almost immediately.
Can I drive? Come on, get in the car.
Move it.
Want anything from the shop?
No. No, thank you.
Hmm.
Where's the loo?
Excuse me?
Bathroom.
It's out that way,
around the back.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Someone's in here.
Hello?
What the...
Help me!
Help me!
Aaron!
Get off me!
Aaron! Stop!
Help me!
Michael.
Aaron! Aaron!
DanalNo!
Dana!
Police have not determined
a cause of this accident.
This scene's still
very active, of course.
You can see the police tape
set up behind me.
That prison bus firmly down
in that ditch.
You can see the tow truck, of course, that
is trying to get that prison bus out.
A source tells us that bus
was transporting personnel
from a local state hospital.
13 A-9.
Roger.
Ray?
Allyson?
Allyson? Is anyone home?
Karen?
Shh.
What?
Gotcha!
Jesus.
You're dead.
You scared me!
What are you doing in our house?
You mean, how did I get
into your house?
You have no security
system, Karen.
Your side window was wide open.
Sometimes I can't tell the difference
between your stupidity and your ignorance.
Hey, Laurie, this is my home,
and I can take care
of my own family, all right?
I knowjujitsu.
I have studied...
- The bus crashed.
- Ray.
What?
Look, I have a plan.
Where's Allyson? We need
to get out of here now.
What bus crashed?
Put down that gun. Put down...
Hey, hey. Back off!
Put down that gun. You're in my...
Put down the gun!
Mom, you need help,
and you are not welcome in
this house until you get it.
I have tried to protect you
and prepare you.
Now we have to hunt him down.
Yeah, and I am trying to
prepare dinner for my family.
The world is not
a dark and evil place.
It is full of love
and understanding,
and I'm not letting your
psychotic rants confuse me
or convince me otherwise.
Keep the gun.
No! You need to go.
Get out!
Son of a bitch.
Hawkins.
Frank!
Yeah?
Look at this.
It's a hospital gown.
State-issued.
Get on the phone to Smith's Grove.
Confirm the match.
You know I was there that night.
I was there.
We have one order of business.
That's to hunt this thing down.
There's a reason we're supposed
to be afraid of this night.
Trick or treat!
Which one should we go to?
They're all spooky.
I'm gonna pick that one
over across the street.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
What the... Sorry.
Hey. Sorry about that.
Black cats and goblins
and broomsticks and ghosts.
Covens of witches
with all of their hosts.
You may think they scare me.
You're probably right.
Black cats and goblins
on Halloween night.
Please!
Please let us out of here!
The other side.
You are the sign.
Trick or treat! Hey, guys.
Stay together.
Trick or treat, smell my feet,
give me something good to eat.
Wait, hang on, hang on.
- I don't have my stethoscope.
- Come on!
I need it. I'm gonna get it.
We're going to be late.
I'll be right back.
Jeez!
Look. You're not gonna believe this.
They were in my pocket the whole time.
Did Rebecca give you directions?
Yeah. She did call me.
Hey, Sally.
How are you?
Really?
That's awful.
Well, I'll keep my doors locked.
Thanks for telling me.
Billy's still out at a party.
Let me know if you hear
anything else.
Good night, Sally.
Trick or treat!
Bonnie and Clyde, you are lady-killers.
You guys are seriously beautiful.
You're seriously...
Give me a smile.
Give me a big smile.
Just hold her tight.
There we go. Do that.
Do that with your ass.
Okay, so, no, not... It's Vicky.
One second. One sec.
Okay, you don't have to take it.
Hi. Oh, my gosh,
I wish that you were here.
It is so much fun.
God, I wish I was there.
I'm so fucking bummed.
It's just, like, so much easier
to actually, like, talk to
people when you have no idea
who they are. Yeah, dude,
I told you you'd have fun.
How's Cameron? Is he looking super
fine in my grandma's skirt?
He is so sexy, it's a
little too much to take.
But...
Where'd you go?
No, he's so sweet.
I'm having the best time.
You know, you guys should just
come over here when it's done.
You know, the "Alakazam,"
if you know what I mean.
And Julian's parents aren't gonna
be back until, like, super late.
Okay, well, it is a school night, so
we're not gonna "kazam" too much.
Oh, come on. It's a "school night."
Don't be a needy bitch. Get over here.
Okay. I'll see you soon. We'll
come over as soon as it's over.
Okay, bye. Love you.
I heard you telling your
friends to come over here
and you're gonna smoke some weed.
No. No.
That "Alakazam"?
Julian, I'm talking about, like,
you know, like, a magic trick,
like, "abracadabra."
Mmm.
I know you're talking about
smoking weed. Don't lie to me.
That's against the rules.
I'm telling my mom.
Well, I'm gonna tell your mom
about your browser history.
You better not.
You can get me in trouble,
I can get you in trouble.
I'm.
You used to be my favorite,
but now you're,
like, my tenth favorite boy
that I nanny.
And I babysit
some fucking loser kids.
It! Had some other kind of babysitter,
she'd be reading me a story.
I wouldn't be up clipping
my nasty-ass toenails.
Uh-huh. Go to bed.
You used to be cool.
We used to be friends.
But now...
Okay.
Come on, go to bed.
Wait.
It's way past your bedtime.
You want to be a good kid?
Mmm-hmm.
Go to bed, go to bed.
How much do you get paid?
Come on, let's go, let's go.
I'll get ya. Come on.
Good night, little dude.
Hey, Vicky. Can you leave
the door open? Just a crack?
Yeah.
Good night.
By the way, you're actually
my favorite kid I babysit for.
I like you, too.
Good night.
That is not what...
Fuck.
Okay, that really...
That fucked me up. Okay.
Allyson!
Allyson, come here!
Wait. Hey, Allyson.
No. What was that?
Okay. What?
What was that? What's this?
What? Dude, have some
discretion, all right?
I don't know what you thought you saw,
but Kim literally was talking to me.
Really? She came up
to me and, like,
whispered in my ear, okay? You
don't have to cry about it.
It's not that big a deal.
So Oscar got you fucked up?
No, lgot...
I mean, lgot
me fucked up. I...
Okay.
Hey, okay, can we just talk?
Okay. Don't.
Okay, here,
you know what? No.
Your fucking precious phone?
What the fuck?
You gonna get that?
Or do you want me to get it?
Hold up, hold up.
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm done.
This is Unit 14.
I'm out by
Old Lady Miller's house.
I don't see anything
suspicious out here. Over.
Uh, 10-4. You want to go ahead
and show yourself code two,
officially cancel request
for assistance?
Uh, affirmative. Over.
Oh, shit.
Sorry.
Hi.
I didn't want to ring the
doorbell and wake up the kid.
It's okay. Check it out.
Fresh from my patch.
Oh, my God.
His eyes are hearts.
I love it.
Yeah.
This is Tate.
Hello. Hi, Tate.
Hello. What's up?
Hi. How are ya?
Do we have
the whole house to ourselves?
Is that how this works?
Yes.
Sweet. Until Allyson
and Cameron get here.
Okay, so, in the meantime,
you want to make some popcorn
and watch a spooky movie?
Mmm, no. All right,
wait, check this out.
You're gonna like this.
I went and got this tattoo.
Because tonight is the night,
the one we'll remember
for the rest of our lives.
You are so getting
dry-fucked tonight.
Oh, yeah?
Fucking come here.
What?
What was that?
What was what?
Did you hear something?
No. What was it?
I don't know. I thought I heard,
like, a noise or something.
Yeah, it's probably just
Julian taking a dump.
Would you go look?
Do I have to?
Yeah, would you please go look?
Okay.
It was weird.
All right.
All right, little buddy.
Oh, fuck me.
I saw someone in the hallway,
standing outside my door.
Oh.
What's up, buddy?
There was a fucked-up face,
watching me from the dark.
Ghosts and goblins,
little buddy?
Shut up, Dave! I heard him
breathing, and then I saw him.
He's in here.
Boogeyman's in this house.
Okay. All right.
Come on, I got you.
Let's check it out.
Send Dave first.
No, it's fine. It's fine.
No, no. No, it's not.
It's okay. Come on.
No, it's not.
Come on, show me where
you saw Boogeyman.
I'll protect you. I'm strong.
I got you. No.
Vicky, you go up there first.
I'll fight him off.
Come on. I promise.
No.
- Can you call my mom?
- Yeah.
If there's something
in the room, I'll call her.
He was standing
right there in the door.
I'll check it out.
Excuse me, sir.
What are you doing in here?
Please, you need to leave.
Please leave.
Vicky?
Get out now!
Gotcha.
You fucking kidding me?
You're safe.
Nothing's in here.
You're sure?
Mmm-hmm.
You checked behind the curtains?
I checked the whole place.
Sick.
See? There's nothing to be afraid of.
There's no Boogeyman in here.
What if it's a doll?
Ooh, it could be, like, one of
those weird, like, kid dolls,
one of those weird babies,
and they stare at you
with those beady little eyes.
Oh, fuck.
Ah, Sharia.
Could you Close the closet door?
Yeah.
Oh, shit!
Oh, God.
No!
Oh!
Help! Dave! Help me!
Vicky!
Whoa!
Julian, run!
I'll go get help. Dave!
Dave! Vicky?
Get out of here!
Don't go up there!
You're gonna get killed, Dave.
Somebody help me!
Dave, help me!
Vicky.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No! No!
Fuck this.
All units, we have reports
of a domestic disturbance
at 707 Meridian Avenue.
Please respond. Over.
Copy that, Dispatch.
Okay, guys, don't forget
to say thank you.
Come on.
That's enough. No, come on.
No, they can have
a little more, honey.
Trick or treat, smell my feet,
give me something good to eat.
Haddonfield
Sheriff's Department!
Responding to
a domestic disturbance!
I repeat. This is Officer
Hawkins. Please respond.
Get out of here! Now!
Let's go, guys. Move.
Get inside!
Oh, fuck!
Michael!
Oh, shit.
Laurie. Fuck!
Jesus Christ, Frank!
Fuck me!
What the fuck?
What the hell
are you doing here?
Frank, he's here.
I know.
This way, please.
Look who's up.
Where is he?
You tell me.
The bus
lost control after Michael
overtook the first guard
and the driver.
He's no longer dormant.
He only knows how to keep
moving and to keep killing.
And he will kill again
unless he's captured.
Come with me for a minute.
You sit still.
Well, I was sitting still
anyway. What do you mean?
He's an asset.
He's not an asset. He's a liability.
No, no. He's on this hunt.
Nobody knows Myers
better than he does.
Oh, thank you.
You want me to take this injured
civilian to go look for
- a psychopathic serial killer?
- Sheriff.
Frank. What are we doing?
We don't need your help
right now, Laurie.
You're just standing here!
Please do something!
Excuse me, Officers.
Laurie Strode.
Laurie Strode,
meet Dr. Sartain.
I'm Michael's doctor.
Ranbir Sartain.
Oh, you're the new Loomis.
I read everything
about you and Michael.
Everything.
Did you know
our friend Hawkins here
was the first responding deputy when
Michael was apprehended in 1978?
He stopped Loomis from
killing Michael that night.
Do you know that I pray every
night that he would escape?
What the hell
do you do that for?
So I can kill him.
Well, that was
a dumb thing to pray for.
I'm sure he'll apologize.
He just needs to sleep it off.
Cameron doesn't want anyone
to see him as a bad guy,
but then he gets drunk
and gets belligerent
and looks like an idiot.
And then llook like an idiot
for vouching for him.
I'm really tired of everybody
letting me down all the time.
You deserve better.
Imean...
Allyson, you're the coolest,
you're the prettiest,
and you're the nicest girl
in school.
And if anyone doesn't appreciate
that, they're a crazy person.
Thank you.
That's very sweet.
Let's get out of here.
I know a shortcut.
From a clinical perspective, Doctor,
would you say that Laurie Strode
has lost her fucking marbles?
There are many ways for tragedy
and violence to change a victim.
They can grow accustomed
to always being afraid,
in constant fear.
They can grow weak,
they can grow strong.
But there's also the other side.
What other side is that?
The effect on the victimizer.
You see, this is what has
intrigued me through my studies.
How does a crime
like Michael's affect him?
Mmm-hmm.
What's that feeling?
Is he on a random path,
or is he emotionally driven?
Triggered by something?
Perhaps some unheard marching order
imprinted on his very being.
I want to know
what he's feeling.
I want to know what pleasure
he gets out of killing.
Where is this killer?
We gotta find him.
I'm not gonna stand in the
way ofjustice this time.
Remember, he's property
of the state.
He mustn't be harmed.
Oh, yeah?
We'll see about that.
It's not safe here.
Where's Allyson?
Where is she?
Where's Allyson?
Honey, it's Mom.
Can you please call me back the
second that you get this, please?
The police said that
they evacuated the dance,
and I can't get
in touch with you.
And they're making us go
to your grandmother's house
because it's safe...
Sweetheart, this is
your grandmother.
There is a police officer waiting
at your house to bring you to us.
We're all gonna be together.
Now, do as I say.
Oh, shit.
It's treacherous as hell here.
Okay.
You good?
Take my hand.
Okay.
Right here. This is the
dumbest shortcut ever.
Watch out for
all the poison ivy.
Don't let me fall on that.
All right. I got you.
I got you. Okay, I got you.
Okay, go.
Okay. You did it. Yay.
Good job.
Yay.
What are you doing?
I mean, you deserve better.
Right? I mean...
What the fuck?
What?
You're not with Cameron anymore.
That does not...
That does not mean
I want to be with you.
I thought you were
sending me signals.
Definitely no signals.
I'm so sorry.
Please, you cannot
tell Cameron about this.
I didn't feel anything,
either. I swear.
I didn't... Wait, I didn't...
You are so pathetic.
I'm going home. You can
figure your own shit out.
Who's there? What... Hey!
Motion sensor, dumb-ass!
Allyson, I'm, like, really
drunk right now. Seriously.
I got really horny
at the party, and, like,
all these girls were,
like, dancing on me.
Their beautiful bodies got me
all chubbed out, Allyson.
I... Allyson, please!
They, like... They were
feeding me guacamole
in all these sexy ways.
It's not my...
Happy Halloween,
Mr. Elrod. L'mjust...
I don't know, man.
I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to trespass
on your yard and shit, man.
I was just trying to take a shortcut
with a really pretty girl, and I just...
I just really like her, man,
and I thought
that she liked me, too.
And I just... ltjust...
Have you ever really liked a girl
and you just couldn't have her?
I'm... I'm sorry, man.
I'll just... I'll peace out
of your hair, man.
Thank you for...
Hey, uh, where'd you go,
man? You're acting...
Dude, you're acting, like, really
sketchy right now. I don't...
Uh...
What's up?
I'm leaving, right...
I don't...
I'm.
Ow! Oh, my God!
Help me! Help!
Please! Somebody!
Somebody, help me, please!
Somebody, please!
Please, somebody!
Somebody, please
help me! Please!
Please, somebody, help me!
Anybody! Anybody!
Oscar, come on.
Please, dear God!
Please! Please!
Help me! Help me! Help me!
Please help me!
Oscar!
Help! Let me in!
Let me in!
Help!
Somebody!
Help!
Help! Help!
Somebody! Please!
'Cause my daughter
is not calling.
It's safer for you...
She's not texting. Come on,
Karen, let's go inside.
Everyone's looking
for your daughter.
Let them take care of it. So
whoever you had looking for her
is obviously not able to
identify her.
We're gonna find your daughter.
It's Halloween.
We're gonna bring her here.
There are kids everwvhere.
Karen, come on.
There is no way.
Karen. Karen.
She had a costume, you know?
We need to go in the house. We
have everybody available...
In the last 40 years, okay?
Honey, if you let them do
their job, they're gonna...
Karen!
Just breathe. And if you
want, we can call someone...
Stay in the car, Doctor.
You all right?
Take deep breaths, sweetheart.
He's down the street.
Okay.
Okay. He's back. He
killed my friend.
Everything's gonna
be all right. It's Okay.
Take a deep breath.
We're gonna take you back
to your mom, okay?
I'm a doctor.
Lock your doors.
Everybody, get back to your
houses now and lock your doors.
We're gonna take you
to your mom.
Don't worry about him.
Don't worry about him.
Back in your houses now!
You heard the officer.
- What is going on?
- Back in your houses!
Lock your goddamn doors.
What's this?
It's my childhood.
Let's go.
All right, pick your poison.
I like a revolver.
They neverjam.
This is accuracy
and stopping power.
This is tactical.
He waited for this night.
He's waited for me.
I've waited for him.
Come on, Michael.
Allyson, keep your eyes open.
601.
He is out here somewhere.
Suspect reported on 11th,
near Saint Park.
Copy that, Dispatch.
I got eyes.
Look! It's him!
Here we go.
Brace yourselves.
Don't hit him!
- Watch out!
- Michael!
Don't shoot him.
Doctor, get back in the car.
No!
You killed him.
He's dead.
Stand back.
No.
I'm still gonna blow this
motherfucker's brains out.
Get away.
Leave my patient alone.
Get away from the body.
Stand back.
I'm not gonna say it again.
Step away from the suspect.
Step...
Fuck.
Help! Help! Help!
So this is what it feels like.
Help!
Make room for my patient.
No!
No!
These people want to kill this
man for the crimes you observed.
The most important opportunity to
understand the mind of evil, you see.
So, when he awakes,
we'll be ready.
Ready for what?
A reunion.
Michael's pursuit of Laurie Strode
could be what keeps him alive.
I would suspect
the notion of being a predator
or the fear of becoming prey
keeps both of them alive.
You want a banh mi sandwich?
A what? What is that?
A banh mi sandwich.
What's a...
What is that? I don't
even know what that is.
I love that about you, Francis.
You're so predictable.
You're like a PB and J
every day kind of guy.
Oh, here we go.
No, a banh mi sandwich.
Banh mi is essentiallyjust
the Vietnamese version
of a French baguette.
Mmm-hmm.
And the term actually refers
to the bread and not so much
the contents therein.
Mmm-hmm.
But your partner,
the greatest partner
in the world... Wow.
Made an arrangement with the
Vietnamese folks at the restaurant
and had them make you your very own
peanut butter and jelly banh mi sandwich.
That sounds disgusting.
I'm not gonna try that.
I brought my own food.
I'm very happy with my...
What did you bring?
You want to see what I brought?
Yeah, I do want
to see what you brought.
Ready? Look at this.
Look at that.
Fresh brownie.
Oh. Okay.
Chocolaty homemade brownie.
I made that myself.
That's, like,
what a 5-year-old would eat
if they could make
their own lunch.
I worked with Michael for years,
but I've never seen him in
an uncontrolled environment.
I've never heard him
speak, you see.
In spite of my encouragements,
he remains unresponsive.
But tonight, so many
possibilities exist.
He spoke to me.
He spoke to you? Yeah, um...
When he murdered my friend,
he saw me, and he spoke to me.
What did he say?
One word.
What?
Let me go, and I will
tell you what he said.
You must tell me. I must know.
You must tell me.
Let me go, and I'll tell you
what he said.
Just stop the car, and I'll
tell you what he said.
What is that?
That's weird, right?
Is that Hawkins?
I don't know.
What was the word?
Was it the sister's name?
Judith?
What was the word?
Fuck.
Michael.
606 to 601.
Hawkins.
Answer the fucking
radio, burnout.
Hawkins?
606, 601.
Hawkins, please respond.
Hawkins.
Let's go check it out.
All right.
Say something.
Can you see him?
Hawkins, please respond.
Hawkins, please respond.
Let's go and check it out.
All right.
Dispatch, be advised, we got
a man down. He's 10-7.
No sign of 601.
Karen, the lights.
What are you doing? I thought
you said we were safer here.
You never wanted to listen
when I spoke of that night.
And this is why.
I've been preparing for
this for a long time.
You want him to come here.
I'm so sorry, Karen.
I'm so sorry, baby.
Any word?
Hey, any word on Allyson?
Hey.
Guys.
What...
Ray!
Karen!
Where's Ray?
Michael's here.
Get downstairs.
Go, baby, go!
Mom!
Mom!
I was wrong to raise you the way I
did, but at least I can protect you.
Nothing will happen to you.
I know you thought
this was my cage.
I'm scared.
I have to finish this.
Mom.
I love you.
I love you, baby.
Come out, Michael.
Mom.
Grandmother?
Grandmother?
Baby.
Mom.
He's coming. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Where's Grandmother?
I couldn't...
I couldn't find you guys.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
I'm locked in a cage.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Everything's going to be okay.
Mom, I'm so sorry. I tried to
stop him from coming here.
Okay. Okay.
Stay back.
Get back!
Get back, get back.
Stay back.
Mom?
Help us!
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.
Gotcha.
Happy Halloween, Michael.
Come on, Allyson!
Come on, Allyson!
Allyson, go!
Allyson, come on!
Go!
Karen, come on, baby.
Come on!
Oh, God!
I got you!
Allyson, run!
Go! Go now!
Come on, kick him!
Allyson! Go!
Allyson, go!
Now go!
Okay. It's not
a cage, baby.
It's a trap.
Goodbye, Michael.
Oh, God, someone's coming.
Someone's coming.
Hold her.
I got her.
I got her. Go!
Go, baby, go!
Hey!
Help us.
