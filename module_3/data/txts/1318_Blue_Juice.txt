Smuggler FM.
That's a wonderful
new jingle, Gordon.
Someone's been busy
in the back room. Eh, Dan?
- Play it again?
- Why not?
Smuggler FM.
Smashing.
You know, Gordon...
- I hear an anecdote coming on.
- The other day, someone said to me...
"what's it like living in
the last county in England?"
And I said, "Cornwall’s not
the last county, it's the first."
Mmm... all right.
- Hey, what's that?
- That is our new window.
Our new window?
I just woke up and thought
a window would be great there.
Chloe, we're going
around the world...
we don't need
a new window.
JC... there's a sock
on your, um...
it's in mourning.
It's sad.
I mean, six weeks without love
is a very long time.
But, now, all that's over.
No more suffering.
Yeah?
No more back pain.
Just you and me...
and a whole lot of
catching up to do.
So, just lie back and relax.
And let the Jeepster
do the work.
Breakfast?
Breakfast?
Trifles sound good?
You are feeling better.
Hey...
Nice pinny.
Shhh!
What's going on?
- Surf.
- Surf?
Six foot and clean?
Come on!
Chloe...
you're going to kill me.
I've really screwed up.
I've got a lesson.
What, now?
Sorry.
The kids, they're...
waiting.
Crab, not again, man?
Moose, you dragged me out
of bed for this.
- He promised.
- It's coming.
Oh, shape.
Yeah, two weeks, four days
and every night.
- It's coming
- unbelievable.
What have you
got there, shape?
Hawaiian seaweed.
Call upon the gods
of the islands...
to send waves, sprinkle
it upon the water...
and chant the sacred
name of "makahee... kee".
How do you think
you say this?
Shape, please,
spare us the guru shit.
How many days good surf
do we get in Cornwall?
I don't know.
About one in ten.
- And how about Hawaii?
- Endless summer, man.
Yeah, can't wait.
One perfect barrel after another.
All right for you. What have we got
to look forward to?
Winter.
What a bummer.
We get gnarly waves.
When you've broken the ice.
Makaheekee. Makaheekee...
makaheekee... makaheekee...
makaheekee!
Makaheekee!
...smuggler fm.
All these young people seem
to want to leave in the winter.
It does get quite bleak,
round about.
Bleak's an awful strong word.
I won't hear bleak.
- "Damp", maybe then?
- "Fresh", I'll give you fresh.
Well, I've never been one
for foreign travel...
not with all the beauty
of Cornwall on my doorstep.
Well, it seems this young lady
is going all around the world.
And we wish Chloe well
on her trip to paradise.
Huh, with a special request
from someone called...
...the Jeepster.
Wait for it, remember I don't want
to see any dragging feet.
It's one clean movement, and...
paddle, paddle, paddle,
paddle, paddle, paddle...
up!
Yeah.
When are we going in the water?
Listen, this is really good practice
when there aren't any waves.
My mum paid you
to take me surfing.
First rule of surfing...
mellow out.
Hippy!
Hip-py! Hippy!
Chloe, that's... that's gonna burn.
I expect you had to tell the kids
your shark story.
- Chloe, it's burning, honestly.
- It's supposed to caramelize.
Yeah, it doesn't mean
napalm it, does it?
Look... really,
pass me the cream.
Got any of that syrup?
What?
Nothing.
What?
I just... er...
like watching you cook.
Yeah?
Nice pinny!
Out!
Okay, kids, what'll it be?
Trifle.
- Yeah!
- You're not old enough.
Sorry, only one portion left...
and I promised the great shark rider
that he could have it.
Yeah?
Yeah. Tonight.
And you'd better not have
any other plans.
Oh, no, no,
I'm... all yours.
Oh, I know, I know, JC,
it's been too long.
No worries, me and Josh
can handle it.
Yeah...
you, me, slim, Josh...
all the boys together again.
Yeah, all right.
Sweet.
See ya.
JC's up for it?
Of course. I told you
he would be.
- And he knows?
- Sure.
Do us a favor.
Bang that gong when I give you
a green light... yeah?
Yeah? Sweet.
Hard as you can.
A nice one!
Fuck...!
Are you having a go at me?
Just having a laugh.
"fuck...!"
Excellent.
Do I get royalties?
What if some townie jerk
buys this place?
- That's no drama, man.
- He's right, you know.
He'll probably turn it
into a captain Ahab’s theme bar.
Where are we gonna hang then?
Crab... man,
you're starting to stress.
Eighty-eight.
You did eighty-eight?
Eighty-eight.
What can I say, man?
You know... congratulations.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the new king of the pipeline.
Would the old king
like to present the crown?
Eighty-seven...
come on!
Dig in, go on!
Eighty-eight!
Come on, one more...
one more!
Eighty nine!
And still the king... yeah!
thought you hated the press.
It's for my mum, all right?
Now, I know what you wear's
important, Josh, so you choose.
Which balaclava...
green or blue?
He's dead.
They were only sleeping pills.
Just how many did you give him?
- Enough.
- How many's enough?
Enough.
Plus a couple of extra
to be on the safe side.
Yeah...
if we end up in court, remember,
you're the one who drugged him.
Relax, I work a lot
with pharmaceuticals.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have missed
your six years at medical school.
Look, I know what I'm doing.
The good stuff for my mates...
and flu pills
for the punters.
Told you he'd be all right.
I told you,
no stag night, Dean.
No getting pissed,
and no old stripper...
making me rub baby oil
into her pink bits.
- It's not a stag night.
- No?
We're going surfing.
Oh, my god!
You can do this.
You can do this.
Painkillers.
Yeah...
trifle?
I hope that's a 12-inch,
'cause this recipe takes forever.
And I want to hear you...
Beg!
please, Chloe...
I love it when you beg.
Don't just lie there...
I want to see wiggling.
Wiggling.
P- please, Chloe...
you'll have to do better
than that.
C- Chloe... please...
good!
But it's not good enough.
Chloe...!
What was that?
- I'm not stayin'.
- You're stayin', Terry.
You can't make me enjoy myself.
Oi, this is it.
Number thirty.
The lights are still on,
ring the bell.
Oh, no...
no need.
No!
Dean...!
It'll be all right.
Six weeks without sex.
But that didn't matter, just as long
as you stayed king of the pipeline.
Don't tell me...
it's going off!
- Oi... oi!
- Oh, my god!
Who the hell are they?
They're mates from London.
Dean:
Oi, JC!
- Chloe, I grew up with them.
- You never grew up!
He'll be packing his bag!
Told ya!
I'll take them to the caravan
and then I'll come straight back.
Don't bother.
What, you're throwing me out?
Oh, yeah, that's mature.
Yeah, go on, walk away!
Now you know how it feels.
You forgot something.
There's...
- there's a...
- there's a what, Josh?
There's a strawberry
sticking out of your shirt.
You can't beat this Cornish cream,
can you?
So, what...
you kidnapped him?
Well, it's the only way
we could get him away from his TV.
- Why couldn't we stay at her place?
- Well, 'cause his bird freaked.
She didn't freak, Dean.
She was a bit surprised...
with the "apocalypse now"
fireworks display.
I need a place to sleep
or I'm gonna get a migraine.
I've got a much better place,
Terry.
You're gonna love it.
Oh, god!
The property boom just sort of
passed you by, didn't it, JC?
Bastards! You kidnap me,
then you expect me to sleep
in this tin can
with my sinuses!
It's a lot bigger than it looks
on the inside, ter. I promise.
It's a bit like... you know,
like the tardis.
I can't sleep here!
One life! No fear!
Why did we ever
split up, man?
- Our musical differences.
- Musical inabilities.
I can't believe
slim used to play the drums.
Whatever happened to him?
Running that pub. Thinks it'll fall down
if he leaves it for ten minutes.
And now he's getting married.
Well, he has to, hasn't he?
Fit in with his timetable.
"I'm nearly thirty,
time to get married."
Well, you're as young
as you feel, right?
- You got any more coat hangers?
- What?
How many clothes
do you need, Josh?
We don't all want to look
like an agricultural laborer.
So, what's the problem
with your bird?
No problem, Dean.
Just try calling next time.
I thought you called.
Why do you always have to make
a meal out of everything?
We're here, aren't we?
Here... have a beer.
Remember the first time
we came down?
Yeah... just finished school.
You nicked your dad's van.
You stood up first time...
total natural.
Now you're off 'round the world.
You've got it sussed, guy.
Yeah. One life...
no fear.
Yeah, live for today!
...smuggler fm.
Now, it's time to join young bob,
who's at the county livestock show.
Bob:
I am, Gordon...
and one of the farmers
has just told me to expect rain...
'cause all his heifers
are lying down.
Well, the forecast is sunny
with cloudy spells.
His cows are lying down.
My old mum used to swear
by thistle dew.
I remember an old boy saying to me,
"frog spawn's best way of telling."
Well, I'm sure our listeners
will want to...
Terry's done a runner!
What?
He won't get far, man.
So, he took the bike.
He has to go west.
Well, it's the only way
out of here.
Problem is, though,
it's gone half seven.
It's milking time.
So...
he doubles back, you see,
and takes the path to the left.
Now, he... he could go right,
but that's uphill.
Terry's a fat git...
so he takes the path
of least resistance.
Downhill all the way.
Now, you see, he realizes
there's no turning back...
there's no stopping.
Which means I reckon
he's gonna end up...
right here.
Right, since it's nearly eight o'clock
and the tide's coming in...
he's gonna be cut off.
There's only one road in...
one road out...
we can't miss him.
- Morning, Terry.
- Morning, Terry. You're up early.
Bastards!
Well, it's not exactly, er...
California, is it?
Where's the sand?
There isn't any sand, Terry.
It's reef.
Goes all the way
out to sea.
You've just fallen onto
the best break in England, Terry.
Excellent... snap.
Looks flat to me.
It takes a massive storm
to set it off.
The swell...
it rushes in...
then, smacks against the rock...
and, boom!
Biggest waves
you've ever seen, man.
You see, the wave...
it sucks up all the water...
so you miss your take-off...
it's gonna slam you
straight into the slab.
We call it,
"the boneyard."
The boneyard?
If I don't eat soon,
I'm gonna get a migraine.
Twelve foot.
All time classic wave.
Twelve foot?
Wow... that's... big.
I sense doubt.
No, no, no...
if you say it was twelve foot,
then it was twelve foot.
Is there a system
for measuring waves...
like a Pythagoras triangle thing
or something...
'cause you were pretty specific
about twelve foot.
- It was twelve foot, all right?
- Yeah, twelve foot.
- All right.
- That's, er... 3.6 meters.
- Hi, man.
- All right, Essex?
- All right, man?
- How are you doing?
- Good, yeah.
- How are you? All right?
You're really a face, JC.
Oh, yeah. Just... just remember
I live here, all right?
What, you think
we're gonna embarrass you?
No. Just don't ask
for any beach boys records...
and don't try using
any surf-speak.
All right?
- Flat, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Can you just...
sit down, Dean?
Sit down,
take a look at a menu.
I've just gotta go and sort
some business out, all right?
Crab...
what are you doing?
Chloe had to nip out.
Man:
Oi, Crab, where's my food?
That's my pinny.
Have you seen this?
"A little bird tells me,
record producer Josh Tambini...
seems to have scored another hit
with supermodel Carla.
Let's hope his next hit doesn't come
from her heavyweight boxer husband."
I mean, where do they get
these stories?
Another one for your mum's
scrapbook, Josh.
Everything's a joke,
isn't it, Dean?
No, it's shocking.
- It's true, though, isn't it?
- That's not the point.
So...
who are the grommets?
Oh, they're...
friends from London.
They're cool.
Yeah, Mike?
Good piece, wasn't it?
Help with our arrangement?
Listen, Dean...
what you've given me
is tittle tattle.
Now, you wanna work for me,
I want something big.
Something life or death.
Do you know what I mean?
- Well, I'll work on it.
- Well, good.
Yeah, all right. Bye.
I'm telling you, Terry...
it's no "happy ever after"
fairy tale.
Yeah, I know.
Your marriage didn't work out.
Exactly.
Just because men and women's
genitalia happen to fit together...
we think we're supposed to spend
the rest of our lives together.
You know what marriage is?
De-sign... fault.
It's not like that.
Well, what do you and Sarah
have in common?
We watch TV.
Yeah, apart from watching TV?
- Watch videos.
- What do you talk about?
- Well...
- apart from TV... and videos.
De-sign...
fault.
Do you really think a screwdriver's
gonna make everything all right?
Well, you see, this isn't any
old screwdriver you see, Chloe...
this actually is
the king of screwdrivers.
Shall I tell you what's so tremendous
about this multi-speed beast?
It's battery operated,
which means you can use it...
anywhere in the world.
I'm not going around the world.
What?
I'm sorry about last night,
but it's ridiculous.
I'm buying this place.
You what?
This dump?
- They're selling it tomorrow.
- Twenty-four hours and counting.
- How are you gonna buy it?
- Thought I might try money.
Well, you can forget about
the airline tickets, for a start.
I mean, they're non-refundable.
It says on them, "non-refundable."
- Then, take a friend.
- Oi, oi...
surf's up!
Dean, Dean...
go away, go away!
Chloe...
just... slow down.
Yeah, let's just...
think about this.
I mean, it's...
a bit like the bathroom.
You wake up in the morning,
you have this brilliant idea...
tear everything down...
and then you lose interest.
Are you telling me
I don't know what I'm doing?
Chloe, you are wonderful.
You're beautiful.
But, yeah, you don't know
what you're doing.
Are you telling a woman with a pan
of burning fat in her hand
that she doesn't know
what she's doing?
Yeah, all right...
all right...
yeah, right.
You know what'd happen
if you did buy it, don't you?
What?
- You'd end up like Terry.
- Who's Terry?
- Terry's done a runner.
- Josh... in a minute, man.
- We need you now, JC.
- Josh, in a minute.
- Who's Terry?
- We'll talk about it later.
There is no later.
We're finished!
She just gets these crazy ideas.
I can talk her out of it.
Take some advice...
worst thing you could do
is go running after her.
What, you reckon?
Absolutely.
Just play it cool.
Wait for her to see sense.
Yeah, I mean,
she's got no money.
What's she gonna do?
Yeah.
Sarah?
Sorry...
I know, sorry.
At JC's in Cornwall.
Oi, it wasn't my idea.
Listen, did you...
what, you think I'm not worried
about my sinuses?
Listen...
did you tape
"Arthur’s knights"?
Hello? Hello?
The phones aren't too reliable
down here.
I know you all think it's stupid,
but I've got a wedding to arrange.
I've got responsibilities.
I've got people counting on me.
And I'm not gonna let them down.
Now... you say what you like...
but I'm getting the next train
out of here.
All right, Terry,
if that's the way you want it.
That...
is the way I want it.
Do you know what time
the next train is?
Let's see.
That would be...
- Tuesday.
- Two days?!
It's a small town.
We're out of season.
Bastards!
Oh, come on, Terry. What can't you
arrange on the phone?
- Josh, lend him you're mobile.
- You know how much the calls cost?
That's all right,
he can use mine.
Nice model.
Now, I don't know
about you lot...
but I could use
some blue juice.
Oh, yes!
Hello... hello?
Push the button, Terry.
Push the button, Terry!
Hello?
Where the hell are we going?
It's a short cut.
When you say
the napkins are "prune"...
are they more red,
or purple?
No, saying they're more
"snapdragon" doesn't help.
Right, we're gonna
start off over there.
- JC, the breaks are over there.
- These do keep things dry, don't they?
But you've got
to start off slowly, man.
You've got to treat the sea
with a bit of respect...
Dean, are you listening?
Dean!
I saw a turd!
- It wasn't a turd, Terry.
- What was it, a round brown fish?
All right, mate.
This wave's yours. Ready?
Remember what I said.
All the way in. Go, go, go.
Go, Terry!
All the way in!
Go on, ter!
What's happening?
Starting to pick up.
But nothing for a big wave rider
like you.
Well, there's a storm coming,
might set the boneyard off.
- You going out there?
- Well, you never know.
Some stupid townie tried it once.
He never came up.
What, he killed himself?
JC's the only one
who's done it.
That's why he's a legend.
My wave!
Out of the way, out of the way!
Comin' through!
Piece of piss,
this surfing!
You're not going in?
No.
Bury me anywhere...
but don't bury me at sea.
My head hurts.
Oh, I've got just the pill
for you, Terry.
Now, this...
will make you feel much better.
Sorry about you and Chloe, man.
It's all right, man.
It's cool. It's nothing.
If you're going around the world,
do you mind if I have a crack at her?
- We thought we'd do a collection.
- A collection for what?
- To help her buy the lease.
- She's not buying the lease.
She's coming 'round the world
with me, all right?
Radio:
Now here's a fascinating letter...
from one of our
farmer listeners, Dan.
Seems he found a way
to farm at night.
- How's he go about that, then?
- So simple, it's brilliant.
Lights...
massive industrial lights.
Simple as milking a cow, eh?
Just take a look at the productivity
levels of his root vegetable crops.
Parsnips up, 32 percent,
turnips, 37.
And carrots...
a whopping 45.
Look, I live here.
I can't afford to rip people off.
It's good gear.
All right.
Sweet.
Cheers, guys.
Listen, Josh...
I am not chasing after Chloe,
all right?
I've just got to see a man
about a board.
You can try and show Terry
a good time, can't you?
Yeah...
I suppose so.
- I know what I want to do.
- You name it, ter. Anything, man.
I want the biggest Cornish
cream tea you've ever seen.
Livin' on the edge, Terry.
If everything was in harmony...
do you think I could levitate?
Save it for the tourists, shape.
JC, there's something
I want to tell you.
Something a wise man once said.
"A man who chases fairy tales...
might miss his own happy ending."
- Was this is in India?
- King's cross station.
But enlightenment often comes
out of the mouths of fools.
Yeah, well...
I've got it all under control, man.
You know, all this staying in...
all this saving
to go around the world?
I've forgotten what it's all about.
We had our first date
on this bike.
You were just kids, then.
I'm still young at heart.
And Chloe is, too.
Just gotta remind her.
Well, find harmony...
and maybe I'll get to fly.
You just mind out for all those pigs
coming into land, shape.
JC?
Yeah?
It's coming.
Course it is, shape.
What a broken down
old wreck.
Where are you going, JC?
Oh, I'm just going down
to the machine.
Started body surfing?
No board.
No, no... I'm just gonna go
and meet the boys down there.
Oh.
We can give him a lift,
can't we, Chloe?
- Ready?
- Yeah... er, wait a sec.
All right in the back, there?
No problem...
what's with the lights, man?
She's throwing a rave.
To get some money for the lease.
One day the shaper's gonna
get these brakes fixed.
If you're gonna do it, Terry,
do it in style.
- My treat.
- Oi, oi!
Dean...!
You've given him shit,
haven't you?
No, no...
that's good "e".
"Good 'e"'?
Relax, will you? I know
what I'm doing. I'm a professional.
Dean...
lawyers are professionals.
Doctors are professionals.
Drug dealers
are not professionals.
Remember our first date
on that bike?
Yeah...
remember that?
I hated that bike.
You did?
Why do you think the carb
was always failing?
If I hadn't busted it,
you'd have never gotten rid of it...
thinking how cool you looked.
You know what a lease is,
don't you, Chloe?
It's a massive weight
around your neck.
Good!
I'm tired of drifting.
But you work so hard,
you don't have time to party.
And you know what happens
when you don't party, don't you?
You get stressed!
It's stress and work,
and work and stress.
And before you know it, Chloe,
before you know it...
you're gonna end up
like Terry.
- Who's Terry?
- Terry is boring.
He's boring with a capital "b".
He used to have a life,
then he got his pub.
And then... he changed,
just like you're gonna change.
Yeah.
Well, maybe it's just you
who thinks he's boring.
No way.
You've just got
to see him for yourself.
You'll meet him
at the rave tonight, Chloe.
Fuck it!
Come on, Terry.
Can you hear music?
Cakes...
come and get
your cakes, Terry.
- What is that tune?
- Those were the days.
I gotta find out.
Oh, thanks for your help, Josh.
Come on, Terry.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
I like it.
I really do.
Junior.
Call me "junior".
So I get the gig?
I'm sorry. Just not what the kids
are into anymore.
"Lonely for you, baby".
Sam Dees, 1968.
The label,
SSS international?
All right?
Does this look like
a "mastermind" audition?
What else you got here?
Hey..."time will pass you by".
We used to close the casino
with this.
They used to close Wigan
with "I'm on my way".
Listen, I was there
when you were still wetting nappies.
And it finished,
"time will pass you by"...
"I'm on my way",
and "long after tonight is over".
Every week,
in that order.
You went to the casino?
Number 497.
Aw, a real stomper...
Ossie Sands' "price of pain".
You know, I sampled this.
You're Josh Tambini!
Yeah, but don't go treating me
like a superstar or something.
It's no big deal.
- Mike?
- Yes, Dean?
Somebody died.
Really? Excellent.
I thought you might like that.
This is a life or death situation
and we're gonna be there.
Dean, I'm looking
at an empty chair.
You pull this off,
and you get to sit there.
Yeah. Cheers, Mike.
- I'll talk to you later. Bye.
- All right, bye-bye.
Terry... Terry...
Terry!
Sit down.
Bet you're feel a bit...
horny, don't you?
Yeah...
I do feel...
I do feel weird.
All touchy.
That's not "touchy", mate.
That's horny.
Look around.
This place is perfect.
It's full of women whose husbands
are on the golf course.
You see anything you fancy?
I'm getting married.
I'm not...
that's Mary Fenton.
What, the actress?
Nah...
- maybe... is it? She was, er...
- Guinevere in "Arthur’s knights".
Yeah, monday nights
when we were kids. Is it?
It is, it is.
She's a goddess.
She's smiling at you.
You've got to go for it.
I'm getting married.
If you don't, I will.
Guinevere's got a wet chastity belt.
Leave her alone.
Dean:
Well, come on, she's leaving.
Mary!
Come on.
Three top ten hits
is no big deal.
I can hardly
remember their names.
"Techno holiday",
"techno toyland"...
and, "techno techno techno"?
Yeah.
You've got to come
tonight, Josh.
I know so many people
who'd kill to meet you.
Yeah, well, I'll try,
but, er...
I'm kind of tied up.
Well, try hard.
Smuggler fm.
We're going right over
to join young bob...
who's out on the high seas
with the fisher boys.
Yes, so I am. And we're being pitched
and tossed from side to side.
The fishermen tell me
this is the start of a major swell.
Hey, coming up pretty rough,
is it, bob?
- Bob?
- He's throwing up.
Oh... well... I hope that bad weather
doesn't head inland...
because we've got
some event news.
- Yes... do you like to rave?
- By golly, who doesn't?
Get along to whicker point tonight.
You'll not only
have a great night out...
but you'll be helping a local girl
who's trying to buy
the world famous aqua shack.
She's only got 24 hours
to raise the money...
but smuggler fm
is right behind her.
Where's Terry?
- It's about time you got back.
- What's that mean, Dean?
We come all the way down here...
and you're more worried
about chasing after some bird.
Chloe is not a "bird".
Dean, we're surfers.
- The word is "babe".
- Oh, yeah, sorry. "babe".
What I've been doing is checking out
the best place for us to go tonight.
I've already sorted us.
It's the village hall, man.
I'm talkin' about a rave.
Rave? Oh, yes.
Oh, no.
Guess you're outvoted, Josh.
Anyway, where is Terry?
Oh, he's...
he's outside.
I never saw him.
Maybe he caught one.
Oh, no, Dean...
you haven't!
E, e, e, e, e, e...
Terry!
I love you!
Dean:
Go for it, my son!
I love you,
I love you...
come here...
come here!
Strong swell.
Gonna be big.
Real big.
Maka-hee-kee!
Yes!
Terry:
Oi, oi!
Terry?
Talk about the stocktaking.
Stocktaking?
Stocktaking.
Talk about...
stocktaking.
See if there are any maps
back there, will you?
Josh, we don't need a map.
Terry, tell her all about
the paperwork.
She wants to hear
about the paperwork.
- Headache pill, Dean?
- A corset?
This yours, JC?
No...
yes, it's mine.
I strained myself surfing.
Just acts like a big bandage.
Because, "you're as young
as you feel"...
granddad!
Will you fuck off, Dean!
Getting sick of you, man.
You fucked Terry up,
and you wanna take the piss outta me.
I'm having a laugh.
You're acting like a yob.
There's no sign.
Wait a minute.
If that's not a sign,
I don't know what is.
We better follow him.
Oi...
I know I'm not supposed
to speak, or anything...
but, can I just point out
that Terry's missing?
Terry!
Terry!
Shit.
- What?
- Shit.
What?!
I've just stepped
in cow shit.
What's wrong?
Too old to party?
I don't pretend I'm eighteen.
Wow!
Terry...!
Oh, no...
excrement!
Toe-toe-toe...
great lyrics.
It's based on futurist
repetitive poetry.
But I wouldn't expect you
to understand.
Terry, man...
Terry, get down, man.
- Go for it, ter!
- Thanks a lot, Dean.
Dean:
Terry!
That's Terry?
Chloe...
he's not normally like that.
Must be the sea air, huh?
Chloe...!
Seen the weather, man?
It's gonna go off... big time.
Massive.
- Boneyard massive?
- Chloe!
Forget Chloe, man.
This is about the boneyard.
Surf it.
You'll be a hero.
- Leave it, Dean!
- Come on, JC...
- you've got to do it.
- Don't gotta do anything.
- Fifteen quid a pill.
- I'll give you 40 for these three.
- Look, it's good gear.
- It's shit.
All right, all right.
I ripped you off...
Dean...?
What's up, man?
I fucked up.
Didn't you know?
That's what I do.
Dean,
the professional fuck-up.
- Come on, man. It's not that bad.
- Isn't it?
Shit... your face...!
Dean...?
You know, it's so easy
when you're twenty and you think...
everything'll be all right.
And then...
everything goes shit, and...
there's no one there to help you out.
All you had to do
was ask.
You were busy,
remember?
The boneyard.
How's surfing the boneyard
gonna help?
I sold the story
to a paper.
I surfed the boneyard
ten years ago.
I was in the best shape of my life,
I came that close to killing myself.
But, you could do it, JC,
I know you could do it.
You want me to risk my life
so you can earn yourself a few quid?
Fuck the money,
they're gonna give me a job.
That's all I need, a job.
To get my life sorted.
That bad?
Worse.
Dean...
you're such a fuck-up, man.
One life.
What, you'll do it?
- You'll surf the boneyard?
- Yeah.
No fear.
Looks like you've got
the best seat in the house.
This is really something, Chloe.
What did you expect?
A game of "pass the parcel",
and coco the clown?
Chloe, I...
Can you hear it?
Listen...
the blowhole.
All right, you first.
Don't lie to the blowhole
if you want to stay dry.
Okay, fire away.
You know that wave
you're always going on about?
Was it really twelve foot?
Yes, it was!
See? Really was.
Do you really wanna buy
the aqua shack?
Yes, I do.
Are we really finished?
Yes, we are.
Won't your friends
be missing you?
I wanna be with you, Chloe,
not them.
Look, this is gonna
sound silly, but...
- silly's good. I can take silly.
- But it's serious.
Serious-silly?
My favorite.
Will you listen to me?
I thought all you cared about
was impressing your friends.
I thought that's why you wanted
to go 'round the world.
I wanna go 'round the world
with you, Chloe, not them.
Then every day can be
like this one.
What made you realize?
I was there, JC.
When you told your friends
you wouldn't surf the boneyard.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah... just got a twinge.
You sure?
JC, it's not going off.
Thanks a lot.
I'm sorry.
That was a stupid thing to say.
It doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter when you're 85.
Now, it matters.
You're just worried.
Worried?
What have I got
to be worried about?
You're scared
you might hurt yourself.
Scared?
I'm not scared.
Calm down, now.
Relax...
everything will look different
in the morning.
Are you sure
this is the right way?
Absolutely.
- You're beautiful, Dean.
- Cheers, Terry.
I'm beautiful.
You're many things, Terry,
but beautiful is not one of them.
You're beautiful,
I'm beautiful.
Terry, slow down. This isn't
the right way. The caravan's...
we're gonna see Guinevere.
No, no, no.
Let go, because when they
lock you up and throw away the key,
I don't still want
to be holding your hand.
- I love her.
- It's not love, Terry...
it's a massive amount of drugs.
In a couple of hours, they'll wear off,
you'll look in the mirror...
and you'll have the biggest
anxiety attack of your life.
- I love her!
- You're making a mistake!
Guinevere!
I salute you,
my brave knight!
I love her!
Ohh, shit...!
I'm going to a youth club.
"Darling, I went to sleep last night.
And when I woke up,
I said..."
"you are the dream
that woke me up."
"You're the cream in my coffee...
a saucer for my cup."
"Whoa, I know, my baby...
that I've slept too long."
"And I'm so glad, now...
to have you home."
Ladies and gentlemen...
let me introduce you
to Josh Tambini.
Look, what's this about?
It's about soul, Josh.
It's about everything
that you've forgotten.
You know this record?
"...the price of pain..."
Ossie Sands,
"price of pain".
Yeah...?
And what did you do
with it?
"...pain, pain... hurt me..."
"you want pain?
I'll give you agony."
Look, it's not my fault
the market changed.
Blah...!
Terry?
I just give people
what they want.
- What's so funny?
- Don't you know?
It's not about money,
or clothes, or guest lists.
I know... I know.
Do you?
Oh, my god...!
Help!
Terry?
Help...!
TV:
Where are you, my brave knight?
Where are you?
I'm coming.
Take care.
Need a lift?
No, I think I'll be all right
with junior.
Let me tell you something
about junior.
She left five minutes ago.
Just how big was it
when JC surfed the boneyard?
Fuck-off big.
Well, can we get
a bit specific?
I mean, how many
"fuck-offs" to a foot?
Well, a "fuck-off" is about the size
of ten "full-ons".
I'd like to do
something like this.
Something that makes people
respect you.
So do it.
I am workin' on it.
Dean...
now is not a good time.
It is always a good time
for publicity.
Morning, morning.
What's going on?
Smuggler fm, bringing you
the big stories as they happen.
Yeah, but what are you
doing here?
Well, you...
are the big story.
No...
don't get up.
Breakfast in bed
for you.
What were you doing?
Oh...
just some tourist got his van
stuck in a ditch...
so I'm go and help him out...
and I'll be right back.
Here you are.
Don't move.
Just stay there.
Far enough away?
Just a bit further.
Now, don't feel you need
to mention me unless you want to.
Live in five.
Don't worry, boy,
just a technical term.
So, a "reef break" means,
you fall off, you land on rock.
Is that right?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Radio on:
Well, it strikes me
you're blinkin' mad, JC.
But I guess that's what it takes
to surf the boneyard, so...
good luck...
dude.
Bloody surfers.
Can't string three words together.
Radio:
That JC certainly seems
like a young man...
out to make a name
for himself.
Chloe...
you must think
I an such an idiot!
Hang on a bit, Chloe,
you don't understand.
You just have to play the hero.
Chloe, listen, if I don't do this,
I'm going to let someone down.
Don't try and make
a bigger fool of me, JC...
just go off around the world,
and let me get on with my life.
- You don't mean that.
- It's my life!
You don't mean that!
Go on, you go be Mr. Cool
in front of your friends...
even if it bloody kills you!
It's going off!
Better run, JC,
I think it's one of your friends.
Chloe...
Chloe!
Chloe!
JC!
Not now, Terry.
Terry:
I've got great news.
Not now, Terry.
I'm not getting married!
Terry, man, how am I gonna
get her back?
Forget her.
Go around the world!
What's happened to you, man?
Blue juice, JC,
that's what I needed.
I could have wasted my life.
Yeah, but, I mean,
what about Sarah?
I've got to do what makes me happy,
not what other people expect me to do.
One life, no fear.
It's not as easy
as that, Terry.
I keep having this dream.
I'm out at the boneyard,
and there's this monster wave...
and I'm falling,
and it's gonna crush me...
you wake up,
and your heart's pounding,
and you think, "oh, my god!"
Yeah, what's it mean?
You're nearly thirty.
Yeah, but...
what am I gonna do, Terry?
Whatever makes you happy.
Yeah!
Smuggler fm.
Skies may have opened,
but one of our farmer listeners
has phoned to say
his heifers are standing up...
and he thinks
it's gonna be a lovely day.
My mum used to swear by
thistle dew.
Hi!
I've been looking
all over for you.
- Let me pay.
- I thought you'd got the message.
Yeah, well...
I thought you and me, we could...
what...?
- You're Josh Tambini?
- That's what it says on the card.
Yeah, and that's what it said
on the guy's card I served yesterday.
What guy?
About so tall,
long hair.
Came here with me?
- Yeah, that's right.
- Dean.
- Listen...
- no, you listen...
you ever think
when someone's called "junior"...
there's a "senior" around?
Like, in this case,
the senior's Ossie Sands?
Sands is your father?
You used his voice,
and didn't care what you did with it.
Yes?!
No, this isn't Dean!
What are you on about,
"photographer"? Who is this?
I'm gonna kill him.
Come on, you bastard...
outside!
You're dead.
Don't be such a yob.
You stole my credit card.
I borrowed it.
Here, have it back.
- You fucked up my marriage!
- I never touched Karen!
But you told the papers
about me and those twins.
Well, I didn't make you
shag them!
No, Dean!
Not the stick!
My stick...!
You all right, Josh?
He started it!
What is wrong
with you, Dean? Hmm?
I mean, you write that crap
about Josh...
you broke my stick...
you fill Terry up with
god knows what dodgy drugs...
no, they were paracetamol,
weren't they?
- Yeah, all right, I fucked up.
- Yeah, man, once too often.
You gave me drugs?
I was tryin' to show you
a good time, Terry.
Fuck, if it wasn't for me,
we'd never all be here.
Maybe that wouldn't be
so bad, Dean!
Sorry...?
I want you out of here, man.
What about the boneyard?
That's your problem.
Oh, show Terry a good time,
and Dean's your man.
Then, things go wrong,
and I have to take all the blame?
Well, life's not
a bloody fairy tale, JC.
By tonight, Dean.
Where am I supposed to go?
I haven't got any money.
Lend us some dosh, Terry.
Hold on, JC.
I need a lift.
Josh...?
You are kidding.
I hear you've been asking
where JC lives?
Oh, I'm Terry's fiancée.
Do you know him?
Do I know Terry?
That could be me, Terry.
I could end up
a loser like Dean.
Nah...
I'm nearly thirty...
and what have I got
to show for that?
A poxy caravan,
a bad back...
and two tickets
to go around the world.
So, sell 'em to me.
All he wanted to do
was get married.
JC's just the opposite.
I said, "wedding" to him once,
just to see him squirm.
I'm not kidding.
Sweat...
real drops of sweat,
on his forehead, and this...
hunted look in his eyes.
All the time he was trying to tell me
that I hadn't frightened him.
It was Terry's idea,
not mine.
Really?
Why do they think all we want
to do is settle down?
Are you sure, Terry?
It's two thousand pounds.
No problem.
As long as my loan payments
haven't gone through.
- Terry!
- Just kidding.
Mike:
You have a slight problem,
do you, Dean?
I'm terribly sorry,
it must be an awful line...
because for one moment
I thought you said...
you didn't ever want to work
in this business again.
Now, listen to me,
Dean, darling...
I've just driven
all the way down from London
to this god-forsaken,
disease-ridden dump...
and I want to see somebody
out there surfing!
Look, everyone makes mistakes.
I mean, even your dad
made mistakes.
Have you heard his version
of "old shep"?
So, what happened
to your face?
I finally get why
you want to buy this place.
It's a bit late for that.
- Is it?
- Yep.
Way too late.
I'm not gonna do it, Chloe.
I'm not gonna surf the boneyard,
and I'm not gonna go 'round the world.
Aren't you scared of what
your friends may say?
The only thing I'm scared of
is losing you.
It's easy to say, huh?
I've heard it all before, JC.
I've got an auction
to get to.
Listen, the rave money
will never be enough.
- Well, it's all I've got.
- No, it's not.
I'm selling the tickets to Terry.
As soon as he gives me the money...
I'm gonna go straight
to the auction.
I can't believe you anymore.
Do you know where Terry is?
He'll be back soon.
Have a seat.
It's really blowing.
Oh, yeah... gonna be
some big waves, massive.
So, which one are you?
Oh, did Terry tell you about us?
What did he say?
He said JC was a brilliant surfer,
but I know you're not him.
Josh was this really big
record producer...
go on.
And Dean...
I can take it.
He said you had lots
of unfulfilled potential.
Did he?
That's a very
nice way of saying,
I'm a never done anything
fuck-up yob.
- He didn't say that.
- Well, he should have done.
You gonna be all right
on your own?
Only I've gotta go
and fulfill that potential.
Dean?
Terry's not...
with another woman, is he?
Nah...
all he does
is talk about you.
Hello?
Sorry?
He said, "if you look
out of the window...
you'll see king Arthur
has returned, Mrs. Fenton."
- Guinevere!
- Oh, my god.
Guinevere, I...
just hold it
with the "Guinevere" shit.
You think I'm Mary Fenton,
don't you?
Well, it's not the first time.
I might look like her, but I'm not
her.
So you might as well
just clear off...
- Lancelot.
- I'm supposed to be Arthur.
Whoever.
Sorry.
So, what were we gonna do
if I had been her?
Ride off 'round the world?
Fly, actually.
Go on.
Giddy-up.
- I'm looking for JC.
- Sorry, I'm waiting for Terry.
You don't know if he said anything
about surfing the boneyard?
That's where Dean's
gone to surf.
- You mean, JC?
- No, Dean.
Come on, we gotta go
and find JC.
It's getting worse.
Where's JC?
Sarah!
Where's JC?
Bank.
There he is!
You're enjoying this.
You don't enjoy
things like this.
Hang on!
Terry...
as soon as you've
dropped us off...
get to the bank,
get the money...
and get to the auction.
Understand, Terry?
- Yeah.
- I'm counting on you, mate.
The brakes aren't working.
- Stamp on them!
- I am!
Need a lift?
Come on, we've got
to get to the bank.
- There's a bike in the back.
- Oh, no!
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen...
can I ask you all
to please take your seats?
I'd like to welcome you here
on behalf of Foster and Davis...
for this afternoon's auction.
I'm going to explain
to you to begin with...
stop the car.
What?
Stop the car!
There's no time
to go to the beach!
Oh, no...
that's too much!
How else am I gonna catch him?
What's he talking about?
Cliff hop.
Where are you, JC?
Full fucking on!
No!
What's he gonna do?
Ride it to him, flip 360 off the lip
so he doesn't come down on the slab.
Now, listen, you...
you get me a couple of chicks
to pose with those two...
and this... is yours.
There goes twenty years
of non-violence.
Terry...
are you sure this is
the way to the bank?
Where's the sand?
Don't ask!
Excuse me...
excuse me, what lot are we on?
Ask him.
- Have you sold the aqua shack yet?
- Yes, we have.
- Who to?
- Miss... no, Mr. Toshack.
Shape, this isn't the way
to the station.
Scenic route.
Trust me.
I wanted the old one.
The way I see it, Chloe...
the aqua shack
is wherever we are.
Yeah.
This isn't just gonna be a place
for your friends to hang out?
What, this lot?
They're not my friends,
they're customers.
Beg.
What... now?
Beg.
I'd do anything.
Pathetic.
I'd run down the street, naked.
Yeah?
At four o'clock
in the morning?
No. High noon.
I love you, Chloe.
Radio:
It's another beaut day,
in the high eighties at manly beach.
And a listener's phoned to say
the sticky buds on his eucalyptus
means rain's coming our way.
My mum used to swear by
koala droppings.
Terry:
What a beautiful girl.
Isn't she beautiful?
- Maybe one day...
- us?
You all right, Terry?
You look kinda pale.
No... fine, fine.
Come on... surf's up.
Oh, light shines on...
how was that?
Ossie, that was beautiful.
Straight into the techno mix.
Do we have to?
Gotta pay the bills.
It's going off!
Come here.
What?
You're gonna miss it.
No, I'm not.
Do you want a board?
You come and see me
when the old man's gone.
- You and I can do some business.
- Did you really surf the boneyard?
You know what
"triple overhead" means?
Get on with it!
Harmony.
