THE PARTY BUSINESS.
AS IN TUPPERWARE ?
PLEASE !
WOULD YOU BE SERIOUS ?
COME ON.
YOU TAKE OVER A PLACE--
BUILDING, LOFT, ANYTHING--

A THEME.
PUT IN A LIGHT SHOW,
GET A REALLY HOT DEEJAY,
LINE UP A COUPLE ACTS,

2,000 PEOPLE
AT 20 BUCKS A HEAD,
PLUS WHAT YOU MAKE
AT THE BAR.
YOU GUYS ARE
REALLY ON A ROLL.
WOULD YOU BOYS PLEASE
CALM DOWN AND SIT DOWN ?
SAM, WE'VE GOT TO HAVE
OUR OWN PAY PARTY.
IT'S THE PERFECT WAY
TO INTRODUCE THE GUYS.
YOU CAN GET ALL THE PRESS
AND THE OPINION-MAKERS
THERE.
IT'LL BE INSTANT STARDOM !
DO YOU WINOS HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT WILL COST ?
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THE PROFITS COULD BE ?
"2,000 PEOPLE,
 20 BUCKS A HEAD,
 PLUS WHAT YOU MAKE AT THE BAR."
THIS IS GOING
TO TURN STEVE WAITS
INTO A BASKET CASE.
HOWEVER, I'M NOT SPENDING
ANY OF MY SAVINGS.
OH, NO, NO.
I THINK IT'S TIME I MAKE
MY FAREWELL APPEARANCE.
HELLO, SYDNE ?

SHH !

- MA, IT'S ONLY A COMMERCIAL.
- AW, NOW, HONEY,
DID GERSHWIN EVER WRITE
A HIT COMMERCIAL, HUH ?
WELL,
HOW'D YOU LIKE IT ?
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE GOING
TO SHOW SO MUCH OF YOURSELF
ON TELEVISION.
OH, SAM, THAT IS THE MOST
GLAMOROUS AND SEXY
COMMERCIAL I HAVE EVER SEEN.
AW, LULU.
LULU, WILL YOU
TAKE THIS AWAY ?
I DO NOT DO MANUAL LABOR.
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING ?
YOU ARE SO UPTIGHT...
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
A GREAT CAREER MOVE
WHEN YOU SEE ONE.
IF THAT DOESN'T SELL MILK,
NOTHING WILL.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, SAMANTHA,
I'M HAVING A BIT OF A PROBLEM
WITH THE ADVERTISING AGENCY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
DESPITE THE FACT
THAT I THINK
IT'S FABULOUS,
THE CLIENT
NEEDS MORE TIME
TO THINK IT OVER.
THINK WHAT OVER ?
THE HIGHER ECHELON
OF MADISON AVENUE...
FEELS THAT IT MAY BE
TOO CONTROVERSIAL...
FOR THE AMERICAN
FAMILY IMAGE.
CORPORATE THINKING SUCKS.
MOTHER !
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CHIC
AND TASTEFUL.
TWO QUALITIES OFTEN
IGNORED BY TELEVISION.
WELL, THIS MEANS
NO RESIDUALS FOR A WHILE.
RESIDUALS ?  DOES THAT
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH MONEY ?
HMM.
UH, YEAH,
WE NEED IT NOW.
WELL, YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY
BE OVERDRAWN AT THE BANK.
[ Laughing ]
COULD YOU, DEAR ?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
WE WERE GOING TO USE
THE RESIDUAL PAYMENTS
FROM THE COMMERCIAL...
TO PUT ON A PAY PARTY
TO INTRODUCE
THE VILLAGE PEOPLE.
[ Sydne ]
PAY TO GO TO A PARTY ?
HOW GAUCHE !
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY.
MY BRIDGE CLUB
WILL THROW THE PARTY.
WE'LL USE THE ELKS LODGE.
WHY, IT'LL BE BIGGER
THAN BINGO NIGHT.
MOM, THAT'S WONDERFUL,
BUT, SEE, WE WERE THINKING
OF SOMETHING SPECTACULAR.
UH-OH.  YOU NEED
THE BIG BUCKS, HUH ?
YEAH.
WELL, MY GOODNESS,
A PARTY IS A PARTY.
IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.
NORMA, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
SOMETHING FOR AROUND
2,000 PEOPLE...
WITH LIGHTS
AND COSTUMES.
I MEAN,
A REAL SHOW.
WELL, I DID ONE FOR 3,000
LAST MONTH IN--
WHERE WAS IT ?
HOUSTON.
YOU GAVE A PARTY
FOR 3,000 PEOPLE ?
MM-HMM.
A CHARITY FUND-RAISER.
IT'S ONE OF MY HOBBIES.
BUT, OF COURSE, WE DO
RAISE A LOT OF MONEY
FOR THE NEEDY.
MRS. WHITE, WOULD YOU
CONSIDER US NEEDY ?
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I AM IN CHARGE OF
A REALLY GRAND AFFAIR...
NEXT MONTH IN SAN FRANCISCO
AT THE GALLERIA.
NOW, WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE
FOR THE BOYS TO SING
A FEW SONGS ?
A-- A FEW SONGS ?  HEY !
WE WILL KNOCK 'EM OUT !
I THINK I SHOULD GET
STEVE WAITS IN ON THIS.
LET'S HAVE
SOME CHAMPAGNE !
LULU,
PACK MY FALL WARDROBE.
I ADORE SAN FRANCISCO.
MY FAVORITE
EX-HUSBAND LIVES THERE.
AND I AM DOWN
TO MY LAST PUCCI.
HAVE I GOT
A WHOLESALER FOR YOU !
STEVE ?  HELLO, DARLING.
IT'S SAMANTHA.
I, UH, THINK I HAVE
AN OFFER YOU CAN'T REFUSE.
HOW ABOUT A LONG WEEKEND
IN SAN FRANCISCO ?
UH-HUH.  WELL,
I'LL SEE YOU AT YOUR PLACE
IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES.
I'LL GIVE YOU
ALL THE DETAILS.
[ Laughs ]
BYE.
I JUST SEALED OUR FUTURE.
AND ENDED OURS.
GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE GUTTER.
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
STEP INTO MY OFFICE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU CALLED STEVE WAITS...
AND MADE AN ASSIGNATION
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME !
WHAT'S THAT ?
A DATE !
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO ?
I WOULDN'T DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT BEHIND YOUR BACK.
WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO,
SEDUCE HIM INTO A DEAL ?
IS THAT ACTUALLY
WHAT YOU THINK OF ME ?
I DON'T KNOW.  I--
OH, REALLY ?
WELL, UM, IF THAT'S THE CASE,
I SUGGEST WE SEE EACH OTHER
ONLY ON A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP
FROM NOW ON.
AND I'LL SEE YOU
IN SAN FRANCISCO, MR. WHITE.
ALL RIGHT, SO MAKE IT QUICK
BECAUSE SAMANTHA'S
GONNA BE HERE ANY MINUTE.
HOW DID WE DO
IN CHICAGO ?
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.
UH-HUH.  UH-HUH.
MM-HMM.  UH-HUH.
OKAY, GOOD-BYE.
CHARLIE, THE MINUTE
SHE GETS ON BOARD,
SLAM THE DOOR AND
TAKE OFF, ALL RIGHT ?
[ Tires Screeching ]
NEVER MIND.
[ Car Door Closes ]
IS THAT YOU, SAM ?
HI, MR. WAITS.  I'M SORRY.
SAM COULDN'T MAKE IT.
IT'S A LONG STORY.
OH, MY GOD.
A REAL PRIVATE JET !
SOMEDAY YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE ONE OF THESE, BABY.
A LITTLE BIGGER, I HOPE.
AND I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE DECOR MYSELF.
NOT SO BUSY.
AND WHO'S THIS ?
OH, UH, MR. WAITS,
THIS IS MY MOTHER.
HELEN MORELL.  AND YOU CAN
JUST THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS
THAT YOU KNOW MY SON.

WILD BLUE YONDER !
HERE WE GO !
GEE, THESE LOOK GOOD.
DON'T TOUCH THAT, JACKIE.
IT'LL GIVE YOU THE TROTS.
WHEW !  CAN'T WE GET RID
OF THAT SMELLY THING ?
I GOT ALL
YOUR FAVORITES HERE, BABY.
I GOT CHICKEN SOUP
WITH MATZO BALLS.
I GOT KREPLACH.
 I GOT STUFFED CABBAGE.
SHE'S NOT EVEN JEWISH.
WELL, WHEN IT COMES TO EATING,
ALL MOTHERS ARE JEWISH.
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE !
I AM BEING HIJACKED
IN MY OWN AIRPLANE !
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ?
I AM THE PRESIDENT OF
A MAJOR RECORD COMPANY.
IS IT REALLY KREPLACH
IN THERE ?
I GOT EVERYTHING.
YOU SEE, SIR,
MY FATHER IS JEWISH,
BUT MY MOM,
SHE'S ITALIAN-CATHOLIC.
SO, WE GOT
ALL THE BASES COVERED.
SPEAKING OF BASEBALL,
WHILE THE OTHER KIDS WERE
FOLLOWING THE BASEBALL SCORES,
I WAS FOLLOWING THE POP CHARTS.
YOU CAN ASK ME ANY--
I THINK I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.
WHY DON'T YOU SAVE THAT FOR
THE LINER NOTES ON THE ALBUM ?
ALBUM ?  WE'RE GETTING
AN ALBUM DEAL ?
NO !  I DID NOT SAY THAT.
I WORKED FOR DAVID MERRICK
ON BROADWAY.
I KNOW ABOUT CONTRACTS.
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO INSIST ON 10%
OF THE FIRST 100% NET PROFITS.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE NOT
SEEN THIS GROUP EVEN PERFORM.
OH, LET ME TELL YOU !
AFTER THIS CONCERT,
PEOPLE WILL BE STANDING
ON THEIR HEADS TO BID.
NOBODY IN THIS WORLD IS GONNA
GIVE YOU ANY MORE THAN 2%
OF 6% OF 100% OF THE PROFITS.
HOW ABOUT NINE PERCENT ?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
NO MORE THAN SEVEN.
EIGHT PERCENT ?
YOU'RE ROBBING ME.
OH, USE YOUR NAPKIN !
I'M SORRY.
[ Whispering ]
WHAT ABOUT THE MERCHANDISING ?
NOT SO FAST !
AH, YES, THE MERCHANDISING.
NOW, I THINK THAT WE WILL
HAVE TO ASK FOR THE T-SHIRTS.
I FEEL LIKE I'M SITTING
ON MY OWN PLANE WITH
MA BARKER AND HER KID !
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANNA FIGHT ?
YOU GET THE T-SHIRTS,
I GET THE LUNCH PAILS
AND THE LOOK-ALIKE DOLLS.
YOU CAN HAVE
THE T-SHIRTS IN JAPAN.
WE WILL TAKE THE LUNCH PAILS

BACK UP A MINUTE
AND GO ALL THE WAY
BACK TO THE BEGINNING.
NOW, WHICH ONE
IS THE KREPLACH ?
I SEE YOU.
