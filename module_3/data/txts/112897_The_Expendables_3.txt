Lucky ring on.
I feel so much safer.
Grip it. We're coming in hot!
Hold on!
Whoa!
Clear!
Let's go.
What's the holdup?
Nothing, we're on our way.
Let's go!
Your dude's trippin'!
Ahhh!
Doc!
Hey, forget this maniac!
I'm not leavin' him!
Doc!
Doc!
Move!
Whoa. You just gonna roll up on me, huh?
After eight damn years.
What's up with that?
You were in a black-ops prison
that doesn't officially exist.
I just got the location
from a guy named Church,
an agency spook.
Excuse me?
Agency official. Relax.
I think you're in
a time warp, man.
What a waste of life. You
make one damn mistake!
Wasn't a mistake.
It was stupid.
If you'd have done that to me, I
would've chopped you into pieces.
You would've tried.
Hey, you wanna thank the guys?
The guys? Where are our guys?
Hammer? Woodsman?
Gone.
Dead gone?
Yeah.
Damn.
Heard you killed more
people than the plague.
How 'bout that?
Why do they call
you Doctor Death?
Used to be a medic.
But that was a long time ago.
So why'd you get locked away?
Tax evasion.
So you all that's left
of the Expendables?
We're it.
We started out with five.
Built up to 22.
I see Barney's still
hanging the tags up there.
Said that jinglin'
sound the tags make,
that's a reminder that
our brothers are still here.
Somewhere.
So come on, Viking.
Give an old-schooler your blade.
Or else you might find your
tags up there jinglin', too.
Jing-a-Ling. Jing-a-Ling,
jing-a-Ling.
Sharpen it when you're done.
I think your friend's
a little off.
Come on, Christmas. He's been
in a hole for eight years.
How'd he get so lucky?
He tried pulling off this half-assed
political assassination for a few bucks
in this place called Swaziland.
And he blew it.
Self-destructive.
Yeah, something like that.
But you know what he is?
He's a good medic.
Well, I don't need a checkup.
Why are you so sarcastic?
You're vague.
- Vague?
- Secrets, idiot.
I mean, why do you take me halfway
around the planet to save this
medical genius, as
you describe him?
For what?
He's an Expendable.
Oh, my God. Come on.
He's an Expendable.
So, he's one of the flock?
Let me tell you something.
If you were
incarcerated for years,
I'd come and save you.
Thanks, hero.
But I doubt it.
And I know you'd do
the same for me.
- Truthfully?
- You'd let me rot?
Exactly.
Hey, Doc.
What's your name?
Christmas.
Is that real?
Authentic.
Is that real, too?
Oh, no, I spend three
hours every morning
putting this on
with a black Biro.
This is real. Authentic.
Original. Look at that.
Ha.
Huh.
Balance is a little off.
You a knife man?
Best. Ever.
I'm the Knife Before Christmas.
Ain't that right, Barney?
If you say so.
Probably free-stylin' with a blade while you
were still suckin' on your daddy's titty,
tryin' to learn how
to eat with a spoon.
Yeah. Is that another little secret
you was keeping there, Mr. Vague-o?
Just stay out of my
brain, would you?
I tell ya. I can't
wait to get home.
Eat some good food, put
on some fine threads,
break out my '49 Pontiac,
kick that baby until the
engine blows up!
You didn't tell him, did you?
Tell me what?
We're not going home.
We're stoppin' a dealer named Victor Minns
delivering a shipment of thermobaric bombs.
Oh, come on, man!
That shit is hellfire.
Hey, routine stuff.
You know, why didn't you just
pick me up on your way back?
We're a man short.
Well, you know I'd love
to party with you boys,
but, uh, I don't have my shit.
Oh.
- That's my shit.
- It is your shit.
Doc, did you thank the
guys for helping you out?
Say somethin'.
Uh, listen up.
Uh...
It's been a long time since I
had a reason to say thank you.
So I just wanna...
I, you know...
He's getting his rhythm.
I wanna say, uh...
Thank you.
His sincerity's overwhelming.
Think I'm gonna weep.
You know what? Enough.
Can you not be sarcastic?
That was great, Doc. Seriously.
- That was good.
- Pretty good.
- You haven't talked for a long time.
- Yeah.
- You got the gift.
- So you heard?
It's like riding a bike.
To me it was like
Churchill's best moment.
- Gettysburg Address.
- I think I made my point...
- Yeah, it moved me. It moved him.
- Okay.
- I moved you, too?
- Stunning delivery.
- Yeah.
- Stunning.
Okay.
- Doc.
- Yeah?
Great to have you back.
No better place to be. Yeah.
'Bout time you boys showed up.
- Nice boat.
- Thanks, ladies. Stole it myself.
Got three more just like
it patrolling the harbor.
Two-man ground teams
every 400 meters.
Good work.
Just 'cause you can fly a plane
don't make you smarter than me.
Sure it does.
So you the reason I've been stuck
down here in this shithole?
Shithole? Brother,
you have no idea.
Oh, yeah.
What the hell is that?
This bitch'll solve
all your problems.
Yeah, maybe for 10 seconds
before it blows its wad.
So now you got
that problem, too?
You walked into that one.
Come on,
look alive, look alive.
Good luck.
It was all under control.
Yeah, that's what
it looked like.
He saw you,
he didn't see me.
Where ya been?
Had a doctor's appointment.
Catch up with
you boys later.
Where's he goin'?
Happy New Year, motherfuckers!
Makin' a Housecall.
Doc, go.
Oh, Sally, the man
attacked me with a knife.
- Damn. He's good.
- Maybe to you.
- You're gonna wanna see this.
- See what?
<i>I'll show you.</i>
Damn. He's really good.
- Say it again, I'll shoot you.
- Chill.
Get in.
Where's the bomb?
It'll be here.
Barney, it looks like
the target is right on time.
There's Minns.
Let's take him out fast.
Barney, I gotta put you down.
- It can't be.
- What can't be?
We gonna shoot these
guys or what?
What's the holdup?
He's dead.
Who's dead?
Stonebanks.
Stonebanks!
Come on, get in, get in,
get in, get in, get in!
Barney, move! Go, go, go!
Ah! Come on!
It's time to mow the lawn!
Huh?
Told you. Ten seconds.
Hang on!
I found you a ride!
Time to go!
Come on!
Go, go, go!
- How much we gettin' paid for this?
- Not enough.
Go right!
- You're not gonna fit!
- Always negative.
I'm getting carsick.
Hang on, Doc!
- Right side!
- Got it!
Get out!
Come on!
Caesar, we're coming your way!
Where are you?
<i>In this filthy river.
Behind you!</i>
Try to stay as close as you can!
Make room for Caesar!
Move your asses!
What was that?
A huge black guy in a boat.
Hold it, hold it!
You got it goin'!
- You all right?
- Yep.
Pull over.
Ahhh!
Incoming!
Move! Move!
Maybe this will bring you luck.
Is he gonna make it?
I don't know.
Who did this?
Stonebanks.
I thought you killed him.
So did I.
He shot Caesar to
get back at me.
You know, I'm getting
out of this business.
And so should you.
Not yet.
Hey.
If you need any help
with Stonebanks...
I'm supposed to meet
a guy named Church.
I know you were.
So who are you?
Operations Officer Drummer.
You don't have to worry
about Church anymore.
He's, um... He's out
of the picture.
Jesus, Ross.
What a mess.
We gave you everything.
Target, opportunity.
All the intel you could ask for,
and you got decimated
and my target walked away.
Am I wrong here?
Am I missing something?
Yeah. Church said the target's
name was Victor Minns.
- And?
- He was wrong.
His real name is
Conrad Stonebanks.
We knew him only
as Victor Minns.
Arms dealer, made billions
selling to every psycho warlord
in Africa and the Middle East.
Has his own mercenary army.
He's personally responsible
for torturing and killing
two of the best men
I ever knew. Friends.
I don't give a shit
what his name is.
I don't like him.
I want him as bad as you do.
This happened on my watch.
You fucked up,
and I'm wearing it.
I'll find him. Again.
You got one more shot.
Nice to finally
meet you, Barney.
Your men are shot to shit.
What are you gonna
do for a team?
Don't worry about it.
I'll handle it, Drummer.
Relax.
You're gonna give
yourself a stroke.
What's with these guys?
You mind?
Do you think when the
artist painted this
he ever thought it would go
for such a ridiculous price?
I mean, what is it?
It's just some paint,
brushes, some cheap canvas.
What's the big deal?
It's shit. What do
you want for it?
- Three million.
- Done.
Done.
You know, it's very
hard for me to say this,
but at one time, you
guys were the best.
Maybe still are.
But nothing lasts forever.
Hard as it is to hear,
we aren't the future anymore.
Unfortunately for us,
we're part of the past.
You, uh... You going
somewhere with this?
As I see it, if we
keep this life up,
the only way this thing
ends, for all of us,
is in a hole in the ground
and no one giving a shit.
Now, if that's the way I'm supposed
to go out, I can live with that.
For me.
But what I can't live with,
and won't live with,
is taking you with me.
What're you saying?
That's our call.
I'm changing things now.
You. Me.
All of us.
It's over.
- We're done.
- Done?
You break me out
to cut me loose?
You'll survive.
You all will.
Live your lives while you can.
Where're you goin', Barney?
You think you just pull
the plug and that's it?
Just did.
Yeah? Well, it doesn't
work that way!
- What?
- We've been through the mud,
the shit, and the blood.
And I've saved your ass more
times than I can count.
You owe me a shot at this son of
a bitch that took Caesar down.
We're not doing that.
When I joined, I joined
for the whole ride.
I know you did.
Ride's over.
Bonaparte.
Sorry to hear about Caesar.
Hope he pulls through.
He's a good one.
The good ones are rare.
Yeah.
Well, here we are again.
What do you need?
A new team. Retired
the old ones.
Welcome to the 21st century.
What kind of guys
you looking for?
Young, hungry, willing
to take a bullet.
I'm going after Stonebanks.
Stonebanks.
Glad to see I'm not the
only one slipping a notch.
Stonebanks is dead, my friend.
<i>Mortuus Diu...</i>
No, he's not.
That's not good.
If he's half of
what he used to be,
four or five ain't gonna cut it.
You're gonna need 50.
Gotta move fast. No time.
If I gotta do it fast,
I can't guarantee the best.
Just give me some that
don't give a damn.
What, it's a one-way ticket?
Could be.
Fine. I've got a line
on a few head cases.
A couple of these guys you'll
probably end up shooting yourself.
Wait. What about these guys?
They anything?
These guys are pussies.
Hmm.
Goes by Thom. Expert hacker.
Drone pilot.
Did 18 months for hacking into
Seattle's Central Operating System.
Shut down the whole
city for three days.
Why the hell would he do that?
'Cause he can.
What?
I'm not looking for
an office worker.
Oh, that's not him.
That's him.
Another one with a death wish.
You two got a lot in common.
I could do that.
You know what? I'm gonna
come right out and say it.
I belong on you.
One, two...
- You can't do that.
- No.
I want a special
rate on that one.
Yeah, yeah, hazard pay.
Always on the damn road going someplace
you don't give a damn about.
Beats standing still.
Yeah, I've got two ex-wives and three kids
who've lost my number would disagree.
Hey, did you turn
off the auto-pilot?
I didn't touch the auto-pilot.
Give me the booze.
Are we off course?
Where the hell are we?
Here, hang on a second.
Is that...
Is that the Big Dipper?
Yeah, we gotta turn around.
Wow.
<i>Next candidate is an expert at
field craft and close-quarters combat.</i>
- Luna.
- Hi.
Ambitious young lady.
Meet a friend of mine,
Barney Ross. Barney Ross, Luna.
Luna, Barney Ross.
- Hey, how're you doin'?
- Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Ross.
Gentlemen, follow me.
I have your table waiting.
Come on. Live a little.
So, Luna, how are things?
You know. Gets old.
What you wanna do?
You wanna go, Bro?
If you guys will excuse me.
All right, so what
are we doing here?
Have a drink.
Where's the candidate?
Right there in the red dress,
about to chop those guys in half.
The hostess?
Not the hostess.
She's the bouncer.
I could do that.
You wanna slip on a dress
and give it a shot?
Men.
She's good.
You ought to see
her without heels.
When was your last checkup?
I don't know. A while back.
High cholesterol,
plaque, all that stuff?
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Yeah.
Except with me they found
a lump on my lung.
Very dark, they said.
Oh, no.
I sure didn't see that comin'.
Well, what are you going to do?
Try to make as much
money as I can,
- fast as I can.
- Yeah.
For those kids, you know.
The ones I don't talk to.
Make some kind of good
impression on 'em
when I'm gone.
Sad, isn't it?
Yeah, it is sad. I'm sorry.
- Ah, it's all bullshit. I'm fine.
- What?
Just checking
you're still human.
Had you going there,
though, didn't I?
- Yeah, you did, God damn it.
- All right. Good.
That can never happen again.
- I'll never trust you again.
- All right.
Next kid's a bit
of a dark horse.
Just came across my desk.
I don't like throwing
in wild cards,
but this guy's creds were
too good to pass up.
Mmm-hmm.
Anybody seen Felipe?
Yo, Felipe!
Looks good, Bonaparte.
Yeah, not bad.
You finally got it right.
Damn.
Felipe Silva,
meet Barney Ross.
Galgo. You sent me
another fake resume?
Eh, Mr. Ross, I can
do what you need,
whatever you need.
I am healthier than I look,
stronger than I look,
faster than I look.
Actually, faster
than anybody I know.
Shit.
You were born in 1984?
Of course not!
But I feel like I
was born in '84.
Do not waste your time.
Barney, we're leaving.
Mr. Ross.
Mr. Ross, Mr. Ross! Please.
You see,
it's like I have discovered
the Fountain of Youth.
I mean, not the
Fountain of Youth.
Ponce de Leon
discovered that one.
By the way, another great
Spaniard, like myself.
No. No. Mr. Ross,
age is just a state of mind.
You know, you're only
old when you surrender,
when you give up.
And I haven't. Not yet.
- Galgo, this shit has got to stop.
- I got to go.
This is the third
time this month.
Seriously, move on!
What's this guy's story?
Actually, I feel a little sorry for him.
His last team dropped him.
Back in the day, you couldn't catch him.
Very fast.
- Maybe even faster than you.
- No way.
Oh, maybe. But what am I gonna say?
It's a young man's game.
I need a job!
All I know what to do
is killing people!
And I do that very well!
God damn it!
What's the story on this guy?
- Found him at DARPA.
- DARPA?
Yeah, it sounds like a
town in North Africa.
Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency,
where they send the brightest military
minds to develop next-Gen weapons.
Google it.
I'm not looking for
a weapons nerd.
Ah.
Then you've come to
the right place.
Yo, Marlito!
Mars, I'd like you
to meet Barney Ross.
As shooters go, Mars is
as gifted as they get.
Whatever you say.
What do you say?
What I've got here is an
XM25 assault rifle. Laser ranged.
25mm high explosive
airburst rounds.
Can be programmed to detonate
over or behind a target.
He'll do.
Final candidate, John Smilee.
Guy's got the most
heat in the industry.
A lot of skills, Marines, Special Operator.
But there is an issue.
What issue?
A classic authority problem.
There's a couple more swimming
around in there, too.
Sorry, Barney, for wasting
your time like this.
He's not the guy I
thought he was.
No.
I wanna meet him.
Oh.
John. Meet Barney Ross.
Didn't do much to impress
out there today, did you?
You called me,
I didn't call you.
Took a dive for the money?
Maybe you like getting your ass
kicked in front of strangers?
What do you guys want from me?
You runnin' from somethin'?
I don't know you.
But I know you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
How's that?
Maybe he thinks
you've got potential.
We're short on time.
That about right?
That's about it.
Well, that's your problem.
And your problem is you're
rolling around in the dirt
- for chump change.
- Hmm.
I hear you lost a few
friends in the desert.
They bought it. You didn't.
You wear the guilt.
I've been there.
He's been there.
We all lived it.
But you don't know me.
I know the type.
Bonaparte, you were right.
You did waste my time.
Hey.
You didn't waste your time.
If you're going after Stonebanks, we
might wanna talk about financials now.
Normally, it's just 10%,
but I figure with
Stonebanks in the equation,
I might wanna get my
fee, well, possibly now.
Right.
I mean, not that you're
not good for it.
Just, if you don't mind.
I don't mind.
Sounds like you don't have
too much faith in me.
I don't.
How was your vacation?
Ready to go to work?
Did you find him yet?
He's in Bucharest putting together
a deal with some Albanian mobster.
You've got 36 hours.
That's your window.
After that, he's
back off the grid.
Satellite map. Coordinates
for where he'll be.
Interesting guy, your
friend Stonebanks.
You're not gonna like this,
but they want him alive.
Are you kidding me?
They wanna try him at The Hague
for war crimes.
You're gonna give this
guy a chance in court?
It's not my decision.
No. Never is.
- That's the way it's gotta be.
- Right.
The Agency's got a local safe house.
You're gonna need it.
Don't trash the place.
- Heard you got a job.
- That's right.
Who the hell are they?
They're with me.
But we're not?
Gunner, I told you everything I
had to tell you back at the bar.
Stop drinking so much.
You wanna get yourself killed.
With those youngsters?
Do us all a favor and get
the hell outta here.
Wheels up in 10.
Come on.
If your guys wanted to fight, why
didn't they just get married?
You're seriously smoking
next to aviation fuel?
Amateur.
Amateur assholes.
Who are you calling
asshole, Grandpa?
Grandpa's about to
crush your windpipe.
What's this? Your toy?
Boy?
- You wanna dance, big guy?
- Hey!
It's just a job.
Come on, let's go.
Bunch of has-beens still
trying to be hard.
You're young and you're dumb.
Jing-a-Ling, jing-a-Ling.
Keep it. You're gonna need it.
Never thought you would
call in that favor.
Don't look so happy about it.
Do you mind?
This is the least
of your worries.
Look, here's an idea, how about
we focus on the assignment?
Now, does anyone know anything
about this Stonebanks?
Stonebanks was SASR.
- Australian Special Forces.
- And that's all you know?
- Well, it's more than you two know.
- Really?
So, you're both useless.
Here's another idea...
Why don't you assholes
take it outside?
You got a minute?
What do you need?
Tell me more about this
guy we're going after.
Doesn't matter. You
were hired to do a job.
How 'bout answering why
we're doing this job?
I owe you a salary.
That's it.
Why are we going
after Stonebanks?
You have a hard time
taking orders, don't you?
If I don't know what
they are, yeah.
I know you don't give a damn about us.
I get that.
But just tell me why you wanna
take out this guy so bad.
Thirty seconds to drop!
<i>Copy that.</i>
Let's go.
I can take care of myself.
<i>Twenty seconds to drop.</i>
Ten seconds!
Whoo! This is tight!
We're on.
This guy's got more muscle
than a cartel king.
Maybe he's overcompensating
for something.
What are you drinking
down there, Barney?
Is that a vanilla
latte or something?
Stay sharp.
Luna? Move.
Think again, mister,
because I won't.
I promise this won't
happen again.
- Move the car.
- I'm talking to you!
Nice driving, Mars.
Good performance.
Yeah, too good. Any closer
and I'd beat his ass.
I believe her.
We got him.
Man, this guy's protected
better than the President.
Yeah, and his crib's
like a five-star fortress.
That's why we're not
taking him there.
And the hotel is full of guests.
- So where do we hit him?
- At the meet.
We hit him from all four sides.
Hit him hard.
Okay.
Um, so, our plan is to, what?
Kick down the door and
start spraying bullets?
It's a great plan
if it was 1985.
And what is that
supposed to mean?
You heard me.
- You got a better plan?
- Much better.
Let's hear it.
Thorn, you're up.
Oh, uh...
Okay. I'm the plan. Um...
This ought to be good.
First, I hack the security
grid main server.
Boom. Bypass the motion-detector
lasers and biometric sensors.
Pow. Override the surveillance
video and CCTV systems.
Ba-bam. And we are in.
It's child's play.
- Just like that?
- Just like that.
Just like that.
Exactly like that.
You better be right.
- Ba-bam.
- Ba-bam.
Let's go!
So, why'd you let your team go?
If you stick around long enough,
you're gonna buy it. It was time.
They didn't seem too
happy about it.
If you're looking to
go the family route,
it's the wrong job for you.
There are different
kinds of family.
And when my life is on the line,
it's my family fighting with me.
You know what I mean.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Right on time.
Ladies first.
Go ahead then, Thorn.
Will you shut up
and get in the sewer?
Okay.
And, ladies and gentlemen, we
officially have eyes in the sky.
Copy that. Let's do this.
Thought you'd never ask.
<i>Good to go.</i>
Good luck, boys.
Whoa. Shit.
What's the problem?
The buyer. They're early.
Threat just doubled.
You're early.
What do you think?
Eh, it's okay.
When Cain slew his brother,
God banished him
from civilization.
<i>But before that, he
placed a mark on him.</i>
<i>Not as a felon's brand,</i>
but to protect him
from roving hunters.
Customs does not X-ray artwork.
It ruins the oils.
Very good.
There you have it.
- Pleasure.
- As always.
Can you access nuclear weapons?
I might.
But, generally, I find people are a
little too emotional for ownership.
And I'd hate you killing all my
other customers by accident.
Or on purpose.
In position.
In position.
Set.
I pay you what you want.
Let me think about it.
We're on.
Stonebanks is moving, watch it.
I like little mice.
Try again.
Open sesame.
Go, go, go!
Luna? Go.
Barney Ross says hello.
Nice job.
Trench, you copy?
I'm waiting.
Package secured.
Hurry up. It's boring.
Why don't you just put a bullet
in his head and be done with it?
Hey! Hey! Hey! You said
we were taking him in.
Oh! Good mornin'.
Are these your students?
Hey, kids. What'd you
learn tonight, huh?
Yeah, what happened
to the old crew?
Oh, that's right.
They stuck their noses
into other people's worlds
and got fatally injured.
Now they're the Deletables.
Hey! You hear that, kids?
Take note, 'cause that's
what you're doing right now.
Can we shut his mouth?
You're talking pretty tough to a guy who's
incapacitated, which is good for you.
- Is it?
- Why don't you cut me loose?
I'll open your meat shirt and
show you your own heart.
Hey, Barn.
Why don't the two of
us just end this?
What do you say?
Mix it up...
Either you snapping my spine
or me snapping yours.
You know?
Make it snappy.
He thinks I'm joking.
I'm not joking.
You should see me
when I'm angry.
You'd be very impressed.
Then very dead.
So, come on, pal. Anything you
wanna get off your chest?
Come on, lay it out.
I'm a good listener.
You gonna take me back
to the Has-Been Crew?
Carve me up around a fire?
Very tribal.
When we stop,
I'm gonna break every
bone in your body.
And drop what's
left at The Hague.
The Hague.
I finally made the big time.
I'm a war criminal.
Keep laughin'.
Ha.
Do you think that you can just
deliver me like a package?
We were close once.
See, we started this whole
Expendables thing together.
See? Look, I've got the marks.
A bit faded, but we
had a falling out.
You went dark.
It's a dark business, Barney.
Don't pretend you're not in it.
The baddest survive. Those are the rules.
I didn't make 'em up.
You see, Barney here was content to work
for the small-end money, as an employee.
Now, being boss is
more lucrative.
But that's a concept
that somehow eluded you.
Plus, you've got that
pesky moral conscience.
God, that stuff gets in the way.
He thinks he's the good guy.
- Keep talkin' while you can.
- Sure.
You got a conscience, and
that makes you weak.
Success, real success
is being willing to do the things
that other people are not.
Not everyone's as sick as you.
Oh, but you are.
Did you kill anyone today, Barn?
Blow any shit up?
How 'bout you, kids?
Kill anyone?
Before you all start grabbing
bricks to stone me at The Hague,
you might wanna check
your own hands for blood.
But I digress. Where was I?
Yes. Business is booming, right?
A chopper here, a missile there.
Guns, whatever.
When suddenly, a competitor, if you
can call Uncle Sam a competitor,
hires my own team, Barney and
the whole gang to whack me.
Things got ugly real fast and
a lot of people got dead.
Three former brothers-in-arms.
You shut your mouth.
Three Expendables, our brothers.
Men we ate with, fought
with, bled with.
Dead. He puts three
slugs into my chest.
Thank God for body armor.
Even I thought I was dead.
And then he boogies out
with the casualties.
All dead because you couldn't
stay out of my business!
- Shut your mouth!
- Barney! Barney!
Go on, do it!
- Go on!
- It's what he wants.
Oh, it's hard to fathom.
I can't believe you forgot.
What?
That it's hard to beat an enemy when
he's living inside your own head.
See, you tie me up
like an animal,
lead me to the slaughter.
You humiliate me, disgrace me.
Now, when the time
comes to kill you,
and it will, I will not use a
weapon, I will use my hands.
Because I want you to feel the
way that I feel right now.
Jesus, we were brothers.
Hey! Hey!
What's that?
It's a GPS tracker!
It's a GPS tracker!
How 'bout that?
Hold it!
We may need 'em. I need a body.
Find him.
What happened?
We found a shitstorm.
It's gonna get worse.
This came in for you
10 minutes ago.
<i>Hey, Barney!</i>
<i>My search party's dead, so I'm
taking it you're still with us.</i>
<i>Now, you should've killed
me when you had the chance</i>
<i>'cause that's your last window.
It's gone.</i>
<i>Now, I got something
to show you here.</i>
<i>We got Harpo, Groucho,</i>
<i>Gummo and Chica!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>Hey, give her a little
squeeze there, Krug.</i>
<i>She's so pretty.</i>
<i>Personally, I'd chalk it
up to collateral damage.</i>
<i>I don't give a fuck.
But I know you.</i>
<i>Forty-eight hours and
they're gone for good.</i>
<i>If you want 'em, come get 'em.</i>
What are you gonna do?
Looking a little
strung-out there, kids.
And this is what you get for being
pawns in Barney's moral chess game.
That one looks a little slack.
You know, I feel
most bad for you.
I don't give a
shit how you feel.
I do. I have a daughter.
I have feelings.
Anyway, you know,
when the CIA...
I presume that's who
you're working for.
The CIA. Am I right?
I bet you don't even know
who you're working for.
What, for Barney? Do you
know who he's working for?
Does he know who he's working...
It gets very confusing.
Anyway, when the CIA wanted guys
doing the dangerous work in the
dangerous places, they called us.
When they didn't wanna get their
hands dirty, they called us.
Yep. We cleared every
hotspot they had.
We bumped the bad guys so that the good
guys could roll in lookin' like heroes.
We killed a lot.
But we saved more lives than
you can possibly imagine.
Then, the boys on the Hill,
wanting no loose ends,
tried to bury me.
I was an American
working for America.
Was.
They'd eat their own children.
The lesson here is
never do business
with the government.
But I'm gonna save you that heartache.
You never will.
So you're getting your old team?
No, I burned that bridge.
You know, your pride is
gonna get you killed.
Better me than them.
- So, you're really gonna go back?
- Yeah.
- Alone?
- Yeah.
You're an idiot.
Thanks for showing up.
I guess our favors are done.
But you're still an idiot!
How the hell did you find me?
People talk. I hear things.
You got a mission.
I can help.
My name is Galgo.
Let me fill you in.
I am good.
Very good. At warfare.
You know, good memory.
Afraid of nothing.
I want to be your friend.
I don't need a friend.
Yes, you do. Everybody does.
You know, I don't have any friends.
That's why I know.
But besides my friendship issues, what
I really need now is something to do.
Well, not just anything,
but what I was born to do.
Best bet, this is
a one-way trip.
Excuse me, sir,
but one-way trip is
better than no way.
Which is the way I live now.
Help me with the crate.
Sir.
On the plane, Gogo.
On the plane. Yes, sir.
Gogo? No, I'm not Gogo.
No, Galgo.
- Galgo. Gogo sounds like a Parisian hooker.
- Galgo.
"I am the bridegroom of death."
Those are the lyrics of a
Spanish Legion old song
that we used to sing when we
were on a mission in Croatia.
You know, that's
where I met Mingo.
Yeah. The best point man ever.
Some kind of savant, you know.
No ambush this guy
couldn't sniff.
And under fire,
the coolest cat ever.
Just pure ice in his veins.
We were pinned down once,
like, two bullets left.
I looked over.
Not one bead of sweat.
Was cool.
Yeah.
Can I help you up there?
You're a mechanic now?
Of course I am a mechanic. I am
whatever you need me to be, sir.
Okay, then just be quiet.
Uh, yes, sir.
<i>Tiger.</i>
This sniper I knew, I mean, this
guy got it all figured out.
Wind speed, temperature.
Shit, barometric pressure.
But do you know what he said
was the most important?
- No.
- Patience.
- Really?
- Yeah, he said that.
This thing smells good. What is that?
Is it kerosene?
Gasoline? What is that?
- Aviation fuel.
- Aviation fuel.
It's good.
Oh.
<i>The best team member ever.</i>
His name was Torres. Holy shit.
You wouldn't believe what
this guy was capable to do.
Unbelievable. I'm telling you.
- Galgo.
- Yes, sir.
I think I know why
your team let you go.
You do? Really?
Yes!
Whoa...
Big plane.
Old, old, but cool, ya know.
- Where are the others?
- Just us.
- Just us?
- Just us.
Insane.
Courageous, but insane.
Last chance.
You sure you wanna do this?
I like traveling.
Good.
Uh... Who are those guys?
My old team.
What the hell are
you doing here?
You were stupid enough to get
yourself into this mess!
We're the only ones crazy
enough to get you out of it!
Come on.
We're late for a war!
Galgo, you might wanna get outta that seat.
Christmas is comin'.
But it's June.
Galgo, get the hell out!
Yes, sir. My hat and gloves.
Wow.
- I'm curious.
- What?
Since when did suicide
become your hobby?
I got a will.
You know, I'm probably the
only friend you've got.
I've got lots of friends.
You walk into a room,
people jump under tables.
I missed you, Christmas.
I missed you, too, you
demented bastard.
You could've left
the "demented" out.
It's a kind of a solid structure that
is taking us from one place to another
to unbelievable speeds.
Think about it! If God...
If God, if he would
have liked us,
you know, flying, he would
have given us feathers.
Do you have feathers?
Do you have feathers?
Do you have feathers?
I don't have feathers.
Damn. This is gonna be a
long-ass flight, fellas.
It's going to be.
It's going to be a long flight.
But don't worry. I'm here. Man,
because I can't sleep on planes.
Yeah.
<i>I thought you
should know, Barney,</i>
<i>you're walking into a shitstorm.</i>
NSA ran a signals and frequency
check on your team's phones.
This bastard's not even
trying to hide 'em.
- Where's he taken 'em?
- They're in Azmenistan.
Another honeymoon hotspot.
Who is that?
Lee Christmas.
Not far off, Christmas.
Stonebanks' compound is
where he trains his goons.
It's very heavily fortified.
What's up with the local army?
I don't understand a
word this guy is sayin'.
Local army status.
Small. Corrupt.
Stonebanks' has got all
the brass in his pocket.
Been running his
operations through
this shithole of a
country for years.
<i>- Want some advice?</i>
- What's the advice?
What goddamn language is that?
You know, to tell you the truth,
I don't understand you either.
Look who's talkin'.
What's the advice, Drummer?
Forget about what
you're thinking.
Remember our deal.
We need him alive.
So he can sit in a courtroom
and beat this on a technicality?
Those are orders, Barney.
- You broke the phone.
- I got another one.
Think we'll make it
back from this one?
You didn't have to
come along, Christmas.
Sure, I did.
Morons need friends.
Gentlemen, change of plans.
This is it? This
is your Evac team?
Short notice.
Yeah, very short.
Where's your team,
Major Drummer?
No team.
This one's off the books.
I'm not even here.
Nobody's here.
I thought Church was asshole.
The only army in the world.
Whoa. Guys, did I tell
you about Pepito?
Small name, big guy.
I saw him lift a deuce and
a half of a guy once.
I love that tattoo, man.
I like that kind of, black chicken that
you have there. What is that called?
A craw. The craw over the skull.
I love to do something...
Yeah. Hysterical strength.
Weird. Yes, sir. Weird concept.
I mean, if you are hysterically strong,
you don't even have to go to the gym.
You are just strong. You just got it.
You just got it.
But hysterical is a
concept that actually
was applied to women
in the 19th century.
It's a decimononic concept.
You know what I mean?
Wow. This is an
interesting place.
- He gave me a migraine.
- I hear that.
Don't you think?
A bit cold, too.
Look on the bright side.
You run out of bullets,
he can talk 'em to death.
Roger that.
Tall one doesn't like me.
- He doesn't like anybody.
- Yeah.
- What'd you say?
- He likes you.
What the hell is that?
- What?
- That computer strapped to your wrist?
Nothin'.
It's the same thing you were
busting that kid's balls about?
No, I had it for a while now.
Why'd your team let you go?
Oh.
Why does it matter now?
I wanna know who
I'm working with.
Well, they aren't
around anymore.
So, listen, um...
So why'd they let you go?
They didn't.
Benghazi.
I was not in the army
anymore and we were
retrieving a hostage,
something like...
Like we are doing
here, and, uh...
It was...
A beautiful day.
No problems.
And then it all went bad.
We got hit. Cut off.
Waited for support. No one came.
And...
Everybody died.
Except me.
Mingo,
Torres, and Tiger, right?
You were listening.
Yeah, I was listening.
Thank you.
So what do you think?
I think we should
get this over with.
Four signals.
Eight stories up.
This is way too wrong.
Sally don't like it.
You know he's got
eyes on us now.
May I suggest something?
- No.
- No, later.
That's what I thought.
It's fine.
Go!
Break it.
Oh, shit.
What the hell?
<i>Hey, Barn!</i>
<i>I knew you couldn't stay away.</i>
<i>But I'm relieved that someone
could pick up the kids.</i>
<i>You got 'em in there?</i>
<i>Now try getting 'em out.</i>
<i>But unfortunately for you,</i>
the entire complex has
been wired with C-4.
<i>It'd take a regular Joe about
90 seconds to get out of there.</i>
You've got... How 'bout 45?
He's turned this whole
place into a bomb.
Maybe not.
Hey!
9% battery power. You
didn't charge it?
Excuse me, but what
are you doing?
Just running some code.
Should be able to
jam the signal.
Why didn't you think of that?
Well, I use it to
check the weather.
Will you just shut up and
let him do his thing?
You sure you can do this, Thorn?
I can do it. I can do it.
<i>Yeah, kid, take your time.</i>
Come on, man.
Come on, come on.
Come on, dude.
- Come on. Come on!
- Come on!
- Come on. Come on, Thorn.
- Come on, Thorn.
Give me a Sec.
- Source is in.
- You can do it. Come on, Thorn.
<i>Come on, come on.</i>
Focus. Focus.
Got it!
<i>I take it back.</i>
We've lost override.
The signal is jammed.
Send 'em in.
Barney, the battery's at 8%. When
this thing dies, we lose override.
That gives us about
25 minutes, tops.
Don't pop the bottles yet.
Still got trouble.
- What?
- Big trouble.
<i>Lucky again, Bro.</i>
<i>But try to enjoy
the view because</i>
shortly, the building that
you're currently standing in
will be surrounded by
the Azmenistan army.
Oh, shit.
How did you shitheads manage
to get captured anyway?
Shut up!
Hey!
Step back!
It's not an accident
that we're trapped in here!
This is exactly what
he knew would happen.
Us tearing at each other.
<i>It stops now!</i>
We can do this.
But only if we do this
together.
If we work as a team,
we just may get out
of this alive.
Hmm.
Now, do you wanna make it work?
That simple.
You got any weapons?
Here's the plan.
We're gonna break up into small groups
and go out through
the ground floor.
Get ready!
Come on.
- Thorn, you stay with me. You take Galgo.
- I don't want to.
- What, what...
- Shh.
Don't stop. One there.
One there.
There's too many!
They're on our flank!
Bring it to 'em!
Bring it!
Enough's enough.
Light 'em up.
Incoming!
Up the shaft, Thorn. You gotta
protect that signal jammer.
I thought you could fight!
Whoo!
Jesus! You okay?
You okay?
Totally fine! Totally fine!
And full of energy. You
know, we are brothers now!
Good, keep moving!
Yes, sir!
Relax.
I told you you'd give
yourself a stroke.
Drummer?
You got a tank problem, pal.
Do something about it.
I'm on it.
Trench, on your right!
That's gotta hurt.
Drummer's in the house!
Hey. Look!
Let's go!
Time to pick up the tempo, boys.
Not good. Hold on.
This is not happening.
You wanna do something?
Pull me down! Pull me...
Oh, shit.
Hi, there.
Closer.
Closer.
Yang, hit something.
Excellent.
Your name is Luna, right?
Luna means "moon."
Hypnotic, mysterious,
magical, like yourself.
Would you like to hold my gun?
Come on, drive this thing!
My mom drove a tank
back in Sweden.
This one's for Caesar, assholes!
- Yeah!
- Damn, that's cool!
I had it all under control.
Yeah, that's what
it looked like.
Shit!
Come on!
This is the happiest
moment of my life!
Jing-a-Ling, jing-a-Ling.
You finished yet?
Ooh.
Men.
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Oh, God.
I've been thinking about
you the whole time.
- During the whole fight.
- Can we just go?
Come on.
Hold on!
Where did you learn how to fly?
Trench, you're on.
Barney!
We got reinforcements!
Shit!
Drummer, there's another wave coming.
The only way out is up.
On my way. Evac in five.
Got it!
Everybody get to the roof now!
Got it.
Trench. Yang. Come
on, clear the roof!
Let's go!
- Always this easy?
- Pretty much.
How hard can it be
to kill 10 men?
You think you could even
just wound a couple?
Watch closely.
And again.
Anybody else?
Useless bunch of...
If you want something
done right...
They got valet parking here?
Yeah, there's some right here.
Go, go, go!
Don't stop!
Come on, guys, move it!
Drummer, we're pinned down!
Stop mumbling.
Good morning!
Let's get to the chopper!
Let's go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Come on, move, go, go!
Gotta go, gotta go.
- Yang?
- You're welcome.
You're working for Trench?
Yeah. He pay me more money.
Who the hell are you?
I'm the guy that
just saved your ass.
Battery's at 2%.
<i>Hey, Barney, leaving so soon?</i>
<i>Come on, let's finish this.</i>
Ahhh!
How ya feelin'?
Come on, stand up.
You'll feel better.
Barney, where are you?
Lose the armor. I want
you to feel this.
Barney, we gotta go!
And don't even think about going for
that piece of garbage in the back.
Come on.
That's it.
That's it.
No, we don't need these, do we?
Come on.
<i>Barney, we've gotta go!</i>
Battery's at 1%!
Come on, Barney!
Motherfucker.
What about The Hague, huh?
I am The Hague.
Battery's gone!
Gotta go! Gotta go!
No! No, wait! Wait!
Can't wait!
Go!
Come on, Barney! Go!
What the hell?
You owe me, Barney.
- Barney!
- Barney!
Holy...
Whoo!
Pull me up!
You gonna fire us again, Barney?
Come on!
Can't hear you, pal.
I'm gonna kill you.
All right, I'm sorry!
Pull me up, you idiots!
Don't pull him up.
To Caesar!
Caesar!
Yeah!
- Hey, yo, Barney.
- Yeah.
I don't think I'm gonna
be needing this anymore.
You want your luck back?
I hope I didn't stretch it.
I think you did stretch it.
- Good to have you back, man.
- Good to be back.
Don't scare us like
that anymore, okay?
- Hale Caesar.
- To me!
You never got him to The Hague.
You know, Drummer, working
with you ain't been so bad.
I haven't had so
much fun in years.
Fun's important.
These guys are nuts.
Our powers combined...
Is that a Captain Planet reference?
- I'm fire.
- Yeah, you are.
Come on, if you had
to be a Planeteer...
Are you calling Captain Planet?
Whoa.
Major old-school.
Hey, Major Badass.
I'll drink to that.
I am sure
I have done enough that I am worth
my weight in gold, you know.
Am I close? And since
I am as crazy as you,
uh, I am sure I'll fit in.
- Galgo.
- Yes, sir.
Welcome aboard.
Thank God!
Because I already spent a fortune on this.
You know what I mean?
I am so happy!
Barney, thank you. Yeah.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no hugging, no.
No hugging. No hugging.
- No hugging. No, no, no, no, no.
- No. No hugging.
Ooh.
Best two out of three.
Hey.
Hey.
Just wanted to say thanks.
- For what?
- For caring.
Oh, come on.
Yeah. Thanks.
You know, if you were
30 years younger...
I'd be afraid of you.
Here, cheers.
Hey, Yang. Looks like
you had a growth spurt.
Tall people don't live long.
So you're working
for Trench now.
And you, I thought you retired.
- I lied.
- Good.
You guys wanna get a room?
We don't need any rooms.
So jealous.
We came into this thing together,
we gonna leave here together.
- Hear me?
- Absolutely.
Cheers.
You know, for a guy that
doesn't take orders very well,
you did pretty good.
Yeah?
So when do I take over?
Keep drinkin'.
Hey, Smilee!
Get over here.
You did good, kid.

You look like a proud,

You coulda skipped
the "demented" part.
It was a compliment.
