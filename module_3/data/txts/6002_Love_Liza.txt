Okay? Okay
Sleeping's important
Have you ever slept
in a strange spot?
Yes, I have
I shouldn't make you move
- What did she say?
- You want to read it? Go ahead
- It doesn't have my name on it
- You're right It doesn't
But if it did, I would open it
- because that's what she wants
- Wanted What she wanted
- You refuse to honour that
- Is there something you wanna know?
There's something
you don't wanna know
I don't! I don't!
I loved well! I did!

- Is it closed?
- They're probably inside
- Should we sit and wait for them?
- It could be a while
- Hours?
Let's walk over to the seal part
And so it's difficult to plan
when to see the sun bears?
- Yeah
- I'm walking over to the seal part
Wilson
I don't think she knows
what she's talking about
Tom Bailey just loves your work
and he's willing to give you
as much time as you need, so
This is totally inappropriate
What?
No, not this
Not what?
Sitting here
Great

what I was about to say
You gonna say
something inappropriate?
Totally inappropriate
- Totally inappropriate?
- But I'm gonna say it anyway
I'm attracted to you
- I should...
- Listen
- I didn't mean it like that
- Because...
You don't have to say anything
Absolutely nothing

inappropriate Totally

There's one in Little Rock,

Where's the one this weekend?
Slidell
Hey!
Hey, I'm going to Slidell!
Are you going to Slidell?
Oh, no, no,
I know how to get to Slidell
Are you going to the regional?
Look! I got a plane!
I'll see you there!
I've never seen food so big
That's why I made so much
I knew you were coming
- You knew I was coming?
- Sure
The plates are right there
If I could have kept him here,
I would have
- You do understand that?
- Right, exactly But how did he quit?
- He left
- How? Why?
You're not telling me anything
He's not at his house
He's not at his job He's disappeared
- Does that register? I mean, does it?
- Yes! Yes!
Okay, so when he said, " I quit,"
you didn't ask him why?
- You didn't say anything?
- I didn't get a chance to
You're full of bullshit
Know why I know you're full of bullshit?
Because he's distraught
and I'm distraught
and you're sitting on your ass
not giving a damn where he is
- because you can't stop this bullshit!
- I told him I liked him
- You told him you liked him
- Yes
You told him
you wanted to be his girlfriend
Not exactly that
You want a date?
Date this guy Hey, come here
This is Maura
You probably know Maura
She's looking for a date
She asked Wilson for a date
and now he's nowhere to be found
which I think we can all say
is a big " no"
So if you'll excuse me now
I'm gonna try to find
my son-in-law, who needs help
I would imagine,
dealing with the loss of his wife
Sorry
Go Go Go Go Go
Stay hydro Stay hydro
Minutes
Good morning
I was already here

- All day long
- Do they race planes?

Do they have swimming?
Nobody does, really
You know, with all the boats
Not really
Somebody's in the water
Stop the boats
Somebody's in the water
Hey!
Get out of there, sir
Hey! There's no swimming today!
- I saw swimming
- They had to go too!
We can't have swimmers
when we hold races
- I'll stay away!
- We can't have you in the water
I'm a great swimmer
I'll stay out of the way
- I won't bother the race
- Swim later!
Do you know who I am?
I am a big fan of radio control!
I got a plane in my car!
Hey! What are you doing here?
Not jumping in the lake,
pissing people off
That race will be disqualified
You have to leave!
- You have to leave
- He's all right
- This is great
- Are they together?
This woman made me eggs
Louis, call the cops
and get him out of here
No, he's sick
He's okay He's with me
No, I'm great
You can't just do anything you want
We have insurance rules we have
to abide by, and when they...

She blew her head off, okay?
Now we'll be cool, okay?
Come on
- Strange seeing you here
- Yeah, well, I'm a member
- Yeah?
- Yeah
I wanna be a member
Can you sign up somewhere?
Well, I don't think
you could sign up now
What do you think?
Yeah, I guess
Here, check this out
That's yours?
- Check it out
- Wow!
- This is the bad-boy boat, Wilson
- Try it out yet?
- Did I try it out yet?
- Have you?
I won my prelim
Is that trying it out?
- What?
- My prelim
What's a prelim?
- I won my race
- You did! Really?
This morning
It's just a prelim
Quarters are today, 5:00
- This is in the quarters?
- Yeah
- You can't swim in the quarters
- I won't
- No swimming
- That's great
- 5:00
- Today
It doesn't matter, Wilson, because
I won my quarters, and that's it
I won my quarters
and I can go into the semis
tomorrow and I can be loose
I might do very well
'cause I don't give a shit
It's all just gravy on the...
Icing on the cake
When you win quarters,
you race on Sunday
Everybody can race on Saturday,
so that doesn't matter
When you race on Sunday,
it means you won
I don't care if I come in last
I don't care
because I already won
So I will definitely be loose
- Have fun
- Yeah
What time is it tomorrow?
Noon
Noon
I have all morning to prep
- That's good
- Yeah
- I have all morning...
- Yeah
To prep
Hey!
I'm sorry
I want to start a fire
Well, don't use my fuel
- You wanna start a fire?
- Yeah
Why?
I don't know
Hi
Is Liza here?
No
No, she's not
I'm Mary Ann
I'm Liza's mother
You're Liza's mom?
- I'm Mary
- Yeah?
Is Wilson here?
No
No
He's not here either
They're both gone
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Let go! I got...
Did your wife do
what your friend said she did?
Maybe not exactly
like he said, but
yeah
- I'm really sorry
- Yeah
- Why'd she do it?
- God, shut up, Stacy! God!
I don't know
She wrote me a letter,
but I can't read it
She probably wrote some really
cool stuff about you in there
- About the both of you, even though...
- You can tell
I wouldn't wanna read it
Like, " Here you go, read it"
Oh, my God! No way
It's cool that you miss her so much
Oh-fucking-well
Second-to-last place
I am fucking out of here
- Losers don't stay for finals
- Well, nobody else is leaving
Do tennis players stay
and watch other tennis players win?
- I don't know
- No, they don't
Losers leave
You didn't
" lose" lose
I'm not in the finals, which means
we don't have to drive in the dark
That's cool I'm cool,
but I'm out of here
Okay
Hey, someone left you a letter
What?
Yeah I found it when I got up
I forgot
- Where is it?
- I put it in here so it wouldn't get wet
You ain't gonna open it?
I'm an idiot
It's from my wife
- I don't think so, Wilson
- No
- She left it for me
- Not here, obviously
- No, not here
- Good
I thought you were more fucked up
than I thought you were
She left it for me
You haven't opened it?
- I should probably just open it here
- Now?
I don't know
We might not be able
to drive afterward
You ain't gonna open that thing
in here, are you?
- Why not?
- Because it's stupid
- Why's it stupid?
- First off, because I'm in here
- I don't care if you're here
- Well, I do!
Why?
I don't wanna be here when you open
a letter from a person who shot herself
Excuse me,
but it scares the shit out of me
She didn't shoot herself
That's why cops
and psychologists do that
because they've been trained
to do that
Yeah, you're probably right
You can't open it here
in a bathroom
- You're in a public bathroom
- It's stupid
No, you need to open this
near some candles or something
With a dog, you know, or a priest
But not here
Jesus Christ, not here
I wouldn't wanna open it
No way
I mean, who the hell
wants to know, really?
Especially you
Oh, God!
I gotta take a mean shit
Always after camping,
gets all backed up
Hey, Wilson
- You got a phone call
- What?
It's some lady
Hello?
And a guy named Tom Bailey
called me about a job for you
- He did?
- Yeah
I guess your old boss gave him
your number, or my number
I haven't read the letter yet
That's hilarious
- Hey, run out of gas again?
- Yeah
- Five dollars on two
- Hey, you fly those planes
- Yeah
- That's wild
- Sometimes the gas is for that
- Gas is for what?
You know, sometimes I come in...
Sometimes it's for the planes
You know,
sometimes it's for the planes
The two planes my buddy's got
don't use gas
- Synthetic blend?
- Yeah
They don't run on gas
What the hell have I told you?
Go somewhere else!
Do it somewhere else!
Do it somewhere else!
- This is simple stuff
- I can't believe it
- This is simple stuff
- I can't believe it
- I did this two years ago
- You're kidding
Sure I can generate pop-ups
with the new Java
which can maintain several
windows simultaneously
And you can count unique
users within each one
And I can throw in
a half-dozen firewalls
so guys can't steal jack shit
- I was trying to track you down
- Yeah I heard you called
How was your vacation?
Good
- You look great
- I do?
- I think
- You do
So maybe we can just set you up
at your house
and you could get started
I'm really happy about this
Me too
- All right
- Thank you
Oh, fuck
Fuck
No!
Oh, God, no!

- Are you getting high on the gas?
- No Fuck that, Denny

What the fuck are you doing?
