Late summer, 1942.
World War II enters its 4th year.
Hitler's armies occupy most of
Europe and part of North Africa.
Russia faces its second large
offensive of the summer.
Its goal: The Caspian Sea and the
oil fields of the Caucus region.
General Paulus' 6th Battalion moves
quickly towards the cities of the
Volga, where the bloodiest massacre
this century is about to take place:
Stalingrad.
Porto Corvo (Italy), August of 1942.
Hearts are winners.
Yes, Lieutenant.
Onward and upward.
It's warm. It tastes like piss.
- You'll roast in the sun.
- Fish food.
- That's enough, Lupo.
- Sit down.
Sorry, Lieutenant.
No, no, you need a spade,
not a heart.
Onward and upward, Rollo.
Will you let me dry you?
- This one's mine.
- No, no.
- Who won?
- I did.
When are you going to throw out
that camel piss?
It was a going-away present.
For a tenner I can get you one.
For ten marks I'd buy a whole damn
palm tree and plant it on your head.
You always have the best cards
and I'm out.
I told you not to bring him.
I think you're the one
with the broken head.
It's his last day.
- Let him play.
- His old lady's in for a surprise.
Lupo!
The doctor told him not to drink.
- He'll have a headache anyway.
- Good wine.
What time is it?
One. We can still find a whore,
right Lieutenant?
Look at all those women.
- And that present for your wife?
- That'll just take a second.
They're calling formation.
Help me with the Lieutenant.
Another formation.
What a drag.
Careful! That's my bottle.
Careful.
I can't see anything.
What kind of fucking watch
did you sell me?
Waterproof to 30 meters...
You still gotta wind it.
We'll take him like this.
Grab the chair.
We'll do it this way.
What about my jacket?
Come on, guys. Move it.
- What about my jacket?
- What about my jacket?
Careful!
Men:
The Fuhrer sent me to tell
all of you,
infantry, artillery, or grenadier,
you fought brilliantly in Africa.
Pushing the English back to the Nile
wouldn't have been possible without
your valient efforts. Foremost
in bravery were the Rangers.
You were chosen
because you are the best.
Never forget that.
New missions now await you.
But first,
you will form the core of a new,
elite fighting company.
But before you leave,
let me present you,
in the name of the Fuhrer,
with a medal for your
exceptional service in the difficult
victories around El Alamein.
Men, this is the new
Platoon Commander
for Second Company's 1st Platoon.
Lieutenant Von Witzland.
1st Platoon,
step forward!
Atten... hut!
Captain, decorate your men.
Why were you late, Private?
Hospital visit.
Your predecessor, sir.
Heros aren't late, Private.
Remember that in the future.
Sergeant,
do you intend to accept the award
in this appaling condition?
- Yes, sir.
- The award is revoked.
Battalion dismissed.
Dismissed!
Rangers, be ready to move out
in half an hour.
Battalion dismissed!
Don't leave, men.
Come back!
Take me with you!
You men are dismissed!
Viola!
Good bye, my love.
Hey, Fritz.
Are you in love?
When's the wedding?
Dearest Clara,
Russia.
Two thousand kilometers
already separate us.
The vastness of the distance
is overwhelming.
I probably won't hear from you
again for quite some time.
You should write, of course,
although it will take a long time
for your letters to arrive.
Will it be hard for you?
I know if it had been up to you,
I'd be sitting
in a leather armchair
in your father's office right now
instead of in the fresh straw
on the floor of a train.
Please forgive me,
and try to understand my happiness.
The uncertainty of the last
few months has vanished.
Suddenly my life has
real meaning, a goal.
Everything before seemed
insignificant.
But as I approach the front,
the melancholy disappears
and the feelings flourish again,
especially my feelings towards you.
You should see me,
sitting surrounded by these
simple country boys.
My men.
Only through unceasing effort
will I earn their respect.
If you were here beside me,
you'd probably faint from the smell.
Can't you count?
You gave him the ten.
Cut him a break.
Lupo's skull was caved in
and he still played better than you.
He's still learning.
He just can't deal with
my brilliant strategy, right Rollo?
Hey, that's mine!
Not anymore.
Anyone know where this shitpile
on wheels is headed?
How about Stalingrad, gentlemen?
We'll teach Ivan a lesson.
We'll take the city in three days.
Were you always so stupid?
I could swear we passed this exact
same spot ten hours ago.
Russia certainly is large.
After the war,
they'll give us farms here.
Big ones, with 100 acres
and 10 wenches each.
Here?
- Not if you paid me.
- Then stay in your pisshole village.
Look!
They're working for us already.
Let's go, men!
Dig faster!
- How do you say "faster"?
- "Davai".
That's all you gotta know here.
Adolf will build us a roadway
to Kirkov, or whatever it's called.
This vast country is just aching
for someone with a fleet of trucks.
That's enough, Rieser.
It's touching that our lieutenant
is keeping us company back here.
Permission to ask a question, sir?
Go ahead.
Is this your first time
to the front?
- There's a first time for everyone.
- That's funny.
Make a bet with you, sir.
I come out alive and you don't.
How much?
From you...
two cases of spring water.
Accepted.
And just how's the loser
supposed to pay?
How nice.
And we haven't even got
to Stalingrad yet.
Do you think I'm going
to carry you?
Move it!
Get up, you stupid Russian pig!
What are you waiting for?
Enough! Leave him alone.
Captain,
I must protest strongly
to the behaviour of your men.
You want to protest?
Fine. Write the Fuhrer.
Lieutenant! Over here!
Lieutenant Von Witzland, Ranger
Battalion 336, 1st Platoon.
Welcome to Stalingrad.
All the specialists
are finally here.
Let me introduce Sergeant Pflüger.
These gentlemen just arrived
from Voronezh.
I'm pleased you made it on time,
Lieutenant.
Now we can both push Ivan into
the Volga. Teach him how to swim.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
I'd like to report an incident which
occurred on the loading platform.
I've already heard. It seems
you're very fond of the Russians.
Forget it.
See that the men are issued ammo
and grenades as soon as possible.
There will be a meeting
for the officers later.
Your uncle, Colonel Von Witzland,
is a good friend of mine.
He asked me to keep an eye on you.
"God is with us".
It's engraved on every
German soldier's belt buckle.
No shit. I hadn't noticed.
The holiest of all tasks
is to defend the Christian values
of Western Civilization
against the Bolsheviks
from the Far East.
And that's what distinguishes you
from the Bolshevik
who has no room
on his belt buckle for God.
You are never alone,
even when deep in enemy territory.
Come on, Müller!
Yes, sir.
They're crazy.
They're killing their own men.
Damned artillery.
Get down!
He's crazy.
Relax, boys. Follow me.
That factory is our target,
whatever it costs.
We'll start with that machine gun
on the right.
When we shoot,
the Russians hide.
- Can you see anything?
- It looks suspicious.
Here, Captain.
We're at Frieda 20.
Cease fire.
I repeat, hold your fire.
Where are the five cannons?
We can't see anything,
as usual.
At your service,
Commander.
All clear to the second point.
Keep quiet and hold your fire.
Understood?
Come on, boys. Follow me.
Shit!
You're a fool, Feldmann.
It wasn't my fault.
They would have heard us.
I'm sorry.
Shit!
Erwin!
It's no use. He's dead.
Take cover!
They're better than ours.
They don't get stuck.
Cheer up!
Go kill a Russian.
Smoke them out.
Take cover!
Fire that way!
Watch the gasoline!
Keep going.
We're almost there.
Come on, keep going!
What's wrong with you?
Move it!
That way! Come on!
I can't! I can't!
Get out of there!
Control yourself, you fool!
Leave him.
Get his tags and let's go.
If you're not coming, I'm leaving.
I can't help you.
Go ahead and get killed.
Keep going! Come on!
I told you, you idiot.
Follow me!
It's impossible, Captain.
Nothing's impossible, Lieutenant.
Get me a smoke grenade.
Smoke grenades!
We have to silence that cannon.
Smoke grenades, Fritz.
He's right. It's impossible.
Now you can make up for everything.
You want your wife to be proud
of you when you return, don't you?
Let me go, sir.
No, I'll go.
I won't let you down, Captain.
I know, son.
We'll cover you.
Run!
They owed us one.
Let's go, men!
Now we'll show them.
Pflüger, take the left.
Witzland, take the right.
Let's go! Follow me!
Cover us.
Shoot anything that moves.
Come on, Fritz.
Dieter.
I shot him.
Shoot me! Please!
Hands up! Come on! Davai!
Ruki vyerkh!
Come on!
I killed my friend!
I killed him!
I killed him!
- I don't deserve to live!
- So what? Shut up already.
Calm down.
It was an accident.
It's normal in battles.
If he'd been Russian,
you'd be dead.
Mother, I'm sorry I left you alone.
Mother, stay with me.
What do I have to do...
to keep us together?
Mother...
Wait.
Pflüger, come back!
Take cover!
Bring me some gas cans.
Next target: Control room.
6:00 German time.
I need two volunteers.
- We'll go.
- Good.
Come on, push!
One, two, go!
We'll get the Iron Cross for this.
They'll look great on your coffins.
Take cover!
Shit. My mother would die
if I were wounded.
Here comes my medal.
What are you waiting for?
You want to lose another 300 men?
Go in there and fight!
Cover the exits!
Stay where you are!
Don't move!
I shit myself.
I shit in my pants.
You're not the only one.
I wanted to reach not just
the Volga, but a certain
spot on the Volga,
a certain city.
By coincidence this city
bears the name of Stalin himself,
but that is not the reason
I marched there.
It wasn't the name, but the fact
that it's a very important point.
From there we cut off
30 million tons
of commerce, almost
9 million tons of oil.
All the wheat from the Ukraine came
there before being shipped north.
Manganese ore was mined there.
It was an enormous shipping center.
I wanted that city,
and in all modesty, now we have it.
As you all know,
we don't ask so much of you.
We've done it. Only a very few
pockets of resistence remain.
Some people say:
"Why don't you fight faster?"
I don't want a second Verdun.
I'd rather fight with very small
combat patrols.
Time doesn't matter.
What matters is cutting off
the Volga.
We have to keep an eye on Ivan.
"Small combat patrols".
- What did you say?
- Only 62 left.
And for your information,
we started with 400 men.
Why not broadcast it?
Boost morale.
At least we've got Ivan's stove.
Damned studdering.
Better to studder
than freeze your ass off.
That's true.
Congratulations.
You're still alive.
Have a cigarrette.
- It won't make me less afraid.
- Asshole.
What are you thinking about?
I'm not.
If you start thinking,
you go crazy.
So I don't.
Have a drink.
You've got a little switch
right here. Just turn it,
and you stop thinking.
I'm sorry.
Be glad you can still cry.
Go on, cry. It's good for you.
What's you name?
Müller.
We've got too many of those.
At least until the next attack.
You're a go-getter, Müller.
Go-getter Müller.
You feeling any better?
What's going on?
Couple of wounded Ivans moaning.
The Russians tried to get them,
so I shot.
They'd do the same to us.
Can anyone speak Russian?
Me, sir.
Call over and ask if they want
a short truce
to get the wounded.
Excuse me sir, but that's forbidden.
The captain
would never allow it.
Shut up, Müller.
Or I'll baptize you again.
I was only telling you
our standard procedure.
Nobody in this city cares
about standard procedure.
Go ahead, Wölk.
That's an order.
Our Lieutenant asks
do you want to get the wounded?
We have to go first.
I'm not going out there.
Me neither.
- Emigholz.
- Yes, sir.
Spread the word for our men
to hold their fire.
We'll need medics.
Bee One to Colmena. Hold your fire.
We need medics.
I'll go with you.
You'd better stay.
You're better off here.
You look like my son.
- How old's your son?
- Three.
Let me go.
It's me. Kolya.
I'll help you. Don't die.
Sons of bitches!
Cover them!
Aim for the windows!
God damnit!
Hand grenades!
- Shoot!
- Run!
Don't shoot!
Hold your fire!
You'll get the Iron Cross for this.
Who fired?
Who fired?
Relax.
The Russians were going to attack.
When I saw them, I shot.
- You asshole!
- He's right, Lieutenant.
I'll court martial you for this!
Go ahead, sir.
And I'll tell them about your
illicit contact with the enemy.
We don't need a fucking court!
Let's just send the bastard
upstairs.
He'll get in the paper all right.
The obituaries.
Asshole.
You're an asshole.
Always sleeping.
My shaving kit.
Who took it?
You'e still our pretty boy.
You ever think of posing for
the cover of "Today's Army"?
Food!
False alarm.
They were throwing it away.
Letters! Great!
Let's have them.
What did they bring us?
Horseshit again.
Those guys are fucking insane.
They're the ones
who should eat this.
Stop complaining, Rollo.
Yeah, I know.
We're the beasts who invaded Russia.
I've got something for you, Rollo.
No letter?
She said she's had the baby again.
That was in her last letter.
But not a word about the cow
that's supposed to calve.
Oh, well. She's not the brightest...
But the smallest.
- He married a Lilliputian.
- So what?
At least she loves me.
If only I knew that my cow was okay.
Listen up.
Somebody's been stealing my eggs.
They should hang the bastard.
Look who's talking.
- You ransack every Russian we kill.
- That's different.
We're at war.
Back home, they've got peace.
There's a letter for you.
Asshole.
From your wife?
She's sitting at home watching
the furniture.
Schalke beat Hannover 3 to 1.
Alemania lost again.
That's in your letter?
When the war's over, I'm going
to play halfback at Stuttgart.
I've already had a tryout.
Soccer's bullshit.
I have a rowboat.
A two-seater.
My old lady rows and I watch
the scenery go by.
By evening, she's tired and quiet.
I have one too.
Hares or rabbits?
Big.
His boots. Bad nails.
Too cold.
Russian winter.
I can fix.
Me cobbler.
Father cobbler.
Grandfather cobbler.
Quiet!
How do you say "quiet" in Russian?
Let them sing. It sounds nice.
Bread.
Hey, Rollo.
Grandpa sent me some beeswax.
Old wive's remedy for rheumatism.
Something happen at home?
Bomber attack?
You could say that.
While I'm risking my ass
for the fatherland,
she shacks up with a Frenchman.
A P.O.W.!
That's illegal.
Are you sure?
Maybe it's just a rumor.
She wrote me personally.
She wanted to tell me
before her mother did.
We wasted those French bastards
in six fucking weeks.
She's afraid, of course.
I'll make the Russians pay for this.
But he's French.
Who gives a fuck?
- What's up?
- Nothing, leave him alone.
His wife's fucking around.
Fuck you!
You're all against me!
Especially you, Lieutenant. You
think I'm a stupid country asshole.
- Leave me alone.
- You're my best man, Rohleder.
Without you, we'd be dead already.
You'd have won your bet.
Lieutenant, follow us!
Cover the doors!
Damn it, Wölk, cover the doors!
Russians everywhere.
We have to go that way.
Reiser!
Yes, sir.
There's no contact, sir.
Get your flamethrowers.
Just us, sir?
We'll follow. Wölk!
Yes, sir.
You're in command. If we're not back
in 2 hours, try to break through.
- Time?
- 7:00 German time.
Why me?
I'm the radio man.
Sir, let me go along.
- What for?
- Let him come. He'll bring us luck.
Fine.
Emigholz, the flamethrowers.
Hands up!
Get them up!
You're surrounded.
If I scream,
you're dead.
And so are you.
At lease pronounce it right.
Is he dead?
He's dead, all right.
You're experts at killing.
Shut up or I'll kill you.
If you do you're dead.
You'll never get out of here.
Come.
- It's not that way.
- Don't try...
How about a truce?
I'll help you, and you'll let me go.
Why should I trust you?
I could have killed you.
With this?
Yes, with that.
Wait!
And the other boot?
My spoon.
You want it, Lieutenant?
How do you know German?
All right.
You have my word as an officer.
If you get me out of here,
I'll let you go.
You first.
Naturally.
Slowly.
- Are you all right?
- Shit, Reiser.
We have to continue.
Thanks, Reiser. I won't forget it.
And Emigholz?
- Help!
- There he is.
My leg!
Shut up!
I'll kill him myself.
Your leg's fine.
Okay, Müller.
Keep moving.
We have to get out of here.
Move! Keep walking!
- And the Germans?
- They went that way.
Take care, baby.
Thanks, man.
Doctor!
What is it?
Who's tending to the wounded?
Who knows?
The Russians passed through.
Down by Romania, I think.
- Get me out of here.
- Lie down.
- Stay still. I'll get a doctor.
- My boots.
- Where's a doctor?
- I don't know.
I need a doctor.
Doctor!
- I'm not a doctor.
- Come here.
Get to work!
Reiser, put the gun away!
And let him die?
All of them?
- Do something!
- I'm not a doctor.
Not another word!
Everyone shut up!
Get to work!
The doctor's here.
Help me.
Drop your weapon.
Captain, let me explain.
- Explain what?
- We just came from the front, sir.
- Shut up.
- We risked our life for him.
Where is Schroeder?
Where's my bag and jacket?
I expect a detailed report
about this incident, Captain.
You'll get it, sir.
He's dead.
I don't believe it.
All this shit for nothing.
You're all under arrest.
Take their weapons.
What happens to us now?
This isn't what I wanted.
Captain, I request a meeting
with General Hentz.
You think you're so fucking special.
But it's your right, I suppose.
God damned Russian sympathizer.
Take them away.
To be soldierly and brief,
gentlemen,
we're in deep shit.
Day before yesterday, the Russians
broke through the line in the north.
And they've now broken through
in the south, too.
We must assume they will try to
close the circle around Kalatsch.
If they succeed, we'll be
sitting ducks, gentlemen.
Keep smoking, Krüger.
Captain, you have to help me.
Part of my group has been arrested.
One wounded.
Reiser threatened the doctor and...
Can't you report concisely?
We were trapped, sir.
The entire 6th Army is trapped,
Lieutenant.
We're trying to decide the fate
of an army,
and you're whining about
a couple men!
You can't do this, sir.
The men believed in you.
They fought for you.
Are we nothing more than a flag
on you God damned map?
Excuse me, General.
What's going on?
It's about the incident
at the hospital.
Apparently some of my men used force
to get professional treatment
- for one of their soldiers.
- Isn't that the young Witzland?
Nasty business
you got yourself into.
Will we be court-martialed, sir?
You can't expect us to overlook
your behavior.
December 1942. The 6th Army's
been surrounded 6 weeks.
Midgets.
What's going on here?
Why isn't there
a clear path?
- Look at all those medals.
- You like them, Rollo?
Ask him if you can touch one.
Asshole.
It's your fault we're here.
Save your strength for the front.
We need every man we can get.
Everyone in the truck.
Hurry up!
You, too.
But I...
That's an order!
Since it's Christmas, I'm going
to give every able-bodied man
a piece of sausage and some bread.
But only if you ask me
for it nicely.
Say "please",
my former Lieutenant.
Please.
Merry Christmas.
Get out of the truck!
Out!
Are you crazy?
You'll never make it to the front.
Get out or I'll shoot.
Go ahead.
What do I care?
- Leave him.
- Go to hell.
Ivan'll finish the job.
- What's this?
- Hermann...
What's are you doing?
This man was shirking his duty.
Get out of my sight!
Lieutenant, this is suicide.
- I refuse.
- Then go home.
Rollo, I can't take it anymore.
Calm down.
We're sick of it.
We can't handle it.
Kill us all.
What's the difference?
Calm down!
Listen!
The Russians are trying
to push us back.
Knight's Cross.
Despite heavy losses,
we held our positions.
They'll try again
as soon as it's light,
and without your help, we'll fold.
Now why is this position
so important?
Because it's our last chance
to break through
to General Hoth's Panzer division
which is just a few kilometers away.
And as you all know,
if we don't reach them, we're dead.
I ask you:
Do you want to fight or
die of starvation
and be responsible for the deaths of
30,000 of your comrades?
Think about it, men.
Is it worth fighting for?
Some choice.
We're going to make it, Fritz.
As long as you lead us, Captain,
we'll fight.
But if you fall,
all bets are off.
Agreed.
We'll give these five prisoners
a chance to redeem themselves.
I promise you'll be honourably
reinstated to duty after the battle.
Witzland, give me your word
as a German officer.
Yes sir, Captain.
All right.
Get ammunition
and form two platoons.
Wolk will lead the first platoon,
Müller, the second.
Just a moment.
We don't stand a chance.
Why don't you surrender?
You know exactly what
would happen to us if we did.
Do we deserve any better?
I'm not a Nazi, Otto.
No. You're even worse.
You damned officers
knew exactly who you were
getting involved with,
and you went along anyway.
I warned you of what would happen.
If I live through this,
I'll forgive my wife.
I had them tell mine I was dead.
It's for the best, believe me.
But we'll make it home someday.
So what?
I'll tell you a Christmas story.
Exactly one year ago today
was the last time I was home.
Special Christmas leave
because I destroyed three tanks.
My wife and kids
met me at the station.
They were more foreign to me
than any of you bastards.
She tried to understand,
tried to be tender.
But the more she tried
to understand,
the more I hated her.
Finally I ran off
and got drunk.
What could I do?
My wife wasn't sorry
when I left the next day.
Although the kids were.
I got back just in time
for the new Russian offensive.
And I felt like I was home again.
Here's the scoop.
Don't mess with the officers.
Us grunts gotta stick together.
- I finished high school.
- It doesn't show.
Tanks!
- Who's got the grenades?
- Rollo.
I look like my grandmother.
- Rollo, grenades.
- Have fun.
Fire!
Get your ass down!
Fire!
Who's got the artillery?
You're the artillery.
Get out! Get out now!
- I want out! Let me out!
- Get a hold of yourself!
Get down!
Rohleder, come back!
Let's go!
The big one!
They fit.
God damnit.
I liked that gun.
Are you okay, sir?
Russian shells always veer
to the right.
I was lucky.
This is the last cigar, gentlemen.
Let's share it.
Thanks, Captain.
All right, men. Back to camp.
Now we're waiting for Hoth's army.
Let's take the cannon with us.
Do we have horses?
Yes, we're the horses.
Everyone out! Let's go!
Close the door, it's cold.
Permission cancelled.
We're staying here.
You're crazy!
Everyone out!
You're shitting, aren't you?
All right! I'm a coward.
I only do what I have to do.
This whole thing makes me sick.
Where's my pay?
If I don't get my 36 marks for
three months and a day,
I'm going home!
- Even if I have to walk!
- Calm down, Fritz.
The Russian Army must be stopped.
The party isn't over yet.
Come on! Faster!
Move it, you grunts!
In the name of the Fuhrer.
Follow the order.
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.
We're not finished, Lieutenant.
Follow me with your men.
Gentlemen...
Come on! This way!
How can they...?
It's to remind us
which side we're on.
Listen!
These Russian civilians
have been found
guilty of sabotage.
They must face
the firing squad.
Ready!
They started yesterday.
Sabotage my ass.
They're running out of food,
that's the reason.
I can't do this.
If you don't,
you'll be up there next.
It's not worth it, kid.
Put them out of their misery.
I can't.
That boy. He helped us.
And the Russians, too.
Keep quiet.
What the fuck is this?
We must hurry.
There are more of them.
Please, Captain.
I can vouch for the boy.
You again?
Do you like this boy?
Maybe he reminds you of someone?
- Child-killer!
- Shut up, asshole.
You want to be arrested again?
Return to your post.
- You're an officer. Do something.
- Right.
Silence!
Come closer, Private.
I'll kill that son of a bitch.
Step forward.
Let me take his place, sir.
Stand staight when I talk to you.
Are you refusing to carry out
a direct order?
Let the boy go, sir.
That's enough!
There's nothing to discuss.
If you miss,
you'll be next.
Get back in line,
Private.
Would you like to give the order?
To think he's from
a military family.
Aim!
Do something, Fritz.
We'll go to the airport.
I'll get out of here, even if I have
to shoot myself in the stomach.
Calm down, Fritz.
I mean it! I'm getting out of here!
Do you know what you're saying?
That's desertion!
Lieutenant, talk some sense
into him.
I don't care about my oath anymore.
After everything that's happened,
I think you have a right to leave.
You're doing it again!
Well I'm not going to let you.
Not this time.
I've had enough of your shit.
You're not being reasonable.
You're just scared, Rollo.
Kill me.
You're a sergeant.
It's your duty.
- Freeze!
- I pity you, Rohleder.
Fight to the end.
You're already dead.
Who's coming with me?
Say hi to your son for me
when you get home.
What about you?
I know it's crazy,
but I can't go.
I really can't.
A year ago,
I would have been first in line.
But now...
I'll keep him company.
Good luck.
I think you're going to lose
your bet with the Captain.
Shit. Where are we?
No idea.
I'll ask someone.
Where's Pitomnik?
Bread!
Bread!
To the west.
Through the big balka.
Airport at 5 kilometers.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Look. He was wounded.
You can still read
the doctor's signature.
"Doctor Heider".
It'll work for us.
It's a free pass home!
Look for more like this one.
And put on some bandages.
We're wounded.
For you, Hans.
Relax.
You're not the only one suffering.
Powder burns.
- He did it to himself.
- No I didn't.
- Take this traitor away.
- No, Doctor, no!
We won't make it. They'll catch us.
I'm leaving.
It's too late.
- Don't fuck up.
- You neither.
At least I'm not the only one
from my unit.
They should get us out of here.
They need us on the other side.
I have witnesses, Doctor!
What's wrong, son? Fever?
I can barely make out this
signature. Who was your doctor?
Don't you remember his name?
Doctor Heider.
Excuse him, Doctor.
He's had a shock. Anti-tank battle.
- His best friend lost his legs.
- Here you go, son.
For your fever.
You'll be home soon.
Keep an eye on him for me.
Yes, sir, Doctor.
Let's go!
Where's the Lieutenant?
Hans, this way!
Be reasonable.
The plane has to unload.
Over here!
Pigs! Let me get on!
You filthy pig!
Look at the heros.
Fuckers.
- Where are you?
- Hold on.
You could have made it.
The last German plane left
Stalingrad on January 23rd, 1943.
Comrade!
Kill me!
Welcome to the tomb.
Careful! Not so hard.
Are you hurt?
You know how fragile he is.
Louse bites.
He's covered with boils.
He caught the worst of it.
No seats left on the plane?
No.
Hey Musk, you old muskrat,
guess who saved your life?
He'll never forgive me.
Leave the Captain alone.
My foot.
My God damned foot.
I wouldn't do that.
I told you to leave it alone.
Shit. Don't fucking puke on him too.
Give me a cigarette, damn it.
I said give me a fucking cigarette!
I just don't have any luck
with my right side.
It's nice we can spend a little time
dying together.
Play something for us.
Damn medals.
Stand up for Christ's sake!
Come on, stand up!
And stand straight!
I want a report, Lieutenant.
Where is your unit?
We... we have no idea.
Plunderers in the German Army
are shot.
Or have you forgotten
how we do that?
Don't move!
Müller, Müller...
I can't believe it!
They can't do this.
Don't die, Müller.
We're going home, Müller.
Lieutenant, arrest that man.
And get me out of here.
You want a report, Captain?
The Russian boy's name was Kolya.
And this boy's name was Müller.
Like a lot of boys before him.
This can still be fixed.
I know you're hungry.
I can get you supplies.
In the white house,
next to the theater.
I'll take you there.
Germans don't shoot Germans.
I'm an officer.
You can't leave me here!
I can't believe it.
Sons of bitches.
Slow down, or you'll get cramps.
We'll do it by order of rank.
You first.
Take some, Müller.
Rest in peace,
Rollo.
And Otto.
And Fritz.
To our great offensive.
Who's playing?
Hey, Fritz!
Hearts are winners.
There's a little bit of blood
on the back
of the ten of spades,
so you know.
Damn...
right side.
One of us gets serviced
while the other three play cards.
I'm not pretty enough for you?
I want to do it before I die,
- and you're all that's available.
- Do me a favor.
- Kill me. Or are you scared?
- Enough!
I'll bet you have some innocent
girlfriend back home.
You love her? Yeah?
The love of a German soldier
grows with distance.
But you'll never see her again.
You poor fool, you've probably
never even slept with her.
Maybe you should have a taste
of Slavic meat after all.
Take a look.
Just as soft and white
as your Aryan virgin's...
Fuck me and kill me!
Shoot yourself, if that's what
you want. I'm tired of killing.
- Get out of here!
- No!
Son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch.
I couldn't do it either.
I'm a collaborator.
I filthy German whore.
That's not true.
They forced you.
I should have killed myself.
I thought that once, too.
You're slowing down the game, loser.
- Spades are winners.
- There's a blood stain on the 10.
You know us so well.
I know you perfectly.
My mother was German.
I used to love your language.
I'll never forgive myself for that.
I just had the weirdest
fucking dream.
I dreamed I had to piss,
but I couldn't.
Fucking dream.
Better than pissing, eh?
Now eat something
and try again.
I'll teach her to be nice to you.
Don't touch her!
I mean it! Nobody goes back there.
Stand up, all of you!
- Rohleder, come here.
- Yes, Captain.
- Don't do it, Rollo.
- Lf he doesn't, I'll shoot you.
Stay here.
You wouldn't turn on your captain,
would you?
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.
I won't report you.
You were good soldiers
until you chose survival
at any cost.
Shut up.
Don't move, Reiser.
Do you think you'll be able
to live with yourselves
as deserters?
Shut your mouth.
Don't kid yourself.
You should know better than anyone
that you'll always be soldiers, no
matter what. The war is your home.
You're already dead.
I've prayed for death
for two years.
My flesh falls from my bones,
in pieces.
But you know what?
I put myself back together again,
night after night.
And you can't kill me.
Nobody can!
You were an officer.
Don't laugh!
Where's the front?
I want a report.
That's an order!
Heil Hitler.
Let's get out of here!
Wait, Captain.
I'll help you.
Fresh air!
He was right.
You're all fucking crazy.
Let's rest, Captain.
Then we'll continue.
Don't fall asleep,
we're going to move on.
Where's the front?
What's happening?
We've met, General. Sergeant
Rohleder, Iron Cross 1st Class.
Give me your weapon.
Go on, give it to me.
I'm a deserter, sir.
Don't talk nonsense, man.
Stand up.
- Where's the front?
- Come with us.
Gentlemen...
Where's the front?
We're almost there.
Don't fall asleep.
I'm not going to die.
You know, Hans.
At home
when you die in combat,
at least they're proud.
That's something, right?
Siberia? I won't go.
I'm cold enough as it is.
I'll get you out of here.
I'm going with her.
We won't get 100 meters,
but who cares?
This way.
Come on. It's already dark.
We'll make it.
The best thing about the cold
is that you don't feel anything.
Everything freezes.
It's too cold to cry.
Get out of here, Fritz.
I mean it. Go!
The best thing about the cold
is you don't need sunscreen.
Have you ever been in the desert?
You'd hate it.
It's so fucking hot
that you're never dry.
You feel like you're melting,
like a stick of butter.
The desert is shit.
Except for the stars...
They're so close.
You know?
More than a million people died
in the battle of Stalingrad,
in combat, or of starvation,
or froze to death.
Russians, Romanians, Italians,
Hungarians, Germans.
Of 260,000 German soldiers,
91,000 were taken prisoner.
Only 6,000 returned
to their country years later.
