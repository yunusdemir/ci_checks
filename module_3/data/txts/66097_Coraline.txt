Hello?
Who's there?
(CAT SCREECHES)
(GASPS)
(PANTlNG)
(GASPS)
(MEOWS)
(SCREAMS)
You scared me to death, you mangy thing.
I'm just looking for an old well. Know it?
Not talking, huh?
Magic dowser, magic dowser,
(THUNDER RUMBLlNG)
show me the well!
(HONKlNG)
(GASPS)
(SCREAMlNG)
Get away from me!
(CORALlNE GRUNTS)
Ooh.
Let me guess. You're from Texas or Utah,
someplace dried-out and barren, right?
I heard about water witching before,
but it doesn't make sense.
-I mean, it's just an ordinary branch.
-It's a dowsing rod.
Ow!
And I don't like being stalked,
not by psycho nerds or their cats!
He's not really my cat. He's kind of feral.
You know, wild.
Of course, I do feed him every night,
and sometimes he'll come to my window
and bring me little dead things.
Look, I'm from Pontiac.
Huh?
Michigan. And if I'm a water witch,
then where's the secret well?
You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it.
Oh!
See?
(HOLLOW THUDDlNG)
It's supposed to be so deep,
if you fell to the bottom and looked up,
you'd see a sky full of stars
in the middle of the day.
Ha!
Surprised she let you move in.
My gramma, she owns the Pink Palace.
Won't rent to people with kids.
What do you mean?
(STAMMERlNG) I'm not supposed to
talk about it. I'm Wybie. Wybie Lovat.
-Wybie?
-Short for Wyborne.
Not my idea, of course.
What'd you get saddled with?
I wasn't saddled with anything. It's Coraline.
-Caroline what?
-Coraline. Coraline Jones.
(SCOFFS) It's not real scientific,
but I heard an ordinary name like Caroline
can lead people to have
ordinary expectations about a person.
(GRUNTS lN EXASPERATlON)
LOVAT: Wyborne!
I think I heard
someone calling you, Wyborne.
-What? I didn't hear anything.
-I definitely heard someone,
Why-Were-You-Born.
-LOVAT: Wyborne!
-Grandma!
(CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY)
Well, great to meet a Michigan water witch,
but I'd wear gloves next time.
-Why?
-'Cause that dowsing rod of yours,
it's poison oak.
(EXCLAlMS)
(BLOWlNG RASPBERRY)
(SPLASHlNG)
I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.
Uh-huh.
I would've died.
That's nice.
Hmm.
So, can I go out?
I think it's perfect weather for gardening.
No, Coraline. Rain makes mud.
Mud makes a mess.
But, Mom, I want stuff growing
when my friends come to visit.
Isn't that why we moved here?
Something like that.
But then we had the accident.
-lt wasn't my fault you hit that truck.
-I never said it was.
I can't believe it.
You and Dad get paid to write about plants,
and you hate dirt.
Coraline, I don't have time for you
right now,
and you still have unpacking to do.
Lots of unpacking.
(SARCASTlCALLY) That sounds exciting!
Oh. Some kid left this on the front porch.
WYBIE: Hey, Jonesy.
Look what I found in Gramma's trunk.
Look familiar? Wybie.
(GROANS)
CORALlNE: Huh.
A little me? That's weird.
What's his name, anyway?
Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.
Hey, Dad. How's the writing going?
Dad!
Hello, Coraline and Coraline doll.
Do you know where the garden tools are?
It's... It's pouring out there, isn't it?
(SCOFFS)
-It's just raining.
-What'd the boss say?
"Don't even think about going out,
Coraline Jones!"
Then you won't need the tools.
(GROANS)
(SQUEAKS)
(SQUEAKlNG)
(GROANS)
You know, this house is 150 years old.
-So?
-So explore it.
Go out and count all the doors and windows
and write that down on...
List everything that's blue. Just let me work.
(TYPlNG)
(SlGHS)
Ew!
(EXCLAlMS)
(SQUEAKS)
(SCREAMlNG)
No. No, no, no. No.
(SCREAMlNG)
One boring blue boy
in a painfully boring painting.
Four incredibly boring windows
and no more doors.
All right, little me. Where are you hiding?
Huh?
Hey, Mom. Where does this door go?
I'm really, really busy.
CORALlNE: I think it's locked.
Please!
(GROANS)
Will you stop pestering me
if I do this for you?
(WHlMPERlNG)
Fine.
(CREAKlNG)
Bricks? I don't get it.
(SlGHS)
They must've closed this off
when they divided up the house.
You're kidding.
And why is the door so small?
We made a deal! Zip it!
You didn't lock it.
(MOM EXCLAlMlNG lN FRUSTRATlON)
(SlNGlNG) Oh, my twitchy-witchy girl
I think you are so nice
I give you bowls of porridge
And I give you bowls of ice cream
(GROANS lN DlSGUST)
Why don't you ever cook, Mom?
Coraline, we've been through this before.
Your dad cooks, I clean,
and you stay out of the way.
I swear I'll go food shopping
soon as we finish the catalog.
Try some of the chard.
You need a vegetable.
It looks more like slime to me.
Well, it's slime or bedtime, fusspot.
Now what's it gonna be?
Think they're trying to poison me?
(SlGHS)
(SlGHS)
Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?
Good night, little me.
(MOUSE SQUEAKlNG)

(CORALlNE GASPS)
Whoa!
Huh?
(SNlFFlNG)
Mmm. Something smells good.
(OTHER MOTHER HUMMlNG)
Mom? What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?
You're just in time for supper, dear.
You're not my mother.
My mother doesn't have...
(STAMMERS)
(MlMlCS STAMMERlNG)
(CHUCKLES) Buttons? Do you like them?
I'm your other mother, silly.
Now go tell your other father
that supper's ready.
Well, go on. He's in his study.
(PlANO PLAYlNG)
CORALlNE: Hello?
Hello, Coraline.
Wanna hear my new song?
-My father can't play piano.
-No need to.
This piano plays me.
(EXCLAlMS lN SURPRlSE)
(PLAYlNG MERRY TUNE)
(SlNGlNG) Making up a song about Coraline
She's a peach, she's a doll
She's a pal of mine
She's as cute as a button
in the eyes of everyone
Who ever laid their eyes on Coraline
When she comes around exploring
Mom and I will never, ever make it boring
Our eyes will be on Coraline
I'm sorry,
but she said to tell you the food's ready.
Mmm.
Who's starving? Raise your hand.
Whoa!
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
(OTHER FATHER CLEARS THROAT)
We give our thanks and ask to bless
our mother's golden chicken breast.
(OTHER FATHER LAUGHlNG)
(TlNKLlNG)
(SNlFFlNG)
Mmm!
-CORALlNE: This chicken is good.
-Hungry, aren't you?
-Do you have any gravy?
-Well, here comes the gravy train.
Choo, choo!
Huh.
Another roll? Sweet peas? Corn on the cob?
I'm real thirsty.
Of course. Any requests?
Mango milkshake?
-Home?
-We've been waiting for you, Coraline.
-For me?
-OTHER FATHER: Yep.
Wasn't the same here without you, kiddo.
I didn't know I had another mother.
Of course you do. Everyone does.
-Really?
-OTHER MOTHER: Uh-huh.
And soon as you're through eating,
I thought we'd play a game.
You mean like hide-and-seek?
Perfect. Hide-and-seek in the rain.
What rain?
(EXCLAlMS lN SURPRlSE)
-What about the mud?
-We love mud here.
Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies.
-It's great for poison oak.
-How'd you know l...
I... I'd love to play,
but I better get home to my other mother.
But I'm your other mother.
I mean my other, other mother.
Mom number one?
(OTHER FATHER EXCLAlMS)
I think I should get to bed.
Of course, sweetheart. It's all made up.
-But...
-Come along, sleepyhead.
(CORALlNE GASPS)
-Wow.
-DRAGONFLY: Hello, Coraline.
DRAGONFLlES: Hello, hello, hello, hello.
-What's shaking, baby?
-Hello.
GIRL: Hey. How's it going, Loper?
Where's your swampers and chook?
Cripes almighty! How are my best trolls?
I can't wait till summer.
You're both coming, right?
-We're already here, Coraline.
-Gone to Oregon.
CORALlNE: Oh.
The mud.
(YAWNS)
-See you soon.
-See you soon.
(YAWNS)
(GASPS)
It's gone. My poison oak! It's gone!
Huh.
(KETTLE WHlSTLlNG)
It was incredibly real, Mom.
Only you weren't really you.
You were my other mother.
Buttons for eyes, huh?
Coraline, you only dreamed
you ate all that chicken.
Take your multivitamin at least.
You were in the dream, too, Dad.
You had wild-looking pajamas
and orange monkey slippers.
(LAUGHS) Orange?
My monkey slippers are blue.
Psst! Can you get me some of that
magic mud you were talking about?
Because I have a terrible case
of writer's rash on my...
(MOM CLEARS THROAT)
If the real Charlie Jones
wants his pages edited,
he better wrap them up ASAP.
Coraline,
why don't you go visit downstairs?
I bet those actresses
would love to hear your dream.
Miss Spink and Forcible?
But you said they're dingbats.
Mmm-hmm.
Bobinsky. Bobinsky. Bobinsky.
(SNlFFS)
(GROANS)
(EXCLAlMS lN DlSGUST)
Hello?
I think our mail got mixed up.
Should I leave it outside, or...
(EXCLAlMS)
(CLUCKlNG)
CORALlNE: Hmm.
Secret!
(GASPS)
Famous jumping mouse circus not ready,
Iittle girl.
Circus?
Oh, uh...
I brought this for you.
(SNlFFlNG)
(SlGHS CONTENTEDLY)
(SPEAKlNG RUSSlAN)
Huh?
New cheese samples.
(BOBlNSKY GRUNTS)
Very clever using this mix-up
to sneak my home and peek at mooshkas?
-Mooshkas?
-The mice!
Oh!
Sorry. I'm Coraline Jones.
And I am the Amazing Bobinsky.
But you call me Mr. B
because amazing I already know that I am.
(GRUNTS)
(GASPS)
Ha!
You see, Caroline, the problem is...
My new songs go oompah, oompah,
but the jumping mice play only toodle-toot,
like that.
Is nice but not so much amazing.
So now, I switch to stronger cheese
and soon, watch out!
Here, have beet. Make you strong.
Do svidaniya, Caroline.
Coraline.
Oompah, oompah. Toodle-toot. Toodle-toot.
Hey, Caroline!
(SPEAKlNG RUSSlAN)
Wait!
No!
(BOBlNSKY GRUNTS)
The mice asked me to give you message.
The jumping mice?
They are saying
do not go through little door.
(GASPS)
Do you know such a thing?
The one behind the wallpaper?
But it's all bricked up.
Bah. So sorry. Is nothing.
Sometimes the mice are little mixed-up.
(GRUNTS)
They even get your name wrong, you know?
They call you Coraline instead of Caroline.
Not Caroline at all.
Maybe I work them too hard.
(DOGS BARKlNG)
Cease your infernal yapping.
How nice to see you, Caroline.
Would you like to come in?
We're playing cards.
Still Coraline, Miss Spink.
Miriam! Put the kettle on!
April, I think you're being followed.
It's the new neighbor, Miriam. Caroline.
She'll be having the oolong tea.
No! Oh, no, no.
I'm sure she'd prefer jasmine.
No, oolong.
Ah. Jasmine it is, then.
(SlGHS)
Come on, boys.
Are those dogs real?
Our sweet departed angels.
Couldn't bear to part with them,
so we had them stuffed.
Now, there's Hamish the third...
Go on. Have one.
It's hand-pulled taffy from Brighton.
Best in the world.
SPlNK:...the third, the ninth, yes.
The fourth, I'm right.
And Jock Jr., Jock Sr.,
Jock the third, the fourth,
and that's Jock's second cousin
thrice removed.
I'll read them if you like.
-Read what?
-Your tea leaves, dear.
They'll tell me your future.
Drink up then. Go on.
No, not all of it. Not all of it.
That's right. Now hand it over.
Oh!
Oh, Caroline.
Caroline, Caroline, Caroline.
You are in terrible danger.
Oh, give me that cup, April.
Your eyes are going.
My eyes? You're blind as a bat.
Well, not to worry, child.
It's good news. There's a tall,
handsome beast in your future.
-A what?
-Miriam, really.
You're holding it wrong. See? Danger.
CORALlNE: What do you see?
SPlNK: I see a very peculiar hand.
FORClBLE: I see a giraffe.
Giraffes don't just fall from the sky, Miriam.
Oh, Lord.
(DOG YlPS)
Well, what should I do?
Never wear green in your dressing room.
Acquire a very tall stepladder.
And be very, very careful.
(GASPS)
Now, was there something
you came to tell us?
No. I guess not. Thanks for the tea, though.
FORClBLE: Toodle-oo.
SPlNK: Cheery-bye.
FORClBLE: Do you have
any nice queens for Mummy?
(DOG YlPS)
Danger?
(RATTLES)
(EXCLAlMS)
Great! The village stalker.
Ow!
I wasn't stalking you.
We're hunting banana slugs.
What do you mean "we?"
(CAT MEOWS)
Ha! Your cat's not wild. He's a wuss puss.
What? He hates to get his feet wet. Jeez.
Wuss puss.
So, that doll. Did you make it look like me?
Oh, no. I found it that way.
It's older than Grandma.
Old as this house, probably.
Come on.
Blue hair, my swampers and raincoat?
Dang! Check out Slugzilla.
You're just like them.
Huh?
I meant my parents.
They don't listen to me either.
Uh-huh. You mind?
(MlMlCS CHOMPlNG)
(GRUNTS)
(SCREAMS)
Hmm.
Ew!
You know, I've never been inside
the Pink Palace.
You're kidding.
Grandma'd kill me.
Thinks it's dangerous or something.
Dangerous?
-Well, she had a twin sister.
-So?
When they were kids,
Grandma's sister disappeared.
She says she was stolen.
CORALlNE: Stolen?
(MEOWS)
Well, what do you think?
I don't know. Maybe she just ran away.
LOVAT: Wyborne!
-Look, I gotta go.
-Wait a minute.
(SQUEAKlNG)
(SQUEAKS)
(OTHER MOTHER HUMMlNG)
-Welcome back, darling.
-Hi.
So thoughtful of you
to send this nice cheddar, Coraline.
Cheddar? Oh! The mice bait.
Would you go fetch your father?
I bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now.
You mean my other father.
Your better father, dear.
He's out in the garden.
But my parents don't have time to garden.
(SHUSHlNG)
Mmm!
Go on.
(CORALlNE GASPS)
Oh!
(LAUGHS)
Hey.
I love your garden!
Our garden, Coraline.
(SQUEALlNG)
Stop tickling me!
Daughter in distress.
(TRUMPETlNG)
(LAUGHlNG)
Tickle no more, you dragon snappers.
Well, she says it's time for dinner,
breakfast, food.
Hop on, kiddo.
I wanna show you something.
CORALlNE: I can't believe you did this.
OTHER FATHER: Mother said you'd like it.
Boy, she knows you
like the back of her hand.
Mmm. So good.
I love dinner-breakfast-food.
Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you
to come see the jumping mice perform
after dinner.
Really? That know-it-all Wybie
said it was all in Mr. B's head.
I knew he was wrong.
Well, everything's right in this world, kiddo.
Your father and I will clean up
while you and your friend head upstairs.
My friend?
Great. Another Wybie.
Hello, Why-Were-You-Born.
Hello!
I thought you'd like him more
if he spoke a little less. So I fixed him.
-So he can't talk at all?
-Nope.
Hmm.
I like it.
Now, run along, you two, and have fun.
You're awful cheerful
considering you can't say anything.
It didn't hurt, did it, when she...
(LAUGHS)
CORALlNE: Whoa!
(CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Cool!
(LAUGHlNG)
(CLUCKlNG)
(CANNONS BOOMlNG)
CORALlNE: Look at you!
(CORALlNE LAUGHS)
OTHER BOBlNSKY: Lady and gentleman,
for to tickle your eyes and ears
and making hearts to thump,
I, Sergei Alexander Bobinsky,
am introducing my astoundishing,
stupendulous and amazing
jumping mouse circus!
(SQUEAKlNG)
My name!
(FANFARE PLAYlNG)
(ClRCUS MUSlC PLAYlNG)
It's wonderful, Wybie.
(DRUM ROLL)
Wow!
(MUSlC CONTlNUES)
Yahoo! That was great!
Very, very thank you, lady and gentleman.
We loved it, Mr. B. It was so... So...
Ah...
Amazing!
You are very welcome anytime you like.
You and also your good friend there.
Do svidaniya, Coraline.
(KlSSES)
(GROANS)
(GRUNTS)
CORALlNE: There were garden squash
like balloon animals and snapdragons.
Oh, and upstairs, I saw a real mouse circus.
Not pretend like the crazy man's
in our house.
You sure you won't come?
Don't fret, Charlie.
They'll love the new catalog.
At least they'll love my chapters.
I did not call him crazy, Coraline.
He's drunk.
Well, I guess I'll see you around,
you dizzy dreamer.
Dad! I'm not five anymore.
(GEARS CRANKlNG)
(STRUMMlNG)
(EXCLAlMS lN SURPRlSE)
My kingdom for a horse!
(CRASHlNG)
Put them back.
But, Mom, the whole school's gonna wear
boring gray clothes. No one will have these.
Put them back.
My other mother would get them.
Maybe she should buy all your clothes.
CORALlNE: So what do you think
is in the other apartment?
I don't know.
Not a family of Jones imposters.
-Then why'd you lock the door?
-Oh!
I found some rat crap,
and I thought you'd feel safer.
They're jumping mice, Mom,
and the dreams aren't dangerous.
They're the most fun I've had
since we've moved here.
-Your school might be fun.
-With those stupid uniforms? Right.
Had to give it a try.
How do you feel about a mustard,
ketchup, salsa wrap for lunch?
Are you kidding me?
Had to go food shopping, anyway.
Dad's planning something special.
Grossgusting.
You wanna come along?
You can pick out something you like.
Oh. Like the gloves.
(MOM SlGHS)
Look, Coraline, if things go well today,
I promise I'll make it up.
That's what you always say.
Won't be long.
But I might be.
I knew it was real.
(PURRS)
OTHER MOTHER: Dearest Coraline,
Miss Spink and Miss Forcible
have invited you downstairs after lunch.
I hope you like the new outfit I made you.
Love, Mother.
(BURPS)
(CAT MEOWS)
Wybie's got a cat like you at home.
(MEOWS)
Not the quiet Wybie.
The one that talks too much.
You must be the other cat.
No, I'm not the other anything. I'm me.
Um... I can see you don't have button eyes,
but if you're the same cat,
how can you talk?
I just can.
Cats don't talk at home.
-No?
-Nope.
Well, you're clearly
the expert on these things.
After all, I'm just a big fat wuss puss.
Come back. Please?
I'm sorry I called you that. I really am.
How'd you get here?
I've been coming here for a while.
It's a game we play.
She hates cats and tries to keep me out,
but she can't, of course.
I come and go as I please.
The other mother hates cats?
Not like any mother I've ever known.
What do you mean? She's amazing.
You probably think this world
is a dream come true, but you're wrong.
The other Wybie told me so.
That's nonsense. He can't talk.
Perhaps not to you.
We cats, however,
have far superior senses than humans,
and can see and smell and...
Shh!
I hear something. Right over...
(MEOWS)
(SNlFFlNG)
(ORCHESTRA TUNlNG)
Hey, Wybie.
(MUSlC PLAYlNG)
She's practically naked!
(SlNGlNG) I'm known as the siren
of all seven seas
The breaker of hearts by the bay
So if you go swimming
With bowlegged women
I might steal your weak heart away
(DOGS BARKlNG)
Oh, my God.
(SlNGlNG) A big-bottomed sea witch
May bob through the waves
And hope to lead sailors astray
But a true ocean goddess
Must fill out her bodice
To present an alluring display
(DOGS BARKlNG)
Oh! Beware of old oysters
too large in the chest
Let's banish them from the buffet
I'm far more nutritious
You smell like the fishes
Did I hear a banshee?
You're sea green with envy
This mermaid enchantress
No, I, Birth of Venus
-Will send sailors swooning...
-Will send sailors swooning all day
(SCREAMS lN PAlN)

Hey, there.
Was it wonderful, dear?
Oh, yeah. They swooped down
and pulled me right out of my seat,
Spink and Forcible,
only they weren't old ladies.
That was just a disguise. But then,
I was flying through the air, and it was...
It was magic.
You do like it here, don't you, Coraline?
Uh-huh.
Good night, Wybie.
You could stay here forever if you want to.
-Really?
-Sure.
We'll sing and play games,
and Mother will cook your favorite meals.
There's one tiny little thing we need to do.
-What's that?
-(CHUCKLlNG) Well, it's a surprise.
For you, our little doll.
Black is traditional.
But if you'd prefer pink
or vermillion or chartreuse...
(GASPS)
Though you might make me jealous.
No way!
You're not sewing buttons in my eyes!
But we need a "yes"
if you want to stay here.
So sharp you won't feel a...
Ow!
There, now. It's your decision, darling.
We only want what's best for you.
I'm going to bed. Right now!
-Bed?
-Before dinner?
I'm really, really tired. Yeah.
(YAWNlNG)
I just need to sleep on things.
Well, of course you do, darling.
I'll be happy to tuck you in.
Oh, no, thanks.
You've done so much already.
You're welcome. And l...
We aren't worried at all, darling.
Soon you'll see things our way.
DRAGONFLlES: What's wrong, Coraline?
Don't you wanna play?
Yeah! I wanna hug your face!
GlRAFFE DOLL: Get a grip, soldier!
GIRL: Hey!
BOY: Hey!
Where's your buttons, Loper?
You want to stay, don't you?
Going home tonight, robots,
and I won't be back.
(GRUNTlNG)
Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.
(ECHOING) Go to sleep. Go to sleep.
OTHER MOTHER:
...a tiny little thing we need to do.
CORALINE: Go to sleep.
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.
OTHER FATHER:
So sharp you won't feel a thing.
CORALINE: Go to sleep. Go to sleep.
OTHER MOTHER:
Soon you'll see things our way.
Mom! Dad!
(GASPS)
Oh, God. I'm still here?
(PlANO PLAYlNG)
Hey, you!
Where's the other mother?
I wanna go home.
All will be swell,
soon as Mother's refreshed.
Her strength is our strength.
Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.
If you won't even talk to me,
I'm gonna find the other Wybie.
-He'll help me.
-No point.
He pulled a long face,
and Mother didn't like it.
(GRUNTS)
(GASPS)
(CAT MEOWS)
And what do you think you're doing?
Well, I'm getting out of here.
That's what I'm doing.
Huh?
Something's wrong.
Shouldn't the old well be here?
Nothing out here.
It's the empty part of this world.
She only made
what she knew would impress you.
But why? Why does she want me?
She wants something to love, I think.
Something that isn't her.
Or maybe she'd just love something to eat.
Eat? That's ridiculous.
Mothers don't eat daughters.
I don't know. How do you taste?
(LAUGHlNG)
CORALlNE: Huh?
But how can you walk away from something
and still come back to it?
Walk around the world.
Small world.
(FANFARE PLAYlNG)
Hang on.

I want to be with my real mom and dad.
I want you to let me go.
Is that any way to talk to your mother?
You aren't my mother.
Apologize at once, Coraline!
No!
I'll give you to the count of three.
One.
Two.

Ow!
What are you doing? Ow! That hurts!
You may come out when you've learned

Who's there?
TALL GlRL GHOST: Hush! And shush.
For the beldam might be listening.
You... You mean the other mother?
Who are you?
Don't remember our names,
but I 'member my true mommy.
Why are you all here?
GHOST CHlLDREN: The beldam.
She spied on our lives
through the little doll's eyes.
BOY GHOST: And saw that we weren't happy.
TALL GlRL GHOST:
So she lured us away with treasures.
-And treats.
-SWEET GlRL GHOST: And games to play.
BOY GHOST: Gave all that we asked.
SWEET GlRL GHOST:
Yet we still wanted more.
TALL GlRL GHOST:
So we let her sew the buttons.
BOY GHOST: She said that she loved us.
TALL GlRL GHOST: But she locked us here.
GHOST CHlLDREN: And ate up our lives.
Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever.
Not if she wants to win my life.
Beating her is my only chance.
Perhaps, if you do win your escape,
you could find our eyes.
Has she taken those, too?
Yes, miss. And hidden them.
BOY GHOST: Find our eyes, mistress,
and our souls will be freed.
I...
I'll try.

Um...
My grandma's real mad.
Says it was her sister's.
-The one that disappeared.
-You stole that doll, didn't you?
Well, it looked just like you, and I figured...
It used to look like this pioneer girl,
then Huck Finn Jr.,
then it was this Little Rascals chick
with all these ribbons and braids and...
Grandma's missing sister.
I think I just met her. Come on.
(STAMMERlNG) Listen,
I'm really not supposed to...
Whoa!
She's in there.
Can you... Can you unlock it?
Not in a million years.
But it wouldn't matter.
She can't escape without her eyes.
None of the ghosts can.
(EXCLAlMS lN DlSBELlEF)
Yeah. So I really need to get that doll.
Great! I'd love to get rid of it.
Where are you hiding, you little monster?
-You and Grandma been talking?
-The doll's her spy.
It's how she watches you,
finds out what's wrong with your life.
-The doll is my grandma's spy?
-No. The other mother.
She's got this whole world
where everything's better.
The food, the garden, the neighbors.
But it's all a trap.
(GULPS)
Yeah, I think I heard
someone calling me, Jonesy.
Don't believe me? You can ask the cat.
The cat? I'll just tell Grandma

We've waited months for those tickets.
I suppose we could walk.

It's nearly two miles to the theater.

Where are my parents?
Gosh, I have no idea
where your old parents are.
Perhaps they've grown bored of you

They weren't bored of me. You stole them!
Now, don't be difficult, Coraline.
Have a seat, won't you?

Why don't we play a game?

Uh-huh.
OTHER MOTHER:
What kind of game would it be?
An exploring game. A finding things game.
And what is it you'd be finding, Coraline?
My real parents.
Too easy.
And the eyes of the ghost children.
Huh.
What if you don't find them?
If I lose, I'll stay here with you forever
and let you love me.
(CORALlNE SlGHS)
And I'll let you sew buttons into my eyes.
Hmm.
And if you somehow win this game?
Then you let me go. You let everyone go.
My real father and mother,
the dead children,
everyone you've trapped here.
(EXCLAlMS)
Deal.
Not till you give me a clue.
Oh, right.
In each of three wonders
I've made just for you,
a ghost's eye is lost in plain sight.
And for my parents?

Fine. Don't tell me.

Is this what you're looking for?
Uh-huh.
You think winning game is good thing?
You'll just go home and be bored

We will listen to you and laugh with you.
If you stay here,
you can have whatever you want.
Always!
You don't get it, do you?

Of course you don't understand.

No, I suppose not.
After all, you still need to find

Too bad you won't have this.

Be clever, miss.
Even if you win, she'll never let you go!
