THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESlRE
I'd like a 1 st-class sleeper
on the Seville-Paris tonight
and a couchette.
I have nothing for tonight.
There are no sleepers
on the Seville-Paris.
But I can give you two seats
as far as Madrid tomorrow night,
then a sleeper
and a couchette to Paris.
All right. I have a trunk
and three suitcases.
Can you have them picked up
and forwarded to Paris?
No problem. I'll take care of it.
First-class, you said.
- Where is she?
- Gone, sir.
- When?
- Barely 5 minutes ago.
Come with me.
- She was bleeding.
- lt's nothing. Just her nose.
Burn it.
- She left barefoot.
- Get rid of all that.
Very good.
- A pair of panties, sir.
- Burn it.
It's all wet.
She must have been afraid.
We return to Paris tomorrow.
See to the packing.
Gladly, sir. I was tired
of steaks cooked in oil.
I used to work in a restaurant.
One regular, an elderly German,
always used to quote
one of their philosophers:
"lf you go with women,
carry a big stick."
That's not funny.
To the bank.
Damn it! Here, as well.
Another terrorist attack.
Quick, turn around.
We'll be late.
This is your car.
I'll see you in Madrid.
Excuse me, sir.
Are you going to Paris?
We must live in the same area.
I've passed you in the street.
I live on Rue Rembrandt.
- Me, Rue Murillo.
- lndeed.
It's a long trip.
But I simply cannot get used
to flying.
These days, if you take
a plane to Brussels,
thanks to two very nice young
people, you wind up in the desert.
Excuse me, I'm afraid
you're in my seat.
- I'm so sorry...
- Please, stay where you are.
- You don't mind?
- Not at all.
I need to sit facing forward
or I get nauseous.
- Going home to Paris?
- With my daughter.
- You, too?
- Yes.
Didn't we meet at the Law Courts,
in my cousin's office?
Quite possible. I'm a judge.
- Your cousin's name?
- Edouard Foucade.
I know him well.
An outstanding mind.
- I'm Vincent d'Olargues.
- Mathieu Fabert.
Delighted.
He's often spoken of you.
No, thank you. There's no need.
Are you French, too?
Yes. I live in Paris.
Weren't you at the bullfights
Sunday?
Yes. There's no mistaking me
for anyone else.
- Care to see the newspaper?
- No, thank you. I've read it.
Already three minutes late.
That often happens.
You can't leave like this!
You don't understand. Don't go.
You can't do this.
Care for something to read?
Going straight on to Paris?
No, I'll spend three
or four days in Madrid.
Mister, why did you throw
water on the lady?
Hush, lsabelle.
It's impolite to ask questions.
No, madam, she's right to ask.
After all, it's not a very
common act.
Isn't that so, Mr. d'Olargues?
Well, I must say...
No, indeed, it's not very common.
Even if there's no law against it.
But I think...
Let me just assure you,
I'm not a lunatic.
You have absolutely nothing
to fear.
I don't mean to be indiscreet,
but I'd give something to know
why you did what you did.
You're quite curious, sir.
I'm a psychology professor.
Do you teach at the Sorbonne?
No, I give private lessons.
I understand.
Mr. Fabert...
You seem like a normal person.
Your cousin Edouard is a friend.
So I think your act has an
explanation, even if it is unusual.
Isn't it better to drench
than to kill someone?
Probably.
That woman was the dregs.
The worst woman on earth.
My only consolation is to think
that when she dies,
God won't forgive her.
Personally, I find your case
highly interesting.
So do l. Sincerely.
If you wish, I can try
to tell you what happened.
A terrorist group was on trial.
I forget their names.
I came to wait for my cousin,
as I often do,
at the end of the session.
Hello, how are you?
Fine.
- Coffee, sir?
- No, thank you, child.
So? Did they get the death penalty?
Hardly. The priest got 8 years
and the others 3. lt's pathetic.
I think the jury received
death threats.
- From whom?
- The R.A.B.J., obviously.
R-A-B-J. "Revolutionary Army
of the Baby Jesus."
The ones behind
the Saint Damian's bombing.
That's right.
15 people were killed.
So, are we lunching at your place?
- lt's all ready.
- Let's go, then.
So, what's cooking?
Scrambled eggs with truffles,
to start.
Superb.
- Then, chicken with lobster.
- I'm sure I'm going to love it.
May I peek? I like to see
my meals beforehand.
I'll come with you.
- You're the new chambermaid?
- Yes, sir. I began this morning.
- What's your name?
- Conchita.
You're Spanish?
You speak French well.
I've been living here for 10 years.
Excuse me.
The young lady didn't seem
Iike a very experienced servant.
I'll bet she was the girl
you drenched.
Yes, it was.
Nice work.
It was easy enough.
A child of five could have guessed.
Today's terrorists are clearly
fascinated by danger.
Some may be politically motivated,
but most are in it for the risk,
the exploit.
Just you wait, they'll be
on the sports page soon.
The other glass for red wine.
That's fine, miss. Thanks.
Excuse me, I'm still learning.
The Bonnot Gang is history.
They had an ideal, at least.
They used revolvers
to terrorize Paris for days.
They were unselfish, generous.
Sure, but they were still gangsters.
She's obviously never worked
with her hands.
Notice how delicate they are?
You rang, sir?
Tell Conchita to bring me
a glass of chartreuse.
Yellow or green?
Green. lt's more stimulating.
And slightly aphrodisiac.
- You're very cultivated, Martin.
- Thank you, sir.
No, don't go just yet. Shut the door.
Come here.
Closer.
I meant to ask you...
What did you do before?
I worked in an office,
on the switchboard.
Then in the cloakroom
in a small town bar.
- But I quit.
- Why?
The atmosphere.
I had a strict upbringing.
I'll turn down the bed.
- Which region are you from?
- Andalusia. From Seville.
I know Andalusia. I like it a lot.
- What does your father do?
- My father's dead.
Never mind that. Come here.
I don't intend to treat you
Iike a servant.
Besides, you're not a servant.
As you can see.
Please sit down.
- Your mother lives in Paris?
- Yes, in the suburbs.
At times I feel utterly lost,
you know.
I can't get used to it.
Get used to what?
To everything. To people,
to what's going on.
It's really hard for me.
- Besides, I don't like working.
- Really?
I work to help my mother,
who's always in church.
Apart from that, the only thing
I like to do is dance.
You're a dancer?
Unfortunately, it's not a living.
- How old are you?
- 18.
What do you think of me?
I hardly know you.
- Your hair is like silk.
- You think so?
I'm going to bed.
Don't go. I have something
serious to tell you.
Where's Conchita?
- She's gone, sir.
- Gone? How, gone?
Early this morning. Without her
wages, without any explanation.
- You have her address?
- No, sir.
Why not?
I found her through the want ads.
She turned up two days ago.
A pity.
What happened next?
- I'm not boring you?
- On the contrary.
About three months later,
I was in Switzerland on business,
staying at a hotel
where I go occasionally...
A light, please.
No, not a light, I want money.
But I have none.
We need money.
No, just 800 francs.
Your papers, sir.
What are you doing here?
- Returning your 800 francs.
- What?
We spotted you at the hotel.
Those young men are my friends.
We were on tour. Our manager
Ieft with the receipts.
Keep the money.
I insist. Keep it.
I'll pay you back when I can.
- Why did you walk out?
- Because of you.
What did I do?
You were too affectionate.
I felt it. I preferred to leave.
I'll be here a few more days.
Won't you stay with me?
I'd like to, but I must go home.
- So soon?
- My mother's waiting.
She has no money.
I have to go. Thanks.
Where do you live?
56B, rue Louis Blanc,
in Courbevoie.
Do two Spanish women live here?
That door, there.
Is Conchita here?
Hello. Come in.
It's the man who lent us the money.
How nice.
- Am I disturbing?
- Not at all.
On the contrary.
Let me have your coat.
We were about to have coffee.
Care for some?
With pleasure.
- Are you well, Conchita?
- Yes, just fine.
I can tell.
I'll pay you back for Conchita's
ticket as soon as I can.
The others promised they would,
too.
Unfortunately, I have no money
right now. Neither do they.
There's no hurry, madam.
- You made it home all right?
- Yes, thanks to you.
My friends are grateful and so am l.
Don't mention it. lt was
the most pleasant of holdups.
Your father?
Yes, he died six years ago.
He committed suicide.
How awful.
A good man, but he left me
nothing but debts.
I have no pension, nothing,
and I have no skills.
It's the problem
of well bred women.
She spends her days in church.
I have to pray
for my husband's poor soul.
I was offered a job as concierge,
but I've too much pride for that.
I'd rather kiss church steps
then sweep doorsteps.
My daughter helps me
but I don't want her to work.
Why not?
Because of the bad influences.
The things you hear!
If she'd heeded them,
she'd have been gone long ago.
Don't worry about the money.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
It's really of no importance.
And if you're a bit short right now...
Please accept this.
Gladly, sir.
This is a difficult time for us.
I'm happy to be of help.
I have to go out.
Thank you again.
You can stay, if you like.
Not afraid of me anymore?
Come with me.
I'm not that kind of a girl.
If that's what you're after,
then leave and don't come back.
I understand you.
Is dancing all you really know
how to do?
I don't like sewing. I can't cook.
What am I supposed to do?
Don't you get out?
It's stupid to stroll idly.
Especially if you can't shop.
I'd rather stay in bed.
Hand me that box on the mantel?
Would you like a candy?
You may not believe this,
but I was captivated.
- I went back there for a month.
- What?
- I went back nearly every day.
- What did you say?
Let's wait a moment.
It's you.
Bravo, Conchita.
You're perspiring.
We've been working
for half an hour.
I brought you some coffee
and cookies.
That's lovely.
He's a friend. El Morenito.
We've already met.
Yes, sir, in Lausanne.
See you tomorrow.
Goodnight.
We're rehearsing a number.
I'm drenched in sweat.
Excuse me.
Your mother's not in?
This is for you.
What is it?
Would you open it?
It's so beautiful.
Give it to my mother,
it'll make her happy.
I feel so good like this.
Come sit down. I'll sing you a song.
Here?
Sit here.
Did you understand?
Sit here.
It means...
"ls anyone listening? - No.
"Shall I tell you? - Tell me.
"Do you have another lover? - No.
"Shall I be your lover? - Yes."
- And it's true?
- lt's a song. The words aren't mine.
- I never stop thinking of you.
- Neither do l.
What are you doing?
What's got into you?
But, Conchita, you came
and sat in my lap.
You kissed me.
I kissed you to thank you.
And because I like you.
- You kiss me but don't love me.
- Me?
I know what you're after.
I amuse you, you like me.
But that's all.
Do as you like with other girls.
I can give you some names,
if you want. But I'm me.
- What I want is quite different.
- Tell me what.
The first time we met,
do you remember?
I was struck by your eyes.
I found them kind.
I'm sure I wasn't wrong.
Every day, I ask myself:
What can I do for her?
And all I can think of...
is this.
Hello. Been here long?
Less than five minutes.
Hello, madam.
Don't get up.
What's this?
More coffee and cakes!
You're really spoiling us.
I'll go prepare all this.
Oh, sir, two women alone
are so vulnerable.
We'd be rich now, had we got off
on the wrong track.
But once thing is sure:
Sin has never spent the night here.
Our souls are straighter
than St John's finger.
Sometimes I'm glad
Conchita doesn't work.
Why is that?
The language you hear
in the street!
Young girls are led astray
more by the advice of women
than of men.
I know girls with a rosary
in their hand
and the devil under their skirts.
Come over here.
Do you have a lover?
- ls that true?
- Of course.
Why are you like that?
Afraid to commit a sin?
No, that doesn't bother me.
Are you frigid?
There's so much I can't ask you.
But if there's a reason, tell me.
- I was sure you wouldn't guess.
- What is it, then?
I'm mozita.
Mozita?
What does that mean?
I've never been with a man.
Excuse me.
Mr. Fabert would like to see you.
- I'll meet you back at the house.
- All right.
He asked me to bring you
to his home.
Very well.
- Sir, that lady is here.
- Show her in.
Please sit down.
I think you know me well enough
by now.
And I'm sure of one thing, madam:
I love your daughter. Very much.
I wish to unite my life with hers.
You understand?
You want to marry her?
I can't, for the moment.
Later, perhaps.
But here's what I propose...
Take a look.
I propose to have her live here
with me.
I'll do everything I can for her.
Understand?
No more rambling
around the house.
Naturally, I'll look after you, too.
Never again will either of you
have to work.
Take this in the meantime.
But I count on you for one thing.
I'd like you to help me.
I want you to bring her here.
- Can you do that?
- I think so.
The day after tomorrow,
around 5 p.m. Come with her.
And reassure her.
Tell her I'm sincere.
Fine.
I'm counting on you.
Whose is that?
- lt's my TV set, sir.
- What's it for?
To lend to the young lady.
They say it deadens the mind,
but if you're alone....
- Take it away.
- Very well, sir.
Wait. lt's her.
You again. Come in.
What is it?
A letter for you.
"l wanted to give myself to you.
"You tried to buy me
from my mother.
"You'll never see me again."
Stop the decorating.
There's no point now.
- I'm not surprised, sir.
- How's that?
Never wait for a woman
at the first rendezvous.
- Why not?
- Because she won't show up.
Concierge!
- They left?
- Yes, this morning.
- Were they alone?
- I think so.
They didn't leave anything for me?
Not with me.
Will they be back?
It would surprise me.
Won't they have to come back
for the furniture?
No, it's a furnished place.
They took their belongings.
Who knows where?
What are you going to do now?
Answer me.
Nothing. I don't want a thing.
Pull yourself together. Do some
traveling. This is unlike you.
These have been a disastrous
two months.
Find someone else.
There are plenty around.
I've no desire to.
I respect love too much to settle
for shoddy goods.
I've rarely possessed a woman
I didn't love passionately.
The rest I can count on the fingers
of one hand.
A fly! I've been chasing this one
for days.
It had to drop into your glass.
I'll change it.
One fly less.
If she came back now,
I'd ask nothing of her.
I'd stay with her, without so much
as moving, as long as I could.
You know, she may have been
after your money.
Nonsense! Had it been my money,
she could have taken me
for much more and she knew it.
Let's go have lunch.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you. My hat, too.
Excuse me, miss,
but haven't we met?
Yes, sir, I think so.
See you tomorrow, then.
- What did you say?
- For our lunch tomorrow.
What's got into you?
Good bye, miss.
You were here?
I just came in. I start at noon.
- How long have you worked here?
- 4 days.
Why did you disappear like that,
without leaving an address
or a message?
You know very well why.
I don't, you owe me an explanation.
There's nothing to explain.
Excuse me, sir...
Don't chat with the customers.
People are waiting.
This will be my last warning.
I won't have you chatting
with the customers.
- That's it, I'm free.
- Free, how?
I just resigned.
I don't work here anymore.
Fine.
- Shall we have a drink?
- Yes, where?
- Here.
- Let's go.
Why make my mother
that proposition?
- What?
- What do you mean, what?
That she bring me to you.
You tried to buy me
Iike a piece of furniture.
And I was about to give
myself to you.
You reacted so stupidly.
You might have come and said:
I won't be bought.
What do you do instead?
You run away.
Had you said, this is what I want,
I'd surely have given it to you.
Let's sit down.
Where were you?
How do you get by?
I worked a little.
Modeled for a magazine.
We stayed with a friend for a while.
And we had your money.
And after that?
After that?
You think I couldn't make out?
That I can't live without you?
I don't want your money.
I can get by on nothing. Unlike you.
- What will you have?
- Coffee.
A brandy for me.
- We won't serve the young lady.
- What?
Sorry, sir, we won't serve
the young lady.
Let's go.
It's funny.
I was angry with you
these two months,
I didn't want to see you again.
But seeing you now
makes me feel good.
I have a house in the country.
I'd like to take you there one day.
Where is it?
Not far from Paris.
I hardly ever use it.
Mathieu...
I'll be your mistress there.
When? Today?
No, the day after tomorrow.
What is it? A power failure?
Yes, sir, the power station blew up.
- An accident?
- No, sabotage.
Hello, Adrienne.
I set out some candles.
I hope they'll do.
I'm sure they will.
- Shall I prepare some food?
- Don't bother. We ate on the way.
- ls the room ready?
- Of course, sir.
Put them there.
- Will you be needing anything?
- No. Goodnight.
Who's that?
- My wife.
- I didn't know you...
She died seven years ago.
I loved her very much.
- This was her room?
- Of course.
Then I don't want to be here.
- lsn't there another bedroom?
- lt's not made up.
Then have it made up.
All right.
Prepare the room down the hall.
Right away, sir.
You told your mother
you were leaving?
No, why?
She might worry, or get angry.
My mother?
If she saw me streetwalking,
she'd say:
"Qué gracia!
Isn't she a charmer!"
- lt will be ready in five minutes.
- Fine.
Doesn't your mother matter?
Not in the least.
I raised myself and I do exactly
as I please, all the time.
That's how it is!
Oh, Mateo...
Mi amor.
I think I'm going to faint.
Sit down.
Sit here.
I love you but I almost passed out.
Lie down. Want a glass of water?
No, stay with me.
- Will you love me for a long time?
- Of course.
Even when I'm old and gray,
will you still love me?
Say it, even if it's not true,
to give me strength.
I'll love you until the very end.
After you, I'll never love
anyone else.
If you leave me, I'm as good
as dead.
You know, Mateo,
I promised for tonight,
but I haven't the strength.
- The room is ready.
- Thank you, Adrienne.
I'll take the bags.
Come.
Good night.
Goodnight, Adrienne.
I won't disturb you again.
Take this off.
- Can I go and change?
- Yes, in there.
I'll be right out.
- The window...
- What?
Close the window.
- No one can see us.
- lt doesn't matter.
See how beautiful I am?
- Do you like me?
- Oh, yes, I like you.
- You like me a lot?
- Yes, why ask?
No. Later.
I'm not in the mood now, that's all.
Not in the mood!
No, not now.
It's been too long. I've had enough.
I've been more patient
than a man could be.
- I didn't promise you anything.
- What?
I don't owe you a thing.
Watch out, Conchita. I could grow
tired of being teased.
Grow tired?
I won't stand for this behavior
forever.
You won't?
I won't be your lover tonight.
Not tonight, not tomorrow.
Enough! Take off your nightgown!
Put out the candles!
Please!
Come into my arms, don't be afraid.
You kept me waiting so long,
but now...
Don't cry victory too fast.
Your skin is so smooth,
and your belly...
- What's this?
- What?
What's this I feel?
What are you wearing?
Take that off!
I'll tear it off, you'll see.
Leave me alone, you won't do it.
What in Christ's name is this?
Leave me alone.
I tore at it for 10 minutes,
I struggled.
What with all the knots and laces,
and Conchita's resistance...
Nothing doing!
Impossible to tear the thing off.
Isabelle, go play outside
with the little boy.
- But, Mommy, I want to hear.
- Go and play!
I think I've been very proper.
Nothing I said was likely to...
True, but children today,
you know...
Do go on.
I don't like what I'm doing either.
You want what I won't give you.
It's not me you want.
You'll just have to wait.
It will happen, little by little.
You know I'm yours alone,
what more can you ask?
Tell me...
You want me to come live
with you?
Keep the change.
She's 10 minutes late.
She'll be here.
She went to see her mother.
How are things with the mother?
I send her some money
but I never see her.
You like things as they are?
No. I want to possess her, naturally,
but when she's with me, I'm
overjoyed. That's all I ask for.
You really can't live without her?
Everyone knows you're living
together.
So why don't you marry her?
If I married her,
I'd be entirely defenseless.
Sit down.
How are things?
- Fine.
- What will you have?
The young lady is here...
Delighted to see you again, miss.
May I offer you some champagne?
Excuse me.
Would you buy me a 16mm camera?
We'll look at some nice ones later.
Come on.
- I'd like to ask you something.
- Go ahead.
Why do you insist we make love?
To be closer to you, because
I love you.
I love you, too. But I don't feel
Iike making love with you.
We're together.
You hold me in your arms,
I caress you,
you have my legs, my mouth,
my breasts.
So why make love, too?
Because it's normal. lt's natural.
All people in love do it.
Then you think I'm not normal.
Let's go.
HlJACKED JUMBO JET EXPLODES:
290 DEAD
Wait, I'll just wash up.
- You're not tired?
- On the contrary.
I feel in form tonight.
We'll see.
Come quick.
You didn't forget? Like every night.
No, I didn't forget. Come on.
I won't do anything.
- You promise?
- Of course.
- Otherwise, I'll leave right now.
- Come here.
Must I wait much longer?
If I gave you what you want,
you'd stop loving me.
You only stay for my money.
For the comfort I provide you.
Unlike you, money means nothing
to me. I know where to find it.
Perhaps I'm too old for you.
You?
Certainly not.
I hate young people.
They're such idiots.
I love people who've lived.
Like you.
But, Conchita...
What?
There are several ways
to make a man happy...
- What do you mean?
- And still remain a virgin.
Oh, no! Who do you think I am?
What if I die before you do?
That can't happen.
Why not? I think I have a weak
heart, like my father.
Don't talk nonsense.
Anyway, watch out,
if you take another woman,
I'll come plague you every night.
What was that?
- See anything?
- Not very well.
A demolished car, someone
Iying on the ground.
Get away! Don't stand there.
- What is it?
- Terrorists or a gang killing.
We'll find out tomorrow.
That was scary.
I don't feel like staying now.
You stayed longer yesterday.
That was yesterday, this is today!
Give me time to get used to you.
No, get out!
Conchita, open up!
Open up, I said!
I'm drying myself.
One more minute!
What are you doing here?
I let him in.
He got thrown out of his hotel.
He's slept here for
the past 3 nights.
Relax, we sleep back to back.
Just like you and I do.
- Go on, get out!
- Leave him alone.
Out! Get lost!
Leave him alone!
Take your things.
I've known it since the day
I met you.
Deep down, you're cold and
heartless. lf he goes, I go.
Sure, go on, get out!
Get out, the two of you!
I'll give you ten minutes.
Then I call the police.
I'll wait for you outside.
I've had enough of you, too.
Ten minutes, you hear?
I'll be gone before that, gladly!
But don't come running after me.
I'll never come back.
May God be your witness!
I never want to see you again.
Hear me? Never!
I can't take it anymore.
One of these days, I'll go see her.
- How humiliating!
- I don't care.
I can't sleep or do anything.
Give me an idea.
I told you: Take a trip, go to Brazil.
Or China.
Wherever you want.
I want someone to prevent me
from seeing her.
You, for instance.
Can't you do anything?
I don't see how. And if I did,
you'd never forgive me.
Don't worry.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
I'll see what I can do.
Coming.
- Who is it?
- Police, open up.
Don't be afraid, ma'am.
We're friends.
May l?
Would you come here, please?
You are lncarnación Perez?
This is your daughter, Concepción?
You have 24 hours to leave
the country.
Here is the expulsion order.
You've been declared
undesirable aliens.
But what have we done?
That's not my business.
I'm just carrying out orders.
You have till tomorrow morning.
How long will you be away, sir?
I don't know. Perhaps a week,
or a year or two.
But you'll come with me, Martin.
- Where are you going?
- We'll find out right now.
I'll close my eyes.
Spin me around a few times.
- Where's the map?
- Right in front of you, sir.
Fine, we're going to Singapore.
Start packing.
What's the weather like there?
Who the hell cares?
What will we do in Singapore
at 3 p.m., sir?
Have a nap.
- But you didn't go to Singapore.
- No, but...
- You went to Seville.
- You amaze me!
Not at all. You knew
she was from Seville.
You changed your mind,
it's quite human.
Subconsciously, we know
there's no such thing as chance.
You're right, I went to Seville.
Whenever you wish, sir.
I'm coming.
A beautiful woman loves you
but you don't treat her right.
You're very rich but you're mean.
For both of you.
Superb, isn't it?
Frankly, sir, architecture
isn't my strong point.
By the way, Martin...
You've been with me
for several years
yet I don't know a thing about you,
about your private life.
There's nothing to know.
What's your opinion on women?
My opinion is of no importance.
It's important to me.
In that case, sir...
I have a friend who loves
women very much,
but he claims they're sacks
of excrement.
Why say such a thing?
It's not me who says it.
You can go, Martin.
I have a dinner invitation
for tonight.
You're forgetting your sack.
I'll have it picked up.
I don't believe this!
Is it really you?
Running into you like this!
It's incredible!
- You knew I was here?
- Not at all!
How I've missed you! I thought
you didn't love me anymore.
Let me look at you.
- Have you been here long?
- Several days.
What misfortune we've had.
We were expelled from France.
- Expelled?
- By the police. Just like that!
3 days to get here from the border!
Without a cent.
Luckily, Conchita found a job.
I won't bother you two.
You must have lots to say.
See you soon, Don Mateo.
- Where are you staying?
- I rented a house.
You were cruel, throwing me out
in the middle of the night.
So you have a job?
Yes, just around the corner.
In a club called the Gurugu.
Come see me dance, tonight.
Will you?
Mi amor.
Mi alma.
Let me kiss you!
- Después.
- What?
Later.
All I can give you for now is this.
- You like this life?
- Very much.
Anyway, it's the only one I have.
What if I asked you to live with me,
forget about all this.
Are you serious?
I'd leave right away, Mateo.
I'm so happy that you came back.
Before, I didn't trust you.
But I've changed a lot, you know.
I'm not the same. You'll see.
I used to be a bit unpredictable.
I know.
But I've calmed down.
Me too, I've thought things over.
You must see me dance every night.
Now that we're together again,
we stay together.
I'm going, I'm going.
Going where?
Upstairs.
They make us take half-hour naps.
If not, we daydream on stage.
Wait for me.
That's me.
Conchita's told me so much
about you.
How do you do? Sit down.
Care for a drink?
- You're a friend of Conchita's?
- I adore her. She's an angel.
You're not as old as she said.
- She said I'm very old?
- So-so.
Also that you're very kind.
And maybe a little naive.
She told you she went to rest up?
Yes, she's taking a rest.
What's so funny?
- You are.
- Why?
Want to know how she's resting?
Go straight up those stairs
and you'll find the room
she's resting in.
Good luck.
What are you doing here?
Get out, all of you!
Get out!
Get the hell out!
Move it!
Out, all of you!
You, too! Get the hell out!
Come with me!
I'm not leaving
and don't you touch me.
What's your excuse now?
You're such a good liar!
Are you accusing me?
You break in, chase everyone out...!
Shut up!
You may get me fired
but I'm to blame!
You're so stupid!
- So this is your job?
- You knew it was.
- I did?
- So innocent!
We dance nude for tourists.
Even kids know that.
Don't tell me you didn't know!
No, I didn't.
Idiot!
You only act of out jealousy.
What right have you!
You're not my father
and you're not my lover.
If you belong to someone, tell me.
I swear I'll leave Seville tomorrow.
I belong to no one but myself,
and I'll stay my own.
I've nothing more precious
than myself.
- And those men?
- I don't even know them.
They came with a guide.
They're on their way to Tangier.
That's all I know.
Look around you.
Does this resemble a bedroom?
Look, where do you see a bed?
I can't go on living like this.
You have to be honest with me.
Even if it's for the last time.
If you stay one more day
in this place,
it's over between us.
You've never understood me.
You think you're chasing me
and that I won't have you.
It's the opposite.
I'm the one who loves you,
who wants you for life.
I've never loved anyone but you.
First, because you're handsome.
You have such gentle, shining eyes.
The nights I've thought of your
eyes! lt drove me crazy.
I love happiness
and I know you'll make me happy.
I'll give you everything.
You need only ask for it.
I don't want much, you know.
A little house of my own,
some money if I stop dancing.
In Seville?
It's yours. Just say when.
All I can do is love you madly,
and stay intact for you.
You look so lovely today.
You don't know how happy I am.
It's all yours now.
- Afraid of burglars?
- I'm afraid of no one.
Not even you, Mateo.
Come see upstairs.
Is your mother moving in with you?
In which room?
My mother? She'll never live here.
Just you and me.
Take this, too.
- What is it?
- The deed to the house.
It's all I wanted.
Nothing can come between us now.
And I can entertain you in secret
at midnight.
Tonight!
Don't hold your breath.
What?
Tomorrow night, at midnight.
Good, you're on time.
I was waiting for you.
Kiss my hand.
Kiss the hem of my dress
and my foot.
There. That's good.
Now go away.
What did you say?
I said, now go away.
You're laughing?
You make me laugh!
It's just too much. Look at me,
Mateo.
Look how happy I am.
I'm free of you. Free for
the rest of my life, understand?
Open this gate!
Open it with your teeth.
Don't go just yet.
I still have a lot to say to you.
I can't stand you!
Your slightest touch makes me sick.
I feel like throwing up.
I try to run away but you always
catch up with me,
and your hands touch me again,
you take me in your arms,
you kiss me with your mouth.
The things I felt when you
forced me into your bed!
At night, I'd spit after each
of your kisses!
I prayed to God that you'd die
after I'd ruined you.
I've said it all, you can go now.
Go on, go away!
Go away, Mateo!
You won't go?
Then stay here and watch!
Here he is, here's my lover.
He's handsome, and young.
Come on.
Take this.
You want to stay?
If you want to watch...
watch!
I knew you'd be back.
Good night.
My guitar is mine.
I'll play it for whom I please.
The previous day's fighting
claimed 200-300 casualties,
mostly among civilians.
The BTX virus is approaching
Barcelona
where emergency measures
have been taken.
No antidote has been found
to neutralize the virus...
No, thanks. Turn off the radio.
After what happened last night,
I came to see if you were dead.
Already cold.
I thought you loved me enough
to go off and kill yourself.
I have something to say,
but not here.
Let me explain what happened
Iast night.
Where are you going?
You just don't understand women.
You think that by giving me
a house, you own me.
But you don't.
You're not listening to me?
You'll never have me.
Listen to me.
That scene last night
was all a charade.
I won't tell you.
Listen to me!
El Morenito isn't my lover!
He doesn't even like women!
We were both play-acting.
Nothing more!
Now I know you love me.
Mateo, I'm still a virgin.
They're having a fight.
Here.
The key.
For you. You can come whenever
you want.
You have to admit she had
that licking coming.
That was yesterday morning.
That's it. lt's all over now.
That's the story. You can see
why I spoke of killing her.
Certainly.
An announcement
about a strange alliance:
Several extreme-left groups,
known to the public,
the P.0.P., the P.R.I.Q.U.E.,
the C.L.A.W. and the R.U.T.,
have suddenly joined forces
in a vast campaign of bombings,
under the direction of the R.A.B.J.
"Revolutionary Army
of the Baby Jesus."
These wanton
and incomprehensible bombings
are designed to disrupt our society
and spread total confusion.
A number of far-right
terrorist groups,
notably the P.A.F. and the S.T.l.C.,
say they'll meet the challenge
of the extreme left
and contribute to this operation
of total subversion.
The Archbishop of Sienna
is still in a coma
after a bullet in last week's attack
struck his carotid artery.
What is most serious
is that though he still breathes
normally through the windpipe,
he is virtually brain-dead.
Msgr Fiossole could remain
in this vegetable state for months.
The reaction of the Roman Curia
has had a considerable effect
and even the Communist Party
has published
a statement condemning
this vile attack.
And now, for a change of mood,
Iet's listen to some music...
