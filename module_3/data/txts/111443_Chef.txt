You walk here?
All right, good.
Turn around.
Legs out.
The bag.
I gotta still hit the farmer's
market. What time is it?
Ten-ish.
- It's ten?
- Mm-hmm.
I gotta pick up the kid.
Where's Tony?
Tony and I were out
late last night.
But don't worry,
he's-he's gonna be here.
You got this?
Yes. He's not gonna flake.
Neither am I.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Yes, Chef.
Wake up. We got a
critic coming today.
Why do you think
I slept here for, bro?
Let's get going on the soup.
We're behind on the egg prep.
And let's get the mise on the
steak. You still shitfaced?
No, I'm good.
I'm good, Chef.
All right. Help Martin
with the pig. We got the pig.
Lechon.
Hey, Pal.
Hey.
Buckle up, buddy.
Sorry I'm late.
I'm used to it.
Listen, pal, I don't think
we're going to have time
to catch a movie today.
Is it 'cause you're
getting reviewed?
Yeah, how'd you know about that?
Mom told me.
What'd she say?
She said you might
be a little worried.
She said that I was worried?
Yeah.
Well, Morn doesn't
know me that well. Okay?
She's pretty spot on about you.
Oh... oh, yeah? You know what
Mommy thinks I should be doing?
What?
She thinks I should
get a food truck.
I like food trucks.
Yeah, I like food trucks.
Who doesn't like food trucks?
Can you picture me driving
around in a food truck?
I'm a chef.
I work in a restaurant.
Okay.
Listen, I gotta go
to the Farmer's Market,
pick up some ingredients.
Okay. Can I come?
I was thinking I'd drop
you off at the restaurant.
- Molly's there.
- No, I want to go with you.
You're not going to be asking
me for everything you see?
No.
It's not about you eating.
It's about me buying groceries.
- I know.
- Okay. Good.
You got the purple and white?
Just orange.
- Just orange?
All right, give me six bunches
of those or eight of the small.
Hang on a second, buddy.
And on the radishes here,
I use the tops, okay?
I need consistent tops.
Dad.
Is that what's happening?
Six of these.
Let's see what we got.
- Dad.
What do you want, Percy?
What do you want?
Can I please have kettle corn?
Daddy's working, okay? No,
you're not gonna get kettle...
Why don't you get
a nice piece of fruit?
I don't want fruit.
How can you even
ask for kettle corn?
You know what kettle corn is?
No.
Kettle corn is carbs
covered with sugar, okay?
Look at this piece of fruit.
Huh? It's beautiful.
How could you even
want kettle corn with a
gorgeous piece of fruit
like this in front of you?
Why don't you have
a piece of fruit?
So apparently they're sending
a big reviewer who's also
some huge food blogger.
You know what a food blogger is?
Yeah.
A guy who writes about
food on the internet.
I know what a food blogger is.
Well, this guy's a big one
and a lot of these big guys-
they don't like me.
They got it in for me because
I got good write-ups
when I started out.
They're haters.
Exactly.
We didn't have that word
when I was growing up.
There was no word for hater.
The most you would say is
that somebody was like jealous
which didn't really capture it.
Look, the sausage guy is here.
You ever try Andouille sausage?
No.
It's spicy.
You like spicy?
No.
It's not so spicy.
Come on.
That's from New Orleans.
You ever heard of New Orleans?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
It's part of the United States.
It's part of The Louisiana
Purchase from Napoleon.
Yeah.
Um, that was...
I mean like now.
That was a long time ago.
Eighteen-oh-three.
Whatever.
I'm talking about the food,
the culture, you know?
Like this Andouille sausage.
Beignets.
You ever hear of that?
We can get it here.
Not the same.
When you have it here, it's good
because it reminds you of like a
whole world of memories that
you have of being there. 'Cause
it's like, I'm telling you, it's
like a whole different world.
We should go there sometime.
Definitely.
For real?
Yeah.
I mean not now.
- But like...
- When?
I don't know. I got...
Everything's very full for me.
I got this reviewer coming.
After the review?
Yeah, after the review.
That would be good.
I'm off school next month.
Next month? Yeah,
we could go next month.
- Awesome.
- Or whatever.
Or like if you're... if it
doesn't wo... I'll ask Mom.
If it doesn't work out next
month we'll go later or
something. But we'll
definitely check it out.
I already did.
She's cool with it.
You asked her already?
Mm-hmm.
Where'd you get a phone? How
come you have a phone already?
Do... Everybody your
age have phones?
Yo, Popeye, get
the sauce on there, okay?
Whose bacon is this,
huh? I gotta watch this too?
When I find out who
it is, grab your ankles
'cause here comes Papi Chulo.
Where we at? Talk to
me, people. How we doing?
The stock's simmering, the pig's
broken down, bacon a fine.
The stock is simmering.
That means reducing.
Good. Guys, big night tonight.
You all know what's happening?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah? Okay, let me
know as soon as he gets here.
I want people having fun
at all the tables around.
And call your pretty friends.
Bring them in.
Tell them the tickets are on me.
All right?
And the stemware looks crooked.
Let's get out there. Don't
make me get the fucking ruler
out again, please. Thank you.
On Chef.
I got the good shit.
You see this, Martin?
Look at that.
That's a specimen.
...baby carrots.
I got you curry paste with...
Carl?
Not right now, please.
Where the fuck did you
get these juicy ass tomatoes?
Riva's here.
Okay, you got it?
Let's get...
What the hell's Riva doing here?
I don't know. I... He was on
his way back here. I got him
an espresso. Bought you
maybe five minutes of time.
You should meet him
out on the floor.
Just-Just stall
him for five minutes.
Let me get the
staff going, please.
Okay. Fine.
Expect him to come back here.
Yeah, thank you.
How you gonna keep
that psychopath from coming
back here? Huh?
You got to have a plan.
Boss, you want me
to pickle these?
Yeah, pickle these.
I want you to pickle...
Is Carl in there?
Yeah.
Hey, Carl!
Carl.
Are you, uh, are you planning
on altering the menu?
Yeah. I can't do this
right now. Please just...
You know a lot is
on the line today.
I know. That's why the
menu has to be perfect.
Yeah, but I can
help you plan it.
I can't do this right now.
Just give me five minutes
to get my staff going.
I'll come out and walk
you through the menu.
Carl, I've done this before.
I can help guide you.
I don't... I don't need guidance
right now. I need space.
Okay?
Thank you.
Could we have a
little privacy, uh, guys?
Huh?
I ask you to leave,
you gotta look at Carl?
Okay, everybody, to-tomen
cinco, take five.
- You good?
- I got it.
Go, go, go.
Grab a coffee.
Let's get something straight.
Yeah.
You don't fucking talk
to my staff like that. I talk
to my staff. That side of the
pass is you, this side is me.
That was the arrangement that
we had when you hired me.
Okay, now will you
listen to me for a minute?
Carl, I get ideas.
Sometimes my ideas work.
I really don't care what
magazine said that you're the
next big thing. The fact is you
work for me in my restaurant,
right? I've had chefs
before you in this kitchen.
I'll have chefs after you. Okay?
All right, good talk.
Let me get back to work.
You know who's coming tonight.
We're being reviewed by the most
important critic in the city.
Yes. I'm aware.
You know that his online
blog was sold to AOL for
'IO million dollars.
...That's right.
You knew that?
- Yes, I know.
- Okay.
He's a big deal and that's why
I wanna cook him a good menu.
You wanna give him a...
You wanna cook a good menu?
Yeah. I wanna
cook him some good food.
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, then...
And our place is
in a fucking creative rut.
In a rut?
In a creative rut.
You-you do know that
we're doing better than any
place in the neighborhood?
I'm not talking about how
much money we're making.
I'm talking about creatively,
the food that we're serving.
It's the same food we've
been serving for five years.
Do you remember what happened
when you put guts on the menu?
Are you talking about my
sweetbreads, is that...
Was that what you meant by guts?
Yeah. When you put that artsy
shit on the menu, people
don't like it. Not one person
ordered your sweetbreads.
Please listen to me. I sank a
fortune into the remodel to get
you the French, uh, cooking top,
whatever it is, that tabletop.
French cooking suite.
Right. Not every
chef gets that.
You know why you get it?
- I appreciate...
- Do you know why?
Because you deserve it.
See, you don't know that.
But I know it.
You deserve it.
So be smart just for tonight.
Look, if you bought Stones
tickets and Jagger didn't
play Satisfaction,
how would you feel?
Would you be happy?
No.
No! You'd burn the place
to the fucking ground.
Your menu works.
People love it.
Carl, do what you want tonight.
Okay? You're the chef.
You know what I think?
I think you should
play your hits.
All right, let's go.
Pre-shift, guys.
Big night tonight.
Here's what we're doing.
We're gonna go with
the favorites, starting
the with the caviar egg,
scallop, French onion soup
frisee salad, lobster risotto
filet and we're gonna finish
strong with a crowd pleaser,
chocolate lava cake.
Talk to Molly about
wine pairings.
Let me know when he gets here.
And let's have fun.
Put your heart in it, people
big night. Let's have some fun.
Good, good.
Dad. Dad!
Dad!
Come on, let's go.
Look! It's up, it's up.
It's up, it's up, it's
up, the review's up.
To the review, here we go.
- To you, baby, to you.
- Here we go.
- My culinary hero.
- To the team.
Gauloises: Eager to Please.
Whoo! Hey, hey!
Ten years ago I had the good
fortune to dine at Chef Casper's
revelatory Miami bistro Marrow.
- Miami in the house!
- Marrow, baby!
That's your house!
The sheer audacity of this
fresh, brave voice of the
culinary scene reminded me why I
write about food as a vocation.
It is nearly impossible to
separate my glowing regard for
Chef Casper and how much he
inspired me from my expectations
as I sat down to dine at
the recently remodeled
Brentwood Gallic
staple Gauloises.
Yeah, this is good!
Oh, how times have changed.
Over the last decade Carl Casper
has somehow managed to transform
himself from the edgiest chef
in Miami to the needy aunt that
gives you five dollars every
time you see her in hopes that
you will like her but
instead causes you to shrink
from her cloying embrace which
threatens to smother you in
her saggy moist cleavage.
The signature app,
intended to impress the
country club brunch
crowd is the Caviar egg.
A shirred egg topped with a
dollop of caviar is an excuse
for the chef to overcharge
us for his insecurity
and lack of imagination.
Carl Casper can
best be summed up
by the first bite of his needy
and yet by some miracle also
irrelevant Chocolate Lava Cake.
Casper didn't even have the
courage to undercook
the cake, thus curiously lacking
its signature molten center.
This sad dessert is
emblematic of Carl Casper's
disappointing new chapter.
His dramatic weight gain can
only be explained by the fact
that he must be eating all the
food sent back to the kitchen.
Two stars.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
Everyone loved it.
He loved it even.
Then Why'd he write all
that mean shit about me?
About my food?
Who cares?
Who cares?
I do, 'cause I could
have done better.
I should have cooked the
shit I-l was gonna cook.
You're ignoring the fact that
everyone was happy and you're
making a problem where there's
no... there's no problem.
You know... It's not hard
to make people happy.
There are certain things you
could put on a menu that will
make everybody happy.
If you put Ahi Tuna on a
menu, it will sell out.
It's guaranteed.
You know that.
But I cooked the beef cheek
which is a-a better dish
and nobody... nobody
wants to even try it.
It was good though.
Yeah, for family meal.
Well, who you
cooking for though?
That's my point.
Why do I have to pick?
Why do I have to choose?
Why can't I have both?
There are chefs that cook
food that they believe in
and people will try it because
they're open to a new experience
and they'll end up liking it.
What do you want
me to say to you?
The truth.
You want me to tell you that
you're the best chef that I ever
worked with.
And it's true because you are.
You are, Carl. You are the
best chef I've ever worked with.
Okay.
I mean it.
Well, thank you.
You're welcome.
We both agreed not to do that.
I know. Why don't I
just cook you something?
Okay, fuck it, let's go.
Mmm.
Mom wants to talk to you.
Inez?
Inez.
Are you okay?
I got two stars. Okay?
Two stars is good, right?
I mean, I don't
read that shit normally,
but, you know, then he
starts writing all this personal
shit about me and... How many
people you got working?
You got like fifty
people working here.
And Percy's ten years old.
Does he still need a nanny?
He's in school all day.
What does she even do here?
Hi, Flora.
Hi, Mr. Carl.
I mean, what does he need...
What's she doing here?
You know that he's hurt, right?
Because I was late? I already
apologized to him. We're fine.
Late?
He waited for you for
one hour alone, outside.
Well, I didn't realize
it was that long.
It's just...
That was the day that...
You're right.
I didn't like what
they wrote about you.
I didn't like it either.
It hurt, all right?
You okay?
I'm-I'm all right.
Good.
I'm gonna make it up to him.
That was fun, right?
Yeah. Where you going?
I gotta work on a menu.
It's still early.
Can I watch?
Yeah, sorry, it's at work.
I won't get in the way.
Yeah, I gotta go work.
Okay. Bye.
We'll have fun next week.
Okay.
What the hell are
you doing here, man?
What's this madness, huh?
This is crazy.
You didn't go home, did you?
No. Come here.
Go home, man, go home,
you've been here all night.
Go home. Get some
sleep. Fuck Twitter.
Come on, get out of here.
Fuck Twitter, what are you
talking about, Fuck Twitter?
I mean, you know, fuck 'em.
That's what I mean.
I mean, who reads
that shit anyhow?
I'm not on Twitter. I don't
know what you're talking about.
Nothing, just-just
classic bullshit. What is that?
That's carne asada.
Check it out.
Ahh.
Wow!
Good?
It's fucking unbelievable, man.
Is it?
Holy shit!
No, seriously.
No, I'm serious.
Tell me the truth.
I'm-I'm telling you the truth.
This... it's incredible.
Is it good seasoning?
The seasoning's perfect.
Roll that shit! Chef
Big Dog up all night cooking!
Come on in, buddy.
Come here, come here.
- Tony, check this out.
Shut up and taste this,
Amuse Douche. Come here.
What we got?
- Wow.
- It's good?
Huh? Look at that.
Too much heat?
Ah, it's perfect, Chef.
It's good? Seasoning?
Ah, it's perfect.
It's nice and spicy.
You like it?
Oh, man.
Ha, Jefe? Look at that.
I know.
Yeah? Is it good?
It's fucking great.
- Don't fuck with me.
- But it's so good.
Don't mess with me.
It's flavorful as fuck, man.
L... It's nice, right?
Is it good?
Yo, Big Dog, fuck Twitter.
Fuck Twitter.
Again with the Fuck Twitter.
What... why... why
should I Fuck Twitter?
Wha... You're not on Twitter?
No.
What, you're getting too
much pussy is the problem?
It's gotta be, right?
What does Twitter
have to do with pussy?
Wha... Have you not heard of
the term social networking?
Yeah.
Well, that's what it is.
It means pussy?
Like, pussy or like getting
tickets to something
or finding about a new band.
Air spring, flash mob.
Yeah, shit like that. Anything
that requires a database.
So pussy requires a database?
Yeah.
So show me what-
what's on Twitter that's
so bad that I should see.
Oh, shit, is that Gochujang?
Nothing.
Damn, you made
fucking Gochujang?
Yeah, that's under...
That's under the squab.
But he's gonna 86 it.
Riva's gonna 86
it, baby, I know.
Yo, this Gochujang is good.
Don't worry about fucking...
Yeah, he ain't gonna let you
serve that Korean shit.
Let me handle him. Don't
worry about that. I got it.
He says I can cook
whatever I want.
All right. All right.
We're gonna cook like this.
Did you try that?
It... Oh... hey.
That's-that's broccoli
rabe l'anchois.
Oh, check this... Check this out.
This is ridiculous. What
have got over there?
I got...
Mom cuts off the crust.
Yeah, well, I don't.
Mmm.
It's good.
You bet your ass, it's good.
Can you turn that down, please.
Oh, sorry.
You know about Twitter?
Yeah, I have an account.
Yeah?
How's it work?
It's cool.
It's cool? That's how
it works, it's cool?
You tweet on it.
Is that like texting?
No.
Sign me up.
Okay.
So what do you want
your user name to be?
Carl.
You can't just put Carl.
It has to be at something.
At Carl Casper.
At Carl... Casper.
Taken.
Someone took my name?
@ChefCarlCasper?
Is that cool?
Yeah, that's good.
At Chef Carl Casper.
So is this for sex?
Ew! Is that what
you're doing this for?
No, I'm not doing it for that.
Someone wrote something bad.
I wanna see what they wrote.
Good.
Oh, shit.
Hey! You can't talk like that.
I don't care if
Mommy's not around.
I don't want you
cursing around here.
That review went viral.
What does that mean?
It means it got picked up
and re-tweeted everywhere.
So all these people
have read the review?
Yeah.
Oh, shit.
I think it's kinda cool.
I don't.
No, I mean, us doing this.
Doing what?
You know, just hanging out.
We hang out all the time.
No, like hanging
out doing something.
Well, we-we do things.
No, not just like watching
something or doing something.
Like, hanging out and talking.
And learning things
from each other.
Well, I figured, you know,
with... with you living at Mom's
house and me working all the
time that when we hung out,
you liked to do fun things.
I think this is kinda fun.
You know, just
figuring stuff out.
Like when you lived at home.
Yeah, I miss that too.
Then why don't you
move back home?
Percy, I can't just...
You're-
you're not the...
You're not the
reason that I'm not living at
home, you know that, right?
Mm-hmm.
'Cause it's true.
Then why?
Then why what?
Well, why don't you live home?
Well, mommy and daddy,
you know, we-
we both grew apart in
different directions.
But we're still
really good friends.
It's just better if we don't
live in the same house.
And that we're not married.
Oh.
You understand?
No.
It's hard to explain.
Hey, listen, could we
Twitter each other when
we're not in the same place?
Yeah.
Cou-could you show
me how to do that?
Yeah.
Okay.
So first you click here and you
have to enter your user name.
Right.
You could also log
in on your iPhone.
Uh-huh.
You click this button here.
It posts your feeds so all
your followers can read it.
Fuck it.
Dad?
Yeah.
You got 1,653 followers
since last night.
Oh, is that good?
It's amazing.
Oh, good.
What does it mean?
It means that 1,653 people are
reading your Twitter feed.
Mm-hmm. I thought
it was like texting.
Did you post
anything since last night?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I just sent a private
message to somebody.
To who?
To that A-hole food critic.
You could only send private
messages to people who are
following you. I think you might
have posted that publically.
No, he wrote something nasty
about me and then I hit reply
and it let me send
a message to him.
Dad, replies are public.
Everybody can read them.
And it looks like
he re-tweeted it to all
his 123,845 followers.
And he wrote back.
What did he say?
I don't think I should read it.
Just-can you
read it to me, please?
Read the...
Read the reply.
@ChefCarlCasper
I would rather have you sit on
my face after a brisk walk on a
warm day than suffer through
that fucking Lava Cake again.
He wrote that to me?
He wrote it to everybody.
You gotta be kidding me.
You realize how
many people have read this?
I'm up to two thousand
followers since last night.
- You're trending, bro.
- They're sending me messages.
They're goading me into
responding to this prick.
Well, don't do it.
Don't do it.
Don't do it, man. Don't respond.
Don't do... Take the high road.
I know, but half the people
are saying he's right.
Yeah, but-but half the people
are saying he's wrong.
That's the fucking
internet, bro.
That's right, listen to him.
That's social media.
You on Twitter?
Yeah, I'm Twitter.
What's your name?
Little Marty. But all the
people following me are people
I don't even want to hang out
during the day. I avoid all...
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
hey, what are you doing?
Don't do it. What are you...
What are you writing?
Chef, don't... that's
not a good idea.
I said...
Just listen.
I won't send it until
we all say it's okay.
Why don't you come by again
tonight, I got a whole new
menu just for you, asshole.
- Oh, no, no, give me that.
- That's not good.
Give me the phone!
Gi-give me the phone!
That's out there now, bro.
Why would you do that?
You can't take that back.
You know what?
I threw down the gauntlet.
So get ready for a fight.
I'm gonna drop Percy off and
when I do I'm gonna come back
and cook the menu we should
have cooked last time.
So where are we going today?
I gotta drop you off, kid.
I gotta go shopping for tonight.
I'm sorry.
Can I come with you?
No, I'm sorry.
How come I'm like never
allowed to be in the kitchen?
Because it's hot and it's loud
and there's a
lot of bad language.
So, I hear bad
language all the time.
Where?
Online.
What kind of website could a
ten-year-old get
on that has bad language?
YouTube.
YouTube has bad language?
Could I at least come
shopping with you?
No.
I got a lot to do
and I got a lot on my mind.
Look who's waiting for us.
Hi, Mommy.
Come here, I missed you.
Give me a kiss.
Hi.
Urn, so my publicist said
that she can talk to you.
Why don't you talk to her?
About what?
About Twitter?
Everybody's reading
what you wrote.
I don't think you get it.
Get what?
Carl, let's call her.
Go inside with me and call her.
Yes, please, tell her
to call me immediately.
I have Carl with me.
I'm at home. Thank you.
All right.
I'm gonna go.
No, no, she's gonna
call right back.
She was on the other line.
I think you're making
more of this than it is.
I just don't like to
see you like this.
Like what? I'm fine.
I just have to get back to work.
You're never going to be happy
cooking for someone else.
Is this about the food truck?
I don't want to talk about
the food truck again.
Why not? You can cook your own
food. You can be your own boss.
I can book you for all the
parties that I'm doing.
I appreciate the offer,
but I don't need any
charity from you
or your ex-husband.
Why are you being so proud?
Because I'm working.
And despite what you might think
I have complete freedom
to cook whatever I want now.
I like my life.
And as far as your publicist
goes, when she calls back, you
let her know that I understand
that I shouldn't Tweet any
pictures of my dick
and any career advice should
be kept to one's self. Okay?
I'll see you later. Thank you.
I got all this shit
in the trunk. Come on.
- You want me to do this?
- Is it on?
- Yeah. We're doing it.
- We're doing it, guys.
- We're doing it tonight.
- Oh, we're on!
I want the Cambrose,
I want the delis out.
We'll start plating, okay?
Carl, can you tell me what's
going on for tonight?
No, no, no, no,
how many... how many...
How many covers
do we have tonight?
We are overbooked. But I just
printed out all the menus.
It's not the menu you-you
got printed. It's different.
No... I... that's
what I understand.
We're gonna go
with tasting menu.
A tasting menu tonight
for Ramsey Michel.
I know, but we have to...
He coming here. He knows about
it. Did you see the Eater
article? It's all over
the internet. It's great.
You know, I love it so much
when you get like this.
Taste the food. Bring in the
wait staff, have them taste the
food. I want them to understand
what we're going for.
Okay.
Okay? We're not
pushing specials today.
The whole menu is special.
- I'm excited.
I'm excited. I'm finally
happy. I'm happy, okay?
Am I allowed to
be happy at work?
Carl. Carl, we're staying
with the same menu, right?
Yeah... I have something really
good planned for tonight.
I'm gonna let you ta...
It's not sweetbreads.
You're gonna be
able to taste it.
Yeah, that may be true, but we
have the most reservations we've
had on a work night since we
opened, you realize that?
I know, I was on Twitter.
I was promoting the restaurant.
- What?
- I was on Twitter.
Yeah, that's another
thing. From now on before
you post anything online,
I okay it. All right?
The whole reason everybody's
here tonight is because I called
out Ramsey Michel online and
they're all coming to watch me
stick it in his ass.
Yeah, and you're gonna Twitter
an apology for calling the most
respected critic
in Los Angeles an asshole.
I'm not gonna fucking
apologize to that guy.
Did you see what he
wrote about me? He started it!
I don't give a fuck
what he wrote about you!
I don't care. You're a cook.
You're a chef.
This is what you've been
cooking for years and it works.
And either you cook the
menu that our customers
have come to expect...
You want me
to cook the same food?
The same exact...
The same food
that he ripped apart?
The same guy who's
coming tonight?
The restaurant isn't
filled with critics.
It's filled with
people that'd been eating
your food for
the last ten years!
So now suddenly you're
gonna be an artist.
Well, be an artist
on your own time.
Listen to me...
Listen!
No sweetbreads!
No calves' brains.
I'm not cooking sweetbreads!
Listen to me.
The kitchen is my domain.
That was our deal.
I don't give a fuck
what the deal was!
The deal is now changed.
Either you stay or you go.
It's up to you.
End of discussion.
We got a full house of people
who are coming tonight
to eat my food.
No, it's not your food, Carl.
It's not your food.
By definition, it's my food
because it's my restaurant.
I pay for the glasses.
I pay for the napkins.
I pay for the spoons.
I pay for Molly's salary.
I pay for your entire
staff's salary, okay?
So you either cook
my menu or Tony can.
Tony, you've been cooking
it half the time anyway.
Tell the truth, right?
So you're threatening
to fire me now?
Am I threatening to fire
you? No, I'm telling you what
I'm prepared to do if you don't
cook my menu. Subject closed.
Well, why don't you cook
the menu without a chef.
And we see how it goes...
We see how it goes tonight.
Let's go, Tony.
Fuck this.
Tony!
Good luck.
Oh, no way, no...
No, wait, man!
- Martin, Martin.
- No, hell no, come on.
You stay. Stay. Martin,
come on, let me go, buddy.
Don't do it.
Don't do it. Just stay.
Call me. Call me.
Tony, you got a
full house tonight.
Be a pro, okay?
Let's go!
Get the leg on, coming up.
Get that Lava Cake
out, table 22.
Bring that shit back.
Bring that shit back.
This is table 22.
Just a moment, please.
Put the pesto on it.
No, no, no, we gotta chiz
this, you didn't chiz it.
Come on, man.
How come it got there?
Welcome back.
Lovely to see you again,
Mr. Michel. Right this way.
Thank you.
I hope traffic wasn't too bad.
No, it-it wasn't.
30, I got one.
Table 30's still
missing the risotto!
I've been waiting...
What's going on with three?
There were no lobster on it!
Yes, how can I help you?
Isn't this, um
Wasn't this on the menu
last time I-I-I visited?
I believe it was.
I-I was under the impression
that-that tonight was gonna
somehow be be different,
uh, uh more of an event.
I understand.
Um, is there something we can do
to make you more comfortable?
Urn, could I actually, co-could
I speak with the chef?
W-w-ith Chef Casper?
I have a wonderful '09 that I
just opened to let breathe.
Um, if I may? The last time
I was in Napa, the vineyard,
uh they shipped me this
bottle as a gift and I've
just been waiting
for the right occasion.
That-that's very
generous of you.
Is-is Chef Casper here?
Unfortunately he
was called away.
Is he coming back?
I'm afraid that was
left, uh, ambiguous.
I need you out front.
They're three deep in the bar.
- Get off the phone.
- Please let me do my job.
Please go to the bar.
- I'll go-
- Tony!
Carl, I can't talk right
now. We are in deep weeds.
This guy's tweeting me.
This guy's calling me
out online. What the
fuck are you serving?
I-I don't know.
They're serving the same shit.
What's he eating?
- I think he's-he's-he's...
- What course is he on?
He's... he's eating the
chocolate Lava Cake right now.
You just keep him right
where the fuck he is.
What?
- I'm parking the car.
- Carl, what?
Don't let him leave.
Keep the motherfucker there!
Is he here?
Is the fucker still here?
Ah, fuck.
Let's go into the
back and we'll have-please...
I just want to say one thing.
Just want to say one thing.
Let's go to the kitchen...
Stop it, stop it for a second!
Just... just...
I've been waiting to talk to
this prick for a long time.
I am not cloying,
I am not needy. I don't care
what you think. You're not
getting to me. I'm not needy!
Chocolate Lava Cake is not just
undercooked chocolate cake.
That's not what makes
the center molten.
You take a frozen
cylinder of ganache
and you set it in the
ramekin so as the
outside cooks fully, the
inside becomes molten!
Okay.
It's fucking molten, see? It's
fucking molten, you asshole!
And you don't do anything.
What do you do?
You sit and you eat and
you vomit those words back-
to make people laugh. You know
how hard I worked for this shit?
Do you know how
hard my staff works?
What sacrifices I've made
to make you happy and then
you just smugly just
fucking shit on my shit?
Okay.
It hurts!
Yes.
It fucking hurts when you
write that shit! It hurt you.
It does. It does.
He was... you...
He thought you were gonna
close his fucking
restaurant down! You asshole!
And what do you?
You just write shit to make...
You just make shit
up! That was molten!
It's fucking molten!
Asshole!
You're not getting to me.
Okay. Okay.
You're not getting to me!
Okay, Carl.
- He's not getting to me!
- No, he's not.
I know, but you're a publicist.
Don't you have relationships?
Isn't that what
you're hired to do?
To take things like
this off the internet?
But it's out there.
Even if I could persuade one
site, to pull down one clip,
there are a dozen others
from other cell phones.
What should we... what should
we... should we at least lawyer
up and threaten legal
action or something?
You threatening them with
lawyers builds on a story that's
already getting a lot of play.
And then you get another
week of headlines.
And then you got this food
critic posting fresh blogs about
you nonstop. And they're all
getting picked up and the picked
up headlines are getting picked
up by each other. You know,
it's absolutely unbelievable.
I've never seen any...
So wait a second, you're saying
there's nothing that I could do?
To get the footage down?
No, that lives forever.
Great. Awesome.
But there just might
be an opportunity here.
How can this possibly
be an opportunity?
Well, I was holding off
until we spoke, but I'm fairly
certain we have a good
shot at Hell's Kitchen.
Wait, what?
The reality show.
I don't think you understand
what's going on here.
I'm a real chef with...
You said you needed money right?
A job. A job, not money.
I need a job like I had.
Well, your Twitter
account says you've got
twenty thousand followers.
That's pretty damn big.
Yeah, I'm gonna cancel
the account. Don't worry.
Don't cancel it! I can get you
money to mention a few products.
Are you listening to
me? I don't want to get
involved with any of
that. I wanna cook food.
You got two choices.
You can either lean into it and
work it for all it's worth...
Like Honey Boo Boo
I don't want to do that.
Do you know how much money
she pulls down or her mother?
I don't care what she makes.
Just get to your point.
Or you can go underground and
wait till the storm passes.
You got two choices.
I thought this shit
lives forever online.
It does, but there's so much
news out there and it's so fast,
and there's so much white noise,
nobody remembers anything.
Uh, okay, thank you for, uh,
taking the time and walking me
through everything.
It was very illuminating.
Oh, you're hanging
up? Okay, listen,
I want you to call
anytime. I'm right here.
If you can't get me, I'm on a
cell phone and I've got a pager.
Okay. Thank you
and thank Inez for me.
No, thank you. And
what about Hell's Kitchen?
What about it?
You still want me
to pursue it, right?
No, I don't want
you to pursue it.
Okay, I won't call
them, but I'll e-mail.
Are you not listening to...
Uh, I'm gonna go, okay?
I gotta... I gotta
call coming in.
Okay, all right. I'll tell you
how Hell's Kitchen goes
Fucking idiot.
Ah, man.
Hey, Inez.
Hi. Did you talk to Jen?
Yeah, I just got off with her.
And?
And, uh, you know it's terrible.
What do you want me to tell you?
I can't truss it up, I just
want to... I just want to cook.
Everything is going to work out.
Yeah, a half dozen places tried
to poach me when I was back at
Gauloises. I'm trying to line up
some interviews for next week.
That's good.
Yeah, so, listen, until this
whole job thing works out,
could you... could you
keep Percy for me?
But you're still taking him
with you to New Orleans, right?
Is he there?
I'll tell him.
Uh-uh. Let me-let me-let me
talk to him. Put him on.
Hey, dad. I understand if
we can't go to New Orleans.
Oh, man, thank you so
much for saying that.
I just... Daddy's so busy with
work right now. You're the best.
Maybe some other time.
Yes, we will for sure.
Thank you.
Bye.
Oh, ho-ho, Jefecito.
What's up, man?
Look, everybody, Jefe's here.
Come on, give me...
Give me some drinks.
Something premium.
Ketel One for the man.
Ah, dude.
Oh, you're everywhere.
- You saw it?
- Ah-ah-ah.
- It's bad.
- You saw it?
- How bad is it?
- You saw it?
I saw it. It's everywhere.
It's terrible, man.
You're never gonna work again.
I am though. No seriously,
there are people...
There are people who
are... who are calling me.
Dude, they are? Ah, great.
I'm glad to hear that.
I knew that you would have
something bigger than this.
I mean, that's why you don't
care about coming back here.
Yeah.
So you came back to tell
me you got me a gig?
'Cause I'll leave
Gauloises like that, baby.
No, it's... Trust
me the first phone call
as soon as something
becomes real.
Don't leave me behind again.
Don't ever do that again.
Don't hit me.
Please don't hit me. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I was on the spot, bro.
I-I had been drinking that day.
I-I-I didn't know what to do.
I'm a pussy, basically.
I'm really sorry, Chef.
It's fine.
What are you gonna do?
I shouldn't... it's a big
opportunity...
Well, but they put you
on YouTube and I felt so
responsible for that shit.
That shit was funny, by the way.
What was funny about it?
It's not funny for me.
It's just that like
everybody I know saw it so I
kinda felt like famous by
knowing you, you know?
Is it a little bit funny like
it's, like I wa... it's...
Is it they're laughing
at me or with me?
A little bit of both.
They're laughing with you
and at you at the same time.
It's so embarrassing.
Whoa, it is terrible.
It is so bad.
But it's funny too
at the same time.
It makes you kind of like,
likeable in a weird kind of way.
Yeah, he deserve...
That guy deserved it.
Everybody knows
that guy deserved it.
But seriously, I'm sorry.
It's all right. You know
I'm gonna land on my feet,
I'll get my next gig-
And-and I'm gonna be
there with you, bro.
I'm your Sous-chef
now and forever.
You're not my Sous-chef anymore.
You are a chef de cuisine.
But I wouldn't even be
there if it wasn't for you.
Chef-it doesn't matter.
Riva's right about one thing.
You are ready to run your own
kitchen, so don't blow it.
It's a big opportunity for you.
To Tony's big new opportunity.
To Tony's big opportunity.
To Chef de Cuisine.
I don't like how it happened,
but I'm happy it happened.
Okay?
Two words, man.
You guys, I love
you fucking guys.
I love you, Tony.
I love you.
Thanks, Chef.
Look at that.
I love both of you.
We love you, man. Let's have a
three-way right here. Come on.
Hang on a second,
hang on-hang on.
I love you, man.
I'm glad you made up with him.
Thanks, Dude.
You sticking with the job?
The truth of the matter
is nobody's calling me.
I got no job
prospects whatsoever.
What about those offers you got?
Nah... I got noth...
It's all dried out.
Why, from the online shit?
It must be from
the online thing.
Come on.
I'm like... I'm like a
fucking cat playing a piano.
I don't even know
what that means.
I'm everywhere. Okay?
Like, I'm like...
I'm like a meme.
You know what a
meme is? I'm a meme.
- Oh...
- I'm a fucking meme.
Carl, you need to take a break.
I've been on a break.
I've had too much of a break.
- No you need a real break.
- I need to work.
I need to get back
to work in a kitchen.
- I don't care.
- You don't. Carl.
I wish I never would have open...
I just should have cooked the...
You gonna go work for another
Riva in some other restaurant?
You've been miserable here
as long as I've known you Carl.
That's not true.
We've had a blast.
Yes, we've had a blast and
now it's time for you to go.
You don't belong here anymore,
you know it. Come on.
What's this... who's this girl?
Carl.
What?
Be real with me.
Lam.
You've been ignoring a lot of
things in your life that need
attention, like Percy.
I'm not Dad material right
now if you hadn't noticed.
I'm embarrassing.
He sees all this
shit on the computer.
- Well...
- His friends have...
Maybe it's important for you
to talk to him about it then.
I just...
He needs you, Carl.
I'm... I don't know him, okay?
He's at a weird age.
Why don't you take this
time to get to know him?
I want you to be happy.
You're not happy.
You're never gonna
be happy here.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I've never not known what I was
gonna do. I've always known.
There's always been
the next thing to do.
And now that it's all ended
and I'm-I'm like...
I'm like fucking lost.
I think that's a
good place to start.
Come here.
Mmm.
You're the best.
Yeah.
I'll hold down the
fort, I promise.
Okay. You do that.
Thank you.
Hi, Flora.
Is Percy here?
Percy aqui?
- He's inside.
- Can you tell him I'm here?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Hi.
Why are you here?
I'm hereto see, uh, to see
Percy. It's been a while.
Oh. I'm glad you're here,
but why didn't you
call to say that
you were coming?
- I don't know, because...
- He said he's sleeping.
Okay. I'm gonna go talk to him.
No, no no, wait one second.
She said he says he's sleeping.
But if he was sleeping, she
would just say he sleeping.
So he's not sleeping.
Let me talk to him.
No, wait, can you come and talk
to me for one second first?
Please. Come.
Percy and I are going to
Miami to see my father.
So why don't you come with us?
What?
Yeah, come with us.
Y-you want me to go... I-l
can't come with you to Miami.
I don't... I don't...
I got all... I don't...
I don't ev... have any money.
I need to wait to
get another job. For all
this shit to blow over
with the internet and the
Twitter and all that shit.
Yeah, but you know, I could lend
you some money before you-
I don't want your money.
I can't take charity from you.
You know that he's really
upset because he couldn't
go with you to New
Orleans, right?
He's hurt.
He misses you.
Okay.
What do you want me to do?
You know that the nannies
can't get on the plane. So why
don't you come with us and you
take care of him while I work.
So you need me to come
with you to watch Percy?
Yeah.
So I'm the nanny?
Yes, his nanny in Miami.
It might be good. That's
where it all happened for you.
That's where Percy was born,
that's where you got your first
job as a chef. Maybe it will
just like clear your mind out.
You think Percy will
be okay with that?
Percy would love it.
Hmm?
What do you say?
I have to run out for a
quick meeting so make sure
when you go upstairs,
that everything is pressed,
order him some food, make
sure he takes a nap, a bath...
Get him ready for tonight.
Wait, wait, wait,
a nap? I'm ten.
It's gonna be a long night.
We're gonna see Abuelito play.
Where? A-a-at Hoy Como Ayer?
Mm-hmm.
Isn't he a little
young for that?
Too young for what?
He's not going to
perform forever.
He wants his grandson to
see him play at least once.
All right, well, you'd
better keep an eye on him.
That place could
get pretty crazy.
Me keep an eye?
That's why you're going too.
Where are we?
This is Little Havana.
Like in Grand Theft Auto?
No, this is where I grew up.
You did?
Yes, and this is where
Abuelito lives and works.
Grandpa still works?
What does he do?
What'd he say?
Oh, he's asking if
we're back together.
No, no, we're friends.
I'm helping watch the baby.
Wait, I don't... what's
he... I don't understand.
He said that you look like
you've gained a couple of
pounds since he saw you last.
Maybe since last time I
understand, but actually,
recently I'm down... I'm
down fifteen pounds.
He's saying that he
lost twenty pounds.
I know... I know what he said.
Uh, but I'm down...
That was in two months.
I'm down in-in two
weeks I've lost fifteen.
My suit doesn't even...
Doesn't even fit me anymore.
He's saying his
pants might fall.
Twenty pounds.
Vente.
Why does he have to say twenty?
I say fifteen, he says twenty.
I could... all right.
These are really good. We should
wake up Percy so he can try one.
No. He say no, just
let him sleep. It's too late.
No, but he's never had
a-a real Cuban sandwich.
I want him to try it.
He said that you
should make him one.
I-I want him to have a real one
from here, from Little Havana.
Everything okay?
This is really good, by the way.
Yours are way better.
You think people would like
this kind of food back home?
You think people would like it?
Yeah, it's real food.
Why not?
Maybe I'll talk to Marvin.
Mmm.
Let me hear him out.
You know?
See what he's got in
mind for the food truck.
You think he's in town?
I don't know, but you know,
I can find out tomorrow.
I call him.
You know he's here.
Is this the whole reason
you brought me out?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Try this.
The yucca's amazing.
I love yucca.
You're full of shit.
Hi, I'm Carl Casper.
Um, I'm here to see Marvin.
Booties?
Excuse me?
In case you don't want
to remove your shoes.
Thank you.
Follow me, please.
Casper's here.
How ya doing?
I'm glad you're here.
Look at you.
How's it going?
Come over here.
Candy, come over here.
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Will you eat something?
I want to see you eat something.
All right?
I'm worried. Eat some crackers,
or something. Thanks.
Look at you.
She's pregnant.
Just found out.
The... this one?
Pissed on a stick, came and
laid it on me five seconds ago.
Is it... so it's yours?
I don't know.
That's what she's saying.
You don't...?
I know. I got a problem
'cause she's the best
receptionist that I've ever had.
Yeah.
Good news is
I had my tubes tied in '08
so clearly she's
also a fucking liar.
Right. That's tough.
What do you want?
You want a coconut water?
Um...
You okay?
I'm-I'm all right.
I'm all right.
- Do you want a drink?
- I would... No.
Let's make some decisions
together. Start right here.
All right, so...
Let's start off easy.
We get... No we
got shit to talk about.
Look, bang. You got four
swatches, right?
Uh-huh.
Let's start off easy
and then we'll get into
the uncomfortable
stuff. Pick it.
The... for the...
For here? I don't know.
Yeah, I'm putting a carpet down
'cause people keep slipping
around like it's a
fucking ice rink in here.
But you can always get them to
take the booties off and, uh...
Can't do that.
Then we'll go with, I don't
know, this... this one?
You like that one?
I think-if I had to-
if you're not going to paint,
I would-this just seems
like it goes with anything.
People aren't walking
on the walls, Carl.
Or I could keep it if I want.
The»?
Keep the kid
knowing that it's not mine.
Yes.
You know, for once
I'm a good guy.
She stays on my desk and I
fucking got something on her.
But you decide.
What do you think?
Are we, you know, we're talking
about the carpet now or are
we talking about the, um,
the ba... We're talking about...
I don't even know anymore.
I think, um, I'd go with the
brown and as far as that goes,
that's a personal-that's...
I... I don't know that...
You're not a turd. Okay?
And I don't want you to feel
that way coming in here with
your hat in your hand.
You went fucking crazy on the
internet. That was awesome.
You lost respect which
I love because it's passion.
You know, you lost everything.
You know, you're...
You're not a loser but you have
lost, okay? You're not a turd.
A turd that lost.
I don't know that
I feel like a turd.
Good.
I feel like I had a bad week.
I feel like I lost my job,
I made an ass of
myself on the internet.
I'm divorced, I'm
old, I got no money.
I live in a shitty
apartment in Venice.
But you know what makes
me feel like a turd?
That I'm in my ex-wife's
ex-husband's office and asking
for a fucking favor and all
he's doing is busting my balls.
I like this humility.
It's good.
Truth be told, food
trucks are a great idea.
You know what I mean?
I think we... we take it
back to something simple.
Let me see if I got
something to say anymore.
I don't even know.
I'll pay you back.
It's no problem, as long
as it's not weird for you.
I don't want you to feel like
because you were with Inez
and you guys were sleeping
together and I was
with her and we had this...
I was with her, then you
were with her and then maybe I
fucked her after. I don't even
know what happened with us.
I came out to L.A. for a
Clippers game once.
And I think we had a couple of
drinks and we went to Islands
and I think she had a...
What? What happened
between you two?
I don't even... You know what?
It doesn't matter.
Here's what happened. We're
talking about a white-on-white
'88 Chevy Grumman food truck.
It's a blank canvas for
your dreams. I'm gonna
have them pull it around.
Thank you.
Don't thank me till you see it.
Yeah, I'm in Miami now.
What happened to all
those interviews you had?
None of the
prospects panned out.
- Ah, for real?
- Yeah. It sucks.
So I guess you're gonna have to
stay there for a while, bro.
Hey, Carl, he-ey, papi, mira, I
don't know if you heard or not,
but, um, I got... I got bumped
up, man, to Sous-chef.
- Sous-chef?
- Yeah.
No shit, that's excellent.
Congratulations, man,
that's a big deal.
Thank you, man. That means a lot
coming from you, seriously.
Yeah, but enough about me,
what... so what are you gonna do?
You're gonna laugh.
I got a food truck.
Get the hell out! No shit,
you got a fucking taco truck?
Tony! Tony, Carl's
got a fucking taco truck.
For real?
Jefe! Like with
tacos and shit?
I just... Yeah, I would assume.
What are you going to cook?
You know, Cuban sandwiches,
platanos, arroz con pollo,
simple shit like we
used to do for family meal.
Oh, yeah, I remember
those days, man.
What the fuck is
he doing with a taco truck?
I would love some of
that shit right now.
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.
It could be cool.
Get the fuck off
the phone, bro, let's go!
All right. All right, all right,
all right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
man. Attila the Hun is calling
me. I gotta go, man.
All right.
Be good, man.
Is this the new truck?
This is it.
This is the truck.
Ah!
It's got good bones. It's gonna
need a lot of work though.
Ay, what doesn't?
Wanna take a look around, Champ?
Do I have to'?\
Go! Go and look at
your dad's new truck.
Can I, uh, can I
ask you a question?
Is something wrong?
Did you sleep with him?
With who?
With Marvin?
Did you sleep with Marvin?
But of course
I did. He's my ex-husband.
I mean since we were divorced.
Have you slept... Who-who did
you sleep with last, him or me?
I'm sorry, but this is
none of your business what
I did after I divorced you.
- I think it might be.
And second of all,
I don't ask you I
what you do with your
hot little waitress.
That's completely different
and that's not fair to say.
This is somebody you loved that
you shared a life with and I'm...
Why do we have to talk
about this right now?
Because I went... I-l took a
business meeting with the guy.
- This is not the moment.
- It is. I want to know why.
...A truck for me, smiling at me
like he's got something on me.
Ay, please, you know him.
You know how he is.
- I do know how him.
- Okay, so who cares?
- I care!
- Why do you need to know?
It... I just would
like to... I-I...
It doesn't bother me.
I just want to know.
Okay. just listen. I was very
sad. I was very lonely.
And you more than anyone know
how I get after like I have...
That's enough. That's enough.
That's all I wanted to know.
...A couple of drinks.
You know, I get... I don't...
I don't want to know the
details. Please.
I'm not one of your girlfriends.
And then anyways-
He was my first.
It came out like a
natural organic thing.
I don't want to know about this.
We didn't... We didn't
go through with it.
We sat there and we realized
we're just good friends.
I think there's
something dead in there.
Mmm. Okay, go and look for it.
Maybe it's a rat. I'm gonna...
I have to go, but work a
little bit and I'll be back.
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, n-no
You can't leave.
You said you were
going to help me, okay?
Go work with your dad.
It's fun.
L... I'll be back later.
Bye.
All right, take that
bucket, fill it.
You see the hose?
Mm-hmm.
Trash, trash, trash.
Save that, save that.
Save the metal ones.
Ugh!
Tip it over.
All right, Percy.
I got some presents for you.
Watch this.
Steel wool, right?
Mm-hmm.
Scrub brush. Right?
I want you to do that
on the whole truck.
Hey, buddy, you don't
have to clean that.
We're throwing it out. All
right? Clean something else.
All right, that looks good.
Clean out the low boy now.
The what?
The low... the, uh... the
reach-in fridge, right here.
Clean this out.
Ugh! That's it! That's where
the smell's coming from.
What is that?
I don't know.
Whatever it is, clean it out.
What the hell are you doing?
You told me to clean it out.
I didn't tell you to
throw it in the garbage.
That's a perfectly good
hotel pan. Scrub it out.
No, that's gross!
I'm not cleaning that out.
Pick it out of the garbage.
Are you kidding?
It's disgusting.
You don't throw it
in the garbage. Like we saved
all the rest of the stuff.
Let's just clean it out.
No.
Pick it out of the trash.
No.
Pick it out of the trashcan.
You wanted to work in a kitchen,
this is what working
in a kitchen is, okay?
We don't throw shit out.
Yeah, I wanted to come
and cook, not clean it!
Pick it out of the garbage!
No! I cleaned your
whole stupid truck!
Why are you so mean to me?
Hey, I can't get a
hold of your mom.
But you... you... the truck...
The truck looks great.
You did a great job.
I'm sorry I was mean.
That wasn't right of me.
I gotta pick up some
equipment for the truck.
You wanna come with me and
help me pick out a stove
till morn calls back?
Fine.
All right.
Let's go.
You know what this is?
French fries?
That's right, a fryer.
This is the one we
need right here.
Come on, let's go.
Double convection
oven underneath.
It's a real workhorse,
sixty inches.
I think we could fit them on
the truck. What do you think?
Let's get it.
Let's get this one.
Good. Done.
This is the... ah,
here's what we need.
This is the thing I was
looking for. Right there.
A George Foreman Grill?
That's not a George
Foreman grill. It's called
a Plancha. We make Cuban
sandwiches on that.
This is the key to
our entire livelihood.
We need two of these.
Okay.
Looks good. You know
what? Let's also get the
six inch chef's knife
with the plastic handle.
Then you need also the holder.
Yeah, let's get a cover as well.
Okay, you see this, Percy?
That's a chef's knife.
A real chef's knife.
It's not a toy. You understand?
This thing's sharp.
It can send you to the hospital
if you're not careful.
I'm gonna teach you
how to use this thing.
But a chef's knife, it belongs
to the chef, not to the kitchen.
So it's your responsibility
to keep it sharp, clean,
not to lose it.
Can you handle that?
Yes.
This is a good knife.
It'll last you a long time
if you take care of it.
Don't lose it.
I won't.
Thank you.
You earned it.
How are we gonna
get it in the truck?
Marvin said that we could use
some of his guys to help out.
Hey, guys!
Hello. I'm Carl.
This is my truck.
I-I need some help
moving this equipment in.
Marvin said that you
guys might help me.
I got it.
Mind if I borrow this?
Get to the top floor.
Maybe a little higher?
The hard part was getting
it over to the truck and
now we just have to tip.
If I can get one end up
on the... on the tailgate.
Okay.
Oh, hey, hey don't do that.
Don't... you're gonna
rupture something, man.
- Hey.
- Martin!
Hey, killer, what's up?
How you doing,
little gangster, huh?
What the hell you doing here?
I-I warned you man. I warned
you. If you went and got another
gig, I was drop everything to
be your line cook, didn't I?
This is a food truck.
You're a Sous-chef now.
So? Food trucks don't
need a Sous-chef?
Okay, fine. You're hired.
It pays nothing.
I'll take it. Nice! You're
not gonna scare me, buddy.
- Thank you so much.
- Good to see you, buddy.
What'd you... you must have
just jumped on a plane as soon
as we got off the phone.
Dude, I was so jealous.
When I heard your voice, I was
like, that's what I want to do.
I'm so happy you're here.
Me too, man.
We're trying to get
this up on the truck.
Yeah?
I need, ah, some sort of
like lever and fulcrum.
Come on, everybody,
everybody together. Come on.
- Holy shi...
- No, we can't do this.
No way, not without one
of us hurting ourselves.
No, no, no, no, no, don't. Stop.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Carl, easy.
Wow. It's good
to know Spanish.
You gotta, man.
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.
Okay, good. Fryer next?
No, no, forget the
freaking fryer, man.
I- I'm gonna fill up the propane
tanks, you go to the market,
get Cerveza, not beer.
I can't go to the market. We
still gotta hook up the fryer,
we gotta get rid of
the steam pit. How about...
No, baby, by the time
you get back, I'm gonna
have this all spotless
and cleaned up for you.
I got a lot of marinating to do.
I promised these people
the best sandwich of
their lives. Come on.
- Okay. Good. 80...
- Get me the mojo.
Okay, so what do you need?
Oranges, onion, garlic.
That's right, why don't we
juice it up a little bit, huh?
Tomatillo. Chiles, Cilantro.
Get out. Now get out,
get the hell out of here.
Let's go.
Okay, look, the key is you
gotta look for ingredients
and then that gives you
ideas of what to cook.
Like this is yucca, right? Get
some of that. Those look great.
See that? And ah, come here.
You know what this is?
Uh, bananas?
That's called a plantain.
Platanos.
These are maduros.
Feel how soft?
- Mm-hmm.
- That's the sweet kind.
But we want the green ones.
Here, hang on to this.
This is what you
make tostones with.
That's Martin's favorite.
- I got it.
- You got it?
- I got it.
- Too much?
- Mm-mm. I got it.
- Okay.
Watch out for tarantulas.
Come on.
What?
Ah, that's good.
Ah, look at that.
Ah, yeah, my masterpiece, baby.
That's beautiful.
Miami, I am back. Pow.
Nice, all right, let's try...
You could have just
bought this at the store.
I think they sold it there.
You sure that's your son, man?
I don't know.
You'd better get
a paternity test.
Ooh, look at...
Look at that.
It looks incred...
Take a look at that.
Can I have some?
Oh, Martin.
Please, just give me some.
It's not from the store.
You might not like it.
It's fatty, but not
heavy, you know?
I don't care.
Guys, give it to me.
No, no, you don't
want any of this, man.
Yes, I do.
You're probably a vegan anyhow.
You can't eat this.
- It's not from the store.
- I'm not vegan.
Oh my"
Martin, come on. Mart...
Martin, can I have some?
Wait, wait, wait, man.
Hold on a second.
Come on.
Can I give him a piece, Martin?
Nah, man, he's not... All
right, let me think about it.
Just a little piece. Just a
little piece. Let's see.
Pretty good.
Pretty good? Come on!
Better than the store?
Just one more.
Just one more.
That's the best shit you ever
had in your life, come on, man.
Oh, give me another one.
If you're gonna give him some,
give me some. Don't be cheap.
No, no, no, no,
I-l want some more.
You know what?
Let's make some sandwiches.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Let's get...
Let's get to it.
Hey, little man, is
the plancha red hot? Huh?
Me?
No, I'm talking to the grill.
Yeah, you.
Do I touch it'?
Well, what do you think?
No.
That's right, no, genius.
Hey, look.
Look. Come over here, look.
See this water?
Mm-hmm.
Bang. Is it hot?
Yes.
Tell him it's hot.
It's hot.
Okay. Is it hot as
your daddy's underwear?
Now watch, come over here.
Here we go, papi.
Perfect. Perfecto. Perfecto.
Now watch me.
Watch what I'm doing.
Two slices of ham,
three of pork.
Now the maestro.
Two slices of cheese.
One, two.
Two pickles.
Can I do pickles?
Big pickles. Nice.
One, two. Now watch this.
Take this.
Mustard from end to end.
Okay.
You go side to side,
not forward and back.
Now, this is the
most important part.
This is what makes it a Cubano.
Okay.
Take the butter.
See that? On top.
Yeah.
Take a little bit.
Butter the grill.
In. Just like
that. Now watch.
I want you to watch for
the bread to get golden.
I want you watch for
the cheese to melt.
Okay.
When that cheese is melted and
that bread's golden, but not
burnt, you call me, you tell me
it's done and we'll check, okay?
Okay.
Keep an eye on it.
I want you to watch everything
everybody's doing because
when we're hopping, you're
gonna have to jump in
on the line and help out.
Okay.
I think it's done.
You think it's done?
Ah, look at that.
Now, you see how golden that is?
That's how you want
it to be every time.
You gotta be like a robot
when you're on a line.
Nice job. You're the
shit, baby, you're the shit.
Okay?
Mmm.
Three equal pieces.
Let's see what we got.
All right, here we go.
Hot.
Ha, let me see.
Look at that cheese.
Oh my God, man.
This is the shit.
This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
It's incredible.
This is empingao.
- Mmm.
- Empingao.
Empingao, man.
So, is it good?
It's amazing.
Then I guess we're open.
Hey!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
We're open?
I didn't get to
finish my sandwich.
Here you go.
Here you go.
What do I do?
Cut the bread.
There's Cerveza down there.
Little man, little man,
go get some hazelnuts.
Give me some more ham.
Hey, Jefe, this sound
system sounds like ass.
But hey, I got a cousin who
knows a guy who'll hook us with
all our musical necessities.
Yeah my credit cards are maxed
out and we're not charging for
food yet, so we're gonna have
to wait on the sound system.
Yeah, but you look
happy, baby, don't you?
So happy. So happy.
Yeah, that's what champing it.
Uh-huh.
I got one.
Whoa, whoa whoa,
whoa. That's burnt.
So? They're not
paying for it.
Come with me.
Get off the truck.
You got this?
Yeah, I got it.
I got it. You get down.
Slow down for a second.
Is this boring to you?
No, I like it.
Yeah, well, I love it.
Everything that's good that's
happening to me in my
life came because of that.
I might not do everything
great in my life, okay?
I'm not perfect.
I'm not the best husband
and I'm sorry if I
wasn't the best father.
But I'm good at this.
And I wanna share this with you.
I want to teach
you what I learned.
I get to touch people's
lives with what I do.
And it keeps me
going and I love it.
And I think if you give it a
shot, you might love it too.
Yes, Chef
Now, should have
served that sandwich?
No, Chef.
That's my son.
Get back in there.
We got some hungry people.
He's ready to cook.
We did good, man.
We did good.
We got something here.
I say we stick with
just the traditional menu.
We'll get some yucca
fries, we got the fryer.
That's classic. You
want another beer, boss?
- No, I'm good.
- All right.
Here you go, little man.
You sure?
Is this beer?
No, of course not.
I would never hand you beer.
That's Cervesa.
I'm ten, I can't have beer.
You're not ten.
You're kitchen staff.
Kitchen staff
doesn't have an age.
Dad?
You can have a sip.
Huh?
Like piss, right?
Worse.
You remember that when your
friends offer you a beer.
Ugh.
I figure we go to South
Beach, stake out the truck
a little bit, get
the menu straight.
Then after we're really
confident, we got something
good, then we drive back to L.A.
And hit... hit a few
extra cities on the way?
Why not?
Can I come?
- Can you come?
- Come where?
On the trip.
This isn't a trip. We're just
driving the truck back. You're
flying first class with Mommy
with all the divorce money.
Yeah, but you're
stopping in cities.
Yeah, but you got school.
I'm on break.
I don't know.
Martin, I like your mojo.
Hey, hey, don't work me.
- You're working Martin?
- Working me like that.
He's ice cold.
He knows my soft spot though.
- He likes mojo.
- He got me, man.
We'll talk to your mom.
We'll see what she says.
I already did.
She's cool with it.
Look at that.
He's not...
He's got a... he's 10,
he's got a phone.
Good for you, good for you, man.
Get things done.
Why not?
Why not? Bring him along.
So I'm going?
Yeah.
Yeah, you can come.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Go by the, uh, backhoe.
You want me to
take a poop over there?
Hey, Carl, Carl, check it out.
I'll drop you guys off at the
hotel and in the morning you go
get the rest of the ingredients,
stock up on some stuff and I'll
put a fresh coat
of paint on this.
Do-don't bother painting. We'll
paint it when we get back.
It looks fine like this.
Please. No. No, no, man. This is
on me. My cousin knows a guy.
I'm gonna hook it up.
All right?
Okay.
Who's hungry? Huh?
If you change your mind, you
call me and I'll go
get you anywhere.
Come on,
let's sell sandwiches, baby!
Okay, call me.
Come on, buddy.
Cuidado!
Call me.
I Will.
All right, buddy, I need
you to get me a crowd.
- Yes, Chef.
- All right.
You know it. Mira, mira, papi
cholo, mami chola, step right

Come on, don't be afraid.
Step up! If you need it more
authentic, you can

We got four Cubano all day.
Four Cubano all day.
Hey, this one's not ready, okay?
I'm buttering that one.
I got it, I got it.
Crap.
Hey, I burned my finger.

going or you wanna stop?
I wanna keep going.
Okay, keep going, keep going.
Go, little man.
Help him with that banana
ketchup and the yucca fries.
Go with the chile,

Good job. I'll be with you. Hold
on one second, it's coming.
Is that enough?
Perfect. Here you go.
How's the yucca frita?
It's perfect.
Step aside, step aside.
Thank you.
Who's in charge here?
Um, um, me.
What do you need, sir?
Uh-I need to talk to
you on the side here.
- Okay.
- On the side, please.

Okay, uh, I got... I got it.

Relax, relax.
Keep it down. Keep it down.
Hang on, guys. Come on.
Hang on, hang on.
Hang on, hang on.
I need to see a permit.
A permit, yeah, we
got... we got it.
It should be good?
Yeah, permit's good.
You're just not good
to sell here right now.
Okay, all right. Thank you sir.
So just what?
Like a half mile down the road?
Yeah. As long as you're not
here on South Beach you're okay.
Okay no problem.
Sorry about that.
Hey, uh... Aren't you
the Lava Cake guy?
Uh, yeah, from,
uh, the internet.
Yeah. My kid and
I saw you on Tosh-point-Oh.
You were hilarious.
Thanks.
Okay, great.
That was hilarious.
Okay.
Hey, uh, can I get a quick
picture with you for my kid?
For, uh, my kid.
Sure. Yeah.
Hey, hey, you know
how to work this?
Hey, Martin, help me out.
Uh-What is that,
a flat screen TV?
Hold on a second, let me... let
me unlock it for you real quick.
Hang on, we're gonna... we're
gonna move it down the road.
It's hard to use
other people's technology.
It's a big one. Hey, arm
around you. Is that good?
Yeah. Yeah.
All right, how
do I... what do I press?
Just touch the... tap-tap
the screen first. Hold on.
Let me make sure
it's not on video.
It's on a... Yeah, it's on. And
then put on camera. There we go.
All right.
Get together.
You have to tap the... tap
the center of the screen.
When you see a box, make sure
the box is around our head.
Oh-okay.
So whatever you're
shooting is in the box.
Just take the fucking picture.
All right. I got it,
I got it, I got it. There we go.
Thanks. Let's take the...
Oh, and your your finger's

Oh. Sorry, sorry!
Good, great.

Thank you.
Thank you officer.
Hey, uh, can I just

Uh, o-on the truck?
That'd be great, yeah.

- Okay.
Can I take one pressing
a sandwich or something?
Got it.
Good? Okay.
Good? All right.
Hey, uh, can we do one more
where, uh-with Lady and the
Tramp. You know, I'm biting
one end, I'm biting the other?
Come on, you can do this.
Okay.
You got it?
Go!
I think I missed the exit.
Ow!
What the hell are you doing?
You sending pictures to Mom?
I'm posting a Vine.
A Vine, what's a Vine?
It's a video. Look.
Oh, hey! Hey, come on, man!
Get that out of my face.
- Seriously.
- Christ.
It's only six seconds.
Who'd make a video six seconds?
A six second video.
Can you believe this generation?
Unbelievable, man.
Little attention, ADHD.
ADHD is right.
That's nothing.
I've also been
shooting these videos,
one second every day.
One second videos?
Now you're joking with me.
No. You edit them all together.
One second of every day.
And then you cut them together
and watch it. It's cool.
Okay, enough
with the virtual world.
How about something real. Who
wants to stop at Disney World?
Oh, yeah, I do.
Disney World?
That's real?
We shouldn't stop till
we hit New Orleans.
Hey, hey, that is your son.
That's my boy. A kid would
rather go to New Orleans
than Disney World.
Now I've seen everything.
I can't wait to try
my first Beignet.
Every other person you
say New Orleans to thinks Jazz
and Voodoo.
Your kid thinks donuts.
Yeah, I know.
I like that.
All right, New Orleans.
Ohh!
Hey. What are you doing?
Dude, I'm putting
a little cornstarch on
my werewolves, man.
It's too humid down here.
Dad.
Dad. Wake up.
What?
Martin's putting
cornstarch on his balls.
You putting cornstarch
on your balls?
Yes, sir.
Let me get some?
Want some?
Here.
It's like baby powder.
Put it on your nuts.
It's nice, right?
Nice.
What's good is in the morning
you could dip your nuts in
oil and make hush puppies.
All right, backing up.
Here we come, baby-cakes.
Nice driving skills, huh?
I'm getting the
hang of this thing.
I'm telling ya.
All right, look, I'm gonna
take my kid for a walk.
Oh, nice. I get
promoted to Sous-chef,
but I gotta do
all the hard work?
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
Where are we, Bourbon Street?
Nah, this is Frenchman Street.
Bourbon's for tourists.
We're in the Marigny.
Come with me.
Where we going?
Just come.
Come on, French Quarter.
We're going to Café Du Monde.
You ever heard of Cafe Du Monde?
Is this the Beignet place?
You ready?
We drove a long way for these.
Here we go.
Eat it slow.
You're never gonna have your
first Beignet ever again.
Pretty cool.
It's cool, right?
You like it?
Mm-hmm.
They don't taste like this
anywhere else in the world.
So what else you gotta buy?
Nothing.
Not anything for work?
Nope.
Really?
Nah. Just wanted to get
some Beignets with you.
Cool.
I like New Orleans.
I like New Orleans too.
Somebody ate my body.
I didn't brush my teeth.
This is what happens to you when
you don't brush your teeth.
Dude, dude, where were you, man?
What? I went shopping.
You went shopping? I called you,
man. I texted you.
- We got Beignets.
- Where the hell were you?
I've been calling you
for the last half hour.
Why didn't you pick
up your phone, man?
My phone was on vibrate.
Chill out. What's the big deal?
I'll help you. I'm sorry.
Chill out. Take a look.
Just take a look. Take a look.
Please take a look.
- Is that for us?
- That's for us.
That whole line's for us?
Can you believe that?
Oh my God.
All right, so-I guess
we gotta cook some food.
We gotta cook some food.
All right, so you
good with prep?
- Yes, sir.
- We're gonna get through this.
- You ready?
- I'm ready, boss.
- Okay. Buy me five minutes.
- Yes, sir.
Could you just
give us five minutes, please?
Five minutes. We'll be right
there in five more minutes.
That's all I'm asking.
Everything... Plancha's...
Everything's hot.
Oil's hot.
You got everything ready.
- Yes, sir.
- You are a super star.
- You are a super star.
- Thank you, sir.
And how'd you get that crowd?
You got a huge crowd outside.
I didn't get the crowd.
I just came back from shopping.
There was this long line.
I thought it was a mistake.
I tweeted it.
You what?
What'd you do?
I tweeted the picture on your
account and then geotagged it.
Look.
Wait, man, wha... you did...
You did what? You geo...
I tagged it so they
can mark us on their maps.
Look-look at those pictures.
How'd you... what... this
picture's from here.
Mm-hmm.
How'd you get those
pictures from here?
When I was going
to Café Du Monde.
- And you put it online?
- Mm-hmm.
You're a genius, kid.
You're the reason
everybody's here.
You know that?
You're my new head of marketing.
Thank you.
All right so, uh-I'm gonna
hit the chalkboard. You walk
him through the prep on the po"
boys and get the plancha going.
Yes, Chef.
Yes, Chef. Jefecito.
You gotta butter the
plancha, son, all right?
I got this.
Percy, look. Whoo!
Yes, sir.
Single file, y'all.
Right here.
Oh-eight?
Here you go, thank
you very much.
Napkins are down there.
Another Beignet, coming up.
Hang on a second.
Number seven.
Here you go, two more.
Cubano coming up.
Hang on, one second. He's my
kid. He's just learning.
He put you on the Twitter?
That's my kid.
He did all that.
More Beignets.
How's that... how's
that po' boy coming?
It's coming up with shrimp.
All right?
It's worth the wait, I promise.
Jefe, Jefe,
it says sold out, man.
We should be good.
I think there'll hold for us.
Hey Benji. We got
here as fast as we could.
Yeah. Ooh,
hopefully we're still good.
You got anything for me?
Gotta check with the man.
He'll be in the back.
- All right. Okay, thanks.
- What's up, killer.
- Hey, Aaron.
- What's up, Carl?
- How you doing?
- How you doing?
Driving all night. Doing good.
You still got the stuff?
- Let's do it.
- Oh. He's got the stuff.
What is this place?
This is... this is
Texas OG barbeque.
These guys gotta stay
up all night and
stoke those fires low and slow.
Ah, man, that's gorgeous.
So how many can I get?
I guess four.
I'll take it.
All right.
Ooohh! Nice.
Ah, yeah.
Yeah, ah, here we go.
Mmm!
Oh, man.
Mmm. We should get some sliders.
We should do sliders, man.
We get Kings Hawaiian bread,
pickle, barbeque sauce...
What if we swapped this
out for the pork in the media
noche, what do you
think about that?
We swap this for
the pork shoulder?
Uh-huh.
Make like an Austin Midnight.
Sounds hot. How about that?
I like that. That is hot, baby.
Let me get one more of these.
You should check this out.
Just let me cut right through.
Mm-mmm. Save it, dog.
I know, we're gonna save it.
Come on, you're
using it all up, man.
Okay, you get half.
I'll give you half.
Look at how much more we have.
You know you can't eat your
own supply. Come on, man.
This is good. Put it...
Put it away after this.
Six sliders all day.
Sixty-nine's coming up.
Media noche, Texas.
Ooh, this is gonna be murdered.
You got that three
media noches coming up?
All right.
Order sixty-five and sixty-six.
I got po' boy right here.
One sec.
You got the transfer pan?
Cubano. Thank you, good. Hey,
your phone's ringing, Percy.
Sorry.
Hey, Morn.
Where are you?
I'm in Austin.
Are you okay?
I'm great.
How's your daddy?
Here, talk to him.
Hi, Inez.
Hi, do you want me
to come pick him up'?
No, you're a
thousand miles away.
It's okay. I can go get on a
plane and-and-and pick him up.
No it's fine.
He's doing great.
I miss him. I want you
to come home. I love him.
He's fine. He's
got a couple of burns and
two stitches from
a paring knife.
Please, I'm serious.
Let me go and pick him up.
You know your son's a cook now?
I'm a line cook.
He's a line cook.
Be careful!
I'll have him home
in time for school.
And-and you, are you okay?
I'm amazing.
Ah, you're
so sexy in that bandana.
I want your big platanos.
Looks here like you guys
are having so much fun.
All right, give me one second.
Did you know your
son could work a grill?
I had beer.
What did he say?
Stop, stop, stop.
He says he misses you.
Ay, tell him I love him.
Dad got me a knife.
He says I love you.
What?
I love you!
I love you too!
Te... tell him I
love you too. Okay?
Bye.
All right, seventy!
Let's use a selfie.
A selfie?
Wait, let me do it
with the flash. Hold on.
Oh, look at that.
E-mail that to me, all right?
Okay.
Mind if I post this?
What is it, another Vine?
No, it's One Second
Every Day video.
Remember? It's the
trip all cut together.
Oh, the little
cuts of the thing.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, just e-mail it to me.
I'm sure it's fine.
Listen, I'm... I, uh... I want to
talk to you about something.
Yeah?
I've had a really good time with
you these last couple of weeks.
Me too.
And you've become
a really good cook.
Thanks, Dad.
Not just for a kid.
I mean, you're really good.
You work really hard.
It's a big deal.
But we're gonna be home soon
and... and we're gonna get back
to our lives and I'm gonna be
really busy with the truck and
you're gonna be really
busy with school.
But I can still work
on the truck, right?
You said I was a good cook.
I'm sorry, Percy. I...
I just don't want you to be
disappointed when things go
back to the way that they were.
I don't want it to
go back to that.
I could work after
school and on weekends.
I just want to be
honest with you, okay?
L... I feel like I've let you
down so much and I didn't
want to blind side you.
But... but the summer's gonna
end and we're not gonna
be doing this anymore. Okay?
Okay.
But we had a lot... a lot
of fun and nobody could take
away from us what we
experienced together, right?
And I feel like I
really got to know you.
All right.
Let's watch... let's
watch the music.
All right, pal.
Here we are.
I mean, nice to be home.
Yup.
See your turtle, see your
mommy, back to your room.
I'm really gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too.
Okay, but you'll stay
with me in two weeks.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
The whole weekend.
Did you post the video yet?
I didn't... I didn't
look at it yet. Sorry.
- Don't forget.
- I won't.
- I'll resend it.
- Okay.
Come on. Mommy misses
you. Go. Go to Mommy.
Hey Dad.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
What's up?
Listen, I was...
I was thinking about what
we were talking about.
Yeah?
And it's gotta be okay with Mom.
Let me just say that first.
What are you talking about?
I could really use
your help on the truck.
You there?
Yeah.
And it's only for the weekends
and after school after
you're done with your
homework and all the money goes
into your college fund.
Okay, does that sound good?
That sounds pretty good.
Mom, dad wants me to
cook on his truck!
No, really!
He's on the phone.
Mom wants to talk to you.
I think it's yes. Hang on.
Order sixteen. sixteen.
Sixteen. Sixteen, here.
Thank you.
Order up, order up.
Next!
Mole, two Cubanos, and
order twenty-one, a slider.
Thank you.
Twenty-one? Thank you.
There you go.
I got yours coming.
Okay, thank you.
There's no food for you here.
Could I speak to the Chef
for just a second, please.
The hell you will.
Can I talk to you?
Next!
- You got it, Martin?
- Yes, sir.
Next.
What exactly are you doing here?
I'm, uh, I'm eating the
food. I'm eating your food.
I thought my food
was needy and cloying.
Well, I-l didn't think
you'd want to serve me so
I sent somebody
else to pick it up.
What happened between us that
really knocked me for a loop.
I mean, you
robbed me of my pride
and my career and my dignity.
And I know people like you,
you-you, you don't usually
care about that kind of thing...
That's not necessarily true.
But you should know,
it hurts people like me.
'Cause we're really trying.
You started a flame war with me.
Are you kidding me?
I buy ink by the barrel, buddy.
What are you doing,
picking a fight with me?
I wouldn't
challenge you to a cook off.
I thought I was sending
you a private message.
I didn't know that.
I thought we were having fun.
It was theater. By the way,
what the fuck were you cooking?
You totally shat the bed, buddy.
How could I back that?
You were one of my early boys.
I had no control over the menu.
Whatever the case, okay?
You seem to be cooking
for yourself again.
Because this shit
is sensational.
I mean, really, really good.
Thank you.
I'm not gonna write about it.
Yeah, I understand.
Because I'd like to back you.
Excuse me?
I want to bankroll
you and I can't write
about anything I have
a vested interest in.
I'm not sure I get
what's going on here.
I sold my website for a whole
lot of money and I've just put
in a bid on a place on Rose.
It's zoned, it's permitted,
you could build it out however
you like. And you can cook
whatever you like. Take your
time, think about it.
I wouldn't blame you for
having a few trust issues,
but I just thought that you
know, you and me burying the
hatchet might be a good story,
reservations out the door.
More importantly, you know, you
just cook your ass off in there.
In the meantime, you just
tweet me wherever you are
and I'll come running. 'Cause
this shit's good, all right?
Delicious!
Delicioso.
Mucho good-o.
Hey, Jefe.
Yeah?
That was a lot of talking
and you not punching him.
So what'd that asshole say, huh?
I-I think that asshole
might be our new partner.
Go, go, go!
