<i>Obviously, working from home,</i>
<i>I'll ask that you
respect my privacy.</i>
<i>That said, what we share in
this room is also private,</i>
and, of course, I will
respect that in turn.
I could just imagine myself
spending a lot of time here,
letting my mind... wander.
So you say you've been
to therapy before?
Yes.
And what brings you back?
Um, wanting to
get my act together.
I got a new job. New therapist.
New prescriptions.
So you're seeing
a psychiatrist as well?
I've been on
medication before too.
And what medication was that?
You know, I also got a new job.
Yes, you said that.
And do you have health
insurance through them?
Oh, God, no, no.
It's a grungy little
coffeehouse downtown.
I'd be lucky to get a paycheck.
Well, you have
several options there.
Money's not an issue.
Oh, you know what,
we can settle at the...
Well.
Perfect.
So no suicidal thoughts?
No thoughts of harming
yourself or others in any way?
No, absolutely not. I checked
"no" on all that stuff.
Well, is there anything
in particular
that prompted you
to return to therapy?
My brother's back in town.
He's been gone for a long time.
Well, how long is a long time?
Fifteen, 16 years.
Oh.
So it's not
a simple relationship?
Relationships
with actors never are.
So your brother's an actor.
Would I know him?
If you ever meet him,
don't ask him that.
Okay.
The truth is, he's one of the
great talents of his generation.
He's like that guy you see and
you go, "Oh, shit, that guy."
Okay, so then
he's very successful?
He's one of the great
talents of his generation.
He's completely unrecognizable
from role to role.
But what you just said
made him seem...
It can be gradual.
What can be gradual?
Recognizing him.
Do you watch a lot
of television?
No, I don't. Sorry.
Well, hi there, Emily.
Hey, Abigail.
I wasn't sure if I should
expect you after the last time.
You're the first one here.
Come in, come in.
I wanted to speak
with you privately.
Oh.
I think I need to
quit the book club.
<i>Sweetie,
is that really necessary?</i>
<i>I think so.</i>
I don't think Sela meant
to attack you personally.
My taste is not
that incredibly obscure.
Of course not.
Alice Munro is not obscure.
<i>It's just someone
Sela's not familiar with.</i>
<i>You're old.</i>
I mean, collectively...
and I'm the youngest one
in the group.
I feel that I am having trouble...
relating.
<i>I just thought that it was the least
I could do to tell you in person.</i>
Put yourself in my shoes.
<i>I had your back.</i>
<i>You'll never know everything
I did for you.</i>
<i>And I'm grateful for that.</i>
<i>So why can't you do
this one simple thing for me?</i>
<i>Because this isn't about us.</i>
<i>This is about a city that's broken
and needs to be put back together.</i>
<i>You never cease
to amaze me, Nate.</i>
<i>We both want the same thing.
Justice.</i>
<i>No, you want to save the world.</i>
<i>I'm too selfish for that.</i>
<i>So please don't call me anymore, at
2:00 in the morning or otherwise.</i>
<i>Monica,
let's finish what we started.</i>
Well, I'll be.
Anthony. Hey, sweetheart.
Hey.
Oh. Oh! Wow. Wow.
This is not where I would
have expected to find you.
Well, according to my physician,
it's time to get the old
ticker in tune. Ah.
And an ex of mine always had good
things to say about these trails.
Ah. Yeah, they're
a great place to be alone.
Yeah.
So, what mile are you on?
Oh, I'm just starting.
Well, I'm afraid it's not for me.
Unfortunately. Sorry.
No, no. Why are you apologizing?
Right. That's your thing, right?
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Hey, I'd like to
take you to dinner.
Anthony. No, I'm serious.
Just as friends.
Really?
Really.
Okay.
Okay, why not?
Excellent. Good.
I'll-I'll call you.
And now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go back to my desk.
Okay.
Okay. All right.
Oh, hey...
Okay. Yeah.
All right.
Josh?
Josh?
Mmm.
What are you doing?
Nothing, really.
I mean, it's slow. Is there...
Should I be doing something?
We're low on milk.
Yes.
Do you want me to use less?
No, I'd like you to go get some.
Sh...
Josh! Josh, my man!
Josh, wait up!
You got a smoke?
Uh, I don't smoke. I told you that
yesterday and the day before.
Damn.
I gotta make friends
with more smokers.
Thing's gettin' real
expensive these days.
I wish I could help.
How about you loan me $10?
What did you do with the $10
I gave you yesterday?
You didn't give me no $10.
I didn't? No.
You said you weren't giving
me money for cigarettes.
Then why are you asking me
for money again today?
I'm starving.
I-I need to get
something to eat.
Well, your lead-in
was all wrong.
Ah!
Fine.
Here.
But if you spend this money
on anything other than food,
I will be eternally heartbroken.
And I'll probably kill myself.
I don't need all that
on my conscience.
Are you hungry or not?
Yes. I'm hungry.
Then take it.
But no cigarettes. Or Heroin.
Ten dollars ain't gonna
get me much heroin, now, is it?
I wouldn't know.
You seen your brother?
What?
You've seen your brother yet?
You were looking for
him, weren't you?
Yeah. I was, but...
It might just be a rumor.
It might not even be true.
I heard it from some chick
I went to middle school with.
She said she ran into him
and they spoke,
and he said that he was only going
to be around for a little while.
But how long is a little while?
That's the question.
I have no idea.
How you reckon
you're gonna find him?
Well, what's his name again?
Craig.
How're you gonna
track Craig down?
Craig knows where I am.
Damn right.
Damn right
he knows where you are.
Holy shit, dude.
Holy shit.
<i>My man.</i>
You're unbelievable.
You really are.
I spent months on this one.
Lucille.
Bag lady.
Had to get every last detail.
This is your best work by
far, without question.
This one was all for you.
I knew you'd appreciate it.
If I'm being honest though,
I do sort of wonder why
you wouldn't come to me as
yourself if you're really back.
This is what I do, Josh.
Honestly, I don't even think
I'd recognize you at this point.
It's been forever.
Josh, you know
exactly what I look like.
If I was just myself...
I wouldn't know what to say.
Josh, seriously?
You've been gone
almost half an hour.
Yeah, um, all right.
Hey.
You okay?
No, no, no, no.
There go three douchebags.
Josh!
Okay. Yeah.
Hi.
I almost called you Dr. Milburton,
but you're not a doctor, are you?
No.
I'm a licensed
clinical social worker.
Licensed is good. Mm.
Well, I'm glad we could
see each other today,
because you seem
a little on edge.
But that said, I won't always be able
to accommodate last-minute calls.
I had a cancellation today.
Are you all right?
I should be asking you that.
Why is that?
You look tired.
Why did you
want to see me today?
Did you see your brother?
Yes.
And how was that?
It's hard to say.
Was it a planned meeting?
No.
So you just bumped into him,
like, on the street, or...
Yeah, sort of.
Did you try to engage him?
Why aren't you sleeping?
Do you know what you should try?
Watching television.
Have you seen <i>South Street Law,</i>
starring Craig Lewis Norman?
Uh, I might have. I'm not sure.
I have.
All 12 seasons more than once.
The first three seasons
actually aren't that bad.
Is Craig Lewis Norman
your brother?
It's not his best work.
It's paycheck shit, you know.
There's no craft to it.
But you can get
a great look at him.
Well, if you were
to see Craig again,
would you want to
engage with him?
Right when he booked the gig,
the<i> South Street Law</i> pilot,
it was a really rough time
for my parents.
They had this one kid, Craig,
who lived clear on the
other side of the country,
who didn't seem like
he was ever coming back.
And this other kid
who nobody knew
if he was going to have to wear
Velcro shoes his whole life.
I don't understand.
I have to tell you something.
I have a condition.
I have since I was 19.
What condition is that?
It doesn't have a name.
Or at least all the conditions that
do have names aren't a great match.
And the medication
that you've been prescribed,
is that specifically
to treat this condition?
Sometimes it is, yeah.
And what was the diagnosis
when you were 19?
I do perfectly fine at life.
We all have our good days
and our bad days, right?
Mm-hmm. But you
must want help, right?
Otherwise,
you wouldn't come to me.
How have your parents been
handling things more recently?
My parents are both dead.
Could I speak...
Could I speak with Craig?
No.
Why not?
Because I don't have
his phone number.
But he has some way
of reaching you?
He sent me money.
Every month.
For...
I don't even remember.
Emily.
Hi, Don. I hope
you're not too busy.
I should have called first.
I-I know.
You look well.
Thank you. Same to you.
You're right.
You should have called.
So, what's the story?
I have a new patient.
A challenging patient?
I can't tell if he's bipolar
or if he has some sort
of dissociative disorder...
Does he experience
bouts of mania?
I don't know.
Do you find him
difficult to reach?
Does his grasp on reality seem
looser than it should be?
Is he paranoid?
I can't really tell yet.
Then what makes you think he has
one of these 64-cent conditions?
Because he told me.
More or less.
Well, there are records somewhere.
Who referred him?
The Internet. He's paying cash.
Oh, God.
He may be dysfunctional
in other ways,
but if he's paying you cash to
treat him for schizophrenia,
then he's certainly
not schizophrenic.
I didn't say
that he's schizophrenic.
I wish I could be more helpful.
He has a brother.
Oh, does he?
Why don't you publish
a paper on him then?
Look, I'm really quite busy.
You told me
I could always come to you.
But I didn't mean it.
You're not very good at
reading people, are you?
It hurts me to see you.
Can you understand?
You called me a slut.
And yet here you are.

Okay.
Josh?
Against my better judgment,
I am actually leaving.
You got that thing.
It's my cousin's band.
That sounds fun.
You remember
how to lock up, right?
I'll check in after the show.
- Excuse me?
- Oh!
Oh, sorry. Uh, is this
71 East Willow Street?
I'm looking for
Dr. Emily Milburton.
Oh, it's you. You look just
like your picture online.
It's a great picture,
by the way.
Sorry, I'm Craig Norman.
Joshua Norman's brother.
Yeah. I know. I mean...
Yes. I can see a...
a familiarity in the eyes.
Huh.
What, to Josh? Really?
I don't think
we look anything alike.
I'm not a doctor.
Sorry, what?
I'm a therapist,
but I'm not a doctor.
Oh. Okay. Are you allowed to...
tell me if you're seeing
my brother as a patient?
Is that illegal?
Can you tell me that?
No, no, that's not illegal. Yeah.
Um, yes, Josh is my patient.
Wow, who's this asshole?
Okay, that's my personal phone.
Can you...
Hold on, just a one second.
Hey, now you have my number.
Sorry, that wasn't really fair.
What do you want, exactly?
It's late, and, um,
this is v-very unusual.
Ah, sorry, yes, you're
right, this is, uh...
unusual. Um.
But since it appears that
your plans for tomorrow night
have been canceled...
would you like to have dinner
with me tomorrow night instead?
We could go to Caproni's.
I haven't been there
since... prom.
Uh, what do you think? 8:00?
Yeah. 8:00 should work...
Great. Okay.
I will see you there.
Um... oh.
Uh, if I wanted to
get back to 22?
Um, you're driving?
Walking. I thought
I would give that a try.
Okay. Um, well,
you're gonna take a right
out of the driveway,
and then a left on Glen Rock,
and you'll follow that until it
becomes Springfield Highway,
and then you'll hit 22
in about half a mile.
Okay, and so a right
and then a left?
Mm-hmm. And I'm good.
Yes.
Okay.
Got it. See you tomorrow.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
What were you watching?
I'm sorry. Was I being too loud?
No. I'm just... curious.
It's a video of a guy getting
kicked in his balls by a donkey.
I just wanted to be sure
it wasn't, um,
you know, some kind of
official business.
<i>122-B on Ironwood Drive.
Any available units.</i>
<i>Repeat, 122-B in progress.</i>
Copy that. This is Davenham.
I'll check it out.
Hey.
You know what that is? A 122-B?
It means there's
a verifiable likelihood
that someone will steal
two youth-sized bikes
for no other purpose
than to race them.
Now,
who do you think
would do such a thing?
Come on, bud.
We've got some bikes to steal.
I really don't understand how
you had time for this one.
I studied clowning in Europe.
I'm not sure
I see the connection.
Total body control, baby.
I can assume a new character
with just a few
carefully selected movements.
And a ridiculous fake goatee.
Hey! The goatee is real.
Yeah, but you know that
I really hate cops, Craig.
But I'm not really a cop, am I?
What if I have a flashback
and I start tweaking out?
Then I guess we would call it my
most convincing performance to date.
But it's all an illusion, Josh.
You know that.
Come on, man. You used to
beg to hang out with me.
What's the problem?
Brother, I cannot do this alone.
Come on. This is it.
Come on, Josh!
My man! On the run!
Whoo! Whoo! That's what
I'm talking about.
We're the police, baby!
Come on, man!

Wait. Craig, I don't

Come on! Get off that bike!
Hey. It's you.
Hey. Uh... I work here.
Oh, I'm glad somebody does. I've
been sitting here for 30 minutes.
You okay?
You're breathing really hard.
Were you running?
No. I mean,
literally, yes, but...
Not, like, out for a run.
Oh.
What about you?
What brought you out
this evening?
Well...
I like to walk around
at night, then...
thought I might have a coffee.
I saw this coffee shop.
Okay, yes,
that makes perfect sense.
Do you think you're going
to go walking tomorrow?
I imagine so.
Could I join you?
There's a gas station
at 22 and Springfield.
We could meet there.
I'm Josh, by the way.
Josh.
Hannah.
Hannah.
Do you still... want a coffee?
Nah, it's okay.
See you tomorrow? You bet.
Well, the place
is still standing.
That's certainly a positive.
Uh, look,
I'm going to need you to
close again tomorrow night,
So let's just go over a few...
I quit.
What?
So, um...
Emily, I won't always be able to
accommodate last-minute calls.
This is not
a normal thing for me,
and I am sorry
for interrupting your day.
Oh, um...
You didn't interrupt anything.
Don't worry.
That was a joke.
I'm actually always available to
accommodate last-minute calls.
Have you spoken
to your brother yet?
Why? Have you?
No.
I haven't.
But after our last session,
I was worried about you.
My condition? Well, yeah.
But that's not
what this is about.
Hold... I'm not saying... No.
Um...
I'm not saying that
you wanted to see me
like you have a crush on me.
And I definitely don't
have a crush on you.
You do have a certain way of
presenting yourself, which is...
Okay, I don't think that
you have a crush on me.
Oh.
Mm-mmm.
I wanted to see
if you were okay,
and was worried about you,
but you seem fine.
You really seem fine.
But you could have asked if
I was okay over the phone.
Yeah, well...
sometimes a therapist will...
You have something
important to tell me.
I never said that.
You didn't have to.
So, what is it? What is what?
The important thing.
There is no important thing.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Oh. I don't know.
Have you watched
<i>South Street Law</i> yet?
The first three seasons
are really very strong.
Um...
I'm not gonna charge you.
Ha, ha.
That will be all?
Yeah.
Oh, um...
I quit my job.
Oh. Uh, okay. Do you want to...
No. It's great.
Hello.
Hey.
Do you like my shirt?
Uh, sure.
I got it at a real discount
'cause it was marked irregular.
But sometimes irregular
things can be just fine.
Shall we?
Sorry.
Sorry, it's just, uh...
Just... Let's go. Come on.
No. No, no.
Emily.
Yes.
Have you ever been in a car
that's run out of gas?
No.
Me, neither.
Kind of makes you think, right?
Think what?
All this gas stuff, like this
dependence on foreign oil
and whatever, or oil in general,
it's like, what if they've just
convinced us all that our cars need gas
to run when really they'd
run just fine without it?
That's why no one really gives
a shit if we run out of oil,
because it was useless
to begin with,
and once it's gone,
they'll just wax nostalgic
about the good old days when they could
sell people what's basically mud
like it was gold or something,
which is also pretty
useless, if you ask me.
I don't know if that
all really holds up.
You're right. It's just
something I think about.
Hey...
how's this walk going for you?
So far, so good.
Well, this is great.
I can see why you like this.
Cool.
I-I was a student
at the college.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, that's how
I ended up here.
Born and raised, myself.
I didn't graduate.
Eh, who needs it?
No, it was my choice.
It just kept going
on and on, you know?
No. Um...
I didn't go to college.
Do you have a lot of friends?
Like real friends,
or on Facebook?
Real friends, for sure. No.
I have a lot on Facebook.
So you only have, like...
a few quality real ones?
I guess.
One more quality
than the others?
I wouldn't say that.
What?
I've just...
been worried.
About what?
That you're maybe
some sort of criminal...
who spotted me
for a mark, and...
you need me to kill someone for
you or you'll harvest my organs.
Oh.
Well, I'm not.
Huh. I can't tell you
what a relief that is.
Because when I first saw you, I
thought that this could really work.
I thought maybe
we'd really hit it off.
Wait, so when did you decide that
I wanted to harvest your organs?
I don't remember.
Thank you.
Well, so you're an actor.
Is that right?
Yes.
I'm sorry. I don't
watch very much TV.
That's okay.
That is, however, where I do
the majority of my work.
What's the show?
<i>South Street Law.</i>
Mmm.
If you're interested, it is...
pretty much... everywhere,
I think, at this point.
It's a very big hit, right?
Or was... was a very big hit.
I was very lucky.
Um... but that is all over now.
Well, why is it
that you're back in town?
Josh mentioned that
both of your parents are...
Real estate issues. Really?
I own some property... I was
left some property in town,
when my parents died,
um... and I got an offer
on it out of the blue.
So I wanted to make sure
there were no...
weird issues.
Hm. This time of year,
I would have thought...
Well, I mean,
I'm not kidding myself
about what the property's worth.
I mean...
But I thought for Josh,
you know,
that I would sell it and...
and give the money to Josh.
But you... He says you haven't
seen him in, like, 15 years?
I just... I did wonder how
you knew he was my patient?
Uh, well, I pay his phone bill,
so I did a reverse look-up
on some of the numbers.
Um, I don't usually like to pry,
but, you know, he doesn't
really call that many people,
so I was actually thrilled to find
out that you were a therapist.
But don't you want to be in
contact with him yourself?
He says he doesn't even
have your phone number.
Well, you know... Josh is a
pretty disturbed individual.
I just mean, a piece of
property around here
probably isn't anything to you.
I'm just surprised that you would
come all this way for that.
Um, you know what?
I think I don't want to
talk about Josh anymore.
Well, talk to me
about acting then.

I figured this place was closed.
It is, isn't it?

Maybe it was a light
or something.

want to hang out again?

So,
it's been almost a week.
That's a record for us.
How are you feeling?
Fine.
Good.
Well, I feel like I have to ask,
and you don't have to tell me,
but... have you been taking
your medication?
No.
Why not?
Is that a serious question? Yes.
You do know those drugs
make men grow tits, right?
They're not without risk.
And I don't want to be
lost to the world.
But isn't the point
of therapy and medication
to bring you back into the world?
I have a confession to make.
Okay.
I've been watching
<i>South Street Law.</i>
So?
Craig, huh?
You're right. He's very good.
Do you find him attractive?
Well, I wasn't thinking
of him that way.
Oh. Well, what way were
you thinking of him?
Not that way.
Mm-hmm. I wanted to get a sense
of where you were coming from.
Oh, so you're watching
<i>South Street Law.</i>
Good for you.
I take after our mom.
I wasn't looking
for a resemblance.
Okay, that's bullshit. But fine.
I'm sorry, Josh.
Is something bothering you?
You didn't believe
that I had a famous brother,
that he was a great actor, so
you had to see for yourself.
Well, whether or not I
believe you is not an issue.
So you still don't.
I'm just trying to understand.
There are things I could
tell you about my brother
that you really
wouldn't believe.
Like... Like what?
I was lying when I said I
haven't seen him for 15 years.
I have seen him. He comes to me.
But only in character.
So you see Nate Marcus,
and not Craig Norman?
Sometimes he comes to me as an
old homeless woman. Sometimes...
I mean, Craig took clowning in Europe.
Did you even know that?
He has amazing command
over his body!
So when... when you see
an old homeless woman,
how do you know that it's Craig?
We talk! We talk!
And then what?
Let me ask you a question. Let me
ask you a question. Is it real?
When I see him, when I
talk to him, is it real?
Most of the time,
our perceptions...
Please just answer the question.
I'm not sure that it matters.
You charge for this?
Josh, hold on.
Just... if you want to go now, do
you want to come back tomorrow?
There you are.
Did I tell you where I live?
Yeah, you did.
The downstairs door
was unlocked, so.
Yeah, the downstairs
door is always unlocked.
I don't think the lock
even works.
I thought we were going
to hang out, so I...
Yeah, I thought we were
gonna hang out too.
I've been looking
everywhere for you.
I haven't seen you for days.
I figured you were gone.
Gone? Like, I moved away?
What have you been up to?
I don't know.
Stuff.
What have you been doing?
Have you been out walking?
I tried. It's not as fun alone.
I know. I was just out walking
for hours alone. It sucks.
Right?
Okay, I'll take you
for a walk. Come on.
If you've been walking for hours,
aren't you tired? You want a break?
No. Come on.
Are you thirsty? You want
some water or something?
No.
Can I use your bathroom?
Sorry.
Yeah. You can use my bathroom.
It's nice to see you again.
What?
Nothing.
Since you're here, do you
want to watch TV or something?
I don't usually have people over, um,
but if you wanted to watch something...
So this is where
the magic happens.
Yeah, I should have said.
This space is off-limits.
I hope you can understand.
Did you ever study
clowning in Europe?
Wow, did Josh tell you that,
or did you read that
somewhere on the Internet?
I didn't look you up on the Internet.
Uh-huh.
Well, I did go to Europe
for a little bit,
and clowning was meant to be...
on the agenda.
Um...
It was right before
I split to go to LA.
I was basically looking for any
reason to... drop out of school.
I vaguely remember telling
Josh something about that.
But, no, I never went
to a single class.
I just sort of dicked around Paris
for a little while, then came home.
Hmm. Well, it must
have stuck with him.
Isn't that weird?
You must get that
all the time, like...
people remembering, like,
weird things that...
I mean,
I remember this one time...
vividly...
Josh came with me and a bunch
of friends to the zoo, right?
He was little.
We thought
we'd play a prank on him.
We would run ahead, hide behind
trees, yell his name and...
hide in a tunnel.
He was like eight, and he was
terrified, and he ran away.
And... I remember
being so pissed.
I had to look for him
for, like, 20 minutes.
I could not find him and I
just remember...
being so angry.
And now, obviously,
realizing it was awful,
especially given...
How everything turned out.
Is that normal? To
remember things like that?
Like you said, people hold
onto all sorts of things.
Yeah, I guess.
I was really glad to hear from
you after the other night.
I'm sorry I had to leave. I
had to get back to LA... Mmm.
To test for this
new television show.
Oh? Did you book it or get it or whatever?
Yes. Yes, I did. I did.
Congratulations. That's great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm not going to do it.
Really? No. It's terrible.
I mean, it's terrible.
It's embarrassing.
What about your real estate?
How's that going?
Well, you know, I mean, it's...
as soon as I sell,
the house is toast.
It's just... I mean, I don't even
know what anyone would do with it.
Hold on.
Would this be your childhood
home we're talking about?
Yeah, I mean, the house is
basically falling down.
I mean, not literally but...
I mean, I don't even know...
I mean, you'd have to deal with
the mold, and...
Things are probably for the
best the way they are now.
No.
No what?
Things are not best
the way they are.
They're actually pretty bad.
I don't understand.
For Josh.
Well, I mean,
I'm gonna go soon and then
everything will be back to normal.
You need to see him.
Is that your advice
as his therapist?
As his therapist who's currently
sleeping with his brother?
Yes.
As a therapist, yes.
And he needs much better
care than what I can give him.
Well, maybe I'll stop
paying for it then.
I think Josh hallucinates.
You<i> think</i> he hallucinates?
Yeah, no, he hallucinates.
He-He's schizophrenic.
Or... Or maybe bipolar
or maybe schizoaffective
or maybe all of the above.
I mean, do you have any idea how
long I've been hearing about this
and dealing with this? Craig.
I mean, God, that is...
That is not why I am here.
It's you.
You are what he hallucinates.
Me?
As different characters
that you've played.
What-What are you talking about?
Like Nate Marcus? What?
No, but... like the...
like an old homeless woman?
When would I ever have played
an old homeless woman?
Why don't we go to bed?
Okay, well,
I'll call you before I leave.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about my place.
Don't be.
I want to be able to have you
over and stuff, watch TV, and...
But I...
I just don't really have people over
right now. It's not something that I do.
After my mom died...
She died of breast cancer...
and my dad had a heart attack.
He went first.
It was really sudden.
So that was a bad year.
Anyway, after all that
happened, I would just...
sleep outside...
for, like, weeks at a time.
I would get
so fucking cold sometimes.
But it just kept going on for a
while, like, years, I think, maybe?
I think it was years.
But you know how it is, and then I
moved into my current apartment.
I have to tell you
something about myself.
When I was 19, I w...
I had a psychotic episode.
And I ended up in the
hospital for almost a week.
Most of that in restraints.
You can ask me for more details,
but I honestly don't have them.
You'd have to ask
a doctor or someone.
I've taken
different medications,
had different treatments
of all kinds.
I have a brother.
But he hasn't been around
very much.
Hey, is there anything that you
want to tell me about yourself?
Josh. Josh. Josh...
Hey! Don't listen to them.
Douchebags!
Josh! What did you say?
- Let's make this quick.
- Josh, come back!
Make what quick? Very funny.
Which one of you is it?
Holy shit. What do you
want from me, Craig?
My name's not Craig.
I know what this is.
Jesus, psycho.
Shut up. I know what this is.
Josh!
- I know what this is!
- Josh!
I know you're doing this
to try to mess with me!
I know you're trying to get to me!
I just don't know why.
Back off.
What do you want from me, Craig?
What do you want from me? Ow!
Dude! He deserves it.
Come on, bro.
We gotta get out of here.
No, he deserves it.
Uh, Emily Milburton.
Is everything okay? Are
you looking for someone?
Yeah, I'm looking for Josh Norman.
He's my patient.
I'm the one who called you.
Okay, I want to see Josh.
He had this in his wallet.
I'm sorry. You're his therapist?
Yeah. I'm his therapist.
So I don't need to show you
his rather impressive file?
Who's prescribing
his medications?
I don't know.
The guy has prescriptions
all over the planet.
I mean, I would love to give
him a real painkiller, but...
Yeah, he's not a drug addict.
He has prescriptions
for ziprasidone,
olanzapine, risperidone, but the benzos
are what really have me worried.
He's not taking them.
He's not taking any of them.
Oh. Wonderful. You do realize
he's schizophrenic, right?
Can you step aside please?
- The police are on their way. I don't think it's a good idea.
- Step aside!
Emily.
You're in a hospital, Josh.
You had a-a little
card in your wallet.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, my head hurts really bad.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
The police
want to speak with you.
Hospitals<i> and</i> police.
It's my favorite things.
Well, you were attacked,
and they need
to find out who did it.
Is there a cop there,
right on the other side
of that curtain?
No.
I asked them
to give us some time.
What about the girl?
What girl?
The girl that I was with.
Is she okay?
I don't know. I didn't hear
anything about a girl.
Josh, do you think that it was
Craig who did this to you?
It was three douchebags.
One douchebag in particular.
But I... I don't think
we can rule Craig out.
You just said it was...
I know what I said.
'Kay.
I'm gonna go get the officer.
I've seen Craig...
since he's been back.
Did you sleep with him?
Why...
Why would you ask that?
That's very personal.
Yes, it is.
I, uh...
I'm sorry. I don't make very
good decisions in that way.
I'm sorry.
Why don't you just go?
Where the hell were you?
I'm sorry. What? I...
I've been calling you,
like, all day.
Josh was in the hospital
last night.
He got in a fight.
He got beaten up.
Okay, when exactly
did you call me?
All day. All day
I have been calling you.
I... I was busy.
With what?
It's none of your business.
Well, I had to tell him.
W... That's on you.
Well, he already knew somehow.
Well, I have to leave first
thing tomorrow morning, so...
No. Sorry.
You can't.
I'm a horrible person,
all right?
But you need
to see your brother,
and you need to let him see
that you are real.
How did he react?
When you told him...
we were sleeping together?
He was very upset. Yeah.
I'm pretty sure
he knows I'm real.
Please.
Look, you want to know why
you're not a good therapist?
It's not because
you're a horrible person.
It's because you're alone.
Nothing has any context.
I bet you just sit there
and nod your head
while people cry about their
problems to you, hmm?
Am I right?
I mean, what are you
supposed to say?
Okay then, Debbie,
have a good week.
Oh, Debbie, Debbie. Debbie.
I didn't think
I'd see you again.
I'm not coming back.
You don't need to
find a new time for me.
I understand.
So they never caught
the douchebag.
I'm sure if they had, he would
have just hired a lawyer
and cried "crazy person."
I'm sorry.
But it's not your fault.
I just wanted to make sure
that you're okay.
That's very nice, but I'm fine.
Have you, um... Seen Craig?
No.
I started taking my meds again.
Uh, I don't have
the sweats or the jitters.
And I can still... open my jaw.
Uh, that's a good thing.
And I guess I have more clarity.
Like, I'm not seeing and hearing
things that aren't there.
Well, that's good.
That's very, very good.
Is that what you believe?
Really?
'Cause I miss them, you know?
I really miss those things that
weren't there. Isn't that weird?
I think it's perfectly natural.
I miss certain of them
more than others, I think.
I haven't...
I haven't seen him either.
Of course you haven't.
Well, I don't think I will...
see him again.
Emily, I know that you only
said what you said because
you felt the need to lash out,
and you were angry with me.
What?
And I think that
you're a very lonely person.
I am too.
It's easy for us
to get carried away.
I don't understand.
Emily, you never
slept with my brother.
I'm sorry, Josh.
I am so sorry, but I did.
That's impossible.
Why is that?
Because I am my brother.
I am Craig Norman.
I have been the whole time.
Sorry, I'm just kidding you.
I'm just messing with you.
I'm not Craig Norman.
Wha... No, no, whoa, no.
I was just joking. I was joking.
It was a joke.
No, no, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
How could we possibly
be the same person?
I mean, you must have Googled
him at least, right?
He's famous.
I just...
I can't believe he would come all
this way and not have seen you.
I guess he really
didn't want to.
Craig Lewis Norman?
Yeah. It's me.
It's really you, huh?
Yes.
So, this is
what you look like now.
I hope you're not disappointed.
You look a little
like Nate Marcus,
if I'm being honest.
Ah, well...
Typecasting, I guess.
Emily?
Uh, I made her come.
You sure it wasn't
the other way around?
You can call me anytime, Josh.
Come in. Both of you.
Um...
Do you want some water?
I'll...
I'm okay.
Emily?
Um...
Where's your bathroom?
It's just... Just through there.
Here, let me...
Thanks.
You don't... You don't have to...
It's good to see you, buddy.
It's good to see you're still
in one piece.
A couple of
bruises is all it was.
My schnoz is healed. I could
probably take this off, actually.
They ever catch the guy?
It's just a few douchebags.
What can you do?
Well, I was worried, you know.
I was worried when I heard.
I must have changed my flight
back home five different times.
You staying at the old house?
No. No, I thought
about it when I...
first made plans
to come out here.
But then I saw the place
and I thought, oh, great.
Been trying to make up my mind
what to do with it, you know?
What do you think?
It's your house.
It was left to you.
It wasn't left to me.
Yeah, I know that, Josh,
but I'm asking you.
I mean, you have every right...
Um, I bet I look really, um...
I bet I look
really different than...
what you remember from the
last time you saw me, huh?
Josh, it was seven years ago
when we saw each other last.
Do... Do you not remember that?
No, that's not...
That's not right.
That's definitely not right.
It was 15 or...
It was when dad died.
When dad died,
and I got the call,
and I came here, and Mom was as good
as gone, and no one could find you.
I looked all over for you.
You weren't at the house. The
hospital said you were never there.
And I found you...
living on the street.
Never at the hospital is...
That's not exactly true.
Josh, I could have
put you in an institution.
But I put you here instead.
I thought it would be more manageable
for you than living in the house.
Well, I should go.
- No, it's...
- Yeah, it's okay, Josh.
Josh, yeah, I just...
I-I had to stay away.
What? Before.
I had to.
But I kept you in my thoughts.
And not the money, that's not...
I just...
You know, I keep thinking.
I keep thinking about...
about how I...
You...
I keep thinking about
how I treated you.
Like the day at the zoo.
I think of
you just being so lost
and bewildered and abandoned,
and it just rips my heart out.
So, I'm sorry.
Apology accepted.
Honestly, I...
I remember always having
a great time at the zoo.
What are you going to do now?
Why don't you just stay?
Oh, yeah,
so he says to his boss...
- I had to tell him what I thought.
- Oh, had to?
If I hadn't told him
what I thought, then...
Oh, yeah, that he should,
you know, go... himself.
Then we were going to be stuck in
the same rut for the rest of our lives.
What, you and him?
You and me.
Oh.
You expecting someone?
No.
- Lot of anger.
- What?
I get so goddamn angry, you
know, I don't even know at who.
At who. At whom?
Which is it? At who?
I am just like my father.
He was this exact same way.
All right, I think
we're just about out of time.
