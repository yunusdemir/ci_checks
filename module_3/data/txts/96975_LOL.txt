You'd tell mum, huh ?

Sleep, sweetheard.
I'll write you an excuse.
Mum, I'm begging you, I'm late!
Well, you should have woken up earlier.
I didn't even had the time to take a shover.
It's my clothes!
Stop taking my stuff!
-It's cold!
-Sure it is!
Tomorow, you take the subway, sweetheart!
No way!
Every day it's the same thing!
The same comedy!
It's cool, you see, I figure
I give her a ride at least we'll
tell each other our life,
the things of the world, of the life,..
..philosphy or...
the beauty of nature...
And in fact not at all...
hello? Earth is calling.
You hear me ?
Peekaboo!
There you go.
I figure you have a good reason to be late ?
Well in fact 'mam you're gonna laugh 'cause...
As you see me there, I'm at my best
Well, you see this morning I had a breakfast accident.
I got a Choco Pops
..stuck in the nose.
My mother had to take me to the emergency to...
-And you, I figure it was a Frosties or something ?
-What a face she had!
-Unbeleivable
Well, ciao!
bye
By the way with Arthur did it get better?
So-so
I just wanna tell you that if I was him,
I would never have left you.
Yeah, but you're not him
Yeah, I know...
You know, it's not because
he's my best friend that
I agree on everything he does.
I know...
And...
You, I adore you. Really.
I don't want this to destroy our friendship, Lola.
I adore you too, Maël.
Really.
All right then.
We will go on with some factorization
..by resolving the following equation :..
..(x   1)   (x   3) = 0.
There you go.
You want me to help you to finish it, Charlotte ?
Yes
It' not very complicated, you'll see.
<i>Make love to me, like we do at 16</i>
<i>Make love to me...</i>
<i>..without experience</i>
<i>Make love to me shyly</i>
<i>Like a beautiful evening of adolescence</i>
minus 2!
Voilà!
Does everybody understand?
<i>Make love to me, like we do at 16</i>
May I ?
Huh? yeah, sure. Come on in, it's all right.
We continue with another exercise...
What's wrong with the girl, they're turned on or something ?
It's good for you, no ?
-I'm sorry ?
-It's good for you, no ?
...(x-2)   (x  3)...
"Absolutely fabulous!"

Silence, be quiet!

The first one who opens his mouth...
I send him straight "directly" to the principal.

And where d'ya get what you got under that shirt of yours ?

<i>Shitty ambiance
Arthur is so much of an asshole</i>

<i>In fact now, I don't even give a fuck about him.
I think he's jalous</i>
<i>Of Maël, nonetheless.</i>
<i>Thank God he's there him.
I adore him so much</i>
Can I come to your house tonight?
Well no, not yet
Why is that?
Well not every night. Otherwise I don't see the point
of being divorced
Damn!
<i>Crazy thing!</i>
<i>My father is screwing my mother again
or vice versa.</i>
<i>It's crazy!</i>
You have to repeat again, sweetie
"France is exposed to..."
"the 3 frontages" .
"to the 3 mari..."
"Mari..."
" ...nated frontages"!
So silly! "marinated"!
Don't mock your sister, téo
It's not cool
"3 maritine frontages... which are"
The North Sea, the Medeteranean sea..
..and the Pacif... Atlantic ocean!
What's wrong ?
Why are you looking at me like that ?
Just looking at you, that's all.
TEXT MESSAGE: "Where R U ?"

How you doin' ?
Fine.
Lola do you mind if we meet in front of the school?
I don't want Arthur to see us arriving together.
-Yeah you're right, it's not...
-See ya.
We started at the "Planches" club,
and we finish the night the "Mix" club.
-Seriously?
-I'm exhausted!
I understand.
Well I'm exhausted, too!
Damn, look at her lingerie
She gots it all, this bitch!
Yeah, you're right
But I'd like to her ass, you see!
You'd have to stop eating a kilo of Nutella every night.

-Come on...!
-"No way"!
-You're a douchebag!
Check this out Stéphane, hey Charlotte

..or "Titanic", your underwear?
Stop it, it's my mother! She only buys that.
-Right!
-Right!

I'm thinking my mother she robbed the whole H&M store,
many thongs don't fit her
I can give you some if you want
Yeah, that'd be cool
And you Provence, you're instrested?
Na I don't like thongs, honestly I think it's vulgar.
Got it!

Move your ass, Goddamn it!
Normaly you know all about it...
There, you see it that one ?
Clavel, you need help ?
Paul-Henri, don't fall in love with the ball
Watch it, Arthur!
What's wrong with you ?
He's crazy this guy!
-It's Lola, man, she's a girl!

Listen Lola, I'm at the police headquaters
they just confiscated my car registration document, so please..
..Because it's like that
I'm not Dolto, I don't have to justify
everything to everyone all the time.
Now that's enough!
Oh shit! Come on now...
Shit! Shit!
Fuckin'...
May I help you?
-Are you a cobbler?
-Nop.
That's too bad.
Yep' that's too bad.
Where you going like this ?
Well I don't know I'm gonna take a cab.
'cause the fucking cops impounded my car!
The station, it's.. it's quite far,
you're not gonna cross it like that...
Yeah you're right but...
I'll give you a ride.
That would be great, It's nice of you
Take this.
And you ?
I don't need it.
Be carefull, 'cause they're real..
..real assholes!
Yeah, I know, I know.
See you later.
Oups!
I'm sorry.
Voilà
Thanks a lot
You're welcome. Wait a sec... it often gets stuck
There you go, carefull
And I'm sorry I insulted your collegues.
Oh you know I'm used to it.
Was he goodlooking ?
Yeah, but whatever, I'm not gonna screw a cop
that'd be all I need.
For one night!
Short and sweet...
Na, not my type...
Who, the guy ?
No, the one night stand...
Well, I'm telling you...
If I was divorced,
I'd screw everything that moves...
What'd you do if you were divorced?
Nothing, nothing..
Yes, yes, yes!
I'd get laid by one guy,
every night just like "you" do!
-Who's that, "you"?
-"you"..
-..men.
-Oh us!
The big assholes congregation!
But you can't do what we do, sweetheart!
And why is that ?
-Everything's fine kiddos ?
-It's all right.
By the way ma, I don't know if you knew, but
Julien has a moto.
-So ?
-So I was thinking it could
..help me not being late
-No, no, never!
-Seriously, you got a moto ?
-Dad says it's not dangerous.
I'll take you to Garches Hospital to show you people
in their wheelchair.
Lola, if I ever see you on a moto...
And what are you doing exactly ?
I'm getting some food up in the room
'cause I'm gonna show Julien
some things on the computer.
That's not cool
I laid the table
-OK!
-We'll get down for the desert.
You too should go to Garshes Hospital, she's right you know
Oh! Come on that's not cool...
We just go upstair to watch some stuff
Dad we can, right ?
Yeah
-It's okay, we'll be in peace
-Plus, old people's conversations... you get it
-Well educated, my daughter!
-Well.
-She's very nice, it's the kinda things I appreciate
-It's lovely
-This tall kid huging you...
-The tall kid has ears you know?
-Dady he can't resist
-Mummy, come on, it's all right
You're tiresome
You say yes to everything!
The moto?
-Yes, for the moto, for going upstairs
-All right, let's eat, dinner's ready!
So what do you think ?
Not bat, what is it?
-It's a friend.
-Do you mind if I roll a joint ?
Sure! But I'm gonna close the door...
She smokes Lola ?
Are you nuts ?
Wait... No I don't want it...
That's what you think!
Did she ever see you smoking ?
I try to avoid it...
Julien,..
..he's at war, he hates drugs.
I don't worry about it.
I'm gonna do my surfing training course with the UCPA.
That's nice.
And you, what do plan on doing?
I don't know 'cause dad is screwing mum again.
No!
Yep! Maybe it'll change everything.
And you're happy about it ?
I don't believe in their story anymore.
Not very optimistic!
Tell me sth, Julien...
I wanted to ask you a favor...
hmm ?
Can we have sex ?
No, no
You women, you don't get laid
just like that
You need feelings...
-fee.. what ?
You don't go to prostitutes
Why, do you ?
No but in general, you can't say that
..sexuality is the same for men and women
And what's so different ?
I mean, explain it to me!
I'm guessing I'll be interested
-Yeah me too
-You, I don't talk to you anymore anyway.
Ah come on it's not like I asked you euthanasia
Even if I wanted to, and that's not the case, I couldn't do it
Why ?
I have too much respect for you
Fuck you guys with your respect
Girls!
When we don't respect you, we're assholes
and when we do,
..it fuckin bothers you!
-We've known each other for 8 years
-That's the point Lola
Do I walk around and ask
"hey do you wanna have sex with me" ?
What would you say ?
I'd say 'yes'
-Well I    say   no
-Gotcha
Do it with your boyfriend
-With my boyfriend ?
-It seems more logic!
No I told him I already did it.
He can't know that I lied.
Man! Women really are insane!
Na, we ain't insane!
Look at Lucie, she's living the life
-Damn right she does!
-Yeah!
Since she got seperated,
she met tons of men.
and not even on Meetic.
She fucks whoever she wants
She doesn't get bored with the same
guy with a stincky mouth
Welcome in the 21e century, sweetheart!
-Well Lucie she's a whore, sorry to tell you!
-Come on!
Having lovers doesn't make a woman a whore.
Whatever, I'm the only man here so...
-Poor you!
-And Alain, do you see him sometimes ?
Na, just for the kids.
Just that.
Oh! We saw him with a bitch.
-huh, what ?
-Alain, we saw him with a bitch.
-A blonde.
-We don't know if he was with her...
"we don't know"!
He had his tongue in her mouth
..and his hand on her ass!
What more do you want, Colombo?
What?
Did I do something wrong ?
-Is it a problem for you ?
-No no why ?
It's just that... I don't know...
Do you want some pie ?
Sssssh, take off your shoes
They're sleeping
The stairs are making noise
Like a robber in my own house.
Former home
You don't see other women, do you ?
Who ?
You heard me.
You mean, if I sleep with women
other than you ?
You got it!
Are you nuts or something ?
So you see no other women except me ?
But...
I don't know. To me we're..
..we're together
I don't understand, it's crazy!
Crazy!
Crazy, huh ?
Wait a sec! Shhh!
Yeah mum. I'm at Arthur's right now

Kiss
Gotta go
Man forget it
I have no choice.
Plus Medhi isn't here
That's the point! Medhi doesn't come
And you gotta go after 5 min... Come on
-Don't worry we'll kill it
-We ain't gonna kill nothin man, it's a competition

Music is the only thing they got in life
Me too man, you think I wanna end up

I call you if I can come back.
I'm sorry!
Drives me fuckin crazy...
-There!
-What's your band ?

What's that ?
Pop folk music
And what's that...

Oh yeah, you're a pro at that kinda thing
Don't be jalous!
Don't worry about it
Oh no!
'No Shampoo' live!

I want us to stop fighting for nothing
Nothing ? You have sex with prostitutes!
I'm tired of all this
I won't make more effort, Alain.
You're both the best and the worst thing

Yeah, I know I know
So! here's the brain of a 15 year old boy

The blue area still has to grow until adult age.
Here, it's in contact with some THC
No way it'll happen to you, you ain't got a brain
You shut the fuck up!

Damaged areas will stay damaged for life
which you give that in picture
You see that ?
What ?
"What ?" that! the soccer match just right there!

Sometimes, more rarely
..apparition of a mental disease called schyzophrenia.

Your girlfriend doesn't have any sense of humor.
You ain't got nothing better to do ?
Lola!

I get out. You wait 5 minutes
before getting out, is it clear ?
Yeah, well... I guess it's clear.
Lola!
Leave me alone

Everybody knows that this slut sucks in the toillets.

At least there's one girl who knows that
you can't get it hard.
Impressive!
I think that settles it.
I think so yeah!
Fuck!
Lola?

Lola...
Sweetheart?
Are you okay?
I'm fine
Come and eat.
One has to eat when one's sad.
I'm not hungry.
You're not gonna get anorexic, are you ?
You don't get anorexic just like that
I've seen it on a TV show, it comes quickly.
Don't worry
It's not that
You'll see.
It's not such a big deal.
<i>And I bend over you</i>
<i>A drop of dew on your lips</i>

Are you kidding me ?
<i>No mum I don't. I just can't get interested
in the global population of China</i>
<i>.. and in the activity of cells</i>
<i>The only thing I'm thinking about,</i>
<i>the only thing that hurts</i>
<i>..is Maël

<i>How am I gonna do that?</i>

Stop looking at them they'll think we're interested in them
We're interested in them.
A lil bit you gotta admit.
Don't you think they obsessed with us ?
Last time I played poker I had a three ases!
And this guy he had a fifth!

<i>-"One night, we were so fucking bored so
Charlotte called some friend from an old trip</i>
<i>"I thought only a whore
would call boys at night,..</i>
<i>"..but Charlotte said that they were the whores,..</i>
<i>"..and that life was too short to be fuckin bored
a saturday night."</i>
Leave me alone
Why are you doing this ?
<i>"Don't tell me that men
and women have the same sexuality."</i>
<i>"A woman with lovers
isn't necesarely a whore."</i>
What a fool I am.
What a goddamn fool I am!
Unbelievable
Shit!
Yeah, hello ?
Yeah, I'm fine
I was just leaving. Okay!
In two minutes. All right, see you then.
-Djamel and Vincent, is that right ?
-And maybe Gilles
Go straight to the Orfèvres
and give that to Manusco
He's been waiting for this all morning.
Ciao
Sorry I'm late
Doesn't matter. How you doin' ?
Fine
Well ?
What is it ?
Nothing
-What would you like ?
-2 minutes, please.
He'll think it's me who makes you cry
What's the matter ?
No no, nothing.
It's only human to have looked in this diary!
-You're not gonna feel guilty ?
-Yes, I feel guilty with kids.
When I let them do what they want
I feel guilty
When I yell, it's worse
I got the feeling of being a cop.
It sucks, doesn't it ?
yeah...
No but I don't how to say...
you see ?
We've been fighting all our life
..to have the same rights as you do,..
..and have the same sexuality.
-You, you said that ?
-You defended that ?
Absolutly
I defended that!
Whatever..
When you see your little girl like who
..goes live her life as a freed women,
you don't agree anymore.
I swear
I don't even what to think
You don't have to think anything.
She sleeps with some boys, she does drugs...
She tried to have sex with a boy
and she smokes a little bit.
No big deal.
Look who's talking
I know how to make the difference between
a teenager who's got issues..
..and on who checks where the limits are.
As long as it keeps hapening with people
the same age...
You're telling me this to cheer me up ?
I think that you think too much.
TEXT MESSAGE: "I'm leaving now, be there soon, Maël"

THe girl you had a date with ?
I've been standing here for an hour
Don't try to fool me.
Good evening sir.
Good evening Etienne. Thank you.
It's my son!
We can follow them if you want.
Yeah if it's okay with you.
I don't mind.
Do I go pick him up ?
No, I don't wanna cause a scene.
But it's unreal! 2 am. in the middle of the week.
What are the parents doing ?
Like you, sir.
And what is that ?
Thinking their children are sleeping.
You think my daughter is a lesbian ?
Hum.
"Hum" yes or "hum" no?
Hum.
Can you stop with your 'hum' and give
some real awnsers ?
Is it more chocking if she sleeps with
a girl instead of a boy ?
You know what, I prefer you 'hum'
-You see ?
-Hum
Hey, how you doing ?
You wanted...
..to talk to me?
We have to talk about Lola.
Hum
You're not gonna do that too?
Do what ?
My shrink always does some 'hum'
it drives me nuts
Yeah, and you told her that you're
screwing another guy ?
First, I'm not screwing anybody
Oh yeah that's right
I'm sorry
Us, men, we fuck bitches but you women
you make love with some extraordinary men.
Stop it!
It's not the time.
For you.
Because everything's fine with me
I'm chating with 'Madam I give lessons'
who causes a scene because she thinks
I'm "banging a bitch"
You sure you wanna take this path ?
Yeah, because you own me some explanation
I own you explanation
I remind you that we're divorced
Yeah when you feel like it
Well!
Lola does drugs
What ?
Joints, not yet some...
If you didn't leave your shit all over the house...
I remind you that you are her model on Earth.
If she follows you on the sex...
You're an asshole, you know that ?
It's amazing how big of an asshole you are.
Wait a sec, wait
I'm not an asshole, I'm just jealous
I came to talk to you about Lola.
We should get her to a private school.
When you feel like talking, call me.
Hello ? Lola, I have to tell you
I got nothing to say
I really had some troubles
I'm sick of all your lies
Are you kidding me ?
We're dining now!
Come on give me a break
No I don't give you a break
What's with all the yelling ?
I'm tired of all this mess!
Clean your room
Okay so I don't dine ?
After diner!
Don't act stupid!
And you stop it!
I'm sick of your bad behavior!
Me too I have a bad behavior ?
Mrs Delgado, please.
No, first I'll see the girl alone.
He! I don't wanna go to another school!
It's all I have, my friends!
You still has a familly!
That's nice!
Oh yeah I forgot, a familly who
have sex without telling me
I don't give a fuck about having a familly
No doubt, she's her father's daughter.
Yeah let's say that
-Sweetheart ?
-Hmm?
No, nothing
Look at this bitch
She acts like she won the match.
Pisses me off
It's not who Maël would chose
It's who every man would chose
She's ridiculous. You seen her shoes ?
-So lame!
-and she's coming with us in England
We should stop lookin at them 'cause otherwise...
He's gonna imagine I'm interested in him
Right
Stop it!
Stop it
Be quiet!
Who wrote that ?
Mehdi

So disgusting
Keep quiet

That you found her diary, that you read everything
No way, she'll never forgive me!
hmmm
take it, take it!
Hey!
-Hello, mam
-'lo
-see ya
-see ya, Lola.
You saw how you said hello to her ?
What do you mean ?
Cold as ice like "hello".
I'm not thrilled that you hang out with this girl
She's my best friend.
I hand out with whoever I want to!
It's my life!
I'm sorry ?
It's my life
You're my daughter, and you're not
18 yet, and there's a few things..
..that I don't accept, you feel me ?
And what might that be ?
That you're screwing up your life!
Not at all!
You smoke joints, you get drunk,
you sleep with whoever is there...
and you're not screwing up your life ???
Bullshit! Where'd you get that from ?
I know everything, Lola!
What ?
And stop acting like I'm a fool!
Like your father does
-You're so lame to say that
-I... I've read your diary!
You what ?
I didn't do it on purpose
Stop it! I's hidden!
At least, we know what we're talking about
You don't need to know about my life.
That's my private life
Don't try to be part of it
Fuck I'm tired of this
You have no rights
You're really a bitch!
You could write this one down on your diary!
Idiot!
-Lola!
-Mum!
Lola!
Lola!
Not enough men around here
What about me ?
Oh sweetheart...
Open up right now
It's my room
Even that you can't respect
We need to talk
Never again
Go fuck yourself!
You have no idea what you'll get when...
I don't even tell you
Where you going ?
-To my father's
You dreamnt about this. Is it a problem ?
Not a problem at all!
I can even take you there
No need for that!
See you everybody!
Where R U ?
At my father's...
I add garlic to the sauce
hmmm No
Huh... yes I add garlic to the sauce
I got into a fight with my mother!
And still your mother ain't like mine!
Charlotte!
Dinner's ready!

Ready for a "tongue lesson" ??
So the image of the triangle J.F.K
..by the translation of vector I.D
..is the triangle E.F.J..
..or E.A.F.?
I'm sorry ?
You know what a vector is ?
Yeah! a dvd 'vector'
(French joke: 'vecteur' (vector) is close to 'lecteur' (player))
-OK
(French joke: 'vecteur' (vector) is close to 'lecteur' (player))
and where are you going ?
hum... Well...
to the bathroom...
With your shoes ?
Well some people read magazines
I like to have my shoes...
Stop it!
You see this door ?
Brand new technology!
-The same museums use
-Museums ?
You get close to it, the laser detects
what you're
trying to get out and the alarm turns on
And.. you're punished
I didn't want to get out,
just go to the bathroom
Be careful!
You don't want it to turn on again!
Calm down, François!
-Understood ?
-Yes
-Yes, who ?
-Yes dad
You goin to sleep my love ?
See you tomorow
Good night
Come to bed
Why don't you say "my love" to me too ?

..shares many similarities with human.
For once we agree on sth..
-Mrs Clavel,
