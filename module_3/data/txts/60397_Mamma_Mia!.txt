Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
(ALL LAUGHING)
I missed you. Oh, no...
- We're...

ALL: Sophie, Ali, Lisa!
We're the greatest, bestest mates!
- I'm tough.
- I'm tall.
- I'm tiny.
- ALL: And we're gonna rock this place.
- Sophie, it's beautiful.
- I want one.
He did well, didn't he?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
I'm so glad you're here,
because I have a secret
and I can't tell anybody else.
- Sophie, you're knocked up?
- No! No! No!
I've invited my dad to my wedding.
You are joking!
- You found him at last?
- No! No, no, no, no, no, not exactly.
Okay. You know what my mom always said
when I asked about my father.
It was a summer romance,
and he'd gone long before she realised
that she was expecting me.
And I'd always kind of accepted that
that's all I'd ever know.
Well, I was ransacking some old trunks
and I found this.
It's the diary she kept
the year she was pregnant with me.
Sophie!
"July 17th. What a night!"
- I don't know if I want to hear this!
- I do!
"Sam rowed me over to the little island."
That's here. That's Kalokairi.
"We danced on the beach,
and we kissed on the beach,
"and dot, dot, dot."
What?
"Dot, dot, dot."
That's what they did in the olden days.
Stop it!
"Sam's the one. I know he is.
"I've never felt like this before."

Bride, although I've actually never met her.
BILL: Ahoy, there.
You guys need a ride to Kalokairi?
Excuse me, coming through.
I have a senior citizen with me. Thank you.
My mother needs a perch.

It's just a fish.
You are so clever.
We're going to look fabulous tomorrow.
I want the perfect wedding,
and I want my father to give me away.
Better be a wide aisle.
I will know my father as soon as I see him.
LISA: Sky! Come here, gorgeous.
SKY: Put me down.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Please be careful.
LISA: So?
SOPHIE: There are pins in the dresses.
What do you think?
Oh, yes!
"Oh, yes." If you had your way,
it'd be a three-minute wedding
in jeans and T-shirts,
washed down with a bottle of beer.
You make me sound so unromantic!
I just thought we should save
our money for travelling.
Well, we're not going anywhere yet.
Anyway, please leave. We're very, very busy.
I'm just getting some props for tonight.
LISA AND ALl: Ooh!
SOPHIE: For his bachelor party.
Why haven't you told him
you've invited your dads?
Because he would say that
I'd have to tell my mom.
Donna's absolutely gonna kill you
when she finds out.
By the time she finds out, it'll be too late.
I feel like there's a part of me missing,
and when I meet my dad,
everything will fall into place.

BILL: More open!
HARRY: I'm on it. I'm on it.
That's good.
That's it.
Come on, Cleopatra.

- And one night only.

Look at you!
- You baby!

You look fantastic!
You look like an old hippie!
She looks fab.
These are new, though.
Where did you get these?
Husband number three!
- Dynamos! Dynamite!
- Dynamos! Dynamite!
ALL: Sleep all day and...
(WHOOP) All night!

TANYA: So, any men at this wedding?
Gorgeous Greeks of independent means?
Here we go! Husband number four!
- No! Not for me, for her!
- He's coming!
For her, now that her book is a bestseller,
and she's got the whole world
stuffing, what,
mushrooms? Various vegetables?
It's time to find Mr Right!
Oh, please. Boring!
Great couple of role models
you two are for Sophie!
A serial bride and a little hermit over here!
That's me! I'm a lone wolf!
(HOWLING)
ROSIE: So, when are the lovebirds
flying the nest?
DONNA: Oh, God! Who knows?
You know, I do not know what is going on
in that child's head sometimes.
She wants a big white wedding, and
she and Sky are making
all kinds of plans for the hotel.
Sometimes I think they'll never leave.
Yeah, but do you really want her to?
Well, I want what's best for her.
Of course not!
(ALL LAUGHING)
Sky! Come meet my backup girls.
ROSIE: Backup girls, my ass!
TANYA: Backup girls, my ass!
He's the leading man at tomorrow's shindig.
- SKY: The lucky man.
- Hello.
- You must be Rosie.
- I am.
- How are you?
- Very well.
And you must be Tanya.
- I've heard so much about you.
- All bad, I hope.
- Yes.
- And all true.
Donna... Here, let me get them.
I know who you are.
You're Bill Anderson, aren't you?
<i>- Bloke in a Boat in Botswana.</i>
- Yes, I am.
You know, your books are a godsend
on dull business trips.
Now, I may look like I'm pondering
my securities, but in reality,
I'm trekking across
some remote corner of the planet.
You should try it for real sometime.
No, certainly, I'll never be
the spontaneous adventurer.
- You're a close friend of Donna's?
- No, I haven't heard from her for 20 years.
- SAM: Really?
- And then this invite, out of the blue.
You know, that's a coincidence,
neither had I.
- Going about!
- You got it!
Right. Wait...
I've got it. Fine. Fine.
ROSIE: You should have brought
the iron lung.
Why did I wear stilettos?
- (GASPING) Oxygen.
- Oh, my God!
- Auntie Rosie!
- Hey, hey!
- Look at Sophie. She's gotten so beautiful!
- I know.
ROSIE: Come here to me.
Sophie Sheridan, you get more gorgeous
every time I see you. You do.
- I bet you don't remember me.
- Not with all that plastic surgery.
Of course I do, Auntie Tanya.
You haven't changed at all.
- I'm so happy for you.
- Look at my baby,
her whole life ahead of her.
Oh, please, I'm getting married.
I'm not joining a convent!
- She's feisty. I love that.
- Yeah.
She's a chip off the old block.
If she were more like me,
she wouldn't be getting married at 20.
Or married at all.
I meant to get the laundry down
before you came.
ROSIE: Tanya's going home!
And you'd think with all this
new technology,
they would figure out a machine
that would make the beds.
And if they did,
you'd be going along behind it,
making them again.
I know you, Mom.
But I am good at modern...
Tell them about the Internets.
- He's gonna put me on the line.
- SOPHIE: Online.
SKY: I'm designing a website.
I just think this place has so much potential,
and no one knows we're here.
So, if I market it really, really well, then,
hopefully, people will come flooding in.
We just want this to be
the ultimate romantic destination.
This was once supposed to be
the site of Aphrodite's fountain,
you know, the goddess of love.
And if you drank the water,
you were supposed to find true love
and perfect happiness.
- I'll have a glass of that.
- Yeah, I'll have a bucket.
<i>TANYA: Aphroite's spa?</i>
Well, I thought you didn't want
boatloads of tourists.
Oh, no, not boatloads, no.
But, you know, a few more would be nice.
Okay, now, the thing about the toilet,
if it doesn't flush right away, just go
and come back in a while, and it should...
Nothing works around here, except for me.
I've been running this hotel for 15 years,
and I have never had a day off.
Oh, my God! Sorry.

Hi.
May I help you?
BILL: Sure, we're here for the wedding.
- I'm Bill Anderson.
- SOPHIE: Huh?
I'm Bright, Harry Bright.
Sam Carmichael.
You are expecting us?
Oh, my God. Yes!
You're not Donna's daughter?
BILL: I thought you looked familiar.
Sofia.
- It's Sophie.
- Well, Sofia is the Greek.
Well, I'm named after a Sofia.
I used to have a great-aunt
living on the mainland named Sofia.
Would you mind if we see our rooms
before we see your mother?
Sure.
It's just that I'd quite like to freshen up
before the big reunion.
No! No! I mean, yes,
but come this way.
Come on!
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, my God!
I got a crack in my courtyard.
I gotta go fix it.
- Hey, listen, Donna? Donna.
- I'm serious. Move.
Sit down!
- She won't let me go!
- I know...
I know you're going to make
a fortune with web's...
- "With web's..."
- With Sky's site.
I know you're gonna make a fortune with
- Sky's website, but...
- It's good.
Are you gonna be okay until then?
I think Tanya is offering to pawn her bling.
- No, seriously, Donna...
- Oh, my God.
- Do you need a loan?
- No, sweet.
Oh, God, I'm just whining, you know me.
I don't need to be taken care of.
Yeah, but are you being taken care of?
- What do you mean?
- Are you getting any?
Oh, you mean...

Down, boy, down, boy.
No, it takes too much energy.
Yeah. Just more plumbing

I don't want to seem ungrateful
for the scenic tour,
but might I be shown my room now?
Well, don't hold your breath, Harry,
but I think this is your room.
Can we see Donna now?
I sent the invites.
My mom doesn't know anything.
(SIGHING)
(GIGGLING)
Well, she's done so much for me,
and she's always talking about you guys
and the good old days, and
I thought, what an amazing surprise for her
that you are all gonna be at my wedding.
Hang on, Sophie.
I can't be here.
The last time I saw your mother,
she said she never wanted to see me again.
That was years ago.
Please, it would mean a lot to me.
- Why?
- HARRY: Listen, I can see that you've been
to a great deal of trouble.
Might I suggest that we all reconvene
on your boat?
- Good idea.
- Nope.
- Why?
- It's an adventure, Harry.
- It's good for you.
- Oh, I see.
Okay, when I sent the invites,
it was a long shot that you'd even reply.
And now you've come all this way
for a wedding.
Surely there must have been
some special reason for you to be here.
Like some siren call, maybe?
(ALL CHUCKLING)
You're a little minx, you know that?
You're just like your mother.
I'm glad my boys haven't met you.
They'd never recover.
- You have sons?

And someday, I'd like to bring them here.
Like you used to bring my mother?

- No.
- It's Donna.
(WHISPERING) No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Listen, listen, she can't know.
I'm going to go. Please stay.
Promise me that you'll not tell anybody
that I invited you.
Okay? Promise?
- You got it, baby.
- It's a promise.

- That's generally the definition.
Okay, good, but who... Why are you here?
Who said that you could
stay up in my old goat-house?
- BILL: Didrt catch the name.
- Greek lady.
- Well, she spoke Greek.
- Yeah.
Or maybe she said we couldn't
stay in the old goat-house.
- Yeah, maybe that was it, in Greek.
- There you go.
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
You can't stay here because
I'm closed and I'm full.

Sophie's dad.
Remember how I said it was Sam?
Sam the architect,
who had to go home to get married?
I'm not sure that it was him,
because there were two other guys
around the same time.
Donna Sheridan. You shady lady.
Why didn't you tell us?
Well, I never knew that
I would ever, ever have to.
I never imagined I'd see all three of them
in my old goat-house
the day before my daughter's wedding!

Shoot!
DONNA: Rosie! Tanya!
Wait a minute! Don't let them hear you!

- Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure!
Do you think
I would forget my daughter's dads?
They were all here. Sam Carmichael,
Bill Anderson and Harry "Head Banger."
ROSIE: Harry "Head Banger."

back to their boat.
I hope they run aground and drown.

It doesn't matter about me.
The only thing that matters
is that Sophie never finds out.
Well, maybe she would be cool with it.
"Cool with it"?
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
You don't know my daughter.
This would be like a bombshell.
Donna, they've gone!
I don't know that.
I don't know where they are.
I don't know why they're here.
And I have brought this all on myself
because I was a stupid, reckless little slut!
Whoa!
Don't you sound like your mother?
- I do not!
- Yes, you so do!
- Oh, my God, I do not.
- You do, it's Catholic guilt!

Yeah, whatever happened to our Donna?

SOPHIE: Wait, wait. Wait!
ALl: Hey, don't leave.
- Whoa, Sophie.
- Sophie!
We're gonna sail around the island.
You wanna come?
You promised you'd come to my wedding.
Yes, well, your mother ejected us
from the goat-house.
She thought we'd better get out of her hair.
BILL: Donna freaked out when she saw us.
- What's all that about?
- No.
She's just not even thinking straight.
She's so stressed about the wedding.
You know, but she's got no idea
that you're her lovely surprise.
- She'll be so happy tomorrow.
- (CHUCKLES) You think so?
HARRY: Mmm-hmm.
- You took Mom's guitar!
- No, no. I borrowed it. Look.
No, where is it?
D.S.
Donna Sheridan.
And H.B.
Head Banger.
- Head Banger?
- Head Banger?
I bought her this. It cost me ten quid
plus my Johnny Rotten T-shirt.
Your mother knew quite a rebel.
I was studying in Paris when I met her.
I hopped on a train
and followed her to Greece,
quite spontaneously.

the greatest adventure of my life.

You know how I said I wanted

Soph, we've been over this a million times.
You don't need a father, you have a family.

You have turned my world upside down.

Oh, no, really. You should wait

This is good. This is really good.
Why don't you pursue this?
You have a real talent here.

I have enough to do here.
Is that really your dream?
Running the villa with Donna?
She just can't do it by herself.
Do you know,
I drew this whole place up
on the back of a menu one night.
I always dreamt I'd come back here.
What kept you?
What's your mother said about me?
- She never mentioned you.
- Sophie?
What am I doing here?
DONNA: Some air in here.

Listen, what we're gonna do is,
we'll get them plastered tonight,

I don't know who my father is.

How on earth did Donna get money
to buy this place?
She was left some money by the old lady
she looked after when I was little.
- Sofia, that I'm named after.
- My great-aunt Sofia?
I guess.
I always heard her money was left to family.
- How old are you?

Will you excuse me a minute?
I'm sorry.

Bill, wait.
Why did your great-aunt

Yes. I think so.

and I have to tell two of them
they're surplus. Only, which two?
It's all under control.
I'm taking Bill and Sam fishing...
We're each gonna go off.
We're gonna grab a man,

Last night,
I discovered something wonderful.
It was a wake-up call,
a way to look at myself and
what I really want out of life.
(CHUCKLING) Last night? You didn't know?
You didn't even suspect that you were...
Well, no. Of course not.
That's always been a secret.
And now we... Say it out loud.
No! No! No! It's absolutely hush-hush.
I mean, for now.
All will be revealed tonight.
BILL: Talking of revelations, last night...
You and the little lady?
I think I know what's going on.
(CHUCKLING)
- No, you don't. You don't.
- It's obvious.
I saw it from the moment
you clapped eyes on each other.
BILL: You're kidding.
I'm gonna level with you, Harry.
I don't think I can do this.
Well, she's a wonderful girl,
but can I take her on in my life?
Bill, where's your spontaneity?
It's this...
- This family, you know?
- You don't have to marry her.
What?
(SQUEALS IN GREETING)
Hey, right in time for breakfast.
We're serving up the works here.
- Think you just did.
- BILL: Sunny-side up! Lox or ham?
I'll just...
I'm just gonna...

Last night, you and Sky... What's wrong?
Tell me. Tell me what's wrong.
- I don't know what to do.
- You know what to do.
You don't have to do anything.
Not too late, I can still call off the wedding.

No.
No, that's what you want.

You just... You have no idea.
You never had a wedding.
You never did
the marriage-and-babies thing.
You just did the baby thing.
- Well, good for you.
- You know, I don't know why
- you're going off on me now! I really don't!
- Because I...
- God! I love Sky, and I want to be with him!
- Good! Great.
And I don't want my children growing up
not knowing who their father is.

You guys... He's got to get ready.
I see you kept my bagpipes.
They're supposed to ward off
unwanted visitors.
Well, you don't need bagpipes to do that.
What are you doing here, Sam?
This is our dream, remember?
- Villa on the island?
- Yeah. Well, this is my reality.
Hard work and a crippling mortgage. Shoot!
And a hotel that's crumbling around me.
- Look, I'll help... Let me have a look at this...
- No, that's all right, I can
deal my own disasters.
Why didn't you tell me
it was Sophie getting married?
Well, I didn't think
it was any of your business.
Why is she getting married?
Settling down on the island?
I mean, if it was up to me,
I'd be telling her to go get a life.
- Yeah.
- She's a bright kid.
I know. I know.
But, you know, my daughter
has a mind of her own.
Oh, yeah. I see that. I see that.
- But she's so young.
- I know.
I mean, does she know
what she really wants?
You see, I think part of her
just wants to let you know
that she isn't going to leave you
alone here, on your own.
- What do you mean?
- Donna, look.
I have two grown children.
I know something about letting go.
If Sophie felt you were okay on your own,
would she want something different
for herself?
Okay, here's the thing.
I love being on my own. I really do.
You know, every morning,
I get up and I thank God
that I don't have some middle-aged,
menopausal man
telling me how to run my life.
You know, I'm free and I'm single.
And it's great.

Sophie!
Soph.
I've done something completely insane.
All my dads are here for our wedding,
and they all think they're giving me away.
(CHUCKLING IN CONFUSION)
All your what?
I read Mom's diary,
and I have three possible fathers.
But how are they here now?
I invited them.
I thought that I would know my dad
right away,
but I didn't. I just...
I have no idea.
And now, my mom is gonna kill me,
- and they're gonna hate me, and you...
- Hold on. Hold on.
You invited these guys
and you didn't tell me?
No, I thought you would try to stop me.
- I know I messed up.
- Sophie?
Is that what this whole
big white wedding is about?
- You finding your dad?
- No. No!
I wanted to take a boat to the mainland
with a couple of witnesses.
And you insisted on this sodding circus
so you could play Happy Families.
It's about knowing who I am. And I wanted
to get married knowing who I am.
That doesn't come from finding your father,
that comes from finding yourself.
And the irony is,
I was travelling to find myself.
I put everything on hold for you.
Because I loved you
and I wanted what you wanted.
Now, I don't know.
You don't know if you love me?
Of course I love you.
I just wish you'd told me.
Is everything okay?
- Sophie, what's wrong?
- Not now, Sam.
Yes, yes, yes, now.
Because I'm supposed to be
giving you away.
And how can I when I know
you're not really gonna be happy?
I've heard all this from my mother, and
I think she knows me better than you do.
I know. But I've done the big white wedding,
and believe me,
- it doesn't always end in "happy ever after."
- That is you. That's not me.
Okay? I love Sky more than anything
in the world. And I...
(GRUNTS)
Did you feel that way
before you got married?
No.
Hey, aren't you supposed to be
getting dressed?
Where's Ali and Lisa?
I thought they were going to help you.
Will you help me?
Mmm-hmm.

(MUSIC BOX PLAYING)
Do you think I'm letting you down?
Why would you even think that?
Well, because of what you've done.
I mean, the Dynamos, raising a kid,
and running a business all on your own.
Well, honey, I didn't have a choice.
I couldn't go home, you know.
When I got pregnant, my mother told me
not to bother coming back.
And I wouldn't have had it any other way.
My God, look at what we've had.
Will you give me away?
Yeah.

It's what she wants.
She told me she wants her father here.

I can't hear this now!
Donna, listen to me. This is about us.

Donna, there you are.
- It's okay.
- They're my best shoes.
LISA: Panic over! Here she is.
ALl: She's here.
- Oh, don't worry.
- Oh, God.
(BAND PLAYING SOFT MUSIC)
(WHISPERS) I love you.
Welcome to Sophie and Sky,
and to all your friends
who have gathered together this evening.
And welcome, especially, to Donna,
who represents your family.
We are all here together in this
- glorious...
- And welcome to...
(SIGHING) To
Sophie's dad.
(PEOPLE GASPING)
- I have to tell you. He is here.
- I know. I invited him.
You couldn't have.
I don't know which one it is.
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
Oh, my God.
- That's why they're all here!
- I'm sorry. Sorry. I just...
Please, please forgive me!
Please forgive me. Please.
I don't know.
- Can you forgive me?
- What?
I don't care if you slept with
hundreds of men.
You're my mom, and I love you so much.
Oh, Soph.
(UNDER HER BREATH)
And I haven't slept with hundreds of men.
(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)
Am I getting this right?
Sophie may be mine,
but she may be Bill's or Harry's?
Yeah, yeah. That's right.
And don't get all self-righteous with me,
because you have
no one but yourself to blame.
Yeah, if you hadrt just dumped my mother
and gone off and married somebody else...
Hey, hey, wait a minute!
I had to go home. I was engaged.
But I told Lorraine I couldn't marry her,
and I came right back.
You... You...
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
- Why didn't you call me?
- Because I was crazy enough
to think that you would be waiting for me.
Only when I arrived, they told me
you were off with some other guy.
So, Lorraine called me an idiot
and married me to prove it.
Sorry, can I just... Might I just butt in?
DONNA: Oh, Harry, don't... It's all right.
You don't have to.
No, no, I just wanted to say it's great
to have even a third of Sophie.
I never thought I'd get
even that much of a child.
Donna, you were the first girl I ever loved.
Well, actually, you were
the last girl I ever loved.
Now, this gives me an excuse
to come here much more often.
We can find out if you want,
but I'm with Harry.
- Being a third of your dad is great by me.
- BILL: By me, too.
I'll take a third.
Typical, isn't it? You wait 20 years for a dad,
and then three come along at once.
Dearly beloved...
You know, I have no clue which one of you
is my dad, but I don't mind.
Now, I know what I really want.
Sky, let's just not get married yet.
- What?
- What?
You never wanted this anyway.
I know that. Let's just get off this island
and just see the world. Okay? All right?
I love you.
(ALL CHEERING)
Donna, do I take it the wedding
is cancelled?
I'm not entirely sure
what's happening right now.
Hang on.
Why waste a good wedding?
How about it, Sheridan?
You're going to need someone
to boss around on this island of yours.
Are you nuts? I am not a bigamist.
Neither am I. I'm a divorced man
who's loved you for 21 years,
and ever since the day
I set foot on this island,
I've been trying to tell you
how much I love you.
