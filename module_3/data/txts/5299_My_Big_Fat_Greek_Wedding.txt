You'd better get married soon.
You're starting to look... old.
My dad has been saying that
to me since I was 15...
Nice Greek girls
are supposed to do three things:
Marry Greek boys,
make Greek babies, feed everyone...
until the day we die.
When I was growing up,
I knew I was different.
The other girls
were blond and delicate.
And I was
a swarthy 6-year-old with sideburns.
I wanted
to be like the popular girls...
all sitting together, talking
and eating their Sandwiches.
What's that?
- It's moussaka.
Moose Caca?
While the pretty girls got to go to
Brownies I had to go to Greek school.
O Nikos ehee...
...ena katsiki.
I learned valuable lessons like:
'If Nick has one goat and Maria
has nine, how soon will they marry? '
My mom was always cooking foods
filled with warmth and wisdom,
never forgetting
the side dish of steaming hot guilt.
Niko, don't play with the food.
When I was your age,
we didn't have food.
Ma?
- What?
Why do I have
to go to Greek school?
Don't you want to be able to write
your mother-in-law a letter?
Niko, come on, eat!
We lived in a middle-class Chicago
neighborhood of modest homes.
Our house
was modeled after the Panthenon...
complete with Corinthian columns
and guarded by statues of the gods.
If the neighbors had
any doubts about our heritage...
they could check out
our subtle tribute to the Greek flag.
My dad believed in only two things:
Non-Greeks should be
educated about being Greek...
and any ailment,
from psoriasis to poison ivy...
could be cured with Windex.
Six years later I was 12,
my older perfect sister Athena
was 15, and Nick was 11.
In the morning Dad would lecture us
on the history.
and civilization of the Greeks.
Okay, now name
three things the Greeks did first.
Astronomy, philosophy, democracy.
Bravo. Very good.
Now give me a word...
any word, and I will show you
how the root of that word is Greek.
Okay.
How about 'arachnophobia'?
'Arachna' comes from
the Greek word for 'spider'...
and 'phobia' is 'phovia',
means 'fear', so fear of spider.
Okay, Mister Portokalos,
how about the word 'kimono'.
Kimono?
Of course,
'kimono' comes from the Greek word
'himona', which means winter.
So, what do you wear in winter
to stay warm? A robe.
You see, 'robe', 'kimono'.
There you go.
Bye.
- Good-bye, Mister Portokalos.
Toula...
You should be proud to be Greek.
Some years later...
Dad brought his mother
from Greece to live with us...
because we weren't weird enough.
Listen up.
You ugly Turk.
You're not kidnapping me.
Ah, Kosta, get her, where's she...
- Greeks and Turks are friends now...
We told her war was over, but she
still had a knife under her pillow.
Stop hitting me.
Niko, be careful.
She has a very mean punch.
Nice Greek girls without husbands
work in the family restaurant.
So here I am.
Day after day, year after year.
Thirty,
and way past my expiration date.
God, it's freezing.
Toula...
You closed last night,
you're opening this morning?
I have no life.
- Ah, you talk to me sometime, eh?
I'm gonna swallow my tongue.
Is Nikki here?
What's up, Thea?
- My Nikki wanted to curl my hairs.
Nick, did you check the meat
before you signed it?
Dad checked it.
- It had better be fresh.
Nick has two jobs:
To cook and to marry a Greek virgin.
Voula, eat something before you work.
- No.
My aunt Voula could
win a gold medal in nagging.
Taki.
You couldn't wait for me?
Sorry.
- Sorry, sorry, don't sorry me.
Look at this, a rash.
Somebody gave me the mati.
Put some Windex on.
- Gus, please, please.
Voula, this works. Last night
my toe was a big as my face.
No.
- So why didn't you wait for me.
Kosta... he wants to talk.
Anyway, I tell her I'll send her
to Greece to find somebody.
Isn't she too old?
She is okay.
- Don't tell anyone how old she is.
She won't go.
She won't go?
It's like she
doesnâ€™t want to get married.
My sister became
a Greek baby breeding machine.
A quick coffee. I need to drop them
off at hockey and go to the Jewel.
Pantyhose are on for 99 cents.
The priest will bless
the house so I have to make diples.
And I'm out of honey.
Put that back for me.
Angelo.
- Shut up, Nikki.
My cousins have two volumes:
loud and louder
- Your big-ass girlfriend.
We're not that late.
Angelo...
Why didn't you
come to curl my hairs.
I had to drop Dimos at work...
and open the travel agency...
cause some jag-off and
his big-ass girlfriend are busy.
I open the dry cleaner every day.
It's time she did something...
D'you know who's been...
- You're always at the beauty parlor.
You and
your big-ass girlfriend do nothing...
Your hair looks a bit flat up there.
- Angelo, bite me.
Come on, boys,
let's go.
Athena, when did you come?
- Hi Mum. Bye Mum.
I'm going to the Jewel.
I'll get you some pantyhose.
No Queen size,
they make me look fat.
No more funny games.
- I didn't do it.
Who put the menus there?
Toula, what's this? What is this?
- I don't know.
Don't forget, I need diples and ...
- Pastichio for Papa, I know. My God.
You drive me crazy, let's go.
- I wanna drive.
To me she looks okay.
- Okay? Not okay.
She's not okay. Athena is
married with three children.
And I'll get married, I promise.
- You have plenty of time. Niko.
And you'll always have
Toula to run the restaurant.
Right.
Toula will never leave you.
I wish I had a different life.
I wish I was braver and prettier...
or just happy.
But it's useless to dream,
because nothing ever changes.
Hey, what's going on?
- Hi, man. How are you?
Good. And you?
Good.
Cool place.
- Yes. You missed a hell of a party.
Look... This could've been you.
- You set me up with her already.
Nancy?
- Henson's picnic.
No, that was Pamela.
This is Nancy.
They look the same.
- Maybe.
You want me to set you up?
- They're all the same.
My brain stopped.
It's one of those days when you say
'brr', going along and 'brr', stop.
Here I am,
like your own Greek statue.
Could I get some more coffee.
- Sure.
Let's go.
- I just got here.
I got a class though.
- What spice is on the potatoes?
Like I care. I'm giving a pop quiz
and I can't wait to hear the groans.
Man, you're tough. I gave a test
on Hamlet but I gave fair warning.
Keep the change.
You like this, for the new menu?
- Where did you get that.
I drew it, Dad.
Dad, I've been going
through our inventory...
we've been doing a lot of
unnecessary ordering.
Maybe we should update our system.
We could get a computer.
I got all A's in computers
but there are new things to learn.
If you want I could go
to college and take a few courses.
Why...
why do you wanna leave me?
I'm not leaving you.
I wanna do something with my life.
Get married, make babies.
You look so old.
Toula.
Come on, Toula.
I know what you want. You have...
how do you say... spirit.
You wanna see things, want to learn.
I know, you're from my side.
Don't you worry.
I'm going to talk to him.
He's so stubborn. What he says goes.
'The man is the head of the house.'
Let me tell you something:
The man is the head
but the women is the neck...
and she can turn
the head anywhere she wants.
Oh, my baby, don't cry.
Come on.
What's wrong with
Toula going to school downtown.
There's drugs downtown.
- What are you saying?
If someone says to her 'Take this bag
to the bus depot', she'll do it.
She's not stupid. She's smart.
I know. Then, why go to school?
She's smart enough for a girl.
You think you're smarter than me?
No, I mean... you know...
- What? What do you mean?
I run the restaurant, cook, clean
and wash. I raised three kids...
and I teach in Sunday school.
I'm lucky I have to tie my shoes.
Excuse me, is this seat taken?
- Sure.
What are you talking about?
- I don't like my butt, Taki does.
I won't pretend that I've always
wanted to be in the business.
I've been learning about computers
and there's this seminar...
about computers and tourism. I could
apply the latest applications here.
Your business would triple and you'd
have more time. Would you hire me?
Of course.
Oh, my god. Okay.
That's... Oh, my god.
Kosta has to think it was his idea...
- Alright, I know.
He's going to figure it out.
- Don't worry.
I know what to do.
- Yes just talk all the time.
Do you want to help me?
Don't tell me what to say.
So, Voula,
how is business?
Dear me.
Business is bad.
What happened?
Do you need money?
What she means is...
With the two business she suffers.
She suffers. She has to be
at the travel agency alone all day...
because everyone else needs to
be working at the dry cleaning store.
That's right. I made Taki
go to the dry cleaning store...
and now I have no time with him.
Send Angelo or Nikki to the agency
and you can be with Taki.
That would be good.
- That's not good...
because neither Angelo or Nikki
know how to use the computer.
That's why it wouldn't work.
Computer?
I have the answer:
Toula will go to the travel agency
and Nikki will work here for us.
I can't believe this. It's wonderful.
- See, a man...
You're so smart.
Gus.
Mrs. Christakos, thanks for holding.
Your request is now PNR'd...
British Airways? I'm gonna
need a hard Tic on that one.
Reading Alpha, Bravo, Foxtrot,
Charley, Roger. Copy that.
Mrs. Christakos? Your tickets are
now in the mail. Thank you. Bye-bye.
I'll get it.
Did you lose this?
Bloodthirsty Turks.
Mrs. White,
you found my mama again.
She comes from Greece.
The country I come from...
For God's sake, I know. Listen,
keep your mother off my lawn.
out of my basement
and away from my roof.
Mrs. White, come on,
give me a word, any word...
and I will show you that
the root of the word... is Greek.
Look, everybody.
Look, who's back again.
Sit down, Yiayia.
Very good.
There are two kinds of people:
Greeks and those wishing to be Greek.
Yes, we know.
- What's the matter with her.
Mount Olympus Travel Agency.
Sure, that's what we do.
Absolutely... right.
You can book it know. I can reserve
a seat for you... Just a second...
Just call me back
when you're ready to book.
You wanna see some brochures?
Found them.
Like this...
and then whoosh... you were gone.
I thought you fainted.
I was swept off my feet
by your cool opening line of 'Hi'.
So, Toula...
Ian... Ian Miller.
Toula Porkiparkas?
- Portokalos... Kalos.
Ok, Toula.
- Alright then.
Was that
a biker fight or a nose job?
Oh... yeah.
- No, really.
You don't want to know.
If I had survived an old lady
ass-kicking I'd brag about it.
You wanna have dinner with me?
- Yes.
I wasn't in education first.
I was pre-law.
My dad's a lawyer
and my grandfather's a lawyer...
and this wasn't for me.
So... I picked a new major.
And the parents weren't too pleased.
I think it takes
a pretty strong person to do that.
You know everything then. I'm a
pretty strong vegetarian teacher...
who grew up in Lincoln Park. I donâ€™t
know anything about you...
except that you're Greek.
Would you like to have Greek food?
- No, it's ok.
I know this really great place...
you probably know it... Zorba...
I would like to take you there...
- No, I don't want to go there.
Why not?
That place... Dancing Zorba's...
- Dancing Zorba's.
My family owns that restaurant.
Really?
I remember you. You're that waitress.
Seating hostess, actually.
I remember you.
- I was going through a phase...
up till now and...
I was a Frump-Girl.
I don't remember Frump-Girl,
but I remember you.
Ok, Italian then. Tomorrow night?
- Ok.
Where are you going?
- I'm taking a pottery class.
The Greeks invented pottery.
So it's just me with my parents
in this cottage all summer.
Don't your cousins go up too.
- No.
I only have two cousins in Wisconsin.
- You only have two cousins?
How many do you have?
- More than two.
Who else? Brothers and sisters?
What are your parents like?
What?
- Well...
What do you do
for Christmas with your family?
My Mom makes roast lamb.
- With mint jelly?
And...?
I'm Greek, right?
So, my dad and my uncles fight over
who gets to eat the lamb brain.
My aunt forks the eyeball, I have to
eat it 'cause it'll make me smart'.
You have two cousins.
I have 27 first cousins...
My family is big, loud, everybody's
in each other's lives and business.
You never have a minute alone,
we're always together, just eating.
We only know Greeks...
'cause we only marry Greeks to breed
more Greeks, to be loud Greek eaters'.
Serious. No one in my family has gone
out with a Non-Greek before.
You're...
You're just... you know, wonderful.
But I just don't see
how this is going to work out.
What's to work out?
We're not a different species.
We have different backgrounds
but here's some news about my life:
It's boring. Then I met you and...
you're interesting, beautiful and fun.
Whose family is not weird?
I just want
to spend some time with you.
I just want
to spend a little time with you.
Did you say I'm beautiful?
Yes.
Which house is yours?
- Could you stop here?
Sure.
- Right here is good. Just stop.
Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
- What? No, don't go.
Good night.
- Don't go.
And I can make a man out of you
because I'm a women...
W O M A N...
Happy again, Toula?
- Yes.
Now, every time I see you,
you have a great big smile.
Niko, where did you go?
- Nowhere?
What did you do?
Nothing.
Whom did you see?
- No one.
Wait a minute,
I'll put them in your room. Toula
Your class. How is your class?
- My pottery class?
It's great.
- Good.
Get out of here.
- One more kiss and I'll go.
Get out of here.
- One more kiss and I'll go.
No...
What is going on?
Mister Pottery class,
nice to meet you.
Ian, this is my cousin Nikki.
- Hallo.
It's nice to finally meet
a member of Toula's family.
I'm the least of your worries.
The family knows.
Last night Vicki Pavlopoulos saw you
suckin' his lips in the parking lot.
She told her ma,
who told my ma, who told your ma.
Let me put it this way:
You're busted.
You sneak all over Chicago but never
asked me 'Can I date your daughter?'
I'm sorry... but ask you if I can
date your daughter? She's thirty.
I am the head of this house.
May I please date your daughter?
No.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you.
Excuse me.
Didn't I say
it's a mistake to educate women?
But nobody listened to me.
Now we have
a boyfriend in the house.
Is he a nice Greek boy?
No. No Greek.
A xeno.
A xeno with long hair...
on top of his head.
Kosta.
I'm sorry I lied to you.
Fine, Toula, maybe
you're having a little romance...
but end it now.
I love him.
- Toula, eat something.
Please.
Your father has a friend for dinner.
What's this? Where are you?
- My apartment.
You gonna go up?
This is it.
Don't worry, they'll love you.
'Toula'.
That's not a name you hear every day.
What does it mean in your language?
My Greek name, Fotoula,
means 'Light of God'.
Who would like coffee?
So, you're Greek then?
What's your last name?
Portokalos.
- In Greek it means 'orange'.
Like an orange that you eat. The one
with the peel, not the color.
It's really Greek.
Rodney, didn't you once
have a Greek receptionist?
No, Harriet, she was...
just a minute...
No, she was a Armenian.
Is Armenia close to Greece?
Not exactly.
- What was she?
Who?
My secretary.
Everyone likes cheesecake?
- Guatemalan.
That's right, dear.
She was Guatemalan.
I love you.
- I love you.
I don't...
I don't know how to say this...
Will you marry me?
- Yes.
Because now you can have this.
Enough. Enough.
Don't you walk away from me.
Sit down.
Kosta, they love each other.
It's done.
How...
how can she do this to me?
She didn't do this to you or to me.
They fell in love, it happens.
Is he a good boy? Is he from
a good family? I don't know.
Is he respectful?
I don't know...
because nobody
talks to me about anything.
A respectful boy would come here
and ask for my permission.
My daughter engaged to a xeno.
She was supposed to get married
in the Greek Orthodox Church.
Why is she doing this to me?
Sometimes their space is
so big that the roof collapses...
Excuse me.
Try not to be too loud.
What's going on? Are you okay?
- Can we go to Vegas?
Can we go to Niagara Falls?
You want to go to Fiji?
Sure.
- Okay, let's go. Come on.
Come here.
What's the matter?
I just feel like we can't
get married, not like this.
It's like... when I'm with you
I'm so happy...
but my family is unhappy. Our wedding
should be this joyous thing...
but not for them
if it's not in our church.
So, let's just go somewhere.
Please, let's just go.
I love you.
- Why... why do you love me?
Because I came alive when I met you.
- But my family...
You're part of your family.
I'll do anything...
whatever it takes to get them
to accept me. You're my life now.
We won't skulk off and get married
as if weâ€™re ashamed of ourselves.
Did you say 'skulk'?
Let's just skulk off somewhere...
Come on, talk to him.
Toula loves him, do it for her.
Come on. He wants
to get married in the church.
So, you want
to be baptized tomorrow?
It's your lucky day to be baptized
in the Greek Orthodox church.
Nikki is going to be your godmother.
You know, the word 'baptism'...
comes from the Greek word vaptisia.
That's where we dip the baby
in a beautiful, little silver basin.
It's not so bad.
- Are you kidding?
Any minute he's going to look at me
and go 'You're so not worth this'.
Yes, you are.
You're all oily.
I'm Greek now.
Thank you so much.
For 'Happy Easter'
we say Hristos Anesti.
If you want to say 'Happy Easter',
you go Hristos Anesti. Try.
That's good.
Mr. Portokalos. Hristos Anesti.
When my people were writing
philosophy, you were on the trees.
He likes you.
- Yes?
I told you to watch the boys.
- They're okay with the video games.
You turn their brains to mush.
- I can't do anything right.
In this family
you're going to need earplugs...
because if the Portokalos women
cannot nag somebody, they die.
There's trouble if I tell my sister.
- Tell me what?
Hristos Anesti.
- Hristos Anesti, Thea.
You're engaged. We never thought
this could happen to you, never.
We never thought it would come.
- Never... and it came.
Is this him?
- Yes. Sorry, everyone, this is Ian.
Hey, Ian. You like that dance?
- Yes.
Jennie wants to ask you something.
- Just ask me.
Does he have any brothers?
- No, he's an only child.
I've got to tell you,
I've never seen my sister so happy.
If you hurt her, I'll kill you
and make it look like an accident.
Look at your face. It's just a joke.
- Good one.
The good one is, I've got a gun.
And I swear I'll jam it up your...
Ian, I got you again.
Eat some rice.
- No, I'm good.
I could snap you like a chicken.
Come on, lighten up. I'll lighten you
when I take out your kidneys.
One more time, Ian. Angelo.
- Ian, we're going to kill you.
Ian, Aunt Voula.
Let me touch your hair.
Okay, Voula?
- Yes, okay.
Come to my house
and I'll cook for you.
Voula, that might be a problem.
- I'm the best cook in the family.
I did, didn't I?
- Twice.
It's just...
Ian is a vegetarian.
He doesnâ€™t eat meat.
- He doesn't eat meat?
What do you mean,
'he doesn't eat meat'?
That's okay. I'll make lamb.
Come, come. Dance.
Greek.
You're watching Greek.
Silence...
It's delicious.
We took a look at my calendar,
our calendar, to set a day...
for the big day. Sometime at
the end of October, mid-November...
Wonderful. I'll call the Club and
see what's open.
The North Shore Country Club.
For the wedding, of course.
We'll get married in Toula's church.
We're not religious...
and her family is.
Show them the brochure.
My cousin Nikki made this. She saves
things, this is from her prom.
She makes lamps and...
- We got this great big hall...
What's it called for the reception?
- Aphrodite's Palace.
This is a brochure.
That Panthenon backdrop is optional.
If we invite the Demakopoulos,
we also have to invite their cousins.
Kosta. Xero.
- Dad, we want to keep it small.
You'd rather go bankrupt
than insult anyone.
Toula, I came to this country
with eight dollars in my pocket...
to make all this for you.
Who knows how long I'm going to live.
- Let me see the list.
Come on. Time out.
No more punching on Niko's nads.
Foti.
Look at you. How big you are.
Did she spit on him?
- Yes, it keeps the devil away.
Where did you get that?
- I drew for the new menu.
Mum, I'm hungry.
- Okay. Ian, are you hungry?
No, I already ate.
- I'll make you something.
Okay.
- We have to have Tommy Kassimatis.
Let me help you.
- What's wrong with Kassimatis?
I don't know them.
- They're related to me.
Why are you being so weird?
- I'm not.
Ian. Eat, eat.
How to say 'thank you' in Greek.
- Oraya visia.
Right. You got it.
Nice boobs.
I got the greatest connection
for your invitations.
No, we're gonna order
our own invitations.
I don't want anything
that has fallen off a truck.
But it works.
- Let him talk. You're so stubborn.
I'm not.
- I ordered them two weeks ago.
I never saw a wedding invitation.
- I'll get them.
My parents' names are
Rodney and Harriet.
Rodney and Harry?
- Rodney and Harry.
I didn't notice. They won't either.
- Hi everybody. Hi Yiayia.
Wait, I've got the biggest scoop.
These earrings match
the bridesmaids' dresses.
One of our customers is a
custom jewelry designer.
I showed her the fabric...
- But not those I saw last week.
You liked them.
- I said I'd think about it.
That's just because...
you couldn't visualize it.
You're so beautiful.
- That's classy.
I went by the college
and picked this up.
Look.
I'm going to start slowly...
and do a couple of night courses.
I just want to learn more
about painting and art, so...
This is great.
- You started it.
You wanted to do something else...
and you did it.
Toula, don't left
the past dictate who you are...
but let it be part of
who you will become.
Nick, that is beautiful.
Yes. That Dear Abby, she really knows
what she's talking about.
Hi, Ma, it's me.
- Calla.
Ian and I will pick up his parents.
We'll be there in an hour.
Good.
- What are you doing?
I peel the potatoes.
- I peeled some this morning.
We need more.
- How much do you cook for them?
It's many people.
- They're three.
Altogether we'll be seven.
- And the family.
You invited the whole family?
- Of course.
I invited them for a quit dinner.
- They might as well meet all of us.
Maria.
- I have to go. Taki's here.
I'm coming.
Look at this. Bravo.
Hurry, put it on the spit.
They are here.
Welcome to my home.
Over here is my brother Ted
and his wife Melissa...
and their children
Anita, Diane and Nick.
Here's my brother Tommy,
his wife Angie and their children.
My brother George,
his wife Freida and their children.
Taki, Sophie, Carrie,
Nick, Nick, Nick...
Nikki...
And I am Gus.
They are here?
Where? Excuse me.
Hello.
I am Maria Portokalos...
and welcome to our house.
Thank you. What is it?
It's a bundt.
It's a cake.
I know.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
There is a hole in this cake.
Here are some of my cousins.
- Ian, good to see you, man.
I really think you should say
Eho tria arhidia.
It means 'Let's go in the house'.
They will like it.
Good, you got it.
I'm not falling for it again.
What?
- Angelo.
How do you say
'let's go in the house'?
Everyone!
I have three testicles!
This is from Mykonos,
beautiful island. We're from there.
You like them? I make them.
Come, sit down. Go, go.
Sit, sit. Go now.
Sit down.
- Thank you.
Now you are family.
All my life I had a lump
at the back of my neck, right here.
Then I started menopause, the lump
got bigger because of the hormones.
I went to the doctor who did the...
the... bibopsy.
Inside the lump he found
teeth and a spinal column.
Inside the lump...
was my twin.
Spanakopita!
Are you hungry?
They just go here.
Let them settle in.
I love it when you speak Greek.
It's sexy. Having a good time?
Rodney, Harry.
Ouzo?
It's licorice.
- It's delicious.
Another. You are Greeks now.
Don't be shy.
Don't worry, I'll be back.
The meat is here, everybody.
It's very good.
Would you like some meat?
Greek meat... very good.
Red meat, everybody?
Coming through, coming through.
And now, the bundt cake.
- You fixed it.
I tried, you tried.
We were all nice to them...
but they look at us
as if weâ€™re from the zoo.
This won't work.
They are different people.
They're so dry... that family is
like a piece of toast.
My daughter is going to marry
Ian Miller, a xeno...
a xeno with a toast family.
In Toula's church the best man
has to be Greek Orthodox, so...
I can't ask you to be my best man.
You were going to ask me
to be your best man?
I am touched. I had no idea
you had so few friends.
That's okay, just give me a badge
that says 'best man' or something.
No offence, but this girl's family
got you by the short ones.
If they say 'jump' and
you will pull out the trampoline.
My life is shit.
Toula's got a lot of cousins.
I'll fix you up.
That's going to happen...
Toula.
What is wrong?
All right.
Is my marriage killing Dad?
Toula. Your father is your father.
He just wants you to be happy.
But I am happy.
Listen to me, Toula.
My village saw many wars...
Turkish, German...
They all made a mess.
And my mother, she said:
'We're lucky to be alive. '
And I thought:
'We're not lucky to be alive. '
'We're not lucky, when we're told
where to live and what to eat. '
Nobody has that right.
And then, I see you.
I see Athena and Niko...
We came here for you.
So you could live.
I gave you life,
so that you could live it.
Ma, the band needs
to be picked up at the airport.
The bride is awake.
Wait.
What is that?
Oh, my God.
Where did everybody go?
It's mosquito bite.
It's a zit.
- I have cover-up.
Hello, ladies, fresh baklava.
Give me the camera.
- Toula, help me. Come on.
No boys allowed.
- Nice moustache.
Thank you.
- Niko, let's go.
Is that my tux?
- This one.
Pick up the band at the airport.
- Okay.
What's that thing?
- A mosquito bite.
Put some Windex.
- I've got the cover-up.
You're all nuts.
- You should be at my house. Out.
Toula, I want to talk to you.
- Now?
This is a very special night
for you. You have your duties.
One more, one big one.
Hold on.
On my wedding night,
my mother said to me:
'Greek women
might be lambs in the kitchen...
but they're tigers in the bedroom. '
- Let that be the end of your speech.
What's going on? No-one's ready.
The photographer's here.
You need sponging?
_- I'm all right.
More on the top.
That's it. More hairspray.
She is ready.
I am a snow beast.
- No.
How do we know what's going on?
- It's all Greek to me.
This is it.
- What?
We take our first steps
as husband and wife.
Are you ready?
- I'm ready.
Where are you? Are you in there?
- Yes.
Don't dab. Wipe, wipe off.
- Is that better?
Who did your make-up?
Your aunts?
Drag queens could get
a few tips from those aunts.
Look at me. I'm just covered.
- Like a big frosted cupcake.
Come on,
help me with the veil.
Yes, you got it.
Do we have to go in?
- Too late to elope. Let's go in.
Let me check this out.
It's going down, thank God.
What?
- I woke up with a huge zip.
Where?
I had a huge zip this morning?
You did? Where?
- It was right here, it's gone now.
Why?
- I put some Windex on it.
Welcome to the Portokalos family...
and welcome the Miller family.
I was thinking last night,
the night before my daughter
was going to marry Ian Miller,
that the root of the word 'Miller'
is a Greek word.
It comes from the Greek word millo...
which means 'apple'.
So, there you go.
As you know, our name Portokalos
comes from the world portokali...
which means 'orange'.
So...
here tonight
we have apple and orange.
We're all different but in the end...
we're all fruits.
My wife and me, we have a gift.
- That's what our parents always do.
Here.
My God.
They bought us a house.
Thank you.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Voula, we're going to dance.
- Let me get Taki.
Athena, I'm going to be a painter.
- You can start with your fence.
This is really a nice wedding.
- Good. We'll dance now, come on.
I'll need some more ouzo for that.
- What do you say?
Bottoms up.
Let's go, Harry.
Taki.
He looks Greek.
Sometimes I'm afraid
that it didn't happen...
that I wake up buttering garlic bread
waiting for my life to start.
But it did happen.
And I figured out some stuff:
My family is big and loud but they're
my family. We fight and laugh...
roast lamb in the front yard.
And wherever I go, whatever I do,
they will always be there.
Ian and I moved into the house
my parents bought us...
I got pregnant, six years later
our daughter went to Greek school.
Mum, I want to go to Brownies.
- I know, but I promise you this:
You can marry anybody you want.
- Thanks, baby.
Greek school. Pame.
What does it mean?
Let's go.
- That's pretty good.
Looks good.
- Where are you going?
Greek school.
- Baklava.
