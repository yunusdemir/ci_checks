That was a very hot day...
Is your gun stolen?
Yes, I am sorry.
This is new constable Chun's gun.
How many cartridges?
- Seven.
- Is it pistols.
The stolen gun is pistols.
On the way home after exercise.
How many points?
Very poor, I didn't sleep when
I was on duty last night.
Were all missed?
One shot was on the tree.
Hurry to sleep, your eyes are red.
But all I see is yellow.
See you.
Chun looks very tired.
Moreover it is very hot.
The crowded bus made him dizzy.
The baby is crying.
The women's perfume is terrible.
I'm readt for any punishment.
Myself...
Don't be that, this is not a troop.
Leader, what should I do?
I can't just wait for punishment.
If I were you,
I would negotiate with the thief.
You are bad luck, asked to leave?
Probably.
Your leader is...?
Detective Chung.
Does he look fierce?
Although he looks fierce, he's good.
Hw will not fire you.
Please take a seat.
Can you remember the thief?
Check the suspects' information.
Check those theives of buses.
Anymore?
Age, sex, ways, everything is ready.
Found it?
Your leader is good.
He called me to help you.
How?
Can't find any.
The thief may not escape at once.
Sometimes he may pass it to friends.
Any suspects in the buses?
A woman of suit was next to me.
Where did she stand?
On the right of my gun pocket.
She looks suspectious.
Women can be bad.
Take the file of woman theives.
All are familiar.
This thief recently died.
Really?
Yes, it's her.
She?
Right.
She dressed suit?
Strange, Un is famous of
Japanese dressing.
Right, she got permed hair and
full of perfume smell.
She got permed hair? Time's changed.
Take all her files here.
Not necessary, I know her very well.
She steals wallets only, no guns.
She ought to be in bad luck.
Where is she?
I know where she is,
but she won't admit.
Just try our best.
Try our best?
Anyway bring us there.
Anyway?
The old man has fallen asleep.
He is 78 of age.
Will she come?
Once every day.
They are punctual on small things.
She thought she was a
regular customer here.
How?
Newspapers said robbery with guns.
Detectives shouldn't be surprised.
No, I am worried if it was my gun.
Haven't seen you for long.
Oh, it's Sze, I thought you died.
You are good at pleasing.
You look better than imagination.
What?
He said your suit made you look good.
Can you recognize him?
To this age, not interested in guys.
You really know how to pretend.
What did you say? I do not pretend.
What did you do on the bus?
Give me my gun, ignore the others.
What? Don't say that.
Please return my gun.
Just tell me where it is.
Help him, he's a new constable.
Don't hurt a good man.
Noisy, I sue you of Privacy.
You know what laws are.
I know quite a lot.
Know what?
See you.
Can't do anything to her.
I think it over.
However...
I follow her until she says.
Mind the place with two exits.
Don't follow me.
As long as you tell me.
You breach Privacy Law.
I have the right to walk.
It's up to you.
Just give me some hints.
What's time now?
It's 1 1:30 train.
Is he still there?
Still there.
Many mosquitoes outside,
I call him to come here.
He said he's coming here for
drinks, he refused to come.
I don't know insider information,
what about if you go to ask him?
Beer.
Don't drink.
I am not drinking.
Take it, you are hungry.
Take it, hurry.
I lost.
Eat, drink beer when it is cold.
I firstly want to...
I know, that's why I lost.
But I can only give some hints.
- Find the gun sellers.
- Gun sellers?
Illegal gun sellers.
The place to sell and hire guns.
Where is it?
I don't know.
Just walking in the center,
to pretend like a poor.
The gun sellers will come to you.
Can you let me go?
I am bad luck today.
The first time to be followed
by a constable for a whole day.
I am so tired.
Look, it is so beautiful.
I've forgot the beautiful stars
for 20 years.
Please introduce.
Got money? It is very expensive.
How many cartridges?
How much?
No over night?
Not calling prostitutes?
I want this one.
You got the wrong person.
Lier, my friend told me.
Get out or I call the police.
Why do you look down?
You are so strong, don't be down.
Do you want "gun"?
Don't pretend, I ask you
if you want any gun.
How much?
Where is the money from?
Show me the rice pass.
Rice pass?
Any deal?
Yes.
9 o'clock at the Restaurant.
Find the lady in white flower.
How about the rice pass?
What for?
I am a constable.
I am from the headquarter.
Let me ask him here.
It is very hot inside.
Metalic proof, like a oven at night.
Do you only sell this gun?
Almost every gun.
Any pistols?
What is that?
This size.
Like this.
Yes, leased yesterday.
When to be returned?
At the time after dealing with you.
When you arrested him, I saw him.
He was surprised.
Where is his rice pass? Take it out.
Are you a new person?
Get some advantages
when returning the gun.
And ask for more money.
I am not to ask.
So...?
The one behide you reading
newspapers is watching.
The rice pass is on his hands.
No hurry, thay have all gone.
Look at what? Hurry to catch me.
It is like a steamer here.
I won't be punished heavily.
You're serious about your pistols.
You should look at the gun sellers.
Shouldn't catch her now.
However...
The leased may not be your pistols.
There are many pistols.
There is a robbery with gun at Ting.
Now checking the cartridges
from the wound.
That also is a pistols.
Don't think so much.
Criminal detectives can be nervious.
You become skinny, walk a lot.
Youngsters should be harder.
Punishment report.
Salary cut for 3 months, rest today.
Exam. Dept., Firearms Research.
Check the cartridges in Ting's case?
It's mine.
There is no record of this cartridge.
Difficult to check without records.
Like finger prints,
cartridges also have prints.
How's that?
Find the previous cartridges.
Of the same kind?
Please exam.
Where do you get it from?
Please help.
Congratulations.
The same as in the case, look.
Thanks.
I am responsible for pistols lose,
I resign.
You resign?
Sorry.
Unfortune can train or kill people.
Are you willing to be destroyed?
See if you can change
the bad to good.
Why don't let the awards cover sins?
Unit Ho detective is in charge,
are you willing to join?
Yes.
Detective Geor is in Branch Ting.
You ring him up.
You check again the woman.
It may be helpful.
Yes, I am going.
Call number 18.
- Not here.
- Not here?
Someone from Ting is asking her.
In Room 4.
Thanks.
I am the first lesson Chun.
I was arrested by him.
- I am Geor.
- Detective Geor?
How?
I am asked to help you the case.
Please teach me.
It's OK.
The leased pistols...
I know, theives seldom use pistols.
What's the leasor look like?
Let me think.
He wore a winter suit.
Black one?
How do you know?
Left handed.
Really?
Smoke and think.
Yes, he used the left hand to light.
His hand is shaking.
I asked if he wanted to
commit suicide.
What's his name?
I don't know.
Lier, you have seen his rice pass.
Difficult words, can't read.
I hate studying.
Who got his rice pass?
I don't know, maybe Moo does?
No.
Who's that? You keep quiet
because he is your lover.
No, lier.
I am not lying.
He must be your guy.
He's Poon.
Just tell us everything.
Give me another one.
Where is his site?
I don't know.
Really don't know.
Why does he tell me?
Where does he go?
I don't know.
He loves playing balls, he should
go to the ball yards very often.
Has he committed any crime before?
He was in jail for two years.
When was it?
I don't know.
Good.
Let me finish smoking first.
It's bad to leave now.
You go to check Poon's record.
It may be a nick name,
but it should be in file.
Where do you go?
Which part do you feel good?
Detective Geor.
Got it, he's real name is Lip.
Print more photos,
have the warrant ready.
I don't know the current situation
and the search plan.
Catching the woman completes
half the job.
Catch Poon to get the rice pass,
and then list wanted the suspect.
Wore a winter suit,
with left handed pistols.
Shaking hands.
Fire although not necessary.
Fire although not suspectious.
The victims lose a lot.
Is it a woman?
Yes, robbed $ 40000 wedding money.
She needs to save for a few years.
Including her man it takes 10 years.
She cries and forgets the wound.
Because of that pistols.
How?
What?
That was my pistols.
Was stolen.
It's all my fault.
Use another gun for pistols.
I feel some bad things coming.
All have been arranged.
Hawkers also have the photos.
Thank you.
The ball games are good.
Coming again?
I am worried about something.
What's that?
What's that?
The criminal returned the pistols
before the robbery.
He saw me arrest the woman.
He may think I have his rice pass.
So he becomes hopeless to rob.
Do you feel responsible to him?
He hired the pistols
but not to rob on that night.
He hired but was afraid of using.
So he came to return the gun, but...
Minding the past is rather than
preventing the future.
He will use up the $40000 shortly.
Once he has used up the money...
He will do it again, more fierce.
Wild gads become mad dogs, right.
Catch Poon first.
He loves ball games,
he must come here today.
What's the capacity of the play yard?
50000.
Find the one from 50000?
Ice-cream, ice-cream.
Give me two.
Ice-cream, want any ice-cream?
Give me one.
Sorry, all are sold.
Why are you shouting for nothing?
Wait, difficulties start.
I go to catch.
Can you only see Poon?
Mind the watchers' safety.
Poon may have pistols,
cartridges are different from balls.
To induce him to leave and catch.
How to do...?
Use your brain, five rounds left.
Only three rounds left.
A lost child.
Shan's father,
your child is in the room.
Please come to take him.
Let's try.
Using the broadcasting to call Poon.
Mr poon please go to the main door.
Your friend is looking for you.
No response.
Try again.
Call the real name this time.
Mr Lip.
Your friend is looking for you
at the main door.
Hands up.
Rice pass, Yau.
Why Poon didn't destroy it?
Because Yau doesn't wear any gun.
He wants to use it later.
This is called Hard To Change.
Please check Yau's file.
Don't know when to catch him.
I really wish it rains.
Being too hot makes headache.
Let Geor and Chun follow.
So is Yau your brother?
How is he? He has not come
back for a week.
Nothing.
He changed
after retired from the army.
He lost everything on the way home.
Then he became bad.
All because of you.
Useless to say that.
He is angry with societies and wars.
Only blaming the country,
don't want to work.
He's got a bad friend.
A gangster always comes to see him.
Comb an ugly style.
It's all because of him.
Who is him?
He's Ching, his mate in the army.
Where is he?
I want to see his baggage.
All his baggage is in the fruit box.
He's kind but weak.
Go outside for fun.
He also sleeps here?
No, at the back.
At the back?
He used some wood to build a house.
Can I see it?
It's not like a room, very dirty.
I have so many children,
I have no time to look after him.
How's he before leaving?
Let me think...
On the day he left.
He didn't come to meals,
I went to look for him.
He's crying at the dark room.
I was frightened.
I couldn't sleep.
It seemed to hear the voice of
a wasted cat in the rain.
It was following me in the rain.
If it was suffered to death.
I'd rather kill it.
I had a sad feeling on my foot.
I was weak, like the cat.
Anyway...
Was it written by your brother?
Sakura Inn is...?
That bastard said he was the
manager of the Inn.
He should be lying.
Thanks.
Sakura Inn.
Welcome.
Where is the manager?
I am.
Is anyone called Ching?
He's a waiter, anything happened?
Is he always in trouble?
Since he's erotic.
I want to meet this erotic man.
- I call him.
- No, let's go together.
From the Police.
Does Green sue me?
She said she's willing to pay me.
Not Green's case.
Is it Fan's case?
She is...
I don't care about them.
I want to ask you about Yau.
We won't treat you like in the army.
Switch off the water tap.
Let me ask you.
When did you see Yau last time?
Saturday night, he was drunk to here.
Did he have money?
Dressed a new suit.
What suit?
White linen suit.
Come alone?
He's scared of women.
Not everyone is like you.
Stay over night?
How was his face?
The poor with money,
is it strange to say that?
You should have asked him.
He looked white and unanswered,
what has he committed to?
Do you make him bad?
No, who said that?
I only play with him.
What's the advantage of having
a poor friend?
We are friends.
Lying, do you have a friend of
no benefits?
What do you get from him?
He's active at the Theatre.
Women again?
You use him to be with prostitutes.
Yes.
How does the poor...?
Prostitute Chung is his friend.
Won't you come again?
The police for gangs will come.
Who is Chung?
The second one at the left.
Chung, why didn't you work yesterday?
I was not feeling well.
No one feels good with this weather.
Some police are looking for you.
Don't know what's going on.
Are you Chung?
Do you know Yau?
I know.
Are you a pair?
A pair?
A friend in childhood?
Just being neighbours for 6 months.
Better to be honest.
I am not lying.
Forget it, how are you guys?
Relationship.
For instance, like couple.
No.
Like film lovers?
Neither.
Does he come every day?
Since I know him, I won't refuse him.
I am not asking this.
When was the last time you saw him?
Just say.
I am thinking.
Still thinking?
How are you?
I am not doing something bad...
Reported to police already.
Ver tired.
Let's talk tomorrow.
So I am going.
Accompany me to another place.
Why did Chung cry?
She's tired, like us.
All because of me,
no patience when feeling tired.
Asking is an art.
Fail if meeting great opponents.
I want to see her again tomorrow.
Good,but it's difficult to ask more.
A sensitive woman like her
is stubborn.
Asking wrong thing is like a rock.
Where are we going?
Pa Pa.
Very hot.
Don't you call Uncle?
How are you Uncle?
I thought we came for cases.
Go in.
- Chun from the headquarter.
- Bothering you.
It is dirty here, please come in.
I remember some quota beer.
Very great.
Use the foot to squeeze.
So many pairs of shoes in 25 years.
Many memories.
Meeting different cases.
Nothing for you, pamkin?
This house is broken,
but Yau's house is worser.
not for man to live.
Catering worms.
There is no bad man, only bad place.
Yau is also poor.
A detective can't think it this way.
This feeling arises from
over attention.
Don't forget a wolf can hurt
so many sheeps.
When the police want to make sample.
The writers do the psycho analysis.
I only know to hate them.
I am not thinking this way.
I've seen wars make people
become barbarians in person.
Is it the age or time difference?
What's the words for "That Unit"?
"Post-war Unit".
Right, you are Post-war Unit,
so is Yau.
You know Yau very well.
Maybe.
My baggage's
also stolen in the train.
The time I was full of anger.
It was easy to be a robber.
Then I decided to be a police.
Therefore...
What you belong to...
Post-war Unit.
Right, but there are you and Yau's.
You are the proper one.
Yau is only a lazy Post-war Unit.
No, Is Post-war tortoise.
What to do tomorrow?
Don't hurry.
I'm worried if he has no money...
He at least spends half on clothing.
One week is over.
$6000 a day,
it is enough for us for 1 month.
I am going.
Really?
Tang.
Clients left.
The children just slept.
Asleep.
You come and look.
Like a pamkin farm.
It is said a robbery with gun.
She's a famous beautiful Miss.
The couple are very good.
Her husband just returned
from work this morning...
Today doesn't know tomorrow.
Is the one with flower.
The flower is not blessing.
You shouldn't have moved the corpse.
I'm her doctor, she refuses to say.
She must not be willing to let
others see the corpse.
I know her since childhood.
Is that my pistols?
What if it was your pistols?
How are you?
This tomato is grown by my wife.
The day I left was a good day.
Now it's become all red.
However she's dead.
What's going on?
Just for $50000.
How can I live with tomatoes?
I presume...
Presuming makes complication,
we want the facts.
Hey, I am Lui.
Exam. Dept.? Thanks.
Is it my cartridge?
No, it's Yau's.
Let's go, It's not time to think.
We must catch Yau.
He has five cartridges left.
Any news?
Where to go?
Go home and sleep.
Don't lie, why two of you go
home together?
Get away, what a hot day.
Where is the suspect?
Not coming on a cloudy day.
It seems coming tonight.
Who?
Who? I meant the sudden rain.
Police can't be nervious.
I am dying of weak nerve.
You look of weak nerve.
It is critical time now.
Murderers are like mad dogs.
Do mad dogs act with rhythms?
Some merits say.
Mad dogs move forward only.
Yau will only move forward.
He likes Chung, only her in his eyes.
He must go to see Chung.
The manager is not here,
I am from the Arts Dept.
We are looking for Chung.
She is on holiday.
She is troublesome.
Absence because of being scolded.
Pleased but stubborn.
She is just sick.
What's problem?
Menstruation comes.
She is in troubles when it comes.
Where does she live?
Should be the Temple.
With her mother.
I am looking for your daughter.
Here is fine.
No thanks.
Lend you the lighter.
It seems to rain.
I want to ask you one thing.
I don't know about Yau,
the police are fussy.
This child is...
Please don't bother, mother,
we have the right not to talk.
Do you think you have the right
to rescue a suspect of murder?
Don't know how to say?
Bull shit, he just left.
This lighter belongs to Yau.
Yes.
Did you say you hated him?
Where is he now?
Say it out.
Tell us everything you know.
Say I don't know?
I don't know.
You can't tell lies.
Chung...
Why don't you say? Just say.
Chung.
It's the time now.
Got no time to waste,
I go to this Inn.
How about me?
You stay here longer.
Mother is the best questioner.
Use the phone downstairs to talk.
Do you have a gun?
Yes.
I haven't brought.
No gun bag.
Yau just left, he won't come back.
You don't talk to mother either,
forget it.
You don't have a father,
you are bad of being beloved.
Forget it,
don't care about your mother.
About 27, 28 of age, in white suit.
Won't be a real name.
Pang? Hey...
It's him.
Is it him?
Stayed for two night,
full of acohol smell.
Haven't brought the documents,
drinking wines whole day.
Suddenly he called a taxi and left.
Which taxi?
Peact Taxi, the driver was Ah Chung.
Thanks.
Who is he?
Is a mad dog.
How long do you want me to suffer?
You make me suffer.
Incorrect.
I don't know what crimes he has
committed, but he's good to me.
He always unhappily looks at me
at the back.
I can't help you to arrest him.
You know where is he?
Probably.
Arresting him is your job,
but I can't help you.
This returns to you, let's go.
Suspect of murder?
No wonder he's easy-going.
Where did you send him to?
The Restaurant.
Thanks.
Where is it from?
Yau gave me.
When we were window shopping.
I said I wanted to dress this
beautiful clothes once.
He looked at me unhappily.
After 1 week,he sent me the clothes.
Chung, so you...
Yes, he committed crimes for me.
If I were brave enough,
I would steal it myself.
It's all because of the display.
We had no choice but to rob.
When he retired, his baggage was
stolen, so he became a robber.
Did Yau say that?
Yes.
Not only his was stolen, so was mine.
It is a bad society.
But it's bad to blame the society
and to behave bad.
Only bad guys are full, are winners.
You really think that?
So why aren't you bad?
Why don't you dress it up?
Dress, why not?
It is very hot, hard to dress.
Please.
Is wine.
For your thirsty.
Thanks.
How is he?
Came here at night, left in
the morning, then I don't know.
How about the prostitutes?
Yes, the prostitute sent him the way.
What's her name?
Is she Kam?
Yes, I couldn't find her just now.
A top prostitute?
Please check where she is.
Kam has gone for party.
Where?
Mod Restaurant.
I am happy.
I am really happy.
Like dreaming.
Mother.
Kam?
I am Kam.
Why doesn't Kam wear necklaces?
All wet, so say something for fun.
I want to ask you about the client
two days ago.
Two days ago?
That client was disguisting.
Why?
He was in black.
Must be something wrong.
You sent him to the way.
How come you know everything?
Where did he go then?
Where?
Went to the Inn?
You saw it.
Hurry to say.
Shantin's Inn, I...
You are stupid.
I'll ask her to say.
I may have said too much.
This case...
Yau's gun was stolen due to
my negligence.
He used my gun to hurt two already.
One of them is dead.
I believe something happen tonight.
You get all wet.
I am a police,
is anyone called Chung-fu?
2/F, Room 6.
Where is the telephone?
Here.
Don't say a police has come.
Only this exit?
There is the back door.
Locked?
- Not yet.
- Please lock it.
Don't let her cry.
However...
He's such a easy-going client,
it's a pity to be arrested.
Don't cry.
Look at the fat man, he's a cop.
If you come down,you'll send to jail.
Yes, emergency please.
Yes, Yes.
Call Chun.
Chun, listen carefully.
He's in Chung's room.
Looking for Chung? Good.
Not Chung, it is Chun.
Hello, looking for Chun.
Chung, your phone...
If it is Yau...
If it is him...
How to say?
Hello, I am Chung.
Detective Geor?
Detective, hello, detective.
Is it Yau's inn?
You should take a rest.
Don't bother me.
Donated how much blood?
Don't know.
Tell me, is it my cartridge?
Please tell me.
Tell me.
Detective Geor, don't die.
You can't die.
You have to be alive.
You have to be alive, don't die.
You come back again,
he's not in danger.
Mr Police.
Yau asked me to meet at 6 o'clock
at the Tai Yuen Station.
He telephoned here.
I'll also go.
No, only three cartridges left.
Shit, who's Yau?
Don't panic.
Calm down, calm down.
28 years of age, in white suit.
28 years of age, in white suit.
He may have change the suit, so...
Is a 28 years of age man.
Is a 28 years of age man.
Is a 28 years of age man.
Calm down.
Yes, he left in a rainy night.
Wears full of soil shoes...
Wears full of soil trousers,
full of soil...
Used to using the left hand.
The gun is given to Geor.
Congratulations,
Tao said you won an award.
All relied on you.
No...
What's your feeling to the award?
In fact it is caused by
my negligence...
Still blaming yourself?
It is benefits from mistakes.
Your case of a lost gun assisted
to discover more guns.
But Yau's thing makes me...
I used to have feeling.
The first catch is unforgetable.
But these men are more than
your expectation.
Catching more make you feel natural.
That prostitute is called...?
Is she Chung?
Yes, I also understand her feeling.
But you look outside the window.
There're many crimes under the proof.
Many goodies are hurt by
Yau-like persons.
Just forget Yau.
When you're recovered,
you'll be busy again.
You will forget Yau naturally.
