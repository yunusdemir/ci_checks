You move over, I'll take it.
Hey, this is Luke. This is my film.
Let me ask you a couple of questions.
Why do you dance?
Because it's like breathing.
It's like walking to me.
I'm not pretending.
When I dance, I don't pretend.
I'm more myself when I dance
than any other moment in the day.
I dance to become someone else.
There are so many things in this world
that want to push down on you.
But when you dance, you are free.
We started dancing at the age of seven,
in our house, in the living room.
Just dancing, copying Michael Jackson.
And I'm listening to the music
in the grocery store...
dancing through the aisles and stuff like that.
She's like, "Contain yourself. Calm down!"
And I'm like, "I can't stop.
I have to do it, I have to do it!"
After everybody went to sleep,
I would open the garage and just practice.
That's pretty much when I knew I loved it...
because I had never dedicated
so much time and effort...
into something like that.
It's not us just jumping around.
Dance has vocabulary.
- Inglewood.
- I'm from Argentina.
I am from northern Uganda.
- Miami, Florida.
- Koreatown, Los Angeles.
There's a lot of gangs and violence.
I couldn't be stuck there all my life.
My village was attacked.
My parents didn't even want me around anymore.
She actually kicked me out of the house.
- I had to go.
- Dance saved me.
Dance definitely saved me.
If it wasn't for dance, I don't know
what we would be doing right now.
I didn't have anything, I didn't have money.
I was living with 15 dollars a week
in New York City.
Dance brought us together, too.
All around the world, we're here.
Truth is, everybody's a dancer inside.
We all have a heartbeat.
We all have a rhythm inside.
What's that one thing you say?
Yeah, what do you call us?
Born from a boom box?
Yes!
Boom box! That's a pretty good one.
Born from a boom box.
It sounds stupid, but I do feel like that.
And if we listen hard enough...
we realize that maybe we're all
plugged into the same song.

New York University freshmen,
welcome to Washington Square Park.
It's the central hub of our urban campus.
Mom, Dad, you guys can really go.
No. We're gonna take you
and Camille out for dinner.
We promised her parents we'd feed her.
We're already paying for our meal plans.
It's all good.
We're fine. We really are, Mrs. A.
- We should go.
- All right. One last picture.
Okay. One last picture.
Get together. You're best friends.
You can drive a truck through you.
- We're close.
- Get closer.
- Put your arm around her.
- Okay.
Good boy. All right, ready?
Say, "Mom is pretty."
Mom is pretty.
Thank you! Ready?
Good. It's a picture of a hat.
I got a hat. With hair.
If my father could see me now
saying goodbye to my son...
the future engineer.
I'm just so happy you're done with
that dance business, I can't tell you.
Oh, but you have.
All right. You make me proud.
Okay. This is it.
Could I get in your backpack?
- Come on!
- That's too tight, Mom. Okay. All right.
Come on!
I'll make you proud
if I could just go to orientation.
You're my baby.
Everybody left already.
Okay.
I'll call you when I get to the dorm.
Wear deodorant. Every day.
- Come on.
- Okay, honey? It's important,
because you're a man now.
Come on, we gotta beat the traffic.
All right.
Wow, they really--
Are embarrassing.
I was gonna say, "love you."
Yo, Cam, check those out.
Those are the limited edition gunmetal Nike Dunks.
I know that look.
Okay, Moose, seriously,
next on the tour, Union Square.
I just want to get a closer look.
I'm gonna be right back, okay?
Cover me.
I guess.
All right. Let's go. Who you got? Who you got?
Yo, I want 25 on Kid Darkness.
Twenty-five on Darkness. Whatcha got?
Give my money. Give my money.
Snap! Did you see that?
Nice hat, homie.
Yo, I want 10 on the skinny kid.
Give me 20. Give me 20!
Give me that 20!
Yo, you see that?
Yo, it's over, it's over. That's it. Go home.
Come on, new kid, get in there!
Let's go, tourist.
Come on, let's see what you got!
You give this kid to Kid Darkness like that?
He ain't got no flava!
Yo, look at the kid!
He moves pretty good for a geek.
Buddy, that kid is real!
Been holding out.
I didn't know that dude could dance like that.
Let's go, new kid, let's see what you got.
Who's going to pay for my balloons?
He's right here! Get this guy.
Stop! Police!
Hold it right there.
Come on, man. They're after you.
Let's go. Come on!
We need backup, southwest corner of the park.
Come on, let's go.
All right, time out, time out. I can't--
We don't have time for that. Come on.
Freeze!
Stop! Hey, get out of the way!
What are you doing?
Jump first, fear later.
Whoa!
- Step aside!
- Move out of the way!
Excuse me.
Out of the way, folks. Stop!
My ribcage.
I have to tell you, I just threw up in my mouth.
It's burning.
Where you going?
Yo, how did you just do that back there?
You were like freaking flying, man.
You're like a ninja.
It's Luke.
No, it's like this. You gotta blow it up.
How is that?
All right.
I'm Robert Alexander the Third, by the way.
Just since you asked.
But you can just call me Moose.
I haven't seen you around.
I'm just starting at NYU.
I'm actually an engineering major.
But you're going to be dancing, too?
No, no. Not anymore. I mean,
dancing was cool in high school...
but it's time for me to face the real world.
You really have no idea
what you did back there, do you?
You're B-FAB.
What's a B-FAB?
Born from a boom box.
Some people learn to dance others are born to.
And you're in New York City,
the dance center of the world.
Check this.

It's the biggest battle ever.
There's never been this kind of prize money.
And those guys in the park,
they're gearing up for this.
You're good enough. You should be in this.
That's your car?
Oh, my God, that's so sick.
Get in.
What you saw in the park today
is just the beginning.
This is it.
What the heck is this place?
Come on.
Welcome to my house.
The House of Pirates.
Nice place.
It's a little small to live in.
My parents converted this place years ago.
We all live and train upstairs
and run a club downstairs to make ends meet.
It's kind of like our secret hideout.
All right, this is it.
We call this the Vault.
Around here, dance is your identity.
We live together, work together, battle together.
But unlike other crews,
we all have different styles.
I found all these guys out in the city.
Crazy talent, but no place to go.
We've become kind of a pseudo-family here...
where we can be ourselves and rules don't apply.
This place is off the chain.
Thing One and Thing Two over there,
that's the Santiago twins.
You, man, you.
We saw you dancing at the park
this morning. You were...
- Amazing.
- You were great.
- You are from another planet.
- Your own planet.
Your own world. You're just amazing, man.
- I have a question for you--
- No...
- guys, come on. No questions.
- I got it,
I got it. Got it! Come on.
You're great!
Luke.
Jacob. What's up, brother?
- Chilling.
- Meet Moose.
Pleased to meet you, Moose.
This guy right here,
he's the captain of the ship.
More like the first mate.
I heard you did some impressive work
in the park today.
How does everybody know that?
News travels fast when you
beat someone like Kid Darkness.
But, Luke, I need to borrow you for one second.
- We've got some things--
- Can we wait?
I gotta show him around.
We'll take him.
Come on, let us show him around.
- I don't know about that, guys.
- Come on, please?
- You can trust us.
- What would Jesus do?
All right. Don't hurt him.
- Promise.
- Moose,
these are the Ticks. Good luck.
All right. Let's show him around!
This came from the bank today.
We're six months late on our payments.
We paid them last month.
And what about the other five?
We're working on it.
The club's not making the money it used to.
I guess the bank doesn't want to hear that.
They want the money, and if they don't get it...
they're going to put
the Vault up for public auction.
Listen, don't I always have a plan?
This kid, Moose, he beat Kid Darkness today.
And he did it with style.
With a little bit of training,
this kid could be the spark that we need...
to get everyone together and win
the hundred grand from the World Jam...
and pay back what we owe.
Look, Jacob, we're not gonna
lose the Vault, all right?
We won't let that happen.
You don't understand,
nobody ever smoked Kid Darkness
and got it on tape.
That was serious.
You're the man!
You think the Samurais are
just going to let you go like that?
They'll find you and they'll battle you again.
The Sama-who?
The House of Samurai.
The most cutthroat house in the city.
- Our fiercest rival.
- Yeah!
What do you mean they're gonna find me?
They've got technology out there now.
Like the bears with the GPS inside?
Watch out, they're right behind you!
That's enough.
Don't let them freak you out, man.
You're with us now.
And nobody messes with us. Not even the Samurai.
Not unless you wanna get roasted.
Unless they want to get a big patada in their...
traste.
What in the--
Okay, you don't get it,
but I know what I'm saying.
Yeah.
She's back.
The one I've been telling you about.
Hey, Moose, come on.
I'll show you around the club downstairs.
Party pooper!
Come on, Luke.
Come on. This way.
What? What?
Watch out, they bite.
It's crazy, right? Hang out, take a look around.
I'll be back in a second.
Nobody battles a Samurai just once.
Now it's time for the real battle.
What? Now you're scared?
Where do you think you're going?
This ain't over yet.
They say he's cool, man.
Let's see something else right here
Get him, Baba! Get him!
Go get him, get him.
I just want a few rounds with the kid.
We got some unfinished business, me and you.
You wanna get to him? You got to go through us.
Come on, Luke.
Be a good sport.
What are you doing here, Julien?
Nice to see you, too.
I mean it. Get your boys and get off our property.
Your property?
It's not gonna be your property for much longer.
And don't worry, when I buy this place,
I'll take good care of it.
When we win the World Jam,
you and your trust fund won't be able to touch us.
That's cute. Your boy can't
even finish his battles.
Bubbles and balloons?
- That's so amateur.
- Enough, man.
He will finish it
at the World Jam and so will we.
I don't even know what you just said.
Stop being disrespectful to my crew.
Get off!
Come on, I'll get you out of here.
Get off her, man!

Are you okay?
Yeah.
Thank you.
I'm Luke.
I'm Natalie.
So, what's with the bags?
Supposed to be meeting my friend here,
but I guess she's a no-show.
What are you going to do?
I don't know. I haven't figured that out yet.
You can stay here.
What, in the club?
No, I mean, upstairs in the living room.
You don't even know me.
Yeah, I do. Your name is Natalie
and you need a place to sleep.
Okay. Sure. Thank you.
Okay. Grab your stuff.
You sure they won't mind?
Everyone here knows what it's like to be a nomad.
So, where you from?
Here.
But I've been living in London
the last few years.
Wow.
Well, this place will be a departure.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So, you ready?
For bed?
No, for the battle. The World Jam?
We could really use someone like you.
You up for a little competition?
It's what I live for.
Been competing my whole life.
And do you win?
I never lose.
Good.
Then I'll see you in the morning.
We got a lot of work to do.
Moose...
where were you yesterday? I thought we had plans.
I know, I know, I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Sorry? I had to eat dinner with my freakazoid
roommate who smells so badly.
And she would not stop yammering
about her pet rat's blog.
Wait a minute, we should hook
our roommates up together.
Mine looks like a pet rat.
He's got the nose and everything.
He's got the claws.
There you go!
Now, I need you to help me
find this engineering lab.
Moose.
What?

What would I do without you?
I don't know. I really don't.
Later, gator.
I see you've found the speaker room.
Yeah.
Built this myself when we could actually
find boom boxes in the city.
Impressive.
You're up early.
Already warmed up.
Good. Because you're my new recruit.
And it's my responsibility
to get you up to speed.
Then let's train.
No, no, no. We're not training here.
Okay. Then where?
Out there.
Just try to keep up.
Before we divide up into lab groups and begin
the work, I want to talk to you about...
what engineering means to me.
What's your name?
And what, hopefully,
engineering will come to mean to you.
Silence. That's my name.
Silence during class.
Second of all--
Go answer it, Mr. Popular.

What?
Open up the cages, boys.
Let's show these newbies
why we call this the Vault.
Okay.
Hey, Moose boy.
How are you, my friend?
What a beautiful senorita.
Nice to meet you.
Can I give two?
Come on. Come on.
- Are you gonna get mad at me?
- I'm not gonna get mad at you.
I'm just saying hi to her.
Let me introduce myself. I'm introducing myself.
Okay, but you're stopping
when I'm introducing myself...
- ...to this beautiful senorita.
- Okay. Don't listen to him.
You're so cute.
- Okay. Got it, got it.
- Okay.
You're cute.
Ladies and gentlemen, our most prized possessions.
Check it out.
If dance is our weapon, then this is our armor.
These are the most beautiful shoes in the world.
The way they smell, the way they feel.
Hey, you're sounding like a girl.
I know you love shoes,
but you're like, "I love these shoes."
No, you gotta say, "I love these shoes."
Like a macho man.
- Okay, bro.
- But don't touch me.
Luke's lucky shoes?
Smart boy.
All right, Moose, don't get too attached.
You gotta earn your kicks in this house.
And beyond door number two, the graffiti room.
What?
- Who's that guy?
- That? That's Jason.
He's our graffiti guru.
I'm talking electronic billboard hacks,
LED lights, anything to mark...
- who we are.
- Dudes!
Excellent timing.
Listen, I have been working on
the portable light-tagging system...
and I can't figure out how to get it
to stick to 12-volt batteries--
You got any electrical tape?
Yeah. Here you go.
All right, check this out. Tape it right there.
Wrap it around, and it creates a snug fit.
You know lights?
Yeah, I dabble. Just check it out.
Yeah! Yes! I love this kid.
It's the LED to the battery to the magnet.
They're beautiful. Like neon fireflies.
Or neo flies.
Yeah, neo flies.
Neo flies. I like it.
Oh, Moose!
Cool. Check it out.
Yeah, for sure we can do something with this.
Listen up. World Jam is right around the corner...
but to get there, we gotta get through
the two qualifying rounds.
Which means...
Which means, we got a lot of work cut out for us.
Moose, Natalie, you guys in?
I don't know, I mean,
I have to go to school. I can't just--
We'll figure something out.
Pirates. Pirates. Pirates
- Moose.
- Pirates.
I could do one battle, guys.
All right, all right. Natalie?
To the House of Pirates!
I'm more of myself when I dance than
any other moment in the day.
I dance to become someone else.
You know, they always think that
we are just a bunch of kids...
with no direction.
But what we do is very hard.
We make it look easy.
You spin, and your equilibrium is off,
and you stand up.
And all you have to rely on is
how well you know your body...
and when you place your two feet on the floor,
finding your horizon within yourself.
- Wow.
- Hey.
This is quite the setup.
Thanks. I collect footage of dancers
who inspire me.
Clearly.
What are you going to do with it all?
I don't know, nothing.
I just play around with it.
Check this out.
I dance... I dance. Become someone else.
We were born from a boom box.
I had no idea.
They're amazing, aren't they?
I mean you.
You're a filmmaker.
What's wrong?
Nothing, I usually don't show people this stuff.
It's just me.
All right.
You'll show me?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Promise not to laugh.
- I promise.
...or something like that. But it's another thing
for that thing to choose you.
Wait, wait, jitterbug, booty shake.
Yes.
Okay, okay, okay.
This is our teacher in fifth grade.
- Face-lift.
- Yes.
What?
Go, go. What are you-- Okay. Raptor!
- Yes!
- Yes.
Oh, God!
Wait, wait, wait.
How do you guys even do that?
Me and Camille, we can read each other's minds.
You guys are so cute.
How long have you guys been dating?
No, no, no. It's not like that.
We're just friends.
No, correction, everyone, we're best friends.
Anyway, sorry guys, I have to go. I'm in a rush.
Wait, you're leaving?
- I'm gonna call you later. All right?
- We just started.
Have fun.
You guys lost.
Whatever.
Okay.
Wow. It's so obvious.
It makes so much sense now.
What?
You're totally in love with him, aren't you?
- No.
- Yes.
No, no, no.
It's not like that. We're just...
one of those-- We grew up together.
No, no, that would be really weird.
I think it's your turn.
- Ready?
- Yeah, you're up.
You're up.
- Okay.
- Okay, you go first.
Squirrel? Kangaroo?
Keep trying-
Look who's up early now.
Actually, I haven't been to sleep yet.
Can I join you?
Sure.
What you looking at?
I come out here to listen.
The river, the traffic, the birds.
Make me feel like I'm a part of something bigger.
Traffic makes you feel like
you're a part of something bigger?
That is deep.
Like I said, I've been up all night.
I've been thinking about your video...
from last night.
I think you should finish it.
And you should show it to people.
Yeah, I don't know about that.
Clearly you love it, right?
Look at you. You've been up
all night and you're...
I don't know, you're glowing or something.
Glowing?
I see a glow.
We should get to Red Hook.
You're right.

Welcome to Red Hook!
The first round of World Jam!
Are you all ready for a battle?
Red Hook, are you ready?
Pirates, you ready?
Let's get it!
And the winner is...
The Pirates!
The Pirates are now into the next round...
of the World Jam!
Pirates! Pirates! Pirates!
- No, no, no.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Now it's time for you to be
in front of the camera, my good-looking Pirate.
Yeah. Do you want some makeup, baby?
So, Captain Luke-
- Give me the camera.
- No, no, no.
It's not that easy on this side.
It's uncomfortable.
Yeah, why don't you keep walking.
Look at this guy.
What do you love about dance?
I don't know.
Dance, music, it's just
always been there for me, I guess.
Is that it?
What?
I know you can do better than that. Come on.
All right.
My parents used to be dancers...
and they started this place for people like them...
but they didn't just wanna be back-up dancers.
You know, do their own thing,
build their own respect.
I thought that was cool,
so I wanted to carry on the tradition,
in my own way.
But for them, you know?
What do they think of you turning this place
into a madhouse?
They never got to see it.
I'm so sorry.
No, don't be. It's okay.
So that's why you're so devoted to this place?
Carrying on what your parents wanted?
Family is family.
The Vault used to be
their life and now it's mine.
It's amazing what we do for family, sometimes.
So, tell me about your parents.
They split up a while back.
And me and my older brother...
we were sort of the dice that
got rolled between them.
Where's your brother now?
We're still close.
I mean, he pretty much raised me.
So, I owe him everything.
So, Tarantino...
are you planning on blackmailing us
with all that footage?
No, just you.
All right, so...
I'm sorry for being late, okay? I won't--
I'm so sorry.
I thought you were somebody else, I'm sorry.
Okay.
Do you know that trick when they take--Really?
They kind of look alike. I think they're twins,
but it's just a thought.
Camille?
What's going on? I thought we had lunch.
Is it lunch time?
Wow, we got so carried away with the costumes,
I totally lost track of time.
Costumes? For what?
It's for the dorm Halloween party.
People plan their costumes all semester.
All right. So, what are we going to go as?
Well, actually, I tried calling you,
but you didn't pick up...
so Kristin and I are going to be the Olsen twins.
Wait, wait, wait. Kristin?
Kristin?
Camille, Kristin?
What about Moose?
Go ahead, you guys.
You haven't exactly been around lately.
I mean, I couldn't wait forever.
Okay, well, hey.
I'm here now.
Come on. What do you say?
You know you're gonna have
way more fun with me than...
Kristin.
Are you asking me to the dance?
Camillian...
you know that I was born to
be the Ashley to your Mary Kate.
Really?
Yes, really.
Okay, okay. Fine, I'll cancel with Kristin.
Yes.
I'll see you later.
- Guess I'll see you later, then.
- Okay.
Get back to your friend.
Hey! Kristin, in your face.
Bye.
Okay, you gotta stop complaining.
Well, I'm sorry, I just feel ridiculous
holding this giant cup.
Whoever said it was okay to have
small, medium, large and then ginormous?
Hey, look.
- That's you.
- What are you talking about?
- This guy looks exactly like you.
- No, he doesn't.
He's got a camera popping out of his head.
He's got the pretty little cheekbones.
It does not look anything like me...
and I would not be caught dead
with those culture vultures.
I've seen your work, you don't fool me.
Yeah, it's just for fun,
it's nothing professional.
Well, what if the Pirates
and the rivalry didn't exist?
Wouldn't you give your filmmaking a shot?
That film academy sounds amazing.
Yeah, but it's not an option,
so I don't think about it.
The World Jam's our main focus.
Okay, so tell me, then. How do you do it?
Do what?
Get all your amazing footage?
I don't know. I just try to see things that
people don't normally see.
You show me?
All right, come here.
Where are you taking me?
Just trust me. Come on.
Hurry UP-
All right.
Wow.
Just wait for it.
For what?
What? What?
Watch this.
How did you do that? I want to do it. Okay.
- Try it.
- Okay.
See that? I did it.
There's Slurpee everywhere.
Oh, my God, my straw! I lost my straw!
I think it was just...
being in my living room,
and me and my brother were just...
playing around together and I always tried...
to match him.
Moose.
Yo. Hey, what time is the battle again?
Eight o'clock. Why?
- You ready for it?
- Eight o'clock?
It all goes down at Chinatown.
This is the house of Gwai.
They're champions of Asia,
so I hope you're prepared.
Hey, we've got a problem.
No problems, man. This is round two,
you gotta be there.
We can't have any missing links or
we could get eliminated from the World Jam.
I know, I know. I have a test
on the same exact day.
I don't know if I can--
Listen, we need you.
Do whatever you can to make it work.
All right.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you
how much this test counts.
This is worth 25% of your grade.
Take your time.
You may begin.



Yo, where's Moose at?
I don't know, man.
I'll go get a towel. I'll be right back.
Where you been, bro?
You just ruined the floor.
It's over.
At World Jam!
"Hit me with your best shot"
"Why don't you hit me with your best shot"
"Hit me with your best shot"
"Fire away"
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, sure.
- Alone?
- Yeah, yeah. Hold on.

Yo, hold up. Cut the music.
Cut the music. You guys need to see this.
What's going on, bro?
- What is this?
- It's our entire routine.
- Why is it online?
- I can't believe that...
they know our whole set.
Wait a minute, who would do that?
Julien and the Samurai.
How could they get our rehearsal footage?
Does everyone have their DVDs?
- Yeah, man.
- You have the DVD?
- I put them in the room.
- Are you sure?
We're still in this, all right?
We just got to figure something out.
Okay, you see there?
If you could just let go of that spin,
we can land this thing.
Those guys may have our tapes,
but that won't stop us.
Trust me.
Luke, I don't know.
Maybe somebody else should do it.
If we pull this off, we'll kill it onstage.
Julien won't know what hit him.
Whatever happened between you two?
Me and Julien?
He used to be a Pirate.
We used to be best friends back in the day,
but as time went on, things changed.
How do you mean, he changed?
We found out he had a gambling problem.
He wound up in bad debts, so desperate that
he bet against our own house.
And threw the battle to win the bet.
He threw a battle to win a bet?
The whole house was devastated...
so we had to kick him out.
He's been trying to take us down ever since.
The crazy thing is, if we don't win the World Jam,
he could actually do it.
Hey. Welcome home.
You lied to me.
You told me Luke kicked you out
because he was jealous.
But it wasn't that, was it?
You threw a battle for a bet?
- Natalie--
- Don't.
I went in there for you, Julien.
I can't believe you stole that
DVD and put it online.
What are you talking about?
What kind of BS did he say about me now?
Luke was jealous! He wanted to be
the leader so he kicked me out.
He used me and he kicked me out!
I'm sorry.
We have to stick together,
Natalie, you know that.
I don't like to be lied to.
I just want our house to
win the World Jam. Okay?
We have too much in this, we've worked too hard.
Well, despite what Mom and Dad say,
it doesn't always have to be about winning.
You're starting to sound like him.
You need to check yourself and
remember whose side you're on.
Friggin' ridiculous.
Luke isn't some monster. He's a good guy.
He takes care of the people he loves.
Who are you gonna believe? Him or your family?
You're gonna talk to me about family?
When Luke isn't even related to any
of those dancers he would never lie to them.
I'm a liar? What about you?
How do you think your precious Luke...
is gonna feel when he finds out that
you have been playing him?
Actually, now that I think of it...
you should come clean.
That might be just what I need to
throw his game off for World Jam.
Thanks, sis. You really helped me.
I'm not putting him out on the streets
over some stupid rivalry.
I will not be part of it.
Jacob, you scared me.
You don't seem like a girl that's easily scared.
Tell Luke I'm sorry.
You have a choice, you know.
It's not that easy.
The most important decisions
in life are never easy.
Dance can reveal a lot about a person.
The way they move, they way they learn new steps.
I mean, if you're dancing for real...
it comes from the most truthful part of your soul.
I dance to express how I feel inside...
whether it's anger, happiness, loneliness-
Once I found the Vault, it was like coming home.
This is where I feel safe. This is where I belong.
This is where my family is.
This place is pretty special. It's our world.
Finally, I had somewhere I could be myself.
People say that you don't really
choose your family. We did.
If you are one of us, Luke will find you.

Luke“.
Why would she just leave like this?
I don't know, but for the moment
we've got bigger problems than that.
The bank has put our house up for auction.
- What?
- They're selling it.

All right, look,
I'm gonna deal with this, all right?
- What the hell, Walt?
- Hey, Luke, how are you?
Sit down.
I don't want to sit down.
Look, I understand how hard this must be.
If you can just wait a few days,
we'll have the money.
You're five months behind on your mortgage.
Unless you can catch up with your payments...
I'm afraid there's nothing more I can do for you.
The warehouse sits on prime property...
and the bank is well aware
of what it's gonna go for at auction.
I need more time.
I'll see if I can get them to
suspend the foreclosure...
but don't get your hopes up.
They could take your warehouse today.
That's not going to happen,
because it's not for sale.

Look what I just got from Natalie.
What does it mean?
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
Come with me.
- Me?
- Yeah. I need you.
I have a Halloween party tonight. I mean,
I would but I can't miss it.
College parties start late.
I'll get you back in time, I promise.
I'm supposed to be Ashley Olsen, man.
Ashley Olsen?
Yeah. You know how long
it takes to straighten this hair?
Come on, you're my boy.
It's been a long day, man.
I need a good friend right now.
All right, I got your back.
Invitations, please.
Invitations? I got one on my cell phone.
No invite, no entry.
Can you guys push off, please?
Look, my name is right there.
- Jeff Bernstein. Just check.
- No.
- You know what?
- ...Bernstein.
Thank you.
Hey, how you doing tonight?
I'm sorry about that.
There's got to be another way.
Let's go.
And now, the broken tango.
Take it away.
Look at this place, Moose. Come on.
Where are you going? Luke. Luke!
- Luke.
- Hey. I got you.
Come with me. Come on.

Hey, Camille, we're all ready for
the party.You coming?
I'm gonna meet you guys there.
Moose will be here any minute.
Get your giddy up, girl!
I got something for you.

I hope you like it.
Your film?
- You did it?
- Yeah.
Luke.
So happy you finished it.
Let's get out of here.
No one can see us. We're fine.
No, I mean, let's leave.
We can go anywhere. California, even.
Come on, you can go to film school.
We can start fresh.
Luke“.
I'm so glad you made it.
You know, I was a little concerned
that you wouldn't get the invitation in time.
What are you doing here?
Julien. You invited him.
What? I just wanted to invite him to
come celebrate the birthday...
of my amazing and lovely sister.
He's joking, right?
I'm so sorry.
Sorry? This was all a lie, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.
- Shut up, Julien.
Why? It was.
Listen, at first it was and then...
I got to know you, okay? And I--
I started to fall for you and that was real.
That's why I had to leave.
I'm so sorry. Please, tell me you believe me.
Don't touch me.
Luke. You...
Natalie, you don't need to deal with--
Don't, Julien.
Don't worry about him, he's a loser.
Are you really getting mad about that?
Camille.
Camille, I thought that you--
I'm over it. You clearly have better things to do.
No, no. Camille, it's not like that.
Come on, I got caught up.
Great. Thanks.
I've been dancing.
Before school, during school and after.
So, you've been lying to me and
ditching me for some secret life?
You could have at least told me.
But, I guess I'm not important enough
in your new, cool life to know.
I should have just told you, I know.
But I'm sorry, okay?
And it's all over now.
You're right. It's over now.
Luke. Luke? Luke?
What the hell? This is bullshit.
We tried to stop them, man,
but there's nothing we could do.
We've got to get in there.
They can't do this to us!
- Luke, Luke.
- What the fuck?
Hey.
I grabbed as much as I could.
It's Julien.
Julien's trying to buy the house.
Yo, so what are we gonna do now?
Can't you see? We're finished.
But, the World Jam. It's just around the corner.
But if we have nowhere to rehearse--
We have nowhere to sleep, yo.
We're fooling ourselves
thinking this place was gonna last.
I'm out.
Anyone else?
Hey, it's not your fault. Julien started this.
You guys deserve better than this.
There's nothing more I can do. I screwed up.
The Pirates are done!
We tried.

Hi.
Hi.
So, on a scale of one to 10...
how much do you hate me?
I don't hate you, Moose.
I miss you.
And what's worse? Feeling like
you don't miss me at all.
I don't even matter to you anymore.
We spent all senior year talking about NYU.
The real world, facing it together.
What changed?
You're my best friend in the whole, wide world.
And I never wanna let that go.
My mom just sent this in the mail.

Wow, that's priceless.
Cam...
I'm sorry.
I miss dancing, but...
I'm going to have to say I miss you more.
Really?
Really, really.
You hear that?
- What?
- Do you hear that?
- What?
- Come here.
What?
- Listen, listen.
- What?
Are you serious? No. Back of the line.
Just one second, little girl. One moment.
Excuse me, can you turn that song up a little bit?
What do I look like, a jukebox to you, pal?
How about five bucks?
Give me that. I'll be right back.
MSA freshman year! We met...
to this song!
This is ridiculous.
You remember the choreography, right?
- And step forward. Come on, let's try it.
- No, not a chance.
- Are you serious?
- Dance with him. Please.
Go.
You heard the kid. Come on.
All right.
"I won't dance"
- Moose, stop.
- "Don't ask me"
- Oh, my gosh.
- "I won't dance"
"Don't ask me"
- Not in public, please.
- "I won't dance"
- "Madame with you"
- I'm sorry.
- "My heart won't let my feet..."
- I'm not doing this.
Moose?
"You know what? You're lovely"
- Give me my hat back!
- "You're lovely."
"But, oh, what you do to me"
What are you doing? Get out of here!
Man. You know what? I'm gonna squirt you.
- You get! Get! Get--
- Watch out!
- Get out of here!
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Kids! Come on, come on!
Come on, come on! Give me your scooter, kid.
Hey, that's my scooter.
You dented it, you freak!
Why, thank you.
Oh, my gosh, you have leaves all over you.
Wow.
You can never give it up.
You were born to dance.
Give it up. You suck!
Really?
Don't listen to them.
I know, but you gave it up.
Yeah, 'cause I'm not like you.
I'm a good dancer but,
Moose, you're a great dancer.
My parents gave up everything.
So you wouldn't have to. I know, I know.
We can figure this out...
together.
Okay.
Okay.
Come on. Do you like my new hat?
Hey, Vince, I need a coffee on table eight.
Everything all right?
Excuse me, what do I have to do to
get a menu around here?
- What are you doing here?
- I have two things to say to you.
I'll have an egg salad sandwich, toasted rye...
and I still think we can win the World Jam
and get the house back.
I'm out of egg salad sandwich and
you're out of your mind.
I thought that's why you liked me.
Yeah, but you're still crazy,
because we have nobody left.
But I'm here.
Means we got one back.
Luke, you're the only one...
that can get everybody back together
to save your house.
The Pirates just need your leadership, that's it.
They don't need me.
I took what my parents gave me and threw it away.
You really don't know what you've done.
You gave these people a place to live out their dreams
and be who they really are.
- Sit down, man.
- Dude, I got tables to work.
No, no. Just take a seat.
This better be quick.
You never asked me why I love to dance.
Do you wanna know why?
I dance because dance can change things.
One move can set a whole
generation free, like Elvis.
One move can make you believe
like you're something more.
Remember this one?
Moose, sit down before you make a foolm
out of both of us.
And some moves...
can give a skinny, curly-haired kid...
that just wants to dance...
some hope.
Hope that he's actually special.
Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello.
Coffee. Decaf, don't want it. Regular?
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't do regular.
I tried, it's just not me.
I've been waiting here for
30 minutes for Christ's sake!
Hey! He can't do regular, the man said.
Yeah, great, Fred Astaire. I didn't pay for a floor show,
I paid for some coffee.
Okay, that's cool, but how are
we gonna get everyone together--
I had to get everybody here somehow, man.
Man, did I miss you guys.
And my mornings are way too quiet
without you guys yapping.
You see? I told you he would miss us.
Okay, okay. You're right.
Look, I know the odds are against us.
We have no house, no routine.
Hell, I don't even know
how we're going to do this.
But I believe in us and I know you do, too.
That's what I'm talking about.
But we've come way too far to stop now.
I know we can win this.
Pirates. We be the Pirates.
We be the Pirates. We be the Pirates.
But we still don't have a place to rehearse.
Don't worry about it.
Moose says he found us a place.

Kido.
What's up?
I miss you.
I miss you. Come here, give me a hug.
Guys, hey, this is Kido.
We used to dance together in high school.
Am I missing something?
What do these games have to do with the World Jam?
You said you needed space, right?
I got you, brother.
Brother?
Come on.
Nice to meet you.
Come on. This way. Watch your step.
You're gonna like this place.
Just come.
- See, I told you.
- Oh, no.
Okay, I like it, man.
I used to love this game when I was little.
Who do they belong to?
Me. Yeah, I watch them after school
because their parents work here.
I don't know, guys.
Do you think this is going to work?
There's so much junk.
There's no room and we barely have any dancers.
Yeah, and the Samurai,
they outnumber us two to one.
He has a point.
Hold that thought.
Come on.
Oh, my God! MSA crew. Long time, no see!
Kido! You ruined our slow-motion thing!
Sorry.
Guys, I thought we might need some extra dancers.
Pirates, meet the MSA crew.
Let's show them what we got.
A highly good idea, Kido.
So first up we got--
We got a floor master...Monster.
Yeah, that's tight.
We got Cable, the man with no bones.
Fly. Fly can groove and shake.
The popping tapper, Hair.
And last but not least,
Smiles, ladies and gentlemen.
All right, guys, I think this is gonna work.
"Work"? We gonna kick some ass.
Will we win the World Jam?
You may have--
Hey.
Hey,yo, Zoltar.
Hey, machine.
Yo, give me my money back, man.
Hey, guys, check this out.
This is what I've been working on
for the World Jam.
Imagine these lights on this shirt.
That didn't work.

Champion. Game over.
I like your dance moves.
I like your accent.
You like my accent? That's good, I like yours.
I don't have an accent.

Carlos...
I knew you would come back.
Yo, we need you, man.
- You need me?
- Yeah.
Well, check this out. Got a message from Julien.
What are you talking about?
I've been training with the Samurais.
- What?
They wanna offer you a deal.
Is this a joke?
You want the house back?
You can have it back, free and clear.
What's the catch?
Throw the battle.
- Throw the battle.
- Yeah.
Can't you see?
I'm trying to give y'all a chance to
have what you want.
Man, how could you do this?
This is real life, Luke.
When you gonna wake your ass up and see that?
It's time to grow up.
The Samurai will win at any cost.
You need to leave, now.
Think about it. The offer stands.
Or you could take your chances at the battle.

What's up, everybody?
My name is Grandmaster Caz and
I'd like to welcome you...
to the biggest dance battle on planet Earth.
Ladies and gentlemen...
this is the World Jam!
Let's go!
Coming up next, our main event...
the World Jam Championship matchup.
The House of Pirates versus The House of Samurai.
And this battle is the battle you won't forget.
Stick around.
Yeah, baby!
Yes! Are you all excited?
Luke.
I'm so sorry.
I know I lied to you...
but everything we had was real.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I'm taking a train to California.
And I wouldn't have the courage to
do that without you.
I know you have dreams, too.
This is crazy...
but come with me.
What makes you think I would trust you again?
Because that person that I was only with you...
that's who I really am.
Right about now, Pirates to the stage!
Let's hear it for the Pirates, ya'll!
Luke.
Good luck today.
Here they come. Here they come.
Here come the Pirates.
They look determined. They look ready.
But is it enough to upset the mighty Samurai?
Only time will tell.
Samurai to the stage.
And here they come, in the
black and gold, the Samurai.
Looks like they mean serious business!
Let's go!
Pirates, come on. First round, there it is.
Here come the Samurai.
Let's see what they're working with, people.
No way.
This looks personal.
I'm feeling that.
That's old school. That's old school!
Oh, my God! It's a freak show out there, people!
Look, ma! No hands.
This is a massacre, people.
Samurai's wiping up the floor with these guys.
It looks like it's over.
It looks like it's over, people.
Hey.
We can take them.
You said so yourself, we're not ready.
You can trust me.
It looks like it's over!
There's no way the Pirates
can come back from this.
Oh, what's this? The Pirates are answering back.
Get off the stage.
Get off me, Julien.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait!
- Stop it!
- Stop it. Hey, hey!
- What are you doing?
You can't do this, you're a Samurai.
- Not anymore.
- What happened to family?
This is my family, Julien.
Get off me.
Let's get back to business, people.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about
Oh, no, here she comes! Go, go, go!
Perfect landing, baby.
I give that a 10. I give that a 10!
All right, y'all. Let's go.
What are they doing? What are they trying now?
It ain't over yet.
Are you kidding me?
You can't get those shoes at Foot Locker, people.
It's getting tribal in here.
Now, here's the Pirate shorties.
Oh, my!
Boom! In your face!
That's it, that's it. It's a wrap.
And both of our finalists did their thing.
But now, it's time for our judges to decide...
who's going home with this $100,000.
Judges, are you ready with your decision?
Whose flag are you going to raise?
Black and gold for the Samurai,
or red and black, for the Pirates?
Pirates! There it is!
Oh, my God! The House of Pirates are
the winners of the first annual World Jam!
It's over! $100,000...
to The House of Pirates!

Dear Luke, your film was so great,
I had to share it.
I hope you give yourself
the chance to live your dream.
Love, Natalie.

You can go to her if you want to.
I will take care of everything until you get back.
You gave us the chance to live our dreams...
and now it is time for you to
go and live your dreams.
There it is!

The winners of the first annual World Jam...
is The House of Pirates!
Some famous guy once said,
"To travel is better than to arrive."
I was like, "What?"
Because I used to think that there is only...
one path to take to
where you want to get to be in life.
But if you choose that one path it doesn't mean
you have to abandon all the other ones.
I realized that it's actually
what happens along the way that counts.
The stumbles...
and the falls and the friendships.
It's the journey...
not the destination.
You just have to, I guess,
trust that the future...
will work itself out like it's supposed to.
I guess I'm asking the school to
go freestyle with me, here.
But I'm ready to jump.
What you're asking for is a double major...
in Engineering...
and Dance.
Yeah.
Well, it's certainly a first.

So?
Yeah, I--
I'm a double major, so--
No way, Moose! Oh, my gosh!
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
What do you mean you can't believe it?
Cam, thank you for being there.
You're welcome.
May I have your attention, please?
Westbound train 745 to Los Angeles.
Final destination, Los Angeles will be
departing in 15 minutes from track eight.
Bronx-bound 34 to Bainbridge
will be departing in 15 minutes.
What happened? Did you forget something?
I think you forgot to say goodbye.
- Don't leave me, please.
- No, don't leave me, please.
No, no, no.
Senorita, please. Senorita. Come to Buenos Aires.
Don't listen to him.
Listen, listen! I kissed your hand remember?
- Yeah, so what?
- It was me.
I'm going to miss you guys.
I'll miss you, too.
Give me hug, give me a hug, please.
Come on, don't cry. Don't cry.
Where's Luke?
He's going hard.
All right, all right.
Hey!
Crazy. Don't listen to them, okay?
Okay.
Can I kiss somebody right now?
Hang on a second, okay? I'll be right back.
This is for you, man.
I'll see you soon. Blow it up.
You're B-FAB. Remember that.
Take care of the house, guys.
Open it.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Let's go party, people.
Yeah.
