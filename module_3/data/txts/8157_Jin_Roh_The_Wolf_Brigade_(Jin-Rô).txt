This thing is like a wolf
This thing is a wolf
Thus, it is a thing to be banished
A decade after the Great Defeat...
...our nation finally emerged
from the chaos...
...and confusion of
occupation rule.
Although successful, a policy
of aggressive economic growth...
...aimed at rebuilding the nation
and rejoining the world...
...also led to serious social unrest
and economic hardship for many.
The massive unemployment and
urban migration that resulted...
...turned large areas of
the cities into slums...
...the breeding grounds
of soaring violent crime.
More ominous was the rise of
armed anti-government groups...
...bent on changing
society through force.
These groups grew so powerful
that local police authorities...
...were overwhelmed, raising
serious concerns for public safety.
To avoid violating the
new constitution...
...which restricts the use
of the Self-Defense Forces...
...and to keep local police forces
from forming a national power...
...the government chose
an alternate path.
With its activities limited
to the Capital...
...a new paramilitary force
was established...
...under the direct command of
the National Security Committee.
This was the birth of the
Capital Police Organization...
...or the Capital Police.
Highly mobile and heavily armed...
...the Capital Police quickly
expanded its power...
...and declared itself
the guardian of public order.
However, facing bans and other
legal restrictions...
...the enemy anti-government forces...
...were forced underground
as they split up and regrouped.
In the end...
...a single guerrilla group
known as "the Sect" emerged...
...and the situation was
changed dramatically.
Increasingly violent clashes
between The Sect and the core...
..."Special Unit" of the
Capital Police...
...often turned city streets
into urban war zones.
This led to a backlash of
enraged public opinion.
As society began to look
toward the future and...
...the economic prosperity
it promised...
...the Special Unit and its
enemy, The Sect...
...were becoming
increasingly marginalized.
The Special Unit,
once known as "Kerberos"...
...for their armor and weaponry...
...tirelessly fought long
and hard for the nation.
As they were about to
join the pages of history...
...the changing times
were about to...
...give them a new and final mission.
Jin-Roh - The Wolf Brigade
Take this, ya dirty pigs!
This is the Police.
Disperse immediately!
Airborne patrol unit,
Hoishrech 12 reporting.
About 3,000 demonstrators
occupying Akasaka Crossing No. 4.
Riot situation in progress.
Proceed with caution.
Repeat.
About 3,000 demonstrators
occupying Akasaka Crossing No. 4.
Riot in progress.
Medics! Hurry!
That's no regular Molotov!
How did they get those in here,
anyway?
Where was site security?
Taking a nap?!
The special Molotov cocktails.
We've got lots.
Give 'em hell.
Just got word the Shibuya
group's working its way here.
Be ready for them.
A gift for your Granny.
Take it.
Pull the line back!
Move trucks forward!
Get the water cannons over here!
Concentrate water forward...
...keep them from getting
in range of our men!
Received urgent report
from Unit 2 en route to Shibuya.
About 2,000 rioters that were
headed for Yoyogi Park...
...shifted course.
They're now headed this way!
Don't let them link up.
Deploy C Battalion
and barricade...
...Three-Points Crossing!
It's an obvious diversion.
Without that backup battalion...
...once the protestors
break through...
...they'll have no choice
but to retreat.
And what if the 2,000
protestors link up with them?
Like oil on fire.
Look.
Watch it burn.
There's magnesium or
napalm jelly in those Molotovs.
You think they're Sect members?
It's possible.
But they're still no more
than a mob.
If we fire, they'll scatter
with the first assault.
Nice if they could grab
a few of those guys.
But if they take their time, they'll
lose the effect of that first assault.
Shall we step in?
Our co-policing arrangement
with the local police...
...doesn't make us
the authority here.
Let's wait and see for now.
Here's your present.
Treat it gently and use it well.
Medic! Hurry!
That's a satchel charge!
Arrest them all!
Charge!
You're under arrest!
Pull back three blocks.
Hurry.
Go on up ahead.
Get yourself to Three-Points.
Let's go.
Drop them and go up.
Drop your weapons
and give yourselves up!
Don't.
Why?
What are you doing, Fuse?!
Shoot!
What the...?
And?
How badly was he hurt?
It went off right in front of him.
You'd think he'd at least
be seriously injured.
Thanks to his protective gear, only
bruises and a minor concussion.
That's what they say.
Anyway, about last night.
That's what I'm here to
discuss with you.
Is this another protest
from the local police?
Need I remind you we
had a co-policing agreement.
They're saying this was
a serious violation.
Why didn't you
notify them first?
And run the risk of having
the information leaked?
To act like that under
their very noses...
...without regard for their
jurisdiction, and then this.
It's no surprise they're
going to be upset.
Listen, Aniya.
Let's end this ludicrous
co-policing arrangement.
Besides, we're like
water and oil.
Put the two together...
...and we wind up on top
floating like filthy grease.
If we did do that...
...well, think about the situation
we're in right now.
There are people who
can't wait to bring us down.
They couldn't be more pleased that
your Special Unit botched this.
You're now a perfect
target for them.
That may be so.
But, in battle, you have to accept
that things can go wrong.
These guys know that.
They're just making noise.
That's if the explosion was
inevitable, or even an accident.
What do you mean by that,
Muroto?
The problem isn't that the Special
Unit acted outside its jurisdiction.
The issue is that we weren't
able to contain the situation.
And we allowed that
guerrilla bomb to go off.
Tell me, Handa...
What was his name again?
Constable Kazuki Fuse.
Since completing his basic
training in September...
...he's been attached
to a strike platoon.
It might have been too much
for a rookie to handle.
The terrorist who blew
herself up was a minor.
A girl, no less.
It's an old trick of theirs
to use women and children...
...to transport guns
and explosives.
The ones you in Public Security
call "Little Red Riding Hoods"?
Fact is, we're not dealing with
petty criminals...
...or cheap thugs acting
out their brutality.
These are people who have
an extreme commitment...
...to their cause and are
willing to do anything...
...no matter how vicious
and underhanded.
And they don't see themselves
as the criminals they are.
That's what we're dealing with.
That goes without saying.
Whatever may have happened...
...a man broke under pressure
and must take responsibility.
Now...
...the specifics of this incident
and the issue of punishment...
...is a matter to be taken up by
the Internal Board of Inquiry.
All right?
Make sure it's all done
through proper channels..
What do you mean?
Perhaps it's nothing.
But I've heard rumors...
...about a rogue organization
within the Special Unit.
Don't be stupid.
The "Wolf Brigade"?
Well. I'm sure it's nothing
more than a rumor.
Better be more careful
with what you say.
Aniya.
It's all right.
I'll leave it to you.
We failed to give the police
their advance notice...
...but they'll be able to save
face if we punish somebody.
From now on, be more careful.
Well...
I'll send someone with you.
There're terrorists out there
to get people like us nowadays.
No. I'll pass.
A Special Unit escort will
make it more conspicuous.
I suppose.
Could you have my car
brought around the back?
State your name and unit.
Constable Kazuki Fuse...
...attached to Strike Platoon 3,
Second Company...
...Special Armored Brigade
of the Patrol Division.
What was the nature of your
assignment on February 9th?
Based on information
that guerrillas were...
...operating underground
in the downtown area...
...we received a deployment
order to move out at 2200.
With us were 2nd Company
Platoons 6 and 7...
...along with 1st Company Strike
Platoons 1 and 2 and Platoon 5.
We entered at ramp G-13 and
proceeded to Trunk-Line 23.
With respect to your deployment...
...what orders did your
commander give you?
To prevent the use of the tunnels
for storage and transport...
...of weapons and munitions.
We were also told that should we
encounter enemy forces...
...we were to engage
and eliminate them.
What was the situation in the
tunnel during this mission?
Twenty minutes after
we entered the tunnel...
...Platoon 1, which had
advanced ahead of us...
...engaged an enemy guerrilla unit.
Accompanied by Platoon 6,
we rushed to give support.
Who did you encounter
as you made your way there?
Why?
Why?
Why didn't you shoot?
I don't know.
Constable Fuse.
You shall be released from
your current assignment...
...and shall report to the Academy
for re-training until further notice.
Dismissed!
Hey, how about
mah-jong tonight?
Again? You sure you got
any money left?
Come on.
But Kishida's outta commission.
We'll need another player.
Hey, we'll get Murayama.
All right.
The one who loses pays
the bar tab tomorrow night.
I guess that'll be you.
You know very well...
...that the Chief's permission
is required if I'm to...
...release any material relating
to the Division's findings...
...and that Chief Muroto's the one
most against the Special Unit.
Just meeting you,
even in a public place...
...could put me in front
of the Board of Inquiry.
I'm sorry.
Don't sweat it.
To them I'm just a Special Unit
flunky from the Academy.
No point in sucking up to
Public Security now.
Besides, I'm doing this
as a favor...
...to my only real friend
from the Academy.
We managed to get some
information from a survivor.
Seems they had a tough time
identifying the girl.
There wasn't much of her
body left to go on.
So...
...what do you plan on doing?
She blew herself up
in front of you.
It's not like I don't understand
how you feel.
But it's crazy to blame
yourself for her death.
Don't feel responsible for it.
There's a logic these people follow...
...which we'll never
be able to understand.
It leads them to do things
like kill people...
...and sometimes
even themselves.
It's just as we have our own logic.
If the situation had been
slightly different...
...it might've been you
that got blown apart.
I actually meant to shoot.
I actually meant to shoot her.
Then why didn't you
pull the trigger?
Just forget it.
If you let your emotions take over,
you can't do this kind of work.
A wounded animal with no way
to survive isn't going to make it.
Her name was Nanami Agawa,
code named "Kurzes Haar".
Joined the People's Democratic
Movement in high school.
Suspended twice, then expelled.
Six months later...
...she joined the Sect through
an urban anti-war cell...
...and was assigned
to their supply unit...
...known as the
Jacobson Organization...
...where she began her career
as a terrorist.
On February 9th...
...she was with the Anti-
Lebensraum unit...
...fighting in the United
Popular Front protests.
She was cornered by the
Special Unit in Trunk-Line 23.
She detonated the satchel charge
she was carrying...
...blowing herself up
and dying instantly.
No previous arrest record.
If you're from the organization
please leave immediately.
She's gone from this world
and is no longer of any use to you.
No... No, I'm...
Thank you so much.
That's all right.
Agawa Family
Why don't you blame me?
You were both
doing your jobs.
It wasn't your fault.
Besides, they say you
chose not to shoot.
It's not that I'm not sad about it.
I suppose it just hasn't sunk in yet.
She was my only sister,
and we got along.
I guess there was something that
made us a little different, though.
She was pure, and always
very straightforward.
That made her stubborn, too.
She never listened to anyone.
But I always felt our mother
liked her a lot more than me.
I always felt it wasn't
fair being the older sister.
I was going to put this
in her vault with her ashes.
I'll give it to you instead.
Why me?
I'm really not sure.
Why not? You keep it.
But...
I bet that feels good.
This river goes to the sea, right?
And the sea stretches far,
far away to other seas.
Goggles, check.
Regulator, check.
This feels strange.
Yeah. Your body feels so light,
but there's no field of vision.
Like being a deep-sea diver.
Can the talk!
Commencing exercise!
"Once upon a time,
there was a little girl...
...who hadn't seen her mother
in seven years."
"She was forced to dress
in iron clothes...
...and was told...
'When you wear out those clothes,
you can go back to your mother."'
"The girl rubbed her
clothes on the wall...
...trying desperately
to tear them."
"When they had finally
been torn...
...she got some milk and bread...
...as well as a little
cheese and butter...
...and set out for
her mother's house."
"In the woods,
she met a wolf...
...who asked her what
she was carrying."
"'Milk and bread...
...and a little cheese and
butter,' she answered."
"When the wolf asked for some...
...the girl said no, saying it
was a present for her mother."
"The wolf asked whether
she'd be taking the path of pins...
...or the path of needles."
"When the girl said she was
going to take the path of pins...
...the wolf hurried off
down the path of needles...
...and ate up the
little girl's mother."
"The girl finally reached
her mother's house."
"'Mother, open the door,'
she said."
"'Push on the door.
It's not locked'...
...answered the wolf."
Exercise complete.
Four dead, two disabled.
You idiot.
You'd been warned about
it well in advance!
You all knew the limitations
of the night vision goggles!
Did you know where you were?!
What the situation
in the room was?!
Anticipate what might be
behind the door?!
It was because you were
sloppy in securing the area...
...that you weren't able to
react to sudden changes!
You, there.
Give me the rundown
on the protect gear.
How about you then?!
The protect gear's...
...capability can only
be maximized when...
...one has learned
its blind spots...
...and is able to effectively
cover others in the unit.
If you knew that,
then what happened?!
One mistake by any one of you...
...can get everyone killed!
Don't rely too much
on your equipment!
Use your head!
Well? What do you think?
About what?
What do you think about Fuse?
Why didn't he shoot?
You use rubber bullets here
instead of paint pellets.
That creates a situation where
you'd rather shoot than be shot.
You use these so that
they remember it...
...not just with their minds
but with their bodies, right?
Even with the gear on,
the pain cuts into the bone.
When I first got hit with one,
I couldn't sleep from the pain.
Isn't that why you
transferred to Public Security?
I suppose it just means
he's human too after all.
Perhaps.
No matter how much pain
they have to endure...
...there are those who find
comfort in living as beasts.
You think he's like that?
Well, we'll keep trying
until we figure it out.
You sure are a strange one,
Henmi.
You dump your friends
in the Special Unit...
...and go off to the
Public Security Division
Yet here you are back again
all worried about some...
...dropout from the Special Unit.
An instructor who takes
on a guy like that...
...seems pretty strange, too.
Think there's a girl?
What?
Our boy Fuse.
He's been going out
a lot recently.
Have you heard anything?
No.
In any case...
...tales of beasts getting
involved with humans...
...always end badly.
Beasts have their own
tales to weave.
We'll do another penetration
exercise in 10 minutes!
We'll keep doing it until
at least half of you survive!
Hey, see that corner?
I'm trying to think of
what was there before.
You remember?
I guess that's how it goes.
It doesn't take long
for us to forget.
Or maybe we just never
noticed in the first place.
If a building can disappear
in a single day...
...it's like it was never there.
It's kind of like when people die.
Isn't that sad?
When I was little, I was...
...often brought to this place.
But, it seemed so
much bigger then.
Oh, yeah.
Come on.
Look. You can see a long
way from here, can't you?
Yeah.
When I stand here I start
to think that someday...
...I�ll get out of this city
and never come back.
I'll go where no
one knows me.
I can be someone else.
Someone else?
Yeah.
I'll forget about all
that's happened...
...and become a different person.
Why did you join the Special Unit?
It's hard for me to explain.
But it was like...
...I finally found a place
where I belonged.
An important place?
I think so.
I see. So you found your place.
Are you okay, little boy?
There it goes.
Are you hurt?
You can't come.
Wait!
I want to ask you something!
You can't come with me.
You know it's not allowed.
Hey!
No, stop!
No!
No!
Hello?
Yes.
Yes.
So...
...what happened to the girl who
took the path of pins to go home?
"'Push the door. It's not locked'
answered the wolf."
"But the door still wouldn't open."
"So the girl crept in through
a hole into the house."
"'I'm very hungry, Mother,'
she said."
"'Have some meat in the cupboard,'
answered the wolf."
"It was the flesh of her
mother killed by the wolf."
"A big cat jumped up
onto the cupboard and said...
'That's your mother's flesh
you're eating."'
"'Mother...
...there's a cat on the cupboard...
...and it's saying that
I'm eating your flesh."'
"'That's a lie, of course."'
"'Throw a shoe at the cat."'
"The little girl, having eaten
the meat, was thirsty."
"'Mother, I'm thirsty.' she said."
"'Drink some wine from the pot,'
answered the wolf."
"When she did,
a little bird came flying...
...and perched onto
the chimney stack."
"'That's your mother's blood
you're drinking."'
"'You're drinking your
mother's blood,' it said."
"'Mother, there's a bird
perched on the chimney stack...
...and it's saying that
I'm drinking your blood."'
"'Throw your cloak at the bird."'
"Having eaten the meat
and drunk the blood...
...the little girl turned
to her mother and said...
'Mother, I'm feeling
very sleepy."'
"'Come over here
and get some rest."'
...Well, then?
Have you given any thought to it?
You realize we're taking
a big risk here.
Local police officials
meeting secretly...
...with Capital Police
people like this.
It certainly wouldn't look good.
I'll say this, though.
All of us here think differently...
...from the people
at headquarters...
...who want to bury the
entire Capital Police.
Leaving aside the problems
relating to its foundation...
...we recognize that over the past
several years the Capital Police...
...has effectively
carried out its role.
And we recognize that the work
of the Public Security Division...
...which you founded, has been
successful in many respects.
I want to stress that we
think highly of...
...your Capital Police
Public Security Division.
While public order and peace
are returning to the capital...
...the anti-government forces
are still too powerful to ignore.
The fact that they've been...
...able to build up considerable
organizational strength...
...is obvious by how prevalent
their terrorism is.
We're facing a rapidly
changing situation out there.
We must steer away from
armed confrontations...
...and quickly begin focusing...
...on counter-intelligence
to maintain public order.
To do that, we urgently
need to establish...
...a unified organization under
a single chain of command.
Those at General Command
bent on destroying...
...the Capital Police
don't understand that!
There aren't many at headquarters
who see things our way.
However, our strength lies in
the growing number among...
...the rank and file committed
to preserving law and order.
So, with your
Public Security Division...
...combined with Chief Aniya's
political connections...
...we can integrate ourselves
with the Capital Police
...and thus reform our internal
structures completely.
Though not official...
...we have some support on the
National Security Committee too.
But on one condition.
No more Special Unit?
What do you think?
A pathetic bunch who're
nothing but talk.
One glance from
Internal Affairs...
...and they'll scurry off with
tails between their legs.
Those National Security folks
probably offered support...
...just to keep Local Police HQ
under their control.
Yes, you could be right.
But you have to admit those men
have pretty good instincts.
Fact is, you can't put two
breeds of dogs in one cage.
But if you need the bloodlines
of both...
...you can mate them.
It's a bit of a gamble as you can
never tell which will dominate.
No matter how strong
the bloodline...
...it will eventually die out if the
dog is not able to pass it on.
Apparently some animals...
...kill all the offspring of the
other males under them.
...when they dominate a group.
Sometimes organizations
do the same.
You're betraying
a good friend from the Unit.
Doesn't it bother you?
Who's the girl?
A "Red Riding Hood"
like the one that died.
Her name is Kei Amamiya,
code-name "Langes Haar".
Arrested a few times...
...but no convictions.
A dyed-in-the-wool terrorist.
Section 1 turned her over
to us after she confessed.
Why did you choose her?
The right background.
But primarily it was her uncanny
resemblance to the other girl.
Pick your time.
By the way...
...have you heard about a group
called the "Wolf Brigade"?
I believe...
...it's a counter-intelligence unit
that Deputy Chief Handa set up.
I'm told they have moles...
...in the Special Unit of course,
but also at Capital Police HQ.
Do you think such a group
really exists?
It's hard to say.
But during the Occupation,
Handa did set up...
...some counter-intelligence
for G-2.
You can never tell exactly
what he's thinking.
Just keep that in mind
and watch your back.
A forbidden romance...
...between a terrorist and
a member of the Special Unit.
My division chief
isn't very subtle, is he?
Should be a good scandal, though.
It'll do the job.
What are you thinking?
The wolf has always been
the villain in every tale he's in.
No, you're not betraying
a human being.
It looks like they're
about to move on it.
Are you sure we can trust him?
Once a beast, always a beast.
"The girl undressed and
approached the bed...
...where her mother lay...
...in a strange position
with a hood over her face."
"'Mother...
...what big ears you have,'
she said."
"'All the better to
hear you with, my dear."'
"'Mother...
...what big eyes you have."'
"'All the better to see you with,
my dear."'
"'Mother...
...what big claws you have."'
"'All the better to hold you with,
my dear."'
"'Mother...
...what big teeth you have."'
Quite impressive.
Though it doesn't mean much
in the heat of the moment...
...if you can't pull the trigger.
Is that right?
Aren't you worried about
the Board of Inquiry?
I'm ready for it.
What's wrong?
I mean, we didn't quite finish
our talk the other day.
There was actually something
more I wanted to say.
But I'll let it go.
Is it about me?
It seems some people
are watching you.
But I don't know the details.
Me?
Well, I'll find out what
I can do about it.
If you notice anything, let me know.
All right?
Sure, I'll do that.
Fuse...
Be careful.
Hello?
It's me.
Some strange men have been
following me since last night.
Please. Can you meet me?
I'm at...
Zero one, to zero three
and zero four.
The prey has entered our trap.
Don't kill him.
We want him alive.
He's on the first floor!
Secure the front!
Don't let him get away!
Is that a...?
They don't trust me enough
to give me a real one.
But you've really got to
hand it to them...
...for choosing the museum
at night to stage a bomb transfer.
Pretty dramatic, don't you think?
If it becomes known that
one of the people arrested...
...is a member
of the Special Unit...
...the media will be
all over it like flies.
It's the Local Police that
put on the show.
But it was written by the Capital
Police Public Security Division.
And the director is Henmi?
You came even though you knew?
Why's that?
Let's go.
There they are!
Alert the guys up front.
Just get in the car.
It's them!
Shoot them!
It seems they got away.
He took the girl...
...and he even stole
one of the cars.
Present location unknown.
The entire Local Police Patrol
Division has been mobilized.
...but who knows if
that'll catch them.
Maybe it was too much
for those guys.
I didn't realize he was so talented.
He does have emotional problems.
But in shooting, stalking,
hand-to-hand combat...
...and other techniques,
he has remarkable abilities.
I'm sure I told you that.
Get some guys from the Tactical
Assault Team and get on it.
Good thing we took out
some insurance on all this.
Henmi...
What if that man's a Wolf?
I'll shoot him.
Before he has a chance
to tear out my throat.
I'm nothing like him at all.
The fugitives are a male
and a female. They are armed.
Shoot on sight. Repeat.
The fugitives are a male
and a female...
Aren't you going to run?
Thank you, sir.
Still checking vehicles.
No sign of them yet.
Driver's license, please.
Where do we go now?
A dark forest.
Where do we go after we
get through the dark forest?
A house where someone awaits.
Who's waiting?
Mother?
Grandma?
Or...?
I want to go back
to that place again.
What's goin' on here.
What're all these cops doin' here?
Hey. Come with me.
Hey! What're ya doin' to me?!
I'm a taxpayer, ya know!
Let me go!
You don't ask anything, do you?
It was all lies from the start.
That girl who died
wasn't my sister.
We didn't meet by chance.
It was all planned.
I was a Red Riding Hood.
Like her.
After I was arrested...
...I was taken to the Capital Police
Public Security Division.
I didn't care anymore by then.
I agreed to everything
they asked me to do.
In a way it almost
seemed comforting.
It became such a chore
having to think.
I thought it best not to think
about anything...
...or so I told myself.
But, when I'm with you...
...I somehow feel like
I'm hurting myself.
When I see the same sadness
in you, I start to dream.
I wonder why.
How about we...
No. Never mind.
How about we take off?
Far away, you and me?
Like, some place where
no one will know us.
Well? Why don't we?
Huh?
That's not possible.
There are things
I still have to do here.
But if we stay, we'll be...
Sorry.
It's cold.
We've kept Fuse under watch
ever since he was...
...put in front of that
Board of Inquiry.
From the time you first
made contact with him...
...we've looked into all
there is to know about you.
Then...
We let you do what you wanted
without interference.
That's what counter-intelligence
is all about.
The side that anticipates the other
and strikes first has the advantage.
They wanted to bring down
the Special Unit.
And they chose him
as their sacrificial lamb.
But they're the ones
who have fallen into a trap.
They're the ones who'll have a
scandal blowing up in their faces.
They have much to fear.
Not us.
As long as you forever
remain a card in our hands...
...the Public Security Division
can't ever lay a finger...
...on the Special Unit.
At least for a while.
I suppose if I were them,
I'd take out a little insurance, too.
After all...
...I�m the one who first
taught Henmi that old trick.
Now you know.
Not only is the man you see here
a member of the Special Unit...
...but he has also been
a part of our group.
That's right.
Ever since I trained him when
he was a recruit at the Academy.
So. You mean, all along...
Is it true?
And now you're able to
see the real Fuse.
We're not men disguised
as mere dogs.
We are wolves...
...disguised as men.
Wolves...
Not men...
All Right. Go!
The hunters kill the wolves
in the end...
...only in the tales humans tell.
What else could I do?!
What choice did I have?!
You know I wanted
to go with you!
You know I did!
But you were the one who couldn't!
If only we could've...
If only we could've
both died together...
...then we would've...
Then we would've
been with each other.
At least I know I would
have had...
...a place in your heart.
That's all I wanted.
I wanted...
...someone to remember me.
It's an ambush. Get back!
There's more of them!
This way!
This way.
So it was true, Fuse.
You knew what to do all along...
without being told.
Take this!
Why?
Why didn't you...
...shoot that time?
What's the difference, anyway?
Between you and me?
Aren't you...
...human, after all?!
Fuse!
Isn't she our ace card against
the Public Security Division?
What's important...
...is that they believe
we have her in our hands.
So, whether she's
alive or not doesn't matter.
Then, why?
There's only one way
to ensure that the...
...other side never gets her back...
...and is never able to
confirm her death.
Listen.
The only way for her to
stay alive for our purposes is...
...for her to die here.
She should understand
this very well...
...considering the company
she kept.
Do you want to leave the pack
and live amongst the humans?
But, you know...
...even if a wolf takes the guise
of a man and lives among them...
...he can never be human.
Just as the crimes of that girl,
who carried the bombs...
...and took the lives of many,
cannot be erased.
What should I...?
You want me to tell you
what you should do?
This is where you end the tale
of a beast involved with a human.
End it all now while you're
still a beast.
"The girl undressed
and approached the bed...
...where her mother lay...
...in a strange position
with a hood over her face."
"'Mother...
What big ears you have,'
she said."
"'Mother...
What big eyes you have."'
"'Mother...
What big claws you have."'
"'Mother!
What big teeth you have!"'
And then the wolf...
...ate up Little Red Riding Hood.
