"What if there was such a

together and be buddies!

their minds enough...

Woo!
Emmet, you didn't let
me finish earlier.
Because I died.
The reason I made
up the prophecy...
was because I knew that
whoever found the Piece...
could become The Special.
Because the only thing anyone
needs to be special...
is to believe that you can be.
I know that sounds like a
cat poster, but it's true.
Look at what you did when you
believed you were special.
You just need to
believe it some more.

believe that I'm special...
