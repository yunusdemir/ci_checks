Your road is long...

It is long and empty...

Lyrics by Yuly Kim
Performed by Larisa Dolina,
Andrey Mironov, Mikhail Boyarsky
Oh prairie, oh prairie,
The distance is great,
The Indian feathers,
The steel of the Brits.
The price is absurd,
But the payment is hard.
The principal thing
Is to keep my hat on.
But I value in some sense
The thing that is kept in my
hat.
That's how it goes!
You ride fast, you die young,
You ride slow, you never come.
So live and don't chicken out.
Let it all go it's way,
And you'll get what happens next.
- The Black Jack Gang!
- You'll get it, Jack!
Go, move it!
Why don't you shoot, God damn
you?
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, you!
- I don't have a weapon.
- Did you come here without one?
- I didn't come to kill.
- Then you'll get killed.
I don't get it, how can you read
in such a minute?
Aren't you scared?
What one has a purpose in life,
one is not afraid of death.
You weren't expected, sir.
Sammy, don't you want to greet
me?
I greeted you the last time
around.
Go!
Let's say good-bye then.
Well, Jack...
Don't worry, ma'am. I'll just
have a look.
Oh, such a leg...
What a leg!
10 to 1, sir,
you're clutching your Bible with
both hands.
For me, it's rather the Holy
Writ.
- Preparing for a better life?
- I wish you the same.
I'm not in a hurry and I don't
hurry you.
Careful, this is the world
history of cinema.
- He doesn't seem to see well.
- But I can hear well.
I have to admit, grammar isn't
my element,
but even I can discern that some
pages are empty.
It's the place for history, sir.
Dare it, and your name might be
written there.
- They wait for their heroes.
- You say funny things, sir.
I wish I could listen to you
some other time.
When I sent my 1st dozen to hell,
my mommy told me, "Jack, if
you're guilty of something, it's
only that you haven't met a good
man in life".
Sign it here. You took 50 grand
from us.
It was 40, Andy.
I can count, you know.
No insurance company would trust
my receipt.
Only if you don't negotiate it
with its president first.
Money loves everyone.
Remember it, gentlemen,
this country will be ruined by
the corruption.
Have a good day, sir.
Who knows, our paths might still
cross.
I'd be glad if they do.
- Our mommy has come!
- Oh my little birdies!
Mommy's here!
Why did you marry me?
I didn't know you were this
dumb!
You did!
You did!
No way!
How do you do. My friend, could
you tell me
where I could get...
You couldn't...
Mister, ask at the drugstore,
they might have it.
Mrs. Parker, you should be
confined to bed.
Yes!
Mrs. Parker! Don't forget it,
10 drops before you shoot.
Before it, not after!
- Yes.
- No, did you get it?
Screw off...
Did you say something?
So you don't have anything to
tell me?
A real man always has something
to say,
is he's a real man, of course.
Mr. King, your steak.
Sir, it was my steak.
That's right, it was yours.
Harry, put $10 on my account.
Looks like the entire 30.
Fly!
Your health!
Shall we relax?
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
I didn't invite you.
Hi there.
That's friends, Peppy!
Careful there.
Sorry.
Harry, put $4 on his account!
$4!
Fly!
- Billy, I'm standing here.
- You'll lie down now.
Harry, I owe you $11!
Rowdy-dowdy... $12!
Excuse me, for Gods sake.
I'd like to have a drink with
you.
- I'd like a drink.
- I'm busy.
You refused. Too bad.
Fly!
It's serious, Billy, it's 80.
- Yesterday it cost 50.
- What about an inflation?
Gentlemen, I pass.
Hello!
Hi!
I'd like a drink.
- Harry, what's my count?
- 180, Billy!
Let's make it even. Fly away.
- A beauty.
- Sorry.
1, 2, 3...
4...
5, 6.
OK, guys, that's enough!
Time to clean up a bit.
You heard it, man.
The end!
The time has come,
And here we are!
Here we are, your babies!
That's it, enough scratching
your heads,
Enough sucking on bottles,
You'd better clap your hands!
A soldier is loved for his
dough,
An officer is loved for his
uniform,
But I love the cowboy
Because he's the only one!
A cowboy,
the hero of the magic dreams,
You excite me, I admit it,
Cowboy, a couple of tender words
You find for me and I'll go with
you.
Your steak, sir.
In the rattle of the day,
In the quiet of the night
I'll hear the words of love.
It's cold.
You only say it,
And I shall hear it.
Sir, it was my steak.
'Scuse me.
Where?
Sir...
- Harry, I owe you $100.
- Sorry, no credit.
I could lend it, if you don't
mind.
Please.
Your steak, sir.
Sorry.
An actor is loved for his art,
A player is loved for his music,
But why I love the cowboy,
I'll tell only to him!
I like you, man.
- Billy.
- Johnny.
Cowboy, you're a swell guy,
You've been exciting me for
years,
Cowboy, you're brave but the
problem is,
You can't put 2 words together.
Just for me, find them and put
them together,
I'll always hear you,
Just say it,
Say it, I'll hear you,
Tell me, I'll hear you,
I'll hear you.
Raise your leg higher, it'll be
a success,
The legs should be clearly seen,
If a cowboy orders it, who's
gonna refuse?
Guys, we are your babes!
A sailor is loved for his
courage, a captain for his wine,
But why do I love my cowboy?
'Cause he has everything...
'Cause he has everything...
'Cause he has everything...
'Cause he has everything there.
I love her.
Friend, this is hopeless.
Ms. Little's heart is
impregnable like Ft. Knox.
Ft. Knox is the national
treasury.
You'd better have a drink.
A drink of water if I could.
Water...
- Water.
- C'mere, my pin.
Never drink this piss.
If you're used to it, your life
won't be worth a brass fart.
We're relaxing, Johnny.
But a soul wants something
grander.
Billy!
Something light and huge.
What did you say?
Light and huge?
That's why I'm here.
D'you have a white bed-sheet?
No, you missed my point.
Sorry.
Who has a white sheet?
Billy, I think your friend here
tries to offend us.
Gentlemen...
I have a white sheet.
I even have 2 white sheets.
And both of them are yours.
I think Ft. Knox throws a white
sheet.
Over there, in the coach,
there's my equipment.
If it's not too hard for you,
could you do me a favor and
just send someone to...
Are you deaf? On the double!
Thank you.
Please take your seats.
Billy, I think 2 offences a day
are too much.
It's not just this thing was
hung on the wall,
we're made to look at it!
Gentlemen, could you really
think...
Mr. First, I'm at your service.
Just a sec.
Here you are.
I could never hurt your
feelings.
Careful with this.
I'd like to suggest a different
spectacle.
Go on, man!
I'm on my saddle already.
How could I kill the light?
Godspeed!
Attention!
You're witnessing the arrival of
the train...
Looks like it won't stop at this
station.
...to the St. Lazar Station in
Paris.
Enough shooting! What are you
doing?
Where are you running? My
friends, it's not scary.
It's not scary at all, Diana,
not in the least.
There has never been anything
scary for me in the world.
But you succeeded in it.
I won't grudge you my only eye
to have that feeling again.
Thank you.
Mr. First, your invention is a
miracle.
Guys made a sieve out of my
walls,
so the repairs could cost $100.
The cinema isn't my invention, I
just serve it.
May I drop dead if that thing
doesn't clear the head better
than whiskey.
Gentlemen,
could anyone reproach me for
not paying for my whiskey?
- No one could.
- Pay then.
Mr. First, I'm yours!
- Here, Harry.
- Thank you...
...for trusting me. Thank you
again. To continue.
Maestro, something easy.
The screen should be replaced
though.
- Ms. Diana!
- Already.
Gentlemen, have I missed the
train?
- Look.
- Stepped on it!
Have you seen him twisting his
hose?
Johnny is a swell guy!
I think, gentlemen, it was a...
Comedy.
I'm sure, you realize, that
rapture
is the best when it's converted
into gold.
I think 30% would be fine, huh?
I realize, this figure is an
offence for a man of business.
What would you say about 40%?
OK, 50.
- This is a robbery!
- I don't need anything.
When I see a man who doesn't
need anything,
I realize he'll take all of it!
I misjudged you, you're a hard
nut to crack.
What would be your conditions?
Sir, turn around.
Have a look around.
Around, sir.
You'll see the world
that is imperfect.
The country lost.
Blood, sin and avarice
set us apart.
We've been driven to the edge,
with only the abyss and eternal
dark beyond it.
But there is a way out.
Yes, I saw it.
That unforgettable night when
I found myself at the Boulevard des
Capucines in the Lumiere theater.
The cinematograph!
That's the Messiah that could
change everything.
It will make us purer and
better.
For that...
I can sacrifice everything.
Even my own life.
So you'll excuse me but any
mention of the money seems
sacrilegious to me.
The only thing I could allow is
selling admission tickets for
the lowest possible price,
in order to guarantee the supply
of new pictures.
I'm getting older.
To misjudge one man twice.
It had never happened before.
Make a decision! You have the
future of the cinema in your
hands.
OK, Mr. First, we're agreed.
You can roll your films. I won't
charge you.
Thank you, Mr. McCue.
You're a generous person.
Raise your legs higher, and
it'll be a success,
Only the legs should be seen,
If the cowboy orders it, who
could refuse him?
Billy, I've arranged everything!
A sailor is loved for his
courage, a captain for his wine,
But why I love my cowboy?
'Cause he has everything,
'Cause he has everything,
'Cause he has everything there.
Yes, I'm on time.
The water's disappeared. Where's
the water?
I'll give it to you. Let me go.
>From now on and forever,
Right now, in any weather,
Right here, and everywhere,
We'll live in a different way!
With no anger or sadness,
For the good of the earth,
We've long dreamt about it,
But could never do it.
Cinema, cinema, cinema,
We're crazy about you!
Yes, I see you're glad,
But afraid to be disappointed,
'Cause you've been duped many
times before.
You don't need dreamers,
Yes, sure, of course,
But I'm not a dreamer,
And I know how...
>From now on and forever,
Right now, in any weather,
Right here, and everywhere,
We'll liver in a different way!
With no anger or sadness,
For the good of the earth,
We've long dreamt about it,
But could never do it.
With no anger or sadness,
For the good of the earth,
We've long dreamt about it,
But could never do it!
Cinema, cinema, cinema,
We're crazy about you!
One more time!
Good morning!
It's good for some, and it's the
last for others, sir.
I'd like to order something from
you
that looks like a big box.
It's called a coffin.
I'd rather call it a cradle for
new life.
Are you a philosopher? What was
your school?
Harvard? Some Washington courses?
What an I saying? Where do they
train philosophers nowadays?
Have you graduated?
Alas, a naive youth came here
with his grand ideas.
To transform the world, to save
the country.
Where are his ideas now?
Let's get back to business,
though. Do you know the size?
Yes, sure.
I'd like you to make
a small window in the center.
It could be fun to look up from
the netherworld.
And the door on the other side,
to enter and exit at will.
It's my first time, when a corpse
is prepared to this active
afterlife.
- Here's the size.
- Where should I deliver?
Harry's Saloon.
The deposit.
I won't hurry you up.
I'm interested in the quality.
Hello, baby!
- Oh how cute we are!
- I like him too.
- Piss off, holy father!
- You'll regret it, daughter.
- Good morning, minister.
- Good morning, my son.
I'm sorry, I thought Ms.
Little lives here.
'Scuse me, Mr. First, I didn't
think it might be you.
Could this charming girl have...
...have any enemies?
I wish they were!
They're a god-damned admirers!
Come in, Mr. First.
If you only knew how hard it is
to remain a decent girl.
Especially if the girl...
is beautiful as you are.
Flowers? For me?
God damn it all!
Ms. Diana, what's wrong?
Oh Johnny, you're the first man
in my life
who ever brought me flowers.
Now my heart is forever yours.
The end. Farewell, my love.
The destiny separates us,
but you'll live forever in my
heart.
God damn it!
Some people have all the luck!
They fall in love.
They go to theaters.
- To lie...
- Don't, Billy.
To libraries.
And how they behave: excuse me,
please...
What about you, Hugh?
Have you ever said please in your
life?
Oh would you shut up for
Chrissakes? I'm sick as it is.
That gentleman would say,
"Hugh, shut up, please".
Gentlemen!
It's not a secret for anyone
that all of you declared your
love to me one time or another.
I don't mention words you used.
But could any one of you,
just once,
drop on your knees in front of
me?
You're right, baby.
Personally, I could
only manage
to slap your bottom.
What could be said here...
We're all shit and we swim in
shit.
It seems to me, Billy King, that
you're trying to offend me.
Tale my Colt, Martin, and
shoot me if I'm wrong.
I just think that "shit" is the
wrong word
to be used in a decent company,
and...
I second that.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Please.
Harry, what's wrong with you?
Farewell, my love...
The fate separates us...
But you'll live forever in my
heart... I can't...
That's art for you! This is
something to live for.
Such things make you want to
accomplish a lot.
I can't understand what's wrong
with me,
Everything's like a dream and a
reality,
And my heart beats in a new way,
Like I live afresh.
A magic ray
In the pitch darkness,
Thank you, oh thank you.
You're like a key
To my prison.
Thank you, oh thank you.
My pure ray, you illuminate my
way,
You're not hot, but I'm ablaze,
You light up the dark, and thank
you for that,
Oh thank you!
Mr. First, here's your ordered
item.
- The size is yours.
- I'm much obliged.
Have a nice day.
Mr. Danly, we haven't seen you
for ages.
You sure have had a lot of
changes. How interesting!
- Later.
- Should we deal a hand?
- I'd like to talk to you.
- I don't have time.
Harry, I'm dying of thirst.
I haven't seen you for ages,
Danly. Please.
What is it?
Water.
What?
You said you were dying of thirst
and I gave you water.
You stinking skunk!
I've spent the whole month at my
rancho
without a drop of whiskey,
and you give me water.
You cheap bastard. You coyote and
the coyote's son!
And you...
Danly, did you ask me for water
or...
Whiskey, god damn it!
Have I ever asked you anything
different?
Come on, Danly!
Gentlemen, my horse was the first
in line in the morning.
I was next to Billy.
Bollocks, Hubert, I was next to
Billy.
Martin was next to me, and we
haven't seen you here at all.
Gentlemen, queue up for the
admittance.
Please.
I need it badly!
Easy now!
Upon my honor, I'm broke.
I cry twice a day.
The first time, at night when I
watch the film,
then in the morning when I count
the losses.
- Mister, where should I put it?
- As usual.
- Hi there, Danly.
- What have you brought?
Could I have a free ticket,
mister?
You see, Danly, the dollar is
devalued.
Harry, have it really come to the
fact
that the lads drink this cow
slop?
Mr. Parker, please.
My Peggy says, if I come home
no black eyes, it means
I was with the girls,
and not in the saloon. She
doesn't give me money.
- No.
- Mr. Bobby, one last time.
Mr. Thompson, I've been letting
you in free for 2 weeks.
Clear the path.
OK then. Then I'll shoot you.
Shoot, but I'll be replaced by
someone else.
How do you do.
Sorry for bothering you,
gentlemen, but let me through.
Please, be so kind.
The third shot!
Mr. Johnson, don't be late.
Here, stick it, the bloodsucker.
Please, sir.
Your habit of entering after
the 3rd shot is irritating.
Martin...
Give me a black eye, if you
could.
Please, I really need it.
This is for my old woman.
You must be crazy. Thompson,
how could I hit a man? Who do you
think I am?
But I love my cowboy,
because he has...
Because I have...
I have everything!
So screw your cinematography!
They drink milk.
I'll have some rest.
Wait!
We used to dance for temptation,
And raised our legs without
shame,
Now we dance a lot more modestly,
And we are moved by beauty.
A magic ray
In the pitch darkness,
Thank you, oh thank you.
You're like a key
To my prison,
Thank you, oh thank you.
My pure light, you illuminate my
way,
You're not hot, but I'm all
aflame,
You light up my darkness, and
thank you for that,
Oh thank you.
What a beautiful hand.
It looks like it was created to
turn the projector's handle.
Your cinematograph is the whole
world.
You've opened a wonderful magic
window for me...
Which I will close.
Father, the cinema is
the cure for the sick.
And the opium for the people.
Please stop it.
That's why I...
Love my cowboy...
Did you say anything?
Does it mean you have nothing to
say?
A real man always have something
to say.
If he is a real man.
- Your steak, Mr. King.
- Thank you, sir.
Where is it? Here it is!
Here it is! Your steak, Mr. King!
- Harry!
- Yes, Billy?
Well I...
Thanks for your reminding me,
sir, that it was my steak.
- Did you want to say something?
- I wanted to say...
Harry, that it's time to serve
forks for dinner.
A gentleman shouldn't eat with a
knife only.
I'm sorry, sir, but I should
remind you that you're in a place
where films are shown.
We don't allow drinking liquor
here,
and carry it with you.
Go to hell with your film!
This shitty cinema of yours has
turned us into cowardly mules.
Did I hear you correctly? You
said "shitty cinema"?
Yes, shitty cinema and cowardly
mules.
I can forgive you mules, but only
them.
Could you be so kind as to do me
a favor?
At last!
Not here.
I wouldn't like to desecrate
this place.
He didn't like cinema.
I'm poisoned by the cinema.
The films substituted everything
for me.
I feel they're more valuable
than money to me.
Please advise me, father. I'm
torn in two.
My son, listen to the voice of
your heart.
For Lord speaks to you through
it.
My father,
I'll be broke then.
My son.
Listen top your reason, for Lord
gave it to you,
so that you could listen to it.
Should I get rid of First?
What about the cinema?
Won't I see it again?
Do you really think that Lord
could
tolerate your indecision
for your meager $10?
Here's a good fiance for you.
- But he's old.
- You're not going to boil him.
Johnny, I want us to have a
baby.
Today, right now.
Now? It's impossible, my dear.
There's time
for everything. We should
get married first.
You deceive me. Don't you want
to have a baby?
People kiss in your films, and
the next minute they have a
baby.
We've surely kissed a lot.
Diana, how should I put it?
It's called editing.
First, people kiss.
Then some time passes, a month
or a year.
Then they get married. Some more
time passes,
and they have a baby.
In cinema all this is edited
out.
A kiss...
A marriage...
And a baby.
Johnny, I want it like in the
cinema.
Please edit it.
- Diana...
- Johnny...
The Comanches!
That's him.
Where's Diana?
First! Comanches!
Stuffy! Take it!
Johnson, follow me. Harry, take
the machine-gun to the attic!
- Take Diana upstairs.
- I'm going with you.
You take care for the device!
Comanches are at the path of
war!
To work, gentlemen!
I'll die for First happily!
Peppy, we're going to see things
we'd better never see.
Let's get to work, gentlemen!
Farewell, love!
The destiny...
separates us.
Do it, Harry.
That damn woman! We're done with
now.
Hugh, how can you refer to a
lady like this?
I'm gonna slap her out.
My hand won't touch a woman.
Gentlemen, I pass!
I'm out of ammo!
- Me, too!
- Stuffy!
There's none... that's it!
I don't see a woman among you.
A pale-faced one.
With her hair like a morning
dawn.
- We didn't have a woman.
- Lies don't become a warrior.
I wish I could have a single
cartridge.
I wouldn't miss that painted ape.
I forgive the pale-faced one
his words.
He may have never heard of Sir
Charles Darwin and he
may not be aware that an ape
is our common ancestor.
Are you sitting in this booth?
Oh my chief, it is she!
I saw her the last moon.
If he lays a finger on her, I'll
tear his throat out.
I'll take part, too.
2 tickets to the afternoon
performance.
For me...
and for my squaw.
You killed First and now mock
us!
Woman, don't you dare touch my
husband!
I wish I knew what are they
dragging here.
Looks like a guillotine.
After Sir Charles Darwin
I can expect an electric chair
from them.
- You're alive!
- Johnny!
You have a motion sickness!
My darling, you're safe. I can't
believe my eyes!
Calm down, dear. The Indians
just invited me to visit.
They asked me to arrange a
seance for them.
Billy, set it up!
Please, come in.
No, I'd never sit
with Injuns.
Mr. Atwood, cinema doesn't have
borders
and races. Everyone's equal
facing the screen.
Johnny, you're a saint.
- No charge today.
- A saint!
Where are you going? Dad, what
about me?
You're too little.
Right, and I'm not little to go
the path of war.
- But when it comes to movies...
- Shame on you, White Feather.
You haven't celebrated your 16th
spring yet.
It's my seat.
It's my seat.
Go away.
Chief, take that jacket off, I
can't see anything.
If you jerk another time, I'll
shoot you.
Harry, you asked me for a piece
of advice.
Here it comes. Get rid of First
immediately.
Or he'll ruin you.
Get rid of him! Drive him away!
That's it! Stop!
Stop it.
What's wrong, Mr. McCue?
What do you want?
I won't allow it, you don't have
a right! Everyone watches it OK.
I suffer losses, and they don't
even let me watch it!
Wait, gentlemen.
Harry just wants to say that he
terminates Mr. First's lease of
the premises.
That's all there is to it.
Right, Harry?
Yes!
Gentlemen, calm down!
I'll try to negotiate it.
Harry,
a couple of words.
Billy, what could we talk about?
Go, Billy will explain.
Oh my pale-faced brother,
tell me, is the cinema going
to turn to the life of
Comanches?
I have a smashing plot idea.
Yes, it's quite smashing.
Gentlemen, you have a problem
with your sense of humor.
It was a joke!
Mr. First, continue, I pray.
I saw it,
and my mind was clouded.
Not in the dead of night, not
over blind walls and fences,
but on a white sheet...
A daughter of man
gave a man her...
kiss!
The creatures of debauch and
sin,
that's your cinema!
That's why I say unto you: if
you cherish your home...
Go,
and drive away
that God-awful Mr. First.
Hurry, women!
That's him!
I think it's worse than a
Comanche attack.
He looks like needing help.
We want movies!
A woman is a movie-goer too!
I think, Peppy, that if a woman
asks for something, she should
be granted this by all means, or
she'll take it herself.
Billy, set it up!
We want a film!
I'll kill him!
The art...
cannot be destroyed!
Set it up!
For a couple of words.
I'm fine as it is.
You don't want to sit through it
under the counter.
- There'll be no film.
- There will be, Harry.
The art doesn't burn!
- Right?
- Right!
Is it true?
You know, I'm so glad!
I'm just happy. You know how I
love cinema.
I do! Let's go!
Let's talk about your love of
it.
I hope, you'll remember this
conversation.
Let go of me, it hurts!
Don't get underfoot.
Oh it's perfectly fine.
Father, stop it.
We didn't come here for this.
Don't do it.
Don't!
- Hi, Chico!
- Good morning, sir!
Good morning, Mr. First!
Good morning, Billy! Is
everything right?
If I undertake something, I do
it.
- Everything's right.
- Mr. First.
- Good morning.
- Greetings.
Do you recognize me?
Sure! You're the undertaker.
- An ex-philosopher.
- It's in the past now.
Good morning, Ms. Diana!
Time to wake up.
Good morning, Conchita.
Your sheet...
I mean, your screen...
has been stolen!
Santa Maria, a drop to your
feet. Perform a miracle!
You know, in our town there's no
more white sheets.
Santa Maria, you've always been
so kind.
No time for pray.
Well, I'm unemployed now,
because people don't want to
part with their lives.
So I had a marvelous idea once,
why don't we organize a printed
edition in our town?
It could be entitled, say,
"Cinema", and it would cover
only the cinematographic issues.
What's good there, and the main
point, what's bad.
I've watched almost all films,
I start to have some ideas.
They might be interesting for
other people, too.
What do you think of my idea?
I think that if a philosopher
could become an undertaker,
why doesn't an undertaker
become a critic?
Quick, Conchita.
My darling,
my love, hello.
Don't be cross with me. Forgive
me.
- Quick, Ms. Diana!
- Conchita, scissors.
Bear with it.
Put it here.
What if you won't be in time?
I should.
- I won't survive the shame.
- You won't do it!
Don't touch it.
A girl that couldn't save the
most valuable thing
she has for her husband to be,
deserves death.
Billy, I'm showing it for the
last time.
There's no more.
That's it.
No, not this. The death is
better!
The art, Concita, demands
sacrifices.
We've made a new screen.
Take your seats, gentlemen.
The slave to love!
Why did you seek me?
Harry McCue?
Jack!
What can you do for money?
For money, I can do everything.
Here's $1000.
The life of the man named First.
Begging your pardon, miss.
Sir, some old woman is asking
for you.
- For me?
- Yes, you. She's afraid...
...to cross the street, and says
only you could help her.
My love,
I'll be back.
Billy...
Set it up!
Where's your granny?
Here you are.
Good evening.
Allow me to offer you help,
miss.
So our paths have crossed, sir.
To tell you the truth, I don't
enjoy it much.
Yes, I recognized you, "granny".
I offered you a place in
history.
You should visit our seances by
all means.
I invite you to the cinema.
I'm here!
You could cross the street in
some other place, granny.
Johnny!
Bear with it, my friend.
My love...
Don't die!
Don't die...
Jesus, I wish I could start
living anew...
How could I save you?
Only a miracle could save him
now.
No!
You road...
is long.
Wait, father.
Johnny...
Tell us your last...
No!
I swear...
we'll fulfil it.
We swear!
Billy...
Set it up!
A genius!
Could I go with you anyway?
Don't worry, my friend, nothing
bad will happen to me.
I hope he doesn't leave for
long.
I can't picture a day without
cinema.
Mr. First leaves for 3 days only
to get wedding presents.
- When do they have the wedding?
- On Sunday.
Is it true that the priest
refused to marry them?
It is. Yet Billy persuaded him.
I can imagine how he did that.
Cinema, cinema, cinema,
We're crazy about you.
Get lost!
Cinema... cinema...
We're crazy about you.
Whom do you see off?
Oh, he was a great man!
Why was he great?
He was the first to introduce
the cinema to us.
In this case, I'll be the next
one. My name's Second.
Are you the owner of this
saloon?
- I am.
- I have a business proposal.
He unscrews his head.
The cranium must crackle now.
What a big,
fat and delicious hand!
Now, the finger.
Andy, you forgot the second
ear. Well, excellent.
Guys, this is the real life.
Now, the leg...
How could you watch that junk?
That's awful shit, Mr. First.
I wish you knew how I miss your
films!
They could've made me human.
But the truth is bitter, in this
country
only the money could make a
gentleman human,
and Mr. Second's films bring me
money.
Mr. McCue, I've always suspected
that a businessman would kill a
movie-goer in you. But you...
Billy, how could you like it?
I watched it from the corner of
one eye.
Guys, enough sniveling!
You'll have the sequel!
Where's my steak?
Let me through, I have an urgent
business.
Are you all right, Mr. First?
- Where's Diana?
- Upstairs, with the priest.
Mr. First, my life is in your
hands.
But before you pull the trigger,
you should know, you'll never
find a man more faithful to you.
>From Mexico to Canada. I knew a
lot of happiness,
love of women and power of
money,
but all this is dust compared to
this.
I'll dedicate my whole life to
this God,
if you would leave it to me, of
course.
Say no more!
>From now on, my Colt and my
fists are at your service.
But before we set out from
here...
I should take revenge on Mr.
Second.
He desecrated the name of the
cinema.
He sows the seeds of hatred in
the audience's souls.
- He should die.
- Don't do it, Jack.
To each his own. The future will
judge us.
Let's move on, our audience's
waiting!
Oil both of your Colts real
good,
Oil your Winchester rifle, too,
And move on, because
You just had a fancy to move.
Let's go, that's all right,
Riding or walking.
I swear by the name of the
bloodthirsty coyote,
We'll reach some destination!
What will be, will be,
Whatever might happen,
What will be, will be,
And that's what there is.

Projectionist, roll it,

Add your bit of light
To the severe days of souls.
