I'm sorry if I scared.

That's life. What's your name?
My name is Jordan.
Well.
What happened to us?
Hello!
Anybody here?
Where are you going? Well ...
I came here somewhere ...
There must be a way to exit.
These walls are
solids, everywhere.
I found an opening.
A and a check.
I trust him ...
Grant?
Grant?
There ...
Do not go there ... If he
is the one who did this?
Grant?

Grant?
Grant?
Easy, easy! I am.
Jordan.
Jordan?
You think I did that?
You think I brought you here?
I do not know.
I know I have no reason to
trust me ...
But that's exactly what you
ask at this time.
Because I do not know what the hell
is going on here!
There ... What?
Take it!
Take it!
Let me go, bitch!
-- Calm down! Calm down!

Grant!

When a way to give you
'll calm down.
And you will not move as well?
We all calm.
And we'll focus.
-- You think you can do this?
-- Let me go.
Well.
Listen to me ...
Someone brought us here.
I do not know why.
I'm just scared and
confused as you all.
But turning us against each other
us arguing among ourselves, attacking us ...
That will not solve anything.
Agree?
Is there anyone else here.
I do not think it hurt.
Alex!
My name is Alex.
Who're you?
How did I get here?
Where are we?
Good question.
You broke his nose.
What happened?
I woke up and fucking
I crawled into a van.
I hit a few times
I managed to jump ...
-- You saw who did it?
-- How ...
It was in the middle of the night!
What else îţi May, remember?
Something about
can we say?
Before you break my nose
I began to talk about
secret wishes and dreams.
You need to get out of here.
Let spreads and TIME.
Let's go on the wall next ...
Search for any opening
we could get here.
Who has made you chief?
It's just a suggestion.
Can you do what you want.
DAY 1, 5:00 the subjects are
<i> and suspicious, confused ...</ i>
<i> am confident. </ i>
<i> DAY 2 </ i>
Get us out of here!
These bricks--and here for some time.
We try to exit im here.
They are set in stone.
Watch What's this?
There's a clock.
I think here we

Open the door!
Open the fucking door!
Motherfucker ...
Jesus ...
I think here we got there.
Not exactly what I expected.
n <i> That makes no sense. </ i>
Water.
Wonderful! Is this bastard
water left us crazy.
There are approximately 750
liters here.
Enough <i>
about two months. </ i>
Guys ...
It's damn private.
Hello!
Get me out of here!
Hello! Hey!
You heard me, asshole?
Get me out of here! Did you hear?
We will kill you.
That's why we're here.
No, we'll be fine.
Let us down here
to die.
No.
Because we are searching for friends
family, someone in this moment ...
He knows that I have gone
and we are looking for.
Right? That's bullshit
and know it well.
No one will find.
We are on your own!
You know where to it.
Always have obtained the
you wanted? We are in hell.
Watch out! Why not come here
Below, you bastard?
Did you hear?
Did you hear?
You're a dead man!
Excellent.
There are over 9 feet
cable here.
No! No! Go to hell!
You do not know how long we stay here.
I'll stay here.
Let's drink to hydrate while
what you expect to come here
and to do what they want with us?
Damn!
You want to switches to your Facebook
comporţi like an idiot?
-- We need to drink that water.
-- Seriously, old man?
Drink this. Stops you!
None of us has
wanted to be here.
But we need this water
until we find a way to exit here.
Please.
It has left us both
much water?
DAY 3
Are you okay?
Yes.
I'm fine.
What are you doing?
Well ...
I searched everywhere
in this place.
If there is an exit here e.
Someone put this wall
here for a reason.
I think that's the exit?
I do not know.
But I'm sure I'll find out.
Without a negative, how can
hole wall to preserve that?
Have you ever
a house of cards? Yes.
What happens when
it falls down a book?
The house is and you collapse. Yes.
This brick wall has
same principle.
If you can take one of the bricks,
those around them easier to remove.
Now it seems impossible, but ...
I was 20 years manufacturer.
Give me a little time and
to tear down this wall.
Everything seems impossible.
It's not impossible, but it will
take some time.
You should put them
a question ...
You must ...
There must be a reason.
What does he want from us?
I'm just an accountant, for
God's name.
You're married?
Divorced. Grant?
There ... Widowed.
Leave me guess ... none
of you ... he has family?
No. And very few
friends, and to them?
How do you know that?
Replace and others bet
two have the same story?
Luke.
Luke.
Doors resin, resin door.
I want to ask you some
questions.
Do not tell you anything, you idiot.
We just try to us
figure out why ...
Why chose us.
There must be a reason.
There is no reason.
Who did this one do
entertainment, and the So ...
That bastard took me
Tic--tac's.
We can sit here and discuss the reasons,
while he is up there
wondering what to do
with his new toys.
-- Do not listen. I just ...
-- Do not give a shit, right?
It was really
helpful.
There is a pattern. Just
Understanding what it is
What <i> pattern </ i>
I do not know ... Things
we share.
You live alone? Yes.
Tell me about your life.
What do you know? I do not know. Everything.
Daily habits.
Place of work, family dwells
nearby? Friend? Anything.
He said that there can help me.
I tried to go once, but
things just got worse.
"Victim?"
He likes to hurt me.
I think I want to die.
I tried once.
"Chameleon"
I could not do it.
"Revenge or self--defense?"
In the beginning ...
I thought he brought me here.
"Dancers accused of murder
the brutal boyfriend. "
But that's impossible, because ...
He's dead.
I think they know what is the pattern.
I was convicted
that I killed my wife.
Kim had cancer and i. ..
It got to a point where I
asked for help. And I helped her.
I spent two years in prison.
I lost everything. House, business,
My two daughters.
I have never understood.
Perhaps that is why we chose.
You and you are responsible Grant
someone's death.
It remains only a single
question for you, Luke.
You who have killed?
I was my fault.
I never wanted to hurt
anyone.
I just ...
I needed money. "Suspected
killing seller "
I do not know why he dropped.
Should be easy.
And besides ...
"Wanted" which I did
I had to do.
It gave me no choice.
The so that you killed her.
She pulled the gun from
behind the counter.
He wanted to hurt me.
We pedepsiţi?
We are here because
I killed someone?
Please wait ...
I do not ...
I have not killed anyone.
I've done nothing wrong.
I'm not like you.
-- I am not a criminal.
-- Was self--defense. Idiot!
It was a mistake!
I made a mistake!
I would not be here.
You made a mistake!
"Lonely"
I do not have them!
Fear of confrontation?
Please let me out!
"Self--mastery of the subject"
Do what you want with them, I do not care!
Let me go!
Calm down! Give me!
It's a mistake.
<i> not supposed to be here. </ i>
I am innocent.
DAY 4
It is a scalpel.
What is that?
What does it say?
Jordan?
The human body can not survive
more than 30 days without food.
Do not understand. What does that do?
I do not know.
Minds.
-- No, I do not know.
-- Stop playing with us.
What the fuck you know? You said that
we're in this together.
This blade is ...
specifically created to cut
skin and muscles.
It's a knife for human flesh.
"Unbelievable"
"Imagine your"
He really wants to do that.
Why would it?
-- Why would anyone want that?
-- Because it ţicnit.
Well, this will never happen.
Why not get me to and I keep it?
The so eviţi to cut you one.
You know something?
I was nice to you until
now, son. But enough.
If you push me, you
I hit, you get it?
Tăceţi, listen!
What is this?
What's this?
Music! Is anyone there?
-- What? There was something wrong?
-- No, I heard something.
And quiet you up, baby. It's just
music. There's nobody here.
It's okay.

-- Well, now, and I've heard.
We are here! Hello?

You need to get out of here.
There are people down there.
You must help them.
Help! Please! You hear!

It's a signal.
Bring help!
Bring help!

There are three stages ...
Right now, our body squeeze
calories from last meal.
And decreases body fat is
consumed by the system.
Blood pressure drops.
Just and body temperature.
The second stage can take

You will feel muscle pain.
Sensitivity to noise, pain

Depression and hysteria.
Proteins are neesenţiale

The goal is only
To stay alive.

The whole system begins to fall.
Metabolism decreases

A practical and just as your body
would eat himself.
Does it hurt?
Yes.
Helen Henry, examiner
Medico--legal, what have we here?

Severe hypothermia.
It seems that's here for weeks.
