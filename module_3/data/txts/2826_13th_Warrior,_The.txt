<i>I met a beautiful woman...</i>

<i>complained to the Caliph...</i>
<i>who made me the ambassador</i>
<i>to the land of the</i> Tossuk Vlad--

<i>far to the north.</i>
<i>I was banished</i>
<i>from my home...</i>
<i>and from all</i>

<i>So, I journeyed by camelback many months</i>
<i>into the lands of barbarian peoples</i>--
<i>accompanied by Melchisidek,</i>
<i>an old friend of my father</i>--
<i>through the lands of the Ogus,</i>
<i>the Khazars and the Bulgars,</i>

I am Son to Hygiliak,

We all know
your worthy lord.
We come on an errand
to serve him.
My Lord Hrothgar will want
to welcome you himself.
<i>No wall, no moat,</i>
<i>not even a presentable fence.</i>
You couldn't keep a cow
out of this place.
<i>[ Man ] Women and children.</i>
Barely a man

<i>My lord, this is Buliwyf,son of</i>
<i>Hygiliak, come from across the sea.</i>
<i>I know the man.</i>
<i>I sent for him.</i>
<i>Knew him as a boy,</i>
<i>knew his father,</i>

<i>Grown to a fine,</i>
<i>fine man.</i>

he might be mad.
Be in the mist.
<i>[ Chuckling ]</i>
<i>Has anyone seen one ?</i>
- Has anyone seen one
in a hundred years ?
- Hyah !
They say they used to be
all over this countryside...
and worse further north.
People say many things.
Whatever they are,
unless we can track them,
we need a proper fence
and some sort of moat--
<i>[ Man ] We could fashion a gate</i>
<i>from a wagon.</i>
I don't want to build a fence.
I'm not a farmer.

[ Whining ]

<i>No horse tracks.</i>
- <i>They were afoot.</i>

They have been...
gnawed upon.
It is said
they eat the dead.
Wh-What kind of a man...
could do that ?
It was not man.
- It's the Wendol.
- Shh !
They are here.
[ Spits ]
What is it ?
- The mother of the Wendol.
- [ Shouts ]
<i>[ Horse Whinnies ]</i>
- The trail ?
- Dies in the rocks, two miles up.
So they are clever.
And cautious.
<i>And there's more.</i>
To the right.
The ridge near the watchtower.
<i>And to the south.</i>
The edge of the trees
near the first ridgeline.
Something drove them out.
Put your hand down,
little brother.
<i>I believe they watch us.</i>
<i>Even now.</i>
If we chase ?
- They melt.
- Will they come to us ?
The farmers say
they come with the mist.
So, if there's a fog,
they will come.
We are hunted now
in our own land.
<i>It wasn't always such.</i>

What of the settlements
to the north and upcountry ?
<i>Estwyck was burned.</i>
- Two years.
- Two years... ago.
<i>And the others,</i>
<i>we had no word.</i>
Not for some months.
<i>At night,</i>
<i>with the drink upon them</i>--
You do not drink tonight ?
No, we don't drink tonight.
But let the dawn come,
and they see the bodies.
This gentleman has the look of a great
warrior. No doubt he's very brave.
But to face the Wen...
he'll need
some amazing luck.
Luck often enough
will save a man,
if his courage hold.
<i>That's as may be.</i>
- Who is that man ?
- King's son.
But wait for the Wendol
one night's time...
and then talk to us
of courage.
I thank the lord
for his advice,
though I don't recall
hearing any exploits of his...
apart from killing
his brothers.
<i>[ King ] You sit down</i>
<i>and be silent!</i>
These are guests
at what is still my table !
[ Guests Murmuring ]
There is a man
who was at Estwyck.
I saw the thing
that did this clear enough !
Teeth like a lion,
head like a bear,
claws that could tear
a plank to kindling.
<i>They come in the night,</i>
<i>in the mist.</i>
Always in the darkest, like they
could see in the black.
Did they go on two legs
or four ?
It seems they did both, like a thing
that was both man and bear.
<i>Though, myself,</i>
<i>I cannot tell.</i>
I saw the glowworm, though.
Saw it clear.
We all did on the last night.
<i>Saw it come down out of the hills,</i>
<i>through the mist.</i>
<i>Slithering this way and that.</i>
<i>Long as a hundred ships.</i>
<i>Spitting</i> fir<i>e at us</i>
<i>as it came.</i>
My father's father
always warned of it.
Said it was a hate
from old times.
There will be fog.
- [ Whispering ]
- <i>Bring me my armour!</i>
I will stand
the watch with you.
My lord, the children
will need protection.
Should they pass us,
then you and yours must stop them.
<i>[ Men Shouting ]</i>
Luck in battle, boy.
<i>[ Door Closes ]</i>
<i>[ Ahmed ] How can you sleep</i>
<i>at a time like this ?</i>
The Old Father wound the skeane

Is there a choice ?
Come with me.
There is a woman who can help.
Bring the Arab.
<i>There's one down here</i>
<i>who was old...</i>
<i>when my grandmother</i>
<i>was a girl.</i>
She's quite mad.
The perfect advisor.
Oh, Weilew.
Oh.
[ Clicks Tongue ]
Shame, shame, shame.
It's a Queen Weilew fronts
me now, does she not ?
We seek your counsel,
Madam.
We or he ?
Step closer, Buliwyf.
<i>Closer.</i>
You know me ?
I have ears.
"Warrior," says the wind.
<i>''Chieftain, ''</i>
<i>says the rain.</i>
But why seek you me ?
Met you your match ?
Met you your match...
<i>with the eaters of the dead?</i>
We seek your wisdom.
Wars are won in the will.
Perhaps you've been fighting
in the wrong field.
<i>Have you a token ?</i>
<i>A thing.</i>
- A thing of them.
- Yes.
Ahh.
They show you the way
you will not see.
Slaughter them
till you rot.
<i>You'll accomplish nothing.</i>
Find the root.
-<i>Strike the will.</i>
- How ?
This is the mother
of the Wen.
She they revere.
She is the will.
Where do I seek her ?
She is the earth.
Seek her in the earth.
[ Clears Throat ]
<i>And Buliwyf,beware</i>
<i>the leader of their warriors.</i>
He wears
the horns of power.
He, too, you must kill.
Have we anything
resembling a plan ?
<i>Uh-huh. Ride till</i>
<i>we find them, kill them all.</i>
[ Panting ]
A child could
follow this.
They have no fear,
no fear of us at all.
[ Dog Barks ]
[ Barks ]
The dog
does not approve.
<i>Bear skulls.</i>
I don't think
they like company.
The claws.
The headdresses.
Bears.
They think they are bears.
They want us
to think they are bears.
Hey, how do you
hunt a bear ?
Chase it down with dogs.
What--
How do you hunt a bear
in winter ?
Go in his cave
with spears.
Where is a cave ?
It's in the earth.
<i>[ Horse And Rider Approaching ]</i>
The next glen,
many fires.
Is there a cave ?
<i>[ Rushing Water Sound ]</i>
But there's
no cave.
Yes, there is.
-<i>Straight into the rock face.</i>
- Can we get to it ?
If they don't
keep dogs, maybe.

[ Shouts ]
[ Arrow Whooshes ]
You'd have to
kiss me first, dearie.
Let's go.
[ Snoring ]
Oh, how deep in
the Earth are we ?
- Deep enough to fall out the bottom.
- Come on !
Look at your feet.
I was wrong.
These are not men.
<i>[ Rushing Water Sound ]</i>
<i>If we cut our way</i>
<i>through them,</i>
we will have
the other lot on us.
Down the wall,
<i>and we swim.</i>
I go.
[ Grunts ]
- Let's go, little brother.
- I do not enjoy heights.
[ Grunts ]
[ Grunts ]
Stay.

It is done ?
It is.
<i>[ Shouting ]</i>
A hard fight to get

<i>Hey, there's</i>
<i>a passage leading down.</i>
[ Groans ]
[ Groans ]
I've run about
as far as I care to.
[ Spits ]
Today was a good day.
A good day.
<i>[ Men Shouting, Distant ]</i>
Get along, lad.
Go.
Helfdane ?
We'll just keep
following this stream.
It has to come out
somewhere.
Stream disappears
under the rocks.
- Buliwyf!
- I'm all right.
We fight by twos.
Give the other pair a chance to rest.
<i>[ Rumbling ]</i>
Here they come.
Go on,
make it worse.
Now it's gonna rain.
[ Laughs ]
-<i>[ Men Laughing ]</i>
- It's gonna rain. It's gonna rain.
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait !
- Thunder.
- Waves make thunder.
- The thunder cliffs.
- Surf. Surf.
There's a surf
out there.
<i>Can we swim it ?</i>
<i>Do we drown trying ?</i>
Try it.
Breathe ! Breathe !
Deep breath !
Now, one, two, three !
The way we'll know is...
if they don't follow us,
it's too far to swim !
[ Laughs ]
[ All Gasping ]
<i>Not through the night.</i>
- <i>His fate is sealed.</i>
-<i>[ Ahmed ] You don't know that.</i>
The skeane is tied.
The weave
was settled long ago.
You're wearing that
long face for me ?
I cannot help it.
I have only
these hands.
I will die
a pauper.
You will be buried
as a king.
A man might
be thought wealthy...
<i>if someone</i>
<i>were to draw...</i>
<i>the story</i>
<i>of his deeds...</i>
that they may be remembered.
Such a man might be
thought wealthy indeed.
He's traveling
to the other side.
He grips his sword
as if afraid he will not wake.
<i>Think no more of these things.</i>
<i>You must rest now.</i>
- I'm not tired.
- <i>Rest.</i>
The Wendol want vengeance
for killing their mother.
<i>They will</i>
<i>come soon.</i>
Again ?
We killed the mother
but not the leader.
As long as he lives,
they will come back to fight us.
When ?
Tonight.
[ Sighs ]
The evening
lasts so long here.
<i>Not like home.</i>
I don't think tonight
there will be--
-<i>[ Horn Blowing ]</i>
- fog.
<i>[ Horn Blowing ]</i>
[ Grunting ]
[ Child Crying ]
<i>[ Rumbling ]</i>
" Kill the mother,"
she said.
" Kill their leader
and they will break."
We'll soon find out
if she was right.
At least we don't
have to worry about fire.
They're all terrified,
ready to break and run.
I wish we had
Buliwyf with us.
It's a small matter.
Here.
Prepare yourselves.
Merciful Father,
I have squandered my days
with plans of many things.
This was not among them.
But at this moment,
I beg only...
to live the next
few minutes well.
-<i>[ Babies Crying ]</i>
- When the time comes.
Don't let them
be taken.
For all we ought
to have thought...
and have not thought,
all we ought to have said...
and have not said,
all we ought to have done...
and have not done,
I pray Thee, God,
for forgiveness.

- and my brothers.
-<i>and my brothers.</i>
'Lo there do I see
the line of my people,
back to the beginning.
'Lo they do call to me.
They bid me
take my place among them.
In the halls of Valhalla,
where the brave...
may live...
forever.
Aah !

We shall make prayers
for your safe passage.
Prayers to who ?
<i>In your land one god is perhaps enough,</i>
<i>but we have need of many.</i>
I will pray to all of them for you.
Do not be offended.
I'll be in your debt.
Good-bye, Arab !
Good-bye, Northman.
<i>[ Ahmed Narrating ]</i>
