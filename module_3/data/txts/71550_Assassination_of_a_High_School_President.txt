Do you wanna know
the truth about high school?
You've got to break it down into its elements.
Unfortunately, at St. Donovan's,
the periodic table is more crooked
than a case of scoliosis.
But just give me the chance,
and I'll set it all straight.
Case in point...
Spanish homework.
"Dame un batido de esperma"...
does not mean,
"Take me to the airport."
It means,
"Give me a sperm milk shake."
And 22 kids gave that as an answer
in Spanish 3 last week.
I'm not sure
about the milk shake,
but somebody's sure
feeding us something sticky.
Every clique on campus
is copying the same damn homework...
burn-outs, pretty boys, drama dorks, jocks,
debaters, player haters,
you name it.
Oh, it's big, all right,
and I'm on it like pink rubber bands on
your little sister's braces.
The name's Bobby Funke.
I write for the paper.
Wait.
Wait a second. Who?
- Bob-Bobby Funke. I write for the paper.
- No, you don't.
I'm Tad Goltz, and I write for the paper.
You don't write for shit.
Wait. Aren't you the freshman they tied
to the snowman penis?
Sophomore.
Bobby, you can't expect us
to give you a story like this...
when's there's nothing written
and there's hardly proof.
Look, Clara, I'm the best writer you've got.
Tell me differently.
You've never finished an article.
Well, then do you wanna go
to homecoming with me?
No.
Clara Diaz, editor in chief
and one tough cookie.
All I wanted was a taste.
Friedrich Nietzsche said,
"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."
Bobby.
But 10 bucks says Nietzsche never got a swirly.
Can't talk right now,
Clara.
I feel really bad
about what happened.
I know you're going for that Northwestern
program, and I have an assignment for you.
Take you to homecoming?
Heard you were going with Tad.
- You know what Tad's short for, right?
- Theodore?
No. Vagina.
Look it up.
I want you to write a story
on the student body president.
- Really?
- Really.
Just get it on paper
this time, okay?
Okay.
Finally, my big break.
It was just
the story I needed...
to get into the Northwestern
summerjournalism program.
Instead of delivering papers
this summer,
I'd be well on my way
to writing for them.
Give me a piece
of loose-leaf.
Come on. Give me
a piece of loose-leaf.
Give me a pen.
What happened to the last pen I gave you?
Give me a pen, Funky.
Give me a pen.
Take it.
Everybody paid attention...
when Francesca Fachini
walked into a classroom.
She was a National Merit scholar,
the varsity soccer captain...
and the president's
girlfriend.
I'd interview her
for the story...
just as soon
as I grew some testicles.
- # Buenos días #
- Buenos días.
Senor Funky.

What?

I'm... fine. How are you?

Hmm?
The president was
a busy man, an important man,
and he was about to give me the story
of my high school career.
Would you please state your name,
year and social security number?
Paul Moore.
I'm a senior.
I'm not gonna
give you my soc.
Aren't you the freshman they tied
to the snowman penis?
Sophomore.
As president, how would you say
you're gonna handle...
the recent drop
in A.C.T. And S.A.T. Scores?
Well, what would you
have me do about it?
Seriously, you've
seen me on the boards.
I'll do whatever it takes
to get it done,
and that's
a Paul Moore promise...
to you, to St. Donovan's,
to Paul Moore.
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Mi amor.
Con regalo.
Mi Amor.

Buenos días,
Senor Funky.

After 30 minutes in the
shower, one thing was clear.
Paul was all length
and no depth.
He didn't give you
a whole lot.
How could he not give you a whole lot?
People love him.
He's like fucking J.F.K. He's smart.
He's charismatic. He's good-Iooking.
He's a tenacious athlete.
I'm sorry, Tad.
I didn't realize you felt that way about him.
It's sad.
Ongatumamwe with the rebound.
The man from Sudan.
Come on! Call that!
That's a time-out.
Friars.
Bring it in. Bring it in.
What's going on
out there, guys?
Huh? You guys look like a dump
that I took last Thanksgiving.
- What's the matter, Pauley?
- I don't know, Coach. I'm not feeling it.
You got to feel it, son. You got to feel the flow
and go. You understand?
Son, you feel, flow, go, hoop, win.
Pauley, ball game.
No one understands why you got the Moore
story instead of Tad Goltz.
I'm sure there's a lot
you don't understand, Tad.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I understand art when I see it.
Marlon Piazza,
Bobby Funke.
I write for the paper.
I'm doing a piece on Paul Moore.
- I was wondering...
- Piss off, dork.
Those gentle giants were the pillars...
of St. Donovan's student council.
Marlon Piazza, vice president
and Francesca's step-brother.
Matt Mullen, head hall monitor
and noted date rapist.
Marty Mullen, class secretary and
former child underwear model.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
You hear that pop?
- There was no pop.
- Can we give Mr. Moore some room, please?
- Watch out.
- You all right, Paul?
- Should we get him up?
- Let's get him up.
Come on, Paul.
Snap it up. Snap it up!
The basketball game
wasn't all we lost that night.
Like Nixon's men
at Watergate,
a thief crept in
and stole our innocence.
What kind of f'in' a-hole would do
something like this, Nancy?
- I don't know, sir. Should I call the police?
- No.
Bring me the list.
Whenever trouble
came to St. Donovan's,
the principal rounded up
the same ol' delinquents.
But that dark morning,
there was one new name on the list.
- Bobby Funky?
- Actually, it's pronounced "Funk."
Principal's office, now.
It feels nice in here.
My ass itches.
Who is this guy?
- What's his name?
- Bobby Funky.
- Franky?
- Funky.
- Looks like a little gentleman.
- He does? Look at him.
- Looks like a stockbroker.
- He's so little. Funky.
Don't look at me.
What happened
to your face, man?
Look at it.
It's like you have a culo on your face.
Got a culo.
Did you ever get
a man on your back?
Breathing hard?
Riding you
like a horse?
No?
I assume you all
know why you're here.
Let me guess.
You finally wanna start that boy band
you've been dreaming about.
Landis, do I come down to the strip club
where you work...
and knock the dick
out of your mouth?
Against the wall.
You're late.
Actually, um...
I'm not entirely certain
why I'm here, sir.
Really?
It's fascinating.
- This is why you're here. This.
- That's sick.
You've got a gum problem that's rapidly
turning into an attitude problem.
That's why you're here.
I don't like gum.
I don't like
your snooping around.
You are all filth.
Your parents have
obviously spoiled you...
or, in your case, possibly abused you
a little too much.
Now, one of you
little vermin...
broke into this office and
stole the S.A.T.'s last night.
Of this I am certain.
I beg you, I beseech you
do not come forward...
because I will have the pleasure
of tracking you down,
much the same way that I tracked down that
camel-humping ammunitions envoy...
two clicks
east of Tigris,
the birthplace
of civilization.
Mr. Cipriato.
- Do you know the arabic word "laa hriiq"?
- No.
It means,
"Don't shoot. Don't shoot."
You may wanna
remember that.
Dismissed.
Hey, Francesca.
Hey, Funky.
So, um, what are you doing
in the men's room?
Well, I thought
I might find a man in here.
Are you a man, Funky?
I'm just
screwing with you.
I just need your help.
With what?
Whoever stole the S.A.T.'s,
I need you to find them and get them back.
I aced that thing. I know it.
I was just in a zone.
- Do you know what "mastication" means?
- No.
Me neither,
but in that moment, I did.
It was perfect.
I need you
to find those tests.
Why me?
I don't know.
I've got a feeling about you, Funky.
This stuff's
right up your alley.
So do you have any idea of
who might have taken the S.A.T.'s?
We took the S.A.T.'s?
L... I didn't. I didn't.
- Did you take them?
- No, I didn't take them.
Everyone was
in their classrooms.
That's what all
the commotion was about.
Okay, where were you
last night?
That's where I was
last night.
# Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi,
yi, yi, yi, yi-yi #
# Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi,
yi, yi, yi, yi #
Hey, Funky.
Funky, want a gum ball?
It's good. It's soft. It's sweet.
I'm not falling for
the gum ball trick, Cipriato.
So you can put your ball bag
back in your pants.
What's it like sucking
on another man's fingers?
- What's it like stealing the S.A.T.'s?
- I asked you first.
# Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi,
yi, yi, yi, yi, yi #
Where were you that night?
- What do you care?
- I'm writing your biography.
Fine. Let me copy off you,
and I'll tell you.
Fine.
I was at the Park Arms
with my nana playing bingo.
I got 30 fucking geriatrics
that can back that up.
- I'm touched, Cipriato.
- Not a word, Funky.
After tailing Landis,
I discovered her secret life
outside of school.
She opened up...
once I promised to keep
her ice capades under wraps.
I don't know
who took them, Nancy Drew,
but I do know it happened
during the game.
I was out in the parking lot
last night,
and I saw some flashlights
bounce around in Kirkpatrick's office.
What were you doing
in the parking lot?
I was probably getting fingered
by Dutch Middleton.
Okay.
Thanks, Landis.
Long time no see, Rocky.
- Weekends and holidays, man.
- Thanks.
Did you do it?
- No. You?
- I wish.
Those tests are the tool
of the racist bourgeoises.
Get back to your cage, butt boy.
Last night? Nah, man.
I got picked up for possession.
Spent the night in holding.
It's creepy. You know.
It's fucked up. Ooh.
That's some alibi.
Fuck it. Fuck it. Hold this.
This is my jam, man. Ooh!
Gracias.
Ooh!
# I'm on the wire
# I'm on the wire #
None of these bad apples had stolen the tests.
Their alibis were like Dutch ovens...
gamey, but airtight.
Maybe I was looking
at it all wrong.
Maybe a good kid
was behind it.
What scares you, Funky?
You know what scares me?
Injustice.
You know why?
Because it's everywhere.
You think I don't see Cipriato behind me
jerking off right now?
He's a dead man. I'll deal with him.
But the thing about
fighting injustice...
is choosing
your battles wisely,
and my battle right now is to find out
where are my missing S.A.T.'s.
Now, I don't know your involvement
in all of this, Funky,
but I'm watching you.
I got both eyes open,
and they're on you.
- You read me?
- Yes. Yes.
You bleed, Funky.
We all bleed.
Thank you, sir.
Tad, am I gonna get my story
on the girls bowling team any time soon?
Get off
my fucking back, Clara.
- Nobody gives two shits about girls bowling.
- I give two shits, okay?
How many more shits do I need to get a story
from you, Tad? And Bobby?
- Yeah?
- Where's my story on Paul Moore?
Paul was a good kid.
Maybe his bum knee
wasn't so bad.
Maybe my puff piece was no pastry.
It's on its way.
So, um, how long, uh...
So how did Paul's knee
look that night?
Okay. Why?
Well, because, Nurse Platt,
Paul injured it.
That's why
they brought him here.
Oh.
I thought he had diarrhea,
but he was limping,
so I guess he did hurt
his little stem.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, um, were you...
here with him in the office the whole time?
- Yeah.
Well, except I got hungry,
and Paul said I should
get something to eat.
His treat.
So I went across the street
and got a gyro at that Greek place,
Little Spiro's.
Have you ever been there?
It's so good.
Do you mean to tell me
that Paul was alone in here?
I mean, so good.
How long did you leave Paul
on his own that night?
Um, hey, D.,
when I go get Greek food,
how long does it take me?
- About 20 minutes, a little more or less.
- Mm.
Hey, what's up, Franky?
Just get me the sandwich.
Yeah, I want a foot-long
spicy Italian sausage. That's right.
Yeah. I got one, and I want one.
Yeah, see,
that's a double entendre.
Yeah. That's right.
I coached English for two seasons.
I got to go.
I got to go.
Ay, yi, yi.
- So where were we?
- Um... Uh, Paul Moore's college prospects.
You know, grades have never been
Paul's strong suit.
But if he wants to go lvy,
he'll get in.
Believe me, that boy will do
whatever it takes to win.
That's P.M.W.
That is the Paul Moore Way.
P. Moore! P. Moore!
The coach gave me Paul's motive.
The nurse, opportunity.
My guts
said I had my guy,
but on my way home,
I realized I needed an inside source...
to back it all up.
I also needed to get my license.
Lately, me and the D.M.V.
Weren't seeing eye to eye.
When parking along a curb
on an uphill slope,
we turn our wheels
to the... Nope.
When there's a yellow light,
we approach the intersection at a nice...
Nope.
And when we come
to an object in the road like...
A dog, we...
Nope.
I was looking for a corroboration on my story.
Woodward and Bernstein
had their Deep Throat. I needed mine.
Fortunately, I knew just the girl.
She sounded
hesitant on the phone...
but told me
where I could find her.
Hey, Chrissy?
I'm a friend
of your brother Paul.
No. No, you're not.
How do you know?
Okay.
Well, um... Has Paul ever
taken you to one of his games before?
You're a high schooler
and you don't have a car?
Why don't you have a car?
That's irrelevant, Chrissy.
Nice sandwich.
I want a unicorn.
Um, neat.
You know, when I was your age,
I wanted a pet giraffe.
Giraffes suck.
Get me a unicorn, and I'll tell you
so many secrets about Paul.
Very secret secrets.
Here's the thing, Chrissy.
Unicorns don't actually exist.
Stuffed animal unicorn,
doofus.
Oh.
All right!
Chrissy Moore was one unicorn well spent.
After she filled in the blanks,
my story was
right there in front of me,
but I still had no solid proof.
Were my hunches enough
to write the article?
Fuck it.
Woodward and Bernstein.
Hey! I won't
tell you again, Ongatumamwe.
This is P. Moore shampoo.
I've got enough clout around here
to get your ass deported for less.
You, uh, fellas here
for the cockfight?
Yo. This story's gonna start,
like, a friggin' coup d'état in this bitch.
Thanks, man.
I like your dreads.
Funky. It was nice.
Listen. I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
This is crazy.
I didn't do anything.
Hey, I'm the president.
I'm the president.
I'm Paul Moore.
I'm Paul Moore. I didn't do any...
I didn't do anything.
It's all right.
I didn't do anything. Don't worry.
Open it up.
- I didn't do...
- Open it up.
I don't... I don't know where those...
Those aren't Paul Moore's.
I don't...
I don't...
I don't know
how those got...
Let's go.
Come on, Paul.
Don't fight it.
This is crazy.
I'm a... I'm a patsy.
I'm a patsy!
But in the end, Paul Moore kept his promise.
He did whatever it took to get the job done,
even the unthinkable.
P.M.W.,
the Paul Moore Way.
The name's Bobby Funke.
I write for the paper.
So I just want
everyone to know...
that I am submitting this article
to the Northwestern people...
with my highest
recommendation.
- Whoa!
- Funky!
I wanted to thank you
for finding the S.A.T.'s...
and for showing me
what a douche Paul really is.
See, the thing is, I seem to have lost
my date to homecoming,
and I wanted to know
if you'd go with me.
- You wanna go to homecoming with me?
- Well, not like, "Go, go."
- Not like for real.
- Yeah.
- Everyone has a date, except the mathletes...
- Right.
And then maybe that wrestler
with the jock itch on his face.
So, yeah.
The only person I can go with is you.
I still don't see...
why you wanna go with me.
Yeah, why not?
You're like the school's Wolf Blitzer now.
Well, Wolf Blitzer's
like a TV reporter.
I'm into
Woodward and Bernstein.
You already have a date?
What? No. I just...
Great. Then you can
pick me up at 8:00.
Oh, and no wrist corsages.
Get the kind with the pin.
I don't mind a little prick
every once in a while.
St. Donovan's, good morning.
This is your principal, Mr. Kirkpatrick.
As you know, uh, there's been a regime
change here at the school,
and your new president, Marlon "Piezza,"
is gonna say a few words.
- Piazza.
- What?
Marlon Piazza.
- What, is that Italian?
- Uh, I think so.
Marlon Piazza is gonna say
a few words to you, so stand by.
You're on the air.
No f'in around, huh?
Thank you, sir.
Fellow students,
this has been
a difficult time for all of us.
But do not lose faith
in this institution,
because from great tragedy
comes great triumph.
Let me be the first to say that the actions
of your next president...
It's open.
Hey, Marlon.
So is it true that she
got a perfect score on her S.A.T.'s?
Yeah. Her freshman year.
I'll let you play
with her tits for 20 bucks.
Hi, Funky.
You're good.
It's a nice place
you got here.
Have a good look
while you can.
I doubt you'd
be coming by again.
I guess that I should congratulate you
on your new presidency.
Isn't it funny how someone can be your
average cakewalk V.P. One day...
and then head
of the school the next?
Yeah. It's like how someone can be
the school joke one day...
and then go to homecoming
with the hottest girl at St. Donovan's the next.
She's, like,
your half sister, right?
Stepsister.
Hey, Funky.
Hey, Francesca.
Wow. You look...
awesome.
Thanks. You look
pretty good yourself.
I like your shoes.
Oh, she doesn't have
to go to the hospital again, does she?
Nyah.
Is your car out front?
Oh, well, it's such a nice night,
I thought that we could walk.

I didn't steal
those S.A.T.'s.
Then where were you

Who the hell do you think you are?
Inspector Gadget?
You really think I'd chance
everything for a test score?
I'd already
gotten into Cornell.
Then why did you take
the S.A.T.'s again?
I just wanted to see
if I could do better.
Man, you wouldn't know the truth
if it were staring you in the face.
Hello, Cornell. Good-bye, motive.
I still thought
Paul was an asshole,
but maybe he wasn't the kind of asshole
who'd steal the S.A.T.'s.
That sting wasn't my mouth.
I was starting to doubt my story.
Well done, Bobby.
You got into the Northwestern program.
Wait. One more thing.
Some grad student, Striedel,
will be in contact to fact-check the article.
It's just a formality.
You're on your way.
Sure I was on my way, to the gallows.
If I didn't set the story straight before the
fact-checker found something crooked,
Northwestern would go south,
and then I'd be blacklisted from every paper
and college journalism program...
in the country.
And school suspension...
cruel and unusual punishment reserved
solely for dangerous offenders.
Rocky was
on permanent lockdown...
for doing a custom paint job

I'm gonna need

You got three.
Aren't you supposed

- Maybe you should've done that sooner.
Where were you that night?
You think it's that easy?
You think I can just tell you and it's
gonna set it all straight?
Take a look
around you, Funky.
- I'm screwed now no matter what I say.
- Then just tell me the truth.
If you didn't do it,
I'm all you got.
And you only got me
for one more minute, so spill it.
Come on.
Last year I did some things

Twice last season.
It was two times too many, and I only did it
'cause I needed the money.
- What for?

When I was approached this year,
I turned 'em down.
We had a shot at State. I wasn't gonna mess

I can't help you.
- You've got to give me his name now.
- Start thinking with your head.
Do you know the amount of power
that comes with the presidency?
- Everybody wants a piece of me.
- All right. Time's up, Funky.
You're getting the animals
all riled up.
What's his name, Moore?
- Look, I said time's up.
- Give me his name.
- Come on.
- What's his name?
- Freddy Bismark.
- Where do I find him? Moore!
Bobby Funky,
please report to the office immediately.
- Hello?
- Robert Funky?
Hey. Yeah. Well, actually,
it's pronounced "Funk."
No, it's not.
This is Ben Striedel at Northwestern University.
I'm fact-checking
your story here, chief.
- It's not bad. Not exactly good either.
- Excuse me?
So I'm gonna need
the following from you.
Transcriptions of your interviews,
a bibliography,
M.L.A. Style match, your notes, pretty much
anything pertaining to the story.
Ah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Um, I'm just gonna need some time to get it
together.
So can I get
your number or something?
No.
What? Hello?
I had to find Freddy Bismark,
and there was one place I knew I could track
down even the most elusive characters.
It's freaky, isn't it?
Apparently, they just got results
back from the S.A.T.'s.
- Some of our best and brightest bummed it.
- Really?
- You see Shamus Finnle over there?
- Uh-huh.
His teeth are chattering.
It's probably
from the Prylert.
Oh, really? I didn't know
that Shamus had A.D.D.
For a reporter, you're really
out of the loop.
Half the school
is taking Prylert right now...
or Axitol, Ripenol,
maybe Faldox.
All just nice words
for speed.
If a kid needs a study aid,
he'll find a way to get one.
- Shamus Finnle.
- It's supply and demand, son.
I found Bobby Bismark
where all high school graduates...
go on to live in infamy.
They say a picture
is worth a thousand words,
but his senior quote
is worth a goddamn encyclopedia.
"Dollar,
dollar bills, y'all."
You're not supposed to be looking at that.
It's called study hall
because you're supposed to study.
What are you, a cop?
♪
Ah, I'm looking
for the business.
♪
And no. No,
you cannot pay me back on your meal card.
I need cash.
This is a business I'm running.
I know it's your bar mitzvah money,
but I have to take it.
You lost the bet.
Yes. I will take...
Yes, I'll take a check.
But if it bounces, I'm coming after you.
This is real stuff.
You owe me 20 bucks. Good-bye.
Uh, I'm sorry. We're closed for the semester.
No more pledges.
I'm here
about Paul Moore.
Suck it! Let me explain
something to you.
I don't know
thing one about Paul Moore.
His name
means nothing to me.
I have kids on over
half the teams in this district.
And most pill poppers
are begging me to throw games.
And if I had to go out
and personally frame each one...
that didn't wanna
brick a layup for me,
I wouldn't have time
to spend the money that I make.
And as you can see,
I like spending the money that I make.
I mean, look around.
That painting is from the Sixteenth chapel.
That's the first
chapel ever.
So, what was the money for?
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
slap you in the face.
I don't know.
He was having girl problems.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- He was having problems with girls. All right?
Come on.
For a fellow Friar?
No. Not for a fellow Friar.
For you to get the fuck out of here. Okay?
It was some chick
from McKinley. That's all I know.
Now, I'll see you, little man.
Don't hurt yourselves.
If Freddy Bismark didn't frame Paul,
then maybe the girl problem
was behind it.
- There's the ol' wise guy.
- Elliot.
- Those pubes come in yet?
- You still eating your mom's dirty tampons?
- Only when I'm hungry.
- So as I was saying on the phone,
I managed to implicate
our school president in a sordid theft...
and in the process
steal his girlfriend.
- So what's the problem?
- Bitch.
I'm not sure the guy did it anymore.
Have you ever seen
this guy around?
Yeah. That's
Valerie's boyfriend.
- You're dating Valerie?
- The plot thickens, Elliot.
Oh, I get it, peach fuzz.
You think maybe I got tired of being Paul's little
plaything, thought I'd teach him a lesson.
It wasn't like that.
- What... What do you mean?
- Paul and I have something real. Okay?
He can be himself around me.
So what was
the money for then?
That's got nothing
to do with anything.
Look, Valerie,
if Paul's innocent,
then you can help him by helping me.
Okay. You ready
for the after-school special they call my life?
I owed money
to some unpleasant people.
They were ready to collect
on me as interest.
Paul wouldn't
stand for it.
Someone tells me
about Freddy Bismark.
Paul has two off nights.
- My debt goes away.
- Paul threw two games for you?
He would've thrown
the entire season if I asked him to.
Valerie was another dead end.
If Paul
was keeping her a secret,
I wondered what else
he was holding back on.
I know some of you kids know...
that I fought
in Desert Storm.
And you know why?
I fought for you kids,
and I fought
for this country and this school,
for St. Donovan's.
It's no joke.
Sometimes... I don't know...
I may get carried away.
But I wrote this song last night.
Sing it with me.
You can sing it.
You can march. Yeah.
Come on, kids.
Sing it with me.

And on that note,
St. Donovan's...
Marlon Piazza.
For far too long we've
stood as a school divided.
Today, let us stand together.
Let's create
a better tomorrow.
As I stand here today,
I don't see freshmen or sophomores.
I see Friars!
- Marlon, can you hear me?
- It's a paintball, you pussy.

I'm gonna go to the
vending machine for some pretzels.
Do you want anything
from downstairs?
How about a bandage?
Forget it.
- Nurse Platt's phone.
- I got word your boy shot some kids.
How does that sit with the facts of your story,
I'd like to ask, Funky?
Striedel?
How the hell did you...
I have not... yes, yes... have not
received your notes on the story, boss.
Well, yeah, I know. I've been doing some-some
backtracking to, you know, locate everything.
Backtracking, huh? There was a kid a few
years back, said he was doing backtracking.
Turned out he fabricated
the whole story to get into the program.
They kicked him out, of course.
Blackballed him.
Last I heard, he was working as a pharma-
ceutical test subject for carpel tunnel syndrome.
Your story's thin, kid. Do you really think you
can pull one over on Ben Striedel?
I want your notes, stat.
Hey.
There's, um, something
that I need to tell you.
Not before I get
to say thank you.
For what?
For saving
my life out there.
It was just a paintball gun.
Yeah, but you didn't
know that, did you?
Look, Francesca,
as an ethical journalist
and a man who's dedicated to the truth,
I think you should know that
your boyfriend was probably...
He's not my boyfriend.
Now, what did you
want to tell me?
Nice shooting out there,
Mr. Moore.
Another three inches to the left and you would
have had a kill shot on me.
You got this all wrong.
I didn't steal the S.A.T.'s.
- Anything else?
- Yeah. This place sucks!
Oh, you'll be sucking
soon enough, Mr. Moore.
# I got the hots for you
They locked Paul away at
some undisclosed private institution.
My story put him there.
Now it was my job to get him out.
# I got the hots for you
I'll tell you whatever
you want to know.
# Here I am

Meds three times a day.
P.M.W.
Paul Moore Way.
Paul, I need your help.
I know someone framed you
for stealing the S.A.T.'s,
but I just
don't know who.
Who do you think
framed you?
Who set you up?
Come on, Paul.
Are you here
to take me home?
After three hours,
the only thing I got out of Paul was
a sinking feeling in my stomach.
All right, Mitch,
we're looking for weapons, obviously,
anything that
can kill a student.
Knives, guns,
what's not always obvious.
Are you kidding me?
You know about the rule about gum!
Raise your arms, please. With the women, you
want to use the backs of the hands.
The backs of the hands, Mitch.
Last rule, most important rule.
You're gonna wanna fuck 'em.
Do not fuck the students.
Do you understand?
The scene of the crime.
Give a lunatic a paintball gun
and you'd expect a Jackson Pollack.
But Paul was more precise.
Every shot counted.
But for what? Francesca?
That's easy. She broke his heart.
Me? I broke the story.
Kirkpatrick, mercy killing.
But what about Alex Schneider,
the school treasurer?
What about Marlon
and the Mullens?
They were his friends and fellow
members of the student council.
If Paul's painting meant something,
maybe those guys could explain it to me.
Yo, check it out.
It's that slut, Laura Hoffman.
Oh, dude, you don't even want to know
what I did to that ass.
Probably the same thing
I did to your mom's ass.
Dude, that's mom. Our mom.
Yeah. No. Yo, check it out.
I got this move that
I like to call the "operator."
Right? It's when I'm,
uh, railing a girl.
Then I reach down
and steal her cell phone...
and call up her dad
so he can listen to me do her.
Oh, yeah, Daddy.
Oh, yes, man.
- Are you lost, freshman?
- Son of a bi...
- Why'd he shoot you, Marlon?
- He shot you too, didn't he?
- Yeah, but he shot you first.
- Hey, you want detention for life, fuck-face?
Hey, Funky, why don't you, uh...
why don't you come to my house on Friday?
- I'm gonna have a little party.

- No, it's my mom's.
Connect the dots.
I told you not to line up
the ships like that.
It's looks like,
uh, Pearl Harbor!
- Puta!
- Could you guys just use your library voices?
Sorry. I'm just
trying to think.
You can't let Goltz
get one up on you, Funky.
That guy is
an enormous vagina.
Connect the dots.
Connect them. Come here.
Connect the...
What are you looking at,
Funky?
Funky, where you go?
These four walls, you just stay. Bounce.
Bing-bing-bing-bing-bing. Like a pinball.
That's it. You can't run.
Hey, hall monitor!

Mathematically, it's a percentage of your life.
Four years. 48 months.
1,461 days.
High school is prom, football games,
boyfriends, girlfriends,
party at the rich kid's house,
fun, simple, wholesome.
But it's really anything but.
High school might be the least
wholesome four years of your life,
and there's nothing
simple about it.
High school is ugly,
hard and complicated,
as complicated as a conspiracy
to assassinate the president.
A conspiracy about to be uncovered.
Alex Schneider and the Mullen brothers...
had been selling prescription drugs
since their sophomore year.
The Mullens' dad was an orthopedist
with a habit of boning his patients.
When he split with one of them,
the hip doctor left his family
his van and a box of prescription pads.
The brothers made due
with their inheritance.
# Your booty is the ice
I'm the Zamboni #
The Mullens weren't
competent enough to run things on their own.
Yo, shit biscuit!
These bottles aren't gonna fill themselves.
Initially, the market
for academic performance enhancers...
wasn't as ripe
as they'd hoped.
So like good businessmen,
they created a demand.
They sabotaged tests
throughout the school,
targeting the students they knew
would fold from the pressure.
If you erase enough bubbles,
you can erase a kids future.
It's supply and demand, son.
Business boomed,
so much so that they started dipping into
student council funds to use as venture capital.
P. Moore wasn't exactly
Alan Greenspan.
But it didn't take
an economic genius to figure out...
that hundreds of dollars
were being shifted around weekly.
Paul told Marlon
what he'd discovered,
said he was gonna put
the kibosh on Alex's creative accounting.
Marlon couldn't have that.
Things were too good.
He had big plans,
and the president was in the way.
He needed Paul
out of the picture.
# Yeah, you close my eyes
# Yeah, you close my eyes #
- What's going on, guys?
- Funky...
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?
Guess not. Gum?
Changing the answers on the S.A.T.'s so you
can sell more drugs. It's clever, Marlon.
Twisted, but clever
nonetheless.
Should make for a great story.
Bad move, Funky.
Open that window
and bring him over.
Okay, here's the real story.
Bobby Funky made a few bad decisions,
lost his girlfriend and up
and jumped out the window.
- Just another tormented freshman.
- I'm a sophomore, dick!
- Throw his ass out.
- You won't do it.
Oh, I won't? These sorts of
things happen all the time.
There's a lot of pressure
here at St. Donovan's.
Throw him out!
Fine. I'll do it myself.
- Hey! Let him go!
- Hey, hey! Ahh! Ahh! Calmate.
Put him down!
Delicately.
- How'd they know you were here?
- I might have made an announcement.
Funky.
Bob Woodward once said
that the first rule of good journalism...
is never reveal the story
before it goes to print.
But Woodward wasn't in love
with Francesca Fachini.
Before I cleared my name with the school,
I had to clear it with her.
I had to tell her
I'd figured it all out.
# Pick us up
- Turns out, I hadn't.
# We're all by ourselves
# The great big howling is
- # About to begin
- You played me, Francesca.
- You played Paul.
- # A thousand miles from where #
You played
the whole damn school.
Look out! Look out!
Look out!
I need everybody to file
out of this office.
Everybody except you five.
The five of you are
in big fucking trouble.
Stay right there.
Get out of my way. You too, bonehead.
You'll never understand
why I did it.
Nobody's misunderstood,
Francesca.
It's just what people say
when they don't like who they are.
Bobby, wait.
Forget it, Funky.
It's high school.
