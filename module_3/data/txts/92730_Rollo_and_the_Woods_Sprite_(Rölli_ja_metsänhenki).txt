ROLLI
Lackey and Cacophony!
The map and the sextant.
On my way, just a moment.
Here, your Grace.
Knobbly and Rolli, check the beach.
The beach?
Rolli, it seems like my dream
is coming true.
Help!
There.
Silence!
We don't know fear.
We are trolls.
Well said!
That's right, we're terrible trolls.
-Exactly.
Onwards now.
Bravely towards a foreign land!
Wait! That was really well put.
'Towards a foreign land'.
Thank you!
We're trolls looking for home
You'd better watch out and bow
A land where rivers of milk
Can be found
Where treasure chests
Lie in the ground
The trolls aren't afraid of wars
We're heroes looking for
Welcoming doors
Flee!
-Into hiding! Into hiding!
Strangers!
Grass w on't grow
Where trolls have been
Our drums will terrify all enemies
Lackey!
-Yes, Your Highness?
Someone's snoring.
Over there.
-Who's there?
l don't believe this.
What sort of troll are you?
Up from there!
Well, isn't it just luscious.
And what's worse,
it's even more precious over here.
Good day, good morning.
What lovely hair you have.
Look children, it's friendly.
Pass me my ocular.
-Here you are, Chief.
l wonder if we're in Africa.
This is the moment
l've been waiting for.
Finally l can say
0ur journey was not in vain.
There's a forest and a village,
just as in my dream.
What kind of a village?
-Can you see any movement?
There's no-one there.
Onwards!
Goodbye.
-Let's not rush now.
Sound the alarm!
-Sound the alarm!
Sound the alarm!
-Sound the alarm!
There...
-What is it?
There are monsters coming this way.
-They looked really horrendous.
Let's all just calm down.
Monsters don't exist.
Unless...
Look, they're coming.
What shall we do?
-We'd better run. Retreat!
Oh dear, excuse me.
Isn't it slippery.
Careful children.
Don't step on any tails.
There's something strange
about this silent village -
and its four-legged inhabitants.
There's nothing strange about it.
This is exactly what our Chief saw
in his dream, you fool.
There's something strange here.
Rolli! Where on earth do you think
you're going again?
You hairy faces can sleep side
by side. I want to loll in peace.
I've heard all that be fore!
Go find yourself a place
like the rest of us -
and stop going solo, you hippie.
You think you're something special,
don't you?
Hey everybody, there's a sauna here!
-A sauna!
It's horrifying and unpleasant
and hot! -A smoke sauna!
Does it make your eyes sting? Great.
-This is excellent!
Upon my mud gruel and porridge!
Home.
I shall make that my home.
Veggies...
Nice.
What's he doing?
-Leave him be.
But this is your home.
Let's go.
You darned gadget,
won't you just stop?
Darned rattletrap.
Of all the things in this world.
Good morning.
Will you not stop,
you darned thing?
A very essential gadget
but a bit annoying at times.
Is it nice?
Yes, and lots more.
There's everything here.
This village is made for us.
Isn't it beautiful?
So beautiful it's almost horrible!
Terrible day to you, Your Horror.
-Hello.
The eyepiece, does it work alright?
-Yes, l see well and clear.
Come on, Rolli.
-Must go to work now.
My dearest adviser.
l feel my mission
has been completed now.
Yes...
You brought us to this new village -
and you must be as tired as Moses,
l understand that...
That must have hurt!
What's with those two?
I've followed
the life of the troll tribe -
longer than any of you.
And, now I'm going to leave you.
My time has come.
Are you going to snuff it
just like that?
I'm going to rest.
The tribe leader
has always carried this sceptre.
You must now choose a new leader.
A new Old Chief.
But choose wisely.
I must take my leave now.
What's going to become of us
without you?
Upon my filthy toes!
What do my snotty eyes see?
What on earth are you?
Did you scoff up our Old Chief?
Don't you dare wiggle your wattle,
you winkle-eyed long neck!
Of all the things in the world.
ln accordance
to our old chief's wishes -
we will have
a just and democratic election -
and choose a new leader
from amongst us.
There are two candidates
for the post.
Applause, please.
Let me introduce
the respected adviser -
of our sorely missed Old Chief.
Lackey.
Wait a minute.
Why am I not mentioned?
Surprisingly there's a new candidate
for the post of Old Chief - Big.
Let me go!
That's right.
This time there's only one candidate
for the post. That's Big.
Wrong! I was a candidate for
the post and I still am a candidate.
I most certainly am.
-No, you're not.
No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.
That hurt!
Well, Knobbly.
Who will be the new Chief?
Big, of course.
-Exactly.
Fine, that's 1-0.
Earnest?
-Big.
Good. Doc?
-Big.
Bluster?
-Big.
That's right. Face?
-Big.
Right. Merchant?
-Big.
This is not right,
there's some mischief going on.
How about you,
what do you think?
You'd be a good choice, Cacophony.
-Write that down.
But naturally I vote for Big.
-Attention, attention!
Don't you get it?
You voters are being provoked
and manipulated.
Your behaviour is being controlled.
Don't you get it?
You fools,
you pigheaded ugly twats!
You can choose who you like.
You'll get what you deserve.
And you, you brainless boor -
you thick-headed buck-eyed seal -
you hairy-faced monster tyrant -
can't you get it? That rat
is using you, you idiot.
That's enough,
I don't need to listen to this.
Oh dear, good heavens,
goodness gracious me!
Where have you been? I've been
looking for you every where.
Have you now?
-Listen, I've witnessed a miracle.
The Old Chief
turned into a bird-thing.
Oops, and he disappeared.
Another oops, and he was a bird.
You're the one who's a bird here,
y0u magpie.
You didn't vote for me,
you croaking hairy-eared gap-tooth.
And you call yourself my friend.
But I am your friend.
-Bah.
What a nice hat you have there.
Is it a real turban?
-A turban... Oh, right...
Trolls, you goggle-eyed creatures,
show some respect for the new Chief.
Do act your rank, you elephant.
Your lovely big Grace, the headpiece
only emphasises your status.
Like this. A tad of dignity,
if I may suggest.
Trolls, our new leader
will make a speech now.
Speak.
Say something. Is there
a ruff in your throat, or what?
Is that frog spawn in your throat?
Swallow!
Say something, do you hear?
That's not very nice.
-Far too nasty.
Absolutely.
Patience, please. He's thinking.
Go on now, idiot.
Big guy and such a mute.
Speak.
Like a tall pine tree
Standing so alone
A troll withering, gathering moss
His heart as hollow as hole
Small ones won't dare to grin
When a bigger man is singing
They'd better try
And save their skin
If they're caught grinning
Who dares?
A troll's longing is dangerous
His guts are practically smoking
Where can he put all his loving?.
It's in his heart, it's bulging
A troll's longing is dangerous
His guts are practically smoking
Where c an he put all his loving?.
It's in his heart, it's bulging
A troll's longing is dangerous
His guts are practically smoking
I don't believe this!
Stop your jumping and yodling.
Look, they're green.
What kind of creeps are you?
We're sorry to bother you,
fine strangers.
We'd like to show our hospitality
with these modest gifts.
Creeps.
-We ain't no creeps.
We're no creeps.
-What?
We are just regular elves.
We live in this village.
We welcome you to our forest
and our village.
We've observed you from a far
and come to the conclusion -
that we could live as friends.
-Shut up, freaky pixie.
We're trolls and this village is
now ours. There's no room for you.
Get out, go away!
-That's not fair.
What? Trolls, drive those disgusting
wimpy pukes out of our village.
Shout and bellow
and toss them about!
Growl and bluster!
You, fat boy, show them!
Prance about, go on now!
And you flakey...
We understand.
We don't want a fight. We'll leave.
Farewell then, you terrible trolls.
What weird creeps.
Buggery bug and all that.
Holy moly, they're elves
living in the forest.
We find a home
and it's somebody else's home.
Oh dear, oh dear...
Old Chief goes away
and turns into a turkey.
Cacophony gets a turban
and Big becomes the new Chief.
Hop! Lift it up!
Millie, stop.
Where are you off to?
-To the forest to see the trolls.
Listen. You're brave
and think the best of everyone -
but those creatures are different.
-Why would they want to hurt us?
We haven't done anything to them.
-They drove us from our own village.
There's room for all of us
in the forest.
I'll talk some sense into them.
Millie the Elf.
Thank you.
Go.
Do the trolls really think -
they can scare me off
with something like this?
You darned thing.
Won't you be quiet,
you darned contraption?
Darned gadget, be quiet!
Hullo!
Now we have you, you green thing!
Aha, I hear the wind in the willows.
Oh right, big guy.
Give it to me, darling.
Catch!
Hey, what's up?
Catch her!
Move it, fatty.
Get a move on!
Out with the flab, get her!
You smelly elf,
we got you now.
Who dares to disturb
my serious thoughts?
What..?
-Hi.
A muddy tangle-haired thing?
-Could l have some water?
Well, why not? You look like
a decent enough fellow.
Slurp up.
No, l meant that
l'd like to wash my face.
You're joking, right?
Jeez, trolls don't wash.
My goodness, you're pretty.
Were you born that way
or did you have an accident?
What sort of creature are you
any way?
I'm Millie, Millie the Elf.
Don't you remember me?
I for one remember you well.
I thought that maybe
the two of us could be friends.
Don't you know
that us terrible trolls -
could never socialize
with nice creatures?
Get out of here,
before someone sees you!
I think you're nice.
-Nice... How can you be so daft?
Go on, get out now!
I haven't seen a thing,
I've been sound asleep all the time.
How can you sleep
in the middle of a day?
I've always been good in bed.
Off you go now!
You've got a cold.
I'll make you some lichen tea...
No, you most certainly will not!
Just get out.
How about lizard's tail soup?
Can you make lizard's tail soup?
Go on, have some gruesome gourmet,
slimy and wobbly.
Listen...
-Yes?
This house is my home.
My own...
-Home sweet home.
Where's your appetite?
Why can't you trolls and us elves
live together in harmony?
That's just the way it is. What?
You elves have different habits
than us trolls.
I bet you dance and hug each other.
-Why do you say that?
Watch. Like this.
Sludge...
Smells like elves.
That way, brothers!
This, nice!
Tip tap tip tap tipe tipe tip tap
Christmas brownies on their toes
On their toes
They're dancing!
I think you're very nice.
-Bah, nice.
What are you staring at?
Drag him out of there.
What's going on?
Do something!
Stay put.
My trousers, they're dropping!
Save the box and the food -
and the clocks, the coat
and the grinder. Get out of my way!
Good day to all, good day to all
To all men and women as well
Stop, you garlic-breath turncoat!
And that stinking elf, too!
My tail is getting wet.
-Onwards!
Hurry up, Millie!
I'll go first.
Watch out, Millie!
Come here, you hairy ears!
-They're coming.
There they are,
there they are hanging!
And easily over.
Swinging!
Stop, come here.
Well done, Millie.
Just you wait,
and I'll feather you.
That's some great swinging.
Take the rope.
-Don't wobble the line!
Don't swing, you twat.
Float, fat boy.
I've got a fish bone
in my throat. I'm exhausted.
You folks are nothing but trouble.
One shouldn't socialize with elves,
all I got was torn trousers.
Here you are.
I'm sorry for causing you trouble,
Rolli.
What are you looking at?
-I feel something.
I feel I know a lot of things, too.
You're so out of it,
you're almost walking into trees.
Silly you.
Millie, let's not go there.
Let's get out of here.
-Are you scared?
Listen, I've seen folks coming
here to sit in peace.
It's not normal.
Our Old Chief just sat over there
like a mushroom.
This is an ancient resting place.
It's not normal to rest
one moment -
and turn into a bird the next.
Listen.
Bah.
What's this here contraption?
This is a pair of scales.
-Oh bugger. Scales!
A lot of screwing and hammering
has gone into that.
Who are you?
-I'm Master of the Scales.
How do you do?
-How do you do, I guess.
Such a comfy place.
Must be expensive.
What do you measure with this?
-Do you like birds? I'll show you.
They're lovely.
They like you.
Do you like birds, too?
-I don't really know.
They can turn into any odd thing -
or you can turn into one
yourself.
There's something fishy
going on here.
This is becoming a little too weird.
There's something familiar
about that bird.
I'll leave even if you don't.
Let's go.
Is the tube broken for good?
Water...
I don't believe this.
It's Rolli! Wake up!
Peace, brothers.
-Where's the elf, you traitor?
What elf?
I've got you now.
What's up, Big?
-You're in for a good spanking.
Come and fight, you plums!
-Catch her!
Should I go home now?
I've had enough commotion
for one day. Well put.
This has nothing to do with me.
Here's one for you, and here,
and here. Come here!
Well?
What is it?
What's keeping me awake?
Must be a full moon coming up.
Alright, brothers!
We'll sling the alien back
to the elf camp -
but first I must make
some calculations.
Relation of mass to initial velocity
or was it the other way around?
Hey you ugly thing,
how much do you weigh?
It's rude to ask a girl's weight.
Have a guess.
Fine, we'll just test it and if it
goes wrong, we'll test it again.
Are you ready, Knobbly?
-Sure, I'm alway s ready.
Here we go then.
Ready... now!
That fell a bit short.
We must increase the momentum -
and change the direction
more to the left.
That'll give the elf a good ride.
That's nice. Mangare...
Put the pot on,
our leader's hungry.
He who meddles in other's affairs,
digs his own grave.
Oh grief and misery,
this won't end well.
Do I hear bells now
And lightning from the sky?
Have we at our service
Gods of rock and stone?
I know all the routes
Of fire and ice
We aren't here to lose
Oh no, we won't lose
I summon shadows and cold ice
Have I got power
More than others have?
Do I rule the sky
And stars and the moon?
I know all the routes
Of fire and ice
We aren't here to lose
Oh no, we won't lose
I summon shadows and cold ice
Unbelievable.
No-one's ever knocked Big out.
Rolli the Great, here's the sceptre.
You're our new leader.
I'm your humble servant.
Right...
I've been expecting you.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I feel that things are not
quite right in the forest.
So I decided to come
and ask for help.
Look at the scales.
They measure good and evil.
I always carry them with me.
Do you really live in this cottage?
In the forest?
I was just passing by -
but I stayed because
I'm worried about you all.
What are the birds, then?
-They're my friends.
They tell me
what's going on in the forest.
Would you like to help me?
We could work together
to balance the scales.
If evil conquers the world -
a darkness will veil the forest.
An eternal darkness.
What can I do?
-Talk to your friend.
You could calm him down
and make him listen.
Tell him to act so that everyone
in the forest can live in peace.
Go.
How's this, Your Highness?
Is it nice?
Feels good, it's nice.
I could be your adviser now
that you're in such a high position.
I'm sure you need trustworthy advice
from a reliable source.
Good advice is priceless.
And the price is rarely right.
But I might make you my adviser.
-Thank you.
Holy moly!
-You can say that again.
Now I've seen it all.
-I agree. What do you say?
Great stick, eh?
-Where did you barmy bird get that?
Show a little respect, please.
I shall go and have a rest in
my chambers. Goodbye, subjects.
And a subject.
I simply must ask you
brainiacs -
what sort of nonsense is this?
Is this some..?
Go blow your horn, you trumpet.
Not in the face.
What an idiot.
Oh, it's you disturbing my sleep.
-Thank you, Rolli.
I'm being eaten alive here!
You are so brave.
Without you, I would have been
in serious trouble.
Never mind that,
there's nothing to mind.
Perhaps you could call me
Rolli the Great from now on.
You're not any greater than be fore.
-I guess you don't know yet -
that I've become the leader
of the trolls.
I'm a great emperor,
the conqueror of Big Troll!
I dance like a butterfly
and sting like a bee!
Pretty amazing.
Congratulations, Rolli.
Rolli the Great.
What will you do first?
-I might take a little nap.
Now you've got a chance
to make things right in the forest.
The elves aren't doing well in
the camp. The beach is not our home.
Can't we move back to the forest?
There's enough room for all of us.
Difficult, difficult...
My head aches.
You can take real responsibility
for the first time in your life.
I can't be expected to do that.
I'm far too young, I'm barely 400.
Besides, what do elves' problems
have to do with me? Good day.
Some people have
Nothing but air in their head
Fool leading fools
How else would it be
No good teaching etiquette
Better just to quit
We don't know what forks are for
We don't wear slippers at dawn
If you don't cease
that infernal racket -
I'll throw you into the pond
and feed you to herrings.
Or worse still, to piranhas.
Or worse still, I'll feed you my old
socks so that you'll choke on them.
How would you like that?
Stop!
Power is great.
Let go, my friend.
Let me down, you fool.
Good day my friend,
how are you today?
I'm not your friend.
I don't need to be anymore.
I choose my own friends.
Who am I again?
-You're Rolli the Great, your Grace.
Stop your shrieking, Cacophony,
I need to speak to you.
What is it?
I'm practicing my new song.
Let me practice in peace,
you muddle-headed carol singer.
Don't you call me names.
You should bow be fore me.
That's a good one.
You're killing me!
Can we come to your humble abode?
-Sure, come in.
You shall compose a song about me.
-Why of course, no problem.
I'd like to talk to you in private,
if that's okay.
Big, leave us for a minute,
will you?
Out! You buffalo.
Rolli.
I'm your best friend, aren't I?
Couldn't we agree that
you give the sceptre to me -
and we decide to make me
responsible for the tribe -
as was the original idea.
Remember what the Old Chief said.
He told us to choose wisely.
And then that bigheaded idiot
deprived me of a clear victory.
That's all true, but when
will you write my song?
I'll write an operetta, liberetta,
retretta and potpourri about you -
if you give that sceptre to
the only cultivated, sophisticated -
and tender-hearted troll.
Give me the sceptre,
I'm the King of the troll tribe.
Be sensible and give it to me.
-Thank you for your hospitality.
Friend, all you want is my sceptre.
My sceptre!
Millie! Millie the Elf!
Millie!
Thanks for the ride.
If you see Millie the Elf,
please tell her I said hello.
Have a good day.
By the hair of my ears...
Being a leader is a lonely job.
And where on earth is that elf?
You thieving elves,
dreaming spindleshanks -
nothing but robbers and thieves!
Alarm, alarm!
Thieving elves around!
My veggie patch has been robbed!
Where's my adviser?
These jerks do nothing but lounge
around. I never have time for that.
Get here, quick!
-I heard your call, sir.
The elves have been thieving
from my garden patch.
Indeed, they're nothing but trouble.
We must take action.
But really...
Isn't that a little too terrible?
Isn't it finally time to scare them
just a little bit? Isn't it?
Well said!
We'll grimace and frighten the elves
out of the forest.
As far as...
To where the peppercorn grows.
Listen, drums of war.
It's the trolls.
-I know their new leader.
We'll be fine.
-We can't negotiate with them.
And stars and the moon
We own the signs
Of fire and ice
We aren't here to lose
Oh no, we won't lose
I summon shadows and cold ice
Hurry, hurry.
Who's that smiling?
Hop, hop, hop...
Rolli!
-Hop, hop.
Rolli the Great!
Well, Millie the Bush.
Don't you see this is not
a good time to be seen with you?
This has gone too far.
How so?
-Master of the Scales warned me.
The scales have started to turn.
-Everything's turning nowadays.
Everything's turning,
turning turning turning
I fear we will all be
in great danger.
Silly silly and sally sally.
Master of the Scales said
that if evil wins -
eternal darkness
will fall upon the forest.
Well, isn't he so wise
and clever.
And lovely.
This is getting serious. Look!
Don't panic, my dear elves.
We must stay calm.
Trashy trolls,
hairy-faced good-for-nothings -
let's show the elves
who's who.
My proud Rolli-troops!
In a moment I shall fire up a flare.
We shall then attack and
scare the elves out of their wits.
We shall scream and wreak havoc
and grimace terrifyingly.
Well, shouldn't we be
attacking them already?
Go Big, that's great.
There's no need to go to extremes!
One should be careful
with that rattletrap.
Someone might get hurt.
-Isn't it about time we attacked.
That way, then it'll fall in the sea
and go out.
Go out...
Trickity trick and oops.
Oops!
-Halt the attack!
Oh horror of horrors,
such a new tent and all ablaze.
Flee, flee!
Run!
-Halt the attack!
Millie, I'm coming to help!
I'm coming!
-Rolli! Rolli!
Watch out, behind you!
It's getting dark here,
fantastic.
Do you miss your friend?
Just a little, not too much.
Not too much?
What do you most wish for, Rolli?
Is Millie now going to turn into
one of those wagtails or finches?
Is this all turning
into a feathery tale?
ls Millie now dead?
I'd like her as an elf.
-As an elf...
Wasn't it you trolls -
who wanted to drive
the elves and forest animals to...
To where the peppercorn grows.
-Exactly.
Aren't all living creatures equal?
Equally worthy and important.
Do you see, Rolli the Great,
that darkness has fallen?
If the light of the sun disappears,
all life will be gone.
What can I do to make things
as they were and to get Millie back?
You know what to do.
Good day or night,
or whatever it is.
No need to greet me.
You too, you vulture.
You gloat and poop on me.
I feel bad enough as it is.
Do you miss your friend?.
Not too much?
What do you most wish for?.
You know what to do.
Aren't all living creatures equal?.
Don't you remember me?
I thought the two of us
could be friends.
I'm glad you're there as an elf
and not as a willow tit.
I was afraid
you had turned into a bird.
That you'd be dead.
Look here.
Wouldn't you wake up.
Wouldn't you please wake up.
I'm so sorry, Millie.
I miss you.
I would have liked to have been
your friend.
Rolli!
Fair maiden walks through the woods
Her heart pounding in her chest
She wears a necklace round her neck
It's a beautiful gift
A boy waits for her impatiently
A similar jewel on his neck
The girl comes along the path
They meet again
Let the party begin
Under the moon
Let the party begin
The ground echoes with joy
Let's dance under the chain of stars
Let the party begin
On a bright night
Hey, let me come down,
I promise to be good.
Can you hear me?
Let me come down,
I can sing along.
La la la
The space so vast and immeasurable
Reflecting on our friends' eyes
Waves dancing ashore
Drops glisten on their faces
A high cliff reaches for the night
Let the party begin
Under the moon
Let the party begin
The ground echoes with joy
Let's dance under the chain of stars
Let the party begin
On a bright night
That's the way life is, right?
