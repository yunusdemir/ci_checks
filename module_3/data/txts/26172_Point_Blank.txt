<i>Cell.</i>
<i>Prison cell.</i>
<i>How'd I get here?</i>
<i>What you want, son? What you want?</i>
- I want my mama.
- Your mama?
Walker, let's get out of here.
I want to talk to you.
I want to talk to you,
Walker. It's important.
Come on, Walker. Come on.
- Now, you listen to me, Walker!
- Hey.
I need your help. Don't you
understand? I need your help.
What are you doing?
<i>Walker, they use the prison.</i>
<i>You know, it's closed.
We just wait.</i>
<i>We wait till they get it. And
then we take it from them.</i>
Now, you take the stuff.
I'll get the lights.
<i>- You're my friend, Walker.
- My friend.</i>
<i>- I can't make it on my own.
- Help my friend.</i>
- Trust me.
- What are we doing?
- What are we doing here?
- Trust me. Help me.
I hear it.
Early.
Hit them.
<i>I owe a bundle to some guys. They're
going to kill me if I don't get it.</i>
They're going to kill me if I don't get
it, Walker. They're going to kill me.
<i>We just hit him on the
head, and that's it.</i>
It's simple. We knock him
on the head and that's it.
- Hey!
- Walker!
- We made it.
- We blew it.
<i>We blew it.</i>
- Ten, 20...
- Twenty-four, 2000 in 20s.
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Will you shut up? I'm trying to count.
You coming, Lynne?
The boat won't be here for an hour.
Lynne.
- Darling.
- It's not as much as I thought.
Is it less than you need?
You better take care
of your husband.
How did we get into this mess?
I don't know.
Lynne.
Come here.
Take me away.
<i>Did it happen?</i>
<i>A dream?</i>
<i>A dream.</i>
<i>As we get closer to Alcatraz...</i>
<i>notice the treacherous
currents around the island...</i>
<i>rendering it virtually
escape-proof.</i>
<i>The water temperature is
usually around 50 degrees.</i>
<i>In its 29 years as a
federal penitentiary...</i>
<i>the one thing that obsessed its
prisoners and plagued its wardens...</i>
<i>was escape.</i>
<i>In 1936, the first escape attempt
was made by a prisoner...</i>
<i>who was almost into the bay
before he was discovered.</i>
<i>In 1937, two prisoners
actually got off the island.</i>
<i>Because of the dense fog
and strong tides...</i>
<i>it is assumed that they
were washed out to sea.</i>
<i>There has never been a
trace of them found.</i>
<i>On June 12th, 1962...</i>
<i>three men dug their way out of the
cell block using small teaspoons.</i>
<i>They left dummies, which they
had created in their cells...</i>
<i>and managed to get off the island.</i>
<i>They have never been
heard of since.</i>
How did you make it, Walker?
<i>In 1946, the historic "Battle
of Alcatraz" took place.</i>
<i>Two convicts had managed
to overpower their guards...</i>
<i>and took over the main cell block
releasing those prisoners still in cells.</i>
<i>They had nine hostages.</i>
<i>During the two days of
siege, the Coast Guard...</i>
Using "The Rock"...
<i>- ...and the San Francisco Police...</i>
- ...for a drop.
<i>- ...a detachment of Marines...</i>
- Fuzz.
<i>- ...guarded the prisoners still in the...</i>
- I'm Yost.
Are you making a charge?
No, no, no.
I want something else.
<i>...the police riddled with
rifle and shotgun fire.</i>
<i>After the 48-hour break, two officers
and three prisoners were dead.</i>
I... I want the organization.
<i>The last escape attempt
from Alcatraz...</i>
Your friend Reese?
He's in the big time now.
Suits...
penthouses.
He bought his way back in...
with the money he stole from you.
<i>None were ever heard from again.</i>
<i>And all indications point to their
being swept with the tide...</i>
<i>out through the Golden
Gate to a watery grave.</i>
<i>Alcatraz, often
called "The Rock"...</i>
<i>- ...was actually privately...</i>
- Ninety-three thousand, wasn't it?
- Ninety-three.
- Ninety-three.
You want Reese...
and I want the organization.
<i>Workman was supposed to
establish a light...</i>
You understand?
<i>...protection to the
ships and small...</i>
I'm going to help you. And
you're going to help me.
<i>The island was eventually sold...</i>
That's your wife's
address in Los Angeles.
<i>- ...for the sum of $5000 in 1849.</i>
- Reese lives there too.
<i>In 1854, the United States Army
began to fortify Alcatraz.</i>
Walker, Reese isn't here.
He's gone.
Three months ago.
Gone. Cold.
Moved out.
Walker.
I'm glad you're not dead.
It's true. I really am.
You ought to kill me.
I can't sleep.
Haven't slept.
I keep taking pills.
I dream about you.
How good it must be...
being dead.
Is it?
No.
No, I can't.
I never had the courage.
This?
Payoff, I guess.
I don't know where he
is, I really don't.
Money?
A guy brings it the
first of every month.
A thousand.
A thousand.
Always a different guy.
No contact with Mal.
Just couldn't make
it with you, Walker.
With him, it was...
kind of fun.
Just drifted into it.
That night on Alcatraz...
I knew it was you I really wanted.
I found out too late.
<i>Do you remember when we met?</i>
<i>The rain?</i>
<i>You were a little drunk.</i>
<i>So was I.</i>
<i>You were funny when you were drunk.</i>
<i>Strange.</i>
<i>I don't remember very much...</i>
<i>but suddenly...</i>
<i>we were together.</i>
<i>It was wonderful at first.</i>
<i>I loved you.</i>
<i>Then, Mal happened.</i>
<i>You talked a lot about Mal.</i>
<i>Mal Reese.</i>
<i>He was very real for
me, until I met him.</i>
<i>That night, at the reunion...</i>
<i>when you found Mal again
and brought him home.</i>
<i>The two of you together.</i>
<i>Then it was the three of us.</i>
<i>Laughing.</i>
<i>It was...</i>
<i>It was perfect.</i>
<i>And...</i>
<i>I think I was happier then,
than any other time.</i>
<i>I seemed to be floating
between the two of you.</i>
<i>Suddenly, I began to
drift toward Mal.</i>
<i>And I...</i>
<i>I just went with him.</i>
<i>Lynne.</i>
<i>Come here.</i>
Hey, come on. I got
something nice for you.
Hey. Who...? Listen.
- "Only Miss Walker," they said.
- "'Only Miss Walker, ' they said."
- I gotta call them.
- You gotta call them.
No.
- I can't.
- You can't...?
- Because they'll kill me.
- They'll kill you?
- Yeah. Big John will kill me.
- Big John?
John Stegman. Big John's Car Lot.
This guy's got a car lot.
Stegman.
What's the dog's name?
- Lola.
- Lola?
- Yes. She's a girl.
- Your dog's name is Lola.
- What's your name?
- Miss Stewart.
Well, Miss Stewart, what
do you think of this car?
- Oh, I like it very much.
- It's a good buy.
A one-owner car, a lady
from Beverly Hills...
- Mr. Stegman?
- Yes, sir.
That's me.
- I'm looking for a car.
- Take your pick, friend.
- What have you got in mind?
- I like a clean model...
What'd you say?
What about this one?
Beautiful car. Beautiful car.
- It costs a lot of money.
- I've got a lot of money.
- Yes, but...
- Every pretty girl that comes in...
right away I'm giving a car away.
What kind do you want?
- Somebody recommend you?
- Mal Reese.
- Good. You wanna take a spin?
- Okay.
Aren't you going to introduce
this lovely lady to your boss?
Yes, sir. This is my boss.
- Well, hello.
- How do you do? Glad to meet you.
You ready to go for a little spin?
- She's committed herself.
- Where shall we go?
- Anywhere you say.
- I know.
- Let's go to the beach.
- Great.
I've got to go. I'll
be back in 20 minutes.
- Good.
- Okay.
- Don't go away.
- Don't worry.
- I'll be right back.
- Yes.
- Fall in love?
- Yeah. Pretty nice rig, eh?
You don't really need that.
Most accidents happen
within three miles of home.
True. True.
Well, what do you want for it?
See if you like it, and we'll
work out a deal. Okay?
It's the headlight, electric.
Kind that flop over.
- Yeah.
- Take a look, right up that line...
and picture yourself
behind that wheel.
- Mind if I hear my commercial?
- No. Go right ahead.
Stereo. Pretty good, huh?
How's the power steering work, huh?
Hey. Get it over.
Are you crazy?
- Where can I find Reese?
- What's he got to do with this?
- What are you doing to my car?
- What I did to your delivery boy.
- What are you talking about?
- Tell me.
I can't tell you. I can't think.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it.
- Who the hell are you?
- My name's Walker.
- Where do I find Reese?
- I've got nothing to do with Reese.
I know about you, Walker.
How's your wife?
- She'd dead.
- And her sister?
Chris? What about her?
She's with Reese now.
He nailed both sisters.
How does that grab you?
Where's Reese?
<i>Big John loves cars.
Come on in. Pay us a visit.</i>
- Get up.
<i>- We've got a 1960, four-door...</i>
Where's Chris?
She runs a club.
A place called the Movie House.
<i>Unconditionally and fully guaranteed.
You'll love my guarantee.</i>
<i>Now come on in. Come on
in to Big John's Car Lot.</i>
<i>Remember, Big John loves cars.
You'll love my guarantee.</i>
<i>You'll love my cars at Big John's.</i>
Did I exaggerate, hm?
- He did that, huh?
- With me, in it.
- You're sure it was him?
- It was him.
- Tall? Big man?
- I know him, Mal.
- You didn't tell him anything?
- I didn't.
- Now, would I tell him anything.
- You sure you told him nothing.
This says I didn't, and
this says I didn't.
- Then why didn't he kill you?
- He killed the car.
You didn't give him
something? A name?
I told him you were in Frisco.
Smart boy.
Just don't hold out on me.
You can trust me, Mal.
You had him, and you let him go.
Now, find him again.
- Find him?
- I don't care how you do it. Just do it.
- Mal, come on.
- Shut up.
Now, you find him.
You finish him.
- How are you, Sandy?
- Walker. You still alive?
Are you?
- Where's Chris?
- She's off tonight.
Write down her address for me, huh?
- Thought I'd see you.
- Oh, why?
Some guy, asking for you.
Is there another way
out of this joint?
Back of the stage.
Sandra.
See you around, huh?
Do.
Walker.
Where's Reese?
You're supposed to be
dead. Lynne said so.
She's dead.
Lynne.
- You?
- No, her.
- Those.
- I'm not sleeping.
- I heard you're running with Reese.
- Well, you heard wrong.
Does he want you?
- Sure he does.
- Do you want him?
- He makes my flesh crawl.
- I want him.
You were always the
best thing about Lynne.
Why don't you want him?
I don't want any of them, Walker.
I was going with a guy...
who owned a club. Jazz club.
- Yeah, the Movie House.
- It was different then.
It was a good jazz club.
The organization wanted to...
Wanted to become his partner.
And...
- And?
- And he...
Killed him.
I run it. I run the club now.
Oh, boy, do I pay him.
- You know, I loved him.
- Why?
Pay.
Gotta make a living.
The organization.
And Mal Reese.
What do you want from me, Walker?
Reese. He owes me money.
Lynne and money.
Fix your face.
I've got room, you can
stay if you want.
Reese.
I'll get him for you.
- Well?
- Nothing.
I've had guys out all night
looking for him. Not a sign of him.
Everything humanly possible, Mal.
- See you at noon.
- You...
Don't get lost.
Yes? Yes, Mr. Carter.
You can go in now, Mr. Reese.
You can go in now, Mr. Reese.
The usual formalities,
Mr. Reese. Nice and high.
There you go.
Three copies to them and
two up to Santa Barbara.
- Three to Santa Barbara?
- I said, two.
What are you fooling
around with now, Reese?
There's a lot at stake, Mr. Carter.
That's why I came to you.
- That's why I must...
- Must? There's no must about it.
I'd be grateful for
anything you could do.
You're trouble, Reese.
I've always thought so.
I was against taking you back
in, but I was overruled.
Wherever you go,
trouble finds you out.
I certainly would appreciate anything
you could do for me, Mr. Carter.
What's his name?
Walker.
What's his first name?
He never called himself
anything but that.
I've known him for years.
Not even his wife.
Wife have something to
do with his grudge?
Yeah.
Figures.
You know that mess you got us
into last year cost us $150,000.
That's what Walker's here for, isn't it?
The money you paid us back.
Only 93,000 belonged to him.
Only 93,000.
What's the story?
A job, Mr. Carter.
You remember the Alcatraz run?
The one I brought into
the organization.
Then Walker was one of
the men you held up?
No. He was with me.
You took his share,
too, is that it?
I needed all of it to pay you back.
You left with Walker's
share, and his wife.
- She still with you?
- He killed her.
You shouldn't have left him alive.
Does he know where you are?
- No, but he's looking.
- Fine.
Fine. I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll let him know where you are.
Then he'll come for you, won't he?
They're waiting.
It's a setup.
They're spreading the word now.
They want you to try and get him.
Where is he?
The Huntley. A place run
by the organization.
- Where would he be?
- All the way up. The penthouse.
He always uses it.
What's it like?
Fort Knox.
You've been there?
Once. To see Lynne.
What's that? An apartment house?
Yeah.
Residential.
That goes up to the top?
There's another elevator
inside the lobby...
- ...goes up to the other penthouse.
- They got two?
- What's the roof like?
- Flat. Open.
Look at it. Men everywhere.
You're gonna have a lot
of trouble getting in.
But you'll never get out.
- Well, he has to come out sometime.
- Yeah.
How bad does he want you, Chris?
- Oh, I don't know. Who knows?
- Yeah, you know. How bad?
Pretty bad, I guess.
Bad enough to let you
through into the Huntley?
Why should I?
Well, that's up to you.
- Mr. Reese, please.
- Right over there.
This way to heaven.
We have a saying in Brazil.
He says to go on up.
It says <i>Deus é brasileiro</i>,
which means, God is Brazilian.
So you see, we have no
worry in the world.
Of course you have to wear a gun.
- Why?
- That's a way of life.
Hello, Mal.
Go on in, honey.
Are these all right?
Yeah, that'll do fine.
Now tie yourselves up.
No, not individually, together.
Well, Cinderella.
I was beginning to think you'd
never come for your shoe.
Well, here I am.
What made you change your mind?
It's a woman's privilege.
All good things come
to those who wait.
Then I win first prize.
Scotch?
Scotch is fine.
Do you know how long I've
been hung up on you?
The first time I saw
you, with Lynne.
I've got some business to settle here
first, then we'll go to New York.
- You take empty bags.
- Sure, Mal.
Operator? Give me the police.
This is an emergency.
Now, wait till they answer.
Yes. Help me, please.
Yeah, I'm being attacked.
Ferguson, yes. 2291 Western.
Across from the Huntley.
Second floor.
Please, for God's sakes, hurry up.
- Is that all right?
- That was fine, thank you.
Have you seen Lynne lately?
You know about her and me.
You girls ought to
kiss and make up.
I haven't seen her.
Not since the two of you...
You ever meet Walker?
Oh, a couple of times.
Didn't he die or something?
About a year ago.
- What's going on?
- It's okay, Mal. It's across the way.
It's across the way.
- Hey, what goes?
- It's across the street.
It's all right. It's all right.
Well, what do we do?
Tell him.
Two guys. They were attacked.
- Hey, Mike?
- Yeah.
- A couple of clowns got held up.
- Is that all?
Huh.
Mal, could we close the curtains?
Sure.
It's a great view but...
Get up.
You okay, Mal?
Yeah.
- What are you gonna do?
- I want you to come with me.
- What for?
- I want my 93 grand.
- You don't stand a chance.
- Mal.
Mal. Mal. Wake up, Mal.
Come on. Wake up. Don't go
to sleep. Let's go. Come on.
On your feet. Let's go.
- Let me get dressed.
- I want you this way, Mal.
- My money, Mal.
- I've given it all to the organization.
- Who has it?
- There's no one man.
Go high enough, there's
always one man.
No, it's not like that.
It's a big operation...
- Names, Mal. Names.
- Fairfax.
- Brewster. Kill me. Carter.
- No.
- Come on, kill me.
- Who do you work for?
- Carter. Come on, Walker, kill me.
- Where do I find him?
It won't do you any good.
He's got protection.
- Where do I find him?
- I don't remember.
What do you mean,
you can't remember?
- I can't remember. The Stuart Building.
- Where?
He's got offices there.
It's called The Multiplex
Company, on the 12th floor.
- What's to keep me from getting in...?
- No one gets in without being searched.
Don't worry about me.
Worry about yourself.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get it
for you, but you've got to trust me.
Just trust me, Walker. Trust me.
You... You... You...
You're my friend, Walker.
You're my last chance.
We're going to Carter. We're
gonna do this one together.
Sure we will, Walker.
We'll live forever.
Walker.
- That's crazy.
- Reese.
- Stand back, folks.
- Come on.
What is it?
Come on, let's get out of here.
Stop it.
Don't shoot. Don't
kill me. Save me.
- Don't shoot. I quit.
- Who are you trying to kill?
- Who are you shooting?
- Oh, my leg. My knee. Stop.
Oh, my knee. Oh, stop.
Take it easy...
Oh, my knee.
My knee.
- I saw it, the ambulance and everything.
- Yeah, he fell.
You let him fall? You should've
killed him. You owed it to yourself.
This money belonged to your
sister. You better take it.
You died at Alcatraz, all right.
- Goodbye, Walker.
- Yeah, goodbye, Chris.
I'd like the number...
of the Multiplex Products Company,
please, that's in Los Angeles.
If you're looking for Carter,
I might be able to help you.
- Fred? Helen? Helen?
- Fred? Fred? Fred? Excellent.
Oh, did I interrupt you?
I'm so sorry.
Mr. Carter? I want
something from you too.
- What's that?
- My 93,000.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. It's my money.
- Fred? Coffee tomorrow?
- Yes, you bet.
So I don't have time
to turn around.
Luncheons, dinners.
I'm getting fat as a pig.
Reese owed us and paid us back.
- Any debt he has to you is his problem.
- It's your problem now.
Why don't you move over?
- You don't own the place, you know.
- I'm sorry.
Over here.
Don't monopolize him.
- Let me tell you about Reese.
- Reese is dead.
They're scraping his body up off the
sidewalk in front of the Huntley.
- Then his debt died with him, I'm afraid.
- Wrong. It passed on to you.
No business corporation would
acknowledge that debt.
If you don't, I'll kill you.
One jump ahead of these
foreign designers.
You must be stark staring mad.
- You do know who you're dealing with?
- Listen to me.
I want my money in 12 hours.
I'll tell you where to make the drop.
If you don't, you are dead.
I said nobody was to go up there.
He could have done without
a girl for one night.
- Mal told us to let her through.
- Oh, did he?
Is that what I'm to tell our friends?
This is gonna cost me to cover up.
The girl was Walker's
sister-in-law.
- We didn't know that.
- You didn't know that.
Well, he did. How the
hell did he know?
- She was the Trojan horse.
- What did you say?
I said, she was the Trojan horse.
Trojan horse.
You're a smart boy, Stegman.
Come on, I wanna talk to you.
- Get rid of them and bring the stuff.
- Right.
The door is this way.
- Do you know what I'm gonna do?
- Yeah.
Gonna have him...
- Wrong.
- Wrong?
Killing Walker is no longer
an economic proposition.
- What about the principle?
- Profit is the only principle. Come in.
What are you gonna do?
Nothing. You're gonna do it.
You're gonna pay Walker off.
Is this money?
Ever been so close to so much?
I made an agreement
with Walker last night.
The storm drain here.
An open storm drain.
Now, you go down and wait.
Walker will collect.
- But why...
- Why what?
Why me?
Because you know him.
You know what he looks like.
Oh, sure.
When do you want me to go?
Now, Stegman.
- Now, use that door.
- Oh, sure.
- Uh, Stegman?
- Yes?
You will give Walker
his money, won't you?
- Yes.
- You wouldn't try what Reese did?
Can I help you?
- Which door is he in?
- Behind me.
Okay, the buzzer.
- What are you doing? What do you want?
- I want my money.
I don't understand. It's all
arranged as you wanted.
You're crazy, Walker.
How can this help you?
Let's go.
Because I want you to
pay me personally.
You can't take me out of
here in broad daylight.
Things aren't done this way.
Let's be reasonable.
- It's a setup.
- I assure you, I always fix...
No.
- And you authorized the payoff, huh?
- Yup.
- You're the top man.
- Right.
- What about Brewster?
- What do you know...?
- Reese talked.
- The two of us ran things.
- Brewster and I.
- Nobody else?
- That's right.
- Nobody?
- A money man.
- What's his name?
- Makes no difference.
- His name?
Fairfax.
I'm a businessman.
A man of my word.
Stegman's with your
money, go get it.
You go get it for me.
No. No, it's all right.
It's all right, it's Carter.
Carter?
- With that little thing?
- It's high-velocity. He was a good shot.
Carter, Brewster, Fairfax.
- Brewster's next.
- Where do I find him?
- He's out of town.
- When will he back?
Tomorrow morning
he's got a meeting.
I want him alone.
We can fix that.
Where's the meeting?
At his house.
Where's his house?
We're here. This is it.
I said, alone.
Take it easy. You'll last longer.
Hello, Walker.
So they really got to you, huh?
I got well-paid for
fingering Reese.
This place is like a morgue.
I should have moved months ago.
This guy you were going
around with, did he...?
Spent some time here, huh?
Yes.
A lot of this stuff was his.
So, what are you gonna do now?
I don't know. What are you...?
What about you?
Are you asking me out?
Walker.
Well, come on in.
Whose is it?
Brewster's. It belongs to the
organization. They use it for meetings.
Nobody lives in it,
that's for sure.
Brewster, how do you
know he won't show up?
He will. That's why we're
here waiting for him.
So, what am I doing here?
I thought you'd be safer
with me than by yourself.
And when do we expect our host?
- Any time. Maybe not until morning.
- You'll ask him for the money.
- He'll say no and you'll kill him.
- Something like that.
What did you think
this was, a pitch?
Forget it.
You forget it.
<i>Good morning, Stevey.</i>
<i>It wasn't Lois' idea
or Mrs. Jenkins'.</i>
<i>It was yours.</i>
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>
<i>Get real flattered and be grateful
to you for the rest of my life?</i>
<i>You figure this will get me over
my neurotic inertia, or something?</i>
<i>Oh, get out of here.</i>
<i>You know what I...</i>
<i>The most fabulous
things happen to a girl...</i>
<i>when she tries Pond's
seven-da y beauty plan.</i>
<i>All I did was cream twice each night
for a week with Pond's Cold Cream.</i>
<i>You're a pathetic sight, Walker,
from where I'm standing.</i>
<i>Chasing shadows.</i>
<i>You're played out.</i>
<i>It's over. You're finished.</i>
<i>What would you do with
the money if you got it?</i>
<i>It wasn't yours in the first place.</i>
<i>Why don't you just
lie down and die.</i>
- Going to work?
- Another day, another dollar.
- Welcome back, boss.
- Bill.
- What do you want?
- My money.
- What for?
- For Stegman.
Stegman's nothing.
Who killed Carter?
Oh, Bill, Bill. The briefcase.
- I did.
- Oh, you did.
- What happened?
- Carter set it up.
He was where Walker
should have been.
- You don't care, do you?
- No, I love it.
Leaves you in a spot. You killed the
man who was supposed to pay you.
Who pays me?
I can't hear you.
- What about Walker?
- What?
Walker's still around.
This organization will
take care of Walker.
Never happen. He's a pro.
Walker's beautiful. He's
just tearing you apart.
- You coming with me?
- Pass.
I'll wait for Fairfax.
He'll pay me.
All right.
And, if he doesn't,
you can kill him too.
Hey.
What's my last name?
What's my first name?
Look at that hillside.
Nobody did any
watering or anything.
You tell people to do things here
and it doesn't make any difference.
Now, just a minute.
It's ice-cold, Bill.
Walker.
You're a very bad man,
very destructive.
Why do you run around doing
things like this? What do you want?
I want my money.
I want my 93 grand.
Ninety-three thousand dollars?
You threaten a financial
structure like this for $93,000?
Walker, I don't believe you.
What do you really want?
I really want my money.
I want my money.
Well, I'm not gonna give you any money.
Nobody else is. Don't you understand?
Carter!
- Well, who runs things?
- Carter and I run things.
- I run things.
- What about Fairfax?
- Will he pay me?
- Fairfax is a man who signs checks.
- No, cash.
- Cash, checks.
Fairfax isn't gonna give anything.
He's finished. He's dead.
- He just doesn't know it yet.
- Somebody's gotta pay.
- Make a phone call.
- Walker, it's a waste of time.
All right.
I'm just getting a cigar
out of here, that's all.
Cash.
You think I can go to
a hole in the wall...
take out $93,000 and
peel it off for you?
- Operator.
- Brewster, Los Angeles.
Get me Mr. Fairfax, will you?
Let me tell you about
corporations, Walker.
This is a corporation.
I'm an officer in it.
We deal in millions.
We never see cash.
I got about $11 in my pocket.
<i>- How are you?</i>
- Yeah, I just got in.
<i>How's the weather up there?</i>
Oh, it's all right. Dried
up the lawn a little bit.
Listen, I've got a man named Walker
with me, he says we owe him $93,000.
- Are you gonna say anything?
<i>- Well, what do you want me to say?</i>
He says he's going to shoot
me unless I give him $93,000.
<i>Look, Brewster, you know
me better than that.</i>
Wanna say a word?
How much is Brewster
worth to you, Fairfax?
<i>Threatening phone
calls don't impress me.</i>
Fairfax, he's getting
ready to fire the gun.
- Yes or no?
<i>- Of course not.</i>
Walker? What's happened?
Nothing, he... Where'd
you come from?
- I'm with him.
- Oh, you're...
Uh...
Walker, it occurred to me that...
That we might still be able
to do something for you.
I mean, get you the money you want.
But not here in Los Angeles.
There's still one setup where
large sums of money change hands.
It's up in San Francisco.
The Alcatraz run. Oh, you
remember it with Reese.
It's still there. Once
a week. Every week.
Alcatraz.
The drop has changed, but
the run is still the same.
So, well, if you wanna go
up to San Francisco, we...
Well, her too, if she wants.
I mean, anything you want.
You can trust me, Walker.
There's supposed to be a light
on that landing where you are.
I don't know exactly where
it is, but it's up there.
Is that it?
All right, good.
Just stay in the light.
- What do you mean?
- Well, nothing's gonna happen, is it?
No, nothing's gonna happen. Except
what I said was gonna happen.
We're gonna make the exchange and
you're gonna get your money.
The whole thing's just
a routine, Walker.
What are you looking for?
There's nobody else here.
Walker?
Walker?
Walker?
There it is.
Hey, Walker?
Walker?
Coming in.
Safe as a church. Your money.
What about your friend Fairfax?
Fairfax is dead.
- Or he will be tomorrow.
- It is tomorrow.
- Help me carry the box up?
- No.
Well, here's your money, Walker.
Walk...
Walker. Walker.
Why did you do that? Walker?
Walker didn't shoot you.
Fairfax?
This is Fairfax, Walker! Kill him!
You should've stayed an accountant.
Our deal's done, Walker.
Brewster was the last one.
He thought he could
take over from me.
Hey, Walker?
Come on in with me.
I've been looking years
for someone like you.
Well, come and get
your money, then!
Come on and get it!
I pay my debts!
Walker?
Walker?
Well?
Walker?!
This is the last time!
How do you like that?
I like it.
Leave it.
