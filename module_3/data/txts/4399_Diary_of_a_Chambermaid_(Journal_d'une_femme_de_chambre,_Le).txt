Could I have a bit of
quiet, please girls...
CÃ©lestine... come with me.
CÃ©lestine...
...I have an extremely
good position for you.
It will, though, mean moving to
the country... but not very far.
"To the country"?
You know I wouldn't be keen on that.
There are excellent positions
in the country.
That's a joke!
There's not a good position anywhere.
On the contrary, CÃ©lestine...
there's not a bad position.
I know...
There are only bad masters.
No...
only bad servants.
I give you the very best houses...
Why don't you stay?
You're intelligent...
You carry yourself well...
You're attractive...
You'd be happy, with the right behaviour.
Except it'll be bad behaviour.
Well, THAT's what I call behaviour.
"That" meaning what?
What do you imagine it means?
I don't imagine anything.
I don't think I'm going
to be able to rely on you.
It doesn't matter.
I promise MY behaviour will be right.
I can assure you I know
how to behave.
You can rely on me.
You're unstable...
You're not reliable.
If you say so.
Get yourself focussed...
and come back tomorrow...
The position will still be available.
- Are you the one from Paris?
- Yes, that's me.
Down!
Down!
Madame...
That's fine...
Thank you, Joseph.
You have lovely clothes,
young lady.
Thank you, ma'am.
-You'll change them right away,
won't you? -Yes, ma'am.
Tell me about your last position, please.
It was in Paris...
The home of a young couple.
There were 4 servants.
- Was the house large?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Who was responsible for the upkeep?
- The valet and myself.
Are you honest?
Certainly, ma'am.
Are you clumsy?
No, ma'am.
Why did you leave that house?
Your masters seemed happy
with your work.
It's just that I wasn't happy
in Paris any more.
Are you prone to mood-swings?
No, ma'am.
- Are you from Paris originally?
- No.
I'm Breton... from Audierne.
Follow me.
I'll show you around the house
and explain your tasks.
There are certain things
I need to stress.
I'm very attached to this frame, girl...
It's very valuable.
You will ensure it's dusted thoroughly,
especially in the grooves.
Without scratching it, of course.
As for this, girl...
it's very rare and very expensive.
You'll not see another like it.
You'll need to be careful with it.
Follow me.
This lamp comes from England.
It's very expensive, girl... and we'd
have to get it repaired over there.
Take care of it as if it were
your own special thing.
Follow me.
Would you send a cracked chamber-pot
to London?
Here it is.
Are you the new maid?
Yes sir... I am.
That's good... That's good.
So you're here?
That's very good.
That's very good.
- So you come from Paris?
- Yes, sir.
That's very good.
Very good.
What's your name?
CÃ©lestine, sir.
"CÃ©lestine."
That's very good.
That's very good.
Not a common name...
A pretty name, by jove!
As long as Madame doesn't
make you change it.
I do as Madame requires.
Yes, yes.
Well, CÃ©lestine...
...for I shall always
call you CÃ©lestine...
Perhaps you'll help me
remove my boots?
Certainly, sir.
Because, you see,
these damned boots...
...they're difficult...
they get stuck.
Good heavens!
You smell awfully good!
Me, sir?
Yeah, YOU, by God!...
- I hardly think it's my feet!
- No, sir.
- You smell awfully good!
- There you are, sir!
Are you living here now, CÃ©lestine?
I've been here 3 hours, sir.
Would you get me my slippers?
I must apologise.
Sir, this is my job.
They're under the stairs,
on the left.
I could lead this one a long way.
You're not eating?
I'm not hungry.
You'd eat truffles.
I HAVE eaten truffles, you know.
You've had good positions before.
Sure have.
Excellent positions.
Is this the first time
you've worked in the country?
No, I worked for a man in Touraine.
That was five years ago now.
And then, in Normandy, for a woman
from Paris and her little boy...
He was sick.
- You know the country then.
- No, nothing about around here.
That was on the coast.
The terrace lead onto a beach.
I had a lovely room there...
a master bedroom.
You don't miss Paris?
Yes, a lot.
But good positions
are hard to get in Paris.
Sir and Madame are good masters.
Does he go after maids?
What?
Does he have a thing
for maids?
It's not the sort of question
you should ask... Not correct.
And Madame?
What about Madame?
Does she have a lover?
It's clear you come from Paris...
...or God knows where.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Be so good as to follow me...
With your luggage.
- Anything to declare?
- No.
Open this trunk.
- There's nothing in it!
- Open it anyway.
Open it!
No, please.
Good heavens, but...
So what do we have here?
Jewellery.
Open it.
I told you...
It's jewellery.
Open...
...this box.
No. This is abuse of authority.
And I don't have the key.
If you don't open it, I'll have to fetch
the superintendent.
I will complain, do you hear?
Open it.
I can't. I can't open it.
Open it.
Keep these people away
and I'll open it.
Open this box.
Move aside!
Move aside!
I should declare that the box is yours.
That's very good of you, Madame...
...but I prefer the real-life type
of that jewellery.
You're a little fool!
- Where have you been?
- With Customs.
At The Priory,
they never hang on to a maid...
Either she sacks them
or he knocks them up.
Pretty ones, ugly ones,
young ones, old ones...
One bang and there's a kid.
A word of advice...
keep clear of Mr Lanlaire.
Beware of that man.
You've got time...
Come in for a moment.
Thank you... later perhaps.
"And a branch shall
grow out of his roots..."
This is the new vicar.
I recommend him.
There is nobody like him
for confessing women!
The spirit of wisdom and understanding...
"The spirit of counsel and might..."
"...the spirit of knowledge
and fear of the Lord."
"And He will not judge
by what His eyes see..."
"Nor make a decision
by what His ears hearÂ
"
"With righteousness
he shall judge the poor..."
"...and decide with equity
for the meek of the earth."
After, I'll take you
to Mrs Gouin, the milliner's...
A very kind and clever woman...
The saviour of these parts...
You saw her earlier.
She does abortions, you see.
"The leopard shall lie
down with the kid..."
"The calf and the young lion
will eat together..."
A lovely day today, Mr Joseph.
Yes.
Look them in the eyes.
In the eyes.
Fine.
CÃ©lestine, I want to see you!
In future,
would you please get back earlier.
She's starting to annoy me.
- What did you say?
- Nothing, ma'am.
A fine state of affairs...
Everything is behind this morning
because of you.
Now go and do my room.
You cow... you're getting me mad.
I'll talk with whoever I want...
I'll see who I choose to.
You'll not lay down the law to me.
Even her clothes.
The sex-starved idiot
thinks I'd steal her petticoats.
Did you see everyone at mass?
- I met Miss Rose.
- Ah, Miss Rose.
She can sure talk, that one!
She tells the whole country
what she'll inherit from her master.
A very bad man.
Though he used to be a captain.
Yes, that's what she told me.
He spends his time throwing stones
into our garden.
The master and he
get along very badly.
He spoils all of Mr Joseph's work...
...which sends Mr Joseph
into a frenzy of rage.
Did you start here
the same time as Mr Joseph?
No.
I started 3 years after him.
There was another cook before me.
- Do you know him well?
- For sure.
He's a great guy.
He looks after The Priory
as if it was his own.
The mistress says
he'd walk through fire for her.
He rejects all the
enticements he receives.
Joseph's a man you can trust.
CÃ©lestine!
CÃ©lestine!
Yes, Madame?
Bring me a needle.
Why are you walking around
with that?
I was washing it
when you called me, Madame.
And you do that slowly.
Damn! Damn! Damn!
Don't you listen?
Are you deaf?
Here's your needle, Madame.
Bring me some thread.
Good. Now bring me the scissors.
And hurry up!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
So why are you carrying on like that?
I don't like miserable looks.
You have a disagreeable manner.
Dis you find the scissors?
Now go and set the table.
I don't pay you to lounge about.
I hope you're getting
used to it here, CÃ©lestine.
Yes, I certainly am, Sir.
That's nice to hear.
That's not bad...
Not bad at all!
Did you have to fool around, in Paris?
Do you fool around?
- Sir.
- What?
A lovely girl like you...
you'd have to fool around!
So much the better...
I'm all for having fun.
I believe in love.
I'm not like your other housemaids...
I'm an honest girl.
I really should complain
to your wife.
No, no...
- Do you like pears?
- Yes sir.
Here... hide it in your pocket.
- Does anyone else give you pears?
- No, Sir.
I'll give you more sometimes...
Because I want you to be happy.
Please, Sir!...
- What if Madame were to see you?
- What "Madame"? What "Madame"?
I don't care.
I'm fed up with her.
You're wrong sir..
Your wife is a very nice woman.
God almighty!
She's a bitch... a total bitch...
My wife is a bitch!
You, you are so nice,
so good...
Come now, Sir!...
Come, come, Sir!
- If you'd like to...
- If I'd like to what?
You know very well what.
To deceive Madame with her husband?
To do dirty things with you?
- You don't imagine...
- I imagine everything!
One more word
and I'll tell Madame everything.
CÃ©lestine.
Have you finished your work
in the garden?
Yes.
- I've come for some hot water.
- I'll free some space.
No hurry.
- Isn't Madame home yet?
- No, not yet.
Have you seen what Mr Joseph
found in the garden?
Mr. Joseph isn't very talkative
with me.
It's just that he doesn't know you.
Don't take it personally.
Mr Joseph found an old slipper
in the garden.
The captain again. You should've seen
what Mr Joseph sent him.
CÃ©lestine, would you get me
some bread and cheese.
And some cider as well.
- You're eating here?
- I was a little peckish.
-And what are YOU doing here?
-I came to get hot water.
-There's laundry to be done and the
table's not ready. -Off with you!
Please go sleep with her
and get her off my back!
- Yes, Ma'am?
- Go pick up the dogs' meat, right away.
The dogs of the rich live well.
This is nice... Eh, darling?
I already told you
I don't want you using perfume.
Did you hear me?
Very well, Ma'am.
What you need is a good rogering.
To think that the cook has the lives
of her masters in her hands every day.
A pinch of arsenic instead of salt...
...a dollop of strychnine
instead of vinegar...
...and it's done.
But no...
...One has to resist the temptation.
If you like prunes... ask me.
I beg your pardon?
If you like prunes... ask me.
But I forbid you to take them.
I'm not a thief, ma'am.
I'm telling you
that you've taken some prunes.
If you believe me to be a thief, ma'am,
you've no choice but to dismiss me.
Mr Lanlaire ate 5 this morning.
There were 21.
Now there are only 14.
You've stolen two.
Don't let it happen again.
She counts the prunes!
Captain!
It's Miss CÃ©lestine...
...the Lanlaires' maid.
Mr and Mrs Lanlaire are in town.
- I wanted to grab the chance.
- Good idea!
Julien, go fetch the bottle of Noyau.
Is he still standing,
that Lanlaire of yours?
It's the worst house to end up in.
There was once a time
when we were friends with Mr. Lanlaire.
Then he criticised me for not maintaining
my rank with my maid.
If I took her to my bed,
what's that to him?
A man alone...
it's just natural.
He's a funny one!
That pig deserves it!
- He's young for his age.
- He sure is.
- Would you like to see the garden?
- I'd love to.
I'll get back to my work.
I can't walk too much
because of my asthma.
But don't be too long.
Besides, I'm watching you.
Yellow daylily... Hemerocallis.
Mexican aster... Cosmos bipinnatus.
Have you ever eaten it?
- What do you mean?
- Well, I've eaten it.
It's quite tasty.
I've eaten all the flowers here.
I eat everything, I do... everything!
- For a reason, Captain?
- Certainly.
Ane not just plants...
Animals, too.
Animals that nobody has eaten.
There are no insects or birds
that I haven't eaten.
Skunks, snakes,
rats, caterpillars...
I've eaten everything.
I was known for it.
Here Kleber...
Here Kleber...
Come here, Kleber.
Good Kleber!
Pretty little Kleber...
Have you ever seen a ferret as pet?
He eats with us.
I love him like a child.
But you wouldn't eat your ferret.
Kleber?
Make me a stew tonight!
Well, what are you waiting for?
- My mother...
- What about your mother?
She's dead.
Now... now I have nobody!
Oh... what a shame.
But we can't let it interfere
with your work.
Miss CÃ©lestine... come in.
Mrs Mendelssohn has a proposition
to put to you.
I've just been told
how very good you are...
I believe you deserve the praise.
You look intelligent, honest and cheerful.
I find her very pleasing.
I need someone trustworthy
for my grandson.
It only needs someone
to speak to me nicely...
...and not as though
I was some animal...
...for me to feel quite moved.
But don't stand there...
please be seated.
The position I'm offering
is not really a cheerful one.
That doesn't matter, Ma'am.
I'll do whatever you require of me.
You'll be comfortable here, Mr George.
Mr George.
Come along.
Lie down here.
You'll be able to go bathing,
being by the sea.
This will be handy,
as you'll see.
Come with me, child...
That's your room.
Lovely!
You like it, do you?
You're very kind, Ma'am.
Thank you.
I'm going up to my room.
It's on the 1st floor.
I'll come with you, Ma'am.
What's the matter, Ma'am?
You shouldn't let it get you down.
Mr. George is going to do very well here.
But the way he's coughing!
It all so upsets me, child.
Don't cry, Ma'am.
We'll pull him through.
I swear to you
that we'll pull him through.
Come on, Mr George.
Wait for me.
Come on, Mr George...
it's time for a dip.
That's great, Mr George!
That's great, Mr George...
I think you're better
than you were yesterday.
I'll get the port.
Is everything alright, my child?
Yes, Ma'am.
M. George had a nice swim today.
Now it's time for his port.
I realised that.
I realised it when I saw you.
George is getting some colour back,
thanks to you.
You must never leave us, my child.
Never ever!
Thanks.
CÃ©lestine, wait a minute.
But you should be resting,
Mr George.
That's the rule.
I can rest with you for a bit...
that won't hurt.
So come closer, my pet.
Would you read me some more
from "The Orientals".
I like that collection...
That's one of my favourites.
"I love on a bed of moss
"To sing a Spanish air
"While my sweet companions
"Feet grazing the ground
"Nomadic throng
"With generous smiles
"Dance and whirl
"Beneath an open parasol"
Your voice is soft.
"But mostly when a breeze
"Lightly touches my cheek
"I love to sit at night
"Sit and dream
"Gazing on the deep sea
"While the pale moon
"Opens across the water
"Its silver fan.
That piece's dead boring!
I thought it was nice.
What are you doing now, Mr George?
I'll draw.
CÃ©lestine, come over here.
I can't do it.
I don't feel so good.
My hand shakes...
I don't know what it is.
You too...
I can't really get you.
You can't keep still.
The weird light irritates me.
The sea here is horrible.
Everything's horrible today.
I don't want to see anything.
I only want to see you.
You're not being sensible,
Mr George.
If your grandmother saw you,
she'd be in tears.
Besides, why do you
call me "Mister George"?
I can't call you "Mister Gaston".
Call me "George".
Naughty girl!
I can't do that...
I never will.
Strange...
Does it means you'll always just be
a little slave.
Give me your hand.
You have such pretty hands.
You have such pretty eyes.
You really are pretty all over!
Please stay close to me!
It makes me feel so good
when you're close to me!
- Does that make you feel bad?
- Yes, Mr George, very bad.
What if your grandmother
were to come in?
No, she won't.
Come here.
You've nothing to fear.
Mr George...
See what happens...
Exciting yourself makes you sick.
You don't want to listen...
But it will all start again..
Please be sensible.
You're quite right.
I apologise.
I was crazy to imagine for a moment
that you could love me.
Why would you love me?
Loving you was making me better.
You're right not to love me.
You see me as sick.
You're fearful I might infect you.
That's understandable.
Don't talk like that, Mr George.
It's awful... wicked to say that.
And it hurts me very much.
It's horrible.
Horrible.
I've long awaited the kiss of yours
that will restore my life.
Stay there... you naughty boy!...
See how fearful I am?!
See... you naughty boy!
Well... I'll be going.
No...
I beg of you... stay, my child.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
So life returned to me...
with its ups and downs...
...with new faces...
...with liaisons that finished
as they started...
...swinging between opulent houses
and being out on the street.
- You watch out for that girl.
- Me? Well, here's an idea.
Cute, but where will get it?
A slut like that...
...a girl who may have
some dirty disease.
True... I still have it.
Don't I know what you get up to...
what you like?
All those muddy backsides
you go through in the country.
Honestly!
But there's an idea.
- But where will you get it?
- Little JÃ©zureau... 15 years old.
I had to pay 500 F.
We're waiting for you.
Otherwise you'd be in prison,
like your thief of father.
The filth of decadent people.
-Those republicans have to be
brought down. -For sure.
Jew vermin swarming everywhere.
Me, I'm a Frenchman.
- I stick up for my country.
- And how!
I never go out
without a heavy stick.
Everybody should do the same.
If I was in Paris
I'd burn down those Yids.
Well, I don't know...
...I've no reason
to be against the Jews.
I worked for them at one time.
It's simply that the Jews
are a dirty race.
Is it really any dirtier
than any other?
Jews and Catholics
are all the same.
They're all just as depraved.
The difference in religion
means nothing.
The Jews must be massacred...
disembowelled!
Let them die
with their guts hanging out!
It's the only solution.
He's quite a man, that Mr Joseph.
So you come from Caen,
Marianne?
Yes
I started as a maid
for a tobacco merchant.
Right away he was on to me.
A skinny guy...
...scraggy, fair-haired...
...blue eyes...
...with a pointy beard...
...that was short and silky.
So silky...
You fell for him!
I lost my virginity at 12
to a hairy old man...
...who stank to high heaven.
He had me after mass...
...in a hiding place under a cliff...
in exchange for an orange...
But I didn't want it.
So what was it like there, Marianne?
Well, I fell pregnant.
The tobacconist's wife kicked me out.
There I was, so young, out on the street
with a kid in my belly.
My boyfriend had nothing.
He found me this funny job
at the School of Medicine.
What sort of job?
My God...
I had to kill the rabbits
and little guinea pigs.
Nice, eh?!
So what did you do about the kid?
What could I have done about it?
Same as the little guinea pigs?
That's right.
See you tomorrow, CÃ©lestine.
Yes, tomorrow, Marianne.
There may be beggars
who'd be interested in that.
Try to obtain subscriptions.
Go all over...
...even where Republicans live.
If you score one,
that's where it'll be.
What's that about?
Distributing pamphlets against the Jews.
I have an arrangement
with those goodly priests.
But then, they're my ideas.
And they're well-rewarded.
I'm telling you this,
because I trust you.
It's just between us.
Understood?
Yes, of course.
It's good you came here tonight.
It's nice... I feel flattered.
You left right after dinner.
We didn't even have time
for a bit of a chat.
- Can I help you with your seeds?
- No.
It's no trouble.
I need to talk to you, CÃ©lestine.
Now, I feel I know you.
I really like you.
You have to admit
you've taken your time...
Why have you been
so disagreeable towards me?
You always pushed me aside.
You can never tell
about people at first...
Especially women.
It's the devil of a job
to understand a women.
Plus... you came from Paris.
Since you know me now,
tell me how I am.
You're like me.
- Me... like you?
- Yes.
I like you very much...
and I have money to boot.
You don't work 40 years
in good houses...
...without saving a bit.
Of course.
Do you have a lot of money?
A lot? No.
How much? Show me.
It's not here, CÃ©lestine.
Well, how much?
Maybe 15,000 fr... maybe more.
Gosh, you HAVE been clever.
That's Rose, coming home.
I'm from Cherbourg.
I know of a good opportunity
in Cherbourg.
A small cafÃ© near the port...
really great location.
Cherbourg's an unrefined sort of town.
People are cheerful, mischievous.
There's army and navy.
They get drunk for no reason.
They love sex.
They spend a lot on sex.
The only thing is...
...it would need a woman in it.
A woman who can manage...
...well-presented, and who's not afraid
of customers who misbehave.
Me?
Would that suit you, CÃ©lestine?
What about you?
Where do you fit into this business?
With you, dammit!
And we'd be married...
...in true friendship.
Would you expect me to make money
for you as a whore?
I dream of you, CÃ©lestine.
I dream of you in that little cafÃ©.
Here's Miss CÃ©lestine.
Is she obedient?
She knows how to behave, presents well.
And she sews.
Are you married?
No.
Are you, Ma'am?
Of course.
- Do you have children?
- Certainly.
Dogs?
Yes.
Are your maids required to stay up?
If I go out in the evening...
of course.
Do you go out frequently
in the evening?
I'm not interested in this position.
I don't work in houses like yours, Ma'am.
Good-for-nothing girls
who don't like to work.
Stuck-up bitch!
Child!
Child.
All of Paris parades through my house.
Famous generals...
...leading judges,
foreign ambassadors...
And if i were to tell you...
...that the French President himself...
Yes, my girl!
That will give you an idea
what my house is like.
If you would like...
Think how you'd succeed...
What do you say?
I've not had sufficient education
in love-making.
I'm quite sure you have!
What do you say?
My lingerie doesn't fit in
with your place.
If that's all it is...
...you've nothing to worry about.
Because at my place
it's all about...
...most of all...
...the beauty of nature.
A nice pair of stockings, nothing more.
Yes... I know what you mean.
So listen to me...
Sign up for a 3-month engagement...
...and I'll give you the best
and sexiest outfit there is.
Let me think about it.
That's alright...
Think about it.
I'll give you my address.
And when you feel it's right...
...just come.
So, goodbye for NOW.
CÃ©lestine!
Where IS that girl again?
It's cleaning-silver day...
had you forgotten?
Watch out, CÃ©lestine.
My Louis XVI cruet...
It's very rare.
You're unbelievable!
How could anyone be so clumsy?
- What did you say, Joseph?
- Nothing, Ma'am.
Where's Madeleine?
I didn't see her last Sunday.
Madeleine?
It's nothing, my dear.
It's nothing.
- You mean she's sick?
- Yes, she's sick.
But in 2 days it will have disappeared!
Mrs Gouin does abortions.
Did you see what they found
in the woods?
It was awful!
A dreadful crime.
Little Claire, who'd been brutally raped.
It must have been
some sort of monster.
Definitely.
The little girl was maybe a bit simple,
but she was so sweet!
She was only 11!
- The roadmender's daughter.
- Poor man...
Her stomach had been sliced open...
...with the intestines falling out.
And her privates...
her poor little privates...
...just a horrible swollen wound.
It happened 8 days ago...
That's what Mr Roux told me.
They can tell from the body.
It's nearly decomposed.
She used to spend all her time
in the woods.
She picked daffodils
and lilies-of-the-valley...
...and made bouquets.
She looked for morels,
that she sold at the market.
In summer it was mushrooms.
But at this time,
there's nothing to pick.
Her father didn't seem to worry...
Maybe it was him.
If it was him, why take her
into the woods?
- That's true.
- For sure.
It's all very suspicious.
I don't want to make
any assertions, but...
But what?
It wouldn't surprise me if it was...
Mr Lanlaire, if you want to know
what I think!
It's true he's a bad one.
He acts like a criminal.
He wouldn't be capable...
he's be too frightened.
"Incapable"?!
What about little JÃ©zureau?
The kid at Valentin?
Little DougÄre?
That's different.
We know that he's still having sex
with consenting minors.
But that he'd kill them?
That's scarcely credible.
Well, I'm saying that it IS!
Goodness me!...
We can never know the facts.
Mrs Gouin is right.
- I think it may be Fournier.
- Do you?
He'd enjoy it.
What about Boulet?
Well, I still say it's Mr Lanlaire.
Hello, Miss Rose...
How's the captain?
Hale and hearty, thank you.
You go home.
Did you know that little Claire was found,
raped and murdered in the woods?
Someone told me about it
this morning.
Does anyone know who did it?
Sure to have been some Yid.
What about my proposal?
Have you thought about it?
Here's the wood for this morning.
Thanks.
If you'd like me to mend your things,
I can do it...
I wouldn't mind.
What day was it you were in the woods
looking for some soil?
Do you remember?
No.
Why do you ask?
Just wondering.
I think it must have been Saturday.
The Saturday Claire's body was found.
Possibly... yes.
It WAS that Saturday.
That doesn't mean I was there
when she was killed.
They say that criminals return
to the scene of their crime.
Who says that?
I've read it in novels
and magazines.
You'd do better
to think of something else.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
What's up, Marianne?
Madame is getting worked up.
What is it, Marianne?
I'm frightened I may be pregnant.
I do think I'm pregnant.
Are you sure that's what it is?
Not positive.
I'm just frightened.
Who would've made you pregnant?
The master.
He's just the limit!
I haven't dared try stop him...
It's so hard here...
and he kept coming back.
He can seem nice and affectionate.
He's just a swine, isn't he, Marianne?
Yes.
But still handsome and everything.
- Are you satisfied, at least?
- Yes.
I'm quite satisfied.
That's to say...
I'd be satisfied if I was sure
I wasn't pregnant.
Don't worry about it.
How late are you?
One or two weeks,
I'm not quite sure.
It'll be alright.
Once, I was 2 months late.
I wasn't pregnant.
You don't have to be.
It doesn't matter.
Tomorrow I'll go see the milliner.
Listen to me carefully...
It would be awful
if his wife caught you.
There's no danger of that.
He only comes when she's out.
He doesn't stay...
As soon as he's satisfied, he leaves.
So what do you want I should do?
If she caught us...
She's kick you out.
That's right.
Yeah.
- Is he gentle with you?
- He's certainly gentle.
Does he say sweet things to you?
What does he say?
He comes in...
He throws himself on me...
then he pants...
He pants.
So cute.
Come on, Marianne...
You have to go down now.
Poor Rose...
The captain did the right thing.
What if we went anyway?
Not worth it...
She's be down on us.
<i>The air is pure,
the road is wide...</i>
<i>The bugle sounds the charge...</i>
<i>The Zouaves go singing...</i>
<i>And high on the hill...</i>
<i>The Prussians await them.</i>
<i>The bugler is an old warrior...</i>
<i>And when the fight is serious...
He's a tough companion</i>
How happy I am to see you!
A great pity, Captain.
- A great pity for you.
- Yes.
- Poor Rose.
- I cannot remain alone.
You won't replace her easily.
Everything can be replaced!
She knew you so well...
what you liked...
- She was devoted to you.
- Really?
I have to tell you...
I'd had enough of Rose.
She was useless around the house.
I couldn't even get a boiled egg
cooked to my liking.
I see.
Even if I had a chat with you,
she'd get jealous!
After all, I'm in my own home, dammit!
You're being unjust.
It's good that she died.
I'll tell you something...
If I'd died before her...
Rose would have been really caught out.
I was keeping something from her
she would've found very bitter...
...I can assure you.
I'd made a will in which
I gave her everything...
...house, money, annuities... everything.
She must have told you.
I was certainly aware of it.
Yes, but what she didn't know...
...was that I'd made a 2nd will...
...which cancelled the first one,
and where I gave her nothing.
Dammit!
Wasn't that something!?
So, what are you doing now, Captain?
Well now...
That depends on you.
On me?
Yes, on you.
In what way?
In a nutshell...
Would you take Rose's place?
And the wills, Captain?
I'll tear them up.
- I don't cook.
- I'll cook for myself.
Il y a cuisine et cuisine.
The things I want from you...
...I'm sure you're very good at.
You're a little swine!
Not little... a big one!
So then, CÃ©lestine?
35 fr a month...
...full board including the master's
bedroom... How does that sound?
We'll see a bit later... In the meantime,
find yourself another fuck.
He's believe anything, that dummy.
It'll need to be repainted
and done up like new...
...so it looks great.
With a new sign.
"The Military Post".
The thing is though...
...I can't quit here just yet.
- Why's that?
Because.
Not now.
So when would you quit for good?
Maybe not for 6 months.
Maybe sooner...
maybe later.
- It depends.
- On what?
- On some business.
- What business?
Some business.
With you gone, I couldn't stand it
here any more.
I've become too used to you now.
Would it mean anything to you
that we never saw each other again?
You can't make a woman do something.
Make her do what?
You always think badly about me.
- Why do you say that?
- Because it's true.
It's you who have something else in mind.
I haven't said no to anything.
I've just being thinking it through.
- You don't get engaged without thinking
about it. - We'll talk about it.
How long are you going for?
6 days.
I dream about you, CÃ©lestine.
Me too... I dream about you.
We have to get it together...
Now!
Joseph.
The Jew: Vermin of the world.
How they are overrunning France
The 12 Apostles of Dreyfus.
Come on.
Oui...
Oui...
When I give the alarm...
...you come down with the mistress.
You'll say nothing.
You won't speak.
Not one word.
When everything seems alright, I'll go.
Every night at 11...
...you'll be watching at the window.
And if you see a light shining,
the next day, you'll resign.
And you'll come and meet me at 11pm...
...at the entrance to the little wood.
Ma'am!
Ma'am!
Ma'am!
Ma'am, there's been a robbery!
Ma'am!
Sir!
What's wrong?
You've been robbed, ma'am.
- What's been taken?
- Everything!
- Everything, Ma'am.
- Dear God!
- What's been stolen?
- Wait.
Oh, my God!
Bloody hell!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
My silver!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
My silver!
Come now, darling, calm down.
They've taken it all!
All! All! All!
- Even the Louis XVI cruet!
- Oh, bloody hell!
What about the dogs!
What use are they
if they don't bark when they have to?
Come now, darling, calm down.
What are you doing here?
Standing there stupidly
with your thick puffy face?
You don't suspect any of your staff?
Your coachman?
Joseph? A man who's been devoted to us...
He's been with us 15 years.
He is a pillar of honesty.
A pearl.
He'd go through fire for us.
Days, months passed.
The investigators were unable
to discover anything.
They abandoned the case indefinitely.
They said it must have been done
by a gang from Paris.
Paris is easy to blame.
- I'm just too tired, ma'am.
- But it can't be possible.
But it is possible.
I need to rest.
You talk to him.
Look now, Joseph...
You will leave with our best wishes,
Joseph.
Thank you Ma'am.
Thank you, sir.
I told myself that I'd
become a pearl, too.
I did and said everything
to win her favour.
She began to soften up.
Bit by bit she actually became my friend.
He's a nice boy who's been
waiting for me for a long time.
Can't you just stay a little longer?
He's waiting for me, ma'am.
I must return to Brittany.
I'll raise your wages...
...and you'll have a room
on the 1st floor.
I have no choice, ma'am.
I've become so used to you.
It's just my bad luck.
Off we go.
Joseph is holding on to me...
He takes me like a man possessed.
And I'm happy with him.
I'll do anything he wants me to...
...even commit crime.
