It's a real nice sign. How much?
I have to see ID.
I left it at home. How much?
I'm not
gonna sell you this unless you show me ID.
Stop being a shit.
Keep the fucking change, man.
I'm not keeping the change.
I have to see ID.
I don't have any fucking ID.
I've been coming in here for three months.
Frank never cards me.
Yeah, Frank lost his job
because he did not get the proper ID
when he sold people beer.
Why are you being such an asshole?
Just take the money,
put it in your register
and let me get the fuck out of here.
Listen, it's the law
of the state and it's the policy...
I don't give a fuck about you
and I don't give a fuck about your laws,
you understand what I'm saying?
Take the goddamn money, all right?
Let go of the beer.
- Don't be an asshole.
- Let go of the beer.
- Dick.
- Shithead.
Dick.
Don't mention it.
I saw you this morning.
Yeah?
Got any dope?
No.
Get in. I know where to get some.
Where are we going?
Feck's.
Out of love
Out of mind
Radical.
Out of food
Out of time
Those who live do not care
He did something bad to her! I know it!
We'll find her.
Where is that brother of yours?
Where is my Missy?
I killed her.
No!
I drowned her.
A man's trying to sleep!
Kim, please.
You little punk!
I said I'm trying to sleep up here!
Okay, Kim, Kim.
We'll make him buy you a new one.
It wouldn't be the same.
I want my Missy back!
Why are you so mean?
Where do you think you're going?
Somebody is trying to sleep!
Stick your head up your ass
if you want quiet!
Tim, you get back here!
Tim!
- Lighten up.
- Tim.
Remember my age.
Stupid enough you pull a stunt like that,
but then to go and brag about it!
Open this door!
Harlots of hell
Spread your wings
As I penetrate your soul
Hurry your ass!
Be right there!
He's here early.
Drug run, right?
None of your business.
Matt!
What about your other doll?
What about Baby Tracy?
No.
I'll make the turdface buy you a new one.
I don't want the turdface
to buy me a new one.
I want you to beat him up.
Oh, honey. Tim.
Tim!
Matt!
Going to Feck's?
What do you know about Feck?
Beat it, fart.
Let me go with you guys.
I could show you a dead body.
What? You got a girlfriend now?
I'm not kidding!
Look, I'm dying for a joint.
You get back in this house
right this instant!
Tim! Tim!
What's this? Feck doesn't charge.
I charge. What, you think this
car runs on God's own methane?
I don't know.
Where were you last night anyhow?
John was getting all out of control.
I'll bet.
Who else was there?
Jamie.
Jamie. I didn't miss anything.
Now, Clarissa, maybe.
Keep your hands off Clarissa, dude.
Shit, what am I worried about?
Feck!
What? Are you dying in there?
Feck!
Feck!
Feck!
- Check's in the mail.
- Okay. Okay.
It's me, Feck. Layne.
Don't shoot, okay?
I could blow your brains out.
- I know, Feck.
- I shot a girl once.
I know. You keep telling me that, Feck.
You want to lower that barrel some?
I am your friend.
Yeah, you say so, huh?
- You're my friend?
- Yeah.
That may be so.
Don't you try anything.
Okay.
Won't you and Matt come in and see Ellie?
I'd love to, Feck, you know,
but we're kind of... We're late for school.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
Well?
How much you want, then?
Come on, no, dude!
I came by to see how you're doing.
Good old Feck, you know.
Yeah, yeah, good old Feck. Yeah.
How much you want?
Just a couple joints.
Wait here.
You're my friend.
Of course.
She had it coming, man.
I know. I know, Feck, you know.
Women are evil. You had to kill her.
They're still after me, you know?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right. See you.
All right. I'll see you.
Well, thanks for the weed.
Friends. Yeah.
You're my friend.
Ellie? The gun. Did he have the gun?
- Right.
- Yeah.
You're my friend.
Give me a cigarette, man.
You fucking gave up cigarettes.
I gave up yesterday, not today.
I gave up lending.
Learn some self control here.
You're interrupting. Go on.
I don't know. I just figured we
could dump this place, you know?
Go up there and if we like it,
we stay, don't come back.
Where'd you get Portland?
Well, nobody knows us up there.
People know us here?
I know you, babe.
That's really annoying, Layne.
So what, Matt? We'd be like...
We'd be lumberjacks or something?
There's other things to do.
Like what?
Like get stoned.
It almost sounds like a plan,
except we're all broke
and I'm the only one with a car.
We could just take all our parents' money,
take off,
discover America
and make like we're Easy Rider, plus five.
Shit. I gotta go.
Burkewaite is gonna have a spaz attack
if I'm late again.
She's in love with his middle-aged ass.
He's not middle-aged, asshole. Hi, John.
Didn't think you'd make it today.
Where's Jamie?
I killed her.
She's gonna be in big trouble
if she keeps ditching like this.
You what?
I killed her.
You're strange, John.
What'd you do, man? Sit on her?
They don't believe me.
Crazy fucking story like that,
why should anyone believe you?
If you brought us all the
way out here for nothing...
Come on.
It's a joke. What BS.
You crazy motherfucker, John.
Do you see this?
Yeah, I see it.
You crazy motherfucker.
Why did you kill her?
She was talking shit.
You could fry for this, you know.
Yeah.
This is unreal, completely unreal.
Matt!
What's with you?
Better go, huh?
John!
It's like some fucking movie, you know?
Friends since second grade.
Fucking like this.
And then one of us gets
himself in potentially big trouble.
Now we've got to deal with it.
We've got to test our loyalty
against all odds.
It's kind of exciting.
I feel like
Chuck Norris, you know?
So, what was accomplished?
I mean, that's a normal question.
All the hippies are executives now
and everybody sold out.
Well, let me tell you something, Tom.
Save it, Kevin.
Fundamental changes were made.
Changes so basic that we
now take them for granted.
The civil rights movement.
Later, the women's movement.
I mean, like it or not, ladies,
you're now expected to have careers,
then maybe later,
the husbands and the babies.
In Vietnam
we stopped a war, man.
We took to the streets
and we made a difference.
We turned public sentiment around
and we made people see the truth.
Not that we were always
thinking good thoughts back then.
I mean, cops around you cracking skulls,
you've got a picket sign in your hand,
you're not thinking specifically
about stopping the war right now.
You're thinking about
knocking a few pigs on their asses.
But as crazy as it all seemed, though,
there was a meaning in the madness.
A clear and a real purpose.
But don't you think violence is wrong?
Fuck off, Kevin.
Wasting pigs is radical, man.
You miss my point.
Come on, Clarissa. Let's go grab a smoke.
You go on. I'll be there in a minute.
You are hooked.
Yes.
Bullshit.
Would I lie?
You really...
Really what?
No way.
Look, dude, I saw it
right there in front of me.
I poked at it with a stick.
No chance.
Poked at what?
By the river?
Tony, we'll take you there
and we'll show you.
- Right, Matt?
- Count me out, okay?
Count you out of what? What's by the river
and what are you guys talking about?
Layne's saying Samson killed Jamie.
No way.
And you believe them?
Well, a bunch of us
are going out there to check it out.
I don't know. It's probably some joke.
Yeah, yeah.
They're just trying to lure you up there
so they can rape you, Mag.
You think so?
Never been up on the hill
Let's go, let's go, let's go
No free food, Layne.
Come on, Mike. I just came by to say hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Oh, no.
There's a house far away across town
People coming from miles around
You can't use my truck, Layne.
Come on, Mike. It's important.
Just wanna see about this miss
That's it
Baby, let's git
And go away
Up on the hill
What's all this?
We're the newly-appointed truant patrol.
You know, looking to capture and kill
10-year-old runaway homeboys like you.
Maybe you're all gonna go see a dead girl.
What do you know about a dead girl?
Me and John are close, huh, John?
Yeah.
I was thinking of coming with you guys.
No room. Both you guys, out of here.
John wants us to stay. Don't you, John?
Nice try, Layne. Nice try, but forget it.
I'm not gonna let you do this to me again.
I made myself a promise.
No. N-O spells nuh-uh.
Mike.
No. No one drives that truck but me.
Well, then you drive it, then.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That's very nice.
My supervisor is gonna kill me
if he even sees me talking to you.
Now you want me to just walk out,
leave work and lose my job.
Yeah
Everybody's gonna be there
My people and yours from everywhere
Ain't got all day, you know.
I know, Mike.
Some of us have to work, Layne.
Is that it over there?
It's just a log, Mag.
What? That?
It's a dummy. This is a joke.
We all came out here for some stupid joke.
My God.
Oh, my God.
You're in trouble, dude.
No, man. Nobody has to find out.
Okay, listen up.
We've got a lot of people here.
Bury her so she's never found.
Is anybody gonna help me?
Where you going, Mike? Get back here!
I gotta get back to work, Layne.
I said get back here, God damn it!
Layne, leave me alone! Let me go!
Let me go!
We're dealing
with our friends' futures here, Mike!
- He killed somebody!
- You're gonna bring her back?
It's done. Now give me the keys.
He brings us out here like
it's some kind of a fucking show!
We're here to deal with it.
Now give me your keys.
No, damn it!
- You son of a bitch!
- Layne!
Leave him alone, Layne.
What the fuck are you doing?
He doesn't have to stay
if he doesn't want to.
So, me and John are
gonna have to do this all by ourselves?
What the fuck are you doing?
She's heavy. Come on.
Are you coming?
You people are a fucking test! I swear.
You nailed it!
Sure you don't want to come?
Yeah. I'm tired.
Hey, you, stub dick. Come here.
Suck me.
I'm serious, Tim.
You keep your little
fucking mouth shut, you hear?
- About what?
- You know.
Tony told me you know.
The death.
Don't worry. I'm with you.
I'll trust you.
Why are you two such delinquents?
Because of our fucked-up childhoods.
What are you doing?
Taking my gun.
You gave it to me two months ago.
I gave it to you two months ago.
You pothead fuckbrain!
I have to work tonight, honey.
Miss work.
Didn't I tell you not to smoke in the house?
Jim is sensitive to smoke.
Jim, Jim, Jim.
He pays rent, Matt.
He has a right to his comfort. Where's Tim?
Outside being worthless.
Why do you let him hang
around with that hoodlum?
Why do I let him? What am I gonna do?
Why do I let you smoke dope in the house?
Where did you get that, anyway?
Don't worry. It's not yours.
Will you come to Missy's funeral?
I'll come.
You're losing your touch, Layne.
It's the circuits inside.
People who own this place
have them all reconnected
'cause they know that
if I ever learn this machine,
I'll take control of the fucking universe.
So, what's gonna happen?
I'm gonna put another quarter
in this machine and murder it.
No, no, with John and all that.
Nothing's gonna happen.
I'm gonna tie up a few loose ends tonight
and nothing's gonna happen.
That's it?
He murders Jamie and we just ignore it?
He had his reasons.
She was shooting her mouth off
about his mom.
His mother's dead.
Yeah. See?
He's got a couple loose springs when it
comes to dealing with his dead mother.
But he comes to school bragging.
It's like he wants to get caught.
Well, he's not gonna get caught
because no one's gonna tell.
Isn't that right, Tony?
- Man, I wouldn't narc.
- But don't you think...
I think we should just quit talking about it
because some potential fink
could be listening.
That's what I think. Right, Tony?
Sure thing, man.
Okay.
Clarissa, wouldn't want John hearing you
shoot your mouth off about him, right?
Bullshit. Layne's just full of bullshit.
There's a phone right there.
He thinks he controls all of us.
Thinks because he says something,
we have to do it.
- We usually do.
- Well, this just isn't right.
I don't care if it was John or who it was.
Well, there's a phone, Clarissa.
What makes John
more important than Jamie?
Wasn't Jamie our friend, too?
I mean, I've known her since kindergarten.
Here's a quarter and there's the phone.
He's dangerous.
It could've been you or me dead now.
He probably raped her, too.
Here.
Who do I call, anyway?
The police, I guess.
Well, I'm supposed to know the number?
- Well, call the operator.
- You do it.
I don't know what to say.
Here, I'll dial and you talk.
Damn him anyway.
Everybody that's been exposed
to the effects stays right here.
And that goes for you, too.
Me? What do you mean?
You're quarantined.
Why, that's ridiculous! I won't stand for it!
Matt.
I can't get the damn thing
to stand up straight.
Don't cuss.
Shit, that's Layne.
Tell him I'm not here, okay?
Okay.
He's not here.
Yeah? Where'd he go?
To buy an egg. Bye.
Hold on there, little lady.
I said he's not here.
I believe you, kid. Can I use your phone?
- No.
- Your mommy and daddy home?
Mommy's at work.
Jim's at a bar. I don't have a daddy.
Thank you, Samson.
Will you read to me later?
What tonight?
Cat in the Hat.
No, no, Green Eggs and Ham.
Sure thing, Aunto.
Yeah?
Fixing Aunto's dinner.
Yeah.
No.
No, no. I have to read to her later.
Jesus, Layne, don't worry about it.
It ain't that important.
Ain't important?
They're gonna nail you, dude.
I've known you for too fucking long
to let something like that happen to you.
Fuck you, then! I'll do it myself.
And I'll be expecting a sixer for this. Shit.
What I do for my fucking friends!
Good work.
Shit.
Hello?
Just a sec.
It's Clarissa.
Want me to tell her you're buying an egg?
No.
Is it your girlfriend?
Get out.
Hello. Clarissa?
That's me. Just called to see what's up.
Nothing much.
I was just helping my sister with a...
With what?
Nothing.
I didn't see you at the arcade today.
Figured you had something going on.
Yeah.
You probably want to get back
to whatever it is you're doing.
No, I can talk.
No. No, you're busy.
I was just sitting around,
figured I'd call you.
You know how it is.
Nothing important.
I'll see you tomorrow, Matt.
Yeah. I'll see you, Clarissa.
I'll be there in a second, okay?
You go in now, all right?
You think I'd at least rate a Michelob.
Don't be an ingrate.
You're calling me an ingrate?
I never asked you to do it, Layne.
A friend doesn't have to ask a friend
do something like that.
It's warm, even!
You don't even care, do you?
I ain't drinking it.
About yourself, you dumb fuck.
How do you expect other people
to care about you?
It's people like you that are
sending this country down the tubes.
No sense of pride. No sense of loyalty.
No sense of nothing, man!
Why do you think there's so many
fucking welfare cases in this country?
Why do you think it is that Russia's
gearing up to kick our asses, man?
Drink your beer, Layne.
No, I won't drink my fucking beer!
I'm talking here!
These things are important to me.
And believe it or not,
you're important to me.
Look at that.
Son of a bitch. Duck down.
Hope they don't upset Aunto.
Duck down, God damn you!
You wanna get caught?
Somebody fucking narced!
- Yeah.
- Okay. Now, we can't panic.
I'll bet you it was Mike.
I'll bet you anything it was Mike!
Okay, we're just gonna
drive around here a little while,
we're gonna see if we can't
figure this thing out.
We're gonna have to
get you out of town somehow.
You have any money? We'll need money.
We're gonna have to put you up
somewhere until we can get money.
We can't panic though.
We're dead if we panic, okay?
Whatever you say, Layne.
Okay.
You're sure this is the right place?
I can't understand it.
Thought you said she was buried.
No. She was just
lying down here in the grass.
If this is some joke that
you're playing with your friends...
Captain Bennett, over here!
Did the sight of this dead girl
move you in any particular way?
I don't know.
Were you shocked? Angered? Saddened?
Did the sight please you?
I don't know how I felt.
- You knew this girl.
- Yeah.
How did you feel about her?
I don't know.
I'm getting sick of "I don't know."
Do you hear me?
Did you love her? Did you hate her?
Did you fuck her when you got bored?
She was a friend, I guess.
What do you mean you guess?
Either she was or she wasn't.
She was.
So, you're standing there,
staring at your dead friend
like it's all some kind of a big joke, right?
Some adventure!
What the hell was going
on in your head, man?
Exactly what?
What were you thinking about?
Or were you even thinking at the time?
Answer me, God damn it!
I don't know, okay?
You want me to make something up?
No.
I want you to tell me the truth.
The body, Matt.
How do you figure it got in the river?
I don't know.
Well, take a stab, huh?
What do you think? You think maybe it
rolled or a big gust of wind
peeled off the river and scooped it right up?
Maybe.
Or maybe somebody pushed it.
- Maybe.
- Maybe you pushed it.
I didn't push it.
You're the only one we're sure was there.
I told you about John.
John?
Samson. We call him John
because of his last name, Tollet.
You know, Tollet, toilet, John.
That's very clever.
So, you... You helped Samson, John,
push the body off.
- Right. After I helped him kill her.
- Yeah?
Yeah, fuck you, too! I reported the thing!
Man, you act like I'm guilty of some crime!
What do you think,
you're going somewhere?
I've got my rights.
You can't keep me here forever.
I didn't do anything!
That was exactly your mistake, buddy.
You saw this body and
you didn't act immediately.
That makes you an accessory after the fact.
I could arrest you right now if I wanted to,
so why don't you sit down?
We'll talk some more.
I find you very interesting.
Feck!
Feck!
Feck!
Check's in the mail.
No time for bullshit, Feck. Open up.
Yeah. And put that thing away.
Last thing we need's cops.
Hurry your ass! You've met John.
I killed men bigger than you!
He knows, Feck, he knows.
Look, Feck, John's in trouble.
He needs your help.
Trouble? What did you do?
Nothing, Feck.
I killed Jamie.
Damn it, John!
He didn't exactly kill her.
It was an accident.
Well, I killed a girl once. It was no accident.
Put the gun right to the back of her head,
blew her brains right out the front.
I was in love.
I strangled mine.
Did you love her?
She was okay.
Okay, okay, Feck,
we've gotta get John out of state.
Need your car.
You're not using my car.
You've got a car of your own.
Mine won't make it that far.
No. I might need mine.
Feck, you haven't been
out of this house in over five years.
What if somebody sees it, then?
They're still after me.
You know that.
They've been after me for 20 years.
I mean, you kill a person,
they don't let you forget.
They stick after you like ghosts.
I mean, they don't believe you
when you say you're sorry.
They want you to pay somehow.
Okay, okay, okay. Feck, forget the car.
How about if John just stays here
while I go figure this thing out?
Sure.
Okay. I'll be back.
John, I don't want you showing
your face outside this house.
Company.
Yeah. I love company.
What are you staring at?
You pull me away from work.
You're involved in this murder.
I didn't kill anybody, damn it!
John did it. John wasted Jamie.
You don't seem too concerned about it.
What the hell do you know?
You don't know anything.
Tim hasn't come home tonight.
He's only 12 years old, Matt.
It's past midnight!
Where do my children go at night?
Put the car into gear, Mom. He's okay.
Hey, I saw your friend on TV tonight.
I thought maybe I might catch you, too.
- Fuck off.
- Don't you two start.
What? His best friend killed a girl.
That's big news.
And he dumped the body and he bragged
about it all around school.
I'll bet you even know
where he's hiding, don't you?
They haven't caught him?
Don't give me that phony surprise shit,
'cause I know something's up.
Your fucking punk friend's
been calling here all night, huh?
What, he help you kill the poor girl?
Jim!
Maybe he did.
Maybe I am a killer. Why should you care?
You just stay around here
to fuck my mother and eat her food.
- Matt!
- He moves!
You're a real fucking asshole.
- Try something. Go ahead.
- Jim, Jim.
Motherfucker! Food eater!
- Want me to shove that up your ass?
- Come on! Come on!
- Shove it up your ass!
- Come on! Hit me! Go ahead.
Hit me! Hit me!
Come on, come on.
- Tough guy?
- Yeah.
Come on! Show me how tough!
- You're not even worth it.
- Come on! Shit!
Great.
He's still killing her.
Come here!
Come here!
Why do you pull shit like that? Why?
Leave me alone.
Answer me! Answer me!
I didn't do anything.
Fuck you!
Answer me why! Why?
Get off of him! Come on!
You dirty traitor!
What do you mean by that?
You know what I mean.
I saw you on that phone tonight.
You keep your little mouth shut.
You're gonna pay for what you did.
You're gonna die for what you did!
You little shit!
You're a dead man, Matt!
Timmy! Timmy!
Where you going? Come on...
You let them both get away?
Madeleine, I got troubles of my own, man.
I don't wanna
fight your delinquent sons, okay?
You don't even care, do you?
Look, you're the mother here.
I didn't give birth to the monsters.
My fucking brother.
Go get your nunchucks and your dad's car.
I know where we can get a gun.
Matt!
Where the hell have you been?
I've been looking for you all night.
We should've never let Mike in on it.
It could've been anybody, Layne.
Bullshit. I happen to know my friends,
fucking know them.
I know who's cool and who's not.
Maybe John finked on himself.
And maybe you finked on him.
Be realistic. This is us we're talking about.
We're a fucking team.
We're like Starsky and Hutch.
None of us is gonna fuck it up on purpose.
Where's John now?
Safely hidden away
where he can't get in any trouble.
No finer weed have you ever tasted.
My sister,
she drives this down from Humboldt
along with the regular Feckweed.
She comes to visit about once a year.
Yeah.
She's real fat.
You ought to see her.
She's like a goddamn hippopotamus.
John?
Where are you?
John?
Shit.
Who's that?
Who's there?
It's the mad rapist.
Layne?
John?
Look, this isn't funny.
I'm getting scared here.
I'm about to scream.
Have a heart attack.
What the hell are you doing here?
Just came by to say hi.
Some way of saying it.
Hope we didn't wake you up.
Get dressed.
Come out here. Bring all your money.
- Wait, what?
- Just do it!
Clarissa, is that you?
Yes.
Let's have it.
Quarters?
What do you expect,
waking me up in the middle of the night
and not telling me what's going on?
What's going on?
$2 and money for gas.
One of us should get a job or something.
Are you coming or what?
We gotta get Tony.
You're letting yourself
get jerked around, baby girl.
It's Tony's dad.
Tony.
Tony.
Shit!
Should've stayed in bed.
What a crazy fucking guy.
Tony's always broke anyhow.
Clarissa!
Bitchin'!
Go up here.
That's Feck's.
Park over there.
John.
There you are.
I was getting worried.
Look what I found. We could get it stoned.
Got that special dope you promised?
Yeah, yeah. Sit down.
You know, Layne said that you weren't
supposed to leave till he come back.
Layne can be a little annoying sometimes.
He means well. Look.
Don't do that, man!
What's the matter? Is she allergic to cats?
Cats have claws.
Come on.
Go get that cat and get it out of here, man.
No.
Let it explore.
You're really attached
to this thing, aren't you?
I saw you two dancing.
Feck.
Are you, you know,
are you a psycho or something?
No, I'm normal.
She's a doll. I know that.
Right, Ellie?
But you, you killed a girl, right?
Are you a psycho?
Yeah, probably.
What other excuse do I have?
You were a biker.
Yeah, years ago.
Man.
I ate so much pussy in those days,
my beard looked like a glazed doughnut.
Is that when you lost your leg?
Motorcycle accident.
Whole gang ditched me
and kept on riding.
My leg was right out
in the middle of the street.
I remember lying in the gutter,
all bleeding and shaking,
staring at my leg right next to a beer can.
And I remember thinking, "That's my leg."
"I wonder if there's any beer in that can."
I also remember thinking,
"Maybe they can sew that leg back on."
And then there comes the ambulance
and runs right over all of it.
Wasted that leg.
What'd I need it for?
I got another one, right?
I figure once you start fighting,
you're always defending yourself.
For me, I get in a fight,
I go fucking crazy, you know?
Everything goes black and then
I fucking explode, you know?
Like it's the end of the world
and who cares if this guy wastes me?
'Cause I'm gonna waste him first.
I mean, the whole world's
gonna blow up anyway.
Might as well keep my pride.
I got this philosophy.
You do shit
and it's done.
And then you die.
You got any more beer?
Shit! What time is it? Is it 2:00 yet?
It's creeping up.
All right, fuck, man. Time for a beer run.
Does that car of yours work?
You're not supposed to go anywhere.
- Layne said...
- Layne, Layne, Layne. You go.
I'll stay here. I'll be a good boy.
Come on, Feck.
There are people out there
who would like to see me dead,
and I've told you that.
So who buys your groceries for you? Ellie?
That!
Did you hear that?
Get paranoid, why don't you?
No, no, out front.
You didn't have to call me a stupid bitch.
You would have driven right past us.
We had to yell something.
You yelled at me.
I've got a name, you know.
You're lucky I didn't just drive right home.
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry, Clarissa.
But you've got
to understand that, in a time like this,
where every fucking second counts,
a man can't waste his time
choosing words.
What is this, Mission: Impossible?
You could have done this all by yourself.
I don't even see why you need us here.
Okay, it's not like I need you here,
like, physically need you here.
I mean, I can drive.
I can collect money, but we're a gang
and I need you here, you know?
Would you shut up?
Would you shut up back there?
I feel real twisted right now.
Twisted like I should just go to the
cops and tell them where John is.
I wouldn't even joke about that, Clarissa.
What would you do, kill me?
You'd love that, I bet.
You and John
could run off and be outlaws together.
But first, to show off to your friends,
strap my dead body to the top of this car
and drive all over town.
Get out!
What?
You don't understand
a goddamn thing, do you?
Jamie is dead, damn it!
And there's nothing
that we can do to save her.
Now I happened to like Jamie,
but John is still alive.
Don't you see that?
And who's next on his list?
You're just gonna leave me here?
What if John's around?
Ask him to forgive you.
Here. Here's your money.
We don't need this shit.
We can't just leave her alone like this.
Okay.
Fuck!
You stay here and you protect her.
I should have known that I was the only
one that could handle a crisis.
Do you want your money back, too?
Keep my money, Layne.
What's with you?
I don't know. I figured I'd walk you home.
I can make it on my own.
Well, come if you're gonna come.
You want my coat or something?
You look kind of cold.
No, I'm okay.
You agree with him, don't you?
Layne? Not really.
You probably do.
Everybody goes along with him, like he's
got some special power or something.
I think he's totally wrong.
Layne brags about me, doesn't he?
What do you mean?
About getting me.
I know he does,
so don't even say he doesn't.
Does he?
Not to me.
You look kind of cute when you lie,
you know that?
What?
You should see him, though,
when there are no other guys around,
and he's alone with me
and he thinks he might get lucky.
Shakes like a leaf.
Always has to be drunk, too.
He's like
Layne: Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic.
They could make a movie out of him.
Do you have to be drunk
before you can kiss a girl?
Wait here.
Clarissa, is that you?
Yes.
I'm too hyped up to sleep.
Let's go to the park and
look at the stars or something.
We'll pick up a sixer on the way.
Shit.
Come on, God damn it!
I know you're in there!
Those assholes!
Good evening.
Sorry, the bar is closed.
Why?
It's 2:05, man.
- Hi, John.
- Hey, man.
Is this guy giving you any trouble?
You giving my friend trouble?
Listen, I cannot sell you guys beer
after 2:00 in the morning.
Well, I'm here to turn back the time.
Matt, take your beer and leave.
- Look, John, it's not that big...
- Do it!
Thanks.
You got any Bud in bottles?
I told you he's crazy.
Just keep moving.
Fuck it, man!
You wanna get caught,
you wanna fucking fry, go ahead.
Treat your friends this way.
Talk about speeding out.
Yeah!
Find the gun.
Fucking shit!
Moko, come here.
Now we'll see if that
gun of yours still works.
You know, you're a crazy motherfucker.
You know that?
You want a beer?
You trying to get me drunk, Matt?
I wish it was me who narced.
What?
Who narced on John.
And I don't even care right now
if you tell anybody what I just said.
But don't tell anybody what I just said.
I mean, I respect the person who narced.
You know, even if it was Mike.
Especially if it was Mike.
It wasn't Mike.
How do you know? Was it you?
It was you.
I didn't think I'd be the only one.
Don't tell Layne.
Of course I won't.
God, weren't you
scared of people finding out?
Yeah.
But I kept seeing her face, Clarissa.
Didn't you keep seeing her face?
I mean, it affected me. Didn't it affect you?
It did.
I mean, we knew Jamie, right?
And there she is, dead,
right there in front of us.
And even that close,
we don't even feel like we've lost anything.
At least I didn't, and that got me the most.
I couldn't even cry for her, Matt.
I mean,
I cried when that guy in Brian's Song died.
You'd at least figure I'd be able to cry
for someone we hung around with.
It'll hit us. I know it will.
Probably at her funeral.
Sometimes I think it'd
be a lot easier being dead.
No, that's bullshit.
You couldn't get stoned anymore.
I hear it's the same sensation.
I like you.
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, I'm gonna take care of you
till the end.
Gonna take care of you. I'm gonna find you.
Someone's gotta take care of you.
I'm gonna take care of you, okay?
Damn it, John! Where the fuck are you?
Ellie don't drink.
Looks like she does something
with this mouth of hers.
Ellie's a nice girl.
I'm sure she is.
Like, real nice.
Let's just see
what kind of trick she knows here, huh?
Oh, yeah, baby.
That's nice. That is real nice.
Would you please not do that, John?
Come on, baby.
Not so quick. You're making me hot.
Please, John, stop that!
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
Please!
Cool.
You hear that?
You, eat me!
Don't give me no shit! You eat me!
No, you eat me!
No, you eat me!
You eat me, asshole!
No, you eat me, asshole!
Shut up before I call the cops!
You shut up!
Yeah?
Call them.
You better settle down, John.
You try it.
I better not.
You come here and you sit down.
We don't wanna attract attention, man.
Come on, Feck. Fire your gun.
Bet you haven't fired it in years.
It's not something that I just shoot off
without reason.
Why not?
It's got a sentimental value.
Is this the gun you wasted the chick with?
It is.
I bet you look back with pride, huh?
It's something I did.
You wanted to show her who was boss.
I don't know if you can understand.
I loved her.
So why'd you kill her?
Did she tell you to eat shit?
No.
No.
Come on, Feck.
I'm with you. Man, I killed a girl, too.
I wanted to show the world who's boss.
What's that?
Nothing. Close your ears.
You better give me the gun, John.
I didn't need no gun.
I did mine with my hands.
I was right there.
I was right on top of her. I was face to face.
I wasn't even mad, really.
She didn't look too surprised.
Just a little stoned.
After a few minutes,
her face puffed out,
and it turned dark purple
and she just stared at me.
She couldn't move.
She couldn't scream.
I had total control of her.
I had total control of her.
It all felt so real.
It felt so
real!
She was dead there in front of me
and I felt so fucking alive!
Is that how you felt, Feck?
Not quite, man.
Funny thing is,
I'm dead now.
They're gonna fry me for sure.
Don't say that.
Layne's gonna help you out.
Layne?
What the fuck is Layne...
Layne's gonna send me off to Portland
and hide me out in
some dark room for 20 years.
Will I end up like you, Feck?
You think I want that?
No.
You don't.
Layne was never really a friend anyway.
He doesn't even know me.
I'll be your friend.
I like you.
I'm glad we decided to go against Layne.
Sometimes I feel like
I don't even know him anymore.
He's lost. Let's get some sleep.
You weren't supposed to get old.
Hit him again!
I'm awake. I'm awake.
Fuck.
Hi.
Can you tell us anything about the murder?
Are you the killer?
What?
Don't I even get a fucking phone call?
So, now we get married, right?
No.
Let's get stoned instead.
That'd be great.
I could just lie here all day,
cut school and soak up the rays.
Shit, school.
I really shouldn't miss Burkewaite's class.
You really do have the hots for that guy,
don't you?
No.
I just,
I don't know, respect him.
You respect an adult?
I really do need to get stoned.
We'll stop at my house
on the way to school.
I think I have some Feckweed left.
I feel like
someone dipped me in used cooking oil.
We could take a shower.
I mean, you could, you know, by yourself.
No.
What am I supposed to do then?
I mean, what am I
supposed to do with him?
Look. If it's gonna be a hassle...
No, no hassle. Okay, no hassle.
Be right back, okay?
You're supposed to raise him right.
The both of them, for that matter.
You're supposed to control them.
Right, it's that easy, huh?
I mean, just tell them what to do,
tell them what not to do. Perfect kids.
You know it's not that impossible.
My father managed to raise me right.
Your father beat the shit out of you.
So what?
It'd make him listen, wouldn't it?
Big fucking talk.
Matt.
Matt?
I'm upset, Matt.
Kick that idiot out of the house then.
Suppose I just kick you out of the house?
Tim didn't come home last night.
- Did you hear me?
- You got any spare dope?
Shit. I don't believe this.
Your little brother, he's only 12 years old.
He hasn't come home.
He hasn't called.
God knows what he's doing.
What am I supposed to do?
I'm not his mother.
Then I'm not his mother either.
I am nobody's mother.
I give up this mother bullshit.
It's not worth it.
You're all mistakes anyway.
Don't give up, Mommy.
I'm gonna leave you all,
just like your father did.
Jesus, Ma, settle down, okay?
Tim's all right.
Look, everything's just a little crazy now,
a little out of control, okay?
Look, I got somebody
waiting outside for me.
I'm in a rush. We'll talk later.
I'm gonna take this joint.
And don't worry about Tim, okay?
I'll get him home.
Yeah, it really shocked me.
I think killing is wrong.
And what about all those people going to
see the body afterwards?
Yeah, that shocked me, too.
I think they should have arrested John.
John?
Well, he killed Jamie.
You knew the killer?
Yeah, you know, we...
We both kind of knew the killer.
You know, as well as, in addition to,
you know, who he killed, too.
I mean, because of that, it's...
It's pretty hard for us to be...
Objective?
Yeah, that's it, objective.
You know, since we did know
the two alleged people
involved and everything.
You know, and whereas we might
be all upset this morning, or something,
you know, we're not because of the fact
that we're not objective at all.
I also play guitar, by the way.
You don't even know what a true friend is.
I'm tired.
You call Samson Tollet a friend?
Don't I get a phone call?
Enough of a friend to cover up for?
Help him hide the body?
Maybe even help him kill the poor girl?
I didn't kill nobody.
Did he tell you why he did it?
Were you even curious?
Did you even give a flying fuck?
These are stupid questions.
I know my rights. I know I get a phone call.
You don't have any rights just yet, Layne.
We haven't arrested you.
Great.
See you.
Okay.
Okay. Okay.
Go. Make your phone call.
Go call one of your precious friends.
I asked you a question.
I didn't know her, okay?
I just wanna say it was
horrible what those kids did.
And the whole incident points
up a fundamental moral breakdown
in our society.
Thank you, Kevin, for your insightful,
self-righteous indignation.
I'd still like to hear from Tom.
Would you just quit staring at me
like that, man?
- Clarissa.
- Sorry I'm late.
You knew Jamie, right?
You were one of her friends.
Describe to us how you remember her.
Remember her?
Yeah, what she looked like,
what she meant to you.
You're bullshit, man.
I mean, what gives you the right
to put Clarissa on the spot like that?
I mean, she's upset, man.
Her friend is dead.
Are you upset, Clarissa?
Are you?
I mean, if you are,
come on, let's get it off your chest.
Fuck you.
Why don't you just leave her alone?
Look, fuck you, man.
Because I don't buy it.
You don't give a damn!
I don't give a damn! Nobody in this
classroom gives a damn that she's dead!
It gives us a chance to feel superior
and to point up
a fundamental moral breakdown in society,
but it doesn't really affect us, does it?
Because if it did, none of us would be
in this classroom right now.
We'd be out on the street,
half-crazy from lack of sleep,
hunting down Samson Tollet with a gun.
That's a reprehensible attitude.
Just shut up, Kevin!
Are we gonna be tested on this shit?
You know,
it's gonna be like this all day, man.
Teachers lecturing us
what kind of monsters we are.
I can't handle much more.
I say we split. Got just the place, too.
Come on, Clarissa. We're taking the day off.
Yeah, check... Check's in the mail.
Feck, where the hell have you been?
Where's John?
John...
He's gone.
He's gone to the river.
I'm dying.
Put up your hands!
Company.
Hello. Hello. Who is this?
This just blows my mind, man.
We're celebrities.
Just what you always wanted?
Yeah, well, you know, I mean, it's a start.
I hear they're having an
open-casket funeral for Jamie.
That's gross.
I know, I think it's in bad taste.
This entire episode is in bad taste.
You young people are
a disgrace to the human race,
to all living things, to plants even.
Shouldn't even be seen
in the same room as a cactus.
What's that?
Oh, my God. Not again.
- Is it dead?
- It's a dummy.
I'm getting out of here, God damn it.
I told you guys this was stupid.
No, no, no, hold it.
What are you doing?
Are you crazy? Don't throw rocks.
It's a person. Maybe he's still alive.
No, it's Ellie.
Ellie?
It's a sex doll.
Who's Ellie?
That's Ellie, Feck's girlfriend.
I wonder what she's doing here.
It's just like, you gotta make the
best of it while we're still alive
because any day now,
boom and we're dead.
You wanna know what I think?
No, Mike.
Somebody could just murder you,
you know.
Or Russia could send over
a whole batch of nuclear bombs.
I say we just get the Russians stoned.
It might mellow them out a touch.
Where's John?
Forget about John.
God, would you just forget about him?
And you, I should kick your ass right here.
What did I do?
Cool it!
Leave me alone!
You don't know what's going on.
None of you know what's going on.
I'll find him myself.
Layne.
John!
You've been awake the whole night
searching for the asshole, haven't you?
He's not an asshole!
He's an asshole.
He doesn't give a shit about anything.
His friends, himself.
He doesn't care if he dies.
Can't you see by the way he's acting?
Would you listen to me?
I know you don't care about him that much.
You know that?
I fucking know you, Layne.
You get these... These ideas in
your head and you don't think.
And this idea of helping John out,
it's not a good idea.
You have a better idea?
Yeah.
Turn him in.
You would do that, wouldn't you?
I did.
You should finish the job, Layne.
I should kill you for even saying that.
Oh, man,
you're talking shit and you know it!
You turn on us so easily!
I thought you were a fucking friend!
I knew that me and John
were alone all along!
- Layne!
- Let him go.
What's with him?
He's upset.
John!
John!
John!
John!
Matt!
You shouldn't have hit me.
Don't be stupid, Tim.
You finked on John.
I'm your brother. Give me the gun.
Look, I'm sorry I hurt you, okay?
I was upset.
Now give me the gun, okay?
God damn it, Tim!
I'm your brother.
They fucking killed him.
They killed him.
Because there was no hope for him.
There was no hope at all.
He didn't love her.
He didn't feel a thing.
I
At least loved her.
I cared for her.
I mean, it...
You understand, don't you?
Sure you do.
I don't like killing people.
But sometimes it's necessary.
That's enough for now.
I...
I'd like you all to leave now.
I'm very tired and sort of depressed.
I lost a good friend today, you know.
No, no
No, my darling
Please don't say your last goodbye
Please don't say
Say your last, your last goodbye
Yes, you are leaving me
Leaving me here to cry
You know I love you
I love you
But I gave her all my love
You knew I loved you
But I gave her all my love
Why can't we stay together?
Why can't we love each other?
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
