<i>In the South African
capital of Pretoria,</i>
<i>three black people
were hanged this morning.</i>
<i>They were all members of the
outlawed African National Congress.</i>
<i>This is our land.
This is what we fought for.</i>
<i>It belongs to us.
It belongs to us.</i>
<i>...Communist manufactured
guns, ammunition and explosives</i>
<i>have been seized in
Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth.</i>
<i>We're considered by some
people to be a doomed nation,</i>
<i>which we don't
believe we are.</i>
<i>Keeping black
and white separate.</i>
<i>Policies which the outside
world universally condemns.</i>
<i>Whites cannot forever
rule 25 million blacks.</i>
<i>They are a tribe of whites
fiercely determined to survive.</i>
<i>Only one African country is left
with a totally white government.</i>
<i>The battle for
South Africa has...</i>
<i>This is the first startling message
we have heard about apartheid.</i>
<i>It means just
what it sounds like...apart.</i>
<i>My mother gave me
the name Rogerio,</i>
<i>and then my father gave me
the name Patrick.</i>
<i>When I was small
I used both of them,</i>
<i>but I like the one
my father gave me.</i>
<i>Patrick. Patrick Chamusso.</i>
<i>My father had come
from Mozambique</i>
<i>with the migrant workers
to the mines of South Africa.</i>
<i>When I was 15
I started to work underground.</i>
<i>I became a man in that place.</i>
<i>The plant that provides oil
for the whole country.</i>
<i>A hard place.</i>
<i>I always thought, "Patrick,
you are from outside.</i>
<i>"Be smart.</i>
<i>"Keep your head down for
yourself and for your family. "</i>
<i>I worked hard,
pulled myself up.</i>
<i>Made good friends
and a good life.</i>
<i>I was cruising, just cruising.</i>
<i>Who took my snuff?</i>
Precious, keep straight.
Mom!
Now. Change gears.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Hey, Precious!
<i>Sorry! Sorry! Precious,
you can't stop like that.</i>
Out!
No, Patrick!
Patrick, how am I
supposed to learn?
No!
Get out!
Nice moves, sissie.
Mrs. Stirling Moss.
<i>Sittin' here,
eatin' my heart out waitin'</i>
<i>Waitin' for some lover to call</i>
<i>I dialed about
a 1000 numbers lately</i>
<i>Almost rang the phone
off the wall</i>
<i>Gotta have some hot stuff
baby this evenin'</i>
<i>I want some hot stuff
baby tonight</i>
<i>I need some hot stuff
baby this evenin'</i>
<i>Gotta have some hot stuff</i>
<i>Gotta have some love tonight</i>
<i>I want some hot stuff</i>
<i>I need some hot stuff</i>
Hey!
<i>It's a scaevola.</i>
How does it
grow up here?
<i>What's this now?</i>
<i>Patrick Chamusso, baas.</i>
<i>That's my family, baas.</i>
Give me your pass.
Out of the car.
Come, everyone, out!
<i>It's my camera, baas.</i>
Whose car is this?
<i>My car, baas.</i>
Patrick. Where are you going? Patrick?
<i>I'm going home, baas.</i>
And where do you get the money for
this nice car and that nice camera?
<i>No, baas, I work.
I have a job.</i>
<i>I'm a foreman, baas.
I work at Secunda.</i>
Go ahead. Search him.
<i>Hold still.
What's wrong with you, huh?</i>
Hey, you, come here.
Down! Down.
Christ, they
really buggered you up.
So, you leave the country,
train in exile with the ANC,
<i>come back as a terrorist.</i>
<i>Boom! There goes
a railway track.</i>
<i>You say you're in a struggle to
make life better for the blacks.</i>
<i>But who do you hurt?
Blacks, whites, everyone.</i>
<i>If you succeed,</i>
who do you think
is going to be running things?
The ANC? No.
<i>We'll be taking our marching
orders from Moscow, my friend.</i>
From the communists, that
train you, supply you weapons.
And now, my job
is to see to it
that you are hanged.
<i>But I don't want to hang you.
I want to help you.</i>
Patrick! Security.
<i>I'm going to
charge you, boy.</i>
<i>Baas, wait.</i>
No, man. You people have
your own toilets over there.
<i>Baas, please. There's a
cracked pipe in ash washing.</i>
<i>If you hold him,
we're one man short.</i>
<i>It's an emergency, Priority A.</i>
Just one time.
<i>He's a cheeky Kaffir.</i>
<i>Yes, he's a cheeky Kaffir.</i>
<i>I'm telling you,
you're lucky, boy.</i>
<i>Thank you, bass.</i>
Up, up.
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up! You, up!
Up, up, up, up, up, up!
Head up!
Breathe! In! Out!
Come on!
Pass! Pass, pass!
Spread out, spread out!
Pass. Head up! Head up!
Spread out!
Spread out, spread out!
Yes!
<i>What's your name?</i>
His name is Sixpence.
My nephew from Innesport.
<i>His mother passed away
so he's staying with me now.</i>
Be here next Tuesday.
<i>You're in the team.
Well done, boy.</i>
<i>That's my boy!</i>
Next time,
you must ask for permission.
<i>Don't just join in.</i>
Boys, boys.
We have a new player
on the team.
His name is Sixpence.
No fighting!
Yes, coach.
Yes, coach.
Yes, coach!
Good.

<i>Born of the people

Hi, boy.
What is this to do with you?
This is my radio,
this is my house.
Do you want to
see me in jail?
<i>That's good, big boy.</i>
I tell you what.
Go pack your bag.
<i>I'll drive you to the station,
buy you a ticket to Mozambique.</i>
<i>You can join up with the boys
of Umkhonto we Sizwe,</i>
come back
and liberate the country.
You, better wash yourself
before you get in my bed.
Your bed?
Mmm.
What are you looking at?
You.
And, how do I look?
Not bad.
Patrick!
<i>Girls don't like trucks.</i>
They like books,
dolls, you know.
Ta-da!
<i>It's the suite of my
dreams, Patrick. Hmm?</i>
Then get a job
and buy it yourself.
A job?
Is that what you want?
Patrick, when people come to
visit and we sit in that room,
<i>I'm ashamed.</i>
<i>Baby, you're
a boss man now.</i>
A foreman.
<i>Precious, we can't afford it.</i>
Keep your finger off the trigger
until you are ready to fire.
<i>Okay, ja.</i>
I got him, Pa.
Next time keep your eyes open. Yeah.
All right,
pick up the weapon.
No, no, no.
Always at the target.
Put your weight
on your front foot.
<i>I can't.</i>
Come on, come on!
Run, run, run!
<i>I'm going to fetch him.</i>
Maybe at Christmas
when I get my bonus.
<i>Maybe at Christmas
we'll be dead.</i>
<i>Hey, don't talk like that.</i>
<i>I'm going away.</i>
<i>Tell me you'll miss me.</i>
Come on.
Like a hole in my head.
<i>Come with me
down paradise road</i>
<i>This way please</i>
<i>I'll carry your load</i>
<i>This you must believe</i>
Katie, you may be
in a position, God forbid,
when knowing how to shoot
could save your life.
<i>Ja. I mean... We've got to
look out for robbers.</i>
<i>Susan's mum and dad
were killed in the night.</i>
<i>It's not the robbers
we worry about.</i>
<i>It's the terrorists.
The communists.</i>
This family is a target.
I hate this.
All this talk of guns
and killing.
Anna.
Enough!
Thank you.
Patrick.
Precious, we beat the Spartans!
We made it to the finals.
Secunda Lions.
Forwards ever.
Backwards never.
<i>Oh, Precious, phone the plant
for me. Tell them I'm sick.</i>
<i>Patrick? Who's that?</i>
<i>I heard a girl there,
Patrick. Who is that?</i>
<i>Precious, it's a woman
waiting to use the phone.</i>
I am warning you!
Precious,
stop your nonsense.
<i>Phone Secunda.
Tell them I'm sick.</i>
<i>Precious?</i>
Precious? Precious?
Pass the ball!
Pass! Sixpence, pass!
Go, Sixpence, go!
Go, Sixpence! Go!
Goal!
No.
No.
My father left when I was 10.
And I never saw him again.
<i>Its better he doesn't know.</i>
Try to
visit again soon.
Please.
<i>It's hard.</i>
<i>I'll come when I can.</i>
<i>Oh, wow!
What's that?</i>
<i>Fire, man! It's fire!
Shit, man!</i>
Watch your mouth.
<i>I hope it's the school.</i>
<i>It's Secunda.</i>
<i>Earlier this week, Minister
of Police, Mr. Louis le Grange,</i>
<i>warned that South Africa is in a
virtual state of war... Is it safe?</i>
Day or night,
the plant keeps going.
What?
Bye-bye.
Bye.
<i>The plant here in Secunda
uses a revolutionary technique</i>
<i>to convert coal into
oil and petrol. Bye, Ma.</i>
<i>Almost half of South Africa's
cars use the fuel</i>
<i>processed in this
particular plant.</i>
<i>Perhaps it's too early
to speculate,</i>
<i>but if this is confirmed
as a terrorist attack</i>
<i>it'll be
the largest sabotage...</i>
Come on, arms up.
<i>You think you're
so clever, huh?</i>
You and your
bloody terrorists!
<i>...two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,</i>
nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen.
I think it makes nine.
Okay. Count.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
<i>One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten...</i>
<i>I've done nothing!</i>
Come on.
<i>Chamusso's
in the checked shirt.</i>
Patrick Chamusso?
Yes.
Yes, what do you want from me?
Let him go!
Let him go!
What are you doing?
Daddy! Take your
hands off my daddy!
Get away from him!
Daddy!
Daddy.
Let me go!
Patrick! Let me go!
Patrick!
Precious! Let her go.
Precious!
Patrick!
Patrick.
<i>I'm very sorry,
Mrs. Chamusso.</i>
We have to ask your
husband some questions.
I wanna be your friend.
I want to be your friend.
Who is your contact?
<i>I'm asking you a question now,
Patrick. Look at me in the eyes.</i>
I said, look at me!
<i>Are you a member of the ANC?
It's simple.</i>
You think a communist
is a good thing?
What the hell
have you done to him?
Here. Sit up.
Get up.
<i>It's water.</i>
Slowly.
Slowly. Slowly.
I want a doctor
to take a look at him.
Now!
Here.
<i>Why won't they
let him go, Zuko?</i>
Why are they
still holding him?
<i>And Johnny, too.
I don't know.</i>
<i>And that night he
wasn't even in Secunda.</i>
<i>You know him, Zuko,
he's not into politics.</i>
<i>His family, his work, his
football. That's Patrick's life.</i>
I must go to Joburg
and find a lawyer.
<i>That's what I must do.</i>
<i>He doesn't have
the right a lawyer.</i>
Only if they charge him.
Charge him with what?
At the moment, they can hold
him as long as they want.
What am I supposed to do?
What am I
supposed to do now?
I want to know who you are.
<i>When I look at a man
I don't see a terrorist.</i>
I see a human being.
I told you 100 times.
<i>I'm innocent.
I am not ANC.</i>
<i>How many men
in your maintenance team?</i>
<i>A foreman
and two other men.</i>
You, Zuko September,
Johnny Piliso.
Who collects the vehicles?
Who signs for the keys?
The foreman on the shift.
That night,
that would be you.
<i>I told you, I wasn't there.
I was sick.</i>
Did you see a doctor?
Yes.
Got a sick note?
Yes. Yes.
<i>The doctor's note
was forged, Patrick.</i>
We know that.
You are lying.
<i>I'm a coach
for Secunda Lions.</i>
Township kids. We were
in the playoffs at Ermelo.
We stayed an extra day.
I have no holiday left
this year.
<i>And I don't want to
lose my job.</i>
<i>It's good what
Patrick does with those boys.</i>
Giving them a focus.
Keeping them off the streets.
Good man.
So, that day, he takes the
boys to the playoffs in Ermelo.
They win. 2-1.
And then he drives somewhere.
Takes off in the Kombi.
Do you know where he went?
Who he met?
In the middle of the night?
Patrick.
<i>It's Sunday.
Day of rest.</i>
<i>Let's get you cleaned up.</i>
Take a drive.
Between you and me, Patrick,
apartheid cannot last.
Twenty-five million blacks.
Three million white people.
We are the underdogs.
We are the ones under attack.
Amen.
Amen.
<i>I'm starving.</i>
Maybe Patrick would like
some gravy please, Elsie.
Cool drink, Mom?
Thank you.
<i>Patrick, don't tell me.
Let me guess.</i>
<i>No, I'm Shangaan.</i>
Oh.
I usually can tell.
Patrick also has
daughters. Two.
Is it? How old?
<i>Albertina, she's eight.</i>
<i>Lindiwe, she's six.</i>
<i>How sweet.
That's the best age.</i>
<i>The little one, she's naughty.</i>
She is very bad.
Patrick has a beautiful wife.
<i>Miss Highveld Africa...</i>
1972?
Yes.
She likes nice things.
Nice clothes.
Nice furniture.
Is there something
wrong with that?
No. Nothing wrong.
<i>She's got class, man.</i>
She does.
Sing along, Patrick.
You know the words, yeah?
Were you singing, Patrick?
Celebrating
the terrorist attacks?
Ask anybody in Secunda
and they will you that Patrick
Chamusso is not a terrorist.
They would laugh at you.
I saw your boys.
I watched them play.
That one kid. Sixpence?
<i>He's really good, huh?</i>
After supper you dropped the
boys off at the school in Ermelo.
Then you took off
somewhere.
In the morning you were
late picking them up.
<i>That's what they said.</i>
We checked the mileage
on the vehicle.
That tells us
you drove to the plant.
You fixed the mines.
No.
Then where were you
that night, Patrick?
When you dropped the boys off,
where did you go?
<i>He's pissed off now.</i>
Watch this, Mommy.
I used to do that
when I was a girl.
You show me.
<i>There's another woman.</i>
Not far from here.
<i>That's where I was.</i>
Yes?
I love my wife.
<i>You're lying.</i>
Nice try, Patrick.
Did you know your friend
Johnny had a weak heart?
<i>Is somebody here?</i>
<i>Is somebody here?</i>
Hello.
<i>Hello?</i>
Precious!
What have they done to you?
What have they done to you?
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Precious.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
Nic Vos!
I am talking to you, Nic Vos!
I will stand up in court
and this is what I will say.
After the game, I fetched the
boys to the school in Ermelo.
I went to Secunda.
After that I opened
the east perimeter fence.
Patrick, stop!
No one saw me.
I was there ten minutes
and I was gone.
You can do anything
you want to do with me.
But you must release my wife!
What kind of man are you who
does these things to a woman?
What kind of man are you?
Pray.
<i>I am talking to you,
Nic Vos. Here it is.</i>
<i>I will stand up in court and this
is what I will say. I let him go.</i>
<i>After the game,
I fetched the boys.</i>
<i>I took the boys
to the school in Ermelo.</i>
<i>He didn't do it.
I let him go.</i>
He confessed on tape.
Confessed? To what?
That he cut a hole
in the fence?
They got in with a key.
You know that.
<i>He said he did it. Okay?
That's good enough for me.</i>
So we lie
to get a conviction.
We hang him.
<i>We lock him in jail for the rest of
his life for something he didn't do.</i>
<i>In the meantime, there's a
terrorist loose on the ground.</i>
What the hell is
the point in that?
Our job is
to find the terrorists.
Daddy!
That night I was in Evander.
You told me
it was finished.
You told me 10 times,
you said it was finished.
<i>It's true. It is finished.</i>
So why did you
go to her house?
I will make this right.
I promise
I will make this right.
<i>Comrades and compatriots,
duty calls.</i>
<i>The battle lines are drawn.</i>
<i>The African National Congress
commands and urges all of us</i>
<i>to act for unity and as one
to engage the enemy.</i>
<i>If united, there's action.</i>
<i>The time has come.</i>
<i>This government of slavery.</i>
<i>This government of oppression.</i>
<i>This apartheid monster
must be removed from power.</i>
<i>They will never stop the rage.</i>
<i>The arrests, the beatings,
the killings.</i>
<i>Until the day
we end white rule.</i>
<i>Let this be the year of the
most powerful offensive</i>
<i>against the apartheid regime.</i>
<i>Let this be the year
of the great unity action.</i>
<i>Let this be the year
of the great leap forward</i>
<i>to the threshold of victory.</i>
OBADl: Have you told anyone that
you were coming to Mozambique?
No.
Not even my family.
Once you cross that fence.
Once you decide to fight back,
everything is different.
You cannot contact anyone
on the other side.
That means no phone calls,
no letters.
You may never see
your family again.
Do you still wanna go on?
They have
killed my friend,
tortured my wife
for nothing.
Yes, I want to go on.
Yes. I want to go on.
<i>When's Daddy coming back?</i>
<i>He'll let us know.</i>
<i>You were asleep.
He didn't want to wake you.</i>
Girls, girls, stop asking
so many questions.
Just eat up.
Patrick.
OBADl: Fall in, man!
I know you.
Each one of you,
I know who you are!
I know why you are here.
Commander.
Murder the Boers.
<i>OBADl: We don't kill
indiscriminately.</i>
<i>OBADl: We're fighting
for freedom, comrades.</i>
South Africa belongs
to all who live in it!
We train you, we arm you,
we send you back.
The Boers, they capture you.
Will you be able
to hold steadfast?
Or will you begin to sing?
<i>We're ice-cool, Comrade.
We're from Soweto.</i>
<i>I'm from Soweto, Comrade. But if they
catch me, I will shit in my pants.</i>
The Boers, they kill you.
Are you ready to die?
Are you ready to die?
Yes, Commander!
Are you ready to die?
Yes, Commander.
Are you ready to die?
Yes, Commander!
Are you ready to die?
Yes, Commander!
Are you ready to die?
Yes, Commander! Yes,
Commander! Yes, Commander!
<i>There's the office here.
Where's the entrance?</i>
The entrance is here
on Avenida Julius Nyerere.
Where do the people
from the office stay?
<i>There's a house.</i>
Here.
How many?
Two to three cadres.
Comrade J.S.
<i>No, we don't know
where he stays.</i>
Zuma? Tambo?
Sir, these people,
they move around.
They sleep
in different places.
<i>One night there, the
other night... Betsy.</i>
Pete My Baby?
Where do they stay?
<i>In this...
What floor are they on?</i>
<i>Where's the arms cache?</i>
<i>Don't shake your head at me.</i>
When did these come in?
Yesterday.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye, mum.
Bye.
Bye-bye. See you, Mum.
Bye!
Bye-bye!
Bye-bye!
Going back to work?
Give you a lift.
<i>You've lost
your house now.</i>
Living in a one-room shack.
No money coming in.
Maybe I can help you,
Precious.
Use my influence.
Find you somewhere
better to live.
When you hear from
Patrick, you let me know.
<i>You must ask yourself...</i>
<i>"Where is he?"</i>
<i>"Who is he with now?"</i>
<i>"Where does he sleep
at night?"</i>
Yeah.
So many days,
so many weeks pass
sitting around here
thinking about my family.
Why I came here?
<i>Obrigado.</i>
OBADl:
On all the anniversaries,
my marriage, the birthdays,
in my mind, I see my wife and my kids.
And I put myself in that
place, there with them.
And I imagine
what it will be like
when South Africa is free
and I am home again.
And then my heart starts
to beat faster.
<i>Quanto?</i>
Attention, comrades.
Attention!
<i>There's Frelimo outside to
check our papers, so follow me.</i>
<i>Comrade, I don't have papers.</i>
Me, too.
Okay, the two of you,
you stay here.
OBADl: Come on, all of you.
<i>Could you be loved</i>
<i>And be loved</i>
Go! Go! Go!
Obadi? Obadi.
Hold on.
If you would
have planned it better
you could have blown up
the whole plant.
<i>There's different security
there now.</i>
Look out posts here, here,
Mmm-hmm.
<i>and here,
there's a new water pump.</i>
The water in there
is for chemical fires.
You must go there first.
The alarm. Everybody leaves.
The ground is cleared.
The workers are safe.
<i>There's no water
to put out chemical fires.</i>
The second bomb goes here
at the core reactor.
Boom, boom, boom.
The whole plant is gone.
Hot stuff.
Mr. Hotstuff.
<i>They stole
our brothers in Africa.</i>
<i>Run, oppressor, run</i>
<i>All are freedom fighters.</i>
<i>In South Africa, Mozambique,
Angola and Rhodesia.</i>
<i>Let them be strengthened.</i>
<i>Run out
of black-man's land</i>
This is the fight
for liberation.
<i>There were over forty
thousand of us in Angola,</i>
<i>training to go home
and liberate our country.</i>
<i>We were getting ready
for secret missions,</i>
<i>so we knew each other
by code names.</i>
<i>My friend from Mozambique had
already been given his name.</i>
<i>Pete My Baby.</i>
We shall be housed
with security and comfort.
<i>But me, Patrick Chamusso,
now I became Hotstuff.</i>
<i>Run out of black-man's land</i>
<i>Oh, yeah, now, now</i>
<i>Run out of black-man's land</i>
<i>Sing it one more time</i>
<i>Run, oppressor, run</i>
<i>Run out of black-man land</i>
<i>Sorry, sir. Latest informer's
reports from Swaziland.</i>
<i>Dankie.</i>
And here he is again
and again.
And again.
Limpet mines.
Red splint is inserted here.
The fuse is inserted here.
You pull the safety pin out.
After 15 minutes,
this circle here will be red.
And the bomb will explode.
Yes.
How long to empty the plant
after the first explosion?
Twelve minutes.
Maybe less.
Set the mines for 15 minutes,
just to make sure.
No one must die.
I know.
Okay.
<i>One, two...</i>
From now on your name
is James Mabuso.
James Mabuso.
Remember, when you get to Secunda,
keep away from your family.
Keep away from your wife.
Reason for entering
South Africa?
<i>I'm going to Florida
to buy parts for my business.</i>
Please, sit down.
Go.
Mr. Mabuso.
<i>I'll give you 14 days.</i>
Thanks.
<i>He's heading west.</i>
Probably rendezvous
in Secunda area.
Slowing down.
Slowing down.
Stopped. Go! Go!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
I thought you were a ghost,
man.
Precious, my kids.
<i>How's my family?</i>
They stay on Fifth Street now.
The company took back
the house.
<i>Precious is in Witbank.
She's got a job.</i>
<i>Don't worry.
I'm watching them.</i>
Thank you.
Hmm.
My husband
was the caretaker,
<i>but they've closed
the mine now.</i>
<i>They didn't
give me a pension.</i>
<i>I'm not supposed
to rent out rooms</i>
but I need the money.
<i>Five rand a week. And I'II...
I'll cook for you also.</i>
Out of the way! Out of
the way! Out of the way!
<i>He's a terrorist.
Pete My Baby.</i>
I killed him, Dad.
<i>All right. It's all right.
Daddy's here.</i>
I shot him, Dad.
He just came through.
He had a gun
but I shot him first.
You protected us.
You were brave.
You were strong.
<i>You did what you had to do,
darling. Darling...</i>
Who was he, Dad?
Why was he here?
He was a thief with a gun.
Some skelm from the township.
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>It's okay. It's all right.
It's all right.</i>
<i>It's all right.</i>
Precious.
Somebody left this for you.
<i>I don't want any trouble,
my girl. Okay?</i>
<i>It's done.</i>
Chewing gum?
Can you reach the plant
from that shaft?
The elevators still works.
If you worked underground,
you could.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
<i>He'll be coming out
at mine shaft number three.</i>
<i>That's correct. Repeat,
mine shaft number three.</i>
Go, go, go, go, go!
Get back. Back.
Back! Back! Police.
That door.
Right. Come on, boys.
Quietly.
Block every road
in every direction.
Echo Seven, Echo Seven.
Block every road
in every direction.
<i>I'll check the core reactor.
You search.</i>
Found it.
<i>Sierra 1 from Sierra 7.</i>
<i>Sir, they reported a man crashing
through the barrier at Kinross.</i>
<i>Two police down.
Repeat, two police down.</i>
Miriam!
<i>Excuse me, sir. There's
a girl outside to see you.</i>
Stop!
Stop!
Hands up!
Take off your clothes!
Take off your clothes!
Your pants! Take them off!
<i>He's clean.</i>
You people
will never learn.
<i>They'll probably
hang you.</i>
<i>Or if you're lucky you'll spend
the rest of your life in jail.</i>
<i>There's nothing else
you can do with me.</i>
My life is finished.
I may never see
my children again,
but when they speak
of their father,

<i>Years later, when I came
back to that township,</i>
<i>the neighbors said
that after that day,</i>
<i>Zuko and Sixpence

<i>He kept me there at that
farm for many months,</i>
<i>trying to find
where our leaders might be.</i>

<i>I was sentenced to 24 years
in prison</i>
<i>on a little island
at the bottom of Africa,</i>
<i>Robben Island.</i>
<i>There were almost
1000 of us.</i>
<i>Mostly men like me,
found guilty of treason.</i>
<i>Men who spent their days
breaking rocks.</i>
<i>So many hearts filled with
sorrow and filled with anger.</i>
<i>But our leader, our father,
he told us,</i>
<i>we could never be free</i>

<i>After five years
in that prison,</i>
<i>Precious, had written to say,
