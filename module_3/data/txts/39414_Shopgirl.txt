Come on. Come on out.
You want something? wanna eat?
There's some food out here.
Here it is.
It's in the kitchen.
Good night, Sylvia.
Mirabelle Buttersfield
moved from Vermont.
Hoping to begin her life.
And now she is stranded
in the vast openness of L.A.
She keeps working
to make connections.
But the pile of near misses
is starting to overwhelm her.
What Mirabelle needs is an omniscient
voice to illuminate and spotlight her.
And to inform everyone
that this one has value.
This one. Standing behind the counter
in the glove department.
And then to find her counterpart
and bring him to her.
So...
You have a student loan of $39,452.
And you're currently
paying it off at the rate of...
- $45 a month.
- Yes.
Do you think that you could
increase that amount to...
Let me just see.
$160 a month?
Well, I...
I would love to, but...
That's just not gonna happen.
- Oh, really.
- Yeah.
Hey!
I mean, hello. Hi.
- Do you need change?
- No, I'm fine.
OK.
Where do you work?
- Saks.
- Oh. Saks.
Cool.
Saks...
Saks Fifth Avenue?
Where do you work?
Uh... in my studio.
I'm an artist.
- Oh, yeah? Me, too!
- Oh, really? What kind?
I draw. What do you do?
I'm involved in stenciling.
You know Holydog Amplifiers?
I do their logo.
Here, I'll show you.
These are, like, some fonts I did.
You know.
Like, this one by my thumb's
an older one, obviously. And, um...
This is my favorite one. I've called
this font "Los Angeles" because...
"Los Angeles. "
It's my favorite one.
I'm an OK guy, by the way.
You didn't have to tell me that.
I didn't? How come?
- Well, I could tell.
- Well, how could you tell?
'Cause I'm a really poor
judge of character.
I'm a poor judge of character as well.
The worst.
Excuse me, young lady.
Um, two things.
One: I was wondering if I could
now borrow change from you
because my stuff's still damp.
And two:
Um, I was wondering if I could please
have your phone number
so that I could...
I could call you.
I'm Jeremy.
I will call you.
~ If you do want me
~ Gimme little sugar
~ If you don't want me
~ Don't lead me on, girl
~ But if you need me
~ Show me that you love me
~ And when I'm feeling blue
~ And I want you
~ There's just one thing
~ That you should do
~ Just gimme some kind of sign, girl
~ To show me that you're mine, girl
~ Oh. Yeah
~ Just gimme some kind of sign, girl...
Sorry.
I'll... I'll get it next time. Hey.
Sorry.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You look nice.
- Yeah? Yeah, thanks.
All right.
Um, OK.
Get ready to have the time
of your life.
OK.
I'm ready.
All right, young lady.
Fantastic, isn't it?
Yeah.
- Are we going in?
- Go in? Oh, no.
I just thought we'd look at it.
So... we would just sit here, then?
Yeah. Or walk around.
This place is called City walk.
It got eight out of ten
in my date book.
It's not called
"City-Go-and-See-a-Movie. "
Tickets are, like, ten bucks too, so...
I like it here. Peaceful.
I come here to think about fonts.
I've actually been
working on a font for you.
It's my most favorite one.
The Ls go like that.
- We could split it.
- OK. Let's split it.
Could I borrow two bucks?
Congratulations. You've officially
gone on a date with Jeremy.
Don't forget to hold the handle
when you lock the door.
- 52 steps. OK.
- OK.
- Well, thanks for driving me.
- Can I see your place?
I think I should go to bed.
I'm pretty tired.
Cool.
So...
- Good night.
- Oh, OK. OK, OK.
Well, here, let me give you my number.
Uh...
- You got a pen?
- Oh.
Uh, yeah. I do.
- You got paper?
- Oh.
Yeah, I do.
How high is that?
You ever jump off that? I would jump it.
- Mirabelle?
- Yeah?
Can I kiss you or what?
The point being?
Thank you.
Oh, hey, you look...
you look good, too.
- See you later.
- Hey, Jeremy?
Yeah?
Are you the kind of person
it takes time to get to know,
and then, once you get to know them...
they're fabulous?
- Yes. Yes. Absolutely.
- OK.
What? Yes.
- OK.
- OK.
No? OK.
I love you.
No kiss. Good night.
Good night.
Night!
You see. Susan.
Your husband doesn't understand
that it's afterglow
that's important to a woman.
- Uh-huh.
- Much more important than sex itself.
- Hm.
- A woman needs to be held.
Even if.
And science has shown this.
- It's by someone she doesn't care about.
- Uh-huh.
Protective hormones are released.
And the amount of hormones released
depend on the degree
to which she is held.
The first and best
is the complete surround.
He wraps you in both arms.
whispers how beautiful you are.
Second best is the arm around.
He's next to you.
But with one arm around you.
Third is. He's just next to you on his elbow.
But he rests his hand on your stomach
and looks at you.
Fourth is you snuggling up to him
with your head on his chest.
while he looks away into space.
But when the first best happens. You feel
completely. wonderfully like a woman.
Once a year. we have
to feed our crocs a whole carcass.
God, OK.
From the skin. Fur. Bones...
Jeremy?
...around a wild crocodile
because I'd be within strike range...
- Jeremy?
... got a mouthful of pig.
He's bringing it into the shallows.
Jeremy?
we've never seen him do it.
Let's hope he does it.
He'll pick it up out of the water.
Sink his teeth into it. And then...
Jeremy!
wow.
Jeremy!
watch this. Here we go.
See his tail sticking up?
Oh. He's ripped it.
Whoo! And here he goes again.
Yeah!
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hi. Hello...
- Hello?
- Hello. Hey.
Is this... Is this Jeremy?
Yeah.
- Do you know who this is?
- Yeah. It's Mirabelle.
Did you just dial me?
Yeah.
Uh... did you know that...
- Um...
- Um... what?
Uh...
- That you what?
- That, uh...
- Oh...
- What?
Nothing.
- Oh.
- Oh, God.
OK, well, um...
Mirabelle...
I was wondering
if you want me to come over.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Yeah. I'm just hanging out, really.
- Oh. Great.
- Yeah.
- OK. I'm gonna come over then.
- OK.
- Like. when?
- Well, um...
I'm in the middle
of a lot of things right now, so...
maybe, like, in ten minutes?
Hi.
Hi.
- I brought fries.
- I can tell.
How could you tell?
- I can see through the bag.
- Oh, yeah. They're really good.
- Come on in.
- Yeah? Great.
Oh, great place, man.
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- That's OK. Hey, is that the bedroom?
- What?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- We'll need a condom.
- Oh, oh. I got it, I got it, I got it.
- Oh, shit.
- What?
- It's a mint.
- What?
I... I grabbed the wrong package.
It's a mint, not a condom.
- Do you have one?
- No.
This is stupid.
Ooh, yeah!
Do you have, um, a baggie?
- What?
- If you had, like, a Jiffy baggie,
Well, I could, like, use that, you know?
Oh, God.
- You're going to have to go and get one.
- OK. Cool.
- Where do you keep them?
- What?
The Jiffy baggies.
Where do you keep them?
No, a condom.
kind of breaks the romantic mood.
Do you want to just hug?
Yeah.
Say, excuse me, bro?
- That was quick.
- Yeah.
- Where'd you get it?
- Well, I was out there,
and I bumped into your neighbor, Kenny.
I just asked him if he had any...
- Oh, God.
... and he does, so great.
Do you still want to do it?
Do you want a massage?
- Ow!
- What happened?
- Ow! Someone's hitting my balls.
- Someone?
Bad Sylvia!
I'm sorry. Ow! Are you OK?
Yeah, it's like someone
throwing marshmallows at me.
- Ow.
- Are you OK to?
Yeah. Does this happen often?
Yeah. Every night.
Maybe I should just go home.
No.
No, stay.
Amplifiers are so underappreciated.
What?
They could be so cool-looking, and nobody
cares about design. It pisses me off.
Mac designs a cool computer -
everybody goes out and they buy it!
And a band, a rock-and-roll band,
lives or dies by their amplifiers,
and they're sold like refrigerators.
That's ridiculous, come on.
The amps should have mystique.
I mean, yeah.
Amps should be sold like cool things.
You know, like cars, like swords.
Not like appliances.
And that is why
my boss's business is going under.
Because he views it all as merch.
That's merchandise.
You should do something about it.
Huh?
He's never coming to one
of my parties again. Never.
They both looked so fat.
- Ugh. The worst.
- The second floor is great.
You want something?
Seen anything you want?
Nothing here.
But that Stella McCartney dress is good.
Perfect.
- Excuse me?
- Oh. Yes, I'm sorry.
- Is he famous?
- He's on that show Extraterrestrials.
- Oh, I haven't seen that.
- Neither have I.
How'd you know who he was, then?
Osmosis.
- would you like to see something?
- Um, yeah.
Those gray ones
and those black ones.
OK.
How does it work?
Is it one size fits all, or?
They come in different sizes
but mostly they'll fit anybody.
Unless...
you know, she's...
big.
- I don't know. What do you think?
- Well, it depends on the dress.
What color is the dress?
Um...
I'll just...
I'll just get the gray ones.
Safe.
Safe?
why, do you think the black?
- I like the black.
- OK, I'll take the black.
OK.
It's $145.
- Just put it in there.
- OK.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Jerry. I need
your timecard in the office.
OK. Chet!
What?
- Hey. You know what I've been thinking?
- I have no idea.
Well, how could you? I'm the one
who's thinking it, obviously. Listen, Chet,
Who hangs out with
rock musicians on the road?
- Who?
- Other rock musicians.
And?
If you had someone
on the road with the band,
you know, a band that uses our stuff, with
someone who looks real sharp, you know,
someone the musicians could relate to,
bet you could sell
a lot more stuff that way.
- Do you have someone in mind?
- Yeah.
Me.
Think about it.
Here, smell.
Mm.
- Arigato.
- Arigato.
- Arigato.
- Arigato.
- Arigato.
- Arigato!
- Arigato.
- Arigato.
- Did you get my package?
- Oh!
It seems I'm sneaking up on you,
but I'm not.
- I was distracted by global commerce.
- Yeah.
So, did you get my package?
Uh, yes. Thank you.
And?
- Who are you?
- Good point. I'm Ray Porter. How are you?
Hi.
Look, I know you can't
be seen chatting up customers,
so why don't you just meet me Friday
for dinner at La Ronde,
that little place in Beverly Hills,
at eight o'clock.
You don't even have to give me
your phone number, just show up,
and if you don't, I'll just eat alone.
What was the name of the restaurant?
- La Ronde.
- What time?
Eight.
- You're on time.
- why not?
- Many people aren't.
- Oh, thank you.
- Would you like something to drink?
- Red wine.
What shade?
- Maroon.
- All right.
We'll have some of that fancy
maroon wine that you have.
So.
Who are you?
I'm a logician.
Meaning you work with numbers?
- I work with symbols.
- So you're a symbolic logician.
Exactly.
You're very well dressed
for a symbolic logician.
So how did you get my address?
Well, I lied to Saks,
then made one phone call to Information.
You have an unusual name -
Buttersfield.
Mirabelle Buttersfield.
while Ray explains his presumption
in getting her address and sending gloves.
Mirabelle sizes him up
and no alarm bells sound.
She asks several questions and gets
a kind of checklist for a man over 50:
Divorced. Two houses.
One in L.A. And one
in the computer-oriented Seattle.
which is the source of his wealth.
So...
would you give me your phone number?
Yes.
But the one question
she does not ask him.
which is foremost in her mind.
Is: "why me?"
- Hey!
- Hi.
Mind if I join you?
we see each other,
but we don't know each other.
- I'm Lisa.
- Mirabelle.
You ever have men
ask you out at the store?
Daily.
- And do you ever go out with them?
- Depends.
Somebody ask you out?
You want some advice?
You never call him.
But if he calls you, you talk to him,
then act like you have another call,
keep him on hold for a long time,
like longer than you think is possible.
And break dates.
Always break dates.
Right around the holidays,
because then he's just stuck.
And fellatio.
The sooner the better.
And a lot. Act like you love it.
Afterhe'saddicted, cut him off.
That's when you've got him.
Yeah, I couldn't do all that.
- How come?
- I'm from Vermont.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- May I come in?
- Yeah, please.
I think I can see
your apartment from my house.
- Really?
- Yeah, I live near the observatory,
and I can see the observatory
from your steps.
- Well, do you want to go, or stay?
- Well...
- Do you want to sit down?
- Yeah. Great. Thanks.
Oh.
Hm.
- Do you want something to drink?
- Pardon me?
- A drink?
- Uh, yeah. What do you have?
Uh...
- white wine?
- That's great.
- It's a nice neighborhood.
- Yeah, I really like it.
Mm-hm.
- Ah. Thank you.
- Sure.
Hm.
Uh...
- Should we go?
- Yeah, let's go.
Whoa, boy. Let's... Yeah.
It's a futon, right? Yeah. Futon.
You'll like the Cha Cha Cha.
It's fun. Whoo-hoo!
So...
- You know what you're gonna have?
- Yeah, I always get the jerk chicken.
Is that an order or a comment?
OK, we need some date questions.
So let's see... where's your family live?
Vermont.
Good relationship
with your father, I hope?
Well...
My dad doesn't speak very much.
After Vietnam.
Um...
OK. Be honest, maybe.
If this were a TV dating show,
would I be kicked off already
and you'd be on to the next guy?
Uh...
- You'd still be on the show.
- Good.
- I like your watch.
- Thank you.
It's a pretty unassuming Timex.
Yeah, but I'm out of date questions
and so I'm on to date comments.
Now I'm your watch.
Well, um, it was very nice.
- was I boring?
- No, was I?
A little bit.
Well, OK.
- I don't think that you should come in.
- I'm not asking to.
- Meaning?
- Meaning...
I'll see you again?
Oh. OK.
I'll be out of town about a week.
But would you like
to have dinner on Friday?
we could eat at my place.
OK.
Bobby Simmons is struggling in
this second half. He's only two for seven.
And both of them have members down.
He's got to get
better help from his receiver...
...Simmons is looking long.
He scrambles left. Oh. There's a big block...
...and see what he can find.
And Simmons with a long pass...
It's Simmons with the touchdown!
~ Here she comes
breaking through my window
~ In the early morning hours
~ For the moment I am disrupted
~ But in time
she'll make me smile
~ All the wondrous animals...
~ Bring us songs that calm
~ They do no wrong
~ They do no wrong
~ Just how much I miss you
~ Yeah, my stomach aches
in your absence
~ I don't know
what I'd do without you
- Man, you saved our ass tonight.
- Oh, no sweat.
- What was that amp?
- Holydog. It's the amp's amp.
You know, it's the one
I've been telling you about for three weeks.
Luther, see you on the bus, man.
- You want some dope?
- I'm afraid I'm gonna have to just say no.
- Good answer.
- I'm into athletics.
- Whatever. You want to ride with us?
- What?
- we got an extra bunk. Come on.
- Ride with you?
Yeah. Great. All right.
Let me get my gear,
I got to expedite a couple things...
- Come on!
- All right!
Hello?
Hey. It's Jeremy. Jere-me.
What are you doing?
- You mean now?
- Yeah. I want you to come over.
- It's too late.
- It's not too late.
It is for me. I have to get up.
Come over.
- I can't.
- Come on.
No.
Oh, come on,
I'm leaving town for a couple months.
- I can't.
- why not?
Because I'm seeing someone.
You have a nice house.
- Do you think it's too done?
- No. No, it's nice.
I didn't do it. It was
like this when I bought it.
Do you want to sit down?
- Or do you want to go outside?
- OK.
Do you want some wine?
Uh, later.
OK, yeah.
OK, there's the termite sign
and then down from that...
Yes! I can see your building
but not your apartment.
Take a look. See the blue sign?
Um, yeah.
Then right below that,
Silver Lake Boulevard. Now go over.
- Oh, yeah.
- See?
Huh.
Oh!
- You all right?
- Yes.
Did it pinch you?
There's a dealer on La Brea
who takes my drawings.
And they sell one occasionally.
- How often do you do one?
- About every six months.
why so few?
I don't know, really.
You sure you don't want some wine?
I'm sure. Thank you.
You want to see the rest of the house?
Let's go.
That's the three...
Got all three type recycle bins.
And the whole laundry room.
All the closets.
This just...
See, you just put things in there.
Garage.
The bedroom.
Nice view.
Let me turn off the phones.
Hi. It's Ray Porter.
Leave a message.
- All right. Here's where you sleep.
- OK, cool.
Here's your headphones.
Go to sleep with the music.
- Come on, we're gonna make Mojitos.
- Right.
- What's a Mojito?
- A fancy drink.
All right.
I want to fly!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Relax.
Relax your toes and breathe.
Relax your ankles and breathe.
Feel your hands. Flex them.
Fix your eyes
on an object in front of you.
Quiet your mind.
Feel the sensation of being alive.
Hey.
Is it OK if I make a speech?
OK.
Um...
I wasn't really looking
for anything permanent right now.
But I really like seeing you.
I'm just traveling so much right now...
that I thought maybe we should just...
keep our options open.
- Do you understand?
- I do.
OK, Miss Mirabelle of the fourth
floor, how did it go with the glove man?
Oh, yeah! Tell us all about it.
Spill it. Do you like him?
Does he like you?
Well, he said he was surprised
that he was interested in me.
Um...
I told her there was no possibility
that this was a long-term relationship.
She's just really too young for me.
- But you want to sleep with her?
- Well, yeah.
He said he wants to give it a try.
And I said that even though
this is not long-term, I still want to see her.
- And she understood?
- Oh, yeah.
He said he wants
to cut down on his traveling.
I essentially said that I'd like to sleep
with her when I'm in town.
He said he might, you know, stop traveling
completely. Then we'd decide what to do.
Even though it's a sexual relationship,
uh, we still should be able
to see other people.
So he was really taken with you?
Yeah, it seemed like it.
So you were really clear with her
that this relationship has no future?
Absolutely.
Well, you know how to find out
if he really loves you?
How?
You call him "sweetheart"
and watch what he does.
~ I don't know what it is
that makes me love you so
~ I only know I never
want to let you go
~ 'Cause you've started something.
Oh. Can't you see?
~ That ever since we met
you've had a hold on me
~ It happens to be true
~ I only want to be with you
~ It doesn't matter
where you go or what you do
~ I want to spend each moment
of the day with you
~ Oh. look what has happened
with just one kiss
~ I never knew that I could
be in love like this
~ It's crazy but it's true
~ I only want to be with you
~ You stopped and smiled at me
~ Asked if I'd care to dance
~ I fell into your open arms
~ And I didn't stand a chance
~ Now. Hear me tell ya.
I just want to be beside you everywhere
~ As long as we're together.
Honey. I don't care
~ 'Cause you've started something.
Oh. Can't you see?
~ That ever since we've met
you've had a hold on me
~ No matter what you do
~ I said. I only
want to be with you
We've been listening
to the same tapes for weeks.
What do you say we get some new stuff?
- What do they got?
- Um...
Mostly yoga, Pilates, gyrotechnics.
Hey, look at these.
- How to Love a woman.
- Yeah.
- You need that one.
- What?
Hm. Here's more relationship stuff.
- Here.
- we're getting it?
Let's just get 'em all.
we're on the road till February.
Um, OK.
- All right?
- All right.
- All right.
- All right.
Um, I guess we'll love women now.
- Happy Birthday.
- Thank you, mister!
- Anything you don't like you can take back.
- I never return anything you give me.
Maybe you've got a stash of stuff
you're dying to take back,
- just waiting for me to say it's OK.
- Silly.
By the way, you know,
my birthday's tomorrow.
It is really? OK. You know what that is?
That is a computer error.
I am going to fix that,
and next year everything will be perfect.
Next year? Next year?
Next year you'll be dead.
Do you want to open them tomorrow, then?
No, I love gifts.
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful!
- You like it?
- I love it! Thank you so much.
- Should I try it on?
- Yes.
Yes.
I got to go to New York
in about six weeks for an event weekend.
- You want to go? Could you get off?
- Oh, my God, yes!
You're going to need a dress.
- What kind of dress?
- It's a tuxedo thing. So whatever that is.
I could take you to Armani next week.
You look beautiful.
Excuse me.
Ray?
What?
I've never had a dress
fitted on me before.
Feel the sensation
of being alive.
Feel what it means to be alive.
Only from this place of pure existence
can you begin to change.
To turn yourself into a being
capable of loving another person.
Hey, you're going to be late.
You all right?
- I feel good.
- I feel good, too.
- I think I like the look of the brown ones.
- would you like...
Are you all right?
Yes. I'm fine, thank you.
I'll be back
in about five minutes.
Hey. It's Ray. You haven't returned
my calls. Are you all right?
I'm fine.
- You don't sound fine.
- I'm OK.
Hey, guess what? I'm not hanging up
until you tell me what's wrong.
- Have you ever taken antidepressants?
- No.
I do.
But I stopped.
And?
And, uh,
the doctor says that
maybe I shouldn't have.
All right. I'm going to come over there and
get you and we're going to go to the doctor.
You call him
and let him know we're coming.
Hey, I have something for you.
What's this?
I know it's a month away,
but it's your ticket to New York City.
Thanks.
- Hello?
- You're there.
Just.
- Hey, do you have plans for tonight?
- Somewhat.
Could you cancel them?
I could be there in three hours.
I could cancel them.
Good. Have you eaten yet?
No. I wanted to wait.
- Well. I'll bring some food from the plane.
- Plane food?
Private plane food.
Hi. It's Mirabelle. Leave your name
and number and I'll call you back.
Oh, hey, Mirabelle's machine,
it's Jeremy.
I'm calling you from the road. Um...
And I was calling to wish you
a happy Thanksgiving and all that.
And...
"I think I objectified you instead of treating
you like the unique being that you are. "
And, even better,
I get to use the roadie from the Hot Tears'
cell phone for free - no charge -
so I'm calling you for free.
- why are you leaving for work at 7:45?
- I got to go home and change.
Oh. Oh.
- That could take an hour.
- I know.
Do you want to stay
at my place sometime?
I live ten minutes from Saks.
Next time you come over,
just leave some clothes here
and you can go to work from here.
OK.
I won't be able
to see you till after Thanksgiving.
Don't stuff yourself with all that turkey.
See you, sleepyhead.
Well Cash was a great guy.
First time I ever met him...
- Don't tell me he was in prison.
- No. He actually...
I'm glad you called. You saved me from
a dinner of oatcakes and peanut butter.
You always used to take me out to nice
restaurants. why don't you take yourself?
- I didn't want to go out.
- I would've brought food.
- It's a little tricky.
- Oh.
- Eat some.
- Mm. Cholesterol.
- It's fish.
- It's eggs.
- 5000 little eggs.
- Oh, please.
Are you seeing somebody?
Yes.
No.
Is it serious?
It's hard to say. I...
I've been really clear with her.
Are you in love with her?
Question of the night.
How would you like to just lie there?
- What do you mean?
- Tonight, how would you, Ray Porter,
like to just lie there
and pretend like you're in Thailand?
And when it's all over,
I'll just slip away into the night.
Remember?
Hi. Whatcha doin'. Mister?
Just calling to say hello.
When you coming down?
Let me know.
we could have one of our nights.
OK. So...
Have a good night. Bye.
Dear Mirabelle. I suppose
the only way to say this is to say it.
I slept with someone.
It was not romantic or intimate.
And if I had it to do
over again. I wouldn't.
I am not telling you this because
I want our relationship to change.
I am telling you this only because
you deserve to know.
I am sorry.
Ray.
I put it in a letter because
I didn't want to change my mind
in the middle of telling you.
I can't go to New York with you now.
Oh, sweetie.
I can't go.
How could I go?
Hey.
You want to hear
the stupidest thing of all?
I somehow thought it would be all right.
Ray. we have to cancel...
Hey. Ray. It's Evan...
This is a call for Mr. Porter...
Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Mom.
- welcome.
Dinner's ready!
I'll be there in a second!
You getting along OK out there?
Yeah.
Saks is fine and...
I sell a drawing sometimes.
Mm.
we have a model
based on the T10-I formula.
You can modify it when necessary
and expand it when necessary.
The new formula is much denser,
much quicker to respond.
It can take in way more information than
the original formula, and is still containable.
Five men and five computers
can run the whole operation...
Hello?
Mirabelle, it's for you.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
why don't you come to New York?
OK.
~ Eight weeks aren't enough still
~ For all the other winters I've spent
~ She lived in a house
~ Where Mission Street bends
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What's that?
- It's a Helmut Lang suit.
- Helmut Lang suit. What for?
- That's for when we hit New York City.
A white suit for when
we hit New York City.
Cool.
You look like an angel.
~ Sorry
~ I can never love you tonight
~ I could never care enough
~ These last days
~ Her tears fell on her pages
~ Found me well on her words
~ I don't know what to do or say
I'm not ready to make love.
That's all right.
I'm just glad you're here.
So, thank you for coming in.
we do need you
to sign a few things.
OK. What are they?
- Just some papers finishing off your loan.
- OK.
What do you mean, finishing off my loan?
What do you mean?
Your loan's been paid off.
Just need you
to sign here and here.
And congratulations.
It must be quite a relief.
You are the sweetest man.
Oh, it's something
I'm able to do for you.
- You do a lot for me.
- I don't give you very much.
Financial things, yes,
but that's easy for me.
I know it's hard for you to be close.
Sorry.
- This you will love.
- That's nice.
There's one other... This one.
It's made with salmon roe.
It's fabulous. It's great.
Karen. It's Lisa.
Did you sell one of those
flowered print dresses this week? Size two.
Uh, yeah. Some guy came in.
Bought one for his girlfriend.
- What was the name on the credit card?
- OK. Hang on one second.
Ray Porter?
- Hello?
- Hi. It's Ray. I'm just about to land.
I'll be about a half-hour late.
Can I meet you at the gallery?
OK.
Excuse me, young lady?
Mirabelle.
It's me - Jeremy.
- Nice to see you again.
- Hi!
- You look so different.
- Yeah, I know.
Changes. Whoo!
D'you realize I've been on the road
for a very long time now?
- I guess you have, yeah.
- I've been trying to break into the moment.
That's been my work.
I don't get paid for it,
but it's my un-work work.
I feel unprepared to see you,
but it's so nice to see you again.
- Are you going to the Reynaldo Gallery?
- Yeah. Are you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm leaving tomorrow and I wasn't sure
if I'd see the show before it closes,
and I'm a huge fan of the artist.
He's a big influence on my stenciling.
Great.
- Two things.
- Yes?
- One:
- Uh-huh.
...you look great.
And second:
would you walk in there with me?
- Sure.
- Yeah.
- OK.
- Well, let's go. These are never clean.
- You look amazing!
- Well, you look amazing.
- Are you taller?
- I'm wearing heels.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He's younger than I thought.
Hm.
- Are you going in here alone?
- I'm meeting a friend.
- Cool. She's?
- He's.
He's.
- You want something from the bar?
- Not yet.
I'm gonna get something,
so I'll see you in a minute?
- OK. I'll just be walking around.
- OK. Bye, Mirabelle.
- Hi. Can I have a Mojito?
- Yes, sir.
Mojito.
For you, my good man.
Oh, my God.
I have never seen
anyone else order one of these.
Yeah, I just love the color.
Good. Funny.
- Yeah.
- wait.
You have to take the first sip
with your eyes closed, though. Like this.
Go ahead.
See? Nothing to distract you
from the first taste. How was it?
It's noisy.
I have a secret.
- What is it?
- I know who you are.
How do you know who I am?
You hear about people
who are worth hearing about.
I'm Lisa, Ray.
Hi, Lisa Ray.
Sense of humor.
That's good. That's good.
You, um...
Do you?
What is it?
- I can't, I can't, I'm sorry.
- What?
- What? Just tell me.
- I can't. I'm shy.
- Stop. I'm shy.
- OK. Do you want to get a drink later?
Yes.
Great. Um, when do you want to leave?
Now!
- You know what else I like?
- Hm?
- I think I like Ray Porter.
- Hm. I can't wait to meet him.
Bye! Hey.
- Arrive.
- Bonsoir.
- Sorry I'm late. want to take a walk?
- Sure.
- I've no car. Can you give me a ride?
- Yeah, mine's in the lot.
Hey, you want to go to the Ivy?
It's still early.

OK.
Are those handcuffs?
- Wait and find out.
- Whoa.
Oh, Ray.
Oh, Ray!
Oh, Ray!
Oh, Ray!
Oh, Ray! Oh, Ray!
- Well, we missed the Lakers.
- Do you care?
I wish I did. I'd be such a guy.
- I'm gonna get water.
- Let me get it.
- I'll get it. You want some?
- Yes.
- Sweetheart.
- What?
Nothing.
You want toast or toaster waffles?
- Toaster waffles.
- Toaster waffles.
- Hello?
- Oh. Did I wake you?
Hm?
- It's Jeremy.
- Who?
Sorry, speakerphone. It's Jeremy.
Mm. Who's Jeremy?
What do you mean, who's Jeremy?
Have we met?
Have we... It's Jeremy from last night,
you little devil. You're so funny.
Oh, you mean we met at the gallery?
I love it when you...
Yeah, we did all those...
Remember we were doing
all those oriental positions,
and you called me "big daddy. "
Oh! Ray!
Oh, Ray!
Oh, Ray! Oh, Ray!
Oh, Ray! Oh, Ray! Oh, Ray!
What?
You don't know who this is?
Yeah, this is Ray Porter from last night.
OK, who is Ray Porter?
Your waffle is burnt to perfection.
- Hey, guess what?
- What?
When I'm in New York next week,
I decided to look for an apartment.
- To move there?
- Just a place to stay while I'm there.
No more luggage! Whoo-hoo!
Like a crash pad. You lucky mister.
Actually, I'll look for a three-bedroom
in case I meet someone and have kids.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
Ray...
why don't you love me?
Are you just biding your time with me?
I thought you understood.
So...
I can either hurt now or hurt later.
Now, I guess.
~ I stand there watching you
~ Hand holds a cigarette
~ She tells me her name
~ And once again I will forget
~ 'Cause somewhere in my heart...
Goodbye, Mirabelle. And good luck.
~ Somewhere in my dreams
~ Is a love that won't stop me
~ She drinks her coffee twice
~ Said something I cannot hear
~ Dark hair and brown eyes
~ Speak that I have found what might be
~ Somewhere in my heart
~ There's a love that always will be
~ Somewhere in my dreams
~ There's a love that won't stop me
~ wish I could want someone
~ Long enough to feel this way
~ Can't make up your mind
~ But it feels worse this time
~ 'Cause somewhere in my heart
~ Is a love that always will be
~ Somewhere in my dreams
~ Is a love that won't stop
So, could I borrow, like, two bucks?
I'm just kidding.
Here.
Here's one of my lucky rubber bands.
- For a rainy day.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
- Of course.
OK.
I've been reading a lot of books on tape
about getting into the moment,
and I think this is the moment.
And in the moment, this moment, I...
I think we should kiss.
And, um...
I've stood right here before and I've been
hurt, I have been rejected by you,
and I'm going to ask you
to kiss me again.
And, um... And...
Will you just kiss me?
Thank you.
- Jeremy.
- Mm?
So what made you do all this?
- All this what?
- All this... success.
Well, you did.
- I did?
- Mm-hm.
How?
Well, you said, "Just do it. "
So I did it.
That's not very much.
Yeah, but...
I'll protect you.
I will.
Some nights alone.
He thinks of her.
And some nights alone.
She thinks of him.
Some nights these thoughts
occur at the same moment.
And Ray and Mirabelle are connected
without ever knowing it.
But Mirabelle. Now feeling
the warmth of her first reciprocal love.
Has broken away from him.
And as Jeremy
offers her more of his heart.
Mirabelle offers
equal parts of herself in return.
One night.
Sooner than she would have liked.
which made it irresistible.
They make love
for the second time in 14 months.
At this point. Jeremy surpasses
Ray Porter as a lover of Mirabelle.
Because what he offers her
is tender and true.
So, tonight we'll go for Indian food.
- I want one of those burrito...
- Yeah. A d-d-d...
- A doobie.
- Doobie?
A dobio? What is it called?
Um, I'm just gonna go talk to my friend.
I'll be back in a second.
OK.
My girlfriend did these.
- Did you get my birthday present?
- I did, yeah.
- Did you get my thank-you note?
- Oh.
Yes, yes. I'm sorry. Thank you.
It's OK.
- You look nice.
- Thank you.
Are you happy?
I am.
- The lower intensity is nice.
- Yeah.
- Who's your girlfriend?
- She's a doctor.
Ah. A hypochondriac no more.
She'll check you out.
Well, she's a gynecologist.
Then you'll have a lot to discuss.
- Are you happy?
- Yeah.
You know, I'm always a little edgy.
Restless.
That's a good word.
I want you to have
the drawing of me sleeping.
- It's in the gallery.
- You don't have to do that.
No, I want you to have it.
I made it while
we were seeing each other.
Thank you.
And, um...
Just so you know,
I'm sorry for the way I treated you.
I know.
I did love you.
Goodbye.
As Ray Porter watches
Mirabelle walk away.
He feels a loss.
How is it possible. He thinks.
To miss a woman whom he kept at a distance.
So that when she was gone
he would not miss her?
Only then does he realize how wanting
part of her. And not all of her.
Had hurt them both.
And how he cannot justify his actions
except that... well...
it was life.
