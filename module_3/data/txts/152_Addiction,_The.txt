I see your vision in the darkness every time I close my eyes
I can feel the heat from your body it won't let me it won't let me sleep at night
I hear you whisper slow nice things
You're my addiction
I can't face the new day baby
until I receive your kiss
sunlight becomes my enemy
don't want my friends to see me like this
I need more and more
you're the sickness then the cure
you're my addiction
yes you are
It's the loneliness that keeps you
coming back again and again
The habit you know that is killing you it becomes your only friend
but you make me feel more alive then I've ever been
You're my sanctuary
Baby let me in, you're my addiction
Addiction
You're a shelter from the storm
You're my addiction
When I don't have a friend
You're a face without a name baby
It began in the early morning.
The American soldiers were under orders to
search and destroy enemy positions
They came upon the village at dawn.
What they did in that place later shocked the world.
The adminstration sensitive to world opinion
brought to trial the men responsible
and found them guilty. Justice though blind was served.
The conscience of a outraged society
was temporarily satisfied.

The whole country they were all guilty.
How can you single out one man?
You can't jail a whole country. You know.
They needed a scapegoat.
He was the unlucky one that got caught.
I don't think luck had anything to do with it.
I mean, how did he get over there?
Who put the gun in his hand?
They say he was guilty of killing women and babies.
How many bombs where dropped
that did the exact same thing?
How many homes were destroyed?
Who's in jail for that?
What do you want me to say? The systems not perfect.
You know. People just wanted
to show that their disgust by what was happening.
and justifiably so, I mean..
I'm not saying it wasn't justifiable
I'm only saying that,
if you're going to prosecute war crimes
you better make sure that more than one man takes the blame
for everything, that's ridiculous
So where are you going?
I gotta meet my brother. Okay, I'm gonna go this way, see you later.
yeah
Nice night, yes
Look at me
and tell me to go away.
Don't ask tell me!
Please
Please don't hurt me
You think that's gonna stop me?
But please
Fuckin' good
Collaborater
You wanna know what's gonna happen?
Just wait and see...
Okay lady, you left a description of the perp
after they sanitized the area.
If you see her again on the street just call 911.
if we happen to pick her up
Your're gonna have to come into the station house
to view a line-up.
Your're lucky she didn't cut your throat!
Oh my God
Aah Fuck
Yeah
One aspect of determinism
is manifested in the fact that the unsaved
don't recognize the sin in their lives.
Their unconscious of it.
They don't suffer pangs of conscience because
they don't recognize evil exists.
This is because their all pre-destined to hell
and therefore never brought to the light of metanoia
or conversion.
Which is a work of grace only in a believers life.
so when considering the salvatory aspect of facing guilt
suffering is a good thing
we should all hope to feel guilty
to feel pain and seek pardon
and ultimately freedom.
Guilt is a sign that God is working out your destiny
and it's a foolish person who refuses to acknowledge this.
Now in the case of the institutions,
if you look on page 36
Katherine, If we look on page 36
Hi Kathy, I'm your attending physician.
How do you feel? Well the test
do not indicate anything to serious and the
wound shows absolutely no infection.
The AIDS virus couldn't manifest itself so
quickly. If you're curious about?
What we really think is going on is that,
you probably have some chronic anemia
which has been exacerbated by
traumaticevent. We're just gonna keep
you here for a few days.
build you up with fluids and iron should
be on your way in no time.
Any question?
and if you need help in the mean time, just
ring for the nurse okay.
Hi where have you been?
In the infirmary, I haven't been feeling well.
You're not kidding you don't look so good.
Did they give you something for it?
Medicine is just an extended metaphor for
omnipotence. They gave me antibiotics.
So why aren't you taking them?
What are you looking at?  Huh, i didn't
mean to stare.
You all right? Yeah
Did you read the assignment for the
Cassidy seminar? Ya did you go through it?
through it?
They're all liars. Let them rot with
cancer. We'll see what they have to say about free will.
about free will. How can you eat and read
that stuff at the same time? What is with you?
You have to question the sanity of
bothering to a dissertation on these idiots.
Well it was either this or an EDD
it was are only other option.
Have you seen the exhibit? No. You wanna go?
Yeah, I'll meet you after class. Okay.
This is what the German's believed
let there be know mistake about it. Did deliberately
and slowly the doctors, authors, lawyers,
musicians, to professional people of every kind.
I know clearly one half the truth that
and that is one half more than they recognize.
The old adage from santiana
That those who don't learn from history
are doomed to repeat is a lie.
There is no history. Everything we are
is eternally with us.
Our question is therefore. What can save
us from our crazy insistence of
of spreading the blight never widening
circles.
Being nothingness, Being in time ideas
sickness unto death Kirkegaard will to
power Nietzsche for next week I want you

questions? Okay class dismissed.
I heard you weren't feeling well. Are you
all right now? Yes
Thanks. You still want to meet at 7:00?
Yes you can bring whatever you've done
so far. Okay maybe we can grab something to eat
eat while we're at it? That's fine
You sure you're up to it? Yeah
It makes no difference what I do. Whether
I draw blood or not. It's the violence of
my will against theirs.
Is there something wrong? You haven't said a
word all night long.
Silence has two aspects one according
Sartre,the other to Max Picard why don't
you guess why I'm quiet. To amuse you?
What is it? Did I say something to upset you?
You're to egotistical professor.
True, but what is it what you are?
Uhm
Look it's getting late, we ought to get work.
Some things are more important than others.
Besides aren't you the one
who excuse speculative philosophy
I've come to terms with my existence. Applying what
I've learned my own being.
Will get to the thesis in good time.
Such sad music, isn't it?
It's making me depressed.
Let's go.
Listen. I think I'd better go home.
It hasn't been the most enjoyable
evening you know. Ssh, come up.
So you want something to drink?

Anthropology. Hmm do you like it?
What else is there? Man is the measure of all things.
Protagoras. Right?

Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy.
Are you ever afraid to walk these streets?
Yeah always.
What choice do we have? It's that or

Not that would make me happy. I like it here.
Do you live in the dorms? Yeah you?
My own apartment. You want to come over? I'm
going straight through till morning. We
can have some coverage. Our we gonna
talk more about Feuerbach? Sure. I'll come over.
What the hell were you thinking?
Why didn't you just tell me to go? Why didn't you
say get lost? Like you really meant it.
I was afraid you'd hurt me. Worse than I've done?
I don't even no what you've done. I don't even no what the hell this is.
I'm I gonna get sick now? No.
No worse than you were before.
What is that suppose to mean?
How can you act so glibly?
Look what you've done to me.
How can you do this? Doesn't this affect you at all?
No. It was your decision.
Your friend Feuerbach wrote: that all men
counting stars are equivalent in every
way to God. My indifference is not the
concern here.
It's your astonishment the need study.
Where were you? I was calling you all last night.
Ah, in the library. Uh
Maybe you should slow down Kat. I don't know if you'd seen what you

Oh jeez! Come on
I need to talk to you Jean.
You're welcome for the flowers. Come on.
Come on i wanna talk to you. okay, alright. Please let's talk.
I met a guy he's a vet and I spent a couple of night with him.
Since when do you smoke?
You know what he does all day?
He kills cows, he works on slaughterhouse.
in blood up to his ankles. I asked him
how come? He says a career after
4 years at preparation at Princeton
couldn't compete what they taught him in
Southeast Asia. At night he just rides
around in his meat truck he picks up hitchhikers
and take some wherever they want to go.
You're halfway through your
dissertation. You don't go to class
you don't study, you don't conference
I don't know what the hell you're doing?
Every philosopher had a predecessor
without whom his system of philosophy
could have never developed. The same
could be said for all of us but you see
it's all failed. Because our predecessor
doesn't have a name. Predecessor to what?
I don't know what you're talking about?
Gilt doesn't pass with time, Jean. It's
eternal.
Yeah. The appetites insatiable that's
what I've learned the past couple weeks.
You're not gonna try to deny that are you?
At least show me you've learned that to.
Show you what? You want an apology for
ethical relativis or something? No
Prove there's no evil and you can go.
What do you mean I can go? The mayor's at my
house I had to cover them up why do you
think that is? huh what is? What is it in my face
that I don't want to look at?
Kathy starting to scare me now. you know that?
It's these eyes it's the eyes. Eventually
everyone does the same.
Kathy you want my advice? You should get to
the infirmary. You think he'll shuts
down after a couple years? You think what you've
done isn't floating around
somewhere in space? What makes you think
been forgiven for lying to your
motheras a child huh?
or for haven slept with married men and
adultery or paying taxes that turned
Central America into a mud puddle huh
What does...Here come here
I want to take you to the girls room. All right?
Come here I wanna show you something.
Come here
What are you afraid of ? You wanna see something?
Jesus! I'm rotting inside but I'm not
dying. I could go on like this for ever.
Kathy now come on we're all golden
to the dead. Most of us go for plastic
surgery to hide the blemishes. She can't
cover the disease that originates. I don't even who you're talking too?
Kathy you gotta get some help.
Yah know it's to disheartening
especially in a doctoral candidate
yah outta know better.
I ought to know what better? You're
acting like a lunatic.
Sure it's easy to spout people like me
the cancers grown obvious but you're
as terminal as I am. You know that? You're as
addicted as I am. It's the nature of the
organism. Is that what this is about?
yeah that's it
Now look me in the face
Tell me go.
Look sin in the face
and tell it to go. Kathy
Please
That's what it does to you. You look me in the face
and tell me to go. You're hurting me
You kidding me. I'll crush you like God
What do you want from me? Look me in
the face tell me to go like you mean it.
Kathy, please, say it with authority now.
Let go! say it with authority.
Let Go! How you gonna see yourself after tonight
please stop it! please stop it! please let go of me!
Kathy KATHY!
Because if you say that to me then I'll do anything to take it back.
Of course, of course...
...but why you can't enjoy it....
...it's all gone...
...then the proper things...
huh
Why don't you just tell me leave me you alone?
Like you mean it.
Harder
You want to go someplace dark?
Mmm, your breath smells like shit. Know that?
You know how long I've been fasting?
40 years. The last time I shot up I had a
dozen to happen one night. They fall like
flies before the hunger, don't they?
You can never get enough. Can yah? But you
learn to control it, you learn like the
Tibetans to survive on a little.  Yah Know.
So what you've been doing? What do you
have inside. Any kids? Blood of any children?
First ones the hardest isn't it?
After that they're like all the rest.
Well, here we are.
The entire world's a graveyard
and we the birds of prey picking at the
bones.
I saw, we're the ones who let the dying
know the hour has come. Sit
You think Nietzsche understood something?
Mankind has striven to exist beyond good
and evil from he beginning.
You know what they found? You want tea?
No. Maybe later. How can you drink it?
Alot of people drink tea.
I mean people like us. I'm not like you
you're nothing.
There's something you ought not to forget
you're not a person
you're nothing.
Have you read Naked Lunch? Burrows
perfectly describes what it's like to go
without a fix. Who are you?
My name is Peina. What do you want for me?
No!
What do you want from me? You came after
me you took my hand you tried to force
me somehow isn't that how it went? You
think you understand things. You know
NOTHING! You understand Nothing! I'll show
you what you are.
I'll teach what hunger is.
You thought the first time was difficult.
Relax it's a long time till sunrise.
You can't eat, you can't sleep, you can't
even go out to satisfy the urge during
the day you are slave to what you are
and you're nothing. I defecate when's the
last time you did that?
I'm almost human I eat I sleep I have a
job, I can diet it took a long time.
You think you know what we are. The point is to
blend in. Not to stand out like sore
thumb. It's quality existence.
My habit is controlled by my will. True
my will initially formed by my addiction.
But now strong enough to dictate the
conditions of fulfilling my needs.
Then abstract whatever good is in you
I will use, for my sustenance and for you
you'll feel as though you haven't
eaten in weeks.
Demons suffer in hell.
Oh
yeah
ah oh
ah
Oh
Oh
You can't kill what's dead. What?
Eternitys is a long time get used to it.
Please help, help me. What are you worried about
you're not gonna die.
Pain, pain is something else, pain is something
we all know but takes a special person
to see pain. Please help me. Not that
person believe me.
What's gonna happen to me? Read the books Sartre Beckett
Who do you think they're talking about?
You think they're works of fiction?
I felt the wind of the wings of madness
Baudelaire. I'll be back late. What? Be honest
you were not trying to end it all
just now. You were just trying to see if I left
anything you could eat?
Anything for a fix!
Please
Please, please
Come on
Please help me
Please
Oh fuck
Hey, Lady you alright? You okay? come on let me
get you up sweetie. You all right? Huh
Come on let me get you up, come on, come on
Let me get you, come on St. Francis is
right over here.
I finally understand what all this is
how it was all possible now I see. Good
lord how we must look from out there our
addiction is evil. The propensity for
this evil lies in our weakness before it.
Kierkegaard was right. There is an awful
precipice before us. But he was wrong
about the leap. There's a difference
between jumping and being pushed.
You reach a point where you are forced to
face your own needs. And the fact you
can't terminate the situation settles on
you with full force.
It's not cogito ergo sum
but de dita ergo sum
beco ergo sum
the intrusion of values
Philosophy is propaganda.
There is always an attempt to influence
the object to change it's view of things.
The real question is what is the
philosophers impact on other egos
transcendent or otherwise. Does that lie within
the grammar of your thesis?
If we eliminate the verb we eliminate meaning.
The predicate defines the nouns role in
being. That's why my analysis insisted on
a discernible didacticism in the works
of the philosopher. It belies his
transcendence his independence, and the result.
Essence is revealed through praxis
the philosophers words his ideas
his actions cannot be separated from his value.
His meaning that's what it's all about.
Isn't it? Our impact on other egos.
Dean, Congratulation! Thank you. Doctor all the best.
I'd like to invite you
faculty and friends to a small
get together I'm having after the reception.
Okay I would be honored
and I will be there you can bet on it.
Please be there. I will.
Thank you. Bye
Hi! Okay Okay See you there
There is a dual nature to the addiction.
It satisfies the hunger which evil engenders.
But it also dulls our perception
so we are helped to forget how ill
we really are. We drink to escape the fact
we're alcoholics. Existence is the search for
relief from our habit and
our habit is the only relief we can find.
Good evening sister, how are you doing?
Here the good news God loves yous.
God loves you.
Hear the word of God brother, we give free
lunches at our Center every day it's on 35th Street
the addresses is there. God loves you. Please come in side.
No I can't thank you.
I appreciate the offer, maybe another time.
 God bless you.
Hear the word of God the good news God loves you brother
I can't! What?!
Why not?! Uh! Fuckin Why Not?!?! No I will not!
I will not submit!
I will not! I will Not SUBMIT! No!
NO! NO!

Have you seen Kathy? Not all night. Okay.
Kathy
Get me a women. You make sure I fit into her things. Now.
Hi, Hi Good... Just need some help...great thanks
...it's do to lack of enrollment I believe...
Everybody I would like to thank you all for coming
here tonight to help me celebrate
the ? on my degree. I would
like to acknowledge a sincere debt of gratitude
to the faculty and to the School.
All right!
and I'd like to share a little bit of what I've learned
Through these long hard years
of study.
Ha Ha Ha
somebody call 911
Get some rest you're gonna be all right.
Nobody's gonna let you die.
Pick it up 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 Pick it up 1,2,3 My Fair Lady
Pick it up 1,2,3, 1,2,3 1,2,3 Pick it up 1,2,3 My Fair Lady HeeHe
hmm-what? The blinds. You want me to open them?
Are you sure?
Seven Circle Huh?
Dante described it perfectly
bleeding trees waiting for judgement day where
we can all hang ourselves from our own
branches. It's not that easy doctor.
To find rest takes a real genius.
It's all a matter of discernment.
Now R.C. Sproul said we're not sinners
because we sin but we sin because we are
sinners.
In more accessible terms
we're not evil because of the evil we do
but we do evil because we are evil.
Yeah
Now what choices do such people have? It's not
not like we have any options.
Hi doctor how are ya?
Nice to see you haven't seen you lately
how have you been, Good to see you.
Good morning.
How do you feel? Can I get you something?
I want to make a confession.
Are you a Catholic?
I was baptized
What would you like to confess?
God
forgive me.
Oh mighty God have mercy on you
forgive you all your sins through our
Lord Jesus Christ strengthen you in all goodness
and by the power of the Holy Spirit
keep you in eternal life.
The body of Christ.
Amen.
To face what we are in the end .
We stand before the light and our true nature is
revealed. Self revelation is anihilation
of self.
