lt's time for Doctor Wolfenstein's
Creature Feature Show.
The doctor is in!
Don't scream. Don't move!
Stay tuned on Channel 68's
Halloween Eve movie marathon.
l'm your host,
your ghost host with the most,
Dr. Wolfenstein.
l will be with you until the end.
Howdy, folks!
You like blood, violence,
and freaks of nature?
Well, then, come on down
to Captain Spaulding's
Museum of Monsters and Madmen.
Yeah, see the Alligator Boy.
Ride my famous Murder Ride.
Most of all, don't forget to take home
some of my tasty fried chicken.
ltjust tastes so damn good.
...decapitated with a meat cleaver.
See it, hear it, and actually feel it.
Coming after you to rip your flesh apart.
Unbelievable but true.
See it, hear it, and actually feel it.
Fresh meat.
Shit. l can't do nothing with this now.
l can't get rid of this.
lt ain't worth nothing. My name's all over it.
l was fixing to trade it to Jackie Cobb.
That retard that hangs out
at Molly's Fruit Stand?
-Yeah.
-You know, for the life of me,
l cannot understand
why you hang out with that asshole.
He's one horny retard.
Well, hell, ain't they all?
All they want to do is eat and fuck.
Well, if you knew him,
you might understand his urges.
Worse than a rabid-ass baboon.
Yeah. You know what his favorite thing is
next to whacking his weasel?
He takes a sharpened pencil
and sticks it in his eyeball and twists it.
-What?
-He doesn't hurt himself, though.
He kind of twists it right next to his eyeball.
He's been putting that pencil
someplace other than his eyeball.
Nah, he don't do nothing like that.
Although, once, he got caught,
you know, with a Planet ofthe Apes doll
stuck up his asshole.
Goddamn!
Yeah, they had to take him to the hospital.
Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck halfway up his butt.
Couldn't get it out.
See it, hear it, and actually feel it.
Coming after you to rip your flesh apart.
Did you fix the toilet yet?
Yes, l did,
and l don't want you stuffing
any goddamn paper towels down there.
l had to snake the shit out that thing.
Here you go.
Now, you bust that crapper,
l'm gonna bust your ass.
l hear you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Hairy fucking Moses!
Y'all get the fuck out of here!
Cool it, clowny!
Keep your paws where l can see them!
Yeah, don't move!
Or l'll blast a hole
the size of a Kansas City watermelon
through your ugly-ass bozo-face!
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Go grab that other asshole
out of the shitter
and drag his ass back in here.
Right.
You miserable motherfuck...
l ought to jump over this counter
and bash your fucking balls in!
All right, Pippi, hand over the cash box,
and l might
leave your brains inside your skull.
Well, l'll tell you what, Ski King.
Why don't you just take
your Mama home some chicken,
and then l won't have to stuff my boot
all up in your ass.
l don't like chicken. And l hate clowns!
Let's see, l get it all? l got all this...
-Put that shit down!
-All right!
Put it down! Fuck!
That is it!
l'm gonna count to 1 0,
and you're gonna hand over all the cash,
or l'm gonna splatter your greasepaint mug
across the state line.
-One!
-Fuck your mama!
-Two!
-Fuck your sister!
What are we gonna do?
Hey, l know you.
You work at the hardware store, right?
-Richard Wick, right?
-Shut your trap!
Quiet down! Both of you!
-Three!
-Fuck your grandma!
Hey, l remember now.
All the guys made fun of you,
called you "Little Dick" Wick.
Shut up!
Stop singing! l hate that song!
Get your fucking mask back on!
Oh, fuck it!
Most of all, fuck you!
Goddamn motherfucker
got blood all over my best clown suit!
How many want a touch this afternoon?
Raise your hand
if you want God to touch you.
l'm gonna pray that God
will give you a divine touch...
The U.S. Department of Agriculture
is checking whether state
meat and poultry inspectors
are good enough to allow the product
to go on sale nationally.
The USDA has said...
Man, some of these Manson chicks
are really hot.
Shit! How are we almost out of gas?
Look, and this Squeaky. Right here.
That's a girl you would date.
Jerry, how much did you put in?
l don't know. Two, three bucks.
Two, three bucks?
l told you to fill the tank!
Bill, feel me. Am l made of money? Get off.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Don't panic yourself there,
way-too-much-caffeine-guy.
You know, l wouldn't be drinking
so much coffee
if you did your share of the driving.
-You know l don't have night vision.
-Not this again.
Seriously, l can't even make out the lines
on the road.
-Oh, please.
-Fine, Bill. You know what?
You want to pull the car over?
l'd be more than happy to kill us out here
in the middle of nowhere.
Look, besides,
there's a billboard, right there.
"Captain Spaulding's
Museum of Monsters and Madmen."
Oh, that sounds great!
"Fried chicken and gasoline."
Next exit. There you go. Problem solved.
And we didn't have to freak out.
No big deal, Bill.
Dick.
All right, l'll pump the gas.
Go inside and see
if it's worth checking out.
Okay, Mr. Cranky.
Holy crap! You gotta see this place!
lt's boss.
-Yeah, how boss?
-Really fucking boss.
Like wake up the chicks
and break out the camera boss?
Hell, yeah.
Wakey-wakey! Eggs and bacon!
Hey, sweetie, come on.
Grab Mary and get your stuff
and come on inside.
Bill and l found a kick-ass place.
Come on, move, move!
Let's go.
Come on, Sleeping Beauty.
lt's time to go to work.
What's in that case over there?
Hairless monkey.
Did you see the Crocodile Boy?
How'd you like to find that in your pants?
Excuse me, sir?
-Howdy.
-Hi.
l love this place.
How long you been running this place?
Well...
How long's a piece of string?
l don't know.
Too goddamn long, that's how long.
Too goddamn long. That's right.
l hear that. But how long, actually?
Oh, shit, l don't know exactly.
l took over from my pa
right after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
You mean John Wayne.
Hell, son, how many Dukes
do you know about?
Greatest American ever lived. Look at that!
Circle up the wagons, Pilgrims.
Whatever you say, Cowboy.
Yeah, l'm not that much of a Western fan.
l like science fiction.
Space boy.
Yeah, well, l figured as much.
Let me ask you something.
How come you asking
so many jackassy questions?
You see, my friends and l,
we're driving across country.
We're writing this book, actually,
on offbeat roadside attractions.
You know, the crazy shit you see
when you're driving across the country.
l don't drive across country.
But if you did?
But l don't.
Yeah, but just supposing
for a second that you did...
You little dickens, you.
-l know what your problem is.
-What's that?
Y'all think us folks from the country
grew up funny-like, don't you?
-Jerry!
-Yeah, we'll saddle up the mule, Ma!
Slide me some grits!
l's got to get me some education.
-Jerry!
-You asshole!
No, no, l really am very interested.
l'm not trying to make fun.
Got you!
You are such a bad clown.
Oh, fuck these sights!
Who the hell would want to read
about all this horseshit, anyway?
You'd be surprised.
Son, look around.
Would l be surprised?
Oh, finally! Great, great, come on!
We paid for the tickets.
-Let's go, let's go, let's go!
-What tickets?
This isn't everything.
There is actually a Murder Ride.
A Murder Ride?
l don't want to go on a Murder Ride.
-Yes, you do want to go on a Murder Ride.
-No, l don't.
Hey, how about if we skip the Murder Ride?
Hey, how about if we go?
Anytime this year, people.
The tour is about to begin.
Okay, we'll see you inside the Murder Ride.
We'll be back! Bye!
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
children of all ages.
You are about to enter a world of darkness,
a world where
life and death are meaningless
and pain is god.
-Hey!
-Ravelli, let's go!
Yeah! Murder Ride!
-Plant your ass, boy!
-Sorry, Captain Spaulding.
Yeah, we're gonna have a good time now.
On your right,
you will see the infamous Albert Fish!
Masochist, sadist, child killer
and most importantly...cannibal.
Fish, born 1 870,
enjoyed spankings
with nail-studded paddles,
stuck needles deep into his groin.
l have a question. How many nails...
Hold all questions.
Help! Help! Help!
Lizzie fucking Borden!
Now, one of our most famous crazies,
the psycho of Plainfield, Mr. Ed Gein.
Murderer, cannibal.
Mr. Gein used to take great pleasure
in playing with the dead bodies of women.
Especially the sexual organs.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Why? Why? Why?
Now, one of our local heroes,
S. Quentin Quale, a.k.a. Dr. Satan.
Holy shit!
Murderer, torturer, but most of all,
master surgeon.
Mr. Quale was an intern
at the Willows County Mental Hospital,
nicknamed Weeping Willows
for the never-ending cries of pain.
Through primitive brain surgery...
Jerry, stop it!
...Mr. Quale believed that he could create
a race of superhumans
from the mentally ill.
Vigilante justice prevailed.
They took his ass out and hung him.
And that infamous hanging tree
is no more than a stone's throw away
from where y'all's ass is now seated.
But the next day
his body was found to be missing.
Until today no trace of Dr. Satan
has ever been discovered.
But then, who knows?
Maybe he lives next door to you.
Tour's over. Exit through the doors.
That was so bad-ass!
Dr. Satan! Dr. Satan!
Maybe he lives next door to you!
Calm down. lt was all right.
Yeah, do you think
maybe we could go now?
Look, l'm gonna go call my dad, all right.
l'll be right back.
l love you.
What do you mean, "lt was all right"?
l mean, it was cool, but it wasn't that great.
Dude, you don't have to play it down
in front of your chick.
Thank you.
Don't move a muscle, an artery or a vein.
-Hello.
-Hey, Dad.
Denise!
We stopped for gas
at this place called Captain Spaulding's,
somewhere outside of Ruggsville, and...
lt turned into this whole big thing,
so we're kind of behind schedule.
Well, don't be too late.
Oh, l forgot to tell you
that Halloween falls on a school night
so they're trick-or-treating tonight.
Your left hand shows your past.
Your right hand shows your future.
Good evening. l'm Lance Brockwell,
and this is the 7 O'clock News.
And our top story tonight.
lnvestigators still have no leads
in the strange disappearance
of the five cheerleaders
from Ruggsville High School.
Cindy Thompson, Karen Murphy,
Allison Cole, Valerie Green,
and Dawn Baker
were last seen four days ago
leaving a football game...
l know it seems stupid,
but l really want to see this tree.
Do yourself a favor, son.
Just forget about it.
Oh, come on! l live for this shit.
-Okay, all right, l'll draw you a damn map.
-Thank you.
-l still say it's a waste of time.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, you are here.
Go straight up this road.
Make the first right, first left.
Come straight across and down.
You can't find it, tough.
-Here's your map.
-Right on.
-Here's your complimentary chicken.
-Oh, wow!
Don't let the door hit you in the ass
on the way out.
-You're gonna get a great write-up for this.
-Yeah!
Here's an idea. Let's just skip it.
lt's probably nothing, anyway.
Yeah, l mean, Christ, Jerry. Bill is right.
We can't see anything.
What's that?
Hitchhiker.
-What, should we stop?
-We can't leave her out here in the rain.
Stick her in the front
if you want to pick her up so bad.
So, where you headed?
-l was just going home.
-Home? Where's that?
Couple more miles up the road.
-So you live around here?
-Yeah.
Hey, do you know where
this Dr. Satan tree is at?
Yeah, l know where that's at.
-lt's right by my house. l can show you.
-Really? So it is a real thing.
So, the tree, what's that?
-What tree?
-Okay, this is crazy.
-She obviously doesn't know anything.
-Oh, l know. l'll show you where it's at.
Whatever you need to do, you do it.
There is no wrong.
lf someone needs to be killed,
you kill them.
That's the way.
Fuck! Oh, fuck!
-What's the problem, partner?
-Fucking tire.
Oh, poop.
Hell.
At least we got that spare.
-You filled it up like l asked, right?
-Yeah, yeah.
Okay, now, what if l forgot
to put it back in the trunk?
What would Plan "B" entail?
Jesus Christ, Jerry!
Well, technically, l did what you said!
Oh, for fucking sake, Jerry,
what are we gonna do now?
l can't rightly say if l know, me ladies.
Oh, great! l love that song!
Will you turn the radio off, please?
God!
-We could walk to my house from here.
-What?
Yeah, my brother's got a tow truck.
He can come get your car.
l'll go. lt's my fault.
-Forget it. l'm going.
-No, Bill...
You guys just stay here.
There's no sense
in everyone getting drenched.
l completely agree.
Turning to the news.
Local authorities still have no leads
in the mysterious disappearance
of the five cheerleaders from Ruggsville.
The girls were last seen
leaving a cheering competition...
That was loud enough to wake the dead.
-That's an idea.
-What is?
Wouldn't it be dramatic?
Supposing the people inside were dead,
all stretched out
with the lights quietly burning about them.
l'm sure it would be very amusing.
Why, you ask?
Why is not the question.
How?
Well, that is a question worth examining.
How could l,
being born of such conventional stock,
arrive a leader of the rebellion?
An escapist from a conformist world
destined to find happiness
only in that which cannot be explained.
l've brought you here for a reason.
But unfortunately,
you and your sentimental minds
are doing me no good!
My brain is frozen.
Locked!
l have to break free from this culture
of mechanical reproductions
and the thick encrustations
dying on the surface.
Oh, Christ.
Fuck it.
These are all my dolls.
l used to, like, chop their heads off
and their arms
and stick them up on the wall.
The door's locked. l gotta go around.
Just wait here.
Christ! God! Oh, don't do that!
You scared the shit out of me!
You ain't seen nothing yet.
ls your brother ready to go?
Oh, yeah, he already left. Come on inside.
He left?
Yeah! Come in and get toasty.
-Don't worry about it. He's fine.
-l just don't understand why...
What was that?
What? l didn't hear anything.
Turn the radio off.
Now listen.
-l still don't hear anything.
-l swear to God l heard like some weird...
Turn on the headlights.
See if something's out there.
Calm down! Calm down!
Jesus H. Christ.
lt's the fucking tow-truck guy.
We've come to ask for shelter.
We've lost our way.
We're absolutely cut off.
Don't you understand?
We can't go forward, and we can't go back.
So, you live alone here,
l mean, just you and your brother?
Nah, there's a bunch of us
around somewhere.
l think Otis is upstairs
messing around or something.
You gotta have the marshmallows.
That's what makes it fun.
Yeah, l guess.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
Wow. Look at him.
He must have been going pretty fast
to smash through that wall.
You sure are silly for a guy with glasses.
l like that.
Okay, hey! Need those to see. Thank you.
-All right.
-How do l look?
Terrific, really. Great.
Tasty.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.
Okay.
Okay, well. l wonder what time...
-Yeah, it's getting kind of late, huh?
-Don't worry, sugar.
lt ain't past my bedtime.
Hey, are you flirting with me?
What? Oh. No.
Hey, great. They're back.
Whoopee-fucking-do.
Excuse me.
Look, l gotta call my dad
and tell him we're gonna be late.
Can l use your phone, please?
-Hello?
-Ain't got one.
-Oh, hi.
-Oh, my goodness.
You really don't have a phone?
No.
l once had one back in '57, but...
l don't quite remember.
See, there's nobody around here
l feel like jaw-flapping at no more.
Say, do you think
maybe the guy with the tow truck
could drive us to a phone?
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr.,
but we all call him R.J.
Makes sense.
What do they call you, sweetie?
l am Qualznarg of the Crab Nebula.
But you humans can call me Jerry.
Jerry.
Baby, go and see how R.J. is doing
with these nice folks' automobile.
Meanwhile, why don't
you just all make yourselves to home?
Well, what brings you kids way out here?
Haven't you got
something better to do on Halloween
than wander around out in the sticks?
l thought maybe we'd take in a hoedown.
No, he's... He's just joking.
-You are?
-l'm sorry. l'm just messing with you.
l'm sorry.
Shut up, dude.
Oh, l get it.
You all just think you're too good
for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
No, just a little too old.
Oh, really? Well, l hope
something changes your mind someday.
Mama, Tiny's home.
Well, what about R.J.?
He was gone before l seen him.
But Tiny saw him and said he said he was
going down to the yard to get a new wheel.
How long is that gonna take?
-Probably be back in couple hours.
-A couple of hours?
-Mary.
-What?
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Oh, Tiny ain't got no car.
He ain't even got a bicycle.
Well, even though l know
that you think it is childish,
tonight is Halloween Eve,
and to us, it is special.
So you are all invited to dinner.
l hope to Christ
she don't expect us to wear these things.
Whatever it is, just do it.
The more we play along,
the faster we get the hell out of here.
Now is not the time to make waves. Jerry.
You'll have to forgive Tiny.
He can't hear so much.
My poor baby.
lt's his daddy's fault.
Oh, l mean, Earl wasn't a bad man.
He never hit me or nothing like that.
One day, he just up
and went devil on us all.
What happened?
Well, he tried to burn down the house.
He said it was possessed by the spirits,
and Tiny was sleeping in
the basement room where the fire started.
But l don't think Earl
ever meant to harm us.
But Tiny was badly burnt.
His ears were destroyed
and most of his skin.
-ls that why he wears the mask?
-Yeah.
My baby boy gets shy around new people.
But he'll warm up to you,
especially the girls.
He's a real lady-killer.
You're gonna miss a good show tonight,
but that's your tough luck.
l thought you kids
were all about team spirit.
l mean, you ain't done fuck-all
to cheer me up since you got here.
Give me a "B."
Give me an "A."
Give me a "B."
Give me a "Y."
What's that spell?
Baby?
You're damn right.
Okay, now. Everybody put on your masks.
We can't very well eat our desserts
with our everyday faces exposed, can we?
Gosh, kid, put it on.
Look, she ain't gonna let
any of us touch dessert
unless you're wearing this damn thing.
Mrs. Firefly?
Do you know anything
about the legend of Dr. Satan?
-Oh, here we go.
-Shut up.
Well, l'm not one for gossip,
l must admit, but l have...
l know all about
what you want to know all about.
Otis.
l can't believe you decided
to come down and join us.
And you brought Little Wolf.
Oh, my baby.
Oh, my God.
Such a special night for me.
Now, l don't know who told you
your fairy fables about Dr. Satan.
We heard it from Captain Spaulding
up the road.
That old bitch-hog don't know shit.
He tells his cute, little tattletales
to sell his junk.
He don't sell no Yankee boys no truth.
Yeah, but, l mean,
something happened, right?
l mean, it had to be based
on some real incident.
What are you, Jimmy Olsen,
cub reporter for The DailyAsshole?
-Grampa, watch your language!
-l don't think you really need to know.
Better you leave here with your head
still full of kitty cats and puppy dogs.
Well, l really would like to know.
Hey, he'd really like to know.
Enlighten him!
Well, l bet you'd stick your head in a fire
if l told you you could see hell.
Meanwhile, you're too stupid to realize
you got a demon
sticking out your ass singing,
"Holy Miss Moley"
-"Got me a live one"
-Got me a live one
Can we change the subject, please?
Dinner's over!
Ladies and germs...
lt's Showtime!
Tell you a little story.
Eat your mom's pussy!
l mean, jam your face in it!
Yes, sir!
And starts licking
and chomping on her pussy,
and she's screaming and yelling,
and she just...
The old battleaxe at home's
liable to crush my balls!
"Would you be quiet?
"You're gonna wake up grandma!"
Bravo, man!
Hey, hey, hey, don't be moving now.
Don't be moving.
We got something real special
for you men out there.
Wow.
-All right.
-Jerry.
Get off him!
l said get the fuck off him,
you stupid, fucking whore!
Fucking slut!
-You shouldn't have done that.
-Oh, really?
Are you gonna do something about it?
l'll do something, motherfucker.
Yeah? Come on!
l'll fucking cut your tits off
and shove them down your throat!
-Baby, stop!
-Oh, come on!
-This bitch has got it coming.
-No, l told you, remember...
-Car's done.
-Thank God.
l suggest that you kids leave.
-We're gone.
-My hat.
-Fuck you!
-Bitch!
l love you, Mama.
l know.
-Open up the fucking doors.
-Hurry up.
Jesus Christ,
you'd think she was really gonna cut you.
Of course she was gonna cut me.
She's a fucking nut!
l knew she was crazy
from the second we fucking picked her up.
Okay. That's that.
Let's get out of this fucking nut house.
Go! Drive! Drive!
Drive! Drive! Drive!
Drive faster!
Go straight! Just go straight!
Shit! What are you doing?
Why are you stopping?
-l gotta open the gate.
-For Christ's sake, hurry up!
Jesus Christ!
Holy shit!
Jerry, wait! Come back!
No!
Shit! What are they doing?
Oh, my... What do we do?
-Shit! Run!
-Who is that?
Oh, my God!
Oh, Jesus!
-Help us somebody!
-Help!
The door! Shut the fucking door!
Oh, no!
Leave us alone!
Somebody help us!
Oh, my... Oh, my God!
Get away from me! No!
No! No!
No, please!
Oh, my God!
No! No!
Oh, my God!
No!
Get me out... Help me! Help me!
Help!
Help me!
Rock 'n' roll this morning
with some Led Zeppelin...
Yeah, it's kind of wild
around the radio station today,
it being a holiday.
lt's kind of like a ghost town around here.
lt's kind of nice, though.
lt's kind of kick-back.
Maybe time to get away with stuff.
Huston.
Donald Willis.
Don Willis, how the hell are you?
Listen, Frank,
l'm a little worried about Denise.
She called me last night
from the road near Ruggsville,
a place called Spaulding's.
Yeah, l know of the joint.
She said she'd be here about 1 1 :00
but she never showed up.
Well, l'll run a check
on up there by Spaulding's
and see if there's any accidents
or road closings.
lt was raining
like a son of a bitch here last night.
They're probably just
stuck in the mud someplace.
Shut your mouth!
l said shut your fucking mouth!
Listen, you Malibu
middle-class Barbie piece of shit,
l'm trying to work here.
Work? You ever work?
Yeah, l'll bet you have.
Scooping ice cream
to your shit-heel friends on summer break.
Well, l ain't talking about
no goddamn white socks
with Mickey Mouse on one side
and Donald Duck on the other.
l ain't reading no funny books, mama.
Our bodies come and go,
but this blood is forever.
Now...
l'm gonna remove your gag,
but if you make so much as a fucking peep,
l'm gonna cut you like a pig
and make you eat
your own fucking intestines, you got me?
Why are you...
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
-Messing up your day?
-Where's Bill?
Where's Bill?
Bill?
-ls he okay?
-He's a good guy.
He's been a great help to me,
a real blessing.
l mean, l couldn't
have asked for a better specimen.
You don't know
what kind of dry spell l've had here.
Total block, total block.
But Bill?
He's okay.
Where is he?
This is gonna hurt you a lot more
than it's gonna hurt me.
Where is he? Can l see him?
Can l see Bill, please?
Let's go see.
Behold!
-Fishboy!
-Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Bill!
No! No! This can't be real!
This can't be real! This can't be real.
This can't be real. This can't be real.
Oh, it's real.
Real as l want it to be, mama.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Well...
Let's see if the nut
that runs this place can help us.
Take a look at all this crap?
Red-flag anybody who runs a joint like this.
Sweet baby Jesus.
Whoever's jerking off on that bell out there
better be gone when l come out,
or l'm gonna rip your nuts off!
Officers, Officers, what can l do for you?
l ain't fired up the bird yet
if that's what you've been
ring-a-ding-dinging about.
l need you to answer
some questions about some missing kids.
l don't know nothing about nothing.
You see, l'm the kind of guy
just minds his own business,
if you get what l'm saying.
You seen this girl,
say, in the last 24 hours?
Yeah, yeah, cute kid.
Ain't my type, though.
You know, l like them with
a little more meat on them.
The bigger the cushion,
the sweeter the pushing.
Hey, look, clown ass,
just answer the damn question.
We ain't interested
in your love life, all right?
Cut the crap, Spaulding,
and just get with the facts.
-Huh?
-What did you see?
Who was she with? Where was she going?
l don't know.
She was with some stupid kids.
They was nosing around,
asking a bunch of stupid questions.
Questions about what?
l don't know. This and that.
Mostly a bunch of tired Dr. Satan bullshit.
They caught a gander
at the display in the back,
and they figured they was gonna run out
and solve the great Deadwood mystery.
And how'd they get that idea?
l wrote them a map.
Well, out to the old farm road, you know?
l figured, what the hell?
lt wouldn't do no harm.
Besides, it's good for my tourist trade.
You can shit 1 0 bricks for all l care.
What else?
Nothing.
Stupid-ass kids probably got themselves
turned around ass-backwards
and got theyself lost.
ls that all?
And l want you to think real hard.
Well, l don't rightly know.
See, they wasn't here long enough
for me to get up close
and personal with them,
like l do most the assholes
that come wandering in here.
How about you write them
same damn directions out for me, then?
All right, all right!
Don't get all True Grit on my ass.
You can knock yourself silly for all l care.
Enough talk!
Write.
l don't know where that Skunk Ape sleeps.
All l know is
he had impure relations with my wife.
That's true.
He performed lurid acts
upon me and my person.
Hold up the picture.
l'm gonna kill that Skunk Ape.
Please, Tiny. Please let me go.
Let me go. Help me.
Please. God, please.
Thank you.
l'm just gonna go now. l'm just gonna go.
l'm just gonna go home now.
l'm just gonna go now.
l'm just going home now.
Where the fuck
do you think you're getting to?
No, no, no!
No, no.
No! No! No!
No.
Playtime is over.
Suspect seen in...
lt matches.
Call it in.
-l think we found them.
-Yeah.
Hey, poopy pants. What's new?
Where the fuck is Bill? Where's Denise?
You can't keep us here!
Shut up!
Hey, you wanna play a guessing game?
Guess what number l'm thinking of.
Eat shit and die.
No, wait! Please! Come on, stop it!
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
Please be quiet. l don't want to slip.
Okay, one more.
You get this right, l'll let you go.
lf you get it wrong, you are fucked!
Okay, who's my favorite movie star?
l don't know.
Marilyn Monroe.
No. Bette Davis. Sorry! You lose!
Jesus, somebody sure
had themselves a field day
beating the shit out of this thing,
didn't they?
Yeah.
No mercy shown here.
Didn't find any bodies, did you?
-Not yet.
-Holy Christ.
What could these kids have possibly done
to bring this much hell down on them?
-Hey, l found something.
-What's that?
Keys.
Well, don't just stand there
like some prize dog dick.
-Open the trunk.
-Yes, sir.
Toss them here.
Oh, goddamn.
Got something, Georgie?
Yeah. We found something.
People come, people go,
but how many ever really stop to
take a look at the underbelly of the beast?
l make them stop, and l make them look.
Hope you like what you see.
Hope you like what you see!
Just hold it a minute, Grandpa.
At a time like this you're taking pictures?
l just couldn't help it.
You look so natural sitting in that car.
Put me behind the wheel of that bitch!
l'll show you driving!
You useless fuck.
You couldn't even get
your big ass in that seat.
Why, you ungrateful...
Don't start with me, Hugo.
Hey, get off the damn car.
This ain't your living room.
Goddamn grease monkey.
Sure this guy's supposed to ride with us
in this car?
Just doesn't seem right to me.
Well, it ain't up to us.
Chief said to pick him up
and take him with us.
Guy's an ex-cop.
Figures he can be of some help.
l just hope he doesn't get in my way
is all l'm saying.
This must be him.
-Mr. Willis?
-Yes, sir.
-l'm Wydell. This here is Naish.
-How you doing, sir?
Donald Willis.
Any leads?
Well, we were on our way out
to check on a couple of farms
out on the edge of town.
That's about our only lead up to this point.
What about this body you found?
You know about that?
Local girl, Karen Murphy,
one of the cheerleaders
who went missing last week.
That's it?
Well, we know the kids
were on their way out
to a place the locals call Deadwood.
Yeah, they want to play Nancy Drew with
this local legend that people call Dr. Satan.
-This is insane.
-Don't you worry about it.
We'll find her, all right?
My name is Lewis Dover,
and l know this man,
but l know the truth!
You don't have to go to hell.
You already there! This is hell!
This is hell! This is hell!
l'm gonna see if anybody's home.
You and Mr. Willis check around
and see if you see anything.
Come with me.
l hate fucked up families!
Just a dip.
Otis! Otis, come quick!
There's cops out there.
Goddamn! How many?
Hey, don't worry about it.
l don't know. l only saw one.
Hell, fucking pigs always travel in packs.
-Take this.
-Okay, Daddy.
Go downstairs and play nice.
l'll go around back and take control,
like l always fucking do!
Goddamn.
These pack rats throw anything away?
l don't think so.
Hold this right here.
Hello!
Hello.
You'd think these sons of bitches
would have a yard sale, don't you?
Yeah.
Hello?
lt's a dog!
Calm down, Barney.
-Don't you start in with that Mayberry shit.
-He's only a dog.
l was bitten by a cocker spaniel
when l was 8 years old.
-Well, hello, Officer.
-Afternoon, ma'am.
l'm Lieutenant Wydell.
l'd like to ask you a few questions.
Why, heck.
l'll just tell you anything you want to know.
Appreciate the cooperation, ma'am.
l'm looking for a missing girl.
l'm serious.
lt was big cocker spaniel, big teeth.
lt was my ex-girlfriend's.
Almost bit off my pinky toe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You hear that?
Yeah. Yeah, l hear it.
Where do you think it's coming from?
Out this way.
All right, hold on.
Hold on one second here. Hold on.
Hey! Hey! Sheriff's department.
Open up. Hey!
No, l ain't seen her. Sorry.
Ma'am, if l could just come in for a minute.
l have some other pictures
l'd like you to look at.
Might stir something up.
No. l don't think so.
Ma'am...it'll only take a minute.
All right.
l guess l can trust you,
being a man of the law and all.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
This one looks familiar.
Now, is he on the TV?
No, ma'am, l don't believe he is.
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Wydell!
-Wydell! Over! Wydell. Over.
-Wydell. Over.
Let me take a guess here.
Y'all having a Halloween party tonight.
Now, what makes you think that, big boy?
Well, you sure are buying
a whole mess of holy water for two people.
Yeah, we like to get fucked up
and do fucked-up shit,
you know what l mean?
Yeah, l like to get fucked up, too,
and do some fucked-up shit.
Yeah, l bet you do.
How much we owe you, Goober?
Actually, it's G. Ober, for Gerry Ober.
But the new guy Ronald, in the back,
he drew in that other "o" and made Goober.
Fucking asshole.
Great story, Goober.
How much we owe you?
Well, the damage is quite severe. $1 85.
That ain't gonna break my bank, honey.
Here. Keep the change
and go get yourself a new name, Goober.
Holy dog! l will! Thank you! Y'all drive safe.
Thanks for coming in
to Red Hot Pussy Liquors.
Where's Otis? Where's Otis?
He's coming.
He got something real special this year.
Otis! Otis! Otis!
Otis! Otis!
l'm the one who brings
the Christmas candy.
Now tell me...
Who's your daddy?
l'm the one who brings the devil's brandy.
Who's your daddy?
l'm the one who beats you
when you're bad.
Who's your daddy?
Come on, sweetie.
Give the old man some sugar.
Daddy?
Daddy.
And l'm the one who loves you
when you're fucking dead!
Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?
Shame on you, little darlings.
Maybe it just ain't a good idea
to be prancing around
where you don't belong.
And you.
The grave rustler of fools.
What was it you were after?
Come on. Speak to me, boy.
Oh, l remember now. Dr. Satan.
God damn it,
everybody got to know about Dr. Satan.
You know what l'm gonna do, boy?
l'm gonna do you a favor.
l'm gonna let you meet the old bastard.
lt's all true.
The bogeyman is real and you found him.
And you found him...
Hey, happy boy, step your ass up here.
Take his gag out.
lt's more fun with the screaming.
l like that, too, that screaming.
lt's so much more exciting that way.
Please don't kill us. Please don't kill us.
Please don't kill us.
Shut your mouth
and get your shit in the box.
Get in now.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
l wanna say good-bye.
Good-bye, sweetie.
We could have been great.
Look, look, look, just let us go.
l swear to God, we won't tell anyone.
l swear.
Honey, now, you know l can't do that.
"l swear to God we won't tell anyone.
l swear to God."
Ain't we just having a fucking hoot?
Get your fucking ass up, boy.
All right, come on.
Get in the box, and he's gone.
Now, where does she think
she's gonna run to?
What, is she gonna run all the way home?
-No! Let me get her.
-Oh, all right. Go get her.
Hunting humans...
Ain't nothing but nothing.
They all run like scared little rabbits.
Run, rabbit, run.
Run, rabbit!
Run, rabbit! Run, rabbit!
Run, rabbit, run!
Run, rabbit!
There once was a woman
who lived with her daughter
in a cabbage garden.
Along came a rabbit
and ate up all the cabbages.
The woman said, "Go into the garden
and drive out the rabbit."
Mary, l'm gonna get you!
l'm gonna get you!
Mary! Mary!
l'm gonna get you! l'm gonna get you!
l got you!
"Shoo, shoo," said the maiden.
"Come, maiden," said the rabbit,
"sit on my tail
and go with me to my rabbit hutch."
No! No!
-No!
-No hanky-panky.
Rufus, put the lid on.
No!
Oh, God!
Oh, no!
No! No!
No, no.
Stop! No!
No!
Stop! No!
No!
Jerry, wake up. Wake...

Oh, my God!
Jerry!
Oh, God! Jerry!
Denise!
Help me!
lt's eating me!
Jerry? ls that you?
Jerry?
Oh, thank... Thank God.
Please help me.
...his terrifying experiments.
Do you know anything
about the legend of Dr. Satan?
Jerry?
No. No. No.
No!
No! No, no, no, no.
No! No!
No!
Go away!
Sweet baby Jesus, girl!
What the hell happened to you?
l got away.
You...
Yeah, l recognize you.
There's a whole bunch of people

l gotta get to a doctor.
All right. All right.
Just sit back and relax.
l'll get you to a doctor.
Come on, now. That's it. That's it.
