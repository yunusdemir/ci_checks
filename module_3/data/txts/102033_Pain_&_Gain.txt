All they got is testimony
from some fucking cokehead.

to do was listen to</i>

<i>In light of his cooperation,</i>

he seemed legitimately grateful.</i>
<i>I once was lost</i>

<font color="#808080">ED:</font> <i>Daniel Lugo and Adrian Doorbal</i>
<i>were found guilty
of double murder, racketeering,</i>
<i>attempted extortion, theft,</i>
<i>attempted murder, armed robbery,</i>
<i>burglary, money laundering and forgery.</i>
<i>In fact, the only thing
they weren't found guilty of</i>
<i>was the one thing
they were most guilty of,</i>
<i>being dumb stupid fucks.</i>
<i>It took the jury only 14 minutes</i>
to sentence them both to death.

This seems like such a waste.
People's lives.
You know?
Some people just don't
know a good thing
when it's staring them in the face.

<font color="#808080">ED:</font> <i>It really is the simple things in life.</i>
<i>Daniel just wanted to be like everyone.</i>
<i>Everyone that wants
the American dream.</i>
<font color="#808080">DANIEL:</font> <i>All I ever wanted out of life</i>
<i>was what everyone else had.</i>
<i>Not more.
Just not the less I was used to.</i>
<i>Well, I took a real swing for it,
you know?</i>
<i>And for a while, it was like
I always thought it would be.</i>
<i>I was one of you.</i>
<i>And it felt good.</i>
<i>People finally saw me like I saw myself</i>
<i>and you can't ask for more than that.</i>
<i>Maybe I did, though.</i>
<i>Maybe it got so I didn't want to
be "equal to" anymore.</i>
<i>I wanted to be "better than."</i>
<i>And that's a recipe for injury.</i>
<i>That doesn't mean you give up, though.</i>
<i>You rest, you heal and
you get back on that bench.</i>
<i>Life is going to give me another set.</i>
<i>And I am going to rock it.</i>
<i>Because my name is Daniel Lugo,</i>
<i>and I believe in fitness.</i>

That's the American dream.
