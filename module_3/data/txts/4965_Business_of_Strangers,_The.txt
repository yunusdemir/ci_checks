Hi, Angela. How are you?
My schedule? Let's see.
I have a management pitch,
then a layover.
Same thing tomorrow in Atlanta,
Dallas, and Salt Lake.
Why does he want to know?
Well, listen...
when you have more information,
will you call Deb?
Right. She knows my life.
Thanks, Angela. Bye-bye.
Deb, why is
the CEO'S personal assistant...
asking me about my schedule?
Did she say what it was about?
I don't know.
I don't think it's good.
He's flying here for dinner.
He must think I'm a fool.
He's never done
something like this.
Just copy the files,
copy the contact list.
Messenger it to my house.
Call Nick. Headhunter.
Nick Harris. Yeah.
I want to see him today.
He can grab a shuttle.
Right. I have no idea,
but I don't think it's good.
Call me back. Bye-bye.
Julie Styron. I'm here
for the Intech presentation.
-Is my tech person here?
-Not that I know of.
-Bathroom?
-Down the hall, first right.
When that tech person
gets here...
would you tell him who I am?
Did you hear anything?
Did you ask around?
I can't believe this.
This is not right.
How am I supposed to do
this dog and pony show...
for these idiots
with this hanging over me?
After all these years.
The strong numbers
speak for themselves.
Our growth has been
a solid six years running.
We've beaten
Street's estimates...
four out of
the last five quarters.
And R&D has
exciting new software...
that will shake up the industry.
With this new software, we can
pull up statistical data...
using a customized interface,
in half the time...
using the same hardware.
This puts us years ahead
of any of our competitors.
My assistant
has finally arrived.
Suppose we could take a break
while she sets up?
Sorry. We don't have time.
Thanks for coming.
The pleasure was all mine, Bob.
It really was.
Hope we can do it again
sometime.
Thanks.
Bye. Thanks so much.
My flight was late.
It's not my fault.
Terry, hi. It's Julie.
About that A.V. person
you sent me...
-What was your name?
-Paula.
That Paula person
arrived 45 minutes late.
I do the whole fucking show
by myself without visuals.
I have made this
perfectly clear.
These are big game
fund managers.
We are not to fuck around.
As far as I'm concerned,
she's fired.
Yeah. Thanks, Terry.
Hey, uberfrau...
"The pleasure was all mine, Bob.
"I hope we can do it
again sometime."
Hi, it's me.
Did the headhunter
grab the shuttle?
Good. I'll meet him for drinks
before the dinner.
What?
Where?
What's the agenda?
Just tell me, Deb.
How can they have
a board meeting...
without notifying
the vice president?
I can't believe
he'd do this to me.
No, I'm here.
Well...
just keep me posted
if you hear anything.
Right. Yeah.
Listen, call me later.
Thanks. Bye.
Fuck off.
I've killed myself for this...
working like a dog
year after year.
I just can't believe
they'd have the nerve.
I can see them
passing me over, but...
firing me?
Maybe it's a blessing
in disguise.
A really brilliant disguise.
What's that saying?
A wolf in sheep's clothing.
Some wolf.
Feel like the sheep...
or the goat.
What?
I'm sorry. Is it...
You're quite right.
Next week, same time.
Thank you, Dr. Yao.
Julie Styron.
It's been a long time.
Hi, Nick. How are you?
Thanks for coming.
Hope it wasn't
too much of a bother.
Actually, with the shuttle,
it was no problem.
-You want something?
-Sure. What's that?
-Scotch.
-Sounds good.
Another one of these, please.
Thanks.
-So, I asked you here...
-And I'm here.
Yes, but then
I started to think...
who's to say you're not
finding my replacement?
I wouldn't have come here
if I were...
Please, Nick.
I know how you got me my job.
You're a headhunter.
That's what you do.
Placement provider.
I've seen you guys
slither into offices...
and decimate small companies.
At Arrowtech, they were
throwing themselves out windows.
You can get someone else
if you don't feel...
As long as
you can assure me...
that you're not working
to find my replacement.
You have my word.
Let's see what you got.
All passengers
waiting for Flight 352...
please be advised that due
to severe weather conditions...
at point of arrival,
the flight has been canceled.
Please go
to ticket counter "B"...
not the boarding gate,
for alternative arrangements.
The Continental Hotel
courtesy shuttle.
Next stop, Continental Hotel.
Where is Pacific Net?
They're going belly up.
Interested in abroad?
A number of Tokyo companies
are looking.
No. I don't have to go
to Japan...
to get stepped on
just because I've got tits.
I got a big dose of that
in my native tongue.
I've got to powder my nose
and go get fired.
Don't worry.
We'll make this work for you.
-Thanks for coming.
-You bet.
Talk to you soon.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I just wasn't expecting this.
Why not?
Well, I'm...
I thought you were happy.
But it's time for me
to do other things.
You're ready
to run this company...
and you're going to do
a great job.
Will the board approve?
That's not
going to be a problem.
-You OK?
-Oh, yes.
This is supposed
to be good news.
Yes. I'm very happy.
You should celebrate.
I will.
What are you going to do?
I'll think of something.
When you come back,
we'll have a big party.
That would be very nice.
I'll see you when you get back.
Robert, thank you.
How'd it go?
Just fine.
You want another round?
I'm buying.
I've just been made
chief executive officer.
No shit? Congrats.
We can leverage this
for that Pacific Net job.
You said
they were going belly up.
With all due respect...
I wasn't talking
to CEO material before.
Too bad. I was looking forward
to working with you.
Thanks again.
Catch you next time.
Welcome to the Continental Hotel
courtesy shuttle bus.
Hi, Deb. Sorry I missed you.
Call you at home.
Hi, Jerry.
How you doing? Is Deb there?
Oh, no. I'm fine.
I had some good news
I wanted to tell her.
How are the kids?
Great.
Dewar's on the rocks, please.
Thank you.
Fuck off.
Listen, I was a bit harsh
on you before.
I lost my temper.
You're not fired.
I'll call Terry in the morning.
I don't really care.
It's just a money job.
I was rough on you.
I was stressed.
I'm sure you were.
-Ladies.
-Let me buy you a drink.
Martel X.O. Supreme.
-That's $20 a glass.
-I'll have a double.
Same.
May I?
So, if this is a money job,
what should you be doing?
Why do you want to know?
I'm curious.
I'm a writer. Non-fiction.
That's interesting.
What does that mean?
Biographies?
Historical journalism?
No, short stories.
Things that I experience.
The whole fiction thing
is too stupid. It's too neat.
I like the sloppiness
of real life.
You write for on-line zines?
Some,
but I'm basically old school.
-I've been published.
-Really?
Small literary magazines.
They're always good.
Why do you carry all
that equipment around with you?
My flight got canceled.
They gave us a meal ticket,
but were too cheap for a room...
so I'm hanging out
until the next flight.
-When's that?
-Seven a.m.
Where are you sleeping?
I'll crash at the airport.
Don't be ridiculous.
Get yourself a room.
Don't be stupid.
The company will pay for it.
But I was fired.
You're not fired...
and I already apologized
for that.
I don't have a credit card.
I ran up my limit too quick.
They're bullshit, anyway.
I'm sure they are.
Come on.
Let's get you a room.
I'll put it on my card.
Are you serious?
Yes. Come on.
All right.
What are you going to do now?
I don't know.
Go to the gym, the pool.
Do you have
an extra bathing suit?
-Well, I...
-Forget it.
No, no. I do have a pair
of running shorts...
if that would work.
Jesus.
What?
-Nice room.
-Thanks.
I love that.
The company pays for all this?
Sure.
May I?
Go ahead.
So, what's your poison?
-Scotch.
-A very manly drink.
Yes, I know.
Isn't that exciting?
I can't believe it myself.
Who told you?
Yeah. Well, look...
We'll talk when I get back.
We'll have dinner,
just the two of us.
Thanks, sweetheart. Bye-bye.
Is that your hubby?
No, it's my secretary.
She's a good friend.
That's very nice of you.
Thanks very much.
I hate howthese hotel windows
never open.
They don't want you
to breathe real air.
Or jump.
All this demographically-tested
interior design.
It's all
so fucking claustrophobic.
I bet you get all the channels.
I bet after 11:00,
you get the porno channels.
Ever notice how all the men
leave hotel bars after 11:00?
Have you ever seen a porno?
Once. Why?
I watch them all the time.
It's fascinating
to see how men view sex.
A number of pornos
are directed by women.
Really?
They're very similar...
but there's less sex
and more foreplay.
Where are these shorts?
This is cute.
Listen, I'm sorry.
About what?
-You know.
-No.
-I just wasn't in the mood.
-For what?
-You know.
-No.
Before.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
The strap-on.
-You're so picky.
-It's just a little weird.
I'm just trying to add
a little spice.
-Excuse me for trying.
-I'll get used to it.
Is it too big?
Is it because it's black?
Well...
-You're a racist.
-I just...
No, no. You're a racist.
Excuse me.
"Is it because it's black?"
Oh, my God.
Almost there.
Fucking A.
Congratulations.
You have reached two miles.
Jesus Christ.
Congratulations.
You have reached two miles.
Nice workout.
-You run every day, don't you?
-Every now and then.
Bullshit. You hustled me.
You knew what you were doing.
I haven't run this hard
since I was in college...
but if I was in shape,
I'd kick your butt.
-You're a very good runner.
-Yeah, right.
Where'd you go to college?
-Dartmouth.
-How nice.
I hated it. And you?
Then it was called
East Michigan Community College.
God knows what it's called now.
Sounds cool.
Why don't they have a gym
at the company?
I don't know.
Kiss up the boss.
Get him to cough up for a gym.
I am the boss.
Tonight at dinner...
I was made chief executive
officer at Intech.
You're kidding.
No, I'm not kidding.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
I just need it to sink in.
You've worked hard,
sacrificed a lot, haven't you?
Bet you ate a lot of shit
to get where you are.
It's my choice.
Nobody forced me.
It still can't be easy.
Everybody eats shit.
It's a question of degree.
Or how much you can take.
I don't know how you do it.
How is it?
It's nice. Not too bad.
It's not bad.
Shit. My shorts came off.
What's so funny?
Just give them to me.
No, seriously, come on.
Come on.
Come on. I'm going to give him
a heart attack.
Here. I'll cover you.
God, it's so hot.
It's good for you.
It sweats out all the junk.
What junk? I'm a vegetarian.
I was referring to the junk
in your mind.
Right. You should talk.
Is this what a hot flash
feels like?
I went through your stuff.
I saw your hormone medication.
Excuse me?
-I always do that.
-That doesn't make it OK.
How would you like it
if I went through your stuff?
You're an interesting person.
Jesus.
Actually, it's pretty close.
Really?
I remember
the first time it happened.
I was in sales.
I was courting
this big lawfirm in Milwaukee.
I snagged box seats
for a Packers game.
So there I am,
freezing my ass off.
God, I don't know shit
about football.
All I know is,
when they reach fourth down...
you yell,
"Hey, they're holding the line."
I have no idea
what I'm talking about...
but I keep yelling it,
and they're really impressed.
So...it's toward
the end of the game.
We're drinking beer.
And suddenly,
out of nowhere...
I start sweating bullets.
And I take off my jacket,
my sweater.
We're in an outdoor stadium.
It's three below zero.
I'm sitting there, looking
under the fucking seats...
to see where the fucking heat's
coming from...
surrounded by thousands of guys
in fluffy parkas...
and I'm sitting there
practically naked.
Then it hits me.
It finally hits me.
It's like suddenly realizing...
you've been made
a different person...
and no one's ever asked you.
Of all places in the world,
Lambeau Field.
I was never so depressed
in all my life.
So, what happened?
The game went into overtime.
The Packers won.
They signed the papers...
and today, they're still
one of our biggest accounts.
So you kicked butt anyway.
Prada fits me nice.
I'm surprised
you're the same size as me.
-I work out a lot. I run.
-From what?
Young skinny bodies
like yourself.
It's just not fair.
So, are you married or what?
I was. A long time ago.
Divorced?
Yeah. I left.
Why?
He wanted a child,
and I didn't.
That's very butch of you.
-Is it something you regret?
-Yes.
How long ago was that?
Twelve years.
You should give him a call.
He's married,
has a couple of kids.
I hate it when they do that.
-Do you date?
-From time to time.
We'll find you
some cute guy at the bar.
-Cheers.
-All hail the new queen.
I thought I'd find you here.
What happened to your flight?
It got delayed.
I have a couple hours to kill.
-Are you celebrating?
-I certainly am.
-Are you drunk?
-Mm-hmm.
I have every right
to enjoy myself.
Yes, you do.
I can do whatever I want.
You be careful.
I will be.
Scotch still your poison?
I'll be right back.
How you doing?
I'm a little drunk,
but I'm OK. I'm great.
Good.
-You all right?
-Yeah. I'm fine.
It's coming.
Nick, this is Paula.
Paula, this is Nick.
Watch out for him.
He's a headhunter.
Very slippery.
Excuse me.
Where are you going?
I can't talk now. Bye-bye.
Where'd Paula go?
To the bathroom.
She a friend of yours?
We just met.
And she works at the company?
I guess so.
What does she do?
I don't know.
I'm just asking.
I'm not your mother.
You can do whatever you want.
-I was just curious.
-I bet you were.
You all right?
What's the matter?
Is it Nick?
It's none of your business.
I know him.
-From where?
-Boston.
And?
I don't feel like
staying here right now.
We don't have to stay.
Let's go.
Let's just ditch
what's-his-face.
No problem.
So, you really want to know?
Sure.
Four years ago,
he raped a friend of mine.
Someone I was very close to.
We went to Boston.
Our first big frat party.
It was a big deal.
We both got really drunk.
He was a grad student.
We were supposed to keep
an eye on each other...
but I ended up at
the sorority party next door.
Anyway, he...
he took her to a room...
and he wanted to,
but she didn't.
Are you sure it was him?
Of course. I'd remember
that slimy fuck anywhere.
Did you call the cops?
She didn't want to.
It really fucked her up.
She basically stayed in her room
until she graduated.
You two are very close?
Between boyfriends,
we sort of slept together.
The whole thing divided us.
She knew how mad I was.
I wanted that fucker to pay.
I couldn't help myself.
I threatened
to cut his balls off.
What did he say to that?
He just laughed and asked
if I would suck his dick first.
I can't believe
he didn't recognize me.
Fucking bastard.
-What?
-I don't know.
Let's just forget about it.
No. They want you
to forget about it.
There's nothing
that we can do about it...
so let's just drop it.
You can't pretend
it didn't happen.
-Leave it alone.
-No. We should do something.
Like fuck him?
I'm not really following you.
He should knowthat we know.
Embarrass him.
He should understand
what it feels like.
You and me?
Don't make me laugh.
Why not?
He thinks he got away with it.
But he has.
Something should be done.
Will you fucking stop it?
It happens all the time.
It's over.
I don't want
to think about it anymore.
Where'd you go?
What do you want?
It's only 12:00.
Come down for one more.
-It's late.
-Come on.
Don't be such a spoilsport.
Let's have some fun.
She's got a stocked bar
in here, you know.
Now you're talking.
Don't worry.
We won't trash the room.
We're drinking
Hamptons iced tea.
What's that?
Same as a Long Island...
but I spit in it
and charge you double.
That's good! I like that.
How about I make you
something special?
Great.
Sit down. Relax.
Thanks. Think I will.
Here you go.
Thanks.
That's good.
Thank you.
So, you heard
about the duchess?
I did. I thought I bagged
myself a big commission...
but instead I'm stuck here
in this godforsaken hotel.
Throwing down shots
with a couple of babes...
on a rainy night.
Let's see what's on TV.
You're the big hunter.
Find us something good.
So...
do you like good times, Nick?
What do you mean?
You heard me.
Sure. Why do you ask?
We just wanted to know.
We're curious that way.
You're something else,
you knowthat?
In what way
am I something else?
I mean, you're just...
I'm just what?
Different. Cocky.
I'm...cocky.
You hit the nail on the head
with that one, Nick.
It almost seems like
you two know each other.
It's weird how you know me.
What do you mean?
Do I look familiar?
Kind of.
Why, have we met?
I don't know.
I just thought...Stop.
No. The other one.
What's the matter?
You don't like
love stories, Nick?
How's that drink, Nick?
You want another one?
No. This is good. Thanks.
Take your shoes off.
Relax.
Sure.
I'm gonna go to the...
It's right in there.
Jesus Christ!
You're pathetic!
Fuck you!
You said you wanted
to do something.
-You said you were serious!
-So I said.
You can't back out now.
-I can do anything I want.
-It's too late.
-I think you'd better go.
-Bye.
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you all right?
Sweetheart, are you OK, honey?
Shit.
Oh, my...
Are you OK, fuckface?
Jesus!
-Let's drag him to the bedroom.
-What did you do?
Stop whispering.
He can't hear you.
Come on. Help me.
Is he all right?
Wait. Hold on.
Oh, God.
What did you do?
What does it look like?
I drugged him.
-You what?
-Gave him some of your pills.
-My pills?
-Yeah.
Valium, Zoloft...
maybe a couple
hormone replacements.
Hormone replacements?
-Maybe he'll growtits.
-That's not funny.
-It's mostly the Valium.
-How much?
I don't know. Five, eight?
-Jesus!
-Is that too much?
-How much do you take?
-One.
-But he's a man.
-What's that supposed to mean?
They're bigger.
They have thicker blood.
We needed to knock him out.
You certainly did that.
Suppose he's OK?
I don't know.
Check his pulse.
I would, but I can't
even find my own pulse.
Why does that not surprise me?
-Well?
-I don't know.
-What do you mean?
-I'm not a fucking doctor.
It's very slow.
I think he needs
medical attention.
No way. He's fine.
Just let him sleep it off.
It's slow.
He needs a doctor.
What do we say?
We drugged the fucker...
but can you please
check him out?
Do you want him to die?
There's a life experience...
a prison diary.
Be the envy
of all your friends.
You're so fucking dramatic.
His pulse is fine.
His pulse isn't fine.
It's slow.
It's your pulse that's fast.
You're a fucking head case.
Take mine.
Well?
My pulse is fast.
It's way fast.
You need to calm down.
Oh, God. What are we
going to do with him?
I don't know. You said you
wanted to teach him a lesson.
I didn't think
five minutes later...
he'd be passed out
and half-dead.
We didn't talk about it.
No. That is
the painful truth right now.
Don't have a fucking cow.
I'll have a fucking cow
if I feel like it!
I can't believe
this is happening.
I can't believe
I let you do this to me.
-Me?
-Yes, you.
He's fine.
Just let him sleep through it.
What happens when he wakes up?
We'll say he got drunk
and passed out.
He'll never believe that.
He can't wake up in this room.
Get him out of here.
You want to walk him
through the lobby?
He can't wake up in this room.
What about your floor?
The part under construction?
Oh, right. Let's drop him off
in front of my room.
You have a better idea?
God, the bastard's heavy.
I think I pulled my arms
out of whack.
Oh, shit.
-What?
-I forgot his briefcase.
I better get it.
Don't do anything
till I come back.
Like what?
Just don't do anything.
What are you doing?
-What?
-What are you doing?
If you or I black out
and wake up half-naked...
we're gonna wonder
if we were raped.
When this fucker
wakes up half-dressed...
he'll wonder,
"Jesus, what did I do?"
Because he knows,
like all men...
he has the potential
to do what he shouldn't.
And so he would be reluctant
to ask what happened.
Exactly.
I dare you to touch it.
-What?
-His dick.
I don't want to touch his dick.
You can touch his dick.
You don't think I won't?
I wouldn't put it past you.
Damn straight.
It's clammy.
What do you think?
Got a pen?
Biblical shit
always freaks people out.
Here we go.
"The righteous shall rejoice...
"when he seeth the vengeance.
"He shall wash his feet
in the blood of the wicked."
Close.
Let me take a couple of you.
Come on.
Just stop it.
Someone's getting mad.
I don't want to have
my photograph taken.
Why? Give me a reason.
You don't trust me.
-It's not a matter of trust.
-Yes, it is.
The duchess doesn't want
any evidence of her involvement.
It's good to know
who your friends are.
You and your stupid career.
I've never seen anyone
so miserable in my life.
You have no family.
Your secretary
is your best friend.
How pathetic is that?
Cover him up.
It's the security guard.
I'm surprised.
I thought
you wanted to get caught.
You know, the excitement of
being exposed and humiliated.
Maybe a little rough stuff.
That's why we're here,
isn't it?
We're here because you're
a profoundly disturbed woman.
If you were a man, you'd see
a dominatrix twice a week.
All CEOs have one.
But we're women, so we don't
do things like that.
We express issues of doubt
and control differently.
-You do have them, don't you?
-What?
Control issues.
You feel overwhelmed,
unworthy...
unable to keep things in order,
so you punish yourself.
You obsess over
control and power...
and you have bad, even abusive
relationships with men.
You know nothing about me
or my relationships.
I've seen the way you run.
You push yourself hard,
really hard.
I bet there's some deep shit
going on there.
Will you shut up?
I bet you come from
some tough times.
Little girl on
the wrong side of the tracks.
You've managed to work hard
and pull yourself out.
Now you've won everything...
but something
just doesn't feel right.
-Fuck you.
-Whatever you say, duchess.
Stop calling me that.
-Stop it!
-Why should I?
Fuck you,
you privileged little brat.
I've seen a thousand girls
just like you.
Rich families,
all the opportunities...
and you throw it all away.
You put on this act...
disaffected, obnoxious...
talented, but undiscovered.
You know what?
You all end up with
your sensitive husbands...
pregnant, coming back,
pleading for a job...
and making my coffee.
It's OK, Paula.
Nobody ends up being
what they really want.
That's part of life.
It's called growing up.
I'm going to sing.
Just calm down.
I have a very nice voice,
I hope you know.
I have nothing to lose.
You have everything.
We'll both end up in jail.
She was my boss, my employer.
She threatened to fire me.
You can ask Human Resources.
Drugs? I don't know
where they came from.
Ms. Styron worked
very hard for many years.
I wonder what
the psychological toll is...
for all those years in the nasty
male-dominated business world?
She's not married,
she doesn't have any children.
Most women her age
do have children.
Why doesn't
she have any children?
She's probably a bitter, sad...
Maybe she hates men.
What does someone
who isn't married...
doesn't have children,
and hates men do?
I wonder.
It is all about trust.
Smile.
Kiss me.
Admit it, Julie.
You hate your job,
your humdrum life...
Come on.
You've gotten this far.
Open one of the doors.
You know you're curious.
It's your choice of pleasure...
the humiliation
of getting caught...
or kissing me.
Go on...
sing.
You would sacrifice
your career...
your future,
your whole fucking life...
rather than give someone
the upper hand?
You're a piece of work.
Give me them. Come on.
Give me the pictures.
Let me have the pictures.
Fuck off!
You fucking...fucking bitch.
I can't believe you hit me.
I'm sorry, but you can't
expect me to be so naive.
I wasn't going
to get you in trouble.
I would never do anything
like that to you.
Come on. Let's go.
-We're pathetic.
-We're not pathetic.
Bastard!
-You fucking asshole!
-Paula, stop it!
You have no fucking idea!
I know.
No, you don't!
What? That it's you?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, asshole!
Are you happy now?
You figured it out!
I have no fucking friend!
You're so fucking smart!
He took me
to some pukey little room...
and pinned me down
and fucked me, OK?
Aren't you the smart one?
A regular fucking Sherlock.
Stop it!
Hello there.
I missed my plane last night.
I fell asleep in the lounge.
Really?
What time did I leave
your room last night?
About 1:00.
Yeah. That's what I thought.
I went back to the bar...
and talked
to this stockbroker guy.
Talked all night.
Interesting guy.
Gave me some hot leads.
Then I fell asleep
right there in the lounge.
-It happens.
-It sure does.
You OK?
-Hangover?
-Probably.
You're the big cheese now.
You can live it up.
Hell, if I was you, I'd be
bouncing off the fucking walls.
I'm tired.
Maybe you need
to take some time off.
Maybe.
Maybe I should just quit.
The thing is,
I can't do that anymore.
Take away this job,
I don't know what you got.
Sorry.
No. No problem.
Nick, can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Where'd you go
to graduate school?
-Why?
-Just curious.
I got my MBA at Ohio State.
Ever been to Boston?
Last year for a conference.
Why?
I mean before that.
-No.
-Sure?
Positive. Why?
I just thought we might have
known someone in common...
but we don't.
I'll bet that person's
never been to Boston.
I hear Boston's a party town.
That's what they say.
I don't know
how those kids do it.
I would've gone nuts.
I bet you would've.
