Come on, Doc.
- You gotta stay down here.
- Yeah.
Check this out.
Prints right here.
<i>Reporting live from the home...</i>
...of Dr. Richard Kimble...
...a prominent surgeon at
Chicago Memorial Hospital.
Details are sketchy...
...but we know that Dr. Kimble's wife,
Helen, was found murdered tonight.
Area 6 detectives are bringing
Dr. Kimble out.
We assume they will take him to
the Area 6 police station...
...where they hope he can shed some
light on what happened tonight.
As I indicated, she was found
shortly before midnight.
We know that she made
a 911 call to police...
...indicating that she was
being assaulted by an intruder.
Details are very sketchy.
We know that he and his wife Helen...
...were at the Four Seasons Hotel
earlier tonight...
...at a fundraiser for the
Childrens' Research Fund.
Rich, remember Cara?
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.
Straighten that arm. You'll slice.
Golf pro teach you that?
My wife.
Before I forget...
...thanks for the loaner.
Keys are downstairs.
- Any gas in it?
- Yes. Enough.
Alec, Richard Kimble.
- How are you?
- Dr. Kimble!
- Guess that works too.
- Absolutely.
- Anytime.
- Oh, yeah.
I think that's a great idea,
getting the guys to try that project.
Knock it off!
There's nothing to see here.
Come with me.
Thank you. I was down to my last joke.
<i>You look really beautiful tonight.</i>
Thanks, honey.
I know you hate these things, but
I love looking at you in a tux.
I feel I look like a waiter.
- Hello?
<i>- Dr. Kimble?</i>
- Yes, it is.
<i>- Sorry to bother you...</i>
<i>...but Dr. Stevens is in
Emergency Surgery and needs your help.</i>
Call him and say I'll be right there.
<i>Thank you, doctor.</i>
Thank you. Good night.
I'll wait up for you.
<i>I'll wait up for you.</i>
<i>Talk to me. What have we here?</i>
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>
A 58-year-old. Just pulled
his gallbladder. Bleeding.
Big time. It's in the liver bed.
- What are his coags?
- They're all messed up.
PT's 36 and the rest are off the wall.
Where is he from?
Lentz's name is on the chart.
We paged him, but no answer.
Let me in there. Give me some room.
Give me a clamp.
Give me suction.
<i>Have you been getting
any threats at work?</i>
Co-workers, hospital staff, anyone?
- No.
- Anything unusual going on?
Phone calls, people hanging up?
People coming to the door?
Tradespeople?
Not that I know of.
Back to that fight you had
with the one-armed man.
Did it happen upstairs or downstairs?
Upstairs.
And he had which?
A right or a left arm?
With a gimmick on it?
Right arm.
Is it one of those with the hooks, or...
No, he had a cosmetic hand.
The security system in your house,
it's a pretty good one.
Anyone else have the coding?
Our maid.
She knows the code and has a key.
Those scratches on your neck...
...did the one-armed guy do that?
Helen scratched me when I moved her.
Before or after the fight
with the one-armed guy?
I told you.
You own a gun?
Do you own a gun?
Yes, we have one in the house.
It's in your name?
Yes.
Where do you usually keep it?
The one that you own.
It's in Helen's table.
Bedside table.
Do you keep much jewelry in the house?
His fingerprints are
all over the lamp...
...the gun and the bullets..
...and the good doctor's skin
is under her fingernails.
Your wife's got the money
in the family, hasn't she?
Helen comes from a wealthy family, yes.
Is she insured?
Yes, she is.
Who's the beneficiary?
I am.
The sole beneficiary?
Yes.
Financially, you won't be
hurting after this, will you?
She was worth a lot of money.
Are you suggesting
that I killed my wife?
Are you saying that I crushed
her skull and shot her?
How dare you!
When I came home,
a man was in my house.
I fought with him.
- The one-armed man.
- He had a mechanical arm.
- Plastic? Rubber?
- Find this man!
You find this man!
How tall?
He took everything from me.
Oh, Jesus.
What did he weigh?
What color was his hair?
What color were his eyes?
We can't help you if you don't help us.
Book him.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
...you will hear iron-clad
proof of Richard Kimble's guilt.
Indisputable scientific evidence...
...that on the night of January 20...
...Richard Kimble did viciously...
...attack...
...and brutally murder his wife.
You'll hear more than that.
You will hear a voice from the grave.
The voice of Helen Kimble
identifying her killer...
...her husband, Richard Kimble.
Detective Kelly...
Tell us what you saw at the victim's
home on the night of the murder.
No forcible entry was found.
<i>From the beginning of the investigation,
it didn't appear to be a break-in.</i>
<i>Nothing was missing.</i>
I'm home.
Who won the game?
His prints were on the gun and bullets.
<i>No other sets were found,
other than the housekeeper's...</i>
<i>...and the deceased's.</i>
Mrs. Kimble's skull fracture caused
a massive hemorrhage to the brain.
It took less than 5 minutes
for her to die.
Your Honor, we'd ask to play Helen
Kimble's 911 emergency call...
...previously identified by
the Chicago Police Dispatcher.
<i>Emergency 911.</i>
Please help me.
<i>What's the problem?</i>
<i>He's...</i>
<i>He's still in the house.</i>
<i>Did I hear you right?</i>
<i>Someone's in your house?</i>
<i>He's trying to kill me.</i>
<i>Could you repeat that?</i>
<i>Ma'am?</i>
<i>He's trying to kill me.</i>
<i>Is your attacker still in the house?</i>
Richard...
He's trying to kill me.
Mr. Kimble...
...having considered all the aggravation
and mitigation in this case...
...and found the offense was brutal
and indicative of wanton cruelty...
...it's this court's judgment that you
be sent to the State penitentiary...
...where you will await
execution by lethal injection...
...on a date to be set forth by
the State Attorney General.
May God have mercy on your soul.
- Carlson.
- Here.
- Partida.
- Yeah.
- Copeland.
- What?
You be nice now.
Kimble.
Yeah.
Let's go, gentlemen.
Four prisoners coming out.
<i>Prisoners coming up.</i>
Let's go, gentlemen.
Kimble, you're here.
Carlson, right over there.
Partida, up front left.
Copeland, you're back here with me.
Make yourselves comfortable.
You know the routine, gentlemen.
I'm tired.
20 miles from Menard.
We'll be there in about 40 minutes.
I'll be glad to get rid of this load.
Let McKenzie care for them.
I hope he's got something
good to eat there. I'm starving.
Me, too.
Had enough prison chow.
Old Ed, he don't care.
His old lady's got him on a diet.
Right, Ed?
Get in here, quick!
He's getting sick! Move!
- He's foaming at the mouth.
- We're almost at the prison.
He's choking!
Wait!
Oh, shit!
Get over here.
You're a doctor, do something!
Unlock me!
You'll be okay.
What is that?
Shit!
Help me!
The hell with you.
Help me with this man!
Kiss my ass, Doc.
Listen...
I don't care which way you go.
Don't follow me. Got that?
Be good.
My, my, my.
What a mess.
It's a circus.
You got my bag?
Point of impact right here.
The first engine uncoupled, the
rest of the train jumped the track.
About 100 yards?
You must get new boots.
I told you not to wear the heels.
Wear 2 coats.
Next train wreck.
Why do we always mother her?
Because she loves us.
- How'd you like to be the driver?
- I bet he did a Casey Jones.
Hold it, sir.
Who's in charge?
Sheriff Rawlins.
Just follow the TV lights.
Sheriff Rogers.
Rawlins!
Look down there and take Newman.
Time to go to work.
The bus rolled over several times
before settling down the hill.
I don't know if I passed out...
...but when I looked up, the train
was bearing down on us. Fast.
I don't know how.
It's still kind of hazy.
I grabbed him and pushed
him out of the bus.
- You're brave, you could've been killed.
- I know.
He's my partner.
He'd have done the same for me.
Excuse me, I'm Deputy U.S.
Marshal Samuel Gerard, I'd like to...
I'll be with you in a minute.
Again, just for the record...
...these 3 are dead?
And this one?
Everything happened so fast.
I don't think he made it.
You came a long way for nothing.
With all due respect, Sheriff...
...I'd like to recommend
checkpoints on a 15-mile radius...
...at I-57, I-24 and
over here on Route...
Wait. The prisoners are all dead.
Checkpoints will get people frantic
and they'll flood my office with calls.
Shit, I'd hate to see that happen...
...so I'll take over your investigation.
On what authority?
The Governor...
...the U.S. Marshal's office...
...5th District, Northern Illinois.
All right, you want jurisdiction
over this mess, you got it.
Okay, boys, gather around and listen.
We're shutting it down.
Wyatt Earp here...
That's very funny, Wyatt Earp.
Sam.
Look here!
We're always fascinated when we find
leg irons with no legs in them.
Who held the key, sir?
Me.
Where are they?
I don't know.
Care to revise your statement, sir?
What?
Do you want to change
your bullshit story, sir?
- He might've got out.
- He might've got out.
You said he was part of the wreckage!
Set up operations by the fire truck.
Listen, everyone!
A fugitive has been on
the run for 90 minutes.
Average foot speed over uneven ground,
barring injury, is 4 miles an hour.
That gives us a radius of 6 miles.
What I want from each of you is a hard
target search of every gas station...
...residence, warehouse, farmhouse,
hen house, outhouse...
...and doghouse in that area.
Checkpoints go up at 15 miles.
Your fugitive's name
is Dr. Richard Kimble.
Go get him.
Don't give me shit.
I got 3 very unhappy dead people.
Put him on.
Stevens, it's Cosmo.
I'll have a satellite
telephone hook up in 2 seconds.
Police just found a blood trail...
...two miles southwest.
Match that blood against the prisoners'.
Get a fax I.D. on Kimble
to every local hospital.
Follow that with troopers.
What are you doing?
I'm thinking.
Think me up some coffee and a
doughnut with sprinkles on top...
...while you're thinking.
We got a live body!
A live one?
Hang in there. We'll
get you out of here.
Get that ambulance down here!
Is this what you want?
That's it.
I'll make copies.
Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
I have your breakfast for you.
We're thirsty today, aren't we?
Eat up before it gets cold.
It really gets dry in here, doesn't it?
Here you are.
Now, eat something.
You need your strength.
Doc, we're looking for a prisoner
from that wreck. Might be hurt.
What does he look like?
Six-one, 180, brown hair,
brown eyes, beard.
Seen anyone like that around?
Every time I look in the mirror.
Except for the beard, of course.
Doc!
Thanks.
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks, doc.
It's...
How is he?
Good, considering we dug
him out from under a train.
Tell the attending he's got a
puncture in the upper gastric area.
How could he tell that
by looking at his face?
Background just came in from Chicago.
About time. What've we got?
"Richard David Kimble,
vascular surgeon." What's that?
Somebody that makes
more money than you.
"Convicted of 1st-degree
murder of his wife.
Pleaded innocent.
Says a one-armed man did it."
Lots of friends.
Doctors, hospital staff.
We'll start there. I want phone taps.
First, his lawyer.
You'll never get that.
Call Judge Rubin.
Tell him I want phone taps.
Why'd you yell at me?
I'll tell him who if I'm in a good mood.
Why not yell at her sometimes?
We got a call from the hospital.
The wounded guard swears
he saw Kimble there.
That's hot.
And an ambulance is missing.
Where's he going in an ambulance?
Ambulance just spotted...
...two miles west of Doverville,
heading north, State Highway 53.
Running out of map!
Get your maps out.
Check, sound check. Get your maps out.
I want to know all routes
in and out of town.
We're headed north on Route 13,
toward the Barkley Dam.
Son-of-a-bitch!
Don't lose that ambulance.
Visual location of an ambulance headed
north on Route 13 toward Barkley Dam.
We'll pass through a viaduct.
Get on the horn. Bring Biggs and
Newman in from south of the viaduct.
He's hauling ass.
Is there a tunnel between here and there?
We have Biggs and Newman?
Look on your map to
know how to get there.
We got him!
Watch out! Watch out!
- What's going on?
- Get back in your car, sir!
Newman! Rock and roll!
Put a light in there!
What do you got?
I got nothing.
- What do you got?
- You must be kidding me!
You must be kidding me!
Seal off the tunnel! Seal it off!
We got a gopher.
Shit! I just bought these shoes.
Shut up, Cosmo.
Which way, Sam?
I didn't kill my wife!
I don't care!
Put that gun down!
Now!
Hands up!
Over your head!
Turn around!
Do you want to get shot?
Pay attention!
Get down on your knees!
Right now!
What happened? Where'd he go?
He did a Peter Pan right off this dam!
Right here!
Down! Boom!
Holy shit!
Can we go home now?
No.
Holy shit!
- There's no way out of here!
- We must go up.
Go up the stairs! Up, up!
Get them down here now.
Helicopters, divers!
Have that water turned off.
Come over here.
Put 2 cars and 4 patrolmen
on that bridge down there.
Have them glass this
river upstream and down.
I want a helicopter 100 feet off this
river. Make him aware of these wires.
Are you crazy? He's dead!
That'll make him easy to catch.
I want hounds on both banks
of this river for 2 miles...
...upstream and downstream.
- You've got a search-and-rescue team?
- Yeah, we do.
Get them down here and drag
the bottom of this spillway.
- Why isn't the water turned off?
- Somebody from County's working on it.
Bring in the helicopters now.
We're out of here!
I don't think there's anything to find.
Find it anyway. You've got
lights and generators coming.
- I won't tell you how to do your job...
- Put the helicopter on the bridge!
...but only one in a million could
survive that fall. He's fish food!
Get a cane pole and catch
the fish that ate him.
Get Stevens. Tell him
we're on the way in.
<i>That man took everything!</i>
We can't find the guy.
<i>We can't find the guy.</i>
<i>You find this man!</i>
<i>You find that man!</i>
The generators and searchlights
are there now.
They'll continue the
search into the night.
Good. Call Kentucky and
thank them for the dogs.
Remember, opera ain't over
until the Big Dog howls.
Need a ride?
Check it again.
All right, we got him. He shacked
up with some babe in Whiting.
She left work tonight and took him home.
- About 2 hours ago, her boss said.
- They spotted her car outside her house.
Does she run with anyone?
No one we could find. No family either.
Tell the police not to move till we get
there. We'll go early in the morning.
Your cousin still got his truck?
Tell him you need it.
Stay close.
Right on your ass, bud.
I don't want you getting lost.
Stick with me.
U.S. Marshals! Everybody down!
Hold it right there!
Show me those hands!
Keep them up!
Get your ass in there.
I got your man! I got
your man, you hear me?
I want out of here!
I got your man!
I'm going to blow his brains out!
I want out of here!
Do you hear me, cops?
Do you hear me?
I want out of here!
- Listen! We can work this out!
- Yes, we can.
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Listen to me.
Do you hear me?
Listen, and I'll tell you what I want.
I want a car out front.
Don't shoot.
It's over.
Shut up!
I can't hear anything.
I can't believe you did that.
You think I should've
bargained with him.
Yeah.
I do.
You could have missed...
...and killed me.
How bad is that ear?
Terrible. I'll have permanent damage.
Let me see it.
Come here.
Can you hear me now?
Yeah.
I don't...
...bargain.
You hear that?
Yeah.
Good.
Walter, this is Richard.
<i>Jesus! Why did you run?
It only makes you look guilty.</i>
I wasn't worried about appearances.
<i>Tell me where you are, so I can
meet you and you can surrender.</i>
I won't surrender. I need help, money.
You're asking me to aid a convicted
felon. I can't help you that way.
<i>My advice as your friend and attorney
is to give yourself up.</i>
<i>Now tell me, where are you?</i>
St. Louis.
<i>Give me an address.
I'll get there as soon as I can.</i>
Mr. Copeland was a bad man.
He was going to kill one of my kids.
You can blame me.
I'm the one that shot him.
<i>Give yourself up.
Now tell me, where are you?</i>
<i>St. Louis.</i>
So he's not dead.
Let that be a lesson to you.
Don't ever argue with the Big Dog.
Big Dog is always right.
You been right before.
<i>Walter, this is Richard.</i>
<i>Why did you run?
It only makes you look guilty.</i>
<i>I wasn't worried about appearances.</i>
<i>Tell me where you are, so I can
meet you and you can surrender.</i>
<i>I won't surrender. I need help, money.</i>
That train sounds like an El.
St. Louis doesn't have one.
How do you know it's an elevated train?
I lived under an El for 20 years.
Explain the difference between the sound
of an El and a train on the ground.
You must have ears like an eagle.
Play that back. I want to
hear the sound of an El.
What cities have Els? New York does.
- Philly.
- We do.
Milwaukee.
Hold it right there where the lawyer
says he sounds guilty. There's bells.
There's a guy on a P.A.
Can you drop everything but him?
I'll try.
<i>- Walter, this is Richard.
- Richard.</i>
Right there.
What's he saying?
Sounds like, "Next stop."
Do that again!
"Next stop"...
Merchandise Mart.
Son-of-a-bitch! The boy came home.
That bell is on the Wells Street bridge,
6 blocks away.
I knew it was an El.
Yeah, Big Dog. You're never wrong.
- I'll call the C.P.D.
- This is his Chicago file.
When I die, I want to
come back like you.
Happy and handsome?
- I'll notify the press.
- No press.
Right, no press.
- Hi, Billy.
- How's it going, sir?
- Good, and you?
- All right.
Here you go. See you.
Spare change? Dollar, Mister?
No, thank you very much.
I don't want it.
Oh, my God. Richard!
How are you, Charlie?
Jesus, you're back.
I need money.
Sure. Get in.
No, I can't. Whatever you got on you.
You're hot. If not now, you will be.
Have you got a place to stay?
How can I help you?
The light is green. Move!
I'll call you.
Why did Kimble kill his wife?
For the money.
For the money? He's a doctor.
He's already rich.
She was richer.
Is this the entire Chicago police file?
- That's everything.
- I want to do all the interviews again.
The list of hospital staff is there?
- Sure is.
- Thank you.
You don't want to use the media?
We want him to relax. Make himself
comfortable. Try to re-enter his life.
Here's the apartment.
You can see here is heater.
You will have warm.
Here is kitchen. Sink.
Over there is bathroom.
And here is the room.
Is nice bed.
Plenty space.
You can look at.
You like the place?
It's okay?
It's perfect.
All right, people.
This morning we were notified
by the Marshal's office...
...that our old friend Dr. Richard Kimble
is alive and well and back in Chicago.
You know in what high
regard we hold this scumbag.
I'm personally donating a
bottle of 12-year-old Scotch...
...to whoever collars this quack.
Dick Rosetti's passing out bulletins.
- Gunshot wound to the left shoulder.
- What are his vitals?
120 over 60. 98 pulse.
Help you?
You went to medical school together?
Yes, we did.
The class of '73.
Do you know Morton Feinberg?
- I do.
- He's a real nice guy.
When did you see him last?
Who, Richard?
I saw Richard this morning.
This morning?
He stopped my car. I gave him money.
Where was this?
Outside my tennis club.
Did he ask for help?
I volunteered. He wouldn't accept that.
How much did you give him?
Couple of bucks. What I had on me.
- He won't get far on that.
- Why'd he come back to Chicago?
He didn't tell me.
I'm sure he's trying to protect you
from having to lie for him, but...
You really want to be
his friend and help him?
Help us bring him in unharmed.
Why?
So he can go back to prison?
If you want help, gentlemen,
you've come to the wrong man.
Richard is innocent.
You'll never find him. He's too smart.
We're some smart guys.
What about us? We're smart. We are.
How smart could he be, really?
Is he as smart as you?
Smarter.
Peripheral vascular surgery. Fixing
arteries as they come out of the heart.
- How long have you known Richard Kimble?
- Ten years. Since I've been here.
What kind of medicine did he
practice at the hospital?
I want you to know that I believe
Richard Kimble to be innocent.
Would he seek your help?
If he did, I'd help him.
But he wouldn't come to me.
That's not his style.
<i>A warrant remains outstanding for
Chicago surgeon, Richard Kimble.</i>
This is where the one-armed guy and he
struggled and fell down the stairs.
I fell down these stairs,
I'd be a goner. I'd be dead.
What a waste!
<i>When I came home,
a man was in my house.</i>
- Police. We're the police!
- Where is he?
Get him, get him!
Hold it!
- Freeze!
- Get down. Where you going?
It's over.
You like stringing
out 12-year old girls?
What are you doing with my baby?
Your baby's a drug dealer.
Come on, ma'am.
What they doing to my baby?
It will be crazy here tonight.
Did they get a count?
A lot of kids.
They bring them all here?
All coming to County.
I've come to do those blinds.
I'll get the door.
I'll start in here, huh?
Let's go over it once more.
What time did he arrive at the house?
About 10:30 in the morning.
- He was alone?
- Yeah, he was alone.
- You got a good look at him?
- Yeah, really good.
You better be straight with me.
This is the guy staying in
your mother's basement?
That's what I'm saying.
Is she stable?
- Just breathe, stay calm.
- I need a doctor over here!
Call vascular and ortho
and call her parents for consent.
Okay, thank you doctor.
Hurts.
Hello, Marshal. It's right there.
My chest hurts.
Check the film on that kid.
Take a deep breath.
Inhale, exhale. Again.
Slowly.
Check the film.
Take it easy.
What's the status on that kid?
Possible fractured sternum.
I need you here.
Can you help us? Bring this
kid to Observation Room 2.
Yeah, you. Help us out, okay?
How are you champ?
My chest hurts.
Does it hurt when you breathe?
Yes.
- What's your name?
- Joel.
Look at this.
We're eating oranges and making I.D.s.
"C.C.H." What's that?
Cook County Hospital.
Just hang on, okay?
You'll be okay, pal.
You'll be fine.
Hold that elevator.
Thank you.
How're you doing?
My chest hurts.
Where's your mom?
I don't know.
Is she at home?
I think she's with my brother.
They downstairs?
I don't know.
Don't worry.
We'll find her.
Do you play football? Baseball?
Football.
Hold on, son.
Hey, doctor.
They sent this one from downstairs.
Get this one into Room 4, stat.
Bye-bye, Joel.
Where's that boy I sent here?
- What boy?
- The one with the fractured sternum.
He never came here.
He didn't?
No, he didn't.
Any particular interest
in that patient's X-rays?
- What do you mean?
- I saw you looking at his chest film.
- It's a hobby of mine.
- A hobby, really?
What's your other hobby, brain surgery?
- What do you want?
- To know how that boy got to surgery.
I'm a janitor. I do as I'm told.
Bullshit!
Who changed those orders?
I don't know what you mean.
Stay there.
Call Security!
Tell Stevens to get hold of
that guy Kelly over at C.P.D.
A guy disguised as a janitor orders
an emergency medical procedure...
...and all you did was
take away his I.D. card?
I called Security. He took off
down the hall. What was I to do?
Listen, Mr...
Deputy.
Gerard.
I'm really tired.
I'd like to go home.
- Okay. How's the boy doing?
- He saved his life.
Thank you.
"Desmondo Jose Ruiz."
Where are you, Desmondo?
Sammy, this is my problem:
The place is crawling with cops, right?
Everybody's looking for Kimble, right?
So why would he be stupid enough...
...to hang out in the trauma
ward and play Mother Teresa?
Excuse me.
Have a problem?
No, no problem at all.
Excuse me, could we
have a word with you?
This is Dr. Elway at
Cook County Hospital.
I'm following-up for the Prosthetic
clinic on Matthew Zelick.
Oh, he did?
I'm terribly sorry.
Right or left?
Right.
- Age?
- 35 to 45.
This is Ted Riley with the
High School Reunion Committee.
25 years is just around the corner...
...and Clive is on our
list of missing in action.
Information gave me a number,
but when I tried it...
No kidding.
Armed robbery?
He's where?
Point of attachment?
Mid-humerus.
That gives us 47 possibles.
47?
Cross-check these people
for criminal records.
Wait a minute.
Happy St. Patrick's Day to all.
Driscoll, Clive R.
One-armed man, armed robbery.
That's funny.
Question:
If they can dye a river green today...
...why can't they dye
it blue the other days?
Do I know?
- Are you Irish, sir?
- Who, me? No.
Are you?
No, man!
Name of inmate?
Clive Driscoll.
Driscoll, Clive.
I.D., please.
Driscoll, Clive R.
2-0-1-0.
Be advised that, by court ruling,
your conversation can be recorded.
This is hinky. He went to college.
He wouldn't go through all this security...
...go to lock-up to find someone
his own people say doesn't exist.
Hinky.
What does that mean, "Hinky?"
- Strange.
- Weird.
Say "strange" or "weird." "Hinky"
has no meaning.
Well, we say "Hinky."
I don't want you using meaningless
words around me. I'm taking the stairs.
How about "bullshit?"
Visitor for Driscoll.
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Over there.
Let's go, Driscoll.
You got 5 minutes.
Who are you?
Look, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
You got me down here...
...might as well talk.
Down here you got no entertainment.
Ain't no cable here.
I wish I could, but I can't.
Sorry.
Richard!
A man in a blue coat is waving
a gun and screaming at a woman.
Stop that man!
He's a U.S. Marshal! Let him go!
Let him go!
Shut the gates!
Open the doors!
We're on the roof.
Take some men! Look down there!
He's in the plaza!
He's heading east!
<i>He's going east toward the Picasso!</i>
We want you to give all these groups
a big round of applause.
They've been waiting a long time
to get in the parade.
They're cold,
just like all the rest of you.
Deputy Gerard, why do you feel
that Dr. Kimble came back to Chicago?
I have no idea.
We understand your deputies
were at the hospital today.
Was Dr. Kimble there?
I have no comment on that.
Let me get the chronology straight.
The subject was tried,
convicted, incarcerated...
...escaped, presumed dead, and is
now at large in Chicago. Correct?
Except for being presumed dead.
Do you believe that Kimble's
armed and dangerous?
I believe he's dangerous, yes.
He's taking chances, coming back.
Do you feel he's innocent?
No, he's not innocent. He was convicted
in a court of law. He's guilty.
How will you try to catch him?
We have no further comments for now.
Alec.
Richard Kimble.
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, Dr. Kimble.
Lentz!
<i>We've been trading phone
calls the last few days.</i>
A cruise sponsored by
Devlin MacGregor...
...could be fun.
<i>- Cancun, Richard.
- Sport fishing.</i>
Piña coladas.
What must the hospital buy?
What's the catch?
Sailfish.
No strings attached.
<i>What do you say? What do you say?</i>
This guy is bleeding from
every needle puncture.
Lentz sent this guy in?
Is he on that wonder drug?
Yes, he's on the RDU-90
protocol, Provasic.
Drug of the future.
Clean out those arteries
and put us out of business.
"Parade Master of Ceremonies
Ed O'Flaherty said..."
"...he didn't recall a livelier
parade during the last 20 years."
"That Kimble..."
"...is some kind of lad..."
"Lad?"
He says "lad."
Maybe he's a leprechaun.
I'm quoting this guy.
A guy on line 3 claims
he's Richard Kimble.
- Who?
- Another Kimble on line 3.
Let me see the phone.
Tell him he looks good in a beard.
- What line?
- Three.
"I hope he was able to wear a
little green, sip some whiskey..."
This is Gerard.
Remember what I told you in the tunnel?
It's him!
I remember it was noisy.
I think you said something like...
...you didn't kill your wife.
Remember what you told me?
I remember you pointed my gun at me.
You said, "I don't care."
He's on the south side.
That's right, I don't care.
I'm not trying to solve a puzzle.
I am trying to solve a puzzle.
5 seconds to location.
And I just found a big piece.
<i>Hello, Richard?</i>
He didn't hang up.
Where is he?
256 South St. Lawrence.
Get the C.P.D. over there.
We got a car there now.
Get some shots of that.
Fredrick Sykes...
...45, ex-cop, and quite a clotheshorse.
You want to look at this?
Kimble's prints. They're all over...
...but mainly on the desk.
He sure had some interest
in these photographs.
Negatives in there?
Let me have them.
<i>- Camera boy's on his way.</i>
- We got you.
How're you, Mr. Sykes?
- Fine, if you tell me what's happening.
- We had a problem.
- My place or the place upstairs?
- Your place.
Step right in, Mr. Sykes.
Everybody knows my name here.
Big happy family, huh?
What is this, a trench coat
convention? What's going on?
Who are you guys? What's going on?
You had a break-in, Mr. Sykes.
I sure hope you're a cop.
No, I'm Samuel Gerard,
United States Marshal's office.
This morning a fugitive named Richard
Kimble made a phone call from here.
Why would he do that?
I don't know any Richard Kimble.
Okay, I got it.
The doctor who killed his wife, right?
Blamed somebody with a prosthetic.
Is he coming after me?
Does he have reason to do so?
I have a prosthetic arm!
I must've done it!
Give me a break. I went
through all this a year ago.
I was questioned here
about the whole thing.
I told them I wasn't in Chicago that
night. I was away on business.
15 people verified it.
What line of business are you in?
Security.
- Who do you work for?
- A pharmaceutical company.
Which one?
Devlin MacGregor. I handle
security for the top executives.
Any idea why Kimble would be
interested in these photographs?
No.
Where were they taken?
That's a big fish!
Cancun, Mexico.
It was a junket the company
paid for some doctors.
- Kimble go with you?
- You don't see him there, do you?
No. I told you I don't know him.
Mind if I check to see
if anything's missing?
I don't mind.
How'd you lose that arm?
In the line of duty.
Cosmo, this guy's dirty.
Yes, he is.
- You want our people on him?
- Yes. Build a camp here.
I'll take care of it.
See this picture? I want you to find
out who's the guy next to Sykes.
Find out his name, age, weight,
social security number...
...his location, relatives,
pets, everything.
Sorry, doctor, they said
it was an emergency.
Excuse me.
<i>Mr. Bolton.</i>
Chuck.
<i>Richard.</i>
Can you talk?
Yes, I'm on a hotel phone.
How are you? What's going on?
I found him. I found
the man who killed Helen.
It was me they were after.
Who are they?
Devlin MacGregor and Lentz.
Lentz was supervising
the protocol for RDU-90.
He knew it was causing liver damage.
It was Lentz.
Richard, Lentz is dead.
How?
<i>He died in a car accident last summer.</i>
Can you prove this about the drug?
I think so.
I need your help.
Call Bones at the hospital.
Tell him to give me any help I need.
I'll call him now.
Okay. Thanks.
Dr. Nichols!
Can we ask you a few more questions?
Mr. Gerard.
You got a copy of that photograph?
U.S. Marshal Service.
Excuse us.
This is Fredrick Sykes.
He's a security specialist at
Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.
Richard Kimble broke into his apartment.
Do you know this man?
No, I don't.
You're getting pretty desperate,
aren't you, Mr. Gerard?
Oh, yes.
I told you you wouldn't find Richard.
Has he been to see you?
We've been over this
ground before, haven't we?
So, if you'll excuse me.
- Thanks, Doc.
- Thank you, Doctor.
Sorry. One more question
about the photograph.
See the guy standing on
the right side of the fish?
Ever see him before?
This guy right here?
I've never seen that person before.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you, Doctor. Enjoy
the rest of the convention.
"Alternatives to Cardio-Non-Invasive
Arterial Plaque-Reducing Therapy.
Keynote speaker, Charles Nichols."
Bet they line up for this one.
If you were Richard Kimble...
...why would you hunt for a one-armed
man you say killed your wife...
...break into his house,
call us up and then split?
I should have been a doctor.
Look at this blow-up. This guy in
the picture with Sykes. On his shirt.
Chicago Memorial.
I want to go there.
Go!
Wait.
Devlin MacGregor...
...did 7 1/2 billion
dollars in net sales...
...last year alone.
That company's a monster.
Talk to me.
Absolutely.
It's a liver sample...
...from a patient on
the RDU-90 drug study.
January 21st?
The last one!
1-7-4-3-0?
1-7-4-3-0. You got it.
Thanks. I'll make sure
all this gets back to you.
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you.
Whatever happened to that
thing with your wife?
It's not over yet.
What's going on?
How should I know?
I think his name is Alec Lentz.
A pathologist.
I remember because he died last summer.
Oh, my God. Richard!
What are you doing here?
Hi, Kath.
Have a look.
- What do you think?
- Cold normal.
Clearly not the same tissue.
And not only did they all
come from healthy livers...
...they came from the same liver.
Kath, you beauty.
Excuse me.
Mr. Roosevelt?
We're deputies Biggs and Newman.
We're U.S. Marshals.
Need some information
about a Dr. Lentz who was on staff here.
Did he know or have any contact
with a Dr. Richard Kimble?
I haven't seen Dr. Kimble.
I didn't ask that.
I wouldn't know.
If you'll excuse me, I have
prior obligations to attend to.
I think you're lying to us.
Lentz is the bad guy?
Yeah, why not?
He was one of the original
patent holders in RDU-90.
I was sending in my tissue samples...
...he was replacing them with healthy
samples, issuing path reports...
...shit-canning my stuff. Easy.
Wait a minute.
Lentz died August 21st.
Half the samples he approved
were signed the day he died.
You're kidding.
Someone else must have
been manipulating this.
Someone with access.
Thanks, Kath.
Where are you going?
To see a friend.
This is giving me a headache.
That's surprising. Where did
Roosevelt say Kimble was going?
He says he doesn't know.
- Do you believe him?
<i>- Yes, I do.</i>
<i>He says he picked up tissue samples...</i>
<i>...for a drug study.</i>
Get this:
The release was approved
by Dr. Charles Nichols.
<i>Nichols also knew Lentz.</i>
<i>He was Lentz's boss.</i>
He was covering for Kimble.
Send the C.P.D. there right now.
We're sending cops. Make sure
they turn that place inside out.
Don't let them give you shit
about your ponytail. Well done.
My pleasure.
Dr. Nichols lied to me.
- Go find him.
- I'm on it.
Okay, it's gone by now.
I looked every place you told
me and I didn't see him.
I'm telling you.
If he was in the hospital,
I would have found him.
What do you want me to do?
Hold on. Wait a minute.
I marked him. I got him now.
Dr. Alexander Lentz.
"A noted pathologist at
Chicago Memorial Hospital..."
"...was walking to his daily tennis
match when an unidentified vehicle..."
"...slammed his body..."
"...into the barriers separating
the Drive from Lake Michigan."
You won't believe this.
Sykes' records for the past 2 years
show no calls to Kimble.
It was a thought.
But when I cross-checked
Kimble's records, one came up.
Kimble called Sykes...
Get Sykes in here now.
...on the night of the murder...
...7:30 P.M...
...from his car phone.
Do you have Kimble's arrest report?
- 7:30 P.M.
- 19:30 hours.
They just went in. Sykes is gone.
He's nowhere to be found.
He's gone.
Possible sighting of Richard Kimble on
northbound El coming into Van Buren.
Move to the door.
<i>Next stop, Balbo Station. Balbo.</i>
This is my stop.
My stop too.
You missed your stop.
A transit cop saw Kimble on
the El, heading toward Balbo.
The C.P.D. is on the way.
<i>Attention all units. Transit police
report officer down at Balbo Station.</i>
<i>Kimble is suspect.</i>
What'd he do, shoot a cop?
Chicago P.D. will eat him alive.
It is a joy and a privilege...
...to introduce tonight's
keynote speaker.
For the past 4 years...
...he has served
as the A. Jude Robinson Fellow...
...and administrative
Chief of Pathology...
...at Chicago Memorial Hospital.
Where are the emergency exits?
<i>Suspect seen entering Hilton Tower Mall,
lower level.</i>
You don't think...
I know where he's going.
Biggs, Newman, where are you?
He was appointed to the Board of Directors
of Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.
<i>Will you please welcome...</i>
...Dr. Charles Nichols.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen...
...friends and colleagues.
<i>It's great you're all here tonight.</i>
C.P.D. reported an officer
down and a guy with 2 guns...
- Kimble do it?
- Conflicting reports.
He entered the hotel from the subway.
- That's my man!
- Not anymore.
He's going down.
You can help by staying out.
Arrest us!
Lock it up! Start at the lower level.
<i>All units report when
lower level is secure.</i>
<i>All units, secure all lower level exits.</i>
Find the hotel security office.
Stay in touch with me by radio.
Now, a new drug...
...on the cusp of approval by the
Food and Drug Administration...
...is poised to change
these old methods forever.
Deputy Newman, U.S. Marshal's Service.
Sam, I'm in.
...through the normal metabolic
pathways in the liver.
The drug's name is...
...Provasic.
As I will show you tonight...
...Provasic is remarkably effective...
...and has no side effects whatsoever.
It is also noteworthy that this drug...
This drug was developed...
...in cooperation, not competition,
with Chicago Memorial Hospital...
...in what we hope will be...
...the model for a
continued dishonest...
...excuse me, honest...
...open joint ventures...
...between academic medicine...
...and the pharmaceutical...
Richard!
I'm sorry, I'm in the
middle of this speech.
You almost got away with it.
I know all about it.
I can prove it.
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend
Richard Kimble doesn't feel well...
...obviously...
...so just go on with your
dessert and coffee...
Richard, do you mind stepping
aside and let's talk.
So I'll be back in just a second.
You changed the samples, didn't you?
You switched the samples...
...after Lentz died.
Let's stay calm, people.
After Lentz died, you were
the only one who had access.
You switched the samples...
...and the pathology reports.
You killed Lentz?
Call Security.
Did you?
He falsified his research...
...so RDU-90 could be...
...approved and...
...Devlin MacGregor
could give you Provasic.
It's all over, folks.
Just stay calm.
You never give up, do you?
You never give up!
Why Helen?
Glad you're here.
Which way'd they go?
- Toward the Presidential Suite.
- Where's that?
- Southeast corner.
- How many exits are there from this room?
Four: 2 on the east, 2 on the west.
Kimble's on the roof!
Cosmo, that way.
Stop! Stay where you are!
This is the Chicago police!
Put your hands in the air!
The building is totally secure.
I repeat, do not move!
Put your hands in the air!
Stay where you are!
Talk to me.
They're headed to the
north end of the roof.
Newman!
Get that helicopter out of here!
As soon as you get a clean shot...
...take him out.
Get rid of the helicopter!
<i>- Why?</i>
- Because I don't want to get shot!
C.P.D., there's a U.S. Marshal
on the roof. Hold your fire!
<i>Call off the helicopter!</i>
Don't shoot.
This guy ever quit?
Find out where that elevator stops.
Northwest elevator! Where does it stop?
Where did they go? Where did they go?
- Stopped on the 5th floor.
- They're on the 5th floor.
- What's on the 5th floor?
- The laundry.
<i>They stopped at the laundry.</i>
We're on the 5th floor. What's your 20?
Right behind you.
What's going on here?
We must keep the C.P.D. out.
They're too hot for me.
Get rid of all these people.
Okay, people, stay calm.
Cosmo, come with me.
Dr. Richard Kimble!
There's no way out of here!
The entire building is locked down!
Give it up, you don't have any time!
Chicago Police thinks
you're a cop killer!
They will shoot you on sight!
I know you're innocent!
I know about Fredrick Sykes!
I know about Dr. Charles Nichols!
He borrowed your car the
night of your wife's murder!
He had the keys!
No forced entry.
He telephoned Sykes
from your car, Richard!
Give it up!
I'm either lying to you or
I'm going to shoot you!
What do you think?
Give it up! It's time to stop running!
They killed my wife.
I know it.
But it's over now.
You know, I'm glad.
I need the rest.
Who killed Kimble's wife?
Kimble was convicted of it.
You've got a one-armed man in custody.
- Is that the guy?
- I have no idea.
How many one-armed men are there?
There're a lot of them.
Could you have made a mistake?
The one-armed man is also there. I've never
seen so much since I've been around here.
You got a deadline,
play the weather again.
Tell Samuel Gerard I'm going home now.
I'm taking my vacation.
Clear this area. Everybody clear.
Watch your head.
Where is that thing?
Let me see those hands, Doctor.
I thought you didn't care.
I don't.
Don't tell anybody, okay?
