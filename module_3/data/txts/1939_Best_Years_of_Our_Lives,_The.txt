WOMAN [OVER PA]:
<i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>Announcing the departure of
American Airlines westbound Flight 9.</i>
<i>Flight 9 now loading at Gate 3
for immediate departure.</i>
WOMAN: Yes, sir?
- You got anything going to Boone City?
Boone City, three daily flights,
but there's no space available.
- Would you care to make a reservation?
- Yes, I would.
- Your name, please?
- Derry. D-E-R-R-Y. Fred.
How long will it be?
We can probably get you
on Flight 37 on the 19th.
The 19th?
See, listen, I can't wait that long.
I just got back from oversea.
I wanna get home.
I'm sorry. There's a waiting list.
My secretary made arrangements
to have my tickets here.
My name is Gibbons.
George H. Gibbons.
- Yes, they're right here.
- Thank you.
- May we weigh your baggage, please?
- Yes, uh, excuse me.
- Put them right there, please.
- Sorry.
You might try the ATC, Captain.
ATC, where are they?
Out the terminal
to your right and across the field.
Thanks.
You have 16 pounds excess baggage,
Mr. Gibbons.
Oh, that's all right. How much is it?
[CHATTERING]
SERGEANT:
Right-o, sir.
At ease, men.
Flight 93. Flight 93. For Denver,
San Francisco and Seattle.
That flight has been canceled
until further notice.
[ALL GROAN AND CHATTER]
SERGEANT: Yeah.
- You got anything for Detroit?
- Nope, how about Cleveland?
- Cleveland?
Okay.
- Fill this out.
- Guess I'm going to Cleveland.
-It's a nice town.
- Yeah, but Detroit's where I live.
Sarge, what's the chances
of a ride to Boone City?
You got orders?
- Sure.
- Okay.
I haven't got anything now, but fill this out,
I'll call you if anything comes up.
Okay, I guess I'll wait.
Guys, I need a couple of men
to give me a hand with this out to a plane.
- Okay.
- Hey, come on. Let's go.
Let's go, huh?
I bet this thing weighs a ton.
What's the matter, sailor?
Tired or something?
Okay, let's go. Out this way.
MAN 1:
Fellas, take it easy down the stairs.
MAN 2: Got it?
MAN 3: Yeah.
MAN 1:
There you go. Hey, look out, fellas.
- Take it easy going down the stairs.
MAN 4: Oh, my aching back.
SERGEANT:
Derry.
- Derry. Captain Fred Derry.
FRED: Oh! Coming.
- Parrish. Homer Parrish.
HOMER: Here.
- You Derry?
- Yeah.
- Parrish?
HOMER: Right.
Got a call from Baseops.
There's a B-17 taking off for Boone City.
You'll have a long ride.
She's making a lot of stops.
You'll get there tomorrow. That suit you?
- Sure, that's swell.
- Okay, sign here.
Boy, it sure is great to be going home.
- Here you go, sailor.
- Sign on the dotted...
I'll do it for you.
What's the matter?
Think I can't spell my own name?
No, I-- I just thought that...
I know, sarge. Thanks.
Hey, Joe. You better hurry up out there,
because she's taking off soon.
Right, thanks. Come on, sailor.
- Where's your stuff?
- Right here.
Excuse us, corporal.
- Boone City your home, sailor?
- Yes, sir, captain.
FRED:
Forget the rank, chum. I'm out.
- Whereabouts do you live in Boone?
- Over on West 17th Street.
- You know where Jackson High is?
- Sure.
- Go ahead.
- Well, it's just a couple of blocks past it.
- Hi, sarge.
- How are you?
FRED: My name's Fred Derry.
AL: Al Stephenson.
- And this is Homer... What is it, Homer?
- Parrish.
- Glad to know you.
- Glad to know you, sarge.
- You from Boone too?
- Yeah, sure I am.
- How long since you've been home?
- Oh, a couple of centuries.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
We'll sit in the radio compartment
until the takeoff...
...then we'll get in the nose
and get a nice view of the good old U.S.A.
AL:
Okay.
HOMER: Boy, oh, boy. Hey, look at that.
Look at those automobiles down there.
You can see them so plain,
you can even see the people in them.
FRED:
Yeah, looks like we're flying by road map.
- Is this your first ride in one of these?
- Heh, yeah, this is my first plane ride.
I saw plenty of flying, all right.
I was on a CV. That's a flattop.
But I never knew things
looked so pretty from up here.
Sure is beautiful.
I never thought so.
This used to be my office.
- Bombardier, weren't you?
- Yeah.
That's where the bombsight was.
I spent a lot of time on my knees
up there.
- Praying?
- Heh, yeah, that too.
- Cigarette, Homer?
- Thanks. It's all right, I can get it.
Here, I've got a match, captain.
FRED:
Thanks.
- Thank you.
- Anybody superstitious?
- No, no, go ahead.
- Well, I am.
[FRED AND HOMER CHUCKLE]
Boy, you ought to see
me open a bottle of beer.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
- Well, then you got nothing to worry about.
HOMER: Thanks.
I guess you saw a lot of action.
No, I didn't see much of the war.
I mean, the way you fellas did.
You trying to kid the Army?
No, I was stationed
in the repair shop below decks.
Oh, I was in plenty of battles.
But I never saw a Jap
or heard a shell coming at me.
When we were sunk, all I know
is there was a lot of fire and explosions.
And I was ordered topsides and overboard,
and I was burned.
When I came to,
I was on a cruiser and my hands were off.
After that, I had it easy.
- Easy?
- That's what I said.
They took care of me fine.
They trained me to use these things.
I can dial telephones, I can drive a car,
I can even put nickels in a jukebox.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
I'm all right. But, uh...
But what, sailor?
Well...
Well, you see, I've got a girl.
She knows what happened to you,
doesn't she?
Sure. They all know.
But they don't know
what these things look like.
- What's your girl's name, Homer?
- Wilma.
She and I went to high school together.
- I bet Wilma's a swell girl.
- She is.
And it'll be all right, sailor.
You wait and see.
Yeah. Wait and see.
Wilma's only a kid.
She's never seen anything
like these hooks.
Say, heh, wait till I get home
and tell the folks about this trip.
I'm the first one in my family
that ever rode in an aeroplane.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
- Hey, Al.
- Yeah?
You remember what it felt like
when you went overseas?
As well as I remember my own name.
I feel the same way now.
Only more so.
I know what you mean.
Just nervous out of the service,
l guess,heh.
The thing that scares me most is that
everybody's gonna try to rehabilitate me.
All I want's a good job, a mild future...
...and a house big enough for me
and my wife.
Give me that much
and I'm rehabilitated like that.
I'd say that's not too much to ask.
You married, Al?
- Yep.
- How long?
Twenty years.
Twenty years?
Heh, holy smoke.
We didn't even have 20 days
before I went over.
I married a girl I met
when I was in training in Texas.
You and your wife will
have a chance to get acquainted, huh?
Yeah, heh.
I wonder how
Homer will make out with that girl of his.
Wilma.
I hope Wilma is a swell girl.
FRED:
The old hometown hasn't changed much.
AL:
No.
There's the golf course.
People are playing golf.
Just as if nothing had ever happened.
Hey, there's Jackson High football field.
Boy, I sure would like to have a dollar
for every forward pass I threw down there.
Good old Jackson High.
- Hey, that must be the new airport.
- Yeah, we're turning into it now.
Holy smoke.
[AL WHISTLES]
HOMER:
I never knew there were so many planes.
FRED:
And they're junking them.
HOMER: What?
AL: No.
Boy,oh,boy.
What we could have done
with those in '43.
AL:
Yeah, I'll bet.
FRED: Some of them look brand new.
From the factory to the scrapheap.
That's all they're good for now.
We gotta get out of the nose
while he sets her down.
Hey, look, there's the ballpark.
Say, how are the Beavers
doing this season?
Uh, they're in sixth place.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
Still in second division.
- Hey, there's Butch's Place.
- Butch's?
- Who's that?
- Gosh, Butch has got himself a neon sign.
- Have you ever been to Butch's?
- No.
Oh, Butch Engle that runs it, he's my uncle.
Swell guy.
Only the family don't think
he's respectable because he sells liquor.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
- That's the best joint in town.
- We'll have to get together there.
Swell.
This is my street.
DRIVER:
Fifteen, 17.
HOMER:
It's the fourth house from here.
I wonder if Wilma's home.
Say, how about the three of us
going back to Butch's Place?
We'll have a couple of drinks
and then we can go home.
You're home now, kid.
- Well, so long.
AL & FRED: So long, Homer.
DRIVER: Where next?
- Just a minute, bud.
It's Homer! Momma! Momma! Daddy!
It's Homer! Homer's here!
Wilma! Wilma! Homer's here!
Wilma, come on over!
Oh.
MRS. PARRISH:
Oh, Homer.
MR. PARRISH: My boy.
MRS. PARRISH: on, darling.
MR. PARRISH: It's good to see you.
MRS. PARRISH: Oh, oh.
[MRS. PARRISH LAUGHING]
MRS. PARRISH: Isn't this wonderful?
LUELLA: There's Wilma.
Okay, let's go.
- Well...
- No, don't. I'll carry it.
[MRS. PARRISH SOBS]
What's the matter, Ma?
It's nothing.
It's just that your ma's
so glad to see you home.
Yeah, I know.
[SOBBING]
You gotta hand it to the Navy.
They sure trained that kid
how to use those hooks.
They couldn't train him to put
his arms around his girl, to stroke her hair.
- Is it the next turn up here?
- Yeah, the next turn on the left.
Hey, Fred, uh, why don't we drop you first?
No, you're next.
And we're not going back to Butch's
for a drink, either.
Feel as if I were going in to hit a beach.
Some barracks you got here.
Hey, what are you, a retired bootlegger?
Nothing as dignified as that.
I'm a banker.
How much do I owe you?
Take your hand out of your pocket,
sergeant. You're outranked.
Yes, sir, captain, sir.
- Good luck, chum.
- Thanks.
CLERK:
Yes, I will. Yes, sir.
One moment, please.
Uh, one moment, please.
- Just whom do you wish to see?
- Mrs. Stephenson.
Well, just a minute.
I'll have to announce you first.
You put that phone down.
I'm her husband.
- You're Mr. Stephenson?
- Sergeant Stephenson.
What did you expect?
A four-star general?
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
Yes, sir.
- Fourth floor.
- Yes, sir.
[BUZZES]
ROB:
I'll get it, Peg.
AL:
Shh.
Where's Mom?
-Da--
AL: Shh.
MILLY:
Who's that at the door, Peggy?
Peggy-
Rob, who was--?
- I look terrible.
- Who says so?
- It isn't fair of you to bust in on us like this.
- I phoned you from Portland.
Yes, but you said
you wouldn't be home for--
We were lucky.
We got a plane to Welburn.
I thought we were gonna get stuck there,
but we came right through.
- Al, are you all right?
- Sure.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, of course I am.
- Let me look at you.
- Don't look now, I need a bath and a shave.
PEGGY:
If you don't mind, Mom.
Dad. Darling.
I'd better call the Kenworthys
and tell them we won't be over.
- The Kenworthys?
- Yes.
My son, heh, and my daughter.
I don't recognize you. What's happened?
Just a few years of normal growth.
Don't you approve?
I don't know yet.
I've gotta have more time
to get to know you.
MILLY:
Hello?
Oh, Alice, this is Milly.
I'm terribly sorry, but we can't be over.
[CHUCKLES]
I mean, I'm terribly happy.
[CHUCKLES]
You see, Al...
My husband.
Yes. He's home. Yes.
Yes.
- Freddy.
- Hello, Hortense.
Well, say. Oh. Pat.
Pat, it's Freddy. He's home again.
Hello, Pop.
Gee, I wish we'd known
you were coming.
We'd have had
the place kind of cleaned up.
Well, haven't you got anything to say
to your own son?
- Glad to see you, my boy.
- Look at him, Pat.
Look at your hero son.
And look at all those
beautiful ribbons on his chest.
Go on, Freddy, tell your father how you
got those ribbons and what they mean.
- Where's Marie?
- Marie?
Yeah, she out?
- Oh, Marie isn't here, Freddy.
- Will she be back soon?
Well, she's not living with us anymore,
Freddy. She took an apartment downtown.
Why didn't anybody write me about it?
Well, we were afraid it might worry you,
you being so far away.
And it was inconvenient for Marie
living in this place after she took that job.
But, uh, we forwarded all your letters
and the allotment checks.
She took a job? Where?
Uh, some nightclub.
I don't know just which one.
Oh, the poor girl works till all hours.
- Where does she live?
- Um...
Grandview Arms on Pine Street.
But there's nothing to worry about, Freddy.
Marie's fine.
We saw her last Christmas.
She brought us some beautiful presents.
Marie's a good-hearted girl.
You know what time
she goes out to work?
Um, well, about, uh, suppertime, I imagine.
Do you mind if I leave my stuff here?
I'll pick it up later.
Sure, but aren't you gonna stay
and have a bite to eat?
No, thank you, Hortense.
Well, uh...
So long, Pop. I'll be back.
Well, it's...
I'm glad to have you home, my boy.
It's good to be home, Pop. Bye.
AL:
Here, a cap.
Here's a samurai sword, Rob.
Thanks very much, Dad.
And here's a flag
I found on a dead Jap soldier.
All that writing on it are signatures
and good luck messages from his relatives.
Yes, I know.
The Japanese attach a lot of importance
to their family relationship.
Yeah. Yeah, entirely different from us.
- Say, you were at Hiroshima, weren't you, Dad?
- Mm-hm.
Did you happen to notice...
...any of the effects of radioactivity
on the people who survived the blast?
No, I didn't. Should I have?
Well, we've been having lectures
in atomic energy at school.
And Mr. McLaglen,
he's our physics teacher...
...he says that we've reached the point...
...where the whole human race has either
got to find a way to live together...
-...or else, um...
- Or else.
That's right. Or else.
Because when you combine
atomic energy with jet propulsion...
...and radar and guided missiles,
well, just think of the...
Oh, heh, you're just kidding me, Dad.
You've been to all these places
and you've seen everything.
I've seen nothing.
I should have stayed home
and found out what was really going on.
I finished the dishes.
Why do you have to do that?
Is this the maid's night out?
[PEGGY CHUCKLES]
Our maid took a night out
three years ago, we haven't seen her since.
But everything's all right because
I took a course in domestic science.
- Even bought a cook book.
- What's happened to this family?
All this atomic energy
and scientific efficiency.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
It was the war. You heard about that.
AL:
Yeah.
All those problems on the home front.
We <i>used to read about them
in Stars and Stripes.</i>
We felt awfully sorry for the civilians.
You don't have to worry about us, Dad.
We can handle the problems.
We're tough.
[AL CHUCKLES]
Rob, haven't you any homework?
Oh, sure. Good night, Dad.
Don't see why you have to go now.
Rob, aren't you going to take
the souvenirs father brought you?
Oh, yes.
Gee, thanks an awful lot, Dad,
for these things.
Good night. See you in the morning.
AL:
Good night, Rob.
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, darling.
Nice to have you around, Dad.
You'll get us back to normal.
Or maybe go nuts myself.
What do you think of the children?
The children?
I don't recognize them.
They've grown so old.
I tried to stop them...
...to keep them just as they were
when you left, but they got away from me.
- I guess, uh, Peggy has a lot of boyfriends.
- She's very popular.
Is she concentrating
on anyone particular?
She hasn't told me of anyone.
But you've, uh...
...told her all the things
she ought to know?
What, for instance?
Well, have you?
She's worked two years in a hospital.
She knows more than you or I ever will.
Cigarette?
- Have you forgotten, Al? I don't smoke.
- Oh, sorry.
It's all right, darling.
-It's frightening.
- What is?
Youth.
Didn't you run across any young people
in the Army?
- No, they were all old men like me.
- Yes.
It's terrible to be old, isn't it?
- Why don't you sit down and relax?
- I'm perfectly relaxed standing up.
Is there such a thing as a drink
in this house?
I'll see.
PEGGY: We haven't got enough bacon
for Dad's breakfast.
I'll go out first thing in the morning
and get some.
Is this all the liquor we have left?
Gosh, I'm afraid so.
I wish he'd given us some warning
he was going to get here today.
Don't worry, Mom.
I mean so that we could have gotten in
some supplies of things.
Mother.
I know it's a little difficult...
...but that's only because Dad's so crazy
about you.
He's been away so long
and missed you so terribly.
He can't just walk in
and immediately pick up the old life as if--
Hey, I got a wonderful idea.
Let's go out on the town, the three of us.
- Tonight?
- Yes, tonight. Right now.
We'll celebrate
the old man's homecoming.
- Not me. I'm going to bed.
- No. You too. The three of us.
I wanna do something, see something.
And I've been in jungles
and around savages so long...
...I gotta find out
I'm back in civilization again.
[BAND PLAYING SWING MUSIC]
[WOMAN SINGING]
[BAND PLAYING JAZZ MUSIC]
Hey, Rupert,
how about another one here?
[PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC]
Well, I'll tell you...
...as I see it, we're headed
for bad times in this country.
Of course, we're in the backwash
of the war boom now...
...but the tide is running out fast.
Next year, in my opinion, we'll see
widespread depression and unemployment.
Oh, have a cigar?
No, thanks. I've got my pipe.
Homer? Didn't you contract
the tobacco habit in the Navy?
Just cigarettes, Mr. Cameron. Thanks.
Wilma tells us
you were in the Philippines, Homer.
Well, I was around there, Mrs. Cameron,
but I never saw anything.
- Did you meet General MacArthur?
- Heh, no, I didn't get to meet him.
Uh, I've got a light, Mr. Cameron.
No, that's all right, uh...
...got it.
MR. PARRISH: Luella.
- Yes, Dad?
You know, I've always thought
he's such a handsome man, heh.
- Who?
- General MacArthur.
[MRS. CAMERON CHUCKLES]
- May I help you with that, Mrs. Parrish?
- No, Wilma, you sit right down.
- Lemonade, Mrs. Cameron?
- Thank you very much.
Have you thought anything
about getting a job, Homer?
- Well, I...
- Oh, Father...
...it's much too soon for Homer
to be thinking about a job.
He's just out of the hospital.
Yes, I know...
...but a few months from now, the same
opportunities won't exist that exist today.
You might think about my business, Homer.
Insurance.
We've taken on a number of veterans.
They make good salesmen, you know.
Men who have suffered
from some kind of disability.
Come down to the office one of these days,
we'll talk it over.
MRS. PARRISH: Oh.
- I'm sorry, Mom.
Oh, that-- That's quite all right, Homer.
It won't hurt the carpet a bit.
Luella, you skin out to the kitchen
and get me a dishrag.
There's another one for you, Homer.
Wilma will hold it for you.
No, thanks.
If you don't mind,
I think I'll go out and walk around a bit.
LUELLA:
Where's Homer?
He went out.
<i>[SINGING]
It's home, boys, home</i>
<i>Home, we ought to be</i>
<i>Home, boys, home
Back in God's country</i>
Pick Up Cafe. There it is, driver.
Stop right here.
Listen, Al, all kidding aside.
Don't you think
it's time to get some sleep?
Absolutely. Sleep. But first we've gotta
stop and have one last little drink.
And that's all you're gonna get.
No arguments. One drink.
Come on in, driver,
and have one with us.
[UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]
BUTCH:
Hey, Homer.
Oh, it's good to see you, kid.
Gee. Your friendly captain told me
you were home, but I didn't expect you--
Hi, captain!
Hey, Homer, my old shipmate.
Heh, how are you kid? Sit down.
So you took my advice?
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's have a drink.
STEVE: Hello, Homer.
- Hi, Steve.
Boy, am I happy
to see you back home again.
Go ahead, shake, pal. It won't bite you.
[STEVE AND HOMER CHUCKLE]
- What'll you have?
- What'll I have?
How many times have I dreamed
of hearing that question?
Before I went in the Navy,
Butch would never let me drink any liquor.
He used to read me lectures
on the curse of drink.
But it's different now. I'm a veteran.
Give me a whiskey, Steve. Straight.
How about it, Butch?
Draw a beer for the Navy.
- Butch, I ordered whiskey.
- Been
Been
I'm gonna take my trade to some other joint
where I don't have relatives.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
Say, what are you doing here, anyway?
Why aren't you home with the folks?
Well, they went to bed
and I wasn't sleepy...
...so I thought,
"Why not come down and see Butch?"
Glad you did, Homer.
[HOMER CLEARS THROAT]
Well, here's to you, Butch.
How am I doing?
- Kid, you're doing great.
- Thanks.
Say, Fred, where did you leave Al?
Oh, Al. He's home in the swankiest
apartment house in town.
We'll never see him again.
- Say, this is the best place we've been yet.
HOMER: Hey, that's Al.
[ALL LAUGHING]
FRED: Where you been?
We were just talking about you.
AL:
Oh, my aching back.
Hey, Milly. Peggy.
Step up and meet the gang.
This is Homer, this is Fred.
This is my wife and daughter.
Homer and I were together at the Battle
of Lingayen Gulf, only we didn't know it.
[AL AND HOMER CHUCKLE]
- Hi, bub.
- How do you do?
- Al, this is my Uncle Butch.
-Bu--
Oh, I hear you got a new neon sign, huh?
Good for you.
Now the party can really get started.
Oh, this better, eh?
Let's sit. Milly, come on.
Here's a good booth.
Fred, come on, sit down.
Hey, Fred, where's your wife, huh?
I wanna meet her.
I haven't been able to find her.
She works in some nightclub.
I've been around places looking--
Well, we'll find her, Fred,
before this night is out.
We'll deploy our forces
and comb the town. Won't we, Milly?
Oh, by all means.
Well, we got the Navy to convoy us, huh?
We gotta get one thing straight.
Homer lost his hands.
He's got those hooks.
They don't worry him...
...so they don't need to worry anybody.
Right?
- Right.
- Right, now let's get seriously to work.
FRED: Uh-huh.
- Telephone, Butch.
Thank you. Give them anything they want.
- Any kind of beer.
AL: Mm-hm.
- What'll it be?
- How are you, Angus?
- Hi, sergeant. Hello.
- Nice to see you.
- Looking well. A little gray.
FRED: Hi, Angus.
ANGUS:
Yeah,yeah.
- Well, uh, cheers, cheers.
- Cheers.
Homer.
HOMER:
Okay, Butch.
Aren't you drinking?
[MELLOW PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]
HOMER: Excuse me, folks.
AL: Sure, Homer.
Gee, Butch, it's swell
to hear you playing again.
How about "Lazy River"?
Remember that?
Sit down, Homer.
Wilma phoned.
Wilma?
- What did she want?
- You.
Oh, why can't they leave a guy alone?
Because they're fond of you, that's why.
What made you leave the house
and get them all worried?
Oh, they...
- They got me nervous.
- How?
Butch, it's nothing.
I don't wanna talk about it.
How'd they get you nervous?
Well, they...
Well, they keep staring at these hooks...
...or else they keep staring
away from them.
You mean whatever they do is wrong.
Why don't they understand that all I want
is to be treated like everybody else?
Take Pop for instance.
He was cleaning his pipe
like I've seen him do a million times.
And all of a sudden he got conscious
that he had hands and I didn't and he...
He stopped cleaning his pipe
and he tried to hide his hands...
...like he was guilty or something.
Give them time, kid. They'll catch on.
You know, your folks will get used to you
and you'll get used to them.
Then everything will settle down nicely.
Unless we have another war.
Then none of us have to worry, because
we'll all be blown to bits the first day.
So cheer up, huh?
Hey, Butch.
You know "Among My Souvenirs," huh?
[AL HUMMING]
Shh, shh.
[BUTCH PLAYING "AMONG MY SOUVENIRS"]
Shall we dance?
Well, that's a charming idea.
Do you remember this tune?
Nice to see the young folks
enjoying themselves, isn't it?
So you're Al's daughter.
Heh, yes. I've been that
as long as I can remember.
You don't seem like Al's daughter.
Actually, I'm not.
He's my son by a previous marriage.
[CHUCKLES]
- What did you say your name was?
439993!-
- Peggy, my name's Fred. How do you do?
- Heh, how do you do?
[ALL APPLAUDING]
Oh, no, you don't. Oh, no.
[UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]
You know,
you're a bewitching little creature.
In a way, you remind me of my wife.
- But you never told me you're married.
- Oh, yeah.
I've got a little woman and two kiddies
back there in the States.
- But let's not think of them now.
- Oh, you're so right.
This night belongs only to us.
That's the type of thing people ought
to be thinking about these days.
All right, I promise I'll get right to work
on it.
And there's one thing
I've been wanting to ask you.
You ask it, Peggy.
You mustn't feel shy with me.
Why don't you call your wife?
I don't know her number.
- I couldn't find it in the phone book.
AL: Phone book!
We don't need to do any telephoning.
We're all set, ha, ha.
What you need is a drink.
[AL WHISTLES]
Good night, everybody. I'm going home.
- Why?
- I've gotta. Butch says I've gotta.
- He's gonna drive me.
- Oh, no, no.
- But you can't. No, you can't...
-it's quite all right.
And don't any of you leave. I'll be back.
- Good night, everybody.
ALL: Good night.
Poor kid. Imagine, he's gotta go home.
- Doesn't that put any ideas in your head?
- Yes.
[AL WHISTLES]
I'd love to.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
BUTCH:
Lights out, Steve.
[AL LAUGHS]
- Uh, where do we go next, old pal, old pal?
- Just follow me, old pal.
AL:
Mm-hm.
MILLY:
Step.
- Good night, Al.
AL: Good night, Butch. Been a nice party.
PEGGY:
This it, Fred?
It looks like it.
Silly.
Good night, Milly. Many thanks
for a most enjoyable evening.
- Good night, Fred.
- Good night, Al.
Best of luck to you.
I'll give him your message.
Hey, you do that.
And good night to you, Peggy.
- It has indeed been a great pleasure.
- Yes, Fred. See you soon.
By all means.
MILLY:
Ooh.
Heh, I beg your pardon.
Good night.
We'd better wait and see if he gets in.
PEGGY: I don't think he even knows
if this is the right place.
PEGGY:
Come on.
Up.
Where are we all going now?
Don't ask. We want it to be a surprise.
Heh, they make a lovely couple, don't they?
[PEGGY CHUCKLES]
Yeah, I think they'll be very happy together.
[CAR STARTS]
Who are you?
Don't you remember?
I'm Peggy-
Oh, yes. Peggy.
Heh, I'm not that Peggy.
That's too bad.
[AL HUMMING]
[SNEEZES]
[MILLY GRUNTS]
As I remember, when you lie flat
on your back, you snore.
Here. Where's your hand?
Here.
Give me your hand.
[AL MUMBLING]
- Is Fred all right?
- Yes. He's all right.
- You'll be comfortable here.
- Sure, Mom. Night.
Night, dear.
[BOTH LAUGH]
MILLY:
Night.
PEGGY:
Night.
Get out of there.
[MUMBLING]
Got a turnaround at 4 o'clock.
It's all over.
You got him.
He's hit.
[PANTING]
She's on fire.
The fire's spreading.
It's Gadorsky.
There goes number four.
She's breaking formation.
Watch out for fighters.
It's spread to the wing.
The Wing's on fire.
She's out of control.
She's going down.
Hey, you guys, jump!
Get out of there. Bail out!
Gadorsky.
Gadorsky, get out of that plane!
Two chutes open.
Three.
Come on, the rest of you guys.
- Fred.
- Come on, get out!
- Fred, wake up. Wake up.
- Gadorsky!
- Gadorsky! She's burning up!
- Wake up!
- Get out! Get out!
- Fred! Fred, wake up! Wake up!
She's burning up! She's gonna hit.
Look out!
It's all right, Fred. Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep, Fred.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
[FRED WHIMPERING]
All you have to do is...
...go to sleep and rest.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep, Fred.
Go to sleep...
...and rest.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
All you have to do is rest.
Go to sleep.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry I woke you up.
Oh, that's all right but...
I know. You're about to say, "Where am I?"
I'll tell you later, Fred.
You can sleep as long as you want.
[GROANS]
- Did he fly 17s or 24s?
- I don't know.
- What group was he with?
- He didn't say.
Well, what did you two talk about?
Rob, you'd better hurry up.
You'll be late for school.
Holy Moses.
I'll see you later. Bye.
Oh, excuse me, captain.
I'm Rob Stephenson, Peggy's brother.
She's in there in the kitchen.
She's fixing your breakfast.
I've gotta run. Goodbye.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Sit down.
- Here, this may help.
- Thanks.
Hmm. Sit down.
You're Peggy, aren't you?
Heh, for the last time, yes. Want some eggs?
- Hmm. You think I can take them?
- Sure, they'll be good for you.
- Like them scrambled?
- Any way you cook them.
Good.
Sleep all right?
Wonderful.
That's good.
- Can I help you with any of that business?
- You can pour the coffee if you want some.
Do you mind if I ask you
a somewhat personal question?
No.
- Where did you sleep last night?
- On the couch.
- That's terrible.
- What's terrible?
I should've had enough sense
to go to a hotel...
...and not come around here
bothering you.
You didn't bother anybody, Fred.
We're very glad to have you here.
Besides, you couldn't have
gotten a room in a hotel.
Did I get out of line with you?
No. Not really.
- That's good. Because, you see, I'm married.
- Yes, I know.
I must have got pretty plastered
last night.
Heh, you had nothing on my dad.
Your dad? Who's he?
Don't you remember Al?
Oh, Al. Heh. Yeah, good old Al. Where is he?
Still asleep, I guess.
So you're Al's daughter.
Heh. You've got it all straight now.
- I feel a lot better.
- That's good.
- Are you married, Peggy?
- No.
I guess you've hardly had time.
- You must have been engaged, though.
- No.
Why not? What's the matter
with the guys around here?
Heh. I guess the best of them
are already married.
- Good morning, Fred.
- Oh, good morning, Mrs., uh...
- Milly's the name.
- Heh. Thanks, Milly.
When Al wakes up,
tell him how much I appreciate--
You're not going.
You haven't even finished your breakfast.
Heh. I'm afraid I haven't got
much of an appetite this morning.
Besides, I've gotta get downtown.
Maybe now I can get into
that apartment house where my wife lives.
I'll drive you, Fred.
I've got to get to work at the hospital.
Just be a minute.
I must've acted
pretty disgracefully last night.
No.
You just fell in with bad company
at Butch's and got stinking.
You see, the whole trouble was
I couldn't find Marie, that's my wife.
- I didn't know she had a job in a nightclub.
- Could've happened to anyone.
If Al had come home a little later last night,
we wouldn't have been in.
He wouldn't have known
where to look for us.
- How is Al?
- We don't know yet.
Ready, Fred.
When he wakes up, you can tell him for me,
I think he's a pretty lucky guy.
Thank you, Fred.
- Goodbye, Milly, and thanks for everything.
- Goodbye.
PEGGY: Bye, Mom.
MILLY: Bye, dear.
[GROANS]
Hmm?
[GROANS]
[SHOES THUD]
[WATER SPLASHING]
AL [SINGING]:
Among my souvenirs
[AL YELLS]
- What'd you do before the war, Fred?
- I was a fountain attendant.
- A what?
- Soda jerk.
Oh.
- Surprised?
- Yes, a little.
I bet you mixed up
a fine ice cream soda.
[FRED CHUCKLES]
You're darn right.
I was an expert behind that fountain.
I used to toss
a scoop of ice cream in the air...
...adjust for wind drift, velocity, altitude,
and, Wham, in the cone every time.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
I figure that's where
I really learned to drop bombs.
[PEGGY CHUCKLES]
What do you think you'll do now?
I'm not going back to that drugstore.
Somehow or other, I can't figure myself
getting excited about a root beer float.
I don't know just what I will do...
...but I'm gonna take
plenty of time looking around.
I guess after all the places you've been,
Boone City looks pretty dreary to you.
Not from where I'm sitting right now.
That's not just a line. I really meant it.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
AL: Who's that?
MILLY: It's me. Milly.
- I brought your breakfast.
- Oh-ho, thanks.
- Didn't think you'd be up for hours.
- You know, I had a dream.
I dreamt I was home.
I've had that same dream
hundreds of times before.
This time I wanted to find out
if it's really true.
- Am I really home?
- Looks like it.
And you're going to be royally treated.
You're having breakfast in bed.
I seem to have a vague recollection
that we had a couple of children.
- Is that right?
- That's right.
What ever became of them?
Rob's gone to school
and Peggy's driving downtown with Fred.
Fred? Oh.
Oh, yeah, Fred. Ha, ha. He's a great guy.
Oh, yeah.
All right?
There's your breakfast.
I have work to do.
Well, it was nice knowing you, Peggy.
- Heh. That sounds like a permanent goodbye.
- You never know.
You and your wife
must come up to dinner.
That'd be fine.
Oh, there's one thing more.
About that dream I had last night.
I've had it before.
I'm sorry I had to bother you with it.
Oh, I--
But you were very kind and you didn't
even mention it this morning.
As a matter of fact,
you've been swell about everything.
I think they ought to put you
in mass production.
- Heh. Goodbye, Fred.
- Bye.
- Maybe I'd better wait and see if you get in.
- Ha, ha. Maybe that's a good idea.
[CHUCKLES]
[CHUCKLES]
[CHUCKLES]
Bye.
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
All right. All right.
Say, what's the big I--?
- Freddy!
- Hi, babe.
Freddy, darling,
why didn't you let me know?
You didn't give me a chance
to fix my face or anything.
- You look all right, babe.
- Oh, Freddy, darling. I'm so excited.
I can't believe it's you.
Come on in, honey,
where I can look at you.
Oh, you're marvelous. All those ribbons!
You gotta tell me what they all mean.
But not now. Ha, ha.
Let me look at you.
But how did you know I was here?
When I got in yesterday,
I went over to Pop's--
- Yesterday? Why didn't--?
- I came here, but it was too late.
You'd already gone to work.
- I went from one nightclub to another.
- Oh.
- You were looking for me?
- I was looking for my wife.
You've found her now.
AL:
Hmm.
I wonder how Fred's getting along.
Fred looks to me as if
he's able to take care of himself.
I'm not so sure about that.
It isn't easy for those Air Force
glamour boys when they get grounded.
Now, when you've been in the infantry,
any change is bound to be an improvement.
Please stop fussing around
and sit down and talk to me.
All right, sergeant.
Gosh, you've got tough.
- Is this all the cream there is?
- That's all.
Fine situation when a man
can't get enough to eat in his own home.
Look at my pants.
- What about them?
- Too big.
Gives you an idea
of what the war did to my waistline.
- You holding your stomach in?
- No, it's disappeared.
I'll have to take my clothes to
Wyndham and Briggs, get them altered.
I wouldn't be in too much of a hurry
about that.
A couple of weeks of heavy eating
and those pants will fit perfectly.
[PHONE RINGING]
Don't answer it.
Hello. Oh, yes. He's here.
For me?
If it's the War Department, I'm out.
It's Mr. Milton.
- Who?
- Mr. Milton. At the bank.
Oh.
MILLY:
He'll be right on.
Hello?
Oh, yes, Mr. Milton.
Yeah, it sounds good to hear yours.
Yes.
Yes, indeed, Mr. Milton. Yeah.
Well, not too bad, no.
Yes. Why, of course.
It's very kind of you to say that.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yes.
Well, I'll certainly drop in.
Heh. Oh, she's fine, thank you.
- Yes, they're fine too.
-[MOUTHS] They're fine too.
Well-- I-- That's--
Thank you, Mr. Milton.
Yes, good.
Good--
Good-- Goodbye.
Mr. Milton.
He's called up every day this week
to see if you'd got home.
I guess they want you back at the bank.
He wants me to drop in and talk about it.
You're not going to work right away.
You ought to rest a while,
take a vacation.
Oh, I've got to make money.
Last year it was kill Japs,
and this year it's make money.
- We're all right for the time being.
- Hmm.
Why do they bother me like that
the first day I get home?
Why can't they give a fellow time
to get used to his own family?
Why don't you come over here
and sit down?
- Chair's liable to break.
- We can't be worrying about chairs.
Not when they want me back
in a nice fat job at a nice fat bank.
- You don't seem very happy about it.
- I'm not.
- Why not, darling?
- I can't help thinking about the other guys.
All the ones who haven't got you.
- You're crazy.
- No.
Too sane for my own good.
- Yes, sir?
- Didn't this used to be Bullard's Drugstore?
Yes, but it was taken over last year
by the Midway chain.
Oh.
But old Mr. Bullard's still here,
in charge of prescriptions.
- He's right over there by the phone.
- Thanks.
BULLARD:
Yes, sir?
- Oh, Fred Derry.
- Heh, hello, Mr. Bullard.
- Oh, it's good to see you again.
- How are you? It's good to see you.
- Say, what happened here?
- Well, I sold out.
The Midway people had been
after this location for a long time.
- Didn't he used to work here?
- Yes, he did.
I'll bet he's back looking for a job.
And he'll get it too,
with all those ribbons on his chest.
Well, nobody's job is safe
with all these servicemen crowding in.
I'd like to have you meet
our new manager, Mr. Thorpe.
Oh, no, I don't think so.
I just dropped in to say hello to you.
- I don't want that old job back.
- Yes, I know.
But Midway's a big, big outfit.
You never can tell. Come along.
- Thank you, Mr. Bullard.
<i>- I'll</i> see you later.
I can see that you had
a splendid war record, Derry.
Just average, Mr. Thorpe.
You'll understand
that since this business changed hands...
...we're under no obligation
to give you your old job back.
I wasn't thinking of my old job.
I'm looking for a better one.
What are your qualifications?
Your experience?
Two years behind a soda fountain...
...and three years
behind a Norden bombsight.
Yeah.
While in the Army, did you have
any experience in procurement?
- No.
- Purchasing of supplies, materials?
I didn't do any of that.
I just dropped bombs.
- Did you do any personnel work?
- No.
But, as an officer, you surely
had to act in an executive capacity...
...you had to command men,
be responsible for their morale?
No, I was only responsible
for getting the bombs on the target.
I didn't command anybody.
I see.
I'm sure that work required great skill.
But, unfortunately,
we've no opportunities...
-...for that with Midway Drugs.
- Yeah.
However, we might be able to
provide an opening for you...
...as an assistant to Mr. Merkel,
the floor manager.
- Sticky Merkel?
- Clarence Merkel.
Yeah, that's the fella. He used to be
my assistant at the soda fountain.
He's a very good man.
Incidentally, your work would require
part-time duties at the soda fountain.
- At what salary?
- Thirty-two fifty per week.
Thirty-two fifty.
I used to make over $400 a month
in the Air Force.
- The war is over, Derry.
-ls over.
Yeah, well, uh, I think I'll look around,
Mr. Thorpe.
Thank you, very much.
Take care of that cold.
FRED: I gotta run. I'll drop back later.
All right, Fred.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Excuse me, girls.
No, conditions are none too good
right now, Al.
Considerable uncertainty in the business
picture. Strikes, taxes still ruinous.
- You like that cigar?
- Oh, yes, Mr. Milton. It's fine.
Hmm, hard to get those during the war,
but they're coming in regularly from Havana.
All things will readjust themselves
in time.
We want you back here with us, Al.
Well, that's very nice of you,
Mr. Milton, but, uh...
...I noticed, uh, Steese
sitting at my old desk.
- I wouldn't wanna push him out.
- Steese will stay right there.
You're moving up.
What would you say to being
vice president in charge of small loans...
...at a salary of $12,000 a year?
What would you say to that, huh?
- I'd, uh-- I'd say it can't be true.
- Job's there, Al. You're the man for it.
What makes you think I am, Mr. Milton?
Well, your war experience
would prove invaluable to us here.
See, we have many new problems.
This GI Bill of Rights, for instance.
It involves us in consideration
of all kinds of loans to ex-servicemen.
We need a man who understands
the soldiers' problems...
...and at the same time
who's well-grounded...
...in the fundamental principles
of sound banking.
In other words, you.
- Well? What do you say, Al?
- Well...
- I'm overwhelmed.
- Of course. Of course.
Will you bring them in now,
Mrs. Garrett?
GARRETT [OVER INTERCOM]:
Yes, sir.
- I'd, uh, thought of taking it easy for a while.
- Naturally, my boy.
After what you've been through,
you need a vacation.
Thank you. Thank you.
You're entitled to enjoy life for a change
before you come back to work.
- Very kind of you to say that, Mr. Milton.
- Heh.
While you're resting, let's just--
When you get a chance.
This contains reports with all the figures
on our small loans.
It'll give you the whole picture.
You can look them over.
Just in your spare time, of course.
Oh, briefcase is a slight gift
from the bank, heh.
Well, heh, thank you.
- Thank you very much, Mr. Milton.
- Glad to have you back, Al.
Thank you, sir.
Well, of course, sweetheart.
I knew you'd be heartbroken.
But listen, you can get another blond.
What about Sylvia Mack?
[LAUGHING]
Oh, you're crazy.
I think her legs are cute.
Oh, heh, well, I'm sorry too,
but he doesn't want me to work nights.
He says it's inconvenient.
[LAUGHING]
Oh, he's wonderful. And how.
Snappy uniform,
a whole ribbon counter on his chest.
Sure, I'll bring him in sometime.
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
The doorbell's ringing.
I guess that's Freddy.
Yeah, yeah. Bye.
Hey, Marie, have you got an extra key?
I'd like to have it.
- What are you looking at?
- Holy smoke, honey.
That's the first time
I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Oh, well, heh, from now on, honey,
you're not gonna see me in anything else.
I just got it out of the mothballs
over at Pop's house.
I called up the Blue Devil.
- Who?
- Oh, heh, that's the night club where I worked.
- I told them I'm through.
- Oh, swell.
But let's go there for dinner, Freddy, huh?
I'd like to introduce you to the gang.
- They've heard me talk so much about you.
- Anything you say.
Here's some perfume
and some other junk I bought in Paris.
Oh! Fleurette No. 5. And this scarf's cute.
To think of having things from Paris.
Freddy, honey,
you're just a big hunk of heaven.
- What's that a picture of?
- Bomb hits on Dusseldorf.
Oh, that's my B-17.
MARIE:
What are those?
Little black flowers that grow in the sky.
Hey, that's me!
Yeah, I had this picture pasted
on the plexiglass over my bombsight.
- It took a lot of trips over Germany, baby, heh.
- That's sweet.
The guys used to kid me about it.
They'd take a look at the picture and ask,
"Who's the dame?"
And when I told them
it was my wife they'd say:
"Ah, go on, nobody's got a wife
looks like that.
What's her telephone number?"
When we go out tonight,
will you wear your uniform?
- Oh, no.
- For my sake.
- I'm sorry, baby.
- I'd be so proud to be out with you.
Won't you, please?
- Well, seeing as it's you.
- Oh.
Seeing as I can't find any place
to hang it up, all right.
But it's the last time.
From now on,
if you don't like me in civilian clothes...
-...we'll just have to stay here all the time.
- Would that be so bad?
Seriously, honey, you gotta get yourself
some new clothes. That suit's awful.
I know, it's terrible.
But they tell me
you can't buy anything new now.
I know a place where you can get
snappy suits made to order.
You mean there's a black market?
You can get a lot of things,
if you know the right people.
And if you don't care
how much you spend.
We're not worrying about that, baby.
I got money. Cash money.
Nearly a thousand bucks
right from the good old U.S. Treasury.
Oh, now you look wonderful.
You look like yourself.
You know, honey, it's so wonderful,
I can hardly believe it.
Now we can have a real honeymoon
without a care in the world.
Just as if nothing had ever happened.
Just as if you'd never gone away.
- We're right back where we started.
- Don't say that, Marie.
- Don't say what?
- That we're right back where we started.
We can never be back there again.
We never wanna be back there.
But why not? What is it?
What's the matter with you, Fred?
Oh, never mind. Skip it.
I was back to the drugstore
where I used work...
...and I just got suddenly reminded.
[CHUCKLES]
Come on, let's go out and have fun.
MR. PARRISH: Hello, Wilma.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Parrish.
- Have you seen Homer?
- He's out in the woodshed.
[GUNSHOT]
Says he wants to get in some practice
shooting. So he can go hunting.
Thought that he'd seen enough shooting
in the war.
Well, I guess he just wants
to find something to occupy himself.
I guess so.
I wish there was something
I knew to do for him.
His mother and I have tried
to make him feel at home.
But he just keeps to himself
all the time.
[GUNSHOT]
[GUNSHOT]
WILMA:
Hello, Luella. What are you kids doing?
Oh, nothing, we're just playing.
That's his girl. They're engaged.
[KIDS CHUCKLE]
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
- Oh, hello, Wilma.
- Hello.
- Looking for something?
- No.
Go right ahead.
- How'd you do, Homer?
- Only fair.
Well, you did fine.
I'll do better.
I've been wanting to have
a chance to talk to you.
- What about?
- About everything.
About us.
What about us?
- We're all right, aren't we?
- No.
- Listen to me, Homer.
- I'm listening.
You wrote me that when you got home
you and I were going to be married.
If you wrote that once, you wrote it
a hundred times. Isn't that true?
Yes, but things are different now.
Have you changed your mind?
Have I said anything about
changing my mind?
No. That's just it.
You haven't said anything
about anything.
- That's not loaded, is it?
- Of course, it isn't loaded.
Don't you think I know
how to handle a gun?
I don't know what to think, Homer.
All I know is, I was in love with you
when you left...
...and I'm in love with you now.
Other things may have changed,
but that hasn't.
You wanna see how the hooks work?
You wanna see the freak?
All right, I'll show you.
Take a good look.
[WHIMPERING]
I didn't mean anything, Homer.
I was only...
[LUELLA SOBBING]
I'm sorry, Luella.
It isn't your fault.
Go on and play with your friends.
I know, Wilma. I was wrong.
I shouldn't have acted like that.
It wasn't her that burned my hands off.
I'll be all right.
I just gotta work it out myself.
- I could help you, Homer, if you'd let me.
- I've gotta work it out myself.
All I've wanted is for people to treat me
like anybody else instead of pitying me.
I guess it's hard for them to do that.
I've just gotta learn to get used to it
and pay no attention.
- Couldn't I--?
- No, I've gotta do it myself.
MR. PARRISH: Yes?
- Okay, Pop, I'm going to bed now.
MR. PARRISH:
Be right with you, Homer.
Good night, son.
Good night, Pop. Thanks.
[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO]
[DOOR OPENS]
FRED:
Hello, babe.
- What you got there?
- Our supper.
Cream of corn soup, potato salad, salami
and liverwurst.
We're going to Jackie's Hot Spot.
I phoned and made a reservation.
We're eating at home.
What's the matter, honey?
You sick or something?
No, dear. Broke.
- Broke?
- You got it.
But what happened? Where did it go to?
We spent it, babe.
That's what happened.
I'm sorry it's so sudden.
I didn't tell you the money
was almost gone...
...because every day I kept hoping
I was gonna land a good job.
At last I got it through my thick skull
that I'm not going to get one...
...so we'll have to forget about
Jackie's Hot Spot...
...and the Blue Devil and all the rest.
Why couldn't you get a job?
- You really been trying?
- Sure.
I've been all over town.
All the employment offices and the USES.
They all tell me I don't know anything.
They say I ought to spend a couple of years
as an apprentice or go to a trade school.
A couple of years
with you going to kindergarten.
And what would I be doing
in the meantime?
Well, you could always help me
with my homework.
- Fred.
- Yep?
Are you really all right?
Of course, I'm all right. Why?
- I mean, in your mind. ls there anything--?
- My mind?
Heh, you mean you think I'm going goofy?
- I've been wondering.
- Heh.
What was Gadosky?
Where did you hear about him?
You talk in your sleep, honey.
Sometimes you shout.
Something's on fire...
...and you want somebody to get out.
You keep saying, "Gadosky, Gadosky."
Gadorsky.
Oh, he was a friend of mine, a B-17 pilot.
He got it over Berlin.
Can't you get those things
out of your system?
- Oh, sure.
- Maybe that's what's holding you back.
The war's over. You won't get any place
till you stop thinking about it.
Come on, snap out of it.
Okay, honey, I'll do that.
I didn't tell you, Fred,
but I got a little money saved.
Dinner's on me tonight.
You'd better keep on saving it, babe.
It might come in handy sometime.
I appreciate the offer,
but we're eating at home.
Well, I'm hungry.
I'm going out by myself.
You're not going out. You're gonna stay here
and eat what I cook and like it.
Let go of me.
When we were married, the justice
of the peace said something about...
...for richer, for poorer,
for better, for worse. Remember?
- This is the worse.
- When do we get going on the better?
Whenever I get wise to myself, I guess.
Whenever I wake up and realize
I'm not an officer and a gentleman anymore.
I'm just another soda jerk out of a job.
Now, go on and sit down
and read a magazine...
...or listen to the radio
while I cook the soup.
I'll fix you a nice meal, honey.
Just like I used to do behind the fountain,
before the war.
The Perfume and Cosmetics Department
is now our outstanding feature.
It accounts for 34 percent
of our gross intake...
...and a higher proportion of our profits.
As you will surmise, our customers in this
department are almost exclusively women.
Yes, I'd surmised that.
Familiarize yourself
with the pronunciation of the perfumes.
For instance, here's a popular number.
- Réve Romantique.
- Yeah, that means romantic dream.
- You speak French?
- Well, I'll tell you, Sticky...
...just enough to make
my way around the Paris bars.
Let's get one thing straight, Derry.
The name Sticky is out.
- Yes, Mr. Merkel. I understand.
- This week, we're pushing...
...the new champagne
bubble bath preparation.
A dollar ninety-eight for the large jar. Down
here are some special made-- Come here.
Down here are some
specially made-up toilet sets.
They don't represent a very great...
- Good morning, Mr. Brook.
- Good morning.
WOMAN: Thank you.
- Good morning.
MAN:
I have an appointment with you.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Good morning, Mrs. Garrett.
What have we here?
The Bretton Woods agreement?
That's a Mr. Novak waiting over there.
I've filled out the basic form.
He's applying for a GI loan.
- Oh, good. I'll see him.
- Mr. Novak.
- Sit down, Mr. Novak.
- Thank you, sir.
[AL CHUCKLES]
Don't sir me, Mr. Novak.
I'm a sergeant.
- I see you were in the Navy.
- Yes, sir.
I mean, yes, I was in the Seabees.
Where'd you operate?
All over the Pacific.
One little after island after another.
What'd you do, mostly?
We went in before the landings...
...and cleared the mines
and underwater obstructions.
When they'd taken enough ground
for an airstrip, we'd build it.
Fairly interesting work, eh?
No, it got monotonous.
Those islands all look alike.
Heh, until Iwo Jima. That was different.
So I've heard.
I see you have quite a family.
A wife and four children.
Yes, there'd have been more
if I hadn't been away three years.
[AL CHUCKLES]
- And now you wanna buy a farm.
- Yes, sir.
Got my eye on a fine piece of property.
Forty acres, out near Anton Corners.
What about collateral?
Collateral? What's that?
Security for your loan.
What can you put up
in the way of property?
Have you any stocks and bonds,
real estate, valuables of any kind?
Well, no, Mr. Stephenson, you see,
the point is, I haven't got any property.
That's why I want the loan,
so I can get the property.
I see.
No collateral.
That makes things difficult.
I'm a good farmer, Mr. Stephenson.
Why, even during the war
I kept my hand in.
I used to spend my spare time
down on those little islands...
...working truck gardens
so my outfit could have fresh tomatoes...
...and green corn and all that.
And before the war, I was a sharecropper,
like my father before me.
And now, I feel I'd like to have
a little piece of my own to work.
- You like to grow things, eh?
- Yes, sir.
With the food shortage
all over the world...
...it's seems to me that farming's about
the most important work there is.
I mean...
Well, don't you think so,
Mr. Stephenson?
Yes.
You see, Mr. Stephenson...
...I don't feel this is asking
the bank for a handout.
I feel it's my right.
At least, that's what I've been told
by other ex-servicemen...
...that the government guarantees
loans to us, if we wanna buy--
Your loan would be administered
through this bank...
...which would put up half of the $6000
you require.
Now, that involves risk for this bank,
Mr. Novak.
Excuse me.
- Al.
- Homer.
- Look at you.
- Look at you.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
- So this is where you work.
- Sort of.
What are you doing here?
Sticking up the bank?
Look at it, Al, 200 leaves of cabbage.
That's what I get every month
from Old Mr. Whiskers from now on.
- Pretty soft, eh?
- Pretty soft.
- You sure we haven't shortchanged you?
- Oh, no.
I kept my eye on that guy
when he counted it out.
[AL CHUCKLES]
Say, Al, did you know Fred Derry
had a job at the Midway drugstore?
No, I didn't.
- He introduced me to his wife.
- Yeah?
[WHISTLES]
- Some dish.
- Yeah?
We'll all have to get together at Butch's.
Fine. Oh, that's where I'm going now.
- Yeah?
- Take a piano lesson.
Uh-huh. Take one for me
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
- See you later. Bye.
- So long, Homer.
Well, uh, as I was saying, Mr. Novak...
...there is an element of risk involved.
Uh, we'll have to have the property appraised,
but, uh, you'll get your loan.
Say, Mr. Stephenson...
-...I don't know how to begin to thank you.
- Don't try.
You look like a good risk to me.
And when those tomato plants
start producing, I'll come for free samples.
I'll let you know
when the papers are ready.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
God bless you.
Oh, I've seen advertisements
about this one.
Night of Bliss. Is it all that they say it is?
Well, just what do they say it is?
Haunting, provocative, languorous.
Oh, yes, I'm sure it's all of those, heh.
[TOY CAR WHIRRING]
WOMAN:
Dexter.
- Don't play with those toys, bud.
- My name ain't Bud.
- Dexter, you stop that. Do you hear?
- I just wanted to see how it worked.
- Sorry. You heard what Mommy said.
-It's all right.
Oh, Seduction. How much is that?
This is, uh...
It's quite expensive.
It's 16.50, but it's a nice size.
You see what I mean?
But it's a good, safe bet.
Uh, just what do you mean by that?
Well, I mean it's, uh...
- Well, it's a perfume that fits any mood.
- Oh, heh.
All right, I'll take it.
Very good, madam.
DEXTER:
Mommy, Mommy, look! Barn, barn, barn!
I shot it down! I shot down a plane!
[CUSTOMERS MURMURING]
I'm very sor--
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.
Thank you very much.
I'll be with you in just a moment, madam.
Will you take this, please?
[FRED CHUCKLES]
This lady will have your package
and your change in a moment.
Thank you very much and come in again.
WOMAN:
Thank you.
- You were wonderful.
- I wanted to smack him.
It's against the rules here
to chat with customers unless it's a sale.
Oh, all right, I'll buy something.
What's this?
Youth Recaptured,
that's a complexion cream.
But you don't need
any of that phony stuff.
[PEGGY CHUCKLES]
Well, that's vanishing cream.
This is a vanishing cream remover.
I'll tell you how you can save money.
If you don't put that on,
then you don't need this to take that off.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
How about some lotion?
Here's one at $2.98,
and you'd be overcharged at half the price.
I didn't really come in to buy anything.
Dad told me you were working here
and I just dropped in to say hello.
Oh, just a minute.
I have....
I have an hour off at 1:00.
Are you doing anything for lunch?
Why, no.
Thank you, madam.
I'll meet you outside in 20 minutes.
- Come in again.
- Thank you.
[GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
The apple pie, she's homemade.
- Heh, good.
- Thank you.
It is a nice little place.
I never heard of it before.
I used to come here now and then
in the old days, before the war.
Sometimes I used to think of this place
when I was overseas.
I thought, "When I get back home
I'm never gonna eat in a dump like Lucia's."
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
What else did you think you wouldn't do
when you were overseas?
I never had any clear ideas,
but there were two things I was sure of.
One, that I knew
I'd never go back to that drugstore.
- What was the other thing?
- Mm, that was even sillier.
[CHUCKLES]
I dreamed I was gonna have
my own home.
Just a nice little house for my wife
and me out in the country...
...in the suburbs, anyway.
That's the cockeyed kind of dream
you have when you're overseas.
You don't have to be overseas
to have dreams like that.
Yeah.
You can get crazy ideas
right here at home.
Didn't you say
you had to be back at work at 2?
Yeah.
Well, hadn't you better...?
Yeah. Uh, check, please.
Eighty-five cents apiece for lunch,
plus tax, that's a $1.76.
FRED:
Okay.
Thank you very much.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Goodbye, signorina. Come again.
FRED:
We'll do that. So long, Giuseppe.
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Fred.
Well...
That shouldn't have happened.
But I guess it had to.
- Goodbye, Peggy.
- Goodbye.
MILTON: We were discussing
this loan to this man, uh...
What's his name?
Novak.
Yes, yes, I approved it.
Well, may I ask, Al, on what basis?
On the basis of my own judgment.
- Novak looked to me like a good bet.
- But the man has no collateral, no security.
- Evidently, you saw something in this man.
- Yes, Mr. Milton.
- What was it?
- Security.
Collateral.
Mr. Milton, in the Army
I've had to be with men...
...when they were stripped
of everything...
...in the way of property except what they
carried around with them and inside them.
I saw them being tested. Some of them
stood up to it and some didn't.
But you got so you could tell
which ones you could count on.
I tell you, this man Novak is okay.
His collateral is in his hands,
in his heart, in his guts.
- In his right as a citizen.
- Nobody's denying him his rights.
Oh, yes, we are. If we deny him
his chance to work in his own way.
Gentlemen,
there's no need to raise our voices.
Of course, since you've approved the loan,
the incident is closed.
- However, in the future, Al--
- Yes, I understand, Mr. Milton.
In the future,
I must exercise more caution.
Thank you, Mr. Prew.
AI, uh...
[DOOR CLOSES]
Al, you know how I feel about you
and always have.
Why, I've always considered you
one of the family, so to speak.
Like my own s-- Younger brother.
I picked you personally for this job,
and I know you'll make good.
And we do. We have every desire...
...to extend a helping hand
to returning veterans...
...whenever possible.
But we must all remember
that this is not our money we're doling out.
It belongs to our depositors...
...and we can't gamble with it.
I'll remember, Mr. Milton.
[MILTON CHUCKLES]
We'll meet at the Union Club at 7:30.
- And, uh, give my best to your charming wife.
- Thank you, Mr. Milton.
[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]
[DOOR OPENS]
FRED:
Hello.
Oh, hello.
Say, better hurry and get dressed.
And wear your new suit.
We're going out to dinner
at the Embassy Club.
Oh, don't worry, it won't cost a nickel.
We got invited.
- Who invited us?
- Ms. Peggy Stephenson.
She called up a little while ago and
said her father was a friend of yours.
She sounded like a nice kid. She's going
with some boyfriend of hers...
...and asked us to come on a double date,
as guests.
- You told her we could go?
- You bet I did.
Well, call her up and tell her we can't go.
Tell her I made another engagement.
Tell her anything.
Say, who is this Peggy Stephenson?
- She's a girl.
- I didn't think she was a kangaroo.
Where did you meet her?
I told you, the night I got back
and you weren't here.
Al Stephenson
and his wife took me home.
She's their daughter.
I'd never seen her before.
Or since?
If you think you're gonna make anything
out of this, you're due for a disappointment.
I just don't like accepting handouts
when we're broke.
Well, you'd better get used to it.
Because I don't see how we're gonna get
much fun on your 32.50 a week.
- Hold still.
- Mm.
You'll probably have to make a speech.
It's my plan to meet that situation
by getting well plastered.
Peggy's going out dancing
with Woody Merrill.
- Who's he?
- You know, Bill Merrill's son.
Oh, yeah. Fine people, the Merrills.
Strictly TCR.
- What's that?
- Top credit rating.
- Are his intentions honorable?
- I doubt it.
But they're going to be properly
chaperoned by Fred Derry and his wife.
Fred Derry? Ha. Some chaperone.
- I think she's crazy about him.
- Who, Merrill?
No, Fred.
Have you got any evidence
to support that amazing statement?
- Just a hunch.
- Oh.
But my hunches are pretty good.
- Ah, cocktails.
- Oh, no, you don't.
I made this for Woody Merrill,
he's coming to pick me up.
Surely you wouldn't deny your poor old
father a drop on a cold night like this.
I would if I could.
- I hear you're gonna see Fred, hmm?
- Yes.
What's his wife like?
I don't know. I'll tell you later.
They'll have cocktails at the Union Club.
I know the kind Mrs. Milton serves.
Pink, sweet and nauseating.
I was just asking Peggy
about Fred's wife.
Never mind, Mom.
I know what you're both thinking.
What are we thinking?
You're afraid I may be in love with Fred.
- Why, I never had any such id--
- Shut up, Al.
Are you in love with him?
Yes.
But I don't want to be.
That's why I asked him
and his wife to go out with us this evening.
I think it ought to have
a very healthy effect on me.
Once I get to know her, I...
Well, I'm sure I'll stop being silly
about the whole thing.
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
Oh.
We don't need to worry about that child.
She can take care of herself.
That's what she thinks.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- You know my father.
- Mr. Stephenson.
Nice to see you again.
- Have a drink?
- Thank you.
I've, uh, played a lot of golf with your father.
Yes, I know.
Been to the club since you got back?
- Haven't had a chance.
- Come on, we'll be late.
- Right.
MILLY: Good night.
WOODY: Night.
- Well, have a good time, children.
Thank you.
Give, uh, my best to Fred.
Al, come on.
Yes, Mr. Milton.
- Hello, Peggy.
- Oh, Woody, don't be a bore.
Come on, we'll be late.
Our country must stand today
where it has always stood...
...the citadel of individual initiative...
...the land of unlimited opportunity
for all.
It is peculiarly appropriate
that we meet here tonight...
...to honor one
who has valiantly fought for that freedom.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we greet our friend...
...our coworker, our hero,
Al Stephenson.
[ALL APPLAUDING]
Come on, on your feet, Al. On your feet.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm very happy to be here.
In fact, I'm very happy to be anywhere.
In fact, I'm very happy-
[ALL CHUCKLE]
Uh, perhaps it'd be a good idea
if you just put that bottle...
...right down here in front of me, hmm?
- Here, save yourself quite a number of trips.
- Heh, good old Al.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
And I'm glad to see
you've all pulled through so well.
As Mr. Milton so perfectly expressed it,
our country stands today...
...where it stands today.
Wherever that is.
And I'm sure you'd all agree with me...
...if I said that now's the time for all of us
to stop all this nonsense...
...face facts, get down to brass tacks,
forget about the war, and go fishing.
But I'm not gonna say it.
I'm just going to sum the whole thing up
in one word.
[MILLY CLEARS THROAT]
My wife doesn't think
I'd better sum it up in that one word.
[MILLY CHUCKLES]
I wanna tell you that the reason
for my success as a sergeant...
...is due primarily to my previous training
in the Corn Belt Loan and Trust Company.
The knowledge I acquired
in the good old bank...
...I applied to my problems
in the infantry.
For instance, in Okinawa,
a major comes to me...
...he says, "Stephenson, you see that hill?"
"Yes, sir. I see it."
"All right," he Said.
"You and your platoon
will attack said hill and take it."
So I said to the major, "But, uh, that
operation involves considerable risk.
We haven't sufficient collateral."
"I'm aware of that," said the major,
"but the fact remains, that there is the hill...
...and you are the guys
who are going to take it."
So I said to him,
"I'm sorry, major. No collateral, no hill."
So we didn't take the hill,
and we lost the war.
Uh, I think that, uh, little story
has considerable significance.
But I've, uh, forgotten what it is.
Uh, and now, in conclusion, I'd like to tell you
a humorous anecdote.
I know several humorous anecdotes...
...but I can't think of any way
to clean them up.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
So I'll only say this much.
I love the Corn Belt Loan
and Trust Company.
There are some who say that the old bank
is suffering from hardening of the arteries...
...and of the heart.
I refuse to listen to such radical talk.
I say that our bank is alive,
it's generous, it's...
It's human!
And we're going to have
such a line of customers...
...seeking and getting small loans...
...that people will think we're gambling
with the depositors' money.
And we will be.
We'll be gambling on the future
of this country.
I thank you.
[ALL APPLAUDING]
[BAND PLAYING JAZZ MUSIC]
Oh, Woody, I can't take it anymore.
Let's sit down.
We can't get out. I'm trapped.
- How do you do? Ow.
- Ha, ha.
Beg your pardon.
Well, anyway, we can't fall down.
[ALL CHATTERING]
- Is that table satisfactory?
MAN: Everything. Everything's lovely.
Thank you very much.
Would you care to order now?
Sorry.
- Oh, I can't understand it.
- What?
Why you're not mad about me.
I think I'm attractive.
[CHUCKLES]
- You are, Woody. You're irresistible.
- Then why do you go on resisting me?
You know, all marriages
don't have to be like that one.
- Which one?
- Your friends, Fred and Marie.
What's wrong with their marriage?
Oh, there's nothing wrong,
except for one slight detail.
Heh, they just don't like each other.
Oh, it's murder on the dance floor.
Oh, it's awful.
You mean
you don't wanna dance anymore?
Oh, I'd love to. You don't you mind
if I borrow him for a while?
No, not at all.
Why did you do this, Peggy?
- Do what? What do you mean?
- Calling up Marie and going out like this.
Together.
- I did it deliberately.
- Why?
To prove to myself that what happened
this afternoon didn't really happen.
But it did happen.
It had to happen.
And if we go on seeing each other, Peggy,
it'll happen again.
[WOMAN SINGING]
Excuse us.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Oh, we wanna have a picture
taken over there in a few minutes, huh?
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Fine, I'll be there.
Excuse me.
<i>SINGER:
Got</i> a <i>letter from my baby</i>
Hello, Marie.
Good evening.
You gotta watch yourself in this town.
More wolves.
- I know.
- I pay no attention to the sign.
Go right in, ha, ha.
Gee, Woody's a cute boy. He's a lot of fun.
He's got a lot of dough too.
His family owns half the city, practically.
Certainly has a terrific yen
for you, Peggy.
I don't wanna butt
into your personal affairs...
...but if you'll take my advice, dear,
you'll grab Woody, but quick.
Woody and I are good friends,
but there's no romance there.
Never mind the romantic part.
That takes care of itself.
And I'm speaking from experience.
They'll tell you money isn't everything.
Well, maybe it isn't, but, boy, how it helps.
Do you know that while Fred was away,
I was drawing over $500 a month?
I mean, from his Army pay
and the job I had.
Now the two of us gotta live on
what Fred gets...
...from being a drugstore cowboy.
Thirty-two fifty a week.
Poor Fred. I guess you think
he's an awful sourpuss.
He didn't used to be that way, though.
Army's had an awful effect on him.
Knocked all the life out of him.
Fred isn't going to be satisfied
with that job at the drugstore.
- He'll get something better.
- Oh, sure.
Maybe in five years he'll be drawing down
40 or 50 bucks.
You can't have happy marriages
on that kind of dough.
You know, Peggy, you're cute.
But if you don't mind a personal
suggestion, you could use more makeup.
And I think you could get yourself
a better hairdo.
I'll give you the name of my hairdresser.
Oh, but you've got nothing to worry about.
You'll get Woody
and live happily ever after. It's in the bag.
MAID:
Thank you.
Now, everybody get in close together,
we're all palsy-walsy...
...put our arms around each other.
Come on, Fred. I don't mind.
Ooh, wait a minute, I'll tell you when.
Everybody, happy. Let's all be talking.
What a marvelous party.
We'll have to do this again, right away.
Okay, shoot the picture!
We want four copies, honey.
Mr. Milton certainly acted enthusiastic
about your speech.
Yeah, sure, that's how he acted,
the old hypocrite.
Suppose he'll fire you in the morning?
No, he'll never do anything as impetuous
as that.
He'll back me up wholeheartedly...
...till the next time I give a loan
to some little guy.
Then I'll have to fight it out
all over again.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
MILLY: Yes?
PEGGY: It's me, Peggy.
Oh, come in, darling.
[AL SIGHS]
- Did you have a good time?
PEGGY: Not very.
AL:
Ah. What's all this? Children's hour?
[AL BURPS]
I beg your pardon.
Well, what's she like?
I'm glad I went out with them.
Even though
it was a pretty disagreeable experience.
It took guts, honey,
which you got plenty.
I'll need them.
- I've made up my mind.
- Good girl.
To do what?
I'm going to break that marriage up.
I can't stand it seeing Fred tied to a woman
he doesn't love.
And who doesn't love him.
Oh, it's horrible for him.
It's humiliating and it's killing his spirit.
Somebody's got to help him.
- Are you sure he doesn't love her?
- Of course I am.
Did he tell you?
[SIGHS]
- Did she?
- No.
AL:
So you just jumped to conclusions.
He doesn't love her, he hates her.
I know it. I know it.
Who are you? God?
How did you get this power to interfere
in other people's lives?
Is Fred in love with you?
Yes.
- You've been seeing him?
- Only once. Today.
Oh, it was all perfectly respectable.
But when we were saying goodbye...
...he took me in his arms
and kissed me...
...and I knew.
And you think a kiss
from a smooth operator like Fred...
...you think that means anything?
You don't know him.
You don't know anything about
what's inside him.
Neither does she. His wife.
That's probably what she thought
when she married him.
A smooth operator
with money in his pockets.
But now he isn't smooth any longer,
and she's lost interest in him.
Whereas you're possessed
of all the wisdom of the ages.
You can see into the secret recesses
of his innermost soul.
I can see because I love him.
So you're gonna break this marriage up.
Have you decided yet how you're gonna
do it? You gonna do it with an ax?
It's none of your business
how I'm going to do it.
You've forgotten what it's like
to be in love.
You hear that, Milly?
I'm so old and decrepit, I've forgotten
how it feels to want somebody desperately.
Peggy didn't mean that.
Did you, darling?
No.
I don't know what I do mean.
It's just that everything
has always been so perfect for you.
You loved each other
and you got married in a big church...
...and you had a honeymoon
in the south of France.
And you never had any trouble
of any kind.
So how can you possibly understand
how it is with Fred and me?
We never had any trouble.
How many times have I told you
I hated you and believed it in my heart?
How many times have you said
you were sick and tired of me...
...that we were all washed up?
How many times
have we had to fall in love all over again?
[CRYING]
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Oh, never mind about that, darling.
[CHATTERING]
AL: Fred.
FRED: Hi, Butch.
BUTCH: Hello, Fred.
FRED: Al here?
BUTCH: Yeah, he's back there waiting for you.
FRED: See you later.
- Hi, Al.
AL: Sit down, Fred.
- What are you drinking?
- A cup of coffee.
Gotta have a clear head for soda jerking.
- A cup of coffee and a bourbon and soda.
- Yes, sir.
Well, what's on your mind, Al?
Wanna borrow some money or something?
I, uh...
...called you to ask you a question.
Okay. Shoot.
Are you in love with Peggy?
Is there any law compelling me
to answer that one?
No.
Nevertheless, I repeat.
Are you in love with Peggy?
Yes.
- I thank you for a short and honest answer.
- You're welcome.
- Now, what do we take up next?
- Your wife.
What about her?
Where does she fit
in this romantic situation?
Is that any of your business?
That's what Peggy said,
that it's none of my business.
Oh, you've had her on the carpet too.
She volunteered some information
to her mother and me.
You see, we have
a rather unusual relationship in our family.
It may seem kind of corny and mid-Victorian,
but we tell each other things.
I happen to be quite fond of Peggy,
and I, uh--
You don't want her to get mixed up
with a heel like me.
I haven't called you a heel. Yet.
I just don't wanna see her
get into this mess.
Okay, chum, what do we do now?
Step out and settle this thing
in the alley?
I wouldn't wanna recommend that
as a solution.
I've learned a lot of tricks
in fighting dirty.
If I got tangled up with you,
I might forget myself and break your neck.
I wouldn't like that.
You see, Fred, I'm quite fond of you too.
Thanks.
But I don't like the idea of you
sneaking around corners to see Peggy...
...taking her love on a bootleg basis.
Fair warning.
I'm gonna do everything I can...
...to keep her away from you,
to help her forget about you...
...and get her married to some decent guy
who can make her happy.
Then I guess that's it, Al.
I don't see her anymore.
I'll put that in the form of a guarantee.
I won't see her anymore.
I'll call her up and tell her so.
- That satisfy you?
- Yeah.
- Anything else on your mind?
- No.
Okay, chum, so long.
So long, Fred.
The drinks are on me.
STEVE: Hello, Homer.
- Hi, Steve.
Say, uh, Al Stephenson's back there.
- Al?
- Yeah.
- Hi, Al.
AL: Hello, Homer.
- How are you? How's the family?
- Fine, thanks.
- Hello, Homer.
- Hi, Butch.
- Say, let's show Al that new routine.
- Why, sure.
Got something to show you, Al.
Well, come on.
- Boy, wait till you hear this.
- Are you all set, kid?
- I'm ready when you are.
- Okay.
One, two, three.
[PLAYING "CHOPSTICKS"]
MAN:
That's fine.
[ALL APPLAUD]
What's the matter? Didn't you like it?
We've been working for weeks.
Sure, Homer, it was swell. I thought you
were kidding about those piano lessons.
Fred! Hey, Fred!
That was Fred.
Yeah.
- What's the matter? ls anything wrong?
- Oh, no. He had to go back to the drugstore.
Come on, Homer, buy me a drink.
Who was it?
Fred.
He said he's sorry for what happened,
but it was just one of those things.
He said it wouldn't be fair to his wife
for us to see each other anymore because...
...I'm obviously the kind of girl
that takes these things too seriously.
Then he said goodbye, very politely,
and hung up.
Well, I guess you and Dad
won't have to worry about me anymore.
That's the end of my career
as a home wrecker.
Mom, I know you feel sorry for me.
You think my poor little heart is broken.
But you can save your sympathy.
I can see things clearer now.
I made a fool of myself.
I'm getting some sense
hammered into me now.
I'm glad I'm out of that mess.
I'm glad I'll never see him again!
Two chocolate sundaes coming up.
What about a ham and cheese
on whole wheat without any mustard?
Ham and cheese, dark,
save the mustard, coming up.
Here you are.
[BOY WHISTLES]
GIRL:
Thank you.
FRED: Hello, Homer.
- Hi, Fred.
How've you been? Glad to see you.
- Say, Fred.
- Yeah?
What happened at Butch's?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, uh, you and Al. Was there any trouble?
Oh, no, we were just having
a little friendly chat.
- There you are, sir.
- Thanks.
- What'll it be, Homer?
- Oh, I don't care.
- Give me a chocolate sundae.
- Okay.
Hi.
- How are you, soldier?
- Sailor.
Huh, excuse me.
Say, uh...
...do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?
I know what it is. How did I get
these hooks, and how do they work?
That's what everybody says
when they start off:
"Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?"
Well, I'll tell you.
I got sick and tired
of that old pair of hands I had.
You know, an awful lot of trouble
washing them and manicuring my nails.
So I traded them in
for a pair of these latest models.
They work by radar. Look.
- Pretty cute, eh?
- You got plenty of guts.
It's terrible when you see a guy like you
that had to sacrifice himself.
And for what?
And for what? I don't get you, mister.
- Well--
FRED: Anything else for you?
Check.
We let ourselves get sold down the river.
- We were pushed into war.
- Sure, by the Japs and the Nazis.
- So we had--
- The Germans and the Japs...
...had nothing against us. They wanted
to fight the Limeys and the Reds.
And they would've whipped them too...
...if we didn't get deceived into it
by a bunch of radicals in Washington.
What are you talking about?
We fought the wrong people, that's all.
Just read the facts, my friend.
Find out for yourself
why you had to lose your hands.
And then go do something about it.
FRED: You'd better pay your check, brother,
and go home.
- Well, who do you think you are?
- Pay the cashier right over there.
WOMAN: Coffee, please.
FRED: Yes, ma'am.
There's another thing.
Every soda jerk in this country
has got an idea he's somebody.
Look here, mister,
what are you selling anyway?
I'm not selling anything
but plain old-fashioned Americanism.
Some Americanism.
So we're all a bunch of suckers, eh?
So we should've been on the side
of the Japs and the Nazis, eh?
Again, I say, just look at the facts.
I've seen a couple of facts.
I've seen a ship go down
and over 400 of my shipmates went with it.
Were those guys suckers?
That's the unpleasant truth.
And the sooner we get wise to it,
the better off we're gonna--
- Ooh, if I only had my hands!
- You put those down!
FRED:
Take your hands off of him!
[CUSTOMERS CHATTERING]
MERKEL:
May I get through, please?
- Go get the druggist.
MAN 1: Yes, sir.
- Make way, please. What happened?
MERKEL: It was Fred Derry. He hit him.
Bring some spirits of ammonia,
iodine and bandages.
MAN 2:
Yes, sir.
FRED:
Don't say it, chum.
The customer's always right, so I'm fired.
But this customer wasn't right.
I'll meet you outside in a minute, kid.
Gee, Fred, I'm sorry I lost you your job.
- But that guy--
- Yeah, I know.
You read about guys like that,
but you don't often see them, luckily.
How about your girlfriend, uh, Wilma?
You and she gonna get married?
- I don't know.
- Why don't you know?
- Doesn't she want to get married?
- Oh, it isn't Wilma's fault.
She's been swell about it.
- So then it's your fault?
- Yeah, I...
I guess it is.
- Will you do me a favor, Homer?
- Sure, Fred, what is it?
I'm a hot one to be giving advice
to the lovelorn, but go see Wilma now.
Take her in your arms, kiss her,
ask her to marry you, then marry her.
Tomorrow,
if you can get a license that fast.
If you want anybody to stand up for you
at your wedding...
- There's my bus. So long, kid.
- So long, Fred.
- You all right, Homer?
- Yes, Pop, I'm going to get a glass of milk.
Well, just knock on the door
when you want me.
HOMER:
Okay.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
HOMER: Wilma. What are you doing
out this hour of night?
WILMA: I saw you were up, Homer.
I saw you through the window.
- I've got to talk to you.
- All right, come in.
- Want some chicken?
- No, thanks.
- Sure?
-Yes.
- Want a glass of milk?
- No, thanks, Homer.
Sit down, Wilma.
Homer, my family want me to go away.
Tomorrow.
- Where?
- Up to Silver Lake, at my Aunt Vera's place.
That ought to be nice.
But I don't want to go.
I want to stay here.
You see, the reason they want me to go
is so that I'll forget about you.
They figure you don't want me around,
you don't wanna see me...
...and if I go away for a while,
maybe I'll get all this out of my mind.
Maybe that's a good idea, Wilma.
Maybe you ought to do that.
Do you wanna get rid of me?
Tell me the truth, Homer.
Do you want me to forget about you?
I want you to be free, Wilma.
To live your own life.
I don't want you tied down forever
just because you've got a kind heart.
Oh, Homer, why can't you ever understand
the way things really are...
...the way I really feel?
I keep trying to tell you.
But you don't know, Wilma.
You don't know what it'd be like
to have to live with me...
...to have to face this every day,
every night.
But I can only find out by trying.
And if it turns out I haven't
courage enough, we'll soon know it.
Wilma, you and I have been close
to each other for a long time, haven't we?
Ever since we were kids.
Yes, Homer.
I'm going upstairs to bed.
I want you to-- I want you to come up
and see for yourself what happens.
All right, Homer.
I've learned how to take this harness off.
I can wiggle into my pajama top.
I'm lucky, I have my elbows.
Some of the boys don't.
But I can't button them up.
I'll do that, Homer.
This is when I know I'm helpless.
My hands are down there on the bed.
I can't put them on again
without calling to somebody for help.
I can't smoke a cigarette or read a book.
If that door should blow shut,
I can't open it and get out of this room.
I'm as dependent as a baby that doesn't
know how to get anything except cry for it.
Well, now you know, Wilma.
Now you have an idea of what it is.
I guess you don't know what to say.
It's all right.
Go on home.
Go away, like your family said.
I know what to say, Homer.
I love you.
And I'm never going to leave you. Never.
You mean you didn't mind?
Of course not. I told you I loved you.
I love you, Wilma.
I always have, and I always will.
Good night, darling. Sleep well.
Good night, Wilma.
Hey, Sugar. You'd better step on it,
or your husband will be home.
Oh, don't worry. He's job hunting.
He won't come home for another hour.
- And what if he does?
- I don't understand it.
Guy like that with all this money around
and he can't get into it.
- What's the matter with him?
- Oh, I guess he just isn't very bright.
How do you do?
FRED:
Fine, thanks. Who are you?
Oh, Fred, I want you to meet Cliff Scully,
an old friend of mine.
- Hi, Freddy.
- Glad to know you, Scully. Get out.
A tough guy, huh?
Now, listen, Fred. You're not gonna get
anywhere with that attitude.
Cliff Scully's an old friend of mine.
He's asked me out, and I'm going out.
If you don't like it,
you know what you can do.
You heard me, chum. Get out.
- What do I do next? Smack him.
- Why ask her? Can't you think for yourself?
Go on Cliff. I can handle this.
Wait for me downstairs.
CLIFF:
Okay.
Another ex-serviceman, huh?
Greetings, brother. Have you
had any trouble getting readjusted?
Not in particular. It's easy if you just
take everything in your stride.
That's what I've heard.
CLIFF: Be seeing you.
- I doubt it.
- When did you pick him up?
- I told you. He's an old friend.
He just dropped in for a friendly drink.
- Did you know him while I was away?
MARIE: I knew lots of people.
What do you think I was doing
all those years?
- I don't know, babe, but I can guess.
- Go ahead, guess your head off.
I could do some guessing myself.
What were you up to in London
and Paris and all those places?
[SCOFFS]
I've given you every chance
to make something of yourself.
I gave up my own job
when you asked me.
I gave up the best years of my life.
And what have you done?
You've flopped. Couldn't even hold that job
at the drugstore.
So I'm going back to work for myself.
That means I'm going to live
for myself too.
And in case you don't understand English,
I'm gonna get a divorce.
What have you got to say to that?
Don't keep Cliff waiting.
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm going away.
- Where?
- As far away from Boone City as I can get.
That's a good idea.
You'll get a good job someplace else.
There are drugstores everywhere.
Here's an old sweater I found.
- Remember you wore it in high school?
- Sure.
- You might need it sometime.
- Thanks, Hortense.
- You forgot these, son.
- Oh, I don't want them, Pop.
What are they?
Just a lot of fancy words that don't mean
anything. You can throw them away.
Say, these are citations for your medals.
Why, Freddy,
you never showed them to us.
Those things came in the packages
of K rations.
Well, we'll treasure them, my boy.
I'll get the socks I washed for you.
- Think you're doing the right thing, son?
- You mean going?
Who's to say in advance whether
it's the right thing or the wrong thing?
It just means a fresh start
in some other place.
How do you know
it'll be different anyplace else?
There's a need here for fellas like yourself
that fought and won the war.
[FRED SCOFFS]
I know you haven't had the best of breaks
since you got back...
...but, well, it seems like
you ought to stick here...
...and slug it out a while longer
on your own home ground.
You're all right, Pop.
But I know when it's time to bail out.
I gotta get going.
- Here are your clean socks, Fred.
- Oh, just put them in here.
- Take good care of the old man, won't you?
<i>- I'll</i> do my best.
- But we'll miss you, Freddy.
- You ought to be used to that by now.
So long, Pop.
[TRAIN WHISTLE WAILING]
I'll tell you, captain.
We've got two flights going out tonight.
One eastbound, one westbound.
You'll have to ask the pilot.
- Which way you going?
- Which one leaves first?
Eastbound, 8:00.
That'll be fine.
I'll just hang around the field until then.
Say, you don't seem to care
where you're going.
That's right, chum. I don't.
Hortense.
Hortense! Listen to this. Sit down.
"Headquarters, Eighth Air Force.
Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross."
Um, here.
"Despite intense pain,
shock and loss of blood...
...with complete disregard
of his personal safety...
...Captain Derry crawled
back to his bombsight...
...guided his formation
on a perfect run over the objective...
...and released his bombs
with great accuracy.
The heroism, devotion to duty,
professional skill...
...and coolness under fire
displayed by Captain Derry...
...under the most difficult conditions,
reflect highest credit upon himself...
...and the Armed Forces
of the United States of America.
By command
of Lieutenant General Doolittle."
MAN:
Hey, bud, what are you doing up there?
Hey, you!
What are you doing in that airplane?
I used to work in one of those.
Reviving old memories, huh?
Yeah, or maybe getting some of them
out of my system.
Well, take your last look at these crates.
We're breaking them up.
Yeah, I know. You're the junkman.
You get everything sooner or later.
This is no junk.
We're using this material
for building prefabricated houses.
You don't need any help, do you?
- Out of a job?
- That's it.
I see. One of the fallen angels
of the Air Force.
Well, pardon me if I show no sympathy.
While you glamour boys were up
in the wild blue yonder...
-...I was down in a tank.
- Listen, chum.
Sometime I'll be glad to hear
the story of your war experiences.
What I asked you for was a job.
Have you got one?
Do you know anything about building?
No. But there's one thing I do know,
I know how to learn.
Same as I learned that job up there.
- Hey, Gus.
GUS: Yes?
See if you think this guy can be
of any use to us.
Thanks.
Now, children, let's remember the words.
The bride will come down those stairs.
And when I see her, I'll hit the first note...
...then I'll nod my head
and then we'll sing, hmm?
GIRL: Mm-hm.
- All right, let's try it.
- Here she comes.
BOY: Here.
No, wait for the note.

- How do you do, Mr. Stephenson?

Gee, Fred, you had me worried.
I heard you were leaving town.
- I was afraid you wouldn't stand up for me.
<i>- I'll</i> stand up for you, kid, till I drop.
Heh, oh, uh, Fred, uh, here's the ring.
Don't lose it.
AL: Hi, Homer. Big day, huh?
- Hi, Al.
- Hi, Fred.
- Hello, Al.
I, uh...
- I hear you moved back with your folks.
- Yeah.
I've been sampling the punch.
I presume it was made for the kiddies.
- Will you have some, Homer?
- Uh, I'd better not, Al.
- I might give the wrong answers.
- Heh. How about you, Fred?
No, thanks. Maybe later.
Well, if I must be a solitary drinker,
good luck, kid.
Thank you, Al.
- Al. You promised you wouldn't.
- Hmm. Now, listen, darling.
- Take a sip.
- Hello, Fred. Homer.
You'll realize there isn't a headache
in a barrel of it.
Don't worry about Al,
Mrs. Stephenson, he can take it.
- He certainly can.
FRED: Excuse me.
Here, see for yourself.

PEGGY:
Hello, Fred.
- Nice to see you again.
- Hello, Peggy. Nice to see you.
Well, what have you been
doing with yourself lately?
Working.
Yes, uh...
Dad told me he heard
you were in some kind of building work.
Well, that's a hopeful way of putting it.
I'm really in the junk business.
An occupation for which many people feel
I'm well qualified...
...by temperament and training.
It's fascinating work.
- Where's Homer? Wilma's ready.
<i>- I'll</i> get him. Excuse me.
Come on, children. Mary, Kay, go ahead.
Children. Jackie. Jackie!

<i>For eternity</i>
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God...
...and in the face of this company...
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.
If any man can show just cause why they
may not lawfully be joined together...
...let him now speak,
or else here after forever hold his peace.
Homer, wilt thou have
this woman to thy wedded wife?
I Will.
Wilma, wilt thou have
this man to thy wedded husband?
I Will.
Who gives this woman
to be married to this man?
I do.
Now, Homer, will you take Wilma's
right hand in yours and say after me.
I, Homer, take thee,
Wilma, to my wedded wife.

To have and to hold from this day forward.

Place it on the fourth finger
of Wilma's left hand.
Repeat after me.
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.
MINISTER:
Those whom God hath joined together...
...let not man put asunder.
For as much as Homer and Wilma have
consented together in holy wedlock...
...and have witnessed the same
before God and this company...
...and thereto have given and pledged
their troth, each to the other...
...and have declared the same
by giving and receiving a ring...
...and by joining hands...
...I pronounce that they are man and wife.
God bless you both.
[ALL CHATTERING AND LAUGHING]
You know what it'll be, don't you, Peggy?
It may take us years to get anywhere.
We'll have no money,
no decent place to live.
We'll have to work, get kicked around...
