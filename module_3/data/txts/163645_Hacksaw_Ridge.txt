Desmond, hang on!
Hang on, Desmond!
We're going to
get you out of here!
Desmond. Desmond!
What?
Wait up.
Catch up.
Wait up, I've got
something to tell you.
What, hal?
Race you to the top.
Hey! Cheater!
See you later, slowpoke.
Hey!
Want a hand?
I got it.
Sit down!
Quit it.
You quit it.
For Pete's sake.
Hey!
Get away from that ledge,
you damn fool kids!
You're going to
break your necks!
It's them doss kids.
Crazy as their old man.
They dug up the corner of
Jackson and main...
Putting in a sidewalk...
You boys wouldn't
recognize it now.
Mind you,
i doubt they'd recognize you.
They hardly know me
when I walk by 'em.
It's like I died with you.
It's like we boys
never existed.
Well, that's all I got
for you today.
Block him
with your right, Desmond.
Stop it! Do you hear me?
What are they
fighting about?
When'd they ever need
a reason?
Tom! Ugh!
Why stop 'em?
Saves me whipping them both.
This way,
i just whip the one
that wins.
Tom! No!
Oh, god.
Tom! Wake up,
can you hear me?
What the hell have you done?
He can't hear me.
I got it.
I'll get some ice.
You shift that basket.
I got it.
Is he breathing?
Hal? Hal, can you hear me?
Hal, can you hear me?
Hal... come on.
He's dilated.
Hal...
What do you think
you're doin'?
I'm gonna have to
beat you now,
you know the rules.
You hear me, Desmond?
Desmond!
Tom, stop.
What's that gonna teach
the boy?
He's violent enough already.
Okay, fine,
you go smother him
in kisses.
You tell him the world's
a soft and gentle place.
Hal's gonna be okay.
Hey.
I could have killed him.
Yes, you could have.
Murder, it's the worst sin
of all.
And to take
another man's life,
that is the most
egregious sin
in the lord's sight.
Nothing hurts
his heart so much.
Don't you understand English?
Do I have to
tell you again?
You move, woman,
or I will wallop
you good and hard!
What the hell's
going on?
You okay, Bertha?
You mind
your own damned business!
Go sleep it off, tom.
I hate him.
Momma?
Oh.
Why does he hate us
so much?
Oh, he don't hate us.
He hates himself sometimes.
Your daddy tonight...
That ain't the real him.
I wish you knew him
like I did, before the war.
How'd we sound, Desmond?
Like a heavenly host
of angels, mom.
Now, you know
it's a sin to tell a lie,
especially in this place.
Well, I ain't never said
they were singing angels.
What's going on
out there? Desmond!
Get it up, get it up!
Drag him out.
Just the tarp.
I'll phone
an ambulance.
No, no time.
Joshua's pickup.
Quick!
Okay.
- You're going to be fine now.
- You're going to be fine.
You're in good hands.
What have we got here?
It's a severed artery.
Get some sutures.
Yes, doctor.
Put some pressure on it.
Did you apply
this tourniquet?
Yes, sir.
Nice work. You might have
saved this boy's life.
You staying with us?
You're going to be okay.
What's your name, son?
Gilbert.
- Surgery?
- Yeah, surgery.
Stay with us,
you're gonna be okay.
You feel pain?
Stay with us, okay?
Army physicals that way.
This is for giving blood.
Are you all right?
Oh, no,
that's not mine.
I'm fine.
Thank you for
asking though, ma'am.
What do you need?
My belt.
I lent it to the boy
who had the accident.
My pants don't hold up
so good without it.
Well, uh, I don't have
your belt.
No, I know that, ma'am.
It's out there.
It's right out there
with the boy still.
Okay.
I'm just here to take blood.
I'll give mine.
Okay, go to that room
over there and wait
with the others.
I'll call you.
That room.
You ever given
blood before, Mr...
Doss.
But my friends
call me Desmond.
No, ma'am,
this is my first time.
I always dreamed
about being a doctor.
But, uh, I didn't get
much school.
You may be a little dizzy
when we're done.
Is somebody picking you up?
No, ma'am.
Walking back.
Where do you live?
Fort hill, ma'am.
That's a ways.
No. Just five or six miles,
but I cut through the woods.
It's seven that way!
You must really
like the woods.
Yes, ma'am. Sure do.
Okay, put some pressure here.
You okay?
Yeah.
Bye.
Where you going
looking all spruced
and nice?
Met someone yesterday.
A nurse over at the hospital.
Her name's Dorothy schutte.
I'm gonna marry her.
Goodness.
Does she know that?
Well, not yet.
She's about to.
You ever even spoken
to a woman? I mean,
one that's not family.
Spoke to her.
Well, in that case,
come give your brother
a big hug.
Hal!
Come here.
Keep your greasy paws
off of me.
Wish me luck, momma.
Good luck.
Next.
Grab a seat.
You ever given blood before?
Yes, ma'am. I have.
You're the belt man.
Desmond, yes, ma'am.
Well, Desmond,
we can't take your blood
two days in a row.
Well, that's good.
I came to get mine back.
You what?
My blood.
I need it back.
Well, it don't work
like that, we can't just
give it back to you.
Well, you got to.
Ever since you stuck me
with that needle,
my heart's been
beating real fast.
Every time I think about you,
it beats faster still.
I never heard
that one before.
It's pretty corny.
It is?
That's a shame,
i done practiced that
all night.
No good?
I didn't say that.
What's the difference
between an artery and a vein?
What are you talking about?
The boy's accident.
Arteries spurt blood.
And veins?
Bleed.
I think you need to
practice your boy/girl
dating talk at home
before you come out.
Yeah, I probably do.
I'll give you a book
if you're that interested.
On dating?
On blood.
Another medical
question perhaps?
No. I just think
you're the prettiest thing
i ever seen.
That's because I'm sitting
in the dark.
No, you're just beautiful.
Out of the way!
You need to watch
where you're going.
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you'd mind.
You didn't ask.
I thought
you might have liked it.
Well, I might have
if you'd asked.
You coming?
Watch where
you're walking!
Why didn't you say
nothing to us?
'Cause you would have tried
and talked me out of it,
and I know
what I'm doing is right.
And what about
his commandment?
It's not killing in a war.
It's protecting.
Loads of boys
from our church are going.
Yeah.
There is a war
and they need men.
And working in a paper mill
ain't going to save
this country.
Looks like a movie star,
our boy.
Nice uniform, good hat.
Reminds me of how
Artie giddens looked
in his uniform
when we went to France.
Remember him, Bertha?
Don't, tom.
What?
I'm just saying how snappy
Artie looked in his uniform.
All you girls
certainly seemed to think so.
He had them flocking to him.
He was most proud.
I just hope that
when our hal gets shot,
it's through the front
of his jacket.
Like a simple entry wound,
not much mess.
Artie got hit in the back,
it blew most of his guts
and intestines out his front,
offal everywhere.
Wrecked his uniform entirely.
It was lucky he was dead,
so he never knew
how awful his uniform looked.
Get outta of my sight.
What are you,
part mountain goat?
Are you going to
help me, Desmond doss,
or are you just going
to leave me stranded?
I'll help you,
but it's gonna cost you.
What?
A kiss.
That is pure blackmail.
Well, yes, ma'am, it is.
But that is still
my condition.
That's the deal.
And I'm going to
hold you to it.
Well, hold on now.
You ain't gonna
slap me, are you?
'Cause I fall off,
I'm going to take you
with me.
Kiss me and find out.
What?
I have to enlist.
I can't stay here
while all of them
go fight for me.
Yes, you can.
You can stay here.
Dorothy, I have to.
I want to be a medic.
I figure
I'll be saving people,
not killing them.
I have to go to work.
I'm going to be late.
Dorothy, darling.
Dorothy. Dorothy!
So are you going to ask me
to marry you or what?
Well, I don't know.
You still going to have me?
Well, I wouldn't know,
you haven't asked.
Well, I'm asking you,
with all my heart
and then some.
Will you marry me?
Then, yes. Yes, I will.
When?
Soon as you get
your first leave.
But I still don't like you
at this moment.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay. Well, I love you.
Shh!
Momma said
come see you here.
Yeah.
These three
were my best friends.
I grew up with 'em,
I got into trouble with 'em,
chased girls with 'em.
And I enlisted with 'em.
Now my friends are there,
covered in dirt and grass
and eaten by worms.
I don't want to have
to visit my sons here.
Daddy, I signed up already.
I couldn't do otherwise, pop.
Everybody else is doing...
You ain't everybody else!
Everybody else jumps in
and does things quick,
without thinking!
Like the damn
idiot fools we were.
And soldiers who live,
they live because
they can do that!
You can't!
Look, you gotta sit
and think and pray
about everything!
I mean, look at you,
you're doing it right now.
You won't be able
to live with yourself
if you go.
No, I won't be able
to live with myself
if I don't.
I'm going to be a medic.
That's going to be
my way to serve.
See, there you go,
thinking it all out.
What, you figure this war
is just going to fit in
with you, your ideas?
Well, I don't doubt
it's going to be hard.
It won't be hard,
it'll be impossible.
You know,
whatever beliefs you have
in your crazy head now,
they won't ever play out.
It don't work that way.
And if by some, I don't know,
miracle chance you survive,
you won't be giving
no thanks to god.
- Ready?
- Ready.
We all need
some air.
Come on, fellas, shake a leg.
Uncle Sam's got you now.
Say goodbye to momma.
Come on.
Ladies, please,
step away from the bus.
- I almost forgot. Here.
- Do I need a crowbar?
I want you
to have this.
It's mine.
You keep it right here,
where I'll be.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I love you.
Hey,
don't say that about my girl.
Hey. Oh.
Hey. Sorry, pal.
Means you're the person.
- I can't believe...
- Nah, it's just a bump.
Do I have to gaze
at your deformity
every time I walk to my bed?
Gaze upon it in envy,
my friend.
You okay there?
You look lost.
Vacancy right here.
Wise choice.
It's got views
of the mountains
down to the lake.
Randall Fuller.
Desmond doss.
Call him "teach."
No one understands
a word he says.
That's because
no one else here can read.
The testicles there
belong to a man
calling himself "Hollywood."
They look like they belong
to a smaller guy.
You know testicles.
Oh! Hey, I just got
these shoes.
Hey, uh, grease Nolan,
outta red hook.
Where you from?
Virginia.
Ooh, hillbilly, huh?
You marry your first cousin?
I'm just joking.
Oh!
That's smitty over there,
whipping kirzinski's ass.
Like you were doing
any better, chowderhead.
Hey, I didn't want to
embarrass you.
Wal kirzinski,
nice to meet you.
Hey, beanpole,
what did you say
your name was?
Desmond doss.
That's Tex Lewis over there,
he thinks he's
some kind of cowboy.
And, uh, vito rinnelli.
He may be small,
but he is a bulldog.
Hey.
How you doing?
Desmond.
Yeah.
This handsome guy
right here is lucky Ford.
Hey.
That's Walker and pinnick
over there pretending
they're card sharks.
Pipe down, grease,
all right?
Unless you want to
put your money
where your mouth is.
Oh, hey,
the old good book, right?
I think lucky's got
a good book.
Right, lucky?
It's a good read.
Attention!
Line up!
Move it!
Let's go, move it. Move it.
You are a very
strange-looking individual
if you don't mind me
saying so, private.
Name?
Andy Walker.
How long
have you been dead, son?
Sir?
I am not "sir"!
I am sergeant howell
or sarge.
"Sir" you save
for useless people.
The name is "ghoul,"
you say?
Walker, sergeant!
Ghoul it is.
Yes, sergeant!
There's something off
in your presentation,
private.
Can't place it.
Is it your hair?
Is it the wrinkle
in your trousers?
I have a knife
in my foot, sergeant.
Oh, yes, of course,
that's it. The knife.
What is your name, soldier?
Smitty Ryker.
No, your name
is private idiot.
Do you know why?
Because I have a knife
in my foot.
Who placed
the knife there, private?
It was an accident, sarge.
We was playing stretch.
I am heartened
by the knowledge
you did not place it there
with intention.
Who threw the knife?
I did, sergeant.
Private kirzinski.
You look part Indian.
To what tribe
do you belong, son?
No, I'm Polish.
Wrong. I believe
you must have cherokee
or shawnee
blood in you.
No, sergeant.
Are you contradicting me,
you wagon-burning
son of a bitch?
No, sergeant!
Let me see
your Indian war cry, son.
I don't...
Louder! Let me see it.
What is your animal spirit?
Are you a garter snake?
No, sergeant!
Are you a chipmunk?
No, sergeant!
Are you
a dancing reindeer?
No, sergeant!
Are you
contradicting me, private?
No, sergeant!
Good.
Then I shall henceforth
call you "chief"
as a sign of great respect
to your people.
Thank you, sergeant!
Are you grinning
at me, boy, or is that
your natural state?
No, sergeant.
Name, private?
Desmond doss.
I have seen stalks of corn
with better physiques.
Makes me want to pull
an ear off, private.
Can you carry your weight?
Yes, sergeant!
Should be easy
for you, then.
Corporal, make sure
you keep this man away
from strong winds.
Yes, sergeant.
Private idiot.
Yes, sergeant.
Raise your foot. Higher.
Everyone outside.
Now! Move it.
I said move it.
All right. Just getting in
my uniform, sarge.
Did I ask him to, corporal?
No memory of it, sarge.
I believe any man
who takes such pride
in his natural naked state
will surely enjoy
the brisk of the outdoors.
Now move your privates,
private parts!
Move it!
You son of an exhibitionist.
I am going to
teach you how to tie
a bowline knot,
so you can get
your sorry asses
down from a height,
so I may then kick them!
Create a loop.
This is the rabbit hole.
The rabbit comes out
of his hole,
runs around the tree,
goes back into the hole.
All right, let's go!
Very good, Tex.
Keep struggling, teach.
Have you ever roped a goat,
Hollywood?
No, sarge.
Have you ever looked
into a goat's eyes?
No, sarge.
Good, that would be
unnatural.
You know if you
don't breathe, you'll die.
Mmm-hmm.
Good, private idiot.
Congratulations, greaseball,
you just fell 50 feet
and broke your neck!
Brilliant,
private vito rinnelli.
You strangled yourself,
numb nuts!
Are you a fan of Benito?
No, sergeant.
A bit taller.
If you were American,
you'd be taller.
What've we got here, doss,
one for each titty?
You were tying
a bowline, boy,
not building a bra!
What is so funny, corporal?
Couldn't tell you, sergeant.
Come on!
Come on, ladies, pick it up!
Move it! Move it!
I want to see some fire here.
A little hustle.
Show me something!
Run like you mean it!
Down, down, down!
Faster, faster!
Come on. Move it! Move it!
Let's go,
it's bath time, boys!
It's bath time!
Move! Move! Move!
I want to see you work.
Let's go!
Dig, dig, dig!
Don't forget
behind your ears.
Let's go. Move!
I bet you're enjoying this,
you naked degenerate.
Let's go! Hustle.
Hustle. Hustle. Move!
Let's go!
What are we waiting on?
Let's go! Move your ass!
Get the wood! Get the wood!
Don't get splinters!
Drive!
Drive!
Jeez, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Move!
Move!
Come on, move!
What the hell
is wrong with you?
No one said take a rest!
Move your asses
to the finish line!
Move! Move!
Hustle! Hustle!
Get your asses
across that line!
Nice work, doss!
This is
a personal gift from
the United States government
to each
and every one of you.
A standard issue U.S. rifle,
caliber .30, m1,
a clip-fed, shoulder-fired,
semi-automatic weapon
designed to bring death
and destruction to the enemy.
This is to be your lover,
your mistress,
your concubine.
Perhaps the only thing
in life you will ever
truly love.
Fellas, let's dance.
Grab a girl.
Don't point
your gun forward.
I do not want
to be shot today.
No matter how much
you are tempted.
Place the weapon
by your side.
Pay attention.
Problem, private corn stalk?
Is there not one
in your size, or is it
the color that is the issue?
No, sarge.
I was told
i don't have to carry
a weapon.
Come again?
Step forward, private.
I can't be hearing
this right.
Well, I'm sorry, sergeant.
I can't touch a gun.
What exactly is the problem?
No problem,
just a mistake, sir.
I told the army
when I joined up.
That's not possible.
Do you know why
it's not possible, private?
No, sir.
Because the United States
army does not make mistakes.
So if there's a problem,
you must be that problem.
I was just never
supposed to be sent
to a rifle company.
He's a C.O., sir.
You're a conscientious
objector, and you joined
the army?
Well, no, sir,
I'm a conscientious
cooperator.
Are you
screwing with me, doss?
No. No, sir.
I volunteered.
I ain't got no problem
with wearing my uniform,
or saluting the flag
and doing my duty.
It's just carrying a gun
and the taking of human life.
You don't kill?
That's all.
Yes, sir, that's all.
You know quite a bit
of killing does occur
in a war?
Yes, sir.
I mean, that is the essential
nature of war.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Do you have any
other requirements
of the United States army?
Is there anything else
that we can do to ensure
that you have
a comfortable stay
here with us?
He doesn't want to work
on Saturdays, sir.
Well, Saturdays...
I'm a seventh-day adventist.
So, Saturday is my sabbath,
so I'm not allowed
to work then.
I don't think
that poses a problem,
do you, sergeant?
We shall simply ask the enemy
not to invade on the sabbath,
'cause private doss here
is at prayer.
All right.
Now we got that clear.
Now let me tell you
my requirements.
They're not
as complicated as yours.
They're very simple.
As long as you're
in this company,
under my command,
you will obey
my orders. Period.
If you can't do it here,
i can't trust you
to do it in battle.
I'm putting you in
for a section 8,
psychiatric discharge.
Dismissed!
Gentlemen!
I want you to meet
private Desmond doss.
Apparently, private doss
does not believe in violence.
He does not
practice violence.
He will not even deign
to touch a weapon.
You see, private doss
is a conscientious objector.
So I plead with you,
do not look to him
to save you
on the battlefield,
because he will undoubtedly
be too busy wrestling with
his conscience to assist.
Sarge, that's not true.
Private, as you were.
Now, I realize some of you
might have strong feelings
about this.
It is what we men fight for.
To defend our rights,
and to protect
our women and children.
Even if private doss' beliefs
might cause women
and children to die.
So I will expect everyone
in this company
to give private doss
the full measure
of respect he is due
for the short time
he will be with us.
Am I clear?
Yes, sergeant.
What'cha got there, dessie?
You know what that is.
It just seems kind of small.
It's half the Bible
for half the man.
For Pete's sake, smitty,
give him back his Bible.
I don't remember
speaking to you.
So, how come you don't fight?
You think you're better
than us?
No.
What if you was attacked?
Whoa!
Say, like that.
The Bible says to turn
the other cheek, don't it?
See, I don't think
this is a question
of religion, fellas.
I think this is cowardice,
plain and simple.
Is that right, doss?
Are you chickenshit,
that it?
Go on, take a poke.
Tell you what,
I'm going to give you
a free shot.
Right there.
Hit me, doss. Go on.
- Let him have it.
- Go ahead.
No?
Chickenshit.
Oh.
What is this?
Give me that.
This is a fine-looking broad.
Nice.
Hey, pass it around.
Now, this would be
the kind of broad
that deserves a real man.
Give me that back.
Please.
Please.
"Please give it back,
smitty."
Please give it back, smitty.
Do you hear voices, Desmond?
No, sir.
But I understand
that god talks to you.
Is that right?
Sir, I'm not a crazy person.
Is that how you feel
most people regard you,
a crazy person?
I'm different.
I know that.
But I'm not going to pretend
to be something I'm not.
I am what I am.
Sounds lonely.
You lonely?
So, you don't hear voices.
No, sir.
I pray to god and I like
to think he hears me,
but it ain't a conversation,
like the one
we're pretending to have
right now.
Pretending, private?
Well, yes, sir.
I know all you really want
to do is give me a section 8,
drum me out of the army,
but I'm not off up above.
I just simply believe
what I believe.
Well, I'm trying to
understand, all right?
Was it god who told you
not to pick up a rifle?
God says not to kill.
That's one of his
most important commandments.
Most people
take that to mean,
"don't commit murder."
War is a completely
different set
of circumstances.
Jesus said,
"a new commandment
i give unto you,
"that you love one another,
just as I have loved you."
This is Satan himself
we're fighting.
Surely, as a good Christian,
you can see that.
I can see that, sir,
and that is why I joined up.
But I'm sorry,
i will not bear arms.
His religious views
are certainly unique,
but they do not
constitute grounds
for a section 8 discharge.
How am I supposed to
maintain discipline
with a man like that
in my unit?
I don't know.
But he is a legitimate
conscientious objector,
and he must be allowed
to work as a combat medic,
provided he qualifies
in all other areas
of his training.
Perhaps we could help
make believe in his idea.
Yeah, you restrict him
to barracks and kp.
If he throws god at you,
you throw hell right at him.
I want him gone.
Doss, your area
is a disgrace.
It's a pig sty!
Something funny, Ryker?
No, sarge!
You got some
shit on your mind?
No, sarge!
What you men
fail to recognize
is a unit is no better
than its weakest member!
Now, to help you
learn that lesson,
there will be no passes
this weekend.
You will all be on kp!
Right now,
everybody in full gear
for a 20-mile hike.
Let's go! Let's go.
Get your heads right.
Don't start feeling sorry
for yourself.
Makes me sick
see you feel sorry
for yourself.
You dogs don't know
what tired is.
We're going to
keep going till I drop.
Hey, knock it off.
Trying to sleep here.
Get off me. Get off me.
Okay. All right.
Why the hell
are you still here?
As you were.
Where's doss?
This isn't good for anybody.
Sure ain't
what I joined up for.
It's not about what
you joined up for.
It's about the lives
of every man in here.
And yours, son.
It's time to quit this.
Finish getting dressed
and I'll walk you down.
It's okay, doss.
There's no shame in this.
Let's go.
I got extra guard duty today,
and I'm on kp
this morning, so...
Can't.
All right, doss.
Private doss,
can you identify the men
that beat you?
No, sarge.
Are you saying
that you don't know
who attacked you?
I never said
i was attacked, sarge.
Well, what the hell
are you saying, doss?
You bruised half
your body sleeping?
I... I sleep pretty hard.
If you plan on
getting wet this weekend,
make sure you put on a hat.
Next.
Don't want anyone
coming back pissing cream.
What, you don't want none
for your coffee, sarge?
How about a shot
right now, smitty?
You speaking
from experience, sarge?
Next.
You'd have to ask
your mom about that,
greaseball.
Move!
At ease.
Private doss, I'm afraid
i can't authorize your pass.
This is a furlough for men
who have passed
the basic training.
Well, sir, respectfully,
sir, I have.
I put in for this furlough
three weeks ago.
I'm getting married
this afternoon.
It says you're not
rifle qualified.
Well, I'm not required
to carry a rifle, sir.
Colonel stelzer, he...
Colonel stelzer's
determination was...
"Doss must be allowed to
work as a combat medic,
"provided he qualifies
in all other areas
of his training."
And you have not qualified
on the rifle range, private.
Pretty clear.
Show me you know
how to handle a rifle
and I'll sign your furlough.
Corporal Cannon.
Sir!
Hand private doss
your firearm.
I won't touch a rifle, sir.
I'm not asking you, private!
That is a direct order
from a company commander.
For god's sake, doss,
you stop this nonsense
and quit.
Refuse, and I will have
no recourse but
to court martial you,
and you will spend
the duration of the war
in a military prison.
I can't, sir.
How much longer would you
like to wait, Dorothy?
I think it's been
long enough.
I'm so very sorry.
Sometimes men just get
cold feet.
Some men might.
Not my Desmond.
You probably think
I'm a real son of a bitch
who cares only
about regulations
and not his men.
May I?
I believe in this book
as much as any man.
And just like any man,
i wrestle with my conscience,
but what do you do
when everything you value
in this world
is under attack?
I don't know, sir.
I ain't got answers
to questions that big,
but I also feel
like my values
are under attack,
and I don't know why.
I don't give a rat's ass
about your principles
because the japs don't.
If one of them attacks you
and some wounded soldier,
what are you gonna do?
Hit him with your Bible?
I'm prepared to give
my life for my men.
You don't win wars
by giving up your life.
Look, I'm only here because
i don't want to see you
rotting in a prison cell.
Plead guilty, throw yourself
at the mercy of the court.
Maybe they'll let you
go home and pray.
Let the brave men out there
go and win this war.
If I can't convince you,
maybe she can.
They wouldn't let me
call you.
I knew
it wasn't your making.
What have they done
to you?
It's okay,
I'm all right.
I just went a couple of
rounds with the wall
and lost.
They're saying you could
go to prison, Desmond.
Leavenworth.
There must be
some other way.
I don't know
what that could be.
I've done
everything they asked me,
except this one thing,
and I'm being treated
like a criminal
just 'cause I won't kill.
You tried.
Nobody can say you didn't.
But who are you
going to save in prison?
Probably nobody.
Then why can't you just
pick up the stupid gun
and wave it around?
You don't have to use it,
just meet them halfway.
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
It's just pride.
Pride and stubbornness.
Don't confuse your will
with the lord's.
Have I been prideful?
Maybe I am prideful.
But I don't know how
I'm going to live with myself
if I don't stay true
to what I believe.
Much less how
you could live with me.
I'd never be the man
that I want to be
in your eyes.
I fell in love with you
because you weren't
like anyone else
and you didn't try to be.
Do not think for one moment
that you will disappoint me.
I will love you
no matter what.
I don't know
what he's gonna do.
He loses no matter what.
<i> They want him</i>
<i> to plead guilty,</i>
<i> but then he'll get</i>
<i> a dishonorable discharge.</i>
Otherwise he fights them,
and he for sure
goes to prison.
<i> Either way,</i>
<i> they'll call him a coward</i>
<i> and I don't see how</i>
<i> he can live with that.</i>
Well, thank you, Dorothy.
If you get to talk to him,
tell him that we love him
and that we're praying
for him.
<i> We're praying</i>
<i> for both of you.</i>
I will. Bye-bye.
<i> Tom,</i>
<i>you're out of your mind,</i>
<i>you're delirious.</i>
<i> Of course</i>
<i> I'm out of my mind.</i>
What do you think I am?
I'm out of my mind.
You leave this room.
Oh, god! Put it down!
Get away from me, woman.
Hey!
I got that, sir.
May I help you, sir?
I wish to speak to
brigadier general musgrove.
Not without
an appointment you can't.
That would be
quite impossible.
Uh, if you would
kindly tell him
corporal Thomas doss
would appreciate
a brief word.
He's in a very
important meeting.
I fought with him
in France at belleau wood.
He was my captain.
Please, ma'am,
it's most vital.
Thank you, ma'am.
There's a man out there,
tom doss.
Doss?
Be over in a minute.
You'll be home
safe and sound,
like nothing ever happened.
I love you.
This is a hearing
into the matter of
private Desmond doss.
The charge is disobeying
a series of direct orders
from his commanding officer.
How says the defendant?
Private doss wishes to enter
a "not guilty" plea.
Is that so, private?
I thought this was agreed.
You wanted to enter
some sort of plea bargain.
Yes, sir,
but I changed my mind.
Just like that?
You wish to proceed
to a court-martial?
Yes, sir.
Ah.
Well, on your head,
then, private. Proceed.
Your honor, private doss
waves his morality at us
like it's some kind of
badge of honor.
He flaunts his contempt
by directly disobeying
a series of direct orders
from his commanding officer.
When the very best of
our young men are sacrificing
their lives against...
You okay?
Yes.
Are they still deliberating?
Yes, sir.
Okay, now you go
take this in there.
I can't. It's strictly
military personnel.
Well, then you get
one of them to take it in.
They ain't out to help.
They're fixing to bury him.
There is only one question
that any military court
need ask of the accused.
Do you deny disobeying
colonel sangston's
direct orders?
Well, do you, private?
No, sir. I don't.
Why are you
contesting it, then?
Why is it so important
to you, given your refusal
to even touch a weapon,
to serve in a combat unit?
Because when the Japanese
attacked Pearl harbor,
I took it personal.
Everyone I knew was
on fire to join up,
including me.
There were two men
in my home town
declared 4-f unfit.
They killed themselves
because they couldn't serve.
I had a job
in a defense plant
and I could've taken
a deferment,
but that ain't right.
It isn't right that other men
should fight and die,
that I would just be
sitting at home safe.
I need to serve.
I got the energy
and the passion
to serve as a medic.
Right in the middle
with the other guys.
No less danger, just...
While everybody else
is taking life,
I'm going to be saving it.
With the world so set
on tearing itself apart,
it doesn't seem like
such a bad thing to me
to want to put a little bit
of it back together.
Hmm.
Sorry, sir,
nobody's allowed
to go...
No, you don't understand.
My son is the defendant.
I understand, sir,
but nobody's allowed...
I have information
that's important.
Sir, you are not allowed...
While the sentiments
expressed are laudable,
the facts of the charge
seem incontestable, so...
What the hell
is going on out there?
Let him go.
- That's a great war uniform.
- It is, sir.
Sir, I need to show you this.
With respect, sir,
you are no longer
a member of the military.
You are unable to
attend this hearing.
I'm sorry.
Is that truly
the way it works, sir?
You fight for your country,
you lose so much
that was dear to you,
and then you're done with?
The uniform is forgotten.
You have no voice.
You were at lys?
I was, sir.
And at belleau wood.
Twice decorated,
i see.
Yes, sir.
I take it you are
the private's father.
I am, sir. Thomas doss.
Then, as a former
military man,
you know
there are laws here...
Sir, I know the law
and I know my son
is protected by those laws.
They are framed
in our constitution.
And I believe in them,
as he does.
They are why I went
and fought to protect them.
At least, that is what
i thought I was doing.
Because if it wasn't
for that,
then I have no idea
what the hell
i was doing there, sir.
Thank you, corporal doss.
Let me have the letter.
You must go.
"The defendant's rights
as a conscientious objector
"are protected by
an act of congress
"and he cannot be compelled
to waive those rights.
"That includes, in this case,
his disobeying orders
to bear arms."
Signed,
brigadier general musgrove,
war services commander,
Washington, D.C.
Colonel?
I withdraw the charges, sir.
Then this case is dismissed.
Private doss, you are free
to run into the hellfire
of battle
without a single weapon
to protect yourself.
You may resume your duties
and begin training
as a combat medic.
Where is he?
Gone. Straight after.
I begged him to stay.
I told him
you'd want to see him.
No, I understand.
When you get home,
you tell him I love him.
Okay. Okay.
You better come home to me.
Hollywood,
shut up.
Come on,
pipe down.
- Shut up, man.
- Shut up!
I swear to god, Hollywood,
i will shoot you.
Put a sock in it, will you?
Save the crowing
for when we get there.
Killjoy was here.
Give him room.
Clear!
Clear! Move aside!
The 96th...
Or what's left of them.
These are the guys
we're replacing.
- Seems good to me.
- Clear.
As gold.
Clear.
All clear, sarge!
Captain glover.
Lieutenant manville, 96th.
We've been assigned
to you, sir.
Okay.
Let's get these men
some chow.
Yes, sir.
This is, uh, sergeant howell.
Good to meet you, sir.
Sit down.
Who's doss?
Over there.
You doss?
Irv schecter.
You, and me and page here
are about the only medics
we got left in this area.
So, I guess we're gonna be
working together.
You just come off the line?
What's it like?
I said,
what's it like?
Hacksaw.
We climbed up six times.
Six times, they threw us off.
Last time, there wasn't
anything left of the 96th.
They're animals.
Stinking animals.
Nips don't care if
they live or die.
They want to die.
They keep coming at you.
And they ain't never
going to give up.
Never.
Here. Hey, buddy.
The japs
deliberately target
the wounded.
Lose all your
red cross markings.
Nips put a premium
on shooting medics.
The white is a bull's-eye.
Here, I got you
a new helmet.
One size fits all.
That's our objective.
Hacksaw Ridge.
We take it,
maybe we get okinawa.
We get okinawa,
we take Japan.
Take a breather.
Our pals in the Navy
are going to soften
them up for us.
Nobody can survive that shit.
Oh, but they can.
Lieutenant,
these bunkers here,
here and here,
is that accurate?
Yeah, there's three...
Yes, sir,
maybe a little further back,
but it's all...
It's all different up there.
<i> All clear, captain.</i>
Gents, move out.
It's blood.
No shit.
We're not in Kansas
anymore, Dorothy.
Keep climbing.
Here, come on.
Coming through,
make way. Out of the way.
Brown.
What?
Give this to jessop.
Corporal!
Incoming!
Get down!
Get down!
Where the hell are they?
I can't see nothing.
Beats me, pal.
Where the...
Medic, help!
We're over here.
Put your hand right here.
Put your hand on there, Jack.
Come on, come on.
Come on, we're going
to get you under cover.
Come on, come with me.
Come with me, Jack.
Keep moving forward!
Move!
I can't see anything.
Is that one?
I don't know. Just shoot!
All right, let's go.
Vito!
Oh, shit.
Medic! Vito's down!
I'm coming!
Okay. I'm here.
Get out of the way!
You hurt?
I'm fine.
Come on, I got you, Ralph.
Just breathe.
Just breathe.
Just breathe, Ralph.
It's okay. It's okay.
Just breathe, Ralph,
just breathe.
I got you, I got you.
I got you. Come on.
Hey! Hey!
Give him a shot of
morphine and move on.
He's not going to last a day.
Please.
Please, doss, no.
No. Don't leave me.
Don't leave me.
God, please don't leave me.
I've got kids!
Please. Please, don't.
Please, don't leave me.
I ain't going anywhere.
I'm going to get you home.
I got you, Ralph. Okay?
I'm going to get you home.
Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.
It's going to kick
in real quick, Ralph.
We're going to
get you shifted.
Stretcher! Stretcher!
Get up. Keep moving, son.
I can't, I'm wounded.
There's nothing wrong
with you.
Shit! Hang on, kid.
Move. A sitting duck's
a dead one.
Move. Go, go, go!
This guy's a priority.
We got him, we got him.
Here. Easy, now.
A priority?
You ever heard of triage?
He'll be dead
before we get him down.
You don't know that.
Get him down. All right?
Huh?
Okay. Okay. Go.
Okay. Okay.
It's all right, buddy.
We're going to get you home.
Medic! Help! Help.
I figure if we can't
see them, then they can't
see us neither.
Help!
I got you, frank.
Where you hit?
I think they can
see us, smart ass.
Doss, come on, come on.
Give me a hand here.
Get down, sir.
Over there! The bunkers.
I see them.
Better stay down, sir.
I got 'em, dead ahead.
Yeah, I see 'em, too.
Push in as close as you can.
Give them everything
you've got.
I'll send in the
weapons team to flank them.
You keep that tight,
you're going to be right
as rain. All right?
I got him, doss.
I got him.
Here you go, come on now.
Come sit over here.
Hey.
You doing okay?
Okay.
And, fire!
Down!
Son of a bitch.
You, get on it.
Yes, sir!
Take 'em. Go. Fire!
Throw!
Cover!
Go, go. Go, ghoul.
Get in the hole.
Stay there.
Go, smitty, we'll cover you.
Leapfrog.
Cover.
Satchel!
Ghoul!
Clear.
Come on, stick it.
Stick it, ghoul.
Cover! Cover!
Son of a bitch.
Cover his ass.
Medic!
Medic! Help me.
Go!
Medic!
I'm here.
Put your hand on it.
Put your hand on it!
Go, go, go!
Ghoul. Ghoul.
You're okay. Where you hit?
You got a bump on the head,
that's okay.
What's your name?
Andy.
Andy what?
Andy Walker.
Also known as?
Ghoul.
Ghoul. Ghoul,
you're okay, you're okay.
Good job, men.
Good work.
Dig in for the night.
We hold this spot,
we mop up the rest
of the Ridge tomorrow.
Okay, boys. Find yourself
a nice safe hole
in or near the bunker.
Rotate watch
every two hours.
We don't know
what's out there.
Heads down, asses lower.
And shoot anything
that don't speak English.
Does that include
grease, sarge?
Particularly him.
I don't care if you need
to take a piss or a dump,
it ain't safe to
go out there alone.
Over here now!
Where the hell
are you going, doss?
Still more wounded
out there, sarge.
I'll go with him.
Be smart.
Keep your ears down.
All right,
let's find a spot.
Rinnelli
and Henry dead
in the first 15 minutes,
just straight off.
Straight off.
Peterson, popeye.
Standford and Murphy.
Page and unger.
Ralston.
"In peace,
sons bury their fathers,
"in war,
fathers bury their sons."
You wanna stop
spouting that crap?
It don't help none.
Yeah, you got that right.
Not here.
Hey, give me that.
Hey, we've got
an abdominal wound.
This man is going
to need some plasma.
- You got it.
- Leave him with us.
Okay. You're okay now.
They got you.
Should we find a hole
and dig in?
Sounds good to me.
Put your helmet on.
You ain't going to
eat them?
I don't eat meat.
Help yourself.
Of course you don't.
That's one heck of a dame.
You know you're fighting
out of your weight class
with her, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Don't tell her that.
She'd be much happier
with a man like me anyway.
Yeah, until she got to
know you.
I'm an asshole sometimes.
Sometimes?
Yeah, all right. All right.
These japs
are sneaky.
I'll take first watch,
all right?
You get some shut-eye.
Hell of a dream.
Dreamed I got
myself skewered.
I couldn't do nothing.
Rifle's just there.
It won't bite.
Yeah, it will.
Look around you.
After what we've
just been through,
any sane man would be
screaming for a weapon.
I never claimed to be sane.
My daddy's a drunk.
He fought it for years,
but it kind of got
a hold of him hard.
Made him mean.
Least you knew him.
Mine could have been
any one of 10 guys,
and none of them
worth a damn, so...
So, your momma raised you?
I knew her, but she gave me
to an orphanage
when I was five.
Never saw her again.
I learned how to hate quick.
I learned how to
judge people quicker,
and I got you very wrong.
My daddy used to
beat me and my brother
just because the sun rose,
and then whip us
just because it set.
I could take that...
But when he would do it
to our momma...
Get away from me, woman!
That's enough.
No more. Do you hear me?
Pull the damn trigger.
Stop it! Stop!
But you didn't kill him?
In my heart, I did.
So that's why I made
my promise to god,
I ain't never going to
touch a gun again.
Well, I ain't
giving you mine,
'cause you're crazy.
Son of a...
Move, move!
Get your asses over here.
Let's go!
Fall back, fall back! Go.
They're coming
from underground.
Searchlight,
this is Baker six.
Request immediate support.
Target is at
yoke-tare-five-one-five.
Yes! Yes, I know
that's where the hell we are,
but I don't expect to
be here much longer!
I called an artillery strike.
Fall back. Move. Move!
Fall back!
Men, fall back!
Hey, buddy.
I'm right here. Right here.
Okay.
Cover me.
Go, go!
Get out of here, kid!
Come here, son.
You know what to do.
Keep pressure on it.
No! Don't need plasma.
Give it to him.
Over there.
I'll be okay. Go. Go.
Grease! Get Irv back.
What?
You got it, okay.
See you soon.
Come on. Come on.
We gotta move right now.
Come on, come on.
Go! Go! Go!
Change!
You better get the hell
out of here!
Move! Move!
I'm scared. I'm scared.
It's going to help the pain.
No, don't.
Don't you do that. Come on.
Come on,
smitty, you stay with me.
Let's go. We gotta move.
- Hey!
- Yeah.
Help me
get him down.
Help me get him down.
Yeah.
Come on, let's move.
Come on.
Can't help him, buddy,
he's gone.
No.
Come on!
We gotta get outta here!
Let's go!
Come on, let's go.
Come on. Everyone.
Off the Ridge!
What is it you want of me?
I don't understand.
I can't hear you.
Medic, help me! Help me!
Help me.
Help me, lord.
All right.
- You're in good hands.
- Easy does it. Easy.
Six... eight...
14.
Get these men
secured immediately.
Yes, sir.
Private Ford,
how many?
32 only came down, sir.
- Good lord.
- Let's go!
Let's load 'em up.
Yes, sir.
Harry. It's Desmond.
We going to fix you up.
You just got to
keep breathing. Okay?
Colonel wants to
see you, sir.
I need your Jeep.
You two stay here,
keep watch, keep your eyes
peeled for japs.
No, but...
Stay here! Keep watch.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Help. Help me.
Watch out.
I got you.
Put your hand on it.
Keep pressure on it.
I'm comin' back. Okay?
Okay.
Easy, fellas, easy.
Here we go.
Okay, guys, let's go.
On the count of three.
One, two, three.
Help, medic over here!
It's okay, buddy,
hold it together.
We're at the edge, Eric.
You just sit tight, okay?
You're okay, Eric.
You're okay, buddy.
Son of a gun,
this is going to work.
One for each leg, Eric.
We're going to get you
dressed up in a jiffy
and get you down.
I got you.
I got you now, Eric.
You have to
trust me now, Eric.
You'll have to trust me.
Japs!
Hold on, it's one of ours.
Hold on!
Let's go, let's go!
I got you.
I got you. I got you.
Come on, I got you.
You're okay. You're okay.
Hank, another one.
Colonel, call off
the artillery attack
on hacksaw.
Couldn't call it in.
There's still over
100 men left up there.
Tell them to call off
the artillery on hacksaw.
Sit down, Jack.
I'll get you a drink.
We just lost our cover.
They're stirrin',
we got to move. Come on.
- About time.
- They just keep coming.
- Pick it up.
- I got this.
Doss. Doss.
Help. Help me.
You're gonna have to
trust me. Take a breath.
Let's go, buddy. Let's go.
Jack, you don't know
if your men up there
are dead or alive.
You can't go back up there
without reinforcements.
You'll end up
killing the rest of them.
Then give me
the reinforcements.
I don't have any
fresh men, okay?
I don't have any troops.
Three battalions
got wiped out today.
It'll take more than a day
to get men in here.
I need them faster than that.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Everything's okay.
Morphine. It's good.
Pinnick, pinnick.
Pinnick. It's doss.
It's doss. Be quiet.
Be quiet. I got you.
Are you hit?
Yeah. I can't see.
Be quiet. Just be quiet.
Hold still now.
I got you. Hold tight.
There you go.
Try now. Try now.
I thought I was blind!
Shh... keep it down.
Can you walk?
I don't know.
We got to get out of here,
okay? Come on.
Good. Okay, we got you.
We got you.
Hey, Ted.
It's me, it's Desmond.
I'm gonna fix you up.
You ready to get out of here?
Sure am.
<i> Please, lord,</i>
<i> help me get one more.</i>
<i> Help me get one more.</i>
Please, help me get
one more.
One more.
Help me get one more.
One more.
Help me get one more.
One more.
Coming through.
Where the hell
are these guys coming from?
From hacksaw.
I thought
they pulled out.
Not all of them.
Some nut's up there
dragging wounded
from the top.
Even lowered
a couple of japs.
They didn't make it.
Back with you directly.
- Easy, easy.
- All set, move out.
Get in here.
There's nips everywhere.
Son of a bitch.
Private corn stalk.
You are nothing
if not full of surprises.
You want some morphine?
Hell, yes.
That or a bullet.
Okay.
There. There you go.
All right, let me see.
Let me see.
How's this doing?
Okay, not bad.
Let me see.
It looks much worse
than it is.
Girls will still
want to kiss you.
Sarge, you okay here
for a while?
Yeah, fine.
Get out of here.
I'm coming back.
You ready? Let's go.
You and me, come on.
Captain. There's something
you gotta see.
Our guys have been
coming down in droves
all night.
And Hollywood's here.
I never thought I'd see
that guy again.
Come on, follow me.
He's right here.
What the hell is this?
How you doing, sir?
Hey, cap.
Captain.
It's good to see you, kid.
Captain glover, sir.
How'd you get down, son?
Doss.
Howell's still up there.
What, howell
and doss did this?
Mostly just doss.
Just doss?
Just doss.
Yeah, doss, the coward.
You're like gum on a shoe,
ain't you?
Give me this.
It's a bit late for
target practice now,
don't you think?
Jump on it.
You're kidding.
No, I'm going to drag you.
Let's do it.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Let's go.
We got company.
Come on.
Arms up.
You gotta be
kidding me, corn stalk.
"You're tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra."
Come on.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
Get on.
- Put me down!
- Yes, sarge.
Sergeant howell.
Doss is still up there.
What the hell?
He's got japs on his tail.
We got him.
That's good. That's good.
It's okay,
we got him.
Whoa, whoa...
It's okay, doss.
Come on, doss, come on.
- You're safe.
- Come on, doss.
Desmond, it's all right,
it's all right.
Desmond.
Easy, easy. Here, come on.
Are you wounded?
Mmm...
No. No.
Let's get
this soldier to
a hospital tent, right now.
- Come on, easy now.
- Easy, easy.
Make some space.
We need someone
to come and clean up in here.
Where's Irv?
Irv? You mean,
schecter the medic?
Yeah.
He didn't make it.
He died of shock.
No plasma.
I'm sorry.
All I saw was a skinny kid.
I didn't know who you were.
You've done more than
any other man
could have done
in the service
of his country.
And I have never been
more wrong about someone
in my life.
I hope one day
you can forgive me.
We have to go
back up tomorrow.
I realize that
tomorrow is your sabbath.
Most of these men
don't believe
the same way you do.
But they believe so much
in how much you believe.
What you did on that Ridge
is nothing short of
a miracle,
and they want a piece of it.
And they're not going
to go up there without you.
<i> What the hell</i>
<i> is your delay, captain?</i>
<i> You were supposed to begin</i>
<i> that assault 10 minutes ago!</i>
We're waiting, sir.
Waiting for what?
For private doss
to finish praying
for us, sir.
<i> Private doss</i>
<i> is praying for you?</i>
<i> Who the hell</i>
<i> is private doss?</i>
Let's go to work.
Down.
Get down!
Get on the ground.
On the ground. Now!
Lay down, lay down.
I got the morphine.
Let's go,
let's get these men
out of here.
My Bible...
My Bible. My Bible...
Stop. Stop, stop,
stop. Stop!
My Bible, my Bible, my Bible.
Okay.
You're going home, Desmond.
We've taken hacksaw.
Hold up, hold up!
Desmond!
Desmond.
<i> I was praying the whole time.</i>
I just kept praying,
"lord, please help me
get one more."
When I got this, I said,
"lord, please help me
get one more."
<i> I would say anyone is wrong</i>
<i> to try to compromise</i>
<i> somebody's conviction.</i>
I don't care whether
it's army or what it is.
When you own a conviction,
that is not a joke.
That's what you are.
<i> Even though</i>
<i> I said those things</i>
<i> to him in regard</i>
<i> to carrying a rifle,</i>
and he would never be
by my damn side at all
unless he had a rifle.
<i> But then, in the long run,</i>
<i> finding out that</i>
<i> he was one of</i>
<i> the bravest persons alive.</i>
And then to have him
end up saving my life
was the irony of
the whole thing.
Blood had run down
to the fella's face and eyes.
He was laying there
just groaning
and calling for a medic.
I took water from my canteen,
got some bandage,
and I washed his face.
And when I was
washing his eyes,
his eyes came up.
Man, he just lit up.
He says,
"i thought I was blind."
And if I hadn't
got anything more
out of the war
than that smile he gave me,
I'd have been well repaid.
