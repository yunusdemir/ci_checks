Another village has died.
Let's go. This place, too, will soon sink\Ninto the Wasteland.
1000 years after the collapse of the giant\Nindustrial civilization, rust and ceramic\Nfragments covered the land.
Over this Wasteland, a deadly forest of\Nfungi spreads, releasing poisonous vapors.
The spread of this Wasteland threatens the\Nexistence of the remnants of the human race.
Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
Director: Hayao Miyazaki
An Ohmu track.
It's still fresh.
A shed Ohmu shell.
Magnificent.
I've never seen such a perfect shell.
Good sound.
It chipped a ceramic sword.
The Valley people will be happy.
They won't have to worry about materials\Nfor making tools for a long time.
What an amazing eye.
Maybe I can fly back with this one.
Got it.
It's so light.
The mushibayashi plants are spreading their\Nafternoon spores.
How beautiful.
Yet, this is a deadly forest.
If not for my mask, it would destroy my\Nlungs in five minutes.
Who –?
What can it be?
My heart is pounding.
It's an insect gun!
Someone is being attacked by the insects.
Sorry!
What?
A great pillar of spores.
Ohmu?!
It must be the one that shed that skin.
You can't escape that way.
Please, see the signal!
He answered! He's coming this way!
That's him –
What a splendid Ohmu.
To the windward side!
Thanks.
Ohmu, go back to your forest.
This side isn't your world.
See? Be a good child.
He's forgotten himself with anger.
I'll have to calm him down.
The Ohmu's been stunned by the flare!
An insect-whistle.
Ohmu, open your eyes.
Let's go home to the forest.
It's awake!
The Ohmu's returning to the forest.
With only flare bombs and an insect-whistle,\Nshe managed to calm the Ohmu.
Lord Yupa!
Nausicaa, you've grown!
It's been a year and a half!
Father will be ecstatic.
I must thank you.
You've become a fine wind-rider.
No, Father says not yet.
Oh, yes...
I completely forgot about this fellow.
Wow! A fox-squirrel. I've never seen one\Nbefore.
This fellow was kidnapped by a bird-louse.
I mistook him for a human baby and I ended\Nup using my gun.
So that's why the Ohmu was so angry.
It seems he didn't inhale any poison because\Nhe was unconscious.
No, you shouldn't put out your hand like\Nthat.
He's only a child, but still ferocious.
Come...
Hey...
There's nothing to fear.
Don't be afraid.
There's nothing to fear.
See?
You were only scared, weren't you?
Master Yupa, would you give him to me?
Ah – I won't mind, but –
Thank you.
Kai and Kui. Do you remember me?
Such a mysterious power.
Are you tired?
You've run a lot!
Is everyone the same?
What's the matter?
It's Father!
Father can't fly any more.
Jhil?
The forest's poison?
Yes.
It's the fate of all who live near the Wasteland,\NI'm told.
I should have visited earlier.
No.
It was really good of you to come.
Teacher!
Later, I want you to see something.
My secret room!
Don't tell anyone lest they be frightened.
I'll go on ahead to tell everyone you're\Ncoming.
You hurry, too.
Master Yupa!
Would you please carry this for me?
It disrupts the air currents so I can't\Nfly well.
My, she reads the wind well.
Come, just a little further.
Master Yupa!
Welcome!
Is everyone well?
Both water and wind are calm, without problems.
Master Yupa!
Ah, everyone's well, I hope?
It's Master Yupa.
We've been waiting for you, Master Yupa.
Princess! He's arrived!
Just a second.
Master Yupa!
Uncle Mito! Working hard, I see.
Tell us some more of those foreign stories\Ntonight!
OK. Turn it.
It looks good.
Yup.
Oh, it's a really good one.
We must set out first thing tomorrow to\Nget it.
Okay, Toeto?
Okay.
Master Yupa...
This is Toeto's child, who was born this\Nyear.
Oh, let me see.
She's a fine girl.
Reminds me of Nausicaa when she was young.
Would you please be this child's godfather?
So that a good wind will always blow for\Nher.
I accept. I'll give her a good name.
Thank you.
May she grow as healthy as the Princess.
Yeah.
If we're talking about health, the Princess\Nis famous for it.
But, it wouldn't do if the child imitated\Nthe Princess's playing in the Wastelands\Nas well.
But thanks to that, I found that Ohmu shell.
Well,
Put yourself in my shoes as the Steward.
I can't sleep easily at night from worry.
If we consider the Ohmu's shells,
we can't say that the Princess's playing\Nis for nothing.
That's true. I was rescued, too, wasn't\NI?
Saved by this child?
This valley is good.
Whenever I come here, my heart is soothed.
How were your travels this time?
It's terrible.
In the South, the Wasteland has swallowed\Ntwo more countries.
The Wastelands are steadily expanding.
Wherever I go, there's only hunger and warfare...
...and ominous shadows.
Why can't they live like you in this valley?
It's because here we are protected by the\Nblessed Wind that blows from the sea.
The poisons from the Wasteland cannot reach\Nthis valley.
How about it, Yupa?
Why don't you settle in this valley soon?
I'm in this condition.
Everybody would be glad.
That's impossible.
Yupa is a man destined to continue his search.
Destined, you say?
Grandmother,
What do you mean by "search"?
My, my... You didn't know, Nausicaa?
There – It's in that tapestry on the wall.
I can't see it any more...
...but, it's the Lord on the left corner.
"That one, wearing a robe of blue, shall\Ndescend onto a golden field."
"To forge once again the lost bond with\Nthe land."
"And lead everyone, at last, to a land of\Nblue purity."
Master Yupa,
I thought that it was only an old legend.
Grandmother! You vex us with your teasing.
Same thing, isn't it?
I only want to solve the riddle of the Wastelands.
Are we, the human race, destined to be swallowed\Nby the Wastelands and be destroyed?
I want to see and judge for myself.
If only I could help Master Yupa.
Princess.
Princess!
What is it, Mito?
Goll says he smells something in the wind.
It's almost dawn, isn't it?
I'll be right there.
Good work.
It's a good storm...
...but something's strange.
There!
There, again!
It's a plane.
Why would a plane be in a borderland like\Nthis?
What's happening?
Master Yupa!
It's a plane.
A plane?\NIt's coming!
It's huge!
It's a giant Torumekian ship!
It's flying strangely.
It's trying to make an emergency landing.
Goll! Get me up!
Princess!\NThat's absurd!
I'll guide them to the coast!
They've turned around!
Here goes!
Teto!
How could they?
They must have been in the Wasteland and\Nkilled some insects.
Raise your rudder!
You're going to crash!
Raise your rudder!
Your rudder!
It crashed. Princess –
It's at the seaside cliff.
Let's go!
Move it, let's go!
All who're able, hurry up!
It's that girl. She's alive.
Where?
The Valley of the Wind.
You mustn't speak.
I am...
...Rastel of Pejite.
The cargo...
Please burn the cargo.
The cargo?
Please – Burn it.
The cargo. I understand.
It's all right. Everything burned.
Thank God.
Princess!
This lady...
She's a princess of the royal house of Pejite.
An insect! An Ushiyabu is still alive!
Damn! It's calling other insects!
It's hurt and can't fly.
Bring your guns here!
That's no good! If we shoot, it'll call\Nmore of its kind!
I'll kill it on the first shot.
You can't kill an Ushiyabu with a gun!
Then what?
Wait.
Mito, bring Mehve, please.
Right.
Princess!
Go back to the forest.
It's all right! You can fly.
That's a good child.
Princess.\NThanks.
Thank God.
Who knows what would happen if we killed\Neven one of them?
Ohmu?
Found one!
Over here!
Here it is.
There were spores on that ship after all.
They haven't given off any poisons yet.
All in one effort.
Yup. If even one remains, it would be a\Ndisaster.
What do you suppose this lump is?
It didn't burn, even in that fire.
Well, everybody, we'll return to investigate\Nthis later.
Please go help burn the spores.
Let's go.
Be extra careful.
Really, what a mess they've dumped on us.
Mito...
Look here.
It's moving.
It's as if it's alive.
Master Yupa, what is this?
In my travels, I heard of an ominous rumor.
It said that a monster from the ancient\Nworld was excavated...
...from beneath the city of Pejite, where\Nit had been sleeping.
A monster from the ancient world?
It's a God Soldier.
A God Soldier?!
You mean, those that burned the world in\Nthe Seven Days of Fire?
This thing?
All the God Soldiers should have become\Nfossils by now.
But, this one managed to sleep underground\Nfor a thousand years.
Now that you mention it...
...it does seem to have human characteristics.
Torumekia is a large military state in the\Nfar West.
And, with these dead captives from Pejite...
It bothers me.
Please take care of the rest.
What can it be?
It's a Torumekian ship.
Everyone, to the castle!
Everyone! To the castle!
Everyone, head for the castle!
To the castle!
Father!
Hide, Grandmother.
I'll stay here.
Princess!
How could you?!
Nausicaa!
You! Don't move!
If you do, this knife, shaved from the shell\Nof an Ohmu...
...will pierce even your ceramic armor.
That man – It's Master Yupa.
I ask the Torumekian army.
Last night, the people of this valley worked\Nfuriously to save your ship.
Even now, we just finished carefully burying\Nthe dead.
Though it may have been a small thing, is\Nthis the courtesy of Torumekia towards such\Na country?
If you're starting a war, you should give\Na reason.
You should first send a messenger and state\Nyour complaints.
Nausicaa –
Calm down, Nausicaa.
If we fight now, everyone in the valley\Nwill be slaughtered.
We must remain alive and wait for our chance.
That wench!
Stop it, Kurotowa.
But –
Oh hell. What a bitch! She killed off everyone.
Your admonition pains my ears.
Aren't you Yupa Miralda, the best swordsman\Nin the borderlands?
Our objective is not massacre.
I want to talk.
I ask that you sheathe your sword.
It's the Princess!
Listen up!
These are the words of Her Highness Kushana,
Commander of the borderland expeditionary\Nforce of the Torumekian Empire!
We have come...
...to unite the borderland countries...
...to construct a land without worry.
You are on the verge of being engulfed by\Nthe Wastelands.
Obey us...
Cooperate in our undertaking!
Burn down the Wasteland!
Once again revive this land!
Burn down the Wasteland?
Is that possible?
We have revived the miraculous skills and\Npowers...
...that once made the human race the masters\Nof this planet.
To those who obey me...
I promise a life without fear of the forest\Npoisons or the insects!
Wait!
You must not raise a hand against the Wastelands!
Who is this old crone?
Hey! Take her away!
Let her speak.
In the thousand years since the birth of\Nthe Wastelands,
Humans have frequently attempted to burn\Ndown the poisonous forests.
But every time, a herd of Ohmu, maddened\Nwith anger,
...converged to become a giant wave that\Ncovered the land and came as a flood,
Destroying countries,
swallowing up cities...
The Ohmu continued to run until their own\Nlives ran out.
In due time,
Using Ohmu's corpses as the seed-beds, the\Nspores dropped their roots...
...and more lands were swallowed into the\NWastelands.
You must not touch the Wastelands.
Shut up!
I won't allow such raving.
Well, what will you do?
Kill me?
Y- You bitch!
Go ahead, kill me!
I'm a blind old woman. It's simple!
Like the way you killed Jhil.
Lord Jhil?!
What did she say?
Lord Jhil was ill!
Murderers!
Murderers!\NQuiet them!
Don't be easy on those who defy.
Everyone, wait!
Please listen to me.
I don't want any more deaths.
Please.
Princess.
Please understand as well, Grandmother.
Let's obey these people.
It's a pretty nice valley, don't you think?
I'm opposed to this.
Our orders are to transport the God Soldier\Nback home as soon as possible.
The order cannot be carried out.
Our largest ship couldn't bear the weight\Nof that thing; it crashed.
But...
You can't seriously want establish a state\Nhere?
And what if I am?
Are you saying we should make that monster\Nthe play-thing of those fools back home?
Well, I could understand that, but...
I am no more than a simple soldier.
I would be overstepping my authority in\Nsuch a decision.
Hmph! Fox.
I will return to Pejite.
In my absence, put all your efforts into\Nreviving the God Soldier.
Yes, ma'am!
Can we take this gunship?
Yes, spoils of war.
Don't mistake me.
I am not consulting you.
But, taking the Princess to Pejite...
Five hostages, the gunship, and food, you\Nsay?
I'll leave the selection of the hostages\Nup to you.
Complete preparations for departure by tomorrow\Nmorning.
Thanks for being the hostages.
Never mind us.
Look.
They intend to take everything.
I will leave this place for the time being.
I'll return secretly and wait for an opportunity.
We must stop the revival of that monster\Nat all costs.
Right.
Nausicaa?
Teto, where is your mistress?
Nausicaa.
What is the meaning of this?
These are plants from the Wasteland.
I gathered the spores and grew them.
It's all right.
They're not giving off any vapor.
Not giving off poison?!
Although the air in here is certainly pure.
Why?
Even this venomous Hisokusari plant has\Nflowered.
The water here is brought up from 500 meters\Nunderground...
...by the castle's giant windmill.
I gathered the sand from the bottom of the\Nsame well.
With clean water and soil...
I've found out that the Wasteland's plants\Ndon't emit poison.
It's the soil that's polluted.
Even the soil of this valley is polluted.
Why?
Who could have done this to the world?
You found that out all by yourself?
Yes.
I wanted to cure Father's and everyone's\Nillness.
But, I'll close this place soon.
I stopped the water a little while ago...
...so everything should soon wither away.
Nausicaa –
I- I'm afraid of myself.
I lost my temper and killed in spite.
I don't know what I will do.
I don't want to kill anyone else.
Princess!
We've gathered these Chico nuts.
We give them to you, Princess!
Everyone...
So many...
It must have been hard.
Thank you.
I'll eat them with care.
Poor Princess.
Hurry and get on board! We're leaving.
Come on, everyone. Don't cry any more.
It's OK. I'll come right back.
Really?
Hey, have I ever told you a lie?
No.
Have I?
No.
Really?
Yes.
Now go, it will be dangerous here.
Okay.
Promise!
Take care of the Princess!
Take care of the rest!
Are we in Pejite yet?
My hip is hurting.
My, my...
The Princess has chosen hostages that won't\Nbe missed.
Say, don't you think this is strange?
Why are we flying in a close swarm like\Nthis?
It's as if they're afraid of an attack.
Beneath the clouds is a terrible whirlpool\Nof vapors.
Don't move.
Gunship!
Enemy attack!
Ship number 2, destroyed!
Like I said!
How frightening!
Perimeter defense! It's a Pejite gunship!
Pejite?
Damn – ship number 3, destroyed as well!
What is the corvette doing?
We can't steer! We can't steer!
What a fragile ship.
The rear guard was caught up in it!
The barge's wire!
Teto, hurry!
It's no use, this one'll fall, too!
Princess!
STOP! Don't kill any more!
STOP!
Princess!
Hurry, Mito!
Princess – It's no use!
We might be able to fly it!
What?
Mito! Hurry!
Coming!
Engine, start!
We'll blast the door with the gun!
Right
Come on!
Quickly!
Quickly, get inside!
Mito, ready?
Somehow!
Engine full.
Same time as the gun blast!
Roger!
Ready!
FIRE!
Put on the masks!
We'll descend below the clouds and rescue\Nthe barge!
Still warm.
Please don't die, Teto!
What a world down there.
I've never seen such dense a vapor before.
Rear seat, watch to the right!
It's near.
It's still flying!
It's true!
It really is there!
Princess!\NIt's the Princess!
Everyone! Hang on!
I'll extend the tow rope.
The hook is broken.
Aerial retrieval is impossible!
I don't want to land and be eaten by the\Nbugs!
I'll just die without any more ado!
Calm down!
Throw out the baggage!
Fare thee well!
Do as I say!
Throw out the baggage!
Rear seat! Cut the engine!
What?
The engine noise is a hindrance. Hurry!
Okay!
P-Princess! W- What –
Princess, your mask!
You'll die!
Put on your mask!
Everybody! I'll save you for certain.
Trust me.
Throw out the baggage!
We'll do anything!
Just, please, put back your mask!
The Princess is smiling.
We're going to be saved.
Hurry! Throw out the baggage!
The bow is falling!
Ignite the engine!
We'll look for a place to land.
A little got in my lungs.
Princess!
Is everyone OK?
Don't move!
You –
Thanks for all your help.
Why save such a –\NPrincess!
You're far too trusting.
Did you think I would get on my knees and\Nthank you?
You don't understand anything about the\NWastelands.
This is not a human world.
You can't know what will happen if you use\Nthat gun in this place.
In the battle a little while ago...
...many ships fell into the forest.
The insects are angry.
Look, above.
The royal Yanma is the sentinel of the forest.
It will summon the other insects immediately.
We must escape at once!
Fetch the spare rope!
Yes!
Mito, repair the hook!
Yes!
Don't move!
I'll give the orders!
What are you frightened of?
You're like a little lost fox-squirrel.
What!
Don't be afraid.
I just want you to go back to your own country.
You –
They've come!
Don't anger them.\NQuiet!
This is an Ohmu's nest!
W- we're surrounded.
They're looking us over.
Ohmu!
I'm sorry!
Forgive us for disturbing your nest.
But, please understand!
We're not your enemies.
P- Princess!
That one is alive?
Wait!
Ohmu!
What's going on?
The Ohmu's eyes are bright red.
Princess –
What do you think you're doing with Mehve?
When the water calms down,
Take off at once and wait up in the air.
If I'm not back in one hour,
Return to the valley!
But –
Princess!
She's gone.
I'll take that.
Well, everyone,
Let's do as the Princess said.
Princess –
Damn!
You're –
You've killed too many!
Flares and insect-whistles won't calm them\Nanymore!
Quicksand!
Damn.
It's already been 2 hours!
The insects have only increased.
Princess!
Princess!
Nausicaa.
Nausicaa.
Come here.
Come here.
Father.
Mother's here, too.
No.
I don't want to go that way.
Stay away.
There's nothing here.
Really there's nothing.
Don't come out.
It's an Ohmu larva.
So the tree was infested, after all.
Give it here, Nausicaa.
No.
It hasn't done anything wrong.
People and insects can't live in the same\Nworld, child.
Please!
Don't kill it!!
Please –
Teto –
Such a mysterious place.
Hi!
I finally found it.
How do you feel?
Where are we?
First of all, let me thank you.
I'm Asbel of Pejite.
Thanks for saving me.
I'm Nausicaa, from the Valley of the Wind.
Where are we?
It's not surprising that you're amazed.
We're beneath the Wasteland.
Beneath the Wasteland?
Look.
We fell down from up there, with the sands.
We don't have our masks on.
Yes, that's just it.
The air here is clean.
I was surprised, too.
Imagine finding a place like this under\Nthe Wastelands.
What's the matter?
Nausicaa, don't go too far.
What a magnificent tree.
It's still conducting water, even though\Nit has died.
Just like the sand from the well.
The trees die and fossilize, then crumble\Ninto sand.
Nausicaa –
You're crying?
Yes. I'm happy.
Rastel was my twin sister.
I wanted to be there for her.
I should have told you sooner.\NI'm sorry.
No.
I'm sorry.
I almost killed the person who saw her die.
No.
So...
That thing is now in the Valley of the Wind?
Strange tasting nuts, aren't they?
They're called Chico nuts. They're very\Nnutritious.
Despite the taste, I could eat a boot full.
The reason for the birth of Wastelands?
You think about strange things.
The trees of the Wastelands were born to\Nclean this world that humans polluted.
They take the earth's poison into themselves...
...purify it into clean crystals, then die\Nand become pure sands.
This underground cavern was created in that\Nway.
And, the insects are protecting that forest.
If so, it seems we'd have no choice but\Nto die out.
We don't know how many thousands of years\Nit will take
We can't keep living in fear of the poisons\Nand the insects.
At the very least,
We need a way to keep the Wasteland from\Nspreading any further.
You sound just like Kushana.
No! We aren't planning to use the God Soldier\Nin warfare!
Tomorrow, when you meet everyone, you'll\Nunderstand!
Let's go to sleep.
Tomorrow, we have to fly a long way.
All's well, Sir.
Going smoothly?
Yes, sir!
The upper-half has almost stabilized.
Really, the more I look, the cuter you seem.
Even for a poor soldier like myself, long-dormant\Nambitions start to ache.
It's laughing!
The likes of you should've slept underground\N'til the end of time!
Chief!
Her Highness's convoy was attacked by a\NPejite.
The entire fleet has been annihilated...
...leaving only one corvette.
What happened to Her Highness!
Her ship exploded in mid-air, I'm told.
Chief!
The villagers don't know yet?
No, sir!
Good! I'll go at once.
As for the rest of you, continue the operation!
Yes, sir!
Is this a stroke of luck for this poor soldier...
...or is it just a snare of destruction?
Uncle Mito and the others have come back.
They're waiting for you at the Acid Sea,\NMaster Yupa.
We're ashamed to have returned alone.
No, I'm glad you're safe.
You're setting me free?
If you sink the God Soldier deep into the\NAcid Sea...
...and return to your own country.
You have few soldiers remaining in the valley.
It would be easy to fight you now...
...but there's no sense in causing any more\Ncasualties.
Neither fire nor acid will harm that thing.
Nor can you move it now, until it walks\Nitself.
Don't you understand? There's no turning\Nback.
It was out of fear that a another country\Nmight possess such enormous power...
I was ordered to conquer Pejite.
Now that its location is known, your neighbors\Nwill soon send huge armies.
There's only one path left to you.
Revive the God Soldier!
Repulse all intervention, and live with\Nthat thing!
Look!
By an insect?
He who marries me will see yet more dreadful\Nthings.
Burn the Wastelands!
Kill the insects!
Why do you hesitate to take back the world\Nfor mankind?!
Take that thing, as we took it from Pejite.
We will never revive the God Soldier.
Emergency!\NHey, give the password!
I'm in a hurry!
Wind!
VALLEY!
Pass.
A spore was left!
WHAT!
They're giving off great vapors.
It's making a huge commotion thru the valley!
Hand them over!
Hurry, hand them over!
That's right!
If we don't hurry...
...the whole valley will be consumed!
Return the hand-hooks and flame-throwers!
It's growing rapidly!
The tools for burning spores could be used\Nas weapons.
Giving them those would –
It can't be helped.
Return everything except the guns.
Yes, sir!
The corvette is departing.
Don't fail this time.
Gather the remaining troops from Pejite.
Bring them to this valley.
Yes, sir!
Geez. This is becoming troublesome.
Hurry up!
Please find the Princess.
Take care of the valley.
Restrain yourselves until I return.
We will.
We'll go to the valley.
It's no use! The spore has spread this far.
It struck here, too!
Out of the way!
What are you doing!
Here, too.
Grandmother –
We can only burn them.
This forest is lost.
If we hesitate, the whole valley will be\Nswallowed up.
Isn't there anything that can be done?
This forest has protected the reservoir\Nfor 300 years.
Damn.
If only they hadn't come.
It looks like it won't end with just this.
Let's go.
You think so?
It looks the same as always to me.
No insects.
I wonder why?
My heart is pounding.
It's a little further.
After we cross those mountains, my people\Nare there.
It looks strange towards Pejite.
What's that haze?
Asbel, put on your mask!
Insects? All dead?
We're going to Pejite!
Be careful!
Torumekian troops should be there.
Even an Ohmu.
Even the Center Dome was breached.
It's the end of Pejite.
Even if we annihilated the Torumekians,\Nthis is –
Annihilated?
What do you mean, Asbel?
It's a brig.
It's my people's ship!
It's coming down. Let's go!
Asbel! You're alive!
What have you done?
We can't even rebuild from this!
You saw the city, I see.
Don't worry.
Even if it's swallowed by the Wasteland,\Nwe can burn it away almost at once.
But the God Soldier isn't here.
I know.
It's in the Valley of the Wind.
How did you know?
We weren't playing, either.
We've already put phase 2 into action.
By tonight, the Torumekian army in the Valley\Nof the Wind will be destroyed.
What!
Destroyed?
What are you going to do?
Asbel, who is this?
Nausicaa, from the Valley of the Wind.
She saved my life.
The Valley of the Wind?
Tell me! What's happening?
Asbel, you know, don't you?
Tell me.
We will drive the insects to attack.
You were the one who made the insects attack\NPejite?
How could you?
We must take back the God Soldier at any\Ncost.
It's to protect the world.
Please understand.
So you'll kill the people of the valley\Nin the process?
Stop it!
Stop it at once!
Please –
It's too late.
No one can stop them once they've started\Nto run.
Most of us were killed by the Torumekians.
There's no other way left for us.
Hold her!
Release me!
Let me go!
Even though it's hard right now...
...as soon as we take back the God Soldier...
...we can burn the Wastelands and take back\Nthe world.
You're the same as the Torumekians!\NThat's a lie!
No!
They would only use it for destruction!
You drink the well-water, too, don't you?
Who do you think is purifying that water?
The lakes and rivers that humans have made\Ninto poisoned waters...
...the trees of Wastelands are purifying\Nagain.
You're saying you'll burn down those forests?
It's your fault for excavating the God Soldier!
Then, what should we do? Just do as the\NTorumekians dictate?
No! No!
Asbel, tell them the reason why the Wasteland\Nwas born!
Tell them the insects are protecting the\Nworld!
Asbel, please.
What are you doing?
Don't move!
Let her go.
Calm down, Asbel.
I'm serious!
Let her go!
Nausicaa! Warn everyone –
Asbel!
Release me!
Those fools.
We can't help what's already started.
But, we were told to restrain ourselves.
Don't panic.
Go rescue the soldiers with tanks!
Chief!\NYes, Sir!
The last one went down.
Are they coming this way?
I don't know.
The villagers are gathering.
Don't you hate it? A forest or two, and\Nthey go blood-thirsty.
It's Pejite all over again.
Take this!
They've taken the tank.
Hurry, get it moving!
Don't rush me.
They're coming!
Forward!
Come on, come on, hurry up.
I wonder if this is it?
It moved!
Which way are you going?
Go forward! Forward!
I know!
Damn! Send out all the tanks!
She's alive.
It was but a brief dream.
Your Highness!
While we hold them here, take everyone to\Nshelter by the Acid Sea!
Understood.
Hold on until the Princess returns with\Nthe gunship!
Everybody, hurry.
Hurry up.
Don't be so slow. Why don't you help too?
I have a bad back.
They've come! The tanks have come!
Hurry!
I know, already!
There's no mistake?
It's a Pejite brig.
I caught a glimpse of it beyond those clouds.
Good!
Please be careful.
She was acting violently only a little while\Nago.
Hurry.
Miss Nausicaa,
We'll get you out of here.
Go and warn the Valley.
There may still be time if you use your\Nkite.
It's all been prepared.
Asbel told us everything.
I'll take your place.
Hurry and put this on.
Who are you?
I'm Rastel's mother.
Mother...
I'm so sorry.
What we did was all wrong.
Hurry.
That girl?
She'll be all right; don't worry.
Be careful.
Please forgive the terrible treatment.
Nausicaa, over here! Hurry!
OK.
Hurry.
Thank you, everyone!
Sorry I was late.
Can you fly from here?
I'll try.
A corvette!
Retreat! Hurry, into the clouds!
Cease fire!
Fools!
It's a turbulent, electric hell in those\Nclouds.
It's no use! We can't steer!
The ship is breaking up!
Everyone! It can't be helped.
Let's get out of the clouds and fight.
They anticipated us!
Damn. What do they intending to do?
The clouds! They're going to force us onto\Nthe clouds and board!
They're coming!
If you're going to fly, now is the only\Ntime.
I can't do that! I'll stay behind, too!
I can't just leave that girl or your mother\Nbehind and go!
Only you can save the people of the Valley!
Please, go!
Go for us!
We'll take the ship.
Don't take prisoners.
Kill them all.
Go Nausicaa. GO!
Asbel!
Princess!
Mito!
Mito! Master Yupa!
Princess!
Hurry!
Everyone –
Everyone will –
I'll extend the retrieval hook now!
Master Yupa! The red lever on the right!
This is the last place left.
Hurry!
The door – it's breaking!
Let them come.
We'll show them the pride of Pejite!
What's that?
A bird?
It's a ship!\NA gunship from the Valley of the Wind!
What?
Bastard!
It's Yupa!\NKill him and you'll be famous!
Surrender! The corvette will not be returning.
OK
Princess, this is ridiculous!
The engine will explode!
As long as it lasts to the Valley.
Raise it to 300.
Dear God... God of the Wind...
Please protect everyone.
It doesn't seem like we can budge them,\Neven with a lever.
They're waiting for her return.
Return?
They expect that girl to return with the\Ngunship.
The gunship would be troublesome.
Shall we start a fight now, before it returns?
Do you know what that ship is?
It was built before the Seven Days of Fire.
It supposedly went as far as the stars.
The guns don't work well against it because\Nit's extremely hard.
But, if we aim at the holes –
I want to wait as well.
To see if she can indeed return from the\Ndepth of the Wastelands alive.
I would have liked to have spoken with that\Ngirl once.
Well?
Made up your minds?
If you're going to counsel surrender, I'll\Nrelease you.
Do you want this to be a repetition of Pejite?
You're a Princess, too...
But you're very different from our Princess.
Look at this hand.
It's the same disease as Lord Jhil's.
In half a year, it'll be just like a rock.
But, our Princess says she likes this hand.
She told me it was the beautiful hand of\Na hard-working person.
Even so affected by the poisons, you say\Nyou will live with the Wasteland?
You use fire. We use a little of that, too,\Nbut...
Too much fire gives birth to nothing.
Fire turns a forest to ash in one day.
Water and wind take a hundred years to nurture\Na forest.
We prefer water and wind.
When the Princess sees that forest, she\Nwill grieve.
Chief. Any orders yet?
Get back down.
Yes Sir.
I don't know why, but you've turned soft-hearted.
Kurotowa! Release those people!
Yes, ma'am.
Then we're going to wait?
Let the troops take their meal!
In one hour we'll begin the attack!
A meal, eh?
I guess I'll take my time with it.
Somebody's coming!
It's Goll and the others!
What's the matter?
There's no wind.
No wind?
You're right, The wind has stopped.
Grandmother, what's the matter?
Grandmother?
Somebody... Somebody help me outside!
This is the first time the wind ever stopped.
Grandmother, my ears hurt.
The atmosphere...
The atmosphere is filled with anger.
Close.
We've passed over the Wasteland!
Three minutes to the Acid Sea!
Engine, slow!
We'll descend beneath the clouds.
What are those lights?
Ohmu!
The Ohmu have flooded out of the Wastelands!
They're heading for the Valley of the Wind!
How did they get the Ohmu to stampede?\NWhy?
Someone is calling the herd.
Mito! Fly towards that star!
Right.
There.
Mito, a flare!
Ready!
FIRE!
What's that?
How cruel.
They're using that child as a lure to call\Nthe herd.
Damn!! I'll shoot them down!
NO!
Don't shoot!
Mito, please!
Why! Why can't I shoot them down?
If we kill the Ohmu's child, we won't be\Nable to stop the stampede!
Then what can we do?
The Valley's going to be annihilated!
Calm down, Mito!
We'll return the Ohmu's child to the herd.
I'll try it.
Princess, what are you doing?
Mito, you go warn everyone!
Princess –
You don't even have a weapon!
Those are not our flares!
Distance?\NAbout 20 leagues.
I think that it's on the other side of the\Nlake.
Do you think it's the gunship?
Most likely.
It's a signal requesting help.
It's definitely the gun ship.
One hour has passed.
Let's go.\NYou won't wait?
I've chosen the bloody path, after all.
Armored troops, forward!
Won't you go inside?
Here is fine.
The gunship!
Air raid!
Cease fire!
Stop. Stop it!
Princess –
Await orders here!
Hold your fire!
Your Highness!
What happened to that girl?
Where's the Princess?
She's not riding in the back!
It's the Ohmu!
A herd of Ohmu is coming this way!
What?
Ohmu?
The Princess stayed behind alone to stop\Nthe stampede.
There's no time for fighting!
Everyone, escape to high ground!
Hurry!
Grandmother, I can see red lights!
It looks like they're growing rapidly.
They're coming this way!
Hang on tight to Grandma.
No one can stop them now.
Don't panic!
It's still all right!
Mito, I'm going to die anyway.
I'll die in the valley.
No.
If the Princess hasn't given up, you can't\Ngive up.
All right?
Gain as much time as you can.
I will return shortly.
Your Highness! Are you considering that\Nthing...?
It's too soon.
If not now, when?
Go!
Don't shoot! Listen to me!
Damn – That one's like a bird!
That person's not an enemy.
She was crying out something.
Anyone who hinders the plan is an enemy.
If we don't drop the lure in the valley\Nsoon, we'll be the one's in danger.
She's coming.
Draw her in really close before you fire.
Now! Shoot!
No!
That's Rastel –
Move!
Don't be angry.
Don't be frightened.
I'm not your enemy.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I can't ask you to forgive us, can I?
It was too cruel, wasn't it?
You mustn't move!
You'll cause more bleeding!
Be a good boy, don't move.
Oh no!\NThey found us.
They're coming this way!
Don't!\NIf you go in with a wound like that –!
This lake water is no good, I tell you!
You –
Kind child.
I'm all right.
Soon everyone will be here to take you back.
They're turning.
They're not coming this way!
Ohmu!
Don't!
The Valley of the Wind lies that way!
In anger they've forgotten themselves.
If I can't calm them, the Valley will be\N–!
The fools!
They're baiting the Ohmu themselves!
We're saved.
Let's take off at once.
Check the engine.
S- Stop!
We can explain!
Carry us.
I'll return that child to the herd!
It's no use.
The herd won't stop!
You'll only have to drop us in front of\Nthe herd.
Carry us!
But – You'll die, too!
Grandmother, will everyone die?
If that is our destiny.
We can only obey.
Haven't budged at all!
Let's retreat, sir.
Idiot.
Where would we escape to?
Hey!
Don't run away!
Wait!
Hey!
Stand your ground until Her Highness returns!
Her Highness.
Her Highness!
It's decomposing.
It was too early.
Burn them down!
What's the matter?
Are you not descended of the most evil power\Non earth?
Amazing.
No wonder the world was burned!
Her Highness Kushana.
Hooray!
Burn them down!
What's the matter, monster?
Fire at once!
The God Soldier died.
It's better that way.
The anger of the Ohmu is the anger of the\Nearth.
Of what use is surviving, relying on a thing\Nlike that?
Princess!
It's the Princess!
A place like that?
That's crazy.
Princess!
The Ohmu's attack color is going out.
The anger has disappeared from the atmosphere.
They've stopped.
The Ohmu have stopped.
Princess!
The Princess is dead.
She has quieted the Ohmu's anger with her\Nown life.
That child has protected the Valley.
Look!
W- What are these lights?
Teto.
I'm glad.
Ohmu, thank you.
Thank you.
It's a miracle.
It's a miracle.
What sympathy they possess.
The Ohmu are opening their hearts.
Children, look in place of my blind eyes.
The Princess is wearing a dark blue foreign\Ndress.
It's as if she's walking through a golden\Nlight.
"That one, wearing robes of blue, shall\Ndescend onto a golden field..."
Grandmother?
The old legend has indeed come true.
Look!
It's Mehve!
The wind! The wind is back!
