Subject: Documentation
of inventions by Sid Lidz...
random samples, 1951-1962.
Test Number 75.
July 5, 1951.
Note: Bottle showed
excellent resistance...
to percussive impact from
1.1 kilogram stone. That's me talking.
Subject was next given bottle
to receive delivery of fluids. However...
My dad's an inventor by trade.
He believes in the purity
and power of science.
He would say there was nothing broken
that science couldn't fix.
Like the time he spent
an entire weekend...
making me a flying
purple people eater costume
without eye holes...
because he insisted
flying purple people eaters...
would have sensory antenna,
and not eyes.
...tested by Steven Lidz,
age seven.
Note: Subject was initially
pleased with the appearance
and performance of costume.
However, a minor slippage of mirror
within periscopic antenna...
obscured subject's
peripheral vision, resulting
in non-injury accident.
Thanks to Mom,
future development of
this prototype was abandoned.
Test Number 211, May 8, 1958.
Perpetual motion baby jumper.
Subject: Sandy Lidz,
age 22 months.
My dad believes
in documentation...
and recording the details
and progress of our lives.
...resulted in
seizure of right fly wheel.
Subject was uninjured.
Test Number 175.
May 15, 1957.
Mild monsoon sprinkler system.
Subject: Selma's rose garden
Note: Slow motion
macrophotography..
reveals even distribution
of droplets from watering heads.
Timed diurnal cycles should
produce significant increase
in plant growth.
Invention performed
according to specifications.
The gardener...
Even accidents
are important to document...
like when Mom got too close
to Dad's sprinkler system...
and Dad said he had recorded
a serendipitous phenomenon:
the similarity between
two American beauties...
- the red rose...
and my mom, Selma Lidz.
Test Number 319. May 5, 1962.
Domedary...
Dad said science
was the only heroic path.
Of course,
his brothers didn't agree.
Uncle Danny and Uncle Arthur
had their own paths.
But it annoyed Dad too much
to talk about them.
It was Mom who told me
a hero is anybody who finds
his own way through this life.
She told me this would be
the year I'd find mine.
Someday I'll invent a camera
that'll last more than 30 seconds.
Are your eyes closed?
Okay. Happy birthday, honey.
Okay, here we go.
Happy birthday.
A tent?
Now' the entire operation
is controlled by this remote...
which includes a surprise feature
which we'll discuss in a moment.
- But before surprise comes what?
- I have no idea.
Safety! In the event the remote
doesn't work which it will...
and you're trapped inside
and there's an emergency...
and you need
to evacuate immediately...
you can do so manually
through this entrance way all right?
Come over here.
Sit on the bed.
Selma... watch this!
- I thought I was getting
a Kodak Instamatic 500.
- Yeah, an Instamatic 500.
- Your dad had a brainstorm.
- I want to show you
the surprise feature.
- Go over to your dad.
- Do I have to?
Come on' Steven.
Come over here quick,
quick, quick! Come on in.
Watch!
Now, sit on the bed.
Hold on. Okay.
Ready?
Damn it! Why isn't
this thing working?
Get the light projector.
- The what?
- The light projector!
Right here. Come on, grab it.
That's it. Come on.
Just give it... Give it
a hard tap underneath.
Oh! Oh!
- Oh, damn. Sid.
- That's it. I blew
the whole house out.
Steven, begin
emergency evacuation.
# The other night #
# As I lay sleepin' #
# Ooh, I dreamed
I held you #
# Held you in my arms #
# Oh, but when I awoke
this mornin' #
# Found out I was mistaken #
# Do you know that
I hung my head #
# Hung my head and cried #
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
# You told me once, yeah
that you really loved me #
- # Don't eat the strawberries #
- # I want the strawberries
it's my birthday#
Whoo!
- Whoo!
- # Could ever come between #
Whoo! Yeah!
- # You left me # Whoo!
- # You left me #
- Hey, first batch, Sid!
- Dad, pancakes!
- # You have shattered #
- Steven, get the record.
It's gonna skip.
- # You are my sunshine #
- Excuse me. That should do it.
You know what Spinoza says:
The only graceful form
is that of the circle.
- Then again, he never met you.
Steven, turn out the lights.
All right,
here we go!
Blast off.
Ha-ha!
- There's Saturn.
- Yeah, there's Saturn.
See? look on the
frigidaire over there.
Wow!
Look at that shooting star.
It's kinda neat.
Look at all those!
Ooh, look at
the wishing star up there!
Oh, yeah.
- How was your day?
- It was pretty good. How was yours?
Yeah.
- Look, there's Venus.
- Where?
Right over there.
Daddy, how many stars
are there, anyways?
That's a stellar question.
But to be able to answer that...
- you have to know the highest number.
- What is the highest number?
Well, since time and space
are unbounded...
everything starts
with nothing.
Naturally, nothing begins
and nothing ends...
and nothing can be
created out of nothing.
As Socrates says,
"As for me, all I know
is that I'm nothing."
- Sid, just answer the question.
- I'm getting to it. First I'll
need to explain basic algebra.
Let's define the limit
that a function "F" approaches
at "X" equals "A"...
- Sid.
- Dad.
Infinity.
I know you're
disappointed, but we'll get you
a camera next year, kiddo.
You have to admit,
you're the only kid on the block
with one of these.
Mom, is Dad
from another planet?
- Who told you that?
- The kids say it at school.
Oh! Well...
he could be.
Although if I were
from another planet...
I don't think
I'd choose Roseman Avenue
as my place to land.
Does it bother you
what they say?
Well, yeah.
I mean...
Listen,
you are getting older.
And it's probably time
that you know.
What?
- Your dad...
- Yeah?
- Your dad's a genius.
- A genius?
And most people
don't understand that.
So... you shouldn't care if
they laugh or say mean things,
you know?
- You should just be proud of him
like he's proud of you.
- He is?
Oh, God,
of course he is!
Give me a hug.
Good night, birthday boy. Mmm.
Sweet dreams.
Okay, let's see if this thing
really works.
- Wait. Hey, Mom?
- Yeah, what, baby?
Mom, remember when I told you
I was thinking of running
for class president?
- Sure I do!
-Well, I don't think I will now.
Why not? Gosh,
I thought that was
such a terrific idea.
- No one's gonna vote for me.
- Gosh, how do you know until
you give yourself a chance?
- You know, I mean,
we can make posters...
- No.
- And your dad, your dad
could write speeches.
- No, wait, what if I lose?
- I mean, I'll be humiliated?
- So what if you lose?
Who cares? Big deal.
Look at Adlai Stevenson.
He ran for president twice,
and he didn't win.
- Do you think he was embarrassed?
- Yes.
Oh. Well...
Look, kiddo, I'm sure
you'll work it out.
- Your hands smell good.
- Oh, thanks.
It's a new lotion I used.
It's Avon.
It's a little more expensive
but what the hell?
Live dangerously, right?
- I have pretty hands, don't you think?
- Yeah.
- Do I have your hands?
- I don't know. Let me see.
Hmm.
You know,
I think you do.
Mmm.
Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Mom.
- Happy birthday.
Now the first thing
we have to do is make two lists.
One list you call
"possible ideas."
The other list,
"available materials."
Let's go!
For instance.
Possible ideas
for your election speech:
let's say,
benefits of integrating schools.
Available materials:
School buses
the national guard.
Number two. How about
winning the space race?
Possible idea:
School science olympics.
Now, available materials.
What would they be?
They would be what?
The NASA surplus electronics,
recycled jet parts...
- I don't know, Dad.
- What? What? Now, get...
Hey! What are you doing
with those? Stop playing.
It's not a toy.
No one at school
cares about that stuff.
What kid isn't interested
in space exploration?
- Well... none of them.
- I don't believe that.
What about
the Venus Mariner?
They're launching next fall.
It's going to take pictures
of a planet millions
of miles away.
It takes my breath away.
It's unbelievable
what great minds can do.
Steven, my papers!
Steven
- Steven, now come on.
- I'm sorry.
You know you're not supposed
to do that, Steven!
Steven,
you have no idea...
what an extraordinary time
you're living in.
- When I was your age, I went
to see the 1939 World's Fair.
- The 1939 World's Fair.
I told you the story.
All right. But it changed
the way I saw things.
It affected my entire life.
I saw the future,
a technotopian future.
There were these dioramas
of these gigantic buildings,
I don't know, 500 stories.
And all these monorails
that... vroom!
That ran around
200 miles an hour,
they transported people.
The frontiers of science
and medicine predicted
an end to all disease.
And how a man's life span
will soon be 100 years.
That's why I said everything
can always be broken down
into numbers.
I tell you that science,
pure science, will be earth's
ultimate salvation, right?
And all because of what
we can think of with this.
What's going on
down there?
- I... oh!
- Selma?
- Oh, God, Sid.
- Selma?
- I don't know what happened. I was...
- Okay, hold on to me.
- I was nauseous
and the room started spinning.
- Can you get up?
Steven, run downstairs
open the phone book to "F."
Look for Dr. Feldman's number.
Are you okay?
Call him quickly!
Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Can you focus?
- I'm just sick.
- Your hands feel cold.
Let me take your pulse.
Stop it!
Stop it!
What the...
- Daddy, Daddy?
- What?
This is no fun.
When's Mommy gonna wake up?
Soon, honey.
She needs sleep to get better.
Wait, we're not gonna
leave her here, are we?
No, she has to stay
for a little while.
She has to take some tests.
- We'll come back tomorrow.
- What's wrong with her?
She has a very bad cold,
okay? Now go.
- You guys go on. I'll be
right with you, okay?
- All right.
Hold the microphone higher.
The point is to have
the sound precisely
synchronized to the image.
Hi, Mark. Hi, Shirley.
Why don't you help me test it
by asking some questions?
All right, hey!
Hi!
Hi!
- You look 100% better.
- At least.
- 200%. Eat.
- A latke with some nice applesauce.
- Or maybe some applesauce?
A small dish.
- Well...
- I'll put it in a dessert bowl.
-Joanie, she doesn't want it.
What difference does it make?
Sandy, hurry up.
Uncle Melvin wants
to ask you a question.
Sandy, come on over here.
Come and give Uncle Melvin
a nice sweet kiss.
Sandy, tell Uncle Melvin
what's the highest number.
- Eleven?
- No. Remember,
Daddy told you the
highest number, I taught you?
- I don't know. Can I go get my dolly?
- Go right ahead.
- Bright kid you got there, Sidney.
- Yeah? What's the highest number?
Six thousand. You want
to know why? That's
what in my bank account.
Are you really
taking this with real sound
or synchronized sound?
- Yes. That's the way you do it.
- Hey, Dad?
It's Uncle Arthur.
Arthur.
Hi, Arthur. Hi.
How're you doin'?
- Oh, good. Hello, Sidney.
- Hi. Nice to see you.
Oh, good. I brought
something for you.
Oh, yeah?
Great.
- What is it?
- It's a series of leaves.
- Oh, with a stick through them, yeah.
- Yeah. To old 'em together.
Thanks.
Where's Danny?
- Hey, Danny.
What's goin' on?
-We were followed.
Arthur can vouch for this.
Two men in gray overcoats
and hats are on our tail.
But we were too quick
for them.
I specifically chose
a more difficult bus route
going in the opposite direction.
Then we got off near
Hancock Park. Shook 'em.
Oh, I'm sure everyone in
this room has been monitored!
Someone might even be bugged!
- Oh, if you can hear me,
just know that I'm on to you.
- Oh! Stop, please.
Oh, my God, Selma.
You look like death!
You have absolutely no color.
It's frightening.
Why don't you go
and get some air...
instead of sitting inside
with these phony,
miserable bastards?
- Sid!
- Danny!
- What is it with this schmuck
all the time?
- I heard that.
- Good!
- N-N-N-N-N-Now, let's not have a scene.
We're here for a nice visit.
So why don't we just have
a nice visit?
- Arthur, a latke.
- Oh, thank you.
Look, be careful!
She probably fried 'em
in hemlock.
Arthur...
did anybody ever tell you
you have a crackpot putz
for a brother?
- No.
-You are an unmarried
slave trader.
I work for a modeling
agency, you maniac.
And I happen to be seeing
someone at the moment.
Yes, an Eisenhower Nazi!
- Uh-oh.
- Eisenhower was one
of our finest presidents!
Here we go.
The man was a Jew-hater!
"I like Ike."
A secret gentile code
for "I hate kikes."
- Anyone with half a brain
would know that.
- That leaves you out.
I hardly think you should be
smoking a marijuana cigarette
in your condition.
- Marijuana? What?
- What? I am not!
- Oh, you don't think I know
slurred speech when I hear it?
- Oh, shoot!
Let's see now.
"Danny's coming over.
I need marijuana."
No, I thought, "Danny's
comin' over. I need a gun!"
Sid, could you put your camera
down and please come with me?
- Danny, do me a favor.
Please stop being so abrasive.
- Now, now, now, now...
let's not forget
we're a family,
for better or for worse.
In any family,
there are problems,
there are disagreements.
There are good people...
and there are demented schmucks
who are not welcome!
- You're a pox on the Jewish race.
- You are a pox period!
- I can't believe you called me a pox.
- Ohh!
Everybody, calm down. I'll start
the coffee. I'll get the cups
and cake and start the coffee.
Ioanie, why do
you have to say everything
six different ways?
You wanna make coffee,
go make coffee!
Say it once!
- Make the damn come!
- Stop yelling at her, Mel.
I found something for you.
- What is it?
- It's a special remedy
to get rid of your itching.
- You just rub it right on the area.
- I don't have any itching, Arthur.
Danny had mentioned
that something
was irritating you.
Something is irritating me.
If I rub it in Danny,
will he go away?
I'm not sure. Uh, eh...
you'd have to read the label
under "other uses."
It's very thoughtful, Arthur.
Thank you.
Could I have
the wrapping back?
"And when confronting problems
any class leader must face...
"I promise to show
the resilience of Adlai Stevenson...
who refused to take no
for an answer... twice."
Okay, this is
the conclusion.
Okay?
"And I pledge to do
my utmost to represent...
the interests of my fellow
classmates during these
dark and troubled times."
- What troubled times?
- Well, you know.
The Cold War.
The possibility of
a nuclear doomsday.
Don't you think, maybe,
you should lighten it up
just a little bit?
Oh, well, yeah.
Well, here, I have a joke,
okay?
Just tell me if you think
this is funny.
I think it is, really.
Okay, "In addition,
I hope to change cafeteria
restrictions...
thereby enforcing
every student's right
to due process of slaw!"
That's good!
You know, if you lose
the election, we could book you
on the Ed Sullivan Show.
Yeah, well, I-I better go,
'cause, you know,
I gotta get there.
Remember 2:00.
You should get there
by 1:30 for a good seat.
What's happening at 2:00?
Sid, my doctor's appointment's
not 'til 4:00, so I thought
maybe if I'm feeling better...
- Absolutely not.
It's out of the question.
- What?
Steven, your mother
has a doctor's appointment.
We don't want her overdoing it.
She's still very much
under the weather.
She's been resting for weeks!
You have to come.
- Oh, Sid.
- No.
- What about me?
You're the ones who told me
to do this, and now you're
not showing up. Just great.
And if there is one thing
that I learned from
Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy...
it's that
in spite of all the glamour
of running for office...
it is not
a popularity contest.
Which is why it doesn't bother
me when people say...
"But, Nancy Oppenheim
your initials are N.O."
Because I say Y.E.S.!
As you can tell,
I will represent...
this seventh grade class
to the best of my abilities...
and to honor our fine tradition
by insuring...
all of Herbert Hoover
junior high rules are enforced,
and enforced fairly.
Go H.H.J.H.!
I'd like to thank Nancy.
That was a well-written speech...
and well-executed.
And our next speaker
is Steven Lidz.
Are you all right?
Yeah... I'm fine.
Hello. My name is Steven Lidz.
- Um... many of you
don't know me very well.
I don't blame you
if you don't vote for me.
Thank you.
Thank you, Steven.
That was... concise,
and humble.
Right from the heart.
And our last speaker
is Ralph Crispi.
Yeah!
Thank you, Mrs. Kantruitz.
Now, I'm not just going
to stand here and make a
lot of promises like Nancy...
or let you off the hook
like Steven.
By the way, thanks, Steven.
- I'm just going to explain
why I'm the best choice.
- Excuse me.
Our class needs a strong,
powerful leader to ask...
not... what we can do
for Herbert Hoover...
but what Herbert Hoover can do for us!
You'll need someone
available and prepared
24 hours a day.
Not someone who's taking
time out for a cigarette
in the bathroom...
or someone you can't
even understand when he talks.
You'll need someone
who's there looking after
your best interests.
- We need...
- fascist smear monger!
- Who said that?
- I did!
And I think that boy
is a Hitler-in-the-making.
- That's my son
you're talking about.
- Meet Hitler's father.
Who the hell is this nut?
And what is he doing
in this school?
Gentlemen, please.
This assembly
is for the students.
And it is their participation
we are seeking in this
democratic process.
How can you let some
snot-nosed, spoiled brat
like that get up there...
and soil the minds of
these children with slanderous
and humiliating insinuations?
- Where are the issues?
- This is outrageous!
- The issues?
- I demand the
immediate withdrawal...
of this junior Joe McCarthy's
name from the nominating ballot.
And I further demand
an immediate roll call for
a new ballot to be implemented.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman!
- Mom!
- Yes, baby?
- Hey, Mom?
- What, sweet?
Mom, did you know that Idaho
means Jew-hater in Cherokee?
- Who told you that?
- Uncle Danny.
He also says that there are
only eight trustworthy people
in the entire world.
There used to be 12,
but four got assassinated.
If I die, Danny, I swear
I'm taking you with me.
Hey, Mom, he also said that
he has 27 bona fide sources...
but he can't reveal who they are
because he took an oath.
Who took an oath?
What are you saying?
- Uncle Danny.
- Danny? You saw Danny today?
- Yeah, you brought him
to the assembly, remember?
- Oh, right.
Dad, you shoulda seen what
he did to Ralph. He called
him a fascist smear monger...
- And a Hitler in the making.
- Here, honey. It says it
should be ingested with food...
but I think if I pulverized
two tablets and dissolve them
into a low pH liquid...
it'll enter your bloodstream
more rapidly.
Selma, are you all right?
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
- Wh-Why don't I go get
some Chinese tonight?
- No, I can make something else.
- Maybe we're pushing.
- Okay? No, no.
I just got a little dizzy.
- I've been laying down too damn much!
- I thought we decided about this.
- What the hell difference does it make?
- What do you mean, what difference?
- Didn't you read about
the dangers of cigarettes?
- Yes. I read the article...
- and I rolled it up and I smoked it.
- Selma, I swear to God.
-Just leave me alone.
- Mom, what's going on?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
Okay, let's go.
We're going out
to get some egg fooyung.
- I hate egg fooyung.
- I hate eggs.
Yeah, that's great.
We'll be back in five minutes.
Ten.
- But I don't like eggs.
- Oh, don't say that.
- We made them special.
We love eggs!
- Who's we?
They're good for us.
Builds muscle.
I can't eat them.
They look like snot.
Especially the left one.
Good morning, Mr. Lidz.
We're just throwing away
your daughter's breakfast.
She says it looks
like something
that came out of her nose.
- Who's we?
Daddy, do I have to eat these?
Dr. Feldman, hello, hello.
Thanks for calling back.
Who's she?
I'm sorry to bother you
again, but I was just
reading an article...
in the recent
Harvard Medical Journal
regarding blood testing...
for capsular sarcoma,
and it says...
Well, let me
just tell you.
Well, you might have missed
this article, hmm?
It says that 3%
of diagnosed ovarian cancers
can be benign...
- if the patient has a history of...
- Dad?
- Who's that lady?
- I know.
I know. Yes, I know hers
is not capsular...
but don't you think
it's worth checking,
just in case?
- Why not?
- Dad, who's that lady?
- Dad?
-Why the hell not?
Labs can make mistakes!
Dad?
Dr. Feldman, do not
talk to me like I'm
one of your patients.
I happen to be in the
business of experimentation...
and I damn well know
that not every test result
is exactly...
I'm not yelling!
I am not yelling!
I am... Hold on, hold on.
Steven, where're you going?
- T-To see Mom.
- No.
- You leave her alone.
She's resting.
- But...
I don't think a suggestion
to reevaluate the situation
is inappropriate.
- Well, perhaps another doctor
might feel differently.
- Dad? But, Dad...
Who's that lady in the kitchen?
Oh, that's Amelia.
She's gonna be taking care
of things around the house
until your mother feels better.
And I want you to stay out
of your mom's room.
She doesn't need you kids...
- bothering her all day
with every little problem.
- I'm not bothering her.
Stop it. Stop it!
She's vacuuming.
No, no, wait.
She stopped.
She's picking up something.
Okay, it's something shiny.
She put it in her pocket.
I think it's a quarter.
She found it, and she took it.
She found the quarter
and she took it.
Wait, she took it.
She, she's stealing.
I don't believe it!
That was my quarter when
I came home sick from school
and didn't use my milk money.
And sat down
and watched television,
and it fell outta my pocket.
- Quiet, she's gonna hear you.
- I was too sick to pick it up,
and then I forgot about it.
- We have to tell Dad.
- No, no, no.
- We have to!
- No, no. He'll never believe us.
We need documentation.
Hurry up, come on,
she's coming.
- I don't want to. How do you
know if she's here or not?
-Just drop it.
Drop it. I see her.
Just... come on, drop it.
She's picking it up.
Yes, we got her now.
Let's go.
Thanks for coming by.
I assure you, everything's
being done that can be done.
At this point,
I have no reason to
disagree with Dr. Feldman.
That's very... Yeah.
If he smiles at us,
she's getting better.
If he looks angry,
things are getting worse.
- Please call me. There's no charge.
- Thanks very much.
What if he looks
like he always looks?
Aah! Look, why don't
we study in our room?
Because my desk
isn't big enough,
and I have finals today.
Well, hurry up
and eat your breakfast
or you'll miss the bus.
The bus doesn't come
for half an hour.
- I can't eat these!
- Why not?
They look like doody cakes!
Mommy lets me make my own.
We're not making anything,
and you're not leaving the table
until you eat every bite.
All right, all right,
give me that!
All right, that's...
Young lady!
All right, all right!
All right!
Turn this... Oh! Oh!
Sandra! Sandy!
That's it!
Young lady, you clean up
this mess right now!
You're not our mother!
You just work here.
And once our father finds out
that you've been stealing...
- that won't be for long.
- Stealing?
- Yes, stealing.
- I've never stolen a nickel
in my life!
- It was a quarter.
- And I've got the proof
on film.
How... dare you!
I am doing the best I can
to try to keep this house
in order...
taking on much more
responsibility than was
first described to me!
And with no extra pay,
I might add.
I should think the two of you
could try to be
of a little more help...
what with your mother
dying upstairs.
What?
Well, I mean...
I...
She is not dying.
- I just think the two
of you could try to be...
- She's not dying.
- It's not too much to ask
for more cooperation from you.
- She's not dying.
You understand me?
Steven! Steven!
You open this door right now.
I'm not kidding.
I'm not playing.
- Steven Lidz!
- I'm scared. I'm scared.
- Shh, shh, quiet.
- Steven Lidz. Open this door, Steven.
Steven, immediately.
All right.
- I'll go check.
- No, don't.
- Yes.
- Don't go.
Aah! Help!
- No!
-You come outta there, both of you!
I want to talk to you
right now! Out!
- What did I tell you?
- I want to address
a few things with you.
Amelia just quit.
She was a bad lady.
She told a lie.
- What lie?
- She said Mommy's dying.
Mom?
Mom?
Hey, Lidz,
you too good to put your trash
out with everybody else?
I want the junk outta here!
Do you understand that?
I'll tell you what.
I'll call the fire department.
I'll call everybody
at city hall.
This is my building.
My building, Lidz.
You understand that?
You hear me in there?
I'm sick and tired of it.
I work hard!
You make me nuts!
I'll get them outta here.
I'll run them right the hell
outta here.
Uncle Arthur?
Uncle Danny, please?
I never get any quiet
around here,
for crying out loud. Hey!
- Hey, kid, get over here!
- Let me in!
- You're involved in this too, huh?
- Steven!
- What are you doing here?
- Let me in!
- All right, come on. Come on.
- Come here! Hey!
Ow! Ow!
- Come here!
- Uncle Danny!
What are you doin' there?
Hey, come over here! Hey!
- All right! All right!
- Hey! Hey, Lidz, open that door!
- Open that door! Look, you two.
- Barricade the door!
Use those books.
There's more at the end
of the hall. Hurry!
I'll be back!
You can rest assure
of that!
I will be back!
Uncle Danny?
Uncle Arthur?
Uncle Danny?
Uncle Arthur?
Whoa!
Uncle Danny?
Uncle Arthur?
Uncle Danny!
Uncle Arthur!
Hello?
Aaah!
Uncle Danny?
Uncle Arthur?
Hmm. You must
be hungry. Sit.
I couldn't find any books,
Uncle Danny.
Exactly.
They burned them.
That's part of their plan.
Fascist bastards!
Boy, you have a lot
of newspapers.
Yeah, well, we've been busy.
We haven't had time
to read them.
Baruch ata adonai Elohainu
melech ha-olam...
- she-hakol nee-yah bidvaro.
- Amen.
Arthur, give me
a high bouncer.
So, you ran away, hmm?
You couldn't stand
the hypocrisy, could you?
Is that a good one?
It's got to be a good one.
Yes! Arthur,
give this boy the high bouncer.
- He's earned it.
- What do I do?
- Go ahead.
- Here.
- Hit your head?
- Do it to him.
Do it again.
Oh-oh-oh!
On the table.
On the table. Here.
All right, here, look.
Heigh-ho!
You do it.
High bouncers!
Okeydokey! Higher, higher!
Hundreds of high bouncers!
Ohh! Bull's-eye!
People throw away a lot
of things that are good.
I mean, so here are, um...
some basic household items
that you might find
in anybody's house.
And over here are some other
items that you would find...
maybe only in
abandoned warehouses...
or in empty boxcars,
Or...
But who's to say that those
aren't homes to somebody?
Here's something.
I wanna show you something.
These are dreams
that I've had.
See, dreams are...
they're like memories.
They're easy to lose.
- Then how do you keep track of' em?
- I file them alphabetically.
Is that Grandma fanny?
Yeah!
It's a shame
that you never met her.
- How'd she die?
- Influenza.
Really?
Yes, yes.
I think this is going to work.
Steven, come here.
Come here!
- Stand there. Stand right there.
- Ohh!
Now if you hear Lindquist
or his accomplices...
you just get in the box,
play dumb like
you don't know anything.
- Who's Lindquist?
- Exactly.
Time for sleep.
Lights out.
Danny! Arthur!
It's Sid. Open the door.
Danny? Arthur?
Sid?
Why don't you get a phone
so people can call you
in an emergency?
Your question
is also your answer!
- What does that mean?
- It means what it means.
- Is Steven here?
- I don't want to go, Uncle Arthur.
I know, I know.
I don't want you to go.
- Please, open the door.
- Wait, wait.
I don't want to go.
I got you something.
-What is it?
- Open the door!
It's, um...
to put things in.
But not, not, um...
not Cracker Jacks
or music...
'cause they already
got boxes for themselves.
It's for important things.
Things that you don't want
to disappear.
Where is he?
Hi, Dad.
- Get your things.
Let's go.
- This is it.
I can't believe you would do
this to your mother. She's been
up all night worried sick.
She insisted on coming out
which is not good for her!
- Mom's here?
- Yes, she's here. That's right.
Wait a... Wait a minute.
I am talking to you.
What the hell
did you do?
What the hell
were you thinking?
Come here.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Come on, get in the car.
- I want to stay.
- What?
- I want to stay.
- No! Absolutely not.
There's no discussion here.
- It's, it's just until...
- Until what?
Until you get better.
Sid?
Well?
All right...
but just for a while.
Okay.
- You check the food.
- I will.
- Check the beds.
- Okay.
- Check for rats.
- Mm-hmm.
You have my permission
not to listen to anything
they say.
You have to be a man.
Just pretend you're livin'
with Dopey and... Dopey.
Steven, please don't ever,
ever do this again.
I won't.
Mom, what's influenza?
Influenza is...
It's a cold,
a very bad cold. Why?
I don't know.
- Take care of him.
- Yeah, we will.
Mom!
Hey!
- Steven, hurry!
- Steven, Lindquist!
- Hey!
- Steven, come on, hurry!
- Lidz!
- Steven, hurry, run, run!
Take my hand.
- Let's settle this man-to-man.
Come back here, you cowards!
- Take my hand. Take my hand.
- In here, in here. Hurry!
- Come back here!
Lidz, come back here!
Get over here!
We gotta
get away from Lindquist.
Hurry! Steven, run!
Up the stairs!
Up the stairs! Hurry!
- Ah, ah, run, Steven!
- Where's Uncle Arthur?
It's every man for himself!
Quick, there's no time!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Run!
Hey!
I want to talk to you!
Come on!
Come on, Steven!
Run!
Come on! Come on!
- Hey, get back here!
- Run. He's a beast.
The beast is coming!
- Lidz? Lidz!
- Here we go.
Come here, come here.
I wanna talk to you.
- No, no, no!
- I want to talk to you.
- Open this door!
- You hungry?
- Boy, you've got a lot of crackers.
- I had coupons.
Window?
Aaah!
Baruch ata adonai
Elohainu melech...
ha-olam she-hakol
nee-yeh bidvaro. Amen.
- Where did Uncle Arthur go?
- Well, on Tuesdays and Fridays...
he escorts blind Mr. Clements
from across the hall
to the park.
Of course, he has his collecting.
Mr. Lidz, guess what?
- On Friday the 23rd, three weeks...
- Hey, wait, wait a minute.
There's a city inspector
coming to check for fire
hazards in your apartment.
And you know somethin'?
If all that junk
isn't outta here...
you and yours are gonna
be out in the street.
Out in the street!
I got you, Lidz.
Have yourself a great day.
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know, I don't know.
I've gotta think.
Make sure the doors are locked,
and see if you can rig up
some sort of alarm system.
Wait. Me?
I don't know anything
about alarm systems!
He's not going to get away
with this, I assure you.
Action must be taken.
An offensive plan.
He's made a big mistake if he
thinks I'm giving up so soon.
Possible ideas.
Available...
ma... ter... i... als.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm. Mmm.
- These are good.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.
-They're good. Very good.
Have you arrived
at a plan yet?
-Well, I'm, uh,
I'm gathering information.
- Excellent.
You keep me posted, hmm?
- Mmm-mmm.
- Umm-umm-umm.
And I flipped 'em over
when they got all bubbly...
and then I gave 'em to 'em,
and they came out great,
just like yours.
- They were so good, Mom.
Arthur ate 25.
- That's wonderful, honey.
Uncle Danny loved 'em too,
but he thought they
might be bugged.
- They want 'em everyday
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
-They do, do they?
Oh, I better go.
Uncle Danny says we can't use
one phone for too long or else
the conspirators can trace us.
- Who? Steven?
- I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.
Good-bye.
- Lindquist,
I got a package here.
- Relax, I'm comin'!
Jesus! For cryin'
out loud. I can't even
grab any rest around here.
Can't even watch a little TV,
for cryin' out loud.
- Hackman, tell
Mr. Denmarrand Mr. Vallechin...
that their packages
are finally here.
I gotta get this phone.
The phone is always ringin'.
Hello. Yeah, hey,
hiya, honey.
What? Right now?
I know, but, Ruby,
Truth or Consequences is on.
Yeah, hello.
Yeah, this is Lindquist.
Harvey Lindquist.
Congratulations! You just won
two great tickets...
to Truth or Consequences
on Friday the 23rd.
Can you make it?
Great.
Phase one is complete.
Those idiots
are gonna make me late for
Truth or Consequences now.
Damn!
- Mr. Lindquist?
- Yeah.
- I'm Mr. Marshall from
the city inspection department.
- Yeah.
- I've come to see, uh...
- Yeah, the problem in 2-B. You're late.
All right, listen. It's up
at the top of the stairs.
You have permission to go
into there. If you have any
trouble with these clowns...
you just call the police.
2-B, top of the stairs.
You're late, get up there.
- Hello! You must be from the city?
- Yes.
Well, yes, Mr. Marshall.
Well, we've been expecting you.
Do come in.
- May I take your hat?
- Did you have a difficult time
finding the place?
Would you like
a cup of coffee?
Sugar? Cream?
- And what happened?
- It was great.
- He was in and out in 20 minutes.
-Yeah. Let me.
I suggested he recommend
Mr. Harvey Lindquist for
mandatory psychiatric care.
And he said, get this...
he would think about it.
- Our Steven has a rare gift.
- Steven! Oh, yes, he does.
- Steven. Is that your real name?
- Yeah.
All right, now hang up.
We've angered them.
There's gonna be repercussions.
Mommy! Mommy, look what
came in the mail today.
Oh, wow.
Let's see.
"Confidential
and personal."
Sandy, come over here.
I need you for a moment.
Okay.
Oh, my God!
He's becoming one of them.
I station myself here
to catch all the lost balls
of the city...
that are washed down
the gutters and the sewers.
Then what do you do with 'em?
I save 'em.
- I don't trade the balls ever.
- Why not?
Because they're special.
You know how...
how seashells hold
the sound of the ocean?
Yeah, yeah.
I think balls hold
the sounds of the children
who bounce them.
See, but...
it's very faint.
See?
I think only dogs
can hear it.
Uncle Arthur!
- Here I am.
- Hey, Uncle Arthur, look.
It's much easier with this.
The ball falls into the net,
and the water flows out.
Say, if there were two balls,
you wouldn't be able
to catch 'em regularly.
You're a genius!
Hey, Mom...
Uncle Danny said
the Lindquist solution
I thought of was genius.
We switched the numbers
on the door, completely
fooled the inspector.
- It was so great.
- Really, dear?
That just sounds wonderful.
- I am so glad you could
help your uncles.
- Me too.
- Sid!
- Well, I have to hang up now.
Mr. Clements
is coming back. I'll
call back later, okay?
- I love you, Mom. Bye.
-Wha... Steven.
Steven? Steven.
Oh, God.
Sidney!
- Steven.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, Sidney.
- What is this?
- Oh, electrical tape.
My glasses broke.
- You don't wear glasses.
- He's disguising himself.
- It's a minor precaution
in case of repercussions.
It's nothing
to worry about, Sid.
Now, come on.
What's in the bag?
Oh, it's a present
for Mommy.
It's a record of
one of her favorite songs,
"My Reverie."
- It's this old 79.
- You mean a 78.
No, this one's 79.
It's on the label.
Listen, Arthur, there's
no such thing as a 79.
Records are 33, 45
and 78 R.P.M.
- Yeah, but this one's 79.
- It's faster.
- What do you mean, it's faster?
- It's a little faster.
I'm telling you,
records don't go faster
than 78.
- Well, this one's 79. It says.
- Arthur!
Arthur, the turntable
determines the speed,
not the record.
- Maybe where you come from.
- What do you mean, where I come from?
- I come from where you come from.
- No, no. You come...
from the land of the dense,
the tribe of the Girgashite.
- What does that mean? I'd like to know.
- I t means what it means.
It doesn't mean anything.
It's beyond meaning.
- It doesn't mean anything to you.
- You see what can happen to
an undisciplined mind? Hmm?
- Dad, it is a 78 R.P.M.
- I know that.
But it cost 79 cents.
See?
There you go.
All right.
Watch your step.
Don't step
on the cracks.
- I think she's in one, two, three...
- she's 18 from Levy.
- I think it's... Danny, she's
in the fourth row, I think.
- Over there.
- Eighteen from Levy.
- All right? Arthur?
- Eighteen from Levy.
- Yeah.
There's Levy.
There's Levy.
- That's Israel.
- No, Levy behind it.
- She would've liked him.
- Oh, she would've loved him.
- Our Steven has a rare gift.
- Well, a blind man can see that.
But that name, Steven,
is so ordinary.
It lacks something.
- I know. I wasn't
gonna say anything, but...
- it should be changed.
- Change my name?
- Danny, that's enough.
He's a Lidz, Sidney.
He should be named
after an ancestor.
Don't you think she has
enough presents, Arthur?
It's her birthday,
Sidney.
Here, you see?
It's makeup.
A powder puff.
So, Ma, if you feel sad,
you can put on a little makeup,
make you feel better.
Happy birthday,
Mom.
Happy birthday.
That was Steven.
- I've got it.
- What?
Franz.
- Franz Lidz.
- Franz.
It has a ring to it.
Franz. Yeah, Franz.
Wow!
First of all, Franz Liszt
is not an ancestor.
Second of all, his name
was spelled S-Z-T not D-Z.
- Well, those Ellis Island
idiots got it wrong!
- Yeah. They were bad spellers.
Franz Lidz!
Oh, you're the one
to look out for.
- His name is Steven.
- Oh, Franz.
Yes, you're the one to watch!
- His name is Steven.
- What about a middle name?
I should just take
a rocket to Venus.
- Maybe I can find
some intelligent life there.
-You should packa good lunch.
- What?
- Yeah, he's right. It's a long trip.
Yeah. You might not like
what they got to eat there.
Come on, Steven!
Come on.
- You're Franz.
- Franz.
Say it, say it.
Franz Lidz!
- Franz!
- Franz!
- Franz Lidz!
- I am Franz!
Hi, Franz.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- When did this start?
- More coffee?
Please.
Just wanna let you know,
this'll be another 20 cents.
Wait a minute.
The sign here says, "Coffee,
all you can drink, 20 cents."
Yeah, the sign I know.
It means that that's all
you can drink for 20 cents.
No one in their right mind
would read it that way.
- I did.
- You see?
- That just proves my point.
- Well, you don't know, Sid.
See? You don't know.
- For once, can't you just admit
you misread a simple sign?
- Shut up.
Just shut up!
- May I have the salt, Franz?
- His name is Steven!
What are you doing
teaching my son to pray?
You had no right!
Everything I stand for...
is to be able to have
these kids to believe in
their own abilities...
not some fairy story
about God in heaven!
You know where heaven is?
In the minds of morons.
- Well, you're wrong, Sidney.
- What?
You're wrong, because
when you desert the beliefs of
your father, you're in Gehenna.
- Now, it happens. One day...
- Bullshit!
- What's Gehenna?
- It's the valley of lamentation,
the valley of groaning!
It's the valley
south of Jerusalem where
they burn their garbage.
- It's not garbage, it's junk.
- Religion is a crutch.
Only cripples need crutches.
A crutch isn't bad
if you need it, Sidney.
- Yeah.
- All of us are cripples
in some way.
Well, I'm not!
Your mother and I have decided
you're coming home.
- What?
- Ooh!
We'll drop Danny
and Arthur off.
and then you're going home.
Enough's enough.
Summer's over.
Now, finish up.
- I don't want to hit traMc.
- But I don't wanna go!
Your mother and I
want you home,
and that's the end of it.
This for the lady,
with the tip.
- All the coffee she wants.
- Mmm.
Sweetie
Hi!
- Hi.
- Hi!
Ah, that is some outfit.
Yeah.
Come here.
Gimme a hug.
You know, I'm feeling
much better. We have
your father to thank.
He's been blasting me
with positive ions.
Ooh! Ooh!
Seems to be working.
Maybe we should try it
on your Uncle Danny.
Careful, that's Steven's rabbi
you're joking about.
- Dad, my name is Franz now.
- What?
Franz. Well, Uncle Danny
said I needed a new name,
so he gave me Franz.
Franz? Franz Lidz?
Oh, Steven!
- Franz, Mom. Franz.
- Sid?
Don't look at me.
Danny's got him reciting
the Torah in a coffee shop.
- Dad, it's not the Torah.
- And if I told you once
I told you a hundred times...
to keep the windows closed.
- He also said that I should be
bar mitzvahed if I want
to become a man.
- What?
- That's ridiculous!
- We need our rituals to rise
above the patterns of history.
- Who said that?
- I did.
- What does it mean?
- It means what it means.
I pledge allegiance...
- to the flag...
- # Stand up
all victims of oppression #
- Of the United States of America...
- # for the tyrants fear your might #
- And to the republic
for which it stands...
- # Don't cling so hard #
- # To your possessions #
- One nation under God...
- # You have nothing
if you have no rights #
- One moment! Class!
- # Let racist ignorance #
- Class! Class!
- # Be ended #
- Steven Lidz!
- # Makes the empire str... #
- Steven, wait!
- What are you doing?
- My name is Franz.
The attendance card here
says your name is Steven.
Call me Franz
or call me nothing.
- # So freedom is merely privilege #
- Excuse me.
- # Extended unless enjoyed #
- Let's go, mister. Let's go. Let's go.
-# By one and all #
-Would you all please take your seats?
- # So come brothers... #
- Okay, Steven. What do
you think you're singing?
- "The Internationale." It's one
of my uncle's favorite songs.
- Well, that is very nice...
and maybe you can sing that
for us for show-and-tell...
but right now,
we are all reciting
the Pledge of Allegiance.
- I can't do that.
It's against my beliefs.
- Your beliefs?
- What does that mean?
- It means what it means.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
How can I pledge my allegiance
to a county that suffers
fools and mediocrity?
- Not to mention cruci_ing
the Rosenbergs!
- S-Steven!
- # So for brothers and sisters #
- Let's hear it for franz! Come on!
- Whoo! franz.
- All right, class, that's enough.
Yea, Franz!
Whoo-hoo!
# The Internationale #
Hey, Lidz,
wait up.
Hey, that was pretty cool
what you said in class.
You should run
for president again.
Nancy Oppenheim
said the same thing.
- What'd you say?
- I declined the nomination.
- That's cool. Where you goin'?
- The spillway.
I was thinking
of fishing for lost balls.
Wanna come?
- Yeah!
- I'll show you the way.
My real name's
Ashley William Robinson...
but I only answer
to Ash.
- My father shot himself.
- I know.
I found the body.
It was really bloody.
- My mom's dying.
- Yeah, I heard about that.
- That means you'll probably get a dog.
- Why?
I don't know. It's just
they always give kids dogs
when their parents croak.
Rabbi Blaustein?
Yes?
I'm Franz Lidz.
Good. Come on in.
Sit down.
# Shema Israel #
# Adonai Elohainu #
# Adonai echad #
# Shema Israel #
# Adonai Elohainu #
# Adonai echad #
Mmm.
What would've happened
if I hadn't called?
Steven should've been here.
- Where the hell is he?
Studying the Torah?
- Don't blame him.
It's not his fault.
I don't see what harm
it's gonna do.
- It's hypocritical.
We're not practicing Jews.
- It's what he believes in.
He doesn't know what
he believes. My brothers
filled him with all that junk.
Maybe they're right for once.
What would you know?
You work ten hours a day,
then you lock yourself up
in that workshop.
What do you know
about the world?
Maybe there is a God.
Or maybe some of us
want to believe there is.
I can't talk
about this anymore.
Let's get in the car.
Okay?
The doctor's
on his way.
This is the last time, Sid.
I'm not going back.
No more hospitals.
That's it.
Is your uncle
really crazy?
Which one?
Uncle Danny or Uncle Arthur?
- I'll take care of this.
- All right.
-Who is it?
- It's me, Uncle Danny.
- Franz.
-Ah, Franz.
- What? No.
- No. No, wait.
Wait, Uncle Danny.
Listen to me.
No, i-it's okay.
He's with me.
He's one of us.
Oh, well, then,
I'm sure he won't mind
answering a few questions.
No, of course not.
How many trustworthy people
are there in the world?
- Eight. Eight.
- Um, eight.
Uh-huh. Okay.
Which of your cohorts
is a fascist smear monger?
I got this.
That'd be Ralph Crispi, sir.
Come on. Hurry.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Here, Uncle Danny.
The rabbi says he needs
your signature here and here.
What is that,
a disease?
- No, it's a pimple.
- Uncle Danny?
- Huh?
- I need your signature here.
Oh, yes, yes.
I'll look at this.
- Thanks.
- Yes.
When's he gonna do somethin'
really nutsy?
I don't know.
I can't wind him up like a toy.
Got an idea...
a really good idea.
- That's it. It's perfect.
- I don't know.
Well, go on. Just stick it
under the door and say
someone delivered it.
- I don't want to.
- It's just a joke. Come on.
- I don't know.
- Go on.
Here you are.
How's your studies going?
- Um, th-they're goin' fine. Fine.
- Mmm.
- What's that?
- Oh, it's, it's nothing. It's just...
Somebody slipped it
under the door.
- When?
- While you were in your room.
- Uncle Danny.
- He's freaking out.
What the hell happened,
huh?
- He locked himself inside his room.
- What's goin' on?
He won't come out.
- Arthur?
- Yeah?
- Arthur!
- Yeah?
- Arthur?
- Yeah?
- What's goin' on?
- He's in the room and he won't come out.
Danny?
Danny, open the door.
- Danny, stop this nonsense
and open the door.
- No, no, don't.
You're gonna frighten him.
- Enough already.
You'll frighten him.
Danny? Danny?
Danny, enough already!
- Open the door!
- Sidney, you're scarin' him.
What do you want me to do,
Arthur? I'm taking care
of it, all right?
Danny, open the door!
Danny, I'm gonna
break down the damn door
if you don't open it!
- You all right?
- I have to go. I have to leave now.
- Oh, okay.
- I'm gonna go now.
All right.
Should I get your coat?
Danny, wait.
Where, where're you goin'?
I'll go.
Wow!
This guy is really nuts!
- He's really nuts!
- No, he's not!
- Steven!
- Steven!
C'mon, we're gonna be late.
We still have to pick up
your mother. Let's go.
- Wait. You're not taking
the movie camera?
- No.
Why not? You mean,
you're not gonna film
my bar mitzvah?
We need to get through this
as easily as possible today.
- Let's not make it complicated.
Just get in the car, okay?
- But...
- I bet Mom would like
to have it on film.
- I said no.
But...
- Well, is Uncle Danny coming?
- No.
- Why not?
- 'Cause he can't, that's why not.
He committed himself
last night.
Good. Good.
Oh, honey,
please don't.
- I... baby, I look so awful.
- Come on, Mom.
- Ahh. No, you don't.
- Oh, baby.
You look beautiful.
- So how you doing, kiddo?
- Okay.
- You feel like a man yet?
- Not really.
- You think Uncle Danny'll get better?
- I don't know, honey.
I'm sure he missed
being here very much.
You know,
you could go see him.
I was thinking tomorrow
I would make pancakes.
Would you like that?
Sure, but...
y-you don't have
to make breakfast.
- I can make you pancakes
just like yours.
- Ooh.
You make 'em
that good, huh?
You know,
I am so proud of you.
Do you know
how proud I am?
Would you just do me
one favor?
Ty to love your dad
a bit more.
It's not easy being
from another planet.
Mom...
a-are you...
Are you dying?
Yes, I am, Franz.
I'm so sorry.
Uncle Danny?
Franz!
Good to see you.
Uncle Danny,
there's something
I wanna tell you.
What?
We wrote that note,
me and Ash.
- Ahh.
- It was a mean joke.
- I'm really, really sorry.
This is all my fault.
- No, no, no.
Don't be sorry.
I'm grateful to you.
You ended it.
See, I didn't know how.
Oh, really?
Well, then, you can
come home, right?
- No, no, I can't.
- But...
B-But Uncle Arthur needs you.
He's lost without you.
- You should be with your brother.
- Well, I can't.
Why not?
Are you still hiding
from conspirators?
There's no conspiracy!
Now, listen.
Are you listening?
You forget about me.
You're gonna be busy enough
with your father.
- He's the one that needs you now.
- No, he doesn't!
Yes, he does.
Franz, don't you see?
People, they get trapped
in their own history unless
someone shows them a way out.
- But I don't know how.
- Oh, don't you worry.
You're gonna figure a way.
Remember,
you're the one to watch.
- No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.
You're the one to watch.
# The other night #
# As I lay sleepin' #
# Whoa
I dreamed I held you #
# Held you in my arms #
- # Oh, but when I woke up
this mornin'#
No, stir it like this
so the egg gets

- He dances like you.

What we gotta do

We gotta make sure

They look good.
Just a little bit more though.
- Hey, Mommy.
- You're a good helper.
Thank you.
What about,
um, rectangles?
Yeah, you can make rectangle
shapes. You can make
all different kinds of shapes.
- Triangle?
- Yeah, any kind.
- You're a great cook.
- You're a great mom.
- Even a square?
- Yeah, even a square.

- # I don't want you to take #
- # Don't take my sunshine #
- # My sunshine away #
- # Shine away ##
Maybe a dog.
Something to make happiness
in the house.
A little levity.
It'll be better than all this
gloom and doom, you know?
- She just died.
- I don't
want to see them hurtin'.
And this right here,
it's a bolt.
- It's a bolt you could use as a lock.
- Come outside with me.
- What the hell do you think
you're doing, huh?
- Let go of me!
What the hell is wrong
with you? Stop it, now!
Give it to me!
- But you said
documentation is important.
- Forget what I said!
I put up with
this nonsense with you
when your mother was alive.
- But no more! Your name is Steven.
- My name is Franz.
Steven!
She picked it out...
and she asked me
if I thought
it was a good name.
I said, "yes,
it's a good name."
It was
her brother's name.
Now, no more.
Just stop it.
Your name is Steven.
Anyway, look.
Laundry, baby-sitting,
food, we're here.
- We're here for you. We're family.
- Wha...
- You call us, please. Bye, baby.
- Aw, darling.
- All right.
- Okay. Bye, bye. Bye.
Go upstairs...
to your Uncle Arthur, okay?
Steven?
Steven.
Steven?
Steven?
Steven?
Steven?
- Can I help you?
- I, I know where I'm going.
Sir!
- Where is he?
- Who?
Steven!
Where is he?
I don't know
what the hell he's thinking.
Where're we going?
I have no idea
where we're going.
Arthur, did you
see him leaving?
-The last time I saw him
he was by the junkcans.
- Mm-hmm.
- What was he doin'?
- He was takin' the movies out.
What? You didn't
tell me that, Arthur!
Well, you didn't ask me
what he was doing.
You know, it's not right
to throw memories away, Sidney.
He just needs
to say good-bye.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't, don't shut it off.
I...
couldn't find you.
I'm...
I'm sorry, Dad.
- What do you have there?
- Mmm, just a bunch of different ones.
They're not labeled.
I think...
we should label them.
Documentation.
They should be labeled.
Okay. Well,
tomorrow I'll do that.
