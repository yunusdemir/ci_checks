We should hit one of those clubs.
Derek, are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I just thought I saw
somebody I know.
Somebody you know,
or somebody you'd like to know?
He can't be tempted.
Can't blame him.
Too scared of Sharon.
Speaking of Sharon, I said
I'd call her. I'll be right back.
Hey. Hey, babe.
<i>How's th</i>e <i>mal</i>e <i>bonding?</i>
As you can guess,
everybody's wasted.
In about half an hour, I'll be able...
<i>D</i>e<i>r</i>e<i>k, ar</i>e <i>you th</i>e<i>r</i>e<i>?</i>
<i>Wait, I think Kyl</i>e <i>wants</i>
<i>to say good night.</i>
<i>D</i>e<i>r</i>e<i>k, ar</i>e <i>you still th</i>e<i>r</i>e<i>?</i>
- Babe, I gotta call you right back.
- <i>It'll just tak</i> e <i>a s</i>e<i>cond.</i>
<i>- Say good night to Daddy.</i>
- They're calling for me to come back.
- Honey, I'm gonna call you right back.
<i>- D</i>e<i>r</i>e<i>k?</i>
Derek?
Was that Sharon?
I can always tell from
the pained look on your face...
...when you've been talking to her.
How did you know I'd be here?
What's wrong? You don't look happy
to see me.
I'm not happy to see you.
What are you doing here?
You said that you would
never jeopardise your job.
That's why I quit,
so that we could be together.
You misunderstood me.
I'm married, happily married.
There will never be us...
...together, ever.
You're worried what Joe and Ben
might think.
I'll tell you what they'll think.
They'll think that we arranged it
and we did.
What are you talking about?
I see what you're doing.
One of us has to take charge,
and I guess that's gonna be me.
So you go back and you say your
good nights to the boys, and...
...l'll be waiting in my room, 610.
I'm not coming to your room.
- You want me to come to yours?
- You're sick.
- You need help.
- I know.
Help me, Derek.
You stay away from me.
- Sharon?
<i>- Sharon?</i>
<i>It's B</i>e<i>n.</i>
<i>Dud</i>e<i>, you don</i>e <i>for th</i>e <i>night?</i>
No. I'm coming back.
<i>H</i>e<i>y, com</i>e <i>on, D, it's</i> e<i>arly.</i>
Let's hit my room, plunder the minibar,
charge it to Joe.
No, I, I can't. That last drink
totally kicked my ass, man.
All right, drunky. Don't forget,
9 a.m. tomorrow, Tiffany Room.
Joe's big rah-rah to the troops.
Yeah, 9 a.m.
Lightweight.
Out.
Baby.
No.
Does that feel good?
No.
Hush, baby.
No, please, stop.
Does that feel good?
Housekeeping.
- Sharon?
- Oh, sorry.
Oh, God.
Oh, shit.
Of course,
we here at Gage Bendix...
...have a couple advantages
over the competition...
...not the least of which is the fact
that we are privately held.
We don't worry about the transparency
required of public companies.
Thank God, I was thinking
of sending out a search party.
I'm sorry. I overslept.
You overslept.
The second great advantage
is that most of our clients...
...are high-net-worth individuals
more concerned...
...with preservation of capital than in
outsized gains in any single year...
You all know
how to read a bar chart.
What is important here
is putting your clients at ease.
One of the things I suggest
going forward in this difficult time...
...the credit crunch,
whatever you want to call it...
...is that they understand
that America is on sale.
Excuse me, sir, your wife is here.
- It's Sharon.
- What about her?
She's here.
Excuse me, Joe.
At any rate, I want to make sure that
you can go with confidence and say...
Here's your wife, sir.
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you woke up. I went to the spa.
What are you doing?
I thought you'd need an excuse
to get out of there.
- You wanna get some lunch?
- Lunch?
Yeah, it's gorgeous outside.
I made a reservation...
Hey.
What do you think this is?
The morning after.
We didn't do anything last night.
You don't remember?
- Last night was perfect.
- Nothing happened!
Baby, not so loud.
It'll cause a scene.
A scene?
Right. That's exactly what we need.
- What are you doing?
- I wanna give you a scene.
I'll take you into Joe and the rest
so you can tell them all that...
- Why ruin this?
- There is no "this."
Don't say that.
Goddamn it, come here.
What's wrong with you?
Why are you acting like a stranger?
That is exactly what I am to you, a
stranger, somebody you do not know.
Now either you go in there...
...and you tell them your lies,
or you leave me the hell alone.
Don't you put this all on me, Derek.
We both knew what we were getting
into from the very beginning.
What?
The first time we met in the elevator.
Our dirty martini.
The Christmas party.
You said that you wished you were
single so that we could be together.
No. No, I did not.
- You did! You said it!
- No! I did not!
Derek, you said it.
You said it.
If I go in that room and tell them,
it'll be the truth.
Is that what you want?
You want me to tell them the truth?
Ready when you are.
Hey, hey.
Listen to me!
What are you doing?
Hit me. You can do
anything you want to me.
You know what?
It doesn't matter what you do or what
you say or what goes on in that brain...
...because there's never gonna be
anything between us, never.
Okay, Lisa?
Derek.
Derek?
Derek?
I realise we went a little long.
I thought some of the questions you
raised were worth going over...
...and I apologise for the length of it.
Those of you with tee times, and I
have one myself, we will still make...
Everything okay?
- Top you off.
- Thank you.
- D?
- Oh, no, no, thanks.
You're not drinking?
No, not this evening, man.
I'm sticking to the iced tea.
That's a first.
- You feeling all right?
- Yeah.
He's just growing up.
Man.
No goddamn way. Come on.
No. Hey. Hey, get up.
Hey. Lisa.
Come on, get up, get up.
You can't stay here.
Come on. I'll drag you out of here.
Let's...
No. No, no, no.
I need a paramedic up here at 583.
I have a woman in the room.
I think she's overdosed on some sort
of prescription pills.
Yeah, yeah. Hurry! Now, please!
Okay.
Breathe. Breathe.
Bitch, breathe.
- Derek. What's going on?
- I'll call you.
Hello?
Hi, Ben. It's Sharon.
Hi, Sharon, hi.
<i>I'm sorry to disturb you.</i>
I was trying to reach Derek,
and he usually calls me by now.
I can't reach him on his cell phone.
I was hoping he might be with you?
Yeah, there... There was
a kind of incident.
Is he all right?
Ben?
I think he should tell you himself.
Ben, you're scaring me now.
Where is he?
Excuse me. Is she okay?
The doctors are still working on her.
Derek. Oh, my God. I've been worried
out of my mind. Are you okay?
What are you doing here? It's okay,
it's okay. I'm good, I'm good.
- Where's Kyle?
- Julie is watching him.
- What happened?
- Sharon.
Mr. Charles. How you doing?
My name is Monica Reese.
I'm the investigating detective.
- Detective?
- Yeah. This is my wife, Sharon.
- She just got here.
- So you haven't told her?
- What?
- Would you prefer to talk in private?
- In private? What's happening, Derek?
- It's okay. Please, we can talk.
I've gone over the initial statement
you gave to the police on the scene.
I just need to clarify a few things,
okay?
Let's sit down.
Detective Reese, 0300 hours,
January 15th.
This young woman, Lisa Sheridan,
she works in your office?
Lisa the temp?
What happened to her?
Yeah, she tried to hurt herself.
Why? What? Well, what did she do?
Mrs. Charles, I'm sorry.
I need to get the story
in your husband's own words.
Apparently, so do I.
Mr. Charles, this Lisa Sheridan...
Yeah, she worked with us
two weeks.
What, you've only known her
for two weeks?
Approximately two weeks.
Long enough for her to fantasize
that you two were having an affair?
- What?
- No. No.
She came on to me
at the Christmas party...
...and then in the parking garage.
And then she showed up
at the retreat...
...at my hotel, and I rejected her.
And when... Excuse me.
And when you rejected her...
...she tried to commit suicide, naked,
in your bed, in your hotel room.
Wait, wait, wait. She was naked
in your bed, Derek?
- Mrs. Charles.
- She was naked in your hotel room?
Please.
- Would you say this affair was...
- There was no affair.
There was no affair.
You're saying she made the thing up
in her head with no help from you?
That is exactly what I'm saying.
Why do you think she'd pick you?
I don't know. Maybe I said something
that she took the wrong way.
- Baby, come on.
- Like what? Like what?
What exactly did you say
that she took the wrong way, Derek?
- I'm gonna have to ask you to le...
- No, no, she's not going anywhere.
I didn't say anything to her.
I did not lead her on.
You had no idea she'd be
at the hotel?
I don't know how she got
in my room.
She told the hotel clerk she was your
wife and she wanted to surprise you.
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Stop, Sharon.
- Did you have sex with her?
- No, I did not...
...have sex with her.
Sharon, come on. I need for you and I
not to fall apart right now.
- Mr. Charles. Please.
- Hold on.
Just stay here.
Please just stay here.
Look, I don't care if you're doing
this girl or not.
I'm not doing this girl, okay?
Never have.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Detective?
It's the doctor. I'll be right back.
Sharon.
I swear to God
this is just a misunderstanding.
A misunderstanding.
A girl tries to kill herself because of
you, it's just a misunderstanding?
You think I'm gonna believe that?
- Do you believe me?
- No, I don't believe you!
- You didn't even call your son back...
- Sharon, listen.
Seems they pumped her out in time.
Probably tomorrow they'll take her
out of the ICU...
...and take her up to the fifth floor
for psychiatric evaluation.
That's great news. Okay, thank you.
She was lucid enough to give a name
to the doctor in case of emergencies.
You still wanna stick to your story?
Sharon. Sharon,
you gonna talk to me?
Thanks, Julie. I'll call you tomorrow.
Sharon, is everything okay?
Julie. Hey, thank you.
Sharon.
Sharon.
Hey.
Sharon.
Can we talk?
Sharon, I just... Now listen,
Sharon, all I wanna do...
What, what, what, Derek? What?
What do you want?
- I just wanna talk to you.
- Now you wanna talk.
- Sharon, you know me.
- No, I don't know you.
I don't know you. I know the Derek
that told me everything.
- Oh, come on.
- But you? I have no idea who you are.
Sharon, I was wrong.
If I hadn't gone to the ER,
if I hadn't called Ben...
...would you have even told me?
What are you, crazy?
Of course I would have.
Like you told me
about the Christmas party, huh?
Or what about the parking garage?
Yes, you told me about you being
in a parking garage with this woman.
What else haven't you told me,
Derek?
All I'm hearing
are things you haven't told me.
I was wrong. I should've told you
the truth from the...
You should have! Why didn't you?
Because I didn't think
it was a big deal in the first place...
...and then I was embarrassed.
- How do I say it without looking...?
- Guilty? Guilty?
I'm your wife, Derek. You're supposed
to trust me. You let this happen.
You think I encouraged this?
Don't give me that innocent bullshit.
I was there at your desk. I saw you.
I saw how you played games
and you played those girls...
...but you never did that to me.
Until now.
What is this? Is this about me
wanting to go to school?
God, Sharon, it is not like that.
This woman is sick, okay?
Nothing happened between...
Do I ever ask you for anything?
I don't ask you for anything.
All I asked you was to be honest.
- I told you the truth!
- No.
- I did.
- No, you didn't.
- I told you the truth.
- No, you didn't. You lied.
We made a vow
on our wedding day...
...that we would tell each other
everything.
No matter how ugly
or uncomfortable it might be.
I specifically asked you,
"Did anything happen at that party?"
And what did you tell me?
- You said no.
- I know.
- I don't know what to believe right now.
- Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
I think I need to be alone.
I think I need to be alone.
Stop, stop, stop. Okay?
Come on. Sharon. Please?
- Sharon, come on.
- Get out of my house!
This is crazy, Sharon!
Don't you see what's happening?
Get out of my house.
Nothing happened with this...
Okay. You know what?
You just tell me what you want me
to do and that's what I'll do!
Well, first, I suggest you pack
your toothbrush.
Then I want you to get your socks,
your shaving kit, your underwear...
...your prophylactics, if
you need them, and get out!
- And go where, Sharon?
- To hell.
But until then,
I suggest maybe the Four Seasons.
Sharon!
Miss Sheridan?
Hey, I'm Monica Reese.
I'm a detective assigned to your case.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.
They won't let me take a shower
or wash my hair.
Apparently I'm still on suicide watch.
So you feel like talking
about the other night?
Have you spoken to Derek?
Yeah.
And he's all right?
Relatively speaking.
When can I see him?
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna be possible.
- Why?
- Miss, I don't mean to upset you...
...but I don't think Mr. Charles
wants to speak to you...
...or continue any kind of contact.
Then why did he send me these?
He sent you flowers?
Lilies. My favourite.
Beautiful.
Yeah.
Miss Sheridan, could you tell me
what happened at the hotel?
- Why you were there?
- Didn't Derek tell you?
Yeah, but I'd really like
to get your version.
Well, there's not much to tell.
He asked me to meet him
at the hotel.
And you agreed?
Of course.
And then what happened?
I think you can guess what we did.
Yeah. You... You slept together.
Yes.
Well, Derek denies it, so...
He's just trying to protect me.
He's being a gentleman.
Right.
The next day, he told me that his wife
wouldn't give him a divorce.
You know the kind of woman
that will never let go?
Yeah.
Then he said
that we couldn't see each other.
I overreacted.
I didn't realise at the time
that he was just being noble.
Noble? What do you mean, "noble"?
He was thinking about his little boy,
Kyle.
What the break-up would do to him.
Lisa. Can I call you Lisa?
Yeah.
How would you, you know...
...characterise your relationship
with Derek?
- Lovers.
- Yeah, I got that.
But I mean, do you really believe
he's in love with you?
I'm not a home wrecker.
Monica, I'm not stealing him away.
Their marriage is over.
I do feel bad about his wife, though.
Well, how so?
Well, it can't be easy...
...to find out that your husband's
in love with someone else.
Right.
I just hope that she doesn't do
something stupid.
I don't have to tell you the impact
this could have.
- Even a whiff of impropriety.
- Impropriety. There is no impropriety!
This is just a sick fantasy
from a very disturbed girl.
Who might retaliate
with a sexual harassment lawsuit.
I was the one
who was sexually harassed.
I can't believe this is happening
to me. This is like a nightmare.
By now you're probably wishing
you had banged her.
Goddamn it, Joe!
Derek, calm down. I believe you,
and I'll back you all the way on this.
If we find out
there was something going on...
That's not gonna happen.
There's nothing.
Good. Then you've got nothing
to worry about.
- I'm putting Ben on the Ganz account.
- No. Ganz is my client...
- Look...
- No, Joe.
I'm not losing my client over this.
Take a little time off, just until
this blows over. Focus on Sharon.
Oh, Jesus.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Derek, there's a Detective Reese here
to see you.
<i>Com</i>e <i>on.</i>
<i>You think I s</i>e<i>nt h</i>e<i>r flow</i>e<i>rs?</i>
My assistant has all my personal
information in his computer.
She must have accessed them
when she temped for me.
This is Lisa's journal.
It's a sort of diary, I guess...
...that she was keeping.
- Okay.
It's a rather graphic
and detailed account...
...of your various sexual liaisons
together.
- My what?
- I have to warn you, it's...
"We..."
This is bullshit.
None of this happened.
I've never been to her apartment.
I've never touched her.
Well, according to these entries,
you are quite the accomplished lover.
Oh, and apparently,
you made some promises to her.
Promises to divorce your wife and...
Okay, detective.
You seem smart.
You can't possibly believe that.
Look, the only thing that matters
is that she believes this.
So there has to be something I can do
to protect myself, right? My family?
Sure.
You could file a restraining order.
Let's do that.
- But that might not be necessary.
- Why not?
Because Lisa's sister flew down
from San Francisco...
...and took Lisa back with her
earlier today.
I can't say I'm unhappy to hear that.
Maybe now she'll get the help
that she needs.
You ready? Let's go for it.
- Hey.
- Kyle. Hey, baby.
It's my birthday next week.
Happy birthday.
Sharon, are you gonna make me
spend my birthday alone?
Have dinner with me?
Come on, Sharon.
Move your foot, Derek.
What do you think?
Be honest.
Derek, your menu. Your menu.
- Oh, my menu, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
Sharon, this means a lot to me.
I missed you.
And, I don't know, there's just so much
I wanna tell you.
It's your party, birthday boy.
You look beautiful.
I love you.
Sharon, I just wanna be home.
Okay, it's been three months.
And I'll do whatever it takes to fix this,
to make us work again...
...your studies, you and Kyle,
I mean...
...you name it, I'll do it.
I got you something.
- Should I just...?
- No.
Let's see how
the rest of the evening goes.
<i>And w</i>e<i>lcom</i>e <i>to "Fact or Fiction."</i>
<i>I'm your host, Rod Bak</i> e<i>r.</i>
<i>And on today's show, l</i>e<i>t's w</i>e<i>lcom</i>e
<i>back our champion, Bunny!</i>
Hi. I'm Sharon's friend, Kate.
You're...?
Samantha. Mrs. Charles is at dinner.
Sharon told me to drop by.
I have this present for Kyle.
I'm just gonna run it up to him.
Oh, you can't, he's sleeping.
I won't wake him.
Maybe you should come back
another time.
But I'm here now.
I...
I get it, you're just doing your job.
Good.
Do you need me to call Sharon?
Yeah.
Okay.
Sharon. Hey, it's Kate.
Where am I? I'm at your house,
of course. You told me to drop by.
She forgot.
No, Samantha just wanted me
to give you a call.
She was a little bit concerned.
No. No, no, no.
Don't be upset with her.
No, God, come on,
she was just doing her job.
Great. All right, have an
amazing dinner. Tell Derek I said hi.
Oh, Sharon, hold on.
Do you need to talk to her?
No, no, I'm fine.
All right, I'll catch up with you
in the morning. Bye, honey.
I'll be back in a sec.
Yeah.
Sharon, you know,
I miss you and I love you...
...and I know that you miss me too.
I do miss you, but I don't know
if that's enough.
We're not talking about divorce,
right?
I don't come from a family of divorce.
Mom and Dad'll be celebrating their
30th anniversary in three months.
I look at them and I wonder
if that can ever be us.
It is us. It can be us, will be us.
I need you to understand
that nothing happened with that girl.
I know I should've been honest
with you from the beginning...
...and I wasn't.
And that will never happen again.
But I love you.
I mean, I love you with all my heart,
and I love my son too.
I guess Kyle does miss his daddy.
Does Sharon... miss Daddy?
I will do anything, anything.
- Anything?
- You name it.
Oh, I guess the evening's
going good.
What about the Benz?
- The Benz.
- My Benz?
I just... Oh, yes.
I got that key right here.
You know, it's...
Missed you.
See you later!
You too!
Okay, it works, it works.
Welcome home, baby.
You driving my car.
- You guys got back so fast.
- Hey.
Any trouble with Kyle?
No, he was a doll.
But you just missed your friend.
- What friend?
- You know, your friend Kate?
I don't know a Kate.
She was here.
She had something for Kyle.
Oh, my God! Where's Kyle?
- His crib.
- Somebody was inside the house?
- Yeah.
- How long were they here for?
Just a few minutes. What's wrong?
You said it was okay!
Kyle?
She took my baby.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What happened? Tell me.
She said she had something for Kyle
and then she left.
She left? Kyle's not in his room!
Call 911! Now!
Kyle?
Kyle?
Kyle? Son?
Kyle!
Oh, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
Kyle, oh.
She couldn't have got far.
She couldn't have got far.
We'll wait for the blood work.
It appears he's fine.
I don't see any reason
why you can't take him home.
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.
Hey.
How's he doing?
Doctor says he's fine.
Well, I'm not fine.
She was in our house.
And now our son
is in a hospital bed.
You said she was in San Francisco.
Why is she back?
And how did she even know
we'd be out?
Obviously she was watching
your house.
We need you to find her.
I will do everything in my power
to find her.
One of you better do something
about this woman.
Or I will.
So, what am I supposed to do now?
- Buy a gun?
- Please.
We'll have our unit tracking her.
In the meantime, you better beef up
your security system.
She could have hurt my son.
My son.
Okay. You don't wanna go to sleep?
- Kyle. It's okay, baby.
- It's okay.
Oh, no.
Oh, no. God.
Jesus.
This psycho.
She never left.
Yeah, I need to speak
to Detective Reese immediately.
My name, Derek Charles.
Yeah, she knows me.
This is an emergency.
I need to speak to her.
<i>Hi, it's Lisa, sorry you miss</i>e<i>d m</i>e.
<i>L</i>e<i>av</i>e <i>m</i>e <i>a m</i>e<i>ssag</i>e <i>aft</i>e<i>r th</i>e <i>b</i>ee<i>p.</i>
You listen to me.
You know exactly who this is.
You came into my house,
you touched my child...
...and you think you're crazy?
I'll show you crazy.
Just try me, bitch!
You're set. You ready for me
to show you how the system works?
Definitely.
Simple.
You just punch in your code,
now it's armed.
Case of an emergency,
this is the panic button.
You touch this,
the police are knocking at your door.
There's also one in your master.
Okay, so you packed everything?
What time you taking off?
This afternoon after I pick Kyle up
from my sister's.
- Okay, well, drive safely.
- Okay.
- I'll be there in the morning.
- All right.
- Set the alarm.
- You don't have to tell me.
- I love you.
- Love you too.
Bye.
Derek Charles's office.
<i>Patrick.</i>
Lisa? Oh, my God, it's been forever.
What, like six months?
<i>I know. W</i>e<i>'v</i>e <i>got a lot of gossip</i>
<i>to catch up on.</i>
Well, I'm not supposed to talk to you.
I could get fired.
<i>Trust m</i>e<i>, you'r</i>e <i>not g</i>e<i>tting fir</i>e<i>d.</i>
What do you mean?
<i>D</i>e<i>r</i>e<i>k didn't t</i>e<i>ll you.</i>
Tell me what?
<i>H</i>e<i>'s l</i>e<i>aving Sharon.</i>
<i>Th</i>e<i>y'r</i>e <i>g</i>e<i>tting a div orc</i>e.
- A divorce?
- <i>Lik</i> e <i>that's a surpris</i>e.
Look, that's not gonna happen, Lisa.
<i>Patrick, com</i>e <i>on.</i>
<i>I know what I'm talking about.</i>
Then why are they driving to San
Diego for her parents' anniversary?
<i>D</i>e<i>r</i>e<i>k's not going.</i>
Yeah, actually, he is.
Sharon's leaving this afternoon,
Derek's driving down in the morning.
Lisa? Did you hear me?
<i>Patrick, I hav</i>e <i>to go.</i>
No, you just called.
My purse.
Joe needs these by 5.
- Yeah. Sharon's on one.
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, baby, I just left the house.
- Okay, good. You set the alarm?
- The ala...
Oh, God, I forgot.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get out soon.
I'll do it.
No. I'm just down the hill. I'll swing
back around, and I'll call you after.
Hey. Call me back.
Did you not get my message?
I'm so sorry. We didn't want you
to find out this way.
I knew it would come to this.
I know how hard it must be to have
someone fall out of love with you.
I know.
You are completely delusional.
I'm gonna have the cops
deal with your crazy ass.
- Wait, it doesn't...
- Don't touch me.
- We can talk.
- I told you, don't touch me!
Crazy!
Get off of me!

Sharon?
Derek, I'm gonna call you back.
I need to speak to Detective
Reese, right now, please.
Yeah. No, it's an emergency.
Come here, bitch.
I'm gonna wipe the floor
with your little skinny ass.
Oh, you want to hold on?
You screaming now, huh?
Come here!
Didn't I tell you not
to come to my house?
Nobody touches my child.
Come on. Come here!
Come on, this what you want?
Come on.
Come a little closer.
You almost got it, come on.
Come on.
You want some of me?
You almost got me.
Come on, bitch.
Take my hand.
Come on, take my hand.
I got you.
Come on, come on.
Crazy bitch.
Get off of me.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Sharon? You all right?
What happened here?
I think you know what happened.
Stay here.
- Oh, baby.
- You okay?
- It's over.
- It's over.
