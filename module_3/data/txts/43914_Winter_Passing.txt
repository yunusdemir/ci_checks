<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Yeah!
<i>[Woman] There are certain hours of the night</i>
<i>when I awake to the sound of a train.
<i>It roars right through my apartment.
<i>At times it feels as if</i>
<i>it will lift me out ofbed.
<i>All that earsplitting thunder</i>
<i>and then silence.
- I'm alone, Exley<i>!</i>
- <i>[Man] I'm gonna stop you.
Would you mind singing?
- Like a song?
- <i>Yeah, like a song.
But l- I didn't prepare that<i>!
- That's okay<i>!</i>Just go for it<i>!</i>
- Like any song?
<i>Anything you like.
Whenever you're ready<i>!

Thanks<i>!
Take care<i>!
You too<i>!
Thank you<i>!
<i>Methinks there is</i>
<i>an air comes from her.
What fine chisel<i>!!!
Could ever yet cut breath?
Let no man mock me<i>!!!
For I will kiss her<i>!
[Gasps]
Oh, she's warm<i>!
If this be magic<i>!!!
Let it be an art lawful as eating<i>!
Yeah, we just got done<i>!</i>Just now<i>!
I'm in the dressing room<i>!</i>
No, my stomach's been fucked up all day<i>!
<i>Valuables! See you tomorrow.
Hold on<i>!</i> I know we're winding down,
but the snow was clumpy again tonight<i>!
- Oh, I'm sorry<i>!</i> I'll get it fixed<i>!</i>

<i>I think I'm gonna head home.</i>

<i>[Woman] Sorry these are late, everyone.</i>
<i>Payroll had a computer glitch.
Reese, there's a woman out there
asking for you<i>!
She said she'd wait by the stage door<i>!</i>
Very classy looking<i>!
- Thanks, Ruthie<i>!</i>
- Thanks, Ruth<i>!
- <i>Reese?</i>
- Yeah<i>!
- Hi<i>!</i> Lori Lansky<i>!</i> It was a great show<i>!</i>
- Thanks<i>!
<i>The ending is so moving.</i>
<i>And that thief-he was just mesmerizing.
- Glad you liked it<i>!</i>
- Hey<i>!
Hey<i>!</i> Hey, Ray, this is Lori<i>!
- Hey, Lori<i>!</i>
- Hi, Ray<i>!</i> It was a great show<i>!
- Thank you<i>!</i>
- Thanks<i>!</i> You're going to Niagara, right?
- Mm-hmm<i>!</i>
- Cool<i>!</i> See you there<i>!
- Later<i>!</i>
- Bye, Ray<i>!
There goes our thief<i>!
So, can I buy you a drink?
- Um, who are you?
- I'm a book editor<i>!
I, um, have to go meet our thief<i>!
Well, can I join you?
It's this way<i>!
Is this about my dad?
Sort of, yes<i>!
- What's up?
- Not much<i>!
- Staying out of trouble?
- Trying to<i>!
- I'll get this<i>!</i>
- That's okay<i>!</i> It's on the house<i>!
- Oh, thanks<i>!</i>
- Cheers<i>!
So, about your father<i>!
You want to know about
the, um, hidden manuscripts<i>!!!
What he puts in his Cherry Coke<i>!!!
If he finger fucks his pen pals<i>!
All the deep, dark, spooky shit?
Oh, I can see the wolves
have already gotten to you<i>!
- You people are relentless<i>!</i>
- He hasn't shared his work in almost two decades<i>!
- Trust me-you're not missing out on much<i>!</i>
- Apparently there's a novel<i>!
- I doubt it<i>!</i>
- The first two chapters were sent to his publishers<i>!
Yeah, seven fucking years ago<i>!</i>
It was 37 pages of crap<i>!
There were so many spelling errors<i>!!!
His editor thought he was trying to
capture the voice of an illiterate<i>!
Well, I like to think that he's
working on his masterpiece<i>!
Anyway, I'm not here about the novel<i>!
Early in your parents' relationship<i>!!!
There was a three-year
letter-writing correspondence<i>!
<i>Apparently</i>-
<i>and I'm sure that you know this</i>-
your father fancied himself as
a rather angry American expatriate<i>!
For most of their courtship,
he was living in the south of France<i>!
Now, if I have my chronology correct<i>!!!
Your father was writing
the early chapters of <i>People's Park...
and your mother was completing
her degree here in the States<i>!
At some point
before your mother's death<i>!!!
<i>Your father returned</i>
<i>her letters to her.
- <i>Your mother arranged them in a box.</i>
- And?
And left the whole collection to you<i>!
And this is one of the letters?
<i>It's a xerox of one</i>
<i>of the early ones, yes.
There are approximately 150 pairs<i>!
- How'd you get the xerox?
- Your mother's brother<i>!
- Uncle Dick?
- Richard was the executor of your mother's will<i>!
- How'd you find him?
- I attended the funeral<i>!
- <i>I was hoping to meet you there.</i>
- I was opening a show<i>!
Of course<i>!
<i>Hey, Spicer's in the turtle shed.
What?
Excuse me for a second<i>!
[Snorting]
Oh, God<i>!
[Laughs]
[Grunts]
[Grunts]
- <i>dd[Hip-hop]</i>
- <i>dd[Man Rapping]
So, you want the letters<i>!
- I'd like to buy them from you, yes<i>!</i>
- What's your offer?
$100,000-
half on delivery of the letters<i>!!!
And, uh, half on publication<i>!
L-I would be very happy
to recommend a literary agent to you<i>!
How gracious<i>!
- Reese, do you and your father speak?
- Doesn't matter<i>!
Why not?
'Cause I'm not gonna do it<i>!
Wait a minute<i>!</i> Look, just-just
think about it, would you?
If you change your mind, call me<i>!</i>
My home number's on the back of the card<i>!
Just think about it<i>!
Please leave<i>!

<i>Reese.
- Rob<i>!</i>
- Hey<i>!
Hey<i>!
- So, what's up?
- Not much<i>!
Same old shit-
auditioning, working<i>!!!
Watching my laundry multiply<i>!
What are you doing downtown?
I'm, uh, house-sitting
over at this loft on Bond Street<i>!
Sort of semipermanent couch surfing<i>!
I heard you're in a show<i>!
Yeah<i>! Winter's Tale.
Over at La Mama<i>!
We close this weekend<i>!
You working on anything?
I was doing this weird Molière workshop
set in a boxing ring<i>!
That ended a few weeks ago<i>!
I was actually thinking
about moving to Colorado<i>!!!
Working on a ranch or something<i>!
Real people, cows and shit<i>!
Hey, I heard about your mom<i>!</i>
I'm really sorry about that<i>!
Oh, thanks<i>!
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine<i>!
If you ever feel like talking me out
of moving to Colorado<i>!!!
Give me a call<i>!
Uh-
I still got this stupid thing<i>!
Minutes galore<i>!
See you around<i>!
Fifteen years ago<i>!!!
I thought he was the funniest,
sexiest, smartest person I'd ever met<i>!
And now the idea of even being in the same
room with him makes me physically ill<i>!
What time does to people<i>!
I'm just glad we never had kids<i>!
Are you okay?
Yeah<i>!</i> Why?
I don't know<i>!</i>
You just seem so far away<i>!
You've hardly touched your salad<i>!
I think I'm just a little run-down<i>!
The show closing,
what's next and all that<i>!
You can tell me stuff, you know<i>!
I'd hate to have our little
mutual admiration society disband<i>!!!
Just because the play is closing<i>!
What about your family?
Will you see them for the holidays?
- No<i>!</i>
- Where are your parents anyway?
I've never heard you talk about them<i>!
- Not much to talk about<i>!</i>
- It's like that, huh?
If you'd like to spend Thanksgiving with me,
you're more than welcome<i>!
I'm having some friends over for dinner<i>!
We're doin' a turkey and pumpkin pie
and homemade stuffing<i>!
And I got my grandma's
stuffing recipe with apples<i>!
- Thanks, Didi<i>!</i>
- What happened to your hand?
Oh, I banged it while I was feeding Spike<i>!</i>
It's just a bruise<i>!
How is Spike anyway?
Is she still keeping you up at night?
She's good<i>!
It's so sweet-you saving that kitten<i>!</i>
[Chuckles]
I couldn't do it, not in this city<i>!
What?
Hmm<i>!</i> There's no pay phone<i>!
- You can use my cell<i>!</i>
- Are you sure?
Of course<i>!

<i>Feed her in the morning.

- <i>Reese.

<i>[Door Closes]
<i>[Woman On Phone] Hi, Reese.</i>
<i>This is Dr. Barrett from St. Mark's Veterinary.
<i>I'm sorry to have to tell you</i>
<i>that Spike's test results...
<i>yielded positive for feline leukemia.
- <i>Please give me a call</i>
<i>at your earliest convenience...</i>
- [Grunting]
<i>So that we can discuss her options.

- So, I got your message<i>!</i>
- <i>[Man] Hey, Reese. Can I get a beer here?
I'll need money to get home<i>!
- We'll be glad to arrange a flight for you<i>!</i>
- Oh, I don't fly<i>!
Okay<i>!
And I'll, uh, need cash<i>!
Uh, I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to arrange cash, Reese<i>!
<i>I'd have to talk to my boss, put through a</i>
<i>check request. It could take a couple of weeks.
- Then fuck it<i>!</i>
- Well, wait a minute<i>!
[Male Voice On Game]
There's two<i>!
You got all three<i>!
- <i>Will you be renting a car?</i>
- I'll take the bus<i>!
<i>And I'll need money for cigarettes.
<i>And food.
A girl's gotta eat, right?
<i>[Cash Register Bell Dings]
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Take it easy.
Well, that's that<i>!
Can you tell me when you plan
on heading to Michigan?
<i>I'll leave in a few days.
- <i>So, uh, how can I get in touch with you?</i>

If you need me to write you a check

- How was the funeral?
- Pretty low-key<i>!
Fair amount of her fans showed up<i>!
No Pin the Tail on the Donkey
or anything like that<i>!
- Where is she buried anyway?
- They cremated her<i>!
Your Uncle Dick took her ashes
back to Louisville<i>!
So that guy in the house said
you were living in here now<i>!
<i>Yeah. Pretty easy.</i>
<i>I got my books and my bed, my worktable.
Got this- Got a new stove here<i>!
Are you writing?
A little here and there<i>!

- [English Accent] Hello<i>!

- Reese just arrived from New York<i>!
Well, it's such a surprise<i>!
- Here you are<i>!</i>
- Mmm<i>!</i> Good<i>!</i> Thank you<i>!

<i>Probably the transmission.</i>
<i>Have Corbit take a look at it.
Well, I should go put this stuff

- Nice to finally meet you, Reese<i>!</i>
- Bye<i>!
- Bye<i>!</i>
- <i>[Liquor Pouring]

<i>Corbit, I understand you've</i>
<i>already met my daughter.
<i>She'll be staying with us...

- In the house?
- In her old bedroom<i>!</i> Yeah<i>!
What about Shelly?
She'll be okay
on the sofa for a while<i>!
- The upstairs study's open<i>!</i>
- I don't want anybody in there<i>!
I'm sure Shelly won't mind<i>!
Right on<i>!
<i>Uh, Shelly told me</i>
<i>to tell you that dinner...
will be served promptly at 6:30<i>!!!
<i>And if Reese doesn't like chicken...
<i>there's meat loaf and twice-baked potatoes</i>

When I was still living in the house,
I came downstairs<i>!!!
He was sleeping on the sofa<i>!
Well<i>!!!
It sounds like you got yourself
a little utopia here<i>!

<i>Um, the hot water isn't working.

- Okay<i>!
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>It's pretty cool-plumbing.
Well<i>!!!
Enjoy your shower<i>!

Sorry<i>!
Ow! Shit<i>!
Run cold water over it<i>!
If you've come down to help, I'm grateful,
but I think I have everything under control<i>!

on the little golf game that's going on upstairs<i>!
- Don hits a bucket of golf balls
every night before dinner<i>!</i>

<i>[Wind Howling]
- Corbit, would you like to say grace?

Since when does anyone in this house say grace?

- <i>Wow.

<i>That Christmas was a Republican</i>
<i>capitalistic conspiracy...

Thank you for the food<i>!!!
<i>And the company.

<i>It's nice to have her here.
<i>And thank you for a nice home.

You want some?

<i>Mmm. Shelly,</i>
<i>your breasts are delicious.
Glad you like it, Corbit<i>!
<i>So, how were the links?
Mmm<i>!
<i>He was really whackin' 'em today.
<i>We need to get a new driver though.</i>
<i>Also would like to get a four wood.

- Is that something you can sort out?
We can just order one

<i>Great.
<i>Don?
You've hardly touched your plate<i>!
<i>Corbit, did you get a chance</i>
<i>to look at the car?

I'll replace it tomorrow<i>!
Corbit here's quite the mechanic<i>!
<i>He used to repair speedboats.</i>
<i>Right, Corbit?
Mmm<i>!</i>
Evinrude Outboard Motors, actually<i>!
<i>And he's a musician too.</i>
<i>What are you working on now, Corbit?
Just some new stuff<i>!
<i>He used to be in a Christian rock band</i>
<i>down in Flint.
- What did you call yourselves?
- Punching Pilate<i>!
<i>L- I had to leave the band though</i>
<i>'cause they were trying to get all ska.
So<i>!!!</i> I left 'em<i>!

<i>You want to listen to some music?

Yes, thank you<i>!</i> I know<i>!</i>
I lived here for 18 years<i>!
- By the way, what happened to my comforter?
- I'm washing it<i>!
<i>You're quite the reader.
<i>Yeah, well, when you grow up in a house full</i>

<i>Their work was so different.

<i>She wrote about upper-middle-class</i>
<i>American executive types...
stranded in post-I<i>!</i>B<i>!</i>M<i>!</i> Poughkeepsie<i>!
I would say your mum wrote
her fair share of literary nightmares<i>!
<i>I actually think she wrote pseudo-literary</i>
<i>love stories disguised as social satire.
Well, obviously you would know
better than I do<i>!
I mean, I've read everything
by both of them, but<i>!!!
I wasn't around
when it was happening<i>!
But you are now<i>!
I am<i>!
And I've never seen someone
agonize over each sentence<i>!!!
The way he does<i>!
<i>And it's funny.
As a teacher, he was always preaching
compositional velocity<i>!!!
And boring your fingers into the keyboard
as though fiction is some kind of sport<i>!
<i>And now,</i>
<i>getting a paragraph out ofhim...
is like pulling a piano out of a pond<i>!
Would he ever show you his stuff?
I've had to buy every book he's written<i>!
Must have been an interesting childhood<i>!
Yeah<i>!
Competing for attention with
twin No<i>!</i> 3 Underwood typewriters<i>!!!
Won't do much for your self-esteem<i>!

My name is Dean Gerald<i>!
I've been camping

I was told this is where
the novelist Don Holden lives<i>!
Are you, like, one of

I am currently in the M<i>!</i>F<i>!</i>A<i>!</i>
Writing program at Iowa<i>!
Mr<i>!</i> Holden was a visiting lecturer there
a few years ago<i>!
I wasn't there yet,
but<i>!!!</i> I, like, heard about it<i>!
So you've never actually met him?
- I'm basically just a fan<i>!</i>
- Excuse me, Reese!
What the fuck, dude?
Get off!<i>!
That's a $500 camera, man!
No cameras on the premises, mister<i>!</i>
Photographs are not allowed<i>!
- Okay<i>!</i>
- Mr<i>!</i> Holden has- has recently expired<i>!
- <i>Expired?</i>
- That's right- expired<i>!
- He died?
- He's officially concluded
all of his earthly business<i>!
And he's no longer around
to talk about it<i>!!!
So please remove yourself from the premises
or I'll be forced to seize your person<i>!
- <i>Is that understood?</i>
- Totally understood<i>!
<i>And I know karate.</i>
<i>I've amassed several belts.
<i>Okay, I'm removing myself.
But, hey, if, um, Mr<i>!</i> Holden<i>!!!
<i>Ever decides to revive himself...
<i>and officially resumes</i>
<i>his earthly business...
Would you give this to him?
It's<i>!!!</i> a harmless fan letter<i>!
Well, if there is ever
an official revival<i>!!!
I'll make sure Mr<i>!</i> Holden
gets this letter<i>!

<i>Could you please stop</i>
<i>calling him "Don"in front of me?
It makes me imagine him at some weird
swingers' beach wearing a Speedo<i>!
Don insists that his students
call him by his first name<i>!
How egalitarian<i>!
<i>All you're gonna find in that one</i>
<i>are royalty statements and tax documents.
Why does the idea of you being
his little attaché make my skin crawl?
I'm not the one lurking around<i>!
I'm not lurking, Shelly<i>!</i>
This is my house<i>!
<i>I know, Reese.
You grew up here<i>!
You suffered all the calamities
of being a daughter<i>!!!
Of two self-indulgent,

And then you ran away
and never looked back<i>!
Oh, is that what he told you?
That I ran away and I never looked back?
- He didn't tell me anything<i>!</i>
- <i>Don't you have your own family to psychoanalyze?
For some reason
I imagine you as an only child<i>!!!
Growing up in some vast,
impenetrable mansion with turrets<i>!!!
Daddy modeling perpetual tennis wear,
Mum playing badminton<i>!!!
And having biscuits and tea
on the front lawn<i>!
<i>Why don't you go back to Narnia or wherever</i>
<i>the fuck you're from and leave my dad alone?
<i>As it turns out, Reese...
I am an only child<i>!!!
And my <i>Daddy</i> did play a bit of tennis<i>!!!
And me mum rather fancied
her biscuits and tea at 4:00 p<i>!</i>m<i>!!!!
Every day after a rather bracing
game of croquet<i>!
<i>But, if you must know...
I grew up in a two-bedroom council flat
in Shepherd's Bush<i>!!!
And, although it's really none of your
fucking business, my parents are dead<i>!
<i>When you work out what it is</i>
<i>you're looking for, let me know.
I might be able to help you<i>!
- [Sighs]
- [Pills Rattling]
<i>[Hammering]
- What you doing?
- Workin'<i>!
- What you doing?
- Workin'<i>!
What's this thing for anyway?
So Mr<i>!</i> Holden can get in the house
without having to walk outside<i>!
Did something happen, Corbit?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, this whole hiding-in-the-garage thing<i>!
- Did one of his stalkers
freak him out or something?
- Not that I know of<i>!
He just likes it better inside<i>!
Hey<i>!</i> Do you know anything about these?
Oh, those are Shelly's<i>!
- Is she sick?
- I think she was<i>!
But she doesn't really talk about it<i>!
Hey, so do you want to
hang out after dinner?
Sure<i>!
Right on<i>!
Hey, Reese?
I'm not really an officer of the law
or anything<i>!!!
But, uh, I'm pretty sure it's illegal<i>!!!
To take someone else's
prescription medication<i>!

Hey<i>!
- Hi, Reese<i>!</i>
- What you doin'?
I'm just wakin' up<i>!
[Whispers]
Jesus<i>!
Are you okay?
[Sighs]
Yeah, I'm fine<i>!</i> l-
Just a dizzy spell<i>!
Would you hand me my bourbon, please?
Yeah<i>!
Ooh<i>!
So, what are your plans today?
I don't know<i>!
- Thought I might go to the lake<i>!</i>
- Well, be sure to layer<i>!
- Daddy<i>!</i>
- Hmm<i>!
Did Mom leave anything for me?
Regarding any money from her estate,
I'm sure a lawyer will be in touch<i>!
No, I mean, besides money<i>!</i>
Was there anything else?
Your Uncle Dick mailed that box
a couple of months ago<i>!
Haven't gone through it, but feel free<i>!
<i>[Typing]
What's in there?
Just some old junk<i>!
So, Corbit said that Shelly's
had some medical problems<i>!
Yeah, she was in pretty rough shape
there for a while<i>!
What was wrong with her?
She had endometriosis<i>!
<i>The doctors tried a lot of things.
Nothing really worked,
so she had to have a hysterectomy<i>!
- Jesus<i>!</i>
- Yeah, I was all she had there for a while<i>!
She's a good kid, Reese<i>!
You oughta give her a chance<i>!
- Thanks<i>!</i>
- There's a plate for you in the oven<i>!
<i>Reese, are we still on for later?
Is something wrong?
What room did she do it in?
<i>I don't think this is the time or the place</i>
<i>for this conversation, Reese.
- What room?
- <i>Reese</i>-
Shut up, Shelly<i>!</i> What room was it?
<i>The basement? The bathroom? Tell me.
The study upstairs<i>!
In the middle of the night, I found her hangin'
on a coat hook on the back of the door<i>!
She used a necktie<i>!

- <i>Yeah.
I think she played it in a different key<i>!
It sounded nice<i>!
I'm gonna go do some work<i>!
Daddy-
Are you, like,
mad at me or something?
I guess I'm just a little disappointed<i>!
Why?
<i>I don't know, Reese. I th</i>-
I think it would have been nice
if you'd made it back for the funeral<i>!
<i>She wasn't perfect,</i>
<i>but she was your mother.
<i>Is that who she was?
My mother?
The woman who treated me like a<i>!!!
Mild curiosity all my life?
- She suffered, Reese<i>!</i>
- <i>She suffered?
We all fucking suffered<i>!
This house was one big,
silent museum of suffering<i>!
We did our best<i>!
<i>Yeah, well, don't fault me</i>
<i>for being just a little disappointed.
Do you know how many times
you guys saw me act?
Once<i>!
<i>One fucking time in the seventh grade</i>
<i>when I played Wendy in</i> Peter Pan<i>!!!
And you had to nudge Mom awake
during the curtain call<i>!
<i>So I missed her funeral.
- Her fucking loss<i>!</i>
- Please don't swear<i>!

<i>In your mother's third letter...
<i>she talks about killing herself.
<i>How... drowning would be</i>
<i>too terrifying...
and a bullet to the head
would be too messy<i>!
<i>She was in St. "Looey"at the time,</i>
<i>working on her second novel.
<i>Your father replied...
that he would do anything she wished
to make that not happen<i>!
He said he would
get on a plane if he had to<i>!
<i>In her next letter she said</i>
<i>that she felt better...
and that her thoughts of suicide
had subsided<i>!!!
And that she had a new idea for a novel<i>!
<i>Can I borrow a cigarette?
Thank you<i>!
It's St<i>!</i> Louis<i>!
St<i>!</i> Louis<i>!
<i>The later letters...
particularly<i>!!!
77 through to 123<i>!!!
Are less passionate<i>!!!
And almost approach bitterness<i>!!!
Perhaps even jealousy<i>!
<i>And then by 130...
<i>they dissolve down</i>
<i>to two or three...
very uninformative half-sentences<i>!
And then they end<i>!
Are you going to publish them?
I honestly don't know, Shelly<i>!
Well, I hope it's worth it<i>!
<i>Thanks for the cigarette.
<i>Shelly, I found these under my bed.
Oh, thank you<i>!
<i>You know, Reese,</i>
<i>if it wasn't for your dad...
I don't know if I would have made it<i>!
In his own quiet way, he cares
a great deal about other people<i>!
I think he really
wants to get to know you<i>!
<i>It's probably gonna take some time.
Thanks for these<i>!
Daddy, are you okay?
Leave me alone<i>!
I thought maybe we could talk<i>!
Please go away<i>!
[Sobbing]
Shit<i>!
- You okay?
- Yeah<i>!
Can you- Can you make a fist?
- Yeah, like that<i>!</i>
- [Moans, Hisses]
- Does that hurt?
- A little bit<i>!
Hey, Corbit, I'm-
I'm really sorry about
what happened last night<i>!
Yeah, that was pretty weird<i>!
Hey, what happened to your eyeliner?
It was too Adam Ant<i>!
I thought it looked<i>!!!</i> cool<i>!
- Really?
- It looks really good on you<i>!
Made you look kinda like a wolverine<i>!
- Wolverine?
- Mm-hmm<i>!
- Wow<i>!</i>
- Yeah<i>!</i> Wolverines rock<i>!
Wolverines do rock<i>!
Hey, you know,
there's this bar in town<i>!!!
That has open mikes
on Wednesday nights<i>!
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, the Great Notch Inn<i>!
You should go in, play a song<i>!
Oh, man, I don't-
I don't know, Reese<i>!
Why not?
Um-
In front of anyone, l-
I have this thing that happens to me<i>!!!
When I have to play and sing
at the same time<i>!
What happens?
- I sort of freeze up<i>!</i>
- Mmm<i>!
If I'm alone, it's cool<i>!
And if I'm just playing
or just singing, it's okay too<i>!
But when I have to do both, it's bad<i>!
Well, what did you do when you
were in Punching Pilate?
I was pretty much
the designated rhythm guitarist<i>!
- Mmm<i>!</i>
- They had me go up to the front once,
but that was-
- That was a disaster<i>!</i>
- Well, what happened?
Let's just say I l- lost my shit<i>!
Excuse my French<i>!
I just froze up,
and they stopped the show<i>!
And then for some reason, l-
I kicked the drummer<i>!
He was this total
Black Sabbath wannabe and-
We got in this big fistfight,
and I broke his collarbone<i>!
So, they kicked me out of the band<i>!
It was a pretty big mess<i>!
I've never done
an open mike before, Reese<i>!
It- It would be pretty scary<i>!
I think you should just do it<i>!
I mean, you only live once, right?
I'm sure Shelly would come<i>!
- You think?
- I totally think<i>!
And I'll be there<i>!
Right on<i>!
Karate<i>!
"Kara-tay<i>!</i>"
"Kara-tay<i>!</i>"
It helps me relax<i>!
[Chuckles]
Wow<i>!
Yeah<i>!</i> You need not worry<i>!</i>
I'm a total pacifist<i>!
- Can I join you?
- Sure<i>!
How far do you usually go?
Uh, about two miles if I'm lucky<i>!
I think my jock days
are pretty much behind me<i>!
Do you wanna sprint
some telephone poles?
- Are you sure?
- Yeah<i>!</i> Feel okay<i>!
<i>Okay, but if I have a heart attack,</i>
<i>it's your fault.

in the U<i>!</i>P<i>!</i> about seven months now<i>!
All right<i>!</i> Well, welcome
to the Great Notch Inn<i>!!!
Where luck and love come
from the same hairy family<i>!
<i>Right, guys?
What song are you gonna
do for us tonight, Corbit?
"I Can't Tell You Why"
by the Beatle- by the Eagles<i>!
All right, that sounds great<i>!</i>
Let's give it up for Corbit<i>!
Testing<i>!

<i>His heart never actually stopped.
Fortunately,
the sleeping medication he took<i>!!!
Is designed to time release
in such a way<i>!!!
That<i>!!!</i> he never got
a potent enough dose<i>!!!
To execute the desired effect<i>!
Is he gonna be okay?
I don't anticipate any cognitive deficit<i>!
And his vital signs are all back to normal<i>!</i>
He has a strong heart<i>!
We're rehydrating his system

How long you been here?
Awhile<i>!
Do you need anything?
I'm thirsty<i>!
Okay<i>!
Thanks<i>!
Do you want some more?
No, but I'd love a cigarette<i>!
Yeah, me too<i>!!!
But we'll set off the alarms<i>!
What's that?
<i>That is, uh, your novel.
<i>I dug it up out of the backyard.
Corbit was supposed
to keep that under his hat<i>!
<i>How far are you into it?
I'm about halfway through<i>!
I think it's the first time I've seen anything
of yours in manuscript form<i>!
<i>The imperfections are really charming.
- I spell like a gorilla<i>!</i>
- <i>[Laughs]
- Do you hate it?
- No<i>!</i> I like it actually<i>!
It's really different
from your other stuff<i>!
- You're not bullshitting me?
- <i>No.
<i>Shelly thinks</i>
<i>it's borderline sentimental.
Do you think it's sentimental?
A little<i>!</i>
But it's a love story, right?
I guess<i>!
Think I'm getting soft?
Absolutely<i>!
- <i>Daddy.</i>
- Hmm?
About the stuff I said the other night-
I'm<i>!!!</i> really sorry<i>!</i> It wasn't fair<i>!
Well, we messed up pretty bad, Reese<i>!
No<i>!</i> You guys did the best you could<i>!
Like you said<i>!
What was she doing at home anyway?
I think she was lonely<i>!
We were both lonely<i>!
I just can't stop thinking about her<i>!
Come here<i>!
- Okay<i>!</i> Stop it now<i>!</i>
- [Sniffles] Okay<i>!
<i>How's Corbit?</i>
<i>He and Shelly okay?
