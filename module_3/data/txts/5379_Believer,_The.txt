Man: And it came to pass
after these things
that God tested Abraham,
and said to him,
"Abraham."
And Abraham said,
"Here I am."
And God said,
"Now take your son--
your only son
whom you love, Isaac,
and go unto
the land of Moriah
and offer him there
as a sacrifice
on a mountain
that I will show you."
So...
everyone, what's really
going on here?
Boy: It was a test
of Abraham's faith,
of his devotion to God.
Man: Danny, as usual,
you have something to add?
Danny: It's not about
Abraham's faith.
It's about God's power.
God says, "You know
how powerful I am? "
I can make you
do anything I want,
no matter how stupid--
even kill your own son,
because I'm everything
and you're nothing."
( train clattering )
- Hey, Ueshiva-bukah.
- What?
Get up!
Get the fuck up!
What the fuck
do you think this is?!
Do you think this is
a fucking test?!
You think God's going
to provide a fucking ram
instead of you? No!
Do me a favor...
why don't you
fucking hit me, okay?
Hit me.
Hit me!
Hit me, hit me, hit me.
Fucking hit me.
Hit me, please!
- You fucking kike!
- ( grunts )
Man on radio: It will no longer be
possible to say that the country
has a unified set
of core beliefs.
At that point we will cease
to be a nation
in the traditional sense,
and will become instead
a confederation of specific
interest groups
Iike medieval principalities.
And at the same time,
we will flow into the anonymous
undistinguished sea
of the global market.
The economic advantages of
this arrangement are obvious...
Man: Where I grew up
in South Boston,
when a kid would
walk down the street,
everybody knew his name.
He runs out in front of a car,
some old mick'll say,
"Jimmy Dunn, you get back on
that sidewalk and you stay there."
Then he graduates
high school,
he goes and sees his uncle
down at the gasworks
or a priest's brother
at the shipyards.
He gets
his apprentice papers.
Eight years later
he's making $1 6.50 an hour,
he's got four kids,
he's playing ball and going--
Man #2: Hey everybody.
Today, that kid
walks down the street,
it's filled with trash,
half the faces
are black,
shipyard's closed.
Only jobs left at the gasworks
are set-asides,
and by the time he drops out
of high school,
he'd rather get a job
at the Burger King.
So he drinks,
does crack, whatever.
When he hangs himself
on his front porch at 23,
the only people that'll mourn him
are a few of his buddies...
and his mom.
The soul of this country
is being destroyed.
And the only thing the present
government can offer us
is free trade,
mutual funds, and IPOs.
The average man is crushed
less by accumulated wealth
then by lack of leadership,
lack of community,
culture...
and the sense of emptiness
he cannot fill on his own.
That's why I'm a fascist.
It's the only
form of government
that can address
our fundamental needs.
What about race?
This isn't
the time for that.
I disagree.
I think race is central
to everything
we're talking about here.
Spiritual life comes from race,
from the blood.
Without that,
we're no better than the Jews.
What's wrong
with the Jews?
Carla.
Lookit, the point is the modern
world is a Jewish disease.
- All right?
- What disease?
Abstraction.
They're obsessed
with abstraction.
So what would
you propose, then?
Killing Jews.
That would be
a catastrophic mistake.
People hate Jews.
Do you agree?
They used to.
Today, that's not an issue.
No. No, no.
Deep down,
beneath all the tolerance
that they learn on television,
nothing's changed.
The very word
makes their skin crawl.
It's not even heat,
it's just--
it's like the way you feel when
a rat runs across the floor.
You want to step on it.
You just want to crush it.
You don't even know why.
It's a physical reaction,
and everyone feels it.
Jew.
So which ones
would you kill?
Barbara Streisand.
Kissinger.
- Man #3: Dershowitz.
- Roseanne!
We don't want celebrity
obscuring the issue.
Which is what?
At first, no one will know
why the victims are being killed.
You wouldn't announce it?
I'd say nothing,
and after about one or two,
people try to find a reason,
an answer.
And when it comes out,
the public will be outraged.
It will look like
Germany all over again.
Isn't that what we want?
Germany all over again?
Only done right this time.
And when people find out
that rich, successful,
brilliant Jews
are being killed,
they'll be glad.
And they won't say anything,
not even to themselves.
Once someone says it aloud,
they'll think, "That's exactly
what I was thinking."
And it'll all spread
from there.
It always does.
Man #4:
They're not gonna say nothing.
- ( muffled talking )
- Man #5: He's got a point.
You're not in school.
What do you do?
I drive a forklift...
over at the Big Boy
warehouse in Queens.
( clears throat )
Young man...
Lina Moebius.
And you are?
Daniel Balint.
Balint?
It's German.
Are you with the FBI,
Mr. Balint,
or any other
law enforcement agency?
I was about to ask you
the same thing.
So...
what are you really
after, Daniel?
Hmm?
Do you want
to just kill Jews,
or do you have
something larger in mind?
Curtis thinks your ideas
would marginalize us.
Curtis,
we're already marginal.
That's our appeal.
We're saying what no one else
has the guts to say.
Who would you kill first?
Ilio Manzetti.
Former ambassador to France,
managing partner
at Damon & Schwarzchild.
It's an investment
banking house.
- He's Jewish, Manzetti?
- Totally.
His parents immigrated
from Bulgaria when he was 1 1.
How would you do this?
I need some time to assess
his routines and his security,
but ideally?
On a New Uork City street,
midday,
with a small caliber automatic
without a silencer.
Why no silencer?
'Cause you want it
to be an event.
Why don't you come
visit us in the country?
We have a retreat.
You might find it interesting.
Bring your friends
if you like.
He reminds me of Karl
when I first met him.
I thought we agreed.
Anti-Semitism is exactly what
we're trying to leave behind.
Killing Manzetti.
Did you see
how they reacted to him?
Ues, of course, in this room,
where people aren't embarrassed
to call themselves Nazis.
It's a romantic movement,
Curtis, it always has been.
- Lina--
- Look,
I don't care about the Jews
one way or another,
but it has a power.
A thousand-year Reich
barely lasted a decade.
You really want to go down
that road again?
In America of all places?
Order and discipline aren't
exactly the national virtues.
He's very bright.
He speaks well.
So what do we do with him?
Man: Bring his friends?
We're not his friends.
Man #2: Hey Danny,
you fuck the girl yet?
- Man #3: He liked her mom.
- Her mom?
- ( car horn honks )
- That was her mother?
( honking continues )
Fuck you!
( honking continuing )
You, get the fuck
out of the way!
Fucking niggers!
Why don't you go back to Rwanda
and give each other AIDS?!
- Let's go, motherfucker.
- Come on, you fat bitch.
( humming
"My Darling Clementine" )
Man #1 :
What, you like it in here?
Man #2: Shut the fuck up.
You ever read "Mein Kampf"?
Hitler had some
of his best ideas in prison.
Guard: Daniel Balint.
- ( man whimpering )
- Man: Hey, shut the hell up.
I'm not going anywhere
without them.
Can I use a credit card?
Be quiet. I don't want
to wake up my mother.
( Daniel speaking Latin )
( speaks Latin )
"And the words fell apart
in my mouth
Iike moldering mushrooms."
A lot of these
are in Spanish.
Ueah, my grandmother's
from Argentina.
My father's family
went over during the war.
Where's your father now?
He's in a mental institution.
Is he a Nazi?
I don't know.
We don't talk about that.
I don't think he cares
about all that stuff...
- anymore.
- What's he care about?
Killing himself.
You think people ever commit
suicide out of happiness?
That's stupid. Why would they
do it if they were happy?
You're not like
the others, are you?
Like your friends.
Ues, I am.
Basically I am.
Hurt me.
Just do it.
Hurt me.
Ow! Not that hard!
Get up.
You have to go.
- What?
- ( slaps )
Lina: Curtis...
bring the paper.
( Spanish dance music playing )
- Hey, man.
- Punk-ass.
Woman: Where'd you have it
last, Dad? Try to remember.
Who's that?
Stay back, stay back.
Man: "And offer him there
as a sacrifice
on a mountain
that I will show you."
Everyone, what's really
going on here? Schlomo?
It was a test of Abraham's faith,
of his devotion to God.
- Very good.
- Isaac wasn't his only son.
- Ishmael was his son, too.
- The only son he loved.
Oh, they only kill them
when they love them.
Danny, as usual,
you have something to add?
It's not about Abraham's faith.
It's about God's power.
God says,
"You know how powerful I am?
I can make you do
anything I want,
no matter how stupid--
even kill your own son,
because I'm everything
and you're nothing."
Okay, Danny,
but if Hashem is everything
and we are nothing,
how then are we
to judge His actions?
We have free will and intelligence
which God allegedly gave us.
Wait, what are
you talking about?
God never lets
Abraham kill Isaac.
He gives him the ram
so he doesn't have to.
Personally,
I think that's a lie.
Teacher:
You think? Based on what?
Danny:
There's Midrash supporting it.
My father read a book
by Shalom Spiegel
that said Isaac died
and was reborn.
- No one follows that Midrash.
- I do. I follow it.
But okay,
say God provided the ram.
So what?
Once Abraham raised the knife,
it was as if he'd killed him
in his heart.
He could never forget that,
and neither could Isaac.
Look at him, he's traumatized.
He's a putz the rest of his life.
Danny, watch your language.
I think the whole Jewish people
were permanently scarred...
- Woman: Danny?
- ( knocking on door )
( door opens,
footsteps approach )
I knocked,
but you didn't answer.
What are you doing?
I just came to get some stuff.
I'll be gone in five minutes.
He's going to die. Huh.
He won't take his medicine,
he eats dairy.
Probably still smokes
when I'm not around.
I asked him
to move in with us.
It was Alex's idea, but
he doesn't want to be any trouble.
Ueah, well...
then he couldn't be
bitter about living alone.
Why deprive him
of his greatest pleasure?
( sighs )
Jesus Christ, Danny,
how can you wear that thing?
Linda, don't start with me.
Do you know what it means
to your people?
- They're not my people.
- Ueah?
- Tell that to Hitler.
- Oh, he decides?
Hitler's the chief rabbi now?
- Why?
- There's 50 reasons.
Even if you knew them all,
there'd be another 50
you didn't know.
Do you know them?
I made him some noodles
for dinner.
You can heat them up
and eat with him if you want.
I can't.
I got to go.
You can heat them up
and eat with him.
( sighs )
( TV plays )
It's Friday.
Do I give a shit?
The Torah says you can't
light a fire on Shabbos
- 'cause it's work, correct?
- Mm-hmm.
But if alternating current
is running through the wires
every second of every day
and I turn on a switch
sending it here
instead of there,
how is that lighting a fire?
- Do chickens give milk?
- Exactly.
Who's this?
It's Dennis Leary.
Funny?
Mmm, not like
your Uncle Mitch.
He was funny.
Mmm.
- ( phone rings )
- Hello?
- Man: Daniel Balint?
- Mm-hmm.
This is Guy Danielsen.
I'm a reporter and I'm doing
a piece on right wing groups
post Oklahoma City.
A reporter for who?
"Rolling Stone," "Esquire,"
"New Uork Times."
- I write for a lot of places.
- "New Uork Times"?
Ueah, and uh... Iisten,
I hear you have
a lot of interesting ideas.
- Daniel: Who told you that?
- Isn't it true?
No.
Ueah, it's true.
How'd you get this number?
Guy: Danny.
Hey, Guy Danielsen.
You? You looked different
at that meeting.
Well, you know.
So the other night,
you said that you thought
the modern world
was a Jewish disease.
Can you elaborate on that
a little bit?
In the movement,
this racialist movement,
we believe there is
a hierarchy of races.
You know, whites at the top,
blacks at the bottom.
Asians, Arabs, Latins...
somewhere in between.
Why are you writing this down
if you're recording it?
It helps me concentrate.
Danny,
what about the Jews?
Jews, Judaism--
it's like a sickness.
How is Judaism a sickness?
Take sexuality.
- Sexuality?
- Ueah.
- What do you mean?
- You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
What?
Did you ever fuck one?
Well, yeah...
I mean,
I've been out with--
There you go.
What did you notice?
Like what?
Jewish girls
love to give head.
- ( laughs )
- Right?
Ueah, sure. I don't know.
Is that right?
- And Jewish men love to get it.
- Everybody likes to get it.
Ues, it's very pleasurable,
but Jews are obsessed with it.
You want to know why?
Ues, why?
Because a Jew
is essentially female.
- Female.
- Ueah.
Real men--
white, Christian men--
we fuck a woman, we make her
come with our cocks.
But a Jew doesn't like
to penetrate and thrust.
He can't assert himself in that way,
so he resorts to these perversions.
Oral sex is technically
a perversion. You know that, right?
Ueah.
That's why after a woman's been
with a Jewish man, she's ruined.
She never wants to be
with a normal partner again.
So the Jew's a better lover.
He's not better.
That's not what I said.
I said he gives pleasure.
That's actually a weakness.
All right, so...
it's not that...
the Jew runs the media
or that he owns all the banks,
it's that they're
sexually corrupt.
The Jews clearly control
the media and the banks--
investment banks,
not the commercial ones--
but the point is,
they carry out in those realms
the exact same principles
that they display in sexuality.
They undermine traditional life
and they deracinate society.
Deracinate--
tear out the roots.
A real people derives
its genius from the land--
from the sun, from the sea,
from the soil.
This is how they know
themselves.
But, like, Jews don't
even have soil.
He has Israel.
- Those aren't Jews.
- Of course they're Jews.
Notice the Israelis.
It's a fundamentally
secular society.
They no longer need Judaism
because they have soil.
'Cause the real Jew
is a wanderer.
He's a nomad. He's got
no roots and no attachments.
So he universalizes everything.
He can't hammer a nail
or plow a field.
All he can do is buy, sell, invest
capital and manipulate markets.
You know, it's like all mental.
He takes the life of a people
that's rooted in soil,
and then he turns it
into this cosmopolitan culture
based on books
and numbers and ideas.
You know, this is
his strength.
Take the greatest
Jewish minds ever--
Marx, Freud, Einstein--
what have they given us?
Communism,
infantile sexuality,
and the atom bomb.
In the mere three centuries
it's taken these people
to emerge
from the ghettos of Europe,
they've ripped us out
of a world of order and reason.
They've thrown us into a chaos
of class warfare,
irrational urges,
relativity,
into a world where the existence of
matter and meaning is in question.
Why? 'Cause it's the deepest
impulse of a Jewish soul
to pull at the fabric of life till
there's nothing left but a thread.
They want nothing
but nothingness.
Nothingness without end.
Wow.
Danny, this is great.
You're incredibly articulate.
But one thing--
how can you believe
all of this
when you're a Jew yourself?
Excuse me?
Do you know a rabbi
Stanley Nadelman?
He was at the congregation
Oheb Zedeck.
Who?
How would I know him?
He said you were
bar mitzvahed there
in March of 1988.
He said--
and you believe that?
And you call yourself
a real reporter?
Okay, so you're saying
that's not true.
Do I look Jewish to you?
Look at this.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed
anywhere else?
Do you have any idea
who you're fucking with here?
No.
Who am I fucking with here?
- Not a--
- Not a what?
Fuck you.
Why would Nadelman lie to me?
To discredit me.
- Ueah, right.
- I know who they are.
I already explained this
to you, Guy.
These people will say and do
anything. It's all narrative.
Are you going to put
what he said in your paper?
- Give me a reason not to.
- 'Cause it's slander.
'Cause it's reckless disregard.
'Cause I'm gonna sue
your fucking Jew paper, that's why.
So you're denying
that what he said is true?
Ues or no?
All right, you know,
take it easy.
Hey...
Iook at me, Guy.
You can't even
look at me now, right?
( gun in mouth )
Danny, please don't.
You put that in
"The New Uork Times," Guy...
and I'm going to kill myself.
Teacher: Avi,
go ask Rabbi Springer to come
and remove Danny from my class.
Danny.
Daniel Balint!
Come back!
Is this it?
Thought there was people here.
I'll go look.
Hey, we're from New Uork.
Curtis Zampf invited us.
Who?
I don't know no Curtis.
Then what are you all
doing here? Circle jerk?
Ueah, you want to join in?
You look pretty good.
I pitch.
( laughs )
- Whit.
- Billings.
- Hi.
- Kyle.
Danny.
Hey, how are you doing?
- Man: Whoo!
- Man #2: Damn.
Hey, motherfucker.
Welcome, fuckface.
Man: Hey, come give me a kiss.
( men laughing )
You're not
in New Uork anymore.
Get up!
Get up!
Had enough? Huh?!
( man coughing )
Which room was his room?
He had the small cabin
down there.
Whit: Look, Hitler in '39
took out the RAF,
which he could've easily--
easily have done.
Then he could've taken England.
Then the US would never even--
Kyle: The final staging ground
for the invasion.
But he didn't-- he blew it
by going after civilian targets.
Just the way he blew it
on the Russian front--
- Stalingrad?
- Whit: Gettysburg.
We're re-fighting it
with World War I technology.
It's a fucking bloodbath.
It's about time somebody
kicked that guy's ass.
He's a fucking animal.
Not anymore.
You should've done it.
Ueah, right, like I could do
something like that.
Die, motherfucker.
You guys know anything
about explosives?
Hell yeah.
Daniel: Good.
Kyle: Now remember,
you control the gun.
Okay? A gun doesn't
control you. Relax.
Take a deep breath and let it out
as you pull the trigger.
- ( bird flies off )
- Okay, again.
Which one were you
aiming at?
Father.
Kyle:
Check this guy out.
Hey, Drake.
Nice shooting.
The prisoner returns.
Danny!
Help yourself to a drink.
I'll be there in a moment.
Why won't you talk to me?
- When can I see you?
- You can't.
I got to go see my father.
- I'm coming to your room tonight.
- No, you're not.
- I am whether you like it or not.
- Lina: Carla?
Fine.
1 2:00.
But not through the house,
they'll hear you.
Use the porch roof.
I'll leave the window open.
( Carla panting )
( moans )
Hey, I was just coming
to say goodbye.
I'm going to Boston.
Convert the lefties.
- Where's Mrs. Moebius and, uh...
- Carla?
She left about an hour ago.
How soon could you
be back in the city?
About a week or so.
There's something I want
to do out here first.
Oh yeah?
What's that?
Make an impact.
Skater boys.
Nice board, kid.
- I'll take the Pap smear to go.
- ( laughing )
- The gentile fish.
- Man: Ooh, I like his hair.
- ( laughing )
- Man: Who does your hair?
- Man #2: What's Drake having?
- Man #3: He'll have the waiter.
- You guys know what you want?
- Billings: We sure do.
Could I get a ham and cheese...
on white?
We don't serve ham,
we don't serve cheese.
- Well, they serve white.
- Man: What the fuck do you serve?
That's why you have the menus.
Could I have roast beef
with Swiss?
- We don't serve cheese.
- What's wrong with cheese?
This is a kosher restaurant.
We don't serve meat with dairy.
What about with chicken?
Chicken's meat.
It says in the Bible you don't see
the kid in its mother's milk,
but chicken's don't give milk.
You guys want cheese that badly,
there's a pizza place next door.
- You can go there.
- Okay. It's stupid though, right?
I mean, admit that it's stupid.
- Whit: You ever milk a chicken?
- ( laughing )
No, I won't admit
it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs
but you can't have it with milk?
Why is that?
- All right. Steve?
- Oh, Steve.
- Maybe Steve can explain it.
- Hi, Steve.
Steve, come over here.
You can explain this to us.
- Stevie boy.
- Stevie got a stick.
- I got a stick, too.
- No, no, no, let's ask him.
- Oh, sweetie.
- Hey.
- Got a problem here?
- Billings: We fucking do, bitch.
We don't understand why
you can't have chicken with milk.
It doesn't make sense.
Religion's not
about making sense.
It's about the incomprehensible,
Steve. Not the idiotic.
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.
That explains it.
Now we understand.
Don't point your fucking finger
in his face, understand?
Why don't you guys
just get out of here?
-...finger out of my face.
- My store.
Well...
since this fight seems to have been
instigated equally by both sides,
I'm going
to give you a choice.
You can spend 30 days in jail,
or you can take
some sensitivity training
with some people whose experiences
have been different from yours.
When I refused
to have sex with him,
the warden ordered
my sister Esther shot...
right in front of me.
Everyone considered it my fault,
so after that, of course,
I did anything he wanted.
- Who'd want to fuck her, anyway?
- ( laughs )
I hear one more
remark like that,
and we go back to court
for re-sentencing. Sit down, please!
He was a pig like you,
so perhaps he had no taste.
Thank you, Mrs. Frankel.
Man: The man was afraid to let us
hide on his farm any longer.
But he agreed to take us
to a more remote place.
But on the way,
we were stopped
by a checkpoint.
When the soldiers
found us in the hay,
one of them tried to take
my son out of my arms.
He began to cry,
so I held onto him.
Not to refuse the soldier,
but simply--
simply to assure my son
I was there.
But...
the sergeant became enraged.
He stuck his bayonet...
in my son's chest and
lifted him up impaled on it.
My son was three years old.
He held him so that
the blood spurting out of him
fell on my face.
Soldiers were laughing.
And when the blood stopped,
the sergeant pushed my son
off his bayonet and said...
"There, you can
have him now."
What'd you do?
Counselor:
What are you trying to say?
What did you do while the sergeant
was killing your son?
Mrs. Frankel:
What could he have done?
Daniel:
What could he have done?
Sergeant's killing his kid.
What could he have done?!
He could've jumped the guy,
gouged his eyes out,
- grabbed his bayonet--
- They would've shot him.
He would've been dead
in two seconds.
- Who are you to judge?
- So he's dead!
Big deal! He's worse than dead now.
He's a piece of shit!
Okay, that's it.
You're going back.
- What should he have done?
- Danny, don't listen to him.
- It's all a bunch of crap.
- What's crap?
The so-called holocaust.
It never happened.
- Oh, please.
- It's true, Danny.
There was no six million.
At most, 200,000 Jews died
in the camps, and the majority--
Have you studied
the deportation figures?
Man:
The Nazis kept records.
If Hitler didn't kill
six million Jews,
why in the hell
is he a hero?
( laughs )
He's got concentration camps
all over Europe,
and he only manages to get rid
of a measly 200,000?
- He's a fucking putz!
- Hitler wasn't a putz.
Hitler was real.
God created him
to punish the Jews
for abandoning the Torah.
- For God's sakes, Chaim, not here.
- Remember who you're talking to.
It is you who are putzes.
You little pishers...
with your dreams
of hatred and killing.
What do you think you would
have done if you had been there?
Not what he did.
Just stand there and watch?
How do you know?
You've never been tested
like he has.
Here in this rich, safe,
stupid country
it is so easy
to imagine oneself a hero.
But you have no idea what it was
like. You can't conceive of it.
Everything--
all of Europe--
was designed to break
one's will.
Millions went to camps.
Many stronger, braver than you.
They did nothing,
just as you would
have done nothing.
Counselor: Where do you think
you're going?
We have nothing to learn
from these people.
They should be
learning from us.
And what should we learn
from you, Daniel?
Kill your enemy.
- What?
- Let me show you something.
- What is it?
- Black powder,
blasting caps,
3/4-inch galvanized pipe.
- Enough to blow up a lot of people.
- Daniel: Good.
Whit:
Hey, Danny.
- Man: Shit! Where's the light?
- Billings: Get off my fucking foot.
- Get the fuck off my foot, man.
- Fuck you.
It's over here.
Fucking shit.
Oooh.
- Jew world!
- Ueah! Whoo!
Pass! Pass!
- I'm open. Hit me!
- Ueah!
- Hey, over here, over here.
- Touchdown!
Ueah, baby, yeah!
( various shouts, cheers )
Come on, man!
Ueah, yeah, yeah.
( spray paint can shakes,
sprays )
Shut up.
Fuck you.
What?
Nothing.
What is it?
Let's take one of these panels off,
hook it under the bima.
Huh.
Wow, man,
look at this thing.
Man: Hey,
what are you guys doing?
Hey, hey, put it back.
- Hey.
- Put it back.
- Fore!
- Look at the fucking thing.
- ( laughing )
- Man: Oh man, it's like a treasure.
Look at this.
' If I were king
of the forest '
' Not prince, not duke. '
All right,
all right, it's set.
- It's set?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, we should go.
- Come look at this fucking thing.
- Holy shit!
- Oh, that's weird.
- What the--
- They read right to left.
- ( laughing )
- Look like squashed bugs.
- What kind of paper is this?
- Is it ink?
- Is it blood?
- No, they use soy, man.
- Danny, you all right?
- Soy.
Neat calligraphy.
It's called
the flame alphabet.
They think it's the word
of God written in fire.
- Cool.
- How come you know all this shit?
How come you don't?
How can you say you hate Jews if
you don't know anything about 'em?
Fuck you. I hate the Jews
just as much as you do.
Really?
What's shatnez?
Tzitzith?
- Titties.
- What?
- Tefillin?
- Who cares?
You know the kaddish
from the kiddish?
If you do hate something, you study
it so you know why you hate it.
Eichmann? He studied the Torah,
the Talmud, the Mishnah--
the whole thing.
He hated Jews.
- Who's Eichmann?
- Daniel: Who's Eichmann?
Eichmann was head of
the Gestapo's Jewish sector.
He deported people
to the camps.
- Hey, don't touch the letters.
- Why the fuck not?
- Just don't!
- Fucking asshole.
Did you see
"Raiders of the Lost Ark"?
What?
That was an ark, man.
That was a Torah.
They fucked around with it
and melted their faces.
- That was a movie, asshole.
- Go ahead, touch the letters.
- Touch the letters, I dare ya.
- Let me see.
Touch it, man.
Hey. Hey!
What do you think of that?!
Billings: Fuck you!
Fuck them!
Fuck you!
Let's go.
Man #2: Come on, man,
let's get the fuck out of here.
Man #3:
Hey! Let's go!
Man on TV: Everyone's wary out here
about what's going to happen next.
- Oh shit, guys, this is it.
- Hi, I'm Cindy Pomerantz,
- with Channel 8 News...
- Guys! Guys!
- with Rabbi Malcolm Greenwald.
- Guys! Get in here. This is it.
Cindy: How is it that tragedy and
disaster were averted in the Temple?
Rabbi: The power cell on the timer
gave out precisely 1 3 minutes...
- Shit.
-...before it was set to go off.
Once again, God intervened
to save the Jewish people.
Cindy, as you know,
1 3 is a mystical number
in the Jewish faith.
We believe that God
has 1 3 attributes
of which the highest
is "Ain Sof,"
which means "without end"
or sometimes it means,
"nothingness without end."
Cindy:
"Nothingness without end."
Interesting.
It's the purest
form of spirit.
- Fuck.
- Thank you so much, Rabbi.
Drake:
Somebody turn on cartoons.
I'm Cindy Pomerantz
with Channel 8 News,
and I'm standing
in front of Temple...
( singing in Hebrew )
( singing in Hebrew )
Man: Danny!
- What?
- Phone!
- Hello.
- Hey, Daniel Balint, how you doing?
- Who's this?
- It's Guy Danielsen.
Whatever happened
to your article?
I couldn't get
an editor to run it.
But I bet I can now that you put
a bomb in the synagogue.
That was you,
wasn't it, Danny?
Hey.
You want to kill a Jew?
Drake:
It's right up there.
Just park around the corner
and we'll walk back.
( faint applause )
Danny: There's the applause.
It must be over.
Lie on your stomach.
Come up on your elbows.
Why me?
'Cause you want to kill a Jew,
and I already did.
Really?
Who'd you kill?
Drake:
Four of them.
But no one this important.
How'd you know
they were Jews?
Drake: I can tell.
Daniel: How?
I was a Jew
in a previous life.
- Manzetti: Thank you all very much.
- Here they come.
Thank you.
Thank you again.
Drake: Shoot him in the head.
Always shoot a Jew in the head.
- I'm a bad shot.
- Just keep him in the crosshairs.
Right there.
Squeeze the trigger...
slowly.
- Do it.
- Good night, thank you again.
- Woman: Oh my God!
- Daniel: Damn it!
- You missed on purpose.
- No, I didn't.
I had him in the crosshairs
like you said. I'm a bad shot.
- What's this?
- What?
Fucking kike.
I knew it.
( gunshot, groans )
Man:
It came from over there.
Young Daniel: The whole Jewish
people were permanently scarred
by what happened at Mount Moriah.
And we still live in terror.
Boy: Fear of the Lord
is the beginning of wisdom.
Fear of God makes you
afraid of everything.
All the Jews are good at is being
afraid and being sacrificed.
- ( bangs )
- Do you even believe in God?
I'm the only one
who does believe.
I see Him for the power-drunk
madman that He is.
And we're supposed to worship
such a deity? I say never!
Avi, go ask Rabbi Springer to come
and remove Danny from my class.
And you-- if you had come out of
Egypt you would have been destroyed
in the desert with all those
who worshipped the golden calf.
Then let Him destroy me now.
Let Him crush me like
the conceited bully that He is.
Go ahead.
Teacher: Danny!
Daniel Balint!
Come back!
- How are things going?
- Fine.
We'd like to talk to you
about something.
- Are you all right?
- Ueah, yeah.
Lina: We are about to launch an
aboveground, intellectually serious,
fascist movement.
We want to build bridges
to certain positions in politics.
Works like "The Bell Curve,"
"Sociobiology,"
"Earth First,"
"The Genome Project."
We want to have lectures, invite
blacks and Jews and liberals.
Chomsky speaks,
Stanley Crouch.
You know, I've been waiting my whole
life for something like this.
Lina: We want you
to help us run it.
Give speeches,
lead seminars.
Handle the fundraising.
Handle the fundraising?
We need someone
with intelligence.
Well, what about the synagogues
and Manzetti and all of that?
We need intellectuals.
We have enough thugs.
I'm not an intellectual.
I read, but...
fundraising,
it's just-- it's--
Lina: Danny, we want you
to talk to people.
Can you do that for us?
Well yeah, sure,
I can, you know...
Do you have a decent suit?
Curtis:
We'll get him one.
We'll sort him out.
We'll...
get him a cell phone
and anything else he needs.
( vomiting )
( coughing )
( shower running )
- Where'd you get this?
- Where'd I get what?
What are you doing?
Where'd you get it?
I stole it from
the synagogue.
Can you read it?
Lookit, put something on. You're not
supposed to be naked in front of it.
Why not?
Because it's-- they think
it's the word of God
and it's holy
and the flesh isn't.
That's stupid.
Ues, it's stupid.
Put something on.
You see, the Jews love
to separate things.
Holy from the profane,
the meat from the milk,
wool from the linen,
Sabbath from the week,
Jew from the gentile,
as if one little scrap of this
is going to completely
contaminate that.
Who gets contaminated,
the Jews or the gentiles?
That's a good question.
How come there's
no punctuation?
That was a later invention,
and, you know,
Jews don't really need it because
they know the whole thing by heart.
Every word and every letter.
Do you know it like that?
By heart?
No.
But you can read it, right?
The Hebrew?
- What do you care?
- Because I want to know.
What's this word?
Daniel: Don't touch it.
Um... that's...
"vayomar."
"And he said."
What did he say?
( speaking Hebrew )
What does it mean?
"And God said to Avraham,
'Take yourself
away from your land,
away from the place you were born,
away from your father's house...
( sighs )
and go to a new land,
a place that I will show you.'"
I want you
to teach it to me.
Why?
Know your enemy.
Because it's a basic text
of Western culture,
and I want to read it
in the original, okay?
Listen, it's extremely difficult.
It would take you years to learn it.
I'm good at languages.
Okay.
Will you get that piece of paper
and that pen over there?
- Daniel: Aleph.
- It looks like a little swastika.
Huh?
It's silent and it takes a vowel.
There aren't any vowels,
they're just like little dots
that go underneath the letters.
I'll get you a chumash.
- Bet.
- Bet.
- Gimmel.
- Gimmel.
- Dalet.
- Dalet.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How come you're here
and not with Curtis?
And don't say it's 'cause
of the free Hebrew lesson.
Sex is better.
Even though he's--
he's got such a big dick?
Well, with you there's
a tragic dimension.
How many of you consider
yourself anti-Semites?
Good.
Actually the term's
a bit imprecise,
seeing as Jews are only
one of the Semitic peoples.
But for our purposes,
we'll say that an anti-Semite
is someone that hates
or is against Jews.
Why do we hate 'em?
Let me put it this way...
do we hate them 'cause
they go where they don't belong?
Or do we hate them 'cause they're
clannish and keep to themselves?
'Cause they're tight with money,
or 'cause they flash it around?
'Cause they're Bolsheviks or
because they're capitalists?
'Cause they have the highest IQs
or the most active sex lives?
You want to know the real reason
why we hate 'em?
'Cause we hate 'em.
'Cause they exist.
'Cause it's an axiom of civilization
that just as man longs for woman,
Ioves his children and
fears death, he hates Jews.
There's no reason.
And if there were,
some smart-ass kike would try
and come up with an argument,
try and prove us wrong, which would
only make us hate them even more.
Really, we have all the reasons
we need in three simple letters.
J-E-W.
Jew. You say it
a million times,
it's the only word
that never loses its meaning.
Jew, Jew, Jew.
Jew. Jew. Jew, Jew, Jew,
Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew!
I'll give your group
1,000 bucks.
You gave 50,000
to that college magazine.
Things were possible then
that aren't now.
I actually feel this moment
has a lot of possibilities.
I read your piece.
It's very smart...
and very wrong.
In what ways?
Forget the Jewish stuff.
It doesn't play anymore.
There's only the market now,
and it doesn't care who you are.
People still need
values and beliefs.
No, they don't.
Not the smart ones.
Look...
I'll give you five grand if you can
document your tax exempt status.
But when you fall
off this horse, come see me.
I can show you how
to make a lot of money.
I don't care about money.
You will.
You're a Jew.
You may not realize it,
but you are.
Maybe I am.
Maybe we're all Jews now.
What's the difference?
What about Drake?
Did he ever show up?
No, man, it's weird.
No one's seen him.
This is going to be a completely
different kind of device, okay?
Stupid thing. Do you have
any idea how that made me look
in front of Curtis and Lina?
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again, okay?
I got a brand new timer
plus a backup power source.
Gotta kill some Jews.
That's all I ever talk about,
and this time
it's got to happen.
It will.
You should go.
( klezmer music playing )
( soft thud )
Woman: On Shabbos, is it permitted
to pick up the phone
if it's been ringing long?
Man: No. It could be
a wrong number.
But if you think it might be
a relative needing help,
you should knock the phone off
the hook with your elbow
and listen to see
who's on the line.
( overlapping voices )
Woman: May we peel oranges
on Shabbos?
( voices overlapping )
- Man: Danny?
- ( voices continuing )
Danny.
Hey! It's Stuart.
Schoenbaum. Schlomo.
- Schlomo.
- Danny. God...
God, it's been years.
How you doing?
What are you doing?
I'm doing great. I'm at
the rabbinic program up at JTS.
- JTS.
- What are you doing?
Something strange I bet.
No, just-- it's kind
of an underground thing.
Like an artist?
No, uh...
Iike a private business.
Hey, you remember Miriam.
Ueah.
Hey.
- Hey.
- She's at Uale Law now,
interning for
the District Attorney.
We're getting married
next spring in Jerusalem.
That's great.
Maybe Danny'd like to come
to the minyan for Rosh Hashanah.
Great idea. We're davening
with a group from the seminary.
Guess who comes? Avi. You two
can go at it like you used to.
Danny and Avi used to argue
about everything.
Talmud, Torah,
politics, girls--
- It always ended in a fistfight.
- I remember.
- I always won.
- The arguments, anyway.
Here, it's up at KI,
up on 1 01 st.
Try to make it.
It could be fun.
Ueah.
' My country 'tis of thee '
' Sweet land of liberty '
' Of thee I sing. '
( Carla speaking Hebrew )
( speaks Hebrew,
Carla repeats )
"To make no graven image
of the Lord
or the form of any figure
or of man or woman
or of anything that looks
like anything,
because He's not
like anything."
Not only can you not
see Him or hear Him,
but you can't even
think about Him?
What's the difference between that
and Him not existing at all?
There's no difference.
Christianity's silly, but at least
there's something to believe in.
Or not believe.
I mean, Judaism
there's nothing.
Nothing but nothingness.
Judaism's not
really about belief.
It's about doing things.
Keeping the Sabbath,
lighting candles,
visiting the sick.
And belief follows?
Nothing follows.
You don't do it because
it's smart or it's stupid.
You don't do it because you get
saved, because nobody gets saved.
You do it because the Torah tells
you to and you submit to the Torah.
That is fucked.
Don't swear in front of it,
okay?
- Why should I submit?
- You shouldn't.
You think I should just
because there's no reason?
I think you shouldn't.
Judaism doesn't need a God. You have
the Torah. That's your fucking God.
The book's closed.
I think your Hebrew's
getting real good.
I told you
I was good at this.
You also have nothing else
to do all day, so...
Are you saying I learned it
better and faster than you did?
Maybe it's because
I'm smarter.
- ( laughs )
- You think that's funny?
You think Jews are
the only smart ones?
You think I'm Jewish?
It's all you ever talk about.
Jewish, Jewish, Jewish.
Only people that ever talk
about it that much are Jews.
Nazis talk about it
all the time.
Do they?
Real ones.
Hitler and Goebbels,
they talked about it incessantly.
Is that why
you became a Nazi,
to talk about Jews
incessantly?
- You want a punch in the mouth?
- Okay.
Let's light candles on Friday
and say the kaddish.
Kaddish is a prayer
for the dead.
Kiddish.
Say the kiddish.
Light candles.
Come on.
We could shave my head,
fuck through a sheet--
all that stuff.
Let's just try it.
( woman singing in Hebrew )
( group chants )
Rabbi:
He said to him, "Abraham."
And then he answered,
"Here I am."
Then he said, "Take your son,
your only son...
whom you love, Isaac...
Daniel:
It's not his only son.
Man:
It's the only one he loves.
- Stuart: Hey, Avi.
- Hey.
( speaking Hebrew )
You only kill the ones
you love, is that right?
What are you doing here?
I thought you were an anti-Semite.
- Would you grow up?
- He's a skinhead.
It's just a style.
Avi, there are anti-racist skins.
Danny's the racist kind.
You a fascist, Danny?
- He thinks the Jews are wimps.
- What's a fascist?
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi.
He always was.
- Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
- The Zionists are not Nazis.
They're racist, and act like
Stormtroopers in the territories.
And do you hate them because
they're wimps or Stormtroopers?
- They have no extermination camps.
- They have Sabra and Shattila.
- Do you just hate them?
- That wasn't genocide,
that was the Lebanese killing each
other. The Israelis knew nothing.
They knew-- Sharon encouraged
the Falangists to murder them.
- We don't know that.
- Ever read "The New Uork Times"?
It was a war. People get killed.
I want to know why the Jews
- are held to a higher standard.
- Because we're the chosen people.
Isn't that right, Daniel?
Isn't that right?
Read early Zionist and European
Jewry. They sound like Goebbels.
They sound like you.
Just how Nazis did everything
Hitler told them,
- you do what the Torah tells you--
- Miriam: Stop!
- It's identical slave mentality.
- We don't want that in here.
- Shhh!
- Not in shul.
Why'd you come tonight?
To see me?
To study Torah.
I thought you hated Torah.
Doesn't mean
I don't like to study it.
Expose all the lies
and fucked up thinking.
You know the joke, a Jew's
shipwrecked on a desert island?
When they rescue him they see
he's built two synagogues.
They say, "For what you build
two synagogues? "
He says,
"One to pray in,
and one to never set foot in
so long as I live, so help me God."
You pray in the one
you'd never set foot in...
and vice versa.
This is me.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
- How did you know about Lina?
- I work in the DA's office.
You go to those meetings, half
the people there are informants.
Like who,
that "Times" guy?
- Which "Times" guy?
- There's more than one?
- Fuck.
- Be careful.
Half the right-wing money
in New Uork is here tonight.
They've come to see you.
If you impress them...
if you do what
I know you can,
this movement will be up
and running by tomorrow.
And we will be
on the front page
of "The New Uork Times"
in six months.
- Here he is.
- Is that him?
( applause )
Man:
Balint. Daniel Balint.
( applause stops )
( singing in Hebrew )
( crowd murmuring )
- Does anyone know what that is?
- Man: A Jewish prayer.
Do you have any idea
why I would say a Jewish prayer?
- Because you're a Jew.
- ( scattered chuckles )
That could be one reason.
What's another?
Let me put it this way--
who wants to destroy
the Jews?
Who wants to grind
their bones into the dust?
Who wants to see them
rise again?
Wealthier, more successful,
powerful, cultured,
more intelligent than ever.
You know what we have to do?
We have to love 'em.
What?
Did he say love the Jews?
It's strange, I know.
But with these people,
nothing is simple.
The Jew says all he wants is
to be left alone to study his Torah,
do a little business,
fornicate with his oversexed
wife, but it's not true.
He wants to be hated.
He longs for our scorn.
He clings to it as if it were
the very core of his being.
If Hitler had not existed,
the Jews would have invented him.
For without such hatred,
the so-called chosen people
would vanish from the earth.
And this reveals
a terrible truth,
and really the crux
of our problem as Nazis.
The worse the Jews are treated,
the stronger they become.
Egyptian slavery
made them a nation,
the pogroms hardened them,
Auschwitz gave birth
to the State of Israel.
Suffering, it seems, is
the very crucible of their genius.
So if the Jews are,
as one of their own has said,
a people who will not
take yes for an answer,
Iet us say yes to them.
They thrive on opposition?
Let us cease to oppose them.
The only way to annihilate this
insidious people once and for all
is to open our arms,
invite them into our homes,
and embrace them.
Only then will they vanish
into assimilation,
normality and love.
But we cannot pretend.
The Jew is nothing
if not clever.
He will see through hypocrisy
and condescension.
To destroy him
we must love him sincerely.
Ues.
If the Jews are
strengthened by hate,
then wouldn't this "destruction"
that you speak of,
whether it's by love
or any other means,
wouldn't that make them more
powerful than they are already?
Ues. Infinitely more.
They would become as God.
Lookit, it's the Jews' destiny to be
annihilated so they can be deified.
Jesus understood this
perfectly.
Look what was accomplished with the
death of just one enlightened Jew.
Imagine what would happen
if we killed them all?
So let us say together...
( sings in Hebrew )
Are you out of your mind?!
I was just making a point.
What point?
I do not want you
working for us anymore.
Curtis: Lina!
Lina, come here!
According to the police,
he had just left the restaurant
and was walking a block
and a half back to his office
when the gunman
stepped out of this doorway,
fired seven times at point
blank range,
then fled on foot. Paramedics
arrived within 90 seconds,
but Mr. Manzetti was declared
dead here at the scene.
The assailant is described
as a white male in his 20s...
- You think that I...
- Danny...
we don't want to know.
Hey, Mr. Manzetti.
Hey, Mr. Manzetti.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
( gunshot )
Lina Moebius is saying
the whole thing was your idea.
She said you proposed it
at a meeting at her house.
Oh, Jesus, Danny.
- I can't help what I think.
- You don't think that.
- I don't?
- Tell me you think it.
Are you glad Manzetti's dead?
You really want to kill Jews?
You want to kill me?
What if all along,
you were actually
infiltrating the Nazis
to expose them?
- I wasn't.
- And killing Manzetti
was just to convince them
you were a real anti-Semite.
If you had any idea somebody'd
actually shoot the guy--
- It's not true.
- Think about your father, Linda.
You don't care
about the truth at all, do you?
Danny, I'm trying
to save you.
Fucking...
kike!
I need you to get
Lina Moebius on tape...
telling you to do something.
Something violent.
I don't care about the truth.
I care about you.
Kol Nidre's at 6:30.
I got to meet Stuart.
Come there if you need me.
What is this?
It's Erev Uom Kippur.
We'll have dinner,
then go to shul.
Atone for our sins.
Come on, we can be
like Eichmann.
He studied Torah,
he hated Jews.
Is it like Eichmann?
Are you just goofing?
I don't know.
- I just wanted to try it.
- Why?
Because God commands it?
I thought God didn't exist.
He commands it
whether He exists or not.
Look, we can fight Him
and be crushed,
or we can submit.
And be crushed.
But what if...
what if submitting,
being crushed,
being nothing,
not mattering--
what if that's the best feeling
we can have?
Look, just light
the candles with me.
You know, then we can eat.
You have to eat.
You eat first,
then you light the candles.
'Cause once you light
the candles
it's Uom Kippur
and you're fasting.
I got to go.
Miriam, pick up the phone.
The holiday hasn't even started yet.
Pick up-- hello?
Stuart's davening Ne'ilah
tomorrow, right?
'Cause he always does.
Tell him
I'm doing it instead.
I'm davening.
Tell him if he gives me any trouble,
I'll beat the shit out of him.
- Kyle: Did you kill Manzetti?
- No, I didn't kill Manzetti.
Daniel: Drake did.
Is this 60th?
Turn here. Turn right.
- Why? Why?
- Just do it.
Daniel: Why so fast?
Would you relax?
- What time should it go off?
- Shh, shh, shh.
( whispering )
7:30 tomorrow night.
7:30 tomorrow.
19:30 minus...
- Shh, shh.
- ( muttering )
- Hand me the tape.
- Here.
It's all reinforced in here. It
won't blow out the way we want it.
Look, I know this guy
at a lumberyard.
- I can get some dynamite.
- No.
It has to be tomorrow.
It's gonna be fine,
as long as it blow up
the pulpit.
- It's not going to blow out--
- Do it.
Ilio Manzetti was one
of the most respected
and influential men
in New Uork.
As an investment banker,
diplomat,
advisor to presidents
and mayors,
he helped shape public
and private policy
for more than three decades.
He'll be missed, though.
This is Michael Porter
for New Uork 1.
Reporter: You're saying that when
he first appeared at your house,
you had no idea
that he was Jewish?
None whatsoever. But I can't say
I'm terribly surprised.
Reporter:
What do you mean?
I think anti-Semitism today
is largely a Jewish phenomenon.
Wouldn't you agree?
In the Third Reich, weren't
a number of high ranking Nazis
of Jewish origin?
Gut yontiff.

Woman: He said to him, "You have
brought this misfortune upon us.
What is your business?
Where have you come from?
What is your country
and of what people are you? "
"I am a Hebrew," he replied.
"I worship the Lord,
the God of Heaven
who made both sea and land."
Hey.
- What are you doing here?
- Miriam called looking for you.
- She told me about the service.
- Woman #2: Would you be quiet?
- I thought you'd come.
- You got to go, okay?
Look, I understand
you want to daven,
- but these people--
- Stuart, shut up.
Danny, please.
Listen, you have to leave.
- Woman #2: Young man, please!
- Shhh!
- Hey.
- Man: Can you take this outside?
- You're leaving, that's it.
- I'm trying to read this, okay?
Woman: What must we do to you
to make the sea calm around us?
For the sea was growing
more and more stormy.
He answered, "Heave me overboard
and the sea will calm down for you,
for I know that this terrible storm
came upon you on my account."
( thud )
( gunshot )
Let me talk to him.
Danny, the congregation
is expecting me to daven.
They don't want someone
they don't know.
Stuart, I got to do this.

( praying in Hebrew )
Jesus Christ, you know
who that is? You see the paper?
You read the paper
on Uom Kippur, Barry?
I saw the paper.
That's not him.
This guy was at Rosh Hashanah
with Stuart and Miriam.
- That guy would never go to shul.
- You want to bet?
- I'm going to go get a cop.
- Woman: Fine, get a cop.
I'm sure it's him.
( praying in Hebrew )
( singing in Hebrew )
- Woman: Why's he stopping?
- You got to go.
You wanted to daven,
now daven.
- There's a bomb.
- Come on, Danny.
I came in here last night and
I put a bomb underneath the beam.
It'll go off at 7:30. You have five
minutes to get everyone out of here.
- What did he say?
- There's a bomb, go!
Man: A bomb?
- Oh my God.
- We need to get out of the room!
David, get your wife
out of here. Go!
We have an emergency. Everybody
needs to exit the building.
Avi, get everybody out.
Everybody go, hurry!
Outside on the wall.
( voices shouting )
- Man: Mother, watch your step.
- Out the door!
Miriam:
Danny, come on! Danny!
Danny!
- Let's go!
- What about Danny?
- He's not coming.
- What do you mean he's not coming?
Teacher: If you had come out of
Egypt, you would have been destroyed
in the desert with all those
who worshipped the golden calf.
Then let Him destroy me now.
Go ahead. Kill me.
Here I am.
Do it.
( sighs )
( loud rumbling )
( metal door clangs )
Teacher: Danny.
Glad you came back.
I wanted to take up
that discussion we were having.
- I can't right now.
- About Abraham and Isaac.
You remember what you said?
That Isaac actually died
on Mount Moriah.
I've been thinking maybe
you were right about that.
You remember what you said? That
Isaac actually died on Mount Moriah.
I've been thinking,
maybe you were right about that.
Died... and then reborn
in the world to come.
You remember what you said?

Danny, stop.
Where do you think
you're going?
Don't you know?
There's nothing up there.
( footsteps pounding )
( instrumental music playing )
( overlapping whispers )
Teacher: "...your only son
whom you love, Isaac,
and go unto
the land of Moriah
and offer him there
as a sacrifice
on a mountain
that I will show you."
So...
"I will show you."
Boy: It was a test
of Abraham's faith,
of his devotion to God.
Young Daniel:
It's not about Abraham's faith.
It's about God's power.
Daniel:
Abstraction.
They're obsessed
with abstraction.
Young Daniel:
"Kill your only son,
because I'm everything
and you're nothing."
"You're nothing."
- ( Rabbi speaking )
- Daniel: Jews.
Judaism.
They're still just Jews.
Differences exist, of course.
All right?
But they're irrelevant,
'cause for a Jew, his Jewishness
dominates everything.
And even the ones
who renounce it,
and who hate its strength and want
to cut it out of their hearts...
