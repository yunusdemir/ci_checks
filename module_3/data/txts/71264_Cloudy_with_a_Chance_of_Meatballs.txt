<i>Have you ever felt like
you were a little bit different?</i>
<i>Like you had something unique
to offer the world...</i>
<i>...if you could just get people
to see it.</i>
<i>Then you know exactly how it felt...</i>
<i>...to be me.</i>
<i>Go ahead, Flint.</i>
<i>What is the number one problem
facing our community today?</i>
<i>Untied shoelaces.</i>
<i>Which is why I've invented
a laceless alternative foot covering.</i>
<i>Spray-On Shoes.</i>
<i>- Voilà.
- They're so nifty.</i>
<i>How you gonna get them off, nerd?</i>
<i>What a freak.
He wants to be smart, but that's lame.</i>
<i>I wanted to run away that day.</i>
<i>But you can't run away
from your own feet.</i>
<i>Not every sardine is meant
to swim, son.</i>
<i>I don't understand
fishing metaphors.</i>
<i>- What did I say?
- Don't worry.</i>
<i>Honey, I think your shoes
are wonderful.</i>
<i>Everyone just thinks I'm a weirdo.</i>
<i>So?</i>
<i>People probably thought
that these guys were weirdoes too.</i>
<i>But that never stopped them.</i>
<i>I was saving this
for your birthday, but here.</i>
<i>A professional-grade lab coat.</i>
<i>Just like the real guys wear.</i>
<i>It fits perfect.</i>
<i>The world needs
your originality, Flint.</i>
<i>You just have to grow into it.</i>
<i>And I know that you're gonna do
big things someday.</i>
<i>From that moment on...</i>
<i>...I was determined
to invent something great.</i>
<i>Remote Control Television.</i>
<i>And, the pitch is in.</i>
<i>Eventually.</i>
<i>Hair Un-Balder.</i>
<i>Flying Car.</i>
<i>Monkey Thought Translator.</i>
<i>- Hungry. Hungry. Hungry.
- How wise.</i>
<i>No, Steve. No, no, no, no, no!
No, please! Leave it-</i>
<i>Ratbirds.</i>
<i>Hey, what's going on, little guy?</i>
<i>Flint Lockwood.</i>
<i>My dream was to help
my hometown...</i>
<i>...a tiny island hidden under
the "A" in "Atlantic"...</i>
<i>...called Swallow Falls.</i>
<i>We were famous for sardines...</i>
<i>...until the day the Baby Brent
Sardine Cannery closed for good.</i>
<i>Right after everyone in the world
realized that sardines...</i>
<i>...are super gross.</i>
<i>Soon, all of us were stuck eating
the sardines that no one else wanted.</i>
<i>Poached, fried, boiled, dried,
candied and juiced.</i>
<i>Life became gray and flavourless.</i>
<i>But when all seemed lost,
I stared at defeat...</i>
<i>...and found hope.</i>
<i>My name is Flint Lockwood.</i>
<i>And I was about to invent
a machine...</i>
<i>...that turns water...</i>
<i>...into food.</i>
<i>Steve, my best friend
and trusted colleague.</i>
<i>Steve.</i>
<i>Can I count on your help?</i>
<i>Can.</i>
<i>I knew I could.</i>
<i>Button, on.
Memory, activate.</i>
<i>Blueprints, awesome.
Begin nano-mutation.</i>
<i>Radiation matrix, secure.</i>
<i>Computer, boot.</i>
<i>Coolness enhancement, complete.</i>
<i>Engage coffee break.</i>
<i>Networking power grid.</i>
<i>Beginning conversion of water...</i>
<i>...into food.</i>
<i>Hydrating protein matrix.</i>
<i>Calibrating flavour panel.</i>
<i>Priming chow plopper.</i>
<i>Uploading cool machine voice.</i>
<i>Cheeseburger.</i>
<i>Everyone is going to love this.</i>
<i>Flint!</i>
<i>Sorry, Dad.</i>
<i>Steve, keep working.</i>
<i>Scanning hand.</i>
<i>That's a really weird dude.</i>
<i>Re-energizing tower unit.</i>
<i>Jeez. See you, Dad.</i>
<i>Flint.</i>
<i>Don't you think it's time to give up
this inventing thing, get a real job?</i>
<i>No, why?</i>
<i>Well, all your technology stuff,
it just ends in disaster.</i>
<i>The ratbirds, yes, they escaped
and bred at a surprising rate.</i>
<i>But I took care of that problem
and disposed of them.</i>
<i>Billy, just play dead.</i>
<i>Flint, you don't keep throwing your net
where there aren't any fish.</i>
<i>- What?
- I want you to work full-time...</i>
<i>...at the tackle shop.
- The tackle shop? Dad, no.</i>
<i>Tackle is a good career.</i>
<i>Please, I'm so close with this one.</i>
<i>I just have to hook it up to the power
station and give it power and it'll work.</i>
<i>And then you could sell food
in the shop...</i>
<i>...and then everyone won't have to eat
sardines anymore.</i>
<i>It is going to be so awesome.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, son.</i>
<i>No more inventing.</i>
<i>Dad, I know I can do this.</i>
<i>And Mom did too.</i>
<i>It had been almost 10 years
since Mom died...</i>
<i>...and Dad still didn't understand me
like she did.</i>
<i>Come on. Let's open the shop.</i>
<i>Tim and Son
Sardine Bait and Tackle.</i>
<i>You feeling it?</i>
<i>Look out, Baby Brent!</i>
<i>Baby Brent Sardines.</i>
<i>Hand-packed in Swallow Falls.</i>
<i>As your mayor, I know it's time to put
our sardine-canning past behind us...</i>
<i>...and look to the future.</i>
<i>Sardine tourism!</i>
<i>That's why,
without consulting anyone...</i>
<i>...I spent the entire town budget
on the thing that is under this tarp...</i>
<i>...which I will be unveiling today...</i>
<i>...at noon.</i>
<i>Featuring a live appearance
by Baby Brent himself.</i>
<i>What is up, everybody?</i>
<i>- Hey.
- Hey, it's Baby Brent.</i>
<i>What you doing? Stacking cans
with me on them as a baby?</i>
<i>Anyways, who wants to watch me
cut the ribbon...</i>
<i>...at the mayor's unveiling thing?</i>
<i>I'll be using these bad boys
to help save the town.</i>
<i>All right, you guys.
Sardines, yeah.</i>
<i>- Swallow Falls forever!
- What a delight.</i>
<i>Listen, you- Maybe you wanna go
to that unveiling?</i>
<i>You know, Dad, why don't you
go ahead. I'll hold down the fort here.</i>
<i>Really? You sure you can handle it?</i>
<i>Yeah, Dad,
I'm pretty sure I'll be fine.</i>
<i>All right, then.</i>
<i>I'll be back in half an hour, skipper.</i>
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>
<i>This hellhole is too small
for me, Brent.</i>
<i>I wanna be big.</i>
<i>I want people to look at me and say,
"That is one big mayor."</i>
<i>And that's why this has to work.</i>
<i>It has to work.</i>
<i>Otherwise, I'm just a tiny mayor
of a tiny town...</i>
<i>...full of tiny sardine-sucking
knuckle-scrapers.</i>
<i>But not me, right?</i>
<i>Oh, not you, Brent. No.
You've always been like a son to me.</i>
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>
<i>Under this tarp is the greatest tourist
attraction ever built by humans.</i>
<i>We just need 17,000 more gigajoules.</i>
<i>- An attraction so...
- Go, go, go.</i>
<i>What are you doing, Flint Lockwood?</i>
<i>Just holding my hands
behind my back respectfully, sir.</i>
<i>- You know what you are, Lockwood?
- No.</i>
<i>A shenaniganizer.</i>
<i>A tomfool.</i>
<i>- You see my beautiful angel son Cal?
- What's up?</i>
<i>I love him so much.
This is my only son.</i>
<i>I want him to have a bright future.</i>
<i>A future in which you don't ruin
our town's day...</i>
<i>...with one of your
crazy science thingies.</i>
<i>- Well, that's all behind me-
- You see this contact lens, Lockwood?</i>
<i>- This contact lens represent you.
- All right.</i>
<i>- And my eye represents my eye.
- Okay.</i>
<i>I got my eye on you.</i>
<i>- Oh, my gosh, a jaywalker.
- Hey.</i>
<i>And I've arranged for live coverage
from a major network...</i>
<i>...and their most experienced
professional reporter.</i>
<i>Oh, just send the intern.
She's cute, and she's super perky.</i>
<i>Well, those are the only things we look
for in a TV weatherperson. Intern.</i>
<i>How would you like to do a weather
report from a rinky-dink island...</i>
<i>...in the middle of the ocean
as a favour to my cousin?</i>
<i>Really?</i>
<i>Can you believe it, Manny?</i>
<i>Temporary
professional meteorologist.</i>
<i>Okay, Manny, what about this?</i>
<i>Welcome, America,
I'm Sam Sparks.</i>
<i>Hello, America, Sam Sparks here.</i>
<i>America, hi. I didn't see you there.</i>
<i>It's me, Sam Sparks.</i>
<i>On my way across the ocean.</i>
<i>Now, when she gets here,
I wanna see a lot of smiling faces.</i>
<i>Act like, "Hey, whoa."</i>
<i>This is a great idea.</i>
<i>Weather News Network.</i>
<i>Weather news happens...</i>
<i>...or not.</i>
<i>Now we're over to Swallow Falls...</i>
<i>...where our intern
is on her first day on the job.</i>
<i>Or should I say, first gray on the job.</i>
<i>Looks pretty cloudy there, intern.</i>
<i>Hello, Sam Sparks, I'm America.</i>
<i>It's Swallow Falls degrees and-
Well, let's just go to the mayor.</i>
<i>Thank you and welcome,
national television audience.</i>
<i>You are about to witness
an historic event, undoubtedly...</i>
<i>And now, here to cut
the ceremonial ribbon...</i>
<i>...Swallow Falls' favourite son,
Baby Brent!</i>
<i>He's still got it, folks.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>I'm the best person
in the whole town.</i>
<i>Food synthesis, go.</i>
<i>My chest hairs are tingling.
Something's wrong.</i>
<i>Well, here it is. The attraction
the whole world has been waiting for:</i>
<i>Sardine Land.</i>
<i>With rides and exhibits.</i>
<i>And featuring Shamo,
the world's largest sardine...</i>
<i>...and his flaming hoop of glory.</i>
<i>Those of you in the splash zone,
look out.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Cheeseburger.</i>
<i>Flint Lockwood.</i>
<i>Just a second.
I'm in the middle of a-</i>
<i>Well, looks like things in Swallow Falls
are sardine to get better. For-</i>
<i>What just happened to me?</i>
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>You're under arrest, Flint Lockwood.</i>
<i>Thank goodness you only caused
minimal damage to Sardine Land.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>I really shouldn't be running
with these.</i>
<i>Jump, jump, jump, run, run,
jump, jump, run.</i>
<i>- It's a good thing no one got hurt!
- Flint Lockwood!</i>
<i>I didn't get hurt, but that does
not mean that I'm not still mad at you.</i>
<i>Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry.
Are you okay?</i>
<i>- I didn't get a chance to-
- It's okay, it's just pain.</i>
<i>Sorry, I'm not myself today.</i>
<i>My whole career was ruined by some
crazy jerk riding a homemade rocket.</i>
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>What is going on with your feet?</i>
<i>Spray-On Shoes.
They don't come off.</i>
<i>Cool.</i>
<i>This could solve
the untied shoes epidemic.</i>
<i>What are they made of, some kind of
elastic biopolymer adhesive?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Exactly.</i>
<i>I mean...</i>
<i>Wow, they're shiny. I'm Sam.</i>
<i>- Flint.
- Steve.</i>
<i>- Is that a Monkey Thought Translator?
- Steve.</i>
<i>Incredible.
Did you make all of this stuff?</i>
<i>- You hit me with a rocket.
- You kicked me in the face.</i>
<i>I said I was sorry.</i>
<i>Do you know how hard it is
to break into the weather game?</i>
<i>I spent my entire life building up
to that moment.</i>
<i>You get one shot at the show.</i>
<i>And if you don't make it...</i>
<i>...it's back to cleaning
the barometers.</i>
<i>Cheese?</i>
<i>But that could only mean...</i>
<i>Excited. Excited.</i>
<i>My machine works.</i>
<i>It really works!</i>
<i>Your machine?</i>
<i>Is that what that rocket was?</i>
<i>Do you like it?</i>
<i>I love it!</i>
<i>This is just amazing.
Look at this.</i>
<i>This is the greatest weather
phenomenon in history.</i>
<i>Hey, aren't you a weathergirl?</i>
<i>Manny, get your camera.</i>
<i>This just in: Our humiliated weather
intern is apparently back for more.</i>
<i>Thanks, Patrick. Okay, everybody,
you are not gonna believe this one...</i>
<i>...but I am standing
in the middle of a burger rain.</i>
<i>You may have seen
a meteor shower...</i>
<i>...but you've never seen a shower
meatier than this.</i>
<i>For a town stuck eating sardines,
this is totally manna from heaven.</i>
<i>This tastes significantly better
than sardines.</i>
<i>This is going to be big.</i>
<i>This food weather
was created intentionally...</i>
<i>...by meek-ish backyard tinkerer
Flint Lockwood.</i>
<i>Flint Lockwood?</i>
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>You're under arrest
for ruining Sardine Land.</i>
<i>Flint, those burgers were awesome.</i>
<i>The producer called and he was like,
"Everybody loves that food weather."</i>
<i>- Food weather.
- What?</i>
<i>This could be bigger
than Sardine Land.</i>
<i>- Can you make it rain food again?
- No.</i>
<i>- I don't know if I-
- You're gonna do it again?</i>
<i>You gotta be kidding.</i>
<i>Please, please, please.</i>
<i>- Yes.
- No.</i>
<i>- Give me one more chance.
- We know this was an accident.</i>
<i>- I know.
- Cheeseburgers from the sky...</i>
<i>...that's not natural.</i>
<i>My invention could save
the whole town.</i>
<i>You will be so proud of me, Dad.</i>
<i>Plus...</i>
<i>...there's a girl here.</i>
<i>Can you look me in the eye and
tell me you've got this under control...</i>
<i>...and it's not gonna end up
in a disaster?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>I've got this under control,
and it's not gonna end in disaster.</i>
<i>- All right.
- Thanks, Dad.</i>
<i>- Oh, sure.
- Okay. So, Sam...</i>
<i>...this is where the magic happens.</i>
<i>Lick. Lick. Lick.</i>
<i>Lick. Lick. Lick.</i>
<i>Welcome, Flint.</i>
<i>You seriously spend
a lot of time alone.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>So here's how it works.</i>
<i>Water goes in the top,
and food comes out the bottom.</i>
<i>When you shot it
into the stratosphere...</i>
<i>...you figured it would induce a phase
change from the cumulonimbus layer?</i>
<i>That's actually
a really smart observation.</i>
<i>I mean...</i>
<i>The clouds probably have water
in them...</i>
<i>...which, I guess, is why
you shot it up there in the first place.</i>
<i>Right, right. That's why I did that.</i>
<i>- On purpose.
- Right. Yeah.</i>
<i>- Right.
- Of course.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>The machine uses a principle
of hydro-genetic mutation.</i>
<i>Water molecules are bombarded
with microwave radiation...</i>
<i>...which mutates their genetic recipe
into any kind of food you want.</i>
<i>So...</i>
<i>- Pizza?
- Yes.</i>
<i>- Mashed potatoes?
- Yes.</i>
<i>- Peas?
- Yes, that's also a food.</i>
<i>- Steak? Apples?
- Yes.</i>
<i>- Apple sauce? BLT?
- Yes.</i>
<i>- I said any kind of food.
- Chicken wings?</i>
<i>Think about what you're saying,
and if it's a food, yes.</i>
<i>- Baloney.
- Baloney. That is a food.</i>
<i>- How about Jell-O?
- Do you like Jell-O?</i>
<i>I love Jell-O.</i>
<i>I love Jell-O too.
Oh, and peanut butter, right?</i>
<i>Oh, no, no, no,
I am severely allergic to peanuts.</i>
<i>Hey, me too.</i>
<i>- What's it called?
- Peanut allergy.</i>
<i>- No, the machine.
- Of course.</i>
<i>It's called the Flint Lockwood
Diatonic Super-Mutating...</i>
<i>...Dynamic Food Replicator.</i>
<i>Or, for short:</i>
<i>The FLDSMDFR.</i>
<i>Fliminadifiser?</i>
<i>FLDSMDFR.</i>
<i>Fliminubahdibferer?</i>
<i>Fli.</i>
<i>Suh.</i>
<i>Fdiferf.</i>
<i>Manny, make sure you get this.
He's gonna make the food now.</i>
<i>Now?</i>
<i>Well, the thing is, I can't...</i>
<i>...wait to show you
this hilarious Internet video.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>Fight the power!</i>
<i>What is this?</i>
<i>It's so cute.</i>
<i>Pushing. Folding. Connecting.</i>
<i>Taping. Turning.
Painting. Switching.</i>
<i>Staring.</i>
<i>Motivating.</i>
<i>- Placing button.
- I can't believe I've been watching this...</i>
<i>...for three hours.
- I know.</i>
<i>It's working.</i>
<i>What do you guys want for breakfast?</i>
<i>- Gummi Bears.
- Whoa, Steve, no.</i>
<i>We both know how you get
around Gummi Bears.</i>
<i>How about...</i>
<i>...eggs.
- And toast.</i>
<i>Orange juice.</i>
<i>- And bacon.
- Bacon.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>
<i>To the computer.</i>
<i>So you're sure this is safe?</i>
<i>Don't worry. I have a Dangeometer
that lets us know...</i>
<i>...if the food is going
to over-mutate.</i>
<i>What happens
if the food over-mutates?</i>
<i>I don't know.
But that'll never happen.</i>
<i>All right, this probably
won't explode.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>Bacon.</i>
<i>Those cheeseburgers
were only the beginning...</i>
<i>...because a breakfast system
is on its way to Swallow Falls.</i>
<i>My forecast?</i>
<i>Sunny side up.</i>
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>
<i>Flint, my boy. Can you do lunch?</i>
<i>All right, here's the skinny:</i>
<i>You keep making it rain
the snackadoos...</i>
<i>...weathergirl provides
free advertising...</i>
<i>...I have taken out
a very high-interest loan...</i>
<i>...to convert this Podunk town
into a tourist food-topia.</i>
<i>All you have to do is make it rain food
three meals a day...</i>
<i>...every day
for the foreseeable future...</i>
<i>...and in 30 days we hold a grand
reopening of the island...</i>
<i>...as a must-see cruise destination.</i>
<i>And everyone, everywhere...</i>
<i>...is going to love your invention.</i>
<i>Do you think so?</i>
<i>I know so.</i>
<i>Now that's what I call
poultry in motion.</i>
<i>Mr. Lockwood,
may I please have waffles?</i>
<i>- Falafels?
- Jellybeans.</i>
<i>- Avocado.
- Coming right up.</i>
<i>Leftovers?</i>
<i>Not a problem with Flint Lockwood's
latest invention, the Outtasighter...</i>
<i>...so-named because it catapults
uneaten food out of sight...</i>
<i>...and therefore, out of mind.</i>
<i>Jellybeans!</i>
<i>Awesome.</i>
<i>- BLT.
- Doughnuts.</i>
<i>Pie.</i>
<i>Gummi bears.</i>
<i>- Fish.
- Crème brûlée!</i>
<i>A pizza stuffed inside a turkey...</i>
<i>...the whole thing deep-fried
and dipped in chocolate.</i>
<i>It's me, the mayor.</i>
<i>You look different.</i>
<i>Did you get a new haircut?</i>
<i>Yes, I did. Thank you for noticing.</i>
<i>- I love you. - Thanks, Dad. I love you.
- I love you. - Thanks, Dad. I love you.</i>
<i>I love spending time with you, Dad.</i>
<i>Hey, Dad, I'm headed back
to the lab.</i>
<i>If you wanna come,
I could show you how I make the food.</i>
<i>No, thanks.</i>
<i>That techno-food, it's too complicated
for an old fisherman.</i>
<i>Got it.</i>
<i>Could still use your help around here,
though, you know.</i>
<i>I'm working
with the mayor now, Dad.</i>
<i>I mean, the town's grand reopening
is in, like, a week.</i>
<i>Right. Got it.</i>
<i>Flint Lockwood?</i>
<i>Yeah?</i>
<i>It's my son Cal's birthday
tomorrow...</i>
<i>...and I was just wondering if you
could make it rain something special.</i>
<i>Well, I'm pretty backed up
on requests.</i>
<i>Plus, you're always mean to me.</i>
<i>It'll be just one time...</i>
<i>...for my special angel's special day.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>You know, I don't wanna
overwork the machine, so...</i>
<i>Okay. I knew it was a long shot.</i>
<i>I just wanted Cal to see how much
his father loves him.</i>
<i>I thought you would understand.</i>
<i>You know how fathers always trying
to express...</i>
<i>...their love and appreciation
for their sons.</i>
<i>Earl, wait.</i>
<i>Touch. Touch. Touch.</i>
<i>I've got an idea.</i>
<i>Happy birthday, son.</i>
<i>Dad?</i>
<i>This is your day. Go have fun.</i>
<i>- I love you guys. You're awesome.
- I love you too, son.</i>
<i>- Have a good time, baby.
- Ice cream!</i>
<i>Yeah! Cool.</i>
<i>Strawberry's my favourite.</i>
<i>Come on, Dad.</i>
<i>I don't know, Cal.</i>
<i>This doesn't look safe!</i>
<i>I love you, son.</i>
<i>I know, Dad. You tell me every day.</i>
<i>Flint, this is amazing.</i>
<i>And designing the ice cream
to accumulate into scoops...</i>
<i>...I don't know how
you're gonna top this.</i>
<i>Maybe with hot fudge.</i>
<i>Hey, Flint.</i>
<i>You wanna be in a snowball fight
with us?</i>
<i>Flint, what's the problem?</i>
<i>I've never actually been
in a snowball fight.</i>
<i>- Really?
- I don't even know the rules.</i>
<i>Is there like a point system or is it...</i>
<i>...to the death?
- No-</i>
<i>You've nev-? I mean, look, even
Steve is throwing chocolate snowballs.</i>
<i>So like this?</i>
<i>No, harder than that.</i>
<i>Snowball.
Snowball, snowball, snowball.</i>
<i>Snowball. Snowball.</i>
<i>Well, something to be said
for enthusiasm.</i>
<i>Snowball!</i>
<i>Snowball!</i>
<i>Snowball and snowball.</i>
<i>Kids? What's going on?</i>
<i>Snowball.</i>
<i>- Snowball.
- Snowball. Snowball.</i>
<i>I scream, you scream...</i>
<i>...we all scream for Flint Lockwood's
latest tasty town-wide treat...</i>
<i>...with flurries of frozen fun
on what the mayor declared to be...</i>
<i>...an ice cream snow day.</i>
<i>He'd also like to invite everyone
in the world to catch a cruise liner...</i>
<i>...and come on down
this Saturday...</i>
<i>...for the grand opening
of Chew And Swallow...</i>
<i>...a town that is truly à la mode.</i>
<i>A town that is truly
topped with ice cream.</i>
<i>With today's scoop
for the Weather News Network...</i>
<i>...I'm Sam Sparks.</i>
<i>Flint, this is the best breakfast ever.</i>
<i>That's it!</i>
<i>Researching. Role-playing.</i>
<i>Dialing.</i>
<i>Waiting.</i>
<i>- Sam Sparks.
- Hanging up.</i>
<i>Regretting. Re-psyching.</i>
<i>Saying what I'm doing.</i>
<i>- Flint?
- "Hi, Sam, how are you? That's nice.</i>
<i>I was wondering if you would like
to go on a da-"</i>
<i>Activity with me tomorrow.</i>
<i>- Okay.
- Great, bye. Meet me in the forest.</i>
<i>Nailed it. Gotta go, Steve.</i>
<i>Keep an eye on the lab for me.</i>
<i>Steve.</i>
<i>Foster still at the plate.</i>
<i>And nobody out.</i>
<i>Where are we going?</i>
<i>Oh, nowhere.
I just thought it'd be nice...</i>
<i>...for the two of us
to go on a walk together.</i>
<i>Like you do as friends.</i>
<i>Oh, my, what's that?</i>
<i>Jell-O's my favourite.</i>
<i>You never made a request, so...</i>
<i>...I made one for you.</i>
<i>Flint?</i>
<i>Flint?</i>
<i>Join me.</i>
<i>But how did you-?</i>
<i>I made it rain Jell-O, then I gathered
it up with the Outtasighter...</i>
<i>...and then I brought it here
and pressed it...</i>
<i>...into a gigantic custom-carved plastic
Tupperware mold I made. No big deal.</i>
<i>Everything's made of Jell-O.</i>
<i>This piano, those sconces...</i>
<i>...that ghetto blaster, that Jell-O,
that aquarium...</i>
<i>...that Venus de Milo
with your face on it...</i>
<i>...next to a Michelangelo's David
that also has your face.</i>
<i>Come on, Sam,
what are you waiting for?</i>
<i>Nothing!</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Cannonball.</i>
<i>Belly flop.</i>
<i>Why did I do that?</i>
<i>- So Jell-O.
- Right. Right, right.</i>
<i>It's a solid, it's a liquid...</i>
<i>...it's a visco-elastic polymer made of
polypeptide chains, but you eat it.</i>
<i>I mean...</i>
<i>...it tastes good.</i>
<i>- Why do you do that?
- Do what?</i>
<i>Say something super smart
and then bail from it.</i>
<i>Can you keep a secret?</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>But this time, sure, yeah.</i>
<i>Okay. Well, it was a really
long time ago, but I, too, was...</i>
<i>...a nerd.</i>
<i>Too?</i>
<i>When I was a little girl...</i>
<i>...I wore a ponytail, I had glasses...</i>
<i>...and I was totally obsessed
with the science of weather.</i>
<i>Other girls wanted a Barbie.</i>
<i>I wanted a Doppler Weather
Radar 2000 Turbo.</i>
<i>But all the kids used to taunt me
with this lame song.</i>
<i>It wasn't even clever.</i>
<i>Four-eyes, four-eyes</i>
<i>You need glasses to see</i>
<i>Go on.</i>
<i>So I got a new look...</i>
<i>...gave up the science-y
smart stuff...</i>
<i>...and I was never
made fun of again.</i>
<i>And I still need these glasses,
but I never wear them.</i>
<i>- I'll bet you look great with glasses on.
- I'm not-</i>
<i>And on they go.</i>
<i>- What?
- Nothing.</i>
<i>Wait.</i>
<i>It's a Jell-O scrunchie.</i>
<i>And now, the reveal.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>
<i>I mean, you were okay before...</i>
<i>...but now...</i>
<i>...you're beautiful.</i>
<i>No, I'm not. I can't go out in public
like this.</i>
<i>Well, why not?</i>
<i>I mean, this is the real you, right?</i>
<i>Smart.</i>
<i>Bespectacled.</i>
<i>Who wouldn't wanna see that?</i>
<i>You know, I've never met anyone
like you, Flint Lockwood.</i>
<i>Me either.</i>
<i>But about you.</i>
<i>Flint, you have a call</i>
<i>Flint, you have a call</i>
<i>Is your phone ringing?</i>
<i>That's weird.
Someone must've changed my ring.</i>
<i>Oh, it's the mayor.
Do you mind if I take this?</i>
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>- Go ahead, take it. That's fine.
- I'm sorry. It's important.</i>
<i>- I should be going too. It's getting late.
- I'm just gonna step outside.</i>
<i>Dad, you came.
I have so much to tell you.</i>
<i>- Do I look all right?
- You look great. Come on, let's go.</i>
<i>Dad, I almost kissed a girl.</i>
<i>- It's Baby Brent, you know?
- It was the coolest thing- Hi.</i>
<i>- I should be on the list.
- Hey, Brian.</i>
<i>What? You're letting that guy in?
That guy's a nerd.</i>
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>
<i>Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you.</i>
<i>A toast.
To Flint and his delicious steaks.</i>
<i>- Oh, thanks. Thank you.
- Very nice place.</i>
<i>Oh, wow. Thank you.</i>
<i>- Flint Lockwood.
- Earl.</i>
<i>So no roof.</i>
<i>Yep. You just hold out your plate.</i>
<i>And I even made it rain
your favourite:</i>
<i>Meat.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>So you know how the grand reopening
of the town is tomorrow?</i>
<i>Well, the mayor has asked me
to cut the ribbon.</i>
<i>He said my invention
saved the town.</i>
<i>Aren't you proud of me?</i>
<i>Well...</i>
<i>...doesn't this steak look
a little big to you?</i>
<i>Yeah, it's a big steak. I mean, every
steak is not exactly the same size.</i>
<i>Did you even hear what I just said?</i>
<i>Son, look around.</i>
<i>I'm not sure this is good for people.</i>
<i>Maybe you should think about
turning this thing off.</i>
<i>It's making everybody happy.</i>
<i>Everybody except you.</i>
<i>When are you gonna accept
that this is who I am...</i>
<i>...instead of trying to get me to work
in some boring tackle shop?</i>
<i>Well...</i>
<i>...you seem like you know
what you're doing, then.</i>
<i>I guess I'll just get out of your way.</i>
<i>Get with the times, man.</i>
<i>I mean, there's no pleasing
that guy.</i>
<i>He just wants to take anything good
I do and just smoosh it.</i>
<i>These are big hot dogs.</i>
<i>Man.</i>
<i>I mean, this isn't that bad.</i>
<i>- Is it, Steve?
- Yellow.</i>
<i>You're right, Steve.</i>
<i>The Dangeometer is in the yellow.</i>
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>
<i>I do...</i>
<i>...declare these hot dogs
to be delicious!</i>
<i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>How did you get in here?</i>
<i>Tomorrow's the big day, Flint.</i>
<i>The entire town's fate is resting
on your food weather.</i>
<i>I'm thinking pasta.</i>
<i>Some light apps.
I know you won't let us down.</i>
<i>Well, Mr. Mayor, I think there's
something you should see.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>This is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell last week.</i>
<i>And this is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell today.</i>
<i>The machine uses
microwave radiation...</i>
<i>...to mutate the genetic recipe
of the food.</i>
<i>The more we ask it to make,
the more clouds it takes in...</i>
<i>...the more radiation it emits, the more
these molecules could over-mutate.</i>
<i>I think that's why the food
is getting bigger.</i>
<i>Here's what I heard:</i>
<i>"Science, science, science, bigger."</i>
<i>And bigger is better.</i>
<i>Everyone's gonna love
these new portion sizes.</i>
<i>I know I do.</i>
<i>My dad thinks I should turn it off.</i>
<i>Geniuses like us are never understood
by their fathers, Flint.</i>
<i>But what if things go-</i>
<i>Who needs the approval
of one family member...</i>
<i>...when you can have it
from millions of acquaintances?</i>
<i>Not to mention that little cutlet,
Sam Sparks.</i>
<i>And me.</i>
<i>I've always felt that you were
like a son to me, Flint.</i>
<i>And I'm gonna be so proud of you
tomorrow when you cut that ribbon...</i>
<i>...save the town...</i>
<i>...and prove to everybody
what a great inventor you are.</i>
<i>So here's the cheese:</i>
<i>You can keep it going...</i>
<i>...get everything
you've ever wanted...</i>
<i>...and be the great man
I know you can be.</i>
<i>Or you can turn it off...</i>
<i>...ruin everything...</i>
<i>...and no one will ever like you.</i>
<i>It's your choice.</i>
<i>Choice.</i>
<i>Choice.</i>
<i>Choice.</i>
<i>Choice.</i>
<i>Choice.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>I mean, bigger is better...</i>
<i>...right?</i>
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>Spaghetti. Asparagus. Celery.
Garlic bread. Meatball. Shrimp.</i>
<i>- Looks safe to me.
- And sanitary too.</i>
<i>Who's hungry?</i>
<i>Welcome, tourists,
to Chew And Swallow.</i>
<i>That is one big mayor.</i>
<i>Delight in our nacho-cheese
hot springs.</i>
<i>Allow your kids to eat
all the junk food they want...</i>
<i>...in our completely
unsupervised Kid Zone!</i>
<i>I've got jellybeans for teeth.</i>
<i>And when the fun is done...</i>
<i>...gaze upon the sunset
cresting over Mount Leftovers.</i>
<i>From which we're protected
by a presumably indestructible dam.</i>
<i>We've got people here today
from all around the world...</i>
<i>...from as far as China
to West Virginia.</i>
<i>Also I think there's
some Canadians here.</i>
<i>- You need to look at this.
- Why aren't you on TV?</i>
<i>You're supposed
to be broadcasting this.</i>
<i>There's a problem.
The food's getting bigger.</i>
<i>I know, it's great. Bigger portion sizes.
Everyone loves it.</i>
<i>I'm not sure we're doing
the right thing here.</i>
<i>What if we've bitten off more
than we can chew?</i>
<i>For the first time in my life, everybody
loves something that I've done.</i>
<i>Why can't you just be
happy for me...</i>
<i>...and go say the weather
or something. Jeez.</i>
<i>And without further ado...</i>
<i>...our town's hero
and my metaphorical son...</i>
<i>...Flint Lockwood.</i>
<i>Yeah, Flint.</i>
<i>Thank you. Thank you, everyone.</i>
<i>- Sign my shrimp.
- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Yeah. Yeah.
- I love you.</i>
<i>I admire your quirkiness, dude.</i>
<i>Brent, we're gonna need you
to hand over the ceremonial scissors.</i>
<i>But-</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>- You can't. You can't take them. No.
- Here you go.</i>
<i>I'm Baby Brent.</i>
<i>Put your clothes back on.</i>
<i>Who am I?</i>
<i>Go ahead, Flint.</i>
<i>Everybody loves you.</i>
<i>Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!</i>
<i>Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!</i>
<i>Danger. Danger. Danger.</i>
<i>Salt-and-pepper wind?</i>
<i>Oregano.</i>
<i>Sam, wait. No, I can turn it off.</i>
<i>I can turn it off.</i>
<i>All right, kid, it's all gonna be okay.</i>
<i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.</i>
<i>- Excuse me.
- No problem.</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>- Gummi Bears.
- Not now, Steve.</i>
<i>Condiments? Salt? Pepper?</i>
<i>Flint.</i>
<i>This is Sam Sparks,
live from Chew And Swallow...</i>
<i>...where a spaghetti twister-</i>
<i>Sam, hey, we love a good storm
over here, but you look like a nerd.</i>
<i>Patrick, several children are stranded
in the path of this tomato tornado.</i>
<i>My tummy hurts.</i>
<i>Cal.</i>
<i>What is that, a scrunchie? I haven't
seen one of those since 1995.</i>
<i>What? We have
an actual weather emergency.</i>
<i>Well, we'll get right back
to that storm...</i>
<i>...and hopefully Sam'll look
a little more appealing.</i>
<i>Steve, we just have to upload the kill
code and then we'll shut down the-</i>
<i>What are you doing here?</i>
<i>I've been ordering dinner
for the last 10 minutes.</i>
<i>- Is something going on?
- I've gotta stop the machine.</i>
<i>Everyone's in danger
because of me.</i>
<i>Oh, it can't be that bad.</i>
<i>- No.
- Well, I'm out of here.</i>
<i>I can still stop the order
with the kill code.</i>
<i>- Sending kill code.
- I'm back.</i>
<i>Got to get the button.</i>
<i>Play. Fun. Fun. Play.</i>
<i>Hey, Flint. It's been nice
to beet you.</i>
<i>That's a radish.</i>
<i>That was the only way
to communicate with the machine.</i>
<i>What exactly did you order?</i>
<i>A Vegas-style all-you-can-eat buffet.</i>
<i>Jellybean. Watermelon.
Marshmallow. Pretzel. Sushi.</i>
<i>Cheeseburger. Pretzel. Egg salad.
Strawberry. Marshmallow.</i>
<i>Strawberry.</i>
<i>- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.</i>
<i>Help, somebody.</i>
<i>Help me, please.</i>
<i>It's my son.</i>
<i>We need a doctor.</i>
<i>Is anyone here a doctor? Anyone?</i>
<i>I am a doctor.</i>
<i>You are?</i>
<i>I was, back in Guatemala.</i>
<i>I came here for a better life.</i>
<i>Pretty great decision, eh?</i>
<i>How is he, doc?</i>
<i>He's in a food coma.</i>
<i>Too much junk food.</i>
<i>I need a celery, stat.</i>
<i>Here you go.</i>
<i>- Daddy?
- Oh, Cal. Cal.</i>
<i>I love you, son.</i>
<i>Looks like everything
turned out okay.</i>
<i>Not yet, it hasn't.</i>
<i>That twister was an amuse-bouche
compared to what's on the way.</i>
<i>- What's an amuse-bouche?
- Manny, patch us through.</i>
<i>Go.</i>
<i>Cute report, Nancy.
Hey. Hey. Four-eyes.</i>
<i>Can it, Patrick.</i>
<i>We are about to be in the epicentre
of a perfect food storm.</i>
<i>It's going to spread
across the globe.</i>
<i>I've calculated the Coriolis
acceleration of the storm system.</i>
<i>First, it'll hit New York...</i>
<i>...then Paris...</i>
<i>...then the Jiayuguan Pass
in eastern China.</i>
<i>And in four hours the entire northern
hemisphere will be one big potluck.</i>
<i>Flint?</i>
<i>Flint?</i>
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Well, I tried to help everybody...</i>
<i>...but instead I ruined everything.</i>
<i>I'm just a piece of junk.</i>
<i>So I threw myself away.</i>
<i>Along with all these
dumb inventions.</i>
<i>This is junk.</i>
<i>This is junk.</i>
<i>This is junk.</i>
<i>Oh, son. Listen, when your boat is,
when it's listing...</i>
<i>...and if it's not running,
you know-</i>
<i>Don't worry, Dad, I get it.</i>
<i>Mom was wrong about me.</i>
<i>I'm not an inventor.</i>
<i>I should've just quit when you said.</i>
<i>Well...</i>
<i>...when it rains, you put on a coat.</i>
<i>Dad, you know I don't understand
fishing metaphors-</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>My coat.</i>
<i>Come on, Steve.
We've got diem to carpe.</i>
<i>Kill code downloading.</i>
<i>Redesigning. Virtualizing.</i>
<i>Cutting.</i>
<i>Welding. Forging.</i>
<i>- Wiring.
- Helping.</i>
<i>Testing.</i>
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Flying Car 2.</i>
<i>Now with wings.</i>
<i>Hey, I had a weird dream
like this once.</i>
<i>I have a macaroni
on my head.</i>
<i>Run.</i>
<i>No school!</i>
<i>Still nothing, nothing in the bottom of
the third inning.</i>
<i>Everyone.</i>
<i>I want to apologize.</i>
<i>Especially to you, Sam.</i>
<i>But I have a plan.</i>
<i>This flash drive contains a kill code.</i>
<i>I will fly up into that food storm,
plug it into the machine...</i>
<i>...and shut it down forever...</i>
<i>...while you guys evacuate
the island, using bread</i>
<i>This is all his fault. Get him.</i>
<i>There he is! Get him!</i>
<i>Get Flint.</i>
<i>Let's rock his car back and forth.</i>
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>This mess we're in
is all our faults.</i>
<i>Me, I didn't even protect
my own son.</i>
<i>Look, I'm as mad at Flint as you are.</i>
<i>In fact, when he gets out of that car,
I'm gonna slap him in the face.</i>
<i>I know Flint Lockwood made the food,
but it was made-to-order.</i>
<i>And now it's time for all of us
to pay the bill.</i>
<i>Thank you, Earl.</i>
<i>- Sorry.
- It's okay.</i>
<i>- Let's go build some boats.
- Yeah.</i>
<i>I'm gonna go build a boat.</i>
<i>I'm coming with you.</i>
<i>You're gonna need someone
to navigate you through that storm.</i>
<i>I can't let you do this alone.</i>
<i>- Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.
- Are you kidding?</i>
<i>- Well, I just thought that we-
- No.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>- You are going to need a co-pilot.
- You're a pilot too?</i>
<i>Yes. I am also a particle physicist.</i>
<i>- Really?
- No, that was a joke.</i>
<i>I am also a comedian.</i>
<i>- Let's do this thing.
- I'm coming too.</i>
<i>Brent, that's okay.</i>
<i>No, it's not okay.</i>
<i>I've been coasting on my fame
since I was a baby.</i>
<i>But it was all just an illusion.</i>
<i>Maybe up there
I'll find out who I really am.</i>
<i>The car's pretty full, so...</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Brent.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Good luck, son.</i>
<i>Steve.</i>
<i>Pea-soup fog.</i>
<i>Manny, hit the wipers.</i>
<i>There's massive gastro-precipitation
accumulated around the machine.</i>
<i>It's almost as if it's...</i>
<i>Inside a giant meatball.</i>
<i>Water goes in the top...</i>
<i>...a food hurricane
comes out the bottom.</i>
<i>Glad I'm wearing a diaper.</i>
<i>Anybody order pizza?</i>
<i>Hold on.</i>
<i>The pizza's chasing us?</i>
<i>Sentient food? That's impossible.</i>
<i>Unless its molecular structure's
mutated into super food!</i>
<i>That's been genetically engineered
to protect the FLDSMDFR.</i>
<i>Pizza.</i>
<i>Pizza. Pizza. Pizza.</i>
<i>That was close. I mean, can you
imagine if we lost this kill code?</i>
<i>- Tim's Tackle Shop.
- Dad.</i>
<i>You're okay, great.</i>
<i>I need a favour. The fate of the world
depends on it!</i>
<i>Okay, then, skipper.
What do you need?</i>
<i>Go into my lab, get on my computer
and e-mail a file to my cell phone.</i>
<i>All right.</i>
<i>- Want me to drive?
- Yeah, okay.</i>
<i>You're a lot better than me.</i>
<i>Okay, here's the plan:</i>
<i>Sam and I will enter the meteoroid
through the intake here...</i>
<i>...which should lead us straight
to the FLDSMDFR.</i>
<i>Manny, you and Steve stay on the
plane. Don't spray that.</i>
<i>Once my dad e-mails me the kill code,
we'll destroy the machine...</i>
<i>...and rendezvous
at the western blowhole in-</i>
<i>- How long until the world's destroyed?
- Twenty minutes.</i>
<i>Just before then.</i>
<i>What about me, Brent?
What do I do?</i>
<i>You can be president
of the back seat.</i>
<i>Deploy hatch.</i>
<i>Car upside down, go.</i>
<i>Ladies first?</i>
<i>No?</i>
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Wait for me.</i>
<i>Great. Okay, I'm good.</i>
<i>As long as we stay on course,
it should be a straight shot to the-</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>
<i>We're a team.</i>
<i>We've landed here
in some kind of exhaust vent.</i>
<i>If we go this way, the Flamidabager
should be right down this air shaft.</i>
<i>Brent, get out of that pie.</i>
<i>What's that?</i>
<i>Oh, boy.</i>
<i>Welcome, Flint.</i>
<i>That's fry oil.</i>
<i>Flint, you have a call.</i>
<i>Flint, you have a-</i>
<i>Dad. Oh, okay, great.</i>
<i>On the screen there's a file
marked "kill code."</i>
<i>- What-?
- Move that into my e-mail window...</i>
<i>...type in my name, and press send.</i>
<i>- Window?
- Okay, Dad...</i>
<i>...you see the thing that looks like
a little piece of paper?</i>
<i>Use the mouse to drag it.</i>
<i>- Drag it? Drag it.
- Drag it. Drag it.</i>
<i>Right? Okay. Great. Okay, great.</i>
<i>It's not dragging.</i>
<i>Drag it across the desktop.</i>
<i>- That didn't do anything.
- Of course it didn't! You know what?</i>
<i>Go, go, go.</i>
<i>Hoist those sails. Toast that bread.</i>
<i>We are running out of time.</i>
<i>Let's move out. Go, go, go.</i>
<i>We can do it.
Come on, move it, move it.</i>
<i>Good job. That's what I'm talking
about. Everybody head to the docks.</i>
<i>Wait, wait.</i>
<i>I have an important announcement.</i>
<i>See you, suckers.</i>
<i>Bon voyage.</i>
<i>And bon appétit.</i>
<i>- Cal.
- Calvin.</i>
<i>Cal, get back here.</i>
<i>- Foodalanche.
- Cal.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna lose you again.</i>
<i>Baby.</i>
<i>Hold on tight, Calvin.</i>
<i>Everybody head south.
We gotta stay ahead of that storm.</i>
<i>- Now what?
- Just click "send."</i>
<i>Flint, the Fliminadifiserser's
right down there!</i>
<i>- Dad, hurry.
- Send. Send.</i>
<i>Oh, wait.</i>
<i>Dad? Dad? Can you hear me?</i>
<i>Dad?</i>
<i>Hey, guys?</i>
<i>Holy crap balls.</i>
<i>Go, go, go.</i>
<i>I don't know.
I think they're kind of cute.</i>
<i>I mean, this one just walked
right up to me and-</i>
<i>He's got me!</i>
<i>- They ate Brent.
- They ate Brent.</i>
<i>Dad, I'm surrounded
by man-eating chickens right now.</i>
<i>So if this is goodbye...</i>
<i>...thanks for trying
to set me straight.</i>
<i>Figured it out a little late, I guess.</i>
<i>Okay, bye.</i>
<i>Dad.</i>
<i>Hey, give me that phone back.</i>
<i>Baby Brent?</i>
<i>I'm not Baby Brent anymore.</i>
<i>I'm Chicken Brent.</i>
<i>And I'm finally contributing
to society.</i>
<i>Crotch kick.</i>
<i>Now go, you crazy kids,
and save the world.</i>
<i>You did it, Chicken Brent.
You really did it.</i>
<i>Go, go, go.</i>
<i>It should be right down this hole.</i>
<i>That's peanut brittle.</i>
<i>If either one of us touches it,
we'll go into anaphylactic shock.</i>
<i>Actually, I'm not entirely allergic
to peanuts.</i>
<i>I might have just said that
to get you to like me.</i>
<i>So you really thought having allergies
would make you more attractive?</i>
<i>Mustache.</i>
<i>Mus-</i>
<i>- Sesame bagel.
- Hey, taxi.</i>
<i>- Taxi.
- Taxi.</i>
<i>I asked for extra mustard.</i>
<i>I was right.</i>
<i>Hot tea?</i>
<i>Did he say hot tea?</i>
<i>"You are about to be crushed
by a giant corn."</i>
<i>Run.</i>
<i>It looks like the food storm
is following an unusual pattern...</i>
<i>...of hitting the world's
famous landmarks first...</i>
<i>...and is now spreading
to the rest of the globe.</i>
<i>What the what?</i>
<i>Hurry up, guys.</i>
<i>After I plug my phone into
the FLDSMDFR and destroy it...</i>
<i>...I'll tug on the liquorice twice
and you'll pull me back up, okay?</i>
<i>Sounds great.</i>
<i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>You got cut, didn't you?</i>
<i>It's just a scratch.</i>
<i>Brent, you need to take Sam back to
the plane to get her an allergy shot.</i>
<i>Just a second.</i>
<i>What? No.</i>
<i>- Let go, Sam.
- I'm not gonna let you go.</i>
<i>Flint, you'll be stuck down there.</i>
<i>It's not ideal, no.</i>
<i>Come with us. We'll start over.</i>
<i>We'll live underground.
Use bacon for clothes.</i>
<i>Sam, that's not a very good plan.</i>
<i>It is if it means
I don't have to lose you.</i>
<i>Look, I like you, okay?</i>
<i>Like- Like, as a friend?</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>Like, "like you" like you.</i>
<i>Me too.</i>
<i>But about you.</i>
<i>Goodbye, Sam.</i>
<i>Flint. No.</i>
<i>Hang on, Sam.</i>
<i>Dr. Manny's got the medicine
for your face.</i>
<i>Pickles.</i>
<i>Beets.</i>
<i>Banana.</i>
<i>Strawberry.</i>
<i>- Manny, we're on our way. Hurry.
- Hang on, Sam.</i>
<i>I'm circling the blowhole.</i>
<i>Scared.</i>
<i>Gummi Bears.</i>
<i>Play with us, play with us.
Eat us, eat us.</i>
<i>Hungry.</i>
<i>Hungry. Gummi Bears. Gummi Bears.
Gummi Bears. Steve hungry. Hungry.</i>
<i>Steve starving. Hungry.
Hungry. Starving.</i>
<i>Manny. Where are you?</i>
<i>- She touched a peanut or something.
- Oh, boy.</i>
<i>Corn.</i>
<i>Grabbing.</i>
<i>Tying. Throwing.</i>
<i>Waiting.</i>
<i>Swinging.</i>
<i>Sorry, old friend.
The kitchen's closed.</i>
<i>Fight the power!</i>
<i>Dad.</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>When it rains, you put on a coat...</i>
<i>...of Spray-On Shoes.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Just- There were chickens-</i>
<i>Where's Flint?</i>
<i>No!</i>
<i>I know, kid.</i>
<i>I know.</i>
<i>- Cool.
- Yeah. All right.</i>
<i>Flint?</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Your son was a great man.</i>
<i>- Steve.
- Steve.</i>
<i>- Flint.
- Brent.</i>
<i>- Flint.
- Cal.</i>
<i>- Steve.
- Flint.</i>
<i>- Earl.
- Flint.</i>
<i>- You guy.
- Steve.</i>
<i>Sam.</i>
<i>Flint.</i>
<i>Sam.</i>
<i>- Flint.
- Flint.</i>
<i>- Dad.
- Steve.</i>
<i>Flint.</i>
<i>Look, when you-
When you cast your line...</i>
<i>...if it's not straight-</i>
<i>Oh, for crying out loud.</i>
<i>I'm proud of you, Flint.</i>
<i>I'm amazed that someone
as ordinary as me...</i>
<i>...could be the father of someone
as extraordinary as you.</i>
<i>You're talented,
you're a total original.</i>
<i>And your lab is breathtaking.</i>
<i>Your mom, she always knew
you were going to be special.</i>
<i>And if she were alive today,
she'd tell us both:</i>
<i>"I told you so."</i>
<i>Now, look,
when I take this thing off...</i>
<i>...and you hear me
make a fishing metaphor...</i>
<i>...just know
that fishing metaphor means:</i>
<i>I love my son.</i>
<i>I love you too, Dad.</i>
<i>So where were we?</i>
<i>You were about to kiss me.</i>
<i>Were you gonna kiss me back?</i>
<i>Why don't you find out?</i>
<i>Because I don't want to go for it and
then get shut down again.</i>
<i>- Just kiss me.
- You know-</i>
<i>Yeah. I'm a chicken.</i>
<i>This was not well thought out.</i>
