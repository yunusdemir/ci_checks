I was just admiring the Volga.
I never get tired of looking at it.
I would be honored if you could go
to the theatre with me tomorrow.
They're playing "Camille"
with Madame Smelskaya in the lead.
Thank you, but my mother and I
have already been invited.
May I ask who invited you?
Mister Paratov.
And you're going?
Of course, we are.
My second daughter's going away.
Be sure you look after her, Prince.
There's no need for you to worry.
I'll lay the whole of Tiflis
at your daughter's feet.
And where does he come from,
this Caucasian?
Some officer brought him
to the Ogoudalovs.
As soon as the little prince saw
Olga he got weak in the knees.
For two weeks he kept his hand on
his dagger so no one'd come near her.
Mama dear, where are you
sending me to?
Everything will be all right.
He's a nobleman
and he's in love with you.
He's a stranger, I know,
we can't help it, darling.
There's no one among our own
who would take you without money.
- Oh, mama...
- It will be all right.
- Where are you going, Excellency?
- I'm in a hurry, dear.
But you can't! Stop!
It's forbidden!
Where are you going,
your Excellency?
Whoa!
You're not allowed to ride
horses on the wharf!
You'll have to excuse me, I'm late.
Take my horse.
I'm sorry. Sorry...
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen!
I'm sorry I'm late, auntie.
Congratulations.
- I wish you happiness.
- Thank you, Sergey Sergeyevich.
Why be jealous?
A great horseman like you is taking
such a lovely girl from us.
Those drunken idiots of mine let
the "Tsarevich" run aground.
It took three tugs to pull her out.
But we did it.
I always feel sad on a pier. Other
people go places and I stay behind.
Shall I take you somewhere?
This very instant!
Just say a word...
You're absolutely crazy!
Come on, make up your mind.
Don't you have the courage?
All ashore!
Why are you crying, mother?
Come visit us in Tiflis.
Don't forget me!
Be sure to write, Olga!
Write to me, Larissa!
There will always be room in our
house for all of you!
Sergey Sergeyevich, your "Swallow"
is coming alongside.
She's a beauty! Would you
be interested in selling her?
Never! My "Swallow"
is the fastest on the Volga.
What do you need the speed for?
You carry only cargo.
I plan to add a passenger service
to the cargo one.
Yes, with money you can do good
business. Happy is the man
who has a lot of money.
I recently read "The New Plutarch,
or the Lives of Great Women".
Larissa Dmitrievna, can you
explain to me
why women usually prefer
evil men
instead of those who are decent?
Do you mean anyone in particular?
No. I was just curious.
Please, Larissa Dmitrievna.
Back up.
Come closer.
- Come closer.
- Go forward, I said.
There's only one way to do it.
It's done.
Allow me, Larissa Dmitrievna.
Thank you, Sergey Sergeyevich.
Watch out, you may break your neck
staring.
He's no man for you.
However he may please you.
It won't do you any good to stare,
Yuli Kapitonovich. She's not for you.
- Well, farewell, gentlemen.
- Good luck to you!
Paratov likes to live in style.
I'm not sure about other things
but style he's got.
You shortchanged me again.
I save your every kopeck, ma'am.
You're ten kopecks short.
Oh mother, don't let those trifles
upset you.
Prices have gone wild in the market.
Don't you teach me about the market.
I'll open up myself.
Why didn't you try to bargain?
Are you too proud for that?
Coming! Everyone's so impatient.
Kharita Ignatievna,
how are you?
Congratulations on your daughter's
birthday.
I was present when they sorted
the telegrams. Here they are...
It's from Anna in Monte Carlo
and Olga in Tiflis.
Surely for Larissa's birthday.
I brought them personally to make
sure they won't be late.
And where's Larissa Dmitrievna?
She's very busy.
We expect you for dinner.
I'll be here.
Well, goodbye.
- From Olga for your birthday.
- Ah, let me see.
They all got home alright.
And this is from Anna.
From Monte Carlo. We haven't
heard from her for a year.
"Mama, I'm having difficulties...
My husband has been accused of
cheating in gambling.
We've got no money to pay for
the hotel, nor for returning home.
Can you send us 700 rubles?
Help us, I beg you. Anna."
I can't believe it!
And I was sure that with a foreigner
she'd have good luck.
He's just a con man.
Why don't we get a mortgage
on the house?
Smart girl.
I did that ages ago.
That's where our money comes from.
Seven hundred rubles...
- Here.
- Thank you, Mister Vozhevatov.
Vassily Danilovich!
Moky Parmyonovich,
good morning, sir!
You're buying that barge
at a good price.
Yes, it's a good price.
Well, there's no use buying unless
you can buy it at a good price.
Will we see each other tonight
at the Ogoudalovs'?
Yes, Kharita Ignatievna did
invite me...
Let's go then, Moky Parmyonovich.
The girl is attractive.
She can sing and play instruments.
They make you feel free there.
All sort of people come to them.
Then when they meet you, they try
to engage you in conversation.
I bought a gift for Larissa.
- Was it expensive?
- Five hundred.
Well, you bought the barge cheap,
you can afford an expensive gift.
- Am I late?
- Yes, you're late.
Happy birthday, Larissa Dmitrievna.
Forgive me for being late.
My director delayed me.
- Welcome. Take your coat off.
- Thank you very much.
Kharita Ignatievna,
congratulations!
My director...
A toast to the health of the jewel
of our city, Larissa Dmitrievna!
To your health!
I've heard Larissa Dmitrievna has
a beautiful voice. Please sing for us.
With pleasure, gentlemen,
but not now, a bit later.
All right, we'll wait,
but we won't leave without a song.
Enjoy yourself, please,
ladies and gentlemen.
I was telling him...
Did you thank Vassya for the present?
- Thank you. It's very nice.
- It's nothing, really.
Nothing? Do you know what it cost,
a gift like that?
I'd like to propose a toast
in your honor...
Mister Karandyshev, it's not polite.
Larissa Dmitrievna's busy.
And then she opened her book to the Hussar!
After that, it's very funny.
I'll tell you later.
Take care of our guests.
More champagne!
Dear guests, please have some fruit.
Moky Parmyonovich...
I want to give my daughter
a very nice present.
But it costs a lot.
Too much for me.
What is it?
It's worth five hundred rubles.
I wish it was. Worth seven hundred.
And what do you think of your
daughter? What kind of girl is she?
I'm not quite sure about that.
It's better that you judge.
Larissa's not what you'd call
a practical, down-to-earth girl.
No.
- She's ethereal!
- I guess you're right.
- She was born to shine.
- Yes, to shine.
I'll never find the words
to thank you enough.
Don't mention it.
O Lord, forgive me,
I'm not doing it for myself.
I heard a funny couplet today
in court.
A court servant told it.
Grab whatever you can grab.
There's no sin in grabbing.
Only if you do get caught,
Then you'll be accused of sinning.
Yes, if you go to court dressed,
you come out naked.
And without shoes!
I never accept any bribes.
So you live on your wages only?
No one ever offered you any bribe.
Your job is not all that lucrative.
If you had been offered and
you didn't accept it, then...
Where are you going? You behave now.
Sergey Sergeyevich,
at last, my dear!
Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.
- Greetings to you.
- Hello.
Please, come in.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like
to propose a toast...
Wait!
Congratulations!
I wanted to present to you
this little token myself.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
That's our golden boy. Always
surprising us. Have a drink.
Show your gratitude.
Let's drink to Larissa,
ladies and gentlemen!
Oh, that was a real surprise!
You promised to sing for us.
I believe the time's right now.
If you say so.
Do us a favor.
Make yourselves comfortable,
ladies and gentlemen.
Caressed by a plaid of plushy yarn,
From yester dreams I extricate a ghost.
What was it? Who has ever won?
And who has lost? And who has lost?
And thinking over all again,
Reliving pain sent from above
In all that I cannot even name,
In all that I cannot even name,
Was there love?
Who was the hunter? Who the prey?
That was a devilish design.
And what the purring cat, all gray,
Could see in it? What sign?
In that uncompromising duel
Who finally had upper hand?
Whose heart-yours? mine?-was fuelled
Whose heart-yours? mine?-was fuelled
To gallop foolishly ahead?
And yet, what was it though?
What is this yearning, this regret?
Was I to win? I don't know.
Was I to win? I don't know.
Or maybe it was my defeat?
Or maybe it was my defeat?
Bravo!
This girl should have every luxury.
A precious stone should have
only the best setting.
And a good jeweler.
Gentlemen, let me introduce
Sergey Sergeyevich Paratov.
Larissa Dmitrievna, may I have
the honor of the first dance?
- Your name, please?
- Ivan Petrovich Semyonovsky.
So do I have a chance?
Everyone says that you're a good
shot.
Can you hit a glass
at a distance of twelve paces?
I'll hit it.
Maybe we could go outside?
- It's cold out there.
- You don't want to risk it?
Ivan Petrovich, this isn't right.
But you said...
Try this way, please.
Gentlemen, this is madness!
Do you have to carry it so far?
We'll buy you a new glass, auntie.
Paratov is always doing
something crazy.
- Are you scared?
- No. I'm not afraid of anything.
Go on, shoot!
Don't be shy.
Please come back inside now.
We're going to serve tea.
Bravo!
Great shot. My congratulations.
Now I'm going to demonstrate
how I do it.
Hold this watch in your hand.
At a distance of twelve paces,
I'll hit it with one bullet!
What's wrong?
I don't know
how well you shoot.
As you wish.
Who's going to take a chance?
I am!
- Larissa Dmitrievna!
- What is it, Sergey Sergeyevich?
- Aren't you afraid?
- I don't fear anything with you.
- I won't permit it!
- Leave me alone, Yuli Kapitonovich!
- Let's not carry this too far.
- Go away, Vassya.
Don't listen to what he says!
It's impossible not to listen
to what he says.
- Why do you trust him so much?
- I trust him in every way.
Please, don't shoot!
You've got no heart!
Don't shoot!
Don't interfere, or I may miss!
Sergey Sergeyevich, shoot!
It was a very good watch,
and very expensive.
You're a naughty boy!
I was so scared.
This is nothing. In the Caucasus
it happens all the time.
Yuli Kapitonovich, I think
we've been invited to tea with jam.
Weren't you afraid of the gun?
I'm not sure.
Sergey Sergeyevich!
Larissa Dmitrievna, I couldn't
find you.
Mother sent me for the jam.
- And what are you doing?
- I'm tasting it. Want to try?
I'd love to.
You've got jam all over.
Sergey Sergeyevich,
where are you?
And Larissa Dmitrievna
has disappeared.
It's delicious.
If you want to shoot,
you'd better load the gun first.
It looks like it's not loaded.
I hurt my hand!
Damn you all!
Where are you going?
Oh, mother, please don't stop me.
Who is out there?
It's Paratov, isn't it?
Yes.
Why are you looking at me like that?
You think I don't know what
it feels like? I'm a woman too.
Maybe Fate will have mercy on you.
You'd better go.
Make sure to be back not too late.
Drive on!
Would you like to have a look
at my "Swallow"?
It's your last chance
because she's going into dry dock.
I've been told your "Swallow"
is the fastest ship on the Volga.
The "Swallow" is ready to leave.
This is Larissa Dmitrievna.
Mr. Mikhin, the captain.
Would you like to take a trip
down the Volga?
This is the heart of the "Swallow".
Come on down.
The engines!
Kuzmich, start them up!
They do the work of 500 horses.
Put it on, Kuzmich!
That's what you call real power.
Why did they fire that gun?
They always fire a shot when
I'm leaving or coming in.
It's my way of flattering myself.
Let's go to the bridge.
Be careful now.
It's much warmer here.
Would you like to see what it feels
like to hold the wheel?
You must have guessed it.
Yegor, give the wheel
to Larissa Dmitrievna.
Aye, aye, sir!
What should I do?
One hand on this side,
and the other one like this.
Can you see the white buoy there?
It must be on the starboard side.
Who is that over there?
- Captain!
- Aye, aye, sir!
Off our bow. She's sending smoke.
It's the "Saint Olga".
Shall we catch up with the "Saint
Olga", Larissa Dmitrievna?
Oh yes!
Then you should warn her.
Two short ones...
and one long.
Yegor, come on, take the wheel!
That's enough, Larissa Dmitrievna,
it's a man's job.
- Full ahead!
- Aye, aye, sir!
Full speed ahead!
Sergey Sergeyevich, we'll have to
go much quicker to catch up.
Captain, Larissa Dmitrievna's
afraid we won't catch up to her.
Go on, Kuzmich, put on a little
speed.
Faster! I'll give each crew member
a gold coin if we catch up.
Thanks, sir.
It's time to take off now!
Two short ones and one long.
- May I, Captain?
- Please do.
Kuzmich, dear, we caught up!
Thank you.
It's just a piece of cake, Miss.
- Goodbye, Kuzmich!
- Goodbye, Miss.
Well, you must be hungry.
I'm starving.
- Will you have dinner with me?
- I'd love to.
Let's go to the dining room then.
As a matter of fact, I'm hungry too.
The white moth
To the closing bine,
The bee to the opened clover,
And the Gipsy blood
To the Gipsy blood
Ever the wide world over.
Follow the Romany patteran
West to the sinking sun,
Till the junk-sails lift through
the houseless drift,
And the East and the West are one.
The pied snake to the rifted rock,
The buck to the stony plain,
And the Romany lass to the Romany lad,
And both to the road again.
Both to the road again, again!
Out on a clean sea-track
Follow the cross of the Gipsy trail
Over the world and back!
- Hello, Larissa Dmitrievna.
- Good morning.
- Enjoying the sight of the Volga?
- No, of the ship.
- And what ship is it?
- The Swallow.
It's impossible.
I work for the post office.
I know everything.
Coachman!
To the station!
You can still sell the "Swallow".
Well, eventually I might have
to sell.
I'm not sure if I can save my estate.
The managers are all thieves!
We can't trust anyone nowadays.
That's my family estate.
I hate to lose it.
They're forcing me to put everything
up for auction, scoundrels!
Do you have a pen and paper?
No. We don't have any use
for them here.
You mean you sold them for drinks.
Do you have a second, Vassily?
I'm afraid I haven't behaved
nicely with Larissa.
I didn't have time to go see her.
As a friend of hers, I ask you
to explain to her
that I had to leave in a big hurry.
I'm going to write to her
as soon as I can.
She's a sensitive person,
she'll understand.
Still it wasn't nice.
I'm such a cad.
Ladies and gentlemen, all aboard,
please! The train is leaving!
See you soon!
Good luck!
I'm, like a moth drawn to the light,
So much attracted to that land,
The land of love where I might
Be called the most beloved friend,
Where any day is paradise,
And never rain goes in rapids
The land of love, it does entice,
It does entice,
The only place one can be happy.
But we're no more in grace,
You never come, you lie without
ending.
I realized that love's the place
Where everyone is just pretending.
It's not my fault, but my bad lot
That I'm a model of believing.
The land of love is just a fraud,
It's just a fraud,
With every citizen deceiving.
Why cry? Why feel unsafe?
Why smile at you with no reason?
The land of love means no faith,
Where every man commits a treason.
But grass will grow with new swing,
In spite of all that may mishappen.
The love land is the land of spring,
The land of spring,
The only place one can be happy,
One can be happy.
Charming!
- You sang beautifully.
- Thank you.
Champagne, ladies and gentlemen!
I think I'm going to cry.
He just proposed to me.
Who is that man, Gulyaev?
A bank director.
I think he's from Moscow.
Disgusting!
The man throws his money around.
Nowadays it's impossible
to live without a carriage.
- Absolutely.
- You must buy one.
Where will we get the money?
We mortgaged our house.
If you try to influence your
daughter, Larissa Dmitrievna...
Here, six hundred rubles.
You can buy a good carriage.
God forbid, I can't take it...
Take it, it's nothing.
If Larissa Dmitrievna
accepts my proposal...
I've got great plans.
- And here's an ace for you.
- You won, Father.
The hen pecks grain after grain.
Olga wrote us from Tiflis.
She's very unhappy there.
Very unhappy.
What am I living for?
I just don't know.
And here is my surprise.
Come in here. Let's have some music!
Larissa Dmitrievna!
Come on, music!
Gentlemen, let's ask Larissa
Dmitrievna to dance for us.
Yes, let her dance!
I'm sick of them all.
Larissa Dmitrievna, my goddess,
I'm waiting!
We beg you.
- No, I don't want to.
- You should.
- I don't feel like it...
- Show your talent!
Please, do it for me, dear.
You gorgeous woman!
I beg you, show your talent!
Stop it, ladies and gentlemen.
- Are you Mister Gulyaev?
- Yes...
- You're under arrest.
- Why?
I'm sure you know why.
Wait a minute.
Mr. Gulyaev is director of a bank.
A cashier. He went off with
everything in the safe.
Goodbye, everyone. That was my
swan song. Don't blame me.
And who will pay us for the music?
Next time.
My hands are not free now.
You may carry on, ladies and
gentlemen.
What a scandal!
Here, take this.
Kharita Ignatievna, may I be
of any help to you?
Thank you, Vassya.
But what can you do now?
First it was Paratov who drove all
the suitors away and disappeared.
And now it's this horrible cashier...
We can't go anywhere,
everyone points a finger at us.
I don't care anymore.
I don't feel anything.
Everything has been just like
a dream for a long time.
Don't worry, darling.
We'll make a new start.
It's no use.
I sacrifice everything I have.
I try as hard as I can.
And I'm not that old,
I still could find myself a good man.
Then find one, mother.
I've been humiliated enough.
It's better to be humiliated in youth
and be respected all your life.
But that's living a lie!
Yes. There's no point in playing
innocent in our situation.
All right. I'll marry the first man
who asks me.
I won't even bother to find out
if he's rich or poor.
Well, it's your choice...
Just one kopeck, please...
I wish somebody gave me a kopeck.
- Get in, mama.
- No, you go first.
Let me help you.
Give me your hand.
Thank you, mama.
Let's go, coachman!
I guess my fate is here.
What?
It's fantastic!
Do you like it?
It's wonderful!
Wrap it up, please,
in a nice box.
Very well, sir.
You're naughty. That's not allowed!
Madame, I'm going to deliver this.
- Larissa Dmitrievna...
- No!..
I'll do it.
I haven't yet got one tender
gesture from you.
Later, Yuli Kapitonovich.
That's 60 rubles, please.
Sweetheart, why don't you go
for a walk while I pay this.
You said it was 50 before.
We used Brussels lace,
applied some fantasy,
that's why it's more expensive.
How can you bargain when
you're marrying such a beauty?
All right. All right.
Just make sure you wrap it
with silk ribbons.
I'll wait outside.
May I introduce to you
my bride?
My congratulations,
Yuli Kapitonovich.
And my congratulations to you
as well for a wise choice.
- Will I be invited to the wedding?
- Of course, you will.
You there, have my carriage sent
here.
I'm happy for you, Yuli Kapitonovich.
Good luck to you, Vassya!
- Is that your carriage?
- Yes, from my estate.
- Back up!
- Come forward!
No! Hold this.
What are you doing? Stop it!
You're going to get hurt.
- I forbid you to.
- Why were you in such a hurry?
Yuli Kap...
Good luck!
I find it rather strange
that you call him Vassya.
It's too familiar.
We've known each other since we
were children. I'm used to it.
It's time you gave up your old
habits.
What you had in your house
must not go on.
We didn't do anything wrong.
You had a Gypsy camp,
that's what you had in your house.
Do you think I liked that kind
of life?
I wouldn't be running away from it
by marrying you
if it weren't so.
It's not because of any of your
qualities that I chose you.
You haven't shown me
any qualities yet.
I'm only trying to fall in love
with you.
I'm at a crossroad,
please help me.
I didn't mean to offend you.
As for the Gypsy camp,
you may be right.
But some of those people
were very nice.
Who, for instance? I hope
it's not Sergey Sergeyevich Paratov?
That's not for you to judge.
Do you think he behaved nicely
with you?
If even I don't condemn him,
then I won't let you do it either.
Have you heard the news? Larissa
Dmitrievna is going to get married.
- To whom?
- Karandyshev.
- That's ridiculous!
- I know.
He's not the man for her.
D'you think Kharita'd have given her
to him if she found anyone better?
How could she?
The Ogoudalovs are a good family.
And all of a sudden,
some Karandyshev!
Their house is always full of
bachelors...
They love to visit,
but as for marrying...
She did marry off two of her girls.
That's true,
but Olga Dmitrievna's luck is bad.
They say her little Caucasian
killed a man out of jealousy.
I heard that... Too many scoundrels
have been admitted to their house.
Some bore Larissa Dmitrievna
with compliments,
others with endearments.
They buzz like a nest of hornets,
preventing one from having
a word with her.
I'd like to be alone with her,
without any interference.
In that case, you have to marry.
Not everyone can.
Me for example, I'm married.
Then there's no solution.
- The girl is too young.
- You think so?
There were many suitors,
and not one chose her...
To get married at all costs,
even to Karandyshev!
It would be great to make a trip to
Paris with her, to the world fair.
Yes, it would be a pleasant trip.
So that's what you had in mind.
- Didn't you have similar plans?
- That's beyond my reach.
Well, you have a better chance
than I. Youth's a great thing!
You got the "Swallow" at a good
price. You could use the profit...
Every goods has its own price.
Yes, I'm young, but I can't
use my profits that way.
Congratulations.
You've become a good businessman.
Speaking of the devil, here they are.
That poor girl.
She'll be living in poverty,
and with an idiot husband.
She will either become vulgar
or perish.
And I think she's going to dump him
very soon.
I guess you're right.
I want you to serve dinner
for me this evening.
At your service, sir.
- You'd better dress properly.
- Sure, a tailcoat.
Moky Parmyonovich, I'd like to invite
you for dinner at my house tonight.
At your house?
It's the same as our house.
A dinner in honor of Larissa.
So you're the one who's inviting?
Well, I shall come then.
I want Larissa Dmitrievna surrounded
with only the elite.
- May I count on you?
- I said I will.
It's time to go to the wharf.
Moky Parmyonovich,
we plan a wedding party.
However, everything costs
so much, especially...
All right, I'll drop by your place.
You didn't put yourself out for
Vozhevatov, did you?
Are you going to be jealous?
Will you stop this nonsense?
It's so vulgar, I won't put up
with it.
Look, a ship is coming alongside.
Can you see which one?
SWALLOW
I can't tell, it's too far.
What's that? A gun shot?
They must be firing in honor of
some power-hungry trader.
- It scared me.
- Why?
I just felt dizzy looking down.
Come now, don't be childish.
- What's going on out there?
- The master has come back
We've waited for him almost a year!
- Good morning, sir!
- Good morning, everyone!
Doesn't it hurt you
to sell the "Swallow"?
Nothing can hurt me.
For me, there's nothing
that is sacred.
If I see it's to my advantage,
then I'll sell anything.
The master has arrived!
- Greetings to you, men!
- Greetings, sir!
- Did you catch a bear?
- I'm waiting for you.
- Do we go together?
- Whenever you like.
It's the big bear we're after.
Well, how are you?
Is that really you,
Sergey Sergeyevich?
Yes, I changed everything -
another business, other projects.
I'm starting a new life.
Sergey Sergeyevich,
shall we go and sign the deed?
Let's go!
Gentlemen, I forgot
to introduce you.
This is my friend...
Robinson.
Are you English?
He's a provincial actor,
Arkady Shchastlivtsev.
Why do you call him Robinson?
He was on board a ship,
with his friend, a trader.
Naturally, the two of them
were as drunk as lords.
So these two really had
a time of it.
And as if it wasn't enough,
they played a dramatic scene.
They took off all of their clothes...
they tore a pillow apart...
and rolled in the feathers...
Then they imitated the natives
dancing.
At the request of the passengers,
they were left on a deserted island.
We happened to go by this island.
I saw them calling for help,
waving their arms.
So I took him on board and
gave him some of my clothes.
I always have extra clothing.
That's why he's called Robinson.
Oh, my friends!
Hello, Ilya!
It's always so wonderful
When the Gypsies have a chance,
With love flowing bountiful,
Meet friends with song and dance.
Our heart makes no difference,
Our custom always stands:
We treat our friends with deference,
We love all our friends!
That's our song for all to hear,
To our drinking there's no end,
We're greeting our dear
Sergey Sergeyevich, our friend!
A toast to Seryozha,
To Seryozha dear!
Such a handsome person
Has never yet appeared!
Welcome back!
We're at your service.
- Hello, Gavrilo!
- So good to see you!
Gentlemen, tonight we'll all go
on board the "Swallow" and drink.
Ilya, take your family along too.
And we'll get a military orchestra.
I'll get all the food ready.
Do it! And make everything ready
by six o'clock.
If there's too much food, it's OK,
if there's not enough, you'll pay.
Got it.
I haven't known him that long,
but I love him already.
And I invite you for dinner
in my home.
My bachelor life is coming to an end,
that's the occasion.
Yes, gentlemen, I'm getting married!
She's rich though.
I'll be getting a gold mine
as a dowry.
That's a wonderful dowry.
It certainly is.
A good dowry,
but it costs me a lot.
It means saying goodbye
to my free, merry life.
I'm sorry, we're not able
to accept your invitation.
We've been invited elsewhere.
- Get yourselves excused.
- We cannot do that either.
Why?
We're having dinner at Larissa
Dmitrievna's fiance's
Larissa is going to get married?
Well, it's to the better.
I felt a bit guilty towards her,
and this way everything's alright.
To think that I almost married
Larissa.
That would have been a riot!
I just hope that God will give her
happiness and health.
End of Part One
A CRUEL ROMANCE
Part Two
So you think
you're doing a good thing
by marrying Larissa Dmitrievna to
a man who has no wealth whatsoever.
It's what she wanted.
From his point of view,
the bridegroom is no fool.
Who knows him?
Whoever noticed him?
And now he's mingling in
with the best society.
Why, he went so far as to invite me
for dinner, for example.
But what's so stupid is...
that it never entered his mind how
he's going to live with such a wife.
Well, I hope she'll leave him soon
and come back to live here.
That's no good. With what means
will my daughter and I live?
This can be helped. A sympathetic
assistance from a strong, rich man...
If we could find such a man.
You must do your best to find him.
Yes, we must.
Miss, your fiance has arrived!
Ah, I got carried away, but that
isn't the reason I came here.
You should have a nice trousseau
for Larissa Dmitrievna to wear.
I mean a wedding dress
and all that goes with it.
You mustn't let her look
like an ordinary girl.
I want you to order everything from
the best shop, whatever the cost.
You can send me the bill.
That's why I came here today.
I just can't find words to thank you.
No need to thank me.
Please, I want to go to your
country house right away.
Why such a hurry?
I want to get away from here.
What makes you want it?
Are you ashamed of me?
So far you gave me no reason
to be ashamed.
Why hide from everyone then?
I feel so happy!
Give me a chance to enjoy
the present situation.
When will we go then?
After the wedding.
But the wedding is going to be here!
I don't want people to say
that I'm no match for you,
but just a straw
that a drowning persons catches at.
Even if it's true?
You can keep this truth
to yourself.
You might try working a little,
you cow!
Please, have pity on me.
At least try to pretend in front of
others that you love me.
What for?
I have some pride, you know.
You care about yourself only.
When will someone really love me?
You are all going to destroy me.
Come now, Larissa. What's wrong?
I'm afraid of something.
As long as we're having the wedding
here, let it be as quiet as possible.
No, you're going to shine as never
before and everyone will see it.
Yes. And I won't skimp on expenses.
I'm a toy doll for you. You'll play
with me and then throw me away.
If you only knew how much
this dinner's costing me.
No one really cares about
your dinner.
- I do.
- Why?
Because I had to bear mockery
from your friends for three years.
It's my turn now
to laugh at them.
If you plan to start an argument,
Larissa and I won't come.
Please, don't offend anyone.
There'll be no arguments.
I will just propose a toast
in your honor
and thank you publicly
for the happiness you're giving me
by choosing me as your husband,
for your appreciation of me and
for believing in my sincerity.
That will be my revenge.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Those fops and braggarts disgust me!
You should have seen everyone
in the city today!
All the joy in their faces.
All the coachmen have gone mad!
Everyone is so happy!
The Master has come!
Waiters in the inns are beaming:
The Master is here!
The Gypsies are shouting:
The Master is here!
However, the "Master" is totally
ruined, he sold his last ship.
A squandering idler,
a corrupt man!
And the whole city rejoices!
What insanity!
Who are you talking about?
Your Sergey Sergeyevich Paratov.
I want to go to the country,
right this minute.
- Why are you afraid?
- It's not for me I'm afraid.
- Who then?
- It's for you.
Don't be afraid for me.
I won't let myself be offended.
I must go now,
we have guests coming.
I'll send the carriage to fetch you.
Thank you for your purchase.
The dealer said we could have
the wine at ten kopecks a bottle
and he'd stick any label we want.
He gave us good wine too. It smells
of cloves and something else...
Get into the carriage.
Oh, my dear friends!
To the Ogoudalovs'!
Ma'am, Sergey Sergeyevich Paratov!
Mama, receive him here!
Why are you so nervous?
Please, get rid of him quickly.
What a wonderful surprise!
Why are you here? Just passing?
No, I returned here on purpose.
And my first visit is to you.
Welcome, welcome. You've changed.
Your beard is gone.
It makes you look younger,
although you're older, too.
And you look the same as ever,
auntie. Even better.
- I swear it!
- You're so cunning!
Sergey Sergeyevich, my dear!
Why did you go away so suddenly?
I received an unpleasant telegram.
I was forced to rush and try
to save my property.
I had big losses.
However, I keep up a good moral
and haven't lost my sense of humor.
I can see that.
Well, one can lose and win
at the same time.
What are you planning to win?
I would like to pay my respects
to Larissa Dmitrievna.
I'm not sure if Larissa Dmitrievna
would like to see you...
Is she in?
In the garden.
Thank you, auntie.
What a devil!
Don't you recognize me?
You didn't expect me.
I stopped expecting you long ago.
Why did you stop?
You disappeared so suddenly...
You didn't even write to me.
I couldn't find anything nice
to write about.
That's what I thought.
You're getting married, aren't you?
Let me ask you something.
Did you wait a long time?
Do you really care?
What interests me is
a theoretical question,
which is how long
can a woman love anyone
before she forgets him?
One day after they're separated?
A week? Or maybe a month?
I'm not going to tell you.
You may think whatever you like.
I will always think of you
with the deepest respect.
However, I'm not going to respect
women in general
after what you've done.
What have I done?
You don't understand anything.
I understand you're getting
married...
I am forced to do it.
Larissa, I feel guilty. I was...
What? You were what?
What did you want to say?
I wanted to ask you...
Larissa, did you forget me?
Say it to me now!
Please, tell me. I beg you.
Do you love me?
Tell me...
Of course, I do.
There's no point in asking.
Thank you.
If you preferred another to me...
You would have offended me
very much.
I trust you will not abuse
my sincerity.
I wouldn't do that, Larissa.
I have certain principles.
Marriage for me is a sacred thing.
Anyway...
I've known you so long, and I think
that your future husband
has many good points.
He only has one good point.
Not much, is it?
But it's a precious one.
What is that point?
He's in love with me.
- Why are you running?
- Let me pass...
Let me introduce you.
Yuli Kapitonovich, the fiance...
But we know each other.
I'm an old friend of the Ogoudalovs.
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
You're not jealous?
I trust that Larissa Dmitrievna
won't give any cause for it.
Those who are jealous often don't
have any reason to be jealous.
I can guarantee Yuli Kapitonovich
will never feel jealous.
Yes, I think so.
Though if you...
Yes, it would be a horrible thing
to live with.
Gentlemen, what are you talking
about? Let's change the subject.
Yuli Kapitonovich and I are
leaving soon for the country.
Leaving this wonderful place?
I don't see what you find
so wonderful here.
Well, different strokes for
different folks.
Some like the city, while others
prefer the country.
You know the saying.
One loves watermelons and
the other loves pig's knuckles.
How do you know so many sayings?
I used to mix with barge haulers
who taught me the Russian language.
Imagine, learning the Russian
language from barge haulers!
And why not?
- Because we consider them...
- Who is "we"?
We, the educated people,
and not some barge haulers.
And what do you think the barge
haulers are?
I must stand up for them.
When you come to think of it,
I'm a barge hauler myself.
We consider them an example
of ignorance.
What else, Mister Karandyshev?
Nothing. I've nothing to add.
I do, however.
We're not finished yet.
You owe me an apology.
Me? Apologize to you?
Gentlemen, enough now...
Don't worry. I won't challenge him
to a duel. Not for that.
Your fiance will live this time.
I'm just going to teach him
a lesson.
As a rule I never forgive anyone.
Yuli Kapitonovich!
Apologize this instant!
I'm ordering you!
Why should I?
I don't understand...
I suggest you learn to understand
first,
after that you might argue.
Sergey Sergeyevich, for God's sake,
I beg you...
Please! Do it for me! Forgive him!
You should thank Kharita Ignatievna.
I forgive you.
Next time, my dear, think first
to whom you're talking.
I'll let you go now.
Another time, I won't let you go!
Don't say a word.
Larissa, order some champagne served
so we can have some peace here.
Yuli Kapitonovich,
please try to control yourself.
Now you'd better invite
Sergey Sergeyevich to dinner.
I just wanted to do it.
Sergey Sergeyevich...
Would you like to have dinner
at my place today?
With pleasure.
I'm not through with that imbecile
anyway.
Well, Robinson,
you'll have to pay me a favor.
I want you to come to a dinner
with me today.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm a very
happy man today!
I would like to propose a toast.
Kharita Ignatievna...
Ivan! Some Burgundy wine!
I have a wonderful news!
I've applied for magistrate.
- Here?
- No, in Zabolotye.
There're very few candidates there,
so he may win.
Yes, there aren't that many there,
I've got a very good chance.
Sir, some Burgundy?
The label says Burgundy,
but there's cheap wine inside.
- Mama, stop him!
- How? He's not a child.
I was so ashamed.
He's never seen a dinner
given by cultured people.
I did nothing wrong, but I feel
so sorry. I want to run away.
And he looks as if nothing happened
at all. He's even happy.
Please, gentlemen.
Cigars, take one.
They must be expensive.
Around seven rubles a hundred.
High quality, only the best.
No. I'll smoke my own.
- These are good cigars.
- Then smoke them yourself.
As you wish. Please.
No, they're too expensive for me.
Sir Robinson, do you smoke?
Now that's a funny question.
Why don't you light one then?
If I smoked one of these in a proper
house, I'd be spanked for it.
And I've hated spanking
since I was a little boy.
How original! You can tell
right away he's English.
- Let's have a drink.
- That's a good idea.
To the ladies!
To the ladies!
Ivan, more Burgundy!
He's not that stupid.
Doesn't he see what's going on?
Not stupid, but certainly conceited.
Why do they make him drink?
They're having a bit of fun I guess.
- But they make me suffer.
- No one wants you to suffer.
You see, you're not married yet,
but you're suffering already.
Gentlemen, I haven't eaten a thing.
It's never happened to me
at a dinner.
Why invite respected people
if you don't serve anything to eat?
He's a stupid man, gentlemen.
We really should be fair with him.
He is stupid.
And he was the first to get drunk.
Yes, we helped him a bit though.
In a situation like this,
we need people like Robinson.
So you're the one who arranged
this farce.
Well, this mixture that he calls
wine is undrinkable.
And Robinson is used to foreign
wines made in Yaroslavl.
He drinks it, but only with his
host, who swallowed the bait.
It doesn't take much to make him
drunk. Two drinks and he's in heaven.
Serve the tea...
What's all this hanging here?
Looks like props from the theatre.
Sir, be careful!
It's loaded.
They're real.
Sergey Sergeyevich!
Yes?
Stop mocking at
Yuli Kapitonovich.
I could never do that.
So you didn't forget the argument
you had a while ago?
All right. If you want,
I'll put an end to all this.
I do.
- Yuli Kapitonovich!
- What do you want?
Do you want to drink to friendship
with me?
Mister Vozhevatov,
we're waiting for you outside.
Just one minute, we're coming.
Ivan, cognac!
Oh, no! I hate small glasses.
Get some big ones!
Ivan! Big glasses!
Why didn't you tell us
you had cognac?
We lost a lot of precious...
time.
Now Paratov will give him
the death blow.
- Ilya!
- Yes, Sergey Sergeyevich?
- Where is the guitar?
- I forgot to take it.
- I must have a guitar.
- I'll bring it right away.
I'll ask Larissa Dmitrievna to sing
for us, and we'll leave right after.
It won't be much fun to leave
without Larissa Dmitrievna.
If she could go with us...
I'd be willing to pay dearly
to have her company.
I'd be willing to pay one ruble
to every crew member
if she were to come
on board my "Swallow".
I admit that I thought of it too.
Is it possible at all?
Everything on earth is possible.
We don't need Robinson though.
He'll get as drunk as a beast.
So we won't take him.
Larissa Dmitrievna,
make us happy.
Would you please sing a love song
for us?
I haven't heard you sing for a year.
It may be the last chance I've got.
May I also ask you
to sing for us?
No, no, gentlemen!
Out of the question!
Larissa Dmitrievna is not going
to sing.
How do you know she won't sing?
Will you excuse me, gentlemen,
I have no voice today.
Please, any song you want.
Look, I tell you she is not
going to sing.
Do you want us to beg?
We'll go on our knees if we have to.
Yes, I will. I'm very agile.
No, gentlemen, there's no use
asking. I forbid it!
You'll forbid it when you have the
right to. You'll have to wait for it.
I positively forbid her to sing...
- You forbid it?
- Yes.
I'm going to sing, gentlemen!
- What do you want to sing?
- The farewell song.
And as I go I will say...
And as I go I will say:
Goodbye, of love make no promise.
I go insane, or I attain
The highest point of pure madness.
How did you love? You partook of
My ruin! But it doesn't matter.
How did you love? You ruined love,
You didn't know any better.
So as I go I will say...
The temple still does its skimpy work,
But hands went limp, no life
imparting,
And slantwise, in a frightened flock,
The scents and sounds are departing.
And as I go I will say:
Goodbye, of love make no promise.
I go insane, or I attain
The highest point of pure madness.
And as I go I will say...
I was cursing myself
while you sang.
But why?
Because I lost a treasure like you.
Whose fault was that?
Mine! Only mine! You don't even
know how much at fault I was.
Why did I leave you?
And what did I gain?
Then why did you do it?
I lost a lot more than my fortune.
But I swear,
a few more minutes like these...
being with you like this,
and I would give up everything,
and nothing could separate us.
- What is it you want then?
- To look at you.
To listen to you sing, Larissa.
Larissa, I'm leaving tomorrow...
Don't say anything now.
All our party will be going
on the "Swallow" now.
Please come with us.
On the "Swallow"?
I should stay here.
What is there to do here?
Just talking to Karandyshev's
aunt about the mushroom picking?
- When do we go?
- Now or never!
Let's go then.
Yes, I'm ready...
You've decided?
Yes. Wherever you want me to go.
Gentlemen! I propose a toast...
to Larissa Dmitrievna!
Gentlemen, you all just admired
the talent of
Larissa Dmitrievna.
Thank you.
However, the main talent of
my fiancee...
the main one is her...
Gentlemen, I know...
He can't talk.
Yes, gentlemen, she knows
how to appreciate
and choose people of quality.
He'll get through it.
He learned it by heart.
She can separate the wheat
from the chaff.
She was looking for a man
not brilliant but dignified.
And she chose...
- You?
- Yes.
Bravo!
I have every reason to be
a proud man...
Gentlemen, she'll go.
I'm proud, gentlemen...
She preferred me to anyone.
Bravo!
I want to publicly thank
Larissa Dmitrievna...
for making my life worthwhile
by choosing me.
Bravo!
Larissa Dmitrievna!
Steady, steady... Yuli Kapitonovich...
I'm drinking...
and I'm asking all of you
to drink to my fiancee.
Gentlemen, I propose another toast.
I suggest that we drink our toast
to one of the happiest men
in the whole world, to you, Yuli.
- Do you have any wine left?
- Yes.
- Please have it served.
- It will be served immediately.
Robinson, why are you crying?
She sang so beautifully...
You must have drunk too much.
Go help him with the wine.
And don't come back too soon.
Oh no, you've had enough
of that poison.
Gentlemen, we will leave promptly
by that gate.
Without waiting for the toast?
Good things are tastier
in little doses.
Larissa Dmitrievna,
we're waiting for you.
- Goodbye, mama.
- Where are you going?
Either you'll be happy for me,
or look for me in the Volga.
- Don't be a fool...
- One can't escape one's own fate.
Larissa... You're insane...
Don't do it!
You've gone too far.
Larissa, do you hear me?
Stay here!
Do I have to stop you by force?
Please, wait!
Where are you all going?
Gentlemen, here I am...
Where are you?
Auntie, have you seen
my fiancee?
Ivan! Where did
all the gentlemen go?
And Larissa Dmitrievna?
I believe everyone went
on board the "Swallow".
What do you mean, the "Swallow"?
Vozhevatov is giving a party to
celebrate the purchase of the ship.
The purchase?
They brought along Gypsies
to have some music...
What Gypsies?
And Larissa Dmitrievna too?
How is this possible?
Kharita Ignatievna...
Where's your daughter? Answer me.
I brought my daughter to your
house, Yuli Kapitonovich.
It's up to you to tell me
where my daughter is.
Why... they planned it...
They're all immoral, they're cruel.
You celebrated too early.
Yes, stupid, isn't it?
I'm ridiculous.
But can you condemn anyone
for being ridiculous?
All right, so I'm that way!
Laugh in my face!
Go on, eat, drink my wine...
But to pierce a man's heart
because he's ridiculous...
Get a hold of yourself,
she isn't worth the trouble!
And they're not all bandits.
They are honorable people,
they're all your friends.
I wasn't aware of anything.
You're all from the same band.
Don't forget though...
Even the meekest man
can get furious.
- What did he take?
- A pistol.
No fear anymore,
no law, no mercy!
Run! Catch him!
Stop him!
Yuli Kapitonovich! Stop!
The "Swallow" will leave
with her first passengers,
and I'll go to Paris, to the World
Fair. How I love foreign countries!
Today, gentlemen...
Today I have a very strange
feeling.
I'm on the "Swallow"
for the first time as a guest.
Let's have a drink, Captain.
We've been everywhere
on the Volga with you.
Thank you, Captain.
Shall we play our song, Ilya?
A cask of wine for the crew.
Seryozha, give me the guitar.
Life is too short,
as the philosophers say.
Let's take advantage of it!
I've never been so hungry as now,
after that dinner party.
It's better to forget it.
It's all in the past.
The white moth to the closing bine,
The red crane to her reed,
And the Romany lass to the Romany lad
By the tie of a roving breed.
Follow the Romany patteran
North where the blue bergs sail,
And the bows are gray with the frozen
spray,
And the masts are shod with mail.
Both to the road again, again!
Out on a clean sea-track -
Follow the cross of the gipsy trail
Over the world and back!
Follow the Romany patteran
East where the silence broods
By a purple wave on an opal beach
In the hush of the Mahim woods.
Follow the Romany patteran
Sheer to the Austral Light,
Where the besom of God is the wild
South wind,
Sweeping the sea-floors white.
Follow the Romany patteran
West to the sinking sun,
Till the junk-sails lift through
the houseless drift,
And the east and the west are one.
Larissa Dmitrievna!
Do us all a favour. Dance for us.
Yes, please, we beg you.
- I'm embarrassed.
- Please, don't refuse us.
Everyone is asking you.
Larissa Dmitrievna,
you must go home now.
I'm not going back home.
But it is impossible for you
to stay here.
No, Sergey Sergeyevich,
stop your fancy talk.
Give me a straight answer,
am I your wife now or not?
Think about the rumors you'll be
the source of if you don't go.
You brought me here,
so you'll bring me home.
My mother is waiting
to give us her blessing.
I don't think you have the right
to ask that.
You were the one who said...
Give up everything and I'm yours.
We might talk about it some time,
not now...
We'll talk now.
- Do you insist?
- Yes, I do.
Very well.
You see...
When a man has been bound
hand and foot,
he might give in to his feelings
to the point where he forgets
about his obligations
and the chains binding him.
But then...
he opens his eyes
and sees the horrible truth,
realizing he can't break the chains.
Are you married?
No.
Other chains won't be an obstacle.
I'll share any burden with you.
I'm engaged.
No!
I'm bound with these chains.
Why didn't you tell me?
It's godless...
The only thing I saw was you.
I couldn't think of nothing else.
Believe me, I'm telling the truth.
That's enough.
- Please, listen...
- No! Go away!
I can take care of myself.
Go away...
I can't help thinking about
Larissa Dmitrievna.
We had nothing to do with it.
We're not to blame.
The girl has found herself
in a very difficult situation.
So we, her friends,
are not only allowed,
we feel forced
to take part in her destiny.
D'you mean that's the right occasion
to take her to Paris, for example?
Yes, why not?
Well, what's stopping you?
You're stopping me,
and I'm stopping you.
You might not fear rivalry.
Not that it bothers me either,
however, it is annoying.
Things usually go a lot smoother
when the way is clear.
Well, you can't bribe me.
A bribe isn't necessary.
There're other ways to settle this.
What do you take, heads or tails?
If I say "heads", I'll lose for sure.
You're going to take heads.
Tails!
You win!
You will go to Paris with Larissa.
However, I still win.
It won't cost me anything.
But remember, you've given your
word, you should stand by it.
You're a merchant. You should
know what giving one's word means.
You're offending me,
Moky Parmyonovich.
I know what a merchant's word is!
Vassya, I'm lost!
Larissa, my dear,
I don't see what can be done.
We're like brother and sister,
you know. Help me!
Larissa, I'd like to help,
but it's impossible.
Just pity me,
that's all I ask.
I'm sorry, Larissa. I can't.
Are you chained down as well?
Worse. I'm in shackles.
What kind?
I gave my word. A merchant's word.
Larissa Dmitrievna...
Please, listen to me,
and don't take offense.
It is not my intention
to offend you in any way.
The only thing I want
is your happiness.
If anyone deserves that,
it's surely you.
Would you like to go
to Paris with me?
To the World Fair.
I'm also offering you security
for the rest of your life.
There'll be nothing to be ashamed of.
No one will blame you for anything.
I can assure you there're boundaries
that reprobation does not cross.
I would see to it that your income
would be so
that the most spiteful gossips and
moralizers would be forced to shut up.
I would never hesitate
to offer you my hand,
but I'm already married.
Think it over.
If you decide
to accept my proposal,
then let me know.
There are very few things
that are beyond my reach.
What you did
calls for punishment.
But I'm the only one who has
the right to judge you.
I will decide whether or not
to forgive you.
Why are you here?
I will have my revenge
on every one of them
until they kill me.
What is it you want?
They insulted you and they are
going to pay the price!
The biggest insult for me is your
playing the role of my protector.
You think so?
Knurov and Vozhevatov are flipping
coins which one will get you.
Heads or tails will decide.
That's not an insult?
They consider you as an object...
I am an object! At long last
we know what I am!
I'm an object, not a human being...
Go away!
Every object should have an owner.
I'm going with Knurov.
- I'm your owner!
- I'm too expensive for you.
As long as I'm an object,
I'd better be expensive.
- I love you!
- No!
I own you!
I'm taking you!
Let me go!
Leave me alone...
You disgust me!
Don't touch me!
You're mine... Mine...
What are you doing?
Come to your senses...
Come back! I forgive you everything!
But I don't forgive myself!
I beg you! Don't leave me!
You can make me happy!
I'm willing to sacrifice anything!
I'll take any humiliation.
You're too worthless for me!
How can I win your love?
I love you!
You're lying! I looked for love
and it wasn't there!
You men consider me
just as a plaything.
I never found love,
so I'm looking for gold now!
Go away!
I can't belong to you.
I love you!
Stop!
You'll regret it!
- You should belong to me!
- Never!
Then you'll belong to no one!
Thank you...
The End
