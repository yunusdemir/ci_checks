Hey, fella!
Come on. Hey. Come here.
Hey, fella.
Come here.
<i>I found my thrill</i>
<i>On Blueberry Hill</i>
<i>On Blueberry Hill</i>
Can I help?
Yes. I hope so.
I want to sell this.
Uh, where'd you get this ring?
<i>It's mine.
My wife gave it to me.</i>
Look. The initials are on the inside.
Yes?
- "T.J.N."
- Yeah.
Do you have your I. D?
I'm British.
I have a passport.
<i>- "Thomas Jerome Newton."
- The wind in the willows played</i>
<i>- Love's sweet melody
- This is not a pawnshop.</i>
I beg your pardon?
If I buy this ring now,
you can't redeem it later.
- Understand?
- I understand.
<i>Were never to be</i>
<i>Though we're apart</i>
<i>You're part of me still</i>
Twenty dollars.
<i>- Twenty dollars?
- Take it or leave it.</i>
<i>On Blueberry Hill</i>
<i>Oliver.</i>
Oliver.
Oliver, Mr. Newton is here.
I'm Oliver Farnsworth.
Would you like a scotch and water
or something, Mr. Newton?
Oh, a glass of water.
<i>Fine.</i>
- Would you like a scotch?
- Yes, please.
Are you all right?
Just tired.
<i>I'm sorry I didn't have time to see you
at my office today, Mr. Newton.</i>
I had hardly even 10 minutes.
<i>Excuse me.</i>
What's this?
Some kind of bribe?
I'm paying you for your time.
As from now, I want at least 10 hours
at $1,000 an hour.
Mr. Newton, this kind of money buys
more than 10 hours even of my time.
What exactly do you want?
I want a lawyer
who's well versed in paten - patents.
That's me.
Here.
Electronics.
<i>Read the file.</i>
May I keep it overnight?
I'm sorry.
I can't leave it with you.
It's not that
I don't trust you.
All right. I'll read it.
If you want to put
a record on, Mr. Newton...
music doesn't disturb me.
Oh, no, thank you.
Well, if there's anything
you want, just ask.
<i>I don't believe it.</i>
<i>I can't believe it.
You have nine basic patents here.</i>
<i>Nine.</i>
<i>That's basic patents.
Do you know what that means?</i>
<i>- Yes, I think so.
- Do you really?</i>
<i>I wonder.</i>
<i>It- It means, Mr. Newton,
that you can take RCA...</i>
<i>Eastman Kodak and DuPont,
for starters.</i>
In, say, three years,
what would this be worth to me?
I'm a lawyer, not an accountant,
Mr. Newton.
But I'd say it must be
something in the area of...
$300 million.
- Not more?
- More?
- I need more.
- What the hell for?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
It's just I'm trying
to adjust my mind to all this.
I'll offer you 10% of my net profits...
plus five percent
of all corporate holdings.
I must think about it all.
I'll ask Trevor
to take you home.
I don't drive.
Thank you. I have
my own driver waiting.
<i>- All night?
- If you take this assignment...</i>
you'll have complete authority,
below me.
I don't want to have contact
with anyone except you.
When you take this position,
Mr. Farnsworth...
you'll be able to replace your antiquated
sound equipment and buy some of mine.
- Buy it?
- At cost, naturally.
<i>Perhaps you're not
so different after all, Mr. Newton.</i>
Arthur, would you
please slow down?
We're only doin' 45,
Mr. Newton.
It's making me feel dizzy.
<i>Keep to 30, please.</i>
<i>My father used to say, "Oliver...</i>
"when you get a gift horse,
walk up to it...
"pat it,
quiet the animal down...
"and then, using both hands,
force open its jaws...
and have a damned good look
in its mouth."
I'd say that was
good advice.
Yes. But my father
was always wrong.
Hello.
I just marked your paper.
How'd I do?
- Don't worry about it.
- I won't.
Oh, you! Ah!
Oh, shit!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Do you want to see
what they look like?
I don't believe this. No.
<i>No, it's impossible.</i>
<i>That one. Clever, isn't it?</i>
<i>It happened literally overnight.</i>
<i>When Mr. Newton
came into my apartment...</i>
<i>my old life went
straight out the window.</i>
<i>In no time at all,
I got a brand-new life, and I like it.</i>
<i>Maybe I'm not my own boss
the way I used to be...</i>
<i>but... so what?</i>
<i>Oliver, you're the president of
one of the largest corporations in America.</i>
<i>I'll tell you one thing. It's never too late.</i>
<i>I didn't think a man
could change at my age.</i>
<i>I still can't believe it.</i>
<i>Yes, that's possible.
We can do that.</i>
Are you sure this is
the right moment, Mr. Newton?
You know, don't you,
that this one has virtually no bottom?
No. No.
I want you to begin negotiations
with Eastman Kodak immediately.
<i>We've been together a long time now...</i>
<i>and I don't see why you'd
even consider selling off this division.</i>
Well, I mean, if I owned
a copyright on the Bible...
I wouldn't sell it
to Random House.
It's what I want.
I'm on my way to New Mexico now.
I shall be staying at
an hotel near the border.
<i>I can't tell you yet.
I'll be in touch.</i>
Results are results, Nate,
and your class is way below par.
I have the computer statement right here.
And, uh -
It's kind of sad.
The campus computer, I gather?
- That damn thing doesn't have a mind.
- It's not meant to have a mind.
That's what makes it perfect for this place, right?
Oh, the company that made that self-developing
film that I showed you a while ago?
They've, uh -They've made
this announcement.
They're -They're dumping computers.
They're installing human beings.
<i>- Oh, really.
- Want to know why?</i>
They want to bring back
human error...
because that's the way you get new ideas -
by making mistakes.
Back to man and his imagination.
If you can't spot a piece of bullshit
commercial publicity when you hear it...
you're even more naive
than I thought.
Keep your mind on your job.
- That's my advice.
- That's your advice to me?
<i>- Yeah.
- You're so fucking smug and ignorant,
you don't know what's going on.</i>
- Oh, really?
- These kids are bored.
They're bored with you
and these fucking textbooks.
They're five years out of date.
I mean -
What they need is some real stimulus.
- Ideas to pursue.
- Yes, well...
we've had enough
of your pursuits.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about
the things you pursue, Nate.
Young things.
I don't know. Maybe it's your age.
You've become a novelty freak,
and you're not that young anymore.
You don't even get it, do you?
I'm younger than most of those kids.
- Oh, come on!
- They're already middle-aged
because that's what they're taught.
Well, I want out.
<i>- That's the fact.
- Face the facts.</i>
What the hell else
can you do now except teach?
Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.
Tell you what. Why don't you go get a job
with that great company of yours?
I believe I will.
I believe you won't.

Uh, Sussex. I have a reservation.
Oh, yes, Mr. Sussex.
We've been expecting you.

Boy, that sure is a fancy-lookin' pen
you got there.
When shall I call

I'm not sure.
Sometime tomorrow. I'll let you know.

- No. Keep on going.
<i>Oh! Oh, God!</i>
Oh, God! God!
Oh! Oh. Oh.
Are you all right?
It's all right.
You're all right now.
We're on the fifth floor.
Oh, God!
Oh, Lord.
Oh. You're gonna be okay.
Oh. Oh.
Oh, Lord.
This good?
<i>You okay? Oh.</i>
Lord.
Oh.
Mister?
Mister? Mister?
Are you okay?
- Are you okay?
- I - I must have fainted.
Fainted? I thought you were dead.
I'll call a doctor.
No, don't call a doctor.
Mmm.
Hello.
- You know, you're not at all like my father.
- I'm glad about that.
You know, you're not
a bit like my father.
I'm glad about that.
- You've got more little wrinkles.
- Mmm.
You have a lot of lines
on your forehead and wrinkles.
<i>And things.</i>
And things.
- And more things.
- That's why you torment me.
- I'm probably older than your dad.
- Probably so.
That's why you tease me
so much, isn't it? Huh?
Well, I'm not
a lecherous old man.
You're a lecherous little girl.
<i>But no one
would ever believe it!</i>
Come on. Nobody would ever believe you.
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah.
Fuck Professor Canutti!
Fuck you!
<i>- Fuck you!
- Yeah! Yeah!</i>
<i>- Fuck Canutti.
- Yeah. Nobody would believe you.</i>
Do you think I could have
something to drink?
Are you sure you should drink?
- I'd like a glass of-
- Gin?
<i>A nice gin and tonic...</i>
with four cubes of ice
and a slice of lime.
How's that sound, mister?
<i>- Just a glass of water.
- No, no.</i>
I'll get it.
Do you want me to go down
and get some medicine?
<i>Maybe you should have
something with your water.</i>
Some kind of pill maybe?
Just the water.
What's your name?
Sussex.
Um, can I leave now?
I've got some cleaning to do.
I'll come back in a little while, okay?
You go ahead.
I'm all right.
<i>And then,
when I was 15...</i>
<i>I worked in this pharmacy
in a hospital...</i>
delivering medicine
to all the floors.
It was a real responsible job.
Boy, you're really hooked
on water, aren't you?
One of these days
you oughta try one of these.
Am I talking too much?
Maybe I oughta go.
Oh, Lord, it's after 3:00.
I guess you're tired.
Well, I'll just
finish this up and then -
And then?
And then I think
I'll have another one.
You know, I really like you, mister.
What do you do?
For a living, I mean.
Oh, I'm just visiting.
Oh, a traveler!
Could you help me up, please?
Sure.
Oh.
You know, mister,
I don't think you get enough to eat.
If you don't mind
my saying so...
I think you're too thin.
You're very thin.
You're too thin!
Do you come from a city?
<i>No, I come from the country.</i>
Ah.
<i>I wish I lived in the country.</i>
You know, this is
a very unhealthy place.
Water here is all polluted.
They put all kinds of chemicals in it
to keep people from gettin' sick.
It's a very unhealthy place.
I think it just takes
getting used to. That's all.
<i>It sure does.</i>
- Anyway, I -
- I wonder-
I wonder if you'd mind,
Mary-Lou, if I rested now.
Lord, no.
I was just leaving anyway.
I'll come back and see you tomorrow,
if you want me.
<i>I'd like to see you tomorrow.</i>
Perhaps you could arrange
to bring me a television.
TV? Nothin' easier.
Well, I'll be seeing you then, Mr. -
- Sussex.
- Sussex.
I don't know why, but I'll never
be able to remember that name.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you, Mary-Lou.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
<i>Just say you love me
like you used to</i>
<i>And make the world go away</i>
<i>They always seem to lead such interesting lives...</i>
<i>- people who travel.
- Make the world go away</i>
<i>People who write stories
must lead kind of interesting lives too.</i>
<i>- Get it off my shoulder
- I know I'll never be like a character in a story.</i>
<i>I'll just be like
everybody else.</i>
<i>Well, maybe, maybe, maybe.
I don't know.</i>
<i>- Maybe someday.
- And make the world go away</i>
<i>There are now
six subsidiaries under the holding company.</i>
<i>I don't know how accurate you want
the account figures, but they change hourly.</i>
<i>Yes, we receive bank statements
on each company twice a day.</i>
I want the total figure
by tomorrow.
Give it to me to the nearest
$50 million.
And the utility dropped very slightly.
The volume, 11,850,000 shares.
The average issues up -
<i>The more secretive you are
about your life...</i>
the more it arouses
people's interest.
We've had some chemistry professor
from Chicago...
who's been calling and writing.
That's not so terrible, Mr. Farnsworth.
<i>Why don't you talk to him? Don't be unfriendly.</i>
- Mary-Lou.
- 686 issues up. 568 down.
My life is not secret, Mr. Farnsworth,
but it is private.
Among the most actives today is World Enterprises.
Up five points on the day,
trading over 300,000 shares.
Wall Street analysts
and company officials report...
they know of no reason
for the sudden interest -
<i>For a whole year
I concentrated equally on two things:</i>
<i>Fucking and World Enterprises.</i>
<i>It was neck and neck.
Well, I have to admit that l-</i>
<i>It began to look like Canutti was right
because World Enterprises...</i>
<i>was evasive and slow to reply
to my persistent letters and calls and-</i>
<i>Suddenly, I got this letter
from Farnsworth.</i>
<i>I'd landed a job in the research department
of the fuel division.</i>
<i>Strangely, after that...</i>
<i>I gradually began to lose my interest
in 18-year-olds.</i>
<i>I don't know what happened to me.
I'm not sure.</i>
<i>But my mind had developed
a libido of its own...</i>
<i>and I didn't need the stimulation of legs
and so forth.</i>
<i>The salary was terrific too.</i>
<i>It was three times
what I'd been getting.</i>
<i>The first thing I did
is I ordered a French car.</i>
<i>This upset Canutti
more than anything else.</i>
<i>Last time I remember
feeling so exhilarated...</i>
<i>was 10 years back when I'd been
experimenting with heat photography.</i>
<i>It came to nothing, of course,
because academia got in the way.</i>
<i>But this time...</i>
<i>I knew I was gonna be given
a proper chance.</i>
<i>And you know how I knew that?
Because I had faith in myself.</i>
<i>What I didn't know then...</i>
<i>was someone else
had faith in me as well.</i>
<i>This will be your final call.</i>
<i>Continental Airlines,
Flight 241, the Golden Jet...</i>
<i>nonstop for El Paso,

<i>... service to Tucson and Phoenix.</i>
<i>Dr. Bryce.</i>
I'm Oliver Farnsworth.
Um, I thought you
were based in New York.
New York?
Oh, uh, not anymore.
I still keep an apartment there.
I've come to like it out here.
I think you will too.
It's got a lot of...
space.
That means freedom.
You know what I mean?
Yes, I do.
Then there's the job itself.
It will entail certain, uh -
Uh -
Well, you won't live
in quite the same way as you did before.
Of course, there's the salary.
<i>- Another adjustment.
- I know this is what I want.</i>
I hope so.
The sun is roughly
10,000 times larger than Earth.
<i>Anyway, I'm rather glad you're leaving tonight.</i>
<i>- You are?
- Makes everything so much simpler.</i>
That's the way it should be -
no involvements, no complications.
- No danger.
- None at all.
Hello, Tommy.
I got that white wine
you like from Reichman's.
It's not cold.
You want me to pour you a glass?
Why not?
- I suppose most girls
are sentimental about their first love.
Oh, I suppose so.
Like their first pair
of high-heeled shoes.
I don't understand how
you can watch them all at the same time.
You know, Tommy,
you're really a freak.
I don't mean that unkindly.
I like freaks.
That's why I like you.
Let me see. Uh -
I really like you.
Trouble is, people get
too attached to each other, things drag on.
Scenes, tears.
Everything gets so maudlin.
I think people should
always behave...
as though they were between planes.
- Very sound, Mr. Flannagan.
- Face it.
"He who loves and runs away
lives to love another day."
<i>- But it's not enough.
- I must remember that.</i>
I don't know why
you're living with me. Oh -
You don't need me.
Yes, I do.
First we'll have a drink.
Then I'll have a bath.
And tomorrow,
we'll go to church.
<i>It's all a little blurry.</i>
<i>- Lord, I love gin.
- Must have had too much of this
domestic champagne.</i>
- I can't go to church.
- Oh, come on, Tommy.
It's a real good church.
You won't feel out of place.
Makes me feel so good.
Gives me something to believe in.
Everybody needs that -
a meaning to life.
I mean, when you look out
at the sky at night...
don't you feel that
somewhere out there...
there's gotta be a god?
There's gotta be.
They're so strange here -
the trains.
Damn cheap rinses.
You can come in, Tommy.
Don't be embarrassed.
Are you hiding out?
<i>Well, then how come you told me
your name was Mr. Sussex?</i>
I didn't know you then.
- Are you married?
- Yes.
Thought so.
<i>What's she like, your wife?</i>
<i>Is she like me?</i>
No.
Didn't think so.
Well, I guess I'll do
for now, won't I?
We've handed song sheets
out today...
of an old English hymn...
<i>which I'd like you all
to try and attempt to sing...</i>

<i>Stand, please.</i>
And did those feet
In ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green
And was the holy
Lamb of God

And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon

Tommy. Tommy, look. A train.
<i>I like trains. I remember when Mama
used to put us on the train.</i>
I was about 10.
And we'd go to Oklahoma City
to visit Granny.
<i>The trains were really nice then.
They had concession stands...</i>
and they would sell, uh, magazines...
and candy bars
and sodas and -
<i>Then, about six years later...</i>
<i>I rode the train again...</i>
<i>and the concession stands were gone.</i>
<i>There weren't
too many people on the train.</i>
<i>There weren't any dining cars,
and the seats were all shabby.</i>
It's a shame.
I used to like trains.
What do you want to
take a picture of that for?
<i>For my scrapbook.</i>
I love our rides in the country.
Don't you, honey?
- What?
- Nothing.
<i>Pa! Look at that! Pa! Look!</i>
Lord, I never knew
America was so beautiful.
<i>This is beau-ti-ful.</i>
How did you find this place?
- Shall we build the house here?
- The house?
Oh, yes, yes.
Definitely yes.
It's perfect.
It is perfect.
Perfect.
<i>It's perfect.</i>
You all right, Tommy?
<i>Tommy?</i>
<i>Tommy?</i>
<i>Tommy?</i>
<i>Tommy?</i>
<i>Tommy?</i>
Tommy! Arthur!
Arthur!
What was it? What did you see?
You saw something.
<i>You all right, sir?
- I think we ought to
get Mr. Newton back to the car.</i>
<i>He's not a well man.</i>
What was that?
Are you sure?
Tomorrow morning I want you to start work
on a completely new project, Mr. Farnsworth.
I want the complete resources
of World Enterprises at my disposal.
What is the nature
of this project, Mr. Newton?
You'll have to recruit
some new men.
Get yourself some sleep,
Mr. Farnsworth.
Good night.
What does that mean?
- It's fantastic.
- What is?
Starting tomorrow...
we are embarking on
some sort of space program.
Space program?
What for?
- I don't trust him.
- I don't trust you.
<i>That doesn't alter
my feeling for you.</i>
Has he ever been wrong?
No, but he's a freak.
What do you see in the cards?
Nothing.
Don't forget your bag.
- Hey, thanks. That was great.
- Okay, sure.
- That all?
- That's it.
- Dr. Bryce?
- Yeah.
Your car's right outside the gate.
- Dr. Bryce?
- Yeah.
I've come to take you
to your laboratory and quarters.
Uh, I thought I was gonna work here.
It's not far, sir,
and it's much more comfortable.
I've been shuttled around so much
by this corporation, I should be used to it by now.
Thank you.
Is that Mr. Farnsworth's house?
No, sir. That belongs to Mr. Newton.
I can't seem to get dry.
Mmm. I'm still wet.
- I've got something for you.
- Oh, yeah? What?
A present?
You know you don't buy people presents.
Call it a prize.
A prize? What for?
I don't know.
Come on. I'll show you.
What kind of prize?
- It's yours, Mary-Lou.
- Oh, my Lord!
Move over.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Let me look.
- Let me dry that.
- Hair's sticking up.
<i>I know. You saw me looking
in that magazine, didn't you?</i>
It's all dark.
I love you.
You're such a nice man.
- Mmm!
- No, I'm not.
You want it puffy or tight?
- Puff it out a bit more.
- Okay.
I don't know if it looks good tight.
These are hard to stick in.
- Mmm. Where, where, where?
- What?
- Here?
- What?
- Oh!
- What?
A new suit came in.
It's not your color. It's blue.
- No.
- It's exactly the same style.
No, no.
- Damn it.
- No, I don't like it.
All right.
Well, I'll send it back.
- Come on, Tommy. You've had enough.
- I don't want to talk to anyone.
Tommy.
Tommy, what's happened to you?
What's happened to me?
What is this music Farnsworth
keeps sending me? I don't like it.
Some German composer.
I'd like to hear people singing.
Let's have... singing.
- Find some singing.
- People singing.
<i>I feel so bad
I've got a worried mind</i>
<i>- Let's talk.
- I'm so lonesome</i>
<i>All the time</i>
<i>Oh, don't turn on
those damn TVs.</i>
Come on, Tommy.
Talk to me.
Oh, I can't stand
what's happening to you, whatever it is.
Why don't you just tell me?
<i>The sun don't shine</i>
I hate - No, I don't.
<i>I love you.</i>

Hey! What the hell do you think
you're doing, you maniac?
All of you!
Corrected...
<i>my position...
by putting the stick forward.</i>
<i>Oh, hello.</i>
Mr. Farnsworth.
Yeah, it's Bryce.
Is everything all right?
Well, uh, to tell you
the truth, I'm baffled.
I've been here for so long, and I -
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
Oh, uh, and, Mr. Farnsworth,
about this, uh...
liquid gas problem, I -
I really must tell ya, I can't -
I'm afraid I know nothing about
liquid gas, Dr. Bryce.
What I've called to tell you is that Mr. Newton
will be visiting you the day after tomorrow.
Yes. Wednesday.
He will be able to answer
all of your questions.
No, I'm afraid...
he's away at the moment.
Ah. Well, thanks for calling,
Mr. Farnsworth.
Tomorrow, Dr. Bryce.
- Huh? Who are you?
- Don't be suspicious.
- Hmm?
- Mr. Newton sent me to collect you.
This way, Dr. Bryce.
Mr. Newton has been away,
hasn't he?
<i>Yes, sir.
He come in this mornin'.</i>
<i>Mr. Newton is waitin', sir.</i>
Dr. Bryce? I'm Newton.
<i>We've met before. I -</i>
Mm-hmm.
How are you getting on?
Have you found your feet yet?
Well, not yet.
Not - Not really.
Well, I'm here to help you.
I believe we -we share a common interest,
Mr. Newton: Photography.
Hmm. My interest is energy.
Transference of energy.
Oh.
- Transference of energy.
- Yes.
Well, I know it's gonna be very exciting
working with you. I -
I've looked forward
to meeting you.
I've thought about you
once or twice.
This -This is some kind
of space vehicle, right?
Well, what for?
Is it a solar probe?
I want you to think
beyond that.
I want to show you this
because I value your contribution to my work.
Well, I'm not certain
what that's to be.
Fuel conservation, Dr. Bryce.
It may be the key
to our project.
- Ask me.
- What?
The question you've been wanting
to ask ever since we met.
Are you Lithuanian?
I come from England.
Oh, that's not so terrible.
Is this a weapon?
- A weapon?
- Well, it's too small for interplanetary travel.
You assume that it's a weapon?
- Does that matter to you?
- Yeah.
If I thought that you were
building a weapon...
you were employing me to help you,
I'd have to quit the project.
Don't be s - suspicious.
I know people think me
unnecessarily secretive.
If I were you,
I'd be secretive.
Would you be
comfortable in here?
I think I'd last about 20 minutes.
And then?
I'd start screaming.
Wouldn't everyone?
Last night, I was watching television.
I saw these, uh, ex-astronauts.
Some of them are
basket cases now.
Television.
The strange thing about
television is that it...
doesn't tell you everything.
<i>It shows you everything about life on Earth...</i>
<i>but the true mysteries remain.</i>
Perhaps it's in
the nature of television.
Just waves in space.
Do you trust me, Dr. Bryce?
I think so.
- That's not good enough.
- It's the best I can do.
<i>Let's put it this way.
Uh, I want to.</i>
You see, Mr. Newton, I'm kind of a cliché.
I'm the disillusioned scientist.
That goes with the cynical writer,
the alcoholic actor and the spaced-out spaceman.
A man like you wouldn't
understand a guy like me.
I'll try to, Dr. Bryce.
Well, anyhow, uh...
<i>"Per ardua ad astra."</i>
I beg your pardon?
That's Latin.
Latin?
You must know that in England.
<i>- Royal Air Force- their motto.
- Yes.</i>
<i>"Per ardua... ad astra."</i>
<i>"Through difficulties, to the stars."</i>
It's very hot today.
I appreciate your coming all this way to see me.
Would you say we're getting close
to an understanding?
I'm afraid not, Mr. Peters.
That's a pity.
We seem to have spent
so much time on this question.
<i>You must understand,
World Enterprises sees itself as a loner...</i>
a pioneer, if you will.
We have that get-up-and-go spirit.
Frankly, what you're suggesting
sounds like interference.
I beg you to reconsider,
Mr. Farnsworth.
The world is ever-changing,
like our own solar system...
and a corporation the size of yours
has a duty to recognize that fact.
One must keep up,
Mr. Farnsworth.
The way I see it,
Mr. Peters, I'm way ahead.
It's going to be hard.
<i>I'm concerned about
the recovery program.</i>
Don't be.
"Don't be"?
Mr. Newton, are you crazy?
Same as before?
So many good and worthwhile
products from World Enterprises.
Gin. Uh, neat, no ice.
- Right?
- That's it.
<i>We help you to a better life.</i>
<i>W.E. Film turns a little moment
into a great event.</i>
<i>The colors are beautiful.</i>
<i>The film is W.E.</i>
<i>It has to be.</i>
We do it for you.
Free camera with each 12-pack.
<i>- A division of World Enterprises.
- Turn it off.</i>
W.E. Film is self-loading,
self-focusing -
<i>Self-exposing. Self-developing.</i>
<i>- No light necessary.
- Is there a malfunction?</i>
- We do it for you.
- No, I don't think so.
- May I see it?
- With W.E. Film, what you see is what you get.
<i>Sometimes it doesn't seem to work.
I gotta get some ice.</i>
<i>And, remember, don't throw
your W.E. Camera away.</i>
<i>If your camera should break,
just drop it in your nearest W.E. Litter bin.</i>
It will be recycled for you.
World Enterprises
works for you, for us.
It's a great partnership.
WE and US.
<i>World Enterprises
and the United States, together.</i>
...result of the same cold front that brought
heavy snow to the Rockies earlier this week.
Hardest hit by the wet weather
have been the Southwestern states...
<i>including Texas, Nevada,
Arizona and New Mexico.</i>
<i>New storm predictions
have been issued for other areas as well.</i>
<i>- A low pressure system moving-
- May I look at it?</i>
<i>- Hmm? Oh, sure.
- ... is bringing thundershowers there...</i>
<i>as you can see
from a spiral band of clouds.</i>
<i>And the bright clouds
over Minnesota and Iowa-</i>
There's yet another stormy area
in western Texas, Oklahoma -
Seems to be all right now.
...ahead of a trough
over the eastern Rockies.
Why does the guy on the, uh,
W.E. Commercial look like you?
<i>Funnel clouds, hail
and 100-mile-an-hour winds-</i>
Does he? Hmm.
He's just a family man.
Our W.E. Products
appeal to families.
Are you a family man?
- Where are they?
- They live in Los Angeles.
Why aren't you with them?
I'm separated from my wife,
but I see my daughter.
A man should spend time
with his family.
Hmm.
<i>In these circumstances, we have to take action.</i>
Well, I talked with Farnsworth.
He just cannot, or will not, see it our way.
The problem with this corporation
is that it is, uh, technologically overstimulated.
And the economic trouble
stems from that fact.
Then you must go further.
They have to take a wider view.
What kind of measure
would you say is appropriate?
Well, we're flexible.
Something, uh, elastic.
<i>But, remember,
we're not the mafia.</i>
This isn't an archaic
Italian joke.
We're determining
the social ecology.
This is modern America,
and we're going to keep it that way.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, okay.
Tell me. How long will it take
to complete the fuel tank?
You mean... to construct and all?
- Everything. How long?
- About 15 months.
That's too long.
It's too long.
<i>Why? Why is it too long?</i>
<i>You put alcohol in my drink.</i>
Fuck.
<i>You can stay on here. The house is yours.</i>
I've transferred enough
to your bank account.
I don't want the house or your money.
I want to be with you.
I can't explain it
to you completely.
But if I stay here...
I shall die.
What do you mean?
Take me with you.
I'll see you don't die.
I can't stay.
You're an alien!
<i>Do you know what would happen
if they found out your visa had expired?</i>
You don't know.
How could you? You're simple.
You don't understand
how we live here.
Oh, come on, Tommy.
Don't go now.
Give us another chance.
You won't find
anyone else like me, you know.
You won't find anyone
who'd do for you like I've done for you.
It's your wife, isn't it?
I bet you she's no bloody good.
Ooh.
I don't care what you are
or who you are, I -
No! I can't let you go! Not now!
Oh, Tommy.
Tommy.
Tommy.
Tommy? Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Tommy, can you hear me?
<i>Tommy! Let me in!</i>
I lifted you up once.
You must believe it, Mary-Lou.
<i>Why?</i>
Why?
<i>Why? Why?</i>
You must hate me.
No, I don't.
I don't hate anyone.
I can't.
Your wife's out there somewhere.
<i>She's waiting for you, isn't she?</i>
<i>And your children-
they must miss their dad.</i>
<i>What are they like,
your children?</i>
They're like children.
Exactly like children.
Fuck.
- Hello, Mr. Newton.
- Hello, Dr. Bryce. I'm glad you came.
I hoped you would.
I realize you've made
certain assumptions about me.
I can see the flash
of an X-ray camera.
<i>It's blinding.</i>
Why'd you come here?
Where I come from,
there's a terrible drought.
We saw pictures of
your planet on television.
We saw the water.
In fact, our word for your planet
means "planet of water."
You watched it all on television?
Where exactly do you come from?
Well, I'm not an astronomer, but...
somewhere down there.
Are you the - the first?
The first what? Visitor?
There have always been visitors.
On my own planet we found
evidence of visitors.
You must have seen them here.
No, I don't think so.
Well, I've seen them.
I've seen their footsteps
and their places.
I've seen those things.
We've all seen them. That's for theorists.
- I'm a scientist.
- Well, I'm not a scientist.
But I know all things
begin and end in eternity.
What are you gonna do?
- You mean, Dr. Bryce, what's in my mind?
- Yeah.
What's in your mind?
Don't worry.
I don't want to hurt you.
Turn that down, will you, Trevor?
Would you like a drink?
No.
I don't like to see you like this.
Get out - now.
Leave the company, Oliver.
We don't need Newton.
I feel sorry for him.
<i>Sorry for him?</i>
Why?
Because he can't help it.
Well, you know Mary-Lou's still
living in the house.
I've seen her a few times.
How is she?
She knows, doesn't she?
Mmm.
I trust you both.
<i>What's the time?</i>
<i>It's late, past midnight.</i>
<i>Is time on my side?</i>
<i>This is a unique moment...</i>
<i>in the history
of space exploration.</i>
<i>Never before has one man planned to travel
single-handed to the stars.</i>
<i>It isn't a question of one man, Alan.</i>
<i>Here we have the head of the World Enterprises
Corporation himself manning the spacecraft.</i>
<i>- Yes, Peter.
- Here he comes.</i>
<i>This has given rise to widespread
speculation about possible repercussions.</i>
<i>That is to say, if anything
should happen to Mr. Newton-</i>
<i>And now, over to our economic
adviser in Washington, D.C. -</i>
<i>I don't want the money. I want my Tommy.</i>
<i>- Here's the check, Mary-Lou.
- I don't want it.</i>
No. No.
How do you feel about the progress
they're making here?
Well, I think it's quite fantastic.
It's a breakthrough - a real breakthrough.
<i>There it is. He's coming now toward the gate.</i>
<i>He's coming, surrounded by
his fellow men-his workers.</i>
<i>He seems to be in a jubilant state.</i>
<i>There's widespread feeling that
Mr. Newton's latest experiment is wasteful.</i>
- This is the amount.
- No! I don't want it!
<i>... result in any special benefit
to the nations of this Earth.</i>
I don't want it! I want Tommy.
<i>I can see Commander-</i>
- Good luck. I wish I could go with you.
- Thank you.
<i>Tommy! Oh!</i>
<i>... Farnsworth as to the purpose
of Mr. Newton's mission.</i>
<i>All that anyone has yet said about it-</i>
<i>and that was said by Mr. Newton's associate,
Dr. Nathan Bryce, was that the mission-</i>
I want Tommy.
I want him.
<i>Are you confident that you'll be a success?</i>
<i>... all seems to heighten
the whole enigma of Mr. Newton himself.</i>
<i>This amazing man is not only
the owner of World Enterprises Corporation...</i>
<i>but he's also the inventor
of its most exceptional products.</i>
<i>Where he comes from
is as mysterious as where he's going.</i>
<i>- He's not in fact an American citizen-
- I've got an hour, Arthur.
Take me back to the house.</i>
<i>... but is the bearer of a British passport.</i>
<i>Thank you, Mary-Lou.</i>
<i>But from research done by my colleagues
in the U.K., it's unclear...</i>
<i>- as to Mr. Newton's true background.
- I want Tommy. Tommy.</i>
<i>I hesitate to say that this is an important
moment in the history of our country...</i>
<i>but it is certainly
an extraordinary one.</i>
<i>There's no parallel to be found with
what this man has done and is now doing.</i>
<i>It's difficult to compare him with anyone.
He is unique.</i>
<i>We have all, strangely enough,
relied on Mr. Newton, who is, after all-</i>
- How many does she take?
- Thirty-five.
<i>They call him "The Killer from Panama."</i>
Don't bother.
Oh.
<i>Durán, trying to work around, makes
a right hand and staggers the Mexican out-</i>
Arthur.
Arthur, can you hear me?
- Arthur!
- I haven't got the time now.
Hello, Mr. Farnsworth.
Well, I knew it had to come.
It had to come, didn't it?
What are you doing?
What? Don't take my-
Those are my eyes!
Don't take my-
Wait a minute now. Wait.
People will know! They'll talk!
Get -
Let me see you!
Stop a minute.
- There you go.
- No... more.
More.
I won't believe it.
- Listen, I haven't got -
- Give me his other arm.
I haven't got the time.
W-Wait.
Let's -
<i>It's not that different.</i>
<i>Won't you let me
see your face?</i>
<i>Goddamn it.</i>
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.</i>
<i>Two left hooks
and a short right buys a run on the champion.</i>
<i>With the body.
Look at that hook.</i>
<i>Out with his right hand.</i>
I've changed my mind.
There's nothing to worry about.
I know who you are!
Where are you taking me?
<i>Now we're gonna
put you guys to bed.</i>
Here we go, big guy.
Oh. You got a kiss
for your dad? Huh?
Okay.
I wonder if we do
and say the right things.
To the children?
No. Everything.
<i>He has just been appointed
special adviser to the new administration...</i>
<i>on matters of economic development
in the chemical industry.</i>
<i>Professor Canutti,
are there any major new developments...</i>
that have taken place
recently, Professor?
Well, as we all know,
a giant corporation, which had become...
<i>- Good morning, Mr. Newton.
- a household word in this country...</i>
<i>- Good morning, Albert.
- ran into financial difficulties.</i>
- The main reason for this was the corporation...
- I feel so tired.
- How about a nice, refreshing martini?
- Relied heavily on...
that two-headed monster: Innovation.
Now, the American consumer
can assimilate...
- only so many new products
in a given period of time...
- Just the way you like it.
- Not too cold.
- And then no more.
There. Now, it's a beautiful day.
Oh.
Thank you, Arthur.
You know, if all of you drank less,
we'd get better results.
Take my advice and stick to mineral water.
Keep your perspective.
I'll talk to him.
I know he'll be all right.
I'm not sure. We've got a serious
unemployment problem on our hands now.
<i>The media...</i>
are beginning to hint
at a... fraud.
<i>People need reassuring...</i>
and they've got
a right to the facts.
<i>- I understand, Mr. Peters.
- Well, I'm not quite sure...</i>
<i>you understand...
how all this might affect you.</i>
- Nate. Help me, Nate.
- Don't worry, Mr. Newton. You're perfectly normal.
<i>Help me, Nate.</i>
I do. That's a fact. That's a fact.
- It's been such a long time, Nate.
- Mm-hmm.
Do you really think I look nice?
It's really good to get out, you know.
Mmm. Have you seen him?
No, I, uh -
They're keeping us
away from him.
You have seen Calloway.
What are you two doing?
Well, they-
they asked me to help take him.
I'm helping.
Poor Harry.
"Poor Harry."
<i>"Poor Harry"wouldn't even
lift a finger to help you.</i>
Poor Tommy. We haven't
helped him much, have we?
I think maybe
we have a chance now. They-
They might let you, uh, see him.
Alone that is.
I don't want him anymore.
I don't want to see him, hear him,
but he's still a part of me. That's a fact.
I don't want to
hurt him anymore.
Poor Tommy's been hurt enough.
I know, but, uh, well, I might be able to
arrange for you to talk to him.
Maybe you, uh -
you can save him.
Save him?
From what?
Good evening, Mr. Newton.
Would you take off your pajama jacket, please?
- How long will I have to stay in this place?
- I have no idea.
It probably depends
on why you're here.
<i>- Oh, Anna, why do we always-
- I'm a surgeon.</i>
<i>- This is just a little test.
- have to quarrel?</i>
<i>- If you want to sell your services-
- Would you drop your trousers?</i>
I've told you everything.
- I loved him. You loved him.
- You're just gonna hurt me again.
- This won't hurt. Trust me. Hmm?
- What good have we done him? Love.
<i>Nurse.</i>
Okay, Mr. Newton.
Point your toes in, please.
Okay. Take a nice, deep breath now.
Okay, hold it.
That's fine.
I told you before.
I came alone.
<i>I came alone.
Nobody saw me.</i>
Oh, Tommy.
My sweet baby.
Oh, I never thought
I'd see you again.
Oh, you look so beautiful to my eyes.
Oh.
- Do they know?
- Know what?
About you.
How did you get in here?
Through the front doors.
The double doors?
Where are you -
Where are you going?
You never get sick.
What happens to you
when you drink?
I see things.
What things?
Bodies.
Bodies? Women?
- And men.
- Men!
Men?
<i>Mmm! Mmm! Bad boy!</i>
I want it.
I've been dreaming of it.
Please.
Do you know what I think?
What?
I think you know -
You know too much about me.
What do you mean?
I can do anything...
now, you know.
I can kill you...
right here on this bed.
Then I could...
phone room service.
And they'd - they'd take
your body away...
and then I'd have them
send up another girl.
Oh, Tommy. Tommy.
I just want it
to be like it was.
Me, the two of us.
You. You.
The way you were.
That's the way I am!
It's too late, Mary-Lou.
I can't trust you.
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.
- Good-bye, Mary-Lou.
- No.
<i>- Sleep well!
- No! No!</i>
<i>Hello, Mary-Lou</i>
<i>- Won't they come in? The noise!
- Good-bye, heart</i>
<i>Sweet Mary-Lou
I'm so in love with you</i>
No. They gave me the gun
and the blanks. I asked for them.
- And I asked for you, and here you are.
- Oh. Ooh.
<i>Good-bye, heart</i>
<i>- You passed by one sunny day
- Please. Please.</i>
<i>- Flashed those big brown eyes my way
- Yeah.</i>
<i>How I wanted you</i>
<i>Forevermore</i>
Bite it.
Why are they doing that,
giving you everything?
<i>Though I never did meet you before</i>
<i>- I say hello, Mary-Lou
- They're not really giving me anything.</i>
<i>- I'm paying. I'm -
- Good-bye, heart</i>
- I'm rich.
- Yeah.
<i>- I'm so in love with you
- I can afford anything.</i>
<i>I knew, Mary-Lou</i>
<i>- We'd never part
- You like that?</i>
<i>So, hello, Mary-Lou</i>
- Push.
- Let me get up. Let me get up.
Here, you shoot. You shoot.
- Yes, higher. Come up here.
- I like that.
Oh!
- Yes.
- Oh, please.
Oh, please,
O noble sire.
<i>- Hello, Mary-Lou
- Oh, that's awful.</i>
<i>Good-bye, heart</i>
<i>Sweet Mary-Lou
I'm so in love with you</i>
<i>- Yes. Yes.
- Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.</i>
<i>Oh, don't you-</i>
<i>So, hello, Mary-Lou</i>
Oh. Ahhh.
- Yes.
- Mmm.
Say your prayers, boy.
Give me a kiss.
<i>Mmm. Mmm.</i>
<i>You don't want to go back. Not really.</i>
You've got everything here.
Tell me one thing
that you have on your planet -
Whoo! -
that we don't have on ours.
Come on. Tell me one thing.
<i>You don't have any money.</i>
You don't have any water.
You don't have any grass.
You don't have any booze.
<i>Mmm.</i>
<i>What do you want
to go back to a desert for?</i>
<i>If you want desert,
we got deserts here.</i>
This country's rich.
We got everything.
<i>All right.</i>
<i>I know.</i>
<i>Your wife and your family.</i>
But by the time you get back,
they'll probably be dead.
<i>I mean, how long is it gonna take you
to get back from here, Tommy?</i>
<i>How many years?</i>
Light-years, or whatever
you want to call 'em.
How many?
All I'm trying to say,
Tommy, is that...
<i>if you could just prove
who you really are, you'd be free!</i>
<i>Don't you understand?
They don't understand you.</i>
<i>They don't believe you.</i>
<i>Believe me.
They think you're one of us.</i>
<i>They think you're
a freak or a fake.</i>
I know you're not.
All you have to do
is just prove it to 'em.
Let 'em see you
as you really are.
Listen.
Nate could probably
make a deal for you.
I'll bet you
you could probably go back.
They'd probably let you go back.
I'm sure they would!
You could get into that little rocket ship
of yours and go back!
Huh?
No.
- What do you mean, no?
- No.
Come on, Tommy.
Show 'em.
Prove it to them.
Come on.
- Prove it.
- No, I don't want to. I've proved enough.
I've proved everything I'm gonna prove.
I've gone as far as I'm going.
I don't love you anymore.
And I don't love you.
You're gonna die like an animal.
Just an animal,
a stupid creature.
I want to give you something.
Here you are.
It's my last present.
It's the only thing
that's really mine to give.
I don't want it.
Why not?
It doesn't fit, Tommy.
It doesn't fit!
It doesn't fit!
Now we're going to take
some photographs of you.
- That's all right, Nurse.
- Very straightforward.
The first picture will be
a routine photo of your retinas.
- That's for a simple identification
of your blood vessel pattern.
- What are you doing?
And the other is
an equally straightforward X-ray.
That's so we can see the ridges
on the inside of your occipita -
<i>- You don't understand. The flash of an X-ray-
- Nurse, will you please-</i>
<i>- This won't hurt at all. I assure you.
- There's no flash with an X-ray.</i>
- You can't see an X-ray.
- I can.
- I can see X-rays.
- Here, drink this.
<i>I can see something.
Are you wearing contact lenses?</i>
<i>- I can see something inside there.
- Please don't hurt my eyes.</i>
Tweezers, please.
No, you won't be able
to take them out.
I've been dealing with lenses
for 20 years. It won't hurt.
I'll do it.
Don't touch my eyes.
Give me the tweezers, please.
- Hand me the tweezers.
- No, I can't let you do it. I can't.
Give Mr. Newton another drink.
Please don't do it.
Please. I beg you.
<i>- Please don't be excited.
- Call Dr. Bryce. He knows.</i>
- Call him.
- I don't know who Dr. Bryce is.
- I want to go home.
- Yes, yes, of course.
- I want to go home.
- Very soon now.
- Finish your drink.
- Please don't do it. You don't understand.
<i>- All right, Doctor. When you're ready.
- Mary-Lou!</i>
- I'm ready.
- Help me! Don't!
No. No!
They're stuck. They're stuck.
I'll never get them off.
<i>Twenty, 19...</i>
<i>18, 17-</i>
<i>16, 15...</i>
<i>14, 13...</i>
<i>12, 11 -</i>
<i>Can you imagine the cost? Spaceships!</i>
<i>Why the hell do they have to build
these things anyway?</i>
- Stand by. Five seconds.
- It's such a waste when people - I don't know.
- It's such a waste of money.
- Destruct!
<i>Zero.</i>
- I'd like another one, please.
- All right.
Honey, I'd like to try this.
<i>Oh, I'll get it.</i>
<i>- How much, please?
- 26.86.</i>
Thirty.
Change.
<i>- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Uh-huh.</i>
One.
Two. Want a drink?
Mmm. Why not?
Three.
<i>- Four.
- I give to you</i>
<i>- And you give to me
- Oh, shoot!</i>
<i>True love</i>
I believe Christmas
is less commercial this year.
<i>So on and on</i>
<i>I'd like to go someplace for Christmas
where it's real hot.</i>
<i>- Tropical.
- True love</i>
<i>True love</i>
<i>- For you and I
- I guess I must be feeling the cold.</i>
<i>Have a guardian angel</i>
<i>On high</i>
<i>With nothing to do</i>
<i>But to give to you</i>
<i>And to give to me</i>
<i>Love</i>
<i>Forever true</i>
<i>I think that love is comin' back</i>
<i>I think romance is on the rise</i>
<i>And all across the world</i>
<i>All the boys and girls are making eyes</i>
Could I listen to a track off this?
Yeah. Let me see.
Yeah, sure.
Come this way.
<i>There you are.</i>
Thank you.
Mr. Newton?
- Nathan Bryce.
- That's right.
May I sit down?
Hmm? Go ahead.
Strangely enough,
I was thinking of you just the other day.
<i>How did you find me?</i>
Your record.
- Hmm?
- It took me a while, but I traced you.
<i>- Did you like it?
- Not much.</i>
Oh. Well, I didn't make it
for you anyway.
<i>Who'd you make it for then?</i>
For my wife.
She'll get to hear it one day...
on the radio.
We hear most everything
on the radio these days.
Do you see anything of Mary-Lou?
Not much.
I don't want her to get lonely.
<i>She must still have enough money.</i>
Don't you feel bitter
about it - everything?
Bitter? No.
We'd have probably treated you the same
if you'd come over to our place.
Is there no chance then?
Of what?
Of course there's a chance.
You're the scientist, Dr. Bryce.
<i>You must know
there's always a chance.</i>
<i>Do you need money?</i>
Let me know if you do, will you?
I may not see so well anymore -
Still have money.
<i>Oh!</i>
Ah.
I think maybe Mr. Newton
has had enough, don't you?
I think maybe he has.
Ah.
