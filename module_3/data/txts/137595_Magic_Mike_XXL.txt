let's get this circus back on the road.
Who wants to see if Tarzan died
in his sleep last night?
<font color="#808080">RICHIE:</font> Fuck that.
I woke him up last time.
I'll do it. I got it.
I'll clean up the nonbiodegradables.
<font color="#808080">TOBIAS: </font>What's up, bro?
A little, uh, breakfast of champions?
- <font color="#808080">MIKE: </font>Molly?
- <font color="#808080">TOBIAS: </font>Yeah.
<font color="#808080">MIKE: </font>You realize
we'll be useless in an hour.
<font color="#808080">TOBIAS:</font> What are you, 12? Just take it.
Argh. Fuck! All right, fine. Guess I know
what today is going to be like.
All right, get your moon rock!
So, what's the plan about this thing?
We got it all planned out.
Tobias will warm up the crowd...
then we'll hit them
with the old 4th of July Army routine.
That makes me feel like a warmonger with
everything going on politically right now.
Oh, come on with the hippie shit!
It's in season. We're doing it.
Hey, if you want that karma, go for it.
We'll hit them with "Raining Men"
right after.
Right. Then Tobias is gonna
intro the solos. Listen...
I think you should
bring back "Pony," bro.
I could do that.
And, look, "Pony" is great.
I have... Uh, can I pitch you something?
Let me just throw something out.
I completely understand that...
I'm coming in at the eleventh hour,
and I don't want to step on toes.
But what if...
If this really is our last ride, what if we make
up some new shit and go out with a bang?
Just burn this shit down
with some new routines.
We can't do that. We got two days.
Mike, that's what we've rehearsed.
- Don't call our shit lame.
- Right. I'm not calling your shit lame.
I'm just saying that cowboys and firemen
dancing to '80s rock is not not lame.
You know what is lame? Looking like a bag of
dicks because we don't have our act straight.
Okay, point taken.
Let me ask you a question, though. Um...
You're still doing
the fireman routine, right?
- You know it.
- Have you ever wanted to be a fireman?
- A real one?
- Yes, a real fireman.
- No, I got the phobia thing.
- You have a fire phobia, okay.
- You still doing it to that KISS song?
- Fuck, yeah. "Hotter Than Hell."
- Do you like that song?
- Crushes.
I know it crushes, but do you like it?
Do you play it when you're not onstage?
- I don't see your point.
- My point is, if you don't like it, why pick it?
I didn't pick it. Dallas did.
Exactly. You didn't pick it,
so it's not on the inside.
Just because you made up some
of your own routines...
doesn't mean you get to waltz back in
and tell us how to run our own shit.
- I'm not trying to tell you...
- No!
There is no fucking universe in which
I am not doing that fireman routine!
<font color="#808080">MIKE: </font>You can find it, man.
You got to just let go, okay?
- I fucking got it!
- <font color="#808080">MIKE:</font> What?
- It's like a real wedding except like a fantasy.
- <font color="#808080">MIKE: </font>Oh, my God!
Then I go out in the crowd
and find myself a real fucking bride.
- Oh, fuck!
- And I do everything with her!
I'll have a ring and everything, and I'll
propose to her, and people throw rice.
- They're throwing rice!
- <font color="#808080">KEN: </font>Rice out of our pants!
- You're fucking incredible!
- It's just so complex.
<font color="#808080">KEN: </font>What are you talking about?
Yo, man, I'm not a dancer like you.
I just can't come up with shit on the spot.
It's not about being a dancer, Richie.
It's not.
Okay, look.
"Pony," that wasn't a dance routine.
All it was is I was at a party
and saw this badass girl.
She was with her boyfriend, and he did not
look like he was hitting that shit right.
So that song came on, and all I did
was imagine what I would do to her.
That was it.
That was all "Pony" ever was.
- It sounds fucking complex.
- No, it's not.
Look at you! You're a fucking Greek god.
You could tie your shoe
and make some girl's entire year.
It's just got to come from in here.
You just have to be you. I know so.
You know what? Fuck that.
I bet you can go in there right now
and fucking make her day.
- <font color="#808080">RICHIE:</font> Who, her?
- Hell, yeah.
That girl looks like she never smiled
in her entire life.
Then that's your goal.
That is your goal.
Go in there and make her smile,
that's all you've got to do.
If you can't do that, no one can,
and I'll go back and do the old routines.
- Oh, fuck!
- That's a fair deal.
You're not a fireman, Richie!
You're not a fireman.
I want to hear you say that.
"I am not a fireman."
- Well, I'm not a fireman.

I had the house, the dog,
Downton Abbey on the weekends.

And for whatever reason
that I'll probably never understand...
she wanted something else.

I started out as the Donald Duck understudy,
but I was playing Mickey by my second year.
I got signed by an agent, booked
a couple regional commercial spots.
One day I heard an ad
on the radio looking for dancers.
And you know how that shit goes, so...
Heh-heh.
When I started this, I thought...
man, I thought I'd hate it.
But now, if the E.P. blew up tomorrow...
I'd probably still do this on the side.
- I'm serious.
- You're shitting me.
Do you see how many girls
I meet every day? For free?
For free! I don't got to pay for dinner.
All I do is sing.
Think about that.
These girls have to deal with men
in their lives every day who...
don't listen to them,
don't ask them what they want.
They don't even ask them what they want!
All we got to do is ask them
what they want.
And when they tell you,
it's a beautiful thing.
We're like healers or something.
Yes, man.
- Fuck, yes!
- We are.
- That's right.
- We're healers.
We're healers, man.
We can be. We can be.
I like that.
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem.
- Good talking to you. Safe home.
- Look us up when you get back.
You sure this is the place?
I'm positive. She said it,
and I got the text.
Looks like somebody hooked up
with a trust fund baby!
I just hit her with her favorite flavor,
baby, and we're living large.
Megan?
Hello?
Megan?
There's some law of attraction
going on here.
Megan! It's Tito! Hey!
Oh, shit.
Who are you?
- Just, uh, friends of Megan.
- Ah.
Is Megan here?
My daughter and her friends are outside.
Who are you?
Oh, you're having a party.
We'll just go out. Megan is back this way?
You hold on.
Y'all can't just walk in my house...
like strangers
without having a hello drink.
<font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHS)</font>
You come on now and have a seat.
What you want? You want red?
You want white?
We got whiskey. We got shine.
Y'all get some. Ha-ha.
How about we start with wine
and end with shine?
- I like that rule.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Why don't you come sit right here?
Come on.
- Oh, shit!
- Thank you so much.

- Listen to him!

You're good!

Sadly, I was too naive to recognize
that he was a gay man.
Mom, you don't know that.
I knew enough. I knew he liked it
when I put my fing...
Mom! I don't want to hear that.
- Well, you need to!
- It's not so terrible.

Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?
A lady is about to get...
I don't even know
how to put it into words.
No, I'm a cookie guy.
What?
- Yeah.
- It's red fucking velvet.
I would take a pack of Oreos
over that bullshit any day of the week.
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong. Cookies are awesome.
I don't think we have anything
to say to one another.

I don't know if it's about New York,
but I intuit it might be...
I'm going to start hiding
the kitchen knives in a minute.
Seriously, it is that obvious.
What's up?
I met a photographer in Miami
at this party I was working at.
He was nice and married and all of that.
Took a look at my photos
and said I had an eye.
Offered me a job right there
on the spot as his assistant.
That's cool. Did he offer
a place for you to stay as well...
that happened to be his house
when his wife was away?
That...? Yeah.
Wait, were you there?
I was there, but in drag.
You wouldn't have recognized me.
- Mm.
- But I just want to throw this out there.
Um, this might be God's way of giving you
a second chance at Myrtle Beach.
Mm. Any God worth believing in certainly
sends you dudes in thongs when in need.
Or she just knows
that some asshole in Miami...
- She?
- Yes, my God is a she. Um...
She just might know that...
some asshole in Miami stole your smile,
and you need it back.
And I can guarantee you
that strippers...
will give smiles a-plenty
and make you forget about New York.
And if that doesn't work,
then there will be 3000 women there...
seeing as you're not in a boy phase.
- That was quite a pitch.
- Mmm.
When shit's not going your way, getting
a little crazy with some random friends...
has a way of helping you
sort out your own shit.
So I'm your friend now?
You've seen me pee. I don't know anyone
that's not my friend that's seen me pee.
Fair enough.
Look, I don't normally
trust a cookie guy...
but I'll think about it.
That's valid.
All right. You think about it, Dolly. I'm
going back in there and feed the wolves...
because it's getting
a little rabid in there. All right?
