<i>[ Man ] At exactly 4:30 P.M. on June 3
at 33 Union Square West,</i>
<i>two males were shot
by one female.</i>
<i>One of these males was</i>
<i>Andy Warhol.</i>
Jesus Christ.
Now she's shot somebody.
I-I always thought Andy was a great artist.
He made three films with me.
My most recent role was, uh,
in <i>' I, a Man '</i>
where I lie
on the floor naked...
while discussing
the philosophy of love.
Uh, perhaps you've--

I am not surprised.
Violence today is in the air everywhere.
Andy got hurt
in the big game of reality.
You know, the wonderful thing
about Andy, of course,
he was life plus, plus, plus.
It's a fascinating thing

You are Valerie Jean Solanas ?
Solanas.
That's right.
And where do you live ?
Nowhere.
Where do you come from ?
The river.
[seagulls]
[Children laughing]
Miss Solanas, you don't have
to answer any of my questions
if you don't want to.
Do you understand that ?
Mm-humm.
Instead of saying 'mm-hmm,' because
she has to take it down, on the machine,
could you say either yes or no ?
Yes.
- All right.  Now...
knowing what your rights are...
knowing that I'd like
to ask you a few questions
about what happened yesterday,
do you want to tell me
what happened ?
Yes.
You tell me in your own words
what happened.
Very simply,
I shot him.
Who did you shoot ?
Andy Warhol.
What did you shoot him with ?
A gun.
- That gun ?
- Yeah, .32 caliber Beretta.
Why did you want to shoot
Andy Warhol ?
Well, that's somethin'--
no, no. That's very involved.
I don't want to
get into that right now.
You don't have to get into
anything if you don't want to.
Do you know on what
part of his body you shot him ?
Well, according to the papers,
it was a chest wound.
And nat-naturally, I was--
I was sort of like,
to the side.
And-and I thought that
I was shootin' from like here.
What did you need
the ice pick for ?
Oh, I actually been carryin' that on me
for several days
and I didn't intend to use that.
I brought it with me.
I'd been carryin' all my things in a bag,
including the ice pick,
which I'd forgotten.
Why did you want to shoot
Andy Warhol ?
I told you.
I don't want to get
into that right now.

<i>[ Woman ] The patient is
a 28-year-old single woman</i>
<i>who was admitted
to this hospital on June fifth.</i>
<i>She was born and raised
in Atlantic city, New Jersey.</i>
<i>She describes a rather pitiful childhood,
including parental conflict,</i>
<i>sexual molestation by her father
and separation from her home.</i>
By the age of 13,
she had many sexual experiences.
It was about this time,
her mother remarried for the second time.
At age 14, she was sent
to boarding school
where she stayed for about 2 years.
It was here that she had her first
homosexual experiences.
At age 16,
she returned home.
Her schoolwork improved
and it was noted
that she seemed to possess
exceptional intellectual ability.
- <i>- Over here, Val.</i>
<i>- This way. Right here.</i>
<i>- Where'd you get the gun ?</i>
- In Vermont.
Is it true you were an actress
in Warhol's movies ?
Yeah, but I'm really a writer.
<i>Would you consider this</i>
<i> a-a political assassination ?</i>
No.
<i>- What'd you write ?</i>
<i>' SCUM Manifesto.'</i>
Oh yeah ?   Are you a member of some
revolutionary organization ?
- Yeah, my own.
- Why did you shoot Andy Warhol ?
Yeah, yeah,  I have a lot
of very involved reasons.
Read my manifesto.
It'll tell you what I am.
[ Man ] Do you have copies of
any of the school reports ?
I have this.
In 1954,
her high school principal
wrote a letter on her behalf.
"I understand that Valerie Solanas
needs a letter of recommendation."
<i>[Man]
Valerie, you got a boyfriend ?</i>
[ Man ] "She's proved
to be an exceptionally bright girl
with lots of
courage and determination."
<i>So, do you consider yourself
a revolutionary ?</i>
<i>[ Man ] "Valerie's a highly responsible
and dependable person,</i>
<i>"well suited to the study of psychology
at university level.</i>
<i>"She possesses much initiative</i>
<i>and always meets her obstacles
by setting new goals."</i>
[ Valerie]  <i>"The male is
a biological accident.</i>
<i>"The "Y" male gene,</i>
<i> is an incomplete "X",</i>
<i> or female gene.</i>
<i>"It has an incomplete set</i>

"It's now technically possible
to reproduce without the aid of males

On the subject
of student vandalism,
I've been told that 100 ashtrays
have been taken
from the Student Union
following its opening.
After the pep rally on Saturday,
someone unscrewed all the mirrors
in the men's room
and would have taken the mirrors
had they not
been glued to the wall.

"or should one be worn
at more casual affairs ?
"I think it would be helpful to

"if the university

An earth-shattering dilemma.
Yeah, it is a tricky one.

Miss Solanas entered
the University of Maryland
in 1954,
and completely supported herself
during the next four years,
during which time she earned "A"s
in her major of psychology.
During the summers of her
third and fourth college years,
she made money by prostitution,
while living a homosexual life
for enjoyment.
She tells us
for the last five years
she knocked around
and lived with several men,
none of whom she liked.
For many years,
the patient has been
developing an interest in
the natural superiority
of women over men.
Within the past three to four years,
she decided
to put her thoughts
on paper.
" 'Life' in this 'society' being,
at best an utter bore
"and no aspect of 'society'
being at all relevant to women,
"there remains to civic-minded,
responsible, thrill-seeking females
"only to overthrow the government,
eliminate the money system,
institute complete automation
and eliminate the male sex."
I have two dollars and six cents.
Man, I'm so bored with turning tricks.
I hate money.
Why do we have to need money ?
I need money
so I can get a room somewhere.
I'm sick of sleepin' on roofs.
Come on, let me
just stay with you, Stevie.
Hey, Sheila,

Are you kidding ?
My girlfriend would kill you !
Yeah, I know.

just to survive.

My God,

Oh, thank you.
A lot of people say that.

- Yeah.

TV interview going on now.
Oh, great, great.
Can I watch ?
No visitors today,
but  just leave me the script.
I'll make sure Andy gets it.
- No, no, no, no.
I gotta give it to him personally.
- Andy's a very busy man.
No, I really want to
give it to him personally.  Yeah.
No, I'm sorry.
- All right.
Look, I only have one other copy.
All right ?
If anything happens to this,
there's gonna be trouble.
Yes ?        - Yes.
All right, You promise ?
Yes, I promise.
- You promise ?    - I promise.
All right.  Just give--
All right.  Goodbye.
-  Bye.
<i>' Up Your Ass '</i>
 by Valerie Solanas.
"Time:
the present afternoon.
"Place, a large,
American city, the sidewalk.
"Bongi Perez.
"She is loitering outside the steps
of the building where she lives.
A broad passes by."
Hello, beautiful....
Stuck up, bitch.
Oh, aren't we the high-class ass.
What do you got ?
A twat by <i>Dior</i>  ?
Say, Miss,
have you by any chance
seen a turd around here ?
Well, what does this turd look like ?
Is it blue ?
- Uh, no, no.
- Is it-- is it green ?   - No, no, no.
Is it red ?              -  No, no, no,
it's a little yellow turdlet.
Well--    <i>- "Not to be nosey"--</i>
- I know. I know.  Not to be nosey.
Not to be nosey, but does this
turd have sentimental value ?
Oh, don't be absurd.
It's for dinner.
Oh.   Well, what's it doing
rollin' around out here ?
Uh--
<i>"I took it out
to have it dyed yellow."</i>
Oh, I-I--
I took it out
 to have it dyed yellow.
It must've dropped out of my bag
on the way in.
"Do you often serve turd
for dinner ?"
"You're really too much.
Would you want to be eating
turds all the time ?"
This is really sick.
"You do have a point there."
- [ Candy ]  I'm having company tonight.
I'm having these two
really dynamic,
fascinating men over for dinner,
and I want to make
the best possible impression.
"So you are
serving them a turd."
Oh, you're impossible.
I can assure you,
I have no intentions whatsoever
of serving my guests a turd.
The turd is for me.
"Everybody knows that men
have much more respect for women...
who are good
at lapping up shit."
Say, would you like
to join us for dinner ?
Cut !
You're in a restaurant,
not on Broadway.
- Order somethin' or get out !
- Oh, come on.   - Eh!
And stop blockin' the exits.
[ Andy ]  What do you-- what do you--
you know,  what do you think ?
- Oh, this is kinda fun.    - Yeah.
- Oh no it's not!    - [ sigh ]
In fact, it's way too disgusting,
even for us.
[ Andy ]   Whoa !
Well, I thought we could use
some of the dialogue at least.
[ Exhales ]
Brigid didn't like it.
[ typewriter clacking ]
"Presentation of the rationale
"and program of action of <i>SCUM,</i>
'Society for Cuttin' Up Men'.
<i>"Unhampered by propriety,</i>
"niceness, discretion,
public opinion,
"morals, the respect
of assholes,
"always funky, dirty, low down,
<i>SCUM</i>  gets around...
"and around and around.
"They've covered
the whole waterfront,
"been under
every dock and pier,
"the Peter pier,  the Pussy pier.
"You've gotta go through a lot of sex
to get to anti-sex.
"And <i>SCUM</i> 's
<i> been through it all.</i>
"And now they're ready
for a whole new show.
"They want to crawl out
from under the dock.
Moved.  Take off.
Sink out."
Yeah.  How much is
a room here by the week ?
Twenty-five dollars.
Oh. Great.
Mmm.  Twenty...
five.
Be cheaper if
you paid by the month.
Well, I'm not gonna.
Can you put me through
to Maurice Girodias' room ?
Mr. Girodias is away
for a few days.
Mmh.
Well, can I get a bellboy
to help me with this stuff ?
You are joking, aren't you ?
You know, you're friendly.
Did you know that ?
Yeah.
- Good-bye.   - Yeah.
Yeah, this is
Valerie Solanas.
Yeah, I'm callin' again
about that play I left with ya.
<i>'Up Your Ass'.</i>
Yeah, okay.
Well, is Andy there ?
Oh, all right.
All right.  I-I'll call back.
[ Gerard ]  Well, ultimately, we--we
couldn't find a subway anywhere.
We-we passed this Chinese restaurant;
hadn't eaten all day.
[ Andy ] Yeah.
- [ Gerard ] And, uh,
we just went in for a minute.
And then it just, you know,
it went on and then--
I-I'm sorry I wasn't there.
Gerard, is this true ?
Well, I-I--
like I said, I was--
You were on your way there
and you just decided to stop.
We were on our way--we were on our way
to the subway.
We didn't even think that, uh--
- You just stopped.
- This-this fabulous Chinese restaurant.
We went in for a minute, ended-up having
a conversation.   - Well, I was hungry.
[ chuckles ]  And Viva paid for it ?
- <i>Yeah, she had a check.</i>     - Really ?
- Do you ever pay for dinner ?
- When-when there's cash involved.
Andy Warhol ?
I'm Valerie Solanas.
I sent you my play,
<i>'Up Your Ass'.</i>
Oh, yeah.
Oh, um,
I'm, uh--  it's such a great title.
It really is.
But, uh, I remember your play.
It's so dirty.
Yeah.  It was so dirty
we thought it was some kind of entrapment.
Yeah, we thought
you were a lady cop.
Yeah. Yeah.  Sure I am.
Here's my badge.
Oh...  ah,
uh, would, uh--
would you like to do a screen test ?
- Yeah.   - You would ?   -Yeah, when?
- Really ?
Could, uh--  could we do one now ?
- Yeah.
That would be great.
Let's, uh--
- Well, let's get it set up.
Come this way.
 - Sure.
- Come over here.
I, uh, I want
to move out of here,
and really get things organized,
get rid of some of the craziness,
move full time
into producing films.
It's all about personality.
The better the personality,
the better the movie.
Andy used to make some films
where you could spend four hours
watching some man eating a mushroom,
but, then, he likes that, you know ?
A mushroom ?
Mushroom.
Billy, are we ready ?
I think we're moving in a direction
that's more entertaining.
These are some of
our screen tests.
W-we're ready.
We have so many, uh,
fabulous personalities.
The factory is a lot like
the old  <i>MGM</i>  star system.
Are you serious ?
Oh, certainly.
We believe in stars.
Our kids are actually very similar
to the, uh, Walt Disney kids,
except, of course,
that they're modern children,
so naturally,
they take drugs and have sex.
[ Jackie ]
Look, it's Adonis.
<i>Mary, where's your little lamb ?</i>
<i>Where is that lamb ?</i>
Give me that, Ondine !
That Guinea prick.  Give it to me.
How large is her lamb ?
[ Ondine ]  The duchess, oh my God,
desperate for attention, as usual.
[ Jackie ]  You are
an evil bovine-porcine pig,
but Andy
likes to have her around.
I don't know why.
[ Ondine ]   Cecil B. DeMille.
The bargain basement.
[ Jackie ]  Pfft.
I think you look
very handsome there, Paul.
[ Jackie ]   Handsome.
- We have got to get rid of him.
[ Ondine ]   Utterly vile.   Look, she's
practicing her arithmetic skills.
One.
<i>One.</i>
One. Honey,
two comes after one.
You look lovely there, dear.
Mmm. Feathers.
Iris !    - Surprise !
- She's signalling <i>Bellevue.</i>
[ Jackie ]  She usually wears
a straight jacket and we don't see those.
[ Ondine ]
Ah, now she is fantastic.
[ Jackie ]
My friend, Candy, is... fantastic.
She is so real.
- Oh, she gets realer and realer...
And realer.
What is that
horrendous monstrosity ?
<i>[ Ondine ] Isn't she tragic ?</i>
<i>[ Jackie ] look at her hair.</i>
<i> It's so mannish !</i>
[ Ondine ]
That-that's that man hater.
I-I-I don't know
what Andy sees in her.
[ Jackie ]
Maybe Andy feels sorry for her.
Poor thing.
She won't last.
Andy, Andy, it's me.
Andy, look. Yeah.
[ Andy ]  Gee, you have really, uh,
really powerful eyes.
- Yeah ?
- <i>Yeah, you really do.</i>
Yeah.  Yeah.
I look all right.   All right.
Yeah, you know, Andy,  I-I really think
you oughta produce the play, you know.
 Have you finished it yet ?
Uh, gee, Valerie, um, you know,
I'm sure it's fabulous.
I-I mean, Andy,
I really think you gotta produce it.
I mean, with your flair for publicity,
you know,  we-we could make a fortune.
You know,  we could start
off-Broadway,
you know ?
- Broadway ?  Wow.  That'd be great.
I need some more actors.
Yeah, I'll-I'll put an ad in the newspaper.
Yeah, one of the underground rags.
That's what I'll do.
"Wanted.  Hip girl typist,
part time, East Village area,
groovy, unbusinesslike atmosphere."
That sounds fun.
You can't type, honey.
How 'bout this ?
"Wanted, a young, shapely girl
"Who wants to supplement
her income easily
"By dating affluent, but busy bachelor,
occasionally in his apartment...
teenybopper okay."
I'm not a teenybopper.
I want to find the ad for Valerie's play.
I'm playing the ingenue.
Oh, here it is.
"<i>SCUM,</i>
Society For Cutting Up Men,
"is looking for garbage-mouthed dykes,
butch or fem,
"with some acting ability,
"experience not necessary,
"to appear in garbage-mouthed
dykey anti-male play,
a comedy called
<i>'Up Your Ass' </i>."
Valerie.   Is that
the smelly bitch
dyke torrid whore who
lives down the hall from you ?
She did,
but she got kicked out.
She couldn't pay her rent,
so she moved somewhere more expensive.
The Chelsea...
very artistic.
"Also looking for talented
garbage-mouthed pretty,
effeminate-looking males.
If interested in trying out for a role,
call the Chelsea hotel."
She's nutty.
- Oh, she's fine.
She's a little funny about men,
but she'll like you,  Jeremiah.
You should call her.
Call her.
[ ringing ]
- Hello ?
Ah !  Hello ?
Hello, can you hear me ?
I'm having trouble
with my phone.
Yeah, I can hear you.
Um, I'm calling about the audition.
Oh, okay.
Uh, meet-meet me in the lobby
of the Chelsea hotel,
tomorrow at, um, three o'clock
and I'll read you.
W-what's your name ?
- <i>Jeremiah.</i>     - Jeremiah.
All right.  And, uh, what do you
look like, Jeremiah ?
<i>I'm tall and
I have long brown hair.</i>
What do you look like ?
A butch dyke.
[ hangs up phone ]
Use an ashtray, please,
Miss Solanas.
Fuck off, creep.
And would you fix my phone ?
Hi, are you Valerie ?
- Yeah.
You Jeremiah ?
- Yeah.    - Okay.  Yeah.
Come on in my office.
Just don't
touch the steam pipes.
Hey, I'm not gonna kill ya.
I just don't want to take you to my room,
'cause you'll damage
my reputation.
All right.
Here.
All right.  You read Russell.
Start at the top.
"No. The two-sex system
must be right.
"It survived hundreds
of thousands of years."
So has disease.
"You can't just
determine us away."
Come on.
"We won't allow it.
We'll unite.   We'll fight."
All right.  Well, eventually you may
have to resign yourself,
because the expression
"female of the species"
will eventually be
a redundancy.
"You don't even know what a female is,
you de-sexed monstrosity."
On the contrary.
I'm so female, I'm subversive.
[ Jeremiah ]  Your play kinda seems,
uh, controversial.
[ Valerie ]
Well, of course it's controversial.
I mean, it's time for controversy.
I mean, the wrong species
has been ruling the planet
for way too long, you know ?
It's time for the truth
to be told.
Do you get what I'm sayin' ?
- Not really.   - No ?
For example, look at
the shitty war we're in.
If a woman was in charge,
it would never've happened.
I'm expectin' my draft papers
any day now.
Women are real,
they're human.
I mean, men aren't
even complete human beings.
The male gene
is an incomplete female gene.
Now that's why he's got this
built-in inferiority complex
and always pullin'
those lousy stunts.
Can I have a lemonade ?
- [ Woman ]  <i>Just a minute.</i>
Do you want-- do you want to kill
all the men in the world ?
No. No.  I don't think
that would be necessary.
What about drag queens ?
What about drag queens ?
I mean,
they want to be women, so--
What ? Do you mean if you got a sex change,
would that mean you're okay ?
No, 'cause you're
still a man.
That's not what makes
a woman a woman.
Hormones.
There's more to it than that.
And look at Candy Darling.
Here you have a perfect victim
of male oppression.
Piffle.
[ speaking French ]
Andy,  hi.
- Hi, Fred.  How are you ?
Good. Allow me the pleasure of introducing
the Contesse de Courcy.
This is Isabelle de Courcy,
my cousin.
[ Fred ]  They're interested in
seeing some of your work,
so I thought we
could take a walk.
Oh, great.
Yeah.
Is she very, very rich ?
Filthy.
Did you see the diamonds ?
[ indistinct ]
[ chattering ]
[ Brigid ]  I keep them in descending order
depending on whether I've
cut-off the other end because
I use them for all kinds of things,
like when I call up
the delicatessen.
Anyway, what I was saying--
What are these wonderful,
white capsules,
the white
with the blue speckles ?
Oh, my dear,
Those are called Adipex.
- Is this methamphetamine hydrochloric?
It's the same as Zoxin.  It's a brand name.
- Who are you ?
I'm stuck with these
20 milligram biphetamines,
but they make me feel so funny.
- Do you have any Obetrol ?
- Hands off !
Uh, those are orange ones,
ten milligrams.  Divine.
These are the ones, my dear,
that my mother gave me
when I was 13 years old.
<i>- You're kidding ?</i>
<i>- She sent me to a Park Avenue doctor.</i>
My pediatrician
on Park Avenue--
[ indistinct chatter ]
<i>You call this</i>
<i>a groovy light show,</i>
I'd rather sit and watch
the clothes dryer at the laundromat.
Oh, look.   It changed color.
Where's-where's a love child ?
They'll get a kick outta this.
Only a hippie would find this
even remotely interesting,
but I'll tell ya, you spend one day
with the hippies
and you realize how truly
refreshing and unpretentious,
hard core,
New York degenerates are.
The body of Christ.

I think it's fabulous.
I think it's such
a daring statement.

What do you think of--

Oh, hello, Fred.
How are you ?
Uh, this is Ondine,
one of the ah, greatest actors...
- So proud to meet you.
...in underground film today.
- Oh, that's very kind of you to say,
because most people
consider me a vulgar pig.
Don't mess it up !
...  least of all women's,
you shouldn't be having sex at all, right ?
- Absolument.     - Absolutely.
- Absolute, yes.
And for the last time,
what the fuck is a gay bar ?
Can you tell me ?
[ speaking French ]
What is that ?
As a homosexual,  I will not go.
I will not go to one.
Why should I be segregated ?
You're right.
You should be isolated.

Ah, yeah, I got the manifesto right here.
Here, for free...
Here for free, for free.

They do absolutely nothing.
You know what I dig ?
I dig, um, round, pink, uh, Prelude.

Gee, everyone was having

W-would you say something for me ?
<i>- What ?</i>
Yeah, I'm, you know--
I have, uh,
like an hour's worth of,
uh, on tape here, you know,
and I was just wondering maybe
you could just do a,
you know,
like a monologue for me?
No, I mean, I-I can't
just monologue like that.
I mean, I need a stimulating person,
like yourself, you know, to talk to.
I-I can't just do it
on my own.
Oh, come on, Valerie.
Say somethin' dirty.
It's so easy for you.
- Yeah, well.
<i>Just talk about sex.</i>
Sex is really nothing,
isn't it ?
I could read you somethin'
from my latest masterpiece.
<i>'SCUM Manifesto' .</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah ?    - Yeah.</i>
"Sex is the refuge
of the mindless.
"Sex is not part of a relationship.
On the contrary.
"It is a solitary

a gross waste of time."
Wow, that's so true.

- Yeah.
"The female can easily, far
more easily than she may think,
"condition away her sex drive.

you should shoot me from this side ?

Your mail, Monsieur Girodias.
- Thank you so much.
And the little matter
of your rent.

my dear Charles,
I'm so sorry.

These damn people are so unreliable.
You know how it is.

Oh, Valerie.
Yes, of course.
I'm ready to write
that novel.
Call me next week
and we'll arrange to have dinner ?
Yeah, okay.

I'll prepare a contract.

talk to her ?  It's Valerie.

It's a burning piece of literature.
It's fifty cents for you,

Well.   You want some ice cream ?
- No, no.

Yeah.
I'm so impressed.
Oh, you should
come type for us.

You dyke.    You're disgusting!
So, Andy, are you
gonna produce my play ?
I mean, you really oughta do it now,
you know,
It's gonna cost you a lot more
when I'm famous.
Some big-time publisher
wants me to write a novel.
Oh,  oh really ?
Well, that's great.
Did you hear that, Viva ?
 Valerie's gonna be published.   - Really ?
Yeah.
His name's Maurice Girodias.
He's French.

Oh, look at Candy, Valerie,
isn't she fabulous ?
- [ Fred ]   Mmm, fabulous.    - Oh!
Oh, you ought to get her

produce my play ?
Oh, Valerie, we're so busy
right now, you know ?
Well, can you just give me an
advance at least ?
Oh, Valerie, get a job.
I mean,  you know--
Come on, Andy.  You know that's
against my principles.
Come on, just give me an advance.
If you come to <i>The Factory</i>
tomorrow,
um, I will put you
in our movie,
and that way you can earn the money,
you know, instead of panhandling,
and, ah,  we'll give you
twenty-five dollars.
Yeah. All right.
That's great.
You'll give me something to
tie me over till then ?
Oh, I don't--
does anyone here have any money ?
Five bucks
or something.
No one ? Well, how are we
gonna pay for dinner ?
Well, here, I have
five dollars.

Thanks, Andy.
I'll see ya Thursday.

Bye, Candy.
- Bye.

<i>So, Candy,</i>
<i>we've been wondering,</i>
how often do you get
your period ?
Every day, Andy.
I'm such a woman.
The reason that we need that
added light is because
without the light,
his face would turn into a big fuzz ball,
another spot of dust on the lens;
which, of course, may be good.
Oh, I like that.
Do you like that ?
No, I don't.
Well, I mean, it's-it's-it's--
it's your production, so--
I mean, it's your choice.
Oh, but I like that.
Don't you like that ?
Yes, I do.
It's your choice.
It's such a strong face.
Look. Okay.
- Could we-could we start ?
- Yes, yes.  Victor ? Okay.
Uh, let's get him to do
something really modern.
Okay.
Okay, take
your pants off.
Yeah, but--
yeah, but have him do it again.
Okay, put 'em back on.
Yeah, so, you know,
it's the same, but different.
<i>Okay, turn around</i>
<i>and take 'em off again.</i>
We're gonna shoot it
from a-a different angle.
Oh, God, I hate morning.
It is morning, isn't it ?
- I hate morning.  I hate morning.
- It's not her scene.
- Good morning, darling.   How are--
- It's all right.

Yeah, I had to.
Yeah, he had too much control
over my life.
<i>[ Woman ]  In regard to the incident
on June 3, the patient says,</i>
<i>"I shot Andy Warhol.</i>
<i>He is trying to steal
all my work."</i>
<i>She says that she is glad
that he is in the hospital...</i>
<i>And hopes he dies.</i>
<i>She also complained that,</i>
<i>"if Andy has
really forgiven me...</i>
<i>why hasn't
he been to see me ?"</i>
<i>Dear Stevie,</i>
<i>everyone's married,
and I plan to also.</i>
<i>Yes, Stevie, I've decided
to be sex changed.</i>
I'm too female
to be half and half.
There's a very good book
written on the subject...
By Dr. Harry Benjamin,
<i>the transsexual phenomenon.</i>
I think you should read it.
Let me know what you think
about this step I wanna take.
You asked about writing
to Valerie Solanas.
I think you should.
I know she did a terrible thing,
but she has paid,
or is paying for it.
And I'm sure she needs a friend.
It's very thoughtful
and kind of you,
and you should do it.
We got another one
of those letters.
[ Valerie's voice ] <i>Dear Toad:
Your secret agent knew where I was</i>
<i>Because of the transmitter
in my uterus.</i>
<i>You told him to tell me you don't
want me to write you anymore.</i>
<i>I know you live for my letters.
What else is in your grim, puny life ?</i>

- Just a second.   Excuse me.
Carlos.
- Fred, how are you ?
- Fine.
Um, we're waiting for Liz.
Has she shown up ?   [ indistinct ]
[ loud pop ]
What's wrong ?
- Oh, uh--  no, nothing.
- Hi.
- Yeah, we're all together.
- The whole group ?
- Yeah.
[ Valerie ]   <i>"As for the issue of whether
or not to continue to reproduce males,</i>
<i>"it doesn't follow
that because the male,</i>
<i>"like disease,</i>
<i>"has always
existed among us,</i>
<i>that he should
continue to exist."</i>
"Why produce even females ?
"Why should there
be future generations ?
"And what's their purpose ?
"When aging and death are eliminated,
why continue to reproduce ?
"Why should we care
what happens when we're dead ?
"Why should we care
if there's no younger generation
to succeed us ? "
