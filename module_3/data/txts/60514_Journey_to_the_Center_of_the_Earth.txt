Congratulations.
Thank you.
It's a wonderful article
in the paper about you, Sir Oliver.
Wonderful, Sir!
Good morning, Professor,
or I should say, Sir Oliver.
Long article about you
on page two.
Is there? Well, well, well.
I think they made a mistake
about your age.
Paper! Paper!
Paper! Paper!
Paper!
Aye, it's such an honor
for Edinburgh, Sir Oliver.
I cannot take
your money.
Thank you.
Paper! Paper!
Congratulations,
Professor.

Sorry.
Sir Oliver,
since you've been
created a knight,
I've given your
students a holiday-
a day for a knight,
so to speak.
First, however, there's
to be a presentation.
Will the lad
of Glen Darrick step forward?
Sir Oliver,
in the name of the whole student body,
in gratitude for the knowledge
you have imparted to us-
That's enough
obituary prose.
An inkwell, I presume.
A very handsome thing.
Hellish to dust.
I thank you all from
the bottom of my heart,
and now, off to
the playing fields, all of you!
- Yay!
- Yay!
Ah.
It cost £4.17.
I was on the committee
that made the collection.
I thank you for your efforts, McKuen.
£5 was subscribed.
That left three shillings.
You're not going to
give me the change,
are you?
I expended it on this,
a little extra token
I thought you might fancy.
I saw it during Easter week
in a window in Glasgow,
a curiosity shop.
It seemed to whisper to me,
"Buy me for Professor Lindenbrook."
Aye, what did you reply?
I said, "Only if you can
be bought for three shillings."
I had to argue with the owner
all through Good Friday.
It's lava, of course.
Mm-hmm.
But exceptionally heavy.
It could serve
as a paperweight.
Do you like it,
Professor?
It's a scholar's choice.
Where are you eating tonight?
Oh, this being Tuesday,
I'm not eating.
- Oh?
- I find it healthy to eat
only every other night.
Be at my house at 8:00.
I'm entertaining some
members of the faculty.
Professor,
I do not think I could.
What's the matter with you,
McKuen?
You used to come to
my house quite regularly.
Is it those frayed cuffs
that are worrying you?
I won't get back my other shirt
from the wash till Friday.
8:00 sharp!
We're scientists, aren't we?
That's one society where
frayed cuffs don't matter.
<i>We've all had 'em.
Yes, Sir Oliver.</i>
8:00.
Lava?
I swear there's
something inside.
There's Uncle now, Kirsty.
And high time too!
I-I thought it was
Uncle Oliver.
I want it thoroughly understood
not a single stitch I'm wearing
belongs to me.
Good evening, Miss Jenny.
Good evening, Alec McKuen.
I'm early. But I trust
I'm not too early.
I didn't know
you were coming.
Well, your uncle-
I should say, Sir Oliver
ordered me to come.
Oh, where is he?
He's never been late
like this. Never.
I don't know,
but to return to the subject
of my clothes,
they're the property
of my classmate,
the young lad of Glen Darrick.
"You can't go to dinner
dressed like that,"
said the young lad.
"The professor knows
my wardrobe," I replied
and went to take my bath.
Uh, when I returned,
my clothes had been confiscated
and these substituted.
I want to make it clear,
I have no claim to
the Glen Darrick tartan.
You've explained
your magnificence.
Kirsty, there will be
one more guest.
I'll seat you between
the dean and the rector.
Couldn't I sit next to you?
Certainly not.
You'll pardon my being personal,
Miss Jenny,
but I notice
a certain harshness
in your attitude toward me.
What attitude do you expect when
it takes a command from my uncle
to bring you to this house?
Miss Jenny,
why should I torture myself
and on purpose?
Two years more I have to study
for my master's degree,
then four years more
as a laboratory assistant.
Then there's the money
I have to give back
to my relatives.
They're paying
for my schooling.
You are very logical,
Mr. McKuen.
It's the logic of an empty purse.
How like a Scotsman!
I am a Scotsman.
I know of one whose purse
was not empty,
because he didn't even
have a purse.
His name was
Robert Burns.
Do you know what he said?
Miss Jenny,
the time of poetry is over.
If this is true,
Alec McKuen,
what are you doing
with your hand on my knee?
Miss Jenny-
Now you just wait in there.
Kirsty, I'll set
the extra place.
Is there something
you want?
- Uh, a key is stuck.
- But that's impossible.
It was just tuned
last month.
Which one?
This one.
Can't you see?
No, I can't.
At least you can see
how unhappy I am.
You know how I've felt
ever since that first day
you entered the classroom.
Brought your uncle
the galoshes he forgot.
You looked like spring
itself.
♪ My love is like
the red, red rose ♪
♪ That's newly sprung
in June ♪
♪ My love is like the melody ♪
♪ That's sweetly
played in tune ♪
Miss Jenny, I thought
you were settin' the table.
There's a key stuck.
Mr. McKuen is fixing it.
♪ My bonny lass ♪
♪ So deep in love am I ♪
Shh.
♪ That I will love you still,
my dear ♪
♪ Till all the seas go dry ♪
♪ Till all the seas go dry,
my love ♪
♪ And the rocks
melt with the sun ♪
♪ And I will love you still,
my dear ♪
♪ While the sands of life
shall run ♪
♪ So fare thee well,
my only love ♪
♪ And fare thee well a while ♪
♪ For I'll come back to you,
my love ♪
♪ Though it were
10,000 mile ♪♪
Miss Jenny,
you're crying.
I-I bent over the goose.
The fumes.
Good evening,
Miss Jenny.
G-Good evening, gentlemen.
We were just worrying about
Professor Lindenbrook.
Yes, we were.
Isn't he with you?
- Isn't he here?
- No.
Careful it doesn't
go too high, Paisley.
It's just about the limit now,
Sir Oliver.
I gave no permission
for visitors!
Oh, it's you, McKuen.
Good lad.
You can lend Paisley a hand.
Uncle Oliver,
your guests are waiting.
If you don't come,
the goose will be
completely spoil-
Oh, goose,
goose, goose.
Tell him, Alec.
This lump of lava
you gave me
is 1 in 10 million.
I've been at it all day.
Aye, without a pause
for lunch or tea.
You've had three semesters
of petrology. Now then,
from which volcano could
this piece of lava
have emerged?
Fujiyama?
No.
Mt. Etna?
Very close.
The Mediterranean.
The Lipari Islands group
off the coast of Italy.
But theirs
is a very light lava.
That's exactly
what stumped me,
because inside
must be something
the weight of the heaviest rock
in existence.
But professor,
that would be
Icelandic peridotite.
Precisely.
There's a piece
chipped off.
By me.
What's the rock inside?
Icelandic peridotite,
naturally.
When I saw this,
I stopped chipping.
There's some marks
on the surface.
It looks like a letter
or some notches.
Three notches made
by the hand of man.
But how could
a rock from Iceland
possibly pop out of
a volcano across the world?
What's your conclusion?
Science does not
jump to conclusions.
Science is not
a guessing game.
We're going to melt off
the crust of lava.
Mr. Paisley.
Add 10 cc of aqua regia.
Not too fast, you know.
I shall write to Professor
Goetaborg of Stockholm about this.
He's the world's leading authority
on volcanoes.
How long
is all this going to take?
A typically female question.
To melt lava will take as long
as it takes lava to melt.
Maybe two hours.
Maybe four hours.
Two hours?
Four hours?
Maybe the whole night.
Who cares?
Jenny!
Are you all right?
That was entirely
my fault, Sir Oliver.
I don't know how it
could have happened.
Mr. Paisley, by your slip
you've rendered
an inestimable service to science.
Alec!
See this?
What would
you call it?
As you said,
it's a man-made object.
It looks like a-a top,
a surveyor's instrument,
a plumb bob.
<i>Not only looks like.
It is a plumb bob.</i>
There are letters on it.
It's an inscription,
a message, perhaps.
Can you make out
what it says, Professor?
It's in some
Nordic tongue.
The hand that
wrote this trembled.
Perhaps it was
a dying hand.
I wonder what it's written in.
Paint? Ink?
Perhaps blood.
Possibly.
Look at this side, sir!
A signature!
Arne Saknussemm.
Arne Saknussemm!
I hope it isn't too much to suggest
that you take me home now,
Uncle Oliver.
Or do I have to
go alone?
Alone. Alone!
It's unthinkable,
but it must be true.
A man took some tools...
and went where no human being
has ever set foot-
alone into the interior
of the earth, alone.
Who? What is
he talking about?
Arne Saknussemm,
the Icelandic scientist.
The greatest of his day.
He was laughed at
when he claimed there must be
some kind of a world down below.
The laughter stopped
when he disappeared,
never to be heard from...
until tonight.
Get out of here, woman.
I didn't ask for tea!
I don't want any tea!
All I want is my post.
<i>There's no use shouting at me,
Sir Oliver!</i>
I can shout
just as loud as you can!
For the past two weeks,
you've had nothing to eat,
and you haven't slept.
Out, woman!
Here's your post,
Uncle Oliver.
Another day,
and still nothing!
Can you believe that?
No answer.
And where is Alec McKuen?
He went to the university
in case there are some letters there.
How long does it take for a letter to
get from Stockholm to Edinburgh?
Answer the bell.
Did it ring?
We have to speak
to Sir Oliver.
And don't tell us
he's busy.
Callers?
Callers! That's all I need.
Oliver, we all know
your reputation for rudeness.
You also have a reputation
as a conscientious man.
But you've skipped
every lecture in the past two weeks.
I'm involved in something important.
More important
than our university?
Something any university
in the world would envy us.
Ah, yes!
You laugh!
What does the name
Arne Saknussemm mean to you?
Saknussemm, Saknussemm.
Wasn't he the one who wrote
about the lost city of Atlantis?
That was an early
phase of his career.
His real fame rests on
his study of volcanoes.
Out of a volcano
came this message from him.
It lay unnoticed
for 100 years
was probably picked up
by some peasant,
gathered dust in a curiosity shop
till it came to me.
Here is a translation
of the words.
"I am dying, but my life's work
must not be lost.
Whoever descends into the crater
of Sneffels Yocul
can reach the center of the Earth.
I did it.
Arne Saknussemm."
The center of the Earth?
Sneffels Yocul?
That's an extinct volcano
in Iceland.
According to this, there must be
a direct route from it
to a region no man has ever seen.
But Oliver,
this is sheer fantasy.
You haven't heard all of it.
There's a postscriptum.
"At sunrise
on the last day of May,
the mountain Scartaris
will point the path."
What do you say now?
I'm more mystified than ever.
Scartaris?
Scartaris is a mountain peak
near the volcano.
This is some kind of student's hoax.
You should know better.
Wait a second, rector.
Let's not take that tone.
Let's assume it's authentic.
Isn't the correct
procedure
to write a paper
and submit it
to the university officially?
You must consult
other experts.
A thing like this
needs verification.
Here is my paper.
I've written to
the foremost authority in Europe.
The Royal
Geological Society?
More eminent still.
Professor Goetaborg
of Stockholm.
Oh? And what
does he say?
Unfortunately, I've not yet
received his reply.
I've written to him twice!
Well, then, I suggest
we relax on the matter
until your famous correspondent
sees fit to answer you.
In the meantime, we could do
with a cup of tea.
I know you two
think I'm daft!
Think whatever you want!
Jenny, tea!
When did you get here?
Just this moment,
Sir Oliver. Look.
It's from Stockholm.
Well, he's got his letter
from Stockholm.
Did you see the shine
in his eyes?
There'll never
be a better moment than today.
I'm going to tell him about
our feelings for each other.
He'll say yes
almost inadvertently.
What if he says no
advertently?
You wait and see
how firm my voice can be
when I speak of you.
Blast and damnation!
The devil blast it!
What is it, Oliver?
Don't keep us
in the dark.
Bad news, sir?
I am stricken.
The University of Stockholm
informs me
that Professor Goetaborg
has vanished from Sweden.
His disappearance
follows closely the date
when my communication
must have reached him...
with all my material.
He evidently didn't think it
important enough to answer.
<i>Or too important.</i>
McKuen, go to the shipping offices.
No, go directly to the harbor!
Find out when
the next ship leaves for Iceland.
Oliver, Oliver.
I will not be beaten
to my goal.
<i>What is your goal?
Can you ask that?</i>
You heard
Saknussemm's message.
Oliver, you're seriously ill.
I am seriously well!
What are you waiting for?
I told you to hurry.
If you'll excuse me,
I must start packing
my things.
To go where?
To Iceland,
to begin with.
And then?
Where Arne Saknussemm went.
Oliver!
Will you kindly stop saying
Oliver?
You don't think I can sit
in my classroom
while a scoundrel named Goetaborg
exploits what I foolishly
placed in his hands.
Don't you see
what's at stake?
The ultimate aim
of all science-
to penetrate the unknown.
Do you know we know less
about the earth we live on
than about the stars
and galaxies of outer space?
The greatest mystery
is right here.
Right under our feet.
And now, if you'll
excuse me, gentlemen.
I must have a word with you.
I have no time for words.
You must take time
for this, sir.
What are you so urgent about?
This is the most urgent.
moment of my life.
For you,
but not for me.
I have to be in Iceland
before the week's over.
So must I.
I'm going with you, sir.
Where?
To the center of the Earth,
naturally.
Oh!
♪ My heart's
in the Highlands ♪
♪ A-chasing the deer ♪
♪ A-hunting the wild deer ♪
♪ And chasing the roe ♪
♪ My heart's
in the Highland ♪
♪ Wherever I go ♪♪
By now all Iceland
must be aware that
the Scots have arrived.
I wish I could sing loud enough
for Jenny to hear me.
Homesick already?
It's a bit painful to leave your fiancée
on the first day
of your engagement.
But to come back
as a world famous scientist,
that's not to be sneezed at.
Come here. Take a look.
Did you expect
a flight of stairs
with a red carpet?
I neglected to tell you, sir,
I have a nervous fear
of heights.
Well, you'll get over that
after the first
million fathoms or so.
Million fathoms.
Alec!
He's been here!
He's been surveying here.
This is fresh-cut wood.
Your revered colleague
from Stockholm.
He isn't wasting any time.
Do you think
he's already gone down?
No. Saknussemm stipulated
the last day of May.
Take a carriage
back to Reykjavik.
Buy every foot of rope
that's available.
Stock up on hardtack, salted beef,
chocolate and medical supplies.
But more than anything,
inquire whether they
have Ruhmkorf lamps.
Have another carriage
waiting for me at the foot
of the slope at sunset.
You think we can prepare it
all so quickly?
We must.
We're in a race.
What's that you're taking?
Jenny's farewell gift.
I'll keep it
with me always.
Scartaris!
<i>- Back to my hotel.
- Ja, Professor Goetaborg.</i>
Ah, there, my good man.
I assume my assistant
sent you.
No, thank you.
Nobody carries
the soldier's weapons.
And take your time.
These instruments
are delicate.
Easy, coachman! Easy!
This isn't the same road
we came by this morning!
I said, slow down, man!
You're out of your senses!
Stop your horses, man!
This is not a request,
it's a command!
Can't you hear me?
Slow down!
Stop, you fool!
Whoa!
If you've ruined my instruments,
I'll horsewhip you,
so help me.
And where are we?
This certainly
is not my hotel.
- Professor!
- Alec!
Where are we?
Apparently in
an eider feather storehouse.
How did you get here?
I don't know what happened.
It went so fast.
I was clubbed.
I was overpowered before I knew
there was a struggle.
Did you see who did it?
No. I was just walking
trying to get done with your errands.
When I said Professor Goetaborg
was a scoundrel, I flattered him.
He's a criminal!
Likely all his life long,
he's dreamed of such a project.
Your letter was the key
to the door of fame.
Hush. Did you hear that?
What?
Some tapping.
Don't get your hopes up, Professor.
There's not a soul around.
Everybody's in Iceland
is in the market square.
Why? It isn't Sunday!
Tomorrow the fishing fleet
goes out for the first haul.
You couldn't make our purchases.
The shops are closed.
No. The shops are open,
but every piece of rope,
every lamp,
everything we'd need
was sold in the last two days.
To Professor Goetaborg!
He's staying in the inn
where we have our rooms.
This time I heard it too.
A fellow prisoner,
do you suppose?
He's giving us signals.
It's a code.
Morse?
I can't just make it out.
Jot this down.
Dash, dash, dot,
dot, dot, dot, long dash.
It doesn't make sense.
Perhaps it's in Icelandic.
I don't think so.
We've established contact.
I still can't make it out.
My esteemed friend,
whoever you are,
let me introduce myself,
Professor
Oliver Lindenbrook,
University of Edinburgh.
May I ask you
to interrupt your tapping
and listen?
In what language
would you like me to speak?
Apparently,
he doesn't understand English.
I'll try French.
<i>Mon cher ami,</i>
<i>vous et nous
sonnes dans
une situation abominable!</i>
It's no good, sir.
It sounds more Russian.
Gertrude!
Gertrude!
Gertrude!
It's a female prisoner.
And her lover.
Professor, they're kissing.
I'm sorry, but for once
we must dispense
with tact.
Much as
I regret to disturb this tender moment,
can you get us out of here?
Oh, Gertrude.
It's a duck!
And I was just about
to try Latin.
Young man
with the gold tooth,
I'll give you more gold
if you'll guide us
to Reykjavik.
<i>Ah. Ja, Reykjavik.</i>
You take us to Reykjavik.
I understand
that Professor Goetaborg
from Stockholm is stopping here.
A friend-
A friend of yours?
Professor Goetaborg?
Let's say a colleague.
May I be of help?
- He is at home, isn't he?
- Yes. I-
Oh, he is not at home.
He is not to be disturbed.
Don't tell me he's asleep
with all this going on.
You cannot see him.
I'm sorry.
Here are your coins.
And here is my card.
If you'd be good enough to
put it in his box
so he'll know that I'm around.
Thank you so much.
Goetaborg,
I know you're in there!
Open up!
This is Lindenbrook.
Goetaborg.
Do you see
what this is, laddie?
The very last word
in equipment.
Ruhmkorf lamps!
Oh!
Self-generating.
How long will they burn,
Professor?
My guess is indefinitely.
As long as they're wound up,
the induction coil
will give off current.
Breathing devices,
the kind they use
in coal mines in Wales.
All the instruments needed
for exploring
the world below,
whatever it may be!
I shall wait here
till Goetaborg returns.
You...
wait too.
Goetaborg may be
a strong man.
More treasure, sir.
Climbing boots,
alpenstocks,
blankets.
Food for months.
A chart with-
P-P-Professor!
What?
Well, Goetaborg,
it seems there's such a thing
as justice, after all.
So you wanted to
push in ahead of us?
Fate took care of him.
Why didn't they
tell us at the desk?
Hotels rarely advertise
the fact that they have
corpses lying around.
The Icelander
teaches us a lesson.
All right. We'll observe
one minute of silence in memory
of a great scientist,
even if he was
a blasted thief.
Alec,
you mentioned fate.
Slight correction-
Fate plus a few grains
of potassium cyanide.
He was against us.
Someone was even more
against him.
Who?
I'm the wife of
Professor Goetaborg.
Oh, my dear.
What is it?
I was surprised my husband
wasn't at the pier to meet me.
Is something wrong?
Won't you sit down for a minute
before you go up?
Please, my dear.
He seemed so well.
Early in the morning,
he went to the mountain.
He came back for lunch
and received his guest in the lobby.
I saw him myself.
They went up to his room and ate.
What are you trying
to tell me?
That my husband is-
His guest left about 4:00.
In the evening,
when the maid went
to make the bed-
Oh, dear God.
As long as I can remember
no one ever died in my inn.
Of course, we called a doctor,
but it was too late.
We left him up there
because we knew you were due in
on the morning boat.
Just 10 days ago,
he was joking on the pier
in Stockholm.
The moment
he arrived here,
he sent me a message
just with one word-
"Come."
Madam,
my deep sympathy.
My name is
Oliver Lindenbrook
of Edinburgh University.
I take it you're familiar
with that name.
Professor Lindenbrook.
I see you are.
I must ask you a question.
It's just as well that
Madam Goetaborg
be present.
This will be difficult
for you, madam.
But it must be faced.
Who was the last person
to see Professor Goetaborg alive?
His luncheon guest.
Who was that?
- Count Saknussemm.
- Count Saknussemm?
I didn't realize
the Saknussemm family
still existed.
The Saknussemms
are the oldest family in this whole land.
A descendant of
Arne Saknussemm.
And a scientist, too,
in his own right.
It was he who lunched
with Professor Goetaborg?
They saw each other
every day.
They worked together
in his room
with all those charts
and instruments.
I suggest that you have
an autopsy performed immediately.
You think
there's something suspicious
about my husband's death?
Your husband came to Iceland
for the same reasons
that brought me.
Neither he nor I
could possibly suspect
there was a third party would
stop at nothing to forestall us.
He was killed?
Poisoned.
Oh.
This is now
a matter for the police.
Send for them at once.
To your room first,
madam.
Uh, just one second,
if you please.
Thank you.
I'm deeply distressed
by your husband's death.
I fully understand
your feelings.
However, I must ask you
one question.
How do you plan to dispose
of the equipment
your husband assembled up there?
What does it matter now?
Precisely. Don't give it
another thought.
I'll take it off your hands.
We can discuss it later.
We cannot discuss it later.
Time is running out.
My expedition must start
within 24 hours.
Your expedition?
Exactly.
I only know of
the Goetaborg Expedition.
Husbands don't always
tell their wives everything.
I don't wish to blacken
the memory your husband.
However, because I'm under pressure,
I must change my request to a demand.
I have a right to that equipment
and I claim it.
A right to take over the work
of another man's lifetime?
He died for that idea!
An idea he stole from me.
That is a lie.
Madam.
An unforgivable lie.
I would rather destroy
every pound of that equipment
than let you have it.
"Incredible encounter!
A Saknussemm
descendant turns up,
acts as if he were
King of Volcanoes,
tries to force me to surrender
his ancestor's secret.
Saknussemm called again.
New complication!
My real adversary arrives,
Lindenbrook,
undoubtedly to claim his rights.
Must fight him somehow."
Oh, uh, young man,
would you come here
a moment, please?
Who are those for?
Professor Lindenbrook.
Ah-ha.
<i>Ja, madam.</i>
Oh, at least
we have some rope.
That's a beginning.
Tell him to stop jabbering
and go shopping.
What about lamps?
Uh, lamps. Lamps.
What about, uh, picks?
Oh, and provisions, food.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Put me down.
Put me down, big ox!
Tell him to put me down!
Put me down!
Somebody please
explain this outrage.
Are we to be abducted
every day in Iceland?
<i>Ja, madam.</i>
She speaks Icelandic.
I do,
but I wish to apologize to you
in plain English.
I went through
my husband's diary.
Some of his remarks
led me to believe you.
I did you an injustice.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Don't give it another thought.
I shan't.
I'm Sir Oliver's assistant.
My name is Alec McKuen.
This whole expedition began
thanks to this lad.
Began and that's
all it has done.
Sir Oliver, this morning you asked me
for these. If you still want them,
they're yours.
Will you say that again?
I shall not stand in the way
of the Lindenbrook Expedition.
Madam.
My husband had these boots
made specially.
I hope they fit you.
Mine will be ready
without delay.
I told your man to order
some for me immediately.
Good, good.
What was that?
Why would you need
boots like this?
I can't very well go in these.
Go where, madam?
Don't say it.
Naturally,
I'm coming along.
That's why I'm giving you
all of this. That's a condition.
I thought you understood.
You didn't mention
any condition.
Then I do now.
- Whom did you intend to take
besides this young man?
- The big Icelander.
Then I'll be very useful.
He doesn't
understand English.
You can't come along!
You're a woman!
What has my sex to do with this?
<i>We're not contemplating
a stroll down Piccadilly
or the Champs-Elysées.</i>
Professor Lindenbrook,
I've just lost my husband.
I have nothing else to live for
up here.
Down there,
I can at least represent his name.
Unfortunately,
the decision is not yours to make.
The police require your presence
for the investigation
into your husband's death.
I have already given
my testimony.
But madam, quite apart
from the appalling danger,
think of the inconvenience.
The lack of privacy!
In short,
you don't want all of this.
Is that it?
I may be mad
on the subject of this journey,
but I am not stupid!
To burden myself with
a female is sheer stupidity.
I resent that word. I may have been
a disturbance to men,
never a burden.
This is
an absolute holdup.
I assure you
you will not receive
one iota of extra consideration.
You'll sleep where we sleep,
you'll eat what we eat
and wash when we wash.
Then you accept
my proposition?
Oh!
Professor, look!
There's our gateway.
Thank you, Scartaris.
Never was there
a brighter sunrise.
Now, we descend
into oblivion,
or we enter
the great book of history.
- Roll call.
- Carla Goetaborg.
<i>- Alexander McKuen.
- Hans und Gertrude Belka.</i>
Oliver S. Lindenbrook.
What did he say?
Hans and who?
And Gertrude.
Professor!
Professor!
All right,
you've arrived.
Rather an alarming
descent.
I found it exhilarating.
I wonder
if Madam Goetaborg will
change her mind as the last moment.
You make
my mouth water.
Hans is tying the rope
on her.
I'm a fool. I should have told him
to tie her to one of the mules
and send her back where she belongs.
In what language
would you have told him that,
Sir Oliver?
She may be of some use
in that respect.
Then there's always the blessed
chance the rope may break.
Are you all right,
ma'am?
Oh, quite.
Hans insisted
on a double rope.
Did he indeed?
How solicitous.
But that was for Gertrude.
Poor Sir Oliver,
stuck with a woman.
If only you
could see your face.
That's my consolation,
madam.
I don't have to look at it.
You do.
There isn't enough rope
in all Europe!
Perhaps we made a mistake
and this is the wrong entrance.
The sign was
unmistakable.
But there's no
other way to continue.
Gertrude!
Gertrude!
Oh, madam!
Madam!
He says there's a tunnel
on the other side.
Slanting downhill,
but walkable.
Eureka!
Oh, thank you.
Now then,
a general summary.
A- We must never use
more than two Ruhmkorf lamps
at a time.
B- We'll not be needing
our breathing equipment
for a long stretch.
Nevertheless, never
take a step without it.
C- Use our canteens freely
for the present.
There'll be plenty of
springs on our way.
As my husband's charts
indicated.
Is Professor Goetaborg
to be with us
on our entire journey?
Sorry.
Well, every journey
begins with a first step.
May the good Lord
be with us. Onward!
And let's have some music.
Alec, will you start us off?
♪ La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la ♪
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪
♪ Boom-boom
boom-boom ♪♪
Miss Jenny!
I saw you turn pale
when the dominie spoke
of those in peril
at the far ends
of the earth.
Far ends of the earth,
at least that
would be somewhere.
There was a clipping
in a Stockholm paper,
a dispatch
from Reykjavik.
I can only read
their names.
I had it translated.
The last news of them
was that they went up
Mount Sneffels
with some heavily-laden
donkeys.
Yes?
And then the animals
came down without their packs.
And?
And that's all.
Oliver S. Lindenbrook,
Alexander McKuen,
Hans Belka,
and Madam-
What's-
Why, it seems a woman
went with them.
A woman!
You know what
they'll call that
in the Royal Observatory
at Greenwich?
"A slight tremor coming
from undefined regions."
Well, we've lived
through a slight tremor.
Let us proceed.
It seems to be
moving away from us.
Madam, in these regions,
I'd never venture to say
anything is moving away
or coming towards us.
The only thing we can
be certain of is that
danger is always with us.
We might as well
ignore it.
Run!
Jump!
Aah! Oh!
The three notches.
The three notches
of Arne Saknussemm.
What does that mean?
We've been shown
the right path.
We have a guide.
Alec,
the plumb bob.
Look! Without these marks,
we would have gone astray.
We'd have wasted months
exploring endlessly.
We might have taken
any one of these channels.
But our great colleague
maketh a path for our feet.
Well, you all
deserve a rest.
Let's have tea with
a double ration of raisins.
May I comb my hair first,
Professor?
Oh!
Ladies on the left.
Gentleman on the right.
Oh!
What is it,
madam?
Shh!
If we'd known
you were subject to nightmares,
we'd have made different
sleeping arrangements.
Someone is walking
up there.
I heard footsteps, human footsteps.
Madam, since the beginning
of time,
all women have heard footsteps...
up there.
My hearing is
extremely acute.
The hearing of all women
is extremely acute.
My wife used to hear
rats in the attic,
usually, on the nights before
I had an important lecture.
I used to go up,
armed with a broom.
Alec, go up and find out.
Hans-
Madam, will you leave
those men alone?
They need rest.
<i>Moreover, it was stipulated
that I give the orders.</i>
There's no need to use
that patient voice with me,
Professor.
Would you rather I used
an impatient voice?
Professor Lindenbrook,
I am a member
of this expedition.
As such, I intend to report
any observations I make.
Alec, put it down
in the record
that a member of the expedition
reported rats in the attic.
Lights out!
Don't be afraid, madam.
I'm right here.
Conceal these marks completely.
I'll give them
some new ones.
This is steeper than
anything we've encountered.
It's just as well we all
had a good night's rest.
Alec, take this down.
21st day of our descent,
starting from an estimated depth
of 129 kilometers,
limestone formation
continues.
Aye, aye,
Professor!
Here are the three
notches again.
Good!
Gertrude!
Wrong turn.
Let's see.
What have we here?
One heads 220 degrees
south-southwest,
the other 160 degrees
south-southeast. Strange.
I would have wagered
we'd have to bear in that direction.
That was Gertrude's
feeling too.
Are you sure
your compass is right?
Quite.
Madam-
What's he saying?
Hans is wondering about
the ultimate goal of our expedition.
He's asking, "Why?"
Alec, suppose
you tell him.
Well, why does man
freeze to death
trying to reach the North Pole?
Why does man
suffer the steam and heat
of the Amazon?
Why does he stagger his mind
with the mathematics of the sky?
Once a question mark
has arisen
in the human brain,
the answer must be found
if it takes a hundred years,
a thousand years.
Let's hear you render that
into a few well-chosen
Icelandic words.
Why not simply tell him
scientists have bats
in their belfries?
Oh!
Are you all right?
Can you unhook yourself?
Yes! Hans!
Grab his hand.
I didn't see it! I didn't see it!
Never mind about that.
How is it possible?
This way was
clearly indicated.
There must have been a quake
since Arne Saknussemm's day.
This is no recent fissure.
This has been here since the beginning of time.
I was not in a position
to observe it scientifically.
We made a mistake somewhere,
but where?
What are you doing here, madam?
We're supposed to stay together.
You know we must never have
more than two lamps at a time.
We've been tricked,
tricked into
the wrong tunnel.
Those three notches
are not Arne Saknussemm's.
She's right, Professor.
Someone has passed through
before us.
No need to ask who.
Madam heard him
last night.
Now she's saying,
"I told you so."
Silently, I admit,
but she's saying it.
When I wish
to say something,
I say it aloud.
In view of
this new development,
I have no choice but
to break up the expedition.
- We must return.
- Why?
You don't strike me as
a man who frightens easily.
I'm not thinking
of myself.
You know that.
I must think of you-
a woman!
We agreed I was to be
one of your men.
But if there is a madman
is loose in these-
He's against all of us,
against the very concept
of this journey.
What's happened now?
What's he saying?
He said we should go back
to where Alec fell.
But it's not
on our route.
If we're to go ahead,
we've no time
for detours.
Then you wait here.
If only my Jenny
were here to see this.
♪ La, la, la ♪
♪ La-la, la-la-la ♪
♪ La, la, la ♪
♪ Bum dee bum bum ♪
♪ Bum dee dum ♪♪
Madam, now that
the boy has gone
and Hans doesn't
understand English,
I must ask
a delicate question.
I'm blushing already.
You're wearing stays,
are you not?
Professor!
Yes, I thought so.
I can hear them
creaking as you walk.
What I wear is not
your business!
Everything here
is my business.
Hans and I will look the other way
while you discard them.
Professor,
you go too far.
We're approaching regions
where the heat
will be excessive.
Nothing must impede
anyone's breathing.
Alec!
Leaving in a few minutes!
I've got to take a specimen
of this back to Edinburgh,
if it's the last thing I do.
Unique.
Inexplicable.
Ready to go, if that boy
Alec would be good enough
to appear.
Where the devil
is he?
It's a blind alley!
Keep back!
Professor!
Hans!
Good God!
Hold on.
Hold on to my arm.
My shoulder.
Hold on to me.
Oh, praise the Lord.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh.
Alec.
Professor!
Hello! Hello!
Professor,
here I am!
Here I am!
Salt!
Alec!
Alec!
Professor, you can't
go on this way.
I've kept track
of the passage of days.
You haven't.
We'll try that channel
over there.
We were in that channel
yesterday.
We left marks.
You won't find him there.
I've got to find him.
I'm responsible.
Oh.
No need to translate.
I can see this
is a recent break.
Alec!
Can you hear me?
If you're down there,
give us a sign!
Alec, listen carefully.
When the echoes stop,
you must try to answer.
If you're injured,
if you can't talk,
make an effort.
Pick up a pebble
and scratch the rock.
We'll hear you.
I promise you.
Just give us a sign!
A phosphorescent pool.
Strange grave
for a young Scot.
Professor,
there's no use.
How can I live
with myself?
Accept his loss
like one soldier accepts
the loss of another soldier.
You must continue what you started.
You must go on with
the Lindenbrook Expedition.
The Lindenbrook
Expedition.
Yes.
Go on with it.
It was his project,
as much as it was yours.
Yes, you're right.
We will proceed,
but we won't call it
the Lindenbrook
Expedition anymore.
From now on,
it's the Alec McKuen
Expedition.
No broken bones?
Ribs all right?
Good. Get up.
Down there,
food and water.
Refresh yourself.
So you lost
your friends?
Just as well.
It's my servant.
Too much heat,
too much load,
too much fear.
You're younger.
You'll do to carry my things.
I'm not your servant,
Count Saknussemm.
Pride?
Rather out of place here.
Eat, drink
and pick up those things.
I'm in a hurry.
To steal
the professor's project?
Steal?
Listen, young foreigner.
I don't have to steal
what belongs to me.
You're in my world now.
Stop!
I need someone to
carry my equipment!
You'll never find
your companions
or your way out.
You need me
as much as I need you.
You found me.
My friends could find me too.
Very well,
you'll carry it with one arm,
not two!
A hail of bullets.
No, no! It's a multiple echo
reverberating through
the rock chambers.
The last echo
will give us the direction.
166 degrees south-southeast.
Alec. Alec.
Alec. Alec!
We'd given you up,
but you're alive, laddie.
You're alive!
Professor.
Carla. Hans.
Just to see y-
Where was he?
I-I didn't think he'd shoot,
but he did.
Of course I did.
What did you expect?
You are trespassers here.
I am the owner
of this domain.
You are also
the murderer of my husband.
I claimed my rights.
He would not listen.
Count Saknussemm,
in the name of your great ancestor,
put down that preposterous gun.
No harm will come
if you accept my terms.
You will go back
the way you came,
but you will
leave equipment I need
and that man.
Sir Oliver,
you are not going to listen
to a murderer.
Never interrupt
a murderer, madam.
I resent that
bourgeois classification.
I'll spare your lives.
You have
my word of honor.
Give me
your hand on that.
A bourgeois trick.
So sorry.
All right, before
we continue on our journey,
we must perform
a solemn duty.
We have
to hold court.
Here, hundreds of kilometers
beneath the surface
of the earth,
we are the law.
The defendant stands accused
of one murder
and one act of mayhem.
To preserve legal formalities,
I must ask you, as jurors,
is the defendant
guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Guilty.
Hans.
Guilty.
Then the mandatory
sentence...
is death.
There are two bullets left.
Madam,
will you be good enough
to explain to Hans?
We will follow the route
marked by the notches.
He is to wait here
for 10 minutes,
then carry out the sentence.
No, no, no, no, no.
Professor, I can carry
something with my left hand.
You can carry yourself
for a couple of days.
That's all we can expect.
Sir Oliver,
there's a slight problem.
Our friend
Hans refuses to shoot the count.
What do you mean, refuses?
It's a court order.
It seems his family have been loyal
to the Saknussemms
for generations.
And, well, he cannot touch the gun.
This is contempt of court.
All right, Alec.
Oh, no, no, Profess-
I mean, Sir Oliver.
You mustn't look at me.
I, um-
I couldn't pull the trigger
with my left hand.
Oh, no. You-
You couldn't consider
for a moment that I could do it.
After all, I'm a woman!
I see. For weeks
you've been denying your sex.
And now you fall back on it.
I would say
the natural executioner
would be the leader
of the expedition.
We must face
the truth, sir.
We're much too civilized
to-to do away with
a fellow human being.
What do you propose?
Drag him along with us?
Feed him?
Let him share our glory?
Stop fiddling
with those lamps!
Oh, Madam-
What's he jabbering about?
I'll tell you
what he's saying.
The lamps are giving out.
And I'll give you the reason.
The induction coils
have been corroded by the salt.
To save what we can,
I insist that we leave
these regions at once.
<i>You insist?</i>
As a matter of fact,
he's bloody well right.
Let's be off.
You realize, Professor,
Saknussemm's unfastened
himself from the rope again
and gone off?
Oh, what's the harm?
He'll be back when it's time to eat.
The harm is, Madam,
he's wasting a lamp.
Madam, will you
try your lamp, please?
It's dead.
Yours, Alec?
When these things
are gone,
they're really gone.
Madam, make a final note
while there is still light enough
to write by.
Let me.
My arm's well now.
No need.
Covered another
92 kilometers.
Temperature
dropped seven degrees.
Surprisingly cooler
than anticipated.
The darkness is
closing about us.
This may be
our last entry.
Hans and I can cut some rope
into torches.
That's a good idea.
What puzzles me is that
the three notches
of Arne Saknussemm...
still keep pointing
our way.
What kind of a lamp
did he have?
Perhaps my ancestor
did not require a lamp.
From here on,
neither do you, Sir Oliver.
Why don't you turn it off?
Yes,
just switch it off.
Why,
it's miraculous.
Look at this.
What is it, sir?
A form of algae with
a property of luminescence.
Light without heat.
A cool chemical light.
You've seen fireflies, Madam,
and glowworms
and forms of life in the sea
that generate
their own light?
The same principle
is involved here.
256th day.
The phenomenal winds
vanished as abruptly
as they came.
We are now in a stupendous
deposit of cinnabar.
What's that curious
little mark you make
on every page?
M.E.-
McKuen Expedition.
You mean that
whenever I've said
Lindenbrook Expedition,
you've written
McKuen Expedition?
May I remind you
that months ago,
you gave me explicit orders
to that effect?
You may not remind me.
I do not wish to be corrected
by you incessantly.
Is that what I'm doing?
You're doing it
with your looks,
with the inflection of your voice,
the very posture
of your body.
Your entire presence is
a constant criticism of me.
I'm tired of it.
I've had enough!
<i>You've had enough!</i>
Let me tell you,
you dried-up walnut
of a man!
If anyone's had enough,
it's me!
<i>It's I.</i>
It's I! It's me!
It's Carla Goetaborg.
I quit!
I'm leaving!
May I send for
madam's horse and carriage?
Well, at least you know
I have a temper.
Alec will
keep the charts. Alec!
Alec!
Why can't
he stay around?
Aye, aye, aye, aye-o!
Mushrooms!
A forest of mushrooms.
They might be hundreds
of years old, but
the small ones we can eat.
They're delicious!
To think they grew
without sun
this far under the earth!
All the food
we can eat!
It's tougher
than leather.
We'll have new soles
for our shoes.
Ooh!
It's like an oak tree!
Ah! Madam,
you're magnificent.
Mushroom steak,
mushroom soup, mushroom hash.
Let me say this-
If we'd had one more week
of that salted beef,
I would have perished.
Don't be too happy.
After some months of this,
you'll be smacking your lips
at the thought of salt beef.
Yes. Months, months.
If we only knew
how many more.
There's no term
to the work of a scientist.
Let me say this, Madam,
if you hadn't been along,
this whole journey
would have been unbearable.
But that's not Professor
Lindenbrook's feeling.
It's mine.
You see, we have no sun,
no moon, no stars,
but then you're here.
And what is the name
of the girl you love?
I beg your pardon?
The girl you love.
What's her name?
Jenny. But why would you
want to know that just now?
Oh, dear Alec.
There are times
when it's advisable
to jog a young man's memory.
Professor!
Here's some hot mushroom porridge
for you, Sir Oliver.
I slept as I'd never slept
in Edinburgh.
No street noises,
no church bells,
no clatter of pans
from the kitchen.
I may move here
permanently.
What's our large friend
doing over there?
I don't know.
Special command of His Majesty.
Is that madman
still giving orders?
This is supposed to be
his rest period.
The minute you fell asleep,
he went off in that direction,
through the tunnel.
He came back long enough to order
the felling of the mushrooms.
What in the world can he want
with all those?
You've come to ask me
why I didn't take my rest period.
I don't sleep.
I hate those little
slashes of death.
It's a sea.
It's an ocean
with waves and currents.
The ocean
of the underworld.
Some earthquake before
the beginning of history
cracked wide open
the great sea,
and, through the fissures,
poured this.
The fissures
closed again.
No map ever recorded
the Saknussemm Ocean.
I so christened it
while you were asleep.
It's the prerogative
of the discoverer.
I congratulate you.
You realize, Lindenbrook,
from now on there will be no more
notches to follow.
That's why you ordered a raft.
I approve.
A Dimetrodon!
If I had my gun,
we'd have fresh meat for dinner.
That's what he's saying!
He's a flesh-eater!
Can he swim?
No, thank God.
The wind blows
down the high street.
Here.
I brought you
some nice apples.
I wonder if it's cold
where they are.
Where they are,
indeed!
Are they anyplace?
McKuen, put that toy away
and take over the rudder.
Yes, sir.
I didn't tell you to
throw it away!
It blew out of my hand!
My watch!
The instruments!
Save the instruments!
My ring!
My wedding ring!
A field of force
that snatches gold away.
This is it. This is it!
The junction
of magnetic forces
from the North to the South Pole!
The center of the Earth!
Hang on!
Hold on to your rope,
Alec! Hold on!
No!
Is everyone here?
Madam Goetaborg,
Alec,
Hans.
Gertrude.
And His Highness
over there.
So...
the expedition
with all the names
ends like this.
We're alive, aren't we?
After all, we did hit
the center of the Earth.
It hit us, laddie.
No need to tell us.
He wants to know
where we go from here.
Tired minds
don't plan well.
Sleep first, plan later.
When I refused
to eat my porridge
when I was a boy,
my mother,
like all mothers, used to say,
"Oliver, the day may come
when you'd very much
like to have that porridge."
Why do you look so surprised?
Is it incredible that I ever had a mother?
I was just thinking
how proud she'd be
of that little boy
who wouldn't eat his porridge.
Here, duck.
Here, duck.
Gertrude.
Gertrude.
Gertrude?
Gertrude!
Gertrude!
Gertrude! Gertrude!
Gertrude!
Hans! Hans!
Why do you look at me
like that?
Hans!
I needed food,
so I took it.
Professor, tell your man
to calm himself.
I'm not in the mood
to engage in a dispute
about a slaughtered duck.
Professor!
Stop him!
Stop this fool!
- Hans!
- Hans!
You ingrates!
What can you do without me?
Only I can show you the way
out of this realm of mine.
Look out!
This is
the sunken city.
After 5,000 years,
men behold a fragment
of the lost Atlantis.
All we know about it
comes from the Greek.
The floor of the sea opened up
and swallowed
the whole island of Atlantis.
This must have been
the market square.
Professor!
Professor, this looks like
some sort of inn.
It is an inn,
an eating place, certainly.
Eating. What a word.
What a wonderful word.
Well, we've learned one thing
about the inhabitants of Atlantis.
They ate oysters.
Stale bread.
We must speak
to the baker.
Madam!
Madam!
<i>Ja?</i>
He's asking if that was
a temple to their god?
Yes, I'm sure it is.
It's some sort of altar stone
where the sacred flame burned.
It's serpentine,
isn't it?
Exactly.
A massive form of asbestos.
To think that
at a moment like this,
I've no pad and pencil
to record it all.
Turn around, madam.
Don't look.
What is it?
The great Arne Saknussemm,
I presume.
So this is
as far as he came.
What's the matter with you two?
Say "How do you do"
to a brave man.
He must have
dragged himself here
with a broken leg.
Look at that tibia.
You won't find anything edible
in there.
Why not?
The Chinese eat eggs
over 400 years old.
Gunpowder.
Professor, look at his right hand.
It's pointing somewhere.
To that shaft
over there.
Of course! Of course!
This is what
the pointing finger meant!
This is the way up.
He couldn't make it,
but we can.
This is a volcanic chimney.
The violent updraft can mean
only one thing.
A direct hatchway
to the surface.
We can climb up!
Madam, explain to Hans.
Let him venture
a hundred meters or so
and reconnoiter.
<i>The updraft
can't carry him away.</i>
Hans-
Now I'd say let's
roll up our sleeves,
if we had any.
We mustn't hope
for too much.
This light won't be with us
all the way.
We'll have to provide
some kind of light.
And food.
I'll go see what I can find.
I'll comb every inch of Atlantis.
If we only had
some shears,
we could cut it off.
Could we?
Aye, aye! Aye, aye!
Aye, aye!
Aye, aye!
Flints!
I found some flints.
Good lad.
We won't be walking
in darkness.
Madam!
I wish I had
better news for you.
It gives every indication
of being a perfect passage upward,
straighter than the one
we descended, but-
But? But?
There's an obstacle,
a gigantic block of stone
obstructs the passageway.
Hans said only a landslide
could ever move it.
No. Let him be.
If all his hopes
hadn't been so high.
- Alec!
- Yes, sir?
The haversack.
Arne Saknussemm's
haversack. Get it!
If God is with us,
and that gunpowder
has kept its ginger over the years,
we'll make that
landslide ourselves.
Now, my wonderful
companions,
you realize, I hope,
that we're taking
an enormous chance.
But it's our only chance.
I guarantee that this will
blow up the obstructing rock.
Whether the surrounding rocks
will take the disturbance lightly,
that I cannot guarantee.
Let's get what protection we can.
Into the altar stone.
Dear God,
ruler of heaven and the Earth-
Don't set any limit
to his realm, laddie.
God of the universe,
we are in thy merciful hands.
Look out!
Run, Professor!
A monster!
Let me go!
We started an earthquake.
The lava
is pushing us up!
It's an earthquake
of unusual magnitude!
More likely,
it's a volcanic eruption.
Listen to this-
"Stromboli, Italy,
first eyewitness report.
The capsule
of the dead volcano
broke under
a tremendous explosion.
Rocks of extraordinary size
are being spewed out into the sea."
<i>Dammi una mano.</i>
<i>Piano, eh? Piano.</i>
<i>Passami vino.</i>
<i>Ecco.</i>
<i>Signora, beva, beva.</i>
Where's Alec?
Hans says Alec was thrown
from the altar stone
long before
we hit the water.
<i>Non sipreoccupi,
abbiamo lo scalino!</i>
I'm most grateful, ladies.
But my immediate need
is not a ladder.
I need trousers!
<i>Che dice?
Pants!</i>
Pantaloons!
Pantaloons!
<i>Oh, vuole pantalone!</i>
<i>Pantalone? Oh!</i>
Don't bring them
yourselves.
Send a friar, a monk.
- Oh!
- Oh!
Oh!
Excuse me, ladies.
Excuse me.
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook!
Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech!
Hello, Scots!
If these shouts of yours
express some pleasure
that we've returned alive,
I thank you deeply.
However,
if they're meant as praise
for a successful scientist,
I must disclaim that honor.
- No!
- No!
No. A scientist who cannot prove
what he has accomplished
has accomplished nothing.
I have no records,
no shred of evidence.
I will never embarrass
this distinguished university
by asking
that it take my word.
Let me say only this.
300 years ago,
a daring man undertook
a perilous journey
and never came back.
We followed his path
and returned...
by the grace of God
and a heathen altar stone.
One day, someone else,
it may be you, my boy,
or your sons or grandsons
will pick up
where we left off.
This I know.
The spirit of man
cannot be stopped!
- Splendid, Oliver.
- Thank you.
Professor, here's someone
who wants to say good-bye.
His ship sails at 4:00.
Hans, old friend,
we never could have
done without you.
He has a speech.
Uh-
Hello, sir. If you-
If you'll ever go
down there again,
the center Earth,
Hans will go too.
Thank you.
Did you get your injuries
when the volcano blew up,
in the hot lava?
Oh, no.
It happened in Edinburgh,
at our wedding.
He was in such a hurry
leaving the church
he fell down the steps.
You poor wee bride,
after all that waiting,
it's been no marriage
for you at all.
You underestimate Alec.
I'm taking the night train
to London and
then back to Stockholm.
Stockholm?
But you have a job
to do right here.
I?
I intend to write my memoirs,
You don't think I can remember
everything that happened alone.
Oh, I see.
What you need is a widow
who can jog your memory
and take dictation.
I suppose I'm to report
every day from 9:00 till 12:00?
From 2:00 to 6:00?
No. None of that nonsense.
You can stay in my house.
And what would
Edinburgh say?
It's one thing
to spend one's days and nights
with a man under the earth,
another under one roof
in Scotland.
Well, uh,
what do you propose?
Oh, that's not a word
I bandy about, Professor.
What did I say?
Which word?
I thought it would
catch in your throat.
Uh, madam!
Madam.
Oh, thank you.
Uh, Madam Goetaborg!
Frau Goetaborg. Carla!
Yes, Oliver?
Carla.
I warn you.
I'm wearing stays again.
