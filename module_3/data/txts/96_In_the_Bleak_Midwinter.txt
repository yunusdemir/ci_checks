  ¶ THE WORLD FOR SOME YEARS HAS
  BEEN SODDEN WITH TEARS ¶
        ¶ ON BEHALF OF
    THE ACTING PROFESSION ¶
        ¶ EACH STAR
        PLAYING A PART ¶
        ¶ SEEMS TO EXPECT
        A PURPLE HEART ¶
    ¶ IT'S UNORTHODOX
    TO BE BORN IN A BOX ¶
    ¶ BUT IT NEEDN'T BECOME
        AN OBSESSION ¶
    ¶ LET'S HOPE WE HAVE
    NO WORSE TO PLAGUE US ¶
    ¶ THAN 2 SHOWS A NIGHT
        IN LAS VEGAS ¶
¶ WHEN I THINK OF PHYSICIANS
    AND MATHEMATICIANS ¶
    ¶ WHO DON'T EARN
    A QUARTER THE DOUGH ¶
    ¶ WHEN I LOOK AT THE FACES
    OF PEOPLE IN MACY'S ¶
    ¶ THERE'S ONE THING
    I'M BURNING TO KNOW ¶
    IT WAS LATE NOVEMBER,
        UH, I THINK.
    AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT
    THE WHOLE CHRISTMAS THING.
    THE BIRTH OF CHRIST,
    <i> THE WIZARD OF OZ,</i>
        FAMILY MURDERS,
        AND, QUITE FRANKLY,
        I WAS DEPRESSED.
    I MEAN, I'D ALWAYS WANTED
        TO LIVE MY LIFE
    LIKE IN AN OLD MOVIE,
    A SORT OF FAIRY TALE.
    MIND YOU, I SUPPOSE
        IF YOU THINK
    THAT A LOT OF FAIRY TALES
    TURN OUT TO BE NIGHTMARES
    AND A LOT OF OLD MOVIES
        ARE CRAP,
    THEN THAT'S WHAT I DID.
    SEE, UH, THE THING WAS
        THAT, UM...
        WELL, YOU KNOW
    THE WAY DOCTORS SAY
    THAT NERVOUS BREAKDOWNS
    CAN HAPPEN VERY FAST
        AND DRAMATICALLY,
        SORT OF BIG BANG?
    OR THERE ARE THE OTHER KIND,
    WHICH HAPPEN VERY SLOWLY
    OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.
    WELL, I WAS 33 YEARS OLD,
    AND THIS ONE HAD STARTED
    WHEN I WAS 7 MONTHS,
    AND IT HAD JUST BEGUN
    TO--TO GET A GRIP.
    ¶ WHY MUST THE SHOW GO ON? ¶
        ¶ IT CAN'T BE
    ALL THAT INDISPENSABLE ¶
    ¶ TO ME IT REALLY IS
    INSENSIBLE ON THE WHOLE ¶
    ¶ TO PLAY A LEADING ROLE ¶
    ¶ WHEN FIGHTING THOSE TEARS
        YOU CAN'T CONTROL ¶
    ¶ WHY KICK UP YOUR LEGS
    WHEN DROWNING THE DREGS ¶
    ¶ OF SORROW'S BITTER CUP? ¶
    ¶ BECAUSE YOU WERE BRED,
    SOME IDIOT HAS SAID ¶
    ¶ THE CURTAIN MUST STAY UP ¶
    ¶ I'D LIKE TO KNOW
    WHY A STAR TAKES BOWS ¶
    ¶ HAVING JUST RETURNED
    FROM BURYING HER SPOUSE ¶
    ¶ BRAVE POOP-A-DOOPERS ¶
¶ GO HOME AND DRY YOUR TEARS ¶
    ¶ GALLANT ALL TROUPERS ¶
    ¶ YOU'VE BORED US ALL
        FOR YEARS ¶
    ¶ AND IF YOU'RE SO BLUE,
        WET THROUGH ¶
    ¶ AND THOROUGHLY WOEBEGONE ¶
    ¶ WHY MUST THE SHOW GO ON? ¶
        ¶ OH, MAMMY ¶
    ¶ WHY MUST THE SHOW GO ON? ¶
        DARLING, YOU'RE
        DEPRESSED, THAT'S ALL.
        EVERYONE GETS DEPRESSED.
        WITH MOST PEOPLE,
        THERE IS NO HAPPY,
        THERE'S NO SAD,
        JUST VARIOUS STAGES OF
        DEPRESSED. THAT'S LIFE.
WELL, NOT FOR ME,
NOT ANYMORE.
LOOK, PLEASE, HELP ME
WITH THIS IDEA!
    DARLING, YOU TRIED IT
    BEFORE. IT WAS A DISASTER.
MARGIE, I'VE BEEN
ACTING NOW FOR 11 YEARS.
IF EVERYTHING HAD GONE ACCORDING
TO LAURENCE OLIVIER'S BOOK,
I'D HAVE KNOWN TRIUMPH,
DISAPPOINTMENT,
AND MARRIED A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN!
INSTEAD, I'VE KNOWN TEDIUM,
HUMILIATION, AND GOT SHACKED UP
WITH A PSYCHO FROM HELL!
LIFE HAS TO CHANGE!
        BUT NOT BY COMMITTING
        PROFESSIONAL SUICIDE!
I HAVE TO DO THIS PLAY!
I'VE GIVEN MY LIFE A DEADLINE!
    LOOK, IT'S CHRISTMAS NOW.
    WAIT UNTIL THE NEW YEAR.
        GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT.
I'VE GIVEN IT THOUGHT--
365 DAYS' WORTH.
            ALL RIGHT.
            YOU'LL GET THE £600
            AND MY OFFICE
            AND A PHONE
            FOR ONE WEEK.
            NOW, I WANNA BE IN
            ON THE CASTING,
            AND I CAN PUT AN AD
            IN<i> THEATER WEEKLY.</i>
        YOU'D BETTER BE CAREFUL,
        BECAUSE WE DON'T
        WANT LAWSUITS.
        BUT I'M WARNING YOU,
        AT THIS TIME OF YEAR,
    EVERYONE IS DOING CHRISTMAS
    SHOWS OR TV SPECIALS,
        SO ALL YOU'RE
        GONNA GET IS ECCENTRICS,
        MISFITS, AND NUTTERS.
MARGIE, I LOVE YOU.
            OH, SHUSH,
            YOU SILLY LITTLE
            SUICIDAL
            MEGALOMANIAC YOU!
MARGIE, MARGIE...
WHAT ABOUT THAT FILM?
                    WHAT FILM?
THAT STUPID
SCIENCE FICTION FILM.
    OH, YES. YOU SAID YOU
    WEREN'T INTERESTED IN THAT.
NOW I'M JUST CURIOUS.
        YEAH, WELL, IT WAS DOWN
        TO YOU AND DYLAN JUDD.
DYLAN JUDD?
I DON'T--I DON'T
BELIEVE IT.
I--I DON'T--
    I--
I'M--I'M SPEECHLESS--
            I'M SO GLAD.
            I'M SO GLAD THAT
            YOU'VE REGAINED
        YOUR ARTISTIC SOUL,
        DARLING. I REALLY AM.
    YOU MUSTN'T LET THESE
    LITTLE THINGS BOTHER YOU.
DYLAN JUDD?
DYLAN JUDD? BUT I'M--
HE'S--HE'S--HE'S SHORT!
    (BICYCLE BELL RINGING)
            THERE! THERE, THERE,
            THERE, THERE!
AH. "AUDITIONS."
HMM. NICE AND BIG.
THAT'S GOOD.
"LIMITED ENGAGEMENT.
DECEMBER 11 TO DECEMBER 31.
<i> HAMLET."</i> THAT'S CLEAR,
SIMPLE. SO FAR, SO GOOD.
"A COOPERATIVE EXPERIENCE."
DO YOU HAVE TO USE
THESE PHRASES, DARLING?
IT'S NOT 1969.
        NO, PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW
        IT'S AN ENSEMBLE.
AND THAT YOU'RE
THE BIGGEST ENSEMBLER.
                GET ON WITH IT,
                PLEASE, PLEASE.
"PROFIT SHARE. SPIRIT SHARE."
UNBELIEVABLE.
        IT'S NOT ABOUT MONEY.
OR GRAMMAR. "ACCOMMODATION
AND INSPIRATION."
CAN'T YOU JUST SAY THAT
THEIR DIGS ARE INCLUDED?
        THEY NEED TO RECOGNIZE
        THE COMMITMENT!
WHAT'S THIS? OH, GOD.
"6 FELLOW JOURNEYMEN
TO ENTER THE GLOOMY DANE."
        OH, NO, THAT'S
        A MISTAKE. NO, NO.
    IT SHOULD BE TO ENTER THE
    WORLD OF THE GLOOMY DANE.
IT HARDLY MATTERS,
DARLING.
IT FINISHES WITH
"APPLY TO THE DIRECTOR
AND SWEAT PRINCE."
            SWEET! SWEET!
            SWEET PRINCE.
GREAT, DARLING.
EXPECT A LOT OF NEW-AGE GAYS
LOOKING FOR A WORKOUT.
        IT'S TERRIFIC
        THAT YOU COULD COME IN.
        THANKS VERY MUCH,
        INDEED.
        NOW, THIS IS REALLY
        A COLLABORATIVE PIECE,
        BUT IF YOU'D LIKE
        TO DO SOMETHING,
        IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
        SHAKESPEARE.
    THIS PRODUCTION WANTS TO BE
    EXTREMELY INNOVATIVE
    IN THE WAY WE COMMUNICATE.
            AH! AH!
            AH...
THANKS. I THOUGHT
IT WOULD PROBABLY WORK.
    (WEIRD VOICE) NOW IS
    THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT
    MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER
    BY THIS SUN OF YORK.
        I DON'T FEEL THAT YOU'VE
        MADE IT QUITE YOUR OWN,
            SO, LISTEN,
            LET'S JUST...
            DROP THE VOICE--
            SILLY IDEA--
            DROP THE HUNCH
            AND THE GESTURES...
    FINE.
            AND THEN...LET'S SEE
            WHAT HAPPENS.
            WHENEVER YOU WANT.
            IN YOUR OWN TIME.
(WEIRD VOICE) NOW IS THE WINTER
OF OUR DISCONTENT
MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER
BY THIS SUN OF YORK!
                ABSOLUTE
                TRANSFORMATION.
OH, IT FELT GREAT!
            THANK YOU!
            THANK YOU SO MUCH!
I REALLY FREED UP.
            OH, YOU DID.
            YOU FREED RIGHT UP.
    HENRY WAKEFIELD
    IS THE NAME, LOVE,
    KNOWN AS HARRY TO THOSE
    WHO WISH TO ANNOY ME.
            WHATEVER YOU PREFER
            TO BE.
    LOOK, LOVE,
    I WON'T MESS ABOUT.
    I HATE THESE PROFIT-SHARE
    THINGS. I WANT TO PLAY
    THE KING, RIGHT? I SHOULD
    HAVE PLAYED IT YEARS AGO,
    BUT YOU PAYS YOUR MONEY
    AND PUTS UP WITH YOUR
    MISERABLE BLOODY CHOICES.
        YES, WELL, IT'S--IT'S
        A WONDERFUL ROLE--
LESS OF THE DIRECTOR
BULLSHIT, LOVE.
JUST SAY YES. LET'S FACE IT.
YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE ME.
FROM YOUR AD, THIS PRODUCTION'S
ALREADY ABOUT AS PROMISING
AS PLAYING ROOKERY NOOK
ON<i> THE TITANIC,</i>
SO DON'T WASTE MY TIME,
SONNY, EH?
SEE YA AT THE READ-THROUGH.
    ALAS, POOR YORICK,
    I KNEW HIM WELL.
HA HA HA HA!
                (MOUTHING WORDS)
    HE LIKES US!
    HE LIKES US!
    HE THINKS WE'RE FUNNY!
HAMLET ISN'T JUST HAMLET.
OH, NO. NO.
    OH, NO.
NO, HAMLET IS ME...
HAMLET IS BOSNIA...
HAMLET IS...THIS DESK.
HAMLET IS THE AIR.
HAMLET IS MY GRANDMOTHER.
HAMLET IS EVERYTHING
YOU'VE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT SEX,
ABOUT, UM...
ABOUT GEOLOGY.
                GEOLOGY.
I-IN A VERY LOOSE SENSE,
OF COURSE.
                CAN YOU FENCE?
I ADORE TO FENCE.
I LIVE TO FENCE.
IN A SENSE...
I FENCE TO LIVE.
    (HUMMING FANFARE)
HAVE I--HAVE I GOT IT?
        WELL, WE'RE GONNA SEE
        A LOT OF PEOPLE--
        ACTUALLY, EXTRAORDINARY
        AMOUNT OF PEOPLE.
        I CAN'T TELL YOU UNTIL
        THE END OF THE CYCLE.
IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT?
A LITTLE SPIRIT GUM,
A LITTLE IMAGINATION?
ONE BECOMES...
TOTALLY UNRECOGNIZABLE.
IN MY EARLY DAYS IN REP,
THEY USED TO CALL ME
CARNFORTH "VARIED" GREVILLE...
    YOU KNOW...
BECAUSE OF ALL THE, UM...
YOU KNOW.
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
                        VARIETY.
THAT'S IT! YES, YES.
VARIETY OF CHARACTERS.
YES.
WELL, DOROTHY DRAB CERTAINLY
MADE AN IMPACT IN HERE, DARLING.
I SUPPOSE IT COULD BE MORE
DREARY IF YOU SMEARED
THE WALLS WITH SHEEP SHIT,
BUT IT'S HARDLY WORTH IT.
NO, YOU JUST KEEP IT
ANONYMOUS AND SUICIDAL.
I'M NOT HERE TO PLAY POLONIUS.
DIRTY GERTIE'S
GOT MY NAME ON IT.
I'M HERE TO PLAY THE QUEEN!
                UH, LOOK...
YOU HAVEN'T HAD A MATRONLY
CLEAVAGE NEAR YOU ALL WEEK.
YOU'RE STUCK FOR MONEY,
AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT
THE ANSWER TO YOUR PRAYERS.
I'M CLEAN, I'M CONSCIENTIOUS,
AND I TRAVEL WITH ME OWN TITS.
        TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
        I AM A BIT STUCK, AND...
    I DO WANT THIS PRODUCTION
    TO BE FREE AND EXPERIMENTAL.
WELL, THAT'S HOW I FEEL
ABOUT MOST THINGS, DARLING.
        ¶ MIL-I-TARY! ¶
    CLIPPETY-CLOPPETY,
    CLIPPETY-CLOPPETY.
    DOWN, ABOUT,
    AND JIGGETY-JIG.
        FOR ME, REGIONAL ACCENTS
        ARE NOT, UH, YOU KNOW,
        ARE NO PROBLEM AT ALL.
        THEY'RE VITALLY
        IMPORTANT, IN FACT.
        THERE'S NO SET VOICE
        FOR SHAKESPEARE.
        THAT'S--THAT'S
        RIDICULOUS.
I-I TRIED THIS
THIS MORNING A BIT.
(THICK SCOTTISH ACCENT)
NOW IS THE WINTER
OF OUR DISCONTENT
MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER
BY THAT SON OF YORK!
THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING
A CHILD ACTOR, YOU SEE?
I'VE ALREADY BEEN
IN THE BUSINESS FOR 7 CENTURIES.
            IT'S CERTAINLY
            AN IMPRESSIVE C.V.
BUT I'M NOT DOING IT
ANYMORE, RIGHT?
I'VE GOT TO PLAY
SOMEONE OLDER.
14 YEARS ON TOURING<i> PETER PAN</i>
 CAN GIVE YOU A COMPLEX.
                ARE YOUR EYES
                QUITE ALL RIGHT?
PERFECT.
    IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE
    NOT ACTUALLY LOOKING AT ME.
        YOU'RE LOOKING OFF--
        OFF TO ONE SIDE HERE.
EXACTLY. I OFTEN DO THAT
WHEN I FIRST MEET PEOPLE.
I LOOK OFF TO THE SIDE
TO WATCH THEIR AURA.
                    THEIR AURA?
MMM. THE AURA,
OR, AS OFTEN AS NOT,
JUST THE BIT OF SPACE
NEXT TO THEM,
WHICH CAN BE VERY
INTERESTING, CAN'T IT?
                DO YOU WEAR
                CONTACT LENSES?
NO, THEY'RE--I'M--
THEY MAKE ME--
THEY'RE UNCOMFORTABLE.
                WHY DON'T YOU
                WEAR GLASSES?
I DON'T NEED THEM.
CAN I DO MY PIECE NOW?
THEY SAID IT DIDN'T
HAVE TO BE SHAKESPEARE.
OH, GOOD. THIS IS
DEBBIE HARRY, THEN. AHEM.
¶ ONCE I FOUND LOVE ¶
¶ AND IT WAS A GAS ¶
¶ SOON FOUND OUT ¶
¶ HAD A HEART OF GLASS ¶
¶ SEEMED LIKE
THE REAL THING ¶
¶ ONLY TO FI-IND ¶
¶ ONCE YOU MISTRUST,
LOVE'S GONE BEHIND ¶
            (RIP)
IT WAS ALWAYS GONNA BE
DIFFICULT THIS TIME OF YEAR,
AND AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE,
BUT WE'VE GOT A GROUP OF PEOPLE
WHO ARE REALLY HUNGRY TO DO IT.
    THEY'RE HUNGRY 'CAUSE THEY
    HAVEN'T WORKED THIS CENTURY.
NEITHER HAVE I.
                    TOUCHE.
        HOW AM I GOING TO GET
        PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS
        DOWN TO THIS GODFORSAKEN
        VENUE?
IT'S NOT FOR THOSE
KINDS OF PEOPLE.
        OH, YOU MEAN LIKE
        EMPLOYER KIND OF PEOPLE?
LOOK, LOOK,
IT'S A ONE-OFF PRODUCTION
BY A GROUP OF, I SUSPECT,
MAD BUT PASSIONATE PEOPLE
WHO ARE REALLY HUNGRY
TO DO IT,
WHO'LL BE PERFORMING IT
IN A PLACE THAT REALLY NEEDS US.
IF WE DO IT WELL AND HONESTLY,
EVERYTHING ELSE WILL FOLLOW.
            I LOVE IT WHEN YOU
            GO ALL VISIONARY.
        (SIGHS) OH, YOU KNOW,
        YOU WERE REALLY CLOSE
        TO THAT MOVIE.
OH, REALLY.
                MM. REALLY.
    AND NOW DYLAN JUDD'S AGENT
    HAS GONE ALL GRAND
    AND IS ASKING FOR MILLIONS.
    SUCH A MISTAKE.
YOU'LL COME,
WON'T YOU?
        WE'LL SEE.
        I HAVE A FEELING
    IT MIGHT BE WORTH
    TRAVELING A VERY LONG WAY
        FOR TERRY DU BOIS'S
        GERTRUDE.
SO WHEN, EXACTLY, ARE YOU
GONNA GET TO THIS CHURCH?
        SUNDAY, LUNCHTIME,
        I HOPE.
        DEPENDS ON
        THE TRANSPORT CAPTAIN.
WHY? WHO'S THAT?
                    ME.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DRIVE
THAT OLD HEAP, ARE YOU?
WITH LIVE PEOPLE
IN IT?
        WITH ACTORS IN IT.
        THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.
    I'VE GOT NO CHOICE. IF I'M
    NOT PAYING THEM ANY MONEY,
    I'VE GOT TO LOOK AFTER THEM.
    LOOK, I'LL SEE YOU
    AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, OK?
JOE, JOE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
TOP OF THE HILL?
    BY THE CHURCH, KATE.
    LISTEN, I'VE GOT TO GO NOW.
    I'VE GOT TO GET
    THE FOOD IN FOR SUNDAY.
    I'M CATERING MANAGER, TOO.
    SEE YOU, LOVE. BYE.
NO, JOE, JOE,
YOU DON'T MEAN--
OH, GOD!
OH, CHRIST.
(BACKFIRE)
        Nina:
    SHALL I NAVIGATE?
Man: NO!
        Joe: IS EVERYTHING
        ALL RIGHT BACK THERE?
    Terry:
    MARVELOUS, DARLING!
                    (BACKFIRE)
    Tom: OH, LOOK.
    WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NAME.
Nina: I THINK
IT'S A SIGN.
        Henry: YES, LOVE,
        IT'S A ROAD SIGN.
                Vernon: I THINK
                IT'S SYMBOLIC.
(SHEEP BAA)
        UH, NOW LOOK,
        WE CAN'T ACTUALLY
        GET THE VEHICLE
        ANY CLOSER THAN THIS,
        SO WE'LL HAVE TO CARRY
        THE STUFF FROM HERE.
    WE'LL GET THE REST LATER.
    IT'S A LOVELY SHORT WALK.
        Vernon: AND UP A HILL,
        TOO. HOW WONDERFUL!
        PERFECT AFTER
        A JOURNEY LIKE THAT.
            Joe: WE WERE BROUGHT
            UP AROUND HERE.
            IT'S SUCH
            A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH.
            EVEN US KIDS
            LIKED GOING.
Nina: IT'S SUCH A SHAME
IT'S FALLEN INTO DISUSE.
            Vernon: LIKE MOST
            OF THIS COMPANY.
    Terry: SPEAK FOR YOURSELF,
    YOU CHEEKY WIT.
Carnforth: IT'S WONDERFULLY
PLEASURABLE FOR OUR AUDIENCE.
AH...THE ROAD IS LONG,
THOUGH FIRM AND STRONG
AND TINKLY
LIKE A DINNER GONG.
            Henry: DID YOU
            JUST MAKE THAT UP?
UH, NO, I THINK
IT'S BY, UM...
    UM...
NO, ACTUALLY, I THINK
I DID JUST MAKE THAT UP.
        Vernon: THAT IS
        TERRIFIC, ISN'T IT?
        LIKE OUT OF<i> WUTHERING</i>
        <i> HEIGHTS</i> OR SOMETHING.
    Nina: IT'S SO ROMANTIC
    AND YET SO SAD!
        Terry: IT'S GOT SORT
        OF FEMININE SADNESS,
        HASN'T IT, NINA? I CAN
        MAKE MY FIRST ENTRANCE
        FROM THAT SIDE.
    CERTAINLY WORTH
    THE TRUDGE, ISN'T IT?
AND A FANTASTIC POSITION
UP HERE ON THE HILL.
THERE MUST BE SOME TREMENDOUS
RUNS TO BE HAD AROUND HERE.
        YES. CERTAINLY
        ATMOSPHERIC
        BEING SURROUNDED
        BY DEAD PEOPLE.
                NOT MUCH OF A
                CHANGE FROM YOUR
                NORMAL AUDIENCE,
                THEN, HARRY.
            HENRY.
    WELL, FOLKS, THIS IS IT.
    THE OLD HILL CHURCH OF HOPE!
    WE'RE NOT JUST DOING A PLAY.
    WE'RE HERE ON A MISSION
    TO SAVE THIS PLACE,
    TO GET THE DEVELOPER OUT
    AND THE PEOPLE BACK IN!
                Molly: JOE!
    AH, THIS IS MY SISTER MOLLY!
    MOLLY, HEY, HOW ARE YA?
        (LAUGHS) OH! I THOUGHT
        YOU'D GOT IT WRONG!
        IT'S NOT THIS CHURCH.
        EVERYONE LOVES
        THIS CHURCH.
        IT'S THE BIG ONE ON
        THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE.
    NOT THE BIG HORRIBLE
    RED ONE?
                YEAH.
            THAT REALLY IS
            A DOG OF A CHURCH.
    GRAPHICALLY, ACTUALLY,
    IT ISN'T BAD--
    ALL THOSE NICE VERTICALS.
        SO MUCH FLATTER
        AROUND HERE.
    IT'S NOT NEARLY SO GOOD
    FOR WORKING A HEART RATE.
            WELL, AT LEAST
            I CAN GO TO TOWN
            IN MY DRESSING ROOM
            IN HERE, LOVE.
            I DO NEED SPACE
            FOR MY TALENT.
SPACE TO FIND IT.
                    SHUT UP.
HAVEN'T WE SEEN ENOUGH? I'M SICK
    OF THE SIGHT OF THE PLACE.
        CAN'T WE JUST
        GO TO THE DIGS?
            THESE ARE THE DIGS.
            IT'S THE ONLY WAY
            WE CAN AFFORD
            TO DO IT.
    WE'VE GOT FOOD, PEACHES, AND
    SLEEPING BAGS AND FUTONS.
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT ALL THAT
KEEN ON JAPANESE FOOD.
    Nina: OH! GOSH, IT'S
    INCREDIBLY ATMOSPHERIC!
                Terry:
                AND DAMP.
Joe: I REMEMBER THIS PLACE.
I USED TO GET DRAGGED IN HERE
    ONCE A MONTH ON SUNDAY NIGHT
    FOR EXTRA RELIGION.
OH, YES. MOM AND DAD MADE SURE
WE GOT OUR MONEY'S WORTH.
                    AND HAVE YOU
                    KEPT IT UP?
        CARNFORTH,
        WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE.
    HE MEANS THE FAITH.
    HAVE YOU KEPT UP THE FAITH?
        THOUGH IT IS VERY HARD.
        I MEAN, I'M TREMENDOUSLY
        SPIRITUAL,
        BUT I STILL FIND IT
        DIFFICULT TO MEDITATE
        FOR MORE THAN
        AN HOUR EACH DAY.
    YES. I SUSPECT
    THAT'S ABOUT ALL
    BUDDHA CAN TAKE
    FROM YOU, ISN'T IT?
                SO, MOLLY, WHY
                DOESN'T ANYONE
                USE THIS PLACE
                ANYMORE?
    OH, THEY DO, OR,
    RATHER, THEY DID
    UNTIL THIS BLOODY DEVELOPER
    GOT HOLD OF IT.
    BASICALLY, A LOT OF PEOPLE
    HAVE ABANDONED HOPE.
I KNOW HOW THEY
FEEL, LOVE.
OH, WHAT DRAMAS!
IS THIS THE LANDLORD?
        OH, RIGHT! RIGHT.
        LET ME INTRODUCE YOU.
        OUR DESIGNER!
        THIS IS FADGE.
            DID HE SAY VAGE?
I'M GLAD SHE USES
THE ABBREVIATION.
        FADGE, DARLING.
        FA, FA, FA.
        GIVE IT AN "F."
THINK IT'S A BIT EARLY
IN THE DAY FOR THAT, DARLING.
    IS THIS ENTIRE PRODUCTION
    GOING TO BE CONDUCTED
        THROUGH A STREAM
        OF INNUENDO?
            IS THERE
            A SURNAME, FADGE?
        YEAH, IS IT FADGE SMITH
        OR FADGE FADGINGTON?
    JUST FADGE, DARLING.
    YOU KNOW, THIS PLACE
    IS INCREDIBLE.
    I FEEL SOMETHING
    VERY POWERFUL HERE.
    VERY STRANGE AND POWERFUL.
        POWERFUL AND STRANGE.
        I FEEL THAT, TOO, FADGE.
POWERFUL AND STRANGE
AND DAMP.
    I WAS JUST SAYING, FADGE,
    THERE'S MARVELOUS
    OPPORTUNITIES HERE FOR--
YOU SEE, WE MUST MAKE
THE DESIGN ALL ABOUT SPACE.
PEOPLE IN SPACE.
THINGS IN SPACE.
WOMEN IN SPACE.
MEN IN SPACE.
        SO WE'D SORT OF BE...
        SPACEMEN?
            IN A SENSE.
        SO, CARNFORTH, WE GET
        TO SLEEP IN THE CRYPT.
        YOU THINK THEY MIGHT BE
        TRYING TO IMPLY
        SOMETHING ABOUT
        OUR ACTING?
WHAT, THAT IT'S
A BIT CRYPTIC?
            NO, THAT IT'S DEAD.
OH. (CHUCKLES)
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE, UH...
SEEN WORSE IN THE ARMY.
                    WERE YOU
                    IN THE ARMY?
    UM...
NO. NOT STRICTLY
SPEAKING, NO.
FEELS LIKE THE ARMY,
CERTAINLY.
UH, VERNON...
                    MM-HMM?
DO YOU THINK THE BOSS
WOULD BE OFFENDED
IF I POPPED OUT DIRECTLY
TO THE LOCAL HOSTELRY
IN LIEU OF
THIS EVENING'S MEAL?
        I DON'T KNOW, CARNFORTH.
        WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM?
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTORS,
DARLING, NOT CIVILIANS.
DISCIPLINE IS WHAT THEY NEED.
            YOU'RE NOT HERE
            FOR LONG.
            REALLY, IT'LL SORT
            ITSELF OUT.
21 DAYS, LOVE. 63 MEALS,
AND 8 TRILLION CUPS OF TEA.
NOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
ARSE WIPES THAT RUNS TO,
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
THE ONE HOLDING THE LOO ROLL,
YOU'LL TAKE MY ADVICE--
WE'LL DRAW UP A CLEANING
AND THE COOKING ROTA NOW.
        IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE
        I SPENT TIME WITH JOE,
        I'VE FORGOTTEN
        HOW ACTORS BEHAVE.
        THIS IS JUST LIKE BEING
        IN THE BOY SCOUTS.
DON'T SAY THAT, LOVE.
THEIR PANTS'LL NEVER DRY.
    I DON'T SEE WHY I HAVE
    TO SHARE WITH A POOF, LOVE.
COME ON NOW, HARRY.
                        HENRY!
WE'RE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD.
A PERSON'S SEXUALITY
IS IRRELEVANT.
        I COULDN'T CARE LESS
        IF HE SHAGS HAMSTERS.
        THEY'RE ALL
        THE BLOODY SAME!
        THE ENTIRE BRITISH
        THEATER'S DOMINATED
    BY THE CLASS SYSTEM AND
    A BUNCH OF OXBRIDGE HOMOS!
        I DON'T THINK TERRY'S
        OXBRIDGE.
WELL, IT HARDLY MATTERS.
THEY'RE ALL DRAMA QUEENS.
I HOPE YOUR GERTRUDE'S
A QUIET WOMAN.
        YES. I WANTED TO HAVE
        A WORD WITH YOU
        ABOUT THAT, ACTUALLY.
WHEN DOES SHE ARRIVE,
BY THE WAY?
I HOPE SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE
LATE FOR THE READ-THROUGH.
    WELL, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
    MEET FOR 5 MINUTES
    BEFORE THEN TO DISCUSS
    MY CONCEPT OF YOUR QUEEN.
IT'S NOT BAD, THOUGH,
IS IT?
STAGE...FEELS GOOD.
                OH, YEAH, YEAH.
YOU CAN COMMAND THE AUDIENCE.
    (CHUCKLES)
    HENRY IRVING
    WOULD HAVE LOVED THIS.
        IT 'TIS...
    THE CAUSE, MY SOUL.
    IT IS THE CAUSE.
    LET ME NOT MIMIC TO YOU
    YOUR CHASTE STARS.
        IT 'TIS...
        THE CAUSE!
        HAH!
        (GROANS)
IRVING AS HE WOULD HAVE
PLAYED OTHELLO, LOVE.
VERY STRANGE GESTURES,
BUT TOTALLY HYPNOTIC.
        LOOK,
        ARE YOU GONNA BE OK
        WITH THE BEDROOM
        ARRANGEMENTS?
        I MEAN, WE COULD ASK
        SOMEBODY TO MOVE.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I'LL STAY THERE.
I COULD ALWAYS SLEEP
WITH MY ARSE IN A BUCKET.
    OHH...
<i> HAMLET</i> AT CHRISTMAS
WITH A GROUP
OF LIKE-MINDED ARTISTS
IN A ROUGH BUT
REALLY REAL LOCATION!
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
THAT WOULD MAKE THIS JOB BETTER.
                    SALARY?
(CHUCKLES)
OH, IS THAT THE DESIGN
FOR THIS THEN?
        IT'S NOT FINISHED YET.
OH. SORRY.
                    AHEM.
WHERE DID I PUT
MY MOISTURIZER?
            YOU CAN CALL ME FA.
    WHAT?
                IT'S A NICKNAME.
            REALLY CLOSE FRIENDS
            CALL ME FA.
    OH.
WELL, I'M VERY TOUCHED
YOU SHOULD ALLOW ME
TO USE IT.
I MEAN...
IT'S SLIGHTLY HARDER
TO SAY THAN FADGE,
BUT IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
    FA.
    THANK YOU.
        WHY ARE YOU RUBBING
        LOW-CALORIE MAYONNAISE
            INTO YOUR FACE?
        WELL, HERE'S TO MOLLY.
            CHEERS.
        All: TO MOLLY.
    THAT IS RATHER AN AMUSING
    LITTLE CHIANTI.
WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY GIVEN IT
A GOOD ROAD TEST, HAVEN'T YOU?
YOU CARRY ON DRINKING
LIKE THIS,
IT'LL AFFECT
NEXT YEAR'S HARVEST.
            ACTUALLY, LET'S JUST
            TALK A LITTLE BIT
            ABOUT THE FOOD
            AND DRINK SITUATION.
    YES, WHEN DO WE GET
    OUR EXPENSES, LOVE?
        WELL, THE POINT IS,
        I SUPPOSE,
        THAT THE MOST ECONOMIC
        WAY OF DOING THIS
            WOULD BE TO OPERATE
            OUR HOUSEHOLD BUDGET
            FROM A CENTRAL FUND.
        YOU MEAN THERE
        ARE NO EXPENSES.
            NOT IN THE
            CONVENTIONAL SENSE.
        IS THERE ANOTHER SENSE?
WELL, THERE'S A CROOKED
BASTARD WHO DIDN'T TELL US
BEFORE WE GOT THE JOB SENSE.
                WELL, NOW,
                THAT'S NOT FAIR.
                YOU WANTED
                THIS JOB.
            THIS IS JOE'S
            OWN MONEY.
            HE MUST SPEND IT
            HOW HE THINKS FIT.
            THIS WAS A VERY
            GENEROUS MEAL.
YES. YES, THE CHILI
WAS VERY NICE.
BUT IT REALLY HAS TO BE
THE LAST RED MEAT I HAVE.
I MEAN, ALREADY I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO DETOX AND IRRIGATE.
COLONICALLY, THIS HAS
SET ME RIGHT BACK.
            YES. YES, WELL,
            UH, SORRY, TOM.
            WE'LL ALL BEAR THAT
            IN MIND
            AS WE IMPLEMENT
            THE COOKING ROSTER.
        NOW MOLLY, THANK GOD,
        IS GOING TO DO THE
        SHOPPING FOR SUPPLIES.
        BUT WE WILL PROBABLY
        NEED TO BE ECONOMIC
        WITH OUR PROVISIONS.
I THINK HE MEANS
YOU'VE DRUNK OUR ENTIRE
CHRISTMAS WINE ALLOWANCE,
MR. GREVILLE.
    I HOPE NOT.
            LEAVE HER ALONE,
            MRS. GRUMPY.
        I THINK NANCY NERVES
        IS RATTLING YOUR BARS
            ABOUT TOMORROW,
            ISN'T SHE?
        OH, YES,
        I'M NERVOUS, TOO.
        MY STOMACH'S
        FULL OF SNAKES.
        YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE
        GET BUTTERFLIES
        IN THEIR TUMMY,
        BUT I GET THESE
        SORT OF SNAKE THINGS.
THOSE ARE YOUR
INTESTINES, LOVE.
        I CAN FEEL MY NIPPLES
        STIFFENING!
            IT'S A GOOD SIGN.
            A VERY GOOD SIGN.
            (BREATHY VOICE)
            HARD AND QUICK.
            HARD AND QUICK!
            IT HAPPENS THE NIGHT
            BEFORE A PRODUCTION.
            I FEEL IT TO BE
            A TREMENDOUS OMEN.
            WELL, WE'RE NEVER
            SHORT OF A SHOCK
            FROM MR. MAD,
            ARE WE?
WHAT IS ALL THIS CALLING BOYS
BY GIRLS' NAMES AND STUFF?
I'M COMPLETELY LOST!
        IT'S CAMP, DARLING.
        THEATRICAL CAMP. BANTER.
        KEEPS US ALL ON
        THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW.
        YOU PUT A GIRL'S NAME
        IN FRONT OF ANY WORD
            JUST TO SPICE UP
            YOUR SENTENCES.
            AND ALWAYS REFER
            TO A MAN AS A SHE
            AND A WOMAN AS A HE.
            FOR EXAMPLE,
        IF I WERE TO COMMENT
        ON HARRY OVER THERE...
    HENRY.
        I MIGHT SAY, "OOH,
        MANDY MISERY'S SHAFTED
        MRS. WAKEFIELD GOOD
        AND PROPER, HASN'T SHE?"
OH, I SEE.
        WELL, YOU WILL, DARLING.
        AND YOU NEVER KNOW.
        THERE MIGHT BE
        A LITTLE MORE CAMPERY
        BEFORE THE FIRST NIGHT.
    (MURMURING)
THE POINT IS, THERE IS
NOWHERE FOR PEOPLE TO GO,
APART FROM THE PUB,
IF THEY CAN AFFORD IT.
I MEAN, THERE'S NO VILLAGE HALL,
THERE'S NO ART CENTER.
WE NEED THIS PLACE
TO GIVE PEOPLE A FOCUS,
PROVE TO THE COUNCIL
THAT THERE IS A COMMUNITY
WORTH MAINTAINING,
THAT THERE IS A COMMUNITY!
            THEN IT WOULD BE
            WONDERFUL
            IF IT WAS
            A GREAT PRODUCTION!
    DON'T FEEL UNDER
    ANY PRESSURE, JOE.
            WHAT IS THE SHOW,
            ANYWAY?
            THAT BUGGER WOULDN'T
            EVEN TELL ME.
        OH, I HOPE IT'S
        SOMETHING CHRISTMASY,
                A COMEDY.
        Tom: IT'S<i> HAMLET.</i>
                GREAT. (SIGHS)
            OH, HELLO, KIDS.
        DO STOP WATCHING<i> MIGHTY</i>
        <i> MORPHIN POWER RANGERS</i>
            AND COME AND WATCH
            A 400-YEAR-OLD PLAY
            ABOUT A DEPRESSED
            ARISTOCRAT. I MEAN,
        IT'S SOMETHING YOU
        CAN REALLY RELATE TO.
WE'VE GOT OUR WORK
CUT OUT.
        (SIGHS)
        WHO'S PLAYING HAMLET?
            OH, THAT'S SO BLOODY
            TYPICAL OF YOU!
I'LL TAKE YOU HOME!
YOU CAN WALK OFF
YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT.
    OH, CAN I COME, TOO,
    JUST FOR THE AIR?
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
COMING THIS ROUTE.
IT'S ON OUR WAY HOME.
        NOT AT ALL. IT'S
        A CHANCE TO CALM DOWN
        AFTER
        ALL THE EXCITEMENT.
        I COULDN'T HAVE GONE
        TO SLEEP RIGHT AWAY.
I JUST WANTED TO SEE THIS PLACE
AGAIN. I'D SET MY HEART ON IT!
            THE OTHER CHURCH IS
            MUCH MORE PRACTICAL.
I KNOW, BUT THIS IS
WHERE I GREW UP.
IT'S JUST TYPICALLY STUPID OF ME
NOT TO HAVE CHECKED PROPERLY
WITH MOLL,
CHARGING AWAY AS USUAL.
            THAT'S ENTHUSIASM.
            IT'S IMPORTANT.
            NOT MANY PEOPLE
            HAVE IT LIKE YOU.
I HOPE I CAN
KEEP IT UP.
            I BEG YOUR PARDON?
DON'T YOU START.
                ARE YOU SCARED
                ABOUT TOMORROW?
ABSOLUTELY PETRIFIED.
RIGHT NOW I JUST WISH
I'D GOT THAT STUPID PART
IN THAT STUPID FILM
AND HAVE TO TURN UP
FOR 6 MONTHS IN A FUNNY SUIT
AND DRINK TEA ALL DAY.
            LOOK, WE'RE ALL
            RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
            YOU WON'T FAIL.
I DID ONCE BEFORE,
YOU KNOW?
FADGE AND I BOTH...
DIFFERENT SHOWS. SAME
BULL-AT-A-GATE MENTALITY.
COMPLETE COCK UP.
ALL MONEY LOST,
ALL CONFIDENCE LOST WITH IT.
MY DAD WENT BUST. MY FIANCEE
LEFT ME FOR ANOTHER MAN.
WONDERFUL TIMING. ONLY AN
ACTRESS CAN CARRY THAT OFF.
NO OFFENSE.
I SHOULDN'T BE TALKING
TO YOU LIKE THIS, SHOULD I?
        I'M FLATTERED THAT YOU
        CAN CONFIDE IN ME.
        MARTIN ALWAYS SAYS
        THAT IF YOU CAN FACE
        YOUR TROUBLES AND FEARS
        AND JUST
        ACKNOWLEDGE THEM,
        YOU'RE HALFWAY TO
        LETTING THEM FLY AWAY.
        I ALWAYS TRY
        TO REMEMBER THAT.
THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.
                        MM-HMM.
WHO'S MARTIN?
                MY HUSBAND.
            RIGHT.
    UH...THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
    A VERY EXCITING MOMENT.
    WE'RE ABOUT TO EMBARK UPON
    OUR VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY.
    I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE
        BIT ABOUT<i> HAMLET...</i>
        NOW, ACTUALLY,
    IT IS A VERY DARK PLAY.
            I SEE IT AS A VERY
            LONG PLAY, DARLING.
        SALLY SCISSORS IS GOING
        TO APPEAR, WE HOPE.
    YES, NO, I'VE GOT
    A LOT OF CUTS.
    BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO FOR
THE BENEFIT OF THIS READ-THROUGH
    IS TO READ THE WHOLE THING.
OH, GREAT. WE'VE ONLY
GOT 10 DAYS' REHEARSAL,
BUT LET'S SPEND 15 HOURS
READING THE WHOLE BLOODY THING
ON DAY ONE.
    I'LL GIVE YOU THE CUTS
    DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS.
        IT'S VITAL WE READ
        THE WHOLE THING ONCE.
    HEAR, HEAR.
        RIGHT. RIGHT.
        WE'RE NOT GONNA WASTE
        ANY MORE TIME
        ON SPEECHES AND THINGS.
        I WOULD JUST LIKE
        TO SAY AT THIS STAGE,
    PLEASE ENJOY THE READING.
        DON'T FEEL OBLIGED
    TO, UM, GIVE PERFORMANCES.
    I DON'T WANT THAT.
    BUT DO AVOID MUMBLING,
        THROWING IT AWAY.
    LET'S REALLY HEAR THIS PLAY.
    OK, LET'S REALLY
    LISTEN TO EACH OTHER!
        AND RELAX! OK?
        OK. OFF WE GO.
    UM...COULD I JUST
    MENTION SMOKING?
    I THINK IT WOULD BE
    REALLY A GOOD IDEA
    IF THIS WAS
    A NONSMOKING READ-THROUGH.
    UH, RIGHT. IF YOU COULD
    ALL BE SENSITIVE TO THAT.
    THANKS VERY MUCH, TOM.
            OK.
WHO'S THERE?!
    GOOD HAMLET, CAST
    THY NIGHTED COLOR OFF,
    AND LET THINE EYE LOOK LIKE
    A FRIEND ON DENMARK.
    DO NOT FOREVER
    WITH THY VAILED LIDS
    SEEK FOR THY NOBLE FATHER
    IN THE DUST?

        (COUGHING)
            I CAN'T STAND POOFS!
    HENRY!
        GERTRUDE WAS NOT WRITTEN
        AS A SHIRT LIFTER!
SHAKESPEARE HIMSELF
WAS PROBABLY BISEXUAL.
IT'S AN ELIZABETHAN
CONCEPT.
IT'LL FREE UP A WHOLE
PART OF THE SHOW!
            A DYKE I COULD HAVE
            COPED WITH.
            I DON'T MIND
            THE ODD DIESEL.
            BUT I'M NOT HAVING
            ME TONGUE DOWN THAT!
    METHINKS THE LADY DOTH
    PROTEST TOO MUCH, DARLING.
OH, HE'S OLD SCHOOL.
HE'S JUST TRYING TO PROVE
THAT HE'S REALLY 29,
WITH 6 TESTICLES
AND A 4-FOOT DICK.
        CHAPS, CHAPS,
        I'M JUST SLIPPING
        DOWN TO THE--
        POST OFFICE
        FOR A QUICK, UM...
        STAMP. HA.
                I CANNOT BELIEVE
                THE CUTS.
            I CANNOT BELIEVE
            THE CUTS.
                I CANNOT<i> BELIEVE</i>
               <i> THE CUTS!</i>
    CAN YOU BELIEVE
    THE CUTS, TOM?
                NO! I CAN'T
                BELIEVE THEM!
TOM, YOU'RE PLAYING
ALL THOSE PARTS.
I MEAN, THAT'S THE REAL
CHALLENGE, ISN'T IT?
TO MAKE THEM ALL
EXCITING AND DIFFERENT.
    AND BRIEF.
                    EXACTLY.
            I'M GOING TO SPEAK
            TO MY AGENT.
        THAT'S RIGHT, DARLING.
        THREATEN TO WALK.
        THE MANAGEMENT WILL
        QUAKE IN THEIR BOOTS.
OH, PLEASE DON'T
LEAVE, TOM.
I THINK YOU'D BE
A WONDERFUL LAERTES.
            WELL, I HAVE PUT
            QUITE A LOT OF WORK
            INTO IT, ACTUALLY.
            NORMALLY, I'D HAVE
            TRIED TO SPEND
            A MONTH IN DENMARK
            TO GET IT RIGHT.
    SO WHAT DID YOU DO
    THIS TIME?
            I BORROWED THIS BOOK
            ON THE EIFFEL TOWER.
            YOU KNOW IN THE PLAY
            HE GOES TO FRANCE?
            I JUST WANTED
            AN IMAGE IN MY HEAD.
        WELL, THERE'LL BE PLENTY
        OF ROOM FOR IT, DARLING.
    IS JOE ALL RIGHT?
            OH, HE'S FINE, LOVE.
            HE'S JUST HUMORING
            MRS. WAKEFIELD.
        WILL HE LEAVE?
        IS IT ALWAYS LIKE THIS
        ON THE FIRST DAY
        OF A PLAY?
SORT OF POLITICAL,
I THINK.
    MARKING OUT TERRITORY.
        YES, SHE'S A RUTHLESS
        STEPDAUGHTER, THAT ONE.
            DID YOU ENJOY THE
            READ-THROUGH, FADGE?
    I THOUGHT IT WAS
    EXTRAORDINARY.
    AND ALSO,
    IN A STRANGE WAY, BANAL.
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'VE DECIDED
ON AN EXTRAORDINARILY
BANAL DESIGN?
        I CAN'T--I NEVER
        DECIDE AT THIS STAGE.
        ONE HAS TO REMAIN
        OPEN.
    OPEN AND INDECISIVE?
STOP TEASING,
VERNON.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THE SET MODEL...FA.
    (GIGGLING)
            UM...
    ISN'T...THIS, UM...
            (BELCHES)
            PARDON.
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO EASY
LICKING THOSE STAMPS
AT LUNCHTIME,
MRS. GREVILLE.
    YES, BUT...THIS IS...
    SORT OF...EXACTLY
    WHERE WE ARE, ISN'T IT?
EXACTLY!
    BRILLIANT.
                    SO WHAT'S
                    THE DESIGN?
SMOKE.
                    SMOKE?
PEOPLE IN SPACE
IN SMOKE.
                        OH,
                        GOSH.
THIS BUILDING
DOES EVERYTHING ELSE.
SMOKE GIVES US
ATMOSPHERE, HISTORY.
                    BRONCHITIS.
    WHAT ABOUT PERIOD,
    THEN, DARLING?
JOE?
    I THINK, UH, I THINK
    WE SHOULD CREATE THE PERIOD.
    I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD
    BE ELIZABETHAN.
    THAT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS.
ALTHOUGH IT IS AN ELIZABETHAN
PLAY, ISN'T IT?
        DON'T BRING UP THE
        TEDIOUS DETAILS, LOVE.
    IT SHOULD BE NO PERIOD.
    IT SHOULD BE<i> OUR</i> PERIOD.
    WHEN EVERYBODY'S COME UP
    WITH CONTRIBUTIONS
    TO CHARACTER AND COSTUME,
THE PERIOD OR STYLE WILL EMERGE.
    THAT'S THE NATURE
    OF THIS COLLABORATION!
                    IS COP-OUT
                    1 WORD OR 2?
        YOU'RE BEING A NAUGHTY,
        CYNICAL SAUSAGE, VERNON.
OOH!
            OOH!
    THANK YOU, NINA. WE'LL BE
    HAVING DISCUSSIONS TODAY
ABOUT CHARACTER AND COSTUME
TO SET US OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT,
    AND WE'LL START REHEARSALS
        PROPERLY TOMORROW
    WITH THE FIRST SCENE
        OF THE PLAY.
STARTING WITH THE FIRST SCENE?
OH, SHE'S SO RADICAL!
            SHUT UP, BITCH.
    I CAN TAKE EVERY PERIOD
        WITH ME.
    THAT'S WHAT JOE SAID.
    THE STYLE WILL EMERGE.
        THAT'S RIGHT.
    THAT'S EVERYTHING.
I WEAR MY OWN PROPS, LOVE.
I BRING MY OWN BREASTS.
YOU LOOK AFTER
THE OTHER CHILDREN.
    THE THING IS, JOE,
    I'VE NOTICED THAT I'M,
    UH, ACTUALLY PLAYING
    2 CHARACTERS
    WHO APPEAR ON THE STAGE
    AT THE SAME TIME,
    AS IT WERE.
    AND, UH...
ACTUALLY, JOE,
I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHETHER I COULD
MENTION THE CUTS.
I THINK THEY'RE
BRILLIANT--BRILLIANT!
SO CLEVER
WH-WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
IT'S JUST THAT LAERTES
HAS LOST 4 KEY LINES.
    PERHAPS YOU'D MAYBE
    PLAN SOMETHING
    PERHAPS WITH MIRRORS?
I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHETHER AT SOME POINT
WE MIGHT REINSTATE THEM.
NO, NO, LET ME DO THEM
FOR YOU.
                OK, DO IT.
OH, HEAVENS!
    ARE YOU VERY MUCH LONGER?
    IT'S FREEZING IN HERE.
            IT'S MORE OF
            A MOVEMENT THING.
MOVE?
            FADGE CAN HELP.
LINES, LIES--YOU SEE--
DID YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?
        CAREFUL, CAREFUL.
WORRY ABOUT PRESS?
        CAN'T WE GET
    THE FLOCK SORTED OUT?
AND I THOUGHT I COULD
RIP THE SHIRT OFF
AND SORT OF AB-SAIL
DOWN FROM THE ORGAN
FOR "WHERE IS MY FATHER?"
THEY DO SOME WONDERFUL
BODY OILS NOW.
    I DON'T WANT HER
    TO WEAR GLASSES!
            RIGHT. YOU FELL
            OVER THE BALCONY
            GETTING INTO BED
            LAST NIGHT.
    DOESN'T THE LIGHT
    READ ON THIS?
            I THINK A BIG NOSE
            WOULD BE GREAT.
            DID YOU SEE
            <i> CYRANO DE BERGERAC?</i>
            THAT KINDA SIZE.
    I WANT 2 SHOULDER PADS.
    HE'S GOTTA BE BUTCH.
NOW, LOOK, YOU'RE ACTUALLY
GONNA HAVE TO BE ME
DURING THESE REHEARSALS.
SO I CAN WATCH
THE SCENES.
            OH, GREAT! THANKS
            FOR THE WARNING.
            SO UNLIKE YOU.
        HOW DOES<i> HERR DIREKTOR</i>
       <i> REHEARSE HIS PART?</i>
OH, WE'LL FIND TIME. AND
I'LL MAKE ALL YOUR BEST BITS.
SEEM TO REMEMBER YOU WERE
RATHER BETTER THAN ME
DURING ALL THOSE
AMATEUR DRAMATICS.
        WELL, YES, 'CAUSE
        THAT'S WHERE I DO IT.
        AS OPPOSED TO THINKING
            PEOPLE MIGHT
            PAY ME TO DO IT.
YES. HORRIBLE CONCEPT,
THAT, ISN'T IT?
IT'S CAUGHT ME OUT
BEFORE NOW.
        BUT YOU STILL PERSIST.
JUST ABOUT. I THINK THIS IS
WHAT WE CALL THE LAST GASP.
        SO WHY DON'T YOU MAKE IT
    EASIER ON YOURSELF
    THIS TIME BY DOING A COMEDY
    OR SOMETHING SOMEBODY
    MIGHT BE INTERESTED TO SEE?
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S WHERE YOU
AND ME PART COMPANY AS ALWAYS.
I THINK IF WE DO THIS WITH
HUMOR, PASSION, AND REALITY,
PEOPLE WILL BE INTERESTED
IN SEEING IT.
I SAW THIS PLAY WHEN I WAS 15.
IT CHANGED MY LIFE!
YOU DON'T FORGET THAT!
I DON'T THINK I WAS
ANY DIFFERENT THEN
FROM YOUR HORMONALLY
CONFUSED KIDS NOW.
ALL I WAS EVER INTERESTED IN
WAS GIRLS AND WANKING.
UNFORTUNATELY, HARDLY
EVER IN THAT ORDER.
I SAW THIS PLAY. IT SPOKE
TO MY HEART AND MY HEAD
AND MY CHIEF
REPRODUCTIVE ORGAN.
            WILL THAT GO IN
            THE PROGRAM NOTES?
    Fadge: RELEASE THE PAIN.
    GET OUT, GET OUT!
    DRIVE IT AWAY!
    UP AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN,
    AND OUT OF YOUR HEADS,
    OUT OF YOUR HEADS.
FEEL THE PAIN IN YOUR BODY,
FEEL IT OUT, AND GET IT OUT.
YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
YOU DON'T LIKE IT.
AND IT BECOMES
A TRAIN OF FEAR,
A TRAIN OF FEAR.
A TRAIN OF FEAR.
GET OUT!
AND WE CRY OUT.
AND WE CRY OUT.
                    WHOO WOO!
        All: WHOO WOO!
WHO'S THERE?
        GREAT! TERRIFIC.
        HUGE POTENTIAL.
    (SLAM)
SORRY, SORRY,
SORRY, SORRY.
                IT'S A BIT LIMP.
    LIMP?
            YOU KNOW, HE'S JUST
            SEEN A GHOST.
        HE'S PROBABLY EXPECTING
        TO SEE ANOTHER ONE.
        <i> HAMLET</i> IS A TREMENDOUS
        GHOST STORY.
            NOW, I WANT TO SEE
            THAT FEAR.
            I WANT TO SMELL
            THAT FEAR.
I SEE, I SEE.
THAT'S GOOD. FEAR.
                ALL RIGHT.
            LET'S START AGAIN.
    (SAME AS BEFORE)
    WHO'S THERE?!
            NO, NO.
            IT--IT STILL
            DOESN'T CONVINCE ME.
        LET'S JUST TAKE
        A LITTLE TIME OUT HERE
        TO GROUND THIS
        IN SOME SORT OF REALITY.
        YOU TELL ME, CARNFORTH.
    WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT
    YOU WERE REALLY TERRIFIED?
        CAN YOU REMEMBER
        WHEN THAT WAS,
        OR IF THERE WAS
        SUCH A TIME?
    UM...
YES, YES!
I CAN REMEMBER.
UM...I WAS ON MY WAY
TO HAVE SUNDAY LUNCH
WITH MY MUM.
IT WAS HER BIRTHDAY.
I REMEMBER. BIT OVERDUE.
AND...GOT A FLAT TIRE
ON THE MOTORWAY.
(EXHALES)
WELL, IT WAS...
TOUCH AND GO WHETHER I WAS
GONNA GET THERE IN TIME.
PRETTY TERRIFIED THEN,
YOU KNOW?
        AND HOW DID THIS TERROR
        MANIFEST ITSELF?
    WELL...
IT PROBABLY TOOK
A LITTLE LONGER
TO CHANGE THE TIRE
THAN IT WOULD HAVE--
HANDS SHAKING,
THAT SORT OF THING.
                    RIGHT...
            OK. LET'S BRING
            THAT SITUATION HERE.
            (WHISPERS)
            That fear...
    Fear...
        ALL RIGHT.
        LET'S HAVE ANOTHER GO!
    WHO'S THERE?!
        NO, NO, NO, YOU DON'T
        HAVE TO CHANGE THE TIRE.
I'M SO SORRY.
SORRY, SORRY, EVERYBODY.
    TRICKY FIRST MORNING.
            YES, YES.
            FIRST SCENES ARE
            ALWAYS SO DIFFICULT.
    I CAN FEEL THE PRODUCTION
    IN HERE ALREADY.
    I CAN FEEL YOUR PAIN.
CAN YOU, TOM?
        RELAX.
            (BONES CRACK)
AAH!
            BUT NOW, MY COUSIN
            HAMLET, AND MY SON.
A LITTLE MORE THAN KIN
AND LESS THAN KIND.
            HOW IS IT
            THAT THE CLOUDS
            STILL HANG ON YOU?
NOT SO, MY LORD.
I AM TOO MUCH IN THE SUN.
    (CAMPY VOICE) GOOD HAMLET,
    CAST THY NIGHTED COLOR OFF,
    AND LET THINE EYE LOOK
    LIKE A FRIEND ON DENMARK.
                IS HE GONNA PLAY
                IT LIKE THAT?
        LIKE WHAT,
        YOU RUDE GIRL?
            LIKE LARRY THE LAMB
            ON SPEED.
RIGHT. JUST STOP
BOTH OF YOU THERE.
HENRY, IF YOU'LL LEAVE THE
INTERRUPTIONS TO ME. THANK YOU.
TERRY, LOOK, I AM SLIGHTLY
CONCERNED ABOUT THE VOICE.
THE GENERAL MOVEMENT'S FINE,
BUT THE VOICE IS JUST A LITTLE--
        IT'S WHAT THEY ALL DO,
        ALL THE GRAND DAMES.
    THEY DON'T TALK LIKE
    THEY DO IN THE REAL WORLD.
        THEY PUT ON THE OLD
        SECRET GRAVEL,
        THE TREASURED TRILL,
        THE EMOTIONAL BREAK
        MIDDLE OF THE LINE,
        THE OPERATIC CADENZA.
        I'M NOT MAKING IT UP.
        THEY DO!
SURE, AND SOMETIMES
IT'S VERY GOOD,
AND SOMETIMES
THEY'RE VERY WRONG,
AND THEY GIVE SHAKESPEARE
A BAD NAME.
TECHNICALLY,
IT IS BRILLIANT,
BUT YOU JUST DON'T
SOUND LIKE A HUMAN BEING.
        MORE LIKE A ROBOT
        WITH PILES.
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I MEANT.
    IT'S WHAT I HEAR WHEN I GO
    TO THE CLASSICAL THEATER.
        I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT
        YOU DID.
HAVE A LITTLE THINK ABOUT
SOMETHING MORE NATURAL.
I THINK YOU'LL DO IT
BRILLIANTLY.
ALL RIGHT,
HERE WE GO!
    ACTUALLY, TERRY,
    SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF.
SOMEBODY TOLD ME ABOUT IT.
YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL
YOU DON'T INVERT YOUR
OPENING LINE AS GERTRUDE.
APPARENTLY, THERE'S
QUITE A FAMOUS COCK UP.
INSTEAD OF SAYING, "GOOD HAMLET,
CAST THY NIGHTED COLOR OFF,"
YOU CAN END UP SAYING,
"GOOD HAMLET, CAST OFF
THY COLORED NIGHTIE." (LAUGHS)
I MEAN--I MEAN, YOU PROBABLY
WON'T DO THAT YOURSELF.
    I JUST--
ANYONE LIKE SOME TEA?
        BLOODY LANDLORD!
                WHAT?
WELL, YOU KNOW
YOU PAID THE RENT.
    YEAH. 3 WEEKS IN ADVANCE.
        HE SAYS HE WANTS A
        WEEK'S RENT OUT OF THAT
FOR UNPAID ELECTRICITY BILLS
THAT HE SAYS
THE SCHOOL'S LIABLE FOR!
                ARE YOU LIABLE?
OF COURSE NOT!
        CHALLENGE IT!
                WELL, WE WILL,
BUT HE'S STALLING
UNTIL AFTER CHRISTMAS.
        OOH! CAN HE DO THAT?
OF COURSE NOT,
BUT HE'S A SHIT,
            AND HE ALREADY
            HAS YOUR CASH.
    WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
            HE WANTS ANOTHER
            WEEK'S RENT,
            OR HE'LL TURN US
            OUT.
        WE WON'T GO.
            THEN,
            HE SAYS HE'LL CUT
        ALL THE SERVICES OFF--
        WATER, GAS, ELECTRIC.
    I'VE SPOKEN TO THE COUNCIL.
    HE'S WITHIN HIS RIGHTS.
        IF US OR THE SCHOOL
        DON'T PAY UP,
    WE'VE CONTRAVENED THE TERMS
    OF A SPECIAL PERFORMING--
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THAT!
        I DIDN'T PLAN IT, JOE!
WELL, WHEN IS HIS DEADLINE?
        END OF THE FINAL WEEK,
        DAY BEFORE WE OPEN OR
        HE'LL SEND HIS MATES IN
        TO CLOSE US DOWN!
I DON'T HAVE £700!
            WELL, NEITHER DO I!
    ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
    ALL RIGHT.
    DON'T TELL THE ACTORS.
HELLO. SORRY
TO INTERRUPT.
I JUST CAME TO SAY
WELL DONE!
BOTH OF YOU.
WONDERFUL FIRST DAY.
YOU WERE SO BRAVE,
SO VERY EXCITING.
        OH, THANKS VERY MUCH,
        NINA.
            ARE YOU GOING OUT
            FOR THE EVENING?
OH, NO. IT'S TOM'S
TURN TO COOK.
WE'RE HAVING VEGETARIAN STEAK
AND KICKY PUDDING.
I WOULDN'T MISS THAT
FOR THE WORLD.
I'M JUST OFF TO THE PHONE BOX.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
                WHO'S SHE OFF
                TO RING?
        HER HUSBAND.
WELL, BOSS.
ANOTHER DAY,
ANOTHER .00001
OF A DOLLAR.
HOW WAS IT FOR YOU?
                NOT WITHOUT
                ITS MOMENTS.
(IMITATING
TRUMPET FANFARE)
NOT BAD, EH?
JUST A BIT OF FUN.
            NO, NO, NO.
            IT WORKS VERY WELL.
            A LITTLE
            UNDERSTATED, I FEAR.
WELL, IT'S WORTH IT
JUST TO SEE HENRY'S FACE.
BY THE WAY, BOSS,
ARE YOU CONSIDERING
HAVING ANYONE COME
TO SEE THIS THING?
    FIRST THINGS FIRST.
    WE GOTTA GET THE SHOW RIGHT.
YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE TICKETS?
THE BOX OFFICE,
CASH ADVANCE, ADVERTISING.
    THAT'S ALL IN HAND.
    THEY LISTED UP A BOX OFFICE
        AT MOLLY'S SCHOOL,
        AND PEOPLE CAN BOOK
        THROUGH HER HOME NUMBER.
    FADGE HAS AGREED TO DO
    THE CATERING FRONT OF HOUSE.
HOW MANY HAVE BOOKED
SO FAR?
        WELL, FIGURES
        AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
    CAN BE A LITTLE MISLEADING--
    CHRISTMAS SHOPPING, ETC.
HAS ANYONE BOOKED?
    WE'RE LOOKING AT BUSINESS
    MAINLY ON THE NIGHT.
NO ONE'S BOOKING.
                    NOT YET. NO.
I'VE GOT A LITTLE CASH FLOW
PROBLEM WITH THE LANDLORD.
        OH, NO, JIM, NOT AGAIN.
        YOU PROMISED.
YEAH. I'M JUST
A BIT STUCK.
    UNSTICK YOURSELF, DARLING.
    CAN'T YOU REASON WITH HIM?
I DON'T THINK SO.
HE'S GOT SOME VERY STRONG
AND VERY PERSUASIVE FRIENDS
IN THE BUILDING TRADE.
            YOU'LL THINK
            OF SOMETHING.
            HOW'S YOUR HAMLET?
A LITTLE UNDERDONE
AT THE MOMENT.
MOLLY'S MAINLY
FILLING IN FOR ME,
AND SHE'S RATHER GOOD,
TOO, THE BITCH.
            DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
            YOURSELF, DARLING.
    I DON'T WANT TO DRAG
    RELUCTANT CASTING DIRECTORS
        DOWN THERE
        AND SEE YOU BEING BAD.
NO, NO, UNDERSTOOD.
    AND, DARLING, MORE DRAMAS
    ON THE DYLAN JUDD FRONT.
        APPARENTLY,
        SHE WANTS BILLING
        AND A PERSONAL TRAINER.
        CONTRACT'S NOT SIGNED,
        FILMING IMMINENT.
        SHE IS PUSHING HER LUCK.
I DO WISH HIM WELL.
        I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.
            ARE YOU FEELING LESS
            SUICIDAL NOW?
I SUPPOSE SO.
            THEN IT'S WORKING.
            MARVELOUS.
            GOOD NIGHT,
            SWEET PRINCE.
GOOD NIGHT.
AND LET HIM
PLAY HIS MUSIC!
                WELL, MY LORD.
FAREWELL!
        Joe: WHAT WAS THAT?
        LISTEN, IT'S--IT'S--
        IT'S A BIT, UM...
    MUCH?
            YEAH. I MEAN,
        I DON'T KNOW IF THE NOSE
        IS GOING TO YOUR HEAD,
        IF YOU PARDON
        THE EXPRESSION,
        BUT I'M GETTING MORE
        SHYLOCK THAN POLONIUS.
WELL, I LIKE
TO BE BOLD EARLY ON,
BUT I GET
THE MESSAGE, CHIEF.
BASICALLY,
IT'S, UH, L.C.A.
                HMM?
LESS CRAP ACTING.
    AH. THAT'S ABOUT
    THE SIZE OF IT. THANK YOU.
    TOM.
                YES, DARLING.
YOUR ACCENT--
                YOU NOTICED IT?
YEAH. I THINK YOU HAVE
TO COME FROM PLUTO
NOT TO NOTICE IT.
                    GOOD, GOOD.
YEAH. UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK
YOU HAVE TO COME FROM PLUTO
TO UNDERSTAND IT.
            WELL, IT HAS TO BE
            DIFFERENT, DARLING.
            I MEAN, I AM PLAYING
            A LOT OF ROLES,
            HOWEVER SMALL SOME
            OF THEM ARE NOW.
            I WANT EACH ONE
            TO BE DISTINCT.
            NOW, I'VE TAKEN MY
            CUE FROM HIS NAME--
            REYNALDO.
            YOU KNOW, REYNARD.
            SORT OF FOXY.
            HENCE, THE ACCENT.
A FOXY ACCENT?
            WELL, YOU SEE,
            I ASKED MYSELF,
            "HOW WOULD
            A FOX SPEAK?"
            RATHER COVERT,
            RATHER SECRETIVE.
I'M GETTING MORE RUSSIAN
THAN SECRETIVE OR FOXY.
            YEAH. LET ME
            WORK ON IT, YEAH?
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
                OK. HERE WE GO.
JOE. UH, UM, JUST BEFORE
WE DO MY ENTRANCE,
I WONDERED IF I COULD
TRY SOMETHING.
        YES. CERTAINLY, NINA.
        WHAT?
UM, WELL,
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
BEARING IN MIND
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING
TO CARNFORTH
THE OTHER DAY, YOU KNOW,
ABOUT FEAR
AND EVERYTHING,
AND I WAS SORT
OF THINKING, UM,
F-FOR THIS SCENE,
SHE REALLY OUGHT TO BE, UM...
GENUINELY SCARED TO BITS?
                EXACTLY. GOOD.
I MEAN, ALMOST VIOLENT.
HYSTERICAL.
                    RIGHT. YEAH.
JUST PREPARING
THE AUDIENCE SLIGHTLY
FOR LATER ON
WHEN SHE GOES MAD,
AND JUST SO THAT
WE CAN REALLY SEE
THE EFFECT THAT HAMLET
HAS ON HER, YOU KNOW,
AND THE EFFECT
OF SEEING HIS FLESH.
THE SEXUAL THREAT,
YOU KNOW?
UM, JUST SORT OF VERY MUCH
OUT OF CONTROL ALMOST.
            EXCELLENT. RIGHT.
            YOU TRY IT.
ALL RIGHT. OK.
            OK, HERE WE GO,
            THEN.
            IN YOUR OWN TIME.
GOOD-BYE, THEE.
FARE YE WELL.
                GOOD MY LORD.
AND LET HIM
PLAY HIS MUSIC.
                WELL, MY LORD.
FAREWELL.
    (SHRILL SHRIEKING)
    OH, MY LORD!
    I'VE BEEN SO AFFRIGHTED!
            OH! OH!
    OH! (CRASH)
        IF THAT GIRL MAKES IT
        TO THE FIRST NIGHT
        WITHOUT SERIOUS
        ACCIDENT,
        I'LL BE AMAZED.
OH. SHE DOES
SEEM TO HAVE
A BIT OF A VISION PROBLEM,
DOESN'T SHE?
        SHE'S BRUSHED
        HER TEETH WITH SOAP
        FOR THE LAST 3 NIGHTS,
        BUT SHE WON'T ADMIT IT.
YEAH. SHE'S A STUBBORN
OLD THING, ISN'T SHE,
UNDERNEATH
ALL THAT DIZZY STUFF?
            OH! OH!
                    BUT NICE.
                    VERY NICE.
                OH, BUGGERING
                BUGGERY BUGGER!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
            NO. IT'S THESE
            BLOODY COSTUMES.
            I BROUGHT EVERY
            PERIOD WITH ME,
            BUT I CAN'T QUITE
            DECIDE
            AND IT'S GETTING
            A BIT--
LATE IN THE DAY?
            DON'T SAY THAT,
            FOR GOD'S SAKE.
        YOU'RE VERY IMPRESSIVE
        WITH THAT CROSSWORD.
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THE SECRET IS...
I DON'T ANSWER
ANY OF THE CLUES.
            WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, I JUST...
TAKE MY TIME,
FILL IN ALL
THE EMPTY BOXES.
ANY OLD LETTERS WILL DO.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN TERRIBLE
AT THE BLOODY THINGS,
BUT IT TAKES MY MIND
OFF THE GODAWFUL
BUSINESS OF ACTING.
            IS YOUR NAME REALLY
            CARNFORTH GREVILLE?
NO. IT'S KEITH BRANCH.
I JUST PINCHED ONE
THAT I THOUGHT HAD THE...
REQUISITE AMOUNT
OF MYSTERY AND GLAMOUR.
                WHAT DO YOUR
                PARENTS THINK?
THEY WERE RATHER
DISAPPOINTED, ACTUALLY.
WELL, THEY'D DONE
A LOT OF SCRIMPING
TO PUT ME THROUGH
THE DRAMA SCHOOL,
AND, WELL, UM, WELL, THEY--
THEY REALLY BELIEVED IN ME...
MOM, ESPECIALLY.
I DON'T THINK I'VE DEALT
WITH PARENTAL EXPECTATION
TERRIBLY WELL.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WERE YOU CHRISTENED FADGE?
        HARDLY. I WAS CHRISTENED
        MILDRED.
        NOT THE NAME TO HAVE
        IF YOU SEEK DISTINCTION
        AS A DESIGNER,
        WHICH I RATHER
        PITIFULLY DID...
        BUT I WAS ADOPTED,
        YOU SEE,
        SO, I DIDN'T THINK
        IT REALLY MATTERED.
I THINK
IT'S RATHER SWEET.
            THANK YOU, KEITH.
MY PLEASURE, MILDRED.
    'TIS RATHER FUN, ALL THIS,
    SOMETIMES, ISN'T IT?
MMM. 'TIS RATHER.
OH! I'VE JUST GOT
ANOTHER CLUE.
    SO, WHY NO GLASSES, EH?
    OR--I DON'T KNOW.
            I DON'T KNOW,
            EITHER.
            I DON'T WANT
            TO SEE THE WORLD
            IN SHARP FOCUS.
WHY?
        BECAUSE IT'S HORRIBLE.
YOU REALLY THINK SO?
YOU WERE ALWAYS SO AMAZINGLY
POSITIVE AND BRIGHT.
                    AND DIZZY.
NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
    IT'S WHAT MY DAD SAYS
    ON THE PHONE EVERY NIGHT.
    HE THINKS THIS WHOLE THING
    OF BEING AN ACTRESS
    AND WORKING IN THE THEATER
    IS JUST
    A TERRIBLE PASSING PHASE.
I'M SURE HE'S VERY PROUD,
REALLY.
        I HOPED HE WOULD BE
        IF HE CAME TO SEE IT.
        IT WAS MY FIRST
        PROPER PART.
STILL...
I EXPECT YOUR HUSBAND
GIVES YOU HIS SUPPORT.
                YEAH. HE DOES,
                IN HIS WAY.
I'M SORRY? WELL,
DOES HE LIVE VERY FAR AWAY?
            HE'S DEAD.
            IT'S ALL RIGHT.
            JUST ONE
            OF THOSE THINGS.
        ONE OF THOSE GHASTLY,
        BLOODY AWFUL THINGS.
WAS HE ILL?
            NO. IT'S MUCH
            MORE STUPID
            AND ABSURD
            THAN THAT.
        HE WAS A FIGHTER PILOT.
        REALLY.
        A GREAT DANCER
        AND A VERY GOOD
        FIGHTER PILOT,
        BUT HE CRASHED.
        A MID-AIR COLLISION
        AT TREMENDOUS SPEED.
        A ONE-IN-A-MILLION
        CHANCE
        IN THE LAKE DISTRICT.
        IT WAS
        A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
        BUT THEN,
        I SUPPOSE IT USUALLY IS.
        NOT THAT THAT MAKES IT
        ANY EASIER.
HOW OLD WAS HE?
        33. CHRIST DIED AT 33...
        RATHER MORE PAINFULLY,
        I SUPPOSE.
WHAT DID YOU DO
WHEN IT HAPPENED?
            WENT TO PIECES.
            THE USUAL.
            THEN AFTER A WHILE,
            YOU START
            TO PUT YOUR LIFE
            BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.
            MARTIN ALWAYS
            USED TO SAY THAT.
            LIFE'S A SILLY
            OLD BUSINESS.
            YOU FALL DOWN,
            YOU GET UP,
            YOU FALL DOWN,
            YOU GET UP--
            LITERALLY,
            IN MY CASE.
HAD YOU ALWAYS BEEN
IN THE THEATER?
            OH, NO. I WAS
            IN THE SERVICES.
            SERVICE FAMILY.
            R.A.F., OF COURSE.
            THEATER'S ALL
            A LOT OF NONSENSE.
            SPARE-TIME STUFF
            IF YOU HAD TO.
            MARTIN WAS
            DIFFERENT, THOUGH.
            HE ALWAYS BELIEVED
            I COULD BE
            A GROWNUP ACTRESS.
I THINK YOU'RE
A VERY GROWNUP ACTRESS.
        O, MY OFFENSE IS RANK.
            CAN YOU REHEARSE
            ON SOMETHING HARDER?
    SO FULL OF ARTLESS
    JEALOUSY IS GUILT.
IT SPILLS ITSELF
IN FEELING TO BE SPLEAT...
IN SLEEVING TO BE FEET.
IF--OH, GOD. IF I DON'T GET
THROUGH THAT SENTENCE AGAIN
I'LL LOSE A FILLING.
        DIE! DIE!
                UNH! AHH! OH!
    DIE! DIE!
        AH! EH! OH!
        (GROANING OUTRAGEOUSLY)
AH. AH. AH.
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE IT?
I MEAN, WHEN I STAGGER OUT
DRAMATICALLY
FROM BEHIND THE ARRAS?
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE
WITH HAMLET AT THIS STAGE.
HE HARDLY KNOWS
HIS ARRAS FROM HIS ELBOW.
        Both: HO HO.
    GO, CAPTAIN...FROM
    THE GREAT DANISH KING.
        TELL HIM...
        THAT BY HIS LICENSE,
        FORTINBRAS
        CRAVES THE CONVEYANCE
        OF A PROMISED MARCH
        OVER HIS KINGDOM.
        YOU KNOW THE RENDEZVOUS.
TOM, I JUST DON'T GET IT.
        NORWEGIAN, DARLING.
        NORWEGIAN.
        ALL THOSE FIELDS AND
        LITTLE MOUNT HERRINGS.
        THEY WALK DIFFERENTLY,
        THEY TALK DIFFERENTLY.
THEY DO COME
FROM PLANET EARTH.
                THIS ISN'T EASY,
                JOE.
        ¶ AND GUILDENSTERN,
        AND GUILDENSTERN ¶
        ¶ AND ROSENCRANTZ,
        AND ROSENCRANTZ ¶
        ¶ MY HONORED LORD,
        MY MOST DEAR LORD ¶
        ¶ MY HONORED LORD ¶
WHAT HAVE I DONE?
    Joe: WELL, THAT WAS
    AN EXTRAORDINARY FIRST WEEK.
    NO ONE SAID
    IT WOULD BE EASY.
    IT'S A BIG PLAY, AND WE'VE
    COVERED EVERY SCENE...
IN SHIT.
    AND THAT IN ITSELF
    IS A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT.
    NOW, I THINK WE HAVE
    TO WORRY A LITTLE LESS
    ABOUT THE EXTERIOR
    OF THESE CHARACTERS...
    THE CLOTHES, WALKS,
    AND ACCENTS, ET CETERA,
    AND CONCENTRATE
    A LITTLE MORE
    ON EACH INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS,
    THEIR DRIVES.
    WHAT IS IT
    THEY WANT AND NEED...
    WHY THEY DO WHAT THEY DO,
    NOT HOW.
    THE HOW
    WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF
    IF WE ASK ALWAYS,
    "WHY, WHY, WHY?"
BELIEVE ME, DARLING,
I'VE BEEN ASKING.
    NOW, IF WE CAN USE
    THAT ENERGY, THAT HUNGER,
    THE VERY HUNGER
    THAT HAS BROUGHT US HERE
    FOR THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY,
    I THINK YOU'LL FIND
    THAT THE PLAY
    WILL GIVE YOU BACK
    A GREAT DEAL.
    YOU HAVE
    TO TRUST YOURSELVES.
    WE HAVE TO TRUST OURSELVES.
    YOU HAVE A GREAT DEAL
    TO OFFER...
    BOTH TO EACH OTHER
    AND TO THE AUDIENCES,
    AND DO REMEMBER, PLEASE,
    IT IS ONLY THE END
    OF THE FIRST WEEK.
YES. THE PROBLEM IS, LOVE,
THERE IS NO SECOND WEEK.
WE HAVE 4 MORE DAYS BEFORE
THE TECHNICAL REHEARSAL,
ONE DRESS REHEARSAL
ON CHRISTMAS EVE AFTERNOON,
AND ON IN THE EVENING.
        YES. WE'VE SET OURSELVES
        A CHALLENGE.
        THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT,
        BUT AT SHAKESPEARE'S
        OWN THEATER...
        A 6-WEEK SEASON
        WOULD HAVE PRODUCED
        35 PERFORMANCES
        OF 17 DIFFERENT PLAYS,
        INCLUDING AT TIMES
        4 WORLD PREMIERES.
        SO, AS POLONIUS SAYS,
        "SOMETIMES BREVITY CAN
        BE THE SOUL OF WIT."
        I DON'T THINK WE OUGHT
        TO LOSE OUR NERVE.
BLOODY DIFFICULT, ISN'T IT,
OLD SALLY SHAKESPEARE?
ESPECIALLY
FOR US NEW GIRLS.
            JOIN THE CLUB, LOVE.
OH, BUT YOU'VE
DONE IT BEFORE.
            NEVER.
            JUST SEEMS THAT WAY.
OH, YOU MINX.
YOU'RE FULL OF SURPRISES.
        I KNOW, LOVE.
        JUST AN OLD BULLSHITTER.
        ALWAYS WANTED TO DO
        THE CLASSICS, OF COURSE.
        USED TO READ ABOUT
        THE OLD SHAKESPEARE
        COMPANIES, YOU KNOW?
        8 PLAYS IN 6 DAYS.
MMM.
        TRAVELING FROM TOWN
        TO TOWN ON A SUNDAY.
        HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
        WAVING THE ACTORS OFF
        FROM THE PLATFORM.
            SO ROMANTIC.
        UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS
        BORN OUT OF MY TIME.
        WHEN I JOINED
        THE BUSINESS,
        ALL THAT WAS GONE.
        IT WAS DIVIDED IN 2.
        THERE WAS
        THE PROPER THEATER--
        YOU KNOW, STRATFORD
        AND ALL THAT,
        THEN THERE
        WAS COMMERCIAL STUFF.
        WELL, A LITTLE
        SUBURBAN BOY LIKE ME
        HAD NO CHANCE
        OF THE TIGHTS
        AND FLUFFY WHITE SHIRTS.
        I WAS STRAIGHT INTO
        UNDERSTUDYING OLD MEN
        AND "ANYONE FOR TENNIS."
SO, YOU HAVEN'T REALLY
DONE ANY SHAKESPEARE?
                        NO.
MUST BE A BIT NERVOUS.
        TOTAL BROWN TROUSER JOB,
        LOVE.
        YOU CAN'T SHOW THE YOUNG
        ONES YOUR FEAR,
        SO YOU COVER UP BY BEING
        A CRAPPY OLD GIT.
WELL, YOU'RE
VERY CONVINCING.
        MMM. WELL, WE ALL HAVE
        OUR CROSSES TO BEAR.
        MIND YOU, YOU KNOW,
        I DO FEEL AS THOUGH
        I'VE DONE IT BEFORE,
        THE CLASSICS...
        THROUGH PEOPLE
        LIKE IRVING AND KEAN.
I ADORE IRVING.
            YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM?
DARLING, JUST 'CAUSE
I'M IN A FROCK
AT THE END OF THE PIER
DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T HAVE A GRASP
FOR THEATRICAL HISTORY,
YEAH?
            HE WAS AMAZING,
            WASN'T HE?
YEAH.
            OIK, JUST LIKE ME.
        A STAMMER, A LIMP,
        EVERY DISADVANTAGE...
        AND YET,
        THE FIRST ACTOR
        EVER TO BE KNIGHTED.
AND HE DIED
WITH HIS BOOTS ON.
            THAT'S RIGHT.
            IN HARNESS...
            ON TOUR IN BRADFORD.
            WHAT A WAY TO GO.
            MIND YOU, I'VE
            DIED IN BRADFORD
            A FEW TIMES.
        OH, GOD. GOD,
        HOW WEARY, STALE, FLAT,
        AND UNPROFITABLE
        SEEM TO ME
        ALL THE USES
        OF THIS WORLD.
THAT'S NOT BAD,
SIR LAURENCE.
        WELL, I UNDERSTAND
        HOW HE FEELS, VIVIEN.
        OH, CHRIST. WHAT ARE WE
        GONNA DO? I MEAN,
        THIS WAS ALL
        SO CAREFULLY WORKED OUT.
        I MEAN, BASED ON,
        AND LET'S FACE IT,
        AN OPTIMISTIC TURNOUT
        OF 300 PEOPLE A NIGHT
        FOR 7 PERFORMANCES,
        MAKING AN AVERAGE
        DONATION--
        WELL, WE CAN'T CHARGE
        PROPER TICKET PRICES.
        THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S
        ABOUT. ANYWAY, LOOK,
        MAKING AN AVERAGE
        DONATION OF £2.50,
        THAT'S £750 PER NIGHT,
        WHICH MAKES IT 5,250
        FOR THE RUN, LESS £2,100
        FOR PRODUCTION BUDGET
        AND RENT,
        THAT'S £100 PER WEEK,
        PER PERSON
        PROFIT SHARE, HOPEFULLY,
        FOR 3 WEEKS FOR 8 PEOPLE
        LESS £150 FOR
        FIRST-NIGHT DRINKS
        AND CHRISTMAS DINNER,
        LESS £600
        FOR FOOD AND UTILITIES.
        ANYWAY, THAT BRINGS
        IT ALL BACK TO NOTHING,
        AND IT CERTAINLY
        DOESN'T MATCH UP
        £700 FOR PRODUCTION
        WEEK RENT...
        AND ANYWAY, THAT WAS
        BASED ON AN IDEA
        OF BOX OFFICE
        ADVANCE CASH SUPPLY
        FROM WHICH
        I COULD BORROW MONEY
        INSTEAD
        OF MY CREDIT CARD,
        WHICH IS NOW KAPUT.
    SPATCH TO THE RESCUE,
    CHIEF.
    FADGE DID THE BOARD,
    I RAN OFF THE FLYERS
    ON MY COMPUTER.
    I'M GONNA TRAIL
    THE STREETS OF HOPE.
    YOU GIVE ME THE TICKETS,
    I'LL SELL SOME LIVE.
                OH, THAT'S
                FANTASTIC!
    I ALSO HAVE A BOOKING
    AT CHELFORD CASTLE.
                WHAT, THE RUIN?
        PART RUIN,
        PART COUNTRY HOTEL.
AFTER YOUR TIME, LOVE.
THE BEGINNING
OF THE ATTEMPTED
YUPPIFICATION
OF THE AREA.
A SMOOTH BLEND
OF ANCIENT MONUMENT,
AND LEISURE FACILITY.
DIDN'T WORK.
    OH, BUT THE HOTEL DOES,
    FOR CHRISTMAS, ANYWAY.
    IT'S FULLY BOOKED,
    AND THEY ARE ABOUT TO GET
    MY OCCASIONAL CABARET ACT
    OF CROONING AND CONJURING.
            MIGHT SELL SOME
            TICKETS FOR<i> HAMLET.</i>
    OR MY MIDDLE NAME
    ISN'T FABULOUSLY TALENTED
    AND MODEST.
            OH, VERNON,
            I LOVE YOU.
            IN A PLATONIC WAY,
            OBVIOUSLY.
OBVIOUSLY.
        BUT THEN, YOU DO HAVE
        A LOVELY ASS.
        THIS IS THE VERY COINAGE
        OF YOUR BRAIN,
        THIS BODILESS CREATION
        ECSTASY
        IS VERY CUNNING IN.
ECSTASY! MY PULSE, AS YOURS,
DOTH TEMPERATELY KEEP TIME
AND MAKES
AS HEALTHFUL MUSIC.
IT IS NOT MADNESS
THAT I HAVE UTTERED,
MOTHER, FOR LOVE OF GRACE,
LAY NOT THAT FLATTERING
UNCTION TO YOUR SOUL
THAT NOT YOUR TRESPASS
BUT MY MADNESS SPEAKS.
IT WILL BUT SKIN AND FILM
THE ULCEROUS PLACE
WHILST RANK CORRUPTION MINING
ALL WITHIN INFECTS UNSEEN.
CONFESS YOURSELF TO HEAVEN!
REPENT WHAT'S PAST!
AVOID WHAT IS TO COME!
        OH, HAMLET, THOU HAST
        CLEFT MY HEART IN TWAIN!
            I'M SORRY, JOE.
            I CAN'T GO ON.
NO! IT'S TERRIFIC,
IT'S TERRIFIC.
YOU MUST--YOU MUST
(BLATHERS)
YOU'RE JUST AVOIDING
CONFRONTING AS AN ACTOR,
THAT'S ALL--THAT'S ALL.
LOOK, YOU HAVE
TO FEEL HER GUILT.
YOU HAVE TO CONFESS
TO YOUR SON.
            I TRIED. I TRIED.
            HE WOULDN'T LISTEN.
            JOE. JOE.
Joe: WHAT?
    A BIT CLOSE TO HOME, LOVE.
                    WHEN?
WHEN I WAS 17.
THE ONLY TIME
I'VE BEEN WITH A GIRL,
BEFORE OR SINCE.
                    JUST ONCE?
I KNOW. BULL'S-EYE.
THIS GIRL WASN'T
FIRING BLANKS.
                WHAT DID YOU DO?
WELL, I WAS
ALREADY HALFWAY
TO RUNNING OFF
TO THE CIRCUS,
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.
SHE WAS DETERMINED
TO HAVE THE KID.
NOT THAT I'D HAVE KNOWN
WHAT TO HAVE DONE
EVEN IF SHE HADN'T BEEN.
ONCE SHE FOUND OUT THAT
I KICKED WITH THE OTHER FOOT,
SHE'D HAVE HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME ANYWAY.
                DO YOU KNOW
                WHERE THEY ARE?
THEY'RE WITH FAMILY, LOVE.
KIDS, TOO.
THEY GET A BEE
IN THEIR BONNET...
OR TURN INTO
SHERLOCK HOLMES
WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR
REAL MUMMY AND DADDY.
CHRISTMAS EVE.
BRADFORD, AS IT HAPPENS.
<i> PUSS IN BOOTS.</i>
 4 YEARS AGO.
                WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, IT WAS A BIT LIKE
THAT LAST SCENE WE JUST DID...
NOT QUITE
SUCH A GOOD SCRIPT.
I'D ABANDONED HIM
AND HIS MOTHER,
WHO HE HATES
FOR HIDING ME.
HE WAS ASHAMED OF MY JOB,
OF WHAT I WAS...
    AM...
NEVER WANTED
TO SEE ME AGAIN.
NO SURPRISES.
            HE MUST HAVE BEEN
            VERY UPSET.
SO WAS I.
        HAVE YOU SEEN HIM SINCE?
OH, I'VE WRITTEN TO HIM.
I GET THE OCCASIONAL CARD.
THE THING IS, HENRY,
THIS PLAY BRINGS IT BACK
MORE THAN I'D HAVE
THOUGHT POSSIBLE.
SHAKESPEARE WASN'T STUPID.
FAMILIES, YOU KNOW,
THEY DON'T WORK,
DO THEY?
        I DON'T KNOW, LOVE.
        NEVER HAD ONE.
        ALWAYS FANCIED ONE,
        BUT NEVER WORKED OUT.
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO GO ON.
                YES, YOU WILL.
                WE BOTH WILL.
    Tom: THOUGHT
    AND AFFLICTIONS.
    PASSION. HELL ITSELF.
    SHE TURNS TO--
HAS ANYONE SEEN
A BOTTLE OF LEMONADE?
I BELIEVE I'VE GOT
A BIT OF A SORE THROAT.
                    LEMONADE?
YES, LEMONADE.
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,
BUSTER?
    OK, OK, OK, OK.
    LET'S GO AGAIN
    FROM OPHELIA'S SONG,
    AND PLEASE, PLEASE,
    GIVE THIS SCENE
    THE INTENSITY IT DESERVES.
    YOU'RE ALL SHYING AWAY
    FROM THE POWER OF THIS PLAY.
                    SORRY, JOE.
NOW, THIS SCENE
IS ABOUT LOSS.
THE LOSS OF SENSE.
OPHELIA'S MADNESS.
THE LOSS OF A SISTER.
THE LOSS
OF A RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN GERTRUDE
AND CLAUDIUS,
AND CRUCIALLY, THE LOSS,
AND THE DEATH OF SOMEONE
YOU HAVE ALL,
IN YOUR OWN WAYS,
EXPERIENCED
A PROFOUND LOVE FOR.
NOW THAT'S A HUMAN EMOTION
WE CAN ALL SHARE.
THAT'S WHERE WE CONNECT
WITH THE AUDIENCE,
IN HOPE OR WHEREVER.
WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU
HAVE SUFFERED SUCH A LOSS.
OH. OH, SH--
I'M SORRY, NINA.
            NO, YOU'RE PERFECTLY
            RIGHT, JOE.
            WE MUST IMAGINE
            THE REALITY OF IT.
            I'M FINE.
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO AGAIN
FROM THAT POINT.
        ¶ AND WILL HE
        NOT COME AGAIN ¶
        ¶ AND WILL HE
        NOT COME AGAIN ¶
        ¶ NO, NO, HE IS DEAD ¶
        ¶ GO TO THY DEATHBED ¶
        ¶ HE NEVER
        WILL COME AGAIN ¶
        (CRYING) I'M SORRY.
    DO YOU SEE THIS,
    O GOD?
        (OWL HOOTS)
        Margaretta: DARLING,
        IF I START NOW,
        IT'LL JUST BE
        AN OPEN DRAIN.
        YOU MADE RIDICULOUSLY
        OPTIMISTIC CALCULATIONS
        BASED ON AN INCOME THAT
        SIMPLY DOESN'T EXIST.
IT WILL.
    WELL, WHEN IT DOES, THEN
    I'LL FORWARD YOU SOME CASH.
HAVE YOU ANYTHING
EXCITING TO TELL ME?
    WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
    DYLAN'S BLOWN IT, DARLING.
    THEY START SHOOTING
    IN L.A. ON BOXING DAY,
    AND SHE HASN'T EVEN HAD
    A COSTUME FITTING YET.
    THE PRODUCER, NANCY CRAWFORD
    HERSELF, NO LESS,
    IS IN TOWN
    RECCING FOREIGN LOCATIONS.
    SHE IS GOING MAD.
COULDN'T YOU JUST GET ME
A WEEK OF THOSE EXPENSES?
        DARLING, YOU'RE
        UNDER TOO MUCH PRESSURE.
        WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
        SUNDAY OFF AND RELAX?
        REMEMBER,
        IT'S CHRISTMAS.
        YOU COULD WRITE
        TO SANTA.
            (HANGS UP)
            (DIAL TONE)
    Joe: LET'S START AGAIN NOW.
GO, CAPTAIN. FROM ME
GREET THE DANISH KING.
(BELCHES) TELL IT--
SORRY. SORRY.
GOT NERVOUS, DARLING.
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE!
I'M PLAYING 400 PARTS,
YOU WON'T ALLOW ME
TO DO A SINGLE ACCENT,
AND I'VE GOT A CAPTAIN HERE WHO
CAN'T WALK IN A STRAIGHT LINE.
                NOW, STEADY ON.
NOW, IF YOU COULD ONLY DO THAT,
LOVE, WE'D BE FINE!
JOE, I AM COMMITTED TO THIS
PROJECT 132%. YOU KNOW THAT.
EVERYTHING THAT I AM
AS A HUMAN BEING IS HERE.
I BRING IT IN EVERY MORNING.
IT'S YOURS.
MY ENERGY IS
ALWAYS POSITIVE ENERGY,
PHYSICALLY, INTELLECTUALLY,
AND...THING ME,
BUT ALL I EVER GET BACK
FROM PEOPLE IS RIDICULE.
LET'S ALL HAVE A CHEAP JOKE
AT TOM'S EXPENSE.
WELL, THAT'S FINE,
YOU KNOW. THAT REALLY IS,
REALLY PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT,
BECAUSE MY SHOULDERS ARE BROAD.
I, UM, I-I-I'VE KEPT
MY OWN PEACE,
AND I HAVEN'T GONE
TO MY AGENT.
                HE HASN'T
                GOT AN AGENT.
    YES, I HAVE! SHUT UP!
    SHUT UP, WILL YOU?
    YOU SEE,
    IT REALLY ISN'T FAIR.
    IT'S JUST--
    IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.
OK. I'M SORRY, TOM.
VERY SORRY.
        (INHALES AND EXHALES)
        I'M SORRY, TOO, JOE.
        SORRY, EVERYONE.
                IT'S FINE.
    NO, NO, NO. PLEASE.
START AGAIN.
YOU KNOW,
I LOVE THIS MAN.
(CLEARS THROAT)
    GO, CAPTAIN. FROM ME--
    (VIDEO CAMERA MOTOR
        WHIRRING)
    YOU SEE? IT'S HOPELESS.
    ABSOLUTELY HOPELESS.
    EVERYTHING WE DO
    FROM WIPING OUR ASS
    TO FLUFFING OUR LINES
    HAS TO BE ON CAMERA.
        CAN'T WE WORK
    IN PRIVATE FOR ONCE?
    WHY DOES EVERYONE
    HAVE TO SEE
    BEHIND-THE-SCENES
    THESE DAYS?
    I MEAN, WHATEVER HAPPENED
    TO ALL THE BLOODY MYSTERY?
I AM RECORDING
OUR HISTORY, LOVE.
IT WAS DISCUSSED.
RIGHT, JOE?
AND I THINK IT'S
THE LEAST I DESERVE.
I AM THE ONLY PERSON
WHO'S GONE OFF HIS ASS
TO SELL THIS SHOW.
                ALWAYS VULGAR.
DO YOU WANT ANYONE TO SEE
THIS, OR WOULD YOU RATHER--
WOULD YOU RATHER DO YOUR
BLOODY STUPID ACCENTS
IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR?
    ALL RIGHT! THAT'S IT!
    THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT!
    THAT IS IT! THAT IS IT!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
        I MEAN THE PLAY'S OVER.
        <i> FINITO,</i> WALK AWAY,
        END OF STORY,
        KAPUT, CHEERIO.
            YOU DON'T
            REALLY MEAN THAT.
    WELL, WHAT'S THE POINT,
    YOU KNOW?
    WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT?
    LOOK, YOU'RE A PERFECTLY
    DECENT BUNCH OF PEOPLE.
    YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
    A GROUP OF ACTORS
    WITH ALL THE NORMAL
    INSECURITIES AND VANITIES,
    BUT BASICALLY, YOU KNOW,
    I KNOW YOU WANT TO BE HERE.
    I KNOW WE ALL WANT TO DO
    WHAT'S BEST FOR THE PLAY,
    BUT LOOK AT US. I MEAN,
    WE ARGUE, WE'RE DEPRESSED.
    I MEAN, WE'VE SET OURSELVES
    TOO BIG A TARGET.
    YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL
    TOO PERSONAL FOR US ALL.
    IT'S A BIG PLAY, WE KEEP
    RUNNING UP AGAINST IT,
    AND WE'RE HURTING OURSELVES,
    AND I, FOR ONE,
    NO LONGER KNOW WHAT I'M
    DOING OR WHY I'M DOING IT.
    I DON'T KNOW THIS.
                THAT'S NOT TRUE.
        THE MISERABLE FACTS ARE,
        WE'VE RUN OUT OF TIME
        TO REHEARSE THIS,
        WE HAVE NO AUDIENCE,
        WE HAVE NO DESIGN.
        I'M SORRY, FADGE,
        BUT, UM, THAT'S TRUE.
        AND BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
        THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT,
        WE DO NOT EVEN
        HAVE THIS VENUE
        FOR THE RUN OF THE SHOW!
    THIS WHOLE IDEA, AND,
    OH, GOD, I CAN SEE IT NOW.
    NO OFFENSE, MOLLY,
    BUT IT'S JUST POINTLESS.
    CHURCHES CLOSE AND
    THEATERS CLOSE EVERY WEEK
    BECAUSE, FINALLY,
    PEOPLE DON'T WANT THEM.
    THE HOPE<i> HAMLET</i> IS A LOSER,
    LED BY THE CHIEF LOSER,
        YOURS TRULY,
    AND, YOU KNOW, CIRCUMSTANCES
    JUST FORCE ME TO ASK MYSELF,
    I MEAN, NOT ONLY
    WHAT IS THE POINT
    IN CARRYING ON WITH
    THIS MEANINGLESS SHAMBLES,
    BUT AS THE YULETIDE SEASON
    TAKES US IN ITS GRIP,
    I ASK MYSELF, WHAT IS
    THE POINT IN GOING ON
    WITH THIS MISERABLE,
    TORMENTED LIFE?
    I MEAN, CAN ANYONE TELL ME?
        PLEASE. PLEASE.
    WHAT MAKES THIS FUCKING LIFE
        WORTH LIVING?
    I THINK YOU'RE JUST
    PROJECTING NEGATIVITY,
    AND I THINK IT'S
    REALLY UNFAIR ON FADGE.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, TOM.
            RACHMANINOFF.
                    WHAT?
            A BIT IN
            <i> BRIEF ENCOUNTER.</i>
            AND<i> BRIEF ENCOUNTER,</i>
           <i> ACTUALLY.</i>
            THAT MAKES LIFE
            WORTH LIVING.
            I'LL BUY YOU THE
            VIDEO FOR CHRISTMAS.
THINKING OF TIM
BEING HAPPY.
                    WHO'S TIM?
MY SON.
    OH, SHIT, DO WE ALL
    HAVE TO DO ONE?
                    OH, SHUT UP,
                    CARNFORTH.
    Carnforth: SORRY.
                LOOK, JOE,
            I MIGHT BE SPEAKING
            OUT OF TURN,
            BUT I FEEL--I THINK
            WE ALL FEEL THAT,
            WELL, SOME OF WHAT
            YOU SAY IS TRUE,
            BUT WE'VE COME
            SUCH A LONG WAY.
            IT'S CERTAINLY
            WORTH ONE MORE GO.
            WHY DON'T WE
            CALL IT A NIGHT
            AND HAVE ONE RUN
            OF THE PLAY
            TOMORROW MORNING.
HEAR, HEAR.
                    AT LEAST
                    DO THAT, EH?
                    JUST FOR US,
                    EH, BOSS?
                    (SNIFFS)
            WHAT IS IT, MOLL?
        YOU.
    YOU'RE MY BROTHER.
    YOU MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING.
    YOU MAKE MY LIFE
    WORTH LIVING.
    SO, THAT SAYS ENOUGH.
    (CRYING)
    ¶ WHY MUST THE SHOW GO ON? ¶

    (EXCITED APPLAUSE
    AND TALKING)
            THAT WAS TERRIFIC!
            IT'S REALLY STARTING
            TO COME OUT.
WASN'T IT AMAZING?
        IT WAS SO EXCITING.
        I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!
            I'M NEARLY THERE,
            JOE. I HAVEN'T
            QUITE HIT ON
            THE RIGHT ERA YET,
            BUT WE'LL HACK IT
            OUT DURING THE TECH,
            I CAN FEEL IT
            IN MY NIPS.
        JOE, DO YOU REALIZE
        HOW BLOODY GOOD YOU ARE?
BRILLIANT!
                YOU ARE
                SO BLOODY GOOD.
            YOU WERE FANTASTIC.
        ENOUGH ABOUT ME,
        DARLING.
        WHAT DID YOU THINK
        OF MY PERFORMANCE?
                    NO EMPATHY!
                HA HA HA!
    HERE. COME HERE.
    IT WAS JUST LIKE EVERYTHING
    I HAD HOPED WOULD START UP.
            OH, YOU!
WELL DONE!
I JUST WISH THAT YOU--
            JOE. JOE. BEFORE YOU
            SAY ANYTHING ELSE,
            WE'VE TALKED TO MOLL
            ABOUT THE FINANCIAL
            SITUATION,
            AND WE FEEL,
            THE COMPANY FEELS,
            THAT WE
            SHOULD HELP OUT,
            SO, ANYWAY, WE'VE
            HAD A WHIP-AROUND,
            AND EVERYONE'S PUT
            IN WHAT THEY CAN,
            WHICH, I'M AFRAID,
            ISN'T NEARLY
            ENOUGH, BUT, UM--
    FADGE HAS SOLD
    HER VAN.
NEVER MIND.
(LAUGHS)
                WHAT? YOU
                SOLD YOUR VAN?
    YES.
            BUT YOU KEEP
            EVERYTHING IN IT--
            YOUR LIGHTS
            AND YOUR COSTUMES
            AND PROPS AND--
THEY'LL HOLD ONTO IT
TILL THE NEW YEAR.
IF THE PLAY SUCCEEDS,
I'LL BUY IT BACK.
    (GIGGLES)
        OH, FOLKS, THANK YOU.
        DO YOU MEAN THIS IS--
    WE PAID IT IN
    THIS MORNING, JOE.
    THE SHOW CAN GO ON.
                        HOORAY!
        HA HA HA!
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, YOU KNOW?
I JUST--I'M--I'M--
            A TALENTLESS GIT?
OH, YES. CERTAINLY.
THANK YOU.
            (LAUGHTER)
            (SILENCE)
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OH, GOD, I'M LAUGHING,
AND I THINK I'M GONNA CRY.
        DON'T DO THAT.
        WE ALL HAVE JOBS TO DO.
        THE TECHNICAL REHEARSAL
        IS FIRST THING
        TOMORROW MORNING.
        NOW, FADGE HAS
        GOT HALF OF US
        ON LIGHTS AND SOUND
        AND BLACKING OUT
        THE WINDOWS,
        AND THE REST OF US
        ARE GOING INTO HOPE
        THIS AFTERNOON
        TO FIND OUR AUDIENCE.
    THAT'S FANTASTIC.
BUT FIRST,
A DRINK?
        OH, YES!
                    YES!
                AND SOME MUSIC.
        YAY!
                YAY!
        (GONG)
        Carnforth:
        WHO'S THERE?
        (GONG CLANGS)
            NO, NO, CARNFORTH.
            REMEMBER,
            AS WE DISCOVERED
            IN REHEARSALS.
    Carnforth: NO, NO.
    I MEAN, WHO'S THERE?
    I CAN'T SEE A THING.
                OH. SORRY,
                CARNFORTH.
                HEY, WELL DONE,
                THOUGH.
                I REALLY
                BELIEVED YOU
                THE SECOND TIME
                THERE.
                VERNON.
                    YES, LOVE?
            YEAH. HEY, A LITTLE
            MORE DEFINITE
            WITH THE GONG.
        IT REALLY SETS UP
        THE TONE OF THE PLAY.
        Vernon:
    WELL, IT WOULD HELP
    IF THERE WASN'T QUITE
    SO MUCH SMOKE BACK HERE.
    I KEEP WORRYING
    I'M GONNA BUMP
    INTO JACK THE RIPPER.
    HE'S GONNA THINK
I'M THE MAN FROM THE REN--
            WELL, CAN'T SOMEONE
            ELSE DO THE GONG?
    WELL, NINA'S BLIND
    ENOUGH AS IT IS
    WITHOUT HAVING TO BANG
    A GONG IN THE MIST.
    CARNFORTH'S ON,
    TOM'S ON IN A SECOND,
    AND YOU'RE OUT THERE.
                WHAT ABOUT HENRY
                OR TERRY?
            YOU LOOK WONDERFUL.
YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
                    (SNICKERS)
        (TALKING ON STAGE)
(CLEARS THROAT)
UM, FADGE.
    TEETHING PROBLEMS, DARLING.
    THAT'S WHY WE REHEARSE.
Joe: YEAH, SURE.
NO PROBLEM WITH THAT.
IT'S JUST THAT WE'VE SPENT
ALL MORNING ON THIS,
AND WE HAVEN'T GOT BEYOND
THE "WHO'S THERE?"
AND THAT'S A QUESTION
I FEAR MANY OF THE AUDIENCE
WILL BE ASKING
IF THE SMOKE'S THIS THICK.
        OPENING IMAGE, DARLING.
        TURN THIS OFF.
        TURN THIS OFF.
UNDERSTOOD.
ANY FINAL DECISIONS
ABOUT PROPS OR COSTUMES?
        I'VE GOT TILL THE END
        OF THE TECH, HAVEN'T I?
Joe: YES.
            LET'S REMAIN OPEN.
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
LET'S GO FROM THE LAST LINE
OF THE PREVIOUS SCENE.
READY TO
BRING ON THE THRONE.
TOM, GIVE US
YOUR LAST LINE.
YOU CAN SAY IT
FROM OFFSTAGE FOR NOW.
STAND BY, ELEC.
STAND BY, SOUND...
AND CUE TOM.
    Tom: LET'S DO IT, I PRAY,
    AND I THIS MORNING KNOW
    WHERE WE SHALL FIND HIM
        MOST CONVENIENT.
GO, ELECS.
GO, MUSIC.
        (MUSIC PLAYS)
THAT'S GOOD.
VERNON ON FIRST.
CHECK OUT THE AUDIENCE
AS IF IT'S
THE IMAGINARY CORD.
EXCELLENT.
VERY GOOD
TO HOLD HER HAND.
KEEP HER OUT OF TROUBLE.
THAT'S GOOD, AND...
NOW THE KING OF--
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
DARLING?
                    NOT BAD, EH?
                    (LAUGHS)
OK. JUST, UH,
LET'S JUST HOLD IT THERE.
UM, DO YOU KNOW,
I THINK THIS IS
NOT A BAD TIME
TO HAVE AN INFORMAL CHAT
ABOUT COSTUME AND MAKEUP.
UH, LET'S BREAK
FOR TEA THERE.
BACK IN AN HOUR.
UM, HENRY AND TERRY,
A LITTLE WORD IN YOUR EAR.
                WHAT'S WITH HIM?
DON'T KNOW, LOVE. IT'S
AS GOOD AS A FUCKING GUESS.
I DOUBT LIKELY
IT'S ABOUT ANYTHING.
FUCK ALL, DARLING.
                JOE. JOE.
                COULD YOU CALL
                YOUR AGENT?
I'LL BE RIGHT
WITH YOU.
            I JUST POPPED DOWN
            TO THE POST OFFICE,
            AND THE LANDLORD
            SAID THERE WAS
            A MESSAGE FOR YOU
            TO CALL YOUR AGENT.
THE LANDLORD
AT THE POST OFFICE?
            UH, YES, IT'S
            A TECHNICAL TERM.
            I BELIEVE IT CAME IN
            WITH PRIVATIZATION.
            ANYWAY, URGENT.
ALL RIGHT.
WAIT A MINUTE.
IT'S THE DAY BEFORE
CHRISTMAS EVE.
THERE ARE
NO AGENTS WORKING.
        OH, YES. THAT'S IT. CAN
        YOU CALL HER AT HOME?
        IS THERE A MESSAGE?
        BECAUSE I COULD ALWAYS--
I THINK YOU
SHOULD WORK ON
YOUR ROTATIONAL
MOVEMENT EXERCISES.
                    OK.
CARNFORTH, CARNFORTH.
DON'T DRINK.
YOU DON'T NEED TO.
AND 1, 2, 3...
¶ AND GUILDENSTERN,
MY HONORED LORD ¶
                SO, HOW MANY
                DOES THAT MAKE?
WELL, I'VE GOT
A PARTY OF 10 KIDS
FROM THE SCHOOL
COMING DOWN, £3 A HEAD.
MOST OF THEM HAVE A BLOODY
MISERABLE CHRISTMAS ANYWAY.
        WHAT, SO EVEN
        THIS OLD PILOT SAUCE
        IS BETTER THAN NOTHING?
NO!
            ONLY TEASING.
        I WON'T KNOW
        TILL TOMORROW NIGHT
        ABOUT THE CROWD
        FROM CHELFORD CASTLE.
            THEY'RE A BIT
            OVEREXCITED.
    WHY?
        THEY GOT
        THIS FILM COMPANY
        COMING TO DO
        A LOCATION RECCY THERE
        TOMORROW MORNING,
        VERY LAST MINUTE.
        BUT IF THEY USE
        THE CASTLE,
    THE HOTEL'S THE BEST PLACE
    TO BOOK THE CREW IN.
    QUIDS-IN FOR THE LANDLORD.
AT LAST.
                EXACTLY.
    SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT
    COMING TO SEE<i> HAMLET</i>
    IS A LOT LOWER
    ON HIS LIST OF PRIORITIES.
    WE COULD DO WITH
    HIS CROWD TOMORROW NIGHT,
        MIND YOU.
        IT'D SWELL THE COFFERS.
        ANYWAY, I'M STILL
        WORKING HIM OVER.
    HOW?
        WELL, THIS FILM'S
        FUTURISTIC, APPARENTLY.
        THEY'RE DOING THE
        INTERIORS IN AMERICA
        AND CHEAP LOCATIONS
        IN EUROPE.
        THEY WANT THE CASTLE
        TO BE THE RUINS
        OF AN ANCIENT CITY
        ON THE PLANET ZARBOC.
MMM. SOUNDS LOVELY.
        SO I TOLD HIM
        TO GREET THE PRODUCER
        IN AN R2-D2 PARTY HAT
        AND A HOMEMADE
        <i> STAR TREK</i> UNIFORM.
HE LOVES CRIMPLING.
            EXACTLY.
OH, FLIPPIN' HECK.
                COME ON.
OH, THANKS FOR DOING
ALL THIS, VERNON.
YOU'VE BEEN A ROCK.
THIS HAS BEEN THE WEIRDEST
CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY
FROM SCHOOL
I'VE EVER SPENT.
AND EVERY TIME I THINK
I'M GOING SLIGHTLY POTTY,
I JUST LOOK AT YOU.
I--I MEAN, I MEAN,
NOTHING SEEMS
TO PHASE YOU.
        WELL, IT DOESN'T
        IF YOU'RE NEEDED.
        I LIKE BEING NEEDED...
        A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME.
        I SHOULD MAKE
        A FILM ABOUT IT...
        <i> BEING NEEDED.</i>
CAN I BE IN IT?
        Margaretta: IT IS
        ASTONISHING, DARLING!
        ONLY NANCY CRAWFORD
        COULD AFFORD TO DO IT.
        OF COURSE IT MAKES SENSE
        IN THE LONG RUN,
        BUT IT'S TRUE.
        THEY WANT YOU
        FOR THE 3 PICTURES,
        GUARANTEED.
        GUARANTEED, JOE.
BUT WHAT IF--
        THEY HAVE
        TO PAY YOU, DARLING,
        EVEN IF THEY DON'T
        MAKE THE SECOND TWO.
        NOW, YOU'LL
        GET MORE UP FRONT,
        BUT NO BACK END,
        AND I'M GONNA FIGHT
        FOR A CUT
        OF THE MERCHANDISING.
        OF COURSE, WE CAN'T
        HOLD THEM TO RANSOM
        IF THE FIRST PICTURE'S
        A MONSTER HIT,
        BUT WE DO GET
        3 YEARS' MONEY
        AND 6 MONTHS A YEAR
        EMPLOYMENT GUARANTEED.
        AND A CONCEPT THAT
        COULD BE<i> STAR WARS</i>
        ALL OVER AGAIN.
AND YOU'RE CERTAIN
DYLAN JUDD IS OUT
OF THE PICTURE?
        DARLING, SHE HAS SHOT
        HERSELF IN THE FOOT,
        BOTTOM, AND, MOST
        CRUCIALLY, THE BRAIN.
        SO GREEDY.
        AND REMEMBER,
        THEY STILL HAVE
        THAT VIDEOTAPE
    OF YOUR AUDITION
    FROM ALL THOSE MONTHS AGO.
    THEY NEED CHARACTER
    FOR THESE SIDEKICK ROLES.
        PARTICULARLY, IF YOU'RE
        IN A SUIT OF LATEX
        FOR ALL THOSE HOURS.
I'M--I'M--I'M--
I'M SPEECHLESS!
OH, CHRIST, LOOK, MAGS,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO RUN.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT
WHEN YOU COME DOWN?
I'LL SEE YOU
FOR THE SHOW.
THANKS, MAGS!
            BUT, JOE!
        JOE, WE HAVE TO TALK.
        JOE, WE HAVE TO TALK!
        WE HAVE TO TALK
        ABOUT START DATES!
        SHIT! START DATES
        AND TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS!
            JOE, JOE!
PEACE OFFERING.
I THINK YOU'RE
BOTH FANTASTIC.
        NAUGHTY GIRL.
                BAD PERSON.
NOW, YOU TRUST ME
ON THIS MAKEUP ISSUE.
YOU LOOK GREAT.
HE'S RIGHT,
OF COURSE.
WE DID LOOK LIKE
2 SILLY OLD TARTS.
YOU CAN'T MAKE TIME
STAND STILL, HENRY.
THOSE DAYS
HAVE GONE FOREVER.
                I SUPPOSE SO.
                FUN THOUGH,
                WASN'T IT?
    OH, YES,
    IT WAS FUN.
Carnforth: WHAT'S
ALL THIS, THEN?
                A BRIBE
                FROM THE BOSS.
OH, THAT'S
VERY SPORTING OF HIM.
            YEAH. DO YOU THINK
            IT'S THE EQUIVALENT
            OF NERO FIDDLING
            WHILE ROME BURNED?
OH, HARDLY.
                ONLY JOKING,
                CARNFORTH.
                LIGHTEN UP.
    WELL...
I SUPPOSE I WOULD, LOVE,
IF I DIDN'T FEEL
SUCH AN 8 BILLION
PERCENT TWIT.
        OH, STILL
        HAVING A PROBLEM
        REMEMBERING THE LINES,
        ARE WE?
THE LINES, THE MOVEMENT,
THE COSTUME CHANGES...
MY BLOODY AWFUL ACTING.
    BETTY BOTTLE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
        I'M MAKING AN AUDIENCE.
I BEG YOUR PARDON.
    WELL, I'VE BEEN COMPLETELY
    PATHETIC UP TILL NOW,
    BUT I THINK I'M ON
    TO SOMETHING AT LAST.
    IF WE DON'T GET
    AN ACTUAL AUDIENCE,
    I WANT TO CREATE
    A WORLD FOR YOU.
    YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
    HAVE PEOPLE WATCHING YOU,
    EVEN IF THEY ARE CARDBOARD.
THAT'D BE BRILLIANT.
    THEY WON'T COUGH.
    I HATE THAT.
THAT CHAMPAGNE HAS GONE
RIGHT TO MY HEAD.
IS THIS WISE BEFORE
OUR FIRST NIGHT?
    THESE ARE UNUSUAL
    CIRCUMSTANCES.
            YES, IS YOUR BANK
            MANAGER DRUNK, TOO?
    I THINK HE WAS ENCOURAGED
    BY SOME CHRISTMAS GOOD NEWS
    TO REVIEW MY OVERDRAFT.
        OH, YOU MEAN SOMEONE'S
        BOUGHT A TICKET
        THAT WE DON'T KNOW, OR
        HE IS ACTUALLY DRUNK?
    ALL IN GOOD TIME. LET'S
    GET THE SHOW ON FIRST
    BEFORE WE SHARE
    THE GLAD TIDINGS.
            IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
            A LAUGH, ISN'T IT?
OH, YES.
            ON THE WHOLE, WE'VE
            GOT SERIOUS DISEASE.
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT WE
ARE BEING TREATED FOR IT.
WE DID TAKE THIS JOB.
    FADGE.
                    HMM?
    I THINK...
I COULD BE FUNNY
WITH YOU.
        YOU ARE FUNNY WITH ME.
        IN FACT, I THINK WE'RE
        FUNNY WITH EACH OTHER.
        COME ON. LET'S GET BACK
        TO BEING HUMORLESS
        AND INTENSE.
        WE'VE GOT
        AN AUDIENCE TO WRITE...
        AND REVIEWS TO MAKE.
            THE THOUGHT OF YOU,
            IT'S SO EASY.
            DRIVES ME MAD.
EASY? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN, EASY?
                I LOVE YOU.
    WHAT?
                I LOVE YOU.
NOW, VERNON, DON'T THINK
I'M NOT FLATTERED, IT'S--
        NO, NO. AS AN AUDIENCE
        MEMBER I LOVE YOU.
            AS A COMPANY MEMBER,
            I LOVE YOU.
            AS A HUMAN BEING,
            I LOVE YOU.
            I CAN'T HELP IT.
            YOU'VE GOT CHARM,
            WARMTH,
            YOU'RE ENDEARING.
            YOU'RE HONEST
            ABOUT YOURSELF,
            ABOUT YOUR FAULTS,
            YOUR INSECURITIES.
            I CAN'T DO
            ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
            I LOVE YOU.
            I'VE LOVED YOU
            EVER SINCE
            THE FIRST TIME
            I SAW YOU.
        THE AUDIENCE CAN'T HELP
        THEMSELVES, EITHER.
        YOU WALK ON,
        THEY LOVE YOU.
        BECAUSE YOU'RE YOURSELF.
        YOU'RE KIND
        AND VULNERABLE
        AND, WELL...NICE.
DO YOU REALLY
THINK SO?
            I DO.
        BUT YOU'RE
        SO WRACKED WITH GUILT
        ABOUT YOUR OLD
        MA'S SACRIFICES
        THAT YOU CAN'T
        EVEN NOTICE
        THAT THE AUDIENCE
        RATHER LIKES YOU...
        OR THAT YOU'RE
        A VERY GOOD ACTOR.
WELL, I...
I SUPPOSE NOT, NO.
        SO I WOULDN'T WORRY
        TOO MUCH ABOUT TOMORROW,
            CARNFORTH.
WELL, I MUST NOW
BE OFF TO BEDFORDSHIRE.
(DROPS SOMETHING)
OOPS. OH, WAIT.
(GIGGLING)
GOOD NIGHT.
    GOOD NIGHT.
            I THINK YOU SHOULD
            TAKE HER WITH YOU.
    WHERE?
            WHEREVER YOU GO.
                WHEREVER.
    THIS IS IT. YES.
    YES, I'VE GOT IT NOW.
    THIS IS RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY.
        I'VE GOT IT.
    I CAN MAKE A DECISION.
        OF COURSE I CAN.
        OF COURSE I CAN.
        MAKE A DECISION.
    THAT'S IT. I'VE GOT IT.
        YES, LORD.
        GO FOR IT!
                DARLING, IT IS
                A NIGHTMARE!
Joe: WE'RE FINE.
WE'RE FINE.
IT'S A TECHNICAL.
THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE THIS.
DON'T WORRY. WE'LL GO
AGAIN FROM THE ENTRANCE,
WE'LL LIGHTEN UP
ON THE SMOKE.
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
            OH, MARTHA MONEYGUTS
            HAS CHANGED HER TUNE
            SINCE YESTERDAY,
            HASN'T SHE?
SHE'S HAPPY NOW.
WE ALL LOOK LIKE
TV WEATHERMEN.
        ALL RIGHT,
        NOT BAD AT ALL.
        NOT BAD AT ALL.
        LISTEN, WE WERE
        NICE AND RELAXED.
        TECHNICALLY, WE WERE
        REMARKABLY SMOOTH.
        FANTASTIC, WELL DONE,
        MOLLY AND NINA,
        AND EVERYONE
        WHO'S HELPED ME OUT
        WITH SPECIAL EFFECTS,
        THAT'S GREAT--
                Margaretta:
                JOE, JOE!
    HELLO, MAGS.
                THANK GOD
                I FOUND YOU.
YOU'RE EARLY. WE DON'T
GO UP TILL 7:30.
LOOK, EVERYONE, THIS
IS MARGARETTA D'ARCY.
THIS IS
MY FRIEND, AGENT,
AND PERSONAL INVESTOR
IN THE SHOW.
            DARLING, I MUST
            TALK TO YOU.
    WHAT?
            I'VE GOT
            TO TALK TO YOU.
YEAH. OK, YEAH, SURE.
I'LL DO THE TECHNICAL
NOTES WITH YOU.
BE WITH YOU
IN 2 MINUTES, 2 MINUTES.
        (ALL TALKING)
        Nina: SO, VERNON,
        YOU TAKE THE THRONE OFF
        BEFORE THE FIGHT STARTS,
        OK?
            Vernon: OK, FINE,
            NO PROBLEM.
    Joe: I'VE AN IMPORTANT
    ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.
    AFTER OVER A YEAR OF
    SPECTACULAR UNEMPLOYMENT,
    DURING WHICH AS I'M SURE
    YOU'VE ALL GATHERED
    I'VE BEEN PRETTY DESPERATE,
    UH, I--I--I--I NOT
    ONLY HAVE A JOB,
    BUT, REALLY,<i> THE</i> JOB.
    YEAH, A GUARANTEED
    3-PICTURE DEAL
    IN A NEW SCIENCE FICTION
        MOVIE TRILOGY.
OHH.
                        OHH.
    TH-THE BAD NEWS...
            I'M SORRY, DARLING,
            BUT I'M GOING
            TO HAVE TO BE
            THE HEAVY HERE.
            THE BAD NEWS
            IS THAT JOE HAS
            TO LEAVE TONIGHT.
                    TONIGHT?
            YES. THE PRODUCER,
            NANCY CRAWFORD,
            IS IN THE COUNTRY
            RECCING
            FOREIGN LOCATIONS.
            SHE HAS
            A PRIVATE JET
            LEAVING CHELFORD
            AIRDROME AT 8:00.
            THEY START
            SHOOTING INTERIORS
            IN LOS ANGELES
            ON BOXING DAY.
            COULDN'T BE
            MORE LAST-MINUTE,
            BUT IT'S A WONDERFUL
            OPPORTUNITY FOR JOE.
            AND THERE REALLY
            IS NO CHOICE.
            SO I'M SURE YOU'LL
            ALL UNDERSTAND
            THAT THERE REALLY
            IS NO CHOICE.
    WELL...
SHE'S RIGHT, JOE.
THERE IS NO CHOICE.
YOU'VE GOTTA GO.
        CONGRATULATIONS, BOSS.
        YOU SAVED THE WORLD FROM
        MY NOSE JUST IN TIME.
    I'M SORRY, VERNON.
    THERE IS NO JUSTICE,
    AND I HATE YOU PASSIONATELY.
    GO FOR IT, YOU SWINE.
I'M SURE YOU'LL
GET THE CHANCE
TO DO IT AGAIN, JOE,
BUT JUST IN CASE,
I WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT I HAD
FINALLY CRACKED IT.
            DON'T GO.
            PLEASE DON'T GO.
        COME ON, NINA.
            BUT HE CAN'T.
            HE MUSTN'T.
            NOT JUST FOR US,
            BUT FOR HIM.
                DARLING, THERE
                IS NO COMPARI--
            YES, THERE IS!
            2 WEEKS AGO
            WE ALL MET UP
            TO START
            THIS ADVENTURE,
        AND MUCH THAT WE DIDN'T
        CARE TO ADMIT IT,
        WE'RE ALL IN OUR
        VARIOUS WAYS DEPRESSED.
        ESPECIALLY YOU, JOE.
        BUT WE NEEDED THIS JOB,
        THIS PLAY,
        THIS EXPERIENCE.
        AND ALL THROUGH
        OUR UPS AND DOWNS
        AND DISAGREEMENTS, WE'VE
        CONTINUED TO NEED IT.
    YES, WE DO, NINA.
    ACTORS DO, BUT...
    THE WORLD DOESN'T.
    FINALLY, IT'S SHAKESPEARE,
    AND NOBODY'S INTERESTED.
            THEY'RE INTERESTED
            IN HOPE.
                LOOK, THIS IS
                ALL VERY GOOD
                AND ALL VERY
                OVERDRAMATIC,
                BUT IT JUST
                ISN'T FAIR.
                YOU COULD DO
                THIS BLOODY PLAY
                ANYTIME,
                ANYWHERE.
        LOOK, NINA, JOE'S ONLY
        DOING WHAT MOST OF US
        WOULD GIVE
        OUR RIGHT ARMS TO DO.
    Joe: IT MEANS I CAN PAY
    YOU ALL. IT CAN BE PROPER!
                IT DOESN'T HAVE
                TO BE PROPER!
    IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE,
    FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!
    YOU SHOULD ALL BE
    WITH YOUR FAMILIES!
        WE'RE WITH OUR FAMILY.
        THAT'S WHAT ACTORS DO.
        THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO
        WITH WHAT'S LEFT
        OF HOPE.
        THEY HANG ON.
        THEY STICK IT OUT.
        NOW, THEY'RE
        HERE TONIGHT FOR US,
        AND WE HAVE TO DO
        THIS SHOW FOR THEM,
        AND IF YOU WON'T DO IT,
        WELL THEN...
            THEN I'LL
            BLOODY WELL DO IT!
            I'LL PLAY HAMLET!
            I PRACTICALLY
            KNOW IT NOW.
            IT'S BETTER
            THAN CANCELING.
            EVERYONE KNOWS
            THIS IS
            A WEIRD PRODUCTION.
        ONE MORE WEIRDO WON'T
        MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.
        BUT THIS IS OUR VILLAGE.
        IT'S OUR HOME.
        WE CAN'T LET THEM DOWN.
    WELL, THAT'S MARVELOUS,
    THEN, ISN'T IT?
WE'RE ALL TIRED
AND EMOTIONAL.
YOU GET OFF
AND CATCH THAT PLANE.
WE'D ALL DO THE SAME,
WHATEVER WE SAY NOW.
WE'RE ACTORS.
WE'RE BEGGARS.
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.
WE'LL DO THE SHOW TONIGHT
WITH YOUNG MISTRESS MOLLY,
AND WE'LL DRINK
TO YOUR HEALTH
OVER CHRISTMAS DINNER
TOMORROW.
            GET A SUNTAN.
                I'M SORRY, JOE.
YEAH, SURE.
    NINA.
        YOU PUT YOUR WHOLE LIFE
        INTO THIS, JOE,
        RIGHT FROM THE START.
        YOU NEEDED THIS JOB.
        YOU NEEDED IT THEN,
        AND YOU NEED IT NOW.
        I MEAN, IT'S NOT
        ABOUT FAME OR MONEY
        OR SO-CALLED WEALTH
        AND SECURITY.
        IT'S ABOUT NOURISHING
        YOUR SOUL,
        NOURISHING YOUR HEART.
        AND THAT'S
        WHAT YOU DESERVE.
        AT THE END OF THE DAY,
        HOWEVER HARD
        YOU HUG THAT PAYCHECK,
        IT WON'T BE A PERSON.
        IT WON'T BE US.
        IT WON'T BE ME.
        GO EASY ON YOURSELF,
        OLD CHAP.
        I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T
        ALL AFFORD THE LUXURY
        OF NOURISHING OUR SOULS.
        THAT'S THE PREROGATIVE
        OF THE ROMANTICS
        AMONG US, I FEAR.
        THESE THINGS HAPPEN.
        WHAT DOES HE SAY?
        "IF IT BE NOW,
        'TIS NOT TO COME.
        "IF IT BE NOT TO COME,
        "IT WILL BE NOW.
        "IF IT BE NOT NOW,
        "YET IT WILL COME.
        THE READINESS IS ALL."
        Henry: NINA, LISTEN!
        HE'S ONLY HUMAN!
        IF THAT HAD BEEN ME
        AT HIS AGE, I WOULDN'T
        EVEN HAVE STOPPED
        TO TELL THE COMPANY.
        I'D BE ON MY WAY
        TO THE AIRPORT.
YES, BUT HE'D
WORKED SO HARD!
        AND SO HAVE YOU!
        WHICH IS WHY
        YOU MUSTN'T LET
        A BEAUTIFUL PERFORMANCE
        LIKE YOURS
        BE SPOILT BECAUSE YOU'RE
        HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE.
WHO SAID I WAS
IN LOVE?
I JUST WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM.
WHAT'S BEST
FOR THE COMPANY.
        WHAT'S BEST
        FOR THE COMPANY
        IS FOR YOU TO GO
        OUT THERE AND GIVE
        THE BEST OPHELIA
        THE WORLD'S EVER SEEN.
YES, BUT HE WON'T
BE THERE TO SEE IT!
        YOU THINK LOVE'S ABOUT
        BEING IN THE SAME PLACE
            AT THE SAME TIME?
IT HELPS!
        SO IS DOING YOUR BEST
        FOR YOUR LOVED ONE
        WHEREVER THEY ARE.
        IT'S MUCH HARDER FOR HIM
        THAN IT IS FOR YOU.
        YOU SHOULD PARDON
        MY LANGUAGE.
        WHAT DID YOUR DAD SAY?
OH, HE WASN'T IN.
            WELL, IF I WAS
            YOUR DAD,
            I'D SAY DO
            THIS ONE FOR JOE.
            THINK OF HIM
            AND THE PAIN HE'S IN
            AND MAKE HIM
            PROUD UP THERE
            IN HIS RATHER
            LONELY AIRPLANE.
YOU'VE TURNED
INTO AN OLD SWEETIE,
HAVEN'T YOU?
            NO, I'M STILL
            A MISERABLE GIT,
            AND THIS IS ALL
            A FRONT TO STOP YOU
            FROM MESSING UP
            MY PERFORMANCE.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL
THINK ABOUT IT,
YOU MISERABLE
OLD TART.
PUSH OFF.
    THIS IS SO AMAZING.
    MOLLY, YOU'RE
    ACTUALLY LIVING
    THE ACTOR'S NIGHTMARE--
    WE ALL HAVE IT, DARLING.
    DREAMING ABOUT GOING ON
    IN A MAJOR ROLE
    TOTALLY UNPREPARED.
    IT'S SO EXCITING.
THANKS, TOM.
OH, GOD!
WHOEVER SAID
ACTORS WERE SISSIES?
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT.
GOD, I FEEL SICK.
            DON'T WORRY, LOVELY.
        IF I EVER FORGET
        MY LINES IN SHAKESPEARE,
        I ALWAYS SAY "CROUCH WE
        HERE AWHILE AND LURK."
        ALWAYS SEEMS TO DO
        THE TRICK.
WHY? WHAT HAPPENS?
        WELL, NOTHING, NORMALLY.
        BUT, YOU KNOW,
        PROVIDES A MOMENT
        OF INTRIGUE,
        GIVES YOU A CHANCE
        TO THINK OF SOMETHING,
        PICK UP A SCRIPT, MAYBE.
    THE FIGHT!
    IF IT ALL GOES WRONG,
    UM, DROP THE SWORD,
    TAKE THIS OFF,
    AND THROW IT AT ME.
    THEN I SAY "THE BOOT,
    THE BOOT WAS POISONED"
    AND DIE, BRILLIANT.
    THAT SHOULD WORK.
HELLO.
            Fadge: HELLO!
            LOVELY.
            ANYWHERE YOU LIKE.
            THANK YOU.
            WOULD YOU LIKE
            A PROGRAM?
YES, PLEASE.
            I'M SORRY,
            WE DON'T HAVE ANY.
                    YES, WE DO.
            YES, WE DO.
                THAT'LL BE 50p,
                THANK YOU.
        THAT'LL BE 50p,
        THANK YOU.
ANY ICE CREAM?
        WE HAVE HERBAL TEAS,
        NATURAL FRUIT JUICE,
        ORGANIC RICE CAKES
        WITH BALSAMIC CHOCOLATE,
            AND STRAW.
BUT ANY ICE CREAM?
            WHAT ARE YOU,
            A FASCIST?
                FADGE, I'VE GOT
                SOME ICE CREAM
                HERE IN
                THE COOL BOX.
        VERNON, YOU'RE A STAR.
        YES, STAY HERE.
    VERNON, YOU'RE A STAR.
    I'M COMPLETELY
    OUT OF MY DEPTH HERE.
    THE PAINT'S STILL WET
    ON THE THRONE,
    JOE'S COSTUME
    WON'T FIT MOLLY,
    THE SMOKE MACHINE
    IS PROBABLY
    DOWN AT THE BOOZER
    WITH CARNFORTH
    HAVING A QUICK ONE
    BEFORE THE SHOW.
    IF I WAS
    ANY MORE NERVOUS,
    I'D BE VERY,
    VERY NERVOUS.
            YOU'RE DOING
            WONDERFULLY WELL.
            BUT TELL ME.
            ARE YOUR NIPPLES
            HARD?
    IF THEY WERE
    ANY HARDER,
    TOM COULD DO CHIN-UPS
    FROM THEM.
            (OVERLAPPING
            CONVERSATIONS)
FALSE ECONOMY,
NOT HAVING A DRESSER.
MY SON'S IN THIS.
PLAYING ABOUT
15 DIFFERENT ROLES.
ONE OF THEM GOOD,
WE HOPE.
                    REALLY.
                WELL, MY DAD'S
                IN IT, TOO.
WHAT'S HE PLAYING?
                I'M NOT SURE.
Fadge: ONE MINUTE,
PLEASE!
ONE MINUTE, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN!
    'TIS A FAR, FAR BETTER
    THING THAT I DO NOW
    THAN I DID THAT NIGHT
    WITH THE SAILOR
    AND THE ARTICHOKE.
        OH, HUSH, MOTHER,
        BE WONDERFUL.
Vernon: NINA. NINA!
GOOD LUCK.
        THEY LOVE ME, YOU KNOW?
...THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF A PRIVATE PLANE, ISN'T IT?
THEY WAIT FOR YOU.
WE'RE ALL SO THRILLED.
        DOES THIS GUY
        BOTHER YOU?
NO.
        WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
                    MORTIMER.
        HE'S DOING A PROFILE
        ON ME FOR LONDON<i> TIMES.</i>
        THAT'S A GOOD PAPER,
        ISN'T IT?
THE BEST.
    HE FIGURED IT'D BE
    GOOD TO COVER ME
    CATCHING SOME ART.
        THESE ARE NEAT.
        TAKE SOME OF THOSE
        AND USE THEM
        WHEN WE PREVIEW
        THE MOVIE.

    A LITTLE MORE THAN KIN
    AND LESS THAN KIND.
        HOW IS IT
        THAT THE CLOUDS
        STILL HANG ON THEE?
NOT SO, MY LORD.
I AM TOO MUCH
IN THE SUN.
        GOOD HAMLET, CAST OFF
        THY COLORED NIGHTIE
        AND LET THINE EYE
        LOOK LIKE A FRIEND
        ON DENMARK.
DARLING, DARLING!
DOROTHY, DRAMA HAS COME
TO LIVE WITH US
IN A BIG WAY.
NANCY CRAWFORD HAS
DELAYED HER FLIGHT
TO COME SEE HER NEW BOY
IN ACTION
AND SHE'S GOT
<i> THE TIMES</i> WITH HER.
    WE ARE GOING TO BE
    REVIEWED, DARLING,
        BY A NATIONAL
        NEWSPAPER.
SO, HE'S JUST COME BACK
FOR THE ONE PERFORMANCE?
        BE REASONABLE, NINA.
        HE SAVED THE SHOW,
        HE SAVED MOLLY FROM
        A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN,
        HE SAVED US THE CHANCE
        OF A WONDERFUL NOTICE.
    I THINK IT'S
    SHAMEFUL.
NINA, I--
I WAS GOING TO BE
RATHER GOOD, I THOUGHT.
        I THINK YOU KNELT
        BEAUTIFULLY.
    A BLOODY, BAWDY VILLAIN!
    REMORSELESS, TREACHEROUS,
    LECHEROUS,
        KINDLESS VILLAIN
        OF VENGEANCE!
                YES.
MY LORD, HOW DOES YOUR HONOR
FOR THIS MANY A DAY?
            I HUMBLY THANK YOU,
            WELL. WELL, WELL.
    MY LORD, I HAVE
    REMEMBRANCES OF YOURS
    THAT I HAVE LONGED
    LONG TO REDELIVER.
    I PRAY YOU, NOW,
    RECEIVE THEM.
            NO, NOT I. I NEVER
            GAVE YOU AUGHT.
    MY HONORED LORD, YOU KNOW
    RIGHT WELL YOU DID!
    AND WITH THE WORDS
    OF SO SWEET BREATH COMPOSED
    HAS MADE THE THINGS
    MORE RICH.
    THEIR PERFUME LOST,
    TAKE THESE AGAIN,
    FOR TO THE NOBLE MIND
    RICH GIFTS WAX POOR
    WHEN GIVERS PROVE UNKIND.
    THERE, MY LORD.

THIS PLAY?
        THE LADY DOTH PROTEST
        TOO MUCH, METHINKS.
                OH, BUT SHE'LL
                KEEP HER WORD.
        HAVE YOU HEARD
        THE ARGUMENT?
        IS THERE NO OFFENSE
        IN IT?
NO, NO, THEY DO
BUT JEST,

NO OFFENSE
IN THE WORLD.
            WHAT DO YOU CALL
            THE PLAY?

        THAT'S CALM

        WHAT IS A MAN IF HIS

            YOU WERE MARVELOUS!

        NO, YOU WERE MARVELOUS!
            YOU WERE MARVELOUS,
            MARVELOUS!
    CARNFORTH?
                        MUM!
                    WERE YOU--
                    DID YOU?
I'M AFRAID I DID.
AND I'M VERY CROSS
WITH YOU.
                        REALLY?
    YES.
YOU BROKE MY HEART
AS HORATIO.
I WAS IN TEARS
MOST OF THE EVENING.
                        REALLY?
    YES.
        WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK,
        MRS. BRANCH?
    YES, PLEASE.
DARLING!
IT'S A TRIUMPH!
        EXCUSE ME. GOD,
        YOU WERE GOOD!
        WASN'T HE?
YES.
                OH, VERNON,
                MY BOY, I'M--
            FADGE, OUR DESIGNER.
            THANK YOU, DARLING.
Henry: TERRY?
                YEAH?
VISITOR FOR YOU.
                CHRIST.
HELLO, DAD.
HENRY DROPPED ME
A LINE,
TOLD ME WHAT
YOU WERE UP TO.
            WELL, IT'S NOT QUITE
            <i> PUSS IN BOOTS</i>
           <i> IN BRADFORD, IS IT?</i>
OH, YOU WERE
VERY GOOD IN THAT.
I'M SURE IT'S JUST
AS HARD TO DO PANTO.
            OH, IT IS, LOVE.
            IT'S A BIT EASIER
            ON THE HEARTSTRINGS,
            THOUGH.
            HOW'S YOUR, UH--
OH, SHE'S VERY WELL.
SHE SENDS HER BEST.
                    REALLY?
REALLY.
                    REALLY?
REALLY!
WE BOTH GOT
QUITE A TURN
FROM HENRY'S LETTER.
I--WE BOTH THOUGHT IT...
TIME TO BE A LITTLE MORE--
WELL, I'M JUST
VERY GLAD I SAW IT.
I THINK YOU'RE
A WONDERFUL QUEEN!
                    (SNORTS)
IN EVERY WAY!
                CHEEKY BUGGER!
SO, I HAVE
TO GET BACK.
FOR CHRISTMAS EVE
AND ALL.
                    OF COURSE.
BUT I'D LIKE
TO BRING MUM
AND ME GIRLFRIEND.
NEXT WEEK, MAYBE?
                YES, LOVELY.
GREAT. WELL, LOOK...
I'LL BE OFF.
WELL DONE, DAD.
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE GREAT.
                    THANK YOU.
        Terry: GOOD-BYE.
THANKS, HARRY.
        HENRY.
            HENRY WAKEFIELD,
        WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU
        PUT IN THAT LETTER?
    I TOLD HER
    YOU HAD CHOLERA.
IT'S BETTER TALLER.
TALLER AND CHUNKIER.
CHUNKY IS GOOD.
SEE, I CAN MAKE
A LOT MORE VALUE
OUT OF THE SPATIAL
RELATIONSHIPS.
            EXACTLY, DARLING.
            WELL, YOU KNOW
            SHAKESPEARE.
            I MEAN,
            IF YOU CAN GET
            THE SPATIAL
            RELATIONSHIPS RIGHT,
            YOU CAN--IT'S--
            UM, UH, OFTEN CAN BE
            SO MUCH BETTER.
        I'LL JUST GO
        AND FILE THIS.
        EDITOR'S RATHER
        INTRIGUED TO HAVE
        A SHAKESPEARE REVIEW
        IN THE PANTO SEASON.
        THANK YOU.
            LOOK, NINA, PLEASE.
            LET ME TRY
            TO EXPLAIN--
AH, WELL,
IF IT ISN'T
THE VERY SAD
SWEDISH PERSON HISSELF.
        JOE, THIS IS
        NANCY CRAWFORD.
                OH, HELLO.
                IT WAS VERY
                KIND OF YOU
                TO COME
                TO THE PLAY.
YEAH, WELL, I FIGURED
I'D CHECK OUT ANY GUY
WHO CAN TURN ME
DOWN LIKE THAT.
I MEAN, HE MUST
BE WORTH WATCHING,
HOWEVER STUPID.
            YOU SAID NO?
        YES, BEFORE
        THE SHOW.
        RATHER DISPROVES
        YOUR THEORY
        FROM MARTYR CENTRAL,
        DOESN'T IT?
    STILL, AS IN
    ALL BOX OFFICE HITS,
        WE DO HAVE
        A HAPPY ENDING.
        I'D LIKE Y'ALL
        TO MEET THE NEW SMEGMA.
    AND MY OWN PERSONAL
    COSTUME DESIGNER.
        OH, I LOVE YOUR
        LITTLE THIN PEOPLE.
YOU DO?
        WE'RE GONNA BASE
        SMEGMA'S LOOK
        ON SOME OF THESE.
        I MEAN,
        IT WAS SO NEAT.
        THE WHOLE THING WAS LIKE
        A JUDY GARLAND MOVIE.
        YOU'RE GONNA
        BE GREAT.
        I MEAN,
        TALLER IS BETTER.
        WE NEED YOUR KIND
        OF PHYSIQUE, YOU KNOW,
        AND ALL THOSE
        DIFFERENT ACCENTS.
        YOU HAVE TO GET
        A LOT OF CHARACTER
        UNDER LATEX.
        WHERE ARE YOU
        FROM ORIGINALLY?
    NORWAY.
        THAT IS GREAT FOR
        THE EUROPEAN INVESTORS.
        AND DON'T YOU
        WORRY, HONEY.
        I'LL MAKE SURE
        HE'S NAKED
        FOR THE FIRST 2 WEEKS
        OF THE SHOOT
        SO YOU HAVE TIME FOR
        YOUR COSTUME CONCEPT.
        YOU'RE GONNA
        LOVE NATHAN.
        HE'S A WONDERFUL
        DESIGNER.
        HE JUST COULDN'T
        FIND HIS SMEGMA.
                TOM, YOU'RE
                PLAYING SMEGMA
                IN THE NEW
                SCI-FI FILM
                <i> GALAXY</i>
                <i> TERMINUS?</i>
            YOU ARE
            TOO QUICK
            FOR YOUR OWN GOOD,
            DARLING.
        WELL,
        I HOPE HE IS.
        I DON'T NEED ANY MORE
        FUCK UPS ON THIS ROLE.
        DO YOU HAVE AN OUT
        IN YOUR CONTRACT?
    SORRY?
        DID YOUR AGENT
        NEGOTIATE
        A WAY FOR YOU
        TO LEAVE THE SHOW
        SHOULD SUCH
        A THING HAPPEN?
            Vernon: HE HASN'T
            GOT AN AGENT.
    HUH?
                YES, HE DOES.
            AND OBVIOUSLY
            WE'LL MAKE
            SOME COMPENSATION
            TO THE MANAGEMENT.
            WE'LL TALK
            ABOUT IT, JOE.
    MY. WELL, WE ALL HAVE
    A PLANE TO CATCH.
        BOB?
    TOM. I'LL BE
    RIGHT ALONG.
        UH-HUH.
        SNATCH?
FADGE. RIGHT
WITH YOU, BOSS.
        AND MICKEY
        AND JUDY,
    YOU TWO WERE FINE.
    YOU KEEP IT UP,
    OK, KIDS?
            FOR WHAT IT'S
            WORTH, DARLING,
            I THOUGHT YOU WERE
            A WONDERFUL HAMLET.
        DO YOU HAVE
        REPRESENTATION, SNOT?
FADGE.
    Nancy:
    MARGARETTA!
        COMING, NANCY!
        HERE. CALL ME.
    I THINK I'M
    GOING TO FAINT.
OH, GOD! THIS IS
ALL RIGHT, ISN'T IT?
I MEAN, MY WORK'S
DONE HERE, ISN'T IT?
MOLLY CAN
JUST AS EASILY
FILL IN FOR TOM,
CAN'T SHE?
            OH, NO, OF COURSE
            IT'S ALL RIGHT.
            WITH THE
            COMPENSATION,
            WE CAN HIRE SOMEONE
            TO WORK THE LIGHTS
            AND SELL
            THE TICKETS.
            NO, LOOK, LOOK,
            LOOK!
            I'M JUST VERY
            PLEASED FOR YOU.
            DELIGHTED.
            REALLY, I AM.
                Terry: JUST LIKE
                A FAIRY TALE.
Henry: BLOODY NIGHTMARE,
MORE LIKE.
                Terry: SHUT UP.
        Carnforth:
        OH, NINA, DARLING.
        I JUST REMEMBERED.
        THERE'S A VISITOR
        FOR YOU OUT FRONT.
            All: OOH!
                Terry: TALL,
                DARK STRANGER.
            DAD! I CAN'T
            BELIEVE IT!
            I CAN'T BELIEVE
            YOU CAME!
            DID YOU LIKE IT?
            DID YOU?
YOU WERE WONDERFUL.
            OH, DAD! THIS IS
            MY FAMILY--
        I MEAN, MY FRIENDS--
        AND THEY'RE WONDERFUL.
            I WANT YOU
            TO MEET THEM ALL
            AND--AND THIS IS
            THE MOST UTTERLY--
        STUPID...
                HEROIC MAN.
            I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
THANK YOU.
IT'S NOT OFTEN
YOU TURN DOWN
LIFELONG
FINANCIAL SECURITY
AND A GREAT CAREER.
            OH, RUBBISH. YOU
            HAVE A GREAT CAREER.
            AND YOU HAVE ME.
REALLY?
                IF YOU'D LIKE.
        GET HIS NAME ON
        THE DOTTED LINE, LOVE,
        HE'S A SHIFTY GIT.
            (MUSIC BEGINS)
                WOULD YOU LIKE
                TO DANCE?
I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T DANCE.
                I THOUGHT BETTER
                OF IT.
            AND, I RECKON, IF I
            PLAY MY CARDS RIGHT
            I MIGHT GET MY LEG
            OVER TONIGHT.
OH! I'M NOT JUST
A FABULOUSLY ATTRACTIVE
SEX OBJECT, YOU KNOW.
            YES, YOU ARE.
OH, FAIR ENOUGH.
WON'T YOUR DAD
BE APPALLED BY ALL THIS?
            OH, NO, HE KNOWS
            ALL ABOUT YOU.
            CHECK OUT
            HIS PHONE BILL.
            I THINK HE'S JUST
            ACCEPTED HIS LAST
            REVERSE CHARGE CALL
            FROM ME.
        ACTORS. THEY'RE ALL
        THE SAME, AREN'T THEY?
    Henry: OH, THIS
    IS MARVELOUS.
YOU KNOW, DESPITE
MY IMMENSE PURITY OF SOUL
AND BEING CLEANSED
BY MY ART,
I'M STILL GONNA GET
DEPRESSED AND MAD.
            YES, BUT WE CAN GET
            DEPRESSED TOGETHER.
            THAT'S FUN.
AREN'T YOU ALWAYS
GOING TO BE OPTIMISTIC?
            NO, I'M GOING
            TO BE MISERABLE
            AND FATTER THAN
            A HUGE SAGGY OX.
    OH, LOVELY. I CAN JUST
    FEEL IT STARTING.
        (LAUGHTER)
        (CARILLON CHIMES)
    Nina: LISTEN, EVERYONE!
        MERRY CHRISTMAS!
    All: MERRY CHRISTMAS!
