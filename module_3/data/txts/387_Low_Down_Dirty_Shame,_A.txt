Oh, here we go.
- Housekeeping!
- Can you spell ''Do not disturb''?
Can you spell Lysol? You better check
your pulse, you might be dead.
Housekeeping!
Well! Work him, girl!
Housekeeping!
Get rid of her.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Good day, gentlemen.
Nice and easy, nobody move.
One by one, put your guns on the table,
nice and slow.
- What do you want?
- I called the Psychic Hotline today.
The lady told me
I could find wealth and happiness here.
I'll be damned, she was right.
She was.
- How much is the insurance paying me?
- Ten thousand dollars.
- There's a million dollars on that table!
- I see.
Jack is a lying son of a bitch.
Go get the car.
You gonna be all right? I've been doing
my karate and going to the gun range.
Get your karate-kicking gun range ass
in the car, now!
You, over there.
I'm Chun Yung Fat.
Do you know what that means?
Yeah, you come with the egg roll
and miso soup.
Don't fuck with me.
I got fired from the post office.
I could flip out and kill.
You, get that.
- Yeah.
- Let me speak to the big man with the gun.
One day, we will meet again.
Next time, bring some breath mints.
- It's for you.
- Say ''Ah''.
Aaaah!
Don't act like it's your first time.
<i>Shame?</i>
Yo, Shame, you got company, and lots of it.
Up the stairs and east and west elevators.
I'll have a car on the side of the building.
Good looking-out.
If you need back-up, I got my .22 and
my stun gun. We can wreck shit! Shame!
You. Nice and slow.
Toss those over to me.
Now, if I bend down to pick those up,
are you gonna try to kill me?
Come on. Be honest.
Fucking A right! I'm gonna kill your ass!
You stupid fuck!
Say hi to Arnold.
Shit!
You boys aren't gonna make this easy,
are you?
- Gone!
- My men'll find him and whack him.
I'm gonna cut his fucking balls off!
Fuck! You're upstairs. You're downstairs.
He's in the stairwell.
- All right, let's go, right now!
- Don't make me 'jack this limo!
Now, I told you, he will be here!
Everybody just chill. Just relax.
Don't make me get rowdy.
It is not a pretty sight.
Over there!
- Will you be joining us for lunch, sir?
- No, I'll have mine to go.
There he is!
ls that the police?
All right, that is it! Let's go.
You ain't got a choice but wait.
He'll be right down here.
Hi, Peaches.
- Now, see, I told you...
- Let me have that.
Driver, let's go.
Let me finish telling the story.
She walks into the street,
she doesn't even look where she's going.
And then bam!
She got hit by a big-ass truck!
<i>- What?
- She was in a coma for a week.</i>
<i>- You're not gonna believe this.
- What? Girl, come on! What?</i>
<i>- She died.
- Oh!</i>
<i>Peaches, don't leave me hanging!
Pick up the phone. Peaches!</i>
<i>- Peaches!
- What? No, I'm here. I'm here.</i>
I just can't believe this is happening to her.
She's such good people.
I mean, look at this. This is so sad.
<i>I'm so sorry.
I know this must be tearing you apart.</i>
This is worse than when James died
on ''Good Times''.
<i>I remember that episode!</i>
<i>Chad, I need to talk to you.
It's important, Chad.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>I'm pregnant. And it's yours!</i>
What? Oh, that is it!
You two-timing, can't-get-enough bastard!
I hope your prostate falls out.
I gotta go. I gotta go.
See, you need to stop talking to me
every day.
Get you and Mickey Moon jobs,
so you can get off them county cheques.
<i>- I ain't on no county cheques!
- Call me later.</i>
<i>- That's FEMA I'm getting.
- Yeah, whatever.</i>
Trippin'. Just lazy!
Morning, Shame. How are you feeling?
You haven't been running up my phone bill,
have you?
- No!
- Turn that loud-ass shit down, will you?
I cannot do that. The radio station's
having a contest for $10,000,
and today might be my lucky day!
Shame, the least you could do is shave.
- I'm clean.
- You need to wear a sign that says so.
- And why don't you dress up any more?
- Who for? You?
If you took more care of yourself,
somebody besides me could put up with you.
Watch out! I like that freaky shit!
Haven't you ever heard of that expression
''Dress for success''?
They're ready to turn off my phone.
They cancelled my credit cards.
About to repossess my car.
I'd say I am dressed for my success.
You need to go to the bank.
They're about to foreclose this place, too.
That would make you homeless,
office-less, Peaches-less.
- You wouldn't work out of a cardboard box?
- Exactly. Mr Gold left this for you.
Why you holding out?
That's what l been waiting on.
Let's see here... What the fuck is this?
''The repairs to the limousine and the
window have been deducted from your fee.''
Peaches... You know that money I owe you?
Save it!
Don't worry about it, Shame.
I got a little money saved up,
so I should be all right.
When I get back on my feet,
I'm gonna kick you down, right?
Please! You got some company down there.
- Hey, Sonny, what's up, man?
- Hey, Shame!
Gimme one sec, I'll be right there.
- What's up, Sonny?
- Hey, Shame, how you doing?
Look at you, looking like new money!
Check you out!
How they treating you in DC?
Well, you know, I miss the streets,
but it's a pay cheque.
- You remember Peaches?
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hangin' in there.
- You still with this bum?
- Yeah, I'm trying to get into heaven.
- And giving me hell all the way!
Come on in, man.
Something to drink? Soda?
Yeah, a soda, and none of that healthy shit.
Get the man a soda, will you?
- You ain't got no sodas!
- You got one in your desk, right?
- Yes, in my desk.
- Well, get the man a soda.
Thank you.
Have a seat, man. So, Sonny,
what brings you to my neck of the woods?
Shame.
How'd you like to work a case with me?
- What's the DEA need with me?
- Not the DEA. Me.
This is personal.
Off the record, and tailor-made for you.
OK. You got my curiosity.
You remember her?
Is this a joke? Yeah, I remember her.
She turned him in, Shame. Six months ago,
she came into my office and told me...
the man she was living with
was Ernesto Mendoza.
And the next day, she skipped town.
What is this?
Mendoza's dead, and you know it, man.
Oh, yeah? You sure about that?
After you shot him,
did you check his vitals? Huh?
Or were you trying
to get your ass out of there?
Think about it, Shame.
What if he's not dead?
What if he changed his face?
Laid low and then resurfaced?
Hey, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to
find yourself another guy. I ain't with this.
Find another guy, my ass!
Mendoza was your prize!
We worked five years at infiltrating him.
It ended in a bloodbath
with us on the short end of the stick.
Yeah, and I don't need you coming in here,
reminding me about Mexico.
I had my nightmares.
That shit is behind me now.
Oh, yeah?
When's the last time you been out?
When's the last time you had a good time?
When's the last time you had a date?
Look at yourself, Shame. You look like shit.
You're taking on suicide jobs,
just to make a buck.
What are you? A fucking therapist?
I'm your friend.
He beat you,
and I'm giving you a chance to get even.
How do you know she's even in LA?
Surveillance photos at LAX
put her here two months ago.
- You run her through the computers?
- Every single one. Nothing.
Shame, I've only got three days.
What do you say?
- I'll find her in two.
- Yes, yes!
Look, I gotta run, OK?
But if you need anything,
I can be reached at this number.
Hey, Sonny, one thing. You promise me I'm
there when you slap the cuffs on Mendoza.
Under one condition.
You dress for the occasion.
- I don't want him to see you like this.
- I'll even get a haircut.
This is gonna be great, like the old days.
- I'll call you.
- OK, I'll talk to you. Bye, Peaches.
Where do we start?
Well...how about this?
- ''Covenant''?
- The only perfume she wears.
Very exotic, very expensive,
and very hard to find.
- That's the only place in LA that sells it.
- Now, how do you know all this?
I bought a bottle once, for her birthday.
Wait a minute. Hold up! You mean to tell me
that you used to date her?
Why you got to say it like that?
Because you look... No, she looks like...
Yeah, I guess you're right.
We are from two different worlds.
Is that why you two broke up?
No. She left me for another guy.
You get to do what you do best today.
Go shopping.
Check that place out
and a couple of shops in the area.
Buy a few things, ask a few questions.
See what you can dig up.
Like what? A sock? A key chain?
What?
In Beverly Hills, this little bit of change
is only gonna buy me trinkets.
- Shit! I know you're trying to trick me.
- Ain't nobody trying to trick you.
- Look, come on, Peaches!
- Give it up, big daddy!
I better not hear you was down
at the swapmeet going wild with my money.
Hmm. Thank you.
Hey, hey, come on. Look here, now!
Look, I need a file, right?
You got the proper paperwork?
Paperwork? I need paperwork?
I'm tired of hooking you up.
I'm the one that hooks you up.
When was the last time you hooked me up?
You forgot about Sheila? Nice ass.
I turned that number over to you.
You rolled her over!
She was in a wheelchair.
- I didn't say nothing 'bout her legs.
- That acne?
But you hit it, right?
What kind of questions you asking me,
brother?
Benny, did you?
Everything was good? It was good, right?
Come on back. You sick, man.
I told you,
don't sleep on the handicapped, brother!
You got a current address on him?
Gimme a few days, I'll get it.
No, just do me a favour.
- Give me a copy of this.
- Take it.
Just take it, take it, just take it.
- You like theatre, right?
- I used to be an actor.
Here, I got these from a client.
Take anybody you want.
Ah, thanks, Shame.
I tell ya, I hook ya up, Benny.
- Thursday at the Forum.
- OK. Thanks, man.
OK, Peace, Benny.
''Gary Coleman is Mr Bojangles!''
Hey! What the fuck are you doing here?
- Got myself a missing persons case.
- No shit?
No shit. I saw you on TV this morning.
You broke that jewellery heist all by yourself?
Give it up for the lieutenant!
Knock it off! Back to work.
Get outta here!
I think I see a cape hanging out your back,
man!
Look, up in the sky! It's a bird,
it's a plane, it's a 50-year-old Puerto Rican!
Hey, Peaches.
<i>- Come get me on Rodeo. Got some info.
- Yeah, I'll meet you there in a minute.</i>
Hi!
- So, you like?
- Salt n' Pepa had a garage sale?
You know what? For somebody to be as
smart as you are, you ain't got no class.
Let me enlighten you about a few things.
This is Frimi.
- Frime.
-This is Frimi, with an I, not an E.
OK? Now, they had a designer sale.
So I took advantage.
No shit? Did they throw in a beeper
and a get out of jail free card?
And just because
I am such a thoughtful person,
I got you a little something, too.
- For me?
- And those are silk.
Silk drawers and a red tie? Oh, I've got
to wear these together. Get off me, ladies!
I hear the ladies screaming my name!
''Shame! Shame! Shame!''
''Leave me alone.
Stop talking at my silk drawers.''
- Are you making fun of me?
- Yeah. What else did you get?
You were right. She came here
about a month ago, looking for that perfume.
They didn't have any, so she left this number
and that PO box for the mailing list.
First thing in the morning,
I want you to go and see what's in this box.
Oh, my God!
Any truth to the evil twin rumour, Chad?
- It is him! It is Chad.
- Who?
Chad!
Chad! Chad from ''As the Heart Turns''!
That's right, sweetheart. The one and only.
- Peaches!
- That's what you get for dogging Donna!
And if you sleep with her sister,
I will come back for you.
Don't think that I won't. I don't play that.
You knew better than to pull crap like that!
Watch your back!
What's up, y'all?
Shame. Otra vez.
What is it that you want?
We're trying to have dinner here.
Thanks for inviting me, man.
I love Mexican food. You gonna eat this?
Mm! Delicioso!
What is it that you want, Shame?
Well, I thought
maybe we could help each other.
El pollo loco to you, too!
What kind of help can you give me, huh?
From what l hear,
you're not even a cop any more.
So why don't you do us all a big favour
and get the fuck out of here?
Ouch! Luis!
Why you want to talk to me like that?
Damn! You gonna diss me like that
after all these years?
Shit! I knew Luis when he used to sell PCP
to school kids.
But now you're on top and I'm not.
That's cool. All I want you to do
is deliver a message.
I want you to tell Mendoza
that I know he's alive.
And there's no place that he can hide.
I'm gonna be wrecking shit like a 7.0,
and when he falls, his ass is mine.
And this time, I will not miss.
Pobrecito Shame. You should have left
when you had the chance, amigo.
They sell some stuff on TV you can spray
on your head and cover your bald spot.
Have a seat.
OK. You respect my shit,
and I'll respect yours.
Buenas noches, shitheads.
Hey, Shame. Hello!
How many fingers?
You don't look too good.
Let me give you some advice.
Stay out of business that's not yours.
You keep chasing ghosts,
you're gonna end up in a graveyard.
Wait a minute!
Shoot, knocking on my door like that!
Who the hell is it, any-goddamn-way,
this time of night?
It better be Ed McMahon with a lot of money!
Must be crazy, coming here.
What happened to you?
I went partying
with Rodney King and Reginald Denny.
I'm onto something.
I gotta go see Rothmiller in the morning.
Come on.
- Easy.
- Hold still.
Shame?
How come the only time I get to hold you
is when you're all bloody and bruised?
Are you coming on to me?
Ow! Shit!
What the fuck did you do that for?
You're an asshole, making fun of me!
- You're serious.
- Yes, I am.
Remember the first time we met?
I busted you,
stuffing CDs in your underwear.
Whatever.
I've been feeling this way since then.
I was only 16 and I knew it wouldn't work.
But I am 22, going on 23.
Can't you see
how much I've grown since then?
You're not wearing that trainer no more?
Is everything a fucking joke to you?
Can't you allow yourself to feel anything?
- Come here.
- Forget you. I ain't coming over there.
Come on. Sit down.
OK.
FYI, I have noticed.
I watched you grow from an adorable
little girl to a beautiful young lady.
You're smart. You're funny.
You love life. Beautiful.
Don't forget sexy.
Very sexy.
Well, what is the problem, Shame?
We have nothing in common.
Oh, how can you sit there
and say something like that?
What about boxing? We both love boxing.
OK.
Who's the greatest heavyweight of all time?
- Tyson.
- The greatest heavyweight of all time?
- Tyson could beat Muhammad Ali?
- That's right.
Tyson can't spell Muhammad Ali.
What the... Wait a minute!
Muhammad Ali can't spell Muhammad Ali.
- Did I show you the tapes of Ali?
- I saw them! They don't mean nothing.
Ali dances around the ring so much,
it's like watching a rerun of ''Soul Train''.
See, now, that's what l'm talking about.
At least you thought about it.
Yeah, I thought about it.
Well, my room-mate won't be home till late,
so the bed is yours if you want.
Your room-mate won't freak out
if she finds a half-naked man in the bed?
Trust me. If my room-mate
finds a half-naked man in the bed,
freaking out
is the last thing girlfriend will do.
Good night, Shame.
Peaches.
I see something has grown
since you was 16.
Hey, girl, I hope you don't mind.
Peaches said I could crash in your room.
My, no, honey! Ain't nothing like
coming home to a warm man in the bed.
- Who the hell are you?
- Ex-squeeze me! This is my room!
- You show me some tits, or die.
- Miss Peaches, you need to come in here!
- Peaches!
- OK, OK. Wait a minute. All right.
Shame, this is my room-mate, Wayman.
Wayman, this is Shame.
- Why didn't you say she was a guy?
- You ain't never asked.
- What was that ''girlfriend'' stuff about?
- Please! ''Girlfriend'' is an expression.
Well, excuse me, ''girlfriend.''
I'm gonna shower
and pretend I'm not in ''The Crying Game''.
He is a cutie-pie! You got to read this article.
This is something else!
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Shame.
You look at me
like you're gonna take a picture.
Peaches? Peaches!
Why do you read that nonsense?
Because it's informative.
Informative? Yeah, right. Let's see here.
I bet you everything in here's a lie.
''Arsenio Hall Gets Butt Reduction.''
Ah! Page two.
A monkey named Bo-Bo gets tax tips
from aliens. Real informative.
Excuse me! I'll have you know
I saved a hundred dollars last year.
And if you weren't so closed-minded,
maybe you could learn a little something.
- Like?
- You know how you're afraid of dogs?
Now, stop right there. Stop right there.
I don't like dogs. I'm not afraid of them.
Hand me that toast.
Oh, so now you're gonna front!
If I remember correctly,
there was a certain somebody
who jumped up on my grandmother's table
when I brought in her tiny puppy
named Taffy.
Taffy should have been named Damien.
That dog was possessed. I saw his head
spin and green shit fly out of his mouth.
Anyway, it says in here that if you sing
James Brown songs, dogs will not attack.
James Brown tried that
with the state troopers.
Whatever.
- What's he cooking? Smells good.
- Sausages. Want one?
- No.
- More beef for us.
- I like cooking when I'm dealing with meat.
- Wayman sure can burn.
He should keep his head
away from the stove while he's burning.
Oh, no, he didn't. Miss Peaches?
Shame, I told you,
he is very sensitive about his hair.
He should be.
Looks like Woodstock went peroxide crazy.
You didn't mind it last night,
when you ran your fingers through it.
- I didn't touch you.
- Don't get your boxers in a bunch
just 'cause you was cruising in your sleep
last night and started speeding.
- That's it!
- Now, hold up.
I got to go to the post office.
Can you manage to get along
for ten minutes while I'm gone?
- I'm cool, Peaches.
- Tell Little Richard to stay away from me.
You better behave yourself.
On the way to the post office, can you
stop by the store and get some relaxer?
And make sure it says ''mild''.
Last time you got me super!
Where have you been all my life?
All your life? I have no idea.
So, how can I get those digits?
Digits? Let me think...
There's my friend. I have to go.
I had to put up with greasy Jheri Curl
and bad breath to get this.
That was everything that was in her box.
What about the number
the salesperson had?
- Turned out to be a service.
- Figures.
- Now what?
- I want you to call and leave a message.
Tell her the perfume is coming in today
at 2.00.
What if she shows up
and there's no perfume?
Let me worry about the details.
Put all that back.
Shame, do not make me go back in there.
You got an admirer, huh?
All right, I'll take care of it.
- Yo, my man. See that lady over there?
- Yeah.
She's crazy about you, bro.
Let me get out of you lovebirds' way.
- Real 14K.
- Don't make me use my stun gun.
I'm trying to make your day.
<i>Remember 82.3, the phrase
that pays. I'm the Duke of Dance...</i>
May I help you?
- Yes. Denise?
- Diane.
- I want something for my girlfriend.
- Your girlfriend.
Well, this is just lovely. Feel the leather.
You can tell by the smoothness and texture
that this animal died of natural causes.
Really?
Oh, damn. Five hundred!
You have anything that was shot or stabbed?
I have an idea.
Why don't you go to Pick & Spends?
You can get a hat, a jacket and a bag
with money to spare.
You're right. I should just go home
and break open the piggy bank.
- I'll be back.
- I'll wait on it.
- Good afternoon. Sincati.
- Turn your radio down!
<i>- Hold on.
- Diane Kendricks?</i>
- Who is this?
- It's the Duke of Dance.
If you can tell me the phrase that pays,
you'll win $10,000!
<i>Now, tell me, Diane,
what's your favourite radio station?</i>
- 82.3?
- That's right!
Diane, you are our new winner!
<i>I knew something good
was gonna happen today!</i>
I knew it!
My big toe was swollen
and my uterus has been doing flips all day!
Oh, God! Jesus loves me!
Oh, God! Thank you!
You only have 82.3 minutes to shake that
moneymaker down here and get your prize.
- Today's my day!
- My scarf.
- Aren't you gonna wrap my scarf?
- Wear it, bitch!
Go! Thank you. Please come again.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry,
but this club is for women only.
I have a friend in there.
I need to speak to her.
Look, pal, the sign says ''Women Only''.
- Shame?
- Wayman, what's up?
- What are you doing here?
- I work here.
What about the wigs and costumes
and ''energy is mine'' and all that?
- That's a hobby. This pays the bills.
- Do me a big favour.
I'm tailing somebody and I need to know
if she lost me. I can't get in.
You're a little late. I'm leaving for lunch
and fish is not on the menu.
Yoo-hoo, Wayman.
Hi, Bernard.
Excuse me. Who's this?
Bernard. What's wrong with you?
<i>The Bernard?</i>
Home-wrecker! He's with me!
- What?
- I can't believe you just did that.
- You are my stuff and you know it.
- Stuff!
He's lying. Don't believe him.
You did not say that last night
when we was in bed together.
You slept with him! You slut!
Bernard!
You never had a chance.
Coffee's good with cream, but better black.
Don't you ever, ever call me again.
And you, Mr Coffee,
if you'd like some steamed milk
with your double espresso, I'm your man.
Bernard, I'm sorry! I'll call you!
Why did you do that?
Work with me, and I'll call and tell him
it was a joke. Here's what she looks like.
- Who is it?
- It's Hank.
- Sure those are for me?
- The man said 1504, Angela Flowers.
OK, thanks.
Hank, did he tell you who...
Is that the way to treat the man
you said you'd spend your life with?
- You look good.
-You look like shit.
- Today was laundry day.
- If this is a social call...
Don't let the flowers fool you.
It's strictly business. Now, sit down.
- Thought you weren't a cop any more.
- I'm not.
I'm a private investigator,
working with the DEA.
<i>- DEA. May I help you?
- Special Agent Rothmiller, please.</i>
<i>- It's me, Shame.
- Sonny, I got her.</i>
<i>- Where?
- 8517 Artesian Way.</i>
<i>- I'm on my way.
- See you in a minute.</i>
- Hey, primo.
- Hey, primo.
They found the girl.
I want you to handle this, primo.
Bring the girl to me.
- And Shame?
- I want you to enjoy killing Shame.
Gracias, primo.
Ricardo! Julio!
- So, how did you find me?
- Your perfume.
You remembered.
I'm impressed.
You know, Shame...
..you made me break all my rules.
I never meant to hurt you.
- No. Just use me, right?
- It wasn't like that.
Bullshit! l thought you loved me, but you
just used me to get close to Mendoza.
That's a lie and you know it!
Yeah?
Then why did you follow him to Mexico?
Is that what you think?
You think I went to Mexico looking for him?
You think I fucked up my life for him?
I went to Mexico looking for you!
Let go of me.
Why are you telling me this now?
What's done is done. I just want this to be
done with so I can get on with my life.
They'll put you in protective custody.
Testify against Mendoza.
He goes away,
then you start with a clean slate.
You always were late, Shame.
Don't the DEA tell you anything? I've been
in protective custody for six months.
I'd have testified against Mendoza before,
but somebody tipped him off.
He got away just before
the Justice Department moved in.
But Sonny said you came to him.
Oh, shit. It's a set-up. We got to
get out of here. We got to go now!
I need to know
what apartment this woman lives in.
I'm sorry, I can't give...
- Apartment 1504.
- Gracias.
Julio, Tomas, Ricardo, las escaleras.
Sancho, espera aqui.
You said you wanted a blonde.
I'm a blonde.
Can I trust you?
Last time, I wound up naked in a taxi.
- I brought my car... We're being robbed!
- I thought it was my wife.
- Get your hands off my ass.
- Just go with the programme.
Help!
- Hi.
- Hey, baby, what's going on?
Stop!
Get the fuck out! Get out of here!
Wait!
Take the wheel!
Get down!
Motherfucker!
Hold on.
<i>Welcome to Best Burgers.
May l take your order, please?</i>
<i>May I take your order, please?</i>
- Who is it?
- It's me.
- Anyone watching my place?
- Four Mexicans.
- You did what I said?
- I had 'em follow me.
Then I shook their ass like a bowl of Jell-O.
I left them in South Central.
They begging the homies not to kill them.
- Peaches, Angela. Angela, Peaches.
- Hello.
- Where's Wayman?
- Dancing. He won't be back till late.
I gotta go take care of business.
You're not taking me?
See, this is what l'm talking about.
You are sleeping on my skills.
Peaches, I need you to stay here.
Keep your eye on her.
Don't let her out of your sight.
Always want to be James Bond!
Gracias, Tomas.
Get out of the way.
Don't make me slap your fat ass!
What is this shit? You're frisking me?
You gonna fucking frisk me?
Mendoza, I need to talk to you now!
Mendoza, right now!
If he told you to please leave,
I'm saying get the fuck out!
Immigration would give me a fucking medal
if I packed your fucking asses in a truck.
- Why did you come here?
- Why? Your men fucked up, that's why!
If I'd handled it, I'd have found the girl!
But you wanted to play this sick game!
No! Shame started this!
He tried to take my business,
my life and my woman.
This is what this is all about.
A fucking woman!
No. This is about business, Sonny.
Twenty million dollars.
Killing Shame and Angela, that's fun.
I got news for you, Pancho Villa,
or whoever the fuck you think you are!
While you play fucking games,
you're leaving a trail pointing to me.
Man, I'm warning you,
do you know who you're fucking with?
I'm fucking Sonny Rothmiller!
I know every goddamn thing! I'll tell 'em
every contact you got in the States!
I'll name names, dates, places!
Your fucking Texas politicians!
New York! Miami!
Washington.
Are you threatening me, Sonny?
Are you threatening me?
You are a guest in my house.
Show me some fucking respect.
I am simply saying...
..that things are getting a little out of hand.
Maybe you'll let me take care of things
from here on out.
That's a good idea.
I think you should be going now, my friend.
You got a lot of cleaning up to do.
Hey, you were right. My men fucked up.
Sonny? Sonny?
Please, make sure that you don't fuck up.
- I'll take care of it.
- OK.
Hasta la vista.
Blink, and black will be the last thing
you see. We're going for a ride.
<i>- I guess that leaves you and me.
- It's been a bad night all around.</i>
Is there something to eat here?
I suggest you look in the refrigerator.
<i>Don't just stand there, shorty. Get down.</i>
Look at George get down.
That's right, you do that funky chicken.
It's funny. Shame never mentioned you
to me before.
It bothers you he's still in love with me.
What makes you think
he's still in love with you?
I can see it in his eyes. So can you.
So what? OK, Shame might be soft on you.
But I can see
right through all that Maybelline.
And I know you ain't nothing
but a gold-digging skank...
trying to get a man for everything he's got.
But I'll tell you.
Hurt Shame again,
and you better watch your back.
You're so cute.
Protective, even.
You know, Shame used to have this puppy.
Scraggly little thing he found in the gutter.
He was always doing things like that.
The problem with the thing is,
it kept shitting all over the house.
I tried to train it, but it kept shitting.
I put up with it as long as I could,
until one day the bitch snapped at me.
I took her to the vet and put her to sleep.
Are you calling me a dog?
You wanna box, is that it?
You want some of this?
Then let's do it.
All we got to do is push this to the side.
There's nothing but space and opportunity
here. Do you want some?
- I don't have to deal with this shit.
- Then leave. Leave.
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- Get the fuck out.
I don't need this shit.
I'll just tell him she left.
''Shame, she's gone.
She went to get something to eat.''
Shame will kick my ass.
Yo, Ang... Shit!
- What the fuck are we doing here?
- Shut up and sit down.
Why are we here?
It's somewhere two old friends
can talk in private.
Yeah, it's just you and me
and the cockroaches.
What the fuck do you want?
I want Mendoza.
What is it with you? You got a death wish?
You're fucking with the wrong guy.
If you're gonna kill me, do it.
If not, I'm not going to...
- OK.
- What do you mean, ''OK''?
I asked for your help and you said no.
You're free to go.
Son of a bitch.
You motherfucker, Shame.
You're gonna die!
I'm gonna kick your motherfucking ass!
What the fuck is this place?
This is the land of the white man.
We have to reclaim our land.
White power!
White power! White power! White power!
Excuse me!
Could somebody tell me where the exit...is?
You're dead meat!
- He's mine!
- Get the grease ball!
Hey, Luis. You don't look too good, man.
You want a ride?
You crazy motherfucker! Pull over!
Where can I find Mendoza?
Fuck you!
Luis, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.
The good news is,
you're only five miles from East L.A.
The bad news is, it's that way.
OK, man.
He owns a club in Hollywood,
La lsla de Salsa. I'm meeting him there later.
Now pull over, man!
Relax, man.
I know how to handle these people.
Hey, listen up!
Luis says the white man can kiss his ass.
Tell them you're friends with AI Sharpton.
Black power! Black power! Black power!
You bastard! Shame, you motherfucker!
Shame! You can't leave me
on this street alone!
<i>Isn't that cute? An extra belly button!</i>
That looks like Shame.
No, Shame ain't that clean.
Go, Wayman! Get busy!
Get crazy, you've got it!
Go, Wayman! Get busy!
Get crazy, you've got it!
You boys mind if I join your party?
You in the mood for dancing, huh?
You should have called me.
I'd have made you a reservation.
I bumped into Luis.
He told me I could find you here.
- Where is Luis?
- He couldn't make it.
He had a little running around to do.
Let me buy you a drink.
- Marisol!
- Si, senor.
What can I get for you?
What do you suggest?
- Sex On The Beach.
- Give me your number.
I'll see what I can arrange.
I don't think so.
And another glass, please.
Careful, Shame. She's already taken.
But that never stopped you before.
You're not still pissed about that, are you?
No.
Angela was a beautiful woman.
She loved to fuck.
Frankly, Shame, I was surprised
that you fell for a whore like that.
Oh, that was low. That was low.
The funny thing about whores is,
they talk a lot.
Yeah, she told me about your little problem.
Did you get that fixed along with your face?
I'm glad you haven't lost
your sense of humour. Too bad you're a cop.
I really like you.
Really? That's pretty funny.
You know...I never liked you.
Salud.
Back off,
or I will kill this beautiful flower.
I don't give a fuck.
She wouldn't give me her number.
555-6969.
I'm a Scorpio, I love Chinese food!
Call me any time.
I'm going to ease out of here.
Nice and easy.
- I can't let you do that.
- You won't shoot. You're a cop.
Wrong. I'm an ex-cop.
Excuse me, I need to see what's going on.
Shame!
Oh, Lord, I been shot!
Please don't die, Wayman.
Don't die, Wayman. Call a doctor!
Calm down.
Calm down. Wayman, you're fine.
It's not blood, it's just wine.
And the nominees for best actress in a
nightclub drama: Miss Wayman Harrington.
Put the gun down, Shame.
- Should have known I couldn't fool you.
- Well, this is serious.
You're in deep shit. I'm taking you in.
- Where's Angela?
- She left.
- What the fuck do you mean?
- Just like I said.
I went for something to eat.
I came back, she was gone.
- I told you to watch her.
- Why ain't you told her about me?
Are you listening to me?
- I know where she is.
- You're not going anywhere.
Is this who you dressed up for?
You got all dressed up for her?
I look at your raggedy ass every day.
Pocahontas turns up and you get snazzy.
I ain't got time for this shit.
I almost had Mendoza tonight. He's in L.A.
- Mendoza's dead.
- Here's what he looks like.
- Seal off LAX and the bus station.
- You're giving me orders?
Put checkpoints on the highways to Mexico.
I'll look into it, but l'm taking you to jail.
Put Peaches in protective custody
for 24 hours.
- Don't you go.
- Walk out that door and I'll shoot you.
Yeah, yeah. I'll call when I got something.
How you just gonna let him leave like that?
You were supposed to arrest him!
You let him trollop around?
Hey! Now, you, I will shoot!
Get dressed. Let's go.
Well, well, well. What do we have here?
You were gonna open it, right?
Go ahead. Open it.
You said you'd take care of things!
That cowboy almost shot my ass off!
Calm down. I'm on top of everything.
I'm trying to get us a little insurance.
Hey, pull over.
- Who wants popcorn?
- Sounds good.
I'd like some also. Got any toothpicks?
Don't kill me, all right? Just don't hurt me.
- Shut up. Let's go.
- I don't know nothing about this.
All right! I'm not gonna hurt you.
Cross your heart, hope to die?
You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.
- Oh, God. Thank you.
Thank you.
Motherfucker! Want to fuck with me?
I'll smash your fuckin' ass!
You think you're cute?
What the fuck are you gonna do with that?
Come on, you little bitch!
I'm gonna whip your ass now.
Come here, damn it.
I should have shot your ass!
Oh, shit.
Now, you said...that you wouldn't hurt me.
Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'll just throw you through the fucking wall!
Sonny, relax. She's a lady.
I'm Sonny fucking Rothmiller.
You can't fuck with me!
Let me get this straight.
The $20 million in Mendoza's safe
he smuggles here in a coffin.
Then you steal the money
and turn him in to the Feds.
I guess there's no honour
amongst thieves.
You can go straight to hell. All of you can!
How dare you judge me?
I been on my own since I was 12.
Ain't nobody done shit for me.
I saw my chance, I took it.
What were you gonna do with the money?
I don't know, Shame.
Travel. See the world.
Maybe start my own empire.
- Cleopatra.
- What?
You told me when you were young,
you dreamed about being Cleopatra.
You always did listen to me.
Well, you never really stopped talking.
You still make me laugh.
It never would have worked
between you and I.
You never could have given me
what I wanted.
- What was that?
- To be number one in your life.
How would you know that?
You never gave me a chance.
- Yeah.
- Hello, Shame.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
You should take better care of your women.
They might fall into the hands
of another man.
Let me speak to Peaches.
<i>Peaches? You OK?</i>
I'm OK. I'm on the beach!
So now you see, my friend,
I got something you want,
and you got something I want.
So, let's be reasonable.
Name the time and place. I'll be there.
You probably want someplace safe,
out in the open, with lots of people.
<i>How about one of my establishments?</i>
The Palisades Mall, in two hours. Be there.
Yeah, I got it.
Do me a favour. Tell Sonny to come along.
Yeah, sure. Why not?
It will be just like old times.
It's safe, my friend.
Where are we going?
They got Peaches.
- Let's take the money and go.
- I can't do that. She's my friend.
Call the cops. They can handle this.
Mendoza would kill her.
- In time, you'll forget about her.
- Stop it.
We can take this money to an island,
make love under the sun.
- Don't do this to me again.
- Stop it!
What don't you understand?
She's my friend.
I ain't selling her out for you,
for money or for a fuck under the sun.
You got a choice.
Help me put an end to this shit,
or take your chances on your own.
You care about her that much?
Yeah.
OK, Shame. Just promise me
you're gonna smoke his ass.
Like a motherfucking pack of Kools.
Perimeter is secure.
- Your men can handle this?
- These guys are military-trained.
They'll eat Shame alive.
We're not out in ten minutes, they'll storm it.
OK.
Station three is clear.
That's far enough.
So it's like that, Sonny?
- Yeah, it's like that.
- You sold out the whole unit?
This isn't about selling out.
It's about getting paid.
- Good people die so you get paid?
- I was gonna cut 'em all in!
I told them all,
''We can split the money five ways.''
You know what they said?
''Only if Shame was down.''
We both know that wasn't going to happen.
So you made a deal with the devil?
I only got one question, man.
Why didn't you kill me, too?
Somebody had to take the blame.
This is quite a tender moment, guys, but
I'm in a hurry, so can we get on with this?
- Where's my money, Shame?
- The ladies first.
The perfect gentleman.
Peaches...
I hope you're as good as you say you are.
Hello, my sweet. Before I kill you,
we're going to make love one last time.
It's a trick!
Kill her! Kill the girl!
Get them!
Peaches, go now!
I'm going for the money. Everybody dies!
Don't worry. Hit it!
Peaches, we got to split up.
The exit on the top leads to the garage.
Get in my car and wait for me. Go!
- Shame!
- Yeah?
I love you.
I love you, too, Peaches.
Now, get out of here.
Shit!
I'll draw their fire. Give me your gun.
Go. Get out of here.
I'm in front of the Sport Chalet.
This place is full of flammables.
Hold your fire.
Thank you.
Bring in the dogs. Bring them in now!
OK.
Holy shit.
I'm gonna get that sucker.
OK. Think, Shame, think.
Say it loud.
I'm black and I'm proud.
Say it loud.
I'm black and I'm proud.
Ow! Peaches, I love you.
Attack!
I want all the dogs on the left,
throw your heads from side to side.
Dogs on the right, go, ''Ooh, ooh.''
Here we go. Ohh, ooh! Here we go!
Perros! Get him!
Don't move!
Is that the money?
- Yes.
- Step away from it.
What is it about you that makes men crazy?
I don't know.
I guess you'll have to find out for yourself.
Well...
The nectar is uh...tempting, but...
..you're poison.
I think I'll pass.
Suit yourself.
How do you feel now, stupid motherfucker?
You could have had some pussy.
Holy shit! I can't believe I just did that.
Peek-a-boo.
I like you, pequenita. You got a lot of heart.
But your boyfriend is starting to piss me off!
Where is he? Shame!
Shame! Shame!
Get up!
Get up, Mendoza. What's up now?
You talk all that ying-yang. You was looking
for my boyfriend. Here he is.
We about to dig in that ass.
Now you wanna be shy. Huh!
Right, Shame?
I guess I should go wait in the car.
You bad, Shame.
What are you doing on the ground?
Get up. Get up!
My turn.
Let's go. Get up.
I've wanted to tell you this for a long time.
You're under arrest.
Yeah, I think I'm gonna make the bail, man.
Yeah? How you gonna do that?
I got your money.
Let's go.
Angela.
I love you, Shame,
but you won't let me keep the money.
Besides, I told you, I don't like being second.
Bye, baby.
I told you I would drop you where you stand.
You're talking shit.
I thought you were gonna beat my ass!
You want some of this?
Come on!
Yeah! Now, how about that?
That's right, bitch!
Thought I told you to stay in the car.
Thanks, Peaches.
- Come on.
- You know I'm dangerous.
How come the only time I get to touch you
is when you're bruised and bloody?
Are you coming on to me?
You've really done it this time.
Look at this place.
My God, this is gonna cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars!
You had to do it yourself, huh?
There's nothing I can do this time.
You'll take the credit for all of this!
- OK.
- Excuse me?
- I'll take all the credit.
- Credit for what?
For the fatal capture of Ernesto Mendoza,
the discovery of a DEA mole,
the safe return of a federal witness
and $15 million in drug money.
Go on. Go on, get the fuck out of here,
both of you, before I change my mind.
Now, wait a minute, Mr Shame.
Yes, Miss Peaches.
- I thought there was $20 million.
- Well, there was.
But I was hired by a government official,
so I take my fee of 10%.
And, as nobody knew about the $20 million,
that entitles me to a finder's fee of 15%.
And since I'm your assistant,
that entitles me to...
$4.45 an hour.
- Excuse me, Lieutenant Nunez!
- Plus perks and bonuses.
Oh, Shame!
This reminds me of an episode
on ''General Hospital'' with Luke and Laura.
See, Luke was a spy. And right before
the bad guys got him, Laura ran in.
Peaches. Peaches!
Kiss me before I change my mind.
