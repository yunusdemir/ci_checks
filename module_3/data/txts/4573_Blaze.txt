I'm talking about Caesar Chavez.
A man with gumption

The fact of the matter is this,
the world is an organism.
I'm a cell, youse a cell,
he's a cell, she's a cell.
<i>And people like Caesar Chavez</i>
are these super white

all the free radicals.
Wa-ha!

somebody in power like he</i>
we put the big Gipper

"Well, my butthole is a fountain
of divine jelly beans.
- Blaze!
- "We all make a living wage for the deadly po... poor people."
Can he hear me?
Hey? Cowboy!

There's this guy, right?
He's really, really drunk.
He's, like, knee-walkin' drunk.
And, uh, he walks out
of this bar and he, uh
walks right in to
this big old police officer..
And that police officer
goes, "Hey, man"
w... what's going on?"
And he says, "Oh, well, officer,
man, I'm glad I found you."
I lost my car!"
And he says,
"Well, where was your car?"

<i>Welcome back everyone,
this is Country Roads on KYBC.</i>
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
it's an honor</i>
<i>to have with us today,
Townes Van Zandt.</i>
- Thank you.
- <i>Ah, great to have you here.</i>
- Good to be here. Any time.
- <i>Um, New record, "No Deeper Blue."</i>
- That's right.
- <i>Terrific record! Love it.</i>
- Thank you.
- <i>Love the last song, "Blaze's Blues."</i>
- Yep.
- <i>I don't know.</i>
<i>It says it's dedicated
to Blaze Folley.</i>
<i>I don't know
who Blaze Folley is?</i>
It's actually,
it's... it's Blaze Foley.
Uh, it's a blues song.
You should.. You really
should know, who Blaze was.
- "Clay Pigeons?"
- Yeah.
Ah, "If I Could Only Fly?"
Willie and Merle covered.
- Yeah.
- "Our Little Town"?
You can't.. See you can't do..
You can't do this, um, show.
Any kind of show
without a blues song.
<i>Wait. A... are those
Blaze's songs?</i>
- You know "Achy Brakey Heart"?
- <i>Yes!</i>
- Yeah. No, he didn't write that.
- Yeah, he didn't write that.
See, Blaze was a, he was a buddy
of ours, a real buddy.
You know, obviously
a fellow songwriter.
And only went crazy once, Blaze.
Just once. But he stayed there.
He was shot and killed.
<i>Oh.</i>
Some, some punk kid in Austin.
I think he lives out west now.
Well, the kid was trying to
steal his dad's disability check
and, uh, Blaze decided he
he wasn't gonna let that happen.
He tried to, he tried to do
something about it
and then he took a bullet
in the gut for it.
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>"There are a great many things
a man cannot understand."</i>
"Any girl would rather love an
unfortunate man than a fortunate one"
"because every girl.."
"Would like to do something
by loving."
<i>"A man has his work,
so for him love"</i>
<i>"is always kept
in the background."</i>
"To talk to his wife"
<i>"and walk with her in the garden"</i>
"and to pass
the time... pleasantly with her"
"that is all
that love means to a man."
"But... but for us.."
"love.."
"means life.
"I love you.
<i>"That means that I dream only</i>
<i>"of how I can cure you</i>
<i>"of your sadness.</i>
"If... if you are in heaven,
then I am in heaven
"if you are in the pit,
then I am in the pit.
"If you are in the pit.. If you are
in the pit then I am in the pit.
"For instance it would be, for instance,
it would be the greatest happiness for me
"to stay up all night

"to stay up all night writing

<i>"Or to watch all night..</i>
"that no one should wake you.
"I remember that three years ago
at threshing time.."
Ah..
Excuse me? Sorry, hi.
Uh, would you mind
stopping the work
just for like two more minutes
until I get through this speech?
<i>Thank you so much.</i>
"When I, when I brought you
a glass of water.."
"You were already lying
on the sofa"
"and sleeping like a dead man."
<i>"You slept there for half
a day, and all that time.</i>
<i>"I watched by the door
to make sure</i>
<i>"that no one should disturb you.</i>
"The more a girl can do,
the greater her love can be.
<i>I mean, that is,
the more she feels it."</i>
Okay, I'm done.
<i>Thank you.</i>
I think I was better
when you were working.
I got nervous when you stopped.
<i>More, more nervous.</i>
Well, I'll never stop.
<i>Alright, listen,
I think we should start</i>
<i>with "Big Cheeseburgers
And Good French Fries"</i>
- "Let Me Ride In Your Big Cadillac."
- No, no, no, no.
And we're doing
a ton of songs in A.
I think we should make sure to revert
every... every third to C or E.
Oh, shut up, Zee. He's just gonna
shake 'em and he's gonna roll.
<i>- And my friend had to leave town for.. For 18 years.
- Fuck Townes.</i>
I hooked Blaze up
with this guy Phil.
He's costin' a shit ton of money
and we only get two hours tape.
We can't have him gettin' drunk
and reading off the back
of tampon packages.
As funny as that is.
His brother owned the rights
to all the..
No, but I mean seriously, if I
ran us off the road right now
and this exploded, none of these
songs would even fucking exist.
<i>Just drop me off at Will's.</i>
<i>"Drop me off at Will's."
Where the fuck you going?</i>
<i>Is only giving Blaze
the gig because of you.</i>
<i>It's like rain.</i>
Rain doesn't try and fall.
It just falls,
because it's rain.
Okay?
So, it's the same with acting.
- <i>Leave me alone!</i>
- You don't try and act...
<i>I don't need your help!</i>
- Ah.
- <i>He's got a gun!</i>
- What?
- <i>He's got a gun!</i>
He's got a gun! Run!
He's got a gun!
Fuck me!
He's got a gun, scatter!
Scatter!
<i>Who has a gun?</i>
<i>You know that skinny guy
that does the lights?</i>
<i>- Doug?
- Yeah.</i>
He's got a uh..
14-year-old hayseed girl
up in his room.
So me and some of the guys
went up there
because that didn't sound
very good.
Trying to make sure everything's
on the up and up.
Turns out the fucking guy
is nuts.
I guess I should've known.
You know what they say.
No, what do they say?
Never stand in the way
of true love.
I'm Sybil by the way.
I'm Deputy Dawg.
No, you're not.
Deputy Dawg?
You like Blaze better?
What's your real name?
It was Mike Fuller, but, uh
I ditched that
when I lost 150 pounds.
You lost 150 pounds?
You wanna see my stretch marks?
Is that your best line?
<i>Ah! Nope.</i>
My best line, "Picture cards
can't picture you."
How'd you lose all that weight?
Thorazine.
Where'd you get that, uh,
that limp from?
I had polio.
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I was only eight months old.
I've been an oddball ever since.
I never could run or dance
or play any of
the reindeer games.
In high school..
I was the only Jewish person
so they used to invite me into
classes for show and tell.
Well..
Odd ducks unite!
I'm shy. I don't know why.
All wild things are shy.

<i>At his funeral, we, uh</i>
<i>we duct taped
his casket together.</i>
<i>- Yeah, we sure did. Didn't we?
- Yeah.</i>
<i>Well, he was buried with
everything he owned.</i>
Which didn't really
add up to nothing.
- No. A Reagan mask, some pigs!
- But, do you know what?
He, uh..
This was his guitar. Right here.
<i>He gave it to you?</i>
I bought it for him.
I bought it for him.
- You did?
- Yeah.
You see, Blaze he... he, uh..
He was really popular
at the pawn shop.
Almost famous at the pawn shop.
He, he ended up
borrowing more guitars
than he ever actually played.
<i>After the funeral I heard</i>
<i>that it might be
at this one shop.</i>
<i>- The guitar?
- This guitar.</i>
<i>So I went over there
and sure enough, there it was.</i>
<i>And, uh.. But, you know..</i>
<i>I told the guy, I said, "Hey, man,
that's... that's my buddy's guitar."</i>
And you know he gave it to me. He
actually willed it to me. Which he did!
<i>But he wasn't giving away
nothing.</i>
<i>He wanted 1800 bucks for it.</i>
<i>So we all knew
that Blaze only had one coat</i>
and I was pretty sure that that
pawn slip was gonna be in that coat.
So, one night after the funeral
we got thinking about it and, uh
drinking about it
maybe a little bit
and me and Al Minus and, uh..
Crazy Kerkin you know,
some, I'm not really sure.
When was this?
You weren't there, but..
I just pretty much decided
I was gonna go over there
and I was gonna dig him up
to get, to get that pawn slip.
<i>And that's what I did.</i>
<i>I went over there
and I dug him up</i>
<i>cut through that duct tape</i>
<i>opened it up</i>
<i>and sure enough, there it was.</i>
<i>Right there
in that breast pocket.</i>
His pawn slip.
I'll tell you something else
about that.
When I got it open
he was grinnin'.
Like laughin'.
So now it's my guitar.
<i>Only one drink, big dog.
That's the limit.</i>
<i>I don't want any shenanigans
from you tonight.</i>
<i>No fights.
No belligerent bullshit.</i>
<i>- No, no, he's...
- You got it?</i>
<i>It's none for him.
He's sober. Give his to Concho.</i>
<i>Damn right!</i>
<i>- Blaze sober? Bullshit.
- Yeah.</i>
<i>He's clean as a the house too.</i>
- Where's Townes?
- Oh, he's, uh, he had to make a stop.
- He's right behind us. He's coming.
- Uh-huh.
I'm breaking so many promise to
myself letting you play again.
Don't make me regret it.
Fuck!
What an asshole.
- Hmm.
- You good?
Sneak me a Dr. Pepper
and a squirt of amber in it.
Nah. You got this. You got this.
<i>Check, check, check. Alligator,
alligator, alligator, gah.</i>
<i>You rollin'?</i>
<i>Okay, good people.</i>
<i>I've got every last dollar

<i>spinnin' 'round those

<i>So I'm gonna do my best
not to do too much.</i>
<i>Johnny Carsonin'
or Chatty Cathyin'</i>
<i>just gonna play every song I,
I can think of I guess.</i>
Will that mean we're gonna be
on the album if I shout a ton?
<i>Yes, I suppose it does!</i>
Hey, Jake, we're
gonna be on the album!
Welcome home!
<i>Fuck you!</i>
Hey! When's Townes comin'?
He's comin' when he's coming.
Spring bird.
You know spring bird!
Springers! You've got to know
some springers.
Ever feel like you're not
gonna be alive much longer?
<i>Ha! With the way you live,
that's not much of a premonition.</i>
That's wishful thinkin'.
<i>Well..</i>
<i>If I was to go up
and see the Big Spender.</i>
<i>That's what I call the man
upstairs, The Big Spender.</i>
<i>'Cause he, or she,
is one generous being.</i>
<i>You want a light? Zap!</i>
<i>Here's a star on fire.</i>
<i>You like flowers?</i>
<i>Here's ten million

<i>You want music?

<i>You don't dig on the fancy

<i>Yeah, I suppose
if I was to check out early</i>
<i>and go and meet the Big Spender.</i>
<i>I'd be sad I never got to meet
Merle Haggard</i>

<i>So, ladies and gentleman's</i>
<i>this deal tonight,

<i>Say hi to Merle, folks.</i>
- Hey, Merle!
- Howdy, Merle!
- Hey, Merle.
- Hey, Merle.
You know, I bet
old Merle's been in love.
Well, I's been in love too.
This one's called "Picture Cards

<i>Ain't that right?</i>
You see it's not that primitive.
It's got, you know..
Running water.
<i>Man, we sure do appreciate
the offer.</i>

What's the,

Well..
Stars burn out 'cause
they shine for themselves.
Look at me shine,
look at me glow.
I'm amazing.
Legend lasts forever.
A legend stands for something.
Something that matters,
you know?
Well, do you think
that's possible?
You... you could live forever?
People can't, but a song can.
It's just a matter of time.
All of a sudden
I have no idea what to sing.
<i>You know any Neil Young?</i>
<i>When is Townes comin'?</i>
<i>Why don't you play the first
song you ever wrote?</i>
The first song I ever wrote?
Man, I wouldn't play that song
to myself sitting in the dark.
Stupid little song about living
in a tree house in the woods.
I wrote that song for a..
A beautiful little Jewish gal
with kinky hair.
Thought that song
would last forever.
Just like every time,
I'm... preparing a scene
it's like... I have all
these ideas of how I wanna do it
and then..
When I actually have to do it
or if there's somebody
watching me..
It's not even like stage
fright, it's just like..
The ease of it
kinda leaves my body. You know?
- And..
- <i>Mm.</i>
After every time, it's like
it's never as good
as I know it can be.
I don't know, I guess it's just,
like, confidence or something
I just don't feel like I'm giving
it all the energy I actually have.
I wanted to be, like, free and
not questioning what I'm doing
but I'm always questioning it.
Where do you think
confidence comes from?
<i>I don't know.
Thinking you're the best?</i>
That's not real confidence.
Can I tell you
where I think it comes from?
<i>Mm-hm, okay.</i>
I think confidence
is a consolation prize
for knowing that you're alive.
I do.
Some years back,
you weren't even here.
And now you're here.
- <i>Mm.</i>
- Couple years, you won't be here again.
<i>Knowin' that you're here's...
kind of a rarity as a human being.</i>
It seems too simple
but it's true I think.
Next time you're on stage
remember, you got a heart
beatin' in your chest..
There's lungs filling up
with air.
All that stuff is really
happenin'.
<i>All these little melodramas
people make up for themself</i>
<i>they don't mean anything.</i>
<i>I think that's the way it is.</i>
You have it though.
I've seen it.
<i>Yeah, as long as you're around.</i>
That's not true.
You have it when you're walking
across the room.
And you fill other people
with it
because you remind them
that they're alive.
Bet you didn't know that?
<i>No, I didn't.</i>
Well, now you do.
Now, please discard.
I'm ready, there!
Can I take another one?
<i>- No!
- Okay.</i>
<i>It's my turn!</i>
<i>That night,
the night he died, uh..</i>
We recorded a live record..
At, uh..
It was The Outhouse.
Is Townes coming or not?
Maintain Jennifer, he's comin'.
<i>Yo!</i>
I often find myself thinking on
where does a song come from?
A real song.
You know what I mean?
He's told me not to come here.
<i>'Cause the good ones, they
just sort of arrive on time.</i>
<i>There we go.</i>
<i>Like, uh... where was it?</i>

<i>You can't imagine the world

<i>It's like babies maybe.</i>

Maybe it can.

<i>See, it was just like his songs</i>
<i>there was two kinds of Blaze.</i>
<i>Some folks met one</i>
<i>some folks met the other one.</i>
<i>And one of 'em
was just plain wild.</i>
Lots of folks knew that one.
But now the other one,
that one was different.
He was big,
he was kind and gentle.
But sometimes
he could get bitter.
<i>I keep thinkin' about
people 20 years from now..</i>
<i>Jim wants me to deliver
that shit today.</i>
Shit. I imagine
they'd be lookin' at him.
Asshole. What?
Well..
Listen, honey, just..

Little Lord Fauntleroy?
Maybe he's just thinkin'
who the hell is this fool

<i>You know, you'd never know
by lookin' at him.</i>
But he was a spiritual,
almost righteous.
I guess you could say
he took a vow of poverty
and saw everything
through that lens.
You know, I used to fish
the White River with my father.
<i>I don't know when I'm gonna be
back. I just..</i>
One spring I was
fishin' with him and I said,
"Daddy, is this the same water
we was ridin' on last summer?"
I mean, is this water
that we're motivatin'
on the same water... from before?
I told you I was gonna pick some
shit up for Jim! I gotta drop it off!
He just shook his head
looked at me,
with some bait on his hook.
'Cause I put 20 bucks in the damn
drawer is how you can order it!
That's when I realized
grown folk don't know shit.
<i>I can't sit here and talk

- Uh-huh.
- <i>Blaze.</i>
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Why don't you bring your ass up
here, ZZ Top?
Blaze, come on.
Fucking piece of shit.
<i>One time we'd been up
for like a week..</i>
Writing.
<i>I was finally trying
to fall asleep.</i>
<i>Blaze just stumbles
into the room</i>
and he's, like,
mumbling something.
He, he told me
he was trying to meditate.
<i>What?</i>
Yeah.
He, he just kept..
Saying this, like, Buddhist
prayer over and over again
he was just like,
staring at the wall.
What, like a mantra?
But then all of a sudden
there was this..
Explosion in the room.
Like the room exploded
with this bright white light
and it felt like
something, like..
It was like somethin'
that hasn't made it
its way into a book.
<i>And from this feeling
of genuine love</i>
this Buddha-like
character appeared.
And he went to the door
and he opened the door
and there was even a bigger
explosion of light
and in walks Jesus.
<i>And Jesus tells Blaze</i>
that you never turn your back
on your family.
Did he say it that in Aramaic?
Yeah, something like that.
Regardless of what you worship
or how you worship..
You can't..
You can't lose,
you can't strip away these
these symbols
that you're raised with.
They become part of you like..
Like blood.
<i>Hell fucking no.</i>
No, no, no, no, no.
Hell fucking no.
Here's what I'm saying is
Blaze didn't have to look east
to see the light.
The light is with us.
I think the two of you
were drinking
or something for a week,
and if I remember correctly
<i>you had to pull a pistol on him
to get him out of your bedroom.</i>
What I'm saying is
that, uh, he was, um..
He was open
to that kind of experience.
That doesn't mean
that I think he could handle it.
Goddammit, why'd you take your hands
down to the goddamn hole in the wall.
Because they won't let you in.
I let you in and you come in
you asked me to come in
and goddammit
I let you in and you fuck it up!
- I'm real sorry about that.
- <i>I'm gonna tear your ass down..</i>
Look, I care for the man.
I care for him.
Six... six hundred.
Let's just, let us finish this.
Now, come on.
I'm just sick and fucking tired
of people getting hurt in my bar.
- Don't you understand?
- Oh, come on.
- It's over.
- Please?
Goddammit. Son of a mother
fucking bitch.
That was embarrassing.
You alright?
I think so.
Okey-dokey, smoky-pokey.
This next song
is my wedding song.
If J.T.'s alright with it and
they're still not too mad at me.
<i>I'd love to have the Outhouse family
come up here and play some music with us.</i>
Jodie, Nassie and Dave.
If y'all feel inclined.
Come on up here
and play this song.
<i>This song's called "Big
Cheeseburgers And Good French Fries."</i>
<i>It's not like playing up a tree
house free as a squirrel.</i>
<i>But looky here now, I'm just
standing here playing for Merle.</i>
That rhyme to.
There's a little sucker thing
going round and around.
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Hey!
- How you been?
- I'm doing good.
Well aren't you the cutest
fucking thing I've ever seen?
<i>You feel confident that they're prepared
to have a Bigfoot in their house?</i>
- There's nothing to worry about.
- <i>Sam!</i>
<i>- Sam, come on. They're here! She's here!
- Let's go, let's go.</i>
Thanks for the tea,
uh, Mrs. Rosen.
I wish I could
still drink coffee.
Coffee does wonders
for my noodle hub
but wreaks havoc
down in my spaghetti house.
It's just a mess, you know?
<i>Blaze, don't you think Sybil
has a nice nose?</i>
Oh, Ms. Rosen, we Pentecostals
don't go in for noses.
Having said that, as far as noses go,
that's one of the finest noses I knows.
So you guys been married
for a long time?
Oh, we've been married forever.
<i>Y'all's got that
old-fashioned love.</i>
That's what I want for Tsibila.
Setsibila? What is Setsibila?
Tsi... Tsibila. It means
a little onion in Yiddish.
Little onion. So youse my little
sweet Vidalia Onion?
Gonna eat you for breakfast
with my hot potato.
Are you kidding me?
Ugh, Mom!
Sorry.
Can, uh..
Can we talk to one
another... honestly?
Yeah. That would be nice.
Sybil..
I think you brought this man
home to meet your family
because... you are in love
with him
<i>and you are considering
marriage and children.</i>
<i>Is that right?</i>
Yeah.
We are a Jewish family.
<i>Yes.</i>
If we have grandchildren,
we would want them to be Jewish.
- I got it.
- I noticed you haven't asked for Sybil's hand.
Is that somethin' you were
planning on doing?
Yeah. Yeah, it was.
Well, now would be a great time
for that I think.
<i>- Now?
- Dad.</i>
Jeanette?
Could you come on
back in here, please?
No, no, Dad, Dad.
Please. Let's not be ridiculous,
okay?
If Blaze wants to marry me
we have to talk about it first.
Of course
I respect the past, but..
The past has a lot
of ugliness to it
that I think we're all trying
to change in the future.
I don't want to spend my life
cleaning up some man's socks
and I definitely don't want
to be handed out
as if I am something
that's owned.
If Blaze wants my hand,
he has to ask me.
And if I say yes, then,
we will ask for your blessing.
And if you don't give it to us,
we'll do it anyway.
But if Blaze does decide
to convert to Judaism
your mother and I, and we
haven't discussed this
but I'm certain we agree
if he does convert, your mother
and I will cover the costs.
Of course, we will.
That's good to know.
That's good to know for sure.
Blaze, is your faith important
to you?
Is my faith important to me?
I'm not dead positive
I know what you mean..
Your identity as a Christian
is that fundamental
to your integrity?
I got ya.
Mr. Rosen, Christianity didn't
do much more than kick my ass
every day including Sunday.
<i>It taught me to sing, but, uh...</i>
the Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away, so...
No, not terribly important.
That would be a <i>nay.</i>
Well, see, that's
very helpful for me to know.
<i>Say, I got a question?</i>
Was Zero Mostel really Jewish?
From "Fiddler On The Roof?"
Yeah, yeah.
I believe so.
In fact, I think
he was raised orthodox.
Yeah.
Hot dog.
I love Zero Mostel.

You know, when I first met
Blaze, um...
he was gettin' a divorce
I think.
Uh, nobody knows who,
who she was or is or..
I think she was like half
Jewish, half black girl.
She wasn't black.
Uh, I don't remember her name,

- <i>You guys want some coffee?</i>
- Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You guys could make
a living at this.
<i>Yep, well, we do.</i>
<i>You guys,
uh, drink a lot of coffee</i>
<i>when you guys on the road
like this?</i>
Oh, yeah. I guess you have to.
Keeps us going.
I didn't start drinking coffee
until I was a teenager.
My father loved coffee almost
as much as he liked liquor.
<i>One summer, we was painting
the side of the house.</i>
So he had me down on doing
the low bit
he was doing the high bit.
Anyway, he fell on his face.
Broke his jaw in three places.
- Is this a true story?
- This is a true story.
This is a true story.
I was probably nine years old.
And he was in the hospital
for three days
and I went to visit him
on the second day.
He was just... you know
anxious and shaking,
and his jaw was wired shut.
And he was, like, and I said,
"How you doing, Daddy?"
He said "I'm doing alright,
apart from the fact"
"that I need a drink
and a cup of coffee
"and they won't let me have
liquor inside the hospital.
But they said
I could have coffee."
And I'm waiting to find out how.
So the nurse came in.
Nurse comes in and says,
"Mr. Fuller.
"I really have to apologize
to you
the only way we can do this
is an enema."
<i>Oh, no.</i>
And he said,
"I don't care what you do
I just want you to get
my coffee."
So I said, "Should I leave?"
He said, "No."
So she came in. She..
And I promise you, it's true..
Turned him on his side.
<i>And he says,
"Son, hold my hand."</i>
I said, "Alright."
I held his hand and he looked
at me and she said.
"I'm going to put in
the hose now, Mr. Fuller.
Take a deep breath.
Took a deep breath."
"Oh! Shit!
You put the thing up
where it shouldn't be."
<i>She rolled this thing in</i>
they had hot coffee
up in that IV bag.
- <i>Hot coffee?</i>
- Hot coffee..
They just gone and pour
that thing.
And she released the valve
on that thing
and said, "Take a deep breath."
He said, "Oh! Shit!"
Oh, God almighty."
And she said, "What's the matter,
Mr. Fuller? Is it too hot?"
And he said,
"No! It's too sweet!"

every human being person's

<i>And we got to sit there

and gather up these sparks

all around us.
<i>And they are flying around us
all the time.</i>
No denying that, believe me.
I try to gather up these sparks
and turn 'em into songs.
<i>We can all sit
in our own little dark room</i>
and gather up these sparks
<i>and form them into
a perfect key.</i>
<i>Voila.</i>

This is a real big deal
for us, man.
<i>We've been wanting to do this
for a long while</i>
<i>and it's a real good experience.</i>
<i>I couldn't help but think through
the whole recording process</i>
<i>about the old fable
about the songbird for whom</i>
which sang the swamp choir.
Are you familiar with that?
<i>There's this beautiful songbird</i>
<i>for whom sang
in this swamp choir.</i>
<i>He used to rehearse
on this little cypress tree</i>
<i>and he was up there
rehearsin' one day.</i>
<i>They had a big swamp recital
coming up.</i>
He sang a really pretty song and this bullfrog
comes up and starts watching him singing.
Songbird looked down and said, "Bullfrog,
you liked that song I'm singing?"
The bullfrog looked up
and said, "Ahhh."
<i>Songbird said, "Well if
you don't like that song.</i>
<i>I'll sing you
an even better song."</i>
<i>So he sang another song
and yes indeed</i>
<i>this song was twice as good
as the first one.</i>
He finished up the song,
he looked down at the bullfrog
and he said, "Bullfrog,
what you think about that song?"
Once again the bullfrog looked
up and he said, "Ahhhh."
<i>Songbird said, "Damn!
I was singing my best song."</i>
<i>He took a deep breath and he sang one of the
most beautiful songs the frog had ever heard.</i>
<i>In fact, it was the most beautiful
song the whole swamp had ever heard.</i>
<i>It went on and on and at the end
of it this high note was held.</i>
<i>The songbird stretched his
neck, his gullet up to the sky.</i>
And he hit that
final crescendo and..
<i>Heart gave up.</i>
Songbird fell dead.
And as he fell
that bullfrog looked up
and said, 'Ahhh.'
And swallowed the songbird.
<i>The bullfrog felt pretty bad about
that, he wandered over to the river.</i>
<i>And he went to see the band leader,
which was a big old fat raccoon.</i>
He said, "Hey, man, I'd like to sing 'The
Revival Of The Night' if that's possible?"
<i>The raccoon looked him up and
down and said, "Bullfrog..</i>
<i>Can you even sing?"</i>
The bullfrog said, "Nope,
but I gots it in me!"
Well, that's the strangest damn
joke I ever heard.
<i>Gotta say, Blaze,
we're pumped, man.</i>
- Hell, yeah!
- Whoo!
Looking good, looking forward to
the gig in New York.
<i>The first time that I ever met
Blaze was in New York City</i>
<i>at the Lonestar Cafe.</i>

for Kinky.

titty tassels

<i>Yes, sir!</i>

don't you just, uh, hunker down?

Well, sing us a song
give us one of them
long wise intros you do.
Well, it just so happens
that's my specialty.
Hey, can I ask you too?
Well, would you mind..
Can we do "Miss Carousel?"
<i>I'm sorry, I just..</i>
I don't know what it is
about that song, but, I..

<i>And everything's just goin'</i>

way in the back of the hall</i>
you see this dude
standing back there.
He's the only guy standing up.
<i>So you keep the show going,
doing some songs</i>
you're talking to the people,
then all of a sudden
he starts to move
a little bit closer.
It's just as soon as he gets
right up to the stage, huh?
So when he starts to reach
into the inside of his jacket..
Oh..
<i>You know, I always think of
this same thing every time.</i>
Jesus, Lord,
I hope that's a gun.

For backing me up in there.
Mm. No place to fall, man.
- Oh, I love that song.
- No place to fall.
- Oh, yeah?
- I love that song.
Did you write the whole thing?
Let's say you're at a party
and, uh..
The party's goin' on..
And you're sittin' on
the window sill, just talkin'.
And then, uh..
You just start wonderin'
like, what it would..
What would it be like... you know
to fall.
I mean, like, really fall.
And if you don't do it,
you're not gonna know.
So the next,
you're just fallin' back.
I mean, you just fall.
War stories. Have you ever
fallen on you back?
Now you know how it feels.
You remember the adrenaline.
- You remember everything about it.
- Yeah. Yeah.
You see, people are gonna think
that, like, you're an idiot
or you're crazy.
You know, like, Sally,
you know somethin'
that they don't know.
I got a confession to make.
I'm not really a doctor.
Really?
I mean I said all that stuff
and I think y'all believed me
and then I just went with it
and now I'm feelin' bad
about it.
'Cause it was a, it was a,
it was a lie.
Oh, honey, that's okay.
- Oh, Dr. Cinnamon Bun.
- Are you sure?
Youse the only doctor
that I ever need.
You made me feel a lot better.
Thanks.
Ah, well. The doctor's in.
- Hey, man?
- Yeah.
Did I tell you I met John Prine
the other day?
We're gonna write a song
called "Squirrel"
'cause when I told him
I used to live in a tree house
he said, "Well, you must be
a squirreling motherfucker."
- Yeah.
- Man, that's up.
So I'm gonna write this song
called "Squirrel"
about a squirrel like me.
And a squirrel lady called
Little Onion
and this cat called the world
has got a .22 squirrel rifle
and he's gotta aim
to shoot those squirrel legs.
But you know what I says to him?
What'd you say?
Get all up over me!
Get all up over me.
Come on. Come on, get my ass.
Exactly.
What you think about that?
Well, squirrelly, I think
you better just protect
your nuts and
watch what y'all doin'.

Oh, my love..

I say the mark of my love
is the best part of me.
You mind it all.
I remember my daddy, uh..
Kickin' me with
those nasty old cowboy boots.
He's always cursing me
like that.
Even when he wanted
cheeseburgers
it sounded like curses.
<i>I can see him with my...
my little boy eyes lookin' up.</i>
<i>He's just wailin' on me.</i>
But it don't hurt.
It just feels like sand poundin'
on a grave digger.

Great God Almighty,
baby, you've found me.
You dug me up.
I don't know why you did,

You did it with your voice.
And your eyes.
And your lips..
And your intelligence.
And I'm not even talkin'

You've got such goodness in you.

No, but seriously.
Why do we forget?
Plain old livin' I imagine.
I'm scared.
What's you scared of?
I'm scared

I feel like we're living

I'm smart enough

But I don't know

so, uh, maybe I'll stop playin'
it, so he can rest in peace.
