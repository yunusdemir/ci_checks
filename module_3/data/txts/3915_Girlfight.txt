Don't lie to me.
I know that something is up.
Why dowe have to keep talking
about this?. It's over.
Look, he's not all that anyway.
- But I like him.
- Marisol, it's a free country.
Just becauseyou have a crush on him
doesn't mean you own him.
You didn't even notice him
until you found out I liked him.
- Please. Get overyourself.
- It's true.
You could have any boyyou want
in this school, and you choose him.
Look, nothing happened.
Okay?.
Can we be friends now?.
You fucked him.
I did not.
You're lying.
You had sex with him?.
Guzman, you suck.
It didn't mean anything to me. Ifhe
prefers me overyou, is that my problem?.
Maybe it's time
you took a look in the mirror.
It's time for a makeover.
Apologize to her.
- Excsue me?.
- You heard me. Sayyou're sorry.
Yeah, right.
Come on, girls, let's bounce.
I'm telling you,
that bitch is psycho.
Get off me, you fuckin' bitch!
Jesus.
American Gladiators.
Show's over.
You kids are late for class.
You're fucking crazy, Guzman!
- You started it, you fuckin' bitch!
- Enough!
- She's lying!
- Yo, Tiny, checkyour sister!
- You know whatyou did.
- Both ofyou are at fault.
- I didn't do nothing!
- Except beyour stinky, skanky self.
I said hustle, or all ofyou
end up in detention!
Report after school,
oryou're suspended.
Seeyou.
You are another story.
Now come on.
This is your fourth fight
this semester.
You simply can't continue
to behave like this.
Haveyou ever considered
how much more effective it would be...
to talk aboutyour disagreement?.
You have a serious problem.
In or out of school, your life
is only gonna get harder because ofit.
You might want us to find someone
who can helpyou deal with this.
I don't need any help.
Fine. It's up toyou.
I am out of options.
One more fight,
and you're expelled.
Who cares ifI'm expelled?.
Diana, askyourself
that question.
Up the ante. Up.
- Money on the wood.
- Hey there, it's Diana.
Oh, yeah,
the gym's probably closed by now.
- I got held up at school.
- You in trouble again?.
Here. Tell Hector I'll have
the rest for him next week.
Not after this game.
- Where am I going?.
- Take the 61 to York.
It's near the water.
Whyyou sending your girl
down there?.
'Cause she's paying Hector.
My good man from Panama's training Tiny.
Man, you're the living likeness
ofyour mother.
- I was just saying--
-Just play.
Later.
You need some variety.
I give it toyou.
I'm looking for Hector.
The ring in the back.
The right, Tiny.
Rememberyour combinations, Tiny.
- Last round.
- You said we go to four.
He's not ready.
Not ready, huh?.
Where the hell's Don?.
- What's up?.
- You better keepyour eye on this bozo.
- He don't listen to a word I say.
- Well, make him listen.
What the fuck?.
That's my brother, you little shit.
Let me go!
I'm gonna get her!
I gotta putyou in a cage?.
- The ho hit me first.
- I mean that crap in the ring.
It's embarrassing. Being beaten twice
in a day makes me look like a pussy.
Hey, watch your mouth.
- Why'd you mess with Ray like that?.
- He's a punk, Tiny.
- We were sparring.
- It didn't look that way to me.
Here, this is from my dad.
You Sandro's kid too?.
- How come I never heard aboutyou?.
- I don't know. I'm his pride and joy.
Jesus Christ.
Nice meeting you.
Yeah.
You been humiliated.
You fight dirtywith a little kid.
Then you got slaped by a little girl.
That's weak, Ray.
The bitch is lucky
I didn't kill her.
- You spared her some mighty force, huh?.
- That's right.
Who's the dish?.
Should have me a taste
and find out.
Little man.
- You know I was just playin', right?.
- I know.
Can we shake?.
Thoughtyou had a friend.
Come on, man.
Hey, killer.
I forgiveyou too.
- Oh, yeah?.
- Yeah.
I mean, I guess you never
learned how to be a lady.
You shouldn't hit people
like that.
I couldn't resist.
Tiny, let's go.
Got that scholarship application
I told you about.
- For that art school?.
- Yeah. It's cool.
You gotta learn all kinds ofstuff
beforeyou can do anywork.
You know,
to get a foundation.
You would think that's cool.
Sounds like
a waste oftime to me.
Learn how to draw.
What's that gonna getyou, Tiny?.
A job painting somebody's house
out in Long Island somewhere?.
Maybe.
Edward clean you out
like he said he would?.
Yeah, well, he screws himself
when he talks like that.
I'm not finished.
I know.
So, how was school, champ?.
It was okay.
Lots of excitement.
When I was a kid,
school was so boring...
I thought I'd piss in my pants
waiting to get out in the world.
So, did it happen?.
What?.
Did you get out in the world?.
What kind of question is that?.
Dad.
It's Ms. Martinez.
When?.
No, she didn't mention it.
Yes.
Yeah.
Okay.
Whyyou always gotta
fuck up like this, huh?.
Veronica asked for it.
You embarrass me. Sometimes
I don't even thinkyou're mine.
Maybe I'm notyour kid.
That better be cleaned up
by the time I come back.
Ifl was enough ofa skeez,
I could pull that off.
Whywould you want to?.
Veronica say anything toyou?.
Yeah, if she wants
to choke on her teeth.
Always with
that damn mirror ofhers.
" Let me get made up just perfect
so I can suckyour dick...
which is all I'm good for
anyway."
- Let it rest with her already.
- How come?.
Because she can be bitchy,
but that's not all she's about.
- Some fucking loyalty.
- Don't be like that.
She treats you like shit.
WHy take her side?.
Diana, I don't take sides.
Veronica don't even mean
halfthe stuff she says.
Look, I just wanna be friends
with everybody. That's the way I am.
Yeah, well, I hate her,
and that's the way I am.
Set his wife on fire,
then fatallyshot himself.
Neighbors ofthe slain woman
expressedshock andsorrow today as--
Knock knock.
I t was open.
You here to beat me up?.
Remember her from the other day?.
The bare knuckles.
You should've seen Ray's face.
Hey, I'm trying to say something.
I wanna train with you.
I wanna be a boxer.
Sure.
It's a great workout.
No, for real.
I wanna fight.
- You can train, butyou can't fight.
- Why not?.
You just can't.
Girls don't have
the same power as boys.
Why not aerobics?.
Am I talking toyou?.
Nice.
There's plenty ofthings you can do
betterwith your life than box.
Prove it.
You got money?.
'Cause I don't work for free.
A little.
I charge $1 0 a session,
and that's cut-rate.
I don't have
that kind of cash.
Well, thereyou go.
- Dad?.
- Hmm?.
You know howyou pay forTiny
to train with Hector?.
Well, I was thinking on
how that's like an allowance.
and I should get one too.
It's not an allowance.
Then what is it?.
I'm preparing him
for the world out there.
- Yeah, but--
- Look, it's insurance.
These kids are gonna
eat him alive.
- That's not true.
- Tiny, it is true.
What ifhe doesn't want to box?.
Sure, he wants to.
What kid wouldn't?.
He could go to college, Dad. He could
do all sorts of stuffwith himself.
You think I don't know that?. You think
this is just spending moneyfor him?.
He ain't over at A&S Plaza buying
lipstick orwhateveryou girls do there.
Please. Don't front like I'm some
girly-girl when you know I'm not.
Would it kill you
to wear a skirt once in a while?.
Look, your mother
was a receptionist...
in a very nice office.
You want some extra money,
get a job.
I ain't giving you anything
until you show meyou deserve it.
It's not likeyou
give me anything anyway.
You think I don't hearyou?.
Shut up, already.
Stop doing that.
You again.
Relax.Jab.Jab.
What areyou doing here?.
- I got the money.
- I didn't promise nothing.
You said
once I got the cash.
You seem like a nice kid.
It's just not right.
Diana--
This is bullshit. You said
once I got the money, and now I do.
Wait a minute.
You're gonna train with Hector?.
Yeah.
- Why?.
- Why not?.
Well, what about Papi?.
- You tell Dad, and I'll kill you.
- Take it easy!
Please.
I'll train you.
You will?.
Ifyou don't sweat for me,
you're out of my life. Got it?.
- Got it.
- Oh, man!
Tiny, come on.
Fuck.
Now he hates me.
Rule number one--
no personal business in the gym.
Watch me.
Hands close toyour body,
hands up toyour face.
Jab. Snap, snap.
Springs back toyou.
Snap, snap,
springs back toyou.
Twist it.
Now throw the right.
Soon you won't think
whileyou're doing this.
You'll be daydreaming.
What's that, huh?.
What's that?.
You got no balance that way.
Better.
Nothing stays still in the ring.
Move around the bag more.
Watch your footwork.
You can't stop.
Ninety-eight...
ninety-nine--
Come on, last one.
You're done for today.
Go see Ira
about getting a locker.
Sure, he'll make the weight.
The kid's been sleeping in Saran Wrap
for the past two weeks.
Hey, who's bright idea was it to
keep him at junior lightweight, anyway?.
Exactly.
Saturday, he'll be at 29.
Okay.
Talk toyou later.
You're the girl
Hector told me about.
- You need a locker.
- Yeah.
Well, we ain't big-time, hon.
We're not really set up
for the ladies yet.
This neighborhood don't really catch on
with the lawyer types.
We don't use this
too much anymore.
It's yours ifyou want
to throwyour stuff somewhere.
Thanks.
Okay, what is mass?.
Mass is the measure of
a body's resistance...
to acceleration.
It is different from
but proportional to that body's weight.
What is weight?.
Weight is
the gravitational force...
exerted by the Earth
on that body.
Now, this is why...
if a body is outside
the Earth's gravitational pull--
Girls.
I thinkyou both
know how this works.
- Yes, Mr. Coolidge.
- Yes, Mr. Coolidge.
This is why--
Make a fist.
How's that feel?.
Feels good.
Jab,jab.
Jab, right.
Good, now jab, right, hook.
Too wide.
- How long is this going to last?.
- What areyou talking about?.
"What areyou talking about??"
Stop being such a tough guy.
What doyou gotta do this for?.
You can't pay for it.
- What doyou care?.
- You should tell Dad.
Areyou for real?.
This would drive him nuts.
- Keepyour mouth shut.
- I can't believeyou sometimes.
You still got two rounds.
Yeah, but I can't do it right.
Then get back over there
till you can.
But it's pissing me off.
It's pissing you off?. What, doyou think
this is gonna happen overnight?. Huh?.
You think it came natural
to these guys?.
You think it's gonna
come natural toyou?. Huh?.
This timework the bag
slow and steady...
and don't stop
till the red light goes out.
Whatyou laughing at?.
You laughing at me?. Huh?.
Oh, mira, look.
Your bodyguard.
Guess the slave girls get a day off
when you slum it with Marisol.
I've had it with your dismal crap.
You're sick.
- You don't even know me.
- I know all I have to.
- Quit it.
- She hangs out with you to get to me.
You should know. You're
the center ofthe universe, right?.
It's the truth.
We're gonna be late.
Later, Diana.
You said you'd do my braids.
Yeah?. Well, call me when there's
an opening in your busy schedule.
Jab,jab.
Jab,jab, right.
Too much power.
Let's just box for now.
Hey, you deaf?.
I said too much power.
Jab, right, hook.
You been working on your hook.
This time finish it with an uppercut.
Same combination.
All force and no technique, huh?.
Come on.
Power is halfthe story.
Areyou scared of me?.
- That's funny. You look scared.
- I'm not scared.
I gotyou against the ropes,
and I'm gonna dance on your face.
See?.
Someone gets you whereyou don't
wanna be, you get outta the way.
Keepyour footwork smaller.
That wayyou can punch
from different angles, okay?.
Try it.
Now we're boxing.
You should start roadwork.
Run three miles four times a week.
Three miles?.
You gotta be kidding me.
At least three.
At this rate, you couldn't last
one round in the ring.
But I got power.
You said so.
Big deal.
You got the endurance of a corpse.
I guess I'll use
the track at school.
Don't bother about
clocking yourselfyet.
So wereyou ever a fighter?.
Oh, sure.
In Panama.
I had my day once.
So, what happened?.
What happens to most of us
who do it?.
We lose.
There's only two ofyou
in that ring.
It can be a lonely place.
How'reyou doin'?.
Haveyou seen Adrian?.
Yo, Adrian!
You got a visitor.
Most ofthese guys here,
what are they...
just dreamin'?.
Sure, they are.
They got no choice.
These guys, this is what they live for.
This is theirwhole life.
Was it like that foryou?.
To fight?.
Probably not.
I didn't have what it takes.
So what does it take?.
To be great, I mean.
I don't know.
A real strong will.
I was gonna go to a fight
at the Forum next week.
Ifyou want to see
some lightweight action...
Ira gets discount tickets sometimes.
I can come?.
It's no big thing.
For real?.
Maybeyou'll learn something.
Yeah.
Oh, here.
Thanks.
I hopeyou've all completed
the assigned reading...
and finished yourworkbooks.
This chapter deals with...
a fundamental concept in science--
the second law ofthermodynamics.
The primary element ofthis law...
is a word that we use all the time...
though it's tough to define.
That word is "heat."
What is heat anyway?.
A simple definition is this:
Heat is the energy
possessed by molecules...
because oftheirmotion.
It takes part
in everyphysical occurrence...
from the growth
ofone blade ofgrass...
to...
a key starting a car's engine...
to the explosion ofa star.
T esti ng those reflexes.
Friday you spar.
I 'm ready to?.
You're a quick study.
I am?.
You gotta pay me for last week.
- It's real silver.
- I can't sell it with these pictures.
Strangers to everyone butyou, huh?.
Yeah.
- I'll giveyou 40 bucks for it.
- That's all?.
It's not worth more than that.
Sixty.
Gimme a break.
Please?.
I'll giveyou 50 bucks.
Final offer.
You sure this is a good idea?.
Ray knows-- no funny stuff.
Try to be a gentleman.
Just keep it loose.
No pressure.
Take it easy on me this time, okay?.
Don't be a dick, and I'll try.
Why did he have to say that?.
Ignore him. Here.
How's it workin' with her?.
Gotta pay the bills.
When you get that desperate,
borrow from me.
Hey, Frankie, let's put in
some quality time.
- Sorry.
- Come on!
Don't be sorry.
Don't ever be sorry.
Look at him.
Okay.
Wheyyou throw yourjab--
Spit.
Rush him with some ofthe combinations
we been working on, okay?.
It's like I forgot everything
you've been teaching me.
Stop thinking so much.
You're doin' good.
You've been working hard.
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Guess so?.
Cal's gotyou conditioned
real good.
Thanks.
I'll be seeing you, Hector.
- Howyou gettin' home?.
- The 61. I'm in Red Hook.
I'm driving that way.
I don't mind the bus.
This place is deserted at night.
- I'll be fine.
- It's okay. No trouble.
I'm just in Gowanus.
The " F" and the "G"
are my nightmare trains.
"G" is the worst.
No wonder people
move out ofQueens.
You're luckyyou have wheels.
Lucky's winning the lottery.
My old man, he's a mechanic.
He has me running all around Brooklyn,
running errands for this ride.
Always gotta be thinking "expansion."
Anyway, you in high school?.
Yeah, my lastyear, I hope.
You still in school?.
- Am I immature or somethin'?.
- No, I just thought--
I'm just playing with you.
I graduated lastyear.
- My only achievement in life.
- Yeah, right.
It's true.
My mom cried when I got my diploma.
That's nice.
You gotta tell me where to turn.
We can stop right here.
- Right over here?.
- Yeah.
You live in a project?.
All my life.
Canales Community Houses.
What flooryou on?.
The 1 1 th.
- You're up there.
- Yeah.
Thanks for the ride.
I'll be seeing you.
What?.
- You're late.
- I was hanging out with Marisol.
- Thankyour brother for dinner.
- Thanks, bro.
And do me a favor.
Afteryou eat, take a shower.
You smell.
I think I will.
You looked all right in there
with Ray today.
It's more tiring than it looks, huh?.
What's he after anyway?.
Making me fight.
I just want to make him happy.
Lots ofluck toyou.
How can the history ofthe world
be so fucking boring?.
And all those people are dead too.
You still holding a grudge against me
because ofthat Veronica thing?.
- Ifyou are, I gotta tell you--
- You were holding a grudge against me.
I was pissed atyou
for stirring up shit.
I guess I was an idiot.
Shouldn't tell you who to hang out with,
even ifyourfriends are lame.
I wanna hang outwith you,
butyou neverwanna hang outwith me.
Seems likeyou
always got places to go.
You gonna deny
something's goin' on?.
- You're gonna laugh at me.
- What?.
You're gonna think
I'm full ofshit.
- Is it a guy?.
- No.
- Is he at P.s. 20?.
- No, it's not a guy.
Then what?.
I'm training to be a boxer.
Oh, be serious!
I am serious.
I'm training with HectorSoto at the
Brooklyn Athletic Club on Front Street.
You mean, like pow-wow-wow?.
Oh, that's cool.
You get hit?.
- In the face?.
- It happens.
You fight guys?.
That's all there is right now.
You got guys
hitting you in the face?.
You don't understand, Marisol.
It's likeyou're all you've got.
You're all alone in there,
you know?.
I can't explain it exactly.
You are crazy.
My crazy friend.
It's fun, that's all.
Doesn't sound like fun to me.
Well, there is this one guy.
I knew it. Name.
Adrian.
Adrian?.
What kind of girly name is that?.
Hey, hundred percent man,
ifyou know what I mean?.
And?.
And what?.
- How doyou know about this percentage?.
- Guesswork, Marisol.
How come everything's
gotta be a romance with you?.
I live for that shit.
What can I say?.
Good evening,
ladies andgentlemen.
We'll giveyou the formal introductions,
ifyou don't mind.
We'll give you the formal introductions,
ifyou don't mind.
Will all the boxers
kindly turn in their passports?
Will all boxers turn in
their passports...
over here at ringside?
Piece of work, ri ght?.
Who is he?.
Some hotshot promoter.
Always got new flesh to peddle.
- Come sit with us.
- No, thanks. I got my chair over there.
Thanks anyway.
Don't feel social?.
I understand.
Two, three, four, five.
Break. Break.
So you're becoming a serious fan?.
- I liked that guy Lopez.
- Yeah.
Garcia came back strong tonight.
If my paydaywas as sweet as his,
I'd come out fighting too.
I betyou would.
You thinkwe could go get
something to eat?. I'm starved.
I can't.
Got a date with mywife tonight.
I'll have a bacon cheeseburger.
Make it a deluxe with extra bacon.
Rare.
What?. I said I was hungry.
And foryou?.
A cup of soup, a garden salad
with Italian dressing on the side.
That's all.
- What kind of dinner is that?.
- Trying to stay at myweight.
Got a lot ofspeedyfighters
in my division.
- You compete?.
- Yeah.
You like it?.
Sure. Keeps me out oftrouble.
You a delinquent?.
Not anymore.
- How comeyou train with Hector?.
- You mean, like, at all?.
- Yeah.
- Because I want to.
- Aren'tyou afraid of gettin' hurt?.
- What, are you're not?.
No, it's just--
It's a dangerous sport.
I didn't make the cheerleading team.
How long you train for?.
Almost a year. Cal's got
a whole plan mapped out for me.
I might be lined up with Ray
in the next amateur heat.
- Your favorite guy.
- I hopeyou cream that asshole.
He's not that bad.
Yeah,just another harmless prick.
You two are friends?.
I feel like I should lie
and say no.
Don't lie.
We grew up
in the same neighborhood.
Yeah, he's cuckoo, he's fucked up.
You know, he's harmless.
Not everybody's blessed
with brains and talent.
So how comeyou didn't sit next
to Hector like he asked you to?.
'Cause I didn't feel like it.
He thinks you're a good fighter.
Hector got me started.
Yeah?. How comeyou still
don't train with him?.
Because I'd be 50 before
I got a pro fight with Hector.
What's the sense in doing this
ifI'm not gonna make any money, right?.
I can't work for my father forever.
My little brother, right out of school,
he enlists in the marines.
No, thankyou.
Besides, I don't think Hector
believed in me.
You wanna see
where my mom was born?.
Right there, 37 years ago.
You didn't have to walk me home.
I don't mind.
I mean, I can take care of myself,
you know.
I know.
I wanted to.
So what's it like in Gowanus?.
In places like this,
no one matters.
No one and nothing.
That's not gonna be my life, man.
I'm gonna turn pro,
and I'm gonna move far away from here.
Someplace where I'm not gonna
get killed doing my laundry.
Right. Or raped
in your own fucking stairway.
Shot for a pair of shoes.
That girl who's been at the gym,
all dolled up, watching you spar--
Is sheyour girlfriend now?.
Karina?.
Sometimes.
Oh, so she's
your sometimes girlfriend.
You know,
it's cool between us.
She's pretty.
Yeah, she is.
She's sweet on me, but it's like
I don't have time to--
- Be a Romeo?.
- Yeah.
Halfthe time...
I get a feeling that she only likes me
'cause I wanna go pro.
You being exploited?.
I'm serious.
She's gorgeous and all that,
but it's like...
sometimes we don't have much
to say to each other, you know?.
Sounds like a dream date
for most guys.
Yeah, it is.
Guess I don't know what I'm
supposed to be looking for anymore.
Well, what doyou want?.
Fuck ifl know.
Why'd you do that?.
I don't know.
You taste sweet.
Funny.
I always thought of myself
as salty.
You're wrong. You're sweet.
I gotta go.
I'll talk to you soon,
all right?.
Yeah.
Yo, where areyou going?.
That time ofyear again, ladies.
Time for the Presidential
Physical Fitness Exam.
I don't give a shitwhat the president
thinks ofmy physical fitness.
A mile's not gonna kill any ofya.
This year, ladies.
Good work, Guzman.
Looks like those hormone treatments
really do the job.
One more lap.
She's got a good chin.
I know.
Hey, champion!
What areyou doing here?.
Hi. Nice seeing you.
Ah, man, I just seen that guy
fighting on TVyesterday.
Good fight, champ.
Howyou doin'?.
He popped you real good.
I popped him back, didn't I?.
Well, you're getting the hang
ofthis game.
You gonna walk home?.
I'm taking off.
My dad will give me grief
ifl keep coming home so late.
Does he know?.
Know what?.
About this?.
Not unless he has binoculars
this very second.
So what exactly is this?.
Who knows?.
You still like me
with my black eye?.
I think I likeyou more.
Hi, Dad.
You stole money from me.
- I'm gonna payyou back.
- Who's this guyyou're running with?.
What the hell happened toyou?.
Did he do this toyou?.
Adrian?. No.
- How could you let him do this toyou?.
- Get away from me.
That's how it goes?. You hook up
with a creep who knocks you around?.
Right. You're so reformed now,
you're giving me advice?.
-I won't let this happen to my daughter.
-What's going on?.
- Go toyour room.
- You're not my mother.
Get out ofhere, Tiny.
I said get out ofhere!
Don'tyou fucking touch him.
You think Mom would give me
the same wise advise?.
That's it.
Give me backwhatyou took, and ifl
catch you with this pendajo again--
You'll what?. Fucking kill me?.
That was fast.
I ran.
I can see that.
My parents are light sleepers.
So what happened?.
You think
I could stay here tonight?.
Yeah.
But no monkey business.
I thought all guys
jumped at this chance.
I guess I'm not prime trim, huh?.
How'd you get so fucking crude?.
How'd you get so fucking polite?.
Shut up.
Soyou're serious?.
Cal tod me to keep a lid on it
until I fight Ray.
You two are gonna go at it?.
It's just a preliminary.
Amateur stuff.
So that "no sex" shit
is for real?.
It's for real.
Let's sleep.
Yeah, yeah.
Areyour parents still together?.
Not really.
My mom died a long time ago.
So what happened,
ifyou don't mind?.
She killed herself.
Man.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Me too.
Dream of me knocking Ray out
in the third round.
I already have.
What?.
Can I come in?.
Yeah.
I hear it's true,
you got a lover.
Oh, man.
First comes love,
then comes marriage.
Sensitive.
It's not funny.
Look, I don't know how
you pay Hector...
and I don't think I wanna know.
But Dad's wasting his money
on me and, well...
he won't know
ifyou use it instead.
What areyou gonna be doing when
you're supposed to be at the gym?.
I'm a geek.
I'll do something
constructive with my time.
Thanks.
Hi. You must be the new boxer.
I'm Candice.
Not bad for an old fart.
- How areyou doing?. Happy birthday.
- Thankyou.
I was just talking aboutyou.
I've come to defend myself.
Hey, rememberwhen I told you
that girls can't be boxers?.
Yeah, I remember.
Girls-- Excuse me--
Women have a lower center
of gravity.
Maybe they're more grounded
once they build strength.
It makes 'em
a different kind ofboxer.
- Are you serious?.
- It's just a theory.
The way to prove it is
to get more women in that ring.
One-twenty-six.
Must be all that muscle
you're building.
- What division?.
- You're a featherweight.
- You're not mingling.
- Huh?.
This is a party.
You should be dancin'.
- I'm not much of a dancer.
- Sureyou are.
I mean, you dance, right?.
- Hector says my footwork gets sloppy.
- Looks okay to me.
Let's box. Come on.
No, bro, not in Hector's kitchen.
But you're all serious and shit.
Come on. Be a man.
You know...
they say love
kills you in the ring.
Hector, I gotta go.
Butyou just got here.
Sureyou can't stay longer?.
No.
It was betterwith the ice cream.
Howyou feel?.
Tired.
This is a waste oftime.
Look, Adrian's got a bout coming up.
I don't mean to insultyou--
What's the big deal?. There's no one near
Adrian's weight to sparwith today.
Might as well give my gal a chance.
I don't like it, Hector.
Tell him to think ofher
as a warm-up.
This equality crap
has gone too far.
- Should we just forget about it?.
- No.
Just get rough on her in the first round
and Hectorwill stop it real early.
Go ahead.
Come on.
What'd I tell you?.
Hit me!
Hit me already.
I'm not gonna fight him
ifhe doesn't hit me.
Both ofyou, enough bullshit!
Now box!
You okay?.
Stay inside.
I loveyou.
I really do.
Come on.
I'm not running afteryou,
ifthat's whatyou want.
"A gender-blindamateur
boxing proposal...
is a statewide initiative
that responds to the ongoing demands...
for officially sanctioned
amateur matches...
while also addressing the expanding
presence offemales in the sport.
Male and female amateurs
within the same weight class...
are allowed to compete
with each other in the ring. "
Now that they're m ixi ng up
the guys with the girls...
you could have
a lot more opponents.
They got you fighting this girl
from Buffalo next week.
And you can have a fight
everyweek ifyou want.
Hey, Vince.
Long time no see.
Let me get this straight.
She's had three amateur matches
and she's already turning pro?.
That's a little premature,
don'tyou think?.
- Damn it!
- Trainer says kid's got a high fever.
Dead on his feet
with strep throat.
I'd fight thatyellow kid
with one arm.
Missy from Buffalo's 33 years old
and she can make some money as a pro.
The fight's totally called off?.
Why botherwith small-fry stuff
when she can be on TV?.
Calm down.
There'll be other matches.
Not soon enough.
It's a pathetic turnout, but I've gotta
give these people their $1 0 worth.
And half of my fighters
haven't showed up.
Come on, Ira.
Let's just see this thing in action.
All right.
Ifit turns ugly,
you can't say I didn't warn you.
- Nervous?.
- No.
All right. Remember,
you're judged on points.
Be aggressive and make legal punches.
- Nervous?.
- No.

You are a better fighter than Ray.
Come on!

This is a warning. Box.

- He can't do that, right?.
Last warning. One more time,

I've had it with you, kid.
Ladies andgentlemen...
in a unanimous decision,
Ray C.ortez is disqualified...
and Diana Guzman...
is declared the winner...
ofthis preliminary
featherweight match.
Al I this sneaki ng around,
and for what?.
T o get the shit beaten out ofyou,
that's what.
Thanks a lot, Dad.
But you know,
it was almost like entertainment.
Hey, I won tonight.
You hear me?.
I won.
What doyou think about that?.
I thinkyou're ridiculous.
You're nothing but a street fighter.
You looked like a loser in there.
Everything I know about losing
I learned from you, Dad.
- I'm your father.
- Yeah, some fatheryou are.
The only thing you had the heart to love
you practically beat into a grave.
- Shut up with that.
- You just had to push her, didn'tyou?.
I mean it!
Until she'd rather die
than answer toyou, huh?.
I said shut up with that!
I could snapyour neck right now
ifl felt like it.
- I could kill you ifl felt like it.
- No, no, no. Please.
Mom begged.
Did you stopwhen she said please?.
- I can't remember.
- Diana, stop it!
You belong to me now.
How does it feel to see
so much ofyourself so close?.
- How does it feel?.
- Diana, stop!
Please, Diana, stop.
Just stop.
All theseyears,
you just looked right through me.
Lookwhat the cat dragged in.
- Who are they?.
- Those are Hector's kids.
He doesn't see them too often.
Never mind.
Who was that?.
Nobody. Quit it.
- Oh, please.
- No, I'm serious.
This athletic shit makes you,
like, a class achiever.
- You think so?.
- Yeah.
Well, now that I got
school all covered...
I only have the world
outside ofthese walls to fuck up.
Damn, girl, that's grim.
It's the truth.
- Holy shit.
- What?.
Ex-hundred percent man
is toyour left.
Stop being so obvious.
Damn, girl.
- That's him with the forearms?.
- Yeah.
Well, ifhe's such an ex,
what's he doing here?.
I don't know. Maybe he's
a glutton for punishment or something.
A glutton for punishment, loca?
- Yeah.
- Shit, you better go over there.
I heard you fought Ray.
You're right.
He's a fucking case.
I feel pretty fucking stupid out here,
waiting for school to be let out.
Then don't.
Right.
So, where's yourwoman when
she doesn't have her tongue in your ear?.
Or doyou only bring her out
for special occasions?.
I came here to say I'm sorry.
Sorry forwhat, Adrian?.
Proving toyour friends
you can still snag the pretty girl?.
You gotyourself
a fuckin' trophy now.
Bet it makes you feel
real big inside, huh?.
I don't feel too big right now.
As a matter offact,
I feel pretty fucking small around you.
Must be nice.
Yeah, well, it's not.
You and me,
we just met each other, right?.
We barely know each other.
No problem.
So, then leave.
- Maybe I don't wanna leave.
- Why?.
You're offthe hook now,
free to do whatever.
That's not all
I wanted to say.
I told Karina it wasn't
gonna work out with her.
I told her
I finally met somebody that...
makes something happen for me.
Just 'cause it's true doesn't mean
I know what to do about it, okay?.
You got anything to say to that?.
So I'm someone, huh?.
Yeah, you are.
I was wrong.
There's more than
one ofyou out there.
And I hear she's good.
She's a southpaw, and she's won
most ofher matches 'cause ofit.
These next couple ofweeks
I'm gonna trainyou so hard...
you'll be wired like a machine.
There's all kinds
offighters out there.
The more versatile you are,
the better preparedyou are.
You gotta learn how to manage your
power, 'cause you got more ofit...
than people realize.
Howyou gonna do that?
First, you're gonna
strengthen yourjab.
Feels funny, ri ght?.
Southpaw now.
Okay?. I 'm Ricky.
I 'm Ricky.
Come on. Good.
J ab, jab.
Very nice.
Very clever.
Girls, I want a good, clean fight.
It's my decision if one ofyou
needs a standing eight count.
Ifyou score a knockdown,
go to the farthest neutral corner...
and stay there.
Don't come out until
I tell you to resume fighting.
Got it?. Let's go.
The key to this
is not losing your cool.
The judges are gonna give that to Stiles
'cause they see her hands moving.
Remind them you're in there with her.
That was nice.
Okay, your punches are making contact.
Your defense is strong.
Butyou gotta stagger her.
These judges won't giveyou any points
ifthey can't seeyou slowing her down.
Stop.
Ladies andgentlemen,
we have a split decision.
Hilljudges 29-27 for Guzman.
Ferrarajudges 29-27 for Stiles.
Andersonjudges 28-27 for Guzman.
And the bout goes to Guzman.
Based on the results
ofthe preliminary matches...
you've been advanced
to the fi nals.
Even though the first fight
was stopped?.
Yep.
You scored better than
a lot of the kids in your division.
That's great.
So, uh, who's next?.
Come on, Cal.
You saw herwith Stiles.
- What's going on here?.
- I'll tell you what.
This rinky-dink operation--
excuse my candor, Ira--
Iet this goddamn gender-blind program
get out ofhand.
You signed him up for it.
Boys are different from girls.
What's so wrong about
saying it out loud?.
Boys are different from girls.
No girl has what it takes to be a boxer.
Neither do most boys.
I'm gonna petition the fight.
Oh, come on,
you're the one always complaining...
you can't get enough matches
foryour guys.
Adrian's young.
He works hard.
He's a good-looking kid.
Ayear from now I want him
grooming for the pros.
Then you're pushing him.
You can't humiliate
my guy like this!
Ira, I need your support.
Fileyour protest,
but don't ask me to get involved.
I will saythis.
Let the boxers box,
and that'll speak for itself.
Unbelievable.
Hector, ifthis happens...
I'm telling Adrian no mercy.
You understand?.
Yeah. So will she.
This is crazy.
And Cal's right.
This fucks with my record.
It's your amateur record.
At least we got the same disadvantage:
We know each other's habits.
Fuck!
Come on. Stiles makes fights, right?.
You said ityourself.
You have lostyour mind.
I got it.
I won't make myweight.
- What?.
- I'll eat for a fucking change.
I won't fightyou,
and that's it.
- Who says you're the only one fighting?.
- I'm sorry, Diana.
I haven't trained all this time
to be stuck in a ring with a girl.
- Stuckwith a girl.
- Okay.
Stuckwith you.
- You're afraid I mightwin.
- No.
You're gonna play it
all manly and protective on me now.
Look, I'm just being honest.
- You're just like any other guy.
- Oh, yeah?.
What kind ofa guy goes around
beating up a girl that--
That he what?.
What?.
Just forget it.
It's not right.
Fine. All I know...
is ifyou don't fight me
in this match...
you're less ofa man
than you thinkyou are.
What is it that
you want from me anyway?.
You want me to takeyou
a little more seriously, huh?.
Is that whatyou want?.
Is thatyour idea
of Prince Charming?.
You need to takeyourself
a little more seriously.
Who's the one who said
it was all about the challenge?.
Who's the one who said
that they love to win?.
Well, I'm not gonna love
winning this one.
Then maybeyou shouldn't
be a boxer.
Oh, saycanyousee
Bythe dawn's earlylight
Whatsoproudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broadstripes and bright stars
Through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets ' red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Oh, I ' m sorry.
This seat is saved for someone.
That our flag was still there
You know what?. Forget it.
They're not coming.
Oh, say does that star-spangled
- The card says Diana Guzman. Look.
- Must be a misprint.
It doesn't look like
a misprint to me.
O'er the land ofthe free
And the home
Ofthe brave
How you feeling?.
Like I got nothing to lose.
Good, then.
Inside, you know him?.
- Yeah.
- How's he fight?.
He's always stepping left.
He relies on his right for power.
He jabs low,
and his right cross can knock me out.
Inside, you knowyourself?.
Yeah, I do.
Then that's all you need.
Welcome, ladies andgentlemen...
Welcome, ladies andgentlemen...
to history in the making.
New York's first gender-blind
amateur boxing finals.
In the gold shorts...
weighing in at 1 25 pounds--
Lead hi m with your jab.
Keep movi ng to your left.
Force him to come to you.
And in the lovelypurple shorts--
- I can't go through with this, Cal.
- Yes, you can.
Just do some damage in this round
and it will be short and sweet.
Ladies andgentlemen,
clapyourhands for...
Diana Guzman.
Box!
Pick up the pace, okay?.
- You're doing good by leading him.
- I got to get to his body more.
So she's got some defensive skills.
So what?.
Take her out and finish her.
Give me.
Box!
His jabs are getting low and his swings
are wild. That leaves him open.
Workyourway inside and go for
his brain every chanceyou get.
I don't care who this guy is toyou.
Don't be afraid to hurt him.
Get up, get up, get up!
Boxers, center ofthe ring, please.
Ladies andgentlemen...

The amateur featherweight champ
in these finals is...
Diana Guzman!
Yeah!
Satisfied?.
I n al I my I ife,
I never been so proud.
Never.
Let's go.
You got a deadly hook.
Someone really worked you over.
Your right cross
is no powder puff.
I gave you everything I had.
Me too.
Boxing, going pro...
I want it to be my ticket out.
But I gave you an opening.
It was stupid.
But that's what happens.
You just take advantage.
Yeah.
So, now I loseyour respect, huh?.
No.
After the other night?.
Come on.
You boxed with me
like I was any other guy.
You threw down
and you showed me respect.
Don't you see what that means?.
That life with you is war.
Maybe.
Maybe life's just war, period.
You said it.
My life's been a mess
since I met you.
So, you gonna dump me now?.
Probably.
Promise?.
