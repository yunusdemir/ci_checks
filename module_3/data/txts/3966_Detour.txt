A man suffocated
his baby daughter
and put her in a bag outside
Houston station.
Ordinarily, this would've been
a death penalty case,
but the killer made it
to Mexico,
and now faces life
without parole.
So, what does that teach us?
It teaches us that no law
or ordinance
is mightier than understanding.
Know the rule of law,
and you can bend it.
Understand its workings,
and you can turn
first degree murder...
Into second degree murder.
Second degree into manslaughter.
Hey, ho, Harper! Harper, buddy!
Wait up, man!
I got the baddest story
for you, dude.
I was at the Depot this weekend
with the chinaman,
and I dropped liquid acid.
Oh, yeah? How did that pan out?
Terrible. Not good at all.
Trip lasted 18 hours,
and then when I came to,
my hair turned white.
Yeah. It's white.
Here's the thing, though,
I don't remember being scared
or anything.
Don't get me wrong,
it was intense but it was fun.
So I go see the doctor,
ask him what he thinks about it.
He says that it might not even
be related to the acid at all,
that it could be hormonal.
If my pituitary gland is fucked,
starts kicking out loads
of estrogen,
I can grow tits or turn gay
or something.
I mean, what's worse,
being straight guy with tits,
or waking up and all of a sudden
you crave dicks?
Worse than that, you crave dicks
and your hair starts
turning grey.
I'll look like a gay skunk.
Well, now, what's your problem?
My mom's in a coma.
Oh, fuck.
Harper, dude, man.
I'm sorry, bro.
Of course she's in a coma.
What the fuck am I?
Am I the worst fucking friend
or the worst fucking friend?
It's all right.
Just forget about it.
Bullshit! I can't.
It's unforgivable.
I've been so focused
on my own shit,
my hair turning different
colors. I should've made time.
No, it's all right, man.
You were busy.
Hey.
Harper, buddy, what is this?
What are you doing to me here,
you putting the guilts on me?
Huh?
Come on, man,
you know I love your mom.
I just forgot, that's all.
Yeah, man. I know.
I know.
See you later.
All right, buddy.
See you later.

<i>Golden Colorado.
Can I get some...
He starts getting physical.
Now, you see my Cherry...
She's got a dollar sign where
most other girls got a heart.
And this John,
he picks up on it.
He says, "You like money,
don't you, you fucking whore?"
She says,
"I like money and cock,
and from where I'm sitting,
you don't got neither."
She said that?
So what did he do?
Pulls a knife,
cuts her right on her cheek.
Right there.
Motherfucker, it's gonna cost me
a fortune.
So anyway, Cherry starts
going crazy, as you can imagine.
I can hear her screaming
from the hallway.
Screaming like Fred Kruger's
got his finger up her ass.
I come around
to see what the fuck!
Cherry's pulled a gun.
She's standing there.
She got a Beretta
pointed at his head.
She's shaking.
I tried to talk her 'round,
but, well...
Bam, bam, bam.
Guess who had to clean up
the fucking mess?
- Holy shit.
- Mm-hm.
Who the fuck is this guy?
Watch out.
Get the fuck outta here.
Didn't your mother tell you
it's rude
to listen in
on other people's talk?
Not recently.
What did you say?
My mother's not doing so well,
so she hasn't really been honing
my social skills recently.
But what I think you're saying
is that maybe
she shouldn't have to.
You're running your mouth at me.
Johnny, come on, man.
He's drunk.
He's a grown-up.
He knows what he said.
Go home, buddy. It's late, okay?
We don't want
any trouble tonight.
Oh, it's not late.
It's not even ten o'clock yet.
And whilst I appreciate
your concern,
tomorrow morning,
when I wake up
and look myself in the mirror,
I'd rather see
a face full of bruises...
Than a face full of shame.
And I'm prepared to go and buy
all your friends over there
a drink.
As an apology.
Beyond that, go fuck yourselves.
Let it go, Johnny.
You can buy me a drink.
I'll have a bottle of scotch,
but we drink it together.
I'm not really in a social mood.
I'm not asking.
Either we drink together, or we
go round and round right here.
- Come on, Johnny.
- Shut the fuck up, fat man!
Are you laughing at me?
He's laughing at you.
- Follow me.
- Where we going?
What, you scared?
Are you scared of me?
If I was gonna kill you,
I'd do it already.
Trust me, you'll like it.
You like chocolate sundaes?
- Yeah. Where we going?
- You like girls?
- I'll take that.
- These aren't for you, Johnny.
Yes, they are.
So, uh...
What you wanna be?
What, when I grow up?
Yeah, what you wanna be
when you grow up?
A criminal lawyer.
- Defense, I hope.
- Yeah, defense.
What happens if you get
someone off who's guilty
and then they go out
and play ball again?
Just blame the prosecution
for not building a solid case.
I mean, people have a right
to a good defense.
Rich people, you mean.
All people.
Two days a week
I'm working for free.
What, so you're a crusader?
Look, I don't wear a cape,
but...
I do find it very hard
to walk away from injustice.
You be sure to give me your
number when you graduate.
Yeah.
What about you? Do you have
an area of expertise?
- You need something doing?
- No.
- Of course not. I just--
- What?
- You know...
- What?
I just like to hear
the other side.
No, no, no.
Your face.
You was thinking something.
Nah, I wasn't really.
Speak.
I don't know. My--
My step dad's a fucking asshole,
and...
And?
And sometimes I think it'd be
something if someone were to...
Ruffle his feathers a little.
You catch my drift?
No, I don't catch your drift.
"Ruffle his feathers"?
What, is he a bird?
No, I mean... you know.
Teach him a lesson.
Yeah. What, science, math, what?
Come on, man,
you know what I'm saying.
I don't know what you're saying!
Teach him a lesson, I mean...
You know, some guys I know,
that means kill him.
That what you mean?
No, of course not. I just...
I mean beat him up
a little maybe.
You gonna beat on somebody,
you gotta have a cause.
No, no, no. No more drinking.
Finish your story.
All right, so three months ago,
my mom gets in a car crash.
She's driving,
he's in the passenger seat.
They're both drunk.
The car comes off the road,
they hit a tree, all right?
And she's been in a coma
ever since.
And you blame him for it?
I blame him
because he's visited her
once in the hospital
in three months.
And while she's in there
fighting for her life,
he's going off to Vegas
and banging some...
Some cocktail waitress
named Rosy Hills.
Probably not much older than me.
Your old man's got
a taste for teen pussy.
My mom got a terrible set
of results tonight.
And if she gets more tomorrow,
then...
She's gonna have
her machine...
Anyway, he knows this.
But tomorrow he's gonna go on
some so-called business trip
to go see his whore in Vegas.
Now...
If that's the way
his mind's working,
if that's what little regard
he has for her,
then who's to say--
who's to say he didn't
have a hand in her death?
Right.
Let me ask you something.
If you could stop time,
cut yourself in half,
and one side of you goes off,
he kills this pussy hound.
The other side,
he stays at home,
don't know nothing about it.
When it's over, the two sides,
they don't speak--
Shit, they don't even know
what the other one's done.
You live your life
with clean hands.
Would you do it?
Yes.
That sort of thing
can be had, brother.
How much?
I mean, you know,
hypothetically speaking,
how much would something
like that cost?
Hypo-pathetically speaking,
20 grand.
We drive to Vegas,
clip this jock.
He ends up
in the sand somewhere--
Hey, boys.
- What's going on?
- Fuck off, Cherry.
No, she can stay. It's fine.
No, she can't stay.
Go on. Go.
Where were we?
Hello?
<i>Is that Harper James?
Yes.
<i>Dr. Ulmer would like</i>
<i>to speak with you.
Okay.
<i>I'll just connect you.
You all set?
Hm?
Your old man?
Shit.
No. No, no, no.
God, no. I was drunk last night.
Fuck that.
I forgot.
I should've called you.
Twenty grand,
three of us drive to Vegas,
you spot him, I shoot.
No.
No, that's not gonna happen.
Oh. Yes, it is.
Look, I said a lot of stuff
last night that I didn't mean.
You meant it.
You're just scared, that's all.
No, I was upset last night
I was upset
because of my mother.
- And we're going to Vegas.
- No, we're really not.
Shut your fucking mouth,
all right?
Your nerves are fucking
with you, that's all this is.
Hey, Harper! Everything okay?
Yeah, we're fine, Mr. Parfitt.
Thank you.
Okay, buddy.
Look, man.
I'm sorry, okay?
But I made a mistake.
I...
I apologize.
I don't want
your fucking apologies.
What I want for you to do
is put your money
where your big fucking mouth is.
I'm sorry. I can't.
- We're going to Vegas.
- I'm sorry.
Don't fucking walk away from me!
All right, you know what?
Let's do it, let's go.
Let's got to Vegas.
You made the right choice.
If you hadn't have come, you'd
be sitting at home right now,
thinking about what
could've been instead what is.
<i>I got a policy.
<i>Don't regret</i>
<i>the things you do,
<i>just the things you don't.
Ain't that right, Cherry?
You going somewhere?
You know what today is, right?
The hospital won't know anything
till 11:00.
- Yeah, did you go up there?
- I called them.
Yeah.
'Cause a visit's
out of the question, right?
Because I have business
to attend to.
Yeah, business.
What's that supposed to mean?
Hm. Oh...
I don't know. You tell me.
The business that will
keep this roof above your head,
if, God forbid, something bad
does happen to your mother.
Something bad already
has happened to my mother.
She met you.
You just got in, right?
Yeah, I just got in. So what?
So I'm guessing
you're still drunk.
Yeah, I'm drunk.
Then maybe you should take a
shower and cool off,
before you say something
you regret.
Hey, would you mind
if I made a phone call?
To who?
I need to call the hospital
about my mom.
- So, go ahead.
- I left my phone.
No, I should use a public phone.
If I use yours and something
goes wrong,
they'll be able to connect us.
Not this phone.
This phone's registered to some
shitbag geriatric in Malibu.
I cover my tracks, man.
Told you that.
I cover other peoples, too.
Ain't that right, Cherry?
So come on,
what are you waiting for?
- It's kind of private.
- I ain't gonna listen.
- It can wait.
- Fuck.
You all right?
Cherry?
What?
What is that supposed to mean?
I'm good, Johnny.
<i>She was facing straight ahead,
<i>so I couldn't see her eyes.
<i>But she was young,</i>
<i>not more than 24.
<i>Man, she looked as if</i>
<i>she'd just been thrown off
<i>the crumbiest freight train</i>
<i>in the world.
<i>Yet, in spite of this,
I got the impression of beauty.
<i>Not the beauty of a movie</i>
<i>actress, mind you,
<i>or the beauty you dream about</i>
<i>when you're with your wife,
<i>but a natural beauty.
<i>A beauty that's almost homely</i>
<i>because it's so real.
<i>Then suddenly she turned</i>
<i>to face me.
<i>How far</i>
<i>did you say we were going?
<i>Los Angeles.</i>
<i>Where you coming from?
<i>Oh, back there.
<i>- Needles?
- No.
<i>Oh, sure, Phoenix.
<i>You look just like</i>
<i>a Phoenix girl.
<i>Are the girls from Phoenix</i>
<i>that bad?
<i>The girl</i>
<i>must've been pretty tired
<i>because she fell asleep
<i>not 20 minutes after</i>
<i>she stepped into the car.
<i>She laid sprawled out
<i>with her head resting against</i>
<i>the far door.
<i>I didn't like</i>
<i>that part of it much,
<i>but I didn't wake her up.
<i>It wasn't that this girl</i>
<i>still worried me.
<i>I'd gotten over</i>
<i>that funny feeling I had
<i>when she looked at me.
<i>Which I put down as just my--
<i>The cab's booked</i>
<i>for just after 11:00.
<i>I love you more than anything</i>
<i>in the whole world.
<i>You are my world.
<i>Harper thinks</i>
<i>he's got something on me.
<i>I don't know what he thinks</i>
<i>he knows, but...
<i>You don't need to worry</i>
<i>about him.
<i>I'll take care of him.
You know, I imagine us
together real soon.
And we're gonna be so happy.
And all this misery
will be behind us.
<i>So, where's your old man at?
He's at the house.
He's still back there?
Yeah, yeah.
His flight's not until later.
He was about to leave when you
guys showed up.
Where's he staying at when he
gets in?
I got an address.
You know, a job like this,
I'm gonna need the money
up front.
Yeah, that's no problem.
Oh!
Well, fuck me, she's alive!
It's nice to have you back
with us.
Fuck off, Johnny.
- What was that?
- You heard me.
Don't hit me.
Don't you fucking hit me!
Fucking--
- Stop, stop, stop!
- You say something?
Huh?
You don't have to be physical.
Like that? What, are you
her guardian angel,
or do you wanna fuck her?
No, of course not.
- What, you think she's ugly?
- No.
She's your girl.
Yeah well,
what if she wasn't my girl?
- Johnny!
- Would you fuck her then?
No, come on,
what if she wasn't my girl?
- Would you fuck her then?
- But she is your girl.
Yeah, but, motherfucker,
what if she wasn't?
Come on, it's a straight
fucking question!
I want a straight
fucking answer!
Everything has its price,
you little shit!
Would you fuck her, yes or no?
Yes or no?
Huh?
If she wasn't your girl,
then yes.
Yes, I think she's very pretty.
Yeah, then you're very lucky,
because she's not my girl.
She's a fucking whore.
Anti-social fucking whore
Who needs to cheer
her country ass up.
Recognize who her
fucking friends are!
Miss.
Where's the shithole
in this shithole?
Hey. Are you okay?
What are you doing?
- What do you mean?
- Why are you here?
You know why I'm here.
I know what Johnny told me.
- Yeah.
- You're not the killing type.
Is there a killing type?
Yeah, and it ain't you.
Listen, you want some advice?
Get on that bus
and go wherever it's going
and have your boring,
miserable life
because I can guarantee
it'll be a whole lot better
than being in debt to Johnny.
I'm not gonna be in debt
because I'm gonna pay him.
What do you think happens when
Johnny's running low on cash?
"Hey, Harper, hey,
my car broke down
I'm gonna need
a little extra cash."
Well, then I'll say no.
And he'll politely remind you
one phone call from him
you're going straight to jail.
Yeah, and so is he.
No, no, 'cause you see Johnny
can call 20 maniacs in prison,
all doing life without parole,
who, for a case of cigarettes,
will say they killed
your step dad,
and you paid them to do it.
He's an expert
on shit like that.
So that's why you're with him,
because he's blackmailing you?
I heard him talking
about your face.
He said you shot someone.
<i>Yeah.
<i>Fuck me good!
Hello?
<i>Hey, man, what you doing?
Masturbating.
<i>Hey, man, I got the fear about</i>
<i>this whole hormone thing,
so I've been surfing the
gay sites, see if I've turned.
They got some crazy shit
on here, man.
Terrifying stuff. Gay gangers,
fucking orgies, muscle Marys.
<i>They even got this genre called</i>
<i>"the straight guys first time."
<i>I tried that. Nothing.
Toys, twinks, studs,
not a twinge.
And then I put the straight porn
back on...
Boom! I'm back, baby!
I got more wood
than a lumberjack.
How's your mom?
The same. Thanks for asking.
Listen, um...
I need that favor.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go for it.
<i>All right, so I need
to get some weed.
Wait, you wanna buy weed?
Yeah, I wanna buy a lot of weed,
but you can't ask me why.
- Why?
- Paul.
<i>- Is it for your mom?
</i>- What? No.
Medicinal?
No, my mom's in a fucking coma!
How is she supposed
to smoke weed?
You're right, dude.
That was dumb.
So, how much you need?
<i>I need enough
that if you were caught with it
<i>there's no way it could be</i>
<i>construed as personal use.
What's going on?
I told you not to ask.
Come on, man,
I broke up mid-whack for this.
Break your vow of silence.
Vincent's going to Vegas later,
and he's going to run into some
problems at the airport.
Yeah, I'm into that.
<i>All right. Cool, man.
All right. Thanks. Bye.
Hey, what can I get you?
Two beers,
a sparkling water for the lady
and get the boy a milkshake.
And what flavor?
Banana.
Have we met before?
I don't think so.
You were in my class
at Fairpoint.
I'm Claire Wiseman, remember?
Ah, yeah. I remember.
How are you?
I'm good.
Wow, it's so good to see you.
What have you been doing
these days?
Oh, this and that.
What happened to your face?
I was in a car crash.
I'm sorry.
You're still as pretty as ever, though.
Thank you.
Why don't you tell
your donut rubber friend
- What you do for a living?
- Come on, man.
She's a singer.
She's got a great voice.
Ain't that right?
You know, come to think of it,
I remember you singing
at school.
You were good.
Where do you sing at now?
- I sometimes sing at--
- Vegas.
Good for you!
Is that where you're headed?
Yes, we are.
- Wow, I wish I could come with.
- Well, you can't.
So why don't you jog
that cream pie ass along,
put our order in?
I guess I will.
I'll catch you in a minute.
You thought I was gonna tell her
you was a trick?
- I'm not a trick.
- He don't care.
I do.
You're not a trick.
Don't you gotta go make
that call?
Yeah.
You wanna keep this going?
It's getting tiring, you know?
You keep staring
in that rear view mirror,
you're gonna crash.
The fuck is wrong with you?
I swear to God,
you've been body-snatched
or something.
Alien.
What do you want from me?
I warned you I was crazy,
but you was all,
"Don't worry, baby,
I like crazy."
Where's that girl?
That girl was 16 years old.
Hi. Can I get Dr. Ulmer, please?
It's Harper James.
- I'll just connect you.
- Thank you.
<i>Harper.</i>
<i>I was just about to call you.
How are things?
<i>I was hoping I can see you</i>
<i>in person.
Just tell me.
<i>The second set of results</i>
<i>came back,
<i>and, I'm afraid to say,</i>
<i>there's no brain function.
<i>I really am very sorry.
<i>You have to take comfort</i>
<i>in the fact
<i>that you did everything</i>
<i>you could for her.
<i>You were by her side</i>
<i>the whole time.
<i>Some people never experience</i>
<i>that kind of love.
<i>As doctors,</i>
<i>we realize pretty soon
<i>that we can't save everyone,
<i>but we have to try.
<i>You couldn't have done</i>
<i>much more for her.
<i>We don't have to make any</i>
<i>decisions right now, just...
<i>I think you should just come</i>
<i>by the office
<i>and we could have a talk.
<i>Harper? Are you there?
<i>Harper?
- Ma'am.
- Hi.
- Hey, Claire.
- Hey, Mikey, what can I get you?
Make it
a cheese and mustard bagel,
coffee, and give me some juice
with that.
Okay. You got it.
How's Pete?
Oh, the same, you know.
He asked about you.
- Said you'd been sick?
- Yeah.
I had that bug that was
going around, everybody had.
You look better.
I'm gonna put your order in.
Yeah, thanks.
Hey, do you think that cop's
all right?
No, I think that
that cop's an asshole,
but we didn't do nothing wrong,
so relax.
We gotta make a detour.
I gotta go see Frank.
Why?
We can't go to Nevada
without seeing Frank.
Yes, we can.
We pass through Nevada without
seeing Frank,
Frank finds out,
there'll be drama.
- We don't need no drama.
- Who's this Frank guy?
- He's a friend of ours.
- Yeah, right.
Frank is...
Put it this way,
last time we was going
to Nevada,
Cherry was sitting on
a kilo of blow.
She had it tucked away,
if you know what I mean.
Most of it was in my bra.
We were stopped what,
five times?
At least five times.
But each time they didn't have
a cause for a search,
so they just had to let us go.
But on the fifth time,
they bring out this sniffer dog.
This...
I thought we was fucked
for sure,
but that dog,
he just walked on past.
I'm thinking, "Damn, Cherry must
have that shit packed tight."
Anyway,
we get to Frank's, and it turns
out we ain't smuggling coke.
We're smuggling baking powder.
The whole K is jack.
The spic dealer fucked us.
We ain't sure whether
to laugh or cry.
If it was flake,
we would've gotten 20 years.
- Federal.
- Wait,
so you didn't check it
before you bought it?
It was Frank's guy.
I didn't have to.
So, what happened?
When?
Wasn't this Frank guy angry
that you gave him fake drugs?
Like I said,
Frank's a friend of mine.
- Here's your check.
- I didn't ask for no check.
Thank you.
All right.
What you're seeing here
is video evidence,
proof, that Vincent Reed,
my mother's second husband,
somehow managed to convince her
to sign over control
of the house,
in the event of her death
or incapacity.
This in spite,
on the date that she
allegedly signed, right here,
she was in New York with me.
Look, I have our
air tickets here.
And here's a photo of the two
of us on the Brooklyn Bridge.
- <i>Harper! Harper!</i>
- Note the date.
Shit.
<i>Harper, get over here now!</i>
<i>Move your ass!
What?
You get over here. What is this?
- It's a knife.
- I know that, smartass!
What's it doing
in my hand luggage?
- I have no idea.
- You put it there.
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know why.
To make me look like shit
at the airport, probably.
Oh, yeah.
That's right. I forgot.
You're going on a business trip.
A business trip to go survey
the Davis Casino extension.
Except for the fact
that the Davis Casino
- isn't having an extension.
- It's not an extension!
We're developing
apartment blocks!
You're a liar.
You're a fucking liar!
Everything that's coming out of
your mouth is bullshit!
All right, buddy.
Why don't you tell me what it is
that you think you know?
You forged my mother's signature
on her will, yeah.
And you did a pretty good job
of it, Vince,
except for the fact
that she was with me in New York
on the date that she was
supposed to have signed!
And guess what?
That's not gonna hold up
in court, buddy.
I... I forged her signature
so that you would get your money
without having to go through
five years of litigation,
- if we get bad new today.
- So you did forge it.
So what?
Oh, but it was all for me,
right, Vince?
In a way, yeah.
Good. Are you fucking the
cocktail waitress for me, too?
What are you talking about?
I'm not stupid, Vince!
I know about Rosy Hills.
Rosy Hills?
Yeah, yeah, you are right!
I am fucking Rosy Hills
while your mother lies dying
in a coma!
But that's not even all.
- No?
- No.
I think you were driving the car
when the accident happened!
You wanted her to die!
How fucking dare you?
Get--
What the fuck is the matter
with you! Fuck!
Harper.
Let me do the talking.
Wait, you're not gonna stop,
are you?
We didn't do nothing wrong,
all right?
Don't speak, you understand me?
Don't say a fucking word.
Fucking shit.
<i>57, go ahead.
Control, Sierra Madre
calling in here.
Officer Andrews.
NV plates for a 1-2-3-1-9,
California plates.
Something wrong, officer?
My gut says "yeah."
You ran out the restaurant.
You forgot this on the table.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You know, I have no idea why
she wrote that.
She is a waitress.
She might've thought
it was part of the service.
Don't matter, though.
You've been hawking me through
your pig blinkers
since I walked into that place.
The question is, why?
Uniforms make me nervous.
- Do they now?
- Yeah.
I fought in Afghanistan,
got therapy.
- You's a vet, huh?
- Mm-hm.
Huh. Small world.
I served, too, 2002.
- Operation Anaconda.
- Your boys did a fine job.
Why, thank you, sir.
What's the name of your mission?
Oh, you know, we named it
Go Fuck Bin Laden.
Go...
Go Fuck Bin Laden?
Oh, man, I like that.
That's funny. That's funny.
What's the real name
of your mission?
You know, I can't recall.
Uh-huh.
Would you please step out
of the vehicle?
Put your hands on the hood.
Come on, man.
Put your hands on the hood!
A soldier's mission
is scarred on his brain.
You disrespectful piece of shit.
You think you some kind of
war hero?
Open your legs! Open your legs!
Okay.
Okay.
What we have here?
What's this, coke, meth, oxy?
I know how you hillbilly boys
like that oxy.
No, no, no.
That's crushed Viagra.
I'll need a shitload of it later
if I'm to fuck your wife.
You fuck!
You wanna laugh now?
You, get out of the car!
Get out of the car right now!
Get out of the vehicle!
Get out of the vehicle now!
Put your hands in the air!
Come on, move, Sister Mary!
Get over here!
- Yes, sir.
- Put your hands on the hood.
Yes, sir.
- Do I gotta cuff you?
- No, sir.
Good.
'Cause I only got cable ties,
and I do not need another
police brutality charge.
Yes, sir.
Keep your eyes right here,
you hear me?
Keep your eyes right here
and your hands on the hood!
- You hear that?
- Yes, sir.
- Stop crying.
- Yes, sir.
How are you doing, Miss?
Oh, I'm all right.
Yeah?
Getting your friends arrested
don't bother you none, huh?
They ain't technically
my friends, officer.
They hired me for the day.
You a hooker?
I'm a dancer.
Prostitution's legal in Nevada,
but this ain't Nevada.
I ain't fucked them yet,
neither.
Yeah, can't blame you.
I need you come up
out of this car,
give me a little tour around.
That all right?
- Sure.
- All right.
You can start by popping
the trunk, that all right?
- Sure.
- All right.
Keep your eyes on me!
Yes, sir.
- Jesus Christ.
- Drop the gun!
You're making a mistake, ma'am!
Making a big mistake!
You heard me, asshole,
drop the fucking gun!
- Shoot the prick!
- No!
- Kill him!
- Do not kill him!
No, no, listen to him!
Don't kill me, ma'am! Please!
Drop the fucking gun!
Okay! Right there, lady,
all right?
Please! I got a wife and kid!
- I just wanna go home!
- The keys for the handcuffs.
Take the keys and go, all right?
Just take the keys.
Right there. All right?
Look, I got a wife and kids
at home.
I just want to go home. Okay?
Give me that fucking radio!
Here, you can have these.
I just don't want any trouble.
- Just put the gun away.
- Get in the trunk.
No, I'm not getting
in that trunk.
Get in the fucking trunk.
Get in the fucking trunk!
- Get in the trunk!
- Okay!
Okay.
Pull it together, Harper.
Come on.
Keep it together.
Keep yourself together.
You're not the kind of guy
who folds.
This is not the time to panic.
He killed her.
He killed your mother.
Hey, Harper!
Everything okay?
Uh, yeah!
Nice day for a swim.
Yeah.
Listen, I can clear those leaves
for you, if you like.
You've enough to worry about.
No. No...
I like the distraction.
Okay.
Fuck.
<i>You have one unheard message.
<i>Hey, Harper, it's Paul. I got</i>
<i> that little something for you.
<i>I'm on my way around.
No, no, no, no. Fuck!
Hey, Paul.
Hey, it's Harper.
Listen, hey, whatever you do,
you absolutely cannot
come over here right now.
There's just been a...
Just don't come.
Just don't come over.
Fuck.
Fuck.
- Hey, Paul--
- What's up, buddy?
Wait, you can't go in there.
Why?
You just can't. Come here.
What's going on?
Uh...
- My step dad's in there.
- Oh, shit. Okay.
Do you still want the weed?
Uh... yeah, yeah. I'll take it.
Okay, well there was
a slight problem with the weed.
Do you remember the mine shafts
we visited when we were kids?
Do you remember Reece
got lost for three days?
They got this Tree of Love
Music Festival there now.
Imagine if one of them stoners
gets lost in them tunnels, dude.
They're not gonna find that
fool's body for a hundred years.
But anyway, that's why
I couldn't get any weed.
It's all right. It's all right.
I'll take whatever you have.
Harper.
I've been on a wild goose chase
all morning, man.
At least hear me out.
Do you wanna grab a coffee
or something?
I... you know what?
I can't, man.
I just really gotta go see
my mom in a minute.
Shit, man. I'm sorry.
Look, I couldn't get the weed,
but do you remember that stuff
that turned my hair white?
Boom. Liquid acid.
Schedule One drug.
They find that on him, man,
they're gonna
throw his ass away.
However, if you're feeling
compassionate,
or just fancy some fun
of the twisted variety,
put some of that
in his eye drops.
He'll wind up in an institution.
All right. Thanks.
- You okay, man?
- I'm fine. Fine.
Hey, buddy.
Dude, you know I love you, man,
and your mom.
When you go visit her
at the hospital,
give her a big hug for me, okay?
Hey, come here, buddy.
Come here.
It's gonna be okay, I promise.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna call you later, okay?
All right. Thanks, man.
<i>We're gonna have to kill him
<i>and dump his body somewhere.
<i>Kill a fucking cop!</i>
<i>Are you crazy?
What do you wanna do,
just let him go?
Well, we're not gonna kill him!
Oh, Jesus Christ. Fuck.
All right. All right.
I have something to admit.
No, you have nothing to admit.
Just trust Johnny.
He knows what he's doing.
Admit? What the fuck
are you talking about?
- Nothing.
- Say what you was gonna say.
All right.
I'm scared, okay?
I admit that I'm scared.
Feeling scared is normal,
but don't be feeling bad
for no cop.
You seen how he was acting up.
Some people deserve
what they get.
Well, there's gotta be
another way.
- You don't have to kill him.
- Oh, I ain't gonna kill him.
- You are.
- What?
I gotta know which side
you're on.
Now, I know that may seem tough,
but as you get older,
you realize that life isn't
about the choice you make.
It's the one you're given.
You can't live in the past.
Ain't that right, Cherry?
I said,
"ain't that right, Cherry?"
Yeah. That is right, Johnny.
Yeah, that's right.
So the choice I'm giving you is,
kill the cop,
then go to the bank
and get my money,
or go to the bank, get my money,
and then, well,
I think you got it.
So, what's it gonna be?
20,000 in this
envelope, five in that one.
Anything else, sir?
Have you lived here in Barstow
your whole life?
- Yes, I have.
- Yeah?
Do you like it here?
- Not really.
- Why is that?
Boring as hell.
What was you talking
about when we was in the diner?
When?
What do you mean, "when"?
When you was in the diner
and I was in the head.
Nothing.
Your lips were moving.
Nothing was coming out.
He asked if I was all right.
Why?
'Cause you hit me.
What did you tell him?
I told him I was fine.
- What else?
- Nothing else.
I was gone a while.
You must have said something.
Nope.
They only had five available.
I'm giving you
the rest tonight in Vegas
and I'll give you more
to buy the cop.
Cop ain't for sale.
You said everything
has its price.
How much?
If the cop lives,
I'll give you ten grand.
I'm guessing you got a plan
that don't involve me
spending a lifetime in prison.
Yeah, I got a plan.
Yeah?
You wanna tell me that plan?
Yeah, there's a mine shaft
near here.
Take me there, I'll show you.
All right.
First we gotta go see Frank.
These guys find out
there's a cop in the trunk,
they're gonna kill us all.
You make one fucking noise, pig,
I'm gonna blast
your fucking head off.
Is he in?
Yeah.
What kind of mood?
He's never in a good mood.
Well, I got you all wrong,
didn't I?
No. You got me just right.
Hi, Cherry.
Hi, Frank.
I had a dream about you
last night.
- Really.
- Yeah.
It's so strange
that you're here.
Hey...
You mind if I give you
my number?
My card?
- Sure.
- Yeah.
Is that all right?
Wait-- wait a second.
Pen.
Call me, huh?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Mm.
Ladies.
Hey, hey!
Hey, come here.
Be awake
the next time I come in.
Frank.
What's going on?
Cherry's sitting,
waiting in the car outside.
You don't bring her in
to say hi?
She's tired.
- Tired?
- Yeah.
We're all fucking tired.
- Who's the boy?
- A friend.
What kind of friend?
Kind that picks up the tab.
Now that's five grand.
I'll have the rest for you
by tomorrow.
Why not today?
I got something going on
down in Vegas.
- You want a drink?
- Sure.
What did I say to you
the last time you were here?
You said don't come back
empty-handed!
Wrong! Lift your chin.
Stay still.
- Frank, please!
- Lift your chin up!
Didn't break. It doesn't count
because it didn't break.
- Frank, I'm gonna have your--
- Shut up!
You say one more word,
Ralph here'll put you in a box,
you understand?
Fuck!
My shoulder.
My shoulder.
I can't throw so hard anymore.
It's your lucky day, huh?
The last time you were here...
I said,
I would've preferred you have
come with nothing
than another excuse.
And what do you bring me?
I bought a kilogram
of baking powder from you...
And you're still breathing.
Why is that?
Why?
Why? Come on, come on.
Speak!
I know you've been good to me--
"Been good to me." Me-me-me.
You're a cretin, you know that?
You know what a cretin is?
A cretin's someone
who's brainless, childish,
lacks intelligence,
speaks nonsense that only
other cretins can understand.
You're busting your ass
with these repayments, why?
Because you have feelings
for this girl.
This girl that you treat
like a fucking whore.
And me! Me!
I have feelings for her, too!
But it seems I'm the only man
in the whole fucking world
who can't nail
that piece of ass!
So...
I'm gonna make you the same
offer I made you last time.
The girl stays here with me
and the debt is cleared.
You can even take
your five grand with you.
Cherry stays here,
and you can visit.
I can't do that.
Get your ass up.
There's one thing...
That my success
is based on...
And that's my word.
That's all I have.
Tomorrow...
When the sun rises
over those hills,
if I don't see 50 grand
sitting across my desk,
I'm gonna come,
I'm gonna find Cherry,
and I'm gonna sell her
to some bearded,
kneepad-wearing motherfucker
who will put her
in a tent somewhere
and use her as some kind of
hillbilly fuck mat!
Do I make myself
absolutely clear?
Yeah!
Now get the fuck out of here.
- Ralph?
- Yes, boss.
Keep an eye on that degenerate.
Call our people in Vegas.
I don't want that cretin
running loose.
<i>Hey, we're not in right now,
<i>but leave a message</i>
<i>and we'll call you right back.
<i>This message is for Vincent.
<i>Your cab's on its way.
Hello?
<i>Is that Harper James?
Yes.
<i>Dr. Ulmer would like</i>
<i>to speak with you.
Okay.
<i>I'll just connect you.
You're all set?
Hm?
Your old man.
Shit.
No. No, no, no.
God, no. I was--
- I was drunk last night.
- Fuck that.
No, I was upset last night.
Upset because of my mother.
- We're going to Vegas.
- No, we're really not.
Shut your fucking mouth,
all right?
Your nerves are fucking
with you,
- That's all this is.
- Hey, Harper.
Everything okay?
Yeah, we're fine, Mr. Parfitt.
Thank you.
Okay, buddy.
I'm sorry,
but I made a mistake, okay?
I apologize.
I don't want
your fucking apologies.
What I want for you
is to put your money
where your big fucking mouth is.
I'm sorry.
Fucking walk away from me!
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>the mine shafts

All right, you know what?
Let's do it, let's go.
Let's go to Vegas.
But let's take my dad's car.
Why?
Why not?
Get out of the way,
you fucking vegans!
Jesus fucking Christ!
What are you twirling,
a fucking stick?
Okay, this is where the
Anderson Shaft, is right here.
Pull over there
by the mine shaft.
What's the plan?
Pass me a bottle of water.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You ain't gonna just let
this guy go.
He's probably dead
from dehydration.
And if he's not,
this is liquid acid, all right?
He's gonna be in the grip
of some serious hallucinations
for the next 48 hours.
He won't know fact from fiction
for a week,
let alone be a reliable witness
in court.
All right.
But if you can't tame
this piggy, I will.
Sir? Hello?
I think he's dead.
Sir.
Sir! Sir!
Wait! Wait!
I'm trying to help you.
Here, drink this! Drink this!
It's water! It's water!
Wait!
Hey, go that way.
Towards the Festival!
Let's go to Vegas.
Welcome to the Casino, sir.
Is there any baggage
in the trunk?
No. Nothing.
We ain't staying long.
No problem.
Two rooms. Big ones.
And put us down
at the comp rate.
I'm gonna need a credit card.
- Can I get a name?
- Peters.
Barney Peters.
Okay, Mr. Peters,
you're good to go.
Thank you. Thanks.
You go get my money,
then we find your old man.
And I got the keys,
in case you think about
going anywhere.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna go to the room.
Stay there.
I might need that ass.
I'm gonna rent a car...
And I'm gonna drive away.
And I'm gonna keep on driving.
And if you wanna come,
be outside the casino at 10:00.
Can I get light and a bourbon?
I'm guessing you're a winner.
In what regard?
In regard
to that stack of chips.
You think I gamble to win?
Then why?
Why do you think a boxer fights
when he's got more money
than he can ever spend?
'Cause he's stupid.
He does it to feel alive.
He'd rather risk it all
than be dead here or here.
To be really alive...
You gotta gamble more
than you can afford to lose.
You just gotta know how much...
Or what that thing is.
Can I get a prepaid phone?
Hello, police? This is
the valet at the Collinen.
I was just taking a Mustang
down to the garage
and I accidentally
popped the trunk, and well...
There's something
you gotta see in here.
All right. Thanks.
Would you like extra insurance?
Uh, no, thanks.
Here you are.
Any vehicle from Lot D.
Just show this at the gate.
Thank you.
- Going someplace?
- No.
Hi, sweetie.
Come on in.
Can I get an ID
on a blue Mustang?
Drive.
<i>What happened?
Fucking asshole.
He brought a guy to my room.
Cops burst in,
arrested him for murder.
How did you get out?
They thought I was a hooker.
<i>Listen to me.</i>
<i>He's gonna kill her!
He's gonna kill--
He's gonna kill Cherry!
What are you talking about?
Frank Malone! If I don't get
Frank the money...
Get inside!
...he's gonna kill Cherry.
Please! Please!
You're allowed one phone call.
You want my advice?
Forget the girl
and call a lawyer.
I'll go see if they got a room.
I never killed the guy
who cut my face.
I mean, I shot him.
Me and Johnny, we dope guys.
I ain't proud of it,
but we bring guys
back to the room,
guy falls asleep,
Johnny comes in,
we rob him.
Except this time,
the guy don't sleep
and Johnny don't show.
This asshole. He hit's me.
He's on top of me.
I'm fighting him,
screaming, crying...
And Johnny don't show.
This guy smashes a bottle
and says
it's either gonna be his cock
or the bottle inside of me.
I try to run, he cuts my face,
and I hear the sound of a gun,
and I'd shot him.
Then Johnny shows up.
That asshole would've lived,
but Johnny didn't drive him
to no hospital.
He took him to a storm drain.
What about you?
Why'd you kill him?
<i>Cherry...
<i>Frank's coming to get you.
<i>I didn't wanna scare you.
I just...
Let's go.
Ralph.
Go get my Cherry.
<i>Why didn't you</i>
<i>just call a lawyer?
<i>What, instead of
running to Mexico
<i>like every other idiot?
<i>I panicked.
But there's still time.
You got money.
Hire a big-shot lawyer.
The only way a lawyer's
gonna keep me out of jail
is to get me to plead insanity,
then send me to a looney bin.
I'll be like McMurphy from
O<i>ne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
Yeah.
Nurse Ratched will give me
a lobotomy.
All right, Mr. Doom and Gloom.
Well, I've seen that movie.
The chief gets away.
So it's kind of a happy ending,
at least for one of them.
- You wanna get a soda?
- Sure.
That's $5.48, please.
What are you doing?
I want you to take the money.
I don't want the money.
I wanna go to Mexico with you.
You can't.
Why?
Because I'm gonna get caught.
What's the reason for your visit
to Mexico, sir?
Vacation.
May I see your ID?
Yeah.
Where are you heading
for your vacation?
Uh, Baja.
Got an address?
I'm staying at the Four Seasons.
It's my mom's
wedding anniversary.
Go ahead.
Are you all right?
Do I look all right?
Give me your hand.
Where are we?
Somewhere in Mexico.
Why'd you come back?
What happened?
<i>Hey, sweetie.
<i>I got the hospital staff
<i>to bring this recording over</i>
<i> to you.
<i>I'm sorry I haven't been there</i>
<i>for a long while.
<i>I just...
<i>Just can't bear</i>
<i>to see you lying there.
<i>I'm not good with emotion,</i>
<i>you know that.
<i>The cab's booked</i>
<i>for just after 11:00.
<i>I love you more than anything</i>
<i>in the whole world.
<i>You are my world.
<i>Harper thinks</i>
<i>he's got something on me.
<i>I don't know what he thinks</i>
<i>he knows,
<i>but you don't need</i>
<i>to worry about it.
<i>I'll take care of him.
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I imagine us together...
<i>Real soon.
<i>And we're gonna be so happy.
<i>And all this misery</i>
<i>will be behind us.
<i>Johnny used to say
that bad luck followed me
<i>like a pervert followed</i>
<i>a school bus.
<i>But Johnny could be wrong,</i>
<i>just like anyone.
<i>He did say one thing, though,</i>
<i>that seemed to ring true...
<i>That when a man's got murder</i>
<i>on his mind...
<i>He should dig two graves.
<i>One for the victim.
<i>And one for himself.
