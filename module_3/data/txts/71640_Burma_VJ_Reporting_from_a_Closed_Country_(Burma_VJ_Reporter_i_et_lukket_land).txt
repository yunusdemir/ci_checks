When I pick up the camera,
maybe my hands are shaking.
I may have a heavy heartbeat.
But after shooting for a little
while, it is OK.
I have nothing in my mind.
I have only my subject.
I just shoot.
This is my country.
And this is the way it has been
for more than 40 years.
I only remember a few weeks
when things were any different.
In 1 988 I was just a little boy.
But that's when everybody
in Burma got into the streets.
They'd had enough of military rulers.
They wanted change.
It was the students
who led the demonstrations.
They became more
and more outspoken.
They demanded
that the generals give up power.
There was so much hope.
We even had Aung San Suu Kyi -
- who came back from
Europe to lead the people.
But the generals wanted it
differently.
At the end of the day 3000 people
were killed in the streets -
- and it was all over.
I feel I want to fight for democracy.
But I think we had
better make a longer plan.
We cannot go out into
the streets again and get shot -
- because we have
no more people to die.
These people were so brave.
But sometimes I feel
they died for nothing.
There is nothing left from '88.
It's as if everything
has been forgotten.
Aung San Suu Kyi is in house arrest
in the middle of Rangoon.
She is in the house
but you cannot go and talk to her.
There is just... darkness.
I feel the world
is forgetting about us.
That's why I decided
to become a video reporter.
At least I can try to show
that Burma is still here.
We have to hide our camera in a bag.
We can only shoot for a little while.
And after that we have to smuggle
our footage out of the country.
It is a very difficult job.
But we try.
If they catch me with a camera
I know I will go to prison.
And if people tell us what
they think, they will go away too.
So they keep silent.
Our stories are silent.
In the night times I always think
about what I did during the day.
A little worried... "Oh, who could
have been watching?"
Or something like that.
What if someone knows me and
noticed I am shooting pictures?
Yeah, I think about this.
Fear is so deep in everybody.
Also in me.
Sometimes when I feel like this
I go and see Ko Maung.
- Did you buy this camera for me?
- It is for you, you little devil.
There is a whole group
of us in Rangoon.
We are all facing
the same problems -
- but Ko Maung
looks at it differently -
- even though he's already
spent 1 2 years in prison.
He is a special guy.
He doesn't seem to mind.
- Where is the zoom?
- Right here.
- I see.
- You can use it either way.
Ah, OK, OK.
That is very convenient.
Yes, you will love it, too.
Oh, shit!
Ko Maung is a persistent person.
He is rarely upset or depressed.
He is strong.
Sometimes I don't see
the point of what we are doing.
We try so hard
and we don't change a thing.
Nonsense. Our job is important.
You can't expect a scoop on CNN.
That's childish.
What matters is to keep telling
the truth about our country.
- But everything stays the same.
- Don't be too sure.
People have had enough.
They're ready for change.
People are scared.
It's in their blood. How long have
you been fighting the generals?
1 9 years.
-That is a long time.
- Exactly.
That's the whole point. You should
listen to what the Buddha says.
Don't be greedy.
Be patient.
Things will happen, brother.
Any information, pictures and photos
from Internet reporters are crucial.
It's telling the world
what is going on.
They are the world's
eyes and ears in this situation.
We journalists can't fulfill our role.
We are banned
from going in.
I remember 1 5 August quite well.
I was on a bus to Rangoon.
I decided to make a story.
Because the mood was
quite strange on the bus -
- not like usual.
What took you so long?
I've been waiting for ages.
Put it somewhere safe.
-The fare has gone up to 1 000.
- What? Why not 500?
Fuel prices are up, you know.
I ought to make a complaint.
Complain to anyone you like.
Try the police!
What am I supposed to do?!
On that day the government
raised fuel prices to double rate.
Everything got more expensive.
It was a huge problem.
- I'll have to take her out of school.
- That won't help you.
- It's a bloody mess.
- Excuse me, may I ask a question?
They are still scared.
Who's an informer?
Who's Military intelligence?
But although they are not talking
I know something'll happen soon.
I can feel it.
When I arrived in Rangoon -
- I heard that a prominent
demonstrator -
- was going to stage a solitary
strike in a crowded market.
Security is very tight in Rangoon.
So many government people
are there without uniforms.
He won't last for more than two
or three minutes; he'll be arrested.
For our team it was time
to use all our energy.
We decided
everyone would go there.
So we went there
and spread around -
- and these things
happened just in front of me.
-The people are suffering.
-The government is doing nothing.
Take to the streets
and join us!
Kyaw Kyaw got this footage.
My tape is lost.
I got too greedy at the time.
Because I followed them.
That's me in the white
shirt with the black bag.
I followed very close and saw them
throw the demonstrator on a truck.
I ran towards the truck.
I had to get a picture of this!
- And I hear somebody shouting:
-There's a camera!
It was me.
They got me.
They took me to an office of
the secret police to question me.
Howe did I get the camera? Why was
I shooting this? So many questions.
I explained that I'd borrowed it
and was there by accident.
They said "We don't believe you".
"But we keep the camera and
the tape and you can go".
I was relieved.
But I knew I should not be fooled.
Why did they release me? Just to
follow me and see what I did next.
Do I work with somebody else?
How do we operate?
All those kinds of things.
When I informed my
organization's headquarters -
- they told me, "You are not
secure enough in Burma".
"We want you to come to Thailand".
But I didn't reply to their email.
I ignored their order.
I know something will happen.
If I miss the chance to shoot now -
- I'll have to wait another 20
years. It is once in a blue moon.
So I decided
"Whatever happens to me, -
- I'll do it!"
Where are you now?
Have you seen the lady yet?
I'm at the bus stop. I think it's
happening across the street.
Where are you?
I can't find you in this crush.
Hey! I can see it now!
It's right in front of me!
Looks like she brought some friends
to protect her.
After a few days I got
the news that Su Su Nway, -
- who is very famous
for her courage, -
- would make a
demonstration.
It can lead to a bigger demonstration
if she can do something very well.
So we need to promote.
As usual, we spread around.
Don't worry,
I got the whole thing now.
That's it, then. But be careful.
There's a lot of agents.
We can't afford to lose this.
We're fighting for all the people!
Everybody join us!
It's the thugs!
The thugs are coming!
They try really hard to get her, but
the people cover and protect her.
It was a big moment for us
and a big mistake for them.
Because they did so many brutal
things in front of people -
- and we could document that.
Pull him out! Get him!
Help him! Pull him back!
Mo, no, you bastards!
Help her! She can escape this way!
We are shooting this
and the police are shooting us.
They record me
and I record them.
So we can also define
who was who at the time.
Take her! Take her!
We shoot everything.
Get it in the camera, you know!
The taxi driver is saying -
- "Yeah, they are very brave!
I'm glad to see this!"
"I am very excited!
I am saving money for my family -
- and if something happens
I will join the demonstration!"
This is not normal.
Saying political things to a stranger
has never happened before.
But at the time we knew
what would happen next.
Yeah, the movement
is bigger and bigger.
And now we edit the pieces
and we send it to Oslo.
A few hours later a friend called me:
The pictures were shown
on CNN and the BBC.
Shown repeatedly.
Again and again.
Such public displays of dissent
are exceedingly rare in Burma -
- and a clear challenge to the
country's hard-line military rulers.
Some say the most serious
challenge in more than a decade.
The Democratic Voice
of Burma, or DVB, -
- uses satellite TV
and short-wave radio -
- to send news of the
protests around the world -
- and, for the first time,
back into Burma.
About 30 reporters are on
the ground working undercover.
They film material and then
smuggle it out of the country -
- at great personal risk.
It was so amazing to see our
footage going around the world.
For the first time I feel
we can really do something.
But I also know for sure I cannot
stay in Burma a day longer.
So finally I agreed to go
to Thailand for a while.
We all think there will
be more demonstrations -
- and people are
heading for the movement.
So I will be the centre -
for spreading
the news around the world.
I was very unhappy at the time -
- to be in the office,
to answer the phones -
- and to call and send emails
into Burma and manage people.
I just wanted to be in the field.
Hello. Since I'm here I cannot
do the Rangoon job for you.
I'll stay one month.
Then I'll go back.
But I needed to be there -
- and I began preparation
for our cameramen in Burma.
- Hello.
- Hello. Can you hear me?
Loud and clear.
How many cameras have you got?
Five altogether.
How is the new office?
It is quiet and safe.
What about the shop opposite?
In the shop opposite
there are only two elderly people.
There is a problem.
Our cameras are not working well.
We've already had to do repairs twice.
The lens doesn't retract.
We'll have to share with the other
team if we're to be effective.
- Can you see inside?
- Mo, the view's blocked.
What did you hear?
Tell me, what other news is there?
Wait, hold on.
- Hello?
-Tun Zaw is getting some news.
- Who is he talking to?
- Monks. There are many monks.
- I'll ask my people.
- Hello.
It's the monks!
The monks are joining!
Suddenly the monks
were beginning to move.
I called a leader ofthe monks
I had met before.
Hello...
Hello Reverend Monk.
Don't address me as a monk.
Call me Ko Myo.
- OK, OK.
We gave the generals
an ultimatum.
If our demands are not met
and the generals remain silent -
- we have prepared for action.
We will march all over the country.
Mandalay, Rangoon.
The whole world must know
that the monks are on strike.
How are you going to do it?
We've already designated
lots of locations.
But for security reasons
I can't tell you where.
- Where the hell are they?
- Should be down here somewhere.
- Look!
- Driver, we'd like to pay!
- Shit, they are walking fast!
- Hurry up, hurry up!
What are you doing
with that camera?
Your reverence,
I am a reporter.
Don't! It'll cause problems.
Don't take pictures!
- We are from DVB.
- Go somewhere else!
Ko Maung and Tun Tun
are trying to talk to the monks.
But the monks think
they're intelligence agents.
Protect them, protect them.
But there were some real
intelligence people in the street.
And they tried to grab our reporters.
So now the monks
protected the reporters -
- and took them into their lines.
From now on our guys could
walk freely with the monks.
We could really work together.
One protester in the streets cannot
do much; but there are thousands.
Maybe there are
Really it is the only force in
Burma who can scare the military.
And the government
made a very big mistake.
In a town near Mandalay
they beat up some monks.
In Buddhist thinking, we are
never, never allowed to do that.
So everybody was very upset -
- and the monks demanded
an apology from the government.
Monks are not supposed
to do political things.
But when the people
are suffering and starving, -
- sometimes they rise
to give them their support.
This has happened before,
even a thousand years back.
They turn their alms
bowls upside down.
They will no longer
take alms from the generals.
Only a few civilians
were following them.
People are under fear of the guns.
-Tens of thousands of monks!
- Only a hundred.
Mo, look! There are lots of them!
Only the monks can put
an end to the government.
We can't know
what's going to happen.
Three days without shooting.
-They won't dare to shoot the monks.
- You never know.
The government is cornered.
They must make a decision.
They may use an iron fist.
The government may fall.
People are very eager
to see our footage.
They just switch on
Democratic Voice of Burma.
They are waiting to see what
we are going to show them.
My people in Burma were working
very enthusiastically.
So I was full of energy.
Journalists from every
prominent media organization -
- were waiting to see our footage
coming out of Rangoon.
In Burma hundreds of monks have
been protesting for a third day -
- after a significant rise
in fuel prices -
- prompted a wave
of public discontent.
The BBC has obtained
exclusive images.
To protest here is
to risk gaol and torture.
But for today and for the past
month people across Burma -
- dared to challenge one of the
world's most oppressive regimes.
The demonstrations are
being led by Buddhist monks, -
- a powerful force
in a devout nation.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Your Reverence...
What you monks are doing is great.
People are beginning to join
and the movement is growing.
Yes.
I think this religious protest
could turn into a political one.
What if we invite the public to join?
Would it be fruitful?
I think it will be very useful.
That's my opinion, anyway.
We will call an urgent meeting
to see how we can organize this.
- So you'll issue a statement?
- Of course!
We really want the public
to take part.
So far it has only been religious.
The public will make it political.
That's exciting news.
We young monks who follow Buddha's
teachings must join the protest.
Let's have a rehearsal.
I'll start, and you follow.
- Reconciliation now!
- Our cause, our cause!
- Reconciliation now!
- Our cause, our cause!
- We demand a dialogue!
- Our cause, our cause!
Free all political prisoners
and Aung San Suu Kyi too!
- Did you hear that?
- Unbelievable.
They're really doing it!
We must be careful
during the demonstration.
Everybody must be disciplined.
We will leave from the Eastern gate
and proceed down Baham Street.
One of our reporters was always at
the front of the demonstrations,
- working with
the leaders of the monks.
Go further ahead, turn left,
and more people will join you.
So he makes suggestions to the
monks about which way to go.
He tells them where
they'll get the most support -
- and people will
join the demonstrations.
OK, we'll start from
the Morthern gate instead.
Everybody please move
to the Northern gate!
May all beings living to the East
All beings of the universe,
be free!
Free from fear
Free from all distress
Free from poverty...
May they have peace
in their hearts...
May all beings living to the East
All beings of the universe,
be free!
Free from fear
Free from all distress
Free from poverty...
May they have peace
in their hearts...
- Reconciliation now!
- Our cause, our cause...
- Reconciliation now!
- Our cause, our cause!
Film them, film them all!
So many, so many!
- We demand a dialogue!
- Our cause, our cause!
We are doing this
for our future generations.
- Hello?
- Brother, it's fantastic!
- Where are you now?
-They've just passed Yuzana Plaza.
How many of them? Thousands?
Tens of thousands! You'll love
the footage we are getting.
They're shouting all the slogans.
- Everything is possible now!
- Let's hope so.
- Free Aung San Suu Kyi!
- Our cause, our cause...
The monks' demands
are our demands!
- Can you zoom onto the back?
-There's no end to it!
Just ordinary people.
- It's been 1 9 years.
- Yes, we've been waiting 1 9 years.
1 9 years!
-This will be the final match.
- Yes, the final match.
Today up to 1 00 000 people
took to the streets of Rangoon -.
- a protest that has grown in size
and confidence in the last 6 days.
... military dictatorship...
... thousands marching...
- Free Aung San Suu Kyi!
- Our cause, our cause!
The monks have come
to symbolize dissent, -
- a quiet, patient, peaceful
rebuke to military brutality, -
- and the chance of
an alternative Burma.
Millions of people
are watching our footage.
Our network is really small.
We don't have manpower.
We have to rely on handicams.
Film it, film it!
But the things we did
shook up the people of Burma -
- as well as people
around the world.
That really happened.
It is our dream coming true.
- Free Aung San Suu Kyi!
- Our cause, our cause!
Clap your hands!
- Hello.
- Can you hear me?
The generals have got to respond.
They have to release
Aung San Suu Kyi.
- That would be great.
- It's the only way, brother.
Americans are outraged
by the situation in Burma -
- where a military junta has
imposed a 1 9 year reign of fear.
The regime is holding more
than 1 000 political prisoners, -
- including Aung San Suu Kyi.
Yet the people's desire for
freedom is unmistakable.
... vowing to bring down
a repressive military government.
The last time anybody
defied the generals like this -
- the army killed 3000 people.
What will they do this time?
- Free Aung San Suu Kyi!
- Our cause, our cause!
They removed the road blocks in
front of Aung San Suu Kyi's house!
Who gave the order?
I don't know.
Some local commander.
Monks and people are
on their way there.
Can you hear the chanting?
Yes, it's beautiful.
Will you be shooting it?
I'm running out of battery.
I'll try and use the cell phone.
Yeah, you have got
to catch it somehow.
The detained opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi, -
- has been seen in public for
the first time in several years.
Thousands of Buddhist monks -
- were allowed to walk past
police barricades to her home.
I was crying -
- when I hear that monks are going
to Aung San Suu Kyi's home.
She came out to the gate. She gave
respect to the monks with tears.
Everybody who saw this was
crying at the time; and me, too.
In front of the computer.
It is not a good photo.
You can only see a small lady -
- but we couldn't see her
for a long time.
She is still under custody,
you know, house arrest.
They have tried to make
the people forget her.
But she is still in our hearts.
It is very dangerous for
the monks to go and see her.
In the 1 990s
the generals made a big mistake.
They held an election and
almost everybody voted for her.
It was like she made
the whole people forget their fear.
The generals will
be very scared -
- of this happening again.
They will begin to do
something after that.
My... my thought was true.
Hello.
Hello. Can you hear me?
Yes, where are you?
We are passing the road to
Aung San Suu Kyi's house.
Has she met with the monks again?
We need better pictures this time.
- Well...
- Hello?
It's not going to happen, brother.
She is heavily guarded today.
- Oh, shit.
- Mot good. Actually, very bad.
To the residents of Rangoon:
Gatherings of more than
five individuals are forbidden.
The decisive time was when
the government announced -
- not to gather more than
five people in the streets.
So I was confused.
That day I couldn't sleep.
You know... "Is it over?"
Two...
Three...
Four...
Five...
Six!
Great!
Oh, there's a lot!
Great!
When I see monks and
people come out that day -
- I feel it is the time
for our victory.
They just came out without fear.
But we are still waiting for
the army to join the people.
There are so many soldiers
who are suffering.
The lower ranks and privates.
But for an army man, -
- disobeying an order is
the most difficult decision.
They know their generals
are really cruel, really brutal.
They know more than us.
- Hello.
- I am here, at Shwedagon.
On the top platform.
- All the exits are blocked.
- OK. What's it like?
Very tense. Everyone
expects something to happen.
They've blocked the entrance
to prevent any gathering.
- Are you filming?
- Yes, from above.
The monks are trying to leave
but they're being surrounded.
I can see the car
of the chief of police.
- Are they going to make arrests?
-Two monks are negotiating.
Megotiating?
It's all very tense.
The monks are squatting
in front of the soldiers.
- Can the people not withdraw?
- No. The soldiers are blocking.
Soldiers are moving forward.
Look!
They are trying to grab the monks.
They are tearing off their clothes.
They are kicking the monks
and pushing them into trucks.
Don't turn off the camera!
Keep shooting!
- How many have they got?
- 20 monks on the trucks.
Look! Some of the monks
are trying to escape!
From the trucks?
They're using a trolley for cover.
They're throwing tear gas!
Soldiers are moving forward.
There is smoke all over.
I can't see a thing.
- Are they shooting?
-They are aiming their guns.
- I can't see a thing!
- Shit!
It's all smoke and pigeons.
The situation is bad.
Let's talk again later.
I have enough footage.
Good luck.
Take care.
Did you hear?
They beat them up -
- and dragged them onto trucks.
They are beating the monks!
Even the nuns!
The monks are fleeing because
the police are beating them.
- Did you hear?
- Yes, I heard.
Citizens, it's time
to abandon your fear!
Troops have fired tear gas
and warning shots -
- at demonstrators in
Burma today.
According to reports at least one
Buddhist monk has been killed.
Some of those monks
were really badly beaten -
- and yet the crowds were about
as large as on previous days.
It took time forthem to build up.
The anger is palpable on the streets.
This is a very dangerous moment -
- because if the security forces
can't control these protests -
- there is a real risk of lethal
force in the days ahead.
Calm down!
Please, no clapping!
We've seen amazing scenes of
defiance on the streets today.
Please sit down, everybody!
We, the monks, are not fighting for
our own interests but for the people.
I urge you to join hands with us.
- Will you join us?
- Yes!
- Improve the lives of the people!
- Our cause, our cause!
- Improve the lives of the people!
- Our cause, our cause!
- Reconciliation now!
- Our cause, our cause!
We can't overthrow
the regime by ourselves.
All the people need to participate.
So I urge the public to meet us -
- at Shwedagon
at 1 2 o'clock tomorrow.
We will continue our demonstrations
under the leadership of the monks.
The following edict has been issued
to the residents of Rangoon.
The authorities have
imposed a curfew.
Residents must remain in their
homes between 9 pm and 5 am...
- Hello?
- Joshua. It was so bad last night.
- Why, sister, why?
-They came to the monastery.
- And?
-They destroyed everything.
Soldiers beat up and
arrested the monks.
- People could hear them screaming.
- Did any of the monks escape?
I can't stand it any more. Please
send your friends to film it.
Don't worry. The whole world
is going to know about it.
I wonder where this guest is from?
I don't want to take any more risks.
- I am from DVB.
- Oh, DVB.
They drove through
the main door with a truck.
And they came in.
Once they were in
they beat up anyone they saw.
They destroyed
everything around them.
They tied us up and
forced us to kneel down.
They kicked us if we looked up.
- How many were taken away?
- There are 225 monks here.
We are all that is left.
About 50 of us.
I sent Kyaw Kyaw to the place.
He filmed the occasion.
And when he got
out of the monastery -
- he saw soldiers and thugs
coming to raid again.
The government troops
are coming back -
- to take all the
rest of the monks.
Later we found out that all the
rest of the monks were taken away.
And we don't really know
where they are now.
Bastards! Who can stop
them? I can't stand it.
You may think
what I'm about to say is cruel.
- Tell me.
- People have to get arrested.
-They have to die. Monks, too.
- Don't say that.
Our country is different
from the rest of the world.
I don't understand politics.
But I don't want to see
monks and people dying.
I can't stand it any more.
Be strong, my dear.
-They're gathering at the pagoda.
- Yes, let's get onto the footbridge.
Amazing!
The monks are still turning up!
I wonder how they manage.
They just don't care
about dying, do they?!
May all beings living to the East
All beings of the universe, be free!
Free from fear
Free from all distress
Free from poverty
May they have peace
in their hearts
This is a warning!
This unlawful assembly must
be ended within ten minutes -
or extreme action will be taken.
This unlawful assembly must
be ended within ten minutes -
- or extreme action will be taken.
OK, this is it!
Oh, my god!
- Hello?
- Can you hear me?
I can't hear because of the crowd.
I had to run away.
They are shooting.
What happened?
I was filming
when the soldiers came.
Are there many people injured?
I am not sure, but
they shot one guy point blank.
- Who did they shoot?
- A guy with a camera.
- Was he one of ours?
- Mo. He could be a foreigner.
- A foreigner?
- I'm not sure, but I got it on tape.
He was definitely not Burmese.
What, then?
We might have another angle.
He had white hair and fair skin.
I must have seen him before.
He was taking
pictures in front of me.
- Chinese or maybe Japanese.
- How was he dressed?
He was wearing a white
shirt and khaki shorts.
Then he's got to be Japanese.
-They really shot a foreign reporter?!
- Right in front of the camera.
This will make headlines.
Bloody smoke! I can't get a picture!
You bastards!
Stop it!
I am trying to film this!
Get out of the way!
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, I can hear you.
The crowd is moving up
Pazundaung Street. -
The crowd is growing.
Some are joining
from side streets.
The number is increas...
Hello?
Hello?
- Hello.
- Reverend monk! It's bad...
Many monks have been arrested.
Nobody knows where they are.
Some say they are in gaol.
I need to escape
to fight another day.
So I can't contact you any more?
You can try, but I will have to
disappear into the countryside.
I am not safe.
I have to go. Don't use the phone.
OK, OK, I hope to see you again.
Hello? Speak up!
Can you hear me?
I thought you'd been arrested.
What happened to you?
I'd rather not talk about it.
I've escaped death twice today.
AtTamwe there was shooting, too.
I had to climb over
the wall to escape.
I tried to get more pictures
but the soldiers closed in on me.
I didn't dare raise my head.
Shit!
Did you see anyone getting killed?
I was filming from my hiding place.
I didn't feel very happy about it.
Students were beaten
up in front of me.
A boy was shouting
that he was going to die.
That's hard to forget.
I was shocked.That's all.
- OK, OK, let's break off.
- OK.
In the late days of
September I began to think...
... "This is something
we have all seen before".
The monks were gone. Only the
students were left in the street, -
- just like 1 988.
And military trucks are going
around the city to chase them down.
They are surrounding us.
They are already there.
We must turn back.
Mo, we cannot retreat.
We can no longer get through.
We cannot retreat now.
Let's go with courage, then.
Even if we have to die.
We mustn't break up.
Those who are not afraid to die,
come to the front.
It's a dead end.
Don't run! If we must die, we will die.
Hide!
They're coming!
Climb higher!
Let's pray!
Let's pray to conquer our fear of
death!
Come on! Come quickly, everyone!
Get down! Get down!
They're shooting into the stairwell.
Throw them into the truck.
In the truck!
The uprising was dying.
There are only a few demonstrators
left in the streets of Rangoon.
During these guerilla
demonstrations -
- Ko Maung worked very well.
He is one of
the old fighters from 1 988.
So he knew the way
the demonstrators move.
Our cause! Our cause!
- Hello, Ko Maung. Speak up...
- Get their voices!
I can't use the camera!
- So the students are there?
- Yes, hurry, it's our last shot!
- Hold on...
-Troops are coming, you know!
You got it, you got it?
- OK, I'm recording.
- Who will speak to DVB? -
- Quick, quick!
Hello.
We will march in every street.
We will move on!
Can you hear what I'm saying?
We will keep demonstrating.
Two of us, four of us -
-... until we die!
Get that guy! he is a reporter!
That is how you stop the truth
coming out about a massacre.
A Japanese journalist
shot dead yesterday.
Today, the internet switched off, -
- and troops beating
those with cameras, -
- yelling "Is it you
who is sending pictures out?"
But the pictures have come out.
- Aung Tun?
- Can you hear me?
This morning there was a monk's
body floating in the nearby creek.
- What did you say?
- A dead monk.
- A dead monk?
- Yes.
- Is he still there?
- Must be. Lots of people saw him.
Perhaps you could go to film it?
It's too close to my house.
But I've asked someone else.
We can trust him.
Only the other day
they were beating up the monks.
Mow dead bodies are being seen.
This is the first one.
In the later days of September
Rangoon is like a war zone.
Nobody is
in the streets after 8 pm.
It is the city.
But it's like, you know, desert.
But our people are still working.
The situation's gotten worse since
the crackdown began last week.
Despite the information blackout
some images are still getting out.
We received images from
Democratic Voice of Burma, -
- the last media to be able to leak
information to the outside world.
They use satellite connections
to send it out of Burma.
Otherwise we wouldn't know
what was happening in Rangoon.
It is taking too long.
It has not even reached 1 megabyte.
We know that this video was
taken yesterday in Rangoon.
It shows that the repression
is still going on.
The Burmese authorities
are trying to calm things down, -
- saying that the protests are
over.This is not true.
We see here that it is still
very violent in Rangoon.
In the late days of September
generals were back in control.
Military people are hunting
any person with a camera.
We have to be very careful.
DVB are the worst!
The leaders in Oslo -
- are getting false pictures -
- from groups inside the country.
DVB are the ones who broadcast
most of the false news about s.
The Burmese military government
realize that DVB is the one -
- filming and smuggling all this
footage to international agencies.
So they systematically target
DVB reporters on the ground.
Everybody in our network
has spread out.
They are feeling that
they can be arrested at any time.
But we arranged
some hiding places.
- Myint Aung, are you OK?
- Yes. Last night was not nice.
Secret police came
knocking at every door.
Luckily they thought
my flat was empty.
It's too crazy here.
I am going up to Mandalay.
OK, good luck.
Hello, Ko Maung!
Hello? Hello?
Something strange
about Ko Maung.
His phone gets picked up
but nobody answers back.
I know.
He's been missing for hours.
- What do you reckon?
- It's not good.
- He'd have let us know.
- Do you think...?
Yes, he might be gone.
Hello?
Joshua, it's terrible.
They've taken headquarters!
What?
-Tun Zaw and Aung Win are lost.
- You mean arrested?
Arrested. I saw it all.
Secret police everywhere.
Tun Zaw just stared at me.
His face was all white.
- Oh, no!
- I pretended to be a stranger.
- Can you go back?
- Mo.They're clearing the place.
- Don't go home tonight.
- Mo. I'll try to warn the others.
Yes, hurry. And take care, now.
- I'll try.
- Promise me, will you?
Film them! Film them all!
So many!
So, so many!
It is just too much.
I feel hna myaw tal.
It is like something has been
broken and cannot be repaired.
But I'll just go on with my job.
Because we need to do it.
I'll go back to Burma.
I'll go through the mountains -
- and see what I can do.
A massive cyclone has hit the
military-ruled country of Burma.
50% of the buildings
are damaged or collapsed -
- in the worst-hit
Irrawaddy delta towns.
- Is it running?
- Yeah.
May I ask a question?
We're not from the government.
How many refugees
from the storm are here?
There are 456 refugees here.
How long have they been here?
Two days.
We've had no proper help.
We sleep where we can.
Are you all right?
We're just trying to survive.
We dug out some
shelters for ourselves.
