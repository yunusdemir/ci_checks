Now, the latest weather forecast
for northwest Koriko.
Skies are clearing up
thanks to a high-pressure front
moving in from the continent.
Mild winds will be
blowing in from the west,
clearing out the clouds by this evening.
We'll also have
a beautiful full moon tonight.
It will be sunny tomorrow
and it will be sunny
the day after tomorrow as well.
Next, the futures prices
from Karikiya Central
Produce Market...
Jiji, wake up. Tonight's the night.
Hey, Mom.
Hi, Miss Dora.
Hey, Mom, it's gonna be clear tonight.
And guess what?
The radio says there'll be a full moon.
Did you borrow your father's radio
again without asking?
He doesn't mind.
Please excuse me, Miss Dora.
Mom, it's a perfect midnight
for me to leave home.
You mean tonight?
Next month is what you told me.
But the next full moon
might be a cloudy night.
I want to leave on the perfect midnight.
But, Kiki... Wait.
My, oh, my. What's this all about?
It's one of our oldest customs
that when a witch turns 13,
she leaves home for a year
to begin her training.
Your little baby is 13?
My goodness, but time flies so quickly.
I know. She seems so young
to be leaving home now.
I remember very well the exact day
you arrived in this town.
A little girl flew down from the sky
on her broomstick.
Her eyes were twinkling
with excitement,
and she looked confident as well.
But Kiki doesn't know much
besides flying.
I've had no time to teach her
how to mix potions like I do.
Sign of the times, I'm afraid.
Everything changes, bit by bit.
Too bad that you didn't get to teach her
the potion for my rheumatism.
You're always telling me to hurry.
Now who's the slowpoke?
I think it's better to leave
with decorum and great dignity.
If we put it off for a month, and I find
a boyfriend, then what'll we do?
We'll never leave.
I'm quite concerned
you didn't really think this through.
Oh, are you?
I'm as excited about making this trip
as opening a birthday present!
Dad.
Dad. Guess what?
I've decided to leave tonight.
- You're going away?
- I just decided today.
Well, yes, but what about
our camping trip this weekend?
Sorry, Dad.
Kiki, wait.
Yeah, I'll expect you then. Thanks.
Mom, it's me. I wanted to make sure
you knew that Kiki is leaving tonight.
Yes, midnight.
- Very pretty.
- Lilac would look prettier on me.
Witches have worn this color
for a very long time.
Black cat, black clothes.
It's not important
what color your dress is.
What matters is the heart inside.
I know having a good heart is important.
You can trust me.
Just follow your heart and keep smiling.
Yeah.
Be sure to write home
as soon as you're settled.
Dad. Can I please take the radio?
Mom, didn't you say
I could have the radio?
All right. It's yours already.
Okay. Now let me have a look
at my little witch.
You look like your mother
when she was young.
Dad, can you lift me up high,
like when I was little?
Well...
How come you never told me
you were growing up so fast?
If things don't work out,
you can always come home.
And come back a failure?
I hope you find a good town.
- What a beautiful moon.
- I agree.
I bet it's real tough
to find a town to live in by yourself.
Don't worry. Kiki will be fine.
- What kind of town are you looking for?
- A big town?
Yeah. By the ocean, I hope.
I'm so jealous of you.
But I'm not going just for a good time.
To be a good witch, I have to train
for a year away from home.
Yeah. Be sure to tell that to the boys.
Kiki, it's time.
Okay.
That's the broom you're leaving on?
Yep. I just made it this morning
all by myself.
It's too small to be really safe.
I'd rather you took mine.
I know it better.
- But, Mom, that one's so old.
- And that's why it's good.
You can rely on it time after time
in any kind of weather.
Now, Kiki, do this for me, please.
But I put so much work into this one.
Right, Jiji?
Your broom is nice,
but let's take your mother's.
You're no help.
Kiki, can't you make yourself another
fine broom when you get settled down?
Be careful.
- You be strong.
- I will.
- Bye, Kiki.
- Fly safely.
- Go get 'em.
- Goodbye!
Aim your broomstick.
Sounds like she's off safely.
I'm going to miss
the wonderful sound of those bells.
- Where are we going?
- I'm headed south to see the ocean.
Jiji, climb up and turn on the radio.
I don't think I can handle it.
Can you do it?
Kiki's Delivery Service
Hey. Good evening.
Oh, hello.
You're new, aren't you?
Yes! I just left home tonight.
Would you mind turning off that radio?
- I prefer to fly without being distracted.
- Oh.
Could you tell me, is it really hard
to get settled in a new city?
Yes. A lot can go wrong.
But since my skill is fortune-telling,
I can handle anything.
- Fortune-telling?
- Yes. I tell fortunes about love.
And what exactly is your skill?
Well, I haven't really decided that yet.
Well, I'm nearly finished
with my training period.
I'm going home soon
to show off my new skills.
That's my town down there.
It's not big or terribly interesting,
but I like it.
- Hope you don't have too tough a time.
- Thanks.
Bye!
Jeez, what a snob.
And did you see that cat?
What's my skill?
What was that about good weather?
I hope you're not going to do
what I think you are.
We'd better rest here until it's dry.
- Won't we get in trouble?
- Not if nobody finds us.
I'm soaked through, down to the bone.
Do you feel anything moving?
This smells great.
Sorry. We didn't mean to fall asleep
in your breakfast.
Jiji, you've gotta come see the ocean.
It's beautiful.
Big deal. It's just a big puddle of water.
Look. Up ahead.
How lovely.
- I wonder if they have a witch there.
- I don't know.
Let's go.
You okay back there?
Fine.
Look! It looks like
it's floating on the ocean.
A clock tower. A place like this
would be great to live in.
But there may be some witches
living here already.
And there may not be.
Look at how many people there are.
Too many, if you ask me.
Bless my hourglass.
It's a real, live witch.
Good morning.
Do any witches live in this town?
Nobody's seen one around here
in a long time.
Great. Our trip is over.
We're staying right here.
- Thanks, mister. Bye.
- No problem.
- Tell me we're not landing down there.
- Well, of course we are.
- They're looking at us.
- I know.
Smile, so we make a good impression.
Hi. My name's Kiki, and I'm a witch.
And this is Jiji. He's my black cat.
And we'd be honored
if we could live here.
Your city is so amazing.
And what a beautiful clock tower.
Really? That's very nice, dear. Bye.
Hey, you, kid.
Don't jump out into the street!
You were responsible
for a big accident,
zooming around on your broom.
I'm a new witch.
We're supposed to fly around.
You're supposed to obey the law.
I'll have to write you up.
- Will you tell my parents?
- Of course I'll tell your parents.
- I have to do that with every minor.
- Thief!
Thief!
Thief!
Now you stay right there.
Kiki?
Miss. Wait up.
I sure fooled that cop, huh?
Hey, that was me yelling "thief."
You must be a real witch, huh?
I saw you fly.
Wow, I didn't know you guys
actually use brooms to fly.
Do you think
you can teach me how to fly it?
Hey, Tombo.
Isn't it a bit early for girl hunting?
Hey, shut up, all right?
You know, miss, I love flying, too.
Could I see your broom?
Thanks for getting me out of trouble,
but I didn't ask for your help.
It's very rude to talk to a girl
before you've been introduced
and know her name.
You're kind of old-fashioned.
You sound like my grandmother.
Just go away and leave me alone.
What a cool witch.
Stay here tonight?
Your parents are here, aren't they?
No, sir, I'm alone.
I've come here
as a new witch in training.
Do you have some identification?
Oh, never mind.
- Aren't you going to eat that?
- No, you can have it, Jiji.
It's getting late.
Let's go.
Why don't we go find another town?
I'll bet there are bigger and better ones.
Ones that are friendlier than this.
Hey, there! Your pacifier!
Ma'am!
Poor baby.
Without this, the baby'll wake up
and cry all the way home.
I'm sorry, folks. But could you wait
just a minute? I'll be right back.
Excuse me. But would you like me
to deliver it for you?
What?
The woman with the baby carriage
who just went off.
Really? You'd do that?
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.
Let's go, Jiji.
Sorry to surprise you. The lady in the
bakery asked me to return this pacifier.
Here you go.
Yes, sir. Oh, hi, there.
Come in and wait a minute, will you?
There you are.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Now, come back again.
When I saw you fly off,
I thought for a second I was dreaming.
The baby's mother told me
to give you this message.
"Thanks for returning the pacifier.
"Your new delivery girl
is really quite special."
- Well, I'll be on my way.
- Wait.
I really must do something
to show you my thanks.
Oh, hey.
Follow me.
Sit down and relax.
Would you like some coffee?
Okay.
- Thank you very much, ma'am.
- And this is for you, little guy.
Let me guess.
You're a witch in training.
Yes, but people don't seem fond
of witches in this town.
Depends on the people.
Now, take me, for instance.
I just met you and I know I like you.
Whereabouts are you two staying?
Why didn't you tell me
you have no place to stay?
We have a spare room in the attic.
You can use that.
Really, ma'am?
Don't call me "ma'am."
My name's Osono.
And I'm Kiki.
Jiji here is my very best friend.
- It's not very clean, but it's all yours.
- That's okay.
Bathroom's downstairs.
Tell me if you need anything.
Thank you.
There's flour everywhere.
If you wake up tomorrow
and find a white cat, it's me.
Jiji, we can see the ocean from here.
Can we look for a new town?
The Spirit of Freedom left the ground
today heading to Antarctica...
Pardon me, Miss Snooty Cat.
I've decided not to leave this town.
Maybe I can find
some nice people like Osono
who will accept me for who I am.
How much do you think it would cost
to get a phone here?
- A phone?
- Yep. For my business.
- Good morning, everyone.
- Morning!
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes. That smells good.
- Can I help out?
- Sure can.
A delivery business?
I only have one skill, that's flying.
I thought a delivery service
would be good.
It's a great idea.
Kiki's Flying Delivery Service.
And you can base the business
out of your room upstairs.
You mean it? That's great.
- I was thinking of a phone upstairs.
- But a phone is expensive.
I have some savings.
Don't waste your money.
What I think you should do
is use our phone.
It will take some time
to get regular customers.
I'm expecting a baby and need help.
If you mind the store once in a while,
you can have the room and phone.
And I'll throw in a free breakfast, okay?
Yeah. We've got a deal.
I'm gonna work very hard for you.
Osono, you're the greatest.
Jiji, come on. I'm all through.
We're gonna go shopping. Come on.
In the city,
you can't just run out into the street.
I'm sorry. We're still alive, aren't we?
I've never been more embarrassed
in my whole life.
- It was so terrible.
- Yeah.
I wish I had something pretty to wear.
My dress is so ugly.
This costs so much.
Kiki, look. It's me.
Any money left, Kiki?
Looks like all we can afford to eat now
is pancakes.
Aren't they beautiful?
Hey. Pull over.
Hey there.
What a cutie.
Not flying today?
See? I told you guys
she wears a black dress.
Wait. Come back, please.
I didn't mean to insult you.
- Yeah.
- Better luck next time, Tombo.
Perfect timing. There's a lady here
who wants you to make a delivery.
- She's your first customer.
- Customer? I'll be right back.
Now, where's that map?
Dear, this lady is a customer of ours,
and we were talking
about your new delivery service.
- What a charming girl.
- My name's Kiki, ma'am.
Do you think you can
deliver this by tonight?
Yeah. I can.
It's a birthday gift for my nephew.
Something came up at work.
I can't make it to the party on time.
Where should I deliver it?
But that's me.
Are you sure it won't be too far?
- I can fly straight there.
- Great. How much will it cost?
I haven't really thought about a price.
How about this much, then?
This much for me?
That's great. Thank you.
That's great.
- She's the most amazing girl.
- She sure is.
Wait. Do you know her?
Kiki, how high do you intend to go?
This is my first job, and I do not want
to be stopped by that traffic cop.
I was afraid you were going to
deliver it to the angels.
It's just past the cape.
- Here we go.
- Whoa, boy.
I'm getting to like this town
more and more.
You'd better be sure about that.
I can't wait to write Mom and Dad
about my new business.
Look who's behind us. Wild geese.
And they're coming with us.
- They seem upset.
- They say they're going to fly higher.
They say a gust of wind's coming.
I didn't mean to... I'm sorry!
I wasn't trying
to steal your eggs. Really.
Oh, my goodness.
That was your fault.
The geese warned us of that wind.
You're right.
That gust of wind
took them all the way up.
Kiki. The toy fell out.
We've gotta go back.
- Oh, no! Where?
- Where we fell.
They're saying,
"The egg thief's coming again."
What are we gonna do?
Hey. Stop that! Go away.
Leave us alone. Stop it.
Maybe we better rethink our plan.
Frankly, I think this is a major insult.
Crows used to serve witches
and do what you said.
Hey, that was a long time ago, okay?
How about if we go in after dark?
Go in. Get it. Get out.
We won't be able to make it in time.
Unless we buy ourselves some time.
You've gotta be kidding.
You can just pretend to be the doll
until I find the real one.
- Is that the place?
- Yes. Don't move a muscle.
- Can I breathe?
- Hold it as long as you can.
Yay! A gift from my auntie.
This is dumb.
You're a bit late.
After my sister phoned,
we wondered where you were.
I'm sorry.
Could I please have your signature?
Mom, can I put the canary in here?
Be sure not to let it fly away, Ket.
Okay.
Thank you very much. Have a nice day.
Come on, you stupid bird.
I got a brand-new home for you.
Please hurry, Kiki.
I know you fell close by,
so you've got to be here somewhere.
There you are.
Hello. Anyone home?
Is anybody here? Anybody? Hello?
- Anybody here?
- Yes.
I'm on the roof. What do you want?
Why don't you come up?
What do you want?
Oh, well, you have a black cat
in your cabin window,
and, you see,
it's mine and I need it back.
Good birdie. Stay still.
So, why was it alone in the forest?
That's where I dropped it.
May I have it back, please?
I really need to finish this.
That's my girl.
You're just about through, okay?
Why didn't you tell me
why you needed it in such a hurry?
- I got sort of fond of it.
- Thank you.
His head's falling off.
Must have been the crows.
They were making a fuss.
This is terrible. I can't
deliver it like this.
I know. How about we work out a deal?
You're on your own at 13.
That's exciting. I'd like that.
- How's it going?
- Trust me. He'll be good as new.
Ket, dear.
Ket, time for your bath. Quickly.
The guests will be here soon.
Ket.
- I'm done.
- Thank you very much.
- Better go get Jiji before it's too late.
- But I haven't finished.
Don't worry.
That's enough. Go and get him.
Thanks.
Jeff likes my present more than me.
Jeff's such a funny dog. He adores
that stuffed cat. He won't leave it alone.
I'll bet he thinks it's a puppy.
Your sister's not going to be happy
to hear that.
That's okay. I gave it to Jeff anyway.
Just don't forget to send your aunt
a thank-you note.
He's getting to be such an old dog.
Be kind to him, Ket.
- Yeah. All he does is sleep all day.
- All day.
Ket, dear, go open the door.
- Jeff wants to go out.
- Sure.
Jeff, shut the door
when you're done. Okay?
- Jiji!
- What took you so long?
- I'm sorry.
- My friend, Jeff, helped me escape.
He said he'd be happy
to help us out if he could.
Could you take this in, please?
- How are you feeling?
- I'm hungry.
Yeah, me, too. And very tired.
But it sure was a wonderful adventure.
That painter who found the stuffed cat
told me she wants to do
a drawing of me.
- Naked?
- Jiji.
Kiki's Delivery Service
Kiki's Delivery Service
Boring.
Wake up. You're supposed to be
minding the store.
I am, but there aren't any customers.
But it always gets busy about this time.
I know that. That's not what I mean.
I mean my customers.
If nobody comes in,
I'm gonna have to eat pancakes forever
and be fat, fat, fat.
And what am I supposed
to do about that?
Well, I like pancakes,
provided they're not burned.
Look, fur ball, when you get as fat
and round as a pancake,
you see if I care.
Beautiful, isn't she?
They tell me she's a clothes designer.
Her designs may be fabulous,
but her cat's still a snob.
Hello. Good Cooking Pan Bakery.
What? Pardon? Yes, ma'am.
About time we got a customer, huh?
Yes, ma'am, 4:30 will be
a perfect time to pick it up.
And the address?
Yes. The blue roof. Right.
Yeah. I'm pretty sure I have it all.
And thank you very much, ma'am.
Hi.
I'll take this, please. Okay?
- Thank you very much. Good afternoon.
- You're not still mad at me, are you?
We're gonna have a party
at the club tonight.
It's called the Aviation Club,
and we'd really like you to come.
Here's your invitation.
It really is a serious club.
I'd be really excited if you came.
- Yes. May I help you, sir?
- I hear you have a delivery service.
Yes, I do. What can I do for you?
It's very urgent this package arrive
as soon as possible.
That's no problem.
- Are you all right?
- Sure.
- Can I help you?
- Nope.
I hope you make up your mind by 6:00.
That's when I'll pick you up.
- See you.
- How much will that be?
Will that be inside
or outside city limits, sir?
- I wrote the address on the box.
- Oh, the box. I'm sorry.
Osono!
I got an invitation to go to a party
at Tombo's flying club.
I'm sure it'll be a great party.
But my problem is,
what am I going to wear?
Kiki, you haven't got a problem.
You look fine in that.
Black makes you look
beautiful and mysterious.
- Really?
- How's work?
I almost forgot about that.
It's already 4:00. Oh, no.
Can you watch the store
until I get back?
Jiji?
You were so mad at that boy.
I don't know why
you're going to his party.
Please don't talk.
I'm trying to fly this broom, okay?
Thank you very much. Bye.
Come on, Jiji.
We can't keep
our next appointment waiting.
There's the blue roof.
My name's Kiki, and someone
telephoned for a delivery service,
so here I am.
Right this way, dear.
- You are right on time.
- Thank you.
Oh, madam, the delivery girl is here.
My, delivery time already?
Come in, dear.
Please make yourself right at home.
- Please do.
- Thanks.
May I take that for you?
Broom and a black cat.
Well, it's just as
my great-grandmother told me.
My name's Kiki, and I'm a witch.
Oh, my, what a pretty witch you are.
I'm sorry, but that special treat
you were supposed to deliver
isn't ready.
I think there's something wrong with it.
It's got a mind of its own,
and it doesn't want to heat up.
It's old. Like me, it's seen better days.
I was hoping you could deliver a dish
to my granddaughter's birthday party.
It's my specialty,
herring and pumpkin potpie.
But I must admit defeat.
I'll have to phone her
and tell her I'm sorry.
I feel just awful
having you come here for nothing.
Barsa.
Would you get Kiki's money, please?
Certainly, madam.
- All of it. Pay her what we agreed on.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
Please accept it. This was all my fault.
Ma'am, since I don't have
any other jobs, maybe I can help.
How about using that oven over there?
Well, maybe.
It used to bake beautiful bread,
but I haven't baked in it lately.
Well, if it burns firewood,
I can help you.
I used to help my mom bake
all the time.
But it's such a big job to build a fire.
A great idea, ma'am.
I never liked that electric thing.
- We have wood for the fireplace.
- Ma'am, it'll work, really.
You think so? All right then. Let's try it.
What if you're late for your party?
I can't take her money and not help out.
Okay, Jiji, let's go.
Madam, here. Look what I found.
You're a very clever girl, my dear.
Your mother must be proud.
Oh, well, this is exciting.
Yes, this is much better.
It should be about time.
Yes, very good. Well done.
Now, we wait.
You think 40 minutes
should be about right?
Exactly right. So let's take a little break.
I can help around the house
while it bakes.
How nice of you to offer.
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.
You're never gonna
make the party on time.
Stop worrying-
It'll only take me 15 minutes
if I fly there fast.
Would you like some hot tea?
It's no trouble.
What did you say to me
was the time of your party?
It's at 6:00,
but it's only 15 minutes away.
Goodness.
My clock runs about 10 minutes slow.
- I'm gonna be late.
- Check if the potpie is ready.
Help. Barsa, come.
- Is the pie baked? Is it ready?
- It seems fine. You'd better hurry.
- I got the broom. Hurry.
- Yes.
Let me pay you for your time.
- But that's much too much.
- Not for all of your help.
Hurry up!
- Have a good time, now.
- Here you go.
What happened
to all that good weather?
My whiskers are tingling.
Could we get out of the rain?
We can't. That'll make us even later,
and the food will get cold if we stop.
Yes? What do you want?
- I have a delivery.
- But it is soaking wet.
I'm sorry. It began to rain on the way.
But don't worry. The food is all right.
- I told Grandma I didn't want that.
- Hey, what'd you get?
Oh, Grandma sent me another one
of her crummy herring pies again.
Will you please sign
this receipt for me?
I hate Grandma's stupid pies.
I cannot believe they're related.
Maybe we still have time.
Kiki, there he is.
Come on. We can catch him.
We were all so worried about you.
And that poor boy waited a long time.
It doesn't matter anyway.
I can't go in these wet clothes.
Kiki, what's wrong?
Are you not feeling well?
Maybe we should eat something, okay?
Wake up, Kiki.
Not feeling very well, huh?
- You have quite a fever.
- My head's hurting so much.
You flew in that weather
and you never really dried off.
Do you think I'm going to die, Osono?
No, you're not.
I'll bring some medicine right up,
and you should have something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
You have to eat something,
even you're not hungry.
How about some nice hot oatmeal
with honey? You want some, too?
This oatmeal will pick you right up.
There you go. Here.
Now, don't burn your tongue.
You should come and eat your meal
while it's warm.
- Do you think you can get up?
- Do I have to eat it?
Only if you want to get well.
You know, that boy stopped by
to see you again today.
When I told him you were sick,
he asked how a witch could catch cold
in the first place.
And he said
he wanted to visit you later.
Oh, my gosh. No.
I thought you might feel that way,
so I turned him down politely.
You must be tired.
You try and get some sleep.
I'll open the window
so you'll have some fresh air.
- Osono?
- Yeah?
Never mind.
Jiji!
Jiji!
What?
- Where are you?
- Kiki?
- Are you feeling better?
- A lot better. Thank you.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize I'd overslept.
That's okay. Come down later.
I have a favor to ask you.
- All right?
- Okay.
- The name is "Koppori"?
- Now, take this money.
Oh, it's on me. It's so close
that I can even walk there.
Impossible. Work is work,
and make sure you deliver it in person.
Jiji.
- What is it?
- We've got a delivery.
- Who's your friend there?
- Lily's her name. Be right there.
Stay there. I'll be right back.
He's all yours. Bye-bye!
It's so pretty and warm.
Hey. Hey there, Miss Witch.
Taking a walk?
I'm looking for someone
named Koppori.
That's my name. That's me.
If you go around that way,
I'll be right with you, okay?
Osono, how could you do this to me?
Gee, thanks a lot.
About the other night,
I'm sorry I didn't show up.
I'm sorry you had
to end up so sick like that.
Hey, come over to my place.
There's something I wanna show you.
You gotta see it.
The party was to celebrate
the completion of this.
This is the engine
of a man-propelled plane.
Watch this.
We're assembling the wings and frame
at somebody else's house.
I'm planning on flying this thing
by the end of the summer vacation.
Why don't we go down to the beach
where that dirigible landed yesterday?
- Dirigible?
- Don't say you didn't hear about it?
- I was sick.
- Then we gotta see it. Let's do it.
- We're going on this?
- Why not?
I have to practice all the time anyway.
Gotta build up my legs.
Okay. Ready?
- This is my first time on a bike.
- Oh, boy. Just hold on.
Brace the bike with your foot
until I get her revved up. Let's go.
Okay.
- Should I get off?
- No.
Hey, look at that. Whoa.
Lean your body to the inside
when we go around the curve.
- Why?
- Otherwise, we'll have trouble turning.
Now.
Great. You're doing fine.
All right. We're doing great.
- That's the dirigible, right?
- Right.
We're flying.
Hey. Watch it.
What happened, Tombo? Are you okay?
- Yeah. Are you?
- I'm okay.
Do I really look that funny?
I'm sorry, but when we flew up,
I was so scared.
Yeah, me, too.
Was it your magic
that made us stay up?
I'm not sure. Anything's possible.
Your bike's a real mess.
My propeller. I have to go get it.
Will you keep an eye
on my bike for me?
- What went wrong?
- I think I pedaled too hard.
Wait here.
How great would it be to go
around the world in a dirigible like that?
How'd it make you feel,
the first time you ever flew?
I can't recall.
I was too young to remember.
But my mom told me
I wasn't scared a bit.
Gosh. You're so lucky, Kiki.
I wish I could fly.
You can just fly away on a broomstick.
But me? That's all I can do.
Flying used to be fun
until I started doing it for a living.
But being able to use your skills
for a living is great. I envy you.
I sort of feel my confidence slipping.
But I'm glad I came with you today.
I feel much better sitting by the beach.
Why don't I bring you here
when you want
and train myself at the same time?
- You're a very nice person.
- You just found that out?
I thought you were such a clown.
My mom says the same thing.
"Don't be such a clown.
"Quit looking at the sky.
Get back to your books."
- Tombo!
- What?
- Something really great.
- What?
Come on over.
I'll be back in a sec, okay?
We're all gonna get to go
inside the blimp.
Really? That's great.
- Hey, who's your friend?
- That's Kiki, the witch.
Come and meet the gang.
We're going for a tour
inside the Spirit of Freedom.
Thanks, but I don't want to.
Why not? It'll be fun.
She made a delivery
to my house on my birthday.
- You mean she's working, at her age?
- Well, I'll be.
Come on.
I'll introduce you to everybody.
- No thanks. See you later.
- Wait... What's the matter?
What are you so mad about?
I'm not mad at all.
I have a lot of jobs to do.
So, please, just leave me alone.
Forget her, Tombo. Come on.
Jiji, I think something's wrong with me.
I make friends, then suddenly
I can't bear to be with any of them.
Seems like that other me, the cheerful
and honest one, went away somewhere.
Some friend you are.
Kiki's Delivery Service
You know, you can't be late
for every meal
just because you have a new girlfriend.
And you can wash your plate yourself.
Why are you talking like a cat?
Jiji?
Oh, no. Talk to me.
Can you say "Kiki"?
Jiji!
What's going on with him?
I can't understand anything
he's trying to say.
What if it means... Oh, my goodness.
I'm losing my witch's powers.
What do you mean?
You haven't lost your magic, have you?
It's become very weak, so I...
I think I've got to take a break
from my delivery work.
I promise I'll be good
with my bakery work,
so please let me stay upstairs.
Well, that's no problem.
I'll bet your powers come back
after some rest.
I really don't know.
Maybe if I make a new broom.
Hey. Look at that.
It's me, Tombo.
Did you see me today?
I was waving from the dirigible.
The captain took me on the test flight.
Boy, did I have a cool time.
- Hello? Kiki? Are you there?
- Please don't call me anymore.
What did you say?
I can barely hear you.
The captain said
he'd like to meet you...
What? Kiki?
What's the matter?
You look like a ghost.
I'm still in training to become a witch.
If I lose my magic, that means
I've lost absolutely everything.
Kiki.
Hi.
Well, since you didn't come
and visit me,
- I thought I'd come and visit you.
- I'm sorry.
That's a white lie.
I need to do some shopping.
Come on in, 'cause I'm done now,
and I can take a break, okay?
You better believe I will.
Nice place you have.
Help yourself to these.
I'll make some tea.
No tea, thanks.
Some milk, if you have any.
Sure.
Unbelievable. You're the spitting image
of that stuffed cat.
I bet your name's Jiji, right?
How's the delivery biz?
You making any money?
- That bad?
- I'm not working much now.
I kind of thought you looked unhappy.
I didn't know things like that
happened to witches.
Why don't you come
and stay at my cabin?
It'll make you feel better.
Your boss would let you come.
How about it? Wanna come?
Rather be with your girlfriend?
Come on. Why not? We'll leave now.
Hurry.
Okay, now I'm officially exhausted.
It's beautiful here.
Must've been blind,
with two beautiful girls in front of him.
You really thought I was a boy?
Well, it's the way
you're dressed and all.
Tell me. What kind of a boy
has these legs, mister?
- Lots of crows.
- We've become close friends.
Hello, everybody. I'm home again.
Good afternoon.
Sorry I bothered you before.
Why don't you go inside,
and I'll go get some water?
- Like it?
- Yes.
I have to say, I became inspired
after the first time we met.
But I really haven't got the face right.
I've been waiting for you to come back
so I can try again.
- You mean, that's me?
- Sure is.
You'd make my life easier
if you'd model for me.
But I'm not very beautiful.
Come on, Kiki.
You have got a great face.
Now, don't you be nervous.
Sit down over here.
Raise your chin up a little.
Look straight ahead. Now, don't move.
Painting and magical powers
seem very similar.
Sometimes I'm unable to paint a thing.
You mean it?
Then what? What happens?
Kiki, please, don't move.
Without even thinking about it,
I used to be able to fly.
Now I'm trying to look inside myself
to find out how I did it.
At times like that,
you know what I do? Paint.
That gets rid of my frustrations.
Yeah, but still, if I can't fly...
Then stop trying. Take long walks.
Look at the scenery. Doze off at noon.
I wouldn't even think about painting.
Then, pretty soon,
I would want to paint like crazy.
- You think it's the same for me?
- Sure, it is.
Now, show me your side again.
When I was your age,
I'd already decided to be an artist.
I loved to paint so much.
I'd paint all day
until I fell asleep at my easel.
Then, one day, for some reason,
I couldn't paint anymore.
I tried and tried,
but nothing I did seemed any good.
They were copies of paintings
I'd seen somewhere before,
and not very good copies, either.
I just realized that
I had to paint my painting.
Did you struggle a lot?
I still do.
But after that, I understood better
what it means to paint.
When you fly, you rely
on what's inside of you, don't you?
We fly with our spirit.
Trusting your spirit.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
That same spirit
is what makes me paint
and makes your friend bake.
I suppose it must be
a power given by God.
Sometimes you suffer for it.
I guess I never gave witchcraft
much thought.
That talk about discipline and training
was so old-fashioned.
I was so happy that you came
all that way to see me.
If I had been alone tonight, I would've
been one giant ball of frustration.
There have been many times
I've thought of painting over
that painting.
But it ended up being so great.
When I saw you today, I looked at your
sad face and thought, "I've found it."
- I knew I could paint you.
- But that's not fair.
All's fair in love and art.
Let's turn out the lights and go to sleep.
Sorry about taking your bed from you.
No problem.
- Can I visit you once in a while?
- Sure.
Anytime during the summer.
That is, if I can visit you, too.
There it is, the Spirit of Freedom,
downed in a spectacular
forced landing
due to torrential rains
just outside the city limits.
It's been repaired.
Yes? Good Cooking Pan Bakery.
Kiki. How are you?
Well, you take plenty of time
coming home.
By the way,
that old lady you made a delivery for?
She has another delivery.
I said I wasn't sure you could do it.
She was really very insistent.
What do you think, Kiki?
Great. Stop there
on your way back. Bye.
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Well, well, we've been expecting you.
There are less than five minutes
to takeoff now.
It's very nice to see you again, ma'am.
I'm glad you came.
Please excuse me for not standing.
My legs are bothering me
more than usual.
Barsa, bring the package now.
Gosh, I hope it hasn't taken off.
Not yet. Barsa is absolutely mad
about lighter-than-air travel.
I'm the adventuresome type.
Could you turn it down, please?
Would you do me a favor
and open the box?
Yes.
I don't get it.
Would you please bring this
to a young delivery girl?
She was kind to me
and a very big help.
It's my way of saying thank you.
Yes, and can you find out
when her next birthday is?
Then I can bake her another one.
Kiki?
Of course. Maybe the girl
will want to know the lady's birthday,
because she'll be able to give her
a present to repay her.
You've got a deal.
- What happened?
- There's been a terrible accident.
Oh, no. The tie-down ropes holding
the blimp are breaking one by one.
Darn this old thing.
And just when it was getting good.
Midsummer is always
when these winds come.
They'll be hitting us any minute.
It'll pass quickly. Don't worry.
It's back on. Look.
Oh, look at that.
It's completely upside down.
Freak winds blowing in from the sea.
- It has broken loose...
- My, my. How terrible.
A desperate effort is being made
to tie the dirigible to the ground
and keep it from drifting into the air,
but it's extremely doubtful
whether or not this can be done.
Oh, no, no. It's useless.
The lifting power of the helium balloon
is lifting the police car...
That's Tombo.
That's my friend hanging on that rope.
It's being lifted like a toy.
Oh, no, there's a young boy
hanging onto the cable.
He's being lifted away together
with the police car.
I don't believe what I'm seeing.
The dirigible
is being blown towards town.
- Are you sure it's your friend, dear?
- I have to go.
- Be careful.
- Oh, dear.
- Come on. Over here.
- Over here.
- Look. There he is.
- Look. It's a man up there.
Hold on there, son.
Just hold your grip steady.
Release the helium from the tail.
All citizens are kindly requested
to remain calm.
Sir, is there any word
about Tombo, the boy?
All I know is that
the police car dropped into a pool.
He's still up there.
The helium inside the dirigible
will not explode.
Stay out of the street.
Get on the sidewalks.
You, there. Young lady.
Are you all right, young lady?
Please, sir, may I use your deck brush?
- What?
- Please. I'll bring it right back.
- Well, maybe if you...
- Thank you very much.
Fly.
Oh, my goodness.
Straighten up and fly right,
or I'll burn you.
It appears that the blimp
is heading directly for the clock tower.
The boy is safe, but he's clutching
that rope for dear life.
If the wind doesn't shift,
it will smash into the tower.
We gotta get higher
or else we'll hit the tower, Captain.
There's not enough helium.
Jump onto the tower before we hit.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Hey, there. Over here. Come on.
- Get out of the way. It's gonna crash!
- Grab a hold of this.
Hurry up!
Really?
We are listening to a helium gas leak.
The boy's condition is unknown,
but from where I'm standing...
It's falling. Too much gas has escaped.
Run! Run!
It's snagged on the building
across the street...
- Look.
- It's a miracle.
The boy has managed
to keep his hold on the rope.
But how can anyone rescue him now?
That brave young boy
is hanging on for dear life.
He can't... Something just flew by.
It's a bird? No, it's not a bird.
It's a young girl.
It's a young witch flying on a broom...
No, on a brush?
- Go, Kiki!
- Oh, my.
- She can fly again.
- Get him, Kiki!
- Tombo.
- Kiki.
Come on now.
Be a good broom. Hold on, Tombo.
Hang in there, my good lad.
Tombo!
Kiki!
She's trying to reach the boy.
You can do it. Yes.
Don't give up now, sonny.
Don't give up. Don't give up.
Don't give up. Don't give up.
She got him. She saved the boy.
I've never seen anything so amazing.
She's bringing him down,
safe and sound.
What a miracle! The crew members
on the blimp seem to be okay, too.
That brush she used was mine.
That was my deck brush.
Oh, Barsa. Oh, my.
Kiki was so brave.
She really saved the day.
Better call the hospital, honey.
I think it's time now.
Jiji.
Listen, we just got a letter from Kiki.
"Dear Mother and Father,
how are you doing?
"Jiji and I are doing fine at the moment."
"Regarding my work,
everything is falling into place.
"I'm starting to gain some confidence.
"There are still some times
when I feel homesick,
"but all in all, I sure love this city."
