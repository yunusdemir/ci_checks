A naked baby screaming

<i>Picture it now.</i>
O.K.

# I love Paris
in the springtime #
# I love--#
Hello? Hello?
I really thinkyou gave me
the wrong mantra.
<i>Oh?</i>
I don't love Paris,
I don't like the French,
and I don't want
to go on this trip.
Oh...God, no!
<i>Kate,you can do this.</i>
I can't do this!
I don't belong
on this airplane!
Let me out of here!
I don't want to die!
Who-ohhh!
Kate,yourfull refund.
Thankyou.
You can get
the money back
on my ticket.
Money's not
the issue, Kate.
I wanted you to come
with me to exper--what?
Is that them?
I don't want to see
my family tonight.
You neverdo.
Have you noticed how,
since we're engaged,
they don't knock
anymore?
They love you.
My family gives me
an unsigned
birthday card.
Kate, come with me.
I'll give you
10 milligrams of valium,
a shot of Stoli,
and we'll be there
before you knowit.
Howcan you not want
to go to Paris?
You're
a history teacher.
Shame on you.
Charlie, the French--
You knowthey hate us.
They smoke.
They have
a whole relationship
to dairy products, which
I don't understand.
Kate, something's wrong
with the cable!
Is the box
set on three?
Aweekin Paris with
the man you love?
Suture demonstrations.
Midnight strolls?
Medicare meetings.
The Eiffel Tower.
The Eiffel Tower...
I'd love to see
the Eiffel Tower.
O.K. then.
Great.
I'm not supposed
to leave the country
Until my immigration
interview.
I'm taking that.
No, no.
No,you're not.
Make something up.
Tell them
yourcousin Bridget
fell in the Seine.
They'll find out
I have
no cousin Bridget
and deport me.
Like the one time
I smoked pot--
I didn't want to,
I had a horrible time,
and Ronny Templeton's
little brother
called the police,
and we got arrested.
The one time I ever
did anything illegal.
<i>Bure drops it in...</i>
They put cheese
on both pizzas.
Herb, this is you--
you didn't check
Take it back
You knowKate
hates cheese.
I'll pickit off.
Here's a list
of stuff I want.
Forget it.
Kate's not going.
- I'm not going.
-Why not?
Is it the
French thing?
No, it's
the flying thing.
It's not the French thing
orthe flying thing.
I'm not supposed to travel
until my Canadian
citizenship clears.
Hon, we got to move it.
Oh, Kate,
I almost forgot--
The Merediths
have put their house
on the market.
Why are we looking at
a house we can't afford?
Charlie, there's something
I have to tellyou.
Since I turned 21,
I've been putting money
aside every week
into a savings account,
which I then rolled into
high-yield term deposits
Wh-what are you
talking about?
I've made us
a nest egg.
Howmany eggs?
45,782 eggs.
Why didn't you
tell me this before?
I wanted it
to be a surprise.
It's a surprise.
It's a big surprise.
So, with a little help
from your parents,
we could probably
afford this.
My whole life is passing
before my eyes,
and we don't even
have children yet.
Hey.
Huh?
Hey.
Come to Paris
with me.
Hi. Right on time.
Saved me from the news.
<i>Bonsoir, chérie.</i>
Hey. Hi,
how's it going?
Good. It's just one
conference afteranother,
But this city--
it's amazing, Kate.
It's so beautiful,
it just casts a spell.
Howwas dinner?
Mmm! They used
this sauce--
It had a taste
I neverexperienced.
<i>C'était incroyable.!</i>
<i>The sauces have
to be incroyables</i>
to cover up
the horse meat.
<i>I sawthis segment on
60 minutes...</i>
You keep watching
all those
you'll neverleave
the house.
Hey!
Hey. I can't talk
I'm with the guys
at this hip club.
I can't hearyou.
Sweetie pie, we need to
talk about the house.
I promise you,
tomorrow.
I got to go, hon.
Love you. bye.
I talked to the broker
and told herwe are ready
to make an offer
as soon as I talk
to Charlie.
You guys are crazy.
I'm never buying
a house
oranything else
worth anything.
Why not?
Because you thinkyou
own something like that,
when, really, it
winds up owning you.
It becomes yourlife,
and then one night,
someone leaves
theircigarette,
and it all burns.
Honey, hello?
Kate? Kate?
Yeah, it's me, Charlie.
Are you all right?
Is something wrong?
No...yeah...
something's happened.
What? Wh-What's wrong?
Oh, Kate...
Kate, I'm just...
I'm just so happy,
you know?
I'm just so happy
and so...
fucked up.
I fucked up,
definitely.
Uh, but it's destiny,
Kate.
That's what it is.
Wha-What are you saying?
What's destiny?
Destiny...oh, Kate.
Well, I met this woman,
this apparition,
this goddesse.
Goddesse?
It's french
for "goddess,"
and so is she.
She's French.
I've never, everfelt
this way before.
I feel I could
do anything.
I could rule the world,
climb the highest
mountain.
I could walkinto
a men's room and pee,
even with some big guy
waiting behind me.
Wha-What?
What are you saying?
Charlie, are you, uh...
Kate, I'm not
coming back
I'm in love...Kate.
Love,
like in a sonnet
orin a movie...
or...like a...
like...love.
I'm sorry, Kate.
I'm so sorry.
Charlie?

# I hate Paris
in the springtime #
# I hate Paris
in the fall #
# I hate Paris #
# In the summer
when it sizzles #
# I hate Paris #
# In the winter
when it drizzles #
# I hate Paris #
# Oh, why, oh, why
do I hate Paris? #
# Because my love
is there #
# With his
slut girlfriend ##
This is my first
time flying.
I'm just kind
of nervous.
First time.
Do you speak
any english?
Didn't yourmother
everteach you
about staring?
What do you think--
the plane will crash
and we are on the ground
in a thousand pieces dead?
I promise you,
ifit happens,
you won't feel a thing.
You're French,
aren't you?
Luc Teyssier.
Howhave you got around
yourwhole life?
Ordo you just stay
in your house
with the doors locked?
I get around
as nature intended--
in a car.
<i>Nous rappelons
nos voyageurs</i>
<i>que l'usage d'appareils
électroniques</i>
<i>est interdit durant
le décollage de l'appareil.</i>
What was that?
What did she say?
That sounded serious.
The pilot says there is
a crackin the engine,
but he take off anyway.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please rememberthat
the use of cellularphones</i>
<i>and other
electronic devices</i>
<i>is forbidden
during takeoff.</i>
I don't know
what they taught
you in France,
but rude
and interesting
are not
the same thing.
Ohh! God!
Oh!
<i>We hope you enjoy
the flight.</i>
O.K., O.K., O.K...
O.K., O.K...
<i>Folks, we're third in line</i>
<i>fortakeoff,</i>
<i>so just relax.</i>
<i>Weshould be in the air
in just a couple of minutes.</i>
I've almost got the
stone cottage going.
Could you please
stop looking at me?
Is incredible.
<i>Wha-- What?</i>
Yourevery muscle
in your body is tense,
even the lids
ofyoureyes.
Your nostrils are--
are closing up.
Howdo you do that?
Me, I love to fly,
especially this moment--
the plane getting ready
to charge the runway,
the engines screaming,
the pressure building,
the force ofit slams you
backin the seat,
and then, whoosh--
you are in the air.
Everything else
is behind you.
There's only one
other place in life
where I feel this kind
of exhilaration.
Oh,yeah?
Where's that?
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.
Just let me guess.
<i>Flight attendants,
prepare fortakeoff.</i>
Oh, God.
I don't think
I can do this.
Did you everthink
that maybe it is
not the airplane?
What's not
the airplane?
That maybe it is
something else
you are afraid of.
What?
Must I say it?
Can I stop you?
It is obvious to me.
I knowyourtype.
What type is that?
You're afraid
to really live.
Oh, God.
You are afraid
oflife.
You are afraid oflove.
You are afraid
of sex.
That is ridiculous.
I can tell from yourface
and howyou dress
with yourlittle
white buttons
all the way up
to here.
In bed,you are waiting
underthe covers,
the light is going off,
and then, like a rabbit...
What?
What is the matter
with you?
You don't knowme.
I knowthat
you are afraid...
You don't know
what I do,
and Charlie
nevercomplained.
Stop that.
There were
a fewmonths
where I didn't
feel like it.
That was
a long time ago,
and I was in between
teaching jobs. Yes.
Foryou to sit there
with that
smug expression
and tell me that
I have a problem
with my life
and my Charlie
is insane.
You're just some
nicotine-saturated--
and, sorry to say,
hygiene-deficient--
Frenchman!
Ah. Look..
what a fantastic
view, huh?
Now, ifyou
will excuse me,
I must go do
as nature intended.
<i>Pardon, monsieur.</i>
Sir, I'm sorry,
there's no smoking on this plane.
OK, then can I have
two glasses with ice?
Excuse me. Can I
askyou something?
I-It's Luke,
isn't it?
Luc.
Luc.
<i>No, not Luc Luc.</i>
<i>Luc?</i>
You want to askme
something, or no?
No. Forget it.
I forget already.
Did you mean all
that stuffyou said,
orwere you just
trying to angerme?
Do I looklike
the kind of person
that doesn't know
howto have a good time?
Uh,you were howold
when you lost it?
It? What it?
You know--it.
Your, uh, flower.
My flower--oh.
My floweris none
ofyour business.
I askyou because
some people,
they rush toward
the fateful moment,
their bodies bursting
to discover.
Others, they guard it
like some precious gift,
and they wait and wait.
You, I suppose,
rushed.
Like a bull.
I have a clear
picture in my mind.
Ayoung bull.
Howyoung?
13.
13?
No,you are right.
I was 12. Magda.
<i>She was putain--</i>
a, uh...prostitute.
She lived just outside
of my town,
just by a little bridge.
She was, uh...
not beautiful,
but she had this mouth.
Oh, there was another
world waiting there.
But I did not have
the money forthe kissing.
Only forthe, uh...
you know.
I don't understand.
To kiss a prostitute,
it costs more.
It has always been.
Oh, well,
that makes sense.
A kiss is so...
so intimate.
You could
probably disconnect
from everything else,
but a kiss...
Two people's lips
together,
and their breath,
a little bit
oftheirsouls...
A-All I mean
is that a kiss
is where the romance is.
<i>Oui that is what
I thought backthen,</i>
so I stole 50 francs
from my brotherAntoine,
and I went back
and I kissed Magda
for half an hour.
It was very good.
Nowyou.
Nowme what?
It is yourturn.
I tellyou,
nowyou tell me.
I am all ears.
All right.
Yeah, uh...
No, I didn't--
I, uh...
I didn't rush--
you were right--
but I didn't hide
from it, either.
I wanted it
to be great.
I was, uh...18.
Jeffthe jock
My basement.
Valentine's day.
<i>yeopardy.!
in the background.</i>
It's a game show
on TV.
<i>Mm-hmm.yeopardy.!
We have it.</i>
Jeff said it
would last longer
with the showon
to distract him.
He got all
the answers wrong
except forsports.
By double jeopardy!,
he was done.
By finaljeopardy!,
he was on his way
home, so...
Yeah, the first time
was bad,
but since then, it's
been mainly good,
and then I found
somebody special,
so it was great.
Could I askyou
something?
Do you believe
in love--
the kind
that lasts forever?
I loved my mother.
No. Everybody
loves theirmother,
Even people who
hate theirmothers.
Is one man meant
forone woman?
That is
the question.
It is not
an interesting question.
It is the question
of a little girl
who believes
in fairy tales.
It's an everyone
question--
one that everybody
thinks
they have
the answerto,
until, one day,
something happens.
Something happened?
Look I understand.
I understand.
One love foryou
would be like
having to eat home
forthe rest
ofyourlife...
and you probably
like to go out
to a different
restaurant
every chance
you get.
Oh!
Careful, now.
What's that?
It is nothing.
Are you hiding
something?
I have to go.
<i>Pardonnez-moi.</i>
I have to go again.
Again?
<i>Parfait.</i>
<i>Tu vas bien?</i>
<i>Voila. Bonsoir.</i>
<i>Ah, bon.</i>
Whew...
Why'd you let me
drink so much?
Me? I did not let you
do anything.
You did it yourself.
And I will give you
a ride into Paris, O.K.?
It will save you a lot
of money, believe me.
Afterwhat we have been
through together...
Where are you staying?
George V.
"Nothing to declare."
That is you.
Me, they're
going to stop.
They always do.
I meet you outside--
one minute maximum.
<i>S'il
vous plait?</i>
Your passport and plane ticket.
Would you open your bag?
Wait forme.
That won't be necessary.
What are you doing here?
Don't you think
a cop gets a vacation?
Give him back his papers.
Look..there's Louise.
I need a taxi to the
George Vin Paris.
I'll callyou Monday.
We'll have a drink
Why wait till Monday?
I've got something...
Nevermind...let's go.
Papa, why are you looking
through the man's things?
The same reason I look
through your room when you're asleep.
To protect my loved ones
from themselves.
You won't find anything in there.
Are you really a thief?
Me?
Daddy says you saved his life.
It's true. You see this little scar?
Luc stopped it
from going all the way over here.
He's no criminal.
That's what I keep telling him.
To the left, Louise.
<i>Oui, madame?</i>
<i>Yes, uh Bonjour.</i>
Uh, do you speak
any English?
Of course.
This is the George V,
not some
backpacker's hovel.
Hovel?
Of course not.
Could you tell me
which room
Charlie Lytton is
staying in, please?
Dr. Charles Lytton.
He's expecting me.
I'm afraid...no.
No?
No, madame.
Perhaps madame could try
the courtesy phone.
Well, madame has tried
the courtesy phone.
Do not disturb.
Ah.
Look Ijust spent
seven hours
on an airplane
crossing an ocean.
I'm tired,
and I'm hungry,
and Ijust want
to see my fiancé.
Now, are you
going to help me?
It is my duty
to vigorously safeguard
the privacy
of our guests,
and if our guests
need safeguarding
from theirown fiancées,
well, afterall,
unlike some countries,
France is not a nation
of puritanical hypocrites.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Ijust gave you
100 francs.
<i>Oui, madame,</i>
<i>and i tookit.
merci.</i>
Ifthere is
anything else I can do,
please let me know.
<i>Bonjour, mademoiselle.</i>
You are American, no?
Forthe moment.
Well, forgive me
forintruding,
but I sawyou
sitting here,
looking a little sad.
Why should such
a beautiful woman
look so sad,
I asked myself.
Have you got
an hour?
As a matteroffact,
always.
Let me help you
to forget yoursadness.
Rememberyou are in Paris,
city oflove.
Can I askyou
something?
Of course.
Can you urinate
with someone standing
right behind you?
I think
I could manage it.
Are you going
to be the someone?
Me? No. That's not
what I meant.
So...
you would like
that I arrange
forsomeone else
to stand next to me?
It could be arranged.
Perhaps Pierre,
Monique...
You have the face
of an angel,
but I'm delighted to find
the mind is a little devil.
Hey, hey,
look mister,
this will get you
nowhere.
I'm waiting to meet
my fiancé.
If he sees you
bothering me,
even talking to me,
he'll walk
right over here--
What are you doing here?
You only workthe metro.
No more.
With this suit, I'm a newman.
Charlie?
Ooh...
Hey,you said you'd
give me a ride.
You said--
where are we?
Your hotel.
I take you
to your room.
I don't have a room.
Someone
has taken my room,
someone in 4-inch heels,
a red dress...
Oh, my God.
My bags.
What?
My bags
are gone.
What? They can't be gone.
Howcan they?
Why look underthere?
I didn't lose my keys.
I lost my suitcase!
Wh-Where did you
put them down?
I fainted right there.
Oh, my money, my passport,
my vitamins...
May I be of service?
<i>Ou sont
ses baggages?</i>
<i>Monsieur,je nesais pas
ce qui s'est passé.</i>
<i>Vous me dites que les
baggages de madame...</i>
You tell him!
Howcould you
let this happen?
What is
your problem?
They're my bags!
Uh, I am upset because
it is my country
and this is a scandal.
Do you remember
anything?
I was sitting here,
then that guy came
and talked to me...
then I sawCharlie.
Oh, here we go again.
Here. Sit, sit, sit.
Breathe in...
breathe out...
breathe in...
I'm breathing!
You know, all men
are bastards.
Well, some are just
trying to help.
I neverthought
I'd say this,
but it's true.
All men
are bastards.
The guy
talking to you,
- He was--
-A bastard.
A Euro-trash-
in-Armani bastard.
He wore a black suit
with a yellowshirt?
Yeah.
-You knowhim?
-Come.
Of course.
Allyou bastards
knoweach other.
Bastard.
All right,
all right.
Uh,you wait here,
I go get the--
my car,
and we go get
yourstuff, O.K.?
<i>Ah, la chienne.</i>
Ah...
So who's this guy
who stole my bags?
Er...bub.
Bub?
No--bub.
Bub, like, uh...
Bub Dylan.
Oh. Bob.
<i>Oui Bahhb.</i>
Now, why are you
helping me?
Why? Er...
because, uh,
I like you.
I do...
but I don't like
howyou say
on the plane
with yourface
all scrunched up,
"you're French,
aren't you?"
I don't like
howyou say
with youreyes
all squinty,
"all men
are bastards."
Scrunched?
<i>Allons-y.!
Allons-y.!</i>
<i>Allez, allez.!</i>
Aah!
Please don't break
the car, O.K.?
O.K., so I try
to understand.
He says he has met
this, uh, woman--
No, no.
This goddess.
Uh, he breaks
your heart.
He, uh...uh, uh--
Hurts me.
Humbles me.
Humiliates you.
Humiliates me.
So you come here
to Paris
so he can do it
again,
but this time,
in yourface.
No.
<i>Pardon.</i>
No, no.
I come to Paris
to get backthe man
that I love.
Is that so hard
to understand,
even forsomeone
like yourself?
O.K., and meanwhile,
his loveris--
don't ever use
that word again.
Uh,
this bastard woman,
she is feeling
something else,
uh, maybe, uh...
<i>once he sawme--
myself-- moi,</i>
everything would change.
The spell would be broken.
Ah.
What,you don't think
I could change his mind?
I would remind him
we had a wonderful,
perfect life together.
Evidently.
I've never been so happy.
When someone
says that,
my ass begins
to twitch.
And we had plans
fora home and family.
I'd remind him
ofthat, too.
He was obviously
very attached to them.
If all else failed--
You'd get down
on your knees and beg?
It's possible.
I can see it--
There is the goddess
standing next to Charlie
in her negligee,
and you are on
your knees, begging.
Poorcharlie.
Tough decision.
<i>Alors.!</i>
I didn't beg.
No. You fainted.
<i>Ah, laisse tomber.</i>
Hey, Luc-a-doo!
<i>Alors,
IA marche?</i>
<i>oui.</i>
I see howfaryou'd go
forthe love ofyourlife.
Ifyou knowso much,
howcome no one greeted
you at the airport?
Please. I'm finished
with women, O.K.?
Haven't found
the right one?
I have found plenty,
believe me.
Oh. Afraid
of commitment.
I'm afraid
of nothing.
I knowyour problem--
no staying power.
What?
You can't
stickit out.
-What?
- It's obvious.
It is?
You are afraid
of commitment.
Commitment!
Oh, O.K., sorry.
I thought
you meant, uh--
What did you think?
Nothing. It's O.K.
<i>Ohh this problem.</i>
It's not a problem!
Foryou, Luc?
Every man
goes through that.
Charlie neverdid,
but,you know,
it's usually an issue
of self-esteem.
It's just a recent
phenomenon, O.K.?
I've been undera lot
of pressure recently.
Soon it will
all be over,
<i>and then zip, boom,
bonjour,</i>
I'm back
in business, O.K.?
Bob, great to see you.
Hi, Luc.
You've met my friend Kate?
Hello again.
Where's the rest?
Hey!
Wh-What about my money
and my passport?
<i>Uh,j'ai forget
passport.</i>
He sold the passport.
First thing to go.
Oh! What about
my suitcase
And my clothes?
Ask him about
my vitamins.
Herclothes?
I gave them to Monique.
Monique?
What? What?
What did he say?
Uh, he threwthem away.
Oh...God!
Oh...man!
Ohh...
God!
Ohh...
What? No.
No, thankyou.
You got rid of everything?
Except forthat...
<i>Ma petite...</i>
<i>Ca va.</i>
<i>Oh...</i>
<i>Papa, il est lá.</i>
<i>Oui, oui, oui.
Ça va. Ça va.</i>
<i>Tout va mieux.</i>
You hid a plant
in my bag?
<i>Not just a plant.
Vine.</i>
That's why
you're helping me.
You don't give
a shit about me.
I'm sorry
you lost yourstuff,
but it was not me
who stole it.
What if I had gotten
stopped at customs?
What would've
happened then?
Don't be ridiculous.
People like you
they don't stop.
Why do you think
I choose you?
You'd declare a pack
of chewing gum.
Please,
don't ever, ever...
Nevertouch my vine.
You don't understand.
This--
This is my future.
I'm going to make
a great vineyard,
and I'm going to escape
this shit hole.
<i>Donnez-moi
break</i>
You can't make
a vineyard
out of one vine.
No. Not one vine.
I take this little
american vine,
I mix it with others,
then I make
something new.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Why listen to you?
It's bullshit.
Everything with you
is bullshit.
O.K., fine.
Go home.
Find a nice little boy
you can boss around.
Only don't let him
out ofyoursight.
Howdo I do that?
I have no money,
no ticket,
no passport...
Here. Take this.
Please.
I don't want
yourmoney.
It's what he got
foryourstuff.
I don't want
yourmoney.
Now go away.
Stop following me.
<i>O.K. au revoir.</i>
<i>Bonne chance.</i>
What necklace?
I didn't see any necklace!
It must still be in her bag!
In her bag?

You are currently
a resident of Canada
in the process of applying
forCanadian citizenship?
My fiancé is Canadian.
Let me askyou
something.
You no longerwant
to be an American,
but you expect me
to give you
a newpassport?
Is this
a trick question?
I'll need a copy
ofyourCanadian
resident visa
before I can process
yourapplication.
Next.
O.K.
Howit works is,
I askyou
a question,
and you comment.
You weren't supposed
to leave Canada, eh?
Yeah, I knowthat,
but an emergency
situation arose,
and I needed to--
what are you
writing down?
Why didn't you
request permission
to leave
foryouremergency?
Well, I should have,
I realize.
But an emergency,
by definition,
doesn't give you
the time.
See, the thing is, sir,
I want to be a Canadian
more than anything.
I want to be
just like you.
Believe me.
Ijust want
to go home.
What's that?
Oh.
O.K.
Have you...
ever been convicted...
of a felony?
No.
Yes.
O.K.
O.K., I was at
Ronny Templeton's house,
and somebody handed me--
All right,
it wasn't a cigarette--
peer pressure.
Peer pressure's
a terrible thing
when you're a girl
in college.
Thing is,
we just received this
from a Sergeant Patton
at the American embassy.
It says you were
once convicted
for possession
of a narcotic.
Is marijuana
really a narcotic?
I mean, it was
just the one time,
and I didn't
even enjoy it.
I inhaled,
but then I was coughing
and hacking away
for 10 minutes.
I hate that.
You do?
Well, the point is
is that you didn't
include this information
in yourapplication for
Canadian citizenship--
Paragraph 5, Article 1?
O.K.
Here's where I tellyou
that your request
fora newresidence visa
has been denied.
<i>Merci.</i>
Yeah. He proposed to her.
He's such an asshole.
Ijust can't believe it.
Do I have to be friends
withJuliette?
Lilly...
Lilly, now, stop it,
all right?
He's not
going to marry her.
Now, tell me
everything you know.
They're going somewhere
in the south of France
to meet her parents,
then they're
getting married.
We're not even invited.
Not that I'd go--
Lilly, now, listen, O.K.?
This is very important.
Very important.
You have to tell me
exactly where they're going
and when, all right?
Now,just--just askmom.
She has it all
written down probably.
O.K.
You still supposed
to call hermom?
Lilly!
O.K.
Mom!
Kate? Is that you,
sweetheart?
I've got all the information
written down,
but I thinkyou can
still get him
at the hotel in Paris.
My God,
she's crying.
It's O.K.
I'm not crying.
I'm just, um...
I'm just, uh...
I'm going to
get him back Mom.
I'm going to
get him back
and I'm going to
make him love me,
and we're going to live
happily everafter.
And I'm just crying
nowin, uh...
happiness...
because I know...
I knowI will, uh...
I will triumph.
What do they call
the beaches?
<i>La cote d'azur.</i>
What does it mean?
The blue coast.
The blue coast,
lying there next to you.
Mmm, and we're going
to land in Nice.
Nice?
Yes.
That's nice.
Sweet.
Ha ha ha ha.
Bob,you knowhowit works.
Ifthe little fish is to survive,
he must tell the fisherman...
...where the big fish are.
Forget it, I'm no rat.
You're mixing yourmetaphors.
Who buys the passports?
<i>Hi there.
C'est moi.</i>
Welcome back madame,
to the George V.
It's incredible
howyou do that.
The words come out
"welcome back"
but the meaning is
completely different.
Is that a French thing
ora concierge thing?
As madame wishes.
You did it again.
Tell me something,
because I--I
just don't get it.
Do you enjoy
being that rude?
Because when
you do that,
it just gets
underneath my skin,
and it makes me
completely insane!
Thankyou, madame, for
the fascinating lesson
in ourcultural
differences.
I'm sure it would not
betray my duty now
to inform you that your
fiancé and his friend
are no longerour guests.
Well, whose guests
would they be now?
The Carlton Hotel will have
that happy privilege
when they arrive
in Cannes tomorrow.
Perhaps madame wishes to
catch the last train tonight.
I could arrange for
a taxi very quickly.
Yes, thankyou.
Bob, I'm losing patience.
A big fish just returned
from the United States.
Luc Teyssier...yourfriend, right?
Ask him about a stolen necklace.
He won't be hard to find.
Take a look
You're welcome.
<i>Allons-y.!</i>
I come to make peace
with your people.
So you're, uh,
still afterCharlie?
It is incredible.
I admire your persistence.
It's so American.
I am not an American.
I'm a soon-to-be
ex-American Canadian.
Uh, may I help you
with your bag?
I am feeling some very
strange emotions forme.
Guilt. Remorse.
My self-esteem
is rock bottom.
What can I do
to say I'm sorry?
Shut up!
You haven't spent
60 seconds with me
when you weren't
aftersomething.
What's it this time--
buy, sell, ortrade?
True,
I used you a lot.
You helped me
to get my vine,
and I left you
with nothing.
What can I do to
make it up to you?
NowI'm here
foryou.
Typical.
Who put this here?
So I asked myself
what I can possibly do
to make it up to you,
so I buy this ticket,
and voila, here I am--
Shh! Quiet.
Oh. You come,you go,
you promise one thing,
you do something else.
Why should I believe you?
Because I have
no reason to lie now.
Do I look
like the kind--
You looklike the kind
who steals airplane
liquor bottles,
who offers a girl a ride,
then has to steal a car
in orderto
give it to her,
the kind who puts a plant
in a person's bag.
This is a no-smoking
compartment.
O.K., I stop. Voila.
Foryou.
See, I'm changing,
I'm growing.
We help each other.
I don't need your help.
Do you have a plan for
when you see Charlie?
Still no?
You're going
into a battle,
you have no strategy,
no armor, no bullshit?
I don't need bullshit
to get Charlie back
Just a little.
It might be handy.
Forme, bullshit
is like breathing.
I stay. I help you.
I promise, O.K.?
Do what you want.
It's a free country.
Isn't it?
<i>Well oui.</i>
Is--Is that Charlie?
Mm-hmm.
Can I, uh...
Howdid you meet?
At a party.
I'd just come to Toronto
on a teaching exchange.
We started talking,
and I had this
feeling about him.
It wasn't exactly
a thunderclap
ora lightning bolt.
It was more like a--
Light drizzle?
You really, honestly,
never had that feeling
about anybody
in yourwhole
entire life?
If I did,
I would not admit it.
His chin looks a little
weak ifyou askme.
It doesn't,
and I didn't.
Why wouldn't you
admit that feeling?
Why? Lookwhere
it's got you.
Maybe ifyou did,
you wouldn't have
that little problem.
It's not a problem.
It's just a temporary--
There's something
in his eyes.
Vain--it is a word, no?
It is a word.
He has beautiful eyes.
And he knows it.
You can see it
in his smile.
Not even a smile.
Asmirk Is a word?
Shut up.
Is it a word?
Two words, no?
Why are you
chasing after him
afterwhat he's done?
Because I love him,
And I'm afraid if he
doesn't come back
that I'll--
it'll hurt so much
that I'll shrivel up
and never be able
to love everagain.
You say that now,
but aftera time,
you would forget.
First,you would
forget his chin,
and then, uh, his nose,
and aftera while,
you would struggle
to rememberthe exact
colorof his eyes.
One day you wake up,
and, pfft, he's gone--
his voice, his smell,
uh, his face...
he will have left you.
And then you
can begin again.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Charlie?
Mmm.
Mmm.
Hey!
I can't seem to get
enough ofthis cheese,
and I haven't eaten
this stuffin years.
You don't looklike
you got much sleep.
<i>Un café.</i>
Forsome reason,
Ijust feel
incredibly refreshed.
I had this dream, which
I can't remember really.
You knowwhen
you have a dream
that is just delicious
and you wake up
and you feel
all transformed?
God, it's beautiful here.
<i>merci.</i>
Did you know
that there are 452
official government cheeses
in this country?
Don't you think
that's incredible,
to come up with 452 ways
of classifying
what is basically
a bacterial process?
You would prefer
one cheese,
one cheeseburger
to put it on,
and one restaurant
to eat it in?
I'm saying
I like the cheese.
God!
What side ofthe train
did you wake up on?
God, it's beautiful here!
What? What's that face?
You don't think
it's beautiful?
You don't think
this is beautiful?
What?
I was born here.
Really?
But this is so beautiful
and so charming.
<i>Ah, oui it was
too beautiful forme.</i>
I had to leave.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
What?
I'm going to die.
What, what,
the cheese?
Don't say it.
Stop that rocking.
Stop the rocking.
I can't.
It is the train.
It's here.
The mucus is here.
The mucus?
The mucus...coating
the intestinal wall.
Spasm!
Spasm!
Uhh!
No, no, no.
Look at the scenery,
the cows--
Oh, please,
not the cows.
Not the cows?
Ijust ate that cow.
There it is.
Here we go.
Lactose...
intolerance!
Jacques Taranne?
<i>Non.</i>
I knowyou...
Phillipe Cazal?
<i>Non.</i>
Michel Desbordes?
Listen, gramps,you don't knowme.
Leave me alone, OK?
You are feeling
better now, huh?
Better.
The cowis all gone?
When's the next train?
Not for
two more hours.
Good.
I think I need to walk
No, no, no.
Bad idea.
Sit. We wait
Forthe train.
Got to walk
But...
Luc Teyssier! That's it!
My stomach
is so sensitive.
That's where
I put all my stress.
Ohh!
Beautiful!
Gorgeous.
Wish you were here.
Wow. Howlong since
you've been back?
Uh, about sixyears.
Sixyears? Is yourfamily
a nightmare orsomething?
I don't really want
to talk about it, O.K.?
A healthy person
is someone
who expresses what
they're feeling inside.
Express, not repress.
You must be one of
the healthiest people
in the world.
You knowwhat
happens to people
who shut
everybody out?
They lead, uh,
quiet, peaceful lives?
No, they fester.
Fester?
I am festering?
Inside.
Festerand rot.
I've seen it happen.
You'll become
one ofthose
hunchbacked,
lonely old men
sitting in the corner
of a crowded cafe
mumbling to yourself.
My ass is twitching.
You people
make my ass twitch.
Excuse me.
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu
fais ici?</i>
Hey!
<i>Attends, attends.</i>
<i>Attends quoi?</i>
<i>Attends.</i>
<i>Attends.!</i>
Uhh!
Wait.
Who is that?
Uh, it's my brother.
Your brother?
My brotherAntoine.
Antoine, this is Kate.
<i>C'est fini.Au revoir.</i>
What's happening?
What's happening?
All ofthis vineyard
is Antoine's.
It has been in ourfamily
forthree generations.
It is who we are,
what we do.
but forAntoine,
I don't know,
he is always sober.
That's a bad thing?
He makes the wine
but neverdrinks it.
You always drinkit.
Now...why isn't
part ofthis yours?
Uh...hmm.
My father, uh,
when he retired,
he left it, uh,
to Antoine and me.
Uh, but now
it is all Antoine's.
I don't get it.
Mmm, to make
a great wine,
you must have
the soul of a gambler.
You like to drink
and you like to gamble.
Sometimes
I would lose a lot.
Sometimes I would
lose to Antoine...
my dog, my first car.
this vineyard.
<i>Uh, oui,
this vineyard, uh...</i>
It was, uh...
one night,
he got me,
uh, very drunk
You must understand,
I owed him a lot of money.
He knew
what he was doing.
What was he doing?
Uh, I lost all ofit,
one hand of poker.
Ha ha ha ha.
You lost your birthright
in one hand of poker?
I'm an asshole.
What can I tellyou?
Uh-huh. So that's
why he hates you
and you hate him.
<i>Ah, oui.</i>
That, and I, uh,
ha, ha,
slept with his wife.
What about your parents
and the rest
ofyourfamily?
Uh, no, there is
nothing between us.
It is all over,
finished.
What ifyou tried again?
No, it's not possible.
They hate me,
they despise me, they--
<i>Eh, luc revient.!</i>
<i>C'est toi, fils.</i>
Papa.
Papa?
Yes, thankyou.
All right, come on.
I'm very impressed.
She's a friend,just a friend.
Since when are women
just yourfriends?
Since I met her.
I'm finished.
Fester, fester,
fester.
Rot, rot, rot.
Pooryou.
You had to
growup here.
Showme your room.
Hmm!
Hmm.
Ha, ha.
What's this?
Uh, it is a project
I did a long time
ago in school.
What is it?
All right, I will
tellyou, but, um...
first you must
take some wine.
Can you, uh,
uh, describe it,
the taste?
It's a nice red wine.
I thinkyou
can do better.
A bold wine with
a hint of sophistication
and lacking in pretension.
Actually, I was just
talking about myself.
I--I don't know.
No, no,
you are not wrong.
Wine is like people.
The vine takes
all the influences
in life
all around it.
It absorbs them,
and it, uh, gets
its, uh, personality.
Here.
Smell.
Rosemary.
Some kind of mushroom?
Very good.
Currant,
cassis, mint,
lavender--
they're all in
the ground here
and in the air.
Now, taste
the wine again.
Close youreyes.
Hmm. The currant--
I can taste that
right away, and, uh,
from the brown bottle,
lavender?
Incredible.
And you made this box?
<i>Ah, oui.</i>
Incredible.
Thanks.
Oh! Whose house
is that?
It's abandoned.
No one comes here
anymore.
The guy who had
this place,
he gave up
a long time ago.
Look
See this, uh, earth?
It's been resting.
Nowit's good.
Someday, I, uh,
I'm going to
buy this land.
I'm going to make
a great wine,
right here on this
wreak of a vineyard.
So you'd risk
everything forthis?
<i>Oui.</i>
Do anything to have it?
<i>Oui.</i>
Get down on
your knees and beg?
<i>Oui.</i>
Then what makes you
so different from me?
Admit it.
Not much.
O.K., I admit.
O.K.
Mmm!
It's beautiful here.
I will help you
get yourCharlie back
Ifyou want him back
we'll get him back
like I promised.
Papa!
Ohh!
Luc!
<i>Oui.</i>
<i>Tu reves.</i>
Tell me something, Luc,
howdo you plan
to buy that vineyard?
You must have a plan,
some strategy.
<i>Oui I had a plan, but
it did not work out.</i>
It didn't work out?
What was the plan?
I, uh, had
something to sell.
Something?
Like what?
Stocks, bonds,
a little bag
of plutonium?
It doesn't matter.
I lost it.
You lost it?
Ifit was me,
I'd have some kind
of backup plan,
something more
than just
bullshit
to fall back on.
Something, perhaps,
maybe a little bit...
like this?
Oh...
Luc,
are you coming?
Lesson numberone--
before going into a war,
you must choose carefully
the field of battle.
Also, neverlet Charlie see
howmuch you desire him.
Nevertell someone
that you want them.
You see that?
What's that,
that pout?
Juliette did that. I
rememberthat perfectly.
The pout is the French
women's greatest weapon.
What's so great
about that?
It's provocative.
It puts the man
in a constant state of
excitement and anxiety.
She can say "yes"
when she means "no"
and vice versa.
Do you understand?
No.
You don't?
Gotcha.
Now, most important,
when Charlie sees you,
he will be expecting
a big scene, a drama.
You will not give him
the satisfaction.
This will make him
immediately intrigued.
Luc, Luc.
What?
Lookwhat I found.
It made me
think ofyou.
Ohh!
M. Antoinne Teyssier.
<i>Oui.</i>
Howwillyou be paying, sir?
When would you like
to have the wedding?
Next weekend.
Next weekend?
Ha ha ha.
Is there something
wrong, Charlie?
No. No, I--
I...swear
Ijust sawKate.
I'm sure it's just
yourimagination.
<i>Il y a quelque chose
qui ne va pas?</i>
<i>Non, tout va bien.
IA va.</i>
Tell me,
what does
yourfatherdo?
Well, he's a doctor...
Like me.
Except he's
a psychiatrist.
I'll be right back
Please, Charlie,
sit down.
<i>Uh, excusez-moi.</i>
<i>Pardon.</i>
Huh?
<i>Mais qu'est-ce que
tu fais, Charlie?</i>
My parents
are watching.
I'm sure
Ijust sawKate.
<i>Mais non.Arrete.</i>
Come with me now.
You really don't
understand me.
Howcan I help you
win back
this ridiculous man
ifyou act
like a clown?
It was an accident,
O.K.?
I wasn't expecting
to see him right then.
Sucking up to her parents...
in that outfit.
Ugh! And did you
see her, huh?
Cutting herfood
into tiny, little
chewable pieces like that.
<i>Oui I sawher.</i>
She was, uh...
She was what?
Well, she was, uh...
Ah. O.K., I know
what you're saying.
I'm not sexy enough.
No, I did not say
anything.
I'm supposed to be
this pouty little girl
who says "yes" for "no"
and "no" for "yes."
I cannot do it, O.K.?
Happy--smile.
Sad--frown.
Use
the corresponding face
forthe corresponding
emotion.
But you?
No,you want
a mysterious,
sexy, manipulative--
it is not me.
I don't want it.
What do you want?
I want you!
I want you...
You want me...
Uh, I want you to...
uh...
make Charlie suffer...
to be tempted.
I want you to make him
feel like
even though you are
right there in front of him,
he can't have you.
That's all.
Luc?
<i>Oui?</i>
Do you, uh...
<i>Oui?</i>
Do you think I still have
a chance with Charlie
afterwhat happened
earlier?
Yes, of course.
And, um, tomorrow,
we will turn yourmistake
to ouradvantage.
We will?
<i>Oui because he will
still be wondering,</i>
did he see you?
You will be
like a ghost, a phantom.
and it will infect them,
their rapport.
Well, when do I
confront him?
Just when they are
starting to look
comfortable again.
Ah.
Then you attack
- Hi.
- Kate!
Hi.
Oh, can I sit
with you guys?
But of course.
Please have a seat.
Uh...
<i>Pardonnez-moi.</i>
Pay no attention to me.
So...
you must beJuliette.
Yes, I'mJuliette.
Let me take a good look
at the woman who stole
my Charlie's heart.
Nothing that did not
want to be stolen.
Ooh...ouch.
She's smart, Charlie.
And beautiful
and probably great
at everything.
Look Kate--
Charlie, Relax.
I didn't come here
fora fight.
Hello, waiter.
<i>-Madame.
- Hi.</i>
I don't speakmuch French.
Asea breeze.
Does that translate?
<i>Sea breeze.
Bien, madame.</i>
French waiters--
ifyou're nice,
they treat you like shit.
Treat them like shit,
they love you.
<i>yuliette, s'il vous plait,
les carottes?</i>
<i>Voila.</i>
<i>Merci.</i>
What?
Nothing. You just
seem so different.
Well, Charlie...
I'm going through some sort
oftransitional thing.
Afteryou called,
I decided to get to Paris
and get you back
I hate to fly. Neverfly,
Right, Charlie?
But I told myself
no way would everything
I've been building toward
be destroyed because
some pouty little--
and this is before
I knewyou personally--
bitch wanted to steal
herself a husband.
So I bought the ticket,
boarded the plane,
somehowmade it
overthe ocean,
and then the most
extraordinary thing happened.
What?
Everything went wrong.
So I was wandering
the streets of Paris--
penniless, without
a hope in the world.
And, let me tellyou,
you can do a lot
of soul-searching
in a time like that.
I realized that I've spent
most of my adult life
trying to protect myself
from exactly this situation.
You can't do it.
There's no home
safe enough,
no relationship
secure enough.
You're just setting yourself up
foran even biggerfall
and having an incredibly
boring time in the process.
Sorry, Charlie.
Oh.
Thankyou.
That's when I
took up with Luc.
Luke?
<i>Luc.</i>
Oh!
There he is.
Luc! Come on over.
I want you to meet
some great people.
Ahh.
Luc, the lovelyJuliette.
<i>Enchantée.</i>
<i>Enchanté.</i>
Charlie, Luc.
<i>Enchanté.</i>
Sweetie pie...
<i>Oui.</i>
<i>Ohh, la la la la la.</i>
<i>Voila.</i>
<i>Maintenant
je comprends tout.</i>
What did he just say?
I don't know.
He doesn't speak
much English,
but we seem to manage
just fine.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
I thinkit's that
transitional thing,
to help me get over us.
That's probably it,
but...what the hell?
I love the sea, so beautiful...
so mysterious...
so...
full offish.
What does he do?
Besides what
we do together?
I don't think he does
anything at all.
Huh.
Oh!
That was so great!
Hi there.
You were
fantastic...
incredible.
They were completely
destroyed.
Oh, that was amazing!
Ijust feel released!
Now, tonight,
you will have dinner
with Charlie,
pretending to, uh...
work out the details
ofthe breakup.
By tomorrow,
I promise you,
you will be queen
ofthe castle again.
We must celebrate.
Some wine,
champagne.
Ah. Don't move.
O.K.
A beautiful day
to be in Cannes...
Isn't it, Kate?
I'm sorry. Do we
knoweach other?
No, but we have
a mutual acquaintance--
Luc Teyssier.
That's why I come
talkto you
about a...necklace.
Oh.
Ha ha ha
ha ha ha!
The necklace.
He was silly, and
he didn't declare it.
Will it be
a large penalty
he'll have to pay?
So why don't you
just arrest him?
I'm old-fashioned.
I owe him a large debt
much biggerthan
the debt of money.
So I askyou
to talkto him.
It can be returned to me
tomorrow...anonymously.
He'll neveragree.
He must.
Call me tomorrow.
It really is
a beautiful day.
I hope you're able
to enjoy it.
This is where I will sell
my necklace tomorrow.
Your necklace.
<i>Oui my necklace.</i>
It was, uh, my
grandmother's necklace.
She lived
in San Francisco.
When she died,
she left it to me.
O.K., sure. Why not?
Luc?
<i>Oui?</i>
What if I sell
the necklace?
You? What
do you mean? Why?
Why? Because I am me,
and you are...
you.
I mean, if I go
into Cartier...
all dressed up,
looking just so,
smiling your
little smile,
walking your
little walk
That would be
better.
Thankyou.
What do you mean,
my little walk?
Oh,just the way
you walk you know?
It's like a woman
and a little girl.
No, it's not.
You want something
to drink?
O.K. great. I'll be out
in a second.
Bought it at the store
downstairs.
You lookwonderful.
Was it expensive?
Yeah.
You charged it
to the room?
<i>Oui.</i>
Good. No problem.
I only wish my brother
could see you.
It only needs
one thing.
You will wearthis
tonight.
I don't thinkthat's
such a good idea.
Oh, no, I insist.
It will be yourcharm...
your good luck charm.
<i># Baisse mon coeur#</i>
<i># D'une longeur#</i>
<i># Mon automne #</i>
Who is the goddess
now?
Now...
we practice.
I will be Charlie.
I'll be Kate.
Ah.
So we are dancing.
I realize howmuch
I need you.
I am thinking,
I am an idiot,
Afool, a chinless,
mindless--
O.K., O.K.
I get the idea.
O.K. so we are dancing.
Mm-hmm.
It feels...
so right.
Now, what do you
say to me?
I don't know
anymore.
You don't?
I don't knowwhen
to stop pretending.
I mean, when do I
tell him that...
that you love
only him...
and still
you want him.
You will know
the moment.
You will tell him,
and that will be that.
You knowwhat I am
going to do foryou
to ensure victory?
What's that?
Juliette.
Juliette?
She will be feeling
a little sad tonight...
a little angry...
a little vulnerable.
I will find her,
and I will...
comfort her.
Well, I wouldn't
want you
to do anything
too unpleasant.
I do it foryou.
Well, what about
yourlittle--
Ah, my little problem
will not be such
a problem tonight.
Suddenly, I'm feeling
Like you--relaxed.
I will, uh,
go to her.
I will find her
and talkto her--
Shh, shh, shh!
<i># Les sanglots longs #</i>
<i># Les violons #</i>
Let's just dance.
<i># De l'automne #</i>
<i># Baisse mon coeur#</i>
<i># D'une longeur#</i>
<i># Mon automne ##</i>
I keep the bonsai.
The lamp we got
in New Yorkis yours.
The living room
love seat...
tell me ifyou
thinkthis is crazy.
Right down the middle
with a chain saw. Bzzz!
Make two chairs.
Can we not
talk about this?
It's depressing,
isn't it?
It's business--
the business
of breaking up.
Ifyou can't
handle it,
I can sell everything and
send you halfthe cash.
You must hate me.
I don't. The cds
will be tough, though.
Why don't you just
let me have them?
You don't hate me?
No. Oh, I did,
Charlie.
I really did, but...
now...
Huh. No.
Kate.
I...
Oh, sweetie,
are you crying?
No.
No, no. I, uh,
I'm...ahem.
You know,
Ijust feel
so totally,
horribly guilty.
Listen, don't feel guilty,
because then I'll start
feeling guilty
that I made you feel
guilty, and...
You know...
actually, that
was the old me.
Just feel guilty.
Swim in it
tillyourfingers
get all pruny.
You're amazing.
You really are.
Hmm.
Kate.
Willyou dance
with me?
Just...
one last dance?
Please?
You're right about his chin.
Sometimes I want to hit it.
He's a waste ofyourtime.
No, he's wonderful...
...so tender.
Not like a French man.
You knowwhat I mean?
Yes, I understand.
Howcould he do this to me?
When I was younger...
...this wouldn't have happened.
He would be with me in my room
and she would wait all night.
I can imagine.
Look at me, please.
Tell me what you see.
Hmm.
You seem
so different...
but the same.
It's like somebody
turned a light on
inside you.
Why wasn't it me?
Mmm!
Unh!
Unh.
Mmm!
Ohh!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Is something wrong?
No, in fact everything is fine.
Wait a second.
Please forgive me.
I must have been
insane.
Mmm!
Luc...
Oh, Kate...
What did you just say?
I said "Kate."
Ohh!
Oh, Kate!
Stop.
Yeah. Oh, darling.
Ow.
Charlie....
Mmm!
Oh! I said...
Stop!
Ow.
What?
Ohhh...
Charlie...
What? What?
Why wasn't it you who
turned on the light...
the big shining
Kate light
that burns
so bright now
that you can't
resist dumping
your new girlfriend
foryourold one?
What?
12 hours ago, allyou
wanted wasJuliette.
Juliette? I...
she's wonderful...
exciting.
And...
When I met her,
I wasn't thinking.
Sometimes you
just do things.
You don't think
about them.
You just need to do them,
do what you're feeling.
Maybe--maybe I was
just--I was afraid,
afraid ofwhere
we were headed.
You know? I was afraid
of getting married.
Charlie?
Hmm?
You weren't afraid of
getting married to her.
You know, no matterwhat
I might seem like tonight,
it's still the same
old me from yesterday
you'd wind up with
tomorrow...
the same old me
who wants the home
and the family,
who wants to plant
some roots
and see them grow.
You want to be
a farmer?
Sorry.
There's just one thing
I don't want anymore.
I'm sorry, Charlie.
Yeah, it's open.
Good morning.
Good morning.
So howdid it go?
What happened?
Well, he wants
to come back
Congratulations.
What about you?
The old bull
backin business?
Oh...
Pfff.
Olé.
We better get going.
Cartieris waiting.
<i>Merci.</i>
Everything
as you said.
The egg?
Nest egg.
<i>Oui.</i>
It was wired from
your bankin Toronto,
and Cartier's agreed
to issue the check
in exchange.
The illusion is complete.
Thankyou.
Why are you
doing this?
You're not with Luc.
You will probably
neversee him again.
I don't know.
I must come
to Canada someday.
You are a very
sympathetic people.
Well, I'm not
really a Canadian.
In fact, I'm...
currently
without country.
Just out of curiosity...
what is it worth?
I would say
over$100,000.
45,782--
what do--do--do--
this is not
possible!
Wha--ohhh!
<i>Pourquoi?</i>
Why did I listen
to you
and yourlittle
walk and--ohhh!
He said there
was a flaw.
Aflaw?
<i>Some flaws.</i>
Some flaws?
Right. He said they're
beautiful diamonds,
but officially,
there are these flaws.
Sorry.
It's O.K.
It's O.K.?
<i>Oui.</i>
It is, um,
not as much
as I was hoping,
but it is enough
to buy the land
and to start
the planting.
It will take longer,
maybe sixyears
before we have
a decent bottle,
but...
thankyou.
Thankyou
very much.
You're my angel
ofluck
Who would have
thought it?
I have to go...
'cause Charlie's waiting.
No, I d--
I love you!
I had dinnerwith her...
Why don't you
go backto her?
You went up to the room
like a freed stri--
Juliette!
Ah love, it's wonderful.
What are you doing here?
Some guy paid his hotel bill
with a stolen credit card.
I've taken care ofit.
That's not true love.
What do you know?
Would you like to hear
a true love story?
I knowa good one.
Really?
Does it have a happy ending?
I don't know.
Maybe you can help with the ending.
Me?
Yes.
Imagine...an airplane.
Kate?
Yes?
You are not afraid
to fly anymore?
You are thinking ofyour
little stone cottage?
It's on a hillside next
to a beautiful vineyard.
But that's not really
what I'm thinking about.
What are you
thinking about?
You.
And I am thinking...
you should not
be flying anywhere.
I shouldn't?
In fact,
I am sure ofit.
You are?
I am thinking...
I want you...
You want me...
That's all.
I want you.
