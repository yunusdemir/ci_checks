Everything okay down there?
Piece of cake.
- That locks it?
- Yep.
Centuries of Thai history...
...safe as Fort Knox.
Watch.
Now, relax, I'm a professional.
Okay, now your servers are
down because of a power surge...
...or a grid malfunction,
or maybe even a bomb.
Now, if an intrudertries to reboot
your servers or access the data...
...he'll always get this screen.
Now, this is your
BIOS level password.
Without it, nothing
works in this room.
Okay.
Oh, you memorized.
Always. Just in case.
- See?
- Good.
All right.
Oh, when do lights come back on?
Oh, right.
You're gonna have to
call an electrician.
Hi.
Yes, Mr. Peterson.
Hi. Yes, my flight's tomorrow.
Global Skies flight 4400,
departing at four.
Would you like me to
arrange a taxi?
Yes, please.
And you have a package, sir.
And welcome back
to the broadcast.
Today in the US Congress,
debate continues to rage...
...over a controversial
security funding bill.
If passed, the measure,
known as Senate Bill 2330...
...will authorize the NSA to upgrade
its current surveillance
technology worldwide.
What kind of special rates do
you have this weekend?
We're offering a
half-price rate, sir.
Really?
Okay, book me for one more night.
And could you please...
Shall I re-book yourflight
with Global Skies?
That's right.
Global Skies flight 4400.
But leaving on Saturday instead.
No problem, Mr. Peterson.
Enjoy your stay.
Thanks a lot.
And in the US Congress today,
controversial Senate Bill 2330
failed by a single vote.
NSA Director Raymond Burke,
an outspoken advocate forthe upgrade
was not available for comment.
And we're getting breaking news
now out of Bangkok, Thailand.
It seems Global Skies
flight 4400 has
crashed in a small town outside
Bangkok shortly aftertakeoff.
All 126 passengers were killed
instantly.
No word yet as to what
might have caused
the crash of Global Skies
flight 4400.
Thank your managerfor
his innovative advertising.
It was a lifesaver.
- Literally.
- Advertising, sir?
The text message?
I'm not familiarwith our
promotional techniques, sir...
...but I'll pass your
compliments along.
No, the senderfield was blank.
Look, I'm looking right at it.
Unknown sender.
What do you mean,
"unknown sender?"
Okay, can you put a trace on it or
something?
Why not?
The biggest news on Wall Street today
was the skyrocketing Syzor...
...which, by market close, had more
than tripled its value at opening bell.
If you own Syzor shares,
you're a happy investortonight.
Checking out.
Did you have a nice
stay with us, sir?
Yes, thanks.
You're all set, sir.
Have a nice flight.
Is something wrong, sir?
I think I need you to
change my flight again.
Sir, do you need a ride?
Taxis sit in traffic to pad meter.
My town car is flat 20 Euros.
Yeah, I don't know...
Sir, how can you
not trust this face?
All right. Where to?
My name is Yuri.
I am from Moscow.
Where are you from?
United States.
Ah, American.
Mm-hm.
What hotel are you staying in?
The Empire.
Good hotel.
Is that a GZT 650?
I'm sorry, what?
Your mobile. Your phone.
GPS capability, UMTS.
Hasn't hit the streets yet.
Where did you get it?
It was a gift.
Good gift.
If you need accessories, earpiece,
charger, let me know.
Driving job just part time.
I can unlock phone, anything you need.
Small fee.
All set, sir?
Yes.
And how will you be paying?
You know what?
Make that a suite.
I've already spoken with DHL.
They said that the package came from
your mail order house.
That's correct.
I'm not denying that, sir.
I know you're not denying that.
I'm just trying to figure out who
paid forthe item that you sent me.
- I'm not allowed to disclose that.
- Why can't you disclose it?
It's strict company policy to protect
our clients' privacy rights, sir.
I'll call you back.
Hey. How you doing?
I was wondering if
I could play this slot.
I'm superstitious about this number.
Sorry, I'm keeping this one
warm for my wife overthere.
I'll give you 20 Euros.
Okay, 40. You can pocket 20 and
you can give the rest to yourwife.
A hundred Euros.
Okay.
Hey!
Sir. Bettertake a look at this.
What do you got?
This guy paid forthat guy's
seat at the slot,
then hit us for 100,000
Euros...
...like he knew the machine
would pay off.
Send up his stats.
Profiling.
Hotel guest Max Peterson.
Arrived today from Bangkok.
American citizen, born in Omaha.
Is he in our books?
He's a ghost.
Nothing in our database or Interpol's.
Well, let's keep an eye on him.
- For you, sir. Well done.
- Thank you.
Cash or chips, sir?
Chips.
Zoom in on him there.
Get you anything?
Ginger ale.
You know, make that
Scotch, neat.
Your bets, please.
Sir.
That's 100,000.
Good luck.
Blackjack.
Play that again.
All right, stop it there.
Zoom in.
Son-of-a-bitch.
It's his phone.
Send in Martin.
Could you hold
onto these for me?
Mobiles are forbidden in casino.
There. Happy?
Yuri.
This is Max Peterson.
You picked me up earlier.
Max with the GZT-650.
Right. I need your help.
I need to be able to read text messages
without looking at my phone.
Why?
Cell phones aren't allowed in the
casino.
You want to cheat.
No! No, no, no.
It's my mother.
She needs to contact me.
Your mother.
Okay, I hook you up.
500 Euros.
500?!
I'll call Radio Shack.
No Radio Shack in Prague.
Only Yuri.
I hook you up.
Bye-bye.
Kamila, where are you going?
Home.
Where do you think I'm going?
Kamila, come back.
Come. Just...
Let go!
Please, just one more drink.
- I said I am leaving.
- Just stay!
I said I'm going home!
Kamila!
She said leave her alone, okay?
- Piss off.
- Just let her go.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Here, let me help you up.
Okay.
I am so sorry.
I didn't know he was like that.
No, it's okay.
He's gone, right?
Yeah, security.
I'm Kamila, by the way.
Max.
Hey, Max. You're American.
- You're a long way from home.
- Yeah.
I'm just here doing a little gambling.
Yeah?
How's that treating you?
Better now.
Okay, can you excuse me just one...?
Hello?
It's Yuri. Meet me in the parking lot.
Yeah, see, now's a bad time...
I've gotta go downstairs
for a minute,
but, maybe I can buy
you a drink later?
I really should be going, so...
Okay.
Thank you again for helping me.
Oh, it was...
Can I see you again?
I'll call you here.
Good night.
All right, where are
they coming from?
According to his service provider...
There's no record of
his text messages.
How is that possible?
Technically, it isn't.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Give me your phone.
All right.
What are you doing?
Bluetooth text to speech transmitter.
Wow!
That's kickass.
Mother, huh?
Bet all.
No sender on SMS.
Very sophisticated.
Who gives gift like this?
I'm not really sure.
You think you could maybe
figure out who sent those?
Not here.
Only back in Moscow.
Really? Why not here?
In Moscow, I have equipment,
connections, can find out anything.
Yeah, but I can't go to Moscow.
You change mind, you have card.
Thanks, Yuri.
You forget something?
Pleasure doing business.
Say hi to mother.
Castle slot.
East wing.
He's back.
All right, where's he headed?
East wing.
East wing?
Maximum bet on next pull.
Oh, shit.
Yes!
Hold it right there!
Don't let that guy leave!
Shit.
Max Peterson?
I'm Special Agent Grant of the FBI.
Put your hands behind your back.
Now!
Grant?
What the fuck are you doing here?
I don't care what this
guy did, all right?
He ripped us off, he stays here.
He comes with us.
I'm not in the Bureau anymore.
You don't give me orders.
I don't have to.
We're taking Sunshine here.
It's good to see
you're still a prick.
Nice tie.
- Tell me about the phone.
- Look, I didn't know.
Whatever it is, I'm really sorry.
Okay, I'll get you started.
You bought it online with a credit card
of one Stuart Wallace.
Then you came here and
you used it to rob a casino.
How am I doing so far?
I swearto God, I don't know what
you're talking about.
This phone came to me in the mail.
Who are you working with,
Mr. Peterson?
Oh, my God, nobody!
I don't know what
you're talking about.
I'll make it easy.
Yuri Malinin.
A known hackerfrom Moscow.
We have a tape of you and him
exchanging equipment.
No, look, I just met him today. He
picked me up from the airport, okay?
Who's sending the messages?
I told you, I don't know, okay?
I got a package and...
You know, no one knows you're here.
Who's sending the messages?
Look, I swear, you gotta believe me,
I don't know.
Who's sending the messages?
Please, I don't know!
Oh, God, just, no, don't!
Bye, Sunshine.
No!
I don't know who sent
the messages, okay?
You know what?
I believe you.
Still resourceful, I see.
This is my town, remember?
Have a seat. Can we get you something?
Cappuccino?
What are you doing here, Dave?
We clean our own house.
This is biggerthan your house, John.
You think I'd fly here and pull the strings
to conduct this operation if it wasn't?
All right.
How about you clue me in?
I'd say you owe me
at least that much.
And I'll take coffee, black,
thank you.
Okay, John.
We've been investigating people
receiving financial tips
via text and SMS.
The recipients have
all been American.
Otherthan that, they seem random.
The first was an executive at Axapris,
a major credit bureau.
The next, a realtor.
They both received tips
to buy stocks.
The stocks went up.
Now, once the person is
hooked on making easy money...
...we think they start receiving
instructions.
Last week we found another
An IT administrator at the
Department of Defense.
She made a million
dollars buying stocks...
...before a co-worker noticed her
receiving unusual text messages.
Then one night she receives
a message...
...and shuts down the firewalls
to the Pentagon's servers.
Who sent the messages?
The senderfields on the texts are
always blank and untraceable.
Can't you interrogate the recipients?
I would.
But they're all dead.
Now you see why your guy
is so important.
You got tipped to the woman.
How did you find Peterson?
We intercepted a similar
text in Bangkok...
...lD-ed him, showed a
sudden ticket to Prague.
I hopped on the next flight.
Doesn't sound like
FBI technology.
I'm coordinating with
Burke at NSA on this.
Oh, Mr. Total Information
Awareness, huh?
Yeah. He's shitting bricks afterthe
DOD incident.
They can trace the texts
if Peterson plays ball.
Can I count on your help?
You have a good nap, Sunshine?
You all right?
Option one,
you can help us nail these bastards.
Option two, you can go
to prison forfraud.
So, what will it be, one ortwo?
Oh, gee, let me think.
Good.
Come on.
I'll give you a ride back to the hotel.
I'll hold onto this till tonight.
You stay confined
to the hotel and act normal.
Normal?
It's Grant for you, sir.
Coffee's cold.
Morning, Grant.
Afternoon, sir.
Right. Now that we've got the small
talk out of the way, what's our status?
We got Peterson.
And?
He doesn't know anything.
Whoever's playing him
is doing it anonymously.
Why him? Any idea?
Not yet, sir.
When can we go live?
We can be ready in
three hours, sir.
Done.
Tracking protocol in three hours,
folks.
Zone 180, trunk-line three negative
lock.
Someday all this will be yours.
Really?
No.
Sir?
John.
I need some answers.
I'm sorry, Mr. Mueller.
I haven't got
anything for you yet.
A man walks into my casino
with nothing more than a phone...
...and walks out with
three million Euros.
If my casinos are vulnerable,
what about my banks?
What about my
commodities operations?
I need to know that some
fool with a phone...
...can't bring down a
multi-billion dollar empire.
I will find whoever's behind this.
Not just who, John. How.
Of course.
Do you like archery, John?
I'm sorry?
Archery.
I was quite an archer
when I was young.
I was passionate about it.
Used to make my own arrows.
Do you know the secret of making an
arrow that will fly to the target?
You need strong feathers.
So, I bought myself a falcon.
Called him Apollo,
afterthe god of archery.
Marvelous creature.
Beautiful, proud.
Magnificent feathers.
So, one day,
Apollo was flying the grounds here.
Flying freely.
I was watching him,
admiring him.
I picked up my bow and shot him.
Straight through the heart.
Died instantly.
Do you know why I did that, John?
To remind myself.
It's the seemingly harmless
traces we leave behind...
...that later can be
used to destroy us.
Feathers, John.
Feathers.
I think I understand.
Follow the messages, John.
Bring me the sender.
Yes, sir.
Yeah?
Hi, it's Kamila.
Wow! Hi.
Where are you?
So, you basically protect
data from hackers?
Yeah. Believe me,
it's not as exciting as it sounds.
Well, don't get me wrong,
it's not a bad job.
I get to travel sometimes.
But why computers?
Well, I don't know.
They're reliable.
They always follow
their programming.
What, as opposed to people?
Well, yeah.
When computers tell you something,
it doesn't really hide what it means.
Oh.
What?
Someone's still hurting
from a bad break-up.
Beautiful and wise.
So, where are you from?
The States.
I bounced around a lot.
And you live in Prague?
Yeah. I study photography
at the university.
So, now you're a photographer?
Not exactly.
Well...
...we all have our secrets,
I guess.
Oh, great.
I gotta go.
Again?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry. Can I buy
you dinner later? Please?
I don't know.
I'll cook.
You cook?
Let's do that.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
We've isolated to trace.
We need three
messages for a lock.
What if I don't get three?
Well, then we wait until we do.
And just keep following their
instructions.
Whateverthey say?
Why do you even care?
It's not your money.
- What about my three million?
- Yourthree million?
I'll look right into that.
Grant?
Yes, sir. We're ready on our end.
Good.
We're live, people.
What a douche.
VIP Blackjack. Seat five.
Here we go.

That was your only warning.
No more interference.
Turn the phone off again,
I'll kill you.
We got them.

North, 38 hours 57 minutes.
Shut it down!
All tracking systems off!
Now!
Abort. I say again, abort.
Yes, sir.
Source is Echelon.
We have an abort.
Pull him off now!
Whoa, what do you mean abort?
Let's go, Peterson.
Hey, don't turn off the phone!
Come on.
This is bullshit. What am I
supposed to tell my boss?
What do I care?
Tell him it's classified.
Classified.
That's not gonna satisfy him.
Well, there goes your job.
Again.
What's going on?
The investigation has
been terminated.
This is about Echelon, isn't it?
You always had a big mouth.
You should keep it shut.
Both of you.
What's Echelon?
It's NSA's central computer.
It filters all global
communication.
Wait a minute. So, whoever's
sending the messages
is using the NSA?
Exactly.
Echelon's been compromised.
Find out what the hell's going on.
I don't show any
unauthorized access, sir.
Somebody got in. I want to know
how they did it and who it was.
Well, I can monitorthe inputs.
If someone's remotely manipulating,
we'll see it in real-time.
Do it.
It's gonna take me some
time to reconfigure the...
Just do it! Now!
Well?
Echelon's a juggernaut.
It can access any security
system on the planet.
I know what Echelon's capable of.
I need to know who
can hack into it.
Well, someone with some
serious knowhow.
My guess is a foreign power,
maybe even an insider.
What are the NSA's plans?
Well, they've gotta keep
a lid on this thing now.
They've got the phone,
so they'll try and trace the
messages without Peterson.
You said there were others
who'd received messages.
Yes, but the selection
seems random.
Nothing's random.
Track Peterson.
He'll lead us to who's doing this.
What makes you think he
hasn't served his purpose already?
Because he isn't dead yet.
Sir, the NSA is not gonna tolerate
an outside investigation.
John, just keep him alive.
Otherwise, you'll have
worse than the NSAto deal with.
Who is he?
Navy SEAL, sir.
He can handle himself.
Not exactly his twin.
He'll do.
If there's a line of sight, which
I doubt, it'll be from a distance.
What about Reed and Peterson?
Do they know?
They'll stay quiet, sir.
Reed I trust. Peterson I don't.
He's too scared to be a threat,
I guarantee it.
We're ready here, sir.
Forgive me for asking, but are you sure
you don't want to use Peterson on this?
Grant, you have your orders,
now follow them.
Waiting forthe order on Peterson, sir.
Proceed.
Well, this was excellent.
You're an amazing cook.
Thank you.
- Let me help you with this.
- No. Stay here. Be right back.
Okay.
You take these
photographs yourself?
Yeah. You like them?
Yeah. Yeah, they're beautiful.
Yeah, it's always been
my dream to live in Paris.
What's stopping you?
Reality.
Isn't that what usually
gets in the way of dreams?
I can't say.
Come on, Max.
You must want something.
I guess...
Thanks.
All I really want is to be useful.
And just once, you know...
...make a real difference.
You'll get your chance.
I've never been.
You're missing out.
Everyone has to
see Paris at least once.
What's so special about it?
It's hard to describe, really.
Tell me.
It's...
...the way the streets look...
...and the light from people's
windows...
...and the rain.
The way it sticks in your eyelashes.
Makes everything a painting.
You know, it's just Paris.
Yeah?
Is he still there?
Yeah.
Good. Keep him there.
I'm on my way.
And, Kamila...
...be prepared for anything.
So, there's a one there,
then the four could be...
Fun my ass.
Anything?
Nothing.
10 am. Kaprova and Kriz...
Krizovnicka.

Morning.
Wow, you look beautiful.
Thank you.
I hope you don't mind.
No, not at all.
What are you reading?
Little background on Echelon.
NSA's filtering computer.
Did you know that the NSA intercepts
every phone call we make?
Every email, every text?
- I guess I just assumed that.
- Yeah, well...
...that's just what exists now.
The upgrade that failed would've put a
camera in every person's home.
Okay, now you just sound paranoid.
No, NSA actually admits it.
Look.
