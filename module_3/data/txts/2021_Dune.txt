A beginning is
a very delicate time.
Know then, that
it is the year 10191.
The Known Universe is
ruled by the
Padisha Emperor Shaddam IV,
my father.
In this time, the most
precious substance
in the Universe
is the spice melange.
The spice extends life.
The spice expands
consciousness.
The spice is vital
to space travel.
The Spacing Guild
and its navigators,
who the spice has
mutated over 4,000 years,
use the orange spice gas,
which gives them
the ability to fold space.
That is,
travel to any part of
the Universe without moving.
Oh, yes.
I forgot to tell you.
The spice exists
on only one planet
in the entire Universe.
A desolate, dry planet
with vast deserts.
Hidden away within the rocks
of these deserts
are a people
known as the Fremen,
who have long held
a prophecy,
that a man would come,
a messiah, who would
lead them to true freedom.
The planet is Arrakis.
Also known as Dune.
<i>A secret report within the Guild.</i>
<i>Four planets have
come to our attention</i>
<i>regarding a plot which could
jeopardize spice production.</i>
<i>Planet Arrakis,
source of the Spice.</i>
<i>Planet Caladan,
home of House Atreides.</i>
<i>Planet Giedi Prime,
home of House Harkonnen.</i>
<i>Planet Kaitain,</i>
<i>home of the Emperor of
the Known Universe.</i>
<i>Send a third-stage
Guild Navigator to Kaitain</i>
<i>to demand details
from the Emperor.</i>
<i>The spice must flow.</i>
Father?
Irulan, you must leave.
A third-stage Guild Navigator
will be here within minutes.
We felt his presence.
I shall want telepathy
during his visit
and a report
when we're finished.
I am your Truthsayer,
my lord.
He's here, my lord.
<i>The Bene Gesserit witch must leave.</i>
Leave us.
Yes, my lord.
We are alone.
<i>We have just
folded space from Ix.</i>
Yes?
How was your journey?
<i>Many machines on Ix.</i>
<i>New machines.</i>
Oh?
Yes.
<i>Better than those
on Richese.</i>
<i>You are transparent.</i>
<i>I see many things.</i>
<i>I see plans within plans.</i>
<i>I see two great houses,</i>
<i>House Atreides,
House Harkonnen feuding.</i>
<i>I see you behind it.</i>
Yes.
<i>You must share with us.</i>
The Atreides House is
building a secret army
using a technique
unknown to us.
A technique
involving sound.
The Duke is becoming
more popular in the Landsraad.
He could threaten me.
I have ordered
House Atreides
to occupy Arrakis
to mine the spice,
thus replacing their enemies,
the Harkonnens.
House Atreides
will not refuse
because of the
tremendous power
they think they will gain.
Then, at an appointed time,
Baron Harkonnen
will return to Arrakis
and launch a sneak attack
on House Atreides.
I have promised the baron
five legions of
my Sardaukar terror troops.
<i>So the Harkonnens will
rid you of House Atreides.</i>
Yes.
<i>One small point.</i>
<i>Here it comes.</i>
<i>We, ourselves, foresee a slight problem</i>
<i>within House Atreides.</i>
<i>Paul. Paul Atreides.</i>
You mean, of course,
Duke Leto Atreides,
his father?
<i>I mean Paul Atreides.</i>
<i>We want him killed.</i>
<i>I did not say this.</i>
<i>I am not here.</i>
I understand.
<i>Why would they want
the Duke's son killed?</i>
We must have
a look at Paul Atreides.
On Caladan.
<i>The powerful Bene Gesserit sisterhood,</i>
<i>for 90 generations,</i>
<i>has been manipulating
bloodlines</i>
<i>to produce
the Kwisatz Haderach.</i>
<i>A super being.</i>
<i>On Caladan, Jessica,</i>
<i>a member of the sisterhood</i>
<i>and the bound concubine of
Duke Leto Atreides</i>
<i>had been ordered to
bear only daughters.</i>
<i>Because of her love
for the Duke,</i>
<i>she disobeyed
and gave birth to a son.</i>
<i>Paul. Paul Atreides.</i>
<i>Here we are now. Caladan.</i>
<i>And 19 light-years beyond.</i>
<i>Beyond Bene Tleilax.</i>
<i>The training planet of the Mentats,</i>
<i>the human computers.</i>
<i>Know a Mentat
by his red-stained lips.</i>
<i>There, Arrakis.</i>
<i>Spice Mining.</i>
<i>Carryalls lower
the harvester to the sand,</i>
<i>and lift it off to safety
when a worm attacks.</i>
<i>Worms attack
all rhythmic vibrations.</i>
<i>Weather. See storms'.
No Precipitation.</i>
<i>Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.</i>
<i>And the Harkonnens are near.
There.</i>
<i>Giedi Prime
and the Baron Harkonnen.</i>
<i>The enemy.</i>
<i>The Baron Harkonnen has sworn
to destroy House Atreides,</i>
<i>and steal the ducal
signet ring for himself.</i>
I know, Thufir, I'm sitting
with my back to the door.
l heard you, Doctor Yueh,
and Gurney
coming down the hall.
Those sounds
could be imitated!
I'd know the difference.
<i>Yes. Perhaps he would at that.</i>
My father sent you
to test me.
Music, then?
No music.
I'm packing this
for the crossing.
Shield practice.
Shield practice?
Gurney, we had
practice this morning.
I'm not in the mood.
Not in the mood?
Mood's a thing for
cattle and love play.
Not fighting!
I'm sorry, Gurney.
Not sorry enough.
<i>What's wrong with Gurney?</i>
<i>He's not faking this.</i>
<i>Now, guard yourself for true!</i>
<i>Is this what you seek?</i>
<i>Good.</i>
<i>The slow blade
penetrates the shield.</i>
<i>But, uh, look down.</i>
<i>We'd have joined
each other in death.</i>
<i>You did seem finally
to get in the mood.</i>
Would you really
have drawn my blood?
If you'd have fought
one whit below your abilities,
I'd have given you
a good scar to remind you.
Things have been
so serious here lately.
Soon we'll leave for Arrakis.
Arrakis is real.
The Harkonnens are real.
Doctor Yueh.
Do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?
I've obtained a filmbook
of a small specimen.
Only 125 meters long.
Only?
There have been documented
sightings of worms
as large as 450 meters
in the deep desert.
That's far from where
we'll be in Arrakeen.
The desert belt
and the south polar region
are marked forbidden.
How do the Fremen
survive there?
We don't know much
about the Fremen.
They live in the deep desert,
some of them in the cities.
They have
blue-within-blue eyes.
The eyes.
Yes.
Saturation of the blood
by the spice melange.
Could the spice
affect us in other ways?
Many dangers
exist on Arrakis.
For one,
the Harkonnens would not have
given up their CHOAM Company
contract so easily.
The Harkonnens are
our enemies, yes.
But behind them,
l suspect, is the Emperor.
You'll make
a formidable duke.
Now, remember,
the first step
in avoiding a trap
is knowing
of its existence.
I know,
but if it is a trap
then why are we going?
We have our new army.
Doctor Yueh,
put the weirding module
on him.
Well.
Clear and lock the room!
<i>Detachment, stand down.</i>
Activate a fighter.
Make the range two meters.
Precise control.
Duncan!
Paul, I was just on my way
to say goodbye to you.
I have to go on ahead,
alone,
l won't be seeing you
for a while.
l wish you were
coming with us. Why?
It's something
for your father.
He wants to talk to you.
I'll see you on Arrakis.
May the hand of God
be with you.
May the hand of God
be with us all, Duncan.
Father.
Thank you
for joining me, Paul.
Thufir Hawat has served
House Atreides
three generations.
He swears you are
the finest student
he has ever taught.
Yueh, Gurney, and Duncan
say the same.
Makes me feel very proud.
I want you
to be proud of me.
I'll miss the sea.
But a person
needs new experiences.
They jar something
deep inside
allowing him to grow.
Without change,
something sleeps
inside us,
and seldom awakens.
The sleeper must awaken.
Arrakis, Dune.
<i>Desert Planet.</i>
<i>I will kill you.</i>
<i>The second moon.</i>
Tell me of your
home world, Usul.
<i>I know she has come to test him.</i>
<i>No man has ever been
tested with the box.</i>
<i>Tonight, l may lose my son.</i>
Jessica, you were told
to bear only daughters
to the Atreides.
Jessica!
It meant so much to him.
You thought only of
a Duke's desire for a son?
Desires don't come
into this.
An Atreides daughter
could have been wed
to a Harkonnen heir
and sealed the breach.
We may lose
both bloodlines now.
l vowed never to
regret my decision.
I'll pay for
all my own mistakes.
And your son
will pay with you.
Arrakis, Dune,
Desert Planet.
Moving.
Moving.
We'll salvage what we can.
But l can tell you,
dear God,
for the father, nothing.
<i>For the father, nothing?</i>
Did you really think you could
bear the Kwisatz Haderach?
The Universe's super being?
How dare you!
My greatest student.
And my greatest
disappointment.
He's awake.
He's listening to us.
Good! Ready yourself,
young Paul Atreides.
I want to see you
in your mother's chambers
in one-quarter
of an hour.
Paul.
This is very important.
<i>Kwisatz Haderach?
The super being?</i>
<i>For the father, nothing?</i>
Vas.
This is the Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam.
She's going
to observe you.
Please.
Jessica,
you know it must be done.
Your Reverence.
<i>What does she fear?</i>
What about my father?
Paul,
listen to the Reverend Mother
and do what she tells you.
Now, you,
come here.
<i>She's using the Voice.</i>
No.
<i>Some strength there.</i>
<i>Surprising.</i>
Come here!
<i>Here.</i>
<i>Come here.</i>
Do you see this?
Put your right hand
in the box.
What's in the box?
Pain.
Stop.
Put your hand in the box.
I hold at your neck
the gom jabbar.
This one kills
only animals.
Are you suggesting
the Duke's son is an animal?
Let us say, I suggest
you may be human.
Your awareness may
be powerful enough
to control your instincts.
Your instinct will be
to remove your hand
from the box.
If you do so,
you die.
You will feel
an itching
there.
Now, the itching
becomes burning.
Heat upon heat upon heat.
It burns.
Silence! Silence!
<i>I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.</i>
<i>Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.</i>
<i>I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass</i>
<i>over me and through me.
I must not fear.</i>
You feel
the flesh crisping.
<i>Fear is the mind killer.</i>
<i>Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.</i>
<i>I will face my fear.</i>
Flesh dropping off.
<i>Fear is the little death.</i>
<i>I must not fear.</i>
<i>Fear is the little death.
I'm...</i>
The pain!
No! Enough!
<i>Kull wahad!</i>
No woman child
ever withstood that much.
Take your hand out of the box
and look at it, young human.
Do it!
Pain by nerve induction.
A human can resist any pain.
Our test is
crisis and observation.
I see the truth of it.
<i>Could he be the one?</i>
<i>Maybe.</i>
<i>But will he be ours
to control?</i>
Tell me of your
home world, Usul.
Do you know of
the Water of Life?
The bile from
the newborn worms
of Arrakis?
I have heard of it.
It is very dangerous.
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood
use it to see within.
There is a place
terrifying to us,
to women.
It is said
a man will come.
The Kwisatz Haderach.
He will go
where we cannot.
Many men have tried.
They tried and failed?
They tried and died.
Jessica.
<i>My son lives!</i>
I sense your
teachings in him.
Ignore the regular order
of training.
His safety
requires the Voice.
I've heard enough
of my safety.
What about my father?
I heard your talking.
You speak as if he were dead.
Well, he's not!
Paul.
Well, he's not.
And he won't die.
Tell me he won't die.
What can be done
has been done.
Mother, tell me!
<i>Mentat Piter De Vries.</i>
<i>Message for
Mentat Piter De Vries.</i>
<i>The Baron is
impatient for Leto's reply.</i>
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,
that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.
<i>It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.</i>
<i>It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,</i>
<i>that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.</i>
<i>It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.</i>
My lord.
Piter!
The Atreides will be
leaving Caladan soon, Baron,
and I have here
your answer from Duke Leto.
What does Leto say, Piter?
He wishes to inform you
that vendetta,
as he puts it,
using the ancient tongue,
the art of kanly,
is still alive.
He does not wish
to meet or speak with you.
I've made my peace gesture.
The forms of kanly
have been obeyed.
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.
As you
instructed me,
I have enlightened
your nephews
concerning my plan...
My plan.
The plan to
crush the Atreides.
Feyd,
Rabban,
go quietly.
No other great house
of the Landsraad
must ever know
of the Emperor's aid
to the Baron.
The entire Landsraad
would turn against the Baron
and the Emperor.
Put the pick in there,
Pete,
and turn it round
real neat.
You are so beautiful,
my Baron.
Your skin, love to me.
Your diseases
lovingly cared for,
for all eternity.
I will have Arrakis back for myself!
He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!
And what Piter
did not tell you
is we have control of
someone who is very close,
very close to Duke Leto.
This person, this traitor
will be worth more to us
than 10 legions of Sardaukar.
And who is this traitor?
I won't tell you
who the traitor is,
or when we'll attack.
However,
the Duke will die before
these eyes and he'll know...
He'll know that it is l,
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!
<i>This is what I'll do to the Duke and his family.</i>
Oh, I'll miss
Caladan so much.
<i>Caladan.</i>
Soon they will
begin to fold space.
<i>Far off in the control rooms of spice gas.</i>
<i>Traveling without moving.</i>
And now,
the prophecy.
One will come.
The voice from
the outer world.
Bringing the Holy War,
the Jihad,
which will
cleanse the Universe,
and bring us out of darkness.
<i>House Atreides took control of Arrakis</i>
<i>63 standard days
into the year 10191 .</i>
<i>It was known that
the Harkonnens,</i>
<i>the former rulers
of Arrakis</i>
<i>would leave many
suicide troops behind.</i>
<i>Atreides' patrols
were doubled.</i>
Duncan!
What have you discovered
about the Fremen, Duncan?
Tell me.
Why haven't
we heard from you?
My lord,
I suspect so much.
I think they are
the allies we seek.
They are strong, fierce.
They do not give their
loyalty easily or quickly.
As you know,
the Imperium has never
been able to take
a census of the Fremen.
Everyone thinks
that there are but few
wandering here and there
in the desert.
My lord,
I suspect an incredible secret
has been kept on this planet.
That the Fremen exist
in vast numbers.
Vast.
And it is they
who control Arrakis.
<i>Each trooper will be charged</i>
<i>with responsibility
for preserving water.</i>
<i>Our existence
as an operating army</i>
<i>depends on these following
water-saving procedures.</i>
<i>Remember, water is life.</i>
Why is the shield
not yet up?
Sir, we found and removed
another sabotage device.
I think it'll go up now, sir.
They're finding these
sabotage devices too easily.
<i>House shields activated.</i>
<i>Duke Leto is now here.</i>
<i>Spice mining inspection
to start immediately.</i>
So you are Doctor Kynes.
The Judge of the Change.
And the imperial
Ecologist, Sire.
Our intelligence informs us
that there's still a strong
Harkonnen presence.
The process of
removal continues.
This is my son, Paul.
Are you a Fremen?
I've been on Arrakis
in the service of the Emperor
long enough
for my eyes to change.
<i>In the service of the Emperor.</i>
We are in your hands, Doctor.
Your gift of the stillsuits
is much appreciated.
Will you give us
an explanation of
their workings?
Well, this is a still suit
of Fremen manufacture,
the most efficient type
on Arrakis.
Basically...
It's all right, Gurney.
Yes, Sire.
Basically,
it's a high-efficiency
filter,
and heat exchange system.
Perspiration passes
through the first layer
and is gathered
in the second.
The salt is separated.
Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action.
The reclaimed water
circulates to catch pockets
from which you can drink
through this tube
around your neck.
Urine and feces are processed
in the thigh pads.
Should you be
in the open desert,
remember to breathe in
through your mouth
and out through
this nose tube.
With a Fremen suit
in good working condition,
life can be sustained
for weeks,
even in the deep desert,
Sire.
My thanks.
With your permission.
You've worn
a stillsuit before.
No.
Your suit is
fitted desert fashion.
Who told you
how to do that?
No one.
It seemed
the proper way.
That it is.
<i>He shall know your ways as if born to them.</i>
We're wasting time, Sire.
That language?
Translate it.
Very faint.
Harkonnen!
<i>Air speed, zero-five.</i>
<i>Ambient temperature,
300 degrees Kelvin.</i>
<i>Air speed, three-zero.</i>
<i>...35% percent
efficiency.</i>
That's where I told
your sandmaster
to concentrate
the harvesting today.
Southeast,
over the Shield Wall.
<i>Ambient temperature, 350 degrees Kelvin.</i>
<i>Air speed, one-three-zero.</i>
<i>Caution. You've now cleared
protective Shield Wall</i>
<i>and entered open desert.</i>
Will we see a worm?
Where there is spice
and spice mining,
there are always worms.
Always?
Always.
Why do they come?
To protect their territory.
Vibrations attract them.
<i>He must be a Fremen or in with them.</i>
<i>He's studying us.</i>
<i>He's hiding something
about the spice.</i>
Is there a relationship
between the worms
and the spice?
As I said, they defend
the spice sands.
As to their relationship
with the spice,
who knows?
<i>My message, it's here.</i>
There are more
enemy bodies coming in
for your inspection,
Doctor Yueh.
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
Thank you, Thufir.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
That's it. Spice mining.
No other cloud
quite like it.
Wormsign?
<i>Is it wormsign?</i>
<i>Yes. Worm. Big one.</i>
You've got sharp eyes.
May l?
Calling Harvester Pad Nine.
Wormsign.
<i>Who calls Pad Nine?</i>
Don't mention the Duke.
This is an un-coded channel.
Unlisted flight
northeast of you.
Wormsign on intercept course.
Estimated contact,
15 minutes.
<i>Have sighting confirmed.
Stand by for a fix.</i>
<i>Contact in 16 minutes minus.</i>
<i>Very precise estimate.</i>
<i>Who's on that
unlisted flight?</i>
What happens now?
The carryall will come
and lift off
the spice harvester.
Try to get in close
over the harvester.
You'll find this
interesting, Sire.
They work until
the very last minute.
Spotter control, there's
no sign of the carryall.
It isn't answering.
The worm is
eight minutes away, Sire.
<i>Spotter control,
give me a report by the numbers.</i>
<i>Report One.</i>
<i>No contact.</i>
<i>Report two.</i>
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>Report Three.</i>
<i>Negative, Sire.</i>
<i>Report four.</i>
<i>No contact.
Repeat, no contact.</i>
I think they've
got our carryall.
Damn it! Harkonnens.
We're coming down to
take you off the harvester.
All spotters are
ordered to comply.
Ordered by whom?
Duke Leto Atreides.
<i>Yes. Yes, Sire.</i>
How many men do you have?
<i>Full crew, 26 men.</i>
But, Sire, we can't
leave all this spice.
Damn the spice!
Get out of there!
Two men in
each of the spotters!
You, over here!
Run! Run!
I can't see him yet,
but he is very close now.
Damn sloppy.
Really damn sloppy.
Come on, boys.
Come on.
We're going to
be heavy, Sire.
<i>Spice.</i>
<i>Pure unrefined spice.</i>
Here he is!
We've got to go!
Bless the Maker
and his water.
Bless the coming
and going of Him.
May His passing
cleanse the world.
What's that
you're saying?
Nothing.
Gods, what a monster.
Someone is going to
pay for this, I promise.
<i>He's more concerned over his men than the spice.</i>
<i>I must admit,
against all better judgment,</i>
<i>I like this Duke.</i>
My lady,
the local people,
the maids and servants,
await your inspection.
Hawat has cleared them.
Excuse me, my lady.
The Harkonnens may have
tampered with them medically.
When you said
Harkonnens,
I didn't know you had
so much reason to hate them.
Well, my wife...
But, of course, you...
You didn't know my wife.
The Har...
Forgive me.
<i>They must have killed her.</i>
Please excuse me
if I can't talk about it.
<i>He's holding something back.
Yet.</i>
<i>There's
the Imperial conditioning.</i>
<i>Assurance of trust.</i>
<i>The Bene Gesserit mother, the legend.</i>
<i>Where is your son?</i>
<i>I must warn you.
You are in great danger.</i>
<i>Safe.</i>
<i>Spice.</i>
<i>What is it doing to me?</i>
<i>Second moon.</i>
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>
<i>Am I the one?</i>
<i>A hunter-seeker!</i>
<i>It can't get me
if I don't move.</i>
<i>It's too dark in here
for it to see clearly.</i>
<i>I've got
to try to grab it.</i>
<i>The suspensor field
will make it
slippery on the bottom.</i>
<i>I must grip it tightly.</i>
<i>Who is operating
that thing?</i>
<i>It has to be someone
in the palace.</i>
<i>I could shout for help,</i>
<i>but it would kill whoever
opened the door.</i>
<i>Hold still.</i>
It would have killed me.
I was its target.
It went to the motion.
Who are you?
I am the Shadout Mapes,
the housekeeper.
I must cleanse
the way between us.
You saved my life,
and we Fremen
pay our debts.
<i>A Fremen.</i>
It is known to us
that you've a traitor
in your midst.
Who it is,
we cannot say.
But we are certain
of it.
A traitor.
Set up a sonar probe
immediately.
Harkonnen.
<i>They've tried to take
the life of my son.</i>
Sector 6 through 80
progress reports, Sire.
Take it, Thufir.
Sector 680, copy the 6th,
the summit, the 8th,
quadrant over,
the 9th plus 84 circles, weave
the 80 and call the 4th. Copy.
8. Thufir Hawat, Mentat,
Master of assassins.
Uh, the palace
is now secure.
The city of Arrakeen
is under martial law.
We have troops here
headquartered underground
on sub-floors
6 through 10.
The rest of the troops
are stationed in Arrakeen,
and we have some
on the airfield.
Our new army is still
in training, but everything,
everything is shielded.
And with this shielding
we are impenetrable.
Sleep well, my son.
Um, Father,
drugged.
<i>Jessica, what is wrong?</i>
<i>Forgive me,
my beloved concubine.</i>
<i>I should have married you.</i>
<i>Why hold a dream
to ascend to the throne</i>
<i>through
a political marriage?</i>
<i>I should have married you.</i>
What happened?
Yueh!
<i>He sabotaged
the house generators.</i>
<i>We are wide open!</i>
<i>House shield deactivating.</i>
I've destroyed the new army's
weirding modules.
I've brought
House Atreides down.
Why?
I wish to kill a man.
Not you, my dear Duke.
You were already dead.
But you'll get close
to the Baron before you die.
You'll be tied and drugged,
but you can still attack.
You can still attack!
When you see the Baron,
you'll have a new
poison gas tooth.
He'll want you close,
so he can gloat over you.
One bite on this tooth
and a strong exhale...
Refuse.
No! You mustn't!
Because, in return,
I'll save the lives
of your Paul and Jessica.
For Paul.
Ahhh!
When you see the Baron,
remember the tooth.
The tooth! The tooth!
The shield is down!
The shield is down!
Open the doors!
Signals!
Get that shield up!
The shield! The shield!
<i>The weirding modules!
Destroyed!</i>
Long live Duke Leto!
The drug was timed.
Dr. Yueh has been
very valuable to us.
What a pity
you must remain gagged.
We can't let
ourselves be swayed
by your witch's voice,
now, can we?
<i>Leto, where are you?</i>
<i>How simple to subdue us.</i>
Goodbye, Jessica.
And goodbye
to your sweet son.
I want to spit
once on your head.
Just some spittle
in your face.
What a luxury!
We were ordered to kill them.
So kill them!
<i>I wish this was Paul.</i>
I knew Yueh's wife.
I was the one who broke
his Imperial conditioning.
I've thought of
many pleasures with you.
It is perhaps
better that you die
in the innards
of a worm.
What are your orders,
Piter?
Take them to the desert,
as the traitor suggested.
The worms will
destroy the evidence.
Their bodies
must never be found.
They're down on this floor
somewhere.
Down there.
Duncan!
Get off!
You wish now
to join your wife?
Is that it, traitor?
She lives?
You wish to join her?
Join her, then.
You think
you've defeated me?
You think I don't know
what I've gained, for my wife!
Take him away.
<i>Yueh's sign.</i>
<i>He's left us stillsuits.</i>
Don't touch my mother!
<i>He's trying the Voice.</i>
<i>The Reverend Mother
said it could save him.</i>
Did you hear a noise
from the little one, huh?
No, I didn't hear
anything.
The little one.
Remove her gag.
Excellent!
There's no need
to fight over me.
<i>A poisoned blade.</i>
First cut my son's bonds.
That's it.
Oh, my God.
<i>It's under control.</i>
Duke Leto Atreides.
Where is
the ducal signet ring?
I must have his ring.
The ring!
He was brought to us
as is, my lord Baron.
You killed the doctor
too soon, you fool!
<i>The doctor, Yueh, what did he say?</i>
<i>Paul and Jessica safe.</i>
Yes. The tooth!
He's coming around, Baron.
Where's your ring?
Huh?
You do not answer?
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>
<i>You must come closer.</i>
The water of my life
for Paul.
He's crying.
He's crying!
What does that mean,
Piter?
<i>Come closer, Baron.</i>
No!
<i>Jessica!</i>
Leto!
Leto, he's dead!
No, he's dead!
I know.
Am I alive?
I'm alive?
Yes,
you're alive,
my Baron.
I'm alive, eh?
I'm alive!
I'm alive!
I'm alive!
I can't maintain any altitude.
We'll never reach
the safety of rock!
Maybe that small rock.
Where are we,
do you think?
The south polar regions.
The forbidden area.
Hold on.
Hurry!
Take the stillsuits!
Hurry!
This crash
might bring a worm.
The signet.
A million deaths
are not enough for Yueh!
<i>Where are my feelings?</i>
<i>I feel for no one.</i>
<i>The second moon.</i>
<i>I mean Paul Atreides.</i>
<i>We want him killed.</i>
<i>Why?</i>
<i>Why do they want me killed?</i>
<i>It has to be something
to do with the spice.</i>
<i>But what?</i>
<i>He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!</i>
<i>This moon holds my future.</i>
<i>Never one drop of rain
on Arrakis.</i>
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>
<i>They will call me,</i>
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>
Listen to me. Listen!
You wanted to know
about my dreams.
Well, I've just had
a waking dream.
Do you know why?
The spice!
It's in everything here.
Calm yourself.
Like the Truthsayer drug.
It's a poison.
You knew the spice
would change me.
But thanks
to your teachings,
it's changing
my consciousness.
I see it!
I can see it!
<i>Is he the one?</i>
You carry my unborn sister
in your womb.
<i>He knows.</i>
Father!
<i>Father, I promise,</i>
<i>one day
the sleeper will awaken.</i>
<i>And I will avenge your death.</i>
<i>I will not stop
until I destroy</i>
<i>the Emperor and the Baron.</i>
Father.
Go now.
Take him
to his desert to die.
Go.
<i>Yueh's left the plan for the weirding modules.</i>
We have to get to
that mountain of rock.
We have entered
the time
when all will turn against us
and seek our lives.
It's further
than I thought.
A worm is sure to come.
I'll plant this thumper.
That should divert it.
Remember,
walk without rhythm,
and we won't
attract a worm.
It will go
to the thumper.
I'm ready.
Faster!
It's deafening!
Ooh!
<i>The spice!</i>
Do you smell it?
Yes!
Paul!
<i>A thumper.</i>
<i>The worm! Spice!</i>
<i>Is there a relationship?</i>
What's happened?
Why did it leave?
Someone started
another thumper.
We're not alone.
Man-carved steps.
Yes.
<i>Such stealth.</i>
<i>I didn't hear them.</i>
Perhaps these are the ones the Shadout Mapes told us of.
I will take the boy-man.
He shall have sanctuary
in my tribe.
Get back!
She has the weirding way.
Great Gods!
If you can do this
to the strongest of us,
you're worth 10 times
your weight of water.
As the leader of my people,
I give you my bond.
Teach us
this weirding way,
and you both
shall have sanctuary.
Your water shall
mingle with our water.
Then I will teach you
our way of battle.
I give you the word bond
of a Bene Gesserit.
It is the legend.
I am Chani,
daughter of Liet.
I would not have permitted you
to harm my tribe.
<i>From my dreams.</i>
<i>So beautiful.</i>
Come with me.
I'll show you
an easier way down.
You have strength.
You shall be known as Usul,
which is the strength
of the base of the pillar.
This is your secret name
in our troop.
But you must choose
the name of manhood,
which we will
call you openly.
What do you call
the mouse shadow
in the second moon?
We call that one Muad'Dib.
Could I be known
as Paul Muad'Dib?
You are Paul Muad'Dib.
And your mother shall be
a Sayyadina among us.
We welcome you.
<i>The dream unfolds.</i>
Moisture!
Wind traps.
Huge ones.
<i>Water.
Millions of decaliters.</i>
A treasure.
Greater than treasure,
Usul.
We have thousands
of such caches,
and only a few of us
know them all.
And when we have enough,
we shall change
the face of Arrakis.
Tell me
of your home world, Usul.
<i>Tell me of your home world, Usul.</i>
Arrakis!
Rabban! Rabban!
We're knee-deep
in Atreides blood!
We've gutted them!
We've gutted them!
Rabban! Rabban!
I place you
in charge of Arrakis.
It's yours to squeeze,
as I promised.
I want you to squeeze
and squeeze and squeeze!
Give me spice!
Drive them!
Drive them
into utter submission!
Do not show
the slightest pity or mercy!
Never stop! Go! Go!
Show no mercy!
Yes, Baron!
Feyd.
And when we've crushed
these people enough,
I'll send you. Feyd.
Lovely Feyd.
Where's my doctor?
<i>Jessica,</i>
<i>our Reverend Mother
is too old.</i>
<i>She has been calling
through space and time,</i>
<i>for you to come
and let her rest.</i>
<i>She asks
that you pass within,</i>
<i>and become
our Reverend Mother.</i>
If you be a Reverend Mother,
let Shai-Hulud judge now!
<i>The Water of Life.</i>
<i>But what
of my unborn child?</i>
<i>One day,
I will have to do this.</i>
<i>Following the Bene Gesserit tradition,</i>
<i>the old Reverend Mother
surrendered her life</i>
<i>as she surrendered
her knowledge.</i>
<i>Jessica had successfully
transmuted the poisonous
Water of Life.</i>
<i>Every man who has tried has died.</i>
<i>Am I the one?</i>
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>
<i>The tremendous power of the Water of Life</i>
<i>caused the premature birth
of Jessica's daughter, Alia.</i>
<i>Alia was born
with all the knowledge</i>
<i>and powers of
a Reverend Mother.</i>
Feyd, even though he's aging,
Thufir is one of the finest
Mentats in the Universe.
And he's mine, Feyd,
all mine.
Try it now.
I will.
Come.
Oh, Thufir!
I see they've installed
your heart plug already.
Don't be angry.
Everyone gets one here.
But this is not
why we're here.
We've brought you
a little cat, Thufir.
You must care for it
if you wish to live.
A poison has been introduced
into your body, Thufir Hawat.
By milking this, this smooth,
little cat body,
you receive your antidote.
It must be done
each day.
All I can see
is an Atreides
that I want to kill.
Feyd, no, no.
Thufir's a Harkonnen now.
Aren't you, Thufir?
<i>My Duke,
how I've failed you.</i>
<i>Chani, I love you.</i>
<i>I've always loved you.</i>
<i>The Holy Warriors.</i>
<i>No one ever dreamed
there were so many.</i>
I am Usul. Paul Muad'Dib.
Our shared enemy,
the Harkonnens,
are once again
in control of Arrakis,
Stilgar, your leader,
has asked me and my mother
to teach you
the weirding way
to crush the Harkonnens.
We must do more than this.
We must totally destroy
all spice production
on Arrakis.
The Guild and the entire
Universe depends on spice.
He who can destroy a thing,
controls a thing.
I will take 100 of your
warriors and train them.
This 100 will train
the thousands that remain.
When the spice flow stops,
all eyes
will turn to Arrakis.
The Baron
and the Emperor himself
will be forced
to deal with us.
Arrakis will become
the center of the Universe.
Orato!
This obelisk is of
your hardest stone.
Kick it.
Hit it.
Yell at it.
Break!
Korba, cut it.
Move back.
This is part
of the weirding way
that we will teach you.
Some thoughts
have a certain sound,
that being
the equivalent to a form.
Through sound and motion,
you will be able to paralyze
nerves, shatter bones,
set fires,
suffocate an enemy,
or burst his organs.
We will kill
until no Harkonnen
breathes Arrakeen air.
Muad'Dib!
Chaaksa.
Stilgar.
Muad'Dib.
Hmm?
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
<i>My name is a killing word.</i>
<i>They are ready to fight.</i>
<i>Yet in order to lead them,</i>
<i>I must conquer the worm,
conquer Shai-Hulud.</i>
Take the kiswa maker hook
of our sietch,
and ride
as a leader of men.
Shai-Hulud.
<i>I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.</i>
<i>Only the very strong ones
travel this deep.</i>
Usul has called a big one!
Again, it is the legend.
Muad'Dib!
Usul, these are 15 of our finest warriors
to serve you
as your guard.
The Fedaykin.
Now.
<i>When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.</i>
<i>The Baron
and the Emperor himself</i>
<i>will be forced
to deal with us.</i>
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib.
What happened?
Muad'Dib.
What happened to you
and your men?
Muad'Dib!
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!
<i>He's been repeating that name
ever since we found him.</i>
Who is this Muad'Dib?
<i>In the two standard years that followed,</i>
<i>Muad'Dib and the Fremen</i>
<i>brought spice production
to a standstill.</i>
<i>Fearing for his life,
Rabban did his best</i>
<i>to hide this fact
from his uncle, the Baron.</i>
<i>Paul's sister Alia matured
at a frightening rate.</i>
<i>Her small body harbored
tremendous powers.</i>
<i>Paul and Chani's love grew.</i>
We surprised
a band of smugglers.
Too bad. I thought
they were Harkonnen.
Gurney!
You've no need of your weapons
with me, Gurney Halleck.
Paul.
Paul!
Don't you trust
your own eyes?
They said you were dead.
They...
They said...
Gurney! Gurney! Gurney!
You young pup!
Gurney!
You young pup!
<i>Emperor Shaddam IV,</i>
<i>you have one last chance</i>
<i>to take matters
into your own hands,</i>
<i>and bring the situation
under control on Arrakis.</i>
What do you mean,
one last...
<i>Silence. Do not speak.</i>
<i>Listen. You do not have more
than this one chance.</i>
<i>I represent the entire Guild
in this matter.</i>
<i>Our navigators warn you</i>
<i>that spice production
is in great danger.</i>
<i>A new Fremen leader,
Muad'Dib,</i>
<i>has stopped spice mining
on Arrakis.</i>
<i>Our navigators suggest
he is not of Arrakis.</i>
<i>No one on the outside world
has been able to see him.</i>
<i>We do not know
who he is.</i>
<i>The Harkonnens
cannot stop him.</i>
<i>Remedy this situation,
restore spice production,</i>
<i>or you'll live out your life
in a pain amplifier.</i>
<i>The Emperor will stop him.</i>
<i>He won't take
the Water of Life.</i>
<i>That's why they want me killed.</i>
<i>They're afraid
I'll take the Water of Life.</i>
I want 50 legions of Sardaukar
on Arrakis at once!
50 legions?
That's our entire
reserves as well.
This is genocide,
the deliberate
and systematic destruction
of all life on Arrakis!
<i>The Emperor is coming!
Chani! Chani!</i>
You were calling my name.
It frightened me.
Oh, Chani.
All the images
of my future are gone.
I have to drink
the Water of Life.
No, Paul, please.
I've seen the men
who have tried.
I've seen how they died.
I'm dead to everyone unless
I try to become what I may be.
Only the Water of Life
will free what can save us.
I must drink
the sacred water.
<i>I must go now.</i>
Hurry. All I see
is darkness.
Paul.
I will love you forever.
You are my life.
You are my life.
<i>Many men have tried.</i>
<i>They tried and failed?</i>
<i>They tried and died.</i>
<i>The worm is the spice.</i>
<i>The spice is the worm.</i>
<i>The worms.</i>
<i>They're not attacking.
Why?</i>
Alia.
Mother.
It's Paul.
He's taken
the Water of Life.
<i>There is a place, terrifying to us,</i>
<i>to women.</i>
<i>This is the place they cannot look.</i>
<i>Traveling without moving.</i>
<i>Now I truly
control the worm</i>
<i>and the spice.</i>
<i>And I have the power
to destroy the spice forever!</i>
Paul.
Paul.
Father!
Father!
The sleeper has awakened!
Muad'Dib.
Arrakis, Dune,
Desert Planet.
Your time has come.
A storm is coming.
Our storm.
And when it arrives,
it will shake the Universe.
Emperor, we come for you!
We come for you!
Long live the fighters!
Long live the fighters!
<i>Suspicion confirmed.</i>
<i>The Emperor's
had Rabban seized.</i>
Gurney, when the storm hits,
set off the atomics.
I want an opening through
the entire shield wall.
Stilgar,
do we have wormsign?
Usul, we have wormsign,
the likes of which
even God has never seen.
Bring in that
floating fat man, the Baron.
Why have you
brought me here?
Your Highness,
there must be some mistake.
I never requested
your presence.
Ah.
But your lack of action
demanded it.
Your dreadful mismanagement,
your bad judgment
in assigning to Rabban
the governorship.
You've forced me
to come here
and set things straight,
personally.
I am a messenger from Muad'Dib.
Poor Emperor.
I'm afraid my brother won't
be very pleased with you.
Silence!
Kill this child.
She's an abomination.
Kill her. Kill her.
Get out of my mind!
Not until
you tell them both
who I really am.
Alia,
daughter of Duke Leto
the Just,
and the royal
Lady Jessica.
Sister
of Paul Muad'Dib.
Paul's sister?
Paul is Muad'Dib?
Alia keeps pace
with the storm.
<i>With the storm,
their air power will be useless.</i>
<i>On Arrakis,
it's desert power.</i>
Gurney.
Now!
Atomics!
My brother is coming
with many Fremen warriors.
Impossible!
Not impossible.
I told you.
He is here now.
<i>Father, today
I will avenge your death.</i>
<i>Emperor, an impassable storm has descended.</i>
<i>Emperor, an impassable storm has descended.</i>
<i>The Shield Wall has been
penetrated by atomics.</i>
Release the Sardaukar.
Baron, give this
little abomination
to the storm.
<i>Wait for my brother, Baron.</i>
Chaa!
Cha.
<i>Wait for my brother.</i>
Cha!
Cha!
Muad'Dib!
Eee-sah!
Eee-sah!
Cha!
<i>Alia, now.</i>
<i>Come to me, Baron.</i>
Muad'Dib!
<i>Feyd Rautha.</i>
Emperor Shaddam IV,
there are Guild Heighliners
above us,
containing many Great Houses
of the Landsraad.
Send them back.
How dare you speak to me in...
<i>Stop your speaking.</i>
You have some idea
of what I could do.
Don't try your powers on me.
Try looking into that place
where you dare not look.
You'll find me there
staring back at you.
You mustn't speak...
Silence!
I remember your gom jabbar.
Now you'll remember mine.
I can kill with a word.
And his word shall carry
death eternal
to those who stand
against the righteous.
The righteous?
There is
a Harkonnen among you.
Give the Harkonnen a blade,
and let him stand forth.
If Feyd wishes,
he can meet you
with my blade in his hand.
I wish it.
This is a Harkonnen animal.
Let me. Please, my lord.
The Emperor's blade.
Why prolong the inevitable?
I will kill you.
I will kill him!
Paul!
I will kill him!
Who is the little one?
A pet, perhaps?
Will she deserve
my special attentions?
<i>Poisoned.</i>
You see your death.
My blade will finish you.
<i>I will bend like
a reed in the wind.</i>
Chaaksa!
Muad'Dib.
Usul no longer needs
the weirding module.
<i>Muad'Dib had become the hand of God,</i>
<i>fulfilling
the Fremen prophecy.</i>
<i>Where there was war,</i>
<i>Muad'Dib would
now bring peace.</i>
<i>Where there was hatred,
Muad'Dib would bring love,</i>
<i>to lead the people
to true freedom,</i>
<i>and to change
the face of Arrakis.</i>
We Fremen have a saying.
God created Arrakis
to train the faithful.
One cannot go
against the word of God.
And how can this be?
For he is
the Kwisatz Haderach.
