Life... upon my life.
Ohh. So beautiful.
I know.
They're coming.
Don't worry. Don't Worry.
I'll take care of you.
Did you understand everything?
It's very important.
All right?
Let's go then.
I'm coming.
We know. We saw them coming.
Now, don't be frightened.
I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
I'm going to hide you...
... in a nice, safe place.
What a shame we did not have more time.
Andre Toulon?
Mr. Toulon.
You can't save her, Alex.
Do you see something, ma'am?
Oh, yes.
I see many great things for you.
Yeah?
You have a wonderful life
ahead of you, young lady.
Do you see marriage, maybe?
Most definitely.
In a very short period of time,
you two are gonna be happily married.
And you are gonna to have...
...a little boy.
No...
Yes, you are...
He's a rambunctious little buddy,
but he's gonna be a good little boy.
And then you're gonna have a little girl.
You know, ma'am, that's really
great. I like that, but, umm...
...do you think Buddy here's ever gonna get...
...a real job?
I see retail sales.
What?
Retail sales?
No, ma'am. I'm sorry.
You better look again, because...
Buddy here, he flunked out of the tenth grade...
... I don't see how he can be in retail sales.
But you see here I see construction.
I see you working as a foreman...
... of a construction company...
... in a retail store.
Kind of like an enormous shopping mall.
You are gonna to be a rich man.
You are gonna to build a shopping mall.
Yes, sir, you are gonna to be a rich man.
Oh, maybe I will marry him, then.
I sit next to a very rich man.
I'm a gold mine.
What else do you see, ma'am?
All I think I see is your grandmother.
She isn't going to be around very long.
My grandmother's already dead, ma'am.
Well, it's...
... it's really your grandmother.
Oh, Buddy.
I'm sorry.
Ma'am?
I think something's wrong with her.
- Ready, Carlissa?
- Yes.
- Ok
Now commencing real-time thought
transmission experiment...
... RT 638.
Passive subject: Andrea Clark.
Active subject: Carlissa Stamford.
All right, Andrea.
I want you to recreate in your mind...
... your wildest sexual fantasy...
... paying particular attention to the details.
All right?
Good.
All right, Carlissa?
Yes.
Begin sequence...
... now.
Are you getting anything about a man...
... on a horse, in the rain?
No.
Now she's running down the beach...
... and she's naked.
He's getting very close to her.
You're not getting any of this?
No.
Why am I getting this...
... and you're not?
This little girl has a very vivid imagination.
- Hello.
- Hi, it's Alex.
Hello, Alex.
We were expecting your call.
You've had contact too, then?
Yes, last night while we were experimenting.
It was very, very strong.
What... what does it mean?
Why all of us at once?
It means Gallagher located...
... the old puppet master's hiding place.
...and he's calling for some kind of a meeting.
We also received a call from the white witch.
Oh, you mean Dana?
Yes...
... the lovely Dana.
She knows the location.
It's an old hotel on the Californian coast...
... called the Bodega Bay Inn.
I want you to come along, Alex.
We'll need all our collected powers.
Dana feels that this is not
going to be a friendly meeting.
Well, I don't know who they think they are.
... just barging in here out of the blue.
They're probably the friends Neil said would come.
They don't look like friends to me.
They look more like trouble.
Shhh. Theresa, don't be rude.
Hello.
I'm Megan Gallagher.
Somebody married Neil?
Hi, I'm Alex Whitaker.
I'm Frank Forrester.
This is Dana Hadley and...
... Carlissa Stamford.
Hello.
I hope this visit wasn't entirely unexpected.
No, no. Neil told me you'd be coming.
And where might old Neil be?
I thought you knew.
Knew what?
He shot himself.
But why?
That's the hard part.
I don't know why.
He left a note...
... but all he said was
he didn't want to be buried...
... until you all arrived.
So now that you're here, we'll bury him tomorrow.
You can stay.
Of course.
No problem.
Well, I'll show you to your rooms,
and then we'll see about some dinner.
Excuse me, Mrs. Gallagher.
Would you mind if...
... we stayed behind a while...
... to pay our respects?
No, not at all.
I think Neil would appreciate that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't touch the body.
Frank, what the hell is
going on around here?
And how is it that we didn't pick up...
... on the fact that he was dead?
I don't know.
Somehow he was able to block the image...
... when he...
... send that signal to us.
What are you doing?
Just making sure he is what he appears to be.
Charming.
Dead as a doornail.
How did you know Neil?
Oh, he and I worked together on a project.
I'm a professor of anthropology
at Yale University.
You're staring at me.
Sorry.
It's just that Neil was...
... so obsessed with his work...
... it's hard to imagine him...
... taking time-out to get married.
These rooms, they haven't been used...
... for quite a while.
You know people used to come here...
...just to see this place from all over?
The Queen of England came here once.
I took care of her myself.
That's an interesting aroma.
What is it?
A Korean dragon's blood.
What are you doing?
I'm cleaning your etheric body.
What?
It's for protecting.
Listen to me.
You are in great danger.
Do not go near the fireplace,
whatever you do.
Why?
Don't go near the fireplace.
I have to go.
I have work to do.
This isn't gonna to be easy.
There's my little darling.
Hello, sweetheart.
I bet you are starving to death.
Got you a ??? dog.
You can't save her, Alex.
Right this way.
Pity about dear Neil.
Were you friendly with him?
Not very.
Sorry to hear that.
What's wrong?
Something happened in this elevator.
Something...
What?
A man forcing a woman to have sex.
What man?
What man?
It was Gallagher.
That woman wasn't his wife.
What is she talking about?
Please, don't interfere.
What is it?
She's experiencing the past.
Tell me.
It was horrible...
... what he did to her...
Oh, god.
Please don't bring up any of this...
... around Mrs. Gallagher.
She's upset enough...
... as it is.
Wouldn't want to have disturbed Mrs. Gallagher.
Don't worry.
Oh my god, Frankie!
What?
This is a movie star bed.
Not now, Carlissa.
No, really.
Two famous movie stars...
... had a wild night in this bed.
Come feel it.
Stop it!
This is business.
We're focusing on Gallagher...
... remember?
You know I can't help it, Frankie.
I know, baby.
It's just that...
... I don't want you becoming distracted.
We have to use your gifts...
... to find out what Gallagher was doing here.
Oh my god!
They did it right in this bed.
Who?
Clark Gable and Carole Lombard.
Clark Gable and...
... Carol Lombard.
Hello.
Did everybody get settled in all right?
Yes, thank you.
This hotel seems to have quite
a history, Mrs. Gallagher.
Yes, it does.
It's been in my family
since the turn of the century.
My parents operated it till they died...
... a few years ago.
Thank you, Theresa.
Miss Megan...
We are just so curious to hear...
... about you and your...
... dear Gallagher.
Well.
I've met Neil when he was staying here...
... working on a project.
We became friends...
... and when my parents died...
... he helped me through some rough times.
Now, that doesn't sound like
the Gallagher we all know.
Anyway, it was something of a surprise to me...
... when he asked me to marry him.
I mean... I liked him a lot.
He said he loved me...
... and he offered to help me run this hotel
Now, that sounds...
... like Gallagher.
He wanted something.
So we got married.
Two years ago next Friday.
He had so many ideas for the hotel.
He wanted to renovate it completely.
So we shut it down.
What about his work?
He didn't really tell me much about it.
I knew it was important to him.
I didn't want him to stop.
Seems like the first year
of our marriage he spent...
... most of his time supervising
construction all over the place.
They really tore it apart.
Then...
One day he just stopped everything...
... and from the next year
he spent almost every day...
... locked up with his work.
I really didn't know what to do.
I would've kicked that bastard out on his ass.
Dana...
If you have something to say...
... I wish you would say it to me.
She likes to stir things up.
Don't let her bother you.
Now, Alex...
The lady has invited me to speak.
I have a wealth of information about her...
...dear beloved Neil that
I would love to share with her
Sit down and shut up.
Well, aren't we the excitable one this evening?
Miss Megan.
There's a question that's
been burning inside of me.
Did it ever...
... pass through your sweet...
... innocent, little mind...
... that your husband possibly...
... married you for your money?
Little bit of sauce and Dana becomes
... quite the cynic, doesn't she?
I'm not a cynic, Frank.
I prefer to think of myself as a...
... nasty bitch.
That's enough, Dana.
Fuck you, you Ivy League tard-ass.
And who's kidding who.
We all know why we're here.
So why continue the pitiful charade...
... of the grave widow?
The truth is, honey...
... your husband was...
... a despicable...
... greedy bastard.
He screwed us...
... now we mean to even the score.
Do I make myself clear?
Perfectly.
You're some piece of work.
Did I say something?
I'm sorry.
I don't know what's wrong with her.
She usually isn't like this.
I'm so confused.
Who are you people?
Well...
Some would call us...
... magicians.
To some degree, we all have
unusual psychic powers.
Your husband brought us together
several years ago...
... to try to help in his research.
He and Frank began to study in the ancient...
... Egyptian methods of the old.
And they found evidence...
... that the Egyptians have
developed a secret method...
... of giving life to inanimate figurines.
Then the secrets were passed on to...
... select few who knew and practiced magic.
Dana there makes a living telling fortunes.
She used her powers to help your husband...
... locate the last true alchemist...
... of the modern times...
... a famous puppet master in the twenties.
And what about Carlissa?
Well, your husband brought her in because of...
... her skills in psychometry.
- Which means?
I mean... she can reconstruct...
... the emotional history of an object...
... by touch or feel.
Like what?
She could sit in a car...
...tell you who owns it...
... sit on a bed and tell you
its entire history.
Oh, I see.
- What about you?
- What do you do?
- I dream.
- Everybody dreams.
Sure, but not about things to come.
It wouldn't kill you to
act like normal people.
I may need a day off.
Somebody there?
What happened?
She feinted.
Look.
Is he alive?
No, he's dead.
Believe me.
He's dead.
Starting tomorrow...
... we're going to tear this place apart.
I think Andre Toulon's secret is right here.
Doesn't make sense.
If he found it...
... why kill himself?
And who's fooling around with the body?
I never did trust this son of a bitch.
What's he up to?
Maybe it's Mrs. Gallagher
who's up to something?
That wasn't a dream I had, was it?
I don't understand.
Who would do that?
Well, we think it was Theresa.
Theresa?
Where is Teresa?
We can't find her.
We looked all over.
Take it easy.
Why did you come here?
I had to.
Why?
I had this dream and I came here...
... to make sure it didn't come true.
Oh my god!
What's wrong?
Two women.
Maybe.
The Second World War.
And?
Details.
They spent their entire leave...
... in this tub.
Listen, darling, as long you're going...
... to be fooling around in there...
... see if you can pick up on Neil Gallagher...
... and that young wife of his, of course.
Shut up.
Sweet dreams...
What are you doing, Frank?
Preparing for tonight's experiment.
Suppose we found it, Frank...
... What Andre Toulon's discovered, I mean...
... What would you do with the power?
If you had it, I mean.
Well, that's easy.
I'd rule the world.
Do you think she's pretty?
Gallagher's wife, I mean.
Frank.
Frank!
Frank!
Frank...
Frank.
Frank...
Yeah?
You scared the heart of me, you jerk.
Come on, darling.
I just wanted to get you into that
haunted house mood for tonight's work.
What're you doing?
We're all in danger.
He means to kill us all.
Who does?
Gallagher.
Honey, even the dead have their ways.
Protection.
Thanks.
December eighth.
1:46 AM.
Researcher and principle psychometric subject...
... are about to embark on sexual
experiment number 517A.
Hopefully, we'll be opening up
a channel to Neil Gallagher.
The experiment will utilize...
... various sexual aids and...
... certain assorted apparatus.
Descriptions to follow.
Sidebar note to transcriber...
... file under personal documentation...
... and be sure to annotate the location.
Are you ready?
Ready and willing.
Promise you'll be gentle.
I love it when you do that.
God, I like this.
No, no.
Not this time.
You don't get to do anything
but what I want you to do.
Oh, great. That's just great.
Yeah...
I think I'm gonna like this.
Perfect.
A little life insurance from the white witch.
Leroy, there's gonna be a lot of changes...
... in the next 24 hours.
... and it's not going to be promising for you-know-who.
This is going to be a long night and lonely night, sugar.
I never did get used to those two.
What are you... what are you doing?
Don't stop.
My god.
What is it?
The door is open.
I think someone's in the room, Frank.
Untie me, Carlissa.
Come on, untie me.
What the hell was that?
Frank!
What?
Carlissa, what are you doing?
God. Don't do this to me, Carlissa.
Shhh. Quiet, Frank..
Carlissa...
It's a joke, right?
Carlissa, where are you?
Carlissa, what's happened?
Carlissa, what're you doing?
Carlissa, you know I have no sense of humour.
You little minx.
You connected with Gallagher, didn't you?
I'm ready for...
What are you going to do to me?
Must be one of those undisclosed
sexual aids, huh, is it?
Good...
Carlissa, stop that!
Carlissa... you're hurting me!
Carlissa, stop it!
Oh, Man...
Come on, wear it out...
Give it a rest...
Please, no...
Hmmm? What's that?
Oh, I'm real happy you decided to come
on a trip with me.
Yes I am.
Well, it would be an awful lonely trip
if you hadn't come along.
What are you doing...
... sneaking around this time of night?
Well, Frank and Carlissa are trying
to rearrange the walls in their room...
...makes it hard to sleep.
I know what you mean.
Would you like to come in for a little nightcap?
Thanks, but I'd rather do a little wandering.
I was hoping we could do a little...
... rearranging of the walls ourselves.
I don't think that would be a good idea, Dana.
No?
No.
I tried.
Goodnight.
Sweet dreams.
It's just me and you, Leroy.
Well, I guess we'll just have
to entertain each other...
... like we always do, Leroy.
I know you don't like Alex very much,
but he's all right.
Now, you just sit down...
... and you stay like a good boy.
Well, look who's here...
... if it isn't my dear old friend, Gallagher.
Come to make a call?
Now, you can fool the others...
... but you don't fool me.
I know what you're about.
We put the dead to rest.
He won't be bothering us anymore, Leroy.
Motherfucker!
Shit...
Alex!
Wake up.
Alex!
Yeah?
Just a second.
Alex...
I want you to come with me.
I have something I want to show you.
Just...
Let me get my shoes.
Hurry.
I couldn't sleep.
Something about Neil's death kept on bothering me.
It never occurred to me before
that there was a connection between...
... the old puppet master's death and my husband...
... but after dinner, it began to make sense.
Neil used to spend hours up here.
I don't know what he was doing exactly, but...
... he never let me come up.
I thought it was strange.
Didn't really mind it.
I came up here earlier...
...and I found something in here.
Would you hold that, please?
I told you I wanna show you something.
You can't save her, Alex.
Stop!
What's happening, Alex?
Alex!
Wake up!
I want you to come with me.
What for?
I have something to show you.
Yeah...
Let me get my shoes.
Hurry.
I couldn't sleep.
Something about Neil's death was really bothering me.
It never occurred to me that
there was a connection between...
... the old puppet master's death and my husband's...
...but after dinner, it started to make sense.
Neil used to spend hours up here.
I don't know what he was doing exactly...
... but he never let me...
... never let you come up.
You thought it was strange, but
you didn't really mind.
How did you know?
Well, I'm kind of a magician, remember?
I came up here earlier tonight...
... and I... I found something in here.
I was looking through Neil's books up here...
... and I started reading this one.
This is Andre Toulon's diary.
Listen to this.
Today, I gave them life...
... using the ancient Egyptian rites of afterlife.
I know that like all my other children,
like my other puppets...
... they mirror the soul of their master.
With me, they are harmless, but...
... I fear what they are capable of...
... if placed in the wrong hands.
Alex.
Alex, what is it? What's wrong?
Alex.
Alex, what is it?
Hello, Alex.
Bye, Alex.
Are you ok?
Alex.
Come on. Let's go.
What is it?
Alex.
They're in the dining-room.
Oh my god.
We have to get out of here.
You're not leaving on my account, are you?
You're dead.
Yes.
I am.
I put a gun in my mouth
and blew away my vast knowledge.
And here I am.
Dead.
Megan doesn't understand the metaphysics of it, Alex.
Will you explain it to her, please?
What's the matter, Alex?
You're not getting slow on me, are you?
Let me explain.
Metaphysically speaking...
... I killed myself...
... and, using the techniques of the old puppet master...
... I brought myself back to life.
Why?
That's easy.
I wanna live forever.
All life eventually ends in death...
... but, for me, there is no end now.
You mean... no natural end.
Alex...
... don't even entertain the thought.
It would take the total destruction of this body...
... something that you're not capable of.
I'm much stronger now...
... than I ever was in life.
Why did you kill them?
Why?
Because we are all joined by our thoughts...
... and sooner or later one of you would have learned...
... that I have discovered Toulon's secrets.
I had to bring you here.
Besides...
I'm tired of experimenting with silly, little...
... wooden puppets.
Actually, I wasn't...
... the first human experiment.
The first experiment was on her parents.
It was a stroke of luck, actually.
I followed the trail of the old puppet master...
... to this hotel.
I was always quick with the women.
Right, Alex?
And Megan, ah...
She was so young.
So east to win over.
No...
Parents...
... that's another story.
I had no choice...
... but to kill them.
It was a small price to pay...
... to live forever.
Bastard!
What the hell are you looking at?
Don't touch the body.
It's time to die, Alex...
Stop it!
... so you can live forever.
Stop!
Stop it!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Open that door you fucking...
... little cretin...
...or I'll chop you into firewood.
You brainless little pinhead.
Get out of my way.
Open this fucking door!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm the master...
... and you're the puppet.
I'll get you, Alex.
Why...
No...
No, no, stop!
No!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Well, my cab's waiting...
You take care of yourself.
Yeah, I will... You too.
If you ever get to the East, give me a call.
You have a good trip.
Good dog, Leroy.
