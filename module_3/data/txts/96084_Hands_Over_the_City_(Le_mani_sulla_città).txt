<i>Yes, the city's</i>
<i>spreading that way</i>
<i>per the urban</i>
<i>development plan.</i>
That's why we have
to bring it over here.
- Just like that?
- Change the urban plan!
- What?
- We change the plan!
No need.
This land is zoned for farming.
What's it cost a square meter?
Maybe 500 or 1,000 lire?
But tomorrow this same land,
this same square meter,
could be worth
70,000 lire or more.
It's all up to us.
A 5,000-percent profit.
There it is.
That's today's gold.
What can beat that?
Business? Industry?
"The industrial renaissance
of the South."
Sure, invest in factories:
strikes, unions, medical benefits.
It'll give you
a heart attack.
I'm proposing
no strife and no worries.
All profit and no risk.
We just convince the city to bring
all improvements out this way.
<i>In which direction</i>
<i>should the city expand?</i>
<i>This issue has long been</i>
<i>the subject of intense debate.</i>
<i>Finally, a special</i>
<i>committee of experts</i>
has chosen the area
north of the city.
Where now there's only
a squalid expanse,
the city will bring
roads, water, power, gas
and all other
necessary improvements.
This is what our party
has fought for so hard:
to get Parliament
to grant a special fund
to develop our city.
With this expansion project,
we and the entire
governing committee
can appear
before our fellow citizens
in the upcoming elections
certain that, once again,
they will not deny us the trust
that has allowed us for years
to garner a majority
on the city council.
And you members of Parliament,
who've always shown
great interest
in the renaissance of the South -
this project concerns you too.
The support we request
from the national government
is not merely
of a financial nature.
It's also a moral matter
of great urgency.
If this support is forthcoming,
we will be true
to our generous southern nature
and give back
on a political plane
in equal measure what we've
received from the government.
Does your flight here
herald a possible alliance
between the right and the center?
- Let's not be hasty.
- That would be a "flight" of fancy.
This is just
what it appears to be.
The minister, anticipating
the release of funds,
wished, on behalf
of the entire government,
to see how the funds
will be employed.
- How many lire?
- 300 billion.
HANDS OVER THE CITY

Give me a hand here!
My son! My baby!
Let me go!
My baby!

Torrese.
Ungaretti.
Zampari.
Mr. Mayor,
we have a quorum.
I hereby open the session.
First item on the agenda.
- May I have the floor?
- On what item?
A building collapsed yesterday in
Vico Sant'Andrea, causing two fatalities,
and a child
is still fighting for his life.
Councilman De Vita,
this item is not on the agenda.
Mr. Mayor, forgive me,
but people can't schedule their deaths
to accommodate our agenda.
You leftists will use anything
at election time.
Since there were casualties,
only the judiciary
has jurisdiction.
An investigation is already underway
to determine responsibility.
What about moral responsibility?
This isn't just a legal matter.
You're wasting our time.
You're the one wasting our time.
Mr. Mayor, I won't tolerate
these constant interruptions.
This isn't on the agenda.
Mr. Mayor, enforce the rules!
Come on!
Speak up against De Vita!
When order is restored,
we can continue.
Silence! Enough!
Let's hear what he has to say.
Silence! Quiet!
This is not an isolated event.
Yesterday's casualties,
and others before them,
are victims of the shameful
private speculation
transforming the face of our city
more and more
as it finds allies among
the very men sitting in this room!
Silence!
What are you driving at?
We want an inquiry board
comprised of every political group
to investigate
real estate speculation -
You know we can't launch
our own investigation
when the judiciary is involved.
We've already established that.
We want an inquiry into real estate
speculation in our city.
The judiciary has
no interest in this topic.
Why doesn't the building
commissioner start
by confirming that
all construction codes were followed?
- I'm willing to clarify -
- You'll clarify nothing!
The topic is closed!
There are more important matters!
Your hands are so dirty you won't
even let your own commissioner speak.
Our hands are clean!
At least allow him to tell us
which company is building
in Vico Sant'Andrea.
Everyone knows
it's the Bellavista Company.
Does the mayor know the majority
shareholder of that company?
If he doesn't -
which he does -
we'll be happy to tell him,
like we told the press.
It's Councilman Edoardo Nottola.
And the construction
manager is his son,
who's been in hiding
since the incident.
Councilman Nottola
is in Rome at the moment.
When he returns,
we'll ask him anything you wish.
However, Councilman Nottola
is also a private citizen,
and there's no law against investing
in a construction company.
He can invest
his money as he pleases.
But he can't speculate
in collusion with the city.
It's you who speculate
on the backs of the people!
You've undermined
the urban development plan.
We reject that insinuation.
We're honest, hardworking people.
It's you who use the people as pawns.
This is election propaganda.
We know your methods
very well.
Silence or I'll clear the room!
You're playing
right into the hands of the left.
This isn't about
an alliance with the left.
We need to reassure
the public.
You're the majority.
Shoot this inquiry down if you wish.
If you've got the guts.
What are they saying?
- They want an inquiry too.
- Even the center?
What's their game?
- It's for their campaign.
We can't lose the people's confidence
right before the elections.
Let's put it to a vote.
Everyone will know
we're the only ones against it,
but I'll grant it precisely
because of elections.
<i>In our city,</i>
<i>councilmen and big businessmen,</i>
<i>commissioners</i>
<i>and real estate speculators</i>
<i>are the same individuals.</i>
<i>Their names</i>
<i>are familiar to everyone.</i>
<i>The most important among them</i>
<i>is Edoardo Nottola.</i>
I can thank my party and the mayor
for my sudden fame.
<i>According to latest estimates,</i>
<i>buildable land has increased</i>
<i>in value since the war</i>
<i>by approximately 120 billion lire.</i>
That's just one aspect
of our city's huge real estate business.
Some of these billions
have ended up
in Edoardo Nottola's pockets.
Counselor,
can I sue for defamation?
We'll see.
"We'll see."
Keep reading.
"To understand Nottola,
we need only remember
that the biggest construction
scandals of the last decade
bear his signature.
Think only of the latest
disaster in Vico Sant'Andrea.
The hard evidence
and results of a city inquiry
point to incompetence
on the part of the Bellavista Company.
But the city has not
stopped construction. Why?"
Because Nottola holds the purse strings.
Shut these people up.
They're not gonna break my balls
before the elections. Go on.
"The inquiry board should have
investigated these matters,
but, predictably, the mayor,
after generously embracing
a proposal by the opposition,
has so restricted the inquiry
as to render it ineffective."
I've told you: no flashes.
I look like Mussolini.
Read that part again.
"...has so restricted the inquiry
as to render it ineffective.
Responsibility on the part
of the city's department of construction
will be determined
only as regards Vico Sant'Andrea."
- Is that it?
- That's it.
Get the mayor on the phone.
Councilman Nottola would like
to speak to the mayor.
The mayor's in a meeting.
Maglione, you seen the papers?
I was right. I'm their only target.
Right, sure!
Listen to me.
I want the four men I designated
from our party on that inquiry board.
To avoid turning this inquiry
into pre-electoral speculation,
please stay within
the limits of our investigation.
For the sake of clarity,
I will repeat
that our purpose
is to investigate
the behavior
of the city's administrative bodies
with respect to contractors
and developers
solely in regard
to Vico Sant'Andrea.
What can we find out like that?
At worst: Someone accepted a bribe.
Let's not start
with the accusations.
We'll just end up
lumping everyone together.
We just want a meaningful inquiry
that doesn't waste our time.
Who's wasting time?
We're here to conduct an inquiry,
not discredit our own administrators.
To prove their honesty,
not their dishonesty.
Honesty! Like we don't know
how things work.
De Vita,
you're whining as usual.
Everything the president said
was absolutely correct.
You're all represented here:
left, center and right.
Isn't that enough?
You'll be doing me a huge favor
if you do discover
these so-called infractions
and these despicable
irregularities.
I intend to moralize.
Relatively speaking,
of course.
Good one.
Taking advantage?
It's inevitable, gentlemen.
Men will be men.
Up to a point, of course.
<i>"Adelante, Pedro, cum judicio."</i>
<i>"Juicio."</i>
I remember <i>"judicio."</i>
It's Spanish.
Now, gentlemen,
City Hall is yours.
What's going on?
Let them through.
Come forward.
De Vita,
see how democracy works?
Excuse me.
How can I find it
with no year or license number?
<i>So many questions!</i>
<i>Higher.</i>
<i>On the left.</i>
<i>Over there.</i>
<i>Right in front of you.</i>
<i>That one.</i>
<i>Give it to me.</i>
Excuse me.
Hello, Picozzi.
Morning, Counselor.
I'm busy.
Tomorrow, tomorrow!
What do I have to do
to get my file?
- The door.
- You close it.
- Here's the file.
- Finally.
Here. It's all in order.
I think we can all be satisfied.
I agree.
We'd like to trace the process from
application to granting of the permit.
Though how they got a permit
in three days is beyond me.
It just means
the system worked efficiently.
As it should.
You're always complaining
about bureaucratic delays.
That's why
our bookkeeper is here.
Morzillo, take these councilmen
wherever they wish to go.
Let's go.
We'll start with technical affairs.
I'll get the files ready.
Always at your service.
De Vita, how long does it
usually take to get a permit?
Six months, if all goes well.
Otherwise, a year or two.
Try as a private citizen.
You'll see.
- The same old story.
- What did you expect?
Morzillo, they're out for blood.
Will you be all right?
I've been here 40 years,
and I've never seen
anyone sacked.
<i>- Where is this department?</i>
- Here they come.
This way.
I had them prepare the file.
Mr. Morzillo
told me all about it.
This is the building
that Bellavista demolished,
and this is the one
that collapsed.
Were they adjacent
or did they share a wall?
We're not all engineers.
Explain your question.
Were the two buildings held up
by one wall or two adjacent walls?
How can we possibly
establish that?
This map is on a scale of 1:2,000.
A one-meter wall is a mm line.
Two walls, 1 mm.
Our pen nibs are 1 mm wide.
So it's technically impossible
to tell one wall from two
given our tools.
Then how can you establish
whether a building can be demolished?
That's not within
my office's jurisdiction.
- Whose jurisdiction is it?
- The Department of Safety's.
<i>Naples is really two cities.</i>
<i>one aboveground and visible,</i>
<i>and the other underground.</i>
In other words,
the ground we build on
is like Swiss cheese,
full of holes.
You have no idea
what's underground:
walkways, caves, crevasses.
Our administration ordered
all these maps,
but they turned out useless,
because earthquakes, floods,
constant infiltrations of water
are forever modifying
structures underground.
So when there's a collapse
due to these wretched
natural causes,
why attribute
the responsibility to humans?
What's all this about?
We're investigating one collapse:
Vico Sant'Andrea.
All this is irrelevant.
- Why?
If one common wall
supports two buildings,
the demolition permit
should not have been granted
without ordering
precautionary measures
necessary to stabilize
the adjacent building -
which was occupied,
let's not forget.
You're saying city engineers
aren't doing their job,
yet you have no proof.
One element has come to light,
and our job is to investigate it.
The foundation for the new building
was laid with a pile driver.
Of course a pile driver would bring
down an old, decrepit building
in an area where the slightest shock
is like an earthquake.
That's plenty for me.
What kind of "element" is that?
It was all according to regulations.
The only thing
that's come to light
is that every department
followed all applicable rules.
In fact, this survey proves
that everything is in order.
On the back are listed
all security measures
prescribed by law. Here.
And did they comply?
We just prescribe them.
- Who verifies compliance?
- No one.
If you don't comply, you go to jail.
That's what the judiciary is for.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Compliance is only verified
after an incident.
Each department did its job.
Let people die.
Let's not get carried away.
The city accords third-party rights
to tenants, owners,
anyone who might sustain damages.
In our case,
tenants made no complaints.
Nor did the owners.
So the city's in the clear.
One guy says
it's not his jurisdiction.
The next says
it's not his concern.
All the fire department
cares about is code.
The perfect machine.
All by the book.
Well, the book needs rewriting!
And you want to do the writing.
No, that book would only be good
in the Soviet Union.
Good one.
De Vita, where are you going?
To grab a bite to eat.
Come to the hospital cafeteria.
We can talk.
All right.
Just let me lock the car.
How are you doing?
Be a good boy
and you go home tomorrow.
Always with the cards, eh?
You done reading the paper?
Look at her.
How are you?
Feeling any better?
Let's see if we can
send you home too.
De Vita,
you asked how I ended up
on the inquiry board.
You see these children?
They need air, light, sanitary housing.
They should never end up here.
Where's Tonino?
- On the terrace.
- Go and get him.
- Go call him, Sister.
Eating candy?
Come on, don't cry.
And there's something
even worse
that weighs on all of us
on the inquiry board:
the young victim
of the collapse.
Here's Tonino.
Come here, young man.
That's it. Keep walking.
Good boy!
They bust your balls
first thing in the morning.
What is it now?
The board goes merrily
about its inquiry,
and my name's in the papers
every single day.
De Vita is chummy with Balsamo,
the councilman from the center.
That should worry you too.
I've got to start
building again.
When building stops,
the money stops.
Is that enough for you?
Calm down.
Have some coffee.
The buildings in Vico Sant'Andrea
must be demolished immediately.
I have to build there,
and you know it.
The first one fell by itself,
thank God.
I've got to do the rest.
Elections are in a month.
We'll all be back on the council,
stronger than ever.
Be patient, Nottola.
We'll handle everything.
Money isn't like a car
that can sit idle in a garage.
It's like a horse
that has to eat every day.
Get to the point.
Those buildings must come down,
but my name mustn't come up.
Just what do you want?
No. It's "What do we want?"
Your interests and mine
are identical.
Don't you see
you're putting me in danger?
It's election time.
There are more important matters.
We have to win.
We can't make foolish mistakes.
Evict those people
and their votes are lost.
I'm running for office too.
I don't want to lose
my votes either.
So what will you do?
The Department of Safety
has to condemn those buildings
and issue eviction notices today.
That way Councilman Nottola
doesn't risk his own votes.
Aren't votes for me
votes for the party?
How's your son doing?
In hiding, waiting for news.
Don't worry.
We'll take care of it.
It better be soon.
He can't hold out long.
He doesn't want to keep hiding.
But what can he do?
Turn himself in?
If we don't do something,
there's no way out.
GIVE US A ROOF
FOR OUR CHILDREN!
STOP TREATING US
LIKE ANIMALS!
WE WANT HOUSING,
NOT HOVELS!
Get out of here!
I don't intend
to force the matter.
I refuse to be responsible
for accidents.
But Commissioner,
these people always behave like this.
If we insist,
they'll get the message.
Very well.
<i>If she accepts</i>
<i>the city's subsidy,</i>
<i>she'll have no right</i>
<i>to say a word later.</i>
She'll never set foot
in her house again!
My children have to eat.
God will provide.
She's right.
No, she's not right.
God will not provide.
If she takes the money,
she can't come back.
- What's a poor woman to do?
- Use her head.
Get out of here!
Good riddance
to these rotten houses,
but we need
somewhere to move to.
- What if the roof collapses?
- Too bad.
We're blacksmiths here.
We're not budging.
These others are blacksmiths,
tailors, cobblers, carpenters.
But their work is here.
They can't leave.
You must leave. The mayor himself
signed the eviction notice.
We'll take our kids to city hall.
Let's see the mayor kick us out.
Quiet up there!
Get out of here!
There's been danger of a collapse
for three years now.
But now it's happened,
and it's more dangerous than ever.
- Naturally.
- Right where they're building.
They're old buildings.
It's all that pounding.
Enough!
We'll decide for you!
That wasn't the deal.
You have to wait for the councilman
and the delegation.
There's no choice.
You must go.
- Where?
- We saw this coming.
Even you couldn't do anything.
You brought this on yourselves.
This is what you get
for voting for them.
You gave them power
to do as they please.
What have they done for you?
Think you'll live in those new buildings?
You'll end up someplace even worse,
where you can't even work.
Commissioner,
the councilman is here.
Who should we vote for then?
The Communists?
Vote for those
who don't profit at your expense!
You can't hold a rally!
Come with me!
I won't allow you to interfere!
Forget your responsibilities.
We want to get to the bottom of things.
I can't allow it!
If you want to talk to me,
calm down.
I have an order
signed by the mayor.
These buildings
could collapse any minute.
I'm an engineer.
These buildings are
like half the buildings in Naples.
Collapse only threatens
when it's convenient for certain people.
How do you know?
Did you conduct the survey?
No, that was the city's technical office,
i.e., Edoardo Nottola.
You need proof
for a statement like that.
Let me show you
some hard facts.
Come with me.
Please.
You want to see or not?
See this?
It's a crapper.
This is running water.
All clean, all state of the art.
Good, stable electrical power.
Here's the kitchen.
The gas.
Follow me.
All this stuff -
you think those buildings
have any of this?
You've seen them.
Why shouldn't we get rid
of all those buildings
and replace them with these?
And another thing, De Vita.
Why are you on my back?
To further your own cause?
So they understand
just who you are.
I'm a man who invests
his time, money and labor
to get rid
of these stinking hovels.
That's a lie.
The facts say otherwise.
You're an outlaw.
The law creates an urban plan,
and you ignore it.
You take away people's
homes and jobs
and don't give a damn
where they end up.
They certainly
don't end up living here.
I don't run a charity.
Who asked you to?
But you know no bounds.
Two men died and a boy lost his legs,
and you don't care!
All that matters
is stuffing your pockets.
It's your methods I'm against,
not the buildings.
I want them built in accordance
with the law, not your schemes!

We'll let the president decide.
Please go on
with your presentation.
In the urban
development plan of 1939
and that of 1958,
yet to be approved,
the area in which
the Bellavista Company is building
is zoned for public use.
- That's enough for us.
- Please.
In the resolution
you're now examining,
the city authorized sale
of that land to Bellavista.
As was its right.
So as far as my office is concerned,
everything is in order.
That's sufficient.
Thank you for these clarifications.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
These clarifications
from the city's chief engineer
rule out,
as was predictable,
any irregularity in the operation
of our administrative departments.
I therefore deplore
Councilman De Vita's actions.
With his indiscretion
and the uproar
he caused in the press,
he has denigrated and vilified
the work and the very prestige
of this board.
Hear, hear.
The press learned of things
it should not have
until after the official results
of this inquiry.
This whole case
was one big setup
with nothing to uncover.
De Vita's actions were
undemocratic and inappropriate.
The inappropriateness of a decision
affecting the entire city,
such as the sale of public land
to a private citizen
without prior debate
in the city council,
is a moral issue.
I can't expect you
to grasp such reasoning.
So let's stick to the facts.
What did
the inquiry board ascertain?
That land
zoned for public use
was sold by resolution
of the governing committee
to a private company
owned by a sitting councilman.
Do we agree on these facts?
Let's put them on the record.
Do you think
we're all children?
Our task is to determine
whether municipal departments
committed irregularities,
not pass judgment
on the governing committee.
We've ascertained
that the city acted appropriately.
That's what should go
on the record.
Are you so bent on saving
this Nottola character?
Are you starting now too?
Let's wrap up the inquiry.
We'll talk about this elsewhere.
We must respect the law.
And stay within the limits
of this particular inquiry.
You're not respecting
the law this way.
In fact, you're using
your majority power to defy the law.
Two very grave facts
have emerged:
First, public land
was sold to a private citizen.
What might have been built there?
A park, a school, a hospital?
Secondly, the council at large
was never informed,
which is inadmissible
when public interests are at stake.
Only the opposition can act
as a check
on the majority's power,
and that's the only
guarantee of democracy.
You hear that?
It's not just the left talking.
When there's no political will
to investigate,
an inquiry serves no purpose.
We'll proceed by other means.
There's the parliament,
the press, public opinion.
You're trying
to bury the whole affair.
You want to minimize
the entire incident.
We reject your methods.
Nottola, we made a mistake.
Now we must avoid
making things worse.
There's just one way out.
And this is the party
speaking through me.
We must prove to the public
that we can take
responsibility for our actions.
Unfortunately,
this time it falls to you.
If the inquiry
establishes collusion,
you knew nothing about it.
It involved your company
and a few city officials.
We cover up the whole thing,
and the administration survives.
This scandal threatens
the governing committee,
all of us, the party,
the entire project.
It's election time.
Don't forget that.
Take my advice.
You won't regret it.
Just what are you saying?
What are you getting at?
Let's hear it.
Your company gets
a slap on the wrist,
a few city officials
take early retirement,
and everything
returns to normal.
You know
how these things are resolved.
Let's lay our cards
on the table.
You're telling me
to withdraw my candidacy.
Are you all crazy?
My votes cost me millions.
I got them one by one, door to door.
And when you needed them,
you took them.
Now I should hand them over
to the first idiot
you put in my place?
Sure, when you need Nottola, great.
Otherwise...
it's God bless and good-bye.
But he's still a good investment
as a private citizen,
because the money rolls in...
with no questions asked.
What about that?
Do we sacrifice it
to your political ambitions?
Listen.
When you diwy things up,
you expect me to come begging.
"May I build this high-rise?
May I have this contract?"
I must be building commissioner.
I'm the only one I can trust.
But why?
To get the contracts for the project?
You've already got them!
We've got to win the elections,
get a clear majority.
With all your shenanigans,
we can forget it.
Stick to building!
You're no politician!
We're all hanging by a thread.
I have to be commissioner.
If we lose votes
because of you,
you'll never put two bricks
together again.
Take my word for it.
Eat your spaghetti first.
Then we'll discuss the situation.
This isn't about you personally.
People say the party
hasn't kept its word.
But what's the man
in the street saying?
The people who voted for me -
what are they thinking?
They don't listen to us like before.
The people will do
exactly as we tell them.
You don't know.
You spend all day
in the boss's office.
We actually go in their houses.
We know what they think.
Boss, people are unhappy
and disappointed.
They just want more money.
Watch your mouth.
People want security.
They want factory jobs.
Those who go up north
come back and tell the others.
Workers in Milan and Turin
are living large.
They have skills!
What can these people here do?
They have no skills,
but they need to live too.
And they're tired of empty words.
They want hard facts.
What more do they want
from me?
I've fed entire families,
handed out jobs left and right.
What more do they want?
I pay for medicines, hospital bills.
What do they want?
Boss, those things
come and go.
People want substance.
You still have your following.
It's the party that's falling apart.
These days,
ideas get around fast.
Even the government's
getting the picture.
You watch television,
and so do the people.
It'll be easy to convince them.
Promise a future
for them and their children,
and you'll have
all the votes you want.
- How much is the bank?
- Three and a half million.
- Place your bets.
- 100,000.
No more bets.
No more.
These don't count.
Who wants to see them?
Who wants first card?
Quiet, please!
Eight for the house.
He's got magic fingers tonight.
I'm playing alone.
I told you that.
Half a million.
Enough!
He's playing alone.
Please, don't insist.
Enough!
I said no!
Please, the stakes are high.
He's killing me, damn it.
Dealing the second player.
Nine for the house.
I'll write you a check later.
You can give him the difference,
all right?
Get rid of that damn dog!
It's a jinx!
What's the poor thing
ever done to you?
Go outside.
Just because you're losing,
you blame him.
Dani', where are you going?
- Now what?
- Did a snake bite you or what?
Renato.
Is Marcello here?
- He's inside, losing his shirt.
- Maglione?
- He's there too.
- Thanks.
- Anytime.
<i>- Evening, sir. How are you?</i>
- Fine.
- Whiskey?
- Yes. Have them call Mr. Marcello.
Gennari', come here.
Go tell Mr. Marcello
to come to the bar.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
- What brings you here?
- Come with me.
I'm playing.
I can't just walk out.
- I'll explain later.
- Okay. Get me my coat.
It's late.
Can't we go tomorrow?
We have to go now.
They'll all be asleep.
Are you afraid they'll say,
"We don't need you?"
lmpossible. They've approached me
several times.
They know you'll follow me
and that they need our votes
to win the majority.
It's our names that count.
Don't you see?
Not the party flag we wave.
I know, I know. You're afraid
Maglione will call us traitors.
But for how long?
His interests are the same as ours.
And when I become commissioner,
he'll have to beg like all the others.
In politics, friendship
is a matter of convenience.
What if you don't become commissioner,
if we don't gain the majority?
Then I walk
and take my votes with me.
Maglione even said
the majority hangs by a thread.
Well, we break that thread.
It's just a matter of time:
today, tomorrow.
They're the bosses.
If you want to stay afloat, you join them.
Close the blinds.
Is the counselor in?
Wake him up.
This is Nottola.
Listen carefully.
Go tell my son to turn himself in.
That's right. No questions.
You'll know soon enough.
Tell him it's the only way.
It has to be on every front page.
"Developer Edoardo Nottola
convinces his son
to turn himself in for the accident
in Vico Sant'Andrea."
Yes, I'm here.
What more is it gonna take?
Pay the victims' families -
10, 20, 30 million!
But do it now!
I've had enough!
You appreciate art, I see.
How are you, Balsamo?
Forgive me.
You were still eating.
Don't mention it.
Were you admiring
the Luca Giordano?
You think painters today
are capable of such intensity?
Did you see the Solimena?
It's very beautiful.
<i>The Assumption of the Virgin Mary.</i>
Have you been
to my home before?
Come. I have
something else to show you.
You like it?
Once upon a time,
people appreciated things of beauty
and filled their homes with them.
Lucky thing, too,
or we'd never have gotten them.
Come with me.
This way, please.
Let's close the door.
Please, sit down.
Coffee?
- No, thanks. I had some.
Now then, what is it?
Tell me all about it.
I'd like to withdraw
my candidacy.
Please don't take this
as a betrayal,
but I won't be
on the same slate as Nottola.
Our inquiry reveals half the city's
officials should be in jail,
and I'm to ignore it
and sit next to Nottola on the council.
Look here, my friend.
Cigarette?
You mustn't frame this
in moral terms.
Look at it
from the political angle,
because, like it or not,
Nottola and his gang are powerful,
and it's imperative that
we bring them over to our side.
Why is it imperative?
To win the majority.
Fine, so we win the majority.
We won't be able
to lift a finger against anyone.
Nottola won't change.
We all know his game.
And we're supposed
to just overlook it?
How can we guide public opinion
if we accept the likes of him?
My dear Balsamo,
we create public opinion.
A great party like ours
can swallow the likes of Nottola whole.
Think instead
of the responsibility of a politician
faced with this dilemma.
You have the chance to turn this around,
yet you refuse on the grounds
of moral incompatibility.
You don't destroy the Nottolas
of the world that way.
You merely pretend
they don't exist.
You speak as if power
were everything.
I run a hospital.
If I can't trust my own doctors,
what can I do?
Fire them, replace them,
whatever you like,
but only because
you're in charge.
But if I'd known I'd be working with
scoundrels, I'd never have taken the job.
And someone else would have,
perhaps someone less competent.
My dear Balsamo,
in political life, moral indignation
is a worthless commodity.
You know
what the only true sin is?
Losing.
NOTTOLA

RIGHT LOSES ON CITY COUNCIL
CENTER WINS MAJORITY
The fact there were people
like that among us
shows our party's in crisis.
- You're being naive.
- Would you stop counting the chips?
They're rats!
Men without honor.
A frenzy of betrayal -
that's what this was!
Don't take it so hard.
You only live once.
- We're better off without them.
- Politics is all a game.
How low can they stoop,
taking in those traitors!
I've been telling you all along.
Scoundrels without honor.
And she does nothing
but sleep.
Wake up.
It's late.
We have to go.
You play cards, talk business -
what do you expect?
Get up.
We're leaving.
They still have
to come to us.
Half the room is still ours.
- You're right.
Those rats! I'll make them pay.
I'll show them.
Get a move on.
It's 7:00.
Those skunks!
If any of you vote
for those skunks,
you're even bigger skunks
than they are!
The center will have our unconditional
support. That goes without saying.
But that man must never
become commissioner.
Councilmen,
please return to your seats.
In the election
for our new mayor,
the tally is as follows:
De Angelis, 47.
Scognamiglio, 28.
Various others, 5.
I hereby declare
Luigi De Angelis
our new mayor.
Let's hear it for the deal makers.
You struck quite a bargain.
This session will resume
after a half-hour recess
with our new mayor's opening remarks
and nominations for commissioner.
May I have the floor?
Councilman De Vita,
the session's in recess.
Later!
Don't you want
a cup of coffee?
My dear friend,
allow me to offer
my warmest congratulations.
We couldn't have asked
for a worthier man.
Ah, big words.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
You had our loyal support,
just as you will for commissioners.
So glad to hear it.
- Congratulations.
- Very kind of you.
Mr. Mayor, congratulations.
Of course, Nottola's name
must not appear on the slate.
We never agreed to that.
We told you
we were honor-bound.
As are we.
And not all your men agree.
- Excuse me.
- What is it?
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
They're playing dumb.
You owe
your newfound majority to us.
And without our votes,
you won't get your commissioners.
But we're all gentlemen here.
Each will pay his debt.
That's no way to talk.
We're not here to pay debts.
You mustn't doubt
the loyalty of our group.
There are no defectors
among us.
It's your ex-friends who oppose you.
Maglione vetoed your name.
Then make him lift his veto.
These aren't the real issues.
We're now responsible
for an administration
that must act
in everyone's interests.
That's how I see it,
and that's what I'll do.
We'll do
as we've agreed to do.
Let's keep our personal opinions
to ourselves.
So he's sitting next to you,
and now you'll make him commissioner.
- We'll see about that.
- You're being naive.
Numbers mean everything here.
We'll still be four votes short
to get rid of Nottola.
Where do we get them?
He doesn't have everyone's support.
Something could happen.
Let's be frank, Maglione.
What game are we playing?
Do we want to look like fools?
We agreed.
Nottola will not be commissioner.
You insist on nominating him?
We'll fight fire with fire.
What will that get you?
For starters,
you'd have to step down.
I see. So I step down.
Fine.
Then what?
Dissolve city council.
New elections -
which will go no better for you.
Meanwhile, with no mayor,
no governing committee,
and a special commissioner
from Rome,
all initiatives
will be put on hold.
No project of any kind.
No special fund.
You would bear full responsibility
for that before the city.
Who would all this benefit,
Maglione?
Certainly not you.
Listen to me.
We have to find a solution.
We all know
this is personal for you.
Set an example for this city
that has suffered so much
and expects great things
from us all.
Let us be worthy
of the political task we've taken on.
I've already spoken to Nottola.
For everyone's good,
you two must be friends again.
All done with your deals?
Come on.
Let's not waste any more time.
As I assume my position,
I wish to thank
and acknowledge
the entire assembly.
I consider my election
a display of trust in our party,
but most of all
in the policies
that will guide our actions.
Our city needs
a stable and efficient
administrative body.
Much has divided us
over the course of this campaign,
but the love we all feel for our city
can and must unite us.
I hope these criteria will guide us
in electing our commissioners,
and I hereby propose
we vote without further ado.
- May I have the floor?
- What for?
A point of order
that concerns the entire assembly.
Very well.
The new mayor
has described his election
as the expression of a desire
to ensure that the city
get a stable, proper and efficient
administrative body.
In other words, an election free
of politicking. Purely administrative.
It's not true.
This election is the clear result
of a political alliance
between the center
and the right,
involving men who were
just yesterday under investigation,
an investigation
demanded and supported
by the very same center.
Councilman De Vita,
your topic is not on the agenda.
But nominations
for commissioners are,
and we cannot proceed
without clarifying
the moral stance
of certain individuals
whose presence here
dishonors the entire assembly.
I demand
a suspension of the vote
and an investigation
into the moral issues
that make
Councilman Nottola ineligible.
I formally denounce
Councilman Nottola,
whom you would now elect
commissioner,
as the principal figure in a group
of unscrupulous businessmen
who wish to redirect
the expansion of the city
to land
entirely owned by them.
We must abandon
this unsustainable alliance.
Enough, please.
Councilman De Vita's proposal
is formally inadmissible.
However, I will abide
by the decision of the assembly.
We shall put the proposal
to a vote.
The left asks that
the proposal be voted on.
My group asks that
the proposal be rejected.
The center asks that
the proposal be rejected.
I ask that the proposal
be voted on.
And I declare
that if we were to vote,
we here would vote in favor.
Confronted
with such serious matters,
a man must answer
to his moral conscience
beyond all considerations
of politics or party lines.
I'm a simple man,
and I don't know
how to talk like De Vita,
who's succeeded in sowing discord
within our own ranks.
I stick to the facts.
I build buildings.
De Vita says
he has nothing against them
as long as they're built
as dictated by law.
But the law is made here.
We all make it together.
But apparently this doesn't suit
De Vita either.
You investigated me.
What did you discover?
Not a thing.
All this makes me wonder
if what you really want
is for those people
to go on living in hovels
so you can carry on
your usual propaganda.
It's true.
The law is made in this hall,
and you have greater power
at the moment.
We always will!
But you take advantage
of your political power
with no concern
for those who elected you.
The billions of lire
in the city's special fund,
which belongs
to all us citizens,
will be used only to legally
stuff your pockets -
your pockets -
using the laws
that will be passed here.
You'll be elected commissioner
here in this hall,
and perhaps you'll delude yourself
that everything goes on as before.
But things are changing.
Always, in every society,
when things begin to change,
someone tries
to grab everything he can.
Everything he can,
without concern for the needs
and hopes of the people.
And I speak not only
of those who live in hovels...
and whom he remembers
only when it's expedient.
Those who have been
your "subjects" are waking up
to their rights as citizens,
and you know it.
And so you fight,
within the law and outside it,
through corruption and force.
This is the truth.
Your revered Eminence,
Your Excellency,
ladies and gentlemen...
today I have
the rare opportunity
to inaugurate
a vast complex of public works
destined to make this new part
of the city self-sufficient.
This kind of development
clearly indicates
that this investment
of public funds
is yielding the results
we all hoped for,
results that are today
becoming reality.
It's with pleasure and pride
that I preside over this ceremony
and inaugurate a project
eagerly sought by the city
and fervently supported
by the national government.
Go ahead!
