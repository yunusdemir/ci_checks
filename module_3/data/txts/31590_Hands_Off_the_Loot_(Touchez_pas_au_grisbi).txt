Max, get a load of this.
50 MlLLlON lN ORLY GOLD BULLlON
ROBBERY... STlLL MlSSlNG
Here's your paper, Dede.
Come see us, Max.
You won't be sorry.
It was obvious during rehearsals.
It's our best show yet.
I think so, too.
It really isn't bad.
You tell him, Riton.
- You gotta come, Max.
Lola's a mermaid in the second number.
It'll give the johns heart failure.
Yeah, I know.
Where you going?
To play my tune.
- Here's the cake you wanted.
- It looks delicious.
Dig the squares.
Can we get some service here?
We're here for dinner.
- Sorry. All booked up.
- What about those tables?
- Reserved.
We can have drinks while we wait.
Try Victor's.
It's an excellent restaurant.
Just across the street.
- Victor's it is.
- Just tell them I sent you.
Those chumps just don't get it.
Already she's got an attitude!
She's right.
There's no room for you
if I take just anyone in.
You might've given them some cake.
Their mouths were watering.
I was closing.
Evening, Madame Bouche.
You almost got tossed out, Marco.
- You eat yet?
- No, I'm not hungry.
Hello, kid.
Sit down.
Bouche, bring him a fork.
Don't let this cake go to waste.
We blow enough dough here.
What'll you drink?
Bring him a coffee.
So, Max, you coming or not?
If you don't like it,
you can always take off.
Nobody's forced to stay.
I'll come,
but I can't promise I'll stay.
Marco can tag along.
If I split, he can keep you company.
Watching mermaids...
will be a change.
Something eating you?
You owe some dough here?
9,000.
Relax. I'll take care of it.
Why should you?
Put this on Marco's tab.
That's swell of you.
Give me my bill.
All ready.
Not hungry?
We're gonna be late.
- We already are.
- Ready?
I have to let you out.
- Swell dinner, Madame Bouche.
- Just fine.
I don't poison my customers.
You can't take a compliment.
Move it.
You have 1 1,000 credit here.
- How can I thank you?
- Skip it.
Sit next to your boyfriend.
Violets, lady?
1 00 francs. Cheap.
- I don't want any.
Be nice.
Dumb bitch.
- See you after the show?
- Yeah, right.
You'll still be hoofing it
when I start snoring.
Go on and snore...
at my place.
Stick around, Max.
It won't be any fun without you.
After midnight I always feel
like I'm doing overtime.
Stay anyway.
Lola's happy now.
I warned you about that stuff!
- Don't park it too far.
- I won't, Mr. Riton.
Don't just stand there.
Albert, a brandy.
Always late.
Next time I'll fine you both.
We'll be ready, madame.
Get dressed.
And none of your lip.
It's not their fault, Marinette.
We're just too irresistible.
We had to force 'em to come.
You expect thanks
for causing a flap in my henhouse?
I'll give you a nice table
for the floor show.
How's this? My best table.
- It's only natural, my pet.
- Ain't it though?
If you'll excuse me...
Don't bother.
A bottle of bubbly. Dry.
And make it good, eh?
Order a magnum for us three.
You're right. A magnum.
Hello, kid.
You made a hit, daddy-o.
That's Vera the Russki.
We got a thing going.
You've got your hands full.
Those babes are a real health hazard.
And away we go.
Mr. Angelo wants to see you
in Pierrot's office.
Excuse me.
Can I give you a hand
carrying all that?
You ought to know better, Mr. Max.
- Where you going?
- To see your man.
Come in.
- Hope you don't mind.
- Not at all.
How you doing, Fats?
Ramon, leave us alone.
You can take the wheels.
Here's what it's all about.
We're counting on your experience...
to referee a spat we're having.
Well?
You tell him.
You know I've always supplied
the dope here.
And never a gripe from anyone.
Pure stuff at the right weight.
Just a sec.
Hey, Ramon.
Don't need the keys?
What do you think of Ramon?
I don't think anything.
I couldn't give a damn about him.
All I know is Fats here
isn't crazy about him.
Anyway, I think you can work it out.
A matter of the right man.
I don't know, Max.
I don't think you know Ramon.
No. Anyway, your dope racket
is specialized.
You need a guy with style
who fits in among the clientele.
I run a serious house,
with good connections.
It's cost me.
I won't get closed down
just to be nice to Ramon.
Ramon's a bum.
Keep him as a driver.
It's all he's good for.
I've got an idea.
I think I have just the man.
Anyhow, I'll vouch for him.
If he's game,
I'll send him right up.
I like Max. He's a pal.
You mind?
Help yourself.
- Want some?
- No, thanks.
And when he likes someone...
he's a friend for life.
Take Riton, for example.
It's lasted 20 years.
From what I hear.
Yeah, they've been
a team for 20 years.
Now that's friendship.
The same goes for me and Max.
I've got something for you.
Got anything on now?
Angelo needs a guy to sell dope here.
He's got his own crew.
Pierrot doesn't like his crew.
So I gave you a plug.
They're waiting for you upstairs
to discuss it.
I vouched for you,
so don't louse things up.
So, porcupine-head?
I'm fed up. I'm splitting.
You staying?
Have one last drink.
For the road.
The road!
I've heard that one.
We may end up
having a bottle with Pierrot.
Then the girls will want us
to take 'em out for onion soup.
Then we gotta get it on.
- So?
No "so!"
I'm not in the mood. I'm beat.
Don't give me that.
I'll go tell Lola I'm going.
She might meet the pigeon
of her life tonight.
I don't want to ruin her career.
Thanks a million, Max.
The deal's on. You were swell.
Dry up.
Come on in.
No harm done.
I was just congratulating Josy.
And so you should.
I was out there... and Josy was tops!
She's a hoot, isn't she?
Well, I'm off.
Thanks for Marco.
Don't be stupid.
We gotta talk, Max.
What about?
I don't love Riton anymore.
It's been quite a while.
Why tell me?
Because you just saw me with Angelo.
And only you can make Riton see
he's gotta let me go.
Talk to him.
I don't have the nerve.
Angelo's right. You're a hoot.
He'd listen if you talk to him.
Don't be mad at me.
I need your help. I'm so afraid
of what might happen to me.
If you see Lola -
Skip it. Here she comes.
The dresser had to lower my neckline
to show more of my boobs.
Don't let me down.
Only you can help me.
Excuse me. I'm leaving.
I'm shot.
Not waiting for me?
Call that a man!
- Get in here!
That's the third time
the electrician jabbed my behind.
- I thought he only did it to me.
- You, too?
- Staying?
- I'm going, and so are you.
Listen, Riton...
Haven't you screwed around enough?
At your age? With your reputation?
That's what you look like now.
Look at those chumps.
Mr. Dugenet and his twitch.
Duglandin, the fatso over there.
And best of all,
Dufion, the bogeyman.
Dropping a bundle
while waiting to pick up showgirls.
And you're just like them.
Waiting patiently for madame
to get dressed to take her to the hotel.
You're a real jerk, old man.
A jerk? Why am I a jerk?
Ten years ago
you'd have waited for her
to come home with the bread.
Now she hasn't a chance
of meeting a john.
Whether she makes money now or not,
I don't give a damn.
All the more reason.
Start spoiling a broad
and she'll take off.
So go home to bed.
Josy knows the way home.
What's more,
a little worrying
will keep her in her place.
You're right. Let's go.
It's on the house.
Orders from the boss.
Thank him for us.
Drop you off?
I won't make you drive across town.
I'll take a cab.
See you tomorrow.
1 :00 at Bouche's.
25, Rue Alphonse Allais.
That ambulance is tailing us.
It passed the hospital.
To go to another hospital maybe.
Give it a little gas, just to see.
That's enough. Don't overdo it.
Your street's coming up.
We'll see.
Slow down.
My building's third on the right.
Take off and don't turn around.
So, Mr. Ramon,
this a new game?
Ambulance rally and surprise party?
We're not here for you.
Going to see the midwife maybe?
I'll wake her up for you.
You nuts, Max? Stop it!
A brandy. Got a phone token?
You don't need one. Go ahead.
Mr. Henri, please.
Mr. Henri what?
Henri Ducros.
I call him Mr. Riton.
Count me in for 50%
You won't regret it.
Excuse me, fellas.
Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
- Anybody with you?
I'm with Angelo and Bastien.
We're talking over a job.
Listen good, Riton.
Don't leave your room for anything.
There's something fishy
going on. Get me?
Sure.
Get rid of them fast.
Once they're gone, pick up again.
Just a sec.
Rotten luck, guys.
I can't come with you.
Family troubles.
I can't get out of it.
This is a real drag, Riton.
I was counting on you.
They're counting on me, too,
and have for a lot longer.
Had I known,
I'd have asked someone else.
You'll find someone.
- Sorry for the bother.
- No bother.
It's me who's sorry.
So long, guys.
Some other time.
Still there?
Are they gone?
Hold on.
They just drove off. What's up?
I'll tell you in person.
Take your heap and meet me
outside 40, Rue des Detroits.
Right, 40. Two times 20.
Near the Porte des Ternes.
Make sure you aren't tailed.
Gotcha.
We need more customers like him.
- Nobody shadowed you?
- No, I was careful.
Drive in here -
Shove over. I'll drive.
Where are we?
I got a place in the building.
We'll park in the garage.
What's this monkey business
with Angelo?
It's a long story.
I'll tell you upstairs.
It's about time you saw something.
Whose is this?
Mine.
Must have cost a million.
More than that, buddy.
It's a special.
How much?
Five million.
Come take a look.
Here's our piggy bank.
I stashed our loot in cartridge cases.
Two gold bars per case.
That makes 50 pounds.
Easier to carry this way.
And you run around
with our 50 million under your ass?
You nuts? I brought this heap over
straight from the factory
the night before our job.
The next day I stashed it away.
It's been here ever since.
See? I played it right.
Why d'you say that?
I don't get it, Max.
I'll explain upstairs.
Funny lock you got there.
Ever heard of burglars?
You never told me about this crib.
It's just a little investment.
I don't come here often.
Sit down. I'll be right back.
Not bad.
I almost like it better
than your other pad.
It's quieter.
The other one was quiet, too.
Not anymore.
Sit down, I said.
Try some of this.
It's from a pal in Nantes.
You'll have to settle for biscuits.
Dig in.
Remember tonight, at the club...
I left you to see Lola?
Know who was in her dressing room?
Josy and Angelo going at it
like there was no tomorrow.
Why didn't you tell me?
I keep my mind on serious business,
not on petting parties.
I don't mix the two.
I hope you get my drift.
Now tell me why you told Josy.
What can I say?
To keep her hanging on.
She told me I'd come to nothing,
that I'd never have a joint
like Pierrot and Marinette.
So I told her not to worry.
I had what we needed.
You're right. I'm a chump.
More like a dope, if you ask me.
But the real problem is Angelo.
What's Angelo after?
You really have no idea?
No idea why he invited you out
on a bum steer at 2:00 a. m.?
Use your brains, for once.
I still don't see.
I'll tell you.
To take you somewhere quiet
and work you over
to get our stash.
And for insurance,
he tried to snatch me, too.
Get the picture now?
I'll settle Angelo's score.
Sure you will.
Rub him and his boys out?
So? That's my business.
You're gonna keep us out of this.
This was my last job.
We were sitting pretty.
I'd been waiting for this.
I was fed up years ago
with all our bullshit.
I want to retire, understand?
I know, Max.
Get a load of your mug.
The bags under your eyes.
And mine.
And this, and this.
Think we're a pretty sight?
No, pal, it's time to sign off.
You're exaggerating.
Like hell I am.
I know what's what.
Poor Riton.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
Tomorrow, we swap our gold bars
for nice little banknotes.
I wanted to wait,
but you had to be a wise guy.
So we don't fix Angelo?
Nope. We even let him have Josy.
It'll do you a favor.
Not hungry?
We better turn in
if we're gonna get any shut-eye.
Some pajamas.
And a towel.
Here's a toothbrush.
There's toothpaste on the sink.
Take your own bed.
I can crash here.
Suit yourself.
About Josy,
what would you do in my shoes?
How should I know?
I'll never be in your shoes,
you knucklehead.
Hello, angel.
Your uncle's in a meeting.
You can wait in my office.
Put it down there.
This stuff's heavy.
As lovely as ever.
Be serious, Max.
He's your uncle, after all.
This way it stays in the family.
It's a pleasure to see
our friends in good shape.
You ignore them.
We haven't seen you in months.
Business, doll, business.
Count on me, sir.
Thank you, my good man.
Hello, Uncle.
Go on in. I'm in a hurry.
Take the other two.
I'm not taking any calls.
This all of it?
In what form?
Gold bars.
No certificates of origin, of course?
Maybe you'd like an invoice, too?
How much is there?
200 pounds.
This junk is heavy!
It's yellow stuff.
This the best you can offer me?
REWARD...
STOLEN SEPT. 5, 1 953 - ORLY AlRPORT
8 GOLD BARS - 25 POUNDS EACH
Think business is easy?
I'm not crazy about this.
Isn't it your line?
How much can you offer?
35 million.
You're way off the mark.
They're worth at least 50.
Sure, with a certificate of origin.
But I have to melt them down,
find fake reference numbers.
All that costs.
If you don't like it, I'm out.
Get them out of here.
This isn't a warehouse.
You're getting greedy, Oscar.
What about all the bloodsuckers
I have to pay off to keep quiet,
so that they don't have a chance
to get too nosy?
You gonna grease their palms for me?
Pour us some drinks.
You're all the same.
To you, a fence is a crook.
Don't waste your breath.
Just cough up.
35 million just like that?
Think I have that much on hand?
First, I have to get rid of them
one by one.
It'll take at least 1 0 days.
Gold coins would have gone quicker.
Cheers.
Not drinking?
- Never in the morning.
I want it in 1 0,000-franc notes.
Divided equally into two packets.
Count it out right.
I am your uncle, after all.
Ain't I lucky.
So long, kid.
As soon as it's ready,
call me at PER 5590.
My new place.
Relax, it'll all go smoothly.
Hold the line.
Just a second.
Forget about her.
Yes, what is it?
It's about time!
I want Miss Josy in Room 1 6.
She's out.
Have you seen Mr. Riton?
Who's calling?
Hello, Mr. Max.
Mr. Riton just left in an ambulance.
Did you see the ambulance?
What color was it?
I didn't notice.
What happened to Mr. Riton?
I don't really know.
You'd best ask Miss Josy
when she comes in. That all?
Yeah, that's all.
That Riton!
What a pain!
He's been a pain for years.
Always lousing things up.
What a dope!
Jesus, how dumb can you get!
He thinks he's a big shot
because he's got guts.
He may have balls,
but what a jerk!
I never should've hooked up
with a mug like him.
The jobs I could've pulled off
if I didn 't have him on my back.
Well, it's my own damn fault.
I should've worked on my own.
But I let feelings get in the way.
Well, that'll teach me.
But how'd I get mixed up
with a guy like that?
Not to mention the bread
he 's cost me for 20 years.
Forking out for his lawyers,
for his mother.
Not a tooth in his mouth
that hasn 't cost me a bundle.
Well, tough.
He 's on his own now.
- That you, Max?
- If it isn't you!
Are you free for lunch?
For you, always.
I 'd like to invite you over.
A wonderful idea, don't you think?
I'll just slip into another suit
and be over in half an hour.
See you soon.
Poor Riton.
I'm a real bastard.
Do you love me, Max?
Just a second.
You're a funny guy.
I don't really know who you are.
And that bugs you?
I have to go.
See you tomorrow?
- Hello, Mr. Max.
- Hello, kid.
Interested in working with me?
I need some backup.
We'll be dishing it out
but taking it, too.
I'll make it worth your while.
But I'm warning you.
It's no piece of cake. Well?
Sure thing. Riton's not with you?
No, that's just it.
I'll explain on the way.
Count me in.
There's something
I gotta do first.
There's fish soup
and roast chicken.
Take a look.
Looks nice, but I'm not eating.
Step outside.
Wait.
I'm on a job that may turn nasty.
I'm leaving you a few grand,
just in case.
If I get into hot water,
it'll cover the lawyers and packages.
You're the best.
Let's go, kid.
- Chez Bouche?
- This is it.
- Is Max there?
- Mr. Max? Who's calling?
It's Angelo.
You're out of luck. He just left.
Is he coming back?
I have no idea.
Open the door for me.
It's occupied.
There's someone there now.
Open up. It's me, Max.
I can't open now!
I tell you it's Max.
What did I tell you?
- I want to talk to you.
- I'm busy.
You gonna whine now?
Tell me what happened.
Talk! What happened?
I can explain, Max.
Were you here?
Then beat it.
I'm talking to Josy.
Riton was here.
They jumped him when he walked in.
Who?
First, Jojo...
Where was Jojo?
There, behind the door.
I'll show you.
He slugged him.
So he was in your room?
After you saw us together,
Angelo sent him over
to protect me from Riton.
Jojo makes one.
Who else was there?
Angelo was waiting next door
with Ramon.
But I didn't know.
Not until the porter phoned them.
I recognized Angelo's voice
just before Riton knocked.
That's a lie.
That's for starters.
So I suggest you start talking.
I told them he was coming up.
Maybe I was wrong to.
You sure were.
Where'd they take him?
I don't know, Max.
If I did, I'd tell you right off.
And Angelo's hideout?
Where did you make love?
In a hotel.
You know too much or too little!
Who asked you?
Do you know anything?
Honest to God,
I don't have any addresses.
What'd they pay to shut you up?
50,000 francs.
Let's have it.
I'll deal with you two later.
What should I do, Max?
They wanted to take me, too.
But I ran away.
Why'd you come back?
To get my things.
But I have no place to go.
Lola doesn't have room.
Poor little lost bitch!
Freeze.
Small world, isn't it?
Shove over.
How's Angelo?
How should I know?
We'll soon find out.
Pierrot in?
Hello, Fats. I need your help.
- What is it?
- But not if it bugs your woman.
Relax. Tell me.
Angelo and his boys
are giving me a hard time.
It started last night
and this morning they nabbed Riton.
I want to know where they took him.
Come with me.
The cellar's better.
- What're you gonna do?
- You'll find out, girlie! Move!
We're under the metro.
Nobody will hear your screams.
Now talk.
But I didn't do anything!
You weren't following me
to offer me candy. Punk!
Angelo wanted to know
where you stashed your loot.
What loot?
Tell him.
He said you pulled a job
worth 50 million.
It was you two?
Keep going.
He said if we nabbed you or Riton,
the other would squeal.
Where's Riton?
I don't know! I swear to God!
We're wasting our time.
Take off his jacket.
Listen good, Fifi.
We're gonna let you have it good.
If you tell us where Riton is,
you'll save us some time.
If you don't, you'll be real sorry.
Congratulations.
What are you doing here?
Who invited you?
There's a call for Max.
Who from?
Angelo. He'll call back.
I don't get it.
How can he know I'm here?
- I know how.
- Then talk.
Untie me first.
Stay with him.
Angelo?
That you, Max?
This is Angelo. You hear me?
Listen. There's no time to lose.
You want Riton back alive?
I'm listening.
I've got nothing against Riton or you.
All I want is your loot,
and within the hour.
I'll put Riton on
so you know he's here.
Yeah, it's me.
Don't give in.
Put Angelo on again.
Don't give in, Max.
Put him on, I said.
You heard him?
If you care about his health,
you better act quick.
You get me, Max?
Listen...
I propose a setup
that gives us equal guarantees.
Break out the rods
and bring that louse Fifi up.
Now listen good.
Put the loot in your car.
We're going places.
We're taking him upstairs.
- You're gonna do some work.
- Sure thing.
Nights are for sleeping.
I do my business during the day.
Let me get a word in!
You can say what you like.
I hate being woken up.
I can never get back to sleep.
Listen, I'm in a jam.
I need my merchandise right now.
Have Eugene bring my cases down.
Is he there?
I'll have to wake him up.
I'll be over in 1 0 minutes.
Thanks a lot.
Sorry for the bother.
Put it down here.
Sit down.
Help me with the hardware.
What do you want?
Come in and shut the door.
Thanks a lot, Max.
I'm sorry, Marinette.
Someone's on my back.
I had no choice.
We'll tell you about it later.
If we feel like it.
Take him with you.
I'll be right down. Go on.
You'll get your man back in no time.
You have my word.
At my age,
there's no second chance.
I said you have my word.
You leaving me here?
How am I gonna get back?
Try hunting snails, daddy-o.
Pass me the goods.
Hear that?
It must be them.
Here they come.
Looks like it.
Take it off.
What's it matter now?
Soon enough.
Get out, Riton.
Answer.
Go ahead, and watch out.
Hey, Marco...
- That's me, Marco.
- Don't say hello!
Hello.
Over this way.
Search 'em, Riton.
- Clean.
- That'll do.
Get moving.
Put 'em down there.
Now back off.
There.
I hope these gentlemen aren't armed.
We're not.
We're not either.
Marco, over here.
May l?
It's okay.
Ain't we lucky.
Wait till we're in the car.
Till then, no one moves.
You coming with us?
How about it?
I'd like to get to bed.
We're off.
Behave yourselves.
For your own good.
Move it!
I tell you, they had two cars.
I was blindfolded,
but I heard the other engine.
Look!
Take cover!
Move back more.
We're in the open.
I think I sprained something.
Turn around.
They got him good.
They won't get away with it.
We won't get far in this.
Riton, get their car, fast.
Go get Marco.
Where the hell are they?
Here they come!
Floor it!
The tires! Aim for the tires!
Give me a hand! The loot!
What?
What?
Let's get out of here.
You shouldn't all be in here.
He needs peace and quiet.
What do you think, Doctor?
He's tough.
He's already waking up.
Still here, Max?
So, porcupine-head?
Pierrot, tell him to go.
Where's the fire?
Go out, Max. Show yourself.
Go to the restaurant.
What time is it?
6:00 in the morning.
Riton's right.
You'd better leave.
I'm off.
See you later, Doctor.
- Good-bye, Max.
You can come back after lunch.
See you later.
GUN BATTLE ON COUNTRY ROAD
You and your theories!
You gotta stop going to the movies.
I never go to the movies.
They hurt my eyes.
Get yourself glasses!
So, what about it?
The papers made it all up.
But it's Angelo's photo!
What's a photo prove?
You could be run over tomorrow,
and your picture'll be
in the papers with any old story.
So the Orly job was just a stunt?
He didn't say that.
But it wasn't Angelo.
Angelo would never get mixed up
in something like that.
Bouche, my cigarettes.
I'm all out.
But it was Angelo in the car
with the loot, wasn't it?
How do you know it was him?
They found his ring.
The old ring trick!
You can ask him.
You're not so bad-looking.
My friend Betty.
You haven't met her.
I've told you about Madame Bouche.
Sit down there.
Excuse me.
- How about it, Max?
- What?
- Haven't you seen the papers?
- Sure, why?
You knew Angelo.
Tell him what you think.
We've been discussing it for hours.
That's swell of you,
but I'm going to have lunch.
How do you do it?
Well, you know...
That old devil Max.
Order what you like.
I'm having roast beef.
I have to make a call.
Get me Mr. Pierrot.
Hold the line.
It's Mr. Max on the phone.
Riton's dead, Max.
Coming over?
I only just arrived at Bouche's.
Leaving now would look funny.
You're right.
Take your time eating.
The main thing's to be seen in public.
Sure. See you later.
You wear glasses now?
I never noticed.
They're for reading.
You'll need them soon enough.
Do I hold on to your money?
For the time being.
You ready for us?
- Go and sit down.
I'm not mad!
You're a bore!
Let's hear your story.
- But you know it.
- No, I don't.
Well, it's too late.
And he says he's not mad.
Say, Max,
Bebert's angry about Angelo.
Just deal and shut up.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
What's the ante?
- 3,000.
- If you want.
