(Children laughing and shouting)
(Doors crashing open)
(Clattering)
(Rats squeaking)
(Man) What do you see, David?
Easy, you guys.
Nobody's going anywhere.
What is it?
(Sheriff) Oh, my God!
Death in heartland America.
A tragedy of macabre proportions.
I can honestly tell you
that I have never seen
anything as shocking as
what was discovered earlier today
in this sleepy little farming
community of Gatlin, Nebraska.
Over 50 bodies in various stages of
decomposition have been discovered,
making this one of the most gruesome
mass murders in the country's history.
(Man) So far we've only
accounted for... about half the town.
What those kids did...
...you should all pay for this.
Can you tell us exactly what you saw?
Mr Simpson?
Can you tell me what happened?
Did you see anything?
I saw the corn.
The children came under
the influence of several teenagers.
The leader of this cult group
is Isaac Chroner.
That's from a report by a young
couple passing through on vacation.
Did you see what happened
to your mommy and your daddy?
I... I saw the corn.
OK, cut it.
What is all this shit about the corn?
(Man on radio)
'We must rise against our fears
'and let the Lord's spirit
fill us with strength.'
- Turn that down, please.
- (Man on radio) '... may reach salvation.'
(Woman on radio) 'Let us pray.
'O Lord, let the evil... '
Turn it down!
(Man on radio) 'The Lord cares not
if we have fallen... '
- I said turn it down!
- (Horn honking)
Nice fucking driving.
Your mother teach you to talk like that?
Only when your name came up.
That's real funny now, isn't it?
My ass is on the line.
Maybe you don't know that.
If I mess up this job, I'm screwed.
You understand what I'm saying?
Do you want me to apologise again?
Is that it?
Sorry, John, I missed my flight.
- Start by calling me Dad.
- (Laughing) Yeah, right.
Why would I want to do that?
Oh, you think I should feel grateful
just because you usually
remember my birthday?
It's not like you suddenly called up
and said, "Hey, you know, Dan,
we should get together.
"We should spend some time together."
(Man) Open wide. Stick out your tongue.
(Reporter) The surviving children are being
bussed to Hemingford, 19 miles away,
where they'll be fostered
until permanent arrangements are made.
This is Bob Collins reporting.
All right, young man. Step up here.
Come on, now.
Open up wide. Open wide.
- Open. Ah.
- Aah.
Very nice. Very nice.
Now, don't forget your sucker.
Hi. How are you, there? Open wide, now.
No, the only reason I'm here is
Mom didn't want me at her wedding.
Wrong.
The way I heard it is you and
what's-his-name don't even talk anymore.
Shithead.
His name's Sherman.
Right. Shithead Sherman.
You got a real attitude problem.
(Chuckling)
Yeah, well, I guess that's genetic, huh... Dad.
Where in the hell are we?
Go on! Get out of my way!
Don't you move that bus! Stop it!
Stop right there! Don't you move one inch.
Out of the way, folks.
Come on, Mrs Burke.
Let's get this over with.
Over my dead body!
If we let those children in our houses
we'll end up dead, just like those people did.
Now, Mrs Burke... Oh!
Mrs Burke, Mrs Burke! Haven't
these children been through enough?
The children? What about their parents?
They murdered their own parents!
Those involved with the killings are dead.
You have a big, empty house.
Why not volunteer it, like I have?
I don't want those children. I know them all.
I taught school in this town all those years
till I had the good sense to leave.
I know. What happened is over, Mrs Burke.
Now, come on.
You got no need to die so young.
I'm taking my house
and I'm getting out of here.
- Don't you try to stop me!
- (Sheriff) Come on.
(Reporters clamouring)
(Man) There's a stop sign. Stop sign, man!
(Horn honking)
Hey! You crazy son of a bitch!
It's Garrett! It's Garrett, man.
Hey, ragman. How's it going?
How's the tabloid business, huh?
I loved your piece on JFK and
his secret marriage to Rock Hudson.
- (Men chuckling)
- All right. What happened here?
Some kids killed all the town's adults.
Just your basic Bible Belt Sunday afternoon.
Wait. Killed them all?
It's no worse than Jonestown.
- Where are the kids now?
- Try 'Film at 11'.
You'll love my wrap-up. We're out of here.
Hey, don't look so down.
Just make something up.
That's your specialty, isn't it?
- (Men laughing)
- You're an asshole.
It's nice to see your friends
like and respect you.
Yep. Nice short cut, Bobby.
I'm telling you, the highway's
just over there. Relax, man.
- Where?
- It's right over the hill.
Turn left over here.
- The highway's over...
- Turn left here!
(Sighing)
I want a shot of this corn, all right?
This might be a short cut
to the highway anyway.
(Eerie whispering)
Oh, man, we missed everything.
Good. Let's get out of here.
No. Not without the story.
So make it up.
It's your specialty anyway, isn't it?
Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm a reporter.
Do you mind if I ask you some questions?
Actually, I would.
Besides, I don't have any answers.
- Just one question.
- OK, one.
Do you know a place we can stay the night?
It's just my son and me.
We want something real simple.
You know, like, down-home,
cosy and comfortable.
- Pays to advertise, huh?
- Do you have any vacancies?
A room with twin beds for 30 bucks.
- Great.
- Follow me.
(Tyres screeching)
- (Horn honking)
- Well, excuse me.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this was a great idea.
Stop the van.
Pisses me off.
- Well?
- Get out.
How the hell did we get out here?
(Thunder crashing)
I've got a bad feeling about this.
I don't like it.
(Eerie whispering)
Let's get out of here.
Come on!
Come on, Bobby. Start the damn thing.
Jesus Christ, man, it looks like a twister!
- Get out of the van.
- Huh?
Come on! Get out!
Mac!
Mac!
Bobby!
Mac!
I can't see! Help!
Bobby! Bobby!
M-Mac!
Mac!
(Yelling in pain)
Bobby!
(Groaning)
Come on! Come on, window.
Wind up. Come on!
Come on, come on!
Come on! Start, you piece of junk!
No!
(Danny) Ah, that was really good.
Good. Can I take your plate?
Why don't you help?
Help the lady.
- Thank you, Danny.
- Sure.
Micah.
Did you see what happened?
Some of it.
Like what?
My parents.
You saw what happened to them?
I saw the corn.
What do you mean, corn?
Were they out in the cornfield?
Their blood was for the corn.
Leave him alone.
- I was just asking a couple of questions.
- I know what you were doing.
Who do you write for, anyway?
(Laughing) The World Inquirer.
He's a ragman.
Well... yes and no.
I mean, I used to write for Newsweek.
The editor and I,
we had a difference of opinion.
I thought she was incompetent
and she didn't.
Just chalk it up to youthful mistakes.
Is there anything you haven't
chalked up to that?
Would you mind excusing us for a minute?
Sure.
Outside. Now.
I've about had it with you.
I'm fully aware that you don't
want to be here with me,
but, bub, you're no picnic for me either.
The last thing I need is you giving me shit.
Just love these father-and-son chats.
- Give me a break, please!
- Why?
What for? What did you ever do for me?
You got my mother pregnant,
and here I am.
Hey, you listen to me now.
Your mother and me,
we just couldn't make it work.
We had our own agendas.
And that didn't include me?
No, it didn't. As a matter of fact, it didn't.
I won't bullshit you.
I was 17 and I made a mistake.
You deal with that any way you can.
I'm still trying.
If you can figure it out better than me,
that's fine,
but who you are,
good or bad, is your choice.
If it's my choice,
I'm on the next bus out of here.
Wait. Whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey! Get back here!
Don't worry. It'll be OK.
No, it won't be OK.
He'll go and do something
stupid just to spite me.
(Woman) Trust me. He'll be back.
You with all the reporters?
Sort of.
So what are you doing?
Just waiting for the next bus.
Good move.
You know, you might want
to get a couple magazines.
The next bus isn't till Tuesday.
Adults are dead,
yet the children of those adults...
Corn. Blood for the corn.
Why?
(Micah) Mordechai?
Jedediah?
Come on, guys, where are you?
This isn't funny!
Mordechai!
Jedediah!
Where are you?
(Micah) Guys?
Where are you?
Are you there?
M... Mordechai?
(Growling)
(Micah) No!
- No!
- (Howling)
Argh! Ugh!
No!
Help! Argh!
(Girl whispering) He took one again.
(Boy whispering) Hear that?
(Screaming)
- (Micah) Argh!
- What was that?
I don't know.
What do we do, Mordechai?
- We wait.
- For what?
For He Who Walks Behind the Rows
to show us the way.
- And what if he doesn't?
- He will.
- Isaac said...
- Isaac's dead!
He told us when there were no more adults
we'd see the truth.
Well, where is it?
It is written -
a leader will come from the corn,
he shall make us one.
There ain't nothing out there,
Mordechai, except a lot of corn.
Stupid old corn.
(Scoffing) Maybe that's your truth.
Look, you can hang around here
if you want to.
But we're out of here.
(Micah screaming) No!
He Who Walks Behind the Rows
shall not allow it.
Do you really think it was
all Isaac's doing, Jedediah?
Do you?
Who here thinks this?
Were we not given signs?
Was that not enough?
But they found them.
And they found us.
Jesus Christ, Micah, they know our parents.
They were adults!
They were of that world.
We have seen the way of that world
and it is evil.
There is a power greater than all
and it is within us.
But we know it not.
We have eyes but see it not
and ears but hear it not.
I saw the light that came from the corn.
He Who Walks Behind the Rows
commands that we rid the land
of all that defileth the corn.
You do not see the truth, Jedediah,
because it is not yet with us.
There is work to do before he cometh.
Go home
and wait for a sign.
Jesus Christ!
Micah?
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing out here?
Well, I just... I-I saw the kids
and the flashlights and I was...
Yeah. Well, it's fun to play at night.
Yeah, I guess.
So, were you in town?
Yeah, I was going to leave,
but, er, I... ran into this girl.
She's... she rides a motor scooter.
You know her?
Mm-hm. Lacey Hellerstat.
She's pretty hot.
Yes. She's pretty hot.
So, are you gonna go home now or what?
Sure.
(Birds twittering)
(John) I'll be right back.
(Danny) Fine.
(Screen door opening)
(Mrs Burke) Little devils!
Get away from here!
Every one of you, move!
Looking for answers? It's out there.
Terrible things.
- What are you talking about?
- Have you ever seen evil?
It works through the children.
Nobody would listen.
I told them in Gatlin. I showed them.
- Showed them what?
- The drawings.
By the little children.
They knew. They knew.
My husband walked into a cornfield
15 years ago.
He never came back.
That's why I'm moving out of here
and taking my house with me.
(Chanting and rattling)
God... damn you!
Damn you!
What the...?
Well, boy, that was a mistake.
So, did you get your story yet?
What do you think?
There's nothing to do around here.
Now, how do you know that? Huh?
How do you know?
Why not check it out first?
There might be more around than corn.
If there is, let me know.
I can use the help.
Listen, for what it's worth,
I appreciate that you didn't
take off last night.
I didn't have much choice.
Look, I'm going to walk, OK?
(Muttering angrily)
Oh, God! Come on...
It is like the light from the corn.
Not from the hand of man, but the mark
of He Who Walks Behind the Rows.
Then it is our sign?
Yes.
Let it begin.
You just going to stand there?
Haven't you ever seen a girl before?
Er...
No, no. I've never seen a girl before.
Well, can you swim?
Fornication.
Fornication, my friends,
is a pestilence.
Look at each other.
Go on. Look closely at each other.
Go on. Look closely.
That pestilence can dwell
inside each and every one of us.
But before we can conquer it,
we must first recognise it.
Now, we here in Hemingford
have just witnessed a terrible tragedy.
Our good neighbours in Gatlin
have been called home to glory.
(Mrs Burke) Elmira?
Elmira!
Elmira, where in the world are you?
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty!
- (Eerie whispering)
- Kitty, kitty, kitty!
I am in no mood
to have to go chasing after you.
- (Meowing)
- Kitty, kitty! Here, kitty!
Here, kitty! Come on, you fool cat!
Where are you?
(Whispering) Here, pussy cat! Here!
Elmira!
Elmira!
Where are you? That fool cat! Elmira!
Come on, cat! Here, kit, kit, kit, kitty!
Here, kitty! Come on, kitty!
Elmira! Why don't you talk? Darn cat!
You're driving me crazy.
Elmira!
(Gasping)
Oh, my God.
Nice kitty.
You bastards!
You dirty little bastards!
You get away from me!
You get the hell away from my house!
(Mrs Burke wailing and screaming)
You stop that! You get away! (Screaming)
What a world! What a world!
(Children laughing)
(Lacey) So, where are you from?
(Danny) Long Island, New York.
New York? Oh, my gosh.
I've always wanted to go there.
It's OK.
Sure, I mean, for you,
because you grew up there.
You should try growing up here.
There's nothing -
nothing to do, nothing to see,
nobody interesting to talk to.
Yeah, I used to feel that way
about this place.
So how long will you be in town?
Until my father finishes his story.
What?
I don't know. Um...
(Laughing) It's strange
calling that guy my father.
What is it between you?
You guys don't spend a lot of time together?
We don't spend any time together.
Anyway...
Hey, um... did you know
any of those kids from Gatlin?
(Scoffing) Are you kidding?
I went to school with them.
I never fit in. I guess I always
wanted to be somewhere else.
But I swore to myself,
the day I turn 18, I am out of here.
So what about your parents?
They're dead.
I'm sorry.
- God. You mean they...?
- No, it wasn't in Gatlin.
It was a car accident.
My aunt and uncle took me in
so I moved here.
I left before that stuff happened.
What?
Take me to New York with you.
- What? I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.
The Bible tells us
that one must become as a little child
to find the path from sin.
- Yet there are some...
- (Groaning)
David?
What's the matter?
I don't know.
I think I'm coming down with a cold.
- (Sighs)
- Here.
(Reverend Hollings) It is as bad
to find evil where it does not dwell
as to fail to see it where it does.
(Mystical chanting)
(Reverend Hollings) Heavy metal music
blaring out its profane message
to the waiting ears
of our impressionable children.
Movies are filled with violence, blood,
and bodies, naked bodies,
writhing together, glorifying fornication!
We are undone
by our grievous animal desires.
And that is why
you must look into yourselves
to see if there is evil
because that is where the evil lurks.
Evil!
Evil just waiting...
Gee. Do you have another?
Gee!
(Reverend) It was their innocence that...
(Mary screaming)
(Mary) Oh, David! Here.
David!
Oh!
(Mary screaming)
Argh!
You've gotta help me!
(Screaming)
(Reverend Hollings)
Come away, Mary. Come away!
- (Mary screaming) No!
- Come away.
David. No!
(Mary sobbing)
(Mary sobbing) David! No!
(Dramatic surging, heart pulsing)
(School children singing and playing)
(School children laughing and talking)
(Teacher) All right,
I need two people up at the board.
Eddie... Caroline.
Come on up and write
these figures on the board,
and then give us an answer.
(Clattering)
Ugh!
Ugh! You scared the hell outta me!
Who are you and why are you here?
Isn't that just like a white man?
Assumes he has the right to be here
and no one else does.
All right, let's try it another way.
What do you know about all this?
I know you're John Garrett,
reporter for the World Inquirer,
35 years old in April...
and you weigh 185 pounds.
Wait a minute. Hey, hey. How the hell
do you know all that about me?
Even in a ghost town...
...don't leave your wallet
in a car that's not locked.
(John) Hey, wait a minute!
Hold on a second. Wait a minute.
All right, look,
I'm sorry about that back there.
It's just, uh... What's your name?
Frank Red Bear.
Frank Red Bear, I'm Garrett.
- Yes, I know.
- Yeah.
Can you tell me anything about
what happened around here?
- Koyaanisqatsi.
- Excuse me?
Koyaanisqatsi. It means "life out of balance".
My ancestors would've told you
that man should be at one
with the earth, the sky, the water.
But the white man
has never understood this.
He only knows how to take.
And after a while, there's nothing left to take
so everything is out of balance...
and we all fall down.
Wait a minute.
So that's what happened here in Gatlin?
No, what happened in Gatlin
was those kids went apeshit
and killed everybody.
Right. But why?
The Amish say we don't inherit
the land from our ancestors,
we only borrow it from our children.
Maybe they wanted it back.
Wait a sec.
This school teacher here, this Mrs Burke.
She said the kids knew about it.
It's in all their drawings.
- Look at these.
- Yeah.
These kids watch too many horror flicks.
No, they drew these before this happened,
and weren't in on it, so how did they know?
Beats the hell outta me.
(Starting car engine)
Hold on a second! How do I get hold of you?
You can reach me
through the State University -
department of anthropology.
Just ask for me - Dr Red Bear.
That shit ate right through my pants.
Oh, my God, it's Ruby!
It's Ruby! Who killed my sister?
It was an accident, Ms West.
Not with them around it wasn't!
She warned you.
She warned all of you!
What did you do to her?
My God.
Sheriff... I am not gonna let this drop!
Get me out of here, goddammit!
You're blind, you fools!
You fools!
You let the wolf in your door!
That's what you did! You stupid idiots!
Take her to Doc Appleby's.
I'll call the coroner.
OK, Sheriff.
I've gotta check on some things.
Stick around here till I get back.
Wha...? Where's here?
Here. Here! Why are you all wet?
I was swimming. There's this
watering hole just down the way.
I met a girl and we...
Wait, hey, I don't want you hanging
around with these kids around here.
That's good, you know?
First you say, "Check it out,
there's more than corn there,"
and now I can't hang out with anyone.
- Why not?
- I said so.
- Why can't you trust me?
- No, just do what I told you.
Another argument?
Yeah... yeah, I can handle it. It's fine.
You know, Danny, I used to have
problems with my father too.
Adults are such hypocrites.
It's like the moment a person turns 19,
they become this thing.
What thing?
Well... with my father,
if we listened to the radio, we sinned.
If we talked to girls, we sinned.
And every sin demanded a beating.
To chase away the devil.
And then one day...
I caught my father with the farmhand's wife.
Sinning most vigorously.
Micah... were you glad
when your father was killed?
The Bible also teaches that, um...
for everything there is a season.
You actually see a connection between
a nose bleed and the house falling?
Yeah, they're both dead.
It seems to happen a lot around here.
You notice that?
I don't appreciate your humour.
Well... what could make a man
bleed to death like this, then?
I wouldn't know.
You don't have a lot of statistics
on nose-bleed deaths, is that it?
I'll tell you one thing -
we know what killed
old Ms Burke here, don't we?
Did you ever notice a green mould or dust?
No.
Sure bothered her. It was on her door.
I've got no idea.
(Zipping up body bag)
I don't snoop around other people's doors.
She was talking about the corn.
I guess that bothered her too.
Her husband walked out into
a cornfield about 15 years ago
and never came back.
Oh, he... walked out, all right.
Right into the arms of a waitress in Omaha.
Mrs Burke became quite mad. Crazy.
I wouldn't put much stock in what she said.
Well, now, maybe it was the truth
that made her crazy.
Ever think of that?
The kids around here -
they talk about the corn too.
You think they had anything to do with this?
- I didn't say anything of the kind.
- No, you didn't.
But you were thinking it, weren't you?
You know what your problem is, Mr Garrett?
You don't care about what happened here,
so long as it makes a good story.
You don't know what it is to have
your whole livelihood resting on the land.
It changes things. It changes everything.
Now, if you will excuse me...
I've got a lot of work to do.
Thanks for your time.
(Car engine starting)
'Sheriff Blaine.'
- He was here.
- 'Did you tell him anything? '
Of course I didn't!
For Christ's sake...
what do you think I am, an idiot?
- 'Well, does he know what's going on? '
- No, but if he stays around here, he will.
Oh, Jesus.
We have sinned and we're going to hell.
(John) Hey, wait a second.
Wait a second!
These shoes cost me 135 bucks!
Whoa. Whoa.
Man, I knew I never
should've even called you.
This is what I wanted to show you.
My people believe
that this area was very special.
- Don't you mean weird?
- No. This place has power.
Power that can magnify good or bad.
You can see by the drawings
that the children were
particularly vulnerable.
They feel the vibrations.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, legend has it that a tribe of farmers
lived here a long time ago,
but the adults became lazy
and they stopped farming.
They began to abuse the animals
and the land.
Now, you can see by these
that the children rebelled
and killed their parents, like in Gatlin.
Wait. What is this over here?
Well, that's a traditional Indian burial.
And all this along here?
This indicates that
the spirit will open the corn
and let through one who finds truth
within himself.
Right, so why this flat line
across here then?
Well, that line means it hasn't happened.
So, do you really take
all this bullshit seriously, huh?
You're a university professor,
for Christ's sake.
Sometimes what you've learned
conflicts with what you know.
(John) All right, but what exactly is this?
(Menacing snarling)
(Man on radio) '... will be the ruin
of us all - sexual perversion!
'Now the simple rule of
love thy neighbour as thyself
'reduced to pornographic obscenity.
'What have we become?
'A deranged reality of
the new Sodom and Gomorrah?
'No! There is redemption.
'There is redemption!
'The Lord said, "Be kind to those
who know not what they do."
'And that is why we are here tonight.
'To lift thine eyes to the heavens,
'to see the true spirit of the Lord
and to ask for forgiveness.
'Now, we have sinned against
each other and against our own selves.
'But there is a way to salvation.'
(Radio static buzzing)
(Clattering)
Who's there?
Who's there?
Ugh!
The earth shall be cleansed
of those who poison earth and its youth.
- It is written.
- You don't know what you're doing!
Ye shall suffer for the sins of others.
Repent that which you have sinned.
You kids are in... in serious trouble!
Argh! Oh! Argh! Oh!
(Doll) I like to play!
Argh! Argh! Ugh!
Argh!
(Doll) My mommy says I'm smart!
(Giggling)
Tell me something.
What are you doing here?
Why are you here?
I don't know exactly.
I mean, I was a sales executive
pulling in 100 grand a year...
Oh, come on. $100,000?
Yeah. I was hot stuff.
I had a penthouse condo, beautiful sunsets,
great sex with a scumbag attorney.
- But that's all it was.
- What's that?
Sex.
And when Aunt Bea died,
I just sold the condo and moved here.
There's something here I like.
Yeah, me too.
Dad...
Sinning most vigorously.
And in my vision, I saw a circle of light.
And the lights moved faster and faster.
And in the centre of the light was a stalk.
And a voice spoke, commanding me
to cleanse the stalk of its poison...
To make it pure again.
Are you ready to join us, Ruth?
I'm ready.
The sower of seeds must be a child
so that what is planted is without corruption,
untainted by the poisons of age.
With the harvest moon tomorrow night,
our reign of peace shall dwell upon the land
and the sword of righteousness
shall strike down the infidel.
Now...
let Gatlin and Hemingford
be joined forever.
We are one.
We are one!
We are one.
(All chanting) We are one!
We are one. We are one.
We are one. We are one.
We are one.
We are one.
Come forward.
Come forward.
This is Danny.
He too has found problems among them.
Will you be a soldier for
He Who Walks Behind the Rows?
Do you wish to be as one?
Yes.
This is your favourite place?
Well, sort of.
Come on. I want to show you.
Isn't this great?
Don't you feel like
you could look at that forever?
That's why I love it here.
I look out there toward the horizon,
I almost see myself out there -
far away from here.
Don't tell me you're afraid of heights.
No. Well...
I mean, I wouldn't say afraid.
But one time I went to the top
of the Statue of Liberty, I, um...
You know, I... I barfed on her dress.
(Laughing)
Well, if you barf, I'm not going to kiss you.
Whoa. Well, then I won't barf.
Are you OK?
- You feel better?
- Yeah.
- A lot better?
- Yeah, I feel better.
Good.
Cos if you can catch me,
you can have me.
Where are you going?
- Come on!
- (Groaning)
(Laughing)
(Lacey giggling)
(Screaming happily)
(Squealing and laughing)
- (Danny shouting)
- What?
Come back! Lacey.
(Lacey) Hurry up!
(Squealing and laughing)
(Lacey squealing)
(Danny laughing)
(Laughing)
Something's back there.
I'll get it. I'll get it.
(Screaming)
- Wh-what is that?
- Uh...
What is it?
What are you doing?
Oh, God.
(Danny) Oh, God.
(Lacey) Oh, my God.
It must be the bodies they never found.
Danny, come on. Let's get out of here.
- Look at all this corn.
- Yeah, look at it.
What the hell is this stuff doing here?
It's where they store it, isn't it?
They're supposed to be harvesting
all that corn out there.
This should be empty.
What the hell is this stuff doing here?
My God. This is last year's corn.
That green stuff is... is... is aflatoxin,
an ergot mould.
Toxic as hell. It grows on the corn.
My God, some people think all
the chemical pesticides contribute to it.
I mean, this silo's full of it.
If it's toxic, why are they hanging onto it?
To blend with this year's crop.
- What, to hide it?
- No, to sell it.
There's a hell of a lot of money
tied up in this harvest.
Doc Appleby knew. He was talking about it.
Exposure to this stuff can poison, too.
- Simpson.
- He didn't even have to eat it.
All he did was breathe it. We all breathed it.
The dust off this corn
must have blown clear over the valley.
Why doesn't it affect more people?
It does. They just don't know it.
It could be a cold or a cough.
The immune system has
different ways of handling it.
Over time, when it's eaten
at you long enough,
aflatoxin can cause...
God, it can cause madness,
it can cause panic, hallucinations,
especially in chil...
Especially in children.
- In children particularly.
- (Car approaching)
(Car door opening)
Hey, Sheriff, I think we got a problem.
I think you may be right.
(Mrs West) Get that thing away from me!
Don't think you can scare me,
you little punks.
Get out of here.
Watch this.
What's going on here? Help!
What have you done to my chair?
(Screaming)
N-39.
Help! You little bastards!
(Screaming)
Somebody has to help me. Help me!
- Will somebody help me?
- (Horn honking)
(Screaming)
Can somebody help me?
What's going on here?
Somebody help me, please!
- (Screaming)
- O-54.
(Screaming) Somebody stop this thing!
Thank you.
Thank you, Lord. Thank you.
(Horn blasting)
(Screaming)
(Brakes squealing)
O-65.
Yeah! Yeah!
Bingo?
No, nobody's home.
(Lacey) 'My aunt left a note
about a town meeting. We gotta... '
(Line disconnecting)
Hello? Lacey? Hello? Hello?
It's time, Danny.
The soldiers of the Lord are ready to march.
So Doctor Appleby was in on this, too?
Along with a few others.
The government will nail you
when they test that corn.
Actually, they only test
a portion of the shipment.
If you pay the right folks,
they only test the good parts.
The government's changing their standards
to help the economy so why can't we?
That aflatoxin may kill
a lot of innocent people.
- You'll take that chance?
- I'm going to kill you two, ain't I?
(Laughing)
So you really think
you can get away with this?
Sure I can. I'll be heading
the investigation into your murder.
Some people still think the only good Indian
is a dead Indian.
- Fuck you, pencil-dick.
- (Laughing)
Why don't you just shoot us?
I'd actually have to explain that
and someone might not believe me.
This... I don't have to explain this.
Who could? It doesn't make sense.
Which is the beauty of it.
It'll be a mystery... unsolved.
It'll be part of the folklore of the valley.
It's also a terrible way to die.
Oh, uh, I'd love to sit and chat
but there's a town meeting.
Some people are actually worried
about problems with our
sweet, innocent children.
You boys are going to love this!
Like a big quasinart, ain't it?
Try and get this out of the ground.
One, two, three!
Come on now!
One more!
Three! Come on!
One... two...
(Shouting)
- Argh!
- Roll over on your side. Come on!
(Door opening)
Ruth, what are you doing here?
This is for you.
What do you mean, for me?
It's time. You must be dressed.
Don't. Let me go.
Let me go! (Screaming)
God, it's McKenzie.
Over here.
And that's Bobby.
Don't try to tell me
some goddamn poison corn did this.
You level with me.
What in the fuck is going on here?
Einstein was right.
We didn't evolve out of random chance.
There's a higher power controlling all of this.
My ancestors believed in a spirit -
a spirit of the earth,
a god who seeks revenge
for the wrongs done to the earth.
- This is what's happening.
- Bullshit!
That's your answer?
That God did this? That God's pissed?
You've got a better one?
(Chattering)
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi, Bob.
- Sheriff.
- How are you, Bob?
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends and neighbours.
We can't wait.
We need to get the meeting started.
Come dawn, a lot of you want to be
in the field for harvest.
We need to get the meeting under way.
- But people are still missing.
- We can't wait.
Reverend, would you lead us
in the invocation?
Yeah, sure.
Lord, let your wisdom cleanse our hearts
and guide our minds
so that our actions are free
from fornication, lies, debauchery, lust
and all manner of sin and damnation.
- Amen.
- (All) Amen.
Thank you, Reverend.
Some of you agreed
to take in the Gatlin children.
Some expressed a desire
to file for adoption,
so I've got some information on that.
Yes, Mary?
I have something to say.
It's about the children.
There's something out there.
There's something... It's evil.
It's gotten a hold of our children.
- Speak to her, Reverend.
- (Consoling) Mary. Mary Simpson.
We love you dearly
and we grieve for the loss
of your dear husband and your sister.
But to blame every affliction
on the children of Gatlin...
- That's not it!
- It's just not Christian.
Perhaps we should ask
the children to leave.
What? The children.
- The children are here.
- Please try to control yourself.
The sweet children of Gatlin
have chained the door.
What? All right, children, the prank's over.
Open the door.
Oren, they've got matches
and they've got gasoline!
(Woman) What?
- (Sheriff) Somebody help me!
- (All screaming)
Wait till I get those little bastards.
- You... (Shouting)
- (All screaming)
We can't get out here. Go out the window!
(Screaming)
You little shits!
Argh!
- My Lord!
- (Screaming)
(Micah) That is the funeral pyre
of those that have poisoned our world.
All the adults are gone!
You are one with us now.
There are no others to come between us.
Tonight, my brothers and sisters,
is harvest moon.
And the new harvest is ours,
as the sons and daughters
of the one true father -
He Who Walks Behind the Rows.
And tonight, he calls on us to serve him.
Danny, are you ready for the offering?
Yes.
Then say it, Danny.
Say that you are one with us!
We are one!
(All chanting) We are one!
We are one! We are one! We are one!
We are one! We are one!
We are one!
Give me your hand, Danny!
(All) We are one! We are one!
Lift your hand to
He Who Walks Behind the Rows.
We are one! We are one! We are one!
We are one! We are one!
We are one! We are one!
We are one! We are one! We are...
(Micah) Silence!
(All) We are one...
Danny! Danny, tell them to stop this!
Danny!
She is the first to be sacrificed!
Danny, get me out of here!
You little bastard!
First, cut out her tongue!
Then, when her pitiful
protestations are silenced,
carve out her heart!
For God sakes, Danny!
Each drop of their blood
shall nourish the seeds of new life!
Let the new harvest begin!
We are one! We are one!
(All) We are one! We are one!
We are one! We are one!
Danny, listen to me!
- We are one!
- Micah, stop it!
We are one!
Danny!
- It's the light from the corn.
- He's coming!
Now, Danny! He calls for it!
We are one! We are one!
We are one! We are one!
We are one! We are one!
- Danny, I love you. Please!
- Now, Danny!
(Screaming)
The party's over!
We are one! We are... Argh!
Kill the outlanders!
Danny, watch out!
Danny, get her out of there!
(Danny) Come on, let's go!
Frank! Frank, over here!
Ugh! Ugh!
No!
Right, come on. Come on!
Ruth, go! Go, go, go!
Get them, or we all shall
suffer the consequences
of He Who Walks Behind the Rows!
Go! Go!
Oh, what... what's going on?
We should've hit the road by now.
Something!
No, let's go this way.
Go! Go! Go!
This stuff doesn't end. It doesn't end!
That way.
(Screaming)
- Move!
- All right.
Hold it now. Hold it, just hold it. Let's go.
Take it easy. Take it easy now.
Watch it. Easy. Take it easy.
Did you really think
that He Who Walks Behind the Rows
would allow you to escape?
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Danny... you disappoint me.
Now you must be treated
just like the others.
- Stop this now.
- Silence!
- Argh!
- Hey!
Move it back!
The blood of those that defileth the corn
must flow into the earth!
Kneel!
Kneel!
Argh! Argh!
Argh!
(Screaming)
Argh!
- Argh!
- (Tractor engine starting)
Argh! Argh!
Argh! Argh!
Argh! Argh! Argh!
- Go! Go!
- OK!
Somebody help me!
Danny, please!
Come on! Danny, come on!
Please, Danny! You're my friend!
Danny, get the girls and get outta here!
(Micah) Danny, please!
- (Micah) I was there for you!
- I said get outta here now!
- (Micah) Please, Danny! You're my friend!
- Come on!
Argh!
(Roaring)
Argh!
(John) Keep going! Keep going!
(Screaming)
Ugh!
No! Come on! Come on!
So, um... did you really mean what you said?
I would've said anything
to get me out of that mess.
We'll talk about it. In New York.
(John) Let's go, Danny.
So what do we do about the children?
Tell their story. Let the healing begin.
It's not too late for that, is it?
No.
Maybe that incompetent editor
over at Newsweek will reconsider.
I mean, it's not everybody
who'll go through all this just for a story.
You're all right, Dad.
(Frank) This signifies
that the spirit will part the corn
and let through one
who finds truth within itself.
