We'll eatwith these.
Crystal!
Ah.
[Sighs ]
Now, fair Hippolyta,
ournuptial hourdraws on apace.
Fourhappy days
bring in anothermoon.
ButO, methinks, howslow
this old moon wanes!
She lingers my desires,
like to a stepdame ora dowager,
long withering out
a young man's revenue.
Fourdayswill quickly
steep themselves in night,
fournightswill quickly
dream awaythe time.
[ Laughs ]
And then the moon,
like to a silverbow
new-bentin heaven,
shall behold the night
of oursolemnities.
Happybe Theseus,
ourrenowned duke.
Thanks, good Egeus.
What's the newswith thee?
Full ofvexation come I,
with complaintagainstmy child,
my daughter Hermia.
Egeus:
Stand forth, Demetrius.
Mynoble lord,
this man hath
my consentto marryher.
Stand forth, Lysander.
This man hath bewitched
the bosom ofmy child.
Thou,thou, Lysander,
thou hast given herrhymes
and interchanged love tokens
with my child.
With cunning hastthou filched
my daughter's heart.
Turned herobedience,
which is due to me,
to stubborn harshness.
And, my gracious duke,
be itso she will not
here before your grace
consentto marry
with Demetrius.
I beg the ancient
privilege of Athens.
As she is mine,
I may dispose ofher,
and thatshall be either
to this gentleman...
orto herdeath,
according to ourlaw...
immediately provided
in thatcase.
Whatsayyou, Hermia?
Relent, sweet Hermia,
and, Lysander,yield
thy crazed title
to my certain right.
You have herfather's love,
Demetrius.
Letme have Hermia's.
Do you marryhim.
Cur. Cur!
Scornful Lysander,
true, he hath mylove,
and whatis mine
mylove shall renderhim.
And she is mine,
and all myrightofher
I do estate unto Demetrius.
I am, mylord,
aswell derived as he,
aswell possessed.
Mylove is more than his,
and which is more than
all these boasts can be,
I am beloved
ofbeauteous Hermia.
Whyshould not I
then prosecute myright?
Demetrius,
I'll avouch itto his head,
made love to
Nedar's daughter Helena
and won hersoul.
And she, sweetlady, dotes,
devoutly dotes,
dotes in idolatry,
upon this spotted
and inconstantman.
I mustconfess
I have heard so much.
I do entreatyour grace
to pardon me.
I knownotbywhatpower
I am made bold,
norhowitmay concern
mymodesty
in such a presence here
to plead mythoughts...
but I beseechyour grace
that I mayknow
the worstthatmay
befall me in this case.
Eitherto die the death,
orto abjure forever
the society ofmen.
And therefore, fair Hermia,
question yourdesires,
know ofyouryouth,
examine well yourblood,
whether, ifyouyield not
to yourfather's choice,
you can endure
the liveryof a nun,
foraye to be
in shady cloistermewed,
to live a barren sister
all yourlife,
chanting fainthymns
to the cold fruitless moon.
So will I grow...
so live, so die, mylord,
ere I will yield
myvirgin patentup
unto his lordship
whose unwished yoke
mysoul consents
notto give sovereignty.
Take time to pause.
Bythe nextnewmoon,
upon thatday
eitherprepare to die
fordisobedience
to yourfather'swill,
orelse to wed Demetrius,
as he would,
oron Diana's altarto protest
foraye austerity
and single life.
Foryou, fair Hermia,
look you arm yourself
to fityourfancies
to yourfather'swill.
Come, Hippolyta.
Demetrius, come.
And come, Egeus.
I have some private schooling
foryou both.
[Crying ]
Hownow, mylove?
Whyisyourcheek so pale?
How chance the roses there
do fade so fast?
Belike forwantofrain,
which I could well beteem them
from the tempestofmy eyes.
Aye me!
Foraught
that I could everread,
could everhear
bytale orhistory,
the course oftrue love
neverdid run smooth.
Ifthere were
a sympathyin choice,
war, death, orsickness
did laysiege to it,
making itmomentaryas a sound,
swiftas a shadow,
shortas any dream,
as brief as the lightning
in the collied night,
that, in a spleen,
unfolds both heaven and earth,
and ere a man hath power
to say'behold!'
the jaws ofdarkness
to devouritup.
So quick brightthings
come to confusion.
Therefore hearme, Hermia.
I have a widow aunt,
a dowagerof greatrevenue,
and she respects me
as heronlyson.
Helena: Demetrius!
Demetrius!
[ IndistinctConversation ]
Demetrius!
Ohh.
Demetrius!
Howhappysome
o'erothersome can be!
Through Athens I am thought
as fairas she.
Butwhatofthat?
Demetrius thinks notso.
He will notknowwhatall
buthe do know.
Love looks notwith the eyes,
butwith the mind,
and therefore iswinged Cupid
painted blind.
God speed, fair Helena.
Whitheraway?
Call you me fair?
That fairagain unsay.
Demetrius lovesyourfair.
O...happy fair!
Sickness is catching.
O,were favorso,
yourswould I catch,
fair Hermia, ere I go.
O,teach me howyou look,
and withwhatart
you swaythe motion
ofDemetrius' heart.
His folly, Helena,
is no faultofmine.
None butyourbeauty.
Would that faultwere mine!
Take comfort.
He no more shall see my face.
Lysanderand myself
shall flythis place.
Helen...
to you ourmindswe will unfold.
Tomorrownight,
when Phoebe doth behold
hersilvervisage
in the wateryglass,
a time thatlovers' flights
doth still conceal,
through Athens gates
have we devised to steal.
And thence from Athens
turn away oureyes
to seek new friends
and strangercompanies.
Egeus: Hermia!
Ohh.
Hermia!
Farewell, sweetplay fellow.
Praythou forus,
and good luck grantthee
thy Demetrius.
Egeus: Hermia!
Ohh.
Keep word, Lysander.
I will, my Hermia.
Helena, adieu.
Asyou on him,
Demetrius dote on you.
Oh...spite!
Oh, hell.

Bestto call them

according to the scrip.
[ Laughing ]
Come here, here.
Here is the scroll
of everyman's name
which is thought fit
through all ourtown
to playin ourinterlude
before the duke and duchess
on hiswedding day atnight.
But first,
good PeterQuince,

then read the names
ofthe actors,
and so growto a point.
Marry, ourplayis
The Most Lamentable Comedy
and Cruel Death
ofPyramus and Thisby.
Averygood piece ofwork,

Now, good PeterQuince,

bythe scroll.
Masters...
spread yourselves.
So, uh, answeras I call you.
Nick Bottom the weaver.
Ready.
Name whatpart I am for,
and proceed.
You, Nick Bottom,
are setdown for Pyramus.
Whatis Pyramus?
Aloverora tyrant?
He's a lover
thatkills himself,
most gallant, forlove.
All:Ahh.
Thatwill ask some tears
in the true performing ofit.
IfI do it, letthe audience
look to theireyes.
I will move storms.
I will condole in some measure.
Now,to the rest.
Quince:Well--
Yet, my chiefhumor
is fora tyrant.
I could play Ercles rarely,
ora partto teara catin,
to make all split.
Francis Flute--
The raging rocks
and shivering shocks
shall break the locks
ofprison gates,
and Phibbus' car
shall shine from far
and...make and mar
the foolish fates.
Ha ha ha.
Thiswas lofty. Ha ha.
Uh, ahem, Pyramus.
Uh, Francis Flute
the bellows-mender.
Here, PeterQuince.
Francis Flute,
you musttake Thisby on you.
Whatis Thisby?
Awandering knight?
He's the lady
that Pyramus mustlove.
[ Laughing ]
Nay, faith,
letnotme play a woman.
I have a beard coming.
And I mayhide my face,
letme playThisby,too.
Ohh--
I'll speak in
a monstrous little voice:
''Thisne,Thisne!''
Ah, Pyramus, myloverdear,
thyThisby dear, and lady dear!''
Ohh!
No, no,
you mustplay Pyramus.
Snout...
and Flute,you Thisby.
[Applause ]
Robin Starveling the tailor.
Here, PeterQuince.
Ah,well...
Snug the joiner,
youthe lion's part.
Ahh.
And I hope we have
a playwell fitted.
Have you
the lion's partwritten?
Prayyou, ifitbe,
give itme,
for I am slow ofstudy.
No,you may do itextempore,
foritis nothing butroaring.
Roar!
Roar!
Letme playthe lion,too.
I will roarthat I will do
anyman's heart good to hearme.
I will roarthat
I will make the duke say,
''Lethim roaragain.
Lethim roaragain!''
Butyou should do it
too terribly,
thatyouwould fright
the duchess and the ladies,
and theywould shriek.
And thatwere enough
to hang us all.
I grantyou, friends,
ifI should frightthe ladies
outoftheirwits,
theywould have no more
discretion butto hang us.
But I will aggravate myvoice
so that I will roaryou
as gently as anysucking dove;
I will roaryou
an 'twere anynightingale.
[Quietly Roaring ]
[ Laughing ]
[ Dog Barking ]
Aah--
[ Laughing ]
You can playno part
but Pyramus.
Pyramus is a sweet-faced man,
a properman as one shall see
in a summer's day,
a mostlovely gentlemanlike man.
Therefore you must
needs play Pyramus.
Well...
I will undertake it.
Masters,
you have all yourparts,
and I am to entreatyou
to con them bytomorrownight
and to meetin the palace wood,
a mile withoutthe town.
There will we rehearse.
Ifwe meetin the city,
we will be dogged by company
and ourdevices known.
Prayyou fail me not.
We will meet
and there we mayrehearse
mostobscenely
and courageously.
Take pains.
Be perfect.
Adieu.
[ Italian Operatic Singing ]
[Sighs ]
[Thunder ]
[Thunder ]
Ere Demetrius looked
on Hermia's eyne,
he hailed down oaths
thathe was onlymine.
And when this hail
some heat from Hermia felt,
so he dissolved,
and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him
offair Hermia's flight.
Then to the wood thisverynight
will he pursue her.
[Thunder ]
[ Pipes Playing ]
Getoff!.
Getoffthere!
Ah, fie!
Oh, sweetbeauty!
Hownow, spirit?
Whitherwanderyou?
Overhill, overdale,
through bush,
through a briar,
overpark, overpale,
through flood,through a fire,
I do wandereverywhere.
Swifterthan the moon's sphere.
And I serve the fairyqueen,
to dewherorbs upon the green.
Either I mistake yourshape
and making quite,
orelse you are thatshrewd
and knavish sprite
called Robin Goodfellow.
Are notyou he
that frights the maidens
ofthe villagery--
Psst!
Skims milk, and sometimes
labors in the quern
and bootless makes
the breathless housewife churn?
Are notyou he?
Thou speak'staright.
I am thatmerrywanderer
ofthe night.
Ijestto Oberon
and make him smile
when I a fatand
bean-fed horse beguile,
neighing in likeness
of a filly foal.
And sometimes...
Ugh!
Farewell,thou lob ofspirits.
I'll be gone.
The queen and all herelves
come here anon.
The king doth keep
his revels here tonight.
Take heed the queen come
notwithin his sight.
ForOberon
is passing fell
and wrath.
[ Urinating ]
- Hey!
-Go on.
Ill metbymoonlight,
proud Titania.
What,jealous Oberon!
Fairies, skip hence.
I have forsworn
his bed and company.
Tarry!
Rashwanton,
am not I thylord?
Then I mustbe thylady.
Why artthou here,
come from
the fartheststeppe ofIndia,
butthat, forsooth,
the bouncing Amazon,
yourbuskin'd mistress
and yourwarriorlove,
to Theseus mustbe wedded,
and you come to give theirbed
joy and prosperity.
How canstthouthus
forshame,Titania,
glance atmy credit
with Hippolyta,
knowing I know
thylove to Theseus?
These are the forgeries
ofjealousy.
And never, since
the middle summer's spring,
metwe on hill,
in dale, forest, ormead,
by paved fountain
orbyrushybrook,
butwith thybrawls
thou hastdisturbed oursport.
Therefore,the winds,
piping to us in vain,
as in revenge,
have sucked up from the sea
contagious fogs,
which, falling in the land,
hath everypelting river
made so proud
thattheyhave overborne
theircontinents.
And this same progeny
of evils comes
from ourdebate,
from ourdissension.
We are theirparents
and original.
Do you amend itthen?
Itlies in you.
Whyshould Titania
cross herOberon?
I do butbeg
a little changeling boy
to be myhenchman.
Setyourheartatrest.
The fairyland buys
notthe child ofme.
His motherwas
a votaress ofmy order,
and in the spiced Indian air,
bynight, full often
hath she gossiped bymyside
and satwith me
on Neptune'syellowsands,
marking the embarked traders
on the flood
when we have laughed
to see the sails conceive
and growbig-bellied
with the wanton wind.
Butshe, being mortal,
ofthatboy did die,
and forhersake
do I rearup herboy.
And forhersake
I will notpartwith him.
Howlong within thiswood
intend you stay?
Perchance till after
Theseus'wedding day.
Ifyouwill patiently
dance in ourround...
and see ourmoonlightrevels,
go with us.
Give me thatboy,
and I will go with thee.
Not forthy fairykingdom!
Fairies, away!
We shall chide downright
ifI longerstay.
Well, go thyway.
Thou shaltnot from this grove
till I tormentthee
forthis injury.
My gentle Puck, come hither.
Thou rememberest,
since once I sat
upon a promontory
and heard a mermaid
on a dolphin's back
uttering such dulcet
and harmonious breath
thatthe rude sea
grew civil athersong.
Thatverytime, I saw,
butthou couldstnot,
flying between the cold
moon and the Earth,
Cupid all armed.
Acertain aim he took
and loosed his love shaftsmartly
from his bow.
Yet, marked I where
the boltofCupid fell.
It fell upon
a little western flower,
before milk-white,
nowpurple with love'swound.
Fetch me that flower.
The juice ofit,
on sleeping eyelids laid,
will make all man, all woman
madly dote
upon the next live creature
thatitsees.
Fetch me this herb
and be thou here again
ere the leviathan
can swim a league.
I'll puta girdle
round aboutthe Earth
in 40 minutes.
Having once this juice,
I'll watch Titania
when she's asleep
and drop the liquorofit
in hereyes.
The next thing then
she waking looks upon...
she shall pursue it
with the soul oflove.
And ere I take this charm
from offhersight,
I'll make herrenderup
herpage to me.
I'll make herrenderup
herpage to me.
Demetrius: I love thee not,
therefore pursue me not!
Where is Lysanderand fair Hermia?
Thoutoldstme theywere
stolen unto thiswood,
and here am I,
and wode within thiswood,
because I cannotmeetmy Hermia!
Hence!
Getthee gone
and followme no more!
[ Honk Honk ]
[ Honk Honk ]
[Giggling ]
Do I entice you?
Do I speak you fair?
Orrather, do I not
in plainesttruth tell you
I do not,
nor I cannot, love you?
And even forthat
do I love youthe more.
I am yourspaniel.
And, Demetrius,
the more you beatme,
I will fawn on you.
Use me butasyourspaniel.
Spurn me, strike me,
neglectme, lose me,
but give me leave,
unworthy as I am,
to followyou.
Whatworserplace
can I beg in yourlove
than to be used
asyou use yourdog?
Temptnottoo much
the hatred ofmyspirit,
for I am sick
when I do look on thee.
And I am sick
when I look noton you!
Do...
impeachyourmodesty
too much
to leave the city
and commityourself
into the hands of one
thatlovesyou not?
To trustthe opportunity
ofnight...
and the ill counsel
of a desertplace
with the richworth
ofyourvirginity?
Yourvirtue
is my privilege.
Forthat
itis notnight
when I do see yourface.
Therefore I think
I am notin the night.
Nordoth thiswood
lack worlds of company,
foryou in myrespect
are all the world.
I'll run from thee
and hide me in the brakes
and leave thee to
the mercy ofwild beasts!
The wildesthath not
such a heartasyou.
Run when youwill,
the storyshall be changed.
Apollo flies,
and Daphne holds the chase.
The dove pursues the griffin.
I will notstaythy questions!
Letme go!
Orifthou followme,
do notbelieve
but I shall do thee
mischiefin the wood!
Aye, in the temple,
in the town, in the field,
you do me mischief--oh!
Fie, Demetrius!
Yourwrongs do set
a scandal on mysex!
Oh!
We cannot fight forlove
as men may do.
We should be wooed
and were notmade to woo.
I'll followthee
and make a heaven ofhell
to die upon the hand
I love so well.
Fare thee well, nymph.
Ere he shall leave this grove,
thou shalt flyhim,
and he shall seek thylove.
Hastthouthe flowerthere?
Ahh...
I know a bank where
the wild thyme blows,
where oxlips and
the nodding violet grows,
quite overcanopied
with the lusciouswoodbine,
with sweetmusk-roses
and with eglantine.
There sleeps Titania
sometime ofthe night.
Lulled in these flowers
with dances and delight.
And there the snake
throws herenameled skin,
weed wide enough
to wrap a fairyin.
With the juice ofthis
I'll streak hereyes
and make herfull
ofhateful fantasies.
Take thou some ofit
and seek through this grove.

with a disdainful youth.

Well, find you outa bed...

Oh,take the sense,
sweet, ofmyinnocence.
I mean...
thatmyheartunto yours is knit

I do notlie.

And then end life

and silence.
Butwho is here?

This is he, mymastersaid,

[ Honk ]
And there the maiden,
sleeping sound
on the dank and dirty ground.
Prettysoul.
She durstnotlie
with this lack-love,
this kill-courtesy.
Churl,
upon thy eyes I throw
all the power
this charm doth owe.
When thouwakest,
letlove forbid

And so awake when I am gone,
for I mustnow...
to Oberon!
[ Honks Horn ]
I charge thee hence,
and do nothauntme thus.
Oh,wiltthou darkling leave me?
Do notso.
Stay on thy peril.
I alone will go.
[ Breathing Hard ]
I am outofbreath
in this fond chase.
The more my prayer,
the lesseris my grace.
Happyis Hermia,
wheresoe'ershe lies,
forshe hath blessed
and attractive eyes.
How came hereyes so bright?
Notwith salttears.
Ifso, my eyes are oftener
washed than hers.
No.
No, no.
No.
I am as...ugly...
as a bear.
Forbeasts thatmeetme

Oh.
And run through fire
I will forthysweetsake.
Where is Demetrius?
Oh, how fita word
is thatvile name
to perish on mysword.
Do notsayso, Lysander.
Saynotso.
What?
Though he love your Hermia?
Lord,whatthough?
Yet Hermia still lovesyou,
then be content.
Contentwith Hermia?
No. I do repent
the tedious minutes
I with herhave spent.
Not Hermia, but Helena I love.
Who will notchange
a raven fora dove?
Wherefore was I
to this keen mockeryborn?
When atyourhands
did I deserve such scorn?
Is'tnotenough,
is'tnotenough,young man,
that I did never,
no, nornevercan,
deserve a sweetlook
from Demetrius' eye
butyou must flout
myinsufficiency?
Oh, but fare youwell.
Perforce I mustconfess,
I thoughtyou lord
ofmore true gentleness.
She sees not Hermia.
Hermia, sleeps thouthere,
and nevermaystthou come

And, all my powers,
addressyourlove and might
to honor Helen
and to be herknight!
[Sighs ]
Aye, me.
Forpity,
whata dream was here.
Ohh.

with fear.

[Men Singing ]
Here's a marvelous,
convenientplace
forourrehearsal.
This green plot
shall be ourstage,
this hawthorn brake

and we will, uh,
do itin action
aswe will do it
before the duke.
PeterQuince.
Whatsayestthou,
bully Bottom?
There are things in this
Comedy ofPyramus and...
Thisby.
Thisbythatwill neverplease.
First, Pyramus mustdraw a sword
to kill himself
which the ladies cannotabide.
By ourlady, a parlous fear.
I believe we must
leave the killing out
when all is done.
Nota whit.
I have a device to make all well.
Write me a prologue,
and letthe prologue seem to say
we will do no harm
with ourswords
and that Pyramus is not
killed indeed,
and forthe more betterassurance
tell them that I, Pyramus,
am not Pyramus,
but Bottom the weaver.
Thiswill putthem outoffear.
Oh,well,we will have
such a prologue,
and itshall be written
in, uh, 8 and 6.
No, make it2 more.
Letitbe written
in 8 and 8.
Butthere is 2 hard things:
Thatis to bring
the moonlightinto a chamber,
for,you know, Pyramus
and Thisbymeetbymoonlight.
Doth the moon shine
thatnightwe play ourplay?
Acalendar.Acalendar!
Calendar.
Look in the almanac.
Find outifthe moon shine.
Find outmoon shine.
Itdoth shine thatnight.
Itdoth shine thatnight.
Why,then mayyou leave
a casement
ofthe greatchamberwindow
open where we play,
and the moon mayshine in
atthe casement.
Two hard things.
We musthave a wall
in the greatchamber,
for Pyramus and Thisby,
says the story,
did talk through
the chink of a wall.
You can neverbring in a wall.
Whatsayyou, Bottom?
Some man
orothermustpresentwall.
Uh, Sam. Sam.
And lethim have some plaster
orsome loam orsome

And lethim hold his fingers thus,
and through thatcranny

You can neverbring in a wall.
No, no, no.
A-And ifthis maybe,
then all iswell.
Quince: Pyramus,you begin,
and when you have
spoken yourspeech,
enterinto thatbrake.
Thisby, stand forth.
Now, left foot forward
and then antique gesture.
Uh, Pyramus, speak.
Whathempen homespuns

Oh. Ooh.

Bless thee, Bottom.

Thou arttranslated.
Aah.

Why do theyrun away?
I see theirknavery.
This is to make an ass ofme,

And I will sing

*The plain-song cuckoo gray *
* Whose note so many

* And dares notanswernay *
[ Brays ]
I praythee, gentle mortal,
sing again.
Mine earis much enamored
ofthynote.
So is mine eye
enthralled to thyshape,
and thy fairvirtues
force, perforce,
doth move me, on the firstview,
to say...to swear,
I love thee.
M-M-Methinks, mistress,
you should have
little reason forthat,
and yet,
to saythe truth,
reason and love keep little
companytogethernowadays.

Nay, I can gleek,

Thou artaswise

Notso, neither.

Hop in hiswalks

Buthastthouyetlatched
the Athenian's eyes
with the love-juice,
as I did bid thee do?
I took him sleeping.
Thatis finished,too.
Demetrius: ...so bitter...
Stand close.
Now I butchide.
But I should use thee worse,
forthou, I fear,
has given me cause to curse.
Ifthou hastslain Lysander
in his sleep,
being o'ershoes in blood,
plunge in the deep,
and kill me,too.
This is the same Athenian.
This is the woman...
Uh-huh.
Butnotthis the man.
Hermia:The sun was not
so true unto the day
as he to me.
Would he have stolen away
from sleeping Hermia?
Where is he?
Good Demetrius,
wiltthou give him me?
I had rather give
his carcass to myhounds.
Ohh. Out, dog.
Out, cur.
Thou drivestme pastthe bounds
ofmaiden's patience.
And hastthou killed him
while sleeping?
Oh, brave touch.
Could nota worm,
an adder, do so much?
You spend yourpassion
on a misprised mood.
I am not guilty
ofLysander's blood,
noris he dead,
forall that I can tell.
I praythee,tell me,
then,thathe iswell.
And ifI could,
whatshould I gettherefore?
Aprivilege
neverto see me more.
There's no following her
in this fierce vein.
Here,therefore, fora while,
I will remain.
Whathastthou done?
Thou hastmistaken quite
and laid the love-juice
on some true love's sight.
Aboutthe woods,
go swifterthan the wind,
and Helena of Athens
look thou find.
Bysome illusion
look thou bring herhere.
I'll charm his eyes
againsthe do appear.
I go, I go! Look how I go!
Swifterthan arrow
from the tartar's bow.
The moon methinks
lookswith herwateryeye,
and when she weeps,
weeps everylittle flower,
lamenting some
enforced chastity.

Captain of ourfairyband,
Helena is here athand,
and the youth, mistook byme,
pleading fora lover's fee.
Shall we theirfond pageantsee?
Lord,what fools these mortals be.
Whyshould youthink
that I should woo in scorn?
Scorn and derision
nevercome in tears.
Look.
When I vow, I weep,
and vows so born,
in theirnativity
all truth appears.
How can these things in me
seem scorn to you,
bearing the badge offaith
to prove them true?
You do advance yourcunning
more and more.
When truth kills truth,
O devilish-holy fray.
These vows are Hermia's.
Will you give hero'er?
Weigh oathwith oath,
and youwill nothing weigh.
I had no judgment
when to her I swore.
Nornone, in mymind,
nowyou give hero'er.
Demetrius loves her,
and he loves notyou.
Helen...
goddess...
nymph...
perfect...
divine.
To what, mylove,
shall I compare thine eyne?
Crystal is muddy.
Oh, howripe in showthylips,
those kissing cherries,
tempting grow.
Oh.
Helen.
Oh, spite.
Oh, hell.
I see you all are bent
to setagainstme
foryourmerriment.
Can you nothate me,
as I knowyou do,
butyou must join in souls
to mock me,too?
Demetrius: Helen.
Helen, it's notso.
Helen!
[Grunting ]
Oh, Lysander.
Lysander?
Love!
Oh,whyunkindly
didstthou leave me so?
Whyshould he stay
whom love doth press to go?
Whatlove could press
Lysanderfrom myside?
Lysander's love,
thatwould notlethim bide.
Whyseekestthou me?
Could notthis make thee know
the hate I bearthee
made me leave thee so.
You speak notasyouthink.
Itcannotbe.
Lo, she is one
ofthis confederacy.
Injurious Hermia.
Mostungrateful maid.
Have you conspired?
Have you,with--with these,
contrived to baitme
with this foul derision?
Is all the counsel
thatwe two have shared,
the sister'svows,
the hours thatwe have spent
when we have chid
the hasty-footed time
forparting us--
Oh, is all forgot?
And will you rent
ourancientlove asunder
to join with men
in scorning yourpoorfriend?
Itis not friendly,
'tis notmaidenly.
Oursex, aswell as I,
may chide you forit,
though I alone do feel the injury.
I understand not
whatyou mean bythis.
Aye, do.
Persever, counterfeitsad looks,
make mouths upon me
when I turn myback.
Ifyou have any pity,
grace, ormanners,
youwould notmake me
such an argument,
but fare youwell.
'Tis partlymy own fault,
which death orabsence
soon shall remedy.
Helena, I love thee.
Bymylife, I do.
Oh, excellent.
I say I love thee
more than he can do.
Hermia:
Lysander, do you not jest?
Yes, sooth, and so do you.
Ow!
Am not I Hermia?
I am as fairnow
as I was erewhile.
Whythen you leftme
in earnest, shall I say?
And neverdid desire
to see thee more.
Be certain, nothing truer,
'tis no jestthat I hate thee
and love Helena.
Oh, me.
You juggler!
You cankerblossom!
Youthief oflove.
What, have you come bynight
and stolen mylove's
heart from him?
Oh, fine, in faith.
Have you no modesty,
no maiden shame,
no touch ofbashfulness?
What? Will youtear
impatientanswers
from my gentle tongue? Fie!
Fie,you counterfeit,
you puppetyou!
Puppet?
Whyso?
Aye,thatway goes the game.
Now I perceive thatshe hath
made compare
between ourstatures.
She hath urged herheight,
and with herpersonage,
hertall personage,
herheight, forsooth,
she hath prevailed with him.
And are you grown so...
high in his esteem
because I am so dwarfish
and so low?
Well, howlow am I,
thou painted maypole?
Speak.
Howlow am I?
I'm notyetso low
butthatmynails
can reach into thine eyes.
-Aah!
- Rrr!
[Screaming ]
Oh, I prayyou,though
you mock me, gentlemen,
do notletherhurtme.
You perhaps maythink
because she is somewhat
lowerthan myself,
that I can match her!
Lower?! Hark again!
Good Hermia, do notbe
so bitterwith me.
And now, so youwill
letme quiet go,
to Athenswill
I bearmy follyback
and followyou no further.
Letme go.You see how
simple and how fond I am.
Why, getyou gone.
Who is'tthathindersyou?
Helena:Afoolish heart
that I do leave here behind.
What,with Lysander?
With Demetrius!
Be notafraid.
She shall notharm thee, Helena!
No, sir! She shall not,
thoughyoutake herpart.
She was a vixen
when she wentto school,
and though she be butlittle...
Little?
She is fierce.
Little? Little again?
Nothing butlow and little?
Whywill you sufferher
to floutme thus?
Letme come to her!
Getyou home,you dwarf,
you minimus
ofhindering knot-grass made,
you bead,you acorn.
Nowshe holds me not.
Now followifthou darest,
to trywhose right.
Ofthine ormine,

Follow?
Nay, I'll go with thee,
cheek by jowl.
You, mistress...
all this coil is 'long ofyou.
Nay, go notback.
Oh...
I will nottrustyou, I,
norlongerstay

Yourhands than mine

Mylegs are longerthough,
to run away!
Ohh! Ohh!
I am amazed
and knownotwhatto say.
Ohh!
This is thynegligence.
Still, still, still!
Thou mistakest. Orelse...
committ'stthyknaveries
willfully, hmm?
Believe me, king ofshadows,
I mistook.
Did notyoutell me
I would knowthe man
bythe Athenian garments
thathe had on?
Thou see'stthese lovers
seek a place to fight.
Hie therefore, Robin,

as black as acheron,
and lead these testyrivals
so astray

Whiles I in this affair
do thee employ,
I'll to my queen...
and beg her Indian boy.
And then I will hercharmed eye
release from monster'sview...
and all things shall be peace.
Up and down, up and down,
I will lead them up and down.
I am fear'd in field and town.
Goblin, lead them up and down.
Ah, ha ha ha ha!
-Ah, here comes one.
- [ Honks Horn ]
Where artthou, proud Demetrius?
Demetrius:
Here,villain! Where artthou?
I'll be with thee straight.
Lysander! Speak again!
Thou runaway! Thou coward!
Artthou fled?
Come, recreant.
Come,thou child.
Yea! Artthouthere?
Followmyvoice.
We'll tryno manhood here.
Oh,the villain
is much lighter-heeled than I.
I follow'd fast,
but fasterhe did fly.
Then fallen am I
in dark uneven way,
and here will restme.
O come,thou gentle day.
Come hither! I am here!
[ Honk Honk ]
Nay,then.Thou mock'stme?
Thou shaltbuythis dear
if ever I thy face
by daylightsee!
Now go thyway.
Faintness constraineth me
to measure outmylength
on this cold bed.
By day's approach...
look to be visited.
Neverso weary...
neverso in woe.
I can no furthercrawl,
no further go.
Here I will restme
till the break ofday.
Heavens shield Lysander,
iftheymean a fray.
Helena: O wearynight...
O long and tedious night,
abate thyhours,
shine comforts from the east
that I mayback to Athens
by daylight,
from these that
my poorcompany detest.
And sleep,thatsometimes
shuts up sorrow's eye,
steal me awhile
from mine own...company.
Titania:
Come, sitthee down
upon this flowerybed,
while I thy
amiable cheeks do coy,
and stick musk-roses
in thysleek, smooth head,
and kiss thy fairlarge ears,
my gentle joy.
Hmm. I mustto the barber's.
Methinks I'm marvelous hairy
aboutthe face,
and I am such a tenderass.
Ifmyhairdo buttickle me,
I mustscratch.
What,wiltthou hearsome music,
mysweetlove?
Orsay, sweetlove,
whatthou desirestto eat.
Truly, a peck ofprovender.
I could munch
your good dryoats.
Methinks I have a greatdesire
to a bottle ofhay.
Good hay, sweethay,

But, I prayyou,
letnone ofyourpeople stirme.
I have an exposition ofsleep
come upon me.
Sleep thou, and I will
wind thee in my arms.
Fairies, begone,
and be all ways away.
So doth the woodbine,

Oh, how I love thee!
How I dote on thee!

[Gasps ]
Oh, my Oberon.
Oh,whatvisions have I seen.
Methought I was enamored
of an ass.
There liesyourlove.
[Gasps ]
How came these things to pass?
Silence a while.
Fairyking, attend and mark,
I do hearthe morning lark.
Then, my queen, in silence sad,
trip we afternight's shade.
We the globe can compass soon,
swifterthan the wandering moon.
Come, mylord, and in ourflight,
Tell me howitcame this night
that I sleeping here was found
with these mortals
on the ground.
We will, fairqueen,
up to the mountain's top,
and mark the musical confusion
ofhounds and echo
in conjunction.
Myhounds are bred out
ofthe spartan kind,
so flew'd, so sanded,
and theirheads are hung--
With ears.
[ Riders Shouting ]
Butsoft.
Whatnymphs are these?
Mylord,this is
my daughterhere asleep.
And this, Lysander.
This, Demetrius is.
This, Helena.
Old Nedar's Helena.
I wonderofthem
being here together.
No doubttheyrose up early
to observe the rite ofMay.
Good morrow, friends.
Saint Valentine is past.
Begin these wood-birds
butto couple now?
I prayyou all, stand up.
I knowyoutwo are rival enemies.
How comes this gentle concord
in the world,
thathatred is
so farfrom jealousy,
to sleep byhate
and fearno enmity?
Mylord,
I shall reply amazedly,
halfsleep, halfwaking...
Butas I think--
fortrulywould I speak--
I came with Hermia hither.
Ourintentwas to
be gone from Athens
where we might
withoutthe peril
-ofthe Athenian law--
- Enough!
Mylord,
you have heard enough.
I beg the law--
the law, upon his head.
Theywould have stolen away.
Theywould, Demetrius,thereby
to have defeated you and me--
you ofyourwife,
and me ofmy consent,
ofmy consentthat
she should be yourwife.
My good lord,
I wotnotbywhatpower,
butbysome poweritis,
mylove to Hermia
melted as the snow,
and all the faith,
the virtue ofmyheart,
the objectand the pleasure
ofmine eye
is only Helena.
Fairlovers...
you are fortunatelymet.
Egeus,
I will overbearyourwill,
forin the temple
by and bywith us
these couples shall
eternallybe knit.
Awaywith us to Athens,
three and three.
We'll hold a feast
in greatsolemnity!
Come, Hippolyta.
When my cue comes, call me,
and I will answer.
Mynext is
''Most fair Pyramus...''
Heigh-ho.
PeterQuince?
Flute!
Snoutthe tinker!
Starveling!
God's mylife, stolen hence,
and leftme asleep!
I have had a mostrare vision.
I have had a dream...
pastthe witofman to say
whatdream itwas--
Man is butan ass
ifhe go about
to expound this dream.
Methought I was...
There is no man can tell what.
Methought I was...
Methought I had...
Butman is buta patched fool
ifhe will offerto say
whatmethought I had.
The eye ofman hath notheard.
The earofman hath notseen.
Man's hand
is notable to taste,
his tongue to conceive,
norhis heartto report
whatmy dream was.
I will get PeterQuince
to write a ballad ofthis dream.
Itshall be called
Bottom's...
Dream...
because ithath no bottom.
And I will sing it
in the latterend of a play
before the duke.
Peradventure,to make it
the more gracious,
I shall sing itatherdeath.
Have you sentto Bottom's house?
Has he come home yet?
He cannotbe heard of.
Outofdoubt,
he is transported.
Ifhe come not,
then the playis marred.
It goes not forward,
doth it?
Masters!
The duke is coming
from the temple,
and there's two orthree
lords and ladies more married.
If oursporthad gone forward,
we had all been made men.
O sweetbully Bottom!
Thus hath he lostsixpence
a day during his life.
Had the duke had not
given him sixpence
forplaying Pyramus,
I'll be hanged.
He would've deserved it.
Sixpence a dayin Pyramus,
ornothing.

[Operatic Tenor

Rrahhrr!
If itplease you.
These things seem small
and indistinguishable,
like far-offmountains
turning into clouds.
And I have found my Demetrius
like a jewel mine own,
and notmine own.
Oh.
'Tis strange, myTheseus,
thatthese lovers speak of.
More strange than true.
I nevermaybelieve
these antique fables,
northese fairytoys.
Lovers and madmen
have such seething brains,
such shaping fantasies
thatapprehend more
than coolerreason
evercomprehends.
Such tricks hath
strong imagination,
thatifitwould
butapprehend some joy,
itcomprehends
some bringerofthe joy.
Butall the story
ofthe nighttold over,
and all theirminds
transfigured so together,
more witnesseth
than fancyimages
and grows to something
of greatconstancy,
but, howsoever,
strange and admirable.

Here, mightyTheseus.
Whatrevels are in hand?
Is there no play
to ease the anguish
of a torturing hour?
There is a briefhow
manysports are ripe.
''Battle with thecentaurs,
to be sung by an Athenian
eunuch to the harp.''
We'll none ofthat.
''The riot ofthetipsybacchanals,
tearing the Thraciansinger
intheirrage.''
Thatis an old device,
and itwas played
when I from Thebes
came lasta conqueror.
''Thethricethree muses
mourning for
thedeathoflearning,
latedeceased in beggary.''
Thatis some satire,
keen and critical,
notsorting with
a nuptial ceremony.
''Atedious briefscene
ofyoung Pyramus
and his love Thisby.
Verytragical mirth.''
Merry and tragical?
Tedious and brief?
Thatis hotice
and wondrous strange snow.
Whatare theythatdo playit?
Hard-handed men
thatwork in Athens here,
which neverlabored

and nowhave toiled

with this same play

We will hearit.
No, no, mylord.
I did hearitover,

No, in truth, sire,
