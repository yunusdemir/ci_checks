Yumi, calm down.
If you panic, you'll hyperventilate.
You are doing better than expected.
Please...
I'm getting tired of this.
Please.
Help me...
Please.
Never tried this before.
Well, the cameras are all recording.
Impressive.
After all we've been through,
you're still fighting.
Do you want a second chance?
On second thought...
Let's just finish this.
Cut.
Mr. Bayu, I am Novi, the assigned reporter.
Oh, yes. Bayu.
Could you set up the camera?
Thank you.
I've read your report on Dharma.
It was sound.
Too bad you never completed it.
Friends from the media,
there's nothing to report.
Any opinion on the domestic abuse case
you're facing now?
Just hold on right there.
Please ignore this nonsense.
There's no problem here.
We're not talking about those issues.
Those vile allegations were made
by my client's enemies
in an effort to bring him down.
How about the allegations...
Those are private matters!
Why all the sordid questions?
Her bruises are complications
from cosmetic surgery.
It's not the first time for her, right?
Nothing unusual here.
Mr. Dharma loves his wife,
nothing has changed between them.
I repeat, Mr. Dharma loves her.
Let's keep things low-profile
for the next few weeks.
This incident might cause repercussions.
Your enemies from the other side
will use this as a...
Robert!
You handled those reporters extremely well.
But I don't like what you just said.
Sounds like you're addressing
a weak old man.
I am offended.
What I really mean is...
What the hell is taking so long?
Mamad, let's go!
OK, I'm sorry, really sorry.
In that case, let's change our strategy.
Move aside, asshole!
Enough!
Interview's over, put the camera away!
What do you want now?
Move your car now!
I want to see Mr. Dharma.
Mind your own business
What's gotten into you, boy?
Don't you remember me?
Pesky journalist.
How are things?
How's your career now?
I'll never forget what you did.
You tried to smear me.
And you failed.
All for nothing.
Too ambitious.
Out of the way!
Stop it!
Try not to hold it too tight.
OK, now you swing as wide.
Swing hard straight down.
Forgive me.
Just stay here.
Why?
I'm really sorry.
You idiots!
Sorry.
Soichi, sorry.
<i>For the umpteenth time, Dharma
got away with the charges against him.</i>

Dad!
Hey, love.
Let's go, Dad. Mom's waiting.
What are you working on?
I heard screaming from your computer, Dad.
Always the nosy little girl, aren't you?
You and your excuses, Dad!
Dad, when are you moving back home?
Your mom and I need more time, Elly.
- Elly's asleep?
- She is.
Always loved these.
You taught me well.
You remember this one?
You were happy back then.
Always a serious man, though.
But you were happy.
I messed things up, didn't I?
We both did.
You're still here, Dad?
Why aren't you sleeping, honey?
Let me change her clothes.
Bayu?
Bayu?
Oh, excuse me. Welcome!
I'm looking for white roses.
Sorry, sir, we're sold out.
I see.
Would you be interested
in something else, perhaps?
Sure.
Is it for someone special?
Just for myself.
Something to liven up my room.
I see.
How about these?
Easter lilies.
Very calming. They might be just right.
Move, you brats! Show me your hands!
Spread them apart.
Who did this?
You little monsters!
I'm asking who did this!
I'm sorry, sir.
You little brat!
Don't think you can just apologise.
Where do you live?
You must've done this before!
- Damn it.
- What happened?
That old fart's on our case!
Why, you little...
Who the hell are you?
Yes. Thank you very much!
I'll take a bunch of these then.
Oh, all right.
This is a really nice shop.
Not really.
It's tough running a business.
You're the first customer today.
Then let me take two bunches.
It'd be as if you'd had two customers.
Thank you very much.
My name is Hisae Kawahara.
I'm Nomura.
Mr. Nomura.
What did you say to that old man?
I told him I'd memorized his license plate
and I'll find him, cut him into pieces,
and stuff him into the trunk of his car.
That's all.
Why are we stopping?
Sir?
Driver, why did you stop?
Where are we?
What the...
Now, just wait.
Your wallet and phone, hand them over.
I'm not carrying a lot here, believe me.
I see.
Trying to fuck us over?
Not gonna happen.
That's all I've got.
That's what you want, right?
Just let me go.
Is this your daughter?
She's cute.
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Shut it!
Don't fight it, bro.
It's Jakarta after all, bro!
So you're a daddy, huh?
- I like your daughter!
- Stop it!
She's very cute!
Any age will do, eh?
Keep still!
Keep still!
Stop that, you bastard!
I said fuckin' stop!
Hold him!
Fuck!
Stop it! Now!
Kill him, fucker!
Fucked
You bastard!
I'm gonna kill you, you bastard!
Mr. Nomura.
<i>Are you listening?</i>
Of course I am.
You quit, right?
Yeah, I'm thinking of
going to catering college.
Your parents are OK with it?
I haven't told them about it.
Living in Tokyo alone is very hard.
I'll be fine. I'll do my best.
Then good luck.
Nomura...
I don't usually go out
with someone I've just met.
Neither do I.
Liar!
Please, why are you doing this?
Why...
<i>Police are ruling out robbery.</i>
<i>However they are looking into
possible connections</i>
<i>with other murders
posted to online video sites.</i>
- Elly?
- Yes, Dad?
I thought it was just going to be
the three of us?
There's Grandma and Grandpa.
And that's Jon.
Who?
Jon, he's Mom's friend.
He hangs out with Grandpa.
Let's go, Dad.
What have you done to your face?
Forget it. Don't answer.
Elly, look at the mess you're making!
That's why she needs a father figure!
She doesn't need fussing over.
Just a regular firm-handed male figure.
That usually leads to domestic abuse.
What's his name, Dina?
He's all over the news.
No idea, Mom.
Dharma?
He's a powerful guy for sure.
People make too much of him.
Dharma's a self-made man.
He's all discipline and ambition.
Dad, everyone knows he's a crook.
Any proof?
Listen, innocent until proven otherwise.
Am I right, Bayu?
Regarding his corruption or...
Bayu, you will never understand.
Your stories on him? Remember?
All for nothing.
Dad! Please.
I mean, look at you now.
Dad, enough!
Jon, tell us your good news.
It's really nothing, sir.
Dina,
Jon scooped some major investors.
Major merger.
So, I took your dad to meet my clients.
Turns out they are your dad's friends.
And it seems...
<i>Bayu! Bayu!</i>
What's your job now?
<i>Bayu, I'm really sorry.</i>
<i>Dad didn't have the right to do that.</i>
<i>I hope you're OK.</i>
<i>Please, miss.</i>
<i>The case is closed.</i>
<i>Mr. Dharma has been proven innocent.
End of story!</i>
Good evening.
Hope you like this...
Thank you!
Don't point your gun at me, OK?
This is cool.
<i>I'm sorry, I should not have...</i>
A game console...
A yoyo is enough for my brother.
I shouldn't spoil him too much.
But thank you for your kindness.
That's all right.
Soichi has a type of autism.
He only has me to rely on.
Father sends us some money every month.
Far from enough...
All we have is each other.
What about you?
What?
Tell me about yourself.
It's really hard to describe myself.
How come?
Sister...
My sister, I loved her very much.
An accident happened to her
when I was in junior high school.
<i>After that, my parents died in a fire.</i>
I covered my university expenses
with their life insurance.
After graduation, I worked in America...
Until the Lehman bankruptcy.
And I'm back here now.
Look at me, rambling on...
Nomura...
It will be OK.
Things will get better.
Loneliness...
It leaves deep wounds.
Have you ever wondered
if it would just be easier to die?
What do you mean?
About your brother, Soichi.
Death might be an easier
way for him, right?
Excuse me.
Hisae!
Nomura, please leave now.
Who the fuck?
Don't move.
You tryin' to rob me?
Come here! Come here!
You bastard!
Just relax, what do you want?
Let me goddamn think!
You want money, right?
Just don't harm me.
Murder's a big deal.
Life imprisonment, you know?
I know you don't want this.
Where are you going? No one's there!
Mister, please.
Please, sir. I want to go home.
How should I know?
Hurry up, give me that damn money!
Hurry up!
OK, shit!
That's it?
Fuck off, Ahmad! Get off my case!
What are you doing?
Now we're talking!
Oh, wow.
Cool!
I'm all yours now.
Your name?
Call me Midori.
Midori, why don't we go to my place?
Sounds good.
Do you want to fuck me?
What if I say no?
What do you want to do?
First, I'm going to make you bleed.
Wow, that hard?
It'll be the night of your life.
I'll split you in half.
I can't wait.
Get ready.
You can do whatever you want.
Sister?
Ow! What the fuck are you doing?
Sorry.
Fucking idiot!
You nearly killed me!
Money don't mean shit if I die!
Fuck, it's bleeding.
What are you gonna do now?
We're in the middle of the road.
You'd better drive me back.
Just wait.
- I said go back, now! Hurry up!
- OK, OK...
Turns out you're worse than Dharma.
Sick bastards.
You're that journalist.
Now you remember me.
Talk to me.
What do you want?
Dharma.
Dharma.
He's in his hotel.
Star Hotel.
<i>His schedules, access card...</i>
<i>You'll find them in the drawer.</i>
Hey, come here.
Closer, please.
You have a daughter, right?
I also have a little girl.
One father to another...
Please have mercy.
Had it been your child
raped and tortured...
What would you have done then?
I said stop here, goddamn it!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You really hurt my face!
Wait there!
<i>Hello, Nomura? I need talk to you.</i>
Sorry, about that time...
I can't talk now...
I'll call you back later.
<i>Nomura? What's going on?</i>
Get out, you fucking bastard!
I'll pay. It was an accident.
You ruined my merchandise!
Enough, Ahmad!
- You'll kill him!
- Shut up!
It's not enough.
You deserved it, you bastard!
You won't get away with it.
Shuhei Nomura.
Hey.
What's going on?
You see, my daughter...
She asked, "Daddy, will it hurt?"
I said, "Yes, it will."
She always hated pain.
After I killed everyone...
Suddenly I felt cold and scared as hell.
But then a wave of calm hit me.
What the hell, old man?
You fool.
Is there a point to seeing life
as something precious?
Life is hell any way you look at it.
Oh, game over!
- Elly?
- Let's try again.
Elly!
Hi, Dad! Come and join us.
How's it going, buddy?
Elly...
Oh, Bayu. Why are you here?
You should've told me you were coming.
OK.
Do I need permission to see my daughter?
Take it easy, will you?
That's not what I...
It should've been me out there with her.
Should've been me.
You want to go out with this guy now?
But you did all that.
Right? So, what's the problem, Bayu?
Jon is a nice person.
He's just like the rest.
You're trying to take Elly
away from me, right?
Watch what you're saying!
You walked out of this house! Not me!
Don't take your anger out on me.
This is my home. You
should've called first!
What's wrong with you?
So, I'm the bad guy here?
Jon, it's not...
ls there any problem?
Where the fuck did you crawl out of?
Relax, Bayu.
Elly's just out there.
You shouldn't be doing this.
Get a grip.
Relax.
What?
I said, get a grip.
The fuck you know about my family?
Who are you?
Think you can fuck my family?
Bayu. Stop it!
Stop it!
Get out!
I said get out!
Please stop. Give it to me...
Soichi! Jump in.
What happened to your face?
School can be tough, huh?
This is better than your games.
Do you know what this is?
Careful!
Don't point it at yourself.
Point it at the other person.
Push the button.
This one?
Do they always bully you?
Do you fight back?
Aren't you afraid?
They make fun of my sister!
Then hurt them back.
Hurt them again and again.
Till they die!
Huh?
I'll beat them to death.
I see. So, do you want to kill them?
Soichi, you love your sister, right?
Yes!
Then we are the same.
I loved my sister as well.
How about the others?
You're all alone.
Everyone is a liar!
Listen carefully, Soichi...
The strong person gets what he wants.
The weak person gets everything taken away.
Even their most loved ones.
Get everything I want.
Soichi.
Why don't you go and try your new toy?
Hisae
<i>This is Hisae. Can I talk
to you about Soichi?</i>
Yeah.
<i>He's been acting strangely
these last few days.</i>
Yes.
<i>He mentioned you, so I
thought I should call.</i>
<i>Can I come by your place?</i>
Hisae, you should stay away from me.
<i>But...</i>
There's nothing to talk about.
<i>I see.</i>
Sorry, I have to go now.
Yeah, yeah, right. What?
Sorry, what was that?
Yes, yes, yes.
All right, I'll see you at the club then.
Let's go, girls.
OK, girls, time to work!
Thank you, sir.
- Just put the rest on my tab.
- Thank you, sir.
What is it now?
Need your signature, sir.
Who are you?
- Where's your father?
- He's not here.
The fuck he's not!
He doesn't come here.
You want to find my father?
I've got nothing to do with my father.
I'm not like him.
No shit.
You're just a weak version of him.
Let's work things out.
I'll make you an offer.
Trust me, buddy. OK?
I'm telling you, I have no idea
where my dad is.
Take anything you want here.
Just don't hurt me.
Wait. Listen to me first.
You sound familiar.
Mr. Rizal?
Mr. Rizal, open the door!
Bro, you're one slick fucker.
Yeah, sure! Why not?
Hang on, check this out.
It's really good stuff.
Fucking hell!
Mr. Rizal? We're coming in!
Check the rooms!
Stay down! Damn it!
Who are you?
How dare you? You know whose son that is?
Shut up! Back off!
Out Of my way!
Back off!
Where you gonna run?
Just let me go!
- Fuck that!
- No, fuck you!
Grab his gun, damn it!
Grab him!
Don't go!
Come on!
Don't move!
He's heading for the lobby.
Come here, you!
Don't lose him!
Close the gate!
Get him!
- Hey, have you seen Ahmad?
- No idea.
Where is he?
Have we met?
Take a good guess.
No, stop!
Let me go.
What the fuck? You're asking for it.
I'm calling Ahmad.
What are you...
Hey!
Sir, is this your car?
Yes.
You're not allowed to park here.
I'll move it right away.
Can I see your license?
Shuhei Nomura
Mr. Shuhei Nomura.
Please check.
Wow, you're soaked.
Oh, you know. It's very hot.
What happened there?
Just a small scratch.
What are you doing here?
I was there, having dinner.
- Dinner!
- Yeah.
What did you have?
What's the problem, Officer?
There have been some incidents here.
We're being cautious.
Well, please wait here.
Copy that.
- The car is registered under his name.
- But something feels wrong.
It's all good.
But, sir...
That lot will wear you down
with their endless excuses.
Stay away from them.
We've got to follow every lead, sir...
Don't worry about it.
Trust me, son.
Go!
Hey, Muroi! There's been
a murder in a club!
Let's go!
You're free to go.
But don't park here again.
Let's give him a great show.
Nomura...
I know you're in there.
I need to talk to you!
You did something to Soichi!
Nomura! What did you do to Soichi?
He attacked a classmate!
The school is going to expel him!
I know whose fault this is.
He told me everything.
How could you? He could've killed that boy!
It's his choice.
- What's wrong with it?
- What?
Hisae, it's your fault.
Why would you say that?
Soichi's just a stupid kid.
He has to look up to somebody.
He has no choice but to be miserable.
And you are responsible, Hisae.
Like him, I loved my sister.
She meant the world to me.
When I was 9 years old,
I knew she should be all mine.
And I promised myself,
"I'll kill anyone who hurts her."
I didn't care about my mother...
And hated my father.
Soichi told me you mean the world to him.
That kid's not so different after all.
What are you trying to say?
Like I said, he really loves you.
But you tried to kill him.
<i>- I didn't...
- Yes, you did.</i>
I saw everything.
You left him on the road,
hoping a car would run him over.
It didn't work out, though.
- You're wrong.
- I'm not! You wanted him dead.
You don't know anything!
It's written all over your face.
The urge to kill.
Life's hard for us.
<i>I wanted us to die together.</i>
<i>But I couldn't go through with it.</i>
I know I was wrong.
I will never leave Soichi!
But...
If Soichi dies, I'll die!
Now that's just stupid.
Remember what we talked about
in your flower store.
Life is cruel for someone like him.
You should have killed him.
You're sick!
Tell me the truth, please.
You just failed that night, right?
Oh, God.
Stay away from us!
Wait here.
Help! Help me!
Someone, please!
I told you...
You should've stayed away.
Your pretty flowers are all dead now.
Everything's over now.
Who's there?
That's Midori. I don't know her real name.
I thought you understood me.
What are you doing to her?
Do you really want to know?
Do you really?
Don't touch me!
You're so clueless.
You don't even know me!
My mother and sister killed themselves.
But did they really?
I'm sure it wasn't me.
You believe me, right?
I killed 7 people, including my father.
Also, a homeless guy. Almost forgot.
Hold on, I'm losing count... Maybe more?
Stop talking!
Please, help me! Help me please.
- I'll take this off.
- It hurts so bad.
This way!
Please... I want to go home.
There's someone I need to see.
<i>Dad.</i>
Wake up, Dad.
OK.
Elly?
- Why are you here? Who's with you?
- Mom's here.
Stay here.
Dad?
Yes, dear?
Are we going to be OK?
I don't want to know
what you got yourself into.
Elly's fine, right?
So, you can say your goodbyes.
Wait, we'll get through this, darling.
Let me clean up. Just wait and I'll...
I mean, I want you to wait for me.
We'll all go out like before. You, Elly...
Let's have lunch. Let's discuss this.
Work it out like old times.
Remember those times? I still love you!
Are you insane? You've ruined everything!
You ruined me and Elly!
I'm tired of all this.
Do you recognise me?
Does Elly even recognise me?
I fucked up, Dina.
Please forgive me.
I'm begging you.
You two are all I have.
Please forgive me.
Sister...
Everything has to end.
OK. Got everything you need?
Yup.
- Study hard, OK?
- I will.
Dad?
I love you too, honey.
Take care.
Bye, Dad.
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Dina, are you still at my place?
<i>- Just' a quick makeover.
- You shouldn't have.</i>
OK, we can drop by the laundry after this.
<i>We can go pick Elly up, too.</i>
Sure! We'll pick her up.
Also, Elly just told me something.
<i>I'll tell you later.</i>
<i>Did you hear what I said?</i>
<i>Dina?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
I'll call you again, Bayu.
Dina?
What the hell? What are you doing?
Give it to me!
Go! Go! Go!
- Elly?
- Dad!
Elly!
Why? Let her go.
Let my kid go.
My family's killer.
Just leave her alone.
I beg you. She never did anything wrong.
Why do you hate me so much?
Who sent you? Tell me!
No-one. It's just me.
Now let her go!
Dad!
You took so much from me.
But tell me,
why did you have to take my son away?
Why did you have to kill him?
He'd never done you harm.
You sadistic bastard.
Dad!
Look at you now!
Just because you wore a mask,
you think you can kill anyone?
Kill me? You're fucking nobody!
Dad, what's going on?
I'm not gonna hurt your daughter.
I'll raise her.
And when she grows up,
I'll make her my wife.
Mamad!
Mamad!
This is cool!
Who the fuck are you?
What a sad sight.
Why did you start without me?
You're so lost.
Dad? Dad, I'm so scared.
You lunatic!
You're insane!
I'm begging you... Don't!
Don't touch me!
Don't touch!
I thought you understood me.
Dad!
Look, they fell from the roof!
- Is he still moving?
- He's still alive! Call somebody!
And cut.
