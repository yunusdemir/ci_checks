-THIS LITTLE PIGGY WENT
TO MARKET. -[ SQUEALING ]
THIS LITTLE PIGGY STAYED HOME.
AND THIS LITTLE PIGGY, UM...
-HAD ROAST BEEF.
-...HAD ROAST BEEF.
THIS LITTLE PIGGY HAD NONE.
AND THIS LITTLE PIGGY WENT...
-"WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE."
-"WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE, WHEE..."
ALL THE WAY HOME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HUH?
THERE´S A BRIDGE.
LET´S THROW HIM IN THE RIVER.
WHAT RIVER?
JUST SOME TREES DOWN THERE.
IT´S CLOSE ENOUGH.
COME ON,
LET´S GET IT OVER WITH.
[ SQUEALING ]
HAVE A NICE TRIP.
[ GASPS ]
[ SQUEALING ]
[ LAUGHTER ]
-WHOO!
-WHOO!
OH, GORDY,
YOU´RE ALIVE AND KICKING.
BLESS YOUR LITTLE HEART.
THEY´RE LEAVING.
LET´S GET OUT OF HERE.
WATCH YOUR BACKS.
COMING THROUGH.
DON´T WORRY, HANKY.
WE´LL FIND HIM.
I´M TELLING YOU,
HE´S RUN AWAY.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
-GORDY WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
-HANK´S RIGHT.
<i>HANKY´S WRONG,
AND IT´S ABOUT TIME HE WOKE UP.</i>
-YOUR MOTHER AGREES WITH ME.
-I DO NOT AGREE.
FORGET GORDY.
HE´S HISTORY.
LOOK WHO I JUST FOUND.
-[ SNORTING ] -HERE
YOU GO. -GORDY!
THERE, YOU SEE? YOU WERE WRONG.
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
WHERE WAS HE?
I WAS UP ON THE RIVER RIDGE
ROAD, RIGHT WHERE THE ROAD FORKS.
TALK ABOUT YOUR NINE LIVES.
[ TELEPHONE RINGS ]
WELL, YOU´RE SAFE.
THAT´S ALL THAT COUNTS.
-I´M -- I´M --
-PHONE CALL FOR COUSIN JAKE.
EXCUSE ME.
THANK YOU.
HELLO. THIS IS COUSIN JAKE.
Hey, I was watching
your telethon program.
You tell Gordy
I´ve got an idea
as to where he might look
for his folks.
GORDY´S RIGHT HERE.
LISTEN TO THIS, EVERYBODY.
WHAT IS IT, COUSIN JAKE?
Well, I delivered a load
of Meadow Brook farm pigs
up to the fattening yards
in Broken Bow.
MEADOW BROOK FARM?!
IT´S GOT TO BE THEM!
Could be.
Most of those pigs
get hauled off
to that big slaughterhouse
in Omaha.
Sure hope you get them in time.
See you, Cousin Jake.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU KINDLY, MA´AM.
WAIT.
I REMEMBER YOUR GRANDPA
ONCE TOLD ME
THAT WE OWN A PROCESSING PLANT
IN OMAHA!
YOU MEAN A SAUSAGE FACTORY?
I THINK YOU´RE MISTAKEN,
JESSICA.
THERE IS NO SUCH PLANT.
MR. BRINKS HAS
THE INVENTORY SHEET. SHOW THEM.
WHAT ABOUT THIS?
[ GASPS ] NO!
ROYCE PROCESSING PLANT,
6 COLFAX STREET, OMAHA!
-[ SQUEALS ]
-[ GASPS ]
[ GASPS ]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH HANKY´S INHERITANCE.
YOU DON´T HAVE TO BE
SO GRABBY, MR. SNIPES.
GO PLAY YOUR BANJO, GOOBER!
BANJO? GOOBER?
EASY, LUKE.
-GOOBER?!
-EASY, LUKE. WHAT THE --
WHY DIDN´T YOU SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS BEFORE?
WHY SHOULD I?
IT WAS AN EXECUTIVE DECISION.
I DON´T HAVE TO ACCOUNT --
YOU DON´T HAVE TO RAISE
YOUR VOICE
IN FRONT OF THE YOUNG ONES.
KEEP OUT OF THIS,
YOU IGNORANT HAYSEED.
[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]
UGH!
[ GROANS ]
[ CHUCKLES ]
I THINK WE MAKE
A PRETTY GOOD TEAM.
THANK YOU FOR STEPPING IN.
BRINKS!
[ GASPS ]
THANKS FOR THE USE
OF YOUR BRIEFCASE.
MOM, WE´VE GOT TO GET MOVING!
-COME ON!
-WE´LL TAKE THE LIMO.
-OH!
-OH! [ LAUGHS ]
LET´S GO.
HURRY.
IN THE BACK. MOVE QUICK.
[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]
-THEY THE ONES FOR OMAHA?
-YEAH.

-I WANT TO GO HOME.
-COME ON, GET ON UP THERE.
-GET ON UP THERE.
-GET IN, MAMA.
LOOKS LIKE THE END OF THE LINE
FOR THESE PIGS.
YEAH.
[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]
YOU´VE GOT TO CLOSE THE FACTORY
BEFORE IT´S TOO LATE.
DON´T WORRY, GORDY.
[ Telephone ringing ]
IT´S RINGING!
[ GULPS ]
We´re not here at the moment,
so please leave a message.
-IT´S AN ANSWERING MACHINE.
-LEAVE WORD.
ATTENTION, NIGHT SUPERVISOR,
THIS IS HANK ROYCE.
REPEAT, CLOSE THE FACTORY
IMMEDIATELY.
[ CELLPHONE BEEPS ]
LET´S HOPE THEY CHECK
THEIR MESSAGES.
[ GULPS ]
LISTEN, FRIENDS,
LET´S FACE IT.
WE MIGHT NOT GET THERE
ON TIME.
WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO?
I´M HAVING TROUBLE
WITH MY CONSCIENCE,
AND, WELL...
IF I CONFESS,
WILL YOU GIVE ME A BREAK?
WE´RE LISTENING.
I´M TRYING TO TELL YOU TO CALL
THE FACTORY NUMBER AGAIN.
BUT I LEFT A MESSAGE.
