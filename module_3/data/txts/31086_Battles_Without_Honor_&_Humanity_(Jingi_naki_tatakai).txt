SHINICHI YAMAGATA
FUTURE UNDERBOSS OF YAMAMORI FAMILY

- Let the girl get away!
Are you all right?
Get away quick.
MPs! Run!
TORU UEDA

You small-fry!
KIYOSHI DOI

Get out of my way!
Let go!
HIROSHI WAKASUGI
CAPTAIN OF DOI FAMILY
Bring him here.
Assholes!
Gonna beat me up or what?
Get him!
Make him stand up.
I'll cut off your right arm.
Please don't!
Welcome, welcome!
Form a line!
Put your money here.
SHUJI YANO

MASAKICHI MAKIHARA
FUTURE UNDERBOSS OF YAMAMORI FAMILY
We need more!
Bring some rice here.
Damn it!
You punk!
Add it to the pot. Doesn't matter.
Hurry!
Hey, Makihara!
Hurry, move!
They're back.
There they are.
UICHI SHINKAI
FUTURE UNDERBOSS OF YAMAMORI FAMILY
Fuckin' cops!
SEIICHI KANBARA
FUTURE UNDERBOSS OF YAMAMORI FAMILY
TETSUYA SAKAI
FUTURE CAPTAIN OF YAMAMORI FAMILY
Cut that old-fashioned crap!
How dare you?
It's my favorite song.
Step right up.
Let's go.
Give me a cup of sake.
- What happened, Yamagata?
- He was cut.
Who did it?
I got into a fight with a <i>yakuza</i>
at the black market.
He tried to stop it.
The <i>yakuza</i> came after him
with a sword.
I'll take care of him.
I have a friend in the Yamamori family.
Tell him to bring weapons and come.
Right.
Get a hold of yourself.
Where's the fight?
At the black market.
Let's split up and go.
I'll show you how to kill a man.
Join us?
You have to conceal that.
Wait!
Help me get up.
- Thank you.
- Pull yourself together.
Check that way.
There was some trouble, huh?
Kanbara and Sugiya
have been beaten up.
Let's go and see.
Hang tough!
Are you all right?
Did they get you?
Yeah.
We took 'em on
but they were really tough.
We were trapped.
He was a hard-core <i>yakuza</i>.
Hard-core or not, it's just a fight.
Go after him yourself, then.
I don't know the guy.
We better go to the market
for help, guys.
What do you say I go after him?
It was my friend they hurt.
Besides...
Won't you lose face
if you go after him and lose?
Do you have a weapon?
No. I'll get one somewhere.
Where's the guy now?
Acting up in a bar over there.
Hey!
If you're gonna take him on,
take this with you.
He's the one.
You back again?
I'll kill you.
Why you?
Hey, I shot him, all right.
Beat it!
Pray.
Where're you going?
Shut up!
I'll go see the warden.
Get back to your seat.
This is bullshit!
Where's our rationed rice?
Know your place.
Give us back the rationed rice
you guys ate on the sly!
Shut up or you'll get even less!
How long are you in for?
Twelve years.
With a term like that,
you could get out on bail now.
Every prison is over flowing now.
For 12 years,
you need 50,000 <i>yen</i>.
I don't have anywhere to get
that kind of money from.
I'm going to commit <i>hara-kiri</i>.
I need your help.
What's the point of cutting
open your stomach?
The prison quacks can't patch me up.
They'll let me out on bail.
When the time's right,
start hollering "suicide."
If I screw it up and it looks like
I'm in too much pain,
just strangle me to death.
Got that?
Leave it to me.
Let's be sworn brothers, shall we?
I'm Hiroshi Wakasugi,
a captain from the Doi family.
I knew that.
But I'm not involved
in your <i>yakuza</i> racket.
Nobody's born a <i>yakuza</i>.
Why don't you follow me?
I'm little for introductions,
but the name's Shozo Hirono.
We can't toast with sake,
so we slit our arms
and suck blood instead.
If I manage to get out,
I'll find someone
who can put up bail for you.
Here goes, okay?
Do I call 'em?
Can I call 'em now?
I'm calling them! Okay!
Suicide here!
Suicide!
Jailor, get in here!
He'll die!
Here he comes.
Hey, Hirono, congratulations!
Thanks for coming.
I'm glad you're safe.
Yamamori's here, too.
He put up bail for you.
Let's go.
YOSHIO YAMAMORI
FUTURE BOSS OF YAMAMORI FAMILY
Boss, this is Hirono.
Thanks for everything.
I'll work hard to repay you.
Forget it.
You acted as a substitute for my man.
I should've known that earlier.
I had no idea until Doi told me.
Thanks for looking
after Wakasugi in the pen.
He's still stuck in the hospital.
I'm here to thank you on his behalf.
- This is just a token.
- Please, Hirono.
You're great.
Boss Doi coming to meet you and all.
Let's go.
<i>The Yamamori family
was formed that year.</i>
<i>The young men pledged
their loyalty with sake.</i>
We've simplified the ceremony
to suit the times.
<i>Doi, the boss of the Doi family,
bore witness.</i>
<i>Kenichi Okubo,
an elder of the underworld,</i>
KENICHI OKUBO
<i>acted as go-between.</i>
Please empty your cups at once,
gentlemen.
Game's in play.
Place your bets.
1949
We're ready.
Game.
Get it together, dealer.
Can't you offer a little better service?
You crawled out of the black market.
- What the hell!
- Why, you!
Stop it!
I hope you can go back
to enjoying yourself.
How about beer?
Pour it.
Let's continue.
Place your bets. Please.
Is this horse piss?
Bring some cold beer.
Asshole!
Fuckin' punk!
If it's horse piss you want,
we got it!
I'll drink it!
Get outside.
Cut it out, cut it out!
Stop fighting!
Welcome back.
How did it go?
What'd you have to do that for?
The guy he picked a fight with
happened to be Ueda.
He happens to be a distant relation
to Boss Okubo, your go-between.
I tried to find someone who could
make peace between the two.
Ueda alone would be one thing,
but with Okubo behind him,
everybody refused,
saying it was too much.
What'll you do?
Apologize to the boss with money.
Getting carried away like that.
Enough...
Why bother if there's no profit?
I'll cut off my little finger.
Will that settle the matter?
Cut your finger off, huh?
At least that won't
cost us anything. Fine.
I always knew the boss was cheap,
but this is too much.
We'll fight Okubo with you anytime.
The boss has many business interests.
I'm sure he's got
a different perspective.
Are you really going to cut it off?
You'll regret it for life.
I gave my word, so I have to.
But I don't know how to.
Does anybody know?
If nobody else does,
I'll tell you how to do it.
I saw it once,
back when I was in Osaka.
Turn it over.
Not with the <i>tatami</i> side facing up.
Is this the right way, ma'am?
Use the weight of your body
to slice through in a single breath.
Are you all right?
- My hand's numb.
- Take him to the hospital.
The finger's gone!
What?
Maybe it flew off into the garden.
What a disaster if it's lost.
Look for it.
It can't be far.
I found it!
Where?
The hens pecked it.
Look how pathetic it is
You didn't have to go this far,
Yamamori.
It was just a quarrel
between hot-blooded youth.
Besides, it was all Ueda's fault.
Let's call it water under the bridge.
We appreciate your generosity.
Commit this finger to the earth
in a lavish ceremony.
This should help you
with the burial costs.
Well, that's too...
It's only a trifle.
I'd like to use this opportunity
to ask your help
in making a man of Ueda.
As you know, I stay on the sidelines.
I'm counting on you.
I'm happy to be of service
to you anytime.
Gentlemen.
I look forward to your guidance.
We'll make a fearsome team
if we band together.
Right, Yamamori?
By the way, there's someone
I want to introduce you to.
Will you meet him?
With pleasure, boss.
Actually, it's Nakahara,
a municipal assemblyman.
SHIGETO NAKAHARA
As you know,
there's 50 billion <i>yen</i> worth
of hoarded Navy goods
lying around this town.
I want to turn 'em over
for the reconstruction of this city,
but the Kanamaru faction
is against it.
<i>They put a nice spin on things,
but the truth is,</i>
<i>they plan to appropriate 'em
for Ikejima's campaign fund.</i>
SHOICHI KANAMARU
<i>The matter will be decided
with an assembly vote,</i>
<i>The matter will be decided
with an assembly vote,</i>
<i>but right now it's 50-50.</i>
Which brings me to the favor
I need to ask you.
What do they want you to do?
They want me to eliminate a vote
for the Kanamaru faction.
What was your answer?
I couldn't exactly refuse, could I?
After Okubo had introduced us...
And besides, Ueda's on board, too.
Boss.
The Kanamaru faction is supported
by Doi from our town.
And Doi never liked Ueda.
If we side with Nakahara,
we may have to take on Doi.
Boss.
I think Okubo's pulling the strings
on this whole scheme.
Even if Ueda's involved,
he's using us to get at Doi.
He's not such a schemer as all that.
But listen, if the Kanamarus win,
Doi will get totally out of hand.
We're no match for Doi
if all we've got is Ueda.
I have no intention
of walking into a trap.
You're telling me
to take on Okubo?
Which is why I told you not to show
your weakness to Okubo.
Listen to me, Tetsuya and Shozo.
I'm in an awkward position, you see?
Besides, Nakahara gave me his word
that he would arrange for the bank
to loan me operating funds.
No collateral, no interest,
for as long as I want.
We <i>yakuza</i> have to fight with money now.
We'll never get this big chance again.
We'll just keep Doi
in the dark about it.
Please, do it for me.
I need your help.
Please.
Sakai.
See how the boss is asking us...
So I don't mind.
But you and Doi's Wakasugi
are sworn brothers.
Leave it to me, then.
You don't tell a soul about this.
No, you don't...
That's all.
I'll take care of you later.
Tomorrow's the crucial vote.
Honey, honey?
MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY VOTE
The vote's invalid!
Pull back, Kanamaru!
It all worked out.
The vote is over.
Send "the package" back.
Will do.
I'm Tetsuya Sakai
from the Yamamori family.
Now you know my name,
I can't hurt you.
But you behave yourself, too.
That way, please.
I'm going on a little trip.
If anything happens with Doi,
tell him I asked you along.
We arranged everything
behind the scenes.
Those assemblymen
are <i>kowtowing</i> to us today.
You're painting the town red,
aren't you?
How's things?
May I sit here?
Why not?
Look, Kanbara.
Fill me in on the scoop
about the 50 billion <i>yen</i>.
Yamamori pulled the strings, right?
Welcome. He's waiting.
Thanks for coming.
Send 'em home and close the shop.
What's the deal?
We're in a real mess.
Kanbara fessed up to everything.
It's not for me to say, but he is
my brother after all, so I'm here.
I appreciate it, man.
Thanks for telling us.
Can you use your influence
to put in a good word with Doi?
I only did it
because Okubo asked me to.
I'm counting on you.
He won't listen to me, so...
I'll go see Boss Kaito in Hiroshima.
Let him mediate.
Hide yourself in the meantime.
We have to avoid
going to war over this.
I know, I know.
You keep your men under control.
All right.
Thanks for everything.
What's done is done.
Who is it?
It's me, Kanbara.
Lend me your phone, will you?
That double-crosser. Let him in.
What are you doing here, Wakasugi?
Boss, listen...
Get out of the way!
Yamamori.
You crossed me!
What're you doing!
Are you siding with him?
Hold it.
You should've killed him
before I came.
Let's not let this get between us.
This is between those assemblymen.
We're no better than dogs!
The hell!
I'll throw you out.
I'm warning you, boss.
You're not killing him,
not while I'm alive.
I'll kill you if you try.
Wakasugi...
I'll remember this!
Kanbara! You punk!
Stop!
He's not worth it.
Forgive me.
Today I learned
what you're really made of.
I'm going to have to depend on you
for more support.
I'm begging you.
<i>After this incident, Wakasugi became
a guest member of the Yamamori family.</i>
HIROSHIMA CITY
<i>But, of course, neither Yamamori nor Doi
were about to bury the hatchet.</i>
THE KAITO FAMILY
<i>Six months later, news reached Hirono,
hiding out in Hiroshima at Kaito's.</i>
You have a guest, Shozo.
- Take my place.
- All right.
Wakasugi?
What brings you here?
We have to talk.
Step out with me a minute, will you?
What happened?
Doi plans...
to run the show in this town.
He'll be here to meet Kaito soon.
Did Doi pull something?
Yeah.
He made that shithead Kanbara
his henchman.
They're breaking into Yamamori's turf.
I see.
It's time to set things straight.
You'd better not stay here.
Bro...
you aren't going to kill Doi, are you?
I'm the one who has to.
You can't.
He's still your boss.
You'll become a laughing stock.
You can't touch him.
Let's talk it over
with Yamamori and the others first.
Boss, why didn't you
let me know earlier?
If I made noises about it,
Doi would've caught on.
Which is why I only told Wakasugi.
Wakasugi told you the truth.
I'm minding my own business.
But Doi barges in on whatever I do.
My husband is so furious.
He barely sleeps at night.
But why did you only talk it over
with Wakasugi?
What about us?
I appreciate your concern,
but what can I do?
If it turns into a fight,
it'll affect my business.
We're well beyond the point of
your worrying about your business.
Just kill 'em off.
Shozo.
You've got a point, you do.
We can't very well pull it off
in Hiroshima.
What if the six of us here
take the fight to Doi now?
Sounds good to me.
What about the rest of you?
You can count me in, but...
I haven't been feeling so well lately...
There must be some other way.
Right?
Tell me, what other way?
What do you say?
What's the matter Makihara?
I'm not afraid to die, but...
my wife is with child.
When I think about what might
happen to her, I just feel so bad.
I get it.
You're out, then.
Go home and look after your wife.
Thank you.
Excuse me, then, boss.
Shit!
What a useless piece of shit.
Fuck it all!
I'll just fight it out
with Doi personally!
Honey.
Only our family will be ruined.
Go your own way if I die!
Boss.
What's the big fuss
over getting rid of Doi?
Don't worry.
I feel bad for Kaito,
but I'll take him down in Hiroshima.
Shozo!
If this thing spreads
to a fight between the families,
you're the key man.
Please stay here.
Shozo.
You've already been convicted
a couple of times.
This time, you might get
the death penalty.
Maybe, but...
Sakai isn't here. You're the only man
who can get Doi alone.
Leave it to me.
I won't regret it...
even if I am put to death.
I'm a <i>yakuza</i>, after all.
Shozo...
I'll owe you for this forever.
Make a man of me.
I'm begging you.
Please, boss.
But should you get out of prison
after serving time, say 20 years...
I'll give you my whole property.
I'm good at money-making.
I'll just imagine
I'm making all the money for you.
He's telling the truth.
We have no children.
We're always talking about you,
you know?
If anything were to happen to you,
we'll look after your affairs.
Shozo, this is all the money
we've got.
Go enjoy yourself with it.
That's too much.
Don't worry. Take it.
It's all we can do for you
for the present.
Forgive me.
I'll join you later on.
Shozo.
You're lucky to have such genuine people
like the boss and the madam.
You're so fortunate.
That hurts.
Be more gentle.
I've got no time.
OCTOBER 16, 1949
What's the matter?
What's the long face for?
I just don't feel right.
- You got one?
- A tile?
Ask someone upstairs.
- Whose turn is it?
- My turn.
Hello.
Hello, sir.
I'm Doi.
Is Kaito in?
Yes. Please come in.
Hirono?
You're staying here?
Please come again.
Convey my thanks to Kaito.
Hold it!
Get out of my way!
Shozo, stop it!
Boss!
Hirono!
Send for a doctor, quick!
Bro?
I'm in a hideout
the madam arranged for me.
How is Doi?
He was carried in to a hospital.
He's still breathing.
I want to go see you,
but the cops are everywhere.
Doi's men are after Boss Yamamori.
I'm worried about that, too.
Doi's men don't know
where you are.
Hang in there till I get there.
Okay.
I'll be seeing you. Good-bye!
Kanbara?
Boss Yamamori gave me a call
a little while ago.
He wanted to get you out of here.
He did?
The cops are all over him.
And the Kaitos are looking for him, too,
so he's stuck.
The Doi's are up the street, but...
they won't recognize me,
so he asked me.
Which is why I came alone.
You don't trust me?
How would I know about this place
if he hadn't ask me?
You don't trust me, huh?
It can't be helped.
I'm going.
Hey. Wait a minute.
I'll get ready.
What's wrong?
The engine's busted.
Gimme a minute.
Kanbara!
Kanbara!
<i>Abandoned by everything
and everyone,</i>
<i>his only path was
to go back to prison.</i>
Doi died.
Yamamori's got the upper hand.
Sakai's back.
My duty's over.
I'm sorry for you,
but I'm taking myself a little trip.
You saved Yamamori from ruin.
So what if Sakai's back?
Please stay on with Yamamori.
But I'm starting to have trouble
figuring Yamamori out.
Why did he send Kanbara to you?
What were his real intentions?
He's crafty and impossible to read.
What did you think?
Time's up.
Take good care of yourself.
Brother.
I'll join up with you
when I get out of here.
Wait for me for sure.
I'll join you.
What did you want?
I have to ask you a favor.
Why you, Wakasugi?
Sorry.
I need you alone.
I'm going on a trip.
How is everything
with the Doi family?
They're doing nicely.
Don't worry.
Now I'm relieved.
What would happen
if you were gone?
DECEMBER 17, 1949
SEIICHI KANBARA DIED
Someone threw this
into the police station.
A map of the city.
Number 26, 1-chome?
What's this?
I checked up on it.
The house belongs to the parents
of the <i>yakuza</i> Wakasugi's mistress.
A quarrel among <i>yakuza</i>?
It fits you perfectly.
You look like my brother
who died in the war.
- A bogus varsity boy, eh?
- The cops won't know.
You're always kind to my daughter.
Don't bother, Mother.
We're going to Osaka
tomorrow morning early. Wake us.
What's that noise?
Pretend you're asleep, Mama.
Come over here.
Hurry!
What's up?
Go back to sleep, dear.
Mrs. Kunihiro!
Who is it?
Yes, just a second.
Who are you?
Wakasugi is here, isn't he?
No, he isn't.
Your lover, right?
Let us check.
The kids are sleeping!
Don't wake 'em up!
Hiroshi!
Hiroshi!
You <i>yakuza</i> punk!
DECEMBER 17, 1949
HIROSHI WAKASUGI DIED
<i>The Korean Warbroke out in 1950.</i>
<i>The Yamamori family got a contract loading
ammunition for the US military.</i>
<i>Even as they expanded,
the men were out of hand.</i>
<i>What had led to their decline</i>
<i>was when they began dealing philopon,
a drug popular at that time.</i>
Get in line.
- Gimme!
- Here's yours.
YAMAMORI HQ UNDER POLICE SEARCH
SUSPECTED OF DEALING DRUGS
How dare you!
Give me that!
What the hell are you doing!
Sir.
Arita, I told you
not to deal <i>philopon</i>.
TOSHIO ARITA
UNDERBOSS, SHINKAI FAMILY
You're sticking your nose
in everything we do.
The police think
we're birds of a feather.
We won't bungle it.
- Brother.
- Don't make any waves.
You fucking moron.
I'll teach you a lesson.
Come!
You count all that up
to the last <i>yen</i>.
Nobody making anything on the side.
I'll let you have it if you do.
Arita belongs to my family.
Whatever it is, you talk to me.
I told you, but you didn't listen.
What's your beef?
At your level, who gives a damn
over a little drug business?
The boss wants him to quit dealing.
He's one to talk.
You guys take plenty off the top.
So we make a little
on the side with drugs.
How are they supposed
to make a living?
Of course they deal drugs.
You serious?
This is my turf.
Go home.
If that's your attitude,
let's take this thing
straight to the boss.
Till then.
What an asshole,
always going on about the boss.
Is he his successor?
Hey, boys.
Check out where they sold the drugs
they took away from us.
To be frank with you, boss,
I think he's got a point.
We have more men now.
Your rake-off is so high.
They're pressed.
I talked the matter over with Ueda.
The rent of a gambling hall
can be the same.
But pinball game shops and bars...
Well, let 'em be free
from rake-offs.
I see, but...
you think the family
can survive on that?
We'll try not to depend
on you too much.
Each of us
can become self-sustaining.
They do it that way
in all the big families.
Self-sustaining basis, eh?
Is it really possible?
I've collected the little money you raise
and invested it in bigger businesses.
That's how we got this far.
But you don't remember that.
You're on your own, then!
Boss,
I think he's right.
Your 70% commission is too high.
Riding around
in your fancy foreign cars...
Fork it over instead to the young men.
What the hell!
I disagree, bro.
What are you saying, Shinkai?
You're the one that started this!
If we follow your plan,
the boss will be in name only.
Only a few will wind up
with the lion's share.
You referring to me?
The boss needs to stay the boss,
just like he is.
Only the rest of the profits
should be split equally among us.
Right, Yano?
I support what Shinkai said.
We've got to stay together,
or they'll tear us apart.
What Yano says is right.
I'll leave it up to you to decide.
But for the record,
what kind of a <i>yakuza</i> son
begrudges money to his father?
Shit.
Who's the one
doing the begrudging here?
Okay, let's get this decision over with.
Who's against my plan?
Only Yano and Shinkai, huh?
Then we go with my plan, all right?
Captain.
You didn't make
the Yamamori family all by yourself.
Are you pissing on the captain's vote?
You can fight me then!
Wanna fight?
- Hold it.
- Hey, hey!
Let's go.
Shinkai.
The police will bother us
if Arita is with us.
Stash him away for six months.
You've been stashed for six months.
Bro.
Know what happened
to the drugs Sakai pinched?
Boss Yamamori is selling 'em off
in Hiroshima.
The boss is?
Sakai is in on it with him.
You're being kept for chump change.
What will it be, sir?
Coffee.
Shinkai.
There's a man who wants to meet you.
Will you meet him?
Like I'm always telling Arita,
as long as a man's making a name for himself,
he can't be taken advantage of.
Once you let someone beat you,
you'll never live it down.
That's the way this world works.
Even more so in the <i>yakuza</i> world.
At times, you're going to have
to have the guts to stake your life,
or you'll never be a boss.
Make a man of yourself, Shinkai.
I'll back you up.
In order to do that,
you have to set your heart on becoming
Yamamori's successor.
Yamamori himself is not
your problem, though.
The problem is Sakai.
You've got to get rid of him,
and soon,
or neither you nor Arita
stand a chance.
I know that all too well.
If you're so inclined,
I'll give you some nice presents.
Have I gone far in my jesting?
Actually, I'm dead serious.
If you can get it together
to reconstruct the Doi family,
you'll be a real boss for sure.
<i>Assemblyman Kanamaru's plan
was to involve the Shinkai faction</i>
<i>and set them up against Sakai.</i>
OCTOBER 28, 1954
SHINICHI YAMAGATA DIED
Arita,
you the one who killed Yamagata?
What?
The man who turned himself in
was one of your dealers.
Don't act like you don't know.
Don't you even know
how to pick a fight?
Cut it out.
Did you get my message?
To get out of town?
Yeah, I heard.
Get out, then.
Let me ask you:
Where does the <i>philopon</i>
the boss is dealing come from?
Is anybody but me dealing it?
The boss, dealing <i>philopon</i>?
You don't know shit.
And you're supposed to be captain.
Keep off my turf.
You told me to not to, so I've stayed
away from dealing <i>philopon</i>.
But you're dealing on the side.
Now hear me out.
We had to do something
about the <i>philopon</i> we seized.
So I went to the trouble
of shipping it to Hiroshima
and selling it off, far from where
the cops would sniff it out.
That's just a long-winded excuse.
What about my position?
How dare you challenge your boss!
You made me cut down my take.
I've got to make both ends meet
my own way now.
Go ahead and get out
if you don't like doing things my way.
Boss.
You're just the <i>palanquin</i>.
We've always done the heavy lifting.
Who shed the blood to get us here?
You think you can make it
on your own, <i>palanquin</i>?
As long as you do what we tell you,
we'll keep doing the lifting,
but all the money in the world
won't win you a fight. Got that?
How dare you!
I suggest you expel Shinkai and Arita.
Expel them?
The dead Yamagata's woman told me.
Shinkai and Arita have banded together
with the remnants of the Doi family.
Anyway,
from now on, you shut up
and leave everything to me.
Why didn't you yell at him?
Shut up.
He called you a <i>palanquin</i>.
You're the boss, aren't you?
You deserve their respect.
He can't just order you
to expel Shinkai.
Shinkai's always defending you.
Let 'em have what they want.
They're too young to know
what's what.
They'll just wind up killing
each other off.
They'll figure out I'm a lot more
than a <i>palanquin</i>, sooner or later.
But Ueda's behind Sakai.
Boss?
Talk to me?
About the matter
of expelling Shinkai.
We should talk this thing through.
Sure.
It's a little late tonight.
How about tomorrow morning
after my shave?
That's what I'll do.
Hello, sir. Please wait.
Move.
Who the hell are you?
OCTOBER 29, 1954
TORU UEDA DIED
<i>Upon hearing of Ueda's death,</i>
<i>Sakai rose to meet
the violence of the Shinkai faction,</i>
<i>which devolved into
a bloody struggle to the death.</i>

SHINKAI MAN DIED

Stop!
You assholes, I'm wounded.

TOSHIO ARITA ARRESTED
Go get it.
Bro!
OCTOBER 11, 1954
UICHI SHINKAI DIED
<i>Thus the strife between Sakai and Shinkai</i>
<i>ended in a one-sided victory
for the Sakais.</i>
<i>Soon after that,
being granted a commutation,</i>
<i>Hirono was put on parole
from Gifu prison.</i>
Bro!
Hey!
Yano.
Thanks for the hard time you pulled.
The boss and his wife
came here to greet you.
They did?
Let's go.
Ueda and Shinkai are both dead.
Sakai has no rivals now.
He even organized his own company.
He's completely ignoring me now.
That punk. He's planning to shake me
loose and take over the family.
That violates the <i>yakuza</i> code!
Where's the honor in that?
I feel so pathetic, so sad...
Do you understand me?
Say, Shozo.
Right now, Yano is the only one
who is still kind to us.
If you back us,
the others will follow.
Besides, and you must be
very careful about this...
but Sakai doesn't like the way
we're always talking about you.
He's running his mouth off
about killing you.
It's exactly as she says.
Please help me out here
and do Sakai for me.
I understand.
But I'm fresh out of prison
and don't have a clue
what's going on.
I need some time.
It won't turn out badly for you.
So then you'll help me?
I knew you would.
So, about the future...
Times are hard for the family,
and I can't pay everyone.
But I'll pay your monthly fee
if you do what I tell you.
Go ahead, enjoy yourself.
This is for this month.
We have some other appointments,
so pay for all this out of
your monthly fee she just gave you.
We're counting on you.
I'll see you.
Come see me sometime.
How much is there?
Twelve thousand <i>yen</i>.
That's not enough
to enjoy yourself with.
Are things so bad for the family?
Not at all!
He invested in a boat race company
and is a director there.
He's a respected entrepreneur now.
Last night he threw a lavish
<i>geisha</i> party in Nagoya.
Hirono.
What happened to his promise that
he'd turn his property over to you?
What happened to that?
Excuse me, I'm Hirono,
one of your late husband's friends.
Can I pray to his dead soul?
Please.
Your baby is Yamagata's?
Who's here?
Hirono.
Tetsuya.
Excuse me.
You got hitched up
with Yamagata's woman?
That baby is mine.
Yamamori came to greet me
out of prison.
Nobody else did.
The old man told me...
What's to fight over
in this tiny town?
I'm not fighting with him.
I'm...
thoroughly disgusted with him.
If he were a man of his word,
neither Shinkai nor Yamagata
nor Ueda would have had to die.
But the boss is still the boss.
Guess we didn't know
how to judge a good boss.
I'm going to establish
a company soon.
A harbor transport business.
Makihara and the others
will be involved, too.
We'll use this to go out on our own,
separate from Yamamori.
We'll join forces
with the Kaito family in Hiroshima, too.
Join us, will you?
We'll go back to our original vision
of doing whatever we want to do.
Well...
but...
the boss asked me to kill you,
you see.
Hold it.
Hold it, Shozo!
Don't shoot me.
There must've been some
misunderstanding.
Wait!
Sit down.
Were you really gonna kill me?
Can't even trust me now?
Sakai.
If brother Wakasugi was still alive,
I didn't plan to rejoin Yamamori.
But I thought it over in the pen.
Besides, we didn't become
Yamamori's henchmen
to kill each other off.
Isn't that right?
So he may not act much
like a good boss...
but let's us survivors join forces
to build up the family again.
Otherwise, those who died
will have died for nothing.
I think the boss will understand that.
I'll take a little trip.
Will you talk the matter over
with the boss while I'm gone?
I understand.
I understand exactly.
Be quiet!
Wait up.
Captain!
- What's the matter?
- Captain! Wait!
Wait, captain.
Sakai?
You told Hironoto kill me,
didn't you?
Go ahead and try!
You want me to do it for you?
Come on!
Come on!
Hold it!
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
<i>Sakai played his hand well.</i>
<i>Yamamori announced his retirement.</i>
<i>Sakai's company was organized.</i>
<i>On the occasion of its celebration,</i>
<i>Sakai learned of Yano's plot.</i>
<i>Yano seems to have gone to see
Kaito in Hiroshima.</i>
<i>He did?</i>
<i>He was against you.</i>
<i>He wants to stop Kaito
from going hand in hand with you.</i>
<i>Go to Hiroshima right away.</i>
<i>Don't let Yano see Kaito.</i>
Sir!
Hello, Yano!
How's it going?
Sir!
FEBRUARY 18, 1956
SHUJI YANO DIED
Game!
MATSUYAMA, SHIKOKU ISLAND
Phone call for you.
Hello, Hirono speaking.
Makihara?
Did you read this morning's paper?
Yano was killed by someone
from the Sakais.
Yano, killed?
I have an urgent matter
to discuss with you.
All right, I'll be right back.
Thanks for coming, pal.
Come with me.
Who else?
I get it.
He's a director here.
Makihara.
I thought you were with Sakai.
The boss knows everything I do.
I thought you were more dependable.
I confided in you
'cause I trusted you.
You spilled it all to Sakai,
didn't you?
So he blackmailed me
to announce my retirement.
He made it public on the occasion
of his company's celebration.
Yano was killed
when he tried to stop it.
In fact, you're the one
who killed Yano.
I thought of killing you for him,
but Makihara stopped me.
You swallowed Sakai's crap!
What a fuckin' idiot!
The boss thinks
there are limits to endurance.
He's determined to get Sakai.
If you feel bad for Yano,
side with us, please.
Sakai's gonna break our family,
together with Kaito.
He's going to start the Sakai family.
You going to work for Sakai?
I'm not forcing you.
You see what I'm made of, don't you?
Don't come crying to me later.
Boss.
I want to be very clear about this.
Sakai may be bad,
but you're just as bad.
- The pot calling the kettle black.
- What!
I've had it with you.
I won't fall for your tricks anymore.
I'm turning in my pledge to you.
So stop thinking of me as your man.
Hirono.
I'll settle my grudge with Sakai
on my own.
You just stay away.
Wait!
You'll never find Sakai.
Even his woman's house is a secret.
He's here after 3:00 p.m. every day.
Room 403 in this hotel.
Hey.
Were you the one who wrote out
Wakasugi's hiding place
and squealed to the police?
That's a thing of the past.
Who knows?
Long time no see, bro.
Freeze!
You came to kill me?
That's right.
Did Yamamori ask you to?
I broke with him.
I came on my own.
Why?
Why don't you ask yourself
that question?
Freeze.
You and I are no longer brothers.
Go ahead, kill me.
I'll keep aiming at you
if you set me free.
Shozo.
You're too idealistic.
You're dreaming.
The code of honor
means shit to Yamamori.
Nothing can be done
unless you have control over reality.
Get wise and help me.
You can be above me, if you want.
I don't give a damn whether
it's the Hirono or the Sakai family.
The point is to crush Yamamori.
Would that bring Shinkai
and Yano back?
If you can't listen,
I'll have to kill you.
Your hands are already stained.
Kill me quick.
Shozo.
Where did we go wrong?
I get sick of this life
when I'm drinking at night.
I want to wash my hands of it.
When I'm with my fellas,
the next morning,
I forget what I thought about
at night.
Let me give you one final warning:
The hunter is stronger than the prey.
Keep your guard up.
Stop there.
I'll get out here.
Go wherever you want.
I can't kill you today.
Some other day.
FEBRUARY 19, 1956
TETSUYA SAKAI DIED
Tet-chan,
are you happy with this show
they're putting on?
Of course you're not.
Neither am I.
How dare you!
Stand back!
SHIGETO NAKAHARA
TSUNEO KAITO
KENICHI OKUBO
Stop!
Do you realize what you're doing?
Yamamori...
I've still got some bullets left...
