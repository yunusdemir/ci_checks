When a Stranger Calls (1979)
I made the reservations for 8:15.
We're gonna be late.
- Dr. Minakis?
- Mandrakis.
It's okay. Everyone gets it wrong
the first time.
- You're Jill. Come on in.
- Hi, Jill. I'm Mrs. Mandrakis.
Honey, could you get this for me,
please? Thank you.
I wrote the number of the restaurant
on the notepad by the phone.
If we're not home in two hours, we've
gone on to a movie till midnight. Okay?
- Sure.
- I've told my service to take calls...
on my office phone, so...
The children are asleep upstairs.
First door on your left
at the top of the landing.
They're both just getting over
really bad colds...
and I had a terrible time getting them
to sleep...
so please try not to wake them.
- Okay.
- Any questions?
- No.
- Great. We're late. Let's go, honey.
Make yourself at home.
The refrigerator's loaded.
- Okay. Bye.
- We even have some low-fat yogurt.
- Honey, come on!
- Bye.
<i>Are you at Dr. Mandrakis's?</i>
Yeah. I've been here
for about an hour.
<i>- Isn't it a neat house?</i>
- I guess. I haven't looked around much.
<i>- Did you see his kids?</i>
- They were asleep.
<i>They're really cute.</i>
<i>So what's goin'on?</i>
Do you think you're gonna be talking
to him sometime tonight?
<i>- Who?</i>
- Bobby.
<i>Probably. You know...</i>
<i>Bobby asked me</i>
<i>to go out with him this weekend.</i>
<i>And I was really tempted...</i>
<i>'cause I like Bobby a lot.</i>
<i>As much as you do.</i>
<i>But I told him I couldn't...</i>
<i>'cause I didn't think it was right</i>
<i>because you were my friend.</i>
You are my friend.
<i>Yeah, I guess so.</i>
Listen, do me a favor.
Just give Bobby the number here.
Okay? Don't tell him I told you to.
<i>Okay. I gotta go now.</i>
Bye, Nance. Thank you.
<i>Yeah. Bye.</i>
Hello?
<i>Have you checked the children?</i>
What?
- Hello?
<i>- Have you checked the children?</i>
Dr. Mandrakis?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Dr. Mandrakis.
Hello?
<i>Have you checked the children?</i>
Robert, I don't think
this is very funny.
Bobby?
Who is this?
<i>- Golden Bull.</i>
- Hello.
Is Dr. Mandrakis there?
This is his baby-sitter.
<i>Hold on a minute.</i>
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Yes.
<i>Dr. Mandrakis left the restaurant</i>
<i>about 40 minutes ago.</i>
- Forty minutes ago.
<i>- That's right.</i>
<i>- Operator.</i>
- Could you get me the police?
<i>- Is this an emergency?</i>
- Yes.
Well, no. Not really.
<i>The number is 555-9431.</i>
<i>Would you like me to connect you?</i>
Yes.
<i>- Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker.</i>
- Hello.
I've been getting phone calls
about every 15 minutes.
It's a man.
I think he's trying to scare me.
<i>An anonymous caller, ma'am?</i>
- That's right.
<i>- Has he threatened you?</i>
<i>Has he been using obscene language?</i>
Sometimes he doesn't say anything.
He just keeps calling.
<i>Well, there's really nothing</i>
<i>we can do about it down here.</i>
<i>- Is the phone listed in your name?</i>
- No, I'm just a baby-sitter.
<i>It's probably just some weirdo.</i>
<i>The city's full of them.</i>
<i>Believe it or not, we get reports</i>
<i>like this every night.</i>
<i>It's nothing to worry about.</i>
- Oh.
<i>- Have you tried whistling?</i>
What?
<i>If you can find a good loud whistle</i>
<i>in the house...</i>
<i>blow it into the phone, hard,</i>
<i>the next time he calls.</i>
<i>Probably break his eardrum.</i>
<i>He won't bother you after that.</i>
No, I...
You're probably right.
It's nothing to worry about.
Hello?
<i>Why haven't you</i>
<i>checked the children?</i>
<i>Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker.</i>
I called you before about the man
who keeps calling me.
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>
- He called me again.
<i>Did you try whistling?</i>
No. He's out there.
<i>Out where?</i>
In the neighborhood.
He's watching me through the windows.
<i>Did you see him?</i>
No, but I know he's there.
<i>- Is the house locked up?</i>
- Yes.
<i>Well, then you're safe. If he wanted to</i>
<i>break in, he wouldn't be calling you.</i>
Please, can't you help me?
I'm all alone here.
<i>Okay. Take it easy. I'll tell you what.</i>
<i>If this guy calls again...</i>
He will call again.
I know he will.
<i>All right. Now, calm down.</i>
<i>Look, I can alert the phone company</i>
<i>so if he calls again...</i>
<i>we can try to trace the call.</i>
<i>What's your number?</i>
555-2368.
<i>And the address?</i>
3317 Oakridge.
<i>Oh, yeah. I know where that is.</i>
<i>Okay, now. If the guy calls again...</i>
<i>you try to keep him on the line for at</i>
<i>least a minute so we can trace the call.</i>
I can't do that. He doesn't stay on
for more than a couple of seconds.
<i>Well, that's the only way</i>
<i>we can help you.</i>
<i>By the way, what's your name?</i>
Jill Johnson.
<i>Jill, the important thing</i>
<i>is for you to relax.</i>
<i>You're safe where you are. We've got</i>
<i>patrolmen cruising that area all night.</i>
<i>Just stay calm.</i>
<i>Will you do that for me?</i>
Yes.
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>we'll be watching your line.</i>
<i>All right, Jill?</i>
- Yes.
<i>- You call again if there's any problem.</i>
<i>Good night.</i>
'Night.
Hello.
<i>It's me.</i>
I know.
Who are you?
I'm not gonna be here
much longer.
Dr. Mandrakis and his wife
are coming home.
<i>I know.</i>
Can you see me?
<i>Yes.</i>
I'm sorry
I turned the lights down.
I'll turn them back up
if you like.
<i>No. Don't.</i>
Don't?
You've really scared me...
if that's what you wanted.
Is that what you wanted?
<i>No.</i>
What do you want?
<i>Your blood.</i>
<i>All over me.</i>
You don't know who I am.
Or where I live.
And Dr. Mandrakis will take me home,
or maybe even the police.
<i>You've called the police?</i>
I wanna talk to you.
- Leave me alone!
<i>- This is Sergeant Sacker. Listen to me.</i>
<i>We've traced the call.</i>
<i>It's coming from inside the house.</i>
<i>A squad car's on the way right now.</i>
<i>Just get outta that house.</i>
<i>1000 Chestnut at 918X.</i>
Are the parents here yet?
Yeah, they arrived
about ten minutes ago.
Christ. What a homecoming.
What happened, Charlie?
We were less than a block away
when the call came through.
When we got here, the guy was still
upstairs in the kids' bedroom.
He was covered with blood.
- Blood?
- Not his own.
The children have been dead
for several hours.
Oh, Jesus.
He'd been using some old phone
the parents never had disconnected.
Who is he?
Well, we found this merchant seaman's
card on him. He's English.
Entered this country
less than a week ago.
How about the baby-sitter?
She'll be all right.
I'm Lieutenant Clifford.
I'm very sorry. I'll try to be brief.
Sit down.
Thank you.
So you're in business
for yourself now.
Yes, sir. For
the past three and a half years.
That's good.
And you'd heard about
Curt Duncan's escape?
Oh, yes.
Do you think the police
will find him?
I know they haven't
assigned anyone to it specifically.
- It's an old case.
- An old case.
- Can you find him?
- Yes.
Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this week,
but I'll find him.
- He could be anywhere by now.
- I don't think so.
Because he's a foreigner,
he'll come back to the city.
After six years in confinement, that's
the only place that's familiar to him.
That's important.
A man murders two children
in cold blood.
Ajury declares him insane.
How could such a person
not be?
He's sent to a state
mental institution...
where the security
is less than perfect.
And he escapes.
It isn't fair.
A thing like that...
should never be allowed
to happen again.
I couldn't agree with you more.
Go ahead, then.
My accountant will contact you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
State Hospital.
<i>Curt Duncan isn't going to run right out</i>
<i>and kill more children.</i>
<i>I'm not worried about that.</i>
<i>We had him in here for six years</i>
<i>under continuous therapy...</i>
<i>some of it rather forceful.</i>
<i>And drugs, tranquilizers,</i>
<i>depressants, lithium...</i>
Eventually anyone will respond
to the treatment here.
You gave him electric shock?
Yes, some.
It says here thirty-eight.
Thirty-eight times?
It's a fairly standard procedure.
Well, what will happen to him now...
without the drugs he was on?
Oh, there'll be some deterioration.
That's inevitable.
We can't say how much.
During the time that you had him here,
did you discover...
any particular habits of his...
peculiarities, quirks?
- Anything that might help me find him?
- Yes, of course.
It's all in the folder,
Mr. Clifford.
Any mail from people
back in England? Family?
That, too, is in the folder.
Let's get something
straight here, Doctor.
I've been 33 years in the business of
tracking people and putting them away.
Spent almost a year on Curt Duncan alone
with the trial and the testimonies...
and the background investigations.
Now, I didn't come here today to look
in your goddamn folders.
In fact, I wouldn't be here at all
if you'd done your job right.
This is a hospital, Mr. Clifford,
not a penitentiary.
Everything appertaining to one of our
patients is meticulously recorded...
in that patient's folder,
whether you can make sense of it...
or not.
Do you want to know how much
we really understand of the human mind?
Listen. This is Curt Duncan...
shortly after he was admitted here
six years ago.
<i>...to give you medication</i>
<i>that will calm you down.</i>
<i>We're not putting anything</i>
<i>in your food, either.</i>
<i>No? I've got to eat the food?</i>
<i>It doesn't taste right!</i>
That's Duncan.
<i>Curt, why are you fidgeting?</i>
<i>Can't you get comfortable?</i>
<i>No! I'm not comfortable!</i>
<i>Don't you look at me.</i>
<i>Don't you talk to me.</i>
<i>Don't you touch me.</i>
<i>Stay away.</i>
<i>- Curt, I'm only trying to help you.</i>
<i>- Stay away.</i>
<i>Guard! Guard!</i>
<i>Grab him! Help!</i>
Hello.
What you been up to?
My own business.
Look. Thanks for the light.
Next round's on me.
Look. I've got my own money.
So if you don't mind.
After what I've been through,
I don't mind anything.
See, that's the whole point.
My mind.
Your mind.
Where do they fit in?
Do you see what I mean?
Okay, pal.
Do you live around here?
Get off of me!
Oh, listen. I didn't mean anything.
I... You see...
- I don't live around...
- Hey!
I think the lady wants to be
left alone.
I think an apology is in order.
Is that the best
you can do?
I think you better move along, pal.
Bill, it's okay, really.
He's...
No! I want him out of here, man!
Are you deaf?
Go on! Beat it!
I'm not gonna say it again, mister.
This is Torchy's.
I want to report a fight.
Who you callin'?
I don't know why I keep coming back
to this dump.
Charlie?
Hey, Cliff.
Let me fix you a drink, man.
- Let me talk to you.
- You want some of this?
- No. Thank you.
- What's goin' on?
I wanna talk to you
in private. Sorry.
- You know these people here.
- Yes, I do.
- What's going on here?
- I wanna talk to you privately.
Huh? Come on. I can't take
any more surprises tonight.
You did this, you dirty dog.
Yeah, you did.
Let's go upstairs for a minute.
All right.
Now, what's going on?
Come on. Tell Papa.
- You getting married?
- No.
I got a job this week,
tracking someone.
Fantastic. I knew you could do it.
- Yeah. Keep up the good work.
- It's Curt Duncan.
- What?
- You didn't know he escaped?
I need your cooperation on this one.
Yeah, sure.
Anything you want. Anything.
Oh, it's you.
What do you want?
I came to apologize.
Listen, I'm the one
who should be sorry.
I didn't mean for that to happen.
I'm new in town.
I don't know anybody.
Where are you from?
Excuse me.
Hello?
No, I just got in.
I don't know if I can.
Listen, I can't talk right now.
Can I call you back?
All right. Bye.
I...
I'm from New York, actually.
Look, you can't come in here.
Well, I thought perhaps
we might get some coffee.
No, I don't think so.
- Somewhere nearby?
- Not tonight.
You'd better go.
I got no place to go.
Well, you can't stay here.
Just a coffee?
Please?
Well, maybe tomorrow.
Okay. Tomorrow. When?
I said maybe. I don't know.
Look, I'm sorry about what happened
this afternoon. I really am.
All right?
That was my boyfriend on the phone.
He's coming over.
So please leave. Now.
- I like you.
- Look!
Do you want me to call the cops?
It's okay.
I'll see you sometime.
Later.
I still want to buy you that drink.
<i>How long will you be here?</i>
<i>Depends on how lucky I get.</i>
<i>I wanna look</i>
<i>through the old files on him.</i>
<i>Check every recent report of assault,</i>
<i>vagrancy, things like that.</i>
Just wanna ask you a question,
Mr. Trumble.
<i>- All right. What do you wanna know?</i>
- What was stolen?
<i>Wake up! God bless it!</i>
<i>Get outta here. Out!</i>
All right! Damn it. All right!
What do ya say, partner?
Hey, looky here.
I'm dry as a bone, man.
You got any money?
Well, keep the picture. If you think
you see him, I'd appreciate a call.
- About four blocks.
- Yeah? Down by the park?
- A foreigner. Has a British accent.
- No, I haven't.
He's about my height.
Light complexion.
<i>I was just with that guy.</i>
<i>Looked bad.</i>
- Where?
- Hell, I can't remember.
Probably see him again, though.
I'll tell you what.
You leave that money with me,
and I'll see that he gets it...
as a favor to you.
I gotta talk to him.
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?
We can work together.
Yeah. Sure.
You keep the bottle, huh?
I'll be back.
- Bar downtown?
- I got the address if you want it.
Appreciate it.
Shit.
Who is it?
My name is John Clifford.
I'm a private investigator.
You're a what?
A private detective.
What do you want with me?
I thought maybe we could talk.
Ask a few questions.
I don't know nothing
about anything or anybody.
Shit.
Listen, lady. I can be back
in 30 minutes...
with a search warrant
and a handful of cops.
I could probably have you arrested,
whether or not the charges would stick.
Now, you wanna let me in and talk?
Have you got a badge?
I'll show you a badge
when you open the goddamn door!
I don't have a badge.
I'm issued a license, a piece of paper.
And I left it at home.
You Tracy Fuller?
Can we sit down?
You recognize this man?
Why?
He's escaped from the insane asylum.
Seven years ago,
he murdered two children.
Broke into the house
and found them asleep in bed.
It was a little boy, four and a half,
and his little three-year-old sister.
After the coroner's investigation,
the bodies were taken to the mortuary...
where the undertaker
took one look at them...
and said their bodies couldn't
be reconstructed for the burial...
without six days of steady work.
Then he asked what had been the murder
weapon, because looking at the mess...
he couldn't imagine
what had been used.
The coroner told him
there had been no murder weapon.
The killer had used only his hands.
He's been here.
Think he'll try to see you again?
I don't know. He...
He said he had no place to go.
Let's play it safe.
Let's assume he will.
Will you work with me?
You found him.
I think so.
Where?
From here on, I go it alone.
Why take a chance on it, Cliff?
- We'll let you have the credit.
- No.
I'm gonna kill him, Charlie.
The closer I get to this guy,
the more...
He gets to me. I don't know.
Look, you better go on home.
You're falling in.
Not this time. This is the case
that makes up for a whole career.
If you don't understand that now,
you will in a few years.
Who hired you to do this?
So now you're a hit man.
Jesus Christ. He killed two kids
in cold blood! You were there too.
What are you gonna use?
Lock needles.
You are straining our friendship.
If you blow this thing at all...
You'll never hear from me again.
All right.
Take your time.
And do it good.
You okay?
All right.
Keep it, honey. My treat.
No luck.
Did you see him?
He still could
be out there, though.
- Oh, God.
- Are you okay?
I'm gonna hang around
outside for a while.
I'll be back, on and off again,
all night.
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.
Bolt your door, and don't
let anybody in, no matter what.
I'll be seein' ya.
Listen.
Thanks.
Sure.
I must talk to you.
I want you to be my friend.
Please?
What's happening, old buddy?
Crazy Curt!
Hey, old fella, well-met
and all that jazz. Looky here.
This is our lucky day. Friend
of yours has got some money for ya...
and we got to get on back down
to the park now and meet him.
Come on, now. Wait. Listen.
He gonna be comin' for you, Crazy Curt.
He's got some M-O-N-E-Y.
We can get us a little joy juice,
partner. Come on, now.
Come...
Come on, man.
What's the matter with you?
You really are crazy.
Hey there, partner!
It's over now.
Come on out.
My name's John Clifford.
I'm a private detective.
I was hired by Alexander Mandrakis
to take you back.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
There'll be no more pain.
You're safe now.
Take it easy, Duncan.
You're all right.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Just come with me.
It's all right, Duncan.
Duncan!
Grab him!
Stop that guy! Hold him!
Come on.
Get out of the way.
Let me through here!
Come on!
Nobody can see me anymore.
Nobody can hear me.
No one touches me.
I'm not here.
I don't exist.
I was never born.
No one can see me anymore.
No one can hear me.
No one touches me.
No one can hear.
I don't exist.
I wasn't born.
Come on.
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, Mommy.
Hi, you guys.
Look what the wind blew in.
- You been playin' hard?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You hungry?
- Yeah.
- What do you want for dinner?
- Hamburgers.
Hamburgers? I never knew
he liked hamburgers, did you?
Can you get that?
Maybe that's Daddy, huh?
- Hello?
<i>- How's my little tiger?</i>
- Okay. When you coming home?
<i>- Real soon.</i>
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>let me talk to Mommy, okay?</i>
- Bye, Daddy.
- Thank you. Hello.
<i>- Hi, babe. How's my girl?</i>
- Fine.
- You wanna go with Stevie?
- Come on.
I'm comin'.
<i>You know that dress I got you</i>
<i>for your birthday?</i>
- Yeah?
<i>- Well, now's your chance to wear it...</i>
<i>'cause I'm taking you</i>
<i>out to dinner tonight.</i>
- What's goin' on?
<i>- A little surprise.</i>
<i>I'm leaving here now.</i>
<i>I'll be home in half an hour.</i>
- Bye-bye.
<i>- Bye, babe.</i>
<i>...I pray the Lord</i>
<i>my soul to keep.</i>
<i>If I should die</i>
<i>before I wake...</i>
<i>I pray the Lord</i>
<i>my soul to take.</i>
God bless Mommy and Daddy...
And me.
Grandma, Aunt Lucy,
Uncle George...
- And me.
- And her.
- Now will you read us a story?
- No, I will not.
- You try and go to sleep, okay?
- Okay.
- Good night, Mommy.
- Good night.
Sharon will be here
while we're gone. Good night.
Mommy, will you come here a minute?
I wanna tell you something.
What is it?
- Come closer.
- What is it?
- I love you.
- I love you too, Beebell.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Sleep good.
Good night.
- Hi, Sharon.
- Hello, Mrs. Lockhart.
I saw your picture in the paper
the other day. Congratulations.
Wasn't that
a terrible picture?
I thought it was nice.
- The kids asleep?
- No, but they will be.
I give about 20 minutes, then go up
and take a peek. But I warn you:
If Stephen sees you, you're
gonna have to read him a story.
Let's go.
Now, I have the number
of the restaurant here...
and you know the number for police
and emergencies is 911?
- You know that, right?
- I'm gonna eat this staircase.
Yes, lord and master.
I'm not
wearing that thing.
- Have a good time.
- Okay. Thank you.
- Good-bye, Sharon.
- Bye-bye.
- Good-bye.
- You got everything, right?
I don't believe it...
district sales manager.
It's about time.
It's about time they recognized you
for what you really are.
You know, I'm going to be
the youngest district sales manager...
in the company's history.
- Does this mean a raise?
- It sure does.
- How much?
- A lot.
Well, how much?
- You are kidding?
- No.
- And a car? Do you get... Yes?
- And a car.
I'm so proud of you.
- Don't you want your food?
- Excuse me.
- Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart?
- Yes?
- There's a phone call for you.
- No. I'll get it.
It's just Sharon, I'm sure.
Eat your dinner.
This way.
Thank you. Hello?
<i>Have you checked the children?</i>
- Someone help us!
- Somebody needs help.
Please. Jill?
- What's happened? What's wrong?
- The phone! That man!
- He's on the phone! He's got my babies!
- Wait.
- What?
- Curt Duncan. He's back.
- He's on the phone?
- He has my babies!
My babies! Please.
It's okay. It's okay, honey.
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello? Sharon? This is Mr. Lockhart.
- What's going on over there?
<i>- Nothing's going on.</i>
- Is everything all right?
<i>- Yes. There's nothing going on.</i>
<i>Everything's fine.</i>
<i>Why? What's the matter?</i>
Sharon, listen
to me very carefully. Look.
If there is a man in the house... if
there's any reason you can't talk...
just answer "yes" over the phone.
If there's any danger
of any kind,just say "yes."
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>What man in the house?</i>
Sharon? Please do me a favor.
Just tell me truthfully:
When was the last time
you checked my children?
<i>About 45 minutes ago.</i>
<i>Everything's fine.</i>
<i>- They were fast asleep.</i>
- Wh...
Sharon, I'm sorry
about the hysterics.
We're leaving the restaurant now. I'll
explain everything when we get back.
Before we hang up, would you
do one more thing for me?
<i>- What?</i>
- Would you go check the children?
- Honey!
<i>- Sure.</i>
- Excuse me. Excuse me, please.
<i>- Hold on.</i>
- What's the problem, sir?
- I'm Stephen Lockhart. Just a second.
Why doesn't he hurry up,
get her to the hospital?
Hello? Mr. Lockhart,
what's the matter?
- What's going on?
- Nothing's going on.
- You all right? What about the phone?
- What phone?
-When we called you from the restaurant.
-Mommy?
When I got back to the phone,
the line was dead.
Go back to sleep.
Was anybody else here tonight?
Is it okay if the police take you home?
I don't want to leave Jill alone.
- Have I done something wrong?
- No. Don't worry about it.
Jill, I'm here.
We're both here.
We're safe now.
Look. If it'll
make you feel any better...
I'll keep it right here
beside me all night long, hmm?
You know I'm a light sleeper
and a damn good shot.
Satisfied?
I'm sorry to be
putting you through all this.
Come on.
Hey, Bert. This report just
came in on that guy, Curt Duncan.
It seems he broke out of the nuthouse
about three weeks ago.
Yeah? You gonna
put this in our report?
Diamonds, Charlie.
Diamonds was led.
Yeah, I think we should put it in.
Maybe this gal did get a call from him.
- Who knows?
- Your lead, Charlie.
What the hell you doin'?
That's a trump.
A card laid
is a card played.
You're right. We'd better leave this
on Ruznik's desk in the morning.
Sorry, fellas. Give 'em all to me.
I've got 'em all.
- Jesus Christ.
- I can't help that.
- Say, can I see this a minute?
- Yeah.
-You guys have a stakeout on this house?
-Yeah.
Bernstein and Waller are checking in
about every 20 minutes or so.
<i>Hello?</i>
Cliff, I think
I got something for you.
Wh... Yes?
Honey,
where'd you get this?
The candy.
Where'd you get the candy?
- Operator, what does that mean?
<i>- I'm sorry, sir.</i>
<i>- That line seems to be disconnected.</i>
- Then why don't I get a recording?
<i>I don't know, sir. Maybe the number</i>
<i>was recently disconnected...</i>
<i>or maybe there's</i>
<i>a temporary malfunction in the wiring.</i>
<i>Could you try it again</i>
<i>in the morning?</i>
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.
You can't see me...
but I had to come back.
Don't you know why?
Your husband's okay.
