Hey Anna, it's Brian.
I've sent you a couple of emails,
I don't know if you've read them, but...
♫ Fight for your right to admire
♫ Gems and jewels
♫ We're all a mess, unhooked life vests
♫ Strutting at the pool
♫ Of man and flesh, and mice and death
♫ Rydell High School
♫ When I walk by, they throw their eyes
♫ Hand me their tools
♫ I'm told this is paradise
♫ Guys wanna put me on like a tie
♫ Thought there’d be more than being worn
♫ It's the oldest compromise
♫ There are worse places to die
♫ Than Paradise
♫ Thick tropic heat, my suit of meat
♫ Plays it cool
♫ Welcome wagon, mask of Nixon
♫ But my love won't move
♫ Try not to smile, inch is a mile
♫ I must be a fool
♫ Cuz I don't know, how to let go
♫ My heart is lewd
♫ I'm told this is paradise
♫ Guys wanna put me on like a tie
♫ Thought there’d be more than being worn
♫ It's the oldest compromise
♫ There are worse places to die
♫ Than paradise ♫
I did not say gray, I did not say beige,
beige is too 90s,
and gray is just way too
2014, I mean, Anna?
Anna!
Bree!
I knew it was you!
Bree, hi.
How are you?
Uh, good, you know, working hard.
I bet.
I was just telling Michael
the other day how glad I am
to be done with all of
that, right Michael?
Michael?
What?
I'm talking to you?
Hmmmm, I'm listening.
Michael.
Anna.
Hi Michael.
Do you have
our wedding pictures?
Ah, Michael!
That is so rude.
At least say hi first.
Hi, do you have our wedding pictures?
Uh, I'm almost done with them.
It's been like a year.
Seven months.
Well it feels like a year.
I've been meaning to
write you about that,
my email has been really messed up.
I am seriously almost done.
It'll be a couple of
days, or a week, tops.
Okay.
So next Friday, wedding pictures.
What time?
I don't know, I'll call you.
Okay.
I'll see you then.
Okay bye.
Oh crap.
Hey Brian.
Anna, I finally caught you,
did you listen to my messages?
Some, I mean you called like 12 times.
Right, sorry about that,
we need to talk about Mom.
You know what, if you
wanna talk about Mom,
can I call you later?
Anna we really
need to talk about this,
the doctors say she's getting worse.
How are the twins?
Good, they're good.
Anna, I need to tell you
Brian I gotta go.
We're selling Mom's house.
When?
Now, or soon.
It's already on the market.
And you weren't gonna tell me?
I've been trying, this
thing's progressing faster
than we thought and Mom
wants to call the shots
while she still can, so, she
stepped down from the bench
and she has decided to
move into assisted living
on her own terms.
Wait, you know what,
you know what I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked,
I don't wanna talk about this.
You know what, I'm okay with
whatever you decide to do,
you know, sell the house, whatever.
Anna come on, don't be like that.
No, really, I mean, you know, it sounds
like you've got it under control.
Well I don't,
work's insane, which means
Jill's already pissed
at me for not spending
enough time at home.
I can't pack up the house
and move Mom by myself.
So you'll hire someone.
Or you could come home and help.
Brian, Mom and I are not...
Anna she's sick, and
she's only gonna get worse.
Come home and help out, she uh,
I really think she would appreciate it.
I doubt it.
I could really use the help.
I can't, I'm sorry.
Anna, come on.
I never ask you to do things like this
but I really need you to
step up this time, please.
Thanks Karen.
Anna?
Okay.
Okay, is that a "Yes,
you'll come home?".
Yes, yes I'll come.
Yes, thank you, I really appreciate it.
I'll tell Mom, she'll be excited.
Right.
Um, are you gonna be around
after work to talk details?
I guess.
Great, uh, thanks again Anna.
Shit.
♫ Bring me
♫ Home
♫ Bring me
♫ Home
♫ Bring me
♫ Home
♫ Bring me
♫ Home ♫
Daddy wait!
I'm coming with you.
Oh, not today, bug.
I love you so much.
And I'll see you this weekend okay?
In the meantime...
Keep an eye on things okay?
I love you.
So I can be New York
for that deposition,
but book the earliest flight back.
Thanks Mom, I just wanna be in and out.
Oh there she is, Karen
I gotta call you back.
Hi sorry I'm late.
Not a problem.
It's great to see you.
It's good to see you too.
Is everything okay?
Yeah I just took the scenic route.
Mom, Anna's here.
Anna's in Chicago.
Well actually.
Hi Mom.
Anna!
What are you doing here?
I'm here to help you move.
We're selling the house.
Oh please Anna, I'm not that
far gone, I know I'm selling
the house, you didn't have
to come all the way up here,
Brian and I've got
everything under control.
Actually Mom, we talked about this.
We thought we could use some extra help.
But honey I thought
we agreed that Anna was
the wrong person for the job.
She's got her hands full
getting her own life together
right now.
I can hear you.
I know.
Now Brian I think we just need to let Anna
focus on finding her career.
I have a career.
Art is not a career
sweetheart, art is a hobby,
Brian has a career.
Mom, didn't you say you had some emails
that you wanted to take care of?
Yes I do.
Great, so why don't you
take care of those now
and I will show Anna where
we're at with the packing
and how the schedule works.
Brian there's no need to...
When, when you talk down to someone.
Condescend?
Condescend, if you and your
sister wanna take some time
to talk about me behind
my back, just say so,
I have plenty of work to do.
Okay, we need to time to talk
about you behind your back.
I'll be in my office.
I told you this was a bad idea.
We'll be fine.
She's still working?
Ish, every firm in
town wants her to join
as an advisory partner.
It's really move a gesture
than an actual job,
but she's taking the
decision pretty seriously.
I take it they don't know about the
No, not yet, she's pretty ferocious
when it comes to her privacy.
Damn, I gotta go to the office, so,
Mom's meds are in the
cabinet next to the fridge,
she takes two Memantine...
Meman what?
And uh, no smoking in the house.
I don't smoke anymore.
Great.
It's really nice seeing
you, it's been a long time.
The Harriet Herald.
Okay well, I finished the story,
so all we needed to do
is take some new pictures
for the Tomato Series, then
the whole newsletter is done.
I can take those pictures now.
Thanks, all right, I gotta
go, I have a baseball game
at four.
Oh, I thought that we could
take the pictures together.
Can't, but you could come
to my game later if you want.
Totally, I mean, if I can.
Great, see you there banana.
See ya!
Dear Anna, I hope you don't mind
that I planted my mailbox in your garden.
I'm a little lonely, and I'm
hoping to grow a friendship.
I really like books,
swimming, and s'mores!
What about you?
Your friend?
I never did do anything with this room.
What were you gonna do?
I don't know, something.
Oh you're unpacking that's
good, are you hungry?
A little.
Well finish up here
then come downstairs,
I'll make you a snack and
we can go over the list.
List?
Yes.
Triangles or squares?
Squares.
Here we go.
Glassware. Wrap three
times with newspaper,
once loosely, once tightly,
once loosely again.
Pack vertically in a small glass wine box,
this is a pretty detailed list.
Less opportunity for error.
China.
Wrap three times in newspaper,
once loosely, once tightly,
once loosely again.
Place one piece of
cardboard between each item,
pack carefully in China box.
Plates. Wrap each plate three
times with bubble wrap insert.
Time to turn the light out.
Mom.
We've got a big day
ahead of us tomorrow.
Are you kidding me?
Anna?
Hmm?
Annabanana!
Oh, hi!
It's good to see you.
You too, what are you doing here?
Oh Brian didn't tell
you, I'm your realtor.
No way for real?
Yeah for real, yeah I
got a card and everything,
I got a second showing
upstairs as we speak.
Oh I totally forgot, is my mom...
No, she's at lunch with Brian.
Okay, well I can get outta here too.
No, no it's okay,
they're big on discussing.
Okay.
I'm really excited about all
the interest in this place.
But I gotta tell you I'm kinda
bummed you're selling it.
I have a lot of great
memories of this house.
I think I spent more
time with you back here
than I did on my own.
I guess that's true, I mean,
at least in our newsletter days.
Newsletter,
right, the Harriet uh...
Harriet Herald.
Yes!
Bringing the
news of the neighborhood
to your doorstep!
Wow we really were pretty
big dorks back then weren't we?
We really were.
Yeah, so um, how's Chicago,
are you still taking pictures?
Yup, yeah, I'm...
Tim!
Yeah uh, yeah I'll be right up.
Well that's my cue.
It's great to see you, so
uh, how long are you in town?
Oh you know, till we're all packed up.
Oh great, we should
together and have a drink
sometime soon.
Yeah, I would love to.
Cool.
Tim, we're ready to go.
Right, uh yeah let's
actually, let's head out back.
I'll be in touch.
Dear Dragonfly,
do you think love always has to end?
I think that I might be in
love with my best friend,
but I'm worried that I'll
mess up our friendship.
Hey, are you spying on me?
No, calm down I was
just watching you write
your love letter to your Dragonfly.
It's not a love letter.
Then why are you writing to him?
I don't know.
It's fun, it's a mystery!
He understands about stuff,
stuff no one else understands.
No one else?
Fine.
Hey, where are you going?
You're busy, and I've
got other things to do.
Tim!
Later banana!
Love sucks.
Do you wanna do this part Mom?
No, I just wanna make
sure that everything
goes in the box the right way.
You know you could have the
movers do this part later
it's pretty straightforward.
Not to everyone.
Come on in, the door is open.
Hi Daddy!
Bug!
Let me look at you, still gorgeous.
Daddy please I'm a mess.
A man's entitled to his opinion.
So can I get you something?
Beer, wine?
It's 11 AM.
And your point is?
I'll take a beer.
That's my girl, let me
know what you think of this.
It's a Minnesota brew, I've
been trying to buy local
and all that.
So?
It's good, it's the same
place as the Lonely Blonde beer
you sent me.
Good girl, you bet'cha.
Check out the label on that.
Sweet Child of Vine, cute.
I thought you'd appreciate that.
So I should read into
Lonely Blonde then too huh?
I just wanna see my baby happy.
I'm happy Dad.
Really?
Yeah, really.
You know, maybe not at this
exact moment in my life,
living at home with a mother
who just oozes disappointment.
But you know, besides
that, sure I'm happy.
Yeah you totally sound like it.
I don't know it's weird.
You know if I didn't know Mom was sick,
I would have no idea, she's so...
Intense?
That's a nice way to put it.
But you know what bug, go easy on her,
this thing that she's got, it's no joke.
Yeah, yeah I know.
How do you like the tomatoes?
Look good.
I thought so.
So how is work outside of the garden?
Oh it's fine, work's
work, I'd rather play.
Well you can't be doing
too bad, new downtown loft.
Yeah, commercial work's
good for paying the bills.
I could actually use
a little bit of that,
do you think I could tag along
next time, learn the ropes?
No, you're too good for
that, I'm proud of you,
struggling not selling out.
You put your own value on your work.
Yeah but...
No yeah but.
You've got magic, you honor that.
Do you want some hummus?
No I'm good.
Okay.
It's super garlicky.
And you know I've,
always heard that the garlic
is really hearthealthy.
But then I was reading this thing,
it actually doesn't make any
difference, but if you feel
better, than you've got a healthier heart.
I got it in here somewhere.
I've got tapenade too, if you'd rather
have something like that.

You jumped right in front of my car.
I have the right to
cross in front of my house.
What is going
on Mom, are you okay?
Yes I'm okay, no thanks to this maniac,
he almost hit me with his car.
Yeah it's a miracle I
didn't, she practically
jumped in front of my car.
Whose fault is that, this
is a quiet neighborhood,
this is not a...
I have friends in the police department
and they will be...
Good, go ahead and
call them, I'll tell them
what happened.
Hey, hey there's no need
to involve the police,
let's all just calm down,
Mom, why don't you go inside
and cool off.
I don't need to cool
off Anna, and I don't need
your help, now go to your room.
Hah, is she always like this.
Excuse me?
Mom just let me take care of this, okay?
Listen she has early on set Alzheimer's
Anna!
My son is an excellent
attorney, expect to hear
from him shortly.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right, I didn't
realize she was sick.
You know keep an eye on her,
it could've been really bad.
Tough crossword?
No, it's a real disappointment actually.
The crossword?
Yes, you'd think you could
count on the New York Times
at least for quality and
consistency, but this is really...
This is really unacceptable.
Can I help?
I don't see how, it's wrong.
18 down, hearsay, five
letters beginning with R.
There's no such word!
Maybe you're just having
a hard time thinking of it.
I'm not having a hard
time thinking of it,
it doesn't exist, I should know.
Rumor?
Excuse me?
Five down, starts with an R.
Rumor?
Rumor isn't hearsay,
hearsay is testimony
given by a witness
based on what they heard
rather than what they, they uh...
I'll uhm, try it though.
You need a...
A what?
For under your cup of coffee, a...
A coaster.
Sorry about that.
That's all right.
Are you gonna get that?
No, it's okay.
A friend?
Client actually.
You should take it.
How's the wedding photography going?
Okay I guess, I mean,
it's just a money job.
What isn't, if you don't
make money it isn't a job.
Right.
I'm actually trying to sell
some of my own pictures.
Really?
Good girl.
To magazines?
Uh, no, no my work's
not commercial like that.
Um, I'm actually
looking at art galleries,
like there's this coffee shop right by me
that's really interesting.
Coffee shop, that's not serious,
I thought you were being serious.
I am, they feature a
new artist every month...
Coffee shop is not serious,
now the wedding photography
that could be something, I mean
what about that big wedding
you shot, that was, haven't
you gotten any uhm...
Referrals?
Referrals, have you gotten
any referrals from that?
Not yet, I'm still finishing
up their photographs.
Anna that wedding was months ago!
I know, I'm really focusing
on doing my own work.
No you're not, you're
procrastinating, you're...
Your responsibility, you are
shirking your responsibility.
Your father does that.
It's a habit, and it's a bad one.
You don't know, you're not there.
The evidence is plain.
What evidence, I'm not on trial.
Well if you were.
What, you'd find me guilty?
Yeah I already know that.
Where are you going?
You know I'm not 10 anymore
I don't have to stay for this.
So you're just gonna run away again?
You know I wish that
just once you would trust
that I know what I'm doing.
Trust has to be earned Anna.
How?
You are a grown woman.
It is time to take
responsibility for the, the...
That you accept
responsibility for the, the...
I like the composition
on this one, but there's
not enough light, do you see what I mean?
I guess, but, how do I fix
that, it's not like I can
turn up the sun.
No, but you could aperture
a little, or you could
leave the lens open...
Dad, I'm shooting with this.
Hey I'm sorry bug, it's
just that you're taking
such good pictures I keep forgetting
that you're shooting with
that piece of shit camera.
Dad!
Sorry, piece of crap camera.
We're just gonna have to
get you a real camera.
Seriously?
Seriously.
Yes!
I'm home!
Well that's my cue.
No Daddy don't go, stay
just a little bit longer.
I wish I could bug.
There you are, where's your brother?
Hello Phil.
Hello Claire, I was just leaving.
No Daddy stay for dinner.
Tell him he can stay for dinner, Mom.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
But Mom!
I'm sorry Anna, my decision is final.
You'll have dinner with your
dad at his house this weekend.
It's a condo, not a house.
At his condo then.
I wish I could stay at
your condo all the time.
Me too, bug.
Dad said I could get a new camera.
Did he?
We'll discuss it.
You don't have to discuss
it, because Dad said
I could already get one.
She has real talent Claire.
I'm sure she does.
Just like she had talent for
painting, and ice skating,
and the drums for that matter.
Then the moment we buy
her an expensive piece
of equipment, she forgets
all about it and she's on
to the next thing, we've
talked about this Phil.
This is not like that.
This is different Claire,
photography is in her blood.
So is having a hard
time with commitment.
She doesn't have a hard
time with commitment,
she needs to find something
that she feels passionate
about and then have somebody
trust her and support her.
I support her, I have a real job
where I work all day
every day, to support her
and her brother.
And I don't?
This is not about you Phil.
The hell it isn't!
You're unbelievable Claire.
Just keep pushing, you're
gonna drive her away too.
Your opinion is noted,
you may leave now.
You can't dismiss me,
this isn't your courtroom.
No it's my home, and
if I remember correctly,
you know how to see yourself out.
You ruin everything.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Dinner in five minutes,
I picked up Chinese food
and got the egg rolls you love.
I'm not hungry.
You may leave now.
Where are you going?
To Dad's, I assume you'll be all right.
Of course.
Great, just try and
stay out of the street.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault, it's just,
you know sometimes I'm
thankful when she can't find
the words, the ones she has hurt enough.
Careful bug, you don't
wanna say something
you're gonna regret later.
Well I found some things
that I wanna show you.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
This.
Oh my God!
Boy, that brings back
memories, I can't believe
I made you shoot with this piece of shit.
Hey I loved that piece of shit.
Yes you did.
And this.
What is it?
You tell me.
Oh.
Uh
May I?
Of course.
"Dear Anna, I'm glad
we have each other too.
Sometimes I feel lonelier
when I'm surrounded by other
people than when I'm actually by myself.
Sometimes being with people
who don't understand you
can be worse than being by yourself."
Who wrote this?
You.
What?
Dad, please, I
just wanna say thank you.
These letters meant so much
to me, when you left...
I was really lonely.
But then getting these letters and knowing
there was still someone
around who understood me,
someone I could talk to.
It really helped.
Bug.
I love you so much.
But I didn't write this.
Dad, come on.
Who else would come up with the idea
to grow a magical mailbox in a garden.
It grew in the garden? Dude that's cool.
I don't know what do say.
I wish I wrote 'em.
But honestly I didn't, I'm sorry.
No it's okay, it's just,
you know if it wasn't you,
who was it, God, I'm lucky
I didn't end up on the back
of a milk carton.
It really wasn't you?
No it really wasn't.
Hey don't worry though, we'll
get to the bottom of this.
Oh and by the way, you
know, I've got something
that I wanted to ask you too.
Yeah?
Yeah, I've met this woman,
do you think that 30 is too
young for me to be dating?
Daddy gross!
What, oh I've got a better picture.
Gross!
I could use a hand here.
I'm on break.
That works out well for you.
It does today!
Brian, you're in my light.
I'm so sorry.
Hey banana.
Hi.
Flowers?
Oh they're for your mom we
are officially in contract now.
Right, congrats.
You too.
Thanks, I guess.
That thing is still here?
Do you remember that?
Of course, you're the only person I know
who tried to grow tomatoes
and grew a mailbox instead.
Hey, hey I grew tomatoes too.
Yeah you know I was
actually really jealous
of that mailbox.
Yeah?
You had a mysterious
pen pal, that's like every
10-year-old's dream.
Right.
So I gotta know, who was it?
Honestly?
Hmmmm.
I don't know.
Come on.
Really.
So it's still a mystery?
I kinda love that.
Yeah?
Yeah.
That's because you don't have to think
about some freaky psychopath
stalking you as a child.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
It was obviously somebody
that cared about you a lot.
In a non, freaky sort of way.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So I'm going to this thing on Friday night
at an art gallery in Northeast.
Some friends of mine are
having a big opening,
would you wanna come?
Yeah, I mean, yeah, if I can.
Great, I'll text you the details.
Okay.
I should go deliver these.
Wait, smile.
How was it?
Good.
Bye banana.
Hi there.
Hey.
Oh an old 110.
What do you have on
there, the moon landing?
I don't know.
♫ Baby tell me
♫ What's on your mind
♫ Don't assume
♫ That I am blind
♫ Baby, tell me, tell me, tell me
♫ What's on your mind ♫
You look beautiful.
Thanks Mom.
I made a list, I thought
we could go through it
when you get home tonight.
Mom you already gave me that list.
No I didn't.
Mom you did, we've been
using to pack for two weeks.
We have?
Of course, of course
we have, I just wanted
to double check and make sure
we'd gone over it together.
Are you sure you're okay,
do you need me to stick
around tonight?
Don't be ridiculous.
You're sure?
Yes, Anna, I'm sure,
I'm not a child who needs
to be babysat, I'm fine.
Okay, I'm just asking.
And make sure you're home by midnight,
your curfew is still...
Intact.
Enjoy yourself.
Anna you look, wow.
Thank you, so do you.
It's so good to see you.
I haven't been able to
stop thinking about you.
Really?
Yes, seeing you in the
garden, talking about
my letters, it was like a dream.
Your letters?
Of course.
You didn't know?
I was too shy to tell
you how I felt back then,
so I had to write it.
I have been waiting all this time.
For me to figure it out.
For you.
Excuse me.
Anna you look, wow.
Thank you, so do you.
Anna this is Ayla,
and this is her gallery.
Oh, oh I thought...
Never mind.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
I'm always a little suspect
of the word beautiful,
it's so, weighted down with
heteronormative expectations,
but I think I know what you mean.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Tim says that you two grew up together.
Yeah, um
I gave Anna her first gig.
The Harriet Herald.
It was a neighbourhood newsletter.
And now Anna is a real photographer.
Really, what's the focus of your work?
Oh I don't know that, I'm not that focused.
Ironic right?
Photographer who has a hard time to focus.
Anyway, um I actually illustrate
over the photographs
that I take to change the
feel or the focus of a scene.
That's so interesting.
Maybe we could have a
couple of your pieces here.
What do you think babe?
That is an amazing
idea, you are so sweet.
Oh...
Sorry.
I forgot where
I was for a minute.
So uhm, I'm sorry, you guys are?
Oh, Sam and Steve are here, they're two
of our biggest supporters, do
you mind if I steal Tim away
for just a minute to say hello.
Sure.
I'll just be a minute,
I'm so glad you're here,
it means a lot.
Of course.
Red or white?
Yes.
It's beautiful isn't it?
That's what I said.
So that takes us to
like eighth grade right,
and eighth grade is when it really got bad
because that's when Betsy
showed up into the picture,
and once Betsy was in the
picture, he stopped talking
to me pretty much altogether
because she didn't
want me at their lunch
table, which was like,
hey, do you guys know Brad.
It's Matt.
Brad is a great listener.
Say hi, Brad.
Hi, can I get you anything?
A beer.
Don't you think it's beautiful.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure what's up.
I know.
What do you mean?
I know you wrote the letters.
Anna, have you been having
a little too much to drink?
Yes, but that's not why I'm saying this.
Banana...
No, I, I know you
wrote the letters because
you're scared to tell me that you love me,
so I'm gonna tell you first.
Tim, I love yo...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Anna.
I don't think we're on the same page here.
No, Tim we are.
We are, we're the same.
You know, you uh, you
don't wanna be a realtor.
You wanna be a journalist.
I don't wanna take pictures
of other people's weddings.
We, um, we had big dreams and
we compromised because
we were scared of failing,
but we don't have to be scared
of this, I love you Tim.
I love you.
And I've got a box full
of letters that say
you love me too.
Anna, I...
Tim!
No, no, I, look, I...
I did not write those letters, I didn't.
But I do love you Anna,
I do, and I always will,
just as a friend, okay?
No.
No, not okay.
Tim you love me, please.
Anna I'm, I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no, no sorry!
No this isn't happening,
this is, this is not real.
Let me drive you home.
No!
No this isn't happening,
this isn't real, no, no.
No, no, no, no to that.
No to you.
No to you, no to you.
No, no to this exhibit.
Let me drive you...
No!
No.
Oh God...
Ow!
Mom?
Mom?
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, Mom!
Here's the living room.
Nice railings they were a
custom design, rod iron,
we have the dining room right
here with newly painted walls.
Mom!
We used it in the kitchen as well.
Oh you're not my mom.
No.
Anna this is Tammi, our realtor.
What are you talking
about, Tim is our realtor.
Tim was our realtor,
he called this morning
and said that he didn't think it would
be appropriate to work with us any longer.
He did not.
He did, did he say
anything to you about it?
Whatever it was, it
must've been pretty bad
because he's leaving a huge
commission on the table.
It's not actually that big
a deal, I've had this happen
several times before, and I am thrilled
to help you close this deal.
There are just a few
things we need to go over...
Tammi, I'm sorry Tammi is it?
Tim should be the one doing
this, I didn't mean to...
He shouldn't have to...
Are you okay?
Is your sister also?
Tammi could you give us a minute?
Of course, I'll just
head into the kitchen.
Great.
What's going on?
You look awful, did you
sleep in that dress?
No, yes.
I gotta go.
Anna no hang on, you
can't just keep leaving,
we have work to do, where's Mom?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
I mean I just woke
up and she's not here.
Are you kidding me?
When did you last see her?
I don't know, last night before I left.
You left her alone in
the house last night?
Yeah, she said she'd be fine.
She said she'd be fine?
What the hell Anna!
Why do you think you're here?
She's not fine.
She's never going to be fine again.
I know, I'm sorry, what
do you want me to say?
I don't want you to say
anything, I want you to step up
and actually do something.
Well I'm here, aren't I?
Yes to take care of our
mother, not the other way around.
She has never taken care of me.
Are you kidding me?
Ever since their divorce it's
been all about taking care
of Anna all the time.
It has never been about me.
It's always about you.
It is not.
Wake up Anna!
Do you remember my eighth birthday?
It was a slumber party.
Not really.
Do you remember that time you ran away?
Yeah.
Same night.
When Mom couldn't find you,
all of my friends' parents
came at like 11 o'clock
at night to pick them up
so we could go searching for you.
I cried myself to sleep
in the back of the car.
Because I ruined your birthday.
No, because I was worried about you.
Brian, I'm sorry, I need...
I don't care about
what you need anymore.
I care about finding Mom.
Okay I'm coming with you.
No, I think
you've done enough already.
No.
You left the water running.
You wanna be careful
about things like that.
You don't want a flood
before closing now, do we?
Hello?
You left her
alone in the house last night?
We have?
She's never
going to be fine again.
Your responsibility, you're
shirking, you are shirking
your responsibility.
Why do you think you're here?
I don't need to cool
off Anna, and I don't
need your help, now go to your room.
Do you
remember my eighth birthday?
Do you remember that time you ran away?
Anna?
Anna!
Mom, Mom!
Where have you been?
You missed your curfew.
Mom I'm not a kid anymore,
I, I didn't run away.
You always run away.
Because you push me.
I'm trying to protect you.
From what?
From me.
When your father...
You were so angry with
me, I tried to talk to you
I tried to be with you, but, I
didn't know what I was doing.
You blamed me when your father left.
And...
I blame myself.
I failed, and when you
ran away, I failed again.
I failed at being a
mother just like I failed
at being a wife.
I'm not asking for sympathy,
I just, I'm trying,
to explain this to you while I still can.
I loved you.
I love you.
I was trying to show you...
Mom!
Mom!
Brian.
What are you doing here?
I didn't know how to get home.
Moon landing right?
Right.
Have a good one.
Thanks.
Hey Anna.
Have you been
playing with my mailbox?
No.
Are you lying?
No.
I told you not to play with my mailbox,
it's private!
I didn't touch your
stupid mailbox, but not just
because it's yours, because
it's a federal offense
to tamper someone else's mail.
Nerd.
Anna?
Yeah?
Are you okay?
Why wouldn't I be okay?
You ran away.
So, big deal, kids
run away all the time.
Are you gonna do it again?
I don't know, maybe.
Don't, it scared me, and
it made Mom really sad.
Whatever.
Be careful now, don't drop that.
I'm not gonna drop it Mom.
Jesus this thing must
way a thousand pounds!
Don't use hyperbole
Brian, it's unnecessary.
Can I help you Mom?
No, I'm losing my mind, not my balance.
Here you go Mom.
Thank you, oh.
I remembered.
I packed you, oh shoot.
For the road, I packed...
Snacks?
PB&J.
Thanks Mom.
You're welcome, drive safely.
I will.
Take care of yourself.
I'll do my best.
You're it!
Take care.
Hang on, just a second
I made you something.
You did?
Yeah it's not like a
big thing or anything,
but uh, here you go.
Wow.
I hope it's okay.
Yeah, I mean.
It's more than okay, this is uh...
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hug the twins for me.
Will do.
Thanks again.
You're welcome.

Miss Larsen.
Of course
I'm sorry, Miss Larsen.
Thank you.
Oh and I almost forgot,
this came for you earlier today.
Thank you.
Dear Dragonfly.
The winds of change are
blowing hard here in Chicago.
You'll be happy to know
that I actually finished
those weddings photographs,
and I think that even
Michael liked them.
We love them, love them!
And you were
right, it felt really good
to commit to the project and
see it through to the end.
Okay, bye!
That said, I
think this was my last wedding,
at least for a while, I'm
still hoping for that coffee
shop show, and I've been
doing a lot of paintings,
so that I'm prepared.
How's your new home?
I hope that the space feels
like your own and that you like
your new neighbors.
Brian said that the twins
love visiting and swimming
in the pool, pretty swanky.
I'm excited to come back
for Thanksgiving and see it
for myself.
With love, your daughter Anna.
