Wakey! Wakey!
Rise and shine!
Come on! Now!
That is it. Come on!
Move along.
Come on! Quickly now!
12 YEARS LATER
LONDON. WORLD WAR II
Peter! We will miss
the breakfast.
The heroes have risen.
They must now feed!
<i>Quiet over there!</i>
<I>I said quiet!</I>
<I>Eat that up! Now!</I>
<I>I will not tell you again!</I>
Where is the bacon?
We always have bacon
rind of a weekend.
There is a war on, Peter.
Rationing.
You are lucky to have
any food at all.
Mother Barnabas, forgive me.
Get over there.
How much you want to bet.
She is nicking all the rations.
She will hear you.
She has got ears
like an elephant.
Bum like one, too.
Look!
More empty seats.
Nelson and Billy both
have been evacuating.
Lucky sods.
Both of them?
- When?
<i>- I do not know.</i>
When I woke up,
they were both gone.
Off to some family in Canada
until the war is over.
I would not mind going there.
Do not be daft.
You have to stay put.
For when our moms
come fetch us.
Exactly.
We hunker down here.
Hold the fort.
Wait for the cavalry.
Now! Get on that roof and
clean those filthy gutters.
<i>Is it safe, Mother Barnabas?</i>
Well! I have not
tested it myself, like.
You know, not recently.
<i>But all the necessary
paperwork is in order.</i>
Should an orphan
perish in a fall.
Now! Get up there!
<i>While you are aloft,
and closer to our Lord.</i>
You may reflect on
your festering souls.
Your souls that fester
as do the leaves.
See! I was right!
She is hoarding
all the rations.
Where is she hiding
all the grub?
Her office.
No one has ever been in there.
I heard a rumor.
It is booby-trapped.
Silence, I said! Quiet!
Everyone, down to
the shelters!
In chaos is death!
- Come on!
- I do not like this.
Fort Knox.
The lair of the dragon.
Whoa!
Come here.
So, put your hands there.
I need your shoe, fella.
- Could you just...
- Quiet!
Right.
Nineteen.
Twenty.
Peter.
Ugh! What a dirty old nun.
Ugh!
<i>This is so unhygienic.</i>
<i>Why is the Virgin Mary
so clean?</i>
- Nibs?
<i>- Down here!</i>
Nibs!
I told you.
Booby-trapped.
It is a treasure trove.
<i>Flipping heck!</i>
Peter!
It is the records.
Peter!
It is your file.
<i>Is it from your mom?</i>
<i>What does she say?</i>
<i>I cannot.</i>
Will you read it?
I meant aloud.
<i>"My dearest Peter."</i>
<i>"Everything I have done."</i>
<i>"I have done
because I love you."</i>
<i>"I long for the day that
I will come back for you."</i>
<i>"And explain everything."</i>
"Do not doubt me."
"Nor most importantly."
"Do not doubt yourself."
"You are extraordinary."
<i>"More than you can imagine."</i>
<i>I promise that
you will see me again.</i>
<i>In this world or another.</i>
Come on!
That is my private property!
Give it back!
You know, Peter, every little
orphan dreams he is special.
That he will be the one.
Whose mother comes?
A-skipping back for him.
However, your mom is
not for skipping.
And, why is that?
Because you are not
special, Peter.
<i>You are not even special.</i>
In your own way.
You are just a nasty
little creature.
Abandoned by a feckless mom.
Who has forgotten you exist.
You little savage!
Hands! The both of you!
He never did anything!
He is guilty by association.
It is time.
For the pine.
Hi. Skinny.
Arnold and the twins,
When did they go?
My guess, it were last night.
All the missing children.
All that dough
hidden in her office.
What is Barnabas up to?
She is selling orphans.
I knew it!
I mean, is she?
That is not nice.
But who in the world
buys orphans at night.
That is what
we have to find out.
<i>Now! Come on! Let us make
a plan. It will be fun.</i>
<i>I have heard that one before.</i>
Who guffed one?
<i>Nibs!</i>
I never.
This was a stupid plan.
I am going back to bed.
<i>Come on!</i>
- Night.
- Night.
- Nibs!
<i>- Peter!</i>
I told you. It would
happen tonight.
I was right!
What?
Head for the stairs.
Go!
Nibs!
Goodbye, Peter!
- You are coming with me!
- Let us go!
Peter.
Holy pudding!
Prepare to set sail!
We have to get out of here.
<i>We will have to jump.</i>
I cannot!
<i>We will have to!</i>
Come on!
Nibs!
And, away we go!
Come on!
Friends until death!
Peter!
Damn it. You have
sunk my frigate.
Ma'am. Luftwaffe. Inbound.
Ladies.
Sector 6, sector 8, sector 12.
<i>Incoming!</i>
Spitfire!
<i>- Clear the deck!
- Ready your swords!</i>
Come on!
Ma'am, regarding identification,
<i>of the enemy, aircraft,</i>
<i>it rather resembles a...</i>
Spit it out, man.
<i>It looks like a pirate ship,
ma'am.</i>
Come again.
Fire!
Whoa!
Get off.
<i>Do not go dying.</i>
You are precious cargo.
- Am I?
- Somebody thinks so.
Is it my mother?
Going up!
Whoa!
Get out here! You little rat!
Make your move!
<i>Come on! Hurry up!</i>
Move it! Come on!
<i>Right this ship for docking.</i>
<i>Haul away!</i>
Come on! Fellas.
Look! It is daylight.
I want to see this!
- What is that?
- Move. I cannot see.

Sweet! Gentle children.
You weep molten pearls
of innocent tears.
Dry them, dear nippers.
I have sprung you
from life is cruel dungeon.
And, hereby grant
you liberty!
Suffer no more.
Come unto me. You are home.
Here you join orphans alike.
From every corner of the globe.
Every race, creed, and color.
<i>Every age and era.</i>
<i>You are pioneers.</i>
Brave creators of
a new society.
For this…
My poppets, is a land
of opportunity!
My justice is divine.
My laws are so simple.
You could write them
on a pig's ear.
In fact! I have.
Law: Number one.
<i>"Those who work with bright,
honest vigor."</i>
<i>"Will be rewarded
with prizes."</i>
"And trophies."
"And confectionery!"
<i>Law: Number two.</i>
"Those who fail
to work hard."
"Those who skive or malinger."
"Will hereby know the brooding
majesty of my disapproval."
<i>Mark me well.</i>
I know no pity.
No second chances.
I do not do mercy.
However, remember…
Do not forget
to help yourselves.
Lots and lots
of jolly old fun!
Hey! Kiddie winks.
Welcome to Neverland!
<i>Put some effort into it.</i>
<i>You would better find
me some Pixum!</i>
<i>Harder! Work harder!</i>
Sam Smiegel, supervisor.
No. Thank you. Take it off.
- Whoa!
- Excuse me.
What for is we digging.
Did no one explain?
We are mining…
For these little chaps.
Fairy dust, otherwise
known as Pixum.
Fairies are real!
They were real. Yeah.
There were millions of them
all over the island.
What happened to them?
Blackbeard hunted them
into extinction.
- Why?
<i>- For the fairy dust.</i>
You know. The old Pixum.
What for does he want it?
I do not have any idea.
No one knows. No one has
allowed to know.
Well! You best not
dwell on it. Just...
<i>Get and move on!</i>
Real! Actual fairies.
<i>Hey! New kid.</i>
You just got here
on a flying pirate ship.
"Real" should be a very fluid
concept for you right now.
Get to digging.
Give me your pick. Kid.
Your hand has all messed up.
Because your blade is blunted.
If you keep swinging
like that…
You are going to
break your wrist.
I am Peter.
How long have you been here?
Forever.
Do you know why they want it?
So badly. The Pixum?
You ask too many
questions. Kid.
They kill for it. We die for it.
End of the story.
- Thank you very much.
<i>- Do not thank me.</i>
I do not care about you.
<i>I am not your friend.</i>
And, I do not have your back.
Simple as that.
Shoo! Kid.
Fairy dust.
I found some of it.
That is mine!
No!
I found some it!
Thief! I found it!
Hi. Small fry, button it.
Move!
Give it to me.
It was mine!
I found the fairy Pixum!
This bogey stole it.
<i>He said he found it.</i>
That means he found it. Clear.
Clear as the scar
on your ugly face!
<i>Take him…</i>
To the Captain!
Disorder and verbal.
Move out of the way. Move it.
Get out of the way!
There... There is a procedure
for this. You know.
You have not supposed to...
Shut it, Mr. Clipboard.
Let us see what
Blackbeard makes…
Of this nasty little thief.
What are you looking at?
I was trying my best.
<i>Well! Go on, then.
Back to work. Thank you.</i>
Did you find the
natives' camp?
They found us. Sir.
They sprang from the trees.
And, laid waste to 40 of our
most formidable men.
Then they disappeared…
Back into the forest.
As if, they were never there.
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- We will get them. Captain.
Given the proper time.
Time?
I have sucked
these mines dry.
There is almost nothing left.
I must have their lands.
However, these savages…
Continue to ambush my ships.
Operating from
some hidden camp.
Which no one
can seem to find…
Yet you assure me all will
be given the proper time.
There is no time! None!
Excuse me. Captain.
Hey! Ho.
The show must go on.
How do the miners seem?
Dirty, feverish, on the
brink of collapse. Sir.
Why must it be so hard?
So...
Whom are we making
an example today?
<i>♪ Hey ho, let us go! ♪</i>
<i>♪ Hey ho, let us go! ♪</i>
<i>♪ They are forming
in a straight line. ♪</i>
<i>♪ They are going through
a tight wind. ♪</i>
No! No!
What is going on?
What do you think?
<i>♪ They are piling
in the backseat. ♪</i>
<i>♪ They are generating
steam heat. ♪</i>
<i>♪ Pulsating to
the back beat. ♪</i>
<i>♪ The Blitzkrieg Bop. ♪</i>
Any clearer now?
<i>♪ Hey ho, let us go! ♪</i>
<i>♪ Hey! Ho, let us go! ♪</i>
Yeah!
Brave heroes of Neverland.
Behold these traitors.
<i>I entrust their fate
to your gracious whim.</i>
This barbarian...
Caught stealing from
the grain store.
Was caught squealing?
From the grain store.
Stealing.
- Stealing.
- Twice.
Twice!
- Will you spare him?
<i>- No!</i>
Or, do you lust for justice?
Justice!
- Yes!
- Justice!
- Do they ever have mercy?
- Yes! They do.
Often?
Let us go!
Do not answer that.
This boy has been in
our mines but one day…
And, he has already proven
himself to be a thief.
<i>A rabble sourer.</i>
And, a Pixum fraudster.
- I never!
<i>- I ask…</i>
Shall you have mercy?
For the willful child?
<i>No!</i>
Or, do you be nasty?
<i>Nasty!</i>
Nasty! Nasty! Nasty!
<i>Alack!</i>
The people have spoken.
Think a happy thought.
I will have be darned.
I do not believe it!
I can fly!
<i>Neverland is a dream.</i>
From which you never wake.
Ever had that one?
A dreadful nightmare
you know is not real.
However, your sleep is so heavy…
So, deep, so delicious…
That you just cannot wake up.
<i>Drowning in sleep.</i>
<i>Slow dream.</i>
Drowning in the
soft, black sea.
Do you know that sea? Peter.
<i>It is death. Boy.</i>
Murmuring to you.
It is where we end.
Most of us.
Would you like
some chocolate?
Childhood is not so jolly.
In fact. It is rather
frightening.
Agree?
Are you brave? Peter.
I try to be.
Yes! Of course!
Are you scared?
Yes.
Have you ever flown before?
No.
Beyond that wall.
There are savage people.
<i>They have an
ancient prophecy.</i>
<i>From when the fairy kingdoms
reigned on this island.</i>
The prophecy tells of a boy
born of the love.
Between a fairy prince
and a human girl.
<i>A boy who would be
disappeared from this world.</i>
Until he was old enough…
To return and lead
an uprising against me.
A boy, so says the prophecy…
Who could fly?
Have you come
to kill me? Peter.
I do not believe in
bedtime stories.
<i>"I... I."</i>
<i>I promise that.
You will see me again.</i>
<i>In this world or another.</i>
"Or another."
Go on! Get in there!
"Or another."
<i>- Hey! Fly boy.</i>
- Yeah?
That was some little airshow.
You put on out there.
<i>Could you do that again?</i>
Who wants to know?
Of course! I can fly.
You saw me.
Good.
Put your ear to that
wall over there.
<i>Now that is the sound
of a blast cap.</i>
<i>I stuck to the other side…</i>
Set to go off in 30 seconds.
If I fly. Will you help me?
To find my mother.
I reckon, she is here
on the island.
It is not a negotiation. Kid.
Without me. You are
stuck in this cell.
Without me. You are
stuck in these mines.
Okay! Then we will
talk about it.
Just move away
from that wall.
Before, you get yourself
blown up. All right?
- So, what is it going to be?
- Kid!
Tick.
Tack.
Okay! We have a deal, just...
Fly boy?
Hurry! Slide down.
They will be coming for us.
If I am going to trust you.
I need to know your name.
It is Hook. The name
is James Hook.
- Happy?
- No!
Left foot in front
of the other…
Put the right one
in front of the other.
That is it. It has called walking.
Go on. Go on.
<i>Smee.</i>
Well! Go on, then. Carry on.
<i>- Smee. Down here!</i>
- Whoa!
<i>Six o'clock.</i>
I do not... Yes...
<i>Darn it, Smee, in the basket.</i>
Please do not call me Smee?
Smee. Can you get me?
To the surface.
There is no use.
Once you are up there.
You cannot get anywhere else.
Not today.
Good knowing you.
<i>You have been a true friend.</i>
Someday I will find a way
to repay you.
Now! Send us up.
What the heck?
You just said someday…
You will find a way to repay me.
Someday, not today.
Get out!
I think that is a very
minor technicality.
Someday could be today,
if you think about it.
<i>- And...
- Smee!</i>
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>That is where we are headed.</i>
The Skyport.
We can take one of
the cable cars up to the dock.
<i>Then you will fly
us to a ship.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>
Keep your head down. Kid.
Go! Go!
See? They anchor the galleons
far enough off the dock.
<i>So, they are impossible
to steal.</i>
So, you want me to fly from the
dock, over to one of the...
What? Speak now,
or forever hold your peace.
Have we meant to stop?
Whoa!
Heave! Heave!
Forget the Skyport.
You have to do it now.
<i>Are you waiting
for a formal invitation?</i>
- Go! Now!
- I am afraid of heights!
What? You can fly!
Yesterday was my first time.
<i>Well! You had better fly again.</i>
<i>Or we are all going to fall
for the last time.</i>
Might we bicker
about this later?
Smee! The sword!
Yeah! That is going to work. Kid.
Get up there.
And, wave it at them.
<i>Heave!</i>
That was close.
Do you know how
to work a ship?
How hard could it be?
- Smee! The rope!
- Yes! Yes!
- Clear!
- Boy!
<i>Whoa!</i>
This is a lot harder
than it looks!
Yeah! We are sailing now!
Well! Do you have?
Anything to say?
I worked hard setting
up that table.
What? Forget the table.
Pick them up later.
If that boy makes it
to the natives.
You can forget any chance
of us winning this war.
All will be lost.
<i>We will find them, sir.
They cannot have gone far.</i>
Well! Then where are they?
Get me that boy
before the savages do it!
Dead ahead!
<i>Smee! Get off my leg!</i>
<i>I think I am going
to be sick!</i>
The wall! The wall!
Somebody, please help me!
Turn!
Smee! Get the sails up!
We need a strong headwind
to make the jump!
What jump?
Home! We are getting
the heck off this island!
No!
You said we would
find my mother!
I am not leaving Neverland!
Well! Not now, anyway!
Get the sails up!
The sails!
This is going to be
a little rough!
Put the sails up!
How many times...?
I am not to be disturbed.
When I am at the Rejuvenation!
Yes?
I am sorry, Captain.
However, it is about the boy.
<i>The stolen ship went down
in the Never wood.</i>
So, the boy is lost.
Yes. Sir. He is a lost boy.
<i>But our best men are
searching for him now.</i>
Imbeciles surround me.
Must I do everything myself?
Sir. You cannot
really, believe…
That this squeak is the one.
He hardly seems capable.
His mother hardly
seemed capable either.
And, yet, here we are.
The deal was to help me
to find my mother.
You were going to break it.
That is very wrong.
No. You broke the deal first.
You lied to us.
No. I fibbed. I can fly.
Just not every day.
Whoa!
Our only way off this island…
And, now it is in pieces.
Satisfied?
Well! Yes. I am
quite content.
Because I do not want to
get off this island.
<i>All the years that I have
wasted planning to get out.</i>
<i>All gone.</i>
Hey! Quit messing around.
It is not safe in here.
<i>Every ship has one.</i>
A what?
<i>A map!</i>
<i>What does that say?</i>
"Tribal Territory."
Exactly.
The prophecy said:
"A boy would lead the tribe."
So, what? You do not care!
I do. Keep going.
Well! Blackbeard thinks
the prophecy is about me.
Which means my mom?
Is from here.
This means the natives
might know where she is.
<i>Are you insane?</i>
If those savages would just
kill you. I help you.
- Ever met one.
<i>- No!</i>
And, I do not plan to meet.
Well! They might be very nice.
I am not afraid of them.
There is a fine line between
bravery and suicide. Kid.
I am going off to find the Tribal
Territory. Goodbye!
He will not last an hour
out there.
His problem. Not ours.
Thing in this, if he
was the chosen one...
If that prophecy is real.
Trust me, he is not it.
But, if they thought, he was...
They believed he was...
I bet they would
handsomely reward…
<i>Anyone who brought him
to them.</i>
Well! They do not
have a ship.
<i>Yeah! But they could get one.</i>
Who has fought the pirates?
More than the natives.
If anyone could find a way.
It is they.
Just remember…
When we find those…
So, sweet natured locals.
True or not. You tell them
you are their savior.
Then, we will go our
separate ways. Got it?
Why would you want to leave?
A place like this.
Where will you go?
I do not know. Somewhere
I am a little higher up.
On the food chain,
for starters.
What was that?
Something a little higher up.
On the food chain.
That is pretty, Hook.
Do you see that?
<i>We got pirates trying
to shoot us down with cannons.</i>
<i>Nearly falling a thousand feet
to our deaths.</i>
Twice. Shipwrecked.
And, you see something
like that.
And, you think to yourself.
"Worth it."
Are you an orphan?
My mom left me. That count.
Well! Do you remember her?
I am not wasting tears missing
someone who never missed me.
Maybe she does.
<i>How can you know?</i>
Do you really believe?
Your mom is here.
Well! She left me
a note saying...
Well! If she left
you a note, sure.
Just because yours
never loved you.
<i>Stop.</i>
Does not mean my mom
never loved me.
Stop talking right now!
Did you hear that?
It was a deafening
nightmare shriek.
How can anyone
not have heard...?
That is a Never bird.
<i>And so is that.</i>
What are we going to do?
We need a plan.
We need a plan!
Run!
We will lose them
in the mist! Go!
Go!
<i>Run. Smee!</i>
Their faces are terrible…
However, their feathers
are quite lovely.
Shut up and run!
Go!
Smee!
Peter!
Hook? Is that you?
Peter.
Hook. They have Smee.
No.
Do not worry. Everything is…
Going to be all right!
I knew! We would
find the natives.
<i>We are saved.</i>
Please! I am ready
to go home now. Please.
Let me handle with this.
Good fair, woman.
We come in peace.
And, with treasure.
May I proudly present to you.
Pan!
Pan!
Pan!
Pan! Pan!
Pan!
Pan! Pan!
Pan!
Smee!
- Smee!
- What?
What about are they singing?
Search me!
Pan! Pan!
What is going on?
What is "Pan"?
The Pan is our tribe's
bravest warrior.
It is our tradition to grant
you the chance to win.
Your freedom before
we kill you and your friends.
Kill? What do
you mean: "Kill".
You are our sworn enemy.
You are pirates.
Pirates? We are not
pirates. Hold on!
The kid is the one.
You have been waiting.
Listen!
Your chance to live.
Your fiercest fighter
against ours. Our Pan.
<i>You win. You live.</i>
- You lose...
- I get the idea.
Bye for now.
Pan!
So, how do we know?
When we to start.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Smee!
- What?
We have to tell them
about my mother.
No one cares about
your darn mother!
Sorry! That was a bit harsh.
Okay.
Your Highness.
I was hoping to
get you alone.
Stop!
The little one.
He wears the Pan.
He is a boy that can fly.
I have seen it.
It is terrific.
We call this the Memory Tree.
It was a time of war.
<i>Blackbeard destroyed
everything in pursuit...</i>
<i>Of the Pixum.</i>
<i>But then, the chief
made a pact.</i>
<i>With the great fairy king.</i>
<i>Uniting our peoples
against the pirates.</i>
<i>One night, the king's son,
the fairy prince…</i>
<i>Found his way onto
Blackbeard's ship.</i>
<i>Her name was Mary.
The love of Blackbeard's life.</i>
<i>And his most prized
possession.</i>
<i>Night after night,
the prince visited Mary.</i>
<i>But when Blackbeard
discovered them.</i>
<i>He flew into a jealous rage.</i>
<i>So, in order to save her,
the prince took human form.</i>
<i>But though fairies can live
many thousands of years.</i>
<i>In human flesh,
they can live only one day.</i>
<i>The prince sacrificed his life
for the girl he loved.</i>
<i>And, the child of that love.</i>
Was you.
<i>Our people helped your mother
hide you in the other world.</i>
And, they made
you this totem.
So, that when you returned.
We would know it was you.
What happened to my mother?
She returned to the Never wood.
And, fought for us many years.
And?
<i>The pirates. We have
winning the war.</i>
<i>And, the fairies had to retreat
to a hidden kingdom.</i>
<i>They have remained there,
in hiding.</i>
<i>Unknown by Blackbeard.</i>
<i>Until a time when they can
reemerge and fight.</i>
And, my mother?
- She is with them.
- She is alive.
Are you sure?
I have to go to her!
- Please, take me now!
<i>- No.</i>
You must be patient.
However, she is waiting for me.
The fairy kingdom is the
greatest secret of this land.
Our duty is to protect it.
Before we take you there…
You must prove us
to be Mary's son.
<i>The one we have been waiting.</i>
When the third moon rises…
He must fly.
If he lives…
He is the one.
One second.
And, if he dies?
He is an imposter.
<i>His death will be justified.</i>
Three days!
I have the necklace.
Is not that enough?
You could have stolen it.
However, I did not. Tell her!
Kid has always
had that thing.
How long have you known him?
- Three days.
- All my life.
The flying thing
is a stupid detail.
Why cannot they
just see that?
If you do not believe, Peter,
Then neither wills them.
But, if you do, they will, too.
I promise.
Are you whom
they think you are.
- I do not know.
- Hey!
They think you are
their messiah.
That you are here
to liberate them.
Are they right?
I said: I do not know!
Rabbits.
I believe.
I can fly!
If only Nibs was here.
He would know how to help.
<i>I believe.</i>
Have you seen Smee?
The things they
expect me to do.
I cannot do them, Hook.
I have tried.
- Hey! Stop. Hey!
- I cannot do the things.
Therefore, I cannot
be the one!
Listen.
Hook. What the
bloody hell is I.
You can go feeling sorry for
yourself all you want. Kid.
However, knowing
where you are from.
That is half of knowing
who you are.
That is more than most of us.
Here will ever know.
However, you said that
your mother left you.
Yeah. I lied.
I do that sometimes.
It has called being
a grown-up!
<i>Least you know
where you do from.</i>
Born to a warrior,
to a prince.
- Does that mean you are the one?
- I do not know.
<i>I do not know
if there is a "One."</i>
<i>But I do know.</i>
That if you are not
the person.
And, you are just you.
Maybe that is enough.
<i>Where is the boy?</i>
Spill the beans.
Or, I will spill your blood.
I will never tell.
He is right over there.
<i>Nope! Nope! Wait! My mistake.</i>
Sure, it is that way. No!
No. Right the first time.
Definitely, maybe definitely,
this way.
The point is.
We are very close.
Ready the ships.
Bishop kills him.
No! Just wait!
Wait!
You might not want to
kill me just yet.
For I hold the crown jewels.
You know.
- Information ally.
<i>- Speak.</i>
Sorry, a bit nervous.
You are quite intimidating.
Speak!
Now! You know the so-called
extinct fairy kingdom.
Speak.
Sorry.
I was just looking for you.
Well! You found me.
Do not see things
like that in the mines.
Kind of beautiful.
So, do you like sunrises?
What is it you think?
You are doing.
Well! I think it has
called flirting.
However, if you have to ask it.
I might be doing it wrong.
You are not like the men
from my tribe.
Thank you.
No. They are honest.
- Strong. Brave.
- Brave.
That what you call it?
Letting my little buddy
take a leap to his death.
When he ceases to doubt himself.
He will fly.
How do we know?
There are any fairies…
Still left on this island…
Or, that they will come
help fight…
Just because they see him fly.
You have to trust us.
Why should we?
You certainly do not trust us.
There is a map to
the fairy kingdom.
We guard it with our lives.
Of course there is.
Why would not there be a secret
map to the secret kingdom?
This is not a game.
You have seen what Blackbeard
has done to Neverland already.
He will reduce the rest of it
to nothing but mine pits.
If we do not stop him.
Has anybody ever told you?
You have really
beautiful eyes.
<i>Fire on the foredeck.</i>
<i>Prepare to come around.</i>
Tiger Lily!
You missed.
We must find Peter!
Shoot her!
- Peter!
- Where is Hook?
All of this because of you.
No. Kwahu, wait!
You are welcome.
Now! Come on!
Keep moving!
<i>Well! Well! Well.</i>
The princess. I presume.
<i>Well! Actually,
I am just a miner.</i>
But, I appreciate
the compliment.
Bishop.
Go on.
<i>Line them up.</i>
<i>Down here.</i>
All these years digging
our hands raw.
For tiny lumps of Pixum.
And, now I learn
from Mr. Smee…
<i>You know where there is
a mountain of the stuff.</i>
Nice as pie.
Tell me where the boy is.
<i>And, how to find the fairy
kingdom, and you may live.</i>
Death is the greatest
adventure.
Bonn voyage.
All hail the new Chief.
<i>Princess Tiger Lily.</i>
All hail!
Tell him. He will kill you.
He is right. You know.
Nice birdie.
- There is a map.
- Traitor.
<i>Do not shoot her.</i>
She told me there is a map
to the fairy kingdom.
Traitor! How dare you
betray us, pirate?
I am trying to save your lives.
Sweetheart.
It will not happen again.
It will not, I guarantee it.
Captain.
Go! Kid.
Yeah!
Kill them all!
Whoa!
<i>Attack. Attack!</i>
No!
<i>Can I tell you something?
Peter.</i>
You will never find
your mother.
Yes. I will find her.
No. You really,
really, will not.
You will never find your mother.
Do you know why?
Because I killed her.
<i>She died at my hand.
By this very blade.</i>
As you will, too.
Close your eyes, Peter.
And, think a happy thought.
Bad form. Sir!
We have to run. Now!
No. We have to jump.
Peter is you hurt.
Well! I am fine, too.
Thanks for asking.
Do not speak to me.
Because of you, everything, my
people have fought to protect…
- Will destroy it.
<i>- Hey...</i>
Because of you,
the Chief is dead.
- Smee was the rat.
- He was your friend.
- How was I supposed to know?
- You should have known.
- I am sorry.
- You should have known.
I am sorry. If I did
something, wrong!
Where is Peter?
Peter.
<i>You lied.</i>
- You all lied.
<i>- I am sorry.</i>
So, it is true.
It is complicated.
Is my mother alive?
Or, is not?
Blackbeard spoke the truth.
And, you lied to me.
Had we told you she was dead?
You would have walked away
from your destiny.
Whoever it is you think I am…
Whatever it is, you
expect me to be…
I am not.
And, I cannot.
I could not...
I did not want
to watch you die.
You should have
closed your eyes.
<i>Blackbeard will not
stop searching for Peter.</i>
<i>There is only one place
on this island.</i>
<i>He would not dare look.</i>
Mermaid Lagoon?
Sounds pretty.
Therefore, pirates are
afraid of mermaids.
Because of what we will pass
through to get there.
Yeah?
Crocodiles.
Afraid?
No. Ma'am.
Find the map. Keep looking.
Does Smee please free?
<i>Pull the place apart!</i>
- So, may Smee be free?
- No. You are too useful.
But, Smee has promise...
Smee should cease to talk of
himself in the third person.
- Or, Smee will be a non-person.
- Yes.
I found it.
It is a map to
the fairy kingdom.
Ready the ships!
We must get there
before Peter.
Grab the torches.
They are afraid of the light.
Did we scare them off?
Come on! They can fly.
Keep waving the torches.
There!
Peter!
Peter!
I think I see him.
Where?
- Reach for my hand!
- Help! Help!
Peter.
What happened?
What are those?
I do not know, but I think.
You are going to like them.
You could say that again.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Do not go.
- I am going to check it out.
- Be careful.
Who is more careful
than I am?
I am sorry. I did not tell you.
What happened to your mother?
However, Blackbeard did not tell
you the whole truth either.
Let me show you.
The mermaids charged
these waters with memories.
You can see the past.
Deep breath.
There is no time.
Blackbeard's men
nearly have us.
Go to the fairy kingdom. Hide.
Keep our people safe.
You should never have
come back, Mary.
Yet, here you are…
Ready to die for them all,
rather than live with me.
No. Mary.
No! No!
No!
She was a warrior.
A great warrior. Her sacrifice
still inspires us.
Did you know her?
She trained me.
Would she have been
proud of me?
Yes.
Very.
However, what if I cannot do
what she did?
What if I fail to
fulfill the prophecy?
And, what if you fail
to try, Peter?
What are you then?
<i>Hey!</i>
You have to see this.
Now, the hulls a
little banged up.
And, see those teeth marks?
Boy. Those crocks can jump.
However, once I get her fixed up.
She is going to be in good shape.
For what?
To get us the hell
off this island.
You are going to
run like a coward.
Well! I never really thought
of it in those exact terms.
However, generally
speaking. Yes.
And, where will you go?
Home. It is you know.
Where I come from.
Home is not where you come from.
It is where you make it.
So, help me do that.
Anyone that survived Blackbeard's
attack is in the mine by now.
And, I have been in there.
I am not going back.
Not for anything or anyone.
Well! If you have no
reason to stay. Then go.
Go now. Leave us to die.
I do not want you to die.
I want you to come with me.
And, if I do not?
Then that is your decision.
Not mine.
<i>Well! Kid.</i>
Looks like the old gang
is back together.
Let us get this
ship in the air.
Let us get one
thing straight.
I am not the chosen one.
The prophecy was not about me.
If it was never real at all.
But, I am my mother's son.
If Blackbeard is going to destroy
everything my parents died for…
I will stand against him to the
last. Just like they did.
Now!
<i>Take me to the fairy kingdom.</i>
It is just as the
Chief described it.
These are words.
- What language is it?
- Must be fairy.
I can read.
<i>I can read it.</i>
What does it say?
"Only the prince who bears
the key shall pass."
<i>Just that.</i>
Then some boring stuff about
the great fallen dead.
It means we need a key.
Then this was all for nothing.
<i>No. I would not say that.</i>
"The prince who bears the key."
Do not you see, Peter?
- I am the...
<i>- You are bear the key.</i>
I am.
You have had it all along.
- She knew I would come for her.
<i>- Yes.</i>
Mom tries to protect the kingdom
by giving your son the key.
I kill Mom, but fail
to kill the son.
In turn, son fails to protect the
kingdom by giving me the key.
<i>Mom would be
very disappointed.</i>
Would not she?
Eternity beckons.
I will live forever.
Wakey! Wakey! Rise and shine!
That is where we are going.
The fairy hive.
Destroy that, and we
destroy them all.
<i>Yes!</i>
Yes! Come on!
Come on! Come.
Yes.
<i>Her name is Tinkerbell.</i>
I can hear her.
They have been waiting
for you, Peter.
You have to get
away from here!
He is going to destroy you all.
I know what I have meant to do,
but, I failed.
<i>I am sorry.</i>
<i>I am sorry!</i>
All right, boys,
let us burn them!
Burn them!
Bum them, burn them,
and burn them!
- Burn them all!
- No!
Please, I will do anything!
<i>- Please!</i>
- Do not beg.
Anything.
No. It is bad form to beg.
Where is your sense
of honor, boy?
Now! Kneel.
I said kneel!
I am the son of a
warrior and a prince.
I will never bow to you.
If you are going to kill me,
then get on with it.
As you wish.
You do not have to do this.
No.
However, I really want to do.
Did you miss me?
Why is it always him?
Jump!
You came back!
I thought you did not care!
As I said, sometimes I lie.
Come on!
I cannot let Blackbeard
get to the hive!
Hard to port!
Do you mind if I cut in?
We have to help her!
Take the wheel!
You are going to get this puppy,
as close to them as you can.
- Okay!
- I will jump across!
Hold on!
<i>Captain!</i>
No.
Peter. No!
No.
It is over, boy.
Come.
You! Grab that girl!
Pan!
I can fly!
Look at me, Hook.
I am flying!
All right, you do not have
to crow about it.
Whoa!
Crow all you want!
Just do not drop me!
Go on.
If we are going to beat him.
We are going to
do it together.
Do you hear me?
Good!
Now! Come on, then.
<i>Fire!</i>
Ready?
Go!
Got you!
Think a happy thought.
No!
Boy!
<i>♪ Hello. ♪</i>
Peter.
Peter.
Mom?
<i>You found me.</i>
I have your eyes.
You have my heart.
I have imagined this moment
My whole life, and now...
I love you, mom. So much!
I do not know how you can miss,
someone you have never met.
However, I have
missed you every day.
Every day?
Without you, I am lost again.
What do I do now?
You are not lost.
You are home.
On this island,
with these people.
Your people.
Your family.
You must never
give up on them.
As you never gave up on me.
However, mom…
I do not want
to lose you again.
<i>You will never lose me.</i>
<i>I will always be part
of this Neverland.</i>
And, a part of you.
I love you. My son.
My Peter.
My Peter Pan.
Peter.
Peter?
You thought I would
leave you here.
- No. I never.
- Feel like some fun.
Yes, please.
All right, people.
- Hold on tight.
<i>- Peter!</i>
You do not have a rope.
We have a lot to talk.
I thought you were leaving.
Change of heart.
Will you take the
wheel, please?
You do not want to go home.
I am home already.
<i>Is he a pirate, too?</i>
No.
Not yet, anyway.
Which way shall we go?
- Set a course!
- Set a course!
Hey! Who is in charge here?
Well! I am the captain.
And, I am the chosen one.
We will have plenty of time to
argue about that later. Fly boy.
Suit yourself, Captain Hook.
Set a course.
Second to the right,
and, straight on until morning.
<I>Neverland!</I>
<I>Neverland!</I>

Will not we?</i>
