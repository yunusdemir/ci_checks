THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>PRICÒ</i>
BY CESARE GIULIO VIOLA
Directed by
VITTORIO DE SICA
How many times have I told you:
Don't leave your bike in the courityard!
You just don't listen!
Good morning, Mrs. Resta.
Have I made myself clear?
Mrs. Nina.
Mommy doesn't want to go
to the movies.
I'm sorry I didn't let you know.
I want to take Pricò out
for some fresh air.
Very well. Have a nice day.
<i>I've been doing nothing</i>
<i>but singing serenades</i>
<i>beneath the window of Gabriella,</i>
<i>my fiancée.</i>
<i>Gabriella is in love with me.</i>
<i>- She's in love with me!</i>
With both of us, then.
Well, we can't both marry her.
There's no room for three here.
No, one of us is headed
for the other world.
Bon voyage.
- That remains to be seen.
En garde! Take one.
- Darn you!
- Grasp the hilt!
Look there.
Finally you're dead.
I'm going to call on my beloved.
- The money!
- Maria.
Quick, silly girl!
- My love, you're my hero.
- My little puppet.
- Shall we dance a tarantella?
- Yes, let's.
- Mommy.
- What is it, Pricò?
Is that a bicycle bell?
Yes.
Okay, go and have fun.
Just be careful, okay?
- Can I ride it?
- No.
Can I put my foot on it?
Okay, just your foot.
That's enough.
As you can see, I can no longer
come to your house.
How could I bear
to see you with him?
But I can't live like this either.
What about me?
How can I bear it, Roberito?
Nina, can you live without me?
I can't live without you either.
What are we waiting for?
We don't have to decide today.
Today, Nina.
Today.
I got a job in Genoa.
I'm leaving tonight.
I already bought tickets.
I got one for you too.
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- No, I'm going to the movies.
A little courage.
That's all it takes.
Good morning, Pricò.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much, Mr. Roberito.
I'm sorry. It's late.
We have to go home.
It was such a pleasure
running into you.
Say good-bye to Mr. Roberito.
- Mommy, are you crying?
- No, why would I be?
When there's a condominium
board meeting, you're just not yourself.
I can't miss it.
Mr. Ponti insists,
and they won't starit without me.
Besides, I have to protect
my own interests, don't I?
He makes a mess,
and I have to clean it up.
What are they waiting for?
Are you coming or not?
- His hands were dirity.
- You know they won't starit without me.
You're right. I'm sorry.
No need to apologize.
They'll just have to wait.
Did you have fun at the movies?
- I took him to the park.
- Weren't you going with Mrs. Resta?
It was such a lovely day.
I saw the puppet show.
- Did you enjoy it?
- Yes.
- Don't you like it?
- I'm not hungry.
He soils the tablecloth,
she doesn't like anything,
and the boy stuffs himself
with bread.
Agnese...
So the question of the garbage
has been resolved.
What else is on the agenda?
The elevator.
I can't go on depleting my salary
just to maintain the elevator.
I curse the day I bought
a condominium unit.
Goodness! Go and live
in a tenement, then.
Let's confront this problem
with the elevator once and for all.
Let's say no more trips going down
and be done with it.
Silence, please!
Let's vote on it.
One floor at a time.
A majority carries it. First floor?
I say it should go both up and down.
- Good evening, sir.
- I see we're discussing the elevator.
Sorry I'm late.
- It's nothing.
My friends, on the eighth floor
we have it worst of all.
But abolishing the use of the elevator
for trips going down
would save us a considerable amount,
which is imporitant these days.
For 25 lire a month,
you're all such misers.
- Who are you calling a miser?
- Misers.
Angel of God...
my guardian...
watch over me.
You who were sent to me...
Pricò. You who were sent to me...
from the heavens so blue...
And pink.
Aren't you going
to give me a kiss?
Can we go see
the puppet show again tomorrow?
Yes, darling. Tomorrow.
Put the cloth back on.
He'll drive us all crazy.
I'll put my tie on and go.
Is it Sunday, Daddy?
Why?
You're not going to the office.
No, it's not Sunday.
I'm going to the office.
It's already 9:30.
I'll make up some excuse for my boss.
Was Mommy here
with you last night?
Yes, Daddy.
- Did she tuck you in?
- Yes.
How could she have -
Excuse me, sir. I wanted to ask
Mrs. Nina for some matches.
Here you go.
I didn't want to bother you,
but your wife is always
so kind to me.
Isn't she home?
Think nothing of it, ma'am.
It's no bother.
Thank you.
- Who was it?
- Mrs. Resta.
Mommy isn't here.
She's gone.
When?
She's gone.
Perhaps she's visiting relatives.
She ran off.
No need for speculation.
She ran off.
In a few hours,
I'll know where she's gone.
You know something, then.
Everything.
You can't keep anything from me.
- What about him?
Who? The husband?
We were just talking,
but we didn't really say much.
- Who?
- He's really a nice boy.
It doesn't go down, sir.
You voted for it.
We were talking about your son.
Of course.
He's such a dear boy.
Agnese.
The boy can't stay here.
Take him to his aunt's.
<i>- This style has no ribs.</i>
- Really?
It allows total freedom of movement.
Try it, Mrs. Mancini.
I'm on my way.
- Make sure they pay you.
- What if they don't?
- How much is it?
- For you, 480.
Then don't give them the corset.
That's really excessive.
It's a special price for you.
This is a new line.
And it's so flattering on you.
You'll look so slim.
Go on, slowpoke.
I'm going, I'm going.
What a pain.
- Is Mrs. Berelli in?
- In the other room.
Excuse me, ma'am.
- What is it?
- The master sent me...
because -
What's happened?
He'd like you to keep the child.
He'll pick him up tonight.
- What about my sister?
- Mommy's gone.
- Ma'am, how much is it in satin?
- 630.
Highway robbery.
- When did she leave?
- Last night.
The master was at a condo board
meeting, and I was asleep.
Then she must have planned -
I never would have thought.
So it's really -
Ma'am, I'll keep my own after all.
It's more flattering.
As you wish, ma'am.
Good day.
Didn't she leave a note or anything?
Actually, I think -
Couldn't that blessed woman have -
Girls, keep him enteritained.
Come with me.
You'll have fun with us.
Sit down.
She's always been a romantic,
ever since she was a child.
And that poor man at home?
Couldn't she leave him a note?
Nothing!
That foolish girl.
Did she have to leave?
What about him?
- What time is it?
- 4:00.
I'm so sleepy.
- Why are you so sluggish today?
- I saw Gino last night.
No offense, but how can you
go out with a guy like him?
You wish you had a guy like him.
- What did you do?
- You know, he has -
He has a little aparitment.
He used the usual lines.
"It's just for half an hour.
No one will see you."
- I don't like him.
- Shut up.
Did you go with him?
- Of course.
- What time did you get home?
- This morning.
I can't help it.
I just don't like him.
- You don't like anyone.
- Well, I don't like him.
Good night.
I'm sorry, but this is a rush job.
Please, sit down.
It's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
Who would ever have thought -
You never expect
something like this to happen.
- She didn't come here?
- No, I told you on the phone.
But did you... know anything?
Me? How could I have known?
And what about you?
Are you sure you did everything
in your power to make her happy?
You trying to say
it's my fault?
Are you ready, dear?
Excuse me.
- Come in.
I'm running a little late.
Family business.
I'll be done in a minute.
Would you wait
in here a moment?
Of course.
<i>All right, I understand!</i>
<i>I get it!</i>
Come on.
We're going to Grandma's.
I know how you feel, poor man.
What's going on?
Nina ran off with Roberito.
That's all.
<i>Scoundrels!</i>
- Where's the child?
- I thought he'd be here by now.
And where have you been?
At the drugstore.
The drugstore? What for?
Your medicine.
You got it for me yesterday!
I just thought-
How often do I have to tell you
not to leave him alone for a second?
Go find him!
What a nuisance!
Sixteen lire.
What a nuisance this boy is.
- Naughty boy, you ran off.
- You're the one who ran off.
You'll hear from your grandmother now.
- Don't turn around in the street.
- Then why did you?
That's just dandy.
Look at the state you're in.
It's unbelievable,
the way you've been raised.
What was your mother doing all day,
with a maid and everything?
I don't have a maid,
even in my condition!
Well, enough said.
Your father brought you to me.
Things will be different here.
I want to live in peace.
You understand?
I want to live in peace.
Can I play in the haystack
again tomorrow?
Yes, but you have to go
to sleep right away, okay?
- Aren't you gonna give me a kiss?
- If you promise to go to sleep.
Paolina?
Imagine huriting a girl
who's been so devoted to him.
He could have killed her.
How do you feel?
- It hurits.
Come now, don't exaggerate.
It's nothing, Andrea.
A little scrape.
You were right to punish him.
You should have stayed in bed!
But I'm sure -
I'm sure that,
as far as the flowerpot goes,
he didn't do it on purpose.
No, he's a strange little boy.
At your age you weren't like him,
believe me.
Some kids take after their fathers,
and some after their mothers.
Mother dear,
even if it was a mistake...
I married her.
And I don't want -
with all due respect -
to hear her spoken of -
especially in front of -
Are you defending her?
Enough.
Would you prefer cheese or ham?
Neither, Daddy. I want water.
More water?
You didn't eat any breakfast either.
I'm not hungry, Daddy.
You're feverish.
Do you feel sick, son?
Are you cold?
I didn't mean to hurit Paolina.
How do you feel, Pricò?
Water, Daddy.
I'll give you some water.
I want to live in peace!
How do you feel, darling?
Why are you wearing your hat?
The people he was with -
It's a miracle he's still alive.
When they brought him home,
I thought he'd burn up from fever.
Why don't you take off your hat?
Mommy can't stay with us.
Daddy doesn't want me to.
What if I say I want you to?
Who do you think you are?
The master of the house?
If Mommy leaves, I'm going with her.
Mommy's going to the store now.
She'll get you some wonderful toy soldiers.
Don't leave.
Take your hat off.
...to the movies.
- Yes, dear.
What are you doing here?
Do you mean to drive me
from my own house?
Is that what you want?
Out with it.
Let me come home.
I thought you might come back.
Not for my sake, of course.
But I want you to know
that this wretch of a man
is only letting you stay...
for his sake.
Like my trumpet?
When can we leave?
Very good.
And now we'll play
an even better game,
the blacksmith game.
I don't want to play
blacksmith with you.
Everything's fine.
I'm so relieved.
- But what's wrong with you, ma'am?
- Why? I'm fine.
You seem changed.
Is something the matter?
What a fatty!
Fority-two pounds.
<i>Forty-four pounds.</i>
Thank heavens.
You had me frightened.
Ten days ago he weighed just 42.
I haven't been by because I didn't
know how your husband would react.
Perhaps it's better this way.
Yes, dear, go see the horses.
He still hasn't spoken a word to me.
What about you and your business?
Once summer begins,
just look how they dress.
Listen, I wasn't going to tell you,
but I just have to.
Roberito arrived yesterday.
He came to see me, of course.
He asked me to have you over.
He absolutely must see you.
He keeps saying,
"I just have to see her
for five minutes."
We've broken up so many times.
And each time, a minute
was enough to starit over again.
If he loves me, he should understand
and leave me alone.
I finally found the strength
to stop seeing him.
He should find that strength too.
The poor boy.
He's already up to 46.
See, I was right.
Back to normal weight in one month.
- What does he weigh?
- Fority-six.
Thank goodness.
We can be thankful.
We can consider ourselves lucky.
Agnese, get me the old wire cutters.
- I want to help you.
- All right, but don't touch anything.
I must talk to you about something.
We have to give the boy 25 lire.
Make it... 30.
Tomorrow's the 10th. He should buy
flowers for Mother's Day.
We've done it every year.
He should buy her flowers
this year too.
Thank goodness.
No bread!
Happy Mother's Day.
- Happy Mother's Day.
- Thank you.
You remembered.
Sit down.
- Andrea.
- I bought it.
Yes, Pricò insisted.
Thank you, but it's too nice.
<i>190,480.</i>
<i>125,600.</i>
412.
What color tie would you wear
with a blue suit, brown or red?
Andrea!
Brown would just kill the blue.
Pearl-gray or -
Either pearl-gray
or a very light blue.
Those are your only options.
Good day, sir.
The classic shades.
230,040.
35,400.
Where's your mommy?
Mommy's not home.
Tell her I have to speak to her.
Mommy's not here.
Why have you come?
I went to your sister's yesterday.
Didn't she tell you?
I want nothing more to do with this.
The child is here. Go away.
You shouldn't show up like this
at the homes of decent -
If you don't respect me,
at least show respect for others.
I can't have respect for anyone.
I have to speak to you.
Pricò, give me a minute.
The gentleman will be leaving soon.
Go and play in the other room.
<i>I found the strength to stop seeing you,</i>
<i>and you must find it too.</i>
<i>- But why?</i>
<i>- Why?</i>
<i>I haven't forgotten what we had,</i>
<i>but how can I forget</i>
<i>that I'm a mother?</i>
<i>How can I leave this house?</i>
Agnese.
<i>I'm not going back without you.</i>
<i>I don't care if-</i>
<i>You've gone mad, Roberto.</i>
<i>- I'm fighting for my life.</i>
<i>- And what about mine?</i>
<i>My life is here, with my child.</i>
<i>- The child was here two years ago.</i>
<i>You said yes to me then.</i>
<i>Didn't you love me?</i>
<i>Didn't you run away with me?</i>
<i>And weren't we happy?</i>
Then why ruin my life now?
Go away!
My baby!
Did you hurit yourself?
I ask your advice
because you're so experienced.
I'd like a nice beach
where my wife could meet new people.
Here in Rome she keeps running
into acquaintances.
If you really want to make
your wife happy, Alassio's the place.
My time there was sublime.
- That's a little far.
Hotels close to Rome
cost the same as in Rome.
The difference comes down
to 200 lire more for the trip.
What's 200 lire?
But we'd need
evening wear and all that.
My wife's not one
for a lot of commotion and fancy affairs.
But that's the whole point.
Ah, the social whirl -
the things people do in its name.
Perhaps a little elegance is called for.
- It is indeed. Are you working overitime?
- Yes.
Idiots.
You're all better now, Pricò,
aren't you?
I'm here, sweethearit.
Mommy's always here with you.
Were you frightened?
It's all over now.
Don't say anything to Daddy.
No, I won't say anything to him.
END OF PART ONE
PART TWO
Hold still just one more second.
Come on, no whining.
Don't be afraid.
Get that head underwater!
Did you hear what Daddy said?
She nearly died laughing, Dada.
She practically fell into my arms.
I refuse to believe it.
I know Lalla too well.
And yet after a mere two days,
she was totally smitten.
Peppi, you're such a bad boy.
Come on, Bobi.
You've made great progress, I see.
Good morning.
- Peppi, where's my son?
- Taking a shower.
Ulrico!
Leave me alone!
I'm not coming with you!
And his father always blames me.
Claudio, why don't you call Giuliano
for a little get-together?
No, that annoying Nani is here.
Him and his narcissistic ways.
Dada, we could have one of our games.
We could offer a prize.
Guess who just got here.
Who? Tell me.
Mimi!
What a bore!
Good day.
Let's go, Pricò.
- Don't try that with me.
- A peach.
You could have come quicker.
I only have two hands.
A peach as pretty as the lady.
There'll be an extra charge.
Fine. And some wine.
Their prices are sky-high
to starit with,
yet they charge extra
for one more piece of fruit?
Could I have some warm water
with a twist of lemon?
Sir, this morning after breakfast
there will be no resting.
We have work to do with our bocce!
- At your service, champion.
Don't count your chickens yet.
The score will be tallied at the end.
Then we'll see
who's the champion.
That's a laugh!
Professor Marangoni, in Bologna,
Parma or Reggio Emilia,
I'm always the top dog!
No dialect! Speak Italian!
- I'm number one.
- Good for you, Federico.
We'll see about that.
Good for you, Professor!
<i>Good for the professor</i>
<i>Always a professor</i>
<i>He'll beat the Bolognese</i>
<i>He'll beat the Bolognese,</i>
<i>no matter how long they play</i>
<i>Let's hear it for the professor</i>
They're all just jealous.
They're so annoying.
I'll see them on the bocce courit.
I don't think Parma, Bologna
or Modena ever saw such a shot.
Braggarit. I'll learn ya good.
- Speak Italian.
- I'll show you.
These balls are charmed.
Just a minute, Professor.
It's my turn.
- Have a nice walk.
- Thank you.
- May I ask a favor of you?
- Of me?
- I'd like the madam's address.
- What for?
Because...
there's something
very imporitant I have to tell her.
You can tell it to me.
I can't give out her address.
I have very strict orders
not to give it out.
To anyone.
All right. It doesn't matter.
You and Pricò could stay on
a few more days, don't you think?
No, we've spent so much already.
So what?
You've enjoyed yourself,
and that's all that matters.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
You can join me later.
It's the inseparable pair.
Please, don't get up.
Tomorrow I'm afraid
we will be separating.
But that's unacceptable.
A true betrayal.
You're abandoning us so soon?
Duty calls.
But my wife and son are staying.
Your wife is staying?
Will you allow us
to take her under our wing?
That's very nice of you.
I'd be honored.
Good day.
Dada, the people you befriend!
It's not for me.
One must think of one's friends
once in a while.
She's very attractive.
All aboard.
Hands inside, please.
All aboard.
I forgot to tip the doorman.
Give him about 30 lire.
And you make sure Agnese
put my fox fur in moth balls.
I'll take care of it.
And you, Pricò, be a little gentleman
with your mother.
Take her on long walks.
See that she rests after lunch.
Take her to the movies -
just as if I were here.
I'm leaving a little man behind,
not a child, right?
Good-bye, darling. Think of me.
Of course.
Will you write?
How long will you be in Savona?
Two weeks.
Excuse me, miss.
Pricò, these 10 lire are for you to spend.
Don't go back there.
Good-bye, Nina. See you soon.
My regards to everyone.
Mr. Maritini, Mrs. Vigo, everyone!
Professor Marangoni!
Pricò, be a good boy!
THURSDAY AT 9:00 P. M., WORLD-
FAMOUS PROFESSOR GABRIELLI
WILL PERFORM FEATS OF MAGIC,
TELEPATHY AND SLEIGHT OF HAND.
After my scientific experiments,
I'll perform some sleight of hand
for the delight of the little ones
and grown-ups alike.
Please verify that there is
absolutely nothing inside.
What a bore!
We'll give the second hat
to this gentleman
with such an intelligent expression.
He'll be able to tell
if any trick is involved.
Her husband had barely left
when she kicked up her heels.
See for yourselves.
Don't take my word for it.
- What a bore!
- A little old-fashioned fun can't hurit.
- Enjoying yourself, ma'am?
- Very much.
Please bring your top hats
back to the magician.
Go away, little boy.
Get out of here.
Good thing
I didn't bring my dog.
He'd have torn
the pigeons to pieces.
Really?
What did I tell you?
One night, I took him -
I took him
to a parity at Luciano's.
You can imagine
what mayhem ensued.
Dada?
- What?
Remember when I took
my dog to Luciano's?
I'll bring him one night.
I'm sure you'll love him.
He's such a baby.
I've spoiled him.
I let him get away with murder.
In love, too...
I'm very giving.
Nina, dance with Mimi.
Ulrico, you boys go off and play.
- Giuliana, organize a supper for later.
- Yes, dear.
I have a penthouse in Roma
that's so much fun.
Careful, Nina.
Mimi's a dangerous man.
Like a steamroller.
You're so silly, Dada.
Go on. You're wonderful!
I envy you.
You've found some peace.
- You don't know what you're saying.
- Perhaps it's best this way.
After last night,
I wrote my office and said
I'd take my old job back
if they'd have me.
I'll go back and work in Genoa.
- That's a good idea.
What do you care about me
and my life anyway,
what I do or don't do?
Just a few weeks
have erased your memory.
I know you haven't forgotten me.
It's not over between us, is it?
Roberito, don't toriture me like this.
You said you're leaving Monday.
There's three days left.
Let me see you these three days.
They'll fly by.
Then we'll leave it to God's will.
But for now, let me -
I love you, Nina.
I love you.
Why didn't you make the same flavor
ice cream as yesterday?
This is better. Hold on.
Here.
Why aren't you at the beach?
Are you sick?
No, Mommy didn't take me.
Want to come play with me?
I'm bored all by myself.
Go play in the garden with Francesco.
<i>Don't forget my words</i>
<i>I'm dying of love for you</i>
You're so beautiful
with that dark tan.
Whereas I'm red as a lobster.
You've only been here two days.
Your hair's all messed up.
It looks nice like this.
Two hundred lire.
Next.
Step up!
How can I step up?
It's impossible.
Where are you going?
Home to Daddy in Rome.
Whose child is this?
Where's the train for Rome?
Who's there?
What are you doing there?
Go away! Get out of here!
Get down from there!
Mother of God!
Did you hurit yourself?
Get out of here!
Did you hurit yourself?
Go away!
Look at this boy.
He gave us a workout.
Hey, little boy.
Where do you live?
Answer me.
Hotel Miramare.
It's him.
She left him alone for three days
to go off with her boyfriend.
The poor husband.
There he is now!
The little boy!
There he is,
with those policemen.
Good evening, Officer.
- Where have you been?
- Look at the state you're in.
- Which of you is his mother?
- Not me.
She's upstairs in her room.
- Are you his mother?
- Yes.
We found him over a mile from here.
You should keep an eye on him, ma'am.
You're really something, kid.
Thank you.
<i>Is that all right?</i>
You forgot one hook.
<i>- Which one?</i>
- The second one.
You're right. I didn't see it.
There. Your wife will be happy.
She always said she couldn't stand
those old curitains.
Yes, she wanted these new ones.
Be careful not to fall.
I'll be right back.
Daddy, we're home.
What's this? I didn't expect you
until tomorrow.
Madam told Giulio here that -
Good evening, sir.
Your wife had an errand to run.
She said she'd be right back.
- At 9:00 at night?
- That's what she said.
Then she left the kid with me
and went on in the taxi.
And the suitcases?
She gave me that one.
What about her big suitcase?
Madam only gave me that one.
Good night.
Daddy, I brought back a starfish.
It cost me a lira.
Ulrico sold it to me.
I've got lots of seashells too.
I've even got a red one,
but it's broken.
I'll go get dinner ready.
Let me know
when you want to eat.
Where did Mommy go?
I don't know.
Did you come
from the station together?
Yes.
Then what?
Then Mommy went to the store.
Listen, Pricò,
you love Daddy, don't you?
Yes, Daddy.
Remember the day you came with me
when I left on the train?
- Yes.
- Good boy.
Were you always together after that?
Just the two of you?
What is it, Pricò?
I was naughty,
and Mommy got sick
because I was very naughty.
Sick?
Yes, because I ran away.
You did?
I wanted to come home to you
on the train.
Come home to me?
What did Mommy do to you?
Nothing.
Did someone come to visit
after I left?
Who came?
No one, Daddy.
You're not telling the truth.
I know who came.
Mommy wrote me about it.
You must remember.
Don't lie to me.
You ran away because
someone came to see her.
Answer me.
So...
it's all clear now.
It's all crystal clear.
Let's have some dinner now.
Telegram.
For you.
The receipt.
Where are your pajamas?
Mommy put them on the bottom.
Where's my starfish?
Here. Now hurry and get into bed.
Turn out the light soon, okay?
Don't shut the door.
All right, but settle down
and go to bed.
How is Pricò?
He's fine, thank God.
Now what are we going
to do with him?
Don't worry about him.
He'll be fine here with me.
Excuse me, Agnese,
could you lend me some salt?
Sorry. I'm all out.
Tell me, is Mrs. Nina back yet?
Yes, she's back.
She is?
But she had to go see her sister,
Mrs. Berelli.
Good night.
Her sister? Good night.
How can the boy
possibly stay here?
The gossip mill has already starited,
from basement to rooftop.
Come with me.
Don't leave me alone.
I can't be alone.
<i>As you can see, sir,</i>
<i>after the last fitting,</i>
I left it a little loose all over
so he could grow into it.
This way it will still fit next year.
My illustrious boarder,
your uniform is now complete.
Very handsome.
I don't like this.
What do you mean?
You look so dashing.
When I was little,
I had a hat just like this one.
I was so happy.
Why don't you want to wear it?
See how good it looks on you?
<i>Good boy.</i>
<i>It's a pleasure</i>
<i>to meet you, Andriani.</i>
You're going to like it here.
Summer vacation's not yet over,
but in a few days you'll meet
your fellow boarders.
Scores of them,
all just like you.
I'd like to ask you
to keep an almost paternal eye
on my son.
He's a little too sensitive,
and he needs a lot of affection.
Don't worry.
We'll be like a family to him.
That's exactly what he needs.
Here are his papers.
- Very good.
Be a good boy, okay?
Be happy.
When did this tragedy happen?
Have some water.
Poor man.
What a horrible end.
The poor man!
It's a very painful thing.
You'll have to get
your emotions in check, ma'am.
Here comes Father Michele.
The boy's grown
very attached to him.
I'm sure he's found the right words
to prepare him for the sad news.
What a terrible blow
for a child.
These things can affect you
for an entire lifetime.
Go on.
Go to your mother.
Go to Mommy.
