Time to get up, man.
All right, Dad.
Come on.
Should be here soon.
<i>♪ Go marching in ♪</i>
<i>♪ Oh, when the saints
Go marching... ♪</i>
I think I should make a list.
Uh, what do mean?
For your birthday gifts?
Yeah.
Well, you know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?
Yeah, I know.
Just to look at and study,
so I can choose better.
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?
I think so.
All right.
That's good.
How you doing in here, man?
Okay.
Can we go to the park today?
After?
Um. No, I gotta
go to Oakland.
Well, uh...
maybe. We'll see.
Give me a kiss.
I'll talk to you later.
Excuse me.
Oh. Excuse me, uh...
when is, uh, somebody
gonna clean this off?
And... And...
And the Y?
The Y. We talked
about this.
It's an I in "happiness."
There's no Y in "happiness."
It's an I.
<i>I'm Chris Gardner.</i>
<i>I met my father
for the first time</i>
<i>when I was 28 years old.</i>
<i>And I made up my mind
as a young kid</i>
<i>that when I had children,</i>
<i>my children were gonna know
who their father was.</i>
<i>This is part of my life story.</i>
<i>This part is called...</i>
<i>"Riding the Bus."</i>
What's that?
It's a time machine, isn't it?
Seems like a time machine.
That seems like a time machine.
It's a time machine.
Take me with you.
<i>This machine...</i>
<i>This machine on my lap...</i>
This guy, he has a time machine.
He... He... He travels.
He travels in the past
with this machine and...
<i>it is not a time machine.</i>
<i>It's a portable
bone-density scanner.</i>
<i>A medical device
I sell for a living.</i>
Thank you for the opportunity
to... To discuss it with you.
I appreciate it.
We just don't need it, Chris.
It's unnecessary.
And expensive.
Well, maybe next...
Thank you.
<i>It gave a slightly denser
picture than an x-ray...</i>
<i>for twice the money.</i>
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.
What happened?
Uh... No, nothing.
Look, I can't get
Christopher today.
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I need...
I'm back on at 7.
I know. I have got
to go to Oakland.
So I gotta
get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him,
get him in bed, and be back here by 7?
Yes.
And we got
the tax bill notice today.
What are you gonna do
about that?
Look. This is what
we gotta do.
<i>You see that car?</i>
<i>The one with the pretty
yellow shoe on it?</i>
<i>That's mine.</i>
<i>There's no parking
near hospitals.</i>
<i>That's what happens
when you're always in a rush.</i>
Thanks anyway.
Uh, very much.
Uh... Uh, maybe next quarter.
It's possible.
<i>I needed to sell at least
two scanners a month</i>
<i>for rent and daycare.</i>
<i>I'd have to sell one more</i>
<i>to pay off all of those tickets
under my windshield wiper.</i>
<i>The problem is...</i>
<i>I haven't sold any for a while.</i>
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?
Since birth?
What's that?
What?
What is this?
It's a gift for Christopher.
From who?
Cynthia from work.
It's for adults.
Chris can't use it.
She didn't know.
What are you supposed to
do with it?
Make every side the same color.
Did you pay the taxes?
No, I'm gonna have to,
uh, file an extension.
You already filed an extension.
Yeah, well, I gotta
file another one.
That's...
It's $650.
I'll have it in the next month.
That means interest, right?
And a penalty?
Yeah, a little bit.
Look, why don't you
let me do this?
All right, just relax.
Okay?
Now, come here.
Calm down.
I have to go back to work.
Let's get ready for bed.
Hey, uh, put your plate
in the sink.
<i>A few days ago I was presented
with a report I'd asked for.</i>
<i>A comprehensive audit,
if you will,</i>
<i>of our economic condition.</i>
<i>You won't like it.
I didn't like it.</i>
<i>But we have to face the truth</i>
<i>and then go to work
to turn things around.</i>
<i>And make no mistake about it...</i>
<i>we can turn them around.</i>
<i>The federal budget
is out of control.</i>
<i>And we face runaway deficits
of almost $80 billion</i>
<i>for this budget year</i>
<i>that ends September 30th.</i>
<i>That deficit is larger</i>
<i>than the entire
federal budget in 1957.</i>
<i>And so is the almost
$80 billion</i>
<i>we will pay in interest
this year on the national debt.</i>
<i>Twenty years ago, in 1960,</i>
<i>our federal government payroll</i>
<i>was less than $13 billion.</i>
<i>Today it is 75 billion.</i>
<i>During these 20 years,
our population</i>
<i>has only increased
by 23.3 percent...</i>
Woo! Man.
I got two questions for you:
What do you do?
And how do you do it?
I'm a stockbroker.
Stockbroker.
Oh, goodness.
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?
You don't have to.
Had to be good with numbers
and good with people.
That's it.
Hey, you take care.
Hey. I'm gonna let you hang on
to my car for the weekend.
But I need it back for Monday.
Feed the meter.
<i>I still remember that moment.</i>
<i>They all looked so...</i>
<i>damn happy to me.</i>
<i>Why couldn't I look like that?</i>
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.
I'm, uh, gonna stop by
a brokerage firm after work.
For what?
I wanna see about a job there.
Yeah? What job?
Uh, you know, when I...
When I was a kid,
I could go through a...
A math book in a week.
So I'm gonna go see about, uh,
a job they got down there.
Oh.
What job?
Stockbroker.
Stockbroker?
Yeah.
Not an astronaut?
Don't talk to me
like that, Linda.
I'm gonna go down
to see about this,
and I'm gonna do it during the day.
Mm-hm.
You should probably
do your sales calls.
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.
I got three of 'em
before the damn office
is even open.
Do you remember that
rent is due next week?
Probably not.
We're already
two months behind.
Next... Next week
we'll owe three months.
I've been pulling double shifts
for... For four months now,
Chris.
Just... Just sell
what's in your contract.
Get us out of that business.
Linda. That is what
I am trying to do.
This is what I'm trying
to do for my family.
For you and for Christopher.
What's the matter with you?
Linda.
Linda.

Tim Brophy, Resources.
How are you?
Come with me.
Yes, sir.
Let me see if I can
find you an application
for our internship.
I'm afraid that's all
we can do for you.
See, this is
a satellite office.
Jay Twistle in the main office,
he oversees Witter Resources.
I mean, I'm... You know,
I'm just this office.
As you can see, we got a hell
of a lot of applications here...
Normally I have a resume sheet,
but I can't seem
to find it anywhere.
W-we, uh... Uh...
Um... Thank you very much.
I need to go. Um...
I'll... I'll br...
I'll bring this back.
Thank you.
Okay.
<i>Trusting a hippie

<i>Why did I do that?</i>
Excuse me. Excuse me.
<i>Like I said,

Hey! Hey!
Hey! Don't move!
Don't move! Stay...!
Stop! Stop!
Don't move! Stop this...!
Stop the train!
Stop! Stop!
<i>The program took just 20 people

<i>Bye, Mom.</i>
Bye, baby.
Come back without that, please.
Oh. Yeah,
I'm going to.
So go ahead, say goodbye to it,
'cause I'm coming back
without it.
Goodbye and good riddance.
You ain't had to add
the "good riddance" part.
Bye, Mom.
Bye.
It's written as P-P-Y,
but it's supposed to be
an I in "happiness."
Is it an adjective?
Uh, no. Actually,
it's a noun.
But it's not spelled right.
Is "fuck" spelled right?
Yeah, that's spelled right.
But that's not part
of the motto,
so you're not supposed
to learn that.
That's an adult word
to show anger
and, um... other things.
But just don't...
Don't use that one, okay?
Okay.
What's that say on
the back of your bag?
My nickname.
We pick nicknames.
Oh, yeah?
What's it say?
"Hot Rod."
Did you have a nickname?
Yep.
What?
"Ten-Gallon Head."
Heh-heh.
What's that?
I grew up in Louisiana,
near Texas.
So everybody wears
cowboy hats. And a...
A ten-gallon's
a big hat.
I was smart back then,
so they called me
Ten-Gallon Head.
Hoss wears that hat.
Hoss?
Hoss Cartwright on <i>Bonanza.</i>
How do you know <i>Bonanza?</i>
We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.
You watch <i>Bonanza</i> at daycare?
Yeah.
When? When do...?
When do you watch it?
After snack?
After your nap?
After <i>Love Boat.</i>
I made my list for my birthday.
Yeah, what'd you...?
What did you put on there?
A basketball...
or an ant farm.
He says he's been watching TV.
Oh, little TV for history.
<i>Love Boat?</i>
For history. Navy.
That's... That's
not the Navy.
I mean, he... He could
watch television at home.
We're paying you $150 a month.
I-if he's gonna be
sitting around
watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.
You late pay anyway.
You complain.
I complain.
Can you at least put the dog
upstairs in you room
or something?
Bye.
<i>I was waiting for...</i>
<i>Witter Resource head,
Jay Twistle,</i>
<i>whose name sounded
so delightful,</i>
<i>like he'd give me a job</i>
<i>and a hug.</i>
<i>I just had to show him...</i>
<i>I was good with numbers
and good with people.</i>
Morning, Mr. Twistle.
Good morning.
Mr. Twistle. Chris Gardner.
Hi. Hi.
I wanted to
drop this off personally
and make your acquaintance.
I thought I'd catch you
on the way in.
I'd really love the opportunity
to sit and discuss
what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.
We'll start with this, Chris,
and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.
Yes, sir. You have a great day.
You too.
<i>Hey. Uh, yeah, how you doing?</i>
This is Chris Gardner
calling for Dr. Delsey.
Uh, yeah, look, I'm running
a little late for a sales call.
I was... I was wondering if...
Yeah, Osteo National.
Right. Uh, we can still...?
Half an hour?
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
<i>This part of my life...</i>
Wait!
<i>This part here...</i>
<i>it's called "Running."</i>
Hey! Hey!
Wait!
Hey! Wait!
<i>That was</i> my <i>stolen machine.</i>
<i>Unless she was with
a guy who sold them too.</i>
<i>Which was unlikely...</i>
<i>because I was the only one
selling them in the Bay Area.</i>
<i>I spent our entire life
savings on these things.</i>
<i>It was such
a revolutionary machine.</i>
Ooh.
Can you feel it, baby?
Oh, yeah. You got me
doing all the work.
<i>What I didn't know
is that doctors and hospitals</i>
<i>would consider them
unnecessary luxuries.</i>
<i>I even asked the landlord
to take a picture.</i>
<i>So if I lost one, it was like</i>
<i>losing a month's groceries.</i>
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!
Hey! Get back here!
Hey, man, uh...
Uh, I... Uh...
Who's he?
He's that guy.
<i>Did you forget?</i>
Forget what?
You're not supposed to
have any of those.
Yeah, I know.
You have two now.
Hey.
Hey, Mom.
<i>One...</i>
two...
three!
Whoo!
That's a basketball!
Hey, hey.
What do you mean?
You don't know that
that's a basketball.
This could be an ant farm.
This... This could be a...
A microscope or anything.
No, it's not.
There, there.
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.
That paper's a little heavy, huh?
Yeah, but I got it.
Yeah, you should've
seen me out there today. Uh...
Somebody, uh, stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down...
Whatever.
What?
Whatever, Chris.
What the hell
you got attitude about?
"Whatever" what?
Every day's
got some damn story.
Hey, hey, Roy.
Roy!
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?
There's dust and shit all over.
I'm trying to keep
a clean house.
Hey, wait a second.
Wait a second.
Listen.
Look, Linda. Relax.
We're gonna come out of this.
Everything is gonna
be fine, all right?
You said that before, when
I got pregnant. "It'll be fine."
So you don't trust me now?
Whatever.
I don't care.
Taxi!
Mr. Twistle.
Yeah, hi.
Hi. Chris Gardner.
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?
I submitted an application
for the intern program
about a month ago,
and I would just love
to sit with you briefly...
Listen, I'm going to
Noe Valley, Chris.
Uh, take care of yourself.
Mr. Twistle.
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.
Uh... how about
we share a ride?
All right, get in.
All right.
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor
who loved to play golf, hour...
Hours every day.
And... I would actually...
perform medical procedures
when he'd leave me
in the office.
So... I'm... I'm used to
being in a position
where... Where I have to
make decisions and...
Mr. Twistle. Listen, this is...
This is a very important...
I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh.
Th... This thing's impossible.
I can do it.
No, you can't. No one can.
That's bullshit.
No. I'm pretty sure I can do it.
Mm. No, you can't.
Let me see it.
Give it here.
Oh, yeah. Oh.
Wow, you... You, uh,
really messed it up.
Heh. Sorry.
Uh... it... It looks like it...
It, uh, works around a swivel,
so the center pieces
never move.
So if it's yellow
in the center,
that's the yellow side.
Right.
If it's red in the center,
that's the... red side.
Okay.
All right. So...
You... You can slow down.
Uh, listen, we can
drive around all day.
I don't believe
you can do this.
Uh, yeah, I can.
No. No, you can't.
Yes, I can.
No, you can't.
I'm telling you,
no one can. It's tough.
See? That's all
I ever do.
Uh, uh, uh...
Y-you almost have
this side.
Holy cow.
Oh. Oh, you almost
had that one.
I'm gonna get it.
Look at that.
You're almost there.
17.10.
Oh, this is me.
Good job.
Goodbye.
Yeah. I'll see...
See you soon.
Uh, where are you going, sir?
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?
Uh... Um...
Uh, two...
A couple blocks.
Just, you know, flip around.
Okay.
Hey! Stop it! Hey!
Where are you going?!
Come here!
No! No!
No. No, no, no, no!
Hey! You asshole. Give me
my money! Give me my money.
Please stop.
Please, please. Please!
Son of a bitch.
Please! He should've paid you!
He should've paid you!
Come here!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Come here. I'll kick your ass!
I'm sorry!
Idiot.
I'll get you!
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
Hey!
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
Stop him!
Stop him!
<i>The doors are closing.</i>
<i>Please stand clear
of the doors.</i>
No! No! No!
No!
<i>Hello?</i>
Hey. Yeah.
Sorry... Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.
<i>Chris. I missed my shift.</i>
Yeah, I... I know.
I'm sorry about that.
Look, um... I'm
on my way right now.
Are you all right
with Christopher?
<i>I'm leaving.
Chris, I'm leaving.</i>
What?
<i>Did you hear what I said?</i>
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...
and we're gonna leave now.
<i>I'm gonna put the phone down...</i>
Linda. Wait a minute.
Hold it... Hold...
<i>We are leaving.</i>
<i>It was right then
that I started thinking</i>
<i>about Thomas Jefferson...</i>
Wait, wait!
<i>...and the Declaration
of Independence...</i>
<i>...and the part about
our right to life,</i>
<i>liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.</i>
<i>And I remember thinking:</i>
<i>How did he know...</i>
<i>to put the "pursuit"
part in there?</i>
<i>That maybe happiness
is something</i>
<i>that we can only pursue.</i>
<i>And maybe we can actually
never have it...</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>
<i>How did he know that?</i>
Linda. Linda.
Hello?
<i>Chris.</i>
Who is this?
<i>Jay Twistle.</i>
Uh... Hey.
<i>Dean Witter.</i>
Yeah, of course. Uh...
Uh... how are you?
<i>I'm fine. Listen, do you still
wanna come in and talk?</i>
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
<i>I'll tell you what.
Come on by day after tomorrow,</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>
<i>We're interviewing
for the internships.</i>
<i>You got a pen and paper?</i>
Uh. Yes. Uh, yes, I do.
Um... Uh. Hold on one second.
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Chris?</i>
Uh... Uh, go ahead. I have one.
<i>Write this number down
so you can call</i>
<i>my secretary, Janice, and she
can give you all the specifics.</i>
Yep.
<i>Okay, 415.</i>

<i>Yeah, extension 4796.</i>

<i>Okay, buddy.

Thank you very much.
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>
864-0256.
4796. Janice.
Chris.
Hey.
Did you, uh...? Have you seen,
uh, Linda and Christopher?
No. You catch
the game last night?
No, no.
You didn't see that, 118-1... One...
Excuse me, did, uh, Linda
and Christopher come in here?
No, I haven't see them.
119-120. Double overtime.
Moons hits a three-pointer,
17 seconds left.
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.
What's your problem
with numbers?
8642.
And you owe me money.
Yeah.
You owe me $14.
I'm gonna get that to you.
I need my money.
I need my money.
Fourteen's a number.
Hey. Don't you ever take my son
away from me again.
Do you hear me?
Leave me alone!
Don't take my son away
from me again.
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.
Do you hear me?
Do you wanna leave?
Yeah.
You wanna leave?
Yes, I want to leave!
Get the hell out
of here, then, Linda.
Get the hell out of here.
Christopher's staying with me.
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?
You are so weak...
No. I am not happy anymore.
I'm just not happy!
Then go get happy, Linda!
Just go get happy.
But Christopher's
living with me!
Stop!
Did you hear what I said?!
Christopher's living with me!
Hey. Come... Come on.
Let's go.
How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
Hi.
Where's Mom?
Look, just get...
Get your stuff.
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.
Uh... Yeah, I know.
Um... I talked to
Mom earlier.
Everything is fine, okay?
Where do I sleep tonight?
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?
Yeah.
All right. Because I'm happy.
And if you're happy
and I'm happy,
then that's
a good thing, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. All right.
You're s... You're
sleeping with me.
You're staying at home,
uh, where you...
Where you belong, all right?
Uh...
Come on.
Christopher.
Hey. Listen, I need the rent.
Yeah.
I can't wait anymore.
Yeah, uh... I'm good
for that, Charlie.
I'm gonna get it.
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission Inn motel?
It's half what you pay here.
Listen, Chris. I need you
out of here in the morning.
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?
I got painters coming in.
All right. All right, look.
I need more time.
No.
All right...
I'll paint it myself.
All right, but I...
I just... I gotta have
some more time...
I got my son up in here.
All right.
One week.
And you paint it.

Payable to

Does it have to be the...
The full amount?
Well, you gotta pay
each parking ticket.
Otherwise, you're staying.
This is all I got.
You verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.
What?
Yeah, you gotta stay
until this thing clears.
No.
No, I... I can't... I can't
spend the night here.
I... I have to

You verify at
9:30 tomorrow.
Sir... I have a job interview
at Dean Witter
at 10:15
tomorrow morning.
I cannot stay...
9:30 tomorrow morning.
What am I supposed to do
with my son?
Is there anyone else who can...?
I take care of him.
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.
All right. Uh, can I make...
Have my phone call, please?
Hello.
<i>Hey.</i>
What do you want?
Um...
you gotta get
Christopher, uh...
from daycare.
I can't... Um...
Just keep him
for the night, and I'm gonna...
I... And, uh...
Just one night.
<i>What happened?</i>
I'll pick him up
from, uh, daycare... tomorrow.
I'm gonna go right...
You can just...
You can drop him off,
and I'll pick him up.
No.
<i>Come on, Linda.</i>
<i>Why you...?
Why you doing that?</i>
No. I wanna take him
to the park.
To Golden Gate...
after daycare tomorrow.
How is he?
He's fine.
All right, just... All right,
take him to the park... and...
And... bring him back,
all right?
All right, just...
bring... Bring me my son back.
<i>Okay?</i>
<i>Linda?</i>
I'll bring him back around 6.
All right. All right.
Uh... thank you.
Um...
All right.
Bye.
I'm okay?
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Yes, I did.
Mr. Gardner.
This way.
It'll be right this way.
What is the word on that one?
Chris Gardner.
Chris Gardner.
How are you?
Good morning.
Chris Gardner.
Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.
Chris Gardner.
Pleasure.
I've been sitting there
for the last half hour
trying to come up with a story
that would explain
my being here dressed...
like this.
And... And I wanted
to come up with a story
that would
demonstrate qualities
that I'm sure
you all admire here,
like... Like earnestness
or diligence.
And team-playing.
Something.
And I couldn't think...
of anything.
So the truth is...
I was arrested for failure
to pay parking tickets.
Parking tickets?
What?
And I ran all the way here
from the... The Polk Station,
the police station.
What were you doing
before you were arrested?
I was, uh...
painting my apartment.
Is it dry now?
Uh. I hope so.
Jay says you're
pretty determined.
Oh, he's been waiting outside
the front of the building
with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.
He said you're smart.
Well, I like to think so.
And you want to
learn this business?
Yes, sir, I wanna
learn this business.
Have you already started
learning on your own?
Absolutely.
Jay?
Yes, sir.
How many times
have you seen Chris?
Yeah, I don't know.
One too many, apparently.
Was he ever dressed like this?
No. No. Jacket and tie.
First in your class in school?
High school?
Yes, sir.
How many in the class?
Uh, 12.
It was a small town.
I'll say.
But I was also first
in my radar class in...
In the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.
Can I say something?
Uh... Um... I'm
the type of person...
if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer,
I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.
But I bet you what.
I know how to find the answer.
And I <i>will</i> find the answer.
Is that fair enough?
Chris.
What would you say
if a guy walked in
for an interview
without a shirt on...
and I hired him?
What would you say?
He must've had on
some really nice pants.
Chris...
I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man,
but you really pulled it off.
Thank you very much,
Mr. Twistle.
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.
All right, so I'll
let you know, Jay.
You'll... "You'll let me know,
Jay"? What do you mean?
Yeah. I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime...
What are you talking...?
You hounded me for this.
You stood here...
Listen. There's no salary.
No.
I was not aware of that.
My circumstances
have changed some,
and I need to be certain
that I'll be...
All right. Okay.
Tonight.
I swear, I will fill
your spot. I promise.
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?
Yes. An ass...
A-hole.
Yeah, an ass A-hole,
all the way.
You are a piece of work.

Yeah.

Yeah.
What?
Basketball.
You wanna go play

Okay.
All right. Then we're gonna

How about that?
Wanna do that?
No.
Hey, Dad, I'm going pro.
Oh.
I'm going pro.
Oh-ho!
Okay.
Yeah. I don't know,

Uh... you'll probably be
about as good as I was.
That's kind of the way
it works, you know.
And I... I was
below average.
You know, so...
Whoa.
So you'll probably

somewhere around there,
you know, so...
I really...

a lot of things,
just not this.

Okay.

Hey.
Don't ever let
somebody tell you...
you <i>can't</i> do something.
Not even me.
All right?

you gotta protect it.

they wanna tell you
you can't do it.
If you want something,
go get it.
Period.
Let's go.
Dad. Why did we move
to a motel?
I told you. Because I'm...
I'm getting a better job.
You gotta trust me, all right?
I trust you.

One day, a man was
drowning in the water.
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"
He said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"
And he said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.
And he said, "God,
why didn't you save me?"
And God said, "I sent you
two big boats, you dummy."
Do you like it?
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.
Oh. Thank you very much, sir.
Yes, sir.
You got the bill of sale here.
Yes.

He wasn't chosen.
It's not a simple pass/fail.

and then back in there

Oh, man, I remember mine.
And ours were only an hour,

Look, I'll still be putting
money into the office, then...
all right?
I really have to go, Chris.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.
I'll see you soon.
Why are our things here?
Dad.
Let's go. Come on.
Where?
Come on.
Just out of here.
Why?
We can't stay here tonight.
Yes, we can. Open the door!
Hey. Did you hear
what I said?
Let's go.
Open the door!
Hey. Did you hear
what I said? Stop it.
Stop it.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
<i>Wayne!</i>
Wayne!
Wayne!
Get up. Stand up.
Come on.
Where are we going?
Dad! Where are
we going?
I don't know.
It's not a time machine.
Dad.
It's not a time machine.
The guy said
it was a time machine.
It's not a time machine.
He was wrong.
What guy?
The guy.
He was at the park.
He said it was a time machine.
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
It is.
No, it's not.
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.
You wanna push it?
Okay.
Come on.
Come on, man.
Right here.
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?
I don't know.
Someplace from before.
You gotta close your eyes.
You close your eyes.
I wanna see.
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
It takes a few seconds.
Oh, my goodness.
W... Open, open,
open!
Whoa.
What is it?
Dinosaurs.
Where?
You don't see
all these dinosaurs?
Look around.
Look at all these dinosaurs.
Wow.
Do you see 'em?
Yeah.
Wait. Come on,
come on, come on.
Wait... Watch out.
What is it?
Don't step in the fire.
We're cavemen.
We need this fire,
'cause there's no electricity,
and it's cold out here, okay?
Watch out! Watch out!
Whoa! Oh, my good... A <i>T. rex.</i>
That's... Get your stuff.
Get your stuff.
Get... Get it...
Get up here.
We gotta find someplace safe.
Like what?
Um... we need a cave.
A cave?
We gotta find
a cave. Come on.
Okay.
Come on, come on.
Wait... Watch your
back! Look out.
Here it is. Here's
a cave. Come on.
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.
Whoa.
Go ahead.
Get in.
Hurry, hurry. Hurry.
Are we safe?
Yeah, I think so.
Hey.
How you doing? Jay?
I'm doing good.
How you, uh, getting along?
Good. I'm good.
You doing good?
How you doing?
I'm doing great.
Where you going?
Oh. Um...
I, uh... Sacramento.
'Cause, um...
I'm trying to move
a couple guys that... From...
They're at... At PacBell, and I'm
trying to bring them over...
Get them over to us.
So they got me
going out there golfing.
Awesome.
Hey, let 'em win a round.
Deborah. Someone's
asking for you.
Where?
He's outside.
Please come with me.
Hi.
How you doing?
Um...
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Um...
We need a room.
Um...
Just until I can...
fix this and sell it.
There's just some glasswork.
Let me stop you right there.
I wish I could help you...
This is my son, Christopher.
He's 5 years old.
Hi, baby.
We need someplace to stay.
Okay. And I would
love to help you,
but we don't take men here.
It's only women and children.
Now, he can stay here,
but you have to find
someplace else to go.
We gotta stay together.
We got... We... We're...
Okay. Okay, listen.
You gotta have someplace...
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.
So you hurry up,
'cause there's a line.
Where is it?
Where? Come on.
E-E-Ellis
and Jones.
Hey! Hey, everybody.
We have four spots left,
and that's all.
Man.
Hey. Come on, man.
Come on.
Come on, what?
Hey, that's my spot.
Back up.
Come on, don't do this to me. Don't...
Back up!
Dad! Dad!
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!
Stop! Stop!
Come here! Come here!
Get out of the line,
both of you. Both of you.
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be here on time.
I got here on time.
I was in line.
I came from work, I got my son.
I was here on time.
We were here on time!
He sliced in front
of him in line.
Who did?
He did.
He did.
Come on.
Come on, Rodney.
Come on. Let's go.
Get out of line.
That's it.
No more.
What's your favorite color?
Green.
Green?
Mm-hm.
What do you like that's green?
Trees.
Trees.
What else?
Holly.
Holly. What's holly?
The Christmas stuff.
Ah. Christmas
stuff.
What's that?
I guess they want us
to go to sleep.
There you go.
We gotta...
make sure Captain America's
warm in there.
Can he breathe?
He's good?
Yeah.
I gotta go work on the scanner...
Don't go.
No, no, no. I'm gonna be...
I'll be right outside the door.
All right? I'm just...
I'm gonna be right there...
I'll leave the door open
a little bit.
And I'll be able to
hear you if you call me.
I wanna go home.
But... that's why
I gotta, uh,
work on the scanner.
All right?
I'm gonna go
out there. Um...
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.
And...
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.
All right?
All right.
You gotta trust me, okay?
You gotta trust me.
You gotta...
Trust you. I trust...
You gotta...
I trust you.
I trust...
I can't hear you.
I trust you.
All right.
Give me a kiss.
Mwah.
I'll just be a little
while, okay?
All right.
I'll be right here.
Okay.
Can you still hear me?
Yeah.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Do you trust me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like that?
Yeah. Put that one...
Then you go like that.
Is that okay?
I don't know.
What do you think?
It's good.
Let's go.
Get your stuff.
Hey, why don't you leave it?
We can't.
We're gonna have
a different room later.
Go.
Hey, Chris.
Hey. Good morning,
Mr. Frakesh.
What's up?
Work trip.
Your wife, Martha,
works at PacBell also, correct?
Yes, she does.
And you guys are both looking
to retire at about
the same time?
We'd like to retire and
maintain the same lifestyle
without paying a lot of taxes.
So basically,
you don't want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?
Nobody's.
Are you familiar with
tax-free municipal...?

Eight dollars.
What's that?
Uh, it's to repair the light.
Can I see it?
Uh...
Yeah, sure.
Just... don't break it.

I don't mind.
Hm.
Yeah, you will.
Why don't you get

Yeah.

A hotel?
Well, just for the night.
We can go back to the cave
if you like.
Hm.
No, thank you.
Ever?
I-I hope not.
Why not?
Well, 'cause some things are fun
the first time you do 'em,
and then not so much the next.

Yeah. Like the bus.

How are you doing, Jay?
I'm doing fine.
Rumor has it you signed

from Pacific Bell.
Yeah, I, uh...

got some cards
I've been working.
I guess.
So... one more day.
Getting nervous?
No, I'm... I'm okay.
Yeah?
Listen, whatever happens...
you've done
a fantastic job, Chris.
I mean that.
Take care of yourself.
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.
Yes, sir. Just, uh, calling
to thank you very much
for your support
at last month's seminar.
Uh... Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely.
Yes, sir.
No, sir, that's it.
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
Chris.
Come.
Hi, Chris.
Mr. Frohm. Good to see you.
Nice shirt.
Heh. Thank you, sir.
Chris.
Hi, Jay.
Chris.
Chris. Sit down,
please.
I thought I'd, uh...
wear a shirt today.
Um... you know,
being the last day and all.
Well, thank you.
Thank you.
We appreciate that.
But, um...
wear one tomorrow though, okay?
Because tomorrow is going
to be your first day.
If you'd like to
work here as a broker.
Would you like that, Chris?
Yes, sir.
Good. We couldn't
be happier.
So...
welcome.
Was it as easy as it looked?
No, sir. No.
No, sir, it wasn't.
Well...
Good luck, Chris.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
