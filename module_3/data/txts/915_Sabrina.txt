Why, look at the time.
It's almost midnight.
Very nearly the witching hour.
Time enough
for one more story about Sabrina,
as she takes one more step
towards fulfilling
the Dark Lord's Prophecy.
It's a wonder anyone in Greendale
was surprised by what happened
the night of the "storm."
All the signs were there...
if you knew where to look.
<i>A dead bird brought in by a cat.</i>
<i>A spilled bottle of black ink.</i>
<i>A broken mirror in an empty room.</i>
<i>A loaf of bread split
clean down the middle.</i>
Bloody hell.
<i>A blind woman knits
her own death shroud,</i>
<i>aware of what's coming.</i>
Nana.
It's like you predicted.
I have started to see things.
Impossible things.
One of the things that I saw...
Any sign of Tommy?
I think my friend, Sabrina Spellman...
is a witch.
Could be.
Could very well be.
Nana, you said
that witches cursed us Walker women...
and that's why so many of us are blind.
So the story goes.
Was it a Spellman who cursed our family?
Oh, no, child.
Don't think such dark thoughts.
You know your friend.
You know in your heart
if she's good or bad,
and you don't need the cunning
to tell you that.
The thing is...
I'm not sure anymore.
Just look at her...
and you will know.
Besides...
what the cunning tells me is that...
your friend is not the witch
you need to fear.
The thirteen are coming, child.
Like the wrath of...
not God...
but something near as powerful,
only twisted.
The thirteen?
Witches.
And may the Lord have mercy on our souls.
Blast it!
Someone's having a baby.
What? What in Satan's name
are you talking about, Hilda?
You know the saying.
"If a spoon falls, a baby calls."
Probably Lady Blackwood's.
Kindly spare me
your old wives' tales, Sister.
Lady Blackwood's barely started
her fourth trimester. It'll be ages yet.
Where's Sabrina? Ambrose?
In her room, I believe.
Still?
It's been days.
Yeah, but considering
what she's been through...
I know exactly
what she's been through, Ambrose.
I was there to pick up the pieces,
wasn't I?
She has school.
People will start to talk.
Well, I've made her a little balm
for her broken heart.
- I'm gonna take it up to her.
- No, I will.
You can't stay in bed for the rest
of your life. You have school.
What if I see him, or he sees me?
It'll be too much.
Your Aunt Hilda's made you a balm.
To numb your heart.
Rub it in your chest three times daily,
or as needed.
I don't want to stop feeling.
I want to stop hurting.
No, that's wrong.
I want Harvey to stop hurting.
There's no balm for that.
If there were, we'd be as rich as Midas.
What am I gonna do, Aunt Zee?
Today, you'll go to school,
and you'll talk to your friends,
and you'll sit in class
and answer questions.
And then you'll go to the Academy.
Then you'll come home...
and we'll eat supper together.
And then you'll go to bed.
And your Aunt Hilda or I will sit
by your side until you fall asleep.
And tomorrow...
you'll do the same,
and it will hurt a tiny bit less.
And the next day, it will hurt even less.
After what I put Harvey through...
how can I ever face him again?
You...
I'm not sure.
I've never been where you are.
Perhaps you just do, Sabrina.
As bravely and as humbly as you can.
- Sabrina.
- Sabrina.
Roz. Susie.
What's going on?
What's going on with you?
Yeah, you look
a little freaked out, Sabrina.
I called you all weekend.
Me, too.
I wasn't, uh, feeling that great.
'Brina, we want...
- We need to ask you...
- Are you a witch?
What?
You guys, if this is some kind of joke?
It's not a joke.
The cunning showed me something.
A vision.
And... my Aunt Dorothea...
wrote about you in her journals.
She said the Spellmans were
a family of witches.
That's just...
That's just...
'Brina?
I wanted to tell you so many times, but...
but how could I?
- And now Harvey knows. Everything is...
- Harvey knows?
It's over.
- He broke up with me.
- What? Why?
Because of everything.
All the lying.
I've been hiding this whole other life,
going to this different school.
What do you mean?
For witches.
But I'm still the same person.
Even after what happened with Tommy.
- Sabrina?
- I did it.
I resurrected Tommy.
I wanted to help.
But then he came back all wrong, and...
it's all my fault, and Harvey...
Harvey had to kill him.
- Oh, my.
- Oh.
Sabrina...
I mean, he'll never forgive me.
I mean, how could he?
I'm so sorry.
I never wanted to lie to you or hurt you.
Any of you.
- That's all I've been doing.
- That's okay.
It's okay.
- We're here for you, Sabrina.
- We will always be here for you.
Thank you, guys. You're the best.
<i>I can't tell you
how disappointed I was to hear</i>
Sabrina's mortal friends rally around her.
Despite my every manipulation,
despite everything they'd learned
about Sabrina,
her friends would not be cleaved from her.
The Dark Lord was growing
impatient with me.
I needed to change tactics.
Introduce a threat to Greendale
that would compel Sabrina
to make certain choices
that would, in turn...
...force her to separate from them.
As for the threat, I...
had an idea or two...
or thirteen...
...buried right under our noses.
<i>But I would have to wait
until midnight, the witching hour.</i>
<i>And I would need a warm body.</i>
<i>There you go.</i>
Sabrina?
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
for how everything went down
with the resurrection.
How did you hear?
Bad news travels fast.
It's all anybody's talking about.
Your failed resurrection.
Thoughts and prayers.
Isn't that how the mortals put it?
How is the mortal?
His name is Harvey, and he is devastated.
We broke up.
You really love him, don't you?
That's the one thing I envy about mortals.
The way they can give themselves
to each other.
Witches are aces
at passion and lust, but...
when it comes to love...
true love...
not so much.
Why is that?
Our Dark Lord is a jealous lord.
He wants us to love him and only him.
Selfish, isn't it?
Yeah, but it would be easier in some ways.
Nah.
I'd trade all the witch-orgies
in the world
for what you and the mortal have.
Had.
You'll pull through this, Sabrina.
And if you need a shoulder to cry on...
That can't be good.
Steve. Stevie, slow down.
Hey, you asked me out, remember?
You suggested we come out to the woods.
That's true.
So stop playing hard to get.
Why are you virgins always so aggressive?
- What? I'm not a...
- Oh, Mr. Loomis.
I smell virgins
the way a rabid dog smells blood.
But don't be embarrassed.
A virgin suits my needs tonight.
I call out to the Greendale Thirteen!
To the witches hunted by mortals!
Betrayed by their own kind.
Hung from this tree by their necks.
Arise, Sisters. Arise.
Welcome back, ladies.
Where are we?
Greendale.
And the witching hour is upon us.
Tonight and tomorrow,
for one hour, from midnight to one,
you may walk the earth again...
to claim your revenge.
Go forth, Sisters.
Take to the sleeping streets.
Reacquaint yourself
with the town you so despise.
And then summon the butcher...
who will end Greendale, once...
and for all.
- Out of my way.
- Madame...
Thank you.
Hilda?
Do you feel that?
It's like a train going past a graveyard.
Who's there?
Show yourself.
I said, show yourself!
<i>Wake up, Susie.</i>
What the hell?
They've come back.
Who has, Aunt Dorothea?
The thirteen women,
hung to death as witches.
Women I brought to the New World
to live freely.
The same women I buried here on our land.
On our farm?
No one else would cut them down
from the hanging tree in the woods.
They deserved a place to rest.
Why are they back?
They were hunted and betrayed.
They should've been buried
by their own kind.
Among their own kind.
Wrathful.
They come for vengeance.
Is there any way to stop them?
We don't have to tramp
out into the woods after midnight
- just to get kinky.
- Ssh! That's not what this is.
I just want to show you my favorite spot.
I already know your favorite spot,
and it's right between your...
Favorite spot for moon-gazing, you ass.
Ambrose, what?
- What's going on?
- Don't you hear that?
What is that?
Over there. Look.
It's a circle of witches.
From our coven?
Gathering for what?
Sounds like...
a summoning spell.
They're calling forth something.
Ambrose, we should go.
Why? If they're witches,
they're our people.
They're probably out here
having a good time.
And what if they're not?
Warlock...
Take this warning to your masters
at the Church of Night.
It's okay, I promise.
<i>Tommy, stop it! Tommy!</i>
Hi.
Hi.
How are you, Harvey?
Better than my dad.
What did you tell him?
That Tommy did it.
To put himself out of his misery.
He just nodded and said,
"He was my Tommy."
Then we called the funeral home,
but not you guys, the one in Riverdale.
That makes sense.
Yeah.
I've been thinking about you nonstop,
Harvey.
I've wanted to call you so badly,
but I just thought that I shouldn't...
You know, it's funny...
knowing now that you're a...
a witch makes a lot of sense somehow.
There's so many things
I never understood before.
About you...
about us.
I thought maybe
I was just too stupid to understand.
No.
Harvey, it kills me
that you ever felt that way.
I just couldn't tell you before.
I should've trusted you.
I know that now.
You must really hate me.
I could never hate you.
Remember...
I promised you that on your birthday.
But every time I look at you,
all I can think about is my brother.
Hi. So sorry to interrupt.
Harvey, I'm so sorry
about your poor brother.
- Uh, thanks, Miss Spellman.
- What's going on, Aunt Hilda?
So, you need to come
to the Church of Night straight away.
Father Blackwood has called
an emergency meeting.
During the day?
Hm-mm. Bit of a crisis,
so if you could meet me there.
So sorry.
Your aunt, she wasn't really here,
was she?
No, she was... astral-projecting.
And the Church of Night?
Is our coven.
Right.
Well, it sounds like
you'd better get going.
- Harvey...
- I mean, you have to.
It's your coven.
Yeah.
But I hope we can talk some more.
When you're ready.
<i>Brothers and Sisters...</i>
last night I witnessed an omen.
As so many of you did.
A horrifying sign
that can portend only one thing.
The Fires of the Abyss
are being made ready.
The Pit is yawning beneath us.
The Dark Lord has seen
our contemptible weakness.
Our blatant disregard
for witch law and doctrine.
And Satan,
vengeful God that he is, plans...
...to punish us!
Father Blackwood!
It is not the Dark Lord's wrath
that has come for us,
it is... the Greendale Thirteen.
We stumbled upon them
in the woods last night.
They were performing some kind of ritual.
A summoning spell.
They bore into our minds. Bewitched us.
We're only alive because they wanted
us to deliver a message.
What message? Spit it out.
They've returned to visit Death
upon the town of Greendale.
Last night, they rose to call forth
their Crimson Avenger.
Tonight, on the witching hour, he rides!
Who rides, Ambrose?
What are you talking about?
The Red Angel of Death, Auntie.
The Thirteen will knock down
all the doors in town for him,
and in his wake,
the firstborn of Greendale,
both mortal and witch alike, will perish!
Silence! Silence!
You've done well to bring this to us,
Brother Ambrose,
but if it is the wrath of the Thirteen and
their messenger of Crimson Death we face,
I, your High Priest, will protect you.
With all due respect, Your Excellency,
and acknowledging
that I'm excommunicated, protect us how?
The coven will gather
within the walls of the Academy.
Fortified, bound
by our combined impenetrable magics,
we will stand together,
until the blood-red horseman
has passed through Greendale!
But what about the mortals?
The people of Greendale.
Let them run to their False God
and gnash their teeth and wail,
or whatever it is they do.
Brethren, be inside the Academy
by midnight...
or face the Thirteen...
and their avenging angel alone.
<i>I don't understand.</i>
Why would the Greendale Thirteen
be angry at us?
It's a bloody mess
what happened to the Greendale Thirteen.
The most ignoble chapter
of the Church of Night's history,
but it is our history,
and we cannot deny it.
After the witch trials of Salem,
all the witches
in this part of the country
were terrified.
Trouble was brewing in Greendale,
and people... mortals were identifying
and arresting witches,
including the original Thirteen.
And while they sat in their cell,
the other witches met and decided...
The Thirteen would be sacrificed.
To appease the mortals' blood-lust.
While those thirteen women were tortured
and hung,
the rest of the witches...
burned their poppets
and buried their cauldrons.
They were scapegoats
to quell the rising witch hysteria.
The coven could have come together
to save the Thirteen, but they...
We, our ancestors...
decided not to risk it.
So we're all descendants of the witches
who turned their backs on the Thirteen
and let them die? No wonder they hate us.
And the mortals that did the actual
hunting and hanging, to be fair.
Well, you'd better believe
that I am not abandoning my friends
to go hide
in some magical doomsday bunker.
And before you even try
to stop me, Auntie Zee...
On the contrary, I think we should
all stay and protect the town.
- Really?
- I didn't expect that.
And why not?
The Greendale Thirteen were sacrificed
so that the pack might survive.
But we need not make
the same mistake again.
We are Spellmans.
That means we stand tall, with dignity,
and we do what is right.
As your father always did, Sabrina.
The mortals may be weak,
but they do not deserve this grim fate.
Doom has been unleashed by witches.
It must be averted by witches.
All right, but protect them how?
We can hardly be all places at once.
We can't protect the whole town.
We can if we do the same
as Father Blackwood is doing.
We gather the mortals together.
Zelda, I think I might have the answer.
Dr. Cerberus told me something.
He used to be the local weatherman.
- Oh, for Satan's sake!
- Um...
He said that in the event of a tornado
or severe weather,
that the town's designated shelter was
Baxter High basement.
That's a great idea, Aunt Hilda.
All we need is a tornado.
That's easy enough.
Boreas, North Wind, I summon you.
Euros, East Wind, I summon you.
Notos, South Wind, I summon you.
Zephuros, West Wind, I summon you.
Is it working? How will we know?
Give it a moment.
Pray to Satan the mortals
heed the warning.
And for the most part, they did.
<i>The mortals of Greendale gathered</i>
<i>to take refuge
in the bowels of Baxter High.</i>
All right. All right.
Easy does it. Nice and slow.
That's it. There's plenty of room
for all in the storm shelter.
Don't you find this invigorating,
Ms. Wardwell?
I've always been fascinated
by tornadoes myself,
ever since <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>
And now, here we are.
Our school, the only safe place
in Greendale.
I'm engorged with excitement.
Mr. Hawthorne...
Perhaps, when all this is over,
you and I might finally have that drink?
Father Blackwood?
- All are accounted for.
- Splendid.
With our collective energies,
we shall prevent the witches
or their Red Angel
from crossing our threshold.
All save the Spellmans.
None of them are here.
Not even Ambrose.
Pity.
I had hopes for that boy.
Never mind.
He made his choice.
Susie, have you seen Harvey?
No, and I saw Roz's dad,
but I don't think Roz is here, Sabrina.
- I'll go to Harvey's.
- I'll go to Roz's.
But, Susie, you have to be back
before midnight.
Why aren't you at school?
Didn't you hear the siren?
I did, but we've got a storm cellar,
and my dad's in no shape to travel,
- so we're gonna stay here.
- Harvey, you can't.
It's not a tornado that's coming,
it's something much, much worse.
You must mean witches.
Yes, and then something called
the Red Angel of Death.
- But we can protect you.
- You?
Witches will protect me
and my dad from other witches?
That's okay. I appreciate the offer,
but I'll protect myself.
I'll protect my dad,
and I'll protect this house.
- Harvey, now is not the time...
- It's what Tommy would've done.
You've gotta understand why I don't want
to rely on witches for my protection now.
- No, I know...
- Please don't fight me on this, 'Brina.
I said, I'm staying.
I'm done being a coward.
My Nana Ruth doesn't want to go,
and I can't leave her alone.
But everyone's at the school, Roz.
There's a tornado coming.
Child, please.
We're Walker women.
We're cunning women.
We know what's coming,
and it ain't a tornado.
It's witches, Susie.
And... a man dressed in red
on a white horse.
Even more reason for you to be
at Baxter High with the rest of us.
Listen here, young man.
I have spent the better part of 30 years
sitting in this chair.
I don't see any reason to leave now.
Roz?
I'm sorry, Susie.
Then I'm staying, too.
Susie.
I'm staying, Roz.
It's what Dorothea would do.
It's what she would want me to do.
I know it.
Sabrina, where have you been?
The mortals are down in the shelter,
and it's almost the witching hour.
I went to Harvey's, and then I had
to make a detour to call in a favor.
A favor? Of whom?
Hey. Harvey, right?
- Yeah. Who are you?
- I'm Nick Scratch.
Sabrina sent me. I'm a friend of hers
and your back-up for the night.
So I'll need you to show me every window
and door in this house,
so I can seal and bind them for you.
What kind of friend?
<i>Qui affecto protego,</i>
<i>mixtisque iubas serpentibus</i>
<i>et posteris meis stirpiqu.</i>
<i>Qui affecto protego,</i>

<i>Qui affecto protego,

- You gonna do something here?
- I'm doing it, farm boy.
Not that you deserve it.
You're a witch hunter, aren't you?
She still loves you.
<i>Qui affecto protego,
mixtisque iubas serpentibus</i>
<i>et posteris meis stirpiqu.</i>
Susie...
did you see that?
My name is Susie Putnam.
Blood of Dorothea Putnam,
who gave you passage across
the ocean when no one else would,
who cut you down from the hanging tree
when no one else would.
The Walkers are my friends.
Please don't hurt them.
It's working, isn't it?
The protection spell, Aunt Zelda?
Yes, as long as we four
remain focused, it just might.
Faustus, you brought me here?
- I did, Sister Zelda...
- I have to go back. My family needs me.
Your sworn duty is here, Zelda!
Lady Blackwood has gone into labor.
Damn you, Faustus.
I'll need clean towels, fresh water,
and Prudence.
- Prudence?
- Yes, I'll need help,
and this is no place for a man.
And that very much includes you.
Yes.
You'll be just fine.
Where did Aunt Zelda go?
What is happening?
Can the protection spell hold
with just three of us?
It's a bit dodgy, but if three of us just
pick up the slack and no one else disap...
No!
Luke, what am I doing here?
I teleported you here.
It's no use trying to leave.
I've bound you to the Academy,
and you have to stay.
- Why? Why would you do this?
- Because you belong here with us now,
with your own kind,
safe inside these walls,
standing with the coven
with your warlock brothers.
With me, Ambrose.
- No. You don't understand. I have to...
- No, <i>you </i>don't understand!
I couldn't leave you out there
to die, Ambrose.
Because I love you.
The witches are getting stronger
out there, I can sense it.
Ms. Wardwell,
it's just me and Aunt Hilda now.
I'm fading, love.
I don't think I can hold out much longer.
Sabrina, if you and your Aunt
can't maintain the spell,
the Thirteen will throw open
every door and window.
The mortals will be unprotected
when the Red Angel arrives,
and there will be no escaping his sword.
Pitch in at any time.
I fear we would still falter
before the witching hour ends.
Then there's the matter of Mr. Kinkle,
Miss Putnam, Miss Walker.
They're out there,
facing their own personal assaults.
No, the time for defense is over.
It's time to go on the offensive.
How would we even do that?
As a matter of fact, I have an idea,
but it would mean your Aunt Hilda here
holding down the fort alone for a bit.
- Alone? Bloody hell!
- Sabrina, we are running out of time.
Fine, let's do it. Aunt Hilda, hold on.
Salem, stay here and watch Aunt Hilda.
Just do it, Salem!
I'll be back as soon as I can.
<i>In the end,
there was only one way to accomplish</i>
<i>what the Dark Lord wanted.</i>
Make it so that Sabrina would have
no other option.
There would only be one path
to save the mortals.
The Path of Night.
<i>And so we went
back to the clearing in the woods,</i>
<i>where this story first began
16 years ago.</i>
Wait...
Ms. Wardwell,
this is where my Dark Baptism...
...almost but not quite took place.
Ms. Wardwell...
what is the <i>Book of the Beast </i>doing here?
The kind of...
power you'll need
to save Greendale will...
require you to...
Sign my name?
Exchange my freedom for power?
I already said no to this, Ms. Wardwell.
This is what your father
and mother wanted for you.
That wasn't a lie your aunties told you.
The circumstances, you must agree,
have changed.
You're not the same girl,
not the same witch you were
the night of the...
ill-fated baptism.
You have the potential
to be the greatest witch
of your generation.
There is a cost that comes with that.
There has to be another way.
There's not one I can think of.
You must sign.
It's the only way you'll ever
be strong enough to stop...
That's him now.
The Red Angel of Death.
Can you hear him?
I know you're scared, Sabrina.
Because all women are taught
to fear power.
Own your power.
Don't accept it from the Dark Lord.
Take it. Wield it.
Save your friends.
Ms. Wardwell...
You've all but signed already.
But...
What's more important?
That pissing contest with the Dark Lord,
or the salvation of your friends?
If I sign...
It is your destiny.
If you do not, Harvey will die.
Rosalind and Susie will die.
Your aunts and your cousin will die.
I will die.
Please, Sabrina...
for all our sakes.
I'll sign.
Do you do this of your own free will?
And do you understand what it means?
When I call on you, girl, you must answer.
<i>I shall deliver Sabrina unto you.</i>
<i>Mom? Dad?</i>
<i>Oh, my child, you have
no idea how special you are, do you?</i>
<i>There's no flying in my life...</i>
<i>without you.</i>
<i>You must sign the </i>Book of the Beast!
<i>I can't do this.</i>
<i>Sabrina Spellman
shall retain her mortal life,</i>
<i>on the condition that she also attend
the Academy of Unseen Arts.</i>
<i>- Are you ready to meet your fate?
- Prudence, please.</i>
<i>I'm begging you, leave me alone.</i>
<i>There's not a hope
in hell of that, half-breed.</i>
<i>How am I ever going to outwit
the Dark Lord?</i>
<i>Your parents died because of you.</i>
<i>How's that feel?</i>
<i>Not to have faith in anything?</i>
<i>Mom, it's me.</i>
<i>They took my baby after the baptism.</i>
<i>They told me she had died.</i>
<i>It's better to forget the mortal world.</i>
<i>Harvey, please. Let me stay.
Let me at least help...</i>
<i>No, Sabrina. You've...</i>
You've done enough.
You have to go.
<i>Everything has a price.</i>
<i>Edward learned that lesson.</i>
<i>It's your turn now.</i>
Sabrina. Breathe. Let it in.
- Can you feel it? Do you feel it.
- Yes.
- We don't have much time.
- Where...
Where do we go now?
What do we do to stop the Thirteen...
and the Red Angel?
Not we, you.
The power is yours, not ours.
Where do I go?
- What do I do?
- Don't you know, Sabrina?
Hasn't the Dark Lord already shown you
what to do?
What are you...?
I don't...
I was at the Hanging Tree.
Where the witches died.
It was on fire.
We're nearly there, Lady Blackwood.
One more push.
And here comes your first...
What is it?
Nothing. You're doing fine,
Lady Blackwood.
Just think of how proud
the High Priest will be.
Is he all right, my son?
Strong and fine, Lady Blackwood.
Sister Spellman,
Lady Blackwood's bleeding too much.
We'll fix her right up.
My babies... Sister Zelda, my babies.
They must be preserved...
...at all costs.
Hilda, there you are.
Dr. Cee?
What are you doing?
You should be downstairs.
I got so worried.
I'm saying a little prayer
against the tornado.
Do you need me to stay?
Just hold my hands. Just for a minute.
Will that help?
It can't hurt, can it?
Susie, what happened? What did you do?
I have no clue.
Maybe she just got tired and went home?
No, children.
She left.
She left...
because it's his turn now.
The Crimson Rider.
The Angel of Death.
Can't you hear him?
That horse of his?
- What the hell is that now?
- That, mortal, is the main event.
The Doom of Greendale.
You're not your father's
firstborn son, are you?
No, that would have been Tommy.
What about your father?
He's the firstborn son, yeah.
How do I do it, Ms. Wardwell?
Dig deep.
It isn't just power, Sabrina.
It's rage.
It's the desire to change the world...
and the will to do it.
Command the Greendale Thirteen.
I order the Greendale Thirteen to stop!
Go in peace, or face my wrath!
Is that it? Has the storm passed?
No, it just got here.
Tell me. You're not the firstborn
in your family, are you?
Oldest of three boys.
Hear me, hear me. Run away.
Live to see another day.
Run! Go! I will be right behind you.

Who are you to order us?
We felt the wrath of Greendale once,
child.
- We won't be hung again.
- No, not hung.
Burned.
Burn us, half-witch?
We are not of this Earth.
No earthly fire can burn us.
No, not earthly fire.
Hellfire.
None but the most powerful
can summon it: Devils.
And in the history of witches,
only three...
Well, it's about to be four.
I, Sabrina Spellman,
daughter of Edward Spellman,
Child of Night, call forth...
Fire from the Pit.
<i>Ater ignus, fusce fume.</i>
<i>Te evoco ut potentium tuam monstres.</i>
<i>Cupidibus flammis hic veni.</i>
<i>Caelo sub isto, harc arborem consumo.</i>
<i>Lucem tenebrasque tuas monstra.</i>
<i>Impetuum tuum evoco ad devorandum.</i>
<i>Hanc arborem ac omnes hospitas devora.</i>
<i>And then they went up in hell flame.</i>
<i>A gorgeous, searing inferno...</i>
<i>consumed their souls.</i>
Releasing their anger...
until their charred bodies
<i>fell from the sky...</i>
<i>like ash.</i>
<i>And once the witches</i>
<i>who summoned
the Red Death were gone,</i>
<i>and the wrath
that fueled him dissipated,</i>
<i>the Angel, too...</i>
<i>simply vanished</i>
<i>as though he was never there.</i>
<i>And just like that,
the witching hour was over.</i>
And most everyone had survived the storm,
little knowing how close
to annihilation they'd come.
What happened tonight?
I'm pretty sure your girlfriend just saved
the entire town.
She's not my girlfriend.
Not anymore.
Why did you show up here?
She asked me, so I came.
No, but...
why?
Are you...
- Are you, guys...
- She loves you, mortal.
She'd die for you.
Maybe that's worth forgiving her.
Faustus, I'm sorry, but you were right.
Lady Blackwood was too weak
to bring your baby into the world.
Baby? I thought you said twins.
Something strange
but not unheard of happened.
One of your sons, the dominant one...
consumed the other,
the submissive one, in the womb.
There is only one son...
fortified by the brother he consumed.
As it should be.
Let me hold him.
My only begotten son...
and heir!
I don't know what you said in that prayer
tonight, but it certainly worked.
All the clouds are cleared.
It's going to be a beautiful day,
Hilda Spellman.
Goodnight.
What happened to you earlier?
Doesn't matter.
All's well that ends well, I suppose.
Hilda...
Yes?
I've done something rather impulsive.
Did you make a magic baby?
It's Lady Blackwood's.
Hm?
A girl. I lied to Father Blackwood.
I said he only had one child.
Why?
To protect the babe, Hilda.
She's a girl, born before her brother.
And the High Priest,
I feared what he would've done to her.
But we can raise her.
We've done it before.
We'll keep it a secret, you and I.
Together, as sisters.
Forever and ever!
I'm moving out.
What?
I'm moving out... of this bedroom.
I think it's time I had a room of my own.
The Church of Night is ours, boys.
This is the Dark Lord's sign.
His blessing...
that we are in the right.
Hail to my firstborn son.
Hail Judas!
Hail Judas! Hail Satan!
Hail Judas! Hail Satan!
Hail Judas! Hail Satan!
Hail Judas!
You... changed your hair.
Yeah.
Thanks for sending that guy, Nick.
He...
He said you saved the whole town tonight.
Well, it was a group effort.
I wanted to check on you.
And apologize again, Harvey.
For all the secrets, for Tommy.
For everything.
I truly am sorry.
I know.
I know you are.
So, what if you we start over?
No more secrets this time. We just...
I don't...
I don't think that's such a good idea.
I don't know if it's safe...
for me to be around you.
Or Roz...
or Susie.
Why not?
I had to do something tonight...
that scares me.
Harvey...
it touched something...
dark inside me.
I love you too much to risk
anything bad happening to you.
Can I...
Can I get one last kiss?
<i>And that, as they say...</i>
<i>was that.</i>
All things according to his plan.
Though I never really get
the credit I deserve.
The best and worst things...
happen in the shadows.
Well, this is all a very long-winded way
of my telling you that...
I'm an amazing teacher,
Principal Hawthorne.
No one but me could've gotten Sabrina
so far along the Path of Night.
Who the hell are you, lady?
Who am I?
Well, I'm not Mary Wardwell...
though I do enjoy her body.
I'm the Mother of Demons,
the Dawn of Doom,
Satan's concubine.
I'm Lilith, dear boy.
First wife to Adam,
saved from despair by a fallen angel.
I call myself Madame Satan in his honor.
But soon...
very soon...
I'll have a new title.
You see...
once I finish grooming Sabrina
to take my place as Satan's foot-soldier,
I'll earn a crown
and a throne by his side.
Who am I?
I'm the future Queen of Hell.
I did so leave you leftovers.
Oh, stop squawking, and just say it.
Forgive me, madame,
but doesn't it seem
that Satan is grooming Sabrina
to reign at his side, not you?
But the Dark Lord wouldn't betray
my eternal service like that, Stolas.
Even if he would,
there would be a very simple way
to deal with Sabrina.
She's still Sabrina, Harvey.
She's still the girl we know.
I don't know, Susie.
Something had changed,
and not just her hair.
But she's still coming to school, right?
I mean, we're still her friends?
