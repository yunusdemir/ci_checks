- How long did you work here?
- Ages. I worked in 5 bars.
I started there.
Las Vegas.
- Angelique, were they the rooms?
- Yes, they were.
- Did you live there too?
- I lived up and down the street.
- You lived where you danced.
- That's right.
Especially when she was pissed.
I was pleased to stop though.
Alright, girls?
Come over later.
We can party!
Go to bed.
You've had too much
to drink, Angelique.
- I'm off.
- Bye, honey. See you tomorrow.
Have a good night.
Go to bed.
Be careful.
Yes. Bye, girls.
Go on.
Come on.
Walk.
Come on.
Pain in the ass!
I know where my room is.
Give me a break.
Come with me.
Quietly.
You can go.
Get into bed.
Looks like Angelique
had a long night!
I partied.
Did you dance a lot?
Way too much.
Too much?
Come on, let's carry on.
You'll see,
we'll make you feel better.
Number 49!
We'll wake her up gently.
Swing your hips, come on.
What can I do?
Stand naked on the bar?
Excuse me.
Does Michel Heinrich live here?
- Downstairs.
- Thanks.
Come on, sit down.
I wasn't expecting you.
Don't stress, Michel.
It's Ok. I can wait.
- Fancy a coffee?
- Yes. Why not?
I honestly don't know what to say.
I'm stunned.
When I look at you, well...
What's so funny?
- You're making me blush.
- Come on!
I'm so pleased to see you.
- Did you miss me?
- Of course, or I wouldn't be here.
Ever wonder why
I stopped coming?
I don't know.
I don't really feel
like coming to the bar.
Why?
To be honest,
I don't like it anymore.
No. Really...
I feel like I have to pay
to see you.
Every time I buy
a bottle of champagne
I don't want us to be apart.
You know full well
I have no choice.
I know it isn't your fault,
but try to understand me too.
I'd like you to come back.
I need to see you.
The other punters
aren't like you.
We could see each other
outside too, no?
I'm unhappy too,
when I don't see you.
I want to do lots with you.
Do you see?
Go out with you, have a laugh,
like a normal couple.
We sleep together...
We eat together...
- We fart together.
- Hey.
Well, why not?
Don't exaggerate, Ok?
It was just to get you to unwind.
It relaxes me every time.
Speak for yourself!
Claudia, you've no sauce...
Angelique...
here's a chair for you.
And for Tatiana too.
Thanks.
Tatiana, do you want lots?
You're not hungry?
You stuff yourself.
- Right, see you then.
- Ok.
See you later.
Hey. Angelique,
where are you going?
- Didn't you hear me?
- What?
Who are you going out with?
I want to know.
Don't put on too much,
or you'll look ugly.
Hey Jenny!
Did I ask you anything?
You're my mate. It's normal!
You're doing my head in, Ok?
Hi André.
- You Ok?
- Fine. How about you?
Angelique.
Hit!
Zero.
Zero.
Hit!
Second.
One.
Second.
Here, for instance,
my team won the championship.
See?
Here, see,
I finished second, just behind...
Stop showing off, you!
It's true. He scored,
and now he's full of himself.
And here, look.
Ten kilos lighter.
It's my treat, lads.
I'll get the round in.
Thanks a lot!
Anything for friends.
- He's generous today.
- He's happy. It's normal.
He's really tight usually!
Don't you have
a friend for me? A nice girl
about my age
to go out with
and have a bit of fun.
My girlfriends all work
at the bar and they're difficult.
That's for sure.
They're a pain in the neck.
Isn't there a nice one like you?
- A pretty girl?
- Give it a go.
That's all I can say.
- Here, Enza.
- See? He hasn't forgotten me.
Let me hold you.
Let me hug you a bit.
Now I'm going to
tell you something.
You'd better not laugh.
Please marry me.
Don't be daft!
I love you.
You laughed.
You come out with it like that!
I mean it.
You know,
I'll never leave you again.
You don't even know me.
- You might be disappointed.
- I know you better than you think.
I know you off by heart.
We don't have much time left.
It goes too fast.
I want to go to France.
Goodbye then.
I expect an answer.
Where in France?
To Spicheren, please.
They buy champagne
and you know how it is.
The punters love us
and all that,
but it's just bullshit.
You know that.
We're not being mean.
We're giving you advice.
You know what I mean?
I'm just saying that Michel
is a very sweet, serious bloke.
And I reckon I could have
a nice life with him.
He's kind!
When you say someone's sweet...
I wouldn't like someone
to say that I'm sweet!
I'm going to take a photo
of this moment
and we'll discuss it again
next week.
Hey, the little virgin!
- Tequila.
- Tequila for everyone!
One, two, three.
She's a wild one!
Who cares!
I don't feel like sleeping.
One, two, three.
Cheers!
It's very good
after drinking champagne.
You have a shot, go to bed
and crash out, you'll sleep all day.
Like we don't already!
- Hey Rudy!
- What?
A round on the house!
You'll fall off your stool.
- I'm hanging on to it!
- Last orders.
Just a shot.
- Cheers!
- I've had enough.
- Let's put the baby to bed.
- The baby!
- She's a big fat baby.
- Yeah!
What are you afraid of?
What's stopping you?
I'm scared it's a big mistake.
- It isn't easy either.
- That's true.
But there comes a point
when you have to say stop.
It'll be weird not to work.
You should make an effort too.
I think Michel is expecting you
to prove things to him too,
which is only normal.
- For sure.
- It's logical. I'm right, aren't I?
It's a first for me.
For us too, it's a first.
He knows what's what.
He knows about the club world.
Think of yourself a bit.
- He's a good guy.
- I know he's a good guy.
I'm going to miss
this little doggy too!
You'll see him again.
Visit whenever you like.
Tell Angelique
she can come whenever she likes.
Come on, Michel.
Mind your back.
I'm sad.
Goodbye, honey.
We're going to miss you.
I'm going to miss you. All of you.
Enza, you too,
even if I shouted at you a lot.
Everyone keep still. Again?
- Another one.
- The last shot!
Great.
Wait, you!
What's your problem?
A group hug.
We won't let her go!
Ok. You have to go now.
- Angelique...
- We're going to miss you.
What's wrong?
I wasn't expecting
to see you in that outfit.
- Why?
- A bar hostess...
I thought you'd have less on.
- Do you want me to change?
- No.
I'm surprised that's all.
You're beautiful.
You're a bit nervous, huh?
I'm a bit nervous too.
I'll go get us a drink, shall I?
It'll help us unwind.
Stop.
Stop!
Come on, you lot!
Nathy, get a move on.
This is for you.
Aly, Nathy...
Mérésia...
When I last saw them,
they were tiny.
- There are dinosaurs.
- Cool!
Chatz, bring me the sausages.
Uncle!
- Hello!
- What a welcome!
That's for sure.
- You Ok?
- Yeah, and you?
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Alright?
- Yes. This is Michel.
- Mario.
- Hello.
- What do you want to drink?
- A Coke.
I'm pleased you came.
- Are you working?
- Yes. Of course.
Since when?
- For a year or so.
- That's good.
- Got a girlfriend?
- Not at the moment.
Where do you work?
- At Egerland.
- The haulage company. I know it.
What do you do?
- Night watchman.
- Right.
And you?
I'm retired.
I'm taking it easy.
You are, huh?
And before that?
I was a miner.
- Pit or office?
- The pit.
Simon Colliery.
Have you heard of it?
Like my dad.
- What's his name?
- Daniel Jung.
I knew some Jungs.
What did he do?
I don't have a clue.
Do you know, Mum?
He worked days.
That's all I remember.
- You don't even know?
- Look,
he did something,
but he wasn't in the pit.
You too,
you could have asked your dad.
Forget it!
You know,
I didn't care what he did.
As long as he didn't hassle her,
it was cool.
Plus I was working. So...
Michel, tell them
how you proposed to me.
- Oh no!
- Come on, they're my kids.
Don't you...
Don't you get embarrassed!
You know Mario and Séverine.
- Tell them!
- Yes, well...
- Come on, it's funny.
- You really want to know?
- Yeah, go on.
- I looked kind of stupid.
Show them.
Right. I got down like this.
Look carefully.
On my knees. I opened...
"What a pretty ring," she said.
"Is it for me?"
"I've something to ask you."
"Really? What?"
And I said,
"Angelique,
"will you marry me?"
- She started laughing.
- No!
Seriously?
- She was tired.
- Tired or drunk?
Yeah, well, I didn't want...
I thought it was a joke,
but I said yes anyway.
Here's the proof!
Which one is it?
This one!
It's easy to tell!
The stone?
Look.
- This one?
- No.
- That one?
- Yes.
- You're having me on!
- Have you told Sam?
Not yet.
We haven't set the date.
You still should've told him.
- He'll be livid.
- I need the date first.
- Yes, but...
- Tell him you want to get married.
At least talk to him.
- Afraid he won't like me?
- No. It isn't that.
He wants to decide everything.
We'll see if you like that.
I can't wait to meet him.
And Cynthia?
I don't want to talk about her.
But you will tell her?
How do you expect me
to contact her?
Who's Cynthia?
She's my daughter.
Your mummy's sister.
You'll have to call her
one of these days.
Give me a break.
Don't hassle me about her.
I don't want to discuss it.
In any case,
she's never got in touch
or sent me a card.
She's never called me.
She didn't abandon you.
- I didn't either.
- But she thinks you did.
No, that's what you think.
They took her
and put her in care. Period!
Stop telling me what to do,
for fuck's sake!
Hey! The children.
So what?
You're getting on my tits.
I say I'm getting married
and you talk about Cynthia.
What is this?
You've got a problem!
Here's the coffee.
I'll put it here.
Have you known each other long?
Over two years now.
Quite a while.
If you don't mind my asking,
how did you first meet?
It's important in a relationship.
It's something you remember.
Actually,
I'm not sure I should say.
You've put me on the spot.
It's best to open about things.
We met in an escort club.
You met in a club?
That isn't...
It's a place to meet people,
but it's true
it's a little peculiar too.
And...
were you a regular?
Or did you go occasionally?
And have you worked there long?
Yes, a very long time.
What did this meeting
change for you?
It obviously meant something,
since you here.
Actually, it was him who...
- It was him who insisted?
- Yes.
But you were willing though.
But what made you think
you could live another way?
I think Michel is a good man.
I trust him.
I'm starting a new life with him.
And this trust made you think,
"I can change my life."
That's right.
Right, it's the middle of September.
When were you thinking of?
2 months"?
As soon as possible.
Want me to throw
my drink in your face?
You'd do that?
It's beautiful.
It's to thank you
for the wonderful day
you've given me today.
I'm pleased you like it.
Yours is burning longer.
It's my flame of desire for you.
See? It isn't even going out.
Is that it?
Come on.
- Hi. You Ok?
- Everyone's run off...
I'm waiting for you. Ok?
- How are you?
- Good. And you?
Yes. Fine.
Wow! You're doing alright.
Nice pad you've got.
- Huh?
- That's right.
I'm a married woman now.
I'm jealous.
It's nicer than my place.
I had a tiny room.
I'm happy.
I feel good here.
I'm not surprised.
I would too.
It's nice.
You've got a little garden.
It's what I've always wanted.
Come on.
The lounge.
Nathy, look!
Always with breasts.
With tits.
I won!
Here. Can you see?
Look, I've put angel everywhere.
If you like,
you can come and stay.
Do you like it?
- You're a real princess.
- I'm dying!
Nathy, do be careful on the bed.
With your shoes too...
Get off.
It isn't a trampoline.
Get out now.
Come on!
You'll break the bed!
Come on, get off.
Séverine, your kids are on the bed
with their shoes on.
Look at them.
Hey! Get off.
Hurry UP-
Mérésia, come on.
Nathy!
Get off!
Stop. Get off.
- Want to know what I'm writing?
- I can see.
Then?
"Please forgive me
for this long period of silence,
"but my circumstances..."
"my...
"...circumstances
did not allow me to fulfill
"my role as a mother."
What does that mean?
It means that you're not...
I want her to read me the letter.
- Want me to read it?
- No. I've read it.
What are you making me look like?
That's how you start.
You have to explain the situation,
why you're writing to her.
- Why tell her about my life?
She doesn't give a toss!
- You have to explain.
- We can write something else!
- What?
- What do you want to write?
Can't you find anything else?
Suggest something.
I would write
I'd love to invite her
to the wedding,
I have a flat
and there's room for her.
- Do you have feelings for her?
- Of course!
Put that in the letter then.
- You could...
- You know what?
I'm going to ask Sam.
Sam can do me the letter.
Alright then, we won't do it.
Michel, put the PC on.
We're going to call Sam.
- You want to call him now?
- Yes.
You haven't written to Cynthia?
No. I was too busy moving.
What are you waiting for?
Séverine and Mario wrote a letter
for me, but it's no good.
- You could even write a letter?
- It's her fault!
I don't like
with what they wrote.
Right...
"I am taking the liberty of writing,
"to announce my forthcoming wedding.
"I'd like, with your
Slow down a bit!
"I would like, with your kind
"Cynthia to be able to come."
You see?
It's good what he said.
Hang on, Mum.
Let us think.
"I sincerely wish to see her again."
Speak a bit to Cynthia too.
"I would be overjoyed
"if she could be with us.
I will let you speak to her,
"to give her the choice of coming."
"...the choice of coming."
I heard what he said. Damn!
What Sam said is better.
We'd have done the same thing...
Let's not discuss it for hours.
Just say that.
Try to write it properly.
I'll call you later and I'll check
for mistakes, alright?
Ok. Thanks, Sam.
Ok. See you later.
Take care.
"I would like,
with your kind permission,"
"Cynthia to be able to come."
Everyone from both sides
of the border,
welcome to the border bridge
for the 28th...
Aly!
Very cute, huh?
We play abroad.
Sometimes in France.
You play in France?
That's good.
Since you played so well
and you're so charming,
I'd like to buy you a drink.
I can't accept.
I'm with my colleagues.
You can't do that to me!
I can't leave her for 5 minutes!
Can I at lease have
a photo of the two of us?
- A photo, alright.
- Thanks!
A souvenir, Ok?
- You're having fun!
- I just posed for a snap.
I'll bring a lead next time.
Cheers!
A very short one!
Or I'll let my dogs loose.
You said I was a night owl.
See?
Cheers.
It isn't important.
Ow, Michel!
- You're a big brute.
- No, I'm not.
Goodnight.
Go to sleep!
Behave yourself, Ok?
She's a prude.
Reminds me of a nun.
Right...
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
I'll pinch your bum a bit more.
Your feet.
- Shall I push her?
- I'll push her.
- There?
- Yes.
- Do we have any cocoa?
- Yes.
The Kellogg's are there.
Crackers.
All those years
I worked in different clubs...
Las Vegas, Cascade,
and Palais Madame,
they never declared me.
I've got nothing now.
It's kind of normal.
If you always moonlighted,
what did you expect?
All I can get is solidarity benefit,
and it isn't much.
I went to see the social worker.
Know what she said?
"Listen. You have to work.
"I can offer you
a gardening job."
She's mad.
I could've slapped her.
It isn't funny, Séverine.
All you do is laugh!
- Put yourself in my shoes.
- I can picture you
on the roundabouts,
trimming hedges.
Hey, you!
All jobs are good, anyway.
Your daughter's
foster family called.
Really?
And what did they say?
It's you they wanted.
They didn't say anything?
I didn't dare them anything.
- It's important though.
- You have to call them.
Michel,
can't you call them for me?
Look...
I don't want to get involved.
I can't ask you anything!
She's your daughter.
- Alright?
- Fine.
It's freezing out there.
I've brought a bottle.
It's almost ready.
If the match stops,
we won't eat much pasta!
Tuck in, Ok?
Michel...
It's losing money.
Hardly anyone goes now.
Will you play poker
with us, Angelique?
- Why not?
- We can play strip poker.
Thanks.
Unbelievable!
She can't help herself.
- You used to smoke!
- It's her house.
- I gave up years ago.
- It doesn't bother me.
- I quit 10 years ago.
- You know the saying.
"Make yourself at home,
"but remember it's my home."
It's her home too.
You want to marry her,
but she's only allowed
to do the cleaning?
Not when we're eating!
When we went out to eat,
you used to smoke.
Can you put it out?
- Hey! Give me a break.
- She's right.
- For sure.
- At least that's clear.
I'm not sure I want to go.
Why?
She'll probably ask me
loads of questions.
That's all.
What kind of questions?
I can't find the thing now.
What questions?
She doesn't know who her dad is.
But you know though?
No, I don't know.
- You must have an idea!
- I don't know who it is.
You know,
I was young,
I partied an awful lot.
There.
- You really don't know who it is?
- No.
You can't run away again!
You'll have to explain
to her one day.
Thank you.
- Want a bit, Auntie?
- A tiny bit.
I got your letter
and I told Cynthia about it.
She was surprised...
and happy-
So she agrees.
I'm so pleased.
She'll meet
her 2 brothers and her sister,
who she hasn't seen
for a very long time.
We were her substitute family, but...
this is an opportunity for her
to get to know you.
She's sixteen.
She has lots of plans.
I don't want to take her away.
I just wanted you to know
that I have room
for her to stay a few days,
or a week,
so I can get to know her.
And it'll be good
for all of us.
I still picture you
as a little 6-year-old girl,
but I can see you've become
a beautiful young lady.
Honestly,
I'm astonished, Mrs. Dechuet,
to see her like this.
I'm very proud too,
to see her like this.
Me too, I'm proud of her.
Whenever I saw a girl like her,
I'd start crying.
And have to leave.
I'd say to myself,
"I could have with ma,
but I don't have her.
She was taken away from me.
I think she believes
I abandoned her.
But I didn't.
She's always been in my heart.
She was my little girl
I always had with me.
But she can't dance.
- Have you seen her?
- Who are you talking about?
That stuck-up girl?
- Thanks.
- I don't like her.
She's blonde
and has a kind of bob.
Doesn't she? A bob.
She's a silly cow, for sure.
Well!
I could tell by the way she walked
that she couldn't dance.
She's a student,
she should have stayed at school!
She's in the wrong place!
She's pretty though, shapely...
I'm pretty too.
We're all pretty.
- She's young.
- I don't care!
I'm young too.
What do you take me for?
You don't miss the club?
That's a laugh!
Sorry, but she's lying to us.
Come on, tell us another one!
I honestly don't have time
to think about it.
Oh yeah?
Because I'm busy planning
the wedding and all that.
I go see my grandchildren.
No time to get bored.
Look, how big the house is.
You need a cleaning lady.
Look at you.
Your nails weren't like that before.
Well?
There's so much to do here.
Are you happy?
That's what we want to know.
- He makes me laugh.
- That's good.
There's a problem though,
because at night,
when I go to bed,
he wants to kiss me,
and I just freeze.
What do you mean?
I just can't do it.
I don't feel at ease.
What? Come on,
give us the details.
Well, I don't feel...
I don't feel good.
- Like I said...
- About what?
- Does he have a problem?
- I've got a problem.
- You've got a problem?
- What's wrong?
- Can't you do it?
- No.
That isn't normal.
And he hasn't said anything?
He hasn't...?
Well, he's a sweet guy.
He said, "Oh well, I'll wait."
I didn't want him
to rush things.
So I'm making him wait.
"Not before the wedding."
You haven't slept with him,
but surely you cuddle?
Have you given him a blow-job?
Things that are part of sex,
but not intercourse?
- Nothing?
- You've not touched him?
It'll be okay.
Don't look so glum.
Don't be shy!
She can't be
on her wedding night.
I already told you.
It'll be hot!
You'll run all over the place, girl.
Where are you going?
- We're off now.
- Yes.
Can't we stay a bit longer?
The kid's asleep.
Sure you don't want to stay?
No. They're tired.
Aren't you, kids?
- Yes.
- I've a way to drive.
- Michel, we're staying, huh?
- If you like.
Right. Goodbye then.
- Drive safely.
- You too.
- It's a pity.
- Bye, Seb. See you soon.
One time,
end of the night. Amazing!
On the table she was,
dancing with her shoulders.
Her bra flew off.
Her tits were out.
That's was the end.
You know what?
Let's go the club,
to see my pals. How about it?
No, that's it.
We're going home.
- We've had enough to drink.
- Don't you want to go?
My wife let me go out,
I've made the most of it.
I can't take the piss.
- He means it.
- He's not kosher.
No. Come on.
It's been ages.
We can party at the bar.
- Please!
- There'll be other occasions.
We're going home.
Right... Michel,
it was great to meet you.
- See you again. Likewise.
- See you soon.
Angelique...
have a good night.
Every happiness.
A good night?
We're off home.
What's up with you?
- I'm tired.
- Go home then.
Watch your telly.
You've had enough to drink.
No. I just want
to carrying on partying.
I've paid all day...
For you, for your kids.
Why are you saying that?
That's enough!
- Is that all you ever do?
- Why are you criticizing me?
You're the one criticizing me!
You're mad at me
because of our family day?
We're leaving. That's it.
It's time to go.
I'm not coming home.
You're not, are you?
- You're coming home with me.
- Don't touch me.
Don't talk to me like that!
Now listen to me.
No one has ever
ordered me about before.
And I won't let you.
Is that clear?
Go see your pals. I've had it.
Go back to your whorehouse!
- Hello.
- Alright?
Good. And you?
- I like young guys.
- Your name?
You want to know my name?
It's Angelique.
Angelique?
Good to meet you.
- Not bad.
- Thanks.
- Look at this.
- That feels good.
Enjoy. Feel free.
I love it too.
I like women
with a bit of mileage.
Experienced women, you mean.
You've found the right girl.
- What do you want?
- I want to stroke you.
We need a private room.
Let's go then.
Alright then,
but you have to buy a bottle.
I'm not paying for it.
You should be paying me.
Gonna suck me off?
- Come on, suck me off.
- Don't talk that way!
Spread your legs
and I'll give you one.
Stop, or I'll slap you in the face.
If it's a whore you want,
just go to Sarrebruck.
And you're funny too!
- You're the whore for me.
- I'm not a whore,
and I deserve respect.
Then work as a cashier.
- Stop! Don't touch me.
- Hey, chill.
You're a whore.
Who do you think you are?
Easy now.
Don't hit me. Bloody slag!
Get out of here.
In any case,
I don't want any of that.
- Get out!
- What's going on?
Get lost!
- Get out, I said!
- I'm not budging.
Teddy!
You can call Teddy,
I don't give a toss, Ok?
You and your mate leave.
What's the problem?
What do you take me for?
He's gone.
Let go of me!
- I'm well pissed off.
- Enough.
Have your drink and behave.
The party goes on.
- Fuck it!
- I said, that's enough.
- If you see...
- That's enough, I said!
You can close the bar!
Shut it!
Shut your mouth!
Don't start.
Calm down, Ok?
I'm asking you nicely.
You're a madam!
You just take the cash.
You've got dollar signs for eyes!
- Stop.
- I've had it. I'm gonna slap her.
Angelique, are you nuts?
Don't touch me.
Not when you're like that.
- Angelique, stop.
- Just fuck off!
- Stop.
- Teddy,
throw these bitches out.
I'm sick of the sight of them.
What's your problem?
- Don't you talk to me like that!
- You're nothing.
I was a superstar.
I was beautiful.
You just show your ass
and your tits.
Keep your mouth shut!
Just get out of here.
- The exit.
- This is my place.
It isn't your place.
Not anymore it isn't!
You're finished. Over.
She's the boss here.
She told you to get lost.
Get inside!
I'm gonna smash this in your face,
I'm gonna break your mug.
Well?
- Well...
- Well what?
Bloody whore!
There are no limits with you.
I don't get it.
You can't take drink.
You turn nasty, aggressive.
What's going on with you?
I waited up all night for you.
That's my fault?
I don't know.
At least explain to me.
I'd like to understand.
I don't remember what I said.
I don't remember a thing.
That's a good excuse.
When I don't drink,
I say all sorts then regret it.
- It isn't right.
- It's big,
but I thought it'd be good,
with all our guests.
In Forbach,
there isn't anything else.
You waited till the last minute.
You could have looked around.
Why did you wait for me?
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I can't see any speakers.
There's no sound system.
- You don't have one?
- No.
- It'll be hard to party.
- It was to do you a favor.
There's nothing else to be had.
It's the only weekend it's free.
It's all we have.
I'll give a call
to Petite-Rosselle or Stiring.
We'll find a venue.
Come on.
We'll work it out.
We'll find something.
He's in such a hurry.
It'll be Ok, no problem.
Don't worry.
In any case, it won't be here.
I like him.
I think he's nice.
And you?
We get on, he's a nice guy,
but I don't believe
in their fairytale.
- Why?
- I don't know.
It's just a feeling.
She's trying.
Let's encourage her.
- Or we'll have to deal with her.
- For sure.
We? You're in Paris.
Come on. Let's hide.
Sam! Mario!
They've gone and left us.
Give me your bag!
Daft buggers!
Do you want me
to have a heart attack?
Oh no!
Here, have your bag.
- God, honestly...
- Let's go.
Right...
I'm so pleased you came.
See you then.
- Ciao, Michel.
- Bye.
Show me your jewellery.
They're not bad.
Thanks.
There. I'm sorry it's like this.
It isn't like at home.
Your bedroom is beautiful,
big and has a double bed.
It's just a single.
- Do you like it?
- Yes.
It isn't...
We'll change it later.
I can fix it up however you like.
- Michel, let's leave her.
- Ok.
Get settled in.
Take your time.
- See you later, Cynthia.
- See you.
Help!
Here they are.
Aren't they beautiful!
They're beautiful.
Cynthia! Cynthia!
She's so tall!
I'd better get up.
- You Ok?
- Yes. And you?
Hello, madam!
- It's Auntie Cynthia.
- Mérésia.
Auntie Cynthia!
- Alright, Cynthia?
- Yes, fine.
- You've grown!
- Well, yeah.
- It's great to see you again.
- I'm really pleased too.
It's been so long.
- You're so pretty.
- Thanks. That's sweet.
What do you do?
I'm doing a dental prosthesis course.
And well... that's it, basically.
That's good.
Some of us are gonna make it.
Well, yeah. Like you.
You'll be able to fix Mum's teeth.
You little bugger.
Hey, give me your glass.
Sure you want to?
- Go on.
- You're sure?
You won't be a young girl anymore.
- That what you want?
- Come on!
- Sleep well.
- Ok. Thanks.
See you tomorrow.
It's going to be a long day.
Take care!
Take care.
Ok, what's wrong?
Well...
you know that...
you're really like me
and we tell each other a lot.
I can't talk to the others
the way I do to you.
I don't know how to explain.
What's wrong?
I've got doubts
about my marriage.
What do you mean
you've got doubts?
You're scared?
That's normal.
I'm panicking about it.
That's normal.
Your Wedding's tomorrow.
Same for everyone!
But...
Be a bit clearer.
I don't understand.
Have you changed your mind?
No, it isn't that.
I just wanted to tell you...
I'm not madly in love.
When you love someone,
you want to be in their arms.
All the time.
All the time.
Do you see what I mean?
You want do everything with them.
You don't think about anything else.
You feel young and beautiful.
It's a fabulous feeling.
And it isn't like that with Michel.
You're talking about love
as if you were 14.
You have to make comprises too.
When you're in love,
you don't need to.
You do realize
the Wedding's tomorrow?
Everyone is here.
What are you trying to say?
I don't know.
He's crazy about you.
It's obvious.
Honestly,
try to preserve that.
Be careful.
Don't spoil everything.
You've taken control
of your life again,
you're much...
you want to...
be a bit more serious, basically.
You know what I thought?
Well, it crossed my mind.
I thought I would like it
if you took me to Paris with you.
Maybe I'd meet other people.
I'd be with you.
I'd be near you.
I don't want to bother you,
but maybe I'd find a job.
Stop this.
Mum,
honestly,
what do you know about Paris?
It's a beautiful city.
It isn't a place for you.
In Paris, if you're broke,
you can't do anything.
You'll be happy with him.
I know you're right.
You came for my wedding.
Don't worry.
- I think you're scared.
- Yes. I know that...
You know, Sam,
it's just something
that crossed my mind,
but it doesn't matter.
I dreamed a bit, that's all.
It's what I wanted.
Angelique, come on!
Come and join us.
Sit down
and have a drink with us.
Hey, it's your fault!
It's the emotion.
Honestly, it's...
2 - nil.
No, no, no.
He was so moved...
See how happy he is.
- Look at mine.
- Got any scissors?
Sam, do you have
another pair of scissors?
Isn't he smart!
You're just witnesses!
Hey!
The groom's riding in here.
- Handsome!
- Thanks, kids.
- Who is it?
- Us.
Just a minute.
- What's she up to?
- I don't know.
At last!
Well?
Hang on, I'll do her hair.
- Can you plug it in?
- Ok. Thanks.
Angelique and Michel,
by deciding to get married,
you promise to love
and respect one another.
Please hold hands now
and exchange your marriage vows.
I, Michel Heinrich,
take you, Angelique Litzengurger,
to be my wife,
to have and to hold
in sickness and in health,
for better, for worse,
to love and to cherish,
till death do us part.
Angelique, take this ring
as a sign of my love
and my faithfulness.
Michel, take this ring,
sign of my love
and my faithfulness.
May God bless your marriage,
he who is the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.
- And be happy!
- Thank you.
Long live the bride and groom!
The bride! The bride!
I'm completely stuck.
I can't do a thing!
Angelique! Michel! Angelique!
Angelique!
Long live the bride and groom!
Thank you for being here.
I'll pass the mike
to the bride.
Thank you.
I'm so happy to see you all,
my family, my friends,
and above all my children.
It's very important for me.
Especially my children.
My four children.
In fairytales, they say,
"They got married
and had lots of children."
Luckily, at your age,
that's not possible anymore!
Seriously though,
I hope you'll be very happy,
that you'll be able
to rely on each other,
and you'll love one another
because life's sad
when you're alone, believe me!
Right. You're stubborn, so am I.
We're too alike.
You know that.
I'm proud when people say
that I'm like you.
It's really flattering.
I wish you both
a long and happy life.
- No. Not me.
- Come on!
Mario!
Mario! Mario!
Mum,
even though I seem distant
and I rarely express my feelings,
I wanted to say
I can see the effort you're making.
I'm proud of you.
I don't really know what to say!
- That you love her!
- I love you.
Right,
Mum,
what I want to say is that...
despite...
the time that's passed between...
between...
us,
I wanted you to know...
that despite everything,
there wasn't a minute
when I didn't think of you.
I have always...
I've always felt
a lot of love for you,
for you all.
And...
it isn't because I was lucky enough
to have a second family
that I forgot my first,
the family I cherish so.
I can honestly say
I love you all
and I always will.
You're my blood brothers
and sister for life.
I love you, Mum.
I love you.
I love you.
- Let's go.
- We're going home.
See you soon!
Cynthia...
Thank you.
Come on.
Ciao.
Lie down.
You mustn't be scared.
I'm not a brute, you know.
Every time I stroke you
or kiss you,
you reject me.
Why?
Are you uncomfortable?
At least answer me.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Aren't you attracted to me?
I'm not in love with you.
What did you just say?
I'm not sure I heard right.
Can you repeat
what you just said?
You're not how I imagined.
I thought it would work,
but it isn't working.
You can't be serious.
You can't be serious.
Don't take me for a fool!
Do you realize
what you're doing?
All you know how to do
is make people suffer!
You can't do that to people!
Did I deserve this?
You really need help, you do!
You bloody bitch!
You're a disgrace!
