Tell me what's happenin'.
Come on!
- Hurricane done killed 'em!
- Clear... Clear the... Clear the tier!
Get outta here! Everybody!
They wanna toss my cell, Jimmy.
They're gonna find my manuscript.
That book is the only thing
I got left in here.
You understand me? That's the only
chance I got to get out of here.
I lose that, they gonna lose too.
Rubin, who do you think the first man
through this door has gotta be now?
It's me.
- Listen...
- All right. Tell 'em to come on in here.
- And line 'em up. - What if...
- Line 'em up, Jimmy.
Rubin, listen to me now.
What if that manuscript...
wasn't in this cell
when we tossed it?
What if it was stuffed
down your pants or something...
stuffed in your crotch,
and we couldn't see it?
I can make sure
you weren't strip-searched, okay?
Don't bullshit me.
No bullshit.
You have my word.
Ain't nobody putting
their hands on me, Jimmy.
Ain't nobody gonna touch me.
All right.
Nobody touches you.
You think I killed them people?
I don't know, Rubin.
I don't know.
Shit. Motherfuckers.
<i>1- 10. Suspect at 1059...</i>
- John, you been drinkin'?
- No. No.
All right. All right.
Just relax. Let me handle this.
Okay.
- Licence and registration.
- It's on the steering post.
What's goin' on?
Aw, shit, Hurricane.
Didn't realize it was you.
Yeah, it's me.
What's goin' on, Theo?
We're lookin' for two negroes
in a white car.
- Any two will do?
- No...
Oh, sh...
Okay, get out.
All right. Let's go.
Come on.
- Check his vitals.
- It's clear.
- Air passage.
- Heart rate has changed.
Keep the chin up.
Keep the passage open.
Can he talk, Doc?
- Just for a moment.
- Would you raise his head?
Can you make out these two men?
Are these the two men who shot you?
Look carefully, sir.
Are these the two men who did it?
- He said no.
- Move closer.
- He said no.
- Move closer!
Take another look, sir.
Son of a bitch.
Sir, look closer.
You sure these aren't the men?
- Dirty son of a bitch.
- Watch your mouth!
- Same old shit, huh, Della Pesca?
- Shut up!
Ask him again.
You been after me
my whole life, Della Pesca.
Now you're trying to pin
a murder jacket on me, huh?
Well, I got news for you.
It don't fit.
I'm gonna take your black ass down...
Mr Fuckin' Champion of the World.
I got your black fuckin' champion
right between my legs...
you short punk bitch.
You try me.
That's just what I'm gonna do.

Hey, man, it's cold out here.
What are you talkin' about?
It's like summer for us.
Yeah, well, I like the summers
in Brooklyn better.
Is all these people out here
freezing their butts off to buy books?
- That's right.
- Lined up like this...
not for a movie
or a ball game or somethin'?
- Ain't it great?
- No, "isn't it." "Isn't it great?"
Very good.
I stand corrected, Les.
Used books,
books nobody wants any more.
Aw, that's the great thing
about books, you know.
Once you use 'em, you can pass 'em
along to somebody else like a torch...
or a football,
you know, something you pass.
Okay, bring it on in.
Put it down.
Good, good. Down.
Okay, young man,
that'll be 25 cents.
- Jesus.
- Twenty-five cent?
Mustn't be much of a book.
<i>- Ah, listen, everybody
- Everybody</i>
<i>Especially you, girl</i>
So, Lesra, what'd you get?
Uh, this.
- What is it?
- I don't know. It's about a boxer.
It's got like 337 pages,
though, you know.
Well, it probably takes a lot of words
to tell someone's life story, eh?
- Don't you think?
- Yeah, well, this guy must be...
like 150 years old, you know,
if he gon' use all these words.
You know what, Les? Sometimes
we don't pick the books we read.
<i>- They pick us.
- Somebody, somewhere</i>
<i>- I tell you, it's unfair
- Can I get some whisky</i>
<i>Can I get some whisky
Yeah</i>
Mr Broden, we've been home schooling
this young man for eight months.
That's how it applies to us.
No, I'm not married.
Mr Swinton, who you spoke with...
is one of the two men I live with.
No, Sam Chaiton is
the other man I live with.
No, I don't think you do see,
Mr Broden.
They are my business partners
and my roommates.
And you're the Department
of Education...
and you're telling me you're prepared
to stop this young man's education...
because you can't find
some goddam high school records?
Yep, that's exactly
what I'm doing, Mr Broden.
No, no, I'm not asking you
to make an exception.
I'm asking you to do your job,
which is qualitatively different...
but I thank you for it anyway.
- Shit.
- Political Science 101, the art of gentle persuasion.
Never mind 101.
I need a smoke.
- So how was the book sale?
- Great.
<i>- There.
- Did you get The Other America?</i>
<i>Uh, I couldn't find The Other
America, but I got you, uh...</i>
Sam Robertson Davies, R.D. Laing.
- You don't want to piss me off today.
- It's a book sale, Lisa, not a library.
- Whatever.
- Hey, look, Lisa.
<i>Got this one right here for 25 cent.
The Sixteenth Round.</i>
- Oh, your first book, huh?
- Yeah.
"Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."
Hurricane is the professional name
that I acquired later on in life.
Carter is the slave name
that was given to my forefathers...
who worked in the cotton fields
of Alabama and, and Georgia...
and was passed on to me.
The kindest thing I can say
about my childhood...
is that I survived it.
Paterson was a run-down town,
a poor and violent place.
The only way to survive
was to know how to handle yourself...
and I learned fast.
Come on! Hurry up!
- Let's get out of here!
- Come on! Let's go! Hurry up! Let's get out of here!
Take this out.
Hey, Donnique, go for a swim!
Hello, boys.
Wanna see something?
Huh? Isn't that pretty?
You like that?
- What's your name?
- Donnique.
Donnique?
That's a pretty name, Donnique.
You wanna be good to me, sugar?
H-H-Hey, mister!
Leave him alone!
I wouldn't hurt your friend.
Would I?
You don't need
to be afraid, Donnique.
You're pretty.
How old are you?
- Ten.
- Ten?
I said, leave him alone!
Run! Run! Come on!
- Get outta here!
- Run!
You little bastard.
Let's get outta here!
You black bastard, you!
Goddam it!
Please, mister! Put me down!
- Shut up, you son of a bitch!
- Put me down!
Hey!
- I didn't... didn't do nothin'!
- Come on! Let's go!
- I didn't... I didn't...
- Shut up.
I didn't do nothin'.
- Come on, you...
- No!
- Get in there.
- I-It wasn't me.
I... I... didn't do nothin'!
Sit down, kid.
What have we got here?
It's a juvenile case.
He's a kid, Sarge.
He's only 11 years old.
It's a nigger with a knife.
I don't care how old he is.
Take care of him.
We know you were at the falls last week,
and we know what happened.
So you're gonna talk,
you little son of a bitch.
You'll be makin' speeches
when I get through with your black ass.
Ralph. Ralph.
I'm Sergeant Detective Della Pesca.
You wanna tell me what happened?
What is it, you were trying to rob
this man's gold watch...
and he fought back,
and so you stabbed him?
Is that pretty much it?
I-I... didn't do nothin'.
Let me tell you something, sunshine.
The man you stabbed...
is a very important member
of this community...
and you are goin' down.
Do you see?
And I am going to see to it personally.
As for you, Rubin Carter,
you're a menace to society.
If something isn't done
about you soon...
you'll become a dangerous man
in later life.
I only wish you were old enough
I could send you to state prison.
I therefore sentence you...
to the state home for boys
in Jamesburg...
from this day till you're
21 years of age.
- So be it.
- It's okay, son.
Jamesburg was a place of horror
that I would be forever sorry...
to have known existed.
It was there that I spent the next
eight years learning how to maim...
butcher and fight for my survival.
I don't get what's goin' on here.
I'm the boy's father.
I take care of him.
I don't know what you people...
I mean, what's it to you?
M-Mr Martin, we've gotten to know
Lesra over the past few weeks.
And I gotta tell you, he's got
more natural ability and enthusiasm...
than just about any kid
I've ever worked with.
So, when he told us
he wanted to go to college...
we just figured
that's the way it was gonna be.
Well, I know he's smart.
There's no doubt about that,
but, uh...
he can't read, Mrs Martin.
But we think that we could teach him.
I mean, within...
probably two years, with a lot of work,
we could get him ready for college.
- Yeah, well, that school sure not doin' it.
- Now wait just a second.
- I am that boy's father...
- But if they can give him more...
They're talkin' to me, Alma!
Uh, Mr Martin, you know,
we got plenty of room.
And if Lesra wants to learn,
then we can teach him.
If you don't want that, that's fine.
That's up to you.
But no one here is trying
to replace you, sir.
- This what you want, boy?
- I wanna go to college.
And if that's what it's gonna take,
then, yeah.
It don't seem right.
Why you gotta go, Lesra?
- Don't you want me to go, El?
- You should be here backin' me up.
Leave the boy, Elston.
Lesra goin' to Toronto now.
Got a job to do.
Wants to go to college.
After eight years at Jamesburg,
I escaped.
I was angry,
embittered with life.
I ran as if on a cloud...
unaware of how high I was stepping
or of anything else around me.
There was room in my head
for only one word...
one thought:
freedom.
I ran straight into the U.S. Army
and a pair of paratrooper wings...
and my whole life changed.
I learned that
knowledge of self and kind...
is the only true means
to the liberation of the black man.
I could do anything.
I overcame my stutter.
I became a prizefighter.
I came back to Paterson...
the all-Army European
welterweight champ.
Let me have a soda, please.
Judy, who's that fine soldier
standing over there at the bar?
Oh, he's a local boy.
Rubin Carter, I think.
Make it two.
- He's comin' over here.
- Uh-oh. Stay cool.
I'm back. I'm back.
- Mmm, so you missed me, did you?
- So tell me...
- Well, what do you want to know?
- You're in my seat.
Uh, you know, I'm from Georgia.
And I was thinkin'
that afterwards you and me...
You're in my seat, country.
I don't see your name anywhere.
That's 'cause you're blinded by
the ass-kickin' I'm about to put on you.
Now get up out of my seat.
- Hey, come on now. Take it easy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Let that motherfucker go. - Just stop it. Listen.
- Not here. - You know what? I wanna dance.
You wanna come over here and dance with me?
- Not here.
- Hey, I'm talkin' to you. - Hmm?
Oh, you wanna fight,
or you wanna dance?
- He ain't worth it.
- Yeah, you wanna dance. Come on.
<i>- Brother got a lot of hostility up in him.
- Should I let myself go</i>
<i>In his direction</i>
<i>- Come on, sweet thing. Let's dance.
- Is his love strong enough</i>
<i>For my heart's protection</i>
<i>- I don't know
- I don't know, I don't know</i>
<i>- I don't know
- I don't know, I don't know</i>
<i>- You dance nice.
- But he loves me so good</i>
<i>- Till I think I should
- Thank you.</i>
<i>If I gave him my heart</i>
<i>- These hands were meant for more than just fighting.
- Would he refuse it</i>
<i>Would he tear it apart</i>
<i>- Or tenderly use it
- Her name was Mae Thelma.</i>
<i>- I don't know
- And she was the prettiest woman I had ever seen.</i>
<i>- I don't know
- I don't know, I don't know</i>
<i>But he hugs me so tight</i>
<i>Till I think I might</i>
You got a girl around?
No. I ain't got no girl.
No?
Well, I had a good time
with you tonight.
- Mae Thelma, is that you?
- Yeah. Mama, I'll be right up.
- You gon' call me tomorrow?
- I'm gon' call you tonight.
- No, you can't call me tonight now.
- I'll call you tomorrow then.
You'll call me tomorr...
- Is that your father?
- No. My father's asleep.
- Your name Rubin Carter?
- Yeah.
- You're comin' with us.
- For what?
You heard the man.
What'd you think,
we weren't gonna find you?
You still owe me time.
<i>104, meet Vice officers
at Glory Park.</i>
All right. Get out.
- This way now.
- Okay.
From that moment on...
I decided to take control
of my life.
I made up my mind
to turn my body into a weapon.
I would be a warrior-scholar.
I boxed. I went to school.
I began reading
W.E. B DuBois, Richard Wright.
Move, tier one! Move it!
So I gave up
all the worthless luxuries...
that most inmates crave...
the girlie books, fags,
cigarettes, the movies.
I hated them.
In fact, I hated everyone.
I didn't even speak English.
I spoke hate,
and its verbs were fists.
I made up my mind
to turn my body...
into a weapon that would
eventually set me free...
or kill anyone who sought
to keep me in prison.
On September 21, 1961...
I was released,
and I vowed upon everything holy...
never to come back to prison again.
I had spent almost half my time
on this Earth...
in jail.
Hey, come on, Lesra.
Time to get up. Breakfast, buddy.
Yeah. Yeah, all right.
Yeah, I'm up. I'm up.
Did you get any sleep?
Your light's been on all night.
I just can't stop reading, man.
This book's about my life.
Jeez, Lisa, you gotta smoke
for breakfast?
- Do you know when we met in Brooklyn?
- Yeah.
Why'd you take me home?
Well, you know, you...
you met my folks, man...
and you brought me up here,
you did all this stuff for me.
Yeah.
No, I mean, why?
Why'd you do all that?
'Cause you were smart and funny.
And short. You know, we figured
it'd be good for you to...
spend a little time
with some tall white people.
- Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah.
- What, did you do it 'cause I'm black?
And you thought
I couldn't do it myself?
'Cause Rubin... Rubin did it
all himself, you know.
Hey, Les, we didn't feel
sorry for you.
We met you and got to know you and realized
you could accomplish some things...
and, like a lot of us,
you could use some help.
I'm sure that Hurricane Carter
had some help along the way.
- None of us does it alone.
- Hey.
As far as doin' it for yourself goes,
nobody can learn anything for you.
Trust me. Everything you're doing now,
you're doing for yourself.
I'll get it.
- You know, I been thinkin'.
- Yeah?
- How're you doing?
- About what?
No, no, no, he's here. He just...
Think I wanna put up a heavy bag.
You know, like a big punching bag.
Uh, those renovations?
Probably the end of the month.
- Oh, any special reason?
- No. No, man.
I just feel like punchin'
something, you know?
That's it. It's set.
- A little low. A little low.
- Keep your hand up. Keep the left down.
Straight out of prison,
I was a fighting machine.
One thing I could do,
and the only thing, was box.
I had tasted my own blood...
and I loved it.
This is your ringside commentator.
Tonight's fight brings together...
Rubin "Hurricane" Carter
from Paterson, New Jersey...
and Joey Cooper,
who is currently undefeated.
Yeah! Way to go, Hurricane!
Hit him!
And the champion, Joey Cooper,
seems to be helpless...
against Rubin Carter,
the challenger.
Yeah!
And I'll tell ya, folks,
things are taking a surprising turn...
in this middleweight fight tonight.
Joey Cooper in big trouble.
Rubin Carter pourin' it on.
Left hook, right hook, uppercut... Oh!
He's down.
Oh, look at this.
What a disaster for Cooper.
Carter is punishing him.
He's gonna... Oh, he is down, folks.
He is down for the count,
and he is not getting up.
- Four, five, six...
- I'll tell you that right now.
- Get up! - seven...
- Get up now!
Right now!
You're out!
Unbelievable! Rubin Carter
comes on like a hurricane...
and defeats
the undefeated Joey Cooper...
in round one of
this middleweight fight.
- I don't believe it! Oh!
- Unbelievable upset tonight.
Have you ever seen anything like it?
- And the crowd is goin' wild here in Reading, Pennsylvania.
- You all right, Cooper?
- And Rubin Carter took this fight right
away from him here this evening. - I'm okay.
Mrs Carter, what do you think it's gonna be
like being married to such a ferocious fighter?
- Well, uh... - Well, it's gonna be a little
scary, but I'll try my best. All right.
Can you believe
that black son of a bitch?
He thinks he's champion of the world.
Fighter of the year, my ass.
A low-life criminal.
<i>My mother told me</i>
<i>'Fore she passed away</i>
<i>Said, son, when I'm gone</i>
<i>Don't forget to pray
'cause there'll be hard times</i>
<i>- What the hell do they expect? Of course a riot broke out.
- Hard times</i>
Every time we try to stand up
and defend our own neighbourhoods...
they send the cops in
to bust us in our heads.
If you feel so strongly about all this,
Hurricane, why aren't you out there...
instead of sittin' in here drinkin'?
I'm drinkin' club soda, first of all, and I'm
in here because you asked me to be here.
But you're right.
Maybe I should go down there.
Yeah, maybe I should go grab my gun,
shoot me a half a dozen...
of them nigger-hatin' cops, huh?
What you think, Bucky? I know I can get
me about five of'em before they get me.
Ed? Huh?
How about you?
You wanna come?
Shit. That's off the record,
by the way.
Oh, he knows that.
Don't you?
Sure, champ. Sure.
You betcha.
- Take that, champ!
- Get down.
- Right here.
- Rubin, what is this?
- Get down, get down! Stay down!
- Oh, Lord, what is... - Let's get outta here!
- You all right, T?
- Shh, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
Shh. It's okay.
All right, all right,
all right, all right, all right.
- You all right?
- You know why they did this.
Shh. All right. Come on,
come on, come on, come on.
- I told you it was off the record.
- Nothin' with you is off the record!
- Look, I don't want to go into it right now.
- You ain't had no business talkin' to them people.
- You know everything that you say...
- All right, all right, all right, all right.
- They gon' make up something different.
- Mae, what you want me to do, huh?
- What you want me to do?
- Why do you say these things?
- I know what they doin'. I know exactly what they doin'.
- Are you trying to get us killed?
So what you want me to do, huh?
You want me to roll over
and just lay dead?
- Pride. It ain't nothin' but pride!
- You're damn right it's pride.
- I'm guilty.
- Give me my baby.
Shit.

Champion of the world!
Yeah, they're still out.
I've seen a lot of things in my time,
but it's taken 35 minutes...
for these judges to tell us
what this home town crowd already knows.
Joey Giardello
is about to the lose the crown...
to Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.
Ladies and gentlemen...
it's a unanimous decision.
The winner
and still champion of the world...
Joey Giardello!
Giardello!
No. No, no. No. No.
Hey. What?
- You've stolen it!
- Aw, shit!
- This is bullshit!
- What's goin' on here?
- Yes, yes!
- Boo!
Well, all I can say
is these Philly judges...
must have been watching
a different fight...
because in the one we just saw,
Hurricane Carter took the title.
<i>Oh, now tell me
where can you party, child</i>
<i>- All night long
- In the basement</i>
<i>Down in the basement, yeah</i>
<i>Oh, where can you go
when your money gets low</i>
<i>In the basement
Whoa, down in the basement</i>
<i>And if a storm is takin'place
you can jam and still be safe</i>
<i>- In the basement, down in the basement
- I got somethin' special for you.</i>
- Hey, Hurricane, how you doin'?
- Hey, champ.
<i>In the basement
Down in the basement</i>
<i>- Oh, you got the comforts of home
- Anybody call a cab?</i>
<i>- A nightclub too
- In the basement</i>
<i>- Oh, down in the basement
- Anybody call a cab?</i>
I did, unless Rubin's
taking me home.
Yeah, if I take you,
it ain't gonna be home.
Mr Carter. M-Mr Carter.
- Headed 'cross town, Mr Carter?
- Yeah. Why? You need a ride?
- Wo... Would you mind?
- No, I wouldn't mind.
- All right! Okay.
- Come on.
- You drive.
- Drive your car?
- Come on.
- Oh, shit!
My friends are never gonna believe
I was cruising with The Hurricane.
- You know, what we wanna know is, can we get his autograph?
- No. No, no.
Oh, shit.
Motherfuckers.
- John, you been drinkin'?
- No. - All right.
All right, just relax.
Let me handle this.
All right.
Licence and registration.
It's okay. I got it.
You guys come with me.
B-E-L-L-O. Bello.
Bradley. B-R-A-D-L-E-Y.
Okay.
Are those the guys?
No?
Okay, let's go.
So what are you doing
around here at that hour?
Well, we was just out, you know,
takin' a walk, right?
- Yeah. Just gettin' a pack of cigarettes. That's it.
- Yeah.
Both of you are in big trouble.
You're in violation
of your parole.
But I don't wanna talk
about the burglary.
We'll talk about
your parole problem later, Bello.
As far as I'm concerned...
no proof a burglary
really took place.
See what I mean?
Yeah, I see what you mean.
I'm only interested
in the facts in this case...
and you and Bradley here are the only
two people that can really help me out.
Do you follow?
- Yeah, I follow.
- Good.
Now, is there any scenario
that you can imagine...
in which you could be sure...
really, positively sure...
that the man you saw that night...
was Rubin Carter?
Yeah, Rubin Carter. Yeah.
Wanna tell me again what happened?
You were there having a drink? What was that?
No, no, it was, uh...
- I was goin' out for a pack of cigarettes.
- Yeah.
I heard a couple of shots, then I saw these
two coloured guys, they come out of the bar.
And one of them was?
- One of them was Rubin Carter.
- Rubin Carter?
- Right, Rubin Carter, the fighter.
- Yeah, sure.
All rise.
The court will come to order.
The Honourable Judge Larner presiding.
Be seated.
The defendants will rise.
Rubin Carter...
although you still contend you are not
guilty of the crimes charged against you...
you were afforded a full and fair trial
by a jury of your peers.
Have you reached a verdict?
Yes, we have, Your Honour.
We, the jury, find the defendants,
Rubin Carter...
and John Artis,
guilty on all counts.
Oh, no!
- No!
- That ain't right! He's innocent!
- Order.
- No!
- Order in the court.
- No!
- Order! Bailiff will see to it that order prevails.
- No! No!
This ain't right. Railroaded!
- No.
- Rubin Carter...
John Artis...
for the murder of James Oliver,
it is the court's sentence...
that you be imprisoned
for the remainder of your natural life.
No!
On the second count,
the murder of Fred Nauyaks...
you are sentenced to be imprisoned
for the remainder of your natural life.
No, God, no!
As to the third count involving
the murder of Hazel Tanis...
it is the sentence of this court
that you be imprisoned...
for the remainder
of your natural life.
Okay, Carter, let's go.
Take it easy.
You're a tough guy.
He thinks he's gonna stay in a room,
and that's it.
Put your clothes, your shoes, your ring, your
watch and whatever else you've got in that bag.
You are being issued a standard inmate
uniform with your number sewn on it...
so that we can identify you
immediately.
And you'll go to have your facial hair
shaved. You know the rules.
No, I can't do it, Warden.
I beg your pardon?
I cannot do it.
Look, you have legal custody
over my body...
but I'm innocent.
I've committed no crime.
The crime's been committed against me.
And I will not wear the clothes
of a guilty man.
Now, I'll go anywhere you want me to go
in this penitentiary, Warden...
but you let it be known
in no uncertain terms...
that any man who tries
to put his hands on me...
This place is where we
tell you the rules.
You hear that?
Do you understand me?
Do you?
Because if you do,
you had better strip right now...
and put on that fucking uniform.
I can't do that.
Put this man in the hole.
Give him sufficient time
to reflect...
on how he intends to behave
in this institution.
Ninety days.
Hey, Bobby,
we've got another one for ya.
I like your suit.
Three, two...
one.
Lights-out.
You see?
"Though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil."
There's doubt.
The shadow is doubt.
The shadow is doubt.
But you're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me.
Lights-out.
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?
You can't break me
'cause you didn't make me.
You understand? Huh?
You fucked everything up for everybody,
Rubin. It's all fucked-up.
Who's that?
Y'all ain't got no speakers in here.
Who is that?
I put us into this situation
any goddam way...
motherfucker.
I done fucked everything up for everybody.
You know, that shit that's all fucked up.
What the fuck they expect us
to do now, huh? Motherfucker.
I'm s... I'm s... I'm scared.
Just shut up. Shut the fuck up,
you little skinny motherfucker.
You think your father used to beat
your little stuttering ass?
Don't make me
jump over there on ya.
No, you shut up.
Just shut the fuck up, talkin' to me.
Fuck you talkin' to? You ain't...
You ain't telling me what to say.
I'm running shit around here.
Fuck is wrong?
Ain't nobody runnin' shit.
I'm runnin' shit.
Shut the fuck up!
What you say?
No. No.
What are we gonna do now?
Huh?
I don't know what.
Shit, ain't nobody touchin' me.
No goddam soul touchin' me.
Put your hands on me not twice. You
better not put your fuckin' hands on me.
- I got...
- Shut up!
Oh, yeah. There's our man.
I can feel the hate. Can you feel it?
You can feel the hate, Rubin.
Don't you wanna just hurt somebody?
I feel like
I wanna kill somebody...
'cept there ain't nobody
in here to kill.
'Cept you, boy.
How 'bout it, Rube?
Get away from me!
All right, Carter. Time's up.
Jesus Christ.
You could really use a shower.
You smell awful, Mr Carter.
Why don't you take a shower?
Get you a decent cell
with a bed and some food.
- You'll feel a lot better.
- At what price do I, uh...
take this shower?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what do I put on...
after I take this shower
that's gonna make me feel so good?
What everyone else puts on.
That's the rules.
Yeah, well, you can just take me
on back down to the hole.
You could die down there.
I could die up here too.
Look, what if I got you a pair
of pyjamas from the prison hospital?
As far as I'm concerned,
you'd be wearing prison-issued clothing.
They got stripes?
- No stripes.
- What 'bout numbers?
- No numbers.
- What colour are they?
They're white.
Okay, I can live with those.
- Thank you, Mr Carter.
- You're welcome, Mr Williams.
Shower's all yours.
Thank you.
It came to me as kind of a revelation
that my own freedom...
lay in not wanting or needing anything
of which they could deprive me.
If punishment consisted
of being locked in your cell...
then by simply choosing
to never leave my cell...
I deprived them of that weapon.
I would not work in their shops.
I would not eat their food.
I began to study. I dissected
my entire case piece by piece...
beginning with my initial arrest
through the trial itself...
and finally to the awful verdict.
I didn't get a trial free from
constitutional error and racial prejudice.
He knows that. You know it.
That's not helpin' me
in here, Myron.
Look. Look, I'm innocent,
that's why.
Seven years! You're goddam right
it's seven years!
Just get me outta here.
I want a new trial. Okay?
The people united
will never be defeated.
The people united
will never be defeated.
The people united
will never be defeated.
The people united...
It shows that there's still hope.
There is hope for change
in America.
I believe in law and order,
and I believe that everybody...
has a right to,
uh, get another trial.
<i>Here comes the story
of The Hurricane</i>
<i>The man the authorities
came to blame</i>
<i>- For something that he never done
- Give a hand for Miss Ellen Burstyn.</i>
<i>Put in a prison cell
but one time</i>
<i>He could have been
the champion of the world</i>
They ain't givin' up. They said
they're gonna demonstrate again.
Muhammad Ali and... and Ellen Burstyn.
Bob Dylan.
- Everybody.
- That's good, Mae.
Everybody.
Look, Mae, uh...
we've already lost two trials, and now they've
turned down my request for an appeal.
I'm sorry. It, uh... It's over.
It's finished.
I'm gonna die in here,
Mae, so...
- Baby, listen, there is still a chance.
- Listen to me now.
- Now, all we have to do is hang on.
- There's nothin' to hang on to.
I want you to divorce me,
understand?
And I don't want you
to come back down here.
- No. No, now you listen to me.
- Mae, don't make... don't make this...
There... There are still things
that we can do.
- We just gotta get you out of here.
- I am not gonna be a weight hanging around your neck.
- You are no weight around my neck!
- Well, then you're a weight around mine.
Now, I can't do all the years
I gotta do in here...
knowin' that they can take your beautiful
face away from me anytime they want to.
- You understand?
- Rubin.
I ain't walkin' away from you.
I'm dead.
- Rubin.
- Just bury me, please.
Rubin?
Rubin.
Rubin, we're... we're in this together
now. We just gotta hang on.
Guard.
Rubin.
Rubin?
We just gotta hang on.
We just gotta hang on.
I will bend time to my own clock.
When the prisoners awake,
I will sleep.
When they sleep, I will wake.
I will live neither in their cell...
nor in my own heart...
only in my mind...
and my spirit.
"Once I reached my hand out for help."
It came down and then withered...
as dry grass blown away into dust
leaving nothin'.
Now I wait for nothin'.
I need nothin'.
Not tomorrow, not freedom,
not justice.
In the end,
the prison will vanish...
and there'll be no more Rubin...
no more Carter...
only The Hurricane.
And after him...
"there is no more."
Man, what are we gonna do?
- About what?
- About The Hurricane, that's what.
Well, there's not much
we can do, Lesra.
B-But the man's innocent, yet he's been
in jail 15, 16 years. That's not right.
- I know that's what his book says.
- Uh, two juries found him guilty, Les.
- Yeah, two white juries.
- Hey, hey, not all white people are racists.
Not all black people are murderers.
Look, I just... I just want
to write him a letter...
and tell him how much his book
meant to me, that's all.
<i>I know you told me</i>
<i>- Such a long time ago
- Dear...</i>
<i>- Mr Hurricane.
- That you want me</i>
<i>- You don't love me no more
- No, that's really stupid.</i>
<i>- I wanna know
- What's that?</i>
<i>- It's ten dollars, U.S.
- Oh, what you mean to me</i>
<i>- I thought he might need some money for stamps...
- Believe me, darlin'</i>
if you want him
to write you back.
<i>Oh-oh, no</i>
Yeah. Yeah, write me back.
<i>- That's cool. Thanks, Lisa.
- I know you told me</i>
No problem.
<i>- Dear Mr Rubin Carter.
- And I know</i>
I read your book...
and I really felt sad
about what happened to you.
I want you to know
how much your book meant to me.
<i>Little baby, child
move you</i>
<i>Whoa-whoa-whoa</i>
<i>Please</i>
It's here! Hey, he wrote us back!
It's here!
It's here! He wrote us back!
Home of the brave!
Land of the free!
He wrote us back!
- Can you stand it?
- Well, open it already.
I don't know.
You think I should?
"Dear Lesra..."
please forgive
the seemingly tardy reply...
but he who bemoans
the lack of opportunity...
forgets that small doors
many times open up into large rooms.
It was not only thoughtful,
but insightful on your part.
Stamps, paper and envelopes...
were exactly what was needed
to complete this transmission.
Your letter, feelings,
concerns, desires and warmth...
literally
jumped off the page at me...
when reading
your heartfelt message.
It is as if you heard
my thoughts...
and reached out
to share yours with me...
at a moment when I can hear you.
So thank you once again.
Forever...
your friend and brother...
"Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."
Wow.
You got your answer.
Yeah.
Dear Rubin...
I've been thinking about my life
compared to yours.
I come from Bushwick in Brooklyn.
My parents are alcoholics
and my brother's in prison.
I was third in my class,
and I couldn't even read.
I couldn't write you this letter
just a year ago...
but then I met these friends from Canada
when I had a summer job at the EPA.
They offered to educate me
and they got me out.
Sometimes I feel guilty about my family
'cause I left 'em behind.
Now that I know you,
I know it isn't right.
I shouldn't cry
about my own feelings...
not if you can do what you've done.
I've been thinkin' though.
I would like to come and visit you,
if that will be all right.
Palm down, right hand.
Keep the line moving.
- Put your right hand out, please. Palm down.
- Keep the line moving.
- Keep the line moving, please.
- Come on. Come on.
Okay, now.
Y'all listen up now. Visits for Jones,
Taylor, Harris, Ramos...
Sykes, Carter, Tucei,
line up right here.
Uh, you didn't call my boy's name.
Hemmings. Eric Hemmings, 65660.
- Hemmings?
- Yeah.
Uh-uh, no visit for Hemmings today.
He's in lockup.
- Okay, Mac, open it up.
- Keep out of the way.
Extend your arms. Palms.
Turn around.
Show me your feet.
Okay, spread 'em.
Next.
Open your mouth.
Roll your tongue.
Extend your arms.
Show me your palms.
Turn around.
Show me your feet.
Spread 'em.
Ready on the outside!
Okay, come on.
Single file, y'all.
Let's go. Single file.
Hey, sweetheart!
Single file.
Let's go. Single file.
You look nice.
Mr Carter?
- Rubin "Hurricane" Carter. Is that you?
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm sorry, you don't look like your pictures. I thought you'd be bigger.
- Hey, I'm bigger than you.
- But don't tell anybody, okay?
- All... All right.
Okay. Sit down.
- Hey, this is some place, man.
- No.
No, it's not. This is no place,
not for a human being.
Don't ever get used to
a place like this, Lesra.
You got a lot of guts, kid.
Takes a lot of courage to come
all the way down here by yourself.
I'm impressed.
- I was scared you weren't gonna let me come.
- Me too.
But you're Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.
What would you be scared of?
Well, doors opening,
of the light outside...
of you.
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
- Mr Carter, I don't understand.
- Oh, no, no, no, don't call me Mr Carter.
- Call me Rube.
- Rube?
Yeah. Rube.
All right. Rube.
So, tell me about these folks
you're livin' with.
- Oh, the Canadians. - Yes.
- Yeah, I got pictures of'em.
Here.
This is Sam, this is Terry,
and this is Lisa.
- They're the greatest, man.
- Huh.
Yeah, I met 'em at an EPA in Brooklyn,
and, you know, they was doin' business.
They brought me home and stuff,
and the rest is what happened, man.
Yeah, that's when
my life changed, Rube.
Just yanked a brother up and took him
up to Canada, just like that?
No, no, they asked my folks.
I see. So what do they do?
Are they a religious group...
or, uh, hippies or a commune or...
No, they fix up houses and sell 'em.
You know?
- They're just people.
- Just people.
Just workin', eatin',
livin' together?
I don't know. This is what they do, man.
That's their thing.
- What'd your folks say?
- Oh, well, my dad, you know, he's happy.
- He's glad for me.
- Oh, good.
You see 'em much,
your people, your folks?
Yeah, but sometimes
it's hard though.
Yeah, well...
Yeah, it's hard.
You give them hope.
- Yeah, I guess.
- You do. You give 'em hope.
Because you have transcended, Lesra.
It is very important to transcend
the places that hold us.
You know that? You've learned to read.
You've learned to write.
Writing is... it's magic.
You feel that sometimes?
- Yeah, I guess I do.
- Mm-hmm.
When I started writing...
I discovered that I was doing more
than just telling a story.
See, writing is a weapon...
and it's more powerful
than a fist can ever be.
Every time I sat down to write, I could
rise above the walls of this prison.
I could look out over the walls
all across the state of New Jersey.
And I could see Nelson Mandela
in his cell writing his book.
I could see Huey.
I could see Dostoyevsky.
I could see Victor Hugo, Emile Zola,
and... and they would say to me...
"Rubin, what you doin' in there?"
And I say,
"Hey, I know all you guys."
It's magic, Lesra.
Mmm, they sure don't teach it
that way up in Canada.
- Maybe you could tell me some books to read.
- I can do that.
But these people in Canada or anywhere
else, they can only teach you so much.
It's up to you. It's your search. You
gotta find out what's true for you...
what is true for Lesra Martin.
I never met nobody like you before.
You think I killed
those people, son?
- No, I know you didn't.
- How you know?
I just know.
I'm so glad I met you, Lesra.
Me too.
Visit's up.
Everybody out.
Come on, folks. Let's go.
You like a quick picture
of you and your son, Mr Carter?
- Come on, folks. Let's go.
- It's up to my son.
Yeah, all right. All right.
That's enough pictures.
Come on. Let's go.
Dear Lesra...
whoever is responsible for your present
condition obviously cares a great deal.
For me, it was a miracle to see
such light in a human being again.
When you came, it was like the day
had started off without the sun.
It's dim and it's cool.
Then suddenly,
and without any warning...
the sunshine breaks through the dimness
and lights up everything.
<i>What ya gonna do
Do you wanna get down</i>
<i>What ya gonna do
Do you wanna get down</i>
You been all around the world,
huh, Mobutu?
- Been everywhere.
- Shut your motherfuckin' mouth up!
<i>Get down on it
Get down on it</i>
<i>- Come on and get down on it
- Where your people from, Africa?</i>
Born in the Congo. Mm-hmm.
In the blackness of black.
My mother was a Pygmy.
She stood four foot, one inch.
- Hmm.
- My father was a big Watusi.
He was seven foot, ten.
He'd have to pick her up
like a little child to kiss her.
<i>- Hmm, cute.
- Get down on it</i>
<i>Come on now
Get down on it</i>
<i>If you really want it
get down on it</i>
What do you think of white folks?
They're just a little bit too much
of this stuff, you know?
But, uh, then again...
I once rode the rails
with a hobo by the name of, um...
Alabama.
Now, he was white folks...
and he was a good man.
Mm-hmm. He saved my life
three times.
- Three times?
- Mm-hmm. Three times.
Three times life, huh?
Everything I lost...
that really matters
I lost at the hand of white folks.
I know what you mean...
but they ain't all bad.
<i>What ya wanna do
Do you wanna get down</i>
<i>- What ya gonna do
- But they sure can't dance.</i>
Oh, shit.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, y'all,
th-this is where we go in.
Come on.
Come on!
- Don't look now, but we're being watched.
- Stop it.
Somehow I don't think
you can smoke in there.
Right over there.
Hey, Rube, man, we made it.
How you doin', man?
All right.
- Sam.
- Hey, Rubin. Good to meet you.
Yeah. Good, good, good.
- Professor.
- Yeah.
- This is Terry.
- Terry.
- Nice to meet you.
- It's my pleasure, Terry. Heard a lot about you.
- Lisa.
- Lisa.
So, you don't look like
I thought you would look.
Lesra said you were so tough.
- Is that good?
- Don't know. Don't know.
Don't know. Come on.
Sit down.
Everybody together!
I can't stand it.
So, uh, Rubin,
how's the appeal goin'?
Uh, we hear it's with the New Jersey
Supreme Court. Have they set a date?
Why don't we talk about Lesra?
I'm sure that Lesra wants to know
what's happening with your case too.
My case is doing what it's doing.
I have to focus on the fact
that I have to do the time.
Well, how do you do that?
How do I do that? I do that by not
allowing myself to want or to need...
anything.
I'm free in here because
there's nothing I want out here.
Not free to want?
Not free to risk human contact?
This place doesn't allow you
to be human.
The only contact you get in here is gettin'
stabbed in the back or gang-raped in the shower.
That's what they've reduced you to. I mean, you've
obviously elevated it to something else with Lesra.
Yeah, because of you, Rube,
I wanna be a lawyer when I grow up...
and prove you innocent.
Except we don't have to wait till I'm a lawyer,
Rube, because these guys want to help, man.
- We all believe in your innocence.
- I've been innocent for 16 years.
That's how long I've been in here.
Innocence is a highly overrated commodity.
None of us can judge what you've been
through, but you might wanna consider...
You're damn right none of you can judge
what I've been through...
because none of you
have been through it.
What do you know about doing time?
Tell me about it.
What do you know about what it is to be me? What do you...
What do you know about being in this place?
- Hey, this is too much, you guys.
- Yeah, you're right. This is too much.
Um, y'all, look,
let's just go, all right?
- Rubin. Rubin. Rubin.
- Right there.
Hey, listen, we left a package
for you in the mail room.
Yes.
Visitors left this for you
in the mail room.
We had to open it
'cause of security.
Nice to have friends.
"Special gift for The Hurricane."
Don't trust 'em, Rubin.
Don't trust 'em.
You trust a bunch of little white-ass
do-gooders more than you trust me...
more than you trust us.
Yeah. No more hate.
Try that on, huh?
Don't trust 'em, Rubin.
They'll turn on ya. Don't trust 'em, no.
- Think me and you. Me and you.
- See how that fits.
- It's time.
- For what?
It's time for you to go.
Don't you turn your back on me,
nigger.
Rubin!
Rubin!
Ladies and gentlemen...
in this corner...
<i>In this corner,
from Paterson, New Jersey...</i>
<i>wearing the white trunks
with black stripes...</i>
<i>Rubin "Hurricane" Carter!</i>
- Okay, Sam. Are you joining us?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Lesra, get up back.
- Dear Rubin...
- I can't believe the warmth and beauty of your letter.
- Ready?
We get a rich, deep feeling
of experiencing your presence.
You've... You've made what we've
been saying the truth...
that you can't keep people back
who refuse to be kept back.
Here we go. Here we go.
We work out of our home, so we're
always here if you'd like to call.
We'd really like
to hear your voice.
You are very persuasive...
and I thank you
for all the things you send me...
but you people
are a bad influence on me.
I'm startin' to like all this stuff
a little too much.
You're lettin' me get loose.
Hello?
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.
Hey, Rube, what's happening, man?
Lesra, boy, you, uh... Well,
you sound more like a man every day.
Get outta here.
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, you know Canadians, man.
They're not happy unless they're outside, you know,
rakin' leaves or tappin' a tree for maple syrup.
I don't know how they do it, man.
It's cold out there too.
Hey, what's up, Rube?
Something happen?
Yeah, I, um...
heard from the courts, Lesra.
Been denied. I lost the appeal.
Oh, no, man. Well-Well,
look, look, look, hold on, Rube.
- Let me tell everyone, okay?
- I gotta go, little brother.
No, well, wait, Rube!
W-Wait! Wait. Wait. But, Rube!
Rubin!
What's going on?
Lost the appeal.
Oh, no.
Dear Lesra, Terry, Sam...
Lisa...
this is, in many ways, the saddest
letter I've ever had to write.
I appreciate your many efforts
and kindnesses...
but I am a prisoner.
My number is 45472, and my job,
the key to my survival...
"My number is 45472, and my job,
the key to my survival..."
lies in my ability to do the time.
This place is not one in which humanity
can survive. Only steel can.
This will be my last letter to you.
Please do not write.
Please do not visit.
Please find it in your hearts
to not weaken me with your love.
"Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."
Open up, Ken.
Okay.
Thanks.
Rubin.
I got a letter here
for you from Canada.
I'm just gonna slide it
in here for you.
You do what you want with it.
"Dear Rube..."
I know you asked us not to write...
so I'm not writing...
just sending you two things.
One's a picture of me
and my new girlfriend, Pauline.
The other...
is something that
rightfully belongs to you...
my high school diploma.
"Your friend and brother forever,
Lesra Martin."
<i>Don't count the stars</i>
<i>Or you might stumble</i>
Hello.
Yes, I accept...
I... I accept the charges.
Rubin? Hey.
R-Rubin, I-I-I can't hear you.
Rube...
Hello?
He said he can't do the time.
Uh, collect call to anyone...
from Mr Rubin Carter.
- Get it. Get it.
- Take one.
<i>- Yes.
- Rubin?</i>
<i>- Lesra? - No, it's Terry. I'm here
with Lisa and Sam, and Lesra's here.</i>
Hey. How y'all doin'?
<i>Look out the window.</i>
What?
<i>You see that light?
The one that's blinking?</i>
<i>You see it?</i>
Yeah.
<i>Can you see Lesra?</i>
Yeah, I see you.
What are y'all doin' here?
- Can he see us?
- Yeah, he can see you.
- Rube!
- We're here.
We've moved down here.
<i>- For what? - We're in this thing full-time
until you walk out of there.</i>
<i>Hold on.
Lisa wants to say something.</i>
Hurricane!
Hey, Rube.
<i>Looks like you got
some foot soldiers now, huh?</i>
We're all in this together,
and we're not leaving till we all leave.
You're beautiful.
We're gonna take you home.
Okay.
Okay.
Rubin has, uh, asked us to give you
copies of everything that we have...
and to answer any questions.
And since we've represented him
for over ten years...
there's an awful lot of material.
I mean, we have rooms
full of files.
Absolutely.
And, uh, please understand...
that we are not here
to second-guess you or...
You know, we... we've come down here
to help in any way we can.
Anything, you know.
Anything at all.
Well, that's very kind of you.
And I congratulate you
on your dedication to Rubin's case.
Uh, maybe I should add
that in those ten years...
we've been working on this,
we've donated our services.
We've never asked for a dime.
We never expect one. Do we?
- No.
- I wanted to be sure.
And also in that time, uh,
there have been a lot of people...
great people...
all well-intentioned.
- Famous.
- Infamous.
Or not. Boxers, singers,
writers, actors...
journalists, et cetera.
A lot of brave people
who gave their time...
and, to some degree,
risked their reputations.
People like you.
And, uh...
people come and go,
and, frankly, nobody lasts.
Nobody stays the course.
Nobody goes the distance,
because it's too tough.
It's too slow...
and it's heartbreaking.
- It's too heartbreaking.
- Well, with all due respect, Mr Friedman...
what you have to understand
is that we're here.
We've moved here, and we have every intention
of staying here until Rubin is free.
Right on.
So we finally got in to see your lawyers,
Beldock and Friedman, the other day.
- How'd they take it?
- Oh, I'd say we handled ourselves pretty well.
Yeah, well, we hauled about what, ten
tons of documents, into the apartment.
- In broad daylight? - Yeah. - Oh, yeah.
- Wait a minute. Listen to me.
This is not Canada.
Now, I can protect you in here...
but there's not much
I can do for you on the outside.
The only way I'm ever leaving
this place is if...
a lot of very important people
are exposed.
They're not gonna
just let that happen.
- You understand?
- We'll be careful.
Okay. Well, why don't you walk us
through what happened that night?
Now, three cops have testified
the shooting occurred at 2:45.
- So, uh, what time did you leave the Nite Spot?
- 2:30.
<i>Oh, now tell me where can you party
child, all night long</i>
<i>- In the basement
- Anybody call a cab?</i>
<i>- Oh, where did you go
- Time for me to get outta here.</i>
- How much do I owe you, Big Ed?
- Your money's no good here, champ.
- Anybody call a cab?
- I did, unless Rubin's taking me home.
If I take you,
it's gonna be more than home.
Get on outta here, girl.
Shit.
What were you doin' out so late
on a Thursday night?
- What does it matter what night it was?
- Wasn't Thursday night ladies' night?
Didn't it matter to your wife?
I'm in the penitentiary for murder,
not attempted adultery.
So there was a cab there.
He must have seen you leave, right?
No. No, he left before I did.
- Hey.
- Poor daddy goin' home.
- Bye, Rubin.
- Take it easy.
- Hey, champ.
- Huh? Hey!
Whoa! He's gone!
I wish to God John Artis
had met a girl that night.
I wish that, uh,
he hadn't been there at all.
He didn't deserve this.
He didn't deserve any of it.
Artis, let's go. You're done.
He got the same sentence I got,
and all he had to do...
was lie and say I killed
those people and...
they would have let him out
and his nightmare would have been over.
Most men couldn't have stood up
to that kind of torture...
but John Artis did.
The man is my hero.
So the police said it was 2:45
or a little after...
when all hell broke loose
at the Lafayette bar.
That's what they said.
Apparently, the two gunmen entered the
bar and immediately started shooting.
According to William Marins,
two guys barged in and just opened fire.
Oliver goes down first.
Nauyaks.
Then Marins was the only one
who got a look at 'em.
Then they shoot Hazel Tanis
and leave.
- What's Bello doing?
- Bello was a lookout for a burglary up the street.
- And who else saw anything?
- Patty Valentine.
She said she saw the getaway car.
And there was a man who lived across the
street by the name of Avery Cockersham.
Cockersham? That name
was in the police report.
- That's right.
- So how come he didn't testify?
The judge threw
the police report out.
Cockersham left town.
Nobody could find him.
It was two coloured guys. They just
walked in, they started shootin'.
Call the cops.
Now, according to the police,
the murders were racially motivated.
See, the bar didn't serve blacks, so
naturally this crazy nigger, Rubin Carter...
had to take out his vengeance
on the entire white race.
Uh, this is, uh, Exhibit 11 -F.
- This is 1966. - Wait a minute.
What are you talking about? Where are... Where are you?
- Trial transcripts, 1966.
- Oh. Stick to the blue cards.
- Valentine... Valentine first said...
- I know the blue cards.
The car's taillights
were similar to the getaway car.
- "Similar."
- Right. Then in '76, Exhibit 89-C, she says, quote...
"The Carter car was unquestionably
the same car. There was no doubt."
- Closed quote.
- Exactly.
Kinda makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Second trial, ten years later,
suddenly she changes her story.
She drew a picture,
like a bow tie.
Yeah. Yeah, I've got it here.
"Taillights lit up all across the back like a
butterfly, as the killer's car drove away."
"Like a butterfly."
So the first thing we have to do is find
out exactly what Rubin's car looked like.
- We need to find a '66 Dodge Polara.
- Mm-hmm.
There's the bow-tie lights,
like Patty Valentine described.
- I'm not so sure about that.
- You ready? - Yeah!
Yeah.
See that?
They don't light up all the way.
Oh, no, that's a Dodge Monaco.
You don't want one of those.
They don't have the power. Look,
I'll make you a good deal on this one.
- Shit.
- Monaco?
- Mr Carter?
- Yeah.
I was told to get you.
Get me? By whom?
The warden wants to see you.
- For what?
- I don't know.
Open up, Al.
Mr Carter.
I have a difficult job
running this place...
but I do it.
I do it really well.
You called me down here
at 3:00 in the morning to tell me that?
I hear things.
I hear everything.
What have you heard, Warden?
I hear something's goin' down.
I don't want a mess,
something that I can't clean up.
This doesn't have anything
to do with my case, does it?
Shit happens every day...
and I wanna warn you, that's all.
Somebody tries to take you down,
something gets started...
I can't stop it.
- You understand me?
- What do you suggest I do?
Stay alive.
And that goes for your friends too.
Guard.
- Who is it?
- We're looking for an Avery Cockersham.
Do the Cockershams live here?
I'm Mrs Cockersham.
What do you want?
You're black.
You're white.
Baked fresh this morning.
Now, you take the white one.
Yeah, there were plenty coloured folks
in the neighbourhood...
and in the bar too.
- Avery and me were regulars.
- They served blacks in the bar?
We had a running tab.
So much for the racial motive, eh?
My Avery got a good look
at those men...
and it wasn't Rubin Carter.
He told the police.
He told 'em and he told 'em.
He even signed a statement
for that detective.
You know the one. Heavy set.
He looked like
a bulldog with glasses.
- Della Pesca.
- That's the one.
Could we, uh,
talk with your husband?
Avery's dead.
He died just before the trial.
I'm sorry.
Here's stuff I wanna check out.
What is this?
Who the fuck you think you are?
- Does this look like Toronto to you?
- Excuse me?
You know, you people, you got
some nerve comin' down here...
pokin' your nose
where it don't belong.
Let me ask you something,
Mr Canada.
What the fuck do you know
about this place, huh? Huh?
You know anything?
You don't know shit.
Let me enlighten you...
because you don't know
what you're doin'.
You are making enemies
that you don't know exist.
- Huh?
- We know about you.
You don't know shit about me.
You understand?
You don't know shit about this place,
and let me tell ya something else.
You're not welcome here, okay?
You're not fuckin' welcome here.
You got that?
Go back to where you belong.
Lesra's gonna have to get on
with school, so...
we might want to send him back
for a while.
- I understand. It's probably the best.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- What about you?
Oh, it's... it's gonna take
a little longer than we thought.
Y'all all right?
Yeah.
I have asked myself, Lisa...
if I could do for anyone...
what you and Sam and Terry and Lesra
have done for me, and the answer is no.
- So if you feel like you need to go home...
- Shh. We're not...
for any reason,
I'll understand. You...
No, you gotta understand.
We're not...
We're not leaving without you.
All right?
And we're gonna find something.
Um, well, I found something...
a fellow by the name of Barbieri.
He's a private investigator. Prosecution
hired him in the second trial.
- Didn't he resign from the case or something?
- He quit...
and he turned in his murder book
and crime-scene photos...
list of evidence, but no notes.
- Anyone talk to him?
- Myron tracked him down.
- What'd he say?
- Nothin'. He was scared.
- Of whom?
- Of the people he was workin' with.
- Mrs Barbieri?
- Miss.
- Hello. Uh, is Mr Barbieri in?
- There isn't any mister.
Uh, Dominick, Dominick Barbieri?
That was my father.
He passed away years ago.
Wow. Maybe you oughta have
a yard sale.
That case always bothered
my father.
He never talked about it. He said
he had to live in this town, you know?
Yeah. Do you have any idea
where his notes might be?
Well, if he kept them at all,
they'd be in one of those boxes.
Guy was a pack rat. He must have saved
every case he ever worked on.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?
- I found it. Look at this. Look.
- What?
- He kept a damn diary.
- Oh, look.
Who would have thought he'd put it
in a diary? But he did. Look at this.
There.
A call was placed to
an emergency operator named Jean Wahl...
at 2:28 a.m. to report the shooting.
- At 2:28?
- That's right.
She then calls the cops
to tell them.
They say they already know about it.
In fact...
they've got a cruiser on its way
over to the Lafayette at that moment.
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.
According to Barbieri...
"time on the record
of customer contact was changed...
from 2:28 to 2:45."
- Yes.
- Son of a bitch.
Which, if true,
puts John Artis and myself...
at the Nite Spot
at the time of the killings.
Well, if we can prove
she got the call at 2:28.
We'll prove it.
We can prove it.
Mrs Wahl?
Hi. My name is Sam Chaiton.
We spoke on the phone about the Rubin Carter case.
- I told you, I don't want to talk to you.
- Mrs Wahl, please.
Um, you told an investigator
named Barbieri...
that an emergency call you took the night
of the Lafayette bar murders was at 2:28.
I don't know what I told him.
It was a long time ago.
Uh, but there's a card
that says 2:45 on it...
and, uh, you didn't sign the card.
According to Barbieri, it was signed
by a Miss Lenore Harkinson.
- She was my supervisor.
- Why would your supervisor sign the card?
And wouldn't you normally
do that yourself?
Look, if there's a card and that's
what it says, then that's what it says.
I don't remember anything else. And if someone tries
to make me testify, that's just what I'll say.
Uh, look, Mrs Wahl...
Thank you.
So this is a copy of the phone
company's record of customer contact.
It's all there,
just like Barbieri said.
2:45.
Look at the signature on the card.
It's signed by Lenora Harkinson,
Jean Wahl's supervisor.
Does that mean anything to you?
It means she didn't have
to write up a phoney ticket.
What?
He signed it himself.
Who?
His handwriting is
on every report that...
put me in prison
since I was 11 years old.
It's Della Pesca.
It's his handwriting.
- Oh, shit! What's happening?
- What the hell is that?
- Don't know.
- What is that?
- Oh, shit!
- Hold on!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Les, you okay?
- I'm all right. - Are ya?
- Are you all right? Yeah?
- I think so. Damn.
- Yeah?
- Shit.
- Hey, you okay?
- What the fuck was that?
- Need help?
We're okay. Thanks.
- Are they all right?
- Goddam.
The car just went right over
the centre divider...
Rubin, the law states we have to take our new
evidence back to the original trial judge...
- and then if he turns us down, we go to the state appeals court...
- No. No, no, no, no!
Listen to me. These people
aren't gonna just let that happen.
They've made their careers
on my case.
- What are you talking about, Rubin?
- I'm talking about lawyers, prosecutors, judges...
who have moved up the ladder
on my black back.
We don't even know what enemies
we have out there in this state.
We gotta take it out of New Jersey, and
we gotta take it to the federal court.
Rubin, if you go
into federal court...
with new evidence that hasn't been
heard in the state court...
the judge is gonna throw
it out, okay?
- That is the law.
- Then we transcend the law.
We, we, we get back to humanity.
You said it yourself.
You said if we take the new evidence...
before the federal judge, he's gotta look
at it before he throws it out, right?
- Right. - I believe that once he looks
at it, he will have seen the truth.
Having seen the truth,
he can't turn his back on me.
And what if you're wrong
and he does turn away? Then what?
Then you throw out all this evidence
that everyone's fought so hard to get.
And you know what, Rubin? You will never be
able to mention it in a court of law again.
It is finished. It's erased.
It's as if it never happened.
This evidence is the key to getting you out of
here, and you'll be throwing it away, Rubin...
- when in a few more years...
- I don't have a few more years, Myron!
- Leon, help me out.
- I can't.
I agree with Rubin.
It's time to move on.
- Move on? What do you mean, move on? Move on where?
- The state's biased, Myron.
We're never gonna get anything there.
We have to go federal.
- We can't take the risk of going federal with this.
- Listen to me. Listen to me!
I'm 50 years old.
I've been locked up
here for 30 years.
I've put a lot of
good people's lives at risk.
Now, either I get outta here...
Get me outta here.
Ready?
Good luck, Rubin.
This is for you.
You stay strong.
- Good luck.
- My man. Peace, baby. Be cool now.
Good luck, Mr Carter.
- Rubin.
- Rubin Carter, prisoner 45472.
- See you around.
- Okay, Jimmy.
Your Honour, we appear before you...
in our 19th year before the courts.
Rubin Carter has never enjoyed
a full, fair...
and unforced disclosure
of the facts...
to which he is
constitutionally entitled.
For 19 years,
the truth has been hidden...
not only from Rubin Carter's eyes...
- but from the eyes of justice itself and...
- Uh, Your Honour.
The prosecution
objects forcefully here.
Counsel is attempting
to present new evidence...
and circumvent
the State Court of New Jersey.
Your Honour must,
according to the law...
drop this entire petition
where it belongs... into the garbage.
Your Honour, we implore you
to at least hear us...
before making your ruling.
Mr Beldock, I hope you understand...
the implications of your action.
That is a very slippery slope...
you're trying to climb.
- We do, Your Honour.
- Proceed.
In 1976, the State of New Jersey's...
chief investigator of this case,
Dominick Barbieri...
resigned because he
discovered the truth.
He discovered
that this case was built...
on a foundation
of forgeries and lies.
Those lies show the guilt
not of Rubin Carter...
but of a corrupt police force
and the prosecutor's office.
And now this wall of lies
has been destroyed...
so that this court
may finally see the truth...
and, pray God,
not turn its eyes away.
This court is
not unmoved by your...
eloquence and passion...
but the prosecution is correct.
This petition
contains new evidence...
that has not been presented
before the State Court of New Jersey...
and there is no legal argument
that you could make...
which would allow me to consider it.
Therefore, you have
two choices before you:
I can send this case
back to the state court...
and you can present the evidence...
or, if you insist...
on, uh, proceeding...
this evidence will be lost
to you forever.
You understand the choice
before you, Mr Beldock?
Your Honour, may I request
a moment to confer with my client?
That's the smartest thing
you've said all morning, Counsellor.
Rubin, listen to me. This judge is telling
us as clearly as he possibly can...
that he's going
to rule against you.
- This is our last stand, Myron.
- Rubin, I am begging you...
Let's proceed.
Your Honour, my client wishes
to continue with this proceeding.
Uh, do you do so formally...
and, uh, are you aware of the, uh...
significance of such an action?
We do so formally.
- Proceed.
- But, Your Honour...
- Yes?
- Uh, the state is not prepared...
to proceed to argue
the merits of this case.
Why not?
Well, we, we assumed...
that the court would not hear
this petition based on new evidence.
You assumed wrong.
Proceed.
So, Your Honour, this case
was poisoned from the start.
No evidence.
No witnesses,
except admitted liars.
Only a racially charged atmosphere...
which was fanned by the police
and the prosecutors...
who knew the truth
and distorted it...
and subverted it and destroyed it...
to convict an innocent man.
What more can the State
of New Jersey do, Your Honour...
than give a man not one...
but two jury trials?
And nothing has changed since then.
Mr Carter is, and always has been,
a menace to society.
He's been in and out of jail
his whole life.
A criminal.
He's a violent man.
His whole life has been violence.
And it is our duty, Your Honour,
to continue to protect...
the general public
from such a man.
Thank you.
I've heard your statements.
Uh, I'll take them under consideration.
Now, is there anything else
that counsel wishes to add...
before I make my final ruling?
- What are you doing? - I want to say something.
- What are you gonna say?
I want to...
I need to say something.
Uh, Your Honour, m-my...
my client, Mr Carter...
wishes to address the court.
Request granted.
Thank you, Your Honour.
I was a, um...
prizefighter.
My job was to...
take all the hatred...
and skill that I could muster...
and send a man to his destruction,
and I did that.
But Rubin "Hurricane" Carter
is no murderer.
Twenty years I've spent
locked up in a cage...
considered a danger to society.
Not treated like a human being.
Not treated like a person.
Counted 15 times a day.
I serve my time
in a house of justice...
and yet, there's
no justice for me.
So, I ask you
to consider the evidence.
Don't turn away from the truth.
Don't turn away from your conscience.
Please, don't ignore the law.
No, em-embrace that...
higher principle for which
the law was meant to serve.
Justice. That's all
I ask for, Your Honour.
Justice.
This court is in recess.
Oh, thank you.
It's good.
Come a long way,
huh, little brother?
Yeah.
Look, Rubin, I just want you to know
if this doesn't work...
I'm bustin' you outta here.
- You are?
- Yeah. That's right.
I'm bustin' you outta here.
What was the first book
you ever bought?
Yours.
You think that was an accident?
- No.
- No, me neither.
Lesra, short for Lazarus.
"He who has risen from the dead."
Rubin.
Genesis, chapter 29, verse 32.
"Behold a son."
You put those two together, Lesra,
and you have...
"Behold a son who is risen...
from the dead."
That's no accident.
Hate put me in prison.
Love's gonna bust me out.
Just in case love doesn't,
I'm gonna bust you outta here.
Yeah.
You already have, Lesra.
All rise.
This Federal District Court
of New Jersey is now in session.
Judge Sarokin presiding.
Be seated.
This court does not arrive
at its conclusion lightly.
On one hand, Rubin Carter
has submitted a document...
alleging racial prejudice...
coercion of testimony
and withholding of evidence.
On the other hand...
Mr Carter was tried twice...
by two different juries...
and those convictions
were subsequently upheld...
by the New Jersey
State Supreme Court.
He's gonna rule against us.
Rubin's gonna lose.
However, the extensive record...
clearly demonstrates
to this court...
that Rubin Carter's conviction...
was predicated upon an appeal...
to racism...
rather than reason...
and concealment...
rather than disclosure.
To permit convictions to stand...
which have
as their sole foundation...
appeals to racial prejudice...
is to commit...
a violation...
of the Constitution...
as heinous as the crimes
for which the defendants...
were tried...
and convicted.
I hereby order Rubin Carter...
- released from prison...
- Yes!
Henceforth, from this day forward.
Yes! Yes.
This court is adjourned.
Hey, Rube, you made... you made it, man!
You're free! Can you stand it?
You did it, Rube.
You did it, man.
- Yeah, huh?
- Yeah!
<i>Rubin Carter has just been freed.</i>
All right!
You're free, Rubin!
Mr Carter.
Hey, Mr Carter.
Mr Carter.
Mr Carter? Mr Carter?
Mr Carter? Now that you're out,
a-are you still gonna be The Hurricane?
Oh, I'll always be The Hurricane.
And The Hurricane is beautiful.
This is unbelievable!
The crowd is going wild.
Everybody wanted this victory,
and Hurricane has delivered.
<i>Yes, that's the story
of The Hurricane</i>
<i>But it won't be over
till they clear his name</i>
<i>And give him back
the time he's done</i>
<i>Put in a prison cell
but one time</i>
<i>He could have been
the champion of the world</i>
<i>When your life's a wall</i>
<i>Can't see the light of day</i>
<i>When your hope is gone</i>
<i>When you second-guess your faith</i>
<i>When you turn around</i>
<i>And realize that no one else</i>
<i>Will believe in you</i>
<i>Only yourself</i>
<i>When you're holding on</i>
<i>You can't find the will to breathe</i>
<i>Can you right the wrong</i>
<i>That has brought you to your knees</i>
<i>Though you barely lived your life</i>
<i>You keep on believing you'll survive</i>
<i>And all that's left is what's inside</i>
<i>Amazing, I have heard my inner voice</i>
<i>That I need to rejoice</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i>
<i>- And way down
- Never thought that I would need</i>
<i>Amazing but now that I am free</i>
<i>Amazing and now I'm</i>
<i>Free</i>
<i>Amazing, now</i>
<i>I am free</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah
A hurricane forever</i>
<i>Imagine you lie down forever</i>
<i>Could you stand forever
Could you hold it together</i>
<i>I can't even explain the pain</i>
<i>Imagine if your life
was like a hurricane</i>
<i>A hurricane forever
Imagine you lie down</i>
<i>Forever, ever, ever</i>
<i>Could you hold it together Yo,
I can't explain the pain with words</i>
<i>You know what I'm sayin, 'Just imagine
if your life was like a hurricane</i>
<i>The clouds cracked
and the heaven's gate was stormed</i>
<i>God placed it on man
on the day he was born</i>
<i>Convicted minutes after
a true natural disaster</i>
<i>Framed for manslaughter
The Hurricane Carter rising</i>
<i>Come up from south water
like torrential rain</i>
<i>In the ring
no opponent escaped unscathed</i>
<i>You can't believe
The world we live in is unjust</i>
<i>All I see is more proof
There's no place for us</i>
<i>They had my man Carter
locked in a cage like an animal</i>
<i>Robbed him to a point
where the mind worked mechanical</i>
<i>Or worse by remote control
It was done to all of us</i>
<i>They tapped directly into our soul</i>
<i>Either up at Sing-Sing
or these bars around our mind</i>
<i>There's nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide</i>
<i>And it's six-by-six
a guilty man cried</i>
<i>For penitence and losses
where innocence is</i>
<i>Hurricane
Could you lie down forever</i>
<i>Could you stand forever
Could you hold it together</i>
<i>I can't even explain the pain
hear what I'm sayin'</i>
<i>Your life was like a hurricane A hurricane
forever Imagine behind bars forever</i>
<i>Could you stand it
Could you live for that</i>
<i>Tough for that
Chunk of that to know the pain</i>
<i>Your life was like a hurricane</i>
