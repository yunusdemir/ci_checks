- But l told her.
- You told her?
l told her, ''I don't believe
your father dived 400 metres
''and harpooned a whale.''
Was I right, Cookie?
Of course you were.
lt's not money l'm after.
l told you, it's not blackmail.
l'm obliged to report it.
l know it's disastrous for you.
Wait. My shoelace is undone.
Lori, have a look at that car
we just past. Who's inside?
Here.
There are two people inside.
l can only see the one who's talking.
Yes, I can wait a few days.
After that I'm not sure.
- Goodnight, Cookie.
- Goodnight, Sweetie.
- Don't work too late.
- I'll just finish my crossword.
Sleep tight.
Lori...
I tolf you, it's not blackmail.
Not blackmail... not blackmail...
This hot chick calls me.
She says,
''Your shirt is ready to collect.''
l go into the changing room
to try it on, and wham!
She whips off her t-shirt
and is naked underneath.
- What did you do?
- I bought another 30 shirts!
See you later. It's all yours.
He's asleep.
Damn him.
Oh my God!
Wait there.
- Watch that stick!
- Sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
- What did you say?
- I said sorry, it was my fault.
- That's what I thought.
- Here, your cane.
Tell me, what happened here?
A robbery, I think.
Someone beat up the guard.
- When?
- Last night. l'm not sure what time.
- Are you a cop?
- No, I'm a journalist. Excuse me.
- What is your name?
- Giordani.
Press.
Who's the inspector? Spimi?
He's inside. They're all there.
l didn't see anything.
He came from behind.
Over here.
lt must be something big.
All the top brass
from headquarters are here.
- What was stolen?
- Not a thing.
Any photos?
Professor Terzi,
the big boss and his assistants:
Esson, Casoni, Mombelli.
And Braun the German. All here.
Hello, Spimi.
l'll sum it up for you
so you might leave us in peace.
lt happened at 10:15pm.
The doctor on duty noticed it.
The thief beat up the guard,
broke in, then stole nothing.
Not a test tube,
not a paper clip, nothing.
Not even a piece of paper.
Odd, eh?
Where's my father?
Anna Terzi. The boss' daughter.
What do they research here?
Genetics, biology.
Biochemistry. Heredity.
They even do pre-nuptial visits
for people with loads of cash
who want top quality offspring.
They come in, see a pretty nurse,
jack off, and bang!
They're told
if they have a hereditary disease.
- Or if their gun's jammed.
- Just this bang-bang thing, then?
No, they also do
other important studies, top secret.
Our research is undertaken
with international partners.
lt's highly confidential
so l must ask you...
Ah, Anna. Come in.
My daughter.
These gentlemen
are investigating the case.
Sit down, dear.
Anna helps me in my work.
She knows everything.
So, gentlemen, as I was saying,
our research
has far-reaching implications.
Without further tests
it can't be made public.
lt could be misunderstood,
so since nothing was stolen...
Excuse me, Professor,
we can't rule out espionage.
Documents could have been copied
without being taken away.
Casoni, I'm in charge of this institute.
l can make decisions
without your advice.
Not only that.
There's no evidence
to suggest espionage.
Unless you know something we don't.
- What? I know nothing.
- Exactly.
There's no point fabricating stories.
However, I asked my staff to check
if any documents have been disturbed.
They reported that nothing
was out of the ordinary.
So... the professor is right.
We shouldn't overreact.
Hello? Yes, he's here.
Just a moment.
l'm not interested in the reason.
l know, but as I said last night...
l can't see why...
l see. OK, see you at 5:00.
- Hi, Bianca.
- Hi.
Why are the police here?
They nearly didn't let me in.
Someone broke in last night.
Really? What did they take?
Look, I can't leave right now.
l still have some things to do.
l'll pick you up at home later, OK?
- I'm sorry.
- All right.
Listen to me.
l'm the only one who knows
what was stolen. And who stole it.
- Are you going to tell the police?
- No.
l'm not telling anyone
for the time being.
But this could be a big boost
for my career.
- When's she arriving?
- Any minute now.
Hey, we forgot about the starlet.
Come on, she's getting off.
That's it. Big smile.
- Smile, please.
- Hello, boys.
- Stand still.
- Is this OK?
Smile, bitch.
Your train just crushed a guy.
- Hi, Cookie.
- Hi, Sweetie.
Shall I read the paper?
RESEARCHER
BEHEADED BY TRAIN
ls the puzzle hard?
- You try. Go on.
- 'C'... 'H'...
- Chopper.
- Like this. 'C'... 'H'... Ear. Cheer.
He's dead.
Who's dead?
The man who was in the car last night.
- The one talking, remember?
- Yes.
The paper says,
''Train Crushes Scientist.
''Dr Calabresi, famous researcher
at the Terzi lnstitute
''was killed in an accident
at the city's main station.''
- There's even a photo.
- Describe it.
A small photo of the man.
Then there's a bigger one.
lt shows him falling...
in front of the train.
Who wrote the article?
Carlo Giordani.
- Do you remember me?
- Of course. How are you?
- Who are you?
- Lori. This is my uncle.
- I just came to ask...
- Come into my office.
l didn't have time
to introduce myself yesterday.
Please sit down.
Here we go.
My name's Franco Arno.
l've come about
the death of Dr Calabresi.
You must have noticed the coincidence:
the theft at the institute
and the death of a scientist,
all in the space of a few hours.
But actually, it wasn't really a theft.
And Calabresi's death was an accident.
Our photographer even got a photo.
That's just what I wanted
to talk to you about.
The photo shows Dr Calabresi
as he's falling, right?
Your photographer -
did he ask the laboratory
to enlarge a detail?
Or was the whole photo printed?
How do you know all this?
How do I know? Let me explain.
l was blinded in an accident.
But before that
l was a journalist, like you.
Oh, I didn't know.
Wipe that look of pity off your face.
l can't see it but I know it's there.
Believe me, l wasn't...
That's much better, now then...
- Was the photo cropped?
- Cropped?
l don't know, let's find out.
Ask the photographer
to look closely at the film.
No, I didn't print it all.
l cropped the left side.
- Have you got the film?
- Yes.
Look at it under a magnifying glass.
Well, I'll be damned.
l hadn't noticed. There's a hand.
lt's a bit blurred
but you can certainly see it.
lt looks like...
...someone pushed him under the train.
Print it. All of it. I'm on my way.
All right.
l bet you were an ace reporter.
Let's get the photo.
Why didn't you tell the cops?
Who'd listen to a blind man
and a kid?
Anyway, this is more fun.
l love solving puzzles.
What's wrong?
My friend, the photographer, is dead.
He was killed, then disfigured.
You should go. I've called the police.
Let the cream thicken
for ten minutes.
Add pepper, nutmeg, butter
and a drop or two of cognac.
Meanwhile, put the pasta
in a warm bowl and...
l don't give a damn
about your wife's pasta.
- I was just making conversation.
- Very kind of you.
l'd like to know where Spimi has got to.
l'm here.
l had to wait for the doctor's report.
He thinks it's a maniac.
First, he strangles Righetto.
Then uses a razor, or a blade.
Something very sharp.
Thanks. See you later.
Do me a favour, Giordani.
Don't link the two deaths.
lt might alert the murderer.
Or murderers.
Do you believe the maniac theory?
That's what the doctor says.
But what do you think?
l don't have any leads.
Only a hunch.
What was Calabresi like?
A bit lifeless.
He lived alone. He was from Padua.
Did he have a wife or a lover?
You're never satisfied,
are you, Giordani?
He was engaged and madly in love.
Her name is Bianca Merusi.
A nice girl.
That's all for now.
Mombelli. About 40. Talking to Casoni.
Casoni is about 28. They're arguing.
Now Esson, about 40, in a hurry.
Here's Braun, the German.
Very elegant.
He has a chauffeur driven white Jaguar.
And finally, Terzi and his daughter Anna.
A handsome guy, doesn't look his age.
As for Anna... She's quite a peach.
The cops are on Terzi's tail.
- Why's that?
- I'll tell you why.
They know that the key to the puzzle
lies inside the institute.
Calabresi was killed
because he discovered something.
Something very important.
- Who is it? Lori?
- Yes.
Say hello to Giordani.
Hello.
- Hi, Cookie.
- Hi, Sweetie.
Why do you call him Cookie?
Cookies are sweet
and I love them dunked in chocolate.
We're both alone in the world.
l have no family
and she lost her parents.
We're more than father and daughter.
- Well, I'll be off.
- Where to?
To talk to Bianca, Calabresi's fianc√©e.
lf I were you, I'd go and see
Professor Terzi's daughter.
He's a widower, you said.
Yes.
Men who are alone
confide in their daughters.
Meanwhile,
Lori and I will drop in on Bianca.
We have a little hunch, don't we?
Yes.
All right. You follow your hunch.
You're starting to enjoy this.
More exciting than your puzzles.
LATEST DETAILS
ON PHOTOGRAPHER'S MURDER
THE WEAPON: A RAZOR?
Honestly, these reporters.
Have you read the article?
lt says that the killer
might be a barber.
Those are the exact words.
Right, Pepe?
A mad barber? I ask you.
Where do reporters get their ideas?
Put your head back.
Feeling a bit hot, sir?
lt's totally absurd.
Let's suppose one of us goes crazy
and cuts someone up with a razor.
We wouldn'tjust hack him at random.
Think about it.
Years and years of handling
our customers' throats.
Always careful
to avoid the slightest slip.
lf one lost his rag,
what would he do?
Lop off a nose or an ear?
No, he'd grab a razor, and zap!
A clean slash.
Did l hurt you?
l haven't finished.
- Do it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
Then she adds some ham,
chopped very finely,
and a tiny clove of garlic.
Do you like garlic?
- No, it gives me heartburn.
- Pity.
- Yes?
- Professor Terzi, please.
- You are?
- Never mind, it's urgent.
- The professor isn't in.
- And his daughter, Anna?
She's not in either.
- The institute is on fire.
- What? A fire?
- Hey, where are you going?
- Where's the professor?
- Out, I said.
- In here?
- I bet he's upstairs.
- He isn't.
- We'll see about that.
- What is it?
This madman forced his way in.
- Who are you?
- Carlo Giordani.
l'm a reporter. Can I talk to you?
- No, I'm busy.
- It's important. lt's about the murder.
What murder?
- Calabresi's.
- But it was an accident.
So they say, but it was murder.
Very well. Come up.
l'll see you later.
- Signorina Merusi?
- Yes.
Would you mind if we talked?
Esson? Come up a minute, please.
Goodbye.
You could do with
learning some manners.
Poor Esson. Take pity on him.
l just refused to be his mistress
for the hundredth time.
What's your name?
Carlo Giordani. As I said earlier.
- Are you always so frank?
- Not always.
Why the secrets with my father?
l gave him some information.
And he gave me some.
- And then?
- He decided to investigate certain facts.
- And me others.
- Such as?
To do with the institute.
There's no need to be mysterious
after forcing your way in.
You are rude. Bloody journalist.
You're not so refined.
Look at the way you're sitting,
showing off me your legs.
Can't say I'm impressed,
although your legs aren't bad.
You don't like my manner?
l've tried changing but I can't.
So be it.
What a tirade!
l deserve it. Let's call a truce.
Take me somewhere. Come on.
l'm sorry I can't help.
lf the police can't find it
in this house, how can l?
lt was just an idea.
Excuse the intrusion.
Lori, what did she have
round her neck?
A watch on a gold chain.
An old watch with a photo
of the dead man.
Hello. lt's Bianca.
We may be in trouble.
Some guy has been round.
See the car behind us?
lt's the police. Watch this.
They're mad.
There aren't any seatbelts.
- Scared?
- No.
Crazy idiots!
Thanks.
My father founded the institute.
He recently hired
four genetics experts.
They're working on two projects.
One is on a revolutionary new drug.
The other is a government project.
lt's highly confidential research
into the variation of chromosomes XYY
which apparently indicates
criminal tendencies.
l've read about research in the US -
an interesting theory.
Notjust interesting,
it's explosive.
lt's already been used
by the defence in four criminal trials.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I'm just a bit edgy.
So many odd things have happened.
Like what?
Nothing important.
lt's probablyjust my imagination.
You asked about my father's assistants.
Esson you've met.
He's English. Well respected.
Outside ofwork
he has a good sense of humour.
But at work he can be very hard.
Even violent.
Mombelli's a good technician,
but without much ambition.
He lives in my father's shadow.
And Casoni.
The prodigy of the group.
He got his doctorate very young.
He's had a brilliant career
with international recognition.
Then there's Braun.
- A strange guy.
- In what way?
He hangs out at St Peter's Club.
Professor Braun?
- Yes?
- Can we talk?
Of course. Join us.
No, thank you.
lt's a delicate matter.
All right.
l'll be right back.
Please, sit down.
So, what is it?
- Well, I just...
- Wow, what wonderful eyes.
- Really?
- Stupendous.
Blue shot with red. Very rare.
lt's rare? I didn't know.
- What do you do?
- I'm a journalist.
Don't go.
l want to talk to you about the institute.
lt's OK, Manuel. Everything's fine.
Calabresi was in fact murdered.
- Really?
- And I have a hunch.
Someone at the lab is selling
information about the secret drug.
That's your opinion.
What can I say?
- Am l right or wrong?
- I'm not the least bit interested.
There's a spy. So what?
l'm a scientist, not a detective.
l've already been questioned
three times by the police.
Very embarrassing.
What did you tell them?
Everything I know.
That is...
...nothing.
Do you want some advice?
Leave the investigating to them.
lndustrial espionage is hot stuff.
A dangerous game.
You might get your fingers burnt.
The car.
At the station.
Stop.
Wait here.
5:00pm - Station Appointment with...
Here's what we've got so far.
The five scientists.
With Anna, that makes six.
And Bianca Merusi.
Seven.
The missing photographs.
Eight.
The break-in at the institute.
Nine.
- Anything else?
- No, nothing else.
That's all, then.
Nine leads to follow.
A cat with nine tails.
Cat o' nine tails - the navy whip.
lfwe could grab just one,
we might solve the puzzle.
We must be quick
because the killer is getting desperate.
- Shall I get it?
- No, let me.
- Hello.
- It's Bianca Merusi.
l know who murdered my fianc√©.
Yes. Of course.
l'm...
Just a minute. Don't hang up.
l heard a noise in the back.
l'll take a look.
No, I'm not imagining it.
l found a note that proves it.
Give it to the police for me.
Yes, I want the murderer caught.
But l want to stay out of it.
All right.
l'll explain when I see you.
OK, see you in a short while.
She was murdered.
That's why she didn't show up.
Damn it.
The police found
something interesting in her flat.
But l don't know what it was.
l also have some news.
This came this morning.
A PUZZLE ENTHUSIAST
AND A REPORTER DECIDED
TO FIND OUT WHY
SOME PEOPLE DIE
AND ENDED UP
ON THE SAME LIST
l thought we'd kept out of it
but no such luck. He's onto us.
Looks like it.
- Does it worry you?
- I'm not worried about myself.
lt's Lori I'm worried for.
l've sent her away.
To an old friend's.
Good.
So, what next?
We drop everything and save our skins.
That would be sensible.
By the way, I've been investigating
our researchers.
Mombelli is clean, but Casoni...
He was fired from his lastjob.
l couldn't find out why
but his past is a bit dubious.
Aren't all our pasts
a little bit dubious?
Braun is living the high life.
Villas, yachts, parties.
Where does he get the money?
Professor Terzi, may I talk to you?
l'm afraid I'm about to go out.
- It's important. May I come in?
- Very well.
This is strictly confidential.
- Swear you won't publish it.
- Of course.
First, we're on our way
to developing a wonder drug
which will eliminate
hereditary diseases and deformities.
Second, there's the XYY.
As you know, chromosome structure
is made up of X and Y genes.
To simplify this,
a shape has been devised
in the form of a triangle, like this.
lt's composed of rows
of alternating X and Y genes.
This triangle ends
with an X and a Y.
Except that in very rare cases
the structure ends
in an X followed by two Ys.
Well, recently
an American research team
examined the inmates of a prison
and made an amazing discovery.
Of the 200 convicted murderers
examined,
a very high percentage
had the extremely rare XYY pattern.
So this XYY pattern
indicates a criminal tendency?
At least a tendency
to abnormal aggression.
You can see that this would challenge
both psychoanalysis
and the present state penal system.
So, to totally eliminate
crime and violence,
you would simply examine
children at birth
and isolate those with the XYY pattern.
l see.
Any thoughts about the break-in
and the murders?
Of course.
But don't expect me to tell you.
l value my life too highly.
No, I have no suspicions.
lt's just been a series of accidents
and coincidences.
The police and press
are the ones looking for connections.
But there aren't any.
- So everything's normal?
- Absolutely.
Have many people had the XYY test?
Who told you about our research?
Professor Terzi.
About 500 people in total.
lncluding the staff from the institute?
Yes. All of us.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l'm very busy.
Goodbye.
- Goodnight.
- How are things?
Not so great.
The humidity is bad for my rheumatism.
lnspector Spimi?
No, he'sjust gone out.
Ask him to phone Carlo Giordani.
-Certainly.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Come in.
- Nice place.
- Thanks.
- How come...?
- What?
Paying a visit at this time of night.
l wanted a chat.
A chat? With me?
Are you tired of your friends?
l might want new friends.
Why did you come?
Stop being so defensive.
l just didn't expect to see you.
Well, I'm here now.
Right.
l'm sorry. Would you like a drink?
l've only got milk.
No, thank you.
Do you know how many people
make love every second?
- No.
- 780, on average. Seriously.
And I wouldn't like
to lower the average.
l realised that.
But l wanted to see what trick
you'd use to get me into bed.
None at all.
- Milk?
- Yes, please.
- Hello.
- It's Arno, they tried...
- What?
- ...to kill me by tampering with my gas.
I onlyjust had time
to open the window.
Oh my God.
No problem at your end?
They'll probably try. Watch out.
Right. Thanks.
Did you drink any?
- Got the idea?
- What's going on?
They tried to kill me, the milk.
lt's poisoned.
You be careful too.
Stay away from the city.
You think I should?
My father wants us to go
to our country place this weekend.
Then go.
For the weekend, you said?
When will you be back?
Sunday night.
Polecat, hound dog, skunk.
Coon, turd, crud.
Slimeball, bed-wetter, snot-nose.
The priest: 125.
Gigi the Loser:
137 insults without stopping.
The winner is Gigi the Loser.
Cough up.
Ball-breaker. l forgot that one.
l see you're in good form.
You got some new ones.
l had a Tunisian cellmate.
He knew a few that l didn't.
Have you got a minute?
- Gigi, I need a favour.
- Go ahead.
- For old times' sake.
- Anything you say.
l need a little job doing.
Only you can do it.
Have you gone crazy?
Forget it, I'm straight now.
l'm helping Mother in the shop.
No, this is different.
Do you like melons? l have loads.
lt's easy. It will be fine.
Nothing's easy for me. l get arrested
just for looking at a Cinquecento.
lt's no coincidence
that I'm called Gigi the Loser.
Look, it's not a robbery.
We're not stealing anything.
- We're just opening a few drawers.
- Locked?
Well, probably.
Breaking and entering -
three years and seven months.
Wouldn't it be funny if Professor Terzi
came back and surprised us?
Done.
lt happens.
- Not bad.
- Come on.
- Are you sure no one's in?
- Definitely.
You said no one was home.
Son of a bitch.
l was misinformed.
Wait. Now we're inside, let's do it.
Yes, but we're locked in.
Can't you even open a door?
All right, but make it quick.
Gigi, come here.
Callard and Smith. 1953.
Piece of cake.
''Anna Marini, born 26th April 1948
and resident in this city...
''...declares that Fulvio Terzi
adopts Anna Marini.''
She's not his daughter.
Open it.
''I founded the institute.
lt will carry my name.
''There's something wrong with me. I am
unable to have normal relationships...
''Professor P. says it's a question
of induced fantasies.
''Anna is a very beautiful girl.
She will become a splendid woman.
''I adore her. l ask myself, does
a father normally have these feelings?
''Anna has turned 18.
l am happy when she is near me.
''Why does Anna despise me?
She doesn't love me. I'm sure of it.''
Let's go.
What did you find out?
Don't get mad. I can't tell you.
We have a press conference tomorrow.
A press conference?
But you promised...
To give you exclusivity?
Try to understand, it wouldn't be right.
You're a real bastard.
Naturally. Cops are all bastards.
We force confessions, we're corrupt.
We bash students' heads in.
On the other hand, l've got some
gossipmongers for assistants.
Morsella, for example.
He has a very loose tongue.
He can never keep a secret.
l'll shut him up one of these days.
l bet if you went to see him
he'd probably let slip
that in Bianca Merusi's closet
we found 10 million lire cash
and a file on the Terzi drug.
Can you imagine?
She seemed so innocent.
She seduced Calabresi
to get inside the institute.
- Aren't you teetotal?
- Yes, I still am.
lf you insist, Morsella will tell you
Braun and the girl met often.
lt certainly wasn't for sex.
He's queer.
- Have you arrested him?
- Don't ask me.
Ask Morsella.
He might say that Braun hasn't been
seen since Bianca died. Morsella!
What a big mouth.
Good thing I keep an eye on him.
GERMAN SCIENTlST
SUSPECTED OF THREE MURDERS
- Signor Giordani?
- Yes.
May l come in?
l have some news
which may interest you.
l'm sorry, but I don't recall...
Don't try, we've never met.
May l?
My name wouldn't mean anything.
l read your article about Braun.
l know you're looking for him.
l can tell you where he is.
But hurry, he's about to leave.
Look, my paper isn't rich.
lt's not a question of money.
l just want him caught.
For reasons I won't trouble you with
but which you can imagine.
l prefer to avoid the police.
That's why I've come to you.
lf you hurry, you can find Braun
in a villa on the outskirts of the city.
The address is Via Rovereto 20.
Thanks.
You may despise me.
You may think l'm an informer.
What l'm doing is contemptible.
But l must take revenge.
Do you know the boy with Braun,
Manuel?
Braun stole him from me.
Manuel was with me first.
We were together for three years.
When Braun goes to prison,
l hope Manuel will come back.
lf not, I'll kill myself.
Professor Braun? Are you here?
Don't worry, I'm not with the cops.
Where's Braun? Tell me.
- Bastard, you know where.
- Damn it, has he left?
- You've never been here before?
- I asked you where Braun is.
Over there.
Another dead end.
We're back at square one.
- Do you want some help?
- My hands still work.
Besides, I like eggs done my way.
There's cheese.
We've got scandal but no killer.
- These grapes are good.
- Help yourself.
There's just one thing missing.
And that is?
The note Bianca told us about.
- The killer must have it.
- Maybe.
But Bianca was a shrewd operator.
She may have hidden it.
Her bag would be too obvious.
An olf watch with a photo
of the deaf man.
Maybe... maybe that's it.
Come on.
Help me.
Wait.
Your cane. Fancy burying the girl
with the damn locket round her neck.
Talk about taking secrets to the grave.

Pity we had to come at night.
Ever heard of daytime
grave robbers?
- Are we grave robbers now?
- What else are we?
lf someone jumps on us,
you're on your own.
l'll hang on to you.
- Damn, it's certainly quiet.
- Right. But something's here.
What?
- Did you hear that?
- Yes. Keep still.
- It may have been a cat.
- Maybe.
They say cats love graveyards.
Did you not know that?
Wait.
This is it. Here we are.
lt's padlocked.
lt shouldn't be hard to open.
- Shall I go in?
- Go on.
- Come on.
- OK, l'm going.
- If you hear anything, call me.
- Go on, hurry.
- They haven't put her away yet.
- Good.
How's it going?
l'm unscrewing.
- Can you hear anything?
- Nothing.
- It stinks.
- We're not on a mountain hike.
Found it!
Open it.
- Nothing. Only the face.
- Open the back.
- Nothing.
- It's empty.
Bring it here. Give it here.
Hurry.
Come on!
What's that?
A small spring.
Break it.
lt's here, I've found it.
What does it say?
lt's stuck together.
l'm worried I might rip it.
We'll read it later.
There. Put it back.
That's it.
Arno?
Arno, what's going on?
Open up.
For God's sake open the door.
Shit.
Giordani?
Say something.
Where are you? Don't play games.
l'm here.
Giordani.
Where are you?
Let's get out of here quick.
What happened up there?
Lori... He's got Lori.
He wanted the note.
- But you didn't give...
- I had no choice.
- It was the only evidence.
- Now we have some more.
- What would that be?
- I stabbed him. I heard him yell.
We may be in time to find Lori.
- She left a while ago.
- I said to keep her here.
- The taxi driver brought a note.
- What note?
- This one.
- Let's see.
Are we going to see Cookie?
Why don't you answer?
Tell me or I won't get in.
Will the driver
who went to Via Frentani 12
report immediately
to Piazza Duomo?
Thanks.
- Hello.
- I have the child.
I'll kill her if you tell the police.
No, I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep her for a few days.
Keep your mouths shut.
I have some business to finish.
If anything happens,
you'll get her back with her throat cut.
Arno, what's wrong?
What's wrong?
Someone who's killed four times
won't hesitate at killing a child.
Have you got friends in the police?
The wound is proof,
it's not easy to hide.
All right. I'll do it.
l'll help you.
- Remember...
- We'll do it your way. No publicity.
Morsella...
Morsella, come up.
l need to talk to you.
What's wrong?
ln there.
Well? What happened?
Lots of things.
A lot of them to do with you.
First, you're not Terzi's daughter.
- I'd have told you...
- You're more than that to him.
Yes. I'd have told you.
- Let's talk.
- We'll talk some other time.
There are more important things
to deal with.
First. the night you came to my flat,
the killer left shortly before.
- What are you saying?
- Second, you held the glass
before I threw it away
but didn't drink from it.
Maybe you knew it tasted bad.
Another coincidence,
tonight Arno stabbed the killer.
How did you hurt your hand?
You added things up
when you found out about me and Terzi?
lt got me thinking.
Stupid narrow-minded journalist.
Two and two make four.
An Italian-style equation.
Whore plus liar equals murderer.
And I thought
l'd met a civilized man.
Excuse me,
l found this broken vase upstairs.
ls it a deep cut?
Let's go. We're done here.
Everyone comes in through
the main door, except the directors.
They have their own keys
and come in by a side door.
Come on.
- Where now?
- This way.
No, I can't.
You go. l'd rather wait here.
As you wish.
Nothing here either.
Check these rooms.
Nothing here either.
- Not here either.
- We're done.
lt's no use. She's not here.
We can only inform headquarters.
Then start a full-scale search.
Do you agree?
Yes. Fine.
- Where's the phone?
- On the 5th floor.
Casoni?
They put your life at risk.
l warned them.
Giordani? Where are you?
Over there!
Stay there. Don't move.
Stay or I'll run this right through you.
- It's you?
- Leave him, Arno.
Don't come any closer or l'll kill him.
l had to do it.
l had no choice.
l found out that I had the XYY variant.
That I was predisposed to murder.
- They would have thrown me out.
- What did you do with Lori?
l replaced my file with a negative one.
No one would have known
but for Calabresi.
He tried to blackmail me.
l had to kill him.
Shut up.
l'm not interested.
Where is Lori?
- I killed her.
- Leave him. He's mad.
You'll never get her back.
l killed her.
How could you kill an innocent child
who was only eight years old?
Cookie?
Cookie!
