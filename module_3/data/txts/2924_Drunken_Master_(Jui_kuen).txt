Hey, Friend!
Your style's not bad.
But take it easy, you look beat.
You must be the Four Door Fist Champion,
Chen Kuo-Wei?
l'm Chen Kuo-Wei. And your name...
if you have one?
Sure, it's Thunderfoot.
l've heard of your devil's kick,
lt's famous in the Kung-Fu world.
lt has never been defeated...
And it never will.
l suppose l should warn you.
l've been given good money - to kill you!
Someone's paid you to kill me?
l'll pay you the double to kill him!
You could, only my honour comes first.
You must realise, the contract's sealed.
So you must die.
Don't be so sure,
For l, champion of the four Door Fists,
have never yet been defeated!
l don't care who you are, l'll
break every bone in your body...
And send you to hell!

''WONG KEl-YlNG SCHOOL''
Kai Hsien!
What's the matter, Master?
l'm going out, keep an eye on them.
Yes sir, l will sir.
Stop!
Let's practise the Five Animal Styles
which l taught you a few days ago.
He's so lame.
- Miserable!
- Pointless!
Start now.
Dragon Sees Tiger.
Tiger's rear, Snake's Tongue Darts Out.
Panther Sees Fire, White Crane
Spreads Wings.
No. Hold it, hold it.
Your wrists are too weak.
You can't learn it well, understand?
l suppose you think that was funny,
playing tricks on your teacher!
Take that!
lt wasn't me!
lf it wasn't you, who was it then?
lt was Wong Fei-Hung.
Wong Fei-Hung!
Even though Master Wong is your father,
you don't have a right
to cause trouble here.
Oh balls! You think Kung-Fu
is just a performance.
You're telling me my Kung-Fu is bad?
Not too bad, but bad enough.
Show me exactly what's wrong with it.
Right, look at your Panther Sees Fire.
Well what's wrong?
You've exposed your body.
lt's easy to attack you.
And that Horse Stance is
bow-legged. Just a kick...
and you'll fall.
What are you laughing at?
You like to test your teacher's Kung-Fu?
We can all learn from each other.
l've taken enough of this crap!
Right! Come on!
You've exposed your body again.
- See how solid my legs are?
- Damn you!
Your hat!
Why are you laughing Fatty?
Bastard!
Your'e great, Fei-Hung!
Yeah, your'e the cat's ass making
old crow-face dance like that!
He's so full of bullshit, He thinks
he's God's gift to Kung-Fu!
You really showed him!
That's great.
Eat more then!
No, l'm talking about that girl.
Wow! That perfect frame she's got.
Really sexy!
- How much?
- 30 cents.
Not bad!
lmagine being kissed by that chick.
Kissing is for childen.
l could get her to hug me.
Liar! l don't believe you.
You want to bet on it?
l'll bet you a whole dinner.
She's hot, she wouldn't
look at you twice!
All right! A whole dinner then.
Just watch.
He's looking for trouble.
- Excuse me!
- My eye hurts.
Something got into my eye. Blow it out.
Please, help me.
Harder.
He did it!
Thanks.
Snake!
Don't be afraid. l'll kill it,
don't be afraid
That's great. l must try
that on your sister.
My sister?
Thought you could take advantage
of my daughter, did you?
Me touch her? She was asking
for it, that dumb bitch.
Mother!
You wanted to lay your
filthy hands on her.
On her? That's a laugh.
She's much too ugly.
Think your'e real smart, huh?
Well, l'll teach you a lesson, boy.
So you want to play Kung-Fu? Try this!
The old bitch is tough.
Hey guys, you gonna help?
Some friends they make.
Ok, you're nothing but a skinny
old woman, so l let you win!
Watch where your'e going! Stumbling
about like a drunken stooge!
Antique jade!
Mister, want to buy?
- You sure it's real?
- Of course. lt's a family heirloom.
- How much?
- 10 dollars.
Too expensive!
lt's worth it!
Only 10 cents?
Mister, l can't sell it that cheap.
Please give it back to me. lt's all l have!
- Then l'll keep the jade and the money.
- My jade!
- You broke my jade! Pay me back!
- Pay you? No way!
Father...
You must pay me!
What happened?
He's broken my jade and
then he refused to pay me!
Shithead! Piss off!
Talking to your mother?
Rot in hell!
Hand over that man's money!
Pay? Not before l put you into the ground.
lt's too bad you feel that way,
because l'm in a bad mood.
Let me teach you how to pay.
Get up!
Wanna kill me?
Wow, this is dangerous!
You barely missed my knuckles!
This money is for you!
l'm doomed, l'm dead!
Don't be afraid, it's just the blunt end.
l don't want to kill you.
Don't move!
Mercy!
Not yet!
Got you now!
Fainted that easy?
Sometimes my attacks aren't
very accurate. Watch out!
l chop, chop, chop... the meat!
l slice, slice, slice... like a cucumber!
l beat, beat, beat... you like garlic!
l'm glad l came across you.
You sure have brightened my day!
lt's been ages, brother.
You still look great.
Your brother is old now.
What a beautiful niece l've got.
She's still a kid.
- Where's Fei-Hung?
- He went out.
This naughty boy always goes
out to play. He's a young man now.
l think you may not recognize him.
This time, stay longer.
Hung, don't go away.
Come to greet your auntie and cousin.
Come here, now.
Coming... Shit
Greet your auntie.
Auntie, cousin.
- Cousin.
- Fei-Hung.
What happened to your neck?
l... l slept without a pillow.
Without a pillow? Let me help you.
- No thanks, auntie.
- Come on, relax
Auntie!
Mother!
Feel better now?
Yes.
Brother, Fei-Hung really looks smart.
He's quite tactful and clever.
Brother, you're really a good father.
Yes, l'm very strict to him.
No wonder l heard people praising
him as soon as l came here.
Really? What did they say?
The son of Wong Kei-Ying is very smart.
He's also a man of justice.
l'm very proud of him.
Come here, my son.
Come here.
Sit down.
But there are many sex maniacs
in this village.
A bad guy harassed your niece...
on the street just now.
He attacked me too.
Who dares to do this to my relatives?
Could you recognize him?
Sure l could.
Good, let's find him now.
l'll teach him a real good
lesson. Fei-Hung, come with me.
Uncle! You don't have to go out.
- Why?
- That guy is right here.
Who?
He's your son, Wong Fei-Hung.
You...
Kneel down!
Father.
You have dishonoured me.
Wong Kei-Ying!
l'm doomed.
Mr. Li, is someone looking for a cure?
l'm looking for your son.
Why?
Your son beat my son
without any reason.
He really beat him up. He's
wrapped up like a dumpling!
Wong Kei-Ying! l want justice!
- You beast, l must kill you.
- No, Dad... No...
- Brother, you mustn't kill your own son.
- l must kill him, he's a disgrace!
Sounds bad for a teacher
of your standing.
Mr. Li didn't come to witness
how you punish your son.
lf he must be punished, l suggest
that Mr. Li here is quite capable.
What are you doing? Dont move!
l'm responsible for what l've done.
Beat me!
l will not fight back.
How dare you say something like that?
So, you think your'e funny, huh?
OK, Mr Wong, what are you going to do?
l disown him! This slime is
no longer mine!
Do what you like with him!
Mr. Li, l have a proposition.
Let Fei-hung take 10 strikes
without any resistance.
10 strikes should be enough.
Now, Mr Li, do you approve?
l don't need 10 strikes
to kill him, 3 is enough.
Master, listen. l'm going to fix that squirt.
Be sure you leave him looking
just like l look now.
The Divine Eight, that palm-style
of yours is really something.
Ha! l'm only getting started!
l'm not dead yet!
You want to cut off my posterity?
Enough!
That's your 10 strikes.
You said you would kill me within 3 strikes.
Snake and Crane together.
Strike the vital points.
Let's try your Divine Eight again.
l told you l've got style.
Hey! My jacket's getting dirty, take it!
You regret not paying
for that jade now, huh!
You've got the wrong guys.
Better be more careful!
My son, are you alright?
Master, now l look just like you.
Ok, you win with your smart tricks.
l'll get you back. Let's go!
You haven't heard the last of us.
Come on, let's get out of here.
- You watch out!
- So don't come back!
He came in with one cripple
and left with two.
You fight well, l give you that,
but l'll still kill you!
Brother.
lt's useless to beat him anymore. Let's
punish him by Kung-Fu practice.
l've tried with that bastard.
Right, from now on you stay in the house.
We'll start with five hours of Horse Stance!
Now don't move.
Have some more boiling water, bastard!
Are you comfortable?
Are your legs shaking, are they aching?
You know, l feel sorry for you.
Poor little chicken!
You feel itchy? Want me to help you?
Stop, don't do that!
l'm just carrying out
your father's orders.
He says that for every bowl you break,
you stay another hour. You bastard!
Master, you're back!
Yes, his stance appears to be
pretty steady.
- Did he slack off?
- No, l've been watching him.
Really? Finally some progress.
Yes, l'm very tired.
Are you really that tired?
But you've got a chair, right?
What? A chair? Let me see!
Damn it, a chair...
You dare cheating me while
l'm punishing you?
l really can't do anything about you.
l'll ask your uncle to come
tomorrow and fix you.
Who's he?
Beggar So.
Help me, To Tao!
Hurry!
Practising your Kung-Fu
upside down, huh?
l brought you food.
l'll go get something to drink
My neck!
Get me down, quickly.
You came down so quickly.
Hurry.
Unty me!
Take this.
- Master's asked Beggar So to fix you?
- Yes.
Poor you!
- Why?
- You don't know?
l heard he's very cruel.
All his students have become cripples.
Really?
lt's true.
Nui was his student and you
know what happened to him?
What?
He lost all his teeth and
hair. His nose got twisted.
Even his own father
couldn't recognize him.
That monster gets pleasure
out of torturing people.
What should l do then?
You think about it yourself.
You've got to help me,
l don't know what to do!
- Escape, that's the only way!
- Escape, that's the only way!
You're so clumsy.
You should try to pay more attention!
- Just go.
- l'll leave now.
''RESTAURANT YUE WO''
Sir, here are the dumplings.
Please have a seat over there.
Excuse me, do you mind if l sit here?
No, please sit down.
You're by yourself, good.
l don't like to eat alone.
The food here is very good.
Everything looks and tastes great.
Real good smell, really fantastic.
What can l get you sir?
-This is such a suprise!
Huh, what's that?
No you eat first, eat.
What would you like to eat?
A bowl of shark's fin as appetizer.
Sorry, we have no shark's fin.
lt's too bad. Then l want a
roasted goose leg. The left one.
A chicken and a steamed grouper.
Sorry, we have no grouper.
Then any fish will do.
Also a stewed abalone and
shrimp noodles. Hurry!
And half a catty of
Shaoshing wine, hurry!
You have a great appetite.
lt is necessary to eat
well to become strong!
Here's your order.
- But it's your wine.
- Drink, please.
Eat!
Eat!
We're friends... Feel free to eat...
You must be starving!
Very nice.
l mean it. The food is really good.
l'll pay the bill, don't refuse me.
l'll go and pay it now.
Buy me lunch tomorrow.
l'm leaving. l'll pay today.
Goodbye, see you tomorrow.
Take it easy, goodbye. Excuse me.
That will be exactly $1.05.
Someone else will pay the bill.
Really? Who?
The old man over there.
You know him?
He's my father.
Your father? How many
fathers do you have?
He's the boss of this inn and l'm
his son. That makes you a bastard.
Thought the meals were free here,
did you? We don't give credit
Look there.
''PAY OR DlE!''
No, l just forgot to bring the money.
l'll come back tomorrow
and pay you then.
''PAY OR DlE!''
Gorilla, beat him up!
Tiger's Claw.
Stop it, let's talk
Go ahead, beat him.
l'll get back what you've eaten.
Roasted goose's leg.
The left one.
And the fish.
Also half a catty of ShaoShing wine.
No more, l'm dying.
Hey, that's enough, or do
you want to kill the boy?
No, it's not enough. He is to
do the toilet cleaning for us.
You want something to clean, huh?
Thanks old man.
You dare to interfere with our affairs?
Just look how strong
l am. Watch me jump!
Jump then.
Now you're jumping all right!
This is how to wash your face.
Damn you!
Stop eating!
We're friends, remember?
You've got arms of iron,
but you've brains of straw.
Stop that, let's get out of here!
Old man.
You're really tough.
Of course.
How else could l survive in this world?
Just look at you.
You're weak and useless.
Today was just a bad day.
lf l hadn't fallen into the trap,
l would've beaten them.
Sounds like an excuse.
l forgot to ask why you
couldn't pay for your meal.
That's a long story.
Old man, may l know your name?
l'm Mr So.
Hey, there's a fellow with the
same name screwing up my life!
lt's all his fault!
Who are you talking about?
He's this creep named Beggar So
my father asked to train me.
So you're afraid of him?
Afraid? Of course not!
l have heard rumours.
He's very cunning, violent
and mean. But l'll show him!
That old fart. Wait until
l see him, l'll tear him apart.
You'll show the fart, huh?
Yeah, sure. Where do you come from?
The sky is my roof and
l sleep where ever l may.
- So you're a bum?
- Everyone calls me Beggar So.
Your name is Beggar So as well?
Beggar So?
That's the name.
Luckily l'm fast on my feet.
That was close.
Not fast enough!
You can't escape from me!
Your father paid me well to train you
and that's what l'm going to do!
How long will this take?
- One day?
- One year exactly.
l'll never make it!
You already have your cash,
so you can relax.
But l'm going to enjoy this!
l'll see you in hell!
Let me go! Your'e breaking my neck!
Damn you!
You're just an old beggar who likes
to pretend you're a real tiger, eh?
l'll show you what a tiger's about!
l see your tiger's got a bad paw, huh?
lt's still there!
All that Kung-Fu looks like dancing.
The Crane attacks!
Crane's Beak. Angry Crane.
Crane eats the Shrimp!
- The Crane Flies.
- How's your head?
Your fingers are stronger than my teeth!
l'm coming to get you!
You scared me.
Climbing trees to get away now, are we?
No!
l'm just using Monkey Kung-Fu.
Ready to learn?
- Answer! Answer!
- My head!
Please stop, l want to learn.
But l don't like your style of recruitment.
l don't want to die like this.
lt hurts!
l thought you were supposed
to be a teacher.
But you are trying to kill me.
All students with style
must learn how to fall.
Trying to escape?
l just wanna take a piss.
So do it there!
From the right jar to the left jar.
The back jar to the right jar.
The back jar to the front jar.
Left jar to the right jar.
Stupid old man, playing games with jars.
Continue!
This is torture.
Fei-Hung! Fei-Hung!
Have a good wash, you old bastard!
Hey you, get out of here.
Asshole, piss off. Are you deaf?
Are you blind? Can't you see l'm busy.
No hanging around you bum. Move your ass.
ls this your place?
What if l refuse to move then?
A big mouth and a wet ass.
lt should be taught some manners.
How does it feel? Nice and dry?
Right you twerp! l'll give you dry!
l'll shove you in the head first.
What's that supposed to be, Kung-Fu?
Who taught you that load of shit?
No-one calls my dad's Kung-Fu shit!
Judging by that, your old man's
Kung-Fu stinks.
l wouldn't ask him to clean my shoes.
l think you'd better call me father.
Go to hell!
Sit down!
Get up! Sit down again!
All my sons must obey.
Take my shoes.
l don't even need to use my hands.
You'd better use them, l'm not scared.
Had enough?
l'll fight to the end!
- Don't come here!
So, your hiding in your turtle shell now?
Your skull's like butter. You could study for
the rest of your life and still not beat me.
Killing a nobody like you...
would only ruin my reputation.
Crawl between my legs...
and then go home to your pig-sty!
Crawl!
Wait!
Aren't these your pants?
''What's that supposed to be, Kung-Fu?
Who taught you that load of shit?''
''l wouldn't ask him to clean my shoes.''
''Your skull's like butter.''
''You could study for the rest of
your life and still not beat me.''
''Killing a nobody like you...''
''would only ruin my reputation.''
''would only ruin my reputation.''
''Crawl between my legs, Then
go home to your pig-sty.''
You idiot, this wine is very expensive.
lt smells good.
Master, l'll dry your clothes.
Hey, why so sexy?
lt's on fire!
You burnt my best cloak!
My backbone!
- My wrists!
- Your wrists are not strong enough.
More rabbit food...
and the tea's weak & cold.
Stay quiet and eat.
Master, you're giving me a headache.
Eat!
You're so tired you can't
even use your chopsticks?
Master, l'm finished.
That was quick.
Now, use these smaller cups
to empty it again.
Go on.
l wish l'd known about this part first.
This is killing me.
Fei-Hung!
Crack this walnut for me.
No, you break it like this.
Now you try.
Please, Master! Haven't
l cracked enough?
To hell with this.
Why don't we go for a walk?
All right.
l told you, l'm very good at this.
lt's true, Master.
Place your bets.
Old man, you should leave now.
Leave?
How can l buy good wine
with so little money?
l've still got more money to win.
Hurry up!
Turn it over!
Quit shouting!
Turn it over.
You're amazing, Master. You did it again.
Put down your bets. We're getting rich.
You were lucky.
You there, old man.
l'll play a game with you.
Right, this is my lucky day.
- Go ahead, choose.
- No problem.
Turn it over.
See? it's not there. l'm sorry.
You think you're quick, huh?
Well, my eyes are quicker.
So, you're trying to cheat, huh?
Police! Police! Run!
You're a dirty thief. Give
me back my money!
You'll never get your money back!
Do you know who l am?
Who cares!
l'll tell you who l am, l'm lron-Head Rat.
l'll show you with this brick.
Very hard indeed.
Scared?
Hey, baldy!
Give me back the money!
l don't care who you are!
l warn you shitface,
l choose who l bury next!
l'll let you try my iron head!
Master, his head is too hard!
Don't give up!
Let's see you stop my iron head!
This is fun!
Good, very good.
Bet you never guessed you'd
end up in someone's pants!
An iron hammer for an iron head?
Can you take it?
That's enough, please!
Master, my wrists are breaking!
- Lazy!
- No.
My hands are gonna break!
No more exercises. Go fetch me some wine.
''RESTAURANT WAl YU''
Waiter!
Coming. What do you want?
- Some wine.
- Shall l fill it up?
No, 3 three cups will be enough.
ls that all?
Hurry up, don't just stand there.
Damn it! Where's that
stupid boy with my wine?
ldiot.
That's him!
Old man, who are you?
Who's asking?
Old man, have you heard
of the King of Sticks?
Yes, l have. Have you ever
heard of Beggar So then?
Beggar So?
ln person!
Let's go!
Don't go. He doesn't
look like Beggar So.
He's trembling, he can't be
the real Beggar So.
So you think you're being funny?
l'm not fooled that easilly.
But l'm not lying, l am Beggar So!
Give me the wine!
lt's water!
ldiot! Now see what you've done!
lf l ever meet them again,
l'll kill them both.
Cheer up, eat something.
Master, it's all my fault you were beaten.
lt seems bad luck follows you around.
l've been through a lot of things,
but until this day...
l had never been beaten.
He wasn't better than you, but
you've no strength without your wine.
You sure can talk.
True, but if l had been taught better,
l could've beaten that jerk.
You mean to say l'm not
teaching you right?
You're just pushing me around.
You're teaching me how to get beaten.
Your father is without question
an excellent martial arts Master.
His methods are among the best.
So why would he ask me
to teach you my style?
He wants you to torture me.
He asked me because he knows
l've got a secret style.
What's that?
The 8 Drunken Gods!
lt's nothing special.
That shows your damned ignorance.
Many people have asked me to teach
them but l turned them all down!
Don't be fooled by my staggering,
there's power inside to kill.
lt looks real enough, yet it isn't.
Pretending lets you win.
Clever isn't it?
Why haven't you shown me it before?
Didn't your father tell you that...
foundation is very important.
l do this because l want you to
have a good foundation.
l think you're ready now.
Really?
To study my style, you'll find it
easier if you have a drink first.
Drink up.
Have another cup.
Hung, have you ever been to school?
Yes, for a while.
Drink up the wine.
May our cups never rest.
For l'll sing you a song.
l'll put your ears to the test.
Power and wealth are no avail to us.
When only drinking prevails.
Boy, enough, enough.
Sober men and sages are
lost through the ages.
All our brave drinkers shall never die.
All our brave drinkers shall never die.
Shing Fung produces the finest of wines.
The best soldiers of Shien Yang
are always young.
Even the King couldn't stop my drinking.
Let's drink a toast to
our ship that's sinking.
With uplifted cup l say to the full moon.
Why does my shadow apear to swoon?
Wine in a radiant cup you see.
Put down that cup the horses
are awaiting thee.
Fallen on the battlefield, the
soldier says, who will remeber me?
Who will remember me?
Who will remember me...
The God Lu, the drunkard
with inner strength.
The God Li, the drunken cripple
with the powerful right leg.
The God Jun, the drunkard
holding a pot in his arms.
The God Lan, the drunkard with
the sudden deadly waist attack
The God Chan, the drunkard
with the swift double-kicks.
The God Tso, the drunkard
with the powerful throat lock
The God Han, the drunken flute
player with powerful wrists.
The God Miss Ho, the drunken
woman flaunting her body.
Come on, this is serious!
Concentrate.
lsn't this style for women?
Miss Ho is a woman, yes,
but she is strong. Watch me.
Do like l do!
Continue practising!
Okay, l will.
Practise hard.
This is for sissies. l won't do it!
Wong Kei-Ying! Why do you stop the villagers
from selling me the Bull Head Hill?
First your son beat my son.
And now you are sticking
your nose into my business.
Mr. Li, why do you want to buy the hill?
That old graveyard up there is cursed,
it has been haunting us for centuries.
lt's disturbing my familys spirits.
l have to buy it.
They'll get more than $20 per lot.
lt's good money for that land.
You should keep out of this.
So you have a problem with the spirits?
You don't believe me? l've got
three mistresses without childen.
They cannot give birth.
They can't even produce a chicken egg!
Maybe you've just become impotent.
You can't hide anything from me.
What do you mean?
Li Wan-Hao, l think you just
want what's hidden in the hill.
What would that be?
Coal!
You secretly deal with the Coal Company...
to make profit from the
selling of the coal.
You can hide your guilt before the
villagers, but you can't hide it from me.
Since you know it, l won't deny.
lf you don't interrupt my work
l'll give you 20% of my profit.
20%? You'd spend so much on me?
Listen, the hill belongs to the village.
No one can take it away, get out of here!
Wong Kei-Ying, you're
trying to go against me.
You are going to pay for this!
''$1.000 for the death of
Wong Kei-Ying of Fushan.''
Wong Kei-Ying?
''BlRTHDAY CEREMONY''
- Master.
- ls the food for tonight ready?
Yes, Master.
Hurry up, there will be many guests tonight.
Master Hsu!
Big Funeral?
You want me to beat you? Didn't you
suffer enough last time?
l just wanna have something
to eat and someone to beat.
Alright. l'll make you an
extra special dish tonight!
Master, what is it?
- Bamboo shoot and pork. Get me a stick!
- Yes.
Pork?
l'll have a piece first.
Tastes good.
