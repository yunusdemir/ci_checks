To these
poor labourers,
smoking marijuana
was a way to relax,
after a long day of
working in the fields.
But white Americans
along the border,
didn't much like these foreigners
or their strange customs.
Marijuana, it was rumoured, gave
the Mexicans super-human strength,
and turned them into
blood-thirsty murderers.
ALIEN WEED MAKES
MAN INTO KILLER
One evening in El Paso, some white
Texans where allegedly attacked,
by a Mexican that went
crazy on the killer weed.
Moving swiftly the El Paso city council
passed a law banning possesion of marijuana.
Supposedly designed
to control marijuana,
they law quickly became a way
for the city to control Mexicans.

Unlike the people of El Paso,
most Americans had never
even heard of marijuana.
They were more concerned
about the rising addiction,
to opium, morphine, cocaine and heroin,
which were all serious public health issues.
But instead of treating drug addiction
as a public health problem,
TREASURY DEPARTMENT
Washington, D.C. circa 1930
the federal government put control of these
drugs in the hands of the Treasury Department,
who created the Federal
Bureau of Narcotics.
- Rolling!
HARRY J. ANSLINGER
Comissioner
Federal Beaury of Narcotics
- This is Harry J. Anslinger, commisioner
of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.
- Sorry...
- The Treasury Department intends
to pursuit a relentless warfare,
- against the despicable dope-peddling vulture
who prays on the weakness of his fellow man,
- Hold!
Americas first drug czar
was Harry J. Anslinger.
A law and order evangelist, Anslinger
would shape Americas attitude,
toward marijuana for
generations to come.
FAMILY • TEMPERANCE • PLEDGE
GOD BLESS OUR HOME
Like many americans, Anslinger
was a prohibitionist.
These morally correct citizens,
sincerely felt that progress
could only be achieved,
by controlling the depraved
impulses of the masses.
- Swordfish.
He believed that if the laws where tough
enough, America could be rid of alcohol.
Put enough people in jail,
and eventually the public
will learn to behave.
And he applied this same philosophy
on mounting the government's war on drugs.
Special treasury agent are
part of a massive force,

created solely to control
the traffic in narcotics.

- No.
- Get out of the car and
let's take a look at it.
- Come on.
Move over, J. Edgar Hoover,
here come the agents of the
Federal Beaury of Narcotics!
Like J. Edgar Hoover,
Anslinger posed for the cameras,
creating the impression he was smashing
one major dope ring after another.
But he found it pretty quickly
that policing 48 states,
on a depression-strapped
budget was impossible.
His solution was to try to convince the
states to police local drug traffic themselves.
Campaigning tirelessly he *** each
state to sign a join agreement,
to commit state resources
to fighting drugs.
But only nine
states signed on.
The other 39 wieved it as federal
interferance in their affairs.
It was a major defeat for
the young drug commisioner,
but he wasn't the
type to give up.
NEW ORLEANS, LOUSIANA circa 1919
Meanwhile marijuana, carried
by west indian sailors,
arrived in port cities
like New Orleans.
Knowns as 'muggles',
'tea', or 'reefer',
it was popular with the jazz crowd
because it made music sound so good.
From here, musicians carried
it up the Mississippi,
to urban centers in the North.

<i>Wrap your ***

<i>Blow this hay

Determined to get the act passed,
Anslinger unleashed a media campaign
to make the public believe,
that this little known plant growing
at the side of little roads,
was the biggest threat
America had ever faced.

The propaganda campaign was successful

CAPITOL HILL
Washington D.C. circa 1937
- Gentlemen, take your seats.
But now, frightened out of their
minds, the american public,
demanded that the federal government
assed new laws to fight marijuana.
Terrified voters wanted action,
and their government responded.
Without any public debate, scientific
inquiry or political objection,
the Marijauana Tax Act was signed
into law by President Roosevelt.
JUNE 14, 1937
The act prohibited possession of
marijuana anywhere in the United States,
without a special tax stamp
from the Treasury Tepartment,
and the Treasury Department
didn't give out any stamps,
effectively making marijuana illegal.
Over night a new class
of criminals was created.

The first person to be convicted
was Samuel R. Caldwell,
a 58 year old Denver man,
sentencing him to four years
hard labour at Leavenworth,
judge J. Foster Syme said:
"I consider marijuana the
worst of all narcotics."
"Under it's influence,
men become beasts."
"In the future, I will impose
the heaviest penalties."
"The government is going to enforce
this new law to the letter."
NEW YORK CITY circa 1937
- Prohibition cannot
be enforced,
- for the simple reason that the majority of
American people do not want it enforced,
FIORELLO LA GUARDIA
Mayor of New York
- and are resisting
it's enforcement.
- That being so,
the orderly thing to do,
- under our form
of government,
- is to abolish a law
which cannot be enforced,
- a law which the people of the
country do not want enforced!
New Yorks prohibition fighting
mayor, Fiorello La Guardia,
was somewhat sceptical of
the government's claims,
that marijuana was causing murder,
rape, and destruction of Americas youth.
Wanting to get the facts,
he commisioned a study,
by a group of 31
impartial scientists.
After six years of medical and
sociological research,
the La Guardia
commision found:
Smoking marijuana did not lead to
violent or anti-social behaviour;
Smoking marijuana did not cause
uncontrollable sexual urges;
Smoking marijuana did not alter a
persons basic personality structure.
Item by item, the commision's report disproved,
every negative effect
claimed by Harry Anslinger.
THE MARIJUANA PROBLEM
IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK
Furious, Anslinger used
his influence with the press,
to have the
report discredited,
and destroyed every copy
he could get his hands on.
And by restricting the
supply of marijuana,
he put a stop to any
further research.
Not taking any chances,
Anslinger ordered his men
to dig up dirt on anyone,
who disagreed with him,
and going on the offensive, he targeted
the entertainment industry,
which he saw as a degenerate
moral influence.

Heroin Addict!
Youth is a time for fun,
pranks and jokes,
"DRUG ADDICTION" (1951)
of ice cream cones
and chocolate sodas.
Youth is a time
for getting a job,
for finding one's
place in the world.
But sometimes, in
these troubled days,
the very thoughtlessness of youth
has led to a living nightmare:
Addiction to drugs.
- What's that?
- H.
- H? What's H?
- Shhh! Not so loud.
- It's heroin.
- Will it make me sick like the reefers did?
Marty's story is like
many of the others.
It started with
marijuana cigarettes.
- Come on, it's my turn next!
- Gee Duke, where did you get them?
- I... I know a guy.
- Three for a buck.
- Let me try.
He was determined to be one
of the gang, if it killed him.
And it almost did.
Several weeks later,
after smoking reefers,
Marty's befogged brain hit on a
clever way to open pop bottles.
Later Stan went to the hospital,
for swallowing broken glass.
Marty badly cut the inside of his mouth,
though he didn't even know it at the time.
Before long Marty
was hooked,
physically dependant on heroin.
Nothing mattered but the ever-
present craving for the drugs.
He had given up interest
in everything else.
<i>I get no kick
from champagne</i>
But the early 1950's,
concerned about marijuana,
was overshadowed
by a new media scare:
Rising heroin addiction
among teenagers who,
were drifting into crime
to support their habit.
"MY SON IS A
HEROIN ADDICT!"
TEEN JUNKIES

- I wan't some
money old Sam.
- You're... you're crazy.
- The money!
- I know you. They put you in jail.
- Just get the money!
- No, no!
- Please, no!
This heroin scare gave
the aging Anslinger,
a new way to attack
marijuana and respond,
to anyone who might
doubt it's terrible danger.
Smoking marijuana,
he declared,
was a direct stepping
stone to heroin addiction.

- Well yes. Most of these
addicts are very sick,
- and they are a menace
and have to be arrested.
- I get a lot of self satisfaction
arresting those people.
- And what about teenage addiction,
how does that come about usually?
- They start out by using marijuana.
- And the most marijuana users,

- Yes.
- What kind of changes could be made
to improve the narcotics situation,
- based on present

- Well Paul, the addict

SENATE CRIME HEARINGS 1951
- And your position and occupation?
- Federal Commisioner of Narcotics.
Appearing at the
Kefauver crime hearings,
Anslinger backed Senator
Hale Boggs proposal,
to increase penalties
for all drug offences.
Tougher penalties were needed he said,
because behind every narcotics peddler,
there was a communist, preparing
to overthrow our government.
COMMUNIST CHINA'S ROLE IN THE
INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFIC
- According to all the documents
that we have been examining,
- today, the major
source is red China,
- And do you see a marked
increase in the amount of drugs,
- circulating this country which you believe come
from red China since China went communist in 1949?
- Oh, very much so.
- I think, under the nationalists they had
the situation pretty well under control.
- There were about a thousand
executions a year,
- under the nationalist
Chinese government,
- I haven't heard of anyone being
wounded under this regime.
Even though there was absolutely no proof
of a communist plot to dope up America,
the country was in the
grip of cold war hysteria,
and no politician could afford
to look soft on communism.
Taking Anslingers advice, President
Truman signed the Boggs Act,
which dramatically increased
penalties for possession,
and ordered mandatory
minimum sentences.

In addition, a number of states
added their own penalties.

UNITED NATIONS
New York circa 1961
Setting his sights higher,
Anslinger went to the UN,
and used Americas influence to
pursuade over 100 countries,
to consolidate their various drug agreements
into a single, inflexible convention,
outlawing marijuana
around the world.
This was the ultimate achievement
in Anslinger's relentless crusade,
to criminalize
marijuana use.

which he felt would be nothing less than an
assault on the foundations of western civilization.

- Oh no...
- I go for months and months
without smoking it,
- and then I'll smoke a

- Well the argument is made that pot leads
to the addiction to heroin or other narcotics.
- Have you found this to be so
among the people you know?
- No, not at all.
- The people who use the stronger
drugs, the opiates etcetera,

who smoke marijuana,
- the people who smoke marijuana
do not use the other drugs.

NIXON CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL (1968)
It is time for an honest look at the
problem of order in the United States.
So I pledge to you, we shall
have order in the United States.
ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA 1968
Manipulating the fears of what
he termed the silent majority,
Richard Nixon build his
campaign for the precedency,
around an emotionally
charged central issue:
Restoring law
and order,
and it worked.
As president, Nixon was
determined to be seen,
as the toughest
crime fighter ever.
But most crimes fell
under state jurisdiction,
so Nixon wasn't allowed
to get involved.
However there was one area where
the federal government did have power:
Drug crime.
Early in his first term,
Nixon launched Operation Intercept,
a military style excercise,
officially described as the
country's largest peace time,
search and
seizure operation.
In it, 2000 customs agents were
deployed along the Mexican border.
Their orders?
Stop the marijuana.
- This is the biggest misstake the
government of the United States has made,
- and the biggest offence they could
have done to the mexican people.
- I think it's excellent,
- I think if it stops the marijuana
flow in Los Angeles,
- and the southern cities I think it's excellent,
if it doesn't, then I think our time is wasted.
Although more than five million
American and Mexican citizens,
passed through this dragnet,
practically no marijuana was intercepted.
After three weeks, Operation
Intercept was abandoned.
I have a couple of burritos, Over.
Have you brought the hot sauce? Over.
Yes, it is very tasty. Over.
Okay. Let's have a picnic.
I will see you at the picnic site.
Now, even more determined
to appear tough on crime,
Nixon poured federal money into
equipping, training and educating,
local police forces
across America.
In the day-to-day conduct
of your police duties,
no matter how or for what reason you're
called to investigate a situation in a residence,
POLICE TRAINING FILM (circa 1969)
use your eyes to detect
evidence of marijuana,
hashish, or
narcotic violation.
The evidence you're looking
for is here alright.
But it has to be located
before you can read it.
Use your eyes.
Ashtrays are logical places
to use your eyes,
for evidence of
marijuana violations.
There are some noticeable differences
between a marijuana or grass joint,
and the butt of an
ordinary cigarette,
fairly visible even at distance
to those you use their eyes.
This of course is
marijuana itself,
the best
evidence of all.
It has distinctive characteristics.
Learn them. Use your eyes.
It also has the
distinctive aroma,
so use your nose
aswell as your eyes.
- Police officer,
open the door!
- Inside, inside,
come on...
- Look right here.
As arrests skyrocketed, the convictions
were no longer limited to minorities,
now most of the
people serving time,
were white, middle-
class American kids.
- Why do you
smoke marijuana?
- It's really
very simple.
- I smoke it because
I enjoy it.
- It doesn't worries you that
you're breaking the law?
- Sure it worries me!
- I mean it worries me because
I don't wanna get caught,
- I do not want to go to jail,
- for something that
I consider a pleasure,
- and harmless, to both
society and to myself.
- I'm not hurting anybody,
I'm not hurting myself.
- Why should I be
punished for it?
<i>And you may see me tonight
with an illegal smile,</i>
<i>It don't cost very much
but it'll last a long while,</i>
<i>Won't you please tell the man
I didn't kill anyone,</i>
<i>No I'm just tryin'
to have me some fun.</i>
When Don Crowe was
convicted of selling marijuana,
to undercover agent
there seemed reason for hope.
It was his first offence after all,
and the amount had been small,
less than one ounce.
But the jury saw it's duty.
Sentence?
50 years in prison.
For Crowe, 25 years old, newly
returned from Vietnam,
it was a bitter pill.
- I had the feeling that I was fighting
for my country, and for my fellow men.
- And it is kind of depressing to know that
I should come back and be given 50 years,
- for allegedly selling
some marijuana.
- This is a purple heart that he recieved
the first time he was wounded.
There is a mother's
pride as Ms. Crowl,
recounts Don's military record.
But it is
hard for her,
"He loved his country", she says.
"He was a good boy."
- Well we were naturally
so proud of him,
- when he was over there,
- and when he came back
and all this happened,
- of course I've just been heartbroken
and I think it is a little severe penalty.
POTpourri:
Many Views of Marijuana
- I don't think that a kid should have
their entire future career blinded,
- by having an arrest record for being
caught in a room where marijuana was kept,
- or of smoking a joint of marijuana when
they're a kid in college or a young kid,
- and that's exactly what happens,
- Everyone here seems
to emphasize the kids,
- How can you communicate with them
when they got flowers on their ears,
- so they can't hear and hair
down to their hip pockets,
- A young person, other
minority group members,
- have a much greater chance of
being arrested and are arrested,
- and if this continues, we're going to
decimate the youthfull population of America.
- That's exactly what's
going to happen.
- If anyone of us has
a kid who's arrested,
- it's going to be an arrest for narcotic
violation in his record for the rest of his life.
- He can't go in the peace corps, he
can't teach school, he can't be a cop,
- What's the difference if he commited
murder he'd have an arrest record?
- Fine if he commited murder
he's harmed someone!
- Can any law be effective, especially
a law dealing with marijuana,
- when there is so much controversy
from so many eminent-
- No law can be effective that actually, that
tries to regulate or legislate private morality.
- You can't make homosexual
laws effective, you cant make,
- could you pass a law that
says it's a crime to masturbate?
- You couldn't enforce it!
- There's laws in the book that says "thou shalt not fornicate"
either, and you wouldn't go around arresting kids for fornicating,
- *** law I would.
- Don't you even know it's against the law? You're a hell of a cop!
- It is against the law a matter of fact... sex is illegal in most of America,
- Everything is illegal in America.
- *** illegal *** it's that simple.
- I think we've come to somewhat
of a conclusion here,
- in that the law is not very effective.
- No it's not, how can it be effective,
- when you have 10 thousand kids in one
city are being arrested in one year,
- the law is
not effective.
As middle class parents
began asking,
MARIHUANA: Time to Change The Law?
"Why is my kid in jail?"
MARIHUANA: Time to Change The Law?
More and more americans began to
feel that the problem was not marijuana,
MARIHUANA: Time to Change The Law?
but marijuana laws.

Support for reform of marijuana law
seemed to come from everywhere.
Even federal officals agreed that
harsh penalties were not working.
SENATE HEARING ON MARIJUANA LEGISLATION 1969
- A conservative estimate
of persons in the United States,
SENATE HEARING ON MARIJUANA LEGISLATION 1969
- both juvenile and adults who have
used marijuana at least once,
DR. STANLEY YOLLES
Director, National Insitute of Mental Health
- is about 8 million and may
go as high as 12 million.
DR. STANLEY YOLLES
Director, National Insitute of Mental Health
- Can you imagine what would
happen to the law enforcement,
- and correction system
of this country,
- if each of these 12 million people had been caught
by a policeman when smoking his first marijuana cigarette.
- The first place in which legal
reforms can be made,
- is in the removal of mandatory minimum
penalties in all cases of drug abuse.
Sensing the public's mood,
Congress passed the
Controlled Substances Act,
which eliminated mandatory
minimum sentences,
and reduced penalties
for possession.

"DRAGNET" (circa 1970)
- Any questions?
- But I maintain the evidence
against marijuana isn't in yet.
- Well sir, will you conceive that it
might be as harmful as alcohol.
- Alright, but it's no worse.
- No sir, I hope not.
- Beacuse according to
US government figures,
- between 5 and 6 million people in this country are physically
and mentally sick as a result of their use of alcohol.
- If marijuana possesses only
half the potential of alcohol,
- for violence, criminality,
- accidents and social degradation...
- Do we need pot?
Unwilling to let a bunch
of *** liberals to,
ruin his crime
fighting agenda,
Nixon enlisted TV-producers
and showbusiness stars,
to send a strong
moral message,
"to every home, every school
and every church in America."
I've done a study
of drug abuse,
and I'm at the middle
of the whole thing,
where I can do the most good.

people know about marijuana.
Today research scientists are
studying it's effects on the brain,
the nervous system, chromosomes,
various organs of the body,
maybe it will turn out there
is no reason for it to be illegal.
But nobody can be sure
until all the facts are in.
And until they are,
it's a pretty bum risk.
Repelled by the idea
of softening any laws,
Nixon maintain that until more was
known about marijuana's dangers,
the law should not change. To this end
he made millions of dollars availible,
to find those dangers.
POT SMOKERS BEWARE

Scientists report bizarre side effects:
MEN GROW BREASTS!
- Many of us are concerned
that a large percentage,
- of our young people are breaking
the law by smoking marijuana.
- As you know here on White House
conferance youth voted to legalize marijuana,
- I know you thought about
this problem and I wonder,
- if you could give us some of your thoughts on it.
- As you know,
- there is a commission that is supposed to make
recomendations to me about this subject,
- The recommendation of the
Commission in it's first report,
RAYMOND P. SHAFER
Chairman, National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse
- is that we do not
feel that private use,
- or private possession
in one's own home,
- should have the stigma
of criminalization,
- that people who experiment,
- should not be criminalized for
that particular behaviour.
The presidential commisions
report on marijuana found,
marijuana use in and of itself,
did not cause crime.
Current laws against grass
led to selective prosecution,
and the police were suspected of
using these laws to arrest people,
with objectionable hairstyles,
skin colour, or politics.
The enormous cost of trying to
enforce laws against marijuana,
overwhelmingly outweighed any
deterrent value of these laws.
The commission had conducted the
most comprehensive highly publicized,
study of marijuana,
ever done.
THE OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE NATIONAL
COMMISSION OF MARIHUANA AND DRUG ABUSE
Furious, Nixon tossed it in the waste
basket, without ever reading it.
- Mr. President?
- Okay...
- Whenever you're ready.
- I shall continue to oppose
efforts to legalize marijuana.
Doing the exact opposite
of what was recommended,
Nixon declared an
all-out war on drugs.
His primary weapon, the DEA.
A new government agency,
that combined all of the government's
existing anti-drug agencies,
into a single, all-powerful
super-agency.
- You should keep
going forward until...
- until you're right there...
- Looks like you're right on top of it.
- Is that all there is?
- Yes.
- The last week we pulled 13 pounds of it from about 5
different patches and we got another 4 or 5 now,
- that are really small patches but we are
gonna go get in and pull them out today.
- What do you do with the, so you just come
in and destroy the patches, that the idea?
- We destroy the patch and
then we'll take it and burn it.
- Apparently there is somebody coming
back here and cultivating this?
- Definitely.
- These are all in nice little neat rows,
- it's kind of rotating crop,
some are smaller than others.
- How good is Georgia pot?
- I've never smoked it,
so I don't know.
<i>One toke over the line

- Until recently the use of marijuana
was considered a youth phenomena,
- a thing of campus protest,
the counter-culture, longhair.
- Well, not so in the 70's.
- Meet some of the
"criminals" at large.
- I've spent a lot of time with
my daughter and her friends,
<i>and they all smoked marijuana,
and so I had to try it!

- I first used pot back in
the latter part of 1968,
- and used it since then with
some degree of regularity.
- I had some pot earlier today
before I went down to court.
- I smoke at home, smoke
at parties, many places.
- To me it's a question of
the rights to life, liberty,
- and the pursuit of happiness.

You over there, come here!
As smoking marijuana became
increasingly mainstream,
pro pot activists began organizing
support for decriminilization.
- Last year in this country, there were
226.000 marijuana related arrests,
- and although the police sometimes tell us that they're
only interested in the pusher, the seller, as they say,
KEITH STROUP
Founder, National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
- the fact is that only 7% of those
arrests were against the seller.
- 93% of those arrests were
for possession and use.
- Now what that means is that there
were about 200.000 young people,
- in this country last year, who were
given an unnessecary criminal record,
- and all that involved for
the rest of their life,
- simply because they smoked grass, something
which is a relatively harmless thing to do.
- So we're not trying to encourage the use of
the drug, in fact we're trying to discourage it.
- But we're trying to get the country to understand that
there are other means to discourage the use of drugs,
- other than a criminal law,
and in this case,
- the use of the criminal law causes
more harm than the drug itself.
A political activist named John Sinclair
became a symbol for the movement.
He recieved a jail
sentence of "10 for 2",
10 years in prison for
possession of 2 joints.
- This song I wrote
for John Sinclair.
John Lennon and Yoko Ono in
"TEN FOR TWO" (1972)
<i>It ain't fair,

<i>In the stair

<i>Won't you care

<i>Takin' it to

Consistent with the changing times,
the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan,
passed an ordinance taking marijuana
possession out of the criminal code.
and making it a minor offence,
the equivalent of a parking ticket.

No more need for runnin',</i>

A year later, after a groundbreaking
vote in it's legislature,
Oregon became the first state to
completely decriminilize marijuana.
- Here is a state that is not
afraid to plow new ground,
- in an area where
there's a lot of hysteria.
- It's not gonna be very
widely understood,
TOM McCALL
Governor of Oregon
- but I think as you look back
over the handling of drugs,

- if you can keep it in for a few years,
you'll see it was landmark legislation.

In 1974, with legal problems of his own,
Richard Nixon resigned from the precidency.
<i>Legalize it,
LEGALIZE MARIJUANA</i>
<i>Don't critizise it,
- We smoke pot!</i>
- We smoke pot!
- We smoke pot!
<i>Legalize it,
Yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>And I will
advertise it,</i>
- We don't want any peddling
for the private possession,
- and use, and cultivation
of marijuana.
<i>Legalize it...</i>
A study in Oregon 4 years
after decriminalization,
showed no increase
in marijuana use,
and a substancial savings
of tax dollars,
formerly spent on
law enforcement.
By that time, 10 other states
had decriminalized marijuana.
Continuing Nixon's
war on drugs,
fill-in president
Gerald Ford ordered,
US forces to spray
Mexican marijuana fields,
with the military
defoliant Paraquat.
But in the upcoming presidential election, he found
himself running against an unexpected opponent.
- Appreciate your vote.

- leaving the states

Doing part to advocacy by the

In the permissive 70's, marijuana
seemed to be everywhere,
through movies and television, it
had entered the popular culture.
- The FBI claims that a huge shipment of
grass which they are calling "Killer Dope",
- has been smuggled into New York City.
"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" (circa 1978)
- The bureau urges, users not to smoke
the weed, which is greenish-brown in color,
- not particularly seedy, and
contains mostly cannabis buds.
- Warning symptoms are a mild euphoria
a slight rise in the pulse rate,
- some hallucination and death by
laughter within 15 minutes of ingestion.
- In an effort to aid the FBI in it's
investigation, Weekend Update,
- is undertaking it's own analysis of marijuana sent to
us anonymously by any viewers who may be worried.
- Simply place a small sample of the
suspected cannabis in an envelope,
- and send it immediately to:
Chevy Chase,
<i>apartment 12, 827 West

Dr. Peter Bourne,

was cought up in a scandal

His proposal to decriminalize
