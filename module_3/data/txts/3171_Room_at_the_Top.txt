Town Hall please.
Very good, sir.
Yes, sir.
My name is Lampton, Joe Lampton.
Oh, yes, you're coming to work here,
aren't you ?
One moment please.
I'm so sorry, sir. What were you saying?
You were just going to make an appointment...
Mr. Hoylake will see you right away.
My name is Jones...
Thanks very much.
Come in.
Didn't expect you till Monday.
Sit down.
We are not accustomed to such an excess of zeal.
But it's not exactly that, Mr. Hoylake...
I'm not surprised that you wanted to leave
Dufton as soon as possible.
You'll find big differences here, you know.
Not only work,
You'll meet a different class of people.
We pride ourselves on being civilized here in Warnley.
Dufton is not much of a place but...
we're not exactly savages there,
you know, Mr. Hoylake.
You think not?
Well, what did you come to see me about?
Well, I thought perhaps...
you see, I have to get fixed up in digs ...
You shouldn't have any difficulty.
Soames.
Yes, sir?
You might come in.
Right, Mr. Hoylake.
You'll be working with Soames,
internal audits.
He's got dig somewhere near Top.
Top's the fashionable district.
He's very comfortable, I believe.
Come in.
Charles Soames, Joe Lampton.
Lampton is the new man.
How do you do?
How do you do?
He hasn't got anywhere to live.
Can you help him?
I think so.
I'll leave it to you then.
We'll have a longer session later on.
I'll keep an hour on Monday morning for you.
This is it. And that's your desk.
Well, he didn't keep you long in the firing line.
Joe, this is Miss Samson, better known as June.
Joe Lampton, greatest addition to Treasuries Department
chain gang.
I think I'm going to enjoy my sentence.
I don't mind you enjoying it, but you don't have
to smack your lips so vigorously.
Hot tip Charles, dog in 2nd race tonight, interested?
No, but hold on a minute.
Meet new boy, Joe Lampton, Teddy Merrick.
God may help you. I got to run.
Well, Charles, how about those reports?
Those Stanton reports. Now, where did I put them?
Somewhere around here.
Have you tried looking under your skirt?
What do you mean?
You're sitting on them, love.
Oh, the sort of thing I have to put up with.
Be seeing you.
She belong to us?
Where did you get that proprietorial plural?
I meant the Treasuries Department.
No, she's Health typist.
We have our own talents.
Now, digs.
Mabel, would you get me an outside line.
No, dear, it's not a personal call.
Look, Mabel, I don't wanna argue with you.
Just get me an outside line
or I'll put a tuppence in your moral little slot
next time I'm passing.
Constipated bitch, you'd think she had shares
in corporation.
Warnley  4-3-1-5
It's not for you, lad.
But I can look, can't I ?
Not at that you can't. There is no law against
undressing women in streets.
Hello, is that you, Mrs. Thompson?
Charles Soames here. I was wondering
if I might bring a Mr. Lampton to see you?
Yes, we'll be at the house long before that.
Thank you, Mrs. Thompson.
That's as good as fixed,
and one of the best digs in Warnley, too.
Is that what you really want ?
A clerk's dream?
A girl with a Riviera tan and a Lagonda?
That's what I'm going to have.
Come on, let's go.
Nobody ever goes to Dufton.
They just pass through it.
A Sunday treat of fish and chips,
wrapped in a greasy "News Of The World".
And for chaps like me, prospects
as appetizing as yesterday's fish paste sandwich.
You know, when I was a POW...
at least there was a limit
to the time that you served.
But Dufton...
it seemed like a lifetime sentence.
You shouldn't be so nostalgic on your first day
away from the home fires, you know.
I was looking at your river,
kids fishing and swimming in it.
in Dufton the canal's like a sewer.
Kids never had the chance to fish or swim.
And the people...
well I suppose they never had the chance either.
And somehow here...
it's so different.
You wouldn't believe it, Charles.
But you made Warnley sound so special, Joe,
so very special.
It is special. It's not Dufton.
Not everybody admires the view from here.
Look, Joe...
there's the Top, that's where the money is.
Lots of lovely houses up there, you know, Joe.
I'll have one of those.
I'm going to have the lot.
No you're not!
Not in local government you're not.
Did you ever work it out brother?
In 20 years' time you could be sitting in Hoylake's chair,
and that's as high as you can go.
and that means a 1.000£ a year, a semi-detached downtown,
a 2nd hand Austin,
and a wife to match, if you know what I mean.
I know damn well what you mean.
That's why I'm going to have the lot.
Oh, no, no..
Oh, by the way.
What you do for entertainment around here?
Well, there are the flicks, of course.
Teddy Merrick and I play snooker on Friday nights.
Do you play?
Badly.
Oh, and then we have an
amateur dramatic society, "The Thespians".
Are you interested in theater?
Yes.
Look, it's only 2 weeks away.
And Charley Soames here being a part among "The Thespians"
will probably still get you a ticket for opening night.
<i>And then he went back to bed.</i>
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>In his own bed?</i>
<i>Val, what's wrong with you?</i>
<i>Did you really think I wouldn't know the minute
I saw you two together?</i>
<i>There's nothing to know.</i>
<i>I have no idea what you're talking about.</i>
<i>You're all upset.</i>
<i> I certainly am upset.</i>
Who is she?
You should have seen her in the "Playground".
Sex, terrific.
Alice Aisgill. She's French.
That's her husband, lucky devil,
sitting at the end of the front row.
<i> Val, Let's stop this.</i>
<i>I'll stop it when I get the truth.</i>
<i>Till then I refuse to go to the court room.</i>
<i>You can't do that to him.</i>
But she's not married, she couldn't be.
He means Susan.
Oh, Susan Brown.
Yeah.
She's the daughter of old millionaire Brown.
He owns most of Warnley.
Have a chew too.
Thanks.
Joe, don't waste your time.
Susan's out of your reach.
Way up in the top drawer.
She speaks as if she has a couple of hot potatoes in her mouth.
As if her finishing school hadn't quite finished with her.
Hello June. Hello, Teddy,
Don't you think she was super?
I don't know what you're talking about
but I thought she was super, didn't you, Joe?
This is Joe Lampton.
Didn't you think she was a absolutely super, Joe?
Oh, absolutely super.
I thought they were all absolutely super.
Well, my children, what was it like out front?
Where's June?
There she is talking to Bernard, the foolish virgin.
What do you think of it out there, Joe?
Well, it wasn't bad.
Oh, damn him, damning us with that same phrase.
Come meet some of the company.
I want you to meet Alice Aisgill, our leading lady.
Alice, this is Joe Lampton.
How do you do?
How do you do?
You're new here, aren't you?
Yes, I've only been here for a couple of weeks.
He's in our department.
It's Susan Joe wants to meet.
He has a thing for Susan.
Hey Bernard, come meet Bernard. Our producer.
Bernard, this is Joe Lampton.
Hello, June.
How do you do?
What do you think of Charles' dawn effect, June?
It was like thunder.
That's the trouble with these literal minds.
The playwright's instructions said crack of dawn.
That's exactly what we got.
It was a damn good dawn, you both know it.
Says you.
Come on, Joe.
Hello, Charles.
Hello.
Was I terrible?
You were very good as a matter of fact.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Joe Lampton, Susan Brown.
He liked the show very much.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Where's Jack?
Oh, he went to fetch his car.
Oh, Charles, you know that scene, the love scene?
I tried to remember what Bernard said.
Do you think I did any better?
You were fine.
Hey, Jenny, you don't need to take that home, you know.
We will need it again tomorrow night.
Why don't you leave it to Tilly?
If I'd only known...
If you'd known what?
If I'd known you were be so beautiful,
I'd have brought you some flowers.
There you are, Jack.
Here I am.
You comin' for a drink, darling?
Oh, we haven't been properly introduced, have we?
I'm Eva, Eva Kent, and you're Joe, aren't you?
We're going up to the Clarence.
Are you coming?
Oh, I'd love to but Jack and I have to go home
for dinner.
Oh, what a pity.
Cyril !
Joe this is Cyril.
He's my husband, believe it or not.
Cyril, this is Joe.
Hello.
Hello again.
Teddy was telling me about you, Teddy Merrick.
I hope you gonna like it here.
I know I am.
You don't beat about the bush, do you?
I should look out if I were you, Jack. I think you'll find
you have a rival for Susan's lovely hand.
Joe, this is Jack Wales.
Jack this is Joe something from the treasuries.
Lampton, Joe Lampton.
You two ought to have a lot in common
both being intrepid birdmen.
Oh, that. What outfit?
Wellington's.
Hmm, sergeant observer, eh?
Yes, how did you know?
Oh, I can tell.
Did you ever get beyond Wellington's?
No, as a matter of fact I was shot down early.
Spent most of the war in a prison camp.
Is that so?
Must have been rough.
Well ... as a matter of fact...
Come on Sue. 22:40 precisely.
Operation Supper to begin.
What a stinker. I don't know how you all stand it.
Come on, Sue.
Do come and have a drink with us first.
We'd love to but you know Papa Brown.
He likes you on the dot. Some other time.
Good night, all.
Good night, sergeant.
You must tell me about your POW experiences,
but some other time.
I'll remember the flowers next time.
Good night. Sir !
Frigging officer.
Jack Wales was a POW too.
He escaped.
Are you ready, darling?
Hello, Sergeant.
Shopping for lingerie?
What size are you? 44?
Listen, do me a favor, will you?
I know all about you now.
I know you were a squadron leader
with a distinguished war record,
the DSO and all the rest of it.
But just do me a favor.
The war is over, stop calling me sergeant!
I'll try to remember.
But sergeant you're selling me short.
didn't anyone told you about my DFC?
They just stood there, watching this one,
gloating over him like a bloody watch dog.
All phony acts and putting on
a squadron leader act with me.
Even threw the DFC at me.
If we've done whatever it was he did
we would have only got a DFM.
Just medals, no crosses for us.
Different brands of courage, don't you know.
Oh, there's Charlie Sales, I'll see what he's on.
Here, isn't that Susan's father's works?
Joe, you're wasting your time.
These two families, the Browns and the Wales's,
they've as much brass as the rest of Warnley rolled together.
Hey, what you think of that one?
Hmm, not bad... but not grade one.
What you mean by that?
Time I filled you in on the Lampton report on love.
I 've got a full proof method for grading women.
Partly money, partly background
and partly J. Lampton's instincts.
Now take Susan Brown.
Are you offering her to me?
No, seriously. Susan is grade one on every count.
You just have to look at her to know.
Susan is not for you, lad.
It just so happens that I like her.
You lust after her, you mean.
No, no. It's not that at all.
Well, it's partly that but not just that.
You see, she's so wholesome.
And you think you'd find her wholesome
if her old man didn't have a million in the bank?
There are plenty of other wholesome girls in Warnley,
you know.
Like who? Like June?
Yes, like June.
Say, have you got you some kind of understanding
with her?
Me? Lord, no!
June's a good kid but she's got an invalid mother.
And they live off June's salary, the pair of them.
So whoever marries June marries her invalid mother too.
What you and me should be looking for
is a nice girl with no ties
and a nice family business in background.
Shopping.
Joe, 2, track 2. We got 4 to 1. What are you on?
Grade one. I put my 2 bob on grade one every time.
Two to number 2 to win, please.
How about that baby?
That one, she's grade 10.
Grades 9 and over only mean ballrooms Saturday nights
and you wanna keep miles away from them.
All on 4 to win, please.
Now, grades one, like my girl...
they're really something special in bed. You see,
they've almost nothing else to do.
1 to win please.
Come on Joe, there's the bell.
That Brown he must coin it, you know.
All those chimneys, that's money.
Beautiful, beautiful brass.
Belching out every minute of the day and night.
Come on.
You know, Charles, I've been thinking.
About that dramatic club...
You remember you said you needed men,
fresh blood and all that?
Did you mean it?
I certainly did.
Well I don't know if I'm really good, mind.
But I'd like to try.
Oh, I get it. You're not interested in dramatics.
It's Susan.
Oh, I know. "You're wasting your time, Joe."
But do you wanna bet on it?
Did I hear somebody say bet ?
I'll bet you'll never even get a length
of a date with her.
A dollar on it then.
Right then. Cut it.
Hello, Susan.
Hello.
You know I never seemed to get a chance
to speak to you.
I only joined the club because of you and now...
I hear that you're not even in the new play.
Somebody else has to have a chance, it's only fair.
Gwen is awfully good, she will do it very well.
Quiet, please.
Damn... What are you doing after rehearsal?
We've got a party at home tonight. Jack's gonna collect me.
He should be here any minute.
I thought he was back at Cambridge.
He came for the weekend.
Come on, Joe.
Now, same positions.
We're wasting time. Take your coats off.
Come on Joe, speed it up. On top of the sofa there.
Alice, love. I want to go from the scene
where you defend your lover.
It's the top of page 12. Now stand there.
There we are. "I don't see why ..."
And don't forget, love, there's the audience.
Push it right out. From when I say go, ready ?
Right!
I don't see why. He didn't even know my late husband.
I assure you, inspector, he has got nothing to do with it.
He has something to do with you, though,
hasn't he?
Really.
Just what do you mean by that, inspector?
Oh, I meant you were a friend of hers, sir.
You are, aren't you?
I tell you, I didn't see anything.
It was pitch dark...
and the only sign of light was this old workman
or night watchman sitting by his brassiere.
Brazier.
That's a wonderful thought.
Erotic vise among the working class.
Let me tell you, I am working class.
I didn't mean...
Working class and proud of it!
Nothing of the sort! You're a stock broker
and Alice's lover
and suspected of murder in the play.
Now shut up, the lot of you.
Now we'll start again...
and when you come to when you say
"What's the point?"
I want you to make a turn, half turn towards the window.
Hi.
I didn't mean to snap at you.
Oh, forget it.
Will you come and have a coffee with me?
No, but you may buy me a drink.
Can you drive?
Yes, oddly enough.
Of course I never owned a car
but I learned to drive in the RAF.
Here.
You're very touchy, aren't you?
Where to?
To the Saint Claire. It's quiet.
That's the Brown's place.
Yes, I know. I walked passed it.
Hmm, seems to have something on tonight.
Susan told me that they were having a party.
What a place!
It's like a castle.
Charles tells me that they've even got a swimming pool.
They've got just about everything, haven't they?
I wouldn't say that.
If you really want to know I thought you were coming
the lady of the mansion over me, that's all.
My father didn't know any engineering works or a mill.
He never even owned his own house.
But that doesn't mean that I can't drive a car
or pronounce brazier.
Who cares about these things?
Some people do.
It's Susan, isn't it?
That's what's bothering you.
It's Jack Wales, really.
That type, they make me mad.
The boys with the big mouths
and the silver spoon stuck in them.
They think they can take everything worth having
by a sort of divine right.
Calling me sergeant.
It is Susan.
Alf, could we have the same again, please?
Right away, Mrs. Aisgill.
You're jealous.
I suppose I am.
Why don't you phone the girl
and ask her to go out with you then?
Why don't you?
You feel inferior to Jack Wales?
No, I don't.
I've a feeling and I know I'm right.
I know she doesn't want him.
I suppose you think I'm conceited.
Young and terribly inexperienced, but not conceited.
Well, if that's the way you really feel about him,
then you must be right.
Your trouble is you don't believe enough in yourself.
I'll tell you something, Alice.
I like you, I don't mean sex, I mean "like you".
I like to talk to you.
I just... like you.
You look about 18 sometimes.
Do you know that?
You remind me of a boy I used to know
in university in Paris.
It must be funny being French here in Warnley.
No, it's not funny.
Are you very unhappy, Alice?
Not very... Come on.
Susan, there's a telephone call for you.
Who is it?
It's a gentleman. I think he said Mr. Lampton.
What will I tell him?
Oh, it's alright, Mary. I'll take it.
Very well, Miss Susan.
Hello... Susan Brown.
Oh, hello, Joe. I didn't know it was you.
Saturday evening? I'd love to but...
Hold on a minute.
Hello, Joe. I've just looked up in my book,
I've got another engagement on Saturday.
Yes, I'd love to some other time.
Gosh! Here's mummy... Bye.
Who's that telephoning, Susan?
Joe Lampton. I met him at "The Thespians".
What did he want?
He wanted to take me to the cinema on Saturday.
But we don't know him, do we?
Socially, I mean.
I don't suppose so.
He works at the Town Hall.
Really?
It's alright, mummy. I told him I had a previous appointment,
but only because I had.
He's very nice really.
What did you say his name was ?
Lampton, Joe Lampton.
Curious names some of these people have.
Listen, Alice... Tell me.
Supposing you were a girl...
I mean a young girl. And I asked you out.
I mean, would you hang up in a hurry
just because your mother came into the room?
Look, Joe, if I had a mother like Mrs. Brown,
I would hang up in a great hurry
whenever she came into the room.
Aren't you two coming? Where's Charles?
He'll be over in a minute.
I still think she was trying to give me the brush off.
Well, supposing she was.
Keep trying, call her again.
You really mean it?
Of course. Why not?
Oh, while I'm handing out advice,
Do you mind if I tell you about our last scene?
The bedroom one.
Oh, I know I... I made a mock of it.
You're not frightened of me, are you?
No.
Well you must take hold of me as if you meant it.
I'm not fragile, you know.
I won't break.
I'll try, Alice.
Is it so difficult?
That we'll be another bitter gin 'n tonic...
Have you got any crisps?
Hello, Alice. I was just telling them about Gwen.
What?
Bernard and I were talking to her after the rehearsal
the other day and she said
I'll take him on myself, but I can't bear
bandy-legged man.
Good evening. Bernard said you'd be here.
Hello, George. This is a surprise.
It's not a social call.
I think you know everybody, don't you?
Yes, I think so.
And of course, Joe Lampton, my lover in the play.
The war hero.
Well I'm always glad to meet one of Alice's lovers.
Look, Alice, let me have the keys, will you?
I've got to take the Citröen.
Why?
My ignition's gone and I've got to get over to Leeds tonight.
So late?
Something cropped up unexpectedly.
I'll be away a couple of days.
But...  what about the car for tomorrow?
What about it?
You know I was going to take Elspeth
to Manchester to the ballet.
You know I arranged it weeks ago.
Well, you'll just have to make it some other time,
won't you?
Enjoy yourselves everybody.
Goodnight, dear.
I thought you said you were going to be
word perfect tonight.
Well I thought I would till I got on stage.
Well, Bernard...
You know what that means.
A couple of days of hard labor with his secretary.
Yeah...  Does she?
Shall I see you home?
No.
Alice, I hate to see you hurt.
I'm not hurt.
You sure you don't want me to take you home?
I'd like to.
I'd rather not.
Good night, Joe.
Joe!
Shhh!
What are you doing here?
I was just thinking about you.
You were?
I was thinking about you when I passed the Town Hall
and the thought stuck on.
Like a hangover.
What were you thinking about me?
Nothing exactly.
What are you doing here?
I often come down here to do the library account.
You know, Susan,
you're looking very pretty.
Thank you kindly, sir.
Do you think this is any good?
I wanted it, but there's a waiting list.
If you could wait for me for about 10 minutes,
we can go and have some coffee together.
I can't, I'm meeting my mother for lunch.
Oh well... they tell me that there's a very good film
on at the Regal.
The musical? Super!
Have you seen it?
No.
Would you like to go?
Yes.
When?
Oh.
You know, Susan...
you're not only pretty, you're beautiful.
Tonight then.
Oh, tonight will do like no other night has ever done.
I'll pick you up at your house. At 7 o'clock.
No, I'd rather meet you there.
7 o'clock at the Regal.
7 o'clock then... at the Regal.
Charles! Lend me a quid.
What for?
Come on. Later, I'll explain to you later.
All right.
Hurry up!
Thank you.
By the way do you remember that bet
I made with you the other day?
Which one?
At the dog races. Do you remember?
Oh, yes.
Well you've lost, you owe me 15 bob.
No!
Yes!
You know, you're the sort of girl I like to take out.
Why?
Well, there's your shape, and your size,
and the sheen in your hair, the sort of light in your eyes.
Oh but, the most important because
I think you're a dear keeper.
A what?
A dear keeper.
It's a lovely word! What does it mean?
My mother called me that every time I asked her
for something that cost more than she could afford.
I'd like to meet your mother, she sounds fun.
She's dead.
I'm sorry.
My mother and my father were both killed in an air raid.
I don't even know if it was an air raid.
The only bombs that ever did dropped in Dufton,
probably by mistake.
Anyhow they had to fall on our house.
Joe, how awful for you.
I'm terribly sorry.
It's alright.
It happened a long time ago.
Good evening.
Aren't you going to offer me a drink?
Jack!
I thought you were washing your hair tonight.
Waiter!
You're not a hairdresser too, are you, sergeant?
No, I'm not a hairdresser
and I'm not your bloody back man...
A large Scotch for me please.
Don't let us keep you ...
Not at all, it's a pleasure.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to have a chat
with you for a long time
about your acting actually.
I think you have distinct comic possibilities.
Don't you agree, Susan?
If you'll excuse me...
If I live to be a hundred, Jack,
I'll never forgive you for this.
I thought you were gonna wash your hair tonight.
Well I don't know what you were thinking Llewelyn,
but you can take that away for a start.
I want to build a new administration block
not a ladies lavatory.
We make machine tools at Brown's, remember.
Not silk stockings.
You should never have let this young man
get so far with it.
I only saw a sketch Mr. Brown.
It looked very handsome.
You come back tomorrow with some designs I can use
or don't bother to come back at all!
Either of you, go on get out!
Miss Bishop!
Yes, sir!
What's happened to that London call?
It's engaged, sir!
Well, will you try the other number?
I must get those shares on the market before they close.
Very good, sir.
Hello, what are you two doing here?
Susan's just told me she's going out tonight.
I want you to tell her not to.
Oh, why?
One thing, the number of guests will upset my table.
Another is that Joe Lampton again.
Can't you put him off for once Susan?
Just to please your mother?
No, I can't. It isn't just tonight.
Mother doesn't like him.
She doesn't think he's suitable.
Do you?
I don't know about suitable, but I like him.
He calls me a dear keeper.
A what?
You explain to mother, daddy, I'm sure you know.
Goodbye, I'm late...
Don't be cross. You know I love you both.
That doesn't get me anywhere with my dinner party.
Why didn't you stop her?
Because stopping her from seeing this young man
isn't the way to put an end to it.
Then what is?
Or don't you mind her getting mixed up
with a small town nobody?
Small town nobodies sometimes do well enough.
You saw that wrong with one once, mother.
I happen to be Susan's mother, not yours.
Now listen, will you stop bothering your head
about Joe Lampton?
And just leave it to me.
Get me the town hall.
I have a minute to do,
I thought we might have a little chat.
You picked up the work very quickly.
6 months now, isn't it?
Not quite.
You're a bright lad, Lampton.
And you've also a lover's sense.
Sense enough I'm sure and not to resent
what I'm going to say to you.
This is a small town, Lampton.
I've lived in it all my life.
I know the people, I know the business.
Councilor Brown, for instance.
I went to school with him.
You know, of course, he's chairman
of the establishment committee.
Yes, but I don't quite see...
He's a powerful man, Lampton.
That engineering works of his, built it up from nothing.
Now it's the biggest of its kind in Warnley.
Ruthless. Well I suppose you've got to be ruthless
in business.
He knows what he wants and he gets it.
He can drive a coach-and-four through that committee
anytime he wants.
Every council is the same.
There's always one strong man, a danger man,
as far as the officials are concerned.
Mind you, no matter how influential
any councilor may be
he can't touch our jobs, he can't grieve us.
But when it comes to promotion
there is the rump. That's a different matter.
You follow me Joe?
I follow you.
I thought you would.
Do you mind if I give you a word of advice, Joe?
It's this: find a girl, a girl of your own...
Class! Is that what you mean Mr. Hoylake?
A girl of my own class?
Well, let's say background.
Plenty of nice girls in Warnley, pretty ones too.
You'll find the right kind of girl, Joe.
You'll go a long way here in Warnley.
You wouldn't believe this!
Who the hell he thinks he is
sitting there like a phony putting the finger on me?
Oh, I got the works, the chairman of the establishment committee
and the rest.
As neat a job of blackmail as you ever saw.
You follow me, Joe? Yes, he even called me Joe.
If you don't leave Susan alone,
there will be no promotion for you.
I told you months ago Joe, I warned you. She's not for you !
In another couple of minutes...
I would have taken his promotion out of his mouth
and shoved it up his... waist coat.
Fares, please...
Two to Warnley Theatre, please.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Just mood.
I have bad moods sometimes. Don't you?
Damnable moods. Take today, for instance.
Here.
You need a drink.
No.
You want me to drive you home?
No, I'd like to go to Sparrow Hill.
It's cold up there.
That's what I want. Somewhere cold and clean.
With no people, no dirty people.
Something going on there.
Well you know Alice.
Don't be catty darling. Alice is a very charming
and very long-suffering person.
Alice is all woman.
George is away for the weekend.
He is often away for weekends.
How did you meet him?
I'm was a teacher, what you call an exchange teacher.
I came over for one year in '37
and I met George.
Can't imagine you as a teacher.
I was a good teacher.
Oh, Alice...
Don't say anything.
This is a very moral kind of a girl.
Good morning Charles, I don't understand this,
I hardly know the man.
Hmm, seems a good job. And in Dufton.
So what are you gonna do about it?
I don't know. See him, I suppose.
Chances are, my days at the Treasuries Department
are numbered anyway.
Don't be daft!
Why don't you look at it as a free trip home.
Home? My home is a bomb site.
This is my house. It's my house.
It used to be mine too.
I lived here once upon a time.
A bomb fell from the sky.
I know.
Do you wanna see my garden?
Aye.
Look!
Oh, they are pretty. What are they called?
Flowers, they're called flowers.
Ethel! Ethel, come here at once.
My mother.
At once, Ethel. Come here at once.
If I told you once, I've told you a dozen times.
You must be new here.
No.
But you weren't here in the old days.
Come on here. How many more times have I to say?
I was just looking at the house,
what's left of it.
I just don't like her talking to strangers, that's all.
I'm not really a stranger.
Vera!
Alright, alright.
Uncle Nat.
Is that you Joe?
Yes, auntie.
Come and tell us all about it.
Did you see Mr. Darley, was he nice?
Oh, I haven't seen him yet. My appointment is at 4.
Oh, well that's fine. I've just made tea.
It's nice to have you back.
Just like old times.
Now you can move in your room then.
Then you can have your own room back.
The window's alright. Your cousin finally stirred himself
and mended that rotten pane.
We've missed you, lad.
It's right grand that you're back home again.
I'm not sure if I'm going to take that job, auntie.
Why ever not?
It isn't that I wasn't happy here.
I know that.
Good and thick.
Nice... and let the spoon stand up in it.
Well, it's just that...
Warnley is a different kind of a town.
I mean there's a different sort of people.
Got a girl Joe?
I have.
Go on. Here that, Nat?
Her name's Susan. Susan Brown.
Go on, you great lummox.
Well, she's sort of special. you know.
Her father owns a factory. He's on the council,
Warnley council, that is.
Sounds like lot of brass.
He's rolling in money.
You know, this is the first right cup of tea I've had
since I've left here.
I asked you about the girl and all you tell me
is about her father and his brass.
Joe, you wouldn't sell yourself for a handful of silver.
You know I wouldn't do that.
Money marries money lad.
What's the good of a girl like that to you?
She'll only break your heart.
Stick to your own people, Joe.
Oh, that's old fashioned, all that class stuff.
Things have changed since the war.
If I want her, I'll have her.
You sure it's the girl you want, Joe?
Not the brass?
What's wrong with wanting both?
I'm as good as the next man.
I'm entitled to be in love with any girl.
You may or you may not. I don't know about that.
But you're not entitled to be in love
with her money, lad.
Where are you going?
You haven't finished your tea.
If I don't hurry, I'll be late.
I haven't made up my mind yet.
If the money is good, I'll see what Mr. Darley has to say.
As for the new machines,
well, I don't know if it's a good thing.
But I've got to have it proved to me.
I must break even within 4 years.
But that's your problem.
Well, lad, what do you say?
Well lad, what do you say?
I'd like to think about it, Mr.Darley.
You staying here in Dufton?
Just for the weekend at my aunt's.
Oh, well 24 hours should be enough.
Ring me tomorrow.
I remember your father well.
He was a good man, was Lampton.
He worked here for 35 years.
I've got a meeting. It's late already.
Addie will show you out.
Goodbye, sir.
Kind of old Darley to think of me for that job.
Well lad, let's say you come highly recommended.
Oh?
You've got a powerful friend in Mr.Brown.
He's praised you to the skies, I'm told.
We do a lot of business with his firm in Warnley.
Something wrong?
No.
Tell your boss I've gone back to Warnley.
Yes, but I'm afraid she's not...
Who's that, Mary?
It's that Mr.Lampton, Madam.
Oh, I'll take it.
Yes, madam.
Thank you.
Hello, this is Susan's mother.
Oh, can I speak to Susan, please?
No, I'm afraid you can't.
She's in the south of France.
Can you tell me where I could write to her?
I'm afraid I can't give your her address.
You see, she's touring.
But thank you for calling, Mr....
LAMPTON !
And thank you again for being so very kind
to Susan. Goodbye.
Goodbye !
Charles, you wouldn't believe it.
They're playing right into my hands.
They sent her away, they're scared of me.
Watch it, Joe! Do you want me to drop
these unspeakably delicious sausages?
Of me!
Who has sent who away?
Susan, of course! Susan's parents.
Now how can people get to be so stupid?
You know, all I have to do now is to sit under the tree
and wait for the apple to drop.
For a chap just has been separated form his lady love
you don't seem to be taking it very hard.
Why should I care? I've got compensations.
Come on, eat.
Oh, darling... It's late.
And Elspeth will be here any minute.
Come on. Put that on.
Oh, you are..
What's that word you were?
Insatiable.
That's it. That's what you are.
Old man, insatiable... You want coffee?
Tea.
Poor Elspeth. She lends us her flat
and we pinch all her food.
You know, I hate you to put your clothes on.
It's very sweet of you honey,
but I'm too old to walk about in my girdle.
Oh, you're not old.
Oh, yes I am. But you already knew.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that.
I'm 25 and I've had a lot of experience.
I'm sure you have.
Well, my love, you're very old and very mature.
You know, I never dreamed that it could ever be like this.
So good.
There never was anyone so good to me before.
I'm alive now. All of me is alive.
It hurts sometimes but I don't care.
Why did you marry him?
Let's not talk about it.
You're hungry?
I'm always hungry.
I haven't got seniors to call me.
Take these through, will you?
Herring... and the pickles.
Oui, madame.
I'll get some bread.
Ooh, I cut my finger.
I'm alright.
I like you doing things for me.
I like doing things for you, anything.
I'll go and get the tea.
No...
You're so good to me.
I'll be good for you too.
I can't tell you how good.
Elspeth!
Don't be so bourgeois!
Hello, Elspeth.
Oh, hello, dears. I hope I haven't disturbed you.
I do try and be discreet but I had to come in.
It was cold outside.
Let me get you some tea.
Hello, Elspeth.
What an afternoon I've had, worst production,
my goodness.
Some of those girls. I don't know why I ever went
in for this sort of thing, I don't really.
Don't put your daughter on the stage,
Mrs. Worthington.
If you give us a concert, you will have some food.
Oh, lovely, dear.
You're a lucky young man, Joe.
Alice is an angel, a perfect angel, a heart of gold.
Cigarette?
I don't blame her. You're the sort of man I like.
Too many pansies around these days.
I knew a lot of real men once,
they're all dead now.
A little mess like me carries on.
Do you love Alice?
Yes.
I thought so.
She's crazy about you. You know that, I suppose.
She doesn't know it herself yet.
Don't hurt her, Joe. Don't ever hurt her.
No, I wouldn't hurt her.
I hope not.
It's for you, Joe.
Thank you, Charles.
We've made it.
"Having a wonderful time. Missing Warnley a lot."
Dear Susan, Imaginative, isn't she?
You know what that means, missing you.
And she's put the address on again.
That can only mean one thing.
She wants you to write to her.
Well, I'm not going to.
Why not?
Well one reason is because she expects me to.
Second because I wouldn't know what to write.
You're getting pretty keen on Alice, aren't you?
You worry me, Joe. You can't do it, you know.
You can't woo two women.
Not in a town this size.
Do you ever think of George Aisgill?
No, why should I?
Because he's dangerous.
Dangerous, Aisgill?
If he ever goes after you, well God help you,
that's all I say.
Come on.
Darling, will you tell me something, will you?
What love?
Supposing you had met me when I was 10 years younger,
would you have taken me seriously?
You know, I would.
Imagine me as I was 10 years ago,
and you as you are now.
There were no lines then.
Would you have loved me and wanted to marry me?
Yes. But I'll tell you something
What?
I like you the way you are now.
You'd like me much more when I was your age.
I've never known anyone like you.
Oh, I'd like to sleep with you, I mean, truly sleep
and wake up beside you in the morning.
How is the time, ohh...
Alice, you're beautiful.
I'd like a picture of you like that.
There is a picture of me in the nude somewhere.
You're joking.
No, there really is.
I was at the university at the time.
And I met an artist at a party.
He wanted a model.
I don't suppose it was even a good painting.
How often did you do this?
Only once.
Are you sure?
Of course, I'm sure.
I don't tell lies, you know that.
You never told me. Why didn't you tell me?
Because I had forgotten about it.
Oh, darling, what a fuss.
I didn't sleep with him
if that's what you're thinking.
But why? Why did have to do it?
There are millions of women a lot poorer
than you ever were
who'd rather die than expose themselves
for a few lousy rotten shillings.
Damn you to hell, I feel like
I'd like to beat you black and blue.
What's it to do with you?
It was long before I met you.
I must remember your beastly little provincial mind
doesn't like nudity.
You stupid bitch, it isn't that at all!
Don't you see it's the idea of other people looking
at your nakedness that I hate,
it's not decent, don't you see?
Oh, I understand now what makes men
kill women like you.
Oh, you're very brave and very moral all of a sudden.
That's what you like, isn't it?
Leg show and lingerie.
It's indecent for me to pose for an artist who sees me
as an arrangement of lines and color
but it's perfectly ok for you to kiss me all over
and lie for an hour just looking at me.
I suppose it gives you a thrill.
A dirty little thrill. I suppose you see me
as your own private dirty postcard.
You can't imagine that a man could look at a naked woman
without wanting to make love to her.
Can you?
If you want to know, I can't.
Elspeth isn't rich, you know.
You needn't drink all her gin.
Give that to her and tell her I broke the bottle.
To think I ever let you touch me.
Now listen, I own my own body and I'm not ashamed of it.
And I'm not ashamed of anything I've ever done.
If you mixed with intelligent people,
you wouldn't be glaring at me
as if I had committed some crime.
Oh, some of the things you've told me about yourself...
I can just see you in Dufton now.
Looking at nudes in magazines, drooling over them.
Saying you wouldn't mind having a quick bash.
That's one of your words, isn't it?
But blackguarding the girls, calling them shameless whores...
Oh, shut up!
You make a great to-do about your humble beginnings...
but you've never really been humble.
You've never gone hungry.
What do you think a POW gets to eat?
Hmm, even then you didn't starve.
There's always been somebody to take care of old Joe.
You got extra, you told me yourself.
Because you got along so well with the guards.
Why didn't you have the guts to escape?
Like Jack Wales ?
Don't mention that swine's name to me.
It was alright for him to escape.
He had a rich father to look after him
and buy him an education.
Those 3 years were the only chance I'd get
to be qualified.
Let those rich bastards who have all the fun, be heroes.
Let them pay for their privileges.
If you want it straight from this soldier,
I was bloody well pleased when I was captured.
I didn't like being a prisoner but it was a damn sight
better than being dead.
Come to that!
What did you do 50 years ago back in the Great War?
You want some tea?
I don't want anything.
It was good while it lasted.
I mean that.
I'm sorry it had to end like this.
I'm sorry too.
Goodbye, Alice.
Goodbye.
Ahh, Cinderella has arrived.
Charles...
He was always interfering, always interfering...
Whiskey, please.
Yeah, whiskey... Oh, that reminds me.
Did you hear about the chap who asked the girl
if she wanted her whisky and solver?
She said, who would ever want that?
But I'll have a gin...
I'll have a gin and platonic.
The whisky and solver, gin platonic...
It's a play of words.
Oh, well, you didn't understand it.
Wait a minute, I'm sorry about that.
Hey, have you heard this one?
Good evening, Susan.
I hope you had a nice holiday.
Hello Joe. Have you met my father and mother?
This is Mr. Lampton, mother.
How do you do Mr. Lampton?
How do you do?
I've seen you at the Town Hall, lad.
You know his worship the mayor and mayoress.
One of our bright young man in the treasuries office.
Well, what are you drinking?
Scotch, please.
Make it a large one.
By the way, weren't you at Milden Hall?
Yes, 551 squadron.
Oh, I had very good friend in that squadron.
As I said, I remember the steps, alright,
my trouble is to know which one to take.
Well, give me the Lancers every time.
Darrow, Chip Darrow, he was a nice chap.
I went to school with him.
No, I don't remember him.
But you must have met him.
Old Chip? Why, you couldn't miss him.
But, no, I've never met him.
You come from Dufton, don't you?
It was Dufton, wasn't it?
Yes, sir.
Must be quite a change for you.
How is Canon Jones? I haven't seen him in...
must be nearly two years,
You know Canon Jones, don't you?
No, I'm afraid, I don't.
Charming wife and terribly lively,
don't you think?
You know J.C. Brotherton, I'm sure of that.
I know him much in much the same way
as I know the Prime Minister.
My father used to work in one of his mills
as an over looker.
Now that's nice, don't you think?
I've noticed this orchestra, year after year,
the older the piece the happier they are with it.
Well, speaking of Dufton, an extraordinary chap there,
Jack Cleavely.
Chucking his money around alright
he's well on his way to his Knighthood.
He drove father to a meeting last month,
he's got a large Mercedes.
Father said he drove like a maniac.
You know him, don't you?
I don't know any tally man.
Oh, come, now.
I don't follow you, old man.
A tally man is... well he sells clothes on credit,
money lending at fantastic high interest rates.
It's business.
You wouldn't refuse the profits, would you?
It's dirty business.
Henry I don't know if you're aware of it or not
but this is our dance.
Good night Mr. Lampton.
Well, Sue, are you gonna risk it with me?
Come on, Sue. See you later, sergeant.
Don't worry about the way the world runs, lad.
Enjoy it, while you're young.
Hmm...
Joe, if you're free, I could see you
at the dance after next.
Joe, why didn't you write?
You didn't write either. Only postcards.
I was waiting for you to write.
A girl can't write first.
She can't if she has any pride.
Why did you go away without letting me know?
I had to, they sent me away.
Don't you believe me?
Oh, I believe you.
But that's why I didn't write.
Because I knew how hopeless it was.
Why?
You know it's hopeless, Susan.
Tell me, Joe, please.
Well you saw them in there when I met your parents,
the way they were needling me
and you couldn't do anything about it.
I wanted to, really I did.
One day they'll say
you mustn't see that vulgar person again.
They wouldn't dare.
I won't ever let them come between us.
It's useless, Susan.
You know it is.
Let me kiss you.
Just this once.
Don't you care about me?
Maybe it's because I care too much.
I love you, Joe.
I love you.
I love you too.
Do you really?
Oh, Joe, how much?
Very much.
No!
I'm sorry, Joe.
Really I am.
Gosh, I'm hot!
You shouldn't feel hot. You've nothing on.
Is that better?
Is that what prim Joe wants?
No, that's not what Joe wants.
You know what Joe wants.
It's what all the Joes want.
Oh, Joe.
You know, sometimes when you kiss me
I feel as if you weren't really there.
I'm here alright and I can prove it.
Seriously, Joe, there's something wrong, isn't there?
Don't you like the way I make love?
Oh, I like it very much.
It reminds me of a good set of mixed tennis.
That's not a very kind thing to say...
I sometimes don't feel very kind.
Why?
Your mother and father,
were they kind to me the other night?
I can just see your mother now.
Saying "You mustn't see that vulgar Lampton boy
again or whatever his name is,
the one with the bulging shirt and the chromium cufflinks."
And then there's you...
You lead me on so far and then you stop me.
What do you think I'm made of?
It's not that I don't want to.
It's just... I suppose I'm scared.
I do love you Joe!
I'd do anything for you, Joe, anything!
Except what any girl would do for the man she loves.
Joe, how much do you love me?
Very much.
About a million pounds worth.
Joe, be gentle with me.
Oh, let's face it darling, he was a brute, a coarse brute!
Oh, I know it's hell right this minute
but the way I look at it, he's the loser.
Come on Susan, I think we'd better be going now.
I don't want to go. I don't ever want to go.
Is isn't super, Joe? Now we really belong to each other.
Really and truly till death do us part.
Wasn't it wonderful?
Wasn't it absolutely the most wonderful thing
that ever happened to you?
Wasn't it, Joe?
Yes... Come on let's go.
Must we really go?
You know, we must.
Besides your mother...
Poor mummy, if only she knew.
That's quite a thought.
Joe, do you know I don't really feel any different.
I thought I'd feel terribly different and I don't.
Joe, do you feel different?
You don't really want to talk about it, do you?
You're not really sentimental, are you?
No, I'd rather not talk about it.
Joe, do you know something?
I do believe you're a prig.
You're really shier than I am, aren't you?
Actually.
I expect I am.
Do I look different?
Do I, Joe?
No.
I don't feel different.
Just the same, only better.
Are you sure?
Just a tiny bit?
Hey, come on Joe, what are you waiting for?
I think I'll hang on for a bit, I've got some work to do.
But it's Friday!
You can get along without me.
For the last few days you've been lower
than a snake's belly.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
You ought to be sitting pretty.
You always said Susan was your ticket away from
your old life, your first dividend on interest...
Yes, everything's going my way.
Ready chaps?
You two go ahead.
I don't think I'll come tonight.
What's the matter with him? What's wrong Joe?
I tell you, nothing's the matter.
I just don't happen to feel like boozing.
Come on Teddy,
Call me later, Joe, if you feel like it.
Nothing has changed.
Nothing at all.
I don't care about them.
I don't either.
I couldn't do without you.
I love you, Alice.
I love you.
Remember, what was it you once said?
Loving friends, you said.
Let's be loving friends.
I didn't want to fall in love with you.
I tried to fall in love with Susan.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know.
It's been hell these last weeks.
I want you all the time.
Not just stolen meetings.
Oh, Alice, listen, couldn't we...
I have a fortnight starting next month on the 15th.
Charles says he knows of a cottage belongs to a friend of his.
We could have it for a few days for next to nothing.
And there would be nobody for miles around.
Just us, together.
Oh, Alice, couldn't we?
No, I've never done this before.
Next time I do it,
I tell you it's going to be legitimate.
Darling, you sound like a lawyer.
I feel more like a Billingsgate porter.
Hmmm, not very flattering.
Oh, it's nice here.
There...
Thank you.
You know something?
Hmm?
I feel quite shy suddenly.
As if I really were a young bride.
I feel rather shy myself.
Oh, but it's a good feeling.
Yes...
No, no I don't want to smoke and I don't want to drink.
Because cigarettes and drink, they dull you.
I want every minute of these 4 days.
And I want them sharp and clear.
Alice...
you and George, do you still...
Tell me, I want to know, do you?
Very well, the answer is "Yes", sometimes.
But, Joe...
you don't know about these things.
They are not as simple as that, it's all mixed up.
You don't love him.
No.
You and him, it's...
Well, it's not like us, is it?
No, it's not.
You're such an honest person.
Why the hell do you have to be so honest?
Darling I'm glad you're so honest.
I love you for it.
Do you have to go tomorrow?
You know I have.
You know, I used to think it was a lot of romantic nonsense,
one man, one woman...
Not long ago I would have said
a man could be happy with any one of a 100 women.
Now I know you're my woman, Alice.
My ration. All the love I'll ever get now
or ever more.
And you've get all the love I'll ever have to give.
You've changed so much, Joe.
You know that?
So have you.
Yes, I've no more defenses.
How have I changed?
Oh, I don't know how to say it.
You're stronger now. More sure of yourself.
I was so angry with you at first
when you wanted Susan.
You seemed to want things for all the wrong reasons.
And you didn't see how you were damaging yourself
as a person.
You weren't proud to be you, just to be yourself.
But you're proud now, aren't you?
Oh, yes. Right now I'm the proudest man in the world.
You've got so much, Joe...
Everything. You don't ever have to pretend.
You just have to be yourself.
This above all to thine own self be true and...
And, and, and...
I've forgotten.
and it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
You're an educated and moral witch, Alice,
and I love you.
Oh, I've something for you.
Oh, no, it's much too nice for me.
I want you to have it...
to remind you the happiness we had.
You talk like a requiem.
This is only the beginning.
Are you sure?
I can't live without you.
I've tried and I can't. I need you.
Do you really mean it?
Do you want me to divorce George?
Yes. But would you?
What's so funny?
You.
I'm frightened. Nobody was ever meant
to be as happy as I am now.
It can't last. It's like a bubble that's going to burst
when I get on that train tomorrow.
That train.
Change your mind, Joe, come with me.
No, it's best as we arranged.
I'll take the next train and see you
when I get back from Dufton at Elspeth's.
It's only 10 days.
It's only a lifetime.
We'll work it out so that we can spend
the rest of our lives together.
Give me a cigarette, love.
I have a feeling that this is all
that we're going to have.
This is only the beginning.
Please walk away now, darling.
Walk away, don't look back.
Think of me.
Yes...
Mr. Aisgill, what can I...
Sit down.
What can I do for you?
Cigarette?
Nice case you have there.
You know why I am here.
Alice tells me she wants to divorce me.
Well I'm not agreeable.
You haven't any choice.
She's my wife and she's going to remain my wife.
I want to make it quite clear to you.
She has no grounds for divorce.
Everybody knows the way you treat Alice,
about you and your women.
But nobody can prove anything.
The difference between you and me is that
I haven't been indiscreet enough
to leave evidence lying around.
Meaning what?
Just this: If she brings an action for divorce
I'll fight it.
I'll smear you both across the headlines.
It will make fine reading.
Elspeth's flat...
the naked bathing in Dorset
and all the rest of it.
How did you know?
I make it my business to know.
It'll break you...
because you can't stand a scandal like that
and you know it.
And you won't get Alice either.
Because I still won't let her go.
You can't hold her. Maybe she can't divorce you
but she can leave you.
You can't stop her from leaving you.
Can you keep her?
I can keep her because I love her.
She's 10 years older than you
and she hasn't a penny of her own.
If she leaves me, I'll sue you for enticement.
Then you won't be able to support even yourself.
You got everything pretty well worked out,
haven't you?
I have, there are no loopholes.
Get it clear. From now on you'll leave Alice alone.
Understand me?
Why won't you let her go? Why?
Because she's my wife. That's why.
You trying to tell me you still love her?
I'm not trying to tell you anything.
I've let you off lightly.
There will be no more warnings.
Say that again.
I said that June and I have decided to go steady
and I wanted you to be the first one to know.
That's just wonderful.
Oh, Joe, show some enthusiasm.
Well I seem to remember you wanted a girl
with no responsibilities
and a small family business in the background.
Well that doesn't seem to matter much anymore.
Oh, and what about the invalid mother?
Oh, I get it.
She's died and left you a large insurance policy.
Oh, Joe...
No seriously, what about her invalid mother?
Well that don't seem to matter much either.
No...
June's a fine kid,
you couldn't have done better, Charles.
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinking of settling down myself.
That might be June. I'll be right with you, Joe.
Hey, Joe, it's for you. Mr. Brown.
Who?
God almighty, Brown, that's who.
He wants to talk to you.
Tell him my mother sent me touring on the Riviera.
Oh, no Joe, come on quick, he's waiting.
Oh, let him wait.
Joe, what's got into you lately?
I had enough threats for one day.
Come on!
Alright, I'm coming.
Yes?
Are you sure it's me
you want to speak to, Mr. Brown?
What...?
Yes, sir.
What did he want?
He wants me to lunch with him
at the Conservative Club at 1 o'clock.
Sit down. You're late.
He'll have the game soup.
First time you've been in this club, is it?
This or any other Conservative Club.
My father would turn in his grave
if he could see me now.
So would mine. But we're not bound
by our fathers.
I've got a proposition for you.
You're a clever young man.
You don't want to stay in the Town Hall
the rest of your life, do you?
Now is the time that accountants can do well
for themselves.
Now, I'm willing to set you up in business.
Buy you a partnership.
Well, what do you say?
There's a catch somewhere.
Not a catch but a condition.
I'll set you up on condition that you never see Susan again
or communicate with her.
Now just what's so funny about that, young man?
Nothing I could explain.
If you agree, I'll make you a rich man.
You'll be a damn sight better off
then you'll ever be in local government.
Well, what do you say?
Are you trying to buy me off?
That's right. I'm buying you off
and I'm paying a damn fine price for it.
Come on now, use your head.
You want to improve yourself,
you want to get in among the money.
Alright, I don't blame you for that.
But you're not getting at my brass through Susan.
You wouldn't talk to me like that I
if I were Jack Wales and had a rich daddy behind me.
I don't give a damn for Jack Wales.
A nice little business merger between the two families.
I don't barter my daughter.
You tried to barter her now.
That's enough!
I told you my offer, it's the best chance you'll ever have.
Now take it or leave it, but get this into your head.
If you refuse it, I'm going to break you.
And what's more, I shall run you out of Warnley!
Everybody wants to run me out of Warnley.
Let's say you kick me out and I take Susan with me.
She's in love with me, you know.
Susan's too young to know her own mind,
she'll do as I tell her.
If she disobeys me I shall cut her off
without a penny.
You mean throw her out?
If necessary.
I thought that might interest you.
No!
I say "No" to your bloody rotten offer!
Wait a minute!
Now I'll tell you what you're going to do.
Sit down.
You're marrying her with my consent,
right quick.
Am I?
That's right.
But I don't understand.
Don't you? The reason's very simple.
Yes, I'm glad you have the grace to blush.
But why didn't she tell me?
Chicken again?
I'll be turning into one soon, we'll have the pie.
I'll have a scotch please, a large one.
She didn't tell you because she didn't want you
to wear it out of a sense of duty.
And I didn't tell you because I wanted to try you out.
There's no need to laugh like that, young man.
This isn't the way I planned to have my daughter wed.
Now listen, you're gonna throw up your job
at the Town Hall.
I need somebody to reorganize the office,
I want some efficiency in that side of the business.
Well?
How about salary?
1.000 a year to start with.
Naught, if you don't make a success of it.
And there's just one other matter to be cleared up.
If you don't, it's all off.
You've been too ruddy long about it already.
Leave off Alice Aisgill. Now!
I'm not gonna have my daughter hurt anymore
and I'm not gonna have my son in law
in the divorce courts either.
Not on account of an old whore like that.
There's no need to talk about her in that way.
I use words that fit.
Now get done with her.
I'll not gonna have it put off anymore.
Bring coffee for two.
I'm driving over to Lettisford.
I'll drop you off at the house.
Susan wants to talk to you.
But... I've got to get back to the office.
I told Hoylake you were taking the afternoon off.
You can fix just about anything, can't you?
Just about.
I'll tell Miss Susan you're here.
Joe!
Joe isn't it wonderful? I'm so happy.
Now we're really going to be married.
Why didn't you tell me about the baby?
I don't know, you seemed so strange lately.
As if you didn't like me very much.
But it's alright now, isn't it, Joe?
Yes. Yes, it's all alright now.
Joe.
People have told me... even daddy said that you...
that you were having an affair with Alice Aisgill.
How could you?
She's so old!
Just an old whore like her,
that's what you mean, isn't it?
Well, it's all over now. So just forget about it.
How do I know that?
Because I'm telling you.
Listen, Joe. If you so much as look at her again,
we are through.
I don't care about the baby or anything, I mean it!
I won't be second best!
Promise me, you'll never ever gonna see her again!
I can't do that.
I'm going to see her just one more time
and tell her about us.
You could write to her.
I'm going to see her!
Joe, you do love me, don't you?
May I come in? Oh, hello, Mr. Lampton.
I suppose now I'd better call you Joe.
The sooner we get on with the arrangements
the better.
We've decided on a white wedding
in spite of the circumstances.
The first thing I require from you
is the list of the guests.
Darling, I thought you'd never come.
You're so late.
Come on.
I've got a surprise for you.
Come on, open it.
Oh...
You don't like it?
Yes, I like it very much but...
If you don't like it you can change it
for another color.
What's wrong, you look so serious.
No, I ... I like the color.
Alice...
Alice, sit down.
You won't me be hurting my feelings.
I'm not touchy about things like that.
I'm going to marry Susan.
Everything's fixed, even the date.
I'm going to marry her.
I put her in the family way.
What did you expect me to do, run away?
No, but that doesn't mean you have to marry her...
I've got to marry her!
You'll be telling me next you love her.
Look Alice, please.
Please, don't let's have a scene.
We were loving friends remember,
right from the start you said we were only loving friends.
It wasn't possible anyway you and me,
you know it wasn't.
George wouldn't let you go.
If you'd have taken him to court,
he would have thrown more muck
at us than either of us could stand.
I would have lost my job.
What could we have lived on?
You're a timid soul, aren't you?
I suppose you're going to work for Brown.
Yes.
You've done very well for yourself, Joe.
Finally, you've got everything you wanted,
haven't you?
There's something you have never understood, Joe.
These people at the top...
they are the same as anybody else.
but you had it inside of you
to be so much bigger than any of them.
You just had to be yourself, that was all.
With me you were yourself, only with me.
Do you understand what you have done?
Look, Alice...
I'm going to marry Susan.
Alright, maybe I do love you.
But I'm going to marry her.
Now please, don't make it any more difficult for us both.
Oh, to hell with you!
You think our love is just like a layer of dirt,
that I can wash it off?
I believed in our love.
What else have I got?
It's all I had to believe in.
You ask me not to make it difficult.
But I'm not like your aunt in Dufton.
Why shouldn't I make it difficult for you?
Because it won't do you any good, that's why.
I'm going to marry Susan.
Don't say it again. Please, don't say it again.
I think we need a little drink.
Look, Alice.
I wish you'd face facts.
I'll never love anyone else.
But there just isn't any future for us together.
What a pretty speech.
I suppose you worked that out before you came,
didn't you?
I'm never going to see you again,
that's what I came to tell you.
I'm going now.
No...
Goodbye, Alice.
Are you alright Mrs. Aisgill?
She's got her skin full.
I've never seen her like that before.
She'll be alright.
She knows her way around.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr.Lampton.
Oh, Miss Beth, I'd like to get everything outstanding
settled as soon as possible.
Starting with the gas. How about the profit and loss
appropriation account?
Oh, it can wait.
Oh, Mr. Lampton...
I would like to congratulate you.
Mr. Hoylake told Gladys...
Well, you know how these things get about.
I hope you'll both be very happy together.
Thank you very much.
Did you hear about the accident?
Have you set the date of the wedding yet?
No? What accident?
No, not definitely.
It's Alice Aisgill. She's dead.
It will be the wedding of the year, I'm sure.
Who's dead? Alice Aisgill.
Well, I hope so.
Miss Brown...
if you don't mind my saying so,
will make a lovely bride.
She ran the car off the cliff at Sparrow Hill.
I heard she was drunk.
What's that?
Alice Aisgill, Mr.Lampton.
They say that the car was bent like that
and blood all over the place.
What was she doing up at Sparrow Hill, anyway?
Oh, goodness knows, she'd been drinking, alright.
Probably didn't know where she was.
There he is!
Joe, congratulations laddy.
Couldn't have happened to a nicer chap.
He was trying to tell me about it the other night, you know,
weren't you Joe?
Come on Remar. bring that through now.
We've got a little surprise for you, Joe.
Come on lad, quick!
Well, unwrap it! Oh, come here!
Look, Joe, champagne!
Here comes the bride, all dressed in white...
It's the real stuff, you know?
Hello! There you are, Joe.
Well, so you're to be leaving us, are you?
Marrying into big business.
Well, well, congratulations.
What's the matter?
We were just talking about the accident,
Mr. Hoylake.
What accident?
Alice Aisgill's dead.
Her car crashed last night.
No!
Nasty business.
I met Dr. Everett, he told me.
You knew her well, didn't you Joe?
Yes. I knew her.
Wouldn't have been so bad if she died outright.
Good looking woman too,
it's hard on Aisgill.
Is it true that they didn't find her till this morning?
I am afraid so, she was terribly mutilated.
I heard it was a farm laborer who found her.
I heard she was crawling about the road
in her own blood.
It wasn't that I was thinking about.
Apparently she's been struck by the steering wheel.
What's the matter?
You low rotten chiseler!
You murdering little fancy man!
Are you happy now, you swine?
You got rid of her nicely, didn't you?
You don't understand.
You bastard, you bastard!
You dirty, filthy bastard!
She was in your way, wasn't she?
Get out of here, you filthy little blood sucker!
Oh, Joe, how could you do it to...
She loved you so, how could you do it?
I said what's your name, dear?
Ehh?
What's your name?
Jack Wales.
And what do you really sell?
I told you, I specialize in ladies' underwear.
Oh, you're a devil, Jack. You really are.
Come along, Mavis, let's go.
Oh, go away. We were alright till you came.
I couldn't help being late.
You see, I was working over at the factory, love.
Look you'd bloody well stop that,
you're coming along with me.
Leave her alone!
You stick to your own class!
You come walking in here,
you and your money think you can buy the place,
I've seen your type before, you know.
Now just keep out of this!
I told you to leave her alone!
Look I warned you, I'll slash your bloody dizzard!
Take your hands off her!
He's not really my boyfriend.
Not really, Jack.
Just because he's taken me out a couple of times,
he thinks he owns me, he does.
He don't know how to treat a girl proper.
He's not like you, Jack.
Hey, boy! Same again.
You don't want any more to drink,
really you don't.
Don't I?
What you need is some fresh air.
Come on.
Alice, Alice...
It's Mavis, is my name.
Oh, you're wonderful. Oh, you really are.
Oh, you've such lovely hands, like a gentleman.
Oh, shut up!
Jack, I've always wanted to meet someone like you.
I always have.
You wouldn't pass out on me.
You mustn't go to sleep.
Jack, come on, Jack.
Let's go.
Are you alright now, Jack?
Now you turn left, remember,
and go straight on down the canal.
Have you enough for a taxi?
Oh, God, they've woken up.
Good night, Jack. It's been lovely, really it has.
Joe! Joe!
Time to come home, Joe.
It's alright, love. Everything's alright now.
I've murdered her...
Hush, hush...
I killed her...
Everybody knows I killed her.
Don't take on so.
I wasn't planning but I killed her.
Nobody's blaming you, Joe.
You don't see it now,
but she'd have ruined your whole life.
Oh, no, nobody will ever blame you, Joe.
Nobody but me.
That's the trouble.
I require and charge you both...
as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgment
when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed
that if either of you know any impediments
why ye may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony...
ye do now confess it.
For be ye well assured
that so many as are coupled together otherwise
than God's words doth allow
are not joined together by God,
neither is their matrimony lawful.
Joseph, wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife,
to live together after God's ordinance
in the holy state of matrimony
wilt thou love her, comfort her,
honor and keep her,
in sickness and in health
and forsaking all other
keeping only unto her
so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
Joe...
wasn't it absolutely the most wonderful wedding?
Now we really belong to each other
till death us do part.
Darling, you're crying.
I believe you really are sentimental after all.
