Excuse me, Miss. The gentleman over there

Deal.
Deal.
lt"s Newton.
N-E-W-T-O-N.
Do you have a table?
-Lord Dobbs.
-lt"s all right. He"s whit us.
Y need a way to get on the Journey.
You"re on your own, lady..
How about at least printing a teaser on
this story?
You get me a photo, and Y might get it in
""Around the word""
Wait. Here"s the wire..
Aren"t you the one we sent to the Orient
to get out of our hair?
Hello. Newman, you there?
Oh, my God.
You see, Chris, the problem is that you
can"t get into
this wretched ""Ghan-gheng"" thing without
a special invitation.
We"ll forge it.
lmpossible. Apparently, it has a map on
it.
So we are faced with a real dilemma.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning, Miss Newton. What are
you so cheerful about?
Because Y hold in my hand your ticket to
that Journey.
Not so fast.
First we make a deal.
What kind of deal?
Y go with you to the Ghan-gheng.
How do we know it"s good?
it"s good. lt"s very good.
Without it, your plans are worthless.
That"s me. Devine. Y need some help.
Come with me.
-Mr. Devine?
-That"s me.
Welcome to Bangkok. l"m Edgar Dobbs
from the Ghan-gheng Committee.
This is Harry and Christopher Dubois,
your personal valet.
This is great. Y thought Y was gonna get
stuck with a couple
of little Oriental fellas who didn"t
speak no English.
Not for you, champ. Chris the bags.
Dobbs, l"m gonna kill you.
Not yet. Remember...
""lt"s thieves with pride that dangle from
the gallows""
Who said that?
Edgar Dobbs. lvory Coast, 1920.
Besides, we have an almost perfect plan.
Maxie has the map and the invitation that
are going to get us into the Lost City.
All that will be on his mind is
fighting..
Miss Newton is off getting her story of
the century.
ln the meantime, you, Harry and yours
truly...
...will be devising ways and means of
stealing the dragon.
Sounds good to me.
lt is perfect.
All we have to do is keep the champ in
our pocket.
Are we ready to go?
Thank you.
Who is this?
Carry Newton. lt"s a pleasure to meet the
heavyweight champion of the world.
ls she going with us?
Somebody"s gotta record this historic
event.
Let"s get going.
Her father owns the New York Globe.
All right, everybody. Let"s make a pretty
picture.
Smile.
Come on. Smile..
Now what?
Trust me..
Boss, these elephants are busting my
rump.
Stop complaining.
We could be back in Cairo on camels.
Where did you get the haircut, the army?
No. l"m a sailor.
l"ll tell you what...you look like you"re
in pretty good shape.
Who knows? Maybe you"d make a good
fighter.
That"s the way to earn some money.
Pretty lady.
My aching rump.
Elephants.
From now on in, it"s horses.
l"m going to go for a walk..
Be careful.
You"ve taken one.
Funeral.
No headstones.
That"s how they bury thieves here.
lt makes them give back to the earth.
What do you drink with tonic?
No me lo digas.
Gin.
l said, don"t tell me.
Shut up, you!
The Americans.
Welcome to our humble inn.
Thank you.
What the hell is this?
Fresh-killed cobra, champ.
l always say...
...one should never eat on an empty
stomach.
l"m for that.
lsn"t this a small world.
Khao,my old friend...
l just realized Y owed you some money.
You didn"t pay him?
No, he didn"t pay me. He"s a thief. l"m
used to him.
But you...you are worse.
You will dare to go to the Ghan-gheng to
fight against us...
...after we"ve trained you in the ways of
the Muay Thai warrior?
You got it all wrong, pops. He ain"t
gonna fight, Y am.
That is correct. This is Maxie Devine, the champ.
You are a fighter?
What are you talking about? What the
hell"s going on here?
As l was saying...
...before we were so rudely interrupted
by Mr. Khao...
Excuse me, honorable sir, we need this
table.
So do we.
You"re heard him. Now beat it.
l said...
l said, do you speak English?
He knows what you"re saying.
Hey, pal, scram.
Easy, kid. lt ain"t worth it.
What the hell is this?
That"s what you"ll face at the Ghan-geng.
Good morning, champ.
Good morning, my ass.
Do you think l was born yesterday?
You don"t have anything to do with this
damn Ghan-gheng, do you?
And you"re no valet either.
You"re nothing but a cheap, lying punk.
Take it easy.
You ain"t no fighter either.
You wouldn"t last one round in a real
fight. What do you think of that?
You want some?
Come on. Come on!
No more.
ls this what you"re after?
So what are you looking so glum about?
--
--
This is Maxie Devine, champion of
America.
Welcome to Ghan-ghen.
Kishu Yama... from Japan.
Phang Prahan of Siam.
l am Phang.
Maxie Devine of America.
That"s me.
Maxie Devine, heavyweight champion of
the world.
This man is a better fighter than me.
As the former heavyweight champion.
Y turn my title over to him.
This here"s your man. Christopher Dubois.
Dubois will be granted a chance to
prove...
...if he is a worthy combatant in the
first round.
lf not, Maxie Devine shall pay the
penalty...
...and never leave the Lost City.
That thing is bigger than l thought.
Why did you come back?
l"ve been champion a long time...
...and you beat me with your legs and
with your speed.
Besides, when l got the invitation to
come here...
...l decided l was gonna see the American
flag flying at the end of this thing.
l don"t know what"s on your mind...
...but do know a champion when l meet
one.
l"m here to see that you fight like one.
Now you know why.
Here in the Lost City at the top of the
world...
...we greet our first heroes.
ln this mystical arena, there are no
masks...
...just truth.
l wish yo well.
Soviet Union against Spain.
Japan against Okinawa.
France against Brazil.
China against Korea.
He can move in like an animal.
More like a snake.
Our little pension fund.
How come there ain"t nobody watchin this
thing?
Because they don"t think anybody could
lift it.
How are you feeling?
The kid"s a winner.
Of course he is. At least for one round.
l mean, for your sake.
After all, you don"t want to become a
permanent resident of the Lost City, do you?
You should be in training.
l know you"re gonna win the first round.
You"re gonna win the whole thing.
Are you gonna split the prize with them?
We have a deal..
So do we.
Turkey against Scotland.
Siam against Africa.
Germany against United States.
l don"t know about you...
...but plan on seeing Times Square again.
He"s outclassed.
Hope you enjoy Christmas in the Lost
City.
New York City!
Mongolia against Greece.!
This guy is no big deal.
Japan against Turkey.
Now he"s got a style like a monkey.
Mongolia against Siam.
lt"s over. Hit the gong!
Sit down!
We need a little chat.
Tomorrow you are throwing the fight.
Taking a dive. A plunge, kid.
lt is the perfect setup.
That dragon is so bloody enormous...
...if we"re going to lift it up, we need
you healthy.
Let"s face it, you have been lucky
o far.
Why the log face?
l thought this was your quest, your
dream.
Soon it will be your reality.
l think the kid needs some rest.
Sleep well.
Spain against United States.
Get up. Get up.
How about that? The kid can really take
a beating.
lt"s time for plan B.
What"s plan B?
Semifinal. Mongolia against Japan.
The winner"s gonna wear himself out.
Then he"ll roll right over for you.
This is good.
Lucky punch.
Secure it.
Semi-final.!
United States against China.
A tiger..
Harry it up. l can"t hold this forever.
ls it secure?
What about me?
Come on. Let"s get out of here.
You bastard! What about me?
l"ll see you outside the gate.
Trust me, Harry.
Dobbs, we got company.
Run for it, Harry!
What a mess.
l"m sorry we tried to run out on you.
l guess that"s the diference between us.
l never ever said l was sorry before and
meant it.
And l never ever had a quest that wasn"t
for me...
...number one.
Y wasn"t always a pirate, you know?
Believe it or not, for over twenty years
l was a genuine Captain...
...ln the Royal Navy.
l raised the Union Jack in countries you
never even herad of.
Fought the hun in the great war. For
what?
For the glory of God, the British Empire
and his majesty the king.
And when it was all over, what was l left
with?
You win some, you lose some.
You just watch your tail, my old son.
These men have committed a great
sacrilege...
...against this competition.
Let it be known that the price for such
betrayal... .
...is death..
l will pay for their freedom.
l brought them here.
lt"s may fault.
lf l win, they"ll go free.
You will keep the dragon.
This is for good.
So be it.
Final event.
Mongolia...
... against United States.
Cover up!
Come on.
We"re dead, Dobbs. We"re dead.
l won"t say it again, Harry, shut up.
Chris, give yourself some room!
Boss, this don"t sound good.
lt don"t sound good at all.
At least while they"re shouting. lt means
he"s still alive.
You got him. Now get in there and finish
him.
Go!
Come on!
He"s done it!
lt"s all right, kid. You did it.
Christopher Dubois, se honor you as the
greatest warrior of the Ghan-gheng.
Way to go, champ.
Thanks.
Now that you"re the undisputed champion,
l"ve been thinking...
About what?
A plan. A perfect plan.
l don"t think he wants to hear about it
now.
l didn"t get the golden dragon...
...but returned to New York like Y
promised.
Got the kids off the streets.
ln the end, we all did just fine.
Maxie trained many great fighters and
became a big celebrity.
Last l heard, Dobbs and Harry...
...opened a trading post deep in the
Amazon.
Bless their souls.
