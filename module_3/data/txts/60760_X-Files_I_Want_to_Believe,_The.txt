FBI AGENT: Keep it straight!
Come on, straight!
(WOMAN CHATTERING ON RADIO)
FBI AGENT: Stay together!
Keep it tight!
(DOG CONTINUES BARKING)
Give him room!
Hold the line, gentlemen!
Look left! Look right!
Hold the line!
It's here. It's here.
Hey! Calm down, Buddy! Hey!
WHITNEY: Let him go!
Let him go! Let him go!
Let him go! Let him go!
(PANTING)
WHITNEY: Easy, easy. Let him go!
Let him go! Let him go!
No!
Here! Here! It's here!
(AGENTS CLAMORING)
It's here!
I've gone over the charts you've sent
and consuIted
another pediatric neuroIogist
who works with me here.
We're aIarmed by two things.
SCULLY: The deficiency in lipid metabolism
and the severely diminished
enzyme output.
Right. That's exactIy right.
Both indicate lysosomal storage illness.
You're the boy's primary physician,
Doctor...
Scully. Dana Scully.
And you tested his Iysosome function?
I think you have
all my results there, Doctor.
My fear is that it's a type-two
degenerative brain disease
like Sandhoff disease,
that his enzymes aren't clearing
the lipids from his brain, causing atrophy.
If you suspect Sandhoff disease,
I'd test the boy's IeveIs of hexosaminidase.
I've done that. What I'm looking for here,
Doctor, is a course of treatment.
There is no treatment for Sandhoff.
But if there were, I'm sure you'd teII me.
-Hi, Christian, how are you feeling?
-Okay, Dr. Scully. How are you?
Me? Well, I'm doing just fine, thank you.
You got some outside opinions?
Yes. We're gonna do some more tests.
Dana Scully?
Dr. Scully, I'm looking for Fox Mulder.
Excuse me.
-Special Agent Drummy with...
-I can guess who you're with.
The FBI urgently needs
to speak with Fox Mulder.
I don't work with Fox Mulder any longer.
I don't work with the FBI.
Well, if you could contact him,
it might just save the life of an FBI agent.
MULDER: What's up, Doc?
You've become awfully trusting, Mulder.
For a man wanted by the FBI.
Eyes in the back of my head, Scully.
"Auf einer WeIIenIänge,"
as the Germans say.
It's a precognitive state often confused
with simple human intuition,
in which the brain perceives the deep logic
underlying transitory human existence,
unaided by the conscious mind,
materializing much as you did just now.
Though, if you'd actually materialized,
you'd be rapidly dematerializing.
But who believes that crap anymore?
Well, they do at the FBI, apparently.
I had a visitor today, Mulder.
The FBI wants your help
finding a missing agent.
Well, I hope you told them
to go screw themselves.
They say all is forgiven.
That they'll drop all charges against you
if you come in
and help them solve this case.
The FBI will forgive me?
They put me on trial on bogus charges
and tried to discredit
a decade of my work. They should
be asking me for my forgiveness, Scully.
I think they are. Desperately.
How can I possibly help these people?
Someone's come forward
with some promising evidence.
A psychic, he claims.
Oh.
It's a trick, Scully, to smoke me out.
Mulder, if the FBI wanted to get you,
I have no doubt that they could.
I think they've just been happy
to have you out of their hair.
Well, good. Because I am just as happy
having them out of mine.
A young agent's life is at stake.
Mulder, I know I don't have to say this,
but it could have been you once.
Or me.
You know, the truth is, I worry about you
and the effects of long-term isolation.
(CHUCKLING) I'm fine here.
I'm happy as a clam.
I'll tell them your answer.
Shit.
Okay, I'll go.
Under one condition.
(SIGHS)
(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)
Thanks for the lift.
Don't thank me. I didn't send it.
Wait here.
Come in.
Excuse me. They're here.
Thanks for making this happen.
I'm Special Agent in Charge Whitney.
-Dana Scully.
-Fox Mulder, I believe?
I know this is awkward,
but welcome back.
My team and I appreciate your trust.
Well, trust being what it is,
what if I can't help you?
Or your agent turns up dead?
The past is the past.
I know your work on X-Files cases here
and believe
you may be the best chance
Monica Bannan has now.
-How long has she been missing?
-WHITNEY: Since Sunday evening.
Almost three days.
I know you know this, but after 72 hours,
there's slim chance that she's still alive.
We have slim reason to believe she is.
But so far,
we've got no evidence to the contrary,
and the facts give us hope.
Soon after she goes missing,
we find this, a severed arm.
-Where?
-About 1 0 miles from her home.
I don't understand. It's a man's arm.
It's a match for evidence found at
or near the crime scene. Blood or tissue?
Blood. Found in her garage
and on the tool that matches the wound.
-I take it you were led to it.
-Like a needle in a haystack.
By someone claiming psychic powers.
Joseph Fitz patrick Crissman.
-And you think he's full of shit.
-What makes you say that?
Psychic.
-Father Joe was...
-SCULLY: Father?
-He was a priest?
-Catholic.
He cold-called six hours after
Monica Bannan was reported missing,
claiming a vision of her.
A psychic connection.
-And he tells you she's alive?
-That's right.
Have you found any other connection?
-To Monica Bannan?
-No. That's why I sent for you.
I need to know we're not wasting time.
Well, he's a religious man,
clearly educated man.
He took right action,
said nothing to cast doubt upon himself,
has no material connection to the crime.
You are wasting time,
only it's mine and your agents'.
There's a question of credibility.
If you have no reason to doubt the man,
why doubt the man's visions?
He didn't lead us to Monica Bannan.
He gave us a guy's bloody arm
in the snow.
This is not an exact science.
If it were me, I'd be on the guy 24/7.
I'd be in bed with him, kissing his holy ass.
(CLEARS THROAT) Father Joe's
a convicted pedophile.
Maybe I'd stay out of bed with him.
What is this?
-Dorms for habitual sex offenders.
-Dorms?
They manage the complex
and police themselves.
Father Joe lives here voluntarily
with his roommate.
Just avoid the activities room.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
MAN: Joe?
FATHER JOE: Tell them to come in.
(MOVIN' ON UP PLAYING)
WOMAN, (SINGING)
Fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the griII
Took a whoIe Iotta trying
Just to get up that hiII
DRUMMY: Father Joe?
Now we're up in the big Ieagues
Getting our turn at bat
As Iong as we Iive, it's you and me baby
Excuse the mess. I haven't been sleeping.
There ain't nothing wrong with that...
DRUMMY: Father Joe, this is Fox Mulder.
-Okay.
-He'd like to ask some questions.
Actually, I'd like to ask something.
What was it
you were praying for in there, sir?
For the salvation of my immortal soul.
-And do you think God hears your prayers?
-Do you think he hears yours?
I didn't bugger 37 altar boys.
Oh.
-That's a colorful way of putting it.
-I have another word, if you'd like.
MULDER: I'm sure you do.
I have to believe he does hear me,
or why would he send these visions?
Maybe it's not God doing the sending.
You call them visions. You see them?
In what you might call my mind's eye.
What do you see?
(SIGHS)
I see the poor girl being assaulted.
I see her putting up a fight.
I hear dogs barking.
Where?
FATHER JOE: Can't tell.
-But you see her alive.
-No, but I... I feel that she is.
Can you show us how you do it?
(COUGHS)
I don't know that I can do this right now.
Maybe it'd be better if she wasn't here.
Maybe what you see is
a way to try and make people
forget what it is that you really are.
(DOOR OPENING)
Jesus, Mulder.
So much for kissing his holy ass.
I'm sorry.
I've been too long away from
this business, or not long enough.
No, you were good in there.
All I had were questions.
But you pushed him, challenged him.
Like old times.
Yeah, well, he's a creep and a liar.
He knows who did this, and they're
supplying him with information.
I mean, look where he lives.
And this arm they found?
This wasn't severed in any fight.
It was cut cleanly, chopped off.
And tell me how he's been able
to lead them straight to it
and not even muster a guess
as to where the victim is.
Two things you're gonna find
in the next 24 hours,
a dead agent, and that this guy
Father Joe is a big fat fraud.
You could be right, Scully.
You could be right.
(DOOR OPENS)
But what if you're wrong?
-What are you doing?
-Gonna take him for a ride.
See just how psychic
this Father Joe really is.
Yeah, well, it's been fun.
Scully? Nobody's going to
make you sit next to him.
Thanks, but I've already
been taken for a ride.
Anyway, he doesn't want me there.
-I want you here.
-This isn't my life anymore, Mulder.
I'm done chasing monsters in the dark.
I think you've done
all they've asked of you here, too.
You know, no one says
you have to stay here.
These people need my help.
(SCOFFS)
And I could really use yours.
(FATHER JOE SIGHS)
-Are we getting warm?
-You tell us.
I don't know if I have a clue where we are.
That's all right.
Everybody works differently.
What are you, the good cop?
I'm a non-cop.
I don't know this girl.
This Agent Bannan of yours,
I haven't a clue the connection.
There's always something, however small.
And who made you the expert?
I once investigated a series of cases
involving unexplained phenomena
for the FBI.
So you believe in these sort of things?
Let's just say I want to believe.
And his sister was abducted by E.T.
Is that true?
It was a long time ago.
She's dead, isn't she? Your sister.
This is where she was taken. Your agent,
this is where she was attacked.
I want him to see the crime scene.
No, it's... This isn't right.
You've brought me to the wrong house.
Pulled that right out of his ass.
There were news crews
out here covering the scene.
Pictures of the neighborhood.
He could have recognized it all from TV.
Yeah, but why?
-Why?
-Why do it?
Why go to such great lengths
to create such an elaborate fiction?
Expiation. Forgiveness of his sins.
He's written dozens of letters
to the Vatican,
pleading reengagement with the Church.
Rather odd way to impress the Holy See.
Voice of God speaking through a man?
I think that's been a winner a few times.
So you think he's guilty, too, huh?
We have to consider him a suspect.
But you've found
no connection to the crime.
Don't think my guys have stopped looking.
And they think they're gonna find one.
Yeah, but you don't, or I wouldn't be here.
Yeah, I'm not the most popular girl
at the FBI right now
for calling you in, believe me.
Yeah. I wasn't exactly Miss Popularity
at the FBI myself.
But you've dealt with psychics before.
Luther Lee Boggs,
Clyde Bruckman, Gerald Schnauz.
I went through those cases,
and that work was extremely impressive.
Yeah, well, I'm only half the team.
But it's your insights I need.
She ran away. She tried to escape.
There were two men.
But she couldn't. He pushed her down.
It was here. It was right here.
And then they put her in the back.
-Where?
-In the car. No.
It was a truck,
a truck with something on it, like a...
-We have to find her!
-She's in pain. Great, great pain.
-Tell me where!
-I don't know! I can't see!
-We need to find her!
-(SOBBING) I can't see! I can't see!
'Cause he's pulling it out of his ass.
Father Joe?
Hi, Christian.
You're looking
very bright-eyed this morning.
-I was thinking.
-Yeah? What were you thinking?
How I'm going to get out of here.
Well, you know,
I'm thinking exactly the same thing.
Can I get out of here soon?
What's wrong? Has something scared you?
The way the man is looking at me.
What man?
Don't be afraid.
I was just looking for those.
I wanted to go over them myself
and the results of
the new tests that you ordered.
That isn't really your purview, Father.
It's his primary physician's.
It is in my purview
to make sure that all my physicians
are making the right choices
for their patients and for the hospital.
Can I have the test results, please?
We are here to heal the sick,
not prolong the ordeal of the dying.
There are other,
better facilities for the boy.
(CLATTERING)
(SPLASHING)
(ENGINE REVVING)
(MEMORlES CHlLD PLAYING ON RADIO)
Whoa!
Hey, hey. Hey!
Ow!
(GASPING WEAKLY)
I'm okay. I'm fine.
(SCREAMS)
(WHEELS SPINNING)
(WOLVES HOWLING)
MULDER: I can feel you thinking.
I'm sorry. I can't sleep.
Actually, I have a little something for that.
-Just a little something?
-Thank you.
What's the matter?
(SCULLY EXHALES)
I have a patient,
a young boy with a rare brain disease,
and he's very, very sick.
Why haven't you
told me about this before?
I thought there was something I could do.
There's not?
Well, there's radical treatments,
but nobody wants to talk about those.
Even the experts say
there's nothing to be done.
Nothing but...
Nothing but let him die.
(SIGHS)
So I'm lying here,
cursing God for all his cruelties.
And do you think God is losing any sleep?
Why bring a kid into the world
just to make him suffer?
I don't know, Mulder.
I've got such a connection to this boy.
How old is he?
You think it's because of William.
I think our son left us both
with an emptiness that can't be filled.
Just go to sleep.
Let me curse God for a while.
Thank you.
Scratchy beard.
(LAUGHING)
SCULLY: Oh...
MULDER: Hmm?
There was something weird on
the toxicology report of the severed arm.
What?
I looked over
the FBI evidence reports again.
And in the tissue
there were traces of a drug
that's commonly given to patients
being treated with radiation.
MULDER: Mmm-hmm.
And also traces of a drug
called acepromazine.
Why is that weird?
Acepromazine is an animal tranquilizer.
(MULDER SIGHS)
Now I can't sleep.
Mulder?
What is animal tranquilizer doing
in the tissue sample
of a man's severed arm?
I can't even begin to speculate.
He said he heard barking dogs.
-Who?
-Father Joe.
Mulder, what are you doing?
Is it a tranquilizer
that you might give a dog?
He's a phony, Mulder.
He pulls these so-called visions
out of thin air,
and now he's got you
straining to connect them.
When I see a man cry tears of blood
at a crime scene he recognizes
without ever having visited,
I need to go out on a limb.
You know what I'm saying?
Tears of blood?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Yeah. Some trick, huh?
How do you fake that?
-Hello?
-DRUMMY, HeIIo, Dr. ScuIIy?
-Yes.
-I have Dakota Whitney for you.
Can you hold on a second?
I'm sorry to call at this hour.
-Has there been a break?
-They find her?
We're pursuing another Iead.
The same source?
Same source, new news.
It's here. It's here.
Turn up ahead, at the barn.
WHITNEY: One more time. Ten minutes!
-Did you find her?
-No.
-What did you do?
-What?
Oh.
You said there was news.
The news is our psychic led us to
the exact same site he led us to before.
You're going to find it.
That's what you keep saying.
You're going to find a body.
-You keep telling us she's alive.
-She is.
We could do this all night.
These guys are all running on empty.
I'm sorry for bringing you out here.
DRUMMY: Hey! Let's go, fellows!
Bring it in! Let's go!
Bring it in, gentlemen!
Time to go home!
Tell me. Tell me what you see.
I see a face.
I see eyes staring out.
Who? Who is it?
It's unclear.
Like through dirty glass.
It's out there. I know it.
Scully, what does he mean,
"like through dirty glass"?
-Mulder.
-What?
Stop.
Okay, just feel free to give up
like everybody else.
This is not my job anymore, Mulder.
No, that's right. That's right. You're
just like my booking agent now, right?
You're right. This is my fault.
(SCOFFS) What do you mean,
it's your fault?
For getting you involved in this.
No. No. It was the right thing to do, Scully.
This is not about finding an FBI agent!
This is about you
trying to save your sister.
My sister is dead.
It hasn't stopped you from looking for her.
Mulder, I have been through this
too many years with you,
believing you can save her.
You cannot save her,
not now, and not ever.
I'm going to need those men back!
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to ignore you.
This is it! Here it is!
This is it.
We need shovels.
It's solid ice.
No. It's dirty glass.
Flashlight?
You're going to need resources.
WHITNEY: We need equipment!
Concrete saws and a backhoe!
DRUMMY: You two get on the line.
You two come with me.
Don't give up.
(DOGS BARKING)
(SOBBING) Please! Get me out of here!
Help! Help!
Let me out of here!
(WHISPERING) Please, please, I won't tell.
I won't tell anyone.
I won't tell anyone. Just let me go.
I just want to go home.
I'm sorry I hit your truck.
I didn't mean to do it. I didn't mean
to hit your truck. I didn't mean to.
(MEN SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
Wait, wait!
(CRYING) Where are you taking me?
Where?
What is this place? Who are you?
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
(CLATTERING)
(WHISPERING) Please,
will you just get me out of here?
Get up.
(GROANING)
I can help you. Just get me out of here.
Help!
I think we can resolve, then,
in good conscience and without objection,
to relocate the patient to a facility
suited for and humane to his condition.
(WHISPERING) Sorry.
As you and I discussed, Dr. Scully,
I was just informing the staff and doctors
of the hospital's decision
on Christian Fearon.
I'm sorry. What decision?
To relocate the patient to a hospice
who will manage his palliative care.
That was a discussion, not a decision.
Well, it's been discussed here at length,
with no objection from your colleagues.
I have an objection.
You have, Dr. Scully,
a patient with an untreatable condition.
Now, that's very sad and unfortunate.
Nobody disagrees with that.
But he's my patient.
And unless you've come here today
with a cure for Sandhoff disease,
we all ask that you let the boy go in peace.
Thank you.
Now I'd like to wrap up
so we can get on to the day's good work.
We have the final matter of a patient
in intensive care,
Dr. Willar's patient, I believe.
Admitted after suffering
myocardial infarction...
There is a treatment.
The matter is resolved, Dr. Scully.
No, it's not.
The disease can be treated
with intrathecal stem cell therapy.
You're not serious.
Don't put the boy through hell.
Would you do it if it was your son?
It's not her son, and he's not yours.
And it's not a decision for hospital
administration. It's his doctor's.
If you would like to challenge that,
you can take the matter up
with a higher authority.
I have taken it up with
the highest authority, Dr. Scully.
As should you.
(TOOLS WHIRRING)
Come on, pick up.
Come on.
Come on, answer.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
This is Dana ScuIIy.
PIease Ieave a message.
Hey, Scully, it's me.
I keep leaving you messages.
Here's what I want to tell you.
That woman's head in the ice, it's not
the agent's. It's not Monica Bannan's.
We don't know who she is
or why she's there, but so far
we've pulled 1 1 discrete human limbs
from the ice,
and we're not even done yet.
Each one a clean cut, too.
An exact match to the previous
amputation you noted, ScuIIy.
It Iooks Iike someone's
been dumping body parts
in the ice there for months, possibIy years.
And there seems to be
no pattern to the Iimbs.
Men and women,
aII with heaIthy, undiseased tissue,
according to forensics.
Which suggests to me
that they are victims.
But here's the thing,
what I need you to know.
We found more traces of your
animal tranquilizer, acepromazine.
I don't know what the hell it means,
but I'm hoping you can make sense of it.
-Anything?
-No, I can't reach her.
But this is gonna make sense.
This is a break. I'm feeling it.
Mmm-hmm. You're feeling it.
Father Joe is feeling it.
All I'm feeling is my head spinning.
No, this is a serial case
you've uncovered here.
You're gonna solve a dozen murders here.
Yes, but I'm no closer to finding my agent.
No, we're gonna find her. I know it.
Well, she may have to stand in line.
I see a woman's face.
Another woman. Taken from a car.
She's being held in a box, I think.
Is she with Monica Bannan?
-I don't know.
-Is it the same men that took her?
I think so. Yes. It's the same men.
You see this, or are you just telling
these people what they want to hear?
-No!
-No, you don't see it?
No, it's the same men.
I want a car ready.
-To go where?
-I don't know yet.
-I don't believe this.
-That's been your problem from the start.
I can get you a car.
And a list of missing persons
in the greater area
over the last 48 to 72 hours.
-WHITNEY: Hi.
-Hi, how's it going?
Cheryl Cunningham, 34,
never made it to work last night.
No show at home, either.
There's no blood on the airbags.
Driver's side window knocked out.
Keys in the ignition.
Survivable crash with a seatbelt.
She sets off, takes a shortcut,
gets tired, sits down, falls asleep.
-Happens all the time.
-Pretty hard left turn for such a long,
straight stretch of country road,
don't you think?
But why settle for my opinion?
I'm sorry. I'm not getting anything.
What a surprise. What a surprise.
-I think we're done with Father Joe.
-Yeah.
MULDER: Whoa, whoa.
-We're not quite finished.
-What is that?
It's a medical ID bracelet. I noticed
your missing agent wore one, too.
-For what?
-What are you thinking?
Let's pop the trunk.
-This isn't gonna do her much good.
-Here's a gym bag.
It's a bathing suit. It's frozen stiff.
-Chlorine.
-Where's the nearest public pool?
Hi. We're hoping you can help us.
-Would you all like lockers?
-No, we're with the FBI.
We'd like to show you a photo, sir,
if you don't mind.
Why would I mind?
-Do you know this person?
-Let me see.
These young people
look so much the same.
-WHITNEY: You have a sign-in register?
-Yes, I keep one every day.
-I'd like to see yesterday's.
-I threw yesterday's away.
Excuse me, sir. Doesn't he know
that's the woman's side?
Hi, Christian.
You've got a whole bunch of people taking
really good care of you today, okay?
What?
Now you look scared.
(SAW WHIRRING)
People say I went underground.
I'm sorry, Mulder.
I've had to keep my focus here.
It's the boy, isn't it?
Yeah.
I thought there was nothing to be done.
I'm taking a big chance on something,
on a radical
and extremely painful new procedure.
Last night you said that wasn't an option.
It wasn't, last night.
What changed your mind?
(SIGHING)
When will you know if it's working?
There's a series of these procedures,
and we won't know until they're all done.
But that's not what
you came to talk about.
There's another woman missing.
She's given us something to go on.
She and the missing agent
swam at the same pool.
We found that the agent kept
a locker there.
We think they were stalked there.
Both women wore a medical ID bracelet,
and they both had the same
rare blood type, AB negative.
Organs harvested for transplant.
That's how they were targeted.
Donors and recipients need
matched types.
Someone using that pool knows that.
Black market. Somebody filling orders.
Well, they have access.
Recipients, hospitals...
That's your world, Scully.
Your knowledge of it will save time,
and time is our enemy.
You can start with the transporters.
Call the Richmond DA.
No, no, no, I need you on this with me.
No. No, Mulder.
Yeah, yeah. You asked for me
to get involved, Scully.
Now I'm asking for you to stay involved.
Oh, Mulder.
You helped them already.
You broke the case for them.
Why don't you just let the FBI pursue it?
We're so close now.
-And I'm asking you to let it go.
-It's not that simple.
(SOFTLY) No. It's complicated.
What's that supposed to mean?
Something that I knew would happen,
that I've been afraid of,
that I haven't had to face until now.
What? Just say it.
I'm a doctor, Mulder.
-That's not my life anymore.
-I know that.
You're not understanding me.
I can't look into the darkness
with you anymore, Mulder.
I cannot stand what it does to you,
or to me.
I'm fine with it, Scully.
I'm actually okay. I'm good.
Yeah, that's what scares me.
Where else would you have me look
if you want me to find these women alive?
I'm asking you to look at yourself.
Why?
I don't think I'm the one who's changed.
We're not FBI anymore, Mulder.
We are two people
who come home at night,
to a home now.
I don't want that darkness in my home.
Scully, this is who I am.
It's who I've always been.
This is who I was before I met you.
It's what I do. It's everything I know.
Write it down. Put it in a book.
Are you asking me to give up?
No.
I can't tell you to do that, Mulder.
But I can tell you that
I won't be coming home.
Scully.
(SIGHS)
Mulder, I've got my own battles to fight.
-Don't do this.
-Please don't argue with me.
Don't do this now.
I don't know what else to do.
Well, good luck, then.
(DOOR CLOSES SOFTLY)
(SOFTLY) You, too.
MRS. FEARON: Dr. Scully?
We'd like to speak with you if we may,
about Christian.
-Have you been in to see him?
-Yes. He was sleeping. But we've...
We've changed our minds about
going forward with this new treatment.
But you don't even know
if it's working yet.
We think that Christian's
been through enough.
We want to put our faith in God now.
-I see.
-MRS. FEARON: It's nothing against you.
No.
If you were a mother, you'd understand.
Have you spoken to Father Ybarra?
Yes. But the decision is ours.
What if it did work?
What if we found
we'd made the wrong choice by stopping?
You're saying you can save my son?
I'm saying I don't want to give up now.
But, lo and behold,
when we were about to hit the tarmac,
and all of a sudden the plane gears up,
and we're back up in the air again.
I say, "Honey, isn't this fantastic?
We're going to die together."
Turns out there was a plane
parked on the tarmac
and we missed colliding with it
by seconds.
But we were in love, and it was romantic.
Sir? Excuse me, sir?
Can we talk with you a minute?
(WITH RUSSIAN ACCENT)
I'm transporting vital organ.
That's what we'd like to talk to you about.
This is my job. I move very quickly.
I don't have much time.
Please, sir. Step over here.
My name is Robert Koell. I'm with the
District Attorney's office in Richmond.
-May I see your paperwork and license?
-I have green card.
-What are you transporting?
-Human liver for transplantation.
Paper work and license, please.
Where are you delivering it?
Willow's Memorial Hospital.
They're expecting it there.
A patient wait for it.
Have you ever procured or delivered
an organ outside of
normal or lawful channels?
No.
You're an employee with this company.
How would your employer
answer this question?
He's sick. Has cancer.
That's not what I asked you.
Am I under some kind of suspicion?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
A vision, if ever I had one.
May I speak with you?
Would you like to come in?
Make yourself comfortable.
I won't be staying long.
Have you come here by yourself?
Yes.
Sit.
Please, I insist.
Now, you came to ask something.
(CLATTERING OUTSIDE)
We're alone. Free to speak in confidence.
You said something to me
the other night in the snow.
Yes. I said, "Don't give up."
I need to know why you said that.
I haven't the faintest idea.
Were you hoping for another answer?
Do you know anything about me?
Other than that you loathe me?
Do you know what it is that I do?
No. I can see you're a woman of faith.
But not in the same things
as your husband.
He's not my husband.
-Do you care to tell me about yourself?
-No!
Do you care to offer a confession?
-I don't think you're...
-What?
In a position to judge?
And yet you've judged me, haven't you?
You deserve to be judged.
Do you know why we live here,
the men who call
this vile box of monsters home?
Because we hate each other,
even as we hate ourselves,
for our sickening appetites.
That doesn't make it any less sickening.
And where do they come from,
these appetites,
these uncontrollable urges of ours?
Not from God.
Not from me.
I castrated myself when I was 26.
And the visions weren't my idea, either!
-Proverbs 25:2.
-What?
God's glory to conceal a thing,
but the honor of kings
to search out a matter.
Don't you quote Scripture to me!
What are you doing here?
What are you afraid of?
"Don't give up"! What was that for?
-I don't know!
-I don't believe you!
I'm telling you the truth!
-They were your words!
-I don't know why I said them.
You said them to my face!
All I ever wanted was to serve him.
All I've ever wanted
was to serve God.
You can ask for his pity,
but don't expect mine.
You can stop the act anytime!
Look at me!

SCULLY: Paramedics are here now.
They've been here
for about seven minutes.
Yeah, he's stabilized.
Blood pressure's normal.
-No, they're loading him in now.
-What happened?
Thank you. He had a seizure.
-Who called you?
-No one.
Then what are you doing here?
We need to talk to Father Joe.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
We've got a suspect. A Russian émigré
working as an organ transporter.
-In custody?
-No.
The Richmond DA questioned him about
trafficking black market human organs
this afternoon, but he was released.
They had no evidence to hold him.
We've got a fairly credible witness
who says
he swam with the women at the pool.
ASAC Whitney?
-Excuse me.
-What's that got to do with Father Joe?
-It's the man in his visions, Scully.
-Who?
The suspect. The man in this photo.
Mulder, now you're wasting their time.
Tell me again what you're doing here.
Here's a vision for you.
A couple of my guys just had it.
MULDER: Who's this?
That's our suspect's employer. An old
friend of Father Joe's, we just learned.
-Known him over 20 years.
-Known him how?
That's one of his 37 altar boys.
Three guesses who he's married to
in the state of Massachusetts.
Our suspect.
We got a warrant to search their offices.
Mulder.
It's over.
-Hey! Hey!
-What?
-Hey!
-Mulder!
(AMBULANCE SIREN WAILING)
Why don't you hold up?
Let these men do theirjobs.
Clear this bottom floor.
We were all fooled on this.
I wanted to believe it as bad as anyone.
Look, I don't need the sweet talk.
-You led us here.
-Father Joe led us here.
This is Special Agent Drummy
with the FBI!
We have warrants to search these offices!
Anyone inside, identify yourself
and unlock the door now!
I called you in because I thought
you could help me with this case,
because I valued your belief
in these phenomena.
Now what do you think?
I think this is a longer conversation.
DRUMMY: Down on the floor!
Down on the floor!
Anybody here, I want down on the floor!
Somebody find the lights.
We were at a complete standstill
and you pushed us forward,
no matter the direction we took.
Hey!
WHITNEY: Hey!
(HORN HONKING)
DRIVER: What are you, nuts?
Hey! Stop him!
MAN 1 : Hey! You can't go there!
MAN 2: Whoa! Hey!
(CLATTERING)
-Quick! Which way did they go?
-Down that way!
-Mulder!
-I'm up here!
Mulder!
He's coming at you!
Hey!
-Mulder!
-Yeah!
-Where are you?
-Right here.
Where?
(GROANS IN DISGUST)
Fox!
-Where is he? Do you have him?
-No. I lost him.
-I saw him.
-Where?
(SCREAMS)
They're both dead.
Monica Bannan and Dakota Whitney.
I heard. I'm sorry.
Yeah, well...
I thought we were winning, Scully.
I know you did, Mulder.
I'm here to see Father Joe.
I want to show him
these photographs of these men.
You still want to believe him.
I think you should know that he's been
diagnosed with a terminal illness.
He has advanced-stage lung cancer.
I just want to be sure.
Then let me ask him.
You wouldn't believe...
I was thinking of you.
I had a vision you might find interesting.
Of a man speaking a foreign language.
Did he happen to look like this?
Yeah. That's the man. How did you know?
We think he's the man
who abducted the FBI agent
and the second woman that
you say you saw, and possibly many more.
And we think that he was helped
by this man.
-I don't know who that is.
-Are you sure?
I'm fairly certain. I don't know him.
I'm fairly certain that you do.
And that you've known him
since he was a boy.
Oh, no.
It can't be true.
I don't believe this.
He was my connection to the girl.
My visions were to save her from him.
This is God's work.
Let me ask you one more question,
Father Joe.
(SIGHS)
The FBI agent,
the first woman that you saw,
Monica Bannan,
is she still alive?
I feel her.
Yes.
She's still alive.
-Mulder.
-That second victim may be alive.
Everybody's given up on her,
but I'm not going to.
Mulder, you think I don't understand,
but I do.
This stubbornness of yours,
it's why I fell in love with you.
It's like you said.
That's why we can't be together.
(MAN SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN)
(BOTH ARGUING IN RUSSIAN)
(SHOUTING ANGRILY)
Whoa, hold up. Hey!
-Hey! Sorry to bother you.
-I'm closed!
No, I just need a moment of your time.
You know,
we got some bad weather coming in.
You better get where you're going fast.
So what do you need?
Yeah, I was wondering if you carry
an animal tranquilizer
called acepromazine.
-You got a prescription for it?
-No, I don't.
Well, I can't sell it to you, then.
Can you tell me if
you've ever sold any to this man?
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-I am never getting out of here.
-I'm just...
MAN: Nutter's Feed.
Yeah, I was just closing up
and I'm gonna pick him up.
Yeah. Goodbye. Yeah.
-What happened to the other guy?
-Who?
The guy who was standing right here.
I need to refill this now.
(SIGHS) Okay.
(DOGS BARKING)
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
-MULDER, Yeah, it's me.
-Shit.
I must be busy right now.
Leave a message.
MuIder, I just found something
in my stem ceII research.
Experiments being done
in Russia on dogs, MuIder.
I think that's what your suspects
have been doing, onIy on humans,
those women who've been abducted.
You've got to caII me.
Mulder, the FBI agent's alive.

Fossa speaking.

SCULLY, I've been trying
to find you for hours.
I can't reach Mulder.
-Is this Dr. Scully?
-Yes, it's Dr. ScuIIy.
-Well, where is he?
-If I knew that, I wouldn't be calling.
Dr. Scully,
I'm gonna suggest you call the police.
This is not an FBI matter.
Listen to me!
I need your help!
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Then let me talk to somebody there
with some balls who can.

I'm Dana Scully and that's my car.
Right. I talked to some bigwig down
at the FBI. Called from Washington.
Yeah. That's him. Walter Skinner.
Is there any indication what happened
or any footprints?
Nothing. Snow's pretty heavy.
But we did find this.
Might want to give it to him. Excuse me.
Here's his cell phone. It's got blood on it.
Hey, listen to me. Calm down.
Stop and think. He's okay.
He's got to be.
Now, he climbed out of there somehow.
And if he climbed out,
he probably climbed up.
(DOGS BARKING)

(STAFF CLAMORING IN RUSSIAN)

Do you speak English?

I want those tubes out of her neck,

Are you gonna do what I said?
(MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
(MULDER EXCLAIMS)
(GROANING)
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
(SCULLY SIGHS)
We will find him.
I know Mulder.
He'd get to a phone and call first.
He didn't do anything crazy.
Not overly crazy.
Wait a minute. Back up.
Just stop. Back up a sec.
Stop.
What is it?
Proverbs, 25:2.
The glory of God to hide a thing.
I've got it. It's an invoice for medical
supplies to a Dr. Uroff-Koltoff.
It's an address on Bellflower Road.
(DOGS BARKING)
Maybe I can Google it.
-Listen.
-What?
(BARKING CONTINUES)
Dogs. Dogs!
Hey!
(WHISPERING) Mulder.
Can you hear me?
Sorry about your car.
The girl is still inside.
(MAN SPEAKING URGENTLY IN RUSSIAN)
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
Put the scalpel down!

Put the scalpel down,
or I'll blow your goddamn hand off!
Get over there!
Oh, my God, what have you done?
What have you done?
Mulder needs warm clothes and fluids.
Oh, God.
I've got work to do here.
Get in! Get in there!
(PEOPLE CHATTERING IN RUSSIAN)
All right, Mulder.
The girl, inside...
Scully's got her. She's in good hands.
-Skinner?
-Yeah.
I'm cold.
I got you.
-Mulder?
-What's up, Doc?
Father Joe is dead.
He was clearly a very sick man.
Did you see this story?
The FBI is claiming
Father Joe was an accomplice.
Not a word about his psychic connection.
He's dead, Mulder. We'll never know.
I know, Scully, and I can prove it.
Father Joe died of lung cancer, right?
The same as that man Dr. Frankenstein
tried to give a new body.
Mulder.
And what time did you pull those tubes
from that woman's neck?
What time did you cut off
the blood supply to that man's head?
That's when Father Joe died.
You get me his death certificate
and I'll show it to you,
and then I'll take it to the FBI
and I'll show them.
Do you think
they're really gonna take your call?
It's an injustice to the man's name.
Well, considering his crimes
against those young boys,
who is really going to care?
I thought you believed him, too.
I wanted to believe him.
I did believe him. I acted on that belief.
Why don't you just tell me
what he said to you?
He told me,
"Don't give up."
And I didn't. And it saved your life.
(VOICE BREAKING) But I've put that boy
through hell.
And I have another surgery
scheduled for this morning
because I believed
that God was telling me to.
Through a pedophile priest, no less.
What if Father Joe's prayers
were answered after all?
What if he were forgiven
because he didn't give up?
Try proving that one, Mulder.
I'm due at the hospital.
Scully?
Why would he say that?
"Don't give up."
Why would he say such a thing to you?
I think that was
clearly meant for you, Mulder.
He didn't say it to me. He said it to you.
If Father Joe were the devil,
why would he say the opposite
of what the devil might say?
Maybe that's the answer.
You know, the larger answer.
What do you mean?
Don't give up.
Please don't make this
any harder than it already is.
It's okay. Okay.
(SOFTLY) If you have any doubts,
any doubts at all,
just call off that surgery this morning.
And then we'll get out of here.
Just me and you.
As far away from the darkness
as we can get?
I'm not sure it works that way.
I think maybe the darkness finds you,
and me.
I know it does.
But let it try.
(SIGHS)
Are you ready to begin, Dr. Scully?
Yes.
