Mom? Dad?
Al?
Hello?
Al?
Thunderbolt.
<i>Papa.</i>
<i>Papa.</i>
<i>Papa.</i>
Cut. Yeah, see?
Chain it to the tractor.
Okay. Bring her in.
- That's it.
- Be careful.
That's it.
Yeah, okay, now put those...
Yeah. Secure it over there.
Yeah, the other tree.
That's it. Tighten it up.
Okay. Up, up.
Go.
Whoa, move it.
Back it up, keep it going.
Back her up, that's it.
Hey, Terry,
what's that thing called again?
- A geode, a thunder egg.
- I don't think we should be doing this.
Hey, chill out. They'll never know.
- My dad will have a seizure.
- It's your own fault.
You should've called me
before they filled it in.
- Yeah, but...
- There's gotta be more down there.
And you know how much you can get
for a big one? A hundred bucks.
It smells like
something died in there.
- Looks like a cave.
- Wicked.
- Be careful.
- Here.
Jeez.
That's nothing.
What is it?
What the hell was that noise?
I don't think
we should be doing this.
Who cares? We're rich.
Come on.
Al, don't, wait a sec.
You promised I could have these.
I said that three months ago.
They've been sitting in my room.
But, Al...
Quit calling me Al.
My name is Alexandra.
Well, aren't we gonna launch them?
Well, you can do whatever you want.
I've gotta go.
Where? You promised
we could launch them.
I'm going shopping
with Lori and Linda.
The Lee sisters.
Al, wait.
What about the Thunderbolt?
Just forget about the Thunderbolt.
It's gone.
What do you need her for, anyway?
I mean, what's the big deal?
Well, ever since
I burnt a hole on the roof...
...my dad says I can't launch
any of my rockets without supervision.
Hey, I'll supervise.
Hey. You guys, wait for me.
Come on.
Get into the car.
- What are those for?
- Live cargo.
Forget it. It got wet in the trash.
Totaled.
How long do you think
they can live without air?
- That's cruel.
- Come on.
It's neat.
Glen.
Glen.
It's just irresponsibility, I don't know.
Is it too late to call
Mrs. Vandegrift?
Oh, Daddy, please.
You can't call a babysitter.
I'm gonna be 16 in two weeks.
You said I was mature enough
to accept the responsibility.
And honestly, I promise,
there won't be any problems.
Well, what do you think, Glen?
- Can you be trusted?
- I don't know.
If your father and I agree...
...to let the two of you stay alone
for three whole days...
...how can we be sure you'll behave?
- It was Terry that started it.
If Terry jumped off a bridge,
I suppose you jump off too.
Sure, why not?
Look, I can take care of Terry
and I can take care of Glen.
And I can take care of this house.
Please?
All right.
But you, young man,
are grounded for the weekend.
And that means that you do not
leave this house until we come back.
Grounded? For real?
For real.
And after dinner, pal,
you fill in that hole.
Okay.
Good night, Glen.
No, leave it on.
Glen, what's with you today?
It's... I don't know.
- It's something about that hole.
- What do you mean?
I don't know. It's just weird.
Well, you filled it in, didn't you?
Yeah, but Terry told me something.
What?
Well, he said a long time ago,
when they were building our house...
...a workman got killed.
And the other workmen
didn't wanna tell the police...
...so they sealed him up
in one of our walls.
Look, son...
...let me tell you something
about Terry.
You remember last year,
when Terry's mom died?
Yeah.
Well, ever since then,
Terry's been a little strange.
I think he's kind of angry inside
that his mom is gone.
So you just remember that
when he gets destructive...
...or tries to scare you.
I think he's just a little confused,
that's all.
- You know what I'm saying?
- I think so.
You want me to turn the light on?
- No, it's okay.
- Good night, tiger.
- Dad?
- Yeah?
Never mind. Good night.
Good night, pal.
Don't forget that Angus
gets his pills every day.
Make sure they're hidden in his food,
or he'll spit them out.
- I don't want them on the furniture.
- I know, Mom.
- Goodbye, hon.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Mom.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Dad.
- See you, guys.
- Bye. Bye, Mom.
- Goodbye.
And don't forget, the numbers
where we'll be are on the refrigerator.
Al, if you need us for any reason,
don't be afraid to give us a call.
- It's just being responsible.
- I know, Mom.
- Remember, you stay in this weekend.
- Okay.
I want the house clean
when we come home. No parties.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Lori and Linda.
Hey, wow, great party.
I don't know. Here, there.
But you totaled his car.
Hey, how did they get that dog
up here?
Where?
Put me down.
Excuse me.
Hey, blow off, Angus. You stink.
I'd like to smell you when you're 97.
- He's not 97.
- In dog years.
It's just not gonna break.
Why don't we get the Lee sisters
to look at it?
Yeah.
No, we can throw it off
the roof tomorrow.
- Come on, let's go party.
- She won't let us.
Sure, she will. Why not?
She's just... Oh, forget it.
Told you. Look at it.
Is it supposed to do that?
I don't know.
Maybe it just got compressed air when
it was being formed or something.
Look, it made some kind of marks.
Those are words. What does it say?
It's weird.
She makes her way
down the dark hallway.
And the scream
keeps getting louder.
And there's also this noise,
like a laugh.
And there's
this weird tearing sound.
So she gets to the door
and then she opens it really slowly.
There, in the rocking chair...
...was the decomposed corpse
of her dead father.
And in his lap is the severed head
of her boyfriend.
And he's tearing out hair
by the handful.
- You made that up.
- I believe it.
- Come on, it's bullshit.
- Weird things happen all the time...
...so we make up ghost stories...
...to explain the powers inside us
that we don't understand.
- What kind of powers?
- Like what?
Well, like...
- Well, you guys ever do levitation?
- I've seen that. It's an illusion.
No, it's a matter of concentration.
It really works.
- Here, I'll show you.
- Do you believe in all that stuff?
Me too.
Now, everyone, just clear your mind.
You broke your concentration.
- No, I broke my finger.
- Too much junk food.
It doesn't matter. It's not the weight.
Hey, my man, come here.
- He's too small.
- Hey, Glen, go back to your room.
No, come here. It'll be all right.
- Let's see if we can levitate him.
- It's a cinch, he's a midget.
- Okay, we'll just use two people.
- Sit down.
Brad?
Okay, hold your arms out,
one on top of the other...
...and make little circles...
...to transmit
and stimulate the energy.
And everyone else, concentrate.
Now, everyone,
just clear your mind...
...and think of Glen
as light as a feather.
Concentrate.
Okay, like dust...
...drifting in front of the windows.
Like dandelions in the breeze.
Rise. Rise.
- Rise.
- Hey.
Help, come on. Put me down.
- Is he okay?
- It's just an illusion.
Glen.
Maybe I won't do that again.
Glen.
Glen, you all right?
I think it's because he cried
in front of everybody.
Hey, Glen, don't be embarrassed.
Crying's nothing.
Remember when Trevor Stubblefield
pantsed me...
...in front of the whole auditorium?
Yeah, and I barfed on Steve Slavitt
after the 12-minute run.
- I wanna call Mom and Dad.
- Glen, no.
- I want you to call them.
- What am I gonna tell them?
"We're scared because we
levitated Glen and he broke the light"?
- You must love Mrs. Vandegrift.
- Al...
Look, Terry can sleep over
and keep you company.
Let's all get some sleep.
I'm gonna lock up.
You really barfed on Steve Slavitt?
Yup.
Terry.
I love you.
Mom?
- I need you.
- Mommy?
I love you.
Terry, come to me.
Terry, I've missed you so.
No. Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Angus.
What's going on?
I'm really sorry.
- Yeah, he was really old.
- Yeah.
He was 97.
They don't live much beyond that.
Well, you wanna come over later
and mess around?
Sure, yeah.
Guess I'll see you later, huh?
See you later.
Dad.
Oh, great.
What did you do with Angus?
Hey, don't worry about it.
Aren't you gonna call Mom
and Dad?
No, I'll take care of it.
Well, if you're not going to, I am.
Glen, Mom and Dad
are gonna be home tomorrow.
I don't care.
I want them to know what happened.
You're not calling them.
- Nice try.
- Fine. I'll just call them later.
<i>What's the matter?
Isn't Romper Room on today?</i>
Buzz off, clown face.
Don't you have to go
change your Pampers?
Don't you have to go
and join the circus?
Hey, you guys, come on.
<i>In a time before the earth,
before the sun...</i>
<i>...and before the light of the stars,
when all was darkness and chaos...</i>
<i>...the old gods, the forgotten gods...</i>
<i>...ruled the darkness.</i>
<i>What was theirs now belongs
to the world of light and substance.</i>
<i>And the old gods, the rightful masters,
are jealous...</i>
<i>...watching mankind with a hatred
that is as boundless as the stars...</i>
<i>...with plans for the destruction
of man that are beyond imagining.</i>
<i>There's a passageway
between our physical world...</i>
<i>...of light and pleasure...</i>
<i>...and their spiritual world
of madness and pain.</i>
<i>A gate behind which
the demons wait...</i>
<i>...for the chance
to take back what is theirs.</i>
Eric really likes you.
You gotta come to the beach with us.
- Well...
- And everybody's going.
We're having a bonfire
and everything.
I don't know. I mean, I just can't go.
Look, just leave him some Gerbers.
He'll be fine.
Al, you can't go out.
What about Angus?
What about
what happened last night?
You have to call Mom and Dad.
- Glen, cool out.
- What's he talking about?
Tell them.
Angus died last night.
- Tell them about the other stuff.
- There is no other stuff.
What's the matter with you guys?
Something really scary
happened last night.
- What?
- The levitation.
You guys were there.
Hey, little man,
that was just an illusion.
What do you know, lover boy?
- What is your problem?
- You, Alexandra.
- You're acting like a baby.
- Just shut up.
- Fag.
- Hey.
<i>Très uncool.</i>
Well, what are we waiting for?
- Look...
- You can't back down now.
You have to go.
I have to do something about Angus.
Take him to the animal shelter.
- Eric will do it.
- Yeah, yeah, I'll do it.
We'll all go to the mall, get munchies
and stuff, and we'll all meet up there.
Come on.
Don't be too long, Eric.
Yeah, okay.
- See you.
- See you at the mall.
Come on, Alexandra, he'll be okay.
Oh, no.
We're in big trouble.
Tell me about it.
How could it come back by itself?
I think I know what this means.
You know, with the levitation
and all that other weird stuff.
What?
You got demons.
- Demons?
- Come on.
Better try to cover it up first.
I'll take this side.
I don't think
this is gonna be enough.
Give me a break.
Slow down.
How do you know so much
about this stuff?
I've got something to show you.
Shit, closed.
Sorry, dude, no vacancies.
They're called Sacrifyx.
Dad brought it from Europe.
And it's got all this stuff in it.
See, these guys are, like,
really serious about demonology.
And it's like they're trying
to warn you.
See? These guys knew.
They wrote their own music.
<i>They got their lyrics from this thing
called The Dark Book.</i>
That's like the Bible for demons.
And here's the creepy part.
This is their only album.
And after they made it,
they all died in a plane crash.
And look at this, the demon lord.
- Terry, come on.
- Wait a minute.
See, the lyrics in the album
tell you how to summon the demons.
Now, there's this certain time
when constellations are aligned...
...when you can open the gate
and let the old gods...
Those are the demons.
- come through.
Well, I checked, and it's, like, now.
- Terry, but...
- What?
Terry, this is a record album.
There are these songs
that tell you about the whole ritual...
...for opening the gate.
We did it.
Here.
Start by reading this aloud.
You know what it means?
"Gods of darkness,
breeders of chaos...
...come forth and take possession
of this vile world."
And you need blood.
Remember when you cut yourself?
It's all in here.
The hole.
Okay? The geode.
And look at this.
Levitation.
What's that suppose to prove?
It proves we're in big trouble.
I didn't tell you about
the most important part of the ritual.
The sacrifice.
We didn't kill anybody.
It doesn't have to be a person.
It could be an animal.
Well, then how come
we haven't seen any demons?
I think it's because the sacrifice
wasn't complete.
If we had put the offering in the hole,
we would have blown the gate open.
I think right now, it's, like,
only opened a crack.
They can influence us,
but they can't get through.
It's just...
How can this be true?
Wait, you haven't heard
anything yet.
<i>- Be gone.
- What's this?</i>
<i>- Be gone, be gone.
- The album, backwards.</i>
Tells you how to close the gate.
"We consecrate this ground,
this world of light.
We curse the abominations
of darkness.
We block the passage of evil.
May the old devils depart.
May they burn in the fires
of their own damnation.
May they freeze
in the infinite cold and darkness...
...of their own hideous creation."
Isn't that kind of insulting?
I guess it's supposed to be.
I mean,
we're trying to get rid of them.
Maybe you should do it
one more time.
All right.
Be gone, be gone, be gone.
Thou art hideous,
filth-eating, unspeakable...
What the hell are you doing?
What's under the door?
Hey, did you guys dig
in that hole again?
We accidentally summoned demons,
who used to rule the universe...
...to come and take over the world.
Yeah, we found out about it
from one of Terry's albums.
Well, they're gone now.
So, what's under the door?
See? They're gone.
It worked.
You guys are weird.
I thought you were going
to the beach today.
I was, but I spent all my money.
On what?
What, are you gonna just stand there,
or do you wanna launch it?
- Come on.
- All right.
Listen to this.
"Beware, conjurer.
Once set free into our world...
...the power of the old gods
is unimaginable...
...as they seek two human sacrifices
to establish their hell on earth.
The ruination of mankind
lurks just beyond the gate.
The demons can only be destroyed
and the gate closed once again...
...by a true spirit of gentle passions,
wielding energy...
...derived from pure love and light."
Okay, Houston, ready for liftoff.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Ready.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Blast off.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
Who's that?
Well, there's one way to find out.
Demons aren't gonna ring
the doorbell.
Worse. Lee sisters.
You are just really lucky
to have us around.
We got you a great new top.
- And I got these new jeans, but I...
- Hey.
I thought you were going
to the beach tonight.
- We're having a slumber party.
- You're not invited. Don't get retarded.
Alexandra, what's your problem?
Eric always...
And we have a surprise for you.
We're gonna streak your hair.
Hey, don't touch that.
I'm just looking at it.
Come on, that's my dad's.
Put that down.
He never lets us play with it.
Okay, okay, don't have a cow.
Way to go.
Here.
Thunderbolt.
She didn't throw it out.
Are you guys in bed yet?
Almost. Put it back.
What are you doing?
Probably fagging off.
- What'd you do to your face?
- None of your beeswax, four-eyes.
I think it's a definite improvement.
Hey, eat your feet, dwarf.
Suck my nose till my head caves in.
- Why don't you grow up?
- Drop dead.
- Up yours.
- Piss off.
Why don't you just shut up?
Just go to bed.
Did you ever want a brother or sister
or anything?
Nope.
Man.
Oh, boy.
"Dark master.
Demon of unimaginable size
and power."
Terry?
Terry.
Terry.
Are you awake?
Al!
Al, they're back!
- The monsters came back!
- What? What is it?
They broke the window.
They're in my room.
What are you talking about?
Oh, my gosh.
Terry?
Hey, Terry, wake up.
Terry?
Terry.
What did you do to your hair?
Real cute.
- Al!
- Glen, get over here!
- Help her.
- Help!
Al, Al!
- Pull!
- Get it off of me!
Pull. Pull.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- Go!
- Let's go.
- Run, run, run!
- Hurry, come on!
- Come on!
- Down there, go.
- Where are we going?
- Run.
Somebody tell me what's going on.
Mom. Dad.
You've been bad.
Glen, come on.
What are we gonna do?
Back door.
What are we gonna do?
Oh, shoot.
Hurry up, Al. Hurry up, Al.
Would you guys shut up?
I don't see anything.
- Come on.
- I'm trying.
Let me take a look first.
Good idea.
Al, I think you better come back.
Shut up, you guys.
Al, come back.
What do you want?
What is it?
Come on.
- Hurry up, Al, come on!
- Come on, hurry up!
Hurry!
Look.
Oh, gross.
You okay?
What the hell is going on?
- Can somebody knock her out again?
- I'm calling the police.
Answer it!
Hello?
<i>You've been bad.</i>
We have to close the gate.
We have to go to the hole
and do it right.
You guys were serious
about that demon stuff?
What does it look like?
What the hell are you talking about?
The spells, they're in the basement.
Who's gonna go get them?
Are you sure
we can get rid of them?
Yeah, I've got all the spells
and cures to banish the demons.
Demons? What kind?
Don't ask.
How do you know what to do?
Just trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Great.
- Al.
- What is it?
Forget it.
Over there.
What? Do they hate music?
Great. Now what do we do?
- The Bible.
- What?
Prayers. The Bible.
That's what they always use.
These guys are older
than the Bible.
Do you have anything better?
How do we know what to read?
We'll find something.
Yeah, we went to Sunday school.
We should have called Mom
and Dad before this.
- I wish Mrs. Vandegrift was here.
- It's a little too late for that.
- We found one.
- Good.
Okay, let's do it.
The gate's open.
I know it is.
No, it isn't.
How do you know, Terry?
Because we'd all be dead meat
by now.
We'd be the sacrifices.
Sacrifices?
I told you, the demons
need two human sacrifices to stay...
...and make their hell on earth.
We don't all have to go.
Yeah, maybe it would be better
if we waited inside.
My heroes.
You've got to be kidding.
I hope this works.
Me too.
"Deliver me from my enemies,
Father in heaven.
Deliver me
from the works of the devil. Quickly.
And save me
from the devils of blood.
Thou shall bury the evil thing,
brought to the earth no more.
God is the light.
Pray God will pray for thee.
For God is my high tower."
It's working. Hey, that's pretty good.
Hey, it works.
I can still hear them.
There's one more part here,
then they should be gone.
Don't get so close.
It's okay, it's working.
- Get back.
- Nobody...
- Terry!
- Terry!
- Terry!
- What are we gonna do?
Terry!
- Terry!
- Terry!
- Terry!
- Terry!
Where is he?
Hi.
Terry, answer me!
Terry, answer me!
Help me!
It's not gonna work!
Let go.
Help!
Help!
Get me out of here!
Help!
Here he comes.
Get over here.
Terry, grab it!
"Deliver me from my enemy."
- Stop it!
- "Deliver me from infamy."
- Glen, stop!
- "Save me from the devils of blood."
Glen, stop it!
You're making them mad!
Grab my feet. Hurry.
- Pull me.
- Get us out of here!
Got it!
- Come on.
- Pull me up!
Al, pull.
Hurry.
Hurry up.
I lost my shoe.
Where's the Bible?
Where's the Bible?
- I don't know what to read.
- Read anything.
"In the beginning, God created
the heavens and the earth."
- It's gone.
- It's gone?
- It's gone!
- All right!
- It's gone!
- All right!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
All right, all right!
Come on, let's go!
Yeah!
- All right.
- We did it.
Yeah.
Hello?
Wait.
- It's just us.
- What happened?
It worked.
I knew it.
Are you sure?
No, we're all dead.
Welcome to heaven.
What were you guys doing
in there?
We heard noises.
- No.
- What?
Al, what is it?
What have you been doing?
Mudwrestling?
It's not funny.
What are you doing here?
- Came to party.
- Yeah.
Thought we'd surprise you.
Well, look, I've had enough surprises
for one night.
- Could you guys just please leave?
- Come on, Al, be real.
Al, we invited them.
- Maybe you should just go with them.
- Fine.
- Come on, let's go.
- We can take a hint.
- What a drag.
- Let's go.
She's just not ready
for me yet, guys.
- Shut up.
- Shut up.
Boy. Mom and Dad are gonna
be pissed when they see this.
Yeah. What should we tell them?
- Frisbee.
- Frisbee.
It's gonna be dawn soon. Why don't
we all clean up and get some sleep?
Are you kidding?
I'm not gonna sleep for a week.
Yeah, come on.
- Let's go watch some TV.
- Yeah, okay.
I'm gonna get cleaned up.
- Al?
- Yeah?
You're better
than Mrs. Vandegrift any day.
You know, I think it wouldn't be so bad
to have a sister.
<i>No, stop. No.</i>
I wonder if we can still sell it.
I don't know.
- Here, catch.
- Glen.
Way to go.
Terry!
It's the Workman.
I just made it up.
No, no, no.
Let go of me.
Terry!
Let go!
Help!
No!
Help. Help.
Help!
- Let go.
- Glen.
- Let go! Let go!
- Glen!
Glen!
What the hell was that?
The Workman. It got Terry.
- The what?
- He just made it up, and it got him.
He took him into the wall.
What do you mean?
It's their first human sacrifice.
Dad's gun.
It's all my fault.
Dad's gun.
- Glen.
- It's all my fault.
Go get Dad's gun.
It's all my fault.
Glen.
Glen, go!
Hurry!
- It's me, Glen.
- Help!
Glen?
Hurry!
Come on.
Help!
Help! Al, help!
Get him off of me. Get him off.
Al, come on!
Close the door.
Hurry!
Hurry!
- Where's the gun?
- Over there.
Did Terry say that there was some way
we can kill them?
Energy derived from...
I can't remember.
Shit.
Let go! Let me go!
Glen, please, help me!
Glen!
The second sacrifice.
Love and light.
That's it. The Thunderbolt.
Energy derived from...
Come on. Where is it?
Come on.
Please.
Hell on earth.
No!
Come back here!
Take me instead!
Come back!
What do you want?
Another sacrifice?
Come back! Take me instead.
Come back.
Come back.
Glen.
Help us.
Glen.
Help us.
Come on.
Happy birthday, Al!
Yeah!
Angus.
Angus.
Good boy.
Al.
Glen.
Glen.
Glen.
- Angus.
- Terry.
All right.
Think they'll notice?
Give me a break.
You're my best buddies.
