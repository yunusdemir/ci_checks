<b>go and talk to Danny T's lawyer.</b>
<b>Like hell I am.</b>
<b>You use them.
Coming back all humble.</b>
<b>You're not asking for money.</b>
<b>You're giving Danny this
guy as a gift, as a favor.</b>
<b>Gator, that guy is a fucking pig.</b>
<b>Shh! Just trust me.</b>
<b>You're gonna get the
negotiation of your life.</b>
<b>Ready for the big day tomorrow?</b>
<b>It's just a birthday.</b>
<b>Hey, come on, it's the 10th birthday.
It's a special one.</b>
<b>I guess.</b>
<b>Hey, look what I
found jumping around.</b>
<b>Jumping around?
Yeah, jumping around.</b>
<b>Thanks.</b>
<b>It's nice.</b>
<b>I know it's not as
good as the original,</b>
<b>but I thought she might fill
in until we find Bunny.</b>
<b>Yep.</b>
<b>You know, I was thinking,</b>
<b>you should have a birthday
party with your class.</b>
<b>Can Miss Hetch come?</b>
<b>She's the one who planned it.</b>
<b>My idea, of course.</b>
<b>Thanks, Dad.</b>
<b>Yep.</b>
<b>Sheryl.
Sheryl Mott.</b>
<b>Surprise, surprise,
surprise.</b>
<b>You're not a hard man to find,
Werksey, old habits and all.</b>
<b>How are you doing, Sheryl?</b>
<b>What's up, kid?</b>
<b>I want you to look at something.</b>
<b>Like what?</b>
<b>You got a new gang tattoo
that you want to show me?</b>
<b>It's a little bit
more important than that.</b>
<b>It's a gift for Danny T.</b>
<b>(LOCK BUZZING)</b>
<b>GUARD: You got 10 minutes.</b>
<b>"A gift," she says.</b>
<b>This guy killed my fucking kid.</b>
<b>Please tell me you know
where this motherfucker is.</b>
<b>Guess what? Time to go.</b>
<b>She does.</b>
<b>Hey, you can finish it tonight.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Take care of this for me.</b>
<b>Miss Klum?</b>
<b>What are you going to do now, Broker?
What do you want to say?</b>
<b>Wanna come to my
party this weekend?</b>
<b>What, Teddy? She's talking to
you, hon, not me. Come on.</b>
<b>I guess. Yeah.</b>
<b>Cool. Come on, let's go.</b>
<b>All right. Go on.</b>
<b>Teddy got some blood on his shirt.
Are you replacing it?</b>
<b>Yeah, I'm replacing it.</b>
<b>All right.
I guess that does it.</b>
<b>See you around, Miss Klum.</b>
<b>TEEDO:
So, I heard something interesting.</b>
<b>Yeah? Something tells me you're
gonna tell me what that is.</b>
<b>Just that Jimmy Klum got his ass whopped.
So did his kid.</b>
<b>Fascinating.</b>
<b>Where did you hear that?</b>
<b>Well, you shoot enough pool,
drink enough beer in town,</b>
<b>you hear a little bit
of everything, Broker.</b>
<b>By the way, that's old news.
We shook and made up.</b>
<b>Is that what you think?</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>I got some new news for you.</b>
<b>People around here
don't shake and make up.</b>
<b>It never goes away that easy.</b>
<b>It's old-school in the
feuding sense around here.</b>
<b>Hey, someone broke into our house.
Is that old-school?</b>
<b>There it is, that's
called country payback.</b>
<b>Somebody's just trying to scare
your ass out of here, is all.</b>
<b>You'll be all right.</b>
<b>Jimmy Klum, you mean?</b>
<b>Fuck, no.
Jimmy Klum is a bitch.</b>
<b>Listen, I know
everybody around here,</b>
<b>and Jimmy Klum's bitch ass
ain't breaking into shit.</b>
<b>Now, his wife's brother
is a whole different story.</b>
<b>Who's his wife's brother?</b>
<b>They call him Gator
for some dumb-ass reason.</b>
<b>Lives down by
the Rayville watershed.</b>
<b>Fronts as a boat mechanic,
can't fix shit.</b>
<b>But the word is he's
cooking up that meth.</b>
<b>Hey, if I was you, I'd be real
careful around him, Broker.</b>
<b>He ain't true, you hear me?</b>
<b>The sheriff know about him?
(LAUGHS)</b>
<b>Know about him?</b>
<b>Man, him and Sheriff Keith
got it all figured out.</b>
<b>You see, Gator snitches for Keith,</b>
<b>throws him all the small
fish, makes his job easy.</b>
<b>In turn, Sheriff looks the other
direction whenever Gator wants to cook.</b>
<b>Some bullshit.</b>
<b>Yeah, thanks for
the history lesson.</b>
<b>Listen, I grew up
around these rednecks,</b>
<b>and I think you ought to know
who you're fucking with.</b>
<b>And in case you got any interest,</b>
<b>Gator eats breakfast nearly every
day at Lions café, just like me.</b>
<b>Now, he don't look
like much or nothing,</b>
<b>but you remember what I told you,</b>
<b>he ain't true.</b>
<b>Crazy, waiting to happen.</b>
<b>Hey, where are you?</b>
<b>They set the meet at this fucking
crayfish shack off Creek Road.</b>
<b>You know I'm allergic
to this shit, right?</b>
<b>Just get it done,
all right, Sheryl?</b>
<b>The guy they're sending,
Cyrus Hanks.</b>
<b><i>Are you fucking kidding me? I know him.
He's a fucking animal, Gator.</i></b>
<b>He's a fucking stone-cold killer.</b>
<b>Look, don't worry about any of that.
Just make it happen.</b>
<b>(CHILDREN CHATTERING)</b>
<b>(ALL SINGING)</b>
<b>(ALL CHEERING)</b>
<b>Look at you.</b>
<b>Nice place, Cyrus.</b>
<b>Yeah, well, let's just say I'm
comfortable around fat people.</b>
<b>They eat the way

<b>they're fucking oblivious
to everything around them.</b>
<b>Plus, I love these fucking things.</b>
<b>Are you hungry?</b>
<b>No, I'm fine.</b>
<b>Sweetheart, black coffee
with a little honey.</b>
<b>So, what's it going to take</b>
<b>to find this rat fuck?
You know where he is, yeah?</b>
<b>Him and his kid.</b>
<b>And to get him,
you want what, exactly?</b>
<b>I don't want anything for the narc.</b>
<b>He's a gift.
Oh, he's a gift? He's a gift.</b>
<b>Since when does a meth
whore give away gifts?</b>
<b>I've spent the last couple of years</b>
<b>putting together
the right equipment,</b>
<b>perfect partner, perfect location.</b>
<b>All we need is distribution, that's
the main thing we're after...</b>
<b>(LAUGHING)</b>
<b>You got me fucking fooled, Sheryl.</b>
<b>'Cause underneath this

<b>you're a fucking genius.</b>
<b>Where's the narc?</b>
<b>Do we have a deal?</b>
<b>Where is the narc?</b>
<b>Do we have a deal, Cyrus?</b>
<b>Come over here.</b>
<b>You got five seconds before I drill

<b>and then into the floor,

<b>Don't you fuck with me, Sheryl.</b>
<b>All right.</b>
<b>Where is the fucking narc?</b>
<b>(BOTH LAUGHING)
Bye!</b>
<b>Bye.</b>
<b>Hi.</b>
<b>What are you doing?</b>
<b>Cleaning.</b>
<b>Cleaning?
Yeah.</b>
<b>It's filthy in there.</b>
<b>Well, I'm glad you noticed.</b>
<b>What are you doing here?</b>
<b>I came to tell you that I dealt
with Broker, the girl's father.</b>
<b>I want you to stay away from him.</b>
<b>Hey, you got something for me?</b>
<b>Cassie, I'm trying
to tell you something.</b>
<b>Do not go near Broker anymore.</b>
<b>Got it.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Well, I'm not holding, so I'm
sorry, I can't help you.</b>
<b>You're not holding?</b>
<b>Uh-huh.</b>
<b>Well, I think
that's fucking bullshit.</b>
<b>Cassie, why don't you
just clean yourself up?</b>
<b>That's fucking bullshit!</b>
<b>Take a fucking shower.
Then what the fuck are you doing here?</b>
<b>Eat a sandwich or something.</b>
<b>You take a fucking shower,
Gator, look at you!</b>
<b>Cassie, just pull
yourself together.</b>
<b>I'm sick of this shit.
Hey, hey, hey.</b>
<b>Shh! Teddy is sleeping.</b>
<b>You wake him up, it's gonna be...</b>
<b>Don't worry.</b>
<b>I'm not gonna make
any noise, I'm leaving.</b>
<b>No more. I'm done.</b>
<b>No more, Cassie.</b>
<b>Yo, Gator.</b>
<b>How is it hanging, man?</b>
<b>Why?</b>
<b>Listen, man, I need a favor.</b>
<b>A favor?</b>
<b>Look, Jimmy, you know that I already
keep your garbage business going.</b>
<b>Man, I need you to stop

<b>All right? Look at her, man.

<b>Maybe you should do a

<b>(PHONE VIBRATES)</b>
<b>Yeah.

<b>Like a baby.</b>
<b>What have you got?</b>
<b><i>Gator Bodine. I sniffed around

<b>No convictions.

<b>No, don't bother.</b>
<b><i>But there is something,

<b>Sheryl Marie Mott, ex-biker

<b><i>Busted twice for smuggling

<b>One of those times was to

<b>(CHUCKLES)</b>
<b>Ugh.</b>
<b>Oh, shit.</b>
<b>Fuck!</b>
<b>This should be interesting.</b>
<b>We've never been properly

<b>Is that what this is,

<b>Yeah, that's right.</b>
<b>Well, I won't ask your name.</b>
<b>I personally believe your reputation

<b>To some people.
Yeah.</b>
<b>Maybe it should be for you, too.</b>
<b>You've worked up a pretty
bad rep around here,</b>
<b>beating up that poor kids

<b>It pissed off some of the locals.</b>
<b>And his daughter beat up Jimmy's kid.
Can you believe that?</b>
<b>Now, what kind of parent would teach
a kid to do something like that?</b>
<b>Look, I don't want
any more problems.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Anything else you're
thinking hard about?</b>
<b>'Cause I can smell

<b>If someone has an issue

<b>I don't want my kid involved.</b>
<b>Involved?</b>
<b>(INHALES)</b>

<b>Okay.</b>
<b>(PHONE RINGING)</b>
<b>Well, I think you're reaching.</b>

<b>Hey, you did all right,

<b>Gator'd be pissed if we did

<b>Who's watching your kid?</b>
