Halt!
Easy, Schultz,
it's only me, Carter.
Oh. You scared me.
Light.
Hold this.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
My rifle.
Sorry, Schultz.
I don't keep it loaded.
Thanks for the light,
Schultz.
Hello, Mama Bear.
Hello, Mama Bear.
This is Goldilocks.
Mama Bear to Goldilocks,
stand by for transmission.
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the King's horses
and all the King's men
could not put Humpty Dumpty back
together again,
even though they tried
for two days. Over and out.
What's it mean?
Yeah, what is it?
He'll finish.
Hold it, hold it one minute,
one minute, one minute.
What?
All right. "Probing raid,
repeat probing raid.
"Not an invasion.
"Sector Q-19, 48 hours.
"Birthday present for Adolf.
"Need latest information troop
movements your area.
"Last transmission 1500 hours
tomorrow.
"Following that, radio silence.
Cease all escape activity.
Surprise essential."
What a birthday
present, huh?
We're really going
to give it to 'em, huh?
See how the
Krauts like it.
Hold it, hold it!
This is a reconnaissance job.
I need a volunteer
who's got plenty of guts
and can move fast.
Oh, you can depend
on us, Colonel.
Oh, yeah, we'll figure
somebody to send.
Sure, one of us
will be glad to go.
Now, who's going to step forward
and take this job?
Thank you, LeBeau.
I didn't move a muscle.
You've got that
volunteer look.
That's how I got married.
"Volunteer" the same way.
( <i>crickets chirping</i> )
Goldilocks calling Mama Bear.
Goldilocks calling Mama Bear.
Come in, Mama Bear, come in.
It's no use, Colonel.
They've shut down.
They warned us: radio silence
till after the raid.
Missed them
by less than two hours.
Gee, I couldn't
help from being
late, Colonel.
A patrol
stopped me.
The area was
crawling
with Krauts.
I had to make
a big detour
to get back.
You could have moved
a little faster.
Oh, yeah?
I'm dressed like
an old woman.
And why would
a little old woman
be running through
the woods?
You tell me that.
You could always say
you were being chased
by a little old man.
All right.
All right,
all right.
Knock it off.
We got a problem.
Headquarters doesn't know
they've moved in
a gun emplacement
and we don't have any
communications.
The map.
Shmeckhausen
is the reference
point, Colonel.
All right, Schmeckburg,
Schmeckhof, Shmeckstadt.
Here it is,
Shmeckhausen.
That battery commands
a whole section of the beach.
Exactly. They'll
smash the raid
before it
gets started.
Sitting ducks.
How many guns?
I counted twelve; all 88s.
Oh, murder.
If only we could
knock 'em out.
Hey, maybe hand grenades
would do a little damage.
It's 15 miles from
here at least.
I'll warm up
my pitching arm.
Well, let's face it.
Adolf's going to have a nice
present for his birthday:
Allied landing knocked out
before it starts.
If only we could...
LeBeau.
Did I volunteer
for something again?
You're beautiful!
I am?
You said the magic word,
"Adolf's birthday."
What are the
forgery boys
working on?
Fake raffle tickets.
We've been selling them
to the Krauts.
Raffle tickets?
Yeah. It's an all-expense-
paid trip to New Orleans
for the Mardi Gras.
It's for after the war.
All right, look,
tell them I need
a set of orders
for the commander
of that gun battery.
You got it.
Newkirk, I need
a motorcycle
and a sidecar
from the car pool.
You got it.
I need some
German uniforms.
Uh, make 'em infantry,
enlisted men for a change.
You got it.
All right,
let me see:
we got uniforms, orders,
transportation.
Did I forget anything?
Yeah, how about assigning
a couple of guys
to help me off
with my girdle?
You got 'em.
"In keeping with orders
from the Commanding General,
"Fourth Army Group,
"military units will show
respect and affection
"for our beloved Fuhrer
with proper celebration
"to be enjoyed by all ranks.
"Details for your relief
for this purpose
"are to be worked out
with the bearer,
"Captain Hoganburg.
Signed, Colonel commanding..."
I can hardly make out
this signature.
The Colonel's
a very busy man,
administrative
details and...
Hoopleman!
Who gave you permission
to be at ease?
Stand at attention!
<i>Achtung!</i>
<i>Jawohl, Herr Kapitan!</i>
You have to keep after them
every minute.
As you were saying, Major.
According to these orders,
you are to relieve me for the
Fuhrer's birthday celebration.
Yes, sir.
I have a small detachment
on temporary patrol
in Shmeckhausen.
At your service, sir.
Ah! Does Headquarters expect
a squad of infantry
to relieve
experienced artillery men?
Major, may I suggest you confirm
the orders with headquarters?
<i>Ja,</i> an excellent idea.
I will do just that.
Hello, this is
Wilhelmstrasse <i>Zwei</i> calling
Bismarck <i>Vierzehn.</i>
Hello, this is
Bismarck <i>Vierzehn.</i>
This is Major Keitel.
I wish to speak
with Colonel Stimmer.
<i>Jawohl, Herr Major.</i>
Colonel, it's Major Keitel
of Wilhelmstrasse <i>Zwei.</i>
Colonel Stimmer speaking.
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>
Hoopleman!
Colonel, I have your orders,
and I wish to confirm
the Fuhrer's birthday.
Ah, you wish to confirm
our beloved leader's birthday.
That is very kind of you, Major.
I only hope for your sake
the Gestapo is not listening.
Sir, you misunderstood...
You will carry out your orders
to the letter.
That is an order. Understood?
And Major,
it has been reported to me
that the buildings on your post
need attention.
Well, sir, we could use
a little fixing up and...
See that it is done before the
beloved Fuhrer's birthday party.
There may be press here
from Berlin.
And Major...
that is an order, understood?
Understood, sir!
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>
Hoopleman!
Let me talk
to Captain Hoganburg.
Yes, sir. <i>Heil Hitler.</i>
The Colonel wants you, Captain.
Hello?
Captain Hoganburg speaking.
Oh, yes, sir.
Fine, thank you, sir.
A case of Rhine wine
and a case of schnapps.
Quarts, not the fifths.
I understand, sir.
To your headquarters.
Consider it done, sir.
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>
May I tell you something
in confidence, sir?
Of course.
There is a
drinking problem.
Pressure of the war.
Really?
That would account
for the strange way
he sounded.
Has Berlin been told?
Bah! You know their answer.
"What kind of schnapps
does he like?
We'll send him a case."
Extraordinary.
Yes. And a tough man.
They know it.
<i>Ja,</i> so do I.
He's ordered me
to clean up my post
in time for the Fuhrer's
birthday celebration.
Impossible!
I have no men to spare
for this kind of work.
Major, you have heard
of Luft Stalag 13?
A prisoner of war camp
a few miles from here, isn't it?
Crowded with able-bodied
prisoners of war.
Might I suggest
that you borrow
a few to do the work?
Excellent suggestion,
Captain.
( <i>chuckles</i> )
Enemies of the Third Reich help
with preparations
for the Fuhrer's birthday.
Nice touch, eh?
Be good to put the
<i>schwein</i> to work.
Tell me, Captain, do you happen
to know the Commandant's name
at Stalag 13?
I'll call him.
Klink, Colonel Wilhelm Klink.
Full Colonel?
Yes, but a typical
desk officer.
He's never been in combat.
I think he would faint
at the sight of a rare steak.
( <i>both laugh</i> )
Hoopleman!
Who gave you permission
to laugh?
Wipe that smile
off your face!
<i>Achtung!</i>
( <i>clears throat</i> )
If you have no further
need for me, sir...
Captain Hoganburg,
a great pleasure.
You have been
very helpful.
<i>Danke,</i> sir. I've tried.
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>
Hoopleman! Right face!
<i>Achtung!</i> Forward march!
My wife's brother.
Mmm...
This is the only way to fight
the war. You know that.
Yeah, but I wish
that we would be
on the same side.
I'll come over.
I only see you
a few minutes
at a time.
Helga, how would you like
to go to a party tomorrow night?
<i>Wunderbar!</i>
Oh, I love parties.
But what
is the occasion?
Hitler's birthday.
Oh.
Well, maybe we'll have
a good time anyway.
I was thinking...
Perhaps if you invited
some of your girlfriends--
blondes, brunettes, redheads,
a nice assortment, you know--
I'd arrange
to have you all picked up
and taken over
to Shmeckhausen.
Shmeckhausen?
But there's nothing
in Shmeckhausen.
We're arranging something
right now.
And how will you get
out of camp?
Don't go away.
Major Keitel, it is impossible.
I cannot let any of my prisoners
out of camp for such a purpose.
It's being arranged right now.
No one has ever
escaped Stalag 13
because I just simply
do not take such risks.
No, I don't care
what the occasion is...
Whose birthday?
Well, why didn't you say so?
Of course I can
arrange it, Major Keitel.
Good-bye... What?
Oh, yes. <i>Heil Hitler.</i>
Every time I turn around, you
are having another birthday.
( <i>groans</i> )
Call Colonel Hogan!
You called?
Hogan!
Hogan, come in.
Colonel Hogan, you
wanted to see me?
Yes, sir. I'd like
to make a request.
Request denied.
What is it?
I like a man
with an open mind.
Sir, tomorrow's
Hitler's birthday.
Yes.
And I wondered if you'd
care to celebrate
by giving us two extra hours of
electric light in the barracks.
Mm-hmm.
So you can have
more time
for digging your
escape tunnel?
We've already
finished the tunnel.
We're working
on an elevator now.
You're being
impertinent.
Yes, sir. I do
the best I can.
Colonel Hogan.
From time to time,
prisoners of war
are asked to work,
for which they are paid.
Well, according
to the Geneva
Prisoner-of-War
Convention,
we can refuse.
Now, I need
one hour's work
at a military
installation outside of camp.
Request denied.
It's not heavy labor.
Is there any other kind?
Very well.
Assign a work party
and I'll give you...
40 minutes of additional
electric light in the barracks.
An hour and a half.
50 minutes?
An hour and a quarter.
One hour,
not a second more.
Throw in two
extra ball games
and you got
yourself a deal.
One extra ball game.
Forget it. I'll take my
business elsewhere.
All right, all
right, all right.
One hour of extra
electric light
and two extra ball games.
You got yourself a deal.
I'll assign
a work party.
Just one moment,
Colonel Hogan.
You know that eventually
I'm going to find that
escape tunnel of yours.
Oh, I hope so,
because it leads
direct to the
Russian front
and we need somebody
to lead the way.
Dismissed.
Don't forget the
girls for the party.
I won't.
( <i>Klink yelling</i> )
Sounds like a direct hit.
Where do I put it?
Over there.
Hey, Carter.
It's time to move.
Pass the word.
Gotcha. I'm on my way.
Uh, Schultz!
Hey, Schultz!
We, we've finished.
Nice. Very nice.
Very, very nice.
Now, let us go home!
Huh! "Home," he says.
Out, out, out, out!
Everybody, <i>raus!</i>
<i>Raus, schnell,</i>
<i>schnell, schnell,</i>
<i>schnell, schnell, schnell.</i>
Everybody <i>raus!</i>
Roll call!
Everybody out!
<i>Raus! Raus!</i>
<i>Schnell, schnell, schnell,</i>
<i>schnell, schnell,</i> everybody in.
Halt, halt, halt, halt, halt!
<i>Eine</i> moment. One moment. Halt!
<i>Eins!</i>
<i>Zwei!</i>
<i>Drei!</i>
<i>Vier! Funf!</i>
<i>Sechs! Sieben!</i>
<i>Acht!</i>
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Haven't I seen
you before?
I don't know.
Ever been
to Milwaukee?
Right here.
Hey, pal, have you
ever seen me before?
Never.
There, you see?
And he's been to Milwaukee.
Sure, and I've also
been to Dusseldorf and...
Say, didn't I meet you
in Dusseldorf?
Dusseldorf?
Bah! Go in!
<i>Zwanzig.</i>
<i>Danke.</i>
<i>Einundzwanzig,</i>
<i>zweiundzwanzig</i>
<i>drieundzwanzig,</i>
<i>vierundzwanzig</i>
<i>funfundzwanzig,</i>
<i>sechsundzwanzig...</i>
We're almost
ready, Colonel.
All right, all right.
Make it quick.
The girls
are on the way.
We're right on schedule.
Hey, look at me.
I'm a Kraut corporal.
I wish you were.
The war might
be over by now.
Get ready to move out,
and no talking.
Okay if we whistle
at the dames?
Only in German.
( <i>dance music playing</i> )
Major, you don't
seem to understand.
My orders are
to relieve you.
<i>Ja,</i> I know. You may
post your men at the guns,
but I will remain
in command personally.
But don't you
want to enjoy
the Fuhrer's birthday
party, sir?
Captain, I have thought it over,
and I feel it is my duty
as an officer to remain
in active command
of the guns at all times,
regardless
of the circumstances.
I understand, sir.
Excuse me.
Hoopleman!
How many times
must I tell you
to stand at attention?
<i>Achtung!</i>
Forgive me, Major.
Ever since I made him corporal,
I can't do a thing with him.
Now, you were saying?
I was saying, post your men,
but I will remain in command.
Sir, your orders
are to have a good time!
<i>Ja, ja, ja.</i> I know, I know,
but I am sure that if he
were here, the Fuhrer himself...
would approve of my actions
as being absolutely correct
and in line with...
with...
Call me if you need me, Captain.
All right, let's
wrap it up fast here.
LeBeau, you
stand guard here.
Nobody in or out.
Carter, back
up the truck
and keep the
motor running.
The rest of you
guys come with me.
Hey, Colonel,
what do we do
if the girls
come back?
Leave 'em alone,
and that's an order.
Oh, it sure is.
I can't get a break
in either army.
Colonel, this is
the wine for Klink.
It's not our best
stuff, is it?
For him?
Are you kidding?
It's practically vinegar.
Looks real.
Believe me,
you'd be better off
drinking the label.
Wait a minute.
I have to
drink <i>with</i> him.
Well, Colonel,
this is war.
You can't expect
to live forever.
Thanks a lot. Pour.
Very kind of you to help us
celebrate, Colonel Hogan.
Why not? We don't want
to be enemies
just because we're enemies.
Good health
and a short war.
Schultz, this
is a good wine.
<i>Jawohl, Herr Kommandant.</i>
It's a gay,
saucy little wine
we call "Hussy
of the Vineyards."
So?
Hogan, tell me...
how do prisoners-of-war
get wine?
Come on, Colonel.
Does Macy tell Gimbel?
Macy? Gimbel?
Schultz, do you
know these men?
No, Herr Kommandant!
I want you to check
the roll call
very carefully tomorrow.
<i>Jawohl, Herr Kommandant.</i>
Sorry I mentioned it.
So.
The traveling salesman
says to the farmer,
"My car broke down, and I'll
have to stay for the night."
The farmer says,
"I have to tell you something.
I don't have a daughter."
Let's go back
to Macy and Gimbel.
( <i>siren blaring</i> )
The invasion alarm.
<i>Achtung!</i>
To the guns!
<i>Schnell! Schnell!</i>
<i>Schnell! Schnell!</i>
Range, 1,500 yards.
Range, 1,500 yards.
Ready?
Ready.
Fire!
Fire!
"Happy birthday, Adolf"?
<i>Schweinhund! Schweinhund!</i>
KLINK:
I know where every
prisoner is at all times!
KEITEL:
I am sorry
to disagree with you, Colonel,
but I happen to know
that every one of <i>my</i> men
is thoroughly reliable.
KLINK:
The fact remains, Major...
That's what
I like to hear.
They're fighting amongst
themselves now.
...and got away because <i>you</i>
were unable to stop them.
And I say, it is because your
prisoners sabotaged my guns.
Hah! That's ridiculous.
All of my prisoners were
accounted for at roll call.
You asked for a working
party. I gave you one.
Did they do a good job?
Yes.
Good.
But that is not
the point.
Good! That ends the matter
as far as I'm concerned.
Dismissed.
Yes, sir.
But I assure you,
Berlin will favor
my version of this affair.
The nerve of that man,
trying to shift the blame
for his own inefficiency.
The Third Reich has no
place for a man like that.
Sounds like
a drinking problem.
Undoubtedly.
By the way, Colonel,
I understand that
your working party
did an excellent job in
cleaning up the gun battery.
Thank you.
During my inspection
this morning, I noticed
that our own buildings
could use some
extra repair work.
Request denied.
I offer one extra hour
of electric light,
and one more slice of
bread per man a week.
Two extra
hours of light,
and two
slices of bread.
One and a half
extra hours of light,
and one and a quarter
slices of bread...
