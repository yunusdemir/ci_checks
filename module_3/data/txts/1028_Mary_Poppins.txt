A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

Good luck will rub off

Room here for everyone
Gather around
Hello, Miss Lark
I got one for you
Ah, Mrs Cory
A story for you
Dear Miss Persimmon...
Wind's in the east
Mist comin' in
Like something is brewin'
About to begin
Can't put me finger
on what lies in store
But I feel what's to happen
All happened before
Our daughter's daughters will adore us
And we'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"
We're clearly soldiers in petticoats
And dauntless crusaders
for women's votes
Though we adore men individually
We agree that as a group
they're rather stupid
Cast off the shackles of yesterday
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray
Our daughter's daughters will adore us
And they'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"
From Kensington to Billingsgate
One hears the restless cries
From every corner of the land
Womankind, arise
Political equality
and equal rights with men
Take heart, for Mrs Pankhurst
has been clapped in irons again
No more the meek
and mild subservients we
We're fighting for our rights militantly
Never you fear
So cast off the shackles of yesterday
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray
Our daughter's daughters will adore us
And they'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done"
I feel a surge of deep satisfaction
Much as a king astride his noble steed
When I return from daily strife
to hearth and wife
How pleasant is the life I lead
I run my home precisely on schedule
At 6:01, I march through my door
My slippers, sherry, and pipe
are due at 6:02
Consistent is the life I lead
It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910
King Edward's on the throne
It's the age of men
I'm the lord of my castle
The sovereign, the liege
I treat my subjects
servants, children, wife
With a firm, but gentle hand
Noblesse oblige
It's 6:03, and the heirs to my dominion
are scrubbed and tubbed
And adequately fed
And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed
Ah, lordly is the life I lead
A British nanny must be a general
The future empire lies within her hands
And so the person that we need
to mould the breed
It is a nanny who can give commands
A British bank is run with precision
A British home requires nothing less
Tradition, discipline, and rules
must be the tools
Without them
disorder, catastrophe, anarchy
In short, you have a ghastly mess
"If you want this choice position
"Have a cheery disposition"
"Rosy cheeks, no warts
"Play games, all sorts
"You must be kind
"You must be witty
"Very sweet and fairly pretty"
"Take us on outings, give us treats
"Sing songs, bring sweets
"Never be cross or cruel
"Never give us castor oil or gruel
"Love us as a son and daughter
"And never smell of barley water"
"If you won't scold and dominate us
"We will never give you
cause to hate us
"We won't hide your spectacles
so you can't see
"Put toads in your bed
or pepper in your tea
"Hurry, nanny
"Many thanks
"Sincerely
"Jane and Michael Banks"
And every task you undertake
becomes a piece of cake
A lark, a spree
It's very clear to see
That a
spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
A robin feathering his nest
has very little time to rest
While gathering
his bits of twine and twig
Though quite intent in his pursuit
He has a merry tune to toot
He knows a song
Will move the job along
For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
The honeybees that fetch the nectar
from the flowers to the comb
Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro
Because they take a little nip
from every flower that they sip
And hence
They find
Their task is not a grind
Their task is not a grind
Aaah
For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down
Medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down
In the most delightful way

I does what I likes and I likes...
What I do
Today I'm a screever
And as you can see
A screever's an artist
Of highest degree
And it's all me own work
from me own memory
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo
I draws what I likes
and I likes what I drew
No remuneration do I ask of you
But me cap would be glad
of a copper or two
Me cap would be glad
of a copper or two
Ain't it a glorious day
Right as a mornin' in May
I feel like I could fly
Have you ever seen
the grass so green
Or a bluer sky
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary
Mary makes your heart so light
When the day is grey and ordinary
Mary makes the sun shine bright
Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her
The daffodils are smiling at the dove
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band
It's a jolly holiday with Mary
No wonder that it's Mary that we love
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary
Mary makes your heart so light
When the day is grey and ordinary
Mary makes the sun shine bright
Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her
The daffodils are smiling
at the dove, oink, oink
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band
It's a jolly holiday with Mary
No wonder that it's Mary that we love
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
Gentlemen like you are few
Though you're just
a diamond in the rough, Bert
Underneath your blood is blue
You'd never think
of pressing your advantage
Forbearance
is the hallmark of your creed
A lady needn't fear
when you are near
Your sweet gentility is crystal clear
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert
A jolly, jolly holiday with you
We'll start with raspberry ice
And then some cakes and tea
Order what you will
There'll be no bill
It's complimentary
Mavis and Sybil
have ways that are winning
And Prudence and Gwendolyn
set your heart spinnin'
Phoebe's delightful
Maude is disarming
Felicia, Janice and Lydia
Charming!
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet
Stephanie's smashing, Priscilla a treat
Veronica, Millicent, Agnes, and Jane
Convivial company, time and again
Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts
I'll agree are three jolly good sports
But cream of the crop, tip of the top
is Mary Poppins and there we stop
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band
It's a jolly holiday with Mary
No wonder that it's Mary that we love
It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Um diddle diddle diddle
um diddle ay
'Cause I was afraid to speak
when I was just a lad
Me father gave me nose a tweak
and told me I was bad
But then one day I learned a word
that saved me aching nose
The biggest word you ever heard
and this is how it goes
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Um diddle diddle diddle
um diddle ay
He travelled all around the world
And everywhere he went
He'd use his word and all would say,
"There goes a clever gent"
When dukes and maharajas
pass the time of day with me
I say me special word
and then they ask me out to tea
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
So when the cat has got your tongue
There's no need for dismay
Just summon up this word
and then you've got a lot to say
But better use it carefully
or it could change your life
She's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy

Stay awake
Don't rest your head
Don't lie down
Upon your bed
While the moon
Drifts in the skies
Stay awake
Don't close
Your eyes
Though the world
Is fast asleep
Though your pillow's
Soft and deep
You're not sleepy
As you seem
Stay awake
Don't nod and dream
Stay awake
Don't nod
And dream
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

I love to laugh
Loud and long and clear
I love to laugh
It's getting worse every year
The more I laugh
The more I fill with glee
The more the glee
The more I'm a merrier me
Some people
laugh through their noses
Sounding something like this
Some people laugh through their teeth
Goodness sakes
Hissing and fizzing like snakes
Some laugh too fast
Some only blast
Others they twitter like birds
Then there's that kind
what can't make up their mind
When things strike me as funny
I can't hide it inside
And squeak, hee,
as the squeakelers do
I've got to let go
With a ho ho ho ho
And a ho ho ho, hoo!
We love to laugh
Loud and long and clear
We love to laugh
So everybody can hear
The more you laugh
We fill with glee
And the more the glee
The more we're a merrier we
A British bank is run with precision
A British home requires nothing less
Tradition, discipline, and rules
must be the tools
Without them
disorder, chaos, moral disintegration
In short, you have a ghastly mess
The children must be
moulded, shaped and taught
That life's a looming battle
to be faced and fought
If they must go on outings
These outings ought to be fraught
with purpose, yes, and practicality
These silly words like
And popping through pictures
have little use, fulfil no basic need
They've got to learn the honest truth
Despite their youth
They must learn
About the life you lead
They must feel the thrill
of totting up a balanced book
A thousand ciphers neatly in a row
When gazing at a graph
that shows the profits up
Their little cup of joy should overflow
It's time they learned
to walk in your footsteps
To tread your straight
and narrow path with pride
Tomorrow, just as you suggest
Pressed and dressed
Jane and Michael will be at your side
Early each day
to the steps of St. Paul's
The little old bird woman comes
In her own special way
to the people she calls
Come buy my bags full of crumbs
Come feed the little birds
Show them you care
And you'll be glad if you do
Their young ones are hungry
Their nests are so bare
All it takes is tuppence
From you
Feed the birds
Tuppence a bag
Tuppence, tuppence
Tuppence a bag
Feed the birds
That's what she cries
While overhead, her birds fill the skies
All around the cathedral
The saints and apostles
Look down as she sells her wares
Although you can't see it
You know they are smiling
Each time someone shows
That he cares
Though her words are simple and few
Listen, listen
She's calling to you
Feed the birds
Tuppence a bag
Tuppence, tuppence
Tuppence a bag
Though her words are simple and few
Listen, listen
She's calling to you
Feed the birds
Tuppence a bag
Tuppence
Tuppence a bag
If you invest your tuppence
wisely in the bank
Safe and sound
Soon that tuppence
Safely invested in the bank
Will compound
And you'll achieve
that sense of conquest
As your affluence expands
In the hands of the directors
Who invest
As propriety demands
Plantations of ripening tea
All from
Tuppence
Prudently, thriftily, frugally
invested in the...
To be specific
In the Dawes, Tomes, Mousley, Grubbs
Fidelity Fiduciary bank
When you deposit
tuppence in a bank account
Soon you'll see
That it blooms
into credit of a generous amount
Semiannually
And you'll achieve that sense of stature
As your influence expands
To the high financial strata
That established credit now commands
Tuppence
Patiently
Cautiously
Trustingly invested in the...

Chim chim cheree
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo
Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you
Or blow me a kiss
And that's lucky, too
Now as the ladder of life
has been strung
You might think a sweep's
on the bottommost rung
Though I spends me time
in the ashes and smoke
In this whole wide world
there's no happier bloke
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo
Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo
Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you
I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do
A broom for the shaft
And a brush for the flue
Up where the smoke
is all billowed and curled
'Tween pavement and stars
Is the chimney sweep world
When there's hardly no day
Nor hardly no night
There's things half in shadow
And halfway in light
On the rooftops of London
Coo, what a sight
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree
When you're with a sweep
You're in glad company
Nowhere is there a more happier crew
Than them what sings
Chim chim cheree, chim cheroo
Chim chiminy chim chim
Cheree chim cheroo
Step in time, step in time
Step in time, step in time
Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme
Step in time, we step in time
Kick your knees up, step in time
Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme
Kick your knees up, step in time
Round the chimney, step in time
Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme
Round the chimney, step in time
Flap like a birdie, step in time
Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme
Flap like a birdie, in time
Up on the railing, step in time
Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme
Up on the railing, step in time
Over the rooftops, step in time
Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme
Step in time
Over the rooftops, over the rooftops
Link your elbows, step in time
Link your elbows, link your elbows
Link your elbows
Step in time, step in time
Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme
When you step in time
You step in time
They're at it again, step in time
At it again, step in time
They're at it again, step in time
Ow! Step in time
Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme
Step in time
Votes for women, step in time
Votes for women
It's the master, step in time
It's the master
What's all this, what's all this
What's all this
Link your elbows, step in time
Kick your knees up
Kick your knees up...
Before the mortar of his zeal
Has a chance to congeal
My world was calm
Well ordered...
Then came this person
With chaos in her wake
And now my life's ambitions go
With one fell blow
It's quite a bitter pill
To take
A spoonful of sugar
That is all it takes
It changes bread and water into
Tea and cakes
A spoonful of sugar
Goes a long, long way
Have yourself a healthy helpin'
Every day
And when your little tykes are cryin'
You haven't time to dry their tears
And see them grateful little faces
Smilin' up at you
Because their dad
He always knows just what to do
You've got to grind, grind, grind
At that grindstone
Though childhood slips
Like sand
Through a sieve
And all too soon
They've up and grown
And then they've flown
And it's too late for you to give
Just that spoonful of sugar
To help the medicine
Go down
The medicine go down
Medicine go down
A spoonful of sugar
Makes the medicine go down
The medicine go down
The medicine...
The medicine go down
Just a spoonful...
Just a spoonful of sugar
Makes the medicine go down
A spoonful of sugar
Makes the medicine go down
With tuppence for paper and strings
You can have your own set of wings
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in flight
With your fist holding tight
To the string of your kite
Oh, oh, oh
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite
And send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite
And send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite
When you send it flying up there
All at once you're lighter than air
You can dance on the breeze
Over houses and trees
With your fist holding tight
To the string of your kite
Oh, oh, oh
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite
And send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go
Fly a kite
Oh, oh, oh
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height
Let's go fly a kite
And send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go
Fly a kite
