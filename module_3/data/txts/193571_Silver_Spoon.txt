It's bad that mixed feeds are expensive.
- You raise cows at your place?
- No, chickens. How about you?
You add phytase then...
There's newcastle disease and avian influenza...
The body condition at the last stage of lactation is...
With the current trisaminomethane...
There's 90% mortality rate when it's infected with a virulent type...
Ours is almost 4.0.
Our main breadwinners are Jersey and Brown Swiss cattles.
I don't know much about the Holstein breeds.
Then do you make butter and cheese?
You'll have to mix with a diluting agent with that.
From now on, you will be boarding students and are encouraged to study.
And you will receive agricultural training.
This school teaches general agriculture, dairy farming,
food science, forestry, agricultural engineering and other disciplines.
Since there will be many training activities in dairy science,
you will have no vacation basically.
What's wrong?
I'm Ichirou Komaba from Shimizu Daiichi Middle School.
I'm going to take over the family dairy farm after graduation.
I'm Mayumi Yoshino from Shimourahorou Middle School.
Um, taking advantage of what I will learn from Ooezo Agricultural High School,
I want to start a cheese factory using my family's dairy farm.
I'm Tamako Inada from Obihirokawa West Central Middle School.
I'm going to study Agricultural Management so I can run a world class farm.
Also, I want to make my own brand of an innovative milk that...
Hachiken.
Can you teach me this topic?
Sorry. Can you just ask someone else?
Um, it's just a little thing.
I'm also having a hard time here.
Stop disturbing me.
Ah... right...
Raise your hand if you're done.
Come on. This is an easy question.
Ah! Aaah!
Aaaah!
Ah. I'm okay. I'm oky.
Excuse me.
Is there any point in taking the entrance exams?
You got in because it's an affliated school.
Why do you have to go to a school that far?
You see, the homeroom teacher said that this school is perfect for Yuugo.
What's the point of growing crops and be in contact with farm animals?
Will you be satisfied running away to this school?
To think you studied hard.
Since you can't get better results
this time, you're planning to run away?
I'm...
...done for.
In that case,
I won't expect anything from you.
Okay, next.
Hey.
Ah. Yes, sir.
Umm...
I'm Yuugo Hachiken.
Nice to meet you all.
What about your middle school and plans after graduating?
Sorry.
Um, I'm from New Sapporo Middle School.
I have no plans in particular when I graduate.
- You have one right?
- I don't.
No way! To think you're a hottie.
So you came from a prep school, huh?
New Sapporo Mids is known for super intelligent peeps.
Guess so.
What do you mean you have no plans for the future?
What do you mean?
For someone like you going to this particular school, there's no way you have none.
Like you like animals or love nature to be an environmentalist.
There's a reason, right?
Sorry. None at all.
Then why this school?
This is a boarding school. I can leave home.
Sounds like an easy life.
You think dairy is easy?
It's not like that.
Dairy isn't that easy as you think, you know.
Hey! Wash your hands!
Hey! Freshman! Catch it!
- Just catch it quick!
- Oh! Okay!
What's going on?
Ah! You guys! Help me quick!
Ah! Gotcha!
Stay still!
Waah! Go away!
Wait! For real?!
Here you go.
Thanks. Okay, ouch ouch.
You're Hachiken, right?
Huh? Yeah.
And you are...
I'm Mikage. Nice to meet you.
Likewise.
It's a good looking chicken.
If you look at it closely,
- it's really cute.
- it looks delicious.
I was on the way to the poultry house and found the cages were broken.
I panicked.
You really saved us the trouble.
I'll give you some smoked chicken later as thanks.
Oh~ Awesome!
Come to think of it, you're good at catching chickens.
That's because poultry is our family business.
That's why. So you're going to succeed the business then.
Yeah, I guess so.
Should we go and return them to the cages?
- Yeah.
- Gotcha.
Wait. Not that.
Okay.
You look clumsy but you're quite good catching one.
Not really. A girl named Mikage caught it for me.
- Ah, Aki.
- You know her?
Kinda. We came from the same middle school.
I see... You two did it?
- Don't be silly.
- So you did it?
- No.
- You're kidding.
- Aki Mikage.
- Let's go then.
- Wah!
- Sorry.
- My shirt!
- Sorry, sorry.
Give me a break!
- Hey!
- Hey! Hey! You okay?
Really?
Get up, Hachiken!
Okay, wake up quick.
Hey get up! We're gonna be late.
- The dairy department sure is early.
- I guess so.
Come on, wake him quietly!
We'll wake up too.
Oh, shuddap.
Heey! Get up!
Come on, Hachiken. Hurry.
- You're late
- It's already past 5.
'Cause this guy ain't getting up.
Say, everyone didn't slept well, huh?
Well, I sleep during class.
That's nothing to be proud of.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- What the.
- It's this way.
- Ah, that way. Sorry.
At least remember the road. You're smart, right?
It was not intentional.
Hey, what are you doing? You're making a mess.
Feed tray is over there. For Pete's sake.
My bad.
Huh?
Is that cow going to be moved somewhere else?
It doesn't get pregnant at all so they're going to dispose it.
Dispose?! Really? It sounds cruel.
What nonsense are you talking about?
Agriculture is not charity work.
Pigs has a keen sense of smell
Their ability to remember things based on smell is among the best in the animal kingdom.
It even allows them to move in the dark.
It even allows them to move in the dark.
They also have very powerful jaws. They can easily take off a person's finger with a single bite.
Let's now go to the nursing station.
How adorable! Look how they breastfeed.
This is where we take care of the mother pig and the piglets.
You first years will be taking care of these pigs for awhile.
Ah. The piglet at the end, it's small and it's so cute.
Cute~
A pig's nipple closest to the back releases milk the worst.
This little one lost the competition and ended up at the back.
I see.
Poor little thing.
When piglets have chosen a place,
even if there are better ones, they'll stay right where they are.
If the piglet lost in the first competition,
it would settle at the position.
Don't you do the same.
Yes, ma'am...
Okay. Since you are the (hachi)8th place in a litter of 8,
I'll call you Eight/Hachi.
It's a bad idea to give it a name.
You know livestocks are not pets.
Nothing good will come if you treat them special.
That's right. Before you know it, it will be turned into a pork bowl.
Then, I'll just name it 'Pork Bowl'.
Not bad.
I've decided! I'm going to raise you into a fine pig.
Let's be great friends for the next three years, Pork Bowl!
What are you talking about? They will be shipped out by fall.
What?!
Is that a joke?
Huh?
The piglet was too cute so you can't eat the gingered grilled pork now?
It's not like that at all.
Then eat it.
I will.
Come on, eat it.
I'll just eat at my own pace.
It doesn't matter if he eats pork or not.
Yeah, it's alright if you don't never pork again.
Guys, stop it.
- Come on, eat it.
- Then, I won't eat it!
- Don't be a baby.
- So you're a baby.
Hey, Hachiken.
They don't mean to insult, you know.
Though I've felt that everyone doesn't like me since they found out I came from a prep school.
What's so great that your family is running a dairy farm?
Come on, don't get irritated over it.
I'm not really getting irritated over it.
Yeah. Say, that spoon over there.
I've been wondering what that is.
Hmm... I wonder. A talisman?
No, that's for ninja. That's got nothing to do with a talisman.
Geez...
- Hey, that's Komaba.
- It's Komaba.
- He's so cool.
- So hot.
Is one lap at the school grounds this vast?
It feels like I've been running for 5 kilometers already.
This school's lot area is the largest in the country.
One lap comes out to be 20 kilometers.
20?! It's the size of a half marathon!
Would a normal athletics subject do this?!
I'll go on ahead.
Hey! Hachiken! You're dead last!
Stop dragging your feet and run!
I want to quit this school...
Go! Run!
Hachiken?
- You were still running?
- Yeah.
You have poor physical strength.
Everyone else went ahead to their clubs.
To extracurricular clubs from this? Are they monsters?
Why don't you also join a club? You're not into one, right?
No, no. I'll pass.
How about the equestrian club?
I don't know...
But I do think it would fit you.
But you see...
It's fun! Once you ride a horse
it trots where you run with the wind then
you feel your surroundings becomes huge then
it really feels so good!
D-d-does it feel good?
Yup!
But, you see...
- I'm done.
- Good.
Um... I'll be in your care.
- Let's work together.
- Let's get along.
Ah right. I forgot to say this to you...
The equestrian club takes care of horses so you need to be here by 4AM everyday.
No way!
- Yes way~
- What?
Ride leading the way than by volume.
Okay, turn in the corner to reverse.
The last component of a fertilizer is potassium.
The potassium is important for the development of the roots.
It is used for permeation adjustment in the cells.
Other than that, diseases...
Deeper.
Now, keep your back straight.
Okay.
Let's! (Let's!) Go! Let's go! Go!
Later!
Bye bye!
So you're hear. I've been looking for you.
Look at him Mikage. Isn't he really cute?
Yeah. It's true he's cute.
Hm? Why were you looking for me?
Ah right. Are you free tomorrow?
Huh? Yeah.
We're finally having a day off. Do want to go somewhere fun together?
Huh? Really?
I'll go! Where do you want to go?
It's already set.
Oh I see. Where?
- Then I'll give you a clue.
- Okay.
Right after passing the gate, you'll feel it's a place full of dreams .
Hm? Where is that?
- Then next clue.
- Okay.
There's a mascot of a cartoon character there.
Ah! That's right. I got it!
But isn't Chiba far?
Hm? Chiba?
Yeah. That place you're talking about is in Tokyo but that's Chiba.
- Hm?
- Yeah. It's Chiba.
Announcing the refund of the 10th race.
Betting numbers 1 to 8, receives 1490 yen.
Hachiken.
Sorry for the wait.
Say, this is a racetruck, right?
Yup. Ban'ei racing.
It's alright that us high school students just watch.
Yeah, I know that...
You know, my uncle's horse will enter the race today.
- I see.
- Yup.
What?
Ah. Icchan!
Wait. I thought it was just us two.
Huh? Why?
Nevermind.
What? So he's here to.
Huh?
Okay, everyone's here. Let's go!
The horses simultaneously starts entry.
9 horses enters with a good start.
Go! Mikagehomare!
- Which one's yours?
- Number 4, 4.
- They'r slow.
Ban'ei racing is a unique horse racing in the world.
- Amazing, right?
- Oh. Really?
They are now entering the 2nd obstacle of the race.
They stopped.
They can't climb if they don't conserve strength.
- Wow!
- Go!
Amazing right?
That's amazing! How heavy are those sleds?
- About 480 kilograms.
- Really?!
Go! Mikagehomare!
No. 4, Mikagehomare is leading the race.
Mikagehomare is leading.
Behind it, No. 7, DoRoyal is closing in.
The difference is about 3 and a half horse length.
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Come on! Almost there!
DoRoyal is behind Mikagehomare...
Ah! Your horse finishes first!
Not yet. The sled hasn't passed through yet.
- Go Mikagehomare!
- Go!
- Staying behind, the other horses reaches goal!
- Aaah!
Alright!
Ah. Ayame.
Ah, if it isn't Aki Mikage. What are you doing in a place like this?
- I came to cheer on Mikagehomari
- I see.
Sorry that our DoRoyal goes first.
Wait. Did you gained weight?
What? I haven't changed!
I see. But you completely lost your cuteness.
Whaat? No way! I'm shocked!
What "I'm shocked"? Makes me sick. It sounds like you're flirting.
Komaba!
Long time no see! Did you grow taller?
I didn't.
What? You became hot! Really!
Hm? Who's this four-eyes?
You eat slow, four-eyes.
Stop that.
By the way, who's that rude girl awhile ago?
Just some idiot that was our classmate during middle school.
Hey, hey.
- But she's an idiot.
- Hey, hey, hey.
But it really was so close.
Just a little bit and it would have won.
I'm still glad it placed  third.
It can live for a while for now.
Hm? What do you mean.
If the results were bad, it will be forced to retire and will be killed for horse meat.
What? To think it's doing its best and he'll just get eaten?
There's no such thing as working hard when you're a livestock.
Results are everything.
But...
I don't like it that working hard means nothing.
There's nothing you can do even if you say that.
Even the chickens you caught the other day
They weren't laying eggs so they were made into smoked chicken.
It's like that chicken curry you're eating now.
You're normally just eating them without thinking.
Stop sympathizing them if you're acting the other way around.
It's just that...
I'm just saying that not everything can be decided by results.
You can say naive things like that because you have no dairy farm.
Then do you understand the depth of a thanklesss hard work?
Huh? What the hell?
You guys who didn't live in a competitive society got it easy.
Huh?
If you are born with a dairy farm, you can enter high school without studying hard
then after graduating, you'll just have to inherit the business right?
You can't understand the feeling that you are being cut out when having bad results, huh?
I envy your laid-back life.
- What'd you say?!
- What?
Stop it, you two.
Come on. Let's go to my uncle's stables, okay?
I'll pass. I'm leaving.
I wanted you to get along with Icchan.
Sorry.
But it's his fault that he started to pick a fight.
Stop it.
But Icchan has a lot of things he worries about.
He's on his limits.
Worries?
Ah. Uncle!
Oh, Aki. Long time no see.
- Yeah.
- Hm?
Did you gained weight?
- Geez!
- What? Why me?
I want to try Ban'ei Racing too.
It would be hard just trying to run it straight if it's you.
You won't know that until I try it, right?
You really like horses.
Yup. I like them.
I love them.
Ah then, are you thinking of working with horses after graduating?
Ah... not really...
Well, Aki has to succeed brother's farm.
Yeah. I intend to.
Huh? Is that a new horse?
Ah. It's just two years old and recently got in.
How cute! What's its name?
I haven't decided but
I'm thinking of naming it "Titanic".
Ah! Sounds like a gorgeous name.
But in the end, it sunk right?
- Ah right.
- Yes.
I kinda already decided to name it "Titanic".
But it sunk.
Then how about "Unsinking Titanic"?
I think it's best you drop Titanic all together.
Then, you think of its name.
- It's alright I name it?
- Sure.
Alright! Isn't it awesome that I'll be a godmother?
Let's think of a name together.
Excuse me, but what is that?
Is it someone's funeral?
A racehorse died yesterday.
They have a funeral like humans?
No. Rarely.
Well, managing is hard wherever.
Then it has probably been one great horse.
No. I don't think it had great results.
Huh? Then why?
An excellent horse even if its results fell slightly, will be made into horse meat.
But isn't it wonderful that even though it had bad results, there are people who really love them till the end.
Ah! Headmaster.
What's this?
Hey Hachiken! Shout out when dropping these!
I'm sorry.
Isn't Hachiken the student from the prep school?
Yes.
It's been awhile since I've toured the place and had a bad day.
I'm really sorry.
It's okay.
Hachiken, what kind of career are you thinking coming here at Ezo Ag?
Ah. Um. About that...
- I'm sorry.
- Hm?
I don't have a dream or anything like that.
Oh, you have no dreams.
That sounds alright.
Huh? That's alright?
I'm looking forward of what he'll become. Right, Mr. Nakajima?
Yes.
Summer vacation will start next week.
But spend it with a goal.
Tokiwa, you're going to be alright?
Yes! I'm going to Tokyo this summer vacation.
Then seduce someone to be my girlfriend!
I see. You don't need to go back here.
Huh? Huh? Why?
Hey, Hachiken. Are you going home this summer vacation?
No. I have no plans to go home.
Really? Then can you come to my place?
Huh?
My parents won't be there for awhile too.
Ah, you see. That's quite, you know...
I'm looking for someone to work for us.
Ah. It's just work.
So you need someone for manual labor.
Hm? What?
It's nothing.
My father needs to get surgery for his hernia.
We're looking for someone who can take care of the cows and the horses.
Ah! You'll get paid.
- Really?
- Yup.
Okay. I'll do it.
I see. Then we should contact your parents.
I'll tell them later our contact details.
It's alright. I'll be the one to tell them.
But we should be the one that tell them.
It's really okay. I'll do it.
Okay. Careful now. Steady.
- Oh, you're going already?
- Yeah.
Pleased to meet you. I'm Yuugo Hachiken.
I heard you're not from a farmer's family?
Ah. Yes. My father is an office worker.
Really?
Then he fits to be Aki's husband!
What are you saying, grandma!
Don't lay a hand on her while I'm not here!
Aki will inherit the farm.
It's better to choose Aki's husband sooner than later!
Don't do anything. I'll be right back!
- Yes sir.
- Come on, just get in.
- Okay. Here.
- Take care!
- Okay, we're leaving!
- Don't lay a hand on her!
Okay, you're in.
Aki!
Teach Hachiken how to clean the stables.
Hachiken is in the equestrian club so he knows how.
- Oh, I see.
- Yup.
- Then, I'll leave it to you.
- Okay.
Huh? Isn't it a Ban'ei horse?
Yeah. It's named King.
I see. So can it enter a race?
Yeah. If it has an opportunity to.
Say, do you have a second thoughts on succeeding the farm?
Why do you ask?
It's nothing. Just thought about it.
The truth is
I want to work with horses.
Thought so. If that's the case-
I'm an only child.
I don't want to put down my family's expectations of me.
Hachiken.
Yes?
You can now take a bath. It's free.
- Oh okay.
- Okay.
- Aki.
- Yes?
- ...them?
- What?
Wait, what?
What?
Grandpa is asking if you already called your parents.
Huh? Not yet.
You haven't?
You should not make your parents worry.
Okay.
Okay.
This time, you're running away?
If that's the case, I won't expect anything from you.
It would be better if I can see you every day even if summer vacation is over.
What? Does that mean?
- Right, King?
- Ah. The horse.
Come on. Come on.
Good boy.
- Hachiken.
- Yes?
Can you deliver this to the neighbor?
Yes, ma'am.
Vegetables slowly lose their sugar content from the moment they got picked out so hurry.
Understood.
- Then I'll leave it to you.
- Yes, ma'am.
Ah. Which way is the neighbor's?
Icchan's place is the building from a corner over there.
Huh? Your neighbor is Komaba?
Yeah.
Komaba's place, huh?
Should I go?
Um... Nah. This is also work.
Yeah. I'll be going then.
Okay.
Ah! Bicycle!
How far is that neighbor?
That bastard Komaba. At least get your own vegetables.
- Hokkaido!
- Whoa!
Nippon-Ham Fighters!
That surprised me!
Though that's rarer than a bear.
So you were here.
Aki called saying I should search for you.
My bad.
Hey, found him.
You were walking?
- Far isn't it?
- Yeah.
Even though we're neighbors, it's 8 kilometers far.
Looks like it. I've underestimated Obihiro.
These are my sisters.
Good evening.
You should greet back.
Good evening.
Do you girls know Labor Standards Act?
Don't tell them nonsense.
It's normal for kids born in farm houses to help out at this age.
Really?
That's right.
We don't have money to hire people so it's hard all year round.
To also think that our cows are old so it's hard to get milk.
I see.
Huh? You aren't going to dispose the cows?
Well, my mother's taking good care of them.
Even if there's a little accident, we won't get rid of them.
But you said before that agriculture is not charity.
Yeah, I said that.
That's why we're having a hard time.
I see. That's how it was.
Um. Can I also help?
Sure.
- Can I give these to them too?
- Yup.
Want raw milk?
Okay.
Non-pasteurized milk doesn't sell well.
But it's your own responsibility to drink this.
I'm okay with that. Thanks.
Whoa! This is good!
You're overreacting.
But it's really good.
Only your mother works for your cowshed?
Yeah.
My father overdid it I guess.
He died of overworking.
Since then, it was only my mother who works here.
That's why without me, there won't be anyone else.
- I see.
- Yeah.
After I graduate, I'll work hard and pay our loans.
I want to send my sisters to college.
I want to make my mother have an easier life.
Sorry.
I said before that people who just succeed in their family business got it easy.
I also said too much.
Okay. Okay.
Let's go. Here. Here.
- Go, go.
- Go, go.
- Okay, let's go. Go. Go.
Welcome back, dad! Welcome home!
- I'm a lot better now.
- Nice to see you again.
I'm sorry!
- Hey, here's a coffee.
- Yes.
Whoa! What the hell are you doing?!
I'm sorry!
Grandpa! The tap is loose!
The milk is spilling!
- What?!
- Grandpa! Quick!
I'm really sorry.
I forgot to close it before milking the cows.
So about 500 liters were wasted.
I'm really very sorry.
Well, what's done is done.
Let's just get back to work.
Let's hurry and milk the rest of the herd or they might get mastitis.
Okay.
I'll do it. You two get these cleaned up.
Yes, sir.
Um, how much does milk cost?
Don't worry about it.
It's 500 liters. I'll worry about it.
How much?
Hmm... the purchase price is 83 yen per liter I think.
So we just lost 41.5 thousand yen?
You compute fast.
Then if you deduct the overhead costs like feed cost in the milk
not much of that will make it to the farmers.
That's right. That's why it's tough.
Yeah...
Geez. That's why don't worry about it.
Okay?
Drink some tea.
Thank you very much.
Hachiken. You were a great help during this summer vacation.
Thank you.
Thank you too. I learned a lot working here.
This is not much but here's your pay.
I...
...can't take it.
Why?
It's just that, I wasted so much of a valuable product.
Just shut up and take it.
That money
is the proof that your work here is appreciated.
But...
Besides,
it's our fault for not checking properly.
Just take it. Buy something that is good for you.
Yeah.
I gratefully accept.
Be sure to eat this too.
Yes, ma'am.
It's sweet.
Sweet!
I was always busy in the fields.
Me too. I was working every day.
It's that time of the year, huh?
Long time no see!
That tickles!
Stop it!
You've stayed all summer at Mikage's, right?
Yeah, I guess so.
- Did you do it?
- No, I didn't.
You're kidding!
- You did it, right?
- I said, I didn't!
Really? Are you okay?
Shut up.
Boring~
Hey, Hachiken. Have you done it with Aki?
Huh? I said I didn't.
It's better if you do it soon. I think Aki's waiting for you.
There's such a thing?
There's such a thing or not,
today, you and Aki are on Pork Bowl's feeding duty.
Ah that. Oh no!
Good morning!
- You're late
- Sorry. Sorry.
What's wrong?
Pork Bowl is now a pig!
Pork bowl is a pig.
Wow. Pig's growth rate is amazing.
We can ship him out as scheduled.
Um, Ms. Fuji.
Can they be spared and not be made into pork then
No. They will be made into pork.
Right.
Today is the field trip for livestock operation.
This is where we will take the life of the animal until their carcass will be processed into meat.
No one will be forced to watch the whole process.
Only those who want to watch can come.
First, they're stunned using electric shock then be exanguiated.
Because if the heart stops, bloodletting will be incomplete, resulting in a poor-quality meat susceptible to degradation.
The peeling will be cut right below the skin.
The tongue will be pulled out by cutting the center of the lower jaw.
The head will be cut between the back of the skull and the first cervical vertebra.
Hm? Were you on duty today, Hachiken?
Ah no. I asked Ms. Fuji
that I will take care of Pork Bowl until shipment.
Why?
Because their shipment will be soon.
Something like that.
That's why I told you.
Nothing good will come if you treat livestock special.
I know but...
I can't be like you who can leave it like that.
Okay. But from my point of view, I can only see what you're doing is hypocrisy.
It may be hypocisy.
I can't just shake it off even if I understood.
I might regret it if I can't find the answer myself,
Okay.
- Mikage!
- Yes!
You can jump the obstacle!
Thank you!
Approaching vertical jump.
Okay!
Mikage! That ends today's obstacle.
Thank you!
Hachiken.
Huh? Yeah?
It'll be dangerous if you don't focus.
Stop thinking about Pork Bowl.
Right.
It sure grown up a lot.
- It's really amazing.
- Yeah.
Huh? Why is the feed box empty?
They're going to be shipped tomorrow. There is no need to feed them.
What?
We need to purge their digestive system before they're being processed.
So it's time to say goodbye.
It was a short time.
Hachiken.
- Ms. Fuji.
- There will be no changes in plans.
How much does a pig cost?
What will you do buying it? Will you take it as a pet?
How will you feed it? Where will you keep it?
You should stop it already.
I didn't say I'd buy Pork Bowl alive.
I'll buy Pork Bowl as meat.
You have the money?
I have money from my job.
Very well.
Sold.
Please separate out the meat from the pig marked with an "X".
Okay. That pig.
Um...
Please take good care of them.
- Ah. Thanks.
- Here.
Off it went.
Yeah.
Damn!
Are you sure you're going to eat Pork Bowl?
Yup.
I'll eat him.
You're making it hard for yourself.
I'm like an idiot.
Forget it. I want to eat him too.
So that's why.
Anyway, what's that?
Don't know him? It's the wrestler, "The Potato".
Who the hell's that?
This coming Ezo Ag Festival, the baseball club will have pro-wrestling.
You're the baseball club. Do baseball.
How about the equestrian club?
We'll be having something like an open barn.
Huh? Do something more exciting.
- Like Ban'ei racing.
- What?
Impossible.
Then how about acrobatics? You can make the horses stand up.
I can't even ride properly.
Acrobatics is impossible.
Okay. Boring!
Even if it's boring,
there are things we can and can't do.
She's like Super Potato!
Looking good!
Hachiken.
The pork arrived.
It became small.
It's 51 kilograms overall.
Market price is 496 yen per kilogram so...
- 25,296 yen.
- You calculate fast.
That's how much you cost.
It's cheap.
Oh. Hachiken.
What's up?
Hi. Can you teach me how to make bacon?
Tie it tightly.
- It slips sometimes.
- It's really slips.
- Okay. That's it.
- Got it.
When you were sweeping the waist, you were not lifting it hard enough.
- Yes sir.
- Lift harder!
Are you listening? Lift harder!
- Got it.
- Lift harder.
- Lift harder.
- Okay.
You can't sweep it properly so lift harder!
Lift harder.
Finally done.
Done?
Yes. It sure is hard work.
It's an unbelievable feat to finish 50 kilos by yourself.
Yeah.
Don't you smell something good?
Hey.
It's no good hiding. Let me have too.
Sure.
- There it is.
- Right.
- Here you go, headmaster.
- Looks good. Thank you.
Here.
- Thank you.
- Here, here.
Everyone has one?
You eat first, Hachiken.
Okay.
You became delicious, Pork Bowl.
- Let's dig in!
- Digging in!
It's good! Delicious!
It's good!
Delicious.
Yeah.
Hey! Eat these with bacon!
It's freshly picked!
There's rice too!
Where's the bacon?
Here.
Huh? Where's Komaba?
Oh right. I haven't seen him today.
Where is he?
Might as well give a portion to Komaba.
You should send a portion to your parents too.
Nah. I don't have to.
Hm? Send them some. I'm sure they'll like it.
No way they will.
My father is not interested with inconsistencies.
And he'll look down upon this kind of thing I've done.
It's all right if he look down to you.
You show him what you're made of.
Excuse me. Please send this parcel.
Okay, sure. Here, here, here.
The question number 1.
What's the meaning of winning two games for Japanese people?
- Mr. Miyashita.
- Yes.
Please answer the question.
These were Japan's first wins in an overseas World Cup.
That's right. Sit down, please.
These Were Japan's first wins in...
- Hey, Mikage.
- Hm?
Say, did something happen with you and Komaba?
It's just that Komaba's absent again.
I saw you crying last night.
Ah.
It's got nothing to do with you.
Got nothing to do with me?
What are you doing, sir?
Ah. If I don't polish silver, it will darken.
Is there any meaning to the silver spoon?
It's called the "Silver Spoon".
There's a foreign tradition that a newborn baby that is given a silver spoon will never go hungry.
If you can eat even if there is famine,
Then it's like people from farm families were born with silver spoon with them.
That what I hope.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Komaba isn't at school again today.
It's already a week.
You haven't heard?
About what?
Forget it, Tama.
What? Did something happened?
There was a formal request this morning for Komaba Ranch to give up their farm.
Give up their ranch?
It means they can't pay their debts. In other words, they're bankrupt.
Seems like he is also dropping out of school.
No way.
I see.
You knew about this, Mikage?
Why didn't you tell me?
You can't talk about someone else's bankruptcy lightly.
Besides, could you have done anything if she told you?
B-But...
Sorry.
Aki's family business also became the debt guarantor.
Will you be okay?
It's decided that I won't drop out of school.
But I think we would be selling the horses.
The horses? Even King?
Is there really anything we can do?
Well...
It is what it is.
It is what it is? But...
Let's stop this talk, okay?
We also had to keep up with the loan we used for our place's structure enlargement.
Oh man. It's really hard to be thrifty these days.
But it's common for dairy farmers to have debt these days.
What?
I thought no one will find me during class hours.
Are you really dropping out of school?
Guess so.
Don't give me that serious face. It's not rare one had to give up their farm.
Is there no way out of it?
It's not like I'm going way out of it, I'm doing something about it.
I can see that, but...
I have accepted the fact that I have to pay the debts.
Don't go yapping about it to me.
Yapping? But...
Forget about me. Take care of Aki.
Here's a farewell gift.
See you.
Okay, pep it up.
Be careful with the gaps.
Is that so...
If money's impossible, is there anything we can do?
I know what you feel.
But Komaba Ranch has finished the bankruptcy proceedings.
There's nothing we can do now.
Everyone's been saying there's nothing I can do or it is what it is that it made me angry.
There's nothing someone who run away from problems like me can do for Komaba.
Running away is a negative thing for you, huh?
Even if you were forced to run away
was the people you met after you ran away bad people?
No.
It's different from a lost farm animal.
It's alright if you run away to live.
So it's alright...
But what if you can't run away?
Komaba will be alright.
He is also a descendant of Hokkaido's cultivator's blood.
He won't lose heart that easily.
Cultivator's blood?
Yeah.
Since ancient times,
even if the crops are damaged from flood
even if their homes were overflown by the river
people here stand up whatever happens.
Komaba is the same.
He'll stand up whatever happens.
Don't underestimate the cultivator's spirit.
Hachiken! Jump the obstacle.
- Approaching the cross!
- Approaching the cross!
Ah. Isn't that Hachiken's first successful jump?
Yeah.
Here, here, here.
Mikage.
Let's debut King.
What?
Let's do Ban'ei racing at Ezo Ag's festival program.
You'll ride King.
That's impossible. Besides, I don't know how to say that to everyone.
It's alright. I'll convince them no matter what.
I want Komaba to see it too.
That you can do it if you try.
That anything is possible.
No, that's impossible!
I understand it's impossible. But Mr. President, please.
Okay. But I'm telling you it's impossible.
I understand. Please.
Are you listening?
- I'm listening. Please.
- You're not listening.
- Yes. Please.
- But, it's impossible.
- Please.
- Impossible.
- Please.
- It's impossible.
- We're not doing it.
- Please.
I see. Banba race, huh?
Yes.
We need 200 meters race course with two mountain obstacle course.
I see. How much hectares do you need?
Huh? Hectares? That's a bit...
Can you give us about 3 hectares?
Understood. How about the vacant lot at the back of the bio lab?
It would be easy for spectators to go there.
Okay.
I can let you use from there to there.
Really?! Alright! Thank you! Thank you!
Whoa. I get it, I get it.
What's that? His mistress?
That guy's hopeless.
Isn't this going to be very tough?
Yeah. My wrist hurts.
That's why I said this is impossible.
Hey, Hachiken! Listen!
I told him this is impossible.
Hey, Hachiken! He's not listening.
Hello, Ayame?
Ah. Mikage Aki. This is rare.
Doesn't your voice also gained weight?
Ah! No way! I'm shocked!
Ah, you see. I need your help.
What?
Hachiken! We can already call it a day, right?
Let's call it a day.
Okay.
My wrists hurt.
Your wrist? My waist hurts.
Harder, guys.
Yes, ma'am.
But be sure to don't get hurt.
My waist hurts.
It hurts.
Hey, you're knees are too hard. Relax it a bit.
Okay.
You're pulling the harness too hard. Loosen up.
Okay.
That's it. The knees should be relaxed.
Okay.
That's it.
Okay, this part.
Whoa. That was close.
Ah. I'm tired.
- It fell?
- I'm tired.
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. My waist. I broke my back.
I told you this is impossible!
Ah yes. Are your hands okay, Sakae?
It hurts, see.
Hey, we can't make it in time if we're like this.
- This is tough.
- Right.
Hey Hachiken! Get some rest too!
I'm alright. Just take a good rest.
Hachiken! This is impossible!
Oh my. Is Hachiken, okay?
- Hm?
- Look.
Huh?
Hachiken!
We're here to pay the bacon you treated us!
Hachiken! Let's do this! We've come to help!
Can you scrape off 70cm over here?
The first obstacle is done!
- Okay!
- It's done!
Roger that!
Thank you very much.
Then good luck in the race.
Good work! Good luck!
Okay! Thank you very much.
Okay.
Oh, why're you here?
Hey.
Here.
Is this Pork Bowl?
Yeah.
Looks delicious. Thanks.
Sure.
What are your plans, Komaba?
Well, I lost my dream to rebuild the ranch.
Once we sell off the rest of the cattles, I go find work.
I see.
Tell me if there is something I can do.
Don't worry about it. Anyway, what's going on with you?
Did you find anything you want to do?
Me? I'm just same as always.
I'm hopeless.
Even if there are many who works hard to make their dreams come true.
But well, that makes two of us who doesn't have dreams now.
But I've realized it recently
having no dreams
you can be anything you can be.
Yeah. I think so too.
- Komaba.
- Yeah?
I might not be able to do anything
but if you are looking for someone to talk to or listen to you complain
I can at least listen to you.
If you want to vent out, tell me anything.
Okay.
And also, I know that these are tough times for you
but tomorrow's Ezo Ag's festival, we're doing Ban'ei Race.
Really? You're doing Ban'ei race?
That's right. Come and see it.
You're amazing.
I told you to also do it.
Well.
Wait.
Wait. Wait.
Wait. Go!
Won't you try some Ezo Ag's milk?
Won't you try some Ezo Ag's milk?
It's only 200 yen each. Won't you try some?
You can eat them inside. How about it?
Come in. Come in.
- Please state your name.
- Hi! I'm Hanako Beppu!
I'll tell a joke!
There will be a Banba race by the Equestrian Club!
- Please come and watch.
- Please come.
Those who guessed the rankings corrects, they can get Ezo Ag's potatoes as prizes!
Please come and watch.
There will be a Banba race by the Equestrian Club!
Whoa. A lot of people came.
Thank goodness. I was wondering what I would do if no one came.
Ah. Hey!
Hachiken. I've finished painting the sled you asked me.
- Oh, you made it!
- Sorry, it took so long.
- Looking forward for the finished product.
- Let's go, let's go.
Let's go. Where?
Is it okay?
You said to paint it the way I like.
Yeah, I said that...
Ah, I thought so...
I should have painted the background with a darker pink. Sorry.
No, it's not the background.
What do you think?
Huh? It looks great. Right?
Huh? What? Yeah.
Looks good.
Thank goodness.
I was really worried about the background color.
Ayame.
Thank you for today.
I don't mind. I'm not doing it for you.
Anyway, I'll be sure to win with a big difference.
I'll leave it to you.
Leave it to us.
We will now commence Equestrian Club's Ban'ei Race.
The Ban'ei Race is the Hokkaido's cultivating era's...
- Sir Nakajima's so stiff.
- So funny!
Hey.
Hey, this.
Do I really have to wear this hanging with me?
Isn't a vertical signboard enough?
I can't do anything even if you tell me.
It's Hachiken's request.
Wear this first before riding. Here.
Let's do our best, King.
This race is with the cooperation of the high school equestrian clubs in the neighborhood.
What's with that sled? It looks bad.
Ah, you see, there were reasons that this is...
Your sled...
Isn't it beautiful?
I specifically made this from a designer from Paris.
I see.
Wow.
This is great.
Thank you for waiting patiently.
Now, Ooezo Agricultural High School
East Shikaoi High School, Shimizu Nishi HIgh School are on standby.
It's a competition between Equestrian Clubs to win the Ezo Ag Cup.
Each of the racer are now in place.
Please enjoy the intense competition of the high school jockeys.
Staff in charge of the horses have left their places.
Looks like everyone is ready.
It's finally race time.
Go!
Go!
You're doing great, Mikage!
Go!
This is amazing.
Mikage! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
Mikage! Go!
King! Go! Mikage!
Will the cows be eaten?

Mikage!
Steady! Steady!
- Go! Go!
- No! Keep your place!
- Go!
- Keep your place!
Are you being dumb?! She should just go!
Dumbass! The horse hasn't recovered yet!
- There's no crap as recovering!

Alright! Go! Go!

Go! Hey! Forward! Go!
Now! Mikage!
Go!
Go!
- Yes!
- Alright! She won!
She won!
Aki! You did it!
You did it, King.
Did Icchan go?
I see.
It's not like that!
My horse isn't in its best condition.
It had a fever of 38 degrees!
That's horses' normal temperature.
No... I mean...
It had a horse influenza? Or something like that.
Ayame.
Thanks for today.
Your family business might currently be in troubled times
I won't get worried at all for you.
I know that you are not that weak to lose heart.
That's why I will watch over you because you're my rival.
You two were amazing over there.
Thank you.
This is all thanks to Hachiken.
What? No, no, no, no. No way.
It's true.
It was possible. It was a lot of fun, Hachiken.
Hachiken.
Thank you deeply for your hard work.
- It was fun.
- Thank you.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
It's good.
I thank you everyone for the hel-
Isn't this the time to lift this guy in the air?!
- Nevermind that, you're ignored.
- Come on!
Then, how about we let him ride, King?!
Are you sure it's better if we don't see him?
Yes.
Whoa! Hail Hachiken!
It's really high!
He likes it! He loves it!
What are your plans? Do you want to pass by the school?
No, it's alright.
Get in.
Let's go then.
- Mom.
- Hm?
I think I can do it.
Then I'm happy.
Aki, I'm sorry.
It's alright. I'm a farmer's child.
They are not pets.
I exactly know the difference between farm animals.
Then, if you please.
Okay, then I'll be taking them.
We'll be going then.
Bye bye.
Mikage.
You know
after running away
I thought of facing my parents properly.
That's why
you should do it too.
You want to work with horses, right?
Pigs has a keen sense of smell.
Their ability to remember things based on smell is among the best in the animal kingdom.
Human harnessed horse race will now start.
First, the jockeys are in their first running obstacle.
Next, they have now reached their sleds...
One, two, go!
Hey. Long time no see.
Whoa. You look stronger.
Well, I have to pay the debts.
So how is your new ranch?
Yeah, they let my family live in the farm.
It was a great help Mr. Nakajima helped us find a good place.
That's good.
Yeah.
Next, trainee riders and equestrian students are to participate in this exhibition race.
Will it be okay?
It'll be fine. They practiced many times.
Heard you're the godparent?
Yup.
Open the gates!
- Mikage!
- Do it!
Go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go! Mikage!
Go, go, go!
Go! Silver Spoon!
