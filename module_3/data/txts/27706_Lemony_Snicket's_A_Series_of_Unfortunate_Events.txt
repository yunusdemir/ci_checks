- Sugar?
- No, thank you.
I always thought tea should
be bitter as wormwood
and sharp as a
double-edged sword.
I think you'll find
this sugar is extremely bitter.
I just love the opera!
Lemony, darling. Tea?
He's not listening.
When Beatrice is on, he
only has ears for her.
I wasn't sleeping! What did I miss?
Oh, good, they stopped singing.
And you stopped snoring.
Must you bring that
typewriter everywhere?
I'm new dramatic critic
for The Daily Punctilio.
Critic? Bah!
We theatrical types should be
complimented, not criticized.
You'll find this
interesting, Olaf.
"Theatrical" is a word which here
means "related to the theater,"
but it can also mean a person who
is prone to fits of melodrama.
My brother's defining
words again.
Let's hope it's a phase.
Oh! Look who's on.
Thank you.
As chief of your Official Fire Department,
I would like to take this intermission
to offer a few words about
fire safety, particularly
He's so embarrassing.
I think he looks noble.
- It may come as a surprise...
- The strong profile, the one eyebrow.
Runs in the family.
Where is Jacques? I miss that
knucklehead and his mustache.
He's driving his taxi tonight.
Matches, candles, arsonists...
Beatrice!
How was I?
You were radiant.
It's so wonderful to see
all of you together.
I should like to dedicate
these words to my wife,
who sadly perished in a fire,
and to my son, who is here
somewhere in the audience tonight.
I love you, Olaf.
Stay safe, and good night.
And now, back to the
tragedy you were watching.
The past haunts the present
the way a ghost might
haunt an opera house.
It hovers over it the way a murder
of crows might hover over a hotel.
Don't fire till you see the
white of the sugar bowl.
I can hit a blackbird flying
in the dead of night.
The past can hit
you like a rock,
and it can trap you like a
sticky piece of flypaper.
It can spin you in cycles
like a wet pair of pants.
And it can change you,
the way these next two minutes
would change my own life...
forever.
My name is Lemony Snicket.
Your name is Lemony? Snicket.
You look just like your mother.
I'm sorry, do we know you?
Somebody shot that manager
and he fell into the pond!
I saw it while I
was bird-watching!
Those concierges
shot the manager!
I saw it while I was
ironing my cummerbund!
We didn't do anything.
It was an accident.
They don't know that.
What can we do?
You can get in my taxi.
Sometimes when I'm in a
dangerous situation,
such as a public place where I'm being
accused of a murder that I did not commit,
I find it useful to get
away quickly in a taxi.
Where's Kit? She was
supposed to meet us.
I'm her brother. She
sent me to help you.
I can only help if you get
in this taxi right now.
Baudelaires!
Baudelaires!
I heard there was trouble, so I found
these friendly police officers.
We should leave before
those officers reach us.
They don't look friendly,
and I'm on the lam.
So are we. Violet, maybe
leaving isn't such a bad idea.
If we leave, we'll miss the
chance to put Count Olaf in jail.
We can't live on
the run forever.
It's not hard. You just have
to evade the authorities,
fake your death in an
unreliable newspaper,
and spend the rest of your days
hiding out in a series of anonymous,
interchangeable motels.
Sounds like a lonely life.
It is, but you'd be safe.
I promise.
Baudelaires? Baudelaires,
is everything all right?
I heard there was some
trouble with a harpoon gun
and one of the managers?
It was an accident.
It was Count Olaf.
Well, you won't have to
worry about him for long.
Come with me. You'll be safe.
I promise.
We should say goodbye to
the man with the taxi.
I guess he couldn't stay.
Come, come.
There you are, Baudelaires!
After you shot that manager, I
went inside and found the manager.
Wait, that can't be right.
Trust me. It can.
Those are the children
I saw from my window!
I recognize them
from the newspaper!
They murdered a man named
Count Olaf in a village!
I recognize them
from my village,
where they murdered Count Olaf!
Now, let's not rush to
judgment, everyone!
Something terrible has happened here,
but we don't have all the facts.
Now go back to your rooms.
Count Olaf's trial will
begin tomorrow morning.
I thought Count Olaf was dead.
You can't believe anything you
read in The Daily Punctilio.
I don't know who
writes that hogwash!
Your wife?
You said the trial would be on Thursday.
That's two days away.
You can't start tomorrow. What
about the other volunteers?
If they were noble volunteers,
they would have arrived early.
What about Kit Snicket?
I'm sorry, children. I would
like to wait for her, too,
but unfortunately, things are
much worse than they seem.
The trial will take place
right here in this lobby.
Aren't trials typically
held in a courthouse?
Usually,
but it's much easier to get people
to come to a fivestar hotel.
Excuse me, Your Honor. I caught
Count Olaf lurking in the hedges.
Thank you, Frank.
Nice try, but this isn't
Frank, it's Ernest!
Actually, I am Frank.
Curses!
Olaf?
Well, if it isn't
the nosy neighbor.
I hope you've been
picking up my mail.
You won't be receiving
mail for a very long time,
unless you change your
mailing address to prison.
Why would I change my address to prison?
Because you'll be a prisoner!
Lock him up until the trial!
Oh, yes, lock me up!
We can't have treacherous
people running around a hotel.
There might be decent,
noble people here!
There are decent,
noble people here.
V.F.D. is here, and they'll make
sure you pay for your crimes.
I see your new friends have
been keeping you in the dark.
What does that mean?
You think V.F.D. is noble?
Think again.
I bet your self-righteous volunteers
never told you what's in the sugar bowl,
why it's important,
or how it was stolen,
but I could.
Oh, the secrets I could share...
about V.F.D., about
your parents.
You think you know this story, but
you don't even know how it begins.
We'll find out the truth.
Not if I'm in prison.
I'm your last chance to
learn what really happened.
I can tell you things that
you'll never learn on your own.
We'd rather see you in jail.
Your choice.
Let's go, buddy.
- Frank, we're sorry about your brother.
- I don't see what the big deal is.
There's still two of you. Ow!
One last thing...
Justice Strauss, are you sure the
High Court can handle Count Olaf?
I don't blame you for
having doubts, Baudelaires.
Count Olaf fooled me once, and
I will never forgive myself,
but there are two other
judges on the High Court,
and I've known them for years,
and they've always been very concerned
whenever I've reported on your case.
I hope you can forgive me,
Baudelaires, and trust me.
But if not,
you can trust the law.
She locked the door.
Maybe we deserve
to be locked up.
Dewey was a good person, and
he's dead because of us.
He's dead because of Count Olaf,
and tomorrow, we can help put
him behind bars for good.
Count Olaf has fooled
people before.
How do we know he's not
gonna fool the High Court?
We'll prepare for any
tricks he might pull.
Have you read anything about trials?
Not much.
This is Room 342.
In a library, 342 is the Dewey
Decimal Number for "criminal law."
Therefore...
Criminal Law.
It's almost morning, and
there are lots of laws.
- You'll have to read quickly.
- Mother said laws are like sausages.
If you learn how they're made,
it can ruin your breakfast.
Sunny, how do you make sausages?
Shove the meat in. Don't worry about the
bones. That's what the grinder is for.
I thought we were gonna get a
sugar bowl and have a tea party,
but we're squishing together
different parts of animals.
Patience, darling.
Mother used to say revenge
is like making sausages.
If you do it right, you can
ruin someone's breakfast.
Our lives, like our
complexions, were perfect
until Count Olaf and the
Baudelaires came along.
No one breaks up with Esmé
Squalor and gets away with it!
So what are we gonna do?
Let them eat crow.
It feels wrong to go to
court wearing disguises.
It's a note from
Justice Strauss.
"I hope these fit. I
know you've grown."
We haven't just grown.
We've changed.
Baudelaires, why haven't you changed?
The trial is starting.
Justice Strauss has
sent me to escort you
and to give you these blindfolds.
Blindfolds?
Everyone wears blindfolds to
enter a High Court trial.
Haven't you heard the
expression, "justice is blind?"
Yes, but that just means that justice
should be fair and unprejudiced.
Well, the High Court ruled that we should
interpret that expression literally,
so everyone must cover their
eyes before the trial starts.
What my sister means is the literal
interpretation makes no sense.
Well, the interpretation
of laws can be perplexing,
like the interpretation
of sausages.
I'll wait in the hall.
Fourth floor, food supply.
Make it snappy.
Hello, Esmé. Have we met?
You sound familiar.
It's me, Jerome.
Your husband?
Oh, that Jerome!
I'd completely forgotten your name.
And your face.
- Hm!
- Are you here for the trial?
I'm here in the name of justice, which
is something you'll never understand.
Darling, justice is out.
Injustice is in.
That's why it's called injustice.
Then why on earth are you here?
We're gonna make those
cakesniffers pay.
My daughter. Isn't she adorable?
Ah!
Lovely catching up.
Ugh!
What a stupid elevator.
Put this on.
Ow!
Ouch!
Let's see...
Where am I?
I can't see!
Oh, that's good. Good.
Uh, we're ready.
Excellent! I'm wearing
a blindfold, too,
so you'll just have to feel around
with your hand to find... Oh! find me.
Come on.
This is like the blind leading the blind,
an expression that I just made up myself.
It's already an expression.
It means the people in charge don't know
any more than the people following.
That hardly seems relevant.
This way to the elevator!
Oh, sorry. Ma'am, excuse me.
I have to tell you, children...
sorry...
I had my doubts about Count Olaf from
the moment I placed you in his care,
and today, the world will
finally see the truth!
It's hard to see anything
with these blindfolds on.
Oh, what a lovely
sculpture of a snake.
This must be the
elevator over this way.
That hurt.
Attention, everyone!
The trial is about to begin.
If you are still standing,
please take your seats.
How can we find our seats?
We can't see them.
Oh... Um, move to your left.
Oh, no. Sorry, my left.
A little more. Little more.
Ow!
Ooh, not that far.
She was terrifying!
Those beady little eyes.
That bloodthirsty smile.
Yes, I've also been trapped in
an elevator with Esmé Squalor.
Esmé? I was talking about
that awful little girl!
Wrong seat, cakesniffer!
It's her! lt's her! lt's her!
Remember, if anyone peeks,
they will be held in
contempt of court.
Is everyone seated?
- There's Klaus.
- Good.
You may remove your blindfolds.
But we just put them on.
Don't be silly, Klaus.
Justice may be blind,
but the High Court ruled the evidence
must be seen to be believed.
You will put the blindfolds
back on for the verdict.
That doesn't make any sense.
Baudelaires, I see you found
the clothes I left for you.
They fit perfectly, thank you.
I can't wait to see Count
Olaf pay for his crimes.
He infiltrated my school and didn't attend
a single one of my violin recitals!
He's a very bad man who
owes me a lot of candy.
Not like that nice gym
teacher, Coach Genghis.
I attended Prufrock Preparatory School.
Give my regards to the principal.
"Give my regards
to the principal."
Everybody knows that the vice
principal is more important!
Besides, that guy
disappeared ages ago.
No one's seen him in years.
I hope they cut off
Count Olaf's head!
All rise for the
High Court judges,
myself and my
esteemed colleagues.
Why are they so high up?
The High Court ruled to
interpret their name literally.
Hm.
You may sit.
Bring in Count Olaf!
Please hold the applause!
No, don't clap for him!
This is a courtroom,
not a theater!
I thought this was a hotel.
It's a hotel acting in
the role of a courtroom.
Thanks to the efforts of many
concerned parties and a banker,
I have compiled a comprehensive
file on the Baudelaire case.
I submit to the Court...
The Complete History
of Injustice
or Odious Lusting
After Fortunes.
I titled it myself.
Sadly, I must also
submit this harpoon gun,
which was used to kill a hotel
manager late last night,
but we'll discuss that later.
The judges will now
hear this case,
while the authorities
wait outside
to apprehend any guilty
party who tries to escape.
Speaking of parties,
after the trial,
everyone is welcome to the
after-party, hosted by me.
Wealthy women are
particularly welcome.
I'm also having a party.
It's a cocktail party, and
fashionable men get a free gift.
My party will have
Broadway-caliber musical numbers.
My party will have an adorable
girl doing a tap routine.
My party will have fireworks!
My party will have sausages!
Order in the court!
We are discussing social
justice, not social engagements.
You should reconsider. I don't imagine
you get invited to a lot of parties.
That is enough!
I call our first witnesses.
That's you, Baudelaires.
Please state your names.
We know them, of course. It's
just standard procedure.
Violet Baudelaire.
Klaus Baudelaire.
Occupation?
Inventor. Researcher.
I object! Their proper
occupation is orphan,
or inheritor of a large fortune.
Your objection is noted, though I caution
the defendant about speaking out of turn.
Is this out of turn? Yes!
Baudelaires, you have
traveled a great distance
and suffered a great deal,
but you're finally safe,
among friends and associates,
classmates and co-workers,
faculty members...
and countless neighbors,
reporters,
theatergoers,
fashionistas,
doctors, nurses,
carnival guests,
mountain climbers,
telegraph operators,
and deep-sea divers.
They have been watching
you all along the way
and are prepared to speak
out on your behalf,
but the most important
testimony is yours.
Go on, Baudelaires. Tell
us your story.
This time, we promise to listen.
It began when our parents told us to
take a rickety trolley to Briny Beach.
It was a gray and cloudy day, so
we had the beach to ourselves.
We were testing an invention
when we saw a figure in the mist.
It was Mr. Poe from the bank.
He told us...
He told us our parents had
perished in a terrible fire.
Hm.
We went to live with Count Olaf.
He hit Klaus across the face!
He tried to marry Violet!
He poisoned Uncle Monty!
He threw Aunt Josephine
to the leeches!
- He conspired with Esmé Squalor.
- And Carmelita Spats.
He kidnapped the Quagmire
triplets from Prufrock Prep.
He murdered Jacques Snicket in
the Village of Fowl Devotees.
He tried to cut off Violet's
head at the Heimlich Hospital.
He... He threw...
He threw a brave and noble
librarian to the lions.
Everywhere we went,
we tried to tell people who he
was and what he was capable of!
But they wouldn't listen!
Nobody would listen!
How simply dreadful!
We lost everything.
Except each other.
We survived because we believed that
one day we'd find a safe place.
Where people would listen to us.
And believe us.
We've suffered so much, but the
root of our suffering is one man.
That man...
Count Olaf.
This world won't be quiet or
safe until he's behind bars.
And all decent people
have their day in court.
Thank you.
They're so brave!
They're so organized!
They remind me of myself!
If only you children had told
me what you were going through.
Thank you, Baudelaires.
We are grateful
for your courage.
You may step down now.
I had planned to call
other witnesses,
but your testimony was so compelling,
I hate to waste another second.
I'm going to consult
with my fellow judges,
and if they agree,
we can declare these unfortunate
events over at last.
That's a relief.
That book on criminal law said that
trials can last days or even years.
That's what I'm worried about.
Look at Olaf.
He's about to go to jail.
Why does he look calm?
Maybe he's acting calm.
We both know he's not that good.
Something's wrong.
It seems my fellow judges
are ready to deliberate.
So without further ado...
A violin solo about
a naval disaster!
No! No, please stop that!
We will now retire to
decide the verdict.
Rest assured, Baudelaires,
your word is all the
evidence we need.
Your Honor, wait! Klaus,
do you have an objection?
Klaus, what are you doing?
Justice Strauss says our word is
enough to convince the judges,
but it's never been enough
to convince anyone before,
and Count Olaf knows that.
They need to hear
from someone else.
One who knows the wicked
things Count Olaf has done,
who wouldn't pass up the chance
to speak in front of a crowd.
Baudelaires, is there a problem?
Not at all, Your Honor. We'd like
to call a witness of our own.
A witness calling a witness?
That's highly unusual.
According to a book on criminal law, a
witness may question another witness
if they're acting
in loco advocatus.
In the role of an attorney.
I see you've kept up
your legal studies,
but wouldn't you rather see this
story over, once and for all?
We would. That's why
we have to do this.
The floor is yours, Baudelaires.
Thank you, Your Honor.
We call Count Olaf to the stand!
You may applaud.
Will the defendant
state his name.
Count Olaf.
Occupation?
Impresario.
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?
I have never told a lie in my life.
That's a lie!
You can't prove that. That's
the whole point of this trial.
Ah, but I've always been honest
about my desires, orphans:
you, maimed or dead, and your
fortune in my rarelywashed hands.
That's more than the rest
of these people can say.
These people are
here to help us.
Help you?
Look around!
I see a banker who cares more about
a promotion than three orphans.
Vice President of
Orphan Affairs.
I see a man who was too
afraid to protect you,
and a woman who values
paperwork over people's lives.
I see a vice principal who was more
than happy to let me into his school,
as long as I stroked his ego.
That's a lie! He
only stroked my...
violin.
I see rich people who only cared
about you because you were "in,"
and villagers who only took
you in to do their chores.
I see volunteers whose complicated codes
and pretentious literary references
are useless against the real
treacheries of the world.
And presiding over them all,
a justice so blind
she let me marry you!
These so-called decent people
have done more to help my schemes
than any of my associates.
They should be up
here right now.
They're not. You are.
Yes...
but you're up here
too, Baudelaires.
Tell me...
on Mount Fraught, what despicable act
did you perform to rescue your sister?
We held Esmé...
Louder, please, for the Court.
We held Esmé Squalor hostage...
And when you needed to reach V.F.D.
headquarters in the Mortmain Mountains,
what did you help me do?
Burn down Caligari
Carnival, but...
Let's hear from some witnesses.
You!
Who caused all the terrible accidents
at Lucky Smells Lumbermill?
Klaus Baudelaire, but...
You! Who stole Hal's keys and broke
into the library at Heimlich Hospital?
Violet Baudelaire, but...
You in the crow hat!
After the Baudelaires were accused of
murder in the Village of Fowl Devotees,
did they accept
their punishment?
That baby busted
them out of jail!
You were going to
burn us at the stake!
Well.... And I don't
need to ask you
who shot Dewey Denouement,
for I was there.
It was Violet, Klaus,
and Sunny Baudelaire,
by the pond, with
the harpoon gun!
Baudelaires, is this true?
Let me remind you,
you're under oath.
It's not the whole truth.
- You're manipulating the facts!
- So are you.
You're not the innocent orphans you've
let these people think you are.
You've lied.
You've stolen.
You've abandoned people.
You've set fires.
Time after time,
you have relied on treachery for
survival, just like everybody else.
Because here is the real truth
that no one is willing tell you...
There are no noble
people in the world.
Our parents.
Ha...
I see your parents never told you
about that night at the opera,
and that box of poison darts.
Your Honor,
I call Esmé Squalor
to the stand.
Name.
Esmé Gigi Geniveve Squalor.
Occupation? Single.
Legally, we're still married!
Single and loving it.
Argh!
Fabulously rich.
Insanely attractive.
The city's fourth most important
financial adviser, or something.
Sixth most important
financial adviser.
Sixth.
You're trying my patience.
Try the sausages.
Aren't you adorable!
They're definitely not poisoned.
No further questions.
You may cross-examine
the witness.
Well?
Don't you have any
burning questions?
Any unsolved mysteries gnawing
away in those smarty-pants brains?
Go ahead.
It'll be fun.
Ms. Squalor, ever since we met you, you've
been obsessed with a stolen sugar bowl.
We want to know why.
I thought you'd never ask.
We were at the opera,
and Beatrice was talking about
morality, or something.
It's wrong. Something so valuable
shouldn't be in the hands of one person.
Please, darling, you can
trust me to keep it safe.
I'm rich and beautiful.
Listen to me, Esmé.
There are traitors within V.F.D. who
do not want to put out fires at all.
A certain man with a beard but no hair,
a certain woman with hair but no beard.
They think fire can solve
any problem in the world.
What if they get their hands on
Gregor Anwhistle's research?
Or what if they
recruit any volunteer
who feels lost and vulnerable
enough to join them?
We could be looking at a schism.
You want a family one day.
I do, too.
Don't you want to raise your
children in a safer world?
This sugar bowl is our only hope.
It can save lives.
It completes my tea set.
There's only one option left.
It's a wicked thing to do.
For a noble reason.
What choice do we have?
Here, Esmé.
You don't want to miss
the penultimate scene.
"Penultimate" is a word
meaning "next to last."
Who sings in the
middle of a duel?
It is an opera.
Well, I prefer my entertainment
without unmotivated musical numbers,
but someday I may
change that opinion.
This tea needs more sugar.
Thieves!
Was that a poison dart?
It's the season's
"innest" weapon.
One of my admirers smuggled
it to me at intermission.
So did one of mine.
You'll never throw it.
Your great gift, aside from your ability
to pull off dragonfly-themed couture,
is your compassion.
What is going on?
Are we throwing darts? That's
more exciting than opera!
We're all friends here. Let's have
a quiet, rational discussion.
Friends don't steal sugar bowls.
Everyone remain calm!
Oh!
Olaf...
You!
Enough!
This trial is about
the Baudelaires,
not some mysterious event
that happened in the past.
Don't you want to know
what happened next?
What happened next?
It was a slippery slope.
The theft led to a murder,
which led to a schism,
which led to two retracted
marriage proposals
and a series of arsons.
Friends became enemies,
children became orphans,
and all because of...
He should get that looked at.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Must be something I ate.
Well, it can't be
these sausages.
That adorable little girl
swore they weren't poisoned.
Carmelita. The
Medusoid Mycelium.
Yes!
Gasp for air and
wail with anguish!
A tingly sensation
in your throats?
That's the taste of my
tingly, sensational revenge
which, like justice and
sausages, has been served cold!
Everyone, Esmé Squalor poisoned
you with a deadly fungus
called the Medusoid Mycelium!
Even a single spore is deadly!
Horseradish is the only cure!
How did you find the Mycelium?
I hid that diving helmet where
it could never be found.
I didn't find the Mycelium.
Then why is everybody coughing?
It's probably the pepper.
You mean to tell me
that you had the opportunity to
poison this entire courtroom,
and you served them
overly peppered sausages?
Not just any sausages!
The meat was dark and tough
because it came from the
darkest and toughest of birds!
You people humiliated me,
so I made you eat crow!
- We've been eating crow?!
It tastes more like chicken.
Yes!
Argh!
Drink some water, everyone.
The Court will deal with you later.
Sit down.
Baudelaires, please take a seat.
You, take a seat!
Now, there'll be no more interruptions,
distractions, or side plots.
Count Olaf, is there anything further
you'd like to say to the Court?
Not in the form of a song.
I'm innocent. Very well.
I'm so incredibly innocent
that the word "innocent"
should be written on my face.
The "i" would stand
for "I'm innocent."
The "n" would stand for "nothing
wrong," which is what I've done.
The "a" would stand for...
- That's not how you spell innocent.
- I'm sure spelling doesn't count.
Spelling counts.
Well, then innocent should
be spelled O-L-A-F,
because that is how I plead.
I'm...
I'm sorry, Baudelaires, but...
my fellow judges want
to know how you plead.
But we're not the ones on trial.
This trial is for Count Olaf.
I don't like it any
more than you do,
but in light of recent evidence,
I don't have a choice.
How do you plead, Baudelaires?
We're innocent.
Are you sure you can say that,
after everything we've heard?
We're innocent.
Enough.
The judges will now convene
to reach a verdict.
Baudelaires, please
take your seats.
Everyone, put your
blindfolds back on.
You, too, Baudelaires.
I don't want to put
a blindfold on.
We have to put our blindfolds on
if we want to see justice served.
If we put blindfolds on, we
won't see anything at all.
You don't have to put your blindfold on.
I'll do it for you.
Please don't.
Stop. I have my
No! Justice Strauss?
Justice Strauss cannot
reply right now.
She's concentrating very
deeply on this case.
Justice Strauss is fine.
She made that noise because she's enjoying
a delicious piece of saltwater taffy.
Those voices sound familiar.
We have to look.
- We'll be in contempt of court.
- Maybe this court deserves contempt.
The Baudelaires have taken
off their blindfolds!
They're guilty of
contempt of court.
We certainly are! This court
is worthless and dishonorable!
Two of those judges are
working with Count Olaf!
That's absurd. Justice
Strauss can tell you
we've served on the High
Court for many years.
Although she can't tell you that now
because she's just taken a vow of silence.
Justice Strauss,
those judges are...
Everyone, take off your blindfolds! Count
Olaf has kidnapped Justice Strauss!
Those brats are liars!
That's the truth!
I believe them! They've
experienced villainy before!
I don't! They're
nothing but trouble!
They're telling the truth!
Unless they're lying!
They're murderers!
They're cakesniffers!
They're brave,
like their mother!
They're orphans,
like their father!
They're guilty!
They're innocent!
They're hypnotized!
They're real big fans
of Herman Melville!
Anyone taking off
their blindfold
will be arrested by
the authorities.
- You can't trust the authorities.
- They're escaping!
The Baudelaires are running to
the elevator! Capture them!
Going down?
We're going wherever
you're going.
I'm going to the laundry room.
I have to retrieve
the sugar bowl,
then I'm going up to the roof to
retrieve the Medusoid Mycelium,
then I'm going down to the
lobby to poison everyone,
then I'm going back up to the
roof to escape the authorities.
It's a lot of ups and
downs, but hey, so is life.
You can't retrieve the sugar
bowl without the code.
Sure you can. This hotel
is like a library,
and you can find anything in a
library if you have one thing.
A catalog? A hostage.
I found these clues to the code
on that waiter that I boiled,
and I'm sure the answers are
in that black book of yours.
Tell me, or eat harpoon! Never!
Baudelaires, help me
overpower this villain
and bring him to the lobby
so justice can be served!
The other judges are his associates.
They'll never put him in jail.
But I've known them for years!
They've always been very interested
whenever I've mentioned you children.
Of course they are, you fool!
They're on my side of the schism!
That trial was rigged
from the start.
I failed you again, Baudelaires.
You will fail me if you don't
help me open the lock.
The first clue is the medical condition
all three Baudelaires share.
Well?
We're allergic to peppermints.
Klaus, what are you doing?
Every noble person has failed us. Why
should we protect the sugar bowl?
All right! Get out of my way! I know
the answer to the next question.
Those letters don't
spell anything.
Spelling doesn't count.
Yes, it does!
Tell me the phrase and
I'll type it in. Fine.
The second phrase is the
weapon that left me an orphan.
From that night at the opera.
Poison dart.
Yes.
Type it in!
The sugar bowl is so
close I can taste it!
The third clue is the famous
unfathomable question
in the best-known novel
by Richard Wright.
That's an interesting question.
No one cares!
Type it in!
Klaus, why are you doing this?
Because...
The sugar bowl isn't
in the laundry room.
Of course it's here.
I saw that crow get shot and the
sugar bowl fall into the vent.
That vent doesn't lead
to the laundry room.
Dewey was right. The
lock is a decoy.
Then where is it?
That secret died with
Dewey Denouement.
Then I guess he's not the only
volunteer who will die today.
If I can't get what I
want, then nobody will.
I'll unleash the Medusoid Mycelium and
destroy every soul in this hotel!
Those volunteers never thought I
was noble enough. I'll show them!
Those judges never thought I was
wicked enough. I'll show them, too!
I will get my revenge
on everyone,
and volunteers and villains
alike will perish in anguish!
You'll die with them. Oh, no.
I'll just push the Carmelita
II off the roof and sail away.
You can't sail a boat off
a tenstory building.
The force of gravity would
smash it to pieces!
Well, then, I suppose I'll add
gravity to my list of enemies.
I'll get the boat off the roof.
Violet, no!
What are you doing?
Nobody's safe as long as Count Olaf's here.
We have to get him far away.
Let's go!
It's time to poison this hotel.
What did the little brat say?
She said, "Burn down
hotel." Sunny, no!
The littlest orphan is
following in my footsteps!
I was a good guardian after all!
You were a terrible guardian! Sunny
doesn't know what she's saying.
I was so busy planning revenge I
forgot to take time for my hobbies.
I'll just pour those flammable
chemicals onto those sheets.
What are you doing? Innocent
people will get hurt.
Sunny's right. If we warn people about
the fungus, they might not listen.
They never listen, but
if there's a fire...
- They might evacuate the building.
- And be safe.
You'll never get away with this!
I have all the evidence of
your treachery right here!
Thanks for the kindling.
Time to unleash a deadly fungus.
I hope you know what
you're doing, Baudelaires.
What are you doing, Baudelaires?
If we stop on every floor, I'll never reach
the roof in time to poison everyone!
That's brilliant! If we stop on
every floor, we can warn everyone!
And save all these people.
Only the ones who
will believe you.
The hotel is on fire!
A fire? Olaf, you're
finally thinking big.
There's no fire. The Baudelaires are
trying to trick you!
Whatever you do,
stay where you are!
We're not lying! Can't
you smell the smoke?
That's from the barbecue
for the cocktail party!
Typical Olaf. Throwing a party
instead of starting a fire.
And after we tried so hard
to set a bad example.
You have disappointed
us for the last time.
I certainly have.
You're a disgrace to
the legal profession!
Fire! Fire!
Argh!
Klaus? You shouldn't add false
reporting to your list of crimes.
Next, they'll be saying
Count Olaf is here!
Count Olaf is here!
There really is a fire!
You have to leave!
Follow me. I'm such a genius,
I'll find the exit blindfolded.
It's like the blind
leading the blind.
I've got you, sir.
Fire! Fire? Oh, no! No, no, no!
I think the stairs are this way!
I think the stairs are that way!
I don't like to argue. Let's
compromise and just stand here.
Esmé, Carmelita, the hotel is on fire.
You have to get out!
Why should we listen
to cakesniffers?
She's right. You orphans are as
dishonest as my ex-boyfriend.
No, seriously, it's a big fire.
I swear.
Also, the sugar bowl is definitely
not down in the laundry room.
He's lying. We'll take the stairs to the
laundry room and grab it ourselves!
At last, the sugar bowl is mine!
Well, this wasn't my intention, but
at least we got to start a fire.
The fire isn't burning quickly.
People will escape.
It isn't burning slowly either.
What if some people don't?
I'll save the Medusoid
Mycelium for a rainy day.
If we didn't do something, Olaf
would have poisoned everyone.
What choice did we have?
The fire is weakening the structural
integrity of the building. We have to go.
Klaus, help me pull this down.
Attach it to the oarlocks
with the Devil's Tongue knot
and make a drag chute.
Baudelaires,
I know it seems like running from the
law is the answer, but it won't help.
Why, when I was your
age, I spent years
- as a horse thief before...
- We're running out of time!
Klaus, Sunny, help
me tie this off.
I'll stand here and supervise.
Push the boat to the edge of
the roof, or we'll all die.
Fine.
Justice Strauss, come with us.
No, it isn't right!
You can't run from the
scene of a crime.
Come with me, and we'll explain
everything to the authorities.
They might not believe us.
Or they might be enemies.
Look at the High Court.
That's no excuse
for running away!
Justice Strauss, the law isn't always just.
It isn't always good.
That may be so,
but I can still give you a home.
I can keep you safe.
I've been following you for so long, and
you've always been out of my grasp,
but I have you now,
and I won't let you go.
We're sorry.
I'm the captain!
And I say shiver me timbers!
Oh!
It's a terrible fire.
At least if any
volunteers see it,
they'll know that the Last
Safe Place isn't safe anymore.
Oh, they'll know more than that.
They'll know that I've won,
that treachery has triumphed,
and that the Baudelaire orphans
are in my clutches at last.
Since devoting my life to the
case of the Baudelaires,
there are many mysteries
I have yet to solve.
I have yet to learn the final
resting place of the sugar bowl,
though I have a theory involving
a secret sub-basement
and a mail chute disguised
as a laundry vent.
I have yet to learn
why my sister
did not return to the Hotel
Denouement, as promised.
Though I fear the worst.
However, I have learned the answer
to the famous unfathomable question
in the best-known novel by
Richard Wright which asks,
"Who knows when
some slight shock,
disturbing the delicate balance between
social order and thirsty aspiration,
shall send the skyscrapers
in our cities toppling?"
What this means is
that a small event,
like a man failing to give three
children a ride in his taxi,
could ripple and tremble,
and bring down a building.
Have you seen Violet, Klaus,
and Sunny Baudelaire?
They're gone.
I've traveled everywhere
they've been,
I've investigated everything
they've been through,
and now it's all
gone up in flames.
The only thing left of The
Complete History of Injustice...
is this photograph.
Those poor children.
If only someone could
have protected them.
Would you mind if I kept this?
It's too painful to hold on to,
although I can't imagine
you'd have any use for it.
This is not the story
of Lemony Snicket.
But if it were, I would tell
you about a man, a woman,
and a terrible crime that
happened one night at the opera.
I have to tell them the truth.
I threw the dart, not you.
It's my fault. It was my
idea to steal the sugar bowl.
I won't let you trade your life for mine.
Your life is worth more.
Beatrice...
I will love you if I
never see you again,
and I will love you if I
see you every Tuesday.
I will love you as the
iceberg loves the ship,
and as the passengers
love the lifeboat,
and as the battlefield
loves young men,
and as peppermints
love your allergies.
I will love you as we grow older, which
just happened and happened again,
and will continue to happen.
I will love you until every fire has been
extinguished and every home rebuilt,
and every code and
heart has been broken.
I will love you if you
marry someone else,
and I will love you
if have a child,
or two children, or three.
Seems like a good number.
I love you, Beatrice.
I always will.
You've always had
a way with words.
He's over there!
Please stay.
That's not how this story goes.
The story of Lemony Snicket
would be a sad account
of the brave men and women who
formed a secret organization
with noble intentions,
only to find it
wrecked by a schism,
a series of fires, and
their own tragic mistakes.
Beatrice will pay for this.
Oh, no.
She'll burn.
The story of Lemony Snicket
would be long and lonely
and incomplete.
But this is not that story.
This is the story of the
Baudelaire orphans...
and I am merely the
person telling it.
My name is Lemony Snicket,
and it is my solemn duty to investigate
the lives of the Baudelaire orphans...
because if I do...
I may be able to
find them again.
It's now been many years,
months, and sleepless nights
since I began to investigate
the Baudelaire orphans,
but despite all my research,
I have been unable to
determine their whereabouts.
I cannot find them.
I cannot help them.
I can only hope that
they're alive and safe...
wherever they are now.
