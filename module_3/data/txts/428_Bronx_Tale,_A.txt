- Louie!
- My grandmother's sick.
I'll talk to you later.
I got to go do something.
Where's my fucking money?
- You're dead, you piece of shit!
- C, come here!
- Get over here.
- He's fucking crazy, this kid.
The kid wants his fucking money.
What can you do?
- I got to talk to him.
- You gotta stop babying him.
He owes me money.
- Hit him with a fucking bat.
- Knock him all over the block.
Is that the advice you give
the kid, you fucking hoodlums?
Come on. Don't listen
to these hoodlums.
I'm going to Gino's.
I'll be back.
What's the matter?
This Louie Dumps
owes me 20 dollars.
It's been two weeks, and whenever
he sees me he keeps dodging me.
He's becoming a pain in the ass.
Should I crack him one?
What's the matter?
What have I been telling you?
Sometimes hurting somebody
ain't the answer.
- Is he a good friend of yours?
- No, I don't even like him.
There's your answer right there.
It costs you 20 dollars
to get rid of him.
He's never bother you again. He's never
gonna ask you for money again.
He's out of your life for
20 dollars. You got off cheap.
You're always right.
If I was, I wouldn't have
done 10 years in the joint.
What did you do every day?
There's only three things
to do in the joint, kid:
lift weights, play cards
or get into trouble.
- What did you do?
- Me? I read.
What did you read?
- Ever hear of Machiavelli?
- Who?
He's a famous writer
from 500 years ago.
Availability.
That's what he always said.
- Availability?
- That's right. Listen to me.
You know why I live
in this neighborhood?
Availability.
I want to stay close
to everything...
because being on the spot,
I can see trouble immediately.
Trouble is like a cancer.
You got to get it early.
Otherwise it gets big
and kills you.
You got to cut it out.
You're worried about
Louie Dumps.
Nobody cares.
Worry about yourself, your family,
the people that are important to you.
That's what it comes down to:
availability.
The people that see me every day
that are on my side...
they feel safe
because they know I'm close.
That gives them
more reason to love me.
The people that want to do otherwise,
they think twice...
because they know I'm close.
That gives them
more reason to fear me.
Is it better
to be loved or feared?
That's a good question.
It's nice to be both,
but it's difficult.
But if I had my choice...
I would rather be feared.
Fear lasts longer than love.
Friendships bought with money
mean nothing.
You see how it is.
I make a joke, everybody laughs.
I'm funny, but not that funny.
Fear keeps them loyal to me.
The trick is not being hated.
I treat my men good. But if I
give too much, I'm not needed.
I give just enough where they need me
but don't hate me.
Don't forget what I'm telling you.
Sonny, I got some
beautiful veal chops today.
I got some nice linguine...
and I got
some beautiful sauce.

You're not dressed properly.
You'll have to leave.
What's wrong
with how we're dressed?
These gentlemen ain't dressed
right. I asked them to leave.
Is there a problem?
He's acting like our money ain't
green. We just want some beers.
A few beers, that's it?
That's it. We'll be on our way.
We ain't looking for trouble.
Spoken like a gentleman.
Give them their beers.
- I appreciate that.
- No problem.
Here you go.
You got some brews down here?
Nice cold ones.
Two over here, huh?
One more beer.
Got some thirsty people here.
All right, brothers.
If I may, a toast to our host.
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost!
Get wet, you dago wop!
Look at all this shit
all over me!
Oh, you again, huh?
That wasn't very nice.
Now you got to leave.
I'll tell you when the fuck
we leave. Get away from me.
Hey, watch the bikes, man.
- What's going on here?
- Come on!
- This is half empty.
- What's this shit?
What's going on here?
Now you can't leave.
I will never forget
the look on their faces.
All eight of them.
Their faces dropped.
All their courage and strength
was drained from their bodies.
They had a reputation
for breaking up bars.
But they knew that instant
they made a fatal mistake.
This time, they walked
into the wrong bar.
Come on, motherfucker!
Crack his fucking head open!
You fucking creep!
Step on his head!
Get them out of here!
Drag them the fuck out!
Move it!
Watch my car!
Fucking punks!
Get him!
Grab that hairy bastard!
Let the kids kill them.
- Hit him!
- Get away!
Kick him in his face!
Here, you motherfucker!
Look at me.
I'm the one who did this
to you. Remember me.
Come on, Sonny!
Let's go, you guys!
- They ruined my lunch!
- Let's get out of here!
Leave them there
like the dogs that they are.
They ruined my whole
fucking lunch! Come on!
Take a look at this gun
right here.
It's a.45.
This thing could stop
an elephant driving a truck...
and the truck too.
Nicky Zero
was the neighborhood thief.
His mother called him Zero. She
said he'd never amount to nothing.
It's too big.
Where will you hide it?
- Then you want this one.
- They can spot that.
- You need this.
- What is wrong with you?
Don't point the gun.
It's on safety.
I won't kill you.
Don't ever do that.
Now let me see the fucking gun.
- This is you. This is class.
- I don't know.
- What's this?
- Let me see this.
Feels nice.
Right there. Feel it.
I wanna shoot somebody,
you know what I mean?
I wanna shoot somebody too.
That's the gun for it.
- What are you guys doing?
- You think so?
What's going on?
Are you stupid or something?
Are you fucking stupid
or something?
What's the matter with you,
selling guns around here?
You'll make this whole place hot
and get us all fucking pinched.
Get out of here!
Stay over here. Don't move.
All of you. Stay right there.
I want no guns. You hear me?
Get out of here!
C, get over here!
Come here.
I want to talk to you.
- Sonny, loan me 500.
- Tomorrow.
You think you're a tough guy
with these guns, is that it?
No, but after what happened
in the bar, I thought...
You think a gun
makes you a tough guy?
I seen more guys with guns
wet the bed than anything.
It's when the other guy
pulls out his gun.
Then we see
who the tough guy is.
You don't understand.
I do understand.
This shit is not for you.
Those kids are gonna
get you in trouble.
But they're my friends.
You know that.
They're jerk-offs.
Look at me.
Jerk-offs.
And Slick is
the biggest jerk-off.
What have been telling you?
"Stay in school.
Get two educations." I know.
That's right.
Don't do what I do.
This is my life, not yours.
I do what I have to do.
This is not for you.
All right. I'm sorry.
Want to go to the fights
with me tomorrow?
I don't know.
I got a piece of
a good middleweight.
Come with me.
We'll sit in front.
I would like to come, but I told
my father I would go with him.
You know where I'm sitting.
Come by and say hello.
- All right.
- You know where I'm sitting.
Sit here.
Nice seats.
I hope I don't get a nosebleed.
These are the best I can do.
What do you want?
I'm only kidding.
Hi, C. How are you doing?
Hello, Lorenzo.
How are you doing?
Sonny has a couple of ringside
seats for you. Come on down.
Tell him thanks,
but we're good where we are.
Tell Sonny thanks,
but we're good where we are.
You're welcome to come down.
You know where the seats are.
Anytime during the fight. Okay?
Okay. Thanks.
Introducing the principals
for this evening's main event.
He's got seats for us.
He's trying to be our friend.
I like my seat. I paid for it.
You want to go down there, go.
Go ahead. Go down there.
Welcome
Eric "The Rock Man" Holland!
I bring you,
and you want to go with them.
Go with them.
You think I want to sit with you
when you want to be with them?
From the Bronx, New York...
How do you think
that makes me feel?
Joe Carey!
I'm sorry if I hurt you, Dad.
Everything I've been
telling you.
He's been avoiding me. When I
see him, I'll break his face.
- Do you like him?
- He's a jerk-off!
Ten dollars. You got off cheap.
He's out of your life.
I'm still going to
fucking break his face.
I couldn't believe it.
She was right in front of me.
I never forgot her since I
saw her on my father's bus.
I wanted to talk to her,
but she was with her friends...
and I was with mine.
I only have eyes
For you
Dear
This fucking doo-wop.
I want to strangle one of them.
My love must be a kind
of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
- Let's get something to eat.
- This fat bastard ate it all.
What's wrong with you?
You're always eating.
- I was hungry.
- Did you read about the bikers?
- No.
- I was reading the paper.
You see the way Jimmy
was hitting them?
- What about Danny with that pipe?
- I don't know.
- Let's get out of here.
- You wanna get out of here?
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, C.
- I can't come. I got a test.
- Fuck the test.
I missed it last week.
You sure? All right.
We'll be at The Deuces.
Are the stars out tonight
I don't know
if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes
For you
Dear
We were alone for the first time.
I knew I had to say something to her.
This chance
might never come again.
I wanted to be cool, but I still
didn't even know her name.
I said to myself, "She must
have an exotic name...
like Monique or Danielle."
You go to this school?
I'm Jane.
- Jane? That's your name?
- Yeah. What's wrong with that?
Nothing. It's a great name.
I love that name.
I just moved here.
I seen you on the bus
the other day.
And you are?
I'm Calogero.
Ca-who?
- What kind of name is that?
- It's Italian.
Actually, it's Sicilian.
My family's from Sicily.
Sicily?
You know where Italy is?
It's the boot that comes down.
The island next to it that looks
like it's getting kicked...
is Sicily.
- I like Italians.
- You do?
Are you waiting for someone?
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, you are.
All right.
Well, I better go.
Wait.
I was just waiting
for my brother.
Sometimes we walk home together.
If it's no problem,
I could walk you home.
I live down Webster Avenue.
Is that all right?
That's no problem.
Come on. Let's go.
So you wait for your brother?
- That's great.
- What's so great about it?
What's so great about it?
It's just great.
Where did you get that hat from?
- You don't like this hat?
- It's funny-looking.
Maybe it will look better
another way. Hold this.
You have beautiful eyes.
Thanks. So do you.
That's better.
Do you want to go to the movies?
You want to go
to the movies with me?
Yeah. I told you
I liked Italians.
You want to go right now?
No, of course not now.
How about tomorrow?
6:00. We'll meet in front.
I'll be waiting here
till tomorrow then.
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean I'll
meet you in front tomorrow.
Sorry I'm saying stupid stuff.
I'm so nervous.
You're not saying stupid things.
You're doing okay.
You think so?
Where are you originally from?
- Brooklyn.
- What part?
- East New York.
- Where's that?
It's far. Way out.
I got relatives in Brooklyn.
I never heard of that part.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- I suppose they're Italian too.
- Yeah.
That figures.
- What's your last name?
- Williams.
Very easy. Very simple.
Jane Williams.
That's a pretty easy name to say.
Can't say mine's that easy.
Wait. Let me see.
Calogero Anello?
- Yeah.
- Got it.
My friends call me C.
I like Calogero better.
These books are heavy.
That's why I'm glad
you're carrying them.
Well...
I guess this is it.
- I really had a great time.
- Me too.
- I think you're very nice.
- Thanks. So are you.
Thank you.
Sorry I can't walk you
all the way home.
That's all right.
I only live a block down.
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.
Tomorrow night? 6:00?
You're getting better.
I just wanted to double-check.
Well. Bye.
What is it, white motherfucker?
Come on, Aldo.
That was a late fucking finger.
Was it late, man? Tell me.
What are you talking about?
Go ahead! This fucking kid
keeps winning my money!
I'm going to curse him now.
He won't win anymore.
He's got all my money.
How am I going to play?
He won't win anymore. Watch.
What the fuck, man?
These fucking spooks can't ride
in their own neighborhood?
Just leave them alone.
What is it with you
and these niggers lately?
- They ain't bothering nobody.
- They're bothering me.
Not me.
This is our neighborhood,
you black bastard!
Let's get these niggers!
Get the fuck
out of our neighborhood!
- Let's get out of here!
- Get him!
Black bastard!
C, come here!
Leave me alone!
Grab him, C!
Get this motherfucker!
- Stay down!
- I didn't do anything!
I won't hurt you. Stay down.
I don't want to hurt you.
Get him!
Motherfucker!
What are you doing,
dancing with him? Get off!
Get out of here, crazy bastards.
The cops are coming.
I can see them. Go!
- I can see the lights.
- Get off him!
They called the cops! Come one!
Let's go!
They called the cops!
What are you doing?
- You're going to kill him!
- I don't care.
I want to kill him!
- The cops are coming!
- Fuck that!
They called the fucking cops!
Come on!
Didn't I tell you Slick
was nothing but trouble?
Yeah, but he's my friend.
He's your friend.
I'm your friend, kid.
You're letting yourself
get caught up in this shit.
These kids could hurt you.
Think for yourself.
I'm trying,
but we hate these people.
I don't hate them,
but, you know.
What people?
What's on your mind?
- I met this girl.
- Yeah? So?
I like her and everything,
but she ain't white.
She's from Webster Avenue.
- She's a colored girl.
- Yeah.
You like her?
I do, but I don't want
to hear the guys.
Fuck them. Half of them
are gonna end up dead or in jail.
Nobody cares.
All that matters
is what's good for you...
and how you feel
about each other.
Let me tell you something.
When you're alone,
late at night in bed...
just you and her
under the covers...
that's all that matters.
You got to do what your heart
tells you to do.
I'll tell you something.
You're only allowed three
great women in your lifetime.
They come along like great
fighters, once every ten years.
Rocky Marciano.
Sugar Ray Robinson. Joe Louis.
Sometimes you get them
all at once.
Me? I had my three
when I was 16. That happens.
What are you gonna do?
That's the way it goes, you know?
Tell you right now.
See this girl?
Maybe this girl
puts wind in your sails.
Maybe she's
your first great one.
Thanks, Sonny.
I think I'll go for it.
- Is she a good kid?
- I just met her. I hope so.
Tomorrow you borrow my car.
- You don't lend it to anybody.
- I'll lend it to you.
I want you to make
a good impression.
You borrow my car,
and you give her the test.
The "Mario test"?
Mario's a psycho.
Why do you listen to him?
Give her my test,
the door test.
- What's that?
- Listen to me.
You pull up
right where she is.
Before you get out of the car,
lock both doors.
You get out of the car,
you walk over to her.
You bring her over to the car.
You take out the key, unlock it,
open the door for her.
You let her get in.
Then you close the door for her.
You walk behind the car and
look through the rear window.
If she doesn't reach over and
lift up that button for you...
so you can get in,
dump her.
- Just like that?
- Listen to me, kid.
If she doesn't reach over,
lift up that button for you...
she's a selfish broad and all
you're seeing is the tip of the iceberg.
You dump her fast.
What about the beautiful things
you just told me?
Do what my heart tells me to do.
Find someone to put wind in my
sails. She could be a great one.
Bullshit, kid.
The door test is what counts.
You dump her,
and you dump her fast.
- Dump her?
- Dump her.
- Dad. Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.
I need your opinion. You know
Joey Osso from down the block?
He asked me what I thought
about him dating a colored girl.
- What do you think?
- Joey can't find white girls?
That's not a good answer.
What's the problem?
I get along with everybody
on the bus...
but when it comes to marriage,
we should marry within our own.
- You know I'm not prejudiced.
- Don't tell me that. You are.
What would you say if I wanted
to date a colored girl?
You would never do that.
You never know. This girl
might be one of the great ones.
You're only allowed three
great women in your lifetime.
- Who told you that?
- Joey Osso.
You tell him that sometimes
in the heat of passion...
the little head tells
the big head what to do...
and that the big head
should think twice about it.
All right.
Be careful.
- You okay?
- No.
My brother got beat up
in your neighborhood.
What?
Yesterday, some Italian guys
beat up my brother...
in your neighborhood.
- What's that have to do with me?
- Were you there?
- No, I wasn't there.
- Please don't lie to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
I wasn't there.
We'll see who's Iying.
My brother's in the car.
I told him I was going out with
an Italian, so he came along.
He recognized you
and said you beat him up.
- You did that to his face.
- I didn't touch your brother.
Believe me.
Okay, we'll see.
We'll get this straight
right now.
Yeah, that's him.
- You did this to me.
- I didn't do anything...
- Yes, you did!
- I didn't.
- Are you sure it was him?
- I'm positive!
Don't believe him.
I didn't touch him.
- So you were there?
- But I didn't do anything.
- Believe me.
- You told me you weren't there!
It was the other guys.
I tried to help him.
- How did my eye get like this?
- I tried to help you!
- Bullshit, man!
- You know I didn't do anything.
- Why were you on top of me?
- It was the others!
- It was you!
- I was the only one helping you.
This is how you repay me?
Fuck that! No, fuck you, man!
I didn't do anything!
Fuck you, you fucking nigger!
See what I'm talking about?
Just like the rest of them!
How come you're back so fast?
The keys are in the car.
I got to go.
Wait. Come here. What happened?
It just didn't work out.
I got to go.
- What happened with the girl?
- Everything went wrong.
You want to go to the track?
No. I don't want to talk.
I got to go.
C, you sure?
- Come on.
- Maybe next time, Sonny.
Come on.
Take my car.
Bobby, you drive.
Okay, Sonny.
Why are you driving Sonny's car?
- What are you talking about?
- I saw you driving his car.
- I don't want you driving his car.
- I'm not in the mood to hear this.
I don't care. We already
talked about the bikers...
and that fight in that bar.
- I don't want you in that bar.
- Should I have run away?
- Make them think I got no heart?
- You think those guys care?
What make you think
you're so special?
- You don't know Sonny.
- I know how he thinks.
You fuck up,
he'll hurt you like anybody.
- Sonny trusts me.
- He can't trust anybody.
The sooner you know that the better.
How often do I have to tell you?
People don't respect him.
They fear him.
There's a big difference.
You want to be somebody?
Be somebody who works
and takes cares of his family.
Yeah, look away. Look...
You're my only son. I'm looking
out for your best interests.
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.
- I don't want to hear this.
- You're going to hear it.
I might not have money,
I might not have a Cadillac...
but I don't have to
look over my shoulder.
I don't answer to anybody. My
parents came here with nothing...
And they died with nothing.
Don't you dare disrespect your
grandparents! Do you hear me?
And you're wrong. They tried
to give me a better life.
- I'm trying to-
- What better life?
We don't own a car! We ain't got money!
We ain't got nothing!
Don't take it out on me
because you're a bus driver.
The working man is a sucker!
Hey, C. Look what these black
motherfuckers did to our club.
You believe the balls on them,
throwing eggs at our club?
Get in the car.
We're going to go fuck them up.
Get in the car.
Sonny and Jimmy!
Oh, shit! Back off!
Get out of here!
What's going on?
After you picked up my car,
where did you go?
I drove around and went
to pick up Jane. Why?
Was there really a Jane?
Sonny, what is it?
After you dropped that car off,
it didn't start.
We found something on the
engine. It didn't go off.
Tell me how that got on there,
and where did you go in my car!
I picked it up,
I drove right to the school...
and I locked the doors
like you told me.
Don't lie to me!
Where did you go with my car?
I didn't do anything!
I swear! Please!
- Don't lie to me!
- I didn't do anything!
I swear, I just went right
to the school and that was it!
I swear to God!
Why would I hurt you?
You've been like a father to me!
Calogero? Hey!
- What happened to my son?
- Go drive your bus.
- Don't tell me to drive my bus!
- Take it easy!
Touch me and I'll stick you
in the fucking ground!
Next time find out what's going
on before you open your mouth.
Come here.
- What happened with you and Sonny?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
Where'd you get this car?
Don't worry about it.
We borrowed it.
Slow down!
I don't wanna get pinched
before we get there.
I know. I'm not driver
for nothing.
We're in a hot car. Slow down.
I know what I'm doing.
Don't worry about it.
What's that smell?
We made those niggers
a cocktail.
Look at these beauties.
We're going to teach them
a lesson.
- We're going to finish the job.
- For throwing eggs at our joint.
Ralphie, take this.
Why don't you give me
the big one?
Take that and shut up!
I'll take these motherfuckers!
I hate them! I'll kill them!
What are you doing,
lighting a cigarette?
- Relax.
- You got the cocktails in here.
Relax. I know what I'm doing.
I can't wait to see the look
on those motherfuckers' faces.
I can't wait.
They were smiling. I was too,
but I was dying inside.
I wanted out, but I
couldn't get out of the car.
What was I going to say?
"Let me out. I'm afraid."
You better use that gun.
I could never go back
to that neighborhood.
They would call me a punk,
a dog, a mutt.
They would say I got no heart.
I kept hearing my father's voice
in my head. "Don't blow it, son.
These people will hurt you.
Don't waste your talent."
Then I kept hearing
Sonny's voice.
"Be careful, C. Don't lose it.
Keep your head."
Somebody pulled the chain,
and I was going down the toilet.
They want to throw eggs
at our club?
We'll give them
a big surprise.
C, out of the car.
- He's with us.
- Mind your business. Get out.
Come on. He's with us.
Come on. Move.
For the last time,
stay away from this kid.
I can't believe it.
You don't even trust me?
Listen. It's not
that I don't trust you.
I won't listen. You don't even
believe there was a Jane.
Couldn't it have been in the car
when I picked it up?
Me and Jane could have gotten
killed. You never thought that, did you?
Don't you trust anybody?
It's a horrible way to live.
For me, it's the only way.
Not for me.
Some fine-looking black chick
was just here looking for you.
- She just left?
- If you hurry, you'll catch her.
Come here.
Told you.
You want me to go get him?
No, leave him alone.
My brother told me the truth.
You did try to help him.
I told you.
I know. But he
took it out on you.
It's okay.
I understand how he felt.
I'm glad you understand.
Mind your own business!
Get back in your house!
Let them stare.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
- Glad you came to see me.
- I missed you.
I missed you too.
I think you're beautiful.
Stop.
No, I really do.
I want to be with you,
and I don't care what anybody says.
- Can I have a kiss?
- Sure.
That's not a kiss.
This is a kiss.
Do you know how to make sauce?
What?
You know, sauce for macaroni.
Shut up.
I'm really sorry
about what happened.
- My brother didn't mean it.
- Where's your car?
Give me the keys! We got to go!
- What are you talking about?
- We got to get there.
I knew you were
one of the great ones.
Great ones?
What are you talking about?
Never mind.
It's an Italian thing.
Hurry up.
Make a U-turn over here.
Go by in front.
What are they doing
in our neighborhood?
Get it out!
Be careful, guys.
- What's happening?
- What happened?
- Four white guys just got blown up.
- White guys got killed, that's what.
Willy, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
They started out as white boys.
Now they are toast.
They look better now, right?
They left something for you
in the trunk! Take a look.
Get out of our neighborhood!
Fucking pussy-ass motherfucker!
Don't say shit, man!
Get out of the neighborhood!
Sometimes when I think about it I don't
know if I should've been happy or sad.
Happy because I was alive...
or sad because
my friends were dead.
But one thing I knew was
I was grateful.
Grateful because of Sonny.
Listen, Jane, I got to go.
- You okay?
- Yeah, man.
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- Jive-ass white motherfucker!
You don't understand.
I was in that car.
Just go. The boys
are about to go crazy.
What are you looking at?
Fuck that bitch too!
Go.
Get the fuck out of
the neighborhood!
He saved my life.
I had to tell him.
I wanted to thank Sonny.
He saved my life.
C, I swear,
my grandmother's still sick.
I'll give you the 20 next week.
Forget the 20!
- You know where Sonny is?
- I don't care where he is!
I'm losing here!
Why are you breaking my balls?
He's in the front.
C! Come here!
Let my boy through.
Come here.
All I could see
was big smiling faces.
All of a sudden, out of all
these smiling faces...
there was this one face.
I couldn't understand why I kept
looking at this one face...
and then I realized
he wasn't smiling.
All I could see was this guy...
and nobody could see him but me.
Come on, C!
Come here!
Get an ambulance!
The guy that killed Sonny
was the son of the man he killed...
eight years earlier
in front of my house.
There were flowers
all over the place.
Gangsters have this thing
about flowers.
Whoever sends the biggest arrangement
cares the most.
- John and Anthony from Detroit.
- How are you?
Did you see the way
he went down?
It was just like
Sonny said it would be.
Nobody cares.
I'm sorry,
but we got to close up.
Could you give me
a couple more minutes?
Okay. I'll be in my office.
How are you doing, Sonny?
Not so good, huh?
She passed the test.
That's what I wanted to tell you.
She might be
my first great one.
I'm going to go out with her.
Thanks for helping me.
Thank you for saving my life.
I never got a chance
to tell you.
They all died.
Slick, Aldo, Mario, Ralphie.
All of them.
Sorry. I thought I was alone.
I'm just thinking out loud.
That's okay.
It's understandable.
This man is a great man.
He saved my life.
- You Lorenzo the bus driver's kid?
- Yeah.
- C, right?
- Yeah.
Sonny told me all about you.
Sorry, but I don't
even know who you are.
My name is Carmine.
We go back a long way together,
Sonny and me.
He saved my life too once.
You don't remember me, do you?
Many years ago?
In front of your house?
You don't remember this?
You were the guy who got hit
with the baseball bat, right?
Yeah, I remember.
I was there.
I saw the whole thing.
I know, kid.
Sonny told me what you did.
Listen, I've been away.
But I'll be in the neighborhood
taking care of things for a while.
You need anything, come and
see me at the bar, okay?
I think I'll give the bar a rest
for a while, but thanks anyway.
It's okay. I understand.
Was that fight really over
a parking space?
Don't forget.
You need anything, come see me.
- Anything.
- All right.
So long, kid.
Dad, what are you doing here?
I came to pay my respects
to your friend.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry if I ever hurt you
in any way.
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I want to thank you
for saving my kid's life.
I never hated you.
I guess it's...
that I was mad at you because
you made him grow up so fast.
May God have mercy on your soul.
I'll wait over here.
Did you hear that?
My father didn't hate you.
Nobody cares, huh?
You were wrong about that one.
Wasted talent.
See you around.
Let's go home, C.
Sonny and my father
always said...
that when I get older
I would understand.
Well, I finally did.
I learned something
from these two men.
I learned to give love
and get love unconditionally.
You just have to accept people
for what they are.
And I learned
the greatest gift of all.
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.
And the choices that you make
will shape your life forever.
But you can ask anybody
from my neighborhood...
and they'll just tell you.
This is just another Bronx tale.
