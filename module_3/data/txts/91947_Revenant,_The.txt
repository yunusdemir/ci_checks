Where are we with the haul?
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking, whatever it is
they're hunting out there...
...I hope it don't need
another shot.
Make sure we're ready
to head out by dawn.
Been done
by this morning.
I'd have liked
to be out by how,
but the men
are too tired.
We're only a few days
from the fort.
We're trapped out.
All we have to worry about
is fresh meat for the boys.
Well, you, uh,
seen Coulter?
(JIM PANTING)
JIM: Hey, we took down
an elk. A big one.
We need help
to haul the meat back.
Let me know

I'll help you

FITZGERALD: Captain,
we got a swarm of
tree niggers out here
waiting to finish the job.
Tell me you got
some kind of plan.
Glass?
Missouri's no good.
Not while the Ree's
running it.
We got to
get off this boat.
Oh, you want to
get off the boat?
Then what do we do, huh?
Take our furs
and sit out there
amongst the Ree
like a bunch of ducks?
Only safe thing to do
is track a new course
back up on land.
That'll add weeks
to the trip.
Better than floating
where they can get eyes on us.
They got eyes on you
right now, son.
What I'm saying is
we stay on the boat.
Chart a course
toward the fort
and take our chances
on the water.
Glass knows
this territory best.
It's his job
to get us home safe.
Get us home safe?
Yeah.
FITZGERALD: Need I remind you
we already lost 32 men?
It's 33 now.
They were my men, Fitzgerald.
I know how many I lost.
We do like Glass says.
That's the end of it.
GLASS: We have to
set the boat loose.
If the Ree are tracking us,
they'll find it downriver.
Best course is to
hike inland to the Grand
and follow it
to Fort Kiowa.
ANDERSON: On foot?
It'll be winter
before we get there.
Yeah, unless
we come across a post,
trade for some horses.
Ain't no posts
that far over!
Captain, losing this boat
is a goddamn mistake.
The Ree
ain't that stupid.
We keep it, we can lay it up
around Arrow's Peak.
Quit acting like you know
what you're talking about.
Ain't nobody
talking to you.
Who'd listen
to you anyway?
Can't find your way
out of your breeches
to take a shit.
All I'm saying is
Camp Rhulen
is just up the way.
We can hole up there.
We walk.
Yeah, I'm sure we will.
Wish my dad
was a doctor.
Then he could've bought me
a captain's job.
What do we do, eh?
Pray these pelts ain't rotten
if we ever get back here?
HENRY: Make sure
to mark this place.
We're leaving a fortune
under these rocks.
Glass, chart a course.
Tightest you can that
gets us around the Ree.
FITZGERALD: This ain't right.
We all know these furs
ain't gonna be here
by the time we come back.
There's no way
we can haul them
all the way to the fort.
Arikara are
all through the territory.
We'll want
our hands free.
We're gonna
lose those pelts.
You rather keep the pelts
or your life?
Life?
What life you talking about?
I ain't got no life.
I just got living
and the only way I get that
is through these pelts.
Fuck!
Ain't no way I'm going home
after six months
working my ass off
like a mule...
...risking my neck,
men dying, and for what?
Damn near lost everything.
Job's been fucked
from the start!
There's the one
been fucking us.
You wonder how the Ree
got the dead drop on us...
...when Mr. Glass
was supposed
to look out
for that very thing?
All them
Pawnee buddies of his.
Pawnee's as much against
the Ree as the rest of us.
Yeah?
Well, what about
his little half-breed son?
What kind of savage
you think his mama was?
Oh, lay off the boy, Fitz.
All I'm saying is...
...a savage...is savage.
Hey, Glass...
...is it true
what they say
about you shooting
a lieutenant
while living
with them savages?
Twenty-one dead soldiers
and 40 dead feathernecks.
But you and your boy
the only ones
to walk out alive.
Kind of a miracle.
HENRY: Shut up, Fitzgerald.
FITZGERALD:
Is that what you did?
Shot one of your own
to save this little dog here?
Shut up!
Why? Was he playing with
this little boy's mama, huh?
Did he kill her?
Hey, you can quit
polishing that rifle
when I'm talking to you.
I'm working on it.
You can work on it
when I'm done
talking to you.
Look at me.
HENRY: That's enough!
You're forgetting
your place, boy.
As far as I can tell,
my place is here
on the smart end
of this rifle.
HENRY:
You move along, Fitzgerald.
That's an order!
Listen!
There's only a couple hours
of light left.
We got to stash these pelts
and get rid of the boat.
Let's go!

the right decision?
Leaving the boat?
The Ree own that river.
They would've flanked us.
We stay east of the Grand

we cut a week off our trip.
Lands are bone dry up there.
Nothing for the Ree to hunt.
HENRY: Except us.
GLASS: Except us.
Is it true

Is that why you
came out here to

there is no deal.

They're already branded.
I'll only be able to get half price for them.
Get him away from there.
I said no horses.
We'll take these three horses.
I'm not going to say it again.
They aren't part of the deal.
Now tell your man to step away.

My pop, he weren't
a religious man, you know?
If you couldn't grow it,
kill it, or eat it,
he just plain old
didn't believe in it.
And this one time he head on
up the old Saba hills.
San Saba hills?
He joined a couple Texas
Ranger buddies of his to hunt.
Pretty routine. He done it
like a hundred times before.
Should have been a 3-day kill,
but on the second day,
it all went fucked.
Somehow that night
he lost his buddies.
And to top it off...
...them Comanches
went and took the horses.
So he was starving
and delirious...
...and he crawls up
into this mott, this...
...group of trees out
in the middle of nowhere
just sticking up
in this ocean of scrub...
...and he found religion.
At that moment,
he told me...
...he found God.
Uh-huh.
And it turns out that God...
...He's a squirrel.
Yeah. A big, old meaty one.
"I found God,"
he used to say.
"And while sitting there
and basking in the glory
"and sublimity of mercy..."
shot and ate
that son of a bitch."
Mmm.
Yeah. You might want to

That's what we did.
I'm glad you pulled

when we might be

'Cause them pelts
we collected
are still out there,
you know...
...under a couple foot
of dirt and snow.
But that ain't
my fault.
I'm waiting for
Captain Leavenworth
to arrive
with his army.
Then we'll have
enough men...
...to shoot some civilization
into those fucking Arikara
and get back
our pelts.
All right. All right.
When's that supposed
to happen?
I don't know.
But until then,
nobody gets paid.
Listen here, all right?
I was hired to trap 'em.
I wasn't hired to guard 'em.
The way I see it,
now you, you got a safe.
It's probably
full of money.
You signed a contract
to protect your boss
and your boss's property.
And that safe
isn't full anymore.
It's short about $300.
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?
It means,
according to my records...
...you purchased more goods
on the expedition
than what you are
owed by the company.
Now, Happy New Year,
