Yeah. He said if you guys get hurt,
you'll sue him.
-We won't sue him.
-He said your parents will.
Dude, our parents
can't even afford lawyers.
Hey, man. Let me talk to your dad.
Hey, man. The only Mexicans
my dad talks to push lawn mowers.
Hey, guys. lt's Skip. Come on!
-Hey, shotgun, faggots!
-Hey!
Seriously, we should drain it when
he goes on his next business trip.
Yeah. He'd have you all killed.
Good one, though.
Good idea. But no.
Hey! Kiss me, granny!
Love to get me
some of the gray beaver!
Come back when your balls drop.
Yeah, you're looking good!
-Go back. Go back.
-You, too, Mr. Rogers!
Let's skate already.
Hey, Skip, how you doing?
Hey. They've been swarming my shop
for a week talking about you guys.
What did you expect? Come on.
Next on the demonstration platform...
...the Zephyr Team
from Venice, California.
We love you, Tony Alva!
T.A.!
Right on, Tony!
lt always made sense...
...that skateboarding would be popular
on the West Coast.
This year alone,
l've taken teams to the Midwest....
All right, you got 20 bucks?
One brand-new....
ls that good, man?
Go find your mommy, man.
Come back with 1 0 bucks.
Get out of here.
<i>Jay! Jay! Jay!
Say ''Pepsi.''
Stacy!
You gave me 50 bucks,
you'll get the board...
...because he has the money!
-Stacy!
-Stacy!
We love you, Stacy!
<i>Stacy! Stacy! Stacy!
-Yeah, Stace.
-Yeah, Stacy.
Hey!
Yeah, Tony!
l am Alva!
<i>Let's give a big round of applause
for the Z-Boys from Dogtown!
How groovy was that, huh?
Tony, come talk to me.
See you in the parking lot.
You know, Tony, you might be
the best skater in the world someday.
Fact is, l think you are the best.
What do you want, dude?
Tony, l'll match
whatever Skip's paying you.
And l'll throw in a car.
-What kind of car?
-Hey, Larry.
How about...
...a brand-new Pontiac Firebird,
muscled up with a 455 engine?
l'll believe it when l see it.
Man, l'm the biggest skateboard
manufacturer in the country.
So you know where to find me.
Nice work out there.
Excuse me. Could you get
the front too, please?
Sure thing, bro.
Tell me about Larry, man.
-What about him?
-Well, you tell me.
-Larry said l--
-He told me some shit...
...about how great l was, dude.
''You may be the best skater
in the world someday.
Fact is, l think you are the greatest.''
-Just throw these in.
-Okay, so just two Doritos.
Bye.
-So, what did he say to you, Peralta?
-Yeah.
Well, l guess we're all
the best skaters in the world.
Yeah.
Well, it's all working out
for you boys.
You know what l'm thinking, bros?
We're gonna be on summer vacation
for the next 20 years.
Yeah.
Dude, that's nasty, man.
-Hey! Hey, man! My car!
-Oh, my God.
-You're too slow!
-Get over here!
Kiss my ass, jack!
You little knob-rocking butt clown!
What's happening, boys?
How's the pool?
All right, Tony, let me get a shot
of you right here...
...holding your board, like, strong.
Above your head, yeah?
Get right underneath him.
Don't lose that shot.
Give me the street thing.
That is great.
Jay!
Just one shot.
You're from Dogtown?
What does that mean?
Venice, man. Ghetto by the sea.
lt's dirty. lt's filthy. lt's paradise.
Okay, let's get all the Z-Boys
in the pool now.
-Sid's gonna love it.
-Oh, Sid!
Stacy, Jay and Tony, man.
They couldn't buy that publicity.
Red Dog, man, check it out.
You're in there. You're a hero, man.
Montoya!
-No way.
-Yeah.
-No.
-Rock star, man!
That's it, man.
Six-page article, man.
lt's Jay boy!
Hey, what's up, baby?
<i>Hey, Skipper. When are we doing
that spread for People magazine?
Tuesday?
<i>Yeah, and Stacy's gonna be
on Charlie's Angels!
Movie star now, huh?
They couldn't even make it
in the water.
They couldn't even surf the cove
without me saying so.
Who wants to surf that
toxic-waste dump anyways?
What did you say?
Nothing.
Hey, hey, hey! Whatever, man.
-This is for locals only.
-Beat it, drag queen.
Would you make
an exception for us?
Baby doll, let me just say
l'm willing to negotiate.
-Thanks, Tony.
-You're welcome.
What's going on?
-Hey, Mr. Alva.
-What's up?
l took what the dentist told me to take,
but l don't feel anything.
That's the point, babe. Come on.
-Show us how it's done.
-The girls love the ass.
Oh, man.
You just gotta--
You just gotta let it hang.
You'll throw your back out.
Guys, listen up!
<i>Half-breed
<i>That's all we ever heard
<i>Half-breed
<i>Until we heard the word
<i>Z-Boys on the cover of
Skateboard Magazine
l already got hair on my chest.
This is Sid.
Check out the rack.
-Hi, Sid.
-Hey, Thunder Monkey, what's...?
Are you thirsty?
You want something to drink?
Yeah.
l'm always thirsty.
For that.
So, what's happening?
You are. You're happening, Sid.
Everybody's talking about you,
you know.
At school and in the magazines
and on the street.
-Are you okay?
-Oh, yeah. No, l'm good.
-You're looking good.
-Thank you.
l like that belt...
...and the zipper.
And the feather.
-Check it out.
-l guess l'll have to see the design.
l don't ever want you to wear
underwear around me again, okay?
Hey, Stacy.
What's up, bro?
You couldn't even tell me?
Dude, l was gonna tell you.
When?
You're my friend.
Dude, l know, and l love you, bro...
...but you couldn't handle her.
And you can?
Apparently so.
Hey, Carlos.
Stacy. Where you going?
-Tell me l'm a great skater.
-You are a great skater, Sid.
You're the best skater on the team.
Gnarly.
-They're all yours, Sid.
-That's right.
Speed wobble!
Wait.
lt's not-- lt's not over yet, right?
No, Sid, it's not over.
Not even close.
lt's not over. lt's okay.
-Man, there's Topper Burks.
-Yeah, Topper Burks.
What brings you all the way
to this side of town?
Heard there was a party
in my favorite surf ghetto.
Yeah?
Where's the famous Tony Alva?
l wanna congratulate him.
Yeah, l'll congratulate him
for you, man.
Topper! Hey, man! Over here.
Hi, Topper.
Hey, Tony.
l'm Topper Burks.
l know who you are, dude.
Skip warned me about you.
l bet he did.
l think your boy Topper
is doing business.
You're blowing it, Tony.
Look, asshole,
l'm not blowing anything.
How much are these?
More than your car.
l don't own a car, dude.
Exactly.
Do you have any idea how many
skateboards he's selling...
...because of you?
A shitload.
Yeah.
With your talent...
...and my money...
...l can make you a star.
Hey, Jay.
l saw you in the magazine.
That was bitchen.
Jesus Christ, girl.
Ain't you Chino's old lady?
No. lt's like he won't leave me alone.
Well, l wouldn't either.
Can l suck on your panties?
<i>Tiki! Tiki! Tiki!
l just got laid.
Thunder Monkey's all over
my shit, dude.
l told you, Thunder Monkey,
he'd be freaked.
Congratulations, bro.
lt's about time.
Stacy, l need to talk to you.
l really need to talk to you.
Sit down. Sit down, sit down.
You guys know how many boards
Skip's selling because of us?
lf he ain't gonna flow us,
then l'm bailing.
We can't bail on Skip, man.
We're family.
l'm not gonna hang around this shop
like Chino and Montoya.
-This is our time, bros!
-Dude, that's bullshit, bro.
We surf and we skate every day.
We get to do whatever we want.
No, you guys gotta
think bigger, man!
l wanna make money,
get laid every night.
l wanna do it all right fucking now.
Hell, yeah. l'm gonna make out
with two chicks tonight.
Yeah, l mean, those boys are
getting too big for their boots.
Whatever you say, Skip.
Come on, don't you get it?
The boys are getting offers.
So cut them in on
some of the profits!
What profits, dickhead?
This is a surf shop!
-That's not the point!
-Later.
You wanna get rich, Skip?
-Go pimp yourself.
-Oh, yeah?
This isn't about fame or money.
lt never has been.
No? Until you put those kids
in magazines...
...they didn't care about
either one, genius.
Well, they do now.
-Here's where you been, my little devil.
-You found me somehow.
<i>-l don't know.
-Are you cold, papi?
l don't know, seriously.
What do you think you're doing?
-Hey, what's up, Chino?
-What's your problem?
Jay's the one with the problem.
Shut up.
No, l'm just waiting here for my girl.
lt's cool, man.
lt's cool. Oh, it's cool.
l almost forgot, Jay.
Everything is cool because you're
a famous skateboarder, huh?
lt's cool.
lt's cool.
-Oh, my God.
-lt's cool!
Jay!
No! Stop it! Stop!
You're gonna kill him!
You're gonna be next, bitch!
Step off, man.
Mellow out, man.
Come on!
Who wants a free surfboard?
Yeah, Billy, you want me
to give away the shop, man?
Then here's your share
of the profits, man!
l'm out of here!
You don't see this crap
on the North Shore!
Yeah, this one's for your mommy!
Zephyr parties are great.
Who wants some free surfboards?
-l'm out of here, buddy.
-Come on, man.
Hey, Jay.
<i>Look at him, man. All vato'd out.
Topper, this is Jay Adams.
What's up, Jay?
What's up, man?
Hey, bro. Tony's gonna
make a lot of money.
Why don't you come hang with us.
-Maybe another time.
-Cool.
l'll see you around, bro.
-Hey, Jay.
-Hey.
-What do l owe you for the beer?
-Five bucks.
Yes. Thank you.
Hey.
l'm thinking of moving to Oregon
to raise chickens and goats.
-Then l could grow my own herb.
-Hey.
Hey, Mom. Who is that guy?
He looks like a cop.
No, Jay. This is cool.
l want you to meet
a friend of your uncle.
Hey, Jay. Peter Darling,
LaFond and Barnett Advertising.
-Should we go talk in the kitchen?
-Sure. Let's go.
Jay...
...has anybody told you
you have that California look?
No.
You do.
Excuse me.
Hey, Jay, l was wondering...
...would you mind removing that--
That thing from your head?
Right.
Well, Jay, with the current
skate craze, we at the firm...
...feel that you would be the perfect
spokesman for our new client, Slinky.
Would you mind singing
for me right now?
Who are you, man? Really.
Let me sing the tune for you, okay?
You want me to sing that?
We're prepared to offer you...
...$ 1 0,000.
For one day's work. One day.
Give it a shot, baby. Give it a shot.
Jay...
...you got the part.
l'm not what you're looking for, man.
Hey, man. People have been
telling me about this club, man.
-Hey, what's up, Sneaky?
-What's up?
Joker.
What's up, homey?
You're gonna get it,
you little motherfucker!
Come on, you little pussy! Get up!
Get off me! Get off!
l'll fucking kill that motherfucker!
Get the fuck up!
-Fucking faggot!
-Go fuck yourself....
Hey, Skip.
Stacy. Have a seat, man.
l want to talk to you about something.
How you been?
Yeah? You all right?
Listen, man, you know it's not
about a team anymore. Yeah?
lt's about you, man.
This is all gonna be about you.
l thought l wasn't a pirate.
Hey, man. l never said that, man.
l mean, did l?
You didn't even want me
on the team.
l was pushing you, man. Come on.
Listen, Skip.
l'm sorry, you know. l mean--
l have....
l've been talking to Larry--
l have these injection molding cavities
coming in, man. Check it out.
l'm gonna hire night workers
and run this shop like a factory, man.
Just churn them out, one by one.
Well, is anyone else involved?
Well, hey, man, l can't be worried...
...about what everyone else
is doing, you know?
l mean, l'm focused on
what l'm doing.
l'm gonna build hundreds
of skateboards a month...
...all with your name,
''Stacy Peralta.''
Right there, next to ''Zephyr.''
What do you think, man?
So, what do you say, bro?
Okay.
That's all right.
l dig that one.
You heard it from the boss's mouth.
Racers ready!
Set!
Stacy!
Stacy!
Racers ready!
Set!
All right, Tony!
-Take two.
-And action.
Cut. Cut. l'm only seeing hair here.
Here.
-Stacy.
-Stacy!
Alva.
Hey, can l try that?
Thanks.
That's a little harder than it looks.
-l sucked.
-One more.
-Moon boots, you know?
-Yeah.
Stacy, thank you
for speaking with us.
Good? Let's do one more,
and we'll take a break.
Wow, you're famous, Stace.
The God Squad.
Kathy, l was the last one
to leave the Zephyr team.
Both your brother and Jay
left without even telling Skip.
This is my girlfriend, Caroline.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
You too.
Everyone sees it
their own way, l guess.
-Good luck, Stacy.
-Stacy. Let's do it.
Skateboarding's been great. Thinking
about buying a new Trans Am.
Black on black,
with some big fat tires on the back.
Give me one second.
Hey.
What's going on?
How was Australia?
How was the...? How was the surf?
l couldn't surf. They had me
going all over doing demos and stuff.
You went to Australia
and you didn't surf?
Yeah, l know.
Yeah, well, he's a working man now.
So how's your sponsor?
Well, they help me pay
the rent for my mom.
They were supposed to have...
...his signature board ready
three months ago.
Get back.
What's up, boys?
Where's your lasso,
Wonder Woman?
Remember, class among gruel.
T.A. T.A.
What's up, Stacy?
Poor guy's so straight,
he doesn't even cast a shadow.
You guys even
skate with him anymore?
The dude's competing with the sun
for the center of the universe.
Stace.
Man...
...Stacy looks like a stock car.
Jay. What do you say, man?
Bro. Your board is bionic, bro.
This isn't the board l designed.
This wood is cheap.
No, no, no. That's solid wood.
Jay, we're trying to make you
a big chunk of change...
...but the boards you want
are a tad bit too expensive to sell.
How do you know until you sell it?
Jay. Jay, look,
you don't know business.
You don't understand. Hey!
You don't understand. He doesn't
understand business, right?
You guys aren't living up
to your word.
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Look.
Cut the agent crap, Sid. All right?
You're a little rich boy
who can't skate for shit.
You wouldn't even exist
if it weren't for old Jay.
-All right?
-Yeah.
-l know where your shit's at.
-Make it happen with Jay.
-Make it happen.
-lt's okay.
Hey, bro, look who's here.

<i>This is a Channel 7 News
special report.
<i>Pacific Ocean Park Pier,
infamous local surf spot...
<i>...burned to the ground last night.
<i>This is the latest in a series of fires
that have plagued the park...
<i>...since it was
officially closed in 1 967.
<i>Pacific Ocean Park,
once described as superior...
<i>...to Coney Island in New York,
to the boardwalk in Atlantic City...
<i>...lies in smoldering ruins today...
<i>...and is now nothing more than
a bunch of fond memories.
Look who's here.
Bastards didn't send fire trucks
for over six hours or something.
Yeah, they wanted it gone.
They wanted it gone.
You know, the pier has been here
for over 40 years.
Get behind the perimeter, all of you.
Set it up 500 yards down the beach.
Bring it back up to the highway.
You know that's where
l learned to surf? Right there.
They look at the cove as a shithole.
l mean, thank God, man,
because in winter this place goes off.
We had it all to ourselves.
We had it all to ourselves, man.
You're right.
l have no reason
to come here anymore.
Hey.
Sorry l left, man.
l just had to pay the rent.
Hey, man.
Your mama, she has to eat, right?
She has to eat.
-Hey, bro.
-What's up, T.A.?
T.A.!
What's this?
Shit.
-Topper, man.
-Little brother.
-Hey, man. Put these on.
-No, no, no! lt's cool, man.
Sorry.
Hey, man.
We got all the meds you need.
We're going to Maui
and get you on some real waves.
Get in the limo.
l told you, they're operating
again on Thursday.
T.A.!
l love you, man.
l want you to come.
l'll send you a ticket.
Let's go.
So are you a good pirate
or a bad pirate?
Ahoy, captain.
Shit.
So how are you doing?
-l feel like shit.
-Yeah?
But the doctor says
l'm getting better.
You'll be back on top
again soon, man.
You gotta give it time.
l'm gonna end up a ditchdigger.
Hey.
Hey, look at me, boy.
You remember you're an Alva.
You've got a lot of heart...
...and a lot of balls.
Hey, come on.
Yeah!
Let's go. Come on.
What's up, homey?
You looking at me?
-You looking at me?
-We were leaving.
-Looking at me?
-Just checking things out.
Nice Rolex you got there, man.
You sure you want that?
-You sure about that?
-No, man. Hey, man.
No, he's cool. He's cool.
-Jay.
-Hey. How you doing, man?
-What's up, dude?
-How's it going?
Man, nice ride.
Where you been, Jay?
l mean, l didn't even see you
at the Arizona contest.
Well, l don't really
skate malls for money, bro.
Hey, Kathy, come here.
-Nice car, man.
-Hey, Stacy.
Hey, Stacy. How you doing?
Hey.
Jay tell you about Sid?
He's sick, man.
What do you mean?
He's always been sick.
No, he's real sick.
That whole equilibrium thing
turned out to be a tumor.
Brain cancer.
What? Are you serious?
Yeah, it's bad.
They operated already.
He's gonna be back home
this weekend.
Yeah, we're all gonna go hang out.
You should come.
Wrong.
We ain't gonna
go see him like that.
Yeah, l can't go.
l gotta go to Florida.
Tony's supposed to be there.
Come on, Jay. You gonna
make out with him or what, eh?
So...
...l'll see you at the mall.
All right, Jay.
l think we should put these new shirts
on sale. What do you think?
-Hey, how you doing? Come on in.
-Hey, how's it going, man?
Do you know when my board's
gonna be ready?
l know my guy started on it already.
Let me go check it out.
Hey, Skip? We got an ETA
on that 6'7'' twin fin?
Yeah, tell the kid he'll be surfing
by Saturday, boss.
Beautiful. Okay. Thank you.
How about Saturday?
At 1 0:30 it'll be ready.
Now, we've got
a wet-suit sale going on.
Dude.
You look like shit.
Let me see that thing.
Yeah, mine's real.
Dang.
lt's pretty punk rock, bro.
l don't have to lift a finger anymore.
l don't have to take out the trash.
l don't even have to
brush my own teeth.
Am l King Tut or what?
Yeah, my doctor prescribes it now.
Heard you were sick too.
Hell, yeah.
So did you get ahold of T.A.?
He and Stacy are off
making their millions.
Sorry, dude.
No big deal.
Hey, if you do croak...
...will you give your house
to my mom?
Only if she lets me see her tits first.
lt's awfully nice of you to bequeath
your star-athlete-like presence...
...among us lower life forms.
Sid, man.
So, what happened to Florida?
The Kona Bowl.
Yeah, l guess l missed my flight.
Won't Larry crucify you for that?
l'm leaving G & S.
l'm gonna start my own company.
l've already got a logo.
Oh, you got a logo?
Man, screw the team.
l mean, you got a logo.
-Sid, l'll just come back later, man.
-No, wait. Stace.
You have to come check something
out in the back, by the pool.
You too, asshole.
Dudes, look in the deep end.
There's a Mexican in my pool,
and he ain't pushing a lawn mower.
Don't make me come up there
and kick your ass, Sid.
Peralta.
You finally got your
shadow back, huh?
What's up, chrome-dome?
What's the zipper for?
Easy access.
He doesn't have to inhale anymore.
He just unzips and pours.
What are you girls waiting for?
My dad said we can trash it.
Oh, my God.
Guys, let's get him in here.
Oh, yeah.
No.
Okay. Wait, wait.
l think this'll be
the first pool session...
...where we don't have to worry
about getting busted.
-You all right?
-Yeah.
Okay.
-Hey, guys. Let's get him in the drain.
-Jesus--
All right.
Lock in, bud.
Sid.
Look, Squid.
l'll let you bang my mom.
You little punk.
-Sid, you okay?
-Yeah.
Hey, Sid. Do you wanna carve?
l'm first.
We got you, bro.
-Squiddles, we got you.
-Man down!
Oh, yeah. You did a kick turn, Sid.
Sid.
What are you doing?
Don't be idiots!
-Sorry.
-Yeah. Sorry.
l'm fine.
Sorry, señorita.
Here. Put me over here.
Can you bring me some herb?
-Oh, my-- You all right?
-Yeah.
