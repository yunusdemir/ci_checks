My love is vengeance.
That's never free.
David?
Uh, it's not much, it's, uh,
it's a bit drippy sometimes,
isn't it?
But we're happy.
Cube sweet cube.
We've been here
for about an hour.
No. What's the word?
Um... "soup"?
No, don't think it's soup.
We've been here
longer than that.
Anyhoo...
Oh. What happened.
Uh, well...
the world ended.
Oh... sweetheart,
don't be so dramatic.
-It didn't end.
-It...
-It's still out there.
-I'm exaggerating.
-Sunrise, sunset.
-She had some...
-You know, everybody
toiling away.
-Toil, toil, toil.
-You know, good versus evil,
all that sort of thing.
-Mm-hmm.
We just...
well, we just don't...
-do that sort of thing anymore.
-No.
We were just losing
too much hair.
Time. Time.
It was time that we were losing,
uh, my beloved and I.
Mm.
-Groom and bride.
-Hmm.
-Our bodies.
What do we do with...
-Our bodies.
...what do we do
with our bodies?
They're... safe.
Um, somewhere.
They're hidden.
To tell you the location
would be un... genius.
I-It's actually better
without them.
-Mm.
-You know, all those
aches and pains and...
-aging.
-Mm-hmm.
Not to mention various gases.
Oh! Stop.
Oh, but it's
so much more romantic now.
It's just...
well, every meal is a feast,
-every day a blessing.
-Hmm.
"O dandelion, rich and haughty,
"King of village flowers!
"Each day is coronation time,
"You have no humble hours.
"I like to see you
bring a troop
"To beat the bluegrass spears,
"To scorn the lawnmower
"that would be like
fate's triumphant shears.
"Your yellow heads
are cut away,
"It seems your reign is o'er.
"By noon you raise
a sea of stars
More golden than before."
-We miss them, our friends.
-We miss people. Of course.
-You know, our coworkers,
-Mm-hmm.
like, um...
of course, uh,
Glasses McLabcoat
and, uh, the...
-...the-the girl who would kick,
-Oh.
-kick everyone, I miss her.
-Yeah.
Oh, and Sydney.
Don't forget Sydney.
-I had forgotten Sydney, yes.
-Oh, it...
oh, what happened to her
was so sad.
Very sad. Uh...
What was it
that happened to her again?
-The betrayal.
-She was betrayed.
-After the fight with Farouk,
-Mm.
when David...
-The Turn.
-...turned.
The Turn. Uh...
there was a great battle with...
what's his face.
-Fa... Farouk.
-Farouk. Farouk.
Uh, very soothing voice,
I found. Very hypnotic.
Mmm.
I remember helping him.
Yes, I... I do, too.
Hmm.
Why did he turn again,
this David person?
Because she showed him
his future.
No.
No, no, no, no.
We need to talk.
Sure.
Let me just finish killing
this asshole.
You haven't had a lot of
girlfriends, or you'd know--
when a woman wants to talk,
you talk.
Could you maybe not point
that thing at me?
You read the stories.
The women who marry serial
killers and have six kids--
meanwhile, he's driving
around Portland every night
with a van full of duct tape.
What?
They have to know.
Right? The wives, deep down.
At least a feeling,
something's wrong.
I know, with you. Now.
Syd, I'm the good guy.
He's the monster.
No.
You're not that.
A good guy?
I thought so for a long time.
And then I saw
the things you hide.
And it hit me.
What if you're not the hero?
What if you're
just another villain?
The real villain.
Why? 'Cause...
because I didn't tell you
the whole truth?
Because I-I left?
-He kills people.
-You...
kill people.
Dozens at Division 3 last year.
No. That was him.
He had c-control.
The Son of Sam had a dog
who gave him commands,
but every time he pulled the
trigger, he pulled the trigger.
Seriously,
why are you doing this?
I... know.
That's the thing.
I've seen your true face.
You hid it so well.
I love you.
Maybe.
But here's what matters more.
You lie to me.
You leave me.
-You keep secrets.
-No.
You're doing it right now.
Unless maybe you don't know
the difference-- truth, lie.
Maybe...
it's not even your fault.
He was in your head for so long,
poisoning every thought.
Are you okay? Y-Your neck,
that's a lot of blood.
It's not mine.
Listen to me,
I know it's been hard...
I saw what you did to Oliver.
To the soldiers at Division 3.
I saw the look on your face.
You liked it.
No, I did what I had to.
You tortured Oliver.
You were beating him to death.
That's not a love story.
Wait, I...
I'm just, we're just,
this is...
We're just doing
what you said. You.
This is war. We're in a war.
What am I willing to do?
How far am I willing to go?
-I know I said that, but...
-And that's all I'm doing.
That is all I am doing--
what you said.
No. No.
Baby, please.
What happened
to "God loves the sinners best"?
It won't work.
We're all powerless now.
Goddamn it, put the gun down
and talk to me.
He's gonna... it's gonna
wear off, and then he'll be--
you heard them-- unstoppable.
And, look, I'm sorry
if you have abandonment issues.
And I was taken away by you,
if we're being--
if we're laying all our cards
out on the table,
so think about that.
I didn't leave.
You kidnapped me
from the future.
Did you ever ask why?
Why would I do that?
Reach out from the future?
Why ask you to help Farouk
find his body?
Because of the world--
the end of the world?
And who does that,
end the world? Not him, right?
Otherwise, why would I ask you
to save him?
I don't know. You wouldn't,
you didn't tell me.
-It's you.
-What's me?
You're the one who destroys
everything, who ends the world.
No.
It never occurred to you
that you're the problem,
not the solution.
-H-How could you even...
-He showed me-- Farouk.
He went to see her, too--
me, in the future--
after you quit.
See, in her timeline,
you killed Farouk,
and then there was no one
powerful enough to stop you
-when you turned.
-When I...
So she tricked you
into helping him-- your enemy--
so that he could stop you
when you showed us
who you really are.
I know.
It's cold to do that to someone
that you used to love.
Used to?
Baby, please, I'm right here.
Your man. Don't you trust me?
Maybe I just trust myself more.
No. He's...
You're being tricked.
Syd, please.
Syd, please.
You know me.
Yeah, I do.
And guess what?
You're not the hero.
Then who is?
Me.
A delusion
starts like any other idea,
as an egg.
Identical on the outside,
perfectly formed.
From the shell, you'd never
know anything was wrong.
A delusion starts
like any other idea,
as an egg.
Identical on the outside,
perfectly formed.
You see it now,
-don't you?
-Where...?
A delusion starts
like any other idea...
Stop it. Stop it.
...as an egg.
A delusion starts
like any other idea,
as an egg.
You're the chicken, man.
She said I killed
all those people...
-in the future.
-You're delusional, baby.
No, I'm not.
I'm not crazy. I'm not.
All the voices,
the things I saw,
they said I was schizophrenic,
but that was a...
They didn't know the truth,
what I am, who I am.
I have powers, I'm powerful.
And then Syd came,
and now I know.
- I know that I'm...
- What?
Normal?
No. Special.
A mutant. Omega.
I'm the one who saves them.
-Who?
-Everybody. I-I-I'm the hero.
I save love. You get it?
Farouk, he's the devil.
What he did to me,
what he does to everybody...
Why can't she see that?
-Saint David.
-No, I'm not saying that.
I make mistakes, but...
I'm trying to help people.
A delusion starts
like any other idea...
...starts
like any other idea...
...as an egg.
You stop saying that.
You know what your delusion is?
Hold the phone.
Is that...? Who's that?
Ooh, a dark horse candidate,
late entry to the race.
There. You see it?
The egg cracked just then,
and the delusion was born.
What are you talking about?
I'm a good person.
I deserve love.
I'm a good person.
I deserve love.
In order
for a delusion to thrive,
other, more rational ideas
must be destroyed.
I'm a good person.
So I deserve love.
No. That's not...
She saved me.
She showed me what I could be.
She made me good.
She made you good?
So, what,
you weren't good before?
David Haller,
the little piece of shit.
No, that's not...
That's just... words.
You're-you're-you're trying
to confuse me.
She said, "Junkies
and masochists and hookers
"and those who have
squandered everything
are the ring of brightest angels
around heaven."
Oh, I remember.
God loves the sinners best.
A delusion starts...
Do you really believe that?
Deep down? That God loves you?
Don't listen to him.
There is no God.
Except you.
So the question is,
do you love yourself?
No, that's not what I'm...
She said...
Stop doing that!
Making her right. All of them.
Caring about what they think.
They owe you everything.
This world.
A baby abandoned by his parents
with a demon stuck in his head.
Used, tricked, judged,
chucked in a Dumpster
like fat from a clinic.
And they tell you it's you.
That you're disgusting,
like somebody's used condom
that keeps getting stuck
to people's shoes.
You want to know the truth?
They're terrified
you're gonna wake up one day
and realize you're a god,
that you don't need any of them.
So they put you
in a mental hospital.
You are not helping.
He is sick. I'm trying to...
No, they're sick.
She's sick.
This blonde thing
who pretends to love us,
lowers our defenses,
crawls inside our head.
She's the delusion,
the parasite.
Stop it. That is not...
We are in love. That is real.
Our love is real.
Then why'd she just shoot you?
He's got a point.
Oh.
Syd, please. You know me.
Yeah, I do.
Shit.
And guess what?
You're not the hero.
Take that...
-Then who is?
-...mother...
Me.
Oops.
Halt! Don't move,
you're surrounded.
A delusion
starts like any other idea...
So, we know what we have to do.
Yes.
David, I need you to say it.
Yes.
I know what I have to do.
This is going to hurt.
What happened?
You had a bad dream.
Give me a minute.
What are you gonna do with him?
There will be a trial.
You will be expected to testify.
Of course. Just be careful.
Remember, you can't believe
anything he says.
It's, uh, straight to
the electric chair for me, kid.
No, God has plans for you.
I don't believe in God.
I think you do.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, yeah, just... long day.
Yeah, we fought a Minotaur.
You're pretty beaten up.
Come to the lab,
let me do a CAT scan.
No, I just need some sleep.
I'll join you.
No, if-if you don't mind,
I just need some sleep.
You have your own room.
Just for tonight.
It's right near ours.
I'll show you.
We agreed.
This isn't the plan.
I can fix it.
Another delusion.
I just need time.
You saw Syd,
she didn't remember.
A trick. You tricked her.
It can't last.
She's confused.
I just need...
we just need time together
so she can remember
what we had. Have.
No, we don't belong here,
with them.
Anyway, Farouk's still alive.
I got to finish it.
Oh, now you're changing
the story.
Would you just
get out of my head?
I'm trying to think.
Syd, my love...
Sixth floor
purge in three, two, one...
How are you...?
It's a projection.
My body's in my room,
but my mind's here.
We don't need the White Room
anymore to do this.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
Syd...
Hmm?
Run away with me.
What?
We just go,
right now, you and me.
Find a cabin
by a lake somewhere.
Get a dog, some chickens.
Start a farm.
What about Farouk?
-The trial?
-After.
The moment he's dead,
we go and never come back.
What?
Nothing.
You seem...
...different.
Maybe it's me.
After everything
we've been through.
We're together now.
That's all that matters.
Don't you see? It's over.
It's over. We won.
We won.
How's it feel,
knowing I beat you?
Knowing you lost?
Did I?
Well, you're in a cage,
powerless,
about to be executed.
Oh, no,
they won't kill me.
I'm too...
Valuable.
They'll put me deep
in a basement somewhere,
a secret weapon.
No, you're gonna die.
What makes you so sure?
Because if they don't kill you
tomorrow,
I will.
Mm-hmm.
You tried once,
and yet here I am.
You know what I missed the most,
being locked in that grave
for 30 years?
Coffee.
Be a dear and make me a cup.
No.
I give the orders now.
It wasn't an order.
It was a request.
The last request of a dying man.
Don't do that--
try to make me feel sympathy
for you.
Why not?
Is it working?
Go to hell.
I'm leaving.
I just came to...
What? Gloat?
No.
To say good-bye.
Good-bye.
It's really sick,
what you're doing to her.
Don't you think?
Your love.
How do y...
The horse with the bridle
can still walk.
I saw you on the hill,
what you did to her--
suppressing her memory,
tricking her
into loving you again.
I didn't trick her.
She loves me.
She just f-forgot.
Oh, and you helped her remember
by controlling her.
What a kind man you are.
Shut up.
Trust me...
You can't make someone love you.
I've tried.
With who, your toadies?
No.
With you.
For 30 years,
since you were a baby.
My baby.
Oh, please.
You make me sick.
You know that? Physically sick.
Every time I look at you,
every time I hear your voice,
I want to throw up.
Good.
Remember that feeling,
because soon you will see it
in her eyes
when she looks at you.
I love you, too.
You look ridiculous.
I'm reconstructing
what happened on the hill
from available sensor data.
Did I tell you I cut off
the head of a Minotaur?
Yes, you did. In graphic detail.
Do you know what its blood
smelled like?
Oh, please, Kerry...
Okay, this is weird.
You remember those, like,
beef bouillon cubes
-from when we were kids?
-Stop.
The kind that you would pour
boiling water onto?
Stop.
It didn't taste like that,
though.
Oh, no.
What?
It's treachery.
In the old days--
not so long ago--
madmen were packed onto boats
and shipped off to sea.
They were said to be searching
for their lost sanity.
They called these boats...
the Ship of Fools.
And for a long time,
we thought
we were the sane ones,
left behind on dry land.
But what if we're not?
What if so much time has passed
that we've forgotten the truth?
That we are, in fact,
the fools...
afloat on an endless sea,
pretending to be...
normal.
David.
Over here.
Just want to thank you.
You saved us all.
That's what I do.
Where's Farouk?
They're bringing him in now.
Let me just... I have a few
questions before we get started.
Let me just grab my pad.
Yeah, okay.
Aah! Syd? What's...
Whoa!
Aw...
David, stop.
Please?
I know that you don't want
to believe me,
-but we want to help you.
-Let me out. Now.
David Haller, your
treachery has been discovered.
The inevitability
of your future crimes.
We are informed
by Sydney Barrett
and the Shadow King
of events that will transpire
in the days to come.
The remains of the orb that
took you have been analyzed.
The probability
that they have been created
decades from now
by the male Loudermilk is 98%.
Th... This is a mistake.
Future crimes?
Things I might do?
Are you...
Wha...?
Wait.
What's...
what's really going on?
- This is you.
- No...
Seeing you like this--
what you have become--
the sweet boy
undone by revenge...
...it fills my heart
with such sorrow.
Liar.
David, I know
how hard this was for you.
What he did to you.
The life that you lived.
To think that you were sick
for all those years,
and then to be told
that it was a lie,
that you have these powers.
This monster in your head,
everything Melanie said,
that you weren't mentally ill,
-when the truth is...
-Syd.
...you're both.
I told you.
Why didn't you listen?
You see what she is?
What they are?
Small-minded animals,
terrified of what
they can't comprehend.
No, shut up and let me think.
Just let me think.
Uh...
Something I do in the future?
That hasn't happened yet?
That isn't even me?
Don't you see? This is
some kind of mass psychosis.
You're upset.
Your mind can't reconcile
the person we see
with the person
you think you are.
But we can help.
Medicine and therapy.
Back to the psych ward?
David the zombie.
Well, bullshit.
You want me gone so bad?
Fine, I'm gone.
- No.
- You will allow treatment,
or we will be forced
to terminate.
- You're gonna kill me?
- Run.
Get out.
No. No.
I want to hear you say it.
That you're gonna kill me
if I don't let them turn me
into something different.
Something easy.
Something clean.
David.
You drugged me...
...and had sex with me.
No, that's not...
I need you.
I am a good person.
I deserve love.
I am a good person.
I deserve love.
I deserve love.
I deserve...
-I'm a good person.
-I deserve love.
You know what? I'm done.
You had your chance.
- David...
- No.
Cary...
The gas.
Cary?
The field should hold.
Secure the building.
Secure the building.
Secure the building.
I'm going. Right now.
You coming?
Shit, yeah.
What about blondie?
There ain't no blondie no more.
What do we do now?
Now I get it.
