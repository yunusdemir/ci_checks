Have a look at this.
I'm going to take two living sponges.
These are fresh out of the sea.
And I'm going to utterly destroy them.
<i>I'm going to reduce this piece of sponge
to its individual cells.</i>
Now it's wrapped up in this nylon mesh,
and this is acting as a kind of a sieve.
So now I'm going to squeeze it
through this sieve.
<i>What's left is nothing like a sponge,
a liquid containing cells.</i>
<i>You might think
I'd totally killed the sponge,</i>
<i>but if I leave these
individual cells overnight,</i>
<i>something really
rather astonishing happens.</i>
<i>As the hours pass,
the cells start to move.</i>
<i>Slowly, they shuffle
their way back together.</i>
<i>And by joining up,
they make a new piece of sponge.</i>
Oh, look at that purple one.
I mean, such a striking result.
Almost all of the individual cells
have gone.
It's as if the cells have acted
like individuals
with a purpose and they have actually
reaggregated into a piece
of sponge tissue.
It's amazing.
<i>This experiment was first done
over 100 years ago</i>
<i>and it raised
some really enormous questions.</i>
<i>How do cells know what to do?</i>
<i>What goes on inside cells?</i>
<i>How do these tiny structures
make living organisms?</i>
<i>If we find the answers
to these questions,</i>
<i>we'll find out what makes things alive,
the secret of life itself.</i>
If you think about it,
it's pretty incredible.
Cells are just tiny bags
full of molecules.
But how those lifeless molecules
bundle together to create life
was a fundamental mystery.
So the challenge for the scientists
who first began to study the cell
was to unravel the chemistry of life.
<i>It was here in Germany, 150 years ago,</i>
<i>that scientists set out
to tackle the mysteries of the cell.</i>
<i>They discovered that plants,
animals, people,</i>
<i>all living things, in fact,
are made up of tiny cells.</i>
<i>Doctors began probing the cells
of the human body.</i>
<i>Organs and tissues became
specimens to be preserved,</i>
<i>sliced and put under the microscope.</i>
<i>What they saw and drew
showed that every organ and tissue</i>
<i>is made of different types of cells
working together.</i>
<i>And that all cells
come from other cells.</i>
<i>New ones are only made
when cells split in two.</i>
<i>Somehow, cells must contain
the secret of life itself.</i>
<i>But scientists knew nothing
about what went on inside these cells.</i>
The problem was that
when doctors and scientists
looked down the microscope at cells,
what they could see
didn't tell them much.
They could see that cells
were enclosed by a boundary,
a membrane,
and that there was a dense bit
in the middle
that they called the nucleus.
This was surrounded
by a jelly-like gloop
that they called protoplasm.
But the problem was that
these were just blobs within blobs.
They didn't know
what the blobs were for,
or even what they were made of.
<i>The first step towards understanding
the working of cells,</i>
<i>came in the small German town
called Tübingen.</i>
<i>It was a centre
of scientific excellence.</i>
<i>Europe's first biochemistry lab
was established in the local castle.</i>
<i>One of the aims was to find out
more about human cells.</i>
<i>And it was here, in 1868,</i>
<i>that a keen young scientist
Dr Friedrich Miescher arrived</i>
<i>to take up his first research post.</i>
Miescher's job here at the castle
was to study the chemistry
of white blood cells.
He decided to look at the large nucleus
at the centre of the cell
and find out what it was made of.
To do this, he needed two things,
a ready supply of cells
and a way of getting rid of the gloop
so he could study the bare nucleus.
<i>Getting hold of white blood cells
would normally have been tricky,</i>
<i>but Tübingen was the ideal place.</i>
<i>The region had been at war with Prussia.</i>
<i>Hundreds of injured soldiers
with infected wounds</i>
<i>lay in the barracks
next to the hospital.</i>
Their wounds were oozing
copious amounts of pus,
which is full of white blood cells.
So, revolting as it sounds,
Miescher collected their old bandages
so he could scrape off the pus.
<i>Miescher needed something else.</i>
<i>His next stop
was the local slaughterhouse</i>
<i>to collect a pig's stomach.</i>
Oh, look, here it is.
(LAUGHING) Oh, it's disgusting.
<i>He was interested in the mucus
that lined the stomach.</i>
<i>This contains an enzyme called pepsin,</i>
<i>which helps breakdown and digest food.</i>
- Where's the pepsin?
- Look here, this. This is the pepsin.
- Ah, this little gloopy stuff.
- Yeah.
RUTHERFORD: There's not much of it.
THOMAS: No, that's all.
And this is what helps digest
the food in the stomach?
THOMAS: Yeah.
Smells like a pig's stomach to me.
<i>With the pepsin,</i>
<i>Miescher now had all he needed
for his experiment.</i>
- And this is a delicacy in Tübingen?
- Yes.
You can fill it with bread
or you can cut it in stripes.
And then you cook it
and eat it with bread.
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.
Not sure about that.
<i>Miescher carried the bandages
and the pig stomach back to the lab.</i>
<i>If he was right, the pepsin
would breakdown the white blood cells.</i>
<i>Then, for the very first time,
it would be possible</i>
<i>to examine the dense nucleus
at the heart of the cell.</i>
Nowadays, we do analyses like this
using precision equipment.
But, of course,
Miescher didn't have any kit like that.
So it wasn't easy.
First, he had to scrape the pus
from the bandages.
Now, this is mayonnaise,
but you get the idea.
Then, he had to wash the pepsin
out of the pig's stomach using an acid,
and mixed it with the pus.
After the enzyme had done its work
and digested the cells,
only then could he analyse
the nucleus on its own.
<i>Now the big question was,
"What did the nucleus consist of?"</i>
<i>Miescher spent months
analysing its chemistry,</i>
<i>and he found it contained
a rather strange molecule.</i>
<i>This molecule was made up of carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen.</i>
<i>He knew these elements
were found in all living things.</i>
<i>But this molecule contained
something extra,</i>
<i>phosphorus.</i>
<i>And that made it different,</i>
<i>very different.</i>
It was an entirely new kind of molecule.
Because he found it in the nucleus,
Miescher called it nucleon.
We now know it as DNA.
<i>Intrigued, Miescher repeated
his experiment on sperm cells</i>
<i>from frogs, carp, bulls and salmon.</i>
(CROAKING)
<i>Every time, he found
exactly the same molecule.</i>
Incredibly, some of it has survived.
Here, in this test tube,
is some of the first DNA ever isolated.
It's DNA from salmon sperm
that Miescher extracted in the 1870s.
Now it may not look like much,
but this brown powder
marks the beginning
of a scientific revolution.
<i>Miescher's discovery of DNA
was confirmation</i>
<i>that there was something special
inside the nucleus of cells,</i>
<i>a molecule that was common to all life.</i>
<i>But Miescher was way ahead of his time.</i>
<i>His work on the chemistry of the nucleus
went unnoticed,</i>
<i>because scientists still had little idea
of what the nucleus was for,</i>
<i>or of how cells worked.</i>
<i>It was the warm waters
of the Mediterranean</i>
<i>that gave them
an important breakthrough.</i>
<i>Here, scientists found a ready supply</i>
<i>of living cells
which they could easily study.</i>
<i>The embryos of the many species
of marine life that thrive here.</i>
Which is why the Bay of Naples
became the centre
of a remarkable scientific community,
scientists who were using the abundance
of creatures in the sea
to study how life is formed.
<i>At the heart of the community
was this marine station</i>
<i>built on the shores of Naples.</i>
<i>And in 1888,
another young German scientist</i>
<i>Theodor Boveri arrived here
to work on cells.</i>
<i>He'd be studying alongside</i>
<i>some of the most
eminent scientists of his day.</i>
<i>In fact, the marine station
was supported by Charles Darwin himself.</i>
(CHILDREN TALKING)
<i>The scientists built a public aquarium
to fund their research.</i>
<i>Then, as now,
it was a popular attraction.</i>
<i>And it provided
a ready supply of cell specimens,</i>
<i>because fish lay their eggs
straight into the water.</i>
<i>Boveri was interested
in the fertilisation of eggs.</i>
<i>Once the egg cell is fertilised,
it begins to divide.</i>
<i>It creates another cell,
and then another,</i>
<i>and so a new life is born.</i>
<i>Somehow, when the cells divide,</i>
<i>the essence of life
is passed from cell to cell.</i>
By the end of the century,
with better microscopes,
and new chemical dyes
to stain the cells,
embryologists were able to see
early dividing cells
in more detail than ever before.
And what they saw was incredible.
Have a look at some of these drawings.
<i>Scientists had thought
that when the cells divide,</i>
<i>they simply split down the middle.</i>
<i>But now, they began to see</i>
<i>that something far more complicated
was going on inside the nucleus.</i>
<i>As cells started to divide,</i>
<i>discreet objects like little rods
would appear inside the nucleus.</i>
<i>These rods seem to unravel
and split in two,</i>
<i>migrating to opposite ends
of the nucleus.</i>
<i>Then the nucleus would split in half,
followed by the cell itself.</i>
<i>Scientists called the rods
"Chromosomes",</i>
<i>meaning coloured bodies</i>
<i>because the chemical dyes
they were using gave them a colour.</i>
<i>And they saw
that these puzzling chromosomes</i>
<i>only appeared in the nucleus
when a cell divided.</i>
Now the obvious question
for any scientist looking at something
so complex and elaborate is, "Why?"
Why did the cells have to divide
in such a curious way?
<i>To find the answer,
Boveri devised an experiment.</i>
<i>He used a creature found in abundance
at the bottom of the bay.</i>
<i>My underwater guide is Dr Ina Arnone.</i>
<i>Ina works at the Naples marine station</i>
<i>on the same kind of creature
Boveri used,</i>
<i>the sea urchin.</i>
<i>The easy part about collecting
sea urchins is finding them.</i>
<i>Unlike fish,
they just stick to the rocks.</i>
<i>But without practice, picking them off
is harder than you think.</i>
<i>And the spines can really hurt.</i>
There it is, a sea urchin, plucked.
Plucked from the bottom
of the Bay of Naples.
There are thousands of them down there.
You can see why people use these
as experimental animals.
<i>The inside of a sea urchin</i>
<i>consists almost entirely
of its reproductive organs or gonads.</i>
INA: Oh, this is very good. Look.
Gonads, so big they are.
And you can recognise this is a male.
Because you see here?
ADAM: Oh, these are the gonads
and this is the...
INA: The white part is the sperm.
ADAM: Wow!
And fishermen, they believe
this is indeed the milk of the urchin.
All right. And this is a local delicacy
here as well, right?
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
Do you want to try?
ADAM: (LAUGHING) Of course.
- Shall I show you how to do it?
- Yeah, go on then.
Take this, little piece.
It's like eating the sea.
Let me try.
- So you just suck it out?
- Just suck it out.
(SLURPING)
Mmm.
- It's pretty salty.
- (LAUGHING) Oh, that's salty, yes.
ADAM: Why have people used these
for scientific research?
INA: That's pretty obvious.
They produce billions of eggs,
billions of sperm.
<i>And billions of eggs and sperm,
each of them single cells,</i>
<i>were just what Boveri needed
for his experiment.</i>
<i>Back in the lab,</i>
<i>all Boveri had to do
was simply shake the sea urchins.</i>
Like this.
<i>This stimulates
the sea urchins to spawn.</i>
Oh, so the orange powdery stuff
that's just falling off the bottom,
that's the eggs.
Exactly, they are falling down
and you will see them collecting
on the bottom.
<i>Boveri wanted to find out
what happened when cells divide.</i>
<i>So his starting point</i>
<i>was the moment when the egg
is fertilised by a sperm.</i>
You can see here the nucleus of the egg.
ADAM: This bit in the middle,
that's the nucleus here.
INA: Yes, I can focus through
to show you better.
That's what Boveri used to see
under the microscope.
ADAM: So this is an unfertilised egg.
You can really actually see
the sperm trying
to eat their way into the egg.
- INA: Yes.
- Oh, that's incredible. Wow!
You see the fertilisation envelope.
<i>Boveri knew
that when an egg is fertilised,</i>
<i>the nucleus of the egg and sperm
combine to form a new nucleus.</i>
<i>This first cell of the new embryo
divides into two.</i>
<i>Soon, two cells become four,
four cells become eight,</i>
<i>sixteen, thirty two and so on.</i>
<i>And each time a cell divides,
the nucleus of the new cell</i>
<i>inherits an identical copy
of all of the chromosomes.</i>
<i>So Boveri knew
the chromosomes must be important.</i>
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
<i>But how important?</i>
<i>He wondered,
if he added extra sperm into the egg,</i>
<i>would extra chromosomes appear?</i>
<i>What effect would this have?
Would the cells still divide normally?</i>
<i>With Ina's fluorescent microscope,
we can see what happens.</i>
<i>When extra sperm are added,</i>
<i>a whole process of cell division
goes off beam.</i>
<i>Clumps of deformed cells
of different shapes and sizes appear,</i>
<i>the whitish blobs in the middle
are the chromosomes in the nuclei.</i>
<i>But their irregular shape
suggests each nucleus</i>
<i>has acquired a different amount
of chromosomes.</i>
ADAM: So this one looks very different.
You got three nuclei here,
but is this one cell or two cells?
I can't, I can't quite make it out.
Yes, first of all, you can see
that there are three nuclei
and not two,
as supposed to be at this stage.
But also, what you can see is that
the nuclear content is different.
So you can see this is much bigger.
This is smaller. This is even smaller.
So this didn't receive
the same amount of chromosomes.
So there's different amounts
of chromosomes
in each bit of the cell
and so it's gone wrong.
INA: Exactly.
ADAM: And this embryo
won't develop any further than this.
Well, he will probably do
some more division,
but will generate monsters.
- A monster.
- Yeah.
So it won't develop
into a proper sea urchin.
Not at all.
<i>That's what Boveri saw.</i>
<i>Every time he introduced extra sperm
into his sea urchin eggs,</i>
<i>he got monsters,</i>
<i>mutant embryos that never
got further than a few cells.</i>
So let's just take a moment
to think about what a massive discovery
Boveri had made.
An embryo could only develop
if it had one full set of chromosomes
in every single cell.
So every time a cell divided,
a new identical set of chromosomes
had to be formed in every cell.
Any more or less,
and the embryo would die.
So it's suggested that
whatever information was contained
within the mysterious chromosomes,
it was essential for life.
<i>But what was that information?</i>
<i>Boveri had an idea.</i>
<i>The chromosomes for a new life
came from the sperm and the egg.</i>
<i>So could the chromosomes be the way</i>
<i>in which all the characteristics
of sea urchins are passed on</i>
<i>when a new life is created,</i>
<i>and again and again,
every time the cells divide?</i>
<i>Boveri spent the next 20 years
experimenting on sea urchins.</i>
<i>And he became convinced
that chromosomes must contain</i>
<i>what he called
"the hereditary characters".</i>
In other words, key bits of information
that control the characteristics
that a creature inherits.
Boveri was predicting
the existence of genes.
<i>He was onto something big.</i>
<i>The idea that chromosomes
within ourselves</i>
<i>could be the way that life and
all the traits we inherit are passed on.</i>
<i>In New York,
Boveri's work on chromosomes</i>
<i>had caught the attention
of a fellow embryologist.</i>
<i>Thomas Hunt Morgan was another veteran
of the Naples marine station.</i>
<i>But here at Columbia University,
he'd moved on from studying sea life.</i>
(FLIES BUZZING)
<i>His creature of choice
was Drosophila melanogaster.</i>
<i>That's the fruit fly to you and me.</i>
<i>Thanks to Morgan,</i>
<i>this tiny insect was to become
one of the mighty heroes of biology.</i>
<i>For anyone interested
in studying inheritance,</i>
<i>the fruit fly has some big advantages.</i>
<i>They're small, cheap
and they breed like... well, flies.</i>
<i>You can get a new generation
every 10 days.</i>
<i>And they only have four pairs
of chromosomes.</i>
<i>Morgan's lab became known
as the Fly Room.</i>
Now just as we inherit characteristics
from our parents,
so indeed do all creatures,
including fruit flies.
Morgan wanted to see
if he could see patterns of inheritance
in fruit flies and link those patterns
to the chromosomes.
Now, in nature,
fruit flies normally have red eyes.
But one day, Morgan found a male fly
with white eyes in his collection.
<i>He decided to crossbreed it
with a red-eyed female.</i>
(FLIES BUZZING)
<i>When Morgan bred their offspring</i>
<i>some of the next generation of flies
emerged with white eyes.</i>
<i>Morgan noticed
that it was only male flies</i>
<i>that had inherited white eyes,
none of the females.</i>
<i>He concluded that having white eyes
was somehow linked to being male.</i>
<i>Morgan knew that the chromosomes
of fruit flies</i>
<i>included two which determine gender.</i>
<i>So he deduced that the information
for making white eyes</i>
<i>had to be carried
on the sex chromosomes.</i>
<i>That was his breakthrough.</i>
Morgan had now found evidence
that seemed to support
what Boveri had predicted,
that the characteristics we inherit
map to specific parts of the chromosome.
<i>Now the Fly Room was really buzzing.</i>
<i>Morgan and his team,
were soon able to find</i>
<i>which parts of the fly's chromosomes
accounted for traits like body colour</i>
<i>and wing size, as well as eye colour.</i>
(BUZZING)
<i>And by 1922, they'd drawn up
the world's first chromosome map</i>
<i>showing the location
of 2,000 different traits.</i>
<i>To describe the individual parts of the
chromosomes that related to each trait,</i>
<i>he used the word "gene".</i>
Nowadays, genes are part
of our everyday language.
So it's easy to forget
what a huge leap forward this was.
To understand that the way we look
and the way we operate
might be determined by genes
within ourselves.
(LAUGHING)
<i>Genes are what families truly share.</i>
<i>They are the biological link
between my dad, myself and my son.</i>
(TODDLER LAUGHING)
<i>Spotting those genetic connections
can make family photo albums such fun.</i>
That's you.
See that does... that looks
like Jakey to me.
Yes. Very, very similar.
ADAM: You look much more like your mum.
Yeah, I always did. Yeah, where is she?
<i>Back in the 1920s, the idea
that something within ourselves</i>
<i>could account
for family resemblance was new.</i>
ADAM: Look at that,
look at those tiger-skin Speedo's.
That is an awesome pose,
but the thing is,
that you were on the other side
of the camera, probably encouraging me
- to do something stupid.
- Possibly. Very likely, very likely.
<i>Today, these genetic links are accepted.</i>
<i>But a century ago,
this was ground-breaking stuff.</i>
<i>Scientists had peered into
the cell nucleus,</i>
<i>they had found chromosomes.</i>
<i>And they had shown
that these chromosomes</i>
<i>carried information we inherit, genes.</i>
<i>But they still had no idea how.</i>
So here was the new question,
what on earth were genes?
What was the chemistry within cells,
the molecule,
that allowed hereditary information
to pass from one cell to another,
from generation to generation?
<i>The answer to that
would come from two scientists,</i>
<i>studying not inheritance, but disease.</i>
<i>Fred Griffith and Oswald Avery
were both medical researchers</i>
<i>working on pneumonia,
but on opposite sides of the Atlantic.</i>
<i>They didn't even know each other,
but together,</i>
<i>they would find the next crucial piece
of the puzzle of how cells work.</i>
Fred Griffith was working at the
Ministry of Health, here in London.
He was investigating types of bacteria.
Single cells that invade the body
and reproduce there.
He wants to find out why some
bacteria kill and others don't.
And he stumbled across something
rather remarkable.
(SQUEAKING)
<i>It all began when he was using
laboratory mice to test cocktails</i>
<i>of different bacterial strains.</i>
(MIMICKING SQUEAK)
<i>He was looking for a combination
that would work as a vaccine</i>
<i>to prevent pneumonia.</i>
<i>He started with solutions of two
different types of pneumonia bacteria,</i>
<i>which I've mocked up in these beakers.
One harmless, the other lethal.</i>
Here, little fella.
<i>And with very basic equipment,
he tested his bacteria on the mice.</i>
Unsurprisingly, when he injected
the mice with a harmless bacteria,
they were fine.
And when he injected them
with the lethal bacteria, they died.
<i>Griffith then took the solution of
lethal pneumonia bacteria and heated it.</i>
<i>He thought this
should kill the bacteria.</i>
<i>And sure enough, when injected,
the mice showed no sign of pneumonia.</i>
<i>It was then
that Griffith tried something</i>
<i>which gave a very surprising result.</i>
When Griffith made a mixture
of the lethal, heat-treated bacteria,
with the harmless bacteria...
Remember that neither of these
had killed the mice on their own.
He found that some of the mice died.
When he examined the dead mice,
he found deadly bacteria in their blood.
Something very spooky was going on here.
<i>Griffith figured that something
in the lethal bacteria had survived.</i>
<i>And whatever it was, it had transformed
the harmless bacteria into killer cells.</i>
<i>But what was that something?
He never found out.</i>
Griffith had his job to do,
working on vaccines.
He never realised
that he'd accidentally found
a whopping great clue to what genes are.
A clue that would lead
to a major breakthrough
in our understanding of how cells work.
<i>But his results caught the attention
of Oswald Avery,</i>
<i>also an expert in pneumonia bacteria.</i>
Avery was determined to find out
what it was that had the power
to change one type of cell into another?
It would take him nearly a decade,
but it would turn out to be
a critically important discovery.
<i>At the Rockefeller Institute
in New York,</i>
<i>Avery and his team were using
the latest methods in biochemistry</i>
<i>to look inside bacteria.</i>
<i>They knew that bacteria, like all cells,
are essentially little bags</i>
<i>jammed full of different kinds
of molecules.</i>
<i>A chemical soup made of millions
of protein molecules, carbohydrates</i>
<i>and fatty substances called lipids.</i>
<i>Over nine years,
they tested every type of molecule</i>
<i>in the lethal pneumonia bacteria,
to find out which molecule</i>
<i>was passing on its deadly traits
to the harmless bacteria.</i>
Avery decided to work
by a process of elimination.
First, he removed the carbohydrates
and then the lipids,
but it wasn't either of them.
Then he removed all of the proteins,
but it wasn't them either.
Finally, he turned his attention
to a molecule that had seemed
like an unlikely candidate.
<i>It was when he started testing DNA,
the strange molecule in the nucleus</i>
<i>that Friedrich Miescher had found
75 years earlier,</i>
<i>that Avery got a result.</i>
<i>Stripped of their DNA,
the power of the lethal bacteria</i>
<i>to transform other cells
simply vanished.</i>
<i>What Avery had discovered,
was the molecule that genes are made of.</i>
This was a huge discovery.
It showed that DNA
was actually controlling cells.
In order to understand how cells work
and, indeed, how life works,
we would first need to understand DNA.
It became crucial to know exactly
what it is and what it's for.
<i>By the late 1940s,
the chemistry of the cell,</i>
<i>was starting to become clearer.</i>
<i>What once had appeared to be
indistinct blobs,</i>
<i>were now known to contain chromosomes.</i>
<i>These were shown to carry genes.</i>
<i>And now they'd discovered that
all genes were made of DNA.</i>
<i>But how did DNA control cells?</i>
<i>Scientists thought that they
might find the answer</i>
<i>in the structure of the molecule.</i>
<i>They needed to work out
how DNA was built?</i>
<i>And this quest would turn out to be
the most famous story in biology.</i>
<i>It was after the Second World War
that the quest began in earnest.</i>
<i>The American Nuclear Weapons project
had involved thousands of physicists</i>
<i>who delved deep into the atoms
at the heart of all matter.</i>
<i>Among them, was a British scientist
who returned home after the war</i>
<i>to take a job
at King's College in London.</i>
<i>As part of its post-war
rebuilding programme,</i>
<i>the college had acquired the latest
X- ray imaging techniques</i>
<i>to look deep within the cell.</i>
<i>And Professor Maurice Wilkins
was put in charge.</i>
Now here is one of the X-ray generators
we're using in this work.
(GENERATOR WHIRRING)
We use X-rays to study
the structure of a molecule,
because an X-ray travels along
like this, in a wavy kind of way.
And the lengths of the waves,
of the X-rays,
are about equal to the distance
between the atoms in a molecule.
So when an X-ray strikes the molecule,
the waves of the X-rays
can squeeze in between the atoms,
and, when they come out the other side,
their directions are deviated.
And from the deviation of the X-rays,
we can work out
the way in which the atoms
are arranged inside the molecule.
The X-rays taken here at King's College,
were pivotal.
Producing them would be
a painstaking job
by a brilliant young scientist
working with Wilkins,
and her name was Rosalind Franklin.
<i>Franklin was an expert in X-ray imaging.</i>
<i>With her expertise,</i>
<i>the college hoped to be the first
to find the structure of DNA.</i>
<i>She worked in a new laboratory
built in the basement,</i>
<i>on the rubble of the old college
which had been bombed.</i>
The college authorities were concerned
that the X-ray experiments,
which used hydrogen, could be dangerous.
So they made Franklin and her assistant
do their work at night time,
after the students had gone home.
<i>Franklin used highly concentrated DNA.</i>
(BUBBLING)
<i>One of her skills was in finding
just the right amount of moisture</i>
<i>to prepare the strands.</i>
<i>It was precision work.</i>
<i>When she stretched out its fibres,
she got a single DNA strand,</i>
<i>a tenth of a millimetre across.</i>
Here in the lab, she took strands
of DNA and mounted them inside
this specially-built camera.
The camera chamber was filled with
hydrogen to get the very best image.
When the X-rays are switched on,
they shone through the DNA
and scattered in different directions,
creating an image
on a photographic film.
<i>Franklin took over 100 pictures.</i>
<i>Each one could take up to 90 hours
of exposure at close range.</i>
<i>Once the photo was processed,
she projected it onto the wall,</i>
<i>so she could calculate
the exact distance between atoms.</i>
It was picture 51 that showed the best
image of the mysterious DNA molecule.
<i>This distinctive "X"shape was the key
that would reveal how DNA is built.</i>
<i>But it was not Franklin's name
that came to be associated</i>
<i>with the discovery of DNA's structure.</i>
<i>Wilkins was in close touch
with scientists from Cambridge,</i>
<i>who were anxious to find the structure
of DNA before American rivals.</i>
<i>Unknown to Franklin,
Wilkins gave photo 51 to James Watson,</i>
<i>an ambitious young scientist
at Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory.</i>
<i>Having studied the photo,
Watson and his collaborator,</i>
<i>Francis Crick, had a sudden revelation.</i>
<i>It would transform them
into scientific celebrities</i>
<i>and put the cell
at the centre of world attention.</i>
This is the Eagle pub here in Cambridge.
According to Watson,
on February the 28th, 1953,
Francis Crick strolled into this pub
and announced to fellow drinkers,
"We have found the secret of life."
Now, if you ask me,
this story is a little bit apocryphal.
Probably embellished
with some dramatic licence.
Nevertheless, the sentiment is bang on
and shouldn't be understated.
This marks one of the truly great
moments in the history of science.
<i>Crick and Watson had worked out
the structure of DNA.</i>
<i>And very soon, their double helix model
was announced to the world.</i>
<i>The structure of DNA is now the most
famous image in all biology.</i>
What Crick and Watson showed,
is that it's made of two long strands
intertwined into two spirals.
With sugar and phosphate,
making up the backbone.
But it's on the inside of the spiral
where things get really interesting.
<i>On the inside, are four molecules,
adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine.</i>
<i>Their better known by their letters,
"A", "T", "C"and "G".</i>
<i>They're called "bases."</i>
What Crick and Watson discovered,
is that these four basic units,
pair up millions of times
within the double helix.
And they pair up in a very specific way.
<i>"A"always pairs with "T".</i>
<i>And "C"always pairs with "G".</i>
<i>"A"and "T"and "C"and "G",
making up the rungs of the ladder,</i>
<i>within the double helix.</i>
What Crick and Watson realised,
is if you split the two strands
of the DNA apart,
you have all the information to make
two new fresh pieces of DNA.
Every time you have an "A",
it pairs up with a "T".
Every time you have a "C",
it pairs up with a "G".
So when you split them apart,
you can replace the missing strand
and make up a new double helix, twice.
Genius.
<i>Crick and Watson's discovery triggered
an explosion in scientific research.</i>
<i>DNA's structure had revealed the secret
of how genes are reproduced</i>
<i>every time a cell divides.</i>
<i>An identical copy of the DNA
is passed on from cell to cell.</i>
<i>Incredibly, all the information
needed to create life,</i>
<i>is encoded in this molecule.</i>
<i>So the next big challenge
was to crack the code.</i>
<i>Within 10 years,</i>
<i>scientists had deciphered the code
within the double helix.</i>
<i>It was the instructions to make
the millions of molecules</i>
<i>that build ourselves.</i>
<i>By then scientists used
electron microscopes to see</i>
<i>the complex machinery inside the cell.</i>
The electron microscope is an instrument
capable of enlarging, of magnifying
of the order of 100,000 times.
HORN: Now can we move
towards the nucleus?
That's fine.
From such minute studies,
it is possible to make models such as
the one which is the star of our set.
The half section of a cell
with the outer skin removed,
one million times larger than life.
Professor Swann,
perhaps you can orientate us
now that we are inside the cell,
to what Mr Horn was showing us
on the electron microscope.
Well, I think
the first thing to get clear,
is that you can see very clearly
this great tracery of tubes and twigs.
That is the reticulum.
And in the middle,
of course, the nucleus.
<i>Today's computer graphics
show how much more we now know</i>
<i>about how the cell works.</i>
<i>Cells use complex machinery
to carry out the DNA's instructions,</i>
<i>and to make the millions of molecules
that keep cells and us alive.</i>
<i>These are the cells
that all living beings are made of.</i>
<i>All of it designed
and controlled by DNA.</i>
<i>And to make a living organism
takes a staggering amount of DNA.</i>
<i>Each human cell
has 3.4 billion letters of DNA code.</i>
<i>To print them on paper,
has taken 120 volumes.</i>
<i>But there's a conundrum here.</i>
If you take any single cell in my body,
whether it's brain or bone or skin,
they contain the same instructions,
the same DNA and the same genes.
So how do you get from this
set of instructions
to a fully functional human,
containing trillions
of highly-specialised cells?
Let me show you what I mean.
I'm gonna damage my skin
by giving myself a burn.
Now you should not do this at home.
I'm doing it purely
in the interest of science.
The burn is gonna destroy some
of my skin cells and create a wound.
So here goes.
(GROANING)
(CHUCKLING) Oh, my goodness, that hurt!
Now you can see, it's already started
to burn the top layer of skin there.
Now we take it for granted that this
wound is gonna heal, thankfully for me.
But if you think about it,
it's a really remarkable process.
And it can only happen
because lots of different types of cells
get to work to perform
highly-specialised functions.
That really hurt!
That really hurt quite a lot.
<i>Over the next days and weeks,
my wound mends itself.</i>
<i>Nerve cells register pain and damage.</i>
<i>White blood cells fight infection.</i>
<i>Red blood cells form the scab.</i>
<i>And crucially, new cells develop
and grow and make up layers</i>
<i>of young tissue
that replace the dead skin cells.</i>
<i>And here's the rub.</i>
<i>Remember, all the cells in my body
share exactly the same DNA, my DNA.</i>
<i>Yet, somehow, all the different kinds
of cells involved in healing my wound,</i>
<i>know exactly what they should be doing.</i>
Four weeks later,
my skin is well on its way to healing,
although I am going to have a scar.
This process has happened
because all of the cells involved
knew exactly what their function was.
But how did they know that?
How do any cells know what to do
and what they are for?
<i>This question continued
to puzzle scientists long after</i>
<i>they'd discovered the structure of DNA.</i>
<i>How could the same DNA
make different kinds of cells?</i>
<i>The answers would come from some of the
freakiest experiments in all biology.</i>
<i>And they would reveal
something astonishing</i>
<i>about the origins of life itself.</i>
It was here in Switzerland,
some 30 years after Crick and Watson,
that the first clue was discovered.
And yet again, it came from a scientist
studying, our old friend, the fruit fly.
(BUZZING)
<i>Professor Walter Gehring
is a pioneer of modern biology.</i>
<i>In the 1980s,
his work helped solve the mystery</i>
<i>that remained at the heart of all life.</i>
<i>How can DNA make all the different types
of cell needed to build a living being?</i>
<i>Gehring's breakthrough began
with something that happens</i>
<i>very occasionally in nature.</i>
<i>A mutant fruit fly
born with a rare abnormality.</i>
<i>A perfectly formed leg
growing out of its head,</i>
<i>right where the antenna should be.</i>
<i>The wrong kind of cells
in the wrong part of the body.</i>
<i>Spooky.</i>
<i>By comparing the genes
of this mutant with normal flies,</i>
<i>Gehring had been able
to isolate the gene</i>
<i>that triggers the growth
of a fly's leg.</i>
<i>Did this gene have anything in common
with the genes that controlled</i>
<i>other parts of the fly's body?</i>
<i>Gehring and his team got to work</i>
<i>analysing and comparing
the DNA sequences.</i>
So, what you can do is,
you split this molecule.
You chop it into tiny fragments.
You have to find out where your gene is.
(INAUDIBLE)
<i>After months of work, they found
the location on the chromosome</i>
<i>of several very similar genes.</i>
What we did was to make a huge...
what we call a restriction map,
and here we have
the individual pieces of DNA.
This is the actual data
that you produced in...
This is the handmade map which we made
to map each one of these.
But this is actually
a piece of history though.
This is the historical piece, yes.
<i>The finished map
produced a stunning revelation.</i>
WALTER: See, it's these red things.
<i>It showed that all the key parts
of the fly's body</i>
<i>had something in common.</i>
<i>They were controlled by a handful
of identical genetic switches.</i>
<i>These switches turned on other genes
in the developing embryo.</i>
<i>And each of these genetic switches</i>
<i>controlled one major chunk
of the fly's body.</i>
It's been a while since I've done this.
(WHIRRING)
- But take out the...
- Oh, I need to take out the stopper.
(LAUGHING)
Good call.
All right, I'll try that again.
<i>With the help of the mutant,
Gehring's team had begun to solve</i>
<i>the mystery of how all the different
types of cell in the fly's body</i>
<i>grow in the right place
and at the right time.</i>
Aw! I miss doing this.
<i>These genetic switches,
they're called homeobox genes,</i>
<i>control when other genes
are switched on.</i>
<i>As the fly larva grows, they kick in
and lay out the fly's body plan.</i>
<i>Head at one end, tail at the other.</i>
<i>And they start a chain reaction
of other genes,</i>
<i>to grow a leg, a wing, or an antenna
in exactly the right place.</i>
<i>Now scientists wanted to know,</i>
<i>did other creatures have similar
genetic switches?</i>
<i>They began to study other species.
Everything from frogs to mice to humans.</i>
<i>Species which looked very different.</i>
(SQUEAKING)
<i>And in every species they looked at,</i>
<i>they found exactly
the same genetic switches.</i>
<i>The mechanism was the same
in wildly different animals.</i>
(CROAKING)
<i>It was a staggering result.</i>
<i>But the biggest revelation
was still to come.</i>
(BUZZING)
<i>In 1995, a student of Gehring's
found the gene in a fruit fly</i>
<i>which triggers the formation of eyes.</i>
<i>This gene launches a cascade
of 2,000 other genes</i>
<i>that generate all the cells
that make up a fly's eye.</i>
<i>This eye gene in the fly
looked incredibly similar</i>
<i>to the gene that triggers eyes
in mammals.</i>
Now here's where it gets
really interesting.
Gehring knew that the same gene
existed in mice and humans,
species whose eyes
are completely different to fly eyes.
But a bold idea had taken hold
in his mind and he decided to test it
with a bizarre experiment.
<i>He took the mouse eye gene
and he put it into a fruit fly embryo.</i>
<i>Dimitri Papadopoulos is showing me</i>
<i>how to insert the gene
into the fertilised egg.</i>
Okay, so you've got DNA
inside the needle
and you're injecting it
straight into the embryo?
Yes, exactly. We inject
the posterior part of the eggs.
RUTHERFORD: Yeah, that's in.
PAPADOPOULOS: Yeah.
RUTHERFORD: So that's it?
<i>Nobody knew what would happen.
Would it kill the developing fly?</i>
<i>Would it try to make
a whole mouse eye in the fly?</i>
<i>The result was striking.</i>
The eyes are bright red,
so you cannot be mistaken
if you see something red here,
it's an additional eye.
And they have lots of them.
It's just incredible to look at.
It's got eyes all over its body.
<i>The eyes grew in several places,
because scientists had no way</i>
<i>of controlling exactly where
the mouse DNA would end up.</i>
<i>But the baffling thing is,</i>
<i>they're not mouse eyes,
they're fly eyes.</i>
<i>The fly cells have been able to read the
mouse gene as though it was their own.</i>
I can see its normal eye, but I can
also see maybe eight other eyes.
Including one,
right on the end of its antenna,
which is flicking around. It's...
- GEHRING: Moving around, yeah?
- Yeah.
GEHRING: That's quite interesting.
It's like a sensor which moves.
A video camera
which moves around and searches.
What we have shown
for these antennal eyes,
is that they can see with these eyes.
- They can actually see with these eyes?
- They can see. Yeah.
<i>Gehring's mutants made headlines
around the world.</i>
<i>We came on the front page of
The New York Times,</i>
and they said,
"Science outdoes Hollywood."
<i>It was the time of Spielberg
and Jurassic Park.</i>
And so very wild things
were shown on screen,
but the journalists thought that science
even outdoes Hollywood at that time.
Well, I completely agree with that.
You look at these things
and it's much more impressive.
<i>But the headlines missed the real
significance of Gehring's results.</i>
<i>If genetic switches
are shared across all species,</i>
<i>everything from fruit flies to humans,</i>
<i>and if genes can be swapped
between species,</i>
<i>this suggested that all life must've
descended from one common ancestor,</i>
<i>just as Charles Darwin predicted.</i>
The fact that you used
a mouse gene to do that,
what does that say about
the way our DNA is shared?
Yeah, it shows that we all
are related to one another.
That Darwin was right.
That we all share a common descent.
<i>So the story of the cell</i>
<i>is the story of the evolution
of life itself.</i>
<i>150 years of brilliant science
had brought us to this point.</i>
<i>At the heart of all life,
is one extraordinary molecule, DNA.</i>
<i>A molecule that holds
all the information to make</i>
<i>every kind of cell
that has ever existed.</i>
<i>Understanding the chemistry of life,
has brought us to the cusp</i>
<i>of one of the most exciting
scientific experiments of all time.</i>
Now that we know how cells work
and how genes work within cells,
scientists are about to be able
to build new cells from scratch,
to have them do our bidding.
We are on the brink of doing something
that has only happened once
in the last four billion years,
to create new life
from its component parts.
And to do that, we need to go back
to the very beginning of life on Earth,
to find out how
the first cell came about.
<i>In the final programme,
I'll reveal how scientists are close</i>
<i>to recreating
that first cell in the lab.</i>
<i>How they found answers in the toxic
chemistry of the early Earth</i>
<i>and in meteorites from space.</i>
(EXPLOSION)
<i>And I'll show how unlocking
the power of the cell,</i>
<i>will transform all our lives.</i>
