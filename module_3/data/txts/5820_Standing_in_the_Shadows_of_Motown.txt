It was bigger than we
thought it was gonna be.
We didn't know it was
gonna be that big!
To be or not to be,
it was being.
At first we didn't notice
what was going on..
We were too busy, creating
the music and the magic..
you know that.. you have..
played 'em hit records,
and the jukeboxes and
the radios playing
and somebody say, "Oh, boy, that's
Motown", but they never know us.
Nobody never mentioned too
much about us, you know..
Really a long time, it goes
and finally it gets to you.
Finaly, when the dust
cleared, it was all over.
And we realized, we were
being left out of the dream.
It's the end!
And.. as the years
go by, we wonder
will anyone ever know, who
we are and what we did.

innocence, of "Father knows best".
Lady Day passed on and Fats
Domino enticed the nation

Elvis Presley burst out of
Mississippi like a tornado,
gathering followers from every

There was a cultural tidal

Radio stations flooded the country
with this new sound from the South.
But the roots of that music, the
originators remained unknown.
These pioneers of R&B, could be found
in the far reaches of the radio dial,
playing soulfully for
their loyal fans.
But they were confined to frustration,
as they watched their white counterparts
triumph, with the style

tracks, it really..
- no offence to any of the great
artists that sang on them, but
anybody could've sung
on them. You can add (...)
singing on some of the stuff,
it would've been a hit,
because the tracks were
just so incredible...
they were musical entities
on to themselves.
They had a natural filthy music, you
know, they were just that exceptional.
Being really good jazz musicians,
they could swing like crazy,
and that's something that's not
always present in pop music.
The bass drum had a note. It wasn't a dead
pfff... It was the boom, so you had boom...
When there's a groove like that, the
subliminal effect is everybody feels good.
They were the groundwork. They were the
things, that everything else was built on.
It was like a river.
Constantly flowing.
Talent, creations, you know,
people coming, you know..
Who's available,
who's on the list?
Well, call him in. Where are they?
Are they out of town?
This one's out of town.
Well, call the other one.

Always the Funk Brothers..
First!
Without them, there really
wouldn't be a Μotown.
That was the sound, that
was the foundation.
That was the essence of Μotown.
That essence was an
overpowering line-up of
veteran groove masters and
trailblazing virtuosos.
Guitarists Eddie Willis,
Joe Messina and Robert White.
And keyboardists Johnny Griffith,
Joe Hunter and Earl Van Dyke,
wove an irresistible tapestry of
instrumental hooks and counter rhythms,
over the electrifying core
of the Motown groove.
A core comprised
of James Jamerson,

After World War II, the

turned Detroit into
an economic magnet
for people in search
of steady work.
Tens of thousands
migrated to the city.
Among them, several
future Funk Brothers.
Actually, Jamerson came
from South Carolina,
Eddie Willis came
from Mississippi,
Pistol came from Memphis, Tennessee
and I'm from Jackson, Tennessee.
We came north, mostly
our people came north,
to get jobs in the car factories
here in Detroit, Michigan.

of 8 Mile Road and Livernois,</font></i>
<i><font color="#ff8000">has been a Detroit jazz
institution for over 50 years.</font></i>
Berry showed up down at
Little Sam's one time and
he walked over by the bandstand,
while we were playing
and he said to me, "Would you
have time to talk to me?"
I says, "I got more
time than money!"
and he explained to
me what he was about.
He wanted to set up
a record company and..
he needed good musicians.
I thought it was
a wonderful idea
and wanted to know, did I know
anybody to fill the thing.
He already knew Mr Benjamin,
Benny Benjamin "Papa Zita".
So, actually he called the first
rehearsal over to
Claudette's house,
Smokey Robinson's
wife at that time.
That was late '58.
And then Papa Ζita was already
there and I was there.
We eventually found the great
James Jamerson on bass.
I remember my dad saying as a
child growing up, that he would take
a stick and take a rubber band, and
put one part of the rubber band
at one end and the other
part at the other,
and stick it in an ant hole.
And make the ants dance!
When he was a kid on Edisto Island,
James and his friends would slip
through a window into their
little, two-room school house,
they'd light a fire and play the
piano, until class started.
After school, they'd
continue making music
in a neighbour's
vacant summer home,
where there just happened to be
an old piano and an upright bass.
But the most important pointer
that my father taught me
ah, when I'm playing, if I
don't feel it, don't play it.
And you know, a lot of guys
would just play straight...♪
there were no feeling, but
he would play it like...♪
you know, put something
in it. He just felt
life, you know,
that life was music.
And he used to tell this story like..
this one song he did,
he saw a fat woman
walking down the street
and her butt going
boom da-boom...
And that was his interpretation
of music, sort of..
He put music to, just about in
anything that had life to it.
There's an indentment
right here in the bass,
where he kept his thumb,
right here, as a rest.
That's how old this bass is.
So you can see all
the dirt on here.
As he used to say, the
dirt keeps the funk!
This has been the original bass
ever since he started playing,
before he switched
over to Precision.
He used this on Heat Wave,
My Guy, Shop Around,
most of the Mary
Wells stuff,
You Beat Me To The Punch, some
other earlier stuff with Stevie.
And he played with one finger on
all those hits, just like this,..
the finger was called "the hook"
and it would hook like this
and all the songs that you heard,
basically was done with one finger.
I have trouble playing with two
fingers, the line that he played, so!
You couldn't even
touch his timing,
because he could hear
another time in his head
and be playing cut-time against what
you're playing. And it would fit!
There was never a bass
player, on no coast end
there was West Coast, East Coast,
whatever coast you wanna call it,
that was comparable
to a James Jamerson.
It's the height of creativity, you know
and freedom and experimentation
and fearlessness. You have to
be absolutely fearless to play
those notes in that place and...
and yet be responsible for your, for
the bottom of the groove like that.
I thought bass playing was
played like that all the time,
but little did I know that it was my
father changing the course of bass.
Soon about 1960, Berry bought a
house on West Grand Boulevard.
This house had a garage,
with a dirt floor.
Walk down the four, time-worn,
wooden steps into the basement
of 2648, West Grand Blvd. and
you enter a fantasy land.
A tiny, dimly-lit room,
with smoke stained walls,
where dreams came true
for Motown's young stars.
A place where timeless classics
like I Can't Help Myself,
Shop Around and Where did
our love go, were born.
This is Hitsville USA, the
home of the Motown sound.
But to the musicians who worked
there, it was just Studio A,
affectionately referred
to as: The Snakepit!
It was the site of countless,
steamy, 4 A.M. sessions,
where monster hits were cranked
out, in an hour or less.
A place where deadly grooves
threatened to set the walls on fire!
This was the home of Motown's
studio band, the Funk Brothers.
- Smokey was the main one
that would pull this off.
He'd dream of a song. He'd come
in the studio with something
written down, maybe 2 bars or
2 verses of it all on paper.
It's basically, "Hey man, I got a tune.
What do you think of this?"
And he'd play it, next thing you know, Joe would
say, "Well, this is what you're trying to play."
And he'd give him the chords and
full structure, next thing you know
"Hey, hey, come, come here James."
And he'd make James play this line,
and in a minute you'd have a song.
That's how the studio was
<i>every</i> day. And they'd
fight to get in Studio A.
This is the first time we've
been in here to play,
since the '70s. Lot of
these people come here
for the first time. They have
no idea what's in here.
Because, along with our creativity,
was Berry's prayers in here,
that we will be successful
in what we were doing,
to make those hits.
And then we used to hear it in <i>his</i> voice.
We used to hear the way he used to
talk to us, we used to hear the
artists, how they would talk to us.
Lot of prayers where
in this building.
Wasn't it Joe?
- Yeah. True.
You have no idea the gravity
of what went on, emotionally.
I swear to God, when I
went in there tonight,
I get this feeling, I
can almost touch it.
It never left that room.
- Yeah, it's a strange feeling.
- It never left that room.
It's in there.

I was playing up in Boston,
Massachussets, when
I ran into Marvin Gaye.
I didn't know who he was and
someone from his entourage said,
"I want you to meet
a famous singer."
I said, OK. And he said,
"His name is Marvin Gaye."
So, I didn't realize Marvin
was standing with the guy,
I didn't know who he was, so, he said,
"Have you ever heard of Marvin Gaye?"
I said, "Nah.. never heard of him. If
he don't play jazz, I don't know him."
I was kinda cocky, 'cos all
jazz musicians were cocky.
Everybody wanted to
be like Miles Davis,
...no matter what
instruments you played.
So I talked with Marvin and he was telling
me about, he was starting a band,
and would I like to come to
Detroit. So, no musician
turns down a good gig.
So I said I'd come.
- Was this like a.. garage area or?
- Garage. Yeah, it was a dirt floor.
from the beginning. They had a
piece of plywood in this area
with the piano
sitting, right there.
And the walls had.. carpeting..
cinder block. - Yeah.
- And the entrance was
right about there.
You know, not being a bass player, not being
a guitar player, not being a drummer,
arrangers would come in and
just have a general idea of..
or concept, and would leave
it up to the masters.
We were allowed 4 songs
in a 3 hour session.
And we were to get
no less than 2.
But that's because the same guys
played together all the time.
So, I mean, the only thing
that changed was the changes.
And, it was like a home then,
we spent so much time there.
It was always usually Jamerson
kicking something off..
and everybody falling
in, either Benny.
Benny kicked something off,
Jamerson had something
to throw in, that fitted. And,
then everybody could come in.
<i>Back then, you guys would have
to do the tune, all in one take.</i>
- Yes. - Yeah, oh yeah.
- From beginning to end. Yes.
- In the earlier days they only
had 3 tracks to work with.
- I think it was a great school for mixing,
because you had to learn how to
mix, 'cos you had one shot at it.
- You only had one shot at it
and you had to get it right the first time.
- That's right.
We felt as it was our job to really
lay the groundwork for these kids,
to have as a place to really develop
their careers in singing,
because we had the experience. They had
the talent, we had the experience.
- They were really young, right?
- Oh, they were very young,
most of the producers were young.
In fact, all of the producers
were young.
There was a bunch of fellas standing
around, drinking a little wine,
called "The Contours".
And we was up there doing
a funny band track,
something I'd never
heard before, you know,
and had the charts out..
we start playing, you know..
start playing the charts, when
the director came up there.
And after we finished, I say
"That will <i>never</i> be a hit".
And the Contours walked up

In the early days of Motown, the Funk
Brothers played on some big hits like:
The Miracles - Shop Around,
The Marvelettes - Please Mr Postman
and Mary Wells - You
Beat Me To The Punch.
But still, there was not
enough recording work
down in the Snakepit
to make a living.
So in 1961, James Jamerson, Joe Hunter
and a few of the other band members
left to go on the road
with Jackie Wilson.
But Wilson was recovering from a gunshot
wound and didn't have the strength
to perform more than
once or twice a week.
Realizing their new
situation was worse,
they returned home to Motown, where Berry
Gordy welcomed them back with open arms.
But their touring days
were not yet over...
- Like in the early 60s, you went out
with the Marvelettes, - Right.
- I went out with Marvin, you know,
and Stevie Wonder - Yeah.
and then we did gigs, maybe, you know,
200 miles outside Detroit, occasionally.
- That weren't nothing. - Yeah, Joe.
- The first really big tour was
the 1962, - Yeah. - Motown Revue. - Right.
- Where we had 31 nighters and New England,
and then the South, and
then 10 days at the Apollo.
- Oh, man. That's a long streak.

In all that was the 3 of us.

We were on the road, you know and
coming back from up North, on a gig..
- Yeah. - And.. everyone was packed in
the car, half sleeping, everything..
and you know, as I think back on that,
Marvin Gaye was the drummer on that gig,
wasn't it?
- Yeah.. that was ridiculous.
- I think he was a better singer, though.
- You know, that's right.
- And they had us in this big
old station-wagon. - Right.
- It was about 2 o' clock in the morning.
- Right. - And it was freezing.
- And Jamerson in the car with us.
- Ain't that something. - Damn...
- And about 10 degrees outside, we
were coming down the mountain side.
We were all dozing off, we told
all the jokes we could think of.
And Jamerson says, "Can
you pull the car over?
Robert, can you
pull the car over?"
<i>What you doing, man? Hurry
up, man, it's cold outside.</i>
So he pulls over to the side of the road,
goes back there to get to the trunk,
pulls his brown paper-bag out.
Jumps back in the car, he decides to put
his pyjamas on, in the back of the car.
<i>- In order for me to go to
sleep, I got to put my pj's on.</i>
He's bumping people on the sides
and slamming people's heads...
And everybody's
complaining now..
Everybody settles back down, 'cos we
knew about being around Jamerson,
you try to keep him as
tranquil as possible,
because he could
really get out there.
Then all of a sudden,
that bag rustles again.
<i>- Oh, man...
- Oh my God, he got pigs feet..</i>
Smelled like someone kicked the
dog on a skunk on the behind.
Everybody really got ticked
about that, 'cos it was.. rancid!
So man, we raised so much Cain in that
end, you know, he says, OK, OK...
<i>- All right, all right, I might put the top
back on. I might! - Come on, man.</i>
<i>- That stuff stinks, man. - Just because,
you know, just to keep the peace.</i>
So he put the lid back on.
So he's sitting back.
Everybody's kinda
dozing again.
And we see a light, light in
the back. Somebody lit a match.
It's Jamerson!
He lights his funky,
smokey cigar.
<i>- Hey, Rob.
- That's it! Man, pull the car over.</i>
They say, hey man, pull the car.
We're putting him out.
So sure enough, Robert pulls
over to the side. Out goes James,
with his funky pig's feet,
his pyjamas and his cigar.
<i>♪ The way you smell so sweet, you know,
you could've been some perfume... ♪</i>
- That's right. And
as Jamerson faded, we
thought about it. We had
to run over his butt!
Benny played with Dizzy,
Charlie Parker, Ray Charles,
Lowell Fulson, Muddy Waters,
Jimmy Reed, Chuck Berry..
Benny played with the
best was out there.
He was the main, standard drummer
and I was the pianist at that time.
And before Earl got there. Anyway,
we liked to frequent the corn
liquor places. He had a
taste for corn liquor.
So this day we went and, we
hadn't had too much sleep.
And Benny was up there, they was
doing a tune called "Hitch-hike",
by Marvin Gaye. They kicked off
the tune and Benny was nodding
and dropped his sticks.
So, the A&R men went up there
and smelled his breath.
He said "Benny, I said
you've been drinking.
Benny!" He picked up the
sticks real quick and he
said "Papa-zita,
papa-zita, papa-zita"
So after that, everybody in the studio
started calling him Papa Zita.
He come in the studio one time
late and he told Berry, said
"Man, I was on my own, on the
freeway, on my way here,
say, the traffic got tied up, 'cos
a circus had just come into town,
and the truck had an accident and
the elephants got out of the truck
and got loose and was
holding up the traffic.
And everybody knew he was lying, 'cos -
guess what - Benny didn't even drive!
First of all, Benny was a
master at locking the tempo.
He's like a, like a metronome.
He would lock it, see.
And then he had certain kinds of
pick-ups, which were only unique to him.
For instance, a Benny Benjamin
pick-up would go like this...
like that... you know...
That's different. OK?
Uriel Jones would play, you know...
Then, if I would play it 4 bars or
something like that, I'd play...
All three of those pick-ups
came from Papa Zita,
Benny Benjamin, you know,
he originated them.
- I'm really curious as to how you all
got the name "The Funk Brothers"?
- Look here, one day when
Benny got ready to leave,
he walked up them steps and Benny said,
"You all are the Funk Brothers".

I was working in a club and
first Mickey Stevenson came by.
And then he told me, how would I
like to be a studio musician.
I said, "Well, what is that?", he said,
"Well, come by the studio and
listen to what Joe is doing and work
from that point." I said, "OK, fine".
So, I went by there and
Joe was doing this
record, was Pride & Joy,
or something like that.
So I sit and I say, "What
the hell are you doing?"
You know, 'cos we never
played to nobody singing,
and the tracks.. you just cut
the tracks and you just play.
I said, "Well, how do you know what to
play?", 'cos I was used to accompanying.
So he said, "Well, just
play what you wanna play",
They don't know what they're
listening to, anyway.
Just play." He said, "If it's too
much, they'll let you know."
He was my.. introduction to the,
you know, R&B record scene.

Joe was the man round town,
as far as recording,
he'd been recording
for everybody.
Actually, my mother, she could teach up
to around about the 3d grade of music.
So she had a lot of little
students in the area.
Of course, I was out trying to shoot
marbles and play football with the rest,
they didn't think I had any talent.
But I'd be listening to
everything that she was
practically teaching, when
I was in the living room.
Actually, I thought it was
a spiritual thing really,
the way that it came about, I was
trying to play Stormy Weather,
it looked like the keys was
just going by themselves and
I was trying to
stick my hands into
those holes and catch
up with the keys.
When my grand-mother came in, she says,
"Donna", that's what she called my mother,
she says, "This boy is in
here playing Stormy Weather"
My favourite classical
pianist was Rachmaninov.
I heard him, he had such
a terrific left hand,
and I said, "I wish my left hand
could be like that", you know.
So I'd put my right hand in my
pocket and just play with my left,
trying to get as fast as Art
Tatum and Rachmaninov.
In the 1960s, jazz clubs were
springing up all over Detroit,
with names like, "The Flame
Show Bar, Phelp's Lounge, The Apex,
The 20 Grand and The Chit-Chat."
These venues were oases,
where the Funk Brothers could
escape the pressure cooker
atmosphere of the studio,
by returning to their roots
and playing cool jazz, into the
wee hours of the morning.
New ideas that hatched in
these spirited jam sessions,
often shimmied their way
into the Snakepit,
adding new textures and
rhythms to the Motown sound.
My stage name was,
"Lottie-the Body"
and I had a
beautiful body.
I was exotic dancer, one of the
greatest exotic dancers in the world.
As a matter of fact, I
consider <i>being</i> the greatest.
And I worked with small
bands, big-big orchestras,
Teddy Harris' big orchestra,
I worked with Count Basie..
- You had to know how.. if she
moved one cheek, there's a
certain drum she wanted you to hit.
If she moved the
left leg, it was a certain
drum you had to hit.
And you had to catch all this stuff,
plus keeping rhythm with the band.
You know, but after you
worked with her a while,
you feel her out and it
was a little easier,
but the first time I worked with her..
oh, I swore I would not do it again.
- I'm sorry, darling.
- You feel like it? - Yeah, let's do it baby.
- Don't kill me, baby!
Make me feel good.
Lot of rhythms that we
did do in the studio,
were rhythms that <i>came
from</i> working with Lottie.
Because we weren't doing too much, what
you call it, Afro-Cuban, you know.
So.. both Grapevines, Marvin Gaye's like...
and Gladys'... All that's Latin stuff.
Well, we did all that
stuff with Lottie.
This is the spot where a
whole lot of stuff happened.
The third, 1-2-3, the
third door over there.
That's where the Chit-Chat was.
When I was coming here, today,
earlier, when I passed by here,
I looked over here, I said, "Oh, there
they are!" It couldn't be no clearer.
The Chit-Chat was the place.
Though it was small,
everybody in Detroit
knew about the Chit-Chat
and knew what was happening
at the Chit-Chat.
With Motown being not that far
down the street here, you had
any Motown act would
show up at the Chit-Chat.
From Marvin..
to Four Tops,
Contours, the Originals,
the Temps..
- We were still at.. really
enjoying our jazz thing
there, you know.
- We'd do things here, that we would do
in the session the next day.
- Right. - You know,
I mean we would do things,
like for instance
that was the uniqueness
of the Funk Brothers,
because, and we were
doing a tune and
and a change was similar
to something, in one of
the jazz tunes that we played.
Earl would say,
"Well, do so-and-so, like
we did last night". And we
would interject that into
the change of the song.
And then the song would
take on a different
colour, something that
they hadn't planned on
but of course the producers.. "Oh,
man, that's it!" And they had a hit.
The Funk Brothers ruled the night-life
of Detroit's club scene, in the 60s.
But their realm was a
rough and tumble world.
Where getting paid at the end of the
evening, often proved as challenging
as the music
they were playing.
Benny was working with us. And Benny
used to go in there in the daytime,
when we weren't working and drink.
And sometime I think, the waitresses
would, sort of put a high tab
on him, than anything else.
But when the owner got ready to pay
us off, he reached up in his thing
and put out a great, big, old, fat gun,
looked like a German Lucas 45,
and popped it on the table and he
looked around at each one of us.
And said, "Well, you know your
drummer, Benny has over-tabbed".
He says, "In fact, he's
gone into y'alls money."
So, at that particular
time, Jamerson pulled
out a piece, his piece
and laid it down
He says, "I got to feed my family" -he
looked. And Robert White pulled out a piece
nobody expected Robert to pull out
a piece, and he laid his down.
And he looked around and I pull out
my little 22 and laid it down.
He said, "What kind of
band have I got here?"
He got so confused, until
he even paid Benny.
He paid everybody.
Motown was really, it was America's
introduction.. to Soul music.
It was America's
introduction to Soul music.
And Soul music is powerful,
soul music makes you believe.
Soul music gives you hope
in the way that you feel.
In the way that you
wanna feel, you know.
And that's what was coming out of
the sounds I heard these men making,
as a child. It gave
me unconscious hope.
I didn't know why. You know,
it gave my father hope.
So for years and years, players and
producers have been trying to..
find that magic Motown
sound and pack it.
As if it's some
sort of a formula.
People would always say
everything <i>but</i>  the musicians.
They would say it
was the artist, the
producers, the way the
building was structured,
or the wood in the floor,
or maybe even food.
You know, but I'd like to see them take
some BBQ ribs or hamburgers, anything
and throw it down in the
studio, shut the door and
count out, 1-2-3-4, and
get a hit out of that.
The formula was the musicians.

By the time The Funk Brothers
recorded Jimmy Ruffin's,
What Becomes of the
Broken Hearted, in 1966,
the Motown sound had travelled a great
distance from the twist records
and blues and do-wop influenced
tracks of its early days.
Advances in recording technology
and an influx of skilled arrangers and
composers, had brought about new levels
of sonic clarity and
musical sophistication.
But the most noticeable difference
was power. Raw power.
The added muscle coincided with the
emergence of keyboardist Earl Van Dyke,
as one of the central
figures down in Studio A.
He was a natural born leader,
whose forceful playing style
was jokingly called
"gorilla piano".
Van Dyke became the hub through which
Motown's producers and arrangers
often communicated their
ideas to the band.
He was like the glue
for everything. Earl
was, you know, he's
a solid keyboard,
you know, he'd have the
piano rocking, actually
rocking. That's why we
call him "Big Funk", OK?
They'd have to have a piano tuner
come in and really redo things,
after Earl got through
playing, see, because
he put so much muscle into it.
When Earl came in, that's when we
developed the style of two pianos
playing, not together, but
accompanying each other.
But there were so many good days
among the musicians in the studio.
<i>- You guys had fun.</i>
- We had fun, we had fun, you know,
And much like I said
before, there were kids
like Stevie, who we
could never get rid of.
 Stevie liked to hang out with the guys.
You know, behind me and the musicians,
so we could never really get rid of Stevie.
And Stevie's always been..
Stevie and the Four Tops,
Marvin Gaye, Bobby Taylor..
all the guys have always
been my, our favourites.
He was part of the
foundation of Motown.
He was one of the first
ones to teach me piano.
A lot of the people here
today are really people that
were the musical
foundation of Motown.
Earl was a great man. And
most of all a spiritual man.
Stevie came here with
Mr Paul, Clarence Paul.
They were standing on the steps,
as you go into the studio,
when we got through doing the little
di-di, the first thing he walked over to
was the piano, where I was. He says,
"Oh, I like the way you play the piano."
Bahm, I showed him a few chords,
he said, "What's that?" I say,
"Well that's the E flat major and I'm
throwing a colour tone in there,
which is the flatted filth
and so forth and so on..
"Yeah!", he shook his head, "yeah"
you know. And so finally,
I found out about a year
later, he didn't need me!
He had learned more
than I'd learned!
And the same thing with Benny. Benny
taught him how to hold his wrists
and how to use those sticks. And
I don't think he needed Benny.
- With anybody he worked with.
- Yeah.
When I started playing music, I didn't start
on the drums, I was playing trombone.
At the same time I played trombone, I
was training down at Brewster Centre.
You know, boxing. And I was
determined to do both of them.
But it was kind of hard, 'cos they
was kicking my butt at Brewster
and when I come to class to play
trombone, my lip be all sore,
I might be trying to play at the
side of my mouth, you know.
So my music teacher told me, "Man,
you gotta make up your mind,
you gonna either box or you gonna be a
musician." you know. So I said, OK.
so, that's when I
started playing drums.
And so, I didn't have a full set of drums,
I had a snare drum, I had a high-hat,
I don't know what I was using
for a cymbal, I don't remember.
But I know my bass drum was one
of those old, heavy cardboard
beer cases. And, to the day,
I have never found a sound, that
sounds as good as that beer case did.
We were sneaking around
town, different studios...
United Sound... - PAC-3
- PAC-3, you know and..
we was doing a little
outside moonlighting, yeah.
- You weren't supposed
to, but you had...
- No, see, 'cos these
guys, some of these guys
were under contract. You know,
exclusive contracts, you know.
So, Motown they wanted
to keep their sound. - Yeah.
- Which.. I guess they was paying
for it, I guess. A few bucks..
So they started putting spies around,
man, in different places, you know..
like in hidden cars and
behind buildings and..
the Sherper's that
was near the studio,
they had spies like
that around, you know.
They offered me $100
a week to be a spy.
- How much? - A hundred.
- $100 a week. - One hundred dollars.
Extra hundred bucks a week. So,
naturally, I took it, I say,
"Well, yeah", you know. 'Cos, threw it
all in the pot. It's all the same to me.
So, I had no intentions of
spying on anybody, anyway.
When they see us coming
out, there'd be at least a couple
of them on the
stake, you know...
"We caught you! You fired,
you fired, you're fired"
and... this is real,
and they say to Jack,
"You're fired twice!
Because we saw you coming
out of there yesterday!"
Finally they call me in,
say, "Look, we're paying you
and you haven't told us anything.
Who's doing what?"
Well, I said, "Nothing happened." They say,
"No, we got pictures of people coming out
of the studios and..", you know,
"as a result, you're fired."
So I say, "Wait a minute. How can you fire
me?" I said, "Now, from what I've seen,
James Bond and all these
guys", I said, "you're
a spy, you get a
Maserati or you get a.."
I said, "You gonna give me $100 a week,
I can't even buy gas." you know.
So, they said, "Well, look..
we still fire you."
So I lost my job as a
spy, but they let me
continue to play piano.
Even during Motown's
golden period,
when Hitsville sessions were
going on around the clock,
the Funk Brothers were still
dashing all over Detroit,
recording for any
studio or record label,
that offered them another
opportunity to create some magic.
Among the hits recorded
outside of Motown
were Jackie Wilson's Higher & Higher,
John Lee Hooker's Boom-Boom-Boom
and the Capitols hit
dance tune, Cool Jerk.

In the mid 60s, Motown
was a permanent
fixture at the top of
the Billboard charts.
As their artists chalked up
one Nr1 hit after another,
they began to emerge as
some of the brightest stars
in the galaxy of R&B
and pop music.
But the Funk Brothers remained
earthbound and unknown.
While they were beginning to share
some of the financial success,
they missed out on that
elusive entity: glory.
Their last great tour, before
they became totally studio bound
opened their eyes to
what fame could mean.
It was the acclaimed, 1965
Tamla-Motown revue,
that took England by storm.
- What amazed me, they
actually knew the musicians.
When we got off of the plane, in
London, these little British guys
come running up to us with these signs.
And I say, "Who are these guys?"
They walked up and said, "We're the
James Jamerson appreciation fan club."
I said, James Jamerson...
and he's not even with us.
Well, maybe I be James Jamerson.
I could use a fan club.
While Motown invaded the UK, the
British were invading the US,
armed with some American
weapons, Motown tunes.
The Beatles landed in New York with
cover versions of Please Mr Postman,
Money and You Really Got a Hold
on Me, in their musical arsenal.
John Lennon remarked that the Motown
drummer hit his snare with so much force,
it sounded like he hit
it with a bloody tree!
There was no doubt they were listening to
Motown's musicians, and listening hard.
In subsequent years, other
British bands covered
Motown hits, including the Rolling
Stones, with their renditions of
Ain't Too Proud to Beg, My Girl
and Going to a Go-Go.
The Funk Brothers musical
influence had spread
to musicians all over the world.
Whether they knew it or not.
- You know in the mid 60s,
when we were at Motown,
we were pretty hot and we
would have producers lined up
back to back, waiting to get into
the studio, to work with us.
They didn't even consider the fact that it
was a 12-hour or 14-hour day sometimes.
Rig means, when you play the song so
much until it begins to get stiff,
and everybody's tired, you say
"Rigor mortis" is here now.
'Cos you exhausted your
creativity on it, you know.
Which happened sometimes, because
especially when we had a producer,
that we told him he was wasting his
money, then he was gonna prove to us
that he wasn't... "Take 64!"
He'd start flogging us...
..wasn't nothing really
gonna happen then.
So we had to find
some place to relax,
because it was really a pressure cook
in the Snakepit, at that time.
One time Earl came up
and said, that he'd found
a funeral parlour,
that we could go
and hide out. So we would just do
this, you know, on many occasions,
'cos as I said, we were
cutting 7 days a week.
The studio finally found out where
we were hanging out. And then
Motown sent somebody over there from
management to knock on the door,
to find out where we were hiding.
<i>- What's that smell?
- Just a little embalming fluid.</i>
Earl had had the funeral
director trained
what to say, in the event that
someone would come over there.
<i>- But I really, really have to go.
- Well, wait! I wanna show you how to use</i>
<i>my saw and bone-crusher.</i>
We would fall out laughing.
- You're not gonna believe this. I
was forced to play a tambourine.
- In church? - No, no.
- Where? - With Charles Harris.
Came to the rehearsal one day with a <i>big</i>
tambourine, it looked like a dish pan.
- Right.
- I'd never touched one.
So I got finished doing my solo, he
said, "Pick the tambourine up, man",
I said, "Hell, no!" He said,
"Pick the tambourine",
he got angry, 'cos I wouldn't
pick the tambourine up.
So I pick the damn tambourine up...
I didn't know <i>what</i> happened.
And I said, "Damn, this feels good."
And I start playing and the tambourine
just took on a life of its own.
I came from Memphis, Tennessee.
And I started,
first beginning with the
drums and everything..
I started in a commerce class, you
know, on a raw typewriter, you know?
I wanted to be a CP Engineer, so we
had to take typing class, you know.
So, I was sitting there at the desk and
I listen to drum beats, so I wind up
playing drum beats
on the typewriter.
So the teacher said, "Hey, what do you
wanna do? Play the drums or be CPE?"
I said, "I think I'm gonna play the
drums." So she kicked me out
and that's how I really got into playing
drums, and I moved to Detroit..
West End, with Kenny Burrell,
Pepper Adams, all the guys,
and got into jazz thing. And
then, while at the 20 Grand,
with Levi Mann, Benny used to come
in and play some of the shows,
I met Benny Benjamin and Benny
said, "Hey man, you sound good.
Why don't you come down?" He said, "Look
come, you can play this stuff, it's easy.
All you got to do is play... and keep
your mouth closed." "Fine." I got in.
Grapevine, the beat
on the tom-tom like that,
you came like all hitting
in the one, so you
took it and put a
backbeat to it, like...
put a backbeat to it.
So Chank, Joe Messina..
the 3 guitars.. and so
Jamerson came in...
so Chank, Joe and Robert came an
octave ahead of, you know, Jamerson..

Bad drug problem and..
was just about at the bottom.
But at one point, Benny
kind of disappeared for a couple
of weeks. So Earl, you know,
started trying to find out
what happened to him.
And he.. he found Benny. And Earl
came in, just when the session started,
he just said, "Guys, I don't think
there's gonna be no session, see..
Benny just died." And that was...
- It turned everybody around.
- Yeah, we didn't do no session that day.

You know when they would pass
the music out to the musicians,
every group would get their
little stuff together,
I'd get together with Earl, because
I play vibes, and they'd pass the music
over to the guitar players, and they would
(...) over there, you know like..
a group of little mad
pies working on it,
they'd be trying their
little parts out,
laughing up their sleeve
- "He he, we got them"
- and so Earl would
just look at them, he
named them "Heckle, Jekyll and Son".
And they'd jump up and say,
"Yeah, we got it. We're ready,
we're ready!" And so, you know..
and they'd really tear it up too, because
they really did have it together.
- All of it was important, as you know.
The parts. And we'd just
work around each other and nothing
ever ran into each other, you know.
- I think the magic was we'd listen to
each other. And we liked each other.
- Yeah. - Which was important.
- Yeah, that's right, Joe.
- We had a friendship.
I think that helped.
- I was born in Mississippi. My little
town was Grenada, Mississippi.
I built my own guitar.. a broom
wire and attached it to the house
and I made the house rock!
I moved to Detroit in '52.. 1952.
- My Dad had a guitar in the house.
He liked the instrument.
He used to play Italian weddings,
when they played the Italian music.
- All that influenced me, you know. Just
anybody, whoever was playing guitar.
Listening to radio and listen to
Chet Atkins, B.B. King, Albert King.
- I'd practice all day. At times
I would skip school to practice.
- The first gig was with this group, with
Marv Johnson. And eventually he did take me
into Motown, and I did a
couple of his recordings.
So what happened, everybody
liked what they heard.
I was playing some pretty
good funk, you know. And
they kind of went for it, so
I ended up staying there.
- I ended up on the night
show, at Soupy Sales.
I was there for 14 years. We
had some very good musicians.
<i>- Who used to come there?</i>
- Oh, we had Charlie Parker,
 Miles, Coltrane..
I never listened to guitar players,
mainly horn men. More in the jazz vein.
I'd like Charlie Parker,
so I'd get off his records.
I was working in a club called
the 20 Grand, with Levi Mann,
and Berry came in and he talked to me,
asked me if I wanted to record for him.
I said, "Yes, I will"
- Did y'all mention Eddie Bongo?
'Cos he was a Funk Brother.
- All through.
- OK. Eddie was a good guy.
Eddie kept a whole lot of mess going.
And he was Marvin's right hand man.
- The thing I remember about him
most was his conga playing.
He could really play.
- If there was one guy that kept things
loose, it was Eddie "Bongo" Brown.
- All got the music sheets
in there, but I don't know
why the hell they put the
music sheet up there.
He couldn't even read! Had
the sheet sitting up there.
Got the producers tricked. Bongo
just playing his ass off, he's playing...
And I look over there, and
he's got a nudie magazine
sitting up there, with legs
gapped open with moon feet.
Oh my God! And they swore
that he was reading.
- He invented a couple of
licks that I hear a lot now,
I think he borrowed them from
the Caribbean, where he'd lick
his finger and slide over the
drum and get a great sound..
he had all kinds of neat little sounds that
way. And he'd put them in between his licks
and people said, "What was that?" You
know, the producers would go crazy.
"What's that? Do that again!"
- When I started out singing I used to
sing in this little blues bar, in New York,
called Dan Lynch and they had this amazing
jukebox and I would go over there,
pretty much every night after I
played, and I would play that song,
 What Becomes of the Broken Hearted.
- I feel as though that "the broken hearted"
is a song that could really live again.
- Well this will be the audition today
and see if we can. - No, it won't be an

That's one of the, probably one of
the more recognizable guitar licks
of the early Motown days. And
when I originally played it,
27 years ago, I didn't think much
about it, only that it worked.
In the small confines of Studio A,
myself and the rest of the musicians
didn't realize what an impact we'd
have on the rest of the world.
He was very quiet and he had a mystique
about him, but you couldn't find a better,
steadier guitarist. And the chords
were jazz, but he made it fit in R&B.
- They called us the
"Oreo cookie guitar section",
because Robert
White sat to my right,
and Eddie Willis sat to my left.
And the white boy. - Joseph.
Shortly after Earl Van Dyke died in
1992, I went out to visit Robert, in L.A.
and went out to eat. And as we're about
to order and the waiter's coming over,
all of a sudden you hear
the guitar line from "My Girl"
come over the speaker,
in the restaurant.
And Robert got really
excited, really animated
and he said, as the
waiter walked over,
he said, "Hey man, you hear that? That's..
that.." and he stopped dead.
And he kind of looked embarrassed
and he looked down at the menu
and he says, "I think I'll
have the BBQ chicken."
And then, you know I just
ordered my thing and
the guy walked away,
and I said, "Robert,
you were gonna tell him
that was you, weren't you?"
He said, he kind of
looked embarrassed,
he said, "Yeah, yeah, but
I don't know.." He looked
at me and he said, "Look
at us tired old fools,
He'd never believe it."
And that flurred me.
Because, I mean, here's
a guy who played
a guitar line, that's the
equivalent, it's like
one of the top 5 of all
time guitar hooks,
it's right up there with "Satisfaction"
by the Stones and "Paperback Writer"
or "Come As You Are", from Nirvana.
At that point I realized,
here's the guy that's lived for 30
years.. this close to his dream,
and yet, instead of being inside the dream,
looking out, he was on the outside
of the dream, looking in. Never
able to touch that dream.
I knew at that point,
Robert desperately needed
some recognition in his lifetime. But he
didn't make it across the finish line
with the rest of the guys.
He just didn't make it.
The Summer of Love introduced
the world to the soaring guitar
and pulsating wha-wha
of Jimmy Hendrix.
The following year, Sly Stone's
relentless Oakland funk,
swept over and enraptured public.
Mesmerized by these new trends,
Motown producer, Norman Whitfield
enlisted the Funk Brothers, along with
innovative newcomers Wha-Wha
Watson and Dennis Coffey,
to help fuse these new elements
into the Motown sound.
Psychedelic Soul had arrived
down in the Snakepit.
In San Fransisco, of course on the west
coast, with Jimmy Hendrix they had
a lot of the fuzz-tones and
they had the wha-wha pedal,
the things like that, the special
effects on some of the guitars.
And what happened was, in one of those
earlier sessions, where we were
rehearsing and working with
producers, Norman Whitfield came in
and he brought in this song, Cloud Nine.
And I had a wha-wha pedal with me
and I took it out and started
playing it and then, within a few
days, I got the call
to do the session.

I haven't heard anybody, anybody play
"What's Going On" like the record, ever.
No way. - The only person I
ever heard do it was Babbitt,
last week. I heard Babbitt.
- Oh, Babbitt did it last week?
- When I heard Babbitt
- I'm sorry - the other night,
it just blew me away, man.
It was like dang!
I felt like I was back,
you know, 35-40 years
ago, as a kid. I'm sorry,
what'd you say, Nate?
- You remember, as a bass player in
Detroit, I know I came a little later but..
- You weren't late.
- '72. - OK.
- But if you could not play
that solo, from that record,
that Bob Babbitt did...
You remember? Scorpio?
- Oh, yeah. - You weren't a bass player.
You couldn't get a gig!
- That's right.
- You couldn't get a gig, man.
And he's telling the truth.
- You couldn't get a gig.
Scorpio... oh, man!!
If you couldn't play Babbitt's
solo, you weren't doing nothing.
You see what was so beautiful
about it, people loved Babbitt,
it wasn't about no colour,
they just loved the musicians.
All the cats in the hood,
"Man, that's Babbitt!"
When I went to 7th
grade, I guess
it was, I was in
the choir and the
same choir teacher was
also the orchestra
teacher, she said to me,
"Well, I know somebody
that's gonna play bass in
the orchestra next year."
And boom, it's me! She's
looking at me, point at me.
So I started playing
upright bass.
I'm supposed to be
studying classical, which
I am, as long as my
mother and dad are up,
soon as they go to bed, they had
some stations on the radio, in
Pittsburgh, where they had what they
called "Race music". Where you could hear
the black, black music. And
I used to take my bass,
and go into the kitchen, turn the radio
on and while everybody's sleeping,
I'd be playing with the radio.
'Round 1967,
I'd been working live
with Stevie Wonder.
And Stevie brought me in to do
my first session at Motown.
Now, you gotta remember James, he.. he
set the bass down for the Motown sound.
Man, nobody can play this.
- What?
- Nobody can play this,
lying on their back.
- You could, if you were
James Jamerson.
This is the story. This is hard
to believe. But it's really true.
- You gotta tell me this one.
- Let me tell you what happened.
Marvin was working
on putting all of us
together, with the
"What's Going On" thing.
And it was experimenting
with a lot of things.
But what happened, he
decided he needed Jamerson.
So, Jamerson was working at a local club.
And Marvin found out where he was working
and he went over there to get him.
Jamerson was blasted.
So he says, "Well, I gotta get him back,
because I got this, I gotta get it off."
Brought him back over here, to the studio.
Jamerson really didn't wanna do this,
but because, being Marvin,
he said "OK, I'll try it."
So Jamerson couldn't
sit up on the.. you
know, he had a high stool
he used to sit on.
- Yeah, right like a string bass player.
- He lay right out, where you were laying,
and started playing this,
no one believed it.
He did a job, that no one
could do standing up.
He did it lying down.
That was James Jamerson.
- The master.
- Did you feel the pressure? (...)
- Sure, there was pressure, I mean...
You're sitting in Jamerson's seat. You know
what I'm saying? And to do what he did..
I mean it was almost an impossible thing.
- I'm sure you just were yourself.
- Yeah, well, I tried to
do the best I could.
- Watching a documentary, was talking
'bout some of Atlantic recordings.
With Aretha Franklin, early
recordings, and she had like
basically a totally white
band from Nashville.
- No, from Memphis,
in Muscle Shoals.
- Right. OK. And then Martin
Luther King was assassinated.
James Brown started to change his
vibe, with "I'm black & I'm proud"
The whole thing changed. And a lot of
people felt "Well, we don't wanna use
the white musicians. We
keep it to ourself. Did you
feel any sort of coming into
this environment that..
you felt any racial difference?
- There was such a.. a closeness.
I mean, I can't..
and when Martin Luther King died,
they never expressed to me any
kind of hostility or anything. And
I was, I felt as sad as they did.
But.. I never felt that,
from any of these guys.
I always felt like.. like.. I don't know..
I was like one of them.
I'm sorry..
On the evening of July 23d, 1967,
the Detroit police busted up
an after hours, "blind pig" speakeasy,
at the corner of 12th and Clairmount.
and all hell broke loose.
The Funk Brothers
came out of a
recording session,
to a city in flames.
- Yeah, the sky was red.
- Everything was burning down.
- You protect your family.
That's just the way
it was and I would've
gone down for them.
Even if it was at the
hands of a black brother.
'Cos he's invading my territory.
That's just the way I felt.
I didn't think about colour.
These are my brothers here.
So no one had to rally
us, it was just:
We have to get from here to the car.
And that was the only thing
we were interested about.
It was our mission to get
our people home safe.
- But I also feel at the same time,
that, had the role been reversed,
and we had been in an
area, where it was more
predominantly a white area
and something broke out,
that I would've took a
bullet for Jack, I mean..
- I believe it.
- Yeah, we would've done the same.
The end of the 1960s found
America watching in horror,
as a daily stream
of televised death
came back from the
war, in Vietnam.
Back on the home front, the
cultural and social revolution
being waged in the streets was
further polarizing the masses.
Motown played a pre-eminent
role in the cultural soundtrack
that framed all these events. And
nowhere more so, than in Vietnam,
where terrified and
disillusioned GIs
found comfort in the grooves, played by
the Funk Brothers, and in the words
and melodies sung
by Motown's stars.
But there was no comforting
refrain, down in the Snakepit.
Still reeling from the death of Benny
Benjamin, and concerned that
James Jamerson's personal daemons
were leading him down the same path,
the Funk Brothers needed a rallying
cry to pull themselves together.
In 1970, they found
it, in "What's Going On".
Marvin Gaye's anguished plea
for sanity, in a world gone mad.
Helping Marvin
realize his vision,
the Funk Brothers elevated
the level of their artistry,
from the dance floor
to the world stage.

When Marvin Gaye first
recorded "What's Going On",
to us it was a very
important record.
Musically, we felt that it
was some of our best work.
It was the first record that
Motown ever given the musicians
some credit, on an album.
And little did we know, we were biting
our own time, but we kept recording,
for about another year. And..
many more hits to come, you know.
So, one day, we went to the studio
and we were supposed to record,
and there was a big sign
on the door, saying...
"There won't be no work here, today.
Motown are moving to L.A."
Wow, what a break!
I suppose, they were just looking for
a new sound. I suppose...you know..
So we just kept doing, what we usually
do, what we was doing before Motown
and that was playing in the
clubs around the city,
playing our blues,
playing our jazz.
That's just about
the way it ended.
When Motown left Detroit, there
was no warning, no announcement
and no way of preparing for it.
And that's the move that they had to make,
I mean a company doesn't have to
explain to every individual,
that they're moving.
But it kind of left all of us, kinda
like... "What are we gonna do?"
Funny thing was, we always had that
idea about, it would never end.
You know, we felt like it
would go on and on and on.
But, as you can see, it ended.
Hoping to hold on to their dreams,
some of the Funk Brothers
followed Motown out to L.A.
But the west coast music scene
was too foreign to them. And
without the emotional support
the Funk Brothers family had always
provided for each other, they were lost.
He missed his friends, the Funk
Brothers.. just the atmosphere.
It's totally different in
California, than in Detroit.
He wasn't getting the-
receiving the phone calls
like before, working
in a studio, yeah,
to work in a studio. And..
there was a battle there,
you know, of emotions and
probably feeling less than a man,
or less than a dad, to provide for
us, from what he used to do before.
So I've seen a lot of hurt
and pain, and the illness
and the struggles
with the alcohol.
Wasn't going right for him.
He wanted to do everything,
he was used to doing
everything, for everyone.
And then it was his time,
where <i>he</i> needed help.
And a lot of times,
no one was there...
or he didn't wanna listen, 'cos
he can be hard-headed too. So...
In 1983, James Jamerson
scalped a ticket
for the nationally televised
show "Motown 25",
and stepped into a balcony seat.
Two months later, he slipped away.
For ever.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time to give it up..
give up the love for Detroit's
unsung, musical heroes.
The drum section: Uriel Jones & Pistol Allen,
and the late Benny Benjamin.
On the vibes and percussion,
the fabulous, tambourine man
Jack Ashford and the
late "Bongo" Eddie.
Guitar section: the one, none other,
the brother Eddie Willis, Joe Messina
and the late Robert White.
On the keyboards: Joe Hunter, Johnny Griffith
and the late, great Earl Van Dyke.
And on bass: Bob Babbitt and the
greatest bass player of all time..
James Jamerson. Here they are!

I think it's very important
for people of my generation,
to, not only know history, but to
also experience it and allow it
to change them. I have so much
respect and so much to learn
from these people,
that came before me.
I mean the people are great
people, not just great musicians.
I think that's what I'll carry with
me, just being able to converse
and talk to people, who have done
so much to influence what I do,
and what I wanna be. The
people bring the place alive
and I think that's very important.
Hitsville wasn't these buildings,

were in the building,
