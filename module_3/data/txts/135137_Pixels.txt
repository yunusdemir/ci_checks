<i>Mother told me.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Yes, she told me.</i>
&nbsp
<i>That I'd meet girls like you.</i>
&nbsp
<i>She also told me.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Stay away
You'll never know what you'll catch.</i>
&nbsp
Cooper, it's open.
&nbsp
It's open?
&nbsp
Come on!
&nbsp
It's supposed to be awesome.
&nbsp
- Thank you.
- Hey, give me back my quarters, you hoser!
&nbsp
Mom!
&nbsp
<i>They just seem a little weird.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Surrender, surrender.</i>
&nbsp
<i>But don't give yourself away.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Whatever happened to all this season's.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Losers of the year?</i>
&nbsp
<i>Every time I got to thinking.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Where'd they disappear?</i>
&nbsp
<i>But when I woke up, Mom and Dad.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Are rolling on the couch.</i>
&nbsp
Damn.
&nbsp
What?
&nbsp
I suck.
&nbsp
<i>Mommy's all right, daddy's all right.</i>
&nbsp
<i>They just seem a little weird.</i>
&nbsp
Wow, Sam.
&nbsp
How are you so good at this?
You've never even played it before.
&nbsp
I don't know.
&nbsp
There's a pattern to how they're moving.
Watch.
&nbsp
I don't see it, but you sure as hell do.
&nbsp
<i>Away.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Surrender, surrender.</i>
&nbsp
<i>But don't give yourself away.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Surrender, surrender.</i>
&nbsp
<i>But don't give yourself away.</i>
&nbsp
Use the Force. Use the Force.
&nbsp
Hey, Chewie.
&nbsp
You're a superstar, dude.
&nbsp
And it's time to show the world.
&nbsp
<i>Surrender.</i>
&nbsp
<i>But don't give yourself away.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Surrender, surrender.</i>
&nbsp
<i>But don't give yourself away.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Attention, all contestants.</i>
&nbsp
<i>The competition will start in 15 minutes.</i>
&nbsp
You too? That's so funny.
&nbsp
Really?
&nbsp
I think you're pretty darn foxy yourself.
&nbsp
Lady Lisa,
I'll love you till the end of time.
&nbsp
- Who are you talking to?
- Nobody!
&nbsp
We'll talk later.
&nbsp
You're Ludlow Lamonsoff,
the Wonder Kid, right?
&nbsp
Who told you that? The government?
&nbsp
'Cause I'm this close to figuring out
the secret of the Bermuda Triangle.
&nbsp
Wow, you don't have any friends, do you?
&nbsp
Just my grandma.
&nbsp
Yoo-hoo!
&nbsp
Well, Wonder Kid, you can hang out with us.
&nbsp
Really?
&nbsp
What's up, geeks and goobers?
&nbsp
They call me the Fire Blaster!
&nbsp
'Cause my hands are blazing fast,
&nbsp
and also I will blast and burn
all my competitors' weak-ass moves.
&nbsp
You must be the local talent.
&nbsp
If this was a fugly contest,
I'd be in trouble.
&nbsp
At least we didn't make up
our own nicknames, Fire Blaster.
&nbsp
Who cares who came up with it?
&nbsp
It's totally tubular.
&nbsp
<i>Welcome, gamers, to the first annual.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Worldwide Video Arcade Championships!</i>
&nbsp
<i>Tonight, we have representatives here
from the</i> Guinness Book of World Records,
&nbsp
<i>as well as NASA, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration,</i>
&nbsp
<i>who will be videotaping
tonight's competition</i>
&nbsp
<i>to be included in a compilation of 1982's
news events and popular culture.</i>
&nbsp
<i>That videotape will be placed
in a space probe</i>
&nbsp
<i>which will be launched by NASA
into our solar system</i>
&nbsp
<i>with the hope of connecting to,
and perhaps providing a message for</i>
&nbsp
<i>extraterrestrial life, should it exist.</i>
&nbsp
Oh, it exists.
&nbsp
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
&nbsp
<i>start your gaming!</i>
&nbsp
<i>All right, ladies and gentlemen,
what an evening we have had here.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Six new US records set.</i>
&nbsp
<i>- Three new world records set.</i>
- Oh, yeah.
&nbsp
<i>And, as the smoke clears,
right now we have a tie.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Two hundred and fifty-nine points</i>
&nbsp
<i>for your new</i> Pac-Man <i>world champion.</i>
&nbsp
<i>The Fire Blaster, Eddie Plant!</i>
&nbsp
Go, Fire Blaster!
&nbsp
<i>And 259 points</i>
&nbsp
<i>for your new Galaga Centipede
world champion, rookie sensation,</i>
&nbsp
<i>Sam Brenner!</i>
&nbsp
Yeah, Sam!
&nbsp
<i>Well, gentlemen,
how 'bout we break this tie.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Let's play.</i>
&nbsp
Donkey Kong!
&nbsp
- Good luck, man.
- Thanks.
&nbsp
You have the patterns down pretty good
with these games.
&nbsp
You're gonna be tough to beat.
&nbsp
<i>Buddy you're a boy make a big noise.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Playing in the street
gonna be a big man some day.</i>
&nbsp
<i>You got mud on your face
You big disgrace.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Kickin' your can all over the place.</i>
&nbsp
<i>- Singin '
- We will, we will rock you.</i>
&nbsp
<i>We will, we will rock you.</i>
&nbsp
You see, the thing about <i>Donkey Kong</i> is,
&nbsp
At the higher levels the barrels become
more random, possessed almost.
&nbsp
And playing by the patterns
doesn't do the trick anymore.
&nbsp
Does it, Brenner?
&nbsp
<i>We will, we will rock you.</i>
&nbsp
Congratulations.
&nbsp
On coming in second!
&nbsp
Fire Blaster is the world champ!
&nbsp
The local yokel looked destiny in the eye
and blinked.
&nbsp
He's a loser,
and he will always be a loser.
&nbsp
Sam!
&nbsp
Sam, Sam, wait.
&nbsp
Sam, listen.
&nbsp
You're still gonna go to MIT
&nbsp
and invent something
that makes you a millionaire.
&nbsp
And maybe even marry Olivia Newton-John.
&nbsp
I was actually thinking Samantha Fox.
&nbsp
Nice, but she's no Sheena Easton.
&nbsp
Well,
&nbsp
there's always Madonna.
&nbsp
How about Scarlett Johansson?
&nbsp
So hot.
&nbsp
Mmm. Not Halle Berry hot, but so, so hot.
&nbsp
And don't forget Katy Perry.
&nbsp
What are we doin' right now? We're too old.
It's just gross already.
&nbsp
Plus, you're married to a woman
who hates you.
&nbsp
She doesn't hate me.
She just doesn't get it, you know.
&nbsp
We don't have the free time to do stuff
together like we did 10 years ago.
&nbsp
This job is killing me, man.
&nbsp
If I were you,
&nbsp
maybe a half hour a day,
turn off the cell phone,
&nbsp
shut down the emails,
put away the Reggie bars
&nbsp
and focus on your wife.
&nbsp
<i>The President's
gaffe-filled summer continued today...</i>
&nbsp
Hold on a second. I gotta see this.
&nbsp
<i>At Joseph Knibb Elementary School to
promote his new youth reading initiative.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Here's what happened.</i>
&nbsp
<i>"Mittens jumped up onto the table
and knocked over the whole bowl of soup."</i>
&nbsp
<i>"Mrs. Pickles gassed... Gasped."</i>
&nbsp
<i>She gasped.</i>
&nbsp
<i>"And the whole room fell silent."</i>
&nbsp
<i>"This was casta..."</i>
&nbsp
<i>"This is cast..."</i>
&nbsp
<i>"Catatastrophic."</i>
&nbsp
<i>Catastrophic.</i>
&nbsp
<i>I got it, sweetheart, okay?</i>
&nbsp
<i>Why'd you yell at me?</i>
&nbsp
<i>You're mean.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Leave her alone.</i>
&nbsp
<i>The President can't read.</i>
&nbsp
You gotta learn how to read, buddy.
It's as simple as that.
&nbsp
I was on three hours' sleep, all right?
&nbsp
Your economics
are hurting poor people!
&nbsp
Nice to see ya!
&nbsp
You've got the blood of
innocent children on your hands.
&nbsp
Thank you for your support.
&nbsp
I can't afford to go to
college because of you!
&nbsp
That's a lovely dress.
&nbsp
- You're ruining the country!
- Yeah, we're all in this together, now.
&nbsp
You got a rough life, bud.
&nbsp
- Sir? Okay.
- Thank you.
&nbsp
But at least you have a life.
&nbsp
Look, Brenner,
you're meant for something more than this.
&nbsp
You just need to channel your genius
into something productive.
&nbsp
I mean, you were incredible at video games
back in the day,
&nbsp
but that's a useless skill now.
&nbsp
It's like being a great blacksmith.
&nbsp
Ooh! That hurt, man.
That's catatastrophic that you said that.
&nbsp
I'm gonna get you back for that.
&nbsp
Mr. President,
if you take away all the libraries, sir,
&nbsp
how will the children ever learn to read?
&nbsp
Blacksmith, over and out.
&nbsp
Hello. I am a nerd from the Nerd Brigade.
&nbsp
Here to nerd out
on all your audio and visual needs.
&nbsp
Do you have to say that
every time you show up at a house?
&nbsp
If I wanna get paid, yes.
&nbsp
Isn't that kind of demeaning?
&nbsp
Only if someone brings it up.
&nbsp
- Okay, I won't bring it up, then.
- Thanks.
&nbsp
Come on in.
&nbsp
So, what am I installing?
&nbsp
A new 85-inch, 4K, 3D TV,
&nbsp
- PlayStation 4, 7.1 surround-sound speakers.
- Mmm-hmm.
&nbsp
Really, if you guys sell it,
we've probably bought it.
&nbsp
Huh. Is it your birthday?
&nbsp
No, my parents are getting a divorce.
&nbsp
Oh. So it's like 10 birthdays.
&nbsp
Yeah, my dad cheated on my mom
with his 19-year-old Pilates instructor.
&nbsp
Her name's Sinnamon, with an "S"
&nbsp
which really tells you
all you need to know about her.
&nbsp
No, I could hear a little more.
You got any pictures?
&nbsp
I'm kiddin'. I'm sorry to hear that.
&nbsp
My mom kind of hates him right now.
&nbsp
And she says she's gonna invent a
slut-seeking missile to take out Sinnamon.
&nbsp
Okay, Matty, you don't need to tell
the nice installer man our whole life.
&nbsp
Whoa.
&nbsp
I'm sorry, "Whoa"?
&nbsp
- What?
- No, just you. Whoa.
&nbsp
Me? Whoa?
I don't even know what that means.
&nbsp
I mean, it's just, when your son told me that
your husband left you for a 19-year-old,
&nbsp
I guess I thought you were gonna be, like
&nbsp
one of those
"hot when we first met in high school,"
&nbsp
"but then let herself go
and got a potbelly and turkey neck"
&nbsp
"with a hairy chin."
&nbsp
But clearly that's not the case.
&nbsp
So more like,
&nbsp
"Whoa, I should have brushed my teeth
before I left the house this morning."
&nbsp
Or studio apartment,
if we're getting real here.
&nbsp
Did you really
not brush your teeth this morning?
&nbsp
No, I did.
&nbsp
I guess I should just start
settin' this stuff up right now.
&nbsp
Go get 'em.
&nbsp
Colonel Devereux.
&nbsp
You need to see this, sir.
&nbsp
We're under attack.
&nbsp
What the hell are those things?
&nbsp
So are you a gamer?
&nbsp
Uh...
&nbsp
Yeah.
&nbsp
I played when I was your age.
&nbsp
Were you any good?
&nbsp
I was pretty good
at some of the classic games.
&nbsp
Hmm. Classics.
You mean like <i>Halo and Call of Duty.</i>
&nbsp
No! The real classics.
&nbsp
<i>Defender, Pac-Man, Asteroids.</i>
&nbsp
Games you played in an arcade
&nbsp
which was a building outside of your house.
&nbsp
You would go there with your friends,
listen to music, cute girls everywhere.
&nbsp
In ancient times,
they called it "socializing."
&nbsp
What are you guys talking about?
&nbsp
- Video games.
- Video games.
&nbsp
I'll be right back.
&nbsp
Mrs. Van Patten.
&nbsp
All finished up down there.
&nbsp
I need you to sign the work order.
&nbsp
Okay.
&nbsp
Mrs. Van Patten, are you in the closet?
&nbsp
Yes.
&nbsp
Not judging,
but what are you doin' in the closet?
&nbsp
I'm mostly crying.
&nbsp
A little drinking.
&nbsp
Probably equally crying and drinking.
&nbsp
Something I do often, also.
&nbsp
But why in the closet?
&nbsp
Because I don't want Matty to see me.
&nbsp
I'm comin' in the closet, Mrs. Van Patten.
&nbsp
I'm opening the door.
&nbsp
Are you all right?
&nbsp
I'm sobbing on the floor of my closet
drinking Chardonnay out of a sippy cup.
&nbsp
So I guess not.
&nbsp
Sorry. I withdraw the question.
&nbsp
Oh, God.
&nbsp
- Wanna talk about it?
- No.
&nbsp
Yes!
&nbsp
Yes.
&nbsp
Oh, God.
&nbsp
Sir, we are in the midst of an aerial
attack by an unidentified force!
&nbsp
Activate the QRF.
&nbsp
Mama! No!
&nbsp
We were high-school sweethearts.
&nbsp
- Mmm-hmm.
- The perfect couple.
&nbsp
Do you know that he
proposed in a waterfall?
&nbsp
- I mean, a freaking waterfall.
- Smooth.
&nbsp
But now,
according to a text I got 20 minutes ago,
&nbsp
he's marrying
a 19-year-old named after a spice.
&nbsp
It's not even spelled correctly.
&nbsp
Mmm.
&nbsp
It's just not where I thought I'd be
at this point in my life.
&nbsp
Oh, God. I hear that.
&nbsp
I was supposed to have a baby
with my ex-wife.
&nbsp
And the doctor
who was helping us make the baby
&nbsp
did help us make the baby.
&nbsp
But, unfortunately, I wasn't in the room.
&nbsp
Maybe this really is all for the best.
&nbsp
How do you mean?
&nbsp
You already married the wrong guy.
You got the worst part over with.
&nbsp
True, and you married the wrong girl.
&nbsp
Maybe it just means
we're gonna meet the right person now.
&nbsp
Yeah.
&nbsp
Yeah.
&nbsp
Whoa!
&nbsp
Are you trying to kiss me?
&nbsp
Absolutely not.
&nbsp
Oh, God.
&nbsp
Sorry, I thought we were having a moment.
&nbsp
We were. A moment.
&nbsp
Look, you seem like a very nice guy,
but I just met you, okay?
&nbsp
And, no offense,
&nbsp
I don't think my rebound guy
is a 210-pound person
&nbsp
that installs flat screens for a living.
&nbsp
First of all, 208.
&nbsp
And, wow,
I didn't peg you as the snobby type.
&nbsp
Snob? Me?
&nbsp
Okay.
&nbsp
I am not a snob.
&nbsp
Okay, well, let's just say I was a
billionaire, and we were out on my giant yacht
&nbsp
in the middle of the Mediterranean,
sipping champagne,
&nbsp
and I went in to kiss you.
&nbsp
Would you have kissed me back, then?
&nbsp
Hold that thought, snobby.
&nbsp
Big Man!
&nbsp
<i>Can you get to
the White House right now?</i>
&nbsp
I'll be there in 15.
&nbsp
While I'd love to stick around
&nbsp
and listen to you lie about not wanting to
make out with the yacht guy,
&nbsp
I have to go.
&nbsp
For the record, I'm an amazing kisser.
&nbsp
All us nerds are.
&nbsp
'Cause we appreciate it more.
&nbsp
You didn't even brush your teeth
this morning.
&nbsp
I ate a Tic Tac.
&nbsp
Too late, sweetheart.
You had your shot and ya blew it.
&nbsp
I'm not following you.
&nbsp
Yeah, whatever you say, stalky. It's over.
Deal with it.
&nbsp
Whoa, she went from zero
to psycho in 3.4 seconds,
&nbsp
a new world record.
&nbsp
Hey, Steve-O.
&nbsp
There's a crazy woman following me. I
guarantee she's here to shoot the President.
&nbsp
And if I were you,
I'd break out the billy club
&nbsp
and go full throttle on her, seriously.
&nbsp
Go right on through, Lieutenant Colonel.
&nbsp
At this point, it's
primarily data collection.
&nbsp
- Why are you following me?
- Oh, God.
&nbsp
Oh, God. I can't believe
they even let you in here.
&nbsp
Right.
&nbsp
Colonel Van Patten,
you can go right into the Situation Room.
&nbsp
Yeah, see, they need me
in the Situation Room,
&nbsp
- so have fun doing whatever you're doing.
- Mmm.
&nbsp
Mr. Brenner, the President is
waiting for you in the Oval Office.
&nbsp
Somebody's more important.
&nbsp
Freddy, can you keep the
riffraff outta here?
&nbsp
Yo, wassup?
&nbsp
Oh, come on,
you couldn't have at least changed?
&nbsp
You told me to rush right over.
&nbsp
What's going on, man?
Why's it so crazy out there?
&nbsp
Our Air Force base
in Guam was attacked.
&nbsp
By who?
&nbsp
I'm not sure.
That's what I wanted to ask you.
&nbsp
Come here. Check this out.
&nbsp
- Me?
- Yes, you. Come here.
&nbsp
Listen to this.
&nbsp
Does that sound familiar to you?
&nbsp
Yeah. Where do I know that from?
&nbsp
- Can you freeze it?
- Yeah, hold on.
&nbsp
Go in tighter.
&nbsp
That can't be real.
&nbsp
Okay, so you're seeing
the same thing I'm seeing.
&nbsp
What kind of mushrooms
did that guy put on our burgers?
&nbsp
- They're ready for you, Mr. President.
- Great.
&nbsp
Now I gotta explain this
to the National Security Council.
&nbsp
Listen, do me a favor, Sam.
&nbsp
Watch that again, okay?
&nbsp
And just see if there's anything
you can find to help us out.
&nbsp
Yeah. Can I sit in your chair?
&nbsp
No, you can't, and everything's recorded.
&nbsp
Okay, I won't. I won't. I won't.
&nbsp
I'm sittin' in the chair. Gimme a break.
&nbsp
Mr. President, we told the press that it was
an advanced weapons test that misfired.
&nbsp
- So there's no mass panic yet.
- Well, good.
&nbsp
Then let's solve this
thing before there is.
&nbsp
Mr. President, someone's made
a major breakthrough in drone technology
&nbsp
and it wasn't us.
&nbsp
This has got
Moscow's fingerprints all over it.
&nbsp
Nonsense!
It's an Iranian black-ops sideshow.
&nbsp
I guarantee it.
&nbsp
I have a theory.
&nbsp
I think, based on analysis
of the footage,
&nbsp
that preliminary indications
are that we were attacked by.
&nbsp
Galaga.
&nbsp
By who, sir?
&nbsp
Galaga.
&nbsp
Sons of bitches.
&nbsp
Then let's blow Galaga to hell.
&nbsp
Who's Galaga?
&nbsp
It's an old-timey video game, '80s kind
of folks like my dad used to play.
&nbsp
Mr. President, there is no nation on Earth
that has the military technology
&nbsp
to simply pixelate entire buildings.
&nbsp
Except Iran.
&nbsp
Forget Iran!
&nbsp
I'm thinking this is a cutting-edge
multinational enterprise.
&nbsp
An NGO, a think tank,
maybe even a corporation.
&nbsp
We're thinkin' Iran
when we should be thinking Google.
&nbsp
So let's blow up Google.
&nbsp
Can somebody take Grandpa's keys away
before he drives us into a ditch?
&nbsp
- Who is this person?
- The sandwich guy?
&nbsp
This here is, uh,
my old arcade game technical
&nbsp
advisor person-guy.
&nbsp
Sam Brenner. He works in the tech sector.
&nbsp
So Caltech, MIT?
&nbsp
MIT. Yes.
&nbsp
Mississippi Institute
of Technology, though.
&nbsp
Not the one you were thinking of.
&nbsp
Anyway, more to the current point,
&nbsp
uh, Mr. Brenner here
was the World Galaga Champion.
&nbsp
He knows everything
there is to know about this game.
&nbsp
So, what is it you and your orange shorts
barged in here to say?
&nbsp
Oh, just the Galaga that attacked us,
&nbsp
that doesn't exist anymore.
&nbsp
Hello. You can download <i>Galaga</i>
on your phone for $1.99.
&nbsp
Yeah, not this version though, Blue Lagoon.
&nbsp
The <i>Galaga</i> that exists
now came out in 1986.
&nbsp
But this is the 1982 arcade version.
&nbsp
And all those machines, they recalled them,
they reprogrammed them,
&nbsp
because there were glitches
in the original code.
&nbsp
You can see from the giant space bugs,
the way they come swoopin' in.
&nbsp
Kind of ziggy-zaggy.
&nbsp
Ziggy-zag? Is that the snobby term?
&nbsp
So someone
designed these space bugs
&nbsp
after an old out-of-print version
of a video game from 30 years ago
&nbsp
that nobody would know today?
&nbsp
Does she really get to talk twice?
She's not even at the grown-ups table.
&nbsp
I'm sorry. Is this a National
Security Council meeting,
&nbsp
or a dorm-room drug party?
&nbsp
Our nation has just been attacked
by an unknown military force.
&nbsp
If this gets out to the press
that we're pinning the blame
&nbsp
on some old computer game,
&nbsp
they'll not only mock you in the news,
Mr. President, they'd impeach you!
&nbsp
So I suggest the man in the orange shorts
leave the room immediately.
&nbsp
And those of us with long pants
and government positions
&nbsp
can discuss our options.
&nbsp
All right, Brenner. Do me a favor.
Take off, all right? I appreciate the help.
&nbsp
Bye!
&nbsp
Sorry, everybody.
&nbsp
Mr. President.
&nbsp
Generals and Admirals.
&nbsp
Guys in suits.
&nbsp
Zac Efron.
&nbsp
Gandalf,
&nbsp
and Harry Potter in the same room.
&nbsp
Imagine that.
&nbsp
Grandpa,
we'll see you around the, uh, nursing home.
&nbsp
Oh, uh, the sandwich guy is here.
&nbsp
Fooled you.
&nbsp
<i>Past the shortstop
into left center field for a single.</i>
&nbsp
<i>That's the second straight inning
where Washington has led off with a single.</i>
&nbsp
<i>They're talking about how
he's standing straight up over the plate.</i>
&nbsp
<i>That seems to be working out for him,</i>
&nbsp
<i>'cause he just drove
that ball into the gap hard.</i>
&nbsp
<i>First pitch
taken outside for a ball, 1-0,</i>
&nbsp
<i>and the 1-0 swung...</i>
&nbsp
Brenner!
&nbsp
What's your problem, dude?
&nbsp
- What's goin' on?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
&nbsp
No, Brenner!
&nbsp
No, Brenner, no, no, no!
&nbsp
Stop! It's me! It's me! It's Ludlow!
It's Ludlow.
&nbsp
- Ludlow Lamonsoff, the Wonder Kid?
- Yeah.
&nbsp
How'd you get into my van?
&nbsp
I've been in there ever since
you went to that nice lady's house.
&nbsp
She's cute, by the way.
&nbsp
- What?
- Hey!
&nbsp
- What is that?
- This is moisturizer.
&nbsp
Show me what that is.
&nbsp
Chloroform?
&nbsp
Is that what that says?
&nbsp
You were gonna drug me?
&nbsp
- Only as a last resort.
- What are you...
&nbsp
- There was something I had to tell you.
- Why didn't you call me, then?
&nbsp
Because the CIA
has been tapping my phones
&nbsp
ever since I found out
the Zapruder film has been edited.
&nbsp
JFK shot first!
&nbsp
Ludlow, it is you!
&nbsp
- Hi, buddy! Let me look at you!
- Hey! Good to see you, my boy!
&nbsp
How are you? My goodness! Look at you!
&nbsp
- I know.
- Stayin' in shape!
&nbsp
I'm on an all protein diet,
but I'm also doing carbs.
&nbsp
- Good.
- But seriously, Brenner.
&nbsp
There's something I have to show you.
&nbsp
And let's just say
&nbsp
it's a game changer.
&nbsp
You're the first guest I've had here.
Voluntarily.
&nbsp
That's a shocker.
&nbsp
If Lady Lisa was real,
&nbsp
she'd have about
17 restraining orders out on you.
&nbsp
Actually, I think if she was real,
&nbsp
things might just play out
a little bit differently.
&nbsp
- Hmm?
- You wanna know how I know that?
&nbsp
- Mmm.
<i>- If She Was Real.</i>
&nbsp
A book written and illustrated
by Ludlow Lamonsoff.
&nbsp
Oh, boy.
&nbsp
You should sell that at Barnes & Unstable.
&nbsp
- Do you want a copy?
- No.
&nbsp
I have eight others.
&nbsp
Why am I here right now?
Why did you try to roofie me?
&nbsp
- Right. Thank you for reminding me.
- Uh-huh.
&nbsp
Okay. Follow me.
&nbsp
Earlier today, our military base in Guam
was attacked by this guy, Galaga.
&nbsp
How would you know that?
&nbsp
I have a pen pal in Guam.
His name is Baubau.
&nbsp
Baubau was terribly frightened,
&nbsp
so I hacked into the government's servers
to assure Baubau that everything was okay.
&nbsp
But you know what?
&nbsp
- What?
- Everything was not okay.
&nbsp
Ludlow!
&nbsp
Did you get me some diet root beer
while you were out?
&nbsp
- You remember my grandma.
- Sure.
&nbsp
She's still a character
after all those years.
&nbsp
No, no, Grandma! It's funny.
I didn't get a chance to because, um...
&nbsp
Oh, what happened? Oh, I remember now.
&nbsp
I'm trying to save the world
from annihilation!
&nbsp
Are you nuts?
&nbsp
You cracker!
&nbsp
Don't yell at me!
&nbsp
So look, I know that sometimes people
think of me as a bit of a conspiracy nut.
&nbsp
Right.
&nbsp
But sometimes, Brenner, sometimes
&nbsp
the conspiracies are real.
&nbsp
Have you been playing <i>Space Invaders</i>
a lot lately?
&nbsp
I have. How did you know that?
&nbsp
'Cause you're invading my space. Back up.
&nbsp
Brenner, do you remember
when we were children,
&nbsp
and we played
in that video game championship?
&nbsp
Of course, buddy.
&nbsp
Do you remember how
there was a tape of the event
&nbsp
and all the games that were played
that was then put in a capsule
&nbsp
and shot out into the universe
&nbsp
- looking for extraterrestrial life?
- Mmm-hmm.
&nbsp
I have reason to believe
that some alien life force found that tape
&nbsp
and has sent down real-life versions
of what they saw
&nbsp
to attack us.
&nbsp
Brenner, I spent the day on 4chan
&nbsp
searching for messages
from the aliens to prove my theory.
&nbsp
- And you wanna know something?
- Tell me.
&nbsp
I came up absolutely empty.
&nbsp
So then, as a distraction, I got up
&nbsp
to try to watch an episode of <i>One Tree Hill</i>
that I recorded on my VCR last night.
&nbsp
I've been binge-watching to catch up.
&nbsp
And you don't have cable because...
&nbsp
Because the government spies on us
through our cable boxes, Brenner.
&nbsp
That's been proven.
&nbsp
And you don't want them to see you
dancin' around
&nbsp
in your underwear for Lady Lisa. I get it.
&nbsp
No, that tape was burned three months ago.
Anyway...
&nbsp
In the middle of the UHF broadcast,
&nbsp
something peculiar interrupted
Sophia Bush's sexy shenanigans.
&nbsp
<i>No, you're the freak with the fat...</i>
&nbsp
<i>Inhabitants of Earth,</i>
&nbsp
<i>we are a race from the planet Volula.</i>
&nbsp
<i>We came to you in these
familiar Earth forms</i>
&nbsp
<i>to tell we received your vessel.</i>
&nbsp
<i>And in it, your hostile challenge.</i>
&nbsp
<i>We accept your offer to compete
in winner-take-all battles.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Gather your bravest warriors
to face our bravest warriors!</i>
&nbsp
<i>The winner takes the loser's planet.</i>
&nbsp
<i>You have already lost the first battle.</i>
&nbsp
<i>And for our victory,
we have taken a trophy.</i>
&nbsp
<i>I'm okay, Mama.</i>
&nbsp
<i>I love you.</i>
&nbsp
<i>That's not the real Madonna!</i>
&nbsp
<i>You will get three lives.</i>
&nbsp
<i>You have two lives left.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Losing both will lead
to the total destruction of your planet.</i>
&nbsp
<i>The next battle is in 15 hours</i>
&nbsp
<i>"at coordinates 27° 24' 79".</i>
&nbsp
Okay, I got lost about halfway through.
&nbsp
Why does Madonna
wanna take over our planet?
&nbsp
These moron aliens think that
the footage NASA sent up to space
&nbsp
of us playing video games in 1982
&nbsp
was a declaration of war.
&nbsp
Intergalactic war, Mr. President.
Isn't that crazy? Isn't that unpredictable?
&nbsp
Lud, listen.
&nbsp
You helped unscramble my Cinemax
when we were kids.
&nbsp
I think you can call me Chewie.
&nbsp
What do they mean by three lives?
What is that?
&nbsp
Uh-huh. If I may. See, that's just it.
&nbsp
It's like the video games of old,
Chewie Mr. President.
&nbsp
One quarter, three lives.
&nbsp
This is clearly not a quarter.
This is far more valuable. May I keep this?
&nbsp
- Put it back on the desk.
- Fair enough.
&nbsp
We lost the first one, <i>Galaga.</i>
&nbsp
Two more losses and...
&nbsp
It's game over.
&nbsp
Now, assuming that...
&nbsp
- You know what, that's not happening.
- Fair enough.
&nbsp
Assuming that Alien Madonna's numbers
are actually latitude and longitude,
&nbsp
then we can safely assume that
the next attack should happen somewhere
&nbsp
in Northern India tonight.
&nbsp
If you can get your guys from the NSA
to clean up the signal,
&nbsp
then we can pinpoint
exactly where the attack is gonna be,
&nbsp
and maybe even which game
they're gonna use to attack us.
&nbsp
- Right?
- I can't authorize a military response
&nbsp
based off a video that looks like
it was made by a couple high school kids.
&nbsp
You gotta at least warn the people of India
somethin' could be comin'.
&nbsp
The whole country thinks
I'm a buffoon right now as it is.
&nbsp
Look, I can't risk it, Brenner.
I just can't!
&nbsp
So I guess we've been dating for almost
three years now.
&nbsp
Yes, almost three.
&nbsp
They have been the best years of my life.
&nbsp
And I think
we have something very special.
&nbsp
Raj, is this what I think it is?
&nbsp
Will you marry me?
&nbsp
Don't sweat the whole Taj Mahal thing.
&nbsp
It's probably better that there's only
an even six Wonders of the World now.
&nbsp
You know what? I get it. I screwed up.
&nbsp
It won't happen again. Shut up.
&nbsp
Good morning, Mr. President.
&nbsp
What's Radio Shack Robbie doing here?
And this other
&nbsp
fella.
&nbsp
Hi. Ludlow Lamonsoff.
&nbsp
We've actually met before,
but you wouldn't remember
&nbsp
because it was in the back of Brenner's van
and I was watching you through a window.
&nbsp
You smell so nice,
like the Book of Genesis.
&nbsp
Mr. Lamonsoff and Mr. Brenner
&nbsp
have agreed to share their video game
expertise with you and your team.
&nbsp
Happy to do it.
&nbsp
With all due respect, sir,
&nbsp
having civilians with zero security
clearance in this facility is...
&nbsp
These civilians have
better insight into our current crisis
&nbsp
than my entire administration.
&nbsp
I dunno if I wanna do it now.
She's being so mean.
&nbsp
- I kind of wanna leave.
- Okay.
&nbsp
- If he leaves, I leave. We're a team.
- Stop it.
&nbsp
- This is how it's gonna be the whole time?
- Guys, knock it off. Lead the way.
&nbsp
Of course, Mr. President.
&nbsp
So have we made any progress, Colonel?
&nbsp
Enormous progress, sir.
&nbsp
We now understand the entities
that attacked us were made of energy.
&nbsp
Intelligent energy.
&nbsp
- Morning, Colonel.
- Good morning, Michael.
&nbsp
Michael's a robot!
&nbsp
I think maybe the extraterrestrials
took what they saw in the orbiter
&nbsp
and recreated the same things
using light energy.
&nbsp
And then sent these light creatures
back at us.
&nbsp
That's why solid matter, bullets
and missiles, won't harm them.
&nbsp
Can anything harm them?
&nbsp
Maybe.
&nbsp
The cubes we recovered in Guam
are normally pretty feisty.
&nbsp
- Hey, look at that!
- Whoa!
&nbsp
Oh, he didn't like it though.
&nbsp
But they calm down pretty quick
&nbsp
when we hit them with
some super-charged light particles.
&nbsp
And the slut-seeking missile,
I'd love to see that.
&nbsp
- Do you have that around here?
- You are so smart.
&nbsp
Yeah? You think so?
&nbsp
Is that how you got into
the Mississippi Institute of Technology?
&nbsp
You know, I wish I never went
in that closet with you.
&nbsp
I was very happy
drinking and crying by myself.
&nbsp
I so regret trying to kiss you.
&nbsp
I would kiss the guy in the yacht 100 times
before I kissed you.
&nbsp
- Moving on.
- Yeah.
&nbsp
We have begun instructing
the Navy SEAL task force
&nbsp
on the use of the prototype weapons.
&nbsp
- What do we train for?
- War!
&nbsp
- Why do we fight?
- To win!
&nbsp
- When do we quit?
- Never!
&nbsp
- What do we train for?
- War!
&nbsp
- Why do we fight?
- To win!
&nbsp
- When do we quit?
- Never!
&nbsp
Perhaps our new expert advisors
would like to say a few words to the SEALs.
&nbsp
Oh, boy.
&nbsp
Men, you have served this nation
with distinction,
&nbsp
in combat zones, in every nook and cranny
of this godforsaken world,
&nbsp
defeating every enemy
they've thrown at you.
&nbsp
Hey, what's up?
&nbsp
Brenner?
&nbsp
- I couldn't get a babysitter.
- Oh.
&nbsp
The President has brought in
these two civilian Arcaders
&nbsp
who we are required to listen to
&nbsp
for 120 seconds,
&nbsp
starting...
&nbsp
I can't do this.
&nbsp
- You can do this.
- Uh, no.
&nbsp
Now!
&nbsp
I can't do this. I'm gonna throw up!
&nbsp
We know how to do this. They don't.
Just act the part.
&nbsp
Hey, guys.
&nbsp
How are you? Hey, thank you, General Zod,
for that beautiful intro.
&nbsp
Hey, uh, fellas. Good to see you.
&nbsp
Um...
&nbsp
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Sam Brenner.
&nbsp
And this is the Wonder Kid,
also known as...
&nbsp
Your worst nightmare!
&nbsp
Looks to me, Brenner,
&nbsp
like someone forgot to send us
the best of the best.
&nbsp
Oops.
&nbsp
And instead,
dropped off a bunch of incontinent,
&nbsp
adult diaper-wearing,
&nbsp
candy-assed, cries-himself-to-sleep,
&nbsp
women-baby-man-people!
&nbsp
What am I lookin' at right now?
&nbsp
Are you guys soldiers?
Or the cast of <i>Magic Mike?</i>
&nbsp
You gonna fight? Or dance naked?
&nbsp
From now on,
&nbsp
you maggots, you little girl maggots...
&nbsp
Whatever the hell
the female form of maggot is.
&nbsp
Magina?
&nbsp
You magina!
&nbsp
When you magina poop your pants,
&nbsp
you're gonna be thinking of me!
&nbsp
In your pants!
&nbsp
You know what I mean.
&nbsp
Do you feel me?
&nbsp
Do you feel me, sailor?
&nbsp
You beautiful Nubian man!
&nbsp
You gorgeous specimen
of what God can make!
&nbsp
Do you feel me?
&nbsp
I think you're about to feel him, Lud.
&nbsp
I can't move.
&nbsp
Lemme help you. Hey, come here.
&nbsp
Sorry. Don't touch the guy. Just sit down.
&nbsp
- Did I do good?
- You did awful.
&nbsp
Sit down.
&nbsp
Sorry about that, everybody.
&nbsp
I know it's weird.
&nbsp
Two buffoons like me and this guy
giving advice to you badasses.
&nbsp
But the truth is we've been training.
&nbsp
Since childhood, we've been training
our prefrontal cortex
&nbsp
to perform extremely complex motor feats
&nbsp
with hand-eye coordination
unique to a very specific cognitive acuity.
&nbsp
I learned a lot of big words
at the dorm-room drug parties.
&nbsp
All of it's been meaningless
in all areas of our life.
&nbsp
But suddenly, it might be comin' in handy
to saving our planet.
&nbsp
So we're hopin' you guys can forget
about us bein' civilian morons,
&nbsp
and let us teach you a few things
in the little time we have.
&nbsp
I think we might help you win this thing.
&nbsp
There is only
one objective in <i>Asteroids.</i>
&nbsp
That is to destroy every rock
and every saucer.
&nbsp
You don't wanna get hit
by any of these boulders.
&nbsp
That's why I recommend
stayin' in the middle.
&nbsp
Just 'cause you see a hammer
doesn't mean grab it.
&nbsp
You're not gonna climb a ladder
with a hammer in your hand.
&nbsp
- Very good.
- Good piloting, Maverick!
&nbsp
Don't lock into radar.
&nbsp
Okay, it's fine, son. It's fine.
&nbsp
You just blew up our entire planet.
&nbsp
Ain't no way Inky's catching up to you!
&nbsp
I want you to focus mostly on the ships.
&nbsp
Every 10,000 points,
you get another triangle ship.
&nbsp
That's a good thing.
&nbsp
Damn.
&nbsp
He's still the master.
&nbsp
This is just like
when we were dating.
&nbsp
- Aw.
- No distractions, just us.
&nbsp
And cake.
&nbsp
Whoa, Big Man. Settle down there
with that butterscotch frosting.
&nbsp
What? Too much? Well, you know what?
&nbsp
You're really not gonna like what I do
with the rainbow sprinkles.
&nbsp
- Come on now! No! I love it!
- Will! No!
&nbsp
Here comes the sprinkle monster!
&nbsp
Mr. President.
&nbsp
Yes, Jennifer.
&nbsp
We just received an alien transmission
from the "Where's the Beef?" lady.
&nbsp
What did she say?
&nbsp
First of all, she asked where the beef was.
&nbsp
Then she said that the next battle
was on at sundown tomorrow.
&nbsp
5130' 29 " latitude. 09' 42" longitude.
&nbsp
Where is that?
&nbsp
Go! Go! Go! Move! Move! Move!
&nbsp
Clear the area!
&nbsp
The lot of ya, come on! Move it!
&nbsp
I said, move it!
&nbsp
- What's all this then, mate?
- Hey, I got this. Hi.
&nbsp
We're Americans.
&nbsp
Our Navy SEALs were given permission
by your government
&nbsp
to prepare for an
extraterrestrial invasion,
&nbsp
which we believe will occur at these
coordinates in approximately 60 minutes.
&nbsp
We're shootin' a beer commercial.
&nbsp
Oh, right, then. Break a leg, then, yeah?
&nbsp
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What was that, man? Why'd you lie to him?
&nbsp
I'm trying not to cause total panic, Yank.
&nbsp
And, you...
&nbsp
I don't want to hear another
word out of you. All right?
&nbsp
You walkin' wiener coat.
&nbsp
What's a wiener coat?
&nbsp
Madam Prime Minister, I can't thank you
enough for your cooperation on this.
&nbsp
But of course, Will.
&nbsp
Well, I trust with the
concord of our powers
&nbsp
we can duff up the jiggery-pokery
of these blighters
&nbsp
and send them scuffering back
&nbsp
to the fractious firmament
from whence they came!
&nbsp
I know, right?
&nbsp
Bang on!
&nbsp
No idea what she just said.
&nbsp
I just wanna touch it.
&nbsp
Easy with those light cannons, gentlemen.
We don't have any backups.
&nbsp
These ray guns gonna work, Van Patten?
&nbsp
We had no way to field-test them, sir.
&nbsp
But our computer models show
a great likelihood of effectiveness.
&nbsp
"Great likelihood"? You're sending my men
into battle with untested ordnance?
&nbsp
I had two days to do things
never done before on this planet, sir.
&nbsp
Just remember who you're talking to, missy.
&nbsp
All right!
&nbsp
Anybody who doesn't need to be here,
follow me to the support area.
&nbsp
That means you two nipple-twisters.
&nbsp
Move it!
&nbsp
Hey, Colonel. Don't worry.
They're gonna work.
&nbsp
<i>The US military was attacked
and what does President Cooper do?</i>
&nbsp
<i>His critics say, "Nothing."</i>
&nbsp
<i>That's not strictly true. He made a cake.</i>
&nbsp
<i>No, because I'm the sprinkle monster!</i>
&nbsp
<i>You are my sprinkle monster!</i>
&nbsp
- Let's put that on pause, Sean.
- Thank you.
&nbsp
Turn it off.
&nbsp
Apologies, Will.
&nbsp
Just wanted to spend some quality time
with the wife.
&nbsp
Oh, I understand.
&nbsp
My husband actually said that we don't
spend time together like we used to,
&nbsp
so I took him to one of those, um,
do-it-yourself pottery studios.
&nbsp
And he made me a "World's Sexiest
Prime Minister" coffee mug.
&nbsp
Well, maybe he sees somethin' that
nobody else does, you know.
&nbsp
Anything, Colonel Van Patten?
&nbsp
It's eerily quiet, Mr. President.
&nbsp
In case it's <i>Space Invaders,</i>
&nbsp
I just thought of something
I should tell...
&nbsp
Please return to the support area!
&nbsp
Okay, but there's a 5 plus 1 formation,
all right?
&nbsp
If we need ya, we know where to find ya.
All right?
&nbsp
Now, bugger off.
&nbsp
Bloody geek.
&nbsp
It's <i>Centipede.</i>
&nbsp
Okay, boys! Do exactly
what we talked about!
&nbsp
Shoot each centipede from the head down!
&nbsp
Do not hit him in the middle
or he will split into two!
&nbsp
No! No!
Didn't we just say don't split him in half?
&nbsp
Shoot for the head!
&nbsp
The mushroom things are in the way!
&nbsp
You shoot the mushroom things!
Like the game!
&nbsp
Guys, every time he hits a mushroom,
he's gonna change direction!
&nbsp
My God! Will you please find the pattern
and anticipate!
&nbsp
I don't know the patterns!
&nbsp
Sergeant Duff! 12 o'clock!
&nbsp
What the hell kind of
beer commercial is this?
&nbsp
If I say it's a beer commercial,
it's a bloody beer commercial.
&nbsp
Get your flabby ass back here, Yank!
&nbsp
Shock and awe, baby!
&nbsp
High score, alien trash!
&nbsp
You messed with the wrong planet!
&nbsp
From Land's End to John o'Groats!
&nbsp
- What the hell are you saying?
- I don't know!
&nbsp
Hey, Ludlow! Grab a light cannon!
Get out here now! I need your help!
&nbsp
Me? No! Look at me! I look delicious!
&nbsp
They'll gobble me up like space dim sum!
&nbsp
It's level two!
&nbsp
We're the only ones who can do this!
&nbsp
Come on! You're the Wonder Kid!
&nbsp
You have no authority
to dispense weapons here, Mr. Brenner!
&nbsp
Mr. President?
&nbsp
Let the nerds take over.
&nbsp
<i>What was that, sir?</i>
&nbsp
Let the nerds take over!
&nbsp
Let the nerds take over!
&nbsp
Brenner's right.
&nbsp
I am the Wonder Kid.
&nbsp
<i>Everyone's watching to
see what you will do.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Everyone's looking at you, oh.</i>
&nbsp
This is the best, huh?
&nbsp
I've never been happier and more alive!
&nbsp
<i>Everyone's trying to get it right.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Get it right.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Everybody's working for the weekend.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Everybody wants a new romance.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Everybody's going off the deep end.</i>
&nbsp
Okay. You can let go of each other now.
&nbsp
<i>Everybody needs a second chance.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Oh.</i>
&nbsp
<i>You want a piece of my heart?</i>
&nbsp
All right, you finish that.
I'll finish this.
&nbsp
It's been 30 years since I kicked your
butt, and it's gonna happen again!
&nbsp
<i>With the arms!</i>
&nbsp
<i>Let's take it forward.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Then take it back.</i>
&nbsp
<i>- Enjoy it!</i>
- Hey!
&nbsp
Come here!
&nbsp
You little...
&nbsp
Who are you, mister?
&nbsp
Son, I'm just a loser
who's good at old video games.
&nbsp
Well, thank God for that.
&nbsp
Drinks are on the US government!
&nbsp
Which is covering up the truth
&nbsp
about the ancient pyramid
under the Hoover Dam!
&nbsp
You know, you're all right, Brenner.
&nbsp
You're all right too, snobby.
&nbsp
You gonna nurse that all night long,
or when are you gonna start hittin' it?
&nbsp
We ding up a few foreign belligerents,
beer is fine.
&nbsp
We defeat a full-on alien invasion,
&nbsp
I'm thinking something a little stronger.
&nbsp
- Mmm-hmm.
- No.
&nbsp
You're really challenging me
to drink you under the table?
&nbsp
- You got it.
- Oh!
&nbsp
I'm not so sure you can, buddy.
&nbsp
I was the vodka shot record holder
in my class at West Point.
&nbsp
Well, one time I drank
15 milkshakes at Denny's,
&nbsp
so we'll see what happens.
&nbsp
Where are my gamers at, huh?
&nbsp
Looks like all the time you wasted
when we were kids is finally payin' off.
&nbsp
- Yeah, baby.
- All right, huh?
&nbsp
Sir, may I have the honor
of pouring you a frosty?
&nbsp
The President can't be seen drinking
during times of crisis.
&nbsp
So nobody look!
&nbsp
That's it. Look away!
&nbsp
<i>Inhabitants of Earth.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Congratulations, you have won this battle.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Please accept one of our warriors
as a trophy of your victory.</i>
&nbsp
Aw.
&nbsp
<i>The next challenge will not be as easy.</i>
&nbsp
<i>The details will be sent
via this signal shortly.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Remember,
we are still leading two battles to one.</i>
&nbsp
<i>One more loss for you
will mean the annihilation of your world.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Good luck and may the best planet win.</i>
&nbsp
Well, you heard 'em.
&nbsp
Let's get back to work.
&nbsp
We gotta get you guys
ready for your next battle.
&nbsp
Battle? Us? Huh?
&nbsp
This is like a regular thing now?
&nbsp
Remember when I told you that
you were meant for something more in life?
&nbsp
Yeah.
&nbsp
This could be it, buddy.
&nbsp
There's nobody better than you.
&nbsp
Well,
&nbsp
not at every game.
&nbsp
No. No! Never gonna happen.
&nbsp
You know, he's right, Brenner.
&nbsp
We don't even know where
to find that idiot!
&nbsp
<i>Eddie Plant.
Married and divorced four times,</i>
&nbsp
<i>declared bankruptcy in 1991 and 2004.</i>
&nbsp
In 2005, he was caught
hacking cell phone companies
&nbsp
and adding one of those fees you see
on your bill every month,
&nbsp
- but have no idea what it is.
- What an idiot.
&nbsp
Made about 50 million
before he was convicted and sentenced
&nbsp
to 20 years in prison.
&nbsp
Guards, get me outta here.
&nbsp
It's that mean Centipede killer.
&nbsp
I hope he don't zap me with his space gun.
&nbsp
How are you, Eddie?
&nbsp
'Sup, Second Place?
&nbsp
Oh! And your sidekick here,
&nbsp
Presi-donut.
&nbsp
I didn't know you can have
an approval rating so catatastrophic.
&nbsp
- Okay, look, Eddie, here's what we need.
- I know what you need.
&nbsp
You need the Fire Blaster.
&nbsp
Who's the Fire Blaster?
&nbsp
Me. That's my nickname, sugar buns.
&nbsp
Oh, yeah. That's right.
The one you made up for yourself.
&nbsp
Yeah. Who cares who made it up?
&nbsp
It's totally tubular!
&nbsp
Yeah.
&nbsp
See, this is why I don't think
I can have Brenner on my team.
&nbsp
He's just not really a gamer.
&nbsp
Break out a bag of quarters. Pick a game.
I'll destroy you at it.
&nbsp
Oh, I'll pick a game, all right.
&nbsp
- Okay. I'm leaving.
- No, no, no. Hey, here, come on.
&nbsp
Sit down.
&nbsp
Okay, in exchange for helping us,
&nbsp
I will personally speak to the parole board
about reducing your sentence.
&nbsp
- Pass.
- Pass?
&nbsp
That deal don't work for Eddie Plant.
&nbsp
You want the Fire Blaster's help,
he has some demands.
&nbsp
Demands?
&nbsp
The Bifocal Blaster is here, by the way.
&nbsp
I want an island.
&nbsp
Oh, my God.
&nbsp
There are 18,617 named islands
&nbsp
that are part of the United States
and its territories.
&nbsp
Not to mention
all the countless unnamed ones,
&nbsp
like the soon-to-be-called Edwahii.
&nbsp
Mmm. You're not getting an island.
&nbsp
Then I want a full pardon.
I wanna get outta here for good.
&nbsp
And after I do,
I don't wanna pay no taxes like,
&nbsp
forever.
&nbsp
And no sales tax.
If I wanna buy some, for instance, gum,
&nbsp
I wanna flash me a card
that says "I saved the world."
&nbsp
I don't have to pay
no shitballs taxes on the gum.
&nbsp
And I want a stealth-attack helicopter,
like they fly over the Super Bowl
&nbsp
at my disposal, at all times.
&nbsp
You know, so I can fly around.
&nbsp
If the world's still here,
I don't wanna deal with traffic no more.
&nbsp
And lastly,
&nbsp
I want you to set up a romantic rendezvous
&nbsp
between me,
Serena Williams and Martha Stewart
&nbsp
in the Lincoln Bedroom.
&nbsp
Number one. You're not getting a helicopter
or any sort of flying or driving vehicle.
&nbsp
Number two.
I'm pretty sure the federal government
&nbsp
could do without your income taxes
and be fine.
&nbsp
And number three.
If you help us beat these things,
&nbsp
I think we can get you outta here.
&nbsp
And the Martha-Serena sandwich?
&nbsp
Pick one of 'em. We'll set up a coffee.
&nbsp
Serena Williams. And we are closed.
&nbsp
Hello?
&nbsp
I understand.
&nbsp
It's happening tonight.
&nbsp
Where?
&nbsp
New York City.
&nbsp
Oh! Fuhgeddaboutit!
&nbsp
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
&nbsp
Hello, Big Apple.
&nbsp
The cavalry has arrived.
&nbsp
Thanks for comin'.
&nbsp
We saw how you guys
took care of the centipedes.
&nbsp
We hope you can do the same for us.
&nbsp
We hope so also.
Well, what are we dealin' with?
&nbsp
Over here.
&nbsp
Rookie, just tell 'em what you saw.
&nbsp
It was awful.
&nbsp
It was like one of those monster movies,
you know?
&nbsp
But this time
&nbsp
the monster was real.
&nbsp
And who was this monster?
&nbsp
Pac-Man.
&nbsp
Pac-Man? Boom. That's my jam.
&nbsp
Let's get us some light cannons
and blow this sucker back
&nbsp
to whatever planet it came from.
&nbsp
No! No, light cannons don't kill Pac-Man.
&nbsp
Those little ghosts do.
&nbsp
Boom! Let's get us some little ghosts.
&nbsp
You want ghosts?
&nbsp
She's got ghosts.
&nbsp
We used the energy force-field technology
from the cube
&nbsp
to develop four mini-generators
for each of the cars.
&nbsp
Ghosts.
&nbsp
We're calling them XM950 attack modules.
&nbsp
Okay and we're callin' 'em Mini Ghosts
&nbsp
'cause we'll never remember
what you just said.
&nbsp
Why are there four of 'em?
There's only three of us. Who's our fourth?
&nbsp
May I introduce to you
Professor Toru Iwatani.
&nbsp
The creator of <i>Pac-Man.</i>
&nbsp
You speak Japanese?
&nbsp
No.
&nbsp
Sir, what an honor.
&nbsp
Thanks for all the joy
you brought to our lives.
&nbsp
Awesome.
&nbsp
I made your game my bitch.
&nbsp
What is a
&nbsp
"bitch"?
&nbsp
Don't worry about it. He's a criminal.
&nbsp
- You all right?
- Yeah.
&nbsp
Okay, now, assuming they play by the rules
of the game like they did with <i>Centipede,</i>
&nbsp
if you guys hit Pac-Man three times
with this energy field, we win.
&nbsp
Ludlow's right. You do smell good.
&nbsp
- Good luck.
- Yeah.
&nbsp
Gentlemen, I'll be sending
Pac-Man's current coordinates
&nbsp
to each of your car's GPSes.
&nbsp
<i>Let's locate and eliminate.</i>
&nbsp
Come on, guys.
&nbsp
Pac-Man's a bad guy?
&nbsp
Pac-Man is not bad!
&nbsp
I created him to bring joy
to all the people of the world.
&nbsp
They have brainwashed him!
&nbsp
Deep down, he's kind, gentle.
&nbsp
Someone you can tell your troubles to
or grab a hamburger with.
&nbsp
You'll see.
&nbsp
Professor Iwatani, get back in the car!
&nbsp
Professor Iwatani, what are you doin'?
&nbsp
I will talk to him. He's my son!
&nbsp
No, that's a bad idea.
&nbsp
Hello,
&nbsp
my sweet little boy.
&nbsp
Look how big you've grown!
&nbsp
I'm so proud of you.
&nbsp
It's so sweet. He's so sweet.
&nbsp
But all these destructive things
you're doing,
&nbsp
it's wrong.
&nbsp
I'm your father.
&nbsp
I know
&nbsp
you're a good boy.
&nbsp
No!
&nbsp
Somebody kill this stupid bitch!
&nbsp
That was some twisted
Pinocchio-Geppetto stuff right there.
&nbsp
All right, losers!
&nbsp
It's three on one.
&nbsp
Let's hit it.
&nbsp
Pac-Man's faster than I remember.
&nbsp
Pac-Man's always been faster
than the ghosts.
&nbsp
We're gonna have to outmaneuver his ass.
&nbsp
<i>Wonderfro,
you and Silver Medal break off.</i>
&nbsp
I'll stay with Big Yellow.
&nbsp
Whoa, Eddie,
how did you do that so fast?
&nbsp
'Cause I'm the champ, Lieutenant Long Legs.
&nbsp
Nope!
&nbsp
What's up?
&nbsp
Oh, yeah!
&nbsp
Good one, Eddie.
&nbsp
<i>One down.</i>
&nbsp
Two to go!
&nbsp
All right, Pac-Man Number Two
&nbsp
just regenerated four streets away
headed northbound.
&nbsp
<i>Turn east at the next intersection.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Brenner, go straight.</i>
&nbsp
Got it.
&nbsp
<i>Ludlow, go left.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Eddie, at the next intersection, turn left.</i>
&nbsp
We got him!
&nbsp
He's got nowhere to go!
&nbsp
Oh, God. No!
&nbsp
"Oh, God. No," what?
&nbsp
He ate the power pellet.
&nbsp
Pac-Man's got 10 seconds
where he can eat us.
&nbsp
Why me?
&nbsp
Oh, God. Don't eat me,
don't eat me, don't eat me.
&nbsp
Please, please, don't eat me!
&nbsp
Guys! Help!
&nbsp
I'm gonna die a virgin!
&nbsp
Why are you doing this to me?
&nbsp
You've been brainwashed!
&nbsp
You're a good boy!
&nbsp
Ludlow, run! Pump your legs! Go, baby!
&nbsp
Attaboy, Eddie!
&nbsp
You just got fire-blasted, sucka.
&nbsp
Uh-huh.
&nbsp
What?
&nbsp
How the hell did he get over there so fast?
&nbsp
Way to go, champ.
&nbsp
Aren't you glad you sprung me,
Second Place?
&nbsp
Yeah, thrilled.
&nbsp
One more to go and it's happy hour.
&nbsp
So I guess they're just leaving me here.
&nbsp
Now it's time for the hat trick.
&nbsp
Wow!
&nbsp
Brenner, it's on you.
&nbsp
There are still three other
power pellets out there.
&nbsp
<i>So stay alert.</i>
&nbsp
I got this.
&nbsp
If I don't,
&nbsp
the world ends.
&nbsp
Can't let that happen.
&nbsp
Come on, Brenner. Come on.
&nbsp
Brenner, he's leading you directly
towards one of the power pellets.
&nbsp
<i>Get out of there.</i>
&nbsp
One.
&nbsp
What the hell is he doing?
&nbsp
Two.
&nbsp
<i>Damn it, Brenner.
I have a son who I'd like to see grow up.</i>
&nbsp
Three. You'll see your boy grow up.
&nbsp
Four.
&nbsp
Brenner, get out! He's going to eat you!
&nbsp
Five.
&nbsp
Six.
&nbsp
Seven.
&nbsp
Eight.
&nbsp
Nine.
&nbsp
Ten.
&nbsp
You did it! Brenner! That's the one, baby!
&nbsp
He's over here!
&nbsp
Fire Blaster, I love you!
&nbsp
Hey, guys!
&nbsp
Sorry. Coming through.
I'm one of tonight's heroes. Sorry.
&nbsp
Hey!
&nbsp
Hey.
&nbsp
Check it out.
&nbsp
I think I might have found our next trophy.
&nbsp
It's Q*bert.
&nbsp
Yeah, I know! I know.
&nbsp
Can I kill it?
&nbsp
No!
&nbsp
Let's get to know him a little bit.
Ask him some questions.
&nbsp
And then we'll kill him.
&nbsp
Huh?
&nbsp
- I'm joking. Just put the blanket on him.
- Bye.
&nbsp
- Mr. President!
- Mr. President!
&nbsp
- Yes, Hal.
- Mr. President,
&nbsp
your approval ratings have tripled
since this crisis began.
&nbsp
Do you feel the heretofore sanguine causata
&nbsp
are tracking toward
an auspicious denouement?
&nbsp
Oh, shut up, Hal.
&nbsp
You're just using big words
to try to make him look like an idiot.
&nbsp
We love you, Mr. President.
Thank you for saving us.
&nbsp
Please, don't thank me.
&nbsp
It's Sam Brenner and his team who have
brought us here to the brink of victory.
&nbsp
<i>And we understand
you're holding a soirée in their honor.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Is that a good idea when another attack
may be imminent?</i>
&nbsp
<i>No need to worry.</i>
&nbsp
They will have their Arcader uniforms on
underneath their tuxes,
&nbsp
ready to go at a moment's notice.
&nbsp
And for the record, Hal,
&nbsp
I happen to know
what several of those big words meant.
&nbsp
I drank a few cold sanguines
on my last trip to México.
&nbsp
Bite on that, Hal!
&nbsp
You! You! You! You! You!
&nbsp
I don't know what would be worse.
&nbsp
Them failing,
&nbsp
or them actually pulling this off.
&nbsp
What was that, Jim?
&nbsp
Can you shut up for five seconds?
&nbsp
We need to increase the rate of fire.
&nbsp
Now you already calculated
that in your beautiful mind, didn't you?
&nbsp
There's no
rhyme or reason to this game.
&nbsp
I mean, where are the patterns?
He just attacks out of left field.
&nbsp
Patterns? Is that why you were so good
with <i>Pac-Man and Centipede?</i>
&nbsp
You memorized the patterns?
&nbsp
Yeah. Only way to beat these things.
&nbsp
Count the bullets, calculate the speed,
crunch the numbers.
&nbsp
Where's the fun in that?
&nbsp
Oh, boy. Why? What do you do?
&nbsp
You gotta pretend you're the guy
and you don't wanna die.
&nbsp
Yeah, that sounds cool,
but it's not gonna work every time.
&nbsp
Well, that's why
you have your reset button.
&nbsp
Yeah, we didn't have those growin' up.
&nbsp
Most violent game I've ever seen.
&nbsp
I don't think it's healthy for you.
&nbsp
It's fine. I can handle it.
&nbsp
No, I'm not talkin' to you.
I'm talkin' to homeboy.
&nbsp
So much blood!
&nbsp
Yeah. Hey. You know what'll cheer you up?
&nbsp
- A cheese ball.
- Yep.
&nbsp
Huh?
&nbsp
Come on, suck one up.
&nbsp
Take a handful.
&nbsp
That was smooth.
That was very smooth.
&nbsp
You know, we should get him some exercise.
&nbsp
Maybe throw him
on the trampoline for a little bit?
&nbsp
Trampoline!
Trampoline! Trampoline!
&nbsp
Okay. How about me and him do that
&nbsp
while you go ask my mom
to the ball tomorrow night?
&nbsp
Unfortunately,
I'm not attracted to your mother.
&nbsp
Bullcrap.
&nbsp
You're right, I am. Okay.
&nbsp
Here. Finish these.
&nbsp
You're gettin' chubby.
&nbsp
Hi.
&nbsp
Hi.
&nbsp
So...
&nbsp
So...
&nbsp
Whoo!
&nbsp
Sorry!
&nbsp
Again! Again! Again! Again!
&nbsp
So I'm feeling obligated to make
an appearance at that thing tomorrow night.
&nbsp
I was wondering, when you got there,
&nbsp
if possibly you'd like to hang out with me
while I was there?
&nbsp
- Like a date?
- Like a date, but...
&nbsp
- Ooh!
- Yeah.
&nbsp
I dunno about that.
&nbsp
I'm a snob. I have mental problems, so...
&nbsp
Well, you know, you are and you do,
&nbsp
but I'm willin' to overlook that
for the evening.
&nbsp
Okay.
&nbsp
- You will?
- Mmm-hmm.
&nbsp
Three, four.
&nbsp
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thanks.
&nbsp
Nice welcome, for a change, huh?
&nbsp
Bring it down, Travolta. Bring it down.
&nbsp
They love the Big Man!
Good to see the respect, pal.
&nbsp
Well, lookie here, Serena.
&nbsp
They threw me a big party to thank me
for savin' the world.
&nbsp
And you get to stand next to me all night.
&nbsp
- Champagne, sir?
- Thanks.
&nbsp
- They promised me an island if I did this.
- Ah.
&nbsp
I'm dying to meet Sam's new ladyfriend.
&nbsp
She's nothin'.
It's just a little hangin' out thing.
&nbsp
Yeah, right.
&nbsp
Is she pretty, Will?
&nbsp
Uh, define pretty.
I mean, you're pretty.
&nbsp
- Extremely pretty.
- Thank you.
&nbsp
She, I think, in the classical sense of the
word, is certainly... I mean, I feel...
&nbsp
- Brenner, help me out here.
- No, you're doing great.
&nbsp
- Keep going.
- Okay.
&nbsp
Uh, You know, she, for
military personnel, certainly.
&nbsp
I mean...
&nbsp
You're the First Lady,
&nbsp
she's a 10.
&nbsp
Hey, Brenner.
&nbsp
Hey, Brenner.
&nbsp
Excuse me for a second.
&nbsp
Come on, Matty. Let's dance!
&nbsp
You look nice in a tux.
&nbsp
Green's officially my favorite color now.
&nbsp
I have a question for you.
&nbsp
President said I'm on call tonight,
so I can only have half a beer.
&nbsp
Um...
&nbsp
I know you like drinkin' out of sippy cups,
&nbsp
but wanna split a bottle with me?
&nbsp
What happened?
&nbsp
- You brushed your teeth.
- Yes! Yes.
&nbsp
All right. Lead the way.
&nbsp
You got it.
&nbsp
<i>Welcome to your life.</i>
&nbsp
<i>There's no turning back.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Even while we sleep.</i>
&nbsp
<i>We will find you.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Acting on your best behavior.</i>
&nbsp
So let's hear about Sinnamon.
What does she look like?
&nbsp
- Oh, God. Are you kidding?
- I wanna know.
&nbsp
She's a husband-stealing Pilates teacher.
She's hot!
&nbsp
- Uh-huh.
- And limber.
&nbsp
That doesn't matter.
&nbsp
Yes! Actually, it does.
&nbsp
She's not perfect, though, right?
&nbsp
Girls like that who steal husbands,
&nbsp
they always got one thing wrong with them.
&nbsp
Come on.
&nbsp
- Her forehead's too big?
- No.
&nbsp
- Mole on the chin?
- No.
&nbsp
- Two different nostrils?
- No!
&nbsp
She's flawless.
&nbsp
She is.
&nbsp
I mean, her eyes.
Okay, her eyes are a little far apart.
&nbsp
Kind of looks like a flounder.
&nbsp
There it is! Good.
&nbsp
So tonight, your dopey ex-husband's gonna
be lookin' into those eyes and sayin',
&nbsp
"What kind of choice did I make?"
&nbsp
"I used to stare into the most
beautiful eyes I've ever seen,"
&nbsp
"and now I'm stuck starin'
at the Filet o' Fish sandwich."
&nbsp
Did you just say I have beautiful eyes?
&nbsp
While insulting the other chick.
&nbsp
Wow. That is really,
really, really, really good.
&nbsp
Thank you.
&nbsp
Can I have some of that? No?
I thought we were splitting it.
&nbsp
Hooyah!
&nbsp
<i>So glad we've almost made it.</i>
&nbsp
<i>So sad they had to fade it.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Everybody wants to rule the world.</i>
&nbsp
<i>They wanna rule.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Why do they act so mean?</i>
&nbsp
You know, everybody's like,
&nbsp
"Brenner this" and "Brenner that."
&nbsp
But make no mistake,
Fire Blaster's the leader of this crew.
&nbsp
Who's the Fire Blaster again?
&nbsp
Me, Serena! All right, lemme
just cut to the chase here.
&nbsp
Fire Blaster's been in
prison for eight years.
&nbsp
He hasn't been with a woman since '05.
&nbsp
You're in for the time of your life.
&nbsp
You even think about touching me,
I'm gonna smack you through the wall.
&nbsp
Mmm. I'd have it no other way.
&nbsp
Should've gone with Martha Stewart.
&nbsp
At least then, I'd have a tasty panini
cooked for me or some shit.
&nbsp
So, what are you gonna do after all this?
&nbsp
You gonna go back to the Nerd Brigade?
&nbsp
Wow.
&nbsp
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
&nbsp
Probably. I mean...
&nbsp
What else would I do?
&nbsp
I mean, it just seems like
someone with your skills,
&nbsp
you'd be better off inventing technology
rather than installing it.
&nbsp
No, of course.
I would love to do somethin' different.
&nbsp
You know, I had my shot
&nbsp
when I was a kid in the arcades.
&nbsp
But
&nbsp
I blew it.
&nbsp
Yeah, I always think maybe my life
would've been different.
&nbsp
Any time I'm getting on a roll,
&nbsp
or I feel like everything's going great,
&nbsp
that giant ape throws another barrel at me.
&nbsp
But it's all good. Don't worry.
&nbsp
Hooyah.
&nbsp
Hooyah.
&nbsp
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am proud to introduce a special message
&nbsp
to the Arcaders from the students of PS 427
&nbsp
in New York City.
&nbsp
<i>New York was in trouble.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Pac-Man caused a ruckus.</i>
&nbsp
<i>But the Arcaders saved us.</i>
&nbsp
<i>'Cause they're bad mother...</i>
&nbsp
<i>People of Earth,</i>
&nbsp
<i>you have violated
the rules of warfare, dudes.</i>
&nbsp
Violated the rules?
&nbsp
<i>Because of this,
you forfeit and your planet is now ours.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Dudes, in 12 hours, we'll commence with
the all-out destruction of Earth.</i>
&nbsp
<i>After that, we will sing this
about your precious planet.</i>
&nbsp
<i>She's gone.</i>
&nbsp
<i>I'd better learn how to face...</i>
&nbsp
What the heck are they talkin' about?
&nbsp
Where you goin', Fire Blaster?
&nbsp
On, hey, kid. Uh...
&nbsp
I told Serena
I needed to get some air, you know?
&nbsp
Only known her half an hour
and she's already like,
&nbsp
"Mrs. Fire Blaster this.
Mrs. Fire Blaster that."
&nbsp
A cop fished these out of the East River
the night you fell in.
&nbsp
I was gonna give 'em back to you,
&nbsp
but I saw some interesting things
written on the inside of the lenses.
&nbsp
The <i>Pac-Man</i> cheat code for super-speed.
&nbsp
- You're a cheater.
- So what?
&nbsp
I used cheat codes back in the day
to help me dominate.
&nbsp
So I figured, why not use it for
the big show. And it worked.
&nbsp
You've been a cheater your whole life?
&nbsp
No.
&nbsp
Only since I was 10.
&nbsp
That's how I beat your boy Brenner
at the World Championship. Oh, yeah.
&nbsp
I owe everything I have
to these bitchin' shades.
&nbsp
What did you do?
&nbsp
I didn't do anything.
I thought we obeyed every rule.
&nbsp
Ya thought wrong, civilian!
&nbsp
We squandered our one chance on you!
&nbsp
A hi-fi repair man.
&nbsp
But I swear...
&nbsp
But nothin'! You heard Hall & Oates!
You blew it!
&nbsp
I've seen your files.
&nbsp
You've never accomplished
a damn thing in your entire life.
&nbsp
Brenner won two battles, Admiral.
That's two more than you.
&nbsp
I wouldn't get
smart with me, Colonel.
&nbsp
You were all over this sideshow that did
nothing but waste valuable time.
&nbsp
Sometimes I wonder if you're not working
for the Martians yourself!
&nbsp
Drop dead, Admiral.
&nbsp
You're done.
&nbsp
All right. Hey, guys! That's enough.
Listen.
&nbsp
We tried something. It didn't work.
&nbsp
What is that?
&nbsp
Matty!
&nbsp
Matty!
&nbsp
I can't believe they took Matty
as a trophy. I am so sorry.
&nbsp
Well, there's gotta be somethin' we can do.
&nbsp
Where's Eddie?
&nbsp
Eddie. Yeah. He crawled into a hole.
We'll never see him again.
&nbsp
Chewie won't take my calls.
&nbsp
Violet got the boot.
We're on our own, guys.
&nbsp
This feels like my planet.
&nbsp
No fun. No laughter. Only war.
&nbsp
Wait.
&nbsp
Wait a second. Q*bert is from there.
He knows all their secrets.
&nbsp
We were once a happy planet.
&nbsp
Before you threatened us.
&nbsp
But we didn't threaten you!
You saw footage of old games.
&nbsp
They do not know they are games.
&nbsp
Well, why don't you tell them that, Q*bert,
and stop them?
&nbsp
It's too late.
&nbsp
And now the mothership is creating
millions of video-game warriors
&nbsp
to destroy your planet.
&nbsp
Look, all we have to do is get inside
the mothership and try to stop them.
&nbsp
We can rescue Matty while we're up there.
&nbsp
Up there. You wanna go up there?
&nbsp
I don't know about that.
You know, they took away our light cannons.
&nbsp
I don't think that's such a good idea.
&nbsp
We have something better
than light cannons.
&nbsp
We have a positive can-do attitude.
&nbsp
Ah.
&nbsp
I'm kidding. We are all gonna die.
&nbsp
I'm just...
&nbsp
Sorry.
&nbsp
Are you sure we wanna do this?
&nbsp
I mean, maybe we could just find
another planet to live on.
&nbsp
Shut up, dude.
We're gettin' on that ship.
&nbsp
And the only way to do that is
to get directly under it.
&nbsp
That's the only way in.
&nbsp
Oh!
&nbsp
Arcaders are comin'! Don't worry!
&nbsp
Come on! Come on! Come on! Go!
&nbsp
Stay with me!
&nbsp
Nobody's better at the crane game than me.
&nbsp
Chewie?
&nbsp
What's with the disguise, buddy?
&nbsp
They tried to take me
to some underground bunker,
&nbsp
so I went rogue.
&nbsp
Oh, yeah!
&nbsp
Wonder Kid, you gotta stay on the ground.
These people need protection.
&nbsp
Oh, thank God.
&nbsp
Hey, live long, laugh much, love often.
&nbsp
Yeah.
&nbsp
That's it.
&nbsp
No.
&nbsp
Back it up.
&nbsp
Thanks for bein' my friend.
&nbsp
'Course, buddy. I love ya.
&nbsp
Now go kick some ass.
&nbsp
Mr. President, may I have a light cannon?
&nbsp
<i>La la la la la la
Sing a happy song.</i>
&nbsp
Ooh.
&nbsp
<i>La la la la la la.</i>
&nbsp
Don't tell anyone I killed a Smurf.
&nbsp
Hey!
&nbsp
Get away from those kids now!
&nbsp
Please?
&nbsp
Hey!
&nbsp
I spent most of my formative years
&nbsp
trying to figure out a
way to bring you to life
&nbsp
all Weird Science-style.
&nbsp
I used every birthday wish,
&nbsp
every 11:11 on the clock,
&nbsp
every little chicken wishbone I could find,
and ladybug.
&nbsp
I prayed for this.
&nbsp
Oh.
&nbsp
But apparently, you don't feel the same.
&nbsp
Okay. We're
under it, Q*bert. Now what?
&nbsp
<i>Well, well, well.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Look who's here.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Q*bert the traitor</i>
&nbsp
<i>and his cheating friends.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Come to beg for a second chance?</i>
&nbsp
<i>You're in luck.
The boss wants to meet ya in person.</i>
&nbsp
<i>So come on up!</i>
&nbsp
<i>If you defeat him, you save your planet
and destroy our warriors.</i>
&nbsp
<i>But if you lose...</i>
&nbsp
See you on the other side.
&nbsp
You are so powerful, just as I...
&nbsp
You win!
I'm not gonna fight you anymore, okay?
&nbsp
I know that you have love in your heart,
&nbsp
and I know that I could make you happy,
but if you need to kill me,
&nbsp
then you're just gonna have to go ahead
and kill me.
&nbsp
At least I can die a happy man
knowing that I found true love.
&nbsp
And I couldn't even get a handshake
from Serena Williams.
&nbsp
Well, well, well.
&nbsp
Didn't think I'd see you again.
&nbsp
I had to prove to myself and to the world
that I could do this without cheating.
&nbsp
Wait, you cheated?
&nbsp
Moving on.
&nbsp
You gonna introduce me to your girlfriend?
&nbsp
Fiancée.
&nbsp
Where are we, Q*bert? What is this place?
&nbsp
I don't know.
&nbsp
But I'm scared.
&nbsp
Great.
&nbsp
What is that noise?
&nbsp
What the hell was that?
&nbsp
Donkey Kong.
&nbsp
The one game you suck at.
&nbsp
Yeah.
&nbsp
Mom, up here!
&nbsp
Matty!
&nbsp
Mom!
&nbsp
Where the hell is my mama?
&nbsp
We're coming for you, honey!
&nbsp
Oh, no.
&nbsp
There's too many of them!
&nbsp
This way!
&nbsp
Only one way to beat this game. Jump!
&nbsp
Up the ladder! Fast!
&nbsp
Incoming!
&nbsp
Oh!
&nbsp
Q*bert! Look out!
&nbsp
Oh!
&nbsp
Q*bert!
&nbsp
I can't do this.
There's no pattern.
&nbsp
Pretend you're the guy
and you don't wanna die.
&nbsp
I don't wanna die!
&nbsp
I couldn't even beat Eddie Plant!
&nbsp
Eddie Plant's a cheater!
That's why he was so good in New York.
&nbsp
He used cheat codes.
&nbsp
<i>He did the same thing to you
when you were kids.</i>
&nbsp
<i>You know what that means, right?</i>
&nbsp
I'm the <i>Donkey Kong</i> champion of the world.
&nbsp
And the <i>Donkey Kong</i> champion of the world
doesn't need patterns.

&nbsp
<i>Buddy you're a boy make a big noise.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Playing in the street

&nbsp
<i>You got mud on your face.</i>
&nbsp
Freeze, Chewie!
&nbsp
<i>Kickin' your can all over the place.</i>
&nbsp
<i>- Singin '

&nbsp
Brenner!
&nbsp
<i>We will, we will rock you.</i>
&nbsp
Mom, Mom! Q*bert's not dead!
&nbsp
Help me! Help me!
&nbsp
Nah, I'm pretty sure he's dead, Matty.
&nbsp
Mom!
&nbsp
Please.
&nbsp
Okay, fine.
&nbsp
What? No!
&nbsp
No!
&nbsp
<i>We will rock you</i>
&nbsp
Violet, get outta there!
&nbsp
Look out!
&nbsp
<i>We will, we will rock you.</i>
&nbsp
We're trapped!
&nbsp
<i>We will, we will rock you.</i>
&nbsp
Brenner!
&nbsp
<i>We will, we will rock you.</i>
&nbsp
<i>We will, we will rock you.</i>
&nbsp
Here, grab onto my mighty hammer.
&nbsp
You loved saying that.
&nbsp
Yes, I did.
&nbsp
Brenner!
Whatever you're doing, please hurry up!
&nbsp
I've been waitin' to do this since 1982.
&nbsp
Yeah!
&nbsp
Yeah! Yes!
&nbsp
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
&nbsp
Matty! Oh, God!
&nbsp
- You okay?
- Yeah.
&nbsp
You were so awesome down there!
&nbsp
You're my second favorite president.
You know Obama's still my man, right?
&nbsp
Oh, okay.
&nbsp
Hey! We won!
&nbsp
No more taxes!
&nbsp
We did it, baby!
&nbsp
We did it.
&nbsp
No.
&nbsp
No. No!
&nbsp
Lady Lisa!
&nbsp
No!
&nbsp
Eddie, never thought I'd see you again.
&nbsp
Brenner, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for
cheatin' back in the day when we was kids,
&nbsp
and for cheatin' again
more recently.
&nbsp
I'm not goin' back to
prison for that, am I?
&nbsp
No, but you need to admit to Brenner
that he's the best in the world.
&nbsp
Eh, no way.
&nbsp
Prison.
&nbsp
Brenner,
&nbsp
you are the best
&nbsp
in the world
&nbsp
at the <i>Donkey Kong.</i>
&nbsp
That's right. I am.
&nbsp
Ludlow. What's the matter, buddy?
&nbsp
I finally had the one thing I wanted
&nbsp
and now I'm back to being all alone.
&nbsp
Lady Lisa, she made an appearance.
&nbsp
And while you guys were out, you know,
savin' the world, you kind of destroyed his.
&nbsp
Oh, that's horrible.
&nbsp
It's just, how come he gets to stay?
Why are you still here?
&nbsp
I'm sorry.
&nbsp
Q*bert's a trophy.
&nbsp
And I guess we get to keep the trophies.
&nbsp
Yeah.
&nbsp
Aw.
&nbsp
Q*bert, what is it?
&nbsp
Aw.
&nbsp
Wait, no one else is weirded out by this?
That was just Q*bert.
&nbsp
- Mr. President! Please!
- Yes, Renee.
&nbsp
Mr. President, are we out of danger?
&nbsp
<i>Yes. In fact, I am pleased to announce.</i>
&nbsp
<i>I have brokered a peace treaty
with the alien invaders.</i>
&nbsp
<i>This peace is due to, and only due to</i>
&nbsp
<i>the bravery of the Arcaders,</i>
&nbsp
<i>who, against all odds,
stepped up and saved us all.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Eddie Plant,</i>
&nbsp
<i>Ludlow Lamonsoff,</i>
&nbsp
<i>Sam Brenner,</i>
&nbsp
<i>and Lieutenant Colonel Violet Van Patten</i>
&nbsp
<i>are American heroes.</i>
&nbsp
<i>World heroes.</i>
&nbsp
Yeah!
&nbsp
"World hero"?
I guess you're not a nerd anymore.
&nbsp
You don't want me to
stop being a nerd, ever.
&nbsp
Why is that?
&nbsp
'Cause like I said,
nerds are the greatest kissers.
&nbsp
I'll be the judge of that.
&nbsp
<i>Mother told me Yes, she told me.</i>
&nbsp
<i>That I'd meet girls like you.</i>
&nbsp
<i>She also told me.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Stay away
You'll never know what you'll catch.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Just the other day I heard
of a soldier's falling off.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Some Indonesian junk that's going round.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Mommy's all right, daddy's all right.</i>
&nbsp
<i>They just seem a little weird.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Surrender, surrender.</i>
&nbsp
<i>But don't give yourself away.</i>
&nbsp
<i>Hey, hey.</i>
&nbsp
Hey, kids. Daddy's home.
&nbsp
- Daddy!
