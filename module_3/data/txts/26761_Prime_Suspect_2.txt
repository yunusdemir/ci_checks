your full name and date of birth.
Robert Oswalde.
13th of August...
1961.
It´s the police!
Excuse me, please!
We´re laying new drains.
I think it´s covered in polythene.
So, she consented to sex with you?
She was begging for it, man!
If she was willing,
why did you use violence?
You know how these things happen.
No, I don´t know.
Some of them white thing,
them like it rough, you know!
Jesus, Frank, what is it with you
and red lights?
Have the Pakis murdered someone?
Shut your mouth and move that bike.
Nobody talk to him like that!
We live here, not you!
- Are you in charge?
- Yes, sir, for the time being.
Then, please, take it away.
We will, sir, as soon as possible.
Not "as soon as possible" - now!
I pay my poll tax.
It´s a suspicious death, sir.
All this has to be done properly.
Can you go with this officer, please?
I´ve just got to ask a few questions.
How did you know
that this girl wanted it "rough"?
I knew. The way she look.
Well, how did she look?
She had blonde hair...
...and she was wearing a red blouse.
And a tight, tight, black skirt,
like for you.
So she didn´t actually
say anything to encourage you?
But then, you did ram
her tights down her throat.
It´s just her word against mine.
It´s the doctor´s reports and
forensic evidence and her word!
How many other women have you attacked?
How long before you kill someone?
Kernan! If that is my Simone
that´s in there...
Nola, I´ve just arrived. Give me a chance
to find out what´s happening.
We won´t be issuing any statements tonight.
Now, go home.
You should all just go home!
You never did try to find my daughter!
You people should go home!
If it´s my Simone,
you can´t stop us from going into her.
Cordon it off properly. If it is Simone Cameron,
we´ve got a real problem.
Are Forensics here yet?
Yeah, they´re waiting for you, guv.
Were these slabs in place
when you bought the house?
- Of course, yes.
- You haven´t done any work yourself?
I´m telling you, no.
- Thank you.
- Down here, sir!
Right. Let´s take a dekko.
- Look ´pon her now.
- Sit down please, Robert.
She love it. Cock teaser, innit?
What she say I did to that bitch
is just turning her on.
Sit down, please, Robert.
The thought of a woman being humiliated
doesn´t turn me on.
Someone being frightened half to death.
But that turns you on, doesn´t it?
It must do.
Why else force yourself on someone?
You´re a very attractive man.
How tall are you?
- 6´4".
- Oh, really?
Well, I´m sure a lot of women do fall for you.
But not this one.
- Some women say no when they mean yes.
- Ah! So she said no to you?
- I said "some women".
- She said no?
- I´ve nothing to say.
- That´s not begging for it.
- Bullshit! She put words in my mouth.
- Now let me ask you this.
- That´s a good place to stop.
- I haven´t finished yet.
Unfortunately, we´ll have to,
since it´s well after six.
Unbelievable!
Excellent, though I would just add
one word of warning.
Some of DCI Tennison´s
more unconventional questions
might get a less-experienced officer
into difficulties.
Remember, under PACE, no attempt
may be made to bully or threaten a suspect.
Finally, well done DS Oswalde,
for playing his part so convincingly.
And finally, tomorrow´s first sessión
will be on interviewing the victims of rape.
See you all at ten o´clock.
- You´re too good at that, Detective Sergeant.
- T´ank you, ma´am.
- Are you having a drink later on?
- Maybe. Or I might have an early night.
Might see you, then.
Looks like it´s a female, Oscar.
Oh, yes? What makes you say that, Mr Gold?
It´s wearing a bra.
Oh, God. That´s all we need.
Tony, take over till Tennison gets here.
- But she´s still on that course, guv.
- Not any more, she´s not.
Oh, great.
Already?
Yeah. Now what was it you were saying
about white women liking it rough?
Hey, that wasn´t me. I don´t think like that!
Oh, I know, I´m sorry.
Hey...
Know what I´d like to do now?
What?
Drink the entire contents of the minibar.
Why?
Dunno, I just feel like it.
OK. What would you like first?
Champagne.
Right.
Oh, God... That´s Dame Sybil.
Don´t make a sound.
Hello?
Hello, guv.
About two hours. Why?
Right.
OK.
OK. See you. Bye.
- What´s wrong?
- That was my guv. He wants me back.
- Now.
- What?
Yeah, he wants me to head a murder inquiry.
I´ll have to tell Thorndike.
Damn, it´s my lecture tomorrow!
- Look, sod Thorndike.
- Sorry, but there´s nothing I can do about it.
I know that.
What´s your problem, then?
- What about us?
- What about us?
I see.
Bob, I´m not saying
I don´t want to see you again.
Aren´t you?
Come on, this is hard enough as it is.
I hear you. OK? The Detective Chief Inspector
has given her orders.
What did you expect?
That´s unfair.
It´s not as if the love of your life is walking out.
I don´t like being treated like some black stud.
- Is that what you think´s been going on?
- Yes, I do.
Well, that´s in your head.
Is it?
I think you´d better go.
Don´t worry. I´m going.
I hope I can rely on you to be discreet.
You really are something else, aren´t you?
Bitch.
I don´t know anything about rape victims.
Then it´s time you did.
Attitudes like that mean only 8% of rapes are
ever reported. There are my notes.
It´ll be a help but it´s bloody annoying.
- What can I do, David?
- Isn´t another DCI available?
Yes, but Kernan wants me.
Why?
Maybe he thinks I´m a good detective.
But why this specific investigation?
The body was found in Honeyford Road
where the Cameron family still live.
It could be Simone Cameron.
Politically sensitive, certainly.
A word of advice.
Charges may be brought against the officers
in the Derrick Cameron case,
if it goes to the Court of Appeal.
Quite right too, if that boy was fitted up.
What are you getting at?
I´d be careful, if I were you.
This may not turn out to be such a prize for you.
- Obviously, you´re a liberated woman.
- Oh, thank you, David!
But don´t be too trusting
of our Afro-Caribbean friend.
That´s your advice, is it?
Good luck tomorrow.
Oh, and drive carefully if you´ve been drinking.
OK, ma´am.
Nola!
Go on home!
Not if it´s my Simone.
I don´t want to lose her a second time.
Natural plant fibre such as cotton
disintegrates and forms part of the diet
of the early inhabitants of the corpse.
But wool, like hair - they may be the same -
can be remarkably resilient.
How old do you think she is, Oscar?
She was still growing.
Still in her teens, I´d say.
How long before a corpse gets like this?
- That I can´t tell yet.
- Oh, come on, Oscar! Minimum time?
Two years? Don´t quote me on that.
So it could be Simone.
You see, you´re doing it already.
When were these garden slabs laid?
Before the Viswandhas came here.
About 18 months ago.
Who did they buy the house from?
He named some property developer.
Have these slabs been disturbed since then?
- Not according to the workmen, no.
- So she was buried before they were laid.
Our prime suspect has to be
whoever lived here when she was buried.
We need a definite date of death.
Is there any of that soup left?
Oh, if there is, could you get some out
to Nola Cameron? She´s still out there.
The rest of you go home.
I´ll aim to have a briefing at 10am.
Right, guv.
Can you get a shot of that for me?
Hands tied together at the back with...
...a leather belt.
Just a minute, madam.
My daughter, Simone! Simone!
- Simone!
- It´s all right.
Simone!
It was all arranged weeks ago.
I´d go with the CLO.
I can´t back out now, but it´ll be a nightmare.
I want you to be there.
Community centre, starts at eight.
- No thanks, I´m trying to give up.
- Christ! Since when?
Six days, five hours, and... about 15 minutes.
The meeting is supposed to be
about community policing,
but given what´s happening,
we´ll be dragged through the shit
about the Cameron family.
Phelps is coming down tonight.
He´s bound to have the media in tow.
- He can smell a vote-winner for 50 miles.
- Let´s face it, guv.
Nola may be jumping to conclusions,
but we can´t claim
to have done well by her family.
- Not if Derrick was fitted up.
- Let´s concentrate on the immediate problem.
- Is it the Cameron girl or not?
- I don´t know.
I won´t get anything from Oscar Bream
till tomorrow.
Yep?
Yes, I´ll hold.
If we could find out before tonight´s meeting,
our lives would be a lot easier.
I´ll talk to Forensics. And I want that garden
dug up in case there are any more bodies.
Christ, what do you want -
another Nilsen? Sir!
That´s right.
I thought she was
the very best person for the job.
It requires tact and...
I´m sure she´ll be able to cope.
I will do.
Goodbye.
Now, how in hell does the Commander know
what happened on your course already?
What do you mean?
That I brought you back to lead this inquiry.
Well, I´ll give you one guess,
and it involves funny handshakes.
- Thorndike? Same lodge?
- I´d put my money on it.
Make sure you vindicate my decisión.
I´ll do my best, sir.
We need a name for this operation.
Where are we up to in the A to Z?
I think it´s "N", guv.
Look up the first "N" for us,
then, would you?
No way, I am not opening a book.
We could all earn a few quid.
Because last time I was £75 out of pocket!
You know why that was, don´t you?
You talked me into it!
Right, as some of you are aware,
workmen digging in the back garden
of 15 Honeyford Road
have uncovered skeletonised human remains.
The hands were tied behind the back
and the body wrapped in polythene,
so it´s definitely a suspicious death.
Some of you will be aware
there´s a lot of speculation going on in the area
that it could be Simone Cameron,
a local girl who went missing a few years ago.
Put that up for me, Jonesy.
Her mother Nola, who still lives near number 15,
is completely convinced that it´s Simone.
I´ll get the forensic boys and the pathologists
to answer that as soon as possible.
But in the meantime, we´ve got to take
Nola Cameron´s fears seriously.
Unfortunately, the Cameron family have been
the centre of attention for some time now.
The eldest boy, Derrick Cameron -
remember him?
He was accused
of stabbing a white youth to death.
He was sent to prison on the basis
of a confessión made here in this nick in 1985.
Now there are doubts cast
upon the safety of that conviction.
In fact, a campaign led by Jonathan Phelps,
Labour´s by-election candidate,
to bring Derrick´s case before the Court
of Appeal, is gaining a lot of support.
- So there´s a lot of anger against the police.
- There always is.
We always take the brunt.
We can rule out the present owners.
So our priority is to find all former residents
of number 15.
- Let´s get down there straight away.
- Passports at the ready!
That´s out of order! Have you been listening?
I don´t want the Camerons, not even
the uncles and aunts, interviewed at all.
As far as the other residents go, if we go in there
expecting aggro, start leaning on people,
well, we´ll get it. So it´s easy does it.
- You´re graduates of the Rank Charm School.
- Except Frank!
I want a list of all former residents
of the Honeyford Road area
- for the last ten years.
- Ten years?
DS Haskons is our office manager.
- Does he get a hat?
- Tony, have you got a name for us?
The first "N" is Nadine St, guv.
Nadine, very nice. So it´s Operation Nadine.
Nadine, is it you?
All right, come on, let´s go. Jonesy!
Go on, love. Run along. Quick!
I´ll get all this stuff bagged up
for you as soon as possible,
so you can get Mrs Cameron to look at it.
Pullover remains.
Bra.
Label from her jeans.
Pants.
Trainers.
And so on. Not very helpful.
I´ve got a pair of those. Not cheap.
Looks like a piece of skull.
Send it over to Bream.
Adidas.
But we have found several coins,
the most recent of which is 1986.
But most promisingly so far,
the belt that secured her hands behind her back.
Very distinctive buckle.
Could have belonged to her, I suppose.
Or the killer.
Morning. Local CID.
Good morning. DC Lillie, local CID.
We´re investigating
a suspicious death in this area.
Excuse me.
Jesus Christ, here we go.
Shut your mouth!
Now, calm down! Calm down! Relax!
You wouldn´t wear them for tennis.
They´d do your ankles in.
What have we got on the property developer?
Has since gone bankrupt and disappeared.
Jane, a word.
Yeah, in a minute, guv.
My office. Now!
Kernan the Barbarian!
Burkin has just arrested
a young black lad for possessión.
Oh, God!
He´s doing his bloody house-to-house,
smells a spliff and barges in!
Pulls the lad out by the scruff of the neck.
I don´t believe it.
So now we´ve got bricks
thrown into the garden at number 15,
a reception full of people bleating on about
infringement of civil liberties
and police harassment!
With this bloody meeting,
I just don´t believe it!
Shall I take Burkin off this inquiry?
We can´t do that, Jane.
I´m up for promotion.
Promotion?
Chief Super. Right now,
I can´t afford to do my dirty washing in public.
My interview would be a nightmare.
I hope you´ll be recommending me
for your post?
Oh, do you?
Don´t take too much for granted.
Now, get this boy cautioned and released
and tear bloody Burkin up for arse paper!
Guv, he was blatant, almost blowing the smoke
in my face, as if to say, "Nick me."
That´s not the point.
What with the Cameron case...
- Cameron´s a villain, deserves to be banged up!
- Frank!
So he had to be leaned on to confess.
So what?
So what?
So our reputation goes down the toilet!
What reputation? They hate us!
I ain´t so keen on them.
One less on the streets isn´t no loss.
You´re making a fool of yourself.
If they don´t want to be part of our country,
why don´t they go home?
That´s enough, Frank! Just shut it!
An outburst like that again,
it´ll be a disciplinary matter.
Yeah? Then perhaps you´d better
take me off the case.
You won´t be off the case, Frank.
You´ll be off the force.
If you think fitting someone up cos
they´re black is OK, you shouldn´t be Old Bill.
Yeah. I´ll be right there.
Jesus, this is a murder investigation!
A young girl finishes up buried
in someone´s back yard like the family cat,
her skull smashed to pieces.
What difference does her skin colour make?
I want that boy cautioned and
released, and then get back to work.
This way, Nola.
Look at these things, and tell me
if any of them belonged to Simone.
Yes, they are all her things.
Nola. Take your time.
Look at them carefully.
<i>Yes. These are her things.</i>
We found this belt buried with her.
Do you recognise that?
Yes. This is her belt.
She always wore this belt.
I see.
And what about this watch?
That is hers.
I bought her this watch!
Do you want to sit down,
would you like a cup of tea?
No, thank you.
The experts will give us more information soon.
Your dentist has supplied
Simone´s dental records.
We can compare those,
and then we´ll know absolutely for sure.
Until then, I´m afraid these things
are all we have got to go on.
Are you sure you recognise all of them?
Oh, yes.
- Oh, yes.
- I see.
Thank you very much.
A report just in from Gold.
He reckons Nadine´s body
was infested with maggots. Bluebottles.
So?
Bluebottles won´t lay eggs underground.
So she was above ground
before she was buried?
At least a few hours.
And she must have been killed in the summer,
because that´s when the flies are active.
And Simone went missing in February.
So when I go into this meeting tonight,
I´m none the bloody wiser.
I want Derrick Cameron´s case
to reach the Court of Appeal,
so that someone who´s been wrongly
imprisoned for six years is released.
The Police and Criminal Evidence Act
brought in stricter safeguards
for the interrogating of suspects,
but that was not much help to Derrick Cameron.
If that means a no-go area...
- If that means a no-go area, then...
- With respect...
...I can´t make any such assurance.
We don´t want to create no-go areas.
We´ve heard
from your Community Liaison Officer,
who is, of course, a white police officer...
That´s a racist remark, isn´t it?
...about sensitive policing, community policing.
Yet once again, local people
are being treated as second-class citizens.
If you are talking
about our current investigation...
- I am.
- ...then it is being carried out...
In a hostile...
...in a hostile and intimidatory manner,
with violent arrests being made by your officers,
though no charges were brought.
One of my officers
was provoked into making an action
which in retrospect can be seen as being hasty.
Look, the most important thing is,
there´s a murderer out there walking free.
We have to find that person.
To do that, we need the help of this community.
Afterwards, myself and three of my colleagues
will be staying behind,
in the hope you can give us
some crucial information.
For example, who was staying
at 15 Honeyford Road before the Viswandhas?
We know that!
He left when Simone went missing!
Please, Mrs Cameron...
Please!
What was his name? Somebody!
I would like to ask Mr Kernan
about the heavy police presence
in the Honeyford Road area at the moment.
I´d like to ask him how
he´s got the front to come here in the first place,
when Derrick Cameron´s banged up
for something he didn´t do!
Let him answer!
I cannot discuss the details of that case,
but I would have thought my presence here is
indication of good faith.
The justifiable anger and unhappiness
at what has happened to Derrick Cameron...
cannot be so easily dismissed by a police officer
stationed at Southampton Row.
- I´m not dismissing...
- This is the fundamental question!
Is it possible to expect justice in this country...
if you are a person of colour?
Allen. A-L-L-E-N.
Listen, I don´t like the police.
Thank you.
But I tell you this, you should talk to the guy
that Nola mentioned.
- Yeah?
- White guy about 50. Worked as a builder.
Can you give me his name, sir?
We argued about parking space.
And in the morning
all my car was covered in brake fluid.
But don´t worry, I got my own back.
Go on, then, tell me.
I pissed in his petrol tank!
Dave Hardy or Hartley. Something like that.
Word is a family called Allen lived at No.13.
They might have owned No.17 as well.
Esme Allen still runs a West Indian takeaway
which is nearby.
Great. Give it another half an hour here,
and then call it a day.
My son study for his school exam,
my daughter Sarah study law at university.
Them think the worid´s at them feet.
They´ll never scrub floor or take out rubbish!
Let´s hope
they don´t come down to earth with a bump!
Mrs Esme Allen?
Yes, dear?
I´m DCI Jane Tennison.
It´s not bad news? Has someone
been hurt? Sarah? Tony?
It´s OK.
We´re just making some inquiries.
My Lord! You gave me a fright!
Is it about that poor Cameron girl?
Yes, that´s right. In a way it is.
Is there somewhere more private?
Take the lady downstairs.
I´ll look after the shop.
All right. Come this way.
I understand that in the ´80s, you and your
husband used to own No.15 Honeyford Road.
Yes, that´s right.
But you lived at No.17 with your family.
Yes.
I´m sorry to tell you this, but a body has been
found buried in the back garden of No.15.
My God.
So we´re very anxious
to trace the former occupant.
You think he killed poor Simone?
We just want to eliminate him from our inquiries.
What was his name?
David Harvey.
And do you have any idea where he lives now?
No. My husband might know, but...
We tried not to have anything to do with him.
I wouldn´t let my daughter go near that house.
We all knew what he was like,
particularly with young giris.
He wasn´t always like that,
but after his wife died...
I thought they were a lovely couple,
but after she´d gone,
drinking and cursing and, you know, carrying on.
I´d better speak to your husband
and whole family as soon as possible.
- Yes. We´ll all be there this evening.
- Fine, thank you.
It´s Harvey. Not Hardy, not Harley. Harvey.
H- A-R-V-E-Y.
We´ve got to start again.
I´m going to see Oscar Bream.
It makes a pleasant change, not being
up to the armpits in someone´s viscera.
Though this girlie is sorely taxing
my memory of anatomy classes.
There are 206 named bones of the body.
26 to each foot for a kick-off.
Luckily, most of those
were still inside her plimsolls.
Fascinating, Oscar, but is it Simone Cameron?
Absolutely not.
What?
As I said,
like Simone, in her teens, 15 to 16, but taller.
Simone was 5´7". This girl is 5´8", 5´9".
It looks as if she was all there,
no mutilation. Good head of hair.
Luckily, Paul here likes jigsaws.
Bit of the zygomatic arch?
Are you sure that it´s not Simone?
Yeah.
Want me to point out the differences?
No, thank you.
Fractured her wrist when she was younger.
Playing netball? Fell off her bike?
That´s for you to discover.
Don´t rub it in.
Do you know if she´s black or white?
- No.
- Shit!
I´ve been going up a dead end.
We´ve got a man who can do jiggery-pokery
with the skull to ascertain ethnic origins.
Better still, a medical artist
who could make you a clay head at a price.
Is he good?
He´s our very own Auguste Rodin.
Yeah, but is he good?
Naturellement.
That´s expensive, right?
Do you want to put it to Kernan?
- No, sod it. Let´s do it.
- OK.
How long before I get it?
- Three weeks?
- Fine.
I´ll pick it up in three days.
I´ll talk to him.
Perhaps if you were prepared to model nude?
That´s sexual harassment.
What isn´t these days?
How did she die, Oscar?
No idea.
The skull could have been smashed after death.
For all I know, she could have been buried alive.
DA Harvey.
No, Harvey. That´s H-A-R-V-E-Y.
When can you confirm it?
Yeah, it´s just I´m trying...
I´m gonna do some myself.
Have you got anything for me?
Nothing so far, boss.
But we´ve got more stuff from No.15.
Jonesy´s getting it.
Let´s hope it´s good, then.
Right, listen up. I´ve just come
from Oscar Bream at the path lab.
It´s definitely not Simone Cameron.
So we operate on two fronts:
Find David Harvey and identify "Nadine".
It´s a bottle of Scotch
for whoever gets David Harvey.
Guv. They found a plastic bag buried, as well.
Gold has definitely linked it to the girl.
It contained this.
The cloth is West African. Several yards of it.
And those ivory bracelets are Nigerian.
Yoruba amulets, supposed to ward off
evil spirits. Didn´t work for "Nadine".
They´re very old and very valuable
May I talk to Esme, your mum?
Yes, please wait here.
Mum, someone´s at the door for you.
Hello, it´s Jane Tennison.
Yes, come in.
This way.
This is my son Tony.
Hello, Tony.
And his daughter Cleo. Say hello, Cleo.
Hello.
Tony and his girlfriend
are doing the decent thing at long last.
Their daughter is to be a bridesmaid.
Lord, how times have changed!
You wanted to see my husband?
Yes, please. Thank you.
So when´s the happy day, Tony?
Uh...
Do you like my dress?
Yes, I do.
I think that´s lovely.
Tony, just a minute.
Could you have a look at this for me, please?
That´s a description of the dead girl.
Do you remember seeing anyone like that
in this area in the mid ´80s?
- She might have been at school with you.
- I´m a bridesmaid.
You are, aren´t you?
Have you ever been a bridesmaid?
Yes, I have, but never the bride.
No.
Come along, baby. Say bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
Wedding boy!
What can I do for you?
And you have no idea
where David Aloysius Harvey lives now?
I´m afraid not.
- You bought this property in 1989, right?
- Yes.
And Mr Harvey obviously moved in
shortly afterwards.
With his wife.
After she died, he let things go.
Then you sold the property in 1989
with Mr Harvey as a sitting tenant.
Did that lead to any bad feeling
between you and Mr Harvey?
Some.
Not much.
The problem we had was that
he was very erratic in paying the rent.
Sometimes he had money, sometimes not.
I presume you had a set of keys to No.15?
Yes.
Did you do anything to the garden
as the owner?
No. Harvey laid the slabs.
I didn´t want him to,
but he did very much as he pleased.
And when were those slabs laid?
I´d say... 1986, ´87?
Because it´s almost certain that body was buried
before the slabs went down.
Yes.
I can see that.
Mr Allen, how can you afford two properties
with your pay?
Esme´s cafe has always done well.
It was her money that paid the second
mortgage.
And your son´s at public school?
That´s right.
When will you ever learn, Pop?
Black people aren´t supposed to own
businesses, houses, get an education...
This is my daughter Sarah.
Now, there´s no need to be rude.
I agree.
Sarah, you´re the law student. And you´re 20.
So that means in the summer of, say,
1986, you would have been...
Um...
14. Mathematics not your strong point?
Not particularly, no.
It´s my son David who´s a wizard at maths.
Did you ever see anyone like this
in the vicinity of Honeyford Road?
Yes, of course. Simone Cameron.
No, it´s not Simone. We´re sure about that.
Please look at the description.
Well, then, if it´s not Simone,
you´ll need to be a bit more specific, won´t you?
That´s if you can be bothered.
And what does that mean?
Well, the police aren´t exactly
noted for their... enthusiasm
when it comes to solving cases
when the victim is black, are they?
Was she black? It doesn´t say so here.
Maybe it´s you who´s jumping to conclusions.
When´s the happy day, Tony?
Two weeks away now.
Well, I´ll see you before then.
Thanks for your help.
- Bye-bye. Thank you.
- Take care.
Got anything on David Harvey yet?
Not yet, guv.
We´ve tried the electoral roll,
NHS, DSS, rates...
I´ve just finished working my way
through the phone book.
You know, Vernon said
he was erratic on paying his rent.
Did you check the credit-reference agencies?
No.
Yes!
Well done, boss.
Mrs Eileen Reynolds.
Got a pen?
Fancy a drink?
I should go home, really.
Right, the twins. Off you go.
- Night.
- Night, Richard.
Got you! Got you.
They´ve done the tests on the skull.
"Nadine" was of mixed race,
West African and probably English.
That explains the Nigerian bracelets, then.
Let´s see what David Harvey´s got to say.
Jesus, I hope the lift´s working.
You know,
you ought to give up smoking cigarettes.
Makes you feel a whole lot better.
Ah, here we are.
There´s nothing worse
than a born-again nonsmoker.
David Harvey?
Yes.
We´re police officers.
Can we have a word with you, please?
So why did you move away, Mr Harvey?
Had my first heart attack.
After I left hospital, I came here
to be closer to Eileen, my sister.
I didn´t want to live there anyway,
not after my wife died.
I only stayed on
because a big darky wanted rid of me so badly.
I should never have moved to this dump.
I´m a bloody prisoner.
Lift´s always on the blink,
the place is full of junkies and pimps.
That´s her. That´s the wife.
She was the gardener.
Lovely garden when she was alive.
I tried to keep it going after...
Oh, well. You know.
In the end, I paved it over.
I can tell you exactly when, as well.
I hired some stonecutting equipment.
Ah.
There you go.
Last week in August.
It was during all that week that I did the digging.
Took up the grass, levelled it all off.
I´d laid about half the slabs by the Saturday,
stayed with Eileen Sunday morning,
stayed on till the Monday.
And Eileen lives locally?
Now, but in those days she lived in Margate.
Anyway, when I got home on the Monday...
I finished laying the rest of the slabs
and cemented them in.
So, the only time
the house was left unattended was...
That must have been on Sunday 31 st August.
That´s right.
- Notice anything unusual when you got back?
- Unusual?
No-one else had been digging in the garden?
No extra earth anywhere?
No.
I must say, if someone asked me what I was
doing on the last weekend in August 1986,
I don´t think I could remember.
How can you recollect so clearly?
Because my wife died on that day
the year before.
Oh, I see.
Eileen asked me down to stay with her
so I wouldn´t be on my own.
Oh, that´ll be my lunch.
I spend that weekend with her every year.
Couldn´t manage without her.
She always sends my food over.
Good. My colleague will want to speak to her.
It´s not her. This is my nephew, Jason.
What´s going on?
We´re police officers.
You´re certain you don´t recognise her?
- What do you want with my uncle?
- Quite sure. I´ll tell you later.
You know he´s not well?
I´m fine, don´t worry about it.
What´s all this about?
Your uncle will tell you after we´ve gone, Jason.
Thank you very much, Mr Harvey.
We´ll show ourselves out.
- Lying bastard. He´d learnt his alibi by heart!
- Yeah, right.
He didn´t shuffle six years ago. If he could lay
those slabs, he could smash a young girI´s skull.
We´d better get a move on, then,
before David Aloysius Harvey dies on us.
Where´s DCI Tennison?
Following up a lead, guv.
OK.
Can I have your attention, please?
This is Detective Sergeant Bob Oswalde.
Bob´s joined us from West End Lane
to assist on Operation Nadine.
Where´s the medical artist studio?
First on the left.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I´m DCI Tennison. I believe
you´re making a clay head for me?
Come in.
It may not look like much at the moment,
but... I have high hopes.
She had the most beautiful skull I´ve ever seen.
Really?
Oh, yes. See this?
The orbicularis oris.
The muscle overlays the maxilla and mandible,
on the eminences
due to the incisor and canine teeth.
Its fibres surround the oral aperture.
Function: Closing of the mouth
and pursing of lips.
I´m a scientist. Otherwise, I´d say it´s the muscle
that allows you to kiss someone.
When will she be ready?
By the end of the week.
- Hang on, hang on, why me?
- Bob needs a desk.
No, that´s not an answer. Why me?
Because you´re only ever at your desk
to drink coffee.
Cos I´m out making sure
the streets are safe to walk!
Superlillie!
What is happening? Bad enough policing them,
let alone working with them.
Just cos he´s taller than you.
No, he ain´t!
Can you shut up and get on with some work?
Tony, can I have a word, please?
Yes, guv?
What´s Bob Oswalde doing here?
Why? Do you know him?
Answer the question, Tony.
He´s part of the team. Kernan brought him in.
Thank you.
Jane.
I want a word with you, guv. Now.
Thank you, Sharon.
What do you mean by co-opting someone onto
my team without telling me?
It seemed to me that a black officer
would be a... How can I put it? A useful addition.
Why didn´t you consult with me?
Actually, I consulted
the Community Liaison Officer,
who thought it was an excellent idea.
A black face prominent in this inquiry,
an antidote to the Burkins of this worid.
- Are you saying you can´t use an extra man?
- No.
- Then what are you saying?
- He wasn´t in the original team.
Now if I ask him to do something,
it can be misinterpreted.
I don´t understand.
It smacks of tokenism, political manoeuvring.
You should have asked me.
Pulling rank undermines me.
- I was just trying to help.
- Oh, bollocks!
Sir.
You can´t work with the man?
Yes, I can work with him.
- My sources say he´s a good officier.
- Yes, I´m sure he is.
What have you got against him?
Nothing. Well, we didn´t hit it off particularly well
on the course.
I don´t want you to marry him!
I don´t want him on my team!
He´s on the team already. I´ve made my decisión
and I´m not going back on it.
Get the man briefed and put him to work!
We´ll review the situation at the end of the week.
I´ll be watching the progress of this case
very carefully from now on.
Do you expect me to believe
this is a coincidence?
No. How many black detectives
did he have to choose from?
It´s nothing to do with me.
I wouldn´t ask to be the token black.
Don´t think what happened on that course
gives you any special privileges.
I don´t.
Don´t you dare tell anyone.
Jane, what do you take me for?
Don´t call me Jane!
Give me some credit.
What happened, happened. It´s gone.
Long since forgotten about.
Let´s not give it another thought.
Yes.
Right. I´ll see you in back in the incident room.
I´ll be along in a minute.
We could have the clay head tomorrow.
End of the week, at the latest.
So, after talking to Harvey, let´s concentrate
on Sunday 31 st August, 1986.
Has Harvey got an alibi?
Yeah, his sister Eileen. I´ll see her shortly.
But what we need now is a name,
to build up "Nadine´s" life story.
Then we can connect her to Harvey.
A couple of statements talk about
a girl staying in the basement at No.15.
- Really?
- Conflicting reports, but it could have been ´86.
Brilliant.
Better start on missing persons.
Bob, handle that, please.
Tony, speak with Harvey´s consultant.
Check he´s not just a bloody good actor.
If he is, he should win an Oscar.
Yeah, right. That´s it for now.
Nice one. I´m glad to see the boss
is keeping our coloured friend in his place.
Guv. Can I put someone else on mispers?
Why?
Ma´am, it´s ridiculous, a man of his experience...
No. He might find something
a more junior man might miss.
Don´t call me "ma´am".
Of course I´m sure!
Every year since his Jeanie died.
He wouldn´t have left until the Monday morning.
He´s a sick man. You shouldn´t hound him.
- Mum, they have got their job to do.
- He´s waiting for an operation, you know.
You´ll be the bloody death of him.
We´re trying to eliminate him from our inquiries.
You wouldn´t hound him like this
if he was a black man!
I´ve questioned your brother once, that´s all,
which is not surprising, considering
a body was found in his garden.
Rubbish! "Simone Cameron" this,
"Simone Cameron" that!
- Was it Simone?
- No.
Exactly. It´s my brother you should
be concerned about. He´s the one that´s dying!
- Is that all for now?
- Yes. Thanks for coming.
Come on, Mum.
Don´t pull me about!
Well, he´s in the hospital tomorrow,
thanks to you!
Mum.
One last thing. You said you and Mr
Harvey fell out because he wouldn´t move.
Yes.
Is there nothing else?
What? No.
But didn´t he sublet the basement
to a girl?
That had nothing to do with me.
What had nothing to do with you?
- Whatever she was doing.
- And what was she doing?
I don´t know, it was none of my business!
It was if she was a prostitute, Vernon.
Why?
As the landlord, you could have been done
for running a brothel.
How dare you use the word "brotheI".
What word would you use?
I was at work all hours. Esme was too.
A neighbour told us men were calling there.
I spoke to Harvey straight away,
but I had no proof.
Then, suddenly the...
...girl...
seemed to have gone.
Did you see her?
Yes.
Was it the girl whose remains we´ve found?
Is that why you won´t co-operate?
Listen.
My family are very upset.
It is an important time for us.
A wedding should be a time of joy.
I have cooperated with you in every way so far.
Then please answer the question.
Did she answer to the description
I´ve given you?
No. She was a white girl.
- Not just light-skinned?
- No. White.
Can you describe her, please?
Small.
Perhaps 5´2".
A tiny thing, really.
Blonde hair - bleached, I´d say.
Young, but not the girl you described.
Did you have sexual relations with her?
I did not.
And what was the relationship
between Harvey and this girl?
God knows.
I wouldn´t put anything past that man.
And when did all this happen, Vernon?
It could have been the summer
you´ve been talking about.
The Viswandhas´ brief´s been bending my ear.
He tells me Forensic are still poking around,
lifting up carpets, floorboards...
So?
Let´s get them out of there as soon as possible.
Of course.
Let´s see it, then.
Very nice.
Right, I want these photos to appear
everywhere in local and national press.
Show them to anyone who might be able to
help. Let´s get the Allens in to see this.
Vernon Allen confirmed there was a tom
working from the basement of No.15.
His description doesn´t fit our "Nadine",
but maybe Nadine was a tom, as well.
Perhaps Harvey was a small-time pimp.
He´s in hospital all day tomorrow,
so I can´t tackle him till the evening.
She doesn´t look like a prostitute.
No.
Well.
Ask around, anyway.
Vernon Allen has confirmed the whereabouts
of his family on 31 st August.
You know there´s that reggae concert in
Honeyford Park on the last Sunday in August?
Some of you made enough overtime out of it!
Vernon Allen says Esme was there and is
every year. She runs a West Indian food stall.
Tony Allen was also at the concert.
It´s an all-day affair: 10am to 10pm.
Vernon stayed at home with Sarah and David.
Tony returned home at about 9pm
so that Vernon could go to work.
I´ve checked with Vernon´s work records
and he definitely did do a late shift that night,
right through Sunday night
and late into Monday.
<i>By the time Esme had packed up
and got home, it was about 10:45.</i>
She says by the time she got home,
all the three kids were asleep in bed.
Obviously, I´d like these accounts verified
wherever possible, OK?
Perhaps that´s the link between
"Nadine" and Honeyford Road.
- Sorry, what is?
- Reggae Sunsplash.
Yeah, go on.
Harvey could have met her there. Or Tony Allen.
Perhaps the victim´s bag of African cloth
was a costume.
She might even have been performing
at the concert.
That´s a good point.
Well, that´s an interesting thought.
Worth following up.
Frank, Gary, go first thing tomorrow morning
to the Sunsplash organisers.
See if they can point you towards any bands
using musicians or backing singers
wearing African gear.
- Right. Any more bright thoughts?
- Nope.
No? All right, well, that´s it, then.
Why are you doing this to me?
What?
Treating me like the office boy.
I don´t know what you´re talking about.
<i>Why didn´t you send me
to see the concert organisers?</i>
You´re busy already. Besides, you didn´t want
special tasks because of your skin colour.
I don´t. I want tasks commensurate
with my abilities and experience.
Well, I want you to continue overseeing mispers.
But I would also like you
to arrange for the Allens to see the clay head.
Watch their reactions.
Thank you.
No.
Are you sure, Vernon?
Absolutely.
Esme?
No, dear. I´d remember if I had.
What a beautiful child!
Tony? What´s wrong?
Come, Tony. Sit down.
Calm down.
Don´t fuss.
It´s all right.
It´s very hot in here. He suffers from asthma.
I see. Have you seen her before, Tony?
No. I´ve never seen her.
You´re certain?
I´m certain.
Our prime suspect´s dying.
I won´t sit back and watch.
I don´t know why you´re so bothered.
It´s just another dead prostitute.
You don´t mean that.
I do, if it means climbing these poxy stairs again!
She´s someone´s daughter.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Anything we get from the old sod
is likely to be thrown out of court anyway.
He didn´t know what he was saying...
No.
I´ve never seen her before.
I did let out the basement room that summer.
I admit it.
Nothing wrong with that.
The big darky complained
about everything I did. He just wanted me out.
So why did you let the room, David?
Did you know the girl already?
No, I´ve never seen her before. Look...
...it seemed a very big house just for me,
and I needed the money.
So I put a card in the newsagent´s.
What was her name?
Tracy? Sharon? I don´t remember.
- How long did she stay?
- Couple of months.
- Which months?
- June, July.
Not August?
No, she´d gone by then.
Did you know she was a prostitute?
No.
Could she have been friends with this girl?
It´s possible.
- Do you think she had a set of flat keys?
- It´s possible, I suppose.
Could she and some friends have used the flat
that Sunday you were at your sister´s?
How should I know?
As you say... I wasn´t there.
Your father remembers her.
Bleached blonde, slim, about 5´2".
Well, I don´t!
Do you like reggae, Tony?
What?
I do. Reggae, soul, jazz. Do you like jazz?
- What are you on about? Just leave me alone.
- Don´t jump the rails.
I don´t remember any girl!
There you go, mate.
One last thing, David.
Could we have a photograph of you, please?
Why?
It´ll help to eliminate you from our inquiries.
- Will I get it back?
- Yes, of course.
One from the mid-´80s, if that´s possible.
Are you the photographer?
No, my nephew Jason.
Mmm. Very good.
Here.
Younger and fitter there, eh?
Thank you. I´ll get it copied and have it sent
back to you as soon as possible.
I´d remove that, David. That´s not very safe.
So somebody can get in if I collapse.
All the same. Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
You´d make a wonderful
Crime Prevention Officer.
Night, guv. I hope you get something.
Thanks. See you tomorrow.
I wouldn´t if I were you, dear.
Hello.
Hi, Rachel. Fancy something to eat?
Well, if he´s a pimp, I´ve never seen him before.
I´ll ask around about the blonde,
- but it´s not much to go on.
- You´re telling me!
Maybe she was one of those that tried it for five
minutes and decided it was no kind of life.
One of the sensible ones.
Still, I suppose someone might remember,
cos most of the giris who do that area are black.
This is a likeness of the dead girl.
Spooky!
No.
Never seen her before either.
OK.
Do your best, OK?
I always do.
See you around. Thanks.
<i>Jane Remember
Friday´s Emma´s first birthday</i>
<i>Don´t forget to send a card</i>
Haven´t forgotten, Mum.
<i>If you´re back by 1030 you can telephone me
Daddy sends his love</i>
Thanks, Daddy.
<i>Mike Kernan at 935
I was hoping for an update</i>
<i>Any results from your clay head?</i>
<i>It´s my interview tomorrow and they´re boud
to ask me about Operation Nadine</i>
<i>Particularly whether my DCI´s
come in on budget</i>
<i>Ring me tonight if you can
or drop by my office first thing Bye</i>
The organisers have given us the names
of the bands using backing singers.
Let´s tread carefully there, Jane.
We´re under the microscope.
How´s Oswalde getting on?
Fine.
What?
There.
How do I look?
Like a Chief Superintendent.
Good.
I don´t know nothing about it.
Do you want to look at them, sir,
before you answer?
- I don´t know her!
- Right, mate? DC Rosper, Southampton Row.
Look at the photograph before you answer!
- You can´t make a man look at a photograph.
- Can´t I?
I can nick him for obstructing police inquiries.
He wasn´t even with the band then!
Can I have a word, Frank?
Let me take a look.
Guv?
Your battyman want a word with you, Frank.
Freedom...
What did he call me?
I don´t know.
You do. I´m gonna nick him.
That´ll be a big help!
Perhaps the guv gave you this lead
to see if you can talk to a black guy
without arresting him.
That drummer might know something.
I´m going back.
Go on, but you´re wasting your time.
Guv?
Thought you´d like to know,
Forensics found a fragment of our girI´s tooth
between the floorboards of No.15.
- Yes!
- I think I might have found her.
Joanne Fagunwa. Mixed parentage,
went missing in ´85 from Birmingham.
- Got a photograph?
- With the file, that´s in Birmingham.
- Get it faxed. If it looks promising, then go.
- To Birmingham?
Did we check on when Mrs Harvey died?
- August ´85, wasn´t it?
- Boss, can we go?
Yeah, come on, let´s go.
Nice one, Bob.
- Later.
- Yeah, man, later.
Where´s Dirty Harry?
Eh?
- Your partner.
- Clint Eastwood.
Oh, yeah, sorry about that, man.
- Do you like reggae?
- Yeah - solid, guy.
Seen!
Cheers.
Peruse these at your leisure.
Wicked!
Cheers!
Vids from ´86. Apparently
two bands used girl backing singers.
Do I have what it takes,
or do I have what it takes?
<i>I´m not saying you killed her, David, but what I
am saying is that she was killed in your house.</i>
Are you all right, sir?
Shit. Call an ambulance, Tony.
Don´t move. Don´t move.
- Hello? Can I have an ambulance?
- Quick!
Jonesy, we´re going to the hospital,
so you can contact us there. All right.
We could lose this one, if Harvey croaks.
Right, come on.
Can I show you these photographs?
Yes.
Do you recognise these amulets, Mrs Fagunwa?
Yes. They belonged to my husband´s family.
He gave them to Joanne.
Then I´m sorry to tell you that they were found
with the remains of a young girl.
Can I show you a photograph
of a clay head we´ve had made?
Yes.
Does that look like your daughter?
Oh, yes.
It´s very like her.
It´s very clever.
I´m sorry.
How did she die?
Well, we´re not certain,
but the circumstances are suspicious.
Don´t tell me she suffered.
Please, please, don´t tell me that.
Reggae
How´s it going, Gary?
I´m having a skanking good time, skip!
Are you, indeed?
<i>Are you feeling all right?</i>
Her father died that year, you see.
I still don´t know why she left home.
She had everything.
She even had her own pony.
She had everything.
Did Joanne ever have any accidents as a child?
No. Well, you know, the usual cuts and bruises...
Oh, yes, she did. She broke her wrist.
She fell off her bike.
Anyway, she rejected it all.
She started having bits woven in her hair.
You know, beads.
Her hair isn´t even black, really,
it´s more a dark brown with gold threads.
She was almost blonde when she was little.
And her skin looks almost tanned,
more than anything else.
She was such a pretty little girl.
We´ve got so many photographs.
I keep meaning to sort them out.
I don´t think the local police treated
her disappearance seriously.
Just another young girl leaving home,
going to London. Loads of them do, don´t they?
I saw a documentary. It isn´t just Joanne.
Reggae
Yes! Yes! Yes!
She always thought the best of people.
Perhaps we protected her too much.
I don´t know.
Have you got children?
No, no.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
That would be lovely.
Perhaps if ours hadn´t been a mixed marriage...
Do you think that could have been the problem?
Made her go off like that?
That´s right. And Bob Oswalde called in.
He´s got a positive ID.
Joanne Fagunwa. He´s bringing Mum in now.
Brilliant.
Turn it down, please!
He didn´t look that bad.
He´s a very ill man, you´ve seen yourself.
He has great difficulty breathing, even lying flat.
He needs complete rest.
Dr Lim, we have reason to believe he was
involved in the murder of a 17-year-old girl.
I don´t mind what conditions you make,
but we have to talk to the man.
This I recognise.
It´s my one and only attempt at knitting.
Why her?
Why her?
Thank you for your kindness.
Do you think you´ll find out how it happened?
You know, find the person who did it?
I´m sure we will.
I wonder...
This may seem...
Could I buy the clay head
when your inquiries are over?
It´s just that...
Does that seem strange?
No, no. I´ll find out for you.
There´s nothing else, is there?
There´s nothing to remind me of my baby.
OK. Take care.
Did the Allens have keys to Harvey´s house?
I suppose they must have.
Where did Tony Allen go to school?
Have you seen this, Bob?
Is that the tape of Joanne?
You should have a look. I think I´m in love.
I was his head of year.
I remember him very well.
Bright lad. Did very well in the fifth form.
Good results, going on to A level,
sights set on a college place.
But when he came back in September, he´d
changed. He was surly and introverted. A loner.
- Let me know as soon as he wakes up.
- I will.
I spoke to him, the headmistress spoke to him,
I got Dad up. Nothing seemed to help.
Ah, there we are. September ´86.
I´m usually right.
Educational psychologist´s report. Help yourself.
I see Tony played in a band.
Did he? I didn´t know that.
We did our best,
but there was really no point in him staying.
The only person he related to was his Sarah.
He´d gone by Christmas.
I still see him in the supermarket from time
to time. Waste, really. Bright lad.
Hello?
<i>Jane?</i>
Who´s this?
<i>It´s Bob Oswalde</i>
<i>Jane Look I know this is a bit uexpected</i>
<i>but I want to talk to you</i>
Can´t it wait?
I´m expecting a call from the hospital.
<i>No</i>
All right.
This had better be good.
I´ve seen this.
There.
Your finger, very interesting.
There´s a better shot in a moment.
There.
Is that Tony Allen?
Tony Allen.
Jesus!
He concealed the fact he played
at Sunsplash and evidently knew Joanne.
The Allens had keys to Harvey´s house.
I´ve been to his school.
Wait, wait, wait. Let´s think this through.
Just cos he´s on the same bandstand
as Joanne...
Oh, shit!
This could be it.
I´m expecting Harvey to come round.
What´s this?
Last night´s dinner.
One of those frozen chilli con carne things.
What have you got for tonight?
One of those frozen chilli con carne things.
DCI Tennison.
<i>Where do you think you´re going?</i>
Oh, right. Good. She got a number?
It´s a call box, is it?
Two, three. Got it.
Tell her I´ll call her straight away. Thanks.
It´s not the hospital. It´s a snout of mine
trying to get through to me.
Right.
What are you up to?
Rachel. It´s me. What you got for me, darling?
Bye.
- What the hell do you think you´re doing?
- What´s this?
It´s lettuce. Well, it was, once.
You really need to eat some decent food.
What was the telephone call?
- Anything interesting?
- No, not really.
The girl who was at No.15 jacked it in soon after,
went legit.
No-one knows where she is,
but they´re sure she´s not on the game.
I took a look at Tony Allen´s school records.
Now, everything was fine until 1986.
He came back from summer holiday
a different person.
The psychologist´s report talks of anxiety,
depressión, low self-esteem...
What is it with you?
- What?
- What are you trying to prove?
Do you have any tomato puree?
No.
- How can I work in these conditions?
- It´s as if you´re trying to take a test.
You´re no different.
I watched you on the course.
You know they´re lined up wanting to see you
fall flat on your face.
Thorndike and the rest of the senior shits.
So you want to be the best, come out on top.
Well, I´m the same as you.
Which is why,
when I calmed down and thought about it,
I understood
why you´d treated me like the office boy.
And why you´ve gone off on your own?
Bob, you are a member of a team.
Am I?
Well, from now on you are.
OK. I don´t suppose
you´ve got anything to drink?
- So let´s pick him up!
- No. Not yet.
I know that boy´s involved in the murder.
You have no evidence.
- I saw him with the clay head.
- They were just on the same bandstand.
So he lied.
We´ll tackle him when the right time comes.
- What does that mean?
- It means, not yet!
I can crack Harvey. I´m sure he holds the key.
Except the bastard might croak on us
at any time.
- I thought you´d go for this.
- I don´t want to argue about it!
Obviously, the point is,
I shouldn´t have come here.
Well, no, you shouldn´t.
We said that at the hotel.
That´s not the point. All I´m trying to say...
Look, don´t bother.
- Oh, hello, guv.
- It went very well, since you ask.
Sorry, what?
- My interview.
- Oh, yeah, right. Good.
Any news on Harvey?
He´s regained consciousness.
I´m going to see him.
Gently does it, Jane.
Get him anything he wants -
solicitors, geisha giris, anything -
so his brief can´t suggest
you got his statement unfairly.
<i>Guv, apparently Harvey´s wife died
in October ´85, not August.</i>
- So his sister´s been telling fibs.
- So it would seem.
Let´s see what Harvey´s got to say about that.
- By-election today.
- Why are you not in your blue rosette?
Senior policemen are politicians
first and foremost, Jane.
Remember that, if you´re up for super.
- Are we in?
- Dr Lim is a bit jumpy, but, yeah, I think so.
Good.
I don´t want him upset. Any extra
pressure on his heart could be fatal.
Hello, Tony.
You don´t remember me?
Detective Sergeant Oswalde.
I´m doing a bit of shopping, and while I´m here,
perhaps you could look at this.
Do you recognise her? It´s Joanne.
Why don´t you people just leave me alone?
Because you´re telling us lies.
You knew Joanne.
No!
You were at Sunsplash together.
Better than that, you played in the same band.
Remember her African costume, Tony?
Her bracelets?
I don´t know what you´re talking about.
Oh, yes, you do.
I don´t.
Don´t you think it´d be a good idea
to talk to me, David?
Get it off your chest?
Why?
David, we know that Joanne -
that was her name -
we know that Joanne
was killed inside your home.
A fragment of her tooth was found in the house.
Doesn´t mean I killed her.
Your wife didn´t die in August, did she, David?
<i>Jeanie died in October 1985.</i>
What´s the point in lying, David?
Carrying all that guilt?
You know you´re a very ill man.
If you do tell me, nothing will happen to you.
It´ll never come to trial.
We´ll just be able to clear this whole thing up.
And most important of all,
you´ll feel so much better.
Yo, Tony!
All right?
What is wrong with you?
Why are you doing this to me?
Doing what, man? I´ve been shopping.
Leave me alone!
Just leave me alone!
You know, I´m a Catholic too, David.
It´s been a long time since my last confessión.
But the one thing I do remember
is that feeling of relief, you know?
A great weight being lifted off your shoulders.
I think we all want to believe in something,
don´t we?
We´d like to think we could just repent,
everything would be all right.
If only we could just turn the clock back
and make everything all right.
You´re dying, David.
Why don´t you just get it off your chest?
Just tell me what happened.
No more lies. It´s too late for lies.
Come on, you can talk to me.
Can I?
Of course. You can have your doctor
present, a solicitor, Jason,
your sister, anyone.
You know, I´m only 55 years old.
It´s a joke.
I´m sure the doctors will do all they can.
I´m very frightened.
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Boss, he´s here.
So, how is he?
A little better.
Jason, your uncle wants to talk to me.
Yeah, so I was told.
He´s asked that you should be there.
Right.
I would ask for you to remain quiet
while I´m talking to him.
OK, right.
Let´s go in.
Is Tony in?
- You know I am. You followed me home.
- Can I come in, Tony?
- No, you can´t.
- Just a few questions.
You heard him. He said no!
I don´t have to answer your questions.
Who told you that? Sarah, the law student?
Go back inside, love.
She says you either arrest me,
or stop harassing me!
I´m arresting you
for the murder of Joanne Fagunwa.
Where are you taking him?
Phone my dad! Phone my dad!
Do you wish to consult a solicitor or have
a solicitor present during this interview?
No.
Water.
Calm down!
Easy! A little interview and it´ll all be over.
Good boy.
I´ve got to get out!
Let me out!
Anthony Allen.
Don´t leave me alone in here!
Please!
I´ll get the doctor take a look at him.
I don´t think he´s fit to be detained!
He´s all right.
Just let him stew for a bit.
I´m the Custody Sergeant.
Don´t try to tell me my job, right?
You do not have to say anything
unless you wish to do so,
but what you say may be given in evidence.
- Do you understand, David?
- Yes.
All right, David.
Let me take you back to what you said originally.
You were with your sister in Margate on Sunday
and Monday, and not at Honeyford Road.
Lies. I didn´t stay the night.
I came back Sunday afternoon.
Not Monday like I said.
So did you ask Eileen
to provide you with an alibi?
No. She knows nothing of this.
But she must do, David,
because she confirmed your story.
She said that weekend
was the anniversary of your wife´s death.
It wasn´t.
She said you spent it with her. You didn´t.
I don´t want my sister dragged into this.
I´m afraid she already is, David.
Leave her out of it.
I´ll tell you nothing if you drag her into it.
Take it easy. Oi, oi!
I told you it was going to be about 20 minutes.
Small interview, sort it out. Turn left.
I hated it down there, anyway.
Godforsaken cold bastard of a place!
Thought I may as well come home,
do something useful.
Get some more work done in the garden.
What time did you get back to London?
About five.
I did some more work and went inside.
I was watching the telly in the front room
when I saw her.
Who did you see?
I saw the girl, Joanne.
She was standing at a bus stop,
waiting for a bus that didn´t run on a Sunday.
And what time was that?
About half past eight or nine.
It was getting dark.
I watched her.
She was standing with one leg behind the other,
sort of swinging herself.
I thought I´d better tell her.
I went out to her.
Told her the bus didn´t run.
Said she should phone for a taxi.
Told her she could use my phone.
She came into the house.
This interview is being recorded.
I am Detective Sergeant Robert Oswalde
attached to Southampton Row Police Station.
- The other officer present is...
- Detective Inspector Frank Burkin.
I am interviewing...
State your full name and date of birth.
Anthony Allen. 5th May...
Louder for the tape.
Anthony Allen.
Anthony Allen, 5th May, 1969!
We must be allowed to see our son!
The officer in charge will be out to see you
in a moment.
I don´t believe this is happening.
Well, it is.
- Come and sit down.
- The officer won´t be long.
I tried to touch her...
Touch her tits.
Do you remember what she was wearing?
No.
Was she wearing a bra?
I don´t think so, no.
- Then what happened?
- I hit her.
I admit I knew her.
- She was your girlfriend.
- No, she wasn´t!
I told you.
She was going out with the lead singer.
I asked her out but she said no.
How did she end up at Honeyford Road
with you?
I had some tapes she wanted -
songs for her to learn.
She came in after my dad went to work,
stayed for an hour or so.
- You went to Harvey´s house?
- No!
You knew he was away. You used your father´s
keys and went next door with her.
What happened then, Tony?
I didn´t kill her.
I tied her up.
Hands behind her back.
What with?
I don´t remember.
I gagged her.
I had sex with her.
Afterwards, I left her lying there.
And where was this?
- What do you mean?
- Which room were you in?
The kitchen.
A belt...
I tied her with my belt.
Left her lying there.
Went and watched the telly.
I don´t know why.
It was like a dream.
What kind of a brother are you
to say things like that to me?
I´m not your brother.
I´m a police officer.
Because you want to be white.
You hate your black brothers and sisters!
You´re black!
Why did you give up playing bass
after that concert?
You´re a sell-out. You wouldn´t understand.
Try me.
Bass notes are the pulse.
They come up at you through your feet.
They sound inside your head.
They beat with your heart from beneath.
A heartbeat... from beneath the earth.
You see? You don´t understand.
I couldn´t play any more.
How could I play any more?
Why ask questions when you don´t understand?
She must have choked on the gag.
There was sick all round her nose and mouth.
I didn´t mean to kill her.
I must give Mr Harvey his medication.
I´ll be back soon, David.
I´m concluding this interview. The time is 8:10.
I´m sorry. This must be awful for you.
I´ve known him all my life.
And... I don´t know him at all.
You´ll be all right to go back in?
Yeah.
I´ll get us a coffee.
If I had buried her, I´d have buried her so deep
you´d never have found her.
She´d never have come back.
- Has she come back?
- She´s inside you.
I can see her looking out at me, looking at me
through your eyes, reaching out to me.
I´m her friend.
She wants to get away from you.
You´re a coffin. You suffocate her.
You´re a coffin! Your eyes are little windows.
I can see inside you.
Through your eyes, I see Joanne.
She hates you.
What did you do with Joanne´s body?
I kept it in a cupboard under the stairs
till the following night.
I dug a hole.
I put the earth in bags.
I had a lot of plastic sheeting.
I wrapped her up in the sheeting.
Buried her.
I´m sorry, Jason.
Sorry you have to hear all this.
I just needed you to be here.
Did you bury anything else with her, David?
- Yes.
- What?
A plastic bag.
What did it contain?
I don´t know.
- Have you seen him?
- They won´t let me see my boy, my Tony.
Hello! I want to speak to somebody now!
I want to see the person in charge!
I banged the earth flat.
Laid the rest of the slabs.
Cemented them in.
There was a smell.
The darky next door...
...complained.
I told him...
...it was the drains.
Thank you, David.
Would you like a car home?
No, it´s all right. I´d rather walk.
Thank you.
Bloody brilliant, boss.
You nailed the bastard´s bollocks to the floor.
Think so?
I know so.
Oh, God, hospitals depress me.
Do you fancy a lift home?
Black bastard... I deserve all I get.
Tony, just stop it, man.
I´m a black bastard... I deserve all I get.
Tony, will you stop it?
I deserve all I get!
- Tony, just stop it!
- Enough!
- A word.
- In a minute.
Now, Sergeant Oswalde!
I´m concluding this interview at 11:25pm.
No!
Don´t leave me alone in here!
Don´t leave me alone!
- What´s all that about?
- What?
- What´s going on between you?
- What do you mean?
What do I mean? He´s off his head!
That´s your considered psychological opinion?
You´re one arrogant bastard.
Don´t look at me like that, Frank.
You´ve been wanting to have a go at me
ever since I got here! Go on, then!
- What the helI´s going on?
- Butt out, Mike!
I´m in charge of this area.
Prisoners are my responsibility.
So where´s his brief?
- He said he didn´t want one.
- He´s climbing the walls!
- Has the doctor seen him?
- Not yet, it´s in hand.
The arresting officer
hasn´t even got credible evidence!
- Don´t tell me my job!
- How would you know, anyway?
Nothing that´d stick in court.
He should go to his cell.
Have you left him alone in there?
You´re pissed off cos a token black´s gonna
have this case signed and sealed by morning!
Bollocks, you are! I´m phoning Tennison.
<i>Please leave your
name and number and I´ll get back to you</i>
This is a waste of time.
You´re wasting my time.
Come on, Tony. You´re as guilty as hell.
I´ve known it from the first time I saw you.
Your guilty secret is all over your face.
I am guilty.
Tell me what happened that night.
We´re all guilty.
I´m choking...
No, you´re not.
I´m choking!
All you´ve done is cry like a baby!
You´re pathetic!
I´m sick of listening to you.
You´re a bloodclaat mummy´s boy!
Come on. You´re going back to the cells.
No. I can´t breathe in there!
You tell me how Joanne met her death
or you go back in the bin and you sweat!
No!
Bastards!
Stop! Stop this!
You´re doing yourself no good.
Stop this! Stop this!
Just calm down, all right?
Stop this!
No-o-o-o!
No!
Quick as you can, boys.
Please, please...
No!
Straight down! Number 7.
Straight in, quick as you can!
I can´t breathe!
Out! Quick!
No! Please!
I can´t breathe in here!
I´ll leave the flap down.
- What are you doing? Leave him alone!
- Piggy, piggy!
Keep the noise down.
Tony Allen´s back in his cell.
Where´s the doc got to? I´ll give another call.
Mr and Mrs Allen still in reception?
Won´t budge.
You should have gone home hours ago.
Let the lad sleep.
Tennison can deal with it in the morning.
Oh, come on.
Last night she came to me
? So softly she came
And she laid her hand on me
and this she did say
It will not be long now
till your wedding day.
<i>A good atmosphere
generates a good contest</i>
<i>He´s always given good fights anywhere Reg</i>
<i>Always good value for money
Nice to see him boxing at British title level</i>
Oh, shit!
Jim! Dave! In here, quickly!
Turn that off! I´m trying to get some kip.
Get a knife, someone!
Oh, Jesus Christ Almighty!
- Get me a mask!
- It´s too late.
- Now!
- Mask!
PRISONER:
Hey, you lot out there.
I know what´s going on! I´m not stupid!
OK. Ready?
One, two, three, four, five...
? For a twelvemonth and a day
? And they want to ask me
the reason why I´m wearing it
? lt´s all for my true love that´s far, far away
- Hey, are you listening to me?
- One, two, three, four, five.
It´s no good, Bob.
Bob, he´s dead.
It´s no good, Bob. He´s dead.
Look at me. Look at me!
Look at me!
The boy´s dead.
Leave him. He´s dead.
Hey, come on, you guys,
is there anybody there?
Yeah? Oh, sh...
No, hang on.
Hang on, the machine´s on.
Yeah, who is it?
Frank?
What was he doing in the cells?
Jesus Christ!
I´m on my way.
<i>Hello ma´am? It´s DI Burkin
Look I´m a bit worried</i>
<i>I´m not exactly worried but Oswalde´s arrested
Tony Allen on suspición of murder</i>
<i>And he´s got him in the interview room now</i>
<i>I mean this kid is climbing the walls
I mean he´s really freaking out and I´m worried</i>
<i>Can you call me back?</i>
<i>Your eyes are little windows</i>
<i>I can see inside you</i>
<i>Through your eyes I see Joane</i>
<i>She hates you</i>
...sign of haemorrhaging.
A mark high on the neck, oblique angle.
Cover him up, Frank.
Good. Let´s start getting packed up, then.
Someone give Oscar Bream a ring.
You´ve killed him, you bastards!
You murdering bastards! You filthy bastards!
Oh, brilliant.
- Not good enough!
- I was told he was on his way!
The prisoner is your sole responsibility.
Put in your report. Now!
Well, that´s my promotion down the toilet.
A boy is lying dead,
and you´re worried about your promotion?
Just don´t start, all right?
The custody sergeant said Burkin tried to call
you, worried by what Oswalde was up to.
Burkin´s a detective inspector, not a limp dick.
He should have sorted it. Calder should have.
- Well, they didn´t.
- Do I have to do everything?
- All right.
- I mean, what´s Burkin paid to do?
All right, I hear you.
How did it go with Harvey?
- He confessed to murder.
- Thank Christ for that.
- But I´ve got my doubts about it.
- What?
We´ve got it gift-wrapped,
and you´ve got doubts?
Yes, I do, and I have good reason for it.
Look, guv, what I need now is to know
what went on in that interview room.
All hell will break loose when word gets out.
Riots.
Oh, don´t be ridiculous.
You remember who you´re talking to!
I´ll listen to those interviews and report back.
You do that.
By the way, you do know that Tony´s mum
and dad are still in reception, don´t you?
Well, they can´t be told,
until we get things sorted.
- What?
- Send them home. Tell ´em tomorrow.
- For their own sakes, it´ll be better.
- We can´t do that.
- Yes, we can.
- How would we explain that in court?
That would reek of a cover-up.
Besides, think how they´d feel.
- I´ve made my decisión.
- Well, it´s a bad one.
That´s what I´m paid for.
Oh, you´re paid to make bad decisions, are you?
You know what I mean.
How much have you had to drink?
Now, you bloody watch it! This wouldn´t have
happened if you´d watched over Oswalde.
You brought him in. I didn´t ask for him.
He´s a loner. He´s a one-man band.
He´s not my type.
That´s not what I´ve heard.
- I beg your pardon?
- Nothing.
No, you explain that comment.
I´m merely suggesting that you might have let
your... personal feelings for him
cloud your judgement. That´s all.
My personal feelings?
Do I have to spell it out for you?
You had an affair on that course.
There. Now, I didn´t want to mention it, but...
- Nothing happened on that course.
- You will bloody argue!
- You´ve been misinformed.
- I hope so. For your sake.
Show Mr and Mrs Allen up to my office,
will you, please?
Not a word about what´s happened.
Understood? Thank you.
- Bob...
- I can´t talk about it now. I´ve got to see Kernan.
Kernan knows about us on the course.
Have you been bragging
about laying the guvnor?
Look, what do you take me for?
Do you think I´d say anything?
All I can think right now is, I´ve got to go
and tell that boy´s parents their son is dead.
That boy´s dead because of me.
Does it matter that Kernan knows about us?
Yes, it matters.
About time, Chief Inspector.
We´ve been waiting out there for an eternity.
Please, can you give my son this?
Esta said he didn´t even have time to get a coat.
I hate to think of him spending the night in a cell.
I don´t want him to catch cold.
Would you sit down, please?
I... I have some bad news to tell you.
I just want my son.
Esme, please sit down.
I´m afraid that after Tony was returned to his cell
after questioning...
he took his own life.
Erm...
Is... Is he hurt?
Vernon, your son is dead.
I´m very sorry.
Do you understand?
I´m so sorry.
How?
He... He used strips of his own clothes...
You killed him. You killed him! You killed him!
You killed my boy!
You killed him! You killed him! You killed him!
You killed him!
My boy!
You killed him!
You all killed him!
You ki...
Tony...
How?
He hanged himself.
When?
I mean, when exactly?
Between midnight and half-past 12.
While we were waiting in reception?
Yes.
Lady...
...may you rot in hell for this.
Come on.
Thank you.
- Where are they going?
- I don´t think they know.
Organise a car for them.
I think Mrs Allen will need to see a doctor,
as well. They probably both will.
- Are you OK?
- Straightaway, please.
Excuse me.
Go to your right, and I´ll show you out.
OK.
<i>Soon the speculation will end</i>
<i>The latest opinion poll
gives Conservative Ken Bagnall</i>
Yes, sir.
Have the family been informed?
Good. What about MS-15?
Well, get onto them straightaway.
David Thorndike should lead the investigation,
which is good news for us.
Absolutely.
A complete bastard.
But a complete bastard who is
the most likely candidate to take over from you,
if you get the move upstairs.
And that will surely depend
on how you handle this business from now on.
<i>Keneth Trevor Bagnall Conservative 13137</i>
Not enough.
<i>Jonathan Phelps Labour sixteen thousand</i>
Did you hear that?
It´s in David´s best interests to stop Southampton
Row being dragged through the mire.
Keep me informed.
Well, we´d better be going.
Looks like I´ve got an early start in the morning.
<i>- I´m a black bastard I deserve all I get
- Tony stop it</i>
<i>I´m a black bastard I deserve all I get</i>
<i>- Tony just stop it man
- I´m a black bastard I deserve all I get</i>
<i>- Will you stop it?
- I´m a black bastard</i>
- Will you just stop it?
- Enough!
<i>- A word
- In a minute</i>
<i>Now Sergeant Oswalde</i>
I´m not talking about Oswalde´s part in this.
You and Mike Calder had the authority to stop
those interviews, but you let them continue.
Oh, no, better yet...
You let Oswalde interview that lad on his own
while you waited for me to do your job for you!
Yes?
- Ready when you are, guv.
- Right.
The rank of Inspector
is supposed to mean something, Frank.
It carries responsibility. You know,
it´s supposed to denote a certain authority.
You won´t make excuses.
You´ll face the music like a man. That´ll be all.
I mean, I just... I just don´t understand it.
We´re at Harvey´s bedside, getting a confessión.
Meanwhile, Bob´s off chasing Tony.
It doesn´t make sense.
His ass is grass.
It´s a dreadful thing to happen.
You carry something like that with you for life.
They´ll close it now, won´t they?
The spade should be suspended.
I mean, why was he brought in?
- You know why, Frank.
- To talk to his people.
Yeah? Well, now one of them´s dead,
and it´s down to him.
Look, I´m not exaggerating or nothing, right,
but that boy was really weird.
I mean, climbing the walls,
screaming and shouting. He was mental.
Believe me - I tried to tell him.
Course you did, Frank.
She´s here. Come on.
Morning, everyone.
Morning.
Well, I expect you´ve all heard about last night.
Just to clarify:
Tony Allen hanged himself in cell No.7
using strips of his own clothes.
I informed his parents shortly afterwards.
Now, obviously, we can expect
a good deal of adverse publicity from this.
I´m told we can also expect an internal inquiry,
led by DCI Thorndike,
to begin almost immediately.
Needless to say, I regret what has happened,
but Operation Nadine continues.
But surely, ma´am, if Harvey´s confessed,
I mean, that´s it, innit?
I´m not convinced
about David Harvey´s versión of events.
Admittedly,
there are a few inconsistencies, guv, but...
Inconsistencies?
He said she wasn´t wearing a bra. She was.
He said he used a gag on her.
We found no traces of it.
Well, he could have removed it.
It could have rotted away.
Well, yeah, it could have.
But he said he killed her in the kitchen.
And the fragment of tooth was in the front room.
Perhaps there was violence in the front room
before the murder.
Perhaps he moved the body after. I mean...
Well, perhaps, perhaps.
"Perhaps" won´t stand up in court.
To be quite honest, I don´t think the confessión
of a dying man will stand up in court, either.
But he knew
that her hands had been tied with a belt.
Yeah, and he said "my belt". I mean, did that
belt look like anything David Harvey might wear?
She was wrapped in polythene.
A plastic bag was buried with her.
And he said the body remained above ground,
which ties up with the maggots.
I mean, none of this was mentioned in the press.
Look, I´m as certain as you are that Harvey was
involved, probably in the disposal of the body.
But I´m not sure that he killed her.
We´ve got to go over Harvey´s statements
carefully.
We´ve got to look
at what Tony Allen had to say again.
You won´t get much there, guv.
I know - I was there.
You may have been there,
but you obviously weren´t listening.
- "Sir."
- Sir.
Frank, don´t you think
it´s a bit late to be pulling rank?
Now, look. We´ve messed up badly,
so now we´ve got to work twice as hard.
Why, if David Harvey didn´t murder Joanne,
would he get involved in the burial of her body?
Can we connect Tony Allen to David Harvey?
A connection strong enough to make Harvey
confess to a murder that he didn´t commit?
I want to go back to Eileen Reynolds.
I want evidence. I want corroboration.
I want to solve this case.
DCI Thorndike, DS Posner,
to see Superintendent Kernan. We´re expected.
Southampton Row´s reputation precedes it,
Jane.
If you come in the front, you may go out the back
with blood on your face.
- Is this on record, David?
- No, of course not.
Good, because that´s bullshit.
If it was ever true, it´s not any more.
I´ve never seen excessive force used in this nick.
Oswalde´s certainly not like that.
Well, with the Cameron case...
You´re here to investigate a death.
- I know why I´m here, Jane.
- Well, let´s concentrate on the case in hand.
I intend to. Don´t worry.
Look, I think it´s important for you to know
that I take this job seriously.
- I´m not prepared to do a whitewash.
- No-one´s asking you to.
It´s my belief that when a foot soldier cocks up,
it´s down to the officer in charge.
I accept that.
I don´t know.
Perhaps you allowed your personal feelings
to cloud your judgement.
I beg your pardon?
It´ll keep.
Could you ask the custody sergeant...
Mike Calder.
...to step into my office, please?
One more thing, David. If I´m to be interviewed,
I´d like to speak to an officer
senior in rank to me.
Well... that may not be possible.
How could you have arrested him for murder?
If it wasn´t for you, this wouldn´t have happened!
Tony wouldn´t hurt anyone -
let alone tie them up, rape them.
- Wait...
- What´s his daughter gonna do?
How did you know she was tied up?
- Another life ruined!
- Who told you that?
- He was getting married!
- Who said she was tied up?
Who told you she was tied up?
Would you like to come this way, please, sir?
It´s just in here. All right?
<i>Tony Allen who was to have been married
this weekend leaves a fiancée and</i>
You can´t pull Sarah Allen in now.
Not with all this going on.
I just want to talk to her. Off premises is fine.
Too soon.
Go back to Harvey.
I have done. He can´t talk at the moment.
I don´t know if he ever will be able to again.
Then see where other lines of inquiry lead you.
We´ll review the situation in a few days.
Go home. Get some sleep.
And leave Sarah Allen out of it.
For the moment.
- Vernon, I have to speak to Sarah.
- How dare you come here? How dare you?
It´s very important. I have to speak to Sarah.
Haven´t you done enough damage?
Just leave us alone.
- I have to speak to Sarah.
- My wife is...
My wife...
Go inside, Pop. Let me handle this. Go on.
- Sarah, were you there that night?
- I don´t know what you mean.
- Or has Jason Reynolds spoken to you?
- I don´t know any Jason Reynolds.
Sarah, please, for Tony´s sake, come on.
I´m closing the door.
Bob.
Give yourself a break.
You can talk.
Ring this number.
It´s a friend of mine.
She helped someone
who was at Broadwater Farm. She´s good.
A shrink?
Yeah. Sort of.
Listen. There´s no shame in that.
Other people make a mistake at work,
the firm loses a few grand.
We make a mistake,
and someone loses their life.
Did Mrs Fagunwa recognise that belt?
No.
Go home, Bob.
- Hello, Eileen.
- I´ve been expecting you.
I wasn´t lying.
He was there with me that weekend.
Came down a lot in those days.
He had a caravan there.
Sometimes he stayed with me,
sometimes at the van.
Well, then, why did you say
it was the anniversary of his wife´s death?
It makes no difference.
I´ve spoken to a solicitor, and he tells me that
confessión is not worth the paper it´s written on.
It was obtained under duress.
And if my brother did it,
why has that blackie killed himself?
- Do you know Tony Allen?
- No, I´ve seen it on the telly.
Because he did it, that´s why.
But then why did your brother confess?
To get you lot off his back.
You know, you´re not helping your brother
by lying for him, Eileen.
I´m not lying!
You don´t have to stop loving him or supporting
him, but you do have to stop lying for him.
Do you know something?
You´re a pious cow!
I´ve done everything for that bloody man
since he´s been ill.
I work my fingers to the bone for him.
I know. That´s what I´m saying. I know you
support him - like taking out that loan for him.
- You lot think you know everything.
- Five grand´s a lot.
How could you afford to do that, Eileen?
My son helps out. All right?
- What does Jason do for a living?
- Now, you leave that boy out of this!
That´s a simple enough question.
He has a sort of... photography business.
- What does that mean?
- In the summer he works the seafront.
I don´t really know. I don´t pry like you do.
- You mean he´s a seafront photographer?
- Yes.
He used to keep a bloody monkey here
at one time. OK?
DS Oswalde, please.
- So, Tony was involved?
- Yes.
Thank Christ for that.
- Isn´t that Sarah?
- Yes. And look at that. Recognise that?
It´s the belt.
I want him picked up.
And I want a team up here. Turn this place over.
No wonder the old sod had a heart attack.
The wardrobe´s full of it.
Here you are, boss. Look.
Close it up. Take it downstairs.
Quite a little photographer, in´t he?
Hang about. Isn´t that Jason?
Yeah. Get onto Vice.
See who publishes this muck.
Bob, get someone down to Harvey´s bedside.
Make sure I´m informed
as soon as he utters a sound.
I want to find this little shit.
Seems as though Jason
preferred amateur models.
Well, he didn´t have to pay them, did he?
The Polaroids are early photographs.
<i>The later ones are much better quality - 35 mm.</i>
They´re quite professional.
Would he have developed them himself?
I think black and white´s pretty easy, but you
need more-sophisticated equipment for colour.
I suppose
he could have had a studio somewhere.
You know, it´s worth checking with those places
that develop dodgy photos.
I mean, they might have an address,
or a contact number, even.
You were right, ma´am. Jason Reynolds
attended the same school as Tony Allen.
In fact, they were in the same year.
When Eileen moved to Margate,
to be closer to her boyfriend,
Jason stayed on in London,
living mainly at number 15.
Right!
The head of the year says they weren´t friends.
Says Jason was a waster, a Jack-the-lad.
But if they were neighbours, they could have
hung out together. But they sound so different.
Which brings us back to Sarah.
Who Kernan has ruled out of bounds.
Boss, I know this is a bit out of left-field,
but I think I recognise her.
Go on.
I dunno. I´ve been looking at ´em for ages.
Richard?
The thing is, Camilla´s really happy there.
What´s Camilla got to do with it?
I think it´s her teacher.
Tell me if you recognise this person.
No, I´ve never seen her before, Inspector.
What about this girl?
No. She´s beautiful.
<i>No, Miriam. She was beautiful.</i>
Her remains were found buried in the garden
of No.15 Honeyford Road.
Her hands had been tied behind her back
with a belt.
The belt belonged to a Jason Reynolds.
Do you recognise this man?
Do you want to look at the photos again?
No need.
Tell me what you know about the photographer.
Jason Reynolds?
I met him in the summer of... ´86.
At that time I was still at school.
Still living with my parents in Margate.
He was taking photographs on the seafront.
You know - a seaside photographer.
He was charming, funny.
As you know, I let him take photographs of me.
For a while, he made me feel attractive,
the centre of attention.
I stripped and posed. I dressed up and posed.
Whatever he asked for, really.
Well, you see, I wanted to get away from home.
My mother was ill and...
He said his uncle had a flat I could rent,
that he´d look after me.
So, I came with him to London,
to Honeyford Road.
Could you all please wait outside?
Just line up quietly.
I lived in the basement flat there for two months.
- June and July?
- Yes.
Did you work as a prostitute, Miriam?
No, not really.
Jason tried to get me to go
with various friends he brought round, but...
none of us really knew what we were doing.
Did you have sex with his uncle,
with David Harvey?
Sometimes. When I couldn´t pay the rent.
Now, do you recognise either of these two men?
Did you have sex with either of them?
- No.
- Now, where were those photographs taken?
- At the flat.
- And in Margate?
His uncle had a caravan.
Can you tell me where exactly?
I can´t remember the name of the site.
It was some way out of town.
All right. Thank you very much.
That´s it?
Yes. Thank you.
Boss, look at this. It´s a 1992 calendar.
So, he´s still using the caravan.
Try all sites in the Margate area.
Phil, I want Eileen Reynolds arrested. Bring her
in, put her in an interview room and let her stew.
Maybe that´ll bring Jason out
from under his stone.
...all the caravan sites in the Margate area.
Jonesy, give him a hand, will you?
This is the belt, Eileen, that was used
to tie Joanne´s hands behind her back.
Do you recognise it?
I´ve never seen it before.
There´s lots of belts that look like that.
Well, I think it´s quite distinctive.
The dead girl - Joanne Fagunwa.
Joanne and Tony.
Joanne and Sarah Allen.
So, why isn´t Mrs bloody Allen sitting here?
Go and arrest her. Arrest Sarah.
Because it´s my belief
that Jason took those photographs.
You´ve no proof of that.
Well, they were found in your brother´s flat,
Eileen.
I don´t know anything about that.
That´s your son, Eileen.
Your son, the pornographer.
Would you look at them, please?
You won´t look at them?
All right, I´ll describe them to you.
The first shows a girl.
She´s about... about 14, I would say.
Your son´s penis is inserted in the girI´s anus.
Her face shows pain and fear.
Stop it, you sick-bastard bitch!
It´s not me in these photographs.
I didn´t take them. Your son Jason did that.
Right. This one shows a different girl.
She´s a little bit older...
No!
Tell me where Jason is.
I don´t know.
We should never have come south.
God, I did my best!
He´s no son of mine. He doesn´t even talk
like a son of mine. He´s some sort of...
- Tell me where Jason is.
- I don´t know.
Where´s your brother´s caravan?
As far as I know, he´s sold it.
To help pay off the loan.

- How is she?
- Sleeping.
I don´t like her taking drugs.
Well, it´s better than having her sobbing all night.
- Pop...
- Hm?
Why are you doing that?
They´re about Anthony.
I know that.
I just don´t see how it helps.
Well, if it helps me,
then surely there´s nothing wrong.
You know I´ll be going back to college
straight after the inquest?
Of course.
Is there someone who can take notes for you,
so you don´t fall behind?
Yes. Yes, don´t worry.
Sarah...
Did Tony ever talk to you about...
about that night?
No.
My bath will be running over.
<i>22-year- old Anthony Allen</i>
<i>is at the centre of an internal police inquiry
into the runing of that station</i>
<i>Detective Superintendent Mike Kernan
today issued the following statement</i>
<i>after the news was< anouced
that the coroner´s inquest into the death</i>
<i>would start tomorrow</i>
<i>I´m very pleased
that the inquest opening tomorrow</i>
<i>comes so promptly after this tragic event</i>
<i>I am confident that the verdicts
will fully vindicate the police</i>
- The Allen family are...
- Any more details about the suicide?
...and therefore have been very fortunate
in being able to secure the services
of a professional barrister.
No-one is on trial.
We are not investigating a crime, but a death.
It´s our job, yours and mine, to decide how
Anthony Allen came to die in police custody.
One word of warning. You may be asked
to study some distressing photographs,
taken both at the time of the young man´s death
and at the autopsy.
I consider the viewing of these pictures
to be vital as an aid to reaching your decisión.
It must have taken a great deal of
determination to strangle himself in such a way.
Well, I don´t know about that, sir.
Well, Professor Bream thought so.
He thought that Tony Allen
may have taken "rather a long time to die".
You did make your checks every 15 minutes,
didn´t you?
- 30 minutes, sir.
- Oh, yes.
Because it´s checks every 15 minutes
for prisoners at risk,
and of course, you had decided
Tony Allen wasn´t at risk, hadn´t you?
Mrs Duhra...
Why was the flap left open?
Because the prisoner requested
that it be left open, sir.
Why?
To let in some fresh air.
Because he couldn´t breathe?
Because he was claustrophobic?
I don´t know, sir.
No, I don´t suppose you do.
If, as you say, he refused the offer of a solicitor...
- He did, sir.
...why did you not make sure
that some responsible adult was with him?
His father, for example,
who was in reception almost the whole time.
Because there was no need.
But his mental health was of concern to you,
was it not?
- No, sir, it wasn´t.
- Shame!
But we can see from the custody
record that you called a doctor at 9:15pm.
Yes.
So, you must have been concerned.
But he didn´t arrive, did he?
Till after 1 am.
Didn´t you think to call another doctor?
I was busy.
A boy loses his life because you were busy?
Please, Mrs Duhra.
Doctor or no doctor, you had it in your power
to send Tony Allen to hospital.
With hindsight, Sergeant, would you not agree
that you made a series of ill-judged,
not to say fatal, decisions?
Yes, I... I made mistakes. I... I admit it.
For God´s sake, man, don´t cry about it.
It´s Muddyman. I´m at the hospital.
Listen. David Harvey died at 7:30 this evening.
God!
This investigation is turning into a graveyard.
How did it go today?
Oh, well. Tomorrow´s another day, eh?
Bye.
Would you say the interviews were carried out
in accordance with PACE regulations?
Yes, ma´am.
You made no attempt
to bully or pressurise Tony Allen?
Sergeant Oswalde...
do you hold a Higher National Diploma
for psychology?
- Yes, ma´am.
- Passed with distinction?
- Yes, ma´am.
- Look who´s here.
It is my intention to call an expert witness in
a moment - a professor of forensic psychology.
But before I do so, I would like to read you
some of Tony Allen´s last recorded words...
...before you had him returned to his cell...
and ask you for your assessment.
Tony: "I´m choking. "
You: "No, you´re not. "
Tony: "I´m choking. I can´t breathe. "
You: "There´s nothing wrong with you. "
Tony: "I´m dirt. I´m dirt in everyone´s mouth,
choking them, my life is dirt. "
You: "This is pointless.
I´m putting you back in the cells. "
Tony: "My life´s a cell. I´m trapped.
So much earth, and mud. "
Earth to earth... dust to dust. "
In the cold light of day, Sergeant,
how would you assess Tony´s mental state?
From that I´d say he was hysterical.
Obsessed with death?
- Yes.
- In despair?
Yes.
Suffering from claustrophobia?
- Possibly.
- Yet you had him returned to his cell.
His ten-foot by six-foot cell.
You had an exemplary record, Sergeant.
Could it be that, in some subtle way,
you were being tougher...
...harder, on this black suspect...
because you too are black?
I´m afraid your question is too subtle for me.
Turning, then, to the attack
Tony is alleged to have made on you...
Do you intend to question Sergeant Oswalde
for much longer, Mrs Duhra?
That rather depends on his replies, sir.
Then I should like to adjourn for the day.
The court will resume at ten tomorrow morning.
All rise.
What was the Commander doing there?
The verdict has to be suicide.
Anything else is unthinkable.
While, meanwhile, Duhra´s projecting my station
as a hotbed of racism and brutality.
Well, I can kiss my promotion goodbye,
thanks to two black bastards.
- I beg your pardon?
- Well, you know what I mean.
No, I don´t.
Oh, for God´s sake...
I´m sorry just to show up like this,
but I needed to talk to someone.
Someone?
You.
I just don´t know what happened -
you know, that night.
When she read that stuff back to me today,
it was obvious that Tony Allen was at risk.
And I´d bullied him.
Why?
Perhaps they´re right. Perhaps I am a coconut.
Yeah, I heard them shouting that.
What does that mean?
A coconut.
A Bounty bar.
Brown on the outside, white on the inside.
I should have thought
it was a bit more complex than that.
Do you think I´m responsible for his death?
No, I don´t.
<i>But it´s what you think that matters.</i>
I think I as good as killed him.
I´ve got to go.
You can stay if you want.
No, I´d better go.
Listen. Call me if you want to talk. All right?
Thanks.
Take care.
And at 11:20pm you interrupted
Sergeant Oswalde, and asked to have a word.
You were concerned with the way
that Sergeant Oswalde
was conducting the interview?
No, ma´am.
You weren´t concerned
for Tony Allen´s safety or wellbeing?
No.
Then why the need for "a word"?
I thought the particular line of questioning
was proving fruitless.
I wanted to suggest another approach
to Sergeant Oswalde.
I see.
So, nothing in Tony Allen´s behaviour
gave you cause for concern?
No. Nothing at all, ma´am.
What happened to Tony Allen came
as a complete surprise to me. And a shock.
Mr Peters, you were in the cell
next door to Tony Allen on the night he died?
Yes, miss.
Did you see or hear anything
that is relevant to this inquest?
I saw the body.
They didn´t want me to. They were trying
to move me, but I saw it lying on the cell floor.
I see. Anything else?
Yes, miss.
I heard the prisoner sobbing,
trying to tell the police that he couldn´t breathe.
I heard some policemen kicking on his cell door,
telling him to shut up.
- And then I heard him threaten them.
- Threaten them?
What exactly did he threaten them with?
Killing himself.
If they didn´t let him out of his cell.
He threatened to kill himself?
Go on.
Well, I heard a police officer -
I´m not sure which one - shouting at him.
And what did the police officer shout?
"Go on, then, Nig-nog - hang yourself. "
Quiet.
They were all shouting, "Do it! Do it, do it! "
Sidney Peters,
can you tell the members of the jury
<i>how you came to be occupying the cell
next to Anthony Allen on the night he died?</i>
I´d been arrested, sir.
For being drunk, sir.
Mr Peters, is it true
that you´re a member of Narcotics Anonymous?
Yes, sir.
Perhaps you´d like to tell the members of the jury
why that is.
Because, ladies and gentlemen, I used to be
addicted to various narcotic substances.
Thank you, Mr Peters.
Hello.
Who is this?
And why should I want to read that rag?
I think you´ll find something in it to amuse you.
Now, promise me you´ll buy it.
Who is this?
Well, it´s a threat, isn´t it?
From Jason. He´s the photographer.
Of course I´m going to court.
I wouldn´t give them the satisfaction.
But someone needs to warn Oswalde. Right.
Morning.
- What?
- Page 5.
Cup of tea, please, mate.
Egg and bacon, sausage...
Beans, toast and a fried slice.
That explains it, don´t it?
Why the boss was so keen to take your side
when Tony topped himself.
So, tell me. What´s she like? She do tricks?
I bet she loves it on top, doesn´t she?
Go on, tell me.
Shit!
All rise.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
the time has come
for you to withdraw and consider your verdict.
But before you do,
I should like to offer you some advice.
There are a number of possible verdicts...
but I think, under the circumstances,
you should focus your attentions on just three.
Unlawful killing.
Misadventure.
Suicide.
I´m sorry about that tabloid shit.
So am I.
I received these this morning.
From the same source, I´d say.
No... look at them in private.
- Have you agreed a verdict?
- We have.
The verdict is suicide.
He wouldn´t kill himself. Never!
He had no reason.
He was getting married this weekend!
He loved his daughter, his family.
He was always a happy boy.
He would never kill himself!
He had no reason!
- Richard...
- Yes, boss?
Start again with the caravan sites.
Start with Clacton,
and any others within the postal district.
And then work out along the Essex coast
from there. Fast, please.
Right.
- Have you seen this?
- Clacton. Everyone else, start working...
"Lovely Donna from Clacton. 36-22-34."
It´s you, innit?
- What?
- In the paper. You´re Donna.
Dirty sod!
Sarah, phone.
- Who is it?
- I don´t know.
- All right. Thank you, Doctor.
- Hello?
Oh. It´s not a good time to call.
Hang on a sec.
OK.
We can´t let him get away with this, Sarah.
He can´t turn us into his victims as well.
All right. But off the record.
I´m not giving evidence. Tomorrow.
No. No, tonight, please.
All right. I can probably make it around seven.
Bye.
Thank you very much.
Double-sweet!
Shangri-frigging-la! Walton-on-the-Naze.
- Where the helI´s that?
- Christ knows.
- Richard, Walton-on-the-Naze.
- Got any street maps?
There. And how long will it take to get there?
This time of day, about three and a half hours.
Right. I want Oswalde to go.
Inform the local plod.
Tell them to sit tight till he gets there.
Why Oswalde?
Because I say so.
Lay All Your Love On Me
- Oi!
- There you go, Sandy. Try them on.
Go on, then.
Come through. One of you stay at the site
manager´s office and keep an eye out.
The other two join me at the van. OK.
I haven´t got a key.
Can we have some of them poppadoms?
This is a Chinese restaurant, Sandy.
I know.
I´ll order for us, eh?
No need to worry your pretty little head.
Cheers.
Bloody hell.
Can you wait outside, please?
We´ll just have to sit tight until he arrives.
I think, when it was really bad... he heard voices.
I know he dreamed of Joanne... night after night.
Always the same dream.
That she´d been buried alive.
He could hear these muffled screams.
He couldn´t bear to be alone.
Confined spaces petrified him.
If only I´d have been around,
I could have explained, but...
Mum and Pop just wouldn´t believe
that there was anything wrong with him.
Sarah...
...you could still help,
by giving us a statement about what happened.
He never had a girlfriend.
No-one was more surprised than me
when Esta came onto the scene.
I don´t suppose it would have lasted,
if she hadn´t become pregnant.
Sarah, please...
Sorry.
I thought only circus people lived in caravans.
- Oh, I am with the circus.
- Yeah, you´re a clown!
No, I´m a knife-thrower.
In fact, I´m looking for a new assistant.
What happened to your last one?
Did you miss one night?
No. I never miss.
She just got too old. That´s all.
All her arse was hanging out of her costume.
Urgh!
I like a nice, young arse. Tight little arse.
- Like yours.
- Dirty sod!
Same again, cock.
Was this the room that Tony was interviewed in?
No, love, no.
- People of his type...
- Disgusting.
What did you say?
Eh? My type?
What´s my type, then, eh? Eh?
Yeah, all right, all right. Calm down.
Here.
Come on, darlin´.
I was at home with Pop until Tony got back.
That was just before nine, as arranged.
As soon as Pop had gone,
Tony said he had to go out for a while.
Of course, he wasn´t supposed to,
so we started arguing.
I watched him go back out to a girl
who was waiting for him. Joanne.
Tony must have got Pop´s keys
from somewhere, because they went next door.
Into Harvey´s house?
Yes.
Joanne was looking for a flat to rent,
and Tony told her about Harvey´s basement -
about how his father owned it, and all that.
I followed them and watched.
They went into the bedroom together.
They kissed.
They lay on the bed together.
I watched for a while, it made me feel odd.
But I was 13 and curious, I suppose.
Then I saw Jason come in.
I had...
I had quite a crush on Jason at that time.
Tony was pissed off to see me, but I wouldn´t go.
Tony and Joanne were dancing together.
Jason was watching them,
encouraging them, telling them to kiss.
Just get my key. It´s too big, look.
Can´t get it in.
Jason found a Polaroid camera.
Jason took photographs.
Hang on. There we go.
- I Feel Love
- So, why don´t you make yourself at home?
This is the studio.
I´ve got my darkroom in another van.
Then Jason started making suggestions.
What kind of suggestions?
That we should undress.
Encouraging Tony to touch Joanne.
I could see Jason was getting turned on by it.
We were all turned on in a way, but...
He ran out of film after about ten pictures,
but he wouldn´t stop.
He became more serious, more insistent.
- Ow!
- Hey, whoa, I´m sorry. All right?
Look, I´m... I´m sorry.
Joanne was scared. Tony tried to stop him.
But Jason got angry.
More angry than I´ve ever seen anyone.
He went completely wild.
He punched Joanne in the face.
Her mouth was bleeding.
He broke a bottle. I really believed he´d use it.
He made Tony tie some tights -
they were my tights -
...around Joanne´s mouth.
Jason took off his belt
and tied Joanne´s hands behind her back.
Don´t be afraid, eh? Nothing to worry about.
It´s the punters. They love a bit of bondage.
I won´t tie you too tight. It´s all acting, really.
I don´t like it.
- Course you do.
- Don´t.
He raped her there in front of us.
He held the broken bottle over her face,
and we did nothing.
<i>We stood and watched</i>
<i>Joane was choking on the gag
and we stood and watched</i>
<i>When it was all over
he warned us that we were guilty too</i>
That he had the photographs to prove it.
He let us leave. We didn´t know what to do.
The dreadful thing
was that we just left Joanne there.
We weren´t even sure
whether she was dead or not.
The following night,
I heard noises in next-door´s garden.
When I looked out my window,
I saw Jason and Harvey digging.
They were putting the earth into sacks and
Jason was taking them somewhere to dump.
I guessed why...
...but I couldn´t look after that.
My nightmare was the sound of those shovels.
The following morning I told Tony...
...and we took an oath together
never to tell a soul.
The next time I made myself look
from my bedroom window,
all the slabs were in place.
Not a sign that anything had happened.
Sometimes... I could almost believe that it hadn´t.
Until she was dug up again.
It was an awful secret
that we carried around with us.
Oh, God... What am I gonna do without him?
Without Tony.
Hey, it´s all right. It´s all right.
I´m a policeman.
Get away from here!
Jason!
Jason!
Jason!
Black bastard!
Come on, nigger.
Come on, run, you black nigger!
Black bastard! Nigger bastard. Come on!
Come on, then, you black bastard!
Black bastard!
You black bastard!
Black nigger!
Jason Reynolds, I´m arresting you
on suspición of the murder of Joanne Fagunwa.
You do not have to say anything, but anything
you do say may be given in evidence.
Nigger! Come on, nigger!
Kill me! Come on. Nigger!
Nigger!
Thanks for the show the other night.
Just your scene, eh?
Nice bit of beef.
Eh? Nice black tubesteak up your stank!
Look, this is not official, you understand,
but under the circumstances
I think it appropriate to give you a little taster.
My recommendation
is that disciplinary papers are served
on Calder, DI Burkin and DS Oswalde.
I am critical of the way the station was run.
Procedures need to be tightened up.
Too many canteen cowboys.
But I find no-one to blame
for the death of Tony Allen.
Clearly, David,
you´re the right man to sort this station out.
And of course, congratulations to you too, Mike.
Nailing Jason Reynolds,
and getting the move upstairs.
I shall have to give you the name of my tailor.
He´s particularly adroit at disguising
any tendency towards the middle-age spread.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Do you intend to do anything
about this press story, sir?
Oh, let it blow over.
Oswalde´s back at West End Lane?
Yes, sir. And besides,
Tennison´s a bloody good detective.
Perhaps. But one who´s displayed
a considerable lack of judgement.
I think you know what I mean.
Well, I don´t think there´s any doubt that
Jason Reynolds is going away for a long time.
The CPS has informed me that they´re not
going to press charges against anyone else.
So, well done.
Right, now, I´m off to the pub,
where I´d like to buy each and every one of you
an extremely large drink.
That won´t be necessary, Jane.
Perhaps I can take this opportunity
to make an announcement.
Mr Kernan here will from now on
be known to you all
as Chief Superintendent Kernan.
I´m also very pleased to be able to introduce
his successor here at Southampton Row:
Superintendent Thorndike.
Thank you, Commander.
I realise that I may have made a few enemies,
carrying out the investigation
on behalf of MS-15.
So, the best thing is to clear the air straightaway.
If anyone thinks
it´s gonna be a problem for them,
get in the way
of the smooth running of the station,
then they should apply for a transfer
immediately.
And since we´re all about to go off duty,
just to prove I have a lighter side,
I´ve arranged for us all to have a drink
to mark the occasión.
Round the back.
- So, I didn´t even merit an interview?
- Jane...
Sir, could I have a word with you, please?
Official or unofficial?
- Official.
- Jane, it can wait, surely?
No, it can´t wait.
OK.
You´ll have my formal request
for a transfer first thing in the morning.
Very well.
