I take it that that's a cut, or what?
I am the greatest.

Oh, honey!
Whoa!
Watch out for the tree though.

- [Mom] Do a trick.
- How proud are you of him?
- Oh, my God. He's amazing.
Tell me the truth.
Did Mommy do that painting for you?
Hey. Wow, look at that.
I just got one question.
What the heck is it?
- It is abstract.
- Sorry.
- When I get signed, I'll buy you a new house, okay?
- What's wrong with this house?
Ready?
- [Glass Shatters]
- [Dad] Oh, shit.
Okay, make a wish. Make a-
- So, how old are you, Mom?
We werejust wondering.
- How old am I?
[Dad] You look gorgeous.
You don't look a day over-
[Luke]
Just spit it out, Dad.
[Dad] Brendan Hume, you'vejust
won M. V.P. Our golden boy.
[Exhales]
Number one!
Number one. Number one.
- [Dad] Let's get this baby lit.
- [Brendan] Can I slap him? Will he wake up?
- No. No, no, no.
- Please. He's gonna kill us.
- [Brendan] Here's a surprise!
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday, Lukey!
- Happy birthday, Lukey!
[Lucas]

It feels no different than yesterday

Do you want your 14 punches now or-
Uh, a little later, after I wake up.
Get off me! Aw, man!

[Woman]
Can you get me those faxes from London?
[People Chattering]
[Man]
All right. Thanks.
Can I bother you?
You know, just when you think
there's no order anywhere...
there's order lookin' right at you.
- Okay.
- What do you need here?
Annie said I need you to approve this.
This guy worked here at Starfiish
for six years...
but, uh, his wife's dead,
no kids, no will.
I just wanna roll his pension back up
into the fund and make it easy.
[Sighs] Come on.
Don't make me fiile with the state.
We fiile with the state so that, one day,
if somebody looks back at this guy's death...
he will see that we did our job.
You're right.
We gotta cover our asses. I got it. Sorry.
No, no, no. No, we do our job...
and we do right by a guy
who worked for us, lest he die in vain.
What's that "order in the universe" thing?
Well, you- Our insurer spent
300,000 bucks on this new model-
new fiield data, new society.
Who is the ideal employee?
Who dies how and when?
They sent it over to show
what a great job they're doin'.
And you know what it says?
It says that people with kids
live longer than people with no kids.
People with two live longer
than people with one.
Smoking is bad. Speeding is bad.
Deaths in the family are bad.
Divorce is bad.
It's just kinda nice to see
that all that junk is still true.
Brendan, you're such a kiss ass.
- [TVPlaying, Indistinct]
- Hey.
God gave me the skills.
I can't help it.
- Mom, I need to go kill myself.
- Of course you do, Lukey.
- May I be excused?
- No.
I've got a cretin for a brother.
I've got a no-dick for a brother.
Okay! You stop right now.
- You should know better.
- What?
Let's be a family, shall we?
- Can I say no?
- No.
I demand emancipation.
I want a lawyer.
- Okay, I'm fiiling right- now.
- [Dad] I'm home.
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss dinner?
No, there's plenty.
I'll heat something up for you.
Dad, I need a ride to the city
on Saturday.
Mmm! The city?
Yeah. It's an exchange game.
And, uh, fiirst line again.
- No kidding? That's fantastic.
- Yeah.
- Waldron must love you.
- Yeah, 'cause he's a kiss ass.
Well, good for him. We all goin'?
- No. Lukey's got soccer.
- Yeah, but I'm not starting, so you can just-
Maybe you should just kiss some more ass...
or just not suck so bad.
- I heard that could actually-
- Hey, hey, hey. Huh?
Dad, I was just kidding.
He was just being an idiot.
Don't call him an idiot.
Lucas, you have a loyal and loving brother.
- I agree.
- A loyal, loving kiss ass.
Look, can we just all please-
be civilized for once,
before I kill somebody?
- Whatever, weasel.
- Duh. "Whatever, weasel."
Luke, Luke, Luke. Plate.
- Come here, you little punk.
- Ow! Get off me!
See what you miss
when you don't come home?
Well, at least they're not throwing food.
- [Crowd Cheering]
- ## [Man Singing, Indistinct]
[Dad] You played a heck of a game, kid.
I'm proud of you.
- Heck of a game.
- Thank you.
Love the way you're handling the puck.
Shit.
So, uh, some of the guys have been talkin'
about maybe going to college in Canada.
Canada? Canada is far.
- You still have Lukey.
- Ah, there's a comfort.
Oh, no. Come on. I'm kidding. You get to
kid about your kids, or you lose your mind.
Look, you had a great game.
You've had several great games, but-
Professional hockey? Is that what
we're talking about here, Bren?
- I mean, maybe. I don't know.
- That's a risky business.
And this is coming from your extensive
professional sports background?
No. My extensive risk-assessment
background, thank you very much.
Risks, liabilities- the stuff of life, Son.
No, that's the stuff of your life, Dad.
- Your thrilling life.
- Hey, don't make fun of your father, you bum.
I'm the only one you get.
[Engine Revving]
I guess we can talk to Coach Waldron...
- and we can research schools in Canada-
- Okay.
And fiind somebody who can educate us
on hockey versus law school.
- Dad, Dad.
- What?
Educate us?
Look, I just wanna play some hockey.
Hey. Lights.
Dad. So, what do you say?
- L- I said we could look into it, all right?
- Okay.
- Please don't tell your mother.
- I would never.
[Tires Screeching]
Where the heck is the darn expressway?
[Bell Chiming]
Oh, great.
- Hey, where do you think you're goin'?
- I need my fluids, Dad.
Oh, yeah.
The obligatory slushee stop.
- They have 'em in there, right?
- That or something worse for you.
- Do you have money?
- Yeah.
- Well, quick in and out, 'cause we gotta get home.
- All right.
Hey, honey, it's me.
I just wanted to let you know...
that our son is going to Canada
to play hockey.
He didn't want any kind of long, drawn-out
good-bye, so I dropped him off at the airport.
He says he'll call, but-
[Chuckles]
Of course, we may never
see our son again.
But as long as he's happy, right?
Okay.
- I love you, and we'll be home soon.
- [Man] Bullshit, man!

He's a man now.
He can take the subway.
[All Laughing]
Can we get some help?
Could somebody help us, please?
- Please! He's been- He's hurting!
- Doctor!
He was cut. Somebody cut him.
Get an airway open! Create an airway!
- He's my son. That's my son.
- Maggie, get him. Get him.
- Brendan, we're in the hospital now.
- Sir, you need to stay back here.
- We'll get Maggie to take care of you here.
- They'll get you fiixed up now.
Sir, I'm sorry.
You need to stay right here.
- Why can't-
- The doctors need to do their job, sir.
- You need to stay back here.
- I can't go in there?
I'm sorry.
Okay. Well, he'll be okay, right?
That's my-That's my-That's my son.
His name's Brendan.

[Woman]
That's Joe Darley.
He's... a kid.
He's a runt, almost 23.
And he's an animal.
[No Audible Dialogue]
They're supposed to
have some kind of a, uh...
pretrial hearing tomorrow, and...
they want me to go and make a statement.
You wanna go with me?
You go.
Put that... animal in jail.
That's what the cops called him-
animal.
Are you gonna take that off?
The school said they wanted
to do a memorial.
At the next game, the team
wanted to do something.
That's nice of them.

[Man] Today's easy. I need you to
sit there, put the fear of God in this guy.
If the judge asks you, you tell him what
you told us and identify Darley in court.
Okay? The minute I get your statement,
and with you sitting right there...
the public defender's
gonna wet his pants and fold.
I'll make a deal in fiive minutes,
get this guy in jail today. Easy peasy.
Deal? Wait, wait.
Hang on. What do you mean?
What-What deal?
I want this guy to go away
for the rest of his life.
No. I can get you
three to fiive guaranteed.
That's a very decent result.
I'm talking guaranteed time.
Not maybe,
not the jury didn't feel up to it.
That's worth more than chasing some
make-believe 10 to life, and the guy walks free.
- You want that?
- He killed my son.
Mr. Hume,
I've got one eyewitness-you.
That's nice, but do you know
how many cases with one witness...
I don't even bother to try for a deal on?
The machete magically disappeared.
The only blood we could find on that weasel
was his own from when the car clipped him.
And you picked
the only gas station in America...
without a working surveillance camera.
We've just got your word. That's not bad,
if I can scare the guy into a deal.
You're using my son's death
like some kinda card trick.
Look- [Chuckles]
I get a banger off the street.
Ayear or so,
somebody does my job for me.
He doesn't get out of there alive-
fiine with me.
He finds Jesus- fine with me.
But we get religion and go to trial-
as much as I'd love t0-
and the defense starts working on...
when was your last eye exam and what
do you have against inner city youth?
And how unfair it is for them
to grow up so violent...
how they're forced into initiation killings
or face execution themselves.
Do you want a jury feeling sorry
for this fucker? Huh?
- You want him to walk?
- Wait. You said... initiation killing.
L-l- I thought this was a robbery.
It only looked like one.
It was an initiation. You kill someone
at random to get made in a gang.
It's the price of admission.
Are you saying that Brendan was killed...
so that some asshole
could feel more like a man?
So that he could be in some club?
[Sighs]
This is a "take it or leave it" thing,
I'm sorry to say.
[Prosecutor] Your Honor, I'd like
to enter the statement of a witness...
present at the time of the attack-
father of the victim.
We can enter that at trial,
can we not, Mr. Barring?
I believe, Your Honor,
if we enter it today...
defense will change their plea to guilty.
Save the People
the time and expense of a trial.
- [Judge] That's the statement?
- [Paper Rustles]
[Judge]
Mr. Hume.
Mr. Hume.
You're giving evidence that
Mr. Darley here, before your eyes...
attacked your son
and caused his death?
You're saying you'll
testify to that in a trial?
No, Your Honor, I am not.
What?
It was... dark.
There were a lot of them.
I can't be sure anymore.
Mr. Barring, do you expect to obtain
evidence other than Mr. Hume's here?
No, Your Honor, I do not.
I'm dismissing this case. Mr. Darley,
you are released from custody.
You may return with a bailiff
to the holding cells...
to retrieve your personal effects.

You're free from wondering

Where are you, you bastard?
You wanna send me a reward
for fiinding that wallet of yours?
You tell me where the fuck
you are right now!
No, I'll tell you where the fuck you are.
You're in my end
of the fucking sewer, buddy.
I say who lives. I say who dies.
Now, you'd better get that
through your fucking skull...
because there's no more warnings.
I'm comin' for some fucking family time.
No. You listen to me.
You go near my family...
and I will cut out your goddamn guts
like I did your fuckin' friend!
- Do you hear me?
- He wasn't my friend.
He was my brother.
And now I'm coming
for the rest of your family.
You just bought them
a death sentence, motherfucker.
Don't-
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, can I have Detective Wallis, please?
Detective Wallis!
Get me Detective Wallis right now.
- Shit.
- [On Phone] Homicide, this is Wallis.
- They threatened my family.
- Mr. Hume?
Fuckin' trash!
Threatened to kill my family!
All right.
Where is your family right now?
They're at the school!
St. Bartholomew's!
Just help us, please.
[Police Radio Chatter]
Helen! Luke!
[Helen]
Nick?
Oh, my God.
What the hell is happening?
Honey, why are the police out front?
Nick, you're scaring me.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh! Nick, talk to me.
Dad, what's going on?
Nick!
- What's going on?
- [Doorbell Rings]
You stay there.
Thank God you're here.
Your son was a hockey player.
[Nick]
Yes.
Hmm.
The car will stay here tonight.
Now, Mr. Hume,
I think it's time you told me.
Exactly who did what to whom?
You make war on the wrong dog?
Hmm? That what you did?
Thought you could just go
kill some little asshole...
because you live all the way out here?
[Helen]
What are you saying?
- What is she saying, Nick?
- I've done nothing wrong.
Well, then why don't you tell me...
how you made Billy Darley
this pissed off at you?
You asked for my help.
All right. All right.
Just, um-Just try to get
through the night, Mr. Hume.
And be grateful you're still alive.
But if you started a war...
God help you.
What have you done?
Hey.
How do I make it stop?
Did you start it?
Listen. I really don't care
what happens to me.
I just need them to be safe.
Tell me how to stop this.
[Sighs] Well, fiirst off,
do everything they tell you.
Everything.
And don't worry, Mr. Hume.
We put out an A.P.B. On Billy and his gang.
I can't believe I didn't see
what was going on with you.
How could you do what you did?
You thought you could...
balance the equation...
put order in the universe?
I lost our boy.
Your boy.
You are a good father...
and nothing that's happened
changes that.
And I love you.
And I always will.
[Police Radio Chatter]
Well, it's good that you're
getting rid of it anyway.
Yeah.

I'll ask the doctor.
This thing stops right now.
God knows why you're still alive.
But you're being given a second chance.
You think that offiicer's
out there protecting you?
He's protecting you from yourself.
He'll haul your ass right to jail
if I say so.
You want your retribution and you kill a couple
of punks, and it bought you what? Huh?
Everybody thinks they're right in a war.
Everybody still dies in the end.
You are never gonna win this, Mr. Hume.
Nobody is.
I killed them.
I killed my family.
Well, your son's still alive.
- What?
- Barely.
Where is he? Is he here? Where is he?
Wait. Hey, hey, hey.
Come on. Wait a second now.
- Luke. Luke! Lucas!
- [Monitor: ; Sustained Beep]
- Calm down.
- It's all right. Let him go.
- Where's my son?
- Sir, you need to get back to bed.
- Tell me where my son is!
- He's in Room 206.
Lukey? Luke.
- We're taking care of your son.
- [Wallis] Doctor?
- Luke?
- Doctor, it's okay. Just let him through.
- Is he going to wake up?
- I can't say right now.
It was never gonna balance.
What did you say?
The equation.
Sometimes it's... just chaos.
That's all there is.
I'd like a minute with him.
Please.
[Sighs]
I'll be waiting.
Hey, Lukey. Can you hear me?
Can you move your fiingers?
Son, just move your fiingers
if you can hear me.
Luke, I know that, um-
that you think that...
I didn't care about you
as much as your brother.
And God-
I don't know.
Maybe I didn't at fiirst.
You know, um...
when your mom and I...
fiirst had Brendan...
he was just-
he was so amazing to me, you know.
He was like, uh-
He was like this miracle kid.
And I always knew exactly
what to expect with him.
And then when you came along,
I don't know-
I kind of expected to have
another Brendan, you know.
I expected you to be just like him,
but-but you weren't.
I mean, you were so different-
different than anyone.
Different than me.
You're just so much more-
So much more like- like your mom.
You know, stubborn and...
too much passion.
Your mother-
Oh, she meant the world to me...
and so do you.
I just want you to know that I love you.
L- I love you so much.
I love your brother,
and I love your mother, um-
I love our family, and l- and l-
I'm-
I'm so sorry...
that I wasn't a better father.
I'm... so sorry...
that I couldn't protect you guys.

Hey, you. Get a doctor.

Hey, Owen.
L-I need you to check a number for me.

[Speaks Spanish]
His boy Heco is crashing at 113,

He's usually hooking up around

[Muttering In Spanish]
One more thing.
I need to buy some guns.
Help you?
I need guns.
I don't know you.
I came from the Four Roses.
I'm gonna guess.
You're a little bit far from home.
Well, don't let me smell fear on you.
Fear... is for the enemy.
Fear... and bullets.
Lots of fuckin' bullets.
You've got the bastard ofbastards.
A.357,
for guaranteed head removal.
That's-That's a sweetie.
You got your standard-size.45...
supersize.
That's a fuckin' hungry man right there.
And you got the king of mayhem.
Half cannon, sword ofjustice.
Take this fucker to the Holy Land,
start your own crusade.
Any one of these is bound
to make you feel better...
about what's bothering you.
What about that one?
This one?
All right.
I'll take this... and these.
That's three-fuckin'-grand
worth of killin'.
You got three grand worth
of killin' to do?
There's fiive.
Well, that makes you
a preferred customer.
I'm gonna give you some accessories...
just because you got a thing about you.
You have got a killing thing about you.
You surely do.
[Zipper Zipping]
[Gun Cocks]
You the motherfucker after my son Billy?
He's your son?
That'd make you the motherfucker
killed Joe. That right?
You killed my youngest?
Now you're after Billy, yeah?
Yeah. I'm after him.
Well, Billy's no damn doin' of mine.
Anything he did's no damn doin' of mine.
[Sets Gun Down]
So, somebody needs to make
somebody pay for something...
to make themselves feel better.
Billy'd be the one to pay.
[Scoffs]
Kill the little piss-pants.
See if it makes a damn day's
difference to me.
Dad to dad, don't tell me about it.
Just... go do it.
Lord knows I've been patient...
and you're a cash-fuckin'-customer.
But you think about
asking me where Billy is...
I'll kill ya.
Go your way now.
Go with God.
Bag full of guns.
