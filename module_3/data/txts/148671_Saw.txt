Go, go, go.
Suspect on foot, entering warehouse.
In pursuit.
Go.
Freeze! Stop right there!
Put down the weapon!
You can't
stop it now.
Nothing can stop it.
On the ground!
On the ground.
Drop it, right now!
Halloran.
Detective Halloran.
If he's not here
in 17 minutes,
five people
are going to die.
Get Halloran here, now!
Where the fuck is Halloran?
People are gonna die, man!
Doesn't he know?
All of you, get back.
Halloran!
Edgar!
Edgar, what the fuck
are you doing?
- You put down that remote.
- I can't.
What's that for?
The games are
just getting started.
- What game?
- His games, his rules.
I gotta choose who dies.
Them or me.
Edgar, I don't want
to shoot you, but I will.
Drop the remote.
I got him, should I take it?
Target the remote.
If he moves to trigger it,
blow it to shit.
Running out of time!
Who else is there?
Tell us what's going on!
Who's controlling you?
I'm not fucking dying.
Which one of you assholes
shot him in the chest?
The game.
It's started...
What is this?
What the hell?
What the fuck?
Yo, what the hell?
Oh, shit.
Oh, god.
What's going on?
No, no, no...
This can't be happening!
Someone, help me!
No, no, no...
Help!
Somebody
please help me.
Please, help me!
Help! Help!
Please, help me!
Just stay the fuck back!
<i>I'm sure you are all wondering</i>
<i>why you're here.</i>
You deny<i> culpability,
no doubt,</i>
<i>for the circumstances
in which you find yourselves.</i>
<i>Salvation can be yours,</i>
<i>if you cleanse yourselves</i>
<i>of the habitual lies
which have brought you here.</i>
<i>Lies that you have
told yourselves,</i>
<i>lies that have
brutalized others.</i>
<i>Confess.
The truth will set you free.</i>
<i>But any attempt</i>
<i>to violate my rules
will kill you.</i>
<i>I want to play a game.</i>
Fuck you!
<i>First,
an offering of blood,</i>
<i>no matter how little,</i>
<i>will give you a green light</i>
<i>to escape from this room
with your lives.</i>
<i>If you can release yourself
from your demons,</i>
<i>you can begin
to shed the chains</i>
<i>that those demons bring
with them.</i>
<i>Make the simple blood
sacrifice that I've requested,</i>
<i>or face severe consequences.</i>
<i>The choice is yours.</i>
The fuck
is going on over here?
No, no, no...
No, no, no!
No!
No! No!
What do we do? What do we do?
Someone do something!
Hey! Wake up!
Wake up!
"An offering of blood..."
"No matter how little..."
"An offering of blood..."
Cut yourself!
You need to cut yourself!
He wants blood
and then you're free!
Cut yourself,
he wants blood!
Cut yourself!
Fuck!
Come on, come on, come on.
Yes! Holy shit...
You need to cut yourself!
What the...
No...
Cut yourself!
You need to cut yourself!
Cut yourself!
Where the fuck are we?
He hit the remote,
but nothing triggered.
As far as we know.
You think
the game's real?
Don't know.
And why do you think
he asked for you?
We're good friends.
I put him away twice.
Edgar Munsen is a
sociopathic meth head.
Been in and out of prison
for assault and battery,
armed robbery,
drug dealing.
Nice guy.
Doc, we need him awake.
We've got questions.
Sorry, Detective.
The bullet's lodged
against the heart.
I've got him in a barbiturate-induced
coma until he stabilizes.
How long?
Swelling has to
come down first.
Two hours. Two weeks.
I can't tell you.
Excuse me.
Start the suspect list
with Munsen's
known associates.
This is not
gonna end well.
Hungry?
Help!
Please, somebody help us!
Help!
Please! Don't...
Stay still.
What do you want with us?
That voice...
It said salvation
can be ours if we,
cleanse our soul
of our lies.
This is some kind of
fucked up confessional?
The truth
will set us free.
Honey, my soul is clean.
It's Anna.
And, bullshit.
I'm Mitch.
What's your name?
Carly.
Don't touch me.
This is some bastard's
sick idea of a joke?
He said it was a game.
Well, then I hope, for all of our sakes,
that it is a game.
Oh, yeah?
Why's that, sweetheart?
Because games can be won.
This is cray.
What the hell?
Did anyone phone
the police?
Underhand!
Whoa!
Overhand!
Okay, you got
some heat on it!
Cell phone's off
for a reason, Halloran.
Well, what do
you think, El?
I don't know,
he looks a little pale.
Let's get this thing off.
Ooh
Ah.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Someone's been studying
up on John Kramer.
A copycat?
Hope not.
Kramer's been dead for 10 years.
What's up, Doc?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Good to see you.
You too, man.
You're, uh...
You're working this neighborhood now?
Uh, yeah, I joined
homicide last month.
Jesus,
what happened to this guy?
You two know each other?
Logan was our medic
in Fallujah.
Hey, uh, I'm sorry
to hear about Christine.
How you been, man?
Uh, good, Keith.
Yeah, I'm doing well.
All right.
Eleanor.
What is it?
Okay, then.
"And then
there were four..."
You got a computer
we could stick that in?
<i>The games have begun again.</i>
<i>And they will not stop</i>
<i>until the sins against
the innocent are atoned for.</i>
<i>I will take care of
the next four,</i>
<i>you take care of the rest.</i>
We gotta get that
to voice rec.
It's not him.
It can't be.
Right?
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
No, that's not creepy at all.
No. No!
No, no, no...
Help!
Somebody please help us!
Where is this sick
fuck taking us?
Did anyone see anything?
No, nothing.
I got fucking drugged!
He said, "Confess."
We have to confess.
Yeah, you got something
you want to confess?
Have at it. Come on!
Damn it, we all have
something to confess.
I sold a kid a bike once.
<i>He had an accident 10 minutes
after I sold it to him.</i>
It's not my fault
he couldn't handle
such a powerful damn bike,
all right?
He died!
That's it?
That's all you did?
You sold a kid a bike he died on?
Come on, man!
That's it!
I said that's it, man!
Yeah, bullshit.
And what about you, sweetheart?
Come on.
We lost our baby.
Anna... Anna.
Tell me that
this isn't happening.
My husband made a mistake.
No, no, no.
That's not a confession, come on. Come on!
Come on!
I don't know what the fuck
you want me to say, okay?
I let
our marriage fall apart.
A confession is, "I killed
a hooker in Tulsa,"
or, "I ate
my fucking neighbor."
Not, "I need
marriage counseling."
Carly?
No.
Nothing I can think of.
Yeah, well, think faster!
You think faster!
Oh, my God.
We're going to hang.
Play the damn tape, Mitch.
Oh, God!
<i>While
I am certain that there is</i>
<i>a desire
to point fingers at me</i>
<i>for the blood that
has been shed,</i>
<i>unless you turn
that finger inward,</i>
<i>I assure you,
more blood will be lost</i>
<i>and all will be judged.</i>
<i>We will begin with one.</i>
<i>One who is not only a liar,</i>
<i>but a thief.</i>
<i>A purse-snatcher.</i>
<i>And when you had a chance</i>
<i>to fix the harm
that you'd done,</i>
<i>you chose to do nothing.</i>
<i>Now it is you who could die
without the right medication.</i>
<i>While unconscious,
this deceiver among you,</i>
<i>this criminal,
was injected with a poison.</i>
<i>One of the syringes
in front of you</i>
<i>holds the antidote.</i>
<i>One is a saline solution,</i>
<i>the other, an acid that will
cause an excruciating death.</i>
<i>Inject the correct one and
your chains will be released.</i>
<i>Failure to make
the right choice</i>
<i>could result
in death for you all.</i>
<i>I ask you,
what is a life worth to you?</i>
One of you 'fess up,
or we all die.
Okay, check yourself
for marks.
If he injected us,
there could be marks.
Bingo.
What are you doing?
It's okay, it's okay.
You just got to pick a needle,
blondie.
Look, we get out of these things
when you pick an antidote.
Or else we all die, Carly!
No, no.
What if it's the acid?
I won't.
Bullshit, you won't.
Maybe just confess, Carly.
Okay, did you
steal purses?
Yeah, years ago,
but I didn't kill anyone!
No, no, no!
No, that's not the repentant attitude
this guy's
looking for, okay?
You're lying.
You're lying!
No! I was broke, okay?
And yes,
somebody died,
but it wasn't my fault.
Okay.
Choose, or I'm gonna
stick them all into you!
- No!
- Yo, man!
Are you
kidding me? Stop!
Just let her look!
Do any of these numbers
mean anything to you?
Choose now!
I'm trying!
$3.55.
What?
What does that mean?
What?
What a life is worth to me.
Oh, fuck...
Choose, right now!
Come on, pick!
Pick one! Pick now!
Please!
- I can't do it.
- Pick one now!
We're all going to die!
Pick now!
Come on. Choose!
Come on, pick one, Carly!
I'm not gonna
fucking do it!
No, I'm not going to!
Fuck you! I won't do it.
Pick one, now!
Come on, pick!
Pick!
Fuck! I'm not gonna pick!
Now! Now, Carly, now!
Pick now!
Pick one!
Pick one!
Fucking asshole!
I'm not the one
who put us here.
Get a hold of yourself.
I just saved our lives.
Yeah, but you took hers!
You killed her.
You selfish
son of a bitch.
No, stop!
Both of y'all
need to chill!
What the hell?
A life is worth $3.55.
What?
That's what she said.
Yeah.
Yeah.
$3.55.
There's more numbers
on the inside of this.
It could be
the combination.
Dental IDs Buckethead
as Malcolm Neale.
Malcolm Neale?
I remember that case.
His wife was murdered
five years ago.
A home invasion.
Perp slit her throat.
They made him watch.
I remember.
Malcolm Neale was a, uh, degenerate gambler.
Wife's murder was on him.
He owed some bad guys some money.
And did you ever get around
to convicting those bad guys?
Scratch marks
from fingernails.
There was a struggle,
presumably with the killer.
The partial decapitation
was made
by a circular saw.
There are traces
of ferric oxide,
hematite, in the wound.
Rust, from blades.
What about
the voice recording?
Anything off
the flash drive?
The voice was
John Kramer. Matched.
Identical.
Matched?
What, he came back
from the dead?
Wouldn't be his first time.
Just because someone is dead
doesn't mean they
can't have a voice.
Give us enough time,
we speak for the dead.
On the roof, Edgar Munsen was
spouting off about starting a game.
The recording says there are
four more potential victims.
Four people fighting
for their lives.
God...
Okay, we're in
the countryside somewhere.
I can't make out
any landmarks, nothing.
Oh, God.
Who's doing this to us?
I have no idea.
What's your name?
Ryan.
And what's your sin, Ryan?
Sold bad mortgages,
sold good coke,
cheated on my taxes,
cheated on my wife.
Both of them. So, you know...
Nothing that bad.
What's your story, lollipop?
It was my husband's fault.
Oh, come on. Bullshit.
Why... Why am I being punished
for something that he did?
Huh?
If he hadn't fallen asleep,
he wouldn't have rolled over
<i>and suffocated our baby.</i>
It's not my fault.
No, no. No!
For real, you don't think he's
trying to tell us something?
Look, there are two perfectly
good doors right here.
Right, so we'll go through the door
that leads exactly he wants us to go?
No, thanks.
No, Mitch is right.
I don't think this is...
Back the fuck up.
Man, get that shit
out of my face.
Oh, my God!
Help me! Help. Please.
Ah! What the fuck?
There's wires,
there's something...
Help, help.
Anna? Do you see?
There's 100 wires wrapped around his leg,
and around some pulleys.
Okay, there's, uh...
There's some kind of handle.
Guys, there's a tape.
It's tighter!
It just got tighter!
Oh, God!
Okay...
God! Oh!
Okay, how do we get the tape?
Hey, go slow.
Yeah, careful.
Really slow.
Okay, okay.
Careful. Careful.
Please, be careful.
Oh, God.
Careful, careful, careful.
Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, my God!
You guys aren't helping!
Grab the tape! Grab the tape!
No way, man.
No, you gotta
fucking grab the tape.
I saved your fucking life, Mitch!
Grab the tape!
Just do it!
Please.
Please, yeah.
Yeah, come on.
Come on.
Come on, man.
Oh, my God.
You almost got it?
I'm trying, dude.
You got it, you got it.
All good, all good.
You got it?
Oh, God, oh, good.
You got it?
Play the tape, Mitch.
Play the tape.
Here, you play the tape, man.
<i>There are no
shortcuts in life.</i>
<i>Please forgive
the rather crude example</i>
<i>I will make of your decision
to not follow the rules.</i>
<i>Pull the handle
and you will be set free.</i>
What does he mean "set free"?
Good luck, lollipop.
Oh, God.
Hey, prelim report
on Buckethead.
It says the particles found
on the body are animal feces.
Cow, chicken, pig.
They also found traces
of Aujeszky's disease.
Aujeszky's disease?
It's a virus.
Mostly known because,
when swine get it,
farmers have to wipe out the entire sounder.
I'm impressed.
Keep digging.
Maybe I can track
the virus to a location.
Dr. Nelson?
Another one,
possible jumper.
Any identification
on the victim?
No. Looks like
the same killer.
This was on the body.
No link so far
to any of our suspects.
Is it Kramer?
Do you know?
Is this crime
related to Jigsaw?
Think it's any coincidence that Edgar
Munsen happens to be a guest here?
I think it's highly unlikely
he woke up from a coma,
climbed on a roof,
and threw a girl off.
But I did check with the ICU.
He's still there.
Looks like acid.
There's a depletion of adenosinetriphosphate
in the muscles fibers.
Rigor mortis.
Clearly, she didn't
die from the fall.
It's hydrofluoric acid.
Look, here. This is
the injection point.
The vein carried it all the way
to the heart, where it's singed.
How do you know
it was hydrofluoric acid?
Saw a lot of it in Fallujah.
Never injected, though.
A puzzle piece.
Jig-fucking-saw!
What's Logan's deal?
What happened in Fallujah?
Uh, he, uh...
He got captured.
Um, but not before
taking out three Taliban.
Uh, what I heard,
they tortured the shit out of him.
He spent months in the VA
hospital when he got back.
You think he snapped?
Come on, man,
you're talking about a brother, here.
I got a brother.
He's a fucking asshole.
What do you think
about his second, Eleanor?
She's got a great ass,
big mouth.
Seems to get off
on this sick shit.
Motherfucker!
What the fuck?
Oh, fuck.
I'm a good person.
I'm a good person,
I don't deserve this.
I confess...
I confess. I con...
I confess that
this is fucked up!
What?
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys!
Somebody turned on the TV.
Hello?
Yeah, we got one, too.
I'm going to
have to lift you.
What?
We gotta get the remote.
Okay, fine.
Got it?
Got it!
No! No!
No!
<i>In the past, you have all put

Ryan!
Ryan!
<i>Ryan!</i>
Get to the handle!
I can't!
<i>Please, Ryan!</i>
Hurry, man!
Ryan!
You have to do it!
<i>Get to the handle!</i>
<i>Ryan, pull
the fucking handle!</i>
<i>Please!</i>
What's your story,
sweetheart?
What are
you asking, Detective?
You one of those,
uh, kinky types?
Like a little pain?
Why?
You want to get punished?
Too late.
Already got an ex-wife
that tortures me every day.
Maybe you deserve it.
Probably.
Where were you the night
Malcolm Neale got murdered?
Home.
Alone.
Cool.
Oh. Can you prove that?
Do I need to?
<i>Come home soon, Daddy.</i>
I will.
I'm sorry you have
to stay so late again, Judy.
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>
All right, sleep sweet, Mel.
I love you.
<i>Love you too, Daddy.</i>
Love you, bye.
<i>Bye.</i>
Logan.
How did you
find Eleanor?
My assistant?
Is that all she is?
It's been two years since
Christine passed. It's just...
I wouldn't blame you.
Yes, but I'm a professional.
Uh, Logan,
you ever heard
of a website called
"Jigsaw Rules"?
No.
Buried deep online.
Took some digging,
but it's a site devoted to Jigsaw.
Half of it's
bullshit, posers,
but there's some stuff on there
that is really messed up.
A lot of sick fucks.
Okay?
We did a darknet IP trawl.
Got a lot of hits
from your assistant.
She's a regular.
Downloaded some shit
you cannot imagine.
So you're saying that Eleanor
Bonneville is our copycat?
No, that's not
what we're saying.
Did you
check her alibi?
Uh, she said she was home
the morning that Buckethead
was found hanging in the park.
At 7:00 a.m.? Home alone?
A single woman?
That does sound suspicious.
All right, let's rewind.
How did Eleanor come to you?
She sought out the department
to do her residency.
And after that?
After she finished
her residency?
I mean, three months ago,
she was offered a job
running the show
at the Cleveland city morgue.
Why didn't she take that?
Would you want
to move to Cleveland?
That's the lab.
Results are in.
Okay, so this is
the DNA of the blood
scraped from under the fingernails
of the first victim, Malcolm Neale.
Yeah, Buckethead.
Can you ID it?
Already did.
This is a blood sample from
a perp taken a decade ago.
You might remember the case.
It's an exact match.
Whose blood is it?
John Kramer.
What?
That's impossible.
That's a fact.
The blood under the fingernails
of our first victim
is John Kramer's blood.
The Jigsaw Killer.
Ryan!
<i>Help!</i>
<i>Ryan!</i>
<i>Help!</i>
<i>Pull the lever!</i>
Ryan!
Uh...
<i>Get to the handle!</i>
<i>Ryan!</i>
Help, now!
<i>Ryan!</i>
No!
Go to hell!
You gotta help us out, man!
Help!
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
Ryan!
<i>Pull the handle, Ryan!</i>
<i>Pull it!</i>
Ryan!
We're gonna die in here!
Please!
<i>For the love of God,
just pull it!</i>
If we die, you die!
God...
Turn it off.
Oh, God...
Ah!
Here's the GPS location
on Ms. Bonneville's cell.
Great.
Is Jigsaw dead?
Did Kramer die,
or do we have proof?
What do you have to say to
all the panicked citizens
who want answers?
Turned your phone off?
And yet here you are,
you found me.
You'd make
a good detective.
Or maybe I'm
just too predictable.
Predictable? No.
Halloran's passing
the blame around.
He's looking at us.
Yeah.
They're watching my house.
Because he thinks
your alibi is shit.
You really love
that guy, huh?
First year at County,
clean case,
a predator by the
name of Alistair Schultz.
Halloran roughed him up
while he was in custody
and the lawyer used that
to get him off.
The very next day, he kills
an 8-year-old girl
who shows up on my table.
The first of many.
Halloran can't help himself,
can't get out of his own way.
So, no, I don't have
much love for the guy.
Well, it's a job, Logan.
You can't make it personal.
When you have
a little girl one day...
Why didn't you tell me about
the job offer in Cleveland?
Because you would
have told me to take it.
Yes.
Yes, you're damn right
I would.
It's complicated.
We are past complicated.
When Buckethead
was strung up,
I wasn't at home
like I told the cops.
I was at my, uh...
Studio.
What studio?
And why couldn't
you tell them that?
Like I said,
it's... It's complicated.
You don't think they're
going to find out about it?
They know about
the Jigsaw fan website,
whatever the fuck
you're doing on that.
They're going to find
out about everything.
El, they think
I'm involved.
Show me.
Okay, I should
warn you, because...
Can you turn the lights on?
Eleanor,
what is this?
Hey, a girl's
gotta have a hobby.
A hobby? Is that
what you call it?
- How about a stamp collection?
- That's a hobby.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Supposedly, John Kramer
designed this trap
for a game that took place
before all the others.
They found
the plans in his lab.
I built it myself.
Got them from some
guy on the Internet.
Rumor is, not only
did John design this,
he built one.
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint,
but none of Kramer's victims
died in any device like this.
The wounds don't
match the design.
Well, maybe the bodies
were never found.
And maybe it never happened.
Maybe someone's
playing games with you.
What are you doing
with all this stuff?
You need to get
rid of it, now.
Great work.
Now we've got probable cause.
You're not going
to believe this.
What?
The Commissioner wants
to see Jigsaw's remains.
Wants proof
he's really dead.
What?
Yeah.
Said he wants to
calm the peoples' fears.
Are you serious?
Chasing a dead man.
This is election
year bullshit.
That is all yours.
I'm going to follow up on these.
Right on.
Halloran.
He's in a fucking coma,
how does he just disappear?
He's still breathing.
What is it?
It says my name.
You know what happens
if we don't follow the rules.
<i>Hello, Mitch.</i>
<i>You've admitted to
selling a boy a motorcycle.</i>
<i>But you have not told
the entire story, have you?</i>
<i>$600 for a bike that you
listed in excellent condition.</i>
<i>Even though you knew
the brakes were faulty.</i>
<i>You took his 600 bucks</i>
<i>and, in return,
you delivered him to his end.</i>
<i>He was my nephew,
and he never hurt anyone.</i>
<i>The device you see here
has a unique power source.</i>
<i>It's the same engine that graced
the bike you sold my nephew.</i>
<i>However, I assure you,</i>

Look, you're right, man!
<i>Avoid the dangers around you,</i>

<i>Live or die, Mitch.</i>
<i>The choice is yours.</i>
Shit!
No, no, no!
Oh, shit.
Look, I'm sorry! Stop, please!
I'm sorry about your nephew!
Anna, help!
Get the fuck up here!
I don't want to die!
Stop! Stop it!
Stop!
Anna, you got to help me!
Hurry up! Hurry, please!
Please help! Hurry! Hurry!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
Mitch, pull the brake!
Pull the brake!
Oh... Oh, God.
Anna, you did it!
You saved me!
Anna... Anna,
get me out of here, please.
You did it!
Man, you did it!
No, no, no!
Edgar Munsen was in a coma.
You got one job!
One job to do,
you useless mother...
Yeah.
Anything?
<i>Nothing.</i>
Pulled a Houdini.
Nobody saw shit.
Just pulling Kramer's casket
out now.
<i>Reporters?</i>
Yup.
Good.
End this nonsense
once and for all.
<i>John Kramer is dead
and has been for 10 years.</i>
<i>Enough of this
John Kramer bullshit.</i>
Uh...
You may want to rethink that.
Why? What's going on?
Let's just say you can call
off the hunt for Edgar Munsen.
Oh, come on!
<i>Okay, get a warrant for Bonneville,
I'll see you there.</i>
Go, go, go.
Move, move, move. Go!
Let's go.
Take the left,
two on the right.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Clear on the left!
Clear!
Watch your left.
Eyes up.
You in?
Jesus!
Two left.
So, what, Bonneville
just leaves a body
hanging in her studio?
Come on, man.
I know.
I'm gonna go
pick up Logan.
I'll get the girl.
I'm gonna need you to show me those wrists,
brother.
I didn't do anything, Keith.
Look, listen, listen.
I have photos of you.
Yeah, you and Eleanor in your
warehouse of torture devices.
Wait, you were there?
Yeah, I was there.
I just saw a third body that looks
like it's been through a meat grinder.
All right. Someone is trying to frame us.
All right?
I want you to tell me
where Eleanor is.
- The studio I can explain.
- You just have to trust...
Do you know where
she is or not?
Keith, I'll tell you
everything I know.
I know who did this.
And you do, too.
Who found the body
at Eleanor's studio?
Jesus!
Halloran.
He had motive.
He wanted Edgar dead.
Who ordered the targeting
<i>of the remote?</i>
If he moves to trigger it,
blow it to shit.
Go on.
Yeah, everybody
targeted the trigger,
but did anyone actually see
what Halloran was aiming at?
He had no plan
to let Edgar walk.
Do you think your partner
knows that you're with IA?
So, I'm right.
Jesus.
You know, I've been onto Halloran
since before all of this started.
IA has him connected to multiple
homicides going back years.
Now these latest
Jigsaw murders...
<i>The three bodies
we brought you,</i>
<i>we found they're all mixed up
in Halloran's cases.</i>
Bring him in.
Halloran is trying
to frame me.
I don't even know
what he's got against me.
Really?
You know you called him
out for screwing up
slam-dunk cases.
You said he was
a moron in the press. Twice.
No, I said he was
an impulsive asshole...
Twice.
You blame him for what happened
to Christine, don't you?
Look, I don't know how to
prove Halloran's the copycat.
It's Halloran. It's him.
Let me help you
build your case.
Let me get you proof.
Let me open up Edgar Munsen.
We match that slug
to Halloran's gun.
What kind of firearm
do you use?
Glock 22.
Most cops do. Except Halloran.
He's got a 17.
9x19 Parabellum.
That's a Glock 17.
Okay.
I'll take you home.
You stay there until I call you.
I'll get Halloran.
El, where the hell are you?
Call me, it's urgent.
Jesus!
El!
I've been trying to call you.
I don't know
how that body got...
No, no, no. It's okay.
They don't think
it's you or me.
They have their sights
set on Halloran.
I found it.
I think I know where
the game is being played.
I found the farm.
That's great,
let's call a detective.
No!
Halloran's behind this.
We can't trust the cops.
What? You want to see
this game for yourself.
You get off on this shit?
Logan, this is a chance
for us to save lives.
So, we're going take on
a serial killer with what?
Our cunning intellects?
And this.
Anna!
Don't leave me!
Anna?
Anna, I'm
bleeding out, Anna.
Motherfucker!
Anna!
Okay...
Anna!
Don't leave me, please!
Hello, Anna.
John?
John Kramer?
What's going on?
You're about to play a game.
Oh, no.
No. What are you doing, John?
What are you doing?
It's a final test.
I already
passed your test!
Look at my
fucking leg!
That wasn't your test, Ryan.
And that wouldn't
have been necessary
if you'd simply played
by the rules.
But you don't like rules,
do you?
You want me to show mercy?
You, who hasn't taken
even a single step
toward confessing.
You, who is responsible
not for one death,
but for three?
<i>Your life of reckless deceit</i>
started in high school.
And only grew worse.
Sit down!
Sit the fuck down!
Get the fuck off me!
<i>You lied to the authorities</i>
multiple times, Ryan,
pinning the blame solely
on the driver,
your deceased best friend.
Do you know what you did
to his family? Hmm?
And you've only gotten
worse over the years.
I did it.
Okay, I fucking did it.
I did it,
but it was so long ago.
I want to live.
I want to live.
As do I, Ryan.
As do we all.
But things happen.
<i>Were it not
for a careless mistake</i>
<i>by a resident
at the hospital I was in,</i>
<i>my cancer could have
been diagnosed a lot sooner.</i>
<i>It was simply
the wrong name on an X-ray.</i>
Would've saved me
a whole lot of hardship.
And you, Anna?
I didn't do anything, John.
You know me.
Please don't do this to me.
We were neighbors,
Anna and I.
My first chemo sessions were very difficult,
to say the least.
Anna and her husband,
Matthew, were so kind,
so supportive.
I thank you for that.
Why are you doing this to me?
<i>Those were better days
for you, weren't they, Anna?</i>
<i>But your
poor husband, Matthew...</i>
<i>I know the two of you
didn't always get along.</i>
<i>But to have to endure that tragedy,
the death of a child, that's, uh...</i>
<i>One of life's
greatest burdens, isn't it?</i>
<i>If only he hadn't
fallen asleep that night,</i>
then he wouldn't have
rolled over and, uh,
suffocated your baby.
That is what happened,
right, Anna?
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up. Shut up!
I mean, it's horrible.
How horrible,
to have to live
with such a thing.
<i>It could make
a person go mad, couldn't it?</i>
What are you going
to do to us?
Me?
I'm not going to do anything.
You have to simply
assume responsibility.
For who you are.
This is it.
How do you know this is it?
Tuck's Pig Farm.
It was shut down due to an
outbreak of Aujeszky's disease.
Buckethead's sample.
The pig virus.
This farm was
in Jill Tuck's family.
Jigsaw's wife.
Still is.
Although the place
was shuttered years ago.
Well, it looks like
somebody's here.
You sure you want to do this?
Halloran, it's Hunt.
Call me back.
We're at Halloran's house,
but he's not here.
You got a location on him?
Searching.
Sir?
Okay, we need
to bring him in. Now!
Check this out.
That's a lot of blood.
What's to bet this is where
Buckethead was decapitated.
It's Jigsaw.
Jigsaw is dead.
Is he?
Please...
I'll do anything you want,
John, just please let me go.
Please.
Did you know that pigs are
highly compassionate animals?
They show distress
if they see any other animal,
including humans, suffering.
What about you, John?
Where is your compassion?
We all have a thumb
on the scale, Anna.
For good or for evil.
You've been weighing in on
the wrong side of the scale.
Both of you.
Now, if you want
to achieve your freedom,
you have to learn.
You have to realize that you've
been doing it backwards.
So...
I'm gonna give you
an opportunity
to turn it all around.
Here's your key to freedom.
It's all up to you.
Now, the game's simple.
The best ones are.
You have one shotgun.
You have one shell.
Like I said, it's up to you.
How can you say
Jigsaw isn't dead?
He's dead.
Autopsy was performed on his
body and he has his own grave.
He's not.
Jigsaw lives forever
through the work
of his followers.
You.
You've been obsessed with
John Kramer from the start.
The website.
The traps you built.
Lots of people are
fascinated by Kramer.
You know damn well
I didn't kill Buckethead.
Or the other two.
Then who did?
Halloran.
You said it yourself.
The bullet matches.
He's connected to
all the victims.
He's right behind you.
Drop it.
Drop it! Both of you.
Now!
It's him.
It's him!
Go on.
Don't. Don't.
Come on.
Come on!
All right!
Don't.
All right.
All right,
I'm putting it down.
Now it's your turn,
sweetheart.
Come on, sweetheart.
No...
Come on.
Put it down.
I'll blow his
fucking brains out.
El.
Yeah.
That's a good girl.
All right.
You got what you...
Run!
He wants us to
shoot each other.
He wants me to kill you.
No.
No. No, don't!
No, don't touch that,
you psycho bitch!
It's the only way!
No. No. No, okay?
No. No, please don't.
Because that's what he wants us to do.
Okay? Think about it.
Thumb on the scale.
No. No, please don't.
Okay? Please.
No, no. No.
Good or evil.
No, please don't.
That's what he said.
Let's just think about this for a minute,
okay? Just think.
We're supposed to follow the rules,
we have to play by the rules.
My only key to freedom
is to kill you.
Please!
Please don't! Please don't!
I'm sorry.
Please don't, please don't.
Backwards...
He said we've
got it backwards!
No!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
No. No.
No!
No.
<i>No. No.</i>
Here's your key to freedom.
No. No.
No. No.
We could have been free, Anna.
I'm sorry.
Halloran.
Help! Somebody!
Help!
What the fuck are these?
What the fuck?
These are
goddamn laser cutters.
What? What?
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, what happened?
Where's Eleanor?
Halloran!
Someone came out of nowhere.
Drugged me. Knocked me out.
Yeah, me too.
<i>Hello, gentlemen.</i>
<i>You came looking for the game.
Congratulations, you found it.</i>
<i>You are the final two players.</i>
It can't be.
<i>You may recognize the device</i>
<i>around your collar,
Dr. Nelson.</i>
<i>These laser cutters</i>
<i>slice through tissue,
and bone, like butter.</i>
<i>The most powerful blade
on the planet.</i>
<i>You both have
an opportunity to live.</i>
<i>All you need to do is confess.</i>
Confess?
<i>It's that easy.</i>
<i>If you admit to the reason
that you deserve to die,</i>
<i>you can escape death.</i>
<i>I will be listening.</i>
<i>Make your choice.</i>
How are you alive?
How are you still alive?
<i>The game
will select one of you</i>
<i>to begin in 60 seconds.</i>
<i>Unless, of course,
someone chooses to go first.</i>
Let's neither of us
touch a button.
We're both gonna
be fucked in a minute.
I'll go first.
Okay.
Wait! No, no, no, no!
No! No!
Oh, God.
I've done nothing wrong.
No, stop. Stop it!
Stop it!
I'd confess.
Okay, okay.
Okay, all right!
All right, John Kramer!
It was me!
It was me! I fucked up!
I messed up your X-rays!
<i>I was... I was careless.</i>
And I am sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I confess.
I confess.
Christine,
I'm so sorry, baby.
I should have been
there for you,
but I wasn't.
<i>Your turn, Detective.</i>
No! No, no, no!
I won. I won. I won.
What? Huh?
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit.
<i>Confess.</i>
Okay.
I did some shitty things.
But the system's broken,
I tried to fix it!
Okay! Okay!
- I tampered with evidence.
- I took bribes.
I put innocent people away.
Murderers and rapists walked.
People died because of me.
Innocent people died
because of me. I did it!
It fucking can't be.
What?
Hey, hey, hey...
Wha...
What is this?
What are you...
What?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Logan, you're... What?
What? Hey!
What, you...
You're working with him?
I am him.
What?
And with a little help
from you,
no one will ever suspect it.
<i>People died because of me.</i>
<i>Innocent people died
because of me. I did it!</i>
I don't understand.
Ten years ago,
in this very barn,
a game was played.
Supposedly, John Kramer
designed this for a game
that took place
before all the others.
<i>The bodies were never found.</i>
I know this because
I was one of the players.
<i>Jigsaw put me in that game
almost 10 years ago.</i>
<i>I mixed up his X-rays.</i>
You need to cut yourself!
<i>John decided I shouldn't have
to die over an honest mistake.</i>
<i>He gave me a second chance.</i>
<i>So now, 10 years later,</i>
I've recreated Jigsaw's game with
criminals from your failed cases.
What?
<i>I wanted my game
to be identical to Jigsaw's.</i>
<i>So I went through your cases.</i>
<i>Found players just like
the ones in the original game.</i>
<i>I gave them the same choices
that Jigsaw did a decade ago.</i>
<i>Jigsaw put five people
in his game.</i>
<i>I put in three.</i>
<i>You and I are the last two.</i>
I wanted to see if
I was as worthy as him.
As talented.
No...
Come on, Logan.
Come on. Have mercy.
Like you just had mercy
on me?
When you started our game just now?
Pushing my button?
Saving yourself.
What?
That... that's not fair!
Fair?
Why was Edgar Munsen free?
<i>He was a murderer.</i>
But you were protecting
him because he was
your criminal informant,
years ago,
and you let him walk free.
Edgar Munsen
killed my wife.
You don't...
You don't know that.
It's never been proven.
This won't bring
your family back.
John Kramer,
gave people a chance
to win the game.
A choice.
Fuck!
You fucker.
You have a choice.
Scream, or don't.
Logan, Logan, Logan.
Logan, hey,
look, I can help you.
I can do things for you.
Can you bring
my wife back?
Doesn't matter
what I say, does it?
<i>I created a game that
appeared to be run by Jigsaw.</i>
<i>Hello, Edgar.</i>
<i>You're about to play a game.</i>
<i>Five lives are in your hands.</i>
<i>Follow my
instructions exactly.</i>
I got to choose who dies,
them or me.
I'm not fucking dying.
What kind of firearm
do you use?
Glock 22,
most cops do.
Except Halloran,
he's got a 17.
9x19 Parabellum.
That's a Glock 17.
The blood under the fingernails
of our first victim
<i>is John Kramer's blood.</i>
<i>Some will think it's Jigsaw.</i>
<i>Some will suspect you.</i>
<i>But no one will suspect me.</i>
Okay, we need to
bring him in. Now!
<i>Because Eleanor
will provide my alibi.</i>
Oh, yes.
<i>Ten years ago,
I came out of the war a broken man.</i>
<i>Jigsaw put the pieces of
my life back together again.</i>
<i>He gave my life purpose.</i>
We can never come from
anger or from vengeance.
You taught me that.
But then there
will be no justice.
No.
But there will.
Because we'll speak
for the dead.
<i>Together,
we built a legacy.</i>
Now, I speak for the lives
ruined by people like you.
Murderers, rapists...
Their victims appeared
on my table
because of you.
No. No.
No...
No...
I speak for the dead.
