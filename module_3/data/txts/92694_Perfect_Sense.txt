<i>There is darkness.</i>
<i>There is light.</i>
<i>There are men
and women.</i>
<i>There's food.</i>
<i>There are restaurants...</i>
<i>Disease.</i>
<i>There's work...</i>
<i>Traffic...</i>
<i>The days as we know them,</i>
<i>the world as we
imagine the world.</i>
- Hey.
Hey.
How would you feel
about heading home?
- I've only just fallen asleep.
- Well, you have.
I haven't.
I have a tough time sleeping
with someone else in the bed.
- You're kicking me out?
- I have to go to work soon
anyway.
- We danced and drank
all night.
We go back to your place,
you fuck me,
and now you wake me up
and kick me out?
- I can't sleep with
another person in the bed.
- That's funny.
- That's just the way it is.
- I didn't know you'd
started smoking again.
What do you feel like doing?
- Throwing stones.
- At what?
- Seagulls.
<i>- Sweetheart...</i>
You'll find someone.
- Shut up and throw.
I suppose I should
go back to work.
- Come.
Poor baby.
- Lebanon?
- Morocco.
- Morocco.
- Now, that's funny.
- What's funny?
- Seeing you today.
- Hilarious.
- Just come with me
for a minute, will you?
They want us at the hospital.
- Aren't you going to ask
why I haven't been to work?
- Well, you've been sick.
- Not sick,
just unhappy.
- Well, it's the same thing.
- Unhappy on account of a man.
- No kidding?
- So what are we wanted for?
- To see a patient.
- Why?
- What's going on?
- We're just going to find out.
- Well, you know,
he's really pissed off in there.
- Excuse me.
When can I take him back home?
<i>- We'll just need
to talk to him, so...</i>
- He needs to explain
the whole thing again?
<i>- Well...
- Look. Look, listen.</i>
He called me up, right?
And he told me
he was coming home.
And then all of a sudden,
his voice breaks,
and he bursts into tears.
- Mm-hmm.
- And then he starts
telling me that he doesn't see
any meaning to life.
I mean,
he's not usually like that.
He's a truck driver.
- Okay.
- And then he pulls over
at the side
and says he's fine again,
except he can't smell anymore.
- He can't smell anymore?
- Well, I told him
to find a hospital,
because, you know,
that isn't normal, is it?
- Hello, Donald.
Stephen Montgomery here again.
- Hi, I'm Susan.
- Hello, Stephen.
Hello, Susan.
- You can't smell anymore?
- That's right, Susan.
I can't smell anymore.
- But is your mood
back to normal?
- I've been sitting here
for nearly 11 hours.
My mood is not great.
- But you don't feel
any discomfort
other than a lack of smell?
- No, Susan.
- And has anybody else
in your family or at work
had similar experiences?
- I haven't got a clue,
'cause I'm sitting here,
aren't I?
What do you want from me?
- I just want your opinion.
- I'm an epidemiologist,
Stephen.
So why am I
talking to this guy?
- Because we've got seven more
just like him in Aberdeen.
There's five in Dundee,
11 right here in Glasgow,
18 in Edinburgh.
There's over 100
reported cases in England.
They've got them in France,
Belgium, Italy, Spain.
They've all appeared
in the last 24 hours.
- How were they infected?
- I'm not sure they are.
- Meaning?
- Well, all the early
indications
suggest no connection
between them at all:
no contact, no pattern, nothing.
Is my wife still out there?
Let me speak to my wife.
Please, let me
speak to my wife.
- Maybe it will just go away.
- So we won't panic.
- Hmm.
- Michael, that's a table of 12,
just sat down.
- Where are they, the bar?
- Yeah, in the bar.
- Where's that lobster
and haggis?
I need that right now.
That's table 5, mains.
- You're a world-champion
asshole, by the way.
What's the matter with you?
- What are you talking about?
Those starters
for table 7-
- That girl was such
a sweetheart.
- What girl?
You just fucked her
and dumped her, didn't you?
Poor little baby.
- Where's those salads?
- Okay, one oysters, one soup,
an antipasti,
two duck,
and a steak, rare.
- Yes, Chef.
- I would have
made her breakfast.
Strawberries,
heated the milk for her coffee.
Why don't they want
to fuck the nice guy?
They want to fuck
the asshole.
- The next two checks
at the same time, please.
- Yes, Chef.
- How about those ravioli, boys?
How long on those?
- Three minutes, Chef.
- Right, right, right.
- Chef.
- Okay, how do you
know it's fresh?
- We smell it?
- No, check the eyes.
The eyes should be clear,
and gills should be red,
not pink.
It should be firm
when you hold it.
And the smell?
- Fishy?
- It can smell fishy.
But if it smells fishy,
then it's not fresh.
It should smell like the sea.
Does it smell like the sea?
- Mostly smells like fish.
- Richard, get me another
fucking sea bass.
- How's the scallops coming?
The table's been waiting
ages now.
- One day.
One day, son,
you'll be in love,
and you'll be miserable.
Table 7.
That's your karma.
- Hot pot!
- Truly in love and miserable.
Richard,
I need that pot back!
Richard!
Hi, Jen.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Really?
- Do you want
to come with me?
- Of course I do.
- Great.
I can find someone else
if you're too busy.
- Don't worry.
It might not be that serious.
I'll call you
as soon as I know more.
Okay?
You wouldn't happen to have
a spare cigarette?
- I'm on the phone.
- Who's that you're talking to?
- Oh, nothing.
It's just a guy.
He's asking for a cigarette.
Yeah.
Okay, okay, bye.
- Have you got a light?
- How about board and lodging,
while we're at it?
- No, I don't even know
your name.
Do you have one, though?
clang!
Shit.
- Oh, dear.
- I'm Michael.
I work in the restaurant there.
- All right, sailor.
- I'm a chef.
- Good for you.
- Come on, guys.
What we got?
- We've checked all
the Scottish cases,
but we have no obvious match.
There's no proteins mutating,
no prions, nothing.
- There's nothing
to say it's a virus.
There's nothing
that matches anything we know.
- But it's fair to say
it isn't obviously contagious.
- It's fair to say
it's spreading.
- Okay.
- It could be environmental.
It could be a toxin
we know nothing about.
- It could be terrorism.
- Okay, so it's not a contagion.
<i>I'll tell them... probably
disappear in a short while,</i>
and don't panic.
- Maybe they put
something in the water.
<i>Overwhelmed with grief,</i>
<i>people are hit
with all that they've lost...</i>
<i>Lovers they never had...</i>
<i>All the departed friends.</i>
<i>They think of all
the people they've hurt.</i>
<i>First overwhelmed
with grief...</i>
<i>And then no sense of smell.</i>
<i>That's the disease.</i>
<i>They call it
Severe Olfactory Syndrome,</i>
<i>SOS.</i>
<i>- This is obviously
a cause for concern</i>
<i>and requires a heightened
state of alert.</i>
<i>But it's not a cause
for alarm.</i>
<i>- We stand ready
for the arrival</i>
<i>of the first
confirmed case of infection.</i>
<i>- According to
the World Health Organization,</i>
<i>stepping to level five</i>
<i>doesn't automatically mean
that we raise our...</i>
<i>They say it isn't contagious.</i>
<i>But who dare believe that?</i>
- Nothing.
- Well, should we
call it a night?
- I don't know what the fuck
we should call it.
- Let's go chase
some pretty ladies, huh?
You chase.
I'll pick up the pieces.
- I don't feel like it, James.
- Come on.
You want to watch that, Rich.
That's what happens when you
have too much high-class fanny.
Engorging himself
on Europe's finest.
I'm going to get
the ENTONOX, quick!
- What's that?
- ENTONOX.
Laughing gas.
Saint Nitrous,
patron saint of pastry chefs.
- Richard, don't, don't, don't.
It will make you feel-
James, leave him alone.
James!
- I recommend it for you
especially, sir.
- James, put it back.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop.
Sniff my finger?
- Yeah, I smell that.
- Smell that?
- Oranges.
- Wrong.
Balls.
Man down!
Man down!
Quickly.
Evacuate, evacuate.
- Good night.
- See you later.
- Cheers, boys.
- Good night.
- Keep smiling.
- Bye, James.
- Got your own smokes tonight,
sailor?
- I'm still a chef.
- My dad called
everybody sailor.
He worked in the docks
all his life.
He never went sailing
anywhere,
but he called everybody
sailor.
- All right.
- Even people he didn't know.
"Hello, sailor.
Good-bye, sailor."
- Well, you can call me sailor
if you like, or Michael.
- When I was a child,
I thought it was
really embarrassing.
Now I'm doing it myself.
- Are you hungry?
People aren't eating
in restaurants these days,
and we've got a lot
of spare food.
- This is monkfish cheek.
Fish is my thing.
Good?
- Mmm.
I'm a bit greedy when I eat.
- Oh, that's all right.
- I had a disorder
when I was younger.
Just trying to catch up.
- So what do you do
when you're not eating?
- Death and misery.
- What?
- I'm an epidemiologist.
- I'll get you
something sweet.
This is a mango jelly
and chocolate macaroons.
<i>And...</i>
I didn't make these.
I can't remember what the fuck
that's called.
But I think it's got
coconut in it.
- God.
All that sailor stuff,
it reminds me of him,
my dad.
I miss him so much.
We had so much fun together.
He could always
make me laugh.
- Oh, hey, hey.
I'll, um-
Let me get you-
Here.
This is clean.
- Thank you.
I'm okay.
- Here, here.
You're all right.
- Do not stand so close.
You never know.
- Oh, no, they say
it's not contagious.
- We don't know.
That's just something
we tell people.
- Look, would you like me
to take you back to your home?
Yeah?
Come on.
You take that cloth.
Come on.
- Shh.
Oh.
Hey.
- It's gone.
The smell, all gone.
<i>- Well, I...</i>
It was a crazy evening.
- Yeah.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.
Good morning.
Mm.
Well, it has its benefits.
- Yeah.
We were in Algarve once,
Maggie and me.
We came home,
had a freezer full of food.
There'd been a power cut.
Never smelled anything
so disgusting in my life.
I'll never forget it.
- Maybe you will.
- Mm.
- I've met someone.
- Okay.
- I'm pathetic.
I'm not even sure I like him.
- Okay.
- Actually,
I think he's a smooth asshole.
- Look.
It will probably come back.
But at the moment, our customers
won't be able to smell,
so it'll be a bit like cooking
for snotty-nosed people.
Bring out the big guns,
all right?
- Maybe a bit of saffron.
<i>- Oregano...</i>
<i>James...</i>
<i>Life goes on.</i>
<i>The food becomes
spicier, saltier,</i>
<i>more sweet, more sour.</i>
<i>You get used to it.</i>
<i>The greater loss
are all the memories</i>
<i>that are no longer triggered.</i>
<i>Smell and memory
were connected in the brain.</i>
<i>Cinnamon might have
reminded you</i>
<i>of your grandmother's apron.</i>
<i>The scent of cut hay could
evoke a childhood fear of cows.</i>
<i>Diesel oil might
bring back memories</i>
<i>of your first ferry crossing.</i>
<i>Without smell, an ocean
of past images disappears.</i>
- Whoa.
I'm off work.
- Congratulations.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Any more news
of death and misery?
- Not really.
- I was a really good smeller.
- I bet you were.
- I was.
Do you want a cigarette?
- No, thanks.
- Something else, then?
- Like what?
- Oh, are you hungry?
- No.
- I can cook you
something special
or buy you a lollipop.
We could go for a coffee
and eat apple pie and licorice.
A glass of wine?
Some fresh air?
- Come on.
- My sister got married here
a few years ago,
and I came to stay
for a month.
- Met a guy.
And then good job came up.
- And now,
ladies and gentlemen,
we'll call upon a new smell:
the scent of the forest
after spring rain.
We imagine the path
underneath our feet.
We see the green
moist color surrounding us,
and we feel the wet branches
against our faces.
And now imagine,
we pass between the trees.
- Come on, come on.
- And we begin drawing in
the air
deep inside
and enjoy the moment.
The humidity level is high.
At the lower end,
there's the moss, the fungi,
the rotten leaves.
In the middle tone is the tall,
fresh grass:
a crisp and almost
invigorating scent.
And at the top,
we feel not only
the leaves and the rainwater
but also the sky.
On a day like this,
we can smell the sky itself.
- What should we do now?
- Well, now you could
invite me back to your place.
- I don't know if I will.
- Well, you can just start
walking home,
and I'll follow you.
- Oh!
- Whoa.
Mm.
I should have made
a better effort to sniff you
the first time
we were lying here.
Mm.
What a pity.
- What do you want?
- What do I want?
- Yeah.
- Well, soon I'd like
to close my eyes
and try and go to sleep,
which is a big deal for me,
'cause usually I can't sleep
in bed with someone.
- I need to be by myself.
Okay?
- Now?
- Now, yes.
- You want me to leave?
- I live here,
so I guess you'll have to.
- Now?
- Yes, please.
- Did I say something wrong?
Let me give you my card,
in case you want to,
you know,
call me or something.
- You have a card?
- I had a catering company
that didn't do very well.
Not very many clients,
lots of cards.
You can call me.
My number's on there
and my address.
<i>And I guess you know
where I work, so...</i>
- Repent, sinners!
The day of the Lord
is upon you!
Do you know that this is
the day of the Lord?
The prophecy has been spoken!
Do you pray?
Are you aware of your sins?
Come back and be aware!
This is the day
of the prophecy!
- Hello.
- No flowers?
She loved flowers, Michael.
- Ian got married in a church
with the full monty.
- Apparently she's pregnant,
his bride.
- And what about
this Michael?
- What about him?
- He sounds nice.
- I don't know.
I usually pick assholes.
- Well, they can't all
be assholes.
They just can't.
- I'm trying to take care
of myself.
- Right.
You do that a lot,
don't you?
- Fuck you, sailor.
- Let me see.
Hmm.
Ta-da!
- What do you say?
- One for you,
and one for you.
- Not soap.
Big soap,
big soap.
Apparently big tobacco,
big fizzy cola
have formed this cartel
to start selling-wait for it-
fruity-flavored oxygen.
In order to create
a proper market for it,
they've enlisted big soap.
And big soap have flooded
the environment
with enough
organophosphates
to temporarily disable
your central nervous system.
That's why I've stopped washing,
in case you were wondering
what the smell was.
- Will you get to-
You don't half talk some shite.
<i>Environmental groups are sure</i>
<i>it's the start
of an ecological apocalypse</i>
<i>caused by pollution</i>
<i>and genetically modified
plants and hormones.</i>
<i>Intelligence claims it's
an attack on the free world.</i>
<i>All indicators point
to fundamentalists.</i>
<i>The fundamentalists
talk of God's punishment</i>
<i>on a world of unbelievers</i>
<i>and promise that all pure
people with the right faith</i>
<i>will regain their sense
of smell</i>
<i>in the final days.</i>
<i>Others talk of a degenerate
capitalist system</i>
<i>that has released a military
virus to stimulate the economy.</i>
<i>And there are other theories.</i>
- Wake up!
There's so much hatred
in the world!
There's so much hatred!
So much hatred in the world!
- Stephen, calm down.
- They're going to blow us up.
They want to destroy us.
So much hatred,
so much hatred.
- Shh, shh, shh.
- So many sharp edges.
So many sharp edges.
- It's okay.
- Sharp things.
- I've just given him
as much sedative as I dare.
It'll kick in
in a second.
- So many sharp edges.
- It's okay.
- We are so soft.
- It's all right.
- We are so soft.
- Hey, are you all right?
- I can't die alone.
- I'm here with you.
I'm Barbara.
I work in research.
I've seen you in the canteen.
- That's how it'll end.
- Oh, now, just calm down.
What's your name?
- I keep thinking about it.
You know, you see this thing,
your body.
It betrays it-
it betrays itself.
- Michael, come on.
- No, listen.
Your body takes away
the color of your skin.
- What?
And it betrays you.
- Michael, Michael, stop.
Can I get some water
over here?
- It's okay.
It's okay.
- Pissing and bleeding,
and fucking pus
is coming out your ear!
I've seen it.
I've seen it.
At the end,
you're all alone.
- Don't say that.
- James, you'll die
on your own.
- It's not true!
- So dark!
- Don't say that!
You're not on your own!
Michael, stop it!
Michael, don't say that!
<i>First, the terror.</i>
- Don't leave me.
Don't leave me, Michael.
Don't leave me.
Michael!
<i>And then a moment of hunger.</i>
- What's happening?
What's happening?
<i>Oh, oh, no...</i>
<i>This is how the sense of taste</i>
<i>disappears from our world.</i>
<i>They don't even have time
to give the disease a name.</i>
- Do you think we'll lose
our other senses too?
- Smell and taste
are related.
They're the two
chemical senses.
- So the other ones might be
all right then?
- They might.
- We'll just have to wait
and see.
- That's right, sailor.
- And what happens
if you're wrong?
Then we're fucked.
- Oh.
Hey.
- Hi.
It's still out there.
- What is?
- The world.
- What can you see?
- People.
- What are they doing?
- They're heading off
to work.
- What should we do?
- We go to work as well.
- Do we kiss each other first?
- Maybe.
- So we'd like to see
each other again?
- We probably do.
- Maybe even this evening.
- Maybe.
- And I'll be looking forward
to that.
- Yes!
I may not even have
a job anymore.
- Forget it, Michael.
We're closed.
We're closed.
- We'll open again.
- People can't smell.
They can't taste.
They're going to buy
flour and fat.
I mean, that's all you need
to survive.
Take a hit on that.
Go on.
Go on.
Drink that.
Now, that is
damned expensive brandy,
damned, damned expensive.
But you might as well drink
surgical spirit or sniff glue.
It doesn't matter.
It's flour and fat.
- And yet it does matter.
- There's no difference.
- No, I think you're wrong.
Life goes on.
- They'll come back.
People will ask each other
out to dinner again.
They'll toast each other
in there
while we take care
of their needs.
- And serve them
flour and fat.
- No, anything but
flour and fat.
We'll be all right.
<i>Slowly,
things return to normal,</i>
<i>and life goes on.</i>
<i>People do what they did before
as best they can.</i>
<i>Within a few weeks,
taste becomes a distant memory,</i>
<i>and different sensations
take its place.</i>
<i>In restaurants, it's all about</i>
<i>offering another person dinner,
letting yourself be waited on,</i>
<i>listening to the trickle
of wine</i>
<i>and the clink of glasses.</i>
- "Not only has the food
received special attention
"but also the temperature
of the food and its consistency.
"And we tried it all,
"from the freezing cold
to the scorching hot.
"It was dry, it was moist,
it was crisp,
"it was spongy,
it was crunchy,
"and it was all
at the highest level
"up to and including
the dessert,
"a light pudding
with caramelized nuts
"and a bright orange sorbet
and a dark blue-
dark blue coulis on blackberries
and black currant."
Chew on that.
- Great.
- Life goes on.
- My dad let me shave him once.
I was eight.
I managed to do it
without a single scratch.
I was very proud.
And then he went to the sink,
and he shaved himself
all over again
as if I hadn't been there.
I was devastated.
- Your turn.
- Pff!
Here, try.
It's soft.
- Hmm.
- Yeah?
- Mm.
- Want to go dancing?
- Sure.
- And get drunk?
- Sure.
- And smoke cigarettes?
- Always.
- There's still pleasures
in the world, eh?
- Let's have them,
all of them.
- Yeah.
Here.
I got soap in my eye.
- Let's play a game, sailor.
- What game?
- It's called,
"Make Me Special."
- What are the rules?
- Only one.
Just tell me something.
- Something?
- Something other people
don't know about you,
something secret.
- Like what?
- My sister's got two kids,
and sometimes I hate them.
I can't have children.
My ovaries are crippled.
My eggs are no good
because of not eating.
I pretend that I'm not
that into them,
that I have
an interesting job.
<i>Anyway...</i>
I can't have them.
Your turn.
- I had a girlfriend.
- You don't get this game,
do you?
- No, I had a wedding planned.
And she got sick.
She got really sick.
You could smell that there
was something wrong inside her,
like something damp,
something from the basement.
I didn't stay with her.
I didn't look after her.
I ran away.
I make myself go
and visit her grave.
At first it was once a week,
and then maybe it was
once a month
and now less.
I go there to feel guilty,
you know?
I thought I would feel guilty
for the rest of my life,
but actually,
it's starting to fade.
- You're an asshole.
- I am.
- It works.
It works.
You're making me yours.
- I'm an asshole.
- So am I.
- A couple of assholes.
- Mr. and Mrs. Asshole.
- This is the situation
here in Bangkok, Thailand.
We call it
"Severe Hearing Loss Syndrome."
We still do not know much
about it.
Anger, rage, hate,
and then they go deaf.
- And how does it spread?
- I can't hear you
very well.
But I don't know what to do.
Tell me what to do!
Standing there looking at me!
- I think it's okay
to panic now.
<i>And that's basically
what the world does.</i>
<i>Severe Hearing Loss Syndrome
spreads from Thailand</i>
<i>across India to China,
Russia, and beyond.</i>
<i>Rage,</i>
<i>anger, hatred,</i>
<i>and then the loss
of another sense.</i>
<i>All the unaffected can do
is wait.</i>
- Ta-da.
- Can you still get film
for those?
- Yeah, I got some
from my uncle.
He was a collector.
- What did he collect?
- Polaroid cameras.
- Incubation period's dropping
all the time.
It's down from 24 hours
to about 11,
very aggressive.
Yeah?
Yeah, we stick
with the 2006 plan.
- Stephen?
- Okay.
It's still valid.
Isolate the first ones.
Get ready for loads more.
- They're saying a child
was born in Berlin
with all its senses.
There might be a chance
of antibodies.
- What's going on?
- Somebody is infected
on the third floor.
They've sealed it off.
- Who owns this restaurant?
- Me.
- You're shutting down.
- Give me a fucking break!
- Everywhere is shutting down.
The council wants to have you
and your staff
to cook for the quarantined.
We got thousands of people
holed up in their homes,
sports arenas.
They all need to be fed
three times a day.
Here is your menu and budget
for the coming week.
- Municipal food?
- There is plenty of other
restaurants who'll do it.
If you don't want the job,
just say no.
That's all I need to hear
is a no.
- Hey, all right.
We'll do it.
- How very moving.
You'll have us in tears
in minute.
- Fuck you.
- Look, we're just
trying to do our jobs.
We're trying to keep
everything working.
- Bouillon and fusilli?
- Make sure that pasta
is al dente.
- Fat and flour.
Fat and fucking flour.
- You're homeless.
- Shit.
<i>- Stay away from anyone</i>
<i>showing symptoms
of aggression.</i>
- You can choose between a gym
full of those not infected
out behind the bus station,
or you can come home with me.
- Tough one.
- What?
Oh, Jesus.
- So all of a sudden
we're living together.
- Yeah.
Mr. and Mrs. Asshole.
- We could play
"Make Me Special" games.
We could play at lovers.
We could fuck.
But you're just like
all the others.
Don't you think that you matter,
'cause you don't.
You're nothing.
You're just passing time.
It's not difficult
to understand.
It's just fucking and eating
and fat and flour.
You go out there,
you lie down on your back,
and spread your legs.
Or else take your profound
conversations
and your emotions
and fuck off.
You're just a pair of ears
and a mouth,
an asshole and a cunt.
And it might surprise
you to know this,
but everyone else has that too,
a pair of ears and an asshole,
fat and fucking flour.
Nothing special
about this one,
except that she's infertile.
Fat and flour.
Fat and flour!
Fat and fucking flour!
Fat and flour!
Fat, fat, fucking flour!
<i>- Let me in!</i>
<i>Let me in!</i>
<i>Take me with you.</i>
<i>Hey, hey, come on.</i>
<i>Let me in.</i>
- Hello?
Can you hear me?
- Pardon?
Seen anyone else?
- I hope you can hear this.
Whatever I said to you
I didn't mean.
It wasn't me.
It was the disease.
- It was not you.
It was not you.
It's not me.
It's nobody, nothing.
Nobody is here, nobody.
Disease: which disease?
Where is it?
Where are you hiding,
you fucking cunt?
Where are you?
- I need you
to come back to me.
- Take that, nothing!
- I need you to believe me.
- It's me.
- Why?
Why, why?
- It's me asking you
to come back.
- Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why?
- I love you.
- You're all fucking liars!
<i>There are two movements now.</i>
<i>There are the people
who run through the streets</i>
<i>grabbing all they can,</i>
<i>people who don't believe
in anything</i>
<i>but the end of the world.</i>
<i>Then there is
the other movement:</i>
<i>farmers going out
to milk their cows,</i>
<i>soldiers reporting for duty...</i>
<i>Those who believe that life
will go on somehow</i>
<i>or just don't know what else
to do.</i>
<i>People prepare
for the worst</i>
<i>but hope for the best.</i>
<i>They concentrate on the things
that are important to them...</i>
<i>All the things beyond
fat and flour.</i>
<i>Once we thought of the Ice Age
as something that crept up,</i>
<i>glaciers slowly spreading,</i>
<i>temperatures gradually
dropping.</i>
<i>But recently,
a number of intact mammoths</i>
<i>have been discovered
with stomachs full</i>
<i>of undigested grass.</i>
<i>The cold must have hit them
like a blow from a club.</i>
<i>That's how the darkness
descends upon the world.</i>
<i>But first,
the shining moments...</i>
<i>A shared flinching
of the brain's temporal lobe...</i>
<i>A profound appreciation
of what it means to be alive...</i>
<i>But most of all, a shared urge
to reach out to one another...</i>
<i>To offer warmth,</i>
<i>understanding,</i>
<i>acceptance,</i>
<i>forgiveness,</i>
<i>love.</i>
<i>It's dark now,</i>
<i>but they feel
each other's breath,</i>
<i>and they know all
they need to know.</i>
<i>They kiss,</i>
<i>and they feel each other's
tears on their cheeks.</i>
<i>And if there had been anybody
left to see them,</i>
<i>then they would look like
normal lovers,</i>
<i>caressing each other's faces,</i>
<i>bodies close together,
eyes closed,</i>
<i>oblivious to the world
around them,</i>
<i>because that is how
life goes on...</i>
<i>Like that.</i>
