FBI, go to the side.
Come on.
No, you get your post until
I'm at your house.
Do not make me put aside.
- I'm at your house when I get there.
Get out.
Hands in the air. What's wrong with you?
Did you already stopped, I had to chase you.
Leave it to me please do
not take in the bushes.
Just give me what I want.
- That's a federal offense.
Only the postman hits the post.
You realize that I have to say.
Yes, I can have one in your ass stabbing.
Just do quiet.
- Do I Have?
Quiet. I got your post here.
Credit card interest without opening.
No, not at all.
- Fair enough.
Steam Clean Carpet Service?
- No.
True. Duke University.
Come here. Give me that.
- No.
Come here.
I know this was a big decision, but
you won the "mad dad" award.
My boy is accepted.
Thanks.
Do not be surprised if I
lose your tax refund.
Trent.
Are you there?
You are on your way.
Dessico Tree.
- Hi.
I have to talk my wife Sherry.
- Sorry, no calls allowed.
I know, but ...
... It's an emergency. Our
son was just accepted.
Your wife is in complete isolation
for the next 72 hours.
Come on, it's a mental, physical treatments.
It's not Area 51.
- Breathe with me.
I will not breathe with you.
Namaste.
I must ponytail your head?
Namaste.
- Hello?
Duke University.
- What?
Malcolm?
- That you speak it.
Jason Bourne.
We do not use code names.
You ruined the fun.
What you need, Nick?
The exchange is tonight at eleven.
Do you have what they want?
- As long as I get what I want.
I think of Bali.
- No witness there.
But we will look after you.
Well, then Mexico. But not to Cabo.
Too many tourists.
CALL: TRENT
- Chocolate.
Hi, Malcolm.
- Where are you?
In the library.
- The library?
There is noise.
- It 'Book Appreciation Day.
We need to talk.
Come home soon.
- You're breaking up.
The Prodi
-G is what hoarse. I'll be back.
Library?
- How did you find me?
The Agency traced your mobile.
Thank God my father's orthodontist.
- Mine sells German schnitzels.
Now let's talk.
Scratch and Rembrandt are my family. You
can say anything with them there.
Family?
In my family we each other kick their ass.
And now I see a lot of butts to be kicked.
Something like this.
A great day, Mr. Turner.
We love you, but do not kick my ass.
Hold on. Sell ?‹â€‹some CDs.
Why do you shame me so?
- Do I? You have much to learn.
Me "daddy" may call sometimes.
Let's start over. That's gotta be a nice day.
I brought the rain with it.
There is good news came.
- Yes, she called me.
Wait until they hear my new
stuff. I'm really doing well.
What are you talking about?
Wait, where are you talking about?
- About Duke.
No, forget college. A supervisor took
my CD mix well.
The Achievement. Volume 1.
He will do a tour with young talent ...
... In the fall and winter
called "The Freshman Class.
The entire Eastern Shore and Cincinnati.
People do not go to Cincinnati.
There they go away.
The snag is that I am not yet 18, so ...
... I want you to sign
this contract. Because the Prodi
-G is a minor ...
... Only in age.
You are now accepted at Duke.
You're a Blue Devil.
And then?
- That's your dream.
No, that's your dream.
I'm not going to show a boring
college while I go make money.
I do not sign that contract.
You need to rest.
- This is my big break.
If the contract was not signed on ...
... Five days is a rapper
from St. Louis along.
You have your whole life to go on a tour.
But the next four years ...
- Four years?
You're joking, right?
Do you know how long it has
been years in Hip Hop?
Come on, Malcolm, look here.
It is a blueprint for a house of success.
Built on a strong current.
A strong current?
You have a diploma required.
What will you do when that flow dries?
- Then I let it fill up again.
Every time you open your mouth
and you tell me ...
... How important that degree is.
Fortunately, your mother here with that
crazy talk from you.
Let us call mama.
From her can 't do.
- Yes, call her.
And if you tell her that the university
you want to throw away ...
... Jumps down her vein on her forehead.
But not if she sees the house
I'm going to buy it.
I just sign a check for Duke.
End of story.
Gotta go to work now. Some work.
I work to destroy me. Do you understand?
- I understand you.
Do you understand?
But I'm talking about swimming
pools. Even private security.
We can do it together.
Damn.
How you doing, man?
- Has he signed?
No, not yet.
Phase two: Put him in the fall as he 's work.
He draws so to be rid of you.
Robberies on the job. I see.
That's right.
- That's why I pay you.
Hands off your chest, you screwed
up the exposure so.
You have the stick, right?
Completely blank.
- Clever, huh?
Really now?
- No, it's insurance.
I thought, what if they give me the money?
And what if they stick just as I check?
The real is hidden in a safe place
where no one looks. Do not worry.
Idiot. Where?
- Where is my witness protection plan?
In a coffin if you do not say where.
Georgia Girls School for Arts.
- What?
A buddy of mine works there.
- Unbelievable.
Crawford?
Yes, Malcolm.
Canetti took a nepstick it.
He told me where the real
one, but there's no time.
Chirkoff but it must change.
We go.
Canetti, can you hear me?
- Yes, I hear you.
If something goes wrong, go away.
Hi, guys. Vlad and Dmitri, right?
Hello, Mr. Chirkoff.
Good to see you.
Rosetta Stone.
I, G Prodi.
- What are you doing here?
My future capture. Sign my contract.
Put you down and stay crouched.
You think I'm stupid?
You think I'm stupid?
Probably a very intelligent man. I
do not know so well.
Signs, please.
I'm not talking to you.
- Who is?
Against the person on the other
side of your chest.
This? There is none.
This is part of my hearing aid.
Get out and hide now.
- What's happening?
I am hard of hearing in my right ear.
- Really?
Show me.
- Is not that sits within ...
Quietly, I show you everything.
- FBI.
'll Tell you here.
Want to come play?
Drop.
Canetti give me if I kill him.
Music.
- What?
It's all in the mu ...
I have not seen anything.
Are we okay? Come on, man.
Come on.
They shoot. Where are we going?
Get in the truck.
Get down.
Okay?
- I think so.
Any idea how lucky we've had?
You could have been killed.
What were you thinking?
He shot the guy down just for me.
- We're alive.
That's the key.
- Should we not call the FBI?
No, the FBI has a snitch.
Chirkoff knew we were.
I want to go home.
- Your car is there.
They probably already have it checked.
They know everything about us.
Chirkoff just saw you murder
someone. Not go home.
What then? Is he going to murder me?
Come on, that's no joke.
- That I will not allow.
I just need to stick out ...
To Chirkoff forever in the cell.
Revenge is everything. Canetti told me
where the stick is plugged.
We are going to hide until I got him.
Just do quiet.
Breathe easy.
They have not yet been reported and
do not know where they are.
You're the FBI.
Where is a good leak if
you can tell me anything?
Send me the picture.
How's your leg, boss?
- Good.
The FBI checked the cars.
Rental cars. They leave the zone.
Not yet, anyway.
And the stick?
- Turner knows where that is.
If we find him, we find the stick.
Our biggest problem is his child.
He saw me shoot Canetti.
I want him dead.
I have mp3's of original fifteen
things that have not mixed.
That you may have.
Georgia Girls School for Arts.
- Just do what Paxman did.
After I got shot in the street,
then a double jam '.
Stop the idiotic chatter, we get out of here.
Biggie probably also thought that when
he 's got tons.
Or Pac when he was chillin 'on the boulevard.
I have a plan.
Promise me one thing.
- What?
Let them do no pure version of Walmart.
Preserving what was the Prodi
-G.
I'm going to hide.
- Hide?
How can you hide something like that now?
Only a psychiatrist can find out.
I saw you when you were little and
your mother you ... wanted to do.
She promised never to tell. I pretended.
You are a difficult child,
Charmaine Pierce Daisy.
Who are you talking about?
- My cousin.
Talk like her, to frighten someone.
How do you do?
Yes, that way.
Remember that tone.
Well, I like a girl should
be, rather than a fine.
I buy my own clothes though.
And pull that skirt down. I'm
so into the promised land.
It's down.
After a while you realize that it
is not worth the fight.
I was not talking to you. What
do you interfere with it?
Waiting.
How do we find a big stick in
a 2.5 cm 3 cm pocket?
A pal of Canetti works here. We need
to find out who that is ...
... And what they know.
Canetti, yes.
Canetti told me something just
before he died.
He looked at me and said ...
What did he say?
- It's all in the music.
Sort of. He recognized my talent and
knew who set the Prodi
-G was.
It's all in the music?
Makes no sense.
Like everything else that you are spouting.
And two fat ladies who wander you?
They show a vacancy for a house mother.
What?
Shake your ass.
Hi, girls.
They expect me. I'm a little late.
Come inside.
Can I help you?
- I'm the one that helps you.
With these poor defenseless girls housewife
waiting for a positive example.
Hattie May Pierce, to your services. But
do not call me Big Momma.
You emailed your curriculum for
the house mother vacancy.
Very convenient, but ...
- Well, thanks.
I would watch them if it were my children.
But, Miss Big Momma, there are
no interviews scheduled ...
Look what these kids I visited.
Visual Arts, my ass.
- Beverly, for goodness sake?
Two layers? That the school can ...
... And I have to pay to bring my own sweets?
Nobody deserves to be treated that way.
That's the worst yet.
- Damn.
You may well stop now you have your hair
from left to right can be laid.
You promised us a notice period of two weeks.
Every day you do not demand respect ...
... Every time you die "a little. You too.
She's right. Nothing is worth
living with those demons.
No child left behind? Just watch.
I step on.
Can you start today?
- I?
Thanks. Absolutely.
We do not pay very much ...
- Do not worry about.
If I could be so poor, we went to KFC ...
... And ate the rest of others, because the
chicken was too expensive for us ...
... And we licked the juice from the chicken.
There is a small problem.
And that is?
Hi, how are you?
Miss Gail, this is my
cousin, Daisy Charmaine Pierce.
Hello.
So many girls. It's like Baskin
-Robbins.
So many flavors.
It's so diverse.
Yes, we are proud.
Tell me, Charmaine, for you GGSA?
Yes.
I read a lot and ...
... Love to play music. And I ...
... Lust like salad. Delicious
fresh fruit salad.
She had an exciting few days. She's
with me because of family problems.
My parents support my art is not. They
find it a waste of time.
Terrible. You've come to the right place.
And my stepfather works continuously.
- An important job for the government.
Which he is spying on me.
- If you're lying though.
Charmaine, you may attend classes until
you have placed ...
... But since the school year to a close,
we have no roommate.
Each girl is good.
- We would not be a burden.
Charmaine remains with her Big Momma.
My psychiatrist and guardians say I'm
better off with a peer.
You're on the same floor as Mrs. Pierce,
before you realize you know somebody.
Charmaine will be fantastic.
Welcome to your new home.
I show you rooms. Some girls
have been eating ...
... So you see them there. But there is Mia.
Damn.
Mia, this is your new
house mother, Big Momma.
And this is her niece,
Charmaine, your new classmate.
Mia is a promising actress.
That's it.
I can do comedy like Sandra
Bullock. For the Oscar.
I do have my reach. Like Kate Winslet does.
Mrs. Alt and movement says I to
my inner voice to listen ...
... But there are so many screams
and last forever, Delante retreats.
Delante retreats.
I gotta go now.
- You need a hug.
She is quite emotional. Who is Delante?
Delante is her boyfriend.
Maybe we should freshen up before dinner.
The transition is a bit much for Charmaine.
I think she must lie down for a moment.
I understand completely. Your room is at
the end of the corridor.
Look at that wallpaper for once. Nice.
Look, there's a ballerina on the bed.
I'm Jasmine.
What you probably did not
hear from your tour.
I am here to say.
If you stay out of the
way we have no problems.
Listen to me, Tinkerbell.
Big Momma to take orders from anyone.
Nobody.
Well, we'll see about that.
'Tower Girl' is fun.
I'll unpack.
Can I?
With such beautiful young ladies sit.
Sorry.
Go find a place.
- Come sit beside me.
Well, thanks.
Careful. I make it clean.
I'm Haley Robinson.
You're that sexy girl from the Promenade.
- Sorry?
You're not sexy.
It was hot in the Promenade.
The day I saw you.
You're not sexy, it was hot in the
Promenade the day I saw you ...
... I'm hot.
I'm Charmaine.
- You're funny.
I have not introduced myself yet.
My name is Hattie May Pierce.
But everyone calls me Big Momma.
- That's the understatement of the century.
Very funny.
And this is my cousin.
Charmaine Pierce Daisy.
I realize something.
You must do something before you eat.
Of course, girl.
- Attention, everyone.
We have fresh meat to eat.
And what school is this?
- A school for the arts.
Exactly. And that means ...
... That every new student to dance,
acting, or singing before dinner.
As Latia I mean. What is your talent?
Let us see what you can.
Silence.
Charmaine's not feeling well.
Maybe she can do it another night.
It's okay. I got it.
What will it be, Charmaine?
- I'm a rapper.
I can not wait to see this.
Can anyone give me a 'B' indicate?
Hi, our girls school ...
Girls are you in love?
Is everything okay?
Nobody ...
That's not a meal.
- I'm on a diet.
Prima ballerinas should not have breasts.
There is a law or something.
She looks so skinny that she
can dodge rain drops.
No raindrop ...
Mia, what is it?
- Delante has just broke.
Need space. Still friends.
He used to kid with sunglasses.
He's just a little confused.
He is afraid of intimacy. He
will not be hurt.
You think?
- Can you not read?
A man needs space. That is
clearly black and white.
Whether he was stiffened by his
passion, and he ...
... He does not know how to deal with it.
That kid with the sunglasses means
he hides his true emotions.
He loves you.
Child, as my aunt used to say ... Urima
... It's better for the rest
of your life alone ...
... Than one minute but to be in bad company.
The rest of my life alone?
I can not.
I just wanted her ...
Well done. Want more breaking hearts?
Calm down, ladies. Thanks.
I have an announcement.
Last night, a stolen antique music box ...
... From the special collection
of the library.
I know there is a tradition of jokes.
This is not like the boys steal
the mascot of St. Ignatius.
Those still missing.
This is a crime against something of
ourselves. That will not be tolerated.
I recommend therefore, that the guilty
party, or anyone ...
... Who knows anything about, himself or
herself or risk immediate suspension.
The music. Canetti was trying
to tell you that.
What do you mean?
- The stick is in the music.
We go to the library. There he was stolen.
Where are you going?
- Those shoes hurt.
The heels. And that crawling inside string.
I can not do it.
Stay in your room and stay
away from the girls.
Good. I gotta pee.
Delicious.
I'll be there.
Is everything ok there?
- Yeah, fine.
I'll be there.
Damn. I mean, hey Haley.
Nothing personal mind you, but
you wear granny
-panties?
Granny
-panties?
- Of those remedies?
Those works that way, without those
extra rolls of fat.
Those extra rolls of fat.
About 15 minutes they have something
for me in the lounge.
Come if you want.
- How nice of you. Nice.
Then I see you so.
- Good.
Put on your pajamas. We make it easy for us.
You got it.
Excuse me.
Jeez.
It looks just as good.
The name is Hattie Mae Pierce. But
everyone calls me Big Momma.
I'm Kool Kurtis, I make the ladies drool.
That's nice, but I love my
saliva in my mouth.
I used to be road manager for Run DMC
You recognize me firmly Krush Groove fake
old guy at the carwash.
No.
- I had no life, but I was good.
My last tour was with LL Cool J.
As the great master says, "Mama
Said Knock You Out".
Young man, I am a woman with grandchildren.
I am the new house mother in Price
Hall and I explore things a bit.
I wondered if I could just
look around in the library?
Kool Kurtis is only for
you behind the scenes.
Kool Kurtis, let me be your monkey.
Light ports. My mother said ...
... Women with thick legs murder me.
Found my keys.
You coming?
- Which way?
Hale Berry's nothing compared with thee.
I'm definitely in heaven.
Who has America's sexiest baboon invited?
I've invited her. Be nice.
You were a beast to sacrifice?
We are the divas. The senior
society of GGS best artists.
This is our sanctuary.
She ratted on us?
- I do not rat.
That would be a verlinker say.
- That's true.
Good point.
- Good point, girl.
I'll tell you something about
Daisy Charmaine Pierce.
My ex
-boyfriend, Marlo ...
... What was the dealing.
They involved me in a conspiracy
and he said ...
... If I testified against
him, I could shake.
You know what I did?
- What did you do?
My 15th birthday in prison.
My birthday cake was ...
... From a four inch thick
mattress and a Twinky.
Terrible.
We are here tonight to
welcome our newest Diva.
Haley Robinson.
Stand.
This chain is a requirement. An obligation
on your life as an artist.
That you or your friends will
never give your art.
Do you accept that?
- Yes.
Congratulations, you're a diva.
- Where's your chain?
The lock had to be made.
Welcome to the Diva's.
The Noggle class music box.
The first graduating class who gave
it to the school.
If you opened it, he played the school song.
Not worth much, but it is the sentiment.
Why would anyone want to steal it?
Unless there is something worthwhile
going to happen.
- It was a long time.
Between you and me and the director, I
think the girls have stolen him.
Are you sure?
- Last night I make the living room clean ...
... And I hear the
girls giggling and sneaking.
I look inside and they run
away. And the music too.
I saw a guy in your
office. He did look familiar.
My vismaatje. Tony.
He certainly had something in the
newspaper. That shooting Canetti.
That's it.
He left a few days ago
for his monthly poker game.
Damn shame.
These hairpins falling off.
Listen, Big Momma, I have a few
holy eyes on my visor.
Big Momma is a monogamous woman and
she must return to her girls.
Even a mommy bear needs some sugar.
- I said that's enough.
God, I forgive you the 90 years.
Thank you, Jesus, for the present.
As entertaining.
All back to your room. And besides ...
... To declare that the thief
has stolen the music ...
... The lights go out for eight hours.
Get out.
No sour faces. Hurry.
Stare at me like that.
Shed not give me that.
We're already gone.
Tim Way is a good thing That never works.
What is wrong with you? You could
at that girls stay away.
I did some undercover
work. Information gathering.
Undercover? Why you lie to
lounge in lingerie.
I did what girls do.
You should listen to my plan.
Your plan?
- They think I'm on their side.
Exactly.
- The Diva's say nothing to you.
This house does not like you.
Do you think the Jacson Five
Papa Joe told everything?
No, Janet knew everything. And
I'm their Janet.
Who are the Divas?
- Really now?
The most popular girls in school.
The best artists. They lead
the whole thing here.
You need me.
I am a seasoned FBI agent.
I have heavier chores done than to
deal with as a girl group.
Love you now but hiding it,
I'll do the undercover work.
What you want.
I just wanted to help.
- Help please stop.
Never mind.
Where did you find Jasmine's necklace?
How do you know this is Jasmine?
You do not need me. You have heavier ...
... Things settled it as a girl group.
Good. Maybe I can help.
If I help you, please help me.
- What?
You need to sign my contract.
- I'll think about it.
Then I read again my Cosmo.
Good.
Nothing. Only 100 of these.
Not bad.
Turn it off, idiot.
Come on. I know how to find them.
Charmaine, you're late to your class.
Now go to ballet.
Plier.
Knees over your toes.
Breast up. Shoulders back.
Aside, and plier.
And up.
- Do not.
Groups for the routine.
Jasmine, up.
In the row.
You okay?
Dear Lord.
Charmaine, hurry.
Slower.
Now I know why it is called the Nutcracker.
I was running.
Have you seen this boy?
- No.
I'm looking for that Prodi
-G. Did you see him?
I am a record producer. I would
like to talk to him.
Really? I'm his DJ.
I'm his partner.
You're his partner, but his sidekick.
Have you seen him?
- Not since Sunday.
The Prodi
-G sometimes pulls back his demons to train.
I give you my card. If you see him, call me.
Then we might do business.
- Definitely.
Business sounds good.
Let me see that map again.
Why should I go to art?
Because you are a student and
you may not be unmasked.
So send me to art?
- Shut up.
You must be our new student, Charmaine.
Just in time for modellendag. There
is our nude model.
Dress but when you're ready.
Of that art like I do.
No, nobody shows up naked.
That is shameful.
- What do you mean?
This is a fine art class.
We study the human form.
This is fine art. And she looks fine.
Besides, we are with other women.
Of course, I know.
But whatever you do, if
this woman undresses ...
... Then you reinforce a terrible stereotype.
92.6% of women in this country ...
... Have size 12 or larger.
Really?
- And with the media images ...
... Girls who say they would not be happy ...
... Unless they are skinny ...
... That disrupts our body image.
That causes eating disorders and Alogia.
Sorry, young lady, you have a small body
but a great head of hair.
There is talk about ...
- Do not listen to her.
She has hot flashes. Go ahead, girl.
Let us see what you have.
Wait.
I think I agree with Big Momma.
Is that so?
- Yes.
We never had a curvaceous model.
Shameful.
Shameful.
- What do you think, Big Momma?
Excuse me?
- You should be our model.
Amen.
All safe here. Tubes are fine.
You should be our model.
- Big Momma dresses for anyone.
Come on. You're beautiful.
- I know, but I do not.
No.
I have more pastel needed.
I have a great sheet needed.
Do not I have some grapes
or eat a cheeseburger?
As you do is you have an inspiration.
Class, time for a new pose.
Artist, a new sheet.
So?
- Very good.
Let it drape down.
- What?
Not so shy. Like you said ...
... These girls are an example.
Roles I have, but those are not
the one you want ...
Let it all hang.
- That you certainly will not.
Let us see how a real woman looks like.
There is fire. Get out.
Fire. Your hair. Be careful not to burn.
I let the students back inside.
False alarm, ladies. Back to the classroom.
Hello, Big Momma.
In the sheet wrapped around
you look like Aphrodite.
More like the son terribly thick and juicy.
Meet my wonderful cousin, Charmaine.
How are you, Charmaine?
- Typically, Big Momma.
The more she resists, the more they want you.
With those eyes byonce thighs and Rihanna.
Mia wants to commit suicide.
That's terrible.
- I know.
I gotta go.
- Hurry up.
Come on, it's Mia.
- Nice thighs.
Curtis, I go to the front.
Do you have free?
- I am now.
Then come shopping.
I must get dressed first. What
is all this ...
Blood. Has anyone called 112?
You said she wanted to commit suicide.
I want to die.
- You have too much to live for.
Quiet. Tell what happened.
We had bought hair dye at Walgreens ...
... And the manual was in Spanish.
She has taught French.
Do not you know that cheap hair
dyes as an old man?
It does not last long and
the damage and the furniture.
I thought if I looked different that Delante
was in love with me again.
You certainly looks different.
He must love you for everything you
can buy in a store.
If he does not, do not change yourself.
Change your man.
Feel the deeper meaning? Think about it.
And my hair?
- I gotta go.
So that we wash off.
Not.
- Certainly not.
This.
- I'm not sure I am.
I know you are. Trust me.
Want it?
What do you mean? We share it.
What are you waiting for?
Take off your clothes.
Come to think just. Be right back.
You okay?
- Fine.
Nothing feels better than a bastards
out of your hair washed.
Big Momma always mixed my own South
Bleu and shine with a product.
Please.
- Vaseline?
God's gift to black people.
If you're out of the bath and
the baby has diaper rash ...
... And your hair looks like it
exploded, just to rub it.
Notice how my magic works.
Please.
You're a genius. Thanks.
I have just brought out the beauty.
Come here. Big Momma must talk to you.
What do you know about the missing music box?
Jasmine and Isabelle met someone
tonight at the library.
With what?
- No idea.
I heard them say that Isabelle
takes it in her bag.
You look great.
- You too.
You look nice today.
- Definitely.
Let's go out after your big show.
- You just formed with Mia.
Help me heal.
Come on.
I'm here if you change your mind.
What a slime ball.
- Do you have a boyfriend?
Really. I think the boy is
not what I'm looking for.
And you?
- My boy does not really exist.
I know someone for you.
- Really?
Who?
- My nephew Trent.
Nice, honest, he's our age ...
... And he is a hip hop lyrical miracle.
You just might have seen in the Promenade.
He calls himself there ...
- The Prodi
-G.
Who finds himself quite a bit. Talks
about himself in the third person.
And think all the girls sitting behind him.
Your cousin is the last guy I would take off.
What is your type?
- Artistic.
Sensitive, also interested in others.
And he likes long, slow sweet long kiss.
Take you kidding?
- That's exactly Trent.
From the outside he is all dressed up, but
when you get to know him ...
... He is a sweetheart. You may be a couple.
He wanted to go to the show tomorrow.
Perhaps you could then do something.
Can I meet him before?
- No, tomorrow.
And tonight?
Then he does.
- Good.
Kool Kurtis alone.
- Let me see?
Your life is in danger and you go shopping?
Shopping is important for girls.
Like sports. If they do not,
then they talk about.
They drag their parents along to the sales.
Just a fantasy game.
Are you in love with that Haley?
- Out of Haley.
No, she's not my type.
- Good.
Let's go down and intercept.
Not yet. Surveillance is a waiting game.
We can do nothing which we are exposed.
Besides, if Mia takes us into the grind,
let us hope that if the music is ...
... That the flash drive still in it.
So we wait.
Wait, that The Temps?
Not too old for you?
No, I thought of samples for my mix tape.
Can you sing?
- I'd rather hum.
If you can sing I get the vibe,
and a very cool mix tape.
With some old jams on it, we can ...
I like that.
Love how you newschool mixed with
oldschool, I can feel it.
I can jam to. That thing to do.
- What is that?
Something I used to do that
is called Clean & Shuffle.
I need it.
- Two to the right. Two left.
Freak it.
Now stairs. And now run.
Bring it back. Freak it.
Your arms should be a kind of T
-rex position.
Freak it.
- Feels like a militarily?
This is jump, this is ...
This is more Temps know.
- I like that.
More so, so therefore I find
this funny. Not so complicated.
What is it?
- Here are the girls.
Chirkoff is Kool Kurtis come ...
Kool Kurtis ... and let them steal the music.
I can not believe it.
- Trent, pull that dress again.
I is not out.
A security guard with stalkers.
I am a curious woman.
- Come as a drink with me then.
Let me satisfy that curiosity.
Well, a juice. This way?
Haley.
- Trent.
How are you?
Sorry I'm late, that Puerto Ricans are slow.
Have you talked?
- I love long, slow kiss.
It's weird that you say that.
Yes, because you feel you that way anyway?
No, just weird that you'd say.
Well, because rap can not
express my emotions.
And there are many sensitivities that I
want to look like a man.
If an ocean in me. In Portejam
we loose all our sensibilities.
And then we run through, it's like ...
Charmaine's unfortunate that coaching
is for nothing.
I'm going but I think.
No, stay.
Charmaine said you're a beautiful
and wonderful girl.
And those girls are often not ...
- The Prodi
-G?
That's not who I am.
This is not who I am, this is ...
Well, who are you?
I do not know who I
am. I am still investigating.
So do I.
- Yes.
Can we rewind?
- Yes we can.
I'm Trent.
- Haley.
Your champagne, my Goddess.
Put me not now on a
pedestal, which can break.
What are you talking about,
looks like a woman.
A nice lump in my backyard. This is a woman.
You know a man I love with a dangerous side.
Something tells me that Kool Kurtis
not just a man.
Tickling.
I currently have some tension.
- What kind?
Typical stuff, man age things.
What hold hot. That's the story.
Who do you like it down?
- Are you the FBI?
I'm not FBI.
Can you hear this?
- No, I'm not FBI.
I know that.
You're so beautiful, I like you.
You are my high priestess of pleasure.
You have Motownopoly. Let's play.
I have a better game than that.
I must return.
- Really? Why?
Maybe I have some time.
It's Trent.
- Do you have the number of that man.
Call him and tell him we've found our guy.
We found our guy.
This is my crew, Rembrandt and Scratch.
Hi.
- How are you?
Are you ready to sign the contract?
I'm behind on.
- I want to show you something.
Later, guys.
Do that.
- We want you to meet someone.
Tomorrow, Trent.
They are weird, is a long one is short.
I saw that.
We found him.
- Stay with him.
See if he leads you to the father.
Let the games begin.
These girls make me mad.
Do you know Lian Jasmine
and Isabelle Ferala?
- No, refresh my memory.
Left foot on red.
They gave you one hour ago a bag.
Right foot on yellow.
That Jasmine and Isabelle.
These girls may be in big
trouble. And so are you.
Who do you keep that bag?
Someone outside the school?
Do you really see that bag?
Right hand on blue.
- Is it blue?
Yes, blue.
Come to daddy.
Left hand on green.
I think the green. Game over.
No, I got your green.
Go ahead honey, rich at the stars.
- Certainly not.
What happened to your voice?
- You heard me.
Come up with that ass.
Are you a man?
Not again.
- Touch me again and I'll break.
Give me the bag, now.
Do you meet someone ...
- Shut up.
I'm undercover, FBI. Give me the bag.
Give me ...
What is this?
What does a grown man with a rooster?
The girls took it away from St. Ignatius.
The boys school, which are the game cocks.
They want to return after the show.
Want to finish the game?
Come on.
- Where are we going?
You can see it.
- Okay.
I'm away from home.
- This is beautiful.
This is my only chance of
a scholarship for a composition.
With a scholarship I am gone.
Everyone will be there. Juliard,
Berkley, Peabody and Oberland.
I see a beautiful woman
and a beautiful piano.
And nobody plays.
You want me to play?
- Yes.
Now?
- Then I play.
No, do not come to my piano.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Not finding it rough.
It is not there yet. Something is missing.
It lacks nothing, it's tight. You have
to feel, I mean ...
... You need a bit faster.
- Faster?
Yes.
- Yes, better not?
Yes, I like that.
You like that?
- Shall we sing?
Normally I do not sing on
the first date. But ...
Now we go a little higher.
- An octave up?
Yes, one octave.
That song is great.
Not perfect?
- We need to nominate tomorrow.
We?
- Yes, everyone will be overwhelmed.
It's your show, I will look.
- No, you belong here.
I can not do without you. Please?
What time?
- Really? Thank you.
I must return to the room
before I get problems.
It is an overwhelming evening.
- Crushing night? Great.
You're so good with words, why do
not you go to school?
All those writers and poets
that you can study.
I have to strike when the iron is hot.
- Jay
-Z went to school until his 27th.
The world was in a hurry,
he waited for perfection.
I feel quite perfect.
So do I.
There is a curfew.
See you tomorrow night?
- Yes.
Tomorrow night.
This child is here for his
girlfriend, not his father.
Get him, we murder him later.
Now he's ace.
We go get him.
Come on.
Two girls in one night.
- Leave that boy.
Not so much.
Idiots, how could you let him go?
I do not know, but I
know where his girlfriend.
Both.
We do it so.
You want me the secret
of Foghorn Leghorn storage.
Tell me what you know about the music ...
... That missing from the library.
Good girl.
There is a music box in the
library, which is now missing.
Big Momma, I looked up ...
What is the mascot of St. Ignatius here?
Well, I give you to three.
And if no one talking, not you to the show.
One ...
Two ...
They have stolen the bird, they found him.
He walked around and they brought him to me.
Thanks, girls.
- Someone took my advice.
Bring the bird back to St.
Ignatius for his more eggs.
But it's a rooster.
They all taste the same as you ...
... Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Try it.
You. Stop.
Come here.
I know I've had other guys
that you can ignore.
I'll call you back.
Driving.
- I can not. Delante always drove.
Delante I said you do not need. Driving.
Rotate.
I had almost hit him.
- Almost does not count.
Give me gas to drive up 80.
- 80?
You heard me, 80.
Great, now I am followed by a
fat woman in an instruction car.
Here curve.
There. Now I pull the handbrake.
This Go?ár is well controlled.
Drive through, no slow down.
This is still our death.
Without Delante you have nothing to live for.
That's what I do, I have
my friends and school.
That was great.
- Watch out.
What should I do?
- Praying for the airbag.
Whether I do this.
You've learned enough for today.
I'm driving it.
They have been here, so they come back.
They will murder me.
You have not taken off that dress, so
how can they know you were here?
That they do not know, but if it did.
Would you tell me some?
No.
- Put on your costume ...
... And pull out under any circumstances.
Clear?
- Yes.
Do not worry, I like him tonight
when everyone at the show.
Isabel, it's great.
You've really portrayed her.
- There is a lot to portray.
Thanks, hopefully they agree.
Of course.
Do you even heard of Trent? When he goes.
Big Momma?
- Yes, dear.
You knew that I had taken the
cock, but you ratted on me.
This is not my first barbecue ...
... You with your tough attitude,
as if you're already grown.
I am a final year.
- I see who you really are ...
... You're a sweet and sensitive girl.
You and I are the same.
With your iron will carry you care
for people who count on you.
And I'm starving.
The dear child is hungry.
I've also done something else ...
... Worse than the rooster.
She wanted a diva and I said it could do ...
... If she would steal the music.
Who?
- Haley, I let her do it ...
... They had to bring it tonight
so we could put it back.
Where is Haley?
- I just saw her with Mia.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
our annual showcase.
Behold our best and finest young talents ...
Thank you've told me, that was
very big of you.
Now go do your best and make
sure that Big Momma proud.
Then I eat a double cheeseburger ...
... And a regular Coke.
- Go on an extra large.
Hurry.
How often do you hear that I'm sorry?
Sorry means nothing to someone
two times the mistake.
As Urima aunt always said:
You can better your life alone ...
... Than one minute in bad
company. You're bad company ...
... You're a large block of wickedness.
Who is Aunt Urima?
- Mia, have you seen Haley?
She is Charmaine, on the other
side of the stage.
Is that Delante?
And another thing ...
Where is Trent, I have no time.
- Excuse me.
I wanted to tell you.
Trent saves not.
What should I do?
Breathe. It's all good.
You go on stage and do your
best. You do not need Trent.
An original composition by Haley Robinson.
Big Momma, why are you here,
you belong to accompany ...
... There are guys behind the scene.
All right.
Sorry, this should be a duet.
That is still, girl. Trent
has taught me everything.
What?
- Rock with the song.
Are men invited?
That's that crazy woman behind us Sat
On the side, we are here on business.
The only things you have here is you do not.
What? You do not?
You do not fucking matter.
Wardrobe problems.
Let me explain.
- I trusted you.
Listen.
- Everything I told you ...
Security, he grabbed me.
He tried to rape me. He grabbed me.
He tried to rape me.
Call and ask for the FBI agent Croquet ...
... Say you're a friend of Big Momma ...
... And keep everyone in the room.
I do not understand.
- Go ahead, I put it out later.
Everybody sit on the chair.
- Mrs. Mercier, like dancers.
Apart.
What is this?
You really are a fruitcake.
Haley liked you better as a boy or a girl?
I have no time for.
- Come on, big boy.
You have 30 seconds to disappear
from the campus ...
... Or you can get more of this.
You have a thing to explain.
Chirkoff men have seen me yesterday
in the city have ...
Charmaine's disguise ... I once
turned off ...
... To Haley at close to continue.
You have your identity disclosed, and
lied about it to me.
For a girl you play?
- She played me.
Did she tell you that the box was?
You did your husband and one for when
you had me almost convinced ...
... But it's all fake because a real guy ...
... Would not venture his life for a girl.
It is not just a girl, you
did exactly the same with mum.
This seems to disagree on.
Come on, Malcolm.
- Get inside you.
You stay there. Do not go.
- You have to trust me.
Boss, we got it.
Go away. Leave me alone.
- Let me explain.
You have the music in that bag?
I want to discard and get out of here.
Since my life is ruined.
There are crazy and dangerous
people behind the box.
What are you talking about, it's
just a music box.
Not really.
This stick has evidence against
bad people ...
... So I worked undercover.
- What?
So this was a job?
Our night together and that kiss?
- There we talk about that later.
But right now I have this need.
There will be no later.
- Give me the stick only.
Trent?
- Haley, come on.
Go ahead.
That kid with the girl in the library.
Haley, we need a safe place.
Let me go.
- Come on.
Do not move.
You run good for a woman.
Do not shoot, I did not even
clean under a book ...
... The coroner will think that I ...
- Shut up.
My heartbeat.
My cholesterol. I come to you, Elizabeth.
Wait.
Come on.
This way.
Big Momma, catch.
Forward.
- It's okay, Haley.
Shut up.
Are you going to hurt
these innocent children?
Give me the stick.
- What if I say no?
I can deal with this gun, my
husband Arthur taught me that ...
... In case of a burglary.
Give him the gun, or I'll
shoot the kids down.
Stick.
Very good, Agent Turner. It took a
while before I realized ...
... Then I remembered again. You
were the man of disguises.
Do that carnavalspak out, then I
can check for weapons.
Shoot down the children, they know
not what they saw.
Kill them. This time I want no witnesses.
- My pleasure.
Trent ...
- I check the stick.
I'm sorry, it was wrong of me to
think that we could do ...
... This is my fault.
- No, you tried to protect me ...
... I've lied about everything. I'm sorry.
The family hour is over, soon
I am going to vomit.
Leave me some last words to say my boy.
I would like to take my grave with us ...
Cleveland Shuffle ... that together
could have done.
Remember?
- Yes, great dance.
If we do get a chance for it.
Twice to the right, two times to the left ...
Enough, no more mistakes.
I never leave a witness behind.
Wait.
My name is Kurtis Kool, which
is a fried moron.
FBI.
- Kool Kurtis.
You have saved my boy. Thanks.
Protect only the next generation of hip
-hop.
Haley, is it?
- Yes, I'm fine.
I knew it was the police.
He is not the police but the FBI.
You're a boy.
- Are you all right now?
Strange.
I know I've agreed to ...
... And after these last few days
is I have no regret ...
... You are adults now and I
must also respect your decisions.
The contract, signed, sealed and delivered.
This is what I do, study music ...
... The notorious BHD.
- Really?
There is no rush greatness ...
... You only get one chance a newcomer.
- Like a real man would say that.
Look at you at that.
I'm sure your dad just told me.
Is that so?
- Definitely.
Snapshot, weapons, you say things like that.
But Dad?
- Talk to me.
Can I keep the breasts?
- Put that bag in the car.
I deserve them, I've worn them so long.
If that's what you want. I was thinking ...
... Your mother does not know everything.
- Should I lie to Mom?
Some things you do not know.
You do not want a vein on
her forehead stands for nothing.
