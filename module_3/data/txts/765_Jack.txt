"I have been made to feel
so welcome here."
I have to bring Lakshmi home,
to put her ashes in the river.
Nine foreign students who get
shipped back to India wind up dead.
You visited Javed Nazeem
in a detention centre
and Martin Reed is tied up
with your father's foundation,
run by your husband.
What else am I gonna discover?
You can't do this! I've got paperwork!
Please, where are you taking my wife?!
Harry wanted you
to know that we worked out
where Ricky's gonna land his big sting.
- Which is his horse?
- Panda Panda.
What next? Climb up there?
No, no, I've got a security pass.
Brendan nicked it for me.
Got it.
Someone's broken in
and there's three of them!
Who in particular
have you pissed off lately?
She was right. Lakshmi.
It's like it's on fire.
It's gonna be OK.
No!
Gently!
This should have been done
three years ago.
Mm.
Cover her up.
For God's sake.

Ugh.
Don't tell me.
You were having Devonshire tea
with someone you don't know
- and they got shot.
- Yes, a woman!
Listen, Barry...
I was fucking joking!
Barry, I'm at a property about...
..about 10... out of Dargo.
This woman's shot herself. She...
Can you hear me?
Barry!
Listen, I'll call you from the township.
Stop now.
Make it stop.
Stop...
I need the names of everyone you've told.
I haven't told anybody.
Oh... Careful.
- You might sever an artery.
- Oh, Jesus!
I'll be back in a day or so,
see if any names have come to mind.
I wouldn't fall asleep.
You won't wake up.
Oh... Oh, shit.
Where do we find peace?
Is it in the embrace of a loved one...?
What are you doing out here?
I would have thought it was obvious.
Crucifying meat.
Why aren't you inside, with the others?
Someone has to man the barbecue.
There's a million dollars'
worth of prime rib here.
Oh, for God's sake, Phillip.
It's just today.
Can you not fuck this up
for my father today?
How many of them
do you reckon want it rare,
'cause I think it's all a bit late.
On Thursday, we launch Gloxinia
to every medical practitioner
across the country,
thus bringing to fruition
all the years of toil for all of us.
I'd like to get
our new CEO of Zarco, Phillip...
What's Phillip doing?
Phillip is, uh... turning
quality meat into carbon, it seems.
Now, Rory is going to hand
each of you one of these envelopes.
This is my thanks to you.
Shares in the company.
I want everyone here to share
in Gloxinia's financial success,
so you can all go and buy
your own bloody beach house.
To our supreme leader!
Bugger me, that was a long drive.
Barry!
You may want to...
make yourself comfortable.
I may be here for a while.
How... how did you find me?
Well, I just looked for
the most improbable place
that someone who has no idea
what the fuck they're doing
might end up in,
and, hey presto.
So, where's the corpse?
She's just over there.
Can you get me out of here?
Well, it's gone walkabout. Who was
it? Oh, hang on, there's more.
- Hang on.
- Kendra Raspovic.
She... she was a research scientist
with Martin Reed.
I didn't get to talk to her properly.
Ahh!
So, the man you didn't know
and the woman you didn't know
were working on something that I
assume you didn't know about either.
Am I gonna need a whiteboard for this?
There's... there's a... there's
a dugout in that hill, over there.
It's all in there.
Oh, can you cut me out?
Yeah.
Actually, I'm gonna...
need some tin snips or something.
Don't go anywhere.
Oh! Not funny, mate!
- It is a bit.
- Oh...
Oh, shit, they've cleaned it all up.
You think?
Well, there was all, um, chemical
formula stuff on the walls here.
And I... I found her computer.
She was... she recorded herself on it.
She was, um...
she was off her head, you know, so...
Yeah, on drugs.
So, what, two research scientists,
an underground lab, six shootings
and you didn't think to report that?
I was trying to sort it all out.
Yeah, well, excellent bloody job.
Our best guess,
Ricky Kirsch is gonna hit
the Harry Strang Stakes.
He wants payback on Harry.
Have I offended Jack in some manner?
No. He's probably just
been tied up or something.
He did know that Stella
was preparing dinner?
Mm.
Now, we think the horse he's backing
is a Queenslander, Panda Panda.
Whisper is it's very good
and Ricky'll back it to the hilt
if he can get the odds.
There are only two other
real contenders left in the race.
- Your horse, Terry.
- Kumquat.
- And yours, Cheryl.
- Yeah, Light Showers.
I have a horse in that race.
Yeah, um, We Can Win.
Trained her myself.
With great respect, Dougie,
your horse'd be more at home
in a milking shed.
So, our best guess is that he'll try
and nobble your two horses.
So, we double security.
No, no, we get rid of it altogether.
We want him to think he's got an open go.
Oh, I'm not risking my horse
on that psychopath.
Not asking you to.
We switch horses in the stables
the night before.
Put in some look-alikes.
We need a couple of useless nags
that look like your horses,
and that's where Dougie comes in.
- No offence.
- None taken.
I'll see what I can match.
And come race day,
we switch your horses back.
And what happens
if Panda Panda still wins?
Well, before the race,
we'll just whack it up
with a good dose of something
that we can protest at the end.
The only slight weakness is
if we have the wrong race
and the wrong horse.
In which case, we'll all be charged,
and banned for life from racing.
Has everybody got enough?
- Mm-hm.
- Yes, thank you.
- I'll have some more.
- Oh, OK, great.
For the life of me, I...
I never thought they'd deport her.
No.
Or that Stan would chase her
all the way back to China.
No.
Ah, for the want of a nail,
a kingdom was lost.
You know, I've been thinking, uh,
come Monday week, opening time,
where are we?
- Forgotten men.
- Yeah.
Well, since she's gone,
I find myself missing that kung pao
chicken thing that she used to make.
And I s'pose I...
I didn't mind her cong yu bing.
Gus?
Hello, Jack.
Linda.
Oh, good. You remember my name.
He was never very good with names.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm chatting to Gus.
Oh, what happened to your neck?
Oh... oh, it's just a shaving...
- He never gives a straight answer.
- Yes. You've noticed that?
Where have you been? You didn't call.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I...
Have you seen her drawings
for this cabinet?
Yeah. Just like her grandad.
I'll go measure up.
She a permanent fixture?
No... No.
You might need to tell her that.
Look, if you're here chasing more
details about the Indian students,
I've hit a bit of a dead end.
And I'd be careful, 'cause there's
somebody who's trying to shut us up.
That's precisely why
I flew nine hours to be here.
I just wanted to see you
and talk about dead people.
Well, I can give you everything
I've got, if that's...
Hello. Sorry. I should introduce
myself properly. Linda Hillier.
We were in a... relationship
for several patchy years.
I don't give a shit about any of that.
I told you that in India.
You always say stuff like that,
but you never mean it.
I want you to meet someone.
Uh, Jack, uh, this is Orton.
My... husband.
Hi, Jack.
Linda has told me a lot about you.
But I can see, by your face,
not a lot, you, about me.
No, not a great deal.
We got, uh, married... three days ago?
- Mm.
- In Manila.
Ha!
You came to the Prince
for your honeymoon?
Well, it was either here or the Bahamas.
Right. So, you're... actually married.
Well, we think so. We can't be 100% sure.
It was a very moving ceremony
involving a very drunk Filipino priest.
Actually, we're, um, trying
to adopt a little girl.
- Mm.
- And it's easier if you're married.
- So, ta-da!
- I wanted to marry her.
Why did you wear the shorts, then?
It... it was a solemn occasion.
Was she always this fussy about clothing?
I don't really remember. Why don't
I get some drinks to celebrate?
No, no, no. No, no, my shout.
I got the girl.
He's balding, you know?
Yep.
And he's shorter than me.
Yeah, he's not tall.
- And, yet, you married him.
- Yes.
We're planning on moving back here
once the adoption is sorted out,
and... I wanted us all to be friends.
You're very important to me,
and I think you'll like him.
Tell me, is it always the one
who does the dumping
that wants everyone to stay friends?
Almost exclusively.
And... for the record,
neither of us dumped the other.
You just let me drift away.
Ah, it's good to see
you two back together again.
We're not back together.
She's married this bloke.
- Orton?
- Yeah.
Much better choice!
I only met him 20 minutes ago
but I tell you,
if this place wasn't being sold up,
he'd be a strong contender
for Norm's stool.
Thanks, Eric.
Had you exercised due diligence,
you would have discovered
there was a sewerage pipe
running along that two centimetres
of disputed fenceline.
And that is why...
Bernadette, you asked me
to contest its location,
and I warned you at the time...
So, when the man moved the fence,
my house was flooded
with my neighbour's faeces!
- Oh, good.
- Are you even listening?
Gloxinia.
Hot drink, Dad? Keep you warm.
This, uh, relationship you're having
with this... Jack Irish...
It's nothing to do with you.
It better be over.
It's none of your business.
It certainly is my business.
He's trying to drag down
everything I've worked
the last 50 years to build up
and it cannot happen.
You better decide which side of
the fence you're sitting on, girl...
I have been nothing but supportive.
I know. That's why
I can't allow this to happen.
And I won't have you destroy
your mother's memory.
Oh!
How did you manage to conjure up Mum
into this conversation?
Why do think I've invested
every penny I own into this drug?
Why do you think I named it
after your mother's...?
Her favourite flower. I know, Dad.
We've been over and over and over this.
If you and your lover boy
want to cause trouble...
...I'm gonna hurt you.
I don't want to do it.
It's the last thing I want to do...
How dare you?!
I will leave everything, the company,
to Phillip and the boys.
All I'm asking is that you support me
in these last few months of my life.
It's up to you.
I don't suppose
it's ever occurred to you...
...that you're the reason
she killed herself?
I'm sorry to do this to you.
Eric's is about the safest place
I know. He hardly gets any visitors.
It's OK.
I know he's an old whinger,
but Wilbur said he'd also come by.
You shouldn't see that mad woman anymore.
She's too needy. She's like my mother.
What do you mean?
She took me out to a girly chat
and a milkshake,
pretending to be all friendly.
When did she do that?
Couple of days ago.
Not the day you were taken?
I lived with my mother for 16 years.
I know what mad people sound like.
You're not gonna do a runner
again, are you?
- No, I want to be here.
- Very funny.
- I do.
- Really?
Why?
Because they like me.
Yeah, well, so they bloody should.
Jack! What the hell are you doing here?
Did you have anything to do with
Gus being taken?
- Well, is she alright?
- Don't avoid the question.
You sent me that text message, right?
And I know that you met with her
a couple of hours
before she was kidnapped.
What would you two have to talk about?
- You.
- Bullshit.
Just come inside.
Phillip and the kids
will be here any second.
I had nothing to do with Gus being taken.
I spoke with her because it appears
she's your only connection
to anyone human.
And because I wanted to find out
if I was barking up the wrong tree.
Why?
Because...
...I am walking away
from a 12-year marriage.
I'm not asking you
to walk away from your marriage.
Right.
Have you told your husband?
I was going to.
- After the launch.
- After what launch?
Gloxinia.
What is that?
It's a new antidepressant,
and a very good one.
It's been drug-tested by the TGA
and by half a dozen other
international independent bodies.
Does this chemical formula
mean anything to you?
I'm not a scientist.
So, you don't know if it's anything
that Martin Reed or Kendra Raspovic
might have been working on
with the grant money
from your father's company?
My father is a bloody saint.
And he will do a thousand
more things in this world
than you will ever do.
Shit. They're home.
Use the back gate.
What's going on?
I cannot work in an environment
where everyone else
is happy to be miserable.
I am sorry, but I am, by nature,
a naturally happy person.
Listen, Kendra Raspovic,
before she died, she made these tapes
of herself on computer.
OK, they don't make tapes on computers.
Well, it doesn't matter.
The computer was stolen.
The thing is, on her walls,
she'd drawn these birds, right?
And when I saw Javed Nazeem
at the detention centre,
he'd sort of scrawled
this picture of the same bird,
flying up to the clouds,
and I'm wondering if she's
put something... on the clouds...
- Stored on the iCloud?
- Yeah.
'Cause she went to all this trouble,
so I'm assuming it's for someone
specific, whether it's...
Ohh... ..Javed or Martin Reed.
She posted on the cloud.
OK, great.
But it's encrypted. A 22-symbol password.
But if she wanted someone to find it,
why would she make it so complicated?
I mean, what's a 22-symbol password
that's not complicated?
Working with miserable people
drags you down.
I reckon that's gonna be
too many letters.
Well, you're on your own, then.
Kendra... Raspovich.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
You'd better have
a life-threatening illness, Jack.
Thanks, Harry. Isn't it past your
bedtime? It's almost six o'clock.
'Cause there needs to be
one heck of a reason
why you didn't make it to our briefing.
Well, I was knocked unconscious
and I was tied to a tree,
with a wire around my neck,
in the bush outside of Dargo,
and I was left to die.
Stella had made scotch eggs.
And we needed you to cast
a no-nonsense legal eye
over our plans for Caulfield tomorrow.
Yeah?
We may be charting
difficult legal terrain.
If we drug Ricky Kirsch's horse,
and fix the books
so that he loses a fortune,
are we roughly within
the framework of the law?
No.
No, that's pretty much
the definition of breaking the law.
But borderline, do you think,
given that he's scum and that we're
doing it for the sake of racing?
You would be so far outside of the law
that you would need your...
special binoculars to... see it.
Well, I'll take that,
uh, as unofficial advice.
Well, it's official.
Just think about
what it is you're doing, mate.
You worry about being there.
I mean, if you'd bothered
to come to the meeting
instead of sunbathing under a tree,
you would know
that we have a foolproof plan!
Dougie, Kumquat is a grey filly.
Light Showers has white patches
all over its hindquarter.
Now, in what universe did you even
think these horses resemble them?
Sorry, Cam. My mind's not on the job.
Been experiencing a few issues
on the home front.
That, what, cause colour blindness?
Now they look alike. Come on.
Gretel's sniping at me 24/7.
How I continually let her down,
how I don't clean after myself,
how I'm a disappointment in the sack.
But she's not flash in that capacity
either, Cam, I can tell you,
not with her knees.
Our 25th wedding anniversary,
I give her a 2,800-watt vacuum cleaner.
She takes one look at it
and walks out on me.
Here you go. This way. This way!
- I'd even gift-wrapped it!
- Shh-shh-shh!
- Should I shut my torch off?
- No, leave it on!
Right, come on. Right here.
You do Light Showers
and I'll do this one.
The thing has excellent suction.
Come on, Dougie.
And where is the vermin spit?
He should have shown up
in his high heels by now.
Well, maybe he couldn't
find a matching handbag.
Maybe he's not gonna show up.
Pity to waste all this criminal activity.
Oh, he'll show.
Panda Panda's odds are 10-to-1.
Ricky Kirsch could be looking for
something much better than that.
Where are you going?
What did you just do?
Underwrite them.
Razor'll up the ante
and the others will follow suit.
Yeah, but if Kirsch's horse wins,
you're gonna lose a fortune.
Then we lodge a protest.
They'll test her and find out
that Panda Panda's been doped.
We've thought of everything,
which you would know
if you'd attended the meeting.
- What if the protest isn't upheld?
- Cynthia's a steward.
And if the worst happens,
Dougie's agreed to take the fall.
So... so, Dougie's actually the one
doping the horse?
Dougie? No!
He's way too unreliable.
We got that mate of yours.
What mate?
Jack fuckin' Irish.
- Is it done?
- All sorted.
You got HIM to do it?
Had a little bit of white on it,
you said.
Yeah, well, you saw the photos.
On the legs.
- Not on its forehead?
- Oh, dear.
What number did it have?
- Number?
- Oh, God.
Harry, you'd better have a word to Razor.
He's got Panda Panda at 30-to-1.
Stop him! Jesus!
Oh, God! There's Ricky.
I should never have come back to racing.
I was happy, going to
gardening shows and... playing golf.
And they're
leading them out of the yard now
for the running of the fourth.
It's the inaugural Harry Strang Stakes.
- Tell me.
- He put 400K on it.
At 30-to-1, average,
you're gonna be up for...
Yeah, I can do arithmetic, Cam.
God, Stella's gonna kill me.
And the great
man himself is with us today.
I wonder if Harry's got any tips for us.
On ya, Harry!
- On ya, Harry!
- Harry!
I've bet on Panda Panda.
What about you, Harry?
I think I preferred you
in the ruby number, Ricky.
Ah, just a bit of fun, Harry.
Something you wouldn't know
anything about.
Not when you're around.
Well, just settle back
and enjoy the race, boys.
And they're set.
And racing in the 1,200-metre
Harry Strang Stakes
and Panda Panda began well.
Kumquat was into stride quickly
and Light Showers is up there
in the early stages.
Light Showers and Kumquat looked good
when we took them off the floats
this morning.
They were there last night.
They were in bed, tucked up, miles away.
Don't know which horses you drugged,
but it wasn't them.
Go, Panda!
- Go, Kumquat!
- Go, Kumquat!
Hit the thing!
Go, We Can Win!
We Can Win's come from nowhere!
Steaming down the outside.
I have a horse.
What a performance!
A horse that actually won!
Oh, yes!
Fill me up with helium
and fly me to the moon!
Ricky Kirsch?
Please follow this gentleman
back to the steward's room.
Police would like a word with you.
I'm smiling now, Ricky.
Light Shower's
dropped out in the straight
with Panda Panda.
And near the tail of the field...
So, what horse did you actually dope?
That one, probably.
What are you so happy about, anyway?
Neither horse won.
Well, I went down a few hundred.
But much better than millions.
And we finally buried Ricky Kirsch.
No, racing's the real winner here today.
Yeah, well, I didn't back racing.
I put 200 on horses
you said were a shoo-in.
Ha... Well, that's racing.
Stephane Grappelli's always seen
as the father of jazz violin,
but for me,
it's an Italian bloke, Joe Venuti.
She's not interested in dead
violinists, Wilbur! God, strike me!
Hey, I'm educating the girl
in the finer points of jazz, Eric!
Opa used to play
a lot of classical stuff.
Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, you know,
Charlie would have done, love.
Yeah... yeah, he would have done,
because, uh...
Well, you know,
he was a German, you know?
See? I mean, they lost the war,
so they used to listen to
a lot of miserable music, you know?
Whereas we won the war
and our music was, uh...
Hmm. Well, it was less grim.
Hey, he's half deaf, and the half
that isn't has got no musical taste.
Hello, mate. Jack, come in mate!
Sit yourself down.
Just in time to hear our Gracie.
Gracie Fields, love.
Well, we should probably
get going, actually.
I want to listen.

Don't worry, I've got another
version here by Jimmy Durante.
No, no, come on, come on, come on.
How many letters in
"The Bluebird of Happiness"?
22.
OK, so, I've done that, so how do
I know if I'm in this cloud thing?
Well, it says so.
Why? Do you think they're lying?
You were much more fun
in your pirate costume, you know?
OK, so, if I type in this password...
The... blue...
That's not it.
Mm-hm. Without intervals and no caps.
The bluebird of happiness.
Oh, bugger me.
Right.
My name is Kendra Raspovic.
Six years ago I was a research scientist,
working under Martin Reed
on a research fellowship,
funded by the Next Horizon Foundation,
in conjunction
with Zarco Pharmaceuticals.
What?
There's three and a half hours of this.
Can... uh, can I save this somehow?
Oh, right, OK. And then, how...
how do I watch it off that?
Mm. Yes.
You, uh, plug it into either nostril
and hold your breath for an hour.
Should work.
Oh, so, you can be funny
in your normal clothes.
Mm. OK. You are gonna download this
and then watch it on your telly.
- On the telly?
- Yeah. Plug it in the back.
Zarco paid a CRO, Delatech,
a fortune
to conduct illegal human trials.
Zarco then paid some fly-by-night college
to supply willing Indian students
here on temporary visas.
Now, you must believe me,
it was never anybody's intention
to hurt these students.
We started seeing side effects.
The drug was too powerful.
It caused unbearable pain
and swelling in the cerebellum,
bleeding and, ultimately, death.
We are responsible for the deaths
of at least 10 people,
and I can't live with that.
The truth must come out.
I have now taken the same drug
that killed them...
...and I will record the results un...
...until I am no longer physically able.
I would like to think my life
amounted to something worthwhile.
That guy.
Must be hard for you to move on.
Beautiful game.
I was born here, Linda.
Yeah, eight feet above
where you're sitting.
Yeah, that's how far I've travelled
in my life, a few steps.
- And the odd drive to Seymour.
- Oh.
I just never wanted to be anywhere else.
You didn't want to see the world?
Oh, no, no. I've seen enough on TV
to know to stick well clear of that.
You know, I met my Vera at the bar here,
and I proposed to her
on those very steps.
We had our reception
in the pool room there,
and she left to live with my cousin
through that door there.
There's just so many happy memories.
So, time for a change.
Well, you know,
I know some people thrive on change,
but... it just makes me nervous.
And when Cherry Blossom
came into my life,
I thought, "Good. I'm happy.
No more change until I die."
I mean, I don't even drive
to Seymour anymore.
- Oh, that's where my cousin lived.
- Oh, of course.
We've spent the last
40 years arguing about this,
and we still haven't come up
with a final list.
- Yes.
- Well, give me your candidates.
- God! Stan?
- What?
I'm gonna shout this man a beer.
Don't believe it.
My last days here, and Eric's
gonna shout someone a beer.
Hey, listen,
can I borrow your press pass?
Mm. Oh, hi, Jack. Um, great. Yourself?
I know who's behind it all.
Zarco Pharmaceuticals.
And they've got a big launch
and I'm gonna need
a press pass to get in.
Well, mine has my name
and my photo on it, so...
- Well, come with me.
- No, Jack.
I told you,
I've finished with all of that.
- Really?
- You're on your own.
OK, I'll find another way to get in.
Where do we find peace?
Is it in the embrace of a loved one,
the sticky hands of a toddler,
or is it dabbling our feet
in the cool, tranquil waters
of a mountain stream?
...and in the knowledge that says
we are in control...
It's going well.
...that our breath feels easy
and the rhythms of the world...
Let's just get through this, shall we?
What do you think I'm doing?
To love openly...
That peace of mind is now
just one step away.
Uh, yeah, Dr Benjamin Greaves.
You're already here.
Oh, I'm his guest.
There are no plus ones.
Except for me. Uh, Linda Hillier.
He's my photographer.
Idiot, forgot his press pass again.
Where's his camera?
Oh, uh, you'd be surprised what
papers are reduced to these days.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
Do they want publicity or not?
'Cause I'm happy to leave.
- Alright.
- Thank you.
..premier
arthritis treatment in the country,
now gives you Gloxinia...
Thanks.
...the serotonin reuptake inhibitor...
How the hell did you sneak in?
Linda!
Hello.
Nice to see you two back together again.
He's been an idiot without you.
I didn't think you came to these things.
I go to all of them.
Bowel, uterus, spleen, you name it.
Food's much better here
than anything I get at home.
Hey, um, just by the way,
over there's the kitchen.
I reckon the curry puffs'll be next.
Oh, that's the one
Gus was talking about? Typical.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the new CEO of Zarco, Phillip Quinn!
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Firstly, let me say,
I am not responsible
for this new wonder drug.
It was spearheaded by
my father-in-law, Thornton Finch,
in his long years
at the head of this company.
Jack, you're a bloody fool.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I just had something
that I needed you to see.
Unless, of course, you've seen it before.
...every other antidepressant
on the market.
We've studied 3,000 patients
with severe clinical depression,
refractive to the two
leading time-honoured
depression medications.
Yeah, copy that.
I can explain everything, but not here.
There are three profound reasons...
Here. Take this, will you?
...to recommend this medication
above all others.
Oh, excuse me,
I was wondering if you knew
when the curry puffs were coming out,
'cause Doctor Greaves said that
he that he thought they were next
and all we got were these gyozas.
- I don't...
- Take that.
- Excuse me, Miss.
- You're not gonna...?
Oh, uh, what about you?
Would you mind...?
..12 separate clinical trials,
with an overall disparity
between trials of less than 2%.
Oh, shit.
He came with a woman. Pick her up too.
Oh, Jack...
Excuse me, I need to get to
the champagne at all costs.
I'm sorry, Dr... Samabuta Mawanjama.
Yes. My father is part Zulu.
Um, can you...?
Righto, there she is.
Come with me.
No, I don't think I will. Unless
you want me to cause a giant scene.
That's up to you.
I tried to warn you.
That's Kendra's last words. It's
a complete record and confession.
You must think we are terrible people.
Yeah, I'm warming to that idea.
None of us knew
that the drug would do what it did,
but we are here today
because of those early trials.
- And you knew.
- She does now.
Does it matter how it got here?
This drug will improve
the lives of millions of people.
Yeah, well, I'm only interested in
10 Indian students.
Then you're a fool.
What is it?
I'll do it.
Oh, for Chrissake, Rory!
- I am truly sorry.
- Oh...
They'll trace you to this.
It's just your standard overdose
of scopolamine.
Devil's breath.
You'll slip into a coma and never return.
Let's see what he's got.
What the...?
- But...
- Ole!
OK, back to work.
Mr Finch, you'd better
take a look at this.
Zarco, Delatech, Thornton Finch,
Immigration.
They knew what they were doing.
They sent them all...
all back home, to die horribly.
Turn it off! Turn it off!
No, no, no.
Let it run.
Let it run.
Who are these men?
He never said where he was going?
- They've taken him.
- Yeah, well, they're denying that.
Of course they bloody do!
Have you spoken to her?
No, she's nowhere to be seen,
but she can't go far.
You said she and Jack were lovers.
You've seen the footage.
They're murderers.
They've killed at least 10 people,
and now Jack.
Hang on, hang on. We don't know
any of that yet, right?
And Jack has an extraordinary ability
of coming back from the dead.
I swear, it's like he was Jesus Christ
in an earlier life or something.
Look. Linda... Look.
I'm sorry, OK?
I'm worried too.
I've got men combing the state.
Plus, he can't be dead.
I couldn't be that lucky.
There you go.
I think we... should go and come back.
I can't leave her.
You go.
No, I'll stay with you.
We can sleep in Jack's bed.
I don't have too many lines in the sand,
but I think you've just found one.
I'll get some blankets.
Oh! So sorry. So sorry!
Ugh.
Reception.
Yeah, this is Jack Irish.
I'm just... just wondering
when I checked in here.
It's... it's... it's perfect.
Hmm!
Her grandfather was
the best cabinet-maker in Melbourne.
You're forgetting me.
Hi.
- Sorry.
- Here, let me do it for you.
What happened?
Uh, I have no idea.
Well, it's front page news.
Zarco, Delatech, Meritus Institute.
They're all in deep shit.
I've got an interview
with the Minister of Immigration.
Maybe when you get to Immigration,
you might do something for Stan.
Later. Just go to sleep.
Sadly, not with you.
No.
I found that... parcel of yours.
Why'd you never ask me if I got it?
Well...
I presumed you did,
but... you were just over me.
Things might have been very different.
Although, you know,
Orton would never have let it go.
He would have hounded me.
Still, nice to know there was a moment
you would have tripped over
that last hurdle.
All too late.
Well, you've got your own family now.
Oh, no, Gus is not staying. She...
So you keep saying.
- Well, I s'pose I should thank you.
- Hm.
I... used a sedative.
Switched the needles.
Well, I meant for the hotel room, but...
...yeah, thanks for not killing me.
Forgive me if I don't return the thanks.
They were just... good people,
trying to do something worthwhile, Jack.
Yeah, so was Eddie Chin,
and those students.
Phillip wanted me to give you something.
Lakshmi's ashes.
He said it was her body that finally
helped them get the drug right.
Whatever that means now.
Thanks.
Cherry!
- Cherry!
- Mmm!
- Oh, it's so good to see you.
- Look at you!
I missed you. Handsome!
Mmm!
Uh, who are all these people, my love?
My family. They all got visas.
They have come to live with us.
Oh!
Oh, that's... I'll get that. All of them?
- Yes!
- That's... Yeah, great.
Hey. Hey, hey, no.
No! You can't sit there, mate.
You... you...
Oh, gawd, struth!
Yeah, just straight through.
Oh, God.
This is all because you wanted pies.
God!
What?
It's... it's a perfectly good join.
You're just never happy.
