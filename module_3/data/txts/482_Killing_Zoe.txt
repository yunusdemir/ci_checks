Hotel mondial.
Le mondial. Tres bien.
Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un
moment. L'autoroute est ferme. A cause
du 14 juillet.
[Do you mind the radio?]
[Do you want me to turn the radio off?]
I don't speak french.
Ah. American?
That's right.
That's good because I speak a little english.
I asked if you mind the radio.
Music. You know.
Super cool.
What time is it?
Time, time, time. I don't know. Daytime.
Are you in town for business?
Yes.
It's a nice hotel. Your hotel.
Very big rooms.
Do you know paris?
I've been here once before.
When I was younger.
Those were the days.
Married?
I beg your pardon?
Do you have a wife?
No.
Why?
Well, if you need a wife for the night...
for business.
I give you my number.
Very nice girl. French.
Like when you were young.
You just tell me and I set it up.
What you laughing at?
You let moises set it up.
Your package... it arrived in the
last night of before last night.
The toilet.
From here you can operate the television.
Merci.
He starts to leave.
Oh, wait.
The bellboy turns around.
What time is it?
What time is it?
Time.
Ah. Yes. Il est presque huit heures
bonjour.
Bonjour.
Wow.
Vous avez une belle chambre. Je ne
ca sera 150 francs de I heure.
Toute la nuit pour 700.
D'avance. Et faudra porter un...
I... don't speak french.
It's okay.
It will be one thousand francs for all night.
In advance.
We can do it now if you want.
Well, let me just dry up.
Okay, but it's not necessary.
What's your name?
Zoe or zoey. Which ever you like.
My name's zed.
That's funny.
We both have z names.
What was that?
You can take those off. The pants.
I'd rather watch you get undressed first.
All right.
Slower.
All right
mister america. Zed.
Slow enough for you?
I'm cold.
Zed?
Yes?
Moises told me you were in
town for business.
Yes.
What kind of business?
Why?
I don't know. I'm just curious.
Do you ask all your clients questions?
No. Just the ones I like.
So you like me?
Yes.
Why?
I run into some real creeps.
You know.
How do you know
I'm a good person?
Body language.
We fit together.
All men and women fit together.
Hell, even some men fit together.
No, but you know, we clicked.
You made me orgasm.
Do you know how often I orgasm with a man
moises sets me up with?
No I don't.
Usually never.
They're almost always fat like pigs.
And you make me feel safe.
That's
something more
important than the orgasm.
An integral part
maybe of the orgasm.
I never really thought of it like that.
Well, its true. Zed nods at this.
Turn off the television.
So I mean it when I tell you zed,
I like you very much.
Well, I like you too zoe.
Honest?
Why? For the same reason?
Any man can orgasm. Even with his own hand.
Zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer.
Well, I like your honesty.
You're open.
Unlike most prostitutes
I've been with.
She doesn't like the sound of this.
She slaps him.
I am not a prostitute!
Zed is a little surprised at this.
Really?
Can I have my francs back then?
I'm a student.
And to pay for the
classes I became an escort.
It's my
choice to sleep with you.
I see.
What?
You don't understand.
No, I do.
Hey, it's not easy.
I didn't say it was.
I'm here because I want to.
Okay,
okay relax.
What school do you go to?
The centre du art, paris.
That's really interesting.
What kind of art do you study?
Not any of the old shit.
Oh.
I have a day job too.
Three times a week.
But someday there
will be only my art.
What kind of things do you paint?
I don't paint.
I make things. Objects.
Not like sculpture.
Like life... but with
what I do
I do only for the objects.
I d like to see one of these.
What? So you could see the
work of a whore?
Zoey. I'm sorry for calling you a prostitute.
I didn't understand the difference.
The difference is a prostitute would have
lied to you about her orgasm.
What time is it?
I have no idea. Night time.
I'm going to take a shower.
Eric. Come in.
They hug.
What happened to you?
I thought you were going to call.
Oh I see.
You have been busy.
Sorry, I asked the hotel to
give me a wake up call.
That's good, but now I am here.
So let's go. We have a lot to talk about.
What about the girl?
Is she your girlfriend?
No.
Fuck her. She's a dishrag whore.
Kick her out.
I'll let her stay here tonight.
don't be silly.
It's dangerous.
Eric.
don't worry about her.
God damn it!
So tell me, what have you
been up to?
Eric, I liked that girl.
Oh. Well, then why
didn't you stop me.
Because you were
on a rampage.
Look, your whole life you've
done nothing but fuck whores.
A girl like that will
give you aids.
Why don't you find a
nice girl in the suburbs?
Because when you need to get off
you don't want to have to date for months to do it.
Just use your hand like me.
Sometimes you just need
honesty... and security.
I don't understand.
Anyway, it's too late. Get dressed,
lets go out and meet the boys.
Okay, let me take a shower.
No, in paris it's good to
smell like you've been fucking.
It will make them respect you.
Just put on a shirt
and a sport coat.
I'm glad you came.
How long has it been?
11 years.
It's amazing, you know?
Here you are.
One day in america. Now here.
Well, to be honest there really wasn't
much happening for me in the states.
But in paris your old friend
eric has a job for you, so you came.
That's good.
How could
I resist your invitation?
You would have been stupid to.
So what have you been doing here?
After school I spent some time in
algeria studying african philosophy.
And then I bummed around.
You know. For fun.
For a while I worked at le figaro.
The newspaper.
Really?
Yes. With an assumed
masters degree.
And lately we have just been
bombing fascists here in paris.
You know, like terrorists.
Zed looks over at him.
Is that cat dead?
I don't know. I think it's a sleep
but it's been there for days.
I guess it is dead.
They walk into the flat.
Hello.
They all return the greeting.
Okay. This is francois,
ricardo, jean, oliver, and claude. Got it?
They all know who you are.
Beer?
Thanks.
don't think of it. Come. Sit down.
Easy. don't scare him.
He just wants to claim you.
Let me introduce you properly.
This is enrique. The monkey screeches.
He likes to be called chim chim,
but we don't always get what we like... do we?
Again, the hideous creature screeches.
Taistoi!
Do you like hash?
don't sit next to that junkie.
That little shit monkey of yours
pissed on my billy holiday albums.
Next time he's out the door.
Zed, come here.
don't ask me where we got this.
On bastille day, all the banks are closed.
He places his hand on the blueprint.
But this one. Bip.
The banque internationale de paris.
And for being greedy
capitalists perhaps they will remain
closed next bastille day. Yes?
We will go in and
shut the bank down.
Now, look at this.
As you can see,
only one person can start the alarm.
The concierge, at this desk.
We will take care of him.
Then we can close the bank.
No one will know the difference since
every other bank will be closed.
Are you sure
he won't push the alarm?
Ahhh!
He's right next to the door.
We'd have to be totally incompetent
not to stop him. don't worry about that.
Here. This is where they keep the days
reserve cash. Okay fuck that.
There are many vaults downstairs,
but this is the vault we must get into.
This is where the real prize is.
What kind of vault is that?
Ah... swiss made. A caliber.
Caliber?
It'll take three hours.
No, thats too long.
Thats how long itll take.
Well shit. It's too long.
We have to be in and out. Like that.
Or there will be suspicion.
A little time is okay...
but too long and...
well hold on a second.
What's this?
Another vault.
No this.
I don't know...
it connects the two vaults.
Well, what kind of
vault is this other one?
Also swiss,
but this one is a poseidon.
Why would those two
vaults be connected?
I don't know.
Because i can get into this
vault in half an hour. Maybe less.
But this entry way is too
small to get the platen out.
We have a lot of
merchandise in there.
No, don't you see?
We get in through
this secondary vault and take this passage
to the other main vault. From the inside
i could open the caliber vault in five minutes.
You could open
it in five minutes?
From the inside its easy.
Hot damn.
That is our answer.
Okay.
When is bastille day?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow!?
We're doing this tomorrow?
But of course.
It's impossible.
It's not impossible.
Everyone knows what to do.
I don't know what to do.
You don't need to know shit.
Just get into the vault and we'll do the rest.
I haven't even seen the bank.
Fuck the bank.
Before we do a job we live life.
It's better that way. Okay?
Okay.
Good. Now we do heroin!
Do you want heroin?
No. A little bit of heroin, some hash, a
beer... and you re just right.
Try some.
Its called chasing the dragon.
The chinese have been
doing it for centuries.
I don't think so.
Oh, but you must.
It will make you feel
as though the rest of
the world is in a bubble of glass
and that you're
rubbing up against it
like a bad windshield wiper.
Do you like french cars?
Yes.
I like the cadillac.
Fiftytwo to seventyfive.
Very nice.
Up here you can see
the eiffel tower.
Is tomorrow really
bastille day?
Yes, tomorrow we pull
the biggest job in french history.
And spend the rest
of our lives in
monte carlo.
[Faster, faster... go faster.
Let's beat them!]
Watch it! don't crash my car.
Over here is where the male prostitutes
sell themselves. Do you see?
Fucking fags!
Suce ma bite?!
This is good to have you here.
We could not do this without you.
Everyone has agreed to give you
double shares. That's good.
That's good.
You know i have aids.
From the needle.
Really?
Okay, up here is the
arc de triomphe.
So, how long
have you known eric?
Well, eric's mother is american.
Yeah, and his dad's french.
They're divorced.
And she and his father had some kind of
six month split plan set
up. So every six months he would come
back to the states. We were best friends.
Eventually he and his mother
had a falling out and he stayed here.
It's been... years.
Well, it's good to
have you here. Eric
speaks fairly highly of you.
Say, he
says you're a big fan
of viking films.
Well... i suppose.
I used to be, when i
was young.
Oh they're the best.
Helmets with horns on them. Shit.
Thats fucking genius.
How bout toy jazz?
You like it?
Yeah... i guess.
I love it. Its really good, you know?
Like real music. It has a heart and
culture all it's own. It's, like,
jazz for dwarves... or guys in leiderhosen.
Total purity of essence.
Yeah.
Hungry cannibals'd like it.
Hungry cannibals'd like it!
Here, you must drink
some of this wine,
non merci,
c'est de la merde.
La ferme.
C'est du bon vin.
The fucking english.
Look at him.
He's crazy.
Hey! How was i?
I didn't know you could play.
I can't. But it's easy.
You just slide the thing.
Do you like this place?
Yeah.
Good. This is the real paris.
Here in the cellar. Up there...
on the street, all just street trash.
You have pompidou center,
the eiffel tower... all that tourist shit.
La louvre.
Good god the fucking louvre.
All of that is for the guide buses.
Even the people,
parisians, they are shit.
No one in france likes them.
It's true.
It's ridiculous. Even for us we get this.
But down here... -
. away from everyone up there,
the tourists, the attractions, the fucking
postcards, people change.
They forget, because they can not see,
that they are in paris.
It could be anywhere.
That's right. Down here you have music,
good food
you have the wine.
Even the wine. Its better.
So what do you think?
What do you think of paris?
Well, if this is paris... then i like it.
Good! Lets dance.
No
come on.
don't be a sissy.
Just snort this with your nose.
What's going on?
Why don't you do some?
Should we be doing this
somewhere more private?
Fuck them.
They can get their own.
No, I mean,
is it safe to do it here?
What!?
From the police?
Doing heroin here is
safer than in amsterdam.
I don't know if i should.
But you must.
But if you want to
feel good then why not?
Go on.
You only live once.
Why do you talk to
street trash like that?
Whatever. Come on,
i want to talk to you.
Meaty pussy.
They walk against the wall.
Open your mouth.
Oh god. No more.
Shut up. You need it.
To see paris you need it.
What was that?
It's new. don't sweat it.
I wanted to
tell you zed,
there are others here in
paris, others that could
open that vault.
There are others in germany,
switzerland,
one in belgium...
all could do the job.
I don't need those assholes though.
I have you.
I have the one man
i can trust in the whole world.
My very good friend who
i look up to.
You are the one.
You are the one. Zed
lt's good to see you.
You know what
I'm saying?
What did you give me?
don't sweat it.
We all die.
The important thing is that in
life we experience everything.
You know what I mean?
No.
Tomorrow is the greatest day
of our lives.
The beginning of our lives.
The end of the complication.
Do you have fire?
Before, when we would make a bomb, you know,
to blow up a cafe or something,
it would cost us a weeks wage
working at le fucking figaro.
For me it was one week and
one half week.
Wake up.
Wake up sleepy head.
C'mon.
We have a bank to rob.
Would you like a croissant?
Perhaps some coffee?
I feel like i drank furniture
polish last night.
You did. It was probably the bad
spanish wine you drank. I told you not to.
Okay look, you should get ready.
The bank will be open for three hours today
and traffic will be hell.
My gear... i need it.
Oh, but we went by
your hotel last night.
don't you remember?
We have all your things here.
So get up and
take a shit so we can go.
So how is this going to work?
Simple. We go in.
We get what we want. We come out.
Once we get in we will wear these to
cover our faces. Just in case.
Will they have video cameras?
Oh yes. But we ve taken care
of that. So don't worry.
Everyone knows what to do,
so just do your job and we will all be fine.
So don't worry.
Be happy.
Your gun.
Thanks but no thanks.
You re welcome.
Just follow us. don't say anything.
It will go smooth.
Just like the old days, eh?
Except its no longer the minimart. Yes?
Eric no! I can open the vault!
Shut the fuck up!
don't you ever conflict with me
during work again! Do you hear!?
You didn't have to
shoot any of them!
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were
in charge now. Nobody told me.
If he had opened the vault it
would have saved us a fucking hour.
Eric. It's just that we've gone
from being thieves to murderers.
Oh fuck it doesn't matter!
Here you get the death penalty
just for robbing a federal bank.
I thought the death
penalty was abolished in 1980?
Ohhhh! That's what
they tell you! But who cares?
I need to take a piss.
Why don't you open the vault?
What is it?
What's going on?
I don't know.
Oh shit.
Who gives a damn if they see us or not anyway!
I can't see a fucking think in this!
This is insane!
I am a U.S. Citizen!
I'm just here exchanging dollars.
If it wasn't
for my country you'd all
be speaking German!
What's going on?
Nothing.
They were just scaring them.
Well, did you tell them
to stay quiet?
Yes. They're assholes.
Just having fun.
Its okay.
You can buy another one.
Cross your fingers.
Excellent.
What next?
We find the fuse box.
Its okay. I'll find it for you. No.
I need to see it myself.
Close behind him.
I think it would be better if
I looked for you. I could
hold on.
Here she is.
Okay, you throw this fuse switch off and
then back on when I call to you.
Any other switch
may set off the alarm.
Oh, I wouldn't want to do that.
Got it?
Got it.
Ready?!
Now!
It worked!
Oh my god it worked!
I can get through that lock in a minute.
Then do it. We don't have all day.
Dime store brand. Three minutes max. Good.
Fuck!
Another security guard?
Must be.
I think I stained my pants.
Me too.
What is it?!
I came down to see how
things were going and heard shots!
Some asshole in the vault.
We've got guns. Why don't we
just storm in and blast his fucking ass!
It's three against one! Let's give it the old
quiet!
I'm just trying to be helpful.
Just let me think.
You don't have to snap at me.
What is this guys problem?
What the hell are you doing?
Okay
that's too much.
Its dangerous.
I like danger.
You asshole!
You could have killed us all.
But I didn't!
Let's go check out the
damage.
Zed look!
I beat you!
I opened it in under three minutes.
Go around and wait
at the main vault door.
When I tell you, open it up.
Right. When you tell me,
I'll open it up.
I'll be at the other vault
waiting for you to call to me.
We're all rich!
Look at it!
I'm going to show the others.
We're rich!
We're not out of here yet.
Yes but We're rich!
Oliver, now!
Open the vault!
Do you want to give me a hand?
Do you think
we should get some cash also?
What for?
Money is too easily traceable.
You'd never be able to spend it.
And forget about exchanging it.
That's true.
Do we have a covering
of some kind?
A what?
You know. Something to cover this with.
It'll look kind of conspicuous leaving
the bank with a platten of gold.
Oh, it won't matter.
The police know what We're up too.
Police?!
You don't know?
But eric has them under control.
Zed is frantic.
No I didn't know!
How many police?
What the fuck are you doing!?
Do you really love your bitch
whore girlfriend that much?
She's really fucked
with your mind.
Eric... what are you
talking about?
Look at it.
Its all for us. The smoke.
The attention. They have no idea
of who they're dealing with.
They have no idea
what kind of men we are.
What kind of men are we?
You can no longer
be in our club.
You forfeit your
cut of the pie.
Zed laughs, there's not gonna be
much of a pie to eat.
What about our friendship?
Never let a girl
come between two men.
Zoe...
my zed.
They've hurt you.
You're going to be okay.
In many
through my cheek.
The police are now laying it on heavy.
Francois comes out of
the office.
Oliver! Let's get a hostage!
This is the end!
Listen to me.
We're going to lock
ourselves into one of the air tight
what about the others?
Listen... there's no gunfire.
The rear stairs to the lobby level.
You wanna fuck with me?
You wanna fuck with me?
I'll show you who you're fucking with!
He starts blasting away.
C'mon, we'll be safer in here.
What's your girlfriends name?
Zoe.
Zoe.
Zoey spits at him.
Zed no. I'll kill you.
It means nothing to me,
our friendship.
Eric... there's no fucking
way out of here!
Oh but you're wrong.
This is my way out.
This dime store couge
with her motor driven ass.
You find your own.
She tries to get away from
eric but he has a hold on her
shirt. Come zed...
I'm going to cut you like a sausage.
Did you see how she ran?
Did you see how
she ran? She doesn't care about you.
Fucking pussy only cares about pussy.
What do you say, zed?
I will kill you.
And once I kill you
what do you say to that zed?
Fucking bitch!
Ox! Where is thy yoke!?
Fuck both of you.
Au revoir.
I give you little kiss. Ciao.
The hospital?
No.
Come on.
I have a car.
I'm so tired.
We'll go to my flat.
You can rest there.
Do you feel pain?
No... it was mostly his blood.
I have a shower.
You can clean up there.
Thank you zoe.
He looks at her.
You'll get well. Then I'll show you
the real Paris. They drive away.
