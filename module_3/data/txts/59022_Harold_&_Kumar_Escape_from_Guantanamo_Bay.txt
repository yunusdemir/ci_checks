You don't see me freaking out.
Don't worry, man,

Oh, psyched? You think

Totes, dude. Why wouIdn't she be?
So how does this work?
We just--we show up in Amsterdam
and we start caIIing hoteIs...
and ask if they have
a Maria staying there?
- I don't even know her Iast name.
- Dude, it's totaIIy cooI.
We're definiteIy gonna find her.
Amsterdam is a very smaII pIace.
It's not gonna be--
Sir, I need you to step aside, pIease.
Let me search you.
- Did I beep?
- No, you didn't beep.
Just a random security check.
If you couId just step aside, pIease?
Just over here.
- Random, huh?
- Yeah.
So this has nothing to do
with my ethnicity?
Kumar, just do what the guy says.
Sir, it's our job as airport security...
to search for aII possibIe weapons
or iIIegaI drugs.
So just because of the coIor of my skin,
you assume that I have drugs on me?
- No, he's--
- What are you, a racist?
Racist? Dude, I'm bIack.
He's bIack. He's not a racist.
PIease, dude, you're bareIy even brown.
No, he didn't mean that.
Compared to me,
you Iook Iike Matthew Perry.
Hey, who you caIIing Matthew Perry, bitch?
I'm caIIing you Matthew Perry,
you Matthew Perry-Iooking bitch!
No, there's nobody here
who is Matthew Perry. No one!
What is going on here?
Sir, Matthew Perry over here thinks
that I have iIIegaI narcotics on me...
because I'm a minority.
This is textbook raciaI profiIing...
and I'd be more than happy
to caII the ACLU or the government--
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.
- You can move aIong.

Hey, what are you doing?
What do you mean, what am I doing?
He caIIed me Matthew Perry.
WeII, you Iook Iike Matthew Perry.

Why does everything have to become

'Cause this is America, dude...

Hey, hey.

I'm taking a piss, asshoIe!

What about the reaIIy high cIub?
- Are you retarded?

You brought weed
on the fucking airpIane?
- Yep.
- What the fuck?
Wait a second. You were giving
that security guard shit.
Yeah. How eIse was I
supposed to get past him?
By not bringing drugs on an airpIane?
- Look--What are you doing? What is this?
- You'II see.
HaroId Lee, I wouId Iike to introduce you
to an invention of mine.
Meet the smokeIess bong.
- You made this?
- You know, I did.
When you were sIaving away at work...
I was actuaIIy being
a productive member of society.
- Yeah, that's reaIIy productive.
- Let me show you how it works.
So you take a IittIe weed...
put it in the bowI right here and
Iight it just Iike a normaI bong, OK?
Now here's the truIy genius part.
Inside this mechanism, I have
actuaIIy made a IittIe tiny, tiny fan...
and some disinfectant powder, OK,
it works sort of Iike a deodorizer...
so that anything it expunges
smeIIs Iike LysoI.
- Put it away.
- No, dude.
Can you not wait
tiII we get to Amsterdam?
It's the weed capitaI of the worId!
- No.
- Put the bong away!
- Take the inauguraI hit, dude.
- No!
Come on, man.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Turb--
Terrorist!
RoIdy?
- What the fuck is that thing in his hands?
- No, ma'am, not a terrorist.
- He's just an idiot.
- This is just a bong.
He said he got a bomb!
No, peopIe,
it's a water pipe for tobacco.
No, no, no, it's not a bomb. It's just a bong.
Poison gas!
It's marijuana! Marijuana!
You picked the wrong pIane,
you terrorist fuck!
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?
There are three air marshaIs
on board. Three!
We are not terrorists!
Sir, that's a bong, not a bomb.
Shut up!
I got this one!
- RoIdy?
- PIease don't!
I am in a great amount of pain!
Everybody reIax. Just caIm down.
Everything is under controI.
TeII 'em to turn the pIane around. These
two asshoIes are goin' back to the U.S.
Secretary Fox. GIad you couId make it.
Think I'd miss a terrorist attack
of this magnitude?
Not a fuckin' chance.
Who are these peopIe?
Representatives
of the different inteIIigence agencies.
I assume
Secretary Whitmore's coming?
Negative. He's on an ice fishing trip
in GIacier Bay.
I'm in charge whiIe he's gone.
WeII, shouIdn't he be aIerted?
Isn't this issue of more importance
than an ice fishing trip?
Who are you again?
Dr. John Beecher,
Vice Chairman of the NSA.
Yeah, weII, Iisten, Dr...Dipshit.
You've obviousIy
never been ice fishing before.
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah, weII, it's fucking exhiIarating.
The Iast thing anyone wouId want
whiIe fishing for pike is to be interrupted.
Now back off...
and Iet me do my job.
What's up with the guy
with the weird eyes?
He handicapped or something?
We beIieve he's of Korean descent.
My God.
North Korea and aI-Qaeda
workin' together.
This is bigger than I thought.
You couIdn't wait?
You couIdn't fucking wait?
We were about to have
aII the IegaI weed we wanted.
You know, in Amsterdam,
where we were going!
Thought you couId
get away with this, huh?
You thought that after 9/11
our nationaI security was a joke, huh?
WeII...
guess what?
What?
We knew you fuckers wouId be back.
- HoIy shit!
- But we're Americans, man.
- We Iove America. We Iove America!
- Very much.
That's a convenient thing to say...
after you try and bIow up a pIane
fiIIed with Americans!
- No.
- No, we didn't do--
No, you see, you have the wrong idea.
My idiot friend here
brought marijuana...
- on the pIane.
- Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Zip it, HeIIo Kitty. OK? I know
your operation's funded through drugs.
No. This is typicaI
government buIIshit, sir. I--

Do we have the right

Yeah. Yeah!
I'm sorry. You want rights now.
You want freedoms right now.
Is it time? Is it freedom o'cIock?
- Guess what.

Where you guys are going,
they have never even heard of rights.
WeII, where are we going?
We're innocent men!
We're innocent men!
I'm an innocent man.
I donate bIood.
And toys for tots.
And now I'm in Guantanamo Bay.
See why I'm against paying taxes?
Hey! Hey.
Fuck you!
Dude, caIm down, OK?
Look on the bright side.
There's a sink. There's a toiIet.
The piIIow actuaIIy
Iooks pretty comfortabIe.
OK. You don't speak to me, ever.
- Ever.
- OK.
- No! Shut up!
- OK.
So what are you guys in here for?
For giving the United States
a taste of their own medicine.
- You guys are reaI terrorists?
- Some caII us terrorists.
Others caII us heroes.
Screw that. You think you guys
are heroes for kiIIing innocent peopIe?
It's 'cause of asshoIes Iike you
that we're even in this fucking pIace...
you fucking cowards!
WeII, maybe if the peopIe in your country
stopped eating donuts...
and started reaIizing what your
government is doing to the worId...
asshoIes Iike us wouIdn't exist.
- Fuck you! Donuts are awesome!
- They're deIicious.
You Iike donuts?

There's exposed vagina

Yeah. That was my idea.
I don't know about you guys,

ReaIIy? I aIways Iiked topIessness.
That's--

Listen. I'm reaIIy sorry
to bother you with this.
- You aII right?
- Not reaIIy.
They were Iocked up for Iess than
an hour, and they aIready escaped?
Damn it. Make sure the press
doesn't get wind of this.
Don't need the pubIic thinking
we're some two-bit operation.
Got it, sir.
It must have been either aI-Qaeda
or North Korea who broke 'em up.
Find out if they have
any reIatives in the country.
You probabIy shouId have
done that in the first pIace.
Do you have a probIem with the way
I'm running the show, Beecher?
I'm just saying that...
I've Iooked through the fiIes
on HaroId Lee and Kumar PateI.
They were both born
and raised in New Jersey.
Other than a coupIe of traffic tickets,
they're cIean.
Right. That's why
they just broke out of prison.
But they--It's not even cIear that they
shouId have been there in the first pIace.
Shut your--
You see this cute, IittIe white girI,
Beecher?
Yeah.
Do you want her to get raped
and murdered?
Of course not.
You sure? 'Cause this is America.
- Do you want to rape America?
- No.
Then stop fucking with me.
This is serious.
She's adorabIe.
So you guys are fucking fugitives?
It's just it's Kumar's fauIt.
If we get out of this...
the chances of us remaining friends
is highIy...
highIy--boobies. Yeah.
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
Put that back on. And keep it on.
- Sorry.
- Fuckin' party do you think this is?
Yo. What are you guys taIking about?
RoIdy was just Ietting me
in on your situation.
- Yeah?
- Thanks for getting me invoIved.
What about that fuckin' time
we had to cover for you...
Iie to your ex-girIfriend
about how you got crabs?
You owe us, man.
- Yeah, that's right.
- What?
- OK, that was a Iong time ago.
- I Iove crabs.
Speaking of ex-girIfriends...

or something?
How does everybody know about this
except for me?
Wait.
CoIton! CoIton Graham can heIp us out.
- No! Fuck that!
- Yes!
No doubt. If anyone couId
cIear your names, it's him.
No, I'm sorry.
That dickweed is not heIping us.
Wait a second.
Do you have his contact info?
Not anymore. But the wedding is
at his famiIy's estate in Hewitt, Texas.
But you don't want to bother them
when they're doing their whoIe...
wedding thing, right?
You know,
that actuaIIy might be our onIy hope.
Fuck! How do we get there? We can't
go to the airport. They're Iooking for us.

pIaying games at a time Iike this, man.
You reaIize what wouId happen
if our parents found out about this?
You have sent our sons
to Guantanamo Bay?
This is an outrage!
You Arabs think you can just mix in
with our peacefuI society...
and we're not gonna find you, huh?
I am not Arab! I am Indian!
Look, Chief. I'm not here to argue
sebIantics with you, OK?
I'm here to save Iives.
Ask the Lees what they know
about their son's terrorist activity.
Look, we have been American citizens
for over 40 years.
Now, frankIy, I find this very offensive.
They're using some sort of diaIect
I've never heard before.
But I'm pretty sure he said something
about going on the offensive.
TeII them we know
what their son is up to...
and if they don't cooperate,
he couId be sentenced to death.
Hit 'em. Yeah.
We know what he said!
Sir, HaroId and Kumar are good boys.
I'm a pretty good transIator.
It's totaI gibberish.
They may be trying to stonewaII us.
Are you sure you speak Korean, Jack?
You speak Korean?
You're not fucking with Daddy, are you?
Do you have a masters
in romantic Korean Iiterature?
Because I do...
and I'm offended.
Good enough for me.
Look, excuse me...
we're not Iooking to hurt your sons...
we just wanna know where they are.
Do you know if they know anybody
in FIorida?
Their friend Raza Syed Iives in Miami.
But why wouId they be there?
He's supposed to be in medicaI schooI.
They are supposed to be in prison!
That is where terrorists beIong!
These fuckers are goin' down.
Dead. Or aIive.
TeII them that in your fake
ching-chong Ianguage.
Shut up! You're an idiot.
I don't know what you're saying, buddy...
but fuck you.
- Fuck me?
- WiII you Iet him taIk to you Iike that?
- Listen, no, sit down.
- Fuck me?
Hey, Iook, man, we're in AIabama.
Wow, we actuaIIy get a first-hand Iook
at the South, huh?
Hey, this wasn't supposed to be a trip
through the South, OK?
This was supposed to be
the most romantic week of my Iife.
Remember that? Before you
fucked it up? You remember that?
Just chiII, OK?
We'II be out of this situation.
You'II be up in Maria's guts
in no time, aII right?
Hey. She's not some skank, man.

Excuse me, pIease.

What a fucking chode.
Thank you, come again!
- What the fuck?!
- Oh, my God.
You know, the whoIe reason
peopIe come to the stacks...
is for some peace and...
quiet.
Look, I know, I'm sorry. I hate it
when peopIe disturb me here too.
It's just this fucking caIcuIus finaI
is kiIIing me.
- Do you mind if I take a Iook?
- No.
- You're actuaIIy very cIose. May I?
- Yeah.
Excuse me.
I touched your breast.
- It's OK.
- Sorry.
You just go--
Wow. You're good at this.
Thanks.
What did you, Iike, take caIcuIus
in high schooI or something?
ActuaIIy, my dad taught it to me
in sixth grade.
What, are you Iike Doogie Howser?
No. AIthough that wouId be incredibIe.
He's my hero.
I Iove that show.
What are you working on there?
This is just a poem
for my creative writing cIass.
It's Iike--

- ''A poem of Iove by Kumar PateI.''
- I need this.
- Hey, Iet me read it.
- No, no.
- Why?
- Because it's Iame.
Then read it to me.
There's no way I'm Ietting you see me
in that Iight. Good Iuck with your caIcuIus.
Come on, don't be embarrassed. You
know, a Iot of girIs find inteIIigence sexy.
Look, I'm not even gonna be
showing this to my professor, aII right?
That's why I'm so stressed out
right now.
Stressed out, huh?
Come with me.
- ...going?
- Come on.
What?
You're smoking drugs in the Iibrary?
What if somebody catches us?
Don't worry. It'II heIp you reIax.
Oh, boy.
It's iIIegaI.
^ I want your fish right by me ^
^ That's how it has to be ^
Here.
^ --copacetic if you Iet it so set up ^
^ And keep the downstream down

This is poison.
^ My stoney, my baby ^
Let me heIp you.
^ Funk the groovin' thang whistIin' ^
^ As I rip my rhymes ^
^ Time and time again struttin'
and in the summertime ^
^ So screw it,

^ Strip down and be a passenger
Strip down and be a messenger ^
^ In askin' why I'm born

What's going on?

- What do you mean, why did I--
You were supposed to be foIIowing the

There's got to be Iike a highway

Yeah, there's got to be a highway.

- Nah, just go through, man.
Dude, we're not driving
through this basketbaII game.
You know, RoIdy, I reaIIy thought
you were bigger than this.
Dude, I'm not scared
'cause they're bIack.
I'm scared because they're scary.
And it's not Iike we got
Gregory Hines out there.
They're not that scary.
It's my baII!
Turn around.
^ Rob this motherfucker,

No. No. No.
They're coming over here.

- Yeah, I hit a fire hydrant on purpose.
They're getting weapons, man.
AII right, what do we do?
What do we do?
Run, run, run. Run, run.
Yo. Yo.
- Where y'aII going? Damn!
- We was just trying to heIp.
Man, somebody caII the poIice.
We need to report this.
- Yeah, that's right. You Iike the ride?
- Fuck you, man.
They abandoned it Iast night.
It's registered to a Raza Syed.
The witnesses' description
of the driver and passenger...
match that of Lee and PateI.
We tried bringing in Syed Iast night,
but he's aIready Ieft the country.
WeII, they know we're cIosing in on 'em,
that's why.
OK. No, I'II give you a caII. AII right.
No, no, no, no!
- HoIy shit!
- Easy, easy!
- Easy.

This is our witness.
Put it down! Yo, put it down!
You aII know I got one!
I got one too!
So, you saw the fugitives, huh?
Yeah. It was Iike
I was teIIing the Sheriff--
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
How do I know you're teIIing the truth?
I don't have a reason
to Iie to you, man.
ReaIIy?
- Get up in your face, man.
- We'II see.
That ain't right.
Where's he going?
What's going on?
HeII no!
Now why don't you teII me
what reaIIy happened?
Is that grape soda?
What the fuck, yo?
- AII right.
- HoId on, hoId on, hoId on!
This is so ignorant.
- ReaIIy?
- Yes.
Is this ignorant?
Yo, that's racist, man. That's racist.
Hey, Jon, are you gonna Iet him do that?
See if he got KooI-Aid.
AImost gone, witness.
Sure there's not something
you wanna teII me?
I'm not stoppin' untiI you crack!
I aIready toId you

AII right, aII right, aII right.
This isn't necessary!
Mr. White is teIIing you the truth!
Yeah, and how can you be
so sure, Beecher?
'Cause he doesn't have a poIice record.
He's an orthodontist, for Christ's sake.
OK, then, Beech. How do you
propose we find the terrorists, huh?
There was a Nokia 77 10
taken from the consoIe.
We have its tracking numbers.
Our sateIIites are running a trace on it,
as we speak.
I'm serious about that KooI-Aid.
What's going on? Where are you?
Dude, that is a fucking Iong story.
We're actuaIIy in AIabama right now,
heading to Texas.
What is that sound? Are you jerking off
again? What are you doing?
I'm taking a gIorious pee-pee.
Hey, Iisten, you're not gonna beIieve this...
but the other night,
I ended up at that Asian party...
and I schtupped Cindy Kim.
Shut the fuck up. Are you serious?
Yeah, man,
she even gave me a bIumpkin.
What is a bIumpkin?
It's when a girI gives you head whiIe
you're sitting on the toiIet takin' a shit.
ReaIIy?
- HeIIo?
- Hey. Hey! What are you doing?
HeIIo? Come, come?
Did you go?
Yeah, I'm done.
You said to me we were gonna
cross swords. You promised.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Are you taIking on a ceIIphone
when the government is Iooking for us?
Dude, it was just GoIdstein.
I had something important to teII him.
It's 'cause you had something--
That's good, that's OK.
Nothing is more important
than finding a way to get to Texas.
- Do you get it?
- Yes.
We've been waIking an entire day
and we have not seen a street sign.
Do you get it?
- Can I say--
- Again. This is--I can't.
Dude, honestIy...
you've got to be a IittIe more positive
about these things, aII right?
- Yeah?
- Positive about what? I don't--
First of aII, Iook at this beautifuI
AIabama Iandscape, OK?
You don't get shit Iike this in New Jersey.
God, you--
Hey, Iook, dude.

Sorry about that. I was in my zone.
What the heII are y'aII doing out here

We were on our way to Texas
and we got Iost.

You're a Iong way from Texas.
No!
Born in '04.
Get in here.
Yeah. The sun's about to go down.
- Y'aII need a pIace to stay? Ya hungry?
- Yeah, sure.
You want to foIIow me?
Come on.
Maybe we shouIdn't.
It's aIready dead.
You need a hand, dude?
My grandpappy

Very nice, sir.
This pIace is gonna suck.
Honey, I'm home.

- You just make yourseIves at home.
- Thank you.
Honey, something's wrong

Every time I go on the onIine,
it says, ''Searching for server.''
You try unpIugging the AirPort base?
Yeah, I done did that but it didn't work.
What you need to go onIine fors,
anyways?
I was gonna get one of them
new portabIe sateIIite radios.
What the fuck

Don't you be cussin'
when we got company over.
- Guys.
- PIease don't worry about us.
We cuss aII the time.
Who do you think you is, hitting me?
Who do you think bought you
that Prada bag?
I toId you I wanted a Gucci one.
The Gucci bag cost more!
WeII, Jan Sapperstein's husband
sure couId afford it.
Here we go again with Jan Sapperstein.
I don't give a rat's ass what that bitch got.
You be happy with what you have.
What I have is a husband
who ain't worth a turd!
You wanna give me shit now?
- That's right!
- After everything I Iet you buy!
Even Iook at the credit card biIIs?
...you buy?! Do you think we need
another set of goIf baIIs?
- Even worse is the credit card miIes.
- Stinky, smeIIy, motherf--
Guys, we're just gonna get out of here.
Nonsense. Don't be siIIy.
You're our guests.
You guys have got to stay for supper.
- No, we couIdn't. That's--
- No, thank you. We reaIIy couIdn't--
Of course, we're gonna
have to get high first.
We're cIose.
This is news to me.
I never knew farmers smoked weed.
You ever tried farmin' not high?
It's borin' as shit.
You know, this is great, guys.
I kind of aIways,
you know, sort of assumed...
that peopIe from the South
were kinda--
A bunch of dumb rednecks?
- No.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not--
We do try to keep our inbred son in
the basement when we have company.
Guys, I didn't mean it Iike that. I was just--
Look at their faces!
Fuck, fuck!
Shit, they found us.
They found us. They found us.
- What do you mean, they found you?
- Listen, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.
Are you boys in some kind of troubIe?
AII right. This is gonna sound crazy,
but, basicaIIy...
we were on a pIane to Amsterdam...
and we got mistaken for terrorists
and we got sent to Guantanamo Bay...
and then we escaped and snuck
into America with a bunch of Cubans...
and now we're trying to get to Texas...
where there's a guy
who can heIp us out...
and he's getting married
to Kumar's ex-girIfriend.
Yes.
OK. That's cooI.
- I understand that.
- You do?
Like the government's never screwed
us over before. You know what?
Y'aII come down here and hide
in the basement. I wiII handIe this.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, both.
Thank you, thank you.
OK. This isn't creepy.
What the heII is that?
You're waIking
towards the creepy music?
Ge--
This song rocks, dude.
Kumar.
Hey, dude, there's a Iighter here
with a cIown on it.
Jesus Christ, there's a fucking monster!
God!
Hey, you don't happen to have
a Baby Ruth on you, do you?
No. Why do you need a Baby Ruth?
That's how Chunk won over SIoth
in <i>The Goonie</i>s.
This thing Iooks Iike SIoth?
AII I saw was the creature's hand.
The hand Iooks Iike SIoth?
The fucking hand of an eviI monster,
dude. Like fucking cIaws and shit.
Shit.
Listen, no matter what, don't Iet
the creature know that it's ugIy, OK?
The Iast thing that we want to do
is criticize it or make it feeI different...
just because it was born
with horribIe deformities.
Don't worry. I got rid of 'em.
It was just my neighbors.
- There's a fricking CycIops--
- No, you got--
- ...in your basement, man!
- ...a fucking thing, dude!
You met Cyrus.
- Cyrus.
- You named it?
Our son.
You must have woke him up. He was
supposed to be asIeep. I'm sorry.
I thought you were joking...
when you said you had an inbred son
who Iives in your basement.
WeII, it ain't a joke.
RayIene and I here are sibIings,
and we get it on.
But that don't mean
we ought to be judged.
You boys must be awfuI tired
after what you've been through.
Come with me,
I'II show you to your bed.
You better go back to sIeep, boy!
Don't make me come down there
and whip your CycIops ass!
It's tough Iove.
It's the best way.
I don't know what I was thinking
dating that douchebag CoIton.
He is a douchebag.
What were you thinking?
But it was agony pretending
his puny, IittIe penis satisfied me.
I bet. I bet you've been missing
the thundercock too, haven't you, baby?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Yeah, you've been missing it?
How much?
- A Iot.
- I bet.
WeII...
- I kind of have this fantasy.
- What is it?
I thought it'd be kinda cooI
to bring somebody eIse in bed with us.
Who?
Hey, baby.
- Yeah!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- She's hot, right?
Let's do it.
- ^ There's something ^
- ^ About that woman ^
^ She's got something
you can't Iive without ^
^ Makes your heart sing ^
Faster, Weedy.
^ Something about that woman ^
^ If you're in doubt
then you are missing out ^
^ On a good thing ^
^ I got to give it up ^
Teeth, teeth, Weedy, teeth.
- Weedy!
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
- You Iike that?
Putting it in the ass now, Weedy.
Yeah, how about that?
^ Something about that woman ^
^ She's got something
you can't Iive without ^
^ Makes your heart sing ^
^ It's just something about that woman ^
^ If you're in doubt
then you are missing out ^
^ On a good thing ^
^ I got to give it up ^
Wow.
Dude.
I just had the most
fucked-up nightmare.
Come on, man.
I was having a reaIIy hot dream.
Go back to bed, pIease, dude.
Why did we have to Ieave?
Their <i>Goonie</i>s chiId was kind of cute.
I don't care. It tried to fucking bite me.
Jesus, every time the two of us
try to get anywhere...
it's fucking disaster
after fucking disaster.
Jesus, dude.
Here, you reaIIy need a hit of this.
Dude, I don't want a fucking hit!
It's your soIution to everything,
you know that?
Think about it.
We shouId be at CoIton's aIready.
Hey, chiII, we stiII have two days
to fuck up the wedding.
- What?
- What?
- What?
- What?
That's what this is aII about, isn't it?
You want to fuck up the wedding.
It's not fucking funny, Kumar.
It's not fucking funny!
CoIton is the onIy guy
that can heIp us out at this point.
I can't beIieve--I cannot beIieve
you're wiIIing to fuck that up!
I just hate that fucking asshoIe, OK?
Yeah? I Iike him better
than I Iike you right now.
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.
You know what he got me? A job.
You know what you got me?
Thrown into Guantanamo Bay.
- Your job sucks.
- Admit it.
You're jeaIous because Vanessa
found somebody better than you.
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?
Better than you! Let me think.
PotentiaI future president,
or unempIoyed pothead?
Tough. That's tough.
That's a tough one for her, isn't it?
Yeah, weII at Ieast
Vanessa's not in Amsterdam...
getting pIowed
by a bunch of European dudes.
- What?
- Do you reaIIy think Maria's...
saving herseIf for you, dude?
Right now, she's probabIy got
two uncircumcised dicks...
dangIing in front of her throat.
You know what she's gonna do with them?
Down 'em into her tonsiIs?
Fucking dick.
- That's my hat.
- That was my hat, bro.
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria.
AsshoIe!
Don't you dare say a fucking word
about my angeI!
What the fuck was that?
Get up. Get up!
Fuck you.
Shit.
Isn't that a KKK bonfire?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think it is.
Maybe we shouId
get the fuck out of here.
Yeah. Yeah, dude.
Let's do that.
The other day, caught a rerun
of that show <i>Becker</i>.
You know that show?
Yeah, that's the one

That bIond negro they got on there,
he had me in stitches.
He's actuaIIy pretty funny.
ReaIIy? You think so?

It's about seven doIIars?
Look, don't insuIt us, aII right?
I don't know
what the heII is going on here...
but I'm pIeading the Fifth
untiI I speak to my Iawyer.
You're pIeading the Fifth, huh?
Beecher, give me a copy
of the BiII of Rights.
The BiII of Rights? Why?
Just do it!
Excuse me.
Five, right?
- Five aIive.
- Sure.
OK. OK. Good.
You wanna know what I think
about the Fifth Amendment?
There it is.
That's what I think
of the Fifth Amendment.
Why the heII is your ass so dirty?
Don't you wipe?
Don't ask questions
you don't want the answer to, buddy.
What do ya got?
Turns out the FBI was aIready
tapping Mr. GoIdstein's phone.
- We got what we need.
- Wait a second.
You were tapping my phone?
You want to hear the tape?
No. I'm sick of Iistening
to this dirt farmer. What's the upshot?
Lee and PateI are on their way
to Texas as we speak.
I knew they'd trip up.
Ready the pIane.
These fuckers are goin' down.
NeiI, can you just focus on driving?
You've had--Focus on the road.
You've had dozens of shrooms,
my friend.
Dude, I was abIe to perform
an appendectomy at age 14.
I think I can handIe
a coupIe mushrooms.
- Wasn't that just a TV show?
- Jesus Christ!
Did you see that unicorn?
Its horn was so shiny.
So, why are you guys headed to Texas?
Let's just say
my ex-girIfriend's getting married.
The one that got away, huh?
Yep.
Sounds to me Iike you need a drink.
Road. NeiI, pIease,
can you pay attention--
Dude, I've got it!
- Yeah, but--
- He's a good driver. Stop.
Thanks, man. Cheers, dude.
ReaIIy? Drinking?
I have a Iost-Iove story of my own.
Yeah?
Happened on the set of <i>C</i>/a<i>r</i>a<i>'</i>s <i>He</i>a<i>rt</i>.
Sure, sure, yeah.
I'II never forget her.
Her name was Tashonda.
She was Whoopi GoIdberg's stand-in.
Her skin was so soft,
her Iips were so sweet.
She had these tiny,
IittIe Hershey Kiss nippIes...
that you just wanted
to suck on aII night Iong.
Anyway, Iast day of shooting, I toId her.
I said...
''T-Bird, we're gonna have to break up.''
Why did you do that?
I didn't think I couId take on
that kind of responsibiIity.
It was such a big mistake.
Why? I mean, with T-Bird gone...
couIdn't you have sex
with whoever you wanted?
Let me be cIear.
There is nothing on the pIanet...
that I Iove more than a hot, new pussy.
- Sure.
- Nothing.
What does the P.H. stands for in N.P.H.?
Patrick Harris.
No, common mistake. Poon handIer.
The point is, boys...
even though I Iove havin' sex
with some hot, random trim...
a day hasn't gone by
where I haven't thought of Tashonda.
Every time I see a bag of
Hershey's Kisses, my baIIs get so wet.
Here's to you, Tashonda.
- I hope you kept the baby.
- Wow.
^ Free on my own ^
^ That's the way I used to be ^
^ But since I met you, baby ^
Hey, honey.
What's up?
I found something in your purse.
Why wouId you go through my purse?
Why wouId you have a joint...
when you know
it couId ruin my poIiticaI career?
I'm sorry.
What with aII the wedding pIans,
I've just been a IittIe stressed.
It heIps me reIax?
Marijuana is iIIegaI, Vanessa.
Now, I thought that part of your Iife
was in the past.
- It is.
- Good.
That's aII I need to hear.
Hey, baby.
Look, I know things can be hectic
with the wedding.
But, you know, if you get stressed out,
just do what I do.
Snort ZoIoft, OK?
What the fuck?
Shit.
Dude, they set up a fucking roadbIock!
They're gonna find us.
- What are you taIking about?
- NeiI...
I don't know how to say this
any other way, man, but we're fugitives.
CooI.
OK, weII, we've got to find a way
to get out of this.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- PIease.
You act Iike I've never smuggIed
a fugitive across state Iines before.
Here. Hide in that.
Sorry. It's a IittIe sticky.
Shit.
Yeah.
What the--When were you
gonna show me these?
Excuse me.
Wait, Officer!
- Shit.
- HoId that car!
NeiI Patrick Harris.
Yo.
It is an honor to meet you, sir.
Yeah. I wouId imagine so.
I'm sure you get this aII the time...
but your part in S<i>t</i>a<i>r</i>s<i>hip Trooper</i>s
truIy, truIy changed my Iife.
ReaIIy?
How?
WeII, no one thought the war against
the arachnids of KIendathu couId be won.
- But you showed the starship troopers--
- NeiI!
...that those bugs couId be destroyed.
A Iot of peopIe think the war on terror
is a war that can't be won, right?
That's why I joined
the Department of HomeIand Security.
My friend, two words.
S<i>t</i>a<i>r</i>s<i>hip</i> fuckin' <i>Trooper</i>s.
If you want to know the secret of being,
you wiII come with us.
PIease. I reaIIy need to go.
Yeah, of course. I'm so sorry
to bother you. You move aIong.
Bye.
I Iove you.
I Iove you too, Mr. Patrick Harris.
What the--
HoIy fucking shit, that was awesome.
Try having that conversation
on shrooms.
I deserve an Oscar
for that performance.
- You do!
- Dudes...
I'm gonna take a IittIe detour
on the way, aII right?
- No.
- NeiI, no.
But we're aImost there, man.
- No buts. No buts!
- What do you do--
I'm going to a whorehouse
and I'm gonna get my fuck on.
If you two don't want to get
your dicks wet, that's fine with me.
I'II get my dick wet.
^ Don't need nothin' but a good time ^
^ How can I resist? ^
^ Ain't Iookin' for nothin'
but a good time ^
^ And it don't get better than this ^
Pussy, I'm home!
HeIIo?
WeII, weII, weII. I thought you'd never
show your face around here again.
What's the matter, SaIIy? I thought
I was one of your top customers.
Have you forgotten what happened
the Iast time you were here?
Because of you, my best girI quit.
Hey, I paid her good money.
It's not my fauIt
she didn't Iube up.
Besides, I bring you new customers.
- New customers?
- No, NeiI, that's aII.
Thank you. Thank you.
Appreciate it. Appreciate it.
SaIIy. Bring on the Iineup.
Line up in the chutes, girIs.
Longhorns coming through.
NeiI.
Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger.
HeIIo, ba--
- What's your name, miss?
- Tits Hemingway.
How'd you come up with that?
WeII, I have huge tits.
And my favorite book
is <i>A Mo</i>v<i>e</i>a<i>b</i>/<i>e Fe</i>as<i>t</i>.
I guess that makes sense, yeah.
WeII, I hope you're ready for me, Tits...
'cause I'm gonna rock out
with my cock out...
and you're gonna jam out
with your cIam out.
It's gonna be magicaI.
- The whores are on me, feIIas.
- No, NeiI...
- thank you, but we--that's--
- Thanks, dude.
Screw that, RoIdy.
I don't know about you...
but, no offense to the rest of you Iadies,
I am gonna be taking you two.
No, Kumar. Kumar!
RoIdy, you're missing out, brother.
Yo, we need to get back on the road,
buddy.
We need--
WeII, now, you know, we aIso suppIy...
in-room fiIms or a magazine.
WeII, if you'd Iike
some seIf-satisfaction...
we do have some...
eIectronic devices right over there.
Just have some coffee. Yeah?
Why don't you Iie on the bed?
And teII us what you want us to do.
OK. OK.
WeII...
how about--
How about you take off your cIothes
and make out with each other?
- We've done that before.
- We can do that.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

Great. Now Iet's get those pants off.
OK.
- You are benevoIent human beings.
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah?
- We get that a Iot.
Yeah. You know what that means,
benevoIent?
Yeah, I do, actuaIIy.
What?
It means we're gonna fuck you so hard...
your dick's gonna be sore for two weeks.
That is exactIy, exactIy what it means.
You know what bothers me
the most, though?
He never once apoIogized
for getting me into aII this troubIe.
I mean, I'm supposed to be with my
Maria right now in Amsterdam, OK?
But it's cooI.
He doesn't know how to say ''I'm sorry.''
Why do you think that is?
SparkIe, because it's aII about
what he wants. It's about him, him, him.
You know. I don't even care
because--You know--
if he can't be a good friend to me,
I'm not gonna be a good friend to him.
- It's done.
- Don't say that.
A good friend is hard to come by.
Venus, come on.
Yeah, but if he was a reaI friend,
he wouId know how to say, ''I'm sorry.''
That's right.
Thank you, Agnes.
NaiI on the head.
It's Iike right now...
after aII the shit that we have
been through in the Iast few days...
you know, he's in there having
the time of his Iife, having sex.
I never shouId have Ieft her.
I don't even know--
I don't even know what I was thinking.
I Ioved her so much.
She was my IittIe baby.
She was my IittIe baby.
Why did I Iet my IittIe baby go?
Why did I Iet her go?
You'II find someone eIse.
No, I won't. Not Iike Vanessa.
You'II find Iove again someday.
Yeah, you wiII.
Did you guys?
No, we're whores.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God. Are you OK?
What the heII is going on here?
That prick fucking branded me!
- Stop it.
- I warned you, NeiI.
Bring it.
- NeiI! NeiI!
- Time to put your dick in the dirt.
- What--NeiI! What are you doing?
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- But--
- No, NeiI.
NeiI!
- What about NeiI, man?
- No, fuck NeiI. He just fucked us.

Stop! Stop!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
We've got to get NeiI.

What was that?
- Hurry up.
- NeiI!
- Hurry up. Come on, man.
- Guys.
- AII right. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
- NeiI, NeiI, come on! Come on, man!
- Guys!
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
It's not even funny.
Hurry up, dude, hurry up.
You can make it, dude.
Oh, my God! HoIy shit!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Jesus Christ!
- NeiI's dead! NeiI's dead!
- No!
- Oh, my God!
- Get the fuck out of here! Go! Go!
^ How do I say goodbye ^
It's the dawn of a new day.
And NeiI Patrick Harris
isn't around to see it, man.
Dude, I toId you.
WiII you pIease stop saying that?
God.
He's gone.
Maybe he's got
some famiIy contact info in here.
Dude, I know
I'm not caIIing NeiI's parents.
What's in the bag?
- HoIy fuck.
- Creepy mask.
A jar with hair in it.
And, Iike, 1 2 cans of Mace.
- Look, dude.
- HoIy shit.
HoIy shit, we actuaIIy made it.
This is where CoIton grew up, huh?
SmeII that? That smeIIs Iike douche.
No, you wiII remain in this car.
I wiII go inside aIone and, if we're Iucky,
CoIton wiII heIp us out.
- Why can't I just--
- No. Let me put it another way.
You Ieave this car,
and our friendship is over.
- But, RoIdy, I just--
- Kumar.
Open the door
and I wiII cut your fucking baIIs off.
Jesus. OK.
- BaIIs.
- Go.
Hi, I'm a friend of CoIton's.
Thank you.
God damn it.
Vanessa? You OK?
- Kumar? What are you doing here?
- Yeah, Iet me heIp you up.
I thought you were going to Amsterdam.
Yeah, me too. It didn't work out.
You aII right?
- Now, does this hurt when I touch it?
- Yeah.
- It does?
- Yeah.
This is just what I need.
A Iimp during the wedding.
Can you move it around in a circIe?
OK, that's what I figured. It's just your
ATFL. I don't think you tore it, though.
So a IittIe ice and massage
shouId do the trick. You'II be fine.
Are you gonna teII me why you're here?
RoIdy and I ran into some troubIe...
and we figured that maybe
your CoIton couId heIp us out.
- StiII getting into troubIe, huh?
- A IittIe bit.
You remember that time that
you broke into the animaI Iab...
and, Iike, stoIe that monkey and put it
in Andy Rosenberg's dorm room?
OK, first of aII,
that was GoIdstein's idea...
and second of aII...
had I known that the monkey had AIDS,
I never wouId have done that.
What about you?
You put those disgusting used tampons
in Professor Konop's purse.
- Remember that?
- Come on.
She was a bitch and you know it.
What's going on here?
Hey, she actuaIIy feII
and broke her heeI here.
Yeah, I twisted my ankIe.
Kumar was just Iooking at it.
- Why aren't you in the car, Kumar?
- Dude, I heard her yeII.
I thought I toId you
to stay in the car, man.
It's OK, man.
No worries.
Listen, RoIdy fiIIed me in
on the situation.
But don't worry. I'II make sure
my dad takes care of everything.
Thanks, man.
In the meantime,
you are going to the doctor.

You shouId be home in no time.
Sweet.
Hey, CoIton, I can't beIieve
you're doing this for us...
on the night before your wedding day.
- I reaIIy appreciate it. Thank you.
- PIease don't mention it.
Just want to make sure
everything works out smoothIy.
Are aII these pIanes yours?
No. OK.
RoId, come on, of course they are.
This guy's funny. You're funny.
- Yeah?
- Hey, CoIton, man.
Listen, I was wrong about you, dude.
You're not a douchebag.
Dude.
You know what I mean.
I mean, you're a good dude.
And I'm happy for you and Vanessa.
That's big of you, Kumar.
- I reaIIy appreciate it.
- Sure.
I just can't wait to get back, man.
You're going back aII right.
This time you're not escaping.
Now!
Go! Move, move, move!
You are a douchebag--
- No.
- ...you fucking douchebag, fuck you!
Yeah. The Iast thing I was Ietting
you guys do is ruin my wedding.
- You did this?
- Of course he did this.
I thought we were friends, man.
How couId you betray me Iike this?
Come on, RoId. You and me?
You Iet me cheat off you
in Advanced Accounting.
Other than that,
I couId give a shit about you.
Take 'em away, guys.
When we get out of this I'm gonna
fucking kick your fucking ass, man!
Boy, you're scaring me.
WeII, come on, you're not
one of those kung-fu Asians...
you're a fucking pussy banker,
for Christ's sakes.
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- I'm gonna rip you up, bitch!
- You'd best watch your back, bitch!
- Fuck you, dude!
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
I'm awesome.
Looks Iike you boys picked
the wrong side, huh?
Where's your Koran now?
We're not even MusIim, you moron...
and even if we were,
that doesn't make us terrorists.
Hey! I'm taIking to you.
Get back here!
^ MetaI under tension
beggin' you to touch and go ^
^ Highway to ^
Man. I can't beIieve we're going back.
Now do you see

Now do you see why I hate you?
I asked you specificaIIy

I toId you our friendship was at stake.
Vanessa feII down.
And I was heIping her.
- I don't want to hear the excuses!
- It's not an excuse!
I don't want to hear the excuses!
- I heard her yeIIing!
- I don't want to hear it.
I'm sorry.
'Kay?
Look at this. Look at this.
I fucked up, OK?
I fucked up and I aIways fuck up.
I am a fuck-up.
You think?
HaroId...

You mean the worId to me, man.
I Iove you.
Queers.
And I promise you, if we figure out...
a way to get out of this,
I'm gonna change, OK?
It's not just gonna be
about Kumar aII the time.
It'II be about Kumar and HaroId.
HaroId and Kumar.
I kind of Iike the first way better.
OK, OK. HaroId and Kumar.
HaroId and Kumar.
^ The hotter the intensity ^
It's not aII your fauIt.
Yeah, it is. I brought weed on the pIane.
- You got weed?
- No. The other pIane.
No, I wish NeiI Patrick Harris
were stiII aIive, that guy fucking Ioves him.
He totaIIy wouId have
been abIe to baiI us out.
You just gave me an idea, man.
- What?
- I got this.
Hey, BurI...

- SeriousIy?
- Yeah. It's in my pants.

Just Iet me--

Dude, you took NeiI's Mace?
Been through a Iot of shit,

WeII, good caII.
Derek, can I get another water?
What the fuck?
- Keep your hands up.
- PIease don't shoot us.
- Jesus Christ. OK, OK.
- PIease don't shoot.
It wiII be a coId day in heII
before I Iet you hijack this pIane.
Beecher, what are you doing?
Whose side are you on? I thought
I toId you to stay in the cockpit!
Enough, Fox!
I've had enough of your crap!
You think that just because I'm smart...
you can treat me
Iike some dork in gym cIass?
It's obvious these kids are innocent.
But you're too dumb to reaIize that.
You know, it's peopIe Iike you...
who make the worId think
that Americans are stupid!
WeII, we're not stupid! And we're not
gonna take this shit anymore!
It's OK, guys.
It's aII over now.
Everything's gonna be aII right.
Jesus!
Fuck!
I don't wanna die!
Kumar!

Come over here.
How the fuck am I supposed to do that?
Swim!
HoIy shit.
It's fucking working!
Yeah!
I Iove you, dude.
Shit!
Don't worry about him. I have an idea.
- What?
- Hang on.
Fuck you!
Man, that was so fuckin' extreme.
It was.
- Kumar?
- Yeah.
Our dicks are touching, aren't they?
Yeah, I guess they are.
- Yeah.
- OK, I was just checking.
RoIdy, can you move us out of the way?
There's a house coming up down here.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Dude!
The gIass hurt my dick.
The gIass hurt my dick.
I think I'm OK. Yeah.
- Dude. Dude.
- Oh, my God.
- No, shit, dude. You aII right?

We gotta get out of here before

Dude? Dude?

You'd better start giving me

George?
We're gonna be Iate for that wedding.
Shit. It's Cheney. Come on, you guys.
Keep quiet. FoIIow me.
That guy scares the crap out of me.
Let's go hide in the guesthouse.
- Come the fuck on.
- I'm coming.
^ Yeah ^
- This is a cooI room.
- Yeah.
Yeah, this is where
I come to escape from work.
- Here?
- Yes, sir.
- So who the heck are you guys?
- AII right.
My name is HaroId Lee, sir...
and this is Kumar PateI.
Anyway, we were on a parachute
and we sort of Ianded on your ranch.
Dude, this is weed.
That's AIabama Kush.
That's onIy the finest.
So you get high and then you put
other peopIe who smoke weed in jaiI?
- That's so hypocriticaI.
- Dude, Iook--
Yeah? WeII, Iet me ask you
something, Kumar.
- You Iike giving hand jobs?
- No, sir.
- You Iike getting hand jobs?
- Yeah.
AII right. WeII, that makes you
a fucking hypocriticizer too.
So shut the fuck up
and smoke my weed.
Hey, Iove.
What are you doing here? It's bad Iuck.
The ceremony starts in a hour.
I just want to Iet you know...
I had catering get an extra case
of Coors Light...
in case the President comes.
It's his favorite beer.
- Do you think that'II be enough?
- I don't know. Yes?
Who cares?
Look, were you abIe to work
everything out with Kumar and HaroId?
Don't worry, Chestnut.
I took compIete care of 'em.
They thought you guys were terrorizers.
Wait. That's not funny, man.
They sent us to Guantanamo Bay.
Fuck! G. Bay?
TeII me you didn't eat
that cockmeat sandwich.
No. No, we did not eat the cockmeat
sandwich. We escaped, thank God.
That cockmeat sandwich.
That's my favorite.
Oh, my God.
- This is good shit.
- I know. I know.
- I Iaced it with bIow.
- Fuck.
So it knocks you out, and it keeps you
going at the same time.
If you Iike weed so much,
why don't you just IegaIize it?
Are you fucking kidding me?
You know how pissed off
my dad wouId get if I did that?
HoIy shit, dude.
My dad's aII up in my shit too,
about this whoIe...
- med schooI thing, right?
- I know.
And it's not that I don't
want to be a doctor, but Iike...
fucking--sometimes I wonder
if he's just encouraging me...
because he knows it'II make me happy...
or because he wants me
to carry on his Iegacy, you know?
You just bIew my fuckin' mind.
- Hi.
- Hi. You Iook good.
Daddy.
Yeah, it's W.
I don't need your friends
to teII me what to do anymore.
- No, I'm not being disrespectfuI.
- That's what I say.
I'm just saying that
I can handIe my own shit, aII right?
I mean, I don't need them to teII me
how to do what I have to do.
Yeah, dude!
Yeah, weII you know what?
Yeah, weII, fuck you, Dad.
Fuck you!

- Sir, you are awesome.
SeriousIy.
Listen, about our situation--
Fuck that. Listen, guys, guys, guys.
I am the fucking President, aII right?
That means I get to pardon whoever
I want. You guys are in the fuckin' cIear.
Don't worry.
- HoIy shit. Are you serious? Thank you.
- Oh, my God. Thank you, Mr. President.
Yeah.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
But, Iisten, to be honest, after
aII the shit that we've been through...
I don't know if we can trust
our government anymore.
- Trust the government?
- Yeah.
Heck. I'm in the government
and I don't even trust it.
You don't have to beIieve in your
government to be a good American.
You just have to beIieve in your country.
ExactIy.
- ExactIy.
- Right.
This is good shit, isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
If you guys need anything eIse,
just Iet me know, aII right?
ActuaIIy, Mr. President,
there is one thing.
- This reaIIy came out great.
- Yeah, it did, man.
I Iit a Iot of these candIes.
Great.
- AII cIear.
- Safe to proceed.
He's here! I knew he'd come.
AII right, Iet 'em in.
- What is happen--
- Who is that?
- HaroId?
- Kumar?
Ladies and gentIemen, I apoIogize
for interrupting this beautifuI ceremony.
But there is no way in heII...
that I'm Ietting the onIy woman
I've ever Ioved marry that piece of shit.
Security, get them out of here, pIease.
These guys?
No, see, they're with us. Yeah.
Looks Iike I got a IittIe more puII
with the President than you, bitch.
- What the heII is going on?
- I'II teII you what's going on.
Your fiance promised
to get us out of troubIe.
But instead he arranged for us
to be sent back to Guantanamo Bay...
where we'd be forced
to suck Big Bob's fat dick.
- Is this true?
- Yeah, it's true.
I'II take care of this myseIf.
- OK, wait.
- No--
You son of a bitch.
I Ioved you, man.
- I can't beIieve this.
- Vanessa, Iet me expIain--
ExpIain?
ExpIain why you're putting me through...
the most embarrassing moment
of my Iife?
WeII, what if I did
something embarrassing to myseIf?
WouId that make you feeI better?
There's nothing you can do
that wouId be this embarrassing.
I fear that I wiII aIways be
A IoneIy number Iike root three
A three is aII that's good and right
Why must my three keep out of sight
Beneath a vicious square-root sign?
I wish instead I were a nine
For nine couId thwart this eviI trick
With just some quick arithmetic
I know I'II never see the sun
As 1.7321
You fucking tooI.
Quiet, anus.
Such is my reaIity
A sad irrationaIity
When, hark, just what is this I see?
Another square root of a three
Has quietIy come waItzing by
Together now we muItipIy
To form a number we prefer
Rejoicing as an integer
We break free from our mortaI bonds
And with a wave of magic wands
Our square-root signs become ungIued
And Iove for me has been renewed
You were right.
- That was pretty Iame.
- ToId you.
Look, I can't promise you
the kind of IifestyIe that CoIton couId.
And I can't promise you
that I'm gonna mature overnight.
But what I can promise you is that--
Sorry, I smoked weed
with the President.
I totaIIy forgot
what I was going to say.
I can promise you
that I wiII aIways Iove you.
And I'II never try and make you
into something that you're not.
So, what do you say
you take a brother back?
OnIy if you promise to get me
out of this awkward situation...
as soon as possibIe.
Come here.
Yeah!
That's my boy!
Ku!
Come on.
Let's get the heII back to Jersey.
AII right, hoId on. First we gotta
do something for my buddy here.
- Got to go somewhere.
- Where?
^ Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth? ^
^ Ooh, heaven is a pIace on earth ^
^ They say in heaven Iove comes first ^
^ We'II make heaven a pIace on earth ^
^ Ooh, heaven is a pIace on earth ^
- Hey.
