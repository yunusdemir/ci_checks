Hi.
- Hi.
That's the one, right?
- Yes.
I think I'm going to be a dad.
- Oh?
Yeah.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
I'd better be getting on home.
- OK. 'Bye.
Say hi from me.
- Will do. See you.
What did Leo want?
- To pick up that MadMan.
What?
He's going to be a dad.
- Oh? That's OK.
Norway drew one all.
The second time in this World Cup.
All they needed
to do was beat Brazil.
They'd won all
their previous games.
They get there and
they can't play at all.
Bloody awful timing
on the part of their coach.
When I got there at 4:40
people were waiting outside.
When I got to Inco
they'd closed the place down.
Rats had chewed through
the ceiling during the night.
They'd closed it to get rid
of the rats, and then last night...
What rats?
- The rats at Inco.
They covered the floor
with flour last night-
- to see if the rats
waded around in it.
They can see their footprints.
Weird.
And today there’s this silver
wedding do on the fourth floor.
They've lived
in the same flat for 25 years.
Amazing they haven't got arthritis
from all those stairs.
And you get here
at seven minutes past five.
I can't stand people being late,
it's bad timing.
Fucking bad timing.
Seven minutes isn’t that much.
- You're meant to be here at 5.
It bugs me when people
don't show up on time -
- you can't plan things
with people like you.
It's kind of irritating.
Hi, Mum.
I'm fine... yes, I am.
I am pregnant.
Yes... yes...
8 weeks... just a minute, Mum.
...Hang on.
Mum? I'll call you back
in a moment, all right?
I promise. OK. 'Bye.
Is that it, then?
Yes.
- And it's certain?
Is it OK?
Yes.
Don’t you think...
Maybe it's not a good thing...
Will you come in here?
Why?
- Come on.
Can’t we get rid of some of this?
Why?
To make room.
- We hadn’t talked about it.
What do you mean?
- The baby.
We've talked about it
a thousand times.
And you said you wanted kids,
right?
With me?
- Sure.
I'm not having any more abortions,
right?
There's plenty of time.
- Yes, there's plenty of time.
But I want it now.
But at your pace...
Why move my things?
You can move your things.
I just want things to be different.
Now.
No reason
to get pissed off.
I'm not pissed off.
I don't want to
talk any more about it, OK?
What have you been doing today?
Not much.
I went to work.
Hi.
- Hi.
Congratulations.
- How did you know?
The old lady left a message
on my machine... exciting, right?
Is it good?
- Not much difference yet.
Oh...
What about you?
How are you taking it?
It's fine.
So your gear works after all.
It's not just blanks.
What about your tummy?
You can't see anything.
Not yet.
What's with the faggot?
Wythe grunting?
Problems? Are you sure?
- Everything's fine.
He's fine?
He's not bothered any more?
If he's fine, I'm fine.
Oh, that'll be mum.
Hi, Mum.
Hi.
No, Louis has come.
Want a word?
Oh, no, he’s just left.
... She's phoned 5 times today.
I haven’t time to talk to her.
It's fine.
So am I, you bet.
And you're going to be a granny!
Take good care of her, right?
Yeah, of course.
- I mean...
Yes.
Can we have a word?
- Yes, but I have to get to work.
We'll take a walk.
- My old baby clothes.
Can't I have them?
- We’re just going out.
Will you be back?
- I have to get to work, so...
I'll be back shortly.
- Will you bring them next time?
You know that’s a cemetery, right?
- Sure.
And Louise's nursery is right here.
- Yeah. So?
It's weird living next to
a cemetery and an nursery.
Oh, I don't know.
I live over a takeaway.
I once went in there.
Climbed over the wall,
pulled over a few headstones.
It's totally scary, man.
With big guard dogs.
We got out in a hurry.
Have you got any kids?
- Not that I know of.
Would you want any?
- When all's said and done, yes.
It's what we’re here for.
- Yeah...
You'd tell me if you had any.
- You'd be the first to know.
Hey, is something up?
- Not at all.
I just wanted to know
if you had any.
Are you sure, or what?
- Yeah.
Joe?
How did it go yesterday?
- It was shit.
Nothing but coloured bastards.
You always say that.
- They are always trouble.
Always.
They rush in and feel up the girls.
All of them.
You're such a git.
- It just isn't right.
I let some of them in.
- Just one and there's trouble.
They can't behave,
no matter what you do.
They're like wild animals.
Who's he?
My brother-in-law, Leo.
- Oh, you knocked Louise up?
He's going to be a dad.
- Get the kid educated.
School-wise.
- What do you mean?
The schools are full
of blacks and coloured.
Things will work out.
- He's so cheerful.
I'm not racist.
I eat falafel, too.
You’re just a git.
- Here comes trouble.
Two monkeys
and you've got trouble.
You can't come in.
- What?
You can't come in.
- Just for a look?
No way.
You're serious?
- 100%.
You can't come in.
- Are you taking the piss?
100%... you can't come in.
- Mellow out, man.
Let us in for a look.
- No fucking way.
Let's go in for a look.
- No way.
Fuck you.
I'm sick of all this.
They're nothing but trouble.
They get into a temper
just like that.
Do you know them?
- No.
I've seen one of them before.
- They're crazy.
He's got a gun.
- Fuck.
Get him inside.
Come and get it, you bastards.
May I come out?
I'd like to go now.
Hi.
- Hi.
I saw a guy get shot.
What?
Down at Louis'.
Some guys weren't allowed in,
and so they used guns.
Who?
I don't know who they were.
Is Louis OK?
Yes, he's OK.
Hi.
Hi.
You don't recognize me?
- No.
I've seen you at the video store.
You work there?
- Yeah.
Been waiting long?
- Ten minutes.
I work at the video store.
Yes.
'Bye.
How are you doing?
- Fine, thanks.
And you?
- Fine.
That's nice.
You work at the diner, right?
- Yes.
I go there sometimes.
- I thought I'd seen you before.
Yes, I work down at the video store.
Have you got the time?
- No.
Didn’t you rent Casino last week?
- Yes.
I think I was at work that day.
Was it good?
- Yes, it was OK.
I am going the other way.
See you.
Put it there.
Where?
- Here, on the wall.
OK.
Or what do you reckon?
- I reckon it'll go fine here.
It was also fine in the lounge.
And in the kitchen.
Or here, so you could look
at yourself having a crap.
Put it there.
- Sure?
Yes.
What do you think Leo'll think?
- Leo'll think it's fine.
You reckon?
- Yes. I'll hang it here, right?
That's right.
There.
Now I've done that, too.
- Two people become three.
I'm really looking forward to it.
- Are you?
Yes... Baby.
No, I don't think you can compare
Steven Seagal to Fred Williamson.
Sure you can.
- Impossible.
Anyway, I wasn't comparing.
I just say Williamson is king.
You can't say that.
You can't.
I might as well say
Steven Seagal is king; him, -
- Charles Bronson,
and Franco Nero.
And Fred Williamson.
And Bruce Lee?
Seventies stuff.
- Yes.
And the best ever made.
So what are Bronson and Franco Nero?
They use firearms. Guns,
like everyone else. Timeless.
After all, this is the nineties.
- Yes.
You like Steven Seagal
but not Bruce Lee.
That's what you’re saying.
- I just said Seagal is better.
Yes, you said Seagal is better.
He's fatter, that's all.
Cut the crap!
He's just well-built, strong.
You can't say that!
- He is!
He's a lump.
- Hey! When is Louis coming?
He said he'd leave at ten past.
- Ten past what?
I don't know.
Steven Seagal is fat.
Have you screwed her?
- What?
Her.
- Who?
Her you're thinking about.
What's her name?
- I don't remember.
What did you talk about?
All kinds of stuff.
Films, I think.
Films?
- Yes.
So you didn’t talk, then.
- Yes, we did.
No, you didn't.
You talked about films.
You haven’t talked to each other.
- Really.
It's abnormal.
Have you screwed her?
You haven't screwed her.
You haven’t touched her, either.
Is that the way you see girls?
To be talked to, not touched,
not screwed? It's abnormal.
Kitjo?
- Yes?
How are things?
- Hi.
Hi, Louis.
- Doesn't it need some paint?
I was thinking of replacing it.
- You've got more?
I've got one with Fred Williamson.
- Fred Williamson?
Shall we find it?
- No.
We're going to watch a movie.
- It'll only take five minutes.
We're going to watch a movie now.
Or what?
Is there time to go round the shop?
- I'll come with you.
I'll wait here.
- Shall we get you anything?
Beer.
Three beers. Tuborg.
Hi.
- Good evening.
What do you want?
- I’ll just have a look.
What do you want?
- Iced tea.
Peach.
Yes, OK, I'll have that one.
And these.
Anything else?
- Yes.
One of those?
- Yes.
Anything else?
- No, I don’t think so.
9, please.
- 9? For that?
It's the same anywhere else.
- No, it isn't.
It's cheaper down the street.
- No, the same.
What's the problem?
- I just think it's expensive.
Check your change.
Or the nigger'll cheat you.
What did you say?
Nigger.
And you can sit down, Mohammed.
What's the problem?
- You are. I'm tired of your kind.
You think you rule the place.
- I'm not listening.
Anything else? If not, you can leave.
Black bastard.
Go home and fuck your mother.
Get out.
Black bastard.
Black cunt.
I'm sorry about that.
- What kind of friends have you got?
Sorry.
OK? Sorry.
It's no good.
- No.
I said sorry, OK?
See you later.
There it is.
Take your beer, OK?
- Yes.
Oh? Yes.
Shit... there he goes.
He hadn't reckoned on that.
She's got one, too.
Where do all those guns come from?
What?
- Where do they all come from?
What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
If they need a gun,
one just appears.
Yes. It's a film.
- I know it's a film.
Hey, we're watching a film, OK?
- I just don't get it.
How come
they all know about guns?
You think about it a lot?
- Yes.
I don't know.
It's as if...
...all of a sudden
they all know how to fire them.
Even ordinary people like us.
- Why all this talking?
Who's talking?
- I am, because you are.
I wasn’t talking, Leo was.
- Don’t you think about it as well?
Doesn't he like this film or what?
- Sure. Let's watch it, OK?
Yeah...
It just doesn't look
like that in real life.
I saw a guy get shot a few days ago.
Louis was there as well.
It doesn't look like that,
does it?
I really don't know
what you’re on about.
One of Louis' friends got shot.
And then he began
beating the guy up.
You beat him up, didn’t you?
I really don't remember.
- No. You don't?
Not beating him up?
Have you ever shot anyone?
- No.
Any animals?
- No.
A rabbit?
- No.
Isn’t that an animal?
- Yes. Have you?
No.
Would you like to?
- No.
Can you get me a gun?
- What the fuck for?
For fun.
- They're not for fun.
Can you get me one?
- No.
What do you mean?
- I mean no. Are you stupid?
What do you mean?
- It's only a film.
You watch films, you know fuck at all.
You watch four films a day. OK?
Just don’t tell Louise.
She'd throw a fit.
Can you get me one?
- No.
An Uzi?
Oh. Yes...
He forgot to shut the door.
But he's shut it now.
And now it's blown up.
Got nothing to do?
- No, nobody's been in.
I've looked at the figures.
You serve 2000 beef burgers a year.
That's about 30 cows.
- I've only been here 6 weeks.
That makes 231.
Don’t you ever get bored?
- Sometimes.
What about you?
Are you bored?
Yes.
- Here?
Sometimes.
- How about doing some washing up?
OK.
Hi.
A cheese burger, a small fries,
and an iced water.
We've no ice, will plain water do?
- Sure.
Seen any films, then?
- Not since the last one.
And that wasn’t long ago.
- Oh, no.
What do you do, then?
- Do?
Otherwise.
I just come here.
Sometimes.
It's fun, isn't it?
- No.
Not specially.
Is it fun at the video store?
- Sure.
What do you do otherw...
- Do you watch many films?
10 or 12 a week.
- 10 or 12?
Don’t you ever get tired of them?
- No.
Have you got a favourite?
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
- I don't know that one.
You don't?
- No.
Oh? Do you like Bruce Lee?
I don't know him either.
- You don't?
Have you seen Wild at Heart?
- I've read the book.
Is it a book?
- Yes.
You don’t watch many films.
- No.
Why not?
I don't know.
I just read lots of books.
So do I, but...
- Oh? What kind?
It varies.
- Got a favourite?
No, I think they’re all good.
I can read a book like this
in a day.
In a day?
OK!
Joe? Hey, Joe?
A cheese burger and a small fries.
- Just a minute, I'm busy.
Sure you only want water?
- Sure.
Have you seen my pen?
- No.
Will you see
if it's fallen down there?
Down here?
- Yes.
No, it's not down here.
Fancy going to the cinema one day?
Why?
We could see a film.
- What would we see?
I don't know.
Something or other.
OK.
OK?
- OK. Yes.
When can you go?
- On Friday.
Yes? OK.
Is there a toilet I can use?
- Through the kitchen. On the right.
Straight through?
- Yes.
My name's Lenny, by the way.
- My name's Lea.
I love you.
It's been so long.
I miss you.
Touch me.
- I can't right now.
Touch me.
- I don't want to.
You always touch me.
What's the matter?
We haven't made love
since I got pregnant.
Do you find me disgusting?
No...
I'll be back shortly.
Won’t you stay?
- I'll be back shortly.
Please stay...
See you.
Good morning.
- Got anything with Hubert Selby?
Not with.
"By".
By him, by him, by him.
Yes, Last Exit To Brooklyn.
The Raven edition.
It's in the cellar.
Down the stairs, turn right.
The other side of the green
sliding door, under S.
OK, thank you.
- Think nothing of it.
Hi.
- Hi.
Are they your children?
- Yes.
How old is he?
- Milo is 9 months, Marco is four.
Hi.
- Hi.
How are you doing?
- OK. And you?
Quiet.
- Anyone around?
No.
Kitjo?
- No, not till later.
Have you seen this one?
- Which one?
This one.
- No, I haven't.
Why not?
Do you think it's disgusting?
A bit.
It's quite normal,
getting a blowjob from a fish.
Have you seen this one?
- Which one?
Is it real?
- Yes.
No way.
- Hold it.
Be careful, it's loaded.
With live ammo.
There's something inside?
- Yes.
What are you going to do with it?
- I don't know.
Where did you get it?
You got it from Louis, or what?
What are you doing tonight?
- Me? Going to the cinema.
What are we going to see?
- I don't think you're coming.
Why not?
- I'm going with someone.
You could come.
A girl?
- Yes.
You're taking her out?
- Yes.
That's nice.
- Yes.
No problem, then.
No, should it be?
In that case everyone is happy.
See you.
You don’t want to come, do you?
- No... See you.
You must see
what I bought yesterday.
Isn't it sweet?
- It's sweet.
I was so happy when I saw it.
- It's really sweet.
I went in and bought it without
even asking how much it was.
Hi...
Leo... Mika.
- Hi there.
Congratulations.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
I've also bought some baby clothes.
- May I see?
This way.
This is sweet, isn't it?
- Very.
A natural colour.
- It's lovely.
When you don't know
what you’re having, right?
I'm trying to give up cigarettes.
It's really hard.
May I hold him?
- Yes.
Try holding him.
- What?
Try holding him.
No.
- Oh, go on.
No, I don’t think so.
You might as well learn how.
- It wouldn’t do.
Oh, wow, it's late.
We'd better be getting home.
Thanks... Marco, come on,
time to go home.
It was nice meeting you.
Your children are really sweet.
- Goodbye.
Hold this.
- Right.
Did you remember her dummy?
- Yes.
OK... I'll phone you.
- Yes.
OK... 'Bye.
What were you thinking of?
Hey, I'm sorry.
Hey, sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry...
Sorry.
Hi, Louis.
I'm in the middle of something
right now.
Hi.
- How are you doing?
OK.
Fine.
- Something up?
No. I’m just in a bad mood.
Where is Leo?
At work.
Has anything happened?
Leo’s just so weird these days.
What do you mean, weird?
- Just weird.
Did he hit you?
It's OK. I'm OK now.
Don’t you dare do anything to him.
I just want to talk to him.
- Don't hurt him.
I just want to talk to him. Now.
- I don't need any problems now.
You won't have any problems.
See you, Baby.
Leo?
Hi!
What are you doing?
- Just sitting here.
Won’t you come up here, too?
I want a word.
Hey, we can go inside.
- No, come up here.
Up there?
- Come on!
What the fuck is
going on in your head?
What?
- What do you do it for?
Did your mum
bang your head or something?
What are you talking about?
- You know very well.
OK, why did you hit her?
Are we speaking
the same language now or what?
Listen, you fat pig!
It's not very cool,
hitting my kid sister.
You can get into
deep, deep shit for it.
If you ever touch Louise again
I'll rip your fucking head off.
You faggot.
See you later.
What are you staring at?
- You.
Why don’t you stare
at the film instead?
The view is fine here.
A bit comical, maybe.
- Got a problem?
You're asking me?
- Yes. What's your problem?
Aren’t you watching a film?
- I'm watching a great cartoon.
Out of the way! Hey!
We're watching this film.
Hey! Leo!
We can't see.
Move, will you?
Well? What can you do?
Nothing, man.
You think you’re a big man.
You're a fuckhead.
A fuckhead, man.
Stay out of my life.
Out of my and Louise's life, right?
Because you're a psychopath.
A fuckhead, man. A fuckhead.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Fuckhead.
Go change your diaper.
Chill out.
Stop that, will you?
Stay out of it.
Hey, it was just for fun, right?
It wasn't funny.
- See? There's nothing in it.
There's nothing in it.
Yes, but it wasn't funny.
What?
- It wasn’t funny.
Are we going
to have coffee or what?
Sorry.
OK?
Sorry.
OK?
- Yeah.
I overreact sometimes, right?
Friends again, right?
- See you, guys.
'Bye.
Leo, do you carry
that gun round with you?
No, of course not.
It was just for fun.
- For fun?
Yes, for fun.
I'll chuck it into the lake.
OK.
I think I'm going home.
See you.
'Bye.
How did it go?
With what?
- The girl.
Oh, it went fine.
Oh? Good.
I didn't show up.
Why not?
I don't know.
You've never seen Louise, have you?
- No.
I've got a shit job, a shit flat,
and now a family coming.
I've got nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
See you.
- You going now?
Yes. I've got to get to work early.
See you.
Won’t you stay and talk a bit?
It is early.
So not now.
'Bye.
- Bye.
Hi.
- Hi.
You're back early.
Louise?
Come in here.
- Two seconds.
No, come now.
What's going on?
I’ve just been playing around.
Where is my stuff?
- I just put it down there.
Why?
To see what it would look like.
This is my stuff;
you haven't moved any of yours.
All my stuff's gone.
Well...
if you mean the pictures, -
- we can just move them around.
Is it just that?
Didn’t we agree that I'd move
anything that needed moving?
Why are you so pissed off?
- Because it's my life.
Yes, but aren't I your life, too?
I mean... hey, if it's your stuff,
we can just put it back again.
We mustn’t fight.
Why did you tell Louis?
I didn’t tell him anything.
- Didn’t you tell him...
Tell him what?
- That I...
That I...
- That you what?
You told him I slapped you, right?
- No, I didn’t tell him that.
You did.
- No. He asked me.
See, you told him.
- I didn't, I'm telling you.
You're lying to me.
You're calling me a liar?
"I live with someone I don’t trust".
- What do you mean, "trust"?
Mean?
We live together.
Look what you're
doing to my life.
I'll put it back.
- You didn't ask.
Your life...
- You didn't ask.
What about your stuff?
- Aren't I your life?
Yes, and I look after you.
- I love you.
I'm having your baby
and you call me a liar.
Stop it!
- We're having a baby.
Yes... stop it!
Stop it.
You're ruining everything.
I was never asked.
Fuck, I don’t want a kid
in this shitty world.
Fuck, man, I told you
I didn't want that kid.
Hi, Mum.
Will you come and get me?
Hi, Mum... I've told you
not to phone me here.
Oh?
OK. Yes.
Hey, there he is!
What's your plan?
Shall we run him over?
No.
We'll take him to the factory.
How do we get him into the car?
- I don't know. Knock him out?
Go on, then.
- He'll run if he sees me.
Well, I'm driving.
- I'll have to get him, then.
Give me something...
- There's a bottle in the back.
Somewhere.
You’re just a snotface.
- Won’t you get me down?
What do you think?
You're a fucking fuckhead, man.
What the fuck
were you doing?
I warned you.
Help!
Nobody will ever hear you.
Help!
You really want to finish him?
- Yes.
Sure?
Sure.
Right. Come with me and
we'll fetch someone I know.
Louis?
Can you hear me?
It was an accident.
Hell, man.
Fuck!
No!
It was an accident, man.
Fuck you.
This is my friend.
He's always short of money.
For a hundred
he'll give you a shot of HIV.
OK.
I've only got 70.
Got a couple of tens?
Yeah, here's two tens.
And a packet of cigarettes.
- Yeah, OK.
What's going on?
No!
No! No!
No...
Scola...
Visconti.
The Planet of the Apes,
which is your favourite?
Number one.
Friday The Thirteenth?
- Three.
Number three.
- You can't be serious.
It's the pits.
Number 1 is the best...
Hey, why do you always
talk about films?
What?
- You always talk about films.
Where are we?
- There are other things.
Sure. What do you mean?
- Lots of things.
There are other things in life.
- Yep. You sound just like my mum.
See? Even your mum says so.
- I don't often talk to her.
Why not?
- Because I always talk films.
See? You must begin
to talk about other things.
Nature.
- What about it?
Fish leaping in the lake,
cycling with the wind in your hair.
The beach.
- Why? It doesn't interest me.
Are you mad now?
- No, it's OK, it just seems...
You're not mad.
- No.
Hey, are you sure?
Is it OK?
- OK.
May I talk to Louise?
Hey ho.
I just wanted to say I love you.
I lost the baby.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Fuck, fuck, fuck...
Hey, Louis.
Hello?
Shall we go in?
Come on, we'll be late.
I don't feel like it.
Why not?
I just don't.
We have to say goodbye
at the graveside, right?
Come on.
Will you stop that?
I said I don't want to.
I'm going home.
It's not OK. I don’t want to.
I'm going home.
I think I got piles.
Oh?
How do you get those?
- I don't know. Lousy food.
I don't eat much soup.
Do they hurt?
You can't sit down.
I've been offered a job.
Oh?
- Down at Playtime.
Are you going to take it?
I don't know.
What do you think?
It's up to you.
I'd have to change buses and stuff.
What shall we watch on Thursday?
MadMax or If?
MadMax.
- Naw...
Let's watch If.
Lindsay Anderson.
OK.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry I didn't come.
That's OK.
Did you see a film?
- I couldn't be bothered.
Hey, is it still fun here?
- No, still just as boring.
Doing anything tonight?
- No.
Shall we go to the cinema?
I don't know.
I don't know if you'll show up.
- I can just wait here.
I don't get off for another 2 hours.
- That's OK, I'll wait.
Oh, OK.
What shall we see?
- I don't know.
You know best.
Armageddon.
Have you seen Armageddon?
All right.
- You'd like to see it?
Sure... it's kind of action?
- Yes.
Real action.
You like action.
- Yes. I do. Don’t you?
Well... I don't know.
It's entertaining.
Would you prefer something else?
- No, Armageddon is OK.
What are those blue ones?
- Mineral water, flavoured. Try one?
Yeah.
- Want one?
Want a glass, or is that OK?
- No, no.
For my mum.
