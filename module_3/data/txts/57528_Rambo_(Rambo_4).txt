The record exploded into
something they had never seen...
which liberated
the yellow horrific violence
In Burma, the hard line military regime
causes increasing
international concern.
The regime crushes all dissent...
as many as 10,000 were killed
throughout the country during 19...
in an actual uprising.
Thousands were killed by the Junta.
Some form of chemical weapon
has been used in Burma by military...
Thousands took to the streets
and thousands are already...
Many peaceful monks has been killed,
some by rifle and others drowned...
foreign journalist
have been shot and killed...
thousands of villages have been destroyed.
Rape and torture are a daily occurrence.
In Burma, there are more land mines
than anywhere in the world
young men are beaten and forced
into the army,
many as young as 12 years old.
Be-headings and mutilations
are commonplace...
The Karen people, comprised
mostly of poor Christian farmers,
have been singled
out for extermination.
The military government wants the
abundant  natural
resources on Karen land.
The Burmese military
campaign against the Karen people
has been going on for almost 60 years...
the longest running
civil war in the world.
Number 1 in Thailand.
They are Siamese Cobra
or common cobra.
It is not King Cobra and not just plain cobra.
Fuck off, okay?
Be careful you my friend.
Looks like dangerous work.
I'm Michael Burnett,
do you have some time to talk?
It won't take long, I promise.
I was told it might be possible to
rent your boat, we'd like to do that.
Is that possible?
We need to get upriver.
Where you goin'?
Into Burma.
Burma's a war zone.
Well, that's what people call it...
but it's more like genocide than war.
Anyway, this will be my 5th trip in
so, we are aware of all the risks.
I don't go that far north.
Let me explain our situation.
Our church is part of
the Pan-Asian Ministry...
located in Colorado.
We're all volunteers
who around this time of year...
bring in medical supplies,
medical attention
prayer books, and
support for the Karen tribes people.
People say you know
the river better than anyone.
They lied.
Look, what I'm asking is that
we compensate you for
a few hours of your time
that will help change peoples' lives.
Are you bringin' any weapons?
Of course not.
You're not changin' anything.
Well.
It's thinking like that
that keeps the world the way it is.
Fuck the world.
Let's go.
- Why?
He's not interested.
Let's go.
Let me try.
Sarah.
You said it was the only way there.
- I know.
- Then what do we have to lose?
Just let me try, please.
Hello?
I'm Sarah Miller.
I hope you don't mind
me coming back here.
The man that you were talking to...
I wasn't talkin' to anybody.
All right, the man
that was talking to you
asked if we could hire
you to take us up the river.
You said no.
Why?
Can't help you out.
Well, if you have good reasons,
would you mind if I heard them?
Go home.
Why'd you come back?
Waiting for you.
I told you before, I can't help you.
We need to go and help these people.
We're here to make a difference.
We believe all lives are special.
Some lives, some no.
Really? If everyone thought like you,
nothing would change.
Nothing does change.
Of course it does,
nothing stays the same.
Live your life,
it's a good one.
That's what I'm trying to do.
No, what you're trying to
do is change what is.
And what is?
Go home.
Really, go home.
Maybe, maybe you've
lost your faith in people.
But you must still be
faithful to something.
You must still care about something.
Maybe we can't change what is.
But trying to save a life
isn't wasting your life, is it?
As bad as these people are
they will eventually lose.
They can't keep it up
against a united front, they can't.
I mean time alone will tell,
but in the meantime we just have
to help them hold it together.
Just the other day, I read...
Excuse me, Sarah.
Where are you going?
To talk to him.
He probably wants his privacy.
You shouldn't ignore him.
He's helping us.
He's being paid.
He didn't take anything.
Thank you, again, for doing this,
really, from all of us.
You know,
you never told us your name.
John.
Where are you from?
Bowie, Arizona.
Why'd you leave?
I got drafted in 'Nam.
And you just stayed?
It's complicated.
Do you have family back home?
Father maybe, I don't know.
Aren't you curious to see how
things might have changed back home?
Don't have a reason for that.
Sarah.
Are you sure
you want to go upriver?
Any time you want to turn around,
I'll stop.
Okay.
What is it? Who are they?
Burmese pirates.
Tell everyone to stay down.
Don't make a sound.
- It's all right.
- Don't talk!
Are there more of them?
Maybe.
What do you want to do?
We should keep going.
We made a commitment.
I ain't talkin' to you.
What do you wanna do?
We're a group here.
if they want to vote...
Sit down.
If it's money they want...
Nobody talks. Heads down.
Keep your heads down, don't look 'em
in the eye or they'll kill you.
Don't look!
No!
What did you do?
We came to help stop the killing!
Who are you to take...
Who are you?
Let him go!
They would've raped her 50 times...
and cut your fuckin' heads off.
Who are you?
Who are any of you?
We're goin' back!
No.
No, we shouldn't go back.
Let go.
What are you doing?
We are so close!
What happened here... is horrible.
But the people there
are killed like this everyday.
Michael.
This was your idea.
We made a commitment.
I know you don't believe
in what we're doing.
But it's our life.
Our choice.
You're not gonna change anything.
Please.
Please, John. Please.
Go sit down.
We'll be taking the overland route
on the way back
so there's no need to wait around.
I have to report this.
I know you think what
you did was right, but taking a life
is never right.
I don't know what to say.
Maybe you shouldn't say
anything, should you?
Good luck.
Open
With power, through his spirit,
in your inner being...
So Christ may dwell
in your hearts with faith.
And I pray...
You may have power
together with all of us.
Well, let me see if
I can fix this little problem, okay?
Hey you.
Hand me one of those bandages?
Okay.
Good.
Okay.
Get outta here!
What about them?
Go on, I'll take them!
Fireman here, calling Raven.
Come on in, Raven.
What am I? You made me.
A full-blooded combat soldier.
You just don't turn it off.
Talk to me Johnny
You just don't turn it off!
It's over.
Nothing is over!
When are you gonna come full circle?
I know the reasons you're here.
Aren't you curious to see how things
might have changed back home?
You've done enough damage.
You're always gonna
be tearing away at yourself...
until you come to terms
with what you are and you come full-circle.
So you are just going
to stay here forever?
John!
I wanna go home.
John Rambo!
John?
John Rambo?
My name is Arthur Marsh...
pastor of the Christ Church in Colorado.
I need to talk with you.
It's very important, I wouldn't
come here like this if it wasn't.
The morning of the day the group left...
Michael Burnett notified me
that they were
traveling from this location.
What happened?
No one knows, exactly.
They were supposed to return 10 days
ago, but they never came back.
I requested help from the Embassy,
but they can't help.
Not in Burma. And not in time.
How do you know they're alive?
Because we've been in contact with
the Karen Freedom Fighters who say
they think they know
where they were taken.
And I was given the name of an ex-military
American local from the embassy,
who put me in touch with men
who say they have experience in
this part of the world.
Mercenaries.
Yes.
I don't have any other choice.
You know the exact spot.
We need you to take these
men to where you let our people off.
When are they ready to leave?
When you are.
You know what you are.
What you're made of.
War is in your blood...
don't fight it.
You didn't kill for your country.
You killed for yourself.
God's never gonna make that go away.
When you're pushed...
killing's as easy as breathing.
# my head was mangled
and my words were torn. #
# covered in blood
like a newly born. #
# hey, the wishing well. #
# sing it soft and low. #
# I stayed for a while
in the hollow sound. #
# the only water came
up from the ground. #
Look at this fucking place.
Only a fucking ape would live here.
What the fuck am I doin' here?
Hey! Knock that shit off!
Seems you don't like the arts.
En-Joo don't like shit.
I like your sister, Diaz.
She's got a thing for retards.
Hey, boatman.
How much longer on
this ancient piece of shit?
So what did the Reverend say to you?
Some shit about how
his flock got missing.
I said, look here mate,
that's what you get when you go
trespassing into fucking Burma...
that's what you get when you go sniffing
around other people's garbage.
You know those
generals in there makin'
millions crankin' out meth more than
any other place on the fuckin' planet.
Bullshit.
Millions, moron.
How do you think
they pay for that shit army?
Try readin' the paper redneck,
instead of sleepin' under it.
Fuckin' generals,
biggest junkies of all of 'em.
It's noble, Lewis.
- You what?
Those people goin' in there
with no weapons. Just books and meds.
It's noble.
Fuck! Schoolboy.
You stick your noble nose
into other people's business
you get fucked up
or you get dead.
I'm only reason I'm doing this
is for an ex-wife and 3 kids.
After this shit's over,
you can shove that soldiering up your ass.
Try to be careful, mate.
Fuck off.
And you, I don't wanna fuckin' die
of old age before I get there.
So move.
You say something?
# sing it to yourself,
sing it all night. #
# spent a lotta time
in the garbage can... #
# fightin' over food
with the garbage man. #
# hey, the wishing well #
Bring that one out to the pigs.
# I was diggin' a well,
with an old blood stain #
# poking around with
a blind man's cane #
Is it me?
Or does the air this time of year
smell like a goddamn wet dog?
# he fell in my well like a... #
For God's sake,
I could swim faster than this.
Am I right?
You're dead.
Come on, chop, chop.
The quicker we get there,
the quicker we get back.
They come over here,
spoutin' all that shit.
And they expect the whole world
to work like their fuckin' neighbor.
Well, it doesn't.
So they send in a devil...
to do God's work.
It's ironic, isn't it?
Am I boring you, mate?
Or is it... is it the trip?
Has it got you nervous?
You should appreciate the action
you know what I mean.
It's gotta be better than
lookin' at the ass end of a snake.
Oh dear. You really are an
uptight bastard, aren't you?
You can drop that fancy ass stare.
I've seen it all before.
And I'm not that impressed.
He's old school SAS.
A first rate soldier but
told to be gone maniac.
They call me Schoolboy.
The name stuck with
me since sniper school.
And me mates won't stop calling
me that no matter how many people I shoot.
# still as patiently,
but time is... #
What do you want from us?
One man and a kid.
You gotta be fuckin' joking.
Is this all the rebels they've got?
I'm not likin' it.
We're in a fuckin' jungle,
there's nothing to like.
My name is Bien. This is Tha.
Is this it?
Yes.
What's up with the kid, man?
He good tracker.
We don't need a tracker,
we need a fuckin' guide.
You know the exact location, right?
10 kilometers west, two north,
six hour walk.
How many soldiers?
100, maybe.
100?
- What'd he say?
More new soldiers come tomorrow.
I'm just a white trash grunt,
but I can count.
Fuck fuckin' with a 100...
Let's get this straight.
We don't engage anybody.
If we can extract these people, good.
But it's in, out, clean or we fuck off.
Somebody wanna tell me
what the boatman's doin'?
Why aren't you waitin' with the boat?
My men are stayin' with the boat.
You're the boatman. You stay here.
I won't slow you down.
I know you won't,
it's not a fuckin' nature hike.
You can believe that.
He could hang with me at the back.
He's the boatman.
He stays with the fuckin' boat.
I want a white man on it,
not some fucking dink.
Who has explosives?
Brewster?
None.
Round of C4 and primer.
I got a Claymore.
All right.
Let's get on with it.
Come on, move.
What the fuck is that?
Called Tallboy Bomb.
English dump in World War II.
Your people.
Taken from here.
Man, I have seen some shit.
but I ain't never
seen no shit like this.
Weird.
Check it out.
Armies come.
Kill everything.
Leave our dead here as warning.
Go home. Tha hurry!
Mines everywhere.
Watch where you are walking.
Alright, let's move on.
To what?
They even killed the fuckin' dogs.
Those people are dead.
I'm with En-Joo.
We'll at least have to go have a looksee,
check it out.
- I'm with you, let's check it out.
Check what? They're 100 strong!
Hey, we took the man's money!
Hey, hey, hey.
Just calm down.
Calm down.
We go then. And we see what's what.
If anything's wrong, anything at all...
we leave.
All right?
Yeah.
All right.
Okay.
Which way?
This way.
Army!
Go! Go!
Should we fire on 'em?
No. If they don't make it
back to wherever they came from
they're onto us.
You hold the money.
I bet the one on the end.
What the fuck are they doin', man?
How long before they go missing?
Three hours. Maybe four.
Who are you, boatman?
Let's move.
Move? They'll hunt us down
when these guys don't show up.
We don't need this shit.
We're going back to the boat.
Any of you boys wanna shoot,
now's the time.
And there isn't one of us
that doesn't wanna be someplace else.
But this is what we do.
Who we are.
Live for nothin', or die for something.
Your call.
What's your call?
Let's move.
Once Schoolboy's on the tower,
we got 15 minutes.
Set your watches to 1:45.
We ain't waitin' around for nobody.
We'll meet at the base of the tower.
If he don't make it up there, we're fucked.
He will.
All set?
We're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Don't talk.
Where's the girl?
She's over there.
You untie him.
We'll be back for you.
Here!
Come.
There's two men are in the cage
near the pigs. Get 'em.
Got it.
Come on, come on!
Where's Sarah?
Shut up, come on.
Let's move!
Where's boatman?
And Sarah.
15 minutes. That's the
deal. We're leaving.
- Let's go.
5 more minutes.
Bullshit.
He knew the deal.
If we're getting away,
we fucking leave together!
Your life.
Let's go.
Not without her.
God didn't save your life.
We did.
Now fucking get up.
Get up.
Move!
This way.
- You got us covered?
- Yes.
Why'd you come back?
Why did you?
An hour till daylight.
This way.
My leg, my leg, Jesus, goddamn it.
Shut up, shut up,
we're getting you out.
His leg is broken.
- Oh shit.
Where's the guide?
That son of a bitch is gone.
Fuck him, I know the coordinates.
We're not going to make
it to the river without him.
Take off his boot.
- No!
Leave his boot on.
Let us in here, we're doctors.
I need a knife.
Here, here, here.
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Will he make it?
I don't know.
Make a stretcher.
Spread out!
Take the point.
You hear that?
They're tracking us.
Turn around.
What are you doing?
Just move.
What?
- Turn, turn.
I want you two to head
southeast to the river.
The boat'll be waiting.
If it's not there...
you can follow the shoreline till I find you.
What about you?
I'll be all right.
Give me that Claymore.
Now fire off a shot.
What?
Fire off a shot!
Go!
Go!
Come on!
Come on! Move it!
Move it! Let's go.
I got you.
Let's move
Get down, get down, get down.
What, what are you gonna do?
Son of a bitch.
Look.
- What is it?
Oh, God.
Oh god damn it!
You gutless fuck!
You fucking gutless shits.
Gutless fuck!
Have another go at me you lady cunt!
Come on you, fuckin' have a go at me!
Fuck! You fucking fucking Jesus!
Oh God.
What do we do?
Nothing we can do.
No!
The rebels.
Michael.
Michael.
Michael.
Michael?
Michael?
Michael?
Michael!
It's okay.
We'll help them. Okay.
