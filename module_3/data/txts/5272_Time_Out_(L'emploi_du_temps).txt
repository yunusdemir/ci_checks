It's not alright. Get up.
You gotta get up. Come on. Let's go.
Sheila's a friend of mine.
She lives here. I always stay here.
- I don't know who Sheila is.
- It's okay. It's fine.
- Whoever was here was evicted, alright?
- It's fine, it's fine.
It's not fine.
Come on, get up. Let's go.
Monday.
- What're you doin'?
- She's comin' back.
- There's nobody comin' back, buddy.
- She told me she's coming back.
I'm just gonna wait here.
There's nobody here. Didn't you notice
nobody lives here? How'd you get in here?
Hey, listen to me, buddy,
you got two minutes, alright?
- Do what you gotta do, then you gotta go.
- No, no, no, no, no, no. No.
Can't do. There are laws.
She's gonna take you to court case. No.
Cannot do.
She's comin' back here soon.
She'll be fine.
- Alright, that's it. You gotta go.
- I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
I wanna stay here. She wanted me
to wait here for her.
- So I'll stay here.
- Nobody comin' back.
- You wanna wait, wait outside.
- She's comin' back. She's not gonna lie to me.
I'm here with her. This is my home.
This... this is my home.
Wait outside. You don't live here,
alright? I'm serious.
What're you doin'?
Did... did she...
Did she leave a number?
- I don't even know who you're talking about?
- An address or something? Anything?
- No. Time to go.
- Sheila.
Let's go.
Well, where's my...
where's my stuff? Where's my stuff?
I don't know where your stuff is.
Look around and then you gotta get out.
Come on.
- Hey.
- Is everything alright?
- Yeah. It's a pigsty.
- You're kidding, right?
No, I'm tellin' you.
Well, I'm goin' upstairs now.
The whole ceiling has collapsed...
Hold on. I'll call you back.
Hello?
Anybody in there?
Hello?
Anybody home?
Hello?
Hello?
What do you want me to say?
I mean, he's your dad too.
He's gotta eat.
If he doesn't eat, then what?
You have to stay there.
It takes him, like, an hour and half
but that's what it takes.
- 2500?
- I said 2500.
- Oh, give me a fuckin' break.
- Give you a break?
This guy. Not now, buddy. I told you,
I'm sorry. I can't help you, alright?
I just wondered, could I borrow
some money? Someone took my wallet.
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry whatever happened.
I just wanna find my lady.
I wanna find her...
You're not gonna find her here.
I told you she's gone. What are you doin'?
- What are you doin'? Come on.
- Thank you, mister. Thank you.
- What the fuck did you do that for?
- What do you care?
Come on, work with me, alright?
I can't do it for less than 4500.
- 2500.
- You want half a job?
- Look, just do it for 25.
- You want me to do half the work?
What... Look, just do it for 25.
You know, put me down for 25.
You know? You think you can.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Yeah.
You know there are options.
I've told you that so many times.
You know what?
You and me, we need to go out.
Tonight. We can go... I'm sorry?
How about Saturday?
Me and you, we can hit that spot...
How crazy is that?
Hey.
Hello.
Yes.
Who is it?
Quién es?
- Stop ringing that bell whoever you are.
- I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
It's just some guy. Don't worry about it.
Relax. I'm gonna take care of it, alright?
Thanks.
Jesus Christ!
Hey. Hey!
- Come on. Wake up.
- Oh, good. I wanted to talk to you.
I spoke to Sheila. I spoke to Sheila.
She said, you know, that we should
stay here and wait with her. She's...
- Wait outside, okay?
- She... she's...
- Come on. You gotta get up.
- I spoke to her. She was on a payphone.
Go outside and wait. You can't wait here.
You can't sleep here.
You cannot come back here.
Alright? Let's go. Come on.
Hey. You alright?
What's the matter?
- Hey, look.
- Cut me some slack, man.
Come on. Come on. I'm not bothering
anybody. I'm not bothering anybody.
You're scaring the neighbors.
Alright? Come on.
Get some sleep.
Okay, okay.
Get some sleep. Get some sleep.
Get some sleep.
- Go!
- Jesus!
- Hey!
- You nailed him!
I don't think so.
- Really?
- No.
Do you think we could, please?
Hey. Hey, guys.
Could I borrow some money?
Hey, somebody stole my wallet.
I just I want to get a metro card.
I just need it for a metro card,
that's all.
Bird and the bees.
If you horny, you horny.
Now, look. I get horny. Oh, now...
Keep your belongings in sight
at all times. Protect yourself.
If you see a suspicious package
or activity on the platform or train...
Can I just have your attention
for a couple of minutes.
I just need a little bit of help.
I have a couple of small children
and I wanna go and visit my husband
who hasn't seen the kids in a while.
He's not doing that well.
Have it in your hearts
to just give me a little something.
Shit.
If you want to calm
your anxiety in your case,
you try to lose a bit of weight,
it could be whatever you like.
One thing you can do is...
run it through water, running water
or if you're going camping,
in a river...
- Happy.
- Really?
- Am I making you happy?
- Yeah.
Are you sure? You were saying,
"No, no, no, no, no."
I thought I was making you mad.
I thought I was making you mad.
Stop, stop.
- Oh, well, that's a friendly hello.
- Yeah.
- I needed a little bit of the old...
- You like that? Do that again.
Do that again, do it again. Do it again.
Kiss one of these? Kiss one of those.
It's pretty much a sweet spot, so...
So bloody good.
- They love music.
- The women are beautiful.
They actually care.
Not like here. They...
They don't care as much about...
Robert?
Robert.
Robert? Vanilla half caff soy latte.
You're gonna be around
next time I come back?
Yeah.
I'm kind of constantly around,
it's funny.
Yeah? Well, it's good to know.
Yo.
Man.
Look, I feel like you're gonna be late.
- No, that's okay.
- I'm gonna be late, man.
- You should come have a drink with me.
- Oh, no, I can't, babe. I got to go.
I got responsibilities and such. But...
- But I got...
- Just stay.
Got to grab a taxi.
Alright, call me up.
Alright. But I promise I will call you
when I get back to the city, alright?
- Yeah, it was fun.
- Alright.
No, okay, well... put her on the phone.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, please.
- Hold on.
- Okay.
No, come on.
I'm serious.
Hold on.
- Hello?
- I'm back.
I wanna go...
Hey, I can't really talk right now.
Yeah.
I've got a... I've got a...
I've got a drink inside.
What? What is it?
I agree. It's... it is very important.
It's just now is not a good time.
What? What is it? What do you...
what do you want to say?
Hey! You alright?
- You're waiting for somebody or what?
- No, no, no.
- Can I help you?
- No. No, no, no. No.
You can... have right now? I'm just...
Out. I'm... out, out.
Yes! Yes!
Reinforcements have arrived.
- How are you? You're good?
- I'm good.
Misunderstanding 'cause I don't think
I was accusing you of anything.
The way that I talk to you?
I was just upset.
It's like 2 in the morning and...
I want to go to bed with you
and not wanting to fight.
- Let me talk to you a second.
- Sorry. You want to talk?
- No, I'm talking to someone.
- Hold on a second.
You see the barmaid, the blonde?
Would you give these to her?
It'll make her very happy.
- You want me to give these to this...
- Yeah. It's good. It's good.
It's good.
- What is this?
- It's good. You give them to her.
Okay.
- Okay?
- Yeah, I just... okay. Thank you.
Shit.
Someone just gave me pictures to give
to... look, I got to go. It's loud.
There's fire trucks
and I'm just gonna go, okay?
I'm... let me call you... let me
call you when I'm done, okay?
I'll call you... I'll call you
when I'm leaving.
Okay? Okay. Okay.
- Maggie.
- Yep.
This guy gave me
these pictures to give you.
Is that you?
This... this little girl,
looks like you.
What?
What are they?
You alright?
Yeah, I'm all good.
We need pint glasses.
Get it. Go. Make it happen.
Hi. What's up?
Just watch me, okay?
This homeless guy is in here.
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
You want me to come in there?
- No, I want you to watch.
- What am I watching?
If my throat gets slit, you tell my mother
it was because you were too lazy
to come in here.
- I'm gonna... I'll come in there...
- No! Don't! Are you crazy?
Don't leave Tucker in the car
by himself. Just watch me.
I told you I could pick up the money in
the morning. How does that make me lazy?
- What's happening?
- You want some help?
What's happening?
Sir?
Sir, wake up. You alright?
You're in the emergency room.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You feeling alright?
Yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine.
Sir, do you remember how you got here?
Are you waiting for anyone, love?
Yeah, yeah, yes.
I guess they left already.
I fell asleep.
- Well, can I help you in any way?
- No, no, I'm fine. I'll be fine. Thank you.
You know there's a food pantry
in the mornin'
at St. Bart's on 51st Street
if you're hungry.
When I call, they usually bring around
some food about half five at night.
No, I don't, I...
I think I better go home.
I'm just a little bit...
Sheila is gonna be worried sick.
I better get back.
You don't have to go. You can stay.
No one will bother you here.
Don't tell anybody I told you
that though, okay?
My grandmother
on my mother's side was Irish.
Just enough.
Do you like it here?
- You mean the hospital or...
- No, no, no, America.
You know, your accent. You haven't
been here very long, have you?
- Long enough.
- Yeah.
No, I like it here.
I like it when I can get some sleep
which should be hopefully very soon.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know...
I've always been really,
very good with women.
Women have always...
been incredibly kind to me.
And... I really have no...
place to go right now and...
I'm not a bum. I'm clean.
I'm a very, very clean guy.
I'm not a bad guest, really.
I just... I'm in between.
Sorry.
See you next week.
- Alright.
- Okay, later.
Yeah, see you later.
...and all those other terrorist
groups are watching all this.
How the Hollywood media is doing...
it's getting into our homes and our...
Okay.
She said she's gonna look
over my resume.
Well, they should get back to me,
I guess, in a day or so.
I know. I hope I get in too.
- No.
- No?
It's a little bright.
Are you here for English
as a second language?
Meditation Mondays?
Oh, I'm just looking for a coat.
Hey! Hey, listen, you can't stay here.
- It's not a Code Blue night.
- It's okay. It's alright.
- No, it's not a Code Blue night.
- I'm just sitting here.
No, no, no. No, you can sleep here
if it's 32 degrees below.
- But it's not 32 degrees below. Come on.
- Do you need to see a doctor?
- No, he does not...
- If you're not feeling well...
- If you need some medical treatment.
- What temperature is it outside?
It's more than 32.
You have to go. I'm sorry, sir.
- There's wind chill. No.
- Please, sir.
- There's a really bad wind.
- No. Listen...
I can't do anything about it.
Please don't make my life miserable.
- I'm not bothering anybody here.
- It does not mat...
- Do you know where Bellevue is?
- You can stay here.
The homeless intake center? Go there.
- It's 30th and 1st Avenue.
- I can't believe this. There's nobody here.
It doesn't matter.
I don't wanna get in trouble.
I'm sorry, sir, about your situation.
Just please go.
- I don't wanna have to call the cops.
- Sorry.
Thank you.
What? I can't. No.
And I said... I told her, I told her.
A couple of days ago my husband
found out where I live.
And he tossed me around the kitchen
and I hurt my back too.
Come on.
And I told her and I was hurt.
That's it. I made a mistake.
I made a mistake. Stupid.
As you enter the facility
please take all outerwear off.
Belts off.
All items out of your pockets.
Remove all hats, scarves.
Any unauthorized items,

As soon as your stuff

Once your stuff is cleared from the x-ray

One at a time. One at a time.
Sir, please remember to remove all items
and your belt please. Thank you.
Look, all I... I'm just looking for a...
place for a couple of nights
'cause it's over 32 degrees outside.
- Look... that's...
- Just a little while.
That's not what I'm asking.
Okay? I'm looking for your name.
I wanna see if you've been already
assigned a shelter. Don't bust my balls.
No, no, I'm sorry. I...
Look, can I just get...
a bed for one night.
- Do you have any form of ID?
- No. I don't.
Do you have anybody you can call? Anybody
you could stay with? A friend's couch?
- I don't have... I don't have anyone.
- Nothing?
Look, are you filled up or something?
Bec... is that...
I could come back later
if it's... if that's better.
- There's no later.
- No.
The law says we have to give you a bed.
Yeah. Okay. Well, I could...
Any place is fine. Anything you got.
I mean the floor is fine with me.
I just need a blanket. A blanket
makes me sleep better. I like a blanket.
- Okay, you'll stay here tonight in a bed.
- Okay. Good.
We'll evaluate you. If you qualify,
you'll be assigned a permanent shelter.
A what?
- A place where you could stay.
- Permanent?
It's up to you. We have all kinds.
It's been a long time since I had a job.
It's been many years. I'm...
I'm too old to be hired.
No one's gonna hire me like...
not like I am. I'm just... I'm...
I'm really no good right now.
Well...
Look at me, man.
9/11 blew my brains out.
I had to crawl out of a ditch.
If you know what I mean.
I don't know what you mean.
I was on your side of the glass once.
Yeah.
So how much is it?
- What?
- A bed, how much is a bed tonight?
- For one night?
- No. Listen...
'Cause I don't have much.
I don't have... I don't have...
Matter of fact I don't have anything.
I'm kind of in between...
Have a seat.
Why?
I'll kill you! I don't care! You can
give me the death penalty. I don't care!
What up, man? Look,
back up off me, back up off me!
- You don't care about me!
- Are you okay?
They sent me here. He says I gotta go back!
That's not fair! That's not fair!
You're not listening to me.
Listen to what I'm saying!
Listen! He said that
I'm supposed to come here.
They sent me here! They sent me...
Back up! Back up off me, okay?
- Listen to what I'm saying!
- I don't care! I'm out of here.
He said if I go back,
I'm gonna kill you!
Look, you're not listening to me.
What are you doing?
I can't do that. I'll kill him.
I swear I'll kill him.
- I got diabetes. He don't care! He don't care!
- Can we get you somethin' to eat?
He don't even got that.
He don't respect me.
They sent me from...
They said come here.
They said come here. He said go back.
He said after one more night
I can come back here.
- I got diabetes.
- Damn it. Fuck!
He's trying to kill me!
Where did you live last?
I... I've been moving around
for a while.
No, sweetie, where...
did you come from... before here?
- Where was the last place you resided...
- Sheila's.
Oh, Sheila. So where's Sheila?
Queens? I don't know.
- Could you go back there and stay...
- No, no, she was gone. She was evicted.
She... she... she didn't say goodbye.
She didn't take it to court.
She didn't do anything.
Stupid cow. She knew
I had no place to go.
Okay, so no staying with the cow.
How about family? You got a family?
If I say I have a family
does that mean I can still stay here?
Yes, unless they'd be willing
to take you in.
- I don't have a family.
- Okay, come on, darling...
You would much rather stay
with your family than stay here,
you understand what I'm sayin'?
Mr. Hammer, please,
trust me on that one.
Hammond, Hammond, George Hammond.
- Sorry, darlin'. I'll change that one.
- I just want a bed to sleep on.
I don't have enough money to stay
in a hotel. I don't have a family.
You never married?
Handsome man like yourself.
I'm not handsome.
Maybe I was.
I was married once.
She's no longer with me.
- Breasts.
- Excuse me?
Breast. She had breast cancer.
One. Then the other one.
She's... she died. She's gone.
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.
It's alright. We had been
divorced for many years.
How about children?
You got any children?
One.
One girl.
Daughter. She know you're here?
Give her a call?
Yeah, daughters and daddy's
special relationship.
I love my daddy, sure did.
He was...
I just worshiped the ground he walked on.
He could do no wrong in my eyes.
He was a rock.
I don't know where she is.
I... haven't seen her in a while.
Anyway she doesn't want me.
She doesn't...
She wouldn't want me. She's not one
of those daughters. She doesn't...
adore me. She doesn't...
worship the ground I walk on. I...
I didn't pay much attention to her.
My mind was on somethin' else.
On somethin' else? Like what?
I'm just a fuck up. Probably always was.
Alright. So...
are you and have you been addicted
to any legal or illegal substances?
And please don't lie.
I just want a place to sleep, please.
- We will have to do a psychiatric evaluation.
- I just want a place to sleep...
I'm addicted to sleep.
And you will be evaluated
with the social history within...
I'm gettin' the idea, I don't feel like
you want me to be here. Is that true?
'Cause I'm feelin' like
you want me to go away.
- I want what's best for you.
- You want what's...
You have no idea who I am. You don't
know me. How can you possibly...
How are you gonna know
what's best for me?
Why do you think I'm asking you
all these questions?
Look, I am starving, I...
I need to sleep. I have no answers.
Put down anything you want,
I'm sure you know...
- Do you see this?
- ...all the answers to everything.
These are meal vouchers.
Okay? Now, I can give you one of these.
You get a meal,
let you back into the shelter.
Missed dinner, but you're gonna have
breakfast tomorrow at 6 a.m.
And if you're really good,
I might get you a sandwich.
- Okay.
- But I need you to answer my questions.
You willing to answer my questions?
Come on, handsome.
Answer my questions.
- What room were you assigned?
- To W... room 72.
Up the stairs, to the right.
Excuse me.
Alright, wake up.
Let's go, time to wake up.
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.
The world is not gonna help you!
God will help you! God cares about you.
No, no, no, they sent me from Bellevue.
- You got any food on you, man?
- No, no, no.
You bring any food in, you're out.
No fighting, no spilling,
no stealing and no sex.
Curfew's at 10:30.
Snooze, you lose your bed.
Out by 8 a.m.
Go upstairs.
Hey, come here.
- Hey, man, time's up.
- Sorry.
White ass, there ain't
no time limit on showers.
What are you?
You the water authority all of a sudden?
Hey, I'm sick and tired
of waiting, okay?
Yo, man, you ain't got to lie...
I don't know him. I don't know.
Mind your own business.
- What?
- It's my bed.
- No, it's not...
- It's my bed, it's my bed.
They gave it to me.
I just got here. Okay?
I'm Jack.
It's nice to meet you too.
What's the matter?
You afraid of me, newbie?
You afraid of me, newbie?
Afraid I'll take your things?
Afraid I'd fuck you up or something?
Why would I fuck with you?
No, you fuck up, you go
to next step shelter which is...
you know, last step shelter really and then
you're up shit creek without a paddle.
And they can kick you out for a year.
They can't deny you a bed
if you don't fuck up.
So you gotta learn to play their game.
That's why I play it cool.
- I know you are not sleeping.
- What the hell is this?
An Aryan nation brotherhood meeting?
They don't give a shit
who they let in these days.
Why don't you pull up your pants?
Why don't you go to hell?
- What'd he mean by that?
- I thought you were asleep.
- I am asleep. I was...
- Oh, you're asleep?
Why did he say that?
Oh, he's a fucking racist. That's why.
Stop payin' attention to him.
We got white people in this system.
More than you think.
Yeah, not more than them, but...
Yeah, there's more of us on the street.
That's the pride of the white man.
Shelters are like prisons.
You know, just a fucking rat in a cage.
This place is shit.
It's designed to be shit.
You read the Bible?
I read the Bible. "That which is crooked
cannot be made straight."
So now, here we are.
Anyway, I don't care.
I don't care. They don't have
any power over me. You know.
I gotta go to bed.
I got work in the morning.
You got a job? Work?
Yeah, I got a job.
Just because I sleep in this fucking bed
doesn't mean I'm like some
fucking lowlife scumbag
begging for change on the street.
Damn.
Just one moment.
Okay.
Now... let's see.
Can you... can you tell me something?
Is there a way to get some money here?
Oh, yeah. You get a job.
Or get on welfare
or Social Security or disability
or food stamps or...
The purpose of this evaluation is to see
what kinda services you're eligible for.
You know...
psychiatric, substance abuse...
whatever or what not.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Are you alright?
I'm lost.
You're here because I'm gonna
evaluate you so I can help you out,
so I can see what services I can get you.
How I can take care of you.
I'm sorry, one second.
Let me just take care of this. Shit.
Sorry.
Shit. Boyfriend troubles.
You know what I'm saying?
- Have a nice day...
- Have a nice day?
You have a fucked up day! You ain't
got no right to talk to me this way.
I live here! I live here
like everybody else does.
You ain't got no right to say this thing
to me. Treat me the way you do.
Act like I'm gonna rat on these boys here.
These men are my brothers.
You don't know that shit?
You don't live here with us, that's why.
If you know what to say,
you don't know shit.
- Don't matter what you say to me.
- You don't know shit.
- You gotta learn how to talk to me.
- I gotta learn how to talk...
- You got to learn to act! You hear me?
- Take care, Mr. Turner.
Take care? You got your nerve, man.
You got your goddamn nerve.
You give me some cigarette,
you think I'm gonna rat on people.
These are my people.
These are my brothers.
You sit up there, try to be like
the grand master of this here place.
You ain't shit, Mike.
What do you want? Do you want something?
You're the new guy. Dixon Turner.
- Attorney at law. I want to represent you.
- I don't have anything.
- I don't know what you want from me?
- I'm just kidding. I'm a jazz man.
You know, I'm a musician.
I play... I play good too.
- Yeah. Yeah. Where you going?
- I'm go... I'm going.
Oh, I'll walk with you. Come on.
Come on, I'll walk with you.
Done much walking
since you been reduced?
- I'm not reduced.
- Yeah, you reduced. Refined.
- Relocated. Remitted. Replaced.
- I don't know what that means. I'm not reduced.
Whatever they call homeless,
that's what you are.
- I'm not homeless either.
- Yeah, you're homeless.
What... what number are we?
What number we got?
Yeah.
Listen, listen, George,
you got any children?
I got 2 sons...
so they tell me.
Army, marines. Good boys. Good boys.
And I got a daughter...
though she didn't make it.
Human Im... Immuno...
Immuno...
You know, HIV... took her.
Baby didn't stand a chance.
And I got another daughter.
They say between 1975 and 1976.
But you know how it is being a musician
on the road makin' music.
White powder. Cocaine, heroin.
And a few other things too.
Ended up right where you thought
you'd never be but here I am.
Here I am. So, hey, hey, listen to this.
Well, do you know that every...
human male...
That's a man, like you and me.
Makes enough sperm in 2 weeks to impregnate
every ovulating woman on this planet?
That's a fact, man.
I heard it once from this doctor
I was hanging out with...
on the streets.
He was a meth head. You know, tweaker.
He worked at Harlem
and did these tests...
tuberculosis tests at the Harlem Hospital.
You know, he let them inject him...
for McDonald coupons.
Can you believe that?
But he... he dead now.
So I don't see him anymore.
He was killed by this transvestite
he was seein' on and off.
More often on, if you know
what I'm talkin' about.
A real doctor with a real MD
until he lost his license.
He was a brain... brain man.
Every 2 weeks.
Every fertile female on the planet.
You know, the only thing I do
for pleasure these days
is have myself a Coca Cola.
Coca Cola is my only...
Yeah.
Sometimes, Pepsi.
Hey, you know what,
I played for Bill Evans once.
You know who it is, don't you?
Bill Evans, jazz man.
I played for him once
about 10 blocks from here.
He said, I played okay.
Can you believe that? That's like
Michelangelo sayin', he sayin'...
he admires your paint job
on the ceilin'.
I played okay. Bill Evans.
Shit.
Damn, we're gonna be here all day.
Okay, do you have any I.D. that proves
that you're a citizen of the United States?
What? No. Not on my person.
I don't have it, no. No, I'm sorry.
It's okay. Look, can you get it
and come back?
I don't know where it is.
Alright, what's your
social security number?
Okay, okay.
- 930...
- No.
- 05...
- Sir, that's not right.
I think.
- 930?
- 9... no.
- 93005...
- It's not correct.
The first digit can't be 9, sir.
- 093?
- Oh, boy.
093051120.
I think. I... 093?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I can't.
I can't remember. I have a hard time
with numbers. I... I have...
- remembering problems sometimes...
- That's okay. It's okay, it's okay.
We need some documentation, anyway.
You must get a new social security card.
Where do I get that?
$3000 per person per month
per person staying in the shelter.
I say, Mr. Commissioner of Housing.
Mr. Housing Commissioner
give me $800 rent,
and you can spend the rest
on pussy for all I care.
Get you a lot of pussy with that kind of
money. Give me a little bit of self-respect.
That's what I want. That's all I want.
A place I can call my own.
Give me a nice place.
Give me some bleach. I'll clean it up.
I'll clean up real neat,
and respectable-like.
Have some of my musician friends
over there. Get us some jazz.
You wanna get cleaned up?
A shower?
I know this lady up in the Bronx.
Opens her apartment up, and you can take
a shower but it's gonna cost you.
The shelter's free. The choice is yours.
Would you rather go up there,
or the shelter?
You hear?
- I'm done.
- Done?
That dude missed curfew.
You miss curfew, you're fucked.
They make you sit out in hallways.
They give your bed away
to somebody else.
And your locker. It's your locker,
so you can lock it up.
But here's the thing,
you come back the next night
they make you sit in the hallway
till after midnight then maybe...
just maybe, you get a bed.
They call that packing up,
know what I mean. Packin' up.
It takes you seven days
to get your... get your locker back.
And now some of the case workers,
they really care.
They're good people,
they're trying to get us housing
but there's no housing out there
to be had so they become desensitized.
Too many of us, you know.
Too many of us.
Think about it from a taxpayer's
point of view.
We get a mattress, a bed, a locker.
Shampoo, toothpaste.
It ain't right. It ain't a square deal.
We didn't earn it.
It's a handout, not a hand-up.
- Turner, leave that man alone.
- Oh, shit.
He bothering you?
- No, not at all.
- He said no, not at all.
Go back to bed and stop
hanging out down here.
Go back to bed?
You need to kiss my ass. Go back to bed.
Treat me like some goddamned child.
You... you need to watch yourself.
You're the child around here.
Go back to your bed.
Hey. Hey.
He bothering you?
No. Not at all.
Well, if you need me, just call.
You know, you just gotta
get there really early.
You guys are just, you know,
you're not getting there early enough.
Yeah, but it's raining, you know.
I don't wanna get wet.
But it's not raining today,
which is good.
Alright, I'm gonna go. Thanks, you guys.
I'll see you later, okay.
- Yeah.
- You know...
some days, this feels heavy... you know.
You guys have a good day.
Have a good night too.
- Sheila?
- Who?
- Sheila!
- That's not my name.
Sheila! What do you mean? It's me.
- That's not my name.
- But... you're Shelia. I'm George.
- This is George. I don't know what...
- George, I don't know who the fuck you are.
- Please don't talk to me. Don't talk to me.
- I lost my friend. I lost my friend.
And then I stopped looking for him,
I didn't know anyone but you.
Wait, wait, wait wait, wait, wait.
Look, I was just gonna get some beer.
You have money?
I got enough for a six pack.
You want some?
Do I get to keep the cans?
I know how to make enough
to get through, you know.
Cannin' works for basic
daily needs, basically.
And if I'm up at 5 in the morning,
I can be done
before the midtown worker bees
even finish breakfast.
Also, cans that pile up
from the night before.
Anyone, you know. Cops, other homeless.
Teachers from Colombia.
Hasidim. No one's above it.
I started that when I was a kid.
I slept with a few guys but that was just
so I could get away from my stepdad.
Stepdad...
You know what they say, incest is best.
Not really, not really.
I... I thought I could go to Vegas...
and do something with the cards
because I was good at countin'.
Is that stupid or what?
But you know what,
I lost my taste for hooking
after Joseph beat the shit
out of me that last time
because I wouldn't let
his johns tie me up.
That's where I draw the line.
I gotta be in charge.
You gotta get along
to get along, you know?
You... your real friends
will look out for you.
On the street, that is.
I am done with the shelters. I am done.
You...
Why...
Why are you looking at me like that?
Sheila.
You awake?
That was nice.
You're insane.
Will you move? Excuse me, thank you.
Why would you just give me
those photos like that?
I didn't have
any other place to put 'em.
I'm... I'm between places right now.
- Sheila's gone.
- Don't talk. I don't wanna hear it.
Actually, I don't need to know
anything about your life.
So, what is it you want?
You want money?
Is that it? Alright, well.
Here. All I have.
- Yeah, I don't need all of it.
- What else?
You seem good. You seem pretty good.
- What else do you want because I'm busy.
- I want... how much is it...
And I don't wanna get involved in any
of your fucked up shit ever again.
I don't.
Alright. Thank you.
Just stop feeling so sorry for yourself.
I'm probably gonna move away, Dad.
Like, far away.
Then you won't be able to find me.
So, you should just say goodbye now.
Are you really moving?
Alright, whatever.
I'm busy, alright? Sorry.
Hey, fuckhead. Stop that!
Hey, fuck, I said stop that.
Hey, get the fuck outta here.
You fucking animal.
I said get the fuck outta here.
I oughta get you arrested.
That's their only objective
is to make you and I feel like...
What the fuck? Where you been, man?
Where you been? You lucky motherfucker.
You stay out all night,
and they don't give your bed away.
Like you're untouchable.
It's like there's no punishing
King George around here.
So, where you been? What did you do?
Where did you go?
Did you go dancing? That's what you did?
Oh, a fight!
- What happened to the other guy, do you know?
- They sent him to another shelter.
Lucky bastard.
Qualifies for all sorts of shit now.
I told 'em you weren't right in the head
and you needed somebody to look after you.
- You're okay with that, right?
- Yeah, I'm not right in the head.
Yeah.
You know...
I've got this cousin in Kenya.
Has a big factory there. The turbines,
cotton or some shit like that, sugar.
Said he'd give me a real cushy job.
The city says, if I sign a paper
sayin' that I wouldn't come back
to the New York shelter
they will buy me a ticket.
Send me there.
Free of charge. That's right.
You believe that?
- No, I don't...
- Buy me a ticket to go all the way there.
But I can't go.
- I can't leave Russell.
- Gentlemen, lights out. 10 minutes.
- Who's Russell?
- My dog.
- A dog?
- He's my main man.
Where is he?
I don't know.
But if you got a family
they'll take you in.
They'll fly you there. Free of charge.
It's a sweet deal thing.
They're gonna want to, you see
'cause they want you out of here.
Out of this hell hole.
I'd be in China right now
if it wasn't for Russell.
Hey, look at this. Look at me.
See that there?
See that? Can you read that?
That's the Lord's prayer.
An Aramaic. Galilean, that's the...
That's the Jesus...
- Damn!
- That's right.
Be my back, I got your back.
Now, you see that little round thing there.
That's the... that's the all-seeing eye.
See everything. I got your back.
There's nothing to worry about.
Dix is on the case.
Yeah.
You're gonna need
to bring in your birth certificate
if you wanna get a new social security card.
Okay, you're gonna have to find one.
You're gonna have to get
something equivalent to it.
Now, he does not need
a birth certificate. The man is here.
- You see him standing here. His...
- When you get your paperwork together
then please bring it back,
and I'll try to help you.
Excuse me, ma'am. I like that hair.
You got any change for me?
A dime or somethin'?
My credit card, it's all maxed out.
Yeah.
Bless you. Bless you, man.
May you prosper. May you prosper.
Excuse me... Sue, Sue, Sue.
Hey, Sue, you got some change?
No change?
Muscular dude.
Look at 'em walking there.
Like Samson. Boom, boom.
- I don't have that. I'm sorry.
- It can be anything.
- Anything like what? What...
- A driver's license?
- No.
- A state issued non-driver photo ID card?
- No.
- A passport?
- I had one once. No!
- US military photo ID card?
I wasn't in the military. No.
It can be 2 recent utility bills
with your name and address.
- I don't have an address. I'm sorry...
- Telephone? Con Ed? Cable?
He does not have a home.
At the moment, I don't have
a home, at the moment...
Then you can get a letter from a government
agency dated within the last 6 months.
Taxes, social security.
Do you think we'd be here
if he had that shit?
You need a valid photo ID
for a copy of your birth certificate.
- Okay, yeah, I understand.
- Then come back. Thank you, gentlemen.
He fell on the tracks.
He was all diced and sliced up.
You know, it was interesting
'cause he lived in the subway.
On the E train, which is small.
Because the E train stays underground.
They don't come up above ground.
$60,000 in his shoes, in his sock.
He... you don't get it.
The man didn't have to be who he was.
He wasn't a bum. He had all
the help he needed in his feet.
He didn't have to be homeless.
The disease told him he was homeless.
The disease told him
that he wasn't worth anything.
Would you say something? Anything!
Did you hear what I was just saying?
- Are you the idiot or am I?
- Am I what?
Because it's what
I've been thinking about.
- I've been feeling for the last...
- Yeah?
10 years maybe that I am...
just one stupid, fucking...
loser of an idiot.
And I'd...
- You know...
- I'm just not so sure anymore.
- Am I homeless?
- No, no, no, you just need...
- Am I homeless?
- You're reduced, on your way up, George.
I'm homeless. I don't have a home.
I got no home.
- No, no, that's not what this is about.
- I'm homeless. I'm nobody. I don't exist.
- We're reduced...
- You don't exist. We do no exist.
- What do you mean, we don't exist?
- Fucking... we don't exist.
Maybe you don't exist. I exist.
- I'm gonna prove to you that you...
- They think you're a fucking clown.
You're a clown. They think we're clowns.
We're cartoons.
- I'm a clown now?
- You and me are cartoons.
Okay, I'm... okay, I'm a cartoon.
I'm a little cartoon.
I will do some animated...
- A cartoon. I am a cartoon.
- I'm animated. I know who I am.
Alright, look at me. I am a cartoon.
Hey, hey, you okay in there?
Yeah. Oh, okay.
Hey, hey. Wash your hands.
Wash your hands.
You should be working.
You should get your own place.
But you don't. Why? Why? Why is that?
'Cause you're sick in the head.
You're not well.
You got no support system.
I mean, you... you got old,
and, you know,
you love this sauce too much.
You don't like yourself. You're depressed.
You don't believe in yourself.
So what's society supposed to do
with you? Why should they care?
- It's all your fault...
- If you keep talking like this about me
I am going to hurt you.
Do you understand that?
I will hurt you, I swear.
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about myself.
Do you guys... do you guys want something
like rice and vegetables or something.
- Yeah, thank you.
- Give me one minute, alright?
Sure thing, sure thing.
Vegans. Kindest people on the planet.
Takes a man who don't eat animals
to treat a human being right.
Sit on down. We will stay a minute.
And don't you tell those other fuckers down
in the... at the shelter about this, okay?
I... I'd play but it's out of tune.
It's just here to decorate the place.
You know, class it up, that sort of...
- I don't believe you.
- What?
- You don't believe it's out of tune?
- I don't think you can play.
- Is that so?
- No. I don't believe it at all.
So, I... I gotta play or you're gonna...
gonna hurt me like you've been saying?
Is that it? Is that... is that right?
- I'm sorry. Yeah.
- You sorry? You so...
Would you stop fucking apologizing?
I don't need you to believe nothing.
I know who I am...
- You keep talking, you just keep talking.
- I keep talking 'cause I know who I am...
No wonder nobody likes you.
- Nobody likes me?
- People don't like you. They don't like you.
No.
Oh, it's... It's almost
definitely out of tune.
- I told you.
- Yeah, it's my dad's from years ago.
- See.
- No one's played in a while. But...
if you guys... if you guys
can play, by all means.
- Tickle the ivories.
- I can play. I can play like the devil.
- I don't need to prove nothing to nobody.
- You can't play.
You Marcus Junius Brutus. You are Judas.
I am a musician.
I'm a damn good musician.
I don't hear you playing.
I don't hear it.
It's... did you hear what the man just said?
The man just said it's out of tune.
I said it's out of tune. Would you get
the damn wax out of your ear?
It's out of tune.
Think about my reputation.
How can a great jazz musician like me
play a piano that's out of tune.
Alright, okay.
Well, it's... it's all good.
Here, I made some rice.
I made some for the both of you.
I ain't giving him nothin'.
You two are like an old married
couple or something?
Yeah, I give you that.
I don't believe in gay marriage.
Or even straight marriage either.
A man should be free to have fun.
Marriage is... isn't a God-given gift.
It's a life sentence.
That's what marriage is.
Finally, finally, finally,
we got some peace and quiet here.
Alright? Okay? Give me. Can I...
Thank you.
And we lost our insurance.
I lost my job.
I fell hard, long.
I started drinking.
Home, lost that.
And then... then she died.
My... my daughter...
was 12.
At that time, Maggie was 12. She...
I couldn't...
I kind of went down the rabbit hole
that I couldn't...
So she was raised by her grandmother.
My wife's mother.
I couldn't even look at her.
I... I just felt...
I don't know, that was about 10 years
that just kinda went away.
About 10 years, I was...
My mind just wouldn't become
quiet, and then...
The noise, and then...
some lady friends...
who were incredibly...
generous, and kind, nice.
Gave me their bed, gave me their couches
and then they gave me the boot.
So, I don't know anybody anymore.
- Hey.
- Hey, man. How's it goin'?
I thought they moved you
to another shelter.
What? No, no. That jabber mouth, Dixie gave
me some dough to switch places with him.
He said the spot had good
joo joo or somethin'.
I just wanted to get him off my back.
I'm gonna stick around here.
I can't get into any trouble, you know.
- I'm gonna stay here as long as I can.
- Yeah.
Then I'm gonna go back to school
next year. You know, if benefits kick in.
Get some kinda tight job, you know.
I'm thinking tech.
- Good. Yeah.
- Alright, cool.
Three quarter housing, it's illegal.
They'll give you a tiny room,
and it stinks...
The bunk beds stacked up to the ceiling.
Come on, you know,
there's... there's a... you...
The van takes you and drops you off
at this... this place,
it's right in front
of this Chinese restaurant.
You gotta go in the basement,
climb up these stairs.
You come at this blue door,
this little blue door.
The next day, you come back to the shelter,
and what they'll do, you stand there...
- Stop it. Stop! Stop. Stop. Stop talking.
- What? What?
- What's gotten into you all of a sudden?
- Leave me alone.
Leave you al... leave you alone?
"Shh" yourself.
You gotta fight the demons. You gotta
fight those demons inside of you.
- I told you...
- You know... fuck... fuck you.
Fuck you. I'm not gonna go down
to play this game with you.
Stop talking.
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.
- And fuck you.
- No, fuck you.
No, no, fuck you. I don't give a shit
about... you feeling sorry for yourself...
Fuck you in your ass. Fuck you.
Fuck me, indeed.
You gonna apologize,
before I talk to you again.
You lettin' the demons get hold of you.
Motherfucker.
This is the beginning of the end.
Mind your own goddamn business.
Get away from my shit, man.
Don't touch my shit.
Go, go. Come on...
- You want me to pack it up for you?
- You ain't packing up shit.
I ain't going no fuckin' where.
What's wrong with you, Mike?
- I ain't got time for this.
- Do you know what time it is in the mornin'?
The... you... you stay
the fuck out of this.
- You owe me an apology.
- Lower your voice.
- Lower my voice, or what you gonna do?
- Dixie.
I know my rights. You cannot move me out here
in the middle of the night.
- I wanna talk to the director.
- You pack up this shit...
I ain't packing up shit. I ain't going
nowhere. You gonna apologize to me now?
Will you please lower your voice?
People are sleeping.
- I was sleeping too, god damn it!
- Now you gonna sleep somewhere else.
Sleep somewhere... fuck you.
Wake up. Alright, everybody up.
Everybody up. Come on, let's go.
Gentlemen, time to get up.
Frank, hey. Come on, get up.
Everybody up, guys. Come on, let's go.
Hey, good morning, George.
Hey, George. You're my 9 a.m.
Mr. Hammond, you have an appointment.
He doesn't hear me, do you think?
Mr. Hamm...
Hey.
How are you?
Doin' okay?
Yeah, people are just...
are gone sometimes.
- It doesn't make any sense.
- What do you mean?
- Do you need anything from inside?
- What do you make of the weather?
Say what?
You think it's... 32 degrees or more?
I think it's spring time.
I think it's warming up.
Yeah.
Can I use your bathroom?
Okay, yeah. I just... I just...
It was a bit of a shock.
I'm sure. I'm sure it was.
How is everything going?
Coalition is on 4.
Hello, I'm here... Someone told me...
Mr. Hammond.
Mr. Hammond, I can't help you
if you don't tell me what you need.
I'm sorry, I...
blacked out or something.
Do you need medical care?
No. I don't really need one.
I... didn't blackout, I...
daydream sometimes.
How can I help you today?
You can help me today. Oh, yeah.
Not just me.
Go ahead.
Something happened.
A friend of mine.
- Okay, what... what happened?
- He was at the... shelter.
Which one?
Do you... do you need
a glass of water or something?
Mr. Hammond.
It's okay, I need... I need
a copy of my birth certificate.
So that I can get a social
security card and get services.
Sure, okay, well...
I have no I... ID.
It's just the way it is.
I don't wanna get into it.
Sure, sure. Well, we... we can
write a letter on your behalf.
We use the Legal Aid Society.
It... it's fine.
- You can do that?
- Yeah, well, they can.
- I mean, we advocate for you.
- Really?
Yeah, yeah, we'll help you
navigate this every step of the way.
Do you have money
for the application, and...
Yeah, it's okay. We'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out.
This shelter, you'd... you said
something about your shelter.
Yeah.
I just need my birth certificate.
Are you okay... otherwise?
I mean, the shelter, you said something
happened to a friend of yours.
It's all good now.
- It's all good.
- Okay, alright, well, let's...
- Let's... let's get started.
- Yeah.
What's your full name?
Got some change, man?
You got some change?
Spare change, man? Spare change?
Spare change?
Spare change?
You've got some spare change?
Help me out. Spare change?
Help me out. Spare change?
Spare change? Spare change?
Can you help me out?
Help me out. Spare change?
Help me out, man?
Please, help me out. Spare change?
Spare change? Help me out.
- Beer, untapped...
- I'm not gonna give you any more money, so...
I'd like a beer... untapped.
- Any kind.
- It isn't cheap.
- Thank you.
- What else?
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
- Just wanna settle up.
- Yep, close it out.
- Yeah, you got the card.
- I have your account, yep.
Last name, Greyson.
I'm glad you got
the Owe Me Down, it's nice.
Yeah, it's good, right? And now we're
getting something new from the next week.
Okay.
Thanks, man.
- Alright. Thanks.
- Yup.
What do you want?
You can't just come in here and...
I'm just sitting here.
I'm just sitting...
No, I don't buy that.
I think it is something else.
So what else is it that
you owe me this occasion of...
coming in here and drinking beer?
For me?
"To whom it may concern. I write on behalf
of George Hammond, a client of the...
"Mr. Hammond is homeless, residing
temporarily at the Men's Shelter.
"He has no source of income, and as
a result we request that this application
"for emergency food stamps,
cash benefits and...
his benefits card
be processed on his behalf."
That's to... to get a copy
of my birth certificate. That's...
that's what it's for.
So...
Maggie, I just wanted to see ya.
Alright, fine, then drink your beer.
Then you have to leave. It's on me.
Can I have another one?
