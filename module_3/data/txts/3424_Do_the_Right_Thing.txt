Sonny, how's the vegetables, huh?
Good morning, Sal? Vito? Pino?

[Yawns]
Vito, get a broom
and sweep up front?
Huh?
Sweep up the front?
What?
Get a broom

See? Every time

he tells me what to do?
He's brain-dead, Pop, for years?
Both of you, shut up?
Tell Pino!
Am I talking to myself?
I didn't want to come anyway?
I hate this frigging place?
I detest it like a sickness?
You, you detest this place
like a sickness?
That's like really hate, you know?
That's hate?
I didn't say that?
Oh, you didn't say that?
I just heard it?
Am I going crazy?
Did I just hear that, Vito?
I mean, do you think
you can do better?
No, I didn't think so?
This is a respectable business,
and there's nothing wrong with that?
I mean, if there's
something wrong with that, tell me?
Is there something
wrong with that?
There's nothing wrong? OK?
Do me a favor?
Get a broom and sweep up?
Tell Vito?
What are you... deaf?
Pop asked you?

That's right?
Vito, sti cazzi.

You want brothers on the wall?
Get your own place?
You can put your brothers and uncles,

whoever you want?
But this is my pizzeria?
American-Italians
on the wall only?
Take it easy, Pop?
And you, hey, don't start

What?
Yeah, that might be fine, Sal,
but you own this?
Rarely do I see
any American-Italians eating in here?
All I see is black folks?
Since we spend much money here,
we do have some say?
You looking for trouble?

is that what you are?
Yeah, I'm a troublemaker?
I'm making trouble?
You're a ball-breaker?
You're always coming in here

Suppose I busted your head?
How would you??
Mookie, you want to get

Wait a minute?
Hold it!
I want an arrest made now!
Right now!
What's the matter?
Calm down?
Sir, tell us what happened?
Two black kids soaked me
with the fire hydrant?
They ruined my car!
It's an antique!
They got me soaked!
So where are they?
Brilliant fucking question!
They ran away!
What do you think?
Do you wish
to file a complaint, sir?
Yeah? I want 'em locked
under the fucking jail?
I'm going to turn off the water?
Where you going?
Where's he going?
Did you catch their names?
Officer, what the fuck

Just calm down?
Did you catch their names?

Moe and Joe!
Moe and Joe what, sir?
Moe and Joe what?
Moe and Joe what?
Moe and Joe Black?
How's that?
They're brothers, sir?
Brothers? Yeah,

This hydrant
better not come back on again,
or there's going to be hell to pay!
Come answer to me, god damn it!
Ask him? He knows?
He witnessed
the whole fucking thing!
Tell him what happened?
Let us do the questioning, sir?
Fucking bullshit?
Know anything about this?
Who were the punks?
Doctors, those that'll tell
don't know,
and those that know won't tell?
What the fuck is that, voodoo shit?
Hey, the Mayor don't
know nothing, all right?
Hey! He's leaving?
Keep this hydrant off?
Go swim at Coney Island?
I'm talking to you!
He's leaving?
What about me?
I suggest you get to your car
before these people
strip it clean?
Have a nice day, sir?
He left there
about a half hour ago?
No, no problem?
Thank you?
Mookie left...
Where the hell you been?
I got a business to run?
Run it then, OK?
That's for the station?
Love Daddy?
Yeah? Love Daddy?
Hey, Pop, I'm going
to go with Mookie, OK?
Yeah? You make sure
Mookie don't jerk around?
Wait up, Mook!
You ain't going anywhere?
How you doing?
Vito, I know Pino's
your brother and shit,
but you should kick his ass
the next time he touches you?
The next time he hits you,
fuck him up!
Whoa! Whoa!
Yo, hey, Mook?
I appreciate this concern,
but I don't think
it's any of your business, Mook?
Yeah, but you need
to kick his ass?
Smiley, not now?
If I had a brother like him,
we'd fight all the time?
Smiley!
Mook, you don't got
a brother like him?
Smiley, get out of here!
If you did, you wouldn't know
what to do with him?
He's my brother?
I'm not going to hit him?
I got a sister?
You never clocked your sister?
Does she bug you?
You don't hit girls
like you hit guys?
Just fuck your brother up once,
it'll be over with?
We'll be out
of this fucking conversation?
It might do some good?
Yes, all right?
A lot of good?
Let's give...
Love Daddy!
Peoples, my stomach's
been grumbling,
but help has arrived?
My main man Mookie
has saved the day!
Straight from Sal's
Famous Pizzeria up the block?
Step up to the mike, Mookie?
Come on? Come on!
Don't be shy?
Mmm, this smells good?
Go ahead?
This is your Love Daddy talking,
Starving like Marvin?
Say something?
All right, Love Daddy?
I'd like to dedicate this record

Vito's down, all right?
Yeah, right?
Vito's down?

Phew?
Yo!
Damn?
Yo!

You almost knocked me down?
The word is "excuse me?"
Excuse me?
I'm sorry?
You stepped on
my brand-new white AirJordans?
That's all you can say?
You're serious?
Yeah! I'll fuck
your prick two times!
Two times!
Who told you to be
in my neighborhood?
I own this brownstone?
Who told you to buy a brownstone
in my neighborhood?
What do you want to live
in a black neighborhood for,
anyway?
I understand this is
a free country?
A man can live
wherever he wants?
Free country?
I should fuck you up for saying that?
Yo, man?
YourJordans are fucked up!
Might as well throw them shits out?
They're broke?
They looked good
before he messed them up?
He was even talking
about your mama...
Shit, you used
to be so fine!
How much they cost?
$100!
$108 with tax?
You're lucky
I got a loving heart?
Next time, cross the street quick?
I'm out of here?
Break his feet!
You should buy me another pair!
Black Panther'd whip his ass!
You're lucky I'm
a righteous black man!
Other wise you'd be
in serious trouble! Serious!
Let's fuck him up?
Move back to Massachusetts!
I was born in Brooklyn?
- No!
- Oh!
- Man!
Get outta here!
I should send Vito
with you all the time?
Yeah? No more
90-minute deliveries
Around the corner?
I work hard like
everybody else here, OK?
You know that's true, Pino?
Vito, come here?
Come here?
What's going on
between you two?
You boyfriend and girlfriend?
What did we just talk about?
What?
What did we just talk about?
What you talking about?
Smack him?
Any smacking
around here, I'll do?
You going to listen to him
tell you to smack me,
your older brother?
Remember who you are?
Your name is Vito Frangone,
not Vito Muhammad?
OK?
I'd love for you
to stay out of my business?
Stop putting these thoughts
into my brother's head, OK?
Look, I don't play
that Muhammad shit, all right?
What Muhammad shit?
Look?? Don't fuck me, all right?
Oh, man?
Fuck, man?
I hate this place?
I hate this place?
What a waste?
What a waste?
As I was saying
before we were
so rudely interrupted
by New York City's finest...
What was you saying?
The mother fucker
wasrt saying shit?
Yeah?
Look at that?
Look at what?
It's a god damn shame?
What's a god damn shame?
Sweet DickWillie?
That's my name?
Do I have to spell it out?
Make it plain?
OK, but listen up?
I'm going to break it down?
Let it be broke?
Can you dig it?
It's dug?
Look at those Korean mother fuckers
across the street?
Bet they haven't been
off the boat a year
before they opened
their own place?
Right? It's been about a year?
A mother fucking year
off the mother fucking boat,
and they got a business
in our neighborhood?
A good business,
occupying a building
that had been boarded up
for longer than
I care to remember,
and I've been here a long time?
Yeah, a long time?
Hear, boy?
Now, for the life of me??
You know, I can't
figure this out?
Either them Korean mother fuckers
are geniuses??
Or you black asses
are just plain dumb?
fuck you?
It's got to be
because we're black?
Ain't no other explanation?
You know it's true?
They're always keeping
the black man to about shit!
Oh, oh! You mother fuckers
hold that shit down?
I'm tired of that
old excuse, that shit?
I swear, man,
I will be one happy fool
when we open
our own business
right here in our neighborhood?
I swear to God,
I'll be first to spend
what little money I got?
You mother fuckers
are always talking
that old Keith Sweat shit...
"I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna do that?"
You ain't gonna do nothing?
You're gonna sit on this corner?
When you going
to get your business?
Just like I thought?
You ain't going to do
a god damn thing?
But I'm going
to go give them Koreans
more of my money?
Out of my way?
It's Miller time, mother fuckers?
Old Moose head fuckers
telling me what to do?
Coconut, you got nerve?
You got off the boat, too?
Leave me alone?
Kung Fu, give me
one of them damn beers?
No more free beer?
No more free beer?
Don't push me, baby?
No more free beer?
Don't start no shit?
Mr? Sweet DickWillie?
Right? That's my name?
It's a mother fucking shame?
Man, ain't that a bitch?
Here, Doctor?
What's your name?
Eddie?
How old are you?
10?
What makes Sammy run?
My name is Eddie?
What makes Sammy run?
My name is Eddie Lovell?
Relax? I want you
to go to the store for me?
What'll it cost?
How would I know?
What am I buying?
Eddie, you're too smart
for your own britches?
How much doyou want
to go to the store
for the man?
50 cents?
You got a deal?
I want you to get me
a quart of beer?
Miller High Life?
Say it's for your bedridden,
old granddad?
Now, go? Go?
What is wrong with him?
He ain't got no money for nobody?
Look at this here, man?
Cut this shit out?
What makes you the Mayor
of this block?
Shit, he's self-appointed?
Leave the man alone?
Shut up!
Look, you all leave me
the hell alone?
I ain't going out
like that, man?
You walk around this block
like you own it?
For real?
You're so old,
you're like a fossil?
You're a bum?
You're an old drunk zero?
Now what do you got to say?
What you know about me?
Can't even pee straight,
nary a one of you?
What you know about anything?
Unless you...
Unless you done stood
in the door??
And listened to your
five hungry children
crying for bread,
and you can't do
anything about it?
Your woman standing there...
You can't even look
her in the eye?
Unless you done that,
you don't know my pain,
my hurt, my feelings?
You don't know shit!
Don't call me bum?
Don't call me a drunk?
You don't got the sense
God give a billy goat!
Don't call me nothing!
It's disrespectful?
Your mamas and papas
raised you better?
I hope you finished
your little soliloquy
'cause I been peeing straight
for years?
Understand what I'm saying?
And you're right?
I wouldn't stand around
listening to my children
go hungry?
I'd be getting a job,
anything to feed them?
You're right?
I don't want to know your pain?
I don't care?
You did this to yourself?
Every day I see you walk
up and down this block, inebriated?
Never sober, but that's
what D-A stands for...
Da Mayor... drunk ass?
Come on!
This mars getting me mad!
He don't get no respect!
You'll never get
respect here, boy!
I respect those
who respect themselves!
Ahmad!
Come on, man!
Tina, I know it's been four days?
I'm a working man?
I work, too,
and I seem to make time?
What do you want me
to do, huh?
Spend some time
with me and Hector!
I want you to try and make
this relationship work?
If not, I'd rather not
be bothered with your ass?
Mookie, you're too, too tired?
OK, all right, damn?
I'll be over sometime today?
You always say later!
Later when I get off work?
Bring some ice cream?
I'm burning up?
Mookie, doyou love me?
Do I love you?
Mookie, get off the phone!
Be off in a second,

Do I love you?
I dedicated a record
on Love Daddy's show to you?
So what?
How's anybody going
to call in, Mookie?
All right!
One time?
You probably wasted??
If that ain't love, you're crazy?

See you later today?

He's making us lose business?
Mookie!

How come niggers

If you see a nigger,

Stay off the phone?
Hey, Mookie?

Who's your favorite movie star?
Eddie Murphy?
Who's your favorite rock star?

You're a Prince freak?
Boss? Bruce?

Your favorite people are niggers?
It's different?
Magic, Eddie, Prince??

I mean, they're not black,
I mean...
Let me explain myself?
They're...
They're not really black?
I mean, they're black,
but not really?
They're more than black?
It's different?
It's different?
Yeah? To me,
it's different?
Deep down you wish
you were black?
Get the fuck out of here?
Go ahead, laugh?
Your hair's kinkier than mine?

And you know what they say

You know, I been listening??
And reading...

Why don't he leave me alone?
Shut up?

That's why I asked you?
We don't have money for anything?
We don't have money for anything?
I'm beat?
Daddy, you know,
I've been thinking?
Maybe we should sell this place?
Get out while we're still ahead??
And alive?
You really think you know
what's best for us, Pino?
I mean, couldn't we sell this
and open up a new one
in our own neighborhood?
There's too many pizzerias
already there?
Maybe we could try
something different?
What am I going to do?
That's all I know?
I been here 25 years?
Where am I going?
I'm sick of niggers?
It's like I come to work??
It's "Planet of the Apes?"
I don't like being around them?
They're animals?
Why you got so much anger in you?
Why? I'll tell you why?
My friends...
They laugh at me?
They laugh right in my face?
They tell me,
"Go to Bed-Stuy?
Go feed the moulies?"
Do your friends put money
in your pocket, Pino?
Food on your table?
They pay your rent,
a roof over your head?
Huh?
They're not your friends?
If they were your friends,
they wouldn't laugh at you?
Pop, what can I say?
I don't want to be here?
They don't want us here?
We should stay
in our own neighborhood,
in Bensonurst,
and niggers in theirs?
I never had no trouble
with these people?
I sat in this window??
All I see is
little kids get old?
And I seen
the old people get older?
Yeah, sure,
some of them don't like us,
but most of them do?
I mean, for chrissake, Pino,
they grew up on my food?
On my food?
I'm very proud of that?
You may think it's funny,
but I'm very proud of that?
Look, what I'm trying
to say, son, is, uh??
Sal's Famous Pizzeria
is here to stay?
I'm sorry?
I'm your father,

And??
We want black people?
Did you ask Sal?
Yeah, I asked him?
We want nobody in there,
nobody spending
good money in Sal's,
until we get black pictures
on the wall?
What good will that do?
If you tried hard,
you could direct
your energies more usefully?
You got to be down?
You ain't?
I'm down, but I'm down for something
positive in the community?

May I help you?

The whole thing?

It's very expensive?

I thought you might like these?
I guess not?
There is nothing
like the smell of fresh flowers?
Don't you agree,
Mother Sister?
Summertime...
All you can smell is the garbage?
Smell overpowers everything,
especially the soft,
sweet smell of flowers?
You don't mind,
I'll sit right here,
catch a breeze or two,
then be on my way?
Thank the Lord,
the sun is going down?
It is hot as blazes?
Yes, Jesus?
Well, guess I'll be on my way?

Sweet DickWillie?
Uh-huh?

Nobody talking about your mom's?
I ain't say nobody?

I didn't mean it like that?
You did, too?
I just wanted to know

Sweet DickWillie?
Man, it's just a name?

How'd you get the name ML?
ML stands for ML?
Now that's some stupid shit?
Hear me?
That's some stupid shit?
'Cause everybody know
why they call me
Sweet DickWillie?
You Negroes kill me?
Always holding on to??
Always talking
about your dicks?
It's too hot to fuck?
Man, you out

It ain't never too hot
or never too cold for fucking?
I had my best piece of woman
on a humid day?
Over in the projects?
Close to your woman?
Get out!
Oh, Lord, have mercy?
I better not see her
naked on pay day?
Piraguero!
Everybody out!
The ice, ice man is here?
Hey hey!

[Ice Cream Truck
Music Chimes]
Hey, hey!
Where's everybody going?
Ice cream!
Ice cream!
Doctor!
Doctor, don't you
know no better
than to run out
in front of a car?
You trying to kill yourself?
Come on?
Let's get up?
You gonna be all right?
You gonna be all right, my boy?
You gonna be just fine?
Eddie, what's wrong?
Mayor knocked me down?
You ought to be
shamed of yourself?
Ha ha? That boy's
just scared to death?
What happened...
I was walking,
minding my business?
I seen your son
about to get hit by the car,
so I dashed out?
I knocked him down
to keep us both
from getting hit?
I saved two lives today...
his and mine?
Eddie, is that the truth?
Eddie, you hear me
talking to you?
I'm talking to you, boy?
He gonna be fine, miss?
Mommy, Mommy!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Get upstairs now!
Your father gonna
wear out your behind?
Miss, you didn't have
to hit your boy like that?
He's already scared to death?
I appreciate you
helping my Eddie,
but I'll have nobody question
how I raise him?
You're right, miss?
You're right?
I don't want to sound like a jerk,
but can I say something, Jade?
Yeah, Sal?
You got the biggest eyes
I've ever seen?
They jump out of your head?
I feel embarrassed
even saying that?
Thanks, Sal?
Don't even mention it?
It was delicious?
I got to talk to you?
I got to talk to you?
Come on?
Let's go?
Jade, don't forget
to come back soon, OK?
Hey, Mookie?
Take it easy?
You're going to bust her arm?
I don't want you
in Sal's no more?
Mookie, what?
Stop tripping?
Read my lips?
Don't see Sal?
What are you worked up about?
The way Sal looks at you?
- He's being nice?
- Nice?
- He's completely innocent?
- Innocent?
You heard me?
Sal just wants
to hide the salami?
You're really crude, Mookie?
Do not come in Sal's anymore?
You are not welcome?
You got a lot of nerve?
I'll tell you one last time?
Stop playing
big brother to me?
I'm a grown woman!
You can't pay your rent,
and you're lecturing me?
That makes no sense?
Oh, it doesn't, huh?
You got $250 a week?
I'm getting paid?
Peanuts?
In a while,
I'll be making a move?
Yeah, when?
Don't worry?
When, Mookie?
Don't worry about it?
Don't come here no more?
We're not talking about that?
I'm tired of supporting
a grown woman, OK?
I'm tired of supporting
a grown man, OK?
When are you going
to pack up and go?
Don't come in Sal's no more?
And no more pizza, either?
I don't care if you fire me
this exact fucking moment?
If you're saying
what I'm thinking
you're saying,
you better not say it?
You hear this?
Do me a favor?
LeaveJade alone?
You know, Mookie,
not for nothing,
but if you were
just a little taller,
I'd kick your ass
for what you're thinking?
As a matter of fact,
I should kick your ass
on principle alone?
Here?
You got a delivery?
This the right address?
What is this??
Yeah? It's the right address?
That's the right address?
I wrote it myself?
Sometimes you make mistakes,
and I deliver fucking pizzas
to the wrong fucking address?
I don't make mistakes?
You don't make mistakes?
Hurry back, OK?
Don't get lost?
We're still open?
Make a pizza, huh?
Mr? Mayor?
I saw what you did?
That was foolish but brave?
That child owes you his life?
Was't trying to be a hero?
I just seen what was happening,
and I reacted... didn't even think?
Probably wouldn't have done it
if I had thought?
Da Mayor's getting old?
Ain't run like that in years?
Went from first to home
on a bunt single?
Scored the winning run?
Two outs?
Bottom of the ninth?
August 1, 1939?
Snow Hill, Alabama?
Mud Cat Bones
was the pitcher?
He hated my guts?
He come down off that mound,
and I took off
like white lightning
up a black snake's ass?
Maybe I, uh??
Maybe I ought to be
a hero more often?
Maybe you shouldn't?
Don't get happy?
This changes nothing
between you and me?
You did a good thing?
Mother Sister just thanks you?
I want to thank you?
You're welcome?
Delivery from
Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Is it hot?
I've never delivered a cold pizza?
Come here?
You think you're slick, Tina?
How else could
I get you up here?
I haven't seen you all week?
I'm working?
Making money?
You forgot the ice cream again?
I forgot?
Your memory's getting ridiculous?
I got things on my mind?
I really wanted some ice cream?
I'll run out and get some?
No, no? That's out?
You won't come back?
I can't be staying long?
How long?
Long enough to do the nasty?
Come on, Mookie?
That's out?
First of all, it's too hot?
If you think
I'll let you get some,
put your clothes on and leave,
and I won't see you again,
you're bugging?
I'll see you tomorrow?
Yeah, right?
So no nasty, huh?
No?
Something else?
What?
Trust me?
Last time I trusted you,
we got a son?
Remember him?
His name's Hector?
You saying I'm a bad father?
On the strength?
Let me talk to you?
What? What?
Over here?
Tina, take your clothes off?
I already told you
it's too fucking hot
to make love?
It's too fucking hot?
Why are you always cursing?
I don't fucking curse that much?
What the hell you mean?
All you do is curse?
Anyway, no rawness
is jumping off tonight?
All right?
That's it?
No rawness?
No? No rawness?
Why's it always like that
when you come over?
It's not always like that?
It's always...
What are you doing?
I'm not cursing?
Mookie? Come on?
I mean it?
I'm not playing?
I'm not playing?
Don't be so anxious?
That's right?
Take it off?
You're sweating?
Of course I'm sweating?
It's only 100 degrees in here?
Look, freeze?
Don't move?
I'll be right back?
What do you mean
you'll be right back?
Where are you going?
I'll be right back?
Why you got me
standing on the bed?
Where you going?
How's my son, Hector?
Honey, do you hear that?
He wants to know
How you are doing?
And he has the straight face
of asking about it?
Sinverguenza.
Good for nothing?
Callejero.
Que se la pasa por la calle... -
English! English!
I want my son speaking English?
Get out of my kitchen?
Bad enough his name's Hector?
Get out of my kitchen?
I don't want to hear anything?
Out, I said?
Yes, children?
This is the cool-out corner?
We're slowing it down
for all the lovers in the house?
I'll be giving you
all the help you need?
Musically, that is?
This shit is cold?
Supposed to be cold?
It's an ice cube?
Later for your shit?
Mira.
Mira.
What?
You don't got a forehead?
You got a eight-head?
Mookie, you're full of shit?
You got one of them
Sade foreheads?

Big-ass forehead?
I need an iceberg??
Rather than this ice cube?
Thank God for lips?
Thank God for the neck?
Thank God for kneecaps?
Thank God for elbows?
Thank God for thighs?
Thank God
for the right nipple?
Thank God
for the left nipple?
Feels good?
Ah? You likes?

Oops? I got to be back then?

Bye?

Get out of here?
All right? Later?
Later?
Just out of curiosity,
how long you

You mean tonight?
I mean the neighborhood?
I figure about 50 years?
'Cause I'm going into real estate?
I'll put up a high-rise
in the neighborhood?
Yeah? Lot of people
want to move here?
Why not?
You want a condominium?
A couple of straws, Mr? Trump?
Trump's Pizza?
I heard of that?
That's Trump's Plaza?
Get out of here?
Take care, Salvatore?
Pino, take the soft drinks
from the back
and load up here?
OK, Pop?
You want me to deliver faster,
I need a rocket?? Something?
I can't be running?
The cheese lands on one side?
Mookie, I didn't say nothing?
You must have a guilty conscience?
I'm not guilty of anything?
You're guilty of something?
Other wise you wouldn't be saying that?
Come on, Sal?
Where we going?
Oh, shit?
Vito, give me a hand?
Come on?

and you don't
give a shit about your son?
I care about you and my son?
Why don't you be a man?
I am a man?
Then act like a man?
Why don't you be
a fucking man, Mookie?
I'm so tired of your shit?
Why do we have to
go over this again?
Because you don't
fucking listen, Mookie!
If you listen to me,
I wouldn't have to repeat myself
like a fucking radio!
What kind of mother you are
using fucking language like that?
What kind of mother am I?
Your ass isn't even here!
Get another vocabulary, right?
Get a fucking life?
Yeah? Look??
Lookwhat?
I'll be back?
Don't leave, Mookie?
Don't leave?
I'm tired of this shit?
You walk out that door, that's it?
All right?
I have to get my money from Sal?
I'll be back?
Your shit's to the curb,
and I'm tired ofit?
You need to step off
with your stupid-ass self?
You need to get
a fucking life, Mookie,
because the one you got
is not working!
I ain't going to deal
with this shit no more!
Shit?
Fucking ass, stupid ass,
fucking pendejo.
Shit? Fuck?
Fucking shit?
Good morning?
Is it a good morning?
Yes, indeed?
You almost got yourself
killed last night?
I've done that before?
Where did you sleep?
I didn't?
I hope the block is still standing?
We're still standing?
What do you want?
I want my money?
I want to get paid?
You don't work here no more?
I want my money?
Your money couldn't begin to pay
for the window you broke?
Mother fuck a window?
Radio Raheem is dead?
I know he's dead?
I was here, remember?
He's dead because of his buddy?
That cocksucker started this shit?
He's responsible
for that kid's death?
He wanted to close me,
and you stood there like a fuck
and watched them
burn me down!
I also watched the cops
murder Radio Raheem?
You'll get it all
from the insurance anyway, Sal?
What the fuck's
wrong with you?
This ain't about money?
I could give a fuck
about money?
You see this place?
I built this fucking place!
With my bare fucking hands!
Every light socket,
every piece of tile?
Me! With these fucking hands!
You know what that means?
It means pay me
my mother fucking money?
That's what it means, Sal?
OK, Mookie?
How much do I owe you?
My salary is 250?
250 a week?
1??
That's 2??
That's 3??
That's 4??
And that's 5?
You got $500?
You're a rich fucking man?
Are you happy?
You happy?
He's got 500 fucking dollars!
He's a big man!
He's a rich fucking man!
He's never going to have
any more trouble!
Not Mookie!
He's fucking rich!
Who the fuck you yelling at?
You're wealthy, Mookie?
You're a real fucking Rockefeller?
You got your fucking pay?
Now leave me alone?
Sal, my salary's 250 a week,
all right?
I owe you 50 bucks?
Keep it?
You keep it?
You keep it?
You keep it?
No, you keep it?
You keep it?
I don't believe this shit?
Believe it?
Are you sick?
I'm hot as a mother fucker?
I'm all right, though?
Well, they say it's even going
to get hotter today?
What are you going
to do with yourself?
Make that money?
Get paid?
Sal, I got to go see my son
if it's all right with you?
Hey, Mook.
It's the Mook man.
I see you walking.
Go home to your kid.
Now the news and weather.
Our mayor has commissioned
a blue-ribbon panel...
"to get to the bottom
oflast night's disturbance.
The City ofNew York
will not let property
be destroyed by anyone."
His Honor plans to visit
our block today.
He should hook up
with our own Da Mayor,
buy him a beer.
Your Love Daddy
says register to vote.
The election is coming up.
There 's no end in sight
from this heat wave,
so today,
the cash money word is chill.
That's right. C-h-i-l-I.
When you hear "chill,"
call in at 555-L OVE,
and you'll win
cash money, honey.
This is Mister Seńor Love Daddy
coming at you from
what's last on your dial
but first in your hearts,
and that's
the quintessential truth, Ruth.
The next record goes out
to Radio Raheem.
We love you, brother.
# From the heart ofBed-Stuy #
# W-e-L -o-v-e ##
# I was looking through
a window at my life today #
# And for the first time #
# I saw things in a different way #
# I n the middle of my mind #
# It was there all the time #
# Never explain love #
# It's not like anything
you've ever done #
# lf it is there,
it's yours to keep #
# And the boundaries, they grow deep #
# Never explain love #
# Let the experience take over you #
# And when you do #
# Never explain love #
# I was looking for an answer #
# And I was searching for a sign #
#To try and understand
this relationship of mine #
# But I didn't need to go far #
# I was reading it all wrong #
# Never explain love #
# It's not like anything
you've ever done #
# lf it is there, it's yours to keep #
# And the boundaries, they grow deep #
# Never explain love #
# Let the experience take over you #
# And when you do #
# Never explain love #
# Before I knew #
# I almost knew it all #
#Who needs to be rational #
#When love isn't practical #
# Oh, I knew this was inside #
# And it's so wrong #
# It's so right #
#Whoa-oh-ho ahh #
# Never explain love #
# It's not like anything
you've ever done #
# lf it is there,
it's yours to keep #
# And the boundaries, they grow deep #
# Never explain love #
# Let the experience take over you #
# And when you do #
# Never explain love #
# Never explain love #
# It's not like anything
you've ever done #
# If it is there, it's yours to keep #
# And the boundaries, they grow deep #
# Never explain love #
# Let the experience take over you #
# For when you do #
#Yeah, yeah #
# Never explain love #
# Never explain love ##
