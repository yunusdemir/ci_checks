Something to help out.

No, you don't get to do that.
You don't get to shoot my
husband in cold blood...
and did stuff with the ATM.
It's for your daughter.
This is what you deserve.
What you did to me.
Who punishes you?
He taught you how to shoot.
Good edge to keep
his family safe.
He could always be here.
Took the act to the range.
Showed you what to do.
This... is what you do.
Squeeze.
Now pull.
I can't find my red pen.
Mom? I need it.
Take it.
The Sebous.
Nice brother.

What's the matter?
Just when I think I'm Ok
and see my reflection...
I look horrible.
What has he done to me?
Oh no... don't cry, brother.
Everything is
gonna be alright.
I promise you two things.
One, I will find Castle
and I will kill him.
Slowly and painfully.
And two, you will never ever have
to look at your reflection again,
as long as you're with me.
Such a delineate.
9 trillion of renew
anymore crystal.
We don't talk them play.
It's the Russian, Mr. Volage.
My men is concerned.
If Punisher can do
this to your face,
what might he do to our deal?
The tongue stretches further
than most people think.
Ask your men how he's
gonna talk that shit,
when I pull it from his mouth.
Or you'll what?
Enough!
The Punisher's my problem.
Rock's mine.
My look have nothing
to do with this.
Everybody.
From local security to
international custom's in my pocket.
Quite frankly. This job
doesn't get done without me.
What's most for the blame?
It's too precise. And
she wants you have it.
Sure thing now.
Shit!
I'll go inside.
My most sincere apologies.
My father always say
never insult your host.
Sounds like a reasonable man.
You don't know my father.
Three days.
There have to be 12 million.
Maybe when you get it
all done, we'll both know,
that this biological shit you're
bringing in is ruining the city.
You're selling it to
the rednecks and queens.
The porchers are crawling
in suits from homeland.
And it take a lot of
pills to keep it quiet.
I always knew you'd
be a good boss, Billy
Latin kings.
Let him go, Frank.
You know this piece of shit?
Next piece of shit.
- Yeah.
The regular hard boy.
Fuck you, cracker.
- Language.
It's a genius racket.
You know how the cops
always run the guns by back?
Except they never work.
Because work banner is
gonna trust the cops, right?
Well, these drive by whack
jobs, they just love Carlos here.
That with one look at that Ink,
and they know he's for real.
We can get the guns
of the streets to you
Everyone seen a banger look
to quit. Too fucking stupid.
He's straight, Frank.
Hey ma! Frank's
here. He says eat up.
How is she doing?
Yeah well...
As long as she got her
cooking shows, she's good.
It's the only
thing she notices.
But hey that's
something, right?
Listen. I-
I just came around to tell you
I'm going out of town for a while.
Out of town?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I never thought of the Punisher,
you know taking a long weekend.
I'm not planning
on coming back.
So I take the things didn't go
so well at the Donatelli home.
Did the Billy
Russoli survived?
I heard.
But the cops did caught him.
You might know they
got nothing on him.
Their hands are tied.
This is when the
Punisher comes in.
This is why I believe in you. Why
I supported you all these years.
You want me to tell you about
somethings happened to...
Mrs. Donatelli
and her daughter?
Because that's
what's gonna happen.
You don't think he's
gonna go for revenge?
It's not important it's
just a matter of when.
Pull a couple of brisk.
- For what?
3, 2, 1
Russoli is the last one.
Then I'm done.
For your own lips to Ganzier.
You know where I can find him.
I don't have a fix on him.
You worked out all the
associates that amount to me.
So much to the new guy.
The leader was black.
Dreadlocks.
There's some kind of
acrobatic stuff over the roof.
That's the DNA
servant free for gain.
He's a mean motherfucker.
He's on a constant method.
Welcome home.
You want to find
the sky or not?
You boys playing with us?
I've been looking for you.
Sure yes. Take your load off.
I need to go see Castle.
Where do I find him?
- Brats, you know.
He just left.
Wait...
You know what I like to do.
I like to sit in my car and listen
to CB Radio and follow the crime.
I don't mind just indoor.
But there's no work
for me in front of this.
But I'm not the luckiest
guy in the planet, you know.
Let's get to the back door.
I didn't knew these boys are gonna
hit the store of 15th in 40 seconds.
Suspects are armed
and dangerous.
I repeat. Suspects are
armed and dangerous.
Let's do this.
Really?
Let's try the car.
Come on! Run!
Don't kill me.
Russoli, where is he?
Yeah Jigsaw, I
was just with him.
He was suppose to give
us some dope for a joke.
But time's up.
He don't come here anymore.
He forgot he have Porch do
that or he'd be like bastard.
So you wanna go see him,
you need to tell him this,
we hate you bitch.
Take your part.
Soul for soul,
Mr. Punisher, sir.
So when did Donatelli
ordered a hunt?
We were partners in that cart.
Unfortunately,
most of them had
been confiscated.
Ended up in my mouth.
Until the traders tried
to wrap me and Nicky out.
He wouldn't.
They sent him undercover.
He's dead because of me.
So you still skin your lobes?
No. That's in the past.
Shit!
I'm on the grab. Meet
me on the other side.
Move.
Hello, Mrs. Donatelli.
We will live in your
place from now on.
What do you want from us?
Looking for my money.
About the rat your
husband stole from me.
But we don't have
it. I swear to God.
How about you, sweet cheeks?
Would you also dare to swear
on your imaginery friend?
Make sure they don't move.
I'll look for the money.
- Come here kid.
Freeze, asshole.
You're under arrest.
Stay out of my way.
Listen to me.
Russoli is headed to
the Donatelli house.
He's probably already there.
You'll have to let me go.
You have the right
to shut the fuck up.
Good evening, officers.
Is everything Ok in there?
No. Everything is
not Ok. Follow me.
Officer.
No... don't!
Well...
This day was about to come
sooner or later, wasn't it?
Did you hear from
the patrol car?
So...
I tried it a couple times.
There was no answer.
Listen.
We gotta get out of here
before more pigs arrive.
Where the fuck is the money?
My husband has a safe
upstairs in the bedroom.
I don't know if it's there but
I can give you the combination.
10-12-1965
Oh how cute.
Is that your dead
husband's birthday?
Let me out of here.
Get him to the station.
- You bet.
Let me out.
You know, Frank.
You're throwing your tip
to no one against one thing.
Password to the crime base is
sure but letting you go, so-
Fine.
How you doing?
19.
What was that?
Go check it out.
What the fuck you
waiting for? Christmas?
Now.
Hey!
- You sit down.
I'm calling this out.
Put your hands behind you.
You asshole!
Where do you
think you're going?
Hands up!
I repeat, dispatch.
We need back up.
Billy! Go get him.
Get him the fucking out.
Stay where you fucking are.
We did it.
You mind explain it to me?
How I have the criminal escaped
from the back of your lock?
The case was a slippery one.
You'll be safe here.
We can manage on our own.
Just until you know
Russoli's been arrested.
Grace.
Grace, you listen, honey.
She's smart.
Go ahead. Open it.
It... belongs to my daughter.
Here.
Wow!
Was... This was
her favorite toy.
She got so angry when her
brother used to hide it from her.
Does she care to
fight with him?
No.
You gonna file for
killing two of my officers.
I wanna warn you.
- Go get your fucking line up.
No lie is gonna get
you out of this one.
Like a piece of shit.
Agent Miller. What
are you doing here?
Russoli.
What's he gotta
do with the bureau?
Pierre's gonna tell you
what he's working on.
He says he got some
intel to make a deal for.
Anyone know where
he is right now?
He's on his way
to the reservation.
Good.
Yeah.
Cameraz. Agent Miller
with the bureau.
I believe you've been informed
we're taking over this.
This perk killed
all my officers.
And terrorize a woman and
child with your agents.
You keep that in mind, Miller.
You're lucky I came
to you with this.
But then I look
patriot just like you.
I shit in red white and blue.
The reason you came to me
is because you got caught.
Say that to someone without
the intelligence, Ok?
You tell me what you know.
If it's any good,
I'll recommend
life without parole.
This deal is
going down tonight?
I know when and I know where.
So you're gonna give me and my
brother the immunity and the money.
Or you're gonna have to explain
the war to fucking Witzer.
Why you had a lead on the thing
that killed half of the fucking city,
and you didn't do a
goddamn thing about it.
I'll be right back.
Oh and Miller.
Just that one
other little thing.
Happy?
Shit! You bastard.
You're a fucking dead man.
My father will kill you.
My father said you'll hear
the fucking silver plate!
Agent Miller.
It's agreed.
The other conditions
of our agreement?
Clear the air.
I hope when the guy finds you,
you'll get what you deserve.
How long was I-
A long time.
You should eat.
Yuck!
- Grace.
What is it?
Egg and cheese and Oris.
That's all I have.
What's the name Oris?
Meal. Ready to eat.
Military food.
It's great for
people who can't cook.
Look, Grace. This is
gonna come with chuckles.
It's the best one I get.
Not exactly a
balanced breakfast.
Out of practise.
Not one more step.
Where's my girl?
His mother is in
the feeding room.
He didn't want to leave her.
Damn it.
I need to talk to her.
This is Carlos.
He's... a friend of mine.
He's gonna help me take
care of some things.
Hi Carlos. I'm Grace.
Hey little darling.
We're gonna be homies, right?
Yeah. we're gonna be tidy.
This all will be over soon.
Then you can go.
Don't go.
I need you on alert.
Don't make me regret this.
That was fun.
Now let's go kill Castle
and his miserable whore.
No, not yet.
We're gonna have ourself
a little fun with this.
Next time you guys defend
source in the fucking army.
Where do we get the army from?
Just like golden Sam, bro.
We recruit in
trouble blade boys.
Offer a hundred grand towards a
college education you'll never get.
Promise nobody's gonna
be asked to go to Iraq.
Just as long as I
get to kill Castle.
Don't worry brother. You will.
Just making damn sure this time
he don't come back breathing.
Hold it.
Hello swordsman.
How are you today my friend?
Run! Get out of here!
Hey! I asked you a question.
Wrong answer.
Guess I'll have
to ask it again.
Here I come.
Good.
Bring him upstairs.
Bring him back down here.
I'll see if we can talk these
bastards into signing up.
Where are they?
I shout. I swear I shout.
Goddamnit! Don't die on me.
What do we do now?
I see him shooting for her.
Shut up kid. You're
gonna be fine.
The hurt is real bad.
Hurt is real bad, Frank.
Don't let me die on this, man.
Not like this.
See you in hell.
I see you anywhere near
hell, I'll kick your ass up.
I haven't seen
you in ages, Frank.
Whatever it is, it
must be pretty bad.
Maybe I'm just here
to see an old friend.
Yeah right. I haven't
seen you since-
A few month ago. I know.
I've been reading about you.
You've been a long way from
the seminary, my friend.
I don't really remember
that part as in my life.
Why do you do this?
Somebody has to
punish the corrupt.
For the same way you judge
others, you will be judge.
And with the measure you use
here will be measured to you.
Matthew. 72.
I'm Ok with that.
God be with you, friend.
Sometimes I'd like to
get my hands on God.
Interested trust
for me to place.
Didn't take you for a
religious man, Castle.
Yeah well. An eye for an eye.
If I remember then I'll call
to attend your suggestions.
Besides he's got
Angela and Grace.
Doesn't matter.
Or maybe if you put her in
protective custody like you should,
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.
A locking touch, Castle.
Told you in community.
Unless you gotta take
Russoli as you take him.
Can't even give him
a parking ticket.
It's a fucked up
system you're sworn to.
I never said it was perfect.
It was being
exchanged for that.
I need to secure the trade.
Ok.
I'm on this private poke.
Where do you think
they're going by huh?
I took them host, Castle.
We're lost.
- No official police procedure.
You wanna come along?
Leave your badge at home.
I have to think about it.
Throughout this ticket.
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Relax.
We're looking for
a few good man.
And we'd like to offer
you the opportunity...
to be all that you can be.
Now we've all suffered, lost,
at the hands of the Punisher.
And because we don't
look like everybody else;
and because we don't
act like everybody else;
nobody does a goddamn
thing about it.
Well I say, he ain't the only one who
can take the war into his own hands.
So if you're as sick of
this cocksucker as I am,
raise your armies.
You'll be well paid.
You'll be well armed.
And at the end of it,
the Punisher will be dead.
Hey it's the booty ansky.
Just in time for happy hour.
You need to come with me.
Where to?
Your partner, Frank Castle.
He needs help.
Partner is a little
bit exaggeration there.
How did you know?
Usually I'm the
arresting indeed.
And no one could
escape that easily.
