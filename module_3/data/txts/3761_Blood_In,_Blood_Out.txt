So what's the difference
between East L.A. and L.A.?
It's a whole different country.
Hope it works out better
for you here than in Vegas.
It's got to. It's home.
You're not gonna get anything
like this in Las Vegas.
You got that right. I been dreamin'
about these for 18 months.
Eighteen months.
Say hello to your mother.
And stay out of trouble.
Hey! Hey!
Jesse! I'm gonna need a trim, homes.
Miklo, tell those wetbacks to step
on it, or they ain't gonna get paid.
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard you!
Get their asses movin'.
I got two more trucks on the way.
I'm already humpin',
and you ordered too much.
That's 1,500 bucks worth of mud.
Now you tell 'em to get it down,
or they can pay for it.
Your mistake. Tell 'em yourself.
Don't ever take the side of a Mexican
over your father.Just tell 'em!
Fuck you!
You ungrateful little punk!
I'm the one that kept you out of jail!
You love 'em so much,
get a broom and you can get
the same thing they're gettin' paid.
- And I'll get a man to run this crew!
- You son of a bitch!
Find yourself another slave, Dad!
I wish I could have seen
your father's face.
You beat him up.
Don't worry, Mama.
He ain't never gonna touch you again.
- Not after what I done.
- I know that cabrón.
He'll turn you in.
Miklo, come. Help me. Do me up.
I need that money.
Whoo, baby. Cold hands.
Just six little days?
Bingo! I'm home free.
June 28th. My birthday, remember?
I'll be off probation.
A birthday. Ooh, 1 8.
But to me you're always
gonna be my little chavalito, huh?
Oy,e, I'm late.
Beto hates to wait.
Hey, Miklo. You can stay with your Aunt
Dolores, huh? Come on. We'll drop you.
Dolores?
Dolores!
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Ay,, Paco! Paco, ven aquí...
You're so tall.
- How long are you here?
- Uh, I'm back for good.
- Your probation is over?
- No, no. Um, he's got
a birthday coming up.
Look, um, I gotta go.
Dolores, Miklo's gonna stay
with you for a while, okay?
- Why?
- Because you have so much more room.
I love you, nino, huh?
Lupe, you may be my sister, but I'm
tired of taking care of you! Grow up!
Look! I have tried
to be like you! I can't!
- Your life would drive me crazy!
- What about your son?
- The Pillsbury doughboy's back in town.
- Back for good, homes.
What's happening, man?
Thought you was never comin' back, eh?
So what's up? You couldn't hang
with your white boy daddy or what?
Paco, uh, Miklo's gonna be staying with
us for a while, huh? Make room for him.
Chale, ain't no one sharing
my bed and TV but a woman.
- This puto's stayin' in the garage, eh?
- Oh, yeah?
Pues, sabes qué, Mr Chale.
You're not the rooster here, huh?
This is my house.
Miklo's your cousin.
Take this electric bill
over to Mano and tell him
it has to be paid this afternoon.
Better keep the blankets
over your head, pendejo...
so your fluorescent skin
don't keep me awake all night.
-Come on.
-Hey, check out this fucking "3 P," ese.
Since when do we let Tres Puntos
get away with that shit, homes?
Big badass vato.
3 P ain't nothin' but a bunch...
of fuckin' paint sniffers
who sneak in here at night.
- They ain't about shit, ese.
- They are shit, ese.
So why the fuck do you come
all the way back here, eh?
Fuck you.
I'm gonna kick your ass, milkweed.
Come on,Jolly Green Giant!
I'm gonna kick your ass, milkweed!
You better run, white boy!
This is Quetzalcoatl,
the great Aztec poet king.
He ruled the kingdom of Aztlán...
that was from Mexico
all the way up here to Califas.
- Sexy mamasota.
- Pay attention, pelao.
I'm gonna teach you
all about Aztlán...
'cause this vato's coming back some day
to reclaim the raza's kingdom.
- Why do you put my initials on?
- Because you help me, ese.
We did it together, carnalito.
- Hey, Paco, what's up, homes?
- Chale, ese, you can't sneak up on us.
Not with Luis's
feathered watchdogs on duty.
Oy,e, El Gallo Negro

My mom wants you to pay that.
When you gonna pay your share?
Chale, I'm on the KMart
pay-as-you-can plan, eh?
You done anything
about the Corps?
I talked to the recruiter Bentley.
He's waiting for you.
And take orders
from a jarhead like you?
Forget it.
I ain't with that party.
You eat and you sleep in my house,
and as long as you do...
don't you talk to me like that!
I wanna stay with Cruz.
- Have you done your homework?
- Yeah.
In the truck.
Hey, take it easy on Mano, homes.
He just wants you to work.
Hey, he's your dad, not mine.
Let him tell you what to do, eh?
I'm just telling you, ese.
You don't have to mad-dog me.
So does that ranfla
burn or what, eh?
Chale, it's a customer's ride, man.
We can't use it.
That's bullshit.
Where do you want to go, Vegas vato?
That tree is East Los to me.
It's good to be home.

You're the best.

your quills and inks?
All right. Get down,James Brown.
Put the needle in, huh?
I want my VL tattoo.
Hey, take a look in the mirror, güero.
Does it snow in L.A.?
Does a white boy get a VL placazo?
No, he don't.
I'd have my placa now if the judge
hadn't thrown me out of East Los.
Chale, you wouldn't
have shit, milkweed.
It's some serious shit, homes.
It don't wash off.
First sign of trouble,
you'll be running back to
your white boy daddy in Las Vegas.
Oy,e, Miklo.

I can't play the accordion.
- Hope I can still paint, carnal.
- You will, carnal, you will.
A fuckin' marine, ese.
Yeah, it was either this
or jail, right?
But after boot camp, I ain't
so sure it was such a good deal.
A lot better than Miklo, homes.
Pobre milkweed.
- Boys, we just won on the Raiders game.
- Way to go!
I need my gym shoes, man!
Wanna buy some cigarettes?
What's happenin'? How are you?
- Hey, baby.
- Hola, pretty.
- Are you blond all over?
- Get your hands off me, faggot!
Ooh, how his blue eyes just light
right up when he get mad.
Leave me alone, man!
I'll kill you, bitch!
Oh! You will?
Where the fuck you get that placa,
Little Bo Peep?
You're on the clock, bitch,
and midnight is comin'.
You got the wrong man.
Oh, he's hot!
- Miklo Velka.
- Soy, Popeye.
There's some vatos you should meet.
Most of these cons don't clique.
It's the gangs
that run this place.
- What you got?
- See that black dude
with the comb over there?
the Black Guerilla Army.
Don't take nothin' from him,
or you'll end up...
with that Black Power comb
through your heart.
Those polar bears over
in the corner, that's Aryan Vanguard.
The AV-ers. Those white boys
control the dope trade...
do freelance killings,
anything for the right price.
Hey, why not
take it out in trade?
You bet cash, you lose cash,
you pay cash, pimpmobile.
Soon, or I'll have to hire
Red Ryder here and his AV boys...
to cut some fat off
that tongue of yours!
Or maybe you'd like to swap for
some of that tender white meat.
You can pay your bets with that.
Suave, Al.
I'll pay you what I owe,
but don't try scaring me...
with your AV insurance
policy 'cause remember...
I got a policy with Ryder too.
He knows better than
to mess with a good customer.
Since business is so good, I suppose
I'm gonna have to raise the rents...
on both you lame-ass fucks!
Fuck him.
Ya estuvo, Beto. It's over.
Why the fuck you let these putos
disrespect you like that for, ese?
- Hey, you take it easy, carnal.
- You're wrecking it
for the rest of the homeboys.
Hey, I'm just showing
this homeboy around, okay?
It's Miklo, from el barrio.
You're the sucker
that dusted Spider?
Well, if a rep is what
you're lookin' for, killer...
then I'm the man you want.
Tres Puntos like Spider.
- Ooh, I'm the bogeyman!
- He pissed in his pants.
Come on, carnal.
Get the fuck outta here
before I make you my bitch.
- He's Tres Puntos, ese.
- Hey!
That's street bullshit, ese.
It's different in the joint.
We clique together for power,
to protect ourselves.
So Tres Puntos or anybody strong enough
to stand with La Onda is okay.
- What's La Onda?
- Some questions you don't ask.
- Got some smokes for you.
- I don't even smoke cigarettes.
In the pinta, that's like cash.
Got a little something else.
Some juju weed.
Yeah, I smoke that now, vato.
Hey, you don't mind if I keep you under
my wing for a little while, you know.
- I mean, I gotta take care of you, huh?
- Okay, vato.
- Hey, we homeboys, right?
- Fuckin' A. East Los rules, vato.
Gracias, carnal, okay?
- All right, you white bitch.
Gimme some chon-chon!
- Stay away from me.
You get nothing
for free in here, punk.
- Ah?
- Okay.
Ah? That's right,
give it up. Oh, shit!
You want me to take it, huh?
You want me to rape you,
eh, puto? Huh?
Let's see the colour
of your blood, gabacho.
I'm gonna cut that fucking placa
off of you.
You ain't no Vato Loco!
Huh?
Está bien, Montana.
Keep your business off this tier.
Ese, Pepe don't belong in La Onda.
It's low class.
We're better than that.
Chale, my business
has nothing to do with La Onda.
- You're part of the clica.
- Mira, vato, I was Onda
before you were, huh?
Keep your whores in the rec room.
Get that fuckin' thing out of here!
Popeye's getting on my nerves.
Come on, you debutantes!
Got a once-a-year special on pork chops!
Sweet thing!
This shit'll make a man impotent...
but you ain't goin'
to no prom soon.
So, eat up, folks. Eat up.
Shit, man. Ain't nothin' but fat
on that bone. Gimme another chop.
Hate like hell to disappoint
your gods, bro, but unless you got
a carton of smokes, no seconds.
Motherfucker!
- Allah is blushing!
- I ain't no Muslim, man.
All right. Hey, how about
a little wager on this weekend's game?
Your odds stink, and I ain't movin'
till I get another chop.
Move on, nigger, before I carpet
my cell with your black skin.
- Hey, mother...
- All right, what's the hold-up?
Johnson, move it.
Punk-ass motherfucker!
All right, all the rest of you hungry
bunnies, get 'em while we got 'em.
There's your chop.
You happy now?
All right,
now for my brown brothers.
Sorry, no tortilla.
Wait a minute.
There's a ray of sunshine
in all that darkness down there.
Come up here, sweetness.
Come on, muévete.
You're keepin' all these
hungry beaners waitin', baby.
- Move on down!
- Get out of the way!
- Hey, what are you doin'?
What's the hold-up?
- Oh, it's okay, Sarge.
He was outta line.
He was in here before.
- Gimme your tray, homes.
- Come on!
You're catchin' a ride
on the wrong train.
You oughta be up here at the front of
the line, ahead of those jungle bunnies.
I don't take no free tickets
on no one's train.
Now you take a ticket,
or you get run over.
and eat with the white folks.
Know what I mean?
Flirt on your own time, Albert.
She's jealous!
- Hey, where's my chop?
- That was the last one.
Hey, I want my fuckin' chop, puerco.
Please be courteous to the help.
We've run out.
We only get pork once a year.
I know you got more back there.
Only for the kitchen detail.
Perhaps one of them might sell you one.
- I ain't buyin' what's mine!
- You know the fuckin' trip, homes.
No freebies.
Your mama was a freebie!
Hey, tough guy.
You want a write-up?
Maybe you wanna go to lock-up, huh?
Move it! Come on.
We got ten minutes here. Let's eat.
You sold our meat, Al.
You been gettin' by
with that shit too long.
We ran out. It happens.
Now move on, flycatcher.
Got hungry men behind ya.
you chickenshit motherfucker.
In your dreams, Pedro.
In your dreams.
Where the fuck do you think
you're trespassing into, huh?
- What do you want?
- I thought you wanted it.
- What?
- My chop.
I don't want his pork chop.
I want his life.
Oy,e, why don't you go play
with the polar bears...
or the may,ates?
They are tu estilo, Toluca.
- What's Toluca?
- That's the Aztec ball court.
Where you lose, you die.
- I'm gonna drop you, white boy!
- Go ahead, drop me.
I ain't afraid to die.
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Reggie! Carlo!
Hey, boy, that shit wouldn't happen
if you were up here with Daddy.
Fuckin'...
You speak Spanish, güero.
So do parrots.
I'm in here for backing up a carnal.
I killed a Tres Puntos 'cause
he was gonna take out my partner.
Soy, Chicano.
Chicanos killing Chicanos
is what they want.
Blacks and Chicanos killing
each other is what they want.
That's how they run this place.
Once we get together,
they don't run shit.
You got a lot to learn
about being Chicano, güero.
I'm no lightweight, and the colour
of my skin shouldn't keep me out.
White is the enemy.
White's the system.
You're stuck in the middle.
All my fuckin' life
I've been kept out.
You know what that feels like?
Knowing you're a Chicano...
and no one accepts you
'cause your skin came out white?
My mom's as brown as you are...
and my white dad tried to beat
every ounce of her outta me.
But you know what?
He couldn't do it.
Chicano's not a colour. It's the way
you think and the way you live.
And if you're willing to give up
your life for a carnal.
I'm here to do that.
Use me. Use this.
You said it.
Everything's based on colour, right?
I can get places you can't
'cause my skin's white on the outside.
But I'm brown on the inside,
to the bones.
The only way into La Onda is
to take down one of our enemies.
In your case, it would
have to be somebody big.
Someone who we can't hit without
losing a lot of carnales.
Gimme a chance!
Trust me.Just one chance!
Respect is everything, güero.
You ready to die for it?
Blood in, blood out.
Start cookin' breakfast
at 4:30 a.m.
Start dinner at 2:00. I'm startin' you
on pots and pans, with the niggers.
Thanks for nothin'.
l-I'll take whatever I can get, Al.
- Whatever you say.
- That's right, babycake.
I knew you'd wise up, sunshine.
- That greaser pimp can't do
half what I can do for you.
- Sounds nice.
Hey, Gil. Tell Red Ryder I got
that protein powder he wanted.
See that? You learn to treat me right,
and you get it all.
Food, coffee, cigs, drugs.
Hell, the works.
Come on over here.
Hey, clear outta here.
It's off-limits to everybody
but me and the staff.
Hey. You like that?
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.
So's this.
So this is where you keep
all the goodies, huh?
Some of'em.
- Pinto beans?
- No pintos for you, baby.
Nothin' but Texas barbecue.
- How 'bout it, sweetcheeks?
-Just remember, Al!
I fuck who I want, when I want.
All right. It's all right.
Take it easy. It's all right.
You treat me right, everything's
gonna be all crimson and clover.
Popeye tried to take it.
Almost bit his dick off!
Well, I can wait, baby.
That spic's a pig, got no class.
Just don't make Daddy
wait too long.
Come on now. Come on.
- You wild little bitch.
- This is just a sample.
- I'm gonna fuck your brains out.
- When I'm ready, Al.
When I'm ready.
The prices, they're so high.
- The prices don't mean nothing
unless they sell that much.
- I wanna stay!
Cruz, I've been looking
everywhere for you.
- I'm saying goodbye to my family.
- We were just leaving.
-Hey, Cruz, can you buy me
a low-rider when you get rich?
-Thanks for all you've done for our son.
- Please.
- A low-rider when you get rich!
- A low-rider.
- I wanna stay with Cruz.
- Bye, Alicia.
- Come with me, Cruz.
People want to meet you. You've
got to circulate. You're the artist.
You make them look so noble,
so, uh, fuerte.
I paint what I see.
So you really like it, huh?
- Oh, yes.
- I'm sorry, but I've got to
take him to a press photo.
- We'll bring him back in a few minutes.
- All right.
Janis, wh-what are you doing?
They were gonna buy something.
- Ah, they're looky-loos,
window-shoppers.
- How do you...
- How do you know that,Janis?
- Look, I thought we agreed
to keep tonight strictly business.
Yeah. So?
They went in.
How come they went in?
We both have a lot at stake, Cruz.
Don't let them blow it.
But, gentlemen, your names are not
on the list, and if you don't have
an invitation, you can't come in here.
Look, we don't need our names
on the list, ruca.
You see that face up there?
That's me.
Well, whether that's you or not, it
doesn't matter. Miss Weinstock needs to
say that it's okay for you to come in.
Have yourselves a good time.
Enjoy yourselves.
There. There's my invitation, okay?
Hey, hey, hey. l-It's okay, Belinda.
It's all right. It's all right.
- It's okay, Belinda.
- It's okay, Belinda.
Hey, Cruzito. Congratulations.
- Come up for an abrazo, ese.
- Orale, Gilbert. In a minute, homes.
Come check out the carrucha, carnal.
Cruz Candelaria, vato.
This is big time, homes.
Oy,e, it's too bright in here, ese.
Too much white.
Hey, Cruzito, homes.
What happened to our invitation?
- What, are you ashamed of Frankie?
- Are you ashamed of me, homes?
I'm glad you came, but why did you
have to bring Gilbert, that culero?
- You know Gilbert can smell money
from across town, homes.
- No shit.
- He came to help you spend that plata.
- Oh, shit, I can't pay him now, ese.
- I've only got ten bucks to my name.
- What, with those prices?
Hey, shit,
I ain't sold nothing, ese.
Well, maybe if we jack up a few
of these maricones, vato.
- I got the guy in the bell-bottoms.
- And I'll take everyone
without a bra, vato.
Be cool, ese.
I'm trying to hold it together.
Gilbert wants his full payback before
he's gonna give us any more credit.
- Be quiet.
- No, you f...
Relax. Here, have some pisto.
I'll see what I can do, all right?
- He says he'll take this price.
- Tell him I'm not negotiating.
The price is so low now,
it's a steal.
- He'll probably pass.
- That'll be his loss.
Listen,Janis, I need a cash advance.
Can you help me?
- I've already given you three advances.
- I need some money,Janis.
What good is it to have a show
if I don't sell anything?
Cruz, most of your paintings are already
spoken for by important collectors.
- What?
- You'll be completely sold out
by the end of the night.
Sold out? All of it?
Well, then why can't I get
some money tonight then?
Doesn't work that way. The cheques go
to the accountant to be processed.
No! I need some money now!
Do you understand me? Tonight!
Come on. I sold out,
so I deserve some, right?
You've got a brilliant career ahead
of you, Cruz, but all that talent
can go right in the garbage.
Think about that when you're
getting high with your friends tonight.
Please, no Baptist sermons,
okay,Janis?
Strictly business, remember?
Thank you.
I got a hot tip, Al.
How's my credit?
- Hey!
- Oh, come on. Don't be that way.
Nothin' like poppin' that cherry,
huh, Al?
Red Ryder, your mouth, your mouth.
- Lakers won in overtime, Al.
- Oh!
Give him a green one.
No, the other green one.
Why do you keep bettin'
on them L.A. teams, Lightning?
She looks a little bowlegged
to me, Al.
You're gonna always
be runner-up, punk.
I'm still gonna cut that VL placa
off of you, sissy.
Hey, Pancho, don't be a sore loser.
Get the fuck out of here.
I don't want that greaser pimp
even talking to you. Understand me?
Tomorrow is your day, güero.
Tonight you must read the black book.
These are the killing points. The arrows
show where a man can be killed.
Hit a man here or here,
and he dies slowly and painfully.
Hit a man here or here,
and he dies instantly.
When you get to the kitchen in the
morning, look in the largest stockpot.
Geronimo will be watching.
If you're successful tomorrow,
you'll become one of us.
If you fail, you die.
Hey, no, I got that, Howie.
Let a real man do the job.
It's all yours.
All right, you slaves!
I want them things cleaned
in one hour. Now, move it!
You, get to work!
Come on now. You heard the man.
Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it.
- You got to do what the man says.
- Hey, come on, man!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my back!
Oh, it's so hot!
- What do you want me to do?
- Somebody get that off! Oh!
Oh, it's burning my back! God! He burned
my back on purpose! I know he did!
- It hurts, damn it! It hurts!
- I know it hurts!
I can't do nothing for you.
Put-Put it... Put-Put it away!
Put it away!
Hey! What the fuck
are you doing in here?
I'm sorry. Excuse me. I didn't know.
- What are you doing in here?
- I didn't do anything.
- This room is off-limits.
- You shouldn't be in here, babycakes.
- All you men, back it up.
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry. I just wanted
more steel wool.
- You are fucking up, Al,
letting this kid in here.
- That's okay, Bob. He's cool.
- Cool, bullshit. Nobody else
is supposed to know about this.
- I won't say anything.
- Shut up!
- It's all right, Sergeant.
He does what I say.
Hey, I am not risking everything
for some piece of ass!
Just a goddam minute. You get paid
plenty for your risk, right? Am I right?
- Yeah, right.
- Well, all right then. Now, get moving.
We got plenty of trips for you to make.
And remember, I got a receipt for every
dollar you got in that money belt.
Hey, what the fuck are you looking at?
Get your ass right there,
stand there and don't move!
Bob, cover that money up.
How long does it take you to get
back here from the parking lot?
- Fifteen minutes.
- All right, I expect you
back here in... in ten.
- You keep this damn door closed.
- Don't you give me orders.
You just make sure nobody
sees you leaving here.
God damn you, you little bastard!
Don't you ever come in here!
I done told you!
Now get the fuck out of here!
You little prick tease! I'm tired of you
swinging your precious little ass around
like you own the joint!
You haven't put out worth shit!
I'm sorry, Al.
I fucked up. I know.
Forgive me.
I thought you were alone.
- Get out!
- Please don't hold it against me.
- Shut up!
- Please?
Let me make it up to you.
I know I've held back,
but I'm not gonna do it any more.
We don't have a lot of time.
Come on.
Let's get to it.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm gonna lick you clean.
- Do it, bitch.
- Lay back and enjoy it.
- Shit!
- I'm telling you, man.
Lieutenant, I don't know
what you're talking about.
Oh, you're trying to insult my
intelligence? You're Onda, he's BGA.
Look, I know you're
the gang coordinator,
but you side on the wolf ticket.
- Shit!
- Come on.
- Don't bullshit me.
Have a heart.
I'm trying to stay out of trouble.
I just want to get out of here.
I can make something of my life
before I get too old to enjoy it.
Al, I told you to keep the door...
You fuckin' little shit!
Okay, gentlemen, it was just
an accident. Get back to work.
You got breakfast to make.
Man down! Let's go! Storage room.
Man down. Let's go.
God damn it!
You all want to fuck with me?
Sergeant, I want you
to shake this place down.
I want the ID and background
on every man in here.
All right, I want to know who did it.
Somebody in here gets 25 years,
or you're all dead, so take your pick.
You shut up!
I wanna know who did it.
Everybody in here goes into lockdown.
No exercise, no rec room, no sunshine.
Get out of there!
No nothin' until I get some answers.
And until I do, you're not
gonna see the light of day.
Sergeant Devereaux!
Sergeant Devereaux, I want you
to strip-search these men.
Everyone here is going
to do time in the hole.
- Hello!
- Hey, big fella.
- You'll get it.
- Say, Sarge, where's the food?
- You'll get it! It's on its way.
Sarge, throw us the damn food, man!
If I don't get that damn book
and money back, you're not gonna
walk off this cell block alive.
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Your name's in that book, Bob.
- Hey, Bob.
- What?
Can I get an extra dessert tomorrow?
Hey, push this cart over here!
Let's move, man!
I'm getting hungry up here!
Shut the fuck up.
- Whose are they?
- They're a friend
of my brother's, home.
But he won't say shit.
He's asleep anyway.
- You're gonna get in trouble
if he wakes up.
- Nah, fuck that.
All right!
Hey, see you later, homes.
- He's gonna get pissed at you.
- No, I'll kick his ass.
- Hey, Cruz! I thought Chuey...
- Hey, man, this ain't no playground.
- Damn!
- Oy,e, pendejo,
you don't know how to knock?
I'm sorry, but it's cool.
I know what's up.
Chale, it ain't cool,
and you don't know what's up.
You understand?
I'm sorry. Your place is great,
and I wanna come back.
Okay, carnalito, but be cool. You can't
just barge in anywhere you want.
- All right.
- Go upstairs and watch TV
until Mom comes.
I took his shoes
and I threw them.
Go on. Go upstairs and practise so you
can be a badass like Bobby Chacon.
- Simón, eh?
- Hey, hey, hey!
Tell Mom that my back was hurting
so I had to take a nap, all right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, vete.
What the fuck's wrong with you?
You can't fucking be sonando yourself
when my carnalito's around.
- That's cool, homes.
- It ain't cool, homes.
Come on, Cruzito.
Come on, man. Come on down.
This will cure
your back pain, homes.
Ah. Painting those 22 masks
is a drag, homes.
I'm tired of this assembly-line shit.
It's money in the bank, Cruzito.
Paint some rucas, homes.
It's all right, she said
It's all right
- Take any,thing y,ou want from me
- Take the pain away.
Hey, paint some rucas naked.
Oh, man.
Ese, I don't want to spend
the rest of my life...
decorating rich people's
fucking living rooms.
Oh, I want to do
something different, ese.
You know, the way
that I see it, Cruzito...
you know, homes, you take the money
and you run, vato.
Yeah. I'll peddle for you, eh.
Fuck 'em, man.
I'll paint what I feel.
Fly, on, little wing
This is your bautismo, güero.
We created La Onda, the seven of us.
This is the inner circle.
Everyone is a capitán
and commands his own soldiers.
We all have an equal vote,
but I am the elected spokesman.
This is the last time
you will ever sit in this circle.
You've proven yourself,
so we're admitting you into Onda.
It's a commitment for life.
As a soldier,
you will answer to this council...
and carry out our orders
without question.
Failure to do so is death.
Blood in...
blood out.
Please, somebody!
Juanito?
God!
Help! Somebody, please help!
Help!
- Don't touch him! Don't touch him!
- What's wrong, Mom?
- Leave him alone!
- Mom?
Stop it! You!
You did this, you bastard!
- We got to get out of here, Cruzito.
-Juanito!
- There's nothing left!
- Cruz!
Please bring my baby back.
Please.
There's nothing we can do! If we don't
get outta here, we're fucked!
Okay? Come on, please!
-Juanito?
- Come on!
Please get up. Oh, come on.
You can do it.
Get up. Please, son, get up!
Oh, God, no!
The Lord is my shepherd.
There is nothing I shall want.
Fresh and green are the pastures
where He gives me repose.
Near restful waters He leads me
to revive my drooping spirit.
Surely goodness and kindness shall
follow me all the days of my life.
In the Lord's own house
shall I dwell...
forever and ever.
Let us begin. In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Let us offer our prayers.
Beloved...
Not now! Not ever!
You are dead to me, like Juanito.
Let us pray.
Lord Jesus Christ,
by Your own three days in the tomb...
you allowed the graves of all
who believe in You to be made holy.
So you made the grave a sign of hope
that promises resurrection...
even as it claims our mortal bodies.
Grant that our brotherJuanito
may sleep here in peace...
until you awaken him to glory.
Then he will see You
face to face...
and in Your light, we shall see life
and know the splendour of God...
for You live forever and ever,
amen.
It's okay, jefito.
You can cry if you want.
The Aryan Vanguard's been insulted.
You spics knew Big Al had
an insurance policy with the AV.
So when your little lamb strays
from the flock...
I'm gonna kill the boy!
I heard that.
Al deserved to die.
Besides, your AV-ers owed him
more money than anybody else.
He still dies.
The council has authorized me
to make a substantial cash offer...
to assure nothing happens to Miklo.
- I'm listening.
- Half of Al's cash.
Eight thousand dollars.
We're now open for business.
You don't give me squat.
You don't even do business
unless I say you can.
You understand?
So?
So, what are you giving
on the Lakers-76ers?
Give the puto four on 76.
76ers and four points.
- Give me the Lakers for a hundred.
- I'll take some of that action myself.
Miklo, if Onda's going
into business, carnal...
people have to know they can trust us,
so treat everybody the same.
The AV-ers control the dope, and the
BGA-ers are trying to move in on them.
We'll do business with both of them.
Money knows no colour, carnal.
Everybody likes to gamble.
All right, all you little old ladies.
It's the milkman!
Come on. It's time to collect
all that milk money.
That's all I can do. I'll give you
a half point more, that's it.
- Yeah.
- All right. Hey, man,
that's the point spread.
- Gotta be cool, bro.
- Be cool.
Christmas time. Pancho Villa.
We gotta start helping
our gente get out of here.
You should be ashamed.
Quit looking at boobs.
Look at a boob tube,
compliments from El Mero Mero.
My BGA brothers. Pockets!
Gotta get rid of that natural look,
go back to processing.
- You'll look like me, vato, huh?
- Hey, how about those Raiders, chump?
It's gonna be two-for-one, bro.
Two for me, and one for you!
Hey, man, don't talk to me about credit.
I got debts as thick as a phone book.
Now that Mosca and Flaco
are getting transferred down to Chino...
we'll have a base close to
the courts in Los Angeles.
Give 'em some money
so they can set up a legal fund.
- Recruit some soldiers.
- You got it, jefe.
Come on!
This is my parole picture, huh?
Hey! You only get paroled once, huh?
Magic. Something to remember you by.
All right. Okay. Here we are now.
All right, vato. Take a picture.
Oh, come on.
Hey, I got people waiting.
Ready?
You know, I grew up about
ten blocks from here, but this place
blows my mind, Carmen.
It looks like Hawaii, man.
My father planted this 40 years ago.
Created the whole Yucatan
right here.
Carmen's the best chef
in all of East Los.
- Is that right?
- Uh-huh.
Suck on this liquorice stick.
It's been dipped 20 times
to make you hump all night long, Paco.
With you two around, I ain't
gonna need no marriage counsellor.
- I like your style, Paquito.
- I'll check it out.
I know this shit is good, 'cause,
like, the last batch you made...
was dynamite, man.
But the only trip is,
I'm wondering if you can supply
the quantity that I'll need, see?
- I mean...
- First the money.
Then the honey.
All right, look.
You see my homey out there?
You got nine more grand.
Now show me yours.
Get him a caja.
- Okay.
- Make sure not to shake the baby food.
PCP is very explosive.
Boom!
I'd hate to lose
such a handsome customer.
Mmm, Mommy. That feels good.
You might need it for later, hmm?
So did you really make this stuff?
You a chemist?
I worked in a medical lab.
Hey, baby.
Have you ever had a threesome?
What's the matter?
Too much for you?
No, I just like business
before pleasure.
- He's a fucking cop!
- Rollie, get in here now!
You son of a bitch!
No!
No!
You killed my baby! My...
- Oh, it's PCP! Don't breathe!
- Motherfucker! Get this shit off of me!
Oh, shit! We gotta get you
to the hospital. No, no, no.
Get me a hose! We gotta wash
this stuff off. Don't breathe!
- Shit. It's a bust, ese.
- God damn it.
We lost the fucking lab
and Clavo's money.
That pinche loan shark's gonna shit!
How we gonna pay him back now?
- We lost everything.
- Mira, mira, there's Carmen, eh.
- Come on, man. Turn around.
- Who's that?
- What?
- Hey, she's signalling someone, man!
- Hey, hey, Paco, get back here!
- We gotta wash that stuff off you!
- Draw in the perimeter!
- Wilson, call it in!
Block Mario in on the radar!
- Police! Stop the car!
Pull over the fucking car!
Stop the car.
Put your hands on the steering wheel
right now and keep your hands up!
- Let's go. Out of the car.
- Careful, careful.
You two, out of the car.
Orale, that's a nice placa
you got there, ese.
You should be riding with me,
not fucking with me, carnal.
Don't you call me carnal, you piece
of shit. I'm not your brother.
Scumbags like you
are killing off our kids.
- What an example to set for the kids.
- Listen, you motherfucking rat punk!
I'm gonna put you and your rat clica
back in the joint, you hear me?
- You keep talking. You keep talking!
- All right, all right, Paco.
- Let's... Hey! Let's go.
- Check the trunk.
- Put some clothes on, man.
- Hey, you got a warrant?
-Check that trunk.
-What do you think you are, bulletproof?
- God damn it. Check it, Rollie.
- Check the trunk.
So you think I never seen
an OD before?
What's the matter?
You don't recognize your own son?
- Hey, fuck you. That ain't Hector.
- No, Hector's only 11 .
That boy's 13.
If your boss Savedra
keeps manufacturing that shit,
it'll put Hector in the cemetery too.
but you still smell
like chorizo, pig.
This pig is the only thing
standing between you and them...
but you ain't gonna get
through me, punk.
I ain't no rata.
Yeah, you're a rat. Get up. Go.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe
my time here in this institution...
has turned me completely around,
and I'm very grateful.
Now I think I can make it
as a productive member of society.
Mr Velka, isn't it true
that you clique with La Onda...
a group whose motto
is "Blood in, blood out"...
meaning you have to kill someone
in order to become a member?
I hung out with a group who were
my friends from my old neighbourhood.
Our reputation grew out of defence of
each other, but that's not... that's it.
Nothing more.
They didn't even listen.
They fucked me.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Miklo,
and make something of your life.
I don't ever want to see you
in here again.
This is my daughter.
Look at her.
Look at her! She was only
six months old when I came here.
She grew up without me.
I don't even know her.
- That ain't right, carnal.
- No, it's not, but it's that way
for too many of us.
That's why your parole
is so important.
You've got to prove
there's another way.
You got a chance to do it.
I don't.
Right on, carnal. Right on.
- Thank you.
- You gotta start acting like somebody
who deserves parole, carnal.
Put it on the record.
Earn your freedom on paper, ese.
All they got in front of them
is your jacket.
You are your jacket,
'cause to them you're just a number.
Everyone who enters the joint
thinks he's a man,
but you know what he really is?
A number worth 30 grand a year.
They want us to come back...
and what's worse, they have us
lining up to get in, ese.
We gotta turn the system around.
We gotta outthink them.
Now, concentrate.
Why do you deserve parole, Mr Velka?
Sir, I've been in prison
almost a third of my life.
I've grown up here.
I've learned to read and write here.
I earned my GED.
Mr Velka,
this board's only concern...
Sir, with all due respect,
look at my record.
I've worked hard to prove
I deserve another chance.
It's in there in black and white.
Please give me another chance.
