Hey.
Hey.
WOMAN: Hey.
Hey, how about a nice, big,
juicy good morning kiss?
Not with that
good morning breath.
Ha.
Well...
Look, just one kiss.
Come on. That's all I want.
Just one kiss.
Okay.
Come on back.
Since you're so sweet,
you can have just a little--
Aah!
[GIGGLING]
Hi-yah!
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
What are you doing?
Sergeant Sausage is present
and ready for duty, okay?
Prepare for insertion.
[LAUGHS]
Wait. At ease.
Sergeant Sausage,
Veda's a vegetarian.
Look, just calm down
and close your eyes, all right?
It ain't gonna take but a minute
while I'm up in it.
So I'm marrying
the minute man now, huh?
You knew that going in.
Kid, stop.
What?
VEDA:
The wedding is days away.
I know. And my nuts are
as blue as these sheets.
Come on, hit a nigger off.
I'll hit you, all right.

MACHINE:<i>
Hi, this is Shireen
from The Good Girls--</i>
Come on, baby, let it run.
Can't be anybody important.
I'm already here.
Oh, uh-huh. I got to get it.
It might be about a job.
STINKY:<i>
Yo, hey, hey, hey,
wake up, Play.</i>
Shit.
Hey, girl,
I know he's there.
I don't know
why your fine ass
is wasting your time
with him anyway.
You need to be chillin'
with me.
Because, girl, I'll lick you
like an ice cream cone
on a hot summer's day.
Damn, you a fine girl.
It's your friend
that's not potty-trained.
It's my cousin. Someone's got
to look out for him.
Or just look out.
Boy, you sure look good
this morning.
You're missing something
though.
Check this out.
Aw, yeah.
Now...
Talk to me.
What's up for breakfast?
Talk to me.
Talk to him. Give to him.
I'll tell you,
based on the color scheme,
I think this looks
better on you.
STINKY:<i>
We got to get ready to pick up</i>
<i> Kid's dread-head cousins
from the airport</i>
and then we got to plan
the bachelor party.
And then we need to talk about
my 50, 50, 50 fractions
of Kid and Play's productions
that you guys owe me
for my personal
services, man.
Stinky, if you go to school
like your mother wants,
you'd understand
the business more,
The percentages
instead of the fractions.
And right now I'm trying
to close a very important deal.
I'm gonna have to get
with you later, Stinky.
KID:
I'm not asking for much.
Hook me up with some of
that French toast you be makin'.
When you have it stacked up.
And just laying on the side,
the strawberries.
Chillin'.
VEDA:
I've never made
any French toast.
You have me confused
with Sydney again.
Damn.
Uh, ha, ha. Check it out.
You know what happened?
Let me tell you. I was trippin'.
I made a mistake.
See, what had happened was,
that was Play.
Okay? And he had gone
to France,
right, with his girl,
and at one point
they made a toast.
So it was a French toast.
Don't even try it, Kid.
People do not toast
with malt liquor,
and that is all
I have ever seen Play drink.
You're busted.
What's up with you?
When we started going out,
you promised me
we could make demo.
A demo? Come on, baby,
I can do better than that.
I'm hooking you up with one
of the largest promoters ever,
a brother
by the name of Showboat.
I'm gettin' with him
this morning.
Yeah, right.
That's right.
And, um, I hope when
we give you that call,
that surprise call,
that you're ready.
Play.
Yep.
Play.
What?
Oh...
I sure hope Kid's cousins
have bus fare.
Oh, Janelle is throwing me
a little party Friday night.
Nothing big.
Just a few of the girls.
Perhaps some wine.
A male stripper.
Well, have a good time.
Let me know what went down
with that, all right?
VEDA:
Okey-dokey.
Yoo-hoo.
Yes, darling?
Did you male dancer?
No. I said stripper.
Wh--? Oh, my bad.
Stripper.
Janelle got some guy
named Night Heat.
Night Heat?
Night Heat.
She thought the girls
would get a kick out of it.
Can I kick Janelle?
No, you can't.
In the organ of my choice,
repeatedly?
No, you can't,
because she will kick back.
I can't have you two
kicking each other.
See you later.
Johnny Booze, what's up?
Yeah, it's Playtime.
We got to make this brief,
'cause I'm calling from the car.
Yeah, my boy,
his bachelor party.
That's right.
Of course I got the dough.
Yo, just get a pen out, man.
Friday night
at the Densmore Hotel.
That's right.
Now, who you got?
Angina Williams?
Angina-- Angina Williams?
Yo, ain't that the girl
that does the disappearing act
with the beer bottles?
Bet. Perfect for Kid.
Yo, good lookin' out, man.
Don't let me down.
All right cool.
Peace out, black.
Yo, Angina Williams, man.
Tell me something.
How did your fowl ass
pull some move like that?
I keep trying to tell you
and Kid. It's the American way.
BOY:
Excuse me, sir.
Yes, can I help you?
Sir, we just flew in
from Detroit
to perform in front
of some senior citizens,
and all our luggage
is gone.
Our show clothes.
My CD player.
George.
George? Who's George?
You know. George.
His teddy bear.
CLERK:
Oh, your teddy bear.
Gee, I'm so sorry,
but I know how it feels.
My Slinky died two years ago.
I still wake up crying.
This is an insurance form.
You know how to fill it out,
don't you?
You write down
"Socks, $50,000."
And you were carrying a car
in your suitcase.
May God bless you.
Oh, and God bless you too.
Sorry about the eye.
Did you lose that also?
Yo, yo, yo, slow down.
Pull over here.
What for?
Just pull over.
We got to get our luggage, fool.
Yo, I thought they lost
your luggage.
Nah, stupid. You think we dumb
enough to lose our luggage?
We were just trying to make
some more vacation money.
You know, to bring
some girls to Hawaii.
Do you know what you punks did
is against the law?
You could end up
in juvie hall.
That's the first stop
to the big house.
Know what they do to boys
in the big house?
Make little girls out of them.
When we get there, we'll say
hello to your low-life friends.
Take us to Capital Records,
MCA, Motown and Virgin Records,
to let everybody know
that Immature is in the house.
The only house
you're gonna be in
is the house you'll be
in all summer on punishment.
You ain't cuttin' up
like you did last summer,
you understand me?
[♪♪]
Yo, watch the finish.
Watch the finish.
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
The wild bunch is here.
Yo, what's up fellas?
What's going on?
What's up, man?
All right.
LUCY:
Well, well, well.
Hello, Aunt Lucy.
What's up, Veda?
Aunt Lucy, these are your
brother Petey's grandchildren.
If you say so.
Honey, your pants
are too big,
but Aunt Lucy gonna
take care of that.
Play and Stinky, I brought
some lunch. It's on the table.
BOTH:
Oh, word.
That's what I'm talking about.
And I hope everybody ate,
'cause I ain't saving
a damn thing.
Fellas, I want you
to meet my fiancée Veda.
Hi guys. Oh, you're so cute.
Look at your little dreads.
I don't which one of you
is the cutest.
You pretty cute
yourself too.
Damn, Kid, I didn't know
you had it going on like this.
She is fine.
Hey, Kid, what happened
to that big booty girl?
The one
you went to college with.
Ooh, look at the time.
We have a meeting today
that we're late for.
We have a meeting,
so we have to go.
And we're late.
Uh, Play, Stinky. Play.
You know, the big booty girl.
I think her name was Sydney.
Play, Stinky, we got a meeting.
Come on, let's roll.
Well, what's with all
these worms in your head, boy?
I hope you left some food
for the little ones.
Of course, we did, Aunt Lucy.
Of course, we did.
Now, well,
of course, I did.
Now, Veda said you could have
something to eat.
She didn't say go and eat up
all that Chinese food.
It was fried chicken,
Aunt Lucy.
Hush your mouth.
Chinese people don't eat
fried chicken.
What?
Kid, I'm telling you
right now,
we're going sell
Sex As A Weapon to Showboat.
Wait a minute, we haven't
even signed them yet.
I thought we were having
this meeting to find out
if he was even
interested.
Come on, Kid, you know
I got the skills, man.
We're gonna get
the girls to sign.
We gonna sell them to Showboat.
It's the American way.
Selling what you don't own.
I do it all the time.
This could backfire, man.
This could backfire big time.
Play, don't you know what
you're doing is against the law?
Keep it up,
and you'll end up in the joint,
in the cell next to ours.
Yeah.
Just once.
Come on,
just once, man.
Let me just hit him once,
you know?
Whoo.
[♪♪]
Okay, have a seat, guys.
Have a seat.
Look, now, we're here
on business, all right?
I want you to act like
you got some home training.
Tsk, man, we know
how to act in public.
All right, I don't wanna have
to hurt you.
SHOWBOAT:
No, I told you
I'm not hearing that.
Look, I'll come over there
and slap your mouth.
You better get my money.
I'm not playing, boy.
Get my money. Get it now.
PLAY:
Showboat, what's up?
Hey, hey, fellas. Fellas.
Let's make some money.
Talk to me quick.
Whoo!
Uh, Showboat...
Hey, yo, move that shit
off the table.
Thanks, slice.
Go ahead.
Uh, Showboat, we really
wanna work with you.
We have what we believe to be
a solid business proposition
that'll prove to be lucrative
for all parties involved.
Well, I like it
so far.
You know that girl group

Oh, them girls

Well, it just so happens

And we wanna do business
with you.
You know, I got a 12 city tour
of the Chitlin Circuit.
Uh, we about to start
right now.
And you know,
a group like Sex As A Weapon
could set that baby
on fire.
Give me three G's,
and we got a deal.
Wait. Why do I need
to go through you?
I'm the man.
Shit, Play, you ain't
nothing but a sucker MC.
And Kid,
your jelly ain't shit.
Stinky, well, I think
the names speaks for itself.
Yo, my name ain't Stinky,
it's James.
[DOG BARKS]
Getting all excited.
You don't seem to understand,
Sex As A Weapon ain't doing jack
without our say so.
Uh, uh, what he means
to say, Showboat,
is that, uh, they respect
our opinions with regard
to their career moves.
Yo, Kid, cut all that bullshit
out, man.
You obviously don't know
who you dealing with.
How you work
this thing?
I know who I'm dealing with,
and it better be local.
[PHONE RINGS]
Hello.
Yeah, this is Play.
Uh...
Say hello
to the man himself, Showboat.
Showboat, I can't believe
it's for real.
Yeah, shit's unbelievable, baby.
I know. Go ahead. Go ahead.
PLAY:
Uh, we talking about
a 12 city tour, sweetheart.
And, um, all you got
to do is say yes,
and Play will take care
of the rest.
[SCREAMS]
There it is.
Um, you know what?
I'll bring home the condoms...
I'm sorry, I'll bring home
the contracts tonight, baby.
Keep it clean.
Hook them up,
Ms. Pain.
Hook me up.
Uh, aren't there a few things
we should discuss
before we start taking
Showboat's money?
PLAY:
What are you talking--?
Kid, ain't nothing
but a G thing, baby.
We all adults here.
Showboat trust us.
He's a businessman.
We are businessmen's.
Ah, you are
a silly motherfucker.
Showboat
don't trust shit.
No, no, no,
my daddy always said
don't trust nobody but your mama
and then cut the deck.
Fuck that. Make sure you do
what you say you gonna do.
You got my money, boy.
Oh, oh, oh.
One more thing.
Go have a good time.
But look, look,
whatever you do,
you can talk about my mama,
steal my car, take my jewelry,
but don't mess
with my money.
Oh, when you do that,
you done...
Then you messin'
with the wrong G.
The wrong G.
Now, um, here's the list of
those 12 cities we talked about.
Uh, make sure
you have those girls
sign that contract
by tomorrow.
And until then, heh,
let's make some money.
It was just really nice
this morning, you know.
Kid had his reunion
with his little cousins.
And they are three
of the cutest little boys
you ever want to see,
until one of them asked Kid
what happened
to the big booty girl
he used to date
in college.
Oh, no, he didn't.
Oh, yes, he did.
Was he talking about Sydney?
Don't say that "S" word.
Oh. Not with this day
I've been having.
Not only that.
Kid kept going on about
how good my French toast is.
But you don't like
French toast.
Veda, you're my baby cousin,
and I love you.
But if you're having
second thoughts about this,
then maybe you ought
to keep on thinking.
You're more than welcome
to continue living with me.
I love having you.
No, if Kid
were not ready,
he would not have saved
for our condo.
Bought me this ring.
He could have a car.
Janelle, I am wearing
the man's car.
He announced
our engagement, not me.
He never got this far
with Sydney.
Yeah, that's because Sydney
had some sense.
[PLAYING JAZZ MUSIC]
Okay, guys. Guys, guys,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm your nerves.
Have a seat. Have a seat.
All right? Just sit down and do
whatever Stinky tells you.
You sit down too.
I keep telling you I ain't
no babysitter for these kids.
I need to be trying
to impress them girls.
Play,
take me with you, man.
They look at me,
they'll sign that contract.
Stinky, do me a favor.
Either wash your ass
or sit the hell down
and shut up.
KID:
Please.
Hi, Kid.
Hi, Kid.
Uh, I mean, hi, ladies.
Know what? We need to talk
in a better business atmosphere.
So why don't we kick it
in the ball with some drinks?
Our treat.
Right this way.
Right this way.
Please.
Ooh, this is what
I'm talking about.
Getting down

Some business.

He's right.
Real business.
Business minds.
Big money.
Business. Kid.
Kid?
Uh.
Oh. I'm sorry.
You got to excuse my friend,
he's zoning out.
This weekend,
he's getting married.
And, um, you know,
we're planning
a big bachelor party
for him on Friday.
You know what?
Why don't you come down
and help me change his mind?
Well, anyway, for starters,
uh, let's get some drinks.
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
That's French,
you know? Heh.
MAN:
Can I take
your drink order?
Um, I'd like a Slow Screw
Against the Wall.
Ooh. I'll have
a Sex on the Beach.
You know what? I can take care
of these orders myself.
Beat it, Benson.
Oh, before you go, uh,

Okay.
We anticipated that you could

You know
what I'm saying?
To fatten the pockets
and put the cash in my hand.
Sound good to me.
PLAY:
That might not be a problem.
Wait, wait. Okay.

You coming off like they're
supposed to be helpless females.
I mean, let's think
about it here,
has it occurred to you that
perhaps they're enjoying this
just as much as I am?
Ever thought about that?
Yeah, I have,
and it frightens me.
Look, the sooner
we get this started,
the sooner I can
get out of here.
Now, did you reserve
the tuxes for the ushers?
Yes, I reserved the tuxes
for the ushers
and I'm gonna pay
for them too.
That's the least you could do.
The bride pays for everything.
And it'll be the last thing
she pays for.
After that ring
is on her finger,
that's her carte blanche
to do what she pleases.
While my man's
breaking his back,
because she turns
to the gimme gimme girl.
I knew
you was primitive,
but I didn't think
you was a pure caveman.
I guess it goes down like that
with those gold-digging,
hoochie-mama, gut bucket
skeezas you attract,
but tell me something, what
do you really have to offer?
I mean, really?
Well, it just so happens
that what I have to offer
might be more than
you can handle, Janelle.
And when you are ready
to become a full-fledged woman,
why don't
you give me a call?
Baby, I'm full,
I'm fledged,
and I'm all woman,
but I need
more than a snack.
I need a whole meal.
Janelle, sweetheart,
woman, I'll have
you talking in tongues.
Tsk.
I gotta go.
I'll bet you do.
You done lost your mind.
And uh, speaking of tongues,
like I said,
you two are gonna be big.
Man, I ain't got
no money.
I got to get
the millionaire's fund.
Come on,
multiplatinum.
Oh, multiplatinum, baby,
I'll be rich.
Oh, you'll be
paid today.
Pay him up.
You pay him up, punk.
Everybody pay me up.
Come on. Both of you pay.
What's up, guys?
What's going on?
What's up, cousin Kid?
What kind of game is that?
The music biz.
Yep.
The music biz.
This one's
a concert promoter.
Yeah, this beautiful woman
right here is,
Mm-mm, unh.
is a groupie.
See, Kid, we're ready.
We got the game down.
Now it's about
getting paid big-time.
You know real money.
KID:
Look, it's not easy, okay?
I've been in the music business
four years now
and it doesn't get
any easier.
It's very difficult.
And you have to work
really hard.
Don't worry, Kid.
We're smart.
We see how to do it wrong
by watching you and Play.
[KIDS CHUCKLE]
Y'all some good teachers.
[SCOFFS]
[DOOR BELL RINGS]
Hey, boy!
KID: Uncle Vester.
Kid.
Aunt Lucy.
Oh.
Look at that woman there.
Lord have mercy.
Oh, Vester, heh, it's so good
to see you, ha, ha.
Come here, woman.
Oh.
There.
I'm over here.
[BOTH LAUGH]
How you doing?
Heh.
You still crazy
as a betsy bug,
Heh.
and looking good too, woman.
Like a sandwich.
What's up, Kid?
You're the yellow version
of your pappy.
Aunt Lucy... Mm.
Damn.
Boy, I miss your father.
KID:
So do I.
Damn. I wish
he was here.
Me too, Uncle Vester.
Besides, he owe me a $150.
Uncle Vester,
do you remember me?
Do I remember you?
Let me tell you.
Last time, boy, I saw you,
you was his size,
and last time, boy,
I saw you,
you was his size,
and last time I saw you,
there was doo-doo
in your drawers.
Hey, man,
you just got here,
don't be sweating me like that.
VESTER: Sweating.
I ain't began to sweat you.
First thing tomorrow, we're
going down to Elmo's barbershop
and cut that Jamaican voodoo
stuff off of your head.
You better regulate your uncle
before I bust a cap in his butt.
What you say to me?
What you say to me, boy?
Let me tell you something.
I said Uncle Vester
cool like that.
That's what
I thought you said, heh.
That's what
I thought you said.
You right. Aunt Lucy, heh,
I bought you something.
You know I can't come
Oh.
without bringing you anything.
You didn't.
Hey, my favorite auntie,
heh, yeah.
Ha, ha, you know I did.
Look here. This is for you.
Oh, Vester.
Heh, ha, ha.
Isn't that beautiful?
If lost, please return to
1637 Blast Ave., Los Angeles.
Vester.
Sit down.
Okay, look, all right.
All right.
I think it's about
that time, guys.
Let's go to bed,
and we'll play tomorrow.
I'll take them
upstairs, come on.
Where's the stairs,
honey?
The stairs are right
where they've always been.
Okay.
Doggone right.
Ten o'clock. Supposed to be
in bed any doggone way.
Only my Kool-Aid
don't know the flavor.
Ain't my business.
So, boy, you're getting
married, man.
So tell me about
your financee. Is she pretty?
Oh, my fiancée?
Yeah.
KID:
Ooh, oh, she's very pretty.
Can she cook?
Oh, yes, she can cook.
You, you don't have...
She ain't knocked up, is she?
No, no.
Good. Good.
Well, you got
Uncle Vester's blessings.
Uncle Vester gonna go upstairs.
I'm kind of tired.
Uncle Vester, before you go,
I wanted to ask you something.
What you need, son?
Well, see, my girl and I,
we get along fine.
Uh-huh.
But I'm just having
a little problem
getting her parents to like me.
Parents?
Why get 'em to like you for?
Boy, just be yourself.
If people don't like you
if you're being yourself,
fuck them.
Let me tell you something.
I just got a girl
when I was about your age.
I always tried to please
her pappy all the time,
went out of my way
to please her pappy.
I come in one day, I said,
"Nice weather we have,"
and he said,
"You can't say that.
You can't say that.
It might rain."
I said,
"Nice tie you got on."
He said you can't say that.
My wife tried to choke me with.
The point I'm trying to
tell you, son, is be yourself.
People don't like
being yourself, fuck them!
Fuck them up
against the wall
with handcuffs on
and Krazy Glue on their lips.
That's all you do.
Hmm.
Words to live by.
Live by them, son.
Um, I'm gonna go to the club
now, uh, Uncle Vester,
and just go.
VESTER:
You go on
and enjoy yourself, boy.
You're about to sell your soul
in a couple of days.
Brother,
you did a good job.
It's a good kid.
Always been a good kid.
That's why I call him Kid,
heh.
Boy just need some
goddamn fun
like Casper
the friendly ghost.
Scared the hell out of me
when I came here.
Mm.
Mm!

Don't say that "J" word, man.
I'm gonna say it. Job,

And maybe they're right.
I mean, it's not like
I can just think about

I'm gonna have

She got a job too, don't she?
Nigga.
Come on, man, we got to put

I mean, you know, come on,

Look out there.
What do you see?

Not that, man.
I mean, look out there, man,

They just don't come true

There's hard work

Am I just going crazy?
Didn't we have a dream?

Yeah, I remember.
But look,
I'm getting older now.
Would you believe I've even

Oh, this is more serious

I almost bought a tie.
Wait. You're

Yo, man, I know
we've been through a lot,
I don't always come through,
but this one
I feel real good about, man.
Just give me a little time
on this one, man.
You know what?
I'll make a deal with you.
Straight up and down.
If I don't come through

I'll go get a haircut with you

Cajun is an acquired taste.
That's why didn't
nobody order it.
KID 1: What about breakfast?
Yeah, I'm hungry.
KID 2: Oh, yeah.
Look.
There. Breakfast.
It's the best I can do.
Look, if I don't get out here

I'm not gonna get paid.
I got to get out of here too.
I got me a date.
You do?
And who's the lucky lady?
The chef at
Rollo's Chicken 'n' Grits House.
I'm hungrier than a horse.
I'm getting out of here.
So, Kid, you're going
to let us bust
our little rap
at your bachelor party?
Yeah, Kid. You know
that's why we're here.
See, we look at it,
is the party gonna be
filled with big-booty girls,
honeys, tenders, you know?
KID:
Hello? Hello? Look.
Fellas, there are not gonna be
any honeys at the party.
Just the fellas.
Just the fellas.
So get it out of your head.
Just calm down, relax
and get ready
for the wedding. Okay?
See, I told you Kid 'n Play
are played out, man.
Just like this food.
We out of here, man.
No, no, wait a minute.
Sit down. Wait.
Boys, boys, come back here
and eat this food.
Don't you want to grow tall?
Get them, Aunt Lucy.
Hit them in the throat
with the stick.
Bust their head! I hate them.
You know, Aunt Lucy, man.
She still thinks Sammy Davis
is sleeping in the guest room.
You know, she's a couple
of salads away from a picnic.
Look, I'm proud
of you, boy.
I'm proud of what you did
with the youngsters.
You sat there and you told
them kids, man,
that there won't be any women
at that bachelor party.
I'm proud of you.
But I know there's gonna be
a few women
at that bachelor party.
Look, Veda is the only woman
for me.
I'm trying to go
into this marriage right.
No women.
Boy, nobody is talking about
no women for you.
I'm talking about some women
for me. What's wrong with you?
Ah, look, I'm sorry.
Look, uncle--
I'm sorry for you. Go on.
Uncle Vester, I gotta go.
Boy, you had to go on
and get a white woman,
now you're gonna wreck
this man.
The boy ain't worth
two day of flash mess.
You know, Uncle Kid
is dissing us, man.
Who you're telling? He won't
even listen to our demo.
Yeah, he won't even let us go
the bachelor party.
Eh, yo, yo, Jerome.
Peep this out, dude.

Hey, we definitely got

So here on in,
we're doing our own thing.

Pfft, give me

Why you all dressed

We go to private school,
fetus face.
Oh, we go to
Detroit Public School.
Now how did
I know that?
Listen, we're staying at that
house over across the street.
Sixteen thirty seven,
Blast Ave.
Friday night we got
the crib to ourselves. Heh.
And we were just thinking
about having a little party.
Yeah.
A serious throw down,
Detroit-style.
Hey, bring your messed butt

Before I have

Every summer
I have to kill somebody.
I'm tired of killing folks
every summertime.

Why don't you come.
And oh yeah, wear that uniform.
Heh, yeah, because I like girls

What's up, man?
What's up?
What's up?
Uh, where's
Kid and Play?
They ain't here.
They ain't here?
Where the hell
are they at?
Look, man,
we had a meeting here.
I ain't got time to wait. I got
to pick up money over here,
pick up money over here,
and I came to pick money
right here.
Look here. You tell them
when they get here
Johnny Booze stopped by
to pick up the money
for the Angina Williams,
okay?
That's the stripper
for the bachelor party.
Oh, yeah.
They told me that
you'll be stopping by
and to pay you
if you can pop this check.
Oh, let me see that.
Let me see that.
Money first.
Wait. I got money.
Don't play me like I ain't.
I handle mine.
Check it out.
Wait, man. I got more,

Wait.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Oh.
Okay, all right.
All right, ooh, shit.
All right. Here we go.

Same time, bro.
I don't know you, man.
Same time. I don't know you.
Okay. Same time.
Give me the check.
Now you know
the party is gonna be here
instead of hotel,
right?
Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool. Okay.
You tell Play
Angina gonna be here
Friday night, all right?
And look, you tell them
I need the rest of my money.
I owe people.
A Couple of my girls
got killed in a car wreck.
I need the money.
We know.
Shut up.
[♪♪]
Yo, that's the dancer
that Janelle hired
for Veda's party.
Yo, pull over, man.
I wanna peep this guy.
I can't let
any old muscle bound
booty shaking chump
dancing at my baby's party.
Come on.
Come on, Kid, be for real, man.
We got a lot to do, man.
We got three days to
the wedding. Three days, man.
We got no time to be worried
about, heh, the competition.
You know, Kid, man, dog,
I don't mean no harm, man.
Your shit's over, man.
Do you know who Night Heat is?
That's Henry Charles.
Think.
I went to high school
with him, man.
The boy is large.
Took showers with him, man.
His shit is huge.
He must be from Africa.
He said it's huge, man.
Wait a minute.
You checking out his jimmy?
No--
Look, Play,
Your cousin needs
some serious counseling.
There's no question
about that.
But seriously, sisters be
sweating that brother,
sweating him
something awful.
I'm telling you,
he drives the honeys crazy.
Look at that line.
Look at all those girls.
And guys in the line too.
You know how big it is.
Yo man, the wedding
might be off
when Veda peeps a peek at
the pole that brother's packing.
Try and say that three times.
Janelle, you're
my maid of honor, right?
Mm-hm.
Then why don't you have
your little butt over here
helping me figure out
who I'm gonna sit next to who?
Whoa, Veda.
This says that 50 percent
of all marriages
end in divorce.
Divorce.
And after only three years
of marriage
couples have sex
once a week.
Once a week.
And when they do,
they don't even like it.
Did you know, Janelle--
What?
That ever since Kid and I
announced our engagement,
well, you've changed.
I've changed?
You've changed.
I've changed?
You've changed.
I've changed?
Yes,
you have really been
dogging Kid out lately.
Because he is a dog.
He is not a dog.
He is a man. The man
that I'm going to marry.
Thank you.
Well, I know Play.
And Play is 100 percent
all dog.
Atomic dog. Mighty dog.
Underdog. Deputy Dog.
Snoop Dogg. And dog dog.
And everybody knows that
Kid and Play are like this.
Dogs of a feather.
Veda, girl, you look like
you just saw a ghost.
I did. It's Sydney.
Hi, Veda.
Heh, hi, Sydney.
I was in the neighborhood
and I decided to stop in
and browse and, um,
tsk,
really congratulate you
on your wedding.
Heh, thanks.
Heh, thanks a lot.
Um, this is my cousin and
business partner, Janelle.
Hi, nice to meet you.
JANELLE: Same here.
You guys have
a lot nice things in here.
VEDA:
Thank you.
I guess I have to buy
something then.
You know what?
Those earrings
we got in last week.
Perfect.
Heh.
They have Sydney written
all over them.
Let's see the Sydney earrings.
Ha, ha.
Heh, good.
That's a bad suit.
Thank you.
Oh, those are cute.
I like those.
Could you, uh, put those
in a box for me, please?
Sure will.
Veda, you know,
I'm really glad
Kid found someone
to love.
He had a really hard time
after we broke up.
It seems like
his management company
is doing really well
and you have
a beautiful shop here.
I'm glad you guys are happy.
I really am.
Could you give him my best,
please?
I sure will. And, um...
I wish you all the best
in DC and
good luck and success
and all that stuff.
And wear these in good health.
I will. I'll do that.
Take that with you. Heh
You take care of yourself.
All right? Bye bye.
All right. Thanks, Sydney.
Wow, heh,
I was wrong about her.
She really was nice.
Yeah.
And her booty
wasn't that big.
[HUMMING]
It's cute.
Who are you?
It's me, Aunt Lucy, Veda.
You just let me in, heh
five minutes ago.
Today?
Yeah, I'm taking some of
Kid's stuff over to our condo.
It's Veda.
Kid's fiancée.
Nobody tells me anything.
Oh.
Damn,
this is heavy.
Stinky.
Stinky. Stinky.
Come on, help us out.
I was playing.
Let me--
Take this.
I can't believe your cousin
is that lazy, Play.
I ain't lazy,
man.
Open the door.
This stuff is heavy.
PLAY:
Hard to believe
he's my cousin.
STINKY:
You won't. Come on.
Oh, he's your cousin,
all right.
[SHRIEKS]
I can deal with this.
This I can deal with.
Since the word got out
I'm getting married,
you wouldn't believe the play
I'm getting from the ladies.
Women that wouldn't
talk to me before.
I don't understand it.
PLAY:
At least act
like you know, man.
Women, that's just
how they're livin'.
Word, Play is right man.
Women are just like cats.
Finicky. When they
want you, they want you.
When you got a girl,
that's when they want you.
Oh, Stinky, what the hell
are you talking about?
Yeah, Stinky, since when did
you become an expert on women?
All you date
are fat girls.
See, that's
where you're wrong.
I don't date just fat girls.
I date skinny girls
on the verge of being fat,
fat girls on the verge
of being obese.
Matter of fact,
I'm dating your sister.
What's she, 380?
I'm taking her
to the slaughterhouse
to eat tonight.
That was unnecessary.
It was, I admit.
But why crush a guy's ego?
Y'all think you're all that.
You think you some kind
of Dark Gable or something, man.
PLAY: Well, suppose I am.
Well, suppose you ain't.
You know I'll pick up
your roster,
and I'm dating one
of your girls tonight.
You recognize 555-12-37?
Give me my beeper, fool.
What was up with you
and Maxine last night, man?
She was like all up
in your grill.
That girl is the bomb.
Heh. Yo.
You said that right.
That girl has the fattest
rump shake. I can't front.
PLAY:
I would've
waxed that ass, man.
I mean, you got
a couple of days.
And I was gonna save it
as surprise.
But through reliable sources,
through to grapevine,
Sydney's back in town.
And I know you wanna wax
that butt one more time.
One more time.
Just tear it up.
Just tear it up, man.
STINKY:
Hey, yo Kid, man, if you need
my crib for anything
to get away from Veda
or to get hold of Sydney,

Look, guys, for the last time,
Sydney is yesterday's news.
I'm committed to Veda. Okay?
Let's go.
You going out.
Next thing you know,

[SIGHS]
Ooh, I know you gonna

Hmm.

[CHUCKLING]
You still shop

Don't you? Ha, ha.
You laugh now that I got a body
of a little boy, right?
But you know what,
I got the power of ten men.
You know what I'm saying.
PLAY: Tell her, cuz.
With them two big donuts
you got right there,
you can feed a starving child
in Somalia for a whole month.
Can I have one?
Please. Your mouth
don't open that big.
Besides, little man,
I'd use you like dental floss
and then I would
throw you away.
Ooh. That's all right.
But nine out of ten
dentists recommend me.
So, what's up?
Let me clean them teeth.
Please.
Let me measure a real man.
Hey, check it out.
Kid's bachelor party

How about you come on down

I'll put them

Hey, don't go there.
Just how much are we
paying for these tuxes?
Hey, we ain't gotta go

Ho, ho, motherfucker,

Check this out.
SHOWBOAT:

Ol' Cujo here is going

AUNT LUCY: Hi!
VEDA: Is everybody ready?
I've got the engine running,
my mother has food on the table,
and we don't wanna keep
my mother waiting.
What a pretty girl.
I should introduce you
to my boy Kid.
Kid, you ought to marry
this girl.
She's much better for you
than that fiancée
you brought here
yesterday.
I mean, that girl
was way too tall for you.
Ha, ha. You're right,
Aunt Lucy.
I am
a better choice.
Oh, yeah, much better
than the girl
that wanted Night Heat
at her party.
Tsk.
Oh, really?
Oh, yeah.
You know the one.
The one that thought
I was still hung up
on the big booty girl,
Sydney.
Ha, ha, I'll bet you she didn't
even make you French toast.
Come on, Aunt Lucy,
let's wait in the car.
Would you hurry up, please?
Where's Uncle Vester?
VESTER: Hey, hey, look.
Hey, woman.
Here we go. Hey.
Ooh, Good Lord, have mercy.
I wanna put you on a plate
with biscuits
and gravy and suck right up.
Whoo.
Aunt Lucy, wait.
That's not my car!
Mm.
You guys come in here.
Where have you guys been?
What took so long?
We just have to go
for our little daily walk.
Yeah, you got to get
that exercise.
Exercise yourself
on in that kitchen.
Get those dishes you left
this morning.
You got no dog
on this one.
Heh. So how do you feel,
boy?
Ah, Uncle Vester,
I'm still a little nervous.
This is such
a big night.
I just don't wanna do anything
that I'll regret.
Oh, son. We gotta talk
about that the other night.
What did I tell you?
Let that go. Be yourself.
We're going over there.
We're gonna be ourselves.
We'll show
you're educated.
Say Diddy hellos,
how to have good time tonight.
You gotta believe that.
Let it go.
Okay. All right.
All right.
You're not packing, are you?
You know I'm blessed.
I'm hung low. Stay out
of my personal business.
Who you with?
Uncle Vester.
Who you with?
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
I'll get it.
Hello!
Hey, yo, what up?
Can I speak to either
Kid or Play?
MARQUES [OVER PHONE]:<i>
No, they ain't here.</i>
This is Butcher
from the catering company.
Is the party still on?
Yeah, the party
is still going on.
Will you tell
Kid or Play that, um,
I ain't serve nobody until
I get the rest of my money.
MARQUES:<i>
I guarantee you your money.</i>
<i> But you got to bring
the food here.</i>
That's 1637 Blast Ave.
Oh, you want me
to bring the food there?
That's right
if you wanna get paid.
Okay. Bye.
Yeah, right.
Veda told me
you're down-home folk.
So I thought we'd have
a little soul food dinner,
something I'd know
you people would like.
I don't care what you serve
long on that occasion.
The food looks great, mom.
Oh, thank you, doll.
Have no plate?
Aunt Lucy, don't worry
about him not having no plate.
I got plenty of food for him.
Uh, Christopher,
I suppose
you haven't made it big
in the music business yet.
Oh, well, dad, uh,
my partner and I--
How did you expect
to support a wife?
And a baby,
you know she pregnant?
Pregnant? Lord have mercy.
See I knew it.
I knew I've been dreaming
about fish.
Fish? Fish, I sure hope
it's catfish.
No, mother.
I am not pregnant, heh.
Young man,
I was asking you a question.
Okay. Uh, well, Dad,
my partner and I,
we're involved in
some very promising ventures.
We have an up and coming
group name, R.A.S. Posse,
that we signed
to Arrest Records.
Now when they release them--
Release, R.A.S. Posse,
What are they, in jail?
Ugh, when they release
their album, mother.
And how do you expect to survive
until this R.A.S. Puss--
Posse makes it big?
In my day,
we used to have a saying:
No romance, heh,
without finance.
Now hold on there, freckles.
You got to have
a little bit more faith
in these young kids today.
Times are different when
you and I were out here
doing our thing. Now hand me
about four or five biscuits.
Oh, I'm hungry.
Oh, Vester.
What is your line
of business?
Unemployment line.
I'm a painter.
I'm an artiste.
Oh, really.
From what school?
Jacob Lord's? Beardon?
Uh, kitchen walls
and sinks, shit like that.
Oh, my God,
crayons and finger paints.
Wait a minute, mom.
You're being unfair.
You and Daddy
didn't have everything
when you first started out.
Yeah.
Yeah. But we worked hard
to get where we are today.
I bet you had whore
just to make ends meet.
I beg your pardon!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I knew,
I knew you.
Dammit to hell, I knew
your face was familiar to me.
Man, back in the days, your wife
just sucked the meanest.
Well, I know you know.
You're the lucky man.
You scum-sucking
son of a bitch!
That's my ho--
My wife you're talking about.
Kid, you're just gonna let them
talk to my parents like this?
I forgot you got other things
on your minds
like getting with Sydney
one more time.
Who said I was getting
with Sydney?
I heard your friend Stinky
talking this morning.
Oh, I don't believe you.
I don't believe Play
is at that window.
Go see what he wants.
AUNT LUCY:
You don't talk
to my nephew like this.
You don't talk

AUNT LUCY:

And you're ready to blow it?
Now, you say you love him.
If you really love him,

trying to embarrass
somebody.
Officers of the goddamn law!
What you wanna do?
I ain't scared of you.

OVER DISPATCHER]
OFFICER:
1637 Blast Avenue.
That disturbance
is now in control.
I'm gonna kill
those little guys.
This is your house?
Uh, yes.
Party's got to stop.
You're disturbing the peace.
Wait the minute.
Hold on, Officer Evans.
Um, my man here, he's getting
married tomorrow.
I'm just trying
to send him off in style.
Um, could you, uh...
Heh, are you married?
Yeah.
Come on, man,
think about it.
The night before
you lost your freedom,
you realized that night,
that's the last night
you gonna be hanging
with your homeys,
chasing after the honeys.
No more nothing, man,
just you,
the TV
and her.
Come on, man.
Come on.
You people
have a nice evening.
Okay.
Come on, man, let's talk.
I have a cousin that's
a marriage counselor.
[♪♪]
I can't believe
those little hard heads
could throw a hyper party
than me and Play.
Oh, heh, wait for me,
Janelle.
Party over here.
[GROANS]
It's 1:00.
Do you know
where your testicles are?
Where's my money?
We spent it.
Look, I'm getting
married tomorrow.
You wouldn't hurt
the family jewels?
Start cutting!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.
Whoa, whoa!
See, now, that's funky.
Now, who is that?
Uh, that's our new group
Immature.
We just signed them.
We were getting ready
to tell you to check them out.
Hey, hey, hey, and the other act
as promised, my brother.
[YELLS]
Sex As A Weapon.
We got a deal?
Yeah. Deal.
Wait. I thought you signed
with Cold-Blood Management.
Since we heard about what
they did to those blind rappers,
we, uh, changed our mind.
That's right.
We can't be doing business
with peoples,
hear me now, like that.
We don't like that.
SEX AS A WEAPON:
Mmm!
Yeah. Mmm!
Uh, okay, girls, go in there
and use those weapons.
Yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.
PLAY:
Oh, that's two groups,
Rowboat.
I guess you owe us now,
huh?
Hook him up.
Yeah, hook me up.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Whoo.
See, man, I told you
I'd take care of everything,
man.
It's the American way.
Look, congratulations,
man.
That's for your honeymoon.
Excuse me boy,
can I have my baby now?
You can have your baby now.
Uh, excuse me.
Hey, Kid, we know, we've been
lots of trouble, so here.
Wow. Thanks a lot.
Unh.
That might be just enough
to clean up
after this bachelor party
of yours.
Hey, cuz.
My 50 percent.
Sure.
Let me get some change, man.
Can anybody
bust up a dollar?
Yo, you wrong, man.
I want my 50 percent, man.
I'll burn this place down,
man.
