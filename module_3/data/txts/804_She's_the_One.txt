Hello, Boss.
Get up. Okay, okay. Bye.
- Did you sleep well?
- Carrie!
Wake up! It's 5:20!
Here's your meds, Gramps.
- Oh, is it?
- I'll just wake up the kids.
Coby!
- You're going already?
- Charlie?
Yeah, I have to go.
Wake up. Good morning.
- Sir, any news?
- Nada.
- I'll try calling his landline.
- Go.
- What? You got him?
- Not yet, sir.
Wacky!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Pray before eating, okay?

He's here! He's here!
Yeah, sorry. Can't talk to you. I'm in
the studio. The show's about to start.
Dummy! It already started! I woke you up
extra early today but you're still late.
Hurry, Charlie's waiting for you.
She won't go to school until she sees you.
Yeah.
Good morning.
All right. Bye, Boss.
Wacky! You're late again! What happened? -

<i>- For Chris...

5h", <i>I</i> gotta go!
<i>Oh, ifs ma'am Cat!</i>
- Wow, Mina! First one today!
- Good morning, ma'am!
- Good morning, ma'am!
- Good morning!
<i>We're here with the successful

- Put these in the dryer next.
- Fumed celebrity fashion blogger,
<i>Ms. Mandy Capicio.
How's your morning so far, Mandy?</i>
<i>Ifs awesome 'cause
I get to be with you.</i>
<i>- Really?
- Just kidding.</i>
<i>You got me, huh.</i>
Sir Wacky is so cute.
Mmm! But who's this bimbo
getting all flirty with him?
<i>- You know what, Mandy?
- Yes?</i>
<i>I noticed we've got matching
colored wardrobe this morning.</i>
<i>- What could that mean?
- Oh yeah! We're both in red!</i>
<i>- That's right!
- We're a match!</i>
<i>Okay! You said it! We're a match.</i>
<i>Do you think we're a good match?
Go to our online poll! Yes or no?</i>
Hey, wash up!
<i>I know you said
no more set ups, but...</i>
Lyn, of all the nights you could pick
to make me look like a fool...
you chose Tarzan's birthday.
I know I made a booboo with Thaddeus...
and Paul, Peter, Jeremiah, Ezekiel...
Who will you
set me up with next? Jesus?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I promise, this time will be different.
Jason is a really nice guy.
Look him up on Facebook.
Check him out in
Mike's company outing photos.
Yes, Cat! Give it a try.
No, thank you. You know I don't have
time for all that internet stuff.
I promise, he's a great guy.
Give him a chance.
Wait. Don't you think Wacky will mind?
You think setting me up
during his party is a good idea?
No! Don't worry about Wacky.
Cat, it's fine.
He's bringing his own date anyway.
<i>Okay? All right, see ya, Cat.</i>
See you.
Hey, stop smiling at me.
I've already moved on from you.
Steve, don't forget to find me...
- a boyfriend.
- Why is this crooked?
Really? Sheesh!
- And here's Cat, the party planner.
- My God.
Acts like a girlfriend,
but not really a girlfriend.
Cat's busy.
Anyway, honey, I miss you!
- Admit it...
- Oh, you.
'Hi! Fiat!
Let's go, dress up!
Oh, no need! It's okay. This is fine.
But this looks better.
- This is from our new collection.
- Why do I need to dress up? He's not...
not Joaquin Rogelio Delos Reyes!
- He's worth it, so change! Now!
- I'll do it. Let me, let me, let me.
- Can you please... Tony, help.
- Take it off!
All right.
- Wait! Give me...
- Take it off!
- Cat, Cat, Cat. One.
- Steve, look! It's a free live show!
<i>Bye, honey! I miss you! Mwah!</i>
- What? What? What?
- It looks good.
My God, wait a second.
My God, dear. Those are gifts from God.
If I hadn't shown these off,
I would not have a boyfriend right now.
So... show them off!
- Hey, hey, hey, wait!
- Jessica's here, Lyn!
- I need to get the cake!
- Hey, lipstick, lipstick, lipstick.
- Jessie, c'mon! Lipstick!
- No way! No! Ah...
- Put it on her!
- Here we go.
- Stop moving.
- C'mon, Cat. Don't cover...
This is for tonight's prince charming.
- Okay. Okay. Mmm...
<i>- Hey!!!</i>
Ah, that's not your prince charming.
- Ancient history.
- Your lipstick's not for him.
<i>Fix your hair Baby Jill.
Your rival is fresh and young.</i>
- Tarzan! Hi! Happy birthday!
- Best friend!
Thank you! Wow!
Looks like you chose to dress up like
a decent human being for my birthday.
Oh, thank you so much.
Do I look that bad all the time, huh?
Oh! Sorry, sorry.
Mandy, I'd already
introduce you to my friends.
And of course my best friend, Cat.
Cat, Mandy.
- Hi! Nice to meet you.
- It's so nice to meet you. I'm Mandy.
Um, why do you call him Tarzan?
Maybe you should ask him.
C'mon, let's eat! Let's eat!
<i>' Okay . Yew!</i>
Jason! It's been a long time.
Thanks for coming.
- Hon!
- Hi, Jason!
Good to see you, guys.
- Good to see you, too.
- Nice to meet you.
Let's eat! Let's eat!
So, what do you do?
I actually manage my own business.
Seriously?
Yeah, but it's just a small
laundry shop actually. It's my parents'.
But when they passed away,
I had to take over the business.
- Last Saturday, we went to this party...
- I'm very sorry to hear that.
No, it's okay. It was a long time ago.
- How much?
- Just a little.
<i>You know, actually,
I don't think you know her...</i>
because she's a fresh graduate.
Anyway...
it was so much fun.
There was this open bar,
and we had jello shots.
- Do you know jello shots?
- That's my favorite.
I know, right? Those were my favorite.
Anyway, everybody got so drunk.
And I was so drunk!
It was not even funny.
<i>- Thank you for caring.
- And this guy right here...</i>
<i>from other company,
which is our competitor.</i>
Oh, wow! So you must be really good!
Is he good?
Boss, don't be such
an eager beaver for Brazilian wax.:)]
- You like chicken?
- I love it.
But when did you move
to the Philippines?
So you and Cat were
partners since college?
Mm-mmm. It's not like I chose to be.
Mike was hounding Lyn.
And Paolo, he was too short to be
her partner and so I ended up with Cat.
I broke three bones with her
as my dance partner. What a pro!
That wasn't my fault!
You're lucky your partner's
so kind to you.
Oh, Lord, yes.
So kind, so willing to be his project
partner, lab partner, business partner.
- Every kind of partner.
- Correct! Every kind of partner except...
romantic partner!
- I may be kind, but I'm not stupid.
- Award!
I may be stupid
but I'm not that kind to date her.
The two of you are so cute.
You never really became a couple?
<i>As in ever?</i>
- No!
- Never.
Never ever.
- As in ever?
- No.
<i>Never, never ever. Ever, ever.</i>
- Never ever.
- Never ever.
- But then, six years ago...
- Here we go.
' Okay! . Tony...
' stop it! <i>'</i> Tony...
When we all thought Wacky
was moving to the U.S. indefinitely...
after our last night
drinking together...
Wacky and Cat played tonsil hockey.
. No! No. No<i>'</i> Ok! -No!
- Oh my gosh!
- Correction! He... He kissed me.
No, excuse me! I didn't kiss you!
- You're such a liar! Liar!
- What?
- This is embarrassing!
- Easy! Easy!
I'm the most respected
morning show host in this country.
- I never kissed you!
- Just admit it!
Fine! Let's do it for real now!
Stop it!
Okay. This is what happened.
I did not kiss him. He kissed me,
but he claims he doesn't remember...
I don't remember because
it never happened. Period.
- You're such a liar!
- Oh geez!
Okay, let's stop
talking about this. Sorry.
It's going to be Wacky's birthday
in five minutes so let's make a wish.
I'll go first.
Please! Please, me first.
I wish, on your next birthday
we'll still be together.
Oh. Wow.
My turn. Wacks, now that you're thirty
I wish you'd stop fooling around.
Because you've made
at least thirty girls cry.
More than thirty for sure.
More than that.
MY gosh!
Hey, isn't it my birthday? You talk
as if I'm such a douche. Be nice to me!
You're not a douche, just scum.
Jason, why don't you greet me
on my birthday?
Because, you know, my friends...
These friends of mine, they're so bad!
In Portuguese, please... like I'm not aware
that you're badmouthing me already.
What does that mean?
I hope he falls in love
with a wonderful woman...
the way I'm in love
with someone really special.
Oh! He's in love with Cat.
So, you're in love?
Yeah! Her name is Amy and I met her
in a speed dating event last week.
- I thought Jason was single.
- That's so romantic!
That's what I thought too!
Huh? I don't get it.
- Is this...? I'm so sorry.
- No! No it's okay. Don't worry.
It's just a simple dinner
for my best friend. It's for Wacky.
- Yes!
- Yeah! For my birthday!
<i>You know, Cat, you're beautiful.</i>
I'm sure it won't be hard for you
to find the right guy.
Don't worry! It's fine.
Okay? It's okay.
Of course, we'll make sure of it.
Right, best friend?
That's why my birthday wish
is for you to just find a good guy...
Shut up! What?
This a pity party for me now?
- No, I'm kidding...
- Make a wish for yourself.
- Don't waste it on me.
- All right. Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I wish for you to find a boyfriend.
- Yeah!
- No, but seriously...
I wish that... Um...
That... That nothing would change.
Happy birthday, Wacky!
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday to me!
We love you, Wacky...
Uh, miss, do you need help?
No, it's okay. I'm almost done. Thanks.
Are you sure? Wait, I'll...
No, no. It's okay.
I'm fine. I'm done now.
Oh, okay. You're sure.
Yes. Thank you.
Boss!
You got me! Wow!
For you. To make you feel better?
Feel better from what?
From being dumped by Jason even before
you could start making a move on him.
- Mm-hmm! Wiseass!
- Ouch!
So, what happened to your date?
Nothing. She was an airhead.
So, I took her home.
Wow! I'm sure some sex happened between
the dinner and taking her home.
Some.
- Perv! You're such a jerk!
- What? What can I do?
Your friend...
Your friend is irresistible!
- Ha ha ha! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Feet down.
- Oh.
Ew.
Who's that? Your precious Mandy again?
No! Different girl. Listen, listen.
Happy birthday, Wacky. Do you wanna
celebrate your birthday on my bed?
So pervy! Another Mandy, huh.
- Like Mandy?
- Oh, so so drunk!
- Perv, perv, perv!
- Mandy, huh.
You really are such a Tarzan.
Girls are like vines you swing from.
There's always an old one
to let go of...
Tree vine?
And a new one to grab onto.
You're such a player!
That's what you call "dating", Cat.
- Dating. Dating, okay?
- No. That is what you call...
you can't handle being alone.
- No.
- And that's why...
you always spend your birthdays here,
in my house.
There you go again.
- What? It's true.
- No. Look. Mmm.
<i>- Just watch your favorite movie. Look!
- Don't change the sub/eat.</i>
<i>I need to tell you something.</i>
Tarzan, what you're doing with your life
will result in you being alone.
And you will become
that dirty old geezer in bars...
that every young girl
would be disgusted with.
- It's your favorite line in the movie.
- Believe me. Oh, you're not listening.
- I'm telling the truth.
- You know...
the problem with you is you give me
more sermons than a priest. Really!
Thank God, you did
not become my girlfriend.
- Otherwise, I would have left you.
- I wouldn't have agreed to it anyway.
You're thickheaded, selfish,
irresponsible. No, thank you.
Okay, okay, okay.
You insult me, as if you're...
I know. I don't fit your standards.
There isn't a person any person alive
who can fit your standards.
- Your standards are impossible.
- Hey, Jason...
Jason fit perfectly. Nothing but net.
Maybe he did, but that's Amy's net.
Amy's net! I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- Yeah, right.
- Not yours.
Because you were dumped! Weren't you?
- Ass.
- No. No, but seriously...
You have my word. I'm going to do
what I promised you on my birthday.
That I'll find you a boyfriend.
I promise. I will do it.
The right guy will come
at the right time.
Right time. But...
If that guy does come along and it still
doesn't work out, if you're not a match...
even if it's hard,
even if it's against my will...
even if I hate it,
I will try to be good for you.
I'll be your boyfriend.
Fine. I will try
to be stupid too, for you.
If I have no other choice,
I'll be your girlfriend.
There you 9°!
I'm... I'm really lucky
that you're my best friend.
You really are.
<i>I love you, guys!</i>
<i>- All right!
- I'm gonna miss Wacky!</i>
Hey, did you guys break up already?
- What?
- Break up?
Long distance relationships don't work.
Hello, only couples can break up.
And we're not a couple!
- Really?
- After all this time, still no?
But you're sweeter to each other
than these married folks here.
That's not true.
That's why.
That's why she's not my girlfriend.
So that we don't have to break up.
Right? Right?
Is that so?
'Cause, you know... love ends,
but friendship is forever!
<i>- That's right!</i>
- <i>It's</i> true!
That's why no matter where I am...
- What am I gonna do there? Nothing!
- You need to go there because...
- your step dad offered you...
- It's cold there.
- A pretty good job, right?
- I don't like it.
- I don't like it. I want to party...
- Plus, you'll get to bond...
- with your mom again.
- But she left me, Cat. Remember?
She even said I was nothing
but a waste of space, so screw her.
She doesn't love me.
You? Do you love me?
'Cause I... I love you.
Uh, Wacks, you're drunk.
Cat, he's your best friend.
Stop it, Cat.
This won't go well.
Wacky...
Wacky...
Geez, your hands are so coarse.
What have you been doing?
- From washing your dirty laundry. Stupid.
- A callus here. And here.
No, seriously. Promise me...
Promise me, okay? Whatever happens...
we will be friends forever.
I will be the one guy
who never breaks up with you...
and you will be that one girl
who will never break up with me.
Deal.
- Yeah! That's a deal.
- Ah! Ah, no!
- Tarzan, happy birthday!
- Thank you. Here.
<i>What's up, guys? You know what?
I'm not really into posting my own videos.</i>
<i>I don't do this...
but something weird is going on.</i>
<i>So, I met this girl and for some reason,
like... I can't keep her off my mind.</i>
<i>Like, I think she's the one.</i>
<i>There's just something different
about her, you know?</i>
<i>Something special.</i>
<i>But the problem is...</i>
<i>I don? Know her name...</i>
<i>I don? Have her number.</i>
<i>No information whatsoever.
As in, none!</i>
<i>I don'! Know why... Why I...</i>
<i>When I saw her, I just froze, like...</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do.
What was I supposed to do?</i>
<i>She was so hot, right? Like... Ugh.</i>
<i>The only thing I managed to get
is this video.</i>
<i>I need your help to find this girl.</i>
<i>I need to find this... amazing...
beautiful girl.</i>
<i>So, if any information about her.
If you know her...</i>
<i>or if you might have
seen her somewhere, message me.</i>
<i>And for the girl in the rain...
if you're watching this...</i>
<i>Fm David.</i>
<i>And Fm not gonna stop...</i>
<i>until I find you.</i>
- He's so cute and sweet.
- What? What did he say?
Sweet? That's sweet? That's so cheesy. -
Okay, so how should I tell him that I'm...
- Good morning, guys!
- Good morning!
Hello, Ma'am Judith.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but as you know...
Get Going, Philippines' ratings have been
declining over the last couple of months.
- <i>We're reformatting.
- Management, myself included...</i>
<i>have decided that
it's time for change.</i>
We have decided that GGP
will undergo reformatting...
- I <i>knew it.
- In the next eight weeks.</i>
With that said I would like
to assure you...
that we're going to try to retain
as many of you as possible.
But, of course, due to the changes
it's unavoidable that...
some of you may have to be let go.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay
I'm sure they will
give you another show.
What?
Yeah. It's okay.
The reformat, so the status
of who stays and who goes...
depends on your performance
over the next eight weeks.
Any questions?
Okay, then let's go back to work.
Wacky, can I have a word
with you in private, please?
Sure.
GGP's going to be reformatted.
So?
So... It looks like
I won't be a part of it.
Huh?
Judith said I'm not good enough.
That I need to give more effort.
- That I need to...
- What do you expect?
- You show up late everyday...
- Everyday?
- Hey, that's not true.
- Sometimes, you come in with a hangover.
- Okay? What else?
- You keep flirting with guests...
- They flirt with me!
- And then...
Wait, wait a minute.
I thought you were my friend?
- Shouldn't you be on my side?
- I am your friend.
That's why I need
to tell you the truth.
You know what your problem is?
You can't handle hard work.
You want everything to be easy.
So what? You're just giving up?
You can do it.
You can do it. I know you.
- C'mon...
- Hey... Okay, okay.
Give me a smile!
- You're the one who dragged me here.
- Okay. Fine. Okay...
- Smile...
- Stop it.
Yuck! Gross!
- That stinks... That really stinks!
- C'mon. No, it smells good.
- It smells fine.
- But at least you're smiling.
He's smiling again!
Gramma, I'm with Wacky.
- He's so cute.
- Hey, hey, hey.
<i>Don't get your panties
wet over that kid.</i>
Is it Christmas? Is he for sale?
- Admit it, your panties got wet too.
- Wait, wait.
- Fine.
- I'm sorry, but I'm telling you.
The way that boy stares
makes my heart melt. I'm so sorry.
- Right?
- You've got the hots for a kid.
You're such a cougar, Mama Bing.
Oh, yeah. Just get me wet under the rain,
I will transform into the girl in the rain.
- Let's see it.
<i>- Pour</i> water on her!
Lemme see.
One million.
One million hits in six days?
- <i>Yes.
- That kid is more popular than us.</i>
With little effort, he got
the whole country talking about him.
But us, no matter what kind of gimmick
we do on our show, nobody's watching.
Good morning!
<i>Positions! Victor; Get out of there!
Out! Move it!</i>
<i>And rolling! Five, four, three, two...</i>
Get Going, Philippines!
- David!
- What's up, guys?
Yeah, that's him. That's him.
'Kay! Let's go!
- Wacky is right here.
- David.
- Uh, hi.
- Wacky.
Whazzup, bro?
Oh. Yeah. What's up? Have a seat.
Have a seat. Please, please.
It's a fact, that Filipinos
are suckers for romance.
I'm telling you,
this will click with our viewers.
So, what are you trying to say?
I will help you look
for the girl in the rain. Okay?
I will guest you in my show,
and because of that,
you'll get greater media exposure.
It will be easier for you
to reach out to the girl.
And of course,
the people will eat it up.
- Right?
- David.
So in that case, I get my viewers.
You get your girl.
- How about that? How about that?
- It's done! I like it!
- Cool!
- David. David.
- Hi, Penggoy!
- Oh! Dude, what's up?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I finished editing our report.
Ah, the report?
- Yes.
- Uh, yeah.
That's not important right now.
The important is... Listen up.
I'm one step closer to finding
the girl in the rain!
- Dude, awesome, right?
- Yeah. Congrats.
Wait. Couldn't she be
your girl in the rain?
- Gillian?
- Isn't it her?
Her? Are you kidding?
She's my best friend!
- Oh, is that so? Really?
- Geez!
Dude, by the way, Wacky's gonna help me
find the girl in the rain. Right?
Yes, and once we find her, we will air
your first meeting live on the show.
Cool, right? What do you think?
You know, your video has
a million hits on YouTube now.
If that girl really wanted to be found she
would have contacted you by now, Penggoy.
Penggoy? Why Penggoy?
- I was ah... Okay. Okay.
- Penguin boy...
Penguin boy! I like that. Huh?
I was a fat kid who walked funny
and she beat up all the bullies.
- So, so fat! Fat, fat!
- Okay! Okay!
Anyway, the point is, maybe you guys
are just meant to meet only once...
because maybe once you meet her,
you might get disappointed...
that she's not how you imagine her.
You know, if you love someone,
you can accept anything about the person.
And because of that,
you'll never be disappointed. Hm?
And if you really love the person,
you'll do anything for her. Right?
- Right. Right.
- Correct? So what?
Good morning!
Uncle Wacky!!!
What's that?
- Oh, you're here.
- Look at this. Carrie's crush.
- I've met your crush!
- Hey! Hey! What are you...
Hey, hey. Stop it with the crushes.
You're just a kid.
Best friend, this girl.
This girl is going to save my life.
Another girl.
What are you doing here anyway?
She's gonna be my savior.
Look at the number of hits.
It's gone viral.
Imagine the show's ratings...
if I can get David and
the mystery girl in the rain to meet.
They'd be stupid not to retain me
in the new show, right?
That's impossible.
Don't be so negative, it will work.
It will be a hit.
You just can't see it yet,
but it will work.
No it won't because of you
do somehow find the mystery girl...
you're going to bang her
even before they get to meet.
Well, if it doesn't work out
with him, why not?
You're so disgusting, Joaquin!
- What?
- Alma, coffee for Wacky, please!
I got it.
<i>You really believe
you're going to find this girl, huh.</i>
Of course.
You never know, she might be
just around the corner, right?
- Uh-huh!
- She's just next to Uncle Wacky.
Yeah! Yeah! Just good vibes!
You, you have no faith in me.
I will find David's lucky girl. Right?
You found her.
That's what I'm talking about!
Moral support.
You need to be more like her.
- Where can I find her?
- Right beside you.
<i>What do you mean, Charlie?</i>
There.
What have you been watching?
That's impossible.
How can I be the girl in the video.
That can't be me, right?
That's you.
- Wohohoa... It's you! You!
- No. No! That's impossible!
- How can I be the...
- Wait. Wait a minute! Wait! It's you!
- That's not me!
- That's you... That's Cat?
You're the girl in the rain!

- You!
- You said you're going to bang me!
So sweet! David will finally meet her!
Forget about that!
Forget it! But... Whoo!
You... It's you! Wait...
Okay, wait wait wait wait wait wait.
Cat, this is going to be big.
This is so important for me.
- Joaquin...
- Cat...
- We're best friends, aren't we?
- Oh, don't get started with that.
- Cat, Cat. Hey, please.
- No.
- Please, please, please.
- It is Cat!
No. I don't wanna!
No Way! No Way! No Way! No, no!
- Boss!
- No!
David Esguerra, believes
he will meet, "Girl in the Rain".
Hm. I just hope the Girl in the Rain
does show up.
<i>Because if she won't, don't even expect
to be included on the reformat. Okay?</i>
No.
Good morning!
- Pancakes, your favorite.
- No.
<i>So, our dear viewers...</i>
<i>if you have any information about the
girl who makes David's heart beat.</i>
<i>The girl who makes his mornings
beautiful. Please, let him know, okay?</i>
- Big sister! Please!
- No!
- Please!
- No!
- Boss... Please...
- No!
Okay. 180 yards.
I will hit the ball. And if I do it,
you will agree to meet David.
Challenge accepted.
From Jessie.
He's too young. No matter
how many tweets you show me...
if I'm gonna look like a pedophile,
no thank you.
You cheated!
Woo! Woo! You lose! You lose!
- Loser! Loser!
- You screamed. That doesn't count.
<i>- Boss!</i>
- No. Sheesh!
<i>C'mon! Please!</i>
Move!

- Hang these.
- Final answer?

Tweet! Text! Everyone answers 'Yes"!
' Okay? ' Yes! Yes!
Do you want David
and the "Girl in the Rain" to meet?]
<i>Yes!</i>
Please, I...
I really need this for my job.
Just say yes, and I will never ask you
to wash my laundry again.
Stand up!
Agree to meet David and I will
personally deliver all these clothes.
I will even do the laundry! All of it!
Okay. Fine.
- I will think about it.
- You'll think about it...
- Yes.
- Yes?
- Yes. I'll think about it. Ah! Ah! Wait!
- You heard that!
- Yes! No!
- I said I'll think about it.
- You already said yes.
- I will think about it.
Okay, I'll think about it.
- Done!
- Dummy!
Okay? You said yes!
You said yes! You said yes!
Whoo! Yeah!
Dude! Dude! Dude, she said yes!
- What?
- She said yes! Whoo!
Dude, she said yes! Yes!
Wacky just called me. And guess what?
The Girl in the Rain agreed to meet me!
Finally, right? Woohoohoo! Yeah!
Sis! Why are you here?
Don't you need to go to GGP?
Go, go. Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Boss, why aren't you answering?
Where are you?]
- <i>Wacky,</i> is <i>she there yet?
- Don't worry about it.</i>
<i>We're going 10 be number one
after this I'm sure of H.</i>
Have some faith in me.
I will pull it off.
- Just make sure this works.
- Got it.
- Okay.
- I will show him to my classmates!
Big sis, please? He's so cute!
- He's our super crush.
- Well, he's not my crush.
Thank you. Thank you.
<i>Rise and shine, David!</i>
<i>Rise and shine, Wacky! Guys!
Rise and shine to all of you!</i>
<i>Wow!
You seem very happy this morning!</i>
<i>It's because I will meet
the Girl in the Rain!</i>
<i>Guys, you helped me
find the girl of my dreams!</i>
<i>All I can say is...</i>
<i>It's destiny, man.</i>
<i>- It's destiny.
- Destiny! Okay! Destiny!</i>
<i>You heard that, Girl in the Rain.
So, where are you?</i>
<i>Don'! Lei us down. Don'! Lei David down.
We're just right here waiting for you.</i>
<i>- Hurry up!
- Where are you?</i>
<i>You know what?
She's probably stuck in traffic.</i>
Gosh, you think she'll show up?
- She said she'll show up, right?
- No. Knowing her, no.
<i>We're all waiting for the Girl in the Rain.
But how are you? How are you feeling?</i>
- <i>You won't</i> be late.
<i>- Actually, I'm kinda nervous.</i>
<i>But I know she'll be here.</i>
<i>- I just know it.
- Okay, okay.</i>
Oh my God! He's so cute!
Mmm! Come out, Cat!
Please! Come out now!
- Ma'am Cat, why are you here?
- Yeah, Ma'am Cat.
Shouldn't you be in GGP now?
Dude, bro, thank you.
If it wasn't for you,
I would never get this chance.
No problem, no problem.
Just relax. We're still in the last gap.
All right, all right. Thanks!
Do you really need this?
She's not coming.
She'll be there, Gramma!
But you know, some people are saying,
all of this is a practical joke.
That the girl in the rain is fake.
What can you say about that?
No. She's real. I saw her.
I talked to her.
And I truly fell in love with her.
Boom!
Guys, she's here!
The girl in the rain! She came!
She's finally here!
The girl in the rain! Cat Aguinaldo!
She showed up!
Come on. Guys! Position!
Now! Let's go!
Let's go!
I prepared something for you.
Promise, you're gonna like this.
- All right?
- Okay.
March!!!
<i>Who is that girl under the rain now?</i>
<i>Who is that girl
under the rain now? Who?</i>
Before I met you...
I was exactly like them.
Lifeless... without a heartbeat.
But then I met you.
Clear!
Clear! Breathe!
Move!
Clear! Breathe!
Move!
<i>Clear! Breathe!</i>
- That's how you dance!
- Not like that!
- Oh my god!
- You got the moves! Let's go, David!
Hey!
Guys, give me a beat!
David and
'Girl in the Rain' finally meetl]
Wow, you're here.
As in you're actually here!
This is so cool.
You're so hot!
David, right?
I'm happy I finally met you but...
I'm sorry. I have to go.
Wait. We haven't even talked yet.
No, I have to get to work.
- Right, Wacks?
- Mm-mmm.
Is that so?
Well, can I have your number?
L.G.? Twitter? F.B.? Anything?
Is it okay?
I'm sorry. I don't have those.
She's technologically challenged.
Whatever.
David, look.
Thank you for everything
you've done for me...
but, David, you're too young for me.
You're twenty. I'm twenty-eight.
How will that work?
The only way it won't work
is if we don't even try.
I mean, so what if you're
a little older than me? I don't care!
Just give me a chance. Please?
I'm sure once you get to know me,
you'll see that I'm more than just a boy.
I'm more of a man
than most men out there.
<i>Man enough to say I like you.</i>
<i>Yes, I really like you.</i>
So, please... just one date.
David, I really can't. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
So, she's your best friend.
Why didn't you go for her?
Why would I?
Congratulations, everybody!
CatVid is a success!
We have to strike while the iron's hot.
People are clamoring for CatVid!
That's going to be a problem.
Cat already declined.
Then what's the use
of being her best friend?
Convince her!
You need to make her
agree to date David.
It's not that easy. You don't know her.
Wacky, this will really help
in GGP'S ratings.
And I'm sure you want
to help the show, right?
So, are you going to help me or not?
- Let's eat.
- No. Sit down.
C'mon Mike bring in the barbecue.
- C'mon. Let's eat. Let's eat.
- Yehey!
Bad trip! I really need this.
It's your needs again.
It's for you again.
It's about you again.
Me, have you ever thought
about what I want?
You're so selfish.
You act like dating this guy
is a death sentence!
You should even be
thanking me for this.
Shit, Wacky, I'm not that desperate.
Well, I think dating this boy
is exactly what you need.
Right? Exactly! Right?
<i>You need to fall in love with someone
who's already in love with you.</i>
What I mean is,
the guys I set you up with...
They can fall in love.
But this boy, for the first time,
is already in love.
Wow! Cat, you've got nothing to lose.
- Give it a chance. Go!
<i>- Do</i> you actually agree <i>with</i> him <i>?</i>
Seriously, okay?
Why don't you just date this guy?
I don't want to be branded a cougar.
Please! You're not a cougar.
Just a Puma.
What's that?
Prefers Underage M An.
And Cat... Cat, don't you want to be
promoted to a real girlfriend status?
<i>Are you going to be Wacky's
pretend girlfriend forever?</i>
Maybe the reason why
you don't want to date David is...
because you enjoy
being Wacky's pretend girlfriend.
Or maybe you're waiting for Joaquin
to get his act together
so he can pass your standards...
then he'll finally stop being your
pretend boyfriend and make it real.
Long shot! Cheers!
You really know how to
kill the mood, huh? Tactless?
Well, I don't know what to say.
So, Cat...
Is it true?
So is it about me huh?
Just tell me.
C'mon. Really.
- What?
- Yeah, you.
You're the reason for all of this.
Because my world revolves
around you, right?
I don't know howl can date
a 20-year old boy because...
how will I ever fit him in my schedule?
When all my time is already dedicated
to wiping your ass.
- Really?
- I'll go ahead.
- Cat...
- No. I'm okay.
- Wait a minute.
- Girl... Girl, girl, girl.
- Did I ever ask you to take care of me?
- It's your fault.
Did I ever ask you
to live your life around mine?
Tell me, did I ever?
All of this falls on you.
Maybe you're right.
It's my fault...
I was stupid enough to be your friend.
Wow. Okay. Wait. You talk as if
I'm the worst friend in the world.
Why? It's been the same ever since
we became best friends, hasn't it?
I keep taking care of you...
cleaning up after you
while you enjoy your carefree life.
I never forced you
to do anything for me.
Look, come on. Don't be unfair here.
I know, that's why
I'm saying it is my fault.
So it's over. I'm done.
So stop asking me
to fix your own damn problem.
Thank God you two
did not become a couple.
- Thank God, all right.
- Thank God, all right.
'Cause I don't wanna end up with
someone who has standards so high...
that I10 one can éVél' meet.
Look, do you know why you're alone?
<i>Ifs because no one
is good enough for you.</i>
No one can ever be good enough for you.
You are miserable
because of your own doing.
<i>Wackymthafs enough.</i>
<i>- Wacky.
- Well, ifs true.</i>
You keep looking for something wrong
with all the guys you date.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe
it's not them who's wrong for you.
You are wrong for them.
You're an asshole, Wacky.
A real asshole.
- Cat...
- I think this is a break-up, guys.
Cat...
You know, Pao, you have to learn
to shut up your mouth.
<i>Boys, just talk to Wacky.</i>
Because I love you.
Wacks, Wacks, you're drunk.
Stop it, Cat.
He's your best friend.
This won't go well.
<i>He's the most stupid guy in the world.</i>
<i>Cat, finally you're here.
Help Wacky to pack his suitcases...</i>
<i>- Tarzan...
- Yeah.</i>
About last night...
Last night was crazy, huh?
My head was throbbing
when I woke up.
What a hangover.
I don't even know howl got home.
I took you home, remember?
Really?
I thought, maybe, Mike did.
I did.
Thank you.
Sorry for forgetting. I really
don't remember a lot about last night.
Thanks for taking me home.
And then you kissed me.
I kissed you?
Hey! Best friend, really?
<i>Maybe you're the one who's drunk.</i>
- What are you saying?
- You kissed me.
But why would I kiss you? Why?
You know I was drunk.
It would have been fine
if you just didn't remember.
But don't act so disgusted by it.
Cat...
Cat, you asked me
and I'm just giving you an answer.
What the hell? I'm about to leave.
I'm so glad you're leaving.
'Cause you're a worthless friend.
- Guys, what's happening?
- Talk to your friend here.
- He's a liar.
- A liar? I really don't remember.
How can I admit to kissing you
when I have no memory of it?
And if it did happen,
it didn't mean anything.
<i>You told me so many times that
you've accepted being just his friend.</i>
<i>You even said he's not
the guy who's right for you.</i>
But Cat, you never really let go.
You tell me you're looking for
a responsible, faithful, and kind man.
Everything that Wacky is not.
But I think this is
what you hope Wacky could be.
You keep believing he will change.
But, Cat, what if he doesn't?
What if he doesn't want to change?
But don't get me wrong. I mean,
I love Wacky. He's my friend, too.
Like you, I've seen how good he can be.
I remember he organized a surprise
debut for you after your dad died.
Then he came home from the U.S.
when your mom died.
Because he wanted to be by your side.
This was even after
you fought about the kiss.
He has his moments but...
I think you're holding on to moments.
You're holding on to your idea
of who you want Wacky to be.
You should move on.
And let go for real this time.

Please, Big Sis, take us with you?
Please?
For the last time, kids can't go there.
C'mon, finish your food.
Then can't David just go here instead?
I want him to teach me
his stepping moves. Like this.
- He's so cool...
- Sheesh, kids.
You can't go.
That's final. Finish eating. Hurry.
Uncle Wacky!
- How are you?
- Hi Uncle Wacky!
- Good morning.
- Uncle Wacky, Cat won't let us...
- go with her on her date.
- Good morning, Wacky.
Oh wow! Another present.
Why? Where's her date going to be?
I'm sure you know.
Uncle Wacky,
aren't you going with Big Sis?
Of course, he is. It's his job.
Alma, please set a plate for Wacky.
Wacky, I'll leave it to you.
Gotta get to work.
Gramps, I'll go ahead.
- <i>Bye Gramme.
- Okay, take care.</i>
Bye, Charlie. Bye Wacks.
Go ahead. Excuse me.
Cat...
About...
About what I said last night...
Sorry.
- It's fine.
- No, seriously.
I was completely out of line.
I mean, I was such an ass and I mean,
if you don't want to date David...
I won't force you to.
You don't have to do it for me.
Wacky, I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for myself.
Because maybe you're right.
Maybe it's my fault because
I keep looking for flaws.
That's why instead of thinking
that David is too young for me...
maybe him being too young
is a good thing.
Okay.
So, we're okay?
Forget about it.
If you want, I can pick you up later
so we can go there together?
No need.
It's one reason why we're seen
as pretend lovers.
Sure?
Wacky, don't worry. I'll be there.
Bro, thank you again.
This is all on you. Thank you so much.
No, it's on the network.
Order anything you want huh?
- Okay, cheers.
- Cheers. Cheers.
Wow.
You look so amazing.
I promise you'll enjoy, okay?
So? You wanna dance?
Come on. Let's dance!
Let's go! Let's go!
There.
All right. Can I see?
Nice. Thanks. One more, okay?
Give me a smile. Okay?
Go. One more. One, two, three...
Yeah...
Okay, let's do one more later.
But now, we dance.
Let's go.
Hey, are you okay? What's up? Huh?
No, really?
Is there something wrong?
I just wanted to speak to you
but it's too noisy.
Huh?
The noise.
Ah.
Come on. Follow me. Come on.
Where?
Just trust me, okay?
C'mon.
Wait here. Don't follow us.
Welcome to the VIP.
Let's go here. Come on.
Let's chill.
So? Better? Huh?
I'm sorry.
- Why?
- I'm just not used to this.
Is it the crowd?
We can go somewhere else.
I know this place...
It's not that. What I mean
is I'm not used to dating.
Huh? I thought your friends
set you up lots of times?
Those weren't real dates.
They were group dates.
And they never really panned out.
Never passed the first meeting.
What? They never called back?
More like I didn't.
Well... I don't really have
the time to date around.
I've got a lot on my plate.
I have a family. I have a business.
You know?
So, uh...
So, I'm special.
At least,
I got passed the first meeting.
I didn't want to date you at first.
Huh?
'Cause you're too young.
You might not understand
my responsibility to my family.
And I don't have
the time to fall in love.
Okay...
The truth?
I'm scared of getting hurt again.
I already got hurt once.
I fell in love with one guy.
And I loved him for a long, longtime.
There.
That's why I'm here.
I guess, I want to move on...
maybe give myself a chance.
Does that make sense? I don't know.
Awkward.
I even involved you in this. Sorry.
- I can't believe I'm telling you this...
- Cat, Cat...
Listen.
You are amazing.
All right?
Look, whoever that guy is...
he's stupid.
Don't worry, okay?
I'll help you move on.
And who knows?
Maybe...
You'll fall in love with me.
<i>Baby, tell me you have no doubt.</i>
<i>- Trust in me and I'll go all out</i>
- <i>Hey, hey...</i>
- Just relax, okay? Just enjoy. All right?
- 'Cause <i>it's</i> only you.
- Only you.
- Just feel the music. Come on.
- Right. Left.
<i>- Even if the world ends today.</i>
<i>My love for you will go all the way

- Hello? Yeah, sorry...

I have a date with David.]
<i>You are my only dream.</i>
<i>You are my royal queen.</i>
<i>You're everything I hoped for.</i>
Go! Faster! Faster!
Oh, my God! I'm losing!
Good morning!
Right, right, right...
Uncle Wacky, I didn't see you there.
Hi!
<i>Only you.</i>
<i>Only you.</i>
<i>Woah.</i>
<i>- I</i> can't keep my eyes off <i>of you</i>
<i>With you, my wish came true.</i>
<i>Your kiss is enough for me.</i>
<i>- It's the only thing I need</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>
<i>Oh woah oh woah.</i>
<i>I won? Miss the chance.</i>
<i>In your arms.</i>
<i>- You</i> make my <i>wanna</i> dance.
- Okay. Okay. I can do it.
<i>I will never let you go</i>

Boss?
Yes, this is your boss. Get up because
I can't afford you being late again.
<i>- Just put your trust in me</i>
- Okay.
<i>It's only you.</i>
<i>Only you oh woah.</i>
Hurry up. Here.
<i>Baby, tell me you have no doubt.</i>
- Trust <i>in</i> me and <i>I'll</i> go all out.
- One more, one more.
<i>'Cause ifs only you.</i>
<i>Only you.</i>
<i>Even if the world ends today</i>
<i>My love for you will go all the way.</i>
<i>Only you.</i>
<i>Only you.</i>
<i>They look so in love.</i>
<i>They are now
a social media phenomenon.</i>
How about you, Wacky?
How does it feel knowing that
you're the cupid who got them together?
I'm happy for them.
I'm really, really happy for them.
<i>I brought Mary Anne with me
because we're now a couple.</i>
You know, man, it's like
she's forgotten she has a best friend.
Ever since she started dating David,
she hasn't had time for me.
What's that?
How old are you?
You're like a jealous little kid.
Idiot. I'm not jealous.
Who said I was jealous?
All these empty bottles do.
You love Cat.
You love her. Just admit it.
It will make things easier for you.
How will it make things easier?
Bro, the last time I tried to show her
howl really feel, we ended up fighting.
Wait, wait, wait. When was this?
No way.
So, it's true.
You kissed Cat.
But why lie about this?
Why do you keep denying it?
Because she doesn't want me.
She said so herself.
She even said she's not stupid enough
to have a relationship with me.
Right?
You know, bro, I sometimes think...
it would be so much easier if I just
accept the fact that we're just friends.
Like... treat her
like nothing but a best friend.
Because, man, she's not just any girl.
She's Cat.
I mean, what if...
what if... let's say...
she becomes my girlfriend?
Let's just say.
Bro, I don't want to hurt her.
I don't want to lose Cat, bro.
So then make sure you don't hurt her.
You have to do something.
Like what?
What... what can I do to top everything
that kid has done for her?
Why? Is he the only one with the moves?
Is he the only one
with back up dancers?
Five, six, seven, eight!
And double time!
Wacky!
Give me a beat!
Wacky. Wacky. Wacky. Wacky.
Lezz go home, please.
I need to go home.
Lyn is looking for me.
Okay. So, tomorrow then?
- Ah! I'm so tired.
- Tomorrow again?
Tomorrow morning. Please.
Thanks.
And thanks for all the gifts
you got for my siblings.
You didn't have to get them anything.
It's okay.
Besides, I don't have any siblings.
And I'm happy whenever
I make your loved ones happy.
I hope I make you happy.
Of course, you do.
I want to make you happier, Cat.
I love you.
And if it's okay with you,
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
- As in "okay"?
- Okay.
Oh my God.
I love you so much!
Mike and I can pick you up tomorrow.
Oh!
Guys!
I'm so sorry but guess what?!
We're now a couple! Woo!
Oh, really?
Right, Cat?
Yeah.
Bro, thank you. If not for you,
this wouldn't be possible.
Congrats!
These are my friends.
- Tony. Mike, Pao.
- Oh, hi.
- This is David.
- David.
- Naive.
- What's with the get-up?
Actually, we're just leaving.
- We just passed by to ah...
- Oh, okay.
- Um, dude, your car can you...
- We'll move it.
Oh, yeah. Sure. Okay.
Bye!
What do you mean "bye"? You're home.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
They're just girlfriend-boyfriend.
They're not married yet.
You still have a chance!
Don't be so glum, Wacks.
C'mon, Wacks.
Even couples about to get married,
before they say "I do",
<i>the priest asks if anyone objects.</i>
She looked happy, huh?
She looked really happy, right?
Actually.
So you're giving up?
I'm giving her what she needs.
And that is for me to be
a best friend to her.
So, I'm just going to support her.
Smile, you lovely couple!
This is for your online fans.
I'll tag everyone, okay?
Hashtag inseparable.
Tag both of us as well.
Wow. Tag. Someone has Twitter.
Cat's updated.
Yeah.
Oh anybody care for dessert?
Uh, no thanks.
How about you, mommy-to-be?
Well, absolutely! But in a bit, okay?
Wait. Gotta go to the restroom.
Okay.
I'll be back, Pretty.
Okay.
Stop it.
Pretty? He calls you "Pretty"?
I'm gonna hit you.
It wasn't my idea.
He just started doing it. Sorry.
But wait.
Do we look good together? Not weird?
Is it okay?
Cat, it's fine! It's not weird.
You look great together.
- <i>Lemme see.
- The big question is...</i>
<i>are you happy'?</i>
I'm so happy-
- I'm so happy for you, Cat!
- Sweet!
You're so different
when you're in love!
You're glowing! Look. She's glowing.
- What a glow.
- Glow. Glow in the dark.
Shut up! Okay, next topic.
Let's talk about something else.
- How are you?
- We're fine.
How are Mike and Pao?
How's Wacky?
I've never seen them for a long time.
Let's talk about... now.
You know, let's not talk about us.
What's important is now.
You and your lover boy.
Sooo, how is he in bed?
Girl, I don't know!
We're not there yet!
Ow. Wait.
Okay. Wait.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Wait.
Wh... why?
Do I have bad breath?
No.
Babe, I am so sorry.
It's just that I've never been
with somebody with,
you know, more experience.
Me? More experienced?
Why?
You mean...
You mean I'm more experienced than you?
As in you've never...?
Aww.
Pengg°Y7.
Oh my God!
No heavy lifting, okay?
Don't get it wet for three days.
- Okay, Doc.
- Yes, Doc.
- Uncle.
- You're good?
Yes. Thank you.
Well, all right.
I have to go back to the oncology ward.
Okay.
Dad.
To bring you home.
What happened?
Just a sprain.
They're just being discharged.
Oh, so your dad's a doctor.
Not just any doctor.
The best doctor ever. Right, Uncle?
I still have the mug you gave me.
Really? That was five years ago.
He was my mom's doctor.
He took care of her
like she was family.
Thank you, Uncle.
I was just doing
what Wacky asked of me.
I remember him saying "Dad,
I can't take seeing my best friend cry."
Give them a ride home.
Thank you.
Bye, Uncle.
I'll see you guys.
Let's go?
- It's okay, Joaquin.
- Yeah. It's okay.
We're good.
No, come on. I'll take you guys home.
No problem. C'mon.
Follow me.
Let's go.
- So, what happened to you?
- Thank you.
Sorry. Go ahead.
Um..
Don't tell me that kid's hurting you.
No.
No. So, what?
It was just an accident. That's it.
What kind of accident gets the arms
of two people sprained?
Don't tell me
you were having sex when...
We were not having sex!
We were not having sex.
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.
I was just asking, okay?
I don't know. I'm not a psychic.
So many possibilities
are running through my head.
Like you finally had sex.
We didn't.
And so, what happened?
What?
- What?
- Okay!
What happened?
- Annoying. Okay, fine.
- What?
I'll tell you.
We were kissing then Gillian arrived.
We were surprised. We fell. That's it.
You fell?
You fe..
As in you went rolling down?
We did not roll down!
We fell! We didn't roll!
What? Like from the bed?
Why do you have to know?
I just want to know
how you got hurt, okay?
Ouch. It hurts.
Sorry. Be careful.
How many rolls?
Meanie.
- Just kidding.
- No more questions.
Okay.
Anyway, thanks, Tarzan.
Good night.
Wait, what about tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
The laundry. The cooking.
I don't know. We'll see tomorrow.
I'm just gonna wing it.
Okay.
And for my favorite cool-timer.
What's this?
- Very good.
- Hey!
- What are you doing?
- Hi, Boss. Good morning!
- Give me tha...
- I'll do that. No. I got this.
Just relax and let me handle it.
Just sit down and eat.
- Wacky.
- Okay?
- Wha...
- Sitting down?
Sit down, Boss.
I got this. Don't worry.
Ah, there's, ah!
Alma! Coffee, please!
What about GGP?
I asked for a leave.
You're down one hand, right? So,
I'll be your right hand today. Nice!
Some sugar, please.
Wacks, you don't have to do this.
Cat, what are friends for?
Right? So go ahead and eat.
I can even feed you if you want.
Here.
It's time for you to eat.
And this is for you recovery.
I can do that. I'll do it.
- No, c'mon. Here.
- No, I'll do it.
- Wow!
- Okay, c'mon! Let's get to work!
Girls and boy!
Impressive, Sir Wacky!
- Come on. Let's...
- You stay here.
Don't move a muscle.
Oh, you. Just relax.
You need to rest your arm, right?
Just sit. I'll handle it.
You'll handle it?
- You don't know what to do.
- Relax.
You don't know how to wash clothes.
Joaquin, be careful with that.
That belongs to a tough customer.
Yes, boss.
How's this?
<i>You're gonna make a great husband.</i>
The question is
who do you want to get married to?
Hello, Babe!
Sir, looks like
you're losing her to that kid.
No gossiping. Just keep washing.
Thank you. Thank you.
More?
That's enough.
Carbs on carbs.
<i>For you, any time.</i>
Hey, wash up?
I got this.
Sit down. Relax.
Say hi to your boss for me.
You got it?
This is easy.
I can do this in my sleep.
Wacky, it's raining. Wait.
I got this. Go inside.
Wacky!
Wait! I'll get an umbrella.
Oh no. I left it at home.
Don't worry. I'm fine.
It's okay.
Wacky!
Wacky, get inside! You'll get sick.
Leave that first.
Ah!
Put it here.
Towel.
Give me your shirt.
I'll put it in the dryer.
You might get sick.
And please,
put the wet clothes in here.
Cat?
Cat?
Babe?
Babe!
Why are you here?
You should have called.
I just wanna check on you
and give you this.
Wow! Thank you!
You didn't have to...
Do you usually walk around
half-naked? Huh?
No. His shirt got wet.
He helped me carry the laundry.
His shirt's in the dryer.
Are you okay?
<i>Let's go home.</i>
Unless you still want to stay here
and wait until his shirt's dry.
- No, no. Is it okay?
- Yeah. Go ahead.
I'll close up here.
I take the car back to
your place later if you want.
No, I can drive.
No. What about your arm?
I'm fine.
All right, man. We'll go ahead.
Bye.
Babe. Babe,
don't force yourself if you can't.
We can take a taxi.
Your arm might get worse.
Babe, you sure?
Come on.
I didn't like what I saw.
It made me feel uncomfortable.
Don't do it again.
Babe, Wacky just helped me.
That's it.
I don't want you
hanging out with Wacky anymore.
It doesn't look good.
You have a boyfriend now.
I can't believe you did not do
a report on Cat and David's injury.
It's all over the internet
and we don't have a scoop.
<i>And you keep complaining
that I'm unfair.</i>
<i>That I don? Recognize your efforts?</i>
Are you listening?
Sir, yeah.
I'm sorry. Yeah. You were saying, sir?
It's bad enough that
you are incompetent.
<i>What's worse is you are irresponsible.</i>
Last Friday, you skipped the show
without telling us.
I'm sorry about that, sir.
I had something important to do.
Oh?! So the show
is not important to you?
You know what?
I don't even have
to wait for the reformat.
I can get rid of you now since
you don't seem to care anyway.
You're fired!
The doctor said...
Babe, it doesn't hurt anymore.
I'll be fine.
Okay,
I'll just put this in your bag.
If it hurts again,
just get it there, okay?
- Here, okay?
- Yeah.
<i>Okay-</i>
David, put it back.
Why is he still contacting you?
Didn't I tell you to stop
hanging out with him?
I haven't seen him in a long time.
Ever since you
picked me up at the shop.
So, what's this?
He still wants to see you.
I don't know.
What's really going on here?
What do you mean?
Are you guys just friends?
Or friends with benefits, huh?
David!
What?!
Have you seen how close they are? Huh?
I'm outta here.
David. David.
David, can we talk?
You and Gillian are very close too.
But I never thought anything of it.
Don't be like that. I'm offended.
Then tell me, Cat.
I keep trying to forget
what I saw in the shop but I can't.
There was something with
the way you looked at him,
and the way that he looked at you
that was so different.
And you never looked at me that way.
Is it him?
Is he the one
you're trying to move on from?
David...
What?! Just answer me!
David, that's over.
A longtime ago.
Let's not... please.
So it is Wacky.
No. It WAS Wacky.
- Past tense...
- I have to go.
<i>Dude, let's go.</i>
Are you okay?
Dude, I said let's go!
Hey! Stop it! David!
Sir, please take this.
Stop.
What are you doing?
- Don't drunk call. David!
- Get off me!
Hello?
I thought you were a good guy.
- You asshole!
- David!
Don't make a scene here.
Hello?
Drink.
No!
Oh!
Look at the lovely couple.
David, let's go.
My girlfriend and her best friend!
Are you just a best friend?
Or are you also her boyfriend?
David, stop it.
Huh?
- Come on.
- You wanna go?
Then go!
- Go home with your lover!
- Bro, that's enough.
- Get out of here!
- Don't call me "bro"!
You're not my friend!
'Cause if we were friends,
you wouldn't lie to me.
You lied to me.
That's not true.
Isn't he the one
you've loved for a long time?
Isn't he?!
David.
I'm so stupid to believe...
that I can make you
fall in love with me.
David, I love you.
David. David, I love you. I love you.
Don't think like that. I love you.
- David.
- David.
Come on, let's go.
Get in the back.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Don't put a blanket over him.
He'll get hot.
Here.
Thanks.
The last time David got this drunk
was two years ago.
When his parents separated.
I'm used to seeing girls
chase after David.
But you're the first one
he chased after.
That's why I know he loves you.
You're lucky.
I actually wanna be mad at you.
Because he loves you.
But I can't.
Because I know you love him too.
Because...
I see myself in you.
You're in love with your best friend...
the same way that
I'm in love with my best friend.
Gillian, I'm sorry.
No, don't be.
It's not your fault that he loves you.
And I'm just a friend.
But as someone who has been his friend
since he was eight years old,
I'm sad.
I'm hurt.
I can't take seeing him this way.
We're hurting David.
We have to stop being friends.
Cat, I love you.
Even more than a friend.
WhY Only now?
Now that I have someone?
You couldn't love me
until David came our way.
No. I've loved you for a long time.
Really?
After all the women
you've introduced to me,
after all the times
you denied kissing me,
after everything I've done for you,
just so you won't feel
like no one loves you.
Wacky, that's ten years.
I closed off my heart to everyone.
I never loved anybody else...
because I hoped the day would come
when you would love me too.
Even after everybody
kept saying it's pointless.
I waited.
Because I love you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Cat.
If I only knew.
I've loved you
from the moment I met you.
But the truth is I was afraid.
I was afraid I would hurt you.
Because I knew I was not right for you.
I was not who you needed.
Cat, I've done so many mistakes.
That I couldn't possibly be the one
for someone as perfect as you.
I'm not perfect.
And I never wanted you to be perfect.
All I wanted was for you to try.
Try to set your life straight.
Until you feel like you deserve me.
But you never tried.
You never tried for me.
And what really hurts,
is you can do it.
You can.
Like now.
Let's not make it any harder.
Let's end this.
It's over.
I thought, I thought you promised
not to break up with me...
ever?
I don't want to lose you.
All right. Thanks.
Hi, babe.
The producer of GGP called me.
He asked me if I want to
join the show after the reformat.
They want me to replace Wacky.
What did you say?
I don't think I can replace him.
Not in the show.
And most definitely, not in your heart.
David.
Hey.
Don't ever think that I don't love you.
I'm so grateful for you.
That you looked for me.
And because you found me,
I found myself.
You don't know how much
you've changed my life.
How much you make me happy.
And how sorry I am.
Sorry, David, because I hurt you.
Hey.
I know you love me.
I told you once,
the only way this wouldn't work...
is if you don't try, right?
And I see you try.
Thank you for trying so hard.
Thank you.
You could try harder to
wait for me 'til I grow up.
Or I could try harder to
wait for you to move on.
Or we could try to be honest.
I want to be honest with you.
Because you deserve it.
And because I love you.
I could ask Judith
to talk to your producer...
to get you back on the show.
It's okay, dad.
I don't want to use her name
just so I can get my job back.
I'm sure she would mind if...
I know but, Dad, I have to
take responsibilities for my actions.
It's my fault I was fired.
I know I've been a pain to all of you.
Dad, I really want to change.
And I think,
I should start with my job.
In fact, I have
a job interview with PNN.
The rival network?
Yes, dad.
That's the only way for me
to learn on my own.
I don't know what brought about
this change of heart, Wacky.
But, I'm proud of you.
And I'm sure your stepmom would be too.
Even if you do work
for another network.
Thanks, Dad.
Mon?
I know you hate celebrating but, hey.
It's your birthday only once a year.
Kevin, Claire, come on. Greet your dad.
What are you doing here?
I heard you were sick.
I'm fine.
I heard you un-followed Cat on Twitter.
You'll be okay?
Yeah.
I'll be okay.
I missed you.
I missed you too, Penggoy.
Friends forever?
Yeah.
You and me, forever.
Big sis! Wake up! Wake up!
It's your birthday! Happy birthday,
Big sis! Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday, Big sis!
- Thank you. Okay, I'm up.
- We cooked you breakfast.
- Okay.
Hey, I like your Facebook pictures.
<i>Yeah. Gillian and I
are really enjoying it here.</i>
David, just a moment.
- Cat! Happy birthday!
- Hi, Cat!
- Come inside.
- Okay.
- <i>I'm glad to hear you're enjoying there.
- Yeah. She really is the one for me.</i>
I told you, didn't I?
I'm glad you realized it.
Too bad you can't be here.
<i>Okay, see you soon.</i>
Bye!
Incredible!
Happy birthday, Big Sis!
Thank you!
Oh my God! We're so old!
Happy birthday!
- Enough singing, Pao.
- So, Cat? He's there.
Who?
The one we set you up with.
<i>Oh, you pregnant lady!</i>
<i>Tall.</i>
<i>Handsome.</i>
There you go again.
Uncle Wacky!
- Uncle Wacky, we missed you.
- Hey. Hello.
- Yeah, Uncle.
- How are you?
Wacky!
Hey, guys!
We have ice cream!
Winner!
Happy birthday, Cat.
Thank you.
I'm Wacky by the way.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
By the way, your friend told me.
Your best friend, Lyn.
That you're looking for a BF.
True! That's true.
- BF?
- Best friend.
You're so cheesy!
Can I apply for the position?
There's an opening.
What?
You know I love this song.
Game!
Ready?
I don't know what to do
whenever you are near
I don't know what to say
my heart is floating in tears.
When you pass by I could fly.
Every minute, every second of the day
I dream of you in the most special way.
- <i>You're beside</i> me <i>all the</i> time.
<i>- Finally. A happy ending.</i>
How can that be when Wacky's leaving?
Huh?
Didn't he tell you?
He's going to New York.
<i>IQQZ <i>.</i> Pa')!
<i>"50"!!-</i>
Cat.
Cat.
Boss.
Boss.
- Boss, wait. Where are you going?
- Please. Stop following me.
Where are you going?
- Why'd you walk out?
- Just please!
- Leave me alone. Please.
- Boss, why did you walk out?
- Stop. Don't...
- Huh?
Where are you going?
- Why did you walk out?
- It's raining!
Then tell me. I won't let you go...
- until you tell me why you walked out.
- We're getting wet. Don't be stupid!
Just tell me why you
walked out on me and I'll let you go.
Because I feel so stupid.
Because I missed you so much.
Me too. I missed you so much.
Okay?
Let go! Please! It's raining!
I can't get my hopes up again.
I can't be your
pseudo girlfriend again.
I agree, okay?
I can't be scared anymore.
And I can't be
just a best friend again.
That's why I want to apply
to be your boyfriend.
No.
I don't want a
long distance relationship.
Long distance?
You're going to New York, right?
Yeah. For two weeks.
Just two weeks. That's it.
I just have a special report for PNN.
I'm going to interview
OFW's in New York.
Then I'll visit my mom.
Two weeks.
Boss, please.
Boss, the reason I didn't show myself
to you these past few months...
is because I wasn't ready.
But I've changed. I've changed for you.
Because you are worth changing for
because I love you.
Boss.
Cat.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I love you.
Oh my God.
