Oh, you pesky birds!
Will you come back here?
Oh, stop!
Well, I wonder what

Well, bless my soul!
Why, it's...
It's a baby fox.

Hello, little fella.
I wonder where its mother is.
Come on, now. I'm not

Now, now. Oh, isn't that...?

Just look what you've done.
Now, don't try to butter me up.
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, Tod, I just can't

You little imp. Now
run along and play.
Go on.
And try to stay out of mischief.
Hey, it's Dinky and Boomer.
Maybe they wanna play.
Is this it, Boomer?
Sure, Dinky. This is the place.
I never forget a tree. I never

DINKY: Don't let the creep get away!
You can take him, Boomer!
Give him a left! A right!
Let him have it!
Aaah!

- This way.
There he is!
(THUD)
What happened to ya? Golly!
Oh, shucks! I think
I bent my b-b-beak.

You cost us our breakfast.
I cost us our breakfast?
It was your fault.

A worm? For breakfast?
Yuck! Blecch!
Hey, there, Copper,
what ya sniff in' at?
Somethin'... (SNIFFING)
I never smelled...
before, Chief.
Huh. Let me see.
(DEEP SNIFF)
Ah, shucks, that's easy.
The master's just cookin' grits and
fatback. You oughta know that.
Mm-mmm.
That's not what I smell.
I don't know, Chief.
- It's something else.
- (CHUCKLING)
Sonny, you got a lot of learnin' to
do about a-sniffin' and a-smellin'.
Hey, where you goin'?
I want to find out
what that smell is.
OK, Copper, but the master ain't
gonna like you wanderin' off.
I won't get lost, Chief.
I can smell my way back.
(SCOFFS)
Can't tell these young
whippersnappers anything.
(SNIFFING)
What ya smellin'?
I'm on the trail of somethin'.
Trail of what?
I don't know yet.
(SNIFFING)
Why, it's... it's you!
(HOWLING)
What do you do that for?
We're supposed to do that when
we find what we've been trackin'.
I'm a fox.
My name's Tod. What's
your name, kid?
Mine's Copper. I'm a hound dog.
Gee, I bet you'd be good
playin' hide-and-seek.
Wanna try it, Copper?
Can I use my nose?
Sure. OK.
Now go ahead and close
your eyes and count.
One, two, three...
No, Copper! You can't peek!
- Oh.
- Now start again.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...
My, my. Look at that.
A fox and a hound,
playin' together.
<i>When you're the best of friends</i>
<i>Having so much fun together</i>
<i>You're not even aware
you're such a funny pair</i>
<i>You're the best of friends</i>

<i>Neither one of you sees
your natural boundaries</i>
<i>Life's one happy game</i>

- MAN: Copper! (WHISTLES)
Gee, I've gotta go.
<i>If only the world
wouldn't get in the way</i>
<i>If only people would

(ROOSTER CROWING)

<i>Oh, I hope</i>

Come on, Copper!
<i>'Cause you're the best of friends</i>
Copper, you're my very best friend.
And you're mine too, Tod.
And we'll always be friends
forever, won't we?
Yeah, forever.
Hey, let's go swimmin'!
Give me a head start
and I can beat ya!
- (LAUGHING)
- (WATER SPLASHING)
Whoo!
Dagnabit! That Copper pup's
gone and strayed off again.
Come on, Chief.
If that little rascal's gonna
make me a good huntin' dog,
he's gotta learn to mind.
(MAN WHISTLING)
Copper! Get over here! (WHISTLES)
- (TOD SPLASHING, CHUCKLING)
- Copper!
Uh-oh. I gotta go home.
Do ya have to? We're

I gotta. He sounds awful mad.
I'll see ya tomorrow!
- And don't forget!
- I won't!
(SIGHING)
(RUSTLING)
Hey, Copper, what happened to ya?
Why didn't you...?
Golly! You're all tied up.
Yeah, and it's no fun either.
The master says I gotta stay home.
Well, we can play around here then.
(LAUGHING)
Oh, no. Not with old
Chief over there.
(SNORING)
Is that him making
that awful noise?
He keeps me awake at night.
Oh, don't go in there!
He can get awful mean!
He's cranky.
Gee-whillikers, is he ever big.
His ears isn't as big
as yours, Copper.
That's not the part you
gotta worry about.
Wow! Look at those teeth.
That's the part you
gotta worry about!
I'm gainin' on him.
- He won't get away now.
- He's wakin' up!
Get out, Tod!
No. He's havin' a dream.
He's chasin' somethin'.
CHIEF: When I get him cornered...
(CHUCKLING)
It's... It's... It's
a big old badger.
Copper, he's chasin' a badger.
No, no, it ain't a badger.
It's a... It's a f...
It's a fox. A fox?

- Hold it right there!
Watch it! That thing's loaded!
Now it ain't loaded!
Dagnabit, woman! Your thievin'
fox was after my chickens!
Rubbish and poppycock!
I don't believe it. He
wouldn't hurt a thing.
You callin' me a liar,
you muddleheaded female?
- I saw it happen!
- Amos Slade, that temper of yours
is going to get you
into a lot of trouble.
Temper?
Temper, woman? You
ain't seen my temper!
If I ever catch that fox on my
property again, I'll blast him!
And next time, I won't miss!
Poor little tyke.
It's a shame I have to
keep him cooped up.
(CHUCKLES)
Tod, stop looking at me like that.
It's not my fault, you know.
You caused a lot of
trouble yesterday.
(CHIEF BARKING)
Oh, now what are they up to?
(SCOFFS) Why, it looks like Amos
is going on a hunting trip.
A long one, from the looks of it.
Hmm. Well, good riddance!

Dad blame it. Get goin'!
There. Well, that's more like it.

Well, Copper, me and old Chief are
gonna teach you all about huntin'.
Yes, sir. It's about time too.
Attaboy. (CHUCKLING)
Yeah, you're gonna like trackin'
down those varmints for me.
(BARKING)
Uh-uh. Get in the back, half-pint.

Well, boys, we're gettin'

(ENGINE RATTLING, BACKFIRES)
(ENGINE BACKFIRING)
(HOWLING)
Tod, honey, what are
you doin' over here?
Gee, I just wanted to
say goodbye to Copper,
but I'm too late.
Well, what did you plan to
do if you ran into old Chief?
Ah, Chief. I can outfox
that dumb old dog anytime.
Tod, now hold it just one minute.
Didn't you learn
anything yesterday?
Now you listen good, Tod,
because it's either
education or elimination.
Now if you're so foxy and
old Chief's so dumb,
then why does that hound
get the fox on the run?
'Cause he's got the hunter, and
the hunter's got the gun. Ka-bam!
Elimination. Lack of education.
<i>If you pal around with
that Copper hound</i>
<i>You'll wind up hangin' on the wall</i>
<i>Keep your nose to the wind
You'll keep your skin</i>
<i>'Cause you won't be home when
the hunter comes to call...</i>
Oh, Big Mama, I know Copper
would never track me down.
Why, old Copper,
he's my best friend.
(CHUCKLES) Your best friend.
Now, Copper's gonna do
what he's been told.
Supposed to chase the little
old fox into the old foxhole,
then along comes the hunter
with a buckshot load.
- Ka-ka-ka-bam!
- BIG MAMA: Elimination.
Lack of education.
You better believe it, Tod.
Yes, sirree!
You mean Copper is
gonna be my enemy?
DINKY: Hey!
Kid, you better step over
here and take a good look.
(CREAKING)
Why... Why, that's awful.
Those poor things.
I'm sorry, Tod.
Honey, Copper's gonna come
back a trained huntin' dog.
A real killer.
Oh, no, not my friend Copper.
He won't ever change.
I hope you're right, Tod.
And we'll keep on being
friends forever.
Um, won't we, Big Mama?
Darlin', forever is
a long, long time,

of changin' things.

We'll get that no-good

We're back. We flew all the way.
Yeah, we did. We did.
Welcome home, boys!
It's been kind of lonesome around
here without you little rascals.
Hi, fellas!
Hey, who's that? Who's that?
This can't be that
scrawny little squirt
we found by the fence
post, can it? Come on.
I... I can't believe my eyes.
(LAUGHS) Oh, it's me, all right.
Hey, looky there. He's got

Hey, hey, hey. Just look at

Aw, come on. Cut it out. You

Hey, it's him, it's him. Squeeks.

Aw, come on, Chief.
Just 'cause you're not sittin' up front,
that ain't no reason to be a sorehead.
Shucks, if it weren't for you,
Copper'd never have turned
into a good huntin' dog.
Yes, sirree.
Now I got me the best
two dogs there is.
Right, Copper?
(HOWLING)
Isn't he somethin', Chief?
(BOTH HOWLING)
(HOWLING IN DISTANCE)
Look, Big Mama! Copper's back!
Boy, has he grown big.
Uh-huh. (CHUCKLES)
And look at that big pile of
skins he helped track down.
I know, Big Mama. He's
a huntin' dog now.
You're right. And you're a fox.
Ah, that won't make any difference.
Copper's gonna be glad to see me.
Well, honey, just don't
get your hopes too high.
Look, don't worry. I'll be careful.
I'll go tonight when Chief
and the hunter are asleep.
Boy, it's great to be back
home, isn't it, Chief?
(SCOFFS)
Aw, come on, Chief. You
aren't still sore, are ya?
Hey, hey, come on. Let's scuffle.
We ain't scuffled in a long time.
Come on, Chief!
Let's have some fun!
Oh, lay off, Copper, you

(GROWLING)
Oh, let go!
Dagnabit! Let go, I say!
Oh, OK, OK.
That was your trouble on the hunt.
Aw, come on, old-timer.
You treat me like a

Why, I think I done real good

Mr. Digger, sir? It was

You keep out of this,

Why don't you go back
where you came from?
Wham?
Well, go on.
Get goin'. Git!
Aww.
Gosh, he seems so... I don't
know, so downhearted, Big Mama.
Well, you can't blame him, honey.
He was dropped out here and left all
alone without a friend in the world.
Well, maybe there's
something I could do.
You know, cheer him up.
Honey, you just said
the magic words.
Now... (WHISPERING, INDISTINCT)
What? (CHUCKLING)
But Big Mama, I don't...
Darlin', don't move.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.

Hello, Big Mama.
Last night was pretty miserable
for you, wasn't it, honey?
Just terrible.
Cheer up and look around.
The forest is beautiful
this morning.
After last night, nothin'
looks beautiful.
Wow!
Who...? Who is that?
Oh, just another fox.
A lady fox.
Golly!
Is she beautiful!
I wonder what her name is.
Well, why don't you go ask her?
Yeah. Yeah, guess... Guess I will.
I'll... I'll go up to her and I'll
say, "You're the most gorgeous...
The most beautiful... (STAMMERING)
Never seen anyone,
anywhere..." I'll say...
Hi.
Hello.
- Big Mama told me, you know...
- I just happened to be...
May I call you by your first name?
VIXEY: Oh. Sure. Why not?
Thanks, but what...?
What is your first name?
- Vixey.
- Vixey.
Uh-huh.
My name is... is... uh, Tod.
Tod?
That's a... That's
a nice name, Tod.
It looks like that farm boy is
makin' it b-b-big with her.
- (GASPS)
- Shh! Now just keep it down.
Well, Tod, you know something?
This stream is just full of trout.
Do you think you could catch one?
- One what?
- One what? Fish, silly!
Oh, oh, yeah! Oh, yeah.
My dear young lady...
you happen to be looking
at an expert... fisher fox.
Oh, Tod, Tod. Don't overdo it.
I know all the tricks.
In fact, I... I never miss.
Please let him catch a fish.
(GASPS) Here comes a whopper!
Now, watch closely.
Tod, do you need help?
No. No, I... I do it this way
all... all the... all the time!
I got him.
(LAUGHING) Oh, that farm boy, he
don't know nothin' about f-f-fishin'.
He ain't gonna hook her that way.
(LAUGHING) Oh, gosh!
Tod, you're the funniest
thing I ever saw!
Go ahead! Go ahead and laugh!
You're like everyone
else around here.
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You are so funny.
So I can't fish!
You're a silly,
empty-headed... female!
Now just a minute.
I mean, you've got a nerve.
Why don't you grow up?
Tod, that's no way
to talk to Vixey.
Oh, raspberries! I've had it.
Honey, don't stay mad.
You gotta be natural. That's
the trick. Can't you see?
<i>When you have a natural attraction</i>
<i>You deserve a mutual reaction</i>
<i>You're gonna get a whole lot</i>
<i>Of satisfaction</i>
<i>Here's all you gotta do</i>
<i>When you feel that</i>
<i>Natural affection</i>
<i>Leads you in the positive direction</i>
<i>You gotta stop showin' off</i>
<i>Start showin' up</i>
<i>With little old natural you</i>
- (SNEEZING)
<i>- Yes, you gotta appreciate the lady</i>
<i>And now that is a natural fact</i>
<i>'Cause when you be yourself</i>
<i>With the lady, yeah</i>
<i>You gonna get appreciated</i>
<i>Right back</i>
(CHUCKLING)
Shh.
- But Big Mama...
- It's just getting interesting.
Tod, I...
I just know you're
gonna love the forest.
Listen, come on. Let
me show you around.
Sure.
Come on.
(CHUCKLING)
Look. One, two, three,
four, five, six.
Seven.
I think six would be just right.
Six?
- Six what?
- (CHUCKLING)
"No hunting."
Well, now, we ain't gonna do
none of that, are we, Copper?
We're just gonna get
us a no-good fox.
All right, boy, get trackin'.
Smell him out.
(SNIFFING)
(SNIFFING, GROWLING)
What ya got there, Copper?
(RATTLING)
Good work, boy.
He'll be comin' right through
here, headin' for water.
But he won't be drinkin' any.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
What a beautiful morning, Vixey.
You know, I've never been happier.
Oh, Tod, me too.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
- That does it.
- (TRAP SQUEAKING)
Amos, you crafty old coot.
The devil himself couldn't
have done no better.
Tod?
- Tod, wait a minute.
- What is it, Vixey?
I don't wanna go in
there. It's too quiet.
Oh, Vixey.
(RUSTLING)
(SNIFFING)
What?
Tod, be careful.
(CLICKING)
(SNAPPING)
Dad blast it! He's gettin' away!
- (COPPER BARKING)
- Quick, Vixey!
Go on, head for the burrow.
(GROWLING)
(WHIMPERING)
(SNARLING)
Quick, Vixey. Out the back.
Tod!
(COPPER GROWLING)
Oh, no, Tod.
(WHIMPERING)
(SNARLING)
(CHUCKLING)
Cooper! Copper!
We got 'em now for sure.
This is their only way out.
- Steady, boy. Steady. Get ready.
- (GROWLING)
Tod! (COUGHING)
We're trapped!
Tod, I'm scared.
Quick, Vixey! This
is our only chance!
Whoa! No! I don't believe it!
(COPPER BARKING)
Copper, we've trapped him now!
(ROARING)
(SNARLING)
(GASPING)
- (GASPING) Ow!
- (SNAPPING)
- (ROARING)
- (GROWLING)
Copper!
- (GROWLING)
- (SNARLING)
(GASPS)
(WHIMPERING)
Tod!
(GROWLING)
(COPPER WHIMPERING)
(ROARING)
(GROWLING)
(WHIMPERING)
(PANTING)
Tod?
(SHOTGUN COCKING)
(PANTING)
Come on, Copper. Get outta the way.
(WHIMPERING)
Well...
come on, boy.
Let's go home.
(TAPPING)
(CHUCKLING)
Shh, Shh. This is it.
We got him for sure now.
Oh, my g-g-gosh!
- Whoa!
- Yoww!
What happened?
Hey, there's somethin'
very familiar about
those eyes, Dinky.
Nah, it couldn't be.
Could it?
(CHUCKLING)
Bye, Squeeks. Bye.
Good luck, honey.
SLADE:
Ouch! You're killin' me! Ouch!
Amos Slade, will you hold still?
You're behaving like a child.
Well, for gosh sakes, you're
hurtin' my foot, woman!
- Nonsense! Your foot is mendin' fine.
- Ow! (MOANING)
You'll soon be yourself.
Oh, land sakes. I don't
know if I like that.
- Ow! Be careful! Ouch!
- (SCOFFS)
He's sure makin' a big fuss
over a little old hurt leg.
<i>YOUNG TOD: Copper?</i>
<i>You're my very best friend.</i>
YOUNG COPPER:
<i>And you're mine too, Tod.</i>
<i>YOUNG TOD: And we'll always
be friends forever, won't we?</i>
<i>YOUNG COPPER: Yeah, forever.</i>
