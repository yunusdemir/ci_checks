<i>This is the story of how
the destiny of a nation.</i>
<i>Was changed by a birthmark,
a royal birthmark,</i>
<i>on the royal posterior
of a royal infant child.</i>
<i>Here returning to his
castle is King Roderick,</i>
<i>Roderick the tyrant,</i>
<i>who some months before seized the throne
by a massacre of the entire royal family.</i>
<i>But uneasy lies Roderick's crown,
for rumor hath it that an infant,</i>
<i>the rightful heir to the throne,
had survived the massacre</i>
<i>and even now was being cared for
by a group in the forest,</i>
<i>a group led by an elusive, dashing outlaw</i>
<i>known only as,</i>
<i>The Black Fox!</i>
"The child lives. Death to the tyrant!"
"The Black Fox!"
The Black Fox again!
To the castle, quick!
My kingdom seething with revolt,
cutthroats and assassins in every tree!
Why must I be surrounded by fools?
Ravenhurst!
- Ravenhurst!
- Sire.
Could you have been so incompetent,
bungled so horribly as to have
permitted that child to live?
Sire, there is no child.
My men assure me that none of
the royal family escaped alive.
Believe me, Sire, this is nonsense.
Nonsense? You call it nonsense, Ravenhurst?
Is it nonsense that I cannot ride in my own
domain without being murderously attacked?
My child, I came within an inch of my life.
Oh, father.
Each day some new insurrection.
Who is this Black Fox?
Just some ridiculous adventurer
with a handful of rabble.
Rabble today, but an army tomorrow.
We need help to wipe
them out, men and arms.
Aye, an alliance with our good friend.
Griswold of the North.
Aye, alliance. And quickly.
He arrives tomorrow for
the great tournament.
Alliance with Griswold?
Sire, this rabble can be crushed.
Griswold has men and arms.
We need no uncouth
interloper from the north.
Uncouth, yes. But Griswold<i> is</i> strong.
Perhaps too strong. Perhaps
our friend Ravenhurst
fears an alliance would put Griswold and
not himself at the King's right hand!
You shall die for this!
One of us will!
Stop! Stop, I say!
Put up your sword, you fool!
- Sire!
- Silence.
- But, Sire!
- Silence!
- Come, Sire.
- And you, too!
Must we quarrel amongst ourselves?
Do you think I could make alliance?
Griswold is rich. What
could I offer him?
That which he desires most in the world.
Marriage, Sire. With your
daughter, the fair Gwendolyn.
Marriage with Griswold? Never!
What's that you say?
He's a brute and a lout.
Brute or not, lout or not, if I so
decide, you will marry Griswold.
I will not.
I am the King. If it pleases
me, you will marry Griswold.
If it pleases you so much,
you marry Griswold.
When I marry, I marry for love,
someone dashing and romantic who will carry
me off as a princess should be carried off.
Who fills your head with
this childish fiddle-faddle?
Ah, I know. Griselda.
She of the evil eye. Take
the witch out and burn her.
Harm one hair of her head, and I throw
myself from the highest turret.
Gwendolyn, you go too far.
Dire news, Sire.
I've just come from the forest.
The child lives!
- The child lives?
- Aye, Sire.
How know you this is the royal child
and not some outrageous impostor?
Because, Sire, disguised as a
member of their group, I saw him,
and I can assure you that,
like his royal ancestors,
and on the same spot as
his royal ancestors,
he bears the royal birthmark.
The,
Purple Pimpernel?
The Purple Pimpernel.
Ohh.
Then why stand you here, you
incompetent jackanapes?
To horse! To the forest!
Cut them down!
Kill the infamous child who
claims to be the rightful King!
And destroy forever this traitorous
fiend who calls himself The Black Fox!

Hawkins! Hawkins! Come here!
Did you hurt yourself?
Hawkins, are you all right?
Hope you're all right, Hawkins.
Come here!
Sir.
Hawkins, how many times have I told
you to stay out of my clothes?
And who are these little people?
These are my friends, Sir. They
worked with me at the carnival.
They're the finest troupe of acrobats
and tumblers in all of England.
But why did you bring them here?
Well, they, too, would be
part of our group, Sir.
They feel strongly as
we do about the tyranny
and would join in our worthy cause.
Sir.
Well, Captain?
The new recruits are arming, Sir.
Good. Hawkins,
I don't mean to be disparaging
to your little friends,
but weapons are limited, and,
oh, I didn't intend for them to fight, Sir.
I merely thought that they would take
over my chores of entertaining the men.
Then perhaps I'd be free
to bear arms myself, Sir,
and come to grips with the enemy,
face to face, and steel to
steel, fist to fist, Sir.
Hmm.
Little friends, I'm sorry, but food and
weapons are limited, so you see,
we'll do anything for Hawkins, Sir.
He always was our friend.
I'm sorry. There's no time to discuss it.
Please go, quickly and without detection.
Well, if you ever need us, call us.
Thank you. I shall.
Hawkins, the recruits
will be here in a moment.
Get the child.
The child.
Uh, I hate to keep mentioning this, Sir,
just get the child.
Well, Sir, you know I'd do
anything for his Majesty,
but don't you think it would
look better if a woman,
tend to your duty! And
get out of my clothes!
Yes, Sir.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Sir, don't you think it
really would look better
if this kind of thing were done by a woman?
I've told you repeatedly, Hawkins,
each one serves as best he can.
I know, Sir, but when I ran away from the
carnival, Sir, and joined your group,
I thought I'd be in the thick of it,
robbing the rich and giving to the poor,
Sir.
Our presence is known. The
King's men are on their way.
We must disperse.
Maid Jean. You will see that the child
is transported to the abbey in Dover.
The usual method?
The usual method.
Come, Hawkins.
Yes, Captain.
The rest of you men, disperse!
Hawkins, hurry.
I'm putting the last touches on right now.
Don't just stand there, man. Make haste!
There.
Why do you stare?
I,
Beg pardon, Captain,
but I'm, I'm sorry, Captain.
I didn't mean to stare.
Each time I see you as a
woman, Sir, I, I,
I mean, with your flowing hair,
conceal the child.
- Quickly.
- Yes, Captain.
The King's men.
You know what to do, Hawkins.
Yes, Captain, I'll try.
Hold there! Hold, I say!
Come down, old man. We would talk to you.
You, too, wench.
What's that?
Hurry along. This is King's business.
Hey, what's the meaning of this?
Come on!
Ohh, what's the meaning of this?
What do you want of us?
Where go you, ancient one?
Who are you?
What's that?
<i>Who</i> are you?
What's that?
Who are you?!
Fine, thank you.
No, no, no. <i>Who.</i>
<i>Who.</i> Who?
Who?
I'm Foutzingdale, the wine merchant.
And this is my little granddaughter.
Poor child, she's a mute.
She neither speaks nor hears
except through my fingers.
Child, no, no. Here.
Child!
These, these are the King's men.
Men of the King!
She says, "long live the
King and down with his,"
long live the King
and down with,
long,
a little harder, dear.
Long live the King and down with his,
not quite so hard.
Long live the King and
down with his enemies!
Enough!
Have you seen a group in
the forest with a child?
- What's that?
- A child!
A child. Child! Oh,
a lovely child.
Pretty little creature, isn't it?
But you stay away from her!
No, no. A child. So big.
With a little mark on,
you do, and I'll break
every bone in your body!
Ask the, ask the girl if she's
seen a group in the forest.
What's that? What?
Ask the girl if she's seen
a group in the forest.
What do you, what?
Ask the girl if she's seen
a group in the forest!
There's no need to holler, Sir,
for I hear very well indeed.
Well, ask her!
Ask her what?
If she's seen a group in the forest!
Eh, eh, child,
have you seen a group in the forest?
Eh, she says, "no."
What took her so long?
Stutters.
Oh, we waste time with these dolts!
On your way. Off with you.
Oh, he's quite all right.
You were excellent, Hawkins.
You, too, Captain.
We played our parts
extremely well, I thought.
You know, we should spend a lot more time
together. Uh, for rehearsal, I mean.
There's a storm brewing. We'll spend
the night in the woodman's hut.
Yes, Captain.

His Majesty's asleep now.
We better get some sleep, too.
Over there.
There's only room for one. I-I
think you'd better take it.
We can both lie there.
If you get wet and ill, you'll
be no use to his Majesty at all.
Lie down.
Yes, Captain.
Wet.
Very.
There'd be more room if
you raised your arm.
The other one.
Sorry.
Hawkins
yes, Captain?
I'm sorry I, I spoke in the manner I did.
I was wrong.
Y-yes, Captain.
There's something else I'd like to say.
Yes?
I<i> am</i> a woman,
and I do have feelings.
I,
I, I find it hard to believe that,
the Captain could ever
be fond of a man who,
isn't a fighter.
Sometimes tenderness and
kindness can also make a man.
A very rare man.
Could the Captain ever,
could the Captain ever
entertain thoughts of,
marriage with such a man?
Yes, Hawkins.
I think she could.
And would.
If things were different.
How dif-different?
The infant on the throne and,
our fight for freedom won.
Why does such a little girl
have to do such a big job?
It's the way I was brought up.
My father's influence.
You see, my father made
me everything I am.
He does beautiful work.
He taught me how to,
love freedom and,
hate injustice,
the use of, of weapons and,
how to fight.
In fact, I think he,
he really wanted me to,
be a boy.
Too bad. You'd have made a wonderful girl.
No. We daren't think of ourselves
until our fight is won.
Yes, but that could take 20 years or more.
Or 20 hours. If only we could
put our plan into operation.
Plan? Do we have a p-plan?
A handful of men could overthrow
the castle in a matter of hours.
You see, there's a secret passage
that starts in the forest and tunnels
underneath the walls of the castle.
A secret passage.
But it's locked at both ends, and the
key is in the King's possession.
In the King's possession, mmm.
If only we could have someone
inside the castle,
an intimate of the King,
with access to his chambers.
Mm-hmm. With access to his chambers.
Uh, but that's impossible.
Whoa, now!
Ahh! Good evening! A thousand
apologies for this intrusion,
but may I beg shelter and warmth
from this miserable storm?
Who are you?
A stranger in this land, young
woman, but not for long.
I'm Giacomo of the continent,
the King's new Jester.
The court Jester.
Giacomo?
Giacomo the incomparable!
King of Jesters and Jester of kings!
Well, where are you from?
Most recently, the Italian court,
but I've entertained in
all the courts of Europe
and speak a ready wit
in their every tongue.
Hawkins, we are indeed honored
that our humble hut should shelter one who
tomorrow will be an intimate of the King,
with access to his chambers.
But how will they know you?
Are you sure that no one at the
castle has ever seen your face?
Not yet, but I assure you,
ere another sun has set,
the entire court of England will
succumb to the charm, wit, and song
of the incomparable
Giacomo, King of Jesters,
and Jester to the King.
I'll take the child to the abbey.
You must go to the castle at once.
Quickly, into his clothes.
Well, what are we going to do about him?
I'll notify the fox.
He'll be taken care of.
Now listen. Listen carefully.
Once inside the castle,
you must get to the King's chamber and
find the key to the secret passage.
Key to the passage. Right.
Then you must give it
to the one man inside the
castle who's our confederate.
Confederate. You mean we
already have somebody
inside the castle, one of our own people?
You will contact him by
whistling our secret call.
Whistle it, hum it, sing it.
But I don't understand.
If we already have somebody inside the
castle, why doesn't he get the key?
You'll understand when you see him.
Now, he'll hear that and identify himself.
Why can't you just tell me his name?
Should they discover you, they might
force you to reveal his identity.
I'd like to ask you one question,
after months of pleading for
just this kind of action,
what makes you think that anybody,
anybody
could force me to reveal the
identity of my confederate?
Because they'd put you on the rack, crack
your every bone, scald you with hot oil,
and remove the nails off your
fingers with flaming-hot pincers.
I'd like to withdraw the question.
Hawkins, the future of
England depends on this.
You cannot fail.
I will not.
Oh, heaven help you.
Now, remember, from this moment on,
you're no longer Hubert Hawkins,
the carnival entertainer.
You're the incomparable Giacomo,
King of Jesters and
Jester to the King.
Jester to the King.
Jester to the King. To the King?
The child escapes.
You hear that, Ravenhurst?
The child escapes.
Gwendolyn, dear, do stop picking
that thing. The revolt spreads.
Brockhurst here says
alliance with Griswold.
Finsdale says alliance.
Pertwee says alliance.
And yet, you, Ravenhurst,
you of all my minis,
Sire, if Milords Brockhurst,
Finsdale, and Pertwee
plead so strongly for alliance, then, by
all means, let us have such alliance,
a marriage between Sir Griswold
and the Princess Gwendolyn.
You're quite right.
Never. Never marriage with Griswold.
Be sensible.
Sensible? I've seen this monster,
and it's not for nothing
he's called "The Grim and
Grisly Gruesome Griswold."
Grim, grisly, or gruesome,
you marry Griswold.
I'll die first.
Go to your chambers.
Good. It is done. Arrange for the
wedding directly after the tournament.
We'll make a show of this.
You there, go hence.
Scour the countryside, bring in
the fairest wenches in the land.
Mind you, see that they are the fairest.
Wenches, laughter, song,
that's what this court needs.
Indeed, Sire, and the good
Giacomo will provide it.
Giacomo? Who's Giacomo?
He's the new Jester I've sent for,
by reputation, the gayest and
wittiest entertainer in Europe.
Splendid. What a festival this will be,
jousting by our boldest knights,
wenches at our beck and call,
my daughter married to Griswold, who
will take her to a castle up north,
way up north.
My gentle lords, you make me very happy.
They have won.
For the moment, yes,
but the King is guided by the last voice
he hears, and that voice shall be mine.
Giacomo will see to that.
Giacomo? A mere Jester?
With one special talent, for which
my agent has bargained dearly.
In addition to his brilliance
as an entertainer,
the Jester Giacomo also happens to be
the world's most skillful,
devious, and subtle master
of the art of assassination.

Well, Sire, you know the Italian court.

Italian court. Court Italians.

Oh, Ravenhurst, the fellow has wit.

Oh, it's very simple, Sire.
When the Doge did his
duty and the Duke didn't,
that's when the duchess did the
dirt to the Duke with the Doge.
Who did what to what?
Oh, they all did, Sire. There
they were in the dark,
the Duke with his dagger, the Doge with
his dart, and the duchess with her dirk.
Duchess with her dirk?
Yes. The duchess dug at the Duke
just when the Duke dove at the Doge.
Now, the Duke ducked, the Doge dodged,
and the duchess didn't, so
the Duke got the duchess,
the duchess got the Doge,
and the Doge got the Duke.
Curious. I, I, I, I,
all I heard was that the duchess
had a siege of rheumatism.
She's 83, you know.
Oh, come next summer, Sire.
So is the Duke?
So is the Duke. Remarkable, those Italians.
Made the whole thing up, didn't you?
Very witty, very clever. Just
what this court needs,
laughter, gaiety, song, wenches.
Oh, yes, wenches.
I'm just on my way to
inspect the lot of them.
Who knows? I may find some luscious,
Sire, if I may suggest, it ill befits
the propriety of your high office
to be seen with these unkempt wenches.
What?
It is said the incomparable Giacomo
has a discerning eye for beauty.
Why not let him select a suitable
companion for Your Majesty?
Excellent, excellent.
I trust the Jester's reputation is based
upon many years of, accomplishment?
Why do you think they call me
incomparable, Sire? Get it?
- Got it.
- Good.
Bring her to my chambers. Within the hour?
Within the hour.
Finish with the King and
come to my chambers.
Within the hour.
About that song, Sir,
some other time, my good man.
Fergus, get on with your work.
The good Captain will escort
you to your quarters.
Very well.
Are you sure we haven't met before?
Quite sure.
Within the hour.
Your Giacomo seems more the
fool than the assassin
or perchance a brilliant
combination of both.
We shall see.
♪ La da da Dee Dee dum ♪
♪ I'm Giacomo ♪
♪ Giacomo ♪
♪ My fame before me rings ♪
♪ King of Jesters ♪
♪ And Jester of kings, ♪
What are you doing here?
I'm Fergus, the hostler.
Who-Gus the what-sler?
Fergus, the hostler.
It is I, not Ravenhurst,
who is your friend.
Look, my good man, you pick your
friends, and I shall pick mine.
At the moment, I have a very
important mission with the King.
After all, I'm the incomparable Giacomo,
King of Jesters and Jester of kings.
I have entertained in all
the courts of Europe
and speak a ready wit
in their every tongue.
Who are you?
- I am Griselda.
- Gri-who-Ida?
Griselda. I bring you a
message from the princess.
The royal princess?
She finds you most attractive
and would like to meet you.
M-me?
Yes. She finds you passing
fair, passing graceful.
W-w-well, tell her thank you very
much, but I'm just passing through.
One does not ordinarily refuse a princess.
Well, one doesn't
ordinarily, but, you see,
is it possible there's someone
else of whom you are fond?
Y-yes, as a matter of fact, there is.
Giacomo, would you look in my eye?
Eye?
Yes. It's been troubling me, and
I thought that the great Giacomo
would have a knowledge of science.
Science. Well, yes, as a matter of fact,
I have a great deal of
scientific knowledge.
We have, which eye?
Both.
Look at them both.
Closer, closer.
Deeper, deeper.
Deeper, deeper.
Tails of lizards, ears of swine,
chicken gizzards soaked in brine,
now thine eyes and mine entwine,
thy will is broken,
thou art mine.
Repeat after me, I am craven,
and thou art my master.
I am craven, and thou art my master.
- Stand there, fool.
- Stand there, fool.
- Silence!
- Silence!
You are in my power
- and will obey my every command.
- Every command.
And, remember, any time I choose,
a mere snap of the fingers
can bring you out of the spell like this.
And back like that.
Do you understand, fool?
Yes, master. You can snap
me in and snap me out.
Now listen closely.
First and foremost, you must convince
the girl that this is a miracle,
that you've been sent here by the gods.
To do that, you must go to
her room and make love.
Go and make love to the princess.
- The princess.
- At once!
Wait. Not like that.
You are a figure of romance,
of spirit and action,
but at the same time, humble and tender.
You are a man of iron
with the soul of a poet.
You are adventurous, gay,
but with a lover's brooding melancholy,
and above all, you must show passion.
- Hmm?
- Show passion!
Not me, you fool! Now go.
Make love.
Climb the vine to the tower where
your love awaits you, stop!
<i>But,</i> above all, remember, you
must be cavalier, dashing.
Fear not, master. Once I'm up the thorny
vine, the regal maiden shall be mine.
Ooh!
Fear not, master.
Hawkins.
You got here.
Of course I got here,
my silly little goose.
Thank heaven.
Ah-ta-ta. You'll have to wait
your turn like the others.
Good. You're doing it well.
Have you heard the change of plan?
Here. Take this.
I just told you, dear, you'll
just have to wait your turn.
Now, don't overdo it. Fergus
will bring you the infant.
Well, well, Giacomo.
Successful so soon.
Truly as dainty a dish as
ever was set before a King.
About your business. I would
have a word with the maiden.
Your Majesty. Oop!
What is your name, child?
Jean, Sire.
Jean,
a lovely name,
for a lovely face.
See that she's jeweled and gowned.
She shall sit next to me
at the banquet tonight.
You! You've come.
At your service, Milady.
So this is Giacomo,
King of Jesters and Jester of kings.
Not today, Milady.
Today I am Giacomo, a
lover of beauty. Mmm.
And a beauty of a lover.
Can this be true, or is it merely a dream?
Dream? Is this a dream?
Or this? Or this? Or this?
Or this?
Oh, no, no, no, no. We are
strangers, hardly met.
What manner of man are you, Giacomo?
What manner of man is Giacomo? Ha ha!
I shall tell you what manner of man is he.
He lives for a sigh.
He dies for a kiss.
He lusts for a laugh. Ha!
He never walks when he can leap.
He never flees when he can fight.
Ooh.
He swoons at the beauty of a
rose, and I offer myself to you,
all of me, my heart, my
lips, my legs, my calves.
Do what you will. My love endures.
Beat me. Kick me.
I am yours.
Oh, Giacomo, you are so ardent.
With your permission, Milady,
I'd like to go 'round again.
Oh, no, Giacomo. We
must be discreet.
Fah! Discretion is for
fools and simpletons.
This cannot be.
Miracles are things of fancy, and
lovers are not sent by the gods.
Speak not too lightly, my love.
Who are we to say nay to miracles?
But one doesn't find love
in one moment, one kiss.
That key, where did you find it?
It is a miracle.
The gods who sent you have also
provided a means to our escape.
This is the key to the secret passageway.
Grand. We leave at midnight. Get it?
- Got it.
- Good.
Very good.
Oh, no, no, my precious.
I'll keep it next to my heart,
a sweet symbol of your love.
And take this, a sweet symbol of mine.
I'll wear it always next to my heart.
Gwendolyn, are you there? I
would have words with you.
- My father. You must hide.
- Hide?
Giacomo hides for no man.
But you must. He'd kill any
man found in my chambers.
Ah, be him King or peasant, my
ready blade shall find its mark.
I'll, I'll, I live for a sigh.
I die for a kiss. I lust for a laugh.
Ha ha!
Quickly, or our lives aren't worth that.
- What? Uh, uh,
- Don't be frightened.
Are you alone, my dear? I
thought I heard voices.
Yes, I'm quite alone, father.
- Listen, my child,
- The King.
I've just met Griswold's emissary,
and the marriage is approved.
You know very well, father, that
when I marry, I marry only for love.
I knew you'd say that. Now,
Gwendolyn, do be reasonable.
Don't you realize that
without this alliance,
our prestige, our power, our
position could go like that?
Well, then, let it go like that.
I wish you to marry Griswold.
And suppose I do not
wish to marry Griswold?
I don't give a fig for your wishes.
And I don't give a fig for yours.
No one snaps at the King.
Don't you dare snap at me.
I'll snap if I choose.
Don't snap at me.
- I will snap.
- You<i> won't.</i>
Understand this, my child,
this castle has walls high and strong,
with massive gates under lock and key.
Whilst you remain within those walls and I
am the King, you will obey my commands.
Very well, father. Perhaps I have
been selfish and thoughtless.
Oh, my child.
I knew I could depend upon you,
because you are a princess,
a true princess, loyal to the crown,
sympathetic, sensitive, faithful,
- the key to the secret passage.
- Father, let me have it.
So you'd run away?
You trick me not.
This key will never leave my person.
You will marry Griswold upon the morrow,
and I promise you, daughter
or not, princess or not,
one move, one false move, and
your neck will snap like a twig.
Where is he? Giacomo
hides not behind drapes.
No, no, no. You must go.
I'll cut him to ribbons.
No, we'll escape tonight after the banquet.
Very well, my sweet. Until
tonight, very good.
Do be cautious, sweet Giacomo.
Fah! Caution is for
popinjays and cockatoos.
Begging your pardon.
Until tonight, my sweet.
But you heard what my father said.
If caught, our necks will snap like twigs.
- Like what?
- Twigs.
Twigs? Speak not of twigs
when you look at an oak.
Until tonight, my little sapling.
If Giacomo says he'll be here
within the hour, he will be here,
within the hour.
At your service, Milord.
Your arrival, Giacomo, shows
imagination and brilliance.
Did you expect less?
Are you now prepared to fulfill the bargain
arranged by my agent Sir
Bertram of Allenberg?
- Quite.
- Very well, then.
- There are 2 plans.
- 2 plans.
Plan 1, the untimely demise of Milords
Brockhurst, Finsdale, and Pertwee.
- Uh-huh.
- These three must die tonight.
Three for tonight. Proceed.
The method I leave to
you, but die they must.
Ha. They shall drop like flies.
Precisely. Like flies.
Do you have some sort of twitch?
Twitch? I twitch only for action.
I live for a sigh. I die for a kiss.
I like that very much.
Thank you. I lust for a laugh. Ha ha.
I never leap when I can walk. I never
flee when I can fight. Pardon?
Listen carefully. If plan 1
fails, you must execute plan 2.
Plan 2?
Take the princess from the castle before
midnight, by whatever means you may devise.
For murder or abduction, I'm your man.
You've paid the price, name your plan.
First, plan 1.
Are you sure you can dispose of Milords
Brockhurst, Finsdale, and Pertwee?
- Are they married?
- Yes.
Order flowers for the widows. Get it?
- Got it.
- Good.
Tally-ho! Ho ho!
- Master, I am back.
- Well?
I have climbed the thorny vine,
and the regal maiden is mine.
Good.
Now, when I release you from the spell,
you will fall into a deep
sleep and remember nothing.
Nothing.
Look into my eye.
Deeper. Deeper.
Ah, Milords, I
understand the marriage
of the Princess Gwendolyn to Sir
Griswold will be announced tonight.
My congratulations.
There's something afoot.
He's far too confident.
If this alliance fails, we are lost.
It must not fail.
Let us solemnly pledge that
we will permit nothing
to interfere with the marriage of
Griswold to the Princess Gwendolyn.
- I so pledge.
- And I.
Though it cost our very lives.
Our very lives.
Please stop your picking and fussing.
I must breathe some air.
But, madam, all afternoon
without a moment's peace.
I just learned of your whereabouts.
What happened?
Never mind that. You must
take the child to the Jester.
- To the Jester?
- Immediately. He has the key.
But he's under the,
silence. Take him the child at once.
It's my command.
But, but,
the Jester. Where is the Jester?
Summon him immediately.
Very good, Sire.
- Jester.
- Coming.
Come quickly, man. The King is waiting.
Yes, Sir. Have you seen Ravenhurst about?
He's somewhere about, yes.
Well, I was supposed to
see Ravenhurst on some
rather urgent business,
but I fell asleep.
I don't quite remember what happened.
Ah, Giacomo, a striking costume indeed.
From the Italian court, I presume.
Yes, Sire, Italian court.
What better place to, uh,
Ah, this will be a festive evening. Noble
knights to joust at my tournament,
come along, and by my
side, a lovely little wench
who I'm sure will fulfill every
promise of your discerning eye.
Ah, look at her.
Charming.
Charming, Giacomo, charming. A
tribute to you, my dear Giacomo.
Come here, my child. Come.
Your Majesty.
Was there ever more beauty? More radiance?
Rise, child.
The sweetness of your smile outshines
the elegance of your gown.
Thank you, Sire.
Would you attend me?
You're most gracious, Sire.
Quickly, use the key.
Key?
Remember, plan 1, Brockhurst,
Finsdale, and Pertwee.
Brockhurst, Finsdale, and per,
midnight, horses at the north gate.
Horses at the north gate.
Summon the Jester!
Where are you going?
Didn't you hear the King?
Uh, uh,
cover your head. Get in there.
Come, come, Giacomo. Let us be gay.
I would have a song.
Song? Has the cat your tongue?
Uh, no, I,
what do you carry there?
Why the basket?
Basket? Ha ha. What basket, Sir?
What basket indeed.
Come, boy, come. Show me
what you have in the basket.
Well, I,
come on. Show me what
you have in the basket.
And what about that song?
The s-song, Sire?
The, the song? Uh,

♪ I will tell about the basket ♪

Oh, Sire, it's nothing, Sire.
Merely a Jester's bag of tricks, Sire.
It's a secret, Sire. Yes.
A deep, dark secr, uh,

And just in time.
He comes not a moment too soon.
Bid Sir Griswold enter.

Save your breath, Griswold.
There will be no alliance

What's that?
I cannot marry Griswold, father.
I love another.

"G." Gwendolyn.
No, Sire. "G," Gia-Giacomo.
Shield me not, sweet Giacomo.
Our love makes me strong.
Love for a common Jester? Take
the swine out and hang him.
Harm one hair of that majestic head and
I throw myself from the highest turret.
Enough of this!
How much insult must I endure?
Come, men.
Hold, Sir Griswold, your
honor will be avenged.
How? Were that wretch of noble rank, I
would challenge him to combat mortal,
but I would not deign to soil my
blade with miserable common blood.
He's right, you know, Sire.
Rules of chivalry, you know.
Rules of chivalry be
hanged, and so will you.
- She'll jump.
- Fah! Come, men.
Hold, Sir Griswold. You
will stay until the morrow.
- It is my command.
- Till the morrow, Sire.
You, Gwendolyn, to your chambers.
Be brave, sweet Giacomo.
Throw this blackguard in chains.
Is he not fabulous?
To go from plan 1 to plan 2
without a moment's pause.
The man is pure genius.
Sir Griswold will never
tolerate this insult.
Milords, to your chambers.
Ponder this problem.
A solution must be found ere
we meet in council tomorrow.
Sire.
Welcome home, Sir Bertram. You
saw the Jester's performance?
Mm-hmm.
When I sent you to negotiate with Giacomo,
I never expected results like this.
Was he not brilliant?
Indeed,
with one slight discrepancy.
- This man is not Giacomo.
- What?
I know not this pretender, but I assure you
he is not the Giacomo I met and
negotiated with in Europe.
I tell you I've seen this man
before, and somehow, that maid.
What did I tell you?
What plan now?
To my chambers immediately.
But if he's not Giacomo, who can
he be, and what does he want?
Why would he do our every bidding?
Why would he work to destroy the alliance?
Why would he murder with
the cunning of a fox?
A fox,
but of course, a
fox, a Black Fox.
- But you don't think that,
- Why not?
Who else would oppose Griswold
and want the alliance destroyed
but that rabble in the forest?
The forest, that's
where I saw him,
dressed as an old man
riding into the forest
with the very wench who sat
beside the King tonight.
My lords, what a prize!
- The Black Fox himself!
- Expose him!
- You'll get all the credit.
- Not so fast.
Not until the fox pays us one last service.
He'll rid us forever of
the barbaric Griswold.
Kill Griswold? But how?
Whose is the deadliest blade in England?
Who is the only man alive who can
best Griswold in mortal combat?
- Only The Black Fox.
- But the fox is a commoner
and cannot fight in tournament.
We shall see.
No, Ravenhurst, I do not understand.
What do you mean, Griswold
himself suggested a solution?
You yourself heard him, Sire.
He said were the Jester of noble rank,
he would challenge him to mortal combat.
But the Jester cannot fight in tournament.
He's a commoner.
Then, Sire, knight the Jester.
Knight the Jester?
Griswold can then challenge him for
the hand of the Princess Gwendolyn,
and by the rules of chivalry,
she must wed the Victor.
Knight the Jester, Sir
Griswold will challenge him,
he dare not refuse, they meet
at the tournament tomorrow,
Sir Griswold's lance
runs the Jester through,
and the marriage and the alliance proceed.
Yes, hmm?
- Magnificent!
- Thank you, Sire.
But Your Majesty, knighthood
is an arduous ritual.
It would take 3 years to knight the Jester.
3 years? Nonsense!
Ravenhurst, take that nincompoop
and knight that nincompoop
by noon tomorrow.
Sire.
"By order of his Sovereign Majesty,"
"the Jester Giacomo shall
enter upon a series of tests"
"of manhood, skill, and courage,"
"requisite to his becoming
a Knight of the Realm."
Me, a knight? But why?
To make you eligible for the
hand of the Princess Gwendolyn.
M-marry the princess? Wh-when?
Upon your passing each and every test.
Oh. Well, that's different.
It takes 4 or 5 years to
become a knight, doesn't it?
We shall see. Let
the tests begin.
W-wait, what's the hurry? I'm,
"he must scale a stone
wall in full armor."
Yaah!
The candidate passes.
Duh, uh, I didn't,
"with longbow, he must slay
a hawk in full flight."
He passes.
- But I didn't even shoot,
- The candidate passes!
But I didn't shoot the arrow,
I, I didn't pass,
"the candidate must conquer a
wild boar with his bare hands."
Release the boar!
He passes!
No one enters, by the King's command.
But this<i> is</i> the King's command.
Ah, maid Jean, welcome. What
brings you here at this hour?
- Concern for you, Sire.
- Hmm?
You were so distressed last evening
that I thought perhaps I could comfort
you, ease the burdens of state.
Don't tug it, idiot!
That's very considerate of you, my dear.
I shall take advantage of your
delightful offer, perhaps, this evening?
Why tarry, Sire?
I am most accomplished
on matters of appearance
and would gladly free these young
men for more important chores,
elsewhere.
That's very kind of you, but,
oh, yes.
Pages, I'm sure you have some very
important business to attend.
Now then, Sire, we have to get
you ready for the ceremony.
- But, my dear,
- Now, there!
You can't imagine my feelings
when I touch the head of a man
who calls himself the King of
England, who is the King of England,
and very handsome, too, Sire, on
the day of your first tournament.
There you are.
Where?
Now I must go, Sire.
Now, wait, dear, wait.
Oh, no, you have to get to your ceremony.
There's no hurry. We can't start
- until the Jester's been made ready.
- The Jester?
Yes. Haven't you heard? We're
knighting the poor fool.
Knighting the Jester?
Yes. You'd never guess why.
So that he can marry the princess.
That's what the fool thinks, but
the moment I dub him knight,
Griswold will challenge him
for the hand of my daughter.
- In mortal combat?
- Yes, isn't it delicious?
He dare not refuse, they meet at lists,
and Sir Griswold's Lance
runs the Jester through
as a fitting climax to a glorious day.
Oh, my dear, you are a
delicate, lovely creature.
Tell me, does it bother you that I
may be a few years your senior?
Oh, no, Sire, not really.
In fact, you remind me so much of my
dear and recently departed father.
Your father, yes. Was he a handsome
figure of a man, dashing, attractive?
Oh, yes, Sire.
Till the scourge brought
about his untimely end.
- Come here, my dear.
- What a horrible death.
A little closer.
I can see him now, writhing
on the floor in agony,
like so many of his brothers and
cousins and uncles and aunts.
Would you grant the King a little kiss?
Oh, certainly, Sire. And don't worry.
They say it isn't catching.
Oh, you are a little...,
Catching?
Just because it runs in the family
doesn't mean that everyone has it.
Kiss me, Sire.
Has it? Has what?
Don't I please you, Sire?
Oh, yes, yes, but, these
brothers and cousins and uncles,
and aunts. Let us not talk about their
swollen, twisted, pain-ridden bodies.
Hold me, take me in your arms.
Tell me I am yours.
But this, this writhing on the floor,
in agony.
Yes. What, how does one catch this thing?
Oh, the touch of a hand,
the brush of a lip,
but let us not spoil this moment, Sire.
Hold me. Hold me close.
Uh, what's this monstrous thing called?
Breckenridge's scourge.
Who's Breckenridge?
My father.
You must excuse me, dear, I'm feeling,
feeling rather poorly.
Sire, the ceremony is ready.
Oh, very well. I must go
now, my dear, and so must,
so must you. Quickly.
Dear, don't touch anything.
Where's the Jester?
Get the key?
Yes, here it is.
It must be sent by pigeon
to The Black Fox at once.
Let the Jester take it and escape.
They plan to kill him.
It would never get there in time.
The bird's our only chance.
<i>He who approaches, deem you him
worthy of noble knighthood?</i>
Yea, verily, yea.
How many more before the Jester?
Just this one, Sire.
<b>Fealty, loyalty,</b>
<i>moisten his lips with the vigorous wine.</i>
Yea, verily, yea.
Yea, verily, yea.
<i>Now as the symbol of honor and dignity,</i>
<i>let us be plume him and helmet his brow.</i>
Yea, verily, yea.
Sire, this storm bodes ill.
It might drench the field
and delay the tournament.
Fetch the Jester
and run him through the ritual
as quickly as possible.
- But Sire, custom,
- Custom be hanged.
Fetch him and run him through.
<i>Let him prepare,</i>
a message for the Jester,
from the King.
He requests you do this at once.
At once.
<i>He who approacheth, deem you
him ready for noble knighthood?</i>
Yea.
Yea, yea.
<i>Hath he passed all tests of valor?</i>
Yea, verily, yea.
<i>Now doth he flower
with true nobility?</i>
Yea, verily, yea.
<i>Reveal him now to his sovereign liege.</i>
Yea, verily, yea.
- Yea?
- Faster.
- Faster.
- Faster.
Provide?
<i>Now as a symbol of fealty, loyalty,
moisten his lips with the vigorous wine.</i>
Yea, verily, yea.
<i>Now hath he pledged all
his fealty, loyalty,</i>
<i>courage and vigor and valorous strength.</i>
Yea.
<i>Now as a symbol of honor and dignity, let
us be plume him and helmet his brow.</i>
Yea, verily, yea.
Yea, verily, yea.
<i>He who is girded and plume and helmeted,</i>
<i>- let him prepare be now for his vow. </i>
- Yea!
<i>Let him encircled be now by his peers with
whom he will share all his glorious years.</i>
Forward.
That way!
Whoa!
No, I won't,
yeow! Ow!
No!
Aah!
Considering the virtuous
fidelity you have shown
and the honorable exploits
that you have done,
having given proof of that honor,
but, Sire, I didn't, it were not,
and always suffering, as is the part
of a good and faithful subject,
I hereby dub thee Knight of the Realm,
defender of the soil,
protector of the crown,
and a fit consort for the
Princess Gwendolyn the fair.
Arise, Sir Giacomo.
Now, if any knight present
objects to this marriage,
let him now step forward or
forever hold his tongue.
I.
I, Griswold of McElwaine, do so object.
Very good. You hear that, Sire?
I, too, love the princess and
would fight for her hand!
I hereby challenge in
mortal combat Giacomo.
- Hmm?
- Giacomo!
Knight of the Realm,
defender of the soil, and
protector of the crown!
Ooh!
You won't have to fight.
I'll send a message.
The Black Fox will come
and fight in your place.
- Black Fox?
- Get up.
Accept the challenge.
Uh, Black Fox, huh?
Yes.
He'll come and fight in my place?
Yes.
You're sure he'll come?
Yes.
Well, if it's mortal combat you want,
then mortal combat you shall have.
And at the hands of Giacomo,
Knight of the Realm,
defender of the soil,
protector of the crown,
protector of the crown!
Oh!
Ohh!
Heh heh.
Good stock.
Good battle.
Good-bye.
Your escorts, to see you
safely to the lists.
The lists?
Very clever, father.
Chivalry is chivalry, you know.
Yes, I know.
May the best man win.
Remember this.
If he dies, you die.
To the fox, at once.
We have bigger game.
Get him!
Sir! Griswold has challenged
the Jester to mortal combat.
- The Jester?
- Yes.
The maid Jean requests that you
come and fight in his stead.
The timbers have fallen and
great rocks block the passage.
- Can it be cleared?
- Impossible.
With no passage we can make no diversion,
and with no diversion, no attack.
Is there any opening?
No more than that, Sir.
Barely enough for a child.
A child, a child, or,
or perhaps, my horse!
Where go you, to save Hawkins?
No, to save England.
Then Hawkins must die.
Yes. But if my plan succeeds,
I assure you, Hubert Hawkins
will not have died in vain.
By order of his sovereign lord
highness, King Roderick the first,
this royal tournament is officially begun.
Where's The Black Fox? What's delayed him?
There's rain in the hills.
Perhaps the river is swollen.
He'll be taking the coast road.
You'd better have a look.
Good stock.
The first contest will
be a battle to the death
for the hand of the fair Gwendolyn.
It will be fought by Sir
Griswold of McElwaine.
And Sir Giacomo of Italy.
These 2 bold knights will choose weapons
and enter upon the field of honor
and fight in mortal combat
until one of them lies dead.
You must run for your life.
No. They'd,
they'd only catch me and kill me.
Can you ever forgive me?
There's nothing to forgive.
Dear Hawkins.
Sir Giacomo!
You should be in armor.
And you, maid Jean, in the stands.
If I die, just pray that I die bravely.
You will not die. You'll
not have to fight him.
Griswold dies as he drinks the toast.
What?
Listen, I have put a pellet of
poison in one of the vessels.
- Which one?
- The one with the figure of a pestle.
- The vessel with the pestle.
- Yes.
But you don't want the
vessel with the pestle,
you want the chalice from the palace.
I don't want the vessel with the pestle,
I want the chalice from, the what?
The chalice from the palace.
It's a little crystal chalice
with the figure of a palace.
Does the chalice from the palace
have the pellet with the poison?
No, the pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle.
Oh, the pestle with the vessel.
The vessel with the pestle.
What about the palace from the chalice?
Not the palace from the chalice,
the chalice from the palace.
Where's the pellet with the poison?
In the vessel with the pestle.
Don't you see? The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle.
The chalice from the palace
has the brew that is true.
It's so easy, I can say it.
Well, then you fight him.
Listen carefully.
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,
the chalice from the palace
has the brew that is true.
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,
the chalice from the palace
has the brew that is true.
- Good man.
- Just remember that.
Sir Giacomo.
Sir Giacomo, into your armor.
And you, to your place in the pavilion.
The pellet with the poison,
the pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,
the chalice from the palace
has the true that is brew,
eh, brew that is true.
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,
the chalice from the palace
has the true that is brew.
Eh, brew that is true.
Eh, the chestle with the palace,
look out!
Hurry now, get into your armor.
The pestle with the,
the pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,
the palace from the chalice
has the brew that is blue,
eh, no.
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,
the chal, the,
the pellet with the plip,
the pellet with the poisel's in
the vessel with the placel,
eh, the placel with the vlessel,
eh, the vless,
the vessel with the poisel,
come along, Sir Giacomo,
his Majesty's waiting.
The pestle with the poilet,
and take your helmet.
The pellet with the poisel,
thank you. The pellet with the,
the pellet with the poisely is from
the chalice with the pasley,
oh, hello, my dear.
It's nice to see you,
I've got it! I've got it.
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle,
the chalice from the palace has
the brew that is true, right?
Right, but there's been a change.
- They broke the chalice from the palace.
- They broke the chalice from the palace?
And replaced it with a flagon.
A flagon.
- With the figure of a dragon.
- A flagon with a dragon.
Right.
The pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle?
No. The pellet with the poison's
in the flagon with the dragon.
The vessel with the pestle
has the brew that is true.
The pellet with the poison's
in the flagon with the dragon,
the vessel with the pestle
has the brew that is true.
Just remember that.
Yes. Thank you very much.
The pellet with the chasley,
eh, the pellet with the poison is
in the passley with the chassel,
eh, just remember that.
Beware of the drinks.
One of them is poisoned.
Poisoned? Are you sure?
I heard the witch.
The poisel with the
plassley is the chacel,
the pellet with the poison's
in the flagon with the dragon,
the pestle with the pizzle,
the pizzle with the fff,
the, the, the,
no, no, no.
The pellet with the poisley
is the chalice with the,
the vessel with the pestle.
The vessel with the pestle
has the brew that is true.
Right. Don't forget it.
Pellet with the dragon,
no, no, no.
The knights will approach each other.
Uh,
the pellet with the poisel is
in the flagel with the chalice.
The poison's in the dragon with the pestle.
Eh, the chassel is in the
poisley with the plelace,
with the flam, the flaglace.
The pellet with the dragon's
in the pestle with the poi,
the pessley with the poisel,
the pizzle with the dragon,
the poisley with the placel,
the flaggley with the pizzle,
the chalice with the fl,
the flagon with the chas,
the poison with the flagon is
the chalice with the poisley.
The knights will face the King.
The poisley with the passley,
poiple passle pizzle,
the poison with the chalice
is the cha, puh-puh,
they will approach the royal pavilion.
The pellet with the poison's
in the flagon with the dragon!
The vessel with the pestle
has the brew that is true.
Oh, you, you've got the wrong one.
Stop this mockery! There
will be no toast.
Put them to horse. Let them
chose weapons and fight.
This is The Black Fox?
And still playing the fool.
Sir Griswold, declare a choice of weapons.
Mace and chain.
Sir Giacomo, declare a choice of weapons.
I'll take one of those, one of those,
a couple of those, and,
I better take them all.
Mace and chain for him, too.
Charge!
Take that horse and put
it back under that idiot!
Unfasten that girth!
Charge!
Ohh!
All right, Sir Griswold, prepare to die.
Go ahead, Sir Knight, slay me.
You won in fair combat. Strike!
Let rivers of blood wash away
the stain of my disgrace.
Go on! Spew the field
with my dishonored guts.
No.
No, I cannot slay a man
whose only crime is that he loved
not too wisely but too well.
I grant your life.
Take your men and go.
Fergus is dead.
Did he talk?
The child in the castle?
Now listen carefully.
There's little time.
Oh.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Sir Giacomo, I declare you
winner of this combat.
And I hereby decree that you shall
marry the Princess Gwendolyn.
Hold, Sire! Seize this traitor!
Traitor? What's this? How
say you, Ravenhurst?
I say traitor, Sire!
And I shall prove to you that
this man who stands before us
is neither Giacomo nor Jester,
but your deadly enemy,
the leader of the rabble who
have sworn to have your head,
The Black Fox himself!
Black Fox!
And this demure maid,
his foul accomplice.
Ravenhurst, are you mad?
- Have you proof of this treachery?
- I have, Sire.
Then repair to the court.
Summon the judges.
If what you say be true,
the headsman's ax
will not only rid us of this
jabbering popinjay,
but will sever this lovely little
head from this delicate little neck.
Oh. To the castle!
Hurry along, little friends.
Hurry along. Keep
your heads down.
Come along there, men. All of you.
We'll take the coast road,
but stay close to the trees.
And I say again, Sire,
never, Sire, never was there
such infamous treason.
Not only is this man The Black Fox,
but he and his despicable accomplice
had the shameful effrontery
to shelter in this castle
the miserable child
they would put on your very throne.
What's this? What say
you, Ravenhurst?
I repeat, Sire.
The child they would put on your throne.
The child,
with the Purple Pimpernel?
The very same, Sire.
Bring forth the basket!
Let me see this fraud, this charlatan!
Hurry up, hurry up. Bring it here.
In a moment, Sire.
But first, let me hear you pronounce
sentence on this unholy pair.
I know how anxious you are to
dispose of this villainous scum,
so that you may proceed with
the feast and the revelry.
Sire, I accuse these
impostors of the foulest
and most loathsome crime against the crown,
and I demand that they be given the
full measure of your righteous wrath,
and shall be disposed of
before another hour is passed.
I tell you, Sire,
the headsman's ax is too kind a
fate for these foul traitors.
They should be put on a spit
and roasted like yon boar.
Yes, yes. Death to both of them.
Father, I say Ravenhurst lies.
This is Giacomo, King of Jesters.
Never The Black Fox.
Nay, fair lady, for once
Ravenhurst is right.
I am,
I am The Black Fox!
Oh!
Guard that exit! Seize her!
Seize that traitor!
Ravenhurst, Ravenhurst, do something!
Do something!
Quickly, fetch Griswold. Bring him back.
Take him to safety.
Our men. I must raise the gate.
Stop him!
Quick. Lower the gate.
The gate<i> is</i> lowered.
No, it isn't. Look.
Aah!
If he dies, you die.
Tails of lizards, ears of swine,
chicken gizzards soaked in brine.
On your feet, be not afraid, you're
the greatest with the blade.
Ha ha.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey.
Play games with The Black Fox, will you?
At this very moment, my dear Ravenhurst,
your life isn't worth that!
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey! Ooh, hey!
Now, my gallant fox, we'll see
whose life isn't worth that.
We shall indeed. Hela!
With your permission.
Why, you swine.
Your health.
Ooh, you,
and now, Ravenhurst, you rat-catcher.
La!
La.
La. La.
La! Ha ha ha!
Aah!
Oh, you!
Oh, you!
Ha ha!
Well, my dear Ravenhurst, our
little game draws to an end.
I have toyed with you long enough.
You shall die, and
die like that!
Ooh!
Whoo whoo!
Aah!
Aah! Ooh!
Whaa!
Aah-yee, aah-yee, aah-yee, aah!
Aah!
Yah!
Oh! Yipe!
Hurry, help the fox.
Jean.
Oh, Hawkins, are you all right?
Never mind me. Where's the child?
Safe.
Good.
You've been wonderful.
How convenient. The
fox and his mate.
So, my friends, the tables
have turned yet again.
But this time for the last time.
And not only for
one, but for two.
- What a prize.
- Hey! - Hey!
Griswold.
They'll cut us to ribbons.
We've lost.
Hold, men, hold!
Let no more English blood be spilled.
Victory is ours!
Yay! Yay!
Not so fast!
Unhand the King. Surrender!
Never!
Then die a traitor to the crown.
Hold, Sir Griswold.
Hold your men.
Sir Griswold,
I speak to you as knight to knight.
When you were dubbed, you pledged
your hand, your heart, and your sword
to defend the true King of England.
Is that right?
Well?
This man is not the true King.
He has usurped the throne
from the legitimate heir.
Heir? What heir?
He who bears the mark of
the royal bloodline,
the Purple Pimpernel.
Purple Pimpernel?
Balderdash! No such person exists.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
