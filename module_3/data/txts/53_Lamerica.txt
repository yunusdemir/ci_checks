April 7th: 1939
Italian troops disembark
on the other side of the Adriatic
and the political union
between ltaly and Albania
is made in the name of Fascism.
The history of those days
is very significant.
April 12th: the Albanian AssembIy
decides to offer the King of Italy
the Albanian Crown.
April 14th: the government
sanction the new title.
ApriI 15th: the Fascist CounciI
approve the union.
April 23rd: Albanese Fascist Party
is founded at Tirana.
ApriI 29th: the AIbanese Council
decides union of both Armies.
After the union of Armed Forces,
other joint initiatives follow.
Courts are organised,
schools and hospitals founded.
RuraI health centres are created
to help peasants fight malaria.
There is Iand-drainage and roads,
housing for the peasants,
and at Iast, thanks to ltaIy
among the robust Albanians
civilization takes its place.
The landing at Durazzo
and the arrivaI of the Duce's men
who find throughout Albania
a most cordiaI and enthusiastic
welcome from the people,
awe-struck by the martiaI presence
of the Duce's guards.
Setting off immediately for Tirana
Ciano, the Foreign Secretary
is greeted with enthusiasm
as representative
of the great nation which ended
the misgovernment of King Zog
and the poverty of the people.
An account
which was waiting to be settled.
Italy, Italy, you are the world!
Hello, Mr. Fiore!
Hello, how are you?
- What a lovely car.
- How much does it cost?
A Iot...
Let's hurry, they're expecting
us at the Ministry.
You'Il get hurt!
When Albania was communist,
was like prison,
no one came in or
went out for fifty years.
Now foreigners can enter
but Albanians cannot go out.
Where would you go anyway?
You think they're waiting
for you in Germany or Italy?
Too much freedom
alI at once is not good.
- Who's in power now?
- Same as before.
They just change name, they get rid
of the older ones, the more corrupt
but people are hungry
and desperate.
You've been spoilt, the State has
always taken care of everything.
The truth is that the time has come
to rolI your sleeves up and get busy.
Don't get me wrong, I don't mean
you must do it aIl yourseIves...
But do you know
what Albanian salary is?
Ten dollars!
A doctor gets fifteen!
- There's no capitaI.
- The capital's coming...
Hope so...
These people come down
from the mountains
and from borders with Yugoslavia.
They walk for miles
and miles to get to port.
The police try to stop them,
but it's no use.
What do you need
all these bunkers for?
Our dictator Hoxha
feared Italian invasion,
so he bought 600 thousand
from communist China.
Know how many houses
that cement would make?
Yes, but Hoxha was mad,
he was dictator.
Dictator my arse!
It's brains you're lacking!
How the helI can you be starving?
With all this land, all
the oil and water you have...
the sea!
AlI this farmland, with intensive
farming you can harvest...
At Ieast three tons per hectare!
Will our friend see us today?
Yes, he's ready to sign contract.
Others will come if not...
Soldiers, eh?
Movement of troops?
- But the situation is under controI?
- Sort of.
Easy kids, easy, easy...
The best room.
Everything clean...
New curtains...
AI Bano and Romina sIept here.
- They big success in Albania.
- Good for them.
I chose these people speciaIIy
for you, aIl reIiabIe.
- Are they okay politically?
- Yes, anti-communist heroes.
How do you say "good morning"?
- Did you explain why we need them?
- Not yet.
- How come there's a woman too?
- She's very popular in Albania.
- She was first to push breast...
- Bust.
Our dictator's bust off the pedestal.
Tell them we'll see them later...
I'm going to take a shower.
I'm afraid no water today,
holiday today, maybe tomorrow.
They've got ltalian TV!
Do you like ltalian shoes?
Soft leather, modern manufacturing,
feet wrapped in velvet.
She say ltalian shoes best
in world, she see on television.
We must give every
Albanian a pair of shoes.
We'll use IocaI manpower
in the factory,
and choice Albanian
skins: lamb, kid, calf...
And you will be the chairman
of our company, Alba Calzature.
You're sure she isn't married?
Husband dead, she widow,
no children, no relatives,
sisters, brothers...
No mother and father,
she better than alI.
You'Il work with us
as from tomorrow, happy?
- Thank you, sir.
- Now give me a big smile.
Look, her name's Selimi, Iike him.
- Are you related?
- No.
Cousins of third degree.
Cousin of third degree.
I mustn't get angry.
I mustn't get angry.
I mustn't get angry.
So, we're trying
to be smart, are we?
Albania's got smart asses too!
- Send her away.
- First people with a degree!
Now your cousin! Are you
trying to pulI one over on me?
If she goes, I go too,
because I'm honest man.
She is my cousin, but distant
cousin, very distant.
No one's forcing us
to invest in this country,
we can just pack up and go home.
If you think I am dishonest
man, find someone else.
If it can't be done,
it can't be done, don't insist.
In my village there was an old
lady who begged in the streets.
And this man, to avoid taxes,
registered two hotels in her name.
Hotels... old woman...
Would you give money
to people with relatives
who would cheat you the day after?
Now do you understand what we need?
What do you calI them?
We need a man of straw...
Someone who'll do as we say.
That's not difficult with all
the poor people you have here.
Don't you have old people's homes?
Where do you keep old people?
The director asks why
we need this man we look for.
To shake western public opinion.
The man could be
the symbol of a new Albania.
He ask if he go on ltalian TV.
Of course!
Six months ago here work
only political prisoners.
They heroes because they fight
against communist dictator.
Here they are.
Now you see only disaster
but before, when prison
worked well, it was different.
It was modeI Iabour camp.
The previous director
was very strict on hygiene.
The prisoners made
their beds and
cleaned the room every day.
He's sick with arthrosis,
stomach, heart, everything.
Once they de-ratted every month.
It wasn't like this,
conditions much better.
- What's he saying?
- You have nice shoes.
Prisoners had to
take shower every day,
it was compulsory.
In evening there was inspection,
prisoners not clean were punished.
Because old director say:
"Men not clean have lice,
men with lice don't sleep well.
Men who don't sleep well,
don'twork well."
- What's he saying?
- Nothing important.
He say this place is dangerous.
He wants to clear
everyone out and set fire to it,
because there is danger
of disease and infection.
An epidemic even.
What kind of fucking place
is this? Please, don't touch me.
What do you want?
Please, don't touch me!
Please, let me through!
Let me through!
Get me out of here!
Get me out!
Every evening he take his stuff,
he say goodbye to his friends:
"I'm going home, I'm going home."
He goes to the gate,
stays there until it's dark
then comes back inside
and say: "Tomorrow I leave".
What's his name?
He frightened, he used to
interrogation of politicaI poIice.
Tell him we're not from the police!
Translate... friends!
He's soft in the head,
he could be illiterate.
Give me a pen.
Tell him to write his name.
Go on, write your name!
You see, he can sign his name.
- Spiro.
- Spiro Tozai.
What if he has family?
He has no one.
They wouldn't have left him here.
How old is he?
He's twenty.
He says he's twenty.
- What's this officiaI's name?
- Mr. Croce.
Kruja! Please, at least
don't get name wrong.
Mr. Kruja very pleased
democratic hero will
be chairman of your company.
Hero.
Chairman.
Congratulations.
He say you Italians are
very good to choosing chairman.
Everything okay, they take him.
Hear that, Mr. Chairman?
We've arrived, get out.
Do you Iike it here?
What have you done?
Get out!
Have you peed yourself?
I'll teach you! Come here!
- He's peed in the car!
- Doesn't matter, he old.
- Take him away!
- He suffered enough.
Just look at that!
Come here.
Clean the seat.
And clean it properly.
He's orphan...
How do you say that in English?
Your home.
Go on, go on...
Go on.
I told them it's a temporary
solution until we find him a home.
But if we give them a Iittle extra,
they'Il keep him here forever.
I liked him from the start.
He reminds me of my poor dead
father, he's just Iike him.
The communists
told you we were alI the same.
And I say we are not.
We are all different.
Different Iike the parts of our body.
What do we all have?
We have eyes to see
and ears to hear.
What do we need feet for?
We need them for walking.
Then we have a brain
to think with.
AII the parts are different
but alI necessary.
Well, that is how I'd
like this factory to be.
An organism of separate parts,
but everyone essentiaI.
Keep stilI.
Try this pecorino, it tastes
Iike ricotta, but it's good.
Not one piece of machinery
works here, not one.
Two years ago your father
and I went to Nigeria.
We bought an empty warehouse,
and formed a company.
Then we sent for some second-hand
electronic equipment,
and we set up
a nice television factory.
Called Niger Electronics
and we got a grant from
the Italian government.
- Did you make any televisions?
- Not one.
It's not our fault if Africans
have no knack for electronics.
Yes, but it's more likely
they'll check up on us here.
I'll be at the Ministry
in Rome tomorrow,
you stay here and
register the contracts.
Get the old man and
take him to see a doctor,
for a tonic or some vitamins.
You never know.
Do the Albanians believe
this story about investments?
The Albanians are Iike children.
If an ltalian said: "The sea is made
of wine", they'd go and drink it.
Good evening.
Sorry I disturb,
I look in room for you.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing serious.
Little bureaucratic problem.
Our bureaucracy is the same
as it was with communism.
What is it now?
The State commission wants
to meet the company chairman.
- Why?
- Small formality, more signatures.
We must take old man to Ministry,
to our friend Kruja.
He does everything,
you just bring old man.
Be here tomorrow morning at nine.
Sorry, I cannot, tomorrow
I busy with German company.
They buy villa in Velona near sea
to convert to Iuxury residence.
Very clever.
Albania is poor,
we have to do what we can.
Our music is good,
also the singer.
Have fun.
- How long has he been missing?
- I'm sure he had dinner last night.
- After that I don't know.
- What?
We left him in your care.
He can hardly walk, you were
supposed to look after him.
Please, keep your voice down,
people are praying.
Yes, praying...
How can he have disappeared?
- I'Il report you if he's hurt.
- This is not prison.
Mr. Tozai is not a child,
he go out if he wish.
That's not what we agreed, he was
supposed to stay here day and night.
We gave you a lot of money, now find
him or I'll get this place closed.
Our janitor is friend of Mr. Tozai,
maybe he know where he go.
Hey you!
- Where did you get that suit?
- Old man give me.
Where is he now?
He cry, he say:
"I want go home".
So I take him to train station.
When?
Not Iong, about half hour.
He take train for Scutari.
Where is the station?
- The station!
- Near here.
Behind building.
He crazy.
He want to go ltaly with train!
Stop! Take your hands off!
Stop!
Get your hands off!
Tell him Mr. Tozai's the chairman
of an Italo-Albanian company
backed by the Ministry of Industry.
Tell him also that Mr. Tozai is
a personal friend of the Minister.
Chief say: too few policemen,
too many criminals.
It is difficult to find
your friend, very difficult.
He's right...
I know it's difficult.
Perhaps we can come
to an agreement...
I'm prepared to pay you
for your heIp.
Understand? I'll pay for your help...
Chief say one hand wash other.
- He say he found old ltalian...
- No, I'm looking for an Albanian!
Your friend is in
that room down there.
He say he saved old man's life,
he bring to hospital.
Is it serious?
- I don't understand, speak ltalian.
- Ah, ltalian.
How do you say...?
Asphyxia
but not serious, better now.
- You family?
- No, of course not...
I'm ltalian.
He speaks Italian with me.
So? Everyone here speaks ltalian.
He say to me
that he has nice ltalian name.
Talarico.
Talarico Michele.
Spiro Tozai.
His name is Spiro Tozai.
He spent fifty years
in jail for politicaI reasons.
These are his papers.
This does not prove,
Albania was colony of
Mussolini before war.
What's Mussolini got to do with it?
Before war, many Italians here.
ltalians rule
in Albania with Fascism.
After war, communism.
So Italians in prison or...
- Executed?
- Executed.
So, many Italians
make false papers.
Maybe he was Italian before,
but he's AIbanian now.
What is he for Albanian law?
I not know law,
I am doctor, excuse me.
Can I take him with me?
Can he waIk?
He's worked in
a mine, he's strong...
- How much do I owe you?
- Nothing, this is pubIic hospital.
Thank God, at Ieast that...
Where are his shoes?
He had no shoes.
How am I supposed to take him away?
Could you get me
some shoes? I'll pay.
I am sorry, I cannot help.
I am sorry.
ltalian, cigarette?
Italian, friend.
Keep an eye on the car.
Good morning.
Have you got any coffee?
Is there a telephone?
A bathroom... a toilet...?
Get away from there!
Get out of the car.
Get your rags.
Police, watch the car...
Schiperi Socialiste...
Were they socialist or communist?
Who put you in jail,
the socialists or communists?
Did you meddle in politics?
Have you finished? If you pee in
my car again, I'Il kiIl you.
Wait, take it easy!
I'm friend, understand?
Easy, I help you
and you be good.
If you do as I say
nothing will happen to you.
We're friends...
Do you understand?
Perhaps it's best
you don't understand.
Wait...
Now you're chairman do you think
you can do whatever you want?
We bought you a new suit
and here you are in these rags.
What are you doing? Wait!
- Leave me alone.
- What did you say?
Did you say "leave me alone"?
How come you speak Italian?
Perhaps the doctor was right.
She said you weren't Albanian.
She said your name was Michele.
Michele!
What the hell are you?
Are you Albanian or ltalian?
Tell me who the fuck you are!
If your papers say you're
Albanian, that's all right by me.
You're not scared,
are you, Mr. Chairman?
You could fire me
if you wanted to, just relax...
Let's go.
What the...
Where's the policeman?
What happened to the policeman?
Where the fucking helI
is that poIiceman?
Who took my tyres?
You saw who did it,
you were right here.
You'd better come up with
those tyres or I'll report you!
I'm not leaving here
until I get my tyres back.
I'll have you all thrown in jail.
Do you understand me?
You'Il pay for this!
You miserable sods!
You tramps!
Bloody peasants! Wretches!
Fucking Albanians!
Police! I need to find
the police station!
Understand? Tyres are gone.
Car don't move! Police, understand?
Car without tyres don't move!
- Police, where?
- Police, there...
I can't go there,
I haven't got any tyres!
Fucking helI!
Wait!
Get off!
Wait!
Get off, come here!
Don't leave yet!
Stop, I want
to get off, shit-head!
You no say shit-head!
Take it easy...
What's your name?
My name is lsmaiI.
Please meet you.
I like ltaIy, I like ltaIians.
I friend of Italians: Pippo Baudo,
Frizzi, Adriano CeIentano.
I aIways see Italian TV, even
if communism not permit before.
You only sing Italian song
and you go prison.
Communism say:
"You sing ltalian song?
Then you see Italian teIevision.
If you see ltalian
television, you spy."
- And you, no prison?
- No.
I am clever, I am crafty.
War is ugly, eh?
You must
leave your family...
When I Ieft
Rosa
she cried.
She was expecting a baby.
I said to her: "Don't cry,
I don't want to go to war".
I'll run away.
I'll come back to you, Rosa.
Who is more important in ltaly,
the Pope or the President?
- What do you think?
- I think Pope.
On television always see Pope,
President not so much.
Our dictator say:
"Religion is bad for people".
First he outlaw religion here,
but now I go ltaly
I become Christian.
Christians can find
work in ltaly, right?
Of course!
Where do you live?
Milan, Rome, Bari?
Police stop bus, they don't want
us go port and take ship.
Police!
Police!
I'm ltaIian!
The tyres of my car was stolen!
- Listen!
- Where is your car?
- Somewhere over the hills.
- Go there, we can't do anything.
What do you mean?
You're the police, aren't you?
I'm a foreigner, you must help!
- How far is it to Tirana?
- What?
On foot, one day.
Why on foot? What's this?
Bus don't leave
any more, it's sequestered.
Government order that Albanians
not escape to Italy anymore.
How can I get to Tirana?
That's your business!
Come on, let's go!
- Poor people...
- Come on, stop that!
- They'II kiII me.
- Who'Il kiIl you?
- What are you talking about?
- They'll kill me.
What? Who's going to kilI you?
The militia.
What militia? Come on out!
- Come on!
- Poor people.
If you stay here, they'Il kiIl you.
I'm going.
If you come with me
nothing wilI happen to you.
Come on.
Let go, we're Italians!
Poor people, poor people...
Keep walking!
Paisa',
thanks, you saved my Iife.
If the militia had found me,
they'd have shot me.
Can I teII you something?
I haven't been discharged,
I ran away from the war.
I'm a deserter.
Paisa', I'm from Sicily.
My name's Talarico Michele.
Fraud...
I have a wife and child.
I must get back to Sicily,
but I don't know the way.
I'lI foIlow you,
that way I won't get lost.
Where are we now?
Is it very far to SiciIy?
Keep walking!
Do you want to eat?
What's that written
on the mountain?
Can't you read either?
"Duce, Mussolini",
that's what's written on it.
We must be somewhere in Abruzzo
or maybe not,
we're near Rome.
Where are we?
In NapIes.
In Naples? Do you think I'm stupid?
Naples is on the coast.
Where's the sea?
They've bombed...
Maybe they've bombed Sicily too.
No, the Lord can't do this to me.
I want to see my son.
He was born the day
I left for the war.
I left in the morning and
the rascal was born that evening.
They wouldn't even Iet me see him.
He'II have grown, he'lI be waIking,
maybe he's asking about me.
He must be about three.
No, I'm wrong, he's four.
Do you think he'lI recognise me?
Have you finished?
You old fooI!
Do you know how old you are?
Haven't you looked in the mirror?
The war ended fifty years ago.
You haven't got a baby son.
Your wife's probably dead!
Idiot.
What have you got to drink?
Mineral water, coffee?
No coffee, no water.
Water tomorrow morning.
Ok, 265,000 Iire, the price
is right, Signor CIaudio wins!
Something to eat? Bread, cheese...
No food, drink, Raki Fernet...
Here, you want eat?
- Take it, very good cheese.
- No.
You don't like Albanian food?
- How much do you want?
- I don't want anything.
1,000 lire, friend.
Friend, 1,000 Iire.
Hey, ltalian, 1,000 lire.
1,000 Iire, ltaIian.
Friend, 1,000 Iire.
1,000 Iire, ltaIian.
Friend, 1,000 Iire.
Bread and cheese.
Eat it, it's fresh.
I'll leave it here,
maybe you'll eat it later.
What are you doing?
Are you trying to piss me off again?
What are you crying about now?
Eat this bread.
Look, if you carry on Iike this,
I'm not taking you to Sicily.
I'll leave you here.
How will you get there without me?
How will you get home?
Come on, eat up.
Take it easy.
A big man Iike you crying Iike
a baby, you shouId be ashamed.
It's good, eat it up.
See? You were hungry.
If you don't eat
you're bound to feel bad.
Everything all right?
The lorry's due, we'Il be
in Reggio CaIabria in a few hours.
Then we board
the ferry and we're home.
I'm from Sicily too.
Mr. Chairman,
what's your son called?
His name's Giovanni.
And how old is he now? Three?
He's almost four.
He's a big boy then.
Think how happy
he'll be to see you.
There'lI be another along soon.
Let's wait.
Let me try these.
- Where are you from, ltalian?
- Sicily.
Is Sicily near Bari?
Have I slept long?
Where are we?
Have we passed Naples yet?
Is it true that everyone has
water and a telephone at home?
They give us house
when we come to Italy?
I see on TV that you have roads
where only cars go, no bicycIes,
only cars that go very fast.
Motorways!
- You pay for roads?
- Yes, in ltaly you pay everything.
- Also women if you want.
- I know the women you pay.
They alI whores.
Italian whores are beautiful, eh?
Pleased to meet you,
Talarico Michele.
I'm going home to Sicily,
where are you going?
Don't you understand dialect?
- Where are you going?
- To the port, to take the ship.
To Naples... you're going to America?
You need money to go to America.
No money, we board ships.
You wish!
You have to have permit
to go to America,
otherwise they don't
Iet you off the ship.
Before the war, when my parents Ieft
they had a permit.
They settled down there.
They went to New York,
to Patterson, to Argentina.
They began to work.
They started to earn
money and even built a house.
It's a different story over there.
Which team is best,
Juventus or Milan?
Neither of them.
You wrong, Juventus much, much
better, they have Schillaci.
- Where you Iive, Torino?
- No.
- Torino is near Bari?
- Yes.
He is good footballer,
he go to Juventus.
If Juventus not take me,
I go Milan.
I train every day, also
at night, I am never tired.
Football is best job in ltaly.
Make more money than everyone!
Yes, footballers...
If you're lucky you'll
get jobs as dish-washers.
There are enough Moroccans,
Poles and black people...
Come to ltaly...
No problem, we do anything.
Better dish-washer in Italy
than starve in AIbania.
What's the matter with you?
Don't you feel well?
Are you traveI sick?
Hang on,
we're almost there.
Let me sing
with my guitar in my hand
Iet me sing a song,
softIy, softly.
Let me sing
because I'm proud
I'm an ltalian,
a true ltalian!
What's this song?
Do you know "Rosamunda"?
Sing it with me.
What's the matter with you?
What is it?
Hey, friend!
Where are you going?
What do you do if lorry goes back?
You want to walk?
Will you leave me alone, please!
I want to come with you.
Wake up, what's up with you?
In ltaly no one die like him.
Young people in ltaly
die only in car accident.
But I die an oId man.
Hey, friend, an Italian
girI can marry an AIbanian?
Or there's Iaw that say no?
Now that I come to ltaly,
I find girl in Bari.
I want to marry
and have many chiIdren.
I never speak AIbanian with
my children, only Italian.
So my children forget
I am Albanian.
Wake up.
Eat this bread.
It wiIl do you good.
Hurry, friend, Iorry Ieave!
We bring dead boy with us,
we Ieave in first town to bury.
This not hotel anymore,
people occupy it.
Here Iive women, chiIdren, men,
families, but no one pay.
Evacuees? Have they
bombed here too?
No bombs, only shooting.
They take gun and shoot
communist party Ieaders.
This is vacant room.
One room, two persons,
you pay two persons.
We'Il pay, we'lI pay...
They send us to fight a war
promising food
and work
for everyone.
Instead
we're even hungrier
than we were before.
Things must change.
When we get
home,
they'II change.
They'Il change.
You like IittIe girI?
You take her to Italian television.
- Put that down.
- I'm helping these peopIe.
Then they'Il give us
some bread and cheese,
so we'lI have food for the journey.
Leave it...
How are you?
I left you some miIk,
did you find it?
Has your temperature gone down?
Yes, I drank the milk... and you?
You haven't eaten anything.
Go on, you eat something too.
It's expensive here,
where wilI we get the money from?
Don't worry.
You mustn't worry about money
anymore, get that into your head.
You've got money now.
You're a company
chairman, understand?
What's a chairman?
Someone who does
a nice comfortable job.
Every so often we bring
you papers to sign.
Like last time, name and surname?
You sign them, then
your work's finished.
So why did you choose me
for the job?
Because the chairman's
role is a delicate one.
You can't trust
just anybody these days.
We needed an honest person Iike you.
Thank you.
What do I owe you in exchange?
Nothing.
Just keep quiet about it.
Don't go round telling
everyone you work for us.
People are envious.
Eat up.
I'm glad I met you.
ltaly, ltaly, booth three!
Hello, this is Gino
ringing from Albania!
Can you hear me?
Gino calling from Albania!
Can you hear me? Speak louder!
We got cut off!
How can this possibly work?
- You speak here.
- I'll wait.
- Is the phone broken?
- No...
We'lI speak to him.
When he calls...
When it rings we'Il speak
with the office
and tell them
you've agreed to be chairman.
Are you pleased?
But you have to start
work right away, know that?
Tomorrow you have
to sign your name four times,
and you've earned
your month's salary.
You can speak to the boss,
do you remember Fiore, my partner?
You can say hello to him.
I don't know how to use the phone.
What? There's nothing to it.
Hello, is that ltaly?
Hello, Fiore?
Fiore, thank God...
It's Gino from Albania.
I hope we don't get cut off.
I'll be at Tirana tomorrow, I'll
take the old man to the Ministry.
So much has happened here.
Everything's all right, don't worry.
Now then...
Are you phoning too?
Have you got relatives abroad?
Have they got a phone at home?
What's wrong?
Have you received bad news?
Has something happened
to your family?
Shut up.
Tell me, maybe I can help.
You're no Ionger chairman.
You've lost your job,
that's what's happened.
I knew it.
I thought it over.
How can you earn a living
just signing papers?
Thank you anyway, my friend,
even if you can't give me
a job any more.
I'm out of a job too.
It's over...
..all over.
We're fired,
both of us.
We're both young, aren'twe?
We've got arms.
When we get to my village
we can eat, have a wash, rest,
and we'Il stiII have time
to do a day's olive picking.
Well, how much do you want?
Make your mind up, I'm in a hurry.
He's a quiet man,
he's never given any bother.
You can put him to work, he's as
strong as a man half his age.
He sleeps, occupies bed,
eats everyday,
but Albania is poor.
Albania poor... here, take this.
Why don't you take
to ltaly, take him home?
Why?
Because he's not Italian,
he's Albanian,
he's got all the papers.
His name's Spiro Tozai.
He fought against communism,
he spent fifty years in jaiI.
Now this is a free country you
should be grateful to men like him.
We were better off
before, with communism.
Here, take it...
Where is the old man then?
Over there.
A little cinema!
I've never seen such a smaIl cinema.
Have you seen how
nice this place is?
They've even got a cinema.
You don't even have
to pay to watch.
When are we Ieaving here?
Don't you like it here?
There are a Iot of peopIe here.
Many families, children...
All nice people.
The place is big.
And the food's not bad, is it?
The cheese was tasty.
So...
why not stay here for a while?
That way you can have a rest.
You've got a bed,
a room of your own,
meals every day.
What more could you want?
You're better off here than at home.
But I have a home.
I can't take you home.
There are too many problems now.
But I've spoken to the owner here,
he's a kind man.
He'lI take you to Sicily.
What will you do?
Don't worry, I'lI keep in touch.
I'll come and see you in Sicily.
Have I done anything wrong?
Why have you lost heart
now we're almost there?
We should go to Sicily together.
I won't Iet you go aIone,
now that you need help.
I don't need anyone, Mr. Chairman.
I'm ltalian, I'm staying
in the hotel! Let me through!
I don't understand, Iet go of me!
Let go of me, I'm ltaIian!
Let go of me!
You've got the wrong man,
it's nothing to do with me.
What have I done?
Open this door, I'm Italian!
I'm ltaIian, don't you understand!
Is this what you call democracy?
Is this what it means to you?
You're stilI communists!
You've not changed at alI!
Aren't you drinking it?
Don't you Iike Turkish coffee?
I don't Iike it either,
I like ltaIian coffee, espresso.
My father Ioved Italy.
He studied art at Florence
in Vittorio Emanuele's time.
You know that church...
Santa Maria Novella?
He told me it's beautiful, is it?
Yes... where are my bags?
I gave my cIothes away.
This Albanian prison
is a nasty place.
Your bags have been sequestered.
What do you want from me?
Name, surname and place of birth.

January 30th, 1963.
Have you anything to do with this
company called Alba Calzature?
I work for them.
I work with them.
Just answer yes or no, please.
Yes.
Were you there when this
was signed at the Ministry?
Yes.
Everything's in order,
isn't it? It was alI legaI.
Mr. Croce was there
too, you can ask him...
No, not Mr. Croce, Mr. Kruja!
This man is now
in worse prison that this.
What have I done?
What am I accused of?
You are accused of corruption
of this official.
In communist time,
you would be shot.
Corruption, shooting...
What do you mean?
You're still not
used to western methods.
That's how things work in ltaly,
to speed up bureaucracy.
We help the cases move quicker.
It makes it more efficient.
It's better.
We're businessmen.
The Albanian economy is at a crisis.
The people are starving
so we risk our money,
we invest our own money.
Albanian economy is dead,
but in civilized country dead
are not left to dog in street.
Let me calI the Embassy.
Call them.
Call them.
There are only Albanians
in Italian Embassy.
Refugees who have
occupied alI embassy.
They are crazy.

and I'Il reIease you tilI trial.
UntiI trial?
What wilI happen at the triaI?
I interested in sending
to prison corrupt officiaI.

Sit down.
I'm so happy you're on board too.
We can travel together.
How are you?
We've both been very unlucky,
but we have to keep heart.
Have you seen alI these people?
I didn't think they'd all get on.
But America's a big place!
Some have brought their families
but Giovanni
is too young
it would be too much for him.
Rosa too
is delicate
she always has a fever.
Paisa',
can you speak American?
I can hardly speak ltalian.
Do you think we'lI
find a job anyway?
I'm tired.
But I want to be awake
when we reach New York.
