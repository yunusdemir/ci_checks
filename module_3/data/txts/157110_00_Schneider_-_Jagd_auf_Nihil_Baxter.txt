What's Tuesday got to do with it?
Tuesday is a lucky day. Didn't you know?
I'm not doing it.

Ramon?
Little Ramon..
Breakfasts ready.
What day is it today?
- Tuesday.
What time?
Quarter to ten.
Shit!

You tell me now?
- I'd forgotten. lsn't that normal?
Nadine!

<i>How clean do you want to be'?</i>
I am sad.
- Sad? Why?
I thought this was a serious relationship.
- It is.
Prove it then.
- How could I prove it'?
Introduce me to her.
- Not today.
You're ashamed of me.
- No, but I've got a strange daughter.
Who matters more to you, her or me?
You, but with her
I have a whole history.
Delete history,
like when you've been watching porn.
Get dressed.
I mean nothing to you anymore?
- When I get to ten you'll be gone.
One, two...
Hovv do I get home?
Bastard!
Yes?
- Do you know more now?
I'm at the pumping station now.
It's all seized up.
I'm waiting for the technicians.
So it could take time?
- Yes, don't count on me for help. Sorry.
<i>Don't</i> worry about <i>me.</i>
- <i>OK. See you later.</i>
Bye, darling.
Francisca.
Been here long?
- Fifteen minutes.
The door was locked.
Why didn't you ring?
- I did, but you had earphones on.
How are you'?
- Fine.
And you?
- Yes, fine.
Is it a year since I saw you last'?
- Something like that.
Cup of tea?
- Yes, of course.
<i>Where</i> are you?
- Why do you ring me? it's most unusual.
<i>Where are you'?
- On my way.</i>
l-low far from your target'?
No idea. I'm on the other shore
among the reeds.
Let me know
when you spot the summer house.
Mom says you are writing.
That's true.
What are you writing, a novel?
- Yes.
What is it about?
- What all novels are about:
Fate, love...
Who was your visitor?
- Why?
I had a meeting.
Who with?
- An editor.
An editor.
- An editor, yes.
An editor in a skirt?
- Indeed.
With coke and weed by the looks of it.
- Yes, to add to the fun.
Still? Do you still need that?
Come off it, Francisca.
I do coke now and then. I smoke a joint.
You eat muesli. I never comment on it, do I?
Muesli is healthy.
- I don't think so.
Muesli makes me depressed.
Muesli is for goats.
Shall we stop it, Daddy?
- We'? You started.
You haven’t been here ten minutes
and you're already checking up on me.
What are you doing here?
- I'm a bird watcher.
You're not allowed here.
It's a protected area.
Is that white delivery van yours?
- Yes.
If you drive on,
you will get to the free sector.
I've never seen you here before.
I've never been here before.
<i>And?</i>
You said he was on his own.
There's a weeping woman with him.
A weeping woman?
- Yes, a woman who is weeping.
Young or old?
- What do I care!
Your information sucks.
You didn't say this is a protected area.
Protected... does that make a difference?
<i>I was sent away by a warden.</i>
Is that a problem?
- I have to start all over again.
Why all over again?
I'm in disguise
and I've been seen in it.
You're in disguise?
Yes, in disguise.
Don't pretend you didn't know.
I always work in disguise.
Disguised as who?
- As somebody else.
He wrote down my registration number
or I expect he did.
<i>I've got to go back for a new disguise
and a different car.</i>
<i>My own car in other words.</i>
A fucking damn nuisance, Mertens!
I don't want to be phoned again.
It will be done, but in my way.
That woman has to go
or I vvon't do anything.
Goddammit.
I'm all emotional, Dad.
Everything went wrong last year.
Nothing of what I wanted to do went right.
Have you spoken to Cato?
To Cato? What do I need Cato for?
To start with, she's your sister...
- So What?
She has all the luck
While she is living the high-life.
That's why you should talk to her.
You're too rigid.
You want everything planned.
Cato goes with the flow.
Why are you bringing Cato into it?
- Cato can help you.
But Cato isn't here. You are here.
You've got to help me.
You are my father.
You're not making yourself clear, girl.
You're fucking around with me.
Just like that
you start fucking around with me.
Is it strange that I get mad?
Is it strange...
...I'm asking.
How many slaps have I given you in all'?
Twenty?
OK, maybe twenty-five.
Spread over two years.
Is that so terrible?
But What have I done for you?
No mention of that.
I got you out of the shit.
One hundred percent pure shit.
Don't be scared.
I want you to show yourself.
I want you not to scream...
...not to cry and I want you to say:
Sorry, Bolek.
You go.
I take your hand, I give you a kiss
and we walk out of here.
Go give him a kiss
and leave the building.
I'm not going to look for you, Gina.
He'll hurt me.
- I don't think so.
If you don't come, I'll go.
- If he takes action, I'll help you.
He's armed.
- Forever, baby.
Just go.
Come into my arms, Gina.
Ah, there you are.
Are you going to stay there?
What are you going to do?
- What I promised: give you a kiss.
I don't know, Bolek.
- Don't fuck around. I'm letting you make up.
Come on, I've got things to do today.
A light punishment is in order,
don't you think?
This comes at a very unsuitable moment.
Why didn't you hide somewhere else?
- This door was open.
Who is that jerk?
A friend.
- Your pimp, you mean.
What were you doing in this area?
- Nothing.
I don't even know What town I'm in.
- Where are you two from?
Culemborg.
- An hour's drive.
Without knowing Where you're going?
He had to see a business contact.
I came along for fun.
For the fun of it?
We quarreled.
I ran away at a traffic light.
Where is that car?
Why don't you smoke a nice joint?
That'll calm you clown.
As a medicine.
- I need more to get out of this dark pit.
I know, but you'll have to be calm first.
Hash makes me paranoid.
It's Weed, a light, gentle Weed.
- Thanks but no, Dad.
I'll try again: Mogadon, a tranquilizer.
No.
Sedatives make you fat.
Do you Want me to be fat?
Rohypnol.
- Another sedative.
Did I come here to sleep?
- What's Wrong with sleep? Does you good.
I'm trying to help you.
- With drugs.
Is that all you can offer?
- Some muesli then?
Are you pulling my leg?
- Yes, I am.
You don't Want to be helped.
You're enjoying your dark shit pit.
Come on, Francisca. I sympathize
with you, but I'm not a psychiatrist.
You don't ask any questions.
You take no interest in me.
You want to work on that book of yours.
Not at all, but I had
different expectations of this day.
I expected a daughter in good spirits.
But a totally different daughter turns up.
A daughter in good spirits?
You know me, don't you?
Life doesn’t look kindly on me.
That isn't always so, is it?
- Nearly always.
I don't know how it's done, Daddy.
How what is clone'?
Living.
That's why I said: Talk to Cato.
- Whats all this bullshit about Cato?
Cato is in Egypt!
Just calm down first.
- Calm me down then.
You refuse to be calmed down.
I've offered you plenty, goddammit.
In the past you used to comfort me
with a story.
About Pixie Edward, remember?
Yes, I remember.
He had only one leg, yet he was happy.
You might follow his example.
- You can't stop, can you'?
So tell me, Daddy, about Pixie Edward.
Now, at this very moment?
- Yes.
It makes me happy.
I can't remember any of it,
ifs so long ago.
Where did he live, for instance?
- In the dunes.
Tell me, Daddy.
You're talking to somebody else?
- Francisca, this is important.
No, you're talking to me now.
Fuck off.
A short call. We'll carry on in a moment.
Hang on. I'm going outside.
Thanks for your Wonderful story!
What's up?
- I must get my things.
I'll bring them tomorrow.
You think that's still up to you?
I'm coming round.
Didn't you hear? My daughter is having
a nervous breakdown.
I worTt be on my own. I'm bringing Jules.
Jules?
Who is Jules?
- A friend who'll kill you with one thumb.
I don't Want to die.
- I'm not killing you, only anesthetizing.
You vvon't remember.
- I Want to stay awake.
You're an obstacle.
- I want to go home.
What do you prefer, meat or fish?
- I prefer fish.
How are you getting on'?
- Not too well.
I'll spare you the details. it'll take long.
I'm not getting flustered.
If you're not flustered it'll all be OK.
Are you getting flustered?
- No not at all
<i>Bye svveety-pie of mine.
- Bye darling.</i>
Francisca...
Come on, we'll sit nicely outside.
This is an impossible situation.
Come on out.
- No.
This little room is big enough for me.
I've got good medication.
Stop thinking only of yourself.
Who is only thinking of himself here?
You want a fat, lazy daughter
so you can work on your novel.
I Want us to have a good time together.
Doing drugs and boozing on the jetty
you mean.
Bax.
- There's a woman with you.
Yes, my daughter.
Is that your business?
Have you lost your senses?
He's coming. He's on his Way.
Who is on his way?
- Who do you think?
Is this man Schneider on his way?
- Yes.
But isn't that next week'?
- Today. Tuesday.
Shit.
Jesus, have you been doing drugs again?
- My daughter is depressed.
Get rid of her.
- Call that man Schneider back.
We'll do it tomorrow.
- No Way.
How much time have I got'?
<i>I don't know, maybe half an hour.</i>
<i>Do you hear me?</i>
What?
- Has it sunk in?
Yes.
I'll let you know his position.
Goddammit.
Francisca.
Francisca.
I give no further information.
I can't work like this.
<i>When it's done, / I'll let you know</i>
- <i>What</i> do <i>you</i> think <i>I'm doing?</i>
Pestering me.
I can drive Bax into your arms.
No <i>need</i> to.
- Don't you want to get home early?
<i>Not at the cost of my safety.</i>
Just listen to me first.
Do you want to know or not?
I'm listening.
<i>I know Bax.</i>
I can phone him
Without raising suspicion.
Opposite his front door ifs all reeds.
You can take up position there.
I talk him out of the house.
You just pull the trigger.
You still there?
<i>Sounds too easy.
- Good ideas always do.</i>
I want it to succeed, get it?
I don't know, Mertens.
What's stopping you?
Are we agreed or not'?
Yes.
<i>And get rid of the weeping woman.
- She's his daughter.</i>
All the more reason.
Make sure she leaves.
If I see her ifs off.
- No problem.
<i>Where are you?
- St. Peter's Church.</i>
I'll get back to you.
Francisca?
I'm running out of time, Francisca!
For Gods sake, stupid cow.
It's getting dangerous here.
Where are you?
- Problems with my daughter.
<i>Is she gone?</i>
- <i>Yes. Where</i> is <i>Schneider?</i>
Ten minutes ago at the church.
Not much time.
<i>Are you clear-headed?</i>
<i>Do you hear me?</i>
Mertens, still there?
I am. Are you?
- Yes, I'm still there.
<i>Are you clear-header)', / asked
- Yes.</i>
<i>Listen closely.</i>
I told Schneider
I'll talk you out of the front door.
<i>He 'll fake up position opposite that.</i>
- I know enough.
One more thing. He's disguised.
<i>As what'?
- No idea.</i>
Take care. He's clever.
Why do you Want him dead anyway?
He's a child killer.
The weeping Woman is gone.
Where are you?
At the Water tower.
He's at the Water tower now.
The bastard.
I knew it.

Don't do that.
You're staying here.

You look like a madman.
You're staying.
- For Gods sake.
Are you a moron?
Jules has to go to the hospital.
Where's Grandpa? What's happened?
Has the bastard been touching you?
Where is he?

Jesus man, as a kind of punishment?
I vvasn't thinking. I'm sorry.

I stabbed him.
Dead or wounded?

It's all right.
Where did you leave him?
- In the swamp.
It's all right, darling.
Take it easy. Grandpa is a bastard.
Listen, did you hide him Well?
Really deep?
Calm down now.
I can't calm down, Daddy.
L-low can I go on living?
I'll give you something.

Yes, that's his name.
According to Mertens.
Who is Mertens?

Stay put, there aren't any crackers.
You can't search.
No crackers.
<i>The phone you're dialing
may be switched off.?</i>
<i>Please try again later.</i>
You're not allowed to be here, Ma'am.
Why?
- It's a protected area. If you just...
Dammit.
Can I go home?
It's here. Go left at the skip.
Give me your foot.
What?
- Give me your foot.
Why?
- Give me your foot, I say.
What's that?
An explosive.
In case you Want to run away.
You're getting 1O minutes.
If you're not back...
...I press the button.
Is that for real?
- You bet it is.
But I'll be straight back.
I take no risk
with a Whore from Culemborg.
What happens if you press?
- Your lower leg goes.
Now go, get out of the oar.
What if I can't help being late?
That's bad luck. Now get out!
And remember: you don't know me.
You're a walker and you're thirsty.
All you have to do
is get her to leave, you hear?
Or she's a goner.
Your time starts now.
Would you have some Water for me?
Of course. I'll get it.
Where are you?
Under the bed.
Whats up with you?
- It'll pass. What does she Want?
Glass of water.
You're in danger.
Excuse me?
- You're in danger. You must go.
Who are you?
- You must leave.
I don't like this.
- Go, or you'll be dead before sunset.
Is this a joke?
It's a message.
- Who from?
You're from Schneider.
- If you don't leave, you're dead.
Thanks for the water.
Thanks for the water.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Can't this man Schneider just go home?
- I must go.
What has my father done?
- I don't know.
Can't we talk it over?
I have only one thing to say:
You are in danger. Leave this place.
I can't leave him alone.
- I've told you. Now I must go.
If I keep you here, will Schneider help you?
- I know ho Schneider.
Goddammit.
Schneider won't rescue me.
Look at my ankle.
What's that?
I've got two minutes.
Then he'll blow me up.
Things aren't going well, Dad.
Come...
I've done my best.
She's not leaving?
- No.
Can you take it off?
Here... sugar water.
And drink it all.
Eat that.
Eat!
Eat!
- Could you be more quiet?
Quiet? We're in a hurry, Daddy.
Eat.
There was a Woman at the door just now.
Remember that?
Yes.
- Yes?
Schneider sent her
so she'd tell me to leave.
But I stayed, as you see.
I can't keep this in.
- Do you get What I'm saying?
Yes.
Why does Schneider Want to kill you?
If you don't answer me, I'm off.
It's not interesting.
Bullshit. Answer me.
It's a trap.
I have to liquidate him.
Mertens was going to drive him
into my arms. Something Went wrong...
...and now he knows I'm Waiting for him.
So you're a contract killer?
You kill people for money.
- I need some alcohol.
Let's have a drink and be cheerful.
Cheerful? Clear your head
and take the lead again.
Don't you fucking see
What situation we're in?
What are you going to do?
- Barf.
Feeling any better?
Get into the boat.
Sit down.
Listen, you're less to me
than a bag of shit.
But I'm giving you a chance.
You get onto the lake.
Bax will think that you are me.
You've got two bullets to kill Bax.
Don't think you can escape.
I'm going to keep you under cover.
I'll shoot your brain out
if you make a funny move.
If you kill Bax, you're free.
I don't have a chance.
- I agree.
Daddy!
Is it him?
I can't tell, really.
I don't know.
- Shoot into the boat first.
It's not Schneider.
Lie low.
Let the daughter live.
I can't.
She's a Witness.
If I let her go, I've had it.
I've got young children.
You could at least think about it.
Who was it?
- Mertens.
The man from the south
who rides a goat at night?
What do you mean? Mertens is the client.
Client gone, job gone. We're off.
- No, you're wrong.
Client gone, job gone. We're off.
- No, you're wrong.
Schneider wants to kill us both,
sooner or later.
You think so, I don't. Mertens was
the traitor. He's been punished.
Schneider and I have nothing to settle.
Schneider wants the job finished.
He wants to go home Without Worries.
Car keys?
- Haven't got them.
Jesus!
Stay here.
- You could also not do it.
Just think for a second.
You're not an ape, are you?
Jesus, Gina... goddammit.
What are you doing here?
I'm going to lift you up.
You can't.
- If we're fast you'll be OK.
Leave me here, Schneider.
Please.
Nearly finished.
It was the centrifugal pump.
They're always a nuisance.
The girls Want to say hello.
Say hello then.
- Hello, Daddy.
Hello.
- We're blowing up the balloons.
Good for you. See you soon.
Bye, dear Daddy.
Will you get here in time?
What time do they come?
- In an hour.
I should manage.
- OK, see you soon.
See you soon.
