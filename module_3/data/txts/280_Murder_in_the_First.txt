You bought 10 smartphones

Yeah.
Um, they were Christmas presents
for Normandy's crew.
I wanted to make a good impression.
Did you give one to Billy?
[Plastic rustling]
He was Normandy's number one.
I wanted to make sure that he liked me.
Well, here's one of the phones
that you bought.
We found it in Billy's possession.
So?
It's his phone.
What does that have to do with me?
Well, it's passcode-protected,
so we can't hack it.
There could be information on it
that could help us break the case.
You know Billy didn't do this
all on his own.
[Birds chirping]
Is there any possible way
you would remember
what the passcode might be?
It was a joke.
I made the passwords the same

Sure.
I mean, Billy might have
changed it since then.
All right, well, you got eight chances

erases itself so...

I get the feeling
God drinks a lot, period.
But you didn't come here
to... wax philosophy with me,
did you?
Is she the only young female
in the morgue right now?
No, it's been a rough week
for the ladies.
Ms. Rivera makes three.
Any O.D.s?

You only met Paul.
You didn't<i> know</i> him.
You're right.
You think you understand, but you can't.
He made me.
I was a part of him.
And now he's dead.
Everyone that I love dies.

<i>That's the phone
that I helped you unlock.</i>
Mm-hmm.
What's on it?
Your father and Billy planning
Normandy's murder together.
I don't believe you.
Listen to it.
Audio can be faked.
Do you want to listen to it?
Sure. Play it.
Paul: [Through cellphone]<i> All
right, you know what we'll do?</i>
<i>5 up front, 15 when it's done.</i>
Billy:<i> Half up front.</i>
<i>Look, this is what I got right now.</i>
<i>When Normandy's out of the way,
I'll be back in Alicia's life,</i>
<i>and I'll have access to more money.</i>
<i>You know that, all right?
And I'll pay the rest then.</i>
<i>I'm not using my own piece.</i>
<i>You don't need to.
I'll get you one, all right?</i>
<i>It's clean. I got all this planned.</i>
<i>May 17th.</i>
<i>Yo, that... that's his</i> birthday.
<i>What do you care?</i>

And then he killed Billy to cover it up.
Blamed the whole thing on Andrew Lippman
so he could keep a sexual
and economic hold on you.
It almost worked.
Did you tell my mother?
Is that why she did it?
No.
She had her own reasons.
He kept her from you.
He made her think that she was crazy
for believing the truth.
I think killing him was the only way
that she could... guarantee
that he wouldn't do any more
damage to either one of you.
[Exhales, sniffles]
I want to go home.
[Sniffles] C-Can I go home now?
Home is a crime scene, Alicia.
[Sighs]
Let me take you back to the retreat.
I'm not going back there.
Rehab doesn't help.
I can handle my shit myself.
Well, this is... this is
a lot of shit, though.
[Scoffs]
That's not your problem, is it?
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

Why are you making me look at this?
Her name's Lizzie.
She O.D.'d, like you.
Only with less luck.
How old is she?
17.
What did she take?
What difference does it make?
She's dead.
If you want to stay alive,
you need to change,
or else that's you lying in there,
under the sheet in the meat locker.
And your mother threw everything away
for nothing at all.

Can I see my mom?
