BETWEEN YOUR LEGS
Dad's here!
Dad!
- How's my favorite girl?
- About to go to bed.
- Did you bring me a present?
- Of course.
It's lovely, Dad!
Look, Luisa! He's going
to sleep with me!
Your bed's like a zoo
as it is.
- We were expecting you tomorrow.
- The meeting was cancelled.
- Did my wife call?
- Yes.
She'll be back late.
C'mon, missy.
- Bedtime.
- Give me a kiss.
See you tomorrow, Dad!
I'm sorry, I'll gather up
my things now.
There's no rush.
Have you eaten?
I hate airplane food.
I'm going to fix something.
I could make enough for two.
If you don't mind.
I took a bath
with the child.
That's all right.
I hadn't planned
on sleeping over.
This must be yours.
Thanks.
How do you like your meat?
Well done or rare?
Very rare.
Don't hurt her!
Don't hurt her!
Stop it! Stop!
At times, life offers
very cruel solutions...
...to make one aware...
...of one's reality.
They gave me 14 stitches
and I left home forever.
wife called all my patients
one by one...
...and managed to get more
than half to stop visiting me.
The child hasn't spoken to me
since then.
It's difficult to find
one person in this world...
...who doesn't have
sexual problems.
But most people don't suffer
pain or anxiety because of them.
Nor are they troubled
24 hours a day like we are.
If we're here, it's because we've
tried to change our behavior...
...and couldn't.
And after many doubts
and endless attempts,...
...we're scared by the amount of
energy we devote to our addiction.
By how we steal time
from work,...
...from our family,...
...from our social life.
The Association of Sex Addicts
Anonymous...
...doesn't guarantee results.
I'm saying that because I don't
want anyone expecting miracles.
We aren't a religious
association.
We don't accept money.
We aren't connected to any sect
or any scientific, medical...
...or cultural institution.
We are just a group...
...of citizens gathered
together for one end.
To regain control
of our sexuality.
That's why it's important that
each of us accepts he's ill...
...and needs help.
They are, of course, absolutely
confidential, so don't worry.
And the advantage
we sex addicts have...
...is you can't see it
in our faces.
I must warn you that we don't
admit thrill seekers...
...or exhibitionists.
All we're interested in is
getting back to our old selves.
Nothing else.
Well, take all the time you need
to fill in the forms.
I'm sorry, I have to leave.
Do you think "true love" will
help you to be free of "lust",...
...give up masturbation
or stop being so promiscuous?
Do you have a destructive...
...or sexual need...
This hasn't happened
since I was a kid.
Lately, my socks keep
falling down.
Do you turn to sex...
A. To escape from reality.
B. To ease your anxiety.
C. Or simply because
you can't help it.
"To escape from reality.
Because you can't help it. "
It all began eight months ago,
on July 14.
Look, I'm in a hurry.
The plane leaves at 12.30.
Don't worry, you won't miss it.
The airport will respect
the 10 minutes silence too.
Can't you see everyone's
future is at stake?
Don't think I'm not
very sorry for that boy.
In America, they sort this
out in no time.
The gas chamber
or an injection.
After 48 hours
of unbearable anguish,...
...ETA has assassinated
a29 year old man.
He was the latest victim
of terrorism.
And at present, the whole
country is preparing...
...to keep ten minutes
of silence in his memory,...
...determined not to tolerate
that things continue like this.
There is a unanimous cry
in all our minds.
Stop!
Madrid has come
to a standstill.
Big cities like Barcelona,
Valencia, Bilbao and Seville...
...are sharing
in this family's sorrow...
...and asking why.
You go crazy
stuck in here all day.
I work sixteen hours a day.
So if a woman gives you
the come-on, what do you do?
Did you ask to be born with
a dick between your legs?
Neither did I.
I'm not going to mouth off
that I dip it every week,...
...but one day a pretty girl
stops you, she gets in.
She's wearing a perfume
that drives you crazy.
A few glances in the mirror.
You turn off the radio, she starts
talking, she rubs her stockings.
No condom,
and you're fucked for good.
I didn't give it to my wife,...
...but it was a miracle.
Can you imagine,
with two kids?
K]now what I mean?
My Juani...
...threw me out
and she was right.
But I love her.
That's why I pray a lot.
CHARACTER:
TAXI DRIVER...
I want God to know I'm a good
man who had a weak moment.
Look, you'll make it.
Your flight left 5 minutes ago.
I could get you on a flight
for Prague in two hours time.
You could rent a car there
and drive to Munich.
If that's all there is,...
...yes.
I hate these things.
Great timing.
The battery's dead.
Use this.
I've never missed a plane
before. Have you?
My husband's picking me up.
We can give you a lift.
Thanks, but I think I'll
take a walk around Prague.
You say Prague
and your eyes light up.
Yes, it's a city I love,...
...especially at night.
There's a little hotel,
near the bridge.
The Three Ostriches.
I'm going there.
It's awful about that boy,
isn't it?
What boy?
The one they killed.
I know nothing about it.
I don't watch television
or read the newspapers.
Everything horrifies me.
I'm odd, I know.
My name's Javier.
The name on my I.D. is Azucena.
But it might be Almudena.
It's a complicated story.
Want to hear it?
Yes.
I was born one of triplets,...
...but after two days, I was
different from the others.
We were like day and night.
If they were like dolls,
I was like a chimpanzee.
We grew, and so did
the difference.
I was much taller
and my feet were enormous.
We were only ten
when my mother, a translator,...
...fell in love with
a German woman...
...and abandoned us.
Dad, helpless
in that situation,...
...divided us up among the
families of his closest friends.
Margarita went to Cordoba.
Violeta was educated in Madrid.
And I went to the Fabras
in Andorra.
Narcis Fabra's official job
was estate management,...
...but his real source
of income was smuggling.
- And if it were a lie?
- What?
- What I'm telling you.
- I don't understand.
There are women who'd invent
anything to seem interesting.
And men too, I suppose.
I don't know.
I decided long ago
not to waste time...
...finding out about them.
It doesn't matter
if it's a lie. Carry on.
Someone's got a huge erection.
What?
The waiter.
Because of the blonde.
Every time he serves her,...
...she rubs her knee
against him.
I feel ridiculous
telling you my life.
But you can't leave me
hanging on.
When Franco died,...
...the rich people here
wanted to get their money out.
Fabra made a lot,...
...helping them transfer
it to Switzerland,...
...via Andorra.
To prevent the Spanish police
infiltrating from the set-up,...
...he hired a detective.
I was sixteen.
And I fell in love with him.
But at the beginning...
...he avoided me.
He was scared
because I was under age.
I needed some bait to hook him.
I showed him recent photos
of my sisters,...
...and told him my suspicions.
I told him that
I was convinced...
...that I was someone else
and the life...
...that I was living...
...wasn't really mine.
I must go to the bathroom.
To inject myself.
Don't be scared.
I'm a diabetic.
And don't worry.
I don't want you to miss
the end of my story.
What's your mobile number?
909...
...006046.
But your battery's dead.
People used to use
"Have you got a light?"
Now it's "My battery's dead".
The thing is, he was
anxious to fuck me...
...as I was to be fucked,...
...and he started investigating.
He went to Barcelona
and called me to say...
...he had to see me for he'd
made an important discovery.
I used a school trip
as my excuse for going away.
I changed my clothes in the taxi
I took to meet him.
I put on high heels,
a short skirt...
...and stockings.
I wet my panties a few times
out of sheer excitement.
We met in a cemetery.
My skirt slipped between my legs.
It tickled me.
I felt as if I were walking
naked among the dead.
He pointed to a gravestone.
What I saw chilled my blood.
It was a girl identical
to my sisters.
Under the photo, her name:
Almudena.
And her date of birth,
which was also mine.
He said that, on that same day,
triplets...
...and twins were born.
Some nurse got confused...
...and mixed us up.
- Still there?
- Yes.
Wait a minute.
I have to inject myself.
Azucena.
Eccentric.
Diabetic.
- Pricktease...
- That's it.
Something's missing.
I could only tell you that...
...if you shared something
very intimate with me too.
A story about me?
Yes.
Something that you've never
told anyone.
All right.
But by telephone...
I'm not moving from here.
All right.
It might be a good idea if
you went to the bathroom too.
You've never done this before,
have you?
Done what?
Opened Pandora's box.
I'd just arrived in Madrid,
I was 25,...
...and had two scripts which
no producer was interested in.
I had lodgings
I could barely afford.
And from my room...
...I could hear over
a hundred couples...
...fucking next door.
One day the girl from
the next room came in.
A very young hooker
who'd become my friend.
She knew I was broke and
she made a business proposal.
She was expecting
a very kinky client...
...who'd been promised
an orgy,...
...but her partner
had let her down.
Anyway,...
...I just had to strip off,...
...dance with them,...
...and, when I was told to,...
...piss on top of him.
In return, they'd pay
three weeks rent for me.
I followed her advice...
...and drank four pints
of water just to be sure.
We undressed.
The client put his arms
around both of us.
Judith kept dancing...
...and pulled my shorts
down to my knees.
Then she got astride him.
I lay down on the bed
so as not to move too much.
My bladder was about to burst.
"Have you ever been arrested
for a crime involving sex?"
"Once. "
K]eep it.
Thank you.
Never.
You've just taken
a very important step.
It's probably the first time
you've answered something...
...that's been torturing you
for a long time.
But first you have to acknowledge
your problem aloud.
I want you, one by one,
to repeat:
I'm sick.
I'm a sex addict.
I need help.
Any volunteers?
I'm sick, I'm a sex addict
and I need help.
I'm sick, I'm a sex addict
and I need help.
Where can I get information?
- About what?
- The accident.
What accident?
- My fiancee was on that plane!
What plane?
Where are you going?
You and I can't talk.
- Why not?
- Because we're dead.
Our plane crashed.
There were no survivors.
Did you call your wife
to say you missed the plane?
You son of a bitch!
How could you do this to me,
you son of a bitch?
- Selfish bastard!
- Lola...
Please, forgive me.
I knew nothing about it.
I was asleep
until a minute ago.
I swear it.
I'm sick. I'm a sex addict.
I need help.
I need help. I'm sick.
I'm a sex addict.
I'm sick, I'm a sex addict
and I need help.
Well!
Hello
I was here with...
I'm going to the bar.
May I join you?
If you're meeting...
No!
Well, then?
I'll be eating.
We could eat together.
I'm in a hurry. I start work
on the radio in an hour.
Talk show host?
No, I answer the telephone.
The telephone.
One of those programs...
...where people with nothing
to do phone in.
Yeah.
- I don't want to be rude but...
- No, no.
I know what you mean,
but the thing is...
...sooner or later...
...we'll have to get to know
each other, unless...
You've thought too
of not going back tomorrow?
Well, if you want, we can
have dinner together.
On one condition.
We won't talk about sex.
If we order two cheeseburgers,
we get extra french fries.
Have you tasted ostrich meat?
Yes, but it makes me a bit sad.
Why's that?
It reminds me of the ostriches
in Walt Disney's "Fantasia".
I hate that film.
So do I.
When you eat duck,
do you think of Donald Duck?
It's only natural that
we're embarrassed.
When two people meet,...
...after a very long time,
and if he's lucky,...
...one discovers that the other
has an unspeakable secret.
We started at the end.
I do it over the phone.
I do it in the mornings.
I deserve it.
I always talk too much.
When you were in the therapy...
...and you said that about
"I'm sick", did you mean it?
Hello.
Don't you remember me?
No.
The guy with the cocker.
No, I'm sorry.
In Berlin Park.
You must remember.
I don't know what you mean.
I waited for you
the next day,...
...and the next, and the next.
She doesn't know you.
Can you take our order?
We're in a hurry.
Yes.
- What'll you have?
- Well...
The salad with strawberries...
- ... and celery.
- Salad for me too,...
...and some water.
Do you remember this?
You couldn't forget this!
Let go!
Leave me alone!
I've got a really cute dog.
Domingo.
But he's more like an actor
than a dog.
I walk him every morning
at ten o'clock.
You wouldn't believe how many
men walk their dogs at that time.
All different, but all
with one thing in common.
You do that, and they don't
care about the dog, the time,...
...or the place.
There's a Chinese man who sells
sandwiches outside the radio.
Thanks a lot.
You want ham?
- I'll have ham.
What do you do?
- I'm a scriptwriter.
- Are you serious?
- I seriously try.
For the movies?
- Yes.
- I go to lots.
Maybe I've seen one of yours.
- They're very funny.
- Thank you.
But it's odd.
- How do you mean?
- You seem so serious.
We're running late. We're on
the air in two minutes.
Javier, these are my fellow
workers, but they're all crazy.
Hello. I've brought something
to warm you up.
Where did you find him?
Is he free...
...if you send in
50 coffee jar labels?
69.
Hello.
Yes, good evening.
It's the grand fuck
in 90 seconds, guys!
You're disgusting!
Horacio, I've got a good one.
- Can we start with it?
- Maybe.
He's called Agustin, and his
wife's taken up with the father.
Her father?
No, with her father-in-law.
Five seconds,...
...four, three,...
Signature tune.
You aren't asleep.
Maybe you can't.
Maybe you don't want to.
If you won't go out
because it's raining...
...and you don't want
to get your clothes wet,...
...bare yourself in front of
the telephone and call us.
Have you thought...
...what would become
of you and me...
...if words didn't exist?
How long have you known her?
Just a minute.
You won't report it?
Since when has
he made you do it?
Wait a minute.
SEXUAL ABUSE
Hold on, Maribel.
I'll put you through.
No, we don't do horoscopes.
Yes, I'll tell him.
Have you got the results?
LEUK]EMIA
Have you seen...
...another doctor?
Just a moment, please.
You're 16? And when did
you discover...
...you liked men?
Just a minute.
TORMENTED GAY
No, ma'am.
Take my word. Swallowing
semen is dangerous.
Yes, good evening.
From Bilbao?
But...
...your wife?
- Coffee for everyone?
- Liters of it.
It's the only way to put up
with people's hassles.
Can I have your autograph?
It's you, isn't it?
Come on, don't be shy.
I never judge people,
and I never forget a voice.
I hear a voice
and I've got it for good.
You heard me being interviewed
on the radio.
I heard you on the tapes.
What tapes?
I've heard all of them.
Or maybe not. There are so many
and they're so hard to get..
You must be making a load...
...from that nonsense.
K]now how much they asked
for the last one?
A hundred bucks, man.
They get me so fucking horny.
I don't get it.
All right, I get the message.
My motto is
live and let live.
But give me...
...a signature.
MOBILE SEX
Hey, who had the great idea
of the plane that crashed?
Your stories drive me crazy.
So does telling you mine.
But I need to see you,
I'm dying to eat your pussy.
- There was a waiting list.
- What?
There were only two
free seats left. Ours.
Two people took them,
and died instead of us.
They were called Azucena
and Javier, like us.
- We're going to do it now.
- I'm in a meeting.
I can't wait, bastard!
I can wait for an order from
the store, or for my mother.
Get ready, slut.
My wife's left me.
- That's a good start.
- Bitch!
- You're doing better.
- You ruined my life!
The program's ending.
Can I have the tape back?
Where did you get this?
You know The Cock?
Pancho?
No, he isn't here yet.
He usually comes in at 1 o'clock.
Is there any message?
Is anything wrong?
No.
No, there isn't.
You're here, but you're not.
Well...
I'll get that taxi.
Taxi!
Are you free?
- Where are you going?
- To Legazpi.
Get in.
- I'll take you home.
- No, I'd rather...
Really, I will. My car's
in the parking lot.
- Get in.
- Look...
I don't want anything
between us.
Neither do I.
What's it to be, ma'am?
I don't like the taxi driver.
Please, come with me.
Got a cigarette?
Would you mind holding me?
I'm very lonely.
I'm so lonely.
I've never been as lonely
as I am now.
Forgive me.
Don't worry.
First it was my turn.
Now it's yours.
We were behaving like
two psychopaths.
Want to tell me about it?
Do you want to hear it?
Yes.
All of it?
As much as you can tell
from here to my front door.
There must be dozens
of tapes circulating.
Hundreds.
All my fantasies
available for everyone.
And I have a horrible feeling.
Like I'd been raped.
You wouldn't be so together.
You're right.
My problem is I can't stand
reality. I need stories.
- That's why I hooked up with her.
- She must have told you good ones.
And how.
I like your haircut.
- Are you sure it was this floor?
- Yes.
Tell me one.
One what?
A story.
Hers?
No, yours.
I'd better not.
As you wish.
We'd get excited.
We'd what?
We'd get excited, you said?
you been thinking...
- ... that I...
- Me?
All I said...
The last time I got excited
was so long ago I can't remember.
The men I pick up on the street
don't excite me in the least.
You don't have to explain.
- Look, where's your car?
- It must be here. It's a Volvo.
I don't understand brand names!
Tell me if it's black, white,
or whatever!
It's big, family-sized,
and it's green.
I need an analgesic.
I have to go home.
All right.
I'll tell you a story.
Where are you going?
You need the keys to get
into the house!
I'm sorry, but I've got
no idea where the car is.
Speak to me.
- Speak to me.
- You speak to me.
- Are your eyes closed?
- No.
Don't do anything
without a condom.
I can do lots of things
without it!
- You want to go more slower?
- I can't talk, I get distracted.
No, it's much more exciting
to say what you're thinking.
Talk to me.
Talk to me.
The antibiotic!
What?
I have to give it
to my daughter.
What do you mean?
Like it or not,
we're both sick.
I should have taken that taxi.
Felix!
Why aren't you in bed?
It's after four o'clock.
What's wrong?
You fell asleep
with your lenses in.
Fuck!
That's very dangerous.
You can get a detached retina.
I'll give the child
her medicine.
I've got ten days vacation.
I didn't know that.
I'll take the child skiing.
If she gets better, that is.
Her temperature's down.
- Then we'll go on Sunday.
Why didn't you tell me?
- I did.
- Well, I didn't hear you.
It doesn't matter. We never
have the same plans.
- Where's the antibiotic?
- They're really stuck.
- Where's Domingo?
- Sleeping, I suppose.
He always comes to greet me.
He smells me from the door.
Domingo...
Here, boy!
Domingo!
Will you give me some drops?
- What did you do to him?
- What?
- What did you do to Domingo?
- Nothing.
- He's dead, in the kitchen.
- Don't talk shit!
He's still breathing.
Get the vet's card.
It's stuck on the fridge door.
On the fridge door!
Did you hear?
Yes.
- Good evening, Mr. Orilla.
- Hello. Has Pancho arrived?
Yes. He may be in the bathroom.
Thank you.
Javier!
I'm surprised to see you.
The last time, you said
you'd never come back.
- How are you?
- Hello.
Well, the triumphant couple
of the moment!
When's the next big hit?
- We're getting inspired.
If you need another partner,
you know my number.
You're first on the list.
If he could stab us
in the back, he would.
- Are you with anyone?
- No.
Are you?
We have to talk,...
...but not here.
Are you with Lola?
Yes.
Are you really telling me
you're with my wife?
This is a delicate subject.
I don't think this is...
Come here.
How long's it been?
Look, I'll tell her to go home.
Whose home?
- Does that matter?
- Of course it does, Claudio.
Everything matters!
Or maybe not!
A meteorite might kill
us all tomorrow!
I'll get her a taxi and we'll go
to the office. Have you the keys?
You're a fucking creep!
Javier, be careful,
I'll hurt you!
You'll be sorry!
God, how disgusting!
Fucking hell!
Look at my shirt!
My tie, my fucking shoes!
- I have to write this scene!
- Yeah, sure.
Get a pencil and paper.
I'd rather you'd broken
my nose.
It's occupied.
We didn't want to come out.
"I won't go out...
...until I speak with Javier. "
She said that...
...a thousand times.
I wanted to tell you.
I told Lola.
I said I felt lousy
every time I saw you.
For God's sake, our offices
are next to each other.
We didn't want to cheat on you.
We just met...
...in a shop, had a coffee
and started talking about you.
We were very worried about you.
You'll admit that recently
you've been...
...very odd.
Look.
Both from Loewe.
A fortune.
Lend me your shirt.
I'm alone, Claudio.
I live in a hotel
with two suitcases and a computer.
Claudio?
Yes.
Anything wrong?
No, I'll going out now.
I stained my shirt.
How did you do...
It's nothing.
Javier had a stomach problem.
Lola!
Let go of me!
Lola!
I hate scenes, Javier.
Please, leave me alone.
I just need to know why.
Why?
I think you're the one
who has to answer questions.
I heard the tapes.
They're disgusting.
I'm sorry.
I'm even sorrier
that I can't help you...
...because I'm your wife
but I don't know who you are.
Shit! Ernest Hemingway
in person!
- I hear you're looking for me.
- Yes.
You and I have to talk
about some tapes.
Yes?
- Azucena?
- Azucena.
It's for you.
Who is it?
Guess who.
Hello.
Hello.
That's why I never wanted pets.
You suffer too much.
Do you mind?
We're in the bar
across the street.
Give me a kiss.
Get some cigarettes.
All right.
I hope it's not serious.
Good evening.
You have to do me this favor.
I really can't, Jareno.
The boss gave me one day's leave
and I need at least three.
I promised my daughter
I'd take her skiing.
Anyway, I doubt if going
after her will help you.
All that shows
is how weak you are.
Her lover died in the crash
and Carola had a leg amputated.
If I don't go,
I'll lose her forever.
I'll shoot myself.
What if she tells you
to leave?
She needs me now.
She didn't need you when she
went off with someone else.
She's alone!
Did she ask for help?
She can't be on her own. I won't
let her rot in that hospital.
With all the good women
there are around,...
...women who could
make you happy.
I found the woman
who makes me happy.
She's in Melilla,
waiting for me.
- What do I owe?
- For Saturday!
Lottery ticket?
I'll bring you luck.
It ends in 21.
The day we got married.
You see?
- I don't see anything.
- It's a sign.
They send us signs all the time,
but we don't want to see them.
Who sends us signs?
- I'll have one.
- Now I have to buy one.
Two.
I'll do it on one condition.
Take mine too.
From that day, I spent more time
with whores than with my family.
And obviously,
my money was soon gone.
I had to sell the business
for nothing.
A business that had withstood
every crisis.
Sleep well?
I never closed my eyes.
Neither did I.
Did you find the car?
Yes.
My children and grandchildren
are ashamed of me.
I live alone
in a boarding house.
I work at what I can,...
...bits and pieces,
running errands.
And when I get some money,...
...I go back to the club.
They always welcome me
with open arms.
I don't know why,
but I was aroused.
And not because I suddenly
realized I liked men.
What really aroused me was that
it was my girlfriend's brother.
And that we were in his room
and all the family...
...were in the house
and could have caught us.
In fairness, I must say
that he didn't seduce me.
But he didn't refuse either.
But it was I who fucked him.
In eight minutes, my brilliant
future was blown apart.
There was no wedding,
but I'd no regrets.
I wouldd discovered a new pleasure...
...and I became what I jokingly
called a sexual terrorist.
The first time...
...was in the local
butcher shop.
I'd forgotten the minced meat
for the dog.
The butcher was getting
married the next day...
...and he was closing up.
He asked my advice.
He had his suit in the backroom
but he had two different ties.
One very plain,
the other horrible.
I chose the first one.
He asked me to help him
do the knot on the tie.
I saw the danger,
but I wasn't scared.
In fact, I concentrated.
And when I was
on the second knot,...
...he started to fondle...
...my ass under my skirt.
I reacted...
...by pulling harder
than necessary...
...for he had a very
powerful neck.
And also I realized...
...that he liked that pressure.
Everything smelt of meat.
The shop, the suit.
Him.
He fucked me three times,...
...in succession,
and without getting from me...
...a no or a yes,...
...or even a moan.
Nothing he could take with him
to Cancun on his honeymoon.
I've never seen a man
so sad...
...and so repentant.
I liked seeing him like that.
So much so, that I keep looking
for that in every man I meet.
At first, it gave me pleasure.
But not anymore.
Suddenly it didn't.
The problem is I don't know
if I can change.
Every morning I say...
...that I won't go to the park
to walk the dog.
But even as I say it, I'm
fixing the leash to his collar.
I can't help it.
Didn't I give it to you?
No, because if you'd given
it to me...
...I'd have put it in my
glasses case, like always.
- Go on, open the car.
- Why?
Maybe you left
the ticket inside.
Look under the mat.
Remember when you thought
you'd lost your Visa card.
Here it is.
Listen.
What?
Come here.
There's something inside.
- Where?
- In that car!
It's probably a rat,
or a cat.
What if it's a bomb?
Begona, don't go all dramatic.
Get in the car.
I can't hear anything.
Well, we heard something.
Go on, tell him.
Yes, there was something.
How long has that car
been there?
I've been in the firm over
a year and it was always there.
Why not call
the bomb disposal unit?
Look, ma'am. If we call them
and there's nothing,...
...we all look ridiculous.
There may be something there
or not,...
...but no one will make me
feel ridiculous...
...for being a responsible
citizen.
Fuck what they think.
But for 170,000 pesetas
a month...
...I'm not risking my life.
- Where are you going?
- K]eep away!
- It might be dangerous!
- Manuel, where are you going?
Where I fucking want to!
I'm hungry, I want to eat.
I hate car parks!
I swear, tomorrow
I'm selling the car.
Manuel!
There's a man in here.
His head's covered in blood.
He looks dead.
I'm working. What do you want?
They're still bitching
at you.
I said I didn't want
to see you again and...
We're going on a trip, Juani.
- You're crazy.
- No!
We're going to Paris. You, me
and the kids. To Eurodisney.
I've got the money here
for the tickets.
Where did you get this from?
That doesn't matter.
Why doesn't it matter?
I'm going to die.
But my kids will have
a memory of me they won't forget.
Did you steal it?
I can't steal.
Look, I'm very busy...
This is moving fast, Juani.
Fucking fast.
The salon's got more time
than I have.
Have you seen your nails?
A body.
Naked, with its head crushed,
in the boot of an trunk car.
Looks like someone
was settling a score.
Has the body been identified?
Not yet. Go to the morgue
and start the investigation.
Very well.
Who are you taking?
Anastasio and Rojas.
Anastasio?
He drives well.
Felix.
When you hear from that idiot
Jareno, let me know.
I hope he gets sorted out.
Good evening.
Don't be in such a hurry.
To be honest, I feel
a bit embarrassed with you.
- So do I, but I think...
- We can only meet in the group.
It's a pity.
Why is it a pity?
We have everything in our favor
for an honest relationship.
What kind of relationship?
Let's eliminate possibilities.
- We don't want to be lovers.
- No, I've got no lovers.
- Friends?
- With our track record?
That would be hard.
We'll be confidants.
All right.
But we're not a couple
of kindred spirits.
No! That's horrible!
My first impression is that he
was struck with a sharp object.
Both blows seriously
affected...
...the corresponding lobes
and also the cerebellum.
This produced an immediate
loss of balance,...
...muscular coordination,...
...vision and perception.
In a few words,...
...he seemed dead
but he hadn't died.
I'd say the poor man
was alive...
...for ten or twelve hours
in the boot of that car...
...before he died.
Maybe tomorrow...
...we'll hit the jackpot
with the prints.
I vote crime of passion.
He looked more like a dealer.
No one takes...
...such trouble to hide
a dealer's body.
From one day
to the next,...
...for no apparent reason,
we stopped having...
How about one for the road?
A friend of mine's opened
a high-class sauna.
I haven't been yet, but if
you feel like trying it...
Look, it's on that corner.
- Not coming, boss?
- No, I'll go pick up my wife.
You're a good husband.
And she's a good wife.
See you tomorrow.
Rest up.
Have fun.
Well, well.
You're full of surprises.
If he says you've felt nothing
till a man's sucked you off,...
...don't believe him.
I'm worried about Miranda.
She urgently needs someone
to fill her life.
Javier...
I'm going straight home.
My husband's working and I don't
like the child being alone.
You never said what he did.
No, I never did.
- Do you have to go home now?
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.
- It isn't your fault.
Whatever happens to you
from now on is my fault.
Don't be smarmy.
But I am.
At least wait until I turn
my back before you laugh at me.
I won't let you say the first
thing that comes into your head.
What if we're
each other's solution?
You can't forget last night.
Can you?
Want to come to my place
and tell a story?
My girlfriends
and I can't sleep...
...cos no one wants
to tell us a story.
How old are you?
My favorite is Pinnochio.
I like it when his nose grows.
I said how old are you?
I'm eighteen! Eighteen
and two months, I swear!
You're nowhere near it!
- Your I.D.
- It's in my bag.
May I get my bag?
Bastard!
Felix...
Yes?
I've just finished
at the radio station.
What are you going to do?
I won't be off
for a few hours. Why?
We might have a drink
with Blanca and the boys.
No problem.
I'll take Celia
to school tomorow.
All right. Thanks.
- So long.
- Bye.
I always ask my characters
three questions.
Which ones?
What do they want?
What do they need?
What do they get?
And?
What do you want?
Right now?
Yes, at this moment.
The same as you.
Sex?
What do you need?
I don't know. What everyone
needs, I guess.
To be loved.
What do you get?
A sick feeling.
I feel sick.
Can you pull in somewhere?
What do you want?
I've come to take you home.
There's no place for me.
I'll look after you.
You can go back
to where you came from.
I don't care that you went off
with someone else.
Don't touch me!
You don't know what you're
saying. It's the tranquilizers.
The only person I ever loved
was killed in that accident!
My tragedy was
not to die with him.
I don't care if you don't
love me, Carola.
I love you.
I can't stand you.
Go away...
...for once and for all!
After being in bed
with a real man,...
...are you really asking me
to sleep with you again?
Check out this license plate.
Let me know what you find.
- Is that about our corpse?
- No, it's personal.
Boss, we've got new data.
We found remains of sperm
and pubic hair in the car.
Apparently, someone used it
for a private party.
You heard Jareno
gave himself up?
Is that all
you can talk about?
Forensic called.
A second study showed...
...that the body was torn
in the anal area.
So he was a faggot.
According to her,
there's another possibility.
He was a heterosexual
who used a vibrator.
These are the reports of
missing persons in Madrid...
...in the last 48 hours. Only
one coincides with your case.
Jareno went a bit overboard,
didn't he?
Yes, thank you.
You look awful.
At least you look better
after a few hours sleep.
This one...
...is from Central.
Claudia Sanchez, a cleaner,...
...is surprised
her boss isn't at home.
She says he never goes away...
...without leaving
instructions about the cat.
His name is Jacinto Vega,
29, single,...
...profession: dubbing actor.
- Apparently...
- What's a dubbing actor?
I've got bad news for you.
Harrison Ford's voice
isn't Harrison Ford's.
Rojas!
Find the cleaner
and show her the photos.
Yes, sir.
You start asking for a search
warrant. It takes forever.
You'll have to let us take you
to that sauna.
It's fun putting on a condom
in a jacuzzi.
I've got the data on the Volvo.
It belongs to Oriunda P.C.,
a TV and film production company.
It's insured for Javier...
...Orilla Fabregat.
That's the phone number
and address.
By the way, Jareno...
Yes, I know.
He killed his wife.
The latest news
is he's escaped.
His pals will have helped him.
Pigs help each other,
we all know that.
Oriunda, good morning.
...inform of the removal
of a body...
...found in the trunk
of a car,...
...color brown,...
...model Dodge,
license number...
...H5290.
Mom...
need moisturizing cream.
I'm going to Merche's.
Why do you need it?
Shit, are you stupid?
I'm going skiing, remember?
One girl got hepatitis...
...so I'm going instead.
Just as well,
after Dad let me down.
When are you going?
Mom! In two hours.
I told you yesterday.
I'll be back in a minute.
Yes?
Did anything happen to you
last night?
What, to me?
I found blood on your pillow.
And on your shirt.
No, I just had a nose bleed.
Like when I was a kid.
But are you all right?
Not bad.
Miranda...
You never call me at work.
I got a fright.
You got a fright?
That's new.
I found a note in your jacket.
I don't know if it's important.
Did you read it?
No.
Then tear it up.
It has to do with a very
complicated case I'm working on.
What case?
You're never interested
in my cases.
Yes, that's true.
Murder.
We've got a suspect but...
...we can't rush it because
he's a guy with influence.
You might know him.
Who, me?
Yes, he works in film
and you see...
...so many movies.
Rojas is waiting for us
in Hortaleza St.
The cleaner recognized
the photo.
Listen, love,
I have to hang up.
All right.
So long.
Policeman kills his wife
in a hospital in Melilla.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm sorry I called you
at the office but...
You're even prettier by day.
I was anxious to see you too.
Why?
I think I know what I want,
need and hope to get.
I've thought a lot about it,
and the therapy we need is us.
I think I was very lucky
to meet you.
I doubt if I'll find anyone
who knows me like you do.
I want to be with you.
Without a time limit. Starting
right now and far away.
We can go where you want.
All I need is a table...
...and a chair to write.
Domingo!
I've scared you, haven't I?
I'm going too fast.
I know we're not the kind
of people who guarantee...
You asked me
what my husband did.
Yes.
He's a policeman.
He's investigating
a murder case.
You remember the Dodge
in the car park?
The Dodge where we...?
Yes.
They found a body in the trunk.
What?
In the car where we were.
Isn't it horrible?
Yes, it's horrible, but...
Felix says they suspect someone
connected with movies.
There are hundreds of us.
I know.
It's just a coincidence.
I don't know. He told me
in a very strange way.
You say...
in a very strange way You say...
...I know you but I don't.
- Did you tell him about us?
- No.
But is he a jealous man?
Does he trust you?
He's crazy about me.
Crazy.
- He never talks of his work but...
- He's told you this.
Don't you think it odd?
- What if he's followed us?
- Felix?
Since the night of the Dodge.
When I got home he was asleep.
And he was to go on vacation.
But he didn't go.
- What do you mean?
- I don't know. I'm guessing.
Hurt people do silly things.
Even if I wanted to, I can't.
I'd be leaving
too many things behind.
What's behind is behind.
He never spoke of his family,
but you could see...
...that they had money.
For instance, he owned
this apartment.
Did he have visitors?
Very few, and none
while I was here.
Well, there was one time
I caught him with a woman.
I got the impression
she was married.
Why's that?
One morning, I arrived
at nine o'clock as usual.
He'd usually be
at the gym by then,...
...but the lights were on...
.. and I could smell
expensive perfume.
If nothing else,
I've got a good nose.
And also there was a good
leather bag on the sofa.
Did you open it?
He's dead, he'll never know.
A bit. I opened it a bit.
And?
Like I said,
the perfume was French.
What else?
A fine gold wedding ring...
...with diamonds
in the shape of a wave.
And a mobile phone.
Did you see her?
No, he rushed out
in his dressing gown...
...and told me
to come back later.
A neighbor says he often saw
an elegant woman leaving here...
...and he noticed
her perfume too.
She must bathe in it.
Rojas...
We'll need a list of the calls
made from this number.
Very well.
You take a look
around the house.
Have you ever seen this man?
Be careful, Celia.
Put on cream.
Remember the last time.
Mom, I'm not five years old!
Bye.
Celia!
Has she gone?
Yes, she's gone.
What are your plans?
Will we have lunch?
How about sharing a shower?
I've got my period.
That never used to matter.
Why are you barefoot?
Didn't I buy you slippers?
They're in the bathroom.
No, they're in the bedroom.
You have to buy me shorts.
Why don't you try...
...buying me some of those
modern ones?
Calvin whatsit.
Here.
- Your men are on the phone.
- Get them to call back.
You're to call back.
They're asking if they can
go for lunch.
Fuck!
Yes?
- The shower...
- Turn it off.
You're like my kids.
You've got the list of calls?
All right, and whose numbers
are repeated?
Oriunda?
A cinema and TV producer?
Are you sure?
Oriunda, yes.
Claudio Undarroa
and Javier Orilla.
We'll have to pay them a visit
today. Well, after I've eaten.
I want the lab boys
to analyze some pubic hairs.
In case they coincide
with those in the Dodge.
It's nice being at home,
isn't it?
At home we've got
everything we need.
The business is going great.
We can't let our hearts
rule us.
Don't you think it would be
stupid to wreck... Fuck!
How did you get the tapes?
Claudio, you know
you can't fool me.
How did you get them?
If you keep denying it,
you're fucked.
That night in The Cock,
I spoke to Pancho.
He said he just distributed
the tapes.
To get them, he sent the
orders to a post-office.
I discovered that it belongs
to another company you have.
It's a record company.
It's a front.
I've got your catalogue.
You also offer material filmed
illegally with a hidden camera.
What will our actors think
when they discover...
...you've used our shoots
to invade their privacy?
You'll go straight to jail.
Did you set it up?
Tell me the truth.
Did you set it up?
What has that slut got
against you, Javier?
The telephone nut.
That Azucena hates you!
She gave you the tapes?
Last July, a guy called Vega
came to see me.
He had some tapes
a friend had given him.
He said...
...they might interest me.
I recognized your voice
and thought it was a joke.
What did he want?
He said his friend thought
the tapes were works of art.
She wanted listeners,...
...and needed help to get
them into circulation.
I said I couldn't do a lousy
thing like that to a partner.
But he insisted.
He obviously wanted
to hurt you as well.
Why?
I don't know.
What was his name again?
Tell Mr. Orillo that
I really admire him,...
...that I saw his last film
several times,...
...that I hope he likes
my script,...
...and that please,
when he can,...
...would he sign...
...This autograph album.
Your stories are improbable.
Your characters...
...act illogically.
Your style of dialogue
is deadly boring.
Therefore, I would ask you...
...to refrain from punishing
this production company...
...with further literary
output.
Sincerely, Javier Orilla.
The bastard had me by the
balls. He insinuated that...
...if I didn't help,...
...a certain catalogue
of secret videos...
...could fall into
police hands.
What could I do?
K]ill yourself.
Jump out the window and burst
like the sack of shit you are.
Wake up!
How many Valium did you take?
What...?
Yes, how many?
Me?
Why are you here?
I've come to give myself up.
Where would I go?
It's over, I'm not running
anymore.
Jail scares me less
than starting over again.
I've been a policeman
since I was 20.
I can't do anything else.
Where's Miranda?
I saw her get in a taxi.
She had a bag with her,
and the dog.
Here.
Jareno, you know I can't
have you staying here.
What are you looking for?
My gun.
She must have taken it.
Or dumped it somewhere.
Women hate guns, you know that.
Carola...
...used to say...
...that when a man has a gun,...
he ends up using it.
Don't be crazy.
Don't be like me.
Think of your daughter.
I'll call them
to come and get you.
All right?
All right.
Do what you have to do.
Fuck! Jareno!
You think they'll buy it
that a guy goes to Melilla,...
...kills his wife,
comes back...
...to Madrid and kills himself
in your house?
And with your gun?
That's what happened. I don't
care if they swallow it or not.
Where's that fucking coffee?
What did you take?
A cough syrup
that made me sleepy.
This looks very odd, Felix.
Let's see...
.. how we can make
as little fuss as possible.
In the meantime,
you're not to move.
Got that?
Yes, sir.
Felix...
You're not to move from here.
Yes, sir.
Rojas...
I need your help.
I'm forbidden to leave here,
but I've got things to do.
Don't you destroy yourself too.
Just an hour.
I'll be back at seven o'clock.
And if fatso finds out?
You know nothing.
I take full responsibility.
- Hello, Diana.
- Hello.
I didn't know where to go.
Hold all my calls, please.
Very well.
Javier...
I can't go home anymore.
Move into my hotel.
You still want us to go away?
- I think they won't let us.
- Why?
I'm sure Felix senses
about us..
...and he's plotting
to get rid of you.
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.
- Then everything's fine.
- All right.
Yes?
Javier, I'm sorry to interrupt.
There's a police officer here.
- He wants to see you urgently.
- I'll be right out.
- It's Felix!
- You don't know that.
I'm sure of it. Please,
don't let him find me.
Good afternoon.
I'm Javier Orilla.
Inspector Feijo,
from Homicide.
I'd like a word with you
to check out some information.
Is the meeting room free?
I'm sorry, it's being used
right now.
Then we'll go across the street
for a coffee.
No, I'd rather not move
from here.
I gave this number
for a call I'm expecting.
As you wish. But I have
to make a call of my own.
Very well.
Is it him?
Yes.
It's no crime for you
to be here.
I can't.
We'll tell him the truth.
He can't stop us
from going awaytogether.
He'll stop us.
Where does that door lead?
- It's a bathroom.
- Come on, Domingo.
Look, you're not a child.
- And he isn't your father.
- You don't know him.
He's a policeman,
he's on duty all the time.
Domingo!
Quiet!
Please, have a seat.
I'm investigating the presumed
homicide of this person.
His name is Jacinto Vega.
Yes, I remember him.
What was your relationship?
Solely professional, if you
can call it a relationship.
About a year ago, he started
bringing us scripts.
I don't usually remember author's
names but I can't forget his.
Why's that?
He was pestering us
for several months,...
...sending us terrible scripts.
He phoned constantly.
He was such a pest I had
to send him a tough letter...
...so he'd leave us alone.
It's odd, we searched his house
from top to bottom...
...and didn't find one script.
He probably burned them all
after he got my letter.
Could you get me
one of his script?
I'd like to read one.
It might give us a new angle.
If we're not interested,
we return them.
If no one comes for them,
we destroy them.
And you had no further contact
with him?
Not since then, and that
was about a year ago.
So how do you explain
that he kept ringing here...
...until the day he was killed?
I've got no idea.
I see.
May I have some coffee?
Please do.
The body was found in the trunk
of an abandoned car...
...in a parking lot
in Plaza de Espana.
Did you know that?
No.
It seems it was left there
late on Monday night.
We've checked
the security tapes...
...which record the entry
of all vehicles.
And your car appears.
Yes, I parked there
on Monday evening.
It's a bit far from
this office, isn't it?
On Monday, I started therapy
in a center near there.
You parked in the evening,
went to the therapy,...
...and then you took it out.
Not immediately.
Why?
I met a woman.
I spent most of the night
with her.
Just as well for you.
If it were necessary,
but it won't be,...
...you'd have a good alibi
with that woman.
I'd rather not.
Why's that?
She's married.
I don't want to hurt her.
I've fallen in love.
Life's strange.
You think you've seen it all,
and suddenly...
...you find a woman with whom
you feel something new.
Someone who shares your desires,
even the most intimate ones.
I met her at a meeting
of sex addicts.
Ever heard of that?
Is that a bathroom?
Yes.
I'd like to wash my face.
It's not working.
There's another outside.
I'll take you,
and while I'm out...
...I'll speak to my partner
because he's about to leave.
There it is.
Not with 120. After that,
you'll have to let me...
Hang up.
- What's up?
- There's a cop in my office.
Your friend Vega
has been murdered.
He's asking me questions.
Murdered? What is this?
It seems he phoned here a lot.
He thinks it was to me,
but you know it wasn't.
My God!
My God!
Had you anything to do
with his death?
How could you think that?
I haven't told him
about the tapes yet,...
...but if he pushes me...
Don't be scared.
Come with me.
Where?
With me.
I've never hurt you.
I know that,...
...but I'm going with him.
How can you say that?
You don't even know who he is.
Do you know who I am?
That man killed someone.
He didn't do it.
He did!
That's what you'd like,
but it isn't so.
And if I prove it?
When I married you,
you had killed someone too.
Mr. Feijo, two other detectives
are asking for you.
Felix...
The boss found out.
Come with us before things
get more complicated.
If you aren't back in 30 minutes
he'll have you arrested.
I won't let you destroy
your life.
I won't do it.
Javier, you must help me.
Think of my children,
my parents, the scandal.
Get rid of him
and then call your lawyer.
It was you, bastard!
I know and I'll prove it!
You won't get away with it!
Claudio!
Claudio!
Don't be so stupid!
You've behaved very stupidly,
Felix,...
...but now that
it's all resolved...
...you're no longer
under arrest.
The case isn't closed yet.
For me it is. It all fits.
Number One corpse was
blackmailing Number Two corpse.
He threatened to expose
his filthy business.
And Number Two killed him.
Javier Orilla is the killer.
Is this a personal thing?
You followed a trail.
Good intuition, but
you had the wrong man.
Learn to admit your mistakes
if you want my chair some day.
There's still a loose end.
The woman on the phone,
Azucena, Vega's accomplice.
I want to keep digging.
You're taking that vacation
you're due.
Jareno's funeral is
tomorrow afternoon.
No, that isn't right.
No, it's the eyes.
Her eyes were much bigger.
Yes, that's more like it.
Can we try the mouth?
That's it.
Want to tell me about it?
Not tonight.
Was it unpleasant?
You could say that.
Should I phone room service
and order some supper?
I spoke to
my financial adviser.
Once I've sorted out money
matters with Lola and everyone,...
...we'll still have enough
to live off the interest...
...for five years.
And that woman?
What woman?
Azucena. Hasn't she
called you again?
No.
Aren't you afraid
she'll reappear?
I don't think she'd risk it.
Aren't you curious?
Not in the slightest.
It's best if you've decided
not to call her.
Take one of these.
It'll do you good.
Tell me the post-office.
I will, but I want no trouble.
Who is it?
- Guess who?
- Well, the storyteller!
- I want to see you now.
- No.
You and I, never. You know
that's the condition.
You've got a lot to tell me.
Your voice is strange.
- I have to see you now.
- I'm hanging up.
If not, I'm sure the police
will love to hear the tapes.
- The tapes?
- There's a station near here.
You look awful, Javier.
Say what you want. Tell me
whatever stories you like.
I don't care.
I know what you're up to.
You're soaked.
May I take off your raincoat?
You're going to tell me
everything!
You're very tense.
What have you taken?
Look at your eyes.
You're hot.
Someone got you hot...
...and it wasn't me.
Feel better?
Do you want to talk?
I have a headache.
Shall I stay with you?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I listened to those tapes,
you bitch.
Why did you do it?
In the end,
his stories were good.
Which ones?
The ones you never read...
...and give you and hundreds
of others a hard-on.
My friend Vega wrote them all.
I acted them out.
What did you call his scripts?
Improbable.
Illogical.
Deadly boring.
The story of the triplets.
The lovers killed in a plane
crash while they were fucking.
Those were the stories
that hooked you, bastard.
They hooked you because
they're better than yours.
He and I made you tell
the stories you didn't dare to.
I'll give you a massage.
We have to make an effort.
We have to forget
what happened...
...and think that
everything begins today.
Please, don't reject me.
Javier!
It's me, Miranda!
Please, don't reject me.
Please, don't reject me.
Please!
Please!
Hello.
How are you?
Coming back from Eurodisney
with the kids.
Enjoy it?
Fucking great. And you?
Fine.
Can I ask you something
that's been bugging me?
- No.
- Why did you choose me?
How did you know I'd accept?
I risked it.
That's him, isn't it?
No, forget it.
Fancy that, and he looks
so innocent.
He asked me to carry a package.
Just another service.
With all his cases, you
could've got more out of him.
C'mon, love.
I'm afraid your flight
to London...
...is delayed for technical
reasons, but I've got...
...two cancellations on a flight
leaving in 20 minutes.
No one's on the waiting list?
No, so if you want...
- And can we check in the dog?
- Yes.
You're sure you don't want
to ask me any questions?
I already know the answers.
What answers?
I love you, I need you
and I've managed to get you.
But please, hold my hand
very tightly...
...when the plane takes off.
Good morning.
Ticket for the lottery?
No, but...
Check this one.
Just a minute.
Congratulations!
You're a lucky man.
