Fresh meat.
Straight of the farm.
Fresh?
This body is a year old.
It's a sort of a joke,
your predecessor would have got it.
Yes, I understand it was funny.
Lazy, but funny.
You said something
about a farm.
Collective farm number 5.
The big field right next to...
This girl died in the woods?
I'm sorry, you about to say
right next to the woods?
Did you look through them?
No.
Now, better go back
and look through them.
For what?
For something that I can use to identify
her. Glasses, cigarettes, but anything.
If there had been anything,
I would had brought it in.
You think we're all lazy?
- Go back and search the woods.
- It's after five.
I don't care what time it is,
take an extra man, tell Sasha
it's on my authority, comb the area,
look under every leaf and every tree.
All right, all right...
I get the idea.
Heartless son of a bitch,
what is he trying to prove?
Dear Comrade.
He's new.
Doctor Mirtjinskij? Your turn.
The body is ready for an autopsy.
No, there's no question of how the little
girl was killed. Violent blow to the back...
Shouldn't you do an
autopsy all the same?
Comrade...
Do you help me get this job,
so I can do your job too, is that it?
Comrade Burakov...
- What is it? - They are coming in with
something for you, they want you to wait.
Tell them that tomorrow is fine.
I can't deal with it now, it's after nine.
Who cares what time it is!
Have a nice evening.
Violent blow to the back of the skull.
Multiple stab wounds to the face.
On the second body, as many as
17 stab wounds to the face and eyes
along striations
of the eye sockets.
26 wounds to the chest
and a broken sternum.
32 stab wounds with additional
disfigurement to the breasts.
43 stab wounds to the face alone
along with traces of semen.
On the sixth victim's penis has been removed
approximately 2.3 cm. above the junction,
with some additional disfigurement
of the genital area.
Some additional disfigurement...
Some additional disfigurement...
Additional disfigurement of
the nature that suggest...
not so much as a sharp
instrument as teeth.
Yesterday the men of the
Rostov militia
unearthed eight bodies in
different stages of decomposition.
And you brought the odours of
the grave and rumors as evidence.
How clever.
I assume that the time you
devoted to their examination
was the time you couldn't
spare to get cleaned up.
Next time a little less diligence
and a little more hygiene.
In the rather poorly kept
files of my predecessor
I found records of
seven other bodies.
If you do not mind Comrade,
I would like to start
by introducing to the members
of the committee.
General Ivanov,
head of the KGB in Rostov.
Comrade Dunenkov, Comrade Tatevsky,
our Mayor, Comrade Ignatiev...
and of course Comrade Bondarchuk,
Secretary for Ideology of
the Communist Party.
I'm Colonel Fetisov,
I am in charge of the militia,
whose officers efforts
have a small part.
I am also Secretary
of this committee.
Gentlemen,
this is Comrade Burakov.
He is our new forensics expert.
They are a breed of men who work in
basements with chemistry sets.
We could hardly blame
them for looking a little
startled when they come
out into the light.
Comrade please, begin.
It's clear that we have a
serial killer, on our hands.
Already the most prolific
in Russian history.
We will have to take extreme
methods to stop him.
Is he saying a "Serial Killer"?
We understood that there were wide
discrepancies in the wounds inflicted.
That's what he told us, Colonel.
And their were both boys and girls.
It could be two different men.
- It could be a gang. - There are no
serial killers in the Soviet State.
Well that sounds more like
we should think of it then...
It is a decadent
Western phenomenon.
Gentlemen,
that's all we have for now.
Thank you for taking time
out of your busy schedules.
I will keep you informed of any
new developments.
Welcome to the Halls of Power.
- My God, no wonder nothing would stand.
- In this case it will.
- Why?
- Because you will be in charge.
What?
You'll be in charge of the case.
Infact of the entire department...
because technically
we do not have one, yet.
We have a division for the
most serious crimes but...
we put you in charge of the
"Killer Department".
The "Killer Department".
But I am not even a detective,
I'm a forensics man.
Haven't you always wanted
to be a detective?
- Yes.
- Good. Then you're in charge.
Start by making lists of
the man power and
logistical support you think
that you may require.
Then outline a general approach
to begin an investigation.
Report back to me tomorrow.
Good day.
- Is there something else?
- Forgive me, but we reached the top...
of the regional apartment list for
forsenics, my wife and two kids,
we are qualified for
the two bedroom...
We have been waitng
for seven years.
If I take a new job would I
lose my seniority?
I personally guarantee, that you'll
get the next two bedroom apartment
when it becomes
available in Rostov.
All right? Now, go home and tell
your wife about your promotion.
Yes, Sir.
Next, a special report
on crime...
The deadly combination of heroin
addictions and street crimes...
is ravaging American cities
as even their own Time magazine...
- Okay, let's hear it.
- Let's hear what?
If this job is so great,
why are you so upset about it?
I am supposed to
keep it a secret.
I would not tell a soul.
- For God's sake, you're treading dirt
all over the place... - I am sorry.
What the hell have
you been doing?
They made me move some
filthy boxes in the factory.
Good afternoon.
I am from the Police.
You are Mrs...
It's about your daughter...
When did you last see her?
It was well over a year ago.
I don't remember.
She was your daughter, how can you
not remember where you last saw her?
Okay.
Did she have friends?
No. She watched the trains
whole day. She was 'slow'.
Did he have friends?
Who?
What were their names?
- Did he have habits?
- The Electrichka.
- Say it again?
- He rode the Electrichka.
- He rode the trains for fun?
- All the time.
He finds them on Electrichka!
He finds them on Electrichka.
I know it.
Electrichka, the trains that
criss cross rural Russia.
I know what they are, Comrade.
I don't ride them...
but they do sometimes
get in the way of my limousine.
If I was hesitant to my reaction
which had only to do with they...
- big unease.
- About what?
The fact that you was only
been the detective for 48 hours...
and your intution is already
so highly developed.
Are you a genius or just given
to parts of enthusiasm?
I know the killer's method.
He picks up young
people on the trains.
I've been to the station.
They're all there.
The naive, the weak, 'slow'.
- It's over. He has confessed.
- What?
- Who confessed? - Somebody from
the Institution of Shakti. A Gypsy.
He is gonna show them
the murder sights now.
What's your problem?
Don't you remember what you told us?
- They are coaching him.
- They are very experienced detectives.
There it is,
this is were I killed her.
Again you fucked up.
This is how manyth time? Twelve?
He goes for an appointment with the
Spring suppliers on Tuesday.
Come back Thursday, saying...
it went fine and on Monday
I hear that he never saw him.
He never showed up.
Have you any explanation
for your miserable performance?
I am going to take you down and
show you to workers on the line...
see what they think of you.
This is the man who stopped
the chain of supply,
this is the man who
stopped our work today.
You have nowhere to go?
Are you hungry?
I hope this latest
murder puts to rest the idea
that the gypsy boy did it.
Why?
Because he was in custody
when this one was killed.
So what? It could be a
gang of which he was only a part.
We can't discount that man
as a suspect so quickly.
He did confess.
I have some requests to make. We have
16 bodies and no reason to believe...
we found there out there. In my opinion
it's a state of emergency.
And for that reason I have to ask
for more men, a lot more.
I have also need computers,
so that I can start the library
of information about the case.
And I need to communicate with the
FBI Serial Murder Task Force
in Quantico, Virginia.
The largest store house of information
about serial murderers in the world.
And finally we need to publicise
this case, as widely as possible.
First,
to warn people of the danger.
Second, to get more of the
unknown bodies identified.
And third, in the hope of
bringing forth a witness...
to one of the crimes.
- No.
- No to what? No to everything?
Are you mad?
There's a maniac out there who will
kill every child in that god damn district!
Stop this insolence!
- Is there something you
want to say, Colonel. - No, sir.
- You handled that quite deftly.
- Bondarchuk is a stupid man.
He may be stupid,
but he is in charge.
How can it be that you don't seem to know
how things work in the Soviet system?
I know how things work,
but right now there are 16 dead children
and I want a little special treatment.
The strength of the
bureaucracy is measured by
it's ability to resist giving
anyone special treatment.
- I don't appreciate your sense
of humor. - One day you will.
The reason I said no
to your demands...
to ask for more men or
computers, for that matter,
is to admit to our
superiors in Moscow...
that we're overwhelmed.
Which they'll never do...
to ask the FBI for help...
is to admit to the West that
we are behind them in both
forensic technique and
in managing information.
Which they would never do.
And to publicise the case is to
admit that such crimes exist...
in the Soviet Union. Which is one
thing they would rather die than do.
Publicly admit that
anything is wrong.
The only way I have been able to get
anything done is behind closed doors.
- By offering favors, by bribing,
by weedling... - But that will take time.
- It always does.
- Only in this case people will die.
People will die and that'll take all our
strength to suffer these outrageousness,
but suffer them we must.
Because we are the people who have to
catch this monster, Comrade Burakov.
You and I.
And you may have noticed, no one
else is even willing to try.
Good day.
You care about nothing more than
making your superiors happy.
You're right,
I should spend more time...
trying to alienate them.
Perhaps you could teach me.
You say that you and I have
catch this monster...
What you mean it's up to me isn't it?
Thats why I begin as the perfect choice,
if I fail I'll be dangling
out there by myself.
Happy Birthday, Nadia!
Hello.
Are you trying to sabotage
what we are doing here now?
Doesn't you understand that you're
supposed to be under cover.
You're supposed to let
the killer feel comfortable
and let him try to
pick somebody up.
Did you think that wearing your
uniform would help?
- It was freezing when we come
here this morning. - So what?
It is his only warm coat.
My brother-in-law has a warm coat.
I'm sure, I can borrow it tomorrow.
I could borrow it today but...
Give me the coat.
Take it.
I'll give it to you back later.
When we solve the case.
In the years since we discovered the first
bodies, we found six more.
and we interviewed
800 potential witnesses.
For let we have no suspect.
In fact,
all we've been able to do,
is to discredit the theory of the
gang of retards from the Institute
could've been involved.
And according to some of the people in
this room, we haven't been able to do that.
And if you continue to forbid
us to publicise the case
I can't promise to say when
I except our luck to change.
- You're saying that you're no less than
when you have begun. - Not exactly.
Bring in Gorbunov.
Gentlemen, this is Comrade Gorbunov,
Special Prosecutor from Moscow.
- Sit down Comrade.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen, without wishing to
embarass anyone in particular,
I must tell you that I
have been send here...
to take over the investigation, because
of it's poor focus and slip shot execution.
My superiors in Moscow
agree with me,
that we should drop the train stations
survelliance immediately.
Not only because it's costly
in terms of man hours,
but also because it hasn't produced
a single viable suspect in a year.
And because I say this with all
due respect to my predecessor,
It is based exclusively
on one man's intuition.
Well I'm afraid that's not
good enough anymore.
As of now, we'll run this
investigation as professionals.
As of now, standing around
is no longer our style...
aggressive pursuit is.
We'll aggressively
pursue the suspects...
and focus primarly on
known sexual deviance.
For the obvious reason they
fit the nature of the crimes.
And particularly on homosexuals...
going to the fact that there are so
many young boys among the victims.
And we'll concentrate
on a lesser extent
on doctors and surgeons,
because of the precision of the lacerations.
- Is that sounds satisfactory to everyone?
- I object, most of...
Very satisfactory.
Extremely satisfactory.
I particularly liked the idea of
investegating the homosexuals.
I think this is the best
idea we have heard of...
in the pathetic
history of this case.
We want to thank you,
Comrade Gorbunov.
We understand that you'll stay
in the area for another day or so.
I trust you'll have enough
time to get Burakov's team
pointed in the right direction
before you go back to Moscow.
- I am sure I will. - Good then.
We're done here, I think.
Have we not?
Good then.
You've heard him. He would be here
for 24 hours and then he leaves.
We still run the day
to day operation.
In a bureaucracy it
is important to know
which skirmishes to join
and which to ignore.
We are developing quite
a network of informers
among the city's
homosexual community.
For what that's worth?
I found it fascinating that
Secretary Bondarchuk
so vehement about pursuing them.
- Didn't you?
- No.
There is a whole
world full of gossip
and in your hand all that to explore,
Comrade Bukarov.
Perhaps, if you took an interest,
you'll be a little more light of heart.
You think a man is what he says,
don't you Colonel?
He is, if you talks for a living.
A man is what he fights for.
Well, I don't fight for anything.
I know.
He is a doctor without reputation,
if you know what I mean.
It is as I suspected, Comrade,
it's fornication, I made some drawings.
Take them in.
- Seriously?
- Take them in.
Why are we arresting so many
perfectly respectful doctors?
Because we've been told to.
You're told told to investigate them,
not necessarily to detain them.
The doctors who are party members
we detain them as briefly as possible.
The sexual deviances who are party members
we intend to keep a little longer.
Of all the arrogance...
I will speak to the men about it, Comrade.
I will take care of it.
Why don't you investigate the
police men, Comrade Burakov?
Wouldn't you say that
they know more about
getting away with murder
than any other group?
Wouldn't you say that you yourself
will make a good suspect?
- I know it's late, I'm sorry.
- I wasn't asleep.
Bondarchuk suspects the Cop, now.
Someone who knows how to
kill and get away with it.
I suppose it's a possibility.
The one he suspects is me...
- That's absurd.
- I'm afraid, though.
You know what he's like.
Someone could come in the
night and take me away.
If you knew they would
coming on Friday,
what would you do different,
this week at work?
- Nothing.
- Good. Eat.
Pathetic.
Where are you going all dressed up?
It's Saturday.
I have some work.
A trip I have to take for work.
To make up for something I failed to do.
Why does that not surprise me?
I have some vodka in
my bag, would that do?
Use your hands, for God's sake.
Help me in here.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
You're ok?
This almost had pissed him off.
A little respect for the dead!
I want every piece of garbage
within 200-yard of radius checked out.
For fingerprints,
fibers and body fluids.
Every can, every bottle,
you understand me?
If we gonna fail it won't be
because of something left undone.
You understand what I'm saying,
God damn it?!
I'll take 'em up for you,
I'll get them working.
- Ok. Let's move out.
- Is he serious?
- He's going crazy.
- Keep moving.
If you see anything interesting,
you let me know.
- Please stand Citizen...?
- Chikatilo.
May I have your bag?
Citizen Chikatilo,
you're under arrest.
I was on my way home.
I talk to the young people because
I used to be a teacher...
I always talk to young people.
I have rope and a knife in my bag
because I work in a factory.
And often need them.
- What do you think?
- Personally?
I don't think he's a savage.
Well, how do I know?
- I have some more paperwork to do.
Stay after him, okay? - Absolutely.
I have a suspect.
- What is it?
- The blood test came back negative.
What?
Semen sample is type AB.
Chikatilo's is type A.
- I don't believe it.
- It's true.
What you talking about is true?
What does that mean?
Our blood test is for 11 variables.
The FBI is for 149.
- How do you know that?
- I saw it in a movie!
What the hell difference does
it make what the blood test says,
you do not know what
you're talking about.
Comarada Burakov!
Are you aware that your prisoner is
a member of the Communist Party?
Is he not aware that this man is a
Party member in good standing?
Are you or are
you not aware?!
Yes, of course I am aware of it,
I'm a detective Comrade, remember?
You approved my appointment.
- And you're holding him anyway?
- That is my right.
After the blood test
came back negative.
- Who told you that?
- What difference does it make?
- Did you tell him?
- What difference does it make?!
It makes a difference to me...
Let him go.
Now.
Let him go or suffer
the consequences.
Colonel!
Release Citizen Chikatilo.
Burakov Office.
No, not yet.
Strange. They force us not
finding bodies, than finding them.
At least this time,
if we found another body,
we might have another chance
to find fingerprint, or a witness.
In this way, I would rather find
three at a time and none in a year.
Let's get out of here.
Let's go to work.
What happened to the boy?
He is being held in the cell downstairs.
He is not connected to the murders.
But he has given us a fascinating
little pieces of gossip.
- Let him go.
- What?
- Let him go.
- Why?
Why not? He gave you a God damn gossip.
Why can't you just let him go.
I am sorry.
Please, let's show some mercy.
He's a victim, not a criminal.
He's a child.
All right, go ahead.
But don't get anyone else involved.
Thank you.
I'll do it myself.
You can go in.
You'd rather find three
bodies than none...
You'd rather find citizens dead,
if it would make your job easier.
Have you become that perverse?
- I do not think this is a fruitful
line of enquiry. - I do!
Viktor Vasilievitj Burakov...
Do you stand by these remarks?
Do you stand by statement that you
would rather find bodies than not?
Is this man crying?
Is this the man to whom we trust
the safety of our children crying?
Mrs. Burakov?
I am Mikhail Fetisov.
I have your husband here,
he is having a problem.
Yes.
Yes, yes I know.
I have arranged for him to take
a vacation and a 'rest cure'.
Can I persuade you to
come and pick him up?
Replace him.
No.
What is that?
What did you say?
After five straight
years on the same assigment,
Lt. Burakov is taking
his first vacation.
His job will be waiting for
him when he comes back.
Get out.
All of you!
Right now!
- If you ever again contradicts
me in a front... - I have here...
I don't care what
you have there!
- Information...
- Who cares!
From a 19 year old boy whom you
maintain in the town of Sakti!
In the apartment you have arranged for him
and the gifts which you have given him.
And the dates of your last
three over night visits.
If you attempt to fire Lieutenant
Burakov, now or at any time...
I will send all
this to your wife.
- I recommended you for this position.
- I'll always be indebted to you.
Colonel Fetisov stopped
by with a ham.
A whole ham?
Where did he get a ham?
- He's very well connected.
- I bet he knows everyone in pork.
He is very proud of himself
for defending you.
I think, he feels that, he has finally
earned your respect. Has he?
Will you tell him when you go back to work?
I think it would mean a lot to him.
I knew I could
talk you into it.
- Lieutenant Burakov, You're 10 days early.
- I feel much better.
- I am glad. You haven't been home?
- I came here first.
I want to thank you for taking care
of my family while I was away.
And for saving my job.
You were right by knowing which
skirmishes to ignore.
Not really. I have just, when you
spent enough time with the lion,
the idea of roaring starts becoming
more and more reasonable.
- There is something I wanted
to ask you about. - What's it?
While I was away
I spoke to a psychiatrist.
I'd like to bring one into the case.
Maybe he have some inside.
You are aware, I am sure that,
never in the history of the
Soviet Union as a Psychiatrist
- been brought into a murder case.
- I know. You will be the first.
You'll make history.
- What? - Did you just come in here and
go out of your way to make me feel good,
then and ask me
for something?
My God, are you are learning
how to manipulate people?
I've created a monster.
- What about the psychiatrist?
- I'll see what I can do. All right?
Thank you.
Now, do you want to go home or
you want to try in these back into it?
Come in!
- Colonel, there is...
- It's all right.
There's another
body in the woods.
- Your timing is impeccable.
- I'm ready.
- What's that about? - He likes to
examine the terrain a little before
- rest of us get in there and stomp
around much. - That's smart.
- It doesn't do too much damage. - So you
would say that he's a good detective?
I'll say that... I never worked
with anyone as good. Excuse me.
Can I tell you about
all the events here?
We start with any physical evidence
on or adjacent to the body...
Make a cast of this?
I'll have it to you by six.
I know it is irregular,
but I hope one or two of you,
would be interested enough in what
we said today to get involved.
If you are, please stay.
Thank you.
It's embarrassing to see grown men
run from their responsibilities.
It's like seeing your parents
drunk for the first time.
They're afraid. To be a
Psychiatrist in this country...
is to be an expert of paranoia,
whether you meant to be or not.
Why aren't you afraid?
I'm sorry. Do I look like
a man of courage to you?
I am Bukhanovsky.
Bukhanovsky.
Well I was always been interested
in abnormal psychology.
Which is a dangerous thing
in the Soviet state.
Anyway, I was fascinated by the pattern
of disfigurement you described.
I'd like to try to help, but discreetly.
I'd like to think about it for a while.
And then write my ideas down,
if I have any, and send them along.
Is that sound all right?
Good.
I would like to be as cautious as
possible not to risk my career.
My God, being a hero
is enormously taxing.
I've only been doing it
only for 7 or 8 minutes,
and already I feel
strangely enervated.
You...
- What is it? - You must live
with a great deal of pressure.
- It's all right, now you know?
- What is?
The suffering of all these,
all these horrors.
If we didn't suffer over them we'd
be monsters among ourselves.
PLEASE READ THIS.
M. FETIZOV.
CITIZEN 'X'
by Bukhanovsky.
I read the whole thing last night.
It is intuitive, well-defended.
- Little chance of that he is homosexual.
- A man with a wife and kids.
- And the sexual problem. - And maybe
a job working with young people...
a worker in a chidrens
home or a teacher.
We will had to have someone go
through the files again.
This is interesting speculation,
but certainly not come close enough
to persuade me to change
the goals of the investigation.
Not the goals, Comrade.
Just a methods.
We'll continue arresting
homosexuals...
it mean that doesn't directly contributing
to the resolution of the case...
but we will still be doing
the society a service.
Under the new policy of Perestroika.
Soviet leaders have agreed yesterday
to surrender the partys
72 year monopoly on power.
The American President
George Bush give with a channel...
to congratulate him of his commitment
to Democratic reform...
and to ensure him that the hopes of the
American people are with us
as we chart the new course
of the Soviet state.
- Thank you.
- Will it change things?
I don't know yet. I've been on
the telephone since midnight.
Just keep the attitude alright,
and we'll see. Can you get him for me?
We've to talk.
No, not now.
Tomorrow, in the office.
- Why? What is it?
- Tomorrow morning.
Don't make me suffer Colonel.
There will be a new head of the
investigation by tomorrow morning.
Come to the committee room at
eight and we'll meet him together.
- Who is it? - It is not decided yet.
I'm flying to Moscow right now
to see if I can influence their decision.
That's why I stopped to tell you.
Don't start worrying yet.
Have I ever let you down?
Thank you so much
for your support.
I'll see you
tomorrow morning.
Good luck!
- Where are they?
- Who?
- The committee.
- We're it.
- Who is the new head
of investigation? - You.
- Congratulations, Colonel.
- Actually, I'm a General now.
I don't have my insignia yet,
but they're on order.
- Congratulations General.
- You're a Colonel.
Congratulations Colonel.
Now, sit down,
let's get started.
I am now the prefect of the militia for the
entire operation. Reporting only to Moscow.
I can allocate my
forces anywhere I see fit,
and I'm considering this case,
my highest priority.
If you need men, you need publicity,
you need communications. You have it.
I get these in Moscow yesterday,
they are fantastic.
You have a telephone appointment,
tonight at midnight.
To speak with the
Head of the FBI's
Serial Murderer Task Force.
Special Agent Beckford.
He told me late last night,
that he has been following
your work on this case
with great interest for about
five years. I didn't ask him how.
He considers you as
a man of iron will.
For what it is worth,
I concur.
He also told me that he rotates his
people of Serial Murderers cases...
every 18 months,
whether they like it or not...
to prevent the inevitable psychological
consequences of too much frustration.
I pretended that I had known that all along.
He thinks that I pushed you...
and pushed you in search of your limits.
Until I realized that you hadn't have any.
Privately, I offer my deepest
apologies to you and your wife.
I hope that someday you can forgive
me my ignorance. Anyway...
he suggested that I not tell you this next
but... He said that he starts a new
group of recruits through the
program every 16 weeks.
And the first lecture that he gives,
is always about you.
He calls you "The one man in the world
he would least like to have after him. "
<i>"An Intelligent, Methodical, Painstaking,
Passionate Detective,</i>
<i>who would rather
die than give up. "</i>
Again, I concur.
Colonel Burakov...
I'm sorry, you may go.
I have a plan.
I've been thinking
about it for a long time.
We intend to have a
visible uniform presence...
24 hours a day...
in every single train station
within 50 miles of Rostov.
Every station, except three.
The three smaller stations of the
Matievs line in the Katma forest.
There we will have only
undercover men.
There we want him
to make his next...
attempt to kill
one of our children.
In order for this plan to work,
we need you to do a job.
We need you to accost anyone who
stops to talk to a child or a young woman.
Anyone who stops to
talk to any stranger at all.
We need to demand their
identity cards,
and ask their business, and take down
their answers in your note books.
We need to search them.
And above all,
we need to do this visibly.
We need everyone in the
station to notice.
Understand?
- What you said, I didn't hear that.
- Yes, Comrade General.
- Again.
- Yes, Comrade General!
Do you think you're capable of performing
these tasks? - Yes, Comrade General!
Do you think that you're capable of
perfoming them without subtlety?
- Yes, Comrade General!
- Without discretion?
Yes, Comrade General!
- Without tact?
- Yes, Comrade General!
Good.
It wasn't long ago,
if a cop took these bigger chance
and failed, he'd have been shot.
For your sake,
I hope it works.
Don't worry, I'll not let them
shoot you. Not before a trial.
It started well.
But, we're only seven weeks in,
and already we're getting lazy.
And reports of one of the stations
reads no suspicious characters in 3 days.
3 days!
- The whole idea is to stay visible.
- Surprise Inspection, you want to come?
All I'm saying is keep
the pressure on, ok?
And, I'll let you know
a little secret.
Surprise inspection in half an hour.
Tell your men.
It does defeat the purpose
of the "surprise".
As for that station. You have to give
them a little sugar once in a while anyway.
Your interrogation slips.
Very good.
Interrogation slips.
Get up here!
Dress yourself.
I had to go to the toilet, I was no
longer than five minutes.
Give me your Interrogation slips.
Why so many?
They are from, since Friday, whole
through the holiday weekend.
How long have
you been here?
36 hours.
- You have no relief?
- No sir, my partner got sick...
and didn't send anyone else from
the station. Because of the holiday.
Let's look through the
Interrogation slips.
No harm done.
You can send these along with
the rest of the interrogation slips.
You're relieved.
What is it?
- Did you personally speak
to this man? - Yes, Sir.
Why?
He came out of the woods and
there was dirt on his jacket.
He was well dressed, but he was dirty.
So, I asked him his business.
He said he visited his mother in Belkov,
which is a tiny hamlet near here.
Which made sense,
except I was born in Belkov and I
didn't remember her. So, I wrote him up.
- Did you search him?
- No, Sir. He hadn't accosted anyone.
- He only just looked odd.
- Do you remember this man? Chikatilo.
- Did he had a bag?
- Yes.
Consider yourselve
relieved of this post.
Take my car to the station immediately.
Tell him to contact Moscow.
I want 200 soldiers here prepare
to search these woods in one hour!
- Got it?! One hour!
- Yes, Sir!
My God...
What is happening to me?
My heart is pounding,
my collar feels tight.
What the hell is this?
Passion.
General,
they found something.
Stand back, Comrades.
You're done your part, thank you.
Get the team together, and start
sending these soldiers home.
Unless the General
have some other use for them.
I have 49 of them
in my conscience.
You mustn't blame yourself.
- It's not that.
- What then?
She is my cousin's daughter,
Natasha Dunyerkova.
She was 8.
I'm sorry.
You'll be okay?
You wanted me to
send someone over you?
For what it's worth, you may
have helped us catch him.
Just keep walking.
How did you do this?
At work.
A box fell over me at work.
Would you mind removing all
your clothes, please. - What?
Remove your clothes.
How did you get these aberations
on the head of your penis?
How did you get these aberations
on the head of your penis?
I don't know.
Can you honestly tell me that you feel
no remorse? Not for killing children?
Not for cutting
off their genitals?
Don't you feel you've to
confess to your crimes?
My God, man,
are you a human!
- This is a disaster.
- Why can't we...
Because we can't... He demanded
to do the interrogation himself.
And he still has
a lot of friends.
- I'll talk about my crimes tomorrow.
- What's then? Repeat that.
I'll tell about my
crimes tomorrow.
- But, I'm exhausted today.
- Did you get that?
Good. Now it's in
the official record.
We're not getting anywhere.
What are you talking about?
Did you hear what he had just said?
He said that yesterday too.
It is the only way he knows to
get you to stop badgering him.
What do you want?
I want you to let us bring in someone
who can get somewhere with him.
- I am doing the interrogation.
- You're wasting time, five days already!
With no other evidence, if we
do not get a confession
by 28th we have
to let him go.
I am doing the interrogation.
Are you willing to take that
risk just to satisfy your ego?
You've handled
him quite deftly.
I'm fed up! I will not suffer
that stupidity anymore.
He may be stupid,
but he's in charge.
What is this?
This is your confession?
In 1978 you fondled the
breast of a 11 year old girl.
You mocking me?
It's true.
I don't give it a
damn if it's true!
We're talking about murder here.
You know that!
You think I'm a fool?
I was fired from my teaching
job for that incident...
I know that!
What the hell a kind of
game are you playing?
Citizen Chikatilo,
I asked you a question!
- Tomorrow is our last day, we would
have to... - You think I don't know that?
If you point the man who
gets him to confess
won't that reflect happily
on your wisdom.
Whom do you have
in mind, Colonel?
I've never done this before.
I'm terrified.
I'm Bukhanovsky.
I'm a Psychiatrist. And I...
I wrote a paper about
you three years ago.
I called you "Citizen X".
I'm sure lot of things
are widely incorrect.
Would you like me
to read it to you?
Pardon me?
Yes... please.
There's some interrogatory rubbish,
designed to make me sound brilliant.
We can ignore that and
we are not should take...
Citizen "X" has probably had a tendency
towards isolation since childhood.
His internal world filled with fantasy
is closed to those around him...
even to those close to him.
The adolescence of such a person is
as a rule painful...
because he is often subjected
to the laughter of his peers...
and at a time when
success among them
is the subject of
his secret dreams.
His sexuality is not noticeable
to those around him.
However it is an
external asexuality
that frequently coincides with steady
masturbation and bright erotic fantasies.
He is painfully sensitive
in company.
Incapable of flirting and courting.
However it cannot be excluded...
that he has fathered a family.
There is a reason to think that the Citizen
"X" has weakness in sexual potency.
This is supported by the fact that
signs of the entry of the sexual organ
into the sexual part of the victims
have been found in nine cases.
But at only two, the length of contact
has been sufficient to reach orgasm.
But with the rest of the cases involving
ejaculation on the body of the victims.
He sits or squats
astride his victim...
the orgasm and ejaculation
most likely...
occur at this stage of the
act and in this position...
sitting on the victim in
the period of her agony.
The blinding of some of the victims could
be a symbol of his power over the partner...
or an inability to bear his or her gaze,
even if it is unconscious.
Or possibly a reflection of
"X" 's belief in the folk tale
that the victims eyes...
retain an image of the killer,
even after death.
It is the last, is it not?
He believed that the police might
see your image in their eyes?
What about the ejaculation,
was I right about that?
Sitting on the victim in
the period of her agony?
You ejaculated while
stabbing them?
I ejaculated while
stabbing them.
Sometimes before they died...
sometimes after.
With or without additional
masturbation?
Most times, yes.
That accounts for the abbrevations on
your organ? The frenzied masturbation.
With the last one especially...
Natasha Dunyenkova.
After killing her
I still had some...
difficulty.
I hurt myself trying
to achieve orgasm.
Congratulations, gentlemen.
He'll said something witty, but he's
overcome with emotion right now.
Thank you both.
May I say that together,
you make a wonderful person.
- Release the monster!
- We will bring him to justice!
Step aside.
Step aside, dammit!
You should thank them for God's sake!
These are the men who caught him!
Step through the door, please.
Please don't turn around...
