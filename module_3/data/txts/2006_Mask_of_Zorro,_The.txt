Come on, Alejandro, it is my turn. Let me see.
Hey, what are you doing
cutting holes in my wagon?
Sorry. We were waiting for Zorro.
- Go home, muchachos.
- Do you think he's going to come?
Someone thinks he will.
Joaquin, Alejandro, once I carved
coffins for your mother and father.
I'd hate to carve ones for you.
Now, go!
Alejandro, Joaquin, this is no place
for you. Now, get back to the mission.
Don Montero,
why are you still here?
Now, now, Don Luiz. Calm, calm.
Santa Anna's men are three miles
from the town. You have to go now.
The government of Spain
would like to thank you.
This land is the property of Spain.
It will be the property of Mexico
unless I hand them over to you.
Santa Anna will respect the claims
of you and the dons.
The rest I have divided equally...
...among the other dons. Make sure
that all of them receive their grants.
Get the children out of the plaza
immediately.
The children should not have to see
the things we do.
I want to see! Put me down.
Zorro?
I saw him.
I saw Zorro. Come on.
- Who are these men?
- Who are they? No idea.
Three peasants pulled at random
from the crowd.
Where is he?
Go.
Come on.
My thanks to you, gentlemen.
Now, if you will excuse me,
I'm missing my own party.
Kill him!
You would murder three innocent men
to capture me?
I would murder 100 innocent men
if it meant killing you.
Three men, three cuts.
A memento of Mexico, Rafael.
To remind you not to return.
Tornado, my old friend,
you are getting too old for this.
Yes, me too.
Is she warm enough?
I always put on an
extra blanket for you, Sefior.
The good prince was not afraid.
He fought off 100 guards.
And then, looking very handsome...
...he leapt onto the balcony.
"Would you kill three innocent men
just to capture me?"
"Yes."
Then lightning flashed
and thunder shocked the land.
The evil king glared
at the good prince and said...
- Something very forgettable.
- What did the good prince do?
Well, he leapt from the balcony
onto his faithful Tornado...
...and raced home to his wife,
Esperanza, and his little child, Elena.
Never to do anything
so foolish or dangerous again.
She loves to hear your stories.
It's only the sound of my voice.
One day she will have no time for them.
I never tire of them.
Why should she?
Esperanza.
She already has your strength.
Today she broke her clay horse.
Diego.
It's just a scratch.
Diego, you promised me.
No more nights waiting up,
praying you come home alive.
The Spaniards are going home.
Today is Zorro's last ride.
From now on we will grow
old together with our five children.
- Five?
- Yeah. Not enough?
I love you.
<i>I</i> Dona de la Vega,
still as beautiful as ever
Don Rafael, what an honour.
The governor in my home.
- Stay for dinner.
- I have come to apologize, Esperanza.
I'm sorry that I could not protect
this country from the peasants.
I'm sorry that I couldn't
make you love me.
And I'm sorry that I have
to leave you without a husband.
Arrest him.
Blood never lies, Zorro.
You are a traitor to your country
and your class. Take him away.
Wait.
- No!
- No!
I would never have let
any harm come to her.
She was never yours to protect.
Elena.
I want you to live with the knowledge
that you have lost everything.
I want you to suffer knowing that
your child should have been mine.
Elena! Elena!
Let me hold her.
Let me hold her!
Rafael!
She has her mother's eyes.
Rafael! You'll never be rid of me!
<i>Stayed on their track
Bringing them back</i>
<i>So pay the bounty now to me
'Cause...</i>
'Cause... <i>?</i>
<i>- Nobody's tough as Jack
- Nobody's tough as Jack</i>
Now you're getting there.
Singing can lighten your terrible load.
Come one, come all,
for the fright of your life.
See the notorious Murrieta brothers.
Robbers, horse thieves...
...bandits, people of the worst sort.
Hey! Get out here.
Garcia.
The Murrieta brothers.
Get over here.
These men are now in the custody
of Corporal Armando Garcia.
- Claim your bounty in Tlaxco.
- When bulls start wearing bloomers.
How much are we worth?
All figured, about 200 pesos.
Two hundred pesos? That's it?
A lousy 200 pesos apiece?
- We are wasting time.
- That's 200 for the both of you.
What? Are you crazy?
Don't take it, Jack.
Touch my brother again,
and I'll kill you.
Yes, he will.
- I thought you were tied up.
- That's because you're stupid.
Drop it.
- They've got a box on the wagon.
- We know. That's why we came.
I, the legendary Three-Fingered
Jack, ain't even mentioned.
Ain't I the one
that figured to kidnap the mayor?
I am the holy guts of this gang.
Without me, it would fall apart.
Go.
Get up.
Go.
Go.
I want you to know
I consider this an honour.
Bury the body. Bag the head.
Of course I have feelings for you.
Yes, yes, but quick.
Hide in the barn.
He's coming.
What do you want?
Please don't touch me. Who are you?
Don Rafael.
Listen to me.
If any of you is, or ever was...
...that masked man
known as Zorro...
...reveal himself now.
I'm Zorro!
- They took my mask--
- Silence, you old fool!
I am Zorro!
I am the man you want.
Liar!
Anyone can see you are too tall.
Get him out of here
before he starts to stink.
Did you find him?
He's dead.
Back to the boat. I need some sleep.
The governor has returned!
- Luiz.
- Rafael, it has been too long.
- Too long.
- You used to favour me above all.
Consider this a fool's apology
for ever doubting you.
Come. A crowd has
gathered to greet you.
- Don Pedro.
- Don Rafael, welcome.
- You're looking well.
- Thank you.
Don Hector.
Don Julio.
Gentlemen.
Please, please.
I know that you are not really happy
to see me...
...so let us all stop pretending.
I know that you have been paid...
...even threatened, to greet me.
I understand exactly how you feel.
Why should you care
about any of your leaders?
What did they ever do for you?
The Spaniards oppressed you,
the Mexicans ignored you.
And the dons?
Well, the dons, the dons.
The dons seem content
to cheat and lie to you.
Who, in your entire history,
has ever helped you?
Zorro!
Zorro fought for the people.
Yes, Zorro.
Where is he now, Padre,
your masked friend?
He hasn't shown himself
in 20 years.
Twenty years!
The time has come to take
our destiny into our own hands.
Not as Spaniards or Mexicans,
but as Californians.
I stand here before you today
with no mask.
Only a solemn pledge
that I will never abandon you.
And you have my word...
...that I will help you fight
for an independent California!
Father.
Gentlemen, allow me
to introduce my daughter, Elena.
Thank you.
- I know the scent of this flower.
- It's called romneya.
But it only grows in California,
and this is your first visit here.
Hey, hey, hey. More whiskey.
- Or whatever you call this.
- Money first.
Money first.
Wait!
- What about this?
- Silver!
Of course, silver. The finest.
- Where did you get that?
- It's none of your business.
Where did you get it?
It was my brother's.
He is dead.
- I'm sorry.
- Why should you be sorry?
Don't trade it
for a mere glass of whiskey.
Why not'?
You think I could get two?
Who is that?
- The man who killed my brother.
- You're in no condition to fight.
Get out of my way, old man.
Would you care to try again?
You're welcome.
- For what?
- For saving your life.
- I would have killed him.
- No, he's trained to kill.
You seem trained to drink.
Yes, you would have fought
very bravely and died quickly.
Who then would
avenge your brother?
- I have never lost a fight.
- Except to a crippled old man.
- What is your name?
- Alejandro.
There is a very old saying:
"When the pupil is ready,
the master will appear."
If you want to kill this man
I can teach you how to take revenge.
And live to celebrate it.
It will take dedication and time.
Why are you so eager to help me?
Because once, a long time ago...
...you did the same for me.
I can't believe it.
I never thought
that I would be standing here.
In the lair of Zorro.
This place was devoted
to the training of Zorro.
Where were you all these years?
I thought you were dead.
I was dead.
And we will leave it at that.
I remember the last time I saw you.
You were fighting 100 men.
You were the greatest swordsman
who ever lived.
Montero was the governor then.
Do you remember him?
Rafael Montero.
Do you remember him?
Yes. His soldiers killed many.
And he was the sworn enemy
of Zorro. You.
- Montero has come back.
- Then you can kill him.
No, there are too many complications
for me to ignore.
What complications?
I can see we are not gonna
spend much time talking.
Montero has some design
for California...
...otherwise he would not have
hired Captain Love.
- We must find out what that is.
- And then what?
If you are ready,
we will both tempt our fates.
Let's go, then.
Do you know how to use that thing?
Yes. The pointy end
goes into the other man.
This is going to take a lot of work.
This is called a training circle.
It will be your world, your life.
Till I tell you otherwise,
there is nothing outside of it.
- Captain Love--
- There is nothing outside of it.
Captain Love does not exist
until I say he exists.
As your skill improves you will
progress to a smaller circle.
Each new circle brings you
closer to retribution.
- I like that part.
- Shall we?
Slow. Attack slow. Attack.
Slow. Again. Slow.
First triangle. Slowly. Good.
- Good. That is good.
- Thank you.
Attack.
Good.
Time for a drink.
Perfect. Do it again.
One, five, three!
Six, four, two!
And lunge.
Lesson number one:
Never attack in anger.
Lesson number two:
Come with me.
What?
- So, what is lesson number three?
- To get to lesson number four.
Again?
- Black Andalusian. Magnificent.
- It looks like your old horse.
Quiet, quiet.
Damned horse.
What are you doing?
I'll see you tonight.
Zorro, you look better than ever.
Be careful, sefiorita,
there are dangerous men about.
Well, if you see any,
be sure to point them out.
Listen. I'm going to give you
the great honour...
...of being my horse.
We are like one spirit.
Stop!
Go, go, go!
Get him!
Kill him.
Zorro! The legend has returned!
- You don't know me, Father.
- Zorro! Of course I know you.
Is it really you?
The years have been kind to you.
I have no time to talk now.
Father, please, hide me.
Come.
It's just like the old days.
Padre, is that you?
Is everything all right?
Don't worry, my dear. You are safe
in the house of the Lord.
Of course, Padre.
It has been three days
since my last confession.
How many sins could you
have committed in three days?
Come back when you have
more time, please.
- Excuse me?
- Listen, sefiorita...
Please, go on.
- I broke the Fourth Commandment.
- You killed somebody?
- That's not the Fourth Commandment.
- Of course not.
In what way did you break
the most sacred of Commandments?
I dishonoured my father.
Maybe your father deserved it.
- What did you say?
- I said, tell me more, my child.
I try to behave
the way my father would like me to.
- But my heart is too wild.
- Too wild?
- Yes.
- Could you be more specific?
I had impure thoughts about a man.
I did. I think he was a bandit
or something. He wore a black mask.
- He had a deep voice?
- Yes.
- Ruggedly handsome?
- His face was half-covered.
But something in his eyes
captured me.
I felt warm and feverish.
Lustful?
Yes, lustful.
Forgive me.
I forgive you.
Look by the altar.
Search everything.
The chapel, the rectory, all of it.
- This is a house of God.
- We'll be gone when he gets back.
Sefiorita,
you have done nothing wrong.
The only sin would be to deny
what your heart truly feels.
Now, go.
Elena.
- What are you doing here?
- I was confessing.
- Confessing?
- Yes.
To whom? The priest is here.
Stand back, Elena. Please.
Out of respect for Miss Montero,
I'll deal with you later.
Horse! Come here.
Blackie! Thunder! Storm!
Stupido! Get over here now!
I warn you. I'll get another horse.
$0?
What do you think?
Sir, I got the black stallion,
I carved a "Z" in the--
The people will be speaking
the name of Zorro again.
You think stealing a horse makes you
worthy enough to wear that mask?
Be careful.
You're a thief, Alejandro.
A pitiful clown.
Zorro was a servant of the people,
not a seeker of fame like you.
A buffoon.
- Zorro did what was needed.
- Now he is needed again.
I didn't ask for your help...
...but I came here
to learn how to fight like you.
To have your strength,
your courage.
Now when I try to use them,
you slap me down?
Let me tell you something.
I am tired of your lecturing.
I am tired of waiting for you
to tell me I am ready.
I have my own scores to settle,
a new life to find.
I thought I could do it here,
but I was wrong.
Alejandro!
<i>En garde!</i>
Choose your weapon.
Montero has invited every don
in California to a banquet.
If you want to be of service,
you can join them as a spy.
I think I do not understand, sir.
You have passion, Alejandro,
and your skill is growing.
But I must give you something
which is beyond your reach.
- What is that?
- Charm.
And what is that?
Convince Montero
that you're a gentleman of stature...
...and he will let you into his circle.
Me?
A gentleman?
This is gonna take a lot of work.
Yes.
Look at me. This is the most
stupid thing I've ever done.
- I doubt that.
- We'll never get away with this.
Yes, we will.
A nobleman just says
one thing and thinks another.
- What if Montero recognizes you?
- Montero is a true nobleman.
He will never look a servant
in the eye. Listen to me.
Listen to me!
Most important thing of all,
do not let the dons leave without you.
- Good luck tonight.
- Thank you.
Stand up straight. Charm.
Charm.
Don Rafael Montero?
Good evening.
Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia.
The formal Spanish greeting.
I have not seen that in years.
- My father was very strict.
- Who is your father?
Don Bartolo del Castillo.
I've heard of Don Bartolo, but I've
never had the pleasure of meeting him.
I arrived last week from Spain by way
of Paris, Lisbon and San Francisco.
I am inspecting
my family's holdings.
Queen Isabella of Spain
has been very generous to us.
Very impressive.
What brings you here?
I heard you were back in California...
...and the queen speaks
very highly of you.
Really?
I thought I fell out of favour with
the court when California was lost.
Only in certain circles.
Her Majesty knows those unfortunate
events were no fault of yours.
She told me this is still a land
of opportunity for a man of vision.
- And you are a man of vision?
- I am a man in search of a vision.
But my timing is unfortunate.
I have interrupted a party.
Perhaps I could call again?
No, no, it would honour me
for you to join us.
No, it would honour me to do so, sir.
Please allow me to introduce
my daughter, Elena.
Charmed.
I'm afraid I have brought no gift
for the hostess...
...but wait a moment.
- Thank you.
- A pleasure.
Bernardo, pick up your feet.
Sefiorita. Caballero.
Don Alejandro.
My father and I would like you
to join us at our table.
I would be delighted, sefiorita.
Don Alejandro, I'm so pleased
you could join us.
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia.
This is Captain Harrison Love.
Not a don, but a kindred spirit.
Are you not the man
who was chasing a legendary bandit?
- He was hardly legendary.
- Was he caught?
- It's only a matter of time.
- The bandit may have escaped...
...but the rest of us will think twice
before going to confession.
Thank you.
Don Hector, I disagree.
Until these people are free...
...I think we will see
many more Z's carved into walls.
Don Alejandro, what do you think?
I think sheep will
always need a shepherd.
But certainly not this Zorro creature.
He probably wears the mask
to hide his bald head.
- Some would call him heroic.
- Heroism, a romantic illusion.
- Much like nobility.
- Elena, that is enough.
Heroism is something to aspire to,
not sneer at.
All that shooting guns,
racing around on horses...
...gives me a frightful headache.
It's hardly the work of a gentleman.
What is?
Climbing in and out of carriages?
No, my dear.
But increasing one's holdings
so as to provide comfort to ladies.
Such as yourself.
A woman's grasp of politics.
What can I say?
We're at a party, aren't we?
May I have the honour of this dance?
I would be glad to.
Yes? Were you looking
for something?
The miraculous in everyday life.
Oh, really? Look someplace else.
We were trying to dance.
You were trying.
She was succeeding.
Forgive me, captain.
A shameless joke at your expense.
I hope it will not be the last.
Don Rafael wants you back. Now.
Should we try something more robust,
or do you feel unequal to the task?
No, on the contrary.
I think only of your distaste
for perspiration.
That is the way they are dancing
in Madrid these days.
Excuse me, Don Rafael,
I need to catch my breath.
Your daughter is a spirited dancer.
"Spirited." Thank you
for putting it so delicately.
- I apologize if you're offended.
- No, no, no.
She is young and impulsive,
but her beauty is beyond compare.
And she has her father's
commanding presence.
Don Rafael.
As an adviser to the queen
in matters of finance...
...it would be my pleasure
to introduce you both at court.
Join us in the courtyard. There is
something I want to share with you.
What is that?
A vision.
Fellow dons of California...
...all of us can recall the years
when we ruled this country.
We commanded respect
and amassed a great deal of wealth.
But we never determined
our own destiny.
The time has come to claim
what always should have been ours.
My friends...
...I give you the independent
Republic of California.
Every man here owes you something.
The land we got made us wealthy.
But we must question your motives.
The day you arrived,
you made us look like fools.
I was merely playing to the crowd.
And what are you doing now?
You want us to raise arms
against Santa Anna.
You know we couldn't defeat him.
I wasn't suggesting a fight.
I was suggesting that we buy it.
Santa Anna is waging an expensive
war with the United States.
Even if we combined our fortunes
we could not buy this country.
- I already have a deal with him.
- You are living in a dream.
And why don't we all live
in the same dream together?
Meet me here tomorrow
for a journey...
...that will lay your doubts to rest.
My friends, I give you El Dorado!
Technically, of course,
all this gold belongs to Santa Anna...
...but, fortunately for us, he's
completely unaware of its existence.
These bars have been marked
with the Spanish seal.
Is it becoming clearer to you?
Two days from now we will buy
this country from Santa Anna.
With gold dug from his own land.
- Where did you find all these people?
- Anywhere we wanted.
Brilliant.
Brilliant.
It's part of the mining process.
First we picked it up, now we blast.
So this is the future of California?
This is my vision, yes.
Up here.
Ain't you a sight for sore eyes!
Full-grown vultures
walking around like real folks.
Welcome.
Welcome to hell's outhouse.
They call us the disappeared ones,
but we ain't exactly disappeared.
- We're just hard to find.
- Wait! You. I know you.
You bet you do, peckerwood.
I'm Three-Fingered Jack.
And you're a bunch of murderers...
...dressed up in fancy,
sweet-smelling doodads.
Ignore him. He's a common thief.
As common as they come.
But nothing compared to you.
I steal gold and money.
But you steal people's lives.
So damn you!
And damn the horse that brung you.
Peckerwood?
Is there something
amusing, captain?
Strange, I'd say.
It's the second time I've shot this man
while he was flying through the air.
Don Alejandro!
I need to speak to you alone.
- Some other time, perhaps.
- Today. Alone.
Good afternoon, Bernardo.
Good afternoon, sefiorita.
- Your voice is so calming.
- He's high-spirited.
Yes, I understand.
How long have you served
Don Alejandro?
Sometimes it seems interminable.
I'm sorry. I speak out of place.
Do not worry, Bernardo.
He will not hear it from me.
Don Alejandro confuses me.
Sometimes he seems
so arrogant, so superior.
And yet the way he looks at me
and the way he dances with me...
As if he were
two completely different men.
Yeah.
You look so much like your mother.
How would you know that?
Well, I don't see
much of Don Rafael in you.
My father wishes
I acted more like her.
- She was proper, always appropriate.
- Is that how he describes her?
- Yes. But sometimes I don't believe it.
- She was more like you.
Perhaps.
It would be a way of knowing her.
My nifiera told me that the departed
can see you in the moonlight.
When I was young I used to sneak out
at night and ride across Andalusia.
I would wave at the skies
so she would know it was me.
- How did she die?
- Giving birth to me.
My father rarely speaks of her.
I think he finds it too painful.
Yes.
I know what it is like
to lose a loved one.
You?
Yeah. A daughter. Long ago.
When I see you, I remember
what it felt like to be a father.
- Your mother would be proud of you.
- Thank you.
I have to ask you,
have we ever met before?
No, why would you think that?
It's strange,
your voice seems so familiar.
I haven't been to Spain
since before you were born.
Of course.
Well, it's a very pleasant voice.
Thank you.
- Good day, Bernardo.
- Good day...
...Elena.
Did you know that
the Compa Indians...
...used to cannibalise
their enemies?
The eyes were most sought after.
To be able to see through the eyes
of an enemy is a valuable thing.
Where are my manners? Would you
care for something to drink?
No?
A different vintage perhaps?
You're a very sick person.
Heads and hands in jars...
...must strike you as odd, I suppose.
You ought to fire your housekeeper.
- Who is he?
- An enemy.
He has a brother
who will share the same fate.
I wish you luck.
- To your health.
- Murrieta's brother or not...
...you are more than
you pretend to be.
Maybe someday I will see
what I look like through your eyes...
...Captain Love.
It is beautiful.
How much does it cost?
It is a gift, she says,
in honour of your mother.
My mother?
- She loved your mother.
- She must be mistaken.
My mother died long ago in Spain.
She says you are the daughter
of Esperanza and Diego de la Vega.
She was your nanny.
She hung flowers on your crib.
I'm sorry, I cannot accept it.
Alejandro.
Listen to me. Can you find
your way back to the mine?
No.
The carriage windows
were all covered.
- He didn't trust his own dons.
- Nor would I.
You must break into the chest
in Montero's study.
- Find out what his plans are.
- People in the mine are dying.
And all I can think of
is Captain Love.
He will come into your circle
soon enough.
- I miss my brother.
- Your brother is dead.
We lose the ones we love.
Put it aside.
How?
How can I do what is needed...
...when all I feel is hate?
You hide it.
With this.
Santa Anna has agreed to
the transfer the day after tomorrow.
He insists we deliver the gold
five miles north of town.
Captain Love?
It's a safe distance from the mine.
I don't foresee a problem.
Tell him we agree.
You have done well, Luiz.
To the independent
Republic of California.
Don Rafael!
You sent men to the hills?
Doubled the guard at the wall?
Yes, yes, of course.
- After all, it's only one man.
- It isn't just one man. It's Zorro
And he knows about the mine.
Otherwise he wouldn't be here.
- How could he possibly--?
- It doesn't matter how.
You don't seem to grasp
the situation.
If Santa Anna finds out about this
he will have us butchered.
Do you understand?
Then we should
destroy the evidence.
Set explosives. Bury the mine.
- And the workers?
- We destroy all the evidence.
No witnesses.
Make sure
those papers are locked up.
Guards!
- The much-debated Zorro.
- No. The legendary Zorro.
Put down your weapons!
Tell them.
Do as he says.
Allow me.
Come. Stop.
Face the window.
Now, bend down
and touch your toes.
Bend over!
Excuse me, Captain Love.
Thank you.
Kill him!
Good morning, senor.
- Good morning, sefiorita.
- Give it back.
- What?
- Whatever it is you have stolen...
...from my father, give it to me.
No.
Come on now.
I don't have the time
to give you the proper instruction.
I have had the proper instruction
since I was 4.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
This will make it more difficult.
Sefiorita...
Don't move.
- Do you surrender?
- Never.
But I may scream.
I understand.
Sometimes I have that effect.
Excuse me.
<i>Goodbye, sefiorita.</i>
What happened?
Zorro. Zorro was here.
I fought him, and he left. He left!
- Did you recognize him?
- No, but he was young and vigorous.
- He was very vigorous, Father.
- Vigorous?
Yes.
Let's go!
Go!
Here. This is the canyon.
That is where the mine is.
They have 25, 30 guards at most.
- Nothing that Zorro can't overcome.
- I'm not going with you.
What?
I'm not going with you.
There's something I must do.
It's a personal matter.
- And the prisoners?
- There's nothing more I can do.
- You mean, nothing you will do.
- I gave my life to them.
My wife was murdered
before my eyes...
...and my child
was raised by my enemy.
Montero?
Elena.
She's your daughter.
She was.
So...
...you will simply take your revenge.
No, my daughter. And don't pretend
she means nothing to you.
She does. But you taught me
to see beyond personal feelings.
- Was that all a lie?
- You're too young to understand.
To understand what? Betrayal?
All the work, all the training,
all the wise words, for what?
To smile in the face of a killer
while you make your own plans?
I taught you everything
you need to survive.
Now I must look to my own heart.
Elena is all I have left.
I am not going to lose her again.
What about California?
What about the people?
They still have Zorro.
Every inch of the countryside
is covered. If he shows himself...
- Are you all right?
- Do you have the map?
- We'll find it.
-ls your army ready to fight?
- No, sir.
- Then I'm not all right.
I'm beginning to wonder if you want
this operation to succeed at all.
- What are you saying?
- What I'm saying, captain...
...is that I think my horse could
run this army better than you.
I Said I'll find him.
That means I will.
Perhaps I can save you the trouble.
Go on, reach for it, captain.
- Who are you?
- I warned you long ago, Rafael.
- You would never be rid of me.
- De la Vega.
- Rafael.
- It wasn't you I saw last night.
- That was Don Alejandro.
- Yes.
But many would
proudly wear the mask.
Either way, events have been set
in motion that you cannot stop.
I'm not here to stop you.
Call for Elena.
Call her.
Captain, bring my daughter to me.
Bring her to me!
You cannot imagine
how I have dreamed of this moment.
Night and day, 20 long years.
Really? I haven't given you
a second thought.
- If I die, the truth dies with me.
- We shall see.
Father!
- Bernardo, what are you doing?
- Tell her, Rafael.
- Tell me what?
- Tell her who her real father is.
What is he saying?
This man lost a daughter once...
...and now he seeks to claim you.
Tell her how her mother died.
Your daughter is lost, de la Vega.
You cannot have mine.
De la Vega?
A woman in town, she told me...
Diego de la Vega?
Father?
His name is of no consequence.
I was told my nifiera used
to hang something on my crib.
Yes, she had her hang
fresh flowers.
No!
No!
Let us finish it, Rafael.
Let us finish what we started...
...the night Esperanza died.
Drop your sword, or I will have
no choice but to have you shot.
Even in the presence
of my daughter.
Please.
They were flowers. Romneya.
Rafael...
...she knows.
Water!
Lock them up!
The fuses are burning. Hurry it up.
Let's go!
Wait here!
Secure the wagon, stay alert.
- De la Vega.
- Rafael.
Only one question.
Really? What is that?
How would you like
your remains displayed?
- Now I'm free to kill you.
- No!
Drop the sword. Drop it.
You really think
I would have killed my own child?
Did you miss me?
Elena! Get them out!
-"M" for Murrieta.
- Two men. One dead.
You're doing well. Your brother
would have shot himself by now.
Alejandro.
Is it finished?
Yes, Don Diego. It's finished.
Not for Zorro.
There will be other days,
other battles to fight.
It is your curse and destiny.
My beautiful Elena.
The world is a strange place.
To have found you at last,
only to lose you again.
You will never lose me...
...Father.
You are like your mother.
Same eyes.
Same mouth.
Same spirit.
Alejandro...
...Elena.
<i>And so it was.
Lightning split the sky.</i>
<i>Thunder shook the air.</i>
<i>And then all was quiet.</i>
The great warrior
known as Zorro was gone.
The people of the land
gave him a hero's funeral.
They came from far and wide
to say farewell to the brave champion.
But, little Joaquin, whenever
great deeds are remembered...
...your grandfather will live on.
For there must always be a Zorro.
And someday, when he is needed,
we will see him again.
On Tornado, riding like the wind.
His sword blazing in the sun.
Leaping, jumping!
Fighting like a lion, like a tiger!
Fighting...
...as safely as possible.
Is this your idea
of putting the baby to sleep?
Sleep tight, my son.
When I sleep, I will dream
of this dashing rogue, Zorro.
But what face shall I give him?
He has been many different men...
...but he has loved you
as all of them.
How can I refuse such a man?
Do you know where
I might find him?
You know Zorro.
He could be anywhere.
There, there, my darling.
