Two minutes. Two minutes.
The electricity goes through debit.
Or is it gas?
- You live here all your life.
I think that the gas is.
- Notice of closure.
This is your third and final notice.
If you do not pay the total amount...
Maybe what I sing.
I'm serious.
Gussie, it's not bad.
Everybody having a good time.
Cantzi, did you like it?
- I cut myself.
He likes. Do you see?
- No, I do not see. It's dark.
Come here. Three friends together.
- Someone has to say it's over.
Sylvio.
- They hate us.
But he loves me.
Whatever you do, Jonah,
embrace him. That is so inappropriate.
Take all a beer.
There is still enough in the vessels.
He does it. He does it.
Is that the cord of my computer?
Thank you very much.
We are very grateful to you.
500.
- What?
Jonah has promised me 500 cash
and a bottle of vodka.
Can you hear me?
$ 500?
- Yes, we do.
There are a million people.
There are only 150
half and did not pay.
Everyone, I want to ask a favor
. The music should again.
If you have money, keep it up.
- You owe me 20 bucks.
Let the party begin again,
Gussie.
Gussie.
Behalf Stevie, Gus and myself
I thank our neighbor Sylvio.
Sylvio.
Okay, we will now continue.
And next week we will do it again.
Yes, we do it again.
Same time, same place.
Party on.
- What?
Photo.
I put on some music.
Come here.
Okay?
- There's something here.
It is pretty hard.
It looks like a lump or something.
It feels a bit like a frozen pea,
just not as cold.
I'm going again.
Only on the left.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
You have testicular cancer.
I know that sounds really...
But testicular cancer is
the least serious form of cancer.
The treatment is very effective.
I expect that you will fully recover.
Do you understand?
It is quite easy to remove the testicle.
The testicle removed?
- Yes.
For Good?
Yes, we have the left testicle
permanently delete.
I can perform the surgery next Wednesday
Then you are further treated
to prevent metastases.
Should I...
Will I lose my hair?
- No, the side effects are not so bad.
Can I still have sex?
- A few weeks back.
But you will again fully functioning
, for one thing.
By treating you become infertile.
Words...
- You can not beget children.
Fortunately, there are great alternatives.
Try the early ejaculation
to catch.
And use soap after the deed.
Some use it as a lubricant.
Do you have questions?
The deposit for the boxes we lost.
I told you they were bad,
but the beer flowed ordinary.
What do the lights still here?
What is it?
Jonah has cancer.
Gus, it's nothing.
- Cancer?
No. It's not a bad cancer.
It's okay.
What kind of cancer?
- Testicular cancer.
Gus, keep on doing.
Actually, it's...
Easy to treat.
They pick the ball out.
A day at the hospital and then
another treatment.
Chemo?
- No, you will not get sick and so.
The doctor will then immediately
people back to work.
What do they do with the ball?
Can you see that if he's out?
I do not know, Gus.
Have you talked to your sister?
- No, but I do.
Maybe I should also tell Ava?
Talking you again?
- Yeah, I mean...
We agreed six months...
- No contact.
But this she would like to know.
Then we better cancel Friday.
Shall we have a group mail?
- No, we say it does not print.
We can not stop now.
We are now net.
It would notice if we cancel.
Hi, Ava. I'm not here right now.
Leave a message after the beep.
From 20:00 to 23:00 we have Dj
Sanz. Azzi and his cousin is drumming.
But if it does, we'll send him away.
I do not think this house
a party can handle.
The house is fine.
- And it is still of Jonah.
This is fixed.
- Can not you pull?
I try.
Hello?
- With Natalie Gibbs of Andrology.
Pardon?
- From the sperm bank.
It was in many respects
strong monster.
The sperm count was optimal.
That's impressive given the situation.
Motility was also good.
Sorry.
Hello?
I'm at the liquor store.
Yes, I watch.
Yes, I will write it down. Okay. Okay.
The problem was freezing.
- Freezing?
We do a thaw test to see whether the
sperm survived.
Sometimes the sperm
reacts badly to the cold preservative.
Then the sperm survives it.
So that from me...
- Your sample belongs to that category.
Is it dead?
- It happens to some people.
Only part? Or...
Can I do it again?
Unfortunately, these results show
that cryopreservation of sperm...
For you is not an effective option.
- What are the other options?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Hey, are you okay? If you do not
want to have, I can bring to your sister.
No, not necessary.
Tell Gus he should come here.
Walk on. Have fun.
Mi-ran-da.
Want a baby with me?
What?
- Want a baby with me?
Mi-ran-da.
I'm not staying. I say a quick hello
against your sister and I'll let you alone.
You know Ava, right?
Is she still with Greggie Chambers?
Why?
Have all your references
and the like included?
You would need to have information.
- I somewhere.
What are you looking at?
- Dirt Girl World.
Mama, Jonah sits on me.
- Would you like something to eat?
What is it?
I have only part of the papers of
Mom oncologist.
Has the doctor asked her file?
Jonah?
I need to call someone.
Thank you for coming.
And sorry that I did not
have to hear from me.
Jonah, the appointment was
six months no contact.
How many times are we now?
- I do not know exactly.
I think that time is now over.
- No, there are now four months have passed.
How's Greggie?
- Prima.
I heard.
How's Becky?
That's nothing. This is only
but occasionally with parties.
This is nothing.
Why did you want me?
I miss you.
Do you remember the time
we thought you were pregnant?
The first or the second time?
Both times.
- Yes.
I've thought about it.
About us.
You and me and a baby.
How would you like that?
What is going on?
Ava, lately...
Are the things in my life
really fallen into place.
Therefore, I think that maybe my
a family thing.
Your thing?
- That is what I must do.
Now. With you.
Okay, why are we really here?
- Because of this.
What?
- Because of this.
What do you think?
You call me after four months...
The problem is...
- That you only think about yourself.
Since your mother's death, everyone
thinks the you all the time...
But you do only what you
yourself want at that moment.
Like I was with someone like a child.
I need more time.
So far you have been very lucky.
There is a small risk of metastasis.
How small?
- And I can operate again until the tenth.
The tenth is fine.
- When cancer is three weeks...
I want the tenth.
We have Friday a broken record.
$ 2000 profit after deducting all costs.
So that's $ 737 per person.
A week salary. Fat, huh?
Bold.
- You get two dollars.
It sucks, huh?
If you want to talk...
You...
Just saying.
Where is the calendar?
That was really that easy.
- An excuse to get me here?
Busted. I make all computers broken,
so to get here.
Gus, I'm working.
- You should talk with Jonah.
He has delayed his treatment
and want a child with Becky stalker.
He's gone mad. He has also been called Ava
. I give him a hand.
Hey man, open the door.
Jonah, open the door.
According to Gus you are way to
stalker Becky to make a baby.
Is that so?
Do you think you feel this way
because it is taken from you?
Yes, it feels true.
Are not you afraid that
this feeling will disappear?
Because that would not be good. Then you
a child stalker Becky.
She's not a stalker.
She's my girlfriend. Maybe
Becky of those few parties?
- And last year.
Then we always sleep together.
I thought that Gus was.
They often slept with Gus,
but I found them enjoyable. I think.
I'm sure. That's what she said.
That I'm better.
Jonah,
I think that you can not do this better.
There are other options.
Adoption or a sperm donor. What?
You do not understand, because
you hate kids. - Not true.
Yes. You call babies aliens.
- I would personally just not an alien.
You do not understand, and the
I do not care what you think.
Okay, fine. I hope you
that the child has only one head.
Because you never know
with all the drugs they use.
Hey, stranger.
Can we talk?
We should quietly do
my roommate is home.
I've been thinking.
Come here. About 45 minutes
I have on my work.
Remember that lump you found?
My uncle had the exact same
to his prostate.
That's not the same.
This is the prostate.
You could have been a wonderful father.
Really?
You have something playful.
And a good aura.
Becky, I'm three weeks fruitful.
I know there's a small chance,
but would you consider...
With me trying to make a baby?
Really?
- Yes.
Jonah.
- My goodness.
Jonah, can we...
I sometimes have a little idea that...
We are not the same for each other.
That's because I was so fucked up.
Yes, Becky. I'm really an asshole
been. Because you see me.
Because you really like.
I think it's fun to play with
to go to bed and so...
But I've never felt like a couple seen.
It's okay. We can equally well be
continue.
Sorry, man. Not right now.
How long were we together?
Three weeks?
It feels much longer. Very intense.
- You just did not show up.
So it will not go
if we have a little child.
I'll buy a calendar.
Jonah, it is not really up to you.
If you are reliable, stable...
Rich, successful and intelligent would be...
Still does not look good.
And Ava?
You were so in love with her.
And Becky Kincaid?
- You're doing really is not?
I have sent you the list of names.
Warn You A to K?
I'll call L to Z.
- Gus, no girl is so crazy...
You have no idea what he is capable of
. You know women.
I'm a woman.
Hey, Jonah. How are you?
Started now.
This week I
all so terribly changed.
If the next nine months as
continues, I completely changed.
I do not even know how I will be,
but I will a damn good father.
Put the tray down but, Mom.
- Thanks, Mrs. B.
I first want to say that
I have several sides.
My party side is most
forward, because you see me.
I know why you're here.
We all know it.
We just want to say...
That we are there for you.
How do you know?
Yes, it is indeed sad,
but we view it positively.
Maybe he tries immediately
to have sex with you.
And if you have sex with him...
Yes, I know. But imagine.
Then I would not have condoms
confidence. Maybe a hole or something.
Thanks.
Who had you on the line?
You would have done exactly the same
. Save me for this.
It goes very well with that party.
We are paid to party.
Life as a Rolling Stone.
They have children.
They all have a piece or
seven children. Look on Wikipedia.
It probably never see them.
Gus, you think you can help me, but let me
the coming weeks alone.
If it changes your life,
I expect a thank you.
Okay, give me a non-alcoholic beer.
- Okay.
I'm not sure which now
alcohol and what not...
Okay, this is what I know about you.
- What you know about me?
You drink vodka.
You share a house with others.
You're against the loan of DVD boxes.
You have a bad relationship behind.
It's been a long time ago.
- Just Good to.
We had a joint
internet company and a mortgage.
I have searched the internet last night
and I can not adopt.
Jonah, this is...
- I've searched adoption sites.
You can not adopt if you have a
medical history. I have cancer.
Anyway...
Do not you go?
- No. No, you know.
He's out there on the sidewalk.
The girls are in their twenties.
There goes wrong.
They do not have any children.
If you really want, you should arrange
something with an older single woman...
Or a lesbian couple.
- What?
What is it? If you really want to.
- That kind of women I do not know.
They are everywhere.
At work there are already four.
I do not want a child of a strange woman
through a scheme.
So much do you therefore also not?
So...
Lesbians who you work with...
- With just one. Allison called them.
Are they nice?
I can not believe you're helping him.
You said yourself that he was in shock.
I know it's a bad idea, but what could I
What?
I did not know if they are vegetarian.
Should I remove the salami?
I am an e-mail to the drawing.
I'm going to say that
the party was canceled temporarily.
If we continue to deal with each other as,
we have no other choice.
Well, send it.
What a fucking mess.
Think before you speak.
Do not go rattle, do not improvise.
- It is good.
First
we wanted to take an anonymous donor.
We have our name even once put on a list.
But we want our child
a father.
Yes, that's right. A diverse family.
I, absolutely.
I'm forefathers.
Jonah, do you and Jennifer Allison
do not ask for things?
So...
Which one of you is ultimately the mother?
We both are. We share the parenting.
I mean biologically.
It does not matter who
the biological mother is
So you do not know who the child will wear?
Well, we were thinking about Jennifer,
because she is younger.
But then occurred to us that
the clock ticking faster for Allison.
I have always dreamed about.
Pregnant, bear a child.
I know. So do I.
And how do you imagine
to be a father?
There are some things that
me well seem to do.
There is a video on YouTube where a
father his son every day shooting.
Only he has the photos from
different distances taken.
But if you have a camera settling on a
certain place, you have that problem.
Jonah, I referred to Jennifer...
- Television.
I meant more
why your father wants to be.
What do you mean?
- Just why.
Well, mostly just
because I really feel...
How it feels.
My whole body
screams just there.
You know what? Tomorrow...
We must be careful.
Tomorrow until I
at my niece and my nephew.
Maybe you can come.
- I'd love to, but we...
If you could see me with kids...
You would understand me.
I have Allison on Monday to face.
Was it that good?
For she saw it sitting.
Maybe she even bi.
- Say just anything.
Give the cheese stem.
- It is on the ground.
Shake the keys.
- Give them.
The house keys.
I do not have keys.
- Are they?
This is Allison.
- Do not answer. I park the car.
Try a small piece.
You hit me. You should never store.
Do they?
I know of no other lesbian couples.
Maybe it's time to let it go.
This would be all.
You would give up your life...
Later for someone you probably will hate.
And then they go.
Then you every two weeks
call if you're lucky.
There is so much more to life.
You really believe that?
The last time I saw my mother...
She said that she was happy, because she
me and Claire got.
She said she eventually
the most important place.
I want that too.
Do you catch him?
Damn.
I hope you do not mind the
that I ask...
But I remember you talking about a
sperm donor was. Or was that a joke?
No, I have information about
searched. So it's not a date?
No, that's just it.
It is a scheme.
Just as a sperm donor, only
get a father for your child.
Yes, that's a bit of a strange thought.
No, I was thinking
what my sister would say.
She has three children.
- Maybe she's just jealous.
I think not.
You do get the best of both sides.
You have a baby, but you can
date whoever you want.
Is a partner for life
really that great?
It is usually dramatic and falls against.
What cynical.
- No, sorry. I just mean...
I think a scheme very sensible.
You get a family,
but keep your freedom.
Should more people should do.
- Sounds like you too.
Do you think he would be a good father?
I do not see that person.
- Usually wears a headband.
A hair band?
- And layering. Many layers.
She looks like someone who
itself makes things.
Did you find her?
Do you want to hire
boxes again for the next two Fridays?
It was not by?
No, I talked to him and he wants
these two parties still do.
He even has a second DJ.
It all gets even better.
It is rather young audience.
- How old do you think I am?
No, that's not what I meant.
You would fit in perfectly.
Really. Look.
- Do you think I can dance?
Have you seen this by
walk from the restaurant?
Stevie.
He was great.
He was really great.
You did not tell me he was so clever.
Maybe because I see him as often.
A little too often.
He lives in the moment, huh?
We have quite a few drinks.
I did not expect that the evening would end.
Have you talked to him?
- No.
He probably still asleep.
I wish I could.
Stevie, I want to thank you
you thinking of me...
And have everything arranged. He is really
fantastic, but I can not.
It would all be done this week
And I do not know him.
- I am guarantor for him.
I know. You've known him for years, but
I know you actually barely.
And that meant no offense.
OVULATION CALCULATOR
Smitty, you overshadow Jonah.
Cantzi, you know me.
You see the benefits naturally.
As attention.
But beware especially good on
all the details behind these parties.
Things like...
Jonah.
Smitty, I give a call
as the shadow period begins.
These things are
the success of the party in the way.
I wanted to just know.
- Very good.
Have you read my text messages?
- No, sorry. Busy day.
What did she say?
- Did they not call you?
She said she had a wonderful evening,
but that she was not wanted.
What? Damn.
Damn.
- But she liked you very much.
Do you think I should call her?
That never happens normally.
I saw him only twice in my life, not stiff
can get.
Tequila. It's that tequila.
In tequila is something that...
- Have you had sex?
No. I tried.
- That was not the intention, Jonah.
It was an arrangement. I have
a hundred times already. An arrangement.
Okay?
- Yes. Yes, though. Sorry.
I had no people of my work must involve at
You were right. Incredibly
I have that happen.
It was an arrangement.
A clear...
Would you a second chance for me to arrange?
I will only have about the scheme.
Jonah, she wants...
- I'll give her this house.
What?
- I'll give her this house.
You give her the house.
- Well if my child is going to wear.
Then share it, you mean?
No, it's for her.
For her and my child.
And can they work?
As much as she wants?
Then you are a family man.
- If she wants to.
That she wants.
- Absolutely. Then I get a manny.
And you would not mind
if she has a relationship
With another man?
- Absolutely not.
Would you find it weird
when they took other men?
How many men are we talking?
- I do not know. Just her friend.
It's her house.
- You can not give her the house.
That's an exaggeration.
- Then I put it on both names.
You do not love me.
What?
What?
I'll just change clothes, would you mind...
There you are.
Tell me how I have to change a barrel.
Jonah, where is Stevie?
She is...
She has migraines.
Serious?
- Yes.
They come later.
And otherwise it does not matter.
We really a team.
We are the best. We're really making.
Okay, guys.
We have to get going.
With Stevie, leave a message.
Stevie? I do not know what
that was just in your room...
But if there is even the slightest chance...
You would consider...
For all the others, I did not know what
I had expected from such arrangements.
But with you though.
Two best friends
raise a child together.
If we possibly do,
I conditions.
Multiple conditions about
which we have to agree.
I agree with everything you...
Strictly confidential?
Possibly it will not work and then I
that everything is back to normal.
And that nobody knows.
- Yes, but then Gus.
No, not just Gus.
Yes, of course not.
No, you should really read.
Really?
Draw the just.
Do not you have any questions or additions?
Are you sure?
Two weeks ago you wanted no children.
And now...
- I know it's ridiculous.
I ask myself falling.
But I'm always the same.
A family man, this house...
I love this house.
You know that.
Freedom, but with a family.
I think it's a good deal.
I do not believe in love,
marry and have children
But this, you and me together
a child with a scheme...
I really a genius idea.
What are you doing?
No, what are you doing?
We do not do it the natural way
. There is artificial.
Artificial?
- Yes.
This is fine.
Have we no longer need?
Reusing we find him?
- Do not worry.
And we do it together with
Monday and Wednesday.
And Thursday. For extra luck.
Produce I
in my room and I bring it to you?
No, I do not like Gus is right.
Then we lock the door.
- There was clear: outdoors.
So we do not do it here?
Was it expensive?
- It was cheap.
Also for four nights?
- It took no real turd.
Where's the dish for?
- I do it.
You can not do directly in the syringe.
So many will not.
And it will be much thicker.
This is to practice.
So you do it in the dish.
Do you do it in the syringe,
or shall I do that?
No, I'll do it.
This is not so difficult.
Did you do that on purpose?
- No, that spray is just worthless.
Do normal.
Shit.
If we now consider emptying and then...
We had four days.
We only missed the first day.
Shit, that's just a quarter of the time.
I'm going to propose something and
I expect you're going to say no...
But I'll ask it anyway.
Do you want to sit down and talk?
What?
- This and that.
Or I can give you a massage.
- I do not like massages.
I'm very good at it.
- I just do not.
What if I go to the bathroom and
get myself ready...
And you prepare yourself here
and when I...
On the verge,
then I come out and...
Can not we just try
normal?
Jesus, what great pillows.
Lie already?
No, not yet. Lie you like?
- Yeah, you know.
Okay, so...
My nose.
Look, I blood?
- No, you do not bleed.
Sorry.
This...
So now then?
Yes, if you...
Are we kiss?
- Maybe better not.
Sorry, no.
- I went too fast?
No, no, that's okay.
It was fine. Sorry.
I only just looked the other way.
Maybe we should step by step?
Maybe slowly from one to ten?
Okay, what is?
And two?
Three.
Seven, eight, nine, ten.
Say something.
Candy for after dinner?
- That I lust, yes.
16.00: ice.
16.30: audio cables.
Yes, you look at the column.
You have to look at the row.
Where you going?
- Things to discuss with DJ Sanz.
I think Gus suspicious.
I was thinking about a projector.
We can film the dance floor...
And outside on the wall projection.
- And things are credited.
And maybe a band.
I have contacts in the music world.
Really?
- What?
In the music world?
- I know the drummer of Fait Accompli.
That band you imagine.
- Google them. They are fat.
If we seedy hiphop band
search, we come to you.
But if we want something fat, then...
- Big Daddy is not sleazy.
Is he not sleazy?
- No.
What do you think, Gus?
It sounds fantastic.
Fantastic.
This projector is great.
What is it?
Are you sure...
This is good for you?
You will now doubt not, huh?
It is perfect for me.
But you still have all the time, Stevie.
You have the chance for years.
Hopefully you do not think that
you later do not get more opportunities.
What that's true.
You get one for sure.
I think it's fine.
The links would still light up
when you move the mouse on it?
Is that so?
- Yes.
Malcolm, do you have a copy for me?
Thank you.
Worry, I have not changed anything.
I only...
- Smitty has run tinker on the site.
Now there are at least 500 people.
And how maybe?
Hello?
- Hey, can you come to me?
What?
- Can you come to my work?
What is it?
I became unwell.
- What?
I became unwell.
But I thought...
Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's too early.
You can not set the clock to
the correct time. It differs.
Yes, I know.
It just felt...
If it were going to happen.
Fortunately we have the
told anyone.
Damn.
Just three days.
Damn.
I wish I had more time or...
Or what?
- I do not know.
Whether you had only one option?
- No. There is not.
I do not stop you.
It's just not feasible.
Do what you gotta do.
I gotta get back to work.
- Are you mad at me?
No, I just need to back to work.
- With you will be fine.
You have plenty of time.
Yes, thank you.
It is so. You wanted half weeks ago
not even a child.
What is it?
I can not believe I hereby
involved'm hit.
This was your idea, Stevie.
- My idea?
I tried my ex-girlfriends.
- Yeah, what was that good.
You do not just angry.
- I'm not. I'm just relieved.
Fortunately, it did not work.
We together with a child was a disaster.
You tell Gus that I
ice to fetch me. I'm going away.
No, about half an hour only.
Where have you been?
There are already 20 people outside.
We walk back and Stevie does not.
She sent a text message.
Only they did not.
What did she say?
Relax. We'll be okay.
Have the drums already connected?
I have two done.
Sorry, half an hour yet.
I had had to cancel.
- No, I do not mind. Really.
We do a step above.
Lollapalooza, right?
I was still a lousy father.
Jonah, I was looking for you al
I got a call committed.
Behalf of you.
Do you have cancer?
Why did not you say?
I still care about you so much.
You can no more children.
- Shall we go upstairs?
Gee, all those things I said.
It does not matter.
It does not matter.
I do not think you would be a bad father.
I think you would be great.
I've always thought.
That's why I always go back. I just saw it.
Playing with your cousin.
And when your nephew was born.
Hey, Jonah. I'm on my way home.
Would you give me a call when you get this?
Thank you, bye.
I have also asked other women.
- Was I the first?
Smitty.
- Do you know those guys?
Have you seen Jonah?
- They wanted the toilet seat unscrew.
Is there something gone inside?
What happened?
I think...
Not think I can.
What?
It's not you.
You're beautiful.
Gus, Gus.
- Now you're suddenly there?
I know half of these people.
Where's Jonah?
- Above. Call Cantzi.
I think I'm in love.
What?
Here speaks the police.
The party is over.
Please, wait here.
Then I solve this.
Who is it?
- Wait here and close the door.
Thank God you did not...
I'm so sorry.
I called you, but you did not answer.
- I've called you too.
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry. I freaked out and
I did not mean... Because...
I...
Sorry.
- Damn.
Excuse me, excuse me. Wait.
Stevie, I did not...
Stevie, please wait.
Okay?
I will reimburse him.
- What makes me thing that's the difference.
A baby does not interest me anymore.
The scheme does not interest me.
I just...
With you.
I am interested in it.
I want a baby with you and I will never get.
You have not eaten anything this morning?
- Since last night, nothing more.
Here some information about the recovery.
Do you have questions?
What do you do with the testicle?
Can we see the end?
I do not need to see.
- Are you sure?
Is it here?
- The door on the right.
I'll stop by after.
And tomorrow I will call you on your
further treatments.
Soon, Jonah.
Gus, will you help me by Aidan
back to the car to wear?
Call me when you can?
Day, Stevie.
He explodes not know, Gus.
- I know, but he always smells like?
I'll be back.
I'm glad you're here.
That means a lot to me.
I've brought you something.
Chocolate Balls. I'm fond of.
- Yeah, I know.
Thank you.
Jonah, what I said that night...
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
- No, I never can say.
Stevie, you were right.
You were absolutely right.
You need to be a mother, Stevie.
This is the best thing here is derived from
. That you know it.
I thought you were a woman would be
on her fortieth thinks:
Damn,
I had a child wanted.
Now you know.
And you've got all the time.
You'll meet a nice guy...
And you have four children together.
I think.
Much am I also not changed.
What about you?
Maybe I've always been destined
to the cool uncle.
This gives your children their first beer.
And one day you will tell them
that if I had not been there...
You would have had no children.
They are coming with the wheelchair,
so it's time.
Stevie, this is good. This is the
beginning of the restoration of Jonah.
See you on the other side.
I'm not dead, though.
- No, that's right.
What you said to me that night,
thought that?
What did he say? What did you say?
Are you ready, Mr. Reid?
The sister will be here.
I meant it.
I believe it still.
You should not settle
with cool uncle.
You need to be a father.
If not through natural means can,
there is always a sperm donor.
What the hell?
