An Innocent Man [1989]
It's cracked,
all right.
In the bellows.
We're gonna have to
replace the whole line.
- You're frowning, Mike.
- I don't know why.
We only have to inspect
the entire aircraft.
What's taking him
so long?
You can't rush him.
He's an artist.
Pneumatics. Not good.
Lots of problems.
The inspector hits on
Wednesday and Thursday.
That plane is
headed for Honolulu--
My people handle anything.
They don't know pressure.
I mean it,Jimmie.
I'm scheduled full...
on that flight.
Tom, it's under control.
- I admire that man.
- He's a great American, Albert.
Let's get the guys
together and talk overtime.
How's this one?
What's the
problem?
I followed the throttle
cable. I can't tell yet.
- Rig pin's in.
- Yeah.
Your V.S.V. cable's
twisted.
I been working on
this for 4 hours.
- How did you figure that out?
- Magic...
and 1 2 years
on the job.
Watch that stand.
''What's the Theory of
Punctuated Equilibrium?''
- [ Kate ] That's the theory--
- ''the controversial theory.''
It's the very
controversial theory...
that evolution--
''That evolution...
is not a series of
steady, gradual changes--''
Right. Right.
But is--
[ Sigh ]
Damn it.
Is punctuated by--
Punctuated by sudden,
drastic ones.
This is not a good day at work
to go over this.
I'll be lucky if I pass
this exam tonight.
Yeah. You don't
stand a chance.
You missed two
out of thirty, so far.
Kate, you're
gonna do fine.
I'll be late. There's salad
in the refrigerator.
That's dinner?
Whatever happened to...
- greasy steaks, white bread
and french fries?
- They are death.
Marriage,
the final frontier.
Good luck.
- You're lucky.
- Why?
I learned how
to ski back east.
The snow is lousy. It's all
slushy, crusty or something.
Out here you
got powder, sun.
I'll tell you
something, Danny.
I thought I'd like it,
but man, I love it!
You go like hell,
and pussy everywhere.
Uh-huh.
There's pussy going up
and down the mountain.
[ Parnell ]
Can you beat that?
You're a
thrill seeker.
I'm known
for that.
Baby, baby.
No matter how many
times we do this...
I still get that good feeling
in the pit of my stomach.
- Let's rock 'n' roll.
- Let's go, baby.
Freeze! Get your
hands up, everybody!
Police.
Don't move!
Get down on your
fucking knees. Get down.!
- Move.!
- Hey, on your knees.
Ahh!
- Put your face on the table.!
- Damn it!
Get down.
Hands up!
- [ Whimpers ]
- Get your hands on your head.
Hands on your head!
Get down.
Get back.
That's right.
Be real quiet.
Mike!
What are you shooting
at a cop for?
You don't shoot
at cops!
Danny, read these assholes
their rights before I kill 'em.
- You got the right to
remain silent, asshole.
- Fucking cops.
[ Siren ]
Is that
our man?
[ Siren ]
[ Scalise ] This guy shot at Mike.
I had to tag him.
It's a flesh wound.
He'll live.
Give him
an aspirin.
-Any of you get hurt?
- Nah, we're fine.
-Anything else to tell me?
- Nah.
It's all yours,
Jim.
Just a few more notches
on your guns, eh?
We've got to
clean up Dodge City.
- It's our sacred mission.
- Yes.
- ""[''When The Night Comes'']
- Kate?
Hi.
Greasy steaks, mashed potatoes,
gravy, fried zucchini.
Everything
you despise?
I zipped through my exam
in 45 minutes.
I decided to treat
my study partner.
You covered all the major
food groups except chocolate.
''Air mail.
Bon voyage.
Have a
wonderful trip.''
Where are
we going?
Did you know
that Bangkok...
has the most spectacular
temples in the world?
Oh!
It's a little doll
from Bangkok.
- From Thailand.
- This one's fabulous.
Look at
this one.
There's hundreds of sacred
monkeys roaming around.
You couldn't find monkeys
in this time zone?
I can get cheap tickets.
I've got passes left.
After we have kids,
we'll be lucky to get to Big Bear.
You'd go anywhere,
wouldn't you?
Kate, the world is not
big enough to hold me.
I am a citizen
of the universe.
Have you got--
Never mind. I got it.
[ Ringing ]
- Yeah?
- Is that you?
It's me.
What do you got?
I had to work
hard for this.
I hope you're
gonna appreciate it.
The deal's
going down tonight.
It's 420 Oak Way.
You got that?
- Yeah. I got it.
- You got the address?
I got the address,
Stevie. Are you deaf?
Hello? Hello?
Thank you!
What a dink.
Stevie just
gave us a nice one;
420 Oak Lane.
I don't know.
Looks awful quiet.
Stevie's always
been reliable.
He knows I'd rip him
a new asshole if he lied.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
You take the back.
I got the front.
Let's go!
[ TV] He was 3 of 4
on 3-point shots.
[ TV- Cheers ]
[ TV]
Ahh!
Police.
Don't move.!
Police.
Freeze!
Police.!
[ Yell ]
He's armed, Danny!
He's down.
He's down, Danny.
I've got him covered.
Go ahead.
Oh, God.
Oh.
Oh. This motherfucker
scared the shit out of me.
- It's a hair dryer.
- What did you say?
This guy's armed
with a hair dryer.
Why would a guy take a
shower during a dope deal?
[ Chuckles ]
[ TV-
Indistinct Voices And Cheers ]
This is 420, right?
Where's his stuff?
Stevie told me
420 Oak Way.
- It's got to be here somewhere!
- Wait.!
Mike, you told me
420 Oak Lane, not Way.
No, no, no, Danny.
I said Oak Way.
- I said--
- Mike, look.
Tell me.
What did I say?
You told me
420 Oak Lane, not Way.
It's right here.
We are at 420 Oak Lane.
Holy shit, Mike!
We got the wrong house.
This guy is a civilian.
-Just a second, now.
- Shit.
- Oh, no.
- Uh-huh.
- Fuck me!
- Take it easy.
- We're gonna think.
- There's nothing to think about.
Too many people want to
see us step on our dicks.
We did step
on our dicks.
Get the bag,
Danny.
We need an ambulance
and a backup.
We have a suspect
with a gunshot wound.
Yes, a gunshot wound.
It's 420 Oak Way.
Lane!
420 Oak Lane.
Right.
Thank you.
You're busted.
[ Gasp ]
- I'm sorry--
- I live here. What's going on?
Who are you?
Where's my husband?
Is he all right?
- I can't--
- Jimmie.!
[ Loud Speaker ]
...Emergency room. Admissions. Stat.
Somebody?
Somebody,
come here, please.!
Somebody!
Come here!
Shut up.
You can't shoot a cop
and not get hurt.
Cop?
They shot me!
I don't know what I'm
gonna do with you guys.
False arrests,
excessive force...
complaints are
very serious accusations.
You already
know that.
Fitzgerald, what
do you want from us?
The man fired on us.
What are we supposed to do?
- He claims you fired.
- That's bullshit.
Then you planted
the gun and drugs.
What else is
he gonna say?
We bring in the bad guys
better than anybody.
We're out there every day.
You know what that's like.
I know what that's like,
Detective.
There's lots that I know.
But there's a difference...
between what I know
and what I can prove.
Isn't there?
- I wouldn't know.
- Well, know this.
I'm a self-righteous man.
It's my Baptist upbringing.
- Oh, come on.
- I was on the streets 1 4 years...
before I made I.A.D.
and I was tough...
fair...
and right.
Jimmie.
- Ow.
- I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Are you all right?
They didn't do
anything to you?
What happened? They said
you had drugs and a gun...
- and you shot at the police.
- How could I shoot anybody?
- They broke in.
- How could they break in and shoot you?
I don't know.
They're lying,
and I gotta find out why.
I've got a lawyer
and he's really good.
- How did you raise the bail money?
- Our savings.
We gotta get this
worked out fast.
It's a mistake.
There's no reason--
How could anybody make
a mistake like that?
How could they just
break in and shoot me?
It's okay.
It's gonna work out.
We'll find the answers.
They've got two
decorated police officers...
sticking to the same story...
- a witness who'll testify
that you sold him drugs.
- A witness?
From where,
The Twilight Zone?
They made a mistake and they're
trying to save themselves.
This old marijuana conviction
doesn't help us.
Mr. Feldman,
I was at a rock concert.
I was 1 8-years old.
Jimmie,
you're going to trial.
The evidence
at the hearing...
was found substantial
enough to warrant that.
The prosecution has
approached me with a deal.
- I think you should consider this.
- A deal?
That means I plead guilty, right?
Why should I?
In exchange for pleading
guilty to possession...
it would be changed
to a misdemeanor.
The assault would be changed
to reckless endangerment.
You'd do 6 months, a year,
at an honor ranch; minimum security.
An honor ranch?
6 months at an honor ranch?
I'm not going to jail
for 6 seconds!
I'm not going
to leave Kate.
Mr. Feldman,
I'd lose my job!
I'm not gonna have my life
turned upside down...
because some police
didn't do their jobs right.
If they found him guilty,
what's the worst they could do?
If the judge ordered the
terms to run consecutively...
he could go to prison
for 1 2 years.
1 2 years?
That's insane.
[ Mr. Feldman ] This isn't a question
of innocence or guilt.
It's about persuasion,
maneuvering...
the appearance of guilt.
It doesn't matter it's false.
Understand?
No, we don't.
What about the truth?
I just won't confess
to something I didn't do.
That's just not right.
You still have
to be proven guilty...
before they throw
you into prison.
Mr. Feldman, you have
to understand something.
Jimmie and I love each other.
We have a life together.
Why would I jeopardize that to
sell dope or shoot policemen?
We were reacting on a tip
from a reliable informant.
Precisely, what
did he tell you?
That Mr. Rainwood kept
a supply at his home.
That he was selling the
product from that location.
- Where did you meet?
- [ Stevie ] By the ferry to Catalina...
by the ticket window.
I bought stuff from him
3 or 4 times.
He always had
good merchandise.
We suspect the drugs were
smuggled to Mr. Rainwood...
- by his contacts at the airport.
- Objection.
Officer Parnell's
suspicions...
- have no place in this case.
- Sustained.
Very well. When you entered
the house, Officer Parnell...
could you tell us
exactly what happened.
We identified ourselves
as police officers.
He pulled a gun from under
his bathrobe and fired.
I reacted.
I dropped to the ground...
and returned his fire
to protect myself.
Isn't it true that you
and Offcer Scalise...
concocted this entire tale
to justify an error?
That you planted both
the drugs and the gun?
No, no. We don't
operate that way.
Quite frankly,
I resent the implication.
Tell me something,
Mr. Feldman.
What the hell is going on
when the police can do...
whatever they feel like
and get away with it?
Where does
that leave us?
With Jimmie.
Well, I'm not giving in
to those bastards.
It's not right.
Give us a minute,
will you?
Sure.
Jimmie,
you're innocent.
You made
the right decision.
Thejury
will see that.
They'll listen.
Kate...
I'm scared.
These detectives have citations
for meritorious service.
They have the highest
arrest and conviction rate.
That doesn't mean
they're telling the truth.
We have the sworn testimony
of a man who says...
you sold him drugs
on several occasions.
We have your
fingerprints on a gun.
We have drugs
in your house.
Most importantly,
we have the word, under oath...
of two distinguished
detectives...
that you fired at them
while doing their duty.
I had a hair dryer
in my hand.
I had just taken a shower.
I don't own a gun.
I don't sell drugs...
and I don't
shoot people.
Enjoying the show?
I thought it was
supposed to be a trial.
I understand you've been
asking a lot of questions.
I have a curious nature, Parnell.
Why would a cop try to break
the backs of other cops...
that are just trying
to do their jobs?
Can you explain?
- There must be some character defect.
- Yeah.
You guys think
I need therapy?
I don't think therapy
would work in this case.
It couldn't hurt.
Sharp blow to the head
is more in line.
James Rainwood,
stand and face the bench.
[Judge ]
James Rainwood...
you have been found guilty
of assault with a deadly weapon...
and possession
of cocaine for sale.
Do you have a statement to make
before I pronounce sentence?
No, Your Honor.
This is your
first offense.
Thejury
recommended leniency.
The prosecutor strongly
reminds the court, however...
that you deliberately
and directly...
endangered the lives
of police offcers.
This act I cannot and
will not treat with leniency.
I hereby sentence you...
to 6 years at the
state correctional facility...
at Oroville, California.
6 years?
Thank you.
Good job.
Jimmie?
Jimmie?
- They can't do this.
- Don't give up.
There's things we can do.
Let's go.
I'm saying good-bye
to my wife!
Come on.
Take it easy, pal.
You know I'm innocent,
you son of a bitch!
You know it.!
Jimmie?
I want to be with him!
Kate,
I love you!
I want to be
with my husband!
You think you're tired now,
wait 'til we start processin'.
Oroville is a nasty shithole, man.
We could've been
goin' to Quentin...
with them old-timers
boring the shit out of you...
goin' on about jazz and how
many motherfuckers they killed.
Soledad's even worse;
all them gang-bangers choosin'
each other off every 5 seconds.
It's a fuckin'
gladiator school.
You can't
get a minute's peace.
My name's Robby. I forgot my
manners when they hooked us up.
I really don't
feel like talking.
This your first bit?
I can tell.
I don't belong in here.
'Course you don't belong.
You think I do?
Nobody ever belongs
in one of these joints.
Gee, it's brutal
being a victim, huh?
- Get your asses off.
I'll kick you in the ass.
- Move it.!
Straight ahead.
What are you looking at?
- Move, move!
- Know where you're at, ladies.
- Move it.
- Get that smile off!.
All right,
let's get naked.
Place your clothes...
and personal effects
in the plastic bag.
Many of you think
you are bad asses.
You are not.
Men get injured
and killed in here...
and it's not just by
other shit-bird convicts.
Cooperate...
you might get out ofhere
without becoming a bitch...
or worse.
You give us
a hard time...
I guarantee you
one long stay in hell!
As soon as
you're naked...
get you hands
over your heads.
Turn around.
Face the guards.
Heads forward...
and run your fingers
vigorously through your hair.
Get vigorous there,
Goldilocks...
or I'm gonna
shave your dome!
Open your mouths.
Run your tongues
back and forth.
Your hands in the air,
show your palms to the officers.
Show them the
back of your hands.
Lift up your dicks
and your nuts.
All right. Give me
my guards out here.
[ Buzzer ]
Step forward to
the next yellow line.
[ Indistinct Voices ]
New fish.
Fish on the line!
Follow the yellow line.
They got some
pretty white boys here.
[ Indistinct ]
Jesus Christ.
Will you relax?
It's only temporary.
We'll be moving as soon as
they finish classification.
'Course the new place
will look like this...
but we'll fix
that place up in no time.
Make it real nice and homey.
Yeah?
[ Cell Doors Closing ]
Lockdown.
[ Guard ]
Lockdown.
[ Guard ]
Stand clear.
[ Door Closes ]
[ Indistinct ]
Look, you gots to learn
so you don't get burned.
Wait.
Notice everything.
Did some dude get a bad
letter from his old lady?
Or get set off in his
parole board hearing?
Or is he in love with some
sissy who's already spoke for?
Moods, you know?
Everything means
something in here.
I'm sure you're the one
to fill me in, right, Robby?
I don't see nobody else
banging your door to show you.
You ready?
This motherfucker's
time has come.
Robby?
Robby, let me see ya.
I got some business
to take care of.
I'll be right back.
- Yeah, as a matter of fact.
- What's he doing?
Same old story.
Nothing changed.
He's still
in that bag.
I'm telling you.
[ Grunts ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Grunts And Yells ]
[ Yells ]
What the fuck's
wrong with you?
Don't hang around unless
you want 3 years in the hole.
- He's burning up for Christ sake!
- So what?
He won't
be the last.
- He said he knew everything.
- Yeah.
He didn't know enough,
did he?
He ripped those
dudes off his last bit.
All right, assholes,
against the wall.
He should've
been watching his back.
Virgil Cane, man. Lone Ranger
ain't got nothing on him.
[ Indistinct Shouts
And Voices ]
- Two cartons on Portland.
- All right. Two cartons, Portland.
- Malcolm.
- Hey.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Hey,Jingles.
[ Felix ]
That's him. Check him out.
What you got
in the bag, sucker?
Hey, Motherfucker,
I'm talking to you.
Some things I got.
Toothpaste, soap,
stuff from the canteen.
You ain't leavin',
punk.
Felix, hold
my shit for me.
You ain't got a problem with that,
do you white boy?
You got what you wanted.
Why don't you get out of my way?
Step back.
Nothing's happening here, right?
That's right.
Never a dull moment,
eh, Virg?
Tension in the big house,
just like in the movies.
I'm glad
I'm leavin' this joint.
This new class of wimps makes
me ashamed to be a convict.
You should be ashamed of being
a lousy judge of character.
Hey, man,
that hurts.
You gonna show like a white man
or what, Rainwood?
Those niggers belong
to the Black Guerrilla Family...
and that's some
nasty old bucks.
Deal with that, or everybody's
gonna know you're a punk.
Everybody.
You understand.
No, I don't.
Am I supposed to fight 3 guys?
No,just one.Jingles.
The one that braced you.
Fist fights
are for free men.
- You gotta get a piece and make a move.
- What?
Doin' him.
You're telling me
I should kill him?
No, I want you to marry
his motherfucking sister!
You better get
with the program, slick.
I'm not gonna kill a man
over toothpaste and soap.
If you don't off that buck,
they'll make you their kid;
running errands,
doin' whatever.
Hell, they might think
you're real pretty.
You ain't got to
stand tall in here...
but you got
to stand up!
I've been thinking about
what to say to you for a week.
Like I told you,
your husband's case is old news.
We thoroughly checked out
the officers' stories.
They held up.
I need some
help here.
I'm tired,
and I'm discouraged...
and my husband's
still in prison.
I'm his only connection to the outside,
and I have nothing.
No one wants the truth
more than I do.
- Those men were lying and you know it!
- Please.
It's not what I think,
or know, or suspect.
It's what
I can prove.
I need something solid.
Otherwise, it's all theory.
I'm not a theory.
I'm a real human being...
and so is Jimmie.
Look me right in the eye,
and burn my face into your brain.
You remember
the pain in it!
We have both suffered
because you people screwed up...
and you didn't
dig up the truth.
We're going to
continue to suffer.
That's real.
[ Machinery Noises ]
Hey.
How'd you get
my pass sent up?
Clerks run the joint.
You do things
for each other.
Somebody's got to give you
the game or you're fucked.
It's simple in here.
It's an insane place
with insane rules...
so it ends up
being logical.
If you're white,
you hang white.
Otherwise,
the niggers eat you alive.
You're not listening.
All that civil rights shit
gets left at the gate.
You've got a problem
with Jingles.
You can go
to the Aryan Brotherhood for help...
that asshole Butcher
and his partners.
They'll make you part
of the A.B. for life.
Or you can handle your
problem by yourself.
I've got respect,
because I earned it.
Anybody fucks with me,
it's their life.
- Where you going?
- You talked to me and I listened.
Hey! Hey.
Don't you be talking out
the side of your neck...
when I'm trying
to do you a solid.
All right.
All right.
Let's get it all out
on the table.
Every time I turn around,
somebody's giving me advice.
Mostly it's
about killing.
So, what's
your interest in me?
There's not much chance
I'm ever getting out.
Those cops of yours
are part of the reason.
That's what
we got in common.
I got my last armed-robbery
conviction behind them.
The rest
is my business.
[ Indistinct ]
It's okay.
Hey.
The directions were good?
You didn't get lost?
It's okay,
sweetheart.
We'll sit here
and talk.
We'll be fine.
So, how's
Albert and Yvonne?
Did he get
the promotion?
Yeah.
They're gonna...
be moving to Seattle.
That's great.
I'm happy for them.
I filed the appeal.
So, how long?
Feldman says
it'll take months.
The chances
of a reversal--
I'm keeping after him.
I call him every day.
I'm making sure that
he keeps me up to date.
[ Sigh ]
I'm sorry.
No, come on.
There's nothing
to be sorry about.
I mean...
we're just
beginning this.
We just got to hold on
and be strong for each other.
And keep trying
everything we can think of.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I can handle this place
if I'm sure of that.
If I'm sure you're all right,
I can.
No matter what happens,
I love you. And no--
That's not ever
gonna change.
I know that.
I love you, too.
I'm all right.
I swear to God I am.
Hi,Jimmie!
Here's the skinny.
From here on out...
your outside money
be goin' on our books.
So we be...
stylin'!
I'm not giving
you anything else.
''I'm not gonna give you
anything else.''
What?
You gonna show us...
what a real convict
you are, sucker?
Don't you ever touch me,
you white motherfucker...
ever!
[ Grunts And Groans ]
You motherfucker!
Come on,Jingles, man.
Get off me,
you mothers!
Come on,
Jingles, man!
Let's get
out of here.
Oh, man.
Rainwood, do yourself
and everyone else some good here.
Give me their names.
I'll make sure
they don't bother you.
I fell.
You need some help.
That's pretty obvious.
I might be new, but I know
how some things work here.
[ Sigh ]
Fine.
You want to be known
as a stand-up guy, fine.
I fell.
You're going into
segregation for 1 5 days.
Maybe that will
jog your memory.
[ Inmate In Cell ]
Who you bringing in now?
Number 6.
[ Yell ]
[ Typewriter ]
[ Chuckling ]
When did he
check back in?
[ Laughing ]
It's my main man.
[ Indistinct ]
Shut the fuck up.
You ain't nothin'.
You ain't nothin'.
This shit
gettin' old yet?
It's only gonna get worse
unless you take him out.
- You talk about it like it's nothing.
- Not nothing.
It's necessary
sometimes.
Maybe you walked away
in the free world...
but not here.
There's no place to go.
Hey, I caught that action
in the yard today.
Looks like the A.B.'s
and the niggers...
goin' be fightin'
over you.
You must be one
flattered motherfucker.
How's your chow?
[ Indistinct ]
You be cool, and everything
will be everything.
Let's take a walk.
Let's go.
Who you lookin' at?
You ain't gettin'no help,
motherfucker. Forget that.
Bring your ass on.
[ Excited Shouts ]
Check it!
That bitch
was sold to us...
by the Muslims for 1 0 cartons
and some drugs.
That made him ours.
Only he didn't
want to be sold.
He wouldn't
give it up to us.
We decided to rough it off,
you know?
You know
what's funny?
I said, ''Do you know
what's really funny?''
There are worse
things than that.
Ain't that
something?
[ Muffled Shouts ]
[ Yells ]
You're gonna
be our kid...
and I ain't
hardly bullshittin'.
Get up.!
You go on back
to your workout.
Being healthy's
a good thing.
[ Felix ]
Get out ofhere.
Oh, Virg, gin.
That makes $500,000...
2-dozen assault rifles,
and 3 teenage girls you owe me.
It really mounts up.
You want some more pruno?
Is a bear Catholic?
I'm ready to deal
with my problem.
Are you straight
with Venucci?
- The guy on the serving line.
- Good.
Sneak some of that
soap back to your house.
- You understand how
the thing's goin' down?
- I understand!
You don't try to hurt him.
You kill him!
Break the piece off
after you stick him!
I understand.
Just trying to get
my mind around it.
Yeah.
Can I have
some more?
Hey.
[ Mumbling ]
Last of the batch.
You get extra.
Yo,Jingles!
It won't be
too long now.
Venucci used
plenty of soap.
And baby...
the first one's
always the hardest.
[ Coughing ]
I'm gonna take that piece
and fuck you with it, punk.
[ Grunts ]
[ Coughing ]
Walk.
Walk out
of here.
Go on, man.
Two points.
Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.
Shoot it, man,
shoot it.!
Oh, all right.!
[ Indistinct ]
[ Alarm ]
I know you did it,
Rainwood.
I don't know anything
about anything.
You should know this.
I can do anything I want
with you in here.
That's right,
Lieutenant.
People like you
have been doing that.
It started with those cops,
went on through the trial...
and now it's your turn,
isn't it?
Take your fucking turn.
I don't give a shit!
Bartlett!
[ Lieutenant ]
90 days in the hole.
A lame like you
won't make it.
You'll come out of there
drooling all over yourself.
I wouldn't
bet on that.
[ Siren ]
- What do you want?
- Now, Katie...
don't start getting
all nervous.
We're tried of hearing
your name come up.
You've been complaining
to agencies all over town.
We even heard from
the mayor's offce.
You're trying to get those
newspaper guys after us.
Not nice.
I'll continue trying
to get my husband freed.
If we didn't know better,
we'd think that...
you were trying to find
a way to take us down.
It's not going to happen, Katie.
People have been
trying for years.
We've been beaten.
Danny was stabbed.
I was shot several times.
Nothing happened.
It's like we're charmed,
you know?
Who can explain it?
You can talk to anybody,
and it won't mean shit.
Like Fitzgerald.
He acts all bad...
but basically,
he's a pencil pusher.
We all know what happened
to your old man.
He wouldn't play along
and he fucked himself.
That was long ago, so forget it
and stop bothering people.
No one can touch us.
You remember that.
They admitted they framed Jimmie.
What more do you want?
I've told you, secondhand
conversations mean nothing.
All right.
They threatened me.
Parnell said that your
department was shit...
and that you were a--
A what?
A punk nigger
with his nose up the brass's ass.
[ Guard ]
Clear the yellow line.
Clear the yellow line.
[ Convict ] Way to do it.
Way to do it, Rainwood.
[ Convict ]
Solidjob, Rainwood.
- [ Guard ] Escort.
- It's Rainwood.
[ Guard ]
Clear for escort.
Escort.
[ Moans ]
[ Virgil ]
Jimmie Rain.
You feelin' a little...
logy, are you?
It's probably too much
rich food lately.
Night life fucked me up, too.
You did a piece of work
and you held your mud.
It's over.
A great flick tomorrow night.
I expect to see you there.
Oh, God,
Danny, Danny, Dan!
I got to stop eating
that Cuban food.
It's ripping up my insides. Ow!
Express your feelings, Mike.
You're a ball of repression!
I'll give you repression.
Right here's repression.
Boom!
[ Fitzgerald ]
Hey, boys. We need to talk.
Well, look who's here.
Off the record.
Kate Rainwood
came to see me.
Kate who-wood?
You put her husband away.
Make your point.
She said
you threatened her.
Did she say that?
The two of you,
stay away from her.
Oh, fuck her.
And fuck you!
Fuck you!
This internal affairs horseshit
is going to your head.
Ow!
Do it, Scalise, do it!
I'll break his
fucking neck!
You stay away
from Kate Rainwood!
I don't like being
called a punk nigger...
boy.
[ Convict ] Hard rain fell
on those motherfuckers. Too bad.
Nice game, man.
Next time,
all right?
You keep thinking that,
I'll keep getting richer, Train.
Yeah, right.
Why don't
you invest that...
vast wealth of yours
in my sports action?
- You got to think about your future.
- Forget it.
I only bet on
a sure thing...
- like your hair getting
gray before you get out.
- Oh.
Lucky fuckin' shot,
Rainwood.
Butcher, man, you still
listening to weight-loss tapes?
Asshole.
They ought to wire
the man's jaws shut.
[Jimmie ] Go ahead.
You can run, but you cannot hide.
[ Virgil ]
Let me think, will ya?
- That hole's getting deeper. Check.
- I was counting on you...
to make up for my
losses to Malcolm.
Is parole still
agreeing with him?
Yeah. He took off some dope
dealers and started business.
He couldn't wait
for a bank loan.
Free enterprise
in action.
She didn't forget how
to make lemon pound cake?
No. She's sending you
the recipe and an apron.
You asshole.
Oh, yeah.
It must be nice to have
Kate out there waiting.
It's everything.
I feel like a kid when she visits.
I walk around for a week
grinning like a maniac.
She kept me strong.
Yeah, they do that,
don't they?
I had someone once.
All right,
you got my attention.
I met her in a bar
one night.
Those days I was
running and ripping;
just daring the man
to catch me.
I was trying
to become a legend.
Lord, the things
you remember.
You got that right.
She was there the night
Parnell and Scalise busted me.
She jumped all over them
and they...
kicked the shit out of her.
You don't forget
things like that.
[ Guard ]
Lock-in.
Janie had heart.
I'll catch you
tomorrow.
Right.
You're in a category
all by yourself in this joint.
You're actually innocent.
Yeah, not like
the rest of these assholes.
So, what's on your mind,
Virg?
You ever think about
getting some pay-back?
Yes, I have.
But they're cops.
- They're also human.
-Just barely.
But...
there's always a way
to take somebody down.
It's not multiple choice.
Yes or no?
It's not me.
I remember when
shanking a man wasn't you.
Give me some respect on this,
will you?
You didn't know
a goddamn thing...
about respect
until I taught you.
Since you're up
for parole...
are you gonna go home,
and live like this never happened?
Don't put me under the gun, man.
I just want
my life back.
How often
does a con...
get a chance to get
some justice, huh?
Or deserve it?
I think I've proven myself...
ready to reenter society...
and start a new life
for myself.
I have a good--
How about the truth?
Hi, members of the parole board.
I've just wasted
over 3 years of my life...
for no fucking reason.
Nah, I don't think
the truth will fly.
Yeah!
I won't be needing these.
Here.
- Where'd you get that stinger?
- Someplace.
Don't blow the power when
you hook it in the socket.
I know how to use it.
I've only been doing time
sinceJesus was a baby.
I hardly wore 'em.
That's my phone number.
I haven't had one for a while,
so don't lose it.
I guess I'm gonna have to watch
the neighborhood by myself.
I guess
that makes you...
- the Mr. Rogers
of the correctional system.
- Ha.
I owe you, man.
Everything.
Thank you.
Wasn't nothing.
I had time to kill, anyway.
Take it slow, Rain.
Don't forget your schooling.
[ Buzzer ]
Ain't life
a motherfucker?
Riding in a car.
You know, Kate...
all things considered...
I think I should've
taken the honor ranch.
New color's great.
What is it?
Robin's egg.
I'm dying for a beer.
Do you want one?
Are you kidding?
You sure you don't want
anything stronger?
Beer is great.
The place looks wonderful, Kate.
I'm so glad you're--
Let me put these down.
[ Gasps ]
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Gasps ]
Oh...
goddamn it!
It's okay.
I thought about
this moment for 3 years.
I wanted it
to be perfect.
We have all the time
in the world.
You're the best.
[ Sigh ]
There's this cabin
we can rent...
up in Arrowhead.
No neighbors
for 1 0 miles.
Guaranteed.
So, what do you think?
In the yard, there was a strong wind
that blew from the west.
I'd look at the mountains
covered with snow.
Sometimes I'd think
that wind was gonna pick me up...
and carry me
over the walls to you.
You'll never know how much
I missed your sweet face.
That's what
kept me alive.
[ Engine Starts ]
[ Car Door Bangs ]
[ Car Door Bangs ]
[ Parnell ]
Rainwood?
Long time, no see.
[ Engine Stops ]
Bad looking ride,
Jimmie.
Come on inside.
We need to have a talk.
It's all right, Kate.
I haven't done anything.
It's okay.
- What are you doing here?
- Nice to see you, Mrs. Rainwood.
You're looking
very good.
We had to make another call
in this part of town.
We thought
we'd stop by.
Mind if we...
sit down?
Sit down.
Honey, get us something
cold to drink, will you?
- What the fuck's wrong?
- I told you to sit your ass down.!
Sit down!
Get us something cold to drink,
goddamn it!
Why don't you,
Katie?
What are you?
Some kind of bad ass
now you did some time?
You can say fuck
and everything.
Don't you ever come out
of your mouth...
like a smart-ass
with me!
Rainwood?
Do you know
who you are?
You are an ex-convict
on parole...
and you are owned
by the state.
The state believes the police,
not the ex-convict, always.
Jimmie,
I don't want you to think...
we're picking on you.
Thank you.
We do this with every
parolee we've busted.
It's kind of like
preventive maintenance.
Guys get weird ideas
in thejoint.
This call is special. You and
your crusading cunt of a wife...
- have caused us a lot--
- Jimmie, please don't.
You wouldn't let go,
and it got you shit.!
Go ahead, Katie...
try to save him like
you couldn't do before.
From now on, Rainwood,
you are a model citizen.
If we happen
to say ''shit,''
you squat.
Understand that,
and it might keep you out of jail.
Jimmie?
Are you all right?
I make shit coffee.
I woke up
and you were gone.
Jimmie?
They're not gonna leave us alone,
you know that?
We go on like this...
they're gonna keep sliding
in and out of our lives.
We can move.
Kate, I'm on parole.
Aren't there
circumstances--
What kind of reason
am I going to give them?
Police persecution?
Christ, my parole agent
would haul me in for observation.
We'll just have to deal with it,
somehow.
They came into our home.!
Jimmie...
you can't fight
these men.
It's not just because
they're police.
They destroy people
whenever they feel like it.
You're not like them.
You don't know me.
I do.
Not anymore.
What are you
talking about?
Talk to me.
You see what's
happening to me...
but it's happening to us.
They're tearing us apart,
and I won't stand for that.
I won't lose you.
I'm gonna stop them.
- What are you going to do?
- Whatever it takes.
Now,you can be in...
or I'll keep you out,
if that's what you want.
Whatever it takes.
I'm here because we don't
know what else to do.
It's like they hauntJimmie.
After they came
to the house--
We need your help.
Malcolm can only do so much.
Those assholes have been
riding high so long...
they think only kryptonite
can take them down.
Of course,
they are...
pea-brain,
dickless shitheads.
Which is...
definitely in our favor.
Definitely!
You've been hoping
for this?
Let's just say,
it makes my decade!
I'll get exactly
the information you need...
and I'll reach out
to you real soon.
You're just like
Jimmie described you;
a schemer
and a charmer.
Thanks for everything
you did for him, Virgil.
You boys got the competition
running for cover.
That's very good work.
I like having only
my dope on the street.
- It makes me feel special.
- Our pleasure.
We think we know how to make
a point, Mr. Donatelli.
[ Donatelli ]
It's Joseph.
You keep making that point
and we'll keep getting wealthier.
Virgil sure
got this shit down.
How long have they
been hooked up?
It's a pretty
recent thing.
Donatelli uses them
to edge out the other dealers.
Any competitors,
he tips Parnell and Scalise...
and they bust 'em.
Fucking cops...
they steal the dope
and Donatelli buys it at discount.
- Mr. Slick there the lawyer?
- Mr. Nate Blitman.
He spreads the
cash tojudges...
and whoever keeps
the focus off Donatelli.
That proves good legal
representation is a must.
Yeah. You ain't lying,
Jimmie Rain.
Same old,
same old.
Your wife tells me
you have a plan...
to put Parnell
and Scalise away.
Yeah. Kate's told me
good things about you.
The problem is
you're a cop, like them.
I'm nothing at all
like them!
I'm here because
your wife asked me.
You need a cop
to make this stick.
If you have something,
let's have it.
- Otherwise, forget it.
- All right, forget it.
Are you crazy?
You won't be fit
to live with unless we do it.
And you have been walking
around whining about proof...
since the day
I met you.!
Work the fucking thing out!
What are you
willing to do?
At this point...
almost anything.
Look,
with your help...
we can get these guys dirty
and put them away.
What do I get
if I agree?
You'll witness them
buying cocaine.
No shit.
You be ready
on a half-hour's notice.
I'll give you
the time and place.
Just you!
No one else.
I'm gonna go along
with you on this...
but if you fuck up
and my ass ends in a sling...
you and I are gonna
go round and round.
I guess I better
not fuck up.
Come here.
Come here.
Look at me.
Too many vitamins,
huh, Stevie?
What do you got?
Coke. 1 0 or 1 2 keys, uncut.
I can tell you
where and when.
You guys grab it
before they step on it...
you're rich.
Who's it belong to?
Reynolds.
- Reynolds.
- Who's Reynolds?
He's new,
just set up.
So?
It'll cost you a grand, man.
You fucking junkie,
son-of-a-bitch!
You fucking junkie,
don't play games with me!
I need the money, man.!
You'll get the rest
when you call.
This better be real.
[ Grunt ]
Hell of a performance.
This thing's gonna
give me a heart attack.
Stevie...
understand that Malcolm
and I know people...
who can find you
anywhere.
I hate those pricks, too.
I've been lookin'
for a chance like this.
Well, you got your money
and your chance.
Take the next ''whatever''
and leave.
[ Boat Whistle ]
[ Parnell ]
All right, freeze. Get down.!
[ Muffled Shouts ]
[ Boat Whistle ]
[ Scalise ] Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.
We're gonna find
you boys a real job.
Oh, you want to get frisky, huh?
[ Scalise ] I'm gonna take you boys
on the whoopee tour.
[ Scalise ]
Up against the wall, now.!
Spread 'em.
- How'd we do?
- There was only about 25 or 30 keys.
- I'm so disappointed.
- [ Chuckle ]
[ Scalise ]
Let's move it.
Got a couple
of live ones for you.
Up against the desk.
- Spread 'em.
- Coke. Almost 2 keys.
You guys trying
for the record?
- [ Parnell ] Yeah,yeah.
- That is unfortunate.
Well, Mr. Blitman.
What are you doing here?
- I heard you have some of our people.
- I don't have--
You're booking two
of Mr. Donatelli's employees.
-Whose employees?
-Mr. Donatelli will expect to see you...
- tomorrow morning.
- Mr. Blitman, could we--
- Don't worry, boys.
- Mr. Blitman?
Please let me out.
I thought they were
working for Reynolds.
[ Parnell ]
One thing is sure...
Donatelli is not gonna
believe this was an accident.
- Look, we call him up.
Tell him what happened.
- Yeah.
We give him back his dope.
It's no big deal.
Right.
- We've been doing this
for a long time, huh?
- Yeah.
We're alive, got some dough,
and we're not in the joint.
- [ Chuckle ]
- Why don't wejust keep the stuff.
We keep it
and we'll split.
Those people in Florida
will give us a good price.
We could leave
the country.
It's not like we don't
have emergency plans.
On your face,
motherfucker.
Now.!
Do it!
Get down.
Get down!
[Jimmie ]
Get the keys.
On your feet.
Put your free hand
on top of your head.
Free hand
on top of your head!
Move to the post!
Do you have any idea
who we are?
Yeah. Two-thirds
ofThe Three Stooges.
[ Laughter]
- Take it easy.
- Fuck you!
- Be cool. Buy some time.
- We better.
They find out we been
ripped off, we dead.
Hey, we'll handle it, man.
How could you be
so stupid!
It was my dope,
and those were my men!
Look...
we'll bring you
your drugs tomorrow.
It's too risky
to touch it today. Really.
By noon tomorrow...
or the world won't be big
enough to swallow you up.
And remember...
if either of you fuck me,
you both fuck me. Understand?
If you fuck me, being
cops won't mean nothin:
I'll kill your families,
then you.
And I'll do it
in pieces.
Now, get out of here.
[ Ringing ]
Yes, special narcotics,
Parnell.
[ Malcolm ] This is one of the guys
that took you off.
Well, what do you want?
Look, we made
a big mistake.
We didn't know the dope
belonged to Donatelli.
- Yeah, you made a big mistake,
all right.
- Okay, okay.
All we want is
some traveling money.
$20,000.
We'll sell it back to you,
and we're gone.
We just want out alive.
- All right. There's this place--
- No, no.
I'll call you back
with the place.
Have the money.
Kate?
You'll call Fitzgerald
in 1 0 minutes?
This doesn't scare you,
does it?
It scares me...
but I can
handle it.
Jimmie?
You said I don't
know you anymore...
but I do.
I've thought a lot about...
what must have
happened to you in prison.
[ Sigh ]
It's not what
happened to me, Kate.
It's what I did.
I promise you, after tonight,
we'll have our lives back.
If something goes wrong,
and I wind up in prison--
Jimmie.
If I wind up
back in prison...
you have
to promise me...
that you'll move on
with your life.
I don't want you
to hold on again.
I love you
too much for that.
I can't make that
promise to you.
So, I guess you'll just
have to come back to me...
Jimmie Rain.
$20,000 for three-quarters
of a million in coke.
It's not a bad deal.
Come on,
you're doing the right thing.
-Just think of it as early retirement.
- Right.
We'll be in Florida
before Donatelli misses us.
[ Parnell ]
Be sure you get a receipt.
[ Car Engine Starts ]
- Anything?
- No. Looks all clear.
Drive by the shops, huh?
We got company.
- You guys miss your bus?
- You the man?
Turn around.
Spread your legs.
He's clean.
[ Malcolm ] I'm gonna tell you
exactly how it goes.
You give me the money.
When my partner sees me drive off...
he'll put the rest in that barrel.
Got it?
- I want my dope now!
- Slow down.
I don't want to, Danny.
Who is this creep?
I'm your daddy,
punk!
Back off.
[ Scalise ]
Look, here's the bread.
All right,
I'm gone, gentlemen.
Are you crazy?
- [ Parnell ] Shut up.!
- Shit.
- Mike.
- Shut up.
I'm not gonna let shit
like this order me around.
Get your partner here
in 5 seconds with the dope...
or I'll blow your
fucking brains out here.
You understand?
Now do it.
Jimmie?
Jimmie!
[ Malcolm ]
Yo,Jimmie.!
Jimmie.!
- Let him go!
- Rainwood!
Let him go.
I've got it.
- Okay. You go and get the stuff.
- Yeah.
And put it
in the car.
Come out here
where I can see you.
Put the bag down
right here.
Up against the car.
Hands on the trunk.
You know the position,
Rainwood.
Uh-huh,
what have we here?
Oh, Mike, it's yours.
Turn around.
You got balls, Rainwood.
I give you that.
I'm just gonna...
pick up
this little bag here...
and take a stroll.
If you try anything tricky,
then we'll shoot you.
Now let him go.
Rainwood,
you son-of-a-bitch.
[ Grunt ]
Police!
Danny, meet me
at the entrance.
Give it up,
Scalise!
Give it up.!
Don't do it!
Hey, man, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you.
I'm a police officer.
There's a man hurt back there.
Police officer.
[ Yells ]
I'm gonna
cut you in half.
I wouldn't
bet on that.
[ Yell ]
[ Kate ]
Jimmie.!
[ Guard ]
Clear the yellow line.
Clear the yellow line.
[ Convict ]
New fish. Fish on the line.
[ Virgil ]
Hey, Offcer.
Ain't life
a motherfucker?
"Hold on "
"I'll be back for you
it won't be long "
"But for now
there's something there "
" That's calling me "
"So take me down
a lonesome road "
"Point me east
and let me go "
" This suitcase
weighs me down "
" With memories "
"I just want to be
the one you run to "
"I just want to be
the one you come to "
"I just want to be there
with someone "
" When the night comes "
"Let's put all our cares
behind us "
"And go where
they'll never find us "
"I just want to be there
beside you "
" When the night comes
When the night comes "
"I know there'll
be a time "
" When you and I "
" Could take our hands
and run away "
"Pick up all the pieces "
" Of this shattered dream "
- " We're gonna make it out someday "
- "Make it out someday "
" We'll be coming back "
" Coming back today "
" Ooow "
" When the night comes "
"I want to be the one
you run to "
" Oh,
when the night comes "
" To be the one
you come to "
- " Oh, when the night comes "
- "I want to be the one you run to "
- " Oh "
- "Aaah "
"I just want to be
the one you run to "
" Wanna be the one
you come to "
"I just want to be there
with someone "
" When the night comes
When the night comes "
" Oh, oh,
when the night comes "
" When the night
runs out "
" Oh, oh,
when the night comes "
"I wanna be with you "
" Oh, oh,
when the night comes "
" Oh, when the night comes in "
