<b><i>Long before the birth
of light, there was darkness.</i></b>
<b><i>And from that darkness
came the Dark Elves.</i></b>
<b><i>Millennia ago, the most
ruthless of their kind, Malekith</i></b>
<b><i>sought to transform our universe
back into one of eternal night.</i></b>
<b><i>Such evil was possible through
the power of the Aether,</i></b>
<b><i>an ancient force of
infinite destruction.</i></b>
<b>Malekith.</b>
<b>Asgard's forces are upon us.</b>
<b>The noble armies of Asgard,
led by my father, King Bor,</b>
<b>waged a mighty war
against these creatures.</b>
<b>Send in the Kursed!</b>
<b>As the Nine Worlds
converged above him,</b>
<b>Malekith could at last
unleash the Aether.</b>
<b>Ahh!</b>
<b>But Asgard ripped
the weapon from his grasp.</b>
<b>Without it, the Dark Elves fell.</b>
<b>With the battle all but lost,</b>
<b>Malekith sacrificed his own people</b>
<b>in a desperate attempt to lay
waste to Asgard's army.</b>
<b>Their deaths will
mean our survival.</b>
<b>This war is far from over.</b>
<b>Malekith was vanquished,
and the Aether was no more.</b>
<b>Or so we were led to believe.</b>
<b>Sire, the Aether.
Shall we destroy it?</b>
<b>If only we could.</b>
<b>But its power is too great.</b>
<b>Bury it deep.</b>
<b>Somewhere no one will ever find it.</b>
<b>Loki.</b>
<b>Hello, Mother.</b>
<b>Have I made you proud?</b>
<b>Please, don't make this worse.</b>
<b>Define "worse."</b>
<b>Enough!</b>
<b>I will speak to the prisoner alone.</b>
<b>I really don't see
what all the fuss is about.</b>
<b>Do you not truly feel
the gravity of your crimes?</b>
<b>Wherever you go, there is war, ruin,</b>
<b>and death.</b>
<b>I went down to Midgard to rule the
people of Earth as a benevolent god.</b>
<b>Just like you.</b>
<b>We are not gods.
We are born, we live, we die.</b>
<b>Just as humans do.</b>
<b>Give or take 5,000 years.</b>
<b>All this because Loki
desires a throne.</b>
<b>It is my birthright.</b>
<b>Your birthright was to die</b>
<b>as a child.</b>
<b>Cast out onto a frozen rock.</b>
<b>If I had not taken you in,</b>
<b>you would not be
here now to hate me.</b>
<b>If I am for the axe,
then for mercy's sake,</b>
<b>just swing it.</b>
<b>It's not that I don't
love our little talks,</b>
<b>it's just...</b>
<b>I don't love them.</b>
<b>Frigga is the only reason
you're still alive,</b>
<b>and you will never see her again.</b>
<b>You will spend the rest of
your days in the dungeons.</b>
<b>And what of Thor?</b>
<b>You'll make that witless oaf
king while I rot in chains.</b>
<b>Thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done.</b>
<b>He will bring order
to the Nine Realms</b>
<b>and then, yes...</b>
<b>He will be king.</b>
<b>Ah!</b>
<b>I've got this completely
under control!</b>
<b>Is that why everything is on fire?</b>
<b>Ah!</b>
<b>You're welcome.</b>
<b>Ha!</b>
<b>All yours.</b>
<b>Hello.</b>
<b>I accept your surrender.</b>
<b>Anyone else?</b>
<b>Perhaps next time we should
start with the big one.</b>
<b>Keep moving. Come on!</b>
<b>Keep moving. Go ahead of me.
Don't you turn around!</b>
<b>Where do we go next?</b>
<b>Hogun, the peace is nearly won
across the Nine Realms.</b>
<b>You should stay here. Be with
your people, where your heart is.</b>
<b>Asgard can wait.</b>
<b>You have my thanks.</b>
<b>As you have mine.</b>
<b>Heimdall, when you're ready.</b>
<b>Is Vanaheim secure?</b>
<b>As are Nornheim and Ria.</b>
<b>Though our work would have gone
more quickly with you at the fore.</b>
<b>You must think I'm a piece of bread
that needs to be buttered so heavily.</b>
<b>That was not my intent.</b>
<b>For the first time
since Bifrost was destroyed,</b>
<b>the Nine Realms are at peace.</b>
<b>They're well reminded
of our strength</b>
<b>and you have earned their
respect and my gratitude.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>Nothing out of order</b>
<b>except your confused
and distracted heart.</b>
<b>This isn't about
Jane Foster, Father.</b>
<b>Human lives are fleeting,
they're nothing.</b>
<b>You'd be better served
by what lies in front of you.</b>
<b>I'm telling you this,
not as the Allfather,</b>
<b>but as your father.</b>
<b>You are ready.</b>
<b>The time has come
for you to take the throne.</b>
<b>Embrace and celebrate
what you've won.</b>
<b>Join your warriors.</b>
<b>Eat and drink,
revel in their celebration.</b>
<b>At least pretend to enjoy yourself.</b>
<b>Another!</b>
<b>There was a time when you
would celebrate for weeks.</b>
<b>I remember you celebrated
the Battle of Harokin</b>
<b>so much that you nearly
started the second.</b>
<b>Well, the first was so much fun.</b>
<b>Take a drink with me.</b>
<b>Surely, the Allfather could have
no further task for you tonight.</b>
<b>No, this is one I set myself.</b>
<b>It does not go unnoticed that
you disappear each night.</b>
<b>There are nine realms.</b>
<b>The future king of Asgard
must focus on more than one.</b>
<b>I thank you for your sword</b>
<b>and for your counsel,
good Lady Sif.</b>
<b>Hi.</b>
<b>Hi.</b>
<b>So, what's the story with you?</b>
<b>Why does there have to be a story?
There's no story.</b>
<b>You spent the first
ten minutes of our date</b>
<b>hiding behind a menu
that has three choices on it.</b>
<b>It's either chicken,
vegetarian, or fish, Jane.</b>
<b>I think there's a story</b>
<b>and I'm thinking
the story involves a guy.</b>
<b>It's complicated.</b>
<b>Is he still around?</b>
<b>No, he...</b>
<b>Went away.</b>
<b>I've been there.</b>
<b>The going away.
It's hard, isn't it?</b>
<b>I was seeing a woman</b>
<b>and she took a job in New York.</b>
<b>Eventually, the distance killed it.</b>
<b>And the fact that she kept
sleeping with other dudes.</b>
<b>- No!
- Oh, so many.</b>
<b>Hi. Could we get some wine, please?</b>
<b>Sure, I'd love some.</b>
<b>Richard, this is Darcy.</b>
<b>What are you doing here?</b>
<b>Oh. Hello.</b>
<b>So, I show up to work
at the lab/your mom's house,</b>
<b>fully expecting you to be
moping around in your pajamas,</b>
<b>eating ice cream and
obsessing about...</b>
<b>You know who.</b>
<b>Ah.</b>
<b>But you're not.
You're wearing lady clothes.</b>
<b>You even showered, didn't you?
You smell good.</b>
<b>Is there a point to all this?</b>
<b>Because there really needs
to be a point to all this.</b>
<b>Right.</b>
<b>You know all that scientific
equipment you don't look at anymore?</b>
<b>You might want
to start looking at it again.</b>
<b>This is the reason
we came all the way out here.</b>
<b>It's malfunctioning.</b>
<b>That's what I said.</b>
<b>That's what I did.</b>
<b>I thought you would do something
a little more scientific.</b>
<b>- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's...</b>
<b>It doesn't look like nothing.</b>
<b>It kind of looks like the readings
that Erik was rambling about.</b>
<b>Our friend Erik</b>
<b>kind of went banana balls.</b>
<b>He's not interested.</b>
<b>- I'm not interested.
- I'm interested.</b>
<b>It's time for you to go now.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Short but sweet.</b>
<b>She needs help.</b>
<b>I think I'm going to
have the sea bass.</b>
<b>Sea bass, yeah.
Sea bass is good.</b>
<b>Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.</b>
<b>Sea bass...</b>
<b>Sea bass.</b>
<b>Jane?</b>
<b>Maybe you should stop
saying "sea bass"</b>
<b>and go after your friend.</b>
<b>This was so fun.</b>
<b>I'll just stay here
and say "sea bass" alone.</b>
<b>And I hate you.</b>
<b>What? I said he was cute.</b>
<b>Just shut up and drive.</b>
<b>You need to take the next left.</b>
<b>- Who's he?
- He's my intern.</b>
<b>- You have an intern?
- Oh, yeah.</b>
<b>Hello, Dr. Foster.</b>
<b>It's such a great honor
to be working with you.</b>
<b>Right. I have to call Erik.</b>
<b>Oh, take a right.</b>
<b>And a left.</b>
<b>I have totally
mastered driving in London.</b>
<b>Hi, Erik. It's me again.
Where are you?</b>
<b>I came here because you said you were
onto something, and then you vanish.</b>
<b>I'm here at Stonehenge</b>
<b>for what has been an interesting
unfolding of events today.</b>
<b>The police were called to the scene</b>
<b>shortly after 11 A.M.
this morning</b>
<b>after a seemingly harmless
rambler approached the area</b>
<b>then, decided to strip naked
and effectively</b>
<b>terrorize tourists there
with scientific equipment</b>
<b>whilst shouting that he
was trying to save them.</b>
<b>The man, later identified as noted
astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</b>
<b>has been called in
for questioning by police.</b>
<b>Come on, this is exciting.</b>
<b>Look! The intern is excited.</b>
<b>"Ian."</b>
<b>Do you want the phase meter?</b>
<b>- No.
- Bring the phase meter.</b>
<b>The toaster-looking thing.</b>
<b>Yeah.
I know what the phase meter is.</b>
<b>How do I change the
ringtone on this thing?</b>
<b>An astrophysicist with three degrees</b>
<b>should be able to change
her own ringtone.</b>
<b>Why are you calling me?</b>
<b>I didn't want to shout.
Intern says it's this way.</b>
<b>- "Ian." My name is Ian.
- Shh.</b>
<b>I am not getting stabbed
in the name of science.</b>
<b>It's okay, we're Americans.</b>
<b>Is that supposed to
make them like us?</b>
<b>- They'll make it go away.
- Shh.</b>
<b>Oh, they're kids.</b>
<b>Are you the police?</b>
<b>No, we're scientists.
Well, I am.</b>
<b>Thanks.</b>
<b>We just found it.</b>
<b>Can you show us?</b>
<b>That doesn't seem right.</b>
<b>Where'd it go?</b>
<b>That's...</b>
<b>That's incredible!</b>
<b>What happened?</b>
<b>Sometimes they come back.</b>
<b>Sometimes they don't.</b>
<b>I want to throw something!</b>
<b>Jane, give me your shoe.</b>
<b>I haven't seen readings
like this since...</b>
<b>Since...</b>
<b>New Mexico?</b>
<b>Don't touch anything!</b>
<b>Give me your shoe.</b>
<b>Oh.</b>
<b>Were those the car keys?</b>
<b>Whoa. Ah!</b>
<b>Oh!</b>
<b>Darcy!</b>
<b>Oh!</b>
<b>The Aether awakens us.</b>
<b>The Convergence returns.</b>
<b>You're late.</b>
<b>Merriment can sometimes be a
heavier burden than battle.</b>
<b>Then you're doing
one of them incorrectly.</b>
<b>Perhaps.</b>
<b>How fare the stars?</b>
<b>Still shining.</b>
<b>From here, I can see nine
realms and ten trillion souls.</b>
<b>Do you recall what I taught
you of the Convergence?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>The alignment of the worlds.</b>
<b>It approaches, doesn't it?</b>
<b>The universe hasn't seen this
marvel since before my watch began.</b>
<b>Few can sense it.
Even fewer can see it.</b>
<b>But while its effects
can be dangerous,</b>
<b>it is truly beautiful.</b>
<b>I see nothing.</b>
<b>Or, perhaps, that is not
the beauty you seek.</b>
<b>How is she?</b>
<b>She's quite clever,
your mortal.</b>
<b>She doesn't know it yet,</b>
<b>but she studies
the Convergence as well.</b>
<b>Even...</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>I can't see her.</b>
<b>Jane!</b>
<b>Where the hell were you?</b>
<b>Tell me you didn't call the police.</b>
<b>What was I supposed to do?</b>
<b>- Not call the police.
- I was freaking out.</b>
<b>You call the cops,
they call the Feds.</b>
<b>Next thing you know, we have
S.H.I.E.L.D. crawling all over</b>
<b>- "Area 51-ing" the place.
- Jane.</b>
<b>We had a stable gravitation anomaly.</b>
<b>We had unimpeded access.</b>
<b>Our only competition
was ten years old!</b>
<b>Jane!
You were gone for five hours.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>That's weird.</b>
<b>Typical</b>
<b>Jane.</b>
<b>Sorry. I just needed
to make sure you were real.</b>
<b>It's been a very strange day.</b>
<b>I am. Jane, what...</b>
<b>Where were you?</b>
<b>Where were you?</b>
<b>Heimdall cannot see you.</b>
<b>I was right here where you left me.</b>
<b>I was waiting,
and then I was crying</b>
<b>and then I went out
looking for you.</b>
<b>You said you were coming back.</b>
<b>I know. I know, but the
Bifrost was destroyed.</b>
<b>The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.</b>
<b>Wars were raging,
marauders were pillaging.</b>
<b>I had to put an
end to the slaughter.</b>
<b>As excuses go, it's not terrible.</b>
<b>But I saw you on TV.
You were in New York!</b>
<b>Jane, I fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world</b>
<b>but I was wrong.</b>
<b>I was a fool.</b>
<b>But I believe that fate
brought us together.</b>
<b>Jane, I don't know where you were,
or what happened, but I do know this...</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>I know...</b>
<b>You do?</b>
<b>Do what?</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>Hey!</b>
<b>Is this you?</b>
<b>Uh, we're kind of in the middle
of something here.</b>
<b>Um, I'm pretty sure
we are getting arrested.</b>
<b>Hold that thought.</b>
<b>Look at you, still all
muscly and everything.</b>
<b>How's space?</b>
<b>Space is fine.</b>
<b>Excuse me.</b>
<b>- Are you Jane Foster?
- Yes.</b>
<b>Do you know this man?</b>
<b>He's my intern.</b>
<b>My intern's intern.</b>
<b>This is private property and you're
trespassing, the lot of you.</b>
<b>You'll have to come with me.</b>
<b>Jane.</b>
<b>- Jane.
- Thor?</b>
<b>Are you all right?</b>
<b>What just happened?</b>
<b>Place your hands
on your heads. Step back.</b>
<b>This woman is unwell.</b>
<b>She's dangerous.</b>
<b>So am I.</b>
<b>Requesting armed response
officers to scene.</b>
<b>- Hold on to me.
- What are you doing?</b>
<b>Holy shit.</b>
<b>We have to do that again.</b>
<b>Hi.</b>
<b>Welcome to Asgard.</b>
<b>Look upon my legacy, Algrim.</b>
<b>I can barely remember a time
before the light.</b>
<b>Our survival will be your legacy.</b>
<b>The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.</b>
<b>I will reclaim the Aether.</b>
<b>I will restore our world.</b>
<b>And I will put an end
to this poisoned universe.</b>
<b>What's that?</b>
<b>Be still.</b>
<b>This is not of Earth.
What is it?</b>
<b>We do not know.</b>
<b>But she will not survive the amount
of energy surging within her.</b>
<b>That's a quantum field
generator, isn't it?</b>
<b>It's a soul forge.</b>
<b>Does a soul forge transfer molecular
energy from one place to another?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Quantum field generator.</b>
<b>My words are mere noises to you
that you ignore them completely?</b>
<b>She is ill.</b>
<b>She is mortal.</b>
<b>Illness is their defining trait.</b>
<b>I brought her here
because we can help her.</b>
<b>She does not belong here in Asgard</b>
<b>any more than a goat
belongs at a banquet table.</b>
<b>Did he just...</b>
<b>Who do you think you are?</b>
<b>I am Odin, King of Asgard.</b>
<b>Protector of the Nine Realms.</b>
<b>Oh. Well, I'm...</b>
<b>I know very well who you are,
Jane Foster.</b>
<b>You told your dad about me?</b>
<b>Something is within her, Father.</b>
<b>Something I have not seen before.</b>
<b>Her world has its healers.</b>
<b>They are called "doctors."
Let them deal with it.</b>
<b>Guards, take her back to Midgard.</b>
<b>No, I would not...</b>
<b>touch her.</b>
<b>Jane, are you all right?</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>It's impossible.</b>
<b>The infection...
It's defending her.</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>It's defending itself.</b>
<b>Come with me.</b>
<b>There are relics that
pre-date the universe itself.</b>
<b>What lies within her
appears to be one of them.</b>
<b>The Nine Realms are not eternal.</b>
<b>They had a dawn</b>
<b>as they will have a dusk.</b>
<b>But before that dawn</b>
<b>the dark forces, the Dark Elves,
reigned absolute and unchallenged.</b>
<b>"Born of eternal night</b>
<b>"the Dark Elves come
to steal away the light."</b>
<b>I know these stories.
Mother told them to us as children.</b>
<b>Their leader Malekith made a
weapon out of that darkness</b>
<b>and it was called the Aether.</b>
<b>While the other relics
often appear as stones</b>
<b>the Aether is fluid
and everchanging.</b>
<b>It changes matter into dark matter.</b>
<b>It seeks out host bodies, drawing
strength from their life-force.</b>
<b>Malekith sought to use
the Aether's power</b>
<b>to return the universe
to one of darkness.</b>
<b>But, after eternities of bloodshed</b>
<b>my father Bor finally triumphed</b>
<b>ushering in a peace
that lasted thousands of years.</b>
<b>What happened?</b>
<b>He killed them all.</b>
<b>Are you certain?</b>
<b>The Aether was said to have
been destroyed with them,</b>
<b>and yet here it is.</b>
<b>The Dark Elves are dead.</b>
<b>Does your book happen to mention
how to get it out of me?</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>It does not.</b>
<b>The worlds are nearly aligned.</b>
<b>You will be the last of the Kursed.</b>
<b>Let my life be sacrificed.</b>
<b>It is no less than our people did,</b>
<b>or you have done.</b>
<b>You will become darkness.</b>
<b>Cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.</b>
<b>Until then, no power our enemies
possess can stop you.</b>
<b>I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn.</b>
<b>Acting as caretakers to these
scoundrels is beneath us.</b>
<b>Oh, please!
If they were beneath you,</b>
<b>my rotund friend,
they'd all be dead.</b>
<b>- Keep in line!
- Move it!</b>
<b>Odin continues to
bring me new friends.</b>
<b>How thoughtful.</b>
<b>The books I sent,
do they not interest you?</b>
<b>Is that how I am to while
away eternity? Reading?</b>
<b>I've done everything in my power
to make you comfortable, Loki.</b>
<b>Have you?</b>
<b>Does Odin share your concern?</b>
<b>Does Thor?</b>
<b>It must be so inconvenient, them
asking after me day and night.</b>
<b>You know full well it was your
actions that brought you here.</b>
<b>My actions?</b>
<b>I was merely giving truth to the lie
that I had been fed my entire life...</b>
<b>That I was born to be a king.</b>
<b>A king?</b>
<b>A true king admits his faults.</b>
<b>What of the lives you took on Earth?</b>
<b>A mere handful
compared to the number</b>
<b>that Odin has taken himself.</b>
<b>- Your father...
- He's not my father!</b>
<b>Then am I not your mother?</b>
<b>You're not.</b>
<b>You're always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself.</b>
<b>When you came for me,
you knew I was in trouble.</b>
<b>Heimdall had lost sight of you.</b>
<b>You were no longer on Earth.</b>
<b>How is that possible?</b>
<b>I believe you were
and you weren't.</b>
<b>The Nine Realms
travel within Yggdrasil</b>
<b>orbiting Midgard much the way
your planets orbit the sun.</b>
<b>And every 5,000 years,
the worlds align perfectly</b>
<b>and we call this the Convergence.</b>
<b>During this time, the borders
between worlds become blurred.</b>
<b>It's possible you found
one of these points.</b>
<b>We are lucky that it remained open.</b>
<b>Once the worlds pass
out of alignment</b>
<b>then the connection is lost.</b>
<b>I like the way you explain things.</b>
<b>What's going to happen to me?</b>
<b>I'll find a way to save you, Jane.</b>
<b>- Your father said there was...
- My father doesn't know everything.</b>
<b>Don't let him hear you say that.</b>
<b>Jane Foster...</b>
<b>Please meet Frigga,</b>
<b>Queen of Asgard, and my mother.</b>
<b>Hi.</b>
<b>Move!</b>
<b>To the dungeons!</b>
<b>Come on!</b>
<b>You might want to take
the stairs to the left.</b>
<b>The prisons.</b>
<b>- Loki...
- Go.</b>
<b>I will look after her.</b>
<b>It's as if they resent
being imprisoned!</b>
<b>There's no pleasing some creatures.</b>
<b>Return to your cells, no
further harm will come to you.</b>
<b>You have my word.</b>
<b>Very well, you do
not have my word.</b>
<b>Send a squadron
to the weapons vault.</b>
<b>Defend it at all costs.
Secure the dungeon.</b>
<b>- Odin.
- Frigga.</b>
<b>Go!</b>
<b>It's a skirmish.</b>
<b>Nothing to fear.</b>
<b>You've never been a very good liar.</b>
<b>Take her to your chambers.</b>
<b>I'll come for you when it's safe.</b>
<b>You take care.</b>
<b>Despite all I have survived,</b>
<b>my queen still worries over me.</b>
<b>It's only because
I worry over you</b>
<b>that you have survived.</b>
<b>Listen to me now.</b>
<b>I need you to do everything
I ask, no questions.</b>
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>
<b>Oh!</b>
<b>- Ow!
- Ah!</b>
<b>The throne of Asgard
is destroyed! To the king!</b>
<b>Frigga.</b>
<b>Stand down, creature,</b>
<b>and you may still survive this.</b>
<b>I have survived worse, woman.</b>
<b>Who are you?</b>
<b>I am Malekith.</b>
<b>And I would have what is mine.</b>
<b>Ah!</b>
<b>You have taken something, child.</b>
<b>Give it back.</b>
<b>Witch!</b>
<b>Where is the Aether?</b>
<b>I'll never tell you.</b>
<b>I believe you.</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>The universe rotates
on a 5,000-year cycle</b>
<b>and once a cycle,
all the worlds align.</b>
<b>Imagine... Imagine that
this is our world.</b>
<b>Oh, thank you.
And this is another world.</b>
<b>Normally, they're separate.</b>
<b>But during the Alignment,</b>
<b>everything is connected,
all nine realms.</b>
<b>All nine realms are passing
through each other</b>
<b>and gravity, light,
and even matter,</b>
<b>is crashing from one
world to the other.</b>
<b>But if this happens to us now,
the result will be cataclysmic.</b>
<b>My gravimetric spikes can stabilize
the focal point of the Convergence.</b>
<b>This time, the Alignment</b>
<b>and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.</b>
<b>It's beautiful.</b>
<b>It's simple. Any questions?</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>Can I have my shoe back?</b>
<b>Heal. You will need your
strength to reclaim the Aether.</b>
<b>And when you wake,
we will kill them all.</b>
<b>Jane Foster?</b>
<b>You need to come with us.</b>
<b>We are still unable to
restore the palace shields.</b>
<b>Our artillery cannot detect them.</b>
<b>Even Heimdall cannot see them.</b>
<b>My king, we are all but defenseless.</b>
<b>She's your prisoner now?</b>
<b>Leave us.</b>
<b>I do not wish to fight with you.</b>
<b>Nor I with you.</b>
<b>But I intend to pursue Malekith.</b>
<b>We possess the Aether.</b>
<b>Malekith will come to us.</b>
<b>Yes, and he will destroy us.</b>
<b>You overestimate the
power of these creatures.</b>
<b>No, I value our people's lives.</b>
<b>I'll take Jane to the Dark World, and
draw the enemy away from Asgard.</b>
<b>When Malekith pulls
the Aether from Jane,</b>
<b>it will be exposed and vulnerable.</b>
<b>And I will destroy it and him.</b>
<b>If you fail, you risk this weapon</b>
<b>falling into the hands
of our enemies.</b>
<b>The risk is far greater
if we do nothing.</b>
<b>His ship could be over
our heads right now,</b>
<b>we would never even know it.</b>
<b>If and when he comes</b>
<b>his men will fall on
10,000 Asgardian blades.</b>
<b>And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?</b>
<b>As many as are needed!</b>
<b>Ah!</b>
<b>We will fight!</b>
<b>Till the last Asgardian breath.</b>
<b>Till the last drop
of Asgardian blood.</b>
<b>Then how are you
different from Malekith?</b>
<b>The difference, my son,
is that I will win.</b>
<b>Jane isn't calling me back,
Erik isn't calling me back,</b>
<b>stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't calling me back.</b>
<b>- What's S.H.I.E.L.D?
- It's a secret.</b>
<b>Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.</b>
<b>Thor came back,
he took Jane to Asgard,</b>
<b>and I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.</b>
<b>Something else
went missing this week</b>
<b>when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</b>
<b>notable for his involvement in
the alien invasion of New York</b>
<b>streaked nude across...</b>
<b>Darcy, you really
need to look at this.</b>
<b>Your friend, Erik...</b>
<b>What was his last name again?</b>
<b>And began shouting at visitors
to the historic site.</b>
<b>He was later taken
into police custody</b>
<b>for psychiatric evaluation.</b>
<b>Police are still
refusing to confirm...</b>
<b>You were not at Odin's war council.</b>
<b>The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.</b>
<b>No one is to come</b>
<b>or to go.</b>
<b>We face an enemy
that is invisible even to me.</b>
<b>What use is a guardian such as that?</b>
<b>Malekith will return,
you know this.</b>
<b>I need your help.</b>
<b>I cannot overrule my king's wishes.
Not even for you.</b>
<b>I'm not asking you to.</b>
<b>The realms need their Allfather
strong and unchallenged</b>
<b>whether he is or not.</b>
<b>But he is blinded, Heimdall</b>
<b>by hatred and by grief.</b>
<b>As are we all.</b>
<b>I see clearly enough.</b>
<b>The risks are too great.</b>
<b>Everything we do from
here on is a risk.</b>
<b>There is no other way.</b>
<b>What do you require of me?</b>
<b>What I'm about to ask of you
is treason of the highest order.</b>
<b>Success will bring us exile and
failure shall mean our death.</b>
<b>Malekith knew the Aether was here.
He can sense its power.</b>
<b>If we do nothing,
he will come for it again</b>
<b>but this time, lay waste
to all of Asgard.</b>
<b>We must move
Jane off-world.</b>
<b>The Bifrost has been shut down</b>
<b>and the Tesseract
locked away in the vault.</b>
<b>There are other paths off Asgard.
Ways known only to a few.</b>
<b>One, actually.</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>Thor. After all this time</b>
<b>and now you come to visit me.</b>
<b>Why?</b>
<b>Have you come to gloat?
To mock?</b>
<b>Loki, enough.</b>
<b>No more illusions.</b>
<b>Now you see me, brother.</b>
<b>Did she suffer?</b>
<b>I did not come here
to share our grief.</b>
<b>Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.</b>
<b>Go on.</b>
<b>I know you seek vengeance
as much as I do.</b>
<b>You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.</b>
<b>Vengeance</b>
<b>and afterward, this cell.</b>
<b>You must be truly desperate
to come to me for help.</b>
<b>What makes you think
you can trust me?</b>
<b>I don't.</b>
<b>Mother did.</b>
<b>But you should know that when
we fought each other in the past,</b>
<b>I did so with a glimmer of hope</b>
<b>that my brother
was still in there somewhere.</b>
<b>That hope no longer exists
to protect you.</b>
<b>You betray me, and I will kill you.</b>
<b>Hmm.</b>
<b>When do we start?</b>
<b>He will betray you.</b>
<b>He will try.</b>
<b>This is so unlike you, brother.</b>
<b>So clandestine.</b>
<b>Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?</b>
<b>If you keep speaking,
I just might.</b>
<b>Fine. As you wish.</b>
<b>I'm not even here.</b>
<b>Is this better?</b>
<b>It's better company at least.</b>
<b>Still, we could be
less conspicuous.</b>
<b>Mmm, brother, you look ravishing.</b>
<b>It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.</b>
<b>Very well. Perhaps you
prefer one of your new companions</b>
<b>given that you seem
to like them so much.</b>
<b>Oh, this is much better.</b>
<b>Ooh.</b>
<b>The costume is a bit much.
So tight.</b>
<b>But the confidence...</b>
<b>I can feel the
righteousness surging.</b>
<b>Hey, do you want to have a
rousing discussion about truth?</b>
<b>Honor? Patriotism?</b>
<b>God bless Amer...</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>You could at least furnish
me with a weapon.</b>
<b>My dagger, something.</b>
<b>At last.</b>
<b>A little common sense.</b>
<b>And I thought you liked tricks.</b>
<b>Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is
being guarded by a legion of Einherjar</b>
<b>who will see you coming
from miles away.</b>
<b>I won't be the one
who comes for her.</b>
<b>I'm not hungry.</b>
<b>What the...</b>
<b>Good. Let's go.</b>
<b>You're...</b>
<b>I'm Loki,
you may have heard of me.</b>
<b>That was for New York.</b>
<b>I like her.</b>
<b>And what of the Allfather?</b>
<b>It is my sworn duty to notify him
of crimes against the throne.</b>
<b>You called me here
on an urgent matter.</b>
<b>What is it?</b>
<b>Treason, my lord.</b>
<b>Whose?</b>
<b>Mine.</b>
<b>My king!</b>
<b>The mortal has been taken.</b>
<b>Stop Thor.</b>
<b>By any means necessary.</b>
<b>There they are! Take them.</b>
<b>On my command.</b>
<b>I'll hold them off.
Take her.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>Betray him, and I'll kill you.</b>
<b>It's good to see you, too, Sif.</b>
<b>Assuming you can get Loki's help
and you can free this mortal</b>
<b>what good would it do?</b>
<b>We'd all be dead the minute we
step one foot outside the palace.</b>
<b>That, my friend, is why we
won't be leaving by foot.</b>
<b>I will give you as
much time as I can.</b>
<b>Thank you, my friend.</b>
<b>If you even think
about betraying him...</b>
<b>You'll kill me?</b>
<b>Evidently, there will be a line.</b>
<b>I thought you said you knew
how to fly this thing.</b>
<b>I said, "How hard could it be?"</b>
<b>They're on the ship!</b>
<b>Get to the ship!</b>
<b>Well, whatever you're doing, brother,
I suggest you do it faster.</b>
<b>Shut up, Loki.</b>
<b>You must have missed something.</b>
<b>No, I didn't. I'm pressing
every button on this thing.</b>
<b>No, don't hit it.
Just press it gently.</b>
<b>I'm pressing it gently,
it's not working!</b>
<b>Ha, ha!</b>
<b>Get him! Get him!</b>
<b>- I think you missed a column.
- Shut up!</b>
<b>Look, why don't
you let me take over?</b>
<b>I'm clearly the better pilot.</b>
<b>Is that right?
Well, out of the two of us,</b>
<b>which one can actually fly?</b>
<b>Oh, dear. Is she dead?</b>
<b>Jane.</b>
<b>I'm okay.</b>
<b>Ah!</b>
<b>Not a word.</b>
<b>Now they're following us.</b>
<b>Now they're firing at us.</b>
<b>Yeah, thank you
for the commentary, Loki,</b>
<b>it's not at all distracting!</b>
<b>Well done. You just
decapitated your grandfather.</b>
<b>You know, this is wonderful.</b>
<b>This is a tremendous idea.</b>
<b>Let's steal the biggest,
most obvious ship in the universe</b>
<b>and escape in that.</b>
<b>Flying around the city,</b>
<b>smashing into everything in
sight so everyone can see us.</b>
<b>It's brilliant, Thor!
It's truly brilliant!</b>
<b>I see your time in the dungeons</b>
<b>has made you no less graceful, Loki.</b>
<b>You lied to me.</b>
<b>I'm impressed.</b>
<b>I'm glad you're pleased.</b>
<b>Now, do as you promised.</b>
<b>And take us to your secret pathway.</b>
<b>- Fandral.
- Right.</b>
<b>For Asgard.</b>
<b>Nothing personal, boys.</b>
<b>Loki...</b>
<b>if it were easy,
everyone would do it.</b>
<b>- Are you mad?
- Possibly.</b>
<b>Ta-da!</b>
<b>We must strike now.</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>Asgard is meaningless.</b>
<b>The Aether has found its way home.</b>
<b>What I could do with the power
that flows through those veins.</b>
<b>It would consume you.</b>
<b>She's holding up all right.</b>
<b>For now.</b>
<b>She's strong in ways
you'd never even know.</b>
<b>Say goodbye.</b>
<b>Not this day.</b>
<b>This day, the next,
a hundred years, it's nothing.</b>
<b>It's a heartbeat.</b>
<b>You'll never be ready.</b>
<b>The only woman
whose love you've prized</b>
<b>will be snatched from you.</b>
<b>And will that satisfy you?</b>
<b>Satisfaction is not
in my nature.</b>
<b>Surrender is not in mine.</b>
<b>- The son of Odin...
- No.</b>
<b>Not just of Odin.</b>
<b>You think you alone
were loved of Mother?</b>
<b>You had her tricks,
but I had her trust.</b>
<b>Trust?</b>
<b>Was that her last expression?</b>
<b>Trust?
When you let her die?</b>
<b>- What help were you in your cell?
- Who put me there?</b>
<b>Who put me there?</b>
<b>You know damn well!</b>
<b>You know damn well who!</b>
<b>She wouldn't want us to fight.</b>
<b>Well, she wouldn't
exactly be shocked.</b>
<b>I wish I could trust you.</b>
<b>Trust my rage.</b>
<b>You'll have to sign for your
father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>Oh, yeah.</b>
<b>My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.</b>
<b>One man's leather wallet, brown.</b>
<b>One key ring, three keys.</b>
<b>Prescription medicine...</b>
<b>Various.</b>
<b>- And...
- Erik.</b>
<b>- These.
- Yeah.</b>
<b>Those.</b>
<b>Thank goodness.</b>
<b>Erik.</b>
<b>Yes?</b>
<b>It's, uh, Darcy.</b>
<b>Darcy.</b>
<b>So good to see you.</b>
<b>Oh, I missed you, too.</b>
<b>How did you find me?</b>
<b>You were naked on TV.</b>
<b>Okay, time to go, lots to do.</b>
<b>Getting weird now.</b>
<b>I should not be left in
charge of stuff like this.</b>
<b>I don't get paid enough.
I don't get paid, period.</b>
<b>I'm Ian by the way,
uh, Darcy's intern.</b>
<b>Yeah, I don't get paid either.</b>
<b>Are you all right?</b>
<b>I've had a god in my brain.</b>
<b>I don't recommend it.</b>
<b>Dr. Selvig, sir,
your gear is beeping at me.</b>
<b>It's happening.
It's sooner than I calculated.</b>
<b>Wait. What's happening?</b>
<b>Birds?</b>
<b>Birds are happening?</b>
<b>They're starlings.
It's called a murmuration.</b>
<b>My dad, he used to take me
bird watching as a kid.</b>
<b>- Nerd.
- Look!</b>
<b>Where did they go?</b>
<b>What the hell was that?</b>
<b>Why are you smiling?</b>
<b>There's nothing more reassuring</b>
<b>than realizing that the world
is crazier than you are.</b>
<b>Take me to Jane's lab.</b>
<b>Jane.</b>
<b>Malekith.</b>
<b>All right. Are you ready?</b>
<b>I am.</b>
<b>You know, this plan of yours
is going to get us killed.</b>
<b>Yes, possibly.</b>
<b>You still don't trust me, brother?</b>
<b>Would you?</b>
<b>No, I wouldn't.</b>
<b>Thor!</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>You really think I
cared about Frigga?</b>
<b>About any of you?</b>
<b>All I ever wanted</b>
<b>was you and Odin</b>
<b>dead at my feet!</b>
<b>Malekith!</b>
<b>I am Loki of Jotunheim,</b>
<b>and I bring you a gift.</b>
<b>I ask only one thing in return...</b>
<b>A good seat from which</b>
<b>to watch Asgard burn.</b>
<b>He is an enemy of Asgard.</b>
<b>He was a prisoner in their dungeons.</b>
<b>Look at me.</b>
<b>Loki! Now!</b>
<b>Ah!</b>
<b>Ah!</b>
<b>- Ah!
- No!</b>
<b>See you in hell, monster.</b>
<b>No. No, no, no.</b>
<b>Oh, you fool, you didn't listen.</b>
<b>I know...</b>
<b>I'm a fool, I'm a fool.</b>
<b>Stay with me, okay?</b>
<b>I'm sorry.</b>
<b>- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Shh...</b>
<b>It's okay.</b>
<b>It's all right.</b>
<b>I'll tell Father what
you did here today.</b>
<b>I didn't do it for him.</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>He's going to unleash it.</b>
<b>Not just on Asgard, or on a star.
Malekith is going to destroy everything.</b>
<b>How?</b>
<b>Jane, how?</b>
<b>I saw him on Earth.
Why would he go to Earth?</b>
<b>The Convergence.</b>
<b>Oh, God.</b>
<b>None of this would have happened
if I hadn't found the Aether.</b>
<b>Then Malekith would've
only possessed it</b>
<b>that much sooner.</b>
<b>I only found it because
I was looking for you.</b>
<b>Jane...</b>
<b>Now we're trapped here.</b>
<b>It's not me.</b>
<b>Hello?</b>
<b>Hi, Jane, it's Richard.</b>
<b>Richard? Where are you?</b>
<b>I'm still at the office.</b>
<b>It's been a crazy day here today.</b>
<b>- Oh, my God, this is amazing.
- Is it?</b>
<b>I quite enjoyed our lunch</b>
<b>despite never actually
ordering anything.</b>
<b>How am I getting service here?</b>
<b>Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to try you later?</b>
<b>No, no, no. Please, whatever
you do, do not hang up the phone.</b>
<b>Okay, then.</b>
<b>I was just wondering
if you want to try again.</b>
<b>Uh, maybe dinner next time.</b>
<b>Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</b>
<b>- Just stay on the phone, okay?
- Yeah, I will.</b>
<b>Oh, my God.</b>
<b>Am I interrupting something?</b>
<b>No, no, no. Nothing at all.</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>I'm losing you there.
Are you in a tunnel?</b>
<b>Where are we going?</b>
<b>Hello?</b>
<b>Why are there so
many shoes in here?</b>
<b>I'll just text her.</b>
<b>So, who's Richard?</b>
<b>Really?</b>
<b>- Jane!
- Hey.</b>
<b>You can't just leave like that.</b>
<b>The whole world is going crazy.</b>
<b>All the stuff we saw is spreading.</b>
<b>- Did you go to a party?
- Erik?</b>
<b>Jane! How wonderful.</b>
<b>Oh!</b>
<b>- You've been to Asgard.
- Where are your pants?</b>
<b>Oh, he, uh...
He says it helps him think.</b>
<b>Okay, well, I'm going to need
everything you got on this.</b>
<b>All the work you've been doing on
gravimetric anomalies, everything.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Are you well, Erik?</b>
<b>Your brother's not coming, is he?</b>
<b>Loki is dead.</b>
<b>Oh, thank God!</b>
<b>I... I meant, I'm so sorry.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>Forgive me, my liege.</b>
<b>I've returned from
the Dark World with news.</b>
<b>Thor?</b>
<b>There was no sign of Thor,
or the weapon, but...</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>We found a body.</b>
<b>Loki.</b>
<b>Malekith is going to
fire the Aether at a spot</b>
<b>where all the nine worlds
are connecting.</b>
<b>Amplifying the weapon's impact.</b>
<b>For each additional world,</b>
<b>the power will increase
exponentially.</b>
<b>The effect would be universal.</b>
<b>But the Alignment is only temporary.</b>
<b>He must be in exactly the right
place at the right time.</b>
<b>Well, how do we know where that is?</b>
<b>We follow the directions.</b>
<b>This has happened before</b>
<b>thousands of years ago, and the
Ancients were there to see it.</b>
<b>All the great constructions,</b>
<b>the Mayans, the Chinese,
the Egyptians.</b>
<b>They made use of the gravitational
effects of the Convergence.</b>
<b>And they left us a map.</b>
<b>Stonehenge,</b>
<b>Snowdon,</b>
<b>the Great Orme.</b>
<b>These are all coordinates
taking us...</b>
<b>Here.</b>
<b>Greenwich?</b>
<b>The walls between worlds
will be almost non-existent.</b>
<b>Physics is going to go ballistic.</b>
<b>Increases and decreases in gravity,</b>
<b>spatial extrusions.</b>
<b>The very fabric of reality
is going to be torn apart.</b>
<b>I better get my pants.</b>
<b>Focus!
This is important.</b>
<b>We have to hammer them in
all around the site</b>
<b>and then Jane and Erik will
activate them from the tower.</b>
<b>They're taped together.</b>
<b>Do you even know
what these things do?</b>
<b>Uh... No.</b>
<b>Neither do I.</b>
<b>Shh!</b>
<b>- Come on, come on, come on!
- Right.</b>
<b>Holy...</b>
<b>Shit.</b>
<b>Ah!</b>
<b>You needn't have come
so far, Asgardian.</b>
<b>Death would've come to you
soon enough.</b>
<b>Not by your hand.</b>
<b>Your universe was never meant to be.</b>
<b>Your world and your family</b>
<b>will be extinguished!</b>
<b>We're running out of time.</b>
<b>- Almost there.
- Are you sure this is going to work?</b>
<b>These devices were made to detect
anomalies, not cause them.</b>
<b>Oh, come on.</b>
<b>Come on, Darcy.</b>
<b>You know, with all that power,</b>
<b>I thought you'd hit harder.</b>
<b>Done.</b>
<b>The Convergence will be in
full effect in seven minutes.</b>
<b>That just means we have to
keep Malekith busy for eight.</b>
<b>Okay, you might want to
hold on to something.</b>
<b>That is awesome!</b>
<b>How did you do that?</b>
<b>Well, the gravitational fields</b>
<b>interact with the weak spots
between worlds, creating...</b>
<b>Ooh, get the guy with the sword!</b>
<b>- Oops.
- Let's go.</b>
<b>Um...</b>
<b>What the hell just happened?</b>
<b>Move!</b>
<b>What are you all doing?</b>
<b>You need to get out of here, now!</b>
<b>You're joking, right?</b>
<b>That's Thor out there.</b>
<b>He's waving his hammer
around and everything!</b>
<b>Ah!</b>
<b>Confirming ship is hostile.</b>
<b>Confirmed, ship is hostile.</b>
<b>You have permission to engage.</b>
<b>Roger.</b>
<b>Missiles locked.</b>
<b>Missiles away.</b>
<b>Missiles off target.</b>
<b>I repeat, target missed.
I'm losing control.</b>
<b>Mayday! Mayday!
Lost positive control.</b>
<b>What are you doing?</b>
<b>My signal's not connecting.</b>
<b>Jane!</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>Are you all right?</b>
<b>You saved my life.</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>I guess I did.</b>
<b>Mmm.</b>
<b>Darcy?</b>
<b>Jane!</b>
<b>- Ian!
- Selvig!</b>
<b>Mew mew!</b>
<b>Mind the gap.</b>
<b>How do I get to Greenwich?</b>
<b>Take this train.
Three stops.</b>
<b>Mind the gap.</b>
<b>Sorry. Sorry.</b>
<b>- We're out of time.
- Jane.</b>
<b>Jane!</b>
<b>Thor!</b>
<b>We're too late.</b>
<b>The Convergence is at its peak.</b>
<b>Can those things stop him?</b>
<b>Not from here.</b>
<b>We can't get close enough.</b>
<b>Loan.</b>
<b>Malekith!</b>
<b>Darkness returns, Asgardian.</b>
<b>Have you come to witness
the end of your universe?</b>
<b>I've come to accept your surrender.</b>
<b>You think you can stop this?</b>
<b>The Aether cannot be destroyed.</b>
<b>But you can.</b>
<b>Thor! No.</b>
<b>Jane!</b>
<b>Ah!</b>
<b>Everybody okay?</b>
<b>He's gonna come back.</b>
<b>Except, you know,</b>
<b>last time he was gone for,
like, two years.</b>
<b>Well, it's only been two days, so...</b>
<b>Did he say anything before he left?</b>
<b>Yeah, he had to figure some
stuff out with his father.</b>
<b>He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.</b>
<b>Oh.</b>
<b>You once said there would
never be a wiser king than me.</b>
<b>You were wrong.</b>
<b>The Alignment has brought
all the realms together.</b>
<b>Every one of them saw you
offer your life to save them.</b>
<b>What can Asgard offer
its new king in return?</b>
<b>My life.</b>
<b>Father, I cannot be king of Asgard.</b>
<b>I will protect Asgard and all the
realms with my last and every breath,</b>
<b>but I cannot do so from that chair.</b>
<b>Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.</b>
<b>The brutality, the sacrifice...</b>
<b>it changes you.</b>
<b>I'd rather be a good man
than a great king.</b>
<b>Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?</b>
<b>When you speak,
do I never hear Mother's voice?</b>
<b>This is not for Jane, Father.</b>
<b>She does not know
what I came here to say.</b>
<b>Now, forbid me to see her,
or say she can rule at my side.</b>
<b>It changes nothing.</b>
<b>One son who wanted
the throne too much,</b>
<b>another who will not take it.</b>
<b>Is this my legacy?</b>
<b>Loki died with honor.</b>
<b>I shall try to live the same.</b>
<b>Is that not legacy enough?</b>
<b>It belongs to you.</b>
<b>If you are worthy of it.</b>
<b>I shall try to be.</b>
<b>I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.</b>
<b>I know.</b>
<b>If I were proud of the man
my son had become,</b>
<b>even that, I could not say.</b>
<b>It would speak only from my heart.</b>
<b>Go.</b>
<b>My son.</b>
<b>Thank you, Father.</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>I present to you,</b>
<b>Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.</b>
<b>Whoa...</b>
<b>Asgardians, it's an honor.</b>
<b>You know why we're here.</b>
<b>Of course.</b>
<b>But, if I may ask,</b>
<b>why not keep it secure
in your own vault?</b>
<b>The Tesseract is
already on Asgard.</b>
<b>It is not wise to keep two
Infinity Stones so close together.</b>
<b>That's very wise.</b>
<b>I can assure you,</b>
<b>it will be absolutely safe here,</b>
<b>in my collection.</b>
<b>See that it is.</b>
<b>One down.</b>
<b>Five to go.</b>
