I swear!
Goddamn it!
Oh, no!
- So who do you think is the enemy?
- No, no, give me a specific answer.
- You are the goddamn enemy, Capa.
You and this whole tower of psychobabble.
You know what I hope? That God gets real pissed off...
and He shrivels up your cock
so that it points straight down to
hell, where you belong!
Okay, Michelle.
Before you become His avenging angel
and swoop down to finish me off.
Now I finally get it.
You are like my ex-husband.
You think that everything's gotta be either black or white 'cause you gone color-blind.
But God's on my side now.
He knows I'm not like you.
Well, we're all pretty much the same, Michelle. We all do it.
We all do what?
Tend to view our lives as if
we're looking through a keyhole.
It's a very limited view of the truth.
So we have to fill in the blanks.
- We invent things. I don't know what you mean.
You invent enemies to test your strength against.
You invent gods to protect you from these enemies.
What a depressing view of life you have!
- That is such horseshit!
- Who is the enemy?
One minute you have friends. The next moment, they've slipped away.
You leave here and I wonder, "Who's Michelle hating this week?"
I try to remember, and I can't.
Can't bring 'em to mind. Do you know why?
- No. Why don't you tell me? Take a look in the mirror, Michelle.
Which mirror? This mirror?
Any mirror. Tell me what you see.
I see...
your reflection over my shoulder.
-  I see...
there's nothin' much that I really like.
I think I prefer the view outside, actually.
Michelle!
Michelle!
- All right, get back there.
- Stay back.
Get back in your car!
Stop it.
Michelle.
Oh, my God.
It was the reddest blood I ever saw, pooled around her green dress.
And then the red disappeared.
Christ, Ed. It was like a vibration of color...
broadcast from hell.
And then the red started to fade away.
Poor Capa. You here for me to pity you?
Hell, yes. Doesn't take Sigmund Freud...
to figure out that I don't care to see the color of my patient's blood.
I'm a little surprised that this happened to you.
Sure. You always thought I was a coldhearted son-of-a-bitch.
Not really, but there is a kind of arrogance here.
Do you really believe that you are responsible for her illness?
You were a small, recent part of her life.
Yeah, that's right. That's right.
Well, it's all too fucking glib for me, Larry.
I cannot dispose of this woman that easily.
Well, you always were a romantic.
- Are you involved with anyone else?
- No.
But I'm still a romantic.
I just don't have anybody to be romantic with.
They all want to fuck me or marry me.
- None of 'em want to love me.
- Maybe you don't want to be loved.
- You had a happy marriage once.
She loved me to death.
- And then she ran off and loved somebody else to death. Of course...
there's something else here.
To deny red is to deny emotion.
- Oh, yeah. As you know, that can be very dangerous.
Yes, yes, I know.
Very dangerous.
I know...
that I've got something broken.
- And I know that it's gonna take some time to get it fixed. You're a pretty good therapist.
How long does it take a man like you to forgive himself?
I'll see you when I get back from Los Angeles.
Don't run away because of one treatment failure.
I'm not running away, Larry. It's just a little trip to Los Angeles.
Besides, I can't really run away.
It's all up here, isn't it? Pow.
It's a package deal. The head goes with me.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Los Angeles.
Please remain seated until the aircraft comes--
Just another Monday in paradise.
There's a fender bender on the 405, slowing things down--
Hey, jerk-off, what are you looking at?
See that? There's accident. Hey, what happened?
- Anybody's hurt? Huh? Anybody's dead?
What are you doing? You are looking there and driving here?
Put the pedal on the metal! Asshole!
- Is the aquarium with it? That's a blue shark.
-Okay.
Thirty-three and three is--
Was that an aftershock I felt?
Forty-four, forty-five.
- Five. Thirty-eight. Fourteen.
- Thirty-three. Two.
- Thirteen. - Three.
- Twenty-nine. Three hundred and four. Casey, you're such a weenie.
- Leave him alone, will you? Seven.
- Eight. Clark.
- Yeah. Did you read the paper today?
- No. I was just wondering how many fuckin' pages it had.
- Oh, Christ, I fell right into that. Sixteen.
- Four. Forty-seven. I care that he's late.
- I don't get it. I do too. Why not?
Because his father's paying for his therapy.
My dead husband's paying for mine, and I still care.
Aww, unbelievable.
I think we should get started now. Clark?
- Hey, Bob! God. Bill.
- Hey. How you doin'? You look great.
- I'm good. Good, yeah.
I'm sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic on the freeway.
- We're just about to get started. I'll wait out here for you.
- Why don't you join us? You know, this is the lastthing I need right now--
- I'm serious.I could use a second opinion. Come on. No, look, Bob--
This is my friend and colleague, Bill Capa, from New York. Why don't you sit over there, Bill?
I thought it might be interesting for you and for him...
if he sat in on one of our sessions.
What kind of a shrink are you?
I'm a behaviorist.
- Qualifications?
- Same as Bob.We went to college together.
Then we fought the battle of Penn State Mental Hospital as interns.
- No one's going to be offended if you want to say no.
- No, Bob.
- Nobod-- Nobody wants to say no.
- Oh, Jesus.
- I'm Sondra. How are you, Bill?
- Fine, thank you, Sondra.
- Medical degree?
- No. I'm a psychologist...
and a psychoanalyst, not a psychiatrist.
The Ph.D. is from NYU.
- Okay, thank you.
- That's fine. So it's Bill and Bob. Therapy a deux.
- Really. Why don't we begin...
by introducing ourselves and then saying as much or as little about why we're here...
- as we're comfortable with.
- Name's Buck.
- Oh, that's helpful. Very macho of you.
That's an anti-gender remark.
Sondra? Sondra, why don't you start us off?
Okay.
Um--
My name is Sondra Dorio.
And, uh...
I always marry older men, but...
I'm single now...
...and I keep, uh--Well, I--
I want sex all the time.
But I mean, I really do...
want a real relationship.
And, um, sometimes...
I-I steal things.
I mean, they're little things.
Doesn't make any sense. It's hard to --You know, I-- Is that okay?
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Richie? This will be an event.
Richie!
What?
Would you like to tell Bill a little something about yourself?
No.
Okay. Nobody else is going to do it. I will.
Richie has a gender identity problem...
and a social phobia...
- and he's promised the group not
to wear the Walkman in group -- Thank you, Dr. Clark.
- To lay the inventory on.
- Oh, St. Christopher rattles his chains.
- St. Michael, sir.
- This is not about you!
You're right. You know what I'm saying?
I-I-I'll open my-my mouth....
to talk...
b-but nothing h-happens.
Except for when I--when I do drugs.
I-I c-can't talk...
so that's... how come I'm here.
Th-They say that I-I--
That I blush too.
Y-You c-can say that again.
Fuck you!
Fuck! Fuck you!
I'll tear your fuckin' head off!
- You fuckin' cocksucker! Get up!
Get the fuck off me!
- Buck.
- Richie!
It's all right. He'll come back.
- What do you think, Dr. Clark? Was it something I said?
- You are an asshole.
- You know, guys, a little humanity.
- Funny. Oh, fuckin' laugh.
We're entertaining the shit out of you, aren't we?
Stop being responsible for everyone.
- Why don't you stop wound-licking, Sondra?
- That's very nice.
Buck.
I lost my wife and daughter.
And I just can't seem to get past it. All right?
I'm very sorry. How did they die?
They say--
I-- I can't talk about it.
Casey?
I am Casey Heinz.
I am a painter. I live in a loft, downtown.
And I guess you could say...
I'm alienated.
- Can't you ever be serious?
Does a bear poop in the woods?
Sit next to Clark.
And then smoke up a storm?
My name is Clark.
I'm a lawyer.
And, uh...
I'm an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
So what's the problem?
The problem is that if you and Buck
are going to smoke in here...
then the door to Dr. Moore's office
must remain open a minimum of 15 inches.
I can't stand the smoke, okay?
And I would also like to suggest
that you buy one of those ashtrays...
that sucks up the smoke
and purifies 'em.
- How come you don't do anything about this, Bob?
- They cost $9.99...
half of which is $4.99-point-5.
- He's gonna open the door. One of you will pay an extra penny.
- You can work that out.
- He's gonna open the door.
- I'm gonna open the door.
You smell like an ashtray.
You know, if you don't act more serious in group--
- Hi, Richie.
- He's back.
- He's back.
- Next time you get snot on the doorknob--
- Come sit down here.
- Bill.
What would you like to tell us about yourself?
Well...
I have plenty of problems...
the biggest of which right now is jetlag, so I think I'll pass for now, Bob.
Fair enough.
She's like a daughter to me.
We hang out. Um--
It's wonderful.
Well, that's all for tonight.
I'll see you all next week.
Way to go.
Uh, Bill, I'll be with you
in a couple of minutes, okay?
- Bye.
- Coffee, anyone?
- Yeah.
-  Nine.
- Have you read Bob's book?
- No, I haven't.
It's really--It's quite excellent.
"Way To Go."
- I'm glad to hear you liked it.
- Very much.
- Good.
- Good night, Dr. Capa.
Good night.
- Alone at last.
- You okay?
Well, nobody jumped out the window,
so maybe I'm makin' progress.
- Wanna get a drink?
- Uh-huh.
Wanna go get laid?
No.
So what do you think of my little group?
- What's Buck's story?
- You mean how did he lose his wife and kid?
I don't know yet. He's not talkin' yet. Either.
- What about Casey?
- You tell me.
Well, I smell money. Lots of it.
Maybe an abusive father. How am I doin' so far?
- A+.
- Daddy pays for the expensive loft downtown...
and the very expensive artistic lifestyle
as long as Junior stays in therapy.
The hair on the back
of my neck's standin' up.
Yeah, I'm a psychic
when it comes to masochists.
- Five'll get you ten. He likes to whack now and then.
- Where do you get that from?
Ah, I was born with it.
I'm like a tuning fork.
- What about Richie?
- Genuine nut case.
- Dangerous?
- Volatile.
- Don't fuck with a trapped rat.
- Oh, I see.
Trapped rat syndrome with a recommendation
of a non-fuck-with therapy?
- Can I quote ya on that?
- Yes, you may.
- Just take notes. There'll be a pop quiz later.
- Okay, I'm ready.
All right, if I diagnose
a schizophrenia, what do you recommend?
- Don't fuck with it.
- Now you got it.
Oh, man.
This all one place?
Goddamn.
Like peekin' through a keyhole.
You get a very limited view of the truth.
What's that?
Way To Go must have gone really well.
- Yeah.
- After you, wise guy.
- Come on. Oh-ho-ho. Oh, man.
So, how are we as we approach 40?
We're in, uh, good shape.
Really good shape.
We, uh, finally got divorced.
We have some money. We're meticulous.
- I don't detect a woman's touch.
- We have a little friend.
Oh.
You'll meet her.
- She's too young for ya.
- Oh!
Always guess the cliche, and you won't be disappointed.
This womanvis not a cliche.
Thanks.
- Good to see you, Bob.
- You too.
So, uh, you ready yet?
Ready to what?
It's a hard thing to talk about.
So hard to talk about.
It's just a game.
A dumb, deceitful game.
That's why I quit my practice.
Lost your religion, huh?
Well, I've certainly lost
my belief in the scriptures.
I'm sorry, buddy. You gotta be in a lot of pain.
There is a distinct absence of pain.
I can--
I cannot feel the pain that I know
I am supposed to be feeling right now.
And I think I'm goin' crazy.
I've lost it, man.
I think that I am goin' crazy.
You may be.
Your mind may be shot,
but I hope your body isn't.
- Do I get to warm up?
- Yeah.
Two miles any pace you like
and then, uh, let's do ten.
- Ten?
- Too much for ya, huh?
Nah. Not enough.
- I was thinkin' of maybe 20.
- Geez, Bill, you never change.
Why don't we just drop our pants
and see who's got the bigger dick?
- Then we can go back and have a nice, civilized breakfast.
- Wouldn't be civilized.
- Why?
- You'd be sulkin'.
Ahh.
- They don't have hills in New York.
- Hang on a second.
- Huh? What?
- Hang on a second.
Hang on a second here.
What was that?
What the hell was that?
- What are you afraid of?
- I think I got a gear slippin' here or somethin'.
That's not what I meant.
What's with the security system,
the security gates, lookin' over your shoulder?
- I been gettin' some threats.
- You mean death threats?
Pretty sure it's somebody
in the Monday night group.
- I just don't know who.
- Monday night as in last night?
Yeah.
I was hopin' maybe with your tuning fork
that you might have a hunch.
No. No hunches, Bob.
What makes you think
it's somebody in the group?
Only about a dozen things.
It's been going on for a couple of months now.
It's funny how it
gets to you after a while.
- You call the cops?
- Yeah.
They said if they had to protect every
shrink in L.A., they'd need an army.
But that I should call 'em
if, uh, anything happens.
Yeah. That makes sense.
Yeah. It'll probably all just blow over.
- Yeah.
- How 'bout you?
How 'bout me what?
What do you give a suicidal patient
who's got everything?
- A parachute. I heard it already.
- Out here already, huh?
Come on, old-timer.
Oh... shit.
- You may have to--You may have to carry me in.
You know, you lose a lot more gracefully than you used to.
Yeah, well, you know,
practice and all.
Hey, how 'bout that?
Learning To Lose, by Dr. Bill Capa.
- Got a ring to it.
They're makin' them seats
a little smaller, huh? Whoo!
I'll see you next week, all right?
I'm goin' now. You want me
to lock up on the way out?
That'd be great, Barbara.
Just relax.
Barbara?
No! No-o-o-o!
Why?
- Have you thought about
- Man, I didn't do nothing.
-Oh, please? You know, you're very cute.
- Yeah, I love you too.
Relax.
- You Capa?
- Yes, I'm Bill Capa.
You're here because
of the dead doctor?
Yes.
Um, I read something
about sessions on Mondays?
Tell me about this Monday group.
There's five patients in the group.
- I can't really remember their names right now.
- Like five cuckoos?
No. Four neurotics
of varying degrees...
and one killer.
At least that's what Bob thought.
- Bob Moore?
- Good. Yes, Bob Moore.
- Uh, four men and one woman.
- Right.
And you sat in on
one of these sessions, right?
Yes, I did.
- So who did it?
- Hey, hey, hey!
Anderson! This is civilization, man!
What do you think this is,
your bedroom? Damn!
Knock! Knock! Don't come in
to my office like that, bro. Hey!
Whew.
It's a Third World thing.
-Where were we?
- You were probing me about the patients.
I was about to tell you that
I really can't help you. I don't know these people.
But you're a professional, like me.
You gotta have some kind of suspicion.
I really don't have a clue.
I'd like to help you.
Even if I could, there's
an issue of confidentiality.
- Confidentiality?
- Yes.
You're talkin' to me
about an issue of confidentiality?
Similar to the Miranda oath.
If a friend of mine got killed...
and the only thing between
the killer and me was Miranda...
you know what I would do?
I'd fuck Miranda up the ass, okay?
But don't tell anybody, because
it's a matter of confidentiality. Shh.
Look, I'm sorry.
I can't help ya. I've only been
in Los Angeles four days.
You're sleeping in that...
dead guy's house, aren't you?
- Yes.
- Maybe something will come to you in the night.
You know, like dreams and shit.
What happens to patients in a situation like this?
Usually a colleague will offer to take
over the group, continue the treatment.
How sweet. How sweet.
It's like one of the vultures dies...
and then the others step in line
and eat his portion?
Is that what you're planning?
- No.
- Why not?
- 'Cause I really can't handle that right now.
- Sure you can!
Come on. You've been a week in L.A.
You already have your own private squirrel farm.
How bad can that be?
That's a great career move.
Where were you at the time
of the killing, Capa?
I was at his house--at Bob's house.
You had to think about that?
Jesus Christ. You gonna arrest me, Lieutenant Martinez?
- You want a lawyer?
- Do I need a lawyer?
You're in L.A.
Everybody needs a lawyer.
Ay.
You can go home now. Take a shower.
And keep your mouth shut.
The only thing I got goin' for me
is that few people know what happened.
I don't want the press
fucking things up.
- All right, all right.
- Hold on.
Oh, shit.
- Capa? Capa, are you there?
- Yeah.
- How's it going?
- What do you want?
I brought the victim's car back,
and I gotta search the house.
You got a search warrant?
What is it with you? Don't you want
me to find out who killed your friend?
- No, I don't have a warrant.
- All right, come on in.
- Open the gate.
- Yeah, right.
- How's that?
You got the sprinklers on.
How 'bout that?
Jill. His wife.
- His ex-wife.
- Nice bush.
I'll tell her
you said so.
I'm sure it'll mean a lot to her.
Check this fucking bed.
Damn.
Everybody's having fun
but me, goddamn it.
- I do not like guns.
- You prefer knives?
- I need you to do me a favor.
- What's that?
- I want you to tell the
group about Moore's death.
- Me?
- Yes.
- Why?
Well, maybe one of them
won't come in.
Or maybe they would all come in, but then
you would be able to spot something wrong.
- I can't handle it right now.
- I just had all the mess in his office cleaned up.
Don't you want to help me
find the killer? Have a heart.
- What does that mean?
- If you don't tell 'em, I'll have to tell 'em.
Am I the person to break
the news to these people?
"Listen up, you fuckin' daffodils.
Your shrink is dead.
Which means that all the time, effort and love you put in
this relationship is wasted.
You're gonna remain as fucked up
as you are, or get worse."
You are one sinister
piece of work.
All right. I'll do it.
It's better if you do it.
No, you listen to me.
You don't understand, Gene.
Don't lie. Just give
the family what it wants.
No. No, you don't understand.
- What--?
I have to call ya back.
Christ.
Hey, you all right?
Hey.
Why me?
Hi. I'm Rose.
Hi, Rose. Nice of you
to run into me like this.
I'm Bill Capa.
I got no insurance.
I know it's against the law
and everything.
Don't bust my chops.
I'll bring the money to you, if you
could just get an estimate, okay?
- Why don't you give me a break, huh?
- Got a pen?
Yeah.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Oh. Poor old brain
can't remember its own phone number?
I just moved here.
- Oh.
- From New York.
I wrote my address down
'cause I'm not sure about this number.
I don't know how long
I'm gonna be there...
so maybe you can call me sometime
over the next couple of days.
- I will.
- Bye.
Hey, uh, don't you
want my address?
You could lie.
Hi.
- Who hasn't arrived yet?
- Sondra.
- Where's Bob?
- W-What's wrong?
If it's all right,
I'd rather wait till we're all here.
- She always this late?
- Depends on who is banging her.
I'm sorry.
Class was really, really, really late.
What class is that? Advanced
cunnilingus for the single woman...
or C.P.R. for
pleasure and gain?
- Oh, Christ.
- Don't excite her. Where's Dr. Moore?
- There's something that I want to tell you.
- What?
Well, what's the matter?
- Yeah?
- Well, I--
I'm tryin' to pay attention. Shh!
You should prepare yourselves
for bad news.
Why? Uh-oh.
Bob's been killed.
- What are you saying?
- What are you telling me?
- He was murdered.
-- He was locking up here
late Friday night.
- Here?
- Yes, right here in the office.
Was he shot, stabbed, beaten?
Have they got a suspect? A motive?
Three days go by
and you don't call us?
- I thought it'd be easier if you heard it together.
- Oh, I see.
So even Bob's death
is group therapy. That's great.
Hey, Bob, thanks for giving us
a chance to grieve together. Shit!
- What the fuck is going on? I need to know more!
- He was stabbed to death.
- How many times was he stabbed?
- This man was Bob's best friend!
- Do you really need exact numbers now?
- Sondra!
- Get your fucking hands off me.
- It's okay. It's okay.
- It doesn't make sense to me!
- Many times, Clark.
More than 30.
That's all I can tell you.
It wasn't a thief.
I'll tell you that right now.
- I agree.
- Why stab a guy 30 times?
Bob-- He'd piss in his pants if
you showed him a knife. You know that.
- What are you saying?
- I am saying, Sondra...
that you really have to hate a person
to stab him that many times!
You're a shrink, right? You know what kind of power
people hand over to shrinks.
Well, maybe sometimes they hand over
more than they want to.
That is absolutely correct.
A thief would not stick around
to stab someone 30 times.
Since when did you become
such an expert on robbery?
It's not the robbery
he's an expert on. It's the rage.
W-What are we gonna do now?
I-I mean us.
- Th-The group.
- I bet Dr. Capa has an idea.
What does he mean?
I think Casey
is suggesting that l...
may have some plan
to replace Bob.
- Maybe you should.
- No, I can't do that. Not right now.
- Why?
- Why not? For one reason or another...
I'm more screwed up
than you people are.
I was just being
obnoxious and loud before.
- Anybody have a fuckin' Xanax?
- I have a Librium.
- Stop with the drugs.
- It would be a good idea if you stayed.
- Body isn't cold yet.
- There'd be some connection.
You were Bob's best friend.
You-- You seem
kind of like him.
It'd be so much easier
to trust you.
I know what kind of a force
group can become in your lives.
You... tell things here.
Intimate things that you wouldn't
tell your best friend.
I'm very flattered
that you would, uh--
But the truth is, you are
the people that make this work.
I will be more than happy to try
and find someone for you to
continue this, but I cannot--
Does my opinion
count for anything?
I would like to ask...
why it is you feel
so inadequate for the task.
Maybe he just
don't like us.
- No, that's not it, Buck.
- Shh!
Why don't you step on something?
Six weeks ago, I spoke
harshly to a patient...
and she committed suicide.
Right in front of me.
Perhaps she would have done this anyway.
That's what my colleagues say.
But I don't know.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
And my patient--
her name was Michelle--
jumped out of a wi--window in my office.
- Oh.
- So much blood.
So red, and I--
And right, uh, before my eyes...
the red, uh, disappeared.
Just turned to gray, and so
I don't see... red now.
But, see, I was her doctor.
And I failed.
So I can't help you.
I don't think that you want someone
like me around right now.
I think I do.
Me too.
Why don't you give us
a try for a month?
Listen, if you need any--
any free legal advice...
you know, to help
wrap up Bob's affairs...
please don't hesitate
to call me.
I'm not with anyone right now,
and I would be more than happy
to help you in any way.
Thank you.
- You bring me a confession?
- Nope.
Well, you win some,
you lose some, huh, Capa?
Listen, maybe it wasn't
one of the group.
Oh, no! He's beginning
to like 'em already!
Your friend Bob Moore deserves
a lot more loyalty than this.
Hey, what is-- What are we sitting here
shouting at each other for?
- What is with this place?
I used to work in Narcotics,
and I used to come here a lot.
I probably fucked
and/or arrested...
half of these people's parents.
- It's a nice place. I like it.
- Makes sense.
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't have anything for ya.
I'll see ya around.
- So that's it, huh?
- Yep.
Anything you wanna tell me?
- No.
- Yeah, it's a four-door, man.
- Well, you better shut the group down.
- Who said I hadn't?
Well, have you
or haven't you?
They asked me to take over the group,
and I couldn't say no.
I figured.
You're gonna do real well
in this town.
- Shut the fucker down.
- What's the problem? You sent me over there.
No, I sent you there
to convey a piece of bad news.
- Oh, give me a break, would ya, man?
- I didn't send you there...
to go trolling for business.
- Aw, come on.
- You told me you couldn't handle it.
Well, it turns out
that I can handle it.
You stick your dick
in a barrel of barracudas
once, maybe you won't lose it.
You leave it in there,
it's gonna get chewed off at the root.
Appreciate your concern
for my dick, Hector. Thank you.
I'm bein' really nice
out of concern for your safety.
In case it's one of them, huh?
Shut it down, okay?
- No, can't do that.
- Shut it down, chingada!
Don't be an asshole! Find another
fucking set of wombats to exploit!
These sudden irrational
outbursts, Hector--
did they begin in childhood
or in puberty?
- Get outta my face!
- Am I in your face?
An interesting choice of words.
Would you like me in your face?
You married, Hector?
If you ever want to deal
with any of these problems,
I'll give you a special rate.
Special rate?
What, like frequent flyer miles?
Let me ask you something.
Are you really color-blind...
or is that some shit you feed them
so they feel sorry for you?
No, unfortunately,
I am color--
- You bugged the office.
- You know, for a shrink,you're pretty fucking dense.
Whoa!
Hello.
- Who's there?
- Hi.
Remember me?
Miss Fender Bender?
There she is--
a little angel dancing
on the head of a pin.
So, did you get
that estimate?
No.
Wow.
Nice place you got here.
It's a little cold...
but it's kind of
tasteful, right?
Yeah. And wet.
You too, I guess.
Cold or tasteful?
So, are we eating in
or are you taking me out?
You can't? At all?
Wow. Not even
shades of pink?
Can't tell me if
it's smeared or not.
I can't tell you if
your eyes are bloodshot.
Really? That's sad.
So you know what?
ln respect for your infirmity...
I'm gonna give up
wearing lipstick.
There's something about me that
I bet you find a little strange, right?
- What is that?
- Well, I haven't asked what you do.
That's right.
You showed remarkable restraint.
Well, it's because
I'd rather guess.
You know, I actually get upset if
someone tries to tell me before I can...
figure it out
for myself, you know?
But what if I'm ashamed
of what I do?
Why? I mean, why would you
be ashamed of being a shrink?
Who told you
I was a shrink?
Well, are you?
How did you know?
- It's the way you look at me, you know?
- How do I look at you?
You have this kindness
in your eyes.
- But I think that you're
using it to keep me away.
You know, you're trying
to play it safe, trying to see me...
as a case instead of
as a female.
So you have
a tuning fork too.
I guess we have
a lot in common.
We seem to be playin'
the same game.
Why do you say
I'm playing a game?
Because you're
the fantasy girl, aren't you?
Quicksilver? The face glimpsed
across a crowded room?
Yeah, that's--
That's exactly what I am.
You'll be whatever
they want you to be--
no substance,
no rules.
Light as air.
So your feet never have to
touch those burning hot coals
the rest of us walk around on.
Yeah. Sort of like...
not seeing red?
Yeah, sort of like that.
I was afraid during dinner
that you had taken a room here...
and I might have to decide
whether or not to go up with you.
Yes, but that was part of my plan.
I mean, I wanted to. Thank you.
Oh, I need a taxi. Taxi!
No, hey, hey.
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you being
so tough for?
I'm just beginning to think
that maybe I'll--
Cab's here!
Yo, who called a taxi?
I am thinking you should just
let me take you home and
forget about this stupid taxi.
Well, I'm thinkin' you should stay
exactly where you are, 'cause...
in that condition, you'd get arrested.
Start another riot.
Give me your phone number
and address.
Why? You want to make me
fall to earth and burn my feet?
Whatever happened to quicksilver
and light as air?
She floats away
on her sweet young legs.
Waves to him once.
Drives away without
a backward glance.
- Richie is what he is.
- What exactly is that?
He was born back of a van going up
Route 5 to a Grateful Dead concert.
The first sound he ever heard
was "Beat It On Down The Line."
- Well, it could be worse.
- Not much.
- How long have you been his guardian?
- Since he was nine or ten.
But I've always
taken care of Richie.
So, what can I do for you?
Um, I was hoping
you would help me...
get Richie out of therapy.
Look, I know I'm just his
brother, but I've been like
a mother and a father to him...
and I know I can get
overprotective, but--
- Why would you want to take
Richie out of therapy now?
- What Richie needs is normalcy.
Well, normalcy--
Normalcy can be interpreted
in a lot of different ways.
Richie has practically been
raised by the state; the
social workers, psychiatrists...
forcing him into this,
um, psycho-servitude.
He is the sweetest kid you'll ever meet,
but he thinks of himself as handicapped.
It just isn't right.
Well, he's got legal problems.
Richie was sentenced by the court
to mandatory treatment.
Every kid gets into trouble.
I mean, that's why I need you
to help get him out.
You know, Dale, it's hard to tell
when someone's feeling pain...
- but I want you to know-- If Richie feels pain...
then I feel pain.
Pretty much
in tune with him.
I just wish
you'd give us a chance.
Let me check out
Richie's status.
Then, uh, I'll give
probation a call.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks, Dr. Capa.
- I really appreciate it.
- You're welcome, Dale.
You either lift weights
or work with your hands.
Yeah, uh,
I make furniture.
- Really.
- Yeah, I made this desk for Bob,
to remind him of New York.
- No kidding.
- We called it the Chrysler desk.
- Chrysler.
-  You ever see his bed?
Hi. This is Casey.
I can't get to the phone right now,
so, uh, leave a message. Thanks.
Casey, this is Bill Capa.
It's around noon.
Your father sent me a check
for the private sessions
you were having with Bob.
Should I send the check back
or do you want to continue?
Let me know, okay?
I think I want to continue.
- You bitch!
- I called you a bitch!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh!
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- Hey! You idiot!
- Hey! Hey!
Help! Shit!
Fuck!
- Hello!
I am not goin' back to New York,
you hear me? You're stuck with me!
Fuckin' bill. Great.
- Capa!
Oh, that's perfect!
That's really perfect!
Just like a cop!
You're never there when you need one!
What did I do now?
Somebody put a rattlesnake
in the mailbox, Hector!
A rattlesnake.
- You scared the shit out of me outside.
- Oh, I scared you, huh?
What the hell
are you doing here?
I could use some assistance,
some of your professional wisdom.
- I'm really flattered.
- Everyone in the group has an alibi.
Except for Casey.
He says he was alone
in his loft.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
- What does that mean?
- What do you make of Casey?
- He's a good kid.
- You're an asshole, Capa.
- Should we analyze
that statement, Hector?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on. Who is our man?
- Help me. You're the cop.
- Figure it out.
- You know what I think?
I think it was you.
You've got the look.
- That's right.
- Yeah, I been talking
to people who knew you both.
Everyone says there was a weird
competitive thing going between you.
Yeah, that's right.
There was.
I admit it.
He was on the way up...
- and I was on the way down.
- Including...
Splat! It unhinged you.
- I bet you've seen every
episode of Columbo, huh?
- Who is it?
Hi. It's me, Rose.
The old fender bender.
- That's a very young girl
to be going around...
fending benders.
Here she comes.
Weightless, hanging from the sky...
wearing a short dress
of indeterminate color.
It's red, poor thing.
Thank you.
I was thinking.
Maybe I should see a shrink.
I can recommend someone.
I feel better already.
- God, I missed you.
- This time you won't miss.
Oh! Oh, God!
- Oh!
- I want you to get dressed up.
- Get dressed up. All right.
I want to get dressed up.
- Right now?
- Uh-huh.
You're not eating.
Don't you like my food?
I'd like your food
five inches to the left.
Okay.
But if you don't
like this...
I have something else for you.
Yeah, okay.
I think it's ready.
It's a miracle.
I found it.
Here he is.
Richie Dexter.
Legal guardian: Dale Dexter.
That's his brother.
Kids were put under care,
let's see, about six years ago.
- Does it say why?
- Abandonment, abuse.
The children
were assigned to a, uh...
Dr. Niedelmeyer in Pasadena.
A child psychiatrist.
Richie was 12.
No foster parents.
Looks like the doctor retired
a couple years after that.
Then we lost track
of the kids until recently.
What do you mean,
"lost track" of them?
Like on a radar:
one minute a blip, the next, no blip.
Hey, look. This is the lost souls
memorial wing.
Children of L.A. County
in the '90s:
250,000 cases in here,
and there's two more down the hall.
Nobody's like
your ex-husband!
- That's for sure.
- That's for sure.
Okay, okay, okay.
Here it is.
- Oh, Sondra, it is so beautiful.
- Isn't it great?
I know. It's incredible.
Look at all these bags.
Oh, and that man that was
staring at you in the shop...
- was so funny.
I think I should have got it
in green or something.
- Oh. Oh!
- Lush!
What do you think?
I think...you look beautiful.
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.
- Come zip me up.
- Okay.
Okay.
Oh, this is so tight.
Thank you.
I need to find
a new husband.
- I need some more money.
- Oh, men. Who needs them?
- Have you seen my earrings anywhere?
- Oh, sweet! Yes, I've got them.
Oh, my God.
- I love these. Aren't they pretty?
- They're so gorgeous, yes.
- Try yours on.
- Okay.
What now?
- Sondra, what? I feel embarrassed.
Why?
'Cause...
the way you're looking at me.
- Sondra.
- Do men look at you like that?
- No.
Yes.
But it's different.
You know, Sondra...
it doesn't have to be
any different at all.
- You better get that.- Hello.
- Oh, h-hi. Um-- Oh---
Um, mmm, okay.
