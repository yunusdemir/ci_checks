Good evening, senator.
Good evening, Becket.
I will not be dictated to!
If I want to ride beyond the estate,
I shall do so!
I won't! I won't!
If you don't mind waiting
here for just a moment,
I'll tell my brother you're here.
Thank you, senator.
Miss Marshall,
my brother will
see you now.
Thank you,
and thanks for the lift
from the station.
Miss Marshall.
Good evening.
I believe my brother
the senator has told you
we're in mourning here.
My nephew died recently.
Yes, I know.
So I presume your business
must be very important.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
I came here because I
happened to read of his death.
Then you noticed that services
were limited only to family.
Isn't a man's widow
a member of the family?
If there is a widow, miss Marshall.
My maiden name was Sandra Marshall.
My married name is
Mrs. James Caldwell Demarest.
I am your nephew's widow.
Perhaps I'd better
postpone my condolences
until I learn a few more
of the facts.
This is
my marriage license.
Jim's papers include no copy of this.
Perhaps he had a hidden
safe deposit box.
We'll check on it.
If I hadn't seen that notice,
I would've known nothing
of my husband's death.
He would have been safely
buried before I discovered it.
Safely buried-that's a strange
expression, miss Marshall.
Mrs. Demarest.
I should prefer to be called that.
Of course,
but I'm afraid
I must insist
upon a little more proof
than this copy of a license,
which I'm by no means
sure is genuine.
May I ask the reason for this...
Secret marriage?
I'm not sure it was secret to you.
Oh, come now, Mrs. Demarest.
If I am to believe you,
you must believe me.
But he must
have told you.
He had to be married in
order to get his inheritance.
What would have been the use
of the marriage otherwise?
I don't follow you.
The will.
What will?
The will you encouraged
Jim's mother to draw up.
Surely you remember the clause.
I suppose you refer to the one
which keeps Jim and his
sister's money in trust
until they reach 30.
It always annoyed Jim.
You made yourself
guardian of his fortune.
It must have been extremely difficult
to ask his uncle for money
when he had the right to millions.
Difficult, but not insupportable.
That might be forgivable,
but certainly not passing
control over to the wife
if he married.
No doubt you intended
to choose that wife.
Some placid girl who would
do what you told her,
but Jim was smarter
than you thought.
He married me.
And I am not a placid girl.
No... you're not.
Um... might I ask
where he found you?
We knew one another at college.
I was working for my
doctor's degree in geology.
Hmm. Do your parents
know of this marriage?
No.
No?
They're both dead.
Were you in love with him?
No.
He came to me as a friend,
and I helped him.
Ohh... you helped him.
And exactly what did you
get out of helping him?
I needed money.
He gave me $2,000
to complete my studies.
I was to divorce him
after six months.
There were
no other strings.
I see.
You were married five months.
Jim's death was quite
convenient, wasn't it?
$2,000 has now become 2 million.
Well, what do you
intend to do?
I shall claim the rights
left me in his will.
But he left no will.
I don't know where the original is,
but here's a copy.
No signatures.
It's completely worthless.
I happen to know there is an
original, completely attested.
If you don't find it,
I shall be forced to claim
my entire rights.
If I were to bring
this... battle of wits
down to direct insults,
I'd say you were one of the most
cold-blooded, scheming women
I've ever met in my life.
You've already said that.
For the moment,
we'll let it rest there.
For Jim's sake and
the rest of the family,
I'd prefer no unpleasantness tonight.
I suppose you'll
have to stay the night,
but I'd prefer you left in the morning.
Would it be possible to see...
Your husband?
No. The casket is closed.
You will, however, allow
me to pay my last respects.
This way.
Charles...
Well, Mark, before you say a word,
I can't go through with it.
I'm going back
to Washington at once.
You're not. You're in
this as deeply as I am.
No, I'm not!
Keep your voice down.
The girl's in there.
Well, who is she, anyway?
I'll tell you later.
Uh, my housekeeper Marta
will show you to your room.
Thank you.
Get this straight.
I'm leaving here tomorrow.
How would it look if you
weren't at the funeral?
I should have never consented...
This way, madam.
I'm sorry. I hope I
haven't kept you waiting.
No.
Uncle Mark, how dare you
open my letters!
Julie...
Allow me to introduce you
to Sandra Demarest,
your sister-in-law.
My sister-in-law?
Yes. Jim's widow.
I'm very glad
to know you, Julie.
I'm stunned...
But completely, absolutely stunned.
You're not a bit Jim's type.
Oh, I don't mean you're
not awfully attractive,
because you are, but...
Why, it's stupendous.
Will Amy Daniels be mad.
It serves her right.
Sandra, tell me all
about it. Please, please?
We will, Julie,
if you'll control yourself.
It was a secret marriage.
Oh, how exciting, Sandra.
I'm going to call you
Sandra right off.
Anyway, I'm awfully
glad you're here.
You'll stay for a long time, won't you?
Mrs. Demarest is not
prepared to stay.
Why not?
I have a suitcase
checked at the station.
Well, Becket can bring
it in the morning.
Thank you.
Good.
That's settled.
How about this letter, Mark?
May I ask what right
you had to read it?
I didn't. I wanted the address.
It wasn't on the envelope.
If you think you're busting up
this romance, you're mistaken.
I hardly think this is the proper time
to discuss marriage proposals.
Oh, who said anything
about proposals?
You want me stuck in this
mausoleum all my life?
We'll discuss it later, Julie.
No, we won't!
Sit down.
Good night, Julie.
Yes?
May I come in?
Yes, of course, Julie.
I'd have come before,
but Marta was hanging around.
She's always spying on me.
And that wasn't very nice of
me to talk about Amy Daniels.
But Jim was always
mad about her until-
well, I suppose after
she let him down flat.
Um...
Did she really turn him down?
Oh, she turned him down all right.
It was so strange.
They were engaged.
I know they both were
crazy about each other.
She'd been here playing tennis
the day before it happened.
They were spooning about
something fierce.
And then the very
next day, it went poof!
Don't you think that's strange?
Yes, I do.
Did Jim say anything
about Mark to you?
A few things. Why?
I think Mark was the one
who broke it off.
He's always managed to stop Jim
from doing anything he wanted.
Jim could've done so many good,
fine things with his money.
But I guess you know
about the money.
Yes, I know.
But Mark didn't think so.
He said Jim was
a dreamer, an idealist.
So now he's using the
money for his laboratory,
his plans, his ideas.
Julie, those are
dangerous accusations.
That money's in trust.
That won't stop Mark.
I know him for what he is.
He'll twist you around his finger
like he does everybody else.
Believe me, Julie...
That won't happen.
You're imagining things, aren't you?
That's what Mark says.
He says I'm always imagining things.
You won't let on to him
about what we've been saying,
no matter how he tries
to pry it out of you?
You know I won't.
I knew you were regular.
My, this is attractive.
It's very old.
It came from Florence.
It belonged to my mother.
It's late. I suppose
you want to go to bed.
I am tired.
Then I'm off.
I don't want Marta to start snooping.
Julie...
What did Jim die of?
Of pneumonia.
Didn't Mark tell you?
No, he didn't.
He'd been in Canada.
He came home late at night.
I heard his voice in the library,
I'm sure I did.
The next morning
Mark said he was ill.
And you never saw him again?
They put him
in the laboratory.
I'm never allowed in there.
Oh, Sandra, please stay here.
I'm so terribly lonely in this house.
Nobody to talk to,
people looking at me all the time.
Promise me you'll stay.
I'll stay
as long as I can.
Thank you.
Good night, Sandra.
Good night, Julie.
I think I'm going
to like having a sister.
Same here.
We all go
into the library.
I'm sorry, I must get back
to Washington.
One moment, Charles.
Davenport, go in with
the others, will you?
I'll join you in a moment.
I put in an appearance
at the funeral.
You can't ask for anything more.
It's a question of Jim's will.
You should be here.
No. I don't want anything to do with it.
I hope you won't regret this.
I hope you won't, Mark.
You realize
this whole thing
has been a great shock to us.
So it will take a
certain amount of time-
Mark, I've been
explaining to Mrs. Demarest
we're making every effort
to locate Jim's deposit box.
How long will it take?
Two weeks, I should say.
Oh, then Sandra
can stay. I'm so glad.
Of course Mrs. Demarest can stay.
We want her entirely
satisfied about everything.
I think you should keep
this death certificate.
May I look at it?
Certainly.
I think you'll find it quite in order.
Signed by the local
doctor and undertaker.
May I keep it?
Of course.
You're Jim's widow.
Can't we skip these gruesome details?
It's going to be a nice day.
Can't we go riding, Sandra and I?
Mrs. Demarest may not care to.
It'd be pleasant to get some sunshine.
But I haven't any-
riding habit? Don't worry.
I can find something for you.
Mrs. Demarest...
I've no objection
to your going riding,
but I wish you wouldn't let
Julie take you off the estate.
Don't you think you're holding
too tight a leash on her?
No.
I saw her yesterday jumping fences,
dashing across country.
You can't bottle up
all that energy very long.
No? I must still insist.
But if she doesn't get around
and meet people her own age,
how will she learn discrimination?
Discrimination?
If Julie exercises as much
discrimination as you did about men,
she might not find it
resulted so profitably,
or would she?
I rather asked for that one, didn't I?
Oh, that was wonderful.
It's beautiful here in the woods.
Sandra, you're going
to think me an awful heel.
I brought you riding
under false pretenses.
Julie, we haven't left the estate?
Oh, no.
I'm meeting Ronnie.
Ronnie?
Yes, Ronnie Manning.
He wrote the letter Mark opened.
Until the sun came out,
I was afraid
we wouldn't make it.
Do you think you should?
Why not? I don't know
how much longer
Mark will let me leave
the house, let alone ride.
Why do you say such things?
You'll find out.
There he is, Sandra.
Come and meet him.
No. You go ahead.
I'll wait here.
Where's Julie?
Well, she was right behind me.
I'll ride back and see
what's happened to her.
She's meeting Manning, isn't she?
I was hoping you'd be
more sensible about Julie.
But I'm afraid you're
incurably romantic.
I'm no chaperone.
Don't ask me to be one again.
It's very important for
Julie to be straightforward.
Things like this don't help.
Do you think the atmosphere here
is conducive to being straightforward?
Please accept my handling of Julie.
I've asked you once,
now I'm asking you again.
Sandra!
How long have you been here?
I wish you hadn't done this,
especially after promising me.
I'm afraid Mr. Manning won't like
what I have to tell him either.
How dare you spy on me!
I won't stand it.
I won't!
Now...
If Mrs. Demarest
will please excuse us,
I'd like a word with you.
Get down, please.
Get down!
Where's miss Julie?
She'll be along.
Mr. Mark is with her.
She rides so wild,
I get scared.
I watched you riding in.
You sit a horse well.
Thanks.
Tell me, Roberts,
do they use the rear wing
of the house?
Oh, yes, ma'am. That's
Mr. Caldwell's laboratory.
Thank you.
Julie?
Did you hear it, Sandra?
You did, didn't you?
Julie, what is it?
You heard it.
I didn't imagine it.
Julie, shh. Quiet.
You'll wake everybody.
I've heard it before, a week ago.
Mark says I have nightmares.
That isn't true.
I do hear it.
Hear what?
Voices. People scuffling.
A man crying out in agony.
You heard that tonight?
Yes. And it sounded
like Jim's voice.
Jim's voice?
Oh, no, Julie.
It couldn't be.
Aah!
It is! I tell you-
which is the door into the
other wing of the house?
The laboratory?
Up there.
But it's locked.
It's always locked.
That's where it must have come from.
Get into bed.
Pretend you're asleep.
Julie, I don't know
what's going on here,
but I'm going to find out.
Please stay with me tonight.
No. You'll be all right.
When I leave, lock the door.
In the morning,
tell Mark what you heard.
If he finds I left my room,
they'll lock me in like before.
Don't say you left the room.
Remember, I wasn't with you.
Understand?
Yes.
Remember, Julie,
I wasn't with you.
Yes.
Good morning.
You slept well, I hope.
Soundly, thank you.
Good.
Good morning, Mrs. Demarest.
Good morning, Angela.
I'll just have fruit juice,
toast, and coffee.
I see my brother
is having his troubles.
His political opponents are
after him like a pack of wolves.
Really?
They'd like
nothing better
than to find some
chink in his armor.
If would be a great thing
for the Caldwell family
if the senator landed
such an important position.
You'd be world famous,
not that your scientific
reputation isn't enough.
Hello, everybody.
Good morning, Julie.
Good morning, Julie.
You slept well?
I did not.
You didn't?
Why not?
It happened again last night.
What happened?
Something woke me up.
A sound of scuffling,
and it seemed to come
from the laboratory.
Somebody cried out.
Really, Julie, these
nightmares of yours.
You know perfectly well
no one's in that wing.
It wasn't a nightmare.
I heard it.
You couldn't have.
Didn't you hear it, Sandra?
No. I'm afraid I didn't.
Julie forgets she's
had dreams about my lab
since she
was a child.
Why?
I used to take her
in there quite often
when she was little.
Then she'd start sneaking
in when I wasn't there
and playing around
with the apparatus.
That was dangerous,
so we put a lock on it.
I wasn't asleep.
If there had been some such noise,
wouldn't someone else
have heard it?
Becket's room is-
Becket. He'd say anything
you asked him to.
That's unnecessary.
You're overly excited, my dear.
You have a tendency
that way, haven't you?
May I make a suggestion?
What?
Next time you hear some
odd noise in the night,
just follow the custom of your sex
and stick your head
under the bed clothes.
Excuse me.
You see?
He was lying.
Yes, he was.
What are we going to do?
Do nothing to make him suspicious.
I want to see Jim's room.
What's the day's schedule here?
Who is where at what time?
In the afternoon,
Marta has her nap.
Becket watches me then,
but he has a lot to do.
You won't keep things
from me, will you?
Of course not, Julie, I-
Good morning, Mrs. Demarest.
Good morning.
Miss Julie.
Good morning.
Sandra, let's go out to the garden.
This is Jim's room.
Look, Sandra.
These were all taken last summer.
The girl there with him is Amy Daniels.
That was about two years ago.
Jim was awfully attractive, wasn't he?
Yes.
You know,
there's something curious
about this picture of Jim and Mark.
What do you mean?
It's a friendly-looking
picture...
Not at all what
I was led to believe
about the way Jim
and Mark got along.
Mark used to be sweet to us...
Perhaps because
we were younger,
more under his influence.
It's only when we want
to have our own way
that he's mean.
That was my mother.
She died when
I was 4 years old.
Haven't you any pictures
of your father?
I can't even remember
what he looked like.
He died in a hospital.
They say it broke my mother's heart.
This money
you're to inherit
belonged to your
mother, didn't it?
Yes.
She must've been very
devoted to your uncle Mark.
I know why you say that.
On account of the will.
Who's to know
how devoted she was?
I was 3 when she
and Mark drew it up.
Jim was away at school.
All I know is that father
was taken to a hospital,
died there.
From then on,
mother was never the same.
Julie, is this the way
Jim always kept his room?
Yes.
Nothing's been changed
or taken away?
No. It's exactly the way
it was when he was alive.
I wonder why all his pipes are gone.
Jim was always smoking.
Yes.
He had lots of pipes.
Are these all his clothes?
Oh, no. His sport clothes
are all gone.
The things he wore
for riding, for tennis.
Sandra, what does all this mean?
What are you thinking, Sandra?
You think it really
was Jim last night.
Then what are they doing to him?
What's going on in the laboratory?
Julie.
Sandra, tell me
what's happening in there.
Something horrible.
That's why Mark wouldn't
let anybody in there.
They'll take me next.
That's why they won't
let me off the estate.
I've got to run away.
I won't stay
in this awful place.
I'll run away. They'll
never find me! Never! Never!
Julie, they won't do anything.
Please be sensible
and calm down.
Mrs. Demarest, Mr. Caldwell would
like to see you in the library.
Thank you.
I'll be right down.
Come on, Julie. I'll take you
to your room.
Sandra, I'm afraid.
I'm sorry I upset you.
Please lie down and get some rest.
I'll go see what
your uncle Mark wants.
You'll be all right?
In this room
it isn't so bad...
When the door's closed
and I know that
no one's looking at me.
I don't like eyes
looking at me.
That's when I get frightened.
Then-
I can't explain.
It's as if everything
went dark.
As if something
were closing in on me,
a dark cloud.
And I want to run
and run and run,
but it keeps following me.
Then you mustn't run away.
Turn and face it.
That's what I always do.
But aren't you ever afraid?
Everyone's afraid
once in a while.
For instance, a minute ago I was afraid
when I thought
Jim was alive.
I thought the way you did,
that they were doing
something awful to him.
And you see what happened?
I made you afraid.
And that was stupid.
Fear is stupid.
Get some rest.
I'll try.
You wanted to see me?
Yes.
I know
Julie likes you.
I thought
it would be nice
for her
to have a companion,
but I thought I'd also made it clear
she cannot have her head.
I'm told you were both
in Jim's room
and that Julie was greatly upset.
Can't you see
that dwelling on Jim
is the worst possible
thing you could do to Julie?
I don't know
what plans you have
in that devious
feminine mind.
If you're trying to
enlist Julie's sympathy,
don't do it.
And if I ignore
your advice?
I'll kick you out.
That wouldn't do any good.
Julie's very fond of me.
That's exactly why
I've been so forbearing.
So long as you're in this house,
I'd like her to keep
her illusions about you.
She wouldn't have any if
she knew why you're here.
If I'm to believe you're acting
in Julie's best interests,
then you must believe I'm here
because I have a right to be.
Of course, Mrs. Demarest.
You're here because you're
a member of the family,
an unhappy bride of five months.
You're wasting your time.
Don't forget, Mr. Caldwell,
I have a card up my sleeve-
a little matter of a will which
your lawyer is attempting to find.
I can assure you that if
Davenport does find the will,
I, for one, shall be vastly relieved.
The Caldwells have always
been very proud of their women.
No doubt you've noticed their
portraits around the walls.
All of them beautiful.
Some of them clever.
My grandfather, for
instance, married a dancer.
She was
the toast of Paris.
Doesn't sound
like a Caldwell.
He was
a venturesome fellow.
Sailed around the horn as a lad.
Captain of
a sailing ship.
Care for a drink?
Unfortunately, his
romance with the dancer
came to a bad end.
Really?
She died two months
after they were married.
What a pity.
He poisoned her.
Something wrong?
Quite an interesting
liqueur, isn't it?
Made from a recipe
belonging to our family
and only used on special occasions.
You consider this a special occasion?
I certainly do.
Lovely color, too, isn't it?
And a fascinating name-
<i>lagrima sangue.</i>
Do you know Italian?
Enough to know that it
means tears of blood.
I forgot. Of course.
You're a college graduate, aren't you?
Well, to the will.
Bless its little heart.
It's very good.
Thank you.
I'm glad to see you have an
appreciation of good things.
In fact, I'm beginning to
realize it more and more.
You're altogether
a very charming person.
Thank you.
Attractive.
I like women with steady eyes,
firm chin.
My teeth are also very good.
And, of course, a sense of humor.
Am I to turn this into a
mutual admiration society?
I think
it's a little late
for you to change your
first impression of me.
You don't like me, do you?
Hmm...
Silence is revealing.
I'm the silent type.
Are you?
I wonder what type you really are.
Surely your scientific mind
has figured that out by now.
It would be interesting to
know into which category I fall.
Category?
Don't you catalog all women
and keep them neatly filed
in a sort of
mental card index?
In my human relations,
I'm quite open-minded.
You surprise me.
Then I am progressing.
Yes.
I think it's time
I got dressed for dinner.
By dinnertime, we'll be
right back where we started.
You underestimate yourself.
Then I have made an
impression. A good one, I hope.
Don't answer. Just let
me use my imagination.
Can I trust it?
Not to carry me too far?
I'd sooner
not commit myself.
I prefer to give it free rein.
I'd like to probe behind that
sphinxlike exterior of yours,
find out what goes on
behind those eyes...
Those very lovely eyes.
Why did you do that?
The scientist in me
came uppermost.
The scientist?
Yes.
Purely research.
I wanted to confirm my
first impression of you.
And did you?
I did.
Mrs. Demarest!
Mrs. Demarest!
Miss Julie would like to know
if she could borrow your cold cream.
Certainly, Angela.
Did miss Julie have a rest?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
No! Don't! Don't!
Please don't!
I'm just doing what
I'm told, miss Julie.
Miss Julie is asleep.
Mrs. Demarest, I've
been meaning to ask you.
Would you like some hot
chocolate before bed?
Now that you've mentioned
it, it sounds very nice.
Sorry. You could have had it last night.
I'm new. It takes a while
to get used to things.
It's not too much trouble?
Oh, no. Miss Julie
always has hot chocolate.
Mr. Caldwell has sandwiches and scotch
in the laboratory.
Must be a problem to get
anything to Mr. Caldwell
sealed up in his lab.
Becket always fixes his tray.
It goes up
in the dumbwaiter.
Of course
nobody else does it.
Mr. Mark is so particular
about the laboratory.
I guess he does need
something working so late.
Sometimes he works as late as 2:00.
Sometimes all night, I wager.
No, ma'am. He has
very regular habits.
It's never later than 2:00.
He's sort of particular about that.
He likes us to be regular, too.
For instance, Becket always
sends the tray up at 12:00.
Once it was 12:30, and
Mr. Mark didn't like it.
I'll bring your hot chocolate
in just a few minutes.
Thank you, Angela.
You mustn't come here
again unless I tell you.
You understand?
Is everything all right
at three hills?
I wish you could come out
sometime.
That's impossible.
You mean on account of that girl?
Who is she?
She claims to be Jim's wife.
Jim's wife?
We're checking her story.
In the meantime, if she
should find out anything-
that's my problem.
That prescription you wanted
is in
the filing cabinet.
I'll get it
while you're here.
I'm getting kind of worried
about the prescriptions.
I don't like the idea of
filling it around here.
You know how the gossips
are at the drugstore.
Everybody knows
everybody else's business.
Have it filled in Salem.
Don't bother me with details.
You sure Doc Reynolds is all right?
Reynolds is a old family friend.
I'll take care of him.
I'm not suggesting you're
not doing your part.
Stop talking nonsense.
I don't remember
sending that tray down.
Aah!
Where is she?
Don't look.
Julie! Julie!
Oh, no.
No.
It was an accident.
She was trying to run away-
that's a lie.
It was an accident.
That's a lie!
This way, doctor.
I'll have to notify the coroner.
That's the law in case of violent death.
If she was trying
to run away,
she wouldn't have taken this. It's mine.
Someone else packed it.
Someone who does
what you tell her to do.
Stop that, Angela.
I'll never forgive myself, never...
Being asleep last night
when it happened.
Maybe if I'd been awake,
I might have heard something
and stopped her some way.
Nobody could have done
anything last night.
It happened too quickly.
Come.
We're finished in here.
Three hills.
Have you any explanation
for your remarkable behavior?
What is this insane
desire to get into my lab?
I want to find Jim.
And what makes you think
Jim has risen from the dead?
I don't think he is dead.
You really are
a remarkable woman.
You fling the most
amazing accusations at me
without proof of any kind...
Or do you think
you have some proof?
Maybe.
Don't try my patience too far.
What do you know?
I don't know
what you've done to Jim
or where he is,
but I do know
what happened to Julie.
You drove her to her death.
It was an accident.
I don't believe it.
I don't give
a hoot in Hades.
I warned you about Julie.
You ignored my advice.
Filling her head with
stupid ideas about me.
You made her afraid.
The poor kid
tried to run away
from the home
where she was loved.
Why did you keep her
a prisoner?
I thought it best for her.
The night I arrived, she talked
about your treatment of Jim.
There's something else
you should know.
Everything she said about
hearing a man's voice scream
was all true.
I know
because I heard it, too.
She was with me.
We heard it together.
She was with you?
In my room.
We knew you were lying.
I see.
And to what use do you
intend putting this knowledge?
Well, what are you going to do?
Answer me!
I think
you'd better leave.
Wait.
You seem to prefer that way.
Here's something else you may need.
"Earth to earth,
"ashes to ashes,
"dust to dust.
"In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection
"unto eternal life through
Our Lord Jesus Christ,
"at whose coming in glorious
majesty to judge the world,
"the earth and the sea
shall give up their dead,
"and the corruptible bodies
of those who sleep in him
shall be changed and made like
unto his own glorious body."
Oh, Marta, you'll all be
leaving on tonight's train.
Yes, sir.
I'll be driving. You can
take my things with you.
Pack me an overnight bag, will you?
Yes, sir.
The last time
of anything is sad,
but sometimes
not knowing it is the
last time is even worse.
I was thinking of that ride
Julie and I took together.
If she had known,
how she would have
drained every last moment
of its happiness.
They could at least
have left this room alive
until we left.
You may not believe it,
but this was once
a very happy house...
When Jim and Julie
were kids.
I remember one summer- 4th
of July, I think it was-
we invited everybody
from Miles around
to come and celebrate
and bring their kids.
Julie had
a small pony then.
She must have been
about 5 or 6, I guess.
She was giving
the other kids rides.
One little guy got bucked
off into the fish pond.
She laughed so hard
at that kid standing there
shivering in his wet things,
all the other kids
started jumping in, too,
just to hear her laugh
some more.
That's the effect
her laughter had on you.
You wanted to hear it
again and again.
There's something
I'd like to show you.
Most people don't appreciate
fine old pieces like this.
I thought perhaps you might.
This was my father's
wedding present to my mother...
And this was given to my
sister when Jim was born.
No jewel
is quite like a pearl.
Just like the ocean
they come from-
the same depth,
the same coldness.
The same subtle cruelty
just beneath the surface.
This my brother and I
gave her when Julie was born.
That was a great event
for a us, a girl.
The Caldwells
generally run to boys.
These were all meant for Julie
when she grew old enough
to appreciate them.
Take what you want.
Why me?
You're Jim's widow.
You've changed your mind
about me, haven't you?
I spoke to Davenport on
the telephone this morning.
Jim's safety deposit box
has been found.
I see.
It was opened by court order.
The will was in it
completely attested.
It's a little late for apologies.
Things have gone
too far for that.
I'm leaving for Washington.
You're welcome to stay
in the Boston house
as long as you want.
I can't understand
why you want me around
after what's happened.
When tragedy strikes a house,
the lives
of everyone in it
become tangled up.
What are you going to do?
I haven't decided yet.
You know, I-
I really am very sorry
for having treated you
the way I have.
Thank you.
And there's
something else.
Come with me, will you?
Where are we going?
To my lab.
You always wanted to
get in there, didn't you?
Well, I did, but now-
at least give me a chance
to change your opinion of me.
Why bother?
I wouldn't want you leaving
thinking badly of me.
What makes you think
showing me an empty room
will change
my opinion of you?
It'll be a beginning.
Of what?
We seem to have built
a wall between us.
I'd like to try to break it down.
You see, Sandra,
I find I like you very much,
very much indeed.
What is this?
More scientific research?
You don't forget very easily, do you?
No.
No, I don't forget.
This room
I think you know.
You see?
Simple workroom.
No hidden secrets,
no mysterious strangers.
Who is Laidell?
Laidell?
He's a sort of gamekeeper.
Been with you a long time?
Quite long.
Like doctor Reynolds,
an old and trusted friend
as well as a servant?
That's right.
Must be wonderful
to command such loyalty.
It is.
How can you give it all up,
go and live in an
apartment in Washington,
leave this house, this estate?
I couldn't work here anymore.
There's too many
unhappy memories.
What are you doing about the horses?
Horses?
Selling them.
Have they gone yet?
No. Why?
I should like to ride.
Do you mind?
Of course not.
There's nothing to do
until we leave tonight.
I'll call down
to the stables.
Roberts, Mrs. Demarest
is going riding.
Yes.
Let her have Colonel, will you?
Good afternoon, Mrs. Demarest.
Well, there he is all ready.
Thanks, Roberts.
I shan't be long.
What will you do now that
the house is being closed?
I got a job at the mannings', ma'am.
Have you been here long?
About five years before the war.
Were you in the service?
Yes, ma'am.
Canadian air force.
Two years overseas.
Well, there he is.
He needs some exercise.
A good horse, he is.
I'll miss him.
I don't want to ride off the estate.
How far does it extend exactly?
Go down the road
as far as that other gate
and back into the woods
as far as them three hills.
The three hills?
That's the game preserve.
It's a lonely place.
Nobody goes there no more.
Is there a lodge there?
Yes, ma'am.
Never used no more.
If you're thinking
of riding over that way,
I shouldn't.
It's overgrown.
Don't worry. I won't.
Have a good ride, ma'am.
Jim! Jim!
All right!
I'm coming!
Jim.
Jim.
I've been searching for you
everywhere,
ever since I came to Willow Miles.
Willow Miles?
Don't you remember me?
It's so difficult to remember.
It's been difficult
ever since the accident.
What accident?
I'll be all right.
I'll stay here until I'm well.
The Laidells take care of me.
What do you mean,
take care of you?
They give me things
to make me sleep.
If they didn't,
I wouldn't be able to.
Jim, listen to me.
Don't you remember
the things you told me
about Mark
trying to get your money?
That's why we married-
to stop him from getting it.
Surely, you remember that.
Mark sent me here.
You told me you thought he
was planning to murder you.
Sandra, I remember you.
Jim, last week there was a funeral.
It was a mock funeral.
People think you're dead.
Mark arranged it.
Why do you lie to me?
Why should Mark
do a thing like that?
He has control of your
money and Julie's, too.
Julie's too young
to give him his way.
He won't hurt her.
Jim... Julie is dead.
She was driven to her
death. Mark did it.
You say Mark did it?
He has all the money,
just as you were afraid of.
<i>I was afraid of that.</i>
He's closing the house,
going away.
No one must know
you're alive.
Don't you understand, Jim?
But you know, Sandra.
He can't close my mouth
with money
the way he did the
undertaker and the doctor.
But he can close your mouth.
He wouldn't dare.
What's that?
Laidell.
Supper's ready!
Coming!
Now listen to me.
Go back to the house.
I'll have to wait till
they think I'm asleep.
When they give me my sleeping
pills, I'll fool them.
After they're asleep,
I'll leave.
Jim!
Take it easy, Laidell.
I'm coming.
Take this path here.
It leads around
behind the shed
where they keep the truck.
Mrs. Laidell will be
coming back with it.
Slip through the gate
before she locks it.
How are you
going to get out?
I'll meet you at the house.
Don't worry. They both sleep like logs.
Watch yourself.
Jim. Jim, what's going on?
You're like an old hen,
Laidell. Here I am.
How about some cards after dinner?
Why, sure. Sure, Jim. Anything you say.
What happened?
I was thrown.
I thought so when the
horse came back without you.
We've searched
for hours.
I'm sorry.
Oh, that's all right.
It's lucky you weren't hurt.
I kept a fire going in
the library. Come on in.
You must have ridden
quite a long way.
Yes.
How far?
I don't know.
Through the woods.
I can't tell exactly.
Roberts.
It's all right.
Mrs. Demarest is back.
Yes.
Well, I won't see you again,
so goodbye, and thank you.
Well, it's too late
for the train,
so you'll have to
drive in with me.
Marta left you a tray.
Won't you eat something?
No, thank you.
I'm not hungry.
The sooner we go,
the better.
Would you mind
if I stayed here tonight?
I'll take a taxi to the
station in the morning.
The house is closed.
There's no one here.
I can manage.
Then I'll stay on, too.
I wouldn't want you to change
your plans on my account.
That's all right.
I prefer it.
I don't like driving
at night either.
I'll be all right, really.
Won't you please-
you're not trying to drive me
out of my own house, are you?
No, of course not.
Look...
Sandra...
You and I may never
see each other again,
so there's something
I should tell you.
I think I will have
something to eat.
I'll take it to my room.
Why don't you just
have it by the fire?
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
Jim.
Jim.
Jim, I-
what are you doing?
Let me go.
What made you think
I was Jim?
You still think
he's alive, don't you?
Yes.
I don't know who or what
was in the coffin,
but Jim is alive.
I've seen him.
I've spoken to him.
All right.
You want the truth,
you'll have it.
I tried to tell you inside,
but you wouldn't listen.
You're not going
to like it.
There was a very good
reason for the will
that made me trustee
for Jim and Julie.
Their father died
in a sanitarium,
violently insane.
Their father was in...
Oh, no.
No.
There's proof
in my safe.
I wonder if you...
If you have any idea
what it is to live in
the shadow of insanity.
The terror of it.
The...
Well, if you had, you could
understand a lot of things.
Ever since
they were children,
I had to take care
of them, watch them,
for any sign of that terrible thing
I knew
was in their blood.
I took them to the finest psychiatrists,
the finest doctors.
They could do nothing
except tell me to...
Watch them.
Watch them carefully.
I did my best.
If you are
telling the truth,
what really happened to Julie?
I can only give you an opinion.
No one was in the room
with her.
No one spoke to her.
I think Julie knew
about herself.
I believe
she committed suicide.
Then why did you try to make
it look like an accident?
I had to because of...
Because of my brother.
If his enemies, and
he has plenty of them,
ever knew that a Caldwell
had committed suicide,
that there was insanity
in the family-
you said the insanity
is in the Demarest blood.
That wouldn't have stopped them.
They would have crucified
him. I had to protect him.
Why do you keep Jim a prisoner?
Jim killed a man.
I don't believe it.
Don't you? You're
going to listen anyway.
He was on vacation in Canada,
shortly after you were
married, I imagine.
His car skidded,
there was an accident.
He got into an argument
with a gas station attendant,
hit him with a wrench.
He died the next day.
I used every bit of
influence my brother and I had
to keep it out of
the American papers.
The upshot of it was...
The court committed him to my care.
Rigid confinement for
the rest of his life.
Most of the time he's quite normal.
Then something happens that
upsets him, and he goes berserk.
Like the other night.
I had to keep him in that wing
until the compound was ready.
Now perhaps you can imagine how I felt
when you suddenly appeared
and claimed to be his wife.
I had been warned that
under no circumstances
could either Jim or Julie
ever marry, have children.
But it can't be true.
I've seen Jim.
I've talked with him.
He's as normal as you or I. He-
Jim!
He was telling you a lot of
lies, and you believed him.
No, I didn't.
But you might have killed him.
Would it make
any difference?
Are you in love with him?
No, Jim, of course not, but I...
You are in love with him.
Let me go.
You're going away
with me.
But first I want
to destroy those papers.
The papers?
I heard Mark.
I can open the safe.
I don't want any proof...
Proof of anything.
We'll get in a car
and go away.
You do want to go away
with me, don't you, Sandra?
Don't you?
Sandra!
Why are you
afraid of me, Sandra?
I've never hurt anybody.
You and Mark think
you'll put me away again,
but you won't
get the chance.
I don't want you
to go back there.
I begged you
to come with me.
You think I'm crazy.
I'm not.
I won't hurt you, Sandra.
I know, Jim. I know.
Jim!
Don't move.
If you do, I'll...
I'm not going back in that
pen for the rest of my life.
You hate me.
No, Jim. No.
Yes, you do.
So does Sandra.
I heard enough just now.
I don't like people to hate me.
Nobody hates you, Jim.
Let's talk about this...
Quietly.
This could only make
trouble for all of us.
No. No!
I'm going
my own way.
I warn you, don't try to stop me.
Aah!
It's...
It's better this way.
It was all my fault.
No. No, you shouldn't
blame yourself.
I was so stubborn.
So suspicious.
So hard to convince.
Why not?
I didn't trust you either.
