This is one of my favorite
spaces in the White House.
We call it the colonnade.
I filled it with beautiful art
that holds special meaning
to my husband and me.
This is where I first met the President.
And this is a bust of
Miss Heather Chandler
of Sherwood, Ohio.
It reminds me of the first time
I watched my husband attempt a murder.
And this is Butcher's Bridge,
the very spot where I
knew for the first time
that I truly loved the President.
It's also the very spot where
the President betrayed me
and then lied about it.
As a role model, I have a
duty to set an example
to women all across our great nation.
So they know that lies
and betrayal of any kind
are unacceptable.
And can never... happen again.

"Dear diary,
"so the doctors told me
they can only keep JD
"against his will in what's
called a mental hold
for three days, and it had
to be for a good reason."
He blew up his car. A Porsche.
- Damn.
- He's the craziest one in here.
"So, I guess JD has three days
"to make up for what he did.
"Three days to learn
how to be a proper boyfriend."
Good morning, sunshine.
_
And we're doing...
a-one, two, three, noose.
One, two, three, razor blade.
One, two, three, drink poison.
And... splits.
And bang!
Shoot yourself.
Epic.
Heather, play your cards right
and you can end up in my shoes one day.
Uh, excuse me? I won't do splits.
All great dance numbers
end with splits, Heather.
I just don't think Sue E.
Cyde would do them.
It feels unmotivated.
She's about to kill herself, Heather.
Of course splits are motivated.
Or is it because our
actress can't do them?
Heather, do you know who's
coming to our preview?
Amita.
Amita and her massive
social media footprint.
I know who Amita is, Heather.
Then you know that one post
to her 600,000 followers
takes me and my campaign to end
suicide to the next level.
And you know that with Amita coming,
we have all the more reason
for our lead to do splits.
Maybe we need a new choreographer, hm?
Someone who gets art.
Oh.
Or maybe we need a new actress. Bang.
Heather, using a gun in school
is a very serious issue.
Who is Heather?
Me.
I don't understand.
We need to expel her.
Is that your preferred pronoun?
For old people, my preferred
pronoun is "don't talk to me."
Now, why is his name Heather?
Why would his parents name him Heather?
I thought we were
supposed to say "they."
You know, I find "they"
to be very confusing.
Whatever it is, we need to expel them.
Them? There are two now?
No, we're talking about her.
You just said "them."
Well, we mean him.
Don't call him "him."
Can you believe her?
I thought we weren't
supposed to say "her."
I meant her, not them.
Well, who is "them," then?
For crying out loud,
what is going on here?
We expelled Lizzy for
bringing a gun to school,
- Maurice.
- Okay, Lizzy was poor.
We didn't know what she was capable of.
Let's be honest. Them's
not hurting anyone.
Heather does have the face of an angel.
I guess you're right.
I've never heard of a
redhead committing a crime.
- Mm.
- But we need to send a message.
And I have just the punishment
for zim.
Who is Zim?
What the hell did he do?
What is this?
"Westerburg Considered,"
Westerburg's balanced and
thoughtful news program.
- Eww.
- You've never seen it?
Our show airs every morning
during first period.
Obviously I've never
been here that early.
Heather, I want you
to bring your formidable
entertainment skills
to the table and help these young men
turn "Westerburg Considered"
into a hit.
Or... get expelled
and run the risk of having to
come back here another year.
Why does it smell like SPF 1,000?
Oh, hello, Heather.
They're making me do
journalism, Heather.
Like, the boring kind for ugly people.
Maybe you could talk to them,
say it wasn't a big deal?
But it was a big deal, Heather.
You threatened me.
I don't know how long
it's gonna take for me
to feel safe again here at Westerburg.
Can you not be a total teratoma for once
and just help me?
Actually, I don't think I can.
I would for a real friend.
But... you tried to make a play
for my throne before
my body was even cold.
You were dead.
You left me.
You know, I always knew
you'd come crawling back
like the seasonal Halloween
store employee you are.
- Okay.
- Your ambition, again,
outstrips your skills, Heather.
Proximity to power is really
the most someone like you
can ever ask for, and if
I have to take that away
so you learn your lesson, then so be it.
Eww.
Father, I need your advice.
I know you always taught
me to be number one.
And, of course, in most
areas of my life I am.
I'm the richest. I'm the hottest.
I have the alabaster
skin of a cursed prince.
But at school, I'm still second fiddle.
Because of her.
Heather.
Obviously, I know the real reason
she won't let me rise
up to my rightful place
is because she's deeply jealous of me.
Just like Mom, I guess.
Witch.
You think I would be happy
she fell down the staircase
just like your first wife did.
And I am.
It's almost as if I
psychologically only feel
comfortable when a strong,
overbearing woman
with questionably garish style
lords over my every whim.
So, I ask you...
Dad...
what should I do about Heather Chandler?
What's that, Dad?
Systematically destroy her and
everything she holds dear
by any means necessary,
just like you did with Mom?
Thank you, Dad.
"Dear diary,
"in order to move forward as a couple,
"JD has a lot more to learn.
Like how to communicate."
Are you sure you want
me to read your diary?
No, I mean...
you should read it.
They're your words.
"I know I made a mistake, Veronica,
and I know I can never
actually make it up to you."
But that's why I'm here, JD.
I'm telling you
that you can at least try.
"But I don't deserve you, Veronica.
"I cheated on you.
"You were hopelessly devoted,
"and I threw all of that away
on just one stupid
kiss with Betty Finn."
That's true.
But I'm a forgiving person.
That's so good of you, Veronica.
And hey...
I'll get there. I will.
It's just...
your crime was so big...
So hurtful...
that I couldn't let you go
to jail for attacking Betty.
The punishment just
wouldn't fit the crime.
For you to truly atone...
you need me.
As judge,
jury,
and executioner.
I'm a good kid.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
I'm a good person.
- You're not.
- I am!
You're not, you're not, you're not...
- Shut up.
- You're not, you're not,
- you're not.
- Shut up!
Nurse, help.
She's... she's trying to kill me.
She did this to me, okay?
She put me here. She
wants me in one place
so she can murder me. Please, help me.
The new ones always do this.
He'll calm down in a few hours.
She's evil. God!
She's going to kill me.
God, you have to help me.
Please?
No. No!
Somebody help me. No!
Stop! Stop.
You calm down.
This little blonde girl
here's not gonna kill anyone.
He'll get better.
Just takes some time.
_
And the blue bins are for
glass and cans, as well,
or just cans?
You can actually put both
in the blue bins, Seth.
Fascinating, Driffany.
And that's because
non-carbon-based pla...
"Westerburg Considered."
No one is watching
your little news show.
Recycling, blah, blah.
SAT prep, blah, blah.
Suicide prevention, blah-freaking-blah.
Where are my high-speed chases?
Where are my dead white girls?
I mean, none of your news anchors
are even yelling at the
viewers with seething hatred.
Well, the intended purpose
of "Westerburg Considered"
is to inform the student body.
Inform? I'm already dead from boredom.
I'm floating above myself.
I'm looking down on my body.
My jawline looks great.
The purpose of the media
isn't to inform, Peter.
It's to destroy.
- But shouldn't we...
- Kyle.
Heather Duke is talking.
So here is more the vibe
we'll be going for.
- _
- <i>And we're supposed to believe</i>
you simply ran away for two years?
That you weren't abducted
by a wayward trucker?
That you weren't held against your will
and made to perform indecent sex acts
in a taxidermy shed?
That you weren't tossed,
gasping for life,
off the balcony of a cruise ship
by an illegal immigrant?
I honestly was just in Portland.
Pbbbbbhhh.
Well, it's Stockholm
Syndrome, baby girl.
Help me, help me, help me,
dear viewers, help this girl
find the sick, twisted,
and demented individual
who did this to her.
And you're in my prayers.
And in my unborn's prayers.
Next up...
a wealthy suburb in Ohio
is rocked by suicide.
- _
- Could this be related to the murder
of a little girl years ago?
We'll find out next time on "Lexi Anne."
That is news.
Now, everyone knows the
best way to ratings gold
is to think of a Bundt cake-looking cow
named Heather Chandler who's wronged you
and use your platform to
bring that heifer down.
Westerburg, our days are numbered.
We're killing ourselves left and right.
The ocean is filled with
flaming polar bear carcasses,
and none of you will ever have jobs.
Hi, welcome to "Hellscape
with Heather Duke."
Now, let's get to some
hot takes before we die.
Hot take: human fish bones
spinning around a garbage disposal...
Betty Finn...
was sent to military school.
Why does she hate our troops?
Not sure. Why don't you ask her?
Next hot take:
global warming is a problem.
And yet Trailer Parker is spending
how much energy rolling around
in her space wheelchair?
Not sure. Next time you see her,
ask her why she hates the rain forest.
Spoiler: it's because she's poor.
_
Blind item:
guess which one of Ohio's
biggest influencers
is coming to judge Heather C.
in her musical?
Amita, Amita, Amita.
Number one: she was the first
person to vacation to Iceland.
Number two: she's never been in a car.
Number three: her
favorite color is clear.
Will she hate Heather's performance,
thus destroying her at Westerburg?
I'll never tell.
Now it's time for
"Westerburg Expo-o-o-osed."
Kyle, is it?
Tell me, who do you want to expose?
Peter Dawson.
I'm listening.
He masturbates in the library.
Every afternoon. Right in Biography.
Sometimes in Life Sciences.
Sounds like a case of the
gooey decimal system to me.
Well, that's all the
time we have for today.
Join us tomorrow. Or
don't, if you're dead.
As we say here on "Hellscape,"
everyone is wrong but you.
"Dear diary, I believe in JD.
"I believe he can change.
"I believe he can be the boyfriend
"I know he's capable of being.
"All he needs is some guidance,
"some... instruction.
"And I am happy
to provide that for him."
"My precious Veronica,
"I am so incredibly sorry
"I didn't go with you to
Heather McNamara's funeral.
"I owed it to you to be
there to support you.
"I messed up. I was wrong.
And it will never happen again."
I'll be there in a minute, lemmings.

Amita.
Oh.

So, what did you think?
It was intense.
You really think so?
I've never seen anything like it.
- We died.
- We're dead.
That last song?
Wow. Just wow.
Was that when she came out and
screamed for three minutes?
I feel like there was a lot
of moisture in the room.
It's... it's a very
physical performance.
Yeah, it looked like you
were trying really hard.
It's amazing how breathlessly proud
of your body you were/are.
Well, I think it's really important
to set a precedent for body
positivity at all times.
I love how I look.
Well, good luck with that.
You love how you look?
It's funny. At Westerburg,
people think you're a queen.
They fear you. They love you.
They want to be you.
But I know the truth.
And I know that it's all an act.
You're a lie, Heather.
You're a joke.
You're a housewife singing
karaoke on a girls' night.
Strip away all the bells and whistles,
what's left?
Just a fat girl with money.
Oh, sorry.
You love your body.
You accept yourself.
So, prove it.
Hmm?
Heather?
I'm so sorry.
I don't want to bug you, but...
I just had to say that was wonderful.
I mean, you were wonderful.
I know my opinion
probably doesn't mean anything, but...
that last song, I just
related to it so much.
I just know you're gonna
be on Broadway one day.
Grow up, Trailer Parker.
Blind item: what boisterous bitch's
Broadway bid went bust?
Spoiler alert: it's Heather Chandler.
"Teenage Suicide: Don't
Do It" was dragged
to hell and back by
everyone who matters.
Let's pour some gasoline on
this Dumpster fire, shall we?
_
This one's my favorite.
Her star is falling faster
than a stack of bricks.
But wait, there's more?
Time for hot takes.
My hot take: Heather's
show wasn't just bad.
It was E-V-I-L... EVIL.
This eagle-eyed reporter
spotted some occult imagery
in some of the sets.
Art or witchcraft?
I just hope the administration
does the right thing
and shuts down the musical.
I don't want Satanism in my school.
Do you?
All I know is that Heather
Chandler is over.
Aah!
Stupid! Freaking!
Aah!
"Dear diary,
"one of the most important
parts of a relationship
is getting along with the parents."
Dry rub chicken,
chicken-fried chicken...
Oh, poor thing.
Well... look at you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Aren't you just the
world's best girlfriend,
sitting here all night
keeping JD company?
Bud is just so thankful. Bud!
You know how men are with emotions.
- Stiff upper lip.
- Mm.
Plus, I don't think he'll ever get over
what JD did to that Porsche.
That was expensive.
Ooh, I like that. That's cute.
I wish I could wear that shade.
- Oh.
- Bud!
Veronica here has been caring
for your son all damn night.
I think the least you
could do is say hello.
Hello, Veronica.
Aren't we gonna thank her
for watching after JD?
Thank you, Veronica.
Men, I swear.
Is it really that hard to say thank you?
It's like pulling panties off a pig.
No, go. Go say hi to your son.
You're an embarrassment,
just like your mother.
Thanks for all your help, Veronica.
I think JD's got a winner
in this girl right here.
Oh.
- Oh.
- Let's go.
Bye.
"JD is so close to being the
perfect boyfriend, diary.
"Clearly, his father and
the idiot he's dating
"absolutely love me.
"But something still
doesn't feel quite right.
"Well, he has 24 hours to figure it out.
I hope for his sake he does."
Expelled?
I'm sorry, Heather, but the
recommended punishment
for attempted murder is expulsion.
Have fun being homeschooled, Heather.
- What...
- I'm sure that
if I just talked to Mrs. Duke,
we could come to an understanding.
Where is your mother, Heather?
Um... probably in hell.
Yeah, but your stepmother is
on her way, right, Heather?
Is someone eating beef jerky?
Young lady, this is a private meeting.
I don't know what kind of
school you're running here,
Ms. Fleming, but it certainly
doesn't seem appropriate
to bring in an actual streetwalker
to teach the children about the dangers
of the sex working industry.
Streetwalker?
I got this at the good mall.
We really do need to cover up
in a learning environment.
Let me tell you a story, lady.
When I first started stripping
down at the Grab Bag,
I kept an eye out for the high-rollers:
men with visible gold,
fresh socks.
Then one day this nerd walks in,
and I gave him the same
look you're giving me now.
But then, in the midst of my routine,
when everyone else was
tossing out 1s and 5s,
this guy held up his phone
and showed me the biggest
bank account balance
I had ever seen.
That man was your father.
So, ma'am...
When you judge by appearances,
you might just overlook
the hero
who changes your life.
I don't understand.
Bitch, I was coming in here
to take your side.
I hate this undead Rue McClanahan here.
What?
I didn't even do anything.
You dare to cast judgment on me?
My poor, unfortunate
stepson/daughter
is never gonna feel safe
until Heather is gone from Westerburg.
What if we take Heather's car away?
- Uh...
- How much would it take
for you to agree to that?
Wow.
My dignity is only worth 20 bucks?
Mm.
Mm.
Okay.
Well, looks like
we've come to an agreement.
And how am I supposed to get
to school?
Oh...
I peed.
I don't want to do this, JD.
I don't want to hurt you.
But you've left me with no choice.
You have always looked at me
as... an accessory,
an accomplice.
But is that really what
you want in a girlfriend?
Just your dutiful First Lady?
Seen but not heard?
Other guys like that bullshit, but...
I was so sure
that you weren't like other guys.
And yet...
I don't even know
that you respect me.
Because if you did,
why would you lie about Betty, JD?
Why would you lie to an equal?
Why?
Answer me.
I said answer me!
Why would you throw that vase, JD?
What?
You just threw that vase.
You... you went crazy.
I-I'm really scared, JD.
You're right.
I messed up.
I lied because I'm weak
and I don't deserve you.
But I'll never do it again,
because, Veronica,
I love you so deeply
and completely.
You're lying to me.
I'm not.
My darling.
Shut up.
But why, Veronica?
I love you.
You still don't get it.
You're not even close.
I hope you like this little room.
Because you're never
seeing the outside of it.
You love me.
You think I'm amazing.
You want to be me.
Mm. Okay.
Known as the fastest
predator on the savannah,
the cheetah corners its quarry.
- Run, you dumb baby bunny.
- The cheetahs work together
to corner the prey
and take him down.
Soon, the rest of the pack will arrive.
_
I ran into Betty's mom at
the grocery store today.
Oh?
She said they sent Betty away.
To military school.
Betty? Why?
She always seemed like such a good kid.
Well, she didn't say why.
Maybe she's been acting out lately.
Mm.
Do you think it's because of... ?
- Where is she?
- In her room.
- Because of what happened?
- Anne, we only have a year
till she's out of the house.
I don't want to rock the boat.
- But, Kevin, we need to talk...
- No, just drop it.
We have our safety to think about, too.
Oh.
"Dear diary, well, there you have it.
"I have the perfect boyfriend
"with all the perfect things,
"like flowers and dinners and listening.
"And I hate it.
"I hate it because it's a lie.
"And the one thing I thought
I had with JD was the truth.
"Pure, honest, nothing-held-back truth.
But that was a lie, too."
"So, now I have no choice
but to do this."
Three days are up.
You're free to go.
No, no.
Veronica.
I loved you.
Of course, I was coming
here to kill you,
but that was only because I loved you.
Suicide was for them, not for us.
Not... not for you.
There's never gonna be
another girl like you.
You were the only girl like you.
And you're right. I didn't see that.
I didn't see the girl that you were.
But that girl, she was even more amazing
than I could have ever imagined.
I mean, she was even
more sick and twisted
than I could ever hope to be.
You blew up my car.
You had me committed.
And I loved that.
I loved you, Veronica Sawyer.
And I'm never gonna love anybody again.
Oh, damn.
Don't do anything you're gonna regret.
The only thing that I want to do
is kiss you.
