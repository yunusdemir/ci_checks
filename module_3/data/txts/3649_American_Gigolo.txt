- Julian.
- Hey.
- You came all the way out here?
- Yeah.
I had to leave somebody off
up on the beach.
- Thought I'd drop by.
- It's been weeks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hello, girls.
You mean you didn't fly down to Rio
for the weekend?
- Don't mind them. They're just jealous.
- I don't mind.
I've been trying to reach you all day.
Yeah, I got the message. Number?
Tonight. It's a woman
from Charlottesville.
She's flying in to close a negotiation
on her husband's estate.
- First time?
- Yeah.
She's meeting with the lawyers
in the morning.
They want a chauffeur.
Is she into drugs?
No, no drugs.
$1,000, right?
$600 for me.
Julie, don't start this up again.
Look, you want 50-50? You go get Mike.
Or one of those high school dropouts
you like so much.
There's no percentage in it
if I don't get 50-50.
You already cut me out of the repeaters.
It's only fair. Only fair.
It ain't fair, Julie,
but I don't have any choice.
You got a choice.
You got a lot of choice.
You can keep dealing
those retarded faggots
- who don't know class from...
- Look who's talking.
All right. 50-50.
Who'd you drop off up the beach?
Wouldn't you like to know.
Julie, why do you do this to me?
Look, you know anybody else
who gets in the LA Country Club?
And that's not the Hillcrest,
or the Riverside, or the Riviera.
I gotta run now, so why don't you
leave the info on the service?
You don't want to take some sun?
I'm sure the girls
would like some company.
No, thanks. No way. See you later.
How's the Swedish coming?
Okay.
Do you want me to help you?
Listen to the recording
and repeat what you hear.
Listen and then repeat.
I am not interested in that.
How much farther have we to go?
Is this your first visit?
Okay.
Yeah?
Okay, let him through.
Hey, Leon, what's up?
Hey, Julie, baby, listen,
I hate to bug you like this,
but you gotta help me out.
I had this Palm Springs gig
set up for Joey
and the bitch split.
Least he ain't nowhere around.
No, I can't do it.
Getting a haircut now.
I got something on later this afternoon.
Baby, baby, this is a two-hour gig.
- Plus the drive.
- Plus the drive.
Five C's. Straight in-and-out job.
Nothing fancy. Come on.
Do me a favour.
I don't know. Maybe. If I get some time.
I'll give you 50 bucks.
You go fuck yourself.
You think I'm in this for charity?
Hey! Hey, hey, wait a minute, here.
Who's doing who a favour?
Who called who up, begging for a sub?
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I appreciate it.
Anything for a friend.
Excuse me.
Mind if I take my cap off, ma'am?
No, of course not.
Thank you.
I think I know this hotel
better than I do my own apartment.
All the important people
come and stay here.
You know, I used to be a pool boy here.
Anything I can do to help you?
Look, I'll open up
the champagne for you.
- You don't have to open up the...
- Julian. My name is Julian.
You don't have to open the champagne.
I will give you a tip, don't worry.
Oh, Jesus.
Look, I'm sorry, Mrs Dobrun.
That's not what I meant at all. I was...
I'm sorry.
This your first time in LA?
- Maybe you can be a help to me.
- Yeah?
Well, I haven't been here
for several years
and I was wondering if there are
any new really good restaurants.
You know,
where the famous people go?
Yeah, well,
it's probably safer to recommend
the more established restaurants.
There's Ma Maison and La Scala,
and Scandia.
And of the newer ones,
I hear that Le Dome is quite nice.
Very popular.
My, you are making me
thirsty just standing there.
Now you can open the champagne.
Pour me a drink,
and set the bottle down.
Yeah, she liked the pool boy bit.
I'm going to see her again
tomorrow afternoon.
Yeah.
Okay, Anne. Yes. Love you, too.
Paging Mrs Anderson.
- Mrs Anderson, front desk, please.
- Hey, pretty lady.
- Hi.
- Got my other jacket?
- Sure. Here you go, Julian.
- Thanks.
- Good evening, Mr Kay.
- Vince. How are you doing?
Fine. Nice to see you.
Then he has the nerve
to hit on my sister...
- It's not the greatest job in the world.
- Yeah.
- You get to meet people...
- Thank you.
Yeah, I'll have a Scotch on the rocks.
No, he's not.
I told you. He's looking right at us.
What'll it be?
No, that's okay, Jim.
Je m'appelle Julian Kay.
Excusez-moi, Michelle Jost.
Mr Kay would like another drink.
Manhattan. Dry Manhattan on the rocks.
Yes, sir.
- You speak English.
- You speak English.
- You fooled me.
- And you, me.
How long have you been over here
in Los Angeles?
I live here.
You live here? I don't understand.
You wouldn't.
I'm just trying to refresh
my college French.
I usually practise with a friend,
but she's not here yet.
Where are you from?
I was born in Torino,
but I studied at Nantes.
You hardly have any accent at all.
Yeah, I've been travelling too much.
I envy you.
I love to travel.
I used to travel a lot, but my husband's
involved in local politics.
So now I just practise French.
He thinks it's chic
to have a bilingual wife.
I think he's right.
Where are you going?
I made a mistake.
My husband's in New York.
What about your friend?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
You still don't understand.
Understand what?
Who I am.
Who are you?
You don't even understand who you are,
why you're sitting here.
Why are you here?
I've got to go.
All right. Just one thing.
Why did you come on to me?
Like I said, I made a mistake.
I heard you speaking French.
Often in these big hotels,
you run into women
from foreign countries
who may need a translator or a guide.
And they hire you?
Yes.
How many languages do you speak?
Five or six.
Plus the international language.
That's right.
Well, now,
you're something really special,
aren't you?
You're one to talk.
I saw you sitting here. You wanted me
to come over. I came over.
I know what I see.
How much would you have charged me?
As what? Translator or guide?
No.
Just one fuck.
Now, you've made a mistake.
I don't do that.
You don't, huh?
I know what I see, too, Monsieur Kay.
It's been a pleasure talking to you,
Madame Jost.
Don't spoil it. Bonne chance.
Look, mister,
someone's made a mistake here.
I don't do fags.
I didn't mean that.
And I don't do couples, either.
No, no, no. You don't understand.
It's just my wife Judy. Not me.
- Just her.
- Okay.
- But I can watch.
- Of course.
Would you like a drink?
Not yet.
I think I'd like my money now.
Sure. Sure.
- I like to talk afterwards, too.
- Sure.
Hello, Judy.
You're a very sexy lady,
a very good-looking woman.
Very pretty woman.
You're gonna like me.
I can tell.
Because I like you. I like you.
So just relax and close your eyes.
Just relax and let your mind run free.
Don't worry about anything.
I can take care of you.
I know what you want.
That's right. Close your eyes.
Forget about him.
This has nothing to do with him.
This is just you and me.
No, no, no, from behind.
It has to be from behind.
Okay, baby,
just flip over on your stomach.
Just relax. Don't worry.
Leave everything to me,
'cause I'm gonna take care of you.
I'm gonna take care of you.
I'm gonna get you wet.
I'm gonna get you very wet.
I know how to do this.
Now slap her.
Slap that cunt.
Hey, Leon.
- How you doing, Julie?
- All right.
I want to thank you
for helping me out, Julie.
Finally found Joey holed up
with one of his boyfriends,
just banging away, you know how it is.
Dumb bastard.
Hello, Julian.
- Hi. I'll just have a Perrier.
- Okay.
Okay.
You made quite a hit in Palm Springs.
They want you back.
I'm serious.
They want you to come back this week.
I wouldn't take much, you know. It's...
They're regulars for me.
You lied to me, Leon.
It was a rough trick.
I forgot. You got scruples now, huh?
I don't like playing
the same numbers too often.
They get possessive.
I can't be possessed.
That include Miss Anne?
Anne who?
Boy, I don't know why you fool around
with that dumb bitch.
I'll tell you why, Leon.
She's got a job coming up for me
in a week.
Eight grand.
Can you get me that?
All right. All right.
Thanks, hon.
Just trying to warn you, that's all.
I mean, that bitch will sell you out.
But you really care about me, don't you?
Don't you, Leon?
You care.
You know,
you walk an awful thin line, Julie.
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes.
I mean, you're getting awful cocky.
All the rest of the boys are happy
with a car, house in the hills,
but not you.
You got all your rich pussy lined up,
once-a-month tricks,
a dip in the pool, a little tennis,
and orgasm.
I'm just trying to warn you as a friend.
If those bitches ever turn on you,
you're through.
You're sure about that?
They'll cut you out.
Yeah?
Says she's a friend?
Where does she know me from?
Yeah, send her up.
I'm Michelle.
- How did you find me?
- It wasn't hard.
Are you surprised?
What do you want?
I would have thought that you'd live
in a place with thick red carpet,
big circular bed
and mirrors on the ceiling.
Bordello.
This is my apartment.
Women don't come here.
- You're going out?
- Yeah.
Business?
Maybe.
Isn't it a little late?
Isn't it a little late for you?
My husband's still in New York.
I'm alone.
I thought it would be easier.
What did you say?
I said, "I thought it would be easier."
What would be?
To be with you, to procure you.
I told you, you're mistaken.
Why are you doing this to me?
What am I doing?
Embarrassing me.
I'm not embarrassing you.
I can't keep up
this front much longer.
I came here.
I found out who you were,
where you live.
I came here in the middle of the night.
I want to know what
it would be like to fuck you.
I brought money.
What more can I do? I...
I...
I like...
I don't want to know.
Don't say that.
You got me aroused
just thinking about it.
I'm lying here with a hard-on,
it's not even 10:00 yet.
Don't tease me.
Come on, baby, you're just teasing me.
I'll have to hang up
and jerk off right now.
I am.
Yes, I'm touching myself.
You like that, don't you?
Come on, baby. Don't say that.
We're lying here getting aroused,
talking about having more pleasure
than you've had in years,
you got to bring up
some stupid little $1,200 stereo?
How much does your husband make?
What's he worth? What's he worth?
A couple of million?
Of course I could do without it.
I can listen to the radio.
The speaker's cracked.
Lisa. Lisa, listen to yourself.
Just listen to yourself.
Do you hear what you're saying?
Can you hold on a second?
Someone's at the door.
Good morning.
What do you want for breakfast?
Coffee, orange juice, croissant, eggs?
Julian Kay.
Yeah, I want two coffees,
orange juice, croissant...
No eggs.
...one scrambled egg
and a side of cottage cheese.
Lisa, this is really embarrassing.
I'm sitting here with a hard-on,
and there's people all over
and I can't talk to you now.
All right, I'll see you about 5:00.
Bye-bye, love.
So, what do you think?
About what?
Did you make the right decision
to come here last night?
Was it what you expected?
No. It was like really making love.
I'm not used...
That's not what I expected.
Do you remember
what you said last night?
Yes.
Now, if I bid on it, I have to buy it, right?
Right.
Well, now, the one I want is
right over here. There it is!
What does it say?
I saw one just like that in Madam Wu's.
"Jacobean. Late 17th century."
It's estimated at $4,800 to $5,200.
This has been worked on.
There's glue in it.
Yeah.
I don't know.
My guess,
it's gonna go for $5,000, 55 maybe.
It's a great piece,
but it's not a great bargain.
Now, 48, that's a good bargain.
What do you think?
It's perfect for the guest room,
but I don't know.
You know, I saw a George III chest
around here somewhere
going for, like, 22, 23.
It's a lot of money,
but it's a good investment.
Beautiful lines on it.
Probably the best bargain is that
tacky garniture set over there,
if the Japs don't bid it up. What is it?
- Do you see who I see?
- Who is it?
It's Randolph Sloan's widow.
- She's a stockholder in Jim's company.
- Is she still alive?
She's gonna make a beeline
straight for us.
There goes the garniture set.
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.
Come, Lisa, we must face the enemy
before they face us.
Lucille!
How lovely to see you.
Are you buying or selling?
- Just looking.
- How nice.
There is an exquisite
garniture set over there.
Lucille, this is Willem Shoenvelt.
He's helping me redecorate
the guest house.
Great hospitality, madam.
The dress! Look, the dress.
Beautiful dress.
Goes well with the face.
They're both beige.
Willem.
Madam!
- What is going on here?
- I don't know. So sorry.
Willem.
Lisa, we must go, auf Wiedersehen.
- Did you see her face?
- I can't believe you did that!
I wish your husband would come back.
- He has.
- Good.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Do you mind?
What have you been doing?
- When?
- This morning.
Driving around.
I drove to Anaheim,
then I drove to Long Beach.
I pumped my own gas in Long Beach.
Then I drove here.
You know, Michelle,
I'm really not part of your problems.
And I'm certainly not the solution
to your problems.
I brought money.
Don't...
I don't want your money.
I'll buy you something, then.
I'll buy you that stereo.
I got a stereo.
What, then?
Come on.
- What?
- We're going to my room.
Bulgari. You want it?
No.
Good, 'cause you're not gonna get it.
Tell me everything about you.
Right now.
God. Why?
I don't know. It seems important.
We just made love, didn't we?
Yes.
Then you know everything
there is to know.
That's silly. Where are you from?
No. I'm not from anywhere.
I'm from this bed.
Anything worth knowing about me
you can learn from letting me
make love to you.
That's not true.
Why do you sleep with older women?
I prefer older women.
Why?
What's the use of bringing
some high schooler to climax?
Some silly teenager gets wet in the
movies and goes home to masturbate.
No challenge.
It has no meaning.
The other night,
that night I met you at the hotel,
I was with a woman.
Somebody's mother.
Her husband didn't care
about her any more.
This woman hadn't had an orgasm
in maybe 10 years.
It took me three hours to get her off.
For a while there, I didn't think
I was gonna be able to do it.
When it was over, I felt like I'd
done something, something worthwhile.
Who else would've taken the time
or cared enough to do it right?
My God.
These are not the handcuffs
your wife was wearing
when she was killed, Mr Rheiman.
Those we found in the study.
They were in a filing cabinet.
Along with some dildos,
some paddles and some...
You know what I'm talking about.
Listen, your private sex life
is of no concern to me or to the LAPD.
However, the manner
in which your wife was assaulted
suggests the killer was, may have
been, a guest in your home once.
I'll try to keep what you tell me
in the strictest confidence.
However, I'm gonna have to have
detailed information
about you and your wife's sex practices.
The names of the parties, if any,
that were involved. All right?
Sorry. Here you go. And this, too.
So I get the Salvation Army.
Thanks a lot.
Yep.
Mrs Stewart.
Hi, excuse me.
Does Mr Julian Kay live here?
I'm Detective Sunday.
I'm with the Homicide Bureau,
and I'd just like to ask him
a few questions.
What do you want?
You're Mr Kay?
Hello, I'm Detective Sunday.
How are you?
Come on.
Look, I'm walking into Westwood.
Do you wanna talk there?
- Sure.
- I'll pick that stuff up later, Jill.
I'm investigating the Rheiman murder
from the Los Angeles area.
You heard about the case?
Yeah, that's the one
that was in the paper, right?
Yeah.
- Palm Springs.
- Right again.
Yeah, I think I read
something about that.
Yeah, I bet you did.
- You want a cup of coffee?
- Sure.
Listen, we'll sit in the back.
And what were you doing
Tuesday night?
Tuesday.
- Or people.
- Tuesday night, I was...
I was with a friend at a pre-auction
viewing at Sotheby Parke Bernet.
She'll verify that?
We're talking about a woman
of substance here.
- I think she enjoys her privacy.
- I don't want this any more.
...if that's what this is to you, okay?
I don't want it! I don't want it!
Come over here.
You can't mix May and December.
It just...
Yep.
You like cigars?
I'm sorry.
Am I a suspect?
No, no, no, no. But we're gonna
have to check out your alibi
just to be on the safe side,
for your sake.
All right, now, this work that you
were doing for the Rheimans,
was this as a translator or a chauffeur?
Neither. This was...
This was more of a personal matter.
You're friends?
Not exactly.
Not exactly. All right, then.
Then what exactly is it
that you were doing with the Rheimans,
or for the Rheimans?
Nothing special.
Chit-chat. I don't know.
I have a hard time
remembering about these things.
You know, I meet a lot of people.
Yes, yes.
No, I understand your problem.
Let's see now, you got there,
you sat around, you had a few drinks.
Next thing you know, you're back in LA.
Is that right?
More or less.
You want another cup of coffee?
That's bullshit, Julian.
I'm gonna take you in.
It'll be good for your memory.
You seem like a young man
who needs a little self-improvement.
Look, Mr Sunday...
Detective Sunday.
Look, Detective.
I want to cooperate with the police
in any way I can, but these...
These are very delicate matters.
Things that may not fall
under the exact letter of the law.
Publicity's the last thing I want.
I'm not gonna book you, Julian.
And I'm not gonna take away
your chauffeur's licence.
I'm not gonna bring you up on
drug charges. I could do all of that.
Just tell me about the Rheimans.
Please welcome Charles Stratton.
Mac, thank you.
I hope you're having
as good a time as the rest of us,
trying to figure out what this stuff is
on our plates.
But most of all...
Who's that man up there
who's second from...
...I'm happy to have the opportunity
to speak to you in an informal way
about the problems
facing southern California.
More than any other
community in the country...
Do you follow California politics, Julian?
- Not very much.
...we not only use oil and gas...
You're smart. They're all whores.
...more extravagantly
than any other community,
but we also have the technological
means and know-how
to help free America
from the grip of fossil fuels.
In times of austerity like these,
it is the privileged
who should lead the way,
who should set an example
for the rest of the country.
- I believe...
- This guy is a real comer.
...that example.
So, I said, "What happens
when Mike Curb leaves town?"
I'm telling you...
Nice of you to come.
You know my wife, Michelle?
She's pretty, isn't she?
Yes, very.
Jim, good to see you.
Thank you for coming.
You know Michelle.
Glad to meet you.
Mrs Laudner, how nice of you to come.
It's always a pleasure to see you.
It's bullshit, but I like it.
Can we talk later?
Certainly. Mrs Laudner,
my wife Michelle.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- And this is Julian Kay.
- It's an honour to meet you, sir.
I enjoyed the speech.
Mrs Stratton.
You're a fortunate man, Senator.
Well, you know what he is, don't you?
That boy is gonna go far.
Got a nice wife, too.
Tell me about them, Frances.
Well, I told you he's a comer.
No, I want to hear
about them as a couple.
- How is their marriage?
- Julian, you are incorrigible.
No, come on. I mean it.
I wanna hear about it.
I hear she's very unhappy.
How you doing?
...really pretty picture...
- Julian!
- Well, hello.
What a surprise.
You do a lot of shopping here, maybe.
No. I'm just browsing.
Just browsing.
Well, I gotta go now.
Lot of appointments.
It's been very nice talking to you,
Mrs Stratton.
Wait.
I have to talk to you.
Yeah. Me, too.
Want to have a drink?
It's kind of early for a drink.
Maybe we could get to that
in about an hour.
What do you think?
I think you're awful.
I think you're right. Come on.
I've seen your husband on television.
He's very impressive.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing. I'm sorry.
I would never do anything
to hurt him politically.
I could never leave him.
Don't let him blackmail you.
He has this big political thing about
having a family.
He keeps wanting me to be pregnant.
What are we talking about?
Are we talking about
what he wants or what you want?
I can't tell any more.
What can I do?
I don't know.
Be yourself.
Leave him?
His career will survive.
People forget.
These things have to be done quietly.
Don't let him fool you with his talk
about duty and self-sacrifice.
He's getting exactly what he wants.
You've got to do the same.
Take your pleasure when you can.
How about you? Where do you come in?
How do you get pleasure?
What a surprise. Mr Kay.
Detective Sunday.
You are full of surprises.
Come on in. Sit down.
Take a shine. You need it.
Thank you, Julian.
Well, you're quite dressed up today.
Well, I'm going to the country club.
To the country club.
We checked on your alibi.
Mrs Williams said that you had
been with her Tuesday night.
But you dropped her off at 7:00.
The Rheiman murder was at 10:00.
Shit.
But I described the house.
The bedroom.
Yeah, she said you had been
helping her redecorate,
that you had been to Parke Bernet,
picking out a bureau.
- Right. Right.
- I can understand why she'd say that.
She has a reputation to protect.
How do you do it, Julian?
This afternoon with Mrs Jarvie
and tonight at the country club.
How do you seduce
all these women, huh?
I don't like you poking around
in my private life, Sunday,
bugging my friends.
I'll tell you what. You lay off my clients,
I'll give you a few pointers
picking up women, okay?
How's that?
First, obviously, you dress for shit.
Anybody can fix that, no problem.
- It's your face.
- Face?
Face. Bad face.
And your body.
What's wrong with your body?
You have back problems?
You look like a monkey sitting there.
- Come on.
- Hey, back. Shoulders back. Back.
And your jaw, work the jaw.
Exercise. You don't want it slack.
- Up tight, tight. Yes.
- Tight. Tight.
Would you be willing
to come in for a line-up?
Sure. Why not?
Doesn't it ever bother you, Julian?
- What?
- What you do.
Giving pleasure to women?
I'm supposed to feel guilty about that?
But it's not legal.
Legal is not always right.
Men make laws.
Sometimes they're wrong.
They're stupid,
or jealous.
And you know better?
Some people are above the law.
Well, how do these people
know who they are?
They know.
They ask themselves.
Eugene, thanks.
I'll take care of you in a minute.
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.
- May I?
- Please.
Yeah, the other one
could use some work.
Why didn't you tell me
you handcuffed Mrs Rheiman?
I didn't.
Yeah, you said that.
That's why I went back and had it
checked it twice with the coroner.
Apparently, she must have
put up quite a struggle.
There were cuts on her wrists
from being handcuffed.
But underneath the cuts
there were bruises
from where she was handcuffed earlier.
Now the coroner estimates
about 48 hours earlier,
which would be the night
you were there.
Jesus Christ.
Now, she was beaten
with a heavy metal object,
raped and violated with an object,
presumably the murder weapon.
Yeah.
Yeah, I handcuffed her.
But you gotta understand
about these people,
like the Rheimans.
It's like a game to them.
I'll explain.
Julian.
Yeah? What is it?
They were here two hours, the police.
They were here two hours.
I couldn't stop them.
They had a search warrant.
It's all right, Jill. It's okay.
What's going on?
Jill, it's Julian.
No, it's okay. It's okay.
Send the maid up now.
Hi. How you doing, Timmy?
Julian! You're becoming
a regular visitor.
What's happening?
There's something I want
to talk to you about.
I don't like to have anybody
in the house when Tim visits.
Courts might not let me see him at all.
Let's go down to the beach, then.
Watch out.
Thank you.
I think I'm in a frame.
- Who's putting you in?
- I don't know.
All I see is a frame.
It's that Rheiman murder.
Out in Palm Springs.
You tricked with them?
Once. Just once. Favour to Leon.
- Two-timing bastard.
- So I'm a nice guy. I can't help it.
You check around for me?
Why don't you ask
your new friend Leon?
I may just do that!
You trick for other people,
you cheat me out of money,
and then when you need a favour,
you come back to me.
If I help you, you'll have to help me.
How?
You'll have to come back to me,
work strictly for me.
Wait a minute, now.
No, it's got nothing to do with that.
- Like shit it doesn't.
- No.
I made you, Julie.
I taught you everything you know,
how to dress, how to behave,
how to treat women, how to make love.
And then one day
you come to me and say,
"I'm too good for you," and cut me out.
It ain't right, Julie.
Things are different now.
I'm more than what I used to be.
I'm getting older, Anne.
I gotta keep moving forward.
- Just move.
- Please, Julie, save me the speeches.
How's your Swedish coming?
I'll be ready.
She's flying in from Stockholm
on Thursday.
She apparently has certain
sexual idiosyncrasies.
Are you going to come back with me?
You did it, didn't you?
What?
The Rheiman killing.
Don't worry, Julie.
It doesn't matter.
Thank you.
It's been a wonderful evening.
- Can I see you again tomorrow?
- How about this one?
There was a sexy girl
from Borgan Place...
Do you live alone?
It's such a sweet face.
No, not yet.
Why not?
- Let's just kiss some more, okay?
- What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
I just don't want to make love.
I love to be with you.
I love it when you kiss me
and when you touch me,
but when you make love, you go to work.
Look, if it's your period, it's okay.
I don't mind. I love it.
Don't give me that crap.
You know what I'm talking about.
I can't give you any pleasure,
and you can't fool me any more.
You don't know
what you're talking about.
Yes, I do. And so do you.
Yeah, I know.
You're talking about me
giving up what I am,
what I do.
Is that so shocking?
I care about you. I really do.
That's still not enough.
It's all I'm good at.
That's not true.
It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
I can't quit anyhow.
If I quit, I'm out on a limb.
Well, then we'd be even.
I'm already out on one.
People I know take care of each other.
I need their protection.
I'm being framed by somebody.
I don't know who.
There was a murder, Palm Springs,
a couple weeks ago.
Police think I did it.
It was a woman.
A woman I met once.
I wasn't there,
but my alibi completely denies it.
Why would anyone
want to do that to you?
I can't figure that out. I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.
When was the murder?
A week ago Tuesday.
Weren't we together that night?
Baby, I wish we were.
All right, boys, stand full-face, please.
This is bullshit. These cops...
Number three, take off your glasses.
Number two, straighten up.
Turn to your right.
No, number three, to your right.
Jerk.
How much you getting paid?
What are you talking about?
I'm just a con.
So am I.
I'm getting 15.
- You are?
- Yeah, 15 bucks.
Now left, please.
Left.
Thank you.
- The wino's getting 20.
- You're kidding.
You ain't getting paid,
you're getting screwed.
Shit! What the fuck is going on here?
Is my lawyer here yet?
- I want to speak to my lawyer...
- Four!
...when he gets here!
Make sure they call me.
Four. You'll see your lawyer.
Get back in line.
Now, just make sure I speak to him.
Number one, turn to your right again.
I know my rights.
- This isn't Russia.
- Okay, number one, turn to your left.
We have a constitution here.
I know my rights.
- Wait till my lawyer gets here.
- All right, thank you.
You all can leave now.
How about this fucking jerk here, three?
Is he getting paid?
Hey, you!
Are you getting paid, too, huh?
What the fuck is going on?
Well, what do you think?
- Not bad.
- I'm gonna steal your thunder.
He's teaching me how to dress.
This is Lieutenant Curtis
from Palm Springs.
He's...
He's in charge of this case.
Wait a minute. I thought you were.
No, not me. I'm in charge
of pimps, prostitutes and hustlers.
They keep me pretty low on the pole.
Good joke, huh?
You've been identified, Julian.
- Julian.
- By whom?
Who could possibly identify me?
You parked your Mercedes
about 50 feet from the Rheiman house
between 9:30 and 10:00
on the night of the 22nd.
Then you proceeded up the street,
entered the house.
- Someone saw you, Julian.
- I request formal charges...
I don't understand. I don't know
who would say this about me.
- Now, he's been apprised of his rights!
- I was not there.
Then she identified subject number one.
Then she wasn't sure
which one of you it was.
- You got the licence number?
- She didn't see it.
- Shit!
- Right.
Here.
We looked around your house
the other day. We had a warrant.
- We know.
- You recognise these?
No.
- They were under your mattress.
- So what?
They had Mrs Rheiman's fingerprints
all over it. That's so what.
- Did you find the jewels?
- What jewels?
I read the paper, too.
Jewels stolen from Rheiman's house.
Whoever planted that money
probably planted the jewels, too.
There were no jewels.
Didn't you ever wonder
this whole thing may be a frame?
It occurred to us.
It occurred to you.
- Did you check out Rheiman himself?
- He has an alibi.
Big deal, he's got an alibi. What about...
You're grasping at straws.
What about Leon James, the black guy
sent me out to Rheiman's?
He spoke very highly of you.
He said you were a high-class act.
And what do you think?
I think you're guilty as sin.
I think you went to the Rheimans',
I think you did a trick,
played some rough games.
You got drugged or stupid or both.
I think you beat her, you killed her,
stole the money and the jewels.
Then there's no use to talk any more
until you press charges.
Even though we think Julian's guilty,
we're not gonna arrest him.
If you are being framed,
you're gonna be a lot more use to us
floating around.
Can we go now?
Just one more thing, Julian.
Don't tell cons they get paid for line-ups.
Some cops don't have
a sense of humour. You know that.
- Hi.
- Yes?
I'm here to see Mrs Williams.
My name is Julian Kay.
That's all right, Wilma.
I'll take care of it.
- Hi.
- Hello, Julian.
- Why are you here?
- Can I talk to you?
What do you want to talk about?
Were the police here?
There was a detective here.
I was very surprised you used my name.
I'm very, very sorry about that, Lisa,
but this is very important to me.
I told him the truth.
Lisa, you didn't tell him the truth.
I was with you until after midnight.
That's not the truth.
Julian, I can't...
You weren't here.
What is it, dear?
This is Julian Kay,
the one who is helping
with the decorating.
He's the boy who told the police
he was with me the night of that murder.
So, you're Mr Kay.
It's bad enough you made a fool
of my wife at Parke Bernet,
but then you start spreading these lies?
- Leave us alone.
- I wasn't lying.
I don't know what you did.
I don't want to know.
Whatever it is, you're not going
to get out of it by dragging...
Truth. I just came here for the truth.
That's all.
- I know you're lying.
- How do you know I'm lying?
Because I was here with my wife
the entire evening.
Thank you, Mr Kay.
You're really not very good at this,
you know?
- What?
- Following people, pal!
In fact, you're lousy.
Who are you?
What are you talking about?
Who's paying you?
You're not a cop, are you? You can't be.
Leon. It's Leon, right?
- I'm calling the police.
- You want to call? Go ahead, good, call.
You want a dime? I'll give you a dime.
What have we got here?
- Give me that!
- Floyd... Floyd Wicker. Nice name.
Born 7-23-52.
Hawthorne Avenue, LA.
Driver's licence, American Express,
Master Charge, picture of girlfriend...
So-so, eyes too close together, Floyd.
What else have we got here?
We got California State
Congressional Library pass,
California State
identification, California...
State senate pass.
Senator Charles Stratton.
- Who the fuck are you?
- You can read, can't you?
Here.
You work for Senator Stratton?
Yes.
- Why are you following me, Floyd?
- I was told to.
- By who? The Senator?
- Who else?
If the Senator wanted to know
about my private life,
why didn't he ask me himself?
You don't know. You don't know.
Well, I'll tell you what, Floyd,
I'm gonna make this easy for you.
I'm gonna make it real easy,
so you don't forget.
This is my telephone number.
Now you tell the Senator,
if he wants to talk to me,
he can just give me a call, all right?
Now you fuck off and leave me alone!
I received your message, Mr Kay.
- Thought I'd come see you in person.
- Good evening, Senator.
Yes, I'll have a vodka and tonic,
Charles, please.
Yes, sir.
This is heart-warming.
It's nice to see you haven't lost touch
with your constituency.
I'm not talking as a senator now.
I'm talking as a husband.
That's too bad. I'm not a wife.
Very funny.
What do you want?
Want?
I know who you are.
I can't stop my wife from being a fool.
But I can stop her
from being blackmailed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't?
The police think you're involved
in a murder in Palm Springs
a week ago.
Three days later,
you saw my wife at a fundraiser
and seduced her.
You think you can blackmail me
into helping you?
You're crazy, mister.
Am I?
Last night, my wife asked me
about the Rheiman murder.
It didn't make any sense
until I heard about you.
You talked to Michelle about this?
You're not gonna blackmail me!
You can spread...
You don't know
anything about this, Mister.
But I do know a whore when I see one.
How much?
Not to see your wife again?
Five thousand.
You'll have the cash in the morning.
I'm seeing Michelle
because I want to see her
and because she wants to see me.
I don't want a dime from you,
or anyone like you.
Let me be even simpler.
You live off the good graces
of a small number of people.
Like Mrs Andrews,
who was just at the door a minute ago.
And the good graces of places
such as this.
You're just a hanger-on.
Unless you want to find a new crowd
to hang on to,
don't see my wife again.
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- Not bad. How about you?
I'm looking for Leon James.
Is he around?
Yeah. He's probably at the Probe.
Okay. Thanks. Take care.
Hi, Julian.
Hey, Jason.
Julian, I haven't seen you
in a long time here.
What brings you to this
neck of the woods?
I'm looking for Leon.
Have you seen him around?
Leon? Yeah, he was here.
He was showing off his new little boy.
A cute little blond kid.
I think he's over there someplace.
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah.
Hey, Julie! I thought that was you.
Homecoming?
I've been looking for you. I wanna talk.
Let's go out back where it's quiet.
Okay.
What're you doing here?
You coming from a funeral?
I hear you're showing off
a new boy here, Leon.
Got to make sure none of these fruits
snatch him from me, too.
You heard anything
about the Rheiman killing?
That's all I've been hearing about.
Cops on my ass like white on rice.
They're giving me
the third degree, Leon.
Everybody else, too, Julie.
I may need your help.
I don't have an alibi.
You're the one that sent me.
You need one?
Yeah.
I'll see what I can do.
Who do you think killed her?
Well, if I was the police, I'd be more
interested in Rheiman himself.
He's a freak, you know?
Yeah, he's a freak. But he's got an alibi.
An alibi?
Hey, Julie.
I got something working tonight.
Little thing, you know.
I thought I'd cut you in on it.
If you're interested, let me know.
Straight?
At this time of night? Are you serious?
Leon, I'm sick of doing your shit.
I mean, I'm sick of it! No more fag stuff.
No more kink. Nothing. Finito. Got it?
I heard about your problems.
What problems?
Your clientele, Julie. Your rich pussy.
They won't touch you. Say it's too hot.
They're looking for new boys.
Fuck them! Fuck them!
Hey, Julie, listen.
You ask me
to help you out of a tight spot.
I'm glad to do it.
But I ask you to do my trick,
you tell me no.
Well, how do you expect me
to help you?
You give me the alibi,
and then we'll talk about tricks.
I have to talk to you.
Hey, baby! Oh, God!
I'm glad to see you!
You okay? You better be.
You look so worn out.
I didn't get much sleep.
- You wanna go for a walk?
- Yeah.
Okay, let me get my shoes.
What's wrong?
Are you gonna tell me about it?
Hey!
Hey! You.
Come on. Tell me.
When I said I didn't want
to make love to you the other day,
I didn't mean it.
I want to fuck you.
I always want to fuck you.
Is that what you came to tell me?
No.
Charles asked me
to leave for two months.
Till the primaries are over.
I'm going to Rome.
Two months.
I'll be back! Wait for me.
I don't know if I can.
- The police searched my apartment...
- Maybe Charles could help.
Don't... That's not what I'm saying!
I don't know what I'm saying.
All my life I've been
looking for something.
I don't even know what it is.
- Let me do it...
- Maybe you're what I'm looking for.
I gave Charles my word.
I've got to go.
It'll be all right.
Yeah.
I have to leave.
Shit!
I don't know where he is.
I haven't seen him since yesterday.
- Tell me.
- I don't know. Honest. I'd tell you.
The police have been here all morning.
His room's a mess.
There's another cop waiting in his room.
- Does he call in?
- I'm not supposed to tell.
Okay, next time he calls in,
tell him that I've got to talk to him.
Tell him it's important.
Ask him if there's someplace
I can meet him.
Do you know a blond kid
that hangs around
with Leon James?
Nah. Couldn't tell you.
Eat shit, asshole.
Anne, I'm sorry.
I've got to talk to you.
I can't now. I'm looking for somebody.
Perino's? Look, I don't have time! I...
Yeah, all right. All right. Perino's.
Yes. 8:30.
Jill? It's Julian.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Got some messages for me?
Michelle?
Tell her to meet me at Perino's.
Son of a bitch, it's Rheiman.
Mr Julian! You can't come in like this.
I was working. I forgot my tie.
- I'll have to give you a jacket.
- No, it's okay.
Julie. You look like shit. What's wrong?
Everything. Straight bourbon.
What're you doing to yourself?
The way you look now,
you couldn't get a maid to fuck you!
Anne, I need your help.
The cops are after me.
They're framing me
for the Rheiman murder.
Where have you been?
- I was looking for somebody.
- Last night?
- What do you mean?
- Mrs Vakklar.
She came in last night
on a flight from Stockholm.
And she only speaks Swedish.
Nobody could understand her
and there was no one there to meet her.
- Anne...
- She was furious!
The auto people are furious.
Now I've got hell to pay!
Now what happened?
Didn't you prepare?
Didn't you hear me?
I said the cops are after me!
For murder!
So, you stand me up?
Jesus Christ.
What do you want?
Are you gonna help me?
I've checked around, Julie.
You are in trouble!
That's why I need your help.
You never did anything for me.
I never did anything for you...
What are you talking about?
I'm your number one boy!
And you fight me every turn.
You ask a favour, and then stand up
a gig I worked for six months to set up!
I explained that already. I told you.
I'm through with you, Julie.
You'll have to fend for yourself.
I don't care
what happens to you any more.
Excuse me. I'll be back in a second.
Julian. Thank God you got my message.
I've been looking for you all day.
It's all right, baby. It's okay.
No. No, it's not all right.
Charles talked to the D.A.
They've found the murder weapon.
They're gonna arrest you.
That can't be.
What're you gonna do?
I don't know.
What can I do to help you?
- There's nothing you can do.
- There's gotta be something.
Don't you understand?
I am in big trouble!
- Just stay away from me!
- No!
It's gonna be a scandal.
You know what a scandal is?
You know what that's like?
Just stay away from me.
I'll ruin your life.
Your husband's. It's all over.
Not if you're innocent.
If I'm innocent?
How do you know I'm innocent?
- But you are...
- Look at me, right in the face!
Can you tell me, without hesitation,
you know I'm innocent?
Yes.
- You see... Forget me.
- Is someone in there?
I never loved you.
- Julie.
- Let me in. It's important.
Julie, you look terrible.
Hey, listen, you wanna clean up?
Get a shave?
I'm sorry to bug you
this time of the morning.
I've been looking for you.
I'm listening.
You got my alibi ready?
I'm gonna need it today.
It's not ready yet, Julie. Tomorrow.
I'm still piecing it together.
It's not easy, you know.
I'm just trying, you know, to get it right.
- Why are you trying to frame me?
- What're you talking about?
Judy Rheiman's murder.
You're behind it.
You, Rheiman,
your cute little blond boyfriend
in the bedroom there.
The one who planted the jewels
in my car!
I don't know what you're talking about!
You don't know what I'm talking about.
What the fuck is that, then?
He's the one
that actually killed her, isn't he?
Leon, what happened?
You sent him out there.
You sent him out there, he got into
a scene with Rheiman and his wife.
He got rough, and he killed her.
You shut your fucking face!
I never saw that shit before in my life!
Look, I wanna know one thing from you.
How much is it gonna cost me
to get you off my back?
You ain't talking money,
you're talking murder.
- How much?
- I feel sorry for you, Julie.
How much?
It don't make no difference
how much, Julie.
The other side will always pay more.
You got it on real tight, huh?
Real proud of yourself,
aren't you, Leon?
The police found the murder weapon
a block from your apartment.
And that bitch in Palm Springs
is gonna change her mind anytime now
and identify you.
Police want you real bad, Julie.
Now they got you.
Look, I'm worth maybe 20, 30 grand.
It's yours.
I'll break in new boys for you.
I'll work just for you!
Just for you, Leon!
40-60 split.
That's fair. 40-60.
40...
30-70.
I'll do fag tricks for you.
I'll do kink.
I'll do anything you want me to do!
Leave me alone and get out, Julie.
Why me?
Why did you pick me?
Because you were frameable, Julie.
You stepped on too many toes.
Nobody cared about you.
I never liked you much myself.
Now get out.
Who's down there?
Your new boyfriend? You motherfucker!
You...
Oh, my God! Help!
Listen, don't let me fall!
Please, Julie, help me!
- Don't let me fall!
- Don't fall. Leon, I need you!
Give me your hand.
- Try. At least try.
- I can't. I'm trying.
Help me! Help me, please!
God! Don't fall!
Julian, would you
answer a few questions?
How many times
have you been to Palm Springs?
How long were you
seeing Mrs Rheiman?
Any Hollywood notables...
How much money
have you made, Julian?
Go ahead and give me
an exclusive, huh?
Who're you trying to protect?
- How much did you get for a trick?
- Please. Please. Come on, Julian.
Is it true you're getting a plea bargain?
Why would you make a statement?
I wish I had arrested you earlier.
It would have been easier for everybody.
You'd better put an end
to this pre-trial publicity.
We'll be moving him
to Palm Springs soon.
Do you have anything to say, Julian?
Julian?
No.
Hello, Julian.
Going away on your trip?
No, I decided not to.
- Does your husband know you're here?
- No.
Why did you come?
I didn't think
I was ever going to see you again.
Don't come back, Michelle.
Are you satisfied with your lawyer?
It doesn't matter.
Don't go.
Michelle Stratton is paying
for my services, Julian.
I think you know
this is a matter of some secrecy.
Tell her not to bother.
Julian, you'll have to help us more.
You tell Michelle to forget me.
I'm more worried about your defence,
Julian, than about her private life.
We'll have to go into all the details
of the night of the murder.
A maid saw you trying to save Leon,
so the police are only pressing
the Rheiman case.
The papers and TV
are trying you already, Julian.
The police aren't
investigating any more.
We need some help,
some facts to get
the investigation going again.
Then we can find out
about Leon, Rheiman.
Maybe the blond boy.
How about it, Julian?
- Lieutenant Curtis?
- Yes, Mrs Stratton. This is an honour.
May I sit?
I was told you wanted to see me.
What can I do for you?
I want to talk to you about
the Julian Kay/Rheiman murder case.
Yes.
I'm paying for Mr Kay's legal defence.
I know.
I'm paying for Mr Kay's defence
because I know he's not guilty.
And I don't want to see
an obstruction of justice.
How do you know he's not guilty?
Because he was not in Palm Springs
the night of the murder.
- No?
- No.
He was with me.
I told them, Julian.
I heard.
You didn't have to do that, Michelle.
You could have forgotten me.
I'd rather die.
What will you do now?
I don't know.
I can't go home.
The newsmen are waiting
outside for me.
There's dozens of them.
Why did you do it?
I had no choice.
I love you.
Oh, my God, Michelle.
It's taken me so long to come to you.
