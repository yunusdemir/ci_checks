He said
four minutes precisely.
<i>Non, non, non.</i>
Quickly.
Two
perfect eggs this time, no?
Ah.
Hmm.
Maybe.
I blame the chicken.
Why do hens lay eggs
of different sizes?
It's not you, <i>mon ami.</i>
These are two
perfectly good <i>oeufs.</i>
Mr. Poirot...
I've got three religions
bent on riot.
If you're going to perform
one of your miracles,
the time is now.
Have the eggs. <i>Allons-y!</i>
Poirot!
Sorry for the, um...
It is not the, uh...
It is the imbalance of the...
Right.
That's better.
Excuse me.
Coming through.
Make way, please.
Excuse me.
Please call for the accused.
The rabbi...
the priest...
and the imam.
It is like the old joke, yes?
The rabbi, the priest,
and the imam.
Forgive me,
I am Belgian.
So, let us begin.
In the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre above us...
<i>three representatives meet
under the supervision...</i>
<i>of the Chief
Inspector of Police</i>
<i>to discuss a divided timetable
for market use.</i>
<i>One hour after this
tense meeting...</i>
<i>a priceless relic
is found to be stolen.</i>
It is said, one of these
three men has stolen it.
The police find no pieces
of evidence at all.
I find one.
<i>On the meticulously
well-kept wall of a fresco...</i>
<i>a single crack
from an indelicate climb...</i>
<i>with a hard-soled shoe
or perhaps a boot.</i>
So, ladies and gentlemen,
we must ask...
who stands to benefit
from the crime.
Our three holy men
live humbly.
They're thin-soled shoes poor.
Sudden riches
and rubies would be...
too conspicuous, yes,
to enjoy. They do not gain.
At this point, we need an armed
guard at the south gate.
Thank you very much.
No, the only one...
who benefits from the theft
and the unrest it causes...
is a man whose office
I had searched this morning...
as I waited,
I have to tell you,
rather disappointedly
upon my breakfast.
Difficulty with eggs.
You don't need to know this.
A man who is paid lavishly
to keep order in Jerusalem.
I mean, of course,
the Chief Inspector
of the Police.
A man who does not wish
to lose a well-paid post...
when there is discussion
among the local peoples
of self-governance...
who does wear boots, and who,
I believe, now does regret...
inviting me to
consult on this case.
How dare you accuse me!
Please, Sergeant...
did you search
the office as I asked?
Uh, yes, sir.
And did you find
what I said you might?
Uh, yes, sir.
Just as you said.
<i>Merci.</i>
Halt!
You need
to deliver that, Captain.
It should be through
first thing in the morning.
Very good, sir.
Luggage is on board, sir.
I won the right to escort you
to your boat.
To Stamboul, then?
Will you be back
to London straight off?
I am tired, and I have earned
myself a little holiday.
I want to look at paintings
and have too much time
on my hands.
You are staring.
Does it stop?
It's just...
How did you know
it was him, sir?
From just a tiny crack
on the wall.
I have the advantage...
I can only see the world
as it should be.
And when it is not,
the imperfection stands out...
like the nose
in the middle of a face.
It makes
most of life unbearable.
But it is useful
in the detection of crime.
But it's as though
you see into their hearts
and divine
their true natures.
And whatever people say,
there is right,
there is wrong.
There is nothing in between.
We must part here.
Oh, no, sir, I'm to
escort you on the ferry.
<i>Au revoir, mon capitaine.</i>
We must never meet again.
Could you straighten your tie,
please? Just a little.
- Yes.
- That is perfect.
Final passengers, please!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Will be fixed soon.
But, will it be
fixed in time?
We are working!
I have a connection
in Stamboul.
Leaves tomorrow at seven.
There's a very ill patient
waiting for me in London.
I am a doctor.
Doctor.
I am a doctor.
I am shouting at you
in English,
and now I'm doing it
louder and slower.
Very silly, forgive me.
May I help? Let me help.
I know your mustache.
From the papers.
You're the detective,
Hercules Poirot?
Hercule Poirot. I do not slay
the lions. <i>Mademoiselle.</i>
Mary Debenham, <i>monsieur.</i>
I'll forget a name
but never a face.
Not yours, anyway.
You come from Baghdad?
It's true. No detail
escapes his notice.
- Your ticket.
- Ah.
I might also ask you if you
enjoyed your time there...
as a governess?
The chalk on your sleeve
and the geography primer.
A governess or a cartographer.
I made my gamble.
I always begin them
with geography...
and monster them till they
have the world down cold.
They may get lost in life...
but I'll be damned if they
don't know where they are.
Well, our chains are free.
Right on time.
I feel so free
out here on the water.
I wish I could enjoy it.
We should be
out of this, Mary.
Not now.
When it's all over.
When it's done.
Then, nothing can touch us.
<i>Ah,
my holiday begins here.</i>
I can see the soul of the city
in these humble breads.
The world insists
on destruction, yet here...
masterpieces are baked
to order every day.
Monsieur Poirot!
Mohammed!
Mohammed, my friend...
you are an artist.
Ah! My friend!
Sorry.
Here. Come, come.
Don't mind us,
we're just looking
for a place to have
a private argument.
It should take
some 20 minutes or so...
at which point we will both
come to an agreement,
or at least I will.
<i>Monsieur</i> Bouc!
Poirot! In the kitchen?
Well, of course,
this man will sniff out
a perfect pastry
faster than he catches...
a jewel thief.
<i>Mon ami!</i>
Now, I am no longer
a policeman.
I cannot bail you out
when this goes badly, eh?
This is my dear, old friend,
the esteemed...
Poirot, who I knew
before the esteem.
Hercule Poirot, this is...
- A prostitute.
- She is.
I am. Bouc, you did not tell
me you had famous friends.
We're friends because
I'm the only person
who never asks him...
any questions about his cases,
because I don't care.
And he never judges me
for being a terrible person.
Indeed you are.
<i>Madame,</i> Bouc, please join
me for a drink, yes?
You only have me
for an hour.
I ride on the Orient Express
at seven,
official director business.
Uncle pays me absurdly
to stay onboard
his gorgeous train...
and far away from him...
at the home office...
consigned to wine and dine
handsome officials
for all eternity.
There is an art to nepotism.
And you are
its Michelangelo!
Mr. Poirot.
Are you a prostitute as well?
Certainly not.
Is this man bothering you?
He is about to.
You are from
the British consulate.
- I am, sir.
- It is the Kassner case.
Why, yes.
I was correct
in certain predictions?
Quite.
I do not need
to read the telegram.
Oh, how fun.
Did someone cheat, or die?
Unfortunately, both.
Someone has...
interrupted my
longing for rest.
It appears that I must travel
with you tonight, Bouc.
Can you find me a cabin
on the Orient Express?
My friend...
I may not be good for much,
but I sure as hell
can get you a bed
on my train...
in the dead of winter.
Three days...
free of care, concern
or crime. You will love it.
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> it has
been a pleasure. Sir.
Your luggage
has been collected
and your expenses paid.
You will be met at Calais...
and then escorted to Dover,
and then by rail
to London Victoria.
I would like to formally
- express gratitude.
- Please, don't speak.
You make it worse.
- Here's a tip for you, pal.
- Thank you, Mr. Marquez.
I didn't even carry
your luggage.
Oh, I had a good week.
We celebrate
when fortune smiles,
and we share
the good fortune.
Remember to say nice things
about us Americans, huh?
No!
Hey, stop!
<i>Monsieur, bonsoir.</i>
For you, Mr. Ratchett,
the best table in the house.
Just here, sir.
The very best table.
No, I want that one.
Hey, Masterman.
You got everything?
Kind of you to inquire,
Mr. MacQueen.
I do not make mistakes.
Oh, my goodness!
It's Count Andrenyi.
Come, come, come.
I saw you dance
at the Monte Cristo.
Could I take your photograph?
Please, my face, no!
Sorry.
The Simplon Orient Express...
with stops in Sofia, Ni≈°,
Belgrade, Vinkovci, Brod...
with transfers
to Bucharest, Zagreb,
Trieste, Venezia,
Milan, Lausanne...
Dijon, Paris,
Boulogne, Calais...
with connection
to Dover and London,
leaves in fifteen minutes!
This way, Michel!
Precious cargo.
I need
a first-class compartment.
Give special care
to my friend, Michel.
I want him pampered
like a zoo panda.
But <i>Monsieur</i> Bouc,
we are fully booked.
There's no space left.
Then we make space.
He can have the number eleven.
The eleven is always kept
open for official use.
It's very comfortable.
Eleven is taken.
The Austrian professor
booked it two days ago.
There is not one first-class
sleeper car
on the whole train?
Negative, sir.
Second-class?
There's no space left at all.
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Debenham.
Mr. Poirot,
are you joining us?
It depends
who wins this debate.
Have all the passengers
arrived?
All but one. Mr. Harris.
"All passengers
must check in
"at least one half hour prior
to time of departure...
"or their seat
may be forfeit."
The half hour has passed.
The seat is forfeit.
Please take
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot's luggage
to number three
with Mr. MacQueen.
<i>- Merci,</i> Bouc.
- Enjoy, my friend.
- Welcome, sir.
- <i>Merci.</i>
Number three is unlucky.
Oh!
Apologies, <i>madame.</i>
I meant no disrespect.
Well, you could try to mean
a little.
One thing about train travel,
you're always
knocking into somebody.
It's wonderful.
Though, I am looking forward
to getting back.
Travel is fine for spicy food,
mosques, meeting men.
But eventually, you just
miss your own bed.
I've been accused
of husband hunting abroad.
Well, I can't,
in all honesty, deny it.
I like my time alone, I do.
But a lady has certain needs
that deserve to be met
if she has any money...
and preferably,
on a regular basis.
Oh!
Oh, my!
Fire in the kitchen!
Farewell, <i>madame.</i>
Good evening.
<i>Bonsoir.</i>
Number nine.
- Good evening.
- <i>Bonsoir, bonsoir.</i>
How you doing?
<i>Bonsoir.</i>
Oh. <i>Excusez-moi.</i>
No, after you.
<i>Merci, merci.</i>
Ah number three.
You are Mr MacQueen?
Yeah. I think you might
have the wrong berth.
Uh...
Sorry, is there a problem sir?
No, no problem.
The train is full.
I think that we are,
how do you say... "bunkies."
Really?
I am equally disappointed
in you. This is nice.
Come along, darlings.
No.
No.
This?
Why am I not yet unpacked?
Five minutes to departure.
Final call for passengers!
Shall we brush you?
What the hell
is taking them so long?
Soon as we get out of here,
have them make up the bed.
It's already arranged,
Mr. Ratchett.
No, I want the bed made.
And bring my Dictaphone.
Dogs on the table.
Most disgusting thing
I've ever seen in my life.
- Yes, sir.
- I want you to get MacQueen...
and have him bring every
receipt from the Milan sale.
- I want you to get it done.
- Yes, sir.
I want you to get it done now.
- Did I say get it done now?
- Right away, sir.
"Better watch yourself."
Your coffee, Mr. Ratchett.
Who did this?
I can't say, sir.
Good evening,
Mrs. Hubbard.
Hello there,
Mr. Masterman.
Well, hello.
Eyes linger any longer,
I'll have to charge rent.
I'll pay.
Mmm. Have another drink.
Are you insulted?
Hmm. Disappointed.
Some men have a good look.
All they have to do is...
keep their mouth shut,
and they can take home
any prize they want.
Still, the mouth opens.
Is everything all right,
Mrs. Hubbard?
You have a strong intuition,
I know.
My second husband
used to say just so.
Hold that, it was my first.
Yeah.
Brightest man I ever met.
Face like a turnip,
but I loved that turnip.
It was nice to talk.
Good night.
Monsieur Poirot?
<i>Entrez,</i> Pierre Michel.
<i>Voil√†.</i>
When you take supper...
I will move <i>Monsieur</i> MacQueen
into <i>Monsieur</i> Bouc's
compartment.
You travel first class,
<i>monsieur.</i>
<i>Ah, impeccable. Merci.</i>
<i>Bon app√©tit.</i>
...and the eggs?
Good afternoon.
Ah, Mrs. Hubbard.
Good afternoon.
There we are.
Compliments
of the Orient Express.
Thank you, Mr. Bouc.
I am here
for all of your needs.
No, thank you.
I do not drink.
It does not
agree with you?
Sin does not agree with me.
Vice is where the devil
finds his darlings.
We should no longer speak.
Good afternoon.
<i>Monsieur.</i>
How about a <i>ap√©ritif</i>?
I regret I have
an appointment
with the director
of the train.
He was gonna leave anyway.
Please, sir.
<i>Madame, madame.</i>
<i>Madame, madame.</i>
All settled in?
- Ah, <i>merci!</i>
- As advertised.
And yet, the best things
on the train are not food.
You know
there's something about...
a tangle of strangers
pressed together
for days on end,
with nothing in common...
but the need to go
from one place to another...
then never to see
each other again.
Boredom plus
anonymity plus a...
constant, gentle rocking.
With your hobbies, you will
never amount to anything.
- God, I hope so.
- Hmm.
Order me the fish.
Um, exchange grouper for sole,
escarole for the potato,
and...
the beef sauce
for the velout√©.
<i>Gar√ßon,</i> that sounds superb.
The same for me.
The Princess Dragomiroff.
You know, if I ever were
to marry for money,
I'd marry for
that much money.
I brushed Dalia this morning.
No, you tortured
my darling doggy.
I asked you to brush her.
Are you still enjoying
your Dickens?
Very much, <i>mon ami.</i>
You know, with your books
and your capers,
you are missing out
on romance.
Romance never
goes unpunished.
There was, uh...
There was someone once.
I would prefer, in the future,
to be sat not with that man.
Like should be seated
with like.
We are not alike.
Not all of us
are so concerned
with the separateness
of races, Professor.
It is out of respect
for all kinds
that I prefer
to keep them separate.
To mix your red wine
and the white
would be to ruin them both.
I like a good ros√©.
Hey, how you doing?
Would you mind...
if I joined you?
Dessert is an indulgence...
and I feel kinda silly
and stupid indulging alone.
I am at my happiest alone.
But...
for a small piece
of your fragelit√©,
please join me.
Oh, with pleasure.
Excuse me, another fork?
I've been trying to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Poirot.
<i>Merci.</i>
I never ever sat so close
to fame before.
No, I tell a lie.
Once, I was on a bus
with Ty Cobb.
- Ball player, Detroit.
- Ah.
Would you mind if I have the
little curly bit at the top?
You're an odd bird there.
You're a strange,
peculiar man.
I am of an age
where I know what I like
and what I do not like.
What I like,
I enjoy enormously.
What I dislike,
I cannot abide.
For instance,
the temporary pleasantries
before what is determined
to be a business discussion.
You're fun.
All right.
I would like
to offer you a job.
"The avenger of the innocent."
It's what they call you
in the papers.
And you are an innocent?
I'm a businessman.
I'm an art dealer.
I mean, I'm new to it.
But my beginner's luck
has panned out.
Relics, antiquities.
Rugs, weird. Orientals.
I'm new to the game,
so I got the amateur eyeball.
But I got a little problem
with these, uh...
so-called appraisers.
You can't trust
a one of 'em.
Some of my customers...
they buy a piece...
they find out that they're
not exactly original...
which is hardly my fault...
if a Kashan silk scarf
is a fake.
Right? Huh?
<i>C'est bon.</i>
But I've managed to make
a few enemies, is the thing.
I got a few letters,
people making threats.
I think, most likely,
it's the Italians.
I sold them a set of
Oriental carpets in Milan.
And the buyers weren't
so happy with the provenance.
And they want their money back
with interest, you know?
Italians.
A guinea's a guinea.
And then comes along
the genius detective.
Me?
- Yes, you. Hercules Poirot.
- Hercule.
Um...
Here's what I'd like to do.
I would like to hire you
to watch my back...
until I get someplace safe.
It's easy money for you.
And it's peace of mind
for me, you know?
- I understand.
- Good.
I refuse.
I'm sorry? That's bad.
Maybe I didn't make
myself clear enough.
You see,
someone's out to get me.
And I know I'm not the best
guy born, not by a long shot.
And if there's a world
after this one,
I will face judgment
just like you.
But...
I ain't in no goddamn
rush to do it.
- You're holding a gun on me?
- No.
Not you. On the world.
I exist in the world.
Do not point a gun at me.
How's ten thousand
sound for a week?
It's a generous offer,
Mr. Ratchett. I must decline.
Fifteen thousand?
You didn't hear me. I decline.
Oh, I get it.
It's not flashy enough for the
great Hercules Poirot, huh?
No flashbulbs...
You sell fakes to gangsters.
You're suffering
the consequences.
I detect criminals.
I do not protect them.
So you say "no"
to my dirty money.
I say "no" to you,
Mr. Ratchett.
Business with the gun, right?
Is that what it was?
It is far more personal
than that.
I do not like your face.
If you will excuse me.
You liked my cake,
didn't you?
The cake was excellent.
Have a pleasant afternoon,
Mr. Ratchett.
Thank you.
Ooh! Cold.
Hmm.
My sweet Katherine.
My love.
Mr. Dickens.
Mr. Ratchett?
Mr. Ratchett?
It's nothing.
Very good sir.
Good night.
Mrs. Hubbard?
It's always Mrs. Hubbard.
Mrs. Hubbard.
Did we die?
Ladies and gentlemen,
the train has been derailed.
Are you all right,
Mr. Marquez?
I'm fine. Thank you.
You'll be
safest in your cabins.
Mr. Bouc will speak
to you all...
in the morning.
Please, you will be safest
in your cabins.
Of course.
Are we gonna die?
Oh...
My Katherine.
My beautiful...
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am afraid
that our train is still
unable to go anywhere.
Yeah, except down.
How long are we supposed
to just sit here?
Yes, someone must
be doing something.
Of course I am doing
something. I am doing nothing.
Precisely two hours
and ten minutes ago,
<i>when we did not arrive
in Brod as scheduled...</i>
<i>the station master will have
surmised our situation...</i>
<i>and already dispatched a team
to excavate the engine...</i>
<i>clear our path,
and send us on our way.</i>
<i>Until then, I assure you...</i>
we will all be made warm
and fed and comfortable.
We could walk.
We could die
of exposure trying.
I have a connection to make.
My boat sails day after
tomorrow from France.
Without you, I'd wager.
Or me in London.
I hold you accountable for
my loss of time, Mr. Bouc.
Madam, you cannot hold me
accountable for the weather.
Of course I can.
You're the one here.
And my conference
in Turin?
And I was to meet at
the auto factory in Sochaux.
Yes, some things,
they are in God's hands.
It is not for us to say...
if we deserve to arrive safely
at our destination...
or if, like Lucifer,
we must fall.
Breakfast for you,
Mr. Ratchett.
Ah, <i>Bonjour,</i>
Mr. Masterman.
There is a problem?
I can't say, sir.
Mr. Ratchett?
Excuse me.
That is cold air.
Please bring Monsieur Bouc
immediately,
and also Dr. Arbuthnot.
Good God!
Touch nothing else,
only the body.
My God,
this is horrible.
First the snow, now...
I'll have to meet
with the police
and make some statement
in some grimy station.
And a man has died.
And a man has died.
He was stabbed.
Long, straight-edged knife.
Multiple stab wounds,
some shallow,
some cut clean through muscle.
Left-hand side
or right-hand side?
That's the thing.
It appears the killer
maybe closed his eyes
and struck blind.
Can you estimate
the time of death?
It's hard
to say with the window open...
but my best guess
is between midnight and 2:00.
But no one went
in his compartment then.
I sat in my seat all night.
I would have seen if someone
went in. It's impossible.
Thank you, Doctor. Please,
return to the dining car.
Michel, secure this carriage.
Poirot.
I need your help, my friend.
You have to find
who did this.
Please, I implore you,
on behalf
of the Orient Express.
When the police arrive,
we can present them
with the case closed.
You are the only one
who can save me.
Your faith touches me,
<i>mon cher.</i>
But I must have this rest.
Well, think of it as a little
beachside puzzle.
That's nothing to your mind!
You look up the antecedents
of the passengers.
You establish
their bona fides.
Then you do what you do.
You... You... You...
You sit in a chair
and you eat your cake...
and you think until
the solution presents itself.
What else are you going to do
while we sit here in the snow?
Without constant
stimulation,
your little gray cells
will starve and die.
You think that is what I do?
I sit in a chair...
and I have
a little piece of cake,
and then I come up
with a great idea?
- I don't know what you do.
- I have my Dickens.
Damn your Dickens!
If we leave this
to the police,
they will choose a culprit...
right or wrong,
and they will hang him.
Most probably Mr. Marquez...
for no other reason
than his name is Marquez.
Or Dr. Arbuthnot for
the color of his skin.
You are the only one
who can bring justice.
Let me have a map
of this coach.
Of course.
- Every passport.
- Anything.
Interviews arranged
with all of our passengers.
Evidence, order and method,
until one culprit emerges.
I do not approve
of murder, my friend.
Every day, we meet people
the world could
do better without...
yet we do not kill them.
We must be better
than the beasts.
So let us find this killer.
What's going on?
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to, um...
It appears that our bad luck
has worsened.
That is...
A passenger has died
on the train.
<i>Monsieur</i> Ratchett.
Looks like they
got him after all.
You assume
he was killed?
No, no.
I just mean he was
in perfectly good health.
He had his enemies,
that's all.
Indeed, he did.
He was murdered.
Good God. Murder, here?
Alas, <i>madame.</i>
God rest his soul.
Someone was rummaging
around my cabin
in the middle of the night.
Nobody would believe me.
What is going on?
As we are snowbound,
I have elected
to take the case...
and find for my friend,
<i>Monsieur</i> Bouc, the criminal.
And why you?
My name is Hercule Poirot...
and I am probably the greatest
detective in the world.
I will speak
to all of you in time.
For the moment...
I must recommend
that you remain
in your compartments
with the doors locked.
I feel like a prisoner here.
It is
for your own safety.
If there was a murder...
then there was a murderer.
The murderer is with us...
on the train, now.
The doors between coaches
were locked at night, hmm?
Absolutely.
Done myself.
The train's
been searched.
There's no one hiding
on it or under it.
We can therefore
limit our investigation
to the occupants
of the Calais coach.
Bouc, you will assist me.
As the only traveler
who slept in another coach...
you are the only one
who is not a suspect.
Mr. MacQueen, is this
really the time for drinking?
My boss is dead.
I'm out of a job,
and you're looking at me
like I did it.
We make no accusations.
You knew him,
so from here
we must glean
the essential facts.
Were you his relative?
No, his secretary.
Book his travel,
order his steaks.
The man ate more steak
than I've ever seen
in my entire life.
He was in antiques.
He had no qualification
for it,
not the eye
or the languages.
Truth is, he had no head
for business, accounting...
none of it.
I took care of everything.
How long were you
in his employ?
Twenty days shy of a year.
Prohibition
wasn't to my taste...
so I found myself overseas,
and in debt.
I'm a lawyer by education...
not disposition.
I was downright awful at it.
You were fond of him?
I was fond of his money.
Ratchett was crude...
<i>demanding, insulting,
and most likely a felon.</i>
<i>When did you
last see him?</i>
<i>It must have been
just after 10:00.</i>
He called me in to go
over our sales in Italy.
Milan,
the sale of forgeries?
Yeah, yeah.
He wanted to look over
the accounts.
I had to translate
everything...
as the contracts
were in French
and he didn't speak a word.
<i>And when we stopped
at Vinkovci...</i>
<i>I struck up a chat with
the colored doctor, Arbuthnot.</i>
<i>And we had a couple of drinks,
stretched our legs.</i>
<i>He had some...</i>
odd opinions about Stalin
I had to turn around.
I don't hold
a man's race against him,
but I don't often
take to Britishers.
When did your party end?
He left just after 2:00.
Did you know
of any specific enemies
Ratchett might have had?
Gosh.
Pick a number.
He confided
he had been threatened?
He got a couple
of nasty letters.
I have them if you like.
Some, anyway.
He tore up the rest.
Threw them into the fire.
That's them.
<i>Merci,</i> Mr. MacQueen.
Uh, thank you.
If we have
any further questions,
we will call for you again.
Have you considered
the Latin man?
Marquez. Hell of a guy.
And, well, you know,
his kind...
they don't have
the same distaste for murder,
historically speaking.
You said you don't hold
a man's race against him.
I suppose...
depends on the race.
And he was doing so well.
- You think it's MacQueen?
- Too early to say.
I admit, I cannot see him
stabbing a man twelve times
in a frenzy.
Not sober, anyway.
Who did it then?
I do not know yet.
It is time we ask.
- Ask who?
- The victim.
He has
twelve stab wounds
and, as Arbuthnot said,
they are patternless.
If the doctor is guilty...
he certainly did not
let it influence
his responsibilities.
Hey, the watch.
Stopped at 1:15.
Now that agrees with the
doctor on the time of death.
Hmm. It is possible,
yes. Certainly possible.
I don't
quite understand.
I do not understand,
myself.
I understand nothing at all.
If you look
at these two wounds...
they are powerful and deep,
and yet there is little blood.
But this was
a frenzied attack.
Lashing here and there.
No pattern at all,
just extreme violence.
And during all this,
our victim,
vigorous and anxious
and full of coffee...
merely lies still and accepts
death without struggle...
when he also has here...
the means by which
he might defend himself.
For you.
Now, let us see here.
Barbital. The Mickey slipped.
Drugged him
so he couldn't use this.
And later around here,
a lady's handkerchief.
An <i>objet de luxe,</i> handmade.
Boom, two hundred francs
in Paris.
And she even has
an initial, "H."
And our little friend,
- the pipe cleaner.
- Another clue.
Yes, a riot of clues
dropped most conveniently.
Yet only one appears, however,
to be perhaps genuine.
And maybe
this ashtray provides
the accidental breadcrumb.
A charred fragment of a note.
An attempt, perhaps,
to burn evidence.
<i>Merci, monsieur.</i>
We may borrow
your equipment, yes?
Thank you.
<i>Merci, merci.</i>
Now,
I prefer to understand...
why a clue is left rather than
what the object is.
We seek the truth from
within, not without.
In this case, however,
I may welcome a little
scientific assistance.
You will adjust the flame.
It's just another one
of those nasty letters.
You are mistaken, <i>mon ami.</i>
This one has a secret to tell.
Look.
"As a strong blood
is on hand, you will die."
What does this mean?
Come with me, Bouc.
Let us fill in the gaps.
This was never
a beachside puzzle.
I know the dead man's
real name.
It is not Ratchett,
but Cassetti.
I know that name.
Then you will also know
the name Armstrong.
<i>The Armstrong case?</i>
<i>The story
shocked the world.</i>
<i>Two years ago...</i>
<i>the renowned pilot,
Colonel John Armstrong...</i>
<i>and his wife, Sonia,</i>
<i>woke to find their
only child, little Daisy...</i>
<i>taken from her crib
as she slept.</i>
<i>Desperate...</i>
<i>the Armstrongs
paid the ransom.</i>
<i>But soon after,
Daisy was found murdered by...</i>
<i>Ratchett,
who was Cassetti.</i>
<i>Sonia Armstrong
was with child</i>
<i>when she received the news.</i>
<i>The shock sent her
into premature labor.</i>
<i>Neither she
nor her baby survived.</i>
<i>How do you know this,
Poirot?</i>
Because John Armstrong
told me so himself.
He wrote to me to ask me
for my help.
By the time
I received his letter...
it was too late.
<i>He was found dead
of a gunshot wound.</i>
<i>Self-inflicted.</i>
"Daisy Armstrong's blood
is on your hands.
"You will die for it."
Indeed, you did.
- <i>Monsieur</i> Poirot?
- Yes, Michel.
Mrs. Hubbard wants
to speak to you.
I held her as best as I could.
Ah, Mrs. Hubbard,
I'm sorry to have kept you.
You have a head full of steam
and a mouth full of words.
You're goddamn right, I do.
What I have been trying...
to tell you all day.
The murderer was in
my compartment last night.
I thought I'd be killed.
Turns out I might have been...
only he got Ratchett instead.
I woke up in the dark,
and I knew
there was a man in my room.
You are certain
it was a man?
I know what it feels like
to have a man in my bedroom.
I told your conductor,
and he wouldn't believe me.
I said, "Check the
communication door
"between my room
and Ratchett's.
"He must have
left through there."
Sure enough, it was unbolted.
I know I locked it...
after what Ratchett said.
He made a rather
overt overture.
Have you perhaps...
heard of
the Armstrong kidnapping?
You couldn't avoid it.
Morbid stuff.
The child's murderer,
Cassetti...
died last night.
Ratchett was the man.
I told you, I knew he was
a rotten one.
You do believe me...
about the man in my room?
I'm aware you think
I'm a silly woman.
But I have proof it's true.
It is
from the uniform...
of an Orient Express
conductor...
but it might have
fallen from Michel's
when he was in your room.
I'm not missing any.
I found it
at the foot of my bed,
on the cover...
right where I slept.
What do you call that?
I call it evidence. Thank you
so much, Mrs. Hubbard.
Have you ever
been to America?
Once.
Years ago, briefly.
For what purpose?
- To confirm a suspicion.
- Which was?
That I wouldn't like it.
I was offered
a post in Boston.
Saw Boston,
went straight back to London.
Is that where
Ratchett was from?
- Boston?
- I can't says I know.
It wouldn't be proper...
to ask.
Carry on.
I last saw...
Mr. Ratchett at nine o'clock.
I brought his coffee
and hung up his clothes.
You have a toothache, I think.
I've got an extraction booked
in London this week.
Mr. Ratchett insisted on not
putting it off any longer.
He said
he was tired of hearing
my suppressed groans.
This sympathetic Ratchett...
was it his usual practice
to drink coffee at night?
Not at all. But he'd been
very agitated lately.
Said he wanted to stay alert,
especially so last night.
He found a letter
in his compartment.
Please tell me
you didn't do this.
If I were to leave
something unpleasant
on your pillow, sir...
it would not be a letter.
Coffee.
<i>Surely, such a...</i>
proper and precise valet...
would never speak
to his master as you did?
Unless he knew his career
was coming to a sudden...
end.
No mere toothache, I think.
The lungs?
The thyroid.
Spread now to stomach.
Same as got my father,
five years younger.
Months at best.
"Inoperable, I'm afraid,"
said the doctor.
And suddenly,
I wasn't... afraid.
I would only do what
I wanted from here on.
I speak my mind now.
The coffee.
It appears that his cup
was laced with barbital.
You, of course,
will tell me
that you did not
put it in there.
Of course I didn't.
When and from where
did you procure
the coffee and the cups?
In the kitchen, sir.
I ordered it at dinner to be
ready at 9:00, and so it was.
Anybody could have got
a hold of it before me.
<i>Merci.</i>
Mr. Masterman.
I'm sorry about the toothache.
<i>Merci.</i>
I love the little cakes.
So, Miss Pilar Estravados,
you are a missionary...
but you trained as a nurse
before you changed
professions, yes?
I owed it to God.
You owed Him a debt?
There were...
indulgent times in my life...
when I took more than I gave.
<i>Gerhard Hardman.</i>
Professor of engineering.
It is science
that will win back
for Germany her pride.
- Biniamino Marquez.
- Mr. Marquez.
Listen, I wanna be clear
of any association
with the crime...
so please ask me anything.
Anything. I never lie anymore.
Did you leave your compartment
at all last night?
Only once, to get an aspirin.
Mrs. Hubbard offered me
something earlier.
I declined at first,
but when I couldn't rest...
I went to ask for it.
My conference is in Turin.
I am the only Austrian
to present,
which means without me...
the talks will
be substandard.
Then I escaped prison,
and I bribed myself
into the US...
where I swore never
to lie or steal again.
You see, my friends,
because when people
trust you, they buy more.
The Italians are cows.
The Spaniards, sheep.
The Belgians...
I come to my room,
which I share
with the unhappy
English butler.
A fish. He groans a lot.
But I'm sure he saw me sleep
all night until morning.
I should say...
in case it is relevant...
there was
an embarrassing moment.
When I went to see
Mrs. Hubbard...
first, I opened
the wrong door.
Oh, sorry.
<i>What time was this?</i>
<i>That must have been about...</i>
Don't be sorry.
...twenty minutes to 11:00.
This is interesting.
As far as it is known,
you are the last person
to see Ratchett alive.
- Your business?
- Automobiles.
I have three showrooms.
I come to America
with nothing. And now...
If what you say is true,
Miss Debenham
will confirm it.
But it is true.
I would not lie.
May it be possible
that Miss Debenham
left your compartment
without you noticing?
No. I sleep very lightly.
The slightest sound
and I bolt upright.
I was surprised once.
Never again.
No, I didn't say
I was a chauffeur.
The photographs that
spilled out of your luggage...
there was a beautiful one
with a little boy
wearing a chauffeur's hat...
visiting his papa at work.
Who did you chauffeur?
Miss Estravados,
why do your hands
have the calluses
of a boxer?
I do my work
in dangerous cities...
where I cannot
be governed by fear.
I trained to fight.
But you do not trust
your god anymore...
since your surprise?
No, in case He is busy.
God is always busy.
<i>It's Masterman.</i>
A man dying is a man
with nothing to lose.
Bravo, Bouc. Except for
the problem of Mr. Marquez...
who has now confirmed
that his bunkmate,
Masterman...
was reading in his bed
at the time of death.
If it were easy, I would
not be famous. Next.
<i>Miss Debenham...</i>
you do not mind
to brace the air?
For you, we have the picnic.
While you made my roommate
suffer cramped quarters.
I see.
Choose the best location
to extract the truth
from each suspect.
Put her off-balance
and me, freeze.
Clever.
Will you write down
your full name
and address, please?
A pale mauve, by the way.
Miss Estravados told me
you asked
the color
of her dressing gown.
<i>Merci.</i>
"Mary Hermione Debenham."
Do you ever go by Hermione?
A constant Mary, when I'm not
employed as Miss Debenham.
Left-handed.
Unusual, I know.
You mustn't have
your theory fixed
if you're testing
my handwriting.
What did you think
of the dead man?
Uh, I can't say
I did think about him.
I don't quite see
the point of your question.
Oh, forgive me, <i>mademoiselle,</i>
my little originalities.
Human nature is perverse
in its complexity.
To plumb it,
it takes the right tools.
These are toys,
not tools, Hercule.
I prefer you put them away.
The direct method? <i>Parfait.</i>
You knew the doctor
before traveling?
Dr. Arbuthnot?
No.
But such instant attraction?
We are not in America...
Miss Debenham.
There are no laws
against what you may feel.
Nor are there laws
against silence, of which...
I hold my...
I've never been to America.
Perhaps I may ask
about some...
words I overheard?
You and the stranger,
Arbuthnot,
are closer than strangers
might be.
You said...
"Not now. When we are done.
Then no one can touch us."
What did you mean?
You think I meant murder?
To a man with a hammer,
every problem is a nail.
You live crime.
- You see evil every day.
- Not so.
I see enough crime to know
that the criminal act
is the anomaly.
I believe it takes
a fracture of the soul...
to murder another human being.
I ask again,
what did you mean?
As we established...
there are no laws
against my silence.
Very well.
<i>And afterwards,
Princess Dragomiroff?</i>
After dinner, I came to bed.
God blessed me with long life,
but cursed me with a bad back
to make it miserable.
About a quarter to 1:00...
I called for
Fr√§ulein Schmidt.
Mmm-hmm.
- She massaged me...
and read to me
for a while.
- Then I sleep.
- Mmm-hmm.
Were you ever acquainted...
with a family
by the name of Armstrong?
They endured
an unspeakable tragedy.
I was an admirer of
Sonia Armstrong's mother...
Linda Arden, the actress.
A once-a-century talent.
Miss Arden was to
turn to directing.
She would have
become the first
woman titan of Broadway...
were it not for the tragedy.
And this Linda Arden,
she is dead?
She might as well be.
She no longer
leaves her home.
Daisy was my goddaughter.
She was a...
I don't see how this relates
to our troubles, Detective.
The man killed last night,
his true name was Cassetti.
The man who murdered
little Daisy Armstrong.
I see.
I admit I know this family,
and now this man is dead.
The coincidence...
must seem unbearable.
You may be permitted
a coincidence.
I must now ask a few questions
of your <i>Fr√§ulein</i> Schmidt.
No. There is no need.
I can answer
to her character.
Even still, if you will allow.
Fraulein. Answer please in German.
But her Excellency cannot comprehend me.
That is the point.
This is yours? H for Hildegarde?
It is too fine for me.
This is the truth about last night?
As she said. She sent the conductor for me,
then I returned to bed.
Did you see anyone when you returned?
Only the other conductor.
"The other conductor."
You mean Michel?
No. A different
one than had awoken me.
Please come with me.
Are you sure
you did not see him?
I'm certain.
The other conductor
was a small man
with a short beard.
<i>Fr√§ulein,</i> there is
no other conductor.
I know what I saw.
I remember because
his voice was high
and the uniform
was the same exactly.
Though, I suspect,
missing one button.
Sir, I need your
passkey immediately.
We need to find a uniform
and a red kimono.
Thousands
of photographs,
endless pairs of socks...
dressing gowns
in every color but red...
and still no contraband
conductor's uniform.
Have we checked
all the passengers' luggage?
All except
for the Count
and Countess Andrenyi,
<i>monsieur.</i>
It is forbidden
to search their suitcases.
They travel
under diplomatic visas.
Where else could it be?
There is one last suitcase
we have not checked.
My own.
The killer
is mocking me.
Good. His first mistake.
And as the night
must follow the day...
<i>Pardon, mademoiselle.</i>
No, it's not mine.
I told you of the conductor.
Why would I tell you
- if it was me?
- You would not...
which makes your compartment
the ideal choice to hide it.
<i>Voil√†,</i> the button.
And if a conductor's
uniform...
why not a conductor's passkey?
Now we know how the killer
magically passed through
locked doors.
- Bourbon.
- MacQueen.
Now what are we
looking for now?
500 pounds.
MacQueen also had a ledger.
All his dealings
with Ratchett.
Where is it, hmm?
Poirot?
Bouc, keep everyone inside!
<i>Monsieur!
Please stop!</i>
<i>Monsieur!</i>
<i>Monsieur!</i>
Please stay
where you are.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.
So, it was MacQueen?
You have your man?
<i>Pardonnez-moi, madame.</i>
How could he?
<i>I didn't kill him!</i>
<i>You tried to burn
Ratchett's accounts...</i>
but they are still
legible in places.
The maths do not tally...
because you have been
stealing from him.
It is full of the...
What is the English word?
The <i>chocolat?</i>
- Fudge?
- Fudge!
It is full of the fudge!
You stole from him!
You thought
you would be found out.
That is why you killed him!
Yeah.
Yeah, you're damn right
I stole from him.
Thousands.
I knew his money
wasn't honest.
What did it matter if I
skimmed some off the top?
But let me ask you a question.
Why would I slaughter
my cash cow?
I didn't do it.
- I didn't kill him!
- He didn't.
He didn't.
I expect his alibi
revolves around me,
drinking till
the early hours.
Well, it's true.
I saw him having whiskey,
and remarked
on the lesser quality
of American liquor.
He offered me a tipple
to change my mind,
then another.
We got to arguing politics.
He had some...
tomfool opinions on Stalin
I had to correct. But the
man knows his spirits.
A word, please, <i>monsieur.</i>
You can confirm you were
with him all night?
We smoked and spoke
till nearly 2:00, yes.
Ah, such chums, him with
his cigarettes, and you...
Yes, you are the only man on
the train who smokes a pipe.
May I see your pipe
and your tobacco, please?
Of course.
And you, Dr. Arbuthnot,
were traveling from India,
I believe. Yes?
- You're interviewing me now?
- Mmm-hmm.
Were you ever in
Ratchett's compartment
- before he was killed?
- Certainly not.
But this is one of your
pipe cleaners, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>
If you found that in the dead
man's cabin, look elsewhere.
I am a doctor, sir.
I heal people.
I do not hurt them.
About this, see,
you must have worked
very hard to
become a doctor.
Not many of your race
are allowed the opportunity.
Middlesex Medical College
permits one per class.
I had the honor in '24.
I was a sniper in my tour.
A sharpshooter.
Saved more than
a few officers.
The more grateful,
recognized a fair mind
with a steady hand...
and supported my education.
I take their generosity
as a debt.
Did you know
a Colonel Armstrong?
Might have known
two or three Armstrongs.
Tommy in the 60th...
Selby Armstrong...
No, I meant
Colonel John Armstrong.
He had an American wife,
and his child was
kidnapped and killed.
Oh.
Never came across the fellow.
When did you first meet
Miss Debenham?
We met when we shared
the railway convoy car
from Kirkuk to Nissibin.
She claims otherwise,
and she has made herself
problematically suspicious.
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>
Mary is a lady.
Leave her out of this. I can
vouch for her character.
As you vouched
for MacQueen's time?
- You won't listen to reason.
- Never.
You are lucky.
The good doctor insists
he did not let you
out of his sight.
See? There.
Couldn't have done it.
Yes, you could.
Ratchett took a sleeping
draught each evening.
You could add barbital,
easily access that drug.
Do the same with one
of the doctor's many drinks...
and the chance
to kill him is clear.
Why would I do any of that?
We have established
your motive.
Perhaps I will
suggest a different one.
A different reason,
a more personal reason.
"A lawyer by education,
not by disposition."
Why did you pursue
the law, I wonder?
Was it to appease
a much loved,
but demanding father...
one who himself had made
a great success
in the same field...
and then lost his position?
There was a renowned
MacQueen, was there not?
The district attorney for
the state of New Jersey...
responsible
for the prosecution
of the Armstrong case.
They didn't have a suspect.
My dad was pressured
to go after
this poor French woman...
a maid with a weak alibi,
Susanne.
He hung his
whole case on her.
She killed herself.
She was innocent.
By the time the evidence
lead to Cassetti,
oh, he was long gone.
They tore my old man apart.
I couldn't do anything
for him.
And yet you claim
that you did not know
Ratchett was Cassetti?
No, no.
But you found him.
No.
You found him.
- You bled him dry...
- No.
in order to settle
your father's debts,
and then finally,
to settle the score.
No, no, no.
No. It wasn't...
It wasn't like that.
It's not the way...
Someone kicked in the door...
Doctor!
covered my face.
All right, this needs
to come out now.
- I want my bag.
- Of course.
It's in my compartment.
There will be no fingerprints.
The killer was disposing
of the murder weapon.
It's there!
The killer didn't hit
a lung or artery.
She's lucky to be alive.
You all are.
Yeah, some genius!
Why haven't you
solved this case?
You must give the man
some time.
Yeah, well...
I can't give that much more.
I don't have any blood left.
Yeah.
Accosting Mr. MacQueen,
and the real killer
is right here.
One of you people.
I don't know who you are.
I said nothing.
Please, leave me alone.
Play something.
My friends, the tracks will be
cleared by morning.
Please, return to your rooms.
I'm sleeping here...
where everyone can see me
and I can see everyone.
You should all do
the same. Conserve heat.
Remain in the open,
safely in view, until morning.
A killer will never
hesitate to kill again.
I will convey the same message
to the Andrenyis...
diplomatic immunity or not.
If I may,
I will look at your passports.
You know that
I must talk with her.
By the way, there is a grease
spot on your wife's name.
You might want
to look at that.
Elena is not well.
If you do not permit me,
your reluctance
will be noted
to the Yugoslav Police...
and I have no doubt that they
will arrest both you and...
How dare you!
Darling!
Darling.
You are funny-looking,
<i>monsieur</i> Poirot.
Are all detectives
so funny-looking?
I am sorry to wake you,
<i>Madame la Comtesse.</i>
Hmm.
I am always awake at night.
In the day, I sleep.
Some fear darkness,
but I cannot stand the light.
You are always
under the influence of...
Barbital.
Barbital, barbital.
I take oceans of it.
Oh, there's no use
in a lie, love.
He can see right through us.
I cannot go outside
without it.
I cannot sleep without it.
I take it against my fears.
What are you afraid of?
Everything.
Your passport has your
maiden name as Goldenberg.
Jewish, yes?
Not so Jewish.
My middle name isn't Maria.
And you are a dancer
like your husband?
No, not like my husband.
Corps de ballet.
He is touched by angels.
I have been
shoved by passion
and hard work to become adequate.
Excuse me,
I must lie down again.
Is this your only
dressing gown?
No, I have another.
Corn-colored chiffon.
I like speaking
to detectives.
You never know what they're
going to ask you next.
I'm particularly good
at capitals.
My governess was a stickler
for geography.
Are you satisfied?
I am always satisfied
when I uncover a liar.
<i>Madame,</i> your name is
not Elena. It is Helena.
Despite your clumsy attempts
to change it here
and on your luggage.
My husband heard
of a piece of evidence
found...
a handkerchief embroidered
with an "H,"
and didn't want
my "H" involved.
So we changed it.
The luggage and the passport.
It's no crime to want to
be distant from trouble.
Yet, here is trouble.
A curious detail
about the Armstrong tragedy
at the heart of this case...
is how many people
were wounded by it.
The younger sister.
The actress mother...
stage name, Linda Arden.
<i>I suppose she, too,
was of Jewish ancestry...</i>
as who is most likely
to take a stage name?
Is it too far to suggest...
her original name
was Goldenberg?
Especially when we find
a young woman,
the same age...
as her surviving daughter...
living in a world of fear?
The sister of
Sonia Armstrong.
Get out!
I hear noises and I run.
Just in time, yes?
You must now believe the count
and countess are the killers.
The count is protective.
The countess would no sooner
kill a bedroom spider.
And you may desist
with this charade.
You are neither an Austrian,
nor a German, nor a professor.
But a good imitation.
Was it based on
someone you know?
A local butcher where
I grew up was a Kraut.
Good man, great accent.
What was it?
You said "Tur-in..."
the emphasis
on the wrong syllable
for a proud and proper Teuton.
"Tu-reen."
You are one sharp knife,
I give you that.
<i>Herr</i> Professor
Gerhard Hardman...
is my cover.
I'm sorry about
the colored folks cracks.
Hell, I'm half a Heeb myself.
Cyrus Bethman Hardman.
You are a Pinkerton detective?
30 years.
I was in Stamboul,
coming back from a job,
when the office cabled.
Ratchett asked for a man
to tail him,
offering triple time.
Lucky me being nearby.
He told me to look out
for a small, dark man
with a high voice.
I watched that hall...
all night through
a crack in my door.
Any thug...
had to go by me first.
I'll take my oath on it.
And would you
also take your oath...
on your thirty years
as a Pinkerton Detective...
or would you
lie to me again...
and deny that you were,
in fact, a policeman first?
Your gun, the checkered grip,
the blue finish...
produced for
the Police Positive edition.
1927 issue.
It appears there are
no end to the lies
manufactured just for me.
You can leave your gun
as you go, Professor.
From the position
of his cabin...
it would have been
impossible to miss.
Unless Ratchett's
door was open...
as Pilar Estravados
claims she opened it.
In which case,
someone could have been...
masked from his view.
My darling Katherine.
This is an abominable crime...
and I am stuck, <i>ma</i> Katherine.
I cannot find
the crack in the wall.
Why does one of them elude me?
I have always been...
so sure.
Too sure.
But now, I am very humble.
And I say,
like a little child...
I do not know.
I am afraid, <i>ma</i> Katherine.
My apologies,
ladies and gentlemen.
It is not safe on board
whilst the engine
is put back on the tracks.
We are to wait in the tunnel.
Thank you.
Where
are they taking the dogs?
They'll be happy.
That's not right.
Just to stretch
their legs, it's good.
No, that's not right.
It's freezing!
Are we stuck?
You asked for me?
Another interrogation?
Oh, no. I enjoy your company.
<i>Merci,</i> Bouc.
Uh, please.
I have a list of ten questions
I am no nearer to answering...
and the train
is about to leave.
You have a clear mind...
and I thought that you might
produce an insight. Please.
Hmm.
"The handkerchief.
The pipe cleaner.
"The scarlet kimono.
The uniform.
"The time on the watch.
"Was he murdered then?
Earlier or later?
"By one person or more?
"Which of them?"
Sorry, I can't help you.
Uh... <i>Merci.</i>
Perhaps there is
an eleventh question
you don't know to ask yet...
that will give you
the answer to the rest.
Perhaps.
I could point an easy finger
at the, uh, Countess Andrenyi.
I discovered she was
Sonia Armstrong's sister.
- Are you certain?
- Yes.
I suspect she may
perhaps be innocent.
Perhaps.
But so many people
have lied to me
on this train
and do not seem to mind.
You yourself did
so effortlessly.
Me?
You told me you had
never been to America.
You also concealed the fact
that at the time
of the tragedy...
you were living
in the Armstrong household...
as governess
to their daughter.
And you know this.
I have my living to get.
A girl detained in connection
to a murder case...
no decent class family
would engage me.
Miss Debenham,
you planned Ratchett's murder.
And then you sent for
the countess to witness it.
If she saw him dead,
the Helena you knew
might return.
You waited for your roommate
to sleep, but she did not.
You drugged her.
But the barbital only
gave her a headache.
She begged for an aspirin
when the train stopped,
when the conductor was
on the station...
when the coast
was clear at last...
when you were allowed to enter
Ratchett's compartment,
unseen.
You loved Daisy Armstrong.
You killed Cassetti.
Cassetti was a pig.
He deserved to die.
She didn't kill him.
I did.
Mary, go.
I can't let you
take the blame...
for what I did alone.
Mary, please, go.
John Armstrong
was my best friend,
my commander.
He believed in me.
He sent me to medical school,
gave me a future.
Cassetti destroyed him.
In grief, I found Mary.
Then I found Ratchett.
Our plan was to reveal him
to the police,
that's what you heard.
But when I saw his face...
I knew he didn't
deserve a trial.
So, you drugged MacQueen.
You changed the time
on the watch...
so that you could lie
about the time of death.
I couldn't let Mary
be accused.
Or MacQueen.
My sins are mine
to pay for, alone.
I'm a soldier.
A soldier kills to protect.
And now, Mr. Poirot,
I must protect myself
from you.
Why aren't you dead yet?
Poirot?
Gentlemen, stop!
Sir, we need to get
all the passengers
back on the train.
You will retire...
away from the train...
until I tell you to return.
You tell your lies...
and you think
no one will know.
But there are two people
who will know.
Yes, two people.
Your God...
and Hercule Poirot.
It is time to solve this case.
Dr. Arbuthnot asked me
why I was not yet dead.
He knew, of course,
the answer.
A sharpshooter who does not
kill at close range?
Your shot was not a mistake.
It was a surgery.
You could not kill me
because you are no killer.
None of you are killers.
And yet, someone must be.
There are two possible
solutions to this crime.
One difficult,
because it fits with most
but not all of the facts...
and one more...
complex.
The first solution.
Ratchett had enemies.
A rogue Mafioso steals
onto the train at Vinkovci...
as MacQueen
and Arbuthnot take the air.
Equipped with a uniform
and a passkey,
he stabs Ratchett.
He leaves through
Mrs. Hubbard's compartment,
and makes his escape.
No.
No, no, no. It doesn't work.
Why hide the uniform, hmm?
Who drugs Ratchett?
Or stabs Mrs. Hubbard?
Damn it, man!
So I ask,
who stands to benefit?
This crime is the murdering
of a murderer.
The benefit is, perhaps...
to the spirit,
an ease of suffering.
To quiet a shouting voice
in the head
that prevents sleep.
There is a murderer among us.
So...
We have Dr. Arbuthnot,
a dedicated, grateful friend
to Colonel Armstrong.
He meets and finds solace
in the company of the
governess, Mary Debenham...
who is almost like a mother
to the little girl.
And so close to
Mrs. Armstrong's young sister,
Helena Goldenberg...
married to a powerful man
no stranger
to rage and violence.
We travel also
with Daisy's godmother...
to whom belongs...
the monogrammed handkerchief
found at the scene
of the crime.
The letter "H"
in the Russian alphabet,
of course, pronounced "N."
Natalia Dragomiroff.
And her devoted maid
with a chef's eye?
Who was she before
her current employ?
Might I suggest
the Armstrongs' cook?
But we are not yet done.
The nurse
in charge of Daisy...
her newfound religious zeal
born of guilt
at allowing her charge...
to be abducted.
It was you, was it not...
<i>in her room the night when</i>
<i>Ratchett came in
through the window?</i>
Did you have
a glass of wine too many
with your supper that night?
Have you blamed yourself
ever since...
for not being alert
to stop him?
She knew nothing
but kindness...
and love, until...
until I...
No need
to divine with me, sir.
I was Colonel Armstrong's
batman in the war.
And afterwards,
his valet in New York.
As fine a man
as God ever made.
Would his chauffeur agree?
Was it a bank loan,
secured by Armstrong,
allows him to build
his automobile empire?
He's indebted for life.
Who else can we count?
What of
the Pinkerton detective,
once a police officer...
assigned to
the Armstrong case?
And he becomes attached
to someone,
for there is another,
uncelebrated victim.
You fell in love with the maid
before she was
falsely accused.
<i>You quit the police
when you witnessed...</i>
<i>the travesty of justice...</i>
<i>when MacQueen's father
insisted on her arrest.</i>
When she took her own life.
No! No, no!
Susanne was so gentle.
And she fell for me.
Old and already getting grey.
I told her
she could do better...
but there she was...
on time for every date.
Why else is a train...
so full in the dead of winter?
Why the inconsistent wounds?
Why the abundance
of evidence? Why...?
Why the conductor?
Pierre Michel of Avignon...
who lost his sister...
the accused maid...
Susanne Michel.
Only one soul can
claim to have lost
more than any of you.
The tragic Linda Arden...
mother of Sonia...
grandmother of Daisy.
Retired from the stage...
but for one final performance.
You're an awfully clever man.
A murder should
have one victim.
When Ratchett kills
Daisy Armstrong...
a dozen lives are broken,
deformed, ended.
They demand justice!
Of all these wounded souls,
we must finally answer...
who among them is a killer?
Who takes up the knife?
The answer is...
No single one of you
could have done it.
Nor any pair.
It can only have been done...
by all of you.
<i>Together.</i>
<i>Together.</i>
<i>Even when the avalanche
changes everything...</i>
<i>as does the detective,
plans must change.</i>
<i>The kimono, the uniform.</i>
<i>A remarkable improvisation,</i>
<i>the doctor who knows how to
wound without killing.</i>
<i>Each has their part to play.</i>
Do it.
<i>It was my plan.</i>
I recruited them.
I had Hardman
track down Cassetti.
I sent MacQueen
to work for him,
and then Masterman.
MacQueen could arrange
he travel on the day
that Michel was on duty.
Mr. Ratchett?
It's nothing.
<i>Bien, monsieur.</i>
Good night.
<i>And so it is done.</i>
<i>For the death of the innocent.</i>
<i>A life for a life.</i>
Revenge.
No one should
hang for this but me.
It was my plan!
Tell the police
it was me, alone.
There's no life
left in me anymore.
They have a chance now.
Helena, I pray...
has a chance.
They can...
go live...
find some joy...
somewhere.
Let it end with me.
They're not killers.
They're good people.
They can be good again.
There was right,
there was wrong.
Now there is you.
I cannot judge this.
You must decide.
You wish to go free
without punishment
for your crime...
then you must only
commit one more.
I will not stop you.
You can't let them kill you.
You give my body
to the lake,
and you walk away innocent
at the station.
You must silence me.
Bouc can lie.
I cannot.
Do it! One of you!
Don't.
I already died with Daisy.
No!
You said your role
was to find justice.
What is justice here?
Sometimes, the law of man
is not enough.
Where does conscience lie?
Buried with Daisy.
<i>My dear
Colonel Armstrong.</i>
<i>Finally, I can answer
your letter...</i>
<i>at least with the thoughts
in my head</i>
<i>and the feeling in my heart...</i>
<i>that somewhere,
you can hear me.</i>
<i>I have now discovered</i>
<i>the truth of the case,
and it is...</i>
<i>profoundly disturbing.</i>
<i>I have seen the fracture
of the human soul.</i>
<i>So many broken lives,
so much pain and anger...</i>
<i>giving way to the poison
of deep grief...</i>
<i>until one crime became many.</i>
<i>I have always wanted
to believe</i>
<i>that man is rational
and civilized.</i>
<i>My very existence depends
upon this hope...</i>
<i>upon order and method
and the little gray cells.</i>
<i>But now, perhaps,
I am asked...</i>
<i>to listen, instead...</i>
<i>to my heart.</i>
Ladies and gentlemen...
I have understood in this case
that the scales of justice...
cannot always be
evenly weighed.
And I must learn, for once...
to live with the imbalance.
There are no killers here.
Only people who deserve
a chance to heal.
The police have accepted
my first solution
to the crime...
the lone assassin
who made his escape.
I will leave the train here
to conclude formalities.
You are all free to go.
And may you find
your peace with this.
May we all.
Hello.
I'm looking for
a Mr. Poirot.
He's needed
on a very urgent matter.
Ah. He is on holiday.
The, uh, Kassner case again?
No, sir, far worse.
I have to take him
to Egypt straight away.
There's been a murder, sir,
right on the bloody Nile.
Are you the detective?
Yes.
I am the detective.
Could you please
straighten your tie?
I will see you at the car.
Here you are, sir.
<i>Merci.</i>
<i>Allons-y.</i>
