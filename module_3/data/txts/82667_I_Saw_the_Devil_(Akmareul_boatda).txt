These are all old pictures.

It's a fucking psycho.
Fucking asshole.
Hello, sir.
Don't know where you're headed,
but you can hop in.
You don't want a ride?
There won't be other cars.

You're so lucky.
It's not easy to get a cab aroun here
This guy is headed same direction so...

- Yes, of course
Wasn't is difficult finding a cub there?
You must have not seen any cars there
Here is strange area for me too

But today l have two customers!
I think I am lucky today
Is it not?
Way out here
in the dark of the night.
What's so funny?
What made you laugh?
- Hey...
- Yes?
You said we're all lucky today.
Yes, I did. Why?
But I guess...
You are very unlucky
Crazy bastards.
You're young. lt'll heal fast.
No worries
And soccer...
You shouldn't play so roughly.
Do you use your wrists when playing soccer?
Anyway, from now on

We're done. You can leave
Hey, you motherfucker.
Am I your fucking son?
So watch the way you talk to me.
Take off your glasses.
Come here.
Come over here.
Come this way sir

How old are you?
l'm 22.
Oh, nice...22..
Boyfriend?
Eh?
Bet you have tons of boyfriends.
Right?
No. l don't have any.
Don't fucking lie to me.
No boyfriends to a pretty girl like you?
You don't know that well
lf you don't know,
then you don't know.
Actually, I was gonna have fun last night
But things got bad
because of a fucking bastard
So this time...
...let's make this easy.
Take off your clothes
Eh?
Take them off
We are gonna do it anyway
Then you need to enjoy it too
so strip off
Strip before l cut up
your fucking face, bitch!
Now, bitch!
Good girl
Take off your bra too. Hurry up.
Please...
Good.
Take off your skirt too
You son of a bitch.
Who the fuck are you?
Wait a second
Stay here.
He'll need your first aid
Don't be weak.
This is just the beginning.
Remember this...
This is gonna get worse and worse
Look away, Miss.
Look away and plug your ears too
Fuck you, crazy motherfucker!
Son of a bitch!
So you wanna do this game huh?
You really want to do this,
motherfucker?
Crazy motherfucker.
Fine! Let's see who is getting
this fucking shit
What is it?
Has there been an accident?
Something's wrong with his car.
Yes, sir.
ls everything OK?
l'm just worried about you,
that's all.
The police think
l'm chasing after Jang.
Seems like they're after him, too.
So you know...
I think you better stop it now...
- But l...
- That's enough
l want you to stop.
But, sir...
Never mind
l'll talk to you later.
lt's me.
- Soo-hyun.
- Yeah, how are you doing?
What about you?
Well, just busy
working on something.
Really? What kind of work?
You know what my job is
l know what you do normally,
but I am asking what you do under the radar
Dad gave you the files,
right?
Soo-hyun...
I know how painful you are
But I want you to stop the thing
That doesnt't make her revive
How harsh you punish him,
nothing gets changed
Revenge is a story for movies
He is just a psycho
Sorry. l got nothing
to say to you.
Why not?
Am I not your family?
Do you know my life these days?
Recently, l always look back to check
if someone is chasing me or not
But you say that you got nothing to say?
How dare you say like that...
So please... Soo-hyun...
That's meaningless
Please stop...
Sorry, l need to hang up now
And this work is not meaningless like that
Soo-hyun? Soo-hyun?
Water. Give me some water.
Remember the first time we met?
We tried to organize a terrorist group
to fuck the world up!
l really miss those days.
We were afraid of notthing.
Stop talking the bullshit and
give me a cigarette
It's one of the family members of
your the victims
No other possibilities
He's like us
He's enjoying the moment of
the excitement when hunting
Catching and releasing the prey.
Catching and releasing.
He's playing the hunting game
Man...
Looks like you are fucked up little bit
He got crazy after he lost his bitch
Advent of a monster.
Interesting
Get some sleep. I bet you're tired
I got plenty of empty rooms
Take any room you want
And l'll go to prepare tomorrow's breakfast
Fucking bastards.
Let go of me!
Fuck you son of bitch
- Don't move
- Shit, you guys are fucking crazy.
Harder! Harder
Harder.
He's enjoying the moment of
the excitement when hunting
Catching and releasing the prey.
Catching and releasing.
He's enjoying the excitement
seeing prey's pain
He's playing a hunting game
It's gonna get worse and worse
Interesting
Shit...
Don't behave like that
Didn't you see your sister last night?
lf you fight it,
it'll only be more painful and take longer
lt'll all be over soon
So just bear with me.
Then why did you suspect us?
Did we ask you for a house
or for money?
We only wanted to stay for days
but you gave us shit!
l'm sorry. l'm really sorry.
You should've apolized at that time
Damn bitches.
Always acting up when it's too late!
Hold on. The order is wrists, legs and head
   Right?
Close your eyes. You don't wanna see this
Where is she?
How did you get in
without making a noise?
l'm pregnant.
l was curious about you man
what you'd look like.
You don't look like a monster.
Crazy bastard.
Wrists, legs and head, right?
Exactly as you'd do it.
Nothing more.
No worries
You crazy, psycho fuckers.
l'm actually relieved now.
l was worried you might not get better
and live your life
He's Soo-hyun Kim
from National lntelligence, right?
Do you want to see
what he's been doing?
Please make him stop.
You can't become a monster
to fight against a monster.
You know it's wrong.
Where is he now?
Your wounds are treated.
You'll get better soon
You and he slept
for two days straight.
What happened?
Sir?
Just hand the beast over.
It didn't even get started
What are you going to do?
You know...
It's like a huge rock is pressing my heart
It feels like that...
l promised Ju-hyun to pay him back the pain
Not enough yet
This is the begining
All right. No more questions.
So, the capsule's working well?
Unless he has diarrhoea...
Don't worry.
The bastard's completely out.
He'll be out
for another day at least.
You know, you changed a lot, sir?
Hello.
Pain killers please.
With dexibuprofen.
What? Dexi what?
- Just give me the strongest kind.
- Very well.
Where are you now?
Guess you're not around.
Hey, are you listening?
Of course you are.
lt's fucking interesting!
Never had such fun in my life.
Let me guess who you are
Ju-hyun Jang
who used to live in Yeonheedong. Right?
Am I wrong?
But you made a mistake.
You underestimated me.
You'll regret not killing me
when you had the chance.
l'll get you soon.
Hello.
You'll see.
l'll teach you what real pain is.
What are you doing? Hey, you!
By the way...
She said this before she gets killed
that she was pregnant
She begged for her life.
Did you know that?
Hurry up, asshole.
Otherwise, the man will die.
Should keep close to me if you let me alive
Kyung-chul Jang,
where did you go?
Do we have to go through all this shit
to save bastards like them?
Seeing scum like them
makes me sorry to be human.
Call me when they wake up.
What is it this time?
What is it?
What?
Are you sure?
OK.
Hey...Kyung-chul Jang
is turning himself in.
You made a mistake,
you son of a bitch.
Wake up.
l have a question.
Where would your friend go?
You've chose the wrong guy.
He always pay back
Do you know what that means?
Your girl, your girl's family.
Then he's turning himself in
and you get crazy
But...
I bet she wasn't feeling that bad
Unlike me,
he likes to give pleasure
before he gives pain!
He gives pleasure first!
Funny?
ls that funny?
That really amuses you?
All right, l'll make you smile
for the rest of your life!
l traced a call from Jang.
l was tapping the police
investigating Jang.
Jang just called them and said
he'd turn himself in today.
But before that, he said
he got something to do for the last time
ls he going to kill again?
- What's his location?
- Yeonheedong
Parcel delivery!
Captain Oh?
This is Soo-hyun Kim.
What?
What the hell have you done?
lf something happens to him,
l'll kill you! You got that?
Fucking answer me!
Send the nearest men
to the Chief's house now!
Turn around!
Not much resemblance.
No.
Ju-yeon must've taken
after her mother.
Good thing
she didn't look like you.
Why'd you come at me like that,
you old bastard?
Are you crazy?
Let me see.
Shit, where is it?
What would make
that motherfucker get angry?
Would he get mad if l do this?
Like this?
Like this? Like this huh?
Like this, crazy motherfucker?
Like this, you son of a bitch?
Dad?
l'm home.
- You can't come inside.
- Stay back.
What is it?
Let go of him.
Are you Soo-hyun Kim?
You bastard! Come here!
Have you any idea what you've done?
How dare you show up here!
You piece of shit!
Let go. Let go of me!
You son of a bitch.
Out of the way.
Out of the way!
Hello?
This is Kyung-chul Jang.
Bastard!
Where the hell are you?
You haven't done anything
to Se-hyun?
You'll know that
Take this
Hello.
So how does it feel?
You shouldn't have fucked with me,
you mother fucker
Who do you think got the game?
You or me?
lt's Kyung-chul Jang!
- lt's Jang, kyung-chul
- Wait for my command.
Now!
Hurry up!
Get him! Get him!
Get him!
You were right.
l made a mistake.
l underestimated you.
l'll treat you right from now on.
What are you doing,
you son of a bitch?
It's just the beginning.
Don't be like a kid
You son of a bitch!
Just kill me, you son of bitch.
Just kill me!
You fuck! Kill me, you bastard!
Hurry up and kill me.
You bastard!
Not just yet. Be patient
Think. You would've been killed already
If I wanted to
l'll kill you at your most painful moment.
When you're trembling
because of the pain
l'll kill you then.
That's the real revenge.
True revenge.
Spare...
Spare my life.
Let me live....please.
Let me live.
You heard that a lot, right?
"Let me live."
Were you happy hearing it?
Let me live.
Please.
l'll pay for my sins.
So please let me go.
You've done enough.
Please...you've done enough
Please stop
Please, please spare my life.
l'm sorry.
l'm begging you.
l beg you, spare my life.
Are you afraid?
Tell me. Are you afraid?
Now.. you realize what you've done?
If you have done this much
fucking around with me
Stop now You fucking son of bitch
Stop talking bullshit
You've already lost.
You think you won huh?
Fuck you.
Pain? l don't know the shit
Fear? l don't know that, either.
There's nothing
you can again from me
So...you've lost already.
Got that?
l hope that...
...you sufferfrom the pain
even after you die.
Son of a bitch!
You hear me?
lt's not over!
l'll live no matter what!
I'll live, you son of a bitch!
Can you hear me?
Eh? Are you listening to me?
l'm afraid of nothing!
Son of bitch.. You think I am easy?
Dad?
Dad!
Hey!
Hey, don't open the door!
Dad?
No, no, don't open the door!
No! Don't open the door,
Sang-won!
What the hell is he saying?
Don't open it.
lt's stuck.
No, no!
What the fuck are you doing here?
- Mom!
- Are you in there?
No. Don't open the door!
Don't open the door!
Fuck! Go back!
Kyung-chul!
