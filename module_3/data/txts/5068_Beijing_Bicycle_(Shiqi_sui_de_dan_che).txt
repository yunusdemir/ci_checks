How old are you?
-19.
Where are you from?
-Shanxi. In Xiyang.
Where?
-Xiyang.
Hebei. I'm from Hebei.
What did you do back home?
I was working as a farmer.
In an office.
Host.
-What?
What kind of host?
-Radio host.
When did you arrive?
-A month ago.
I came last September.
Are you working in Beijing now?
What kind of job?
-Construction.
Construction, farm labor, small jobs.
In medical equipment.
Can you ride a bike?
-Yes.
Your name?
-Guo Lian-Guei.
Express delivery?
-Yes.
I don't know.
-I'm not sure.
How much did you make a month?
-A few hundred. Almost 1000 yuan.
How much exactly?
-600, 700, 800...
From now on, you are employees
of Fei Da Express Delivery.
We've cleaned you up
and cut your hair...
...because we want
to change your image.
We want to help you country kids...
...to fit in society
and to represent our company.
Your image is our image.
You have to treasure
this wonderful opportunity.
These bikes that we gave you
are your livelihood.
These are upscale mountain bikes.
You may not have seen any
where you come from.
We are providing you
with such good bikes...
...for our company's image,
but also to make you more efficient...
...so we can be competitive.
But let me make one thing clear:.
these bikes are not gifts.
To start, you'll get 20%
of each delivery charge.
We'll keep the remaining 80%%.
Once you've earned enough,
the bike will be yours.
Thereafter, we'll go 50-50.
It's a new management policy.
Understood?
Behind you is a map of Beijing.
You'll have to know every street...
...every avenue and alley,
like the back of your hand.
Think of yourselves
as the carrier pigeons of today.
Work hard.
Little Guei.
Tell me... What's this?
They hired you?
Well done. Let me have a look.
Listen to that.
What's it made of?
Stainless steel.
Looks like you found
a dream job, Guei.
You'll have to work hard.
It has gears.
I bet you never get tired
riding this.
Hungry?
Come in.
Take the bike.
Have some meat.
It'll build your strength.
Take a look.
You see that?
City folk...
They're not even happy
with a big house.
She never smiles.
If it was me,
I'd eat dessert every day.
And spareribs at every meal.
Look, she changed dresses.
Isn't she pretty?
Very pretty.
There's no harm
in looking, is there?
Do you know her?
She comes to buy
soy sauce all the time.
Did you see that? Those city girls...
They've got tons of clothes.
So wasteful.
Stop staring. It's bad for your health.
Go to work.
Little Guei,
when will the bicycle be yours?
Three more days at the most.
You son of a bitch.
You've only been working a month.
You're gonna be rich.
Listen...
Here she comes.
Mrs Liu, is it all paid up now?
I told you already.
You still owe 70 yuan.
But I counted. It should be enough.
-Your counting doesn't add up.
I'll see the manager.
You're so stubborn.
Don't bother trying to see him.
He's very busy.
It's only 70 yuan.
You can make that in one day.
It's not even the price
of a bottle of aspirin.
Come and see me tomorrow.
Then the bike will be yours.
I'm telling you,
city people are mean.
They play with you
when they pay you.
It's no big deal.
They can't cheat you much longer.
It's only one more day.
And it's a great job.
You earn a bike in only one month.
The trick is not to let anyone know
you're not from here. Understand?
Look at you.
Brush your teeth.
Come on.
And your job lets you
see nice places, too.
High class places.
I've heard that there's music playing
in hotel toilets.
I wouldn't be able to pee...
Good afternoon, sir.
Welcome.
Are you looking for someone?
-Mr Zhang.
He's waiting for you inside.
-Thanks.
Wait. Your badge.
A customer.
Slippers, sir.
Please follow me.
This way, please.
Are you looking for someone, sir?
-Mr Zhang.
This way, please.
Mr Zhang, you have a visitor.
Is that you, Gua?
What took you so long?
Let me finish this first.
Where's Gua?
And who are you?
Express Delivery.
Express Delivery? What's that?
I'm supposed to see a Mr Zhang.
I'm Zhang.
What do you want?
Do you need something delivered?
-No.
Does anyone need
something delivered?
Leave.
You've got the wrong person.
Get lost.
There are tons of Zhangs around.
Try Zhang Yimou.
Express Delivery or not,
you shower, you pay.
But I didn't come for a shower. I came
to see Mr Zhang. He sent for me.
Mr Zhang says it's not true.
I'm from the delivery company.
You can check this.
There's no point.
-Please, take a look.
You had a shower,
so now you have to pay.
But you told me to go in.
-That's true.
But since you showered,
you have to pay.
But you sent me in to shower.
I didn't want to.
I went in and
you took my clothes.
You showered
and now we have to make you pay.
There's nothing I can do.
Let me go.
I have no money.
What's going on? Let him go first.
Mr Zhang, he had a shower
and now he won't pay.
He says he's a courier,
looking for Mr Zhang.
I called for him. So you're the one.
Thanks, gentlemen.
You certainly took your time.
So you went for a shower?
You're a wise guy.
Give me the envelope.
-Which one?
The one I gave you.
You're lucky I didn't leave.
Okay. So take this to 123 Wang Fu
Jing Avenue, to Mr Li. Got that?
Now run.
He didn't pay.
-As if he could afford it.
I can't believe you.
You have to deliver it, bike or no.
It's more important than the bike.
Stop crying already.
You're lucky the manager
didn't fine you.
This'll be a lesson for you
for your next job.
Don't be so stubborn.
I'm saying it for your own good.
Okay, get going.
You're right, of course.
I'm sorry, very sorry.
Yes, yes, all right...
We fired him.
Don't worry, it won't happen again.
You can count on us.
You're still here?
Sir, give me another bike.
Don't you get it?
I didn't fire you because of the bike.
It's just bad luck that it got stolen.
It was almost yours anyway.
That's all settled.
But you got me into serious trouble.
Did you hear me on the phone?
Because of you, I have to grovel.
Lenient customers
will only ask for compensation.
Others will want to sue me.
And I can't replace
every single stolen bicycle.
Sir, I want to keep this job.
Don't you understand?
Are you really that stubborn?
You don't even have a bike anymore.
What if I find it?
-What?
I'm sure I can find my bicycle.
Are you crazy or what?
Do you know how many of those
there are in Beijing?
I made a mark on it.
You're not so stupid after all.
No wonder they say you're stubborn.
If you really did mark it
and you can find that bike...
...your determination
will get you another chance.
If you find the bike,
I'll take you back. Okay?
Do I have your word?
-Absolutely.
So your dad
finally bought you a bike, Jian?
Not bad.
You didn't steal it, did you?
Stop your bullshit.
-What a temper.
Don't go.
My chain derailed.
It is a nice bike.
I have to go.
I know this is going to upset you.
I know I promised...
...but it's not possible right now.
There's nothing I can do.
Your little sister worked hard
and she passed her exams.
She'll be able to go
to a good school.
We have to pay her tuition.
I discussed it with your mother,
but I made the decision myself.
Your sister's schooling
is more important.
Of course, getting you a bike
is important too.
But unlike others, we can't afford it.
I have to choose.
You're old enough to understand.
I feel bad seeing you
so upset.
As soon as I get paid next month
I'll buy you a bike.
I'll do it, okay?
Come on, let's go.
I'm tired.
Let's go home.
Guei, you're so stubborn.
You're not going to steal a bike,
are you?
Come on.
What are you waiting for?
I'm leaving.
What are you doing?
Good-bye.
Come on.
What got into you, stealing a bike?
So much fuss for a lousy bike.
I don't care if you're guilty or not.
But don't ever do this to me again.
Go back where you came from.
You've caused me enough trouble.
All that fuss for a lousy bike.
For the last time,
don't get me involved anymore.
You're no longer with the company.
Don't bother me again.
No. I'm really busy today.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Is that okay with you?
Call me tonight. Bye.
Let's go.
-You're not paying?
Come here.
What are you doing?
How dare you try again.
He stole my bike.
-It's not true.
You didn't do it? I saw him,
and chased him the whole way.
So you're a bicycle thief?
Where are you from?
-Let's take him to the police.
Did you steal it?
-It's my bike.
Where does it say it's yours?
-Let's not waste time. Take the bike.
Take him to the police.
Wanna see who's strongest?
Take your bike.
You wanna fight?
Go ahead, take your bike.
You got the guts to steal
one of our bikes? Some nerve.
You got it?
You're here.
Do you wanna play?
This is great.
Let's go.
Shit.
Game's over.
No more tokens.
You lost again?
I don't have any either.
Go and buy some.
-I'm always the one who pays.
Just one more time.
I'll get some tokens. Wait here.
Did you see Xiao?
Your mother and l
have searched the whole house.
I just don't understand
why we can't find it.
The whole thing is driving me nuts.
Two days ago, I was worried
it wasn't hidden well enough.
Now look. Even I can't find it.
I don't get it.
Even if the house had been robbed...
...the thief wouldn't have known
where to look.
And we haven't had any guests recently.
Jian.
I don't want to ask you this...
...but I have to know.
Tell me...
...did you take it?
No.
Our two families together
must be like one family.
You're not a child anymore. You're
old enough to know right from wrong.
This business about missing money,
let's forget about it. It's over.
If you say you didn't do it,
I believe you.
Because you're my son.
That bike I promised you.
Next payday...
I'll buy it for you.
I'll keep my word this time.
-I don't want it.
You're still mad at me?
Okay. Let's forget about it.
You can go to your room.
I'll be damned. Unbelievable.
He found it.
Wake up.
Good for you.
You country folk.
A real 'Little Engine That Could.'
Is he all right?
I'm feeling charitable.
I'll take you back.
Come on in.
But be careful from now on.
Wanna go for a bike ride?
We're going now.
-Leave me alone.
Come on.
You go. Stop bugging me.
-Whatever you say.
You know where to find us.
Don't be so upset.
It's just a bike.
You can always buy another one.
Forget about it.
It's no big deal.
-No big deal?
I'm sorry.
Are you coming?
-Don't wait for me.
You have no bike, I can take you.
-I don't need your help.
How about you taking me?
Can't I just go home alone?
Just go.
Leave me alone.
Stop dreaming.
She's out of our league.
Who's that?
-Da Huan.
You got it.
So, was it a stolen bike?
-No way. Bicycle thief yourself.
Hey, it was just a lousy bike.
-Shut up, you.
Don't get all worked up.
-What if I do.
Cut it out.
-I do what I want.
You say we're brothers
and then you call me a thief?
So you did steal that bike...
-What did you say?
Come on, say it again.
I was joking.
-You think that's funny?
Why are you getting all worked up?
It was only a joke.
Stop fighting and talk it over.
-We're brothers.
He's no brother of mine.
-lt was just a joke.
Keep your jokes to yourself.
So if you didn't steal the bike,
let's go get it back.
Anybody know where the guy works?
I heard he's a bicycle courier
somewhere.
With 'Fei Da.'
Hold it.
Bicycle thief.
Jian, is your bike okay?
-It's fine.
Hurry up.
-Wait up.
It's okay, Jian...
Just don't think about it, okay?
We've gotta go.
Where is it?
Little shit. You're a thief.
-I am not.
Then where did you get this bike?
-You didn't keep your word.
You've been promising me a bike
for years. You always find excuses.
I should have got one in high school.
When I got there, where was the bike?
Then I had to rank
in the top five of the class.
I'm in the top five of the school, now.
And now, it's because of her.
Because she got into a good school.
You're all against me.
I'm not a kid anymore.
I won't believe you again.
You can't fool me anymore.
Even if we were wrong,
you can't go stealing bikes.
I didn't steal it.
Then where did this bike come from?
-I bought it.
That's a lie. He stole it.
It's mine.
I bought it, I didn't steal yours.
You bought it? With what?
With what money? As if you had any.
What money? Answer me.
With the money for my bike.
What do you mean,
'money for your bike'?
That money was for me.
None of your business
what I did with it.
What gives you the right to hit me?
You bastard.
You stole from your own family.
It was you.
Did you ever buy me a bike?
Adults should keep their promises.
How many times did you promise?
-That's enough.
Everything is clear now.
It was our fault.
I'm sorry.
Go on, take your bicycle.
Why are you letting him take it?
Stop him.
Don't you dare.
Give me back my bike.
I bought it myself.
I didn't steal it.
My mother and your father say
it's their fault.
They're nicer to me than to you.
I think that bike is yours, too.
And that you bought it second-hand.
You bought it, you didn't steal it.
It's so unfair.
We can't just let it drop.
You gave it to him
because he said it's his.
If I told you it's mine,
would you give it to me?
Anyway, you paid for it, didn't you?
He says his bicycle was stolen.
So he should look for the thief
and leave us alone.
This really sucks.
No one's ever done this to me.
I feel humiliated too.
Just one word from you, Jian...
...and we go after him.
We'll get your bike back.
One word from you and we'll do it.
Just say the word.
You trying to play dumb?
Whose bike is this?
-Mine.
You still say it's yours?
Still yours?
-Don't waste your breath on him.
It's mine. I marked it.
-A mark? Where?
Right here.
Those scratches there?
Hey, wait.
Here's another bike.
There's a scratch on it.
Is it yours, then?
So take this one.
So if you go out everyday
and leave your mark on some bikes...
...you'll never need to work.
Just mark one everyday and sell it.
This bike was mine.
-He's starting again.
You stupid or something?
-So you still say it's yours?
You're really stubborn.
Think it over.
I'm asking one last time.
Whose bike is this?
This bike is mine.
Whose?
-Mine.
Whose?
Mine.
-Still yours?
Wait, wait.
I'm gonna make you understand.
Whose bike it is, I don't give a...
Don't waste your time on him.
Whose bike this was originally,
I don't care.
I only know that two days ago...
...he paid 500 yuan for it
at the used bike market.
Then he had the seat
and the handlebars replaced.
I paid for the handlebars. It cost me
80 yuan. I had a 100-yuan bill.
And here's the change.
20 yuan left.
You see them?
I don't care whose bike this was.
But he paid 500 yuan for it.
So it's his now. You can look elsewhere
for the guy who stole it.
But this bike is mine.
Let me talk to him.
Regardless of what happened.
Regardless of who used to own it.
I'm telling you
I paid 500 yuan for it.
You say it was stolen
but that's none of my business.
I bought it. So go look for
your thief somewhere else.
I'm taking my bike.
-Who says you didn't steal it?
Let's settle this. We're all tired.
We're hungry.
What do you say?
I've got an idea.
Look.
If you really like the bike,
you can have it. No problem.
But Jian paid for it.
If he doesn't get the bike,
how about the money?
He should get his money back,
shouldn't he?
How much did you pay for it?
-500.
So you give him 500 yuan, okay?
500 and it's yours.
We won't charge you for the seat.
It's a good deal.
I don't have any money.
And I already paid for it.
You paid for it?
And what about me?
Don't forget that I paid for the seat.
I put money into it too.
What about 400 yuan?
Just four 1 00-yuan bills.
What a pig-headed bastard.
-300 yuan?
Not a peep out of him.
Too expensive for you?
What should we do now?
Give us an idea.
You're good with ideas.
We've been here all day.
We're tired.
We can't take any more of this.
Okay, I have another idea.
-A good one? Let's hear it.
This bike, you and Jian swap,
every other day.
You find something better.
You got a better solution?
What else can we do?
He won't pay.
It's the only way.
We got here during the day.
And now it's night.
It's dark now.
And you know what? I'm hungry.
We're wasting our time and energy
on this bicycle thing, aren't we?
What's with you?
-Say something.
Here, have a smoke.
You gave him a smoke?
-You joking or what?
We're negotiating.
Negotiating?
-You gotta be kidding.
So, what do you say?
And you, Jian?
Let's get this over with.
Every other day? You call that a deal?
You agreed to that?
How will you work without the bike?
Look, Mom. It's like I told you.
-Qin, what are you doing here?
This bike isn't so bad.
Just a little beat-up.
You've gotta pedal hard.
But it's better than nothing.
What are you looking at?
What's your name?
-Guo Lian-Guei.
I'm Jian.
I would never have guessed.
She was a maid.
Who are you talking about?
The one you ran into.
The one who used to buy my soy sauce.
What happened to her?
She wore her boss's high heels.
And her clothes.
She even sold some of them.
The boss found out.
What happened to her?
Fired.
Disappeared.
If I'd known
she was from the country...
Got a light?
Not a bad bike.
You bastard.
Keep the bike.
Don't bother bringing it back.
I don't need it anymore.
There he is. Quick.
Why are you following me?
You wanna get a beating or what?
Get out of here.
Are you stupid or what?
-I don't know the way out.
Why are they following me?
-It's me they're after.
Get out of here.
Don't let him go.
Why me? I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
But it's six against one.
I didn't do anything.
Let's go.
Leave him. Let's go.
I didn't do anything.
Give me back my bicycle.
Give me back my bicycle.
Give me back my bicycle.
I didn't do anything.
Give me back my bicycle.
Stop breaking it, please.
Don't break my bike.
