<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Get the truck in!</i>
<i>[Chattering]</i>
<i>[Man] Damn it!</i>
<i>I said pull your men back.</i>
I don't want any more casualties.
Get that news crew
behind the line!
- Sir!
- I got men down. I got rumors flying.
What the hell's
going on down here?
We tried the urban assault tank.
SWAT tried the roof.
The guys in there are pros,
and, sir?
- They say they've got a nuke.
- Jesus!
And I'm up for reelection.
What are we gonna do?
Don't worry. We've called in
some pros of our own.
Who the hell are <i>those</i> people?
- Sheriff's department.
- <i>The Reno Sheriff's Department-</i>
the finest team of
law enforcement officers ever assembled.
But where the hell's
your commanding officer?
<i>[Motorcycle Approaching]</i>
[Groans]
Ow. Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
All right, talk to me, people.
What do we got?
Thirty-five civilians on the 40th floor.
Twenty-two Chechnyan separatists,
heavily armed.
They say they got a nuke,
and I don't think they're just whistling "Dixie."
<i>All right, people,</i>
<i>here's how this is gonna go down.</i>
Jones, Garcia,
head into the sewer system...
breach the perimeter of that building
and get that nuke...
- before they flambé half of Washoe County.
- You got it, sir.
Kimball, Johnson,
take up sniper positions, so and so.
- Got it.
- Junior, I want you to shave Miss Acapulco...
- <i>and shave her good.</i>
- All over it, sir!
<i>[Foam Hissing]</i>
<i>Wait, hold on, man. How come Junior</i>
<i>gets to shave Miss Acapulco...</i>
and I got to go down
in the sewers?
Why does he have to shave anybody?
<i>[Tone]</i>
[Snorts]
Oh, wow.
I just had the weirdest dream.
- You know you're driving, right?
- [Screams]
Huh.
Nobody in it.

<i>[Williams] My favorite thing</i>
<i>about being a cop-</i>
I love it when that perp
get all scared of you.
You draw down on 'em.
They get all scared.
"Oh, she about to kill me.
Don't kill me. Don't kill me."
[Laughs]
I love that.
I became a cop because...
my doctors thought it
would be a good idea...
for me to get out of the house.
I feel like I bring a real, uh,
joie de vivre to law enforcement.
For example, my uniform, uh-
I don't wear the regulation uniform. I-
I wear these, uh, shorts.
[Clears Throat]
And I actually had to lobby the sheriff's
department to get to wear these.
Uh, but my argument was,
hey, I'm out there on the streets.
I gotta be able to move
like a cheetah, you know.
A law enforcement cheetah.
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's move! Move! Move!
We got ourselves a 8-14-
armed person on a roof.
I'll tell you right now,
this is it. This is go time.
This is what working for
the Reno Sheriff's Department is all about.
- Let's do it, people. Move!
- <i>[Siren Whirring]</i>
- We got a situation here, Dangle.
- We got a chicken.
- <i>What?</i>
- Chicken situation.
- <i>That's not an 8-14!</i>
- We got it-We got it wrong.
- <i>Who called in the 8-14?</i>
- I did.
- Just chase him into the jacket, and I'll carry him.
- What's an 8-14?
- <i>Armed person on a roof.</i>
- Well-
- I thought a 8-14 was arson.
- No, armed person on a roof.
- No, no, no, no.
- Okay, okay, okay.
[Clamoring]
- Stop, chicken! Stop!
- [Gunfire]
- <i>Ah, shit!</i>
- <i>Look out!</i>
- [All Ululating]
- I got it. I got him.
- Oh, shit.
- Whoa!
<i>[Williams]</i>
<i>Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!</i>
- Chicken!
- [Shouting]
- No, no!
- I'm just knocking him out, that's all.
- Maybe he'll hold still. We can beat him to death.
- Ready?
Ow! Shit! Whoa!
Can we all shoot
at the same time?
You point and you shoot.
Goddamn.
- Let's shoot at the same time?
- Shoot at the same time.
Okay. That's the only thing that
sort of makes sense.
- One.
- No, I got Dangle's gun. Mine's out too.
- Is yours out?
- Two-And then that way, we-
we'll never know who did it.
Don't start a count
and then stop.
- Oh, sorry.
- Yeah, it's like a execution. Nice.
One-
- Sorry. My bad.
- <i>[Dangle] What the fuck?</i>
One, two-
- What? I didn't know-
- Okay, on-
- Okay, on-
- Ah!
- What?
- I'm out.
- Am I out?
Oh, I wasn't out. Sorry.
I thought I was out!
- They fit that little midget guy.
- Aw, he's shittin'.
- Should I call the newspaper and
have 'em come take our picture?
- No!
You do one on both legs.
I have applied, uh...
nine times...
to the Aspen Sheriff's Department.
Um, I'll tell you this in-
in, uh, the utmost secrecy.
I-I just don't think I can
do it in this town anymore.
You know, Reno's really a lot
like Mayberry on the TV...
except that everybody's on crystal meth
and prostitution's legal.
- [Banging]
- Fuck you!
- Ah, morning, gang.
- Morning.
So, the trustees were
up in the ducts all weekend...
and there should not be...
too many more squirrels up in there.
So that sound that we were all hearing
should, uh- should be gone.
- <i>[Squeaking]</i>
- I hear it.
- No.
- I knew they didn't get all of 'em.
- Want me to get it, Jim?
No more shooting in here.
Have we not been over that?
- Yes. No, we have.
- We don't shoot in here ever, right?
<i>When do we shoot?</i>
<i>When is it okay to shoot in the building?</i>
Never.
- Hey!
- Hmm?
<i>Guess what, guys?</i>
<i>We... have... been invited...</i>
to the American Police
Convention in Miami Beach!
- Oh!
- Oh!
- <i>Is this a joke?</i>
- <i>What?</i>
## [Singing]
- <i>Three days of fun in the sun.</i>
- Why did they invite us?
They invited us this year...
because...
they invited everybody.
- I'll take it.
- So they had to invite us by default. Yes!
[Whooping]
Group hugs. Group hugs.
- <i>I'm gonna pass out.</i>
- <i>We get to stay in a hotel and everything?</i>
- Yeah.
- We do get to fly first class, right?
- <i>[Laughs]</i>
- Come on.
<i>[Williams]</i>
<i>Flyin' in style!</i>
We, um-
We are not flying-
## <i>[Man Singing In Spanish]</i>
I'm pooping.
- [Screams]
- Aah!
- Oh, Christ, I was dreaming.
- Why was your hand on my dick?
I was dreaming that I was driving,
uh, in the Indy 500.
Oh, God! Oh!
## <i>[Continues]</i>
## <i>[Fades]</i>
- Can we go look at the guns?
- Yes, go look at the guns.
I'm gonna get our passes.
Let's all regroup here in 90 seconds.
Oh, my God.
That's the Aspen Sheriff's Department.

I'm in my, uh, civilian rig.

- Name?
Dangle. Lieutenant, uh, uh, Jim-
uh, James Ron Dangle.
Uh, I sent you my résumé and-and some stats
and a couple of letters of recommendation.
- Yeah.
- And, um, about eight or maybe
even nine times actually.
- There were nine.
- Yeah. And you didn't get 'em, I guess.
We got 'em.
Uh, we pass 'em around.
- We have a pretty good laugh.
- [Chuckling]
I didn't believe you were real.
Here he is, guys.
This Dangle thing, I swear to gosh-
We thought it was a joke.
- I haven't seen one thing-
- Mm-hmm.
- in your file-
- Sure.
that would indicate...
our want of you.
So, thanks.
No, thanks.
- I'd love to change your mind on that.
- No, thanks.
Just want to press the- Okay.
Hi. Yeah, could you step away
from the helicopter, please?
Yeah, ma'am, I was just
explaining how I used to fly these...
- during the Marine Corps back in '82, '85.
- Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
Is there someone above you?
You, can I talk to you?
- There's, um- Is there yelling?
- Who are you?
Hi, I'm, uh, Deputy Assistant
Mayor Jeff Spoder.
- And you're-
- Hi. Lieutenant Jim Dangle,
Reno Sheriff's Department.
- <i>Lieutenant</i> Jim Dangle,

- Is his name in the system?
I did it several times.
He is not in the system.
- Trudy did the reservations, right?
- I will do it again.
- You did a name and city search?
- Or not.
- There's no Reno.
- There is a Reno.
- I am aware that there's a Reno.
- We have an airport.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Get him!
- Here we go.
- Go and do it, Trudy.
What the fuck?
- I don't like yelling, okay?
- If you won't give us our laminates...
- can we have at least, please,
our hotel room keys?
- We ain't got no place to stay.
- We've been on a bus for days.
- There's no-
- You're not in there for hotel rooms. Sorry.
- Hotel room keys...
are with the registration packets,
the brochures and the laminates.
And give us all of those
right now, please.
You can't have them because
you're not in my system.
- What are we gonna do?
- You know what?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We don't need these guys.
- No, we don't.
- No.
- Fuck 'em.
- We have each other.
- Well, that wasn't-

I love him.
I have to find who this is.
- Well, no, we gotta go-
- I have to find who this is.
No, we gotta go back

Right. What we need is someone who is
high-ranking in the Miami Beach government.
They're all-
Everyone above me, um, is-
is stuck in the convention center
right now.
You quarantined them in there,
so I'm the acting, uh-
I'm actually-
I'm acting mayor right now.
All right, this is
Acting Mayor Jeff Spoder.
If you need any office supplies,
get some copies made...
a stapler,
it's this guy.
I-I'd like to coordinate with your, um,

I'd love to know where you are at all times

or minus 2,000 law enforcement officers...
<i>from all over this great</i>
<i>United States of America in there.</i>

<i>Anybody?</i>
Jesus Christ.
You're in charge?
Sir, yes, sir. Wh- What are-
What are ya-What's going on?
All right, right now we got the entire
Miami Beach police force in there.

- That means that these streets
right now are unpatrolled.
I need every one of you out there...
answering 911 calls,
patrolling the streets.
Department of Homeland Security

There is no police force of
any kind outside the building?

Holy shit!
Rick Smith, SWAT.
<i>They call me "The Condor."</i>
I'm sorry I'm late to the barbecue.
I was on a mission when I got the call.
<i>Let me ask you a question, people.</i>
What's the difference
between bravery and courage?
- Oh, I know. Bravery is something that you do.
- [Dangle] Shh. Shh.
Cour- Sorry.
Bravery is when
you do something dangerous...
and you're not even scared.
Courage is when you're
smart enough to know...
you should be scared,
but you do it anyway.
Oh.
[Laughs]
You will not fail.
I will not allow you to fail.
Under my watch,
I will not allow you to fail.
As God as my witness,
we will not fail.
Are you with me?
Uh-
- Are you with me?
- Is that-
It's okay. I know what I'm doing.
I know the thing is out of the thing.
This can come out.
This stays like this.
- Okay.
- Are you with me?
- Yes!
- Are you with me?
- Yes!
- How- Okay, the thing.
Okay that came out now for real.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

We got a call about lewd

Lube or lewd?

- Amen.
- And-
Could you go over the middle part again,
what you were doing?
Oh, I'd be- I'd be happy to
repeat the middle part.
- Okay.
- Um, our plan was-
- All right, everyone. Everyone.
Everyone, get back!
- [Clamoring]
Get back!
No, no, put that away!
Close the case. Close the case.
Close the case and give it to me.
- Give me the antidote! Give me the antidote!
- Give him the antidote!
- Okay.
- Sorry.
- Hey, man.
- You're on your own.
- No, you know what you are, man?
- What?
I say, you know what you are?
You're <i>haza</i>.
You're <i>haza</i>, man.
I've understood, like, every third word you've
said to me the whole time I've known you.
And you know what?
I don't really care.
'Cause all of you-
[Laughs]
get a load of Spoder!
[Laughs]
- Oh-
- <i>Whoa!</i>
Okay, okay. Okay.
[Without Accent]
This isn't me. This isn't-
- <i>[Dangle] What happened to your accent?</i>
- <i>[Williams] Whoa.</i>
My name is Ethan.
I live just outside of Denver.
- Shut up!
- Well, not anymore. No, I live here now.
Originally, I'm from Fort Collins.
I was dealing blow
in Colorado, all right?
Uh, but it was a- a fruitless thing to do-
No one cared.
It's hard to sell coke there.
I don't know whether it's the elevation
or just the way of life there.
They're more interested in, uh, like, you know,
mush- mushrooms and acid and stuff.
- This was, uh-
- Hey, there's the, uh- antidote-
- Do you have more of that here
or is it all with him?
- No, he took all of it.
- He has all of the antidote.
- Oh, shit. We should wrap this up.
Like I told you,
I will give you anything you want.
Uh, as long as
I get immunity here. I don't care.
- I'll rat that guy.
- I think we can do that. That's cool.
- I think we can do immunity, right?
- That would be the greatest.
- No immunity to bullets.
- <i>Oh, God!</i>
- <i>[Screaming]</i>
- <i>[Dangle] Oh, God!</i>
[Sighs]
- Let's get him!
- Oh, my God! Get him! Get him!

Shit! She's stuck!
She's stuck!

Go the other way!
Go the other way!
<i>Other way! Other way!</i>
<i>Other way! Other way! Other way!</i>
- Go! Go! Go!
- <i>Hey, what's going on?</i>
- You stay right there, Mrs. Spoder.
- Why are you going away now?
- [Dangle] You're a material witness, Mrs. Spoder!
- <i>We're gonna come back for you.</i>
- Can somebody help me?
- Spoder!
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
- <i>Drop it! Drop it right away, now!</i>
Oh, my God! Jesus!
Hey! Hey!
What the fuck? Did they- Did they run away?
No running away! What the fuck?
- Go! Come on! Go! Go! Go!
- All right, you want a chase?
- [Dangle] He's goin'.

- Oh, time out.

- <i>[Jeff] You don't wanna go where I'm goin'!</i>
- [Dangle] Why not?
- Go to the left!
- Miami cops!
- Ohh! Ohh!

<i>Assholes!</i>

Hey! Hey!
- Watch where you're shooting! Jesus Christ!
- We're between you and him!
[Bell Clanging]
- He's gonna jump that bridge!
- I know. I know.
- He's gonna do it!
- [Jeff] I'm gonna jump it!
- Hammer of the gods!
- [Johnson] He's gonna jump it. Shit!
- Whoa!
- [Dangle] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Oh, that hurts.
- Oh, my neck.
- Everybody, hey, hands up! Hands up!
- [Gunshot]
- [Screams]
- Get down! Get down! Get down!
- No, no, I mean- I mean, stand up!
- <i>Get down?</i>
- No, don't get- I swear to God!
- Tell us what you want us to do, Jeff!
Everyone, stand up and look at me!
Stand up and look at me!
- Stand up and look at you.
- <i>Put your guns down, everyone! Kick 'em away!</i>
- K-Kick your guns away.
- Kick 'em away?
Don't walk after them! Kick them
away from you and stay where you are!
- Kick them and step back?
- Kick them away and step back!
- What are you doing?
- I'm kicking them and stepping back.
Step back!
Guess what?
I'm glad it came to this.
I'm glad that you douche-nozzles
ruined my plan.
Because now I am drunk
on unprecedentedness.
- <i>And th- What, Dangle?</i>
- Unprecedentiality.
- [Machine Gun Firing]
- <i>I will think of some-Stand up!</i>
Final words.
Johnson, go.
Um, um, uh, legalize it?
Great. Fine. Wiegel.
- Okay, when I was in the fourth grade-
- Enough!
- <i>Dangle, last words.</i>
- Uh, he, uh, uh, uh- he loved it.
- <i>Great.</i>
- Shit!
- All right, no, that's your last words.
- <i>Jeff-Jeff, no, no!</i>
- That's your last words.
- That's not my last words! My last words-
- Here we go. Ready?
- <i>[Kimball] No, I think you</i>
<i>should talk to him more!</i>
[Jones On P.A.]
Anybody call for backup? Yeah!
[Garcia On P.A.]
"El departmento de sheriff."
Die, you whirlybird motherfuckers!
<i>[Garcia]</i>
<i>No, I got it. Shit. Hold on.</i>
<i>Goddamn- No, I got it.</i>
<i>Shit. Son of a bitch.</i>
<i>[Jeff] I give up, whirlybird!</i>
<i>I give up, whirlybird!</i>
- Whoo! Ha, ha!
- <i>[Wiegel] We did it!</i>
[Laughing]
- [Laughing Continues]
- I need the extender!
I need the- another set of cuffs.
He's too chubby to fit 'em.
Yeah!
[Laughing]
I'm not chubby.
This is protective karate fat.
- Protective karate fat. You know what?
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Tell it to the judge, Spoder.
Nice work, people.
Nice work, indeed.
You know, I know we're probably not
the smartest bunch of cops in the whole world.
Probably not the best trained.
Probably not the smartest bunch
of cops in the whole world.
<i>Individually, I don't think</i>
<i>we look like much-</i>
- a couple of colored people,
some white folks, a lesbian.
- Sir, I'm not-
But I- I think
the important thing is-
<i>Know what we are?</i>
<i>Does anybody know what we are?</i>
- A squad?
- Gorgeous.
- Squad. Gorgeous.
- People.
- People. All sort of right.
- Broke.
- Rope?
- Broke.
Broke. All pretty accurate.
- Heroes.
- I thought you said rope.
Heroes- Can I fini- Okay, can I fuckin' finish
the thing I was gonna say?
<i>[Junior]</i>
<i>Shit!</i>
That was my bad.
- Was that the one Jeff was in?
- Yeah.
- Anybody-
- Double-time. Double-time.
Double-time. Double-time.
Trudy. Trudy, double-time.

- Hi.

Look, you don't have to thank us.
I know.
You did your job. Barely.
So what?
Well, good ridd- riddance
to you too. I mean-
These were literally right in front of me.
<i>[Williams]</i>
<i>He's getting his badge.</i>
[Cheering]

Best sheriff's department in the world.
I bet we're gonna make
the national real deal.
- We rock.
- Dangle. Can I talk to you?
- You could-
- Yeah. Sure.
You're something to behold
when you are in action.
I'm impressed.
And I have been wrong about you.
I want to make it right.
I want to invite you to
the Aspen Sheriff's Department.
We'd like you to join us.
[Sighs]
Sheriff Wagner...
the Reno Sheriff's Department
isn't just my coworkers...
they're like my family.
But they're also...
the dumbest group of people I've ever met
who weren't legally retarded.
So I- I would like a new family.
And I'd like that family
to be you guys.
- You're awesome. Yes, I accept.
Thank you very much.
- Boys.
Guys, I'll see you!
I'm going, uh, to Aspen.
- What?
- Well, when are you gonna be back?
Uh, won't. Won't be back. I'm taking a job
at the Aspen Sheriff's Department.
- <i>[Wiegel] What?</i>
- You're quittin'?
Yeah. I'm not quitting.
No. I mean, well, I am.
Jim, you're just gonna leave me here?
- No, I'm gonna leave all of you here.
- I love you.
- I know. I know. You've always loved me. It's fine.
- Oh.
I'll see you guys.
Where do you guys ski?
Do you guys ski Ajax
or do you guys ski Snowmass?
- Hold mine too.
- Sure was a good time.
- <i>[Williams] Oh, he's not holding your bag.</i>
- Whoo!
- [Johnson] Hey, Terry.
- ## [Humming]
- <i>What are you doing here?</i>
- Terry was giving tug jobs
on the East Coast out here.
He says he's out here
recording his album.
I am recording my album.
See, I have a violin.
- <i>[Wiegel] Mm-hmm. That's a ukulele, Terry.</i>
- Your mom's a ukulele, Terry.
We're getting on the bus and going back home.
We're not in the mood for your high jinks.
I'm not taking the bus, 'cause
A: it smells like farts.
B: I have my own jet, okay,
that my dad bought me for Flag Day.
- I already told you that.
- Terry, you gonna take your limo?
<i>I'll take my limo.</i>
<i>Yes, that's correct.</i>
And my limo driver, Barry Baum.
- <i>Your limo driver Barry Baum-</i>
- That's his name. Barry Baum.
- <i>is gonna take you to your private jet?</i>
- Here it is. Oh.
Hey, look at my "lim'."
It just appeared.
- Hi, Barry Baum.
- Sir.
- Sir, is your name, in fact, Barry Baum?
- Thank you.
I'm Barry Baum, yes.
You guys want a ride or do you
want to ride in the fartmobile?
- I got shotgun!
- No, let's go.
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
Whoo!
Here it is!
- Super Terry Airlines.
- [Jones] Oh, my God.
- Come onboard. It's so fucking sweet.
- Holy fuck!
- Ta-da!

- Fuck you, Dad.
Fuck you.
[Laughing]
- Do you like the new album or what?
- I love the new album.
- Listening party. Monaco.
- Oh, sign me up.
- I like the hair. It's so Stamos.
- Thank you. Thank you. Who's your friends?
These are my friends from Reno.
They're the police officers.
Nice to meet you, sir.
You have a wonderful son.
Oh, thank you.
I know I got a wonderful son.
We've arrested him several times
for giving blow jobs on the street corner.
- Quick impression.
- That's you.
<i>Is this, uh, really,</i>
<i>uh, his jet up here?</i>
This is his jet. I gave it to him
as a gift for Flag Day, remember?
I do remember. Oh, that was a great Flag Day.
Probably my best one.
- <i>The Jacuzzi's on.</i>
- We can get a ride?
- Sure.
- Thank you, sir.
- I didn't believe you. I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I love you guys.
- <i>[Williams] Oh, my God!</i>
- [Junior] Thank you, Terry.
- Oh, wow.
- <i>[Jones] Whoo!</i>
- <i>[Laughing]</i>
- <i>Whoo!</i>
Um, as you know, we have, uh...
faced violence and danger
on a daily basis...
- throughout our career, uh, via weapons...
- [Chattering]
such as knives, shivs, forks,
things like that.
The department wants us
to be aware of something else.
They have issued us, uh...
a requirement to carry Handi sanitary wipes
for the deadly fluids.
## <i>[Humming]</i>
Hi, guys.

I'll take it from here.
- Thank you. Thank you, guys.

<i>[Dangle]</i>
<i>I wanna- [Sighs]</i>
I got out to Colorado...
and I went out, uh, and stood...
at the top of a mountain
they- they call Ajax.
And I looked down the mountain,
and I looked at all the runs.
And I could see the way
that the runs intertwined.
- They found out you were a-
- Yeah, they did. Mm-hmm.
Yeah. They got a zero tolerance
on that one over there.
I just want to say
I know that, um-
I know that you came back for me.
And I appreciate it.
- We'll talk later.
- Okay.
- Sorry, gang.
- <i>[Dangle] It's okay.</i>
<i>No better way to show your affection</i>
<i>than a quick... wiener cupping.</i>
- Hey, Jim, you know what you
missed while you weren't here?
- <i>What's that?</i>
- Pajama Tuesdays.
- Oh, sweet!
Which, uh, she was only one
who really participated in.
And I think that she did not do it on purpose,
but then tried to play it off as Pajama Tuesday.
<i>[Dangle]</i>
<i>Hey, gang! Amazing news.</i>
Oh, my God. We have been invited to
take part in Handcuffs Across the Water.
- <i>[Gasps]</i>
- We're going to Scotland Yard!

- <i>[All Cheering]</i>
<i>[Gunshot]</i>
All week long I've been
looking for this guy.
And he's on my boob,
and he's on my boob forever, you know.
And I don't-
I don't know who this is.
I don't know who this is,
but damn it, Garcia...
- I just thought finally, you know, I can-
- Yeah. Yeah.
- can come home to somebody.
- <i>My God, I had the same thing</i>
<i>happen to me. I-</i>
Right there.
- Kinda.
- You got a tattoo.
- Please, go on the other side
of the fence. You don't want-
- On the other side of the fence?
I want to find out what
your half lives like. Lulu!

You wouldn't dare shoot me.
And I'll prove it.

Look at you! Wow.
You are, uh, in high school.
Junior high. I'll be 14 next month.
I missed seventh grade.
[Laughing]
Hey! Fourteen! Next month!

Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Tell me the truth.
You are a lesbian, right?
I ain't gonna tell nobody.
I don't know how many times
or how many ways I have to say this.
I am not a lesbian.
I'm pretty sure she is.
Get back on your Commie fuckin' raft,
and get the hell back to Cuba.
And you know what?
Tell Castro we said, "Hey, what's up?"
- [Gunshots]

[Phone Rings]
You know you're going
through X-ray, don't you?
How does it work?
What the hell kind of a-
- Oh, see, it's like that.
You put it in, and then you-
- Don't- Don't do that.
- Okay. What's that for?
- This gets the resin out, and then you- Here.
- You suck the resin off. Get high.
- Don't, don't, don't-
But you can also do a shotgun-
You can shotgun it too.
Well, wait, I can- No, you shotgun it
off of here. You light the middle.
- And then you light it, and you go-
- Oh, that's shotgunnin' it.
- Double bong. Double bong.
- <i>Please- Please don't do that.</i>
- You suck on that. You suck on this end.
- That end right there-
- And then you-
- Okay, no-
- What does it do?
- That is inserted in the anus...
and then you pull this to extract
impacted fecal matter.
I'm a proctologist.

Feel like Jeff Gordon or something
