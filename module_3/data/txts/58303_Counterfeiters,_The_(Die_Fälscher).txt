THE COUNTERFEITERS
THE WAR IS OVER
BEAUTIFUL SHORE
Monsieur Sorowitsch?
I'm afraid we require a deposit.
$200 is more than enough.
Is this your first visit
to Monte Carlo?
Excellent.
That's going to be fine.
Little adjustment here, that's all.
PRIVATE ROOM
Cheers.
What's that?
You're not from a camp,
are you?
I'm not a...
Sally!
Schmitz!
Where's the other 150?
Know how risky it is
off-loading your duds?
Sally!
Can you lend me something?
Twenty?
Come over all political?
Ludwig here took me along
to a meeting.
Heil! Heil! Heil!
And I've joined them too!
Look!
He gave it to me
'cause I'm so kind to him!
In bed or in the party?
You see, Schmitz...
if I let you cheat me, tomorrow
someone else will cheat me.
Soon they'll all cheat me.
It's not about the 150.
It's a matter of principle.
It's about my very existence,
and for that I could be driven...
to take extreme measures.
Sally, you old crook!
Let me introduce
an old friend of mine!
Sally Sorowitsch, the most
charming scoundrel in Berlin!
Sorowitsch?
Are you Russian?
I hope you're not a Communist?
Enough of a Communist
to share my champagne with you.
Sally--that's a droll sort of name.
Where does it come from?
It's short for Salomon.
Salomon?
She can spit the champagne back.
It's a Rothschild.
I'm trusting you.
What do they always say?
Don't do business with Jews!
Trying so hard not to be noticed
gets you noticed.
Not learnt that yet
in the Resistance?
I'm sorry, Sally.
- In two hours up at my place.
- OK, Sally.
You're leaving?
Tonight.
Got a tip-off.
Been here too long.
Crack the dollar
and you can do anything.
It's not quite perfect.
But one of these days...
Have you got the money?
That's what we wanted
to talk to you about.
- They're our people.
- Our people?
I'm me and the others
are the others.
Don't you see
what's going on around you?
What the Nazis are doing to us?
Know why the Jews
are always persecuted?
Because they refuse to adapt!
It's not that hard.
- Sally, don't you have any--
- No.
Need a certificate of Aryan purity?
I'll do one proving you descend
from Siegfried and the Dragon.
Do you know Schiele?
I even met him once,
in Vienna.
A great master.
Your pictures.
I don't believe
you're such an asshole.
Who'd have thought it?
Hans using beautiful women...
Listen--
The jewelry's
not even worth half.
I need an Argentinean passport.
- I've already packed.
- Hans, you can go.
I'll settle this with Mr. Sorowitsch.
You're lucky...
wanting an Argentinean passport.
The home of tango.
You could be a really great artist.
What do you know about it?
A great deal.
Otherwise I wouldn't have stayed.
Why earn money by making art?
Earning money by making money
is far easier.
I have to go.
May I?
Friedrich Herzog, Berlin CID,
Counterfeit Squad.
It is a great honor
to arrest the world's
best counterfeiter,
if that is any consolation.
The dollar!
Bitten off more
than we can chew, eh?
Go on!
Get up, you lazy Jewish bastard!
Get up, will you!
You there!
Get rid of that vermin!
They're out to get us.
This is no jail.
They're going to kill us.
They're out to get us.
The Kapo:
Melzer.
Watch out for him.
A murderer.
The ones with the green triangle...
habitual criminals,
worse than the SS.
But you don't look like a--
If you touch me I'll cut your throat.
I'll be watching you,
you filthy swine.
I'll get you!
Are you crazy?
You can't just--
He has to respect me,
but not lose face.
The same as in any other jail.
On your feet!
Who did this?
Number 75517.
I like it.
You've caught it well, Jew.
- It would be better in color.
- What?
It would be better in color,
Herr Unterscharführer.
The sheen of the boots.
Drawn from memory.
What's all this?
Herr Hauptsturmführer, it's...
It's like this, I...
FIVE YEARS LATER
Sorowitsch!
Look at this.
I thought a Styrian jacket
would look good!
I can paint whatever you want,
Herr Sturmbannführer.
You're being moved.
Sachsenhausen. Tomorrow.
But the picture isn't finished.
I have to finish the picture.
So the maggot's afraid
of losing its bacon!
A dirty little Jew like you
can fix himself up anywhere!
Stinks to high heaven, that Jew!
Food.
I always admired
the Russian avant-garde.
Kandinsky, Rodchenko!
At the academy in Odessa
we had a professor called Lebed.
In my time,
Lebed was a junior lecturer.
You were at the academy?
You're Russian too?
I don't like speaking Russian.
Reminds me of bad times.
You prefer to speak German?
I had a family.
We used to say,
Lebed and good art
is like a virgin and good...
Fucking.
So you know that one too!
Number 75517.
Salomon Sorowitsch.
The King of Counterfeiters!
SS Sturmbannführer Herzog.
Don't you remember? Herzog?
CID Berlin, Counterfeit Squad.
I arrested you!
It got me promoted!
What size are you?
48.
- Shoe size?
- 42.
Welcome to Sachsenhausen!
Name, profession, size?
Burger, printer.
Collotype. 52.
More like 46/48 now.
Shoe size?
41.
No, thanks.
A non-smoker! As you wish.
Much healthier!
Name, profession, size?
Welcome to Sachsenhausen.
We use a different tone
here in my domain
than in the camps
you've just come from.
I'd like to regard you
as coworkers here.
Together we're going to...
Yes.
The clothes are secondhand.
You can wear prison stripes
if you prefer.
After all,
stripes flatter the figure!
What's his name?
What the hell was that for?
A symbolic gesture--
to get us shot?
My dear Jews...
today I bring you a specialist
of international standing,
Salomon Sorowitsch.
He will supervise
the retouching department!
"Operation Bernhard."
Counterfeit money
on a huge scale.
ID cards, documents, banknotes...
all to the latest technical standards.
I expect the newcomers will want
to freshen up and relax?
Our foreman here, dear old Atze,
will show you around.
I wish you every success!
Another fine speech by
Herr Sturmbannführer.
Fine beds.
Why are they giving us
such fine beds?
It's still a concentration camp.
But the beds are soft.
That's good.
"Anny Ondra will only wash
with Sarinol."
I was a commercial photographer.
Quiet in here, isn't it?
One forgets what it's like.
Where are they all running to?
The shoe-testing squad.
They make the prisoners
run in a circle...
to test the shoes.
Test them? How?
It's a punishment. The shoes are
too small, sandbags on their backs.
Many of them die.
Best not to even listen.
Music!
Right lads, I'll show you
where you'll be working!
We've got men here from all
different camps. All professional--
graphic artists, printers,
retouchers, copper engravers.
Why are they using Jews
for the work?
I assume
they mean to kill us after the war.
To keep it under wraps.
A genuine platen press.
Worked with one before?
Lazy bastards!
Faster, you idle riffraff!
It's OK. He's Dr. Klinger,
our Kapo.
The SS need to hear him
yelling at us.
The new arrivals?
Dr. Klinger, internal medicine.
Welcome to the Golden Cage.
Come and see me
at once, young man.
That foot looks bad...
really bad!
I wept too, the first time
I saw a printing press again.
Reminds you
you're a human being.
Zilinski, darkroom.
Matti, show him the ropes.
Karloff?
Graphics section. Through there,
straight ahead. You can't miss it.
Us two beauties...
are going to Quality Control.
Dr. Viktor Hahn, Royal Prussian
Credit Bank, Hamburg.
Mr. Sorowitsch will supervise
the retouching section.
You're also
from the financial sector?
Our main problem is the paper.
It has the wrong feel.
The English paper has the same
structure as a kind of Turkish linen.
We've experimented
with various chemicals,
but the results
remain unsatisfactory.
A green triangle?
A habitual criminal, Herr Laube?
Sorowitsch is--if one can say so--
a "professional" counterfeiter.
Till now the only criminals here
were those wearing
Nazi uniforms, my good man.
So it besmirches your honor
having to work with a jailbird?
If honor is all one has left!
You'll have a hard time here.
And that's a promise.
Fuck you.
A weekend off!
And a shower on Sunday!
Fraternizing
with a common criminal?
The true criminals
are the capitalist exploiters.
They're the ones
who made Fascism possible.
If a proletarian steals bread
to feed his children...
That's not exactly what I did.
You gave a comrade
your slice of bread.
That was solidarity.
That was soup.
A low number.
How did you survive
so long in Auschwitz?
A good work detail.
What about a game?
- What are we playing for?
- For honor's sake.
I win even when I don't cheat.
What are you doing,
you idle bastard?
This isn't a rest home!
You're here to work!
Understood?
Holst!
Leave him be!
Thinking can also be work, Holst!
Try it yourself sometime.
All amateurs and idiots.
Forget the circumstances
for a moment.
It's just you and me.
The most perfect forgeries ever.
First the pound...
and then the dollar!
Men, machines, material--
whatever you need!
You see, Sorowitsch...
there are ways of surviving here.
I can't guarantee it
for the others, but for you...
if...
Gentlemen, can't you stop that
nigger music?
As if there
weren't any German music!
One more before bedtime.
Why isn't God in Auschwitz?
He didn't get through
the selection process!
Kanada.
The low number.
I was in the Kanada work detail.
We sorted the luggage
on the platform.
We took the food in the bags
while the people it belonged to
were being gassed.
One adapts or dies.
I can't go on like this.
We have it so good in here...
while out there...
My wife is still in Auschwitz.
I won't give the Nazis the pleasure
of being ashamed I'm still alive.
All prisoners to remain
in their barracks!
Allegedly not even the commandant
knows what we do in here!
...will be shot immediately!
...anything, as long as
we aren't put out here again.
Anything...
What's the matter?
They're going to gas us!
We're too valuable,
they won't harm us.
Come on, get undressed.
Come on!
Burger!
Can you hear me?
Are you hurt?
Get up.
- Leave him, Burger! Come here!
- Dr. KIinger!
You there!
What are you doing here?
Did any of them speak to you?
Did anybody speak to you?
Number 64000.
- I asked if anybody here spoke to you.
- He was lying on the...
Shut your face.
Did he speak to you?
- I don't know him.
- What did he say?
God, are you dumb!
You come with me.
What did you say to him?
It's forbidden to speak
to other prisoners.
Mr. Burger
is our only collotype expert.
He didn't speak to him either.
Go and shower.
Go and shower!
I just wanted to help him.
Move!
They're going to gas us.
Gas... I can smell it.
Water! It's water!
Odessa?
For you!
Please excuse,
about today in shower.
Reminds me a bit of Lukanov.
Yes.
Do you know his city views?
Colors!
A pity there are no colors here.
For me Odessa is blue, dark blue!
In the academy they said
my style is bad.
But it's my art.
Even if it only pleases me.
Let me have a look.
I can do better than that.
Let me try again.
Number 93--
Have you settled in yet?
Got everything you need?
The ID cards we're supposed
to produce--
the problem's
the cover and the paper.
If we could have used originals...
You must now devote
all your efforts to the pound!
It's important
we get results soon.
Himmler is growing impatient.
What's this?
My 5-year-old could do better!
I'm a rail track layer.
I said I was a printer
to get out of Sobibor.
They couldn't translate
my ID card. Help me!
Paracystosis,
a material defect in the copper.
Loszek is a specialist
in relief printing.
He could be transferred
to the ID card section.
Paracystosis.
Or we could have him shot.
Beat it!
Never try to deceive me again,
Sorowitsch.
We're on the same side now.
Is this some
of the Turkish linen?
Yes. I thought--
Throw that away.
Rags!
The English use rags!
Fibers, torn and abraded
thousands of times!
Hardly any of the English
use wallets.
They pin the notes together
with safety pins.
That's why we're making
the little holes here at the edges.
Negative retouching.
It's not just a matter of slipping
a few notes past a shop assistant.
We intend to flood and destroy
Britain's economy.
If they realize we're using
forged notes...
that'll be the end of the operation.
We'd have to send you back...
to the camps.
She wasn't wearing any knickers!
Just imagine, a photo shoot with
an agent, producer, and everything,
and that hot little tart
with no knickers! Skirt like this.
"Doesn't the gentleman
want to take another shot?"
"Sure. I won't even need a tripod."
You're standing in the sun.
If we fail to bring off the pound...
we should organize ourselves!
There's a lot of us.
We're well nourished,
we're strong, we could fight!
We've got tools.
With retouching knives?
Against an SS company?
Rather than let them gas us!
I'd rather be gassed tomorrow
than shot for nothing today.
A day is a day.
A revolt would at least be a sign!
Zilinski's right.
You're standing in the sun.
Kolya?
When did the fever start?
Sometimes fever is bad.
In between, it's OK.
We've had TB cases here before.
I asked for drugs, and...
Kleinfeld, Stiasny, Jilovsky.
All shot, because of
the risk of infection.
Can you help him?
I'll see what I...
Without the right drugs...
Isolate him.
I'm a doctor--
internal medicine!
Bad sickness?
No, no.
The doctor will make it better.
I have to live to see
when the camp is over.
Exactly!
Bring some dressings, fast!
Those original documents
you asked for.
The crates came from Auschwitz.
Loszek found
his children's passports.
This is pointless!
You have to survive.
Only by surviving
can we defeat them!
You have to survive!
Loszek, you must survive!
Wake up!
Assemble for roll call outside!
Filthy Jewish scum!
Outside!
Get out!
Sorry to wake you,
but I have a story to tell.
A few days ago, a businessman
went into a bank in Zurich.
He was carrying a small case...
full of money.
Pound notes.
Our agent asks to open an account
with his British pounds.
Of course, Monsieur.
But you must understand,
for reasons of security,
we have to check
the authenticity of these notes.
But of course!
In times like these...
For half an hour,
Swiss bank experts scrutinized
our little printed products,
with a vengeance.
Your bank notes.
Our examination has confirmed
that as far as we can tell...
they are...
genuine!
Wait, it's not over yet.
Our agent gets cocky!
Monsieur le Directeur...
since I received these notes
from an admittedly
rather dubious source...
I'd prefer to have
absolute certainty.
Our bank
will accept your money.
- There is no need--
- Absolute certainty, Monsieur.
If you insist,
then I suggest we have the notes
checked by the Bank of England.
The Bank of England!
Let's see what they have
to carp about.
Maybe we'll get a few tips.
"After thorough examination,
we conclude
"that the bank notes
submitted by you
"in denominations of £5,
"£10, and £20 sterling...
"are not forgeries.
The Bank of England herewith
guarantees their authenticity."
Reichsführer SS Himmler
is very pleased with our efforts.
These duds are so perfect
our plans have changed.
They're too good to be
simply dropped over England.
The German Reich will use them
for its long-term currency dealings!
And in turn
this gave me the idea...
of giving you a little pleasure.
As an incentive, so to speak.
I thought perhaps...
after work, or...
at the weekend?
On behalf of all the men, I'd like
to thank you for all our privileges.
Motivation, Klinger, motivation!
I'm interested in managing people;
that's where the future lies.
If you treat people like dirt,
they won't work.
And if you treat dirt like people...
You Jews--tricks and fakery,
that's what you're good at.
If one scratches just a bit
at that respectable façade...
Herr Sturmbannführer.
All my life I've been
an upright citizen.
I must point out that
here I am being coerced
into performing dishonest acts.
Excellent work, Sorowitsch.
Set up a new working group
for the dollar!
Can't anyone see
what's happening?
The Germans are bankrupt.
No foreign currency means
no gasoline, no raw materials.
- We're financing the Nazi war effort!
- So?
Are you suggesting sabotage?
In a concentration camp?
The Americans use rotogravure,
we're using collotype...
in order to produce
large amounts quickly.
Collotype is good for definition
and halftones.
There are still some problems,
but we're dealing with them.
Thankfully we have
an expert in this field.
A score to settle with the dollar?
You know it was the dollars
that led to your arrest.
Back then, I didn't have
the technical means.
And now?
How much do you need?
Maybe a few hundred million.
You cheap whore!
Just be thankful you're in here,
you idiot!
Shit, shit, shit!
Maybe it's not the negative
but your gelatin.
Sorowitsch's negative
was perfect, as always.
But why...?
My wife and I were sent to Auschwitz
for printing anti-Nazi flyers.
I'm not going to print money
for the Nazis.
Look...
my family, small business...
always careful, never any
problems with the authorities.
Kept my nose out of politics.
Gisela, my wife, always said...
the reason we're printers
is to print the truth!
Where did you learn that slogan?
The Communist Printers' League,
youth section?
If we print millions of dollars,
it could decide the war.
We could contribute to fighting
the Nazis here...
that wouldn't be
just a symbolic gesture!
We're alive.
- That's worth a hell of a lot.
- Exactly.
Isn't it about more
than your own shitty little life?
Our shitty life
is the only thing we have.
Is this about surviving, or proving
that you can forge the dollar?
I'll keep on
destroying your negatives.
You can squeal to Herzog
if you want.
We'll have to pay for it
if we don't deliver!
All of us will pay!
Yes.
Warsaw!
The bastards
are being driven back!
Carry on!
So you're failing with the dollar?
We're still having problems
with the gelatin,
Herr Hauptscharführer.
We can do the pound
without you now.
And you know what you are
without the dollar?
Nothing but criminal
Jewish scum.
Fuck Herzog and his "motivation."
I'd soon make you knuckle under.
You're such filthy swine.
Stoop to anything
to save your wretched lives.
Nauseating.
Plappler.
Get Hotte. A basin's broken--
maybe he can repair it.
I saved all our butts
by forging the pound for the Nazis.
Dr. Klinger said you must eat well.
What for?
One for the Expressionists.
One for the Avant-garde.
Eat, or I'll flatten you.
You certainly know
how to bring up children.
What happened to your family?
Deported, killed?
I could've bought their release,
if I'd had money.
14 to 6. Burger to serve.
Get up!
Keep running!
What's going on?
Herr Rottenführer,
I was about to--
What are you waiting for?
No, please not...!
Are you crazy, soldier?
Stand at attention!
Your name, cretin?
Rottenführer Wegener,
Herr Hauptscharführer.
Why are you shooting here?
What if you'd hit one of my Jews?
Play!
15 to 6.
It's a concentration camp.
Dozens are murdered here every day.
Let's just stop up our ears!
16 to 6.
One of thousands.
Just be thankful we're
on this side of the wall, Sally.
Look at that!
If you don't survive here
why survive at all?
Atze has just told me why we still have
no results after so many months.
The gelatin, Herr Sturmbannführer.
It melts.
Oh, yes!
I've already heard that lie
from the other Jew there.
Are you trying to sabotage?
- We're doing everything--
- Hold your tongue!
Don't think you're irreplaceable!
Right.
Berlin is demanding the dollar.
Those five there.
Klinger, take down their names!
If there's no dollar in four weeks,
those five will be shot
and five others selected.
Not Sorowitsch, that one.
Don't believe
I can't dispense with you.
By the way, Klinger.
It's Carnival time!
What about having an evening's fun,
with music, dancing,
cabaret, a knees-up!
I'm sure a few talented men
can be found!
Herr Sturmbannführer!
I've always done my best.
He won't kill anyone. He's got to deliver,
so he's blackmailing us.
- What would you do in his position?
- Me in his position?
I'd never be in the position
of an SS criminal.
It's Burger.
I suspect he's deliberately...
Yesterday I saw him...
- He's sabotaging them. I know.
- What?
But if he doesn't stop...
Herzog saved our lives.
He plays fair.
- One can talk to him.
- You'll hold your tongue, Zilinski.
- One doesn't betray one's mates.
- Mates?
We're to die for the ideals
of that shitty political ideologue?
Sit down.
Burger the hero!
He's always determined
to play the martyr.
That's fine for him,
but not with me!
I lost four toes to frostbite
in Buchenwald.
They broke my back in Dachau.
More than once
I nearly died of starvation.
I deserve to survive this too!
One never squeals on one's mates.
Never!
What's this?
Jailbirds' honor?
If you betray him, I'll kill you.
We've delayed the dollar by months.
You've had your fun.
But now our mates' lives
are at stake.
You can't just...
Gisela...
my wife.
She was in Auschwitz too.
Shot trying to escape.
I'm...
You're sorry?
Thanks.
But now it's the dollar!
We have to go on.
It's a matter of...
our comfortable life here.
Of these fine beds.
These fine...
soft beds!
I thought I'd be able to cry.
Serious but stable.
A race against time.
But without medication...
What do you need?
- But how...?
- The drugs!
In Theresienstadt...
there were never enough drugs.
I had to decide...
who was healed...
and who died.
Herzog's a crook.
I know how to handle him.
Need an invitation, or what?
How nice that you could come!
For goodness' sake
take the handcuffs off him.
Chilly, isn't it?
How I wish certain East Coast circles
in America could see you!
You've no idea
of the dreadful propaganda
being circulated about the camps!
Friedrich, do pour Herr Soritsch
another cup of tea!
Do you take candy sugar--
as a Jew?
Friedrich told me you were
a dangerous criminal...
and now?
Serving a noble cause!
I don't understand anything
about politics, but...!
Now, children...
we must leave Daddy
and his visitor alone.
Leni, Lotte...
and little Friedrich.
Bringing up children...
making responsible individuals
of them,
who take charge of their lives.
I don't hit my children.
Ever.
Words are enough...
and setting
a good example oneself.
That's what counts, Sorowitsch.
After all, who knows
what the future will bring?
If the Russians come...
one will just have to fight anew
for one's place in society.
Do you know...
I used to be--a long,
long time ago--a Communist.
Liberty, equality, human rights--
the whole caboodle!
And don't get the idea
that I'm a Nazi!
No, no.
No more grand ideals.
I do my work where I'm needed.
Do you understand?
Everyone has to look out
for himself.
You must produce the dollar!
Any longer and I can't--
I know about the sabotage.
I know you won't betray your friends.
But I must deliver the goods.
Whatever the price.
Who's it for?
And then I get the dollar?
You Jews!
You'd even bargain
with a comrade's life!
By the way, that Burger--
Absolutely trustworthy.
Collotype.
Our most important man.
Only six days left.
Will you do the dollar?
Leibowitz is a rotogravure printer.
Show him how, so you don't have to--
No, Zilinski.
We have a responsibility
towards our families
and our comrades...
- because we've got it so good.
- I can't listen to this crap any longer!
So you decide
that we get ourselves shot?
It's the principle.
Nobody's prepared
to die for a principle.
That's why the Nazis'
system works!
You will do the fucking dollar!
Well...
let's see what progress
has been made.
Herr Sturmbannführer...
we're still having problems
with the gelatin.
Herr Sturmbannführer,
no, it's like this.
Burger...
See if you can tell
which are the genuine ones.
The dollar!
That is brilliant!
Your masterpiece!
Using collotype we could produce
a million a week?
Now that is a nice surprise
for Carnival!
I knew you could be relied upon!
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me give you a very warm welcome
to our 1945 Carnival Show.
From the world's
most expensive stage!
Try not to cough
when Herzog's around.
You always wanted colors!
Listen...
here's another one...
you've not heard this one yet.
A nun goes to the gynecologist
with a hamster...
Wait, I haven't finished yet!
That you all owe your lives to me,
for getting you out of...
- Auschwitz, Mauthausen...
- The drugs?
Name, place of birth, in capitals.
SWISS PASSPORT
Put "Jew" as well,
to be on the safe side.
You should take care
you don't get infected.
Ultimately, your survival
is what it's all about!
These are difficult times.
It's no longer easy for me either.
Wonderful!
This will give us a chance.
Where's Kolya?
How old are you?
Twenty.
And where are you from?
Odessa.
The Black Sea, how lovely.
Kneel down.
Karloff had TB,
a very dangerous,
infectious disease.
He was endangering
the health of you all,
so I had to shoot him.
For your own good, lads!
We smoked a cigarette together.
He knew
what was going to happen.
I tell you,
he was really brave.
A Jew...
but he died like a man!
But now, let's forget about it!
Sturmbannführer Herzog
has had to leave,
but he left me these to give you.
So let's thank him for that
with three cheers!
Carry on as you were!
Stop work!
Stop work immediately!
Dismantle the machines!
The Exakt platen press,
the rotopress,
and the Boston press
must be loaded first.
We must find out--
Didn't I express myself
clearly enough?
I said dismantle the machines!
You've got exactly six days
to dismantle and pack everything!
Anything not working afterwards
counts as sabotage!
What's wrong with you?
Get them moving!
Standing there
like stuffed dummies.
The Exakt platen press,
the rotopress, and the Boston press
must be loaded first.
Herr Hauptscharführer,
where are we being moved?
How dare you?
Think we're a travel agency?
Are you stupid, or what?
A stupid fucking Jew!
Hurry up!
Those aren't aircraft bombs.
They're not aircraft bombs,
it's artillery!
The Allies are outside Berlin!
If the war's ending, they'll kill us.
Lads!
The machines will be
taken to a safe hiding place.
Secret caves in the Alps.
You'll be following on.
Hand these out to the men!
Don't worry, men!
We'll all be fine
come the Final Victory!
The shoe-testing squad.
They're not there anymore.
What are you doing here?
I forgot something.
Sorowitsch, I warn you.
If I'm harmed,
you'll all be liquidated!
I'm your only chance of surviving!
Do you want the money?
We can share the money!
Is it about Kolya?
It was Holst who shot him!
I know you think
Holst was only following orders.
But what do you think I did?
I always treated you well!
No other prisoners
were treated so well as here!
I can't save the entire
Jewish race on my own!
One has to look after oneself.
You know that better than anyone.
You've pissed yourself.
What's happened here, Sally?
Herzog.
- You haven't...?
- I wanted to kill him, but...
I let him go.
They'll put us up against a wall.
That would've suited you,
wouldn't it?
If they'd shot you too.
It's over.
The war's over.
No one will come for us now.
I'm just not cut out
to play the martyr.
Got any cards?
Our people have taken over
the camp! This is the end.
We're free!
Dr. Klinger, internal medicine.
We're the inmates
from Blocks 18 and 19.
I know him! He's SS!
No, no, no!
Operation Bernhard.
- We're prisoners!
- Mow them down, the scum!
We're Jews.
Shoot them, the fat pigs!
Here!
Jewish nose, big ears!
Don't shoot.
We're prisoners.
Here, Auschwitz!
Who else was in Auschwitz?
We let the negatives
for the dollar overheat,
to make the contours blur.
They threatened to shoot us.
This is Burger!
He's a hero!
Say something!
And then it was too late!
The dollar would have changed
the course of the war.
They'd have had heaps of dough.
Sometimes we heard
that lovely music.
We made the pound here.
Clever, eh?
I told him he had to keep going.
I only said...
he had to survive
until it was over.
What an idiot.
Best get away from here.
Forget all about it!
Where do I take him?
He's dead.
Full house.
Full house.
To change?
No, for the staff.
May I offer you a bottle
of champagne on the house?
You had bad luck?
So much money!
So much money!
We can always
make us some more.
The Sachsenhausen
counterfeiting workshop
forged pound notes to
a total value of £132 million...
equivalent to four times Britain's
foreign currency reserves.
Thanks to the inmates'
delaying tactics,
only a very small number
of dollars was produced.
"Operation Bernhard" remains
the largest counterfeiting
operation of all time.
