<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>There's no guarantee, yeah</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Smile's in the makin'</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>You gotta fight
the powers that be</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Got so many forces</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Stayin' on the scene, yeah</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Givin' up all around me</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Faces full o' pain</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I try to play my music</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>They say my music's too loud</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I tried talkin' about it</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I got the big run around</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>And when I rolled
with the punches</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I got knocked on the ground</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>By all this bullshit going down</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Hey!</i></font>

<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>We gotta fight

<font face="Trebuchet MS">Huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God.
It means cover me, go left.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Read the manual, why don't you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wait for my three count.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">One... two...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Unbelievable.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">FBI! Freeze!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hands on top of your head!
On your head!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Surprise.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We've checked everywhere.
There's nothing.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Place is clean, Ashburn.
Looks like your...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...theory has a few holes in it.
Let's roll, boys.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So you think it's clean, huh?
Oh, here we go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's what they said last year</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">right before I arrested
the Red Falls Killer.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are those?
Barbecued spare ribs?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Is that what that is?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know,
maybe I'm wrong. Or...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...maybe I'm not.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah. Airtight.
Dipped in wax.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I respect that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I especially like the meat
to distract the dog.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And while that may have fooled the
loudest breather in the world...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...it did not fool me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And unfortunately it's not
what I'm looking for.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So let's just cut to the chase.
Are there guns in the house?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know anything
about any guns.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Interesting.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe I'm wrong... you know?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wait for it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe these guys
are right for a change.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stranger things
have happened, right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- That's a trap.
- Meteors, comets...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Somebody married Pete and he
can't even count to three.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">See? Right there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, so frustrating.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know, they loved these houses
during the prohibition era.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You guys know what
prohibition is, don't you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, selling your ass
for money?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Really?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, it was alcohol.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">People loved to drink it, even
though they weren't supposed to.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And these houses
had all these nooks</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and crannies where they could hide it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Like this one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Is there something behind me?
There is, isn't there?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now you can roll.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Gentlemen.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nice work, dick.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's go!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hard to believe she's single.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Immediately below that,
you feel a little crease...</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wow, that's pretty impressive, huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do you see that?
Look at that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Make an incision
right through there.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's pretty amazing, huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Pretty amazing.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Pumpkin!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Here, kitty, kitty!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you at
the neighbor's again?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Pumpkin!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Here, kitty, kitty!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Go on home. I'll see you tomorrow.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There you go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Pumpkin, I told you to stay
away from that weird lady.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, boy. Wife doesn't like
you working late, huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What do you want?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, just letting you know that I
have been observing the agents.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Overseeing what
they've been up to,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">you know...
keeping an eye on them.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah. Supervising.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Supervising. Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look, Ashburn.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I haven't made
any decisions yet.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, of course not.
Everyone deserves a shot.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know if you are the
right person for this position.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm sorry, what?
I'm confused.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Walk with me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I've closed more cases than any agent here.
Should I not have done that?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You are a solid agent. There
are many other solid agents.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">None of them have closed
the Red Falls Killer case.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ashburn, it's no secret that none
of the other agents like you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I've gotten
countless complaints</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">of arrogance and competitiveness.
..showmanship.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just give it a rest.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right. We've got
a situation in Boston.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The Feds picked up chatter
on a guy moving in.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Simon Larkin.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We don't know what he looks like,
where he comes from, nothing.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We believe this guy is
doing the legwork for him.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Julian Vincent.
Nasty son of a bitch.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Murder. Extortion.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is his M.O.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The problem with
guys like that is...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...everyone's
too scared to talk.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Pack your bags.
I'm sending you to Boston.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know how to get
inside people's heads.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You want to find Larkin,
get to Julian.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You do well with this,
we can talk about the job.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Whoo!</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>She's got stickers
on her locker</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>And the boys' numbers there
in magic marker</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I'm hungry and
the hunger will linger</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I eat sixteen saltine crackers
then I lick my fingers</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Well, every morning
I deliver the news...</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, Rojas sent me over.
He said you were really nice.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, what you looking for?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What's your name?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Champaz. What's yours?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Champaz?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Did your mom
give you that name?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Not exactly.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Hey, Mullins. Captain
wants to know when you're coming in.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know what? Tell him I'll be there
sharply at go-fuck-yourself o'clock.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay? If there's no traffic.
Thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That seems kind of expensive.
Expensive?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Can you break a hundred?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I'm not gonna
break a hundred.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't think I have that.
Do you have a discount?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What's going on here?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, I don't want any drugs.
All right? Oh!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How you doing?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you trying to get a
deal on my girl here?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you her pimp?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, we're just friends.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, I think this is just
between her and I, so...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Am I invading your space here?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Kind of.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't want to do that. Let
me see if this'll help you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I just want to...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's a good thing I didn't
get the drugs from you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, can you imagine that?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That would have been crazy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That would have been bad.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That would have been bad!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Phew!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You'd better wipe that brow.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Listen, I gotta ask. Whatever... But
what was actually going on here?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We were just...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She looked kind of sad, so I thought I'd
help her out and give her a ride home.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's nice, like a good Samaritan.
Yeah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you depressed? Was he
giving you a ride home?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I was cheering you up.
Yeah, good for you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know who else is pretty sad?
Frank over here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right, Frank? You get sad 'cause
you shit and piss yourself?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You having a sad day, Frank?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, maybe you can put him
in the back of your car.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You want to shit and piss
all over this guy's car?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's open up the...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Frank, you wanna shit your pants and get in the...
Oh, Good, it's open.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can put Frank in there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He can shit and piss
himself until he's happy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got some towels...
Does that sound good?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why don't you let me
see your I.D.?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, come on, please?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let me take the whole thing.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't...
It's good, I got it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, good.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got nervous that
maybe you didn't have</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">a wife and a whole
bunch of kids, but...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...luckily you do.
What's your wife's name?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bella.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, Bella. Good.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, can I borrow your phone for a minute?
My battery's out.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why do you want
to borrow my phone?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Because I asked
you for your phone.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Give me your fucking phone.
Shut your mouth.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Can you give me one chance here?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I'll give you one chance.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, who's this? Is this Bella?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, no, no!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't do that. Don't do that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is Officer Mullins.
I'm here with your husband.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">God! What are you, Spock?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, he's not been in an
accident, unfortunately.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I do have him here
with a known prostitute.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She's lying!
Bella, she's lying!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, that's not
the first time, huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, that's him. He's crying because
I'm breaking his fucking hand.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, she said do it harder.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ow! All right, Bella.
That's for Bella.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You got to go with
your instincts, Bella.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're welcome.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She's probably gonna
burn your shit today.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You don't understand.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She just had a baby.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There's a lot going on down there.
I'm not gonna touch that!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why don't you take
your seatbelt off?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on, please.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You seem reasonable.
Take your fucking belt off.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You look like you
got some compassion.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I love the sound
of a guy that...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...after his wife gives him
his fifth fucking child,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">complains about
her messy vagina.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And then you don't want
to fucking touch her?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can unlock the door!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get out of the fucking car!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get out of the fucking car!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you kidding me?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get up against the car.
What is your problem?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You want to do that?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's hot! The car is hot!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Good! I hope it burns
your fucking dick off.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, it's Rojas!
My favorite asshole.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look what I found.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Did I take some of your business away?
That's a shame.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know what you're talking about.
I just stand on this corner...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...and do my sodukas, okay?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, is that right? First of
all, it's sudoku, dumb-ass.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And you want to tell me that
you're just here coincidentally?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right in the middle
of all the prostitutes?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Lady, why are you
so obsessed with me?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You should be ashamed,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">trying to break down a successful
black man. You racist?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't play that race
bullshit card with me!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nine out of ten guys
I fuck are black guys!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Lady, what you need to do is go down
the road, take a vacation, okay?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And go get your groove back.
Lady, just relax. Chill. Okay?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What is that?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Take off.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's what I thought.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm not a part of this!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shut up! Shut up!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, it's on.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She's crazy!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on, please let me out. I
get really carsick.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, no, that's terrible!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got him now.
I got him!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You are a meth head!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, look who's here!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, you better run!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got him! I got him!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You piece of shit, I said stop!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I said stop!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I said stop!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're crushing my balls!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I hope they fucking rupture!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Lady, get the fuck off me! What
the hell is wrong with you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bella, I'm sorry!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let me go! Hold still,
you piece of shit!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">My leg, lady! Let me go!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What is wrong with you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll tell you what's the matter with me!
It's you, piece of shit!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Son of a bitch!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stop moving!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Leave me alone!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get off me! Get off me!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shit. Oh!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What the hell did
you throw at me?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A watermelon.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A watermelon?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Aw, hell, no! See, I told
you you was a racist.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I tried to hit you with my car.
What's that make me?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's see what you got in...
Oh, look at this!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look at this.
Not even my birthday.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, you planted
that shit on me!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I planted it.
I'm innocent!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shut up before I feed you watermelon.
Get up!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Levy?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Federal Agent Sarah Ashburn
from the New York field office.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hi, how are you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I need all your files on all
known drug dealers of the area.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right. We heard
you were coming.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Actually, I was expecting it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll show you to your desk.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Not necessary.
I won't be here long.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can carry these.
Thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Whoa! Hey! Ashburn!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh!
Oh, God!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You okay?
What is it?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Low-end dealer just brought
into the East Boston precinct.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Name's Terrell Rojas.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh. Oh, okay.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Good. Thank you very much.
Good luck out there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's not about luck, pal.
Not about luck.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wow.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That was almost cool.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Almost.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on, come on.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ain't gonna fucking park today?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right.
Here we go. Finally.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm moving in there!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, don't...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, hey!
No, get back in your car!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, asshole!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Goddamn it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, you need to sign in.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Captain Woods?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Captain Woods?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Christ.
I'm sorry?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Uh... How can I help you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We got intel recently
that you brought in</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">a dealer by the name
of Terrell Rojas.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, but Detective Mullins
isn't back from lunch yet.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm sure he won't mind.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He's a she, and we're not
allowed to go near her collars.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let me tell you what I think.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Every second
we're standing here</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">is interfering with
the federal investigation.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So if you'd be so kind
as to show Mr. Rojas</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">to an interrogation room.
Thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Special Agent?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This way.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Special Agent.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Special Agent.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You are looking at
possession with intent...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...which is a class D drug charge,
chapter 94C, section 32A.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I had a joint and a few
little bags of coke.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Since when is
that shit illegal?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The answer to your
question is always.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And with your priors...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...you are looking at 25 years
and some pretty stiff fines.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who the hell cares about fines?
That's 25 years!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Never mind. Let's see
what you make of these.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What I make of them...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...is that somebody doesn't want
somebody else selling on their turf.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But you're still here... and you're alive.
Why is that?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who you working for?
Nobody.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who you working for?
Nobody.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who you working for?
Nobody!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If I tell you,
that's my ass chopped up</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">into a million
motherfucking pieces!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Goddamn it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fucker.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">God. Puss!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Motherfucker!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Everybody's got to fucking
park in my spot. Goddamn it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shit! Suit-wearing, god...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ow, fuck!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I said I'm fucking parking there!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Steal my goddamn fucking space!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't want you to do time.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't want you to get chopped
up into little, tiny...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...mother-F-ing pieces. Oh.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can protect you. I can.
But you've got to help me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can help you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You'll help me?
Yeah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where can I find Julian?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I get my stuff from this bitch
named Tatiana on Newkirk Avenue.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Can you describe her?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She got brown eyes.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She got some
big-ass breastses.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Big breastses.
Okay.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Can you maybe be a little
bit more specific?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Her breastses is like this.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay. Thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's a shame.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh! Ha-ha! Oh, yeah!
We're at a comedy party!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Move the fuck out of my way.
Get a room.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Tim, you still owe me $40.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, tomorrow it's $60!
Fucking dickweed.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why is the cage empty?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What did I tell you
about moving my prisoners?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He's in interrogation.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why would he be in interrogation
when I'm standing right here?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They came and got him.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who's "they"?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It better be two of me.
Is it two of me?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It was a lady.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm a lady.
Did I come and get him?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, it was a different lady.
She was nice.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm fucking nice.
Why was she nice to you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She made me give her the keys.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm gonna make you
fucking bend over...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...and I'm gonna reach up
your ass into your pocket</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and get the keys to your house.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Then I'm gonna drive there...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...come in your front door
and kill you in your sleep.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I think I have a clear idea
of what we're looking for,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and I appreciate your time.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wow, lady, you're on
a real fucking roll.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Excuse me?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I won't excuse you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I just spent the last 30 minutes
thinking of ways to kill you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm sorry, when did we meet?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Is this your lawyer?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you an insurance salesman?
Do you sell those shitty suits?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.
How can I help you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You can get all of that
and get the fuck out of here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is my room</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Were you about to be
questioned by a detective?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I am a detective
and that's my perp.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ah! I understand now.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Detective, Mr. Rojas will
be continuing on with me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No.
It's a jurisdictional issue.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Not gonna happen.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Your efforts are duly noted.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, great.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And if you're okay with
everything, could you just...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...close the door on the way out?
I'll shut the door on you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Will you lay down and put
your head in the door?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll slam it
about 157,000 times.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Aw, shit, girl, you better run.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shut your mouth.
Run like you on fire.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Be quiet.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get up and we'll
settle this outside.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I won't be going outside.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're gonna get up
and come outside.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, ma'am.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fine. We'll do this inside.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Can somebody remove this person
from the interrogation room?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of.
It runs in many families.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm gonna hit you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're not. Please don't.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm gonna hit you and knock
all your little buttons.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm gonna hit you there,
or here...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do not put your finger in...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stop touching my buttons!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stop wearing buttons.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't move those
fucking hands at me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll get that stupid barrette!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll take that barrette right
out of your fucking hair!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stop, stop, stop!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Both of you... my office now.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nope. Not in there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There is nothing I can do, Mullins.
The FBI has jurisdiction.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe they're in here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stop. Will you stop?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nope, they're not in there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What is she doing?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She's looking for my balls.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, if anyone sees
the Captain's balls...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...let me know. They're about
this big, but a lot tinier.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They're like a pea... or
like a ball bearing.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Or if you've ever seen a mouse
ball, about half that size.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Incredibly tiny. They're
like really, really tiny...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...little girl balls.
If little girls had balls.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So if you find little,
tiny girl balls...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...that are so fucking
tiny and shriveled up...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...let me know, because I'll put
them right back up his scrotum!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Knock it off.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How about you do
something for once?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What do you want me to do?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Have my back</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and stop being so goddamn
disappointing like everybody else!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, that was professional.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Was that not professional?
Here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let me be professional. Let
me help you pick up your bag.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's very mature.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let me just
straighten that shit up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, wait, hey!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Good news! Good news,
I found his balls!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">In a clear sack! Yeah, enjoy that.
Shove those back up there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Cop of the year!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Keep it up!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This job is destroying me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know how old I am?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">58?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm 43 years old.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, I always round up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I have a five-year-old son
who calls me grandpa!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So, uh... anyhoo, sir...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...if you could
just... you know...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...keep her... away from me...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...that would
be... very helpful.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She stole your keys,
didn't she?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yes, she did. Do you know
where I can find her?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She's probably at O'Flanagan's.
It's a bar down the street.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's a little divey. You
might want to wear a vest.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Okay I'm Rambo I ramshack</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I'm next to that cheese
like rat traps</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>On top of that green
like grass ass</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>That's over y'all head
like snapbacks</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I get it where I fit in,
put up then I put in</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Tryna find an ass
I can put my fucking foot in</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Run this shit,
no, I run this shit</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Don't give one fuck, bitch
I done this shit...</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sir, is this place open?
Is there a door... Oh.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So there is. Could you point
it out to me with your finger?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Thank you.
Thank you very much.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hand them over.
Give me the keys. Now.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Did you drop something?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I apologize.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You are so concerned about
taking down a guy like Rojas...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...wasting all this time</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">when I could have stopped a drug
lord who is far more dangerous...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...and supplies to
people like Rojas.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bullshit. Who?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, you want to
see some bull feces?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I think I said "bullshit".</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Here's some bull poo-poo.
How does that look?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">See that? Oh, come on.
I got a kid here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, I'm so sorry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm very, very sorry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wait a minute, this is a bar.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, absolutely not.
No, no, no, no.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why do I not know
who Simon Larkin is?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That would probably be because
the FBI knows more than you do.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Anything happening in my
neighborhood I have a right to know.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, you actually don't.
You want to know.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And you do not
have the clearance</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">that would allow you to read
everything that is in this file.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, all right!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">When bad shit happens
in my neighborhood,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I get a little
passionate about it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I shouldn't have read your files.
I went too far.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, I accept your apology.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But you need to understand that
this is a highly important case.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And the information is
highly, highly sensitive.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Therefore we have
these clearances.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't have the clearances.
Right? I mean, you are...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You are, wow, FBI.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I mean, you are a goddamn
angel of the law.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, that's a little...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I want you to spread those
wings and just soar.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Watch it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You watch it.
I'm a federal agent.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, yeah? Well, guess what, you dick!
I'm a federal agent, too!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I work at the post office.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, I appreciate the work you do
for us on the ground. Thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You bet your ass you do.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I see no one will be
getting their mail today!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Good burn.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Good burn. You got burned,
you big drunk paddy!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Kiss my cunt, you twat!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So we are good?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Thank you.
Thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">America thanks you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And I it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And it you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Whoa!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yes, okay.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Good day.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dumbass.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>So how you been, Jason?</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You want to talk
about Simon Larkin?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I never heard of him.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't lie to me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're my brother,
I know when you're lying.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm just a low-level guy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I heard of Larkin
but I never met him.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He's a goddamn animal, and I'm
trying to keep him from meeting you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You gonna storm through Boston
and take down a drug lord?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I might.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Have you met me?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, unfortunately.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, shut up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look, I get out tomorrow.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm coming home.
I'm gonna be fine.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I promise, all right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh! Never approach me if
I'm not expecting you!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you, an animal?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You said you would
stay off my case,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and now I find you in front
of Tatiana's apartment.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I live here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, that's hilarious.
You know what's not funny?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That you stole a
confidential FBI case file.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't remember any of that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm going to say it one more time.
Stand down, Officer.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck off, Officer.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, okay, now you've really done it.
I'm going to call my boss.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, you do that, tattle tits!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fucking narc!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Unbelievable. Unbelievable.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>It's Ashburn, sir.
I need authorization...</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...to suspend a police officer
from my investigation.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ashburn, why is working with local
authorities a problem for you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Sir, it's not.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I understand how this might
sound coming from me...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...but I think this individual might
actually be mentally unstable.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Her captain says she
grew up on those streets</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and knows them
better than anyone.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That seems like an asset
to our investigation.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sir, I...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, just work with her.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Show me you can do this
or forget the promotion.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, sir, no need to take someone's badge.
I think I can, uh...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I think I can work
something out, sir.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right. Thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know, uh...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I just...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I think you and I got off
on the wrong foot.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know Boston,
and you obviously have...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...a lot of resources and a lot of
knowledge about the area that could be,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">you know, useful.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Probably very.
So, uh...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...maybe we can work
together on this.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't need your help
to take down Larkin.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You wouldn't even have known
about Larkin if not for me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So obviously the FBI can
get information you can't.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And there's a lot more
where that comes from. A lot!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe I just need to hear a little
"I need your help, Mullins."</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I won't be doing that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, then get your
ass back in your car.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is ridiculous.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm an FBI agent.
You're a police officer.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"I need your help, Mullins."</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I need your help, Mullins.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What is this, a whisper party? I
want that third floor to hear it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"I need your help, Mullins." Then
give me a little echo on "Mullins".</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I need your help, Mullins,
Mullins, Mullins...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just move. Move, move!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">God! Even in that,
you're annoying.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I will work with you...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...as long as we're clear
that this is my case.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's actually
not... correct.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Awesome.
Glad you see it my way.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Careful of the car.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Goddamn it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stand down.
I got it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If you just let go...
I got it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I have it, just let me...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I've got it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shit!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ma'am, you, uh...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just go. Just go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let me take the lead on this.
I'm a trained interviewer.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"Interviewer?" What are
you, Barbara Walters?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I thought we'd go in there and
bring in some heat on her.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm sorry, what does
that even mean?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Me and you, we're the heat.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We go in there, interrogate her,
scare the shit out of her...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We don't say "interrogation".
It's too aggressive.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Rule number one, catch more
with sugar than with a stick.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's a horrible
fucking saying.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We like to create a genuine
personal interest in the subject,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">allowing them to open up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Then I'll perform instant
personality assessments</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">based on
the Myers-Briggs theory...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...Thematic
Apperception Tests and...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...a few others I
won't bore you with.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, I am balls deep
in boredom.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, as long as
you don't do that</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">whole long explanation again...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...we'll try it
your way first.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Only because you're older.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Tatiana Krumova, I am Special
Agent Sarah Ashburn...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...and this is Detective Mullins.
Detective Mullins.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And we'd like to ask you a few questions
if you could give us a moment.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shoot. You know, now is bad.
I'm making butter.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How about other time?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If you could just give... How
about right fucking now?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right fucking now!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, Tatiana, thank you.
This is very kind of you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How long have you lived here?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I've lived here
since I moved in.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, that's
very... very helpful.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, we'll get
a little more specific.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What do you do for a living?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I know what this asshole
does for a living.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What you know, asshole?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sugar, no stick.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It is Bulgarian, is it not?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I'm fucking French!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, Jesus.
Tatiana...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't understand
what you are saying.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nice bullshit Bulgarian.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That was perfect Bulgarian.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I mean I don't understand
what you are talking about!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why I go to jail
when I don't do shits?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ah! So she did understand what I
was saying, just not the context.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, sweet God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, Rosetta Stone,
you're done.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ugh! Oh, Jesus.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How many porns have been
made on this couch?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, this couch not of your satisfaction?
You're not comfy?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll get comfy. When
my foot's up your ass.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wow.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That'll make me really comfy.
Don't poke me!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Tatiana, I want to
get really real.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You ready to get real?
Let's get real.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, we both know you've been
blowing shit up your nose all day.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Man, I get it. There's nothing
more I'd love to do than...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...slip into my camisole, put my
feet up, have a little smack.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Real good time,
maybe a couple cold ones,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">a little chip and dip,
watch some cartoons.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'd get a big bowl of coke...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'd put my face in it, cut
it with a little Ritalin...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Heaven on fucking earth, right?
Sure.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'd camp out all week
for tickets to that show.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What is this, <i>Training Day?</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All fucking week
I'd camp out for that!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But you, you piece of shit, you've
been rolling deep for a long time.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And now it's time you open
up that goddamn mouth</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and tell us what
we want to know.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You got good point. I tell you what.
I open my mouth.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You get the fuck
out my house now!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How's that for open mouth?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck out! Get fuck out!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I'll get the fuck out.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You should really stop smoking
because it's an awfully bad habit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're leaving half your
lipstick in the ashtray.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I had a great aunt that lost
most of her teeth to smoking.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Good to know.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A lot of fistfights,
too, but mostly smoking.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're gonna get
out of your hair.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That is not front door.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Put your hands
where I can see 'em!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't fucking move.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Is this your drug mule?
Oh, my gosh!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's my mother!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do you have balloons
of horse up your ass?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You break my fucking door!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stand down, Officer.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who closes the door
to take a shit?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Humans do.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't touch underpants!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get out, bull in china shop!
Out of my house!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What the fuck's wrong with you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wow, you are just
all stick and no sugar.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Did you get
the cigarette or not?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Uh, yeah... of course I did.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I snagged these matches, too. I think
our guy likes to go to Club Ekko.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Really?
Yes, really.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's find out, shall we?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hang on. The couch was disgusting.
I need to wash my hands.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wait a minute,
you do live here?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's what I said.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wow, your windows
are all boarded up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I've got the glass,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I just don't have the...
you know, window blankets.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The curtains?
You mean the curtains?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Whatever. Okay?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's just my family.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, it's sweet.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You want something to eat?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I didn't finish my submarine
sandwich the other day.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sorry I don't have poached
eggs in rubies for you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I don't mean
to be rude, but...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...one could catch a MRSA
infection in here, that's all.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What part of that wasn't rude?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just for your own well-being.
For example, that door.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That door has no
way of locking.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Someone could barge in at any moment.
It's not safe.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No one's coming in here...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...because they know
I keep this fully stocked.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I know.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A Marlin 1894CB?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Is that an FN PS90?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah! Nice one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You have all of this
in your house?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You didn't even
mention my baby.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look at this.
Oh!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">My little pride and joy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This little beauty could
vaporize an above-ground pool.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If you didn't want
the pool anymore.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No kidding.
Pretty, huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah. How do you refuse
that sales pitch, huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You don't.
Unless you're an asshole.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I haven't seen one of these
since World War II.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No! God,
that... occasionally ticks.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Put it back slowly.
Slowly!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Like half that speed.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Half that speed!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stop shaking.
Put your pinky down.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got it on eBay. It was supposed
to be bigger and different.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It doesn't matter.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm gonna "Bad Feedback"
his ass, though.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, ladies.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Here's the DNA results
from the book of matches</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and the cigarette butt
you got from Tatiana's.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We pulled two sets of prints.
First one's a real nut job.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look at this. Reckless
driving, assault, arson.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God.
Ahem! Really?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who the fuck is this guy?
He's my assistant.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know I'm an agent, right?
Arson?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It was a drug house!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I really feel the need
to finish reading your files.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I feel the need for you to
stay out of my business</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">so I don't punch
you in the teeth.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What did you find out
about the cigarette?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay. Hank LeSoire.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Local businessman.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Got tons of ties to the
drug world, black market...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...as well as prostitution rings.
Co-owner of Club Ekko.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It looks like we found our distributor.
Can you back that up, please?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Back up to which one?
That.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm not into you!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Your breast is
invading my space.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Keep your finger
out of my areola.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Contain your areola!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There. Now we're even.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He looks like a real Chatty Cathy.
Did you tap the phone?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I haven't been able to. Guy
gets a new prepaid every other week.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">By the time I can
get his phone number</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and hack in,
he's got a new one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's get a bug into the
phone he does have.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I want to know what
he's saying this week.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just get a court order and a bug.
We'll do it ourselves.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If you're gonna boss me around,
at least buy me dinner first.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No.
Okay. Cool.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll get that to you ASAP.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You got to work on your game.
That was weak.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What? I thought I
was being charming.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know what to say to that.
Now I just feel bad for you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, so LeSoire
co-owns Club Ekko.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's start surveilling it and figure
out how to get a bug in his phone.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Tell me everything
you know about it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's just
a shitty club downtown.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I've never been inside,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">but there's always a line of
awful people around the corner.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They've called P.D. a couple
times to break up fights.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shit.
What's wrong?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just don't look. Don't look!
Act like we're talking.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, Shannon.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, Robin.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I really enjoyed our night together.
You just disappeared on me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I know.
I was there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Can I take you to dinner,
or a movie, or something?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do you not hear how pathetic
everything out of your mouth sounds?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There's a girl out there
for you, but it's not me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe it's her. Her lady business
is like an old dirty attic.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's full of broken Christmas
lights and doll shoes and shit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why don't you
clean that out for her?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's a
misrepresentation of my vagina.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wow, what was that about?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You sleep with a guy one time and he
wants to marry you. Jesus Christ!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I know what you mean.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who was that?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">My mom.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Ortiz
settles in the batter's box.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Verlander with the pitch.
A ground ball...</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>...through the legs of Cabrera
into right field.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Pedroia is headed for second base.
He slides, and he is...</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How about I tell you</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">a little something
about myself?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God.
Let's see...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I went to undergrad at Yale.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I have been with the Bureau
for about twelve years.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Up for a promotion.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">See, I caught
the Red Falls Killer.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I remember thinking
that guy was innocent.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He's been in jail for eleven months.
That would make me...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...a horrible person if what
you said was actually factual.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, you can just tell
the judge you fucked up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I didn't. I did not F up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't get your
panties in a wad.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They're not wadded.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm intuitive. I say what I feel.
I'm usually right.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Take it or leave it.
Oh, I did not know.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There's our guy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I see him as well.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Well, Daft Punk
is playing at my house</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>My house</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I'll show you the ropes, kid,
show you the ropes</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I got a bus and a
trailer at my house</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>My house...</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There he is. Over there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We got to get past
those bodyguards.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We won't have to,
because he'll come to us.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Excuse me!
Step aside, please!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This will go fast.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">When I pull the alarm, the crowd
will head towards the two exits.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He will head toward
the nearest one,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">which is northeast.
I will bump into him.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I will grab the cell, place the bug
in it, tell him he dropped the phone.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's something I like
to call a "cop drop".</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I got it.
Okay... here we go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">My God, there are no wires
attached to this thing.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What is that? Gum?
Or is it Silly Putty?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't touch it!
It's a condom.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, he's on the move.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We got to get out there and shake our
asses like the rest of the foxes.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, yes, dancing to get close to him.
Fantastic idea!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Jesus. Don't!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't do anything you're doing.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But he's over that way.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's just go find a bathroom.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I told you, I don't have
to use the bathroom!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Did I ask about your bathroom habits?
You are killing us out there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You don't fit in! Take
off that fucking jacket.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is a good jacket.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You look like you're
gonna set up a table</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and do their taxes.
Take it off!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is ridiculous.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Your shitty jacket?
My God!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, jacket's off.
Jacket's off.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can't watch whatever
process is about to happen.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now unbutton your buttons.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm a federal agent!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I know, and you look like one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You think you'll bump into him and
he won't think something's up?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fine. How's that? Is that good?
Can we go?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I think it's getting worse.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">My fear is I'm gonna
put you in a bikini</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and you'll still look like
a fucking bank teller.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do you have to
use that language?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm trying to make a point!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm saying your face</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and whatever is underneath this</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">shitty outfit is
maybe not terrible.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll have you know I
dress appropriately.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got it!
It's when this...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...your big flapping mouth, starts
running, and then you put...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...this getup on top of it, and it's just...
it's a boner killer.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm gonna help you.
What are you doing?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now I just want you to shut up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God! I only brought
five of these to Boston!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll cut the other four.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">God, that's terrible fabric!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just get that off your wrist.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This one was of
my favorite ones.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just take it off.
Take it off!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, just give me a second!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, I look like
I've been attacked.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's not my fault.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, it's my fault? Let
me even out the bottom.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Would you stop
carving up my clothes?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm making shorts!
Everybody likes shorts.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Jesus! Hold still!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That feels... awkward. Weird.
Don't touch that area.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't duck down, or you're
gonna suck my hand up there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Will you stop
pulling my pants off?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Jesus!
What?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are those?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are those?
Stop it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They're my Spanx. They
hold everything together.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why? What's gonna
come popping out?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nothing! It just keeps everything
where it's supposed to be.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shit, like medically?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, not medically.
Just to...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It just keeps it right
where it's supposed to be.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You got to vent that furnace.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's a lot of
compression and heat.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It gets plenty of
ventilation, thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">My hand's a foot off
and it's on fire.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Then why don't you
cut them shorter</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">because no one can
see my cervix yet?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll cut them shorter. No, stop it!
We're finished.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, let's do you now.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't need that!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What do you mean?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I put my sexuality
out through motion.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">When this starts going, it's all...
You'll get it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So I have to look like this and
you get to look like that?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I know, it's not fair.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We gotta tackle the helmet.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's got a real style
memory, huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You gotta flip that shit over.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bend over.
Why?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You look like Darth Vader.
Just flip it over.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">God Almighty.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I gotta just finger tease
the shit out of this.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wait. What?
I'm gonna finger tease it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What is that?
What does that mean?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Not what you want it to mean.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hit it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you looking at?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I like how your friend's shorts
make me feel in my shorts.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I am sorry. That was much
cruder than I meant it to be.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I stand corrected on the shorts.
Let's proceed.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God, we're dead.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">At one o'clock.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's do this.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get in there.
Get in there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How do you get in?
I don't know how.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Back it in.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get in there. Get your hands
in and get the phone.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, Pinky.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do the cop drop.
I'm trying to!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do the fucking cop drop!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can't do it
from this position!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No. No, no, no!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, coming in one more time.
Get her away.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got her! But
you're like a fucking nanny!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Picture time!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Damn it. Can somebody
get my phone?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got it!
I got it! Let go!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Thanks a lot, bro. And close
a couple buttons... club policy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">God bless!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got the orange one!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I need some water.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stop it! Stop it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I will fucking kill you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where is he?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get in there.
Okay, one more time.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get her away.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Jesus,
there's too many of them!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Hello.
- Hi.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Your moves are weird
as shit... and I love it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You have really soft hair.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, yeah,
it's the shampoo move!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Use your boobs!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You see these?
Oh, God, yeah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm looking, I'm liking.
Oh, girl, so great!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, what is this?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What's going on? Whoa!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God, back it in.
Whoa, please!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hi.
Hi.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're the first chick over
forty to give me a boner.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Great.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Want to go get a drink?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay. Yeah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe. Maybe.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's the only reason
girls hit on me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, sorry, yeah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Every night, the hottest
chicks come in here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They're like, "There's LeSoire!"
Short skirts, too much makeup.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Looking like fucking gremlins.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, I hate that!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't feed them after midnight, right?
They turn into more sluts.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Give me a whiskey.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I just noticed that lion.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That is amazing.
Fuck!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who the fuck keeps putting
lions in the back?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fourteen dollars.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fourteen dollars?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Is it magic fucking whiskey?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do I get a motorcycle with it?
Is it served in Jesus's shoe?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Can I sit in your lap?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Obviously.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I like where this is going.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Me, too.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I would love to!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're having
a big foam party later.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So sorry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I am so sorry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Drunk bitch.
Get her out of here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She holds her
liquor like a five-year-old.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm so sorry!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- All right, sweetheart, you're out.
- Sorry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- I'm a pony!
- Sorry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get her the fuck out!
Take her home.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I've got to drive the school bus tomorrow!
It's my shift.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- It's my shift!
- Here we go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I didn't get your number!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll find you. I'll find you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh! Pretty nice, right?
Ooh!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I have to say that
was pretty awesome.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It really was. Put her there.
Put her there!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, put her there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ah!
Don't do that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You just make it odd.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm trying not to
lash out at you,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and you make it
really impossible.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What was that about?
We got company.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hold on, I can lose them.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You want me to take the wheel?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I was a precision
driver at Quantico.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They thought I was the instructor...
I was that good.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shoot.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Lose them!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What do you think
I'm trying to do?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stop it! Stop it!
I got it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hold on.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ah!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And that is how
you lose a tail.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nicely done.
I'm surprised.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Our friends are back.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got it. I got it.
Tag out.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you doing?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll show you
how I stop a tail.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Watch out!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">FBI! Drop your weapon!
Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Special Agent Garrett, DEA!
Drop it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, seriously,
what the fuck are you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you, fucking deaf?
I just told you, DEA!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Drop your fucking gun!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm very sorry about earlier.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I just thought you
were an assassin.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Because of your... weapon.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And because you
look evil as shit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I get it. I'm an albino,
so I look like a bad guy, right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, that's not what we were...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah. Yeah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, well, I'm DEA! And
let me tell you something.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Two months we've been
sitting on that club,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">then you two
come in one night...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...like a couple of amateurs and
almost blow the whole thing!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Obviously you have no idea
who you are speaking with.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm Federal Agent
Sarah Ashburn.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yes, I'm sure your credentials
are quite impressive,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">as is your choice
of... wardrobe.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nice hot pants.
You might want to try</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">shaving above
the knee next time.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you giving beauty tips?
Do you own a fucking mirror?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Listen. This whole "female
professionals in the workplace" thing,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm fine with it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But the problem, all due
respect with you people...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...is that you get all excited,
your emotions take over...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...your hormones kick in, you're
riding the cotton pony...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Next thing you know
you're complimenting</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">the bad guy on
his fucking couch!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, all due respect to you,
who's your wife?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A five-pound bag of flour
with a hole in it?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, hey, hey!
Listen, ma'ams.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We've been cramped inside
this van for two months.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're not gonna
let you swoop in</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">from nowhere and
take all the credit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't want to see you two
anywhere near this case!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We have got
informants everywhere!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We've got
surveillance everywhere!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We do not need
the two of you...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...coming in with your estrogen
flying at full speed...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...sticking out in the middle of broad
daylight fucking things up for us!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Because the two of us are
gonna bring these guys in.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck you, chalk balls!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Not even on your birthday,
sweetheart.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's right, keep walking.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This isn't over.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">FYI, we women were born
with hair on our legs.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You don't have to stop.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you doing? Whoa!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You want to tell me
what was wrong back there?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nothing.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I saw your face when
you watched the footage.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It looked like you saw someone you knew.
Possibly your brother?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You did not read that
from my fucking face.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You read my file, didn't you?
God, you're an asshole!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yes, I read it,
but it is my job</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">to know everything
about a case,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">including who I work with.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't like that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We should talk to him tomorrow.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where is he?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Probably at my parents'.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well then... let's
go to your parents'.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I can't go to my parents'.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm the one that
put him in jail.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, never mind.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's not like I liked doing it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He got mixed up with a lot
of really bad people.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And then he started...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He started using that shit. I
just had to get him out of there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know, ironically, a lot
of people become addicted...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...when they're in prison.
I think it's like...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...80%-85% of the inmates
require treatments.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I hate you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But I actually wasn't finished.
I was going to say...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why can't you just be quiet?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What the F?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">These are cloth.
They're nice.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I could have shot you!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, I'm sorry, do you not like
someone invading your privacy?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, come on. I glanced at your file.
You broke into my home!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I care about who
I'm working with, too.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And it's a little uncomfortable</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">that you feel the need
to travel with trophies.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's not what you think.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They moved me up here,
rented this apartment,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and that is all my stuff.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">These four shitty, sad boxes... this is it?
This is your life?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God. I don't think that
could be any sadder if you...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...threw it all
in the trash bag</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and started
dragging it behind you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You use coffee filters for
toilet paper at your house.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm buying them anyway.
They have a dual purpose.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's not what they're for.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, real fancy-pants.
I see it. I see it in here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Looks like you were pretty
cool in high school, huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yes. Yes, I was.
But what...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Because you weren't.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know what that girl's not?
That girl's not cool.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">My favorite part is you
only have two signatures...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...both by teachers.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Mrs. Burke said, "Have a good
summer." That's a personal touch.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">My real favorite is this one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"It'll get better."</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yes, fine.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, now we're even.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I see you have a cat.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yep.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Is he around? Because I'd like
to, you know, pet him and stuff.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He... ran away, uh,
when I was in New York.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God, that
kind of tears me up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, it was,
um... it was a loss.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That cat got one look
at your shitty life</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and said,
"No fucking thanks, man..."</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"...I am outta here!"</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm still kind of just grieving
a little bit about it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That fucking tabby is an
asshole, that's what he is.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck you!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, "Fuck you!" That's what I
say to that cat. Goddamn it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Such a shitty,
shitty little life.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You can't even keep a cat.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That hurts a little bit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's just the grief.
No, not the grief.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's just the pounding
a little bit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh. All right.
Don't be a dick about it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Thank you for that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, let's
hit the road, okay?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I've got to change.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What's the matter
with your pantsuit?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's pajamas.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, excuse
the shit out of me,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I didn't realize you
slept in a fucking tux.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Go ahead, get your top hat.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is the place where
you're supposed to be civilized!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Be a mother
for once in your life.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, great. This asshole!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just take it easy.
Hey, Pop.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, pork chop.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, well, well.
Look who it is!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The rat's back in the house. Did you
come back to arrest somebody else?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know, I saw Ma throw a can of Diet
Coke in the garbage the other day.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She didn't recycle it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dad here, he's splicing cable
off the neighbors next door.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on now, Mark.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe you should
fingerprint him.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe get yourself
some stripes!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Petey here, how many songs</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">you download illegally
off the Internet? 5,000?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Ten, twenty thousand.
- 20,000!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Mikey just stole
a laptop from his work!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stole? I fucking worked there for six weeks.
I deserved to take it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Exactly. No health insurance.
That balances out.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But not you... you'll probably
call in the SWAT team!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Actually, she could, because
those are horrible examples.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Here are the nuggies!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Here we go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What kind of an animal throws
her own brother in jail?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This kind of animal... right here!
Shut up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How about keeps him
from killing himself?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I was the only one that
got him off the street.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">None of you fucks did!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You should never
arrest your family!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who the fuck are you?
That's Gina!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, tell Gina I'm gonna
strangle her at the table!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She is my best friend! You touch
her, you gotta go through me first.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who the fuck are you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll kill you, and kill her
with your fucking dead body!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Everybody calm down.
Shannon's right.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This one has no business
chiming in on a family matter!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"This one?" Why are you talking
about my girlfriend like that?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She wears sweatpants
to your mother's dinner!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Those are her
classy sweatpants.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They don't say
"Insert Here" on the ass.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Her ass is hanging out!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look at her breasts
at the table!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Welcome home.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You here to arrest me?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I hope not.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You selling Bibles?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, she's Ashburn.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We need to talk.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sit down.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Uh, that is one
of the better...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...Jesus sports-themed
paintings I've seen.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's very good. Nice.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you doing
at Club Ekko?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you, my mother?
How do you know I was there?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I know everything. Are you already
working for those guys again?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, this guy Julian,
he sent for me</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">because he wants me
to start working with him.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But I told him no, I'm getting
a straight job, and it's fine.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Everybody's cool now.
We parted amicably.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you a knock?
I'm sorry?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you a knock?
A "knock"?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm sorry, I don't
know what that is.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A knock.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Am I speaking fucking Japanese?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, listen to him.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll sound it out for you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...or are you not...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...a knock?
A fucking knock!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Like Johnny Depp
in <i>21 Jump Street.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ah, I see! Okay, a narc.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A knock, yes!
What was I saying?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I was missing the R.I heard
"knock", but apparently there's a C.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He said knock!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I said fucking knock, right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why are you wearing a long-sleeved flannel?
It's hot out.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm a little fluey.
It's nothing.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You want me to break that thumb?
Please, don't! No!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Mercy. Mercy. Mercy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Straighten that arm.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It looks worse than it is. It's not a big deal.
This guy Julian...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...wants me to keep working.
They like me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Tell me where I can
find Julian right now.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No. Just stay out of it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They're maniacs. They'll chop you
up, or gun you down, or worse.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Jason, tell me
what you fucking know!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know anything.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay. Sal Natale.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay?
You know Sal Natale?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Of course I do.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He was gonna steal
this huge shipment</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">they got coming in,
so they popped him.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He's in the trunk of his Caddy
under the Charles River Bridge.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I want you to stay
in this house.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If I catch you outside, I'll
hurt you worse than them.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you?
Why are you here?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm a federal agent.
I'm a Special Agent.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Special, like retarded?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We don't use that word.
We say "special needs".</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But I have a very high IQ.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you a boy or a girl?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's a fair question.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Uh, I'm... I'm female.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No kidding.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All woman!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">From the get-go?
No operation?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Um...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">From birth, yes.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How you get that close a shave
on your face?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I need to go, but I'll be back to, um...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nice knowing you.
Yeah, thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yep, that's
Sal Natale, all right.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bullet hole through the head. That's
unusually civilized for them.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, they cut out his tongue, too.
Ah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There you have it. They
like to send a message.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Did you find the tongue? Sure.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shoved it up his anal cavity.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's a weird message.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The tip of the tongue was
sticking out of the rectum.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So it made it appear
as if his buttocks</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">were giving the police
the raspberry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Did they draw googly eyes or
anything on his butt cheeks?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Seems like kind of an opportunity missed.
That would have been funny.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, I feel that they were just
trying to be tongue in cheek.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">God, don't do that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where are his belongings?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Any clues as to where
the body was killed?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're still looking
for their base camp.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, if there's
anything on him</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">that will tell us,
I will find it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Huh.
- Is that coke?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't think so.
It's more like a coating.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Same traces found
on all the victims' shoes.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All of them had...
Epoxy powder coating.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's right.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Each sample was made of the same ingredient.
Which means...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They were all
killed same place.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Exactly.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I checked it out Wow.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There are three places that
have this kind of powder.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Paint factory!
Yeah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We all know that.
Well, it's...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look at this.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This one right here is
centered in the location...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where all four dead
bodies were found!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right.
That's what I thought.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This one shut down years ago,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">owned by a man by
the name of Lief Sa...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sambertineson?
Sagglemint?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Samber...?
Old Sagglemint.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Santino.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, Santino!
Santino... Santino.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Is that a derivative
of Sagglemint?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get me the address
to that paint factory ASAP.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Excuse me, Ashburn? Um...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I was wondering...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh. This
is a little awkward.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Uh, it's nothing personal, but
as a rule I make it a point...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...not to date my
co-workers, so... thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I was wondering if you would
not talk to me in that tone.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh! Yes, of course!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's a little different.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I wouldn't.
Why would I?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why would you? Really.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We should go to
the paint factory.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are we clear here? Because
it got real awkward.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No... I think we're all good.
Right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Uh... ASHBURN: We're really good.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Same page.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Because I don't want any bad...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're all good.
Here we go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's go to the paint factory.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She doesn't want to date
co-workers, so spread the word.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shut up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Caught my man cheating Now I'm
rolling through the west side</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>'Bout to burn this fucking
house down like I'm Left Eye</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Rest in peace</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Like I'm Left Eye Rest in peace</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Like I'm Left Eye</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>'Bout to burn this motherfucker
down like I'm Left Eye</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Heard my man is cheating with
another bitch at my house</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What is that shit?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stop it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just cover me and go right.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, then say that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You make me want to shoot you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know what your
problem is, but we told you...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">stay out of the city.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know what it is. Are you deaf?
Do you not speak English?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got to do something
with you, man.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look, Julian...
I'm sorry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll sell for you guys.
Whatever you want me to do.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm just trying to
make some extra money.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You can't blame
me for that, right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Relax.
I totally get it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Thank you. I'm not
gonna shoot you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay. It's cool, man. Thanks.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He is.
Wait! Hold on!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shit!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If we grab Julian,
I can get into his head.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We'll have Larkin by tonight.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Two against two.
I like those odds.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll call for backup.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's already here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, hey!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I was looking for you. Um, I
forgot to get your number.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Cool. It's, uh,
1-800-GiveMeYourFuckingGuns.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's, uh...
too many numbers.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I met these disasters at
the club the other night.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now they're both here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You think you
might have been bugged?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Give me a break.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What the fuck?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Think you're hot shit?
Guess what.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You guys look even
older in this lighting!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on.
Fuck you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck you! It's not fuck me.
It's fuck you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know why? Because I'm
about to fuck you up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Pick it up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do it. Give me a reason
to shoot you in the face.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How long will this take?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe 12 hours, hopefully less.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I have to find out
what drives him.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We could just beat him
with a phonebook.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No! For so many
reasons, no.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You just need to be
patient, all right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It is crucial that
you remain patient.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's also crucial that you stop
wearing this stupid barrette.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't! Just leave it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why? You have one on your head.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, on top of my head,
like a normal person.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What is the difference?
Just move on.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If you enter that room, you could
break the bond we have created.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay? Just please, please
trust me on this one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do you understand
how important this is?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I do.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And you will be patient?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I will.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay. All right.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hello.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Coffee?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I drink a little more coffee
than I probably should.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where's Larkin?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You couldn't wait ten seconds?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What's so funny?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You... thinking you're
going to make me talk.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're talking
right now, dumb-ass!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You look like one of
the Campbell's soup kids</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">who grew up and
became an alcoholic.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, surprisingly catty.
You're a fucking genius.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I asked you to stay outside!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I need to go tough on him.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you not already doing that?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No! I'm doing
good cop, bad cop.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know, I can hear you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shut up!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just please,
don't do anything crazy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I won't do anything crazy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What am I gonna do that's crazy?
I'm a police officer. Huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Am I gonna
shoot you in the dick?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You said nothing crazy,
and that is a no-no!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No-no!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Turn around. I need you
to pass a polygraph.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Put it away!
Turn around!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't worry, she won't do it.
She won't do anything.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So you want to gamble with your
scrotum and your testicles?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, gamble away!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just go to the corner!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm in it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll tell you what we're gonna do...
play a little game.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm gonna take
out these bullets.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Except this one. Because
this is my favorite.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm gonna keep that in there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And then you're gonna
tell me where Larkin is.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And you're gonna
tell me when and where</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">that shipment is coming in.
Okay?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right now.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm gonna kill you
and everyone you know.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's not what I asked.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Straight arrow,
take the gun from her!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now you want me to
save your scrotum?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">When is the shipment coming in?
I don't know.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ah!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right! There's a
shipment on Wednesday!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where?
I don't know!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I swear to God, I don't know!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Tell her! Just tell
her where it is!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't shoot me in the dick!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know! It's gonna be Wednesday!
That's four shots!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't take any more shots!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just tell her
where it's coming in!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know! Don't
shoot me in the dick!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Enough! Stop it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You brought
Julian and LeSoire in?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You out of your minds?
Wasn't too smart.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh. So you're not supposed
to arrest someone</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">when they commit murder
and try and kill you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You wanted us to
keep them on the street?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You shouldn't
even have been there!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Larkin is the big catch,
not those two!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now we're never
gonna be able to...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Craig! Calm down!
We can all hear you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, dogs can hear you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Of course dogs can hear me!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you okay? Because
you look really pale.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's a genetic condition!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ashburn, come here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fucking snow cone.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, I get it! That's a good
one because I'm really white!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Can I have a moment
with my agent, please?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm good.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right. I'm gonna
be right over there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why didn't you alert anyone</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">once you found evidence
of Julian's whereabouts?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It was an unconfirmed lead.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I wasn't gonna waste anyone's
time until I knew it was real.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Give it a rest. I want
you to stand down...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...while I figure out how to
repair all this shit with the DEA.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sir, no, please.
I swear I've been doing</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">everything you sent
me out here to do.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We've been doing
such good work.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I know you are.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's just...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know, it's... never
easy when you are involved.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck that guy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If you're not in trouble,
you're not doing your job.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We should go get a drink. Right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What's the point of being a cop</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">if you can't get one drink
at the end of the night?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's what I'm talking about!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I said I just want one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, no, no, here...
it is one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sometimes he just likes
to do this thing where...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...he pours them in three
little glasses, but it's one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, here we go!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's loosen that up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okey-dokey.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There you go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- There you go. Keep a pace.
- Okay.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't spit that shit out.
It's not free.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Keep that in.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ooh.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, how you doing?
I haven't heard from you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, you haven't.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, did I do
something wrong, or...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, here we go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's not you, it's me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Uh, I'm still
working on myself.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So I can't be a part of two
until I'm a better one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You don't have to do that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, wait.
My favorite's coming.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You make me want to
be a better woman.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I thought we had a good time.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We did have a lot of fun.
And now we're gonna move on.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let it go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right. Cool.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No hard feelings, right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, hit it.
Hit it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bye.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I didn't know how else to say it.
It's pretty clear.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's why you
don't feed strays.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Can we get two more...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...shots?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Six.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We should get a
few more of these, right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know, Mullins.
It's hard.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I know we're not
supposed to say this,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">but being a woman
in this field is hard.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Men are just so intimidated
by me, which is like... why?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And then you put your personality
on top of that and it is...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...it is off-putting.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know, I was actually
married for six some years.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Was he a hearing man?
Yes.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He didn't understand how
much the job meant to me,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">so I thought it'd
be best to just...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...be alone rather than
to compromise the work.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I get that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's kind of weird that it does
get lonely... a little bit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's hard to
make female friends.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I hung out, you know...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...really just with my brothers
and stuff growing up and...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...they just all turned out
to be terrible people.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So that's kind of a bummer.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Your family loves you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I mean,
in their own unique way,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">but they love you and
that's a wonderful...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Very unique.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That sounds like
it's coming from</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">somebody that's an only child.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I was actually raised
with a lot of children.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Other children?
What, in a circus?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, just in...
in the houses.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're a foster kid.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yes, I was.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No. Jesus, that clears up a lot.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Foster kid. That makes sense.
That's a tough go of it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, it was totally fine.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There was a lot of benefits
to being a foster kid.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah?
Yeah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">On Christmases, there was
this local drugstore</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">that would sponsor us and give us
little baggies of toiletries and stuff.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">On Thanksgiving, we would hit these
different putt putt golf courses.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You'd meet all kinds of...
Other sad kids?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No...
Oh, Jesus.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's the saddest series
of images I've ever heard.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't think it affected me in
the long run at all. At all.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're probably fine.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can see how maybe it was, like, a
little bit, but not anything that's...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe it has?
Oh, God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God, my life!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right. Let it
out, that's it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Good for you to start
working through it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't feel well.
I don't feel well.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're not
making me feel great.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right...
blow it out.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Really let it go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You've got more than that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Good job!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't feel well.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do you want some Jäger?
Two Jägers!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's hear it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Whoo!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is for you!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>The chills that you spill
Up my back keep me filled</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>With satisfaction
when we're done</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Satisfaction of what's to come</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sex walk!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look at it!
Look at it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look at it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Giving it to you!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Higher.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">My name...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...is Detective Mullins.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You'd better lay your ass down.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I smell bacon.
I smell bacon.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I smell bacon.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Biscuits are done!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's do it again!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No! Stop playing this song!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why? Because you played
it 26 fucking times.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey! She's a foster kid. Yeah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She had Q-tips and tampons
and shit for Christmas.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She's had a horrible,
fucking miserable life.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look at her!
Yeah!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right.
Play the goddamn song.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't you fucking swear at us.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yes, you celebrate your music.
Okay.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Everybody, get up!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come dance!
Come on!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get up, you fuck!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get on!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look, it's a frenzy.
We started a frenzy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're covered in nuts.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You've having a bad dream.
You're covered in nuts.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's give them a little something...
Hold still.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Spin me around
till I fell asleep</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Then up the stairs
he would carry me</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Girl you're every woman
in the world to me</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I love this place.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, to this...
to this place.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't feel it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Keep it up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Girl you're every woman
in the world to me</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>You're everything I need</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, crap.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, how long
have we been here?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, crap.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, focus.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know what? Here's this.
This counts as something.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's it.
I'm all in.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, how's it going?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Jesus, you've got to get
a mint in that dumpster.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God. Was I smoking
cigarettes last night?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, you kept taking them out of
people's mouths and smoking them.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">God, that's so nasty!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It was pretty gross.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why is my jacket in the pot?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't worry.
I'll get it right back.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's see what you got.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shit.
That's great.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Good evening.
That's great.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There you go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I didn't think you'd care
that much about your jacket.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You didn't care at all when
you gave away your car.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who did I give it to? To Wayne!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who's Wayne?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wayne! He just
walked out of here!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You were sitting
in his lap all night.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You had your
tongue down his throat.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God! It feels like
we've been hibernating!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Didn't bother you last night.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, Jesus, ten missed messages.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Will you get him, please?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wayne, Ashburn wants
her underwear back!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I do not! You cannot take that car!
It's government property.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, yeah? Well, I pay taxes,
so fuck the government!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's not, okay?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get out of the car,
you asshole!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shit! Wayne!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">God, your first boyfriend.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You two were electric.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How did Julian escape?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Federal marshals transferring
him got ambushed.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're not sure whether Larkin's
men followed the marshals</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">or got information
from the inside.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Isn't it obvious?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck you!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I know when I smell
a fucking albino rat.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If you want to point a finger,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">why don't you point it
at yourself?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If you two hadn't
brought Julian in,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Larkin would have never
known we were on to him!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And this whole case</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">wouldn't be the giant mixed-up
bucket of shit that it is now.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So fuck you and
your albino prejudice!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now Larkin knows who you are,
and Julian's angry as shit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If I were you,
I would get out of town.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You'd like that, wouldn't you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ashburn, he's right.
This isn't a choice.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No way!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're not my boss, Puss in Boots.
And even if you were...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...you still
couldn't stop me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I have more invested in this
case than any of you assholes.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And now you fucked it up!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's another fucked-up area of my life.
Thanks for bringing it up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, this was just
emailed to me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, fine. I guess
I'm out of line, huh.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll step back and see
what you assholes can do.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Go U.S.A. Let's go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We got to get my family out.
They're gonna kill them.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll talk to Hale. The FBI
can arrange everything.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you kidding?
We got a mole in there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm assuming it's the
albino, but we don't know.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It could be Levy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It could be somebody
from my precinct.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It could be your boss,
<i>Puss in Boots.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We are going in there by
ourselves and doing it now.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you with me or not?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is bullshit!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why should we uproot our lives
because you're an asshole?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't talk to her like that.
It's not her fault.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You want to bring everyone?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, but it'd be
like <i>Schindler's List.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dad! Come on, we cannot
fit that in the car!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't want them
to take my treasures.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, no, no!
I thought you were inside.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Say bye-bye.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Say bye-bye. No. I'll call
you when I get there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You are so rude.
I know. I'm so sorry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is my house!
Just go outside.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where are you going? Outside!
I'll be right back</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can see through your shirt.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God, are you serious?
Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you doing
with the bat?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just let 'em try to come over here, Shan.
Just let 'em try.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They're not gonna
throw soft balls at you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They're gonna shoot you, moron.
Get your bag.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Would you get over yourself
for Christ's sake?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bring it on, motherfuckers.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Not you, Mrs. Amendola.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hi. Can I drive?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, but if you could
make your way around...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get out and let me drive.
I'm a really good driver!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Mullins! Your mom.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Our lives are in danger. I
may have to change my name.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So if you get a call from
someone named Carla, it's me!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">When did you become
such a princess?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You make it impossible!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, seatbelts, everyone!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on, buddy...
come on.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right here, buddy!
Right here!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What the fuck is this?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's my puppy. I got
him four months ago.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I named him Kevin Garnett.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're an asshole!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You gotta see
the cock on this thing.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Move. We're not bringing this
fucking horse to a motel.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We gotta get Gina.
For what?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Because you put her
fucking life in danger!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nobody gives a shit about her.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If I'm going, Gina's going!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm not going
unless we get Gina.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just get in.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're getting Gina.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Move your feet,
I'll chop 'em off!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're going to Gina's!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I hope a truck
hits us and we all die.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What the fuck is
this girl doing?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Could she go any slower? Could
she physically go slower?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Go get your girlfriend.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She's fine, Ma!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I forgot my curling
iron, Mrs. Mullins!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on, Gina, get in the car!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What the fuck?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got you the rollie so you could roll the bag!
So get over here!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You kidding?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You bought me
a bag for Christmas</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">so that I could
carry my own luggage?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Gina, come on...
let's go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm gonna get you
a dick-sucker for Christmas</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">so I don't have to
do it no more.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Go get her!
Jesus! I'm going!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Gina! You really
didn't say that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, that's why you're here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Go get her.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on, Pete, just break
up with this girl!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's go, let's go!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're making a scene,
you assholes!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You think you're man enough?
You fucking man enough?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Knock it off!
Just knock it off!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got this!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey! Assholes!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get in the car! Get in the car!
Get in the car!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Did she just pull outa gun?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know what happens now?
You don't get this one!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So, Jason,
your family seems nice.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, we have our good days.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">My make-up is
in that one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll rip your pants off!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If we just knew where that
shipment was coming to,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">we would have
Larkin and Julian.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They would both be there,
and we could get them.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm just happy that Jason
is out of there for now.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shame, though.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Having your brother on the
inside would be a coup for us.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's what you want to say?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Because you're
saying that out loud.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You would say exactly the same
thing if it wasn't your brother.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're done talking about this.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So if it was just
some random drug dealer,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">you wouldn't send him back in?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If it was someone like Rojas...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're not talking about Rojas.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're talking about my
brother, you fuckwit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We all have a lot to lose
if we don't catch Larkin.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What do you have to lose?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I have a lot.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Some bullshit promotion?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You don't give
a shit about my family</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">or if Jason gets out
there and gets killed.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I feel you're not being honest.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Because nobody forced your brother
to get involved with drugs.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're an asshole for that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, that's not
helping, either.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm trying to
create a dialogue.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Note that I start my
statements with "I feel".</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, I feel like
you're an asshole.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know what I feel?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I feel that you have worn that
shirt every day this week.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And I feel that you
turning it inside out</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">does not make it a new shirt.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, I feel like it does</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, really? Well, I
feel I disagree.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Must be nice.
What?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Must be really nice
for you to know everything.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">To be so much smarter
than everybody else.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't profess to know everything,
but I do know quite a bit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What I know is accurate
and scientifically proven,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and I share that
information with you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If you have
a problem with that,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">tune me out like you always do.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Help! He's choking!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, I've got it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Somebody call an ambulance!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Check his mouth!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There's nothing there!
Okay, lay him down.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sir, relax.
Everything will be fine.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let me get his head back.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He's choking. I need a
knife and a straw, please!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A knife and a straw!
Why a knife and a straw?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm going to perform
an emergency tracheotomy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll need a glass of vodka.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Vodka! It's a Denny's!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">For sterilization.
Hot water!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do you know what you're doing?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Technically, no...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...but I've been
doing some research</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and I feel fairly
confident I know how.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He's still choking!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sir, what I'm going
to do is find your...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Please don't put that in there.
Shh. Stop touching me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I think the cricothyroid membrane is here.
I'll make a small incision...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let go of my hand.
Please don't do that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm going to make
a small incision.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The reason I'm doing this...
is because you're choking.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm gonna cut in... just a
little bigger...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That goes in
deeper than I thought.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now I'm going to
insert my fingers.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't put your finger in there!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There is the membrane.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's a fucking horror show! Don't
put your fingers in there!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sir, what I'm going to do is
insert the straw in the hole...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...and it will allow the
oxygen to get to your brain.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">In one moment, you will feel the
oxygen flow into your brain.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's not oxygen.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's not oxygen!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's a lot of blood.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God,
there's so much blood!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know what I'm doing!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Stop crying!
You did this!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">When's the ambulance coming?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got it! Move!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm so sorry</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So much blood!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You asshole!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You probably
could have just pulled</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">the piece of pancake
out of his throat.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He's alive, isn't he?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I have a cut on my arm
from earlier.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do you think I
should amputate it?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know you're
not a real doctor?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Neither are you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bye-bye! You're a
reckless person.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Thank you.
Not you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ashburn.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why don't you
have your own phone?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who am I, the Queen of England?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know. Does the Queen of
England only wear sweatpants?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck you.
You F you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is Mullins.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shannon, I left. I couldn't
sit there anymore.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What? Where are you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I talked to them and everything's fine.
Nothing's weird, we're good.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It doesn't work
that way, Jason.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They know you're my brother.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But they also
know you arrested me</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and that made it seem
like I hated you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, it doesn't work that way.
Shut up for a minute!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Look, I know where the
shipment's going to.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't give a shit
about the shipment!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just get your
ass back here now.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm gonna stick around or
they'll know something's weird.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get off me!
It's my phone.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Trust me, I'm trying
to do the right thing.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you kidding me?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>What?</i>
Jason! Jason!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let go of my vest!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shannon?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's Ashburn. What the
fuck is going on?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What have you got?
Don't talk to her!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The shipment's coming to the Boston
Harbor Shipyard at 11 o'clock.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>It's a big freight, tons of guys.</i>
I got it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>They'll be heavily armed. You
got to be careful, you hear me?</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The ship is called the S.S.
Tank or something like that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I promise we'll be there.
<i>I got to go.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll break your fucking arm!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, take it easy!
Just take it easy!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shit!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You just made my
brother a dead man!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, he's gonna be fine.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Mullins, I swear he'll be fine.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're gonna have
the full power of...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...the Boston FBI down on that
terminal tonight, I promise you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He'll be fine.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It really is a good thing.
You'll thank me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shut up!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- All right.
<i>- The ship's coming in.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Time to lock and load.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, here we go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Police! Put your hands up!</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">FBI! Get your fucking hands in the air now!
Let's see 'em!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Boat's clean.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's not clean. We found
a joint in that girl's purse.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, now...
this is really a mess.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sir, we just have to
hit the streets again.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And if the shipment came in...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ashburn, enough.
It's over.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm sending you
back to New York.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sir, no, please!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm telling you, I'm so close.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This was just a little hiccup.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It wasn't a hiccup.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Lo siento.</i>
Don't.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't even...
Oh, God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Um, sorry. Detective Mullins.
Have you seen her?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hospital. Some kind
of family emergency.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He's in an induced coma.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They shot him and left
him out in the street.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm so sorry, Mullins.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm sorry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He was trying to move on.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He had a job interview.
I saw the resume.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It was a terrible resume.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He mentioned prison and...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...in Special Skills he said,
"Keeping it real", but...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...he was trying.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How's your family holding up?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They're not talking to me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Blame me now more than ever.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's not your fault.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yes, it is.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Damn it, I should have
handled it by myself!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So that's it?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm not your partner anymore?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, you're not. You're another
fucking disappointment.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I want you to know that I'm gonna
find the man responsible for this.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, Shannon.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Uh, that was wicked rude.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>You can live your life</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>In a crowded city</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>You can walk along
a crowded street</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>But the city
really ain't no bigger</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Police!
Put your hands up!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Really?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>But it don't do too
much good to be talkin'</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Brother, when there ain't no</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Ain't nobody listening</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll give these back to you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Thank you so much
for your help.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Anytime.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're gonna miss
you around here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, I don't think so.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I might.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You did a good job out there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just keep your fingers out of guys' necks.
It's nasty.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bye.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We sent out alerts
to airports, train stations.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">DEA's gonna take
the lead on this one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Although this is
a joint task force,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">we're also working
with the Boston P.D.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Adam and I will be handpicking</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">all the officers so we
don't wind up with this.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Any questions?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's not right.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, it's not.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That officer you're making fun
of and all laughing at...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...has more integrity,
commitment,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">courage and guts than
anybody in this room.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah... but less
mental stability.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So just to be clear,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">what does mental
instability look like?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Keeping people safe?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Protecting the community?
Getting the job done?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Is that what it looks like?
Then great.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If that's what it looks like,
sign me up for the crazy house!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That officer right there...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...is a better law enforcement
officer than anybody in this room.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Myself included. She is better than
you, she is better than you...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...and she is definitely
better than you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you doing? Are you texting?
Playing a game?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What is it? Put it away!
God, you guys!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What is the matter with you?
You're just such jerks!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're just such...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're just a shit-jerk! You're
just a shit-jerk dick... fucker!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're a shit-jerk
dick-fucker assholer!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And you just go
fuck yourselves!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sorry, <i>señor,</i> not you.
Pardon, please.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just... all you fuckers!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get on the ground!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You are under arrest!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Put your hands up and tell me where
the fuck Larkin is!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I think it'd be much more better
if you put your hands up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"Much more better?"</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Drop the gun and take a
grammar course, you idiot.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who the fuck are you?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Me and her...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...we're the fucking heat.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right... we've got some
scumbags to visit, huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, we do.
Get up, asshole!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where's Larkin?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't even know who that is.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where is he?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know who
the fuck that is!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Really? It's clean?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You not finding anything?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nothing in here?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, hold on a second.
How about this? Right there!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right there!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Got your pizza!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Got your pizza, mister!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fresh hot pizza!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get on your knees!
Where's your stash?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't have anything yet.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm waiting to get some
from a new distributor.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who's your new distributor?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shit, man!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Guess who.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Surprise.
Come on, man!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know what y'all are doing here!
I'm out of the game.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know what I hate? Drugs.
I'm a different man!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is not mine.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I just bought that
refrigerator the other day.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This must have been in there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We want to know
where all this new shit</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">is coming from.
Where is Larkin?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bitch, what part of "I'm out"
do you not understand? I'm out!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You want to interview him?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No. No. I think I have
something better in mind.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shit! I don't know shit!
Come on!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know, you're
getting awfully heavy, Rojas.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, lie to me again.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I want to feel your body sliding
through my delicate hands.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know shit!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Whoa, I can't hold you!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I don't want to die!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't want to die!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay! It's at a warehouse!
On Summer Street!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm almost disappointed.
Get me up!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's pull him up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I'm not kidding.
I can't lift him up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can't lift him!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I've only done this
one other time</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and it was
a really tiny hooker.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Lift my ass up!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You ain't putting
nobody over no rails</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">you can't fucking
lift them out!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, okay!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Uh... Just tuck your head
and relax your body.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Lady, what the fuck?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Crap! Crap!
Get me up!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Thank you again!
Thank you!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That was on me.
I take that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I hope this ain't my car.
This is my car?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">On, shit! My 2003!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's load up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Hey, I can be the answer</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I'm ready to dance

<font face="Trebuchet MS">You hungry? I got a
sandwich I didn't finish.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Is that the same sandwich
you offered me a week ago?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's cheese.
Cheese doesn't go bad.</font>

<font face="Trebuchet MS">I like those odds.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Boston P.D.!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get down on the ground!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's right,
that's how we roll. Come on.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You guys are all coming back
from break at the same time?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Unfortunate.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You guys get less attractive
every time I see you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Put the fucking guns down.
No, thanks.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nice entrance, Teen Wolf.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You look like a Ninja Turtle.
Take it easy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I've held someone at gunpoint</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">for 72 hours before.
Let's go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We need to do what he says.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's the best thing.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We gonna shoot our way out of this?
Put the gun in the bag.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, hold your gun up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Give them the bag,
give them everything!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Goddamn you. I thought
you had my back.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Put it in the bag
and slide it over, now.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's in the bag!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Slide the bag over!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sorry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I guess you and her
are engaged now, huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, because...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...you just gave me
a ring, motherfucker!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shit!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, stop, stop!
Okay, that feels broken.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Pull it out.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's out!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nice work.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How many of you are there?
Really!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How funny.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is like when you were interrogating
me, only now you're tied up...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...and I've got
all these knives.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know, I don't
like to shoot people.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I like cutting people up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's kind of what I do.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I like that one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's a good small one.
Good choice, it's small.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You like this?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Not too flashy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is actually
an oyster shucking knife.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Either of you ladies
need your oyster shucked?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Not at the moment.
Not me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got to tell you,
I've done this</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">a lot of times
to a lot of people...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...but you two, you're
gonna be the most fun.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Larkin's here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Larkin.
Upstairs.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This fun will have to wait.
The boss is here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Can you please excuse
me a second, ladies?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sure, take what time you need.
Yeah, take your time.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, cool.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, also, um...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...would you mind
holding this for me?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, my hands are tied,
but I can certainly try.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, let me help you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Jesus!
Thanks.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Shit!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Breathe through the pain...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, do that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do that, do that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Breathe it out, breathe it out.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, Mullins.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If we should perish...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're not gonna.
Just shh!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I know I'm not very
good with my feelings...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...but I need to
tell you something.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You are smart.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You are smart and
you are intuitive.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And you're the best cop
I've ever worked with.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You, too, thank you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You were right. I went back and
looked at the evidence and...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...I think the Red Falls
Killer is innocent.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Did you happen to
mention that to anybody</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">before you put yourself in a
life-threatening situation?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I didn't!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Jesus! Good luck... you're taking
that to your grave probably.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck, the other leg!
Fuck, the other leg!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You can move your chair,
too, you know.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I am moving my chair.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just grab the knife.
Take it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just take it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm sorry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got it! Shit!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just come on, all right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I am doing it as fast as I can.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's almost there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Got it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hurry up, hurry up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hurry up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What?
Somebody's coming up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Got to put it back in. What?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got to put it back in.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And I'll put my hands
behind my back.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">When he gets close,
I'll grab him.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But you got to shut up
and let me put it back in.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, just put it in.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you doing?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sorry, it doesn't
go in that easy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just shut up!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Motherfucker!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm sorry. Oh, shit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll pretend to
keep my hands tied.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shut up, shut up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, no, Scoob! Velma and
Daphne got captured!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I never thought I'd
be happy to see you guys.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We got to get her
to the hospital.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Did you guys call this in?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I sent a fucking
owl with a note.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How did you even
know we were here?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We followed you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I knew you wouldn't
give up easily,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">especially not after they
greased your shitbag brother.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck you. It takes a lot more than
Larkin to take down a Mullins.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Jason's not dead?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on, Adam.
Larkin is on his way.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What is this, a Q and A?
Can we do this later?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wait. Did he talk to the police?
Did he see Larkin?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How is she supposed to know? He's
been in a coma. Untie my leg.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's too bad. Where is he?
Is he at Boston General?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why? You gonna send
him fucking flowers?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why are you so...?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You piece of shit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You guys are
working with Larkin.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I really wish you
hadn't said that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Said What?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God!
Shit!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That felt good!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It wasn't the albino.
I feel bad.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He wasn't working for Larkin.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He just wanted you off the case</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">'cause he's
a misogynistic asshole.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why are you doing this? You
getting some kind of payoff?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I was in the beginning.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Six years dealing
with these lowlifes,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">making shit money...
Ah!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're Larkin.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Holy shit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ta-da!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get it? Right?
Makes perfect sense!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now I'm bragging, but it's very
nice having a second income.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I heard shots.
What the...?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Aw, the albino.
That guy was hilarious!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Boss, I don't think that
was such a good idea.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You spend three years in a van
with him, you'd kill him, too.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We'll pin it on LeSoire.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I've got to go to the
hospital to finish Jason.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You deal with these two. No loose ends.
Mmm-hmm.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You fucking rat.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We told you to stay out of the way.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Good-bye.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You fucking rat!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">See you, buddy.
Don't call me buddy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He's actually a great guy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...let's have some fun.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I've been waiting to
do this a long time.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Campbell soup, you're up first.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Please don't hurt us.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Please. I didn't mean
to say the shit I said.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't hurt us.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Mullins, gun at two-thirty!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You take one step
and your partner gets it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shit.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nice.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, God!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look at me.
Are you okay?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I think I'm gonna throw up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That was
a really bad head-butt.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It was good... but
you're gonna feel it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Go!
Get yourself untied.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Then we're gonna go
get Jason. Got it?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why won't they
answer the fucking phone?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Go, go, go!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, dick-fucker!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get off the fucking phone!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Useless!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We got something!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got it.
Get her on the stretcher.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I got it. I got it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Thank you.
Thank you very much.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wow, crap.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Here we go. Oh, crap.
All right. Got to turn.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Call 911!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You won't shoot me?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just call it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where is my brother,
you asshole?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's that kind of language
from your family</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">that forced us to move
him to the east wing.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Move, dipshit!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Jason, I'm coming!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What the fuck?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on, come on.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This stupid chair!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Screw it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's amazing what a little air</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">in the bloodstream
does to the human heart.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You may not want to watch this.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wait!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I just want you to know
that I get it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I get it. I mean...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...I've been on the job
a long time and...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...you just see so many bad
things and bad people and...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...you just start to wonder if
there's anybody good anymore and...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...I just want you to know that
you don't have to do this.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You don't have to do it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I know.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But I do.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Because I have plans
that don't involve</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">me going to prison
with people I put there.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So say good-bye
to your mick brother.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wait!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Drop it or I'll
fire this weapon!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Or I inject...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, you shot him in the dick!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Twice.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shit!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I took a page right out
of your book, partner.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But I've never done it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I just aim it at it. I don't actually do it.
That's too fucking crazy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What about Julian?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I take the bullets out!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I just use it as a tactic to scare him.
I mean, Jesus, I'm not crazy!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't make me
feel bad about it!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I know.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ooh, watch that leg.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You did good, little buddy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You saved my brother's life.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Internal Affairs is going to open
a top-to-bottom investigation</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">of every department now.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nice work.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, it was
a team effort, sir.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, we put out
an APB on Julian.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, don't bother,
he's in the trunk.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, and, sir...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...we're going to have to reopen
the Red Falls Killer case.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Good for you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I thought that would feel
good, but it felt awful.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's probably
gonna just keep feeling bad.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But I'm glad you did it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Should we be
leaving the hospital?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, shit. No.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Probably not.
Probably not. Spin it.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's take this one.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get up here.
Is that clean?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's clean enough.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God! It smells like
several people died on here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let me just sit. I don't
need to be on my face!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You can help the process.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Not clean!
Inchworm it up.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, that's good.
Just flip me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get off the leg,
get off the leg.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't fall off!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I want this place
locked down, people!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nobody goes in or out
without talking to me!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I want you three stationed at each
end of the east wing. Let's go!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's clear
this hallway, people!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get the press out of here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You Okay?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, yeah, I'm good.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I knew you would be.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm good, too.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Excuse me.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This woman is one of the
best agents in the FBI.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Make sure she's well taken care of.
All right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That was...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That was interesting, right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I would look into that.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What is that?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, let's go.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You actually have to stay here.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, just do what you
can to save that leg.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, I'm not a doctor.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, fucktard,
I know you're not a doctor.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But tell it to the doctor!
How about that?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right! I'll wait
right here for you!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Throw out that sandwich!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll bring you that sandwich!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No! Throw it out!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You got it, buddy.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">For outstanding service...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...Officer Shannon Mullins.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There you go, Shannon! That's
what I'm talking about!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now hold it up!
Hold it up! Yeah!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Take out the gun!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Just a little snooze, man.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I move to
cake-toast to Jason!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah! To Jason!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">May I have your attention?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I wanted you to have this.
It was your grandmother's.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She would have been
very proud of you</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">for taking care
of your brother.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's awesome.
Take a picture.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Take a picture!
Come on, take a picture!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you serious?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"Dunkin' Jesus"?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No cell phones.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How about now?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, different story?
Aw, come on back!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Hey, it's me.</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So, you getting all
settled in your new digs?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Yeah, they're pretty sweet. Who
needed that promotion anyway?</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm glad I stayed around
where all the action is.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We got a lot of scumbags
to take down here in Boston.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, we do.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Hey... did you get
that package I sent?</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, I haven't opened it yet.
I'm sorry.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Your dad sent me
something, too.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So it's like
the Mullins gift day.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh. Okay.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I signed it in the front.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Does that mean you broke
into my house again?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe, maybe not.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Amazing how that door
opens all by itself.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I see it. Very funny.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I know. I was just kidding.
Look at the back.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Oh, you wrote something
else mean and...</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...profanity-laden
in the back?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay, here it is.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well... don't make it weird.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Later, nerd.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It takes a nerd to know a nerd.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Okay. You made it weird. Bye.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I left my baby in the car.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, there's, uh...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...something I've been
thinking about a lot</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">that's been bothering me and...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got you something.
Oh.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I found your friend.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Pumpkin!
Awesome, right?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I drove all the way
to New Jersey,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and I was up and down these
streets, looking all over.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I was just about to give up,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and I was over
by your old place,</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and suddenly I hear
this little bell.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I thought, wait a minute! I looked
in your neighbor's window...</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">...and I saw this asshole
sitting right on the couch.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I said,
"You are coming with me,"</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"even if you don't want
to go back with her."</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, he fought you, huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, he fought me pretty hard.
Wow.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But I'm just glad that I
could make this reuniting.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What a surprise this is, huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What a surprise, huh?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look at where you are!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This was never your cat, was it?
No.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Goddamn it. Put him in the box.
Put him in the box!</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Can you put him back?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do I have a lot of choice?</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Can you make sure he's got</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">lots of water?
Just don't.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He likes to snuggle.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't make me put the
cat down and punch you.</font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>It's no use
We're gonna have to fight</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>You've thrown your words
'round a thousand times</i></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Like a child

up in my head</i></font>
