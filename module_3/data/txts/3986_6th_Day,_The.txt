<i>Hey! This is Johnny Phoenix for the XFL,</i>
<i>reminding fans here at Prudential Stadium
to be safe on the way home.</i>
Big third down for the expansion Roadrunners.
Their playoff hopes could hinge on this play.
A lot of pressure on young Johnny Phoenix.
As if being the first quarterback to earn
$300 million isn't pressure enough.
Red! Thirty-two!
Run left!
Blue! Two, thirty-nine!
Blue!
Hut!
Get up, Johnny!
You all right?
The owner wants Johnny to have
the absolute best of care.
He's gonna need it.
His 6th cervical vertebra is crushed.
lt may not be as bad as you think it is.
- <i>So, what's the status?</i>
- The status?
We have a lifetime contract
with a vegetable.
Maybe we could trade him to L.A.
<i>Okay, I want you to terminate his contract.</i>
Sure.
l'll get right on it.
Sorry, Johnny. You're going
to have to take one for the team.
Do l look any different to you?
Oh, gee.
You shaved your moustache.
l never had a moustache.
Then, no.
<i>Johnny Phoenix will play next week.</i>
<i>Early diagnosis had him sidelined.</i>
<i>After further investigation,
his injuries proved to be minor.</i>
<i>Good morning, Adam. At 11:00,
you have a VlP client, Michael Drucker.</i>
<i>And by the way, happy birthday.</i>
l didn't feel different.
- ls Clara up yet?
- She's watching TV with Oliver.
You gonna spend all day
looking for new wrinkles?
Or are you gonna get in here
and give me a kiss?
l suppose if l have to.
Bully! No, you're not getting any kisses now.
You know, you don't look any different.
No. You look much better than when we met.
l love you.
Lock the door.
Oh, God.
Daddy! Daddy! Happy birthday!
You always make Daddy feel so good.
Careful, you're getting a little old for that.
l am not.
No, l meant your father.
- Very funny.
- Come on. l made you breakfast.
- Oh, great. l love it.
- Oh, yum!
- Come on, Dad!
l can't find you. Where are you?
l'm right behind you, Dad. I'm here.
- Right here.
- Hiding under the table.

Nacho-flavoured or regular?
l'll take banana-flavoured. Thank you.
l love this card. Beautiful.
Dad, can l have a Sim-Pal for your birthday?
You want a gift on my birthday?
That way you won't feel guilty that
you're the only one getting something.
- What's a Sim-Pal?
- A life-size doll.
A make-believe friend that grows real hair
and can do a lot of stuff.
Can't your real friends grow real hair
and do lots of stuff?
Yeah, but they all have Sim-Pals.
Ask your mommy.
You're the greatest, Dad.
Mommy! Mommy!
l'm gonna get a Sim-Pal!
<i>You are getting low on milk.</i>
<i>Thank you for ordering milk.</i>
You're getting so fast.
lnto the car.
Very nice. Bye-bye.
See you.
- Hey.
- What's going on?
- l had a breakfast of champions today.
- Oh, yeah?
<i>Destination Double X
Charter Airport selected.</i>
The girl wouldn't stop talking.
My virtual girlfriend, she talks,
but at least l can turn her off.
You and your virtual girls.
I mean, you're a grown man, and your primary
relationship is with a piece of software.
Yeah, if all your senses tell you have a hot chick
on your lap, then you have a hot chick on your lap.
l don't need to look any further, okay?
You know, they invented something
called the Laser Razor.
No nicks, cuts ot scratches.
You should think about using it.
l like the old-fashioned kind.
They remind me l'm still alive.
Hey, you want to hang out
at Kelly's after work?
l know that Natalie is throwing me
a surprise party.
- Why do you say that?
- Because l told her you told me.
- No, you didn't.
- Oh, yes.
Why did you do that?
l didn't. l just wanted to know
and now l know.
I can't believe l was that easy.
<i>Your destination, Double X
Charter Airport, is ahead.</i>
<i>OnStar will now disengage automatic drive.</i>
- <i>Are you ready?</i>
- Yes.
<i>Manual drive engaged.</i>
Hey, I want you to do me a favour
at the party tonight.
What? Don't get drunk and set the drapes
on fire? You already told me that.
That too.
But what l was going to say was
around 11:00 - 11:30,
l want you to start singing really loud
"Happy Birthday".
- For what?
- The way you sing,
it's gonna clear out the place like a bum skier.
l get it. You and Natalie have
a little private party planned.
Good morning, Rosie.
Good morning, everybody.
Henry checked out the upgrade
on the remote. Says you'll love it.
They came in.
This is great. Look at this!
And Drucker's office just called.
Guess what?
They cancelled.
No. We're all gonna be tested
for drugs and alcohol.
So? Oh, this is cool!
We're gonna be tested?
Not you guys. Just us pilots.
Hey, Hank! Look at this. The new remote
came in. Out goes the old one.
Get rid of it! Hey, Adam, this is Tripp.
Tripp, this is Adam. lt's his first time with us.
- Hey, welcome.
- How're you doing?
Adam? Natalie's on line one.
What's up, honey? You look upset.
<i>Oh, Adam.</i>
<i>l just talked to the vet, and they...</i>
<i>they had to put Oliver to sleep.</i>
What? He wasn't even that sick.
<i>I know, l know. But apparently
he had some kind of, I don't know,</i>
<i>highly infectious canine virus or something.</i>
<i>And they had to put him down. lt's the law.</i>
Oliver was licking Clara's face this morning.
<i>Don't worry, because l asked the same thing,</i>
<i>and the virus is harmless to humans.
So, she's fine.</i>
This is going to break her heart,
and you know that.
<i>No, it won't.</i>
<i>I want you to go down to RePet</i>
<i>and get Oliver replaced.</i>
l'm not going to have some freak of
science sleep in my daughter's bed.
- <i>lt's not dangerous.</i>
- No!
Oliver can live in our memories.
<i>She's only 8.
She won't understand that, honey.</i>
Look, it's the natural process of life.
You're born, you live and you die.
She has to learn about it some day.
<i>But she doesn't have to learn about it
on your birthday.</i>
l really appreciate that, honey.
- <i>Will you do it?</i>
- No.
- <i>Thank you, darling, and Clara thanks you.</i>
- But I won't do it.
- <i>Love you. Bye.</i>
- No, no, listen. Natalie, l won't...
<i>Double X Charter.
Your passport to adventure.</i>
No use fighting.
We always win.
<i>For incredible skiing and snowboarding,
Double X Charter.</i>
- Hey, Tripp, you can go in this one.
- Yeah, you got it.
You guys come with me.
Let's go!
Man, this is gonna be so great!
<i>9747, you are cleared for takeoff.</i>
Everyone has their maps?
GPS? Emergency beacons?
All right. Good. Any questions?
Yeah, l got a question. Excuse me,
how many of you have RePets?
- Yeah, l got a dog.
- l got a snake.
- Dogs, snakes, at least know somebody who has one?
- l get your point.
- l know somebody, yeah.
- All right, just asking.
You scared the crap out of me.
- You proud of yourself?
- Very.
See you guys!
Look, l know you're old-school, but all
the kids today, they grow up with RePets.
These days it's totally normal.
Not to me.
Not to you. You want yout kid crying
all night, because her dog died?
Don't do anything about it.
Where's your heart?
- Don't you think it's even a little bit creepy?
- No.
l don't.
Let's test the remote.
See if you can keep up with me.
All righty. Here we go.
I'm telling you, these RePets, they come
back, you cannot tell the difference.
- Trust me. l had it done.
- Bullshit.
l'm serious! Sadie, my cat, she's a RePet.
You had your cat cloned?
- Yeah, well, she fell out of my condo window.
- Ouch.
Shit.
- Hey, you did well.
- Thank you.
How long are you supposed
to keep me at Kelly's?
Till 7:00. Why?
Maybe l should check out RePet.
Good morning.
Are you gentlemen the owners?
Yep, that's us.
Excellent. Larry Stern,
l'm with Mr. Drucker's advance team.
l've got a contract here. I think
you'll find it pretty standard except for...
- Who was flying that one?
- Me, with the remote control.
We can fly four of these
between the two of us now.
- Amazing.
- Are you here for the blood test?
No, my technician is set up in your office.
You said these forms are standard
except what?
It's our normal charter contract.
lt has a nondisclosure clause.
During the flight you may overhear
Mr. Drucker's phone calls.
It could be anything from big mergers
to inside information on his sports teams.
Regardless, we have a legal obligation
to protect that stuff.
What this guy think, he's the president?
Oh, no. He considers her to be the
world's second most important person.
That's big stuff.
All for a day of snowboarding?
The blood test was agony.
Seriously, l'm screaming.
She's just kidding. Don't worry about it.
lt really doesn't hurt.
Just press your thumb here.
- Right here?
- Yes, just like that.
- All done.
- Didn't feel a thing.
Now I need to check your vision.
Place your chin here, look straigh ahead.
- Right here?
- Mm-hm.
Do you blood-test all your pilots?
Pilots, drivers, security people, assistants.
Basically, anyone who comes
in contact with Mr. Drucker.
- All right, l press here?
- Yep.
And here.
Perfect, both of you.
After this, l'm going to town
to test a chef and two waiters.
The pink copy of the charter contract
is yours.
l'll take the rest.
- Here we go.
- Have a nice flight, gentlemen.
- Thank you.
- Ta-ta.
You know, l can take care of Drucker. That way,
you'll get plenty of time to get Oliver cloned.
l'm not getting the dog cloned.
l'm just gonna check it out.
l know you're gonna check it out,
but once you see it, you're gonna say yes.
I know deep down inside, you're a softy.
Um... They specifically asked for Adam...
- by name.
- Yeah, l know what "specifically" means.
l also know that the bodyguards
can't tell the difference.
They never got our names.
That's true.
Look, Adam, l know that l screw around
a lot, but when it comes to flying,
you know l'm serious. l could do it.
Go enjoy your birthday.
lf you want to be me,
try to act a little bit more manly.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Chest out.
- Chest.
- Stomach in.
- Stomach.
- There you are.
- All right.
All clear.
Get me the Speaker of the House.
I want the Speaker there.
No, you don't mention my name at all.
Huh?
Hang on a second, babe.
Hi, l'm Michael Drucker.
You must be Adam Gibson.
That's right. Adam's the name,
and flying's the game.
Pete Hume speaks very highly of you.
Says you know the mountains like nobody else.
Thank you. That's probably true for everyone
except for my partner, but thank you.
Great. l'm looking forward to it.
- So, we all set?
- Yes, sir. We've stationed our people monitoring--
- Don't need the details.
- Yes, sir.
All right!
Your favorite snowboard's
right behind your seat, sir.
Dave, look, we gave a lot of money
to his campaign,
not to mention what l pay your law firm,
so l'm counting on you, all right?
You're gonna get me the Speaker?
Good.
So, Sally, who's next? Okay, put him on.
Hey, you own the Roadrunners, right?
Hey, buddy, wake up.
Wake up.
We're here. Woodland Mall.
l was asleep.
<i>Welcome to Woodland Mall.
Over 1,200 retail outlets to serve you.</i>
<i>Food court, ground level.
Megaplex theatre, 15th level.</i>
Stop the cloning. Say no to RePet.
Stop the cloning. Say no to RePet.
Stop the cloning.
Save your soul, man.
God doesn't want you to go in there.
Don't  go in there, man.
Then God shouldn't have killed my dog.
Atheist.
Stop the cloning. Say no to RePet.
<i>We can clone your four-legged
loved one in just a few short hours.</i>
<i>How can we do it?</i>
<i>lt all begins with the growing of "blanks",</i>
<i>animal drones stripped of
all characteristic DNA</i>
<i>in embryonic tanks at the RePet factory.</i>
<i>In stage two, your pet's DNA</i>
<i>is extracted from a lock of fur
or a drop of blood,</i>
<i>and then infused on a cellular level
into the blank.</i>
<i>ln the final stage, using RePet's
patented cerebral syncording process,</i>
<i>all of your pets thoughts,
memories and instincts</i>
<i>are painlessly transplanted
via the optic nerve.</i>
Still can't make up your mind, huh?
You lost a dog, right?
Yes, my daughter's.
What a heartbreak.
What did you say was his name again?
- Oliver.
- Well, Oliver's in luck,
because we're having a special
this week, 20% off.
- When did Oliver die?
- Some time this morning.
That's perfect. We can still do
a post-mortem syncording.
But you got to act fast, because there's only
a 12-hour window on deceased brains.
l have a problem with the whole idea.
I mean, suppose the clones have
no soul or they're dangerous?
Clone pets are every bit as safe as real pets.
Plus...
they're insured.
But if it is so safe,
then why is it against the law
to clone human beings?
Because the human brain is
much too complicated to syncord.
Now, you remember that experiment
they did, right?
- Yes.
- That's why it didn't work.
Now it's illegal to even try.
But with pets, it's a totally proven technology.
Your RePet Oliver
will be exactly the same dog.
He'll know all the same tricks
you taught him,
he'll remember where
all the bones are buried...
He won't even know he's a clone.
And did l mention...
they're insured.
Look, l don't care about the insurance.
l care about if l can trust my daughter
with a large animal with sharp teeth.
We can make him smaller if you want.
With softer teeth.
You can?
We can even colour-coordinate him
to match your decorating scheme.
<i>Sim-Pal, the best friend money can buy.</i>
Let me think about that.
<i>...who's fun to be with.
Treat your kids to a Sim-Pal today.</i>
Look, l might be back.
You'll be back.
Your daughter will think
you're the best dad in the world.
My kid-sister has two of these,
and she loves them.
Good.
Come, let's fix the collar.
There you are.
- lt's amazing how real this is.
- l know.
My daughter will be so excited.
Come, let's go home.
<i>You have called Hank Morgan.</i>
<i>Hi, I'm not here to take your call,
so, please, leave a message.</i>
Hank, it's me again.
What the hell happened to you? l waited
at Kelly's for over half an hour. lt's now...
- 5 past 7. It's--
- l'm Sim-Pal Cindy. What's your name?
Look, l'm heading home now.
lf you get this message...
- Let's be friends.
- Head home--
What's your name?
Can't you see that l'm talking? Quiet.
Head to my house with a bunch
of flowers and a good excuse,
otherwise Natalie's gonna kill you.
l can sing songs.
Would you like to sing with me?
- Excuse me, do you know how to turn this thing off?
- I can play games.
My niece has one.
Say: "Go to sleep, Cindy."
- I can sing songs.
- Go to sleep, Cindy.
Would you like to sing with me....
Go to sleep.
Thank you. Thanks for the ride.
Good night.
Clara, sweetie, honey.
Oliver was very sick
and he had to be put down.
Clara, sweetie, honey.
Oliver had to go to heaven.
"Why, Daddy?"
Well, you see, it's because...
It's because...
Shit, Oliver! Why did you have to die?
Oliver?
Natalie.
<i># Happy birthday to you #</i>
<i># Happy birthday dear Adam #</i>
<i># Happy birthday to you #</i>
<i>One, two, three!</i>
<i>That's amazing. Look at this cake!</i>
Oh, my God.
Adam Gibson?
Who are you?
We have a little situation.
Will you come with us, please?
What the hell is going on here?
Just cooperate and everything will be fine.
Fine? There's someone in my house,
eating my birthday cake,
with my family, and it's not me!
We know. There's been a 6th Day violation.
A human was cloned.
- That human was you.
- We can help you.
- Well, then get him out of there!
- But you'll have to come with us.
Now, look, l don't know who the hell
you people are...
- ...but l'm going inside my house.
- Yeah, right.
- Oops. Cindy fell down.
- Get the doll.
Not here!
l'm Sim-Pal Cindy. What's your name?
I can play games.
Shit.
Wiley, no! Hold your fire!
That way! Go!
Vincent, go!
l have a boo-boo.
Stop the car!
Stop the car!
Thanks for the suggestion.
Don't even blink.
- Oh, my God! Someone stole the minivan.
- I'll call the police.
No, they stole my Cadillac.
Oh, no.
Car chase. Cool.
- Who are you?
- l was hired to kill you.
That's all l know.
l'm Sim-Pal Cindy. What's your name?
<i>Please secure child-seat restraint.</i>
Let's be friends.
- Where is this guy?
- l'm Sim-Pal Cindy.
Let's be friends.
What's your name?
Will you be my mommy?
l don't want to be your mommy!
- Shut up!
- What?
Somebody do something
about that damn doll!
l have a boo-boo.
This is crazy.
Why does anyone want to kill me?
He got home first.
You saw him, he didn't see you.
You're screwed.
He's gonna live out the rest of your
boring little life and never be the wiser.
Your wife and kid see you and him
together, they'll be killed.
Shit!
Goddamn it, Wiley!
Son of a bitch!
Stupid!
Blow out his tyres this time!
Yes.
That was spectacular.
Son of a bitch.
Hold my belt.
Okay.
- You got me?
- Yeah.
Little more.
Let's get some people down the river
to look for this guy.
Go pick up Wiley and Talia's bodies
and get them back to the lab.
<i>l'm Dr. Griffin Weir. Welcome to the new
home of the Weir Organ Transplant Facility.</i>
<i>Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies.</i>
<i>We're in the business of life.</i>
Doctor Weir, protesters claim
that cloning human organs
will inevitably lead to
cloning whole humans.
Well, that's not only illegal, but we're years
away from the technical ability to do it.
But a human was cloned
over 10 years ago, doctor.
And we all know the outcome
of that bizarre experiment.
lf you recall, the Supreme Court
ordered the clone be destroyed,
and l think that uner the conditions
it was the humane thing to do.
lt led to laws against human cloning
and set back the course of
legitimate research by many years.
Mr. Drucker! Mr. Drucker!
You gave $100 million...
- This is Dr. Weir's night, okay?
- to help the Weir clinic.
Dr. Weir, is it true you're trying to get
the 6th Day laws repealed?
Dr. Weir is interested in medicine,
not politics.
Mr. Drucker, the protesters outside
claim that you run RePet at a loss
in order to soften people up
to the idea of human cloning.
You know, we shouldn't forget
that not so long ago,
there were literally almost
no more fish left in the ocean,
and half the world's population
faced a very real threat of hunger.
Our cloning technology helped
turn that around.
The extremists don't like to admit
that they'd rather the world went hungry
than eat cloned fish, so instead
they keep yelling about human cloning.
Do you think that human cloning laws
should be changed?
Suppose a 10-year-old boy lies in the
hospital bed, dying of liver cancer.
Thanks to Dr. Weir's work,
we can save that boy.
Now, in the next bed lies
another 10-year-old boy,
whose parents love him just as much,
only this child has an
inoperable brain tumour.
And you cannot clone a brain.
The only way to save him
would be to clone the whole person.
Now, how do you tell that boy's parents
that we can save the first boy,
but the research that would have
saved their son wasn't done,
because of a law that was passed by
frightened politicians a decade ago?
So, what does that mean?
- What are you going to do?
- Enjoy the party.
- Looks like you needed rescuing.
- Yes, Michael, l did. Thank you.
<b>Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!</b>
Hey, boss!
Johnny. How's my star quarterback?
l'd say l was feeling like a million bucks,
except l'd hate to take a cut in pay.
Don't remind me, all right?
That was one nasty hit you took last week.
Be careful son.
We don't want you getting killed out there.
Katherine? Are you all right?
l'm just feeling like l don't quite belong.
- No, no, no.
- But l'm fine. Really, I am.
No, you're not.
Should l call Dr. Stevens?
No, no, no. No, no, l just overdid it, that's all.
l'll get a car to take you home, okay?
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker? Thank you so much
for coming. Champagne?
- That was quite a speech.
- You heard that?
I didn't mean to get carried away.
Well, your words meant a great deal to me.
You see, as it happens, l have a son
with an inoperable tumour of the brain.
Oh, my God. l'm so sorry, sir.
lt must have been in my subconscious,
knowing you were here,
- but I never meant for you to overhear.
- No, no, it's quite all right.
Gave me a lot to think about.
In fact, it gave me a different view
of the whole subject.
Mr. Speaker,
could l offer you a glass of brandy
in my office upstairs?
l was 50 when Billy was born.
l didn't know if l wanted another kid so late.
But now l love him so damn much.
lf there were something
that we could do for Billy,
only it was highly illegal,
would you consider it?
Of course l would. That's the same
kind of hypothetical situation--
No, no. Don't answer so fast.
You'd be facing a mandatory minimum
sentence of 40 years if it ever came out.
But would he be cured?
He'd be exactly the same as he was before.
Perfect health.
He never even have to know it happened.
But if the secret ever did come out,
with the law the way it is now,
he'd be put to sleep like a rabid dog.
He'd be destroyed,
just like a horse with a broken leg.
And if it never came out?
Or if the laws were changed one day?
Then Billy wouldn't have
anything to worry about.
Please, l beg you.
Just go to my house and pick up
my wife and daughter.
Because if l go back there,
they will kill them both.
You made a completely different
police report an hour ago.
No, l didn't.
According to this, you did.
And they checked your thumbprint.
That must have been the clone.
Look, l know it sounds crazy.
l can hardly believe it myself.
- Was your car stolen or not?
- Yes.
- So you did report it?
- No, it was me who took it.
- You stole your own car?
- Yeah, but--
<i>Hello, l'm a court-appointed virtual attorney.
You don't have to answer that question.</i>
<i>ls my client being officially charged
with auto theft?</i>
l didn't steal it! lt's mine!
He claims the report was filed by his clone.
<i>l see. Loading the virtual psychiatrist.</i>
<i>Mr. Gibson, what seems to be the trouble?</i>
You want me to go through
the whole thing now with him?
<i>You seem to be avoiding
talking about your parents.</i>
<i>lmagine, Two turtles are walking
through the desert--</i>
Shut up!
- Hmm.
- Hmm, what?
- Are you going to help me or not?
- Of course we are.
<i>Medical alert transmitted. Awaiting data.</i>
Just wait in here. l'll come get you
as soon as we have some news.
Clones.
You know, he saw himself
at his house tonight.
Which was our mistake, not his.
Excuse me.
He's at precinct 7.
Can you hurry Talia and Wiley along,
please? l'll need them both.
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!
Piece of shit, Wiley!
l'm gonna kill him. Where is he?
He's still cooking.
Son of a bitch.
l look like crap.
Do you have any idea how much
my hair treatments cost?
How much does Gibson know?
He knows he's been cloned.
He knows we'll kill anyone
who sees the two of them together.
What's that? What?
Does Drucker know you're talking
about killing innocent people?
Relax. lt was just a threat.
Of course, we'd never actually do it.
Try to have a good night.
You do your hair.
l'll take Wiley and Vincent along.
l've got to pierce my damn ears again.
<i>Officials blame the latest strike
by US major league players,</i>
<i>now entering its 4th year...</i>
Shit.
Oh, no.
Now what?
lt feels tight all across here,
where the tyres ran over me, you know?
You were run over by two cars
and your chest was crushed.
Exactly. l mean, no wonder, right?
lt's in your mind.
Completely crushed.
As in dead.
As in you have a totally new chest now.
Then how come it's hard to breathe?
Tell you what.
Why don't you just stay out here, relax.
Fresh air will do you good.

You're dead.

<i>Hank, it's me again.</i>
<i>What the hell happened to you?</i>
<i>l waited for over half an hour at Kelly's.</i>
<i>lt's now 5 past 7.</i>
<i>l'm heading home, okay?</i>
He's fine. He's okay. He's our associate.
Gibson must have knocked him out.
Knocked him out? He's dead to me, doc.
No. Pulse is strong.
He'll be up and around in no time.
We'll just get him to the hospital.
Easy.
Let us know if you find Gibson.
Honey, l'm home.
Darling, where are you?
<i>Hi, sugar.</i>
Hello, my love.
<i>Have you been working out?</i>
- <i>You look so good.</i>
- Thank you.
<i>l recorded all your sports programmes for you.</i>
<i>I thought maybe we can watch them together.</i>
l would like that.
<i>Or should l just take this off right now?</i>
No, no, no. Hold your horses.
<i>Oh, Hank, l think it's so sexy
when you go right to the chair.</i>
l know you do.
<i>You're gonna have to zip me up, sweetheart.</i>
Careful with the merchandise.
Hold on, please!
- Have they been here?
- Who?
<i>Hello, Adam. Would you like a beer?</i>
Look, l'm sorry l missed the party, but...
all of a sudden it's 11 o'clock,
and l wound up at Kelly's.
- You missed my party?
- Yeah, but I didn't do it on purpose.
lt was sort of weird. I mean, I really... l feel
terrible about it. l don't know what happened.
You feel terrible? l lost my wife, my daughter
and my whole goddamn life tonight.
<i>...my special dance.</i>
Hank, listen.
l need your help.
Hey!
Hey, not now, cupcake! I can't now.
What's going on? l don't understand. What...?
That's a real gun.
What's going--?
Jesus Christ! What are you gonna do?
Kill my cat?
What the hell is going on?
lf you weren't at my party tonight,
then you didn't see him.
Who's "him"?
Jesus H. Christ. l said get
your dog cloned, not yourself.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna take my life back.
What? You're gonna kill him?
Why not? He's not real.
Plus, there's no law against it.
You're not serious, are you?
l'm dead serious.
But look at him. He looks just like you.
Technically, this could be committing suicide.
But he's not me.
He's not even human.
Wait a second. How do l know
he's not you and you're not him?
I mean, look at him.
He's even a shitty carpenter.
- Let me see your chin.
- My chin?
- Yeah, you cut yourself shaving, right?
- All right, here.
Okay, it's there. You're you.
Adam.
- l couldn't do it.
- Adam.
Over here.
l have a little something for you.
- ls Clara asleep?
- Yes, she is.
He's grabbing her ass.
l like how cigars make you feel.
Daddy?
Clara.
What are you doing out here?
l had a bad dream.
l'll take you back to bed, okay? Come on.
- Fireman.
- Fireman, right.
- Wait here.
- Okay.
Cigar, sir?
l can't wait.
- How do you like it?
- This is so good.
- Want to try some?
- No.
You know, smoking's illegal,
and l'm a mother...
Sweetheart, l'm so sorry about the RePet.
lt's all right.
Dad?
Did Oliver die?
ls he a RePet?
Why do you say that?
You locked him outside.
l did? Oh, l'm so sorry.
l haven't been myself lately.
All right. You go to sleep now.
Close your eyes.
When was the last time we did it
in the back seat of the car?
- We should smoke cigars more often.
- Done.
Mr. Gibson?
- Who are you?
- Millennium Security. Sorry to bother you, sir.
You got any l.D.?
Of course.
Sorry l was a little jumpy,
but we had a break-in earlier tonight.
We know.
We heard on the wire
your car was found in the river.
I don't suppose they found
the bastard that stole it?
- Hey, hey!
- Relax! He's a friend of mine.
Sorry about this.
Nice 'do.
He's just here to help me fix the garage.
Oliver, heel!
Now what?
Go see.
I'm so sorry, but he's a RePet.
He used to be a really good watchdog.
Now, he lets my car get stolen
and he barks at the security guards.
l hate clones.
Well, sir, we'll keep an eye on your property.
l'm gonna sleep much better
knowing you huys are around.
You try to have a good night.
- Good night.
- Take it easy.
Let's hide.
Stop it, Oliver.
Stop it.
Gee, you're glitchy today. Come on.
Good Oliver. That was a bad idea.
Let's get out of here.
Wait a minute. We can't just leave
them here with it... that thing.
Those were the guys that trying to kill me.
lt's dangerous for Natalie and Clara,
if l hang around here.
Darling, you're still awake.
l wanted to wait up for you.
Thank you.
And l wanted to spend time
with these flowers.
lt took me 17 generations to get this right.
lf you told me what you wanted,
you know, l could...
l know. Could've engineered it
in half an hour.
l'm not in that much of a hurry, Griffin.
Want to get a cup of tea,
and then go upstairs?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a good idea. Let's do that.
Okay. lt's okay.
Stay calm.
Stay very, very calm.
What a night!
That was the longest night in my life.
<i>Hello, Adam.</i>
<i>l'm a one-man Virtual Girl,</i>
<i>but if you insert the installation disk...</i>
Okay.
- What the hell was that?
- Nothing.
l felt fingers going for my zipper.
That's disgusting.
That's disgusting? l had to totally look
away when you and Natalie were...
The... You want a beer?
You saw the clone do something with Natalie,
while I took Clara into the house,
- didn't you?
- They did nothing.
- Come on. That's not what l would have done.
- What would you have done?
l would have...
Nothing.
Well, that's what they did.
You know, nothing.
Shit. ln the goddamn minivan.
ln the minivan.
I mean, you know what
tobacco does to people.
He smoked my stogie too?
The bastard.
That son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch smoked your stogie.
And she couldn't tell it wasn't me?
lt didn't look like it. l mean, she seemed...
happy.
You have no idea what it felt like
seeing her with him.
l should have just killed that son of a bitch
when I had the chance.
lt could have been worse.
It could have been someone else.
I mean, at least she's not cheating on you.
Hank!
Don't move!
Tripp!
l'm not after you.
Back away.
Back away.
Why did you do that?
Don't do anything stupid, now.
That's as far as you go.
<i>ls that you, Hank?</i>
Hank!
<i>Hey, Adam.</i>
<i>ls Hank sleeping on the floor again?</i>
<i>That's so cute.</i>
On the sixth day, God created man.
On the sixth day....
On the sixth day, God created man.
God created man on the sixth day.
Why the hell did you kill my friend?
Hank Morgan was an abomination to God.
He was a clone.
Hank was no clone.
The real Hank Morgan died this afternoon.
I know because l killed him.
So l could...
So l could kill Drucker.
Drucker is not dead.
lt would be all over the news.
Open your eyes.
Drucker's a clone.
Dr. Weir cloned Drucker.
Dr. Weir cloned your friend.
Dr. Weir cloned you.
They found us. They found us.
Shoot me in the head.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We have people at Weir's lab.
l know who they are.
If they scan my brain, they'll be killed.
Shoot me.
God forgive me.
Doesn't anyone stay dead anymore?
Who are you people?
<i>l.D. required.</i>
<i>Please, use biometric reader</i>
<i>to verify identification</i>
<i>or the alarm will sound in 10 seconds.</i>

<i>Stand by.</i>
Come on.
<i>Systems accessed.</i>
Gibson! Gibson!
<i>Select destination.</i>
You're gonna pay!
Those were brand-new boots!
<i>Dad? You're coming to my recital, right?</i>
<i>Of course. l never miss your recitals.</i>
<i>l love you.</i>
<i>You're the greatest, Dad.</i>
Unless her pseudomonas infection clears up,
l'm afraid there's nothing we can do.
What about her DNA scan?
Came up with cystic fibrosis.
Cystic fibrosis?
Which of course is impossible,
considering that it's a childhood disease,
and she would have been dead 30 years ago.
We're running the scan again.
No, l'll do it at the clinic. lf you could give us
a moment, please. Thank you very much.
Darling. Sweetheart.
We're having you transferred
to my clinic, okay?
No. l'd like to stay here.
No, l can help you at the clinic. lf you
stay here, there's nothing l can do.
l know, dear. l'll die.
Yes.
- Katherine, please.
- No.
Please, listen to me.
Katherine died 5 years ago.
The feelings that l have aren't mine.
They're hers.
Katherine, listen.
Now don't do this.
l need you so much. l need you.
l'm not afraid, Griffin.
l want to die.
My time has already passed.
My love.
What am l to do without you?
What?
You just water my flowers...
okay?
<b>Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!</b>
<i>Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies.</i>
<i>We're in the business of life.</i>
<i>Welcome to the new home of the
Weir Organ Transplant Facility,</i>
<i>here at Replacement Technologies.</i>
Excuse me, sir. l've got to check that.
Sure. Help yourself.
But... you might want to use these.
Why? What's in here?
Lower intestines. That's for Dr. Weir.
He's doing a study on the flesh-eating virus.
That's okay. You can open it up.
Just try not to breathe.
That's okay.
Go ahead, you're cleared.
Thanks.
<i>What about her DNA scan?</i>
<i>Came up with cystic fibrosis.</i>
<i>Which, of course, is impossible

<i>Dead 30 years ago.</i>
<i>So we're running a new scan.</i>
<i>No, l'll do that at my clinic, okay?</i>
<i>We've had 5 extra years
since you cloned me.</i>
<i>l treasure that.</i>
<i>- Katherine, please.
- No.</i>
<i>Please.</i>
<i>l'm not afraid.</i>
<i>l want to die.</i>
<i>My time has already passed.</i>
Can l help you?
No. l just dropped my pen.
l'm all thumbs today.
Thank you.
Will you cut that out? lt's driving me crazy.
Well, excuse me, but l nearly had
my head ripped off and it hurts like hell.
lt's only psychological.
Your neck doesn't really hurt.
Oh, yeah? And you'd know better about that?
- Yes, he would, Wiley.
- Uh-huh.
lt was your old neck that got broken.
This is your new neck. Get it?
- Give me a break. l got killed twice in two hours.
- All right, knock it off. We've all been killed before.
You know what really bothers me?
That l've never even seen a white light.
Never seen any angels. Nothing.
Give me a break.
Ma'am, l already have you logged in.
What? When?
Twenty minutes ago. According to this,
you've just entered a restricted area.
Son of a bitch has got my thumb.
Deactivate Talia, put out a security alert,
and seal off Drucker's office, now! Let's go!
Shit.
Can l help you?
Yeah.
You can stick your thumb on that.
- Thank God!
- What? More fundamentalists?
No. Adam Gibson.
We think he's in the building.
Why wasn't he taken care of already?
You've had all night.
There are four of you and one of him!
Well, two of him, but you see what l mean.
- He has a wife and kid, right?
- Yes, sir.
- Get them. We may need the leverage.
- Yes, sir.
You know, it costs me 1.2 million
each time l clone you people.
Try to be worth the money.
They'll kill you for seeing this.
They're doing their best already.
Where's Dr. Weir?
His lab's over there.
Dr. Weir.
l know about the intruder. Your office called.
Everything's under control.
lt's not under control.
You had me cloned.
Yes.
Well, you cloned the wrong man.
How did you do it? You had
to have my... what do you call it?
Your syncording. We had it. Yes.
Well, give it to me.
l want my life back.
Here. lt's your syncording.
How did you get this?
- l haven't been...
- Here.
The vision test.
Only it didn't test your vision.
lt took your syncording.
An exact picture of your mind.
And it took sample of your DNA.
And with those two things
we can clone a person in 2 hours.
We had you on file so to speak so that we could
act quickly when we were told you that were killed.
Told l was killed?
<i>Please, don't drink and drive.</i>
<i>Gibson family schedule.</i>
<i>Clara's recital at school.</i>
This is Michael Drucker's.
A syncording contains everything
in a person's memory,
and this is what Drucker saw
and heard just before he died.
You don't become one of the richest men
in the world without making enemies, so...
we back up his mind religiously.
<i>- Hey, you own the Roadrunners, right?
- Amongst other things, yeah.</i>
<i>- You a fan?
- No, l'm a big fan of both of those teams.</i>
<i>Well, I'll have to get you some tickets.</i>
<i>- Promise, right?
- Sure. I'll do it right now.</i>
<i>Sally, it's me. Yeah, remind me to get some
Roadrunner tickets for Adam Gibson.</i>
<i>He's my pilot today.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>On the sixth day, God created man.
God created man on the 6th day.</i>
<i>- No, I'm about to get on my snowboard.
- Hey, he's got a gun!</i>
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>Shit! lt's a fundamentalist.</i>
<i>He just shot them both. You call Marshall
right now. ASAP. You hear me?</i>
<i>Sally? Oh, shit.</i>
<i>No, you don't have to... Sally!</i>
<i>Help!</i>
The anti-cloning fundamentalist
killed everyone on board.
lt should have been me.
Well, we thought it was you.
Drucker even mentioned your name.
So, we used your DNA and
your syncording to clone you.
To resurrect Drucker,
we had to cover up the accident.
Keep talking.
We cloned everyone. By the time we figured
out you switched places, it was too late.
<i>Access denied. Invalid thumbprint.</i>
- They're trying to kill me.
- Because there are two Adam Gibsons.
And that's proof that
humans are being cloned,
which makes you very dangerous
to Michael Drucker.
- <i>Accessing security.</i>
- Tell me why l'm a threat to Michael Drucker.
Drucker was killed 3 years ago.
We cloned him then...
and we cloned him yesterday.
So?
lf that came out, Drucker would
be destroyed in every way.
A clone has no rights.
A clone can't own anything.
Drucker would lose all of this, everything,
because Drucker would be...
legally dead.
<i>Complete search from level 7 to level 5.</i>
Look at all the cameras you got
in this place, hmm?
You can't find one guy?
There. There.
We don't need where he's been.
We need to find where he is now.
Let's go. Hit the alarm.
- What's up?
- What area's so sensitive,
we don't allow cameras?
Drucker will do anything,
anything to destroy the evidence.
And you're the evidence.
This is evidence too.
Move, move! Clear the way!
Let's go.
- l have to go to the bathroom.
- Okay, Clara.
Anyone else need to go to the bathroom?
Why do you think l'm telling you all this?
It's because l can do nothing to stop
what they're trying to do to you.
- There! There he is!
- Zone 6. Engineering corridor.
Move, move! Clear the way!
Or what they might be trying
to do to your family.
What about my family?
Drucker has to kill one of you.
lf he can't kill you, he'll go for the other one.
And your family could get killed
in the process.
Get out!
<i>Destination "Get out" not understood.</i>
<i>Morgan Randall Elementary School.</i>
l'm very sorry, sir.
Daddy!
She's supposed to be up there now, right?
This is the....
That's odd.
l'm just gonna go check and
make sure everything's okay.
- Okay?
- All right.
- Excuse me.
- Of course.
Clara?
Oh, my God.
Mommy!
Mommy, l'm scared.
l'm here. l got you. I got you.
Could you help us, please?
What are you doing?
You see this? It's the only thing keeping
the dogs from tearing her apart.
So be quiet and come with us.
No!
Let's go!
- Daddy!
- Move it!
Natalie!
No.
<i>You have reached 911 police emergency.</i>
- <i>Your call is important to us.</i>
- Yeah, l know.
<i>Your "yes" or "no" answers will help us
in directing police services to assist you.</i>
Come on!
- <i>Are you reporting a felony?</i>
- Yes.
- <i>Thank you for reporting a felony.</i>
- Come on!
<i>ls the felony in progress now?</i>
Yes!
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>ls there a current danger of bodily harm
to you or others?</i>
Yes!
<i>Are suspects or injured victims currently...</i>
Forget about talking to the police.
l tried that already.
Who the hell are you?
l know this sounds insane, but...
- l'm Adam Gibson.
- What?
We don't have time for you to be shocked
right now, because they got Natalie and Clara.
- l need your help to get my family back.
- They are my family.
That's for sleeping with my wife
in the damn minivan.
<i>Your report has been tomed-out
or cancelled at your request.</i>
Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies.
lt's him.
Mr. Gibson, l believe
you have something of mine.
<i>Oh, no. I have everything of yours.</i>
<i>I have the syncording that proves
that you are a clone.</i>
l have everything of yours.
Your family in the palm of my hand.
- Shall we trade?
- <i>You read my mind.</i>
Just the highlights.
<i>All right. I'll bring the disk</i>
<i>to the Double X Charter office
at 10 o'clock tonight.</i>
<i>Be there with my family.</i>
Did you have to hit me that hard?
l had to stop you from talking to the police.
That's a good one.
That should do it.
What are you doing?
Testing it. Because l don't think
you have enough aluminum in there.
Are you kidding me? That's exactly the same
amount l used in the Rain Forest War.
You shouldn't be talking.
The mess you left trying to fix your garage...
- You saw me working in the garage?
- Saw you?
l nearly shot you.
Let's try it.
- Cool.
- Cool.
You better be miles away
when this thing goes off.
l'm more worried about getting us
into the building to find Natalie and Clara.
l'll take my chances getting out.
Griffin.
Here.
- What are you doing?
- Yours. Yours.
Griffin, what's the matter?
My wife, Katherine, is dead.
Jesus Christ.
Griffin, l don't know...
l'm so sorry.
- Don't start with "sorry" with me.
- I'm so sorry.
Don't start! Don't start!
Don't start with "sorry"!
Now, l know about the congenital defects
you've been imbedding into the clone DNA.
There's my wife, Johnny Phoenix
and the others, but...
Michael, why my wife? Why?
You're right, Griffin.
lt's a security protocol l implemented.
And I didn't tell you about it,
because l knew you wouldn't understand.
What should l understand?
The only thing l understand is that...
you gave my wife cystic fibrosis!
Griffin, calm down.
Someone made a mistake, all right?
This was never meant to hurt Katherine.
- lt didn't hurt her, it just killed her.
- Listen to me.
Suppose we clone a senator who's agreed
to support us, but he goes back on his word.
- What's the point? What's the point?
- Or Johnny Phoenix wants to double his salary.
By giving them shorter life spans,
- we guaranty our leverage.
- What's the point?
The point is, if they betray us, they're dead.
lf they stay on the team, we clone
them again, and no harm done.
And that's exactly what
we're gonna do with Katherine.
l'm sure she's being cloned as we speak.
No, she's not.
- She's--
- No.
Griffin, it was a mistake.
lf you're concerned about her DNA,
go through it yourself, make sure it's clean.
And obviously there won't be
any charge for the cloning.
No charge. Thank you very much.
What you don't understand is
she does not want to be cloned.
So, do it anyway.
Do it anyway. l see.
Let me explain something to you.
It's very simple.
l loved my wife very much.
So much so that l promised
l would never bring her back again.
And l won't.
And if l can't bring her back again,
l'll never bring back anyone, ever again.
That's how much l loved her.
So, it's over, it's finished,
and l quit.
Well, l can't let you quit.
Yeah, well, l've looked the other way too often.
l've justified too much, so...
l'm finished. lt's over.
- You know what l'm gonna do for you, Griffin?
- What are you gonna to do for me?
l'm gonna give you...
the greatest gift that you can possibly imagine.
- A gift?
- l'm gonna save your life.
l'm gonna save Katherine's life.
l'm gonna save our friendship.
And l'm gonna save your marriage.
Michael, what are you talking about?
l'm gonna kill you now,
and l'm going to clone you
using your latest syncording.
Then l'm gonna clone Katherine
using her last syncording.
You understand?
Do you see what l'm doing for you?
You and Katherine will be back together,
and neither one of you will remember
that you ever promised not to clone her.
Or that she even died.
And obviously you won't remember
this conversation.
You're welcome.
<i>All right, now show me my family.</i>
Bastards. l knew it.
<i>Your syncording isn't here and neither is he.</i>
lt was being flown by remote or something.
Both of you, get back here now.
Come on.
This is a private pad.
You can't land that here.
- Replacement Technologies only.
- l'm here to pick up Mr. Drucker.
Here.
lt's my charter contract.
Okay.
Everything's normal, Mr. Drucker,
but we'll stay alert.
What time are you planning to take off?
<i>Take off? No, l didn't order--</i>
<i>Your pilot's on his way down to reception.</i>
Now you listen to me.
<i>Seal the building. Full security alert.</i>
<i>You find this pilot.
He is armed and very dangerous.</i>
<i>And get Wiley and some men
up to my office now.</i>
- Freeze the elevators ans shut down...
- Okay.
- ...level 2 and 3 parking garages.
- Over there, on monitor 12.
- Yeah, zone 6, engineering corridor.
- There, sector 3.
He's headed right towards you, Dan.
Turn around! Turn around!
Don't even try it.
Get some people up that west stairwell!
Teams 3 and 4, close off on him! Let's go!
- He must have shot out a power box.
- He's trashing the whole security system.
All right. We got him trapped.
West stairwell between 13 and 14.
Let's go!
Cover the stairwell doors!
Fire in front of him!
Okay!
You did pretty good!
Totally fooled us at the airport!
You managed to turn this place into shambles!
<i>You're the greatest, Dad!</i>
Adam, Mr. Drucker would like to talk to you.
And, of course, we do have your family!
All right.
Go get him. Go get him. Go.
Well, well.
- Adam Gibson.
- l wish l could say, "the one and only".
Looks like we both went back
on our word, didn't we?
You might find we have more
in common than you thought.
Where is my family?
Right to business.
An admirable trait.
There they are. All safe and sound.
For the moment.
And your syncording is not on him.
It's not in his whisper craft.
l knew you'd double-cross me,
so l gave it to my clone.
If anything happens to me or my family,
the next time you will see your syncording,
will be at your murder trial.
Dr. Weir didn't tell you, didn't he?
Tell me what?
Adam, Adam, Adam.
He's not the clone.
You are.
I want you to ask yourself something.
Do you remember anything
after being scanned by my bodyguard?
<i>Now, I need to check your vision.
Place your chin here. Look straight ahead.</i>
Do you actually remember
changing places with your friend?
<i>Hey, buddy, wake up. We're here.
Woodland Mall.</i>
You know, the salesman
at the RePet shop thought...
it was odd that you came in twice.
Asked the same questions...
twice.
<i>Still can't make up your mind, huh?</i>
<i>You lost a dog, right?</i>
<i>Let me see your chin.</i>
<i>You cut yourself shaving, right?</i>
Your shaving cut?
Easily reproduced.
So is the scar from your old war wound.
l know who l am.
l know you do.
Talia?
How many times have you been cloned?
l've lost count.
There's one way to tell.
Show him.
lt's the only way to keep track
what generation a clone is.
See? Four dots means
she's been cloned four times.
Come on.
Let's take a look at yours.
Come, take a look in the mirror.
Let's find out if you are who you think you are.
Just under your left eye.
Kind of takes the fun
out of being alive, doesn't it?
So, you see...
your family is not really your family.
They're his.
And you, my friend, are in exactly
the same boat as all of us.
lf Adam Gibson gets that syncording
to the authorities,
we will all be destroyed.
lf you really love your wife and kid,
you'll tell me where Adam Gibson is.
We'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.
You'll tell me where Adam Gibson is.
We'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.
They'll never have to know
that you're the clone.
It's that or lose them forever.
You know, Adam, l'm not making
this offer, because l have to.
l can get everything I need
from your memories.
The fact is, l'd like you to understand,
you'd also be serving a higher purpose.
ln two years, three tops, l will control
enough votes to get the laws changed.
And then we won't have to lose our best people.
We won't have to lose our Mozarts.
We won't have to lose our Martin Luther Kings.
We will finally be able to conquer death.
We will finally be able to conquer death.
And who gets to decide
who lives and who dies?
You?
You have a better idea?
Yeah.
What about God?
You're one of those. l suppose
you think science is inherently evil.
No, l don't think science is inherently evil.
But l think you are.
lf you believe that God created man
in his own image,
then you also believe that God gave man
the power to understand evolution,
to exploit science,
to manipulate the genetic code,
to do exactly what l'm doing.
l'm just taking over where God left off.
lf you really believe that,
then you should clone yourself,
while you're still alive.
Why's that? So l can understand
you and your unique perspective?
No. So you can go fuck yourself.
Now you're gonna tell us where you put
Mr. Drucker's syncording!
You won't find it in my head.
l told him to hide it,
so l wouldn't know where it is.
- We'll see about that, won't we?
- Yeah, we will.
Let's go. Get in here.
Come on!
Fine! Have it your way!
That didn't hurt so bad.
Asshole.
Let's go back a few minutes.
<i>Here is Drucker's syncording.</i>
There he is. There's the other one.
<i>Keep this and wait here for me.</i>
<i>lf l'm not back in an hour,
you know what to do.</i>
<i>Don't worry. If anything happens
to you or my family,</i>
<i>l'm gonna destroy that son of a bitch.</i>
You got the location?
The airport. l was just there.
He'll be dead in 20 minutes.
Let's go.
Betrayed by your own mind.
Wait! Wait!
What?
They staged that scene for our benefit.
The other one was sitting behind him,
so we couldn't see him. Look!
The bastard faked his own syncording.
The other one was hidding
in the whisper craft,
and this one deleberately
avoided looking at him,
so he wouldn't be in his visual memory.
You mean the other one's in this building too?
Yes, Marshall, that's correct.
Now warn Vincent. Put out another alert.
This one is the diversion.
He smashes all the cameras,
as he gets himself captured,
meanwhile, the other one is free to just
stroll in here and take his wife and kid.
ldiot!
- Natalie, Clara.
- Daddy!
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Daddy?
- Don't worry, sir. Get him up.
- Shit.
l'm scared, Dad.
What's going on?
- This isn't because of the cigar, is it?
- No, this is not because of the cigar.
- l'll explain to you later.
- Dad, I'm scared.
Don't worry. He's not going anywhere, sir.
We'll get him. Let's go!
Wait!
Talia, you go. You two stay here.
Have them block all the exits.
Yeah, Henderson, come in.
Seal off the entire tank area, levels 6 and 7.
l'm trying, sir. Give me a minute.
And get us some power up here.
Don't move.
My daughter is right inside that door.
l don't want to expose her
to any graphic violence.
She already gets enough of that
from the media.
Put your weapons down.
Nice and easy. Good.
Now, when you go inside, you say...
- Have a nice flight.
- Have a nice flight, little girl.
Friends of Daddy's.
All right, let's go.
We'll have a little midnight flight
with Daddy and Mommy.
There we are.
All right?
There you go, sir.
Wiley.
Go.
Wiley, just wait one second.
Not again!
Don't bring him back.
Stupid bastard blew a hole
through my stomach.
l'll be dead in 20 minutes, tops.
But what better place, right?
Henderson? Where's my power?
Realys are coming online now, sir.
<i>Get all exits blocked. All exits!</i>
Shit.
Go start warming up a blank.
Then do a fresh syncording.
l want my mind up-to-the-minute.
Okay. Here it is. This is a fresh one.
This will be a complete syncording.
- ls that Talia?
- Shit.
Go help her.
We'll find them.
- What have you got?
- Tanks 3 and 4, nothing.
Okay, go. Take the back walk.
No.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
- Take her to your mother's.
- I got her.
And stay there until l pick you up, okay?
Come with us, Daddy.
l have to help a friend, okay? Bye.
l love you.
Wiley, you shot me!
Oh, right. That was you.
l got to get dressed.
You're not even going to wait till...
l die?
Would you?
Come on.
Get it off!
You got blood on the jacket. Jesus Christ.
What?
What?
What?
Look...
Adam, we can make a deal.
You have absolutely no reason to kill me.
l didn't do anything to you. lt was all him.
Listen to me.
l can rebuild all of this in a very short time.
l can still save you, Adam.
Save me?
We put congenital defects into the clone
DNA to give the clones short life spans.
You wanna know what you're gonna die of?
How long you've got to live?
We can go right upstairs,
right now, and look it up.
We all have to die someday.
We don't have to die.
l'm offering you the chance
to live forever. Never aging.
Perfect in every way.
Perfect? Like you?
Look.
Here is your perfection.
Oh, God.
There's no need to panic. l can fix this.
No, you won't fix anything.
lt's over. lt's finished.
lt's finished.
When l said you should screw yourself,
l didn't mean for you to take it literally.
Go after him.
Get him.
Check the roof!
You! Up top!
Come on!
- Can you fly this?
- Better than you can.
Good. Because your shooting sucks.
Let's get out of here.
Shit.
Come on!
Come on!
Try to climb over me.
Come on, hurry up!
Come on!
Shit!
You know, l keep wondering.
Am l really human?
Do l have a soul?
Well, your DNA scan came back normal,
didn't it?
Yeah. Zero defects.
Just like a RePet commercial.
lf you're not human, don't you think
they would have mentioned it?
All right, enough philosophy.
l better get going.
l've got 3 weeks at sea to figure all that out.
You have to hurry if you want to see Clara.
Thanks for letting me say goodbye
to your family.
Now, wait.
This is your family too.
You were willing to die to save them.
Now, you might think about that
while you're at there at sea
wondering if you're really human or not.
Because if that's not being human,
l don't know what is.
Thanks.
Hello, everybody.
- Look what l brought.
- A kitty!
Oh, Sadie.
l thought that...
- Hank's cat was a--
- She is.
But you hate RePets.
Well, l changed my mind.
You old softie.
Can we keep her?
- Please? Please?
- Of course.
That's why l brought her home.
Put her down.
Good.
Thank you so much.
