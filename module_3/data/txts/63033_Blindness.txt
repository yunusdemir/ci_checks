Come on!
Come on!
It's a green light!
Come on! Move it!
Sir? Open your window, sir.
Okay! Okay!
Wait a minute!
- Sir? Sir?
- I'm blind.
- Open the window, please!
- I'm blind.
Stay calm. Stay where you are,
and tell me, what happened?
I'm blind! I'm blind!
It's like something's flooding
my eyes. I didn't do anything.
Right. It's probably nerves.
- Should someone call an ambulance?
- Please...
...just take me my apartment.
- Just wait a minute!
- And my wife can help me.
- I can take him.
I can drive him home.
- Are you sure, sir?
- Yes. Of course.
We got to get him off the street.
Okay.
Okay, sir.
I'll take you to the other side.
It's just a blind guy.
Careful. Take care of him.
Watch him. He can't see.
He's blind.
He's blind.
Here you go.
Give me your hand.
Watch your head, please.
Easy. Easy.
Okay. So, you can hear me, right?
- Yeah. Right.
- So say something if you need it.
And we'll have you home in no time.
Okay? Any questions?
Why aren't we moving?
It's a red light.
There's a movement to it.
Like light particles.
Like light shining
through a sea of white.
- It feels like I'm swimming in milk.
- Really? Well...
one good thing is I've never heard
blindness described as white.
It's black, right?
It's the absence of light.
- So, that's a good thing.
- I guess.
Yeah, sure it is.
It means it's not real blindness.
Anyway, it's too fast.
Blindness is slow, right?
What you have is psychosomatic.
Some kind of nervous thing.
Just a second here.
Is this where we're going?
Okay, so... Why don't
you just get out here.
- Walk to the curb.
- All right.
- I got it.
- Walk to your left. Straight at.
Hey! Hey! Look!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Don't worry.
I got you.
- You okay?
- Yeah. Oh, my God!
This your building?
It's nice.
He's blind.
Can't see.
Just put your hand... Be careful!
Remember stairs, right?
What floor? I got it.
I got it.
- 14th.
- So. What are your problems?
- Sorry?
- What are you worried about?
- Nothing unusual.
- No? Any other symptoms?
- No?
- Like nervous symptoms?
No, my life is pretty regular
these days.
Not a care in the world?
Life of leisure, huh?
Here we go. Is anyone going to be at
home, or are you going to be alone?
Honey, I'm home.
Honey, I'm home.
- Thank you for everything.
- Nice place.
Did your wife design it here?
No. Listen. Thank you for
everything. I'm so fine for now.
Do you want me to stay and take care
of you until your wife gets home?
- No, no, no. I'm fine.
- Sure? It would make me feel better.
I'm fine. Thank you.
- You sure?
- I'm sure.
- You want me to stay?
- No, thank you.
- All right.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Wonderful!
I liked it so much.
Look at this.
You couldn't have cleaned
it up before you lay down?
Are you even listening?
I'm not your maid.
You're bleeding.
Are you okay?
I'm blind.
Eye doctors, eye doctors...
Do you know any?
Let's just go to the hospital.
No way, they'll keep
us waiting for hours.
We're going to a specialist.
I'd rather die than stay like this.
Shut up!
You're confusing me.
My apologies.
- Honey?
- What?
- So?
- So, what?
Can you see anything?
Anything at all?
- I see nothing.
- Try harder.
- What?
- Where are the car keys?
Take your keys.
You can look for mine later.
Taxi!
Are you sure you
looked everywhere?
Sure. There's nothing
wrong with my eyes.
What kind of a person
steals from a blind man?
He should go blind.
You can come with me now, sir.
The doctor will see you in a minute.
- Excuse me.
- Oh, God!
But I've been waiting here
for over an hour with a child.
Sorry, doctor's orders.
Yeah, but my appointment was at six.
It's now seven o'clock.
- We'll get to you as soon as we can.
- And it's not...
Miss. Miss... Let him go.
He's worse off than we are.
This is totally disrespectable.
Nothing. Nothing in your lenses.
Nothing in the retina.
Somebody just turned
out the lights?
No, it's more like all the
lights were turned on.
Your eyes look perfect.
You see, I told you.
Except I cannot see anything.
Yes, and if this is true then we're
going to run some more tests.
Unfortunately we're not going
to be able to do that today.
What do you mean, if it's true?
- You think I'm lying?
- No, not at all.
But I've to be honest. I've never
experienced anything like this.
So, is that a prescription?
No, I'm actually writing
directions for the hospital.
I know how to get to the hospital.
I don't need directions.
They're not for you.
They're for the staff.
So they know what to do with
your husband when he arrives.
- So that's it?
- That's it for now.
It's going to be okay.
We're going to find out what it is.
There's nothing else
we can do right now.
And I'll just need a
signature right there.
- Okay.
- I'm sorry. Not you, him.
Me?
- Parking stamp?
- We don't have a car.
Shit.
What you doing?
The road's closed!
What was that?
Fuck!
That's stupid.
Stupid.
Alright, we're gonna do this guy.
Remember this guy, the crab?
Alright, we're gonna
test this eye first.
- Do you prefer this lens or this?
- The other one.
- This one? You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.
All right, put your glasses on.
This is for you.
Show your mom.
Good boy.
I'm going to ask you to take the
drops for at least five days.
And maybe, should I keep
wearing the glasses.
Would you like me to
order you to wear them?
Okay. I order you to wear
your sunglasses.
Unless you're bathing or sleeping.
All right, I'll give
you a try tomorrow.
I just wanted to get your take on
a bizarre case I saw today. Okay.
So,it appeared to be a kind of,
"amaurosis", which is a...
...which is a kind of a...
- Sorry.
Are you done? Sure do you
want to hear this or no?
Except with an ''amaurosis''
everything goes dark...
and with him everything was white.
- Well, how do you know what he saw?
- Exactly, I don't know...
what he saw, but I guess I have
to take his word for it, don't I?
It could be something
neurological, like...
something we call ''agnosia''...
which is an inability to
recognize familiar objects.
- ''Agnosia?''
- That's right.
It's as if a man sees, I don't know,
a fork, he looks at it he says:
''What is this thing? I've never
seen anything like this before.''
Is that related to ''agnosticism''?
In what way?
You know, ''Agnosia'', ''Agnosticism''.
- Etymologically speaking?
- Yeah. Didn't you take Latin?
It's actually Greek, dear.
Well, I bet it has something to do
with ignorance, or lack of belief.
There's a lot of
judgment in that word.
Never mind.
Never mind.
You want some more wine?
- No, but are you sure you do?
- Yeah!
- I'm going to bed.
- Okay.
Wait, hold on, hold on.
What was I gonna ask you?
- What was I gonna say? How are you?
- Something about dinner?
No.
- Diseases?
- No. That's a nice sweater.
Thanks. I can't help you,
sweetheart. Sorry.
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.
I'm sorry. I'm a little distracted.
I know. I know. I'm sorry.
Could you set the alarm
back for half an hour?
I need to make a couple
calls in the morning.
- Yeah, of course. Good night.
- Good night.
- Thank you for the tart.
- It was Tiramisu.
Yeah, Tiramisu.
Well, well.
What's the big secret?
- What are you hiding from?
- Jerks like you.
That'll be 11 even.
Thank you.
Taxi!
Hi. Hotel Emiliano, please.
Do you have the time?
Yeah, you still have 20 minutes.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Your guy said you might be late.
You're pretty. Nice to meet you.
I can't take my glasses off.
ls that a problem?
- Are you serious?
- Doctor's orders.
- Really?
- I can call another girl.
Fuck!
That was wild.
I mean it. Really weird.
I still see everythingwhite.
- Just ring the bell.
- I've been ringing the bell.
- Can I help you?
- This man says he's your husband.
- He can't see.
- I don't care what he's done!
- You can just turn around...
- Just open the fucking door!
Officer, I don't know this man!
- Forget he's a cop! Let me in!
- All right.
Get out! Fucker!
- Thanks a lot!
- Nice and easy.
Come on, come on, let's go!
I'll get you some help.
- I can't see!
- Wait here! I'll get you some help!
- Just wait right here!
- You don't understand? I can't see!
- Shit!
- Oh, Jesus!
I need security at 18,
right away!
- Hi!
- Hi! What...?
- I'm gonna grab your purse.
- Yeah. It's okay.
- Where's your clothes?
- Jesus Christ!
- Everything's going to be all right.
- I know her.
- Don't push me!
- Everything's going to be...
- Shut the hell up!
- Take your hands off me!
- Where's my dress?
- Your dress is just here.
I need to call my parents.
- You're up before the alarm.
- Yes.
- Good morning.
- I doubt it's going to be that good.
What's the matter?
I... I can't see.
- What?
- That patient I saw yesterday...
must have infected me.
That's... that's impossible.
Let... let me look. Here.
I don't... I don't see anything.
Nobody goes blind like that.
Well, there's at least
two of us now.
Oh, no! No, go out! Oh, God, no!
You touched! No, I'm...
- It's infectious!
- No, no, no!
I'm telling you!
It's infectious!
He gave it to me!
It's contagious!
I'm not gonna get sick.
I promise. I promise.
Jesus! I spent the
night in bed with you!
It's all right. We'll take care of it.
It's all right.
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.
- What time is it?
- It's almost 8h3O.
Okay, let's call the hospital.
With no visible signs of trauma.
No extenuating symptoms.
- I'm not barricade the streets.
- There you go. Here you are.
All right, I'll see you soon.
No problem.
That's a risk I can take.
All right.
- What seems to be the problem?
- It's a boy, he's blind.
Hey, sport! It's okay.
Everything is fine.
Don't be nervous.
Somebody,help!
I can't see!
Ministry of Health.
It's a little bit early.
I would suggest that you call
sometime after nine. Yes nine.
Morning, Minister.
Some strange calls this morning.
Thank you.
God! He was here at six I think.
Or, six thirty.
Who else was here? The waiting
room was crowded, I remember.
- Ma'am.
- Excuse me.
I've all the contact numbers here.
Do you want me to...
Ma'am. I'm gonna have to
ask you to close up shop...
and come with us as
quickly as possible.
May I have those files, please?
They're going to be
here any minute.
I know. That's why
I want you to relax.
I'll take care of everything
we may come across.
Okay, I'll be fine.
If I need anything, I'll have them
call you. Or I'll call you myself.
They can't keep us apart
for too long. Can they?
- Are you coming?
- I'm right behind you.
- Don't lock yourself out now.
- Don't worry, I've got the keys.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.
Please, approach the vehicle.
- Do you have a cell phone, sir?
- Yes.
Put it in the bag, please.
- What for?
- Thank you. This way.
- I got it, thank you.
- This way.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
No, no, step down, ma'am.
I'm asking you to step down!
- No, I'm gonna go.
- My orders are only to take the man.
This vehicle is for infected, okay?
Well, then you'll have to take me,
because I've just gone blind.
Fine, have it your way.
Jesus!
Attention! Attention!
The Government regrets having been
forced to exercise with urgency...
what it considers to be it's duty to
protect the population by all means.
We are in a state of crisis.
An epidemic of blindness...
provisionally known as the
"White Sickness"we're relying...
on the public spirit and
cooperation of all citizens...
to stem any future contagion.
The decision to temporarily
quarantine all those infected...
was not taken without
careful consideration.
Be assured that the isolation
in which you find yourselves...
represents,above any
personal considerations...
an act of solidarity with
the rest of the Nation.
You'll never believe
where they brought us.
Let me guess, this guy's voice
is already driving me crazy.
You're lucky you can't see it.
It's a video?
Well, that's scary.
Makes you question what
kind of an idiot...
would play a video in a
quarantine for the blind.
Each ward is equipped with
a phone forcommunication...
- Here.
- ...with the outside.
The phone is for
emergency purposes only.
We've got to get you out of here.
I'm gonna tell them you can see.
No. They'll never believe it. You'd
never get near enough to tell them.
I want you to go home.
Please, go home.
I know you think you
have to say that, but I'm fine!
- It's what I want.
- Really? All right.
- I want it.
- All right.
Anyway, it's too late now.
- We shouldn't tell that I can see.
- You're right.
With that spirit of
cooperation in mind...
we ask everyone pay attention to
the following simple instructions.
- Are you with me?
- Echo!
Number One: Each patient
shall choose his own bed.
- It's a corridor.
- Number Two:
Each ward shall elect a captain,
or"ward representative"...
forcommunication with
the outside world...
Four? Three?
Row two, Number Three.
Five.
- Doctor, how many wards are there?
- Yes, sorry.
There's two other wards
on this floor...
and then another ward
on the lower floor...
...for people who...
- How do you know that?
We explored a little
before you came in.
We chose this ward because
it's closest to the entrance...
...where the food comes in.
- Well, someone's thinking.
That's the asshole who's
responsible for all this.
If I had my fucking eyes,
I'd kill him.
He's responsible for
stealing my car.
- What? Are you serious?
- Damn yeah!
If I hadn't been decent
and stopped to help you...
I'm gonna go to another room...
as far away as possible
from this son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch who can
steal from a blind man...
- Honey, honey, they're fighting!
- They are fighting?
Stop it now!
Stop that!
- Stop this!
- Over here.
- Stop this!
- Here.
Stop! Stop, you're
acting like children!
Stop it, please!
We're obviously all alone here.
Okay? We're on our own!
So, if you want to make
this place a hell...
you're going upon it in
absolutely the right way.
- He stole my car.
- It doesn't matter.
What are you gonna do with a car?
You can't drive anyway.
- He stole my sight!
- Okay, stop that now.
Look, Doc, or whoever
the fuck you are!
We're all equal here, right?
There's been no proper election.
So don't start ordering people
around with that tone of voice.
I am not ordering anybody,
I'm simply asking you to...
I'm simply asking you
to leave this man alone.
Okay. Fine.
Just be aware that I don't
respond well to that voice...
of authority.
What I do respond to,
in case you're wondering...
is flattery, and people
sucking up to me.
Everyone close your eyes, ladies.
I'm gonna take off my clothes now...
and try out this bed here.
Number Three.
Are you okay? If you need anything
in the night, I'm right here.
I gotta go pee.
Doorway.
So try to remember the route.
How many doors.
How many steps.
I counted them when
I first got here.
- And straight.
- And straight.
Stop it.
Doorway. Doorway.
Right turn.
- I think.
- Right turn.
Straight.
Another doorway.
- Jesus!
- What happened?
What are you wearing
for shoes, bitch?
Where's the wound?
- Here?
- Fuck!
- We need to clean it up.
- Crazy bitch stuck her heel in me.
I tripped.
And watch your mouth.
- I gotta go pee!
- Just hold it a little while.
Everyone, stay put.
We'll be right back. Okay, okay.
I really gotta go pee!
Jesus! A piece of skin,
or something.
I found some dishtowels,
but I don't know if they're clean.
Okay. Keep pressure on it.
- It's too dirty, I think.
- It's really bleeding.
What are you wearing?
Give me your shirt. Quickly.
Thank God we have a real
doctor here. Seriously.
- I was only fooling around.
- Relax, relax.
- Here, here. Let me...
- Careful!
Let me do it.
Let me do it.
Careful with that.
It's expensive.
Expensive shirt of mine.
Once...
twice...
three times.
All right.
- That's fine.
- That's good.
I'm afraid it's gonna be infected.
Doesn't surprise me. The filth
from the street on that shoe.
What time is it?
1h3O.
You can't be responsible for everyone.
You need to sleep.
- Are you afraid to close your eyes?
- No. I'm afraid to open them.
Afraid I'll go blind in my sleep.
I'm gonna take a walk.
Opening the gate.
Pull right up to the door.
Closing the gate.
Locking up.
Only the infected are
permitted within these doors.
Once inside, follow the corridor
until the wards. Alright,let's go.
Four, three, two, one.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Hello? Hello, can anyone
hear us? Door. Door?
Hello? Hello?
Honey, wake up.
- What?
- New people.
- How many?
-  Not... not many.
- Do you have beds available in here?
- Yeah. We should.
- How many of you are there?
- We don't know.
- We don't know
- Okay.
Maybe you could count off. One by
one, and introduce yourselves.
I'm Number One.
I'm a police officer.
I'm Number Two.
I'm a taxi driver.
Number Three.
A pharmacist assistant.
Four.
I'm a hotel maid.
Five.
Financial advisor.
That's my wife!
That's my wife!
- Honey?
- It's me.
Honey?
- Where are you?
- Here.
Where are you?
Here.
Say something.
Here.
- Keep talking.
- Here.
That's great!
- Is my mom here?
- She'll be here, don't worry. Okay?
Get off!
That's them. I wanna catch them.
Quickly.
- It's occupied. Move on.
- We'll be right back!
- And who was that guy talking?
- Is our ward representative, right?
Please!
- Let's go!
- Please! Stop!
- Stop!
- Stop!
- Please wait!
- Excuse me!
- Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm sorry. You gotta to get back.
- Excuse me. Listen.
We have a man here
with a injured leg...
and he needs serious
medical attention.
He has an infection, he needs
antibiotics, I'm a doctor.
I can't let you leave.
So, please, turn back.
Okay. I'm not asking to leave. I'm
simply trying to ask for help here.
Get the fuck back!
Another step and I'm gonna shoot.
- Honey...
- This is ridiculous.
- I have a sick man here.
- This isn't gonna work.
I'm gonna count to three and
if you don't turn back...
I'm going to shoot you!
Can you talk to your superior,
please?
- One!
- You got to be kidding me.
- Two!
- This is... this is insanity!
Will you talk to your supervisors?
- This is not going to work!
- Three! I'm gonna fucking shoot you!
Let's go!
- This is ridiculous!
- Just forget it. They're not...
I can't believe this is happening.
Stop.
Each ward is equipped
with a phone...
forcommunication
with the outside...
the phone is for
emergency purposes only.
Take. Try it.
- This is great.
- Is there any coffee here?
Is there any extra food
at the end there?
I don't have.
I don't...
The other table needs more.
I think I have one extra fruit cup.
- Any want the meat pack?
- The other table can have some?
Does anybody have a knife?
- A knife?
- Or a fork?
I have a knife.
- Do you want to borrow mine?
- I'll wait, what about you?
- We can share.
- No problem.
I'm still curious about what
happened to that girl, though.
There was this girl, in 18O6.
Screaming. Naked,
except for these sunglasses.
- Naked?
- She'd gone blind?
Yeah. She was the one
that infected me.
- Is it good your fruit?
- Yeah.
Yes, I'll Ieave a message.
My message is: Why is there
an emergency number...
if there's no one
there to answer it?
We have a situation
here in the blind ward.
Apparently you missed that,
because we don't have enough food.
Also, there's still my request from
yesterday for an medical supply kit.
I hope you get this
message before dinner.
Six more coming!
Number Five:
Security guard at a hotel.
Number Six: Engineer.
I'm a receptionist at
an ophthalmologist.
I know your voice.
- Oh, my God, where are you?
- Here. Here.
I'm 7, I forgot to say 7.
Are you all right?
I've got you. All right?
Door. Left, left, make a left.
And straight. Straight.
Keep going.
- Do you need a hand?
- No. I got it. That's it.
First of all,
welcome to the newcomers.
We're Ward One.
There's a few things
I want to discuss.
We've a guide line that connects
all the wards to each other.
It's an innovation made by my wife.
We can thank her for that.
There's another point. The toilets.
They're absolutely disgusting.
I'm going to need a team to go
and see what's going on in there.
I like the warm feeling on my face.
The smell too.
You used to like it...
Remember that New Year's
when we went to the Shrine?
There were so many people
waiting in line.
It was cold.
The ceremonial fire
was near the line.
When we got close to it...
our bodies were
warmed on one side...
It felt good!
We didn't even know
each other that well.
And so...
I don't want to listen.
I don't want to listen.
Why?
I can't pretend.
There's no...
there's no soap.
I guess it's better than nothing.
- You hear that?
- What?
- Any bed in here?
- There's not.
Hello.
Hello.
Would you happen to have
an extra bed in your dorm?
I have a radio.
There's not as many
stations as there used to be.
But I guess, if you insist...
I can give you an update.
- At least we save on the batteries.
- Please.
In the first 24 hours there
were hundreds of cases...
or so, the rumor says.
All the same. No pain.
A sea of white.
The Government's response,
as you know, was decisive.
The first of the
make shift quarantines.
But this decommissioned sanitarium
didn't make ideal public relations.
Let's organize a massive
international medical conference...
of ophthalmologists
and neurologists.
We don't yet know if this is...
And so for days and days...
the helpless viewing public
was subjected to seminars...
and endless roundtables...
with specialists
from around the world...
proclaiming their general ignorance.
...that was published in ''Infectious
Disease International''...
How premature it was
to talk of cures.
How more research was needed,
and more funding.
A point that was at least
once dramatically illustrated.
Oh, my God!
I've gone blind! Oh, my God!
Help me! Help me!
Help me! Someone, please!
Somebody!
- Shit! Shit! No, no, no!
- Take him out of here!
Weeks passed,and with time,
and the constant coverage...
the city was bored back to work.
Oblivious to the evidence
all around them...
that the disease was
immune to bureaucracy.
- No! No!
- Ma'am, stop. Stop struggle, please.
What about the roads and traffic?
Chaos, as usual.
But then reports came of a
bus crash with 23 casualties.
That same day, two planes collided.
No one could say if the disease
was the cause of the accidents.
But people were terrified.
And eitherthe panic
spread the blindness.
Orthe blindness spread the panic.
Casualties multiplied.
People decided to stay home.
And the traffic
problems were solved.
My fellow citizens,
friends,supporters.
Like so many of you,
I have gone blind.
Maybe... maybe we need
some music after all.
Leave it there.
And forthe length of the song...
the "Kingdom of the Blind"shrank
to the circle of an AM radio.
One can only imagine
the inclined heads...
the wide eyes, the tears.
Why do they ask were they
tears of joy or sorrow?
Joy and sorrow are not
like oil and water.
They coexist.
Ladies and gentleman,
I need you to follow my voice.
Come towards my voice, and as
you do, please, watch your step.
- Right ahead.
- Why is I warned you?
For follow some one.
- Do not push!
- Put it to the right.
Number 12: Anyone attempting leave
the premises will be corrected.
Hello? Excuse me! Sir?
Can we have some guidance,
please? Sir?
- Stay in line.
- Please?
- Stay in line, little man.
- Hello? Excuse me, sir?
Some one?
- We need some guidance, please.
- Stay in line.
Fuck!
Attention. The shovel you requested
is waiting in the yard.
Choose one person to
come and collect it.
One person.
Where is it?
Straight ahead. Just come.
Come this way.
Okay. Good.
You're fine.
Next one's the ground.
That's okay.
Okay, keep coming. Warmer. Warmer.
Keep coming.
Oh, colder. Stop.
Okay.
Turn to your right.
Good.
Now, keep going forward.
Okay. Warmer.
Warmer, colder. Stop.
Now, turn right again.
Yeah. That's it.
Okay. Good.
Very good.
Now keep going forward.
Go forward.
Good, warmer, colder, colder.
Stop, stop, stop.
Colder! Colder!
Did you see that, Sarge?
Did you see that?
The blind adapt quickly.
Ward Three? Today, three newcomers
were gunned down by the guards.
So,I think that the
best solution would be that...
each ward, takes one body,
takes turns with the shovel...
...and they bury theirown share.
- What do you mean our share?
They're not ours.
Yes, but some of them would
have probably come to this ward.
After they were turned away
from yours... like I was.
Our ward is full.
The same here.
Okay, so we're all in
the same position, right?
Listen...
I don't wanna argue. I just
wanna have these people buried.
And I think the fair thing to do
is that each ward takes a body.
And then the job is quickly done.
All right?
Good.
Now, there's the matter
of food rationing.
It seems that one of the wards is
taking more than their fair share.
So, I'm proposing that we put
together some sort of committee...
with a representative
from each ward, and...
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?
Excuse me?
Yeah! Yeah!
Who do you think you are?
Giving all these orders.
I am. I'm the chosen representative
from Ward One.
And I suggest that you people
choose your own representative.
Otherwise we're gonna be at
each other's throats constantly.
- So you wanna talk to our leader?
- That's right.
Yeah, yeah. Like in a diplomatic
mission, negotiate?
Yeah? Well, here we have
a monarchy system.
And I hereby declare myself
the King of Ward Three.
- Long live the king!
- Long live the king!
- Any objections?
- Long live the king!
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Long live the king!
For my first pronouncement I declare
that everyone in Ward Three...
will eat dinner before we think
about getting, or burying any dead.
So, eat, eat. Come on, eat.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
You can't sleep like that.
You're filthy. Give me your clothes.
I'll wash them tomorrow.
Go to sleep.
How are you?
They don't know what it's like.
You gotta see it to believe it.
If you want something done,
you gotta do it yourself.
Okay. Okay.
Just try to get some sleep.
You're so hot.
- I know you can see.
- No, I can't...
...I don't know why you think that.
- Don't lie to me. You trust me, huh?
You trust me, then why
don't you tell me the truth?
You can't trust a thief, right?
I got a secret too.
You know what? I'm smart.
And when I went blind,
it made me think better.
I got a lot to contribute.
I'm sorry for being such a burden.
Oh, God!
I can't take this.
Come on, lie down.
Get some sleep.
What time is it?
What? What?
What's the matter?
Have you lost your sight?
I forgot to wind my watch.
You fuckers.
Are you in pain?
- Look at me!
- Did you hear that?
I'm gonna check it out.
- Hey, fuckers!
- What the fuck song is that?
- It sucks.
- You suck.
Whatever.
Fuck!
- Did you get him?
- Blood!
There's blood, man, step back!
It could be infected, step back!
The Sarge is gonna
fucking kill me.
- Is this the right way to go?
- Yeah.
You know, he told me he knew
I could see. He told me that...
...and I did nothing. Nothing.
- What could you have possibly did?
- You did everything you could.
- I think I've to tell them, and...
- And then what?
- And maybe...
- Become their slave?
- I could help. I could help.
- It's bad enough as it is.
- I can handle this.
No. I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about us. Us!
What?
You dressing me, bathing me,
wiping my ass.
For Christ sakes! It's hard
enough to think of you as...
As? As, as... what?
As a wife.
Instead of my mother.
Or... or a nurse
Well, you'll just have get
used to it, won't you? 'Cause...
I don't...
I don't have any choice.
You're right, I'll get used to it.
I guess I have to get used to it.
Do not tell a soul.
- Oh, come on!
- Attention! Attention!
The Government regrets having
been forced to exercise...
Fuck you!
Attention! Attention! Attention!
That's the last we're gonna
hear from that asshole.
We're taking over this shit hole
now. I'm the King of Ward Three.
And there's gonna be a
lot of changes around here.
- What the fuck is that?
- Number One:
If you wanna eat,
you'll have to pay for it.
And that's pretty much it, I guess.
Okay, and now,
for our ''grand finale''...
a little song that comes
from the bottom of my heart.
And it goes something like this:
I just called
To say I love you
- I just called to say...
- I'm turning it off.
- I'm turning it off.
- No, no!
I just called to say
How much I care
I just called
To say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom...
- I gotta push it!
- I've done it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Or I'll just keep on
shooting 'till somebody gets hit.
- Back off...
- God, you blind people are stupid.
Screaming and crying like babies.
Makes me ashamed to be one of you!
Ward Three is going to take
charge of the food right now.
- What?
- Like in a store!
And like in the real world,
we're gonna guard our store!
So, don't even think
of breaking in, okay?
So, how... how do we pay for it?
Excuse me.
Did I ask for any questions?
He means... he means
explain your rules.
How. What. What do
you want us to do?
Do want us to come one at a time,
or all together. What do you want?
- He said shut up!
- Okay. I'll tell you what!
We're gonna pile up the food, and
we'll let you know the rules later.
Now go back to your wards,
and get your money ready, okay?
- You know we don't have any money!
- Well, then whatever you got, lady!
Shoot her right now.
I mean, one less mouth to feed.
If I had eyes, she'd be
dead already, I tell you.
Now. Jewelry, lady.
For example, watches,
electronic shit.
Anything, anything you
think we might like.
- Excuse me?
- Yes? Yes?
- But how much is it for a meal?
- Well, man. I don't know!
Get your stuff together, and we'll
let you know what you deserve, okay?
And by the way!
Don't, don't hide anything!
All right? Understood?
Let's go! Let's go!
Lady? Lady?
Lady, I'll never forget your voice.
And I won't forget your face.
What the...
What the fuck?
Fuck.
- This is wrong, man.
- It's wrong but what else can we do?
- There's nothing to do.
- We can stick together...
...and just tell them ''no.''
- We're going to stick together.
I'm not giving my stuff up
because a nigger says I have to.
Hey, we don't know
what race he is, man.
- I can tell by his voice.
- Fuck you.
- Who the hell are these people?
- This is absolute bull shit!
We don't have to do
whatever the fuck they say!
Cause they make an announcement!
We don't have to back down!
- We can stand up to these guys!
- You're right!
- It's true.
- We don't have a choice.
- What?
- They've a weapon. They've a gun.
But the point is they
can't shoot us all!
Yeah, exactly!
Yes, but if they kill one of us,
then, it's too many!
I'm going to collect the valuables!
No one has to give if
they don't want to.
But don't expect to be fed at
the expense of the rest of us.
- Here.
- I don't have anything.
Don't worry.
I'll be like your mom, okay?
I'll pay for us both.
- What if you don't have anything?
- It's just jewelry, everybody.
What can we do with
it in here, anyway?
Each give according to what
they have, and all that.
Thank you.
Well, they better come
through with the food.
Why are we doing this?
This is what? Plastic?
There's so much junk.
You know,
I thought I told someone...
to just tell them not to even
bother putting the plastic in...
...because it's a waste of my time.
- I'll tell them. I'll tell them.
These have some weight.
That's gold.
Two rings, possibly a diamond.
Yeah? That's good.
Oh, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
Got something here.
We're fine with these people.
- Okay, good. That was close.
- It was actually, but it's okay.
- All right, one.
- One.
- Two.
- Two.
- And... three.
- Three.
- That's it.
- Three?
We normally get four
when we go by ourselves.
Well, now you get three. You keep
whining, you'll get two! Next!
We're coming!
- Next!
- We're here.
All right.
- We're from Ward One.
- Ward One?
Don't handle me!
Okay, okay.
We're not gonna hurt you here.
Want your food?
- Watch your manners.
- All right, it's here, it's here.
- I wonder. Can I touch this?
- Oh, man!
- Shit. Fell down.
- I think we've done.
Fuck!
- Nail polish, nail polish.
- We got some good stuff here.
- Yeah?
- Looking pretty good so far.
Yeah? Yeah, we're good?
All right.
Take it, take it.
- You're blind.
- Thank you, professor.
You're using a Braille writer.
No, you...
You're a normal blind person.
No, he's not normal.
He was born blind.
That makes him some kind of
super hero in a world like this.
- So you better watch out.
- You of all people...
born blind should
understand empathy...
...and human decency.
- Shut up. Shut up.
He's blind. That's all.
That doesn't make him good or bad.
That just makes him blind.
And now, he's blind with a purpose.
Because he's looking out for the
sick and the hungry of his own ward.
- That's right.
- How do you sleep with yourself?
That's all we get?
Is two boxes?
- Yeah, that's it.
- But the others got a third box.
How are we suppose to
survive on only two boxes?
That's it.
That's it, no more.
- It's immoral! A blind man...
- Shut up! Shut up!
- It's immoral!
- Shut up!
Shut up.
Fuck off with the sermon, okay?
Okay.
Get your food.
Get out.
And say ''thank you'' for
what you got. Understand?
Understand? Understand?
I understand.
Okay, okay.
Now say ''thank you.''
Thank you.
- All right. Okay.
- Out! Out!
- Don't let them get to you.
- No, it's fine! This fucking guy.
The son of a bitch.
He wants more.
- How many people are in Ward One?
- 35.
We only have 24 meals, so everyone
is gonna have to share.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
- This is all they gave us.
- Quit shoving, everybody! Relax!
Just find a partner.
Find a partner.
Two people to a meal.
Please!
Just don't push, okay?
Just stay in the line, okay?
Guys, guys, stop pushing!
- Wanna eat something?
- Stop.
You have to eat something.
You have to eat a little something.
Stop it!
Doctor?
- Are you here?
- Yes, I'm here.
Here.
Here. Here.
- I brought you some food.
- No. Jesus Christ, no.
- This place is a toilet!
- It's not your fault.
- You did everything you could.
- No, no, I didn't.
The son of a bitch, he had
his gun right in my throat.
- Exactly.
- I could've reached and taken it...
...but.
- And then what? And then what?
I don't know.
If you did kill him it
would've been way worse.
You would've started a
war for sure. A real war.
You're right.
Yeah, you're right. I'll pretend
like I thought that one through.
And it's not easy knowing that
you've killed someone. Like I did.
Oh, God!
- Hello?
- Don't say anything.
It'll be easier for
me to understand.
I'm sorry, it's my fault.
I wanted.
Let's be quiet.
Let's all be quiet.
I can see.
I knew that.
- At least I think I knew.
- It's a secret.
So...
it's been like a week or so...
and you people have
nothing left to offer.
So at Ward Three,
we came up with a new plan.
Bring us your women.
Women for food.
Have a good day.
What's going on?
We haven't eaten in three days!
We gave you all the food we have!
It's up to you to ration it!
Distribution is your problem!
- Asshole.
- Forget it! We're not doing that!
- Do you have any better idea?
- I'm not. I'm not. I'm not going!
I'm not gonna go!
- No!
- Bull shit!
No one's asking you to go.
Certainly not the men from this ward.
So, you can't blame us.
I think she brings up a good point.
And I think we should ask
if there are any volunteers.
- ''Volunteers?''
- What are you talking about?
Look, if there are any volunteers,
I think they should say so now.
I wonder how many volunteers would
we have if he said send us your men?
- It's not the same.
- Oh, really? And why's that?
Because it's just not.
- Because there's no fags here.
- Well, there's no whores either!
- That's debatable.
- I gave myself to you out of pity...
and now you think I'm some
sort of goddamn whore?
- Doctor?
- What?
Are you asking me for a
deliberation here? I mean, my God!
Of course I would rather
that my wife didn't go.
But, what I want really doesn't
matter. It's completely up to her.
My ''male pride'', of course,
is gonna be hurt.
But if that even exists in here,
what does it matter anyway?
We're all starving to death.
So, I just think that people should
do whatever they feel like doing...
according to whatever
morality they have left.
There's nobody, forget it!
Anybody.
- I'll go.
- No.
I'll go with her.
Me too.
- All right, all right. I'll go too.
- I'll go too.
Well, you do whatever you like,
but my wife is going nowhere.
Dignity has no price.
No one knows how
many women are here.
You can do what you like,
and we'll feed you both.
And then you can talk
to me about dignity.
- No, that's not the point.
- I'm no different than the rest.
- What?
- I'll do what they do.
You'll do what I tell you to do!
- Stop!
- Don't! Don't order me.
There's nothing worse.
No, it's disgusting.
From now on you don't eat.
How long do we wait before
they come and get us?
Get out of the way!
Good evening.
How many ladies?
Eight.
- Nine.
- Nine? Only nine?
Well, you nine, will have
to do double duty tonight.
If any of you is on the rag,
we don't want you.
We will get you some other time.
No one's on the rag.
Then, get yourselves all gussied
up and come over at your leisure.
We'll be waiting.
And the food will
follow if we're happy.
In the mean time I've...
I have brought you a little
bit of bread to tide you over.
I think I have one more.
There you go.
Let's go.
There's no point in trying to run.
They have guards.
At least it would be faster.
We'd be dead by now.
No one's gonna die.
Come on.
They're coming!
They're coming!
Hey. Welcome!
Girls, okay, don't be afraid.
We're here to love you. We're
not going to hurt you, all right?
Guys, don't get too excited,
all right?
Everyone's going to get
their own girl, okay?
We don't... Well, we share.
That's how we do things here, right?
Okay. I want you all in order
from hot to cold, okay?
The hottest, come here. And the
coldest go to the back of the line.
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong?
She's a bit of a dead fish. Take
care of her. Give her some life.
Oh, man. Where have
you been all my life?
Do I know you?
It's okay! Yeah.
I take it! I take it!
Why are you trembling?
Are you trembling?
No, easy, easy. Okay.
You two are coming with us.
Are you blonde?
Are you blonde?
Okay. All right.
Okay. A bit on the mature
side, but that's more I like it.
You like this?
That's my gun.
- You like it?
- No. I don't.
Lady? Lady?
Now, that's a surprise, lady.
You're coming with me. If you let
go I'll bite your nipples off.
Now, come on.
Now, suck. Come on.
- Come on.
- No!
I'm not asking, all right?
- Come on! Come on!
- I could bite it off.
Try it! I'll blow your fucking
head off! You and your friend.
Or I'll tear you to pieces.
Come on!
All right, lady!
Hey! Hey! Back it off!
All right!
There you go! Okay.
Okay, let's just speak.
Here we go.
It's okay, don't worry. You're so
tense. Please, sit down.
Get the fuck out of here!
Little bit tense, there we go.
May I suck on your nipples?
Just a... Just a little bit.
There we go.
That wasn't so bad.
It's just a little tickle.
Come on, dead fish.
Move for me! Come on!
Move now!
Someone go get the food.
What happened?
What happened?
You okay?
You want another story?
Women of Ward Two,
tonight is the big night!
- How many ladies?
- Seven.
Seven? You sure that's it?
Count them again.
- Seven!
- All right, if you've got seven.
How about the boy with
the magic powers?
- You like that one, don't you?
- Yeah.
- So, where did we leave off?
- This boy wasn't ordinary.
- No.
- He could turn invisible.
He had special powers.
And he turned invisible
when they weren't looking.
- All right.
- It's when they looked, he wasn't...
Good afternoon, ladies.
I just wanted to make sure
that you've all recovered...
from the fun that we
had the other night.
No, no. Seriously, I just wanted
to touch base with any of you...
that might be feeling a
little bit of jealousy...
I know that tonight
is not your night...
but I assure you that our
hearts are still with you.
You men folk should be
very proud of your ladies.
Very proud.
Well, one of them was
kind of a dead fish...
but the other ones
performed like real pros.
There are only eight of us now.
- Oh, what happened, did someone die?
- Yeah.
It's not a big deal, though.
She was kind of a dead fish.
I'm gonna finish the story later.
I promise.
I'll finish it later.
Who's that?
Where you going, huh?
Wait...!
It's you, isn't it?
What happened?!
Help!
What the fuck is going on?
I know you're here!
- You don't even know my name!
- No. I know your voice!
Just say one more word!
I dare you!
Your dead friend
said the same thing!
Don't let them leave!
Do not let them leave!
You idiots!
Do not let them leave!
- Let's go!
- You fucking jerks, stop them!
Come back!
Get back here!
That's it! That's it for you!
Ladies, no more food for you!
Everyday we go without food,
one of your men will die!
We collect from now on!
You missed!
He's dead!
What's going on?
Where are you? Where are you?
- Are you okay?
- Just go get the food.
They told me a man was killed.
I... I killed him.
Now there's gonna be a war.
They're going to want revenge.
We're gonna barricade our doors.
We'll use our beds like they did.
Whatever you say.
I'll get the food.
Oh, shit!
- Barricade it. Barricade it!
- You got the door?
- Two beds!
- So fucking what...
if send the women there twice a
month? We'll get fucking fed!
Stand it up!
Barricade the thing!
What I suggest we do is we find
out who killed their leader...
and offer them up like
a peace offering.
- We don't know what they're gonna...
- In exchange for food!
They have a stock pile!
We're in a state of war.
- And we started it.
- Yeah, exactly.
And I suggest we find out who killed
the leader, and we offer to the...
Look! Look!
If they won't give us food,
I say let's get it ourselves!
- I agree!
- Then, let's go!
Okay, I think he's right.
If anyone's wiling to go,
I think you should raise your hand.
That's about the most ridiculous
thing I've ever suggested.
How about:
Whoever doesn't wanna fight...
simply slip away right now,
and no one will know you were here?
And for those that are left, gather
around me, and we'll make a plan.
Here. Here.
Okay, how many of us are there?
- One.
- Two.
- Three.
- Twelve.
I can see twelve of us.
- What?
- She can see?
Don't touch my fucking bed!
- What are you doing?
- What?
- I heard something!
- Someone's here!
- Who's there?
- I heard somebody!
- Who's there?
- I heard somebody!
I have a chair over here.
If anybody could happen...
Let's go, come on!
Grab the person in front of you.
Stay in a tight group!
Alright.
Straight ahead.
What...
If we go back!
We can't go back! Come on.
Let's move!
- What's that?
- Smoke.
Fire!
Don't push!
Fire!
It's okay! It's okay!
Stay there!
I'm gonna come in get you.
Upstairs.
Upstairs.
Watch!
- Here. Here I am. Hold on to him.
- They're going to shoot us.
Guards! Guards!
You see what is going on?!
Guards!
We're free!
It's empty.
Go on in.
- Step up.
- We're in a shop.
Everyone, please, stay together.
I don't wanna loose anybody else.
Step up. All right.
I'm gonna go look for food.
- I'll go with you.
- No, I can do better on my own.
Stay here and look after each other.
It's something you can do better.
Get out!
This place is occupied!
There are other groups out there.
Do not leave this spot.
I know you can do it.
But how can you carry the
food back on your own?
Is there anything?
Is there running water?
I'll look for bottles.
- I guess there's electricity.
- No.
Are there any signs that
people can still see?
What's happening?
I miss you.
I miss you so much.
Here's a supermarket.
I'll go in.
- Okay.
- Step up.
I'll stay here.
I know my place.
Stay off my fucking spot!
I'm coming back! I'll fucking kill
you! You stay off my fucking spot!
Give it to me, you thief!
You thief! You thief! Give it back!
Hey! Hey!
I can here you near
my fucking spot!
Go! Go! Go!
What do you have there?!
What are you eating?!
Smells like meat!
- No! No!
- Stop!
Let on!
It's me! It's me!
Go! Go! Go!
Okay.
Are you alright?
Are you okay?
Okay. Okay.
- I have... I have to stop.
- Stop. Stop.
Stairs.
- You're all right. You're safe.
- Thank you.
I've go back and get those clothes
before I forget where they are.
Here, eat something.
I'm just trying to say...
people screaming out loud...
that God is hiding...
that we failed and
that God is punishing us.
This is not what is happening. God,
it's not. This is not the God's way.
What is happening to us reminds
me of what happened to St. Paul.
Paul used to kill Christians,
used to persecute them...
but the Lord came to
him and converted him.
And not only converted him,
but blinded him.
This is what's happening to us.
- Here!
- Here!
- Here I am!
- Here!
Here.
Here, I have a jacket.
- I have a jacket.
- Thank you.
That's terrible.
- Who would do that?
- Someone who went blind.
And then he went crazy.
Since he couldn't see...
he didn't want his statue to see.
- I don't think so, little man.
- I don't know if it'd be possible...
for a blind man to paint
the painting like that.
- Yes, they could.
- Or likely a priest...
who saw what happened,
and had a crisis of faith.
No, but seriously, all those people
made me think of how lucky we are...
that we have a leader with vision.
So, I think it's up to you to
decide what we should do next.
Well...
I think we should stay here tonight,
try to get some sleep.
And then, tomorrow, I was thinking
that we could go to our house.
lt's pretty near here,
and it's big...
so it can accommodate everybody.
Where are you, dog?
Still there?
No. Don't follow that dog.
He'll lead you to a fire hydrant.
Too proud to be a seeing eye dog.
Twenty seven.
Five four.
Black hair.
Brown eyes.
I don't wanna know
what you look like.
But how can we know each other?
I know that part inside
of you with no name.
And that's who we are,right?
When you went to look for food,
we talked to this man...
that was part of a group
that moved around together...
trying to find food and shelter.
Each night they slept
in a different place.
I asked him why he didn't
sleep in his own home.
And he said he didn't know
where it was anymore.
- Yeah,he lost it.
- They're welcome to it...
if they can find their
way to my little room.
I think it's okay. Here we are.
Here we are. Looks fine.
Come in. Come in.
I can't believe it.
It's exciting.
Okay. Careful. Just because
the door was locked...
doesn't mean that no one's here.
Hello! Hello!
Hello! Is anyone here?
Maybe we should take
our shoes off. Right?
That's a good idea.
You can leave them by the door.
We don't wanna mess the place up.
We just arrived.
If you wanna take off
your clothes too...
we have plenty of
clean ones upstairs.
- Thank you.
- Are you talking to me?
No, to everyone. Our clothes
are just as dirty as our shoes.
- Here? All together?
- Come on!
She's the only one who can see!
If it makes you feel better,
it's getting pretty dark.
All right.
If you insist.
I'm sure you've seen worse
sights than this old body.
I want you to feel at home here
because this is your home now too.
Thank you both. We're all flattered
that you would offer your home.
It's our pleasure.
Kick us out when you had enough.
Or when I become
too much of a burden.
Just tell me, and I'll just
wander off like an elephant.
- You're not an elephant.
- I'm not a man, either.
- You're plenty of a man, babe.
- I...
I don't know.
I haven't seen myself in so long.
I must look ridiculous.
No, no. Dirty and skinny.
But not ridiculous. Not at all.
-And what about me?
-You're beautiful.
Yeah. Not like you.
- You've never seen me.
- But in my dreams you're beautiful.
How come you never appeared in my
dreams but I know you're beautiful?
Well, that's why blindness
is a gift to the ugly.
- Come on, you're not serious.
- No...
but I suppose I was
more beautiful before!
We were all more beautiful before.
Is anyone cold?
- It feels so good!
- I'm having a great time!
Hello?
It's me.
- I brought you some hot water.
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm gonna pour it down, okay?
- Okay.
- Feels good?
- Feels good.
I hope we can find
the boy's parents.
What do you hope for?
Nothing is more ridiculous than
the desires of an old man.
Tell me. lwanna know.
You wouldn't understand.
- Why that tone of voice?
- What tone?
That one.
What I hope is that we
can go on living together.
- As we are. Like this.
- Blind?
For me nothing has been better.
- I'd want us to live together.
- Together with me, or with everyone?
Don't make me say.
I want to know.
Are we alone?
Is anyone listening?
Good.
Good.
I wanna live with you.
I remember that New Year's.
It was cold, but I didn't mind.
All right. At this end of the table
we have pees and carrots.
At the center we've olives in a bowl
and some crackers on a small plate.
And, at the far end of the table,
we have anchovies.
Anchovies!
Don't we have a special bottle of
something sparkling for our guests?
There's nothing like water.
Clean water.
I'd like to propose a toast.
To our family.
- To our human family.
- And the dog!
- And the dog!
- And the dog! And the dog!
- Salute!
- Salute!
Much better than any champagne.
I see you.
When I touch you like this,
I see your face.
So beautiful.
It's all I need to remember.
- Tell me, is this working?
- Let's see. You take another one.
Take another of me in the face.
Blind inspiration.
There's coffee,
if anybody wants some.
- I'll have some, please.
- I want some too.
I need to wake up.
Honey? Honey?
I think we should get together
and talk about what we need to do.
There's not much food left,
and I'm worried about security.
- Okay.
- I can pour it for you.
It's hot.
It's you.
It's you! Oh, my God!
It's everyone at here.
Hi.
- What?
- I can see you!
- What are you saying?
- I can see you!
- What?
- Yes.
- What are you talking about?
- Everything is beautiful!
I can...
- What?
- Oh, my God!
- What do you mean, you can see?
- Hey, you! I can see you.
I got back my sight!
- What is it?
- Come here.
- I can see!
- How?
- I can see!
- You're lying.
- What?
- Really?
- You have your sight?
- Yeah!
You're kidding!
- You're eyes!
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, my God!
- He can see!
- I can't believe it!
- He sees! He sees!
- I thought he was kidding!
- No.
- Hey, you guys!
- What this mean?
I can see everybody's face!
- Oh, my gosh!
- I know. I can't believe it!
I can see you. I love you guys!
You guys are so beautiful!
At that moment...
the same unspoken thought
occurred to everyone:
"He was the first to go blind.
Perhaps...
we will all regain
our sight in turn."
So the celebration was
not entirely selfless.
The next days,
the next weeks...
would therefore be
sleepless with anticipation.
They would see again.
This time, they would really see.
But who would be so timid...
as to cling to this
blanket of blindness?
Who would be so
foolish as to fear...
that its intimacies might be lost?
And what of this woman...
who is now so strangely silent...
who has borne such a
terrible weight...
and is now so suddenly free?
Already she could imagine the
voices of the city, shouting:
"I can see!"
"I'm going blind", she thought.
