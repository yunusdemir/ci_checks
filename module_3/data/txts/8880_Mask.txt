It was not until I received the title
And territory, which he had promised only.
Perhaps I should put it well is.
I hope its not too impatient

My boy, I would not have...

opportunities can expect him back in the US?
Think of the immense land
Thirteen colonies and restaurant jobs
Are ripe for harvesting.
I never did anything

Yes.
- Both things are required.
- Everything.
- I had to build their work...
- And you have to build muscle Map
By doing exactly what I told him

And he is the person we need in America.
I resigned.
I'm ready to close this matter as his

It was proposed to him.

Hopefully he had not infected with any disease

- No, Ms. Witherspoon.
- I know that terrible disease too.
He had recovered yet?
I think so, Ms. Holloway.
I hope it will not obstruct the work he did preach

Anything was better than the old facility

Mgr.
His  How are you?
Yes. Why did you come here?
Mother told me to invite  him dinner.
She cooks his forte.
You agree to use it?
Yes. Yes, of course.
"And so the days dragged into weeks."
"When you're at her side, Charlotte,"
"Darkness seems very distant."
We are very fond of him and I hope he
know that.
"We"?
Well, my mother very happy to have him here.
Yes, I understand.
And you?
He is an elected
very good friend at work.
So you saved me from drowning
only to do the job you elected?
What else?
Because she was very kind.
- She is compassionate, virtuous...
- Stop it.
Please sir, I am not worthy
spoken such words.
Charlotte, I feel like I have a new life
here.
Thanks to her which I have this life.
Only God can give us
new life.
God's not man up and take me from the pond.
How I learned the way of the Lord?
If five minutes early
Or five minutes later, it may have
everything else.
That's the mystery.
How he felt, he Walters?
I feel able to trust
entrust her life.
I have never felt that before.
If it's God's will or determinism,
She called anyway,
- Then we are willing to accept.
- "If" it?
That led him to become a vicar
Seem uncertain about what he believes there.
Charlotte, I... I'm
told her very sincere.
From the bottom of my heart.
It really makes me confused.
Steven, I have a boy
Will visit this Christmas.
You're about to travel to the US
And he invited me to come along.
And she agreed to star?
I is difficult to refuse.
Mother
believe that this will be a great experience for me.
But leave this place...
I have reason to stay right?
She wants us to her a reason right?
Only if there is a justifiable reason.
Charlotte.
Charlotte, I do not know whether her swim
.
Thank guy.
I do not know how to swim.
It's embarrassing.
- I support her ashore.
- Yes.
Guy is lucky you were here.
Good evening, Father.
Or Pastor eh?
I keep or confusion.
Come near the fire so I can see him.
So he came to my old bachelor.
None.
They  I thought you were dead.
So I was surprised how
when discovered him back from the dead.
That pushed me into
an embarrassing situation, Will.
I still vow loyalty to Charles Kemp
must hold.
So what does he suggest?
I have kept a few belongings
Could ruin my senior.
- If in the hands of the right people.
- I am listening.
I'm keeping the report of Parliament
previous day.
Not Kemp speaks of that is the real
.
The names, status, financial transactions are recorded
therein.
So I go to negotiate with the old
And he can make the price you want.
Wow.
It's very noticeable.
I think a priest would use such a report
Job to expose his evil
Kemp.
But he was not a monk,
not it, Will?
I have found new life.
A vicar.
What a ridiculous
mask he was wearing.
If that's not a mask, why?
So he revealed to her
who you are yet?
Why did not you speak out
To see his lady
then think about him?
Hands he was bloodstained.
I ask him
Please
Take report
And walked away.
I will.
Along with his corpse
And any reward he will give me
.
Hell've been waiting so long,
... Will Reynolds.
Do you think I'm better than me?

Why do you know my father was he?
Why do you ask?
Gosh rub.
This the parish priest about it?
I see that you are very fond of him.
He's a gentleman,
And smart and...
And enjoyed the conversation,
And full of surprises.
Do you love him do not?
I can.
I can,
But something makes you uneasy about his
it.
And I wish with all my heart that we human
would go,
Will start.
But I always felt
Lacking something.
Sometimes he speaks of God as a stranger
so.
He had doubts.
If you have to leave this place,
I certainly will remember him well.
You should ask him about himself.
You that I have understanding, you should ask him
advice.
No hurry at all.
I simply can not make a decision about going
US without
Consider his feelings for Steven first
.
But he was not a monk,
, right?
He is no different -old himself.
Hands he was bloodstained.
Please let me know what to do
children.
Charlotte.
Everything all right?
None.
Not good at all.
There are things about me that...
I am not the person that I...
I have to say is in the past...
When I uttered the prayer,
're Not trained as a vicar.
Quality training

What we are trying to say is...
I do not deserve her.
I know who deserved her
Deserve certain things better
anything that I...
I am not a good person.
But I aspire to be good.
Thinking takes her
makes it unbearable.
She had dispel the misery in me.
I began to appreciate that.
I do not deserve that.
I guess what I mean is...
Pray do not go to America.
I do not want to be separated from her.
Lady Holloway, ta...
She has agreed to marry me?
His  Walters...
Please do not...
- Do not call me that.
- I'm sorry, Steven.
I can not.
I want to say is...
I have not been able to answer him.
Not because I do not want to agree to it.
I want too.
But I do not...
Really trust yourself...
Alone can give
this important decision.
Charlotte.
I will do anything.
He'll see you my Christmas

Well. Of course we will meet.

If only because the ancient loyalty,
I served him in the Indian...
She's not the same category as him.

Ms. Holloway,
She can believe in mouse sin?
A man may...
Sacrifice his life for others

And regain the trust of the people?
It's a difficult question.
Because I believe in forgiveness.
And trust.
That man will...
Get people to forgive.
I'm sorry, someone is coming.
Charlotte.
She knew the man.
He was assigned to multiple crimes.
The crimes that he did not do.

The paper is this?
Is this a joke?
Shogun, please hear me.

I'm sure that Mr. Kemp
has swapped it.
Just look as these documents

It can prevent the bombing in Philadelphia.
And he just said that he had found them...
From 9 months before.
Then an innocent man...
Why not deliver it to their governments

Really too bad.
Tomorrow I will take what I deserve
being.
Fact is...
Someone stole something you deserve.
Tonight he'll be free.
There is a girl,
She wanted to see him on deck.
- She should not have come here.
I have to meet him.
I do not know what to say to anyone.
I can speak privately with him
.
They make him hurt?
I never told her.
That we fear ourselves.
The things we do.
My fate.
She was very kind to us.
But I really do not dare
embrace it.
I was very distressed.
But I was enlightened.
God and his people.
I talked to them and we had a good
agreement.
He will baptize me.
William, really?
It.
I have been liberated from the suffering...
In our lifetime.
- William, I come...
- I tried,
I will cherish this life more.
I come here...
And that's my name.
That is not my true self.
Will.
I have to think it through before.
William.
He must save me.
What?
Charlotte.
The girl fell into the water then.
The girl fell into the water and then!
The girl fell into the water then.
They are over there.
Do not shoot the girl.
Do not say this is a rescue plan your

Kids  He planned
destroying the entire Philadelphia.
They are over there.

There she is.
We see her then, ma'am.
Give me your hand.
Where is He?
What...
Very good rating.
<i>Charlotte?</i>
Charlotte?
She is also very strong there.
He has never asked where?
I also had escaped from prison there.
I do but go to prison.
You should back the gallows,
Or is at peace in my carriage.
On 4 May 7.
She found them
Where?
In the office of his brother.
She stole it.
Checked only.
And my purpose is
at Philadelphia.

He spoke to something.

That's the important position.
The key people.

Focus Now?
He was targeting Congress.

There she is.
- Let me go.
- You must come with us.
- Take your hands off me.
- Scat.

You're good for her she just wanted to stop.
You should not stay here.
Everyone let out immediately.
There is a plan to bomb
to this building.
Bosh.
We can not delay any more.
Wait.
I know him.
Yes, sir.
I'm William Reynolds.
Step by mercenaries but...
Company he had hired.
Good.
So nothing serious.
Say whatever he wants.
But the true threat.
Giam him back.
Gunpowder.
A lot of gunpowder.
When will begin voting.
At noon.
But who?
Charles Kemp.
He also worked in his company.
Where is this?
She experiment yourself go.
This place is for you.
Sir, his niece has arrived.
I have been informed that she is
a spoiled girl.
I'm sorry, honey.
But I chose the wrong side then.
Electric conductors.
Electric will make it explode.
Start the generator.
The whole things.
Machine genius Dr.
He used windmills to rotate the wheel
,
And transmission dynamics in the generator,
Invisible sparks.
And when you push the lever that,
It will move the generator...
To connectors on it.
And when it has enough power,
It will transmit energy out.
Take the line that we have to put under the city
.
Through his drainage system Franklin.
And
wires that will lead to anything?
It is the powder keg,
has been put into place.
In fact, the current will be better
detonate it.
The person intends to kill
How many people use?
So hostage is how many people will die...
If war occur between
Britain and other countries.
How much to use?
How many people will be dying?
Enough.
They need to understand that the independence...
Can not be created by their legal
.
So it was created by something?
We need to unify all.
I'm sorry, I love game.
Thursday will blow the whole city.
Doctoral course and we're leaving,
But I do not.
Basil, tied her again.
God mercy.
He blew up the whole city.
How could he
create such power?
Thunder?
Too risky.
Science can do.
But be very large generator.
And situated in a central location.
Ropes.
The ties will lead to a generator.
Just destroy the transmitter.
Maybe you'll need this.
God bless you, son.
Energy detonation will be loaded enough
in five minutes.
Urgently go to him.
'll Be time then.
He goes.
It is named in Expressway.
Getting him back.
Do not let him escape.
Harrison, do exactly as planned.
Will.
I'm afraid that Harrison was napping.
I am sure that he Harrison
Would never wake up.
Charlotte.
Monday will make the city exploded.
I will not let that happen.
Solve it.
Harrow, carried away.
Yes, sir Kemp.
There is something wrong?
Energy is exceeded.
Just activate it, Dr.
Generators are turning too fast.
- The transmitter is broken already.
- Fixing it right away.
How quickly go.
It's still not ready.
The machine was running again.
But
transmitter was energized, Mr. Kemp.
I do not care!
Do not!
He Kemp!
We have no time left.
We must go.
Unable to this city exist.
Fact that we helped you.
To see the real man behind the mask
.
He was a monster.
We have the time to make decisions
.
I'm there.
She must pull the lever that again.
Please prepare independence goes,
Mr. Franklin.
I can not let you do that anywhere, I love game.
He Kemp, go.
The machine is unstable.
Will.
<i>Will.</i>
You believe that you can
prevent this?
Only a few seconds only, Mr. Kemp.
If you touch it, you will surely die
.
Come on, Will.
You have done very precisely what I want you to do
.
I understand you.
This is not what you want to do.
You're right, Mr. Kemp.
This is the job I want to do.
But that is not my own work too.
Congress July 4, 1776.
The result of the vote had.
Franklin his decision was approved.
- I'll pay for it.
- Shut up.
- You will pay the price.
- Scat.
What is it?
Wait, wait.
- What happened?
- Crime will be executed.
It seems that she will not see him again where
.
- Two people go bye.
- What? This is bullshit.
He needs to see a doctor.
He was wounded.
The people will hang him
after everything back?
We have not decided
punishment for him...
Because he caused in New York.
I can not ask her to go with me
.
I've caused too much trouble for him.
He thought now I can
leaving him why?
I can not escape it anywhere.
His  Franklin will protect him.
And you anymore.
From the first time I met her,
I was captivated by her kindness.
That day he looked very funny.
I want to say.
From the last time we met,
I have tried to find an appropriate time...
To give her this ring.
She said that we have never asked.
Now we're asking here.
She has allowed  I do not care for her?
In our side.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Of course it is.
I agree.
We'll be together right?
True.
Thinking.
This will be drafted by our laws
.
Go.
I hope that he knows he is doing.
What is it?
His  Franklin.
Dear William Reynolds brave.
He has contributed greatly to our country.
I'm really grateful for it
and I want to thank you.
But they'll never know.
It is a new beginning
that we for him.
This car will not go to prison...
That will come to my house.
We will contribute to this country.
