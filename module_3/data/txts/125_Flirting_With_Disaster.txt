You know, it's starting to feel like
this whole thing is a big waste of time.
<i>- You're feeling frustrated.
- Yes, I'm feeling very frustrated.</i>
<i>I was worried your expectations were
too high for all of this.</i>
<i>- You know, maybe we should just forget everything and go home.
- Don't do that.</i>
You always get so pessimistic when you're
close to finishing something you've started.
<i>- I do not.
- Yes, you do. You did it with the apartment.</i>
You loved it so much. The day we go to
sign the lease you start freaking out.
And the wedding. How many times
did you change the date?
You're right. You're right.
I do this all the time.
<i>So, stick to your plan
for once, okay?</i>
<i>If you want to find your parents,
find your parents.</i>
- Oh!
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- Are you okay? You seem upset.
I owe you a big apology.
I mean, this is not the way I planned this
trip, not the way I wanted it to turn out.
<i>Look, it's been kind of difficult, but
I think we've gotten past the bumps.</i>
You know, I feel really good
about where we're going.
I really think
it's going to be great.
You're such an optimist.
Where does that come from?
Well, you know, I've always said it's
a mistake to let pessimism take over...
right before you're about
to finish something.
That's the complete opposite of my
ex-husband. He was such a pessimistic pig.
Well, I think you're doing
a great job. Really.
- Really.
- Thanks.
- Good night.
- Good night. Good night.

Thanks.
Shit.
What was that noise?
Did you drop something?
Goddamn cat flew out of nowhere.
Scared the hell out of me.
<i>- What are you doing?
- Huh?</i>
<i>Where'd you get
that pup tent?</i>
L... I'm feeling very sexual!
I don't know.
I'm just feeling like I wanna...
Let me just take
my glasses off.
Wait a second.
Wait, Mel!
Mel, look at me.
Just slow down for a second.
Let's take our time.
Look at me.
Why aren't you looking at me?
What, what? I'm looking at you!
Why do I have to look at you?
Why can't
you look at me?
<i>I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.</i>
I mean, don't you ever think
that maybe it's not natural...
for two people to be together
their entire lives?
<i>- Do you ever think that?
- Oh... I get it.</i>
Your parents
weren't good enough for you.
And now I'm not good enough for you
because Tina's a skinny dancer, right?
<i>- No. What?
- It takes some women...</i>
more than a year to get back to their
normal weight after having a baby.
<i>You are not good B-and-B people.!</i>
That's because
we hate B-and-B's!
- Look, we need to talk.
- Okay.
I'm not sure I'm ready for an affair
with a married man right now.
I'm feeling just as confused as you are.
Okay? About the whole thing.
I'm in the middle of a divorce.
I'm going to school at night.
You know, I need to be
taken seriously as a woman.
I want to have my own children.
I want to have my own life! You know?
Not just some vicarious semblance
of like somebody else's life.
Shit.
- What's the matter with her?
- Hi.
She's upset about the way
everything is going. She's really...
- Listen. I feel like I owe you an apology about last night.
- Okay.
<i>- We should discuss it because there's two sides to everything.
- Hey, you guys.!</i>
That doesn't sound
like an apology.
What the hell?
<i>- Hey.!
- Hello again, strangers.</i>
I'm sorry that I stormed out
like that last night.
<i>But I suffer from hypertension.
You probably already knew that.</i>
The whole thing was a blessing. It finally
made Paul realize how much he needs R-and-R.
Sometimes you gotta be zonked
on the head. What can I say?
<i>- Wait a minute. You guys are going to New Mexico?
- We're goin', yeah.</i>
Nothing like the cruel acceptance
of a casual invitation, right?
- What invitation?
- I think you were in the bathroom.
- Oops, did we jump the gun here?
- No, this'll be fine!
No, wait. What do you mean
it's fine? It's fine?
We're just gonna do some sightseeing.
We're not gonna get in your way.
I'm glad to have the company.
It's gonna be fun!
- We already checked in. Why don't I find a row for the baby?
- Terrific!
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks.
<i>We'll see you on board, Mel.</i>
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't expect them to show up.
- So, what? You had a little hostility to work out?
- It isn't hostility.
- I just barely mentioned it to them.
- Right, great, great. Whatever, okay?
I wasn't circumcised
until I was a year old.
- Wow! Why?
- I had hypospadias.
- What is that?
- Well, hypospadias is like a curvature of the penis.
- They have to adjust it with a whole operation.
- Really?
Yeah. I had it done when I was young.
I mean, it's fine now.
Here you go. Honey, why don't you
cover yourself up?
I just finished nursing him,
okay?
Ever heard of hypospadias?
Is there something wrong
with the plane?
<i>- How is the nipple irritation?
- It's really bad, actually.</i>
<i>You know why?
Because I was watching you...</i>
and I think you might be holding him
at the wrong angle.
- I've been doing this for a while now.
- I know you have.
But you see, when he's under
your breast like this...
see, he pulls down on the nipple
which obviously causes more irritation.
But if you're out here and bring him
straight in to the breasts... You know?
- I mean...
- How'd you get to be such an expert on all this?
- I went out with a woman who was a midwife.
- Really?
- Yeah. You have very beautiful breasts.
- Thank you.
- I remember them from high school.
- Do you?
Not that I was like looking at them,
but I just saw them in passing.
- Hey, Paul, do you mind finding another seat?
- I won't look.
No, no, no, no. We need it
for the baby to stretch out.
- It would really help us out.
- Oh. Another seat, huh?
- Yeah.
- Oh, oka... Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Thanks a million.
- No, that's... Okay.
- Thanks.
- Hey, thanks for the water.
- Yeah.
That's the headache
pressure point.
- Can you feel it?
- Yeah.
Is there something happening here
that I haven't been clued into?
Paul, would you mind
finding another seat?
This is wonderful. This is great.
I can't believe how naive I am.
Sir, I can't have you moving around.
Please sit in your assigned seat.
Okay, okay.
Is anybody sitting here?
Does anybody actually own a white
Taurus, or are they all rentals?
The is the most reliable midsize in
America according to all the big reports.
- I'm feeling very depressed.
- What are you feeling depressed about?
- I feel like there's an agenda and it's not what I had in mind.
- What agenda?
Do I have to spell it out? I'm the fifth
wheel. How do you think that makes me feel?
We're riding in two cars until we get
to the B-and-B. That's not an agenda.
- Let's just hit the road.
- You don't mind if he rides with you, right?
- Why can't he ride with you?
- See what you're doing to me?
Ride with us! I don't care.
Ride with us.
Oh, that's so generous of you. You know, I
think I'll ride with illicit couple number two.
Oh, no. He does this to me
every eight months.
I ought to get used
to it by now.
- What? What does he do?
- He gets antsy and he runs off with somebody else.
I think that's common among
certain types of married men.
I'm the rock, he's the flake.
So that's life.
That's what my ex-husband used to say
when he was trying to feel superior to me.
<i>Tony's flights of terror from his own life
have nothing to do with my superiority.</i>
Well, it's not terror that makes
people wander. It's vitality.
I see. Is it vitality that led Mel
to leave his wife for you?
- Paul, would you mind riding in the other car?
- I don't know. I don't mind.
- Good. Could we just pull over here?
- Yeah.
So what happened
in the other car anyway?
Paul was probably
lecturing them, right?
<i>I wasn't lecturing them. I was asking
questions. That's all. I wasn't lecturing.</i>
Oh, my God, is that...
You brought your gun.
Absolutely, I brought it. You never know
when you'll get beeped for an emergency.
You're such a hopeless workaholic.
We're on vacation, for God's sake.
<i>- It's such a good time!
- Mel gets like that too. Then he can't enjoy anything.</i>
If you can't commit to our marriage now, what
are you gonna do when we have a baby, huh?
Why can't he ride with you, huh?
You invited them in the first place.
- Could you pass me the Baby Wipes?
- Where are you going?
- To pee.
- You just gonna... Right here?
You're just gonna...
squat.
Why did you have to take
your keys with you to pee, anyway?
I just wasn't thinking, okay?
- I don't know how many times I've told you to keep your keys in one place.
- Shut up! Fuck.
Nancy was saying you guys were
having some tension around oral sex.
- Oh, was she?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Hey, it happens to me too.
You know a technique that
I find useful: Humming to myself.
- Humming to yourself?
- Yep, humming.
- Seems to release the tension so I can enjoy the fellatio. It's great.
- Great!
- Thank you. Thanks for the tip.
- You bet.
Do you worry about the risk factor
involved in gay sex?
It may be news to you,
but not every gay man has anal sex.
- That's where a lot of the H. I. V. Risk lies.
- For example, I'm very anal.
I mean, in the sense that I'm compulsively
careful and clean about what touches my body.
- Not into penetration at all.
- To a fault.
Do we have to talk
about this right now?
Why not? Are you a homophobic?
I think it's interesting.
Really, I think maybe...
- Nancy's just testing the risk factor for sex with Tony, Mel.
- What?
- Paul, don't patronize her.
- I'm not patronizing.
She knows that I came of age
in the era of Al DS.
And even though I'm bisexual,
I've been incredibly careful. Okay?
- Tested negative three times in the last seven months.
- Really?
You remember correctly.
Three times.
<i>I'm sorry. Maybe we should've sprung
for an updated edition, huh?</i>
I mean, the picture's right here.
It was a nice B-and-B.
They probably had something about the
uranium contamination in the new edition.
Did it ever occur to you
to call first?
Without spontaneity, the world
of B-and-B's is fairly meaningless.
I hope you have a tent,
because that's the only way...
you can be spontaneous
in the desert at this hour.
Maybe Mel's parents
can suggest a place.
Oh, right. I'm gonna
show up with 50 people.
"Hi, I haven't seen you
for about 30 years. This is my posse.
And Nancy invited along
these two gay guys just for fun.
<i>And, you know,
we're gonna be here for a while. "</i>
What does gay guys
have to do with anything?
It has nothing to do with anything.
I didn't mean to be insulting.
<i>Then why'd you say it,
neurotic guy?</i>
- That's my designation?
I'm neurotic guy? - Mm-hmm.
<i>I don't think you know
me well enough to call me neurotic guy.</i>
Oh, really?
Gay guy isn't intimate?
Look, do you want to file
an anti-defamation suit...
or get to the Schlichting's
before midnight?
<i>Is this another surprise
visit or did you call first this time?</i>
<i>- I spoke with them already. I told you that.
- What? What?</i>
What, do you want to get intimate?
Is that what you're saying?
Huh? No?
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
<i>Lend me your comb
It's time to go home</i>
<i>Gotta confess</i>
<i>My hair is a mess</i>
<i>Your mama will scold</i>
<i>Your daddy will shout</i>
<i>Unless we come in</i>
<i>The way we went out</i>
<i>Kissing you was fun
Honey bun</i>
<i>Thanks for the date</i>
<i>Time has come
Honey, honey bun</i>
<i>You know, baby
it's a-gettin'late</i>
<i>Just wait 'til I</i>
<i>Straighten my tie</i>
<i>Lend me your comb</i>
This is a long porch.
It's a beautiful house, though.
Sorry.
- Think you could wait back in the car?
- I gotta go to the bathroom.
Hi! It's so late,
we were getting worried.
- Hope my directions were all right.
- They were great.
- This place is so isolated.
- That's what we love about it too.
I'm Tina Kalb.
We spoke on the phone.
- Oh, yeah, right!
- We were shocked to get your call yesterday.
I'm amazed you ran into Fritz Boudreau
after all these years.
<i>- He's something.
- Well, he never got over the fact Mary left him for me.</i>
Which one of you
is Mel?
That's me.
Mary Schlichting.
<i>- Oh, so that's how you pronounce it?
- Nobody ever gets it right.</i>
- And this must be your wife.
- Nancy.
- Nancy, hi. Welcome to our family.
- Look at the baby!
<i>- He's sleeping.
- These are friends.</i>
- Tony and Paul.
- Mr. Schlichting. Mrs. Schlichting.
<i>- Paul. How you doin'?
- They were gonna stay at Rancho Arroyo.</i>
- Oh, my goodness. You can't stay there.
- No. They found that...
<i>- Uranium, yeah.
- Highly toxic.</i>
<i>Thank God that's far away.
You don't have to worry.</i>
Could you recommend
a motel?
- No! There isn't a decent motel for 100 miles.
- No need to go to a motel.
- And we have plenty of room here for all of you.
- Oh, thank you. Great.
- I don't want everyone to stay here with you.
- Why can't everyone stay here?
- This is a private thing.
- If I could just lay down. I'd like to go right to bed.
- Sure. Let me help you. Do you want to eat before...
- No, thanks. I'm not hungry.
Nancy, come on.
You're always hungry.
- Fuck you.
- What? I'm, I'm sorry?
This isn't the time
or the place for this.
But it was the time and place to
wrestle with her in San Diego, right...
<i>and break a bunch
of glass animals?</i>
<i>That's fine?
That was a perfect time?</i>
I'm sorry.
Is this inappropriate?
Nothing in this house is inappropriate.
We'll be upstairs.
I'll get the bags.
I think I wanna lay down too.
I bet you would.
Hmm.
- Having some problems?
- Yeah, we're kind of having a little bit of a... Yes.
It's some kind of a swapping thing
you've got here?
No, no, no, no, no. Just there's
a little friction. That's all.
- And these guys came along with us.
- You know, marriage is tough.
- You gotta be flexible in marriage.
- Yeah.
<i>This thing is wonderful,
by the way. Who made this?</i>
<i>- That's my work.
- Really? You did this?</i>
I got a blacksmith's shop
out in the barn.
I do my sculptures there
and Mary throws her pots.
- Really? She's into pottery?
- She's gonna love showing you her pottery.
This is slab construction.
If you can see the...
When I roll it out that I have weeds
in with the rolling pin.
- I press them into the surface.
- Just ordinary weeds.
<i>- You put the weeds in the clay?
- And when you fire it, the weeds burn off.</i>
- Where the weeds were, you get...
- Stick your fingers in here.
- Oh, yeah.
- No, stick two fingers inside and just caress it. That's it.
<i>- There you go.
- Now feel the texture on... Against your face.</i>
Oh, it's very rough.
It looks rough,
but it's very smooth, isn't it?
Right. It's smoother
than you would think, but still...
This is wonderful.
Great stuff.
And you guys, you make
your living through the arts, huh?
Well, we try. Sometimes
you have to supplement.
Yeah, you have to supplement
with other things.
These are all mine.
Every one of them, I made them.
Oh, I want to show you
a big one I love!
This environment is so much more
creative than the one I grew up in.
- Thanks, that's nice.
- This is a wood fire process.
<i>Who's that?</i>
<i>- That's our other son.
- You mean I have a brother?</i>
- Mm-hmm.
- Want to say hello to Lonnie?
He's feeling a little threatened about
meeting you, so be patient with him.
Hi! How you doin'? That's
a beautiful song you're playing there.
- Is supper almost ready?
- We better go in and eat.
He's been cooking
all day.
<i>Bagged the quail himself this morning.
- Ooh, wild quail! Terrific.</i>
<i>You're in for a great treat.
Lonnie's a really good cook.</i>
Ooh, the Special Son
is here tonight
Little Cinderella better cook up
something special for him
Lonnie, can you make
your quail tonight
Okay.
You know what I want to have happen? I want
Mel to sit over there next to your father.
- Oh, okay.
- For what?
- Then I'll have all three of my fellows in a row.
- All right, c'mon, c'mon.
Maybe you should take
your plate with you?
- That's all right, I didn't touch it.
- Sit down.
- Do you like quail?
- I never had quail.
Are you all right?
Just don't want to talk about it.
I need to calm down.
- Well, if you do wanna talk about it, I wanna be here for you.
- Thank you.
<i>- Want me to take care of the baby?
- He's fine. He's sleeping.</i>
Um, do you mind
if I take a shower?
- No, I don't care. But could I just have a second?
- Okay.
So, Fritz said you
were a scientist, Richard.
Yeah, I was a chemist for Maple Brothers
in the Bay Area before we came here.
- Right, the aspirin company.
- Yeah.
Decongestants, nasal sprays, all that
consumer crap. I couldn't wait to quit.
He hated it.
- I'm a scientist too.
- No, you're kidding!
- Oh, my God. What's your specialty?
- Entomology.
Isn't that incredible?
The genetic connection.
<i>Oh, my God,
that's incredible.!</i>
<i>For some reason, Lonnie never
seemed to have an interest in science.</i>
- What does that mean?
- She doesn't mean anything.
It means simply that you never had an interest
in science. Look at the other things you do.
Who knows? I might've had
an interest in sculpture...
<i>if these guys
hadn't given me away.</i>
<i>Who knows what might've happen?
- Gimme a kiss.</i>
Yeah, what,
what did happen?
<i>- About what?
- Why did you guys give me up?</i>
Why did we give him away?
<i>- The big question.
- That's the question.</i>
<i>Fritz Boudreau said
that you were indisposed...</i>
<i>- and so that's how he came to bring Mel to the agency.
- Indisposed?</i>
<i>- Is that what he said?
- That's the word Fritz used?</i>
- That would've been nice.
- Big word for the fella.
<i>- I wouldn't mind being indisposed.
- I'm gonna tell the story.</i>
<i>How much detail do you
have to go into here?</i>
I want Mel to know what happened or
he'll never believe we cared about him.
What are you hanging
onto that for?
<i>- You're holding onto it. I'm letting it go.
- I'm not holding onto anything.</i>
<i>You're holding onto these things.
Go ahead, tell 'em. I don't care.</i>
Mel, you know we were
living in San Francisco...
<i>- and it was the mid '60s, right?
- Uh-huh, yeah.</i>
<i>We were part of a progressive group of artists,
and there was one band at the center of it.</i>
A band?
W- What band?
Jerry Garcia,
blah, blah, blah.
<i>I am so sick of this fucking story.!
It is so boring.!</i>
<i>You've been telling it
for years. Give it up.!</i>
It is so boring.
He doesn't like it
when I tell this story.
- What happened with Jerry Garcia?
- Nothing.
<i>- Nothing with Jerry Garcia, but Richard and I went to prison.
- Right after you were born.</i>
- That's why we had to give you away.
- You went to prison?
<i>- Don't be stigmatized by it. It wasn't a serious crime.
- Oh, God, it was nothing.</i>
- Not even a crime.
- It was absolutely nothing. Less than nothing.
Have you ever driven a few miles over
the speed limit or something like that?
<i>- Yeah, sure.
- It was less than that!</i>
<i>If you speed,
you could hurt somebody.</i>
- You were jailed for driving?
- No, no, no. There was no driving.
How did they get that?
I'm sorry,
I'm totally lost.
- Hi.
- Hi.
<i>Here, I'll get out of your way.</i>
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. What did I do?
- It's okay, relax.
- Watch out. You could hurt your fingers.
Whoops.
- I'm so clumsy.
- No, you're not.
You know, I have these three
Italian prints at home that I keep...
I don't know what to do. If I should frame
them myself or take them to somebody else.
- I would take them to the framer.
- Yeah?
- Maybe that's what I'll do.
- Do you want to take a shower?
- No, go ahead.
- I mean together?
Your husband's been taking you for
granted a little bit, don't you think?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Here. Let me go get
my shower cap.
You made L. S. D.?
That's what you're saying?
<i>- Yes, yes. We made acid.
- We gave it out to people who needed it.</i>
You know that there are hundreds of
pharmaceutical executives in this country...
that are selling drugs,
F. D. A. Approved drugs.
<i>- On the open market.
- Over the counter with incredible side...</i>
<i>- Horrible side effects.
- Terrible side effects.</i>
<i>- And these people are not in jail.
- They're not in prison anywhere.</i>
They're in country clubs or playing
golf. They're having drinks.
They're running the country.
Running the country, Mel!
- L. S. D. Shouldn't be a felony in the first place.
- It's not addictive.
It doesn't lead
to violent crime.
<i>It's really the only hope
for the species.</i>
Did you take acid
while you were pregnant with me?
You're not gonna bring
that thing up, are you?
You know the stuff they tell you
about chromosome damage and all that?
- Yeah, I do!
- That's government propaganda.
<i>- Total propaganda.
- Theyjust wanna get ahold of your head, that's all.</i>
I was relieved, though,
when you came out in the hospital...
<i>and you only had one head.</i>
<i>- Very funny.
- She kills me.!</i>
- He was such a cute baby.
- It would've been kinda nice if he had a third eye there.
You know, a third eye is a symbol
of enlightenment.
He's not getting it.
<i>- Mel, identity is nothing but a mental construct.
- Mental construct?</i>
You mustn't fixate on it.
<i>Have you ever read
any Tibetan Buddhism like Chaos theory?</i>
Paul?
- Is he okay?
- Are you okay there, Paul?
Is this
a musical table?
<i>- Is this a musical table?
- Can I get you something?</i>
<i>- I'm not feeling very well.
- What is it? What are you going through?</i>
<i>Do you want to lie down?
Can I get you something?</i>
<i>- How do you feel?
- Vivid.</i>
<i>I'm seeing colors
that I don't want to see.</i>
- He's seeing colors.
- Just go with it. He needs to lie down.
Wait, let me move this. You're gonna
have to help me. Paul, can you hear me?
- Goddamn it! Lonnie!
- Don't fly off the handle.
Come in here. Come here.
What did you do to Paul's quail?
- Nothing. Why?
- Don't give me that fake innocence. What did you do?
I dosed Mel's dish.
I meant it for Mel, and then he ate it.
- Oh, my God. How much?
- Two and a half tabs.
Two and a half tabs?
Are you crazy? Are you nuts?
Doesn't your mother have
enough to worry about tonight?
<i>Why do you have to talk
to me like that?</i>
It's embarrassing to me and I don't
appreciate it in front of him.
I mean, who is he?
You got the whole science thing going...
and the next thing I know you like him
better than me because he's more like you.
We love you very much. Even if you
wereJeffrey Dahmer we would love you.
- I'm not here to take your...
- Spare me the hyp... Please, Mel, please!
Where do you get this insecurity from? I
don't understand it. This drives me nuts!
<i>- Richard, you're criticizing.
- All right, all right.</i>
I want you to apologize to Mel
and to Paul right now. C'mon.
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry for what?
I'm sorry... that I put windowpane in
Mel's quail. And I'm sorry you ate it.
All right, go sit down.
I can't believe he...
<i>Let's not blow this out of proportion.
Paul's gonna come down in about ten hours.</i>
- Ten hours?
- I, I...
I can't believe you're actually keeping acid
in the house after you went to prison for it.
Wait 'til your son is 19. See if
he does everything you want him to do.
<i>This is classic.! Keep blaming it all
on me, all your crap.</i>
<i>You just simmer down, you. And take a
little responsibility for what you've done.</i>
Thank you, Mrs. Cleaver.
<i>Excuse me. I'm sorry.
This is a nonsmoking house.</i>
Are you kidding?
You know, it's been a long day
and I'm really tired.
So I'm gonna hit the hay. Thank you
very much for dinner. It was wonderful.
<i>My love in Paris
knows my secret</i>
- Just go with it.
- He's gonna be fine. She's a great guide.
I'm sure you are
an excellent guide.
Thank you again for this wonderful
evening. It was really great.
- It was great seeing you.
- Yeah. Thanks.
- I loved meeting you.
- I loved meeting you too, and I'm just gonna hit the hay.
Now, you're sure
that you don't want dessert?
I think I'm gonna
lay off the food.
- If you get hungry later, it's in the fridge, okay?
- Will do.
Chocolate mousse. You're gonna love it.
Very nice to meet you.
- Tina, good night, dear.
- Go with it, Paul.
I guess it's just one of those ex-felon,
pro-acid kind of nonsmoking homes.
It's a weird, weird home.
And where's Nancy? Where is she?
She's somewhere in one of these
rooms with Tony. They're in there...
Mel, you need to settle down. This is
overwhelming. This is hitting you all at once.
You know what, sweetheart? Just come in
here for a second. We'll sit down, cool off.
Boy!
Oh, boy!
Well, you know,
what did I expect, right?
I'm sorry this is all
hitting you at the same time...
but after it passes and things settle
down, you can think about starting over.
- Why can't you just use soap?
- Soap dries your skin out.
Not that I'm one of those women who obsesses
about old-looking skin after pregnancy.
I just happen to be
obsessing about it right now.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- You're absolutely right. We don't need to rush into this.
I haven't even finalized
my divorce yet.
No, I could've kissed you
and felt okay about it, but I didn't.
And I felt really wrong.
Don't take this personally...
but with all your nervous energy,
you kinda remind me of my mother.
Ow!
- Do you mind if I look at your armpit?
- My armpit?
It's my favorite part
of a woman's body.
- What's attractive?
- Are you kidding? Lots of things.
Look at this, the definition.
Look at the contours.
The depth of the pocket.
Feel that? So nice!
- Of course I feel rejected.
- I'm sorry.
But I shouldn't. You're not
an appropriate partner for me.
Your life's a mess, and you don't make
enough money anyway.
That's a really
nasty thing to say.
You just told me
I reminded you of your mother.
Well, I mean, she's a good person.
She's got a lot of great qualities.
I don't want to wreck your marriage.
I know how painful that can be.
My marriage is obviously
vulnerable at this point.
Every marriage is vulnerable, otherwise being
married wouldn't mean anything, would it?
I need to see Tony.
- No, I want you to tell me if you have a favorite animal.
- Oh, that's so stupid.
Listen to what Mary says. She's
a great guide. Okay? Just listen to her.
- Okay. A dog.
- A dog.
<i>- What is your favorite dog?
- A collie... St. Bernard.</i>
I want you to picture a big, furry
St. Bernard curled by the fireplace.
- Can I change my mind?
- No, we're gonna stick with the St. Bernard.
- I want do to a Springer Spaniel.
- It doesn't have to be the perfect dog.
- Dalmatian.
- No, no.
Okay, Dalmatian.
Now, this dog represents security...
- Schnauzer. Schnauzer.
- What?
Shut the fuck up! I am trying
to help you. Do you understand me?
- C'mon, sweetheart, you're so good. Just relax.
- Paul! Paul!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
Can we stop
all this craziness, huh?
Yes! I wasn't even
enjoying that.
- It seems like you were enjoying it.
- The attention, maybe.
<i>Okay, all right.
Time for you to go.</i>
You haven't been treating her very well.
Do you know that?
You know what, buddy?
You got a lot of nerve.
You come in here,
you lick my wife's armpit.
I'm gonna have that image in my head
for the rest of my life...
- of your tongue in there.
- You deserve it.
- This is felonious and I want to make an arrest.
- Shh.
- What? What did he say?
- He's tripping his brains out.
- He said arrest. We don't know who he is.
- He's Mel's friend Paul.
- I know exactly who I am. I'm Paul Harmon.
- Good.
- Bureau ofTobacco, Tobacco, and Tobacco.
- Good.
- What is this, Paul?
- It is a badge.
- What kind of badge?
- I'm a Special Agent man.
Twenty years in the service.
Graduated fourth in my class.
- Is this a joke?
- I don't joke about those things.
Goddamn it. I knew it was weird. When
they called out of the blue, I knew.
- No, you had to see your son.
- He's kidding.
<i>He's making a joke. He's... Oh.</i>
- You're not kidding.
- I am not kidding. Everything is under control.
I want you to both move over
against that wall. This is an arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.
<i>If you cannot afford an attorney,
we will provide an attorney for you...</i>
because we provide things
for you people all the...
Oh!
That really hurt.
I can't follow your fickle
little moods all over the place.
- That has got to change.
- Okay, I will. I promise.
If you just give me a chance.
Let me show you I can be less selfish.
I will show you.
You will get concrete results.
You have got to earn that back
with some consistent behavior, pal.
<i>I'm sorry I acted this way.
I'm sorry I've treated you this way.</i>
<i>I've got to be out of my mind
to risk losing you.</i>
- You don't hit another human being!
- My...
Just shut the hell up!
Just be quiet.
All right, nobody heard us
upstairs. We're all right.
- We have to get him to a doctor.
- There's no doctor. Forget the doctor.
I've gotta think of what
we're gonna do. Just give me a minute.
- Paul, wake up. Wake up, Paul.
- I'm not goin' back to jail.
You know where I'm goin'? I'm goin'
to Mexico. We're all goin' to Mexico.
<i>- And we're taking him as a hostage.
- A hostage?</i>
<i>- Cool!
- What are you talking about?</i>
I'm not going to jail again. You
understand me? I'm not going to jail!
This has to be a mistake.
Mel wouldn't do this to us.
How do you know who Mel is?
Mel is probably in on this.
How do you know it's our son? It's not
our son. It's some fucking Federal agent!
<i>- Goddamn it.
- I know it's our son. You think a mother doesn't know?</i>
Just shut up and listen.
We take him in the car.
We're gonna go to San Miguel to Stuart's
place. We can be there by morning.
<i>- Grab his foot.
- Wake up. No! I am not walking away from a home...</i>
<i>it took us 20 years
to put together.!</i>
This is insane.
We can't take him hostage.
- This is a much bigger crime.
- What'll we do with him?
- Dump him in the brush.
- Brush! Good, good.
- Leave him and get outta here.
- Lonnie, go clean out the lab.
<i>Don't break anything.!</i>
No, no.
Wait a minute.
Shit! This truck
is not going to make it to Mexico.
- What are we...
- Oh, shit!
Put it in here.
My sciatica is killing me.
Would've been here an hour ago
if you'd listened to me.
<i>It took two hours to find that there's
no place to get a good sandwich here.</i>
You can't keep making U-turns
in the middle of the highway...
- even if you see what looks like a sandwich shop.
- Let's get this over with.
Eddie, wait. Don't.
What's the matter?
Come on!
- I can't go in there.
- Why not?
- Look at this house.
- What's the matter with it?
It's so...
all-American.
- It's...
- What are you talking about?
They're probably quiet,
reasonable, sensible people...
and Mel loves them, and, you
know, we're a source of embarrassment.
But he's in trouble
and that's why we came!
It's possible
I overreacted.
- Now you think you overreacted?
- Yeah.
We just got off an airplane. We drove
five and a half hours in the desert...
I am not going in there to be rejected
in front of his new parents!
- Yes, you are!
- No, I'm not. Let go of me. You're hurting my arm.
Get in the car
before they hear us.
- I thought we were gonna eat here. I'm starving.
- We'll go back to the taco place.
- Tacos have cheese in them.
- Not all tacos have cheese in them.
- Wait, is this our car?
- Of course it's our car.
- Do you remember this truck?
- Do you have early Alzheimer's? It's a white rental...
<i>- Where's the car?
- It's over here. What's the matter with you?</i>
<i>- Why did you move it?
- I thought you moved it.</i>
Why would I move it?
What are we taking that car for?
I wanna take the blue truck.
We can't take the truck.
The truck can't make an 800-mile trip.
I want my blue truck.
My water broke in that truck.
Get in the car.
I love you. Get in the car.
Are you sure
all your doubting is over?
Sorry I took you for granted.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I want to go home tomorrow.
So do I!
I want to get out of here.
Slow down.
There's the taco place.
<i>- Why didn't you tell me you saw it?
- I did tell you.</i>
You were driving too fast.
You can't make U-turns like this, Eddie.
- Relax, we're in the middle of nowhere.
- The sign, the sign!
The car!
Damn tourists!
What did I just tell you
about the U-turns?
- He was in my blind spot.
- You could fit the state of Wisconsin in your blind spot.
- It's their fault.
- Doesn't matter. I don't want some sheriff to come.
- Where's the acid?
- It's in the trunk.
Look, if things get tight, why don't
you do that spastic colon thing you do?
- No, I'm not gonna do spastic colon.
- Something.
That thing you did when the cops
stopped us in Albuquerque.
That ulcer thing.
- Okay... I'll do reflux.
- All right. That's good.
<i>- I am so sorry!
- Are you all right?</i>
Yeah, we're fine. You can't
just make a blind U-turn like that!
I've got a sizable
blind spot, is my problem.
- I don't see much damage.
- It looks mostly cosmetic.
- It's nothing. Why don't we just forget about it, all right?
- No.
We shouldn't leave the scene of an accident.
I'll call the police from the taco place.
You can call the police if you want, but
I'll tell you this is your fault here.
We make a report, your insurance
rates are gonna go sky-high.
<i>- It's up to you, but I don't see the point of it.
- Pearl, he's making sense.</i>
No! I have never broken the law.
I am not gonna be irresponsible now.
- There's nothing irresponsible about this.
- We're all fine.
You can see that
we're perfectly okay.
I just have this preexisting
medical condition.
My ileocecal valve
doesn't work as it should.
It allows corrosive juices...
They seem to rise into my esophagus...
<i>and I...
I need to get home...</i>
so that I can lie down...
- We really have to go.
- With my head elevated.
- Ileocecal valve?
- It's chronic.
<i>- Nice meeting you.
- Why did you let them get away?</i>
We're better off.
Who knows what our liability is?
Yes! What exactly is
our deductible damage waiver?
Here. Oh, my God,
the car...
- It's registered to Mel!
- What?
Look at... Check and see if our luggage
is in the trunk.
<i>Huh?</i>
What the hell is this?
<i>Sometimes the light's
all shining on me</i>
<i>Other times
I can barely see</i>
<i>So then what happened?</i>
I don't know where anybody is.
Look at this place, it's a wreck.
I see the place. I'm looking for him,
and I can't find him. Where...
They probably took him
to the hospital. He was...
They didn't take him
to the hospital. Paul!
Oh, my God!
<i>Truckin'
I'm a-going home</i>
You can't catch the wind!
<i>- Jerry?
- Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>- Jerry Garcia Jerry?
- Yeah.!</i>
It's in the family.
It's got a whole history to it.
<i>You don't even like
the Grateful Dead.</i>
<i>I never said I don't like them. I just
haven't listened to that much of their music.</i>
Unless you
still like Ethan.
This is obviously much more important
to you than it is to me.
<i>Okay?
So you pick the name.</i>
<i>But I'll say one thing.
I think Jerry is very pedestrian.</i>
How 'bout Garcia?
<i>- Garcia?
- Garcia Coplin.</i>
<i>Garcia! Garcia Coplin.</i>
<i>- Look, he likes it.
- I like it too. Garcia Coplin.</i>
<i>- Garcia.
- Yeah.</i>
<i>- You think I should get that?
- Sure.</i>
Hello?
"Shit... " "ShitKings... "
- Schlichting.
- Schlichting's residence.
<i>- What kind of trouble are you in?
- Us? You're the ones in jail.</i>
There were drugs in the trunk of your car.
Why are there drugs in the trunk of your car?
<i>How did you get our car?</i>
We tracked you to the "Shitkings"
because we thought you were in trouble.
- Why did you think we were in trouble?
- Because of the phone call.
The truck and the baby.
No, Ma. I was talking to that
evil dwarf woman at the B-and-B.
- We weren't in trouble.
- Your mother as usual has overreacted.
I did not overreact!
If I overreacted...
why am I wearing handcuffs
in the middle of a jail?
There's obviously been some mishap, sir.
These people are not drug runners.
Look at them. They're from New York.
They're my parents.
You hear that, Eddie?
He called us his parents.
Of course you're my parents.
Mom...
Oh, Mel!
- Ow, Mom, your chain's pulling my hair.
- Wait a minute.
Sorry, darling.
<i>Bobby, take these forms back
to the office, these release forms.</i>
And get these nice people their
car keys. This is all over here.
This is a Federal Agent and he just told
me the whole story about the "Shleektings. "
- "Shitkings. "
- No, Schlichtings.
Well, anyway, it's clear
that we have the wrong people here.
That's what I've been trying to tell
this guy for the last half hour.
And by the way,
why are you not wearing pants?
<i>- I had an experience. That's why.
- What do you mean?</i>
I resisted at first, and then it evolved
and it continues to evolve for me.
I don't know what the hell he's talking
about, but I got some jewelry somewhere.
Sure, let me get
those cuffs.
<i>We may be able to work out a private adoption
through some people I know in Colorado.</i>
- How long will that take?
- Usually six months to a year.
But if you're willing to wait, I may be
able to find lesbians willing to conceive...
- Lesbians are good.
- And then you could share the baby with them.
- No? Why?
- I'm not gonna do that.
- I think these two are homosexuals.
- They want to adopt. That's so sick!
Can you image the neurosis
that child would be exposed to?
Okay, here we go.
Everyone, pull together. Paul, smile.
<i>One, two.!</i>
<i>Whoo-ee</i>
Are you okay?
<i>Through this barren desert</i>
<i>In search of truth
and some pointy boots</i>
<i>And maybe
a few snack crackers</i>
Oh.
All right.
All right.
Why do we have
to baby-sit tonight?
Come on, come on. Ahh, yes.
- Because the kids need some time alone.
- The kids need time alone?
Yes! God, Eddie,
where's your sense of romance?
<i>Who's in charge here</i>
I can't. I can't.
It's making me too nervous.
He made you nervous when he was
in the other room. Come on.
- You both make me nervous.
Is that my beeper?
No. Let's get this beeper
and this gun out of here.
<i>Wanna walk
like a camel</i>
<i>Whoo-ee</i>
It's a blind date. I don't know.
Some benefit or something.
No. I am not smoking, Mother.
Look, I gotta go. He's here.
Yeah, he knows. Uh-huh.
Yeah, I know.
I'll call you tomorrow. Uh-huh.
Pain in my ass!
I'm coming!
<i>Hey, you don't think
there's any way</i>
<i>I could get that quarter from
underneath of your pointy boot, do you</i>
<i>- Shalom, shalom.
- Shalom.</i>
<i>Shalom. Deeper.</i>
<i>You guys, this place sucks.
Everybody speaks Spanish.</i>
- Did you ever hear of knocking?
- What are you looking for?
- I'm looking for some weed.
- No, you find your own weed.
- Get out of that drawer.
- Guys, I'm totally bored here.
Honey, it takes time to make
new friends. Be patient.
<i>Hey, you don't think
there's any way</i>
<i>I could get that quarter from
underneath of your funny boot, do you</i>
<i>All I want is
just one more oatmeal pie</i>
<i>Whoo-ee</i>
<i>Little Debbie, little Debbie
I'm a-comin'on home, baby</i>
<i>'Cause you make me
wanna walk</i>
<i>Like a camel</i>
<i>Whoo-ee</i>
<i>I sing a song 'bout
clouds and rainbows</i>
<i>I hum a tune
that sings like a dove</i>
<i>Found some words
'bout anything</i>
<i>Anything but love</i>
<i>I paint a picture
of my prison</i>
<i>With blue and gray
from the sky above</i>
<i>Framed and signed
with the title</i>
<i>Anything but love</i>
<i>He had to go
but I won't miss him</i>
<i>I've got better things
to do</i>
<i>Like writing stories
and painting pictures</i>
<i>Of anything but love</i>
<i>Anything but love</i>
<i>Anything but love</i>
<i>It's a terrible predicament</i>
<i>That we're in again</i>
