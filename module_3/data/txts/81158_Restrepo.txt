All right, this is what's going on.
Me, O'Bizzle - O'Bizzle.
- l got it, l got it, man l'm the narrator.
- O'Bizzle fo' shizzle.
Me, Peebs, and Kim.
Kim, you got something to say?
- Yeah, you got something to say.
- Kim?
You all know tonight
is going to going to be crazy.
Stupid crazy.
What's your sole mission, O'Byrne?
Man, to keep you out of hand.
You can't -you can't tame the beast.
Peebs, tell them. How do we roll?
Got 'em. Got 'em.
Tune in next time
where we're going to be still loving life
and getting ready to go to war.
- What?
- All right, baby.
- War, Afghanistan, what?
- Say it again, baby, say it again.
- l didn't even sign my passport.
- Baby.
- l didn't even sign my passport.
- We're going to war. We're going to war.
We're going to war. We're going to war.
Roger.
Oh, we're fucking hit.
- This is an IED, over.
- IED.
- Keep going, keep going! Keep
- What was that?
- Shots.
- Eight o'clock.
- Get on that gun!
- What are we doing?
Aim for that draw! Right now!
That way.
We gotta get out. We gotta get out of here.
We're getting out!
Fucking motherfucker.
Shot, eight o'clock. 300 meters.
Shot, eight o'clock. 102 meters.
You know what?
When they told me
l was going to the Korengal Valley,
l really didn't, uh, l didn't read
anything up on it. l didn't want to.
l wanted to go in there with an open mind.
The Colonel told me initially
they take fire every single day.
l was like, God, how the hell do you take
fire every single day from somebody?
You got to go out there and go kill
the damn enemy.
Quit being, you know, scared.
Go out there and get 'em.
And the Colonel and l
came up with, you know,
what we thought was going to be
our campaign plan and that, uh,
after two months of being there l would fix
it and that we wouldn't get shot at anymore.
The very first day, l remember coming in,
and one of the pilots and stum,
and they said, hey,
if you look over there to your left,
uh, that's Pakistan.
You know, and we're like, you know,
we all, okay, that's Pakistan.
And then they're all mountains,
you know, high elevation.
And as you go in elevation,
it starts to get a little bit colder.
And then we go up into the Korengal Valley.
l remember looking out the little bubble
windows on the side, kind of just like this,
because l was right next to the window.
And l could see when the Chinook
had made a hard right turn into the valley.
l was like, holy shit.
We're not ready for this.
We flew around for about half- hour,
45 minutes above the KOP,
and you're just looking down there,
and you're like,
this is in the middle of nowhere right now.
You're away from everything.
Honestly, when l first got to the Korengal,
l was like, this is a shit hole.
My mindset was like, oh snap,
l'm going to die here.
l remember getting om the bird
and walking up the hill to the hooch.
Hey, Jones, you guys standing up
right there, you're wrong.
Come on, guys, better get moving.
And just sucking...
and thinking what are we doing?
lt started getting dark,
and monkeys were howling,
And l thought they were Taliban.
And l thought, holy shit they're close.
Everybody's like,
oh, you're going to the Korengal?
And they feel sorry for you
and everything like that.
l'm like, dude,
it can't be that bad, you know?
l show up there
and you're burning your own feces.
You know, you're living in a tent.
l literally lived in a bunker, you know,
about that high, l couldn't even stand up in.
See bullet holes all rattled into the Hescos
and when you look up, it's like,
l don't even know why l have Hescos here
because they're not going to stop the bullets
that are coming down from the mountains.
So l felt like l was
l was like fish in a barrel.
They're gathering intel right now,
basically, on how to deal with us,
because they haven't
there's no really research or intel
on how to treat us right now,
because they haven't had to deal with people
like us since World War Il and Vietnam,
you know, dealing with guys that are
coming back from 15-month deployments
with as much fighting,
you know, as we went through.
Hey, go on that ridgeline, fucking now!
Hey, roger, l'm up here by OP four.
We're scanning and if we have to,
we'll move into contact.
l got myself, Riegel, and Thomas over here.
Roger, over.
Hey, l'm about to find this bastard,
and l'm going to kill him, over.
Okay, roger.
So it's coming from 1705 and 00.
We should be firing on those here
right now, break.
Hang it!
Fire! Firing!
The Korengal Outpost is at the 6-3 gridline,
and then the 6-2 gridline
the insurgency has, like, drawn
this imaginary line in the sand there,
and every time the guys
come out of Firebase Phoenix
and they cross the 6-2 gridline,
l mean, like, no shit, every time they cross
the 6-2 gridline, they get in contact.
So l want to extend the security bubble,
because wherever l can place troops
and wherever l can provide security
is where l'm going to be able to
have an influence on the populace.
The hard part is, is that they're so deeply
rooted down here because of family ties
and because of religious ideals, that getting
these people to push out the insurgency
and basically push out their family members
is going to be the hard part.
Right now the road ends
at the Korengal Outpost,
and where the road ends
is where the Taliban begins.
We've been getting reports that they've been
watching us throughout the day,
so the contact right now
l'd say is likely or imminent.
- Good to see you.
- Move southeast. It's this way.
Do you want chai?
We don't have time to sit down
and have chai tonight.
l just wanted to come in and talk to you
briefly about the project.
How many people are you actually
going to use to build the project?
What's up?
You see that last house, to the right of it?
Brownish fucking bush
about fucking 15, 20 meters to the right?
Yeah?
Someone turned around that corner
saw us and went right back around, du'de.
We're going to be moving in darkness.
You're going to be lead, so...
We could move now if you need to.
Okay, spread out.
l'm pushing up here.
Whoa, a tracer came right by here!
Hey!
There's fire coming. They're shooting.
Over there!
Where? Over where?
Tell me, sir, tell me.
Kim!
The first friend l lost was Vimoto,
and that was right at the beginning
of the deployment. That hit hard.
And then a month after that, l lost Restrepo.
The day that Restrepo got killed,
it came across the net
that we had troops in contact.
Then they called back in
and said that we have a casualty.
l need you to give me fire, Cortez.
We didn't know who it was, because nobody
was saying anything over the radio.
When you hear someone's hit,
your first reaction
is just like, fuck, like, no.
And then you start going through your head
all the people that you know out there
and wanting to eliminate your friends
and the people that were closest to you
you know, not this guy.
Not this guy. Not this guy.
You know, your heart just sank.
You were like, fuck.
l mean, it was Doc Restrepo.
He was shot in the neck twice...
but he was stable,
so that was a relief for us.
We say, okay, he's going to be okay,
because we looked at him.
when he gets on the aircraft,
he's still breathing.
But he, it hit his, um, artery in his neck,
and he bled out.
He bled out on the helicopter ride
to the emergency room
where they take you when you get shot.
- This is the big danger area right now.
- Okay.
Because if we're here
and they start opening up on us...
You're in between.
But if we clear down, you guys could
use my weapons squad as an indicator
for where they are,
and that's your right limit of fire, man.
Shoot anything up the mountain.
l would say since we haven't been down here
and we don't know what's in here,
l'm going to fucking assume the worst,
because it's near Kalaygal,
and that they have fortified fighting
positions throughout here.
Okay.
What were we doing in the Korengal?
Our purpose in the Korengal
they had a road,
and the intent was this road to go through
the Korengal and go out to Chowkay Valley
to be able to connect the locals
where they can have an easy route
up towards the Pech River Valley.
And our job there was to try
to sustain the security for the personnel,
to allow them to build that road.
You know, five, ten years from now,
the Korengal Valley is going to have
a road going through it that's paved.
And we can make more money,
make you guys richer,
make you guys more powerful.
What l need though,
is l need you to join with the government,
you know, provide us with that security
or help us provide you guys
with that security.
And l'll flood this whole place
with money and with projects
and with healthcare and with everything.
Remember last week when we said that
everything that happened in the past
when Captain McKnight was here
we're kind of, like, wiping the slate clean.
Captain Kearney's got a new slate.
Let's put it behind, and let's get on
with what we've got to do now.
Growing up in Oregon, l wasn't allowed
to have sugar 'til l was, like, 13,
because my mom was a fucking hippie.
And she's always have us doing, like,
little hippie children things, l guess
making, like, homemade paper or painting
something or going, like, on nature walks.
lt was a nice childhood.
l just wasn't allowed to have toy guns
or anything like that,
like boys should have, l guess
little toy guns or, like, violent video games
or watch any violent movies at all.
Like l had a toy squirt gun that was
a turtle, and my parents took it away
because it said ''squirt gun''
it had ''gun'' on there.
Fire!
Right now priority...
For the first few months of the deployment...
we'd get rocked hard. They'd hit us from...
They'd ambush us at 360 degrees.
l remember thinking, you know, holy shit,
did everybody from the entire country
come to this valley?
ls nobody else fighting anymore?
Is every bad guy in my face?
Oh, shit!
Motherfuckers.
ln the entire country of Afghanistan,
we dropped something close
to 70 percent of all the ordinance.
All the bombs that were dropped
at that particular time
were dropped in the Korengal Valley.
As CNN dubbed it one day
when Bush saw it
and said, you know,
the ugliest place on Earth
the Korengal Valley.
But to my family,
l never really told them much
until about halmay into the deployment.
l didn't tell them when Vimoto died.
l didn't tell them
when Sergeant Padilla lost his arm.
l didn't tell them when Pisec got shot.
l didn't tell them when Restrepo got killed.
And then when Restrepo got killed was
a few days before my mom's birthday also.
So l had to... l had to suck it up
when l called my mom on her birthday
and act like everything was okay and say
''Hey, Mom, happy birthday,'' you know,
like, ''Yeah, l am doing really good out here,
everything's fine.''
The change came when we in OP Restrepo.
ln the middle of the night we put up
a firebase on top of the place
that they had used as their enemy kinetic,
you know, point of attack,
or of origin of their attack,
for the last 15 months.
We walked up the Spur
with shovels and picks.
We worked all though the night just
to make a small semicircle to chill in.
We slept for maybe a couple hours each,
started doing it again.
That day we got in five, seven firefights.
Everybody good?
- Yeah, we're gonna
- Yeah!
We'd dig. They'd shoot at us.
They'd see us digging,
building this new place. They'd shoot.
We'd shoot back. Once it lulled down,
we started digging again.
When the boys built that base,
the Taliban, or the AAF forces in the valley,
they were completely in shock.
lt was like a middle finger sticking out.
And they realized once they could not knock
om OP Restrepo, we had the upper hand.
They started becoming afraid.
Eat some, turban head!
Hey, hit the bottom right.
Hit the bottom right of the village.
- Get this!
- Bottom right. Go right more.
Hey, Solo, that's you.
l'm not shooting over everybody.
- Let's go, let's go!
- He's down in the draw!
- He's down in the draw.
- Down in the draw.
How close?
Buno, get your coms up.
Make sure you got fucking SAW
and a .203 with you.
- You're taking Wilson, Cortez.
- Cortez.
Don't worry, l'll...
Don't worry. There's very few
that l just straight up hope don't make it.
A month or two into it, it was still
a shitty place. We were covered in dirt,
digging all the time, getting in firefights,
like four or five firefights a day.
And so we -the majority of us really didn't
feel like it should be called OP Restrepo.
it was just a shitty place. It was just...
lt just didn't resemble
the type of person that he was.
Scuming up my notes.
Feels like longer than forever, yeah
My home is now a distant land
lf l had one wish, l wish l could be
Back on that rock
in the middle of the sea
My heart is calling me to the islands
Blue skies and tropical breeze
l want to go back home
Swim in the Pacific sea
You can take the boy from the island
But not the island from the boy
The island stays in your heart
l'll never forget where l'm from
Oh, no, l'll never forget
Where l'm from
Sir. How you doing, sir?
Good to see you again.
Good seeing you again.
Welcome to the KOP.
l'd like to take you up over there, sir,
maybe just try to give you
the once over the world here.
This is the southern Korengal.
This is, uh, l guess you could call it,
this is the war zone.
This is where it's all happening.
This is where the majority of the population
of the Korengal lives
and probably about 90% of the fighting.
lf you look just to the south here
to that third spur that you see down there,
which is called Honcho Hill, that is like
the enemy -l guess you could say
limit of advance for us.
Like, we can't go
any further south than that.
- What do you call it -Honcho?
- Honcho Hill.
- Honcho Hill.
- You follow that spur,
and you go all the way up here,
Sergeant Major,
- and you might be able to see that
- The tip of the...
that top of the OP.
You can see all the bee huts and stum.
That's OP Restrepo.
Everything south of that
is the enemy sanctuary.
Battle 6, Battle 2-5
l have around 15 up near R'estrepo.
Nothing out of the ordinary as far
as movement in the southwest today.
Nothing but women and children
out tending to the fields and crops.
Enemy assessment -we've got the AAF
are in the final stages to start their attack
and moving and getting everything in place.
Last 24, conduct a movement
to contact into Loy Kalay,
separate the AAF from the populace
in order to spread new lO themes.
Hey, Cunningham, on a side note,
how's the fam?
How's the what?
- The fam.
- The family?
Billy.
Good. They're pretty good.
Were they happy to see your crazy self?
Yeah, yeah, it was a good time, man.
Got to hang out at the ranch
and everything like that, you know?
Got to see pretty much everyone
in the family almost.
Your family owns a ranch?
Of course.
Like cows and pigs and chickens
and horses ranch?
No.
Like what kind of ranch, then?
lt's like a ranch
just with like land, you know,
with gates and stum and trucks and whatnot.
Some guns, some wildlife,
you know, that you shoot at.
Okay, so it's just a whole bunch of land
that they kill stum on.
Yeah. It's kind of like this.
Yeah, but we're not hunting animals,
we're hunting people.
Hearts and minds.
Fucking feed tray.
Yeah. We'll take their hearts,
and we'll take their minds.
All right, listen up. Today we're going
to conduct a movement to contact.
The purpose is to talk to the locals
about some lO themes,
as far as the road construction team
coming in.
Get some workers from their village
to take part in that.
Talk about the cow incident.
- Also...
- It was delicious.
Talk about anything out of the ordinary
as far as AAF moving in through their area.
See if they can give us
any information on that.
Anyone have any questions?
Guys, it's gonna suck, but l'm going
to work you guys into the ground.
l need you guys to go out there
and do a patrol in the village
because l need you to keep
the enemy om his toes.
l need you to go out there
and push the enemy back
so we can buy some white space,
so you guys can go back up there
and work your asses om
filling up these sandbags
so that you guys, when do get hit,
you get hit but you got
something to hide behind.
And the best defense is
who has the greater omense.
3-3-4.
6-1-4-9.
Elevation 1-5-7-9.
And we are set in Koringal.
What's your father do?
A shepherd? What do you do?
Are you a shepherd, too?
Let me see your hands.
Your hands.
He's got pretty clean hands
for being a goat herder.
Where'd you get that watch, man?
You guys got a lot of goats?
60 goats.
60 goats?
That's pretty wealthy, right, Abdul?
Yeah.
Well, what do you know about
the people in Kalaygal?
He says...
Roger, we haven't found
anybody else to talk to.
We're going to start pushing back now.
Hey, 2-2, this is Bravo 1.
Start pushing out towards the trail.
Oh, fuck.
What have they got?
Oh, l guess a guy running.
- A guy running?
- Yeah.
Hey, Liz!
Lookit. See?
We've seen a guy run from that house
once or twice before.
l just don't like the way it is.
l don't like how it feels right now.
You want him watching towards
the village or down in the draw?
- Towards the back side of the house.
- Watch the back side of the house.
Hey!
Sit down.
Sit down.
They found a BDU top.
l've got eyes on it right now, over.
Hey, keep on searching
this whole house. Search.
Yeah, yeah, like this, good. Okay.
Who does this belong to?
Never mind.
Hey...
''lf l go with you,
l'm not going to go with you right now.
- l will come back to the KOP.''
- No, no, he's going -he's coming with us.
This guy, he was already at the house.
This guy came up later, saw us,
and starting taking om running.
l got him, and ever since he started doing
what he's doing now.
Hey, tell these guys l'm gonna sit them
in my truck, they need to sit on their hands.
Right now what we're tracking
came in the valley on April the 11th.
There's fifteen 107-milimeter rockets,
several cases of PKM and AK ammo.
The fear is always there,
especially at night when you can't
see what's coming at you.
When we started there, we only had
maybe fourteen guys up there.
l mean, it doesn't take much.
A few automatic weapons will keep,
you know, a squad pinned down,
while they could easily come up
from a side and flank you
and, you know, go basically clear house.
Nobody's going to help you.
You're in no man's land.
The KOP is only seven hundred,
eight hundred meters away,
but that might as well be
in a dimerent country
because they're not getting to you.
Not in time.
KOP's taking indirect right now.
KOP's taking indirect.
Can't see shit what they're doing.
Day sight. It's something.
Better than anything else we got.
l need more fucking 240 here!
One's by Karingal, the other's by Dallas.
Right up there.
The birds we love.
Okay, roger, he's pretty much worked
the Honcho Hill ridge.
Want to push him southeast up to 3-0,
just southeast of that.
Big firefight, great.
Fucking packing up rounds.
That was fun, though, man, that was fun.
You can't get a better high.
lt's like crack, you know?
You can sky dive or bungee jump
or do, you know, kayak,
but once you've been shot at,
you really can't come down.
There's nothing, you can't top that.
How are you going to go back
to the civilian world then?
l have no idea.
Hey, did you hear me go cyclic?
- l had the barrel smoked!
- Did you hear me?
Yeah, what the fuck was that first
batch about, cuz?
You was crazy as shit with that.
Hey, soon as l popped my head up,
holy - Guess who.
And you just slid down the stairs.
- Common game planning. l was like...
- Get down!
The flight path over...
He's an excellent cook,
by far the best cook in the Korengal,
definitely.
Came up to Restrepo one time,
cooked us fresh cow,
same-day cow.
That was a good day.
Jonesie, you want another grill, man?
You all right?
No, l don't like to fuck on a full stomach.
Dude, we're on TV.
Come in here for the real thing.
Don't fight it, don't fight it.
Why don't they mess
with you anymore, man?
l was one of the first ones
that got messed with to begin with.
Well, look at him, look how sexy he is.
l mean, look at this guy.
He's a beautiful man.
l'd fuck him back in the States.
Let's talk about the road
between Omar and Kandalay.
What guy?
Who did we detain?
He says that you detain a guy.
Haji Se, Haji Se.
Naiim was dropped om
by another local in Kalaygal
who told us that he was bad
and that he was working with Sadikula
in the
what the fuck is Sadikula
in charge of, Rudy, the Mujahadeen?
Yeah, he's working with the Muj.
And, he was working
with the Mujahadeen.
l told you guys from the very get go
that if somebody says that they're bad,
l have to investigate it.
So now NDS is talking to him.
He's not in jail.
He's not being treated bad,
he's being talked to
and asked questions.
l think we've been pretty upfront
about how we handle people
that we talk to and question.
We've been pretty fair.
l'm not like Jim McKnight
where l take all these guys
and stick them in Bagram
and they never come back.
He says were happy you're here,
you're doing very well,
but he's saying that you detained
Mohammed Youssef before,
now Mohammed Youssef
didn't come back.
Rudy, who the fuck
is Mohammed Youssef?
Mohammed Kalam's son,
the guy that cut the worker's heads om.
That's because l saw the video
where he cut their heads om.
l saw him do it.
l saw him with my own two eyes.
You're not understanding
that l don't fucking care.
And the thing that's sad to me is that as
much as Captain Kearney go down there
and conduct dimerent Shuras
and tell them about the positives
about what we can do to help them,
it seemed like it didn't go anywhere.
You know?
It seemed like everything that he-
We took one step foward
and it seemed like
they took two steps backwards.
We've got three village elders
just come down and they want to talk.
Not sure what they want
to talk about yet.
lt's a good sign.
lt's the first time it's happened
up here at OP Restrepo.
We've had people come in
elders come in and say before
that they wanted to provide some information,
but never shown up to us,
you know, come back and talk to us.
So this is a positive sign.
Do you hear about the cow that
- The cow?
- Yeah, the US soldiers kill it.
- They killed
- Yeah.
So they came because of that.
They want to get information
about the cow that
He is the owner of cow.
All right, the cow?
The reason why we killed it
because it ran into our constantine wire
and it was mangled
inside the constantine wire,
so we had to kill it
to put it out of its misery
because if we would have got it out,
it would have been useless.
- That's why we killed it.
- They are asking because it was illegal.
- Illegal?
- Yeah, illegal.
- To kill it?
- Yeah.
- What do you want to do?
- Just tell them.
What do they want us
to do about the cow?
Do they want to be
reimbursed somehow or
He says that it is up to you,
if you want to pay money for that or
How much does a cow cost?
lt's going to be like four
or five hundred dollars,
which is going to be twenty,
twenty five thousand Afghani, over.
Did we kill this cow?
Well, it was tangled up in a wire,
pretty much dead.
324 ended up cutting it up. Over.
We're not going to be able
to give him money in exchange for his cow.
But what we can give him
is the rice, the beans, the sugar.
Now, the HA that they will receive
is going to be, you know,
the weight of the cow.
Whatever the weight of the cow was
will be the weight of return of HA
as far as rice, beans, sugar.
- Is that good?
- They want money.
We're not going to be able
to give them the money.
lf that's all he came for
he's not going to get it#
626 perstat, l have 20 at Restrepo,
15at the KOP, 4 at OP1,
4 on leave,
6 ANA and one terp
at Restrepo, break.
Talk louder, nobody
can hear you down here, over.
626 perstat,
l have 20 at Restrepo,
15 at the KOP,
4at OP1,
4 on leave,
1 photo journalist,
6 ANA, and 1 terp
l didn't know they had algebra two.
Yeah! Burning the poop!
Got the black man
on the burning the poop detail.
Hey, man, just watch yourself, God damn it.
Second platoon killed that cow
and now l gotta pay for it.
l still wanna see Spanky
and Vaughn go at it.
- Vaughn would fucking destroy Spanky.
- Let's go get him.
Vaughn!
Vaughn, you're going
to beat Spanky's ass!
He's coming up here,
you better not lose.
Dude, if you lose, so help me God.
lt's going to reflect poorly
on me if you lose.
You better not let
that cherry bitch beat you.
Make him tough.
Get him, get him.
- Vaughn.
- What's up, dude?
- Come on, fight back!
- You're such a little bitch.
All right, go ahead.
- Stretch them out.
- What the fuck, Spanky?
You gonna let him
fucking manhandle you?
- Let him get tired.
- Flip over, man.
Yeah, there you go!
Nice, there you go.
You suck!
