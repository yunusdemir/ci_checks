Hey!
It's her. The Ridgeway girl.
Nice.
Some of us have to
work for a living.
Daisy!
Back in the line.
Welcome to Wode Hall,
Miss Ridgeway.
We all hope you will
be very happy here.
Thank you, Barnstaple.
I know I shall.
Perhaps, you would care
to meet the staff, Miss?
Later.
I want to see what progress
we've made with the grounds.
The architect
isn't here yet, Miss.
Now, Barnstaple.
Very good, Miss.
Jackie!
Linnet!
- Jackie!
- Oh, Linnie!
I'm sorry.
- That fool of a butler didn't tell me.
- Oh, no, no. It's all right, it's all right.
- You look marvellous.
- Thank you. So do you, as always.
Where should I serve
the tea, Mademoiselle?
- Put it in the drawing room.
- Oui, Mademoiselle.
Let's go upstairs
and freshen up.
What's the matter with Louise?
Man trouble, what else?
She wants to get married,
to an Egyptian no less.
She knew absolutely nothing about
him, so I had him checked out.
- And?
- He had a wife already.
- So you put a stop to it.
- You bet I did.
I told her she couldn't look to me for a dowry,
and naturally he wouldn't touch her without one.
Men!
Oh, Linnet!
Oh!
- It's beautiful!
- I'm so glad you like it.
Listen, Linnet. I've got something
to tell you, and a favour to ask.
- Well, anything, you know that.
- No, no. This is serious.
- I'm engaged.
- Jackie!
Oh, it's wonderful!
- Will you give him a job?
- A job.
Here, at Wode Hall. Please.
Don't you think you should tell
me something about him, first?
Well, his name is Simon,
Simon Doyle, and he is...
oh, he's everything
I've ever dreamed of.
Jackie...
- Isn't it lovely?
- Yes, it's beautiful.
- Yes, it is, isn't it?
- The trouble is he's broke.
That makes two of us.
These shoes are killing me.
But he loves the country, and a
job here would be just ideal.
Oh, Linnet, I'll die
if I can't marry him.
I really will, I'll just die.
- You have got it badly.
- I know.
All right.
What do you want me to do?
Well, you've got this huge place.
You're going to need someone to run it for you.
- Simon!
- But I need someone with experience.
No, listen! He studied Estate Management
at Cambridge. He's very bright.
I'll tell you what, if you don't
like him, you can fire him.
But you will, I know you will.
All right. Why don't you
bring him down tomorrow?
- And I'll have a look at him.
- Thank you.
- Jackie!
- Bye-bye!
I just don't want
to feel a fool.
Don't worry. Linnet promised.
Well, almost.
I think Linnet may
not even like me.
Nonsense. She'll adore you!
And you're perfect for the job.
Perfect.
Well, I'll do my best
not to let you down.
Oh, Simon, I do love you.
You make me so happy!
- We'll honeymoon in Egypt.
- You always said we'd go to Egypt.
Hello!
Linnet!
Oh, Linnie. Here he is.
- Come on.
- Hold on, darling.
Here he is.
My Simon.
Hello.
Jackie's told me
so much about you.
Isn't he perfect?
Isn't he, Linny?
Yes, I think he'll
do very well.
I told you.
Linnet Ridgeway marries penniless Prince
Charming after whirlwind romance!
They plan to honeymoon in Egypt.
Jesus H. Christ!
Don't you mean Tut-Ankh-Amon?
Well, what the hell do we do?
The Bremen sails tonight.
I can just get on.
What, and try fixing
those British lawyers?
- No, you dolt.
- Then what?
I'll go to Egypt. Hell, she's
gonna be there for a month.
"Why, uncle Andrew!"
A chance meeting.
I'm over there on a trip.
Honeymoon lovers, she's not
thinking too clear, ...
Get the picture?
Look, Linnet's no
fool, Pennington.
Neither am I!
Well, you have a nice trip,
wicked uncle Andrew.
So that's the Ridgeway girl.
What are you
studying so closely?
Her picture...?
Or her pearls?
Keep a civil tongue in your head,
Bowers, or you'll be out of a job.
What do I care?
This town is filled with rich old widows
willing to pay for a little grovelling...
and a body massage.
You go ahead and fire me.
Temper, temper, Bowers!
It's obvious you need a holiday.
How would a little trip
down the Nile suit you?
There's nothing I
would dislike more.
There's two things in the world I
can't abide: It's heat and heathens.
Good, then we'll go.
Bowers, pack!
Why don't they put an
escalator in these things?
- Lazybones!
- Lazybones?
Don't you know it's better to
travel hopefully than to arrive?
What a view!
Happy, darling?
Silly! We must be the
happiest people alive.
And the prettiest.
- And the luckiest.
- And the alonest.
Just us and no one else.
The Neter-Menkewre pyramid is 204 feet high.
Each side of the base is
356 and one half feet.
- Jackie!
- What the hell are you doing here?
Seeing the sights,
like yourselves.
But you were at the Danielli
in Venice and at Brindisi too.
What a coincidence!
- Jackie, why?
- She's following us about, deliberately.
Is that true?
Well, it's intolerable!
And common.
Very, very common.
And effective.
Very, very effective.
Bye-bye.
- Bitch! Everywhere we go she pops up.
- Darling...
- Like some kangaroo in heat.
- Oh, I can't understand it.
- Can't you?
- Oh, I suppose it's my fault.
I broke our engagement
and went off with you.
She must be really unhappy.
- She's revelling in every minute of it.
- No.
Darling.
We are the lucky ones.
Don't let Jackie spoil it.
I won't.
This is the perfect honeymoon.
No one's gonna wreck it for us.
I love you.
I'll race you back.
- Colonel Race!
- Poirot!
Oh, I'm enchanted to see you!
- Oh, my old friend! How capital, how capital!
- Yes.
Oh, I haven't clapped
eyes on you since...
oh, that strange affair of
the decapitated clergyman.
I still think you were a trifle lucky to find
that cake knife up the chimney like that.
Lucky?
With me it's the exercise
of the little gray cells.
Luck, I leave to the others.
Yes, I've forgotten your
opinions about yourself.
Might one ask, what
are you doing here?
I'm on "les vacances".
Shortly I'm going up the
Nile on the steamer.
- And you?
- Oh, the same, oddly enough.
Oh. In other words, you're
following one of the passengers.
No, no. "Seulement les
vacances, mon ami."
- Like yourself.
- Yes.
This... chair is free, eh?
In this world, comrade,
nothing's free.
- Bitte?
- Forget it. Sit down.
- Thanks. You are reading "Das Kapital"?
- I never travel without it.
Dr. Ludwig Bessner.
Of the Bessner
Institute, Zurich.
Jim Ferguson, citizen
of the world.
- You... are on holidays perhaps, ah?
- No.
I'm observing the decline of the
capitalist system, my friend.
Oh, indeed.
Well, you've got a good
specimen there, eh?
The young Kagumi heiress.
That parasite!
- You don't approve?
- She makes me sick.
In any decent society...
Eh... ah, you may be right.
She has all together
too much power.
- Sir...
- Oh, "Thank you".
Chin-chin!
Linnet!
- Linnet, honey!
- Uncle Andrew!
What a surprise! I didn't know
you were travelling in Egypt!
Well, it's very sudden.
As a matter of fact,
I'm on my honeymoon.
Your honeymoon?
What do you know!
Is this the lucky young man?
Darling, this is my American lawyer
and trustee, Andrew Pennington.
Simon. Simon Doyle.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
- How do you do?
- Won't you join us?
- Well, just for a moment.
But don't worry.
I'm not going to intrude.
I know how young people are.
The centre of scene of all eyes.
Even you, with your
English reserve, gaze.
- She's very beautiful.
- Oh, she's very rich.
You know who she is, of course.
- Of course.
- Yes.
Do forgive me for butting in,
but I have a bet with
my daughter here,
that you are Hercules Porridge,
the famous French sleuth.
Not quite, I am Hercule Poirot,
the famous Belgian sleuth.
I told you, Rosalie.
There's only one Monsieur
Poirot in the world.
He's unmistakable.
As indeed I realize I am myself.
My mother is Salome
Otterbourne, the novelist.
Otter... Salo..., of course.
Enchant√©.
So here we are, two famous
people in one place.
Oh, three, surely.
I was talking about genius,
not mere money, Monsieur.
Oh, you know Colonel
Race, my old friend?
This is... and her daughter...
Charmed, simply charmed.
Please, you sit down,
Madame, Mademoiselle.
You're probably working on
some other book now, Madame.
Set in Egypt, perhaps?
How thrillingly clever of you to
deduce that, Monsieur Porridge!
I am here to absorb
local colour...
for my grand opus,"Snow
on the Sphinx's Face".
Frozen enigma turns
to incandescent love
as this young English girl from Hazel
Mills, scarcely out of school,
melts the barbarous heart
of a cruel desert sheik.
Somehow, I don't think
Monsieur Poirot
is a very keen reader of
romantic novels, Mother.
Of course he is,
all Frenchmen are.
They're not afraid
of good, strong sex!
Unlike, I might say, most of our
leading lending libraries.
They have banned Salome Otterbourne
for speaking the truth
about men and women.
But she goes on, nonetheless.
The truth, yes. The truth.
It's so difficult to tell.
Thank you, Monsieur.
Well, perhaps you would
join me in a tango, ...
Mademoiselle?
A little...
exercise after dinner.
Do you tango, Colonel?
- Poorly, I'm afraid, Miss Otterbourne.
- Then I shall teach you to do it right.
As it was done in old Spain, when
it was known as the "cheeker",
that is to say, with a
sensuous, erotic dash.
Damn it, Jackie!
Can't you leave us alone?
Waiter.
Monsieur Poirot!
Monsieur Poirot!
I saw you with
Linnet this morning.
How much is she paying
you to warn me off?
No, no. I accepted no commission
from Madame Doyle, nor will I.
What I have to say to you
is in pure friendship.
Ah, yes?
And what would you like to say?
That I'm making a public show of myself?
That I'm crazy?
I say bury the dead.
Not as the Egyptians do,
conserving the body
in order to ensure the
immortality of the soul. No.
Properly, finally.
Turn your back on the past.
Look only forward.
Remember, time heals everything.
If you think I'm suffering,
you're quite wrong.
Actually, I'm rather
enjoying myself.
Yes. Your pleasure is the very
worst part of it, Mademoiselle.
I don't care.
Simon was mine and he loved me.
Then she came along and...
It's only a tiny thing...
but it's lethal.
And my father taught
me to be a crack shot.
Sometimes, ...
I swear I'll put this gun
right against her head,
and then ever so gently
pull the trigger.
When I hear that sound
more and more...
I know how you feel.
We all feel like that at times.
Only I warn you, Mademoiselle...
Do not allow evil into your heart.
It will make a home there.
If love can't live there,
evil will do just as well.
Oh. How...
How sad, Mademoiselle.
Hello, Mr. P.
- You're going back to the hotel?
- Where else?
Look. It's a surprise for Linnet.
Do you think she'll like it?
That depends. Does she smoke?
Just Craven "A".
By the way...
Have you had a chance
to talk to Jackie yet?
Yes, just a few moments ago.
Well, good. I hope you got
her to see some sense.
Alas, to her, sense is
perpetual revenge.
Are you serious?
I'm always serious, mon ami.
Jackie's stubborn, I know,
and damn possessive.
- But surely...
- Did she want to possess you?
Well, I suppose so.
Yes, she did.
But she has a hell of a temper
and a mind of her own.
She wishes to wear the trousers.
Yes. And a man can't
have that, can he Mr. P.?
No, no, ne peut pas.
You know, when I first
met Linnet, ...
well, how should I put it?
It was like the moon after sunrise.
You just don't notice it's there any more.
After I met her, Jackie
just didn't exist.
Yes. Some women have that power.
But how are you going to find a
way out of your present dilemma?
Well, I have the most marvellous
plan and it's absolutely foolproof.
Cabby!
The Railway Station, quickly.
We're late for the Alexandria train.
To the Railway Station.
Fast as you can.
Haare ka!
Thank you.
Look. There she is.
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Welcome aboard the Karnak.
Yes.
My name is Mr. Choudry.
I'm the manager of this boat
and your delight and happiness
is my sole concern and pleasure.
Quite rightly.
I have here... I have here...
Yes, I have here a list of...
names and... and...
staterooms.
I guess from your faces
which is which, okay?
You are Mrs. and
Miss Otterbourne.
- Righty?
- Wrongy.
I'm Mrs. Van Schuyler
and I wish to be taken
to my cabin immediately.
Bowers will have the cabin
opposite, on the starboard side.
The roasting afternoon sun may do wonders
for those jaundiced jowls of hers.
Right away, Madam. Right away.
Yes. You must be Dr. Bessner.
Such elegant German moustaches.
I'm afraid you'd never make
a detective, Monsieur.
The moustaches, although
undeniably elegant, are Belgian.
My name is Poirot,
Hercule Poirot.
Ah, the famous Monsieur Poirot?
I grovel in mortification.
I grovel.
Look, wouldn't it just be simpler
for us to give you our names...
and you to give us the
cabins that we booked.
Simpler? Ah, lummy! Yes.
Unquestionably simpler.
Unquestionably.
Such a brilliant lack
of complication.
In a trice, the seafraring will
conduct you all to your stateroom.
Seafraring!
"Seafra...!
Ah, we start.
May I suggest that you all take
your last look at the city?
Seafra...!
Seafraring!
Well, we've done it.
We got rid of her, at last.
What did you expect?
You're a genius.
Well, it's not bad for
the Simple Simon.
Fabulous, isn't it?
You are the Ridgeway
girl, aren't you?
And you're Mrs. Van Schuyler.
I wondered if we'd
ever break the ice.
Well I seldom talk to strangers,
but never to strange honeymooners.
I'm glad you're
breaking your rule.
Well, rules are
made to be broken.
At least mine are... by me.
Oh, they're beautiful.
Thank you.
And amazing, ...
if you know how they're made.
A tiny piece of grit makes
its way into an oyster
which eventually becomes
a pearl of great price
hanging round the neck of
a pretty girl like you.
I never thought of it that way.
Well, you should.
The oyster nearly dies.
Come along now. Back to the cabin.
Time for your massage.
My Companion, Bowers.
She did 15 rounds once
with Jack Dempsey.
He was never the same man again.
Sorry, Miss Ridgeway.
Mrs. Doyle. Mrs. Simon Doyle.
You have got to
forgive Miss Bowers
she's just unfamiliar
with the marriage state.
- I saw you drooling over her pearls.
- Shut up, Bowers.
You'd give every tooth in your
head to lay your hands on them.
What nonsense, just because you've got a
grudge against her, or rather her father, ...
No need to be uncivil?
Grudge!?
Melhuish Ridgeway
ruined my family.
Well, you should be grateful.
If he hadn't, you'd have missed
the pleasure of working for me.
I could kill her on
that score alone.
Tea, Madam?
I am Salome Otterbourne
and I must have a word.
I thought we were already having words, ...
through our lawyers.
It is about that, that I
have come to supplicate.
- Supplicate?
- I mean to entreat or to appeal if you like.
I'm afraid we authors are a
little flowery in our speech.
And defamatory in our writing.
I'm sorry you should have taken "Passion
Under the Persimmon Tree" that way.
I assure you the intention was
merely to show a young girl's heart
beginning to beat to
the primordial drum.
Can't you see my dear that what I
wrote was really quite flattering?
Frankly, Miss Otterbourne,
I don't consider being likened to a
nympho-maniacal baboon, flattering,
and I suggest we leave it to our lawyers
to decide what is adequate compensation
for being the butt of
your vulgar drivel!
Good afternoon.
Philistine!
I'll show you what
reputation is about!
I'm sorry to intrude.
Uncle Andrew‚Ä¶.
But these are the papers I
told you needed signing.
The lease on the
Chrysler Building...
Ah let's see, the silver
mine concessions,
Baku oil transfers,
and the Corn Crisp
Choo-choo merger.
Just sign on the last page,
right on the bottom, my dear.
But Uncle Andrew, I
haven't even read it yet.
But there's no need, there's no need at all.
It's all quite straight forward checked,
and double checked, by me.
But I always read everything
through before I sign.
My father taught me that.
He always said never to trust anyone.
Not even your own lawyers.
Dear old Melhuish.
What a sense of humour!
Well, as far as I'm concerned, I never
read a legal document in my life
and I certainly don't
intend to start now.
You don't say.
- Isn't that a little feckless, Darling?
- Yes, absolutely.
But I'm dying for a
Manhattan, aren't you?
All right.
Seeing we're on our honeymoon.
That's a girl.
Now, the next one.
I do hope I'm not, uh, ...
butting in.
I am a lawyer. I just wanted to say how
much I admire your business like attitude.
Your father was
absolutely right.
Never sign a document
until you've read it.
I'm sure you agree, sir.
Uh‚Ä¶sure. Sure. There's no hurry.
Well, now if you excuse me.
I hope I've not given offense.
What if you have? Mister‚Ä¶?
- Race. Colonel Race.
- What if you have, Colonel?
Lawyers are trained to
deal with offenses.
- Would you join us for a drink in the bar?
- Thank you. Most kind.
And what about you, Mr. P.?
After all, there's cause
for celebration.
As you see my plan to lose
Jackie worked like a charm.
Yes, so it would ah, ...
so it would seem.
Mes f√©licitations.
Colonel Race and I
will join you in a...
moment.
Darling.
- Madame, I must talk with you.
- Later, Louise.
No, now! It's important.
I'll see you in the bar.
- Well?
- I've received a cable.
My fianc√© has sent his
woman back to her people.
He's waiting for me.
I must go to him.
Please, give me the money
that you promised me.
I've been with you
for 5 years now.
It's completely out
of the question.
Madame, you promised me.
He's still married, Louise.
I implore you.
I need that money as a dowry.
I've worked hard for you.
And you'll continue to do
so until I say otherwise.
- Madame, you can't refuse me.
- Thank you, Louise.
Chameau!
Mon Dieu, how she makes
enemies of them all.
Even her own lawyer is trying to...
cheat her?
You old fox! So you noticed?
Well, I knew that you weren't
here, how was it again?, ...
"seulement pour les
vacances, mon ami".
Yes, I suppose I can tell you.
Sub Rosa, I am working for
Mrs. Doyle's English lawyers,
and they suspect Andrew Pennington of...
well of...
- Embezzling her money!
- That's about the size of it.
You see under the terms
of the father's will,
she gets control of the
money when she marries, ...
and as she has
recently married...
he is trying to get her to sign a document
which will get him out of... the soup.
Exactly.
I think I've scared him off for the moment,
but who knows what he'll try next.
Or any of them, for that matter.
Inside the Great
Temple of Karnak,
we pass the pedestals of
numerous small rams... Ja.
Each with a small image of Amenophis
III in front of it. Yeah.
Oh, yes, rams.
Lecherousch, priapic,
erotisch, ... Rams!
How noble they are!
With their proud flanks,
flared nostrils, ...
and unashamed curled horns.
Ja, ...
Ja, come, fraulein, come.
You know, Carl Marx said
that religion was the
opium of the people.
For your mother,
it's obviously sex.
Don't you think you better
calm her down a little?
She'd do one of those
beasts a fearful injury.
Look, Mr. Ferguson.
My mother may be a figure of fun for you,
but she still happens
to be my mother.
She kept me marvellously in better days, and
I'm not going to desert her now that...
- Now that what?
- Nothing.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be nosy.
And I certainly didn't mean to offend you.
Honestly, Miss Otterbourne,
I am not as bad as I look.
- Aren't you?
- Scout's honour?
Would you mind offending her?
Linnet Ridgeway's a leech.
A parasite on the
skin of society.
For God's sake, in a sane world, she'd be
bumped off as a warning to the others.
- Bumped off?
- That's what I said.
- Mr. Ferguson?
- Jim.
Jim, ... is it true you
can't libel the dead?
I'm not sure I
understand the question.
Never mind.
Oh look, isn't it wonderful?
Sight beyond comprehension!
Ah, the artistic temperament,
Monsieur Pennington.
What strange forms it takes!
I'm afraid that doesn't much
concern me, Monsieur Poirot.
I confine myself to the
world of facts and figures.
The ancient Egyptians felt quite
at home with facts and figures.
The Grand Vizier Ptahotep,
was crushed to death under a
thousand pieces of silver
because he embezzled
his master's treasury.
- You don't say.
- Oh, yes.
Oh, God!
You all right?
Linnet, you all right?
Come on. Easy.
That's it, come on, up you come.
All right?
What happened?
That stone must have
fallen or was pushed.
To kill me?
Jackie!
But she's not here!
- Oh, my poor Madame, that was a close shave.
- It could've been a nasty accident.
Accident? That stone has been
up there for 4000 years,
it chooses the moment to fall when
there are people underneath it? No.
Not exactly 4000 years, Hercule.
The pillars were
built in 1788 BC ...
We all agree with you, Herr Bessner.
You may have a patient on your hands. Please.
Oh, most negligent of me!
- Ja, ja, here.
- I'm all right. Really I am.
Ja, ja, but I think maybe you go back
to the boat, you take a little rest, eh?
All right.
But only a couple
of hours, Doctor.
I must see the Temple of
Abu Simbel this evening.
Oh, that is most extraordinary.
Did you know that the Eastern-most
figure is the famous Vocal Statue?
- Really?
- Ja.
Then we must be there in time.
Thank you, doctor.
At sunset it emits a
sad plaintive note.
- He scares me.
- Oh, he's harmless.
My god, it's fantastic.
I think they're frightening.
No, they're not.
Do you think he'll
sing a note for me?
Why not? You're divine.
Welcome to the Temple
of Abu Simbel.
The facade is 84 feet long.
Each of the statues of Ramses
the Second is 65 feet high.
Get away from me!
Get away!
Get away from me!
Okay, darling!
Don't let her spoil everything.
So you could not
bury your dead.
- You cannot stay away.
- Nope, I can't keep away.
You didn't really think I'd be fooled
by any trick Simon could invent?
I'm very sorry to see
you here, Mademoiselle.
Forgive me for saying so, but you're embarking
on a hazardous journey in troubled waters.
You face who knows what
currents of misfortune.
- Why do you say that?
- Because it's the truth.
You're cutting the last bonds
which bind you to safety.
You can still turn back
if you really want to.
One must follow one's
star wherever it leads.
Even to disaster?
Even to hell itself.
I left my bag in the bar.
I'll join you in a minute, darling.
Well ...
We are alone, mein frau.
The opportunity to talk to you in
private has not presented itself before.
- What do we have to talk about?
- My reputation, Frau Doyle.
- You ran that institute in Zurich.
- That is so.
And you have been saying so many
unpleasant things about me
to people of influence
and position.
- I say you're a quack.
- Frau Doyle!
- What's more, you're a dangerous quack.
- No, listen to me!
My dead friend Myra Seligman
listened to you. Too well!
And allowed you to give her
those filthy injections.
I prescribed a course
of armadillo urine.
Ja, I had used it previously
with great success.
In the case of poor Myra she
went barking mad, thanks to you.
I will not allow this.
These irresponsible remarks about
my treatment have got to stop!
Then sue me, if you dare.
No, you know that is impossible.
Any scandal attached to my
clinic would bring instant ruin.
Then it's rather your
funeral, isn't it?
Well, let's hope that
it is not yours!
Do you want a cr√®me de cacao
or a cognac, perhaps?
The service upstairs is so slow.
Nein. Danke.
What time is it?
There's a clock. Use your eyes.
Didn't your mother ever tell you,
as far as servants are concerned,
there is a vast difference between amiable
eccentricity and downright rudeness?
- My mother was a lady.
- A disposition she failed to pass on to you.
It's your bed time.
Very well. Where's my stole?
I haven't seen it.
- You sure you had it with you?
- Of course I'm sure.
Well, I haven't
seen it anywhere.
Use your eyes.
Monsieur Poirot?
I hope one day
you'll be able to tell me
about some of your cases.
The... the juicier ones.
- Ju... juicier ones?
- Bloodier.
Quand vous voulez, Madame.
Enchant√©.
- Good night. Good night, monsieur.
- Bon soir.
- Oh! So sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.
You look very sleepy tonight,
Monsieur Porridge.
Yes, I'm... extremely.
I'm consumed by sleep, madame.
I don't know why, but I can hardly...
keep my eyes open.
Naughty. Me, too.
Perhaps you'd be good enough
to escort me to my cabin?
It is this way, as you know.
I suppose that uncouth young man will
appear now and attempt to seduce you.
Well, don't let him succeed without
at least the show of a struggle.
Remember, the chase
is very important.
Oh, mother!
No, this way is better.
There's a beastly step here,
which I always trip on.
No, no, that's the river!
No, no. No, no, no, ...
The old Nile is a bit
choppy tonight, you see.
Yes, it is true.
There are disturbing currents.
Here we are. Here we are.
No, no, no, no.
In there.
- Bon soir.
- Bon soir! Bon soir, madame.
Hello.
- Been ashore?
- Yes. It's lovely in the moonlight.
A real honeymoon night.
If the clergyman's daughter
drinks nothing but water,
she's certain to finish on gin.
One diamond.
- Simon, ... we're waiting.
- Sorry.
It's your call.
- Double.
- What?
He was her man,
but he was doing her wrong...
Join me?
No, thank you.
Would you mind
repeating your bid?
Sorry.
If the aunt of the vicar
has never touched liquor,
just wait 'till she finds the champagne.
Bottoms up!
I'm sorry darling,
I wasn't thinking.
Swore to be true
to each other...
- true as the stars above.
- I'm afraid that gives you the rubber.
- He was her man.
- I think I'll go to bed.
I think it's time to turn in.
I'll second that.
- Good night, ... sleep tight.
- Good night.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.
- Coming, Simon?
- I won't be a second, darling. I'll just tidy up.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- It is late, I think I'll be going, too.
- Oh no, no, no. You, s-s-stay!
Tell me all about yourself.
There's not very much
to tell, really.
I'm Salome Otterbourne's
daughter, as you know.
If the wife of a divine
has never touched wine,
you can bet she'll end
up with the scotch.
Go on, you were something...
saying something, about
somebody's daughter.
Salome Otterbourne,
the novelist.
Salome?
Didn't she have some
fellow's head cut off?
It should happen to
somebody else I know.
- Don't you think you've had enough?
- Enough what?
- To drink.
- To drink.
What business is it of yours?
- None, I suppose.
- Damn right.
What's the matter,
Simon, afraid?
- Afraid of what?
- Afraid...
I might tell this charming
young lady the story of my life.
- I really must be going.
- No, no, wait!
It's a very sad tale.
A three-hanky story if
you're easily moved.
For god's sake, Jackie.
What?
Go to bed, and stop making
a fool of yourself.
Oh, Simon says I'm
making a fool of myself.
Simon says go to bed.
Bed...!
You make me sick!
Go to bed!
You can't treat me like this!
Now look, Jackie!
I'll kill you first!
Jackie!
Quick. Help him!
Oh, my god!
I'll get Dr. Bessner.
Get her to her cabin.
Calm her down.
What have I done...?!
Oh, that Bowers woman.
She's a nurse, isn't she?
Get her to look after her.
Come on.
Simon ...
Make sure she's not left alone.
Then get the doctor!
Quickly!
Lie down.
I'll get Miss Bowers.
- Simon!
- Take it easy.
Rosalie's gone to get Miss Bowers.
She's a nurse, she'll look after you.
You've been the devil of a time.
Miss Bowers, she'd gone to bed.
She'll be here in a minute.
- The sooner the better.
- How is she?
As well as can be expected for a girl
who's just tried to shoot her ex-lover.
How can you be so heartless?
There now.
Miss Bowers is just coming.
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.
It's Doyle.
There's been an accident.
Yes, yes.
Miss Otterbourne told me.
I think a shot of morphia
will meet the case.
I've always found it very effective
when Mrs. Van Schuyler is carrying on.
Ferguson, you'd better go and get
that... that "hun" doctor from next door.
- He'll go and look at Doyle.
- Yes, right.
Bad this.
Give me one more cloth, ja?
All right.
The bone is fractured.
There is much losses of blood, ja.
All right.
All right, all right.
Help me get him to my cabin, ja?
Are you afraid of
a little blood?
Like a young m√§dchen?
Come here, Ferguson.
Help me get him up.
I'll stay with her tonight.
You never know how
they're going to react.
- Miss Bowers, is she quiet?
- Yes.
Yes, I've given
her some morphia.
I won't leave her.
Ah, good.
Young lady, you
come with me, ja?
You'll be more use than this stutzer here,
who's afraid at the sight of a little blood.
Open the door. Ja.
- Easy, All right, all right.
- Ah-Ah...!
That's it.
Almost... Here we are.
Ja.
All right.
Could you get a cool
towel for the head, ja?
Yes, doctor.
I better go and
pick up that gun.
It's not the sort of thing we want
to leave lying around, is it?
- Ja.
- Yes.
Jackie.
Sh... She mustn't be left alone.
She isn't. Don't worry.
Oh, God.
It's all been my fault.
I treated her so badly.
She didn't know what she was doing.
She was drunk.
Now, this is going to hurt.
Are you sure someone shouldn't tell...
tell your wife?
Yes.
Yes, please.
No. No, no, let her sleep.
Nothing to worry her til morning.
The best I can do
is patch it up.
There is no exit wound.
The bullet is lodged deep in there.
Ja, it will have to wait
until we get to Wadi Halfa.
Roll up the sleeve.
Get.
And swab it with this, eh?
Ja.
I will have some splints made.
And then I will set them, ...
when you are asleep, eh?
Thank you, Doctor.
Ja.
Now, don't you worry.
Everything's going
to be all right.
It's not there.
Was?
The gun. It's not there.
But who could have taken it?
Search me.
I only hope it's not important.
"Sometimes I want to put this
little gun up to her head,
and very gently
pull the trigger."
Was?
Oh, nothing.
I've just seen the manager and
he put the matter in my hands
so it will be our responsibility
until we reach Wadi Halfa.
- Well, I am at your disposal, of course.
- Thank you.
- So doctor, what can you tell us about this?
- She was shot with a very small bullet.
A 22 calibre, I think.
And the gun was held
very close to the head.
Here you can see
all the versengen.
Damn it man, can't
you speak English?
- Oh, you mean the... scorching.
- Ja, ja, the scorching.
Excuse me...
Tiens, tiens, tiens...
- What do you make of that?
- Huh?
Oh, I think it's...
I think it's easy.
You see, Madame Doyle was dying.
She wished to identify
the murderer... to us,
and therefore she dipped her
finger in her own blood.
She wrote "J" on the wall.
"Jacqueline"!
Oh, what you say is dumb.
The lady dies instantly!
- Really?
- Ja.
There's no time for writing
with the finger in blood.
No, no.
Oh, you make a joke?
Well, it's a very small one, not
in very good taste, I'm afraid.
The fact remains the "J" is on the wall.
Now it's up to us to explain why.
It seems a gesture, which
is childishly melodramatic.
Doctor, what about
the time of death?
Well, ...
She has been dead
at least 6 hours,
no longer than eight.
That puts it between
midnight and 2 AM.
- Which is extraordinary.
- Why is that?
Because it means quite simply
that Mademoiselle Jacqueline...
could not have done it.
You told me yourself,
Mon Colonel,
that Madame Doyle left the observation
saloon a little before 11:45,
to go to bed.
And from then on,
Jackie was in view either of
Mademoiselle Rosalie and Monsieur Doyle
or Monsieur Ferguson and
Mademoiselle Bowers,
who injected her with morphia
and stayed with her in
her cabin all night.
And Simon Doyle is also eliminated
by reason of his broken leg.
I don't suppose he could walk
very far with that wound?
Not one step, I assure you.
Excellent! Let's hope the process
of elimination continues as smoothly.
I am afraid it will
not, Mon Colonel.
After all, everyone
on this boat
knew exactly why Mademoiselle
Jacqueline hated Madame Doyle.
She was a natural for what the
Americans would call a "frame up".
At least, Mein Herr,
you cannot suspect me!
Oh, why not?
You had a very good reason to kill
her, as I discovered last night.
Oh. Then you did overhear!
But that was no motive.
I mean I could have sued her.
And risk ruin?
Murder is cheaper.
And safer, if you
don't get caught.
- But I... I could not have done such a thing.
- I disagree.
At the time of the shooting
of Monsieur Doyle,
you could have been on deck,
perhaps unable to sleep.
You could have heard
the sound of voices,
looked through the
window of the saloon,
seen what happened, ...
Go to bed!
You can't treat me like this!
Now look, Jackie!
I'll kill you first!
Jackie!
and remembed the
position of the gun.
Later, when you were
called from your cabin,
you could have picked up the gun
while you were tending
Monsieur Doyle.
Later still, when all was quiet,
you could have left your cabin,
unobserved by your sleeping patient,
and gone to Madame
Doyle's cabin,
and shot her.
No, Herr Doctor, I
cannot rule you out.
What you are suggesting
is √ºberm√§ssig!
Outrageous!, Ja!.
I will not stay here to...
to be insulted.
Found something in
the nail varnish?
On attrape pas les mouches
avec le vinaigre.
- I beg your pardon?
- It's an old French proverb,
which...it takes too
long to explain.
Come my friend. Let us prepare
ourselves for our investigation
of the paying customers.
How long was it, in
your estimation,
between the time you
and Doctor Bessner
carried Monsieur Doyle
from the saloon
to when you returned
to look for the gun?
- Oh, about three or four minutes.
- Three or four minutes.
By your own admission, you were just outside
the saloon when the shooting took place.
In other words, it would have
been perfectly possible for you
to have noted the
position of the gun.
I agree. Perfectly possible.
Perfectly possible.
Also, for you...
to have waited until
the saloon was empty,
then to have taken the gun,
and only pretended not
to have found it.
Then, before returning to Doctor
Bessner to report its loss,
you could have used it
to kill Madame Doyle.
I could have done, but as
it happens, I didn't!
And you, Mademoiselle?
You could have taken the
gun before you left here,
when Monsieur Ferguson
was helping Monsieur Doyle.
- I'll get Miss Bowers.
- Yeah, right.
On your way to fetch Miss Bowers,
you could have seized the opportunity
to take the gun to Madame Doyle's cabin
and murder her.
It would have added only a minute or
two to the time that you were away.
Wake up!
Miss Bowers!
What's that?
Could you please come quickly?
There's been an accident.
Why should either of us
take the blasted gun?
We have no reason to
murder Linnet Doyle.
Ah, but she was "a leech".
She was "a parasite on
the skin of society"...
"...who deserved
to be bumped off".
- Well, yes, but ...
- Oh, yes, Monsieur. "Bumped off", ...
"as a warning to the others".
You damned froggy eavesdropper.
Belgian. Belgian eavesdropper,
if you please, sir.
And you, Mademoiselle.
You were eager to save
your mother great damages.
How could I possibly
have done that?
You asked a question two days ago.
I will now answer it for you.
You are quite right,
Mademoiselle, ...
"You cannot libel the dead".
I think you're horrid.
You pretend to be so kind and considerate,
and all you want to do is trap us.
I must find out what lies
hidden, Mademoiselle.
The truth.
What it amounts to, then, is after you
gave Miss Jacqueline the morphia,
- ...she never stirred all night.
- Exactly.
Nervous reaction, booze,
and morphia, together.
They'd have sunk the Titanic.
So, unquestionably, she could
not have done the murder?
No, absolutely not.
No, ... but you could have.
Me?
Yes, you, Mademoiselle.
Let us suppose you were out on
deck at the time of the shooting,
and saw what took place,
and thus knew where
the gun was lying.
Young lady, you
come with me, ja?
You'll be more help
than this stutzer here
who's scared at the
sight of a little blood.
While Monsieur Ferguson and
Mademoiselle Rosalie...
were assisting
Doctor Bessner, ...
you could have left your unconscious patient
and run in here to pick up the gun.
You would have had enough time before
Monsieur Ferguson returned to search for it.
Then you could have hurried down the
port side to Madame Doyle's cabin...
and shot her.
Preposterous.
Why should I kill Mrs. Doyle?
Because her father was
Melhuish Ridgeway,
whose unscrupulous business
methods ruined your father...
and condemned you to
a servant's life.
Poppycock.
From whom did you hear that?
From your own lips, Mademoiselle,
three days ago.
How dare you listen to a
private conversation!
Some voices carry.
Is it true?
Yes, it is.
Voil√†!
But why should I kill Mrs. Doyle for
something that happened years ago?
Because its effects are still
deeply resented by you to this day.
No, unfortunately, Mademoiselle,
I cannot be persuaded
by your protestations.
To my mind, you had the means, the motive,
the opportunity, and what is more,
the disposition to kill.
- Have you quite finished, Monsieur Poirot?
- For the time being, ...
but you will hold yourself ready to answer
further questions should the need arise.
I shall do no such thing.
Monsieur Poirot ...
It is true... about Linnet?
It is perfectly true.
I didn't kill her.
I know you all think
I did, but I didn't.
Calmez vous, calmez
vous, ma petit.
We know that you did not kill Madame Doyle.
We have proved it.
- Proved!
- Thank God.
W-w-what about Simon?
Is he all right?
Doctor Bessner seems reasonably
satisfied with his condition so far.
I was mad last night.
I might have killed him.
Do you think he'll
ever forgive me?
It's more than likely.
It's been my experience that
men are least attracted
to women who treat them well.
Miss Bowers, will you please escort Miss Jacqueline
to her cabin and see that she's all right?
We'll arrange a visit to
Monsieur Doyle later.
Oh, thank you.
I think you and I should visit him first.
He must be awake by now.
Very good.
The thing which intrig...
intrigues me most about
this case, is the pistol.
- The pistol?
- Why is it missing?
Well, I fail to see why that is so important.
In many cases the murder weapon is missing.
Even in a case where a
"frame-up" is attempted? No.
Why did the murderer go to the lengths
of writing "J" on the wall in blood,
and then removing "J" 's gun?
Yes, I see what you mean.
Oh, they found something.
One thing is for certain: Madame
Doyle was not killed by a fish.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.
I must have just blacked
out for a moment.
Try a spot of lunch.
It might give you some strength.
- No, thank you. I couldn't face it.
- You couldn't face it?
- Do you permit, that, uh...
- Please, do. Help yourself.
I just can't believe it...
that Linnet's dead.
It's a bad knock.
I suppose it must look awfully
black against Jackie, ...
but I just know she wouldn't
commit cold-blooded murder.
No, rest assured, Monsieur,
we know for a fact it was
not Mademoiselle Jackie.
Thank God for that.
Well, then, do you have any
idea who it might have been?
Well, it could be
practically anybody.
Well, only yesterday
she was saying...
everyone around her on
this boat was her enemy.
We have reason to believe
that she was right, Monsieur.
Monsieur...
Oh, pardon.
I came to see if you
were comfortable.
As comfortable as can be expected.
Thank you, Louise.
Ah, the discoverer of the body.
You should be able to shed
some light on all this.
Pardon?...
You, you, you accuse me?
A respectable girl?
- I swear to you on my mother's grave I...
- Allons, allons, ... Louise.
Pas tant d'histoires...
Il faut dire la v√©rit√©.
Asseyez-vous.
Monsieur le detective, il
faut pas douter de moi.
Cette pauvre Madame Doyle.
Tout le monde I'aimait. Elle √©tait s...
Elle √©tait si jeune, si belle.
Il y a personne qui aurait voulu la tuer.
Louise, pas de blague.
Nous nous connaissons...
Poirot, can we please keep this in some
language which we can all understand?
She said that all the world
loved Madame Doyle.
At least that's a
fresh approach.
Now then, when did you
last see Mrs. Doyle alive?
Last night, Monsieur.
I was in her cabin to undress
her and put her to bed.
And then where did you go?
To my cabin. Where else?
And you didn't see or hear anything
after that that might help us?
How could I, Monsieur?
My cabin was on the other side of the boat.
Naturally, if I'd
been unable to sleep,
if I'd stayed on deck then,
perhaps I would have
seen this assassin
enter and leave Madame's cabin.
But as it is ...
Oh, Monsieur, I implore you!
You see how it is.
- What else can I say?
- Nobody's accusing you of anything.
Now, don't worry, Louise.
I'll look after you.
- Monsieur is very good.
- But...
If you had not gone straight back to
your cabin after leaving Madame Doyle,
you would have had time...
to witness the shooting of
Monsieur Doyle in the saloon.
- Ah non!
- Ah oui!
You could have walked on
the deck, seen everything.
Then when the coast was clear,
you could have taken the gun,
returned, ...
and shot Madame Doyle.
Monsieur, you
accuse me unjustly.
Why should I do such a wicked thing?
Just answer me that.
Oh, Louise...
I know all about you,
and your love affair,
and Madame Doyle's objections
to your leaving her.
But I had no money,
and no references.
I had no choice but to stay.
Pr√©cis√©ment.
And how you hated her for that!
But I didn't kill her.
One final question, Louise.
Where are Madame Doyle's pearls?
Her, her pearls?
She, she was wearing
them last night.
She put them on the
table by her bed.
And were they there
this morning?
Mon Dieu! I didn't even look!
I went to her bed, I saw Madame,
I cried out, and I
ran out of the room.
You did not even look!
But I, Hercule Poirot, have
eyes which notice everything.
The pearls were not on the
dressing table this morning.
They had gone, ...
vanished, ...
disparu.
- We must find the gun.
- And the pearls.
Yes, that should not
prove too difficult.
Oh l√† l√†! Qu'il fait chaud!
You're right.
Yes, I could do with a change of shirt.
Yes, let's make a little
pause to freshen la toilet.
And to rest the
little grey cells.
I'll see you in five minutes.
I must thank you for a
most timely deliverance.
It was my pleasure.
I heard your SOS.
- Do you think it was put there deliberately?
- Of course it was.
But it will take more than a serpent
to interrupt the investigation...
of Hercule Poirot.
How is the sleuthing going?
With eminence and discretion?
- No one to put the hand-grips on?
- Not yet.
There is a dead... cobra, over there.
Do me the kindness of having it removed, please.
Thank you very much.
Come, Race.
A cobra? Oh cripes!
Never have I seen such a reptile
in a first class cabin.
Never.
Who's next? Pennington?
You know he's a wrongen.
Oh, he's a dangerous one.
Monsieur Poirot, I presume?
Excusez moi, Madame.
Perhaps you will
permit us to join you?
Of course.
- Well?
- Your cabin is next to Madame Doyle's, n'est pas?
- It is.
- Did you hear anything strange late last night?
I certainly did.
I am a very light sleeper,
and I was awakened
by a popping sound.
A popping sound?
Exactly. Just like a champagne
cork coming out of a bottle.
An indifferent champagne,
you understand?
Not a great vintage.
That makes a much
more discreet sound.
Could it have been a small pistol
instead of an old champagne cork?
Very possibly.
Though I'm sure you
must appreciate
that I have a minimal
familiarity with firearms.
We have found it!
We have found it!
Oh, goody-goody!
Oh, goody-goody gumdrops!
This certainly takes
the camel's hump.
Oh, yes!
And no mistake!
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, I'm sure we have
found what you're looking for.
- Thank you, Mr. Choudry.
- No mention.
Ah, without question, the
pistol of Mademoiselle Jackie.
New Derringer 22,
- 4 shot.
- 2 bullets fired.
A man's handkerchief.
Looks like blood.
And a marble ashtray to
send it to the bottom.
And my stole.
This is yours, madam?
Well, of course it's mine.
I missed it last night in the saloon.
Look, the murderer must've wrapped it around
the pistol, to deaden the noise of the shots.
Impertinence! That stole was
given to me in Romania by...
Crown Prince Carol himself.
People are no respecters of
other people's property.
Nor, indeed of other
people's jewellery.
What can you be
referring to, Monsieur?
I'm referring to the
Potsdam pearls, Madame!
Which belong to Madame Doyle
and which have been abducted!
Abducted?
D√©rob√©.
Purloined.
Pinched.
And why are you looking at me
in that, "too familiar",
continental way?
What have these
pearls to do with me?
Ah, I am the nasty little
eavesdropper, Madame.
I heard that you much admire these
pearls, that you would give...
"every tooth in your
head to possess them.".
That bloody Bowers!
It is my theory that you have an
obsessive love of jewellery, Madame.
That you coveted
Madame Doyle's pearls.
And that you determined
to possess them,
even if this meant robbery...
or, murder?
You do not deny it, Madame?
I can picture you walking
the deck last night,
waiting for Madame
Doyle to be asleep.
Go to bed!
Quite by chance, you see the
shooting in the saloon.
Look, Jackie!
I'll kill you first!
Jackie!
When the room is empty, you seize
the opportunity of taking the gun,
you go to Madame Doyle's cabin knowing
that her husband will not be there.
You shoot her, ...
and then you take the pearls
from her bedside table.
You will withdraw that!
...Or I shall prosecute you for
slander with the utmost vigour!
It will not equal the vigour with
which I shall search this boat,
and in particular, your cabin
Madame, for those pearls.
I give you a good afternoon.
You perfectly foul,
French upstart!
Belgian upstart, please, Madame.
Was it necessary to be so
rough on the old lady?
I mean really, you seem to be
accusing everybody.
With reason, mon Colonel.
What, you think old ladies don't commit murder?
I am convinced she
has the pearls.
The only question is, did
she kill to acquire them?
Monsieur Choudry!
Marhaba!
- Yes, Colonel?
- We will depart immediately.
I've already given the orders.
At this very moment, the
engineer is building up steam.
Why the sudden rush?
I tell you, mon Dieu, I feel the
presence of evil all about me.
The sooner we reach
Wadi Halfa, the better.
- I'll lock these up in a safe place.
- Then we must commence our search for the pearls.
That's the last of the crew's cabins.
Maybe she threw them overboard.
You forget that we have not yet
examined Pennington's cabin.
That's right.
Let's do it now.
Ahoy there!
So our journey is continuing.
Good afternoon, Madame.
Will you not join me for
a little refreshment?
This marvellous little man here
has just made me the most
extraordinary concoction
out of native fruit juices.
It's called a "Golden Sepik",
and is named after the god of the
ancient city of "Crocadilpiece".
Not for me, thank
you very much.
Sometimes I do take the hair of the dog,
but never the scale of the crocodile.
Race...!
And how are you getting along
with your investigation
of this tragic affair,
Monsieur Porridge?
Ah, normalment, Madame.
Normally, as they say.
Oh, the crime passionnelle,
the primitive instinct to kill,
so closely allied
to the sex instinct.
I have every sympathy for that
poor, half-crazed Jackie.
Her emotions are a termoil,
her hot Latin blood raging
to be avenged on the
woman who stole her man.
Yes, of course, but it could
have been someone else,
with a motive at least as good.
Oh, who?
You, Madame Otterbourne.
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come, come. Both your daughter...
and you know that "you cannot
libel the dead".
Now you will never have to pay those
huge damages she was asking for.
- Yes, but one would hardly kill for that.
- Would one not?
- Well?
- I'll have another Golden What-Have-You.
You know, Mrs. Otterbourne...
it is you that I can see looking
into the saloon through the windows
at that, as you put it,
poor, half-crazed Jacqueline,
shooting Monsieur Doyle.
And then, when
everyone has gone,
running in to take up the gun,
and then stealing forth
to kill Madame Doyle.
No! My world is the world of grand love and
passionate romance, not grubby murders.
Now if you please,
leave me alone.
Well, if we have disturbed
you, we are both desolate.
Life can be so cruel!
You must be brave, very brave,
to bear the calumnies of life.
Here, Barman!
This crocodile has lost its "croc..."!
What a perfectly dreadful woman.
Why doesn't somebody shoot her, I wonder?
Perhaps one day, the subscribers
of the lending libraries
will club together and
hire an assassin.
So Madame Van Schuyler is foolish enough
to play games with Hercule Poirot.
You realize, of course, you have no
actual proof that she stole them.
The fact that the pearls have been
returned does not mean for a moment
that she did not kill while
stealing them in the first place.
Pennington?
We must find that...
that document he was trying to
induce Madame Doyle to sign.
What's this?
- Poirot.
- Yeah?
Ho! Well, that proves that Mademoiselle Jackie was
not the only passenger who was travelling armed.
Still, Linnet Doyle was not
shot with a thing this size.
No, obviously not.
Oh l√† l√†, l√† l√† l√† l√†!
Quelle pagaille!
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Your eyes are better. Tell me.
What the hell is going on?
We're going through your private
papers, sir, isn't that obvious?
You're what?
It may be the custom in Paris to go through other
people's things, but we're not in Paris now!
Brussels, sir!
The country is...
I don't care if it's Borneo!
You have no right to be in
my cabin, no right at all!
We have every right.
Pending the arrival of the Police,
the Company has commissioned
us to investigate this murder.
Which has nothing to
do with my papers!
On the contrary. They prove that, in
spite of Madame Doyle's marriage,
you are still trying
to control her money.
So what?
There's no law against it.
There is a law against
swindling your client,
and my people don't like
to see it contravened.
Your people?
Who the hell are they?
I represent Mrs. Doyle's
English lawyers,
and quite frankly, we are not at
all happy about the way you...
and your partner, have been
handling her affairs.
- Go to hell.
- Now look here...
- Her affairs are in perfect order.
- Oh, I wish that were true.
You see, I think you came over here in order to
get her signature on this power of attorney.
You failed, ...
and so you went to
the Temple of Amun,
and you climbed to the
top of the tall pillar.
There, you dislodged
a stone which fell,
and which narrowly
avoided killing her.
You can't pin that on me.
Now, get out of here!
I've heard enough of this garbage.
You may have to, one day, listen to a little more of
such garbage from the lips of a public prosecutor.
Oh, this is yours, I believe.
Belgium.
Let us change for dinner.
J'ai faim.
- Poirot, you have a woman?
- Femme is woman.
J'ai faim. I am peckish.
Oh, ... I must have a word
with that little one.
I will join you at the
table, Mon Colonel.
Be good enough to order
me les morilles.
Les morilles? Oh, moray.
Well, how goes it
with you, ma petite?
Badly, Monsieur Poirot.
I feel so ashamed.
His wife's dead, and...
Now he's available to you again.
Is it so wrong of me to
hope he'll come back?
I still love him.
And now he needs
me more than ever.
Oh, Monsieur Poirot, could I...?
Could you arrange
for me to see him?
Just for five minutes. Please!
I don't see why not.
That is, if he wishes, and the
Herr Doctor raises no objection.
I will make some inquiries.
Ah, good!
The temperature is down!
All right, Herr Poirot.
I've no objection, provided
the visit is short.
- F√ºnf Minuten at the most, ja?
- Merci, Docteur.
Mademoiselle Jackie!
You can see him now.
Thank you!
- Hello, Jackie.
- Simon.
I'm very sorry about Linnet.
- Thank you.
- Simon, I didn't kill her. I swear that.
You don't have to say it.
I know.
Forgive me. Please.
Jackie.
Last night I... I was mad.
I might have killed you.
What, with a...
rotten little pea-shooter like that?!
Will it be...?
Will you walk again?
Don't be a chump.
As soon as we get to Wadi Halfa they'll take the
damn thing out and I'll be as right as rain.
- Hu-Hum...!
- Ah, ja! Yeah!
Remember, f√ºnf minuten, ja?
Oh, Simon, I'm so dreadfully sorry!
There now.
There's nothing to apologize for.
Qu'est-ce que c'est √ßa?
I asked for a plate of morilles.
- Oh what's that?
- Mushrooms.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you wanted a moray eel.
That's the best they could do.
- Anyway, I've ordered you a new bottle of wine.
- Why?
Because the remains of last night's bottle
was a little mouldy when he poured it out.
- Mouldy?
- Yes, you know, it had a lot of bits in it.
But that's the normal sediment for
a great bottle of Ch√¢teau Petrus.
- Will you join me in some?
- No, thanks.
You stick to your wine,
I'll stick to my whisky.
You drink whisky all the...
Wine...
Oh, how strange!
Of course.
May I...?
You know, Poirot, the way I see
it, everybody could have done it.
And everyone had a
reason for doing it.
It's incredible.
Absolutement.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Good evening, Madam. Please ...
Come quick.
Quick.
- Fetch Dr. Bessner.
- Yes, sir.
You see what this is?
Money.
Looks like a piece of a
thousand-franc note.
It has to be blackmail.
She must have known something
about Linnet Doyle's murderer.
What idiots we have been!
Ah, non de rien!!
What did she say this afternoon?
"If I had been unable
to sleep, ..."
"if I had stayed on deck, ..."
"I could then, perhaps, have seen the assassin
enter or leave Madame Doyle's cabin."
But that is precisely what happened.
She did see the assassin!
And it's because of her greed,
that she now lies dead!
Not much good that does us!
We still don't know who
killed either woman!
No, no, no, that's
not quite right.
You see, we have been running in
the wrong direction, you and I.
We know almost all
there is to know,
except that what we know seems...
seems incredible.
Impossible.
Ah... killings.
Killings!
All the time killings!
Ja, ...
Dead no more than an hour.
The throat's been cut.
With a very thin knife.
One like this.
That's very interesting, Doctor.
Are you quite sure that
none of yours are missing?
Was?
So now you think that I,
Ludwig Bessner, ...
have killed this miserable
little femme de chambre?
Oh, guten himmel!
Why do I have to do with the...
squalid affairs of
the lower classes?
It is well known they do
not have neurosis, ...
just animal passions.
- Take the body to the ice room.
- Yes, sir.
So you think you know, huh?
I must confess, I don't see
any real light myself.
Dr. Bessner has just told me
what's happened to the maid.
I must speak with you
and Mr. Doyle at once.
I wouldn't go in there, if I were you.
Dr. Bessner is rather cross.
My good man, I know that.
But a little kraut crossness
won't stop me now.
You see, I know.
Mr. Doyle, I know who
killed Louise Bourget.
What?
You say you know who
killed Louise?!
Ah, ya, not to shout!
And you, Frau Otterbourne, you
cannot be here, I forbid it.
My patient is resting.
But I must! You see,
it's vitally important!
You see, I know all. All, I tell you!
Now look, I will not take
that pushing with ellbogen.
Mr. Doyle, I tell you that
I, Salome Otterbourne,
have succeeded where
frail men have faltered.
I am a finer sleuth than even
the great Hercule Porridge.
Mrs. Otterbourne, for
god's sake, calm down!
Now tell us the whole story,
from the beginning.
- Well, I refuse to speak in front of him.
- Now look, you will not speak at all, eh?
Now, raus, raus. His temperature is
rising with all this disturbance.
Doctor, it will rise even more if
we don't hear what she has to say.
- Herr Doyle.
- We are talking about the murderer of my wife!
Oh, ja. Ja, all right.
You can stay drei minuten...
Three minutes.
And you, now you
speak softly, eh?
Odious little man!
Madam, do I understand that you have
evidence to show who killed Mrs. Doyle?
You do and I have.
You will agree, will you not?
That whoever killed
Louise Bourget
also killed Linnet Doyle.
That is quite possible.
Well ...
I saw who killed Louise
Bourget with my own eyes.
Pray continue, Madame.
I happened to be in the stern of the
boat talking to one of the crew,
who was showing me a
most intriguing sight:
A buffalo and a camel, yoked
together, tilling the soil.
You saw this by moonlight,
of course, Madame?
Yes, I did.
I have amazingly good eyesight.
Anyway, I left him.
And suddenly, as I
rounded the corner,
I heard a scream.
It came from Louise
Bourget's cabin.
Then, I saw the cabin door open.
As the door opened wider,
I saw that it was...
Pennington's.
I heard a big boom!
What now has happened?
Mrs. Otterbourne's been shot.
- Mr. Pennington?
- Yes?
This is your gun, I believe.
Anybody could have taken
that gun from my cabin,
everybody knew it was there.
I was saying just the other night, I always
carry a gun with me on my travels abroad.
It is time for these
murders to stop.
Already, I have, unfortunately,
delayed too long,
I would like to see everybody,
please, in the saloon,
when all will be revealed.
In, ah ...
thirty minutes?
I can't believe it.
Mother dead.
Why?
- She must have found something out.
- Oh, God! Poor darling!
I loved her, in spite of it all.
And now she's gone.
I can't take it in.
Suddenly I'm...
All alone.
No, you're not.
I'll look after you.
Oh, Jim...
Poor mother.
You'd never have
got away from them.
Not while she was alive.
Madames, mademoiselles,
monsieurs...
the game is over.
I, Hercule Poirot, ...
now know, beyond the shadow of a
doubt, who killed Madame Doyle,
Louise Bourget and
Madame Otterbourne.
Foolishly, I began this investigation
with the preconceived idea
that there must have been a witness
to the shooting scene between...
Mademoiselle Jackie
and Simon Doyle.
That this person must
have taken the gun,
from here, after everyone
had left the saloon,
and must have used it
to kill Madame Doyle,
and to attempt to frame...
Mademoiselle Jackie.
You see, mes amis, it is not
as though there was any
lack of suspects among you.
She might have been killed by someone
trying to shut her defamatory mouth,
or by someone whose father had been
ruined by Madame Doyle's father,
or by someone obsessed with
the idea of robbery,
or by someone who bitterly resented
anyone inheriting that amount of money.
Or by someone who was desperately
trying to save her mother
from financial ruin.
Or yet,
by someone anxious to escape
exposure as a fraudulent trustee.
Or, by someone who simply mistook
the identity of the victim.
And then ...
I remembered something
very important.
On the night of the
killing, I slept heavily,
not lightly, as is my custom.
Why?
Because my wine had been drugged
by someone who did not
wish me to be present
at the night's events.
This was the easiest
thing in the world:
The bottle's stand open on the
dining room table all day long.
You, Mon Colonel,
you even sent the bottle back
saying, to use your own words,
that it was "mouldy".
And this in itself,
plainly implies premeditation
on someone's part.
It means that yesterday
before 7:30, when dinner was served, the
crime had already been decided upon.
Then I began to think back on something that
has been puzzling me from the beginning.
If the intention was to
implicate Mademoiselle Jackie,
why had the gun been removed
from Madame Doyle's cabin?
And then I understood.
The murderer had removed
the gun because he, or...
or she, had to remove it.
There was no other course.
And there was more, ...
Dr. Bessner,
you examined Madame
Doyle's body.
Ja.
You will remember that there were
signs of scorching 'round the wound.
In other words, the gun had been placed
very close to her head before being fired.
That is correct.
But, ... when we recovered
the gun from the Nile
it was wrapped in
this brocade stole.
And had evidently been
fired, through its folds,
presumably in order to deaden
the sound of the shot.
Doctor Bessner,
if it had been fired
through the stole,
there would have been no scorching
on Madame Doyle's temple.
In other words, the shot that killed
Madame Doyle could not have been fired
through the stole.
And then, perhaps, it
was the other one.
The one which Jacqueline de
Bellefort fired at Simon Doyle.
Jackie!
But no, we have a witness for that.
We know it's not so.
Therefore, there
was a third shot.
One of which we know nothing.
But, ...
there were only two shots
missing from the gun.
The next curious circumstance
occurred in Madame
Doyle's cabin.
In it I found two bottles
of coloured nail polish.
One bottle was labelled "Rose",
but the few drops
remaining in that bottle
were not pale pink,
but bright red.
And instead of the usual
smell of pear drops,
vinegar.
Mes amis, it was red ink,
which formed an inevitable link
with this handkerchief
which we found
together with the gun
wrapped up in the stole.
And ink washes easily out of
linen leaving a pale pink stain.
Then something happened
which put the matter
beyond all doubt.
Louise Bourget was killed
because she was
blackmailing the murderer.
We know this not only because of the
fragment of a thousand-franc note
which we found clutched
between her dead fingers,
but also because of some
rather curious words she used
only this morning.
Naturally,
if I'd been unable to sleep...
Naturally, if I had
been unable to sleep,
if I had stayed on deck,
I might then perhaps
have seen the assassin
enter or leave Madame's cabin.
Now, what exactly,
did that tell us?
What, exactly, did
she tell us...
with that?
That she had stayed on deck...
she did see the murderer.
Ye... Yes, but you still fail to see
my point, Mon Colonel, excuse me.
Why did she say that to us?
As a hint?
As a hint, of course,
but why hint to us?
She knows who the murderer is.
All right, she can do one of two things:
She can tell us or else
she can keep quiet...
and demand money from the
person concerned, later.
But she does neither
of these two things.
She uses the conditional
tense if you please:
"If I had been..."
This can mean only one thing:
She's hinting, all right, yes,
but she's hinting...
to the murderer.
In other words, he was
present at that time.
But, apart from you and me,
only one other person was present.
Precisely. Simon Doyle.
What?
Yes.
You are under the constant supervision
of Doctor Bessner. She had to speak then.
- She might not have got another chance.
- Don't be so bloody ridiculous.
Bloody rid... Oh, I don't think I'm being...
I remember very clearly your answer.
"I will look after you."
"No one is accusing
you of anything."
This is exactly the assurance
that she wanted, and...
which she got.
Oh, Mr. P.,
You really have made a fool of
yourself this time, and no mistake.
I mean, I've got plenty of witnesses to prove
that I couldn't possibly have killed Linnet.
I know you have.
But you did kill her,
and Louise Bourget saw you.
Oh, what nonsense!
I tell you that Herr Doyle
could not have moved about the
boat with a fractured leg.
I tell you that I, Ludwig Bessner, would
testify to this to any court in the world.
In that case, I would have to say
that your testimony is irrelevant.
Irrelevant?
Un-an-wend-bar?
Un-anwendbar?
Me?
I have testified
in some of the most complex
psychological cases of the century.
My testimony alone saved
Strutzrumple, ...
The Dresden Sacre-Tor
murderer, from execution.
- And on the case...
- Calmez-vous, Calmez-vous.
I'm only saying that your
testimony is irrelevant
because you started to
tend to Monsieur Doyle
five minutes after
he had been shot.
What I tell you he could not have
moved during those five minutes.
I agree, if he'd been shot at
that time, but had he been?
Consider what had
actually been seen.
Mademoiselle Rosalie saw
Jacqueline fire her pistol.
She saw Doyle collapse
to the floor,
and then turning away to seek help,
she ran into Monsieur Ferguson,
who had heard the shot.
All he saw was Doyle clutching a
red-stained handkerchief to his leg.
He quite naturally assumed
that Doyle had been shot,
but the assumption was wrong.
The bullet had not gone into
Doyle, but... elsewhere.
And now what happens?
Doyle insists that Jackie
be taken away to her cabin
and not be left alone.
And so Jackie is helped to her cabin by
Mademoiselle Rosalie and Monsieur Ferguson.
Then,
Mademoiselle Rosalie goes
to fetch Miss Bowers.
And accordingly all the activity is centred
on the starboard side of the boat.
Miss Bowers!
Two minutes are all
that Doyle needs.
He takes off his shoes,
picks up the gun
from under the sofa,
where Jackie had thoughtfully thrown it, so
that it would be forgotten until later,
and runs like a hare
along the port deck.
He then enters his wife's cabin.
Doyle then takes Madame
Van Schuyler's stole
which he had previously hidden,
and wrapping up the gun in it,
in order both to muffle sound
and to prevent scorching,
fires a bullet into his own leg.
He removes one of the
spent cartridges,
which he disposes of,
and inserts a fresh one
thus indicating, should
the gun be found,
that only two bullets
had been fired from it.
He then rewraps the gun in the stole,
adds the stained handkerchief,
and a marble ashtray to make sure
that it all sinks to the bottom,
and throws the whole bundle out
of the window, into the Nile.
And now he lies back on the sofa,
clasping a fresh handkerchief to his leg,
this time in genuine agony.
C'est extraordinaire, n'est pas?
It's impossible.
I can scarcely believe it.
Of course it is, absolutely
bloody impossible.
Why do you say it's impossible?
You yourself told me that you
heard softly running feet.
What reason was there
for anyone to run?
Yes, I know, but do all that
on the spur of the moment?
Once and for all, Mon Colonel, it
was not on the spur of the moment,
it was carefully planned.
By Doyle?
Oh, Doyle...
He merely acted the part.
It was planned by
his accomplice,
Mademoiselle Jacqueline
de Bellefort.
You must be mad.
No, I'm not mad.
That's the truth.
Who gave Doyle his alibi?
You did, by firing that shot.
And who gave you your alibi?
Doyle,
by insisting that someone
stay with you, all night.
It's not true! It's not!
It is true.
Why bother to deny it?
You and Doyle were lovers.
You still are lovers.
The plan was that Simon
would kill his wife,
inherit the money, and then
afterwards, at some later date,
marry his old love.
It was a very brilliant concept.
Your persecution
of Madame Doyle,
Simon's feigned rage,
your selection of Mademoiselle
Rosalie as a witness,
and all that build
up to the shooting,
the exaggerated hysteria, ...
There was only one
risk you really took:
And that was that Simon's wound,
simply, had to be disabling.
Oh, and, ah, pardon me, but
one piece of foolishness,
which was the... drawing of...
the letter "J" on the
wall of the cabin,
so melodramatic it could
only have one effect:
That of exonerating you.
And who would want
to do that except...
an accomplice?
But then...
the plan began to go wrong,
did it not?
Louise Bourget has been wakeful.
She sees Doyle run
to his wife's cabin,
she hears the shot,
and sees him return
to the saloon.
She makes her greedy
bid for hush money,
and in doing so, signs
her own death warrant.
Herr Doyle could not have killed her,
because he could not have moved.
- I will swear to that.
- You would be right.
She was killed by
Mademoiselle Jackie.
No!
Yes, I am afraid
there is no doubt.
Just before dinner, she asked
to see Monsieur Doyle.
Quite foolishly, as it turns out, I
agreed and brought them together.
The one apparently guilt ridden and
distraught, the other comforting.
Oh, Simon, I'm so
dreadfully sorry.
Now, there now...
However, I'm sure as soon as
we've gone, the tone changes.
It's going fine, darling.
We're nearly there.
Like hell it is!
Louise knows.
She saw me.
She's trying to blackmail us.
I'll have to shut her up.
- Can't we pay her?
- All our lives?
Jackie, are you sure?
Give me some money.
Why?
That's what she's waiting for.
It'll put her off guard. Where is it?
In my jacket. In the wardrobe.
- I love you.
- I know.
- Are we insane?
- Oh, I don't know but we can't stop now.
Jackie...
Wish me luck.
Unfortunately for
her, in her haste,
she leaves a tiny fragment of
a thousand-franc note behind...
clutched in the dead
woman's fingers.
But even more unfortunately,
she is seen by Madame
Otterbourne leaving the cabin.
She is unaware of this at the time and
returns to Dr. Bessner's cabin...
to replace the scalpel.
Then, having changed for dinner,
somewhat flushed and out of breath,
she hurries into
the dining room.
As for Madame Otterbourne,
when she hears of the murder of
Louise Bourget from Dr. Bessner,
she suddenly realizes that she has
actually seen the murderer...
leaving the scene of the crime.
What?
You say you know
who killed Louise?
Calm. Not to shout.
And you, Frau, you cannot be here.
I forbid it...
It seemed strange to
me at the time...
that Doyle should be shouting so
loudly at Madame Otterbourne.
Now, of course, I realize that what he was
doing was shouting a warning to Jackie...
next door.
Mrs. Otterbourne, for
God's sake, calm down.
Now tell us the whole
story, from the beginning.
And why did he ask her to start at the
beginning and tell the whole story?
Obviously, to give
Jackie time to act,
which she did, like lightning.
I say...
But Herr Doyle...!
We are talking about the
murderer of my wife!
Mr. Pennington?
She boasted once that her father
had taught her to be a crack shot,
And her boast was
not an idle one.
I saw it...
She dropped the gun and bolted
into her own cabin next door.
It was highly risky,
but it was her only
possible chance.
Voil√†, mes amis.
That is all.
Congratulations, Mr. P.,
- ...on a highly amusing theory.
- Oh, it's more than a theory.
Unfortunately,
it is the truth.
Then what happened
to the first bullet?
The one that Jackie fired at me?
Oh, that's a good question, yes.
Can you all see this table?
There's a newly made
bullet hole, just there.
Of course, you had time to
dispose of the bullet and...
throw it into the Nile.
- What piffle!
- Oh, no. It's not piffle.
Remember we have proof that
all the three bullets...
came from Mademoiselle
Jacqueline's gun.
Suppose that's true,
Monsieur Poirot.
Why is it proof that Simon
fired the other two?
Well, that's right!
You've no proof.
You've absolutely
no proof at all.
We'll produce some, never fear.
You won't get away with this.
No?
Well, you'll never convince
a jury without proof.
And where do you intend
to get it, Mr. P.?
From Linnet?
Oh, no. Not from Linnet.
From you.
From me? What do you mean?
It's a bluff, Simon.
It's very far from being a bluff.
There is a very simple test...
which is now accepted as conclusive
evidence in any court in the world,
and it's called a
"Moulage test".
"Moulage Test"?
Yes, "Moulage".
You know, when you fire a gun, ...
tiny grains of powder become embedded in
the skin and they can now be removed by...
a thin layer of wax.
That's a "Moulage Test".
Oh, Mon Colonel,
will you administer this?
When you wish.
I assume, of course, that you're
willing to submit to such a test?
There is no pain involved,
just a little ...
warmth.
Jackie, what...?
Can we do?
Nothing.
It's over.
I don't mind so much, Monsieur.
A... about me, I mean.
You do mind, don't you? A bit?
Yes.
And don't judge
Simon too harshly.
He never had any money
and Linnet simply...
dazzled him with
all that wealth.
Simon, do you remember
what you said?
I said if this was a book,
I'd marry Linnet, and she'd die within
a year, and leave me everything.
That's when I saw the
idea come into his head.
I was terrified. I knew he'd try
some perfectly absurd way, ...
he even had the idea of putting
a cobra in her bed.
Well, you found another use
for that serpent, mademoiselle.
I'm glad it didn't
kill you, monsieur.
- Ooof...
- Truly.
So you, ...
you see, ...
I had to help him.
I've always had to help him.
Oh, Jackie, I love you.
I love you.
Stop!
Monsieur Poirot, ...
Quelle trag√©die!
A splendid piece of detecting,
Poirot, I must say.
You know, I couldn't possibly have
carried out that "Moulage Test".
I have no wax.
You ashtonish me, Mon Colonel.
You absolutely ashtonish me.
Goodbye, Monsieur Poirot.
I'm afraid the description of
your cases will have to wait...
until another time.
Oh, quel dommage, Madame!
I was hoping to recount to you my
recent extraordinary experience
on the Orient Express.
Come on, Bowers. Time to go.
This place is beginning
to resemble a mortuary.
Thank God, you'll be in one
yourself, before too long.
- Bloody old fossil.
- Temper, temper, Bowers!
What you need is a
nice cool holiday.
I was thinking of a trip
through the Gobi Desert.
Monsieur Poirot, I wanted you
to be the first to know.
We've just got engaged.
Oh, mes f√©licitations,
mademoiselle.
Monsieur, ...
- Congratulations. And bonne chance to both of you...
- Thank you.
- Goodbye, Monsieur Poirot.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Colonel Race.
- Good luck.
Oh, mes petite!
A word of advice...
As they say in America:
Take it easy.
We'll try.
- What are you thinking?
- I was thinking of Moli√®re.
"La grande ambition des femmes
est d'inspirer I'amour."
I do wish you'd speak
some known language.
"The great ambition of
women is to inspire love."
