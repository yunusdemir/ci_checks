<i>It begins here for me on this road.</i>
<i>How it all happened, I don't know.
But it could never happen again.</i>
<i>Maybe I could have stopped it early.</i>
<i>But once the trouble was on its way,
I was just going with it.</i>
<i>Mostly I remember the girl.</i>
<i>I can't explain it.
A sad chick like that...</i>
<i>But something changed in me.
She got to me.</i>
<i>That's later, anyway.
This is where it begins for me.</i>
<i>Right on this road.</i>
Get off the track!
<i>They're approaching the turn
for the last lap.</i>
<i>Hillman taking a tumble.
Jones is able to avoid him.</i>
<i>This is the final lap,
and still anybody's race.</i>
<i>That's Conners in the hay.
A bad break for Charlie Conners.</i>
<i>They'll go into the last lap.
Last time around coming up.</i>
<i>They're all hot today. It's anybody's
race. Anything can happen.</i>
<i>Maybe a record...</i>
Come on, Al!
Come on!
Hey, get off the track!
Please don't cross the track.
Don't cross the track. Don't get
hurt. Blood makes the road slippery.
What's the matter with you?
Are you in such a big hurry to die?
Are you looking for trouble?
These outlaw outfits
always want to foul things up.
- What kind of outfits?
- Outlaw outfits... like yours.
Okay, square. You want to drag
Johnny here 100 yards for beers?
- The square's chicken.
- They're all chicken.
You want to see Johnny go?
He can really screw it on.
Do you get $5,000 when you win
these scrambles? I'd like that.
If you win, they give you
one of these gold statues.
Solid gold... dipped.
- What do you do with it?
- You throw it away.
Put these trophies back.
Stand back.
Can I get a suit like that? I want
to look like a street cleaner, too.
Who are you?
Are you a cop?
- Don't push anybody.
- Okay, break it up.
That's enough entertainment.
I've seen enough of you guys.
- Hit the road. Get going.
- We want to watch the races, Daddy.
One more cute remark and I'll put
the bunch of you away for a month.
Get going.
- Hey, look what Johnny won.
- What's the matter? Second place?
- Johnny only won second place?
- First place was two feet high.
The squares are having
a dance tonight. We'll go, huh?
- No.
- We can clobber it.
Come on, Johnny. Let's go. Every
time you look around, there's cops.
All right, let's get rolling.
This way.
- Where's that bunch from?
- Everywhere.
I don't even think
they know where they're going.
They make folks think that everybody
that drives a motorcycle is crazy.
They want to be pushed around
so they can show how tough they are.
It'll happen, sooner or later.
- Johnny, where are we going?
- Give us some gas!
Ben, business before pleasure.
Put some more beer on ice.
What war do you suppose
this joint was left over from?
Hey fellas,
who wants to drag for beers?
Last guy in the door buys beers.
Last guy in buys.
- Who is it?
- You all right? It's Art Kleiner.
- Hey, help this man out!
- Hey, help this man out!
Help the man out!
Help the man out!
Put me down!
Help the man out!
- What is all this?
- We were dragging for beer.
- And this guy...
- He doesn't know how to drive.
- There's a boy hurt here.
- His ankle looks pretty bad.
What's all that, Kathy?
Somebody killed?
- Crazy, you can't sleep here.
- You really stacked up this thing.
- We'll take him to Dr Ziegler.
- Harry, you saw how it happened.
They were coming straight at me.
I swung my wheel over, but...
- What about this?
- It was an accident. I saw it.
- Aren't you gonna arrest anybody?
- Take it easy, Art.
I'm just telling you what happened.
My car's a wreck and somebody
has to pay for the damages.
Are you the big cop in town?
Tell him to look where he's going.
He ought to turn
one way or the other.
My guys were trying to miss him.
He's okay, but my boy's busted up.
- Look here...
- Forget it.
- Some cop.
- See Johnny back him down?
Kleiner's too old to be driving.
Where was he going, anyway?
Always going someplace.
Crazy... excited.
Taking a lot of vitamin pills,
drinking... over-stimulated.
Ought to arrest the whole
lot of them. Call the militia.
- Do you want something?
- I'd like a bottle of beer.
- The beer's in the bar.
- All right.
Thank you.
- The fender's scraping in the tyre.
- Wait a minute.
It won't scrape no more.
Oh, no.
Harry, do something about this.
- What do you expect...?
- Do you want all the boys arrested?
You let something like this go by,
and anything goes.
- Make a complaint, Art.
- I will.
That's silly. You're okay.
And it's lucky, the way you drive.
- You live here all the time?
- All my life.
- We've been at the meet.
- They came through here yesterday.
They didn't stop. Is that what
they give you for killing yourself?
That's right.
You want it?
- No.
- Go on, take it.
No. You can't do that.
You won it.
You have to get your name
engraved on it. It's important.
You shouldn't give it away. Only if
you knew a girl, and you liked her.
Hey, Johnny. About this town...
They've got a doc here.
They're gonna rewire Crazy.
Are we just gonna sit around?
Are we gonna wait,
or are we gonna leave?
We're gonna wait for Crazy.
Hey, Johnny says
we're gonna wait for Crazy.
- What do we do here?
- Give me a swig.
There's more where this came from.
It's ice cold, too.
Hey, doc...
Where do we eat?
Bleeker's Cafe.
We'll take good care of you.
- You got some steaks?
- We serve good meat.
<i>- Where's the motel?
- The hotel is over there.</i>
They've got a hotel here.
- Lead me to that brew.
- Check the hot rod.
The fire went out!
How are you doing, blondie?
Where are you going?
Look who's here.
- What'll you have, girls?
- The usual.
- And a couple of beers.
- Put a couple of cases on ice.
- You wanted some glasses.
- Never mind. I'll do it myself.
- Take over here, Jimmy.
- Come on, Jimmy!
- Stop mumbling.
- What do you do for kicks here?
- What time is it?
- Does anything ever happen here?
- Oh, yes. Roses grow...
- Oh, roses grow.
People get married.
Crazy as any place else.
Bugs get on them and cause
trouble, if you don't spray good.
- There's no bugs on you, Jim?
- I mind my own business.
I listen to the radio. Music,
that is. The news excites people.
- Hey, Jim. You like TV?
- That new thing. Television.
Oh, pictures. No, no pictures.
Everything these days is pictures.
Pictures and noise. Nobody knows
how to talk, just grunt at each other.
Where have you been?
Listen, what are you gonna do later?
- I work.
- You've got to goof off, don't you?
- Are you gonna work forever?
- It feels like it.
- What about after you finish up?
- I'm staying as long as we're busy.
It sounds like we'll be busy
until you leave.
Where are you going
when you leave? Don't you know?
- Man, we're just gonna go.
- Just trying to make conversation.
On the weekends
we go out and have a ball.
What do you do?
Do you go on a picnic?
You are too square.
I'll have to straighten you out.
You don't go any one special place.
You just go.
After all week it builds up...
The idea is to have a ball.
If you're gonna stay cool, you've
got to wail, got to make some jive.
- I know what you mean.
- That's all I'm saying.
My father was going to take me
on a fishing trip to Canada once.
- We didn't go.
- Crazy.
Hey Pops,
give me one of those crazy beers.
That was real cool. Fine old
playing. We've got to get this beer.
Thank you, Pops.
- Bop me, Dad.
- I bopped you, Dad. Pops, thumb me.
- That's it. Thumb me.
- Give me some skin. Ooze it out.
- Now elbow us.
- Pops, do you pick up on this jive?
- This crazy music. Dig the rebop?
- What?
- The rebop!
- He's a square. Don't you get this?
You take the brew on the side...
- How about a dance?
- You want to struggle?
You're a daring one.
Hey, can I help you?
Hey, these are keen!
Johnny, get a load of this.
- They're real bells.
- Crazy.
- BRMC, what does it mean?
- Black Rebels Motorcycle Club.
- What are you rebelling against?
- What have you got?
Kathy, aren't they wonderful?
I asked what BRMC means. He said,
"Black Rebels Motorcycle Club".
I asked
what he was rebelling against, -
- and he said, "What have you got?"
- Don't you like to dance?
- I don't dance well.
There's a dance in Carbonville.
You want to go?
Aren't you
Miss... taken about that?
- Oh, my...
- Coffee, please.
Two coffees, please.
- You want to go?
- I can't. Besides, it's silly.
- You just came from Carbonville.
- We'll just go back over there.
Hey, you gentlemen
ordered some coffee.
You ordered some coffee.
The young lady's waiting for you.
- That's a good boy.
- What's with him?
You won something, did you?
That's a nice souvenir to have.
Out there,
you got me a little wrong.
I've got a job to do,
but I'm not hard to get along with.
It's just a misunderstanding, but
it could develop into real trouble.
It can be decided, if folks
just sit down and talk it over.
Dad...
Would you like me
to fix you a steak sandwich?
No.
Why did you do that?
Why are you trying to be so rude?
I don't like cops.
Let's get out of here.
- Did you get lined up with her?
- No, her father's that itchy cop.
- Let's get out of this town.
- I'd like to get a cop's daughter.
One beer,
and a sidecar for my friend.
- Crazy got his clutch overhauled.
- How's the foot?
Dig that hat, daddy-o.
What are you doing tonight?
Hey, the Rebels are here!
It looks like Johnny's here.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- Johnny, this joint's wide open.
No, it's a drag.
Come on.
Hi, sweetheart. What are
you doing in this miserable gully?
I've been looking for you all over,
hoping you were dead.
Chino's giving him the needle.
You've been having yourself a time,
huh, Johnny?
You do look pale.
Are you taking care of yourself?
- Do you stay out too late at night?
- That's mine, Chino. Take it off.
Don't do that.
That's better, Johnny.
I missed you. Ever since
the club split up, I missed you.
We all missed you. Did you miss him?
All the Beetles missed you.
Let's have a beer and I'll beat
the living Christmas out of you.
For old times' sake.
Don't take that away from Chino.
It's so beautiful.
Chino needs it.
It makes him feel big and strong.
Chino wants to be a racetrack hero.
All these girls...
I didn't win it. But I stole it
off a guy that didn't win it either.
You want one?
Go steal one someplace for yourself.
Wait a minute.
This is the main event.
Ladies and gentlemen...
This lovely young lady shall hold
this object signifying nothing.
Watch closely. See how the maiden
clutches the gold to her breast.
And see how she fights back a tear
while her hero bleeds to death.
Get up, you big hero.
- What are they fighting about?
- They don't know themselves.
Stop this. You have to get tough
with these hoodlums, or you're sunk.
<i>You are the cop. If you can't boot
them out, we'll bust a few heads.</i>
- That won't help matters.
- Take it easy.
Nothing but talk. I'll see
if everything is all right at home.
Chino, come on. Don't let him
make a fool out of you.
Go get him.
Johnny, I love you.
How about we go and have a...
Shut up! Let's have a beer, Johnny.
Shut up, I said!
- Get out of the way.
- Shut up!
- I want out of here.
- You're awful noisy.
Get away.
- What did he do?
- Tried to run Meatball over.
Come on, up and over!
Break it up.
Break it up.
- He tried to run Meatball over.
- He ran his motorcycle into my car.
Yeah? And then his cycle
crawled under your front wheel?
<i>- I want this man arrested.
- He wants me arrested?</i>
- He hit me.
- Hit me back, you coward.
Quiet!
I'm gonna lock you both up.
So we can all talk
without everybody yelling. Quiet!
Whether I'll hold anybody depends
on how badly this boy is hurt.
- Are you hurt, man?
- He don't feel a thing.
- Let me talk to you.
- Break it up. Move along.
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Of course.
- Let's get these guys out of town.
- We have to make a living here.
If you arrest Charlie Thomas,
he'll never forgive you.
- Come on.
- What about him?
Frogface, we are being parted.
Our love is being nipped in the bud.
What did this boy do
that frogface didn't do?
Johnny, I want to talk to you.
I've given you a couple of chances.
- I don't know what you're after.
- Let me tell you about Johnny.
I'm in a spot here.
Do me a favour.
You take your boys and go.
- Can I go too?
- Yes.
I made a deal with a cop once.
Let me tell you about Johnny.
He don't like nobody on his back.
We had the same club once, and
the Beetles got on his back a lot.
- Then you won't do what I say?
- Save me. I'm going to the can.
- I don't make no deal with no cop.
- Okay. Come on.
Hey, Johnny,
tell my mom I'm in the can!
Don't let that cop
get away with this.
And tell her to send me a case
of beer. Oh, the shame of it all!
- Let's give this joint the needle.
- Where's the chick who has my gold?
She was standing right over there.
- Hi, Johnny.
- Thank you.
Hey, Johnny.
Don't you remember? Britches...
The last weekend we went
scrambling. Before the club split up.
- How have you been?
- I'm still swinging.
I didn't know what happened to you.
It's been a year I didn't see you.
- I thought about you.
- I'll see you later, okay?
Where's my gold?
I'm gonna blow this joint.
Go someplace else and make trouble.
- Why didn't he lock up frogface?
- He was afraid of making a mistake.
He was afraid of losing his job.
He's the town joke, and I'm stuck
with him. He shouldn't be a cop.
He's a fake, like you.
You've impressed everybody now,
big motorcycle racer.
You should give that back.
Say what?
You're just a girl
who makes sandwiches.
Your father's an important man,
and you tell me what to do?
Nobody tells me what to do.
You keep needling me and
I'm gonna take this joint apart.
- Hey, beer.
- Johnny, are we leaving?
Not just yet.
- Johnny, let's go spring Chino.
- Let's get him out of there.
We've got this town on the ropes.
Dorothy,
get me the Sheriff's Office.
I'll see if I can get through.
Hey, look what's in here.
Hello, baby.
- How does this work?
- Can I get my mother on there?
- This is Dorothy. Help!
- Hello...
Goodbye, Dorothy.
Take the day off, Dorothy.
What is this?
What are you doing?
Get off my lawn!
You've caused enough trouble.
Hey, Chino!
Get up, Chino.
- Let's open it up.
- I've got the key!
- Look. No fingerprints.
- Hurry up.
Hey, Chino.
Come on, get up.
- Let him sleep it off.
- Do you want a wake-up call?
Sleep well.
He'll be surprised when he wakes up.
- Let's go give that cop a bad time.
- I'll take his daughter.
- Okay, I was smiling.
- Maybe she has a sister.
Johnny, where are you going?
Hello...
Hello, hello...
- Don't they answer?
- Did you get them?
The phone is dead.
Send somebody for the militia.
Let me try.
Hello, operator... operator...
Dorothy...
I guess you're right.
- Go tell your dad I need him.
- You better go home and stay there.
- Hi, Johnny. Where have you been?
- What do you want?
Talk to me, Johnny.
Sing me a song.
- Buy me a beer.
- You've got a beer.
I want to know how you've been.
I'm really singing tonight.
I'm on the Christmas tree.
- You got a date?
- Yeah.
Remember the night? The first time
I went scrambling with the Rebels.
That was the first time I saw you.
I haven't seen you since.
We really got ourselves
hung on the Christmas tree.
Boy, was I green.
I thought I was living it up. I had
a guy and we were really gonna go.
We had a lot of yaks anyway,
didn't we?
Say it.
Can't you say something?
Please, Johnny.
I won't get on your back.
I wouldn't do that. But we
had a lot of yaks anyway, didn't we?
What do you want, flowers?
- Where's that girl Kathy?
- The bar's closed. Everything is.
- Hey, Johnny, can't you stop them?
- Where's Kathy?
- I don't know. Can you stop this?
- I don't stop nothing.
- They're wrecking my place.
- You're doing all right.
- Are you all right, Charlie?
- Anybody bring a gun for me?
- Wait a minute.
- Wait till somebody gets killed?
- We've got to protect ourselves.
- Two wrongs never made a right.
- If you use guns...
- I'm gonna use it.
You can either stay and talk with
Bill here, or you can come with me.
Find him and meet us at the store.
Let's get hold of this Johnny
before the others do.
Hey, Crazy, let's go, go, go!
That Mildred gives crazy permanents.
- Let's dance.
- I've been tapped.
Guys, look!
New talent.
- Well...
- Let's get it!
Please don't do this.
It's too expensive.
Let's dance, sweetie.
- Hey! The chick!
- Johnny's girl! Let's get her!
Get on.
Get up.
I'm sorry, I can't fight back.
I'm too tired. It would be better.
Then you could hit me.
You think you're too good for me.
Anybody who thinks that,
I'll knock over sometime.
I can hit you to show you how good
you are, and tomorrow I'll be gone.
- Do you want to?
- I don't waste my time on squares.
- I'll take you back and dump you.
- Johnny...
It's crazy.
You're afraid of me.
I'm not afraid of you now.
You're afraid of me.
I'm afraid of you? Are you cracked?
Come on, get on.
I wanted to touch you.
I wanted to try, anyway.
- Try what?
- I don't know.
I wanted to make it like I thought
it would be... with somebody.
The way I thought it might be.
You're still fighting, aren't you?
You're always fighting.
Why do you hate everybody?
I've never ridden on a motorcycle
before. It's fast. It scared me.
But I forgot everything.
It felt good. Is that what you do?
I'm gonna leave.
That's what you want, isn't it?
You know what I used to think
about a lot after my mother died?
That somebody would come here
and stop at Uncle Frank's place...
...buy a cup of coffee.
He'd like me and take me with him.
You were going to give me that
statue. Will you give it to me now?
- Why?
- I don't know.
I just wondered if you still
wanted to give it to me. It's crazy.
Where did you want
this guy to take you?
Wherever he was going, I guess.
I'm shaky.
I wish I was going someplace.
I wish you were going someplace.
We could go together.
- Johnny, Johnny!
- Hey...
What's the matter?
Chino, how did you get out?
Let's have a beer, and I'll beat
the living Christmas out of you.
- We're gonna get out of here.
- Storm the bastille!
There he comes!
That's him!
Dad, they've got Johnny.
They're taking him...
- Aren't you gonna do anything?
- There isn't anything to do.
We have to help him. They took him
in a car, Mr Thomas and some men.
He was trying to stop it.
He was going to leave.
- How are things at Frank's?
- There was a fight. I came for you.
- Uncle Frank is very upset.
- He got what he wanted.
- Business before pleasure.
- They've gone crazy. Everybody.
They've got Johnny.
They're going to beat him up.
I tried to talk to him.
<i>- Don't you even care?
- What can I do?</i>
Nothing. But if you don't do
something, you're worse than them.
They brought it on themselves. I
saw it coming, but what could I do?
Charlie Thomas is a bully.
He was a bully in the third grade.
Am I supposed to shoot somebody?
- Charlie, let me talk to him.
- Stay out of this. Get away.
- My father hit harder than that.
- Shut up.
Hold on, there.
- Get away from that boy. Get back.
- We've got a little job to do here.
- This is my job.
- Not for long.
We're pounding some respect for law
and authority into his thick skull.
- That's not the way to do it.
- You've got a better way?
Harry, you're too soft-hearted.
This is no time for kindness.
- It's as good a time as any.
- He won't try this again soon.
I don't know what he's tried.
This boy's in my custody.
He'll get his punishment
in the right way, and not from you.
Now, now, Harry.
Take it easy. We're all old friends.
- Let's be calm and talk it over.
- Let's talk this over, Harry.
That's him!
What's going on?
- Get him up.
- We'll really fix him for this.
Finally killed a man, huh?
What's the idea?
Let's go.
How did this get started?
We had this stopped
when he interfered.
All right.
We'll find out what happened.
Round up everybody on a motorcycle.
- The old man is dead.
- That makes it manslaughter.
We'll see.
Let's sort it out inside.
20 years is too good for him. I knew
he was the ringleader right away.
I knew someone would get killed,
but nobody listened.
You killed Jimmy with talk, as sure
as he killed him with a motorcycle.
Okay. That's enough.
Now, stop it. That's all.
Well, son, you've got yourself
some real important trouble.
It just shows you what a boy can do
if he'll work at it.
Haven't you anything to say?
I didn't kill nobody. Those guys
were after me and I just took off.
Maybe something hit my cycle.
I don't know what happened.
Then I went out. That's all.
Well...
Let's go.
I located my daughter.
Do you want to talk to her?
- No. Bring her in later.
- You better talk to her now.
I've got a long drive home
before I can get this joker booked.
- But she was with the boy.
- He knows...
Shut up.
All right. Come in, sit down.
That'll be all.
- Kathy's my niece. I should stay.
- All right, but keep quiet.
- Well?
- It's crazy.
I've got one fact. A man's dead,
and our boy here is stuck with it.
- I don't think it was his fault.
- Do you know?
No.
You haven't fallen for this fellow,
have you?
No.
No, I couldn't.
Let's go.
They beat him up.
I saw them.
- I know he was leaving. He just...
- Yes, I know.
Sheriff, listen...
- Wait, please.
- She's upset. She didn't mean that.
That boy deserves
everything he gets.
- Art here saw her fighting him off.
- No, he's wrong. He helped me.
- They were after me and...
- She tried to get away from him.
Not from him.
I was just trying to get away.
- Maybe we better tell him, Frank.
- Tell me what?
Art and I were coming up the street.
We didn't see who threw it, -
- but a tyre iron either hit the boy
or the motorcycle, and it went wild.
- Who threw what?
- A tyre iron. It's a...
- The thing to take a tyre off.
- Yeah. It landed at our feet.
Why didn't you say so before?
Sit down.
John Strabler.
Do you have any friends, Johnny?
You picked up a few around here
last night, strange as it seems.
They got you off the hook
for a while.
I don't get your act at all.
And I don't think you do, either.
I don't think you know what you're
trying to do, or how to do it.
I think you're stupid.
Real stupid and real lucky.
Last night you scraped by,
just barely.
But a man's dead on account of
something you let get started.
I don't know if there is any good in
you, if there's anything in you, -
- but I'm gonna take a big chance,
and let you go.
There'll be a hearing on this tyre
iron business. You'd better show up.
Put him on the road.
Is that yours?
Go ahead.
Don't you want to say anything
to these people?
Don't you know when you're getting
a break? At least say thank you.
It's all right.
He doesn't know how.
The fun is over.
You're all down in my book,
and all the damage will be paid for.
You've got ten minutes to clear out.
Stick your nose back in this county,
and you'll never see daylight again.
Coffee.
