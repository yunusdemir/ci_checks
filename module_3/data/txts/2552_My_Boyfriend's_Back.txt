<i>[Boy]Allmylife I've been</i>
<i>in love with Missy McCloud.</i>
<i>That's her, back at her</i>
<i>first grade birthdayparty.</i>
<i>Even at the age ofsix,</i>
<i>Missy was the kind ofgirl...</i>
<i>that everyonejust liked</i>
<i>being around, me especially.</i>
<i>That's me in the back, with the</i>
<i>little red fireman's hat on.</i>
<i>And</i> that <i>is the most amazing</i>
<i>present in the world.</i>
<i>It took me almost a year</i>
<i>to save up enough to buy it.</i>
<i>And when she opened it, I was sure</i>
<i>she'd fall helplessly in love with me.</i>
- <i>It couldn't fail.</i>
- I love it.
<i>Johnny, don'tyou have</i>
<i>something for Missy?</i>
<i>[Johnny Narrating ]</i>
<i>This was it, my golden moment.</i>
<i>In front of everyone, the most</i>
<i>exotic creature alive...</i>
<i>would fall totally in love</i>
<i>with me, forever.</i>
<i>I had the confidence.</i>
<i>I had the gift.</i>
- Well, son?
- <i>But I wimped out.</i>
<i>[ Woman ]</i>
<i>All right, kids, cake time!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>
[ Kids Laughing, Shouting ]
What are you

Here, honey,
you sit there.
<i>[Woman ]</i>
<i>Make a wish.</i>
- <i>Happybirthday!</i>
- <i>[Man ] That's mygirl.</i>
<i>[Johnny Narrating] Over the next</i>
<i>12years, I</i> lusted <i>after Missy.</i>
<i>She filled out</i>
<i>in all the right places...</i>
<i>the ones I'd been reading about</i>
<i>in the</i> National Geographic.
<i>The more she grew up, the more</i>
<i>helplessly in love I became.</i>
<i>That was the problem.</i>
<i>Well, you know what theysay:</i>
<i>love makes you do crazy things.</i>
<i>Well, my love for Missy drove me</i>
<i>to do the most unimaginable thing...</i>
<i>one human being can do to another,</i>
<i>but that comes later.</i>
<i>My story begins at the end of</i>
<i>my senioryear in high school...</i>
<i>on the historic day after Missy broke up</i>
<i>with Buck Van Patten...</i>
<i>her boyfriend</i>
<i>for the last sixyears.</i>
<i>I was ecstatic.</i>
<i>This day was the beginning</i>
<i>ofthe end ofmy life.</i>
<i>[Alarm Ringing ]</i>

[ Groans ]
Huh.

Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
- What's your hurry there, son?
- Today I'm going to ask...
the most perfect girl
in the world to the prom.
Oh, you're going to ask
your own mother, eh?
[ Giggles ]
Oh, you.
Sit down, honey.
Breakfast is ready.
- No time, Mom.
- Always time for a good breakfast.
- You're absolutely right.
- A donut isn't breakfast.
It's fine, Ma.
Where's the vitamin C?
Where's the fiber?
<i>[Johnny]</i>
<i>I'll eat on the way.</i>

Hey, Missy. I just wanted to say

in a physically perfect,

- Thanks.
- Extinguish all talking.
<i>Nowwho can tell me</i>
<i>howheroes are created?</i>
- Gerald?
- Th-That's a tricky question.
I don't think heroes are born,
I think they're made.
They're normal men faced with
extraordinary circumstances.
My personal hero
is Jane Goodall.
When shewas born she didn't know
anything about apes and their culture...
- <i>but as she grew,</i>
<i>shestudiedreallyhard</i>--
- Hey, Tiger.
- You talkin' to me?
- Mm-hmm.
I know thatyou've been really concerned
lately thatyou're still a virgin...
and you don't have
a date to the prom.
And thatyou're
sexually stupid.
But those things,
they mean nothing to me.
I loveyou just thewayyou are.

Okay, shoot.
- Are you trying to hypnotize me?
- No, no, um.
No, what I want
to askyou is this:
sinceyou're not
seeing Buck anymore...
I was wondering if
maybeyou'd like to go--
- <i>[Buck ] Make way!</i>
- <i>##[Marching]</i>
Move.
Move!
Buck, what areyou doing?
What is this?
- I am so sorry. I'm an idiot.
- Well, no kidding.
You stand me up, and then
you don't even call me.
My car broke down.
I had towalk eight miles through
the rain to get to a telephone.
- <i>When I got there,</i>
<i>you were alreadygone.</i>
- Really?
I would walk on glass...
and eat donkeys foryou.
I can't live knowing
thatyou're not mine.
Will you go
to the prom with me?
Of course I will, silly.
I'm sorrytoo.
Let's not fight anymore.
<i>[Bell Rings]</i>
What's up, Dingle? Nice zit.
Seeyou,Johnny.
- What areyou lookin' at, dirtbag?
- Nothing.
Well, that blew ropy goat

It's not over.
<i>[JohnnyNarrating] That's when</i>
<i>I came up with theplan that</i>
<i>would change mylife forever.</i>
<i>Andit could have worked too.</i>
<i>It was swashbuckling,</i>
<i>romantic, daring.</i>
- All right, let me see it.
Let me see it.
- This is absurd.
<i>[Johnny Narrating]</i>
<i>Unfortunately, it depended on Eddie.</i>
All right, give me all your money.
That was it?
That was menacing?
All right, news flash.
This just in,Johnny.
Missy is going to the prom
with Buck. You got it?
Look, you pretend to kill her,
I save her life...
she thinks I'm a hero, ditches Buck
and goes to the prom with me.
How sweet is that?
This is desperate

Nice to meetyou,
Johnny Dingle.
Oh, look atyou.
You're a mess.
Just crawled out
ofthe grave, did you?
- I guess so.
- Isn't that something.
Been a long time since anybody
came back from the dead.
I think the last time
was Thanksgiving, 1 5 years ago.
Hey, wait a minute. Did you say
come backfrom the dead?
Yes. You're now one
ofthe undead,Johnny Dingle.
Doomed to spend the rest ofyour days
shunned bythe human race.
- Whoa, whereyou going?
- Home.
No, you're not. That's what I'm trying
to tell you,Johnny Dingle.
You can't ever leave
the cemetery again.
I'm not gonna live in the cemetery
the rest ofmy life.
I got a date Friday night.
I'm very sorry. You'll
have to breakthe date.
You're crazy. I'm going to the prom
with Missy McCloud.
I'm sure she's very nice,
butyou still can't leave.
Only death awaits you
among the living.
- I am among the living.
- You're undead.
Hey, look,just because
I crawled out ofa grave...
doesn't mean
I'm a friggin' zombie.
It does ifyou were dead
beforeyou went into the grave.
Okay, look, I admit
maybe I got shot...
- but I didn't die.
- You're very unreasonable.
<i>Excuse me. Where doyou</i>
<i>thinkyou're going?</i>
How could I be dead?
I've never felt better in my life.
- [ Chuckles ]
- I'm in love.
- I feel great.
- No,J-Johnny!
- Ifyou leave, you'll--
- I'll what?

- Thanks.
- Areyou hungry? Doyou
want something to eat?
Gee, there's a lot offood
left over from the funeral.

pale this morning, son.
- I'm dead, Dad.
How about some eggs?
- Not hungry.
- <i>Not hungry, hesays. Didyou hearhim?</i>
- Haveyou got a temperature?
- Of course not.
I just told you,
I'm dead.
Well, I'm calling Emille Bronson.
I am not going to Dr. Bronson.
I'm not that desperate.
Ho, ho, ho, ho! I guess I know oneyoung

<i>Hello, Dr. Bronson.</i>
<i>This is Marge Dingle.</i>
Dr. Bronson, the reason I called

- Yeah, I'm here.
Johnny Dingle? Oh.
<i>[Students Gasping]</i>
Hi, buddy. Hey!
Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Cooper.
You wouldn't believe

- But--
Just becauseyou're dead does
not mean thatyou can come

Uh, listen, you know,
I think it's really great...
thatyou're back from the dead
and all, but I've got gym.
- But wait a minute.
- <i>[Girl] Is that him?</i>
- <i>Yeah!</i>
<i>[Eddie]Look,</i>
<i>maybeshe's uncomfortable...</i>
because, you know,
you are recently deceased.
- Eddie, come on, be serious.
- I am serious,Johnny.
I'm just dead. It's not like
I'm an asshole or anything.
I didn't say
you were an asshole.
It's just that some people
might consider being dead
somewhat... unfashionable.
- That's really shallow ofyou, Eddie.
- Shut up and eatyourfood.
God! I can't eat this.
It's disgusting.
You neverthought itwas
disgusting before.
This is totally different. They must
have done something weird to it.
Ifyou don'twant it, I'll eat it.
- [ Screams ]
- What?
What doyou mean, "What?" You just
tried to take a bite out ofmy arm!
Oh, I'm sorry, Eddie.
Itwas just gonna be a little bite.
Johnny, you shouldn't
be taking any bites.
- Here, let me--
- No, no, no!
You just get the hell
away from my arm.
Seeyou.
- Missy, hey.
- [ Groans ]
I just want to know what time
I should pickyou up forthe prom.
Um, you shouldn't.
- What doyou mean?
- I have to go.
Wait a minute. Areyou mad 'cause
I tried to take a bite out of Eddie?
- Oh, no, of course not.
- Then what's wrong?
You're not breaking
our date, areyou?
- I came back from the dead
for this date.
- Well, gee,Johnny...
it's just, I really didn't
expectyou to make it.
Well, I wouldn't have asked
ifl couldn't make it.
I'm sorry.
<i>[Guy]Hey, look,</i>
<i>it's that deadkid.</i>
It's because I'm dead, isn't it?
- That's whyyou won't go out with me.

people might say, aren'tyou?
Behind your back, everybodywhispering,
"There goes Missywith the dead kid."
Look, that has nothing
to dowith it, okay?
I only said I would go to the prom
with you becauseyou were dying.
- I'm Buck's girlfriend.
- All right then,

- How about a movie? Johnny.
- Hi there.
- Buck, hi.
- Hi.

Okay, well, you're dead...
which is unusual because we

- Let's look atyour symptoms.
- I'm decaying.
Oh, good.
Symptom number one: decay.
All right.
Is thatyour ear, then?
It fell offabout 20 minutes ago.
May I see it?
It's still in good shape.
It's just not on my head.
Hello? Hello?
I'm just teasing.
- May I keep it?
- <i>No way!</i>
Well, I need skin samples
so I can run some tests.
Well... here.
- [ Skin Ripping ]
- Well, that's very disgusting,
but I guess that'll do fine.
Isn't there, um, some kind ofmedicine
I could takewhileyou lookat that?
- A shot or something?
- To avoid decaying?
- Yes!
- No.
Everything that is dead
eventually decays.
Oh, my god.
Wait, wait.
I do think maybe I--
- Aha!
- <i>"Aha" what?</i>
I think I can helpyou
with that ear.
- You want me to glue it on?
- Well, it's either that

stop that from happening.
Oh,Johnny, I--
I haven't talked about zombies

I need to live long enough to go to the
prom tomorrow night. I'll do anything.
- Oh, no, don't be so quick to--
- Anything.
Oh, my dear boy,
you don't understand.
There is something you can do...
but it is a terrible thing.
Tell me.

Flesh ofthe living.
The moreyou eat,
the more timeyou have.
Areyou crazy?
There's nothing else
you can do.
There's got to be.
Look, I almost took a bite out
ofmyfriend Eddie and itwas
such thewrong thing to do.
He's very mad.
- A bitewill giveyou about 20 minutes.
- Twenty minutes?
- <i>I needa whole day.</i>
- Then you'll have to eat a little more.
- How much more?
- <i>Oh, mygoodness, it's hard to say.</i>
An arm, a leg,
a stomach, a foot.
<i>It's not an exactscience,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

<i>but it's an awfulprice topay.</i>
Well, it doesn't matter because

- Oh, hi.
<i>[Missy]Doyourememberlastnight</i>
<i>when we were in the car...</i>
- and your ear-- you know, it--
- Fell off?
Right. Well, that got me to wondering.
What ifyour other
earwere to fall off?
Uh-huh.
Well, then, what ifother stuff
started falling off.
- I don't know, like
your arms or something.
- Yeah.
Well, then ifstuff
just kept falling off...
- pretty soon--
- I'd just be a little pile ofstuff.
Right.
Sowhat I was wondering is ifsomething
like that might actually happen?
Ifit did wouldyou
feel different towards me?
Is thatwhat's gonna
happen toyou,Johnny?
It's--
It's a definite possibility.
Oh, god.
You are so different from any
other guy I have ever known.
Buckwould kill me ifhe found out
I was going outwith you.
You're decaying and--
Still, god, I wish
you weren't dead.
Me too.
You know, I've never kissed

from Fairview High School wherewejust
received word that some sort oftragic--
- Excuse me. Sheriff McCloud.
- I'm gonna have to askyou all--
We just received word that some
sort oftragedy has happened
in the high school today.
- Uh, no, nothing unusual.
- I was referring to the slaughter.
- Right. Well, therewas that.
- Sheriff--
Earlier today one ofthe students
got badly killed.
We've heard reports that
the murderer might have been
1 7-year-old Johnny Dingle.
I'm going to make
an official statement here.
Johnny Dingle is dead. Okay?
Yes, but then this wouldn't
be the first time...
that someone has come back
from the dead in Fairview...
to wreak havoc
on an innocent victim.
What is a zombie and how can you tell if
there's one living in your neighborhood?
- <i>[Intercom Buzzes]</i>
- Ooh!
- <i>[Woman]Emille?</i>
- What is it?
- <i>You have apatient.</i>
- I'm busy.
<i>It's Chuck Bronski.</i>
<i>He was eaten in school today.</i>
All right, all right,
I'll have a look at him.
But while I'm doing that, I wantyou
to go out and find me a live chicken.
- <i>A chicken?</i>
-Just do it!
All right.
Hello, Chuck. My name is Doctor Bronson.
How arewe doing today?
<i>Isee.</i>
Chuck, you've suffered
a lot ofbleeding...
and there's an ax in your head...
and it appears that someone
has eaten your stomach.
Pulse is a little lowerthan I'd like.
Let's just take a look
atyour retinal response.
Oh, hi. You must be
Big Chuck Bronski.
Hello.
<i>[Big Chuck]</i>
<i>Oh, mygod!</i>
<i>[DoctorBronson]I havesome</i>
<i>badnews. Yourboyis verysick.</i>
He's lost a massive
amount ofblood...
and his pulse and retinal
response are poor...
and, as you can see, there's
an ax sticking out ofhis head.
- He's not sick, you idiot, he's dead!
- Oh, everybody's a doctor!
You think maybe I could
make the diagnosis?
- [ Groaning ]
- It's like somebody ate him!
What kind ofa monsterwould do that
to another human being?
- Mom!
- <i>[Dog Barks]</i>
- Here.
- I have a big problem.
-John, you have a visitor.
- Oh, hey, Eddie.
Look, about today, that wasn't
entirely my fault.
Oh, it's not just today.
It's yesterdaytoo.
- What happened yesterday?
- You tried to eat my arm, pal!
Oh, I thinkyou owe
someone an apology.
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.
Just--Just don't try
to eat me anymore, all right?
- I promise.
- Still buds?
- Huh?
- Yeah, still buds.
Ah, that's what I like to hear.
Hi, honey.
Hi, sweetie.
Oh, son, did you by any chance
murder a boy in school today?
- It wasn't murder. It was an accident.
- Well, I hopeyou didn't eat him.
- [ Parents Make Kissing Sounds ]
- 'Cause lunch is in five minutes...
and I picked up something special
foryou at the supermarket.
Oh, boy!
- Hi.
- Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
- Mmm!
- You picked up a little kid!
<i>[Mother]Am I wrong, or doyou</i>
<i>have to eat the flesh ofthe living?</i>
Mom, I absolutely
can't do that anymore!
Well, there are hungry people all over
the world who'd be thrilled to eat him.
Yeah, my mom says that
to me all the time.
<i>[Johnny]Come on,</i>

- <i>[Doorbell Chimes]</i>
- Uh, I'll get it.
Oh, shit!
[ Humming ]
- Mr. Dingle?
- <i>Yes?</i>
I understand thatyour boy
is a zombie.
-Mm-hmm, yes, that's right.
-Well, he killed and ate my boytoday...
so me and some ofthe other guys
decided to come over and talk to him.
Uh, hold on. Honey!

Uh, I don't want them

<i>that didn't matter.</i>
<i>What mattered was I was gonna</i>
<i>have the dance I'd been waiting</i>
<i>for since the first grade.</i>
<i>That much I was sure of. But</i>
<i>still, nothing could've prepared</i>

<i># When the sky</i>

<i># There's no turnin'back</i>

our dance, sweetie.

<i>[Wind Howling]</i>
<i>[Thunderclap ]</i>
<i>[Man ]</i>
<i>Ah, thereyou are.</i>
- <i>You.</i>
- What? What?
<i>We've been waiting!</i>
- For me?
- <i>Ofcourse foryou...</i>
you dumb sloat.
You see anyone else who was supposed
to be here <i>four</i> days ago?
Hey, look, I'm, uh--
I'm really sorry. I-I didn't know
anybodywas waiting.
When you die, you are supposed
to come <i>directlyhere...</i>
where we pass judgement...
<i>andsendyou to Heaven or Hell.</i>
You are not supposed to climb
out ofthe grave, muck around
on Earth waiting to die...
a second time!
I-I-I didn't plan that,
itjust happened.
Sorry about all theyelling.
Here's the situation:
There's been a little mistake.
What kind ofmistake?
The fact is...
you weren't actually supposed to die
in the convenience store.
- [Yells ] What?
- No, no,just calm down. It's all here.
May 28th, 8:33 p.m.:
Robber enters convenience store,
threatens Missy McCloud.
She attempts to stop robbery.
Robberturns to shoot her,
in doing so knocks over
a pot of coffee with his elbow.
- Wait a minute!
- Mm-hmm?
Hewas supposed
to slip on coffee?
Supposed to, but... didn't.
It doesn't happen very often
but somewhere someone
screwed up and the result is...
a sad, tragic mistake.
The result is I'm dead!
Wheneverwe...
make a mistake...
we try to rectify it by giving the person
a second chance on life;
<i>a chance toprove their worth.</i>
That accounts for the existence
ofthe occasional zombie.
What they do when back...
<i>from the dead determines what</i>
<i>we do with them in the afterlife.</i>
Hey, look. I wanna talk to you
about Chuck. He was practically
dead before I ate him.
I'm sorry. It's time
you were on yourway.
- On myway to where?
- To whereyou belong,
Johnny Dingle.
To whereyou belong.
<i>[Pounding Gavel]</i>
<i>Next.</i>
<i>[WindHowling, Thunderclap]</i>
- Hi,Johnny.
- Hey.
All right, gimme all your money
or I'll blowyour damn brains out.
Don'tworry.
Everything will be okay.
Let's go!
Let's go!
[ Cocks Gun ]
<i>Look out!</i>
[ Grunting ]
- <i>[Missy]Johnny!</i>
- <i>[Johnny Groaning]</i>
- <i>[ Glass Cracking]</i>
- [ Groans ]
Now he knocks
over the coffee.
- Oh, god,Johnny.
- [ Pants ]
Ever since the first grade I've been
desperately in love with you.
You're the kindest, smartest,
most beautiful girl I've ever known.
And after I'm gone...
I justwantyou to know thatyou
meant more to me... than life itself.
I loveyou, Missy.
You're not shot.
What?
<i>[Jingling Chain]</i>
The bullet hit this thing
you werewearing.
You tried to sacrifice
your life for me.
You'd have done
the same for me.
Trust me... I know.
