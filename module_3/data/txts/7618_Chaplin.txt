Why is my heart so light?
Why are the stars so bright?
Why is the sky so blue
Since the hour I met you?
Flowers are smiling bright
Smiling for our delight
Smiling so tenderly
For the world, you and me
I know why the world is smiling
Smiling so tenderly
I have no design for living:
no philosophy.
Whether sage or fool,
we must all struggle with life.
We who have lived
a little longer...
become a little more
estranged...
as we journey on our way.
Christmas 1977
has brought sadness.
Early this morning...
with the death
of Charles Spencer Chaplin...
the world of films lost one of
its greatest artists.
Time isn't that important to me.
I remember him always
with a tinge of...
of sadness.
He was a... he was a sweet man.
The happiest thing
which happened in his life...
is meeting my mother.
I think that if he'd gone on
making silent films...
he would have seemed like
a pioneer once again.
He seemed to be happy.
A little bit out of touch,
but that was quite charming.
I was always impressed
by his humble nature...
by his true modesty...
and by his sincerity.
He really did love
his children...
but I had a lot of problems
with him...
when I started growing up.
And I think that's because
his own, um...
his own background was
very different from...
from his children's background.
I was working on a film,
and I said...
"My father's dying.
Can I go home?"
It was Christmas,
so we weren't shooting.
And they said, "No, you can't.
You're making a movie".
So I couldn't go home.
I couldn't say good-bye to him.
I remember the images...
the sort of dark images...
of the body being put down
into the earth.
He had a great life,
and I think, you know...
you couldn't ask for
anything more.
For my mother,
it was completely different.
I mean, she really...
She'd lost someone who,
you know...
counted enormously for her...
and she was very...
We were just thinking of her
at the time, I think.
We weren't used to having people
standing round...
watching us work.
It was at the end, when
the photographers turned up...
that it got a bit annoying.
Everything happened
very quickly...
so the time you realize it
and it can sink in...
And then at the same time...
you have other people coming
and saying...
"Now, look, the funeral's done.
"Come and do interviews.
Come and do... "
And, uh, it's not nice...
because it's a very aggressive
environment.
Three months
after the funeral...
the name "Chaplin"
was again in the headlines.
The macabre, tragic story
had 2 main actors:
a Pole and a Bulgarian...
who dug up
Charles Chaplin's coffin...
and demanded $600,000
from the family for its return.
Playing for time...
Chaplin's daughter Geraldine
conducted the negotiations.
Finally, the police moved in
and arrested the pathetic pair.
That was a nightmare.
That was the worst nightmare.
I mean, I don't really
want to even remember.
It was a horrible thing to do.
The body snatchers were judged
and sentenced.
They had reburied the coffin
in a corn field.
Today, the place of Charles
Chaplin's second burial...
is marked by a cross
and a memorial stone.
At the beginning of the fifties,
the Cold War was at its height.
America was in the grip of
anti-Communist hysteria...
whipped up
by Senator Joe McCarthy.
Chaplin was among those
branded as Red sympathizers.
For organizing Communist cells:
holding Communist meetings
in his home.
When ordered by the committee...
for investigation of un-American
activities...
to prove his loyalty
to the U.S.A...
Chaplin replied
with cutting sarcasm...
I'm no Communist agitator.
I'm an agitator for peace.
The F.B.I. had been watching
Chaplin for years...
and the file they had kept
on him since 1922...
now ran to 1,900 pages.
In September 1952...
Chaplin and his family boarded
the "Queen Elizabeth... "
bound for Europe.
They would never return.
We were totally unaware of
anything...
I mean,
of the political aspects.
I mean, I was less than
6 years old.
He certainly cast
a light also...
on certain anomalies
of American existence.
In Europe, Chaplin's
latest film, "Limelight... "
received a wildly enthusiastic
reception.
But his smiling face in public
belied his problems.
A return to America became more
and more doubtful.
On the second of December,
1952...
he left London by air
for Switzerland.
Among the passengers arriving at
Geneva airport from London...
were a very distinguished-
looking gentleman...
and his young wife.
The lady was the daughter...
of the celebrated dramatist
Eugene O'Neill:
her husband
a certain Mr. Chaplin...
none other than the one and only
Charlie Chaplin.
Oh, thank you so much.
I don't think so...
not at this time.
They've come for a holiday
in the mountains...
and are staying till Christmas.
Oh, uh, Christmas.
Soon they set off by car
for Lausanne.
This was not Chaplin's
first visit to Switzerland.
Between December 1931
and the following March...
he had spent the winter season
at the Palace Hotel, St. Moritz.
He was invited to St. Moritz...
by his closest friend from
Hollywood, Douglas Fairbanks.
His half-brother Sydney...
who helped in laying
the foundations...
for Chaplin's commercial
success...
also came to the mountains.
Here, he poses with a Citroën
car manufacturer and his family.
The former receptionist
of the Palace Hotel...
has vivid memories
of his guests.
They weren't much good on skis.
Charlie Chaplin liked the breaks
better than the action.
He didn't seem as funny
as I thought he'd be...
but he was always friendly...
and gave the impression
of sincere cordiality.
Now and again,
he'd play a trick.
Once he swore
that his great-grandfather...
was named Capelli
and came from Oberkuln.
Sometimes he didn't feel like
partying...
and he'd fade into
the background.
But when he was in the mood,
anything could happen.
Once, in front of everybody,
he collapsed and lay motionless.
We all thought he was dead.
The doctor was called...
and Charlie suddenly
came back to life.
He had fooled us all.
Chaplin liked the discretion
and seclusion he found...
in calm and conventional
Switzerland.
As early as 1932...
he had told a German journalist
that he was weary of America.
I can't imagine living the rest
of my life...
in the California sunshine.
This was the time
when the Little Tramp...
sometimes felt homesick
for Europe.
After landing in Geneva...
the Chaplins drove off
to Lausanne the same day.
Only a handful of press
reporters and onlookers...
saw them arrive.
When I got to
the Beau Rivage Hotel...
the luggage
was just being unloaded.
I had a notebook with me...
and when I spotted Chaplin,
I handed it to him...
and he wrote his autograph
and a little message...
and then I left.
Yves Debraine,
a press photographer...
approached Chaplin and Oona
outside the hotel...
and recommended
a smart restaurant.
They appreciated
his friendliness...
and eventually he became the
family's regular photographer.
Fifty years later...
Chaplin's son Michael meets
Debraine in the same restaurant.
My parents were searching
for a house...
not... not having planned
to have to live in Europe.
Following Chaplin's exile
from America...
Oona urged him to seek
a lasting solution.
In the interim...
the family continued living
in the hotel for several months.
The Beau Rivage... I remember it
as something... as rather sad.
My mother used to sit
at the window and look...
and there was nothing.
It was just gray.
The first day that, finally,
the other side of the lake...
we saw those beautiful
mountains...
my mother was,
"Oh, but it's pretty here".
Chaplin looked around Gstaad...
but found the surrounding
mountains oppressive.
Above Vevey, and overlooking
the lake of Geneva...
he found a 15-room house
that seemed ideal...
the Manoir de Ban.
For him and his wife...
and their children
Geraldine, Michael...
Josephine, and Victoria...
this house became
their microcosm.
From it,
he looked out on the world...
and the world came
to his doorstep.
I don't actually remember them...
a moment when they told me
we wouldn't go back...
but my mother tells me that
I was constantly asking her...
"When are we gonna go back
to America?"
And, of course, this was quite
disturbing for her...
because she knew that
we wouldn't go back.
The children lived
on the top floor.
My mother and father lived on
the first floor.
My mother and father would have
breakfast together...
in this room or on the terrace
if it was a nice day...
and then my father
would start working.
My mother had all kinds of
different jobs.
You know, she'd pay the bills...
but as well, she did the menu
for the day.
At lunchtime,
they would eat together...
and my father would work again.
6:30, he always had an apéritif
with my mother...
and then at quarter to 7:00,
we would all eat together.
If I think of it now, it was
at times a lot of happiness...
a lot of gaiety, a lot of...
And then when my mother was
alone after my father's death...
it was a terrible place...
spooky, haunted, awful.
The traumatic flight
left painful traces.
Chaplin broke off all contacts
with the U.S.A...
and the local population
was delighted...
that the famous man
would be living among them.
I received a phone call...
asking whether Mr. Chaplin
could come...
to have his passport photos
taken.
Naturally,
it was quite an event...
to have Chaplin himself
here in my studio.
I'd decided to settle
in Switzerland...
and now we'd begun
to divest ourselves...
of every tie
in the United States.
Oona decided to give up
her American citizenship.
To our amazement...
we discovered that
the Manoir de Ban has 37 acres.
In front of the terrace...
is a 5-acre lawn
with magnificent tall trees...
and an orchard to which,
in season...
no matter where we are,
we make a special pilgrimage.
Only a short while after moving
into the Manoir de Ban...
the Chaplins discovered
an unexpected nuisance.
Chaplin came to look around
the property...
with the idea of buying it.
It was winter, and there was
no shooting going on.
But one day after he moved in...
he realized that the rifle range
was very close to his house.
At that time,
the army also used the range...
sometimes from 7:00
in the morning...
and Chaplin was very,
very angry.
Chaplin complained
about the noise...
from the rifle range nearby.
The headlines were merciless.
A year-long legal fight began...
and the legendary defensive
readiness of the Swiss...
came out best.
Chaplin had to agree to
a compromise.
Later, in his film
"A King in New York... "
the noise of firing
was the subject of a gag.
This row?
Isn't this rather close?
It's the best we could get, sir.
Stick 'em up! This is it!
Let's go.
It went against everything that
he thought of Switzerland...
his idea of Switzerland being
in peace and quiet.
He even talked about leaving
at one point...
selling and moving on
somewhere else.
But really, he was...
he really loved being here.
He loved this house.
Chaplin explores
his new surroundings.
With his half-brother Sydney
behind the camera...
he watches the wine harvest
festival in Vevey.
After having lunch
and sampling the atmosphere...
Charles Chaplin was introduced
to the ex-queen of Italy.
Later, the famous actor...
who was apparently
a left-hander...
signed the visitors book.
You don't have to decipher the
signature to know who wrote it.
Madame Oona Chaplin was also
among the guests of royalty.
Charles Chaplin was 63
when he moved to Switzerland.
Despite all his efforts...
learning French
turned out to be difficult.
He desperately wanted to learn
French, and he really tried.
For the first time
in his life...
he found something
that he could not do...
because he could do everything.
And he'd wake up
at 5:00 in the morning.
He had his Berlitz records
and books...
and he'd get up, and he'd go...
He could never do it.
We love Vevey.
We like the people.
They are charming, hospitable,
and genuine.
And I think...
that is one important thing
in the world today...
that people are genuine
and kindly.
Uh, you have a lot of talent
in Vevey...
and perhaps sometime I may see
fit to put them in a picture.
Thank you, Mr. Chaplin.
He had no plans to stop working.
As soon as
he had settled down...
Chaplin started writing
the film script...
"A King in New York... "
based on his negative
experiences in America.
I could have gone to London...
to watch them shooting
"A King in New York".
Madame Chaplin had managed to
get permission...
for me to get away
from school...
but my father refused
to let me go...
because he said
he didn't know these people.
"A King in New York"
premiered in London.
This film was shown in America
only 19 years later.
Michael acted with his father.
When I'd gone to see
"The Great Dictator... "
I did an imitation of him
imitating Hitler.
And he thought
that was quite funny...
and I think that he...
gave him the idea of putting me
in the part.
- How do you do, Rupert?
- How do you do?
Sit down.
And what's that you're reading?
Karl Marx.
Surely you're not a Communist.
Do I have to be a Communist
to read Karl Marx?
Rupert!
That's a valid answer.
Well, if you're not a Communist,
what are you?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
I dislike all forms
of government.
But somebody must rule.
And I don't like
the word "rule".
Well, if we don't like
the word "rule... "
let's call it leadership.
Leadership in government
is political power...
and political power's
an official form...
of antagonizing the people.
What magazine
did you say he edits?
For once, I really had a...
a memorable moment of
communication with him...
which I don't think I...
It was more intense than
anything I had with him...
before or after.
In his self-chosen Swiss exile
in 1953...
Chaplin met the Romanian-born
pianist Clara Haskil...
and a firm friendship developed.
After a concert
with a Hungarian quartet...
my parents organized
a reception...
and Charles Chaplin
turned up alone.
It was his first meeting
with Clara Haskil...
and subsequently...
we were regularly invited to
the Chaplin home at Christmas.
And she sat at the piano
and played.
When she'd finished...
I went up to her in my naive way
and I said...
"But you... you are
a very great artist".
And she smiled.
Clara Haskil would come
every Christmas for dinner...
with the Rossiers...
and we would have a wonderful
American dinner.
And after dinner,
Clara would play the piano...
and we would all be...
my father would weep.
And then he would show a movie,
and Clara would laugh and weep.
And they just...
they adored each other.
In 1960,
at Brussels train station...
Clara Haskil tripped
on a stairway...
and sustained
severe head injuries.
A few hours later, she died.
In my lifetime...
I have met 3 geniuses:
Professor Einstein,
Winston Churchill...
and Clara Haskil.
I'm not a trained musician...
but I can only say that
her touch was exquisite...
her expression wonderful...
and her technique extraordinary.
Four other children were born
in Switzerland:
Eugene, Jane, Annette...
and finally, in 1962,
Christopher.
With his fourth wife,
Oona O'Neill...
Chaplin had found happiness.
My mother, uh, was the backbone
for my father, you know.
He depended on her a lot.
She spent more time with us
than my father.
She really wanted to know
how our life was.
They looked to me
like a perfect couple.
He lived for her
and she for him.
If he looked at a flower...
she would ask why he did so
without consulting her.
She obviously wanted to leave
the impression...
that she was a good wife...
which is always
very praiseworthy...
because you don't get
that feeling very often.
They enclosed themselves...
my mother and my father...
in that Manoir de Ban.
That was their microcosm.
They lived there.
They lived this great, huge,
eternal romance there.
She was totally dependent
on him...
and that gradually turned
the other way round...
where he was totally dependent
on her.
Daddy was the president
and the minister of interior.
Mummy was the foreign relations.
My mother used to write us
letters.
Even when we were at home...
we'd get a little letter slipped
under the door saying...
"I didn't approve of
what you've done... "
or "Your father doesn't
approve... " or whatever.
But we never actually got
together for family discussions.
He was a good father,
that's for sure...
but he didn't want to be
disturbed...
by noises in the house.
He was a bit
looking at his daughters.
The girls were favorites.
Comical Uncle Sydney was always
a favorite with the family.
He was a great eccentric.
He lived in America...
in California.
He never had a house.
He was a very rich man:
never had a house.
He lived in a... in a caravan.
Uncle Sydney would come over
at least once a week...
with Aunt Gypsy...
and my father and Uncle Sydney
would speak in pig Latin.
And they would speak
in rhyming slang.
No one would understand them...
the Cockney rhyming slang.
A frequent visitor to the Manoir
de Ban was Jerry Epstein...
who produced
Chaplin's later films.
Celebrities from all over the
world traveled to meet Chaplin.
The novelist Graham Greene
was a regular visitor...
to the Chaplins' home
above Vevey.
He knew Chaplin
for many years...
and it was an on-and-off
relationship.
They would meet when my father
came over to Switzerland.
Um, I... I expect
they corresponded.
We saw a Charlie Chaplin film
at the Manoir...
and that was the one
about the dictator.
He was very proud to show
the movie.
Taking an interest in the Swiss
film industry...
he met actress
Liselotte Pulver...
the star of a Swiss
film classic.
I lost immediately the respect.
I didn't think that he was...
the greatest film director
of all time.
And, of course, I hoped that
he would give me a part...
for instance,
in one of his future films...
but he just signed my script.
He went to the government
afterwards...
and when he went away...
I had the impression
it's an old friend of mine.
The same day, Chaplin was also
invited to Bern...
where he met the federal
councilor Philipp Etter.
On a sheet of government-
letterheaded paper, he wrote...
Hope I meet you some day.
But it was not to be.
From the corridors of power...
eyes were watching him
very carefully.
Just as in America...
pages of notes and observations
were being accumulated.
Swiss police officers kept
a watch on the actor's home.
Uninvited observers were nearby
when, at the Manoir de Ban...
Chaplin received
the international peace prize...
awarded by Russia.
This photo was taken
by Yves Debraine...
who was a guest
at the presentation ceremony.
The Swiss police
was in civilian clothes...
and there were
a few people there.
The guardians of
national security were busy.
The names of all present
were carefully noted...
and Chief Inspector Campiche
sent a full report to Bern.
I heard that, and I didn't want
to read about it...
because I love Switzerland...
and I just think
it's so disgusting.
The Swiss federal police
are finally observed...
about 900,000 people.
In this context...
you find also the observation
of Charlie Chaplin.
I think that his private life...
didn't really been spied out
very well...
but only his contacts...
to cultural personalities
of the Eastern bloc.
Switzerland's own Knie Circus
comes to Lausanne.
This evening,
there's a famous performer:
Charlie Chaplin himself.
Or so it seems.
The real Charlie Chaplin is in
the audience with his wife Oona.
The fake Charlie Chaplin
bows low.
The real Chaplin
congratulates him.
He always came with
the first trailers...
and the first animals
who came to the place.
He was also there.
He looked at the circus...
how we put it up...
and he asked us was it new.
"What did you change?"
Chaplin's eldest son Michael...
gets a ride on a donkey
given to him by the circus.
His famous father
is asked to say a few words.
Tonight, we've seen Chaplin
again in the big top.
My father loved the circus...
because I think it's the nearest
form of art to the music hall.
He loved circus.
There was 4 or 5 days
he stayed around the circus.
He was backstage
and the afternoons.
I remember when I was
a little child...
he invited all the childrens
from the circus...
to have tea and cakes
at his home.
And then in this moment...
he always showed us some little
tricks from the movies.
Chaplin's silent film
"The Circus... "
won him an Oscar in 1929.
It was only in the sixties...
that Chaplin wrote the music
for this film.
I say this
without any false modesty.
I think it has a certain charm,
you know?
A certain charm.
And you have. You have.
During his life, Charles Chaplin
composed about 500 melodies:
more than 200 of them
during his years in Switzerland.
Charlie's...
was in a unique position...
to be able to hear the music
in his head very clearly...
and the orchestration also
in his head.
Possibly the most significant
influence...
that Chaplin exercised
on film music...
was to focus it on song.
He never learned music.
He couldn't read music
or write music...
but he would compose
on the piano...
with a tape recorder going.
He would have an arranger
next to him...
which was Eric James
at the time...
and he would write down
all the music notes.
On 1...
and they're about
halfway through.
When he was writing his
autobiography, for instance...
he'd come in and sit.
"Look, Oona. Read this".
And she'd read it and she'd say,
"Well, I don't like this".
"What?!" And he would get
furious and...
but really like a beast...
and get in a terrible state
and change it.
After that, I have a notion
to make a very large comedy...
what one would call
an extravaganza:
an extravaganza.
Um, and it's merely
a notion now.
It's... I have several ideas...
but the thing hasn't...
hasn't any form at present.
Ysobel Deluz
was one of the first...
to work closely with
Charles Chaplin in Switzerland.
She was his secretary.
Sometimes it was like
a crazy film.
He'd say, "Leave that out... "
and a little later,
"Did you get that?
"Did you note what I said?"
I'd say, "No.
You told me not to".
He would fly into a rage
and shout...
"How can I work if you don't put
everything down?"
Chaplin's outbursts of temper
could be terrifying.
Ysobel Deluz had a nervous
breakdown and was dismissed.
She took Chaplin to court
and won.
He had a natural authority.
You had to be extremely
careful...
and above all,
avoid treading on his feet.
He had a couple of people
who left...
and who sued him afterwards:
a couple of ugly, ugly episodes.
However, most people
liked to work for Chaplin.
Gabriele Di Rito was
his hairdresser for 12 years.
We communicated eye to eye.
He seemed to trust me
to do a good job...
and I was happy to work for
such a celebrity.
I asked 70 francs for cutting
Charlie Chaplin's hair.
Madame Chaplin paid me
beforehand...
and then left for shopping.
At the end...
Monsieur Chaplin slipped a
100-franc note into my pocket...
and tapped me on the shoulder.
Very, very nice.
Very, very nice.
Charles Chaplin chose
his 70th birthday...
to express, yet again,
his political opinions.
I feel I am privileged
to express a hope.
The hope is this... that we shall
have peace throughout the world:
that we shall abolish wars...
and settle all international
differences...
at the conference table:
that we shall abolish all atom
and hydrogen bombs...
before they abolish us.
The future of the modern world
demands modern thinking.
My father had a great talent
which not a lot of people have.
He started from nothing
and made a lot of money.
But the second thing is,
and the hardest thing...
is to enjoy the money
they've made.
He'd go traveling.
He'd go to Italy.
He loved going down to Italy.
Mr. Chaplin rented the chalet
from 1962 to 1965.
When he engaged me,
I asked him...
"Have you already done
some skiing?"
And he said, "Oh, yes.
"I was in St. Moritz
when I was younger...
"and I learned to ski there".
So he said, "Good.
"I'll go in front, and you just
follow in my tracks".
He was really very serious:
scared of falling.
Not a bit like Charlie Chaplin
in the films.
He found that it was a lot
harder than he'd expected...
and he had a few dramatic falls,
but it was quite funny.
I think he just wanted to show
Michael that he knew how to ski.
That was his real aim.
In 1966, shooting began
on his last film...
"A Countess from Hong Kong".
He was working with
a whole new team of people...
and he was held
by a time schedule...
which he never had
that problem before.
He would play every part...
and he'd always play it better
than anyone.
And with Sophia Loren...
he would be more Sophia Loren
than Sophia Loren.
He'd do the part,
and he was Sophia Loren.
Did I startle you?
Nothing was done in 3 takes.
It was done again and again
and again and again.
It took a lot of...
of energy out of him
to make this film.
His own 9-second appearance was
explained at a press conference.
Well, in the first place,
I'm getting on.
I'm 77 years old.
And I believe that with
a certain amount of age...
is something to do with
the aesthetics.
Excuse me. Do you mind closing
all your portholes, sir?
Yes. It seems to be blowing up
out there.
Oh, just a little sloppy...
nothing serious.
Yeah.
I've been wondering about
the immortality of the soul.
It wasn't really much of a part.
I had to just dance with
Marlon Brando, which was...
"Thank you, Daddy".
At the premiere in London,
no one knew what to expect.
At nearly 80, was yet another
masterpiece possible?
The entire world's press
was present...
to see Chaplin's first
color film.
Take off those pajamas.
Would that look nice?
You heard what I said.
Take 'em off.
Oh, please. My nerves.
- Take them off.
- Oh, this is silly.
We'll see how silly this is.
Take 'em off.
Oh, please. Do you want me
to call the captain?
What a disaster.
Really, what are we doing?
You'll get off this boat if I...
Who is it?
The British critics
judged it a flop.
"A disappointing film from
Chaplin," went the headlines.
They were disgusting.
They really were.
The critics were disgusting.
It's so easy, also.
He was extraordinarily upset.
I think deep down he knew...
it wasn't exactly
as he wanted it.
Yet even here,
Chaplin reaped a success.
His composition
"This Is My Song... "
the film's theme tune...
became a worldwide hit
overnight.
When I was in Charlie's
living room...
he was prancing around the room
singing...
and me banging away
on the piano...
which was a very strange scene.
Um, but it was fun.
And I said to him, you know...
"OK, this is 3 big hits
you've got.
"Do you have anything else?"
And he said, "Yes, yes, yes.
I have many songs".
And he took them
out of some cupboard...
and played some of them to me.
And they were good.
And I've often wondered
what happened to those songs.
And love, this is my song
Here is a song, a serenade
To you
The 8 Chaplin children
were gradually growing up.
One by one,
they left the Manoir de Ban...
and sometimes the partings
from the family home...
left indelible traces.
I don't know if I left.
I think I was kicked out,
actually.
Well, I say I left.
And Michael certainly left.
When I was 16, I left home.
I ran away.
I just couldn't live up to
what he expected of me...
and I left without saying
where I was going.
And I think it kind of hurt
my mother a lot...
and he had a hard time
forgiving me for that.
In the sixties
and the seventies...
Charles Chaplin received
numerous honors.
Oxford University awarded him
an honorary doctorate.
Holland honored him in 1965.
He said, "Unfortunately,
I've won this prize...
"this Erasmus prize...
"and I have to unfortunately
share it... the prize...
"with another person.
"I don't know who that is...
"but I think his name
is something like, uh, um...
"Berger.
"Um, something Berger.
"Uh, Ing-Ingman... Ingman Berger".
I said, "No, Ingmar Bergman".
"Oh. Who's that?
He's Norwegian, I'm told".
"No, no, he's Swedish".
"Oh, he's Swedish. Oh, yes".
Chaplin and Peter Ustinov
were born on the 16th of April.
Ustinov well remembers...
the laudatory speech
he made in Amsterdam.
I was called onto the stage...
in order to do my soliloquy
in praise of Chaplin...
and the applause was not one...
which would encourage anybody
to go on speaking.
I finished, and suddenly...
Tremendous applause,
and I looked around.
I said to myself...
"It's impossible that they've
all understood the jokes now".
No, it wasn't that.
It was Chaplin was on his way
to the podium...
to push me aside
and make his speech.
And like a well-trained comic...
he had used me, really...
as somebody to warm
the public up.
Chaplin was made an honorary
citizen of Milan, Italy...
but despite several
applications...
he was never granted honorary
citizenship in Switzerland.
In London, his birthplace...
he was knighted by
Queen Elizabeth ll.
We boarded the same flight...
American Airlines...
from New York to Los Angeles.
He was very happy
to see old friends.
He was anticipating a return to
where he has been so often...
and he was not nervous...
but he was happily
looking forward.
The honorary Oscar awarded for
lifetime achievement...
was a late reconciliation...
with the land
that had humiliated him...
yet helped him to achieve fame.
Oh, you're wonderful,
sweet people.
Thank you.
At that time, a standing ovation
was something exceptional...
and the one for Charlie
was more exceptional...
because of the incredible warmth
everybody gave him.
Up there are clouds in the sky
Oona told me
what's happened there onstage.
He was so touched.
He took the hand from Oona
and asked her...
"You think they forgive me...
the Americans?"
My sister Josephine and I...
I remember we were very,
very much against him...
going back to the United States.
We tried everything we could...
to make him not go back to
the States, and he went.
And we were so wrong,
because it was for him.
It gave him
a new lease on life...
when he did go back
to the States.
They gave him a visa
of only 10 days...
and we thought,
"Oh, this is disgusting.
"Oh, Daddy, how dare they?"
and everything.
He was thrilled.
He said, "They're still
scared of me".
The closest moments
I ever had with him...
were when I was grown up:
uh, when I was...
when I was back after I'd
started my own career...
towards the end of his life.
Sometimes he'd say,
"I love you... "
and that would just destroy me.
Just the "I love you".
He didn't say it often,
but when he did, it was...
He had one side of him...
which was certainly someone
who enjoyed life...
but he had another side...
which was someone
who could get very angry...
and seemed sometimes
quite unreasonable.
He was introverted, because he
never express himself freely.
He was always on the...
kind of reserve...
or kind of self-control.
He was tres anglais:
very British.
He was very, very self-absorbed.
He loved the fire.
He would sit in front of
the fire winter and summer.
And at the end of his days...
my mother used to try
and get him up and get him out:
say, "Come on.
You must get out".
And he'd say,
"It's my only luxury".
During the seventies...
a silence crept over
the Manoir de Ban.
Chaplin was now over 80...
and the man whose youthful charm
had seemed indestructible...
was gradually losing
his vitality.
Doggedly, however,
he continued working.
More melodies emerged...
and the idea for a new film
refused to go away...
but his strength was fading.
Well, death comes to us
very reluctantly...
and, uh...
life is marvelous.
Right to the end...
Chaplin continued working on
a last film... "The Freak".
The manuscript
is now in the care...
of the Chaplin archives
in Montreux.
Despite his advanced age...
Chaplin continued to believe...
that he would one day direct
"The Freak".
We're going to make a picture
called, uh, "The Freak".
That's an angel
with wink... wings.
My sister Vicki left home...
and he'd written this film
for her...
and she really broke his heart
with that.
This was the run-up to the first
shooting sessions.
Chaplin was reliving the years
of long ago...
feeling again the creativeness
and happiness of those times.
Sadly, the film
was never made...
because he was already very old
and easily tired.
In 1977, in Vevey,
for the last time...
Charles Chaplin watched
Rolf Knie as a clown.
When Charlie came the last time
to the circus...
and I crossed the ring...
and from far away
he made like that to me...
and that means it's, uh...
it heated my heart.
During the last weeks
of his life...
he watched quite a lot of TV.
And it was amazing...
'cause you thought
his mind was elsewhere.
A lot was going on
in his head...
but he couldn't
communicate it, so...
Chaplin's last appearance
on film was at home...
during the wine harvest
festival.
These silent pictures are shown
here for the first time.
Charlie Chaplin
back where he began.
No words are needed to remember
this great artist.
This is for you, Charlie.
Why is my heart so light?
Why are the stars so bright?
Why is the sky so blue
Since the hour I met you?
Flowers are smiling bright
Smiling for our delight
Smiling so tenderly
For the world, you and me
Love, this is my song
Hello, Dad.
Uh, I know you're up there
somewhere...
and I hope it's good up there.
Miss you and love you.
World cannot be wrong
If in this world
There is you
I care not
what the world may say
Without your love
there is no day
Be well, wherever you are...
and probably see you soon,
if I'm lucky.
This is my song
Bye-bye, Charlie. Thanks for
your magnificent career.
You too, Charlie.
I'll remember your bowler
and your cane...
and your little mustache.
Daddy, don't come back.
Stay where you are, please.
This is not a nice world.
You, who were such
an optimist...
and who really thought that
things would work out...
don't come back now, but leave
the Little Tramp here.
This is my song
