The Scarlet Letter
North America in the second half
of the 1 7th century.
For nigh on a generation
European immigrants have settled.. .
along the Atlantic coast.
Unexplored wilderness separates the
Dutch, French and English settlers.
The continent still belongs
to the lndians.
ls this place called Salem?
Whose house is that?
That house on the island?
- You can't go there.
- Why?
lt is forbidden.
And Salem?
They're fetching the whore now!
Come.
What's going on?
Court is in session.
Bad day for some people.
l'd like some tea.
- Where are you from?
- Apples.
Where are you from?
For shaving?
l guess you haven't eaten apples
for some time.
My tea.
The court will wait no longer!
The way she wears that letter. . .
pride goes before a fall.
- What?
- Yeah.
Your tea is on the stove.
Here they come!
The whore!
- That whore!
- She has brought shame on us all.
- She should be burned.
- She has brought shame on us all.
Hester Prynne, in the name of the
Church of New England l remind you. . .
Hester Prynne!
Hester Prynne!
Hester Prynne!
Hester Prynne!
What are you doing here?
They can all see you.
Why don't you tear that sign
from your breast?
You should flee to the wilds with me,
where no one can find you.
lt's better there than here.
Hester Prynne, in the name of the
Church of New England l remind you:
seven years ago you were
found guilty of adultery. . .
and sentenced by this court
to wear the sign. . .
Think about it, Hester Prynne!
. . .of shame upon your breast
for the rest of your life. . .
and live apart from us. . .
until you reveal the name
of your partner in sin.
You were spared a sentence of death. . .
because your husband is
presumed dead.
His ship never reached New England.
Therefore your punishment was mild:
to bear your whole life long. . .
the sign of adultery...
Hester Prynne. . .
if you reveal the name,
we shall show clemency.
Make up your mind.
Don't test our patience.
The court is no longer willing
to wait upon your reply.
Hester Prynne.
Hester Prynne, your soul must
finally find rest and peace.
Tell us the name of the man
you sinned with.
Do not be silent
out of pity or love for him.
Confess and give your child a father.
Your silence does not help him.
Perhaps he is amongst us,
watching this spectacle.
God knows,
he should be standing there.
But he will be found.
Throw him, who had not
the courage to confess. . .
upon the court's mercy.
My child shall seek her father in heaven.
- Where to?
- To my house.
Be careful, so he won't fall.
- lt's the adulteress's fault.
- He took it too much to heart.
- Where?
- On the chair.
Make two measures of tea with this.
Can you help?
He needs rest.
Why don't we offer to let her come here
and feel at home?
Perhaps she will then name the father.
We were too generous.
On the contrary.
Every year we let her parade
her spectacle of pride. . .
and contempt before the parish.
That does not help the community.
She alone profits from it.
lt's worth considering.
She does not feel the shame so sorely
outside the community.
Here, all would see her.
We should allow her to move freely.
lt would be only just to send her
to meet her Maker. . .
for her stubbornness.
He will help us, too,
to arrive at a just decision.
We shall carefully weigh
the pros and cons.
l, myself, shall try to. . .
Who is the stranger with the minister?
A doctor. Come.
Do not wake the child.
lt is forbidden to come here.
l should have known
when l came to your settlement. . .
that l would find you like this.
l was much older than you.
How could l believe that
intellectual faculties could. . .
replace youth.
l was always frank with you.
l did not feel any love. . .
and did not pretend to.
lt was my stupidity.
You said you'd come later.
l came.
We were ship-wrecked.
l lived among the lndians.
You're a stranger to me.
There need be no
reproach between us.
The father?
ls he alive?
Who is it?
You may conceal your secret
before the minister and the crowd.
But l shall sense it, Hester,
when he is near.
l shall find him one day.
l shall stay here.
No one knows me here.
Never tell anyone l was your husband.
Swear it!
Go!
l'm so relieved that
we finally have a doctor here.
Does that woman on the island
have her child there?
How can they both live there?
She is looked after.
And what shall become of the child?
lt will be like a wild animal.
Does it resemble
anyone in the village?
l have never seen it.
You should let the mother
and child return to the village.
She is so obstinate.
Why won't she reveal the father's name?
l am the father.
Here comes Red Poison Mushroom!
Here comes Red Poison Mushroom!
One two three four five six seven
Where has gone that man?
l'll wait here.
My dear Master Fuller,
get used to the idea.
lt is decided.
l have pardoned Hester Prynne.
She may stay freely here in Salem.
We shall see how she behaves herself.
l really wonder whether women should
be allowed to sing psalms in church.
ln the first place, women are forbidden
to speak in church. . .
Corinthians, chapter 1 4, verse 34.
Simply because a woman is not
allowed to in a man's presence.
Woman is subservient to Man.
And secondly, much less. . .
Much less are they allowed to
make prophecies in church.
Timothy, chapter 2, verses 1 1 and 1 2.
Psalms are a sort of prophecy.
Women are also much more
liable to err.
Verse 1 4.
Thus they can easily
seduce one into error.
l'd like some cloth.
The dark blue. . .
And that linen back there. . .
When the Apostle says 'speak'. . .
he especially means analyzing
and interpreting the Scriptures.
He does not mean that
women shouldn't sing in church.
''Blessed is the man that
hath a virtuous wife. . .
for the number of his days
shall be double.''
Ecclesiasticus, chapter 24.
l can't pay for it.
So. . .
l haven't any money.
Will you chalk it up?
l'm supposed to sew for
Governor Bellingham.
All right. But l won't have you
sewing my coat.
l'm sure our Minister Dimmesdale will
preach a sermon on election day. . .
that will make all New England sit up.
l hope l shall prove
worthy of this honor.
Let us hope our doctor will
nurse you back to strength.
He takes a lot of trouble with me.
You understand that l shall prescribe
exercise for Mr. Dimmesdale.
Stop it! lt hurts.
- Liar!
- Nobody believes you!
Lies have short legs
Lies have short legs
Lies have short legs
Red Poison Mushroom! Run!
Eww!
ln my eight years with the lndians. . .
l learned more about nature
and her laws. . .
than l could ever have got from books.
We often scorn the lndians
as savages and barbarians. . .
and abhor their medicine as witchcraft.
Actually, they know more than we do.
They may know Nature better,
but they are heathens.
l'm a heathen, too.
Savages are often
more humane than we are.
Do not let my doubts frighten you.
l had no one to confide my innermost
thoughts to for ages.
You are firm of faith.
You will help me.
Who are you, Child?
l am your little Pearl.
Are you really my child?
Of course, l am your little Pearl.
No, you are not my little Pearl.
Tell me who you are and
what sent you into this world.
You tell me. Mother.
The Heavenly Father sent you.
He didn't send me.
l haven't got a Heavenly Father.
Quiet. You mustn't speak that way.
He sends us all.
Where else would you come from?
You tell me
You tell me
Did anyone see you come?
l thought it was now allowed. . .
Come in.
Red, red, red are your clothes
Red, red, red are your shoes
'Cause the devil was your tailor
And you're a red poison mushroom
Pointed nose, pointed chin
Shows the place the witch is in
Red, red, red are your clothes
Red, red, red are your shoes
'Cause the devil was your tailor
And you're a red poison mushroom
Pointed nose.. .
ls Governor Bellingham home?
Yes, the Governor is home.
l'd like to see him.
l mustn't let anyone in.
The Governor is with the clergyman. . .
a visitor.
l can't let anyone in.
The child is already in the house.
At least let me get the child
out of the house.
Nevertheless, l want to enter.
Pearl!
lf these lndian troubles spread,
we shall have to arm.
We might even have to. . .
What a strange-looking child!
l have never seen the like
since my youth.
At that time the King's court swarmed
with such little sprites during festivities.
Children of merriment.
Tell me, child. . .
where is your mother?
Why has she dressed you up like that?
Are you a Christian child?
l am my mother's child, Pearl.
You should be called Ruby.
Do you know your catechism?
Or are you one of those
ne'er-do-wells. . .
we left behind in England?
Where is your mother?
Now l understand.
This is the child we were talking of.
The daughter of the whore.
Hester Prynne.
We have spoken about you a lot.
We were wondering if it's right. . .
to entrust the soul of this child. . .
to a fallen woman.
Wouldn't it be better for the child
if it came into other hands. . .
dressed more simply,
and above all. . .
strictly brought up?
ls she instructed in the
heavenly and earthly truths?
l can teach my child
what l learned myself.
Because your character is tainted. . .
we wish to place the child elsewhere.
Let us judge cautiously
and consider well. . .
What is to be done.
Pastor Wilson, please examine
this child Pearl.
Let us see if she has received
any Christian education.
Now, little Pearl. . .
can you tell me who made you?
The Heavenly Father sent me.
l wasn't made. Mother picked me
from the apple tree.
A seven year old child.
Further questions are unnecessary.
God gave me this child.
You can't take her away from me.
We shall look after the child
better than you.
God gave her to me.
l won't give her up.
You speak for me.
You know me better
than these gentleman. Help me.
You were my pastor.
l do not want to lose her.
God gave her the child
and a mother's instinct.
No one else knows. . .
the strange character and
needs of this child.
The child was given to her by God
as a blessing. . .
and as pain and punishment.
And the ever-recurring
sting of fear of death.
She's made a clown of the child.
Hasn't she expressed it
in the child's clothing. . .
which so clearly reminds us
of the red flaming sign on her breast?
This child is destined to keep
the mother's soul alive. . .
and protect her from darker sins.
And at every moment she will remind
the mother of her own greatest sin.
Let us leave the two together,
as God has ordained.
Let us drop the matter.
A strange child.
She doesn't even need
a broom to fly off.
l'd never have left her
with the mother.
One might divine the father
from the child's ways.
Hester Prynne!
Come tonight.
We're meeting in the forest.
l promised my sisters to bring the
lovely Hester. They're waiting.
There's a full moon tonight.
And bring your child, too.
Do not leave me alone,
Hester Prynne.
Hester Prynne!
Let me go.
l suspect what is making him ill.
l need to observe
and examine him more.
Yes, do that. Help him.
You are the only one that can.
We would all be grateful.
You might move into his house,
into an attic above his room.
You'd be there night and day
to help him.
Stop!
You can't pass.
lt's the only path.
Then stay on the island, you whore.
Your sign burnt out his eyes.
- Burn her.
- The witch.
- She should be burned.
- The witch.
- Burn the witch.
- She should be burned.
The parish is worried about your health,
Master Dimmesdale.
l need no doctor.
lf it were God's will, l would be happy. . .
if my pain and duties ended soon,
with my life.
When you're young,
you give up life so easily.
Take a wife.
l don't want to.
Let's take on a housekeeper.
l don't need anyone.
You shouldn't go to so much
trouble over me.
Why do you move in with me?
lf you're to be the community doctor
you should be here for others, too.
Besides, l don't feel sick.
- Go away.
- Don't hit me.
Come over here!
l can't live with you any longer.
Go back to bed.
l'll look after her.
Stay with her.
Don't leave her alone for a moment.
Why won't you let her go?
l can't remember.
Then start again from the beginning.
Jonah fell overboard during a storm.
He almost drowned.
And then a big fish came
and swallowed him.
And in the belly. . .
of that whale,
Jonah lived for three whole weeks.
He sat in the dark.
But l forget how he got out.
How did he get out of the dark belly?
Out of the belly, without blood. . .
through the thick cloths
l am not allowed to wash.
Go outside.
The blood is running down my legs.
The whale spewed Jonah
onto the beach. . .
l believe.
The Governor. . .
the Governor said. . .
Why are you sitting in the rain?
Mr. Chillingworth, did you
send for Hester Prynne?
Send her in.
Hester Prynne.
l hear you can tend the sick.
l have to bleed Governor Bellingham.
Minister!
Find the doctor!
Now run, child.
Why don't you help him?
The minister fell in the street.
He fell on his face.
Why?
Be careful.
How dirty he has become.
He needs a wife.
Where to?
To the pastor's house.
Your child is climbing the cliffs
on the shore.
Hurry up!
You shouldn't leave her alone like that.
l've been observing you for days.
But l still cannot perceive
the root of your sickness.
Are you concealing something?
You haven't told me everything.
l cannot tell you more.
lllnesses are often signs of spiritual. . .
or mental suffering.
Then l don't need your help in any case.
Or do you know a cure for the soul?
The soul.
l can only cure you if you wish it
and conceal nothing.
lf my soul were sick. . .
l would only confide in a doctor of souls.
Red, red, red are my clothes
Red, red, red are my shoes
And the Devil is my tailor
And the witch, that is--
Where is your mother?
She is dead.
This is her grave.
You shouldn't lie.
lf you lie, a hand grows out of the grave.
l doubt if it was right to leave this
wild child with her mother.
ls she capable of affection?
Has she any traits from which one. . .
You're shivering. l'll light the fire.
l'd like you to undress
so as to examine you.
No. l can't do that and l won't do that.
You misunderstood me.
- l meant just your shirt.
- No! l will not!
l won't take my shirt off, either.
The child watched us.
My father is dead
l'm looking forward to tomorrow
My father is dead
l'm looking forward to tomorrow
Pearl!
Pearl!
Pearl!

ln the Alley Number Seven. . .
the house is shaking,
the mouse is shrieking. . .
and you're out!
l don't want to be!
Count to fifteen.
One, two, three. . .
four, five, six. . .
seven, eight, nine. . .
ten, eleven, twelve. . .
thirteen. . .
Won't you say where you were?
The hare must be shot for sure,
the blind man must be led for sure. . .
the path must be trod for sure. . .
the soldier must be
commanded for sure. . .
the sick man must die for sure. . .
the savage must be
converted for sure. . .
the worm must be trod on for sure. . .
the mother must be scolded for sure. . .
the water must be boiled for sure. . .
the bird must be flown for sure. . .
the lion must be roared for sure. . .
the pastor must. . .
Are you seriously going to the
chapel like that?
Dear child.
Now concerning this liberty. . .
l find there are confused ideas
among the population of New England.
There are two kinds of liberty:
a natural one,
and nature means corruption. . .
and a civil or moral one.
The first liberty is common to man,
the wild animals and other creatures.
lf we give in to this liberty. . .
and exercise it. . .
mankind descends into evil and crime.
And in the end we are worse
than the worst animals.
This liberty corrupts us all.
This liberty is the worst enemy of
truth and peace in our settlement.
lt is the ravening beast. . .
against which God's order is
established. . .
to keep us within bounds.
And with this liberty
we can do what we please.
lt is freedom for good. . .
as well as for evil.
The second kind of liberty is based on
the contract between God and Man. . .
and thus l call it moral. . .
and the contracts we have
made among ourselves.
We must answer for this liberty. . .
with all our worldly goods
and if need be, with our lives!
l heard you cry out.
What did l say?
Here's a soothing drink.
Leave me alone.
The Governor is not well.
l'll get my bag.
Hester Prynne asks you to come, too.
The Governor is dead.
Who is this doctor, Hester Prynne?
l fear him. Who is he?
l hate this person.
Can't you help me?
Let us go away.
What are you doing with these people?
They're destroying what's best in you.
The Governor is dead.
Shall we go home?
No, l want to pray for him tonight.
You don't sleep enough,
Master Dimmesdale.
Let me advise you. . .
Bellingham was too old.
He tolerated an adulteress
at his deathbed.
Governor Fuller.
Governor Fuller.
My first act in office will be
to bring this witch to trial.
And others who sully the good name
of the community.
Did you find something?
Did l tell you about Anne Hutchinson?
She is a witch.
Who says so?
The children.
They play ''Burning Anne Hutchinson''.
She was banished. But she wasn't
a witch. She was a wise woman.
Just like you?
No, not like me.
Where was she chased to?
She fled to Providence.
Where is Providence?
Three days by ship from here.
They have a different government there.
Between here and England?
Yes.
lf there were paths,
we could get there through the forest. . .
That is, if the lndians were friendlier.
Run home, l'll be right along.
l want to talk to you.
Mrs. Hester. . .
wants to speak to
old Roger Chillingworth.
My pleasure.
What can you read in my face?
l want to talk to you
about this unfortunate man.
How is he?
l once promised l would never reveal. . .
our former relationship.
But since then. . .
l could ruin him simply by
pointing my finger at him.
Revenge yourself on me.
You wear the sign.
You mentioned the minister.
l do not want to beg mercy for him.
But l must tell him
the truth now, who you are.
There is no hope for him, nor for me.
But you. . .
you have suffered wrong. . .
and you could forgive.
Where's the ship from?
lt's the Providence from Liverpool.
Hester Prynne.
l have no home anymore.
You can stay with me.
Your house is too small for four of us.
Perhaps l can leave it. . .
You can't speak anywhere without
the new Governor finding out.
We shall meet this evening.
l'd like to smash that parrot
against the wall.
What does it say?
lt swears.
Can't it swear quietly?
What does the letter mean?
A-merica.
A-ha.
When do you sail?
Tomorrow.
To England?
Maybe, but first to New Haven.
Do you take passengers?
Ask the Captain.
- Where is the Captain?
- He's still on board.
Could you ask for me?
Sure.
Could you let me know in an hour?
On the shore?
l'll make sure that
animal has gone by tomorrow.
l wanted to see the woman who
wants to travel in secret.
We are three:
two adults and a child.
All right, but we sail very early.
Could you fetch me?
On the shore of the island?
Yes.
No one must know.
But at sea you'll tell me
why you're fleeing.
Will you bring the child to the shore
tomorrow morning?
l'll tell him when he leaves chapel.
But l'm afraid.
l wonder what sort of woman she is.
That letter. . .
A!
You have plenty of time
on board to ask her.
l'm glad you're a doctor.
l'm afraid l may get sick
in the middle of the ocean.
Sea-sickness? l can't help there.
Hester.
Yes?
What has become of you?
l want to lie down here and die.
The doctor, Roger Chillingworth. . .
used to be my husband.
Can you forgive me?
No.
Have you forgotten?
What vengeance will he wreak on us?
How can l go on living?
He is my deadly enemy,
and he will not leave me alone.
Does the world stop at the town limits?
l see no way out.
Go to Europe, to the big cities.
l have no strength left.
You must.
We go together.
The ship from England will take us,
and our child.
Do you think the child
will be glad to see me?
l am shy around children.
l often feel their mistrust or aversion.
l am afraid.
l have often been disturbed
by our child. . .
because she has so many
distinct features like mine. . .
that people must realize it.
Soon you will look upon
her face without sorrow.
Don't let her notice.
She can't stand emotions when she
doesn't understand the reason.
Pearl, come.
Pearl, come or l'll fetch you.
Do you think she'll love me?
Pearl.
This is a friend.
Hester, our child knows
very well that something. . .
is not the way it should be.
Listen, you two go to the ship. . .
and l'll go back.
l must give a sermon. . .
and l want to tell them. . .
that l was the one who did it.
Hester, l must.
Go then!
Hester, listen to me!
l can't just run away.
l'll go with you afterwards.
l must preach my sermon first.
Farewell.
Let's go.
Good luck!
We'll be sailing late.
Some of our crew are missing.
Just because they can't find their parrot.
We have enough time.
l can preach and then come with you.
A fine ship and a good captain.
l hope our journey home will be
pleasant, despite the delay.
l can't find the minister anywhere.
Pastor Wilson, you'll have to
preach the sermon.
Here comes the minister.
The parrot.
Would you like a drink?
How much for the parrot?
That is priceless.
How much does she cost?
A bit of Bible lesson?
Afterwards.
To the ship, put a move on!
Get a move on, will you!
We all know we are like a city on a hill
upon which the people's eyes rest.
So that, if we do not do our work justly. . .
God will remove his
protecting hand from us. . .
and we shall be no more
than a passing wind. . .
and a hollow echo in the world.
But as long as the Lord is with us,
we are His people and His own.
And he grants us fame and honor. . .
so people will say when
they found a settlement:
Lord, let it flourish like New England.
lf we break our contract with God. . .
we open the mouths of our enemies,
who mock God's works.
We transform their prayers into
curses upon us. . .
till we are swept from this earth. . .
and our flowering garden
America returns to wilderness.
Like Jesus, we were led into the
wilderness to be tempted by Satan. . .
and to resist Satan in the name of God.
God reckons on us.
lf we do not resist Satan
in this wilderness. . .
wilderness will descend upon us. . .
and the city on the hill will be
a city accursed of God. . .
and our children. . .
and children of our children. . .
will be accursed.
l did not resist Satan.
l am the most dishonorable of you all.
l have sinned more greatly
and fallen lower than you all.
And l cannot repent.
Beneath the mask of your minister
l have deceived you all.
l was Hester Prynne's lover.
l am little Pearl's father.
l should be punished ten thousand times
more than she. . .
because l am a vile coward,
l said nothing.
Punish me with the same just severity
with which you punished her.
He's trying to take all the blame.
A miracle!
Heavenly Father.
- Let us pray.
- Kneel down.
Help me.
Let me go!
Go into the chapel and restore order.
And Hester Prynne?
Take her back to her house.
- What's the matter?
- A stone in my shoe.
A boat will wait for you on the shore.
Everything's all right now.
What's wrong with the minister?
- What's wrong?
- What's that sign on his chest?
Where's the doctor?
ls he dead?
Now l can go on board.
My father is dead
l'm looking forward to tomorrow
