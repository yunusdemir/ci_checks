<i>BRUCE:
Okay, let's see who we got here.</i>
<i>"Virge Hoogesteger."
What kind of name is that?</i>
<i>"Youngest of 6."</i>
<i>Worked in the family diner before
joining up. Writes home every week.</i>
<i>"Nicknamed 'The Virgin."'</i>
Come on, we need a little
teamwork here. Come on, fellas.
<i>BRUCE: Now, who's this goon?</i>
<i>"Jack Bocci from the
South Side of Chicago.</i>
<i>Graduate of several
reform schools."</i>
<i>Better keep him in the background.</i>
JACK: Bullshit!
<i>BRUCE: This is the religious one.
Oh, there's always a religious one.</i>
<i>"Eugene McVey from Cleveland."
There's always one from Cleveland.</i>
<i>"Nineteen, high-strung, always
coming down with something."</i>
<i>How'd he get in this bunch?</i>
(GROANING)
<i>"Richard 'Rascal' Moore.
Eighteen, 5-foot-4, 120 pounds.</i>
<i>Has a real reputation
as a ladies' man."</i>
<i>At least, that's what he says.</i>
<i>"Clay Busby, a farmer's
son." Now, look at this.</i>
<i>"When his father lost their
farm in a poker game...</i>
<i>Clay started playing piano

<i>Oh, the papers will love that.</i>
RICHARD: Come on. I'm open.

Irish if he tried. "Danny Daly.</i>
<i>'A' student, editor of the

<i>"He volunteered the day after

<i>BRUCE: That's not bad. I think we've
got something to work with here.</i>

Whoo-hoo-hoo!
CLAY: They're coming in!
(SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
EUGENE: That's 15, 16.
- VIRGE: There's another one.
- RICHARD: Hurry, you're counting today.
At this point, 15 or 16.
Sir, they're still coming in.
How can I promise you
24 planes tomorrow?
I don't even know if
they'll all make it back.
Where?
I thought we hit that
target a month ago, sir.
Yes, I know we have to
keep the pressure on...
but I lost almost a quarter
of my squadron, sir.
Yes, sir.
I will have the ground crews
work through the night.
But I was hoping to give
the boys a little break.
We're having a dance tonight in
honor of the group's first ann...
Yes, sir.
Yes, I will give you an
update when I know more.
Thank you, sir. Goodbye.
Sir, 18 planes, three still out.
(MEN CHEERING)
So that's the crew of
the <i>Memphis Belle</i>, huh?
Those are the enlisted men. You're
meeting the officers this afternoon.
(CHUCKLES)
They must be the 10 luckiest
sons of bitches in the world.
- They're just ordinary men, colonel.
- Are you kidding?
(PLANE ENGINE ROARS)
Ordinary? First they
volunteer for all this...
and then they fly 24
missions without a scratch.
- That doesn't sound very ordinary to me.
- MAN: Two more, sir.
(PLANE ENGINES ROARING)
You know, people back home are getting
pretty discouraged by our losses.
They're starting to think daylight
bombing is a big mistake.
- It's the only way we're gonna win this war.
- We gotta get that message across.
That's where I come in. The nation is
gonna fall in love with those boys.
The first crew in the Eighth Air Force
to complete their tour of duty.
- They haven't done it yet.
- They will.
You're gonna make
sure of that. Right?
One more. Just one more.
Boy, it'd be great if
everybody came back today.
- With the dance and everything.
- I give them 4-to-1.
Any takers?
- Yeah, I'll have some of that.
- Show me your money, Jack.
- Genie, loan me some money, huh?
- What do I look like, Wells Fargo?
- No, you look like a weenie...
- There it is!
(MEN APPLAUDING)
I heard they brought in a
swell band for the dance.
- Maybe they'll let you croon a tune.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
So you named the plane after
your girl back home, right?
Heh, that's a great angle.
You don't sound like you're
from the south, though.
I met her when I was in
Memphis on business.
Yeah, I bet she's a
living doll, eh, Dennis?
She's a very fine woman, sir.
Uh-huh.
Oh, a lifeguard? Wow, that's a
pretty responsible job, eh, Luke?
Well, it's rough basking in the sun all
day, having girls swarm all over you.
So I joined up. Had to get
away from all of that.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
(ALL LAUGHING)
- BRUCE: That's good.
- Yeah.
All right. "Val." And
what is that short for?
"Valentine."
(CHUCKLES)
I bet the women love that.
Now, you're the bombardier...
and, uh, I understand you have 4 years
of medical school under your belt.
Believe me, as soon as your picture
comes out in <i>LIFE</i> magazine...
every man, woman and child in America
is gonna want you to be their doctor.
Would you look at the camera, Phil?
Sit up straight.
- Smile?
- What is there to smile about, sir?
You guys have finished 24 missions.
One more and you go home.
That'd sure make me smile.
Well, you're not me.
Would you please just
take the picture?
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
- Is that all, sir?
- BRUCE: Not quite.
You'll go back home in the
<i>Belle,</i> fly all over the U.S...
making speeches, getting people
to buy more war bonds...
work longer hours,
put out more planes.
And, uh, believe me, you'll be
wined, womened and songed...
from one end of the
States to the other.
It'll be tough, but, uh, we
all have to make sacrifices.
- You mean we're gonna be famous, sir?
- I'm afraid so, Luke.
(LAUGHS)
- Colonel Derringer?
- BRUCE: Ah-ah-ah.
I'm Army PR. You can call me Bruce.
We'll follow your orders
to the best of our...
These are not orders, Dennis.
We're working together on this.
Fine. But I don't want the other men
finding out about this yet.
Pictures in <i>LIFE?</i> Wine, women and song?
You gotta tell them. They'll go nuts.
I don't want them going nuts.
I want them thinking about their jobs.
Come on, we could do our jobs in
our sleep. Why can't they know?
Because I said so.
(SCOFFS)
My father used to say that.
Dennis, you're the boss. You tell the
crew whenever you think it's right.
Now, can we have
just one more shot?
What? Are you kidding me?
- What are you smiling about?
- Ha-ha-ha.
You're the one that put this
unclean deck in this barracks.
Okay, get your money. Once
again, Jack Bocci gets stiffed.
(SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)
Clay, shouldn't you let the sarge
go through Becker's stuff?
Sarge will just send
it to Becker's widow.
We don't want her getting
anything embarrassing.
- Candy bar.
- Me.
Danny, which one of these do you like better?
This one's shiny aluminum. It's very modern.
And this one is a little more homey,
with the brick and the little bushes.
- This one. Why?
- Well, it's important, see.
I'm gonna plan to open a bunch of
restaurants exactly like the first one.
So you could go to Detroit and
get the same hamburger...
you got in Baltimore
or in Philadelphia...
Nobody's gonna want the same
old food everywhere they go.
Sure they do. It's comforting.
- It's com... It is comforting.
- CLAY: Love letters.
- Wife or girlfriend?
- Ooh, read them out loud. Get me in the mood.
Girlfriend.
- Pocketknife. Photos.
- Does he have any clean socks in there?
Hey. Dirty book.
Hey, I'll take it.
Ah.
Hey, look.
- Becker forgot his good-luck charm.
- Poor slob.
Should've worn it around his neck.
Then he'd never forget it.
- Rubbers.
- RICHARD: Dibs!
Virge the Virgin won't need these.
Promise me if you ever lose
your cherry, you'll tell me.
I'll send it to you COD.
Say, Clay, give me.
Becker owed me 10.
- DANNY: Jack, don't take his money.
- Hey, clam up, you mug-face, he owed me.
What do you guys
know about Germany?
- Pretty women.
- Good beer.
- The hamburger's named after a town there.
- Yeah. Ha, ha.
A little bird tells me that's where
they're sending us tomorrow.
- Are you sure?
- Uh, we ain't going to Crowdville.
Our plane's broke.
- VIRGE: No, it's fixed.
- Christ, let's go break it.
They wouldn't send us to
Germany our last time.
- They'd send us on a milk run to France.
- I hope so.
They would.
Anybody want the rest of this stuff?
Who wants the cigarettes?
JACK: Let me take the razor blades.

You've never had a hamburger? Unbelievable.
You don't know what you're missing.
They sound wonderful.
It's been so long
since I had any meat.
See, I work the meat very slowly, you
know, very tenderly. That's the secret.
And I rub in a little Worcestershire
and add a little garlic, a little thyme.
And then I ease it into a patty very
gently so I don't bruise the meat.

Hey. You're no dummy, Luke.
We both know that.

He'd murder me. This is...

This is our target area right here.
Long, rectangular buildings. The only
long, rectangular buildings in the area.
You can't miss them.
Note this S-shaped road going through
the factory for your sighting.
The Flugzeugbauer factory is a major
assembly plant for 190 fighter planes.
Now, you're leading
the group today.
Three hundred and sixty planes
are bombing on your command.
So let's be accurate.
This is a civilian area here.
This is a hospital. These are houses.
This is a school and a playground.
Note the railway tracks
north-northwest.

- Bremen?
- Oh, we're dead men. We're dead.
- Shut up, Rascal.
- You shut up, Virgin.
- Cut it out.
Clay, what are the odds today?
You figure they're gonna
overload us with bombs...
so it's 30-to-1 we'll crash and
blow up on takeoff, right?
Then they're gonna throw every
fighter they got at us...

Nothing.

say you have a little trouble in the tail.

the gun for five minutes.

Captain!
You're going up. Start engines
in five minutes. Five minutes.
(CHATTERING)
Say, lieutenant, lieutenant, um...
I was thinking, if you really want to,
you can come back and fire my gun.
- I'm not giving you my dog.
- Oh, lieutenant.
I don't want that flea-bitten,
mangy old pooch anyway.
VIRGE: Okay. Wake up,
Phil. Time to go to work.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA)
Here we go, boys.
Okay, Mona baby. We're gonna
get us a nice 109 today.
We did it before,
we'll do it again.
Sweet-talking your gun won't help,
Jack. Just straight shooting.
Hey, shut up, Gene.
Well, you know, when I got
my two Nazi fighters...
Hey, shut up.
(LAUGHS)
Okay, Jack.
- Climb power.
- I know.
- Watch the cowl flaps.
- I know.
Look out! Oh, my God!
(SIGHS)
Luke, take over for a minute.
Hey, it's <i>Baby Ruth.</i>
Who's our right wingman?
<i>Mother and Country.</i>
Oh, swell. The rookie crew.
- Soup?
- No, thank you, sir.
- Luke?
- LUKE: No, thanks.
- Captain, okay if I arm my bombs?
- DENNIS (OVER RADIO): Yeah, go ahead.
- Val, take this.
- You're not gonna die.
Just in case.
You're flak-happy. Now, just
do your job and shut up.
Bombs armed.
Rascal, there's nothing
wrong with the ball turret.
- Don't worry your pretty head about it, Virge.
- I'm just doing my job, Rascal.
Oh, now you do it?
Thanks a lot, buddy.
- Okay?
- Yes, thank you.
We're at 10,000 feet. Let's
hear those oxygen checks.
<i>LUKE (OVER RADIO):
Clay, how you doing back there?</i>
CLAY: Well, I'm doing
just fine, lieutenant.
PHIL: Captain, we're exactly 5 miles
south-southwest of Great Yarmouth.
We're in formation. This
is the rally point.
DENNIS:
Okay, boys. We're on our way.
Okay, listen, men. I'm showing
30 below zero up here.
<i>(OVER RADIO) Let's be careful.</i>
<i>Don't touch your guns with your bare
hands or they'll freeze right to it.</i>
<i>I don't want anyone losing
any fingers up here.</i>
<i>Keep checking your masks
for frozen saliva.</i>
<i>That ice gets down there and
blocks your oxygen flow.</i>
<i>- I don't want anyone passing out on me.</i>
- Yeah, yeah.
- RICHARD: In short, don't drool.
<i>- DENNIS: In short, check your mask, Rascal.</i>
All right, let's keep
the intercom free.
<i>Call out those fighters and don't shout.
We can hear you loud and clear.</i>
<i>Let's make this our best run yet, boys,
one that we can really be proud of.</i>
VAL: Right in the pickle
barrel, huh, Dennis?
<i>DENNIS: That's right. Keep your
minds on your job, work together...</i>
<i>and stay alert.</i>
Captain, I'm getting A.F.N.
here. Can I put it on?
<i>- RICHARD: Yeah, yeah.
- VIRGE: Please, sir? Come on, captain.</i>
<i>DENNIS: All right, Danny,
but when I say that's enough...</i>
<i>WOMAN (SINGING ON RADIO):
Why do breezes sigh every evening</i>
<i>Whispering your name as they do?</i>
<i>And why have I the feeling
Stars are on my ceiling?</i>
<i>I know why and so do you</i>
<i>CHORUS: When you smile at me</i>
<i>I hear gypsy violins</i>
EUGENE: Lord have mercy, Jack.
<i>WOMAN: When you dance

I'll give you heaven, honey.
<i>I can see the sun when it's raining</i>
(STATIC AND DISTORTED SINGING OVER RADIO)
(RADIO WHINES THEN MUSIC STOPS)
Okay, let's test our guns.
(GUNFIRE)
Little friends, 3 o'clock high.
Oh, God.
I'd give anything to fly a fighter.
You're all alone. You can
do anything you want.
That's flying.
It's the best pen money can buy.
- Why can't I have the baseball cards?
- They're for him. Here you go, Jack.
I'm more of a football fan myself.
You know the Bears?
There. Happy?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Thanks, Jack.
Thanks, Genie.
<i>STAN (OVER RADIO): Mother and Country
calling Memphis Belle. Come in.</i>
- DANNY: Read you, <i>Mother</i>. What's wrong?
<i>- STAN: Nothing, Danny. I just had a question.</i>
DANNY: Stan, we're not supposed to use
the radio unless it's an emergency.
<i>STAN: Oh, sorry. It was
about my log book.</i>
<i>Whether I should write down every radio
communication I hear or just some of the, uh.</i>
DANNY: Write down everything. Later on
you'll figure out what's important.
- We better sign off.
<i>- STAN: Okay, thanks, Danny.</i>
<i>I won't bother you again.</i>
DANNY: Hey, smile, I'm gonna
take your picture here.
Hope it comes out.
<i>DENNIS: Okay, boys, we're getting close to
enemy territory now, so let's be on guard.</i>
<i>Call out the fighters as
soon as you see them.</i>
EUGENE: Clay, you sure sang great last
night. You should do like we keep saying.
After the war, go to Hollywood and get
a record contract like Frank Sinatra.
JACK: Yeah, so we can
say we knew you when.
CLAY: No. I'm gonna get a nice little farm,
a nice little wife, and settle down.
Luke's the one who should go to Hollywood.
Shoot, he could star in the movies.
LUKE: Man. Maybe. Maybe.
I don't know what I'm gonna do
after the war, except not work.
RICHARD: Yeah, Luke, why go back to the daily
grind of being a lifeguard? Take it easy.
VIRGE:
I know exactly what I'm gonna do.
RICHARD: Oh, Virge, if I hear one more
word about that stupid restaurant...
VIRGE: It's not stupid.
At least I've got a plan. What are
you gonna do after the war, Rascal?
RICHARD: Come to your
restaurant and rob it. Ha, ha.
<i>JACK (OVER RADIO): Valentine's the
smart one. He's almost a doctor already.</i>
<i>Hey, what kind of doctor
you gonna be, Val?</i>
VAL: A rich one.
What about Phil? What's he
gonna be after the war?
I know. A mortician.
(CHUCKLES)
DENNIS: Well, hey, fellas, think about this.
My family has a furniture business.
We make furniture and then we sell it.
You could all come to work for me.
Like I said, don't
give it a thought.
LUKE: Yeah, that's just what we need, you
ordering us around for the rest of our lives.
"Let's do the preflight check."
<i>- RICHARD: Yeah. "Don't hog the intercom."
- JACK: "Call out them fighters."</i>
<i>- DANNY: "Check your masks."
- CLAY: "Let's make this our best run yet."</i>
(MEN CHUCKLING)
DENNIS: I'm not that bad.
CLAY: Say, Danny-boy, you didn't say
what you're gonna do when it's all over.
DANNY: Clay, I don't even like to think about it.
I mean, what if something happens?
I mean, well, we could all be old
men by the time the war is over.
(SIGHS)
It just seems so far
away, you know?
I'm sorry, fellas.
<i>EUGENE: Bandits, five o'clock.</i>
LUKE: Go get them, little friends.
<i>DENNIS: Hold your fire until Jerry's in
range. Don't waste your ammunition.</i>
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(GUNFIRE)
<i>- VIRGE: Six o'clock high.

<i>PHIL: Two 190s, 12 o'clock high.</i>
<i>EUGENE: Three fighters, 9 o'clock coming
around. Keep your eyes on them.</i>
<i>VAL: Top turret, 11 high.
Can't reach them.</i>
VIRGE:
Got them in my sights, lieutenant.
<i>DENNIS:
Bogey, 4 high. Danny, see him?</i>
<i>VIRGE: Two more, 12 o'clock
high, coming fast.</i>
(GUNFIRE)
VIRGE:
Couple coming in faster. Too high.
- EUGENE: I've got another one on my back.
- JACK: I'm on him.
<i>DENNIS (OVER RADIO): Two went low.
Watch them, waist gunner.</i>
<i>RICHARD:
They're flying close today.</i>
<i>DANNY:
5 o'clock high. Looks like a 190.</i>
<i>JACK: This guy at 10, he's smoking.</i>
<i>EUGENE: I saw the left waist
of Mother and Country hit him.</i>
<i>JACK: Son of a bitch. First
time out, he gets a kill.</i>
<i>VIRGE: He's bailing out.</i>
(GUNFIRE)
<i>DENNIS: Call out any planes you see going
down so Danny can put them in his log book.</i>
<i>CLAY: You know, we've done
this before, captain.</i>
<i>DANNY: Fighters at 9, but
they're staying away.</i>
<i>JACK: One at 10:30.</i>
<i>- DANNY: Ten-thirty high or low?
- JACK: Low, low.</i>
<i>- JACK: Here they come.
- CLAY: Looks like we got company, 7 o'clock.</i>
<i>VIRGE: One-oh-nine, 3 o'clock.
Somebody's going down, 2 o'clock.</i>
<i>VIRGE: 109s coming at 10 level.</i>
Come on. Come on.
Come to Papa, you son of a...
(GRUNTS)
<i>I almost had him. Damn it.
Hey, Wiener.</i>
EUGENE: He's coming around again.
Jack, get the greedy bastard.
EUGENE:
Two more at 6. They're coming in.
They're going after
the first flight.
<i>Windy City's</i> on fire.
- PHIL: Why don't they do something?
- VAL: Come on, bail out, you guys.
PHIL: Come on, wake up. Get out.
VAL: Jesus, there's a hole
in the pilot's window.
DENNIS: Hold on.
- LUKE: Call in.
- JACK: Tail.
RICHARD:
Ball turret. Get us out of here.
- EUGENE: Right waist.
- DENNIS: Keep calling in.
- VAL: Bombardier.
- DENNIS: Navigator, check in.
<i>- DENNIS (OVER RADIO): Navigator.</i>
- VAL: Phil.
PHIL: Here. Navigator checking in.
<i>DENNIS: When I say check in,
that means right away.</i>
VAL: Somebody's guts
are all over the nose.
<i>DENNIS (OVER RADIO): Any damage?
Crew, check your stations.</i>
- VAL: Nose okay.
<i>- CLAY: Tail okay.</i>
<i>- DANNY: Radio room okay.
- DENNIS: Keep calling out those bandits.</i>
(PANTING)
VIRGE: They're gone.
CLAY: Yep. Hit and run.
DANNY: Captain, I just heard from C Cup.
They're taking over the lead.
- DENNIS: You hear that, Val?
- VAL: Roger.
DENNIS:
Okay, C Cup's lead plane now.
- When they drop their bombs, so do we.
<i>- VAL: Got it.</i>
<i>Any chutes from Windy City?</i>
JACK: Them guys didn't even have
time to pee in their pants.
- VIRGE: Here one minute, gone the next.
<i>- CLAY: If you gotta go, that's the way.</i>
Listen, do we have
to talk about it?
RICHARD: Hey, fellas, I heard a good one
from the waist gunner of <i>Windy City.</i>
What was his name?
- JACK: Cooley.
- RICHARD: No, I mean the left one.
JACK: What, am I talking
to myself? Cooley.
- RICHARD: I mean the right one.
<i>- VIRGE: I know the guy.</i>
- RICHARD: Tall guy?
<i>- CLAY: He wasn't so tall.</i>
RICHARD:
Well, everybody's tall to me.
<i>- VIRGE: Lindquist.</i>
- RICHARD: No, no, no.
<i>- VIRGE: Something like that.
- RICHARD: Virge, you're not even close.</i>
Anyway, a plane gets shot down. The guy
bails out and the gestapo gets him.
His leg is broken, so they have to
amputate. He says, "Do me a favor."
<i>After you cut it off, give
it to one of your pilots</i>
<i>and have him drop it over
my base in England."</i>
<i>And they do it.</i>
<i>- DENNIS: Don't tie up the intercom.
- RICHARD: Wait, this is a quick one.</i>
The next week, they cut
off his other leg.
He says again, "Will you drop it
over my base?" And they do it.
The next week, they
gotta cut off his arm.
<i>He asks one more time, "Will you
please drop it over my base?"</i>
This time, they say, "Nein,
this we can't do anymore."
And he says, "Why not?" And they say:
“We think you're trying to escape."
(ALL LAUGHING)
<i>- CLAY: Son of a gun.
- VIRGE: I don't get it.</i>
That was pretty good, Rascal.
I think even Dennis liked that one.
Stoller. That's the
guy's name. Stoller.
JACK: No, no, no.
<i>VIRGE:
Stoller wasn't on Windy City.</i>
- EUGENE: You sure?
- JACK: Wait, it'll come to me here.
CLAY: Oh, yeah.
I can see that guy's face.
VIRGE: Yeah, me too.
RICHARD:
Well, whatever his name was...
it was a good joke.
DENNIS: Okay, men.
Let's stop fooling around.
Jerry's out there.
Let's look sharp.
Damn. Are the little
friends leaving already?
<i>VIRGE: Well, they sure know
when to run out of fuel.</i>
<i>CLAY: They ain't dumb.</i>
EUGENE: My medal. Oh, my God,
my medal. Where...? Where's...?
My medal, have you seen it?
(METAL TINKLING)
Hey, Wiener.
- Thanks, buddy.
- Here.
No!
- Why'd you do that?
- Now we're even!
(EUGENE YELLING)
- DENNIS: Right waist. Right waist, call in.
<i>- EUGENE: I'll kill you!</i>
Radio operator, get back there
and see what's happened.
(JACK SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
DANNY: Hey, hey!
JACK: Don't ever touch me when
I'm on my gun. You hear me?
DANNY: Break it up! Jack!
- Break it up.
- JACK: Get him back on his guns.
- Gene.
- EUGENE: What?
- What happened?
- Jack threw my medal out the window.
(SOBBING)
I'm finished, Danny. I'm finished.
No, you're not. Look, here. Here,
take my lucky rubber band.
It works. I swear to God it works.
You'll be all right. You okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.
- You'll be okay. I want it back.
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
(GRUNTS)
<i>DENNIS:
Navigator, give us a position.</i>
Sir, that's the Third
Reich down there.
JACK:
Now the shit really hits the fan.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Sir, uh, I think you
better come take a look.
BRUCE: No, we gotta liven
up that whole area.
And make sure the banner
is centered, right?
CRAIG: What's the meaning of this?
Then put the piano up on the platform.
It's just a little party, colonel.
I did not order this.
I didn't order this.
Leave this stuff to me. The
<i>Memphis Belle</i> is my job.
And my job is to approve
everything on this base.
I did not authorize a homecoming.
Craig, you're working a little
hard at being a hard-ass.
What's the harm in a little party in
honor of these guys? They're special.
I have 24 crews up there.
They are all special to me.
(CHUCKLES)
That's a great story, but baloney's
my business. I know it when I see it.
All you care about is getting planes
in the air, results, brownnosing HQ.
- The only man in the whole...
- Come with me.
You don't care if these men live or die.
It's just another airplane. If it was...
Sit down.
Start reading.
(BRUCE SIGHS)
This one's from a father whose son
had his head blown off over Lorient.
- Craig, I think you're cracking up.
- Read it!
<i>BRUCE (INTERNAL):
"Dear Colonel Harriman:"</i>
<i>Thank you for your
letter about Tommy.</i>
<i>He was only at your base a month...</i>
<i>but must have made a big impression because
you described him down to his boots.</i>
<i>I wish you could have told me...</i>
<i>how Tommy died, but I guess we have
to be careful about security and all.</i>
<i>I'm glad he was brave and
did his job to the end.</i>
<i>Maybe his mother and I
raised him right after all.</i>
<i>I guess we'll get used to him being
gone, but not too soon, I hope.</i>
<i>"I can always read your letter,
and that will bring him back."</i>
<i>WOMAN 1: Dear sir: Your
letter of December 10th...</i>

<i>I have been living in the false hopes that
the telegram I received was a mistake.</i>
<i>MAN 1: Dear sir: I am writing
on behalf of my parents...</i>
<i>who appreciated your letter to
them about my brother's death.</i>
<i>We were all glad to know
that Frank didn't suffer...</i>
<i>and was not alone when he died.</i>
<i>WOMAN 2: I saw him off at the train
station when he left to go overseas.</i>
<i>He was happy and excited to be doing
something important with his life.</i>
<i>He couldn't stop looking at
the stripes on his shoulder.</i>
<i>WOMAN 3: I hope when this is over,

Captain, I just heard from C Cup.
They're dropping out of formation.
We're in the lead now.
EUGENE: Bye-bye, C Cup.

What are you laughing about?
It's a scratch. Look, it's nothing.
And you're screaming like a stuck pig.

They destroyed my

Oh, you rotten son of a bitches!

You son of a bitch. You
scared the shit out of me.
How'd you do that?
(FLAK EXPLOSIONS)
Magic.
<i>VAL: Flak, 12 o'clock level.</i>
<i>Here we go.</i>
LUKE: They got something like 500
antiaircraft guns around Bremen.
VIRGE: I could live without
knowing that, lieutenant.
<i>JACK: Hey, Clay, what are the odds
of us getting out of here alive?</i>
Uh, just figuring that out.
Damn.

<i>- DENNIS: What's wrong, ball turret?</i>
RICHARD: A big piece of Nazi
flak just hit my turret.
<i>- DENNIS: Well, are you okay?</i>

<i>- DENNIS: You guess or you are?</i>
- RICHARD: I am.
All right. I hope everybody's
wearing their flak jackets.
<i>STAN: Mother and Country
calling Memphis Belle.</i>
<i>Danny, this flak is not like I expected.
Can't the captain fly above it or something?</i>
DANNY: No, we've gotta fly straight
through it or we'll be off target.
- It's just, uh, 4 minutes.
<i>- STAN: Yeah, just.</i>
(THUD)
DENNIS: Bombardier, I'm
turning on the autopilot.
You're flying the plane
from here to target.

- No, I'm not. You're in shock.

- Hey, I'm on the bomb run.
- Well, it's definitely not me.
Definitely not me either.
DENNIS: It's gotta be somebody!
There's blood all over the cockpit!
It's tomato soup.
(LUKE CHUCKLES)
(THUD)
What was that?
There's a hole as big as
my dick in the left wing.
We're losing fuel.
Virge, get on the
fuel-transfer pump.
Oh, the electrics must
be out on the left side.
The pump's not responding.
I'll do it by hand.
Luke, get back there, give him a hand.
We need to save as much fuel as we can.

VAL: Bombardier to pilot. Target is
covered. Looks like a smoke screen.
Fuel transfer complete.
I think we saved a little.
Bombardier, how does
that target look?
VAL: Target totally obscured.
VAL: Thirty seconds to target.
(THUDDING)
DENNIS: Listen, Val, I need those bombs on
target. The whole group is bombing with us.
VAL:
Well, if I can't see, I can't see.
- What do you think you're doing?
- We came to bomb a factory.
We're gonna bomb a factory, even
if it means going around again.
Going around on a bomb run is suicide.
That's like asking the Nazis to blow us...
Luke, I'm in command.
VAL:
Captain, what do you want me to do?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Shit.

- Just drop them, Val.
- Just shut up!
Please.
<i>DENNIS: It'll take five minutes to get
back to the start of the bomb run.</i>
Navigator, give me a position.
<i>- Navigator. Did you hear me?</i>
- PHIL: Yes, sir.
<i>DENNIS: Everybody listen.</i>
I know you wanna drop the bombs
and get the hell out of here.
But there's civilians down there.
There's a school next door.
If we don't drop these in the pickle barrel,
there's gonna be innocent people killed.
- What's the difference? They're all Nazis.
- Luke, shut up.
Now, I don't wanna do this
any more than you do.
We were sent here
to bomb a factory.
<i>If we don't do it, somebody's gonna have
to come back here again and do it for us.</i>

Bandit, 12 o'clock high.
Cockpit, he's heading for you.
What am I supposed
to do, spit on him?
- Tail gunner, how you doing back there?
- CLAY: I'm just peachy, lieutenant.
Well, if you need any
help, let me know.
<i>CLAY: I sure will, but I think
I'm doing fine right now.</i>
Oh, lieutenant, um, actually,
I do need some help back here.
- Tail gunner, what's wrong?
<i>- CLAY: I'm running out of ammo.</i>
I'll take care of it.
Why can't somebody else do it?
Left waist, right waist.
<i>JACK: Chief, we got fighters
all over us back here.</i>

Okay. But make it fast.

Great.
I owe you one, brother.
Nice view you got out here.

<i>JACK: Ball turret, 109
coming in about 7 low.</i>
<i>RICHARD: I'm on him. Two of them,
3 high. Keep your eyes on them.</i>
<i>VIRGE: Seven level, coming
in like a son of a bitch.</i>
LUKE:
I got him. I got him! Whoo-hoo!
<i>I got him!</i>
(SCREAMS)
RICHARD: It's the rookies.
They got the rookies.
<i>DANNY: Memphis Belle to
Mother and Country. Come in.</i>
<i>Memphis Belle to Mother
and Country. Come in!</i>
<i>STAN:
Oh, my God, oh, no! Oh, God, no!</i>
(STAN SCREAMING)
<i>ROOKIE: Oh, Jesus Christ, no!</i>
(STATIC AND WHINING OVER RADIO)
(STATIC AND WHINING STOPS)
DENNIS: How many chutes
from Mother and Country?
<i>EUGENE: I saw two.</i>
RICHARD: Yeah, two.
<i>PHIL:
Captain, this is the bomb run.</i>
DENNIS: Okay, bombardier.
I'm turning it over to you.
- VAL: Roger.
- DENNIS: It's all yours, Val.
Luke, after delivery, on
the way to rally point...
I'm gonna take some evasive action
to avoid this flak. Be ready on rudder.
Whatever you say, Dennis.
You know what you're doing.
Bombardier, how does
that target look?
Like shit.
VAL:
Captain, I still can't see a thing.
Oh, Lord, come on.
Bombardier, how does
that target look?
Target's still covered, captain.
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>
<i>Captain, do you read me?</i>
DENNIS: Yes, I read you.
My sight says I'm over the target.
I've gotta do something.
<i>Now, what do you want me to do?</i>
VAL: That's it.
That's it. That's it. Bombs away.
(BOMBS WHISTLING)
Okay, boys, we've done
our job for Uncle Sam.
Now we're flying for ourselves.
VAL: Bomb doors closing.
JACK: Jerry, breaking low to 9 o'clock.
Ball turret, watch it. Watch it.
RICHARD: I'm jammed. I'm stuck again.
Oh, shit, I'm stuck again.
Virge, get me out of here.
Virge, get down here and help me.
He's coming right at me. I'm jammed again!
Virge, help!
Rascal!
(RICHARD SCREAMING)
VIRGE: Grab hold of me. I'll undo
your safety strap. Hold on, okay?
- Come on up here, buddy.
- RICHARD: Oh, Jesus, help me!
VIRGE: Grab on to me. I got you,
Rascal, I got you! Grab hold of me!
Come on. Come on, Rascal, come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
(RICHARD GROANING)
You're okay. You're safe.
You're safe.
You're all right. You're gonna be okay,
okay? Listen to me. You're all right.
You're okay, all right? You're okay.
Come here. You're okay.
You're okay. You're going home.
You're going home.
- LUKE: Now what?
- DENNIS: Call in.
<i>- Call in now.</i>
- VIRGE: Grab the fire extinguisher!
I'll take care of Danny.
Rascal, watch Danny!
- Danny's hurt.
- Val, Danny's hurt.
<i>- Get back there and see what you can do.</i>
- Well, how bad is it?
<i>DENNIS:
Well, I guess it's pretty bad, Val.</i>
- What are you doing? It's Danny.
- I can't. There's fighters...
- I'll cover your gun. Just go.
- VAL: Maybe somebody in the back can...
Hey, hey, you're the doctor.
That's just it.
I'm not, Phil. I lied.
I had two weeks of medical
school before I enlisted.
I don't know anything.
You just do it.
(VAL BREATHING HEAVILY)
<i>CLAY: Captain, somebody just
shot a big chunk out of the tail.</i>
There's a fire in Number 4.
DENNIS: Cut fuel. Feather prop.
Fire extinguishers. Generator off.
(BOTH YELL)
- Call out those fighters.
- Oh, jeez. Danny's in bad shape.
- How's Rascal?
- He's okay.
The extinguisher's not working.
Gotta do something quick or
we're gonna lose that wing.
We gotta dive.
- I'm gonna need your help to pull out of it.
- I'm not going anywhere.
<i>DENNIS: Memphis Belle to Group.</i>
We're gonna have to dive to put out
this fire. Wingman, you're lead plane.
Everybody, hang on.
(ENGINE WHIRRING)
LUKE: Two seventy-five.
- We're exceeding maximum dive speed.
- DENNIS: We've gotta level her out.
LUKE: Fire's not out. Just a bit more.
A bit more and we're gonna lose the wing.
Trust me. Just a few seconds more.
Come on, baby, come on.
LUKE: It's out!
Come on, baby. Hold on, hold on.
(DENNIS AND LUKE GRUNTING)
(BOTH PANTING)
Crew, we're at 10,000 feet.
You can come off oxygen.
Thanks, Luke.
Once in a while, I'll
do something right.
I don't know what else to do.
He's lost a lot of blood.
- EUGENE: How far is it to base?
- On three engines, two, two and a half hours.
Two and a half hours?
He'll never make it.
- Val, help him.
- What do you want from me?
This man needs a hospital.
All I got is a stupid first-aid kit.
EUGENE: Here you go, Danny.
Okay, okay. There's one
more thing we can do.
RICHARD: What? Let's do it.
We can put a parachute
on him and push him out.
- Jesus Christ, Val.
- It's crawling with Germans down there.
- They'll take him to a hospital.
- If they don't kill him.
It's his only chance. Another crew
did it. This guy lost an arm.
- But that guy was conscious.
- Danny can't even pull the cord.
We can pull it first.
- He could fall in a lake.
- Val, can't we wait?
We'll be over the North Sea in
10 minutes. It's gonna be too late.
Well, if we're gonna do it,
we're gonna have to do it now.
- RICHARD: Watch his back.
- EUGENE: Keep his head up.
- EUGENE: Don't push, don't push.
- JACK: Careful, careful. Come on.
All right, Val, I'll go along with
anything you say. You're the doctor.
We just don't have a choice.
We've gotta do it.
- Tell the men that's my decision.
- Dennis...
Phil, I don't want any argument.
PHIL: Val, Val.
- Please don't do it.
- It's his only chance.
You're his only chance, but
you're too chicken to help him.
If he stays on board, he'll die.
PHIL: If you throw him out, he's
gonna die, and you know it.
PHIL: Val, you can save him.
So what if you're not a doctor yet?
You can help him. I know you can.
Val, he needs you. He's gonna die.
Don't do this, Val. You'll always
regret it. I know you're scared.
But we're all scared.
Now go help Danny.
Let's go. All right, hold
his head. Okay. All right.
MAN 1: Come on, baby.
- MAN 2: Come on, Babe Ruth.
- MAN 3: Let's do it.
MAN 1: Come on, baby.
(ALL GROAN)
MAN 4: There they are!
MAN 5: Seven.
- MAN 6: Eight.
- MAN 7: No, nine.
MAN 8:
Did you get that one over there?
- How many so far?
- Nine, sir.
- There's another one out there.
- And the <i>Belle?</i>
No, sir. Not yet.
Feather prop. Cut fuel.
Listen, men. We're flying
on two engines now.
Let's lighten up. Throw
out everything you can.
We're close enough to
home, so lose your guns.
We never did get that
fighter, did we?
Ah, shit on a stick.
Whoa, Emma. You can
have my bullets too.
Ain't that a pretty sight?
<i>DANNY:
I balanced all, brought all to mind</i>
<i>The years to come
seemed waste of breath</i>
<i>A waste of breath the years behind</i>
<i>In balance with this
life, this death</i>
Yeats.
It's okay, Danny.
I didn't write that.
It was W.B. Yeats.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
- I couldn't...
- VAL: Take it easy.
VAL: Don't do this to me, Danny.
Damn it.
Come on. Danny.
One more. One more like that.
(INHALES)
You try that again
and I'll kill you.
(CHATTERING)
Landing gear.
Somethings wrong.
Something is wrong. One
wheel didn't come down.
Take it back up. We'll belly-land.
LUKE: Nothing's coming up,
nothing's going down.
The electrics must be totally out.
All right. Virge, lower the wheel by hand.
Luke, tell me when it's down.
Crew, take positions
for crash landing.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way. Come on,
Jack. You gotta help me.
(GRUNTING)
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)
- We're losing Number 3.
- Are we out of fuel?
Fuel gauge is shot. How long
can we fly on one engine?
I don't know.
I guess we'll find out.
(GRUNTING)
Come on. Come on.
JACK: Get out of the way,
Virge. Move. Let me in there.
(SCREAMS)
Come on, come on. Faster, faster.
Come on. I got it, I got it.
<i>ALL (SINGING):
The pipes, the pipes are calling</i>
(ALL CONTINUE SINGING INDISTINCTLY)
Hurry it up!
PHIL: We're not gonna die.
We're not gonna die.
Oh, my God. It's only
got one wheel down.
(DENNIS GRUNTS)
Flaps.
PHIL: We're not gonna die.
We're not gonna die.
We're gonna live.

JACK:
We made it! We made it, Genie!
RICHARD: We're home, Danny-boy.
EUGENE: Oh, thank God.
(MEN LAUGHING AND SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
RICHARD:
Danny-boy, we're home. We're home.
(LUKE SIGHS)
- MAN 1: Easy, easy.
- MAN 2: I'm gonna need the IV.
VIRGE: I love you!
Welcome back, boys.
Terra firma, huh? Ha, ha.
We can clear this whole area out.
Just put him down in front.
This is fine.
Can we have the officers in front?
Uh, Luke, why don't you
come around in the front?
Okay, uh, now, officers in the center.
Luke, come here up front.
Just take the picture, Bruce.
CLAY: What's wrong, cap?
