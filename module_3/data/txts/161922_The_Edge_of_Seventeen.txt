I do not want to disturb too much...
but I'm going to commit suicide.
I thought someone should know.
I do not know how this works.
I probably jumping from
an overpass for a truck.
Maybe a moving van, but no bus.
I'm not a bitch that let people watch.
But it must be big.
It must be so great that it just...
over is. kills me. Lights off.
Because if it only maimed me, and I...
What do we have it? Then I look
for a sister to suffocate me.
How do I make it clear that I
choked want to be like me...
We need not go into details.
I thought that was an adult, you should know.
This is...
a lot to process, Nadine. I...
wish I knew what I had to say.
I was actually just own my
own farewell letter writing.
"Dear everyone.
As some of you know...
"I have 32 fleeting minutes of
happiness per school during lunch...
"Which repeatedly swallowed
up by the same...
"Particularly ragged student.
And I thought, finally, you know what?
"I prefer the dark, empty...
"Nothing. Really. It sounds...
"Relaxing.
"Have a good life without me, suckers."
You will be immediately dismissed if I really do.
- I'm not sure, but I can dream.
<i>Let me start at the beginning.</i>
<i>When I was in the 4th group,
I realized something.</i>
<i>There are two kinds of people in this world.</i>
<i>People who exude confidence and
naturally excel in life...</i>
<i>and the people who hope that those
people die when a huge explosion.</i>
Well, do your best, son.
<i>My brother Darian was a winner
from birth and had a million fans.</i>
Bye.
<i>His greatest? My mother.</i>
Bye, sweetheart.
Should you look, I won.
All right, young lady. See you tonight.
Nadine. We're not going to do this again.
You promised, now step out of the car.
I'm baffled.
<i>You could say that my mother and I
are not really two peas in a pod.</i>
<i>And the only one with both
of us knew to go was dad.</i>
I hate you.
<i>Dad had an almost impossible task...</i>
<i>to handle both of us.</i>
Okay.
I know kids can be cruel.
But if you get the chance...
then fart in their backpack.
I wish you were small.
<i>I had at least one person
to eat lunch with.</i>
<i>Instead, I received the most
attention in school of the three.</i>
No one like you.
You're worthless and you will get AIDS.
<i>My childhood was a blazing fire
and I no longer wanted to live...</i>
<i>in this intolerable, intolerable nightmare...</i>
Excuse me.
<i>And then, out of nowhere, an angel appeared.</i>
Can you please go to the side?
<i>She was dressed like a little elderly gentleman.</i>
<i>And her breath smelled tarts.</i>
Would you like to hold him?
But not crush him.
Hi, boy.
If you want you can have
other mother along with me.
Really?
I'll have another mother
and very good care of you.
<i>I let him choke back accidentally
two hours in my pencil box.</i>
<i>But I finally met my
first girlfriend.</i>
<i>We told each other things we
never thought to say aloud.</i>
Once blurted my grandfather's
pajamas accidentally open...
and I saw his wiener and
then became very sad.
My mother should they take different
medicines are upset and they buy too much.
Really.
<i>Krista's life turned out not to be perfect.</i>
This pudding is delicious.
- I walk away now.
You think I'm your mother?
Do you need a babysitter?
<i>But we helped each other through it.</i>
We can play with this.
We can play with Mr. Penguin.
<i>The following years were magical.</i>
<i>And then there happened a few extreme things.</i>
Oh my God.
I knew it.
It is really only the hair.
It's not so bad, you can
just grow your hair.
Is there anybody there?
Check it out, I have to pee.
<i>Darian, by contrast, was only prettier.</i>
<i>And acorn knew.</i>
<i>That evening I went to pick up
some cheeseburgers with my father.</i>
What good am I? Tell me that.
What have I ever had?
You very much. You have love.
You have my love.
Very soon you will have cheeseburgers.
Look.
Did not I tell you? Cheeseburgers.
Would you like fries?
That was Billy Joel.
You do not go past Billy Joel.
Dad?
Dad, are you okay? Pap.
Pap.
Dad?
<i>I will not depress you
with the details, so...</i>
<i>let's say that the few years
that followed were quite fucked.</i>
<i>Except for one thing. I had Krista.</i>
<i>This was last Friday.
Watch me, I was in a good mood.</i>
I love spoilers.
- No.
Yes. I do not watch it.
I know it and I can move on with my life.
I'll give you a hint.
I knew it. They are getting married.
He has become so sexy in juvenile detention.
I forgot to tell you something.
He now works at Petland.
I have to go in there and ask...
"Excuse me, where are the ornamental fish?
You can also stop your penis in me? "
I'm not talking to you.
What if you really did? What if you
really lost your virginity in a Petland?
I think it's something.
All small tropical fish watching.
It has something spiritual.
My God. Look at that stupid
shirt wearing my brother.
You can see his nipples.
- What he does not realize that...
it merely says: My body
complex is worse than a girl?
How much he trains really now?
It's a compulsion.
You should have seen him. He freaked out
because my mother no creatine buy more.
Because it destroys your kidneys.
I said: "I know, Darian.
What do Mom?
"That you can win people to
your character with you?"
I just want to say something, but
yesterday, when you taught us, you told...
"Bla-bla-bla, when the North
withdrew from the Union."
You had to say that the South seceded.
You said accidentally exact opposite.
I did not raise my hand and say:
"Excuse me, the children become confused."
I thought you wanted to know.
Well noticed.
I know it was a long lesson and
you do not attaching more...
but there was no time when
you thought to yourself...
"Gee, I wonder what it's like
to actually have a life."
No, I was too focused on how
it was to screw up, so...
I understand, but know that I
have not given up hope. Not yet.
You wear a nice sweater jogging today.
- Thank you.
How do you get it?
The sweater. Jogging Sweater.
No idea, I do not remember.
Coowlio.
I do not know where that came from.
What is his name?
- Erwin Kim.
I do not know him.
- You'd like him, he's cute.
What would you want with him?
- No, not that. More innocent cute.
In the sense that I want to carry
him around in a baby carrier.
Fine, I see you yet.
I'm glad.
Like this dress nice? It was ugly?
I think he is ugly.
It is quite fluffy and I do not know.
my arms look ugly?
You do not sound very credible
and you make me nervous, Nadine.
Your upper arms are breathtaking.
Where are you going?
It's at the last minute, but Brent called me.
That dentist.
And he asked me for a weekend meewilde
to Manzanita and I thought why not.
I may occasionally be
a bit selfish, so...
Is that one of the men Match.com?
- Yes.
You have to go as long as you want.
Very funny, I'll be back Sunday.
Just in time to surprise you.
I tried to call Darian...
He will now sit in his advanced study.
- I'll tell him.
Behave yourself.
What?
- I claim.
What are you saying?
Mom fucks two days with a dentist
in Manzanita, so I claim the house.
Gadver.
You're really sick you says so.
Mom tits dangling on the face of
the dentist. you see it for you.
See Mom tits in the face of the dentist.
I love you.
I love those teeth in your mouth.
That was your nose.
- You just stole my nose.
You are kidding me.
- Do a back flip.
Where are you going?
You should send these people to the pool.
Excuse me, have you all gone. Bye.
Nobody listens to you.
You said you would not drink until after
the football. You failed, failure.
I do not drink, this is orange juice, genius.
How drunk is she?
I had one drink.
Get your friends out of the pool now.
No.
- I'll call the police.
You get nothing. We go upstairs.
Excuse me, I'll call the police.
- You do retarded.
I call still. Hello, Central?
Can you please help me?
My brother hurts me in my forbidden spot.
Why am I so ridiculous?
Why do you think like me?
What's wrong with you?
Stop.
- I do not even like myself.
Yesterday I heard my voice on a voice mail.
How can anyone listen to it?
You're just drunk.
- I hate my face.
I hate how I look when
I talk or chew gum.
Let me chew gum.
And then I realized something terrible.
I have the rest of my life to live with myself.
Let's go to your room.
Want morning not wake up in your bed?
Do not you want that? Here you will not sleep.
Come on, Nadine.
Is there somewhere more aspirin?
- Maybe, but look there again.
No, you do not have to do.
- It is all right. So it goes faster.
What happened?
Someone left inside Baxter and he's pissed.
Can you do me a favor?
Will you give me some paper towels?
Cool. And clean up this hondenpis?
- Yeah right.
My God. What is this?
Get out of my room.
Stop watching, get out.
I do not know. I swear I
do not know what happened.
I do not even know how it happened.
It was...
I have no idea. Sorry.
Are you okay?
I think only a moment.
I'll see you later.
Nadine, you can not leave
without saying anything.
You're my best friend and I love you.
It was not your fault.
I find you disgusting.
- That is nice.
Grow a mustache, pervert and
stay away from my friends.
Did you say "friends" as in plural?
Your head is too big for your body. Therefore,
you look weird and that will never change.
Mr. Bruner.
I have not had a chance last
night's homework, because...
I do not know if you know,
but my father is deceased.
It is very difficult to do something.
Date of death?
Sorry?
- When did he die?
2011.
I have a maturity of one year
giveaways for the deceased.
Do you mean this seriously?
There will determine other times.
Your grandparents do not stay forever.
Sit down.
Okay, class, young Mr. Lincoln.
Enjoy it.
How was your weekend?
It was below average.
How was your weekend?
- Oh, I...
I waved.
You know, midget.
I mean minigolf.
No idea why I did that.
I will pick it up, but, yes.
Tim's Fun Park.
- Yes.
I love that place.
We should go sometime.
- Yes indeed.
But with a group of people
with multiple people.
Or just us.
- As in, just, just us?
I think...
- Or with a group.
Yes, a group.
That would be great.
- That's a lot more fun, right?
I speak to you again soon enough.
Nice man.
- See you later.
I just want to say that...
you are the friend of my sister
and what happened that night...
Yes thank you.
- That was so weird.
Yes, it was just...
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
- It was me because...
Anyway...
Cool. I see you...
- When at home or...
...elsewhere.
- Cool.
I thought it was really nice with you.
- Me too.
Sorry.
Just hold on.
It is all right.
Continue.
- That was weird, it was weird to do.
What do you want me to do, Nadine?
I want you to think about how
fucked up this is for me.
I know.
What if I were you would do this?
What if...
What if I like your father?
What if I was going to deduct your father?
Louis. you look so sexy
with that phone strap you.
Oh, Krista, you're home early.
Why? Why do you like him at all nice?
I do not know.
- You know that.
True. Is it a girl thing?
You've had some with him and now
you're emotionally attached to him?
Are you perhaps unconsciously angry
with me and this is a kind of revenge?
Are you unconsciously angry with
yourself and you punish yourself now?
Because if it is, then we can...
- Will you stop talking, because you're making me crazy.
Here you go.
Sorry.
He invited me to a
party on Friday.
And I want you to come with us.
So you go with him
and I can tow.
I'll see if I have nothing to do.
- Yeah, okay.
Thank you for coming.
- What? No, I'm really enjoying myself.
Maybe you can fuck
later on the lawn.
Try to stand above it, Nadine.
- Bag in shit, Darian.
Does it matter?
I want you to meet some people.
How is it going? This is Krista.
I'm Shannon.
You were right last year to me with chemistry?
Yeah, nice to meet you officially.
Great outfit. It's so much fun.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
- I love the lace and chain.
Want to play beer pong?
- Yes, I'd love to play beer pong.
I do not know many people here.
- That's okay.
You meet people, it's a good icebreaker.
- Sounds good.
I think I'm playing beer pong with them.
- Come on.
New player.
Do not be silly.
Why behave yourself so strange?
Have fun, just relax.
Go talk to people.
Okay. Perfect. That I will.
That's two cups.
- No idea how I did that.
Can I sit here?
Are you having fun?
- I feel pretty good.
I respect that.
Are not you Darian Franklin's sister?
Do you ever look at TBS?
Sometimes.
- They show very often see an old movie.
Arnold Schwarzenegger is in it and
scuffed from "It's always Sunny"?
They play twin brothers.
Only Arnold is big and muscular...
And the other is small and looks funny.
- Yes.
Twins.
- Yes.
I like that movie too crazy.
- It's so good.
You and your brother make me think that.
I want you to come pick me up.
How was it?
It was probably...
one of the worst nights of my life.
- You would not believe what kind of night I've had.
Sorry, I'm not.
What happened?
That dentist?
I was home tonight, to relax
with a glass of wine...
and I got an email from his wife.
I wanted to call Dr. Hill hysterically,
but then I thought, "No, Mona...
"You're going to deal with this yourself.
"Since 2011 you do everything yourself,
so that you going to do yourself."
I feel like such a loser.
- You're not a loser.
So I feel it.
- You're not a loser, Mom.
You are attractive.
You can decorate properly.
You are very careful with your eyebrows.
Suppose it had become what?
"Did you flossed today?
"Because periodontal disease
is a silent killer, Mona."
You know what I'm gonna do tonight?
I'm going home.
do my hair, pick up beautiful
makeup and put on my best dress.
Then pull everything back and
remove makeup and go to sleep.
Nice.
"Hey, Nick, a while ago I
sent you a friend request.
"You might have missed it.
"Or sometimes Facebook has a fault
which is not sent the email.
"So I thought...
"I'll report it to you but here."
My God.
You're really pathetic.
Hey?
<i>Nadine of history lesson.
What are you doing now?</i>
Hi, I...
I'm just...
Hi. Everything good? With me so.
Are you doing okay?
Everything good? Everything fine? What is it?
Sorry, I keep talking...
How are you? Everything good?
<i>Tim's Theme Park is open late tonight.
Would you like to meet there?</i>
Why did they cancel the party?
I meant more that I left.
Understood.
- Yes. Thank you drove.
I have no driver's license, why should
I, if you have people who can drive?
People make it so hard to
do things for themselves.
That was a joke, I'm not successful.
- Oh, hello.
Take him on.
- No. That's not necessary.
Look, there's no line at the Ferris wheel.
Tell me something I do not
know about you, Erwin.
What are your hopes and dreams?
Take me on a trip through your psyche.
- No idea. I think that I...
'm just a normal guy.
But what if you do should be about
dwell time that lasts this ride?
Right, yes.
- How are your parents?
My father...
- Wait, see if I can guess.
See if I'm psychic.
Here it comes.
Your mother sits on your neck
because of your results.
She makes delicious egg salad after
years of having had a restaurant.
Your father, silent, rough.
Never say that he loves you.
But with his stoic presence.
I mean, you know he cares.
I really hope that was not
racist, but now I think it was.
No. Not at all.
You are good.
What are you doing?
- Sorry. Bad time?
I thought it was the right
time, you're upset.
I wanted to reassure. Is that crazy?
- We can get better.
We must get out.
- Yeah, that was...
Excuse me, can we look?
Is that possible? Can fucking drive stopped?
Can we stop?
Sorry, I did not raise my voice.
- My God, Erwin.
Wait. What?
- You have him.
I've got it. Jesus mina.
- I've done it all by himself.
No one has seen.
We get out of here.
This was a fun evening.
I'm sorry I snapped at you...
the Ferris wheel.
- No, my timing was weird.
At this moment everything is against.
That is a long story.
I'm sorry that you have to experience.
You're a really nice guy.
No, I mean it.
When I look at you I
see a real, real...
real old man.
- Old?
I give you a compliment.
I see this very nice...
friendly, very wise, old man.
In a retirement home.
In a wheelchair.
Thank you.
I know you're mad at me
because you think...
I leave you to play
beer pong and...
I never said I was angry.
But I know that you're well and...
Nadine...
Want to know which observation
I have done this weekend?
Of course.
"My God, Shannon. Your outfit is so cute.
I think it's crazy. "
Yeah, okay.
- And you put me on the side?
One that since the 4th
group was on your side?
That much has been through with you. Fine.
Because the chances are that
fucks not to worry you...
as Darian dump you for someone who is prettier.
You know nothing, Nadine.
It sucks to hear.
Sorry. but it does happen.
No, I'm sorry, but it's
not going to happen.
Because your brother has asked me to
be his girlfriend in May at the prom.
No.
- Yes. He just asked me that.
That is not possible. You can not have both of us.
He or me. Choose.
No, I do not choose.
- It was him or me. Would you like him or me?
This is not a choice.
- Why do not you pick me?
He or I, now.
- No, I do not choose.
You know what? Then we're ready.
We are ready.
Fine.
Waking. You had brain surgery.
It helped.
They made you enjoyable and pleasant.
Ah, just idle daydreaming.
The bell has gone. Go away, please.
Yes. Just ignore her. She is...
I call you later. Bye.
I want to hear about it.
Fight it together but out.
In a few weeks, dad four years dead.
When I was on my way home, there
was a reminder to the top.
It was on that night,
after it happened.
I went to the bathroom and
I saw you cry so hard.
So hard that your pillow was soaked.
I was so sad.
I went to my room.
And grabbed my pillow.
And I took the wet myself.
I wish you loved me so much.
Asshole.
No. You really are cut so that
you arrive with that story.
You really screwed up. Do you realize
how crazy you are about to start?
I'm sorry that you only
care about yourself.
Oh yes, that's it.
- You're obsessed with yourself.
Your report on the fridge
stick if you're five years.
Hey, everybody.
Look, I got pooped on the big toilet.
Do you actually know how
it feels to love someone?
What did you say dramatically.
Life is sometimes unfair, Nadine.
Accept it.
- I swear to you, I'm gonna hit you.
Do not touch me. Calm down.
- Stop saying that.
Stop.
What's wrong with you?
I know what this is about.
- Not true.
Yes. Krista and Darian have something together.
You think I do not know
anything, but I know.
I'm going.
- No you will not do that. Where are you going?
I'm going to make a therapeutic walk.
- Come back.
My God. Darian.
- Do not worry about it.
May I ask you something?
Is it worth to turn the
house into a war zone?
What should I say?
- I imagine only the question.
I do not know, Mom. She does.
Why do not you talk to her?
Because they do not listen to me.
You do.
You will do the right thing.
I know that.
I mean, look at that drink that you make.
- Want one?
To what do I owe such a perfect child?
Could you tell me
where the litter is?
Eight, I believe.
You're in Lakewood, right?
- Sometimes.
I've seen you there.
We just never spoke.
Seventh grader?
- Third year.
I do not really need
cat litter, I...
I do not even know why I said that.
I do not even have a cat.
I know they poop a lot, so...
- I like your shoes pretty.
I have to go.
Look on the bright side.
Maybe they are going to marry.
"And then my best friend
will be part of my family."
That helps, thank you.
- I think it's annoying...
they do not bring to school.
I'll have to speak to her about it.
No you will not do that.
- I can not deliver every morning.
Thus, I'm 40 minutes late.
If you do, I'll just do
something terrible to you.
I tell everyone on Facebook that you know your hair
epilation around your nipples. What about that?
Say what you want to hear and I say it.
Mom.
- I want you to feel better.
What can I say to ensure this?
- I do not know.
This is what I do when I feel depressed.
I am very calm and quiet.
And I say to myself:
"Everyone in the world will feel
just as miserable and empty as me.
"They can just do better though."
Try it.
Maybe it gives you peace of mind.
Do you know where Erwin Kim?
He will sometimes hang stuck here.
Yes, he is working on his project for SFF.
- SF what?
The Student Film Festival.
- Right, yes.
I need to talk to you about homework.
I did not want to talk to
you about homework, I lied.
Do you enjoy my company?
- It's always a blast with you.
You never told me if you're married.
You might even have to go with my mother.
Her last boyfriend turned out to be an
internet pervert. She is very fragile.
Very much, "Oh, who saves me."
Of such men.
Because in the end they
all want to be a hero.
Everyone wants to feel
important in life.
Just how important they are, there
will always be someone important.
hit make people there so busy "Oh
no, they are better than me."
It's like they do not realize
are important does not matter.
It involves self-assurance.
The most confident person always wins.
It does not matter whether it is genuine.
Whether they make it up on the spot.
People are stupid. They see the difference.
You know what? I'm just telling you the
real reason why I am today with your lunch.
I have at the moment not really friends.
And to be honest, I'm not
interested in it at all.
My whole generation
consists only of sufkoppen.
They literally get a chance when
you take away their phones while.
They can not communicate without emoticons.
They really think...
want the world to know that:
"I eat a taco, exclamation, smiley, smiley."
As if something interests us.
I'm an old soul.
I love old music and movies...
and even old people.
The bottom line is that I have nothing
in common with the people out there...
and they have nothing in common with me.
Nadine?
- Max?
Perhaps no one likes you.
You're a jerk.
Perhaps no one likes you, huh?
You always have a pestbui.
You're a bad teacher.
You put no energy into
everything you do here.
Since you can not possibly be proud of.
Look at you again, you're doing nothing.
Should you see her.
You do you do it because you have no hair.
You're bald.
Do you know why you're not married?
Because bald men are dirty and especially
those who earn $ 45,000 a year.
I'm doing this for 23 years and...
you're the first one
underestimates my salary.
That gave me a good feeling.
That part then.
What are you doing?
- I'll give you half of my cookie.
Why?
So you feel better. Holy shit.
Guess.
You are my favorite pupil.
Does that help?
Am I really your favorite student?
- It seemed the right thing to say.
I mean besides not completely bald.
It's smart what you do with it.
Do you do anything up?
give it extra volume?
Good to see you again
started and have condoned.
That certainly gives me a better feeling.
No.
- Yes. I mean it. Exercising is so boring.
I heard you were looking for me during lunch.
- Yeah, I can not talk now.
I have...
Sorry, I've taken some medicine.
<i>I'll call you when they start working.</i>
Wait, what's wrong? Are you ill?
<i>No, I'm fine.</i>
Medications, such as antidepressants.
I got it when my father died.
I've just swallowed a month.
People swallow daily. It is quite normal.
Like me now suddenly pathetic?
<i>No there is...</i>
nothing wrong with you.
Seriously.
Do you have a pool?
- Yes.
May I swim in it?
I know...
<i>I can swim in the mine.
But I can not relax.</i>
<i>I have towels. We can be so.
We have a green light. I'll send you the address.</i>
I'll see you shortly.
Jeez, Erwin, I had been
much nicer to you.
I wish that my bathtub was so hot.
Why did not you tell
me that you're rich?
I have not done that?
I always try to tell to everyone.
You did not even tell me that you
participate in a film festival.
You tell me nothing, Erwin.
Maybe because I was not a
word could get between.
I really talk much?
- Oh yeah.
I'm going to drown myself. Goodbye.
- Bye.
Thanks for having me.
- I'm glad you came.
Will you have sex?
I was kidding.
It was just...
You do know that I was only a
scene from a movie naspeelde.
Have you ever feeling that you have to do that?
Come on, there is a waterfall. Very romantic.
Of course. Yes. Right.
Sorry. I wanted...
- Whatever.
Are you angry now?
You can not be angry.
Two seconds ago you wanted to have sex.
- Something you do not say to a man.
A man, huh?
Erwin, come back.
What are you going to do?
You are about to press a button
so I am flushed, or not?
My God.
Where you film all about?
- I'm still working on it.
My art teacher asked some of us
to start an animation project.
That is cool. I did not know you drew.
What kind?
Look please.
Damn, Erwin.
This is not finished yet.
What scribble.
But not exactly where I...
I think I have found my favorite.
- Yes, my parents also liked.
Really?
- No not really. They are very conservative.
That's you both, right?
- Yes, I'm versatile.
An excellent self-portrait.
Crikey, Erwin, you're very good.
Want Saturday come see the movie?
It is early in the morning, very
inconvenient, so I hope you say yes...
but you can think about it.
I expect now not an answer.
Because that would be rude.
And put too much pressure on you.
So, I leave it to you.
Yes, I would love to come.
Get your parents?
I could sit down with them.
My parents sit for
three months in Korea.
So that does not make it.
- Are you serious?
You had the whole house for
three months all to yourself?
I get it. It's a big house.
You are bored.
You know what you need?
You need someone who robs you, so
that your 'Home Alone' gunfight.
That is...
indeed exactly what I need.
Thank you.
I can not get out yet.
Would you like to drive around?
I'm not going to drive around.
We are here.
Bad timing.
I need to be eight thirty at work.
Holy shit.
Are we really going back on that tour?
You are kidding me.
Thank you. You can drive around in circles.
I'm going to work.
You're coming with me.
My boss will not be happy there, and
you're the one who can interpret it.
Do not you have anything to do?
Homework or something?
May I have this hole punch?
- Give it here.
I want you to sit there for the next eight
hours, nothing touches and makes no noise.
I might do pantomime?
You are not funny.
If my husband knew that I
have to ask all along.
Amazing how you refer to him as your husband.
He is my husband.
You can leave him and
find a new husband.
He's my father.
Can not say that occasionally?
Fine.
But we're not talking about it
because it makes me too upset.
"It is too difficult and sad
and I get headaches." I know.
Holy shit.
You have absolutely no compassion.
I am bored just because I know what
you're doing before you do it.
That will do.
- You do not believe me.
No indeed.
I write down what you will
immediately say to me.
I do not participate in your games.
Congratulations.
You know what?
Here's something you will not guess.
Your father would be so disappointed
in what you are becoming.
Did you just say took my keys?
Do not take that car.
I'm calling the police.
I'm calling the police.
Nick, I just say it.
I like you.
I think you like months.
I think all day about you.
Maybe I like it even you.
You're so complex.
But also simple.
And I just feel a bond between us.
It seems like I've known you,
I just wanna be with you.
I want to blow you.
I want you to do your
mouth on my breasts.
I want to feel you inside me.
We can do it in the
storeroom of Petland.
Nadine.
My God.
My God.
You sound like a psychopath.
This can not be sent to you.
<B> Submit. </ B>
What?
No.
<B> Sent. </ B>
My God.
My God.
No.
Damn.
My God.
I do not want to interfere too much,
but I'm going to commit suicide.
"You're complex.
And simple.
"I just feel a bond between us.
"It seems like I've known."
This is sweet.
I think you're overreacting.
"I just want to be with you.
I want you...
"Pipes.
"I want you to...
"Your mouth on my...
"Does breasts. I want you inside me...
feel ". We can...
"Do in the storeroom of Petland."
Say something.
Say something, please.
Help me.
You better pay attention to punctuation.
But can not you do something?
Can not you do something?
You should still be able to do anything.
Come on.
Maybe take his phone?
His computer.
You might find out his address.
You get behind his address, picks up his phone.
Find his address.
Give me that.
I go there and I...
- Nadine.
Take the fifth hour as free.
Try to relax.
Listen to some music.
Eat some yogurt.
Do take it easy.
Is that going to work?
If you have any problems,
please let me know.
Do not worry.
- Thank you.
It will be all right.
- Thank you.
I have some money for frozen yogurt?
I want to change it.
<i>I want you to know that I have
never before felt so humiliated.</i>
<i>I absolutely can not...</i>
<i>Now you have to pick up the phone.</i>
<i>I just do not understand.</i>
<i>If you think you can keep that
phone, then you are wrong.</i>
<i>The moment you get home,
you've lost your phone.</i>
<i>I am done. I'm done with
trying to understand you.</i>
God help me.
Why should I bother?
Why would I...
You never gave me anything.
Every time I ask you for anything, it is:
"Need help? Let me help you.
"I'm just kidding.
I'm going to continue sewing. "
Who is this?
<B> Nick. I read your post. </ B>
My God.
<B> You're so sweet.
Shall we meet tonight? </ B>
What?
Damn.
My God. Calm down.
Calm down.
Sounds good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
How many of them there are
such acorns, you think?
Shoot hell and will graduate.
Just hold on.
Krista tell about the time...
Wait. Talk equally quiet.
What do you mean?
Calm down.
I do my best to make you better.
We could win every game.
See you soon again.
Are you kidding?
- No, it's a long story.
Later.
- Later.
What happened?
- Nothing.
It's not nothing.
No, you have it to your liking. Just stay.
- I'm coming with you.
Thank you.
- Yes.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You too.
Mom?
Mom?
What are you doing?
It goes to the charity.
Everything.
All lying on the ground, go away.
- Calm down, okay?
No. I'm done with it.
This includes all.
Can you believe it?
It is all right.
- What is this?
What's all this mess?
- Please stop here.
Her hair tongs left to stand.
Can you stop, please?
- She wants to burn down the house.
This leaves.
Stop. Give it to me.
Give me the bag.
I'm the adult here, not you.
- Why do you call me please?
My God.
You're right.
Sorry.
I just have no one else.
You are the only one.
What are you doing?
- I will arrange it.
Look at this view
again, it's fantastic.
<B> Darian </ b>
<i>You know what to do, I'm
not gonna tell you.</i>
<i>You know what to do...</i>
I like this song too much.
It's really good.
I can not believe this is really happening.
There is so much that I wanted to tell and questions.
And I can not believe this is happening.
This just keeps going backwards, right?
Pull it down.
I do not know if...
Yes. Go ahead...
Wait, I have to...
- I'm not sure I...
No, get off me.
Get off me.
- Okay.
What the hell?
I thought that song really nice.
What is it again?
I do not know that anymore.
I googled it.
Anyway, we'll take a walk or something?
We can maybe catch a movie.
Or we all night can silently
sit in your Mercury Marquis.
Are you serious?
What?
- Do you now jokes about my car?
What? No.
I was just very specific.
I did not mean that he is bad, or something.
No not at all.
I find your car wonderful.
I do not even have a car.
I just do weird and this
is just too sudden.
And stop, please.
Please do not go.
What?
- I do not understand you.
What?
- What do you want?
What do you mean, what I want?
- What do you want?
Talk. You know better.
It did not do right in the first five seconds.
You almost wrote a book about how much
you wanted me pipes Petland, freak.
I'm not here to get to know you.
This is so stupid.
So stupid.
Why I did not listen
to my friends?
Come on.
Try me now make the bad guy?
You sent me a message.
I hope you run over in this rust bucket
into a tree. And that you become paralyzed.
We go, young lady.
Did you get a donut of these people?
No.
What...
Why is that baby at home?
- How is this thing here?
Hey.
This is Toby.
And this is Greer.
Hey.
- How are you?
Good. And with you?
- Good.
Nice to meet you.
What is the number of your mother?
Who needs smelly feet?
Let me smell me. Wait.
Toby has smelly feet.
Do not stare.
It makes him self-conscious.
Do you want anything? An ice cream or
something else, before I put the baby to bed?
No, thank you.
No, I can feed her from
here and watering.
Come on, little man.
They are now two of us, buddy.
Big boy.
I know the whole story, but
whatever it is, it will go over.
I had returned too heavy for a while.
But look what it got me.
- This is the face of hope.
Goodnight.
I'm coming.
- Fine, good night.
Goodnight.
- Say goodbye.
Goodnight.
- Bye dad.
Goodnight.
I think that's for you.
Come on.
No, that's not my mother.
Do not open the door.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
- Get in the car. We go.
No, mom picks me up.
- No, she does not.
Get in the car.
I do not want you to get in the car.
You know what I'm
doing all night?
I'll drive with someone else.
Get in the car.
- Stop.
You think I like this?
Let me go.
- You think I like this. Where were you?
Can you phone does not get that?
You do not have to pretend you care about
me because there are people watching.
Please, say.
You want nothing more than to take
me home so you can be mom's hero.
You will find totally amazing.
Never mind.
I want to say that you are absolutely right.
You have anywhere right.
I do not give one damn about you.
I'm just here for myself and
my life is totally awesome.
It is really fantastic.
I love to calm my mother.
For me to register with regional schools,
because what if I'm not there to regulate it?
I think it's so cute...
that one person where
I feel good at...
I can not do without
you helping fucked.
So you're right.
You're right. It is awesome.
I win.
Can you give her a ride home?
Thank you.
I'm not good at this sort of thing...
But we both know what needs
to be said now, so...
I say it straightforward.
Step out of the car.
Bye.
- I see you Monday.
I wanted to say...
I'm sorry I was such a bitch tonight.
The last weeks.
And the 17 year.
I know this is not easy for you.
I know that.
A crazy part of me thinks I'm the
only one with real problems.
As if that makes me special.
Since our childhood, I sometimes get the feeling...
as if I'm floating out of my
body and look down at myself.
And I hate what I see.
How do I behave, how I sound.
And I do not know how to change it.
I'm so afraid that feeling
will never go away.
Sorry.
Really.
Goodnight.
Hey, Nadine.
Goodnight.
- Good night.
You're up early.
Yes, I need to go somewhere.
Well, good day.
You too.
Have a nice day, you.
Good day.
- Thank you.
Can I call you later?
That was good. Right?
- That was very good.
I miss her.
Sit back, relax and
enjoy the movies.
Turn off your phone.
I pass there between?
Thank you. Sorry.
<B> I'm safe. </ B>
<B> Call me immediately. </ B>
<B> Nadine, you need me... </ b>
That was nice, right?
Let's move on.
Our next entry is
from Erwin Kim...
Lakewood High.
Mr. Kim, would you like to say something about the film?
Come on.
Thank you for coming.
Hopefully you will find this...
My...
Take this however.
Thank you.
Here he comes over.
Mr. Kim's film.
Once on a planet called Saturn Not...
on Alien Planet High School.
Beware.
Was there an alien teenager
who had fallen in love.
<B> Girl rescued. </ B>
Too late.
Pool Party.
Erwin.
It...
So far do not want to go again. He was okay.
- It was crazy. Really.
Thank you.
I got him.
I know I'm her.
But I already know how great you are.
You're so wonderful.
You're the best person I know.
What?
What is it?
The film was not about you.
Damn.
I thought because of her and
the gift of shoes that...
I'm one of those people who thinks
that everything revolves around them.
I made a joke.
I take the mickey.
I had invented.
Acorn.
- Yes.
That felt pretty good.
You were nervous once.
And I'm just here to smell
good to the flowers.
I hate you so much.
Do you have time to meet?
Yes, that's possible. I've
cleared my schedule for you.
Beautiful. Come on.
Anything people say hello.
Guest. You've done so well.
Guys, this is Nadine.
How are you?
- Good. And with you?
Fine, thank you.
That was so nice.
I just can not stop.
It was amazing.
