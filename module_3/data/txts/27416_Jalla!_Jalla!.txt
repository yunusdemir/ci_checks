Ouch!
Damn!
There's shit everywhere.
Roro... Roro!
- What?
- Can you pick up the shit here?
- That's your patch.
- I've had ten piIes, you've had none.
Yesterday I had at Ieast twenty,
you didn't heIp me then.
- I guess I had my own.
- Shut up and get on with it.
He can't hear you, he's deaf.
- AII right?
- Yeah, fine.
- What?
- I feeI so great when I'm near you.
You're surrounded by positive energy.
I get aII funny when I'm cIose to you.
SeriousIy! When I stand over here,
I'm compIeteIy coId - no feeIings.
Next to you, it's aImost too much.
Here, touch my arm...
Can you feeI the goose bumps?
Do it properIy.
Put your hands here...
- FeeI it?
- Yes, I do.
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm in Iove.
Too bad, 'cause I'm not
in Iove with you any more.
- Get up, I've got a customer.
- No, I'm dead.
A tin of snuff.
We haven't met, but I Iive upstairs.
I'm having some peopIe over tonight
and as I was making coffee,
I ran out.
- CouId I borrow some?
- Yeah, sure.
- I'II return it tomorrow.
- Don't worry.
- Here you are. Is that enough?
- That's fine.
- Do you need anything eIse?
- No, I just...
- Want to come in for a fuck?
- What, now?
Yeah.
Sure, that'd be reaIIy great.
Come on, then.
Hang on.
- Wait, wait...
- It's on the side, not inside.
What do you mean, ''on the side''?
Grab hoId of...
Try to... Watch your naiIs, damn it!
- You've got to reIax.
- I am reIaxed, it's not that.
- Come up a bit.
- I'II try to foId it in...
Shit!
- It's stiII on the side.
- Forget it, it's no use.
- I don't get it.
- It's because you're too tense.
- It's no use.
- I'm sure it'II sort itseIf out.
It's not going to ''sort itseIf out''.
I'm sure it's temporary.
It's been Iike this for weeks.
Shit!
- I don't get it, it's paraIysed.
- Mans...
- Why don't we have another go?
- No.
I can be the neighbour this time.
I don't get this neighbour game.
And you said ''fuck''
straight away.
No, first I went to get the coffee
and then I said it.
Yeah, but it went too fast to...
Forget it.
Faster! Do it now!
- It's right there.
- I missed it!
- Stupid TV. Come here.
- Crap game!
No, Ieave it.
I've got to check who it is.
It's my dad...
- Where are you?
- I'm on my way home.
I'm at a friend's, I'II be right there.
Hurry up!
- Is that a girI?
- Yes, more!

- No, it's Mans.
- Just come home!
- <i>l'm on my way.</i>
- I have to go.
- You're Ieaving, just Iike that?
You're not a chiId, Roro.
You're a grown man.
How Iong have we been together?
You daren't even teII them about me.
- Isn't it time you cut the cord?
- You know what they're Iike.
I suppose you're ashamed of me.
AbsoIuteIy not.
No, not untiI I've met your parents.
You can't.
Why not? You've met my parents.
- They're not...
- I know, it's different.
I want to meet your parents,
that's aII.
- Okay, you'II see them. Soon.
- When is soon?
- Not tomorrow, but soon.
- Tomorrow?
When can I meet your parents?
Tomorrow?
- Do they have a dick?
- Ducks? No, there's just two hoIes.
- Two hoIes. So how do they do it?
- What, how do they screw?
They put one hoIe against the other
and vibrate.
I saw it on a nature programme.
- There's got to be some kind of stick.
- It's not a car.
- So they don't have a dick?
- Nope.
- Sounds good, actuaIIy.
- Good?
Nothing.
- CaroIine! Come in and eat!
- I don't want to.
- Come in right now!
- No!
Hi, guys!
Come in and eat, Roro!
Why's your grandma aIways here?
Does she Iive with you?
She's afraid of being aIone,
she thinks she'II...
- Throw the rubbish away.
- Why throw it on my head?
It just happened.
Throw it away.
Howdy, Nisse.
AII right?
I taught him something...
Nisse, say <i>baddi nikak.</i>
<i>Baddi nikak...</i>
It means ''fuck you''.
Nisse, say <i>kol chara.</i>
- And that means ''fuck your famiIy''?
- No, ''eat shit''.
- He's reaIIy cooI.
- Very cooI... You and your Arab bird!
- I can teII you're reIated.
- It's a Lebanese bird, not Arab.
You have to say ''warning''
before hitting.
Warning - yourseIf!
- HeIIo, Mans.
- HeIIo, Grandma.
- WeII?
- I'm weII.
- And how are you?
- WeII.
- Roro, I've caIIed Yasmin.
- Which Yasmin?
She's a very nice girI
that I've found for you.
- Stop it, I don't want to get married.
- We want you to get married.
- PIease, I don't want to.
- You are getting married.
- I don't want to.
- I spoke to her on the teIephone.
- She's coming to see you.
- Leave me aIone.
Why? You are to marry
and have four chiIdren.
- Everybody wiII be happy.
- I'II marry when I'm fifty.
- Fifty! Then what'II be Ieft of you?
- Just Ieave me aIone.

Then you can marry!

It's handpainted. Very nice.
And this - goId.
- How much?
- Fifty kronor. Very cheap.
- That's a bit expensive, I think.
- Expensive?
- Forty-five?
- Twenty.
Twenty! No way I take twenty.
This one twenty,
the one with the birds.
No, I want this.
But fifty's too much.
Forty-five and it's yours.
- Forty.
- Forty? Okay, take it.
- Forty kronor!
- Easy, there's more.
No, no. Not forty, I can't.
- Fifty.
- It's oId.

Sixty! What did I teII you?
Dad!

- How's your beIIy, is it growing?
It's fine - I keep my money here.
Want to try?
Want to try again?
Come here!
I have to get back to work.
- Come and work here, with me.
- No.
I taIk to Yasmin and her brother.
They want to meet us.
I don't want to meet her.
I've toId you, I don't Iike it.
You have to get married.
- I wiII, but not to her.
- Why?
- I don't want to.
- Why not?
- I have to go to work. We'II taIk Iater
- You aIways say, ''I don't want to.''
- Why?
- I'm going to work.
Nice weather.
Mans, have you got any toothpaste?
Hey, Benson...
It's for him.
- What's up? You Iook a bit down.
- I'm just....
You've been Iike this
for a few days. What's up?
It's just...
- Promise you won't say anything?
- Of course.
- Promise?
- Cut it out. What is it?
Not in here.
What are you doing?
- What's up?
- It's crazy, man. I don't know...
Has it ever happened to you...
Like, when you and Lisa are...
You know, if you're drunk
and want to shag someone...
It can be difficuIt to get it up,
'cause... You know what I mean.
- Can't you get your dick up?
- No.
What, it's just hanging there?
More Iike...
Imagine you have a Iong baIIoon
and you fiII it with water.
It gets compIeteIy fiIIed up
and it's reaIIy...
But it's Iike it's too heavy,
it just hangs there.
- AII Iimp?
- Yeah.
- Have you had it checked out?
- Shit, not a doctor...
That's Iike going to the hospitaI.
- You've got to get it checked up.
- I know, but it feeIs...
Don't teII anyone.
- Of course not.
- Promise?
- Sure.
- Just be yourseIf and it'II be fine.
- It's cooI, Roro.
Ready?
- Roro... it's cooI.
- I'm cooI.
I'II just go and check it out.
I can't just waIk in and say, ''Hey, this

- Be quick.
- I'II be right back.
Don't disappear.
Hi, Roro. Come and meet Yasmin
and her brother.
- Hi, Roro. It's been a Iong time.
- Hi.
This is PauI and Yasmin.
- Hi, I'm PauI.
- Yasmin.
I have to go down

I'II be right back.

- Sometimes he cycIes.

- Today, aII young peopIe drive.
I'II buy a nice car.
You can't come up right now.
- You can't.
- You promised.
The house is fuII of reIatives.
I didn't know.
- Then I'II meet them, too.
- You can't.
- It's Grandma, and Auntie and...
- You're aIways making excuses!
Lisa, wait. Lisa!
- PIease?
- Lisa, wait!
I'm going to bed.
Listen...
Do you think you shouId
see a doctor?
They shove wooden sticks this Iong
up the urethra, you know.
- If you Iike, I'II come with you.
- I don't want to go.
- I've got Iots of money.
- So do I.
I own a restaurant.
I make a ton of money.
Bring the famiIy. I'II buy you aII
dinner, and we can sit and taIk.
- Yasmin can sing to us.
- She can sing?
- Sing to us, Yasmin!
- Perhaps she's shy.
- Don't be shy, it's your famiIy soon.
- It's fine. Maybe next time.
- Why are you sitting here?
- Go for a waIk.
Roro, take Yasmin some pIace.
- Here, I'II give you some money.
- No, he's got money.
You seem to be a reaIIy nice girI,
but I don't want to get married.
Neither do I ! It's my brother
who's brought me here.
I got a bit confused up there.
PauI!
Grandma and Dad are constantIy
going on about me getting married.
- It's worse for me.
- Why?
My parents Iive in Lebanon.
They've toId my brother
I have to marry before summer's over,
or I have to return to Lebanon.
- Why?
- They don't want me to be unmarried.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Why don't we marry?
We couId <i>say</i> we'II marry.
- I don't want to, I've got a...
- I don't want to either.
We <i>say</i> we'II marry,
then we change our minds.
I don't get it - neither of us wants to
get married, so why teII them we wiII?
It'II buy me time to find a soIution.
It'd be nice not to have
Grandma and Dad nagging me...
I don't know, though...
- Your brother can't force you.
- Yes, he can.
Nobody wiII need to know.
Back so soon?
You can waIk more!
- We don't need to.
- It's okay.
I think we've decided
that it couId work.
- We'II marry.
- Pardon?
- We wiII get married.
- That's great!
CongratuIations!
It's my turn. You've hit three baIIs.
I've onIy hit two.
Go on, then.
Okay, watch me.

And it's right on top of my restaurant.
You can eat there whenever!
It's a good-sized fIat.

You're going on the cake.

<i>Dinner's ready!</i>
Coming!
What are you doing?
Eh... I'm taking a crap.
Howdy! Name's Simon Pramsten.
I seII this state-of-the-art
vacuum cIeaner.
Your neighbour bought one.
If I couId come in for a moment,
I can demonstrate the new fan
which supersedes aII other modeIs.
The fan system incorporates
this compIeteIy new type of fiIter.
Have a Iook.
Here you are, Mum.
FeeI it.
What is it?
Is it a car or a tape recorder?
It's a vacuum cIeaner.
But it's so smaII.
She says it's smaII,
maybe not cIean good.
It's compact, but that's it's strength.
It's Iike a smaII buII.
The NationaI Testing Institute
has carried out research
which shows that our vacuum cIeaner
sucks the hardest of aII.
If you Iike, I can demonstrate.
Go ahead.
HeIIo... Who's he?
A saIesman. He's Ieaving
when he's finished cIeaning.
HeIIo. Simon Pramsten. I seII
vacuum cIeaners. I was just...
- Have you been with Yasmin?
- Yes.
- It's time to marry.
- What's the hurry? We just met.
Time's short.
- I hardIy know her. Take it easy.
- We can't.
- Can't we wait a bit?
- No.
Give me a break!
Leave him aIone now.
I'II taIk to him Iater.
- ShaII I continue?
- Yes, pIease continue.
It's aII they taIk about, it's too much.
And PauI's the worst of them aII.
- Who's PauI?
- Her brother. He's constantIy at us.
- Say you don't want to.
- It's not that simpIe.
I've got the whoIe famiIy on my back.
It's too much!
- Have you toId Lisa yet?
- No.
- Why not?
- I can't teII Lisa about it.
- How's it going with...?
- No change.
If you want to, I know someone...
I've a reIative who's into
aIternative medicine.
- What aIternative medicine?
- Different things.
- He's the Voodoo Man.
- Have I got an eviI spirit in my dick?
I know him a bit, he's
not <i>that</i> strange. It couId work.
ShaII I caII him?
I'II caII him.
I was thinking - what if you've
become a fag?
- What?
- Maybe you're a fag.
Come off it... !
You couId wake up one morning
and be a fag.
And you caII yourseIf my friend!
I'm your friend, it's got nothing to do
with that... It was just a thought.
- HeIIo, how are you?
- Very weII.
- Who is that?
- The friend I toId you about.
- That's the Iong and short of it.
- How Iong has it been going on?
- How Iong has it been Iike this?
- Two or three weeks, maybe four.
- About three or four weeks.
- Strange.
He thinks it's strange.
Has he been to a doctor?
He asks if you've seen a doctor.
- No.
- No, he hasn't.
- Then he's become a fag.
- He says it's strange.
- Can I examine him?
- He's going to examine you.
Whatever! You're the doctor.
I'm just going to have a Iook at you.
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to make you
some medicine.
You'II be aII right.
Do I twist to the Ieft or right?
Left or right?
First two turns to the right,
then two to the Ieft.
You're supposed to juggIe
with your baIIs.
- Do Iike this on him.
- The stick isn't right.
- HoId the stick straight.
- Shut your eyes and hoId this straight.
I've got some ideas about furniture.
Look at this bed!
- Are you buying a bed?
- It's for you, for the fIat!
It doesn't have to be one of those,
we can get whatever you Iike...
- Connect the hi-fi and everything.
- Sounds good.
- And I've booked the priest.
- The priest can wait. We just met.
We may as weII get it over with.
I've seen the cake, it's briIIiant!
Let's go.
See you.
Take the car, go for a ride.
CarefuI, though.
I've just waxed it.
You've got to taIk to PauI. It's going
too far - the fIat and the furniture.
I know, I don't understand how he's
managed it aII. I'II try again.
- TaIk to him.
- I've tried, but he won't Iisten.
We're supposed to fake it, but he's got
a priest, a party and everything.
I'II taIk to him.
- TaIk to him properIy.
- I wiII, I wiII.
I'm seeing Lisa, so you'd better
take the car keys.
- But I can't go up there aIone.
- You can't?
- I can't go up there with the keys.
- Can I give you a Iift somewhere?
This is what we'II do
- we'II go and get Lisa...
You can be my cousin.
- My cousin.
- Your cousin.
- But you've got to taIk to PauI.
- I wiII.
- Don't forget - you're my cousin.
- I'm your cousin.
- Dogs aren't aIIowed in here.
- Piss off!
Get that dog away from here!
He's not dangerous.
Screw you, bitch!
Hey, you! Come over here!
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.
Be a paI and Iook after my dog,
the bitch won't Iet him in.
I'II onIy be five minutes.
CarefuI!
- Do I hoId him Iike this?
- HoId his paws. Good.
Ever had a dog?
I can teII...
That's it!
You'II be aII right now, Rambo.
- His name is Rambo?
- Yeah. CooI, eh?
Take good care of him.
Anyone bothers you, say ''bark''.
They'II shit themseIves...
Okay, I'm counting on you now.
- What are you doing?
- Adjusting him.
Adjusting him? Just hoId him

CarefuI with his paws.

Shit, Iook at those baIIs... !
Rambo! Rambo, stop!
Fuck!
I'II kiII the son of a bitch!
Shit!
He's a friend.

- Fine.
- Where've you been?
- Around.
- This is Yasmin.
- Hi, I'm Mans.
We're on our way to get Lisa, maybe
go some pIace. Want to come?
- What car is that?
- It's my cousin's. Her name's Yasmin.
Mans is there, too.
I thought we'd go some pIace.
- I didn't know you had a girI cousin.
- She's aII right.
This is Lisa.
So you're Roro's cousin?
- Funny we've never met.
- Yes, weII you know...
- Do you Iive in town?
- Yes.
- Is it true you're marrying Roro?
- Who says?
He mentioned it at work,
but I wasn't sure.
They think so. His famiIy
and my famiIy, they aII think so.
Why can't you just say
that you don't want to?
- It's not that simpIe.
- What couId happen?
My famiIy wouId freeze me out,
and I'd be sent back to Lebanon.
- Shit... For reaI?
- For reaI.
- Just Iike that, ''bye-bye''?
- Yeah.
That's crazy.
It's aImost Iike on one of those
minority TV shows.
Isn't there someone eIse
you can marry?
Look at him, he's so skinny.
- He's nothing but a skeIeton.
- You're so mean!
- But there must be others.
- There are.
So you're in demand, then?
- Come on now...
- Guys come to the house to propose.
Do they - how many?
One or two, or...

You must've had a dick once.
ShaII I teII you about my dick?
There was a time when my dick

I'd stand and Iook at it

- It wasn't me, it was them.
- Don't fight next time.
- I don't know them, they foIIowed us!
You have to get married
and have a famiIy.
You can't go on Iike this.
AII my brothers are grandfathers.

- Dad, pIease...
I don't Iike Yasmin. She's very nice,
but I'm not in Iove with her.
- Why not?
- Because I'm not.

I'm not Iike you, I want Iove.
It's aII you youngsters taIk about
- Iove, Iove, Iove.
I just don't get it.

Your nose is bIeeding.

- At a caf, in town.
CarefuI.
Now put your head Iike this.
No, come and Iie here.
Watch my neck.

You've got some bIack goo there.
It's a fIy.

- He was bIeeding, so I...
- Go to the car.

Fucking pussy!

What's your probIem?
Dickhead!
Don't think you're getting away.
You're marrying my sister!

You just piss on me!
I work my butt off for you.
I get a function room, furniture,

Do I get a ''thank you, that's
reaIIy nice, PauI''? No, I get zero!
You're marrying my sister.
You're not going to ruin it, asshoIe!
- Don't caII me asshoIe.
- I'II caII you what I want, asshoIe!
Shut up! I don't want to hear
a word from you!
Who do you think you are?
You can't push me around!
I'm not Iistening to you! I said I'd
marry your sister as a favour.
You're just going on about
your damn restaurant and shit!
I'm sorry, Yasmin. I've tried,
but he's too much!
You get married, if it's so important,
because I'm not.
Go sit on your fucking cake,
if that'II make you happy!
You think you're so smart, don't you?
I've taIked to that whore
of yours, Lisa!
I've toId her everything.
She knows you're getting married.
- Don't caII her a whore!
- I'II caII her what I want!
You're a piIe of shit,
and you're getting married!
You just run to your IittIe whore,
but then you're getting married!
Lisa!
Open up, I've got to taIk to you.

HeII!

There's a Iot of furniture
underneath your baIcony.
- I dropped them by mistake.
- ReaIIy... How?
WeII, I was rearranging
the furniture,
when I tripped on a Iedge
and feII over.
- Out onto the baIcony?
- Yeah, right.
With a chest of drawers, a TV
and a fish tank?
Okay, seriousIy...
It aII started with my dick.
Pardon...? Who's Dick?
No, the dick is my penis.
- Dick - penis, my penis.
- Your penis?
''P-e-n-i-s.''
You see, about three
or four weeks ago...
I swear, my girIfriend Iives there.
I didn't have my keys.
Come on, caII her and ask.
Your shoes.
I'm teIIing you, my girIfriend
Iives there.
Your watch.
- Your beIt.

The chain.
How Iong do I have to stay here?
Picture it - a poIiceman
without a dick.
PeopIe Iooked at you and you knew
they were thinking,
''There's the dick-Iess poIiceman.''
I know I overreacted, but I just
Iost controI. You know...
I feeI sorry for you.
But as you've been booked,
you have to stay overnight.
- But I won't press charges.
- Thanks.
But that's between the two of us.
That's it then... And good Iuck.
How did you get in here?
I know one of the officers,
he Iet me in.
No, sit.

Funny, I was just thinking about you.

<i>Shut it, l'm trying to sleep!</i>

Shut up in there!
Go to bed!
