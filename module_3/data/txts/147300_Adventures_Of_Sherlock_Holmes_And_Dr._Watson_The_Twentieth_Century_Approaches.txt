- Mr. Victor Hatherley?
- Yes.
- Hydraulic engineer?
- Yes.
Colonel Lysander Stark.
Thank you for your responding
on such short notice.
You have been
recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley,
as being a man who is discreet
and capable of keeping a secret.
May I ask who it was
who gave me so good a recommendation?
Perhaps it's better that I should not
tell you that just now.
I have a proposition for you.
But absolute secrecy is quite
essential - absolute secrecy.
Do you promise?
If I promise to keep a secret,
you may absolutely depend
upon my doing so.
How would fifty guineas
for a night's work suit you?
Quite.
I said a night's work,
but an hour's
would be nearer the mark.
I simply want your opinion
about a hydraulic stamping machine
which has got broken.
If you can just detect the
cause of it
we could fix it ourselves.
Our little place
is quite out in the country.
It is a good
seven miles from Eyford Station.
Then I can't make it to the
last train.
I'll have to stay overnight.
Yes.
That's why we offer such a
generous pay
to you, a young and unknown,
when we could have hired
the best experts.
It's a lot of money, of course.
I should like, however,
to understand a little more clearly
what it is that you wish me to do.
I suppose you are aware
that fuller's-earth
is a valuable product,
and that it is only found in one or
two places in England.
I have heard about it.
Some time ago
I bought a small piece of land
Where a deposit of fuller's-earth
was discovered.
It turned out to be a link
between two much larger deposits
to the right and left,
both of them, however,happen to
be on my neighbour's lands.
A couple of my friends suggested that we
should quietly and secretly work
on our own little deposit
so we'd make enough money
to buy the neighbouring fields.
We guard our secret very jealously.
If anybody finds out that we hired
a hydraulic engineer
it would soon lead to inquiries,
and then,any chance of carrying
out our plans would be lost.
I hope that I make it all plain
enough?
The only point which I
could not quite understand
was what use you could make
of a hydraulic press
in excavating fuller's-earth,
which, as I understand,
is dug out like gravel from a pit.
We have our own process.
We compress the fuller's-earth
into bricks,
so as to remove them
without revealing what they really are.
Wait in this room for a few minutes,
please.
I won't be long.
You have no business being here.
I'm leaving, and so should you.
Go! Right now!
For the love of God! Get away
from here before it is too late!
Perhaps we had better
get down to business.
Mr. Ferguson
is my secretary and manager.
We will take you up
to see the machine.
You dig fuller's-earth here,
in the house?
- In the house?
- No, no!
We only compress it here.
We just want you to examine
the machine
and to let us know
what is wrong with it.
Ferguson, take the lamp.
This is the inside of the press.
The ceiling of this small chamber
is the end of the descending piston,
and it comes down
with the force of many tons
upon this metal floor.
Dear Ferguson, I believe,
the young man is familiar with the
workings of the hydraulic press.
The machine still works, but there
seems to be  some trouble
that prevents it from working
in its full capacity.
There was a small leakage.
One of the rubber
bands had shrunk.
It happened because
of this small thing?
This caused the problem.
How can we fix it?
We can order it from London.
It has to be replaced.
What are you doing there?
I was admiring your fuller's-earth.
I think I'd be able
to advise you better
if I knew the exact purpose
for which yor press was used.
Very well.
You shall know
all about it.
Hello! Colonel! Let me out!
I swear, I'll tell no one!
Colonel!
I saw nothing!
I beg you, Colonel!
You misunderstood me!
Colonel! Let me out!
Colonel! Let me out!
Come! come!
They will be here in a moment.
They will see
that you are not there.
Come!
Come! Come!
Here is the window.
It is high, but that's your only
chance.
Helga!
Helga!
- Good morning, Mrs. Watson!
- Good morning!
I brought a patient
to the doctor.
- Good morning!
- Hello!
- Come in, please!
- Thank you!
- Good bye!
- Good bye!
Good bye. Thank you.
Good bye!
John!
John!
John!
John, you've got another patient!
The beginning of the 20th century
was marked for the British
with the war
and Queen Victoria's death.
This is when the old England
ceased to exist.
Scotland Yard policemen
and London criminals
have armed themselves
with electricity, telephones,
automobiles and airplanes,
and went about their business
in the new century.
Sherlock Holmes who considered himself
too old-fashioned for the new era,
retired and left London for
the small farm at Sussex.
Doctor Watson concentrated
on his the medical practice.
That was the end of
THE ADVENTURES
OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON
By Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
Sherlock Holmes
VASILIY LIVANOV
Dr. Watson
VITALIY SOLOMIN
The Twentieth Century Begins
Part One
We haven't seen each other
since your return
from your American trip.
That's right!
- Watson!
- Holmes!
I can't get used
to your beard.
I, my friend, can't get used
to the fact
that the telegram
about your arrival
comes 30 minutes before you show up.
I can't get ready to meet you.
And I don't know
whom I should blame:
the slow work of the post office
or the speed of your car.
Come on in!
Relax, my friend, you've had a
long trip.
I see you have been to
Turkish baths.
My rheumatism has been acting up
these last few days.
A Turkish bath is what we call
an alterative medicine--
But, damn!
- How did you manage to find that out?
- It's elementary, Watson!
You are in the habit of tying
your boot laces in a certain way.
Today you tied them
with an elaborate double bow,
which is not your usual method.
This is what I thought:
You have, therefore,taken them off
somewhere. Who has tied them?
It is unlikely that it is your wife
or the boot repair man,
since your boots are brand new.
Well, what's left? The bath boy.
Yes, Holmes,
I wanted to tell you a story,
which I heard from a patient of
mine.
Excuse me.
I have to leave you,
Watson, for a while.
My neighbor,
mister Von Bork has arrived.
He usually buys honey from me.
How much honey do you want?
Two pounds.
The radiator that you
gave me last time
was a perfect match.
Now I need an oil pump
and the filters.
I need to go to London for that.
I have already called for
my friend with a car.
- He's a mechanic, too?
- Of course, he is.
- Is that his car outside?
- It is.
Here is your honey.
- How much?
- Never mind.
- No, really?
- Three shillings.
Just a minute!
It seems I only have bills.
- No, I found two coins.
- It's enough for me.
No, here is the third one.
Goodbye.
Why did you tell him
that I am a mechanic?
If I had told him
you are Doctor Watson,
he would have asked
thousands of questions.
You are a popular writer,
my friend.
Then I would have had to
tell him my real name.
But I prefer
to be known as
a beekeeper here.
But what do a pump and
filters have to do with it?
It's just a favor for a good
neighbor.
By the way, Watson,
have you ever seen a fake shilling?
Von Bork just paid with it.
Why didn't you give it back
if you knew it was fake?
I didn't want to upset a good man.
What a beautiful thing!
I can't spot any difference
between this and that the sort
of His Majesty George the Fifth produces.
Except one thing.
It's a counterfeit.
It's such a pity, Holmes
that you abandoned your fight
against the criminal world
of London, and left it for Scotland
Yard to deal with.
You know, by the way,
Lestrade has retired.
Yes, I heard about it.
So here is the story
which my patient told me.
He is a young and handsome
hydraulic engineer,
who lost his left thumb under
some dramatic circumstances.
Excuse me.
Yes, sir?
When did
this beautiful house burn down?
Four days ago, sir.
Here is the house
where you were, Mr Hatherley.
This one? No, that house was
several miles away from the station.
When we were getting into the car,
it was very clean.
And when we finally arrived,
it was quite dirty.
I noticed that.
Of course, it was clean before.
It became dirty after 30 minutes
of driving through potholes
around this house.
Why didn't you tell me
that this house had burnt down?
I didn't know it had.
Well, it's interesting.
It was your oil lamp
which, when it was crushed inside the
press, set fire to the wooden walls,
and they were too distracted by
the chase to notice.
Here it is.
"Krupp. Dresden".
I think they have used the machine
to make something covered with
amalgam,
which you said looked like silver.
What could it be?
There was a cart here.
They loaded boxes.
Heavy ones.
About 250 pounds each.
Three men worked here.
A carthorse.
My old friend!
An well made
fake shilling.
We don't understand you, Mycroft.
I made it through 42 minutes.
This is enough to survive
the gas attack.
Your participation in this
case
and it's excellent outcome
was well-timed.
Why do you think
there was an excellent outcome?
A missing link in the chain of
pieces of evidence was found.
German empire
is producing a counterfeit currency
in Great Britain.
There are many exhibits like this
in the State Treasury
already.
Now we can without any hesitation
give an order
to start producing counterfeit
currency in Germany.
In order to balance the warp
in our economy,
by causing a warp in the German
economy.
Maybe Hatherley was wrong
thinking that the counterfeiter
was German?
That's right.
Holmes is speaking.
As admiral County informed us,
the Siam population this spring was
3 million 220 thousand 76 people.
At the stable annual increase
of the population, which is 3.216%,
I calculated roughly
that by today
the increase of the population
has been 42 thousand 250 or 260 people.
Bernard, it's OK.
254.
Hello, Sherlock, hello, my boy.
We do not know anything yet,
but you are already drawing conclusions
concerning our foreign policy.
I shall invite our Prime Minister
here
Lord Bellinger.
So that your friend and you...
Hello, Watson!
Could read a classified letter,
which we received yesterday.
Just a minute!
He answers.
The letter has disappeared.
It is too early for you to retire.
The destiny of your country
depends on it.
You must meet the Prime Minister.
In private.
Police cannot be involved.
Where can you meet him?
Baker street, 221 B.
A little piece of brotherly advice
to you, Sherlock.
Since you are going to deal
with politicians,not criminals,
trust no one.
Not a single word!
My brother Mycroft
is the most indispensable man
in the country.
You can never be sure whether
he just works for the government
or that he IS the British government.
But what about the king?
Neither him,nor his late
grandmother,Queen Victoria
took a step
without Mycroft Holmes'advice.
Good afternoon, gentlemen!
How can I help you?
Good afternoon!
Good afternoon!
Can we come in?
Certainly!
Please, gentlemen!
We used to live in this house.
And today we have a meeting here.
Can we use the sitting room for this?
According to the wishes of the former
owner of this house, gentlemen,
this is the only room,
which wasn't sold over to our company.
Mrs. Hudson intended
to create a museum here
in the memory of a historical
person of the Good Old England
whom you gentlemen probably
know little about.
Holmes.
Oh yes, Mr Holmes.
That's the name.
We still receive letters,
addressed to him,
with requests and cries for help.
I assume, Mr Holmes
was a quite an
influential businessman, who--
- Excuse me, mister--
- Smith.
Very well, Mr Smith.
My friend and I
will stay here for a while
as the exhibits
of the future museum.
May I introduce my friend,
doctor Watson.
Nice to meet you,sir.
Please bring all the mail,
which was addressed to me.
Yes, sir.
It was when you were thought to
have perished in Switzerland
that Mrs. Hudson and I were
mourning over you
and she decided
to create your museum here.
Why only mine?
You are trying to keep yourself
out? No way.
You're an old smelly relic
just like me,Watson.
Lord Bellinger, the Prime Minister
of Great Britain
and Trelawney Hope, Secretary of
Foreign Affairs wish to see you,sir.
Shall I let them in?
- Please do.
- Yes, sir.
Mister Holmes?
Please.
Please.
Doctor Watson,
my friend and my colleague.
The document in question
is of such immense importance
that its publication might
very easily
lead to an international conflict.
Unless its recovery can be
attended with the utmost secrecy,
then it may as well not be
recovered at all,
due to the nature of the information
the letter contains.
Tell me exactly the circumstances
under which this document disappeared.
The letter was received six days ago.
It was of such importance
that I have never left it in my safe,
instead I have taken it home each evening
to my house in Whitehall Terrace,
and kept it in my bedroom
in a locked wooden case.
It was there last night.
Of that I am certain.
This morning it was gone.
Mister Holmes!
The wooden case was on the dressing
table,next to my bed all night.
I am a light sleeper,
and so is my wife.
We are both prepared to swear
that no one could have entered.
What time did you dine?
Half-past seven.
- When did you go to bed?
- It was half-past eleven.
My wife had gone to the theatre.
I waited for her.
It was half-past eleven
when we went to our bedroom.
Surely your wife knew
about this letter?
No, sir.
I had said nothing to my wife
until I found it missing this morning.
I have long known, sir, how great
your sense of public duty is.
I am convinced that in the case
of a such importance
your dedicaton to your work and
your country is beyond any doubt.
Now, sir, I must ask you
more particularly
what this document is,
and why its disappearance
should have
such momentous consequences?
Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long,
thin one of pale blue colour.
There is a seal of red wax
stamped with a crouching lion.
The address was
in large, bold handwriting.
I fear, sir, that as interesting and
indeed,important as these details are,
my inquiries are aimed at
the content of the document.
What was the letter about?
That is a classified information.
If by the aid of the powers
which you are said to possess
you can find envelope as
I described
with its contents,
you will have served
well for your country,
and will receive any reward
which lies
in my power to bestow.
I regret exceedingly that
I cannot help you in this matter,
and any continuation of
this meeting
would be a waste of time for
all parties involved.
I am not accustomed, sir--
I agree with you.
Allright, I will tell you,
relying entirely upon your honor
and that
of your colleague, Dr. Watson.
I appeal
to your patriotism, gentlemen.
You may trust us,sir.
The letter is from a certain
foreign monarch
who has been troubled by some recent
developments in our colonies.
It has been written in a heat
of the moment.
Inquiries have shown
that his ministers
know nothing of the matter.
The manner in which it was written
and certain phrases in it are of
so provocative a character,
that its publication would lead
to a public uproar in England.
Even more than that.
I'm confident that within a week
of the publication of the letter
our country may find itself
involved in a big war.
Yes. It was him.
Exactly.
It is this letter,
which may well mean
the loss of millions of pounds and the
lives of hundreds of thousands of men,
that has been lost
in this mysterious fashion.
As we speak
It is probably well
on its way
at a speed of a steamboat.
Now, Mr. Holmes,what course
of action do you recommend?
Let's consider the facts.
Most likely it was taken last
night,between seven thirty
and eleven thirty,
when the case wasn't watched.
Now, sir, if a document of such
importance was stolen this long ago,
where can it be by now?
It is, probably, beyond our
reach.
You think, sir, that unless
this document is recovered
there will be a war?
I think it is a very probable
outcome.
Then, sir, prepare for war.
Those are cruel words.
Should there be any fresh
developments
we shall communicate
with you, mister Holmes,
and you will no doubt let us
know
the results of your own
investigation.
The situation is desperate.
- Your mail, sir!
- Thank you, Smith.
Put it somewhere.
There are only three people capable
of playing so bold a game
They are Oberstein,
La Rothiere, and Eduardo Lucas.
I will have to see all three
of them.
Is it Eduardo Lucas
of Godolphin Street?
You won't see him.
- Why not?
- "Murder in Westminster".
Mr. Eduardo Lucas,
well known in society circles
on account of his charming personality,
was a single man,
thirty four years of age.
He had been stabbed to death.
The murder weapon
was a curved Indian dagger,
taken from a collection of
Oriental weapons
which adorned one of the house
walls.
It is an amazing coincidence.
A coincidence?
No, my dear Watson,
the two events are connected.
There's no doubt about it.
It is for us to find that
connection.
But now the police will
know everything.
They know all that
they see at Godolphin Street.
They know
nothing of the Whitehall Terrace.
Only we know of both events.
There is one obvious point
which would, in any case, made
Lucas a prime suspect.
Godolphin Street, Westminster,
is only a few minutes' walk
from the Whitehall Terrace.
The other secret agents
I have named
live at the far West End.
A small detail,
which may prove essential.
Mister Holmes!
A very attractive and noble lady
wishes to see you.
Who can it be?
Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope.
Good afternoon, gentlemen!
- Good afternoon, milady!
- Good afternoon!
Has my husband
been here, Mr. Holmes?
- Yes, madam. Have a seat, please.
- Thank you.
I implore you not to tell him
that I was here.
Your ladyship places me
in a very delicate position.
I cannot make
any unconditional promises.
Mr. Holmes,
I will speak frankly with you.
There is complete confidence between my
husband and me on all matters, save one.
That one is politics.
Now, I am aware that
there was a most deplorable occurrence
in our house last night.
I know
that a document has disappeared.
But because the matter has to
do with politics
my husband refuses to take me
into his complete confidence.
Now it is essential
that I should
thoroughly understand it.
You are the only other person,
besides these politicians,
who knows the truth.
I beg you, Mr. Holmes, to tell me
exactly what has happened
and what it may lead to.
Madam, what you ask of me
is impossible.
You must understand, madam.
If your husband thinks fit
to keep you
in the dark over this matter,
is it for us, who have only
learned the true facts
under the pledge
of secrecy,
to tell what he chose to withhold?
You can't ask that.
It is him whom you should ask.
I did.
You are my only hope.
But without your telling me
anything definite, Mr. Holmes,
you may do a great service if
you would enlighten me on one point.
What is it, madam?
Is my husband's political career likely
to suffer because of this incident?
Well, madam, unless the matter in
question is set right
it may certainly have
a very unfortunate effect.
What consequences?
Madam, once again you ask me
more than I can possibly answer.
Then I will take up
no more of your time.
I cannot blame you, Mr. Holmes,
for having refused
to speak more freely,
and I hope you Dr. Watson
will not
think badly of me
because of my desire,
even against my husband's will,
to try and help him.
Once more, I beg of you
to say nothing of my visit.
Now, Watson,
the fair sex is your department.
What do you make of this
lady's visit?
What did she really want?
Surely her intentions are clear.
Yes.
Her anxiety was very natural.
Remember
that she comes from a social
class of people
who know how to hide their
feelings.
She was extremely worried.
She tried to assure us
she acted in her husband's best
interests
so she should know everything.
What does it all mean?
Have you noticed, Watson, how she manoeuvred
to position herself away froom the light.
She did not wish us
to read her face expression.
I don't think it was intentional.
The motives of women are so hard
to decipher.
You remember
the woman at Margate
whom I suspected
for the same reason.
It turned out, she was worried she
forgot to apply makeup to her nose.
How can you build any logical
conclusions
on such a material?
Glad to see you
after such a long time.
- Hello!
- Hello!
Tell me, Lestrade, you are now
an honorable retiree.
How did you get involved
in this case?
I help out
my young colleague.
Meet Inspector Pitkin.
- What brings you here?
- I used to know the owner of this house,
and Doctor Watson and I
decided to have a look
at the crime scene.
Go ahead,then.
Inspector Pitkin, report properly
what we have found here.
Properly!
Eduardo Lucas
was a remarkable linguist
and a writer.
He was a keen student of international
politics,intrigues and gossip,
which is demonstrated in his papers,
that were carefully examined.
It also appears that
his relations with women have been
promiscuous but superficial,
His personal belongings seem
to remain in place.
None of the valuable possessions
have been taken.
Here is the photographic
portrait of Eduardo Lucas,
which we enlarged
in Scotland Yard
using a svetotype method.
In order to--
Now tell us about the lady's picture.
OK, here is the lady.
Mrs. Henry Furnier,
occupying a small villa in
the Rue Austerlitz, Paris.
The French police have discovered
that Mrs Henry Furnier has just
returned from her trip to London.
And now she is in confined to a
mental institution
She has developed a mania
of a dangerous and permanent form.
A comparison of photographs
has proved conclusively
that Mr. Henri Furnier and Eduardo Lucas
were the same person,
and that the deceased had lived a
double, and maybe even triple life
in London, Berlin and Paris.
He was killed by his wife
in an attack of jealousy,
but they cannot prosecute her
according to the article 12746
of the British law codex
as being mentally ill.
- Is that it?
- Yes.
It is a sure thing, Holmes.
How do you like our new generation
of detectives?
Please.
Everything is clear, as you can see.
She tracked him.
She knocked at the door.
He let her in,
couldn't keep her in the street.
The scene of jealousy was terrible.
She was so--
Everything was--
The chairs were thrown around
Lucas was probably holding a chair
up
He was kind of protecting himself.
And then she stabbed him
and Lukas falls on the carpet.
He must have lost a lot of blood.
Look, Watson.
That's odd.
You see that stain on the carpet?
Well, a great deal should have
seeped through, must it not?
How did that happen, Watson?
How did that happen, inspector?
How did that happen, Pitkin?
We didn't touch anything here.
When the body was discovered
we were very careful
to keep things in their position.
Officer in charge was
here day and night.
I am sure there is a logical
explanation for this.
I think, we'll find the stain.
We'll find it? Where?
Here it is.
If we put the carpet this way
the stains lie above each other.
Who moved the carpet, and why?
Tell me, Inspector,
that constable in the corridor
has been present
here the whole time?
- Yes!
- Yes.
Well, take my advice.
Interrogate him carefully.
You'll be more likely to get a
confession out of him one on one.
Ask him how he dared
to allow somebody inside here.
Tell him you know someone
has been here. Press him.
Tell him that a full confession
is his only chance for forgiveness.
I'll get it out of him!
Pitkin, follow me!
Watson, close the door! Hurry!
It's empty.
He confessed.
McPherson,let these gentlemen hear
of your most inexcusable conduct.
I meant no harm, sir,
I assure you.
A young lady came
around here last evening.
Mistook the house, she said.
And then we started talking.
You get bored when you're on duty
here all day.
She just wanted to see
where the crime was commited.
Had read about it
in the papers, she said.
She was a very respectable,
well-spoken young woman,
and I saw no harm
in letting her have a peep.
When she saw that blood stain
on the carpet,
she fainted and fell on the floor.
I ran to the back to get her some water,
but by the time I had returned,
the young woman was gone.
Let it be a lesson to you,
Mcpherson
that you can't deceive your
superiors.
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
We wish to see
Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope.
Mr Holmes
This is most unfair
of you.
I wished, as I have explained,
to keep my visit to you a secret.
Or maybe you, Doctor Watson,
are intending to study
the life of the high society,
and then write about it
in your stories.
- I'm sorry, madam, but--
- Unfortunately, madam,
I had no other alternative.
I have been commissioned
to recover
this immensely important document.
I must therefore ask you, madam,
to hand it to me.
You're insulting me, Mr. Holmes.
Come, come, madam,
it is of no use.
Give up the letter,please.
- The butler shall show you out.
- Madam!
If you ring, then all my earnest efforts
to avoid a scandal will be wasted.
Give up the letter
and all will be set right.
If you tell me the truth,
I may be able to help you.
Otherwise, I'll have to expose
you.
I'm sorry, madam.
You are trying to intimidate me.
It is very unbecoming,
gentlemen,
to come here
and treat a lady in this manner.
I know of your visit to Eduardo Lucas,
of your giving him this document,
of your return
to his house last night,
and the ruse you used
to retrieve the letter from
the hiding place under the carpet.
You will feel much better if
you sit down.
- You are mad, Mr. Holmes.
- Sit down, madam.
He will not speak
until you sit down.
- I am telling you this as a doctor.
- Thank you.
The policeman has recognized you.
I insist,
that you are under
some absurd illusion.
Is Mr. Trelawney Hope at home?
He is expected, sir,
any minute now.
Very well.
We shall wait.
Oh, spare me, Mr. Holmes!
Spare me!
Don't tell him!
Give me the letter.
It is there.
Here it is.
I wish to Heaven
I had never seen it!
Well.
How can we return it?
Elementary,Holmes
We need to put it back
in the wooden case.
Simply brilliant.
Bravo, Watson!
- Where is the case?
- In the bedroom.
Quick, madam, bring it here!
I hope, Watson,
that you will never write
about this case,
where we didn't exactly
demonstrate quickness of wit.
You did,actually.
No, the circumstances
were always ahead of us.
We were like two rolling billiard
balls on our way to the pocket.
- How did you open it before?
- I took the key from my husband.
He didn't know about it, though.
That's not good.
- Do you have a hairpin?
- Yes.
Give it to me, please.
Here it is.
Sometimes, with just a hairpin
you can learn secrets of the state.
Please!
So, my friend, Doctor Watson decided
not to write any stories about you.
Maybe only poetry.
I have never written any poetry,
even when I was courting
Mrs. Watson.
You should have done that,
my friend.
I am very grateful to you,
mister Holmes.
How much do I owe you?
Lady Hilda,we are taking a big risk
covering up your conduct in the case.
As a reward,you must tell me
why you did that.
Eduardo Lucas pursued me
for a long time.
Ever since the time when my husband
was an envoy in Berlin.
I was careless enough to receive
him at my place on several occasions.
My husband knew him
very well, too.
The last favor
that I did for him in Germany
was purchasing
of some hydraulic press
in my name
which was somehow secretly sent
to England.
Several days ago
Lucas has come to London,
where we met at his insistence.
Lucas threatened to name me as
a German spy, disgrace me in public,
and publish all letters
we exchanged
unless I bring him a certain
document he described.
It was that letter.
Lucas assured me that no harm would
come to my husband as a result
and it would even reduce the tension
in my spouse's business affairs.
Put yourself in my position,
Mr. Holmes!
What was I to do?
Tell your husband everything.
I could not, Mr. Holmes, I could not!
So I committed a theft.
I used my husband's keys
to open the case,
stole the letter,
and took it to Godolphin Street.
What happened there, madam?
As he let me in ,
I left the door
open behind me,
for I feared
to be alone with the man.
I remember seeing a woman standing
outside the house as I entered.
I handed him the document.
Lucas gave me the documents,
concerning the purchase of the press
and our letters.
At this instant
there was a sound at the door.
I heard steps in the corridor.
Lucas quickly lifted the carpet,
and put the document into some
hiding place there
What happened after,
was like some nightmare.
I still remember a woman's face and
her voice, when she screamed in German:
"My waiting was not in vain.
At last, I have found you with her!"
I saw him with a chair in his hand,
a knife gleamed in hers.
I ran from the house,
and only next morning I learned
of the murder from the papers.
I was watching the Lucas place
for a while
thinking of ways to retrieve
the letter.
Last night I managed to get it
back.
You already know how it happened.
I brought it back with me,
and thought of destroying it...
Dear God, I hear my husband's
steps at the stairs!
Madam!
Mister Holmes!
Any news, Mr. Holmes?
Yes, and they're quite good.
Thank heaven!
The Prime Minister is having lunch
with us.
He has nerves of steel, and yet
I know that he has hardly slept
since this terrible event.
Jacobs, will you ask
the Prime Minister to come up?
Mr Holmes, Dr Watson,my wife
Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope.
I fear that this is
a matter of politics,darling.
We will join you
in a few minutes.
In the dining room.
- Mister Holmes!
- The Prime Minister of Great Britain,
sir Thomas Bellinger.
Sir,I have investigated the matter
at every possible angle,
and I came to believe
that there is absolutely
no reason to be worried.
But that is not enough,
Mr. Holmes.
We cannot live on the top of
a volcano.
Thank you.
We must know for certain.
Sit down, gentlemen.
The more I think of the case,
the more convinced I am
that the letter
has never left this house.
Mr. Holmes!
If it had, it would certainly
have been made public by now.
But why should anyone
steal it and then hide
it in the very same house?
I am not convinced
that anyone did steal it.
Then how could it
leave the case?
I am not convinced that it ever
did leave the case.
Gentlemen,this joking is
very ill-timed.
You have my assurance
that it's not in it.
Surely, it is easy to find out.
Let us have
the case brought in.
Jacobs!
Bring here my wooden case
from the bedroom.
This is a farcical waste of time,
but if nothing else will satisfy you,
it shall be done.
Have you examined
the case since then?
No. It was not necessary.
You could possibly
have overlooked it.
Who knows?
I presume,
there are other papers there.
- It may have got mixed with them.
- It was on the top.
Someone may have shaken
the case and displaced it.
No! No!
I have checked everything!
Thank you, Jacobs, put it here.
You may go.
Here it is, gentlemen.
And this is the key.
These are the papers,
as you see.
Letter from Lord Merrow.
Report from Sir Charles Hardy.
Memorandum from Belgrade.
Note on the Russian-German
grain taxes.
Letter from Madrid.
Note from Lord Flowers.
Good heavens!
What is this? Lord Bellinger!
This is the envelope.
And the letter is intact.
- Hope, I congratulate you.
- Thank you!
Thank you!
What a weight off my shoulders!
I always believed in you, Hope!
Where is my wife?
I must tell her that all is well.
Go ahead.
Hilda! Hilda!
Mister Holmes!
Are you absolutely sure
this letter never left the box?
I am sure
that this case is closed.
And I would never dare,
Prime Minister,
to waste your precious time
with tales
about my professional secrets.
Not only you, politicians,
have secrets.
We, detectives, have them, too.
Thank you,gentlemen.
The company of the royal field
engineers was here,
and they have installed
a portable telephone.
Here it is, Mr Holmes.
No mail during the last few days.
A young man
with a bandaged hand came by.
Here is his business card.
Hydraulic Engineer Victor Hatherley.
He brought you this newspaper,
and asked me to show you
these photographs
in the crime section,of
Mr. Lucas and Mrs. Furnier,
and asked me to tell you:
"It is them!"
That is all, Mr Holmes.
What would you like me to do next?
Bacon and eggs
for me and Doctor Watson.
- Yes, sir!
- And, Smith!
Yes?
Teach me how to use this thing.
I can do it. Go on, Smith,
We're very hungry.
Yes, sir!
Hold it!
The central.
The central!
Mycroft Holmes' residence, please.
They say that he is at the Palace.
The Palace, please.
Mycroft!
Mycroft!
The day has passed in vain.
Watson and I haven't had much to
do today.
No, the letter was in the case.
Hatherley found
the counterfeiters all by himself
in the "Sunday Times."
Doctor Watson and I,we cannot
go back to the good old days.
No, I am going back to the country.
I will come by your place to pick up
the oil pump and the filters
for my neighbor in Sussex.
Please, baron!
Missed!
As far as I can tell from
the recent trend of events,
you will probably be back
in Berlin within a week.
When you get there, my dear Von Bork,
I think you will be surprised
at the welcome
you will receive.
I happen to know what is thought
at the highest quarters
of your work in this country.
English are not very hard to
deceive.
It was a great idea,
my dear Von Bork,
to pose as a sportsman--
No, no, it's not a ruse at all.
I am a born sportsman.
Well, that makes it
even more effective.
I have even heard that you
practice boxing
with the young Eglish officers.
Wonderful.
As a result,nobody takes you
very seriously.
You are a 'good old sport,'
'quite a decent fellow
for a German.'
And this whole time this
quiet country house of yours
is the source of half the mischief
in England,
and the sporting squire
happens to be the best
secret agent in Europe.
You're a genius, my dear Von Bork,
a genius!
You flatter me, Baron.
Although I can certainly claim
that six years I spent in this
country have not been unproductive.
I've never shown you
my little stash.
Would you mind
stepping in for a moment?
Some of my papers have already been
transferred.
My wife took the less important
documents with her.
She and the household
left yesterday for Flissingham.
I count on the embassy
to guard the rest.
Your name has already been
added as a staff member.
Of course,you never know.
We may have to stay.
If England leaves
France to her fate.
We know for a fact
that there is no binding
treaty between them.
And Belgium?
Yes, and Belgium, too.
- But the country's pride?
- My dear Von Bork,
we live in a utilitarian age.
Everything can be bought and sold.
Honor is a medieval conception.
Besides, England is not ready.
I should think
they would be wiser
to fight with allies
rather than alone.
This week will decide the fate
of this country.
Look!
"The Channel",
"Forts", "Ireland".
"Submarines",
"Airplanes".
Wonderful!
And all in four years, Baron.
Not a bad show for the hard drinking
country squire with a penchant for hunting.
But the gem of my collection is
still on its way
and there is
the setting, all ready for it.
Naval Signals.
You have a very impressive dossier
here.
Outdated. Waste of paper.
The Admiralty somehow got wind
of the leak of information
and every code has been changed.
But!
Thanks to my cheque book
and the good old Altamont
all will be well tonight.
Please.
"All's well. I'm bringing the new
sparking plugs soon. Altamont."
Sparking plugs, huh?
You see,
he poses as a car mechanic
and I have a full garage here.
We created a code.
Everything likely to come up in a
report is named after some spare part.
If he talks
of a radiator, it is a "battleship",
an "oil pump" means
a cruiser, and so on.
"Sparking plugs" are naval signals.
They are useful, these traitors,
but I dread paying them
their 'thirty golden coins'.
He is not a traitor at all.
I assure you
that our most patriotic Germans
have nothing on this
Irish American
when it comes to how they feel
towards England.
So he's an Irish American?
Yes.
He is a touchy fellow
and needs humouring on occasion.
He can be quite difficult,
I assure you.
Alas, I have to go.
I need
to get back to London early.
How still
and peaceful it all seems.
This all may change
in a matter of one week.
If our contact comes up with
necessary information
The sky will look different,too.
Who is that?
That is Martha,our servant.
My wife
wanted to take her to Germany,
but I decided
to keep her here.
You did?
To me,she almost personifies Britain.
With her complete self-absorption and
general air of comfortable somnolence.
My dear Von Bork!
Having won the battle against
the greed and corruption
of the new representatives
of European high society,
Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson
saved the Great Britain from what
seemed to be an inevitable war -
the letter of the capricious monarch
found its way back into the box,
Holmes returned to his farm
in Sussex.
Watson returned to
to his patients.
The times of the Good Old England
faded from everybody's memory.
And so did...
THE ADVENTURES
OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON
By Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
Sherlock Holmes
VASILIY LIVANOV
Dr. Watson
VITALIY SOLOMIN
The Twentieth Century Begins
Part Two
Come in, Watson.
You have grown a beard again.
Stay away from the window draft.
Summer colds
are always a little trying.
How did you know?
Don't tell me it's my shoes
that gave me away again.
Of course, your shoes!
The letter
from your brother Mycroft.
Your boots are new. You could not
have had them more than a few weeks.
The wingtips from what I can
gather,
are slightly burned.
For a moment I thought
they might have got wet
and you burnt them while trying
to get them dry next to a fireplace.
But near the instep there is
a small circular wafer of paper
with the shop's
hieroglyphics upon it.
Moisture would, of course,
have removed it.
That could only mean hat you've been sitting
with your feet outstretched to the fire,
It hasn't been raining in a while
So you had a cold and were trying to keep
yourself warm next to the fireplace.
- Who is Arthur Cadogan West?
- I shall tell you on the way.
My neighbor Bork came
again for the honey.
How much do you need this time?
Only one pound.
Did you manage to get
sparking plugs?
There's been a bit of a snag.
A friend of mine promised me
to take me to London today,
and I am sure
we will get everything resolved.
One shilling.
- So cheap?
- It is a blue honey.
Plus there is a discount
for regular customers.
So who is Arthur Cadogan West?
He was a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.
His dead body was discovered on the
rails,but what train he was on
and where he was going,
we could not find out yet.
His ticket,
of course, would show that.
There was no ticket in his pockets.
No ticket!
Maybe they didn't find it?
The press printed a list
of his possessions.
His purse contained two pounds
in cash plus a cheque book,
through which his identity
was established.
There were also
two theater tickets.
and a small packet
of some technical documentation.
Well, let's start investigating!
It is a real crisis.
I have never seen
HIM so upset.
As for the Admiralty - it is buzzing
like an overturned beehive.
What were the technical papers?
The plans
of the Bruce-Partington submarine.
Surely you have heard of it?
- Bruce-Partington?
- Never.
Right!
It has been the most jealously
guarded of all government secrets.
Naval warfare becomes impossible
within the radius
of a Bruce-Partington's operation.
Two years ago a very large sum
was paid
in acquiring
the rights to the invention.
The plans,
which are exceedingly complex,
comprise some
thirty separate patents,
each essential to the working
of the whole system,
and are kept in an elaborate safe
in a confidential office
adjoining the arsenal.
If the chief constructor of the Navy
desired to consult them,
even he'd be forced to go in person
to the Woolwich office.
And suddenly we find these papers in
the pocket of a some dead junior clerk
at the heart of London.
From the official point of view
it's simply unacceptable.
But you have recovered them?
Ten papers were stolen
from the safe in Woolwich.
There were only seven
in Cadogan West's pocket.
The most essential three are gone.
Stolen, vanished.
Sherlock!
Forget everything else!
Never mind your usual
petty puzzles.
It's an international problem
of massive proportions
that you have to solve.
Why did
Cadogan West take the papers?
How did he die?
How did his body end up
where it was found?
Where are the missing documents?
He took the papers
to London to sell the secret,
intending, no doubt, to have
the plans back next morning
before they were found missing.
While in London, on this
mission of treason, he met his end.
He was going back to Woolwich when he was
killed and thrown out of the train car.
Lestrade can tell you more.
He represents Scotland Yard
in this investigation.
The most disturbing piece
of business, Sherlock.
This is
where the young man's body laid.
As you can see, the body could
not have fallen from above,
Therefore, it could only
have come from a train,
and the last train has passed
about midnight on Monday.
Have the train cars been examined
for any sign of violence?
- No such signs were found.
- None.
And no ticket has been found
on him.
No record of a train car door
being found open?
None.
Well, Holmes,it's time to pick
up a scent,like you did in the past.
There aren't many rail switchpoints
like that on this line,is there?
No, there are very few.
The case certainly
gets more and more interesting.
Fascinating.
By the way, I saw no signs
of blood.
There weren't any.
- Was he seriously wounded?
- The skull was crushed,
but nothing much on the
rest of the body.
And yet one would have
expected some bleeding.
I can assure you, Mr. Holmes,
that every car
has been carefully examined.
I saw to it myself.
It is not the cars that I think
you should have checked.
Let us continue, shall we?
The actual
official guardian of the papers
is the famous government
expert, Sir James Walter,
whose decorations and titles
can fill two full lines
in a book of reference.
He has spent his whole life
servicng his country,
a true gentleman,
a wecome guest in the most prestigious
society gatherings.
He is one of the two people
who had a key to the safe.
Sir James left for London
on Monday about three o'clock
taking his key with him.
- Has the fact been verified?
- Yes.
His brother,
Colonel Valentine Walter,
has testified to his
departure from Woolwich.
Can we see sir James Walter?
Sir James...
Sir James has passed away.
- Good heavens! When?
- This morning.
How did he die?
Perhaps
you would care to step in, sir,
and see his brother,
Colonel Valentine Walter?
Yes, we had better do so.
I don't think it's a coincidence
that the body was found
near the place
where the train shakes and sways
as it comes through the switchpoint.
The absence of blood
is not a coincidence, either.
The switchpoints would affect
no object inside the train.
We know that the doors were locked.
That is why I think that
he was killed somewhere else.
But how did the body end up
near the rails?
His body fell off the roof
of a train car.
- Off the roof?
- Yes.
It was this horrible scandal
that has caused this.
My brother, Sir James,
was a man of honor,
and he could not survive
such shame.
It broke his heart.
He was always so proud
of the efficiency of his department,
and this was a crushing blow.
We had hoped that he might have
given us some indications
which could help us
resolve the matter.
I assure you
that it was all a mystery to him
as it is to you and to all of us.
He had already told the police
everything he knew.
Naturally, he had no doubt
that Cadogan West was guilty.
But the rest is a mystery.
What is your personal opinion?
I know nothing myself save
what I have read or heard.
I have no desire
to be discourteous,
but you have to understand,
Mr. Holmes,
We are grieving at present,
and I must ask you to finish
this interview.
Young West took the papers.
Now, this could only be done
by having a copied key.
Several copied keys.
He had to open the building
and then the actual room and
then,a safe.
Tell us about Cadogan West.
We have nothing on him.
He worked as a junior clerk under
supervision of one Sidney Johnson.
No one else had an access to
the safe.
Who was
the other man with a key?
The senior clerk,Mr. Sidney Johnson.
He is forty, married, with five
children.
He has an impeccable
record in public service.
Who locked
the plans up that night?
Sidney Johnson.
A very unpleasant story,
Mr. Holmes.
The place is so disorganized.
Now the department chief is dead,
Cadogan West is dead,
Our documents have been stolen.
To think that when we locked
the office on Monday evening,
we were still as efficient an office
as any in the government service.
At what hour
was the office closed?
At five.
- Where were the plans?
- In a safe. I put them there myself.
Let's assume that Cadogan West decided
to make his way into the building
after hours.
He would need three keys,
before he could
reach the papers,right?
The key to the entrance door, the key
to the office, and the key to the safe.
Only Sir James Walter and you
had those keys?
I had no keys to the doors,
only to the safe.
Was Sir James a man
who was particular in his habits?
Yes, he was.
He carried those
three keys on the same key chain.
I have often seen them.
So he took that set of keys
with him to London?
He carried them with him
everywhere he went.
- Please.
- Thank you.
One other thing,
if a clerk in this office
desired to sell the information,
would it not be simpler
to just copy the documents
without stealing the originals?
It would take a
considerable technical knowledge
to copy the plans
in an effective way.
But I suppose both Sir James and West
had that technical knowledge.So did you.
No doubt we all did,
but I implore you to keep me
away from all this!
What is the use
of speculating in this manner
when the original plans were actually
found on Cadogan West's body?
It's just odd that he should
take the risk
of stealing the originals
if he could safely
have made copies,
and sell them without anybody
knowing.
Very odd, no doubt.
Mr. Johnson,
could you show us
how you close the shutters.
You see, Watson,
they cannot move any further.
So anyone could look inside the
office
from the street.
I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes.
I could get no sleep
since the tragedy,
thinking, night and day, what
the true meaning of it is.
Arthur was an honest
man, and a true patriot.
He would rather have cut
his hand off
than sell a state secret
confided to his keeping.
But the facts, Miss Westbury?
Yes,I admit
I cannot explain them.
Has he had any financial prolems?
No.
His needs were very modest
and he had an ample salary.
Arthur had saved a few hundred pounds,
and we were to be engaged
at the New Year's Eve.
Were there any signs
stress?
Come, Miss Westbury,
be absolutely frank with us.
He spoke one evening
of the importance of the secret
papers kept in a safe
and I recall now
how he said that no doubt
foreign spies would pay a great deal
of money to get their hands on them.
Anything else?
He said that the government is too
careless in such matters
and it would be easy for a traitor
to get the plans, should he try.
Now tell us of that last evening
you spent together.
We were to go to the theatre.
The fog was so thick
that ordering a cab was pointless.
So we walked,
As we were walking past his office
Arthur suddenly
darted away into the fog.
- Without a word?
- Actually...
I think he yelled something.
I waited, but he never returned.
Then I walked home.
Next morning, after the office opened,
they came to inquire his whereabouts.
About twelve o'clock
we heard the terrible news.
"To Microft Holmes.
White Hall.
Please send by messenger, to await
return at Baker Street, a complete list
of all foreign spies known to be
in England, with full address. Sherlock."
"To Sherlock Holmes.
Baker Street, 221-B. Top secret.
There are plenty of
agents,
but few who could handle
so big an affair.
The only men
worth considering are
Adolph Meyer, of 13 Great
George Street, Westminster.
Louis La Rothiere, of Campden
Mansions, Notting Hill.
Hugo Oberstein, 13 Caulfield
Gardens, Kensington.
The Cabinet awaits your final report
with the utmost anxiety.
Directives from the highest quarters
have been issued.
The whole apparatus of the State
is at your disposal
should you need it.
Mycroft."
John!
John!
John, the telegram for you.
"I'm havig a lunch
at Goldini's Restaurant,
at Gloucester Road, Kensington.
Please come at once.
Bring with you a jemmy,
a lantern,
a chisel, and a revolver.
Holmes."
Have you brought the tools?
Now it must be evident to you,
that this young man's body  was
placed on the roof of the train.
Could it not have been
dropped from a bridge?
I don't think so.
- The body would not hold out there.
- It seems most improbable.
We must fall back
on the old axiom:
When all other
contingencies fail,
whatever remains,
however improbable,
must be the truth.
I found
that the leading
international agent...
Hugo Oberstein happens to
reside in a house
which is located right next to
the railway.
13 Caulfield Gardens.
So you've figured this one out,
then?
Oberstein has left for
the continent.
I'm sure he wouldn't mind
two gentlemen paying a visit
to Caulfield Gardens in his absence.
Breaking and entering again?
I don't like it, Holmes.
My dear friend, you'll just
keep watch.
I'll do the criminal part.
Think of Mycroft's note,
of the Admiralty,
which awaits the news.
Even the Prime Minister,
not to mention of one very important
person,who shan't be named
They depend on us.
You are right, Holmes.
It's our duty.
Goddamn it!
Here we are,this must be the
window we talked about.
Look, Watson! The soot on the
sill is worn out.
You can see where they rested
the body of Cadogan West.
What is this?
It is a blood stain.
There are also a few on the
staircase.
Here is the train roof,
right underneath.
Seems I was right in my
assumptions.
What do you think of it?
You have never risen
to greater heights,Holmes.
Let us continue.
The cunning dog
has covered his tracks.
His dangerous correspondence
has been destroyed or removed.
Cutouts from newspaper.
Judging by the print, it's
an ad from the Daily Telegraph.
Not a single chance for us.
No dates, but messages arrange
themselves. This must be the first.
"Hoped to hear sooner.
Terms agreed to.
Write  to the address
given on card. Pierrot."
Second message:
"Too complex for description.
Must have full report. Staff awaits
you when goods delivered.
Pierrot."
Next:
"Matter presses.
Must withdraw offer
unless contract completed.
Make appointment by letter.
Will confirm by advertisement.
Pierrot".
Finally:
"Monday night after nine.
Two knocks.
Only ourselves. Do not be
suspicious. Pierrot."
A fairly complete record.
If we could only get the man at
the other end of the correspondence!
Have you seen the
"Daily Telegraph" today?
- No.
- A new Pierrot's advertisement.
You don't say so. Smith!
Yes, sir.
Put me through to my
brother, Mycroft Holmes.
The central?
835, please.
Thank you.
Mycroft, good morning!
Yes, it is me.
- Yes.
- Here it is.
"Tonight. Same time.
Same place. Two knocks.
Most important business.
Your own safety at stake.
Pierrot."
How do you like that?
The mine we have planted seems
to be working.
And the first casualty
was our friend, Doctor Watson.
He was blown up instantly.
Yes?
No, if you come to Caulfield Gardens
at eight tonight,
I think we can
solve our problem.
Yes.
No, no, Lestrade is essential here.
He is like a terrier you need
to pull a fox out of a hole.
Sit down, Mycroft.
Sit down, gentlemen!
This is against the law,
Mr. Holmes.
The fact that we are here,in
somebody's house without permission
is breaking and entering,
no more,no less.
Quiet, inspector. You don't
know what you're talking about.
How dare you!
Whole city is under my
police supervision!
He is coming.
Don't move.
Well,that's a surprise.
- Who is he?
- It is Colonel Valentine Walter,
the younger brother
of the late Sir James Walter.
Lestrade!
What is this?
I came here to visit Mr. Oberstein.
The conspracy is uncovered,
Colonel Walter.
We discovered the correspondence
between you
and Oberstein, along with the
circumstances
concerning the death
of young Cadogan West.
We know that you
made copies of the keys
which your brother held,
and that you engaged in
a correspondence with Oberstein,
who replied to your letters through
the advertisement columns
of the Daily Telegraph.
We are aware that
you broke into the office
on the foggy Monday evening,
but you were spotted through the office
window and were followed by West,
who had probably some
previous reason to suspect you.
Leaving all his private concerns,
he followed you closely
in the fog and kept at your heels
until you reached this house.
- Here he confronted you...
- And thats when you, Colonel Walter...
added even more terrible crime
on top of the treason you have
already commited -
- Murder!
- I did not!
I swear to you, I did not
kill him!
Tell us then,
how Cadogan West met his end.
I lost money at the stock market.
My debts were growing.
Oberstein offered me
five thousand pounds.
It was to save myself from ruin.
But as for murder, I am innocent.
What happened, then?
West had his suspicions before,
and he followed me.
The young man broke into
the house
and demanded to know
what we were going
to do with the papers.
Oberstein had a brass knuckles.
The blow proved to be fatal.
Oberstein had this idea of
dropping the body on a train roof.
But first he examined the papers.
He said three of them were essential,
and that he must keep them.
The others
we stuffed into the pocket of
Cadogan West.
so that when he is found
he'll become the obious suspect.
And your brother?
He said nothing,
but he had caught me
once with his keys,
and I think that he suspected.
I read in his eyes
that he did.
It was terrible.
Where is Oberstein now?
I don't know.
Did he leave you no address?
He said he had some business
to take care of, down in Sussex.
- Where? In Sussex?
- Yes.
Let's go, Watson.
It is on our way.
No use for this one!
Wait for me, my friend,
it will take a few minutes.
I need to drop the "Handbook of
Bee Culture" at my neighbor's.
He decided to follow my example
and become a bee keeper.
See,how quiet we have it here.
Fresh air, everything's so peaceful.
Enjoy it, Watson, while you still
can.
Mr Bork!
- Well?
- Here's my delivery at last.
- Here are the sparking plugs.
- The signals?
Same as I said in my cable.
Lamp code, Marconi,
a copy, mind you,
not the original.
That was very risky. But it's the real
thing, I can testify to that.
We should celebrate
the successful
conclusion of our business.
Just a minute.
Getting ready to leave?
Listen, Bork.
Don't tell me you keep all the
papers in there?
Why not?
You're supposed to be a superspy.
Why, a petty crook could break
into that with a can opener.
If I knew that our correspondence was
going to be kept in a thing like that
I would have reconcidered my decision
to go into business with you.
No crook could nandle my safe.
You can't cut that type of metal
with any tool.
- But the lock?
- It's a double combination lock.
You need to know a word,which
in this case,a name of the
month,
as well as a two sets of figures
and digits
before you can get
the lock to work.
This upper one is for the digits,
the lower one for the letters.
We're on the verge of a war.
It was bound o happen.
So here it is.
I'm shutting down all my activities
effective tomorrow morning.
Can you get me out of here,too,
Mr Bork?
I can't stay on this
dreaded island anymore.
A week from now England
will be in the middle of the war.
I'd rather watch it
from across the Channel.
But you're an American citizen,
you've got nothing to worry about.
So was Jack James,
and he's doing time in prison
now, all the same.
It means nothing
to a British copper
whether you're US citizen or
not.
'lt's British law and order
over here,' they'd say.
It seems to me you don't do much
to take care of your men.
- What do you mean?
- Have you helped any of them?
There's James --
It was his own fault.
You know that yourself.
He lacked discipline for that type
of work.
True.
James was a bonehead.
What about Lucas?
He had a mad wife.
He was a little mad, too.
Anyone can get mad
if he sees police everywhere.
As for Oberstein--
What about him?
Don't you know?
Oberstein was arrested
with his papers.
Now he is doing time in
Portland prison.
How did they get Oberstein?
The landlady that lives next door
had a couple of visitors recently,
Made inquiries about me.
Since we came to our agreement
Oberstein was number four.
I know I'll be the fifth.
if I don't run.
I'm just curious, who has been
selling us all out?
How dare you speak to me in
such a manner!
If I couldn't dare,sir
I wouldn't be in your service
to begin with.
Rumor has it
when an agent has done his
dirty work for you
you are not particularly sorry
to see him gone.
Are you trying to suggest that
I get rid of my own agents?
Not at all.
Just take me with you
and the sooner, the better.
We have worked together
way too long
to quarrel now,at the very hour
of our victory.
You've done splendid work
and taken great risks,
I can't forget that.I'll set it up.
First, you're off to Holland,
where you can catch a boat
from Rotterdam to New York.
No other line
will be safe a week from now.
I'll take your materials
and pack it with the rest.
What about the reward?
500 pounds.
The reward.
I want it right here, right now.
All right. Have it your way.
After all, since we are all
business nowadays, Mr. Altamont,
I don't see why I should trust you
any more than you trust me.
I give you the cheque,
you give me the parcel.
I heard everything, my friend.
What's the meaning of this?
Sherlock Holmes!
What?! Sherlock Holmes?
Yes! Sherlock Holmes!
Watson,you've got a scratch.
You were incredible,
Watson, just incredible!
What happened here,Holmes?
I'll be back soon.
Martha will explain everything.
Martha!
Doctor Watson!
- How do you know me?
- Watson, you've got a wound.
What does it all mean anyway?
It means that Mr. Holmes
did a great service
for the Great Britain.
And I'm proud to consider myself
among this great man's acquaintances.
- Mrs. Hudson!
- It is me, Doctor Watson.
You recognized me, finally.
Everything that is going on here
is a state secret.
I cannot betray it even to you.
Help me, Watson.
- Is he dead?
- No, he is just sleeping.
I gave him a strong soporific.
If you, my friend,
had delayed your impressive entrance
for just five minutes,
he wouldn't have had to jump
out the window.
He fell asleep running,
a hundred metres away from the house.
Mister Holmes,
what happened to Mr Bork?
Don't worry, Mrs. Hudson,
he is just sleeping.
Allright,then.
He is a good man, in a way.
He wanted me to go
with his wife to Germany,
but that would hardly have
suited your plans, would it, sir?
As long as you were here,
my mind was at ease.
What took you so long to
give me a signal tonight?
He was on the phone
for quite some time.
I was beginning to worry until
I saw your lamp in the window.
Are you ready to leave?
Yes, sir. He has mailed
seven letters today.
I have the addresses, as usual.
Very good.
I will look into it later.
I am so glad
to see you, Doctor Watson.
How is your lovely wife?
How is your practice?
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,
everything is just fine.
You see, mobilized again
to the military service.
So am I.
May I go, sir?
Yes, wire to Smith,
at Baker Street,
Tell him to meet us there.
Good night, Mrs. Hudson.
Yes, sir!
I wonder, what did Von Bork
pack for his departure?
Some of the information
contained in these papers
is not that valuable.
Most of them
came through my hands,you see.
German is kind of rough,
but still is the most expressive
of all European languages.
What do you think, Watson?
Tell me, Holmes,why did you ask
him for a cheque?
To make sure that not only his
shilling coins were fake
but so were the cheques.
So your plans were fake, too?
No.
No, my friend,
I had to lie to Von Bork,
but to you, I told the truth.
- "Practical Handbook of Bee Culture".
- Yes.
One thing is stil bothering me.
When and how did it happen
that you went back to work?
You see,over the last few years
as I was browsing through the press,
I became aware that some methods used
only in the criminal world in the past,
the worst kind,mind you
found a new niche, this time
in politics.
Fact is, Watson, that this gentleman
here, sleeping on the sofa
was a bit too much for our counter
intelligence.
I spent four years to get to him,
and my efforts were finally
rewarded today.
First i went to the States,
managed to become a member of the
secret Irish organization in Buffalo,
made plenty of trouble
for the local police,
and eventually caught the eye
of one of Von Bork's contacts
there
who recommended me
as a great candidate
to work in his employ.
Before you showed up, my friend,
Von Bork trusted me completely.
Truth is, it was I who tracked down and
helped capture four of his best agents.
Holmes
I long for those good old days.
All those robbers, killers,
rapists,
that you caught over the last
century
seem like innocent children
compared to the 'wolves' we've
met recently.
One can steal a million,
or kill a rich uncle,
I can understand that.
but I cannot understand
a high rank scoundrel,
who pushes millions of people to war
for the sake of a little profit.
I don't care if he is a German Baron
or an English lord.
How can we,mere mortals -
you, me, Mrs. Hudson -
stop this horror?
I don't like it at all.
What do you think about the future?
It's not so dark, is it?
I hope so, my friend.
The twentieth century has only
just begun.
