Hey, this is it, loco.
Hey, man. Fuck this, man.
I ain't with this shit.
Y'all can have this.
What?
<i>I just ain't into this
dead people shit, all right?</i>
Shit, man. That place
does look evil as hell.
Look, man, both y'all need
to shut the fuck up, all right?
We're doin' this shit
'cause this here's
business, man.
Besides, dead people ain't who
y'all need to be
worried about anyway.
Little Moe who the fuck y'all
need to be worried about.
Now, the sooner
we get the shit...
The sooner we raise up
outta this motherfucker, man.
Pass the buds, you little bitch.
Let's roll, brother.
Hey, man, uh...
Maybe I need... I need
to stay out here, all right,
and watch y'all's back and shit,
in case something funny go down.
Wait a minute, man.
You got your gat, man?
Yeah, I got my shit.
Well, if a dead motherfucker
come fuckin' with you,
you kill his ass.
Do you understand me?
Yeah, hold on...
Hold on, bulldog.
How am I supposed
to kill somethin'
that's already dead, man?
What?
Yeah, how am I
supposed to kill somethin'
that's already dead?
That's like killing
some shit twice, man.
Yeah, like some re-fried beans
and some shit.
Man, I never understood that,
man.
Why the fuck you
gonna re-fry some beans, man?
Why not just fry that shit right
the first time and get out?
Look, both y'all,
shut the fuck up, all right?
Let's just take care of
this business and move on, man.
Shit.
Fuck... this is
dead people's shit!
All right, shut up.
Ain't nothin' to be scared of.
Understand me?
- Damn!
- What the fuck? Let's go!
I've been waiting for you, boys.
- I have some iodine in the lab.
- Hey, man.
I don't need nothin'
from your house
of dead folks, okay?
Besides, I ain't no baby.
Of course, you're not.
'Looked like one
when that door swung open.
Nigger, what's up, man?
Come on... come on, partner.
Got no time for this.
Let's just take care
of this business
and move on, man.
Now, where's the shit?
The shit?
The shit...
The shit that you found.
Oh.
The drugs.
I found a whole stock of them
in the alley.
So where they at?
You got the money?
Yeah, we got the money, old man.
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>
<i>You'll get it
when we get the shit.</i>
The shit?
The shit. The drugs.
You get the drugs,
then I get the money.
Okay.
You know, this is all new to me.
I'm not a drug dealer.
I'm a mortician.
The only drugs I know about...
Are those that have to do
with the deceased.
Yo, man, what kind of drugs
do dead people be needin'?
<i>All kinds.</i>
We shoot them real good
with embalming fluid, mainly.
You know, it keeps them from...
smelling...
And decomposing
before the service.
Cool.
Hey, so what happened to him?
<i>Oh, they say he went crazy.</i>
Death...
It comes
in many strange packages.
Hey, man, I don't need
to be hearin' this, man.
I mean, kill that noise, man.
Let's just get the shit.
Don't worry.
You'll get the shit.
You'll be knee-deep...
In the shit.
I've got it hid.
There's so much...
I couldn't even
lift it all myself.
I'll tell you about...
old Clarence here along the way.
Unless, of course...
you're scared.
<i>Hmm?</i>
They say he was hearing voices...
Voices calling his name...
Voices from the dead...
Calling...
<i>"Clarence!"</i>
<i>"Clarence!"</i>
<i>"Clarence!"</i>
<i>"Clarence!"</i>
Now, Clarence, now this here
is a real quiet neighborhood...
But that doesn't mean
that you can take a break.
'Cause the second
you slack off, boom!
That's just when the shit
hits the fan.
Got it. Stay alert at all times.
That's right.
Now, let's go up and check out
this out-of-place.
Gonna lose
your badges over this.
You had no reason
to pull me over.
You got a fuckin' taillight out.
Shut up and spread
them goddamn legs.
You're not taking
any more cops' badges.
They keep selling drugs
in my community,
I'll keep taking 'em down.
You can bet on it!
Yeah? Well,
we'll see about that.
- Hey, what do we got, fellas?
- No, no, no, rookie, rookie.
He'll get it. Just back...
Back off.
Go on your way.
Go run a check
on his license plate.
See if the car is stolen.
- It's okay. Go on.
- We got it.
<i>Come on. Spread 'em.</i>
<i>Spread 'em.</i>
Now, let me ask you
something, huh?
Are you getting off on, uh...
Destroying good cops' lives,
hmm?
You big-mouthed goddamn
son of a bitch!
I've got nothing
against good cops.
You what?
I said I've got nothing
against good cops...
But I will see lowlife scum
like you
run out of the department.
Will you shut the fuck up,
cocksucker!
<i>Shit!</i>
You're fuckin' dead, bro.
You fucked up...
Big time.
Let me have some of this.
Let me have some.
Look at me!
Newton, you want in?
Yeah. Let me teach him
a thing or two.
[ Laughs I
you there, huh?
You inside, huh?
Are you there?
<i>And I promise you...</i>
we won't stop
until we get every single
crooked cop in this city.
<i>Oh, my god, Martin moorehouse.</i>
<i>Neither drugs
nor pretenders of the law...</i>
<i>Will be allowed to drain
the life of this community.</i>
- Hey!
- Son of a bitch.
Hey!
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing?
<i>Strum!</i>
- Stop them! Stop 'em!
- That's enough, strom.
- Stop it!
- Not in front of the rookie.
This man is Martin moorehouse!
I can't believe
I didn't recognize him.
Fuck.
What the hell's wrong with you?
What the hell is wrong with you?
- Hey! Hey, back off!
- Fuck off!
This is no time to be fighting.
We gotta get this guy
to a hospital!
That's right. We gotta get him
to a hospital.
Now, let's do it, huh?
- Come on.
- God.
You hear?
You want some of me?
You're out of line!
You get your ass out of here.
We'll take care of it.
Get outta here!
You get back there in the unit!
- Get out of here.
- Finish our damn patrol!
Son of a bitch.
Strom, you know
what you have to do.
Damn it! We...
We need to report
those assholes, Newton.
You listen to me!
And you listen good.
Those assholes are cops.
Who the fuck are you
to judge 'em?
Shit, man, you got a green dick.
Those two guys have
been risking their asses
on the street for years.
See, the fucker went
for strom's gun.
Aw, bullshit.
Oh, now, maybe those two guys
went too far tonight.
Maybe it was all a mistake.
But next time it could be you.
So, you know,
you don't ever roll over...
And you never...
Rat out a fellow officer.
And you never...
never break the code.
Knock, knock. We're here.
- Hospital?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Come on, boy.
We'll get you all fixed up.
Wanna have a little party?
Hmm?
You see, you were right
about one thing.
<i>The cops are dealing
drugs in the sixth precinct.</i>
But you're never gonna
tell about it, are ya?
- Think that's enough?
- Just put 'em in the trunk.
<i>Clarence!</i>
<i>Bring them to me.</i>
<i>Bring them to me!</i>
Clarence, bring them to me.
Bring them to me.
I will.
I will.
<i>I will.</i>
Welcome, officers.
For a minute, I thought
you weren't gonna show.
Man, he looks
like fly-covered shit.
Say what?
You look like fly-covered shit
there, Clarence.
Haven't seen you in a long time,
Clarence.
I've missed ya, pal.
You had the number.
You should've reached out
and touched a brother.
You could've told him how
to reach out
and touch a brother,
couldn't you, strom?
Now, Clarence...
Clarence Smith...
Come on.
Come on.
Come on down from the grave.
Now, let me ask you this, son.
What the fuck you call us
out here for, huh? Huh?
A celebration.
No, no, no.
Answer me, boy!
What'd you call us out here for?
To celebrate!
What are we celebrating tonight?
Anniversary.
Our anniversary.
You remember, don't you?
One year ago today.
I fell for your bullshit.
You know, I actually believed...
That strom and Billy were gonna
take moorehouse to the hospital.
Shut the fuck up!
You don't get it, do ya?
We tried to take him,
and he didn't wanna go.
<i>You understand?
He didn't want to go.</i>
Just cut the shit, strom!
<i>- Shut the fuck up, boy:
- Clarence: Cut the shit!</i>
Shut the fuck up!
Cut the shit!
That story never did
make any sense.
- Just save it.
- Save it for who?
Hey, Clarence,
if we go down, you go down.
Yeah, that's right, Clarence.
You go down.
You guys killed a good man
and you ruined his name!
I should've turned you in
instead of just
quittin' the force.
You quit because you're a pussy.
You're a goddamn pussy.
So I thought the least
we could do is pay our respects.
What do you mean "pay respects"?
Pay Martin moorehouse
a little visit.
Or are you too much of a pussy
to visit him?
A fuckin' fruitcake.
How are we supposed
to visit a dead guy?
Are you saying...
You want us to go
out to moorehouse's
grave with you?
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
Huh?
Fuck you.
If we go, will that be
the end of it?
You'll be satisfied?
I'll be totally satisfied.
Well, in that case,
I don't think there's a problem.
- I got no problem.
- You guys agree?
Follow me, fellas.
- Lead the way.
- Let's go.
Hey, what the fuck are we doing?
Clarence won't be
making it back.
How much further, Clarence?
Martin is right here.
This grave.
I brought them.
Are you happy?
Shit.
You expect us to believe you're
talkin' to this dead fucker?
[ Laughs I
quite frankly,
I don't know what to expect.
My orders
were to get you out here.
I'm good at that, you know?
Following orders?
It's just an electrical storm.
What the hell, all of a sudden,
we're supposed to be
scared to death?
Is that it? Huh?
Don't know, strom.
Should you be?
You know what? You piss me off.
Hmm? You know that?
I'm gonna be
the first to volunteer.
You're not gonna...
You know what I'm gonna do?
Huh?
You know what I'm gonna do, boy?
Get out of my way.
[ Laughs I
I'm gonna piss on...
I'm gonna piss on his grave.
[ Laughs I
oh.
Way to go, strom.
That's... that's pretty cool.
You know what?
Kind of dry here.
Uh, Billy, why don't you come on
over here and piss with me?
You know, I don't
need to go, man.
I took a piss right before
we came out here.
Did you hear what I said?
- Did you hear what I said?
- I don't need to.
I said go piss on it.
Now, do it!
For Christ's sakes, strom,
leave him alone.
It's okay, man.
Piss.
This'll be as good
a place as any
to bleed the
old lizard, I guess.
Come on.
Say good night.
Come on now.
Shouldn't have done that, man.
What in the hell have you done?
<i>Strum!</i>
<i>Holy shit!</i>
Let him go!
<i>Where the fuck did he go?</i>
<i>Oh, god!</i>
Where the fuck did he go?
Get outta the way!
Stop shooting, goddamn it!
There's nothing there!
He's gone!
Damn it, man, this is
no time to panic!
Well, when the fuck
do we start to panic?
- Holy shit!
- Jesus!
<i>Oh, god.
Please!</i>
<i>Billy!</i>
<i>- Billy!
- What?</i>
<i>Oh, no!
Billy. The fucker.</i>
Now! Shoot him!
Damn!
Now's a good time to panic!
<i>Damn!</i>
Get the hell outta here!
Come on, man!
To the car!
- Punch it!
- Fuck!
Right now!
- I'm trying to, goddamn it!
- Oh, for goddamn sake!
Get out...
Get the hell back!
Get back goddammit!
He's still there!
<i>How far back?</i>
Jesus Christ!
He's right behind us.
How far back?
Get him off the car!
Get him off!
What are you doing?
And what are you...
What are you gonna tell 'em?
That the body of a citizen
we murdered
has come back to kill us?
Use your fuckin' head for once!
Besides, he's gone, man!
Bullshit!
<i>Bullshit!</i>
What's happening?
Jesus! Where the hell is he?
I don't fuckin' know, man.
No!
<i>Strum!</i>
Now you!
No.
No.
No.
No, you're dead!
You're dead!
You're dead.
Motherfuck...!
Beat it, cop!
You see him? You see him?
I killed him! I killed him!
Oh, yeah... I killed him.
I killed him.
Whoa. Hey, man!
<i>No!</i>
Welcome to my world.
Are you satisfied now, brother?
Where were you...
When I needed you, brother?
[ Whimpering
no, please, don't...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't hurt me.
So, what's the story
with this guy?
Homicidal maniac.
Cop killer.
Three in one night.
And trip this.
He used to be a cop.
Wow!
Man, you just never know, do ya?
Yes, sir. Crazy as a loon.
Talk about some insane
in the membrane type of shit.
Shut up, man.
The pigs got what they deserved,
homeboy.
Nah, man.
What shit are you
talking about, man?
It can't be for real.
Sometimes... reality
is just a matter of perception.
What the fuck now?
Reality.
Perception.
A cornucopia of clashing.
Divergent ideas.
Crazy, man.
Hey, come on, man.
Man, what type of shit?
What the fuck happened to him?
Hey, can we just
get our shit and go?
Oh, no.
You're gonna want to hear
about this one.
It's a classic case...
Of what is and isn't real...
In the mind...
Of a boy... named Walter.
Perception?
Reality?
Walter.
All right, everybody,
take your seats.
<i>Okay, we have a new student
joining us today.</i>
I want you all to say hello
to Walter.
Hello, Walter.
- You wanna do something, punk?
- Yeah, we don't like punks.
- I'm not a punk.
- "I'm not a punk."
Who you shovin', bitch?
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Everybody go back
to their class.
Oh, man!
What's your problem?
You must really like detention,
huh, Ty?
Come on.
Here, honey.
Hold this up to your head.
So, uh, how's
the little warrior doin'?
He's got a thick head.
I am worried about that, though.
Did Tyrone hit you in the eye?
That didn't just happen.
It's a couple of days old.
Look at the coloring.
Tyrone didn't hit you?
<i>Well, who did?</i>
<i>Was it one of the other boys?</i>
Walter.
Was it someone at home?
Maybe your mother?
Your father?
Did he do this?
Uh-uh. He's dead.
I'm sorry.
<i>Walter, if you tell me
and nurse parch-man...</i>
It'll just be
our little secret, okay?
The monster.
The monster?
He came after my dad died.
<i>- I see.
- Hmm.</i>
If you decide you want to
tell me what really happened...
I'm gonna be here
to listen, okay?
He said no one would believe me.
Mommy.
Walter.
He's back.
Is the monster gone?
Now, Walter, you be sure and
put this back just like this.
<i>Ow! Stop!</i>
<i>Walter?</i>
You didn't want to go outside?
- What's that?
- Him.
<i>- Him?
- The monster.</i>
Laurie told me to draw it,
then we'll destroy it...
And the monster's gonna go away.
- Laurie that sits behind you?
- I'm gonna burn him up.
Laurie said that her mom said
to draw the things
that scared her...
Then tear it up or burn it...
And then it'll go away.
That's Tyrone.
Walter...
Do you think I could, uh...
talk to your mother sometime?
What for?
About the monster.
Now, you've told her,
haven't you?
She doesn't want to hear it.
She says we already moved once.
You know, I don't think...
That drawing these pictures
is really...
the answer to your problem.
But I think we can work
something out together, okay?
Okay?
<i>I guess so.</i>
Good. I will see you
after recess.
All right.
Excuse me, guys.
What happened to him?
He was running in the building
after recess
and fell down the stairs.
Well, did somebody shove him?
- No, he just fell.
- No?
Sort of collapsed.
But, you know,
it makes no sense.
How do you break both arms
and legs falling down?
Boy must've had weak bones.
- Who is it?
- I'm Mr. Garvey.
I'm one of Walter's
teachers from school.
Uh... this fell.
Thank you.
Is there a problem?
- No, no, Mrs... miss...
- Miss.
Miss Johnson, can I come in
and talk to you for a minute?
Yes. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go throw something on.
Damn.
Miss Johnson,
I came to talk to you
about your boy Walter.
Because he seems to be having
some problems.
Problems?
Uh...
Yeah. Perhaps because he
just recently changed schools.
What kind of problems?
I mean, all kids have problems,
don't they?
That's what life is... problems.
He got you good.
Here, step into
the light for me?
Oh, yeah. Um...
Well, he seems to come to school
with a lot bruises, you know?
Kind of banged up.
The boy is clumsy.
He's always falling
over somethin'.
I don't know where he gets it.
Not me.
Certainly not me.
Certainly not.
But, uh...
But he does seem to have
a strange...
Preoccupation with monsters.
<i>I mean, a monster
in particular...</i>
<i>That he says
lives here in the house.</i>
<i>It sounds silly, but...</i>
Walter!
Listen, there is no need
to bring Walter into this.
Look!
I've told that boy about
going on with these stories.
I can't have it.
Walter!
I said get your narrow behind
in this kitchen now!
Miss Johnson,
I just came to talk to you.
Get over here.
What is your problem?
Now, why the hell are you
going on
telling this man
these crazy stories?
Didn't I tell you to stop
with all this
monster foolishness? Didn't I?
Go to your room.
Baby, go to your room now.
I'm gonna have
to deal with this.
Miss Johnson, if you would
give me a second to talk?
Please... just keep quiet.
Don't say nothin'.
Well, why are you
just standing there?
Why the hell didn't you
get the door?
Who's that?
That's just one
of Walter's teachers.
He was just leaving.
Is there a problem?
No.
Actually, he just came over
to drop off some homework.
Actually, sir,
now that you mention it...
Walter does seem to be having
a few small problems...
That might deserve
some looking into.
<i>Well, Walter's only been
at this school</i>
<i>for a couple of weeks...</i>
And he does have trouble
making friends.
So what kind of problem
are we talking about?
Well, aside from the bruises...
Aside from that...
There's, uh, this monster
that he says is in the house.
He seems very disturbed by it.
In fact, he's even
drawn a picture...
Of the monster.
He, uh, thinks he needs
to kill the monster.
I mean, he...
He really believes it.
I'll talk to him.
That's it?
You'll just talk to him?
I will talk to him.
Okay.
Sissy, would you show him
to the door, please?
Thanks for the tea.
Go to your room.
- Miss Johnson...
- Go!
Walter!
You little motherfucker.
You like to draw fucked-up
pictures of people, huh?
Huh?
Carl, no!
I'm gonna teach you
and that boy some respect.
Help me!
Stop!
<i>Stop!</i>
You gonna make a picture
to kill me?
Motherfuck...!
Come here!
Carl, please!
Open up!
<i>Miss Johnson!</i>
Your little ass is mine!
Oh, you gonna draw a picture
of somebody
and make them look
like a monster?
But you think
that shit is funny? Huh?
<i>- Get up!
- Miss Johnson!</i>
- You okay?
- He's gonna kill him.
- No!
- Wait! Wait... here.
<i>Wait here!</i>
Mom.
Carl, stop it!
Just take it easy!
Take it easy? This ain't
your motherfuckin' house!
No!
- Take it easy.
- Motherfucker!
No!
'Get "no!"
I'm not through with this yet!
Come <i>here!</i> Come here.
<i>- What's it gonna be?
- Let me go!</i>
Motherfucker!
Have you lost your mind?
I see you ain't the only one
need an ass-whoopin'!
Bitch!
This shit ain't over yet, bitch.
But I think it is.
What are we gonna do?
<i>They find him here like this,
no one's gonna believe us.</i>
Don't worry.
Nobody's gonna
find out anything.
Walter, you know what to do.
Yes, sir...
Walter... killed the monster.
Hmm.
Man, is that really how
he got dropped?
Hey man, close this thing!
Oh.
What the fuck?
So dead motherfuckers be
playin' with dolls now, right?
Yes. But this doll...
It's a way station
for lost souls.
- What?
- Sometimes...
When a person's body
has been through a lot...
The soul is displaced.
This doll is a place
for the soul to survive...
Until it can move on.
Man, you for real?
<i>Yes!</i>
I found this doll...
In a house in the south.
It is an amazing thing.
<i>You can give it
any name you want.</i>
<i>The fact is, affirmative action,
quotas, reparations...</i>
<i>All mean one thing...</i>
<i>Another qualified individual
won't get a job...</i>
Or an education...
<i>Simply because
he's not the right color.</i>
<i>I thought that's what we were
trying to get away from.</i>
<i>Duke Metger for governor.</i>
<i>An original American.</i>
<i>Isn't it about time?</i>
That's great.
I'd even vote for me.
Listen, by the time
I finish with you...
You might even get
a few black votes in the till.
Well, a start would be
just getting the bastards
off my front lawn.
It's startin' to look like a
damned minstrel show out there.
Duke must go! Duke must go!
They were as relentless
about findin' a job...
As they are houndin' me...
We might put an end to welfare.
Duke must go! Duke must go!
Duke must go! Duke must go!
Beyond the obvious concern that
the black
and Jewish community share...
Over the candidacy of one-time
Klan member Duke Metger...
There seems to be
an additional issue
that has sparked anger
in the black community.
Councilman Rogers,
can you explain?
Loni, it's disturbing enough
that Duke Metger...
Would claim residency here
just for the sake
of gaining racist votes.
But the real slap in the face
to the black community...
Is that he chose this house...
This former plantation...
With its history of racism
towards black people...
To set up camp.
Can anything be done?
Well, there are certain things
that we plan to do.
Ain't nothin' we need to do!
They're gonna take care of it.
They gonna make him pay
for bein' here!
Who will make him pay, sir?
The souls... the souls gonna
make him pay!
They gonna make him pay
for bein' here.
Miss Cobbs was
the keeper of the souls.
And now, there's no peace.
There was peace but there's
no peace in the Dollhouse now.
- The Dollhouse?
- The Dollhouse!
They gonna make him pay!
The Dollhouse!
Just an old myth
around these parts.
Ain't no myth!
It ain't no myth!
It ain't no myth!
It ain't no myth!
Duke must go! Duke must go!
Go away, old man.
What is it about this house
that has them so worked up?
After the civil war,
the man who owned
this plantation,
Nathan Wilkes, he, uh...
<i>He's upset that his slaves
were gonna walk away free.</i>
<i>When they tried to leave,
the old man snapped.</i>
Turned into a massacre.
Hundreds of slaves.
Lynchin's, burnin's.
Twelve bodies hangin'
from that tree alone.
Yeah, they buried 'em
in a common grave
up on the hill.
Now, fools believe that
their souls never rested...
Till miss Cobbs,
an old voodoo woman,
bought the place.
That's... that's her there
in the mural.
<i>- What are those?
- Dolls.</i>
Legend is, she
transferred the souls
of the slaves into little dolls.
Negro dolls.
Word is,
they remain in the house
right to this day.
You ever seen any of 'em?
I searched every inch
of this house
when I first bought the place...
I figured the little
black bastards
might be worth something...
But no, I never found any.
Now they feel that
the place should remain empty...
As a... as a remembrance
to the atrocity...
To let the souls rest, like a...
Like an old Nazi camp.
Personally...
I think the whole thing adds
to a certain Southern charm.
You're a sick fuck, Duke.
Uh, perhaps.
But it's your job,
Mr. $10,000-a-week
image maker...
To change all that,
to soften the hard edges.
Mold me into a respected
man of the people.
Well, well, I've got my work
cut out for me, don't I?
You know, the first thing we're
gonna work on, Duke,
is your defensive media skills.
When you get out here
in front of these cameras...
These reporters, making these
public appearances...
You've always got to expect
the Unex...
This thing's kind of creepy,
don't you think?
I'm gonna paint
the whole place over
after the election.
Let's get you elected first,
Duke.
Okay.
<i>I feel I have a lot
to offer all the constituents</i>
<i>of this community...</i>
<i>Not just the white constituents.</i>
So are you telling us, Duke,
that your former affiliation
with the KKK...
Is not something that the voters
should concern themselves with
in this election?
We all have a past now,
don't we?
<i>No.</i>
No, ho, no, no, "0," 0, no, no.
You're being much too defensive.
Looks like you have
something to hide.
Look, I want you to watch me,
all right?
Take the camera.
I want you to film me.
All right?
Hold on. Hold it, hold it.
<i>Good.</i>
We all... have a past.
It's the better man
who can learn from his failures.
I know that I've
learned from mine
and I'm better for it.
Uh-huh.
Well, what about the house?
Well, I think
that it's quite unfair
to judge me or anyone else...
By the misdeeds
of his ancestors.
After all, I have quite a few
of my own to account for.
Aren't you afraid of the dolls?
What about the ghosts?
Well, the only spooks
that I'm afraid of...
Are the ones with guns.
That's a good one, Rhodie.
I like that.
I believe I'm gonna use it.
Oh, no. Not if you want
to get elected, you won't.
Okay? Jesus, I've been
around you too long. Okay.
Look, Duke, this is
the real response
to that one, okay?
Oh! Oh, oh...
Okay.
You know, I'm not concerned
with the ghost stories.
I'm concerned with traditional
American values.
Original...
<i>Rhodie!</i>
Let us bow our heads in prayer.
Unto the mercy
of almighty god...
We commend the soul
of our brother departed.
We commit his body
to the ground...
Earth to earth...
Ashes to ashes...
<i>Dust to dust...</i>
<i>In the sure and certain hope...</i>
<i>Of the resurrection
to eternal life.</i>
Any truth to the rumor
that Mr. Willis' death
was the result of some
mysterious circumstances?
- What about that, sir?
- No, no.
It was simply
an unfortunate accident.
Don't you think it would help
your position
with the black community...
If you simply left Wilkes manor
and found another residence?
Yeah, I think it's unfair
to judge me
or any other person,
by the misdeeds
of their ancestors.
Besides, I have many misdeeds
of my own to account for.
So, you're not afraid
of the ghosts?
No, the only spooks
I'm afraid of...
are you spooky reporters.
So, what is your real goal?
That's about it, folks.
Thank you.
You need to be scared,
Mr. Metger.
Them souls don't want you there.
They didn't want him there.
Now you best to leave...
Or you'll end up
just like him, or worse.
Well, sir, I have
no intention of leavin'...
So let's just hope that
the house and I can get along.
Can't we all just...
Get along?
Heed my warning, Metger.
They don't want you there.
- That's about it. Thank you.
- The dolls don't want you there!
That's about it. Thank you!
Go away, old fool.
Do you hear me?
They want reparation!
They want reparation,
Mr. Metger!
Driver, who'd you
let in this vehicle?
Stop the car.
Stop the damn car!
Goddamn it!
I let no one in the car, sir.
<i>This is
the real response to that one.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>
<i>- Here we go, all right.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>
<i>Go.</i>
<i>I'm not concerned
with ghost stories.</i>
<i>I'm concerned with traditional
American values.</i>
<i>Original American...</i>
What the fuck?
Bruce, I need you or Janet
to give me a call.
There's somethin' wrong here.
Bruce! Janet! You back?
Thank goodness.
You!
Where the fuck did your
little black ass come from?
<i>Huh?</i>
You think you
and some old voodoo bitch
could scare me out of my house?
I don't care how many slaves
died here.
I didn't kill 'em.
You get no reparations.
You hear me?
No reparations!
You goddamn voodoo bitch!
Huh?
I'll put an end
to your nigger ass.
Now I'm gonna blow off
your little nigger balls!
Huh?
Not even some voodoo bitch
Negress spell...
Can overcome the power
of a double-barreled shotgun!
Goddamn.
Goddamn.
I'm not afraid of you!
I killed one of you!
I'll kill you all, you...
You little nigglin's!
Come on out, you little
nappy-headed sons of bitches!
Come on.
Come on out.
Say good night,
you little piece of black shit.
Oh, Jesus.
Goddamn!
Mother of Jesus!
Come on! Open!
I didn't...
I Di...
You.
I didn't...
<i>Get off! Get off!</i>
It gives you new reverence
for dolls, now don't it?
I mean, fuck the Barbie.
This is bullshit, bulldog.
And what's up?
You gonna show us what
we came here to get, or what?
Really, though.
See, I ain't got all night to be
listenin' to no
goddamn ghost stories.
These ain't ghost stories.
Everything I say is real.
Let's get this shit over with.
Let's see how real
this shit is you got.
Ah, the shit.
[ Laughs I
yo man, you ain't gonna
believe this, man.
Man, this shit is a trip, homey.
Yes.
You knew him?
- Sure did.
- Hell, no.
We didn't know him. He was
just a nigger we seen around.
Yeah.
He got himself involved...
In that crazy gang madness.
Yeah.
Shit.
He got himself involved...
In the shit.
There's that punk
motherfucker Deke right there!
Catch you now,
you motherfuckin' bitch.
Yeah, motherfucker.
Come on, nigger.
Smoke this, nigger.
Where the fuck you think
you're goin', bitch?
Goddamn, nigger. You tryin'
to blind me or somethin'? Shit!
- Hey, what's up, lil' Deke?
- What's up, nigger?
What's up with all that shit
you been talkin' motherfucker?
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Bitch-ass nigger.
Son of a bitch!
Motherfucker!
Oh, shit!
<i>Where you want me to shoot
your ass, motherfucker?</i>
<i>In the head or in the chest?</i>
<i>Blast your little-ass
dick off first.</i>
- Man, fuck this, man!
- Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Don't do this cat just yet.
<i>I wonder how many homies
he done puked over the years.</i>
<i>Too fuckin' many!
You think he...?</i>
What's up now, crazy K?
Oh, you crazy, huh?
Lookin' kinda fucked up.
Oh, yeah.
Fuck!
Fuck!
[ Coughs I
shit!
Saved by the motherfuckin' cops.
Damn.
Oh, fuck.
Read me the summary on this one.
Uh..."Jerome Johns,
serving the fourth year...
"Of a life sentence
without a possibility of parole.
"Solitary confinement
the last two years
"for assaults on
other prisoners.
"Previous arrests
and convictions included, uh...
"Aggravated assault,
first degree battery...
Suspicion of murder three times,
aggravated mayhem."
Jerome!
<i>Jerome?</i>
How would you like
to be released from prison?
Man, is you fuckin'
with my mind, or what?
How that shit gonna happen?
Consent
to behavioral modification...
And you'll be out on the street
in no time.
- Yo, let's do this.
- Yo, let's.
He'll do.
- Prepare him for transfer.
- Okay.
Get the fuck off me, man!
Shit!
Well, look what we have here.
The first soldier
in my army, perhaps.
So you're a real
bad-ass spade, huh?
What'd you say to me,
motherfucker?
You heard me.
You gotta be really bad
to be in a place like this.
Otherwise you wouldn't be here.
So what'd you do?
What you in for?
Murder, punk!
And I wouldn't mind
doin' the shit again.
Me either.
I killed a lot of people.
You wanna know what kind?
Come over here.
I wanna show you somethin'.
What's wrong?
Are you afraid of me?
The final fight between
black and white has begun.
I've led my troops
on a wave of assaults...
To wake up my white brother.
All... of the niggers
of the earth will be killed...
<i>Except for the few that helped
with the fight against...</i>
Their mud-souled brethren.
Those few will be spared...
And live their lives as slaves.
Do you... wanna be spared?
<i>Come join my army.</i>
Hey, nigger,
those guys you killed...
What color were they?
<i>Huh?</i>
They were niggers.
<i>I know it.</i>
You're cool with me, nigger.
<i>I like you.
I like you a lot.</i>
Yeah, I didn't like bein'
put in there
with that crazy
Klan motherfucker, either.
<i>I purposely put you
next to him, Jerome,</i>
<i>because I thought he was
someone you ought to meet.</i>
You are here
to be rehabilitated...
By a process that the government
has paid me to develop.
If you successfully
complete this project...
There's a very good chance
you might be released.
If you don't, you will rot
in solitary confinement...
For the rest
of your wasted life.
And it wouldn't
bother me a bit...
'Cause I think
you're scum, Jerome.
So don't test me.
You understand?
Our tests show
you have a high IQ.
Have you ever been
interested in science?
Yeah. I sold a few
chemicals in my day.
Wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa.
I know you don't think
I'm gettin' on that thing.
You have no other choice.
Fuck!
Come on, man!
Shit!
[Gagging 1
I'll break your fuckin' neck
when I get out
this motherfucker!
[Gagging 1
I don't think so.
Motherfucker!
Start the optical sequences.
Jerome, I want you to take
a little look at something.
What's wrong, Jerome?
You don't like seein'
black people get killed?
<i>But isn't that what you've been
doin' all your life, Jerome?</i>
You know, Jerome...
<i>Cain was the world's
first murderer.</i>
<i>He slayed his brother!</i>
And how many brothers
have you slain?
Sensory what?
<i>Sensory deprivation chamber.</i>
You will see nothing.
You will hear nothing.
<i>Your mind will have nothing
to feed upon but itself.</i>
It's a tiny meal, indeed.
<i>What's up, crazy K?
Remember me?</i>
Tracy?
Yeah, man.
What's up?
How come we ain't talked
in a long time?
That's right. You killed my ass!
Ain't that a bitch?
I got one question
for you, crazy K.
Why?
Why?
Y... you was comin' up short
all the time, man.
I... I couldn't just let you
rip me off, nigger.
You didn't even know us.
That shit was wrong, man.
Just drove by
and started blastin'.
That shit was wrong, man.
We ain't even the ones
that capped your homey.
That shit was really wrong, G.
Man, fuck you, niggers!
It was your set
that did my homey, little Joe!
Y'all motherfuckers would've
tried to kill me
if you had the chance!
Man, fuck you, niggers!
Fuck y'all!
I didn't do anything.
I was playing in my room,
and the bullet from your gun
came through the wall.
A... a bullet ain't got
no name on it.
Y... you was just
at the wrong place
at the wrong time.
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!
Why should they, Jerome?
Are they saying something
you don't want to hear?
So you gonna blame
all this shit on me?
You tryin' to make me crazy
or somethin', motherfucker?
Huh?
I don't owe no responsibilities
for these motherfuckers.
But you are responsible
for the lives you've taken...
For the dreams
you've turned into nightmares.
Nightmares?
Motherfucker,
what about my nightmare?
What about the nightmare
I lived in?
What about the nightmare I
lived in ever since
I was born
into this motherfucker?
Who's responsible for that?
I don't know, Jerome.
You tell me.
Who is responsible?
Your mother? Your father?
Your teachers?
The world? Who?
Yeah, that's right.
All of those motherfuckers,
'cause they created me.
So now I'm
the motherfuckin' nightmare!
The nightmare ends
when you say it does, Jerome.
You've got to take
responsibility to wake up!
You've got to
take responsibility
to break this chain!
I got one motherfuckin'
responsibility in this world,
and that's me.
And that's it, motherfucker!
So anybody and everything
that ain't me, ain't shit!
Do you understand that?
That's a question
best posed to yourself.
I'm givin' you a chance.
I'm givin' you
a shot at redemption!
<i>Do you understand that?</i>
I don't give a fuck about none
of you stupid motherfuckers!
So what you do is stop
fuckin' with my mind, man...
And let me up out
of this motherfucker!
There's nothing
to stop you, Jerome.
Jerome!
Shut the fuck up!
Shut up!
Let me up out
of this motherfucker
or I swear to god
I'll snap this bitch's neck!
Jerome, it's not too late
to be saved.
<i>You won't get another chance.</i>
I don't need another
motherfuckin' chance.
You know why?
'Cause I don't give a fuck.
I said, I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck!
- Jerome!
- I don't give a fuck!
<i>I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!</i>
<i>I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!</i>
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't...
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
We don't give a fuck either,
motherfucker!
Oh, I must say.
I don't think you can
rehabilitate those types.
No. You just kill them.
Who you think
you're fuckin' with, old man?
What?
Yeah, cap this fool.
What? What?
You know what!
Dude, I'm just sick of playin'
this ring-around-the-rosies.
- Now, that last little story?
- Mm-hmm?
That shit wasn't funny.
Yeah, what you gonna do?
Call the cops or some shit?
Now, why...
Would I do that?
'Cause you know who it was
that killed the nigger
and you ain't said shit.
Motherfucker!
One less nigger.
- Punk motherfucker.
- Fuck him.
<i>Just bust a cap
in this old fool now.</i>
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>
Don't be stupid, motherfucker.
Now, let's just get
