Ladies and gentlemen, we
are gathered here today...
...to bereave the loss...
...of something dear to us.
We're here today to say goodbye...
...to a special friend.
To say goodbye to an idea.
Some might say that to
be here gathered today...
...to mourn the loss of a
car, would be going too far.
In 1996, electric
cars began to appear...
...on roads all over California.
They were quiet and fast...
...produced no exhaust...
...and ran without gasoline.
10 years later, these futuristic
cars were almost entirely gone.
What happened?
Why should we be haunted by
the ghost of the electric car?
This wasn't the first time
the electric car was killed.
100 years ago, there were
more electrics on the road...
...than there were gas cars.
For many people, electric
cars were the car of choice.
They were quiet and smooth
and could be charged at home.
Gas cars by comparison required
cranking and produced exhaust.
The reason I'm here I'm so
old, I remember electric cars...
...when they were
around in the beginning.
I would have been about 6 years old...
...on the way to the symphony in
that darling little electric car.
They were very quiet and it
had bevelled glass windows.
It was almost like sitting
inside of a huge lamp.
What happened? Why did the gas
car win over the electric car?
As the 20th century gathered speed,
the electric car lost momentum.
Automatic starters, cheaper oil,
and mass production gave
the edge to the gasoline car.
By 1920 the internal combustion
engine had won the race...
...for control of the roads...
...and the modern
automobile age was born.
Of the hundred of millions of
cars built in the 20th century...
...almost none were electric.
They were sleek, they were fast.
And they gave Americans the open road.
But as time went on, their number
one flaw became more apparent.
Smog.
California has the worst
air quality in the nation...
...and it impacts some of our
largest population centers.
In my district, we have what is
called the "black cloud of death"...
...that hangs over the port areas
and the areas surrounding the ports.
We are seeing some tremendously
debilitating effects.
Asthma rates, cancer rates,
lung development in children.
Children not being
allowed to play outside.
In 1989, a study found
that one out of four...
...15 to 25 year olds
in Los Angeles County...
...had severe lung lesions and
chronic respiratory disease.
In 1990 there were 41
stage-one smog alerts.
No matter what kind of car we drive...
...every gallon of gas we burn...
...adds 19 pounds of
Carbon Dioxide into the air.
The more gas we burn,
the more CO2 we create.
If we don't do something with that CO2,
if you don't sequester it, then it's
gonna be going up into the atmosphere,
and CO2 is a global warming gas.
I believe the problems
of global warming...
...will be far greater than
the problems of social security,
or even the problems
of war on terrorism.
We got the equivalent
of a nuclear time bomb...
...on our hands with global warming.
If lung disease from air
pollution is unimportant,
if all those things don't count,
we're gonna be in bad trouble.
And there is a public health crisis
that we have to have incentives,
and we have to have alternatives.
Car companies experimented with
alternatives over the years,
but none of them ever seemed to
make it out of the proving grounds.
I remember I was the chairman of the...
...board of the Tennessee
Valley Authority.
We were promoting the electric
car back in the late seventies.
And I had even planned a race
from Gatlinburg/Tennessee...
...to Nashville between Paul
Newman and Robert Redford.
And I had it all lined up
and then I realized that...
...we get a lot of national publicity...
...but there were no
cars in the showrooms.
It would take a different
kind of race to...
...make the electric car
the car of the future.
The Sunraycer was a
solar powered vehicle...
...that was developed
here at Aerovironment...
...for the purpose of winning a race.
In 1987 GM won the World Solar
Challenge Race in Australia...
...with the one-of-a kind
solar powered electric vehicle:
The Sunraycer.
Emboldened by their success,
GM´s CEO Roger Smith challenged
the same design team...
...to build the prototype
for a practical electric car.
If we were to go full speed
ahead with electric cars,
the electronics had to be good enough...
...in order to warrant that concept.
And that's where the work
of Alan Cocconi came in.
<i>Now you built the prototype
for this in your garage?</i>
Yes. Well, my garage isn't
quite the average garage.
It's actually a pretty
good machine shop...
...and electronics lab.
Yes, I built it there.
It's like a 3 channel stereo amplifier.
It provides the right side
sideways and right frequency...
...to drive the motor for all
the different driving conditions.
So, it's a 100,000
Watt Stereo Amplifier.
Alan's breakthrough power system
helped create an electric car...
...unlike any that had
ever been driven before.
They kept this car also a secret...
...much better than any
other Detroit secret...
...because it was all developed
out here in California.
So it truly was a surprise when it was
introduced to Los Angeles Auto Show.
This is gonna represent a great step
for people in terms of commuting...
...to work, from work,
...if you don't have to go
more than a 120 miles a day.
Other than the jokes
that we made about...
...the wisdom of calling
a vehicle the Impact,
...it was very impressive.
It was very high-tech and it
had an interesting premise.
We got this sort of
Corvette electric type car...
2-seater, slick styling and all that...
...and we can make a business out of it.
It was interesting. I had worked
with the program manager...
...who then called me and said...
"Would you like to be on the
electric vehicle program?"
And I said "That's fine, what
you want me to do?" and he said...
"Very simply. Develop demand
for electric vehicles worldwide."
And I said "Do you have any
instructions?" And he took a...
...blank piece of paper and shoved
it in front of me and he said...
"No instructions. You go figure it out."
And so at that point I
joined that program.
It got a lot of interest
flowing in the industry...
but it did something else.
It caught the attention of the
California Air Resources Board.
Californian Air Resources Board
or C.A.R.B. as it was known,
saw the electric car as an
opportunity to solve another problem.
Since GM had already
announced that they...
...were going to produce
an electric vehicle,
before we even adopted the mandate,
the electric vehicle
technology became...
...sort of the technology
of greatest promise.
Knowing a modern electric
car was now possible,
California regulators took a
bold and unprecedented step.
They passed the Zero
Emission Vehicle mandate.
The mandate was simple:
If automaker wanted to continue
to sell cars in California,
some of those cars would have
to be vehicles with no exhaust.
They decided "we gonna ramp
it up. We gonna say 2% in 98,
We gonna say 5 percent in
2001" and 10 percent in 2003."
For the car companies
there were only 2 options:
Comply with the law
- or fight it.
In the end, they would do both.
THE ELECTRIC CAR IS HERE
The EV1 from General Motors.
The "Impact" prototype became the EV1.
The first modern electric
production car from...
...a major US car company
in nearly a century.
GM chose its SATURN division to
market it in California and Arizona.
I bought my first SATURN at 17 and...
...they said "Do you
wanna come work here?"
And I said, ok, it will
be a good college job.
I'll put myself through
college this way...
...and it turned out
that I loved the cars...
...more than I what I
was studying in college...
and three years later they announced
the EV1 program and I jumped on it.
There were the 13 of us.
Most of whom were mid-twenties,
unattached, single, no kids,
willing to do anything for little money.
We all handled a particular
geographic region.
Mine started as L.A. and
I worked with everybody,
from engineers and
students to celebrities.
<i>I say, I say, I say
- Alexandra!</i>
I have a picture of
myself just hearing...
...this SATURN song.
It's just being so happy.
I had one of those early EV1s
and I used it here in the capital.
I loved the car.
It's sort of like everything
Americans want in a car:
They're cool, they're
fast, they're sexy.
I mean, I got in the car
and I felt like ooohhh.
It was fairly reasonably priced.
It was between 250 and
500 dollars a month.
I haven't tried accelerating too much
because there are too many cops around.
I'm afraid I'll get a
ticket. I'll be too excited.
Believe it or not. That sucker goes.
That thing will take you down the
PCH so fast you could get a ticket.
I did kind of feel like Batman. You
know that sort of like "weee"...
and the way it takes
off out of the cave,
you know I have this
gate that opens, and...
You get inside and the
console is really...
...near you and the
lighting is beautiful.
It was quiet.
Woosh.
The car was so fast it looked like
it would outrun its own shadow.
It was an awesome car to drive.
It was the crest of a wave
that we thought was coming in.
It was the new thing that was going to,
you know, change the
way everybody travels.
Other car companies began to comply,
often with conversions of gas cars,
but with many of the same
advantages of the EV1.
I'm not mechanical at
all but I love filling...
...the electric car
because it's so easy.
I plug it in at night and when I need...
...to drive it I unplug
and drive it away.
They're for people who
love the environment.
I say they're just for
people who love cars.
They're for people who
have to go somewhere.
Well, this is amazing.
What you do with this electric
car, Dave, you put the key in,
and you turn it...
and there's this thing on
the floor called the pedal.
A pedal!
The exciting thing about this, is the...
...cost of operating
the car is the same...
...as if you're driving a typical gasoline car.
But the gasoline only
costs 60 cents a gallon.
Going to the gas station is a hassle -
- believe it or not.
Plugging a car in is not.
The battery, that you
charge at home, gets...
...about between 70 or
80 miles per charge...
...which for me is more
than all the driving...
...that I need to do
in the course of a day.
People started seeing the
cars on the road and...
...getting a better understanding
of what they could do.
Friends and neighbors
and relatives started...
...saying "Hey, that's
a neat idea, you know."
"I should get one of those."
And we start seeing the
momentum building for this,
and the waiting lists being
created for these cars.
Cut two. Cut two. I go online
to look for other Toyota RAV4s.
And I see: Toyota RAV4 EV.
And I said: What's that?"
Click! Wow, my whole world opened up.
It's an electric vehicle, it goes
a 100 miles to a charge, blablabla...
It's just like: I didn't
know that this existed.
I didn't know this was a possibility.
How come I don't know about
this? Have you seen this on TV?
When I first tried to
buy the Honda EV Plus,
I drove it and said "Hey,
this is a great car!"
I said "I'll take it."
The person who was trying to
sell it to us was dumbfounded.
He didn't know what to do.
He had never leased one before,
didn't know how to do it and it
took me 6 weeks of negotiations...
...before I was able to get
the car from their hands.
There is nothing like
driving a car where...
...you realize as you're
sitting in traffic...
...there's no pollution
coming out of your tailpipe.
There's just the batteries on board.
By driving an electric car,
what are you sparing us from?
I'm saving America, Dave! That's
what I'm doing, I'm saving America...
...by driving an electric car.
- God bless you -
Not everyone was sure that
electric cars would save America.
Even as GM rolled out its first
batch of EV1s, there were sceptics.
Consumer acceptance and understanding
has been a key issue in all of this.
And what we discovered is that people...
...are very cautious
about the electric car.
I would consider it but I don't know.
I haven't done enough research
and I don't know if they're like...
...if they're gonna be
strong, big and dependable.
I have to know where I can go to,
like recharge it, or what
I got to do for the battery.
People don't want a mini tiny car
that has 15-inch wheels on there.
How is he gonna fix that up
and go round town and parade it?
While some consumers express
skepticism about electric cars,
California was pressured
to drop the mandate.
A group called "Californians
Against Utility Company Abuse"...
...fought a small utility surcharge
to build charging stations.
They would go to local City
Council meetings and say:
"You don't want to put in an electric...
...vehicle charging station there."
That's a waste of taxpayer money.
They had this list of supporters.
You know, companies like Trader
Joe's and others which you'd say:
"Why would they support
something like this?"
So the EV drivers actually got
together and started writing letters
to some of these people who
were listed on their website,
as being supporters and said "Do you
realize what you're supporting here?"
And they got all these
names removed from the list.
Further investigation
revealed that these groups...
...were consumer
organisations in name only,
funded almost exclusively
by the oil industry.
Oil companies also paid for
editorials in national publications.
They even argued that the environmental
benefits of EVs were dubious.
With electric vehicles: We gonna
have this shift on energy away...
...from oil.
And if we are shift it to
coal , there are some...
...environmental problems that
are just very disconcerting.
Right now in the United
States we are 55 percent coal.
if you run the numbers with
standard coal power plants...
you don't end up with a better
environmental performance,
you end up with a longer tailpipe.
There have been numerous
studies conducted...
...by the California
Energy Commission...
...that clearly show
that electric driving...
...is substantively more efficient...
...and substantively less polluting,
even if you get your electricity
from coal fired plants.
But the arguments against
electrics did not stop there.
They even made this
ridiculous argument...
...that there was an environmental
justice issue involved...
...because they said only rich
people could buy electric cars.
Well, the air doesn't know a boundary
between Brentwood and South L.A.
Car companies began to argue
that the mandate was too strict.
We had to help with the regulations.
The regulatory people knew
nothing about this stuff.
And we began to get the eerie feeling...
...that we are going over a cliff.
It wasn't going to be possible.
California was faced with the
prospect of what do you do,
if the car companies don't comply.
And so rather than...do
brinkmanship about...
...what would happen if they
didn't comply and stick with it,
they started negotiating...
...certain flexibility in the mandate.
California compromised
with the automakers...
...adopting a memorandum of agreement.
One of the agreements with the State
was that the automakers would build...
...and market electric vehicles
in accordance with demand.
If they didn't want
to build more of them,
the car companies would
have to make the case...
...that there is no demand.
The person will go unnamed,
but we were having
lunch in the executive...
...dining room at the
GM Tech Center one day.
And just the two of us.
And he leans over to
me and said "Dabels,
you know something?
You are my worst enemy."
And I said: "Why's that?" And he
said "well, I'm out there lobbying...
...to show that there is no
demand for electric vehicles...
...and you are out
there proving me wrong."
We would sit down with Hal Riney or
with the executives of GM and ask:
..."How far, how fast, how much?"
These are the three
questions we're getting.
Please put it in the advertising.
It's not rocket science.
And they would go back
and do the exact opposite.
You know we never saw a TV ad...
...with an electric car
scampering up the side of a hill...
...with a good looking man
or woman draped around it.
That's the way they sell cars.
How does it go without gas and air?
How does it go without
sparks and explosions?
How does it go without
gears or transmissions?
How does it go you will ask yourself?
And then...
...you will ask...
...How did we go so long without it?
The electric car.
it isn't coming.
It's here.
What was the objective
of these advertisements?
Was it to entice consumers,
or to scare them away?
Our goal at GM was to make the...
...full functioning
battery electric vehicle...
...a commercially viable business
opportunity for General Motors.
GM spokesman Dave Barthmuss has
worked for GM for nearly 10 years.
We spent in excess of
1 billion dollars...
...to drive this market,
to build the market,
that means award winning advertising,
developing the vehicle,
developing the recharging
infrastructure...
and in a 4 year time frame,
from roughly 1996 to 2000...
...we were able to lease 800 EV1s.
So we started this waiting list
in order to prove demand to GM...
...but no matter how many
people we got on that list...
...it was never considered enough
demand. Everything was anecdotal to GM.
We have heard about
this long waiting list.
And frankly we did have a
list of roughly 4.000 people,
that raised their hands
and said... "I would be...
...interested in getting into
an EV1 and being an EV1 leasee."
We contacted each of those folks.
And we whittled that list down.
And when we actually got
down to a point when we...
...were able to have somebody
sign on the dotted line,
that list from 4.000 people...
...shrunk to about 50.
Only recently did they finally admit
that there actually was a waiting list...
...and tried to explain it in a way,
that by the time we explain
all the limitations...
...of the car to them,
only 50 would sign up.
If you sincerely want to
market a product you don't...
...start out by describing
the limitations of the product.
Tom Everhart is President
Emeritus at Caltech.
He served on GM's Board
of Directors for 13 years.
I do not think General
Motors tried hard...
...to get the electric cars out rapidly.
Whether the CEO of General Motors
understood that, I don't know.
We had to ask permission of whoever
we wanted to give a car to...
...and by the end when we were low on
cars, we had to write case statements.
We tried to put the cars in
hands of celebrities because...
...they were number one. The only ones
they stood a chance of getting the car.
The 3rd grade science
teacher didn't stand a chance.
I had to write a resumee for Mel Gibson
and what he'd done and accomplished,
because the people I was talking to,
didn't believe that he warranted a car.
I was wondering why to
fill this out, you know.
You had to tell them where
your birthmarks were, you know.
I mean it was everything, you know.
Have you recently had a
proctoscope inserted into you ...No!
You know, you had to get really
specific about a whole bunch of things.
Consumers wanted it,
but they regarded it as
a limited vehicle and...
...they expected to pay
a limited price for it.
And there is nothing irrational about
the consumer that said that to us.
That's a perfectly reasonable statement.
"You give me a vehicle that does less
- I wanna pay less."
Ok!
but unfortunately I
couldn't make it for less.
They argued things like money and
they are too expensive to build and...
...yet they're building
4 a day. I mean, very...
...hand-built cars with
specialized components.
And had they mass marketed them,
they of course would have come down.
As car companies made the
case there was no demand,
electric vehicle advocates
thought they had a sympathetic ear
with the appointment of
environmental scientist Dr. Alan Lloyd
as chairman of the California
Air Resources Board.
First time I presided over that,
I felt that the car companies were´nt
making a significant effort to do it,
so I found that well flog them harder.
Flog them often. They need to do better.
For the regulation we felt
needed to be changed drastically.
And there was some movement
that way, but it didn't go away.
While the car companies fought
the mandate in Sacramento,
GM quietly closed its
EV1 assembly line...
...and began laying off its sales force.
All of a sudden we were
not only taken off...
...the project but
taken out of the company.
They started with the
ones with the most, the...
...biggest waiting list
and the most customers...
...and the primary areas were the
ones that they dismantled first...
and so at the end of 2001,
you know, that was it...
...in terms of my employment
with General Motors.
Studying General Motors
practices over the years,
and I don't speak for the
engineers and scientists,
who really would have liked
to have done a better job...
...with motor vehicle technology.
But the executives at the top,
their motto seemed have been...
...going backwards into the future.
And that's what they've
been doing for decades.
As a veteran consumer advocate, Ralph
Nader used grassroots campaigns...
...to make cars safer
and more fuel efficient.
He is familiar with the tactics used
by the auto industry to resist change.
There are all kinds of ways to take
and bring politicians to their knees.
Once the auto companies get a long
lead time, then they go to work...
eroding, eroding and
then when the deadline...
...is approaching say we can't do it...
...and there are gonna
be terrible consequences.
Automakers took the
fight to a new level:
They sued California's
Air Resources Board.
GM lead the lawsuit, soon joined by
Chrysler and several auto dealerships.
As California withered
under the pressure,
the carmakers found a powerful new ally:
The federal government.
Shortly after joining the suit, the...
...Bush Administration
made another announcement:
Tonight I'm proposing 1.2 billion
dollars in research funding.
So that America can lead the world in...
...developing clean
hydrogen powered automobiles.
The federal government
joined the car and oil...
...industry to embrace a
new clean car of the future.
With more than a billion
federal dollars up for grabs,
over the next few years the campaign
for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles...
...began to sway California.
Hello there and welcome to the
California Fuel Cell Partnership.
We're fueling the future in a new
and environmentally friendly way.
Automakers, energy and technology
providers, along with...
...government agencies are
voluntarily working together...
to commercialize the fuel
cell for cars and buses.
Soon you may see one of these cars...
...cruising through your
very own neighborhood.
We wanna just dream about
the hydrogen fueling stations?
We wanna just dream
about the hydrogen cars?
We will build it.
The hydrogen Hummer is not a production
vehicle. It's a concept vehicle.
It's a way for Governor
Schwarzenegger to have...
...a property at various
events that he goes to...
...when he unveils a new hydrogen
refuelling station at LAX, for example.
I'm going to encourage the
building of a hydrogen highway,
to take us to the environmental future.
While hydrogen fuel cells offered an...
...exciting alternative
some time in the future,
what would happen to
the technology of today?
What would happen to the electric car?
It all came down to a decisive meeting
at California's Air Resources Board.
Citizens and industry alike,
testified as C.A.R.B....
...prepared to vote on the
fate of the electric car.
I'd also like to thank all
the other stakeholders...
...particularly also
the auto industry...
...who is going also
have a major impact here.
I like the fact that hydrogen
might be in a position...
...to displace the petroleum products.
I share your optimism on fuel
cells just not to the extent.
I think it's a bait-and-switch
strategy - I hope I'm wrong.
I'm concerned that we´ve picked...
...numbers that are based
entirely on fuel cells.
What if fuel cells don't work?
It seems that most of the
recent changes to the mandate...
...have been designed to ease
the burden on the automakers.
You're part of the Environmental
Protection Agency...
...not the "Corporate
Profit Protection Agency."
I think that we've been
a contributor to this...
...market place too, and...
- I agree, I agree, I agree -
But remember there are
many of you we just...
We're not giving more
time to the auto manufacturers ...
Lou Browning I think had the
job to present the EPRI report...
...and he'd been promised 10 minutes.
One of the things we found is
- Dr. Browning...
...I would appreciate you would
summarize this in 3 minutes.
Ok. I thought I had 10 but...
Alan Lloyd cut him off,
...whereas he had
given the automakers...
...sort of unlimited
time earlier in the day.
The improvements we need in fuel
cells are to get mainly the cost down.
In addition we have recently
certified and introduced...
...the Honda FCX Fuel Cell Vehicle.
Largely this work is
being pushed forward...
...through the California
Fuel Cell Partnership...
...which has been very valuable in
pulling together the diverse interests.
Any new information on batteries that...
...didn't mesh with the
overall conclusions...
...was really just shut
out very fast by Alan Lloyd.
Let's get it clear. I'm not trying
to show any bias or anything here.
There were 80 people who came
to speak for electric cars,
and only 2 industry representatives
on the side to kill the mandate.
We have 4 people out of 78 who
are supporting this proposal.
How did we end up with this?
This is a tough, tough program.
It's a revolutionary program.
It pushes the automakers hard and they
don't like it and they push back hard...
...and as you deliberate today
on the fate of this program,
I urge you to summon all
of your political courage...
...to make the hard choices...
...that you know you need
to make on this program,
because when it comes to protecting the
health of the people of California...
...there are simply no more
easy choices to make.
I saw this as losing this
wonderful opportunity...
...that we had really
invested a great deal...
...in the infrastructure,
in the technology.
It was like the rug was pulled out.
They gave it away. And
to me that's just sad.
It's a sad commentary on...
...the way our society and our
system in the United States works.
When GM introduced the EV1,
California was setting the toughest
auto pollution standards in the nation.
10% of all cars sold here this year
were to be Zero Emission Vehicles.
But California dropped those standards
after being sued by automakers.
A lot of the vehicles, the Honda
vehicles, the General Motors vehicles,
were all leased and nobody
had the option to buy.
So the automakers took
advantage of that...
...and pulled all the cars off the road.
They were unwilling to
let people take the cars...
...and actually drive them and
keep driving them like normal cars.
I`ll tell you when I noticed
that GM was losing interest...
...was when I wanted
to re-lease my car...
...and they wouldn't let me.
I've never had a product
I've had to beg and fight...
...and cajole and persist so much to get.
And then had to try
and beg and fight...
...and find any way
possible to try and keep.
Well, they did not really
give an option to buy.
They said "Thank you for leasing
the car, bye bye. Turn it in now."
"Turn it in by such and such a day
or you're gonna be held liable."
GM had very quietly gone about...
...taking cars back without
anybody saying very much...
...other than some of the
drivers that complained...
...about having their cars taken away...
...but never in a big organized fashion.
So they had no choice
but to turn them in or...
...face the legal consequences
of basically stealing a car.
To my knowledge all the
cars were turned in...
...because people had too much to lose.
To this day, the
automakers have fought...
...anyone actually understanding
how much demand there was...
...and how much demand that there is.
So we decided that we were gonna
fight them, in whatever way we could,
and we became organizers...
Across California, drivers held
protest to save electric cars.
...turn my head around
about electric cars.
And it broke me and my addiction to oil.
Unable to change policy,
activists staged a funeral
to raise public awareness.
It was the same month as...
...the first stage one smog alert
in Southern California in 5 years.
I was an EV1 driver,
still am from 1998 until
december of this year...
...when GM will have to pry it out
of my charger's dead cold hands.
What the detractors and the
critics of electric vehicles...
...have been
saying for years, is true.
The electric vehicle
is not for everybody.
Given the limited range,
it can only meet the needs
of 90% of the population.
People used to ask me "Why
do you do what you do?"
And I, especially after
I had my son, told them.
I figure if I do my job well enough...
...my son will never know a time before
there were electric cars on the road.
And he rode in an EV1
on the way over here,
and he said: "I wish we could
keep the EV1 for a long time."
And all I could say was "me too."
By the summer of 2004, there
was only a single EV1 left...
...in private hands
in Southern California.
Today is D-Day. Today is the end.
GM did do it right: they did
create a great, great car.
It's well engineered, well designed
and it's enjoyable to drive.
I've never seen a company be so...
...cannibalistic about
its own product before.
It's such an odd experience.
<i>What makes that car go?</i>
You press this...
It´s an electric car like daddy had.
Hey, You got here just in
time. - I know. I can see that. -
So sad.
This is the EV specialist I was
talking about, who gave me her car.
Completely sad. Heartbroken.
Are you kidding me?
They were my babies. Everyone of them.
A lot of human potential just drove off.
The fight continues.
- It does! -
With no more electric cars on the road,
General Motors now had possession
of their entire EV1 fleet.
Why did they want them back?
What were they gonna do with these cars?
We had discovered 78 EV1s...
...parked in the back parking lot of
a facility that GM owns in Burbank.
They were taking off the cars that
were on the road that were running fine.
Just let those people drive those cars
until they can't drive them anymore.
Where are you guys from?
We are members of the EV1 club.
And we wanna come and
take a look at our cars.
I know they are being mothballed here.
Yeah, I have no
authorization for you guys...
...to come back there
to look at the cars.
Can we just go and like...
- No -
There were no clues as to
where the cars were going.
Until a rumor surfaced on the internet.
We had the understanding
through back channels...
...that these vehicles were about to
be taken to the Arizona proving grounds.
Many EV1s had apparently
been trucked out of state,
to GM's vast proving
grounds in Mesa, Arizona.
The track is so large that the
map has the track denoted here.
The location was off
limits to the public,
and there was no way of
knowing where the EV1s might be.
Flying over GM.
No one around it.
There they are.
Wow!
So we flew over General
Motors and looking down...
...we could see right next to the race
track where the EV1 was first tested...
...we saw, I dunno, maybe 50 EV1s...
...crushed and put on
top of semi-flatbeds,
right next to the yellow crusher.
General Motors is almost
finished off. I think.
I don't imagine there are many EV1s
left that haven't been crushed out.
It's pretty sad.
There's one of 4 things that
will happen with the EV1s:
They will go to colleges and
universities and engineering schools.
They will go to museums and
other displays across the country.
Other EV1 vehicles are being
driven by our engineers.
And the other option for the EV1s at
the end of their life is recycling.
But know that every one, every part
of the EV1 is gonna be recycled,
dismantled through a 3rd
party and then reused.
Everything is gonna be
recycled. We're not just...
...gonna crush it and
send it off to a landfill.
When I saw the picture of the
pile of crushed cars, it hurt.
And I thought it was pretty spiteful.
To see on the computer,
you know, on the internet,
the crushed EV1s that GM did.
It was wrong. It was wrong...
- tragic, that was tragic -
...but more wrong is the reasons for it.
All of a sudden we were
sort of left at odds.
You know, what do we do now?
And at the time that
most of this was going on...
...no one had the idea that every
automaker was going to jump ship.
More internet tips revealed
that the EV1s were...
...not the only electric
vehicles in jeopardy.
A number of Ford Thinks and
Ranger electric trucks...
...were discovered in Palm Springs.
and rumored to be set for destruction.
In Los Angeles activists spotted
a truck load of Toyota RAV4 EVs.
Fearing the destination was a
crushing facility, they chased it.
The next morning, the truck turned back.
That guy was going
as fast as he possibly...
...could in a big transporter like that.
Trying to lose us it was clear.
But wasn't able to do it and of
course that did change Toyota's plans.
It was so inconsistent. They
didn't know what the hell to do.
Then he goes to the end of the pier...
...and these two big
security guards come out.
They opened this locked gate,
the truck goes inside...
...and then the security
guards came out and surveil us.
Somehow we ended up at
this god-forsaken place.
It has everything. It
has spewing smoke into...
...the harbor where the
kids have to breathe.
It has an oil-well...
...and it has Toyota, which is supposed
to be the greenest car company...
...but which is
simultaneously crushing...
...and hiding the fact
that they're crushing...
clean-round 4 AVs instead of
selling them to willing customers.
No one had seen Honda's electric cars...
...since they were taken from customers.
Then, an episode of
California's Green aired on PBS:
So we're gonna be able to
see cars shredded today.
Absolutely.
Which is not something
most of us get to see.
We shred the cars. About a car a minute.
A 1.000 cars a day
- on a good day.
And what's interesting, the first thing
we noticed when we drove up here...
...you gonna be shredding
some new cars here too.
These look like perfectly good
cars. Why are you shredding them up?
Little bit of a mystery really, since
I've been here the last 8 years,
they bring us these cars
from the dealerships...
and they say they're test
cars and that they've...
...been brought over to
test various emissions...
...and the insurance companies
won't reinsure them...
...so they have to watch
them destroyed here.
Boy, that seems like a shame. I'd like
to drive off in one of these things.
Ladies and gentlemen, that's the
sound of a crushed automobile...
...being shredded into a million pieces.
There is no precedent for
a car company rounding up...
...every one of a
particular kind of car...
...and crushing them as they
are afraid one might get away.
I think they wanted to be sure...
...that no one of them were
driving around the streets any more...
...to remind people that there is
such a thing as an electric car.
People keep making all
these analogies about...
...crushing the EVs is a
betrayal of the American dream.
It's not a dream, I mean, it's here now.
It may be a betrayal of my dream...
...but it's a betrayal of
the American reality.
After the discovery of
the crushed EV1s in Arizona...
...electric car drivers took action.
They vowed to keep watch...
...over the remaining EV1s being
stored at the GM facility in Burbank.
There are about 70
cars left in California.
They're in the parking lot behind me.
And they have plans
to crush those as well.
And we need to make a call to action...
...on General Motors, to give them back.
You know, we ended up
rallying enough troops...
...in terms of interest and
organizations to join our coalitions...
...and then simply didn't leave...
...and stayed, you know, 24
hours a day, seven days a week.
It's 6 a.m. and I've been here
for an hour, part of the vigil...
...making sure that GM doesn't sneak
out their cars in the backlot.
The first 2 weeks we
were pretty much ignored.
Monsoon rains and it was kind
of depressing to be out there...
...but as the same time there
was such a sense of "mission".
I was here this morning
from about 5.45 a.m.
and, you know, it's pretty quiet.
Finally on day 15 we did this
announcement of this offer.
As the EV1 activists recorded the
VIN numbers of the cars in storage...
...Chelsea led a last ditch
effort to buy the cars from GM.
Ok, General Motors contends that
no one wants these EV1s here.
"Would anybody be willing to buy them...
...for the residual
price of the lease"...
...and within 48 hours,
over 80 people had signed up.
There were only 78 cars
in that lot and already...
...we had a waiting list for
a car that wasn't available.
It was a tremendous "Dejà Vu" moment.
So, at this point we thought
it would be appropriate...
...to come full circle,
join me in holding this cheque...
...offering 1.9 million
dollars to General Motors...
...to put these cars back on the road.
Despite the offer, GM did not respond.
The fate of the last 78
EV1s remained in doubt.
A small group of activists
would continue their vigil...
...to keep the dream of
the electric car alive.
Who controls the future?
Whoever has the biggest club.
It's, in more ways than one.
One they can bash you in,
and one they can belong to.
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
I know you're all worried.
And I agree.
There is plenty to be worried about.
Like this solar power plant.
Already operational outside Los Angeles.
Photovoltaic cells.
They convert sunlight
directly into electricity.
Fluorescent.
Lasts 10 times as long as
a conventional light bulb.
Uses only a quarter of the power.
Super windows.
Insulate as well as 10 sheets of glass.
An electric car.
Partially powered by solar panels.
But the truth is, gentlemen...
...I'm not worried about
any of these things.
Because no one's ever
going to know about them.
So there's all these
conspiracy theories out there...
...about "Who killed the electric car?"
So really "Who killed the electric car?"
Well, unfortunately I can't
summarize that in one sentence.
What killed the electric
vehicle very simply,
I think, is lack of corporate wisdom.
In my opinion it's Big Oil
that killed the electric car.
Alan Lloyd killed the
electric car program.
I was there when he did it.
The California Air Resources
Board killed the electric car...
...under huge pressure
from the auto companies.
They were an accessory to the murder,
but the murder was created
by the General Motors Company.
I don't believe that for a minute.
GM would sell you a car that
ran on pig shit if it sold.
Car makers argued that there was not
enough demand for the electric car.
Claiming to have spent millions
of dollars on advertising...
...they said buyers were'nt interested.
But did consumers even
know that the car existed?
Did you hear this? Did
you ever see this...
...car advertised or
heard anything about it?
Never. That's what I'm trying to say.
it is totally under
the scope of the radar.
I don't know who
drives an EV1 actually.
- You don't know anybody?
- Anybody.
Maybe Fernando. I know
Fernando...you ever drive an EV1?
<i>I've heard about it.</i>
He's heard of 'em.
So they're not making these
cars in California anymore?
<i>I know. They don't
make them anywhere.</i>
That's really too bad.
We need those cars.
So, why are they getting rid of it?
<i>Well, they said there
is no demand for the car.</i>
Are they insane?
That's a no-brainer! Of
course there's demand.
Save gas, save people, save
air, save oxygen save the world.
All sounds good to me!
We've been selling
vehicles for a century...
...and as you might imagine, we sort
of figure out what people wanted.
If you asked them they said
we want a 300 mile range,
I wanna be able to go
85 or 90 miles an hour...
...and I want to carry 4
passengers and have a big trunk.
Which is basically what
we were already selling.
I've said this time and time again:
people will buy anything
you convince them to buy.
If you feed people enough, then
they believe that's the diet.
Consumers? They couldn't see
the difference, between...
...an electric car and the
car they're already driving.
You know, because they don't
read environmental impact,
They don't read political instability...
...caused by oil production
in the Middle East.
All they read is "does this car
work? And how much does it cost?"
What really killed EVs
was American consumers.
Because they did not accept this idea,
did not embrace it,
that vehicles could have
these limited ranges...
...and still be functional,
useful, practical.
Did the electric car die
because of battery technology?
Did EVs really not have enough range?
And did car companies use
the best batteries available?
Battery technology at that
time was lead-acid batteries...
...and allowed the car to go 60 miles.
If you started out on a trip knowing...
...that you were gonna
go dead in 60 miles...
...you'd be nervous
about making the trip.
People think that they need
a car that will go 300 miles...
...and be able to charge it
up or refuel it in 5 minutes.
For virtually 90-95% of your
driving, you really don't need that.
You need a vehicle that will
go at least 60 miles or so...
...and that way your daily
commute is covered.
For those who wanted greater range
from an EV, 100 miles or more...
a better battery already existed,
developed by a well-known inventor
working in Troy/Michigan...
...about 30 miles from
General Motors Headquarters.
Stanley and Iris Ovshinsky
I think you shouldn't do it
that way. You should say...
...you're Stan Ovshinsky and
then I'll say I'm Iris Ovshinsky.
Don't do it that way. That's funny.
With over 200 patents to his name,
Stan Ovshinsky had
pioneered a new battery...
...and GM purchased controlling
share of his company.
We were chosen over 60 different,
big companies, like
Westinghouse and others,
who wanted to win the race
to make the batteries...
...that would be used
in pure electric cars.
And we were chosen
because we had a battery.
And to us, putting it
into a car was not the...
...most gigantic thing
what we were supposed to do.
But you did sort of
expect Champagne and Roses.
I expected Champagne and Roses.
I said that we gonna put
in a paragraph into...
...a newspaper that
said we had achieved this.
I really expected
congratulations to flow in.
And then I knew that something was
different when the opposite happened.
Ovshinsky was censured
for publicizing...
...his battery advances
without permission.
And asked not to run advertising
in national publications.
The EV1 debuted with a weaker battery.
It would be another 2
years before Ovshinsky's...
...batteries were installed in the EV1.
The first version of
the EV1 had defective...
...DELCO Batteries and
then they kept failing.
So that was GM's failure
on those batteries.
Once they put good batteries in,
they didn't have any problems.
Ultimately GM sold its share in...
...Ovshinsky's company
to an unlikely buyer.
Then when the nickel-metal
hydride batteries were improved...
...so that they're now lasting
longer than the life of the car...
...and cheaper than an engine,
Chevron-Texaco stepped in...
...and purchased control from General
Motors of Ovshinsky Technology.
The oil companies did not feel
threatened by battery technology...
...because they have
effectively crushed it.
You know the electric car has
been an interesting case study.
It was such an abismal failure...
...that I think there were a lot of people
involved in the initial decision-making...
...who are pointing fingers at who
has the responsibility for this?
To Basra and all the Iraq, comes good...
...news with the opening
of a new oil field.
The pipeline runs across the desert
to the Persian Gulf at Al-Faw.
There tankers load up with the
precious fuel, the world needs so badly.
Yes, it's a big day for Iraq,
and there is a feast to celebrate.
Sheep, stuffed with rice and
a host of other good things.
But that's only the first of the good
things that will come to the Iraq,
thanks to OIL.
Oil companies have rarely
shied away from global issues.
But why did they lobby so hard...
...to build public opposition to
the electric car in California?
I find it difficult to rationalize...
...why the oil industry got so
intimately involved in this other...
...than maybe they saw it as a threat...
...to what I would call
the Monopoly they...
had on providing the
transportation fuel.
There is no question, the people
who control the marketplace today,
the oil companies, have a strong
incentive to discourage alternatives.
Except the alternatives
that they themselves control.
And, you know, just as General Motors...
...forty, fifty years ago bought up the
trolley systems and shut them down...
...the oil companies have opposed...
...the creation of an
electric infrastructure.
I differ strongly with that.
We did not kill the electric car.
The petroleum industry did
not kill the electric car.
What killed the electric car
was antiquated technology.
It's a good example and
something we should not repeat.
An example that we need to avoid.
There's still roughly a trillion barrels
worth of oil in the earth's crust,
and if you figure that
the average price...
...of that subsequent oil will
be a hundred dollars a barrel...
...that's a hundred trillion
dollars worth of business...
...yet to be done.
However, at some point, when
an alternative is good enough...
...people will snap over...
...and that's what the oil
companies fear the most.
We use 280 million gallons of
gasoline a week in California.
Right now the price is $2,20.
Well, a year ago it was $1,20.
There is a dollar more a gallon!
Somebody's making 280
million dollars more a week.
This year, it's the same gas, the
same pipeline, the same refineries.
The profits are outstanding.
What the oil companies
feared, is that...
...electric vehicles
would become successful...
...6 years from now.
What the automobile
companies feared, was that...
they'd be losing money
on electric vehicles...
...in the next 6 months.
Even as car companies made electric
cars, they fought them at every step.
What was their motive?
Why were they so determined
to take them off the road?
I think in the beginning,
General Motors...
...didn't believe the
car was gonna catch on.
I don't think they thought
they'd ever have to worry about...
...something like a conspiracy
to keep it from happening.
They hated the mandate,
they hated it so much,
that they ended up...
...not even really wanting
to be in the business of EVs.
What I frankly detected
was a huge resentment...
...about being told what type
of motor vehicle had to be made.
And it became a fight of principle...
...rather than one of
trying to actually...
...technologically solve the problem.
I do know that I was surprised at
some of the stances they took...
...in Sacramento in arguing...
End of comment.
In a confidential
1995 memo, the American...
...Automobile
Manufacturers Association...
...sought to hire a PR firm
to manage a so-called...
..."grassroots and
educational campaign"...
...to create a climate
to repeal the mandate.
The challenge according
to the document...
...was "greater consumer
acceptance of electric vehicles".
Why would the car companies campaign
so hard against their own creation?
I made the case at the
General Motors Board...
...that the reason for the EV1...
...was to give General Motors
a very big head start...
...in how you transform electricity
into the drive power for the car.
And we give them 2 or 3 years lead.
And in my judgement it did.
But my frustration was, they
did not capitalize on the lead.
And the reason which was
discussed with the board...
...was that there was
not a profit seen to be...
..coming out of either
electric cars or hybrids.
They could not understand
how Toyota could possibly...
...make a profit
out of the PRIUS, for example.
They were gonna lose their shirt.
And as events have shown, I don't
think Toyota is losing their shirt.
If loss of revenue worried
car companies, then the...
...electric car posed
another problem altogether:
It had no internal combustion engine,
the cornerstone of the auto industry.
These parts represent a large
part of a dealership's income...
...through the replacement
and the maintenance.
Essentially this group of parts is a
visual representation of the profits...
...that the auto
industry doesn't make...
...when they sell an
EV1 or any EV en general.
I can actually identify
a lot of these...
...that didn't get
used on the EV1 program.
Oil filters you need 4 times a year.
That was probably the
most prominent thing...
...along with the several
quarts of oil every time.
I didn't enjoy working on the
internal combustion engine,
just due to the
fact you got so dirty.
And working on an EV1, I basically
go home looking like this.
Servicing the EV1 was pretty simple.
It came in about every 5000 miles.
We put it in the air,
we rotate the tires,
add washer fluid to it and
send it back out on the street.
It's amazing, look how dirty I've
gotten just by handling this stuff.
It's kind of sad.
In order to sincerely
market a clean car,
you have to suggest that
your core product is dirty.
And that it uses oil and
that it uses gas and...
...that it increases our
dependence on foreign oil...
...and here's this product that doesn't.
It looks very schizophrenic
but I think when it started...
...we could show the
people in California...
...we can meet the
Zero-Emission requirements...
...and later on said "Do we want
to show them, that we can meet?"
That means all of our other cars...
But the more it caught on, the
more that there is this dichotomy...
...between clean and
efficient and non-polluting...
...versus a SUBURBAN.
Car companies had
convinced themselves...
...that they could not make money in
the short term with the electric car.
In order to to that, they would
need an entirely different vehicle.
General Motors made a
commitment to the Hummer.
Because they could see the
Hummer would make them money.
When the SUV's first came out,
people were like "I can't drive that!"
That big old thing! - That's a
tank!  - I can't see out of that-
I'm gonna murder somebody in
that. That's too big for me.
But they convinced people:
- This is safer -
- you need this car -
- you need a big car -
- you need this for your family -
The idea of a penny-pinching
EV1 that was super-green...
...you know, that didn't
get a lot of traction,
whereas the idea that gigantic
SUV that would crush your neighbor,
that did get a lot of traction.
Basically that tells us
what the 90's was about.
What began as a $25.000
dollar tax break...
...grew to a $100.000 dollars...
...when Congress passed the President's
economic stimulus package last spring.
We think small
businesses need to have...
...support at this time
to keep them afloat,
to keep the economy moving ahead.
But there is an encouragement
for the small business person,
...not just to stay afloat but to go
buy the biggest gas guzzler there is.
The 6.000 pound car, the
biggest. Does that make sense?
I don't think we can dictate
what vehicles people buy.
I think the goal here is...
This is encouraging them.
You can almost buy the
whole car for the tax break.
Well, I'm not gonna
concede that that would...
...be the way these
would be used or that...
Well, there's some evidence
that is how they're being used.
Well, I don't know. We'll have
to wait and see what happens.
One month later, GM closed its EV1
Assembly Line in Lansing, Michigan
I don't wanna see Hummers driven
off the market by the government.
I wanna see everything
given a level equal chance.
The thing that bothers me is that in
fact it's not a level equal chance.
We're using our military
to ensure the flow of oil.
We're using tax dollars to support
the car companies in different ways...
...and we're not using
our tax money to...
...do the things that
we really need to do...
...to prepare for the future.
Federal policy has always had
tremendous power to shape the future.
As it gave enormous
incentives to buy SUVs,
the federal government also sued
California to stop the electric car.
Some pointed to the influence
of the oil and auto industries.
They control things in Washington
- they and the automobile industry.
Now they've got Andy Card,
their former lobbyist right there
as chief of staff of the White House.
And I guess they don't have
to pay lobbyist any more...
...and so they save
a little money there.
Andrew Card was chief
of staff when the Bush...
...Administration joined
the suit against California.
Card had also been
President and CEO of the...
...American Automobile
Manufacturers Association...
...during its campaign to kill
California's electric car mandate.
Industries began to see if we
don't kill this cancer in California...
...it's going to spread
to the rest of the country.
And I think it became
a strategy on the part...
...of many companies to
make it a national issue.
I was even told once
by a very prominent...
...congressman who I shall
not mention by name...
...that "I can understand and tolerate
what you're doing in California,
...but if you ever try to
spread your California...
...program to the rest of my country,
I'm going to have to
do battle with you."
Sometimes I listen to
the energy debate...
...and I think I'm
watching an old movie...
...that was made back in the 70's...
...because the discussion is exactly...
...the same as it was 30 years ago.
Our average vehicle, average car
on the road is less efficient...
...than it was 20 years ago.
And this is just the
complete abdication...
...of leadership, political
leadership, really...
...because it's impossible
to get fuel economy...
...standards passed
through the US Congress.
After the OPEC oil
embargo in the 1970's,
the US government created
Corporate Average Fuel Economy...
...or CAFE standards, to improve
fuel economy in American vehicles.
As a result in less than 10 years,
fuel economy increased
by more than 50 percent.
Unfortunately, two decades later,
there is been virtually no change.
Jimmy Carter was the
last President that...
...really made energy a high priority,
...and he devoted his
first 90 days in office...
...to putting together an energy plan.
I was there as part of
it, and no President...
...since then has put that
kind of effort into it.
I am tonight, setting a clear goal for
the energy policy of the United States.
Beginning this moment,
this nation will never use...
...more foreign oil than we did in 1977.
Never.
There was just a radical change
when Ronald Reagan came in...
...and took down the solar
panels off the White House roof...
...that Jimmy had put up and
essentially declared war on the sun.
I put a freeze on
pending regulations and...
...set up a task force
under Vice President Bush...
...to review regulations with an eye...
...toward getting rid
of as many as possible.
I have decontrolled oil...
...which should result in
more domestic production...
...and less dependence on foreign oil.
When Reagan came in he
was not a supporter...
...of fuel economy, of
conservation, of renewables.
And in the mid 1980's he
basically stopped any...
...improvements in fuel
economy standard for cars.
And then in 1985 the
price of oil collapsed.
I would not lay all of the blame at
Ronald Reagan's feet, by any means.
I think he had his share of
responsibility. But so did the Saudis,
who made the very
calculating decision...
...to drop the price
of oil dramatically.
Principally to ensure that none
of these alternative fuels...
...and energy saving measures...
...really produced the desired results.
So, they kept the junkie
hooked up, in other words.
And as a result we are
today still addicted to oil.
When Clinton came in,
and I worked for Clinton,
we were definitely quite interested...
...in trying to come
up with alternatives...
...and improve the fuel
economy of the fleet.
Politically it was
still very unattractive.
The automobile lobby was
quite powerful then,
so the administration kind of made a
bargain with the automobile companies,
this partnership for a
new generation of vehicles,
where we would develop hybrid vehicles,
a combination of the gasoline
engine and electric drive train.
In return, we wouldn't really
pursue fuel economy standards.
I never met a 5 year old
kid like this in my life.
And when I shook hands with him he said,
"I'm glad to meet you Mr. President.
I want you to make a car
that runs on electricity...
...and doesn't pollute the air."
Well, I was so impressed,
I went to get Al Gore...
...and I introduced him to
this 5 year old boy and he said,
"Hello Mr. Vice-President,
I intend to spend my
life working on this"...
...and he said, "I am
going to help you...
...develop an electric
car that has no pollution."
And he, Al Gore says, "That
means we're gonna be partners."
He said, "Yes, I guess so,
but you don't understand, I'm going
to spend my whole life on this."
For 8-9 years we spent
about a billion dollars of...
...the taxpayers' money
to develop hybrid vehicles.
And ironically the US car companies
didn't put any hybrids on the road...
...and in fact the minute George
Bush got elected president,
the US car companies walked
away from hybrids, but...
...and this is the irony,
the US program got the
Japanese very nervous.
So Toyota and Honda, in
response, developed hybrids...
...because they didn't
want to be beaten by the US.
And now they lure people into
thinking they're doing something...
...by their sweet talk, but...
...I remember way back
yonder, they used to...
...have this joke, and
it's not a joke anymore.
We give the environmentalists the
music and the industry the action.
The second step to make America
less dependent on foreign oil...
...is to produce and refine
more crude oil here...
at home in environmentally
sensitive ways.
By far the most promising
site for oil in America,
is the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
While it is predicted that the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge...
...could supply America with slightly
more than one year's supply of oil,
simply raising fuel economy
standards to 40 miles per gallon...
...could save the same amount
of fuel within 15 years.
The oil industry and the automobile
companies are resistant to change.
The American people need
to be reminded that...
...it took a law to get
seat belts in the cars.
It took a law to get
airbags in the cars.
It took a law to get the mileage
up from 12 to 20 miles per gallon.
It took a law to get catalytic
converters to control the pollution.
And I think clean cars are too important...
...to be left to the
automobile industry.
The California mandate forced
automakers to make electric cars.
When California changed
it, the cars vanished.
Why did California retreat
from the bold law it created?
Having visited all the car
companies, they were saying,
"Well look, we can't
produce these increasing...
...numbers of the battery
electric vehicles."
And I became convinced that what
are we supposed to do here...
...is it our job to clean the air?
Or is it to force a certain number of...
...type of technology on the road?
Alan Lloyd failed in
his leadership to...
...really steer the
Zero-Emission vehicle mandate...
...toward a successful outcome.
Oh, I know Alec very
well. I know Alec very well...
...and we had some
heart-felt memos going back...
...and it pained me. Because I
have the utmost respect for Alec.
And it really pained
me to be accused of...
...basically abandoning
the battery electrics.
In addition to his role as
Chairman of the Air Resources Board,
Alan Lloyd had another position.
Just 4 months before the meeting
that killed the electric car,
Lloyd accepted the chairmanship of
the California Fuel Cell Partnership.
I have been involved with
hydrogen since the early 90's.
When I became chair
of ARB 10 years later,
I knew a lot about hydrogen.
So, for me, I'm very much
fact-technology-driven.
And so maybe you can
say that's an asset...
...or a handicap in
the terms of hydrogen...
...because I knew what could be done.
Excuse me here while I watch
my little baby get off here.
Car makers convinced California...
...that the facts supported the...
...development of hydrogen
fuel cell vehicles.
Were they a better
option than electric cars?
Toyota's national manager of
advanced technologies, Bill Reinert,
took their prototype Hydrogen
Fuel Cell SUV on a press tour.
One of our customers
really didn't like...
...this car anywhere
near as much as his EV1.
And the reason was not because
it had anything bad about the car,
the reason was because his
EV1, he could charge it at home,
charge it at work,
and even though it
provided limited range...
he didn't have to worry about
getting his car charged up.
With this car, with the limited
access to hydrogen filling stations...
...he said he spent his
whole day planning...
...how to get hydrogen in
the car and how to get back.
It's really humbling.
The more you know, the more you
realize you really don't know...
...what the issues are
gonna be going forward.
The number 1 worst question is,
"When will that be on the market?"
When will that be on the market?
That's the worst question.
Consumers are probably
gonna want to know,
how long it will be for
this to be mass produced.
That's quite a way off.
We've got some road technical issues...
...we've got to solve
with hydrogen storage,
with durability, with cost reduction.
Is it a practical
solution at this point?
The cars have a limited range,
the durability of the
cars isn't very good...
and, let me see what else, they
don't do well in cold weather.
Other than that, they're great.
Have you ever been to a dog race,
you know, there's the
mechanical rabbit...
that's out in front, and the
dogs never quite reach it.
Well, the fuel cell is the
equivalent of that mechanical rabbit.
We're going for it.
For the last 15 years...
...they've been telling us, the
fuel cells are 10 to 15 years off.
You're an oil company. Your
business is to be selling a fuel.
They think that it's a
long time off, 30 years...
...and they want to
have a product to sell.
So from that point they're
protecting themselves,
but the other side is they're
protecting the status quo.
We see in Scientific American
a double-page ad by...
...General Motors and Shell, both...
...touting both the fuel cell that
General Motors is doing and also...
Shell as a potential
supplier of hydrogen.
If Hydrogen can do a better
job as an energy carrier,
than electricity, then by gosh,
it should be the carrier of choice.
The problem is, it's not even close.
How far will this car drive
on that amount of fuel?
It gives approximately
about maybe a 100, 125 miles.
Good. Interesting.
A fuel cell car powered by
hydrogen made with electricity...
...uses 3 to 4 times more energy
than a car powered by batteries.
This is the beginning of some
fantastic technology and...
...thanks for having us out here.
We gonna get some other
vehicles in a minute.
Hydrogen is the way to the future.
Today there is a lot a enthusiasm
for hydrogen cars. But...
...you know, I wrote a whole book,
"The Hype About Hydrogen", I
think it's pretty clear that...
...hydrogen is a much tougher
alternative fuel than...
...any other alternative
fuel we've ever pursued.
So, these are the 5
miracles that you need...
...to make a successful
hydrogen car in the marketplace.
First, your average hydrogen
car costs a million dollars.
That's gotta drop.
Second, no known
material to humankind...
...can store enough
hydrogen on board the car...
...to give you the range people want.
Miracle No.3 is the
fuel is wildly expensive.
Even hydrogen from dirty
fossil fuels, is two or...
...three times more
expensive than gasoline.
Fourth, you have to have
the fueling infrastructure.
You know, we have a
180.000 gas stations.
Someone is gonna have
to build at least...
...10 or 20.000 hydrogen
fueling stations...
...before anybody is
gonna be very interested.
And miracle 5 is, you
have to hope and pray...
...that the competitors
in the marketplace...
...don't get any better.
Because right now, the best car in
the marketplace just got a lot better,
The Hybrid Vehicle.
Still runs on gasoline.
You can fuel it everywhere.
It has twice the range of a regular car.
Current hybrid vehicles
depend on gasoline...
...but use an electric motor
to increase their fuel economy.
And if battery technology
keeps getting steadily better,
then the best hybrid and then
plug-in hybrid in the year 2020...
...will be vastly superior...
...to the best hydrogen car.
You guys have filmed me
long enough to know...
...that I like to hear
myself talk No.1...
...and No. 2 that I'm not
gonna dance around the issue.
And these could be a long
ways out into the future.
Toyota says, fuel cell
cars, 30 years away, ok.
Then I get the calls from the DoE...
...and the state of California...
"what in the hell are you doing?" And
all the other fuel cell manufacturers...
"...we're trying to
make a living here...
...and you're saying this and..."
It's awful.
Just because a lot of people want
it to work, it's no guarantee.
That's Disneyland you know,
wishing makes it come true.
So, I don't work in Disneyland,
I work in the real world...
...where wishing doesn't
make it come true...
...and you really got to work
hard to make it come true.
Hopefully we do.
On the 27th day of their vigil,
activists finally heard from GM.
Paul Scott calls, "Are you guys busy?
They're calling in the cars right now.
And GM is loading the
cars on trucks right now."
We're like, "What,
what? Yeah. Well, drop...
...everything, run on
down there right now."
GM media blast is going now...
Ok!
Both are closed.
They loaded them up, you
know. Tires screeching...
...and panels cracking
against each other...
...as they shoved them onto the trucks.
We're up against most of
the money in the world.
We're up against the oil
industry, the automobile industry.
It's David versus
Goliath, in a very big way.
But if there're enough Davids
in the world, we can win.
<i>GM
- SHAME ON YOU!</i>
Save EV1s. General Motors is
sneaking the EV1s out of here.
Destroying them. Doing the work
of the oil companies...
Get out of those trucks!
What we gonna ask you guys, is just to
give us maybe just to the grass there.
If you just get out
of the driveway for us,
so we don't have to put
any hands on anybody.
Thank you!
Don't crush the EV1!
On March 15, 2005,
the last EV1s in the Burbank lot
were taken away and destroyed.
Alright. Well, come on in! - Cool!
We'll go down to the vault
and I'll show you the car.
Yeah! I miss this little car.
Yeah. We love having it.
We have a number of electric vehicles
in the collection and hybrids,
but we're specially happy about this.
This is the special one.
There she is!
My baby!
Number 99.
You might recognize this car.
- I do! It was Chris's car.
Sure was!
Please! Have a seat!
There's only one challenge:
it doesn't start up.
Well, you know that General
Motors disabled them.
I know.
We wish they didn't, but they had to.
So we understand that.
We're just happy to have it.
Yeah!
It is such an important
part of automotive history.
- It is except-
Have a manufacturer
like General Motors..
participate in this program.
It's wonderful.
The thing is, it shouldn't be
a part of automotive history.
Ever since 1939, they would
dangle this electric car...
...and they have a few
models out there, they'd say...
...there's something
in another few years...
...and it never came,
...because they never
intended it to come.
They make too much money...
...with their technological stagnation
and the internal combustion engine.
If something becomes
scarce then there's...
...economic pressures
to find alternatives.
And as long as no
alternatives exist, these...
...scarce item can become
increasingly profitable.
These are the same batteries
you're using in your laptop-computer.
And we have 6.800 cells.
And it can go 300
miles from one charge...
...running about 70 miles an hour.
And how 'bout zero to 60 in 3.6 seconds.
So it's amazing performance for
any car, not just an electric car.
Those same batteries
can be put into an EV1...
...and make it a 300 mile
range car very easily.
So it's such a shame seeing these cars
destroyed when you could upgrade them.
I know what I did and why I did it.
And if I had to do the same
thing again based on the data,
and I've seen what's happened to date...
I would do exactly the same thing.
For most Americans when we talk
about sensible energy policy,
What most people hear is, "You're
gonna make me drive a small car,
you're gonna make me keep my house cold,
and essentially make me
live like a European."
It's a lack of leadership, it's a lack...
...of being able of take
on the oil industry...
...and the automobile industry and...
...recognize that
they're not "Uncle Sam"...
"Uncle Sam" has to be "Uncle Sam"...
...and "Uncle Sam" is acting
like they're General Motors.
They're squandering
huge amounts of money...
...on hydrogen cars which
by any reasonable estimate...
...are not gonna be selling
in the consumer market...
...for 2 decades at the earliest.
And I think it will go down as
one of the biggest blunders...
...in the history of
the automotive industry.
Have you never heard that expression:
Death by a million
cuts, little tiny cuts.
Eventually someone will bleed to death.
The fight over electric cars was
quite simply a fight about the future.
Goliath won this round but
now Goliath has new problems.
Oil prices have soared.
America is further
entangled in the Middle East.
And global warming is an
increasingly serious threat.
What can we do to reshape the future?
This city is replete with...
...famous names that are no longer here.
Why? Because it
couldn't adapt to change.
We all have to adapt to change.
Don't debate about who's
to blame or what to blame.
Let's build new industries.
Let's make America strong again.
Chelsea continues her work with a
new group called "Plug In America"...
...working with citizens
across the political...
...spectrum to promote an
independent energy future.
You know, I met Jim Woolsey at
an event and as it turns out...
...he was already a bit of a fan
of the stuff that we were doing...
...and he's come to work
with "Plug In America".
That's one example of the types of
relationships that have to exist...
...in order to further what we all want.
I've served in 4 administrations
in presidential appointments...
...all in different aspects
of national security.
And the fact that 2/3 of the
world's proven reserves of oil...
...are in the Middle East and we are so
dependent of that part of the world...
...is a very big national
security question.
Well, behind me there are two things:
One is a PRIUS, hybrid
gasoline electric Toyota...
...and an electrical substation.
Today they don't have much
to do with one another...
...but there is a chance...
...that they might be
able to have something...
...to do with one
another in a positive way.
And that's where I think the plug-in
hybrid is the natural next step.
And it is available to us today.
This is a Plug-in Hybrid PRIUS,
which is a modification to a normal
Toyota PRIUS that allows you to travel,
which gives you up to
150, 180 miles per gallon...
...for the first 50
to 60 miles of the day.
We don't need an expensive charging
infrastructure to use this car.
You can just plug it
anywhere in your garage.
So we make the environmentalists
happy because its cleaner.
We make the neo-conservatives
happy because it uses less gasoline.
Or everyone's happy because
it uses less gasoline.
Plugging-in could go a long way
to reducing our dependence on oil.
And generating that electricity
with the wind and the sun...
...would create even less pollution.
With his battery technology
in most hybrid cars,
Ovshinsky has also built
one of the largest...
...thin-film solar
factories in the world.
This is just an ordinary steel roof.
And this is with the adhesive.
You just put the shingles down,
nail them down. You're in
there. You run your wires down.
Everything is Plug and Play.
Anybody who wants to make a
revolution shouldn't grab a gun.
Let's go and start working
like we do to change the world...
...by using science and technology.
I'm so optimistic about the future.
I mean even given
everything that we've seen...
...and all the EV wars,
I remain an optimist.
One of the thing that
makes America work...
...is this ramping grassroots
agitation for things that are new.
You get a coalition of that size
and that surprising character...
...you get politicians attention.
And here we have a serious problem:
America is addicted to oil.
I call all this a potential coalition...
...between the
treehuggers, the do-gooders,
the sodbusters, the cheap-hawks
and the evangelicals.
That's a pretty good size coalition.
We're about to enter into a
world that's truly renewable...
...and completely clean...
...if we just had the
will power to implement it.
Well, you don't have to wait
for mayor auto companies,
you can do it yourself
like what I'm doing here.
Old cars, new cars, it doesn't
really matter. I can convert anything.
You haven't seen anything
yet. The future...
...is gonna be very bright in this area.
And the forces are all
pushing in that direction,
both the economic and
technological forces.
So, you know, once people
see these things they say:
"Wow, I wanna do this."
And so the word is getting out.
That gives us...
...hope.
Hope, that we can end up our lives...
...having achieved what we
set off to do and we have.
And you still have so many more
years you want to do things.
I won't have enough time.
I'm shooting with hot dice right now...
