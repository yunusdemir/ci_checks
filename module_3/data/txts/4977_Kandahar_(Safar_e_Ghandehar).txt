Now you need recommendation.
Will your father do that?
Let me try?
But the answer may be a big 'no'.
Yes.
You are Loknath Sharma's son.
Try to get a job without recommendation.
Drink tea.
- Thanks, papa.
Papa, why don't you understand
what l am saying?
For the last 30 years, this house and the
convent where you taught are your world.
Papa, you don't know what's happening
in the outside world. - Yes. Yes.
You don't know what's happening
in the outside world.
All sons will think in the
same way at this age.
When l was your age,
l too thought like that.
Drink tea.
Papa, my work will be done with
just a phone call of yours.
Papa, please do at least that for me.
You are my son.
That's why l won't do it.
l have faith in your capability.
You will make a good name for yourself.
Not like the one you make for yourself
by thrashing people everyday.
Father, l have traveled the path
which you have shown me.
But by seeing the situation here..
l am tired, papa.
No. Never use the word
tired in your life.
You need to look for an
opportunity to prove yourself.
Have faith in your capabilities.
Everything will be fine.
Did you feel bad hearing what l said?
No, papa. Never.
But you know, papa.
l feel that sometimes..
Whenever l do something good you
hold back in appreciating me.
And whenever l do something wrong you
are very generous with your criticism.
Yes, son. lt is true that whenever you did
something right l didn't appreciate it much.
And the reason behind it is my belief
that you can do much better.
But at the same time l also fear that
l may be casting an evil eye on you.
Look, son. Till now people know you
as Loknath Sharma's son.
l am waiting for the day..
..when people would look at me and say..
look, he is Surya's father.
This word 'tired'.. cowards use that word.
But not men like you.
Now you will have to choose between a brave
man's life or a coward's death. lt's up to you now.
You are right, papa.
l am so sorry.
l will never hurt you again.
No, no.. l am just saying..
Here it comes..
You may have to go now.
Papa, this is called new generation.
- Okay.
You are an old man.
Papa, you won't understand this.
How would l understand it?
l was born just yesterday.
Hey, l am coming.
Hey, listen. Keep this money.
Your purse is empty.
Papa, did you check my purse?
Yes. But l haven't seen the photo inside.
Fill petrol too. Tank is empty.
Papa. Papa, did you wash my bike today?
Yes. So what?
Let me do something.
Otherwise l will become an old man.
Oh, papa. You are the best.
Come on.
- l am so incomplete without you.
No flattery please. Go.
And stay away from trouble.
Okay? - Okay, papa.
- No fights.
Bye.
- Bye.
He is calling me an old man.
Am l old?
No. You are still young.
Come. Let's have tea.
l will wearjeans, a t-shirt
and a jacket. Come on.
Take. Keep this.
- For me?
Yes. For a long time you are saying
you don't have a mobile.
You keep it. lt's for you to call me.
- Thanks, brother.
Brother. What about taking me?
l will take you. Are you ready to come?
- Yes. l am ready.
l will come anywhere to make money.
- Now you have become a man.
But you haven't said
where we are going. Whatjob?
Scared? No need of that.
lt's not related to guns and bombs.
Struggling for our community.
Fighting against these people.
Your mother.
Don't tell anyone about this.
l will come after 2 days. - Okay.
- You take this bike.
Where were you?
Who was that?
From where did you get this
motor cycle and phone?
Don't ask everything together.
You will get suffocated.
l will get suffocated,
if you live like this.
That Kozhikode Jamal was
with you now, right?
Yes. So what?
Why did he come here from
Kozhikode along with you?
l don't know.
l read in the newspaper that he was behind
the riots in Kozhikode and Furoke.
l have brought you back from
your maman's house
to Ooty to avoid friendship
with people like him.
You won't give peace here too.
l have told you several times
don't roam with people like him.
No. l won't roam.
l will sit here itself.
Will you give me what l need?
- For that, you have to earn.
During your school days, you haven't
given importance to studying.
Now you want to become
rich immediately.
You are ashamed to go with
your father for selling fish.
Yes. lt's shameful for me.
l can't shout carrying
fish baskets on the cycle.
Now it's shameful work for you.
When you were a child,
you waited to sleep on your father's
chest which is carrying the smell of fish.
Thatjob is also having its own dignity.
Police never came here
in search of your father.
But the Jamal who came here
to see you now.
He will take money from others
and give the Quran in..
..your hand after tearing it
into 56 pieces.
Your father's fish smell has
more dignity than the..
..smell of that devil who
makes Muslims devils.
What happened here to say all this?
Son. Your mother is saying this.
You are not traveling on the right path.
This mother wants to tell you that only.
Hey, l don't get peace if l come home.
For making me mad.
Oh Father Namah.
Om workshop Namah.
Let all the vehicles come
here after accidents.
lf the owner dies, who will give me money?
Namah. Namah.
How is it?
Come. Come close to me.
- What?
Why did you hit me?
l told you never keep this
photo straight.
l am getting slaps for this
for the last 6 years.
This is your father's photo, right?
- Yes.
Why are you keeping this
picture facing the other way?
Earlier, l had kept this straight.
That time people asked me
whose photo this is?
l said my father's photo.
So they wouldn't give me work.
Then l kept it facing the other way.
That time people asked me if this was
my father's photo right? - Why?
Hey, When my father was under vehicles,
people used to see him head down, right?
How?
- Yes.
Yesterday also l explained and
slapped him. Today too.
What will l do tomorrow?
Hello, sir.
- Hello.
What happened?
- This is a headache. lt doesn't start.
Now start it. Kick,
lt started.
- lt didn't start by itself. You had to on this.
Oh my God.
Are you done?
- lt will take a little time.
Old hag, no matter what,
he can't stop eating this.
l'll only have to talk to him now.
- Give me the spanner.
Here,
- Will you shove it into my mouth?
God bless him. No matter how much
you tell him, he doesn't listen.
God knows what's on his mind.
Hey, go away from here.
Why are you troubling me?
ls this steamed bread delicious?
- Yes. lt is.
One has to eat only
steamed bread at this age.
ls there any vacancy for pilots?
- Yes. Yes.
Hey, Surya. Don't waste your
time reading the newspaper.
Go and tell your father to recommend.
- Good idea.
lt won't happen till his father is alive.
Hey. lf you say something about my father..
- What l said is true, right?
Leave him.
- Hey. What is this?
Leave it. You are a pilot, right?
You will surely get a job.
lf you won't get a job, then too your father
had made everything for your livelihood.
Who will give us jobs without
bribing and recommendation?
That's right?
lf this is the situation of
an educated person like you..
..then you see me.
l am not educated also.
But you see. l will also do something.
That l am seeing.
From where did you get all these?
That l will tell you when time comes.
Surya, come.
l want to go to the electricity office.
Can you drop me?
Electricity office?
Go in an auto rickshaw.
l have some other work.
- Job,
The planes in lndia won't fly
without you.
Don't make others say something.
Come. Come and start the bike. Come.
- Tell. Tell.
Hey, lf you don't go.
l will drop her.
Hey. What is this?
Move. Move.

Aishwarya. May l drop you?

Go, man.
That was nice. Nice.
Where are you taking me to?
l think you are taking me
to a very beautiful place.
l'm talking to you.
Surya, talk to me romantically please.
Get lost.
You want to create a love story?
You are talking as though you don't know
anything about my feelings.
Listen to me. Talk to me.
Think over it once again.
lf l go to Australia leaving you alone
here what will you do here?
Then you'll have to find
a girl for yourself here.
Surya, l don't understand why don't you
share your feelings with me?
Stop it now. You've been irritating me
with your talks since morning.
Surya, whatever l told was to
make you understand.
Surya, no.
Get. Down.
- Surya.
Surya, no.
Surya.
What? What happened? Get up.
They were misbehaving.

No. You will go to jail.
Hey,

Surya, what happened?
lt's going to rain. Go home.
l haven't bent my head in front of anyone
in my life except my father. Who is he?
That is Mahadevan sir.
A military officer.
Did you fight with anyone today?
What was the reason behind that?
That's okay.
l heard that you were angry with the
person who came to calm you down.
l don't know who he is.
Standing here after telling everything.
l will give you.
- You are going to marry me, right?
l decided to improve you before that.
Whatever you have done is right.
But you go and say thanks to the person
who saved you from going to jail.
Why should l say thanks for this?
Who is he? l will..
Why are you staring at her?
lf Aishwarya wouldn't have told me
then too l would have known about this.
Are you saying that
l started the fight there?
Papa, the police man who was thrashed
there was almost your age.
But l can understand that
what you have done is right.
But lots of people were there, right?
Then why did you go to fight alone?
Papa, you told me that wherever
l see a mistake, l should question it.
l have done that only.
Okay. Okay. Do one thing.
Go and say sorry to him.
Go. Go. Please.
What will you do after marrying him?
He is mad.
Whatever he does, he is a nice man.
- That's right.
After all he is my son.
Bravo,
Come on.

Why did you come here?
For beating me?
Sir, l..

Okay.
You know, officer.
We soldiers have planted more
that 4 crores trees.
Why can't you plant trees instead
of showing goon behavior?
Sir, please. l am not a goon, sir.
Then what did l see in the market?
Sir, like you think..
- Like l think..
l am not a rowdy like you think.
l am a highly qualified,
unemployed, frustrated..
..young man who is following
the path of true worthiness..
..which my father has taught me.
But you forgot one thing.
- Sir.
Your father is a great teacher
who has contributed lots of..
..great people for our country
in the last 40 years.
Mr. Loknath Sharma.
- Sir, do you know my father?
Who doesn't know a person
like him in Ooty?
But now people know you too.
But as a goon.
Actually l came here to tell you.
Thanks? You came here as per
your father's instructions right?
Yes, sir.
lf you hadn't come there,
l would have killed that rowdy.
Sir, forgive me.
l have behaved badly with you.
Sorry, sir.
lt's okay.
lf you do like this, then that man who is
sitting at home won't get peace of mind.
l know. He is a different person.
l know that. Sir.
l am a son who is following
his principles.
lf l do something good,
then too his heart pains.
Do you like your father so much?
l love my father very much.
One of the best fathers in the world.
l have to do something for
his happiness.
And l want to make him proud of me.
The courage and strength of people like

Use that for the benefit of your country.
Then this country will felicitate you.
Especially your father.
Why don't you join the army?
Sir, l am ready. l tried twice.
But l never got it.
You liked to become a pilot, right?
Nothing like that, sir.

Are you ready to join the army?

To holy war of Allah.
My Allah,
Enough, son. This mother doesn't

What l feared about my son,
at last that itself has happened.
Nabi stood peacefully when his
uncle Shahid Ali died in
The war front and when his liver
was bitten by a prostitute.
And when lslam came to Arabia.
He pardoned them and showed
the strength of lslam to them.
lslam should follow him and
not go forjihaad like this.
They are really the enemies
of both lslam and the world.
You mother is saying this.
You are going to hell.
l will tolerate that hell.
l need money and status.
ls it possible for you to give that?
No, right?

No religious feelings.
Only one feeling. l am an lndian.
That's all.
Here somebody will say bad words to you.
Punish you.
That's all a part of training.
Tomorrow our enemy would capture you.
You don't go against our country by

We failed twice.
Take as much money as you want.
But we want Mr. Masood at any cost.
- Okay.
Bin Laden will get very angry.
By God's grace, you will get everything.
What's her crime?
She went against lslam and
got herself treated by a doctor.
She's not scared of God.
She confessed her crime.
That's our camp.
She might have done any thing
against lslam.
She might have consulted
a doctor for illness.
Today Omar will give her punishment.
Court and police are not here or what?
Here Omar is the police and court.
Nothing less than death penalty would
be enough for such women.

The one who doesn't have any respect for lslam
and Taliban doesn't have a right to live.
Take her to Shaitan hills and
eliminate her.
That is not my problem.

Masood is imprisoned in lndia.
Yes.

Now you are adding to our miseries?
Come on. Let's go from here.
You have cheated me. Right, Jamal?

God won't forgive you.

People like you whose mind changed

After father's death, for conducting the marriage
of my four sisters, l took up this job.
l know that what l am doing
is against lslam.
l am doing all this because
of my situation.
Let's run away from here, Jamal.
lf l go alone, then it won't be a problem.
lf l take you along with me,
they will find and kill us.
Anyway, you calm down.
They will send us to Kashmir shortly.
You can escape from there.

He is a dirty fellow, sir.

His father, Loknath Sharma is

He was worried about his son.
When l meet him, you will tell him

Tomorrow morning, l want a resignation.

Sir, please. Understand my feelings, sir.
Please, sir. Please. Please.
Shamim Khan will take Surya with him.

We are working on it since five years.
Give us some more time.
With Allah's blessings we will
celebrate the next Eid together.
Alright. Goodbye.
Dear.. See this.

l have worn the dress of your choice.
My choice, the best choice.
And what about me?
Am l not your choice?
l get reprimanded by you every time.
Surya's training is over.
He will be coming home soon.
l talked to him yesterday itself.
He was happy.
Oh God, Dear, see who it is.
- Okay.
Who is it?
Yes?
Mr. Loknath Sharma.
- Yes.
Major Mahadevan.
- Good morning, sir.
No, sir. You can call me Mahi.
Please come. Please come.
Mahi. Nice name.
Mahi, shortcut of Mahadevan.
Army men are experts in shortening names.
Padmanabham turns into Paddy.
Madhavan becomes Maddy.
lf l were in the army what would
have my name been?
Loknath Sharma.
Lauki?
What will we call that in Malayalam?
Nice fellow.
You speak Malayalam, sir.
- Yes. l know Malayalam.
l am living with Malayali.
l have to know it.
l don't speak too much. Just a bit.
When l speak too much
she laughs at me.
Please sit down.
- Sir, you are a joyful person.
Joyful?
lf l was not a joyful person it would've
been difficult to spend life alone.
Be happy. Live happily.
Alone?
But you were talking to someone here.
- Talking?
l see.
So you have heard my madness.
That's my madness.
l talk to her about everything.
We fight.
We disagree. We have arguments.
And she even answers me back.
You can call it my madness, major.
But because of this particular
madness l am not lonely today.
Look, major, in life..
Only after people leave us
we know their real value.
But till then it's already too late.
Anyway, you won't understand it, sir.
l understand it very well.
- No, you won't..
Yes, sir. Because l lost
my wife and daughter.
Oh,
l am so sorry, officer.
You know how much l miss my wife
and Surya misses his mother?
No, sir. Surya is not missing her.
How do you know that?
Surya talked to me about you only.
Surya never talked about his mother.
l realized from his talk that you never allowed
him to feel that his mother is not alive.
l always had the fear that..
Surya shouldn't miss his mother.
Anyway, now you know everything.
Okay, please come in. Sit down.
l will make tea for you.
And l make good tea.
l brought tea leaves for you.
l see.
Surya must've told you about it.
Sir..
- Alright, sit down.
Nice tea.
Sir, may l help you.
- No. No. - Okay.
l will prepare the tea myself.
l like making it.
When Surya was here he used
to bring tea for me.
He is a.. he is a good boy.
Surya, you know..
He must've done something
good in his life.
l never patted on his back.
l don't know why.
l hope he will become a good officer.
He shall be a good officer, sir.
- Yes.
You are not going to attend his
passing out ceremony, sir?
No, no. l don't leave Sumangali
here alone..
Let him come. Let Surya come.
Then l will salute him.
Okay. Okay, sir.
Did you like it?
After a long time l am having
a good cup of tea.
You make really good tea.
l am happy you liked it.
She too used to like my tea a lot.
She was always obstinate that she won't
drink tea unless l prepare it.
After meeting you
l feel like you are family.
l too feel the same way.
When l met Surya and
heard about you..
l wanted to meet you, sir.
l don't remember my father.
Sir, you..
Even after losing your wife,
you lived for your son.
You brought him up.
A good human being for the society.
l wish l had a father like you, sir.
Hey, army man.
Getting emotional.
Army men are also human beings.
We also have a heart inside.
Okay. Let me go now, sir.
Thank you.- Thank you so much
for coming and meeting me.
Say hi to Surya.

some NSG commandos entered the hijacked
plane Al-166 that landed in New Delhi for fuel.
After a brief round of firing with the hijackers
they got the plane in their control.
But the lndian government

A soldier doesn't get respect
when he is alive.
But after death, he can't see the
respect which the country gives him.
The respect which the
country gives to brave..
..soldiers like Surya who die
for the country is an..
..inspiration for soldiers like us
who are alive.

your son whom l had taken from you alive.

You know my son was nothing.
You took him away from here and
brought him back as a national hero.

..known as Surya's father.
My son fulfilled my wish.
He fulfilled a son's dharma.
By sacrificing his life unfortunately.
You are suppressing your pain.
Bring it out, sir. Bring it out.
No.
No, major. No.
No.
l don't want to insult my son's sacrifice
with my tears.
l don't want to disgust him
with my tears.
l.. l will handle myself.
But how do l tell his mother
that her son is no more?
Don't ever tell her that, sir.
l will have to tell her that, major.
l will have to tell her that.
- No, sir.
Don't tell her that ever.
Do you remember once you told me..
..not to miss my father?
Then how can you say that
your son is not alive?
Don't ever feel that way.
This son of yours is alive.
''Motherland..''
''..l dedicate my life..'' ''..to you.''
God bless you my son.
Thank you.
- God bless you.
l want to ask something, Mahi.
When he died, was there
any fear on his face?
