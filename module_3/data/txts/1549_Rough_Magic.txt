Clearance for act two.
Thanks, Cal.
Ladies and gentleman,
welcome back to our celebration
of the magical and the macabre!
The next part of tonight's performance
is not for those of a weak constitution.
If you are easily shocked,
or prone to nightmares,
I highly recommend you leave
the theatre immediately.
You have been warned.
Now, I require a volunteer.
Somebody brave or, failing that...
..foolish.
Please look under your seats!
There's no way I'm getting on
stage with that pompous prat.
Here!
Do we have a volunteer?
- Yep.
- Yes, madam.
Please. She looks nervous!
How about a round of applause?
A little more encouragement,
please, ladies and gentlemen.
If you'd like to come with me.
Please don't tell me your name.
I don't want to become emotionally
attached, just in case.
Now, I would like to introduce you all
to a woman close to my heart.
I call her...
..the Iron Maiden!
For those of you who think
these spikes are fake...
Solid metal.
Please.
Try to relax.
Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen.
I have no doubt she will find this
to be a transformative experience.
Jill?
Jill, you OK?
Look, there's blood!
Look.
Do I have to?
We should be doing this!
- What, gurning?
- Publicising!
What for?
Look, what, let me think...
Because we've got no clients!
Not true! What about
that identity theft case?
Oh, he called up to cancel.
Turns out it was his sister, only
she thought he was dead and...
It's a long story.
Well, don't worry about it,
something will turn up.
- It always does.
- Hope so, cos you've got more bills than a duck pond.
Chester Patterson is our main competition.
He is a fake!
He used to sell overpriced
wine for a living, eh.
I mean, what kind of PI puts
his own face on a flyer?
I'm twice the detective he'll ever be!
Well, if that's the case,
how come he's opening
a new swanky office down the road
and we are just stood here,
I'm just stood here eating doughnuts?
Because, unlike Mr Chester Patterson,
I have integrity.
Says a man in a fake leather jacket.
Hey, this is real. Smell it.
Either way, integrity won't
pay the bills, will it?
If we're so much better than
him, then that's great!
That is brilliant. Let's shout about it.
Let's tell everyone.
All right. And how we going to do that?
As you can see, these chains are very real
and very... strong.
I'm starting the stopwatch...
..now!
His record is 13 seconds.
It's not that interesting. Let's go.
Of course, he's not performed
this particular trick in a while.
Won't be long now.
One final lock...
Ta-da!
"To be or not to be, that is the question."
"Whether 'tis nobler
of the mind to suffer."
"The slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune, or..."
I am fortune's fool.
"against a sea of troubles."
"And, by opposing, end them."
Don't give up, Dad.
You just need to get your mojo back.
Why?
So I can do card tricks
with the other lags?
"Involuntary manslaughter
by gross negligence."
But... it was an accident!
You have to fight this.
A woman died.
It was my fault.
You've done the Iron Maiden
trick a thousand times.
You checked it and double-checked it.
It's safe.
It's clearly not.
For my opening night at
the Terranova tomorrow.
Show there are no hard feelings.
What if it wasn't an accident?
"Choose Shakespeare and Hathaway,
because the other guy's a pillock"?
- Could you please take this seriously?
- I am!
No, you're not, you can't be writing...
Dear Lord, please let these clients
be affluent, desperate and suggestible...
- So much for integrity.
- And thank you for the doughnuts.
- I brought you the doughnuts.
- The Lord works in mysterious ways.
Come in.
Mr and Miss Pross.
- They want to employ our services.
- Hi. Hi.
Hang on, aren't you that magician?
Yes! Yes! The Great Prossini!
I saw your show a couple of years ago.
It's just... It was brilliant.
Lawrence will suffice.
This is my daughter, and assistant, Maggie.
- Please.
- Yes. Yeah.
Are you here about what
happened to that woman?
- I heard about it on the news.
- We believe the trick was sabotaged.
- By?
- Anton Dukes.
AKA The Amazing Antonio.
- He was there that night.
- Another magician?
Hardly! He calls himself an
"experimental illusionist".
He's been stealing my tricks for years.
And you think Mr Dukes caused
the fatality in order to...?
Destroy Dad's career.
Anton's taken over our spot at the theatre.
The last few weeks have been a nightmare.
We've been spat at in the street.
Our van's been vandalised.
They even broke off my aerial
and threw it into a tree.
Dad's being charged with manslaughter.
He could go to jail.
You've got to help us.
Why don't we put the kettle on
and you can tell us all about it?
Sebastian?
Starting with how the
trick's supposed to work.
That's not possible.
The Magic Circle have...
Have already kicked you out.
Just tell them, Dad.
It's easier if I show you.
Yes.
Yeah.
Just calm down.
Stratford's greatest con artist.
Callum!
Erm, Maggie, how've you been?
Who are they?
They're going to clear Dad's name.
Right.
I suppose you better come in then.
The police took the real Iron Maiden away
but we can use these trunks.
Excuse me! Mr Pross?
Iris! How lovely to see you.
You too, Mr Pross, but you're not
really allowed to be in here.
- My manager said you're...
- Barred. I'm aware.
Iris, these kind people
are helping us discover
what happened to that poor woman.
I would consider it a great favour
if you would turn a blind eye.
We won't be long.
OK.
Just while my manager's on lunch.
You're an angel.
So, we bring the volunteer up onstage.
Hooray!
Sorry, how is that person chosen?
I put a joker under one of the
seats during the interval.
So, you don't know who it
is until they come onstage?
No. I just pick a random seat.
I position the volunteer.
Please stand in here...
..and try to relax.
Now, on the underside of this
front section is a strong magnet.
When the device passes this point,
the magnet breaks a circuit,
opens the trap door,
the volunteer disappears
into the trap room,
a spring mechanism pushes the
trap door back into place
just before the Iron Maiden closes.
I wait downstairs to make
sure they're all right
and then I just bring them
up after the trick's over.
What, is that it?
Oh!
Then I do a bit more spiel...
..and Maggie emerges
from a secret compartment
behind the spikes,
resplendent in sequins.
Is it not possible that maybe the
trap door just jammed by itself?
No, I do a safety check every
night before the second half.
A power-cut?
If the power goes, the latch opens.
That's how it works.
But surely the police would've
noticed if it'd been tampered with.
Not if Anton removed any evidence.
So, you're saying that this Anton guy -
from his seat,
somewhere in the auditorium -
managed to jam the trap door shut
and then un-jam it, but during the
show, without anybody noticing.
He's a magician, isn't he?
Well, you got your wish.
"Desperate, affluent and suggestible."
Although I don't really feel like
there's much of a case here.
I feel like they just can't
accept that The Great Prossini
might have messed up.
No, I'm not so sure.
Really?
I do think he quite liked a bit of a drink.
I mean, really, would you
put your life in his hands?
Francis!
Long time, no see.
- Not long enough.
- Francis?
Chester. You're looking... well.
And you must be Ms Shakespeare.
I heard Francis had got himself
a glamorous new assistant.
I'm his partner.
Business partner.
He's a lucky man.
Chester Patterson.
Sure you've heard of Chester
Patterson's Investigations.
This is my client, Mr Shiplake.
Mr Shiplake? Your wife was...
Murdered by that maniac? Yes.
Our condolences.
And we intend to sue Mr Pross
for every penny he has.
I'm helping Mr Shiplake build a case
for a private compensation claim.
Excuse me, I have to take this.
We... We have reason to believe
there might be a third party involved.
And what reason is that?
Well, I'm not at liberty to say.
So, wait, you're working
for The Great Prossini?
Might be.
That's priceless! I've looked
into the incident, Francis.
If you think it was foul
play, you're wrong.
Well, do you want to put your
money where your mouth is then?
- You want to make a wager?!
- Excuse us.
- What are you doing?!
- I'm doing what you said.
Trying to prove we're the best in town.
No! This is not what I meant.
Listen to your hairdresser, Francis.
Sounds like what she lacks in expertise
she makes up for in female intuition.
Two days.
Two days.
And if we haven't proved that
Pross is innocent by then,
then Frank and I will spend an entire day
handing out your flyers.
And if you succeed?
I was talking about 20 quid,
not humiliating myself in public
promoting our biggest rivals.
So, I got carried away!
As long as we solve the case,
it doesn't matter, does it?
And we are the best, remember?
All right!
Listen, I want you to go back to the office
and run those background checks,
and talk to the daughter again.
But on her own this time. She might
open up if her dad's not there.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to deal with this.
Good luck. SHE LAUGHS.
Well, well, if it isn't Arden
Constabulary's finest!
- I just had a phone call.
- PPI? I hate those.
Mr Shiplake has had a very
distressing experience.
Now he's worried that your investigation
is going to confuse the witnesses
and mess up the trial.
That is rubbish.
Chester Patterson got him to call you
because he's scared we
might find something.
Yeah, but there's nothing to find, Frank.
You know, there was no sign that
the trap door was tampered with.
Right, look.
Hypothetically, OK, if someone
wanted to sabotage...
Oh, who? Why? When?
Look, we've done a thorough investigation
and so has the Health and Safety Executive.
Now, the only fingerprints
found on the device
were those belonging to Lawrence
Pross and a resident technician.
- Well, you must've come up with something.
- Yeah, we did.
In-house usher Iris Swifton.
She was seen having an argument with
the deceased during an interval.
- And?
- And there was a dead end!
It was just a customer complaint
that was handled badly.
And anyway, if someone wanted
to kill Mrs Shiplake, well,
she was chosen at random!
Yeah, but if Mr Pross is right,
the victim's irrelevant.
Someone wanted to ruin his career.
Yeah, and by "someone"
you mean Anton Dukes.
He was on a date the whole night.
Look, the CPS have made their decision.
The case is closed.
Well, we won't be getting in their way
if we have a look around
ourselves, will we?
Have you always wanted to be a performer?
Not really.
When I was little, I planned
on being an archaeologist.
Travel the world exploring lost temples.
It sounds silly now.
I think I just wanted to be Lara Croft.
I left school after my GCSEs,
been helping Dad ever since.
And how long has your
dad known Anton Dukes?
A few years.
Dad helped Anton out when he
first started on the circuit.
He was even going to propose
Anton for the Magic Circle
but then he found out Anton
was using some of his tricks,
passing them off as his own.
Dad reported him and Anton got blacklisted.
Do you think Dukes is
really capable of murder?
He certainly gives me the creeps.
And Dad had this book full
of his stage notes, right?
Diagrams, scripts, everything.
The Tuesday before the
accident, it went missing.
What, and you think Anton stole it?
I saw him backstage...
Maggie!
- How are tricks?
- What are you doing, Anton?
- I was... I was looking for your dad.
- He's rehearsing.
All right. Well, never mind.
I'll catch him later.
I thought you two weren't speaking.
Who told you that?
Ah, speak of the devil!
Callum!
Yes, Mr Pross?
What have I told you about
leaving the stage door unlocked?
Any vermin might crawl out of the sewer
into our crucible of magic.
Sorry, Mr Pross.
There's no need to be like that, Larry.
I thought we might start over.
Maybe I could do a guest
spot here one night.
You wouldn't have to pay.
I'd do it for the exposure.
If you wish to expose yourself,
please do it elsewhere.
Did you tell the police?
Only after the accident.
And, of course, Anton denied taking it.
I hope you don't mind me asking this but...
..does your dad normally
drink during the day?
No!
I mean...
My mum left when I was 15.
Dad took it pretty hard,
hit the bottle, but...
..he sorted himself out.
It's only since the accident...
- He's not coping.
- He's scared.
How's someone like him
going to cope in jail?
It won't come to that.
Did you get my message
about the stage notes?
Yeah, I ran it by Marlowe.
Problem is, Pross didn't
report the theft at the time.
She reckons he's making it up.
Ah, well, it is a bit convenient, isn't it?
All your notes vanishing,
just as they launch a health
and safety investigation.
- What else did she say?
- She said we were wasting our time.
Well, she's got a point, hasn't she?
I mean, how long are we planning on
just standing here doing nothing?
Look, we've got...
..46 hours and we'll be
handing out Chester's notes.
Dukes is the only person
we've got with a motive.
Right. So what are we going to find out
loitering outside his house all day?
What've I told you, eh?
Surveillance is 90% of the job.
You know we get inside people's heads,
- find out what lies beneath the surface.
- Idiot!
- I was only going to show you my rabbit!
- Really?
- Where you going?
- We haven't got time for this.
I have met men like Dukes before.
Trust me, there is nothing
going on beneath the surface.
Lu! Lu!
Lu.
Jealous? That's a laugh!
Pross is a dinosaur.
He's been doing the same
tricks since the '80s.
Why cop...?!
So, why copy them, then?
Those old illusions are
like jazz standards.
You take the classic trick
and put a new twist on it.
Anyway, I've moved on since then.
So, why were you there that night then?
Well, I like to keep an
eye on my competitors.
Even the rubbish ones.
Why would I sabotage his act
when he does such a good
job of that himself?
Well, so you could inherit his
residency at the theatre.
Yeah, well, the Terranova's
hardly worth killing for, is it?
Revenge, then.
For having you blacklisted
from the Magic Circle.
Maybe you never meant to hurt anybody.
You just wanted to embarrass Pross
and then it just all went wrong.
Obviously, badly.
Yeah, well,
I was with my date the whole time.
Yeah, we heard.
You haven't got her contact
details, have you?
Just in case she
remembered anything useful.
No, sorry, can't help you there.
Only met her the night before.
Name, maybe?
Lilly...
Milly...
No, it's gone.
Police should have her details.
And you're confident that she'll back
- your version of events, are you?
- Well, who knows?
Did my famous vanishing
act during the night,
so she might be a bit miffed.
I don't like to be there when they wake up.
Ruins the magic.
The man is a cockroach.
Yeah, but he's right, though, isn't he?
The Terranova's not worth
killing an innocent woman for.
Not even if it meant
getting revenge on Pross.
And plus, he's got an alibi.
Well, so, what are we supposed to
do, just give up? Let Chester win?
No, right, listen.
We go back to the beginning.
The victim. Maggie said she
chose the volunteer at random.
What if someone saw where she put the card
and moved it to Mrs Shiplake's seat?
Ah.
- Who?
- Marlowe mentioned an argument that night
between the victim and an on-duty usher.
Maybe we should have a word.
Iris...
- ..do you want a hand?
- I'm fine.
Iris?
- Ah, you scared the life out of me!
- Sorry. - It's OK.
I'm just a little bit jumpy since...
You know.
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure you are.
Is it all right if we just
ask a couple of questions?
So, is it true that you had an argument
with Jill Shiplake the night she died?
Ooh, sorry, I didn't mean to...
It was my fault!
I killed her!
You killed Mrs Shiplake?
She was sat behind this woman
with stupidly big hair
and she wanted to move seats
but I wouldn't let her.
Why not?
Cos I saw Maggie put
the card under her seat
and I was worried that
I'd mess up the trick!
I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
I should have just let her move!
She was already in a bad mood,
bickering with her husband...
Why were they arguing?
Well, he turned up late and then she
was asking him where he'd been.
That's all I know.
Thank you.
You've been really helpful.
You didn't see anything
else suspicious that night?
Well...
..at the interval,
we clear the auditorium and,
as I was doing my checks,
I saw Mr Shiplake coming from backstage...
Sorry, you're not allowed.
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
I was looking for the toilet.
Just got a bit lost.
Did you tell the police that?
Well, they were asking
me loads of questions
about the row with his wife and...
I guess it just slipped my mind.
But, like he said,
he was probably just lost.
Does this place have CCTV?
There's a camera at the
back by the stage door
but the police already checked
the footage from that night.
What about the Tuesday before?
I mean, Maggie assumed that
Anton stole the stage notes.
What if it was someone else?
The footage is probably still
on the hard-drive, but...
- No, I can't.
- Really?
Not even if it would
stop Pross going to jail?
My manager would freak out,
and I need this job. Sorry.
Well, listen, if you think of
anything, it would be a big help.
So, Jill Shiplake comes
from a very wealthy family.
Most of their assets are in her name.
Steffan Shiplake, however,
owns Undreamed Shores -
an independent travel agents. Made
a loss for the last two years.
So, are we talking about, like,
an episode of My Big Fat
Life Insurance Policy?
Well, the culprit's usually
someone close to the victim
and Steffan stood to gain financially.
And he asked Marlowe to warn us off.
How do we prove it?
Well, we'll ruffle his feathers a
bit, see what happens. Sebastian!
Can't a man enjoy his quinoa in peace?
Fancy going on holiday?
You've come here to ask
me if I killed my wife?!
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm just asking why you were
snooping around backstage.
I wasn't snooping anywhere!
Was it your idea to go to the magic show?
For your information, we won
those tickets in a competition
organised by the theatre for couples...
..but you don't believe me. Just ask them.
Now, I...
..would like you...
..to leave!
OK.
- Good morning.
- Isn't it?
A sports injury? I managed to
do my knee skiing last month.
Oh, no, this is a car accident years ago.
Serves me right.
Was trying to be Lewis Hamilton.
So, are we... planning a trip?
Honeymoon.
Somewhere adventurous yet luxurious,
and Olivia's adamant we only stay in
hotels with a low carbon-footprint.
Budget?
Not an issue.
Please take a seat.
Sorry. Can't shake off this
bug I picked up in Whistler.
Water?
If it's not too much trouble.
Decent of you.
Now...
..let's see what we can find.
Listen to this.
I want to see you, too.
It's not a good time.
Because I've got some private
detectives sniffing around
and it won't look good, will it?
All right, calm down!
I'll come round after work.
Five o'clock.
But we'll have to be discreet.
Looks like he's traded his
wife in for a newer model.
Hmm, he didn't exactly seem
heartbroken when I saw him.
Now, remember what I told
you about tailing people.
Slow, smooth, steady.
I thought you might try
something like this.
Just to win a silly bet.
Hey! That's wilful destruction of property.
We both know you lack reasonable grounds
to listen to my client's
private conversations.
What were you hoping to find?
- Evidence. And we did.
- Of what?
He has been conducting
an extramarital affair.
And you can prove that this relationship
started prior to Mrs Shiplake's
death, can you?
Your client was in the perfect position
to place the joker under his wife's seat.
Divorce costs a lot of money.
Now he gets the assets, the life insurance,
the compensation pay-out.
It's a strong motive, Chester.
Yeah, and we have a witness
who saw him sneaking backstage
during the interval.
Wild speculation.
If you continue bothering Mr Shiplake,
I'll have you charged with harassment.
And don't bother with another bug.
My client won't be so
careless in the future
about what he says on the phone!
- He's worried.
- Good.
We still need to get some proof, though.
So, the box office manager
says that the Shiplakes'
tickets were issued
under a complimentary code.
So, he was telling the truth.
Except no-one can remember issuing them
and they've never heard of
this couples competition.
Maybe Shiplake had an accomplice.
Who else could've processed the tickets?
Well, resident performers
are allowed comps,
so maybe Maggie or Lawrence.
Oh, and Callum told the police
that nobody went backstage
during the interval.
So, either he didn't see Shiplake...
Or Callum is lying.
Callum?
- No. He wouldn't.
- You believe he was conspiring with Anton Dukes?
No. Steffan Shiplake.
- What?
- The evidence suggests...
Oh, evidence...
..my foot!
Dukes did it.
He is an immoral, plagiarising,
ungrateful wretch!
My solicitor.
Lawrence Pross speaking.
Trust me, Callum wouldn't hurt a fly.
- Can you be sure?
- That's it!
Maggie, I'll go.
You are about to witness
a superhuman feat...
Not there! The...
How many times do I have to tell you?!
It's there.
There you are, you slug!
- Is it true?
- Is what true?
My solicitor told me you've spoken
to the Health and Safety Executive.
- Offered to be their expert witness.
- Mr Pross, shall we go outside?
How could you? Without me, you
wouldn't even have an act!
Right, Callum, can you get
him out of here, please?
So you are helping him!
It's my job, Mr Pross.
To stab me in the back?!
Admit it, Pross. You're finished.
Right.
While you're banged up, I might
even offer Maggie some work.
I'd have to give her a
test-drive first though.
- I'll kill you!
- Not the face!
No! Stop it.
Stop it. Stop!
Stop it.
Oh!
- Mr Pross!
- Why the devil did you come between us?
I was going to tell them that
it was a freak accident.
Unforeseeable.
You know, for old time's sake.
But you deserve to be banged up.
Are you all right?
You're very lucky, Mr Pross.
Am I?
Well, there's no permanent damage
- and Mr Dukes doesn't want to press charges.
- Too right.
- He's the criminal around here.
- Careful there.
I have witnesses who say you
threatened to kill him.
Oh, hello.
- Not interrupting, are we?
- No, we're done.
And so are you.
I don't want you anywhere
near Steffan Shiplake,
Anton Dukes or the Terranova Theatre...
- But I...
- ..or I will arrest you for perverting the course of justice.
Clear? Thank you.
I've messed everything up, haven't I?
- That's not true, Dad.
- Yes. It is.
Oh, look on the bright side,
if you do end up going to prison,
at least you're a trained
escapologist, aren't you?
So, what now?
I've got no idea.
Ah, you shouldn't have.
I have this effect on most women, you know.
Actually, they're for my parents.
I was just on the way to the graveyard.
The CCTV footage you wanted.
Oh, what made you change your mind?
If somebody does something wrong,
they deserve to be punished.
How long do I have to endure this?
It's like watching an am-dram
production of Waiting For Godot.
We have to watch the whole thing.
Pross said he had his
stage notes first thing,
but they were gone by the evening show.
- What was that?
- What was what?
Go back!
There!
That could be anyone.
Not just anyone. Play it again.
Look how he's walking.
We found Mr Pross' stage notes
in a bin bag round the back.
So, with the CCTV footage and
the usher's witness statement,
I'm confident that Shiplake will crack.
Oh, sorry, what was that?
"You were right, Frank."
"Sorry for ever doubting you!"
- She loves me really.
- Yeah. No, I can see that.
- Yeah. - Yeah.
- It's in her eyes.
I can't tell you how grateful I am.
That makes two of us.
As soon as my arm is better,
I'll talk to the Terranova
about having us back.
I can't wait.
You... might want to retire the
old iron maiden trick, though.
It's Marlowe.
Hello?
Well, have you charged him?
Well, that can't be right.
What's wrong?
That is him! He's lying.
How many more times?
Steffan Shiplake has an alibi
for when this was taken.
Well, then he paid
someone to cover for him.
What, the whole of the Stratford
Small Business Association?
Yeah, maybe not.
Whoever this is, it's not him.
Show me the shot of him leaving again.
- Show me again.
- Why? There's no clear shot of his face.
Just show me!
There!
- What am I looking for?
- That's Anton's poster.
The date says this was taken
the week before the accident.
Yeah, if that's true,
then there's no way that
poster would've been there.
That's...
This has been faked.
- Get out!
- We've come to apologise.
- I'm not interested.
- Mr Shiplake, honestly...
My wife's dead and you had me
dragged off to a police station!
Don't you want to find out
who's trying to frame you?
Someone went out of their way
to make us think it was you on that CCTV.
And the same person probably planted
the stage notes on your property.
We've been trying to find out
why someone would want
to see you locked up.
And?
You told our colleague
that you injured your
leg in a car accident.
That's right.
Was... anyone else injured?
- I don't see what this has got...
- Please, Mr Shiplake.
OK. Yeah. Yes.
A couple.
According to an article
that we've got, you were...
You were charged with causing
death by dangerous driving.
It was raining.
They just came out of nowhere. I...
I didn't do anything wrong.
The case was dropped.
Insufficient evidence.
This was years ago!
Why are you dragging this up now?
The thing is, we think that maybe...
Maybe your wife wasn't the
intended victim that night.
Maybe it was you.
I don't understand.
Did you two swap seats
before the second half?
Please take your seats.
The Amazing Antonio is about to commence.
Did you find anything? On the CCTV?
As a matter of fact, we did. Yeah.
Well...?
You must've watched that iron
maiden trick 100 times, eh?
Probably, yeah.
Still, you didn't want to
leave anything to chance.
Is that why you took the stage notes?
Sorry, I don't...
You sent Mr and Mrs Shiplake
tickets in the post,
telling them they'd won some competition.
And then, that night, you waited
until Maggie had hidden the joker
under the seat and you moved
it, didn't you?
And then, after Callum had
done his safety checks,
you removed the magnet
from underneath the iron maiden.
You had to find a way to put
it back without being noticed.
So, after Mrs Shiplake died,
you ran onstage and you waited
for an opportunity, didn't you?
And then you put the magnet back.
Why would I have wanted
to kill Mrs Shiplake?
I already told you,
it was just a stupid row
because she wanted to move seats!
Yes, and you couldn't allow
that, could you?
Not when you'd already hidden the
joker under Mr Shiplake's seat.
I can't see anything.
Her hair's too big.
- So?
- Can we swap seats?
Then I won't be able to see anything!
- I haven't been able to see and I can't see...
- OK. OK.
- It's our date night.
- Yeah, feels like it.
- Can we enjoy the rest of the evening now, please?
- Yes.
You blamed Steffan Shiplake for the
accident that killed your parents.
You wanted your revenge ever since.
But then your little plan went
horribly wrong, didn't it,
- when they swapped places?
- No!
And then we showed up
asking about the CCTV,
and you saw an opportunity, didn't you,
to frame him for the
murder that you committed,
putting Mr Shiplake in jail
where you felt he belonged?
It was you on the CCTV, wasn't it?
You faked it.
You lied about seeing him backstage
and you planted the notes
at the travel agency.
Come on, it was you, wasn't it?
That way!
You are about to witness
a superhuman feat...
..of endurance and escapology!
Raise the box.
Higher.
Leave me alone.
Stop!
Don't stop, you idiot!
I've got this one!
Back! It isn't what you think.
I promise.
Stay back!
- All right.
- What's going on?
- You need to calm down.
- You're ruining my act!
The police are just outside, Iris.
You might as well just give it up.
What about Steffan Shiplake?
He gets to limp away again, scot-free?
He killed my parents!
- And you killed an innocent woman.
- It was an accident. - No.
It was murder. You could've helped her,
but you watched her be led to her death.
I'm really sorry about
this, ladies and gentlemen!
Stay back!
Police! Everybody stay in your seats.
- Ow!
- Don't...
Ow! Ow!
Can someone let me down, please?
I thought I told you to
stay away from the theatre.
The thing is, I know how difficult it is
- for you to allocate appropriate resources...
- Shut up, Frank.
- Shutting up.
- Did she say anything?
Yeah. I think she'll
make a full confession.
I'll talk to the CPS in the morning.
Second time lucky, eh?
What's so urgent?
Do you want to tell him or shall I?
Erm...
How shall I put this?
Hey-hey! There we go!
Thanks.
So, what now?
Like I said,
I persuade the Terranova to take us back.
And maybe train up a new assistant.
Excuse me?
Well, I might be wrong,
but I get the impression that
Maggie's ready for a new adventure.
Is this true?
Well...
You know I've always loved
helping you with your tricks.
I remember looking after your
rabbits when I was tiny.
But...
But I...
I'd kind of like to see the
world outside of Stratford.
- I'm sorry, just...
- No! Don't be.
It's my fault. I've been too
caught up in my magic to notice.
- Thank you, both.
- Oh!
A token of my appreciation.
Is it true you bet that other detective
- that you could clear my dad's name?
- Oh, yes. - So what did you win?
