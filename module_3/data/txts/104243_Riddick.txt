I maybe just old one. </ i>
- Fury.
- I know how it is called.
Yes, definitely,
I just do not know where it is.
- I need schemes for maps.
- Impossible.
- I need a direction.
- I'm not recording, how do you think...
But you know where it is,
Commander Vaako.
Worlds are more...
Is the only existing map in my head, Riddick.
What do you want?
Crown?
Transcendence.

I've become soft. </ I>
I My instinct left me. </ I>
I probably have the worst offense committed. </ i>
I I civilized. </ i>
I somehow got it to the end. < / i>
I and I alone in this world without a name. </ i>
I need to find my

I soon realized that it was a different world out there. </ I>
I I found water, vegetation, life. </ I>
I had only one thing way. </ i>
Come on, show my teeth!
You escaped, so it?
What you got?
I thought I split it all.
Go ahead!
Stay here!
Bounty hunter.
Hold!
Stand still!
Right now!
Looks good.
's All yours.
Type "dog food".
If you're you read.
Come on, man!
Okay, get my book.
Where's Yours?
Rain. It's a good thing.
Just because you've never seen,
does not mean it's a bad thing.
It seems you have to go from here.
I Scans... </ i>
I Enabled emergency beacon at the resort P7 </ i>
I person found alive... </ i>
= = I identified as Richard B. Riddick,
escaped killer... </ i>
I has doubled the reward, if it's taught

I find nothing .
Look again Diaz.

Someone has to teach on Riddick

Get rid of the 60 kg.
- Get out! Get away from me!
- Turns up!
- Now what do you want?
- You gotta go. Okay?
- I do not want to release me.
- Not what you think.
No one will touch you.
Santana has another job now.
's Your lucky day.
Leave me the hell alone!
What planet is this?
Where are we?
Sky and water. As know.
- How could survive?
- Just go!
Until  fish change their mind.
I'm attaching it.
A So, where's my box?
My name is Santana.
I am captain of this crew.
I'm the one who knows everything.
And sees everything. And can it.
Talk about cool, huh?
Need to set a trap.
I came all this way because I have your head here.
I Have a nice day, Mr. Richard B. Riddick
</ i>
I assume will be your last moments.
If I were him,
so try not to piss.
Think about what you will be nervous you will be beheaded
!
Damn! Wine neighbors!
What a small world!
Towards  unidentified ship.
Here the Bear clan Vagos 5.
Learn that we are now on the ground.
I answered an emergency signal.
There's no danger.
I have of what to aterizaþi.
I repeat. I have why should aterizaþi
in this location now. </ I>
I did why should you aterizaþi
in this location now. </ I>
What the fuck I say?
"Leave a vessel and Get out,
or muriþi here."
It was a long way.
We must take water.
And some gravity you would make us better.
So as I said,
and I got one.
You know who that was, right?
At beacon emergency?
I be here if I did not know.
And yet the concept of "reinforcements"
do not you show interest?
My boys are neînfricaþi.
No disrespect for what's yours seem so hard
in those armor and Meche.
Damn.
I did not know the dress code.
Do not want to spoil anyone's reckoning.
If you do not mind we want to assist a while.
What if I mind?
Is a free station,
open to all mercenaries.
- By the way, my name is...
- "Too late". That's it.
"Too late".
And I feel like I-screwed,
friend.
When you do so a
Do not move a finger to help you until you
you ask me. What do you think?
I looked already is a system of caves, 5 km to the south.
Worth checking out.
More "too late"...
Need to Scotland a battery from your ship
put it next to mine, right?
How so?
Riddick reactivated as a beacon to leave the planet.
In fact, he called a cab.
- And?
- And the ship will be a good trap.
Limited space, metal walls.
A real jail cell.
's Cool, right?
It's true that half the people hanging out are below average intelligence
?
We must ensure that
crew will be ready when he comes, right?
- Come on!
- Dahl, remove the battery from the ship!
I got this.
And now you can come Riddick.
I'll say that's an exaggeration.
We atâþia guard! This is ridiculous.
Must be no more than four.
- Why jinx you? Stop talking.
- I do not care what they say.
's One guy.
- Whatever, man.
-'s Only one.
Thing would be a month this planet.
Will be a dark night.
It's an advantage for him.
Maybe we will run out first.
Will force us not to sleep.
Can not you see I'm busy?
Thinking voice.
Well, now you did it...
You can ask politely
to get out of here?
Closing the tour.
Let me know, okay?
As soon as I get my head in the box ad.
Grid 29d, Be the reception.

Now you want to know my name?
Do not know if I have your say.
Die Because that's all you know,
Santana.
'll Clean this shit!
Get your mouth shut, fucking sister!
Did it hurt?
Watch out for surprise attacks.
Maybe it's time to merge.
So I ask for help?
So I'll ask some of the equipment.
But if some of your men
have attached too much equipment
I understand.
So should be.
- I ask for the equipment?
- Kind of a thing.
Moss?
Not want, bitch.
You got the answer.
What the fuck you want?
You know what?
We combine, Santana.
But I give orders Dahl Dahl
and I'll give them orders to you.
A and the chain of command will work.
Why I do not like this plan?
I know, I know.
Because it makes me angry.
Not take orders from your bitch
that I think I may be quiet and suck!
I'm not screwing men.
There's no deserving.
Here's what will happen, Santana.
You have a subordinate role.
We'll get Riddick, I promise.
But I want him alive.
I have it one day.
When it's yours.
Give me my reward?
I pay your crew and fuel.
Rest is yours. That's the deal.
What is Riddick for you?
Not just a prisoner?
What do you want?
Why are you here?
Who are you?
My name is Johns.
Make vessels.
Take your bikes on the bridge.
'll Go with Moss and Lockspur.
I do not want  lethal. Only
electrical charge and phosphorus grenades.
Is a man who hunts at night.
We will go after him day.
Diaz Vargas,
which was dead last?
They go in that direction.
Diaz, I kind of dog here.

Dahl, the sniper rifle and cartridges

1500 m.
First hole can be found.
A stressed animal will go
known places.
In addition, detecting human pheromones.
Let them down! Down!
- It's man Santana, Falco.
- Shit, I killed a hostage.
Riddick are hunting for 10 years.
I could use a man to keep him hostage.
Falco was already dead.
It's a game sucks to lose time.
Shit!
Big trouble, right?
If Riddick is not here...
Dahl, you hear?
Anybody hear me?
Dahl, where are you?
What to do? Spying on me?
Your dreams can come true,
baby!
You have two minutes.
Then you go to do the guard.
Month!
Do not look at me, but fish guarding me!
That you're here.
Two steps forward! Two!
It could be anywhere, do not forget that.
I Damn, I hear anyone? Johns

I need to pãziþi  cupboard </ i>
I Pãziþi weapons </ i>
I like Riddick's possible to be fired us all a </ i >

I thought control cabinet.
Now get out of here!
Get out and finds the bastard!
You will not find sitting here!
You know what, honey?
I think we have something in common.
I do not fuck with my men.
Need to see something.
PARTS / fair
He wrote .
And cut all communications spaces.
Whose blood is this? There, there...
I had to beat him again.
I'm sorry.
Both amount.
Shit.
A'd say check it out.
Wait www.subtitrari.pro
- key was always sore?
- Yes.
If wrote: PARTS / FAIR
is because
opened the closet and took it.
Something we need, such as battery
,
you could change it to something
I need it.
's It?
That's not possible.
I'll try to be more explicit,
Santana.
If you managed to open the closet, to have closed again
and changed the code.
Perhaps it uses 're on the wrong,
Santana.
A and therefore...
After you...
Not know how in the last hours
I took the key from the neck
without realizing.
Would have done the right thing.
Would be put shit shit key to my neck
without realizing!
That mean?
Where did you get that idea?
From the bottom of a unicorn?
There is a reason for that is so feared!
Is a fugitive Zulu
not a wizard.
If you're convinced...
Ridiculous!
This is ridiculous!
First three idle!
- I blew it.
- It happens and Russian roulette.
But not sure that will go blank and the fourth move.
For the first time I agree with you.
We have nothing to fear.
Diaz, say they are in danger?
- No, no danger.
- Come content!
Show what you got!
A I'd say that's your specialty,
lesbiano!
- I do not open that thing.
- I've been doing!
Absolutely not!
Ready!
Shreds use your brain!
We're not here to work for Riddick.
Allow guns and forget about what you write.
He was here!
Was in!
Santana, put down that sword.
- Do what you want, but open it!
- You know what's the problem?
If you do not open this closet,
we can go.
O God, and plead my life...
- Four!
- Continues!
Five!
Why not I thought?
Six!
Six!
Six.
Are you hell, Santana,
must admit.
- How much I owe you this time?
- I think it will succeed i
This is a sign.
Great.
I think it's a sign.
May God tells us we take
battery and quick to leave the planet.
's My lucky charm.
Did you have the wrong career, guys.
Could to explode the bomb.
I sealed cave of phosphorus grenades.
So will not go.
It's like an animal that will go
to places unknown.
But I have already tried 3-4
plans to save us.
Go like rays from this point.
Radio is fundamental.
The three transmitters inventory.
Find the them.
Replace them at regular intervals.
I do not want interrupted communications. </ I>
I have to be in constant contact. </ I>
I Whatever happens, we must
inform each other. </ i>
you afraid of me?
Yes, yes.
Afraid of me?
Yes, they're afraid of you.
Afraid of what you do not.
Lockspur, all motorcycles must block
, understand?
Do not want to move more than it does.
Dahl
I saw a den where you can hide yourself.
Between these hills .
Moss.
- I've seen.
- What?
I just saw.
Dahl, keep the ship!
Diaz, control it and on to you!
The others will oversee the entire area!
Be vigilant!
Santana,
Riddick took the battery!
Coming!
Put ​​batteries together.
Get it from a ship and put them in another.
Amps are amps.
Amps are not the problem,
but incurs as a ship.
If im wrong with a few milli joules,
finish up circuits.
Then calculated and do it!
Did I could keep an intensive thermodynamic equilibrium
exchange and energy right here,
or you could give me little confidence...
Well, obviously! Ships are incompatible
,
but not flying without those batteries.
- I think we stole the beanie alone.
- That I and I.
And if you take a motorcycle two days food
and I'm looking for that bastard?
- Bad idea. N Face-to face with Riddick?
- So try to restore emergency beacon.
Like I would call an ambulance
another?
Reinforcements to strengthen?
Does not make sense!
- I think he's the one stuck here.
- Bad credit.
I you expected while strengthening. </ I>
I
If you want to repair the lighthouse and to ask for help... </ i>
- It's radio Falco.
- Riddick, I need help.
I have everything I need to have your
ruin your day.
Finds the cave you want,
escape, hide...
I do not care...
Because all you'll get!
Look at South.
I can not believe!
Can not say that it has courage,
dammit!
Dahl, stay here to watch.
- What do I do?
- Hide!
Go! Www.cautsex.com
On my signal.
- To get as reward?
- I know, I'm not here for that.
- I bet that the animal knows.
- Yes, you won the bet.
I know just to get you dead if
doubled.
What's New! Www.subtitrari.pro
You get to pay funeral?
I care...
Only a small planet, isolated,
in with an M-344G system.
I want to know what happened there 10 years ago.
You're dad!
- Johns young father.
- Yes, exactly.
You all this way just to meet you and to me?
I am very honored.
's Funny you do not know the date of death of their own son.
It strange that three people died
just like you...
No, no!
Do not try to figure comes off!
- Look at those dead.
- I think there's something I'm concerned there.
Designed with barium
stun or explosive tip?
Tell me that you want.
Sedative for dogs.
OK!
I'm sorry to interrupt
conversation about ancient history
but if I could intervene
and introduce myself...
- My name is...
- Man box.
What?
You said that you've put your head in a box.
- True.
- Well, I was...
I said something stupid!
- But you box.
- I have a box?
So I've found.
Sure I have a box.
They all have one.
- Diaz has a huge box.
- Okay.
Then they use it.
Three have died.
There are eight.
I usually finish the job.
Sometimes killing six,
kill nine times.
Depends on the situation.
But things will change here.
None will want to be on this planet in 24 hours.
- So I suggest you find a solution.
- What? An agreement?
I leave a battery.
You have a grab.
Other battery and other ship
I remain me.
Wait, wait! What game is this?
Bingo for retarded?
- From the beginning they set...
- Just drop early.
End should you do now.
You see that?
You have time until it started raining.
A So, put your agreement.
Man box!
Shoot now!
Again!
Nothing! Do not fall!
Again !
Come fall once!
I'll take care, Dahl.
Riddick! Riddick!
Johns!
You got to beat the handcuffed men off!
Okay, here we go again.
For historical archives.
Hunter Gratzner,
merchantman that my son used it
take you to the gallery, sent a signal near the M-344G
.
A
isolated system with two suns and a habitable planet.
Do you know if he survived the collapse?
In a few hours will be a hell here,
but whatever happens...
Any How would you say
careful not to touch my handcuffs.
They? They?
You know who you talking about?
Look at me?
If I remove handcuffs,
man-box, you will be dead in five seconds.
Is that so?
And what do you want to kill me?
The mouth?
- With that shiny blade.
- I'd like to try.
However, to historical archives,
was saved.
Just the two?
There were about how many are here.
- Have managed to escape all know?
- Three.
- I do not and he.
- No.
A So, between
impact and when you leave the planet,
My son died.
I bet you killed him.
Me in and he?
I wasting my time!
You meet one last desire?
- Holler Dahl.
- I do not deny that there are exciting handcuffs.
But, I feel like you
horseback in front of Astoria.
And if so kill them all before?
Take it easy.
Left a sedative.
Tell me what you see out the window.
Unit  Cyclope, two ships and two bodies
INFA and out in plastic.
- You certainly do not see and something else?
- There's nothing.
Tell me when you see something.
's Nice your nail.
Yeah?
Roz-aggressive.
Fits with nipples.
Why stay here to listen to crap?
It over with!
I'll tell you what will happen.
In 60 seconds, I'll head
enters into that box.
Nothing will save you hell.
But maybe-n
last minute you can be something better than a bastard!
And give me the damn answer!
Please!
Do you have anything to add to what I said.
Time out.
Timeout.
Is yours.
Hold it well.
Final match, mate.
Probably those dingo shit.
Damn!
Did you called.
They came to kill us.
Reflectors!
I just said.
Not have to worry about me.
- What is happening? What's out?
- I do not know. Must be something monstrous.
I do not like at all.
Heading toward us.
Whatever it is,
is not easy to kill.
What the hell is it?
Shit .
Do not make any other holes in the roof.
Tell you what's going to happen.
In 60 seconds I'll remove the handcuffs, we're going to recover batteries
and we leave these rocks.
At some point it will be very ugly.
Johns will cancel,
So how did the young Johns.
And when this is over
and you'll not only be you some corpses
I will riding Dahl,
just because I will ask her...
Fondly and nationality.
What does that would be bad?
That's not bad for you?
I know what you're thinking?
What's going on?
Who knows how long it rains!
Or who knows how many of those things are buried
out!
He saw everything with those eyes
and not say anything!
A ship for you, one for me.
Need to know if those batteries can recover.
And I want to know if there is any agreement
.
Yes, there are.
Not Scotland handcuffs!
Let them settle accounts between them.
Okay, all right.
Standing.
Bravo chicken lightly!
Damned!
Exactly.
A'd say get them out handcuffs.
I took five seconds.
I like to pertain to the word.
You too, Johns?
And God will give His angels
power over me...
- Shut the Moon!
- I think angels are here.
Protect me. And if you are here
to watch me,
maybe I will save...
Crap scares us all!
Shut up Month!
You shut up, Vargas!
Leave him alone boy!
What the hell!
No, no, no, no!
You crazy, stupid?
I could kill!
I killed him, right?
Vargas up!
Come Vargas up!
- It's okay, come on! He was small.
- Children are the most dangerous and i
Have more venom than all.
Boy...
Not confuses him and God in it.
Not in the mood to get into this.
I forgot to tell you that we do not have guns
for you.
Are you sure you can go with it?
I will drive as if I were stolen.
Watching him sideways.
If Riddick returns without us,
I want to kill him. Do you understand?
When? Before or after?
- You're a jerk! I looked and i ..
- I'd be guarded, if we had weapons.
Do you wants your batteries than this,
is not so, Johns?
I imagine you did not waste time
to bury him, is not it?
Probably be a shock to you, Johns,
but I did I killed my son.
A do it yourself.
- What? What does that mean?
- Morphine!
Your son was using morphine.
Twice a day.
Not knew he was using?
Was like most mercenaries .
Par responsible, brave I. ..
Until you looking better and see that something's wrong.
- Lacked his strength.
- I do not want to hear that shit!
- It's not the man I knew.
- Then you have your son knows teai.
Wanted to kill a boys-and
as to save his skin.
I did not like it.
I do not think my son could have killed a child
and to save lives.
I get brain and prostate Morphine </ i>
I Only fools </ i>
I do not think my son was evil
in this story you invented it!
I do not tell stories.
I reason.
None of us has reason.
Thanks  you started, but now I continue
!
Animal stupid!
A So, you sword was buried
for me?
For anyone deserves.
We have a problem, Riddick.
I have two batteries here and just a motorcycle.
And I have no intention to horseback
're with me.
Just a bike?
Are you sure, Johns?
A bearing out, damn!
Did you realize that Diaz batteries and just wanted to kill me.
Loaded!
Watch your head.
Come on!
Someone's coming.
- Get the battery!
- Just you?
See if it works well!
- Chief!
- See if it works!
You get out of here!
Courage, Dahl, you only have 30 seconds!
Hurry up!
I wanna ask something,
fondly and nationality.
Too many people have died.
I do not know if you manage to ignore it next time.
Would not have been so if he had not tried
to stick my head in a box.
Where will you go?
In fact, let it go,
do not tell me I do not want to know.
I Instead I'll tell you all something. </ I>
I Sooner or later, we all go home
. </ I>
Tell Dahl
to keep my place in her heart.
And you, Johns,
do not ever lose your courage.
