<i>Whose idea was this?</i>
<i>What idea?
Meeting here.</i>
Theirs.
<i>Why?
It looks like we're dealing dope.</i>
<i>You like listening to static?
It's tough getting FM, okay?</i>
<i>Sure, under a fucking freeway
and high tension wires.</i>
<i>These guys are late.</i>
<i>What time did they say
they were gonna meet you?</i>
<i>Seven.
Yeah, they're real late.</i>
<i>Okay, what do I do about it now?</i>
<i>Why don't you just back up
and see if you can get K-EARTH?</i>
<i>Boy, this is not too cool. He ought
to lower his brights, at least.</i>
<i>Lights, goddamn it!</i>
<i>Jesus Christ! We're
just meeting here...</i>
<i>...to make sure we
weren't followed.</i>
<i>Christ, how did I get here?</i>
<i>He's got the cash.
Now we got to go weigh it and test it.</i>
<i>Why not just do it
on the hood of the car?</i>
Stop here.
What are you looking at?
Peanut shells.
Right! Jesus!
Go in the room and leave the door
unlocked. I'll be there in a minute.
What were you doing in there?
Who is it?
Answer it.
It's Leland, man.
Andy, how you doing, baby?
Great.
Say hello to Nick.
Nick's my partner.
Hold it.
Who the fuck is that?
It's a friend.
He's not my friend.
And I got all the friends I need.
He's my ride.
He drove me, that's all.
Let him wait in the car.
I don't like meeting strangers.
Look, he's just a friend of mine.
Hey, that's cool.
Just let me take a quick leak
and I'll be out of here.
Deal's still good.
How do you want
to weigh it and test it?
We'll work it out, Andy.
It's none of my business...
...but I don't think you should be looking
for any new faces in your life, either.
Fine with me. I'll wait outside.
Hey.
Pfft. I thought you retired.
I am retired.
Then what are you doing here?
A favor.
Oh, you mean a felony favor.
A client paid him
with a pound of coke.
He wanted me to hold his hand
while he sells it.
Man, that is one flimsy fucking excuse.
Oh, yeah?
He also tells me his customer asks more
questions about me than the dope.
My phones have
funny little noises on them.
You're setting me up, Nick.
Not tonight, pal.
I got here by accident.
Ha! Talk about a
flimsy fucking excuse!
Later.
This is going down right now.
And do yourself a favor.
Don't go back to the car.
Don't you go back to the room.
There's no evidence.
I'm sorry. I couldn't afford to have
him busted, as dumb as he is.
He's my lawyer.
Who authorized this shit?
You did, lieutenant.
Look, Nick,
that's what we were told, okay?
What a waste of time.
<i>Units 3,
4 and 5, return to parking lot.</i>
<i>Units 6 and 7...</i>
<i>...check all of the exits and the
stairwell. Look at those vents...</i>
Got a runner
going across the freeway!
Fucking A!
Forty-five minutes.
It's the only fucking phone
I've ever met that don't...
Get in there!
<i>Vallenari's. Good evening.</i>
Hi, this is Dale McKussic.
<i>Yeah, Mr. McKussic, I'm sorry.
It's a little noisy at the moment.</i>
<i>Aren't we seeing you this evening?</i>
I don't think
I'm gonna make my reservation.
I'm gonna be a little late.
<i>How late will you be?
Uh...</i>
I don't know.
How late is the kitchen open?
Tell me something, Hal.
When you asked for my help, you didn't
know who you were asking me to bust?
I knew who it was.
Why didn't you bust him?
Well, you know that too.
He's a friend of mine.
The first thing I heard
when I came to L.A...
...Nick wouldn't work South Bay because
he didn't wanna bust McKussic.
Tonight you proved that point.
You not only let him walk...
...you kicked him out and gave
him a personal escort. Why?
Because you're predictable, Hal.
You're very predictable.
Mac saw you coming a mile away.
How did you know he wasn't holding?
Was Andy Leonard?
You busted him.
Okay. No coke. No sale.
No conspiracy to sell.
All you've got is a
lightweight conversation...
...with a chickenshit
Century City lawyer.
And a probable lawsuit
for entrapment.
Mac's lawyers would make
mincemeat of you.
I let him walk to save you
from a bad bust.
Hal.
I did you a favor.
<i>How are you?</i>
<i>Fine, thank you.</i>
What is it?
It's McKussic.
You're kidding.
He's in and out of this
place all the time.
Andy Leonard's the lawyer
for this restaurant.
McKussic and the Vallenaris
talk drugs and money?
They're real careful what they say.
Let me hear.
I told you, Nick, they're real careful.
I'm sure you're right. Could I hear?
Yeah, sure!
<i>In that case,
why don't I give you a taste...</i>
<i>...of something different tonight?</i>
<i>How about...</i>
<i>...rigatoni?</i>
<i>Rigatoni?
Rigatoni quattro formaggi.</i>
<i>A creamy blend of
four Italian cheeses.</i>
<i>Fontina, taleggio,
gorgonzola, and parmigiano.</i>
<i>Sounds good.</i>
Sounds good to me too.
Look, before we spend another
five grand to hear Mac's dinner...
...take my guys off the clock
and let me ask him.
Unless you guarantee the Federal
government's picking up the tab tonight.
Thanks.
What's good here?
Everything.
Why, are you hungry?
I missed dinner.
Oh.
What are you having?
A little pasta.
Something like
rigatoni quattro formaggi?
Good guess.
Dinner's over, Bart.
Pay the tab at the bar.
You just had the head of Narcotics arguing
with the DEA about what you're doing here.
Why?
What do you mean?
You're a drug-dealer and
don't pay taxes.
I'm not active these days.
But you're a legend around here, man.
Not only that, you're white.
When they print your picture in the
paper, they'll be able to see it.
So, what do you figure, Nick?
I made lieutenant.
It'll be announced next week.
I'm the head of Narcotics
for L.A. County.
Gee, uh, congratulations.
That's all you got to say?
What about your law degree?
I thought you were trying to get--
Stop worrying about my career. The
government swears you're doing business.
I'm not, here or anywhere.
And you couldn't catch me if I was.
Try the sand dabs.
Try the sand dabs.
Okay.
Here, look. Watch!
That's terrific.
You know, I just...
...think something's going on.
I don't stop being a detective
because there's no crime.
What do you think's going on?
Something you don't want me to know.
How are we treating you
this evening, Mr. McKussic?
Uh, fine, thank you.
Can I offer you anything more?
More?
There are two fish you haven't
tried. They're excellent.
Sure.
What are they?
I thought I'd surprise you.
Uh, this is my friend,
Nick Frescia.
A pleasure, Jo Ann Vallenari.
Can I bring you a plate?
Thanks,
I've got to be going.
Try us another night.
What I tried tonight was terrific.
I'm pleased to hear it.
She's attractive.
Huh? Oh, yeah.
So, how about it?
How about what?
Whatever you're doing...
...do it somewhere else.
Don't make me look bad.
There is one last thing.
There's no new business.
It's, uh, an accounting problem.
Accounting?
The Colombians.
Always some discrepancy
about money.
Sure. They don't
know how to count.
I got your word, Mac?
Yeah.
One more thing.
Jesus.
How about another bite of that
fucking fish, man? It's great.
I give him two drinks.
That's two too many.
If my brother sees Nino like this--
What's he gonna do, fire him?
No, he's not going to
fire the chef, Arturo.
But one bartender less
is not the end of the world.
I don't want him driving that car.
He can have mine.
Your Cadillac?
You want to kill him?
I'll drive. I could dance.
No, no.
Yes.
No, you're going home.
Why?
<i>Happy birthday.</i>
<i>How did you know it was my birthday?</i>
<i>Oh, uh, Arturo told me.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
Well?
Well, uh...
In the course of last night...
...something came up
which persuaded me...
...that Mac dining in that restaurant
is a non-drug related activity.
Yeah.
Your friend's not gonna get away
with what he's gotten away with...
...for 15 years and just retire.
What do you suggest?
I suggest you make sure
we have a case.
After all, what are friends for?
<i>We haven't seen you in a while.</i>
<i>I've been a little busy lately.
And I took a break, you know?</i>
<i>Did you go away
for Thanksgiving?</i>
<i>Yeah, I went up to
Aspen and put the skids on.</i>
<i>Put skids on?</i>
<i>Yeah, I went skiing-</i>
<i>Are you good?
No.</i>
<i>Well, passing.</i>
<i>I'm not an expert.
Are you?</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>You should
go sometime. It's fun.</i>
<i>Maybe I will.</i>
Goddamn it, that the fuck
is the matter with you?
I don't need you
flying in from Washington...
...taking over my office,
telling me to manufacture evidence.
This is my backyard, Hal! I don't grow
weeds in my backyard so I can pull them.
Mac.
Mac.
I swear to God I wasn't trying to use you.
I was just trying to pay some bills.
Well now you got another one to pay.
Man, if I don't come through,
these guys'll kill me.
Ha, no, they won't kill you. They'll
probably just break your legs.
Here comes the
money junkie.
I've been calling and calling.
And I just broke a fucking nail!
I sent your
lawyer the check, Shaleen.
Tomorrow's the first.
You might as well write another one.
Shaleen, uh...
I'm at a critical point in
this business that requires cash.
So do I. Sorry, I'm not starving
so you can tell your little boy...
...you're a rubber hose salesman
instead of a drug dealer.
Cody gets old enough to ask
what his father does for a living...
...he suddenly develops a conscience.
Greg, I'll deal
with that other stuff later.
Leave my kid out of this.
Our kid.
Anyway, I need another 10,000.
The Mercedes burned up.
The SLC?
It's under warranty.
Take it back, make them fix it.
You know those assholes. They claim I
didn't have any oil in the engine.
I made an improper suggestion.
I overreacted. It was uncalled for.
No, no.
No. It was my fault.
Well...
Okay.
Ha-ha-ha.
Look, I wanna lay my cards on the table.
Whatever questions you have
about our operation...
...go ahead, ask me. Shoot.
Okay. Who's your snitch?
I can't tell you that.
Ahem. We got to start
somewhere, Hal.
How about, uh, July 17, 1963?
"Frescia and McKussic
were arrested...
...for curfew violation
on Hermosa Beach."
Seven years later you
were with Mac...
...when he was arrested for drugs
on Rosarito Beach.
No, he was on the beach.
I was in the water. Otherwise I'd
have been smoking a joint with him.
Ended up in the same Mexican jail
for 2 years. What can I say?
Hal, you have really
done your homework.
Nick, this is not about
you being a cop.
I know you're one
of the best.
You're close to Mac.
Mac is close to Carlos.
And he is coming to town.
Who says?
He's getting ready to move
1200 kilos of coke...
...personally.
That's the word.
For $1100 a week a local snitch is liable
to tell you anything you want to hear.
I'm also hearing it
from the Federal Mexican Police...
...and believe me,
I'm not paying them.
Like you say,
this is your back yard.
Has Carlos ever made a move in it
without Mac's help?
No. If Carlos is back in town,
Mac's back in business.
So, what do you want from me?
Use your relationship with Mac...
...to get to Carlos.
How?
Any way you can.
If Mac is clean,
it's gonna do him a lot of damage.
Say he is working with Carlos
and we bust him.
I will personally
guarantee that Mac...
...does not have to stand trial
in federal court.
You're liable to save him
15 years of his life.
I've cleared out of
your office, Nick.
It's me, Mac.
<i>Hey, my buddy.</i>
No, you called me, buddy.
Hey, not now, man.
They're watching me everywhere 1 go.
Chrissake.
I'm telling you, man,
there's renewed interest in me here.
My cousin used my name
as a guarantee of delivery.
It's not my cousin
I'm not worried about. It's you.
Don't come here now.
Not now.
Your chef's visa has expired.
He does have a work permit.
My brother's hired a lawyer
working through Immigration...
...to get Nino his green card.
You mean Andy Leonard?
Yes.
Have you ever seen Andy Leonard
in your restaurant...
...with a Mr. Dale McKussic?
Yes, they're both
very good customers.
What's that?
What's what?
A "good customer."
Someone who is on time.
And doesn't make personal requests
or demands for unusual dishes.
In other words, you're telling us...
...you've never had to satisfy any
personal requests from Mr. McKussic.
No, Mr. Maguire,
he usually orders off the menu.
Who are you and what's this about?
Agent Maguire.
Federal Drug Enforcement.
Has Andy Leonard been arrested
on some sort of drug charge?
We arrested him.
What makes you think
my restaurant's involved?
For one thing,
Leonard's in there all the time.
So is the District Attorney.
Does that mean he's selling drugs?
Mr. Leonard doesn't have dinner
with the DA He has it with McKussic.
Mr. McKussic
is selling drugs in my restaurant?
Maybe.
Well, all I do is see him eat.
Miss Vallenari, we know
how important your chef is to you.
We have our problems.
We certainly...
...don't have to help
Immigration with theirs.
In other words,
if I'll spy on my customers...
...you'll make sure my chef
isn't deported for drunk driving?
I didn't say that, Miss Vallenari.
Don't bother to explain.
At 8:00, I'll be seating my lawyer
and his ex-partner, a federal judge.
I'm sure they'll understand what
you meant and explain it to me.
Okay, Hal.
Hello, I'm Lieutenant Frescia
from the Sheriff's Department.
We've met,
with Mr. McKussic.
Absolutely.
And when you sue him...
...I don't want to be anywhere
in sight. Get me out of here.
Doesn't matter.
We'll have Arturo come--
Take care of it.
Everything okay?
It's nothing. Somebody
dropped last night's evidence...
...including Nina's urine specimen.
What's that mean?
It means we'll have to drop the case.
No court?
No court.
No court!
Hey. Hey! Take it easy, for chrissake!
I work here.
What's on your mind?
The way I met you with Mr. McKussic.
You seemed like friends.
Yeah. Well...
I'm sorry.
It's really none of my business.
You've been terrific.
Oh, don't worry about it. Just...
...buy me dinner one of these days.
Any goddamn day you want, Nick.
Heh. Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.
We got the word your friend
McKussic has got a deal cooking.
Yeah?
We're gonna nail him.
If anybody can do it, Hal, you can.
Why'd you let her chef go?
She's tough, isn't she?
Ha, ha.
She beat the shit out of you, Hal.
The hell she did.
Ha, ha. The hell she didn't.
Ask anybody.
Frescia,
what you got going on here?
Shit.
Mac! Hi.
Where've you been?
I've been looking for you.
In Chula Vista,
trying to sell farm equipment.
So, what are the
Sin Sisters doing here?
They're just
cranking on the coke.
Mac, I'm kidding. I'm just kidding.
They're just leaving.
What can I do for you?
I'll do anything.
Name it.
You can start by cleaning off that table
there, and get some new paddles and balls.
Suddenly up for some Ping-pong?
And I want you to drop something off
at Vallenari's for me.
Who for?
Jo Ann Vallenari.
Aren't you going there tonight?
I want to clean up first.
Besides, it'll give her a chance
to look that over before we talk.
And Greg, could you give it a rest?
Whatever, man. I hear you.
What is it?
The cop. He's waiting for you.
How nice.
It's not nice, he's a cop who
thinks he did you a favor.
And cops are the worst barflies.
It's not worth it,
I'm telling you.
You just don't like
his looks, Arturo.
It's quite an experience
watching you work.
Oh?
Like you're in a play,
everything's on cue.
You are kind of letter-perfect.
Ha, ha. Thank you.
Tell me, do you ever flub your lines?
Ha.
Is that a polite way of suggesting
I lack spontaneity?
Have you seen Mac?
M r. McKussic.
Oh.
He's going to ask you
to cater a party.
That is our business.
We think it involves his business.
What are you suggesting? That I refuse
because it's a party for drug dealers?
No. It's just that it's for this one
particular guy, he's particularly unpleasant.
You mean violent?
No, I doubt that.
Unless he doesn't like your lasagne.
I'm sure Mr. McKussic's friend
will be very well-behaved.
Why would you call him a friend?
Just a figure of speech.
Who else would you give a party for?
A business associate.
As it happens,
Carlos and Mac are friends.
And you and Mac are friends.
That's right.
Sounds like a pretty friendly
situation all around.
Oh, no, not exactly.
Nobody knows Carlos.
Nobody even knows what Carlos
looks like but Mac.
And you want to know
what Carlos looks like...
...and you're asking me to spy
so you can find out?
Absolutely not!
<i>Look, let's not discuss my business
or his business or your business, okay?</i>
But that leaves us
nothing to talk about.
Let's eat.
Good evening.
<i>She's having dinner with him.</i>
She can't be.
The chef is with them right now
checking out their Caesar salads.
What do you want me to do
with the envelope?
You want me to drop it off anyway?
Yeah, I'm beat.
I'll never make it in there.
Um, thanks.
You meet at Orville and Wilbur's
maybe once every Christmas, right?
He throws his Chevrolet keys
on the bar.
You throw your Porsche keys
on the bar.
You pick up your drink,
you got a gold Rolex on your wrist.
He's wearing a Timex.
Even if he wasn't a cop,
he'd have to hate your guts.
<i>Deputies
seized over 700 kilos of cocaine...</i>
<i>...with an estimated street value
of $27 million.</i>
Street value, $27 million.
On what street is that?
You show me how to get there
just once.
Man, aren't you listening to me?
Nick Frescia came in to that restaurant
looking for a way to bust your buns.
Well he's gonna have to drag me
out of bed to do it. I'm...
...under the weather. Heavily.
Hey, Mac.
Yeah?
What I'm telling you
is for your own good, man.
That swordfish was great.
Mm. Excellent piece.
And the Cristal.
You know it.
We serve it at the
Lomita station.
What do cops drink?
Ah, hell, depends. I recommend
my men stay away from vodka.
And stick to Scotch and bourbon.
Why?
So the brass will know
they're drunk, not stupid.
You have an answer for everything.
So do you.
Every question Maguire asked, you answered
like you were reading off a menu.
Your keys, Jovana.
Thank you, Arturo.
And yours.
Want me to lock up?
No, I'll lock up. Make sure
the kitchen is closed.
Good night, Arturo.
You were saying.
You're still suspicious
of me and Mr. McKussic.
Yeah.
You actually think...
...we're in business together.
No.
Oh.
I--I don't date the customers,
Nick.
Especially when they drive
$50,000 cars and always pay in cash.
Then you'd heard about Mac.
Sooner or later, you hear everything
in a restaurant.
And he's never asked you out?
No.
You're still suspicious.
If I was, what difference would it make?
You'd talk me out of it.
That's not it.
No?
No, you're just suspicious of any
woman who hasn't slept with you.
Jo Ann...
Heh.
...that is a wildly off-the-wall
assumption on your part.
What is it, Nick? You need
some Chap Stick or lip gloss?
Your lips keep getting stuck on your
teeth, or is that your idea of a smile?
That's my idea of a smile.
Oh, man, you are.
You're tough.
You're a bad boy, Nick.
You're a very bad boy.
What's this mean?
Redondo Union High.
You smoked in high school?
Oh, yeah. We were a bunch
of rowdies, Jo Ann.
How about an espresso?
What?
I've got to lock up
and I'll never do it like this.
Oh, no!
Jo Ann, what are you doing?
I--
I want this under there.
Here, let me--
No, no, you'll get dirty.
Don't be silly.
Ugh. That skylight's indented
for some reason, so rain...
...fills it up into a puddle
until it becomes a pond, and then...
And then what?
And then you're all wet.
I'm sorry. Oh, Nick, I'm sorry.
I really should have just left it.
<i>I don't know what it is...</i>
<i>...about going to high school
with someone...</i>
<i>...that makes you feel you're
automatically friends for life.</i>
<i>Who says?</i>
<i>Who says friendship lasts forever?</i>
<i>We'd all like it to, maybe...</i>
<i>...but maybe it just wears out
like everything else.</i>
<i>Like tires.</i>
<i>There's just so much
mileage in them...</i>
<i>...and then you're riding around
on nothing but air.</i>
Okay, keep your shirt on.
Any word on, uh, where
McKussic's giving the party?
How would I know? I'm waiting to hear
it from your snitch, whoever that is.
I don't know, I keep coming back to this.
What do you think?
Frescia. Hi.
Uh, excuse me, Hal.
This is a personal call.
How about a movie?
<i>I can't tonight. We're booked solid.</i>
This afternoon.
<i>Don't you ever work?</i>
Yeah, I'm working now.
Don't say that or I'll believe you.
I always believe the worst.
I'm gonna die if I don't see you.
Well, we can't have that. Um...
Check out the competition with me
this week...
...and we can both keep working.
Where's Jo Ann?
She's taking a few days off.
Mr. McKussic?
Your table is ready.
I'll have the drink sent over.
Thank you.
Where the fuck have you been?
Working my ass off, Hal.
Mac's party is a week from tomorrow
at his house...
...at 1:00 in the
afternoon for 56 guests.
You like cappuccino?
<i>We got two, uh, coming out.</i>
<i>Down front, two males.</i>
I got them.
<i>She won't talk
as long as the checks keep coming.</i>
Surprise!
What would you like?
What's with the hotdog?
Doesn't anybody like hotdogs anymore?
That's a good one.
And I place mystery dust over it,
and it becomes an egg.
You know how I do it?
Ha, ha.
What's so funny?
That dogcatcher.
He's not catching the dog.
Yeah, that's right.
Wrong size handcuffs.
I'm leaving right now.
Bye.
Uh, thank you. Nice food.
Thank you. Nice party.
You're a real magician.
I was surprised.
Well, it was a surprise party.
Ha, ha.
Did it surprise your boy?
Oh, yes.
Not as much as it surprised
the 25 cops on the beach...
...but it did, yeah.
You're gonna tell me
that's a surprise?
No.
Mr. Frescia said there was a possibility
the police would be watching you.
Did he say why?
Yes.
Do you want me to be specific?
I'd appreciate that.
He said you were
a serious drug dealer.
And that you promised to quit, but
that you lied and are still doing it.
He called me a drug
dealer and a liar?
What a bummer.
I guess I can't blame you.
Blame me for what?
Telling Nick about the party.
Thanks again.
I didn't tell Nick about the party.
He told me.
What was I supposed to do?
I didn't know it was
for your child's birthday.
You didn't order the cake from us.
I didn't even know you had a child.
I thought it was for someone
called "Carlos."
Just pretend like
none of this ever happened.
Yeah, thanks.
We got the harbor patrol involved?
They do surveillance in the marina.
There's boats in the marina.
You see, this is a house.
A house is not gonna float away.
It's not gonna fucking move!
Frescia.
Yeah, put him through.
Hey! How you doing?
In my office. How about you?
In my office.
I was wondering, Nick,
if we could get together somewhere.
Well, yes, any particular time?
Well how about right now?
Yeah. Sure, why not?
When you say the man
is giving a party in a week.
Hang on.
And Carlos is coming to town in a week--
Who's your snitch, Hal?
Huh? He hasn't gotten
a goddamn thing right.
You look for Mac in L.A.,
he's in San Francisco.
You go for Carlos,
you get Mac's kid.
Sin Sisters?
Listen, I'm not authorizing
any more county funds--
Hey. Shit.
Unless you get someone
who can actually identify Carlos.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I don't know any-- Is he right there?
Just about.
Everything all right?
How come you tried to get me
kicked out of my favorite restaurant?
You told Jo Ann about
me, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
You got a reason?
I didn't want her getting
into something that might hurt her.
Is that why you
told her about Carlos?
So that she could identify him?
Is that your way of making sure
that she doesn't get hurt?
Okay, I fucked up.
Look, Mac...
...I've been seeing a lot of Jo Ann and
obviously it affected my judgment here.
Nick...
...if you want to go after Carlos,
go after him.
Just don't use me to do it, okay?
I don't get it, Mac.
I mean, what?
Guy saves your life
in a Mexican prison...
...so you owe him for the
next 20 years, is that it?
Huh?
None of my business.
Exactly.
Oh, by the way, you, uh, told Jo
Ann about the party, didn't you?
No, Mac.
You got it backwards.
She told me.
Oh, well, then I guess
she got it backwards, huh?
Well, that's understandable.
You confronting her like that,
she probably got flustered.
After all...
...she's not used to
that sort of thing.
She's a very traditional girl.
By the way, wish Cody
a happy birthday for me, will you?
Sure.
Jovana!
Could you hold a moment?
Yes?
What do you want me to do
with Mr. McCussky's tip?
McKussic. What you normally do, divide it
among everyone who worked the party.
It was a pretty good tip.
What are you talking about?
Well, his bill is $2500..
Yes.
...and his tip is $2500.
There's $5000 in there?
Must have
been a pretty good party.
Arturo, give me that envelope.
If you're looking for Mac,
he's down at the competition.
Thanks.
Cody!
Get...
...away from the pier!
Holy smoke, it's you!
Yes, it is.
Look, Mr. McKussic, I don't want
your money. I don't want any of it.
Uh, how come?
What did you think you were paying for?
What? I don't get it,
if it's not enough...
No, it's not enough.
Did you think you could buy me?
Buy you what?
There's $5000 in there!
Lower your voice, okay?
I don't want anybody to think there's
something going down. $5000?
That's right.
I must have grabbed the hundreds.
Uh, you owe me.
What? This was a mistake?
Wrong envelope.
Um, Shaleen must have the fifties.
She'll be pissed. Uh--
What did you think
I was trying to buy for $5000?
Hey, man, you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. He's hurt.
Could you get everybody out of here?
I'll get the gate.
What do you see?
What do you see?
A Kleenex.
Blow your nose on that!
Still hurt?
I feel like shit.
Mom's gonna blame this on you.
Cody, uh, watch your language.
How about if I send over
some angel hair pasta?
Would you like that?
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Be well, Cody.
I don't know what I'd have done
if you hadn't come along.
Greg had my car.
God, I'm sorry about that,
I don't usually do things like that.
How can somebody make you sign forms
when your kid's neck--?
Why don't you sit down?
I'll just have some Herradura.
Your boy lives with you?
That depends.
On what?
Money and his mama's mood.
Don't you think you've
had enough of that?
You want to hear Cody if he wakes up
and needs something, don't you?
You're not gonna answer me, are you?
I don't think you want me to.
Yes, I do.
Okey-dokey. Uh...
I'll answer any question you
care to ask. How about that?
Okay.
Bet I know the first one.
Oh, what's that?
How can you feel about your boy
the way you do and sell drugs?
Cocaine. It is cocaine, isn't it?
Well, it was.
But not anymore?
No.
You were out with Andy Leonard
the night he was arrested.
Nick tell you that?
What, you weren't out with him?
Yeah, I was outwith him. Yeah.
And you weren't selling cocaine?
No, I wasn't.
He was.
Then what were you doing?
I was trying to teach
him how to sell it.
You're serious?
That's what it came to. That fellow,
he's smart enough to be a lawyer...
...but he's way too
dumb to be a crook.
You had to be getting something.
Yeah, he's my lawyer.
Yes.
He's your lawyer, too.
Okay. So he's your lawyer and he's my
lawyer. What does that do for you?
Look, um...
I pretty much knew that you knew...
...what I had done for a living.
I wanted him to let you know...
...that I now had
a legitimate business. Uh...
Naturally, I didn't want him busted
in the meantime.
So you thought Andy Leonard
would give you respectability?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, what do you need it for?
You.
So, uh...
So if I asked you out,
maybe you'd accept.
You don't need a lawyer for that.
Dating is not a criminal activity,
Mr. McKussic. I think your...
...profession has clouded
your judgment here.
I'm flattered and I...
I believe you.
It was awful dumb.
I'm...
I'm late as hell.
Arturo, pour me a
glass of champagne.
You're never gonna
believe what happened.
If it's bad news, I generally believe it.
I went to return Mr. McKussic's money.
You gave back my tip.
I don't believe it.
Good evening, lieutenant.
You're early.
You're late.
Disappointed?
Yeah. What kept you?
You don't want to know.
We're over here.
Uh, no, we're not.
Where do you suggest?
The wine cellar, where else?
Come on. Nick, come on.
Stop kidding around. I mean it.
I have customers all over the place.
I'll scream.
That would be quite
unnecessary, señorita.
Jo Ann Vallenari, may I present Commandante
Xavier Escalante-Portero y Vega...
...of the Mexican <i>Federales.</i>
Pleasure.
Lt. Frescia seems to
have alarmed you.
I surprised Miss Vallenari with a
private party in the wine cellar.
Because I phoned ahead
and made reservations.
She arrived late
and didn't realize we were here.
You go to a good deal of trouble to explain
an inconsequential event, lieutenant.
Hal. You remember
Jo Ann Vallenari.
Yes, of course.
How are you?
Nice to see you.
You were going to
tell me about your day.
Oh, with Mr. McKussic.
You were with Mac? How come?
if this is a professional question...
...I don't want to answer.
Purely personal.
Jovana, please,
the judge is waiting for you.
I'll be right back.
Hi, honey, how are you?
Judge.
I hope we didn't keep you waiting.
Not at all.
Here is a green card for Nino.
I had to pull some strings.
Come on, Nick, Escalante's waiting.
He wants to give you a
token of his friendship.
What?
A gun.
He's Mexican.
What can I tell you?
You wanted someone to ID Carlos.
I've got him for you.
I have worked with Escalante
for eight years.
He does not get involved
in an operation...
...unless he can bring it off.
Don't mess with him.
You can mess with her anytime.
Think it was an accident
Nino was arrested for drunk driving?
Frescia had the police
waiting for him every night.
Why?
He figured you knew more...
...about Mac than you did and he was going
to use Nino to find out what you knew.
How did the judge get involved?
He's the Federal judge Frescia
went to for the deportation order.
I pointed out to the judge he was about
to deport his fettuccine verde...
...his ossobuco
and his rigatoni quattro formaggi.
Our informants assure us that
Carlos will contact McKussic...
...before he goes elsewhere else
to conclude his business.
Would he risk
going to McKussic's house?
Well, he hardly expects me to be
there to identify him, Mr. Maguire.
After all, beaches are a crowded,
friendly place, aren't they?
People don't wear much
in the way of clothing.
Guns and surveillance equipment
are that much more difficult to hide.
Mr. McKussic
thinks about such things.
Which brings me to the point.
A group of Mexicans patrolling
the strand will look conspicuous.
I suggest your people
patrol the beach...
...and keep a wide perimeter with some
sort of frozen surveillance for us.
Where do you wanna be?
There's a lot on the highlands
above his home.
But I'm told Mr. McKussic
has a boat stored on this lot.
That could prove, uh,
awkward.
That can be handled.
How?
With a phone call.
Don't you have to
get back to your party?
In a minute.
Excuse me.
Is there something wrong?
You asking about McKussic,
what did you want to know?
I was asking about you.
I wanted to know why you saw him.
I thought he owed me an explanation.
Did you get it?
Oh, yeah.
Would you like to hear it?
I'm not sure.
Mr. McKussic, it seems,
has been engaged in his business...
...for purely
romantic reasons.
While you, it seems, have been engaged
in romance for purely business reasons.
I'm not sure I understand that.
A little vague for you?
A little.
Then let me spell it out. You want to
fuck your friend? Fuck him, not me.
How you doing?
I gotta go to work, okay?
See you.
Well, is everything okay?
I'll end up irrigating
half the county before this is over.
So who's gonna sit me?
Uh, Ann Marie downstairs.
She's very good.
You ever date her?
Well, no.
I don't date the sitters.
Why couldn't Jo Ann babysit me?
Who?
Jo Ann Vallenari.
How do you know
her name?
Well, she promised to make me
angel hair spaghetti.
Well, I wouldn't count on that now, Cody.
She's a very busy girl.
Well, doesn't she
like you, Dad?
Well, gee, we never really
got around to that. Uh...
How come she doesn't
like you, Dad?
I didn't say she
didn't like me.
I don't know what she likes
or if she likes a goddamn thing.
There's some people
who don't like much of anything.
They just have nice manners
and live, you know?
Cody, take your
shoes off the bed.
What are you doing?
I got a ticket.
Noise abatement ordinance.
Not allowed to do any work
on machinery in the neighborhood.
Haven't worked on this thing in a month.
Anyway, I better move it or they will.
I ran into Rudi
Samudio's customers.
They're desperate
for product.
Not as desperate as Rudi.
He's doing 100 years.
They'll go up to half
a million in advance.
Greg, I couldn't help you if I wanted to,
and I don't want to.
Okay. Okay.
But you got to know
where something is...
...even if it's bad shit.
I mean, Mac, half a million bucks!
Greg, I thought we agreed you weren't gonna
hit me with this kind of stuff anymore.
Why do you keep talking?
I just had a feeling
you were gonna change your mind.
Yeah.
Look, Greg,
enough of this shit, huh?
I got to stick this thing in the water.
See if it floats.
What can I do for you, Jovana?
I'm okay.
You don't have to be
here yet.
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Thanks.
Go home and rest
and come back tonight.
No, I'm fine.
It's okay.
I didn't know you.
I didn't know your relationship with Mac.
I only knew he was hiding something.
It turned out to be his feelings.
But you're so smooth...
...I figured you were hiding
something too.
How could you tell?
You lie to me about Mac.
You lie to Mac about me.
You lie to the judge
about everybody.
Sooner or later, you have to lose
sight of the facts, don't you?
No.
No, you don't lose sight of the
facts, not unless you're nuts.
You just...
You lose sight of
your feelings.
Mac knows how he feels.
He's crazy about you
and doesn't want to get caught.
For a crook, it's crystal clear. On the
other hand, for a cop, it's confusing.
Mac's my friend and I like him.
Maguire's my associate
and I hate him.
I probably have to bust my friend
if I'm gonna do my job and I hate that.
But I hate drug dealers and
somebody's got to get rid of Carlos.
How do I do that?
With my powers of deduction,
I walk into your restaurant...
...take one look at
you and realize...
...no matter how good the food is,
Mac's not here to eat. He's in love.
Then I have to wonder if you're not as
good about concealing your feelings...
...as you are at taking care of your customers.
I know you're not in the drug business.
But you've got guilty knowledge
that can help me do my job.
So I checked you out.
You've had, as near as I can tell,
three affairs in the last seven years.
One with a lifeguard who was more
a high school buddy than anything else.
The other a painter who did
frescoes for your restaurant.
And the third a married man where you broke
off the relationship almost immediately.
So you're not exactly
wild and crazy in this area.
I figured if you got involved with me,
you're probably not involved with Mac.
But given his interest in you...
...you're as likely to find out what's
going on in his life as anybody.
What I didn't figure is
that you're not like me.
You're honest and kind
and principled.
And I trust you.
Suddenly, I'm...
...ashamed.
You're the most beautiful thing I've
ever seen and I'm nuts about you.
Now I've only got one question.
It's not about Mac.
I don't want to know
what you know about Mac.
Man, I just want to see you tonight.
Will you?
See me?
So, what else you
know about me, Nick?
God, didn't somebody
turn the machine on?
No, somebody didn't,
because I'm supposed to do it.
Vallenari's, good morning.
Uh, no, I do too know who it is.
How did you get my number?
I'm really surprised you'd be left alone
all morning without any supervision.
I don't believe you.
Okay. Well, I'll see
what I can do.
Um, I'll be over as
soon as I can.
Okay?
Okay.
Bye.
So, do you think there's a chance?
Of what?
Of seeing you tonight.
Let's play it by ear.
Call me later.
Okay.
<i>We're continuing...</i>
<i>...with the full-spectrum
rock and roll on KMPC-FM.</i>
<i>Beautiful Southern
California day.</i>
<i>I tell you, that song was made

<i>Just, the fantasies come

<i>Looks like the low

<i>Female Caucasian, late 20s.</i>
<i>Fair hair, medium height.</i>
No makeup.
No visible jewelry.
<i>What's she doing?</i>
Right now, she's taking
some cloths out of the car.
Obviously, she's
going back to the house.
<i>Earlier she was cooking spaghetti.</i>
Fancy dish, cooking spaghetti.
<i>How about that call, Hal?</i>
<i>It's okay. our guy is set to drop
off the half million at McKussic's.</i>
<i>Carlos is gonna pick
it up there tonight.</i>
<i>What about McKussic?</i>
<i>Yeah, could
you hold on a second?</i>
Where you going?
Carlos is due at McKussic's.
Not till 12:30.
Jo Ann Vallenari is not an informant, Hal.
I don't want her mistaken for one.
Forget it. She let herself in,
she can let herself out.
I just left half a million dollars with somebody
at the chapel. it was not for religious purposes.
I'm telling you, Nick...
...if you call her, you go anywhere
near Mac's, I'll have you shot.
You hear me?
You mean arrested, don't you, Hal?
<i>I'm sorry, Xavier,
what were you saying?</i>
<i>What about McKussic?
Where's he going to be?</i>
<i>Well, we're not sure.</i>
<i>He hasn't been very cooperative.</i>
<i>But it's no problem. Our guy has
made contact with Carlos directly.</i>
How long have you been here?
How long have you been here?
Mind if we discuss
this somewhere else?
After I got through dealing with
the fact you left him alone...
...Cody admitted he dismissed
the babysitter to get me over here.
I didn't know when you were coming back,
so I called his mother to pick him up.
How did he know where to reach you?
He called the restaurant.
Called the restaurant?
Yes, he called the restaurant.
Care for a glass of wine?
It's not a bad Chardonnay.
Where'd he get the number?
Your bed stand.
I'm late for work.
When was you last time
you saw Nick Frescia?
This morning.
I didn't realize you're
open for breakfast.
When you gonna see him again?
I can't answer that.
That's right, you don't talk about customers.
Especially not after I've slept with them.
If you want to know anything more
about Nick, talk to him.
And he'll tell me to talk to you.
Thanks for the bullshit, Slick.
Did you call me "Slick"?
I'll say.
Okay.
Ask me anything.
Ask anything?
Whatever you want to know about me.
Okay.
Anything, Mr. McKussic.
Listen, mind not calling me Mr. McKussic?
I'll call you anything you want. Contrary
to what everyone seems to think...
...I'm not good at undercover work.
I don't know your first name.
It's Dale. But don't call me that either.
Then don't call me "Slick."
<i> Alpha, Beta, Charlie teams.</i>
<i>We meet at 1020 Western and P.C.H.
Equipment van is waiting.</i>
It's called leaky-pipe irrigation.
Trade name is Hydro-pore.
Hm.
Made from old vulcanized tires.
You stick it about 14 inches under the
soil and it kind of sweats out the water.
I got an order last week for 50,000 feet
from a lemon grower in Encinitas.
I didn't think there were any
groves left in California.
You said she was leaving.
She was.
Well, what's the delay?
<i>They're watering the lawn-</i>
Heh.
Watering the lawn.
So, what do you think?
I think...
...you're a legitimate businessman.
Heh.
Yeah, well, I hope so. If it
doesn't work, I'm a crook forever.
Why haven't you gotten out of
that other before?
It's a lot tougher to
quit than you think.
<i>Just say no.</i>
Nobody wants me to quit.
You know?
Don't quit. Don't get caught.
Stay on top long enough
for us to knock you off.
That's the motto around here.
Nobody wants me to quit.
Cops want to bust me.
The Colombians want my connections.
My wife, she wants my money.
<i>Her lawyer agrees. Mine likes
getting paid to argue with them.</i>
Nobody wants me to quit.
I haven't even mentioned my customers.
You know they don't want me to quit.
That is completely paranoid.
Hey, I'm just talking here.
I'm not trying to convince you
of a damn thing.
I may be paranoid, but then again...
...nobody wants me to quit.
No, I-- I'm sorry.
I was just joking.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Oh, come on.
It didn't hurt that bad.
Just looking at you
hurts more.
I thought you said
she was leaving.
<i>Well, sir, it was a
miscommunication. I'm sorry.</i>
How much longer do
you think she'll be?
I can't leave just yet.
My clothes are still in the dryer.
Okay.
Jesus, God.
Get out of there!
Look, I believe you that
you're out of that other business.
And--
What's that?
Oh, nothing.
It's just my service.
I better call.
Right now?
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
What the fuck
are you doing?
Are you nuts? They're covering me like a
blanket! Didn't I tell you to call first?
Oh, Jesus. Not only that,
you scared the shit out of me!
Get away, this is not funny.
I'm wearing a fucking towel.
You know who is in charge
of all that surveillance out there?
The U.S. Government and
the Federal Republic of Mexico...
...have me watching you
waiting for me to show up.
Which reminds me. I talk into the
wrong one of these, buddy...
...and it costs us
50 years apiece.
Yeah?
I told you, buddy. I told you on
the phone. I take care of everything.
<i>I've been instructed to
tell you that Carlos has entered the house.</i>
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
But you, Mac, I trust with my life.
You keep me waiting all night...
...without showing the slightest sign
of being worried about me.
Forget it. You had your hands full.
I could see that.
What's more, you fuck like a world
champion. Four fucking hours!
Those cops out there are terrified
their wives are gonna hear about this.
I got starved just watching you.
She can cook too, this girl.
Believe me, if she's willing to take out
the garbage, marry her. Trust me, buddy.
You think this the
best idea right now?
When's the next time
we'll get a chance to play?
In jail.
What's going on with you
and Lindroff?
I don't want my cousin
involved in anything.
I realize...
Yeah?
I'll take care of it.
Hello?
Who?
You've got company.
Company?
It's for you.
You've got to be out of here in less
than 20 minutes, for chrissakes.
We're never gonna finish the game!
Vittorio's wife called.
He had to go home.
I've got to go close up.
What are you doing?
There's nothing wrong with Vittorio's wife.
I had Arturo call you.
Jo Ann, listen to me.
Mac is gonna get busted tonight.
There's an informant making sure of that.
Because of what's been going on,
your behavior could be misconstrued.
Misconstrued?
You are in the wrong
place at the wrong time!
That could get you hurt.
Give me your purse.
I want you to, uh,
go inside and lock the door.
Detective Torres will be here
in a few minutes.
He'll take care of you
until this is over.
There.
That's ready to fire.
All you really care about is arresting Mac.
Get inside.
Hey, don't smoke. I got some
kind of leak in the fuel line.
Well, everything's set.
Not quite. Carlos is still at your house.
Wait a minute.
Now I recognize you.
From the restaurant with
Lieutenant Frescia.
Jo Ann Vallenari.
Where is Mr. McKussic?
I recognize this, too.
You gotta watch
out for her.
Is that right?
Oh, yeah.
She's friendly with a cop
that knows Mac.
Where is Mac, by the way?
You think she could be dangerous?
Be some sort of informant?
I do.
Mac's nuts about her.
He wouldn't see it.
That's terrible.
Have you mentioned this to him?
Oh, yeah!
I do what I can for Mac.
Well.
It's all here.
Yes, it is.
Speaking of information...
...you were busted by the Drug
Enforcement Agency four months ago.
You didn't happen to mention that
to Mac, did you? No, I didn't think so.
What a shame.
When you're in trouble, people need to talk
to somebody. if it's not their friends...
...it's usually your enemies.
Federal narcotics number 7-2-4-4.
<i>Maguire claims he's the one
that has contact with Mac's cousin?</i>
Yeah, why?
<i>At 7:00, we spotted a couple...</i>
<i>...of Escalante's men with Mac's cousin.</i>
Near the Wayfarer's chapel?
Right.
<i>Jesus.</i>
He's got some
interesting holes in him.
He went down,
what can I tell you?
For only getting hit
once or twice...
...he sure got him in the best spots,
wouldn't you say?
All right, who fired their gun?
Everybody to the edge of the pier.
Let's go, let's have a show of hands.
Come on, people, hands in the air!
How the fuck did this guy get dead?
Escalante's men got here ahead of us.
That's when there was gunfire.
This stinks.
It's gas fumes. So what?
<i>You know...</i>
...I've been hearing for months now
how Carlos was real upset because...
...he shipped cocaine on a tanker where it got
soaked in gasoline and he couldn't sell it.
What is this?
Yeah.
Twelve-hundred kilos exactly. I think you
just paid half a million for it, Hal.
You're full of shit, Frescia. Carlos
wouldn't go to that trouble for half--
Half a million dollars? Probably not, but
who knows what he's really up to, huh?
I mean, your snitch
isn't gonna tell us.
Where's Escalante?
I don't know.
He said something about
going back to his boat.
His boat?
He sailed up here from Ensenada.
Said he wanted to go fishing
for albacore on the way home.
Gone fishing?
Yeah.
What is wrong with that?
Escalante is Carlos,
you miserable shit.
She works hard
at a fashionable restaurant...
...but never takes the time
to enjoy a good meal.
She starts taking the time.
She enjoys it.
She goes from one customer
to another...
...from your friend Nick Frescia
to his friend Dale McKussic to...
...who knows?
I'm sure the girl has
friends of her own.
The point is she's discarded
her traditional values.
She's lost.
Then she uses cocaine,
for chrissake.
Naturally, she dies.
It's an American tragedy.
Don't worry, buddy,
I won't kill her unless you approve.
And if I don't approve?
Then we talk until you do.
Come on, when was the last time
we smoked some really good shit, huh?
Come on.
Life is serious enough.
Where is she?
I should be the one calling you for
help. It's been rowdy down here tonight.
What's up?
We've got to find a boat.
Probably out of Ensenada. Put in
for mooring in the last five days.
You want me to call
every harbor master...
...between here and Mexico?
Yeah.
<i>Torres
at Vallenari's. She's not here, Nick.</i>
Check McKussic's and get
back to me right away.
Yeah, this is
Woody Trainer, Tyler 12.
Why would I do something like that?
What for? What would I gain?
Believe me, Jo Ann,
we've been sitting here...
...doing nothing but asking ourselves
that same question.
I haven't seen any matador stand his ground
in front of the horns like that since Abruza.
He's a pussy.
He's the finest matador in Mexico.
He's a pussy, man.
Heh.
Why is that, buddy?
I don't know why.
Look at him.
I mean, look at the matador, man.
What does he fucking do?
He dresses up in his little...
...spangles and puts on
his fucking sequined jacket...
...and wraps that sash
around his waist.
Then puts on his little
pink stockings...
...and his hair up in a little pigtail.
I mean, that's a pussy.
Agh. Whoa.
I mean, that's what a bullfight is.
It's saying he's a pussy.
And we're the bull.
They got that thing
and they wave it like a red flag.
What do we do?
We charge that sucker!
And so they always
got the edge.
They know what we're gonna do.
We're predictable.
They're just gonna
stick it in...
...and break it off.
There's not a fucking thing to say.
Bravo, buddy!
What are we gonna
do about it?
What are we gonna do about it? You die.
You fucking die. That's what you do.
Wait, I've seen him this way.
He's very serious.
Are you coming with me
or are you gonna stick around here?
This is a tragic fucking
mistake, buddy.
She'll testify and she'll get us all.
She's the only one who can.
What are you gonna do about that?
What about your boy, family, friends?
What are you gonna do?
Get in the boat.
I urge you to reconsider.
Meet me at Pier 17. Stay up on
channel 12. I'll tell you when.
Son of a bitch.
Could you go down below
and get me a flashlight?
I think there's one near
the companionway. -Mac?
Can you do that right now, please?
We haven't got all night here.
How about that light?
Could you turn it on?
Here. Just, right--
Could you hold it, please?
Right, just there.
That's an awful lot of money.
Shit. Fifteen million dollars.
That's an awful lot of money.
Yeah, well.
Money makes people predictable, at least.
They're never gonna be reliable.
There's nothing Nick doesn't know about me.
I didn't talk about you.
Forget it.
I don't want to forget.
I don't care what you want.
Soon as I drop you off...
...you better take a long vacation
to Bora Bora...
...because you're never
gonna live to testify.
I was never going to testify.
You're telling me.
Mac, I'd die before
I'd hurt you.
Well, that was being arranged.
If you believe what Carlos said,
why didn't you let him kill me?
Why did you do what you did?
Could you hold the
light, please?
Could--?
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Mac.
Ugh.
Mac, I love you.
You got to stop talking,
you know?
I got to fix this boat
or somebody will get killed.
Let me put it to you like this. Shut up
or I'll smack you. Now hold the light.
I love you.
Agh! Damn it!
Mac, I love you.
Don't say that again.
I love you.
I love you.
I tell you right now, Nick...
...if we find McKussic
anywhere near Escalante...
...I'm gonna put him
away for 25 years.
That's not what we agreed on.
You're reneging on a deal.
You are a lying no-good cocksucker
and a four-flushing son of a bitch.
But, no matter.
Hang on a sec.
You didn't tell me Mac was involved.
What difference does that make?
Mac's a friend.
He's a drug smuggler.
What do you mean, Frescia?
Let's see.
You've lost half a million dollars,
confiscated a ton of useless coke...
...and been responsible for the murder of a
federal informant, and that's just tonight.
That's all bullshit, and you know it.
Well have you thought about this?
Mac can identify
Escalante as Carlos...
...and prove you've been partners
with the biggest drug dealer...
...in Mexico for eight years,
whether you knew it or not.
And when you put Mac away,
he puts you away.
Any luck, Woody?
Yeah, see you.
I got to go post warning signs.
Can you give me a hand?
Yeah, sure.
Oh, it's gonna make
for messy headlines, Hal.
At least the CIA does it on purpose.
When will I see you?
Well...
How about dinner?
What time do you want
your reservation?
Seven thirty?
I'll put it down.
Anything else I can do?
Marry me.
Let's go.
Let's do it now.
Hey, Woody. Nick,
thanks for showing up.
How did you two get here?
Boat. Could you excuse us?
Did Woody have any trouble
getting ahold of you?
No, none at all.
I need you to look
after her for a while.
Either you tell me where Carlos is
right now...
...or you become an accessory
to your cousin's murder.
Nick, don't-- Look--
Mac, you're under arrest.
I hate to pull a gun on you
but that's the way it is.
Oh, well, at this point, that's nothing new.
I mean, here's another gun you pulled.
Well I don't believe you'll use that.
Yeah, I know how you feel, Nick.
I don't get it.
I mean, you're not this stupid, Mac.
I caught you.
You can't pretend you're not caught.
What, are you gonna spend your life
in Mexico? You can't hide there, either.
You got one chance, buddy.
Turn yourself in.
What for?
What for?
Yeah, what for?
I told you I had an accounting
problem in the restaurant.
I've been holding money for someone and
he's here to pick it up. It's his money.
I want to get this straight.
You'd kill me over drug money?
Well, it's a lot of money.
What's it gonna be, Nick?
Man, I can't believe this.
I really can't believe this.
I can't believe what you've done
with your fucking life!
I can't believe what you've done.
You figure you can do anything
you want, just like Carlos.
You try to fuck her,
he tries to kill her.
Woody's the only one of us worth
anything. He's got a decent job.
I'll be back in an hour
and you can lock me up.
Hey. Hey!
Oh, shit.
You lied to me.
You wouldn't shoot me over money.
Jo Ann, you gotta tell
me where Mac's gone.
Why should I?
He's going to try to kill Carlos
because Carlos is trying to kill you.
Ensenada, this is Little Red.
I'm approaching Pier 17.
Ensenada, this is Little Red
approaching Pier 17. Over.
...pier 17...
...pier 17...
You son of a bitch!
How could you do this?
Friendship is the only choice
in life you can make that's yours!
You can't choose your family!
Goddamn it, I've had to face that!
No man should be judged for
whatever direction his dick goes!
That's like blaming a compass
for pointing north, for chrissake!
Friendship is all we have.
We chose each other.
How could you fuck it up?
How could you make
us look so bad?
Welcome aboard.
Here. Careful,
it's loaded.
Keep it. You're gonna spend
the rest of your life in jail.
I'm not gonna be there to take care
of you. I'll be in a Mexican jail.
She's never gonna testify.
How can you say that, goddamn you?
Not against her husband, and if she can't
testify against me, she can't you.
She's gonna marry you? She said?
Yeah.
Oh, no! No! No!
Under the circumstances,
she would have said anything!
She would have
fucked a snake!
Come on now, be serious!
I am serious.
Don't you even want to check the--
You know, wanna check below?
When it comes to money,
buddy, I trust you.
So, how are we gonna do this?
Well, I...
I don't feel like
unloading $15 million.
What do you say
we swap boats?
That is not exactly fair.
This is a real nice boat.
The hell With it.
So this is it, huh?
I hope she's worth it.
And I hope she keeps her mouth shut.
That's all I can say.
Get out of here.
No, don't. Hold it.
I got that thing rigged
to blow sky high.
Oh, God. I'm sorry. I hated like hell having
to do that, but I didn't want her hurt.
You mind undoing it?
Sure.
Well, look at it this way. If you tried
anything, we both would have gone.
You love her that much?
Well, uh...
Yeah.
When I first heard that, I thought
you rigged the butane stove.
Well, I thought of that.
Uh, yeah, butane stove.
But that's a little too
hard to control.
No, the ignition
system is best.
You knew?
I know you, buddy.
Yeah, well,
could you hand me the--
Shit.
Oh, Jesus Christ,
look at that! You shot me.
So what?
You shot me.
Look at that! Look at my stomach!
You went too far, goddamn it!
Because you're my friend, that means
you get to kill anybody you want?
What the fuck is that?
Will you stop talking? It's making me sick.
Jesus, that looks bad,
don't it?
That's what I've been telling you,
for chrissake.
Oh, shit.
Now I got to get you a doctor.
Wait, wait. Don't move. Don't move.
Wait a minute.
I feel seasick.
I think it's time for
both of us to quit.
I know.
I've seen it coming for some time.
Cocaine is no damn good for anybody.
The future...
The future is grass.
Grass, buddy!
I got 60 ton of Thai
stick coming in.
It's on the way.
Oh, no.
Don't do this, goddamn it!
Don't do this.
Goddamn it.
Oh, fuck.
Freeze! I said freeze!
I'm unarmed! Don't shoot!
I'm unarmed.
Sure.
I'm turning myself in!
Sure, go ahead.
Goddamn it! Stay still!
The fuck are you doing,
Maguire? Hey!
He's turning himself in!
Let it go, Hal!
Mac!
<i>Jo Ann? Nick.</i>
<i>Before you open for dinner,
can you meet me down by Tower 12?</i>
<i>Attention.
We have a strong riptide in this area.</i>
<i>And all lifeguards
will be off duty soon.</i>
<i>For your own safety,
please stay out of the water.</i>
How's our friend?
Fine.
<i>Fine?</i>
Aside from a concussion
and powder burns...
...and being generally
pissed off, yeah.
Did my name come up?
<i>Repeatedly.</i>
Well, they're probably talking
about me right now.
