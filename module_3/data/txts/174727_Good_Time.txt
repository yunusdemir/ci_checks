you're the man with all the action.
What do l gotta do to get a bag like that?
What do l gotta do to get a bag like you?
(phone ringing)
(singing ''Hava Nagila'"
Ooh, ooh, my fuckin' balls are blue!
(cheering)
Whoo!
( electronica)
Damn, you're hot.
- What's your name?
- l don't know.
Heat it up.
Gonna burn the place up, dude.
l'll burn as much as l want.
By the '70s, the big bang theory
was already well established.
So they tried to come up with alternative
scenarios for the universe's evolution,
like, what if you mess around with gravity
or strength of the electromagnetic force?
What do you think that will do
to the universe's evolution?
- Nothing.
- Wrong, dumbass.
Even the slightest tinkering
derails the whole process.
You're just focusing on what you want to.
There's just as much evidence
for a random universe,
that life is completely insane and chaotic.
What are you talking about, man?
Even the most seemingly random events
have logic behind them.
As far as my life goes,
l know exactly what l'm doing.
Geniuses don't make mistakes.
They instigate their own problems
so they can be worked out
for deeper insight.
Chaos is harder to embrace.
lt's scary to think there's no one out there
looking out for us.
Just smoke, man.
(monitor beeping)
- Hey.
- Hey.
(beeping continues)
- Come here to Mama.
- lt's been a long night.
l really gotta get going.
- (door opens)
- Carl?!
- Christine, who the fuck is this?!
- Carl...
Shut up, bitch.
You been gone two fucking days!
- Don't! Leave him alone!
- Come on, l didn't do anything!
- Shut up and get out!
- l don't even know her name!
Hey, man, come on, l...
(flatline)
- (Max) Let's get out of here.
- Where we goin', man?
(Max) l got an idea.
Tuck that shit in, man.
(doorbell rings)
- Yes?
- Uh, hi, uh... Jo.
Uh, yeah, l'm-l'm Max. Adam's brother?
Remember we met one time?
Oh, yes. You shat on the carpet.
- ls-is Adam here?
- No, he's not back from work yet.
Um... well, could we wait for him?
Uh...
(woman) Blood pressure's dropping.
l need some more suction.
l can't see.
- 1 1 0 over 70.
- Not there, here.
1 00 over 60.
(flatline)
- l need another clamp.
- Hell, we just lost the pulse.
Open up the lVs full bore.
(no audio)
(T-Ray sneezes)
(whispers) Fuck.
(snorts)
Oh, yeah, that's it. Yeah.
- (door opens)
- Put that away. Put that away.
Hey, Adam.
How you doin'?
What the fuck are you doin' here?
l... l just came by
so we could go visit Dad.
- He's dead.
- Aw, shit.
- We all missed you at the funeral.
- You guys had a funeral without me?
What the fuck do you care?
You wouldn't have come anyway.
Yeah, l would have.
You know l was with him to the very end?
He could have cared less.
All he kept asking for was you.
l'm sorry. Look, if it was Mom,
you know she would have asked for you.
Would it have been so hard
to just jump on a plane?
One time, do the right thing.
Just... just once.
l'm sorry. There was a lot of traffic.
l couldn't meet you.
Oh, you-you fucking liar!
ls nothing important to you?
- l really wanted to be there.
- Bullshit!
l did. l'm here now.
A-A-Are you OK?
No, Max, l'm not OK.
Are you gonna take care of me?
That's a fuckin' joke. Get out.
- What?
- Get out!
- ls that how you want it?
- Get the fuck out!
( ''El Lado Oscuro de mi Compadre''
by Terrestre of the Nortec Collective)
- Get the signed consent?
- Got it right here.
- X-rays?
- Uh, no.
- Where the fuck are they?
- Radiology.
You want me to get 'em?
Maybe we should ask the patient.
Has everybody else done their job today?
(horn blares)
- Hey, Cohen.
- Yeah?
- Sorry l yelled earlier.
- lt's OK. lt's my fault.
No, you're doing great.
lt's just that l have a temper sometimes.
But l'm working on it.
OK.
Dr. Verbinski,

l'll be right there.
(laughs. imitates cat
Oh, yeah. That's it. Good.
(siren)
(siren chirps)
(woman. faint Max?
Max?
(gasps)
- (police radio chatter
- (Max yells)
(beep. Jo's voice)
Adam. Max just called. He's in jail.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what to tell him.
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure.
So what does your attorney say?
Uh, well, l mean,
he said l'll probably be out
in, like, six months on parole.
l mean, l'll have to do community service
for, like, the rest of my life,
but... well, at least l'll be free.
But at least l'm clean. l mean,
l haven't used since l got in here.
Oh, congratulations.
Yeah, did they, uh, throw a party for ya?
How you doin'?
l'm fine.
Oh.
Well, what are you gonna do
when you get out of here?
l don't know.
l'll think of something.
l'm always resourceful.
l want you to come stay with me.
- Really?
- Yeah.
OK.
OK.
l'll... l'll do it.
Thanks.
l'm glad you're my brother.
l'm glad you're my brother.
We, uh, set up a room for you.
Wow. This is really great.
- l don't know what to say.
- Oh, no problem.
Uh, dinner's at 7:00 sharp.
Adam likes to eat on time.
OK.
l'm really grateful.
Adam's orders.
So just let me know if you need anything,
and l'll be in the kitchen.
- OK.
- OK.
Doctor, your glove.
Let me get you another one.
Doctor?
Are you OK?
Yeah.
Yeah, l'm just tired.
- You don't look OK.
- l'm fine.
Adam, can l, uh, can l speak to you
outside in the hallway for a second?
No, all right?
Now just... put the patient under.
(Jo) Something's wrong.
We have to talk about this at some point.
(Adam) Yeah, well, you know what?
l don't want to.
Hi, Max.
Hi.
You sure you're all right?
Yeah.
OK.
Why don't you swing by the hospital
tomorrow around noon?
We can have lunch together.
OK.
All right.

Dr. Adam Verbinski.
OK.

- Yeah.
l don't know what l was thinking.
l'm not even hungry.
- What are you doin'?

So, what, you don't wanna go?
- (man) Adam? lt's over, son.
- Can l help you?
- Dr. Verbinski?
- Yes.
l'm Lieutenant Lally.
l have a warrant for your arrest.
They showed me this tape.
Your privileges are suspended.
These gentlemen will escort you
from the premises.
l'm not going anywhere.
Get out of my office!
- Turn around. Take it easy.
- Get the fuck away from me!
- Get off me!
- Dr. Verbinski, please.
- Open your hands!
- What's goin' on?! Where you takin' him?
(musical interlude)
(no audio)
Find myself a pretty lady...
...big home, nice car,
baby.
l don't know.
lt's not really that important right now.
(clears throat Lotta work to do.
(Max) You got work to do?
Yeah, l got work to do.
So do you.
Get your shit together.
You're this close, man.

- (grunts)
l said, ''You're this close.''
To what?
- To gettin' your shit together.

Think Mom... really misses me?
Course she does.
She loves you.
(door opens)
Hey!
Hey, sorry l'm late, man.
What happened?
My license has been suspended.
l can't practice medicine for two years.
Oh, man.
Plus, Jo kicked me out.
l'm sorry.
What are you gonna do?

Well, if you want, you can come stay
at my apartment till you figure it out.
l mean, it ain't much,
but... l got a job.
l'm movin' on up.
- Let me show it to you right now.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- You're welcome to stay there.
- Great.
Hey, l've matured since the last time.
- l've matured.
- l don't know.
(Max) Come on.
Look, let me take care
of you for a while.
We'll go to meetings together.
We'll be just a couple of geniuses
hanging out.
- (Adam) Maybe.
- Ha.
- l just know that l'm very humble.
- (laughs) Humble, my ass!
l'm just proud of how humble l am,
that's all.
You should be humble.
Turn the lights down
Trouble's gone now
As far as I can see
Let the healing begin
Let the pain escape
Comfort settles in
(song ends)
