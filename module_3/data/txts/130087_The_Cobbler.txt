You're a good-looking guy,
Gotta good job,
That kid's got nothing on you,
He's got his own driver,

I don't know,
Maybe it's about time I figured

You're a cobbler,

And his father before that,
You should be proud,

Action Committee,
Okay.
Basically, we're dedicated to
the preservation
and rejuvenation
of the Lower East Side,
We're trying to stop
real estate developers
from converting the
neighborhood
into luxury housing
and retail spaces,
forcing the regular
people out,
- How are they forcing them out?,
- Money,
I mean, they buy them out
or they raise the rent,
How much do you think I'd get
for a place like this?,
That doesn't matter,
It does to me,
Max, we need people
like you to stay,
That's why we're doing
all of this,
Well, maybe you should've
checked with me first,
make sure I wanna stay,
Yeah, that's fair,
You know what, come here,
I'm gonna show you something,
Look around you, Max,
What do you see?,
- The city,
- Exactly,
The city, a living city,
And your shop
is a part of it,
How long have you had
this shop for, Max?,
Fourth generation,

a playground for the rich,
It is for all of us,
- Don't you think?,
- Yeah, I guess,
Good,

No, not at all, he's black,
And you said that you killed him
with a,,, stiletto heal,
Yes, that's right, six inch
platform, molded plastic,

reinforcement.

the trick, unfortunately,
Right, Right,
The body is just right
in the living room,
You might wanna
stay out here, It's,,,
It's pretty ugly in there,
What the hell?,
The body was right here,

go give it back, all right?,
No, Hey!, Hey!, Hey!, Hey!,
Whoa!, Whoa!,
Damn it, Jimmy,
Why'd you do that?,
'Cause I'm trying to stop you
from screwing up your life,
Your shop's closed half the
time, you're acting all crazy,
I'm not blind, Max, I know where
this is going, I've seen it before,
You have not
seen this before, trust me,
Oh, yes I have and you know
with who?, Your father,
- My father?,
- Yeah,
He was acting just like
you are before he took off,
What are you saying?,
Listen, your old man,

with some bad people
and he had to disappear,
had to make them think that he
was dead and never coming back
or else they were gonna
hurt you, hurt your mother,
You knew this all this time
and you didn't tell me?,
How come you didn't tell me?,
He made me
promise not to.
He what?
He said that I was
the only one he could trust,
What,,, the hell
are you doing, kid?,
New rules, Jimmy!,
You stay out of my business,
you hear me?,
Max, I just don't want you
to make the same mistakes
your old man did,

I know it sounds crazy
but I'm not crazy,
You've got to believe me,
Max, I'm gonna ask you this
one time
and I want you
to tell me the truth,
Are you making this all up
just to get with me?,
What?, No, I swear,

but I'm telling you the truth,
OK, so who are these people?,
Do you know any names?,
The woman's name is Greenawalt,
Elaine Greenawalt?
Yeah, that's,,,
You know her?,
Yeah, Her company owns
Mr, Solomon's building,
She's got a pretty nice
place upstate too,
You went to her house?,
This is the building.
Once he's gone, they can
sell the whole block.
It's worth a fortune.
Wow. You really think
you can stop them?
Of course I do.
I told you, Max, I'm a badass.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Come on, he lives
on the third floor.
He 's the last one left.
See?, Everyone's gone,

They said they would burn
your building down
with you
in it, so, yeah,
You believe him?,
Yeah, I do,
Hm.
Thank you very much for telling
me this, but I can't leave,
Are you kidding me?,
These are bad people,
Mr, Solomon,

messing around,
Max, my wife and I lived

her off the Sears Tower tonight,

Care to tell me

and threaten to kill his
daughter in Chicago,
I'm not in Chicago,
I didn't say that,
No?, Oh, because we have it
all on tape,
I could play it back
for you right now, Live,
I did not give consent to being
filmed for television right now,
You set this up
and I will make you pay,
Maybe they got duck ragu
in prison,
You son of a bitch!,
Hi,
I came to get
Emiliano's shoes,
Oh, yeah,
- Uh, new soles,
- Perfect,
He's gonna be happy,
He wanted to wear them tonight,
Oh, yeah?, Going out
on a big date?,
No, it's boy's night,
Huh, No charge,
Really?, That's really sweet,
Thank you,
Thank you,
- Hi, Max.
- Hi, Carmen.
My favorite boots,
I busted the zipper and l
thought they were goners
and then I remembered
that I knew a badass cobbler,
Ah, well,
these are good shoes,
I could do something
with these,
Yeah, work your magic,
So I talked to Mr, Solomon
this morning,
Oh, yeah?, How's he doing?,
He said he's having a wonderful
time and that when he comes home
he wants
to thank you in person,
Oh, well, OK,
How'd you pull it off, Max?,
Pull what off?,
Solomon, Greenawalt,
all of it,
Here's your ticket,
- Thanks,
- Don't lose it,
So do you have plans
next Friday night?,
No, why?,
You having another rally?,
No, I would like
to have dinner with you,
Would you like to have dinner
with me, Max?,
Yeah, sure, yeah,
Got a pen?,
Here's my number,
Don't lose it,
I won't,
Good,
Bye, Max,
Bye, Carmen,
- Shit,
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it,
I'm not here to hurt you,
Bullshit, Leave me alone,
Wait, I'm not staying,
I just wanted to give you these,
Take 'em,
You're giving me
your watches?,
Sell 'em,
They're worth a lot,
Why are you doing this?,
I'm sorry for what I did,
You deserve better,
Much better,
Hey, man,
you got a light?,
- No,
- I do,
Let's go,
- Hello, Leon. Remember me?
- Rat prick?
My name is Patrick,
you piece of shit, Patrick,
Time for some payback,
OK, hold up,
just let me take my shoe off--
Don't worry about your shoes,
You're not gonna need them,
- But I let you go,
- Well, we all make mistakes,
You look like crap,
by the way, Let's go,
You smell like crap too,
You been rolling around
in the garbage, Leon, hmm?,
Well, you should've stayed--
Hey, look out!,
Where am l?,
You're in my shop,
How did I get here?,
Here. Drink.
You took quite a knock,
What happened, Jimmy?,
You were in a car accident,
I found you, pulled you out,
Have a pickle.
No, I'm good,
Just take one,
I don't want a pickle,
I don't care if you want one,
you need it,
Just take one,
What are you talking about,
I need it?,
Pickles preserve you
when you change, Max,
They give you strength,
Otherwise, you get all screwed
up, jumping from body to body,
- You know?,
- Of course I know,
Who do you think got rid
of that putz, Ludlow?,
That stiletto heel
made quite a mess, kid,
That was you?, How?,
You see, the thing is,
I'm not just a barber, Max,
I'm also a cobbler,
And,,,
I'm your father,
- Pop?,
- That's right, Max,
- But you're,,,
- No, I'm right here,
Ah,
- Hold it,
- What?,
You were right next door
to me the whole time
and you didn't tell me?,
I wanted to tell you,
Yeah, but you should've,
I was all alone,
And Ma, Ma never knew,
She thought you were dead
or something,
I felt like I was dead, all that
time on the outside looking in,
Because you left us,
No, because I didn't have
a choice, Max,
- You had a choice,
- Will you try to understand?,
No!, I don't understand!,
I don't understand,
I don't understand any of this!,
Maxie, I wanted to tell you
so many times
but it was
too dangerous,
If it was so dangerous
why are you telling me now, huh?,
Because it's time,
it's time you knew the truth,
You're ready,
- I'm ready?,
- That's right, son,
For what?,
What are you talking about?,
Come to the basement, Max,
You need to see something,
See what?,
Your birthright,
You've gotta be kidding me,
As my father's shoes worked
for me, mine will work for you,
Who are all these people?,
Customers, They help us
to help others,
They're all labelled,
Derek Jeter?,
That one was for me,
- Pop, you made all these shoes?,
- Oh, no, no, no,
These shoes go
all the way back
to your great-grandfather
Pinchas,
He passed them on
to my father Herschel,
Just as I'm passing it
on to you,
It's a privilege to walk
in another man's shoes, Max,
but it's also
a responsibility,
I think you've
learned that by now,
You are a guardian
of soles, Max,
You are the cobbler,
This is your thing,
I missed you, Max,
I really missed you,
Pop,,,
I'm,,,
Listen to me, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry about Ma,
I didn't mean,,,
- Oh,
- I didn't know,
I'm the one who left,
I made the mistakes,
And you,,,
,,,you did right by her,
By me, You did right,
Ah,
It's been a long day,
What do you say we
close up shop and go home,
Yeah, let's go home,
Son, I can't go out the front,
not like this,
Let's go out
the back,
What back?,
This back,
Wow,
I don't believe it,
Believe it,
It beats the subway,
Pop, this is yours?,
Ours, Webb,
this is my son, Max,
- Nice to meet you, Max,
- Hi, Webb,
Webb, we're heading home
to Brooklyn,
- Very good, sir,
- Did Jimmy have this place?,
No, no, no, no, I put this in
after I bought Jimmy out,
- Where is he?,
- The Caribbean, He sends his regards,
You know, barbers have always
been very trusted friends to us,
We never have
to worry about 'em,
Oh, who do we have
to worry about?,
- Dry cleaners,
- Dry cleaners, really?,
They're not nice fellas
and they're very powerful,
Wow,
Well, uh,,,
So, Pop, you mean,
we're not the only ones?,
No, no, no.
There's plenty of tradesmen
like us out there,
some good, some bad.
And it's been that way
for centuries.
Tomorrow, we'll sit down
with the stitcher
and I'll show you everything.
Aw, man, that thing is
great, Pop. Where did we get it?
The stitcher? Oh, that's
a good story, actually.
A long time ago, on the coldest
of winter nights,
a vagrant came knocking
at the door of our shop.
Your great-great-grandfather
gave him shelter
when no one else would.
He fed the man,
mended his shoes...
