Woman: Mr. Leigh, she's

How do I look?
Beautiful.
Really?
I want to come with you.
You can't.
God has plans for you.
Really?
Yeah. Big plans.
He told me Himself.
You're capable of things...

I love you.
And I love you, too.

Vivian Hades.
I'm Head of Mission Resources at USIC.
David Morgan sent me personally.
What does he want?
He wants you to join the project.
Are you joking?
I've been against
Oasis from the start...
some life raft in space for the 1%.
David remembers your passion very well.
My guess is that's why
he wants you up there now.
Up there?
What happened to a world
without the treacherous
illusion of faith?
Wasn't that a major feature
of what you wanted Oasis to be?
It was.
Things have changed.
This transmission came
through on the shoot,
late last night.
Peter... [panting]
David Morgan.
I know what you think of me,
USIC, this whole project.
You were right. I didn't know.
When I came here, I didn't know
it's not just about saving the Earth.
It's about so much bigger,
so much bigger than I ever knew.
What I realize is...
we need a spiritual
presence up here now.
We need a man of God,
and it absolutely has to be you.
[static]
The Oasis Project represents
everything my wife and I
fought against for years. No.
David authorized me
to make a sizeable...
I don't want his money.
... donation to your church.
Your work here could continue...
and flourish.
But it's obviously up to you.

Traveling to the edge of the galaxy

David: While our

Oasis can be a new beginning.

10% substrate water is the lowest

We're at 15% now.
It's five, seven weeks max

Not the cactuses, Murray,

Chief, why aren't we drilling?
There's water in the ground.
Let's go and get it, for Christ's sake.
Morgan's orders were clear.

Nah. three for me, honey.
Water's like gold dust up here

No, it's what they're drilling into.

And how often does that happen?
That's very cute.
Uh, the reason I ask
is because the air
is breathable up here,
but it is way too dry,
so it really fucks up
your nasal membrane.
You may also suffer
some visual impairment,
due to the change in atmosphere
and pressure on the optic nerve,
so there's some light sensitivity,
hallucinations, and headaches.

Yeah. Sure does.

To those who have just arrived,

My name is Vikram Danesh.
I'm the chief executive
officer here on Oasis.
I'm from Mumbai.
They call it the city of dreams.
But this is the real city of dreams...
right here.
More like nightmares.
I won't lie to you.
- Water's in short supply.
- What do you mean, nightmares?
Exactly what I said.
He didn't mean anything. Forget it.
You all are playing a very crucial part
in the most visionary building
project ever attempted...
the first permanent colony...
on a new world.
Once completed,
Oasis will be home to 50,000 families.
You are joining at a very critical time.
Drilling for water has been disrupted.
But we have overcome every obstacle
from the beginning of this project.
And I'm confident,
if we all work together,
we will overcome this as well.
[sparse applause]
One last thing.
I want to extend a very warm welcome
to our... new base chaplain Peter Leigh.
- Reverend.
- Man: Can we return him
and get a hooker instead?
- [laughter]
- Woman: Male or female?
For you, motherfucker,
I'd get a fucking sheep with a bell.
[laughter]
Hello.
I know a lot of you probably
don't have much use for religion.
What makes you think that?
[laughter]
I didn't, either, for a
major portion of my life.
I'll be honest. I wear
a collar sometimes.
But I still have doubts. Big ones.
If anyone tells you they don't,
they're lying.
Because life is mysterious,
uh, death more so,
and I don't pretend to
have all the answers.
I look around me now,
and all I see are brave faces
that have come so far from your homes,
families, your children,
to risk so much on behalf
of generations of human
beings that you'll never meet
but who will owe you...
everything.
That's inspiring to me.
I just hope I can give
some inspiration back.
If anyone wants to talk,
I'll be in the...
Where will I be?

Not quite sure why that's funny,
but that's where I'll be.
God bless.

So what kind of chaplain
are you? Catholic?
You damn sure ain't Baptist.
You Church of Satan?
- Ecumenical.
- Ecumenical?
- The fuck is that?
- It means I'm a Christian,
but I believe in the
validity of all denominations.
Excluding the Church
of Satan. How 'bout you?
Well, I guess I'm Ecumenical too.
I believe in fives, tens,

And if they still make them

Danesh: What exactly did
David Morgan say to you
for you to come here, Peter?
Just that he needed a man of God.
That's all?
And that it had to be me.
Where is he?
Exploring.
So why are you searching his room?
Let me be honest with you, Reverend...
we haven't heard from David
Morgan for more than a week.
And I'm concerned for his safety.
David often spends time
alone exploring the planet.
But after the storm
yesterday, I fear the worst.
What do you think's happened to him?
David has been acting
erratically for a while.
Missions like this
are a tricky business.
It took millions of years
for people to look up to the stars,
and not feel terrified.
The changing of the seasons,
the waxing and waning of the moon,
the circling of the constellations.
All these regular patterns
made people feel at home
within the cosmos.
Take the patterns away.
Sleep under unfamiliar stars
far from home...
and people with a fragile mind...
can feel those cosmic terrors
return with a vengeance.
You think he's lost his mind?
First, he orders me to stop drilling
when he knows we're
terribly short of water.
And then I ask him to
send me an engineer,
and he sends me a priest,
before disappearing into the desert.
Freda in distance: Mommy!
Where are you?
I'm scared!
No!
Mommy!
Freda?
Danesh: Does this sound like
the actions of a sane man?
Well, that's not for
me to say now, is it?
David Morgan founded this colony.
And now he's brought it
to the brink of extinction.
I won't let anyone
else endanger my crew...
and the success of this mission.
Do you understand?
Perfectly.
Mommy!

There's enough antibiotics
here to treat an army.
There was blood all over the windshield.
We need to put a search party together.
He cut the tracker out of his own arm.
He doesn't want to be found.
So we leave him to die out there?
At this stage...
that might be the best
thing for all of us.
Ask Phelps to assemble a crew.
We'll start drilling
again in the morning.
I was hired to ensure
everybody's safety on the base,
which includes Morgan.
You were hired because you
fucked up as a police detective,
and USIC bailed you out.
You refused to follow orders then.
Don't make the same mistake again.
Halloran: Are you a betting man, Father?
Peter: I am not. Are you?
I didn't have much choice
growing up with my old man.
He used to take me to
the track as a nipper.
The bit I loved best was
the paddock before the race.
You get to see the horses up close.
Oh, just beautiful.
So I bought one as a foal.
Determinator.
Beautiful beast he was.
White with these bright brown eyes.
I tell you, you look
into those eyes, Father,
and you knew that horse had a soul.
You just knew.
Anyway, came the big
day, the Doncaster Cup.
I thought, this is it. This is
my chance to win it all back.
Because he was... you
know, he was a runner.
Hmm.
But I want sure that was enough.
So I paid a dodgy vet
to milkshake him the
night before the cup.
He was leading with 200 to go,
then he collapsed 10
yards from the line,
foaming at the mouth.
Whatever it was we'd
given him fucked his heart.
I ran out onto the track.
He was screaming out in agony,
looking up at me with those eyes.
[exhales]
I put a bullet in his head.
Saddest thing I ever saw.
Worst thing I ever did.
We all make mistakes.
That's in the past now.
I've seen him... up here.
I've seen him... Determinator.
Our imaginations can sometimes...
I have no imagination.
No, it's this place.
