It's on.
- Thanks.
- Good morning.
- Did anybody see me come in?
- I don't think so.
- I did.
- Fuck off, Bert.
Okay. Now, young
man, look here.
All of this, okay?
You could get a hit
off of any of these
and change the whole
investigation.
I mean, this is a very
interesting ashtray.
Sorry, Lieutenant.
Captain Harris is out front.
He's looking for you.
- Already?
- Yes.
All right. Hold on.
Let me just, uh... don't
let anyone touch my bag.
Wish me luck.
Good luck, sir.
These guys have been
in business for a while.
Can you hand me a bag, please?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Ooh, check this thing out.
This mobile unit is
specifically designed
to help with chain of custody
for the evidence
we collect on site.
It's all computerized.
We could check for
DNA, fingerprints
without ever needing
to change hands.
- This is...
- It's very detailed, I know.
...expensive.
Look, Jim, I don't know
what I can do about this.
You're going to have
to talk to the commander.
But I did, and he told me
I need to speak with you.
Right.
You really should just talk
to the commander about it.
Yes, sir.
Absolutely, sir.
Oh, fuck!
What the fuck?
Shit!
Get him!
Oh, shit!
- You all right, Bert?
- Fuck no, I'm not all right!
I'm going to have cigarette.
So what was it you needed to
talk me about then, Captain?
You guys down at property
had tagged this little puppy,
and it's going up for
auction this week.
Okay.
I want it as a gift
to my son-in-law.
That's very thoughtful of you.
You know, he's a good kid.
Would you mind heading down
to the OPG and checking it out?
I want our guys in the garage
to know I got my eye on it.
I can look into it
for you, of course.
Great, that's great.
I think we have
everything under control here.
No. I have my...
you can keep that.
I'm sorry, you want me to
go to the garage right now?
I mean, yeah.
What the shit is this?
Is that a lawnmower?
It's for Harris.
For a captain, that
guy's a real shit-heel.
And 5000 dollars
available to bid, to buy.
Who'll give me 5, where?
Who'll give me 2500?
25. Thank you, ma'am.
Now 6 bid.
He wants this thing
for his son?
Son-in-law.
Okay, that's quite the gesture.
Yeah, we'll keep it
off the floor.
Nice car.
What happened here?
That car was dead
when we got it.
Someone gut the engine
completely,
but look what we found
when we popped the hood.
- This is full of cocaine.
- Yeah, I know.
This needs to be submitted
as evidence.
Yes, right, absolutely, sorry.
It will be soon.
Check this out.
Fits like a glove, right?
Quite the clever way
to move coke, if you ask me.
I mean, who checks
the engine block?
Well, I guess I did.
- Who owned the car?
- A local guy.
A drug dealer, obviously.
I got the paperwork for the
arrest on the desk back there,
if want to check it out.
Yes, sir, he's here.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey! The captain wants
to know if you can take
a few new pictures of the
John Deere before you leave.
Just like with your phone
or whatever.
What do you think?
Well, I think
that there's a lot more
to making a cop
than just paper.
Yes, but I just thought
it was unusual.
It is.
You know, a good cop
is gonna look at it
and know exactly what to do.
- Hello?
- Yes, I do.
Was it something I said?
No. I just have to
make a phone call.
Oh!
What the fuck, dude?
What?
You don't see anything unusual?
Where have you brought me?
Look at the guy's sheet.
Why? Why would I...
Look at it.
What do you notice?
- He had a lot of priors.
- And?
- And? What and?
- The girl's coming. Hi!
- This place is a nightmare.
- I'll have a refill and...
Water.
Okay.
She didn't refill me.
She had the pot in her hand.
That's all right, she's probably...
where are you going?
This place is freaking me out.
Just hold on a second, please.
There's something to this.
Would you just sit down?
Humor me for a second.
Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Check out the guy's
bail receipt.
Excuse me! Excuse me!
- This can't be right.
- It is.
- How do you know?
- I checked.
- Was it a bond?
- Cashier's check.
- For 200,000 dollars?
- Uh-huh.
Who paid that?
I don't know.
What do you think?
- What do I think?
- Yes.
I think that guy has
a friend with deep pockets.
That's very deep.
Very deep.
I think that guy's
getting a hand job.
He's still eating,
so it's hard to tell.
Are you gonna have those?
Can I get one?
What?
Who could get that much cash
together that quickly?
What's that for?
- Have you ever tried it?
- Can't say that I have.
All right, you take this one
and I'll take the other.
What, are we in the sixth grade?
I'm not gonna eat this.
That's cash in hand.
I'm just saying that someone
risked a fortune
to get this kid out of jail,
and right now you and I
are the only two people
who even seemed to notice.
So what do you wanna do?
You want me to rob
a drug dealer for you?
Rob a drug dealer?
Um...
right now I just wanna find out
where the cash is coming from.
I don't think it's a good idea.
I'm not talking about
doing anything crazy.
Look, this guy's a...
well, you read his sheet.
He's a nobody.
He can't be nobody. Who spends
200,000 dollars on a nobody?
If you want my opinion,
something like this
is worth doing
if you can keep it quiet
and simple, okay?
What you're talking about here
would be neither of those things.
I can promise you that.
Wow!
That sounded so cool.
The way you just said
that right now?
That sounded cool.
Ugh!
That tastes good to you?
No, it doesn't.
Sometimes I think
I should probably
pull it together a little bit.
I think they're
checking us out.
- No, they're not.
- I think they are.
You're wrong.
I just want to put
a tail on him.
If it's a dead end, so be it.
Life goes on.
None the richer.
And I'll cover your time off.
All right. I'll do it.
I'll find this guy.
But only because when it comes
to you and me, I truly...
and I mean this sincerely...
I truly have nothing
better to do,
and I despise my job.
That's the spirit!
You are a badass!
What the fuck?
♪ Lucky Vegas gambling man... ♪
What does he do in there?
He works in the
first-floor restaurant.
I know, but what is the work?
You know, delivers

He shows up to work

Jimmy, it's your friend.
Where the hell are you
going at this hour?
Official police business, Dad.
Who's the cop?
I am, Dad.
We both are.
- Good night.
- Good luck.
Dad's unusually upbeat tonight.
I know, yeah.
It's good to see.
Yeah, right?
- What the fuck is this?
- It's my tips.
Don't laugh.
It's more than we make.
So they're closed on Sunday.
They do the drop-offs
in the back,
but where does it go
once it's inside?
Did you check it out?
It's funny you should
mention that.
What, you didn't get hired
as a bag boy or something?
Did you take these?
There's one in there
that's, uh...
ah, let's just see
if you can spot it.
- They're terrible.
- Yeah.
It looks like a bum
from the street took these.
Lord knows I wasn't gonna go
marching around back there.
You made a homeless person
take these photos?
Well, I paid him a little.
All right.
Right.
So I think this is more than
just a money drop
- or however you call it.
- Why would you say that?
Because whatever they're
bringing here, stays here.
Nothing goes out.
Ever.
What is this?
Huh?
Look at the freezer, that lock.
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
- Look at you.
- What?
And I'm skipping
right into your little...
My what?
What's that girl that solves the crimes?
Nancy Drew.
This is some Nancy Drew shit.
Oh. You see that one?
Spotted it.
It's a grocery store.
I haven't heard anything from
your department about this.
- What kind of nonsense is this?
- No, no, no...
- You just reached for my phone.
- Yes, I did.
- In a suspicious manner.
- No, I wasn't.
That would suggest you're here under
the auspice of illegal activity.
I promise. This isn't
what you think it is.
I'll call the sheriff.
- I'll give you 100 dollars.
- Okay.
All right.
Well, you are very lucky
that this investigation is so
well funded, I'll tell you that.
Yeah, wipe it. Wipe it.
Okay.
- Uh...
- Right there?
Yeah. Stop there.
Go a few frames back.
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Okay, wait, stop.
Replay that.
Okay, okay, stop.
Can you give me
some other camera angles?
Sure.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Ah, pause it.
Isn't that that sandwich
shop on Decatur,
the one that makes
the cheese steaks?
Oh, yeah, I've been there.
That place is legit.
Man, that place is delicious.
How you doing, Bill?
That's the way to go, man.
The way the cheese
spills over the bread.
You gotta get cheese with it.
Jim.
Give me a hard copy
of that, then wipe it
and just keep going
with the timecodes there.
You got it.
- I looked up the store.
- Yeah?
They recently installed
a new storage unit.
According to the work order,
that freezer has got
36 inches of steel reinforced
concrete protecting it.
Now, it could be the world's
most secure meat locker,
but when you consider the drug
dealers, the hotel front,
and the phony laundry service
making one-way trips
to this place...
And nothing ever goes out.
I think you know
exactly what I'm getting at.
Holy shit.
- Sir?
- Ah, thank you.
- Wipe it?
- Wipe it.
Have you ever broken
into a vault before?
- No. Are you serious right now?
- I don't know.
- Have you?
- No.
- What about this one?
- Yeah, go for it, Louis.
Here's a question.
Someone built a safe in the
back of a grocery store, right?
Yup.
- And we found it.
- Precisely.
And we assume it's filled with
money or drugs or whatever.
- It's filled with stuff.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
Well, how do we,
you know, get it out?
Ja, hallo.
Einen moment.
Einen moment.
Uh...
Ja. Gut. Uh...
Well, my people will contact
you and arrange it. Ja, yes.
I gotta go.
You finish up.
But I'm not authorized.
Who gives a shit?
So this is the floor plan
for the apartment that's
directly above the vault.
Yeah, I taped
it out this morning.
You did a fine job.
What's this?
That's from the guys
in Germany.
This is the quote
for the drill?
You know I don't have
this money.
I'm sure you'll
think of something.
Where am I gonna get
this kind of cash?
You're smart, crafty.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Where's your money coming from?
- I'm refinancing.
- Refinancing what?
It's a home equity loan.
I already applied for it.
You're mortgaging your house
to pay for a heist?
Do you have any idea
how insane that is?
Take me through it.
We don't have a lot of time.
Okay, well, like I was saying,
the ceiling is where
I think we go in.
The vault door isn't that old.
Messing with it runs
the risk of the fail-safes,
unless we want to hire
a professional safecracker...
- Which we don't.
- Which we don't.
So what you're saying
is we drill down
through the floor
of the apartment.
That's right.
And where would we do that?
The dining room.
Let's check it out.
Uh, the only other hitch
is there might be a tenant.
What's that?
Oh, that's nothing.
A bee flew in my face
when I was doing that part.
We'll have to deal with him.
Who, the tenant?
What, do we pay him off?
Pay him off? What? No!
We'll just...
tie him up or whatever.
Tie him up or whatever?
That sounds complicated.
- Which one of us is doing that?
- I'm sure it won't be easy.
You said it like, "Whatever.
We'll just tie him up."
Okay, let's table this for now.
We gotta get back.
So are you good for the money?
'Cause I want
to put the order in.
Jim, it's 10 grand.
Are you good for it or not?
Because I'm all in.
Don't leave me hanging.
This took me three hours,
by the way.
And it's Da Vinci-esque.
All right.
Yeah, I'll figure it out.
You're a positive thinker,
and I respect you.
And I fucking dig you.
Have you ever
done one of these before?
No.
I'm not doing this out of
the goodness of my heart.
You're asking
for a lot of money.
This is a short-term loan.
- I know.
- Let's go.
These guys know the score.
Two might try to run.
If that happens, stop 'em.
All right, everybody up.
Everybody up!
Get up! Up!
Get against the wall right now!
Move!
Get against that wall!
Get against that wall!
Back up!
Just give me a minute.
I'm not ready.
Sir, you are under arrest.
Just give me a minute,
you know.
You have the
right to remain silent.
This is one. I said two.
I said I need two.
- Th-that's all I have.
- I said two!
That's all I have.
That's all I have.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll flip you for it.
No.
No, don't. Don't, no.
Please don't. No, no.
- What do you wanna do?
- Don't, don't, no.
- What do you wanna do?
- No, no, no.
No, no, no, sir! No!
No.
No!
- Go with her. Go!
- No! No!
Bobo?
That's great.
Bobo, Bobo.
Bobo is interesting.
Especially for
someone who sells guns.
I mean, it's fun,
you know? It's...
Bobo, Bobo, Bobo...
I'm Jim, by the way.
Hey, where... where are we...
where are we going? Is it far?
Man, shut the fuck up!
Fuck!
Yo, motherfucker, you can
sit your ass right here
till I know we good.
And if you ain't about that,
I'll stick the pump
to your head right now.
You got me?
So...
it's far.
Get out.
Money.
Whoa.
That's a big one.
It's all there.
You can count it.
I mean, these are
brand new, right?
I mean, uh...
you didn't, uh, like scrape
the serial numbers off them
or anything like that, did you?
Fucking whoever you're after,
I hope he ain't
somebody like me.
Hope he's some corny
motherfucker like you.

Get used to it.
He's our new roommate.
And he's alone in there,
correct?
I've barely seen him
leave the place.
Where'd you stash the van?
The van? No.
I just got the plates.
I thought you were
getting the van.
You were supposed
to take care of both.
Oh, no, I remember
you saying that you...
No, no, I didn't.
The van was yours.
What the fuck
are we gonna do now?
I guess I goofed up.
Sorry, dude.
Jesus.
How are we supposed
to pull this off, huh?
Really.
Look at this thing.
You can't even keep
the simplest...
we're about to risk our lives here!
Do you realize that?
Do you have any clue
how dangerous it is
what we're trying to do,
how many things can go wrong,
or are you just unable
to see that at any point?
I picked it up and I stashed it
by the airport this morning.
I'm sorry, David.
It was just...
just a little
pre-heist joke.
It was just a joke.
Please don't be it.
Please don't be it.
Please don't be it.
Please don't be it.
You good?
You look so cool right now.
Now I'm gonna go in
and show we're clear,
and when I know we're clear,
I'm going to invite you
via walkie-talkie, all right?
Okay.
Ohh! Fuck!
Get up!
Get the fuck up!
Move!
Get on the bed.
Stay quiet.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Keep your hands to yourself.
Christ!
Did you hear anything?
I looked away,
he came after me,
dragged the girl with him.
I only shot the guy.
Put her on the bed.
Set her down here.
- I need to think for a sec.
- Where we gonna put her?
Yeah, okay, get her back up.
Ow! She bit me, man!
Goddamn it!
All right, put her over here.
That looks pretty good.
Maybe.
On three, two, one.
Three.
Okay, you know the drill.
The first bit's spent.
How far are we?
What's up?
They changed the recipe.
No, it has my approval.
We're about halfway through.
I need a cigarette.
Fuck.
I'll take care of this.
- What are you gonna do?
- Something.
Hey, there.
Good evening.
You really gave
us a start, man.
I thought I saw some people
unloading some equipment here.
Well, that's likely.
We got a stakeout going on,
and you nearly walked into it.
A stakeout?
Detective O'Connor.
Oh. Uh, Cliff.
Hey.
So, uh, how long have you
been watching your guy here?
Tonight?
18 hours, I think.
Hey, would you mind
turning your lights off?
You know, I always
wanted to be a cop.
Seemed like a pretty good gig.
- There are perks.
- Yeah, I bet there are.
I'm really gonna need you to
turn those lights off, Cliff.
Oh, yeah, sure thing,
the lights.
I'm gonna need to radio in
the other calls,
let them know
what's going on here.
This is undercover stuff, man.
You really can't.
Sorry.
Oh, yeah, right.
Hey, not a problem, Officer.
- Good luck to you, sir.
- Have a good night, Cliff.
Yeah, you, too.
No!
Must be close.
Gotta move.
We're running behind.
Okay.
Good.
Got a bite.
Keep going.
We must have tripped it.
We didn't trip anything.
The belt.
It's broken.
Do we have any more?
Wh-what's next, Jim?
We'll think of something.
- Are we fucked?
- No.
- Nuh-uh.
- Okay.
We only had
a quarter of an inch left.
All right, grab it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Uh, you want to practice
or something?
I'll hold it if you'd rather.
You haven't had a lot of
coffee today, have you?
JK. Go for it.
Whoo! Just two more.
Give it the goods.
It bounces too much.
We're fucked.
I have an idea.
It's kind of...
wacky.
Jim?
- Did you hear it?
- Oh, fuck!
- We're through.
- Okay.
Ready.
Okay, I've got the tumbler...
and you're right.
I see two fail-safes,
which means if we miss
a number, that's it.
Nothing's gonna get
that door open.
All right.
Let's proceed.
Move slowly to the right
and clear it.
Moving to zero.
Ready.
Okay. Continue.
Catch.
Ready.
Just give me a second.
Okay, continue.
Catch.
Ready.
Slow down.
I can't see the notch.
Stop, stop, stop.
Catch, I think.
You think?
It's behind the other two rings
and I can barely see it,
but I heard something latch.
Did you hear it?
No, I didn't.
It's caught.
Open it.
Are you sure?
Hello?
Yeah. Open it.
Is it open?
Open.
Are we good?
Uh...
What?
What's happening?
Can you hear me?
What is it?
Just steaks down there?
Talk to me.
What are you looking at?
- You should come down here.
- Okay.
Spooky.
Hell is this place?
You open this?
We should go back up and clean.
Okay.
Hello.
Hello!
I have a little boy at home.
He's three.
I need to call his father.
Please.
Please.
That's all I'm asking.
Write the number.
Write it on my hand.
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me.
Hey. You know
what time it is?
Yeah, I know it's early.
- What do you want?
- Can you help me out?
What is it?
- Hi.
- Hey.
Huh.
Jesus fuck.
Do you live here?
Who lives here?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Whose guns are those?
What guns?
The guns in the closet.
I don't know. I don't know
anything about guns.
Whose... you don't know
anything about guns.
Are they his?
I don't know.
I don't know him.
- Whose guns are those?
- I don't know.
Whose guns are those? Huh?
- Whose guns are those?
- What do you want with me?
- Whose guns are those?
- I don't know him!
I don't know him.
We just...
he had coke.
I have...
I have problems, okay?
You have bad luck.
What did she say?
Nothing.
She thinks they're his.
- And who the fuck is he?
- She doesn't know.
These aren't loaded.
You saw that, right?
We can't do this.
What do you mean?
Down there isn't
just a little...
I don't know what this is.
I don't know
where we are right now.
We're in the heart
of the American dream.
I've never seen anything
like this before in my life.
Well, it is a bit of a twist.
- We need to get out of here, man
- Okay.
Everything is staying
right where we found it.
This is crazy right now.
It is a little crazy,
but that doesn't mean
you have to walk away
empty-handed, David.
Empty-handed? We'll be lucky
to walk out of here at all.
You brought enough bags
to take everything.
Jesus.
You knew about this.
What?
You did.
You knew this was here.
Nobody just finds something
like this out of nowhere.
We did.
You had your eye on this.
No, David, I didn't. I'm
just as shocked as you are.
- Well, you don't look it.
- I come prepared.
It's what you do when
you're someone like me
who refuses to underestimate
the power of positive thinking.
You want to know
how positive I am?
I mean, this was going
to be a surprise,
but I can tell
you're a little stressed.
I'm so positive, I've got two
tickets in my pocket right now
for the Bahamas,
one with your name on it,
because when we're finished
here, we're gonna celebrate,
drinking rum
and smoking cigars.
That's how positive I am.
Are you trying
to stick this on me?
- Is that what's going on?
- Stick what on you?
- I'm serious.
- Well, if you're serious,
then you should know
you're not making any sense.
How long have you been waiting for
someone like me to do this with,
a guy you could
point the finger at?
David, I thought you and I...
You know I'd have to be a genius
to plan something like that.
- Then tell me another story, Jim.
- Okay.
We're friends
who found a lot of money,
and I'm super happy about that.
There's your story.
- We're not touching it.
- Oh, my God.
What does it take...
to get someone to split
millions of dollars with you?
Get a grip.
Jim, they'll hunt us down.
David...
please open it.
I asked you nicely.
I'm sorry.
Look, if you're scared,
I get it.
It's okay.
But I'm not.
And I've come this far.
So please open the door.
You'll get us killed, man.
I'm going to ask you
one more time.
Please open it.
I can't.
Open it! Open it!
- Jim.
- Open it! Open it!
Open it! Open it! Open it!
Open it! Open it! Open it!
I think you
should wait with her
while I finish
loading up from the gate.
And then we'll
get rid of her up north.
She saw my face.
What else can we do?
Right.
Hey, Dave, I'm really sorry.
Just one more here.
Okay, you're on solid ground now.
Come on.
All right,
let me put you inside.
Step down.
That's good.
Stay down.
Now this is
what's gonna happen.
If you do exactly
as I say, you'll live.
If you do anything different, you won't.
Understand?
- Jesus! Yes?
- Yes.
It's been a long fucking night.
Once we stop, I'll let you out.
Hopefully you can move on from
this like it never happened.
All right?
8-7-8...
8-7-8-1...
Goddamn it!
Who are they?
Who'd you call?
Jesus.
Oh, God.
Tell me or I'll shoot you
through the fucking seat!
Tell me!
No, no, no, no!
I'm a cop!
No! No!
