Mom, Dad's home!
Dad, are you ready?
Danny!
What's new, kidderoo?
Hi, Janelle.
Client dinner?
Uh, betcha two bucks.
Hey, buddy. Got to run.
Mom and I have a client dinner.
Oh, sorry.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, Danny,
I forgot to tell you.
I have to go with your dad
to a client dinner tonight.
I'm really sorry,
sweetheart.
You guys go out
every night.
When do we get to
practice baseball?
I know it's a lot, Danny.
I'd rather be hanging out with
you, but I've got a job to do.
Hey, you know,
that's okay.
We're going to have
tons of fun.
Aren't we, Danny?
Sure.
Hey, how about tomorrow after
work, you, me, and a baseball?
No excuses!
No excuses!
No excuses!
Deal.
Um, deal.
Hey, thanks for being
such a good kid.
I don't know what we'd do
if you weren't.
Hey, do you want to go up
and play with Iggy?
No. Your iguana
scares the poop out of me.
DAD:
Maybe Janelle
could practice with you.
Oh, that sounds fun.
Not!
Not!

My dad's
a lot better than you,
so is my friend Marco,

Thanks for
the tough love, pal.
Try-outs are coming up.
I want a better position.
Oh, yeah?
What'd you play last year?
Pitcher.
Oh, pitcher's good,
isn't it?
Not in T-ball.
In T-ball,
the pitcher's just standing
in the middle of the diamond,
scratching his butt.
This year is real baseball.
I want to be on first base.

Well, parents

There's only
one solution.
You have to get on

What's the no-sit list?
My cousin
told me about it.
If you're bad enough,
no babysitter will take you.
They'll put you on the list.
Then your parents
will have to stay home.
No way.
Absolutely!

really bad.
High five, dude.
We're gonna win.

Right on the top.

Great throw!
Oh! All right.

Did Grandpa
teach you how to play?
My dad never had a lot of time
to play baseball with me.
Wow, just like me!
Do grownups
hate baseball?
Is that why they have to pay

Buddy, if I could spend all my
time playing baseball with you,

we already are a team.
Really?
Yeah.

Who's that?
He used to work in a prison

that no kid scares him.
He's bad?
The worst babysitter
I ever had.
Forget about TV or games,
you just sit in your room alone.
At dinner time, he slides
a plate under the door.
It's always
a bread sandwich.
One slice of bread
between two other slices.

You're busted.
Your parents are coming.
Run!
They're gonna catch me.
They already know. You might
as well turn yourself in.
Never!
Where's Danny?
I just saw him a second ago.
(Crowd screaming)
You ruined
my son's birthday!
I feel like
all we ever talk about anymore
is why you're being bad
to your babysitters.
You were
such a good boy, Danny.
I know that you're not
this bad in your heart.
I'm concerned, Daniel.
Up until now, you've only
been bad for babysitters,
but you deliberately
disobeyed us.
Sneaking out of the house?
What if something
had happened to you,
and we didn't know
where you were?
BOTH:
Don't you have anything
to say for yourself?
You guys are always going out
to client dinners,
and I'm always stuck here.
When do we get to do something
as a family?
We were gonna
do something tomorrow.
Really? What?
We were gonna go to
a baseball game.
I told my clients
that instead of
going to some
dumb restaurant for dinner,
that we should take our families
out to a baseball game.
That's great, Dad.
We were
gonna do that, Danny,
and then you snuck
out of the house today.
So now you can't go?
No.
Now you can't go.
I've already committed,
so I have to go.
You're going to
a baseball game without me?
I have to.
I can't reward you
for breaking the rules,
and I can't back out
on my client.
Not after leaving them at
the restaurant the other night.
But you can't go.
No one else
will baby-sit for me.
I called around.
There is still someone
who will baby-sit for you.
The first star.
Huh?
"The first star
I see tonight."
JIM:
What do you know.
DANNY:
Can we make a wish,
like we used to?
Of course we can.
ALL:
Star light, star bright,
first star
I've seen tonight,
I wish I may,
I wish I might,
have this wish
I wish tonight.
I wish my son would be the
sweet little boy he used to be.
I wish my parents cared about me
as much as their clients.
I wish
my little boy understood
that everything we do
is for him.
What are you doing?
I didn't want
to get you in trouble
if you're not allowed
to have friends over.
I thought
you weren't talking to me.
I guess we're talking.
I'm really sorry
I ruined your birthday, Marco.
Ruined? That was
the best birthday ever!
I sneezed lava cake
out of my nose.
So you forgive me?
Of course I do.
You're my best friend.
I don't think
my mom does though.
She and my sisters
look like 99 Dalmatians.
(Laughing)
So you wanna come over?
I got the Legend of Zelda,
even though
it's rated "T" for "teen."
I'm grounded forever. My parents
found another babysitter.
No way! Who?
I don't know. But if
he's worse than The Guard,
I'm in big trouble.
MOM:
Danny, are you
talking to someone?
No one's talking to me,
remember?
Hey, Mom,
can I play a game
on your laptop?
It's on the table.
Send me a video chat.
We've gotta make a plan.
So that's it.
You have to
drag this one off quick.
If you can get rid of him
before the game starts,
your dad will have to
come back for you.
And since he can't
back out on his client,
he'll have to
bring me to the game.
Are you positive
this is a good idea, Danny?
Why not?
Well, your babysitters just
keep getting worse and worse.
And now I can't even
play with you anymore.
Being bad
hasn't worked so well.
And being good
didn't work at all.
So, what are you gonna do?
Well, all I know is,
if this one's worse
than The Guard,
I'm in big trouble.
(Doorbell ringing)
You can't do it, Danny.
But you have to be
the worst kid to baby-sit ever.
And I have to do it quick.
Once the game starts,
it's too late.
This is for my family.
I'm going to be
the worst kid ever.
I'm going to be
the worst kid ever.
I'm going to be
the worst kid ever.
Hey, kidderoo.
What's new?
(Whispering)
Worst kid ever.
For my family.
♪
So where have you been?
Um, studying for the SATs.
it's this test you have to take
to get into college.
Oh.
Which is totally stupid
because
I want to study art,
so who cares how good I am
at math anyway, right?
Um, I guess so.
I thought you didn't want
to baby-sit for me anymore.
I will always
sit for you, Danny.
You're my favourite.
But didn't you hear
what I did
to the other sitters?
Ah, I don't listen
to gossip.
I know you, Danny. And you just
don't have it in you to be mean.
What time is it?
Almost noon?
The game starts in an hour.
How long does it take
to get there?
See? You're always thinking
of other people.
But don't worry, your parents
have plenty of time.
But I don't.
What?
You're wrong.
I can be bad if I want to.
Sure, Danny.
You're a horrible
baseball player.
Yeah, no kidding.
Right?
I hope you fail
for your SAP test
'cause then
you won't go to college,
and then you'll get fat and old
and sleep under a bridge.
(Laughing)
That's a nice try. But I told
you, you couldn't be mean.
(Phone ringing)
Hey, Marco.
You're still alive!
Who's babysitting?
Someone worse
than The Guard?
Much worse.
Who?
It's Janelle.
How is that worse
than The Guard?
I can't be mean to her.
You have to try.
She just thinks
I'm kidding.
What am I going to do?
You want to
see your family, right?
Yeah.
Well, then you have to
get rid of her.
But I like her.
Yeah, that's good.
Yeah, because
she's going to be
coming to your house
every day.
I thought you just told me
not to be bad today.
That's crazy.
If you're gonna give up now,
then what's the point
of getting on the list?
Now I'm confused.
Well,
you better decide soon,
'cause you have half an hour
to get rid of her,
or your dad
will already be at the game.
So, what you gonna do,
Danny?

That's work to him.
Danny, your dad

My dad hardly spends
any time with me at all.
How come
they don't wanna be with me?
I'm sure they do, Danny.
They love you.
It's just,
sometimes adults do things
that are impossible
to explain to kids.
Like Algebra.
What's Algebra?
Exactly.
So you're not
going to call?
Sorry, Charlie.
Now, what do you say
you let me out of here,

Sorry, Charlie.

Hi, Mr. Parker.
Danny wanted me to call.
Is everything okay?
Well...
Yeah, I'm still here. I think
Danny wants to talk to you.
Hi, Dad.
Hey, Danny.
What's going on, buddy?
Hi, Dad.
Are you doing Algebra?
Algebra?
Why do you ask about that?
I think it's something
that grownups do
that they can't
explain to kids, right?
I suppose so.
When you're gone
all the time,
is that for something that
grownups can't explain to kids?
That's exactly what it is.
Is something wrong?
I'm just really sorry
I've been acting bad, Dad.
It's just something that kids
can't explain to grownups.
Kind of like Pokémon.

Makes sense to me.
I don't like being bad.
I know you don't, Danny.
I just miss
spending time with you.
