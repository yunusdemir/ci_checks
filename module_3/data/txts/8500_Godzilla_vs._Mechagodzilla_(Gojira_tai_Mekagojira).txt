At last we have it now.
A robot to kill Godzilla.
<i>The year is 1992 A.D.</i>
<i>In order to counter the threat posed</i>
<i>to the planet's survival by Godzilla...</i>
<i>... Japan's Counter G Bureau...</i>
<i>... recruited the world's most brilliant</i>
<i>scientific brains...</i>
<i>... to build a fighting machine.</i>
<i>The first machine</i>
<i>was called "Garuda."</i>
<i>But its fighting</i>
<i>capabilities were limited.</i>
<i>A far more powerful</i>
<i>machine was required.</i>
<i>They salvaged a robot from</i>
<i>the future, Mecha King Ghidorah...</i>
<i>... in order to study</i>
<i>its advanced technology.</i>
<i>Its components were used</i>
<i>to build a weapon to fight Godzilla.</i>
<i>They called it "Mechagodzilla."</i>
Its main engine is a reactor.
It uses a derivative of heavy
hydrogen helium three in pellet form.
The armour is heatproof alloy,
code-named NT-1.
And what about the protective shield?
Synthetic diamond,
it's totally heat repellent.
It reflects the heat back to the source.
That's incredible.
I really believe this machine
is the weapon to defeat Godzilla.
Oh, shit.
Hi, I'd like you to meet Yuri Katagiri.
Oh, hi there. I'm Kazuma Aoki.
So this is Robot One?
Yeah.
It's the ultimate in modern technology,
otherwise known as Garuda.
Was the ultimate, now it's just junk.
Kazu here was on the team
that built this machine here.
Of course he thinks...
So where do you work?
This section.
You do, do you?
Well, then, welcome aboard.
Not quite.
You've just been transferred.
- What?
- Look.
"Mr. Kazuma Aoki is to report
immediately to G-force."
G-force?
Single with no children.
- Hobbies, pteranodons?
- Right, sir.
Don't you know what they are, sir?
They're small flying dinosaurs.
Enough. You have been
transferred over here...
...to take part in the Robot Two
project together with three ace pilots.
But I'm beginning
to have my doubts.
I'm wondering if there hasn't
been some kind of mistake.
Flying dinosaurs!
I don't know
where you think you are.
This isn't a summer camp
for dinosaur freaks.
It's a training centre.
Do you understand?!
Yes, sir.
Come in.
Sonezaki reporting for duty, sir.
Take him and drill him.
Ready.
Start.
Goddamn it, I've lost
all power in sector two.
We were up here with the Russians
doing a geological survey...
...for their national petroleum guys.
- Yeah.
- We came across something strange.
We're nearly there.
Professor, is this really a pteranodon?
- Yes, I'm certain.
- That's not all, we found an egg.
An egg?
That's incredible.
I just can't believe it.
A pteranodon egg. And it would
seem to be perfectly intact.
Look at it, it's enormous.
Professor, what do you
think this could be?
Azusa, come here. Take a look at this.
- It's a plant substance.
- Could it be some kind of fern?
Professor, look at the egg.
Look!
What the hell is that?
- Rodan.
- Rodan?
It's a giant pteranodon.
You... You think it's from
that other egg?
I'm certain.
It's been irradiated.
That's why it's so enormous.
The same thing happened to Godzilla.
You know, this whole island
is a junkyard of nuclear waste.
Godzilla!
Back to the helicopter.
<i>The giant pteranodon egg</i>
<i>found on Adonoa Island...</i>
<i>... has been taken to Kyoto. It will be</i>
<i>examined by Professor Omae...</i>
<i>... of the National Institute</i>
<i>of Biotechnics.</i>
<i>Right now, the question being</i>
<i>asked is, "Will the egg hatch?"</i>
Wow, that's incredible.
A 65-million-year-old egg
right here. Amazing.
- What are you doing?
- Oh, hello there.
My name is... Sorry.
Who are you?
- Do you work here?
- No.
I'm a pteranodon enthusiast.
Excuse me.
Hey, wait. You can't
come in here. It's off-limits.
Oh, that's okay, don't worry.
This is really most interesting.
- You can't stay here.
- Tell me.
You think it'll hatch?
That would be a gas.
Just imagine it.
- Tell me, what are these?
- Don't touch them.
Yes.
Yes, I'll be right there.
All right, professor.
- Please get out.
- Maybe I'll say hello to the professor.
Out of the question.
Right.
Okay.
But this was meant to happen.
- What?
- What I mean to say is...
...who knows what it might
lead to, you and me...
If you continue, you're gonna
get a slap in the face.
I didn't mean to...
I want a constant surveillance
on the egg day and night.
- Yes, sir.
- Keep up time-lapse photography...
...one frame per hour. The
colour seems to be changing.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I guess it
must have dropped into my pocket.
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
I don't believe
a word you're telling me!
If you ask me, you stole it from here.
Bring it back right now or else.
So I'm a thief now, huh?
Azusa, wanna hear my theory
about our egg here?
Sure.
The egg's colour indicates how
it's feeling at the time, I think.
When we took it from its nest
on the island, it turned red.
Because it was afraid.
It turns red whenever
it's afraid or distressed.
- I see.
- Azusa...
...I checked your
duty hours for last week.
I found that whenever you were away,
the egg turned bright red.
Otherwise, it stayed a normal colour.
- Look here.
- But why would it do that?
It's listening...
...to outside sounds,
in hopes that maybe...
...it'll recognise its
mother's voice somewhere.
That's my theory anyway.
But instead of her...
Azusa, it heard you.
Hey, what's this?
It's a prehistoric plant.
Pretty old.
Yes, I can feel it.
- Hello, Miki.
- Hello.
- How are you, Miki?
- Fine.
- Nice to see you. Are you well?
- Fine.
Well, I never! This is a surprise.
- Hello, sir. It's lovely to see you again.
- You too.
- And who's this?
- Aoki, G-force, sir.
G-force, did you say?
I don't trust you guys one little bit.
Please, sir, we need
your assistance.
Can you take a look?
It emits something strange
but very weak.
We can't seem to measure it.
Maybe they could find what it is.
- Music?
- That's right, listen.
The children felt it
when they concentrated.
Then fed it into the computer.
Yes? What? What's that?
What we've got is no pteranodon.
This baby is something else.
- It's a Godzillasaur.
- What's a Godzillasaur?
It's in the Godzilla family, but
this species is not as aggressive.
Really? You sure?
- Well, he looks inoffensive.
- He's kind of cute, isn't he?
Well, one thing's certain,
this is no Godzilla.
What we have here
is a plant-eating Godzillasaur.
Yeah.
I wonder... Maybe the egg
was a parasite egg.
- What?
- Professor...
...what's a parasite egg?
Well, it's like some birds.
They lay their eggs in
the nests of other birds.
For example, the European cuckoo.
What?
Godzilla.
Yes?
What's that? Godzilla's
attacking the city?
- Where's Kazuma?
- I don't know.
What? Where the hell
is that jackass?
Chase, get me a backup pilot.
All systems green.
You see, Mechagodzilla is stronger.
See, it can return your heat beam.
We've got you, Godzilla.
What's that?!
The power discharge.
It's flowing backwards, sir.
Get after him!
Things aren't looking good, I'm afraid.
It'll take weeks to fix Mechagodzilla.
Damn!
I hope we're not too late.
Son of a bitch!
What's going on?
Where's he heading?
Due west, sir.
Kyoto?
He must be stopped,
whatever the cost.
He's through our defences.
So, what will we do?
It appears to be destroying
everything in its path.
It's unstoppable.
There are explosions
and massive fires all over the city.
Someone has to do something,
or Kyoto will be destroyed.
Now it looks like it's heading
for the Kyoto tower.
<i>Evacuate the building.</i>
<i>Evacuate the building.</i>
Get out! Godzilla's coming!
Professor, do you think
the baby called it?
Do you have a sealed room here?
Maybe we can isolate the baby.
If we can stop it calling,
there's a chance that we...
We can stop Godzilla.
Azusa, we could try
the underground cell store.
I think that Godzilla went
to the island for a reason.
I think it went there
to collect the Godzillasaur egg.
Godzilla's up there.
He's above us!
Don't be afraid.
He's gone away.
Well, I...
You see, sir, I just...
...used up a few days' vacation
I had coming to me, sir.
Well, next time,
ask my permission first...
...before you go taking vacations.
I mean it.
Do you understand?
Well, let's just forget it this time.
Catch.
"Starting June 29, Officer Kazuma
will be in charge of the parking lot."
That's what it says, Kazuma.
Now get out. Goodbye.
Come in.
Excuse me, sir.
What, you mean, you...?
Baby.
You can't still be hungry.
You've only just eaten.
Well, just a little bit, then.
Here.
It's really perfect. He'll love it here.
We'll raise it here,
but we'll need your assistance.
We'll all be counting on you, miss,
I hope you realise.
Don't worry, sir.
Take good care of it.
As you well know,
it's a very important animal.
<i>Welding team to sector three.</i>
And also,
check that transducer coupling.
Professor Omae of the National
Institute of Biotechnics...
...has come up with
a startling discovery.
It would seem that the Godzillasaur
in captivity...
...has a second brain located
in its body.
Right here.
So therefore the same
must be true with Godzilla.
- Correct.
- Go on, sir.
We'll change Mechagodzilla's
attack plan, to attack this weak point.
Next time, we'll attack from behind
and aim for his second brain.
This new attack plan
has been given a code name:
G-crusher.
It'll paralyze Godzilla completely.
Without that brain,
he won't be able to stand up.
Baby, what are you doing?
Come here immediately.
Hey, babe.
What is that?
This is my new limousine.
And you can cut out
the "babe" business.
I'm sorry. What's that?
He's been playing up.
Baby, you be good, okay?
You got promoted?
Yes, I did. I'm back flying again.
I'm really glad.
What's that?
This is my new robot.
It's called a pteranodon.
And, yes, it can fly.
- Can it really?
- Why not come for a ride?
Take this. I think it should fit.
Hold on to me.
Baby!
You know, I pity your future husband.
He's gonna be a real handful.
Just think. You'll need at least a
mansion to house your dinosaur.
Right, here we go.
Oh, my God.
This way, girls.
Can I help you?
The girls wanted to come
and see Baby.
- Are they all from the ESP school?
- Yes.
- Hello, miss.
- Hello there.
Isn't he lovely?
- He's still only little, though.
- Yeah, he is so little.
The girls have learned
to sing a song for him.
- Really?
- Girls, sing for Baby.
Yes, please. Go on.
All right.
- Baby!
- What's up?
- What?
- Baby!
Baby, what's the matter?
No, Baby.
- I don't understand.
- What's the matter with him?
What's wrong?
Yes, that must be it.
It must be the song.
The song?
You remember.
The last time we heard the music,
the baby started to hatch out.
Whenever he hears
the plant's music...
...Baby somehow gets
a huge intake of power.
The aim of the plan is to somehow
try to lure Godzilla away.
The destination:
The Ogasawara Islands.
They're remote and uninhabited.
And the only way to lure Godzilla
is with a decoy.
And what will you use?
We've no alternative.
The Godzillasaur.
Baby's life can't be put at risk.
Don't worry,
you'll be looking after him.
I've decided that for this mission,
you'll be on board the Mechagodzilla.
- But what for?
- Because, my dear...
...I need you to find the exact location
of that second brain.
Believe me...
...it's very important.
I beg you, stop this operation.
I understand your concern, miss.
This dinosaur is an important asset.
It would be foolish to waste it.
Baby's not an asset, he's just an
intelligent being with a right to live.
Baby's not a commodity
or a disposable asset.
Wait a moment.
The men of G-force
have a responsibility.
They must rid the world
of the threat posed by Godzilla.
That's why they've got
to go ahead with this plan.
I'm sorry if you can't accept that.
You know, I did think...
...that fighting Godzilla was doing
something worthwhile for humankind.
But now I guess
I've just changed my mind.
Baby did that for you, I think.
I feel sorry for Baby.
I guess he was born
65 million years too late.
Maybe.
Or else too early.
Why too early?
Well, dinosaurs were around
for 150 million years...
...and man has only been around
for 2 million years.
Who knows, one day
dinosaurs could make a comeback.
Look, it's frightened.
Baby.
Baby.
Sorry, miss,
you'll have to come down.
I'll stay here.
- Please close the door.
- You sure?
Baby needs somebody.
There, there.
Everything will be all right.
All right, close it up.
Baby.
Don't be afraid.
I'll look after you. It's all right now.
<i>This is Lizard One, course 167.</i>
<i>Roger, Lizard One.</i>
What time is the attack
scheduled to begin?
In 30 minutes, at 1700.
A report from Chitose Base, sir.
A giant bird was sighted above Amori
10 minutes ago.
A giant bird? Like what?
We have visual contact.
What the hell?
It's Rodan.
- Rodan?
- Rodan's alive. Look!
The giant bird is now heading west.
Sendai's had a sighting.
- It's now turned south, sir.
- Where's it going?
Maybe...
Listen, the baby's eyes
were glowing red.
It could've been an SOS.
Baby is, after all,
Rodan's half-brother.
They're communicating.
Contact Lizard One immediately.
<i>Roger, returning to base, over.</i>
Lizard One, come in.
Goddamn it!
Kazuma, the container's
gone missing.
<i>It's me, sir.</i>
- Who's me?
- Aoki, sir.
<i>I'm sorry, sir, I had to do it.</i>
Garuda was my idea, sir.
Sir, Rodan's landed!
Hurry! Rodan's landed.
He's breaking open the container.
Oh, no!
There they are.
- That's a heat beam.
- Same as Godzilla's.
- Plasma grenades?
- Wait. Aoki!
We're gonna use plasma.
You distract Rodan.
Get him clear of that box!
Roger.
Damn that Rodan!
Azusa!
- Where are you?
- Hurry! Come on!
- Quick!
- Azusa, are you okay?
Yes, sir. We're both all right.
Baby's fine too.
Get down, professor. We'll open it.
Cut it open.
Godzilla's here at last.
The energy pool's overheated, sir.
We can't run it.
Shit!
Aoki, you still there?
Damn!
<i>Hurry! Godzilla's here. Aoki!</i>
Godzilla?
All right!
You got here just in time.
I was getting worried.
Well, where were you?
Off on another vacation?
Let's see if you can get that tin can
upright. Let's go.
<i>Roger.</i>
Super Mechagodzilla, ready to go.
Do exactly as you were told.
Do you hear?
Do it. You have to.
We got Godzilla.
At long last we've won.
We've done it, commander.
Sorry, sir. Roger and out.
<i>Aoki, where are you going?</i>
Azusa, it's me.
Are you all right? Azusa!
Yes, we're all right.
All right, finish it.
Baby.
Rodan is still alive.
What's that power?
That is Rodan's energy.
Godzilla's brain has reconstituted.
- What's that?
- It's Rodan's energy.
- It revived the brain.
- My God.
That isn't possible.
Incredible.
The armour's going, sir.
Hold on to your helmets.
We're not beaten yet.
You're wrong.
There are plenty of us.
Azusa, Kazuma, hurry.
Baby...
...you must leave.
You must go back with the others.
It's the only way.
Can't you see that?
Baby...
...I can't look after you
anymore. See?
I'm so sorry.
Baby.
Baby.
I can't stay.
You have to understand.
And thank you, Baby.
Take care, now.
<i>Miki, this is Azusa.</i>
<i>Do you read me? Over.</i>
Please, Miki.
Try to make Godzilla understand.
Try using your telepathy...
...that he must take Baby away.
He doesn't belong here.
Do you think you'll be able
to do that, Miki?
Yes, I'll try.
There's proof for all
that life always conquers.
Life, sir?
Reptiles or humankind,
we all fight to protect our offspring.
Take care, now, Baby.
You as well...
...Godzilla.
Will there be a dinosaur age...
...long after man's presence
here has been forgotten?
It will come, I'm sure.
It may not be for another
few million years.
I also know...
...they'll be waiting for it.
