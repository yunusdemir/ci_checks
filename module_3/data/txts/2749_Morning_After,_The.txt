<i>Good morning, it's Eye On L.A.</i>
<i>Photography, modeling and pumping iron.</i>
<i>Are they combining into
a new kind of soft porn?</i>
<i>This morning, Eye On L.A.
looks into this phenomenon.</i>
<i>There are those legitimate
photographers, like Harry Langdon...</i>
<i>...and then there are those
photographers right on the edge.</i>
<i>We'll be talking to the controversial
Bobby Korshack...</i>
<i>...who's had his legal difficulties
in the past...</i>
<i>...run-ins with the local authorities
over films he called art...</i>
<i>...and others called obscene.</i>
<i>Korshack's magazines have hurt
legitimate publications.</i>
<i>In fact, some have been removed
from supermarket checkout counters...</i>
<i>...because of their covers. Is he, as he
says, "glorifying the new female form...</i>
<i>...just like Ziegfeld"?</i>
<i>Or is he still, as he's been called
by his detractors, the king of sleaze?</i>
<i>We'll be hearing from the models,
the agents, the publishers.</i>
<i>But first, let's meet the
always-controversial Bobby Korshack.</i>
<i>Okay, Mr. Korshack, you're considered
by some as the king of porn.</i>
<i>How long have you been doing this?</i>
<i>I've been...</i>
<i>I've been into it
for about three years.</i>
<i>- Has it been profitable so far?
- I always do well.</i>
<i>I see.</i>
<i>Mr. Korshack, this fashion
of female muscle-building...</i>
<i>...how prevalent do you think
it's going to become?</i>
<i>I think it's- I think it's the new wave.
I think it's an era that-</i>
<i>It's worldwide. It's really important.
It deals with health.</i>
<i>I've been told that you and other men
find these muscle women...</i>
What the fuck?
<i>What do you think
they look like in clothes?</i>
<i>Ordinary. Detestable.</i>
<i>Mr. Korshack, you knew we'd be
getting around to this eventually.</i>
<i>It's no secret you've had problems
in the past with...</i>
<i>...shall we say, well, some very
sexually explicit photographic work.</i>
<i>- Do you regret any of that now?
- No, I see growth. I actually do.</i>
<i>It's...</i>
<i>We all come from somewhere.
I've tried different avenues.</i>
<i>I'm not ashamed of what I've done,
and I'm proud of what I am doing now.</i>
<i>To expand on that a little bit...</i>
<i>...I've tried different avenues,
from acting...</i>
Wait a minute.
<i>...working in some of the films of
friends- None of this stuff is released.</i>
<i>But...</i>
<i>- ... it brings me to this point now...
- Hey!</i>
<i>...where I'm doing very well.</i>
What are you trying to pull?
<i>In your opinion, Mr. Korshack...</i>
<i>...do you feel film or still photography
represent a woman at her sexiest?</i>
Is that one of those trick-?
Great.
God.
<i>Only a story...</i>
<i>You were an actor for some time.</i>
<i>Did your acting experience
help you as a photographer?</i>
<i>Oh, very much, very much.</i>
<i>Really, still photography is like acting,
just in short moments.</i>
<i>My ability as a photographer
in bringing something out...</i>
<i>...to bring that moment out
in these people...</i>
<i>...to be sensitive to them and to
understand really helps a great deal.</i>
<i>I've been on both sides of the camera.</i>
<i>- Are the models sensitive?
- Very sensitive.</i>
<i>You gotta be very careful and treat them
as human beings and not objects.</i>
<i>As an actor I understand that.</i>
<i>I've been able to work with them
and get the best out of them.</i>
<i>They've got a lot to offer.</i>
<i>Mr. Korshack, do you think these girls
will be replacing...</i>
<i>...what was thought of in the past
as the conventional type?</i>
<i>Well, I think these women
are all beautiful.</i>
Congratulations.
<i>It's 9:30, and I'm on my way,
but I'll be at-</i>
Can it wait?
- I'm doing this slalom over the canyon.
- I gotta talk to you.
<i>- Jacky!
- Right here.</i>
- What happened last night?
- Christ, you start early.
- What are you boozing for at 10 a. m.?
- Breakfast of champions.
Jacky, please, come on.
What happened?
<i>- You fucked up again.
- What do you mean? How?</i>
<i>- I don't remember a damn thing.
- You're really something, girl.</i>
<i>- You draw a blank whenever you-
- What did I do?!</i>
Do?
All right. I talked to a client of mine.
A woman could offer you the first
reasonable gig you've had in years.
I tell her how talented and beautifuI,
et cetera, et cetera.
<i>She goes all the way
to Martineau's to find you.</i>
She calls me later to tell me
that she did like your style...
<i>...or whatever's left of it,
and you know what you do?</i>
Why don't I remember any of this?
You're kidding me.
You know what you did?
You called her a dyke!
"A greasy, diesel dyke," to be exact.
- Why would I say that?
- Because she is one.
But you have to say it?
Listen, Jacky...
I just woke up with a dead guy.
You got more serious problems
than lousy lovers, believe me.
No.
I mean, dead, Jacky.
This man is cold.
You're kidding me.
<i>- I'm looking at him.
- He had a heart attack?</i>
Yeah, from a knife in his chest.
And there's- There's blood all over.
Christ, Alex.
Should I call the-?
Should I call the cops?
- I think you better.
- I'm scared.
You know what I mean, Jacky.
The cops?
No, it's bad if you run.
I don't even know where I am.
<i>You better call the cops. And a lawyer.</i>
It'll be all right, babe.
You wanna bet?
Wait! Taxi!
Taxi!
1560 Sweetzer.
- What time is it?
- Ten-fifteen.
Friday?
Thursday. November 28th, 1986.
Do me a favor, will you?
Stop by my bank. It's on the way.
It won't do you any good.
- Turkey. Pilgrims. Indians and all that.
- Shit.
That bank inquiry isn't your sweet way
to beat me out of my fare, is it?
Fairfax and Santa Monica.
- Hey, Harry.
- Viveca.
You were on again last night,
channel 13.
With Richard Egan.
You sure were something, Viv.
Hey, I missed the bank.
Could you cash a check?
- Sure, Viv.
- Could you stand 200?
<i>Thank you for calling AirCal.</i>
<i>Due to Thanksgiving traffic,
all our reservations-</i>
Hey, Red, thanks for opening up.
- Viveca phone?
- Nope. Just those.
You can take off now. I just got
a couple of heads to do for parties.
Make sure I got a line upstairs,
will you?
- Miss Harding say what it was about?
- Nope.
Probably the party.
They give one every Thanksgiving.
I know. I see pictures of it
in the Friday papers.
- Lucky.
- Who?
You. It's Bel Air, you go out,
you do her hair...
- ... and then you get to stay, right?
- For a while.
Thanks for coming in, Red.
<i>Flight 795 DC-9-</i>
Hi. When's your next flight
to San Francisco?
On the half-hour, but it's booked.
- Well, I'll take the next one.
- That one's booked too.
- How about later this afternoon?
- We're booked all day. It's a real mess.
How about, what do you call it,
stand-in?
Standby. You can try. Gate 2B,
but they're like animals.
- What is it?
- Oh, God.
My husband just called.
I've been stuck in traffic for two hours.
To tell me that she's dying.
Her condition was stable when I left San
Francisco, and now, all of a sudden...
- ... with no warning-
- She? Whose condition?
My daughter.
Acute angina pectoris.
- Seventeen years old.
- Oh, my God.
- Please, can't you get me on a flight?
- Honey, let me get my supervisor.
- You wait over there.
- Oh, thank you.
Madam, I've been told of your situation.
And we'll do everything possible,
of course...
<i>...but there's no procedure
whereby we can arbitrarily displace...</i>
...passengers already holding tickets on
our San Francisco flight 119 in order to-
How about Vegas?
- What?
- Do you fly to Vegas?
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, you guys.
- How in the hell can you do-?
- I called the Auto Club.
It just went dead on me.
I'm sorry.
Let me give it another try.
I think it's just the electrical system.
Let me try it again.
Oh, my God, what do you know.
It must've just needed a rest.
- Your taillights don't work, lady.
- Hey, are you insured?
I doubt it. Why don't you
stay here while I go get the police.
Hey, don't I know you from someplace?
You look familiar to me.
God!
This may take a little while.
That's okay.
You wanna try the starter?
Where is it?
It's hanging below the dash.
Two little wires.
All right, now give it gas.
No, give it gas!
Okay, okay, okay.
Oh, God.
This isn't a pickup, is it?
Okay, I was just checking.
You going into L.A.?
I'm Turner Kendall.
Viveca-
- Do you watch much TV?
- No, not much.
I've got a loose heel.
Spade in a Caddy.
Ran into somebody.
"Spade in a caddy"?
Is that anything like jack-in-the-box?
I wish I had the Caddy dealership
in Watts.
Spades...
...they spend disproportionately
on their transportation.
Also in dressing their young.
What are you,
the Klan anthropologist?
You can tell a lot about people
from the cars that they drive.
You sure can.
This is an investment.
An investment?
Sure. I fix it up a little bit,
your beaners...
<i>...they'll fight with machetes
for a car like this.</i>
My "beaners"?
Yes, it's the tailfins.
Anything late '50s, GM or chrysler.
You don't say "beaners"?
No.
On your best behavior, huh?
Third and Garland.
- That's where I'm going.
- Oh, okay.
But I'll be glad to take you wherever
you're going.
Just drop me where I can get a cab.
- Whatever makes you happy.
- A cab! A cab would make me happy.
Look, it wouldn't be out of my way
to take you where you're going.
How do you know?
How do you know where I'm going?
No place would be that far
out of my way.
Find yourself with a lot of free time
on your hands, Turner?
Oh, just the Klan meeting this week.
That's all I got.
- You need water?
- No.
You're experienced, huh?
Some things.
- What were you doing at the airport?
- Me?
Seeing my daughter off.
Spent a couple of days with me.
I put her on a 12:30 flight...
<i>...so she'd get to her mother
by turkey time.</i>
- Twelve-thirty?
- Yeah, I hung around, I guess.
I used to like to watch the takeoffs
and landings. Now, modern airports...
<i>...you can't see the planes,
just like the bus depot.</i>
- I haven't heard that in years.
- What?
"Bus depot. "
Well, it was a holiday.
Maybe you like watching
all those people say goodbye.
Yeah, maybe.
They say hello too, you know.
This'll be fine right here.
Here? You sure?
Yeah, my friend lives
right around the corner.
Whatever makes you happy.
What if he's not home?
He's home.
He's sick.
Thanks again for the lift.
Oh, it's stuck. You gotta pull back
and shove at the same time.
- Give one to the Grand Dragon for me.
- Oh, you got me all wrong, lady.
- Really?
- Well, that's okay.
I probably got you wrong too.
Hello!
Listen...
...if I did that to you...
<i>...I didn't mean it, I swear to God.</i>
I'm not a bad person.
<i>I'll just tidy up, and you...</i>
...keep on doing
whatever you were doing.
But if I did do it...
<i>...you must've gotten me crazy.</i>
You call me a lush?
Something crazy like that?
I'll get the windows next time.
Kitty?
Here, kitty.
How did you get into a closed-?
- How is he?
- Who?
Your sick friend.
He's better.
- You're a lady with a lot on her mind.
- What do you mean?
Don't you wonder how I found you?
It must've dropped out of your purse.
It had your friend's address
on this matchbook.
- You do his laundry for him?
- All the time.
You don't look so domesticated to me.
Well, I'm not. I'm just a good friend.
- It must be nice having a good friend.
- You lonely, sailor?
No, but I don't have anybody
doing my laundry.
Poor thing. Where you from?
- Bakersfield.
- No wonder.
And you're L.A.
by way of the Big Apple.
Right.
- Thanks.
- Anytime.
I'll take it.
That's okay. I'll take it
to the door for you.
What do you do for work, Turner?
I'm a cop.
Ex-cop, really. Disabled.
Don't look disabled to me.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Good night.
I'd ask you in, but it's too ethnic.
- The neighborhood.
- Oh, I know. It's Jewish.
- Very stable real estate. Low turnover.
- Exactly.
Helps them to keep
certain traditional values.
Very heavy emphasis
on educational achievement.
- In the arts, hey, these people-
- Please.
But, you know, that kind of isolation,
that does breed prejudice.
Turner.
Look, I have a little disappearing act.
I count to three, and you disappear.
One, thanks for helping me today.
- You're welcome.
- Two...
...you really saved my life.
Anytime.
Three...
...goodbye.
Sure.
It didn't work.
Sometimes it doesn't.
You know, when I'm tired.
What the hell, come on in.
I got a couple of tacos
in the freezer.
Whatever makes you happy.
That's what you've got, all right.
Two tacos.
Have I ever lied to you?
That's very weird.
- What's weird?
- Two tacos, a jar of olives...
...and six and a half jars of mayonnaise.
Well, I always think I'm running out.
And...
...possibly lettuce, or is that a lime?
I don't cook.
And four gallons of Thunderbird.
It was on special.
All your...
Your credit cards are all expired.
I noticed, in your wallet.
But there's millionaires wish they had
as much mayonnaise as you've got.
Any plans for tonight?
Yeah, I'm gonna take a shower.
Air conditioner's been busted
for a month.
Well, take your shower,
and I'll be right back.
What for?
It looks like you could use
some real food.
Give me your keys...
...to get back in.
Oh, God.
The only...
...turkey that they had
was sandwiches.
That's fine.
And cranberries.
Well, you gotta-
You gotta have cranberries.
<i>Oh, it's a trifle fruity...</i>
...lacks depth...
<i>...but for the bucks, you can't beat it.</i>
Hey, you married, Turner?
Well, who'd marry a guy
with a '56 chevy?
It's an investment.
How'd you get disabled?
Oh, it was an- An incident.
Really let it all hang out, don't you?
Okay, I got stabbed...
...by a little hooker, 14 years of age.
A little spic hooker, was she?
See. Now, I didn't say anything
about "spic. "
What stopped you?
She happened to be
of Scotch-Irish extraction...
<i>...but you're right, most of them
are Chicano.</i>
- I didn't invite them in.
- You wouldn't.
Hey, come on. It's Thanksgiving.
Well, I'll drink to that.
<i>Anyway, she must've...
Must've cut some nerves up here.</i>
can't draw my weapon right anymore.
Feels awkward.
Maybe you just got tired of being a cop.
You kidding?
That was the best job I ever had.
Oh, hassling drunks and hookers?
Speed traps?
- Must've been a great life.
- Yeah, I did investigation work.
I might have made detective.
- Was it in L.A.?
- In Bakersfield.
Seven years.
That's where you studied bigotry.
You're bad.
How can I be a bigot?
I mean...
<i>...they're all...</i>
...full of ill will and malice.
I just...
...make observations.
Like "spade," "beaner" and "spic"?
That sounds like a law firm, doesn't it?
"Spade, Beaner and Spic,
good morning. "
You got a twisted view of the world,
you know that, Turner?
coming from who? A broad who's got
100 gallons of cheap wine...
- ... and two frozen tacos in her icebox?
- Don't forget the mayonnaise.
Actually...
<i>...I'm rather surprised that I don't look
familiar to you, Turner.</i>
Obviously, you don't watch
the better TV channels.
- What?
- I am an actress.
Was.
I was even good.
They were grooming me
to be the new Vera Miles.
The new who?
Exactly.
Exactly.
I was supposed to replace somebody the
audience didn't even know was missing.
- I gotta call Jacky.
- Call who?
Oh, God, Turner.
Don't you know anybody?
I mean, what do you do all day?
- I do plenty.
- Well, name one.
I like to repair stuff.
Stuff. What stuff?
Whatever needs it.
Whatever people are through with.
Were you really any good?
<i>I could've...</i>
I could've been a contender.
Hey, I think I did see you
in a movie once.
Thanks.
Who's that?
Hold the fort.
<i>- Hello?
- Alex?</i>
Jacky.
I'm gonna take this in the bedroom.
Would you hang up the phone, Turner?
Hi, Jacky.
It's me again.
Who's drunk?
Oh, come on, baby, aren't we pals?
What? Oh, yeah, that.
Just slipped my mind.
Oh, don't get mad.
Nothing. I've just got
some laundry to do.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I'll do it tomorrow.
<i>Alex?</i>
Oh, God.
Jesus.
Oh, shit.
Hello, gorgeous.
God.
- Come here.
- No. No!
What are you doing here? No.
Fix your air conditioner.
No. No!
I want a drink.
I want a drink.
And there was somebody
in the apartment when I went back.
You saw somebody?
No, but they were watching...
...from in the closet.
- See, I was looking for the cat.
- Your cat?
Somebody's cat.
A goddamn blue-eyed cat.
Where is he now?
How do I know? On Broadway.
And I got out of there.
You say that you saw
this dead guy on TV?
You sure?
I'm sure.
He was taking pictures of ladies
with biceps and string bikinis...
...and there was a lot of loud music.
That's all you know about the guy?
He takes dirty pictures?
- That and you took him to bed.
- Oh, wait a minute.
He took me. It was- It was his place,
not my place. It happens.
Might just be your way
of making friends.
But you know what's funny?
I didn't like him.
No, I guess you didn't.
I mean, on TV.
- I wouldn't have gone to bed with him.
- You did.
I know.
- I know, but it's funny anyway.
- It's not funny.
You black out, don't you?
My advice, turn yourself in to the cops.
That's what Jacky says.
Who the hell is Jacky, huh?
My hairdresser.
- You told your hairdresser?
- He's also my husband.
You wouldn't understand.
Look...
...Turner, if the cops
get their hands on me...
<i>...they're not gonna look
for anybody else.</i>
- That's not true.
- Because...
Because of the other time.
What other time?
My ex-husband called the cops
and had me booked and tanked.
Jacky did?
Jacky's not my ex-husband.
Before Jacky, there was another guy.
We were kids.
- Why'd he put you away?
- Because he was an asshole.
We were discussing my problem over
a couple of drinks on a weekend...
<i>...and next thing I know, he's bleeding.</i>
And I have a paring knife in my hand.
How long were you inside?
A while.
Three months.
That's long enough to know what it is.
Yep.
You've been drinking
for some time, huh?
We weren't drinking then.
- We were just, like-
- Kids, I know.
Do you really drink now?
No.
When I want.
Who the hell's side are you on, anyway?
Thanks.
- Whose place is this?
- A friend's.
This one alive?
- Maybe you did kill that guy.
- I didn't.
Well, either you did it
and you blacked out...
...or you blacked out
and you were set up.
I choose number two.
- Either way-
- So long, Turner.
- It's been nice talking to you.
- You're a lush with a record.
What do you expect to call somebody
guzzles beer at 9:00 in the morning?
You bought it for me,
you son of a bitch.
- It's stuck. You've got to pull back-
- I know, I know.
Grab it with both hands and shove.
Why don't you get your lousy car fixed.
- I don't have the money.
- Well, get a job, you bum.
In the movies, like you?
Shove it up your lily-white ass, Turner.
Grab it with both hands and shove.
<i>- Come on, Frankie, rise and shine.
- Yeah?</i>
<i>- It's me, Alex.
- Oh, hi, girl. What's happening?</i>
Frankie, you alone?
Yeah. Yeah.
<i>You won a million dollars!</i>
God, who are all these people?
What's everybody doing up?
- It's 2 in the afternoon, Frankie.
- What a night. You should've been here.
- Or were you?
- I need help.
Oh, honey, don't we all?
No, listen, I don't have time.
- I need clothes, makeup.
- And a dye-job.
Honey, you know where everything is.
You help yourself.
What do you think?
Oh, God. Frankie, don't you have
anything simpler?
- You know, a little less...
- I'm a drag queen, not a transvestite.
I don't buy no housedresses.
There is- There is a thing I bought
last year for a date at the bistro.
He was with the Mafia.
Real sweet. And they're conservative.
Wait.
- Oh, God.
- Your basic black.
Don't tell me it won't start.
- I wanna help you.
- Who, me? The drunk?
Yeah, that's what you are, all right.
- Then what do you wanna help me for?
- Because you're innocent.
There was no body
in your shower last night.
And why would you put one in there
after I left?
Somebody in the closet.
That could mean you were set up.
If you were set up,
it might be somebody you know.
I gotta call Jacky. Maybe he can help.
He's smart.
- He knows the people in charge.
- In charge of what?
Everything. The world.
He's a hairdresser.
That's what he does.
It's not what he is.
How long you been separated?
- We were married 10 years.
- How long ago did you separate?
Ten years ago.
- Must be lovely growing old together.
- We gave it a try, and it didn't work.
But, you know, when we separated,
we got close.
It's funny, but- I don't know,
I guess it's not so funny.
He loves me and...
And I helped him.
I- I put up a chunk of my savings
for his first shop.
When I stopped getting parts
in pictures...
Jacky takes care of me.
Whose idea is staying married?
Both of us.
I think I help him out with those
Beverly Hills clients he scores.
So he's straight, huh?
Yes, Turner, there are
straight hairdressers.
In Bakersfield, Jacky's a gay name.
His name is Joaquin Manero.
You married...
...a Spanish man, huh?
Give you a little body on the top. Okay?
Jacky, these two gentlemen
are here to see you.
Oh, and...
<i>...viveca called. She said she'll call back.</i>
She can't be reached.
Is this a good place to talk?
No.
Was she having something
with this guy she killed?
Come on. Viveca never killed anybody.
Stiffs just use her apartment
to take showers in?
- Who told you to look there?
- We're detectives.
She's not capable of it. I know her.
She got a violent record.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Did you know that
when you married her?
It's why I married her.
Are you just here passing the time,
or should I call my lawyer?
It's a great place for a stud.
Or are you a fag, Jacky?
How bad do you wanna know?
He's not in his office.
I called his car, and he's not there.
Listen, viveca, there's this cop that
I know with Homicide, right here in L.A.
No.
- Maybe he can help.
- No cops.
Just on the phone.
Why should I trust
some cop pal of yours?
I don't know. He's Jewish.
Come on.
Sergeant Greenbaum.
A friend of yours said I should call.
Yeah. Hello.
I'm calling about a body.
<i>Any particular body?</i>
The one-
The one on 1560 Sweetzer.
Mr. Korshack.
That body, yeah.
Hey, your friend doesn't want you
to trace this call.
What about Korshack?
Hello?
- Are you Viveca Van Loren?
- I didn't do it.
- I'd like to hear your side. Maybe we-
- I just...
I thought you should know
that where he wound up...
<i>...isn't- It's not where he started.</i>
<i>- So to speak.
- So to speak?</i>
If I tell you where it happened, maybe
you can find out how it happened.
<i>- Are you giving me a clue?
- An address. I'm giving you an address.</i>
He was killed in a loft apartment
at 544 Mateo Street.
<i>And I think you should look
for fingerprints inside the closet.</i>
<i>Near the entrance.</i>
<i>- Just go over there right now.
- Oh, by the way...</i>
<i>...who's the friend
that recommended me to you?</i>
This whole area.
All gonna go get turned into
black-glass skyscrapers.
The smart ones...
...are making a bundle holding out,
like this Korean landlord that I got.
He's been here less than 10 years,
owns half of L.A.
They say Orientals have bigger brains
than us. You think so?
Sounds reasonable.
Maybe I should go in first,
turn some lights on.
I only came to L.A. a while ago
with my wife.
A month after that...
...we got divorced.
She went back...
- ... and we split up the stuff.
- Everybody gets divorced.
Well, I don't believe in divorce.
You don't believe in it?
I hate it.
- Why'd you do it?
- She did.
<i>She said I wasn't...</i>
...promising.
Left you her cookery stuff, huh?
That was mine.
He cooks too?
You're quite a find, Turner.
She must've been crazy.
Oh, I don't know, I-
I see her point.
Don't you lie about anything?
Yeah, sure.
What's worth Iying about?
You're a great reader, huh?
Those?
Well, no, I mean...
...I plan on reading them when I-
When I have the time, you know.
I just...
...buy books.
Quarter apiece sometimes in Santa
Monica. Even by the pound sometimes.
<i>I can't resist. All the...</i>
All the subjects interest me.
I'll get to them.
What's keeping you so busy?
Oh, you know, nothing.
Daily life.
That'll do it, daily life.
Oh, my God. Nancy Drew.
- It's a complete set.
- Yeah, I'm saving those for my daughter.
Only she just- She just told me
she's too old for them now.
Too old? Oh, I always loved her.
Oh, God, Nancy Drew.
<i>She's so smart and,
I don't know, outgoing and...</i>
Do you want them?
- What?
- You can have them if you like.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
- Why not?
- No, really.
- Please.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
All right.
Good.
I'd love them.
God, when I'm in the clear.
Yeah, when you're in the clear.
Been a long one, huh?
What do we do now, Turner?
Wait for Greenbaum to do his stuff.
Waiting for Greenbaum.
I think I saw the play.
You're a rare dame, viveca.
Listen...
<i>...viveca's my fake name.</i>
<i>I'm really...</i>
I'm Alex Sternbergen.
<i>Weren't you...</i>
...a sports announcer out of Cincinnati?
Alex for Alexandra.
That's nice.
I like it too.
Like in arguments,
it's harder to yell Alexandra.
So...
...would you mind
if I call you Alexandra?
If you promise not to yell it.
Oh, I won't yell it.
Do you have anything to drink?
Well, I got some vodka.
You want some?
No.
What's going on, Turner? Do you know?
Well, tomorrow I'm gonna go over
to the loft and see what-
Here, I mean. Now.
Yeah, I know.
What is it? We wanna get laid?
Why do you do that?
What?
You haven't wanted
to get laid in years.
I didn't say you haven't been.
I said, you hadn't wanted to in years.
Well, then...
Hey.
Stay until morning?
Sure, darling, I live here.
Don't you drink?
<i>You'd think...</i>
<i>...they'd mention the one
fucking good film I made.</i>
You were asleep on the couch
this morning-
- I heard you go.
- Why didn't you say hello?
I went over...
<i>...to Martineau's, that place you said
you were at. Korshack was never there.</i>
Then where'd I meet him?
- You don't know, huh?
- No.
Yeah.
In bed.
Well, you made a call at Martineau's,
and you got a call.
Well?
- You remember nothing?
- No.
None of it?
- Do you remember last night?
- Yes!
I was thinking somebody might've
asked you to leave on the phone.
- Why'd they pick on me, Turner?
- Why not? You're perfect for it.
You got a record.
You're a blackout drunk.
You've pissed away half of your life.
But you made such a success
out of yours?!
Restoring fucking toasters?
- You don't know what it's like!
- What?
Losing it!
What'd you ever have to lose?
- I was an actress.
- You drink, Alexandra!
- Oh, you're yelling.
- Fucking booze!
You're yelling.
Don't you wanna know
what's going on?
I gotta get out of here.
- Go where?
- Where does Greenberg live?
- Greenbaum.
- Oh, they live together. Isn't that sweet?
Hey.
Will you do me a favor?
Have I ever denied you anything?
Stay here.
I'll be back.
Viveca.
- Have you seen the paper yet today?
- No. I picked up a copy at the airport...
<i>...but haven't had a chance to read it.</i>
Yeah, Jacky reached me in Tokyo.
About an 88-hour time difference...
...but you know Jacky
when he wants to do something.
- He spoke to you?
- Well, I...
I assumed he'd already spoken to you.
Wait a minute.
- Spoken to me?
- Well, isn't that why you're here?
- Why?
- Well, we worked it out together...
...he and I, before I left for Tokyo
last Monday.
Monday?
- Welcome back, Mr. Hurley.
- Thank you.
- Wait.
- Messages can wait, Miss Rose.
Yes, Mr. Hurley.
<i>It's just a simple matter of formalizing
what's been the de facto truth...</i>
...between the two of you
for some time now.
You do want me to handle it, don't you?
- What is there to handle?
- The divorce.
What else?
Nothing else.
That's the woman. The blond.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Well, not to swear in court.
I heard her yelling and then...
...I just caught a quick look at her
as she ran down the hall.
- And what was she yelling?
- She was threatening somebody.
What was she threatening to do?
It was more ranting and raving.
<i>- She was drunk.
- I wouldn't say...</i>
Well, she could've been.
Did you ever see her before? Did she
visit that second-floor apartment often?
Not to my knowledge.
That's how I put it to the police.
All right, thank you.
- You're locking your cat out.
- I wouldn't own a cat.
Whose little cat are you, blue eyes?
Hey!
I'll look in on you
in just a few minutes.
Where the hell have you been?
Change my looks, will you?
It's a mistake.
What about color?
Natural.
Give me a hint.
Some kind of brown.
What?
- What is it?
- Come on, Jacky.
I talked to Hurley.
He must've called you.
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do.
That's what's sad.
Doesn't even have anything to do
with the jam I'm in.
- He said you talked to him a week ago.
- He did?
You couldn't come to me?
We didn't even have a fight.
- You had to go to a fucking lawyer.
- He's your lawyer too.
Was my lawyer.
You have all the business now.
It's just legal shit. I'm going public.
You know what that is?
Selling stock. So?
It gets complicated.
It's not so complicated.
You met somebody, didn't you?
Anybody I know?
Isabel Harding.
You're kidding.
No.
- Harding? As in Pasadena?
- Bel Air.
I love her anyway.
She a client?
- Sometimes you do her in her home?
- Once in a while.
- Beautiful place, huh?
- Beautiful enough, yeah.
- All that money.
- I got money.
But with the Hardings, it's so much
more. There's all that breeding.
Is that it? That early American stuff?
I don't give a damn about
all that early American stuff.
<i>But if you're talking about...</i>
...clout...
...yeah.
Sure, Jacky.
You've been on the outside
long enough, huh?
- Now you want in.
- I want in.
- Right. Joaquin Manero.
- You're damn right.
- You afraid of being bored to death?
- Not a bit.
She's probably no more boring
than the rest of us.
Yes, she is.
Hey, Turner, you moving to L.A.?
Thinking about it.
How you been, sergeant?
- Bakersfield's a long commute.
- Oh, I'm not with them anymore.
- What brings you down here?
- Homicide. What else?
- The Korshack thing.
- Oh, it doesn't ring a bell.
- I'm surprised.
- Why is that?
Well, it made the news.
The deceased Bobby Korshack
had a little something to do...
...with dirty pictures or art...
...depending upon how you feel
about naked ladies.
The prime suspect is known to us,
as they say.
- Well, you guys are good.
- Well, we got some problems.
Where he was killed, the body
was moved, the place was cleaned up.
So there's no blood, no weapons,
no signs of violence.
<i>I'm talking about the kind of cleaning...</i>
...my wife would go crazy
to find somebody to do for us.
Just a strand of hair. Not Korshack's.
- What color?
- Blond.
A real blond?
Who knows these days.
Also, it could've came from a wig.
Well, the lab will tell you that.
You were wasted up there
in Bakersfield, Turner.
She's still at large.
- Who's that?
- The prime suspect.
Actual movie star. Viveca Van Loren.
- She should be easy to find.
- She's been quick.
But I'm gonna give her
24 hours anyway.
Why is that?
On the outside chance
she didn't do it.
Somebody out there knows she didn't.
Nice to see you again, Herb.
Same here.
Take care of your kitty, Turner.
Charlie, call Records.
Run a check on a cop.
Probably ex-cop, out of Bakersfield.
Retired, fired or disabled.
See if he's getting any checks forwarded.
I want a L.A. address for him.
Name's Kendall, first name Turner.
My God.
It's Alexandra Sternbergen.
It's not gonna hide you for long, babe.
No, I know. I'm okay. I got a place.
Where?
A guy. He's got an apartment.
- Sort of.
- Who, Frankie?
No. A guy I met by accident.
It's okay, Jacky. You don't
need to know. Just stay out of it.
Alexandra?
You can't trust some guy
you met in a bar, Alex.
- It was the airport.
- Wherever.
What does he want?
What do you mean? Nothing.
- What was he doing there?
- Seeing his daughter off.
Did you see his kid?
No, but she...
- He knows I'm innocent.
- So do I.
But not because he's my friend.
He saw there wasn't a body
in the shower and then there was.
And then there was.
He put it there.
- No.
- Who else could have?
And so easy.
You were passed out, am I right?
It was when I was talking to you
on the phone. He was there.
- Wasn't he?
- Yes.
And didn't he know
where Korshack was?
- Will you call Hurley?
- First thing in the morning.
You'll be okay here for now.
- You know where everything is.
- Will you stay with me?
I have a dinner date.
With the Hardings?
I'll be back in an hour, an hour
and a half. They go to bed like babies.
Hey, I'll bring Isabel.
Oh, that'll be nice.
Maybe she knows, you know,
a tougher lawyer.
Tougher than Hurley.
You know the kind.
Gentleman-looking,
but a real killer for his client.
- You want me to turn on the tub?
- Oh, no.
Take a rest, babe, okay?
Forget about everything.
Bring me back something from dinner.
I wake up hungry.
I remember.
Sam, pick him up when he reaches
Holden and Washington.
Thank you.
Thank you, all of you.
And thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Harding,
for this lovely dinner.
And for having such a lovely daughter.
And now...
<i>...I'm afraid I have to take her away
from you for this evening.</i>
- Oh, why?
- I'm not supposed to tell.
It's a surprise party.
I never did know how to get someone
to one of those damn things...
...without giving it away.
Neither have I.
Thanks again for everything.
I know we'll see you again soon,
Mr. Manero.
I'm sure of it.
Fred, would you bring
Miss Harding's car around, please?
Jacky?
Jacky?
- Where's Jacky?
- He's coming back!
- Alexandra.
- Oh, God.
Alexandra, there was a double
in that loft.
Somebody wanted to look like you.
They made a fuss, made some threats
so the neighbors would see.
- They did. I talked to her.
- Who'd want to set me up?
Listen to me. Homicide has got
a blond hair from up in the loft.
<i>Now, what I'm saying...</i>
...is that it came from your wig...
...and not from-
What the hell happened
to the bleached blond?
Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.
- Where are your clothes?
We gotta get out of here.
We've gotta get this wig to Greenbaum.
No!
Alex, please.
Please! Please, Alex, please!
- I don't wanna hurt you more.
- Jacky.
- Oh, my God, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.
Alex! Don't.
Jacky, we can't.
Isabel, you killed a man!
Now whatever has to be done!
You set me up to save her?
- Turn the water on!
- Jacky, no.
Do it!
Jacky.
- Who fired?
- That man there.
Call an ambulance.
Cedars? This is Officer Lewis.
We need an ambulance
at 1625 Robertson.
Do what you can.
- Well?
- Very rapid, very weak.
- Barely there.
- Call for a second ambulance.
Lenny, you better get down here.
Just bring everything.
One guy, we don't think
he's gonna make it.
The other one is hurt.
Just get down here. Right now.
Okay, thanks.
Stay down. You'll pass out.
Officer.
Thank God you're here.
He killed Korshack.
And now tonight, that poor man there.
No.
It was her.
Korshack had pictures.
He's been blackmailing her for years.
He threatened to show them
to her father.
My father is Joshua Harding.
- You won't be able to-
- Harding? Is that Judge Harding?
Herb, phone.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
<i>Dr. Klein, will you call extension 7042?
Dr. Klein, call extension 7042.</i>
He's gonna be all right.
What can I do for you?
Nothing, thanks.
It was impounded.
That '63 Mercedes you left
at the airport day before yesterday.
The day before yesterday.
I got it released.
Had them leave it downstairs.
Thank you, Herbie.
L.A.'s hell without a car,
Miss Van Loren.
<i>Dr. Howser, will you call Pathology,
please?</i>
<i>Dr. Howser, please call Pathology.</i>
- Miss?
- Dr. Howser phoned me to meet him.
Who the hell are you?
That sports announcer you liked.
You know, from Cincinnati.
Well, I never liked him.
How'd you get in here?
Dr. Howser said it was okay.
Doctor's name is Pitkin.
I use Howser.
I never trusted Manero,
but I love the way he made you look.
He didn't do it.
I always used to look this way.
Oh, I should've known you then.
Yeah, you should've.
Yeah.
Where is he? Jacky.
- With your pal, Herbie.
- Oh, they got enough on him?
I don't know.
Miss Harding says he killed Korshack,
and he says she did it.
Bye-bye, Jacky.
What do you mean?
Well, who do you think they're
gonna believe, her or some-?
Some guy named Joaquin Manero?
Who do you believe?
I think she did it.
<i>I think they'II...</i>
...put him away, and I think...
<i>...she'll do a little time. Or none.</i>
I think that's the way it is.
It's a bitch.
Wanna hand me some water here?
What are you gonna do?
When?
You know.
I don't know yet. Work.
Wait for you to get sprung.
<i>That's a nice thought...</i>
...but all we know about each other is
a day and a half on the run...
...and somebody trying to kill us.
Brings people together.
<i>May be a good way to start.
Hell, the rest'll be like...</i>
<i>...I don't know, Sunday on the farm.</i>
What do you know about a farm?
Well...
I have great hopes for you, Alexandra.
What about for us?
<i>You don't wanna live with a...</i>
With a lush, is that it?
Would you want to?
I haven't had a drink
in two days and a night.
We say goodbye then?
Yeah.
Whatever makes you happy.
- You been here all night?
- Yeah. I'm just leaving.
Take good care.
Alexandra.
You have a right to know something.
- A right?
- Yeah.
I was...
...a drunk for 10 years.
I got cut, but I was...
...on my way out for a long while.
- You came back.
- Trying to.
It can be done.
I know this trick.
I count to three, you disappear.
One, thanks for visiting.
- You're welcome.
- Two...
...also, it was a pleasure
meeting you, Alexandra.
Yes, it was.
Three...
...good luck.
You too, Turner.
It didn't work.
I never did see that damn trick
done right.
And you never will.
Whatever makes you happy.
You. Oh, you make me happy.
