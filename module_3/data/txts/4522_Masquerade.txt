Drink it.
I said drink.
What are you waiting for?
Punish me with death, Your Majesty.
Punish us with death.
Chief Royal Secretary to see His Majesty.
What happened?
Silver spoon turned black.
I shall have my bedchamber moved at once.
Your Majesty.
You must hold your ground
especially at a time like this.
Is that all you have to say?
What would please your enemies more
than to see you abandon your quarters?
I beg Your Majesty to take heed.
Approach me.
Leave us.
Have you found one?
Forgive me, Sire but...
Make haste.
He must look exactly like me.
I cannot trust anyone.
No one.
I beg Your Majesty to take heed.
We beg Your Majesty to take heed.
Don't you hear the cries of the scholars?
I beg you to allow an
inquisition of Yu Jeong-ho.
We beg of Your Majesty.
No, Your Majesty! If you allow
inquisitions based on hearsay,
there'll be a flood of
unjustified accusations
giving rise to great disarray.
You are crossing the line Chief Secretary!
How dare you dismiss the advice
of the King's loyal servants?
It worries me that you're
giving weight to rumor
when there are more urgent
outstanding state affairs.
What is more urgent than treason?
Your Majesty.
Yu Jeong-ho must be put to death at once.
No, Your Majesty!
Punishment can wait until right
and wrong has been determined.
Yu Jeong-ho is a dangerous man.
Give us a royal command, Your Majesty.
Your command, Your Majesty.
His Majesty the King!
Your Majesty.
Yu is a heretic who rejects
orthodox teachings.
Retribution for his crime
must not be delayed.
We beg Your Majesty to take heed.
I beg Your Majesty to take heed.
Tread on our backs if you must.
We beg of Your Majesty.
This time,
they will really have my brother beheaded.
Madam.
This madness will only end
upon my death.
His Majesty the King!
The King climbs over the
wall and opens the door
asking for Hong-jin.
Hong-jin.
Where are you, my dear?
Gotcha!
You're hiding here.
Come on out.
Come on out of there.
Oh my!
Let's see.
Aren't you voluptuous?
You're a lucky man.
Your Majesty.
You call upon me without notice again.
If you keep doing this, I fear
it will be the death of me.
Come here, whore.
The King takes her soft hand
and pulls her deep into the Court.
He reaches for her undergarment
and her ample derriere rubs
against his royal body.
The King smiles happily.
Then, once on the left
and once on the right
and flips her over for some more.
Watching the sunrise in the east,
screw, screw!
Watching the sunset in the west,
screw, screw!
Screw here and screw there
all night long.
Take off the cover.
Sir, sir.
Listen to me, I beg of you.
The King involving himself
with the court ladies
is such an absurd idea.
Something that can never
happen in real life
and what makes it interesting.
Help him up.
With all due respect, sir
who are you?
Listen to me carefully if you wish to live.
In a moment, you shall have
an audience with the King.
Sir?
When His Majesty asks you a question,
respond with "Yes, Your Majesty".
When a longer answer is required,
you must answer by saying
"If it pleases Your Majesty".
You must not ask questions
or look upon his face.
Make him presentable to the King.
Lift your head.
Repeat what I say.
Is anyone there?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I said repeat.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Insufferable wretch!
Is that all you have to say?
If it pleases Your Majesty.
Repeat what I say, "Is anyone there?"
I said repeat.
Insufferable wretch!
Is that all you have to say?
Not bad indeed.
He performs masked farce
at courtesans' house.
Judging from his basic knowledge
of Chinese characters,
I presume he is not of the low birth.
Repeat what I say.
Is anyone there?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Would you care for a night snack?
All right.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Have a night snack brought in.
Have plenty brought in.
You scared me!
Calling upon me so frequently
will upset the Queen.
Will it not?
What choice do I have?
I only sleep soundly next to you.
Get up.
Sir.
You can go now.
Once every 3 nights, when
the curfew bell sounds
wait by the west palace gate.
Don't be late.
You shall not speak of
anything about tonight.
You found the right man.
Follow me looking at my heels only.
Be careful.
Three!
Spare me, My Lord!
He was charged with
telling of lewd stories.
I beg of you! I never knew
it constituted a crime.
I'm telling the truth.
The gentry talk of far more
lewd things, do they not?
Who are you comparing yourself to?
Four.
Four!
Whoever it was that ratted me out,
- I shall kill the wretched bastard.
- Five.
Five!
Hold it.
Does it hurt?
Spare me, my Lord.
I hear about
a new young courtesan who
just arrived at Honglu.
How about it?
Her, in exchange for this.
But it's not up to me to decide.
- My Lord!
- Hit the shit out of him.
Save me, my Lord!
Take all the time you need, Miss.
Did you say you were from Jeonju?
Yes.
How old are you?
Fifteen.
I am terribly sorry.
I miss my mama.
Not a single chick was killed.
If arsenic was present,
even in the smallest dose
it would have killed the chicks.
If it wasn't poison, what
turned the spoon black?
Recently, they started using
bamboo salt to season King's food.
Bamboo salt?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The iron found in bamboo salt
changed the color of the spoon.
I implore you, Sire and I
offer my head to say this.
If this is about Yu Jeong-ho,
I shall not hear more of it.
Forgive me, Your Majesty
but Yu Jeong-ho would never
plot treason against you.
Enough!
I know it, too.
Yu is my loyal servant and
trusted brother-in-law.
But I'll need to sacrifice someone like Yu
in order to gain their trust.
Sir,
the royal physician sent for you.
Come this way.
It appears that he's been poisoned.
Will he recover?
Forgive me but,
I cannot confirm anything at this point.
We may need to prepare
for a national calamity.
Who else knows about this?
So far, only myself and Chief Eunuch.
I shall take full responsibility
for what I'm about to say.
Both you and Chief Eunuch
shall remain silent about
His Majesty's condition.
But, sir!
You know better than anyone
that you will not live
if the King passes away.
If the word about the
King's condition gets out
the Court will fall into
unimaginable chaos.
That is clearly what the
conspirator wanted.
The King is confined to
bed because of cold.
Please wake Captain Do
and fetch the jester at once.
Take His Majesty to a remote temple.
Absolutely no one is to know about this
until the poison is identified
and His Majesty recovers.
It's not the night we arranged.
The King must be going somewhere nice.
I see the beating didn't teach you anything
I beg your pardon?
Was it you that ratted me out?
I don't know how to thank you!
It was indeed an insufferable
crime to make fun of the King
and the magistrate who took the
girl's virginity for my crimes
is innocent.
But what did that
15-year-old girl do wrong?
Was there any untruth in what I said?
Don't let your tongue run wild.
It's Captain Do.
His Majesty wishes to stay
in his quarters tonight.
I shall escort him out as
soon as the King is finished.
Hitting me and shit.
Where is His Majesty?
The King is unwell.
Oh.
How sick is he?
Is it serious?
You'll have to act as his
stand-in for a while.
For how long?
There is nothing for you to worry
as long as you do as I say.
I won't do it.
Wretch!
It's for the good of the kingdom.
And none of my concern.
You're asking me to put
my neck on the line.
I can't do it.
It's 20 silver coins now.
I shall give you 20 more after.
My life for a few coins...
I'm not that crazy.
Did you say 'for the good of the kingdom'?
The good of the kingdom means
the good of the people.
Man, what's happening.
I trust you'll keep your
word about the balance.
His Majesty has a terrible cold
and shall not be attending
this morning's conference.
The morning conference will
be held again in three days.
The first thing to learn are
those nearest to the King.
You have already met Chief
Eunuch and Captain Do.
Lady Han is King's designated court
lady who serves him closest.
Your Majesty.
The Queen asks for an audience.
The Court has eyes and ears everywhere.
You shall take extra care at all times.
What do you mean?
Is he so terribly ill?
Your Highness.
Tell him I need to see him urgently.
Your Royal Highness.
Is he with a court lady?
You won't get near the
Queen or the concubines
and be extra cautious not
to chance upon the Queen.
You may resemble the King
but you won't fool those who
share the bed with him.
I told the officials you can't speak
due to a troubled throat.
If there is anything you need to ask,
ask Chief Eunuch.
Can I ask something?
Come closer.
You know I...
I'm sorry but I need to take a dump.
I couldn't find a toilet for two days.
Ask for a plum blossom pot.
I need that right away.
You.
What are you waiting for?
Leave me.
I need to take a crap. Get the hell out.
Hurry!
Your Majesty.
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?
Back off.
Punish me with death, Your Majesty.
Why would I kill you?
Just leave me.
Leave me.
Your Majesty.
Don't come any closer.
When you wake in the
morning, clear your throat.
Court ladies will bring
in water for washing up.
You could've told me that earlier.
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
Congratulate what?
There is no outhouse for the King.
Ask for a plum blossom pot.
I already know that.
Where are they taking it to?
It's sent to the royal physician
to check the color and hardness
and taste.
They taste it?
Next are the royal concubines.
So many of them!
Eunuch Kim!
It's Eunuch Jo, Sire.
Eunuch Jo,
I heard that the King shares his bed
with his concubines every night
for a royal coitus.
It's a matter concerning the
inner affairs of the Court.
I was just worried that one of
the concubines might pay a visit.
I can only refuse so many times.
Not to mention they might get suspicious.
So... can I?
I beg your pardon?
Just an amusing thought.
The King's taster tastes the food
to check for any poisons.
Meals are served twice a day
in the morning and evening.
For light meals and snacks,
- he favors buckwheat and dumplings.
- Bring it in.
Take it out.
That was good.
I thought I had a big appetite
but the King must be quite
a big eater himself.
The court ladies at the royal kitchen
eat the leftovers from King's table.
Are you telling me
that they starved all day because of me?
They are only allowed to cook
for the King and for him alone.
That is quite astonishing.
No wonder they were
looking at me horrified.
That lady over there.
Who is she?
It's Her Royal Highness the Queen Consort.
That makes her...
Oh!
The Chief Secretary insisted
upon avoiding her at all costs.
The morning conference was
postponed for three days.
But the individual audiences
cannot be delayed any more.
You'll only need three phrases
during the individual meetings.
Do as you see fit.
Next.
Bring him in.
Go on.
Do as you see fit.
I'm sorry.
Wretch!
Have you not heard His Majesty's voice?
Keep it low and solemn.
As you see fit.
Do as you see fit.
Your grace is immeasurable.
Bring in the next.
Morning conference is vitally important.
It is where high-ranking officials gather
to hear the King's decrees.
Mistakes will not go unnoticed.
Yes, sir.
First row on the left,
two down from the left
is Ha, the Tax Minister.
For the sake of power, he will
happily walk into a manure tub.
Next to him is Kim Jong-se,
the Justice Minister.
He is a greedy and cruel character
who will chase his enemies
to the end of days.
The man that always agrees
to the Justice Minister is.
Inspector General, Lee Yun-sang.
All that he cares about
is maintaining his position.
At the rightmost of the first row is.
Park Chung-seo, the Minister of Interior.
You must remember him.
Don't you see what the
King is trying to do?
The King is giving us Yu Jeong-ho
to diverting our attention from issues
such as troop dispatch or
the uniform land tax law.
Is it not the truth?
His eyes are as sharp as a hawk's and
his character as venomous as a viper's.
From this moment on,
you shall address me and the Chief
Eunuch the way you would a servant.
Sir?
Remember,
the Court has eyes and ears everywhere.
What you have in front of you
is the royal decree to be passed
down at the conference tomorrow.
Read it out loud, Your Majesty.
I command my trusted council,
Tax Minister shall draw a bill to...
Stop!
His Majesty is a king,
not a storyteller from market place.
Low and solemnly.
Like a king.
I command my trusted council,
Tax Minister,
draw up a bill to restore
the uniform land tax law.
Minister of Construction,
stop the palace renovation immediately.
How can you justify renovating the palace
at the cost of my good people?
Minister of Justice,
I shall not question the wrongdoings
of Magistrate Yu Jeong-ho.
All treason must be dealt
with the strictest law.
But the law must not be used
to punish the innocent.
I command my trusted council.
Those that disturb the peace of the Court
by stirring up groundless accusations
shall be dealt as strictly
as those guilty of treason.
This concludes the morning conference.
Yes, Your Majesty.
The morning conference is prepared.
His Majesty the King!
His Majesty the King!
The morning conference shall commence.
His Majesty shall pass
down the royal decree.
Your Majesty.
I heard you suffered from a terrible fever.
How does Your Majesty feel this morning?
Quite well.
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.
Your grace is immeasurable.
This is a blank scroll.
Due to the pain in the throat.
His Majesty shall not read
out the royal decree.
I'll do the honor on His Majesty's behalf.
Tax Minister.
Yes, Your Majesty.
You shall draw up a bill to
restore the uniform land tax law.
Justice Minister.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Prepare a report on which regions
the law should be enforced first.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Trusted servants, hear my words.
I shall no longer question the
wrongdoings of Yu Jeong-ho.
Any man found guilty of disturbing the
peace with groundless accusations
shall be punished severely.
I trust you shall endeavor
to fulfill the royal decree.
This concludes the morning conference.
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.
Revive the identification system?
And restore the uniform land tax law?
The passing of the bill wasn't
delayed for our interest.
The Chief Secretary is
to blame for this mess.
Didn't I make that clear earlier?
He disturbs peace with
his three-inch tongue.
The King has ordered for reports.
What should I do now?
Who made this red bean porridge?
Your Majesty didn't appear
to have fully recovered.
I asked you who made it.
The taster asked the palace
matron at the royal kitchen.
It tastes really good.
Just like what I used to eat as a child.
What is your name?
Lady Han, Sire.
And yours?
Your Majesty, it's Sa-wol.
How old are you?
Fifteen, Sire.
Fifteen.
I'm done for now. Clear the table.
You heard His Majesty. Make haste.
Yes, sir.
I missed you, good old rice!
Stock up while you can.
You don't know when he'll
get his appetite back.
My Lady.
Do you think the King has changed recently?
What do you mean by that?
His complexion as well as his palate.
He chuckles a lot, too.
And Yeong-yi told me
that even the sound of his royal
defecation has changed.
Fortunately, his pulse is returning.
But, sir
it appears that he's been
drugged not poisoned.
What do you mean by that?
Where has he been going on his outings?
He's been avoiding royal coitus?
How on earth could I know?
I hear he is staying clear of the
concubines and the Queen, too.
The rumor has spread all over the Court.
He is avoiding the sweet smell of women
that he favors so much.
My Lord.
My Lord.
The Chief Secretary is up to something.
He's been enquiring about Lady Ahn.
What should we do?
Take some men and burn down
the poppy patch at once.
We must get rid of all evidence.
Lady Ahn has been in the
wind for a few days now.
As you see fit.
Your grace is immeasurable.
Did you dissent the uniform land tax bill?
But that's what you told me to do.
To respond to whatever
the officials say with:
Do as you see fit.
Did you approve the
interrogation of Yu Jeong-ho?
No, I didn't do that.
I only approved the setting up
of an inquisitorial committee.
That's the same thing!
Didn't I warn you to be extra
cautious around Park Chung-seo?
I'll call for a high officials' meeting.
You will announce the reintroduction
of the uniform land tax bill.
Why keep making me change my words?
Just do as I say.
You must give to take.
That's politics.
Shouldn't I know what I'm
giving away and taking
at least?
Do you know, Chief
what the big deal is about
the identification law and
the uniform land tax law?
I do not, Sire.
What do I need to know anyway?
I only need to do as I'm told.
But I can get you books on the subject.
If everyone carries an identification tag,
it would be easy to check the identity
and convenient for taxation purposes.
Not for everyone, Sire.
An identification tag carries with it
the duty of compulsory labor.
There are people who abandon
their tags and cross the border
or voluntarily get castrated
to become a eunuch.
You mean they cut off their own balls?
That means such eunuchs
could be in this Court.
Do you know anyone?
Chief.
It might be an awkward question.
Ask me anything, Sire.
Do you really not have it?
I do not, Sire.
Then, when you go to the outhouse
do you do it standing up
or sitting down?
Well.
It must have hurt.
Chief Secretary!
Your Majesty!
Chief Secretary.
Chief Secretary.
Chief Secretary.
Chief Secretary.
Your Majesty.
The king never comes to his servant.
But you're a busy man.
Let me ask you a question.
I stayed up all night studying
and I think the uniform land
tax law is a really good law.
So why was it abolished
only after a year?
Sire.
Secretary.
It's not a question of right and wrong.
Politics is just politics.
There are a lot of suspicious eyes.
Return to your quarters at once.
Have a man watch the Secretary.
I want to know his every movement.
Yes, sir.
I just don't understand.
Why does everyone get so sensitive
whenever the uniform
land tax law is mentioned?
Probably because of
resistance by landowners.
It's only fair to impose tax
according to how much land you own.
Those who have more
should contribute more.
Sire, Your way of speaking
resembles the King more and more.
Is that so?
I sometimes feel like the real King.
Your Majesty, a night snack is ready.
Bring it in.
Sa-wol.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Did you say you were fifteen?
I am, Sire.
How did you end up living in the Court?
Here
I'm only asking out of curiosity.
You may answer freely.
My father was a tenant farmer
in the mountainous region.
Then one day, he was told
to pay tax in abalone.
Abalone from a farmer?
What happened?
He had to borrow at high interest.
Debt begot more debt.
We ended up losing the house
and the little land we owned.
My father was jailed.
Oh dear.
When that still wasn't
enough to pay off the debt.
My mother and brother were sold as slaves
and I, to a deputy minister's household.
Insufferable!
My father was left by himself.
He never recovered from
the injuries of the torture
and passed away in the same year.
Fucking bastards!
Sire!
Don't you miss your mother?
If only I knew whether she lives or not.
I have no other wish in the world.
I'll reunite you with your
mother before this act is over.
Your grace is immeasurable.
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.
You may leave now.
Tell me, Chief.
What can I do about the bastards
who squeeze pennies from the weak and poor?
Order the Royal Investigation Bureau.
But that takes too long.
I don't know how long
I'll be playing the King.
Then.
Then?
It's nothing, Sire.
Oh, come on!
Tax Minister.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Did I not command you to
reintroduce the tax reform bill?
Sire.
If you change the law overnight,
the burden on landowners
will become unbearable.
Do not discriminate landowners
for they are your loyal subjects, too.
Taxing 10 bags of rice for those
who own 10 patches of rice paddy
and 1 for those who own 1.
How is that discrimination?
When people are voluntarily
becoming slaves and eunuchs,
how can you talk of discrimination
over a landowner's bag of rice?
Bring in the prisoner.
That man is the magistrate for Gangwon
who extorted money from the commoners.
The officials who took bribes from him
and those that took bribes
from those officials,
I shall hear all their names.
Which of you can swear that
he didn't receive from this man?
Tax Minister!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Those who abuse King's tribute for
usury shall be punished severely.
As His Majesty orders.
Justice Minister.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Have all magistrates
open their repositories
and return all rice and
linen back to the people.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I command my trusted council
to have uniform land tax
law enforced immediately.
Anyone that obstruct the
execution of this decree
shall be punished with utmost severity.
Your grace is immeasurable.
You're running state affairs as you please.
But we got the uniform land tax law.
Do you even know who Yu Jeong-ho is?
You must give to take.
Isn't that what politics is about?
Politics is no marketplace haggling!
Someone might hear us.
Please act more appropriately
around the King.
Yu Jeong-ho is
the Queen's brother.
Pardon me?
They are accusing him of treason
in order to depose the Queen.
She is the mother of this kingdom.
- How dare they?
- Sire.
King's taster to see His Majesty.
Let her in.
The inquisition makes one confess
to crimes he never committed.
I was prepared to sacrifice
the land tax bill
in exchange of Yu's life.
What do I do now?
Absolutely nothing.
If you wish to help me and the Court.
Her Royal Highness to see His Majesty.
Tell her I'm in bed.
I trusted Your Majesty.
If Your Majesty finds me so unbearable,
grant me the relief of death.
What are you doing?
Can you please drop the knife?
I shall spare the life
of Yu no matter what.
Do you give your word?
You have my word.
Would you please come down?
If Your Majesty doesn't keep his word,
it shall be the death of me.
All right.
His Majesty the King!
Why did you do it?
You're my brother-in-law. Why
did you conspire against me?
Answer me.
Your humble servant remembers the King
who always put the benefit
of the people before all.
But you're no longer the King
I swore to serve.
Deafened by corrupt officials
and blinded by wicked women,
you've become nothing but a tyrant.
How dare you, in the
presence of His Majesty?
So, what did you do?
Did you plot treason?
No, my Lord! Never!
Did you round up a militia?
I would never dream of such things.
Then, what did you do?
I pleaded that you open your ears.
I called out that you listen.
Punish me with death, Your Majesty.
You called out.
That's all?
Release him.
Sire, it cannot be done.
The man is guilty of treason.
What treason?
Minister, can you declare
with a clear conscience
that your intentions are
purer than this man?
Step forward if you dare say so.
Release him
for he is guilty of no crime.
Is that how he wants to play?
Chief.
Your Majesty.
I would like to be alone for a moment.
But, Sire...
Only for a moment.
Retire to your quarters, Captain.
It's against the laws of the Court.
The laws of the Court are above the King?
Your Highness, Yu Jeong-ho was released.
What they say about
His Majesty must be true.
He laughs more
and at night, focuses
only on state affairs.
Your Highness?
With Your Highness'
permission, I shall retire.
What brings you here, my Lord?
Don't you find it amusing?
I do, my Lord.
Yet, you do not smile.
Your Majesty.
What in Heaven's name?
Sire?
Why did you do that?
I released Yu as I promised.
I heard so.
You should return the favor.
I'm at your service.
Give me a smile.
I beg your pardon?
Smile for me once.
Is it so hard? I kept my promise.
Come on.
Your Majesty!
I shall retire to my chamber.
Were you with Her Royal Highness?
What's the matter?
Nothing, Sire.
Chief Eunuch.
Did you notice anything
different about His Majesty?
How do you mean?
It's not just one or two things.
His way of speaking and acting.
Even his hands look different.
Captain, you worry too much.
If you'll excuse me.
Captain Do seems to have sensed something.
Perhaps we best tell him.
No.
We cannot anticipate how he would react.
His Majesty is coming
back into consciousness.
Just a few more days.
Your Royal Highness.
These are the words of His Majesty.
Queen's complexion appears poor.
Have this red bean porridge
and regain your health.
I heard them. Leave me now.
If it pleases Your Highness,
His Majesty ordered that I see you have it
and bring back the empty bowl.
Chief Royal Secretary to see His Majesty.
About Yu Jeong-ho.
Didn't I make it clear not to
interfere with state affairs?
I know.
There are laws in the Court
even for the Queen's siblings.
But surely, King's words override...
Wretch!
Don't you know that even the King
cannot act solely upon his will?
And you are not the King.
You said the Court has
eyes and ears everywhere.
Why do you talk to me in that manner?
King's taster to see His Majesty.
Let her in.
Let's see.
Cinnamon toffee!
Wait there, Sa-wol.
Secretary, eat this.
Your grace is immeasurable.
Go on.
Suck it.
Chief Secretary is leaving.
Did she have the porridge?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Did she have a message for me?
Tell His Majesty to come to the garden
when the curfew bell sounds
for I wish to speak with him.
Her Highness' message for you, Sire.
I see.
The moon in the sky is
the face of my dearest.
Who cut my dearest's head
and hung it up there?
When the moon comes up I gaze upon it.
What do you think?
Excellent, Your Majesty.
What about you, Captain?
It's befitting the laws of the Court.
And you, Chief?
Who do you refer to as 'moon'?
I cannot tell you.
Perhaps it's best not to recite it.
But two people say it's good.
Yes?
Still, it may not be best to...
Sa-wol.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Tonight's snack is dried
persimmons, your favorites.
I shall leave it all for you.
Your grace is immeasurable.
Chief, you shall not retire
to your quarters tonight
for I will stay up to read.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, it's the curfew bell.
All right.
Eunuch Jo, I thought you were on my side.
On second thought, it is not a bad idea.
Your Majesty.
Wait here.
Do you remember what you said to me
on the day I became Princess Consort?
Well...
Of course you forgot.
It's been so long.
You held my hand and told me
that you would stay by my side
until the end of days.
I can still hear your voice.
It's called 'Face of My Dearest'
The moon in the sky is
the face of my dearest.
Who cut my dearest's head
and hung it up there?
Alas, how much it must hurt!
She smiles not.
When the moon comes up, I gaze upon it
wondering if it is my dearest.
What do you think?
How dare you?
Stand back, Your Highness.
This man is not His Majesty.
Captain!
You may have fooled the
Secretary and Eunuch Jo.
But you cannot fool me.
Withdraw the sword.
How dare you draw your blade upon the King?
If this man is the King,
I shall bite this blade.
It is indeed my Lord the King!
Do you believe that I would
not recognize my King?
Your Majesty, I have a small
red birthmark on my body.
Where is it?
On your left bosom.
Lower that sword at once.
How dare you?
Will you have me reveal my bosom?
Punish me with death, Your Majesty.
I shall pay for my sins with my life.
Long live my King!
I'll fetch the court ladies.
Madam.
Captain! Captain!
Finish this porridge and
come for your sword.
What?
These are the words of His Majesty.
Tell me what your sins are.
Drawing a sword upon
Your Majesty's royal person.
Wrong.
Daring to suspect Your Majesty.
Wrong again.
King's personal guard who
must protect me with his life
bit on the blade to take his own life.
If that does not consist
treason, what would?
I don't care how many times you
draw the sword at my neck.
But you must live in order for me to live.
Don't you understand how
important your life is?
How did the porridge taste?
Sweet and delicious.
You must live to be able to taste.
This sword,
you shall only draw it for me alone.
Remember that.
Do you think he fell for it?
He is a man to be reckoned with.
Sire.
How long was I here?
A fortnight by tomorrow, Your Majesty.
What is that?
It's poppy, Your Majesty.
It's the poison that clouded your mind.
Your Majesty.
Who would do such a thing?
It was Court Lady Ahn.
Minister Park Chung-seo was behind this?
Yes, Your Majesty.
What an evil man!
I'll prepare for your return at once
and reveal their atrocious crimes.
No.
There is no need for rush.
But, Sire.
The Court is in the hands
of Park Chung-seo.
An ill-prepared attack would only backfire.
After all, it wasn't poison.
Let's take care of the double first.
What is the matter?
You care for him now?
No, Sire.
You can't spare the lowly
thing who sat on the throne.
We beg Your Majesty to take heed.
Your Majesty.
As long as the daughter of a
Northerner remains the Queen
plots of treason shall not cease.
Are you suggesting that my
Queen is the root of treason?
In the center of all conspiracies
were the relatives of the Queen.
Your Majesty must uphold
the laws of the Court.
Are you telling me that
ditching the Queen like a dog
would be the law of the Court?
Your Majesty.
You made a promise that you
would depose the Queen
and make the concubine who
carries a royal heir new Queen.
Grant your royal permission.
We beg Your Majesty to take heed.
I shall depose the Queen as you advise me.
However,
if the Queen must be deposed for
not being Westerners like you,
I shall depose myself as well,
since I'm not a Westerner myself.
Withdraw your command, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Withdraw your command! Your Majesty!
I beg Your Majesty to take heed.
Your Majesty.
We beg Your Majesty to take heed.
Get out of my way.
Tread on our backs if you must.
Your Majesty.
Tread on our backs, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
<i>Where are you going?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Please stop.</i>
<i>We'll still be within
the walls of the Court.</i>
<i>Leave this palace, Madam.</i>
<i>You can hide for a while then leave.</i>
<i>I'm the King. I can do as I wish.</i>
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
No one passes this gate, understood?
But, the laws of the Court...
I'm counting on you.
Why are you doing this?
Madam.
Why have pity on me?
Do you feel sorry now
that my end is coming?
Return to your quarters.
You said I promised!
That I would stay by your side
until the end of days.
That I would never let go of your hand.
Don't make me cry, my Lord.
What do you mean there are two kings?
Did you see with your own eyes?
Yes, my Lord.
I see.
If one is an imposter
what will happen if one of them disappears?
First of all, we'll make
sure which is the real King.
Did you look into it?
On the 3rd and 6th when the
King was out on a night trip
night snack was served
in the King's quarters.
Are you certain of it?
It's recorded in the journal
and I checked with the matron.
Good work.
<i>Did you hear the horrid rumors</i>
<i>that His Majesty is not the real King?</i>
<i>Also, the scar on His Majesty's
chest seems to have disappeared.</i>
Is Lady Jeong there?
I shall get going.
Please stay.
Get in the bed, Your Majesty.
I must go see about an urgent matter.
You are my dear husband
before you're my King.
It's the will of the Heavens
that husband and wife unite.
Please take off your robe.
Queen, no! You can't!
You mustn't do this.
Madam.
Madam. Please.
Madam.
Reveal your identity.
What do you mean?
I'm the 15th King of Joseon.
Do you wish to be dead?
Leave at once.
Do you believe you'll live
when the King returns?
Screams will fill the Court again
and I shall one day be deposed.
Your lowly body shall be
thrown in some river.
Where is the King?
Forgive me, Your Highness.
This is the command of the King.
Holding his whereabouts in secret,
having an imposter take his place.
And saving my brother?
All of it was the King's wish?
Or was it yours, Secretary?
Your Highness.
Please turn a blind eye to
it for a few more days.
What will happen when this is over?
To the man that looks like the King.
The Queen knows about it.
She said that I shall be killed.
That if the officials let me live,
the King shall have me killed.
You should've run. Why did you come back?
I remembered the promise.
Take this.
20 more silver coins as I promised.
I ask you if my life is worth
less than that of a chicken.
Shut up and listen.
Leave the Court tomorrow at the
darkest hour of the night.
You have never seen me nor spoken to me.
This is the royal creed for
tomorrow's conference.
Just tell them to do as they see fit.
That will be your last mission
as the King's stand-in.
Sire.
Sa-wol to see His Majesty.
I have a favor for you, Secretary.
I promised her that I
would find her mother.
Please see to the matter on my behalf.
Sa-wol.
Take it.
It's no longer of use for me.
Go on.
Find her mother and get her back to her.
This is not a favor
but my last royal command to you.
Sa-wol.
It's a cinnamon sweet.
Put it in your mouth
and slip it in the porridge.
My Lady, what's in the sweet?
I don't know.
All I know is that if you don't do it,
it'll be the death of you and me.
I heard it was you that ordered
the release of my brother.
Why did you do it?
Why did you go out of your way?
I thought if I did, I could make you smile.
A bright smile on your face.
I'll leave the palace tomorrow night
when the moon is at its highest
I don't care if you stay in
the Court or get thrown out.
Please stay alive.
Including 45,000 silver coins,
70 tributes in 13 categories prepared
for the Imperial Palace of Ming.
I propose Your Majesty to bestow
8 pounds of gold upon the envoy.
What a splendid idea!
Do as you see fit.
As for troop dispatch I propose 500 horses,
3,000 archers, and 1,000 cavalrymen
to be included in the
troop of 20,000 soldiers.
Pulling 20,000 soldiers could make
the northern borders vulnerable.
This country only exists
because of Ming Dynasty.
Even if we get treaded over by the savages
it is only right to pay our
respect to the Emperor of Ming.
Grant your royal permission, Your Majesty.
Grant your royal permission.
Do as you see fit.
Next is the tribute for
Grand Empress Dowager
40 court ladies
150 rolls of beige fine ramie,
150 rolls of white fine ramie,
- 60 sable furs and silk.
- Enough! Enough!
Whose country is this?
What?
Even if we get treaded over by the savages?
If you fancy the Emperor of Ming so much
why don't you hand over
this entire country to him?
- Your Majesty!
- Shame on you.
Fine! I shall dispatch
20,000 soldiers to Ming.
But at the same time, I shall write to Jin.
Write down my words:
I dispatched 20,000 soldiers to
Ming in fear of the Emperor,
but I have no wish to fight Jin.
I ask of the good King of Jin
to return my soldiers unharmed.
How can you turn your back
on our diplomatic policy
and reach out to the savages?
Just how important is state policy
that we must force our good people
to fight someone else's war?
As the King that people
refer to as their husband,
I may steal and take from them,
but I shall not drive them to death.
To me, my country and my people
are hundred folds more precious
than the virtues of state policy.
Let's see.
This porridge tastes better than ever.
I shall never forget this taste.
Sa-wol.
Why do you cry, child?
Sa-wol?
Long live my King.
Sa-wol, Sa-wol.
Sa-wol.
Please put the child down.
Is anyone there?
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
You must live.
Is anyone there?
- Anyone out there?
- Your Majesty.
Sa-wol.
Bring her back.
Tell me, child.
Who gave you poison?
Tell me,
I'm the King.
Your Majesty.
Punish me with death.
I was instigated by Constable Lee.
He said that if I didn't do
it he'll have us killed.
He made me do it.
Punish me with death.
Captain Do.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Have the Constable arrested
and brought to me.
Your Majesty.
If he resists, execute him.
Yes, Your Majesty.
You killed her.
No, Your Majesty I was framed.
Let's see how long you'll be saying that.
We'll all be sent to the death row.
That man is not the King.
How can the King of Joseon
desire to befriend the savages?
Whether he is the King or not
we cannot let him do this.
Who put him on that throne?
How can he treat us like this?
The King is not the King?
You expect me to believe that?
Prime Minister.
Do you remember the scar
on His Majesty's chest?
From the arrow he was hit by
during the Japanese Invasion?
Tell us what you saw.
Isn't she the King's maid?
I haven't seen that scar for weeks.
How do you mean?
Can you bet your life on that?
How can I tell lies here?
How can this be?
Bring me the Chief Scholar.
Is anyone there?
Park Chung-seo got the officials together.
They'll strike with guards any minute.
Take off the royal robe and leave.
No.
Until now, I've lived as a lowly man
but I shall not move an inch
before I avenge Sa-wol's death.
Then, you should become a real king.
Should you wish to avenge her death
and bring justice upon those
that suck on people's blood.
A king that serves his people
like the Heaven.
If that's the king you wish to be,
I shall make it happen.
I...
I wish to be King.
Go to the Royal Secretariat
and bring me the journal
for the last fortnight.
Steal it! Take it from
their hands if you must.
Go, Your Majesty.
Make haste, Sire.
You told Sa-wol to stay alive.
Dying in a robe is a death all the same.
Run.
Run for your life.
Stand back.
You're in presence of the King.
Step aside, Secretary!
We're not here to rise against the King
but to bring down an imposter.
How dare you speak of such a thing?
We shall see whether he is
the real King or not.
- Chief Royal Guard.
- Yes, sir.
Pull the traitor out of there.
His Majesty the King!
How dare you?
Exercise due courtesy for your King.
Sitting on the throne
must have made you crazy.
Who are you calling an imposter?
I'm the King.
Are you really?
If he is indeed the King, he'll
have a scar on his chest.
If not, he is an imposter.
Isn't that true, Secretary?
Take off his robe.
How dare you insult me like this?
I shall have your head.
Your Majesty.
Should you wish to avenge Sa-wol's death
and bring justice upon those
that suck on people's blood.
A king that serves his
people like the Heaven.
If that's the king you wish to be,
I shall make it happen.
I wish to be King.
But if being King means
taking others' lives to save mine...
I shall not have it.
I shall dream my own dreams.
I served two kings.
This is the Royal Secretariat's
journal of the last fortnight.
Please review it.
If you judge that I've been
disloyal, take this servant's head.
<i>Have all magistrates
open their repositories,</i>
<i>and return all rice and linen
back to the people</i>
<i>...To have uniform land tax law
enforced immediately.</i>
<i>I may steal and take from them,</i>
<i>but I shall not drive them to death.</i>
<i>To me, my country and my people
are hundred folds more precious</i>
<i>than the virtues of state policy.</i>
Do you doubt me even with this scar?
Your Majesty!
Punish us with death, Your Majesty!
Round up the traitors.
Royal command shall be upheld.
Stop.
Go.
You'll find a port at the end of the path.
Make haste.
Don't look back.
Step aside
I'm here on royal command.
I abide by the laws of the Court.
If you intend to hurt him,
you must kill me first.
Captain, that man is an imposter.
He is not the real King.
Maybe not to you.
But to me, he is the real King.
<i>In August of the following year,</i>
<i>Chief Royal Secretary, Heo Gyun,
was executed on charges of treason</i>
<i>5 years later; King Gwanghae
was deposed with a coup.</i>
<i>Gwanghae is the only king
