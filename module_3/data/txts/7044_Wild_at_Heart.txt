Hey, Sailor, wait up.
You're mine, baby.
I got something for you.
Marietta tells me you've been
trying to fuck her in the toilets
- for the past ten minutes.
- Oh, man...
You crazy fucking bad boy,
trying to fuck your girl's mama.
Now, tell me, how would that
cute little cunt Lula feel about that?
Uh-oh.
You know, Marietta just gave me this...
- Yeah?
- ...to kill you.
- And afterwards, she said, Lula's mine...
- Sailor, he's got a knife!
Sailor!
No!
Sailor!
- Hello.
- Is Lula there?
- Who is this?
- Sailor Ripley.
Can I talk to Lula?
There's no way in hell
that you're gonna talk to her.
lf you even think about seeing Lula,
you're dead.
What?
You heard me.
And don't you ever call here again.
Mama?
You know who that was.
And you know that you aren't,
and I mean are not gonna see him ever.
End of story.
Like hell.
Lula.
- Ripley!
- Peanut!
Hey, baby!
Wow.
Baby, I got a surprise for you.
What... Hey, my snakeskin jacket!
Thanks, baby!
Did I ever tell you that this here jacket
represents a symbol of my individuality
and my belief in personal freedom?
About 50,000 times.
I got us a room at the Cape Fear.
And guess what.
Powermad's playing at the
- Hurricane.
- Hurricane.
Stab it and steer.
Jeez, Louise, Sailor, baby,
you are something else.
When I was 15,
my mama told me that pretty soon
I'd be starting to think about sex,
and I should tell her
before I did anything about it.
But, honey, I thought you told me your
uncle Pooch raped you when you was 13.
That's true.
Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle.
He was a business partner of my daddy's.
Mama never knew nothing
about me and him,
that's for damn sure.
You know what? You're a pumpkin.
Mommy!
Oh, my God, you sick...
- Get out! You son of a bitch!
- Mommy.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash
three months later
while he was holidaying in Myrtle Beach.
They still got way too much traffic there
for my taste.
Have you been noticing
the buildup in traffic?
Here she goes again.
I'm sorry, Sailor,
but that ozone layer is disappearing.
One of these mornings,
the sun's gonna come up
and burn a hole clean through
the planet like an electrical X-ray.
That ain't never will happen, honey.
At least not in our lifetime.
By then, they'll be driving Buicks
to the moon.
You okay, honey?
That woman's laugh creeps me out.
Sounds like something I heard before.
Sounded like the Wicked Witch.
Just sounded like an old gal
having a good time to me.
You about ready to do some dancing?
Honey, I'm always ready to dance.
But I need my kiss first.
Just one.
I'm gonna hire me a hit man
if you don't help me stop this thing.
I'm going to make a call to Marcello Santos.
Now, Marietta, I am gonna help you,
so don't be getting carried away.
You don't want to bring Santos
and his bunch into this.
You're just jealous of him
'cause he's still sweet on me.
Have you been seeing him again?
Oh, my God.
I don't believe this.
Johnnie Farragut,
who doesn't even trust
his very own Marietta.
All right, I'm sorry, honey. I'm...
I just love you, and it just brings out that
ugly, jealous side. I hate it. God.
No tongue. My lipstick.
Sweetheart, I want you
to stop worrying about me
and start worrying
about how to get Lula away
from that murderer.
Honey, wait a minute, now.
Sailor ain't no murderer.
Now, now, listen to me.
You gotta get off of that kick.
As far as I know,
Sailor was completely clean
before he got involved
with that event with Lula.
And even there, he was trying to protect her.
That crazy Bob Ray Lemon was coming at
both of them with a knife, for God's sake.
He could've killed both of them.
You ought to be thanking him.
I don't even know why
I have to tell you all this, honey.
You was there,
you saw the whole damn thing.
Didn't you?
Sailor boy!
How would you like to fuck Lula's mama?
No, ma'am. I sure don't.
Lula's mama would like to fuck you.
Come on.
Miss Fortune, I really think you need
a cup of coffee. I really do.
Maybe I was there,
but I didn't see anything at all.
And all I know is, is that trash,
he killed a man with his bare hands,
hands that are probably
all over my baby right now.
Honey, come on, now. Settle down.
It's all right. Come on, now.
It's all right. Now, you listen to me.
I want what's best for her, too, honey.
And I'm gonna do everything I can
to bring her back home, all right?
Uh-huh.
Baby, quit bouncing.
I got one more toe to do.
Let's go dancing, peanut.
I'm ready.
But we better be careful,
'cause Mom's gonna have
Johnnie Farragut on us
like a duck on a June bug.
And that Johnnie is one clever detective.
- You know how clever?
- How clever?
He told me once he could find
an honest man in Washington.
Wow.
Just one, two more moments
and my toes will be dry.
You know,
one thing puzzles my mind, sugar.
What's that?
You're 20 years old.
Ain't you ever curious why your mama's
got this fixation on keeping us apart?
I'll tell you, Lula.
Well...
It's more than me killing Bob Ray Lemon.
Well, maybe my mama
cares for me just a little too much.
Yeah, maybe.
I just want to kiss you goodbye.
'Cause you know
too many things about Lula's mama.
What do you mean?
Johnnie told me
you used to be a driver
for Marcello Santos.
So what?
So maybe one night
you got too close to a fire.
So maybe you're gonna burn.
Besides, you're shit.
You think that I'd let my little girl
hang out with a piece of S-H-I-T like you?
Kid, you belong in one of these toilets.
You filthy piece of white trash.
You...
You're gonna have to kill me
to keep me away from Lula.
Don't you worry about that.
And before I do, I'm gonna cut your balls off
and feed them to you.
Gonna have to kill me.
I can arrange that.
It's a problem I don't think
is gonna go away too soon, though.
Peanut, I'm thinking of breaking parole
and taking you out to sunny California.
- Sailor!
- Are you up for that?
I'd go to the far end of the world
for you, baby.
You know I would.
Rocking good news.
Those toenails about dry yet, sweetheart?
We got some dancing to do.
Are you gonna provide me with
an opportunity to prove my love to my girl?
Or are you gonna
save yourself some trouble,
step up like a gentleman
and apologize to her?
Don't fuck with me, man.
You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
This is a snakeskin jacket.
And for me, it's a symbol of my individuality
and my belief in personal freedom.
Asshole.
Come here.
Sailor, honey...
I'm sorry to do this
to you here in front of a crowd and all,
but I want you to get up
and apologize to my girl.
I'm sorry.
Well, hell.
You just bumped up against
the wrong girl, is all.
That's good.
Now, go get yourself a beer.
You fellas have a lot
of the same power E had.
Y'all know this one?
Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel
But love me
Break my faithful heart
Tear it all apart
But love me
Won't you love me?
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh
So lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you
Dear only
I would beg and steal
Beg and steal
Just to feel
Your heart
I want your heart
Beating close to mine
So close to mine
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh
So lonely
Begging on my knees
All I ask is please
Please love me
Oh, yeah
So sweet.
Sail...
How come you didn't sing me
Love Me Tender?
You told me
that was your favorite love song.
I told you I was only gonna sing
Love Me Tender to my wife.
Sailor, baby.
You ever think something
and hear a wind
and see the Wicked Witch
of the East coming flying in?
I really did miss your mind
while I was out at Pee Dee, baby.
The rest of you, too, of course,
but the way your head works
is God's own private mystery.
What was it you was thinking?
Well, I was thinking
about smoking, actually.
My mama smokes Merits now.
It used to be she smoked Viceroys.
I started stealing them
from her about sixth grade.
When'd you start smoking, Sail?
I guess I started smoking
when I was about four.
My mom was already dead then
from lung cancer.
What brand did she smoke?
Marlboros, same as me.
I guess both my mama and my daddy died
of smoke-or alcohol-related illness.
Geez, Sail, honey, I'm sorry.
It's okay, honey.
I didn't hardly used to see them, anyways.
I didn't have much parental guidance.
The public defender kept saying that
at my parole hearing.
He was a good old boy. Stood by me.
I'd stand by you, Sail.
Through anything.
Hell, peanut,
you stuck by me
after I planted Bob Ray Lemon.
A man can't ask for more than that.
You move me, Sail.
You really do.
You mark me the deepest.
You're perfect for me, too.
You remind me of my daddy, you know.
Mama told me he liked skinny women
with breasts that stood up and said hello.
He had a long nose, too, just like yours.
Did I ever tell you how my daddy died?
In a fire, as I recall.
Yeah.
Mama told me
he poured kerosene all over himself
and lit a match.
That was a year before I met you.
No, Marietta, I haven't found them yet.
Now, why don't you just try to take it easy?
Johnnie, I'm gonna stay right here
by this telephone until you find Lula,
and then I'm gonna come get her.
So you call me the second
you get to New Orleans.
I will, honey.
Please! Don't you let me down again.
- I'll miss you.
- Get going!
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye, honey.
Well, I guess you broke parole now.
You guess?
Baby, my parole was broke 200 miles back
when we burned Portagee County.
I guess I'll send Mama
a postcard from somewhere.
I don't want her to worry
no more than necessary.
That's not why I called you here, Santos.
That don't smell like a Kool.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life.
Just tell me what you want.
Honey, you ain't gonna
begin worrying now over what's bad for you.
I mean, here you are crossing state lines
with an A-number-one certified murderer.
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer.
Don't exaggerate.
Okay. Manslaughterer, who just broke parole
and got nothing in mind
but immoral purposes,
- as far as you're concerned.
- Thank the Lord!
Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sail.
It's more than I can say
for the rest of the world.
You please me, too, peanut.
You want me to shoot Sailor
in the brains with a gun?
Yes.
In the forehead?
- Yes.
- Wrong.
It's always better to blow a hole
through the back of the head,
right through to the bridge of the nose.
Lots of irreparable brain damage.
See? I knew you had it under control.
You're a little slow,
but you're beginning to get it.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Maybe I did.
Why don't you think
of looking in New Orleans?
Lula can't stop talking about that town.
On one condition.
You give me permission
to kill Johnnie Farragut.
Santos, please!
You're not telling me
you're that sweet on him, are you?
What? No!
- Are you that sweet on him?
- No, but I can't...
'Cause one day he is gonna find out
what we are up to with Mr. Reindeer,
and he can cause us an awful lot of trouble.
I'll take your silence as a yes.
No! No! No, Santos.
- It's all right.
- You cannot kill Johnnie, no!
- It's all right.
- No, you're not gonna kill him!
- You're not gonna kill him.
- No, no, no. No.
No. Not Johnnie.
You kill Sailor.
I am going to kill Sailor.
You can be certain of that.
Hello, there, Mr. Reindeer.
This is Marcello Santos speaking.
Mr. Marcello Santos.
Hey, there!
That was great shit you sent in last month.
I got a problem.
In fact, I got a couple of problems.
Got a couple of problems, huh?
For each problem,
drop a silver dollar through my mail slot.
With all particulars.
We'll work out il conto later.
Have a beautiful day.
We are.
Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel
Oh, yeah, but love me
Keep them white panties up, baby.
We're in Jimmy Swaggart country now.
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby, please don't go
You know what?
That little bitch Susie stole my comb.
Well, fuck her. I hate that.
- I know.
- Stupid little shit.
Phone's ringing.
Juana.
A couple of silver dollars
came my way today.
I'm sending one
to you with a paper on the beneficiary.
As usual, you are completely free
to fulfill the obligation
in any manner you so desire.
In fact, send Reggie
and Dropshadow over here
for the silver dollar and the papers. Now.
They are on their way.
Who's getting that second silver dollar?
That's for me to know.
Yeah?
Thank you, Mr. Reindeer.
Have fun, darling.
How are you doing, there, boy?
Sometimes, Sail, when we're making love,
you just about take me
right over that rainbow.
You are so aware of what goes on with me.
I mean, you pay attention.
And I swear, baby,
you got the sweetest cock.
It's like it's talking to
me when you're inside,
like it's got this little
voice all its own.
And you get right on me.
You really are dangerously cute, baby.
I gotta admit it.
Let's go out
into the crazy world of New Orleans.
Go to Ronnie's
and get a fried banana sandwich.
Okay.
That's just about
the cutest thing I've ever seen.
Isn't it, though?
Yeah.
Yeah!
Pigeons spread diseases
and mess up the place. You've seen that.
Yeah!
Baby, your man done gone
Well, your man done gone
Well, your man done gone
Left the county farm
He had the shackles on
Baby, please don't go
The big N-O.
Santos, I don't know.
Well, Santos, I'm having second thoughts.
Guess what?
There's no turning back, remember?
I'm in a killing mood.
Santos, look, I...
I saw your boyfriend on Bourbon Street.
I'm not sure.
Are you in New Orleans?
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans?
Crazy fucking bitch.
Johnnie.
Ladies, what are you?
You're not just a pretty face
with a fucking smile.
You're here to make Mr. Reindeer happy
and to show him a good time.
Do not bring misfortune upon yourselves.
When I gave you the silver dollar,
I forgot to include
the contents of this envelope.
They are to be returned.
Show it just before the deed.
I fell for you, baby
Like a bomb
Now my love's gone
Up in flames
I knew I had an important lesson
to learn that day.
When she got almost to the top step,
I stuck my hand
between her legs from behind.
Baby, what a bad boy you are.
That's just what she said.
Man, I had a boner with a capital "O."
Anyway, I found her lying in a room
filled with assault weapons
and Spankhouse magazines.
So I slid my hand between her legs again
and she closed her thighs on it.
You're exciting me, honey.
Then what'd she do?
Well, her face was half-pushed
into the pillow,
and I remember she looked back
over her shoulder at me
and said, "I won't suck you.
Don't ask me to suck you."
Poor baby.
She doesn't know what she missed.
- What color hair she have?
- Jet black.
But gentlemen prefer blondes.
Anyway, dig this.
She turns over,
peels off them orange pants,
spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
Take a bite of peach.
Jesus, honey!
You more than sort of got
what you come for.
Uh-oh.
Baby, you better run me back to the hotel.
You got me hotter than Georgia asphalt.
Say no more, but go easy on me, sweetheart.
Tomorrow we got a lot of driving to do.
"Hotter than Georgia asphalt."
Be bop a lula, I don't mean maybe
Be bop a lula, she's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll
Let's rock again, now
Well, be bop a lula, she's my baby
Be bop a lula, I don't mean maybe
Be bop a lula, she's my baby
Be bop a lula, I don't mean maybe
Be bop a lula, she's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll
Wouldn't it be fabulous
if we someway stayed in love
for the rest of our lives?
You think of the weirdest damn
things to say sometimes, peanut.
Ain't we been doing
a pretty fair job thus far?
You know exactly what I mean, sugar.
It'd make the future so simple and nice.
Well, I've done a few things in my life
which I ain't too proud of.
But I'll tell you, from now on,
I ain't gonna do nothing for no good reason.
All I know for sure
is there's more than a few bad ideas
running around loose out there.
You know, there's something
I ain't never told you about, Sailor.
And this here's a story
with a lesson about bad ideas.
And what's that?
Well, my cousin Dell
was always fighting bad ideas.
See, Dell loved Christmas.
We used to call him Jingle Dell.
He wanted Christmas to last all year long.
He sure would scream out
when his mama told him it was summertime
and Christmas was six months off.
And also
he would say that he felt those men
with black rubber gloves
was following him around.
Dell said that trust and the spirit of
Christmas was destroyed by ideas
being controlled by aliens
wearing black gloves.
These aliens would get Dell
to do all kinds of things.
Then he'd carry on about the weather,
talk about how rainfall's controlled
by aliens living on Earth.
Aunt Rootie told Dell
that one day he would realize
that the alien wearing the black gloves
was him and him alone.
Well, it sounds like old Dell was more
than just a little bit confused, peanut.
Well, Dell was learning a hard lesson.
It got so he'd stay up all night
making sandwiches.
Dell, what are you doing?
I'm making my lunch!
Mama told me Aunt Rootie,
that's Dell's mama,
found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
One time, she found Dell
putting one big cockroach right on his anus.
Hell, peanut.
It ain't so funny now, though.
Dell disappeared.
Nobody's seen him since.
It's too bad he couldn't
visit that old Wizard Of Oz
and get some good advice.
Too bad we all can't, baby.
Hello?
You're there.
You're there, Johnnie.
Marietta? What's wrong, honey?
Johnnie.
Sweetheart, well,
I'm gonna tell you... Listen, honey, listen.
I want you to know something, sweetheart.
I've done something so bad.
- Real bad.
- What?
I'm not gonna tell you on the telephone, no.
I'm gonna come to New Orleans tomorrow
and I'm gonna tell you in person, okay?
Marietta, don't you do that to me, honey.
Now, you'd freak out
if I did something like that to you.
What is it?
No. I'm not gonna tell you
on the phone, okay?
But, honey,
I gotta leave right now and get on their trail.
The kids have been here.
They checked out
of the Hotel Brazil this morning.
No! Honey, stay right there.
Don't go anywhere.
I'm coming in on Piedmont
tomorrow on the 7:00 flight.
Johnnie, you and I are
going after Lula together.
All right, honey, if that's what you want.
But I'm against it.
7:00, tomorrow evening.
And, sugar,
we're gonna go have dinner
at our favorite French restaurant.
Okay? You fix it up.
Okay, bye, now.
I love you.
Marietta?
Oh, God.
How much we got left, baby?
Under 100.
You want me to drive for a stretch
so you get a chance to rest?
Yeah, that'd be good, Lula.
Come on in there, San Antonio, Texas.
What's on your almost
perfect mind this evening?
I just had triple-bypass open-heart surgery,
and I want you to know
it's people like you that made me want to...
Jesus. How can anybody listen to this crap?
...for her recent divorce,
shot and killed
her three children aged seven...
Shot right between...
A local judge praised defendant John Roy
but was dismayed to learn that
Roy had had sex with the corpse.
- What?
- Roy's lawyer was quoted as saying...
The state authorities,
last October, released 500 turtles
into the Ganges to try
and reduce human pollution
and now pIan to put in the crocodiles
to devour floating corpses...
Holy shit!
It's Night of the Living fucking Dead!
What's that, peanut?
I can't take no more of this radio.
I never heard so much shit in all my life.
Sailor Ripley, you get me some
music on that radio this instant!
I mean it!
...was victim of a sexual assault...
...mutilated, raped...
Powermad!
Johnnie, I can't.
I can't tell you now, honey. Listen.
Is there any way,
any way that we could
get out on the road tonight?
Honey, something was upsetting you bad
last night when you called.
And you wanted to tell me.
So I figured if you wanted to tell me,
that you wanted me to help you.
I did.
I did. But that was last night.
Right now, I need your help,
and we have to find Lula before it's too late.
Honey, I have to ask you something.
Okay.
Is Santos involved in this in any way?
Hell, no.
You think that I would
do something like that
without coming to talk to you first?
I'm sorry, honey.
Goddamn Pucinski, son of a bitch.
- Who, Uncle Pooch?
- Yeah, Uncle Pooch.
The son of a bitch
that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Johnnie, that's all the past.
Right now, what you and I have to do,
we have to think about our future, sugar.
Do you mean that?
You bet your sweet ass I do.
Gosh.
Did I tell you
how great it was to see you again?
Just about five times, that's all.
God, Johnnie. I love you.
I love you, too.
Johnnie, let's get our backsides
out of this town and go get my Lula.
Okay.
What's troubling you, sugar?
You know, Lula,
I never told you
what all I was doing before I met you.
Well, I just figured
you was out being Mr. Cool.
Not exactly, sugar.
One reason we're in all the trouble
we're in right now
is 'cause of what I was doing.
I tried to tell you this before.
You're scaring me, baby.
Well, there's a good side
as well as a bad side to it.
And the good side is I knew your daddy
and I thought Clyde was a good old guy.
- You knew my daddy?
- Yes, I did.
I sure did.
The bad side of it is I did some driving
for a man named Marcello Santos.
Shit.
I quit working for him, but just before I did,
I ended up one night at a house.
I didn't know it then, but it was your house.
I don't know what it is
they all think I saw that night,
but I was just sitting out in the car
till the whole place went up in flames.
Oh, God, Sailor.
That's the night my sweet daddy died.
I know, sugar.
Daddy?
That's some big secret
you been carrying, Sail.
We all got a secret side, baby.
Hope you don't think
I've been lying to you about other things.
Lula, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
Are you upset with me?
It's just shocking sometimes
when things aren't the way
you thought they were.
Well, we're really out
in the middle of it now, ain't we?
I'm gonna pack real fast,
and then I'm gonna meet you downstairs.
Oh, my God, what we could've
done in that king-size bed tonight.
Don't you worry, honey.
I'm gonna make up for it.
All right.
- See you in just a minute.
- Okay.
Marietta?
What's that?
I don't know. It looks like clothes.
Oh, God, Sailor.
One bad car accident.
Sailor!
What are we gonna do?
I don't know, honey,
but we gotta help that girl.
Get her to a town
and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
I got a bobby pin.
There's a bobby pin.
I can't find it.
My mother's gonna kill me. It's got...
It's got all my cards in it,
and it was in my pocket,
and now my pocket's gone.
You gotta help me find it.
My mother's gonna kill me.
It's got all my cards in it,
and it was in my pocket.
It was... It was in my pocket.
My purse is gone!
My purse is gone! Now she tells me!
Now she fucking tells me!
Let's get a hold of her quick.
You think she's gonna make it?
Don't know,
but she's gonna bleed all over our car,
I'll tell you that. Hey!
Hello. Girl!
You gotta come with us, honey.
Leave me alone!
Robert!
Shit.
Got this damn sticky stuff in my hair.
Got this sticky stuff in my hair.
You better come with us, honey.
- Come on.
- I gotta find my wallet.
Don't say one word of this
to my mother, please. Please.
God, she's gonna kill me.
You can't worry about that. You got...
Oh, God!
Where's my hairbrush?
God, she's dying right in front of us, Sailor.
Get my lipstick.
It's in my purse.
She died right in front of us, Sailor.
Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
Let's get out of here, honey.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Oh, God!
Come on.
Oh, God!
I don't understand this, not just one tiny bit.
See, he told me to come down here
to wait for him in that lobby there,
that he'd meet me in the lobby.
And what I feel is just that something
terrible has happened to him.
Well, perhaps we should
call a local law enforcement officer.
No! No, please. Please, please, no.
See, the last thing I need
is some damn policeman
just moving the hell
and a-going around here,
and I just can't...
No, no. Please, no.
I'm sorry. I must have overlooked this.
I'm truly sorry, madam.
What?
Could you... Could...
"Gone fishing with a friend.
"And maybe buffalo hunting, too."
Buffalo hunting?
"I've gone buffalo hunting"?
What the fuck does that mean?
Buffalo hunting.
I'm sure I wouldn't know. I mean...
Oh, my God.
He's afraid.
He's done it again!
The fucker split!
"I made a commitment."
Marietta.
Santos!
Gentlemen, I'd like to
take this opportunity to ask you,
please, clear out.
How rude!
- Me, too?
- Yeah, you, too.
What'd you do to Johnnie?
Where's Johnnie?
I want to know what's happening here!
- Hey...
- Would you tell me what's happening?
Santos, you tell me what's happening here.
You been crying?
You gotta cut out
this crybaby stuff, you know.
You're my girl now.
And Santos... Santos...
Santos wants to wipe away the tears.
Make you happy. Hey.
I want you to tell me something.
I want you to tell me,
did you do anything to Johnnie?
Did you hurt him? I want to know.
I did not do anything to Johnnie Farragut.
You swear? On your mother?
I swear. On my mother.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Now, come on, we got to go.
I got word.
Kids are moving through Texas,
and I think a happy ending
is being arranged there.
That's it. Give me a smile.
Santos. Santos...
You're the only one
that always came through for me.
I smell your shit now, Johnnie.
Give us one more kiss, Reggie!
Fuck me!
Fuck me.
Fuck me!
We hunt buffalo now.
Can't wait no more.
Remember the number
ten.
I can't stop her, Johnnie.
But I'm gonna be standing right behind you
with this big old gun here.
It's a Marine issue.
I go out now.
- Reggie!
- Yeah.
Show him now.
Johnnie.
I forget to show you this.
Santos?
Oh, God, Marietta, honey.
- One.
- Bye, now.
Two.
Three. Four.
Getting too fucking hot now, Reggie.
Five.
Feeling myself.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Fuck me now, Reggie!
Ten.
Why in the hell
do you want to come to Big Tuna, Sail?
Well, I know it ain't exactly Emerald City.
It ain't as bad as the weather, though.
It's an awful long way off
that road to California.
Why in the hell
do you want to come here, baby?
Well! Look at this.
So, what do you want, Mr. Snakeskin?
I was hoping you could tell me
if there's a contract out on me.
I really need to know.
- By who?
- Santos.
Or Marietta Fortune.
I heard you were going
with that bitch's daughter.
You heard right.
You are one big, stupid asshole.
Don't you know that her mommy
and Santos killed her daddy?
So maybe one night
you got too close to a fire.
So maybe you're gonna burn.
- I didn't see nothing.
- Sure. I did.
Santos.
Is there a contract?
We had a deal once.
We'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
I know.
I remember.
Well?
I heard of nothing.
Thanks.
Sail, honey, is that you?
The one and only.
Did you get that oil, baby?
Yes, sirree.
I met a guy named Red, owns a garage.
What's that smell?
I barfed.
Tried to make it to the bathroom.
Turned out to be the wrong door, anyways.
I think all this driving's upsetting me, baby.
Do you think we could stay
and rest here a couple of days?
Are you carsick, sweetheart?
A little. I guess.
Sail, honey.
I hope seeing that girl die didn't jinx us.
I got this for you.
It has 40 different flavors.
One for pretty near every reason I love you.
Sail, I'm gonna save this.
But if I ever eat it,
I'll be thinking of you.
"Robert Brenton and two passengers,
"William Reese and Julie Day, were killed
"when his car went off the road
on Highway 118."
Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck!
That stupid shit!
That fucking Bob was so fucking dumb,
he deserved to die!
That asshole!
Hey, Timmy, what's going on
over there in number four
where all them bright lights are all the time?
Them are making a pornographic movie.
Texas style. You wanna join in?
One thing about surviving in Big Tuna,
you got to have an active sense of humor.
- How you doing?
- Hey, Rex.
This here is Bose Spool.
We call him 00 Spool.
Man there's a rocket scientist.
My dog barks some.
Mentally, you picture my dog.
But I have not told you
the type of dog which I have.
Perhaps you might even picture Toto
from The Wizard of Oz.
But I can tell you
my dog is always with me.
Hey, everybody.
- Bobby.
- Hey, Bobby.
Hey, Sailor, Lula,
this here is the man himself.
Bobby, this is Sailor and Lula,
the two most recent strandees,
economic variety.
Bobby Peru. Just like the country.
Bobby just rolled into town
a couple days ago.
Yeah, Bobby here
is the most exciting item to hit Big Tuna
since the '86 cyclone
sheared the roof off the high school.
You from Texas, Mr. Peru?
I'm from all over.
I see you was in the Marines.
Four years.
Bobby was at Cao Bang.
What's Cao Bang?
How old are you?
Twenty.
Whole lot of women, kids,
and old people died at Cao Bang.
You was on a ship, partner.
Pretty hard to make contact with the people
when you're out floating
in the fucking Gulf of Tonkin.
Come on, Bobby.
Have yourself another glass of Jack. Okay?
Don't mind if I fucking do.
Speaking of Jack,
One-eyed Jack's yearning to go
a-peeping in a seafood store.
All right.
Nice meeting you.
- Adios, boys.
- See you, Bobby.
Bobby's got a way.
Can't shake that institution odor.
Baby, I still ain't feeling so well.
I'm going to bed. Will you come with me?
Yeah. I'll come along.
Well, good night.
- Good night.
- Night.
Lordy, what was that all about?
I don't know.
Man, that barf smell don't fade fast.
Is there anything I can do for you?
I don't think so, Sail.
I just need to lie down.
Sail, you know what?
I know you ain't
particularly pleased being here.
Not that.
I'm gonna write it down,
'cause I can't say it.
You can't say it?
I can't say this. Not out loud.
Oh, God.
It's okay by me, peanut.
Well, nothing personal,
but I ain't so sure it's okay by me.
Really, Sail,
it ain't nothing against you, baby.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I know.
I'm just sort of uncomfortable
about how things has been going.
Seems we sort of broke down
along that yellow brick road,
and this don't help soothe me.
Honey, I promise I ain't gonna
let things get no worse.
Not in a million years.
Yeah.
Hey, pretty woman.
Is Sailor here?
He's changing the oil out in our car.
Man, I got to take a piss bad.
Can I use your head?
Yeah, I guess.
I don't mean your head-head.
I'm not gonna piss
on your head, your hair and all.
Just gonna piss in the toilet.
Y'all take a listen.
You'll hear a deep sound
coming down from Bobby Peru.
You got the smell in this room of puke.
You been puking, little girl?
Huh?
You sick?
Pregnant?
You used the toilet, now you can go.
It ain't none of your business
what I do around here, that's for sure.
You know, I sure do like a
woman with nice tits like yours,
who talks tough and looks like
she can fuck like a bunny.
Can you fuck like that, huh?
You like it like a bunny?
'Cause if you do, baby,
I'll fuck you good.
Like a big old jackrabbit bunny,
jump all around that hole.
Bobby Peru don't come up for air.
Get out.
Am I scaring you?
Your pussy wet?
Is it wet?
Don't jump back so slow.
I thought you was a bunny. Bunny jump fast.
You jump back slow.
Means something, don't it?
It means something to me.
It means you want Bobby Peru.
You want Bobby Peru
to fuck you hard, baby,
open you like a Christmas present.
You want me to do it?
Just a simple yes or no.
Just feel me breathing on you.
And you know I mean business
when it comes to fucking.
Get out!
Bobby Peru grab you,
hold you tight,
feel everything inside you. Be quiet.
Say "Fuck me." And I'll leave.
- No way. Get out!
- Say it!
I'll tear your fucking heart out, girl!
Say "Fuck me."
Say "Fuck me" and then I'll leave.
Say "Fuck me." Whisper it.
Say it.
Say "Fuck me."
Whisper it. "Fuck me."
"Fuck me."
Say it. "Fuck me."
"Fuck me."
Fuck me.
Someday, honey, I will.
But I gotta get going.
Sing. Don't cry.
Sail.
Hey, Bobby.
Need a hand?
No thanks, Bobby. About done.
How about a beer?
Beer...
Well...
Yeah, Bobby, that'd be fine.
Where's that pretty little lady
of yours today?
She's up in our room resting.
Hasn't been feeling well lately.
Sorry to hear it.
Sailor.
I've been studying a situation over in Lobo.
Take two men to handle it.
What's that?
Feed store keeps up to 5K in their safe.
Need me a good boy for backup. Even split.
You interested?
No, man.
I don't think so.
Be easy, Sailor.
There's two employees,
I take them in the back to open the safe,
and you just keep the door covered.
You ain't planning
on raising a family in the Big Tuna, are you?
Wait a minute.
What do... What do you mean by "family"?
Well, I mean, like Lula
being in the family way and all.
Lula tell you that she's pregnant?
Couple of grand or two
sure would give you two a leg up,
get you out to the West Coast, Mexico,
just about anyplace
with a couple of dollars in your jeans.
I got it figured good, Sailor.
When did you talk to Lula?
I talked to her this afternoon.
When you was out.
Did she really...
Did she really say she was pregnant?
I just took a guess, that's all.
You in or out on this deal?
I ain't fucking sure, Bobby.
Don't take too long to think about it.
Had enough?
I have now.
Come on. Come on, let's go outside.
I got something to show you.
Right here is a double-barrel
sawed-off Ithaca shotgun.
Next to it we got a cold Smith & Wesson
.38 handgun with a four-inch barrel.
Those'll do her.
Really loosen up that five grand.
Two and a half for you and the little lady.
How much money you got
between the two of you?
Forty bucks.
This is easy money, partner.
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt in this thing.
And I don't think
you can afford to pass it up.
I'll be bringing the Eldo
round the back of the motel
at 10:00 in the morning.
Really could set you
and that little lady up good.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
That kind of money...
Get us a long way
down that yellow brick road.
But God damn it, Bobby,
this better go real smooth.
You understand me?
Like taking candy from a fucking baby.
Here comes Sailor.
You been drinking, huh?
A few beers, is all.
Feeling any better?
Can't tell yet.
That smell's still filling this room good.
So where'd you say you was?
I went with Bobby.
Sail.
Mmm-hmm?
Let's leave here.
We're going to, peanut.
Real soon.
You up to something
with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
What could I be up to, Lula?
That Bobby Peru's a black angel, Sail.
You hook up with him, and you'll regret it.
If you live to.
Thanks, darling.
I know you got my best interests in mind.
I appreciate it sincerely.
I love you, but I got to get some sleep now.
This whole world's
wild at heart and weird on top.
I wish you'd sing me Love Me Tender.
I wish I was somewhere over the rainbow.
It's just shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
The whole gang, huh?
Yup.
You know, you look
a whole lot better in the flesh.
The cobra's ready to strike, chica.
You know that guy, Sailor?
He came by the other afternoon.
He wanted to know
if there was a contract on him.
No shit?
- You know him?
- I used to.
- What'd you say?
- No, of course.
That's right.
Could have a bad accident, though.
Before, during, or after a holdup.
What am I doing here?
Sailor, what are you doing here, man?
I can't do this.
Climb in back.
What the hell is she doing here, man?
She's my girl. She's driving.
That bother you?
Come on, jump in. You owe me one.
Come on, Mr. Big Round Balls.
Let's go and make us some easy money.
Yeah.
They say the eagle flies on Friday.
Get that mask on!
Keep it revving, chiquita. We'll be right back.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.
Remember that.
That's right, partner.
All right!
Morning, farmboys. In the back.
Get in the back, now! Both of you!
Anyone comes in,
herd them back here quick.
All right! All right, now, boys.
Let's make this nice and easy.
Come on, come on!
Keep your hands up high.
Keep your hands up high.
Are you waiting for somebody, miss?
He's in the feed store
picking up some supplies.
- Uh-huh?
- Mmm-hmm.
Well, you best be watching
that cigarette, ma'am.
It's just about to burn down
between your fingers.
Gracias, Officer.
I haven't seen you before.
You from here in Lobo?
No.
Over there, now!
- Big Tuna, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, that's quite a little drive, isn't it?
- Yup.
Let's go!
Say cheese.
Bobby!
Stay put. Don't move.
Cool it, man!
You're next, fucker.
Those are dummies, dummy.
Okay.
Why don't you step up here, hot shot?
I'll slap that smile right off your face.
Okay.
Stop, you sons of bitches!
This is the police! Hold it, or I'll shoot!
For Christ's sakes.
That poor bastard.
Hey! Put your hands
behind your head, cowboy.
Lula, I really let you down this time.
Peanut!
Look for the damn thing!
You gotta get that thing sewed back on.
They sew them things back on.
Works good as new.
I can't find it. Where is the damn thing?
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
Sailor!
Pardon me, I'm looking for 770378.
Sailor, baby.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God. My baby.
Sweetest one.
Sweetheart.
Mommy's gonna take you home.
You're gonna go home.
Santos is gonna help us.
He's gonna take us
to the airport in San Antonio.
It's okay, baby.
- No.
- Yes.
Come. We're gonna go. Yes, okay.
- Mama?
- Yes.
Sailor is in deep trouble here.
I can't just leave him.
Yes, you can!
Yes, you can.
Yes. Yes.
Your mama was real worried
about you, honey.
Me, too.
Can you give your old friend Santos a hug?
Oh, my God.
Dearest Sailor, darling,
the first thing you'll want to know is
I'm keeping the baby.
Mama wasn't for it in the beginning,
but I think she's looking forward to it.
I'm gonna name it Pace,
no matter if it's a boy or a girl.
It's kind of hard to believe that
Pace will be six years old when you get out.
Our child.
I love you, Sailor.
I miss dancing and talking.
And especially the other.
What time does Sailor's train get in?
6:00.
- Lula.
- Hmm?
If I asked you not to go?
It wouldn't make any difference.
Girl! What if I told you not to go?
Mama, if you get in the way
of me and Sailor's happiness,
I'll fucking pull your arms out by the roots!
No!
- Shit!
- Mama! You almost crashed us!
An accident, baby.
Hide.
Oh, no! Oh, man!
Hey, man! Same fucking thing
happened to me last year.
Lula.
Sailor.
You must be my son.
Shake hands with your daddy, Pace.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Pace.
I read a lot about you.
You hungry?
Lead the way.
No!
No! No! No!
What's wrong, Mama?
Don't worry, son. Just stay here.
I'm sorry, Sailor.
I just can't help it.
If you just give me one little minute, I'll quit.
The boy's frightened, Lula.
This ain't no good.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on.
I'll walk back to the depot.
What are you talking about?
That's your son in there.
He ain't never known me, Lula,
so there's not much for him to forget.
And not seeing each other for six years
makes it next best to simple for us, too.
How can you say this, Sail?
It's what makes sense, is all.
Hell, baby.
Please don't do this, Sail.
If ever something don't feel right to you,
remember what Pancho said
to the Cisco Kid.
"Let's went, before we're dancing
at the end of a rope without music."
No.
You've been doing fine without me, peanut.
There's no need to make life
tougher than it has to be.
Sailor.
Sailor, come back!
Sailor!
What do you faggots want?
Sailor.
Sailor?
The Good Witch.
Sailor Ripley, Lula loves you.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer.
And I haven't had any parental guidance.
She's forgiven you all these things.
You love her.
Don't be afraid, Sailor.
But I'm wild at heart.
If you're truly wild at heart,
you'll fight for your dreams.
Don't turn away from love, Sailor.
Don't turn away from love.
Had enough, asshole?
Yes, I have.
And I want to apologize to you gentlemen
for referring to you as homosexuals.
I also want to thank you fellas.
You've taught me a valuable lesson in life.
Lula!
Lula!
Lula!
Sailor!
Lula.
Baby. Baby!
Sailor.
I just met the Good Witch.
Love me tender
Sailor!
Love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For, my darling, I love you
And I always will
Love me tender
Love me long
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For, my darling, I love you
And I always will
Love me tender
Love me dear
Tell me you are mine
I'll be yours through all the years
Till the end of time
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For, my darling, I love you
And I always will
