I'm gonna say our mantra,
"This is the voice I want to use"...
...over and over again,
but with different inflections.
And I want you to try and mimic
what I'm doing.
This is the voice I want to use.
This is the voice I want to use.
Now, I'm gonna press down
on our tongue and watch...
...what's happening
in the back of our mouths. Ready?
- Any suicidal tendencies?
- No.
- Have you ever felt as though
you were being followed? - No.
- Any history
of family mental illness? - No.
Medical procedures to date?
The usual electrolysis,
3 years of hormone therapy...
...facial feminization surgery,
a brow lift, forehead reduction...
...jaw re-contouring,
and a tracheal shave.
You look very authentic.
I try to blend in,
keep a low profile.
I believe the slang terminology
is "living stealth".
- Do you consider yourself
a happy person? - Yes.
I mean, no.
I mean... I will be.
Miss Osborne, there's no such thing
as a right answer in this office.
Yes. I'm a very happy person.
How can I help you
if you won't be honest with me?
You can sign that consent form.
Please.
The American Psychiatric Association
categorizes gender dysphoria...
...as a very serious mental disorder.
After my operation not even a
gynecologist will be able to detect...
...anything out of the ordinary
about my body.
I will be a woman.
Don't you find it odd that plastic
surgery can cure a mental disorder?
How do you feel about your penis?
It disgusts me.
I don't even like looking at it.
- What about friends?
- They don't like it either.
No. I mean, do you have
the support of friends?
I'm very close to my therapist.
What about your family?
My family is dead.
#You take some hormones,
and I'll take some hormones. #
#I'II be a woman
before you. #
#You make me happy when... #
Shit!
I mean darn. Darn it. Darn it.
Darn it. Darn it. Darn it.
Good night, Bree.
Sleep tight, Bree.
¡Olé!
This is the voice. Hi.
This is the voice.
Hello. May I please speak to Mr.
Or Mrs. Bhumibol Niratpattanasai?
Mrs. Niratpattanasai,
this is Bree Osborne calling...
...with a special introductory offer
from the National Home Shopping...
Hello?
Stanley Schupak doesn't live
here anymore. Who's calling?
Stanley doesn't have a son.
You must have the wrong number.
How old are you?
Why don't you call your mother?
Hello. May I please speak
to Mr. Jamal Niang?
Mr. Niang, it's Bree Osborne calling
from the National Home Shopping Club...
...with a special introductory rate
of only $19.90... Hello?
- He signed it.
- I am so proud of you!
Two signatures. I hereby
pronounce you officially legal...
...to undergo
sexual reassignment surgery.
Thank you.
I... I just...
Thank you.
So, what else is new?
I made my sales quota for the month
on Tuesday.
That pink lamb's wool cardigan
that I ordered arrived.
Oh, and this is odd.
I got a phone call last night...
...from a juvenile inmate
of the New York prison system.
- He claimed to be Stanley's son.
- No third person.
My son.
I thought you told me
that you were a virgin.
There was this one girl in college.
But the whole thing was so...
...tragically lesbian
that I didn't think it counted.
Wow!
- A son!
- An alleged son.
He's probably
just some sort of scam artist.
What's he scamming you for?
I guess we'll never know.
Nothing is gonna stop me from
checking into that hospital next week.
I'm not gonna get dragged back
into Stanley's old life.
Stanley's life is your life!
- Why don't you get in touch
with the mother? - She's dead.
Anyway, he's a teen. He's old enough
to take care of himself.
Bree, this is a part of your body
that cannot be discarded.
I don't want you to go
through this metamorphosis...
...only to find out
you're still incomplete.
What if I...
...visit him later...
after my surgery, after I've...
...settled into my new life?
When you're ready.
What are you doing?
I can't give this
to your surgeon right now.
Yes, you can.
I can't miss my surgery on Friday.
They're booked up a year in advance.
I'II wire bail money to New York.
I'II call a social worker
and have someone check in on him.
- What do you want me to do?
- Bree...
...honey, I just want you to be ready.
Hello? May I please have
the number of the New York City...
...downtown lock-up?
- Mr. Schupak? - Ms. Schupak.
I mean, Ms. Osborne. I changed it.
Can I ask what your relationship is
to the prisoner?
Allegedly I'm his...
Allegedly he's... my son.
This is a new one. According to this,
he shoplifted a frog!
Plus we have testimony that he was
in possession of a small amount...
...of a suspicious-looking
white powder.
Although emergency services was unable
to recover the evidence.
Drugs? Is he an addict?
Most of them are.
Most of whom are?
Are you aware that your son's
been hustling on the streets...
...working as a prostitute?
- How much is the bail?
- Bail's set at 1 dollar.
I can't possibly afford...
1 dollar?
Sabrina Claire Osborne!
Meet Toby Wilkins.
My friends call me Bree.
Jesus the Reformer?
That's one of these churches
sending missionaries out...
...to guide street people back to God.
- No.
I'm...
...from the Church
of the Potential Father.
Oh, yes.
Dear God, bless this food,
and bless this restaurant...
...and all the people in it,
and everyone else... everywhere.
Sic transit gloria mundi,
in excelsis Deo. Amen.
Do you have any percs?
Vicodin? Anything with codeine?
Sorry, I'm all out.
So why don't you tell me
something about yourself?
I'm not naming any names.
I said about yourself!
Is Toby short for something?
- A diminutive?
- No, it's American.
Where do you come from?
- Callicoon.
- Where's Callicoon?
In Kentucky. Duh.
Is that where your family is?
My mother's dead.
She had a stroke.
Is there anyone else?
- I had a stepfather.
- That's wonderful!
Me and him don't get along.
- Why not?
- T.M.I.
Too much information.
What about grandparents?
Aunts? Uncles?
I don't need any family.
I can take care of myself.
I'm a Ioner.
That's wonderful.
That's the spirit.
I've been meaning to thank you
for bailing me out.
You're welcome.
I decided in jail, I'm going
to give up hustling.
- It's degradable.
- Degrading.
- How many... people inhabit...
this place? - 3.
By the way, I was just holding those
drugs for a friend. I'm not stupid.
Junkies just live for the day,
no ambition or anything.
- You have ambition?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna get a career
in the movies.
10... 20... 40.
60... 80... 100.
Here.
- Will it hold you for a while?
- Yeah. Dude, this is great.
I wish you'd stop calling me "dude"!
Well, I best be on my way.
I've got a flight to Los Angeles
early in the morning.
Maybe I'll see you out there. That's
where they make the movies, right?
I'm gonna hitchhike out there,
like... tomorrow.
You can't.
You don't wanna add jumping bail
to your permanent record.
I'II change my street name.
Something like Stanley. Stan.
Stan the Man.
That's my dad's name.
There's his picture.
He's with my mom.
Are you okay?
I'm a little dizzy.
Beverly Hills is close
to the ocean, right?
Maybe I'll learn how to surf.
Dye my hair blonde for the movies.
They love blonds there. "Blond
in Blond", "Stocks and Blonds"...
..."Bodacious Blond Bottoms".
Not that I'm a bottom or anything.
Are you talking
about pornographic films?
Duh.
Is there a...
...ladies room
in this establishment?
- Hello? - Margaret, it's Bree.
I'm in New York.
It turns out this whole jail episode
was just a big mistake.
Talk to me!
He's a thoroughly
independent young man!
We're getting along famously.
He's going to come visit me
after my surgery and...
...I promised to take him
to Disneyland. - I see.
So I thought I'd take an early flight
back tomorrow. Get back to work.
Recoup some of the money I spent on
this trip before my surgery next week.
How are you?
Right now I'm a little disappointed
because you're lying to me.
Is there anything else
you'd like to say?
There appears to be a step-father.
Perhaps I can effect a reunion.
Have you ever heard of a place
called Callicoon?
I just conferred with my immediate
superior at The Church.
She feels that getting you away
from this unwholesome environment...
...is my moral duty.
Free ride, free food,
free motel rooms, all the way to L.A.
Uh-uh. Nothing's free.
You're gonna end up marrying her
and spending all your life...
...eating out
cobwebby old stank Christian pussy.
Something for the road, my man?
The finest Tecate!
Fuck no, man.
I'm giving that shit up.
Come on, it's only 5 dollars a bag
over street price!
Convenience charge!
We could take it out of your cut
if she buys the car.
Fuck you, dude.
Alright.
- Whatever! You're the man!
- No. Wait. Hey.
I'm not marrying you.
Glory hallelujah!
Almost a new fan belt.
I changed the oil 2 months ago,
only 230,000 miles.
It just needs a little paint.
That's all. It runs perfect.
- Guaranteed.
- I've already arranged a rental.
But, when you get to California,
you could resell it, make a profit.
A profit?
- Fasten your seat belt.
- I don't like wearing them.
Well, I don't like the idea
of seeing your internal organs...
...splattered all over the dashboard
in case we get in a wreck, God forbid.
- So put it on.
- See this shirt?
It cost me 2 dollars.
- Quelle surprise! - These shoes?
3 dollars, 1.50 each.
- You know how much these things
are worth in Japan? - 3 dollars?
Like, 500 dollars. Japanese people
will kill for old Nikes.
Then you probably should avoid
wearing them in Japan.
Yeah. I'd probably be
like disemboweled by a ninja.
You don't have to say "like".
"Probably disemboweled by a ninja"
is sufficient.
And, please, don't put your feet
up on the dashboard.
No smoking in the car.
I thought instead of going west
on Route 95...
...we'd wind through the mountains
on Route 20.
Route 20 takes us
close to Callicoon.
I don't wanna go there.
What I find absolutely
beyond comprehension...
...is how a person
can perform all those...
...intimate acts
with just any stranger off the street.
Why should you give a shit?
Because it's
the Christian thing to do.
How much money did you make per...
...assignation?
- $40 or $50.
- Are we gonna be going through Texas?
- Pretty hard to avoid it!
Do you have any money
for some food?
I'm sorry
I can't offer you a private room.
The church has to conserve
its resources.
I've charted us a course
on the nice, little red roads.
Callicoon is only about 45 minutes
out of our way.
I don't wanna go there.
These are nice beds!
Don't you have any pajamas?
- No.
- Well...
...you should get some.
Good night.
Rise and shine!
Up, up, up!
We've got a schedule to keep.
Did I put on too much blush?
You're weird.
The first place I lived was like
a hole in the wall off Avenue C.
I had, like, 4 roommates.
One was...
...a junkie, one was a crackhead...
...one was like a junkie,
and the other one was...
...like a junkie.
- Like, like, like!
Did you know that
the Lord of the Rings is gay?
I beg your pardon?
There's this big black tower, right?
And it points right at this...
...huge burning vagina thing. And it's
like the symbol of ultimate evil.
And then Sam and Frodo
have to go into this cave...
...and deposit their magic ring
into this hot steaming lava pit.
Only at the last minute...
...Frodo can't perform,
so Gollum bites off his finger.
Gay.
What the fuck are you looking at?
I just didn't think it was right...
...to come so close to Callicoon
without at least passing through.
Toby!
Where are you going?
You're acting like a spoiled child!
Oh, my God! I can't believe my eyes!
It's my sweet little angel baby!
Give me another hug!
I could wring your neck
like a chicken! My favorite boy!
And not even a phone call to tell me
if you're alive or dead!
- I was never your favorite.
- That's what you think.
I used to look at him out that window,
playing all day with that big dog.
- Toby lived near here?
- Just 2 doors up the road!
So, what've you been doing with
yourself? I wanna know everything.
He's been in New York...
...working toward developing a career
in the film industry.
- I'm going to California.
- California?!
He always was the artistic type!
He used to have
this precious stuffed monkey...
...he carried around with him
everywhere, even to school!
- Are you in the movie business too?
- She's a missionary with the church.
Praise the Lord!
I'm an electrolygist myself.
If you want, I can get those little
hairs up under your nose for you!
My boss lady down at the salon
used to work out in California.
From what I hear,
some of the Hollywood beauties...
...used to be as hairy as hogs.
That ought to keep them
from sticking their heads up again!
Thank you.
You ought to go
and say hello to your step-daddy!
- I don't wanna see him.
- Of course you do.
The man raised you, clothed you,
fed you, sheltered you from harm.
He's your father...
...for all practical purposes.
He always was a sensitive thing.
Are you going to drive him
all the way to California?
I have to get some air.
Excuse me. And thank you.
- Yeah?
- Good evening.
- Do you per chance know
a Toby Wilkins? - Who's asking?
I am a bearer of glad tidings.
Your son has come home!
Good!
Toby! Arletty!
I brought back a surprise.
Come on in.
Look who's here!
If you can't bring Mohamed
to the mountain...
...bring the mountain to Mohamed!
Look how much you've grown!
Toby, give your father a hug!
I was worried sick about you.
Why'd you run off like that?
- I missed you.
- Isn't this sweet?
I know what you missed.
You missed my mouth, my ass.
You hush now.
What are these ladies gonna think?
You wanna fuck me
in front of them?
You shut up!
Bobby!
Was that good for you?
Come on, Bobby.
You liked it.
- You liked in the...
- Shut up!
Come on!
Toby...
Honey...
This man's heavy with sin.
Put him in that chair there.
I don't know you, Bobby Jensen.
He'll come to in a couple of hours.
This isn't my fault!
You never told me
why you didn't wanna come home.
Where are you going?
I brought you some breakfast...
He's walking down to the highway ramp
to hitchhike himself a ride.
He's a disappearing act.
It's the same thing he did
after his mama killed herself.
She what?
She shut herself up in the garage
with the car on.
Toby found her there
when he came home from school.
Oh, God!
Lovely scenery
in this part of the country.
I took a ride from you, I never said
I'd carry on a fucking conversation.
I was just trying
to do you a favor!
Considering the way you've been living
your life it wasn't unreasonable...
...to try to put you
under some parental supervision.
What's that? Is that drugs?
Oh, no! Absolutely not!
God damn it!
No! That is not alright!
You can't do that here! No!
Are you gonna let me do my thing
or do I have to get out right now?
Go ahead.
Kill yourself.
What does it matter to me?
One chocolate milkshake for you
and coffee for your mother.
I'm not his mother.
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
Let's look for a motel.
I'm camping out.
Do you have something
a trifle less...
...butch?
Fettuccine Alfredo
or Chicken Cordon Bleu?
Chicken.
Matches?
Fuck!
Excuse me.
I have to go to the ladies room.
Do you think
there are snakes around here?
Get away, snakes!
Where did you get that?
I had it.
What is that awful sound?
It's a loon.
Certain Native American tribes
of the northern plains...
...believed loons were
ancestral spirits...
...trying to communicate
with the physical world.
My real dad's part Indian.
Is he?
Yeah. He never told me,
but I just know.
It's an Indian thing.
Do you think you could find it in your
heart to offer a sip of it to a lady?
Are you sick or something?
I'm fine.
These are vitamins.
When I was a little girl...
...I had a terry cloth bunny.
I used to sleep with her every night.
Try holding your breath.
Then one day my parents decided
I was too old for her...
...and I never saw her again.
I found him...
...in your step-father's garage.
Here...
Rise and shine!
Come on! Let's go!
I've got to be in L.A.
By the end of the week.
What would you say if I told you
I could set you up with a job...
...in the telemarketing field?
The nice thing about telemarketing is
you can live any place.
I could drop you off in... Austin.
I'm going to California. My real dad
has a mansion there with a pool.
What do you see your life like,
10 years from now?
Probably get a job at a pet store.
Have a dog, maybe some kids.
Kids!
I always wanted kids.
Perhaps you ought to aim
for something a little...
...higher than working in a pet store.
If you like animals, you could become
a veterinarian or a zoologist.
- I'm out of cigarettes.
- Quel dommage!
What does
"quel dommage" mean?
It means you're not getting
any cigarettes.
Are you a boy or a girl?
Turn around
and stop bothering people!
Margaret! Thank God!
I am in the middle of Arkansas...
...and an 8-year-old child
just read me! I can't handle this!
I had to camp out last night
on the ground with bugs!
He is impossible.
I can't throw away all my savings!
My surgery's only 5 days away.
Dallas? I don't know.
4 or 5 hours. Why?
Hold on.
Toby!
Would you mind introducing me
to your new friend?
Taylor.
Yeah, this is Taylor.
It's nice to meet you, Taylor.
What's going on here?
Come on! Your mother's waiting
for you in the car!
You better watch out he doesn't get
some poor innocent girl in trouble.
You better watch out she doesn't ruin
some poor innocent boy's life!
You, go wait for me at the table!
Margaret! I really don't think
I am cut out to be a mother.
Dear God, bless this meal...
...and please help Toby to find the
strength not to take any more drugs...
...so that in L.A. He can get a job
and find a nice apartment.
So that even if he never finds
his real father...
...he can lead an independent life.
Amen.
Amen.
There's a really cool hat back there.
It's only $10.
My nose is getting sunburned...
Eat your vegetables.
You might wanna use a fork.
Just an idea.
I'II tell you what.
You can have that hat
on one condition: No more drugs.
I mean it.
Deal?
Deal.
I got you a present.
Thank you. I'm very... touched.
Put it on!
That looks good.
You get back in here!
Do you have any idea
how dangerous that is?! In! In! In!
Okay!
- Get in! - I was holding on.
You wanna give me a heart attack?
Did I scare you?
Why are we going to Dallas?
An associate of mine has arranged
a place for us to stay for the night.
This Mary Ellen is being very generous
to offer us her hospitality, so...
...I hope you'll be
on your best behavior.
I'm always on my best behavior.
Sabrina and Toby, right?
I'm Mary Ellen. Come on in!
I'm having a little get-together, but
you two just make yourselves at home!
Mary Ellen, come here!
Alicia's showing us her new vagina!
I'm sorry.
They're feeling a little feisty.
Everybody, this is Sabrina,
and her handsome escort here is Toby.
- Hi!
- Hi yo!
Margaret said you were stealth!
I am, in public.
This is the privacy of my own home!
Welcome to the first meeting
of the Gender Pride President's Day...
...Weekend Caribbean Cruise
Planning Committee!
- We have to go.
- No!
Where you guys
know each other from?
We don't. She's a friend
of a friend of a friend...
There's rum punch in the kitchen
and guacamole in the dining room!
- Come on!
- Don't be so uptight. It's a party!
Margaret told me you were planning
to have your surgery soon.
Toby doesn't know about me.
You're stealth to him?!
- Oh, sugar dumpling! - Don't worry,
honey, we've all been there.
I'II pass the word.
It was one of those
instant best friend things.
But at the time we were both straight
men. What could you do with that?
We had our surgery on the same day.
We ended up holding hands
in the recovery room.
And now this gorgeous creature
is the love of my life.
We were telling you friend a bit
about the transsexual lifestyle.
Not what you're used to
in church, huh?
These are vaginal dilators.
She just had her surgery last month.
- This is Keanu 2. And this is
Keanu 3. - Where's Keanu 1?
Keanu 1 is in Hollywood filming
a major science fiction epic...
...and we don't wanna hear
a snarky remark about him.
We're not gender-challenged.
We're gender-gifted.
I've been woman and I've been man,
and I know more things...
...than you single-sexed people
can even imagine.
Dude, I thought you were a real guy.
We walk among you.
That poor thing couldn't pass
on a dark night at 200 yards.
In the pink.
You better check your T-dar, honey.
She's a G. G!
- A what?
- A genuine girl... from Mary Kay!
If you let her do a color trial,
she'II give you a free compact.
#Give me a home
where the buffalo roam... #
#... and the deer
and the antelope play... #
#... with each other. #
#Where seldom is heard
a discouraging word... #
#... and the skies
are not cloudy all day. #
Everybody!
Sorry!
Could you hand me my robe, please?
The pink... satin.
It's by the...
Thank you.
It's an unfortunate side-effect
of my... pills. They're a... diuretic.
Gross!
A diuretic... It means you go
number 1, not number 2.
Listen, I'm... sorry
about those Ersatz women.
What?
"Ersatz" means phony, something
pretending to be something it's not.
I thought they were nice.
Zoologists are the guys
that work in the zoos, right?
Yes, among other places.
I never met my real dad.
My mom never talked about him.
I'm gonna go live with him.
As soon as I get enough money...
...I can get some nice clothes...
...knock on his door, surprise him.
Do your mom and dad
live in California too?
My parents are dead.
Do you like zoos?
I don't mind the modern ones,
I guess.
The animals... may not be free,
but they're safe.
Yeah.
Me too.
Good night.
- Did you go to a college?
- Yes.
- What did you study?
- A lot of things.
French, cultural anthropology,
archeology, psychology, art history.
Possum. Biology.
80 million years ago,
during the Cretaceous Period...
...these plains were the floor
of a huge inland sea.
Are we there yet?
If you don't wanna learn anything,
then never mind.
Alright, I'm listening.
It cut the entire continent in two.
Dinosaurs lived on either side.
Then, a huge meteor struck the earth.
Some say that's why
the dinosaurs went extinct.
But why should the insects,
birds and mammals have survived.
- Why? - I don't know. But it's always
seemed a bit fishy to me.
Did you know they found giant shark
remains in the middle of Kansas?
- How big were they? - Big enough
to swallow you without even chewing.
- Got you.
- You did not.
I got you!
- You got me in the eye!
- I'm so sorry!
Did I hurt you?
Got you!
Stop it!
Seriously, watch the road!
You drive. I hope we pass a rest stop
soon. My diuretic's kicking in.
Do rattlesnakes come out at night?
Well...
...I must say that's a relief.
Something wrong?
This is a no smoking room.
New Mexico is the ufology capital
of the world.
Ufology, from UFO, the study
of unidentified flying objects.
Social ostracism
doesn't work in a community of two.
Damn it, Toby, say something!
I wanna go to Sammy's Wigwam.
Here are some arrowheads.
They're only a dollar each.
He's been acting like that all day.
Young man, if you don't behave
in a civilized fashion...
...you and I are gonna have
a very serious problem. - Fuck you!
You watch your mouth
around your mother!
She is not my mother!
She's not anyone's mother!
She's not even a real woman.
She's got a dick.
Don't you?
Don't you? Go on, tell him!
You're a fucking lying freak!
What do you want out of me?
Just because a person doesn't blab
around her biological history...
...to everyone she meets
doesn't make her a liar.
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
So you could humiliate me
in public even sooner?
You knew all about me!
Why did you bail me out ofjail?
You just walked into jail
and asked them who needed help?
You know what? Fuck you!
I never heard of a trannie church!
Just drop me off in the next town.
So you don't think I have the right
to belong to a church?
My body may be a work in progress...
...but there is nothing wrong
with my soul!
Jesus made me this way so I could
suffer and be reborn the way he was.
- So you're cutting your dick off
for Jesus? - You don't cut it off.
I'm just gonna have an innie
instead of an outie.
Hi. Is there any chance that you could
offer a fellow traveler a ride?
Absolutely!
We love helping strangers!
Beef, jerky?
No, thanks. I'm a level 4 vegan.
I don't eat anything
that casts a shadow.
- A little token of my appreciation?
- Absolutely.
I'm sorry, but the secondary smoke
might render me unfit to drive.
She's cool, right?
She's not a she. She's got a dick.
- Toby!
- For now at least.
You're a guy?
- I'm a transsexual woman.
- Wow!
I think transsexuality
is a radically evolved state of being.
Hey, look!
Many societies throughout history
have honored and revered...
...transgendered people:
The Zulu, the Yoruba...
The Native Americans
called us "two-spirit people".
Two spirits. Cool!
Tell him what they're gonna do
with your dick!
Then the settlers came
and tended to murder us on sight.
The way the white man treated
the Indian was very deeply fucked up.
- Yeah.
- Are you sure you won't join us?
Come on! We know what you've got!
You boys go ahead. Have fun.
So what do you do when you're not
following the open road?
- I'm a peyote shaman.
- How do you do that?
It involves consuming
majestic amounts of peyote.
And when you're done throwing up...
...you see things.
- What things?
- Once I saw my own death.
Do you by any chance
drown in a desert lake?
No. I die in a depressurization
accident on a moon colony.
I'II show you something.
It's in my bag.
Do you still think what you said
back at Sammy's wigwam?
What?
That I'm a freak.
You're not a freak.
You're just a liar.
Oh, shit!
My purse!
My hormones!
You dirty motherfucking hippie!
My dog book was in that car.
Oh, God...
Oh, God... Oh, God...
My surgery...
I have to be in L.A. In 2 days.
What are we going to do?
- Is it soothing?
- I could sell it.
How much could you get?
Come on! Let's go!
Having a tough day?
I don't care about the car.
I just need to get to L.A.
As quickly as possible.
I'm driving a couple of ponies over
to the sale in Show Low next morning.
I could give you a ride that far.
- Woodrow, can I get a burger
for the young lady here? - Yep!
- Isn't Calvin an unusual name
for a Native American? - Not really.
My brothers are named Dwight, Lloyd,
Darryl and Woodrow.
- What's your last name?
- Manygoats.
- It's my mother's clan name.
- A matrilineal kinship system!
- Is there a Mrs. Manygoats?
- No. Not yet.
I guess the right woman
hasn't met me.
There you are!
Calvin, I'd like you to meet Toby.
Toby, this is Calvin Manygoats.
How're you doing, son?
I saved you half a hamburger.
Calvin's offered us a place
for tonight and a ride in the morning.
- Isn't that generous of him?
- I guess.
Excuse me, just a minute.
You... already found a buyer?
At least now you don't have
any more of that damn drug.
Shower.
So...
...Calvin, have you... spent all
your life in New Mexico? - Not yet!
- It's beautiful.
- It's home!
Hi.
It's Mescal.
A friend of mine brings it up
from Oaxaca.
#Beautiful dreamer,
wake unto me... #
#... starlight and dewdrops
are waiting for thee. #
#Sounds of the rude world
heard in the day... #
#... lulled by the moonlight
have all passed away. #
#Beautiful dreamer,
queen of my song... #
#... list while I woo thee
with soft melody. #
#Gone are the cares
of life's busy throng... #
#... beautiful dreamer
awake unto me. #
#Beautiful dreamer,
awake unto me. #
You can sing!
Just enough to keep the dogs off
the back porch! That's all.
Come on.
Thank you.
- That'II put hair on your chest.
- I hope not!
Good morning, sleepy head.
Calvin's gonna drive us
all the way to Phoenix.
Do my breasts seem smaller to you?
I've missed 2 doses of my pills.
Play with the body's hormonal balance
and you're playing with fire.
Playing with fire!
Playing with fire!
When you wear your cowboy hat,
if you wear it like that...
...that means
you're looking for trouble.
If you wear it like that,
you're not looking for trouble.
If you wear it off to the side,
you're out to impress the ladies!
How come an Indian
wears a cowboy hat?
It keeps the sun out of my eyes better
than a headband and 2 eagle feathers.
Calvin was telling me
that his people are Navajo.
Only part Navajo. My great-great-great
grandfather was Zuni.
You got a Cherokee look about you.
Proud people, them Cherokee!
- You're too young.
- No, I'm not. - Yes, you are.
Here. Drink some water.
Now if you gentlemen will excuse me,
I have to... use the powder room.
- Here.
- Thank you. - Allow me.
Thank you.
There are things about her
she's not telling you.
Every woman has a right
to a little mystery, dude!
You know she's a Jesus freak?
She's probably waiting to convert you.
She can convert me
anytime she wants to.
I wish I could drive you
all the way to Los Angeles.
So do I.
Let me get that for you.
It's alright.
It doesn't work from the inside.
It sticks a bit.
Thank you.
Bree, there are some things about me,
about my past that you don't know.
We all have our secrets.
I've been in jail more than once.
I'm about blind in one eye...
...and I got half a pound of shrapnel
in my left leg.
But, if you're ever in New Mexico...
...I'd really like it
if you gave me a call.
Thank you, Calvin. I'll do that.
Let's go!
Come here!
This belonged
to a real good friend of mine.
He was a champion
in the All Indian Rodeo circuit.
Now you look like a warrior.
Ma'am...
- Where are we?
- My parents' house.
- I thought you said your parents
were dead. - Wishful thinking.
- Who's Sydney?
- My baby sister.
May I help you?
Is Sydney here?
Sydney's out.
May I tell her who called?
I don't think so.
Don't look at me that way.
I'm not looking at you.
Alright, alright. Shit!
I mean darn. No, I mean shit.
May I help you, young lady?
Dad, it's me.
Mom! Dad!
Mom!
Get in here,
before the neighbors see you!
Jesus Christ!
I can't even recognize you.
It's me... only different.
So you've done it. It's all over.
I don't think
that's any of your business.
Mom!
Thank God! Murray, he's still a boy.
My poor Stanley!
I can't look at you like this!
Why do you always upset her
like that?
I'm just gonna get
something to eat and drink...
...then I'll go back
and wait for Sydney outside.
Are you sure you're alright,
Stanley?
Fabulous. Never been better.
- Stanley...
- Bree!
Sabrina Claire Osborne.
We're gonna need more time
with that.
- Your mother and I love you...
- But we don't respect you.
I'II never understand
why you're doing this to me.
I'm not doing anything to you.
I'm gender dysphoric.
It's a genetic condition.
Don't try to blame
your father and me for this!
Don't use so much mayonnaise. Are you
trying to give yourself a heart attack?
Let me do that!
Do you know what I see
when I look at you?
I see a lost soul
crying out for help.
This would never have happened
if you had only come to church...
...as a child instead of going off
to that synagogue of your father's!
Mom! Dad!
There's a sort of scruffy
looking kid outside.
- Holy shit!
- Language, Sydney!
I don't fucking believe it!
Stanley!
Bree.
Bree...
Well, Bree,
I was hoping you'd show up...
...take some of the heat off me.
It's nice to see you too.
If the kid out there's your boyfriend,
I'm gonna slit my wrists.
- I need to talk to you in private.
- Oh, my God! He is!
You lucky son of a...
I mean, you lucky bitch!
Your boyfriend?!
That filthy teenage juvenile
delinquent who came to the door?
He happens to be a clean, healthy
and respectable young man.
I don't want to hear
any more about it! How old is he?
17.
Oh, my God! Murray, he's underage!
Mom, he's my son.
- You're shitting me?
- Remember Emma Wilkins?
- What are you saying?
- Is Emma here too?
She killed herself.
Jesus! Kinehora!
Are you trying to tell me...
...that that boy
who came to the door...
He's your grandson.
My grandson...
Dear God!
He doesn't know anything
and I don't want him to.
Wait!
Call me grandpa.
You poor thing!
Get up off that filthy ground!
There could be all sorts
of awful things down there.
Look at you!
A handsome boy!
- Do you know who I am? I'm your...
- You're a friend of Bree's mother.
He doesn't know about me.
And I don't want him to know about me.
- Agreed?! You're not gonna say
anything? - No.
- Hi there. I'm Sydney.
- Hey.
Toby.
What do you say?
Toby! Come on inside,
where there's nice air conditioning.
Come on, honey!
I'II make you a nice plate of food!
Defrosted to perfection!
- Finish your vegetables.
- He doesn't like broccoli.
Open up.
Lucky, no!
That dog's a sex maniac!
Just like your father.
At least he gets more action
than I do.
My mom used to live in Phoenix
before I was born.
Really?
What a coincidence!
What'd your name used to be,
when you were a guy?
Honey, why don't you go
and watch TV in the spare bedroom?
You can take the dog.
Come here, boy.
Stanley, what are you planning to do
with that poor boy?
First of all, I'm gonna make sure he
knows he's encouraged and supported.
And that he's respected...
...maybe even...
At least that he's respected.
Behold the return
of the prodigal son!
Can we try to be nice
to each other, please?
This is so bizarre.
I can still see Stanley in you, but...
...it's like
you put yourself through a strainer...
...and got rid of all the boy pulp.
Planning a game of bridge
with the girls?
Can I borrow 1,000 dollars?
You've got to be kidding.
500?
- 250?
- Do I hear a dollar and a half?
I have to account for every penny!
18 months sober and they're still
scared shitless I'm gonna relapse...
...and wind up passed out on the floor
bed in some dive down on Van Buren.
God, those were the days!
My surgery's the day after tomorrow.
I need airfare to get home.
Growing up I always thought
you were the lucky one.
Try this one!
Oh, my God!
No, it'II be like
"Showgirls" and "Ice Capades".
I'm a transsexual,
not a transvestite.
Yeah, but it'll really freak Mom out!
I've lost all credibility now.
Toby, don't break that, honey.
It's very expensive.
Murray, I just hate
the way you had Lucky's tail clipped!
It stands straight up like that,
just like a penis.
- Black and hairy?
- Well, it does!
- Not like any penis I've ever seen!
- Me neither.
Toby!
Toby, come over here
and let me fix your hair. Come on!
Come on, honey!
Stay!
Sit!
You have such nice thick hair!
Just like mine.
And those clothes
are a great improvement.
- They fit good, huh?
- They fit well!
Grammar police!
Good evening.
That dress looks
perfectly ridiculous.
You're looking very handsome.
You look good too.
- Beauty is relative.
- For God's sake, Mom!
Don't pick on me, not tonight!
I can't take it!
I used to read pornography
on the toilet and ever since...
...I have shitty sex.
- You get it?
- Yeah...
Thank you.
Toby, come and sit here next to me!
Here, take a picture!
Murray, scoot over!
Come on, honey, right here!
That's right.
Toby, honey, lean in place.
Alright, everybody,
1, 2, 3...
We all look much happier
than we really are.
Can you take one
of the two of us?
I'II take it.
Nice to see a young man
being so polite to his mother.
That's not his mother.
And a hamburger for the young
gentleman. Enjoy your meal!
Toby, do you want to say grace?
Go ahead, honey! Don't be shy!
God bless this restaurant...
...and... these thy gifts
that we are about to receive forever...
...and ever.
And thank you, Lord,
for bringing Toby to us.
And, please, let us all stay together
in health and spirits...
...in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
- Amen.
Shalom Yisrael.
Toby, honey, don't take
the lettuce out of your hamburger.
It's good for you.
Sydney, don't play with your food!
Sieg heil!
- Can I borrow 1,000 dollars?
- Toby, your hamburger's almost raw!
- Let me send that back.
- I can pay it back with interest.
- What do you need the money for?
- To get back to L.A.
Look at your life.
You've never been able
to stick to a decision.
10 years of college
and not a single degree.
How do you know
you won't change your mind?
Because I know.
Don't do this awful thing
to yourself, please!
I miss my son.
Mom...
...you never had a son.
How can you say such a thing?
Now you know how I felt when you hired
those private detectives.
We only tried to do the best for you.
Is that why you tried
to have me committed?
You tried to kill yourself!
Because you tried
to have me committed!
I don't know why you have
to be so emotional.
I am not emotional!
- God, my cycle's all out of whack!
- You don't have cycles!
Hormones are hormones.
Yours and mine just happen
to come in little purple pills.
- Young man! May we get some doggie
bags here, please? - Yes, ma'am.
I am going to finish
cooking his hamburger at home!
Murray, give me your wallet!
Here's 200 dollars.
We'll get the rest out of the safe.
There's one condition.
I want Toby to stay here with me.
Wouldn't you like that, honey?
You could have
your own little apartment.
We'll remodel the guest house!
Do you like to play tennis? We have
8 new courts at the Country Club.
Murray and I just feel that
you need a stable, loving family...
...with the means to give you
every chance that you deserve.
Toby! There you are, baby!
Half Italian villa,
half Country Club.
- Beauty is relative.
- Not my relatives!
I wish just once they'd look at me
and see me.
That's all.
Just really see me.
Why are they being so nice to me?
You think I ought to stay here?
Do you want to?
It's pretty nice.
I think you ought to do
whatever you think is best for you.
But if you want...
...you can come and live with me.
I can't give you anything like this,
but I'm sure we can manage something.
Did you really try to kill yourself?
I swallowed
half a bottle of Nembutal.
Then I panicked and called 911.
- Maybe you're not the suicidal type.
- Maybe.
Unless my mother is right
and I just can't stick to a decision.
Come in.
- Can't you sleep?
- Not really.
Do you need something?
- A glass of milk?
- No.
What is it?
I must look awful.
You look good.
You look well.
Don't worry.
What are you doing?
What I'm good at.
- No! No!
- It's okay. I want to.
You'II like it, I promise.
I don't wanna like it.
I don't wanna it at all.
Okay.
I'II marry you if you want.
I don't care how big your place is.
I just wanna be with you.
I think you're sexy, Bree.
It's like... I can see you.
Oh, God.
Oh, no. Put your clothes on.
I mean it. Right now. Stop it.
- What's the matter? - Would you
please just cover yourself up?!
- I am such a total shit.
- No, you're not.
There's something I should have told
you a long time ago.
You're gonna hate me.
I'm not really... exactly...
...affiliated with the church.
I already figured that out.
What?
It's my mom and dad.
It's your mom...
...and me.
Toby...
...I'm so sorry.
I know I shouldn't have lied to you.
I know how disappointed you must be...
...your one bedroom apartment
instead of a mansion...
...half Jewish
instead of half Indian.
Toby!
Why don't we look on the bright side?
We've gotten to know each other...
...our strengths and weaknesses. And
we're still good friends. Aren't we?
I'm so sorry! I truly...
Really I didn't mean to hurt you!
My mother's probably right.
I'm a terrible influence.
Please, this is a terrible time
for me. I should be... Toby, wait!
You are not my father!
Oh, God!
Honey...
There...
He didn't mean it, honey...
He's just a bit upset...
There now...
There... There...
Toby's gone!
He took my purse
and my bucking bronco statue.
What do you want to do, Sta...?
Bree!
He's 17, but you don't know
his date of birth?
What's your relationship
to the missing boy?
I am his father.
- Can't you put out an APB
or something? - We'll do our best.
I'm sorry to say this, but chances are
if he doesn't wanna be found...
...he's gonna stay lost.
Hey!
This is Bree.
Thank you very much.
Everything's fine.
The surgery was a complete success.
Hello, my baby!
How are you feeling?
And don't say "like a new woman"!
I... feel like a...
medieval heretic...
...impaled on a very large
and very thick... stake...
...with splinters.
Nice hat!
It was a present.
Bree, why do I get the feeling that
there's something not quite right?
Last week you said this was gonna be
the happiest day of your life.
Last week was a long time ago.
Talk to me.
I fucked up.
It hurts.
Oh, my sweetie...
That's what hearts do.
I'm sorry.
No. Let it out.
This is good.
¡Ay! ¡Qué regalo para mí!
- Amo la comida mexicana.
- Amo la comida mexicana.
¡Y amo... a Fernando!
Amo la comida mexicana.
Mexicana.
School's going to be closing
in about 15 minutes.
Wayne, this is really hard.
Do you think you could give me a hand?
Sure. What subject?
Sex education.
Alright, cut!
Lucky, needs help again!
Let's go!
- Did you take your Viagra?
- Yes, ma'am.
- When's the last time you came?
- About 2 hours ago.
Christ, kid! You've got to focus!
Can you focus?
We are behind schedule.
We've got to move!
Toby!
Don't think that I'm fucking
forgiving you, because I'm not.
Alright.
I just came over to see
if you did it.
Did what?
Got your dick turned inside out.
Yes.
Won't you come in?
Just for a little while?
I have something for you.
What?
Please.
Your parents' house is a lot nicer.
My parents' house
comes with my parents.
I thought you said we were Jewish.
Half Jewish through my father,
so it's technically the wrong half.
And you're only a quarter.
The wrong quarter.
I'm gonna finish up my degree.
I thought I'd take up teaching...
...maybe rent a house some place...
...some place with a yard.
What have you got for me?
Hang on a minute.
I've missed you.
Have a seat.
So how have you been?
I'm doing alright.
Would you care to divulge
a few more details?
- I'm making a movie.
- You are?
I told you I could.
They're already
doing the advertisement for it.
"Cowabunghole".
That's Dylan Reeves.
He's a big star.
And there's you.
It's a very... nice picture.
I like your hair.
If you wanna, I could get you
a discount when it comes out.
Thank you. That's very considerate.
I got these clothes
at the Beverly Center, Beverly Hills.
Would you like a coke?
I'II take a beer.
Alright.
Young man...
...if you think you can put your dirty
shoes on my brand new coffee table...
...you're gonna have to think again.
