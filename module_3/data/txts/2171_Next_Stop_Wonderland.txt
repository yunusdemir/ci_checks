Look, I didn't-- I didn't
mean it to be this way.
This-- Every-- The reasons why
I'm leaving are on this tape.
It points out the six
points of why I think...
our relationship is doomed
and why I'm leaving it.
You can watch it later.
I was gonna mail it...
but now-- I'll just
give it to you now.
Are you taking your VCR, or
did you leave that upstairs?
I bought the VCR! I'm taking my VCR!
I bought-- It's the
only thing I'm taking.
What is that on top of the car?
Is that a futon on top of the car?
That's-- That's our
futon. That's my futon.
I'm takin' the-- Can I
please take the futon?
Please?
- Violence is not the answer!
- Get in the car!
Don't be drivin' back here
in a couple days, okay?
I'm not going through this
over and over and over.
I-I-I'm not--
That's on the tape.
I-I think that's point
number four on the tape...
because I have my vision,
you have your vision...
and I'm leaving, because
the Tantoonis need me.
- The who?
- The Tantoonis.
- What is-- - It's an Indian
tribe. It was in the newspaper.
It was on CNN! You don't even watch TV.
You don't read the paper. You don't
know what's going on in the world!
That's one of my
reasons. That's point one!
- You can't just walk out, Sean.
- Listen, listen.
I'm gonna go, and I'm not coming back.
- Take Fidel.
- Please take Fidel.
I'm not taking Fidel, Sean.
I'm not taking your fucking cat!
I don't have the time and
energy to take care of the cat.
I have to go and get
something accomplished.
That cat will be in the
way-- Ow! I am a man of peace!
You are a woman of violence.
I'm not a man like that.
And you're turning me into that man-- That's
like point number eight. I don't know--
- Hi. Good night.
- Good night, Erin. Have a good night.
Dr. Kravitz, you have a
visitor in the main lobby.
Dr. Kravitz, a visitor
in the main lobby.
Do you guys know Bob, that
security guard from the lobby?
- Mmm, he's really something, huh?
- Yeah.
He asked me to go to this little
soiree with him on Saturday...
to the aquarium, 'cause that's where
he used to work, and then yesterday...
he drops, like he mentions,
that Rick hit on him last summer.
Oh, he didn't say that! I only flirted.
It was his uniform. I couldn't resist!
I know, but the thing is...
he said some really mean and nasty things
about you, and it made me feel really bad.
All right, so he's a homophobic prick.
So what else is new? Story of my life.
I already said yes, that I would go.
- You left me the witches' costume?
- Honey, it's you!
- Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.
- You're confused, honey.
What would you do if you were me, Erin?
Well, you want to get out of it?
Yeah.
Tell Bob that you're meeting...
a friend and her "date" at the party.
When her date doesn't show up, she
gets really upset, she wants to leave.
You need to take her home,
and then you're out. That's it.
It's really simple. Men
are really easy to trick.
- Or treat--you witch! - That's
perfect! I need a friend, though.
I have no friends, so, Erin, will you
please go with me and be my friend?
- No. I hate parties.
- Yes! You always have a reason. Please come with me?
Oh, Erin,you have just got to go!
I mean, what man could resist
the wicked witch of the west wing?
- Listen, my mother is
in town this weekend.
- I don't have any time. I have to be with her.
- Yeah, okay, well.
Wait a minute. My mother
is in town this weekend.
Yeah, I'll go.
Oh, thank you!
Trick or treat!
Mama! Mama!
Oh, oh, honey!
Mama!
- I want my daddy!
- Mama!
Daddy!
- I found it.
- You haven't got much Wordsworth, have you?
- No.
- I'll let you have that one half price.
- Oh, shoot!
- Got it?
- Yep.
- There you go. No, no, no.
Don't close it. You should never close a
book until you've read something from it.
- What?
-Just a sentence or a word. It can be very, very revealing.
Just read something, anything.
Read from the top, then.
"When from our better selves we have too
long been parted by the hurrying world...
and droop, sick of its business, of
its pleasures tired, how gracious...
how benign is Solitude."

#Oh, how lovely##
Hi, it's Mom. I fly in at
9:30 tomorrow morning...
so I'll see you at the gate.
Hope we can have a little fun tomorrow
night. Kick up our heels or something?
Airport Station next.
Change here for the airport
terminal shuttle. Next stop, Airport.
Change here for the Logan
Airport terminal shuttle.
The airport shuttle
service is located...
up the escalator, to the left.
Inbound train approaching.
This is Airport Station.
Stay clear of the doors.
Aquarium Station next.
Next stop, Aquarium.
Welcome to the Boston Aquarium...
home of Myrtle, the turtle,
and Puff, the balloonfish.
What's expanding faster
than Puff, the balloonfish?
We are-- The North
Addition-- coming in 1999.
Watch us grow!
Hey, you guys? Who is this?
That is... Fred Astaire?
No, no, no. This is Burgess Meredith.
Remember? I was telling you this yesterday.
You have to recognize that marking there.
- By his neck?
- I knew it.
Well, he escaped from
the tray again last night.
Oh, don't worry about it. That's
okay. I mean, they always escape.
- Hey, Ben.
- How you doin'?
Hey, Yuri needs you for a second down
in pumps. He has another pipe leak.
I-I-I can't, Ben. I'm
diving in two minutes.
- It's a two-minute job--
for you, anyway! - Hey, Ben.
Did you have a chance to go over the
Assistant Aquarist application I put in?
Okay, nothing's been decided.
But you're still in the running.
All right. Thanks, Ben.
The dolphin
show begins in--
Ahh, good!
I'm a volunteer diver, not
volunteer plumber, Yuri.
This is the last time I'm comin'
down and doin' you a favor, all right?
I'm not getting paid for this. I don't want
to be down here helping you. No moreski.
Ahh... I do--
I do you favor.
Yuri, first of all, what's this? You
have, like, half a gasket in here.
Where's the other half
of the gasket, huh?
Bye!
So, there isn't a problem.
Just fax it to the hotel.
I'll sign it, and then
I'll fax it back. All right.
Now, darling, you weren't there.
-And this gentleman-- -I was
there, Mom. Your plane was early.
Well, whatever. I didn't see you, and
I thought you weren't gonna make it...
so this very lovely man offered me a
ride, and so I took it and I'm sorry...
- Okay, forget about it.
- but I did leave you a message on the machine.
It gave me some time to walk
around. I went to the aquarium.
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Let me make it up to you.
My latest acquisition.
What do you think?
Blinding teeth.
- Well, he's available.
- What?
- They're not all gay, you know.
- Piper!
Darling!
- Oh, hi!
- Oh, my God!
- It's good to see you!
- I have never, ever seen you in red.
What has happened?
- Oh, this isn't red. This is Hollywood black.
- You look great.
And this-- Look at this.
This is my latest find.
He is going to be the
biggest thing ever.
- Isn't he big now?
- Oh,yes,you know, he is.
- It pays the tuition.
- Tuition?
- I'm in med school.
- Really?
My daughter went to medical
school. Yes, Harvard.
- Harvard.
- Yes. She didn't want to continue.
I didn't finish.
She didn't finish because it
was her choice not to finish.
She had the highest grade point
average of any female at Harvard.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, she did.
- No. No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- Piper.
- I did not!
- So, what are you doing now?
- I'm a phlebotomist.
You-You study insects?
She is not a phlebotomist. She is
a registered nurse, a profession...
her late father esteemed very highly.
And she's a very good one.
- I'll see you later.
- It's inevitable to see you later.
Bye-bye, Rory. Good luck to you.
He'll need it.
So, how's the old place?
- It's quiet.
- Hmm. Renovations?
We never finished.
Hmm.
Have you really been by
yourself ever since that--
that, that Marxist left?
- He was an activist, Mother.
- Well, it's the same thing.
I must say I was delighted when I
heard you gave him his walking papers.
Sean left me, Mom.
No. And you let him?
Did I have a choice?
Dear, sweetness...
light of my life.
With men, you always have a choice.
Well, you didn't.
Mmm. Mmm.
I'm sorry, Mom. I don't
know why I said that.
- It's okay.
- There's no comparison.
You're right.
Loss is loss. It's the
same thing, either way.
You know what I think your
father would have wanted?
I think he would want you to move on...
find yourself a new
man and be happy again.
- I am happy.
- Well, there's no crime in showing it, is there?
Look, Mom. I know that you
don't think that a woman...
- can be alone and be content.
- What are you talking about?
This is me you're talking
to. Of course, I do.
Oh, come on. You are never
alone. You're always surrounded...
by all these people.
Listen, what are we going to do tonight?
I had an idea. Um, thought maybe
Dodge and I would come over...
- to the old apartment and
have some cocktails-- - Dodge?
- Dodge!
- Who is Dodge?
The gentleman I met at the
airport. I told you this!
- You never listen to me!
- His name is Dodge?
His name is Dodge, and we
thought we'd take you out tonight.
- I have a date. - Dodge and I
thought we would have some drinks--
- What?
- I have a date.
You have a date! Goddamn you.
What have I been carrying
on about? Who with?
Who's it with? Come on.
A girl from work.
This is Wonderland Station...
in the Wonderland commuter parking lot.
A quarter-pound of pecorino, please.
The price of cheese.
Reporter Arnie Reisman has
been following that story.
It's only the latest in a series...
of anonymous acts of vandalism that began
last month during the Boston Aquarium's...
prolonged legal battle
with Lesser Construction.
Yesterday, Lesser
Construction lost its bid...
to build a state-of-the-art
mausoleum...
on this waterfront lot...
now officially, future home of
the aquarium's North Addition.
I want to congratulate Miss
Shebola and the aquarium...
for getting the approval
for their Addition.
Now, the good people of Boston will
have a place to cavort with fish...
instead of a place to
properly, hygienically...
not to mention economically,
bury their loved ones.
Now, this will not send
our company, in any sense...
into any kind of financial distress.
We're now in the business
of building privately run...
for-profit, commercial prisons.
There's no need to tell
you how successful they are.
What about the allegations that
you're behind the aquarium vandalism?
That is very-- I've
heard-- That's ridiculous.
I love fish. They're good
creatures. I've nothing against them.
Are you worried that you're going to wind
up in the same prison you're building?
- Is that funny?
- That's enough!
- You're actin'like an idiot!
- Stupid!
I am not acting like an idiot!
No,you're not actin'like an idiot.
-You just don't fuckin' listen!
-Who do you think you are, leavin' here?
- You're actin'
like-- - Take it easy!
Hey, hey, hey, cut, cut, cut!
Will you guys please shut up?
- What is the matter with you?
- Sorry. We had an argument, all right? I'm sorry.
Try to keep it down.
Will you please try and keep
it down? He's trying to study.
- Have a little respect.
- Who cares what other fuckin' people say?
You moron!
- I'm not an idiot,you are!
- Man!
...their continued support
for the protesters...
said they now prefer to
negotiate with developers.
- This is Renita Harrow, BSN News.
- I don't give a damn!
And it is with pride that I pronounce...
that when construction finishes
on the North Addition in 1999...
Boston will again have...
the nation's premiere public aquarium.
Let us christen this voyage
tonight, leave the port...
move forward, put the
bad water behind us.
On behalf of myself and Puff...
- our little fish mascot...
- Frankie, get me a drink.
- You got it, Arty.
- enjoy the festivities.
Thank you.
#I was born into the willows#
#I'm in love with you for you#
#And a word for the emotion
is it fa-so-la-te-do#
So, what kind of an idiot
would blow off a woman like you?
- He's a bastard.
- Let me tell you something about this guy.
He's a little acey-deucey.
You know what I mean. No straight guy...
in his right mind would
blow off a woman like you.
Yeah, well, I guess
it wasn't meant to be.
- I don't know. I think I'm gonna go home.
- No, wait.
What do you say I go with you?
You're alone, I'm security.
- I mean, she and I, we're not even involved.
- As far as I'm concerned, Bob...
there is no security.
Only security guards.
Hey! Hello. Hey, Erin.
- Could I just have a minute?
- Certainly. Certainly.
See you, Bob.
Okay, all right. Are
we done? Can we go now?
Are you done? Can you go?
Wait a minute. I thought that the
whole point was that I would be here--
Right. But now the point seems to be...
that you are really
preoccupied with my date.
Oh, I'm preoccupied with Bob.
Hey! We havin' a good time?
- Hi!
- Hi! Cricket, what do you say we dance, right now?
- I'd love to.
- Great!
#When she walks she's like a samba#
-#That swings so cool and sways so gentle##
- Alan! Alan!
Yeah?
Bob? Bob? Remember?
- Bob, how are you?
- This is Cricket. Cricket, Alan. Alan, Cricket.
- How are you?
- Hi.
Cricket's a nurse where I work now.
- Over at the, uh,
hospital. - Uh-huh.
Hey, we could have used you here last week
what with the shenanigans and everything.
A guy like Bob. Back in
the saddle again, huh, Bob?
If I were still here, that
shit would never happen.
- Good seeing you.
- Alan.
- You here alone?
- Yes, I am.
I got a chick you're not gonna believe.
A hot chick, free thinker, rubbin' against
the furniture right now, all by her lonesome.
She's trawlin'for action,
beggin'for somethin'...
and I think you're the kind
of guy that can give it to her.
Well, you know, Bob. I'm really quite
flattered that you'd think of me...
but to tell you the truth,
I'm real busy at the moment.
- So, I'll see you later.
- Wait a minute.
- What are you, some kind of fag?
- Alan!
Yo, Alan! How are ya?
- Oh, shit.
- I'll meet ya at the bar!
- Great to see you again, Bob.
- Good to see ya.
Where ya been, buddy?
Hey, I'm gettin' the feeling
you're trying to avoid me.
No, no, no. I'm not avoiding you, Frank.
I'm very busy, you know. I've got
classes. I'm volunteering here.
- I got a little favor I gotta ask ya.
- Oh, Christ, Frank.
- If this is about your toilet, I can't come by every time.
- No, no, no.
It's flushin' like a
champ since you been there.
Listen, uh, maybe you can
take me on a little tour.
- You want a little tour, Frank?
- Yeah.
You can show me that little Poof
fish that's on the news all the time.
Puff, Frank. It's a puffer
fish, all right? Come on.
When threatened, a balloonfish...
- can rapidly inflate its
body with water or air.
Frank! Do you see where it
says, "Do not tap on the glass"?
All right? These are
very sensitive fish.
- They got feelings?
- Yeah, they do, Frank. You know what?
You're really not supposed to smoke here,
so why don't we go back where we came from?
And I'll just see you in a couple days
and I'll give you some money, all right?
You were doin'just fine
when you were plumbin', Al.
When you were workin' with your
father, when you were a team.
Look, Frank. You did me a really
big favor by lending me the money...
so I could go to school, but
I'm a full-time student now...
and it's just gonna take
me a little more time.
- I can't give you any more time.
- Christ, Frank.
What do you expect me to
do? I don't have any money.
Small favor. Do it, and I'll
knock off the interest on the loan.
The North Addition, coming in 1999.
Certain people just want
a message sent, that's all.
So what is this... favor?
Just eliminate the fish. That's it.
- Puff?
- Yeah, Puff!
What, are you kidding me, Frank?
- There's no way. - Oh, for Christ's
sake, it's a goddamn, pansy-ass fish!
Look at it!
Ladies.
You know, Frank. I can't believe
that you're asking me to do this!
I'm not gonna do it! But
don't worry. You know what.
'Cause I will definitely get you
your money, one way the other.
Next Monday, I will see you. I will have
your money, plus your three points, all right?
Hey, Alan. Who's gonna loan
you the money, your father?
He's at the dog track, blowin' the
two grand I fronted him last week.
Biologists call it
a defense mechanism...
because it defends the fish against
attacks by hungry predators, like sharks.
Smile! Hey, looks like you
just made the society page!
What's your name, gorgeous?
Hi, this is Erin. Please
leave a message after the beep.
- Hi, doll. I've got some
interesting news for you.
Okay, now. If you look
in this week's Herald--
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie, it's me. I'm in London.
I just picked up a copy of the Herald.
- Yeah, I know. I saw it.
- What do you mean you saw it?
- Who spoiled it for you?
- What are you talking about?
Wait a minute. Why do you have
the Herald? Aren't you in London?
If you'll just look at page
67, I'll be able to tell you.
Wait, these are-- These
are the personal ads.
Just look...
in the middle of the second column...
right between "Vivacious
Vixen" and "Wasting Away."
"Waiting For You. Do you
believe in destiny? I do.
Be part of mine. Me: 29, five foot six.
Brains, beauty, body, all in one.
Frisky, cultured and carefree
professional with zest for life.
Number one in fun! You:
Sophisticated, smart...
and sumptuous success story
who will make me smile.
Us: Soul mates seeking
spontaneous combustion?
Pervs or drunks need not apply."
Darling, you sound so
excited! I'm very happy!
You put in a personal ad for me?
I admit I did have a little
help from my publicist.
- Oh, my God.
- Darling, look.
If you're not going to help
yourself, I feel, as your mother...
that I have the right to help you...
- if I can.
- As my mother? As my pimp is more like it.
Look, sweetie, it's only an option.
You can access your messages by dialing a
four-digit code. I gave you your birthday, 1966.
You know, Ma, I would never do this.
Never! And-And, who is this person?
" Frisky, carefree,
with a zest for I--"
Oh. This is you. Isn't it, Mom?
- This is you.
- No, sweetie, it is not me. It is you.
It is the you I remember, the
sweet, darling, happy you...
that you used
to be before--
I'm sorry.
I've got to get ready to go to work.
I know.
Listen. I just wanted to remind you,
actually, about Thanksgiving in Manhattan.
I won't forget about
Thanksgiving, Mom. I'll be there.
Feel free to bring a
new friend, if you like.
Yes. Here we are, ladies and
gentlemen. The angler fish.
This is the female, by the
way. My apologies, ladies.
Nature can be cruel.
Can anyone tell me, out of interest...
why the male is so humbly displayed?
Come on, people. Wake up! Someone!
Someone other than
Alan. Anybody but Alan.
Okay, Alan.
- The, um, Ceratadeam--
- Ceratoidea.
Ceratoidea has evolved so
that the male is always...
right there with the female,
ready to inject it with the sperm.
It's what you would call
a symbiotic relationship.
Thank you, Alan. Another
amazingly accurate answer.
Moving on, next snapshot, if you would.
Ahh. The Coelacanth.
Now, the Coelacanth...
is known to be one of the most
elusive of the deep-sea creatures.
Julie, come here, no. Ladies
and gentlemen, I stand corrected.
This is probably the most
elusive of the sea creatures.
- By sea, I mean "C" or maybe
" D" or most probably " F."
- Sit down.
- Sorry.
- I'd like to see you in
the office a little later.
- You're the only one who takes notes, Alan.
- Everybody takes notes.
- Duh. - They have
notebooks, and you have a--
You know, you're a tutor and you should
be making sure I do things like that.
- Wait a minute. Julie, I'm not your tutor.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- I hired you.
No, you didn't hire
me. I'm just a friend.
- You make it sound like I'm some old man or something.
- Well, you gotta help me, then.
I'll give you my notes, all right?
- Make copies of them, and definitely
copy-- - Let's go to the study hall now.
- And then you can, like, catch me up a little.
- No, no, tell you what.
Take the notebook. Give it back to me
tomorrow. I gotta see Ray about my paper.
- You're such a pill! - What're
you talking about? I'm not a--
I like a good time as
much as the next guy.
I'm just... not the next
guy. I'll see you later.
Good morning, Boston!
Twenty minutes past the hour.
Rick,you are definitely water.
Olly, I know you're fire, all right?
So, how did you two meet?
- Well, all right.
- No, no, no, no. I'll tell the story.
- Let me tell the story.
- No, let me, 'cause you always lie.
- I don't lie. I embellish.
- Make it juicy.Just tell me!
Oh, it was about four years ago. I
was out on the duck tour,you know?
- Oh,yeah.
- You know, the amphibious thing that goes in the water?
- Can I tell the story? Thank you.
- I'm embellishing.
- I get seasick really easily.
- We were still on Newbury Street.
We weren't even in the
harbor yet. He's seasick.
I was on
the side--
I was on the side.
Basically, I was getting sick.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, but as a nurse I'm used to that kind of thing...
- and I took right over, didn't I?
- You did.
I was very professional.
And, I consider myself, now...
the luckiest nurse in all of Boston.
Except, of course, for you, Erin.
- Erin, this is a great shot.
- Correction, my dear.
- That is not luck. That is fate.
- I don't believe in fate.
What?
What, like there's some unseen hand
leading you down the garden path?
- Exactly.
- I wish. I'm sorry, I don't believe it.
- It isn't necessarily unseen--
- Unseen hands can be fun!
I totally believe in fate.
I mean, like, for instance...
if Erin hadn't been at the
aquarium party the other night...
I never would have realized
how much I wanted Bob.
- Ta-da! -
Who's Bob?
- This guy that I'm dating.
- Case in point.
- You know, I heard he quit.
- What?
No, Bob was fired, actually. He was
demonstrating how to load his gun...
in the commissary--
to a small child.
Yeah, well, that was,
like, a total setup.
I don't know, Erin. I mean,you
have to believe in something, right?
-It makes life more fun.
-That's right! And Erin is the fun girl.
- Fun, fun, fun.
- Yes. All of Boston society knows it now.
You look great.
All right, all right. Here's
one, here's one. Ready?
"I am a divergent thinker with a
sharp wit, but a reflective soul." Hmm?
"I value quiet reads, sublime sunsets...
humor, tenderness and balance."
That's not a personal ad! That's
a fuckin' daily affirmation!
I'll find you a personal ad.
Alan, are you in?
What are you talkin' about? In what?
Oh, it's a bet. We're all gonna
reply to the same personal ad.
We go out with the chick.
First guy who scores gets
200 bucks from the two losers.
- Right on.
- Or three.
So I guess Traci's
what--history?
No, I ain't got time for a
townie-- I mean, no offense, bro.
None taken, bro.
- What do you say? You in or-- -Okay,
so what do you have to do to win?
Well, we agreed on it.
It's gotta be a French kiss.
- That's tongues... intermingling consensually, right? Right?
- Exactly.
- Unforced. That means you, all right?
- Yeah, unforced.
Just out of curiosity, hold on a second.
How will the two losers know
that the winner actually won?
- We watch it.
- Right.
- We'll be there. - Incognito.
- Yeah. We'll be in disguise.
- It's gonna be great. Are you gonna be in or what?
- Well, no. Are you kiddin'?
That's, like, the stupidest
thing I've heard in my life.
Of course I'm not in. Maybe it's
just when you get to be my age.
I realize that I can only be who I am. I
can't present myself in any different way.
I don't wanna meet somebody who
presents herself in a different way...
because then you have two people that
are basically lying, gettin' together...
talkin' a bunch of crap, you know?
I know this firsthand, because
what I've been tryin'to do...
is to change my destiny and not just
spend the rest of my life being a plumber.
Not that there's anything wrong with
plumbing, but it gives me a freedom.
I can pursue the thing I really love.
How do you find what you love?
- Well, I think--
- I'm kidding.
Oh, man!
Things are getting like--Jesus, what
are we? A bunch of chicks or something?
-Bob's probably my soul mate.
-I believe that. I totally believe that.
- How could you say that?
- I dearly hope that Bob is not your soul mate.
Look, look. It's not about Bob.
It's about whether or not there's
meaning and direction in our lives.
- I suggested that-- - Well,
there isn't! There isn't!
What do you mean, "There isn't"?
I'm not saying there's not meaning,
but there's no direction, you know?
Case in point, my parents.
They met on an airplane.
They were flying back from Paris.
The only reason my mother was on the flight--
she was supposed to be on earlier flight--
But on the way to the airport, her
taxi struck and killed a little dog...
who was chasing a little furry
squirrel, and she was delayed.
That's a totally random act,you know?
- That's why she met my father.
- No, Erin, that is fate.
- Oh, come on.
- Tell that to the dog.
- Yes, tell that to the dog.
- No, no, I'm serious!
- You don't want to be a plumber, Alan.
- Yeah, but the point is...
I don't wanna be a plumber, but
I got nothin' against my father.
I got nothin' against my grandfather.
He's doin' what he wants to do.
I'm tryin' to do what I want to do.
What are you doing? You're
going to be a marine biologist?
- Is that it?
- Yeah.
I'll tell you something. I
don't know from marine biology.
But, I don't see any money in
it. I mean, plumbing. Money.
And you're still workin' with water.
I got nothin' against bein' a plumber.
If someone asks me what I do, and
that's what I'm doin', I'm a plumber.
I mean, it's not about bein' a plumber.
What does Dad think about you
not wantin' to be a plumber?
You know what? I'm gonna go up to
the bar and buy a round of drinks...
to celebrate my brother
movin' to the South End.
You don't have a problem with a
drink from an eastie, do you, Kev?
Sure.
Man. What's the matter
with your brother?
He's got his head in
the books, every night.
I mean, he's studying
and studying and studying.
We never studied that
hard, and it never hurt us.
"Consistency is the
hobgoblin of little minds."
Yeah! Yeah.
- Consistency.
- Of course.
"Is the hobgoblin of the mind."
- Harry! What's happening?
- Hey, Al. How are you, pal? Funny you should stop by.
- You know who was in this morning, lookin' for you?
- Who?
- Frankie.
- What?
You know, Frankie the
collector. Frankie!
- We all know Frankie. What can I get you, my friend?
- Yeah.
- Three Sam Adams and a ginger ale.
- You got it.
So, uh, what's an
attractive girl like you...
doing in a bar so early?
Lookin' for fun, maybe?
What's that on your nose?
- Huh?
- You know, the purple blemish on the end of your nose?
Looks like a basal cell
nevus, or maybe a melanoma?
You know, you may want
to get that checked.
For a man your age, a malignant melanoma
could be fatal if not promptly removed.
"Me:29, five six.
- Brains, beauty, body. All in one.
- That's nice.
Frisky, cultured and carefree
professional with zest for life.
- Number One in fun. "
- "Number One. " That's good.
"Pervs or drunks need
not apply. " Uh-oh.
- That's you two.
- That's funny!
Look, we fake it just like she is.
Gentlemen, believe me, the fact of the
matter is, this woman's not what she seems.
If she's a beauty, I'm a perv, okay?
- Oh, shit! C'mon, man!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
- What's goin'on? You all right?
- I'm fine.
Just spilled some water.
I got it. I got it.
Okay, sugar. You have a good one.
- Will you wake me up when you get in?
- Yep.
- Bye, Oliver.
- See you!
- That's so sweet!
- Olly is so wonderful.
I love how you two met.
I mean, he is so Sag.
Olly would hate me
for telling you this...
but I can't resist.
- We actually met through a gay dating service.
- What?
Manhunters. On the "Meat
Market"bulletin board.
You call in a description,
like "Tenderloin," " Butt."
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding! But
it was through a gay dating service.
But what about the mystery?
Oh, honey, it does not matter
how you meet Mr. or Ms. Right.
I will tell you what
the real mystery is.
The real mystery is:
What keeps two people
together after they meet?

Hi, Erin. Just want to be clear.
This is very important.
I know I've left before.
I know I've come back with my tail
between my legs and cowered and such.
I'm not gonna do that again. I'm
leaving. This is it. I'm fed up.
I don't want to fight with you anymore, and
the reasons are what I'm listing right now--
That's four or five. I can't remember.
First off,is, uh,you've never
come with me once to my rallies.
The reason why you don't want
to come to my rallies is that...
you do not like the
masses, crowds, whatever.
What do you have against the
masses, is what I want to know?
I am in the mass. I am
a member of the crowd.
No new messages. End of messages.
...workers, Erin, is the
only way we as a people...
in this country, we as a people
in this society, will move--
End of messages. You

Say this was a rally, our
relationship, and I showed up to it.
No matter how many signs, how many
slogans, how many things I'm chained to...
I cannot, somehow,
change our relationship.
I can't change you.
I really have to say...
I wonder if any man really ever could.

Hi there. This is, uh, Bob calling.
Hi, I'm, uh, Daryl.
My name is Elliott, and I
am an insurance adjuster.
- Hi!
- Hey, how ya doin', toots? It's me,Joey.
Anyway, let me tell you
a little bit about myself.
I'm active. I'm energetic. I'm outgoing.
Forty-si-- Actually,
43 years old.
I have slightly thinning hair.
None on my back. I have no back hair.
I'd say five nine, five nine and a half.
- Give or take a-- - Let's
just say around six feet.
Let me tell you about
what I do. I'm a, uh--
very successful
30-year-old attorney.
I decided to go back to school, actually,
and get a graduate degree in divinity.
I'm a Vietnam-era vet.
I'm a temp. But that's not,
like, a permanent thing.
I own my business.
I'm calling you from
the office right now.
- My interests are, uh--
- I like women a lot.
I was brought up Catholic, but we
can go into that when I meet you.
- I do pull
-ups, and occasionally I will do a squat thrust.
I think that probably we would
have a lot in common, because, um--
Come on! I get along well with people.
- I actually just finalized my
divorce, about four days ago.
- I have to admit I've got
some, um, some betrayal issues.
- I'm looking for a woman
who is tall, yet clean?
- Someone that likes their mother
and hopefully likes my mother.
Reading your ad made me feel like
we were soul mates, I thought.
- If you could hold on, I have
a fax coming in now. I, uh--
- My number's 5 5 5-- -
9536. And, uh, over and out.
- That was great.
- You know what?
- What?
- You might as well give me the check right now.
You don't have a chance in hell.
Hey! Alan!
Nice computer.
Here's your 13 5 bucks, Frank.
Just like usual. You wanna count it?
Hey, what the hell
happened to your nose?
Let's take a little drive.
Shit.
- Don't matter about the money now.
Don't matter about the money-- Frank!
Look at this grease on my face, man.
You have any idea what I went
through to get this money?
I put my ass...
on the line and vouched for ya.
I thought I could count on you, Alan.
I promised certain people results.
They're expecting results now.
- If they don't get 'em-- - What
did you bring me here for, Frank?
Oh.
Your father's tool kit.
He comes in here yesterday practically
begging for another two grand.
And he gives me this for collateral.
I told him I can't loan him any
more, but he wouldn't take it back.
What am I gonna do
with a tool kit, Alan?
Thought that maybe you'd want
it, not that you need it anymore.
Go give 'em back to him.
He's down in section three.
Where he always is.
There goes Swifty!
Erin?
- Hi. I'm Nathan.
- Hi.
So, I take it this is your first time.
Yeah. You're the first suitor.
Suitor. I like that. I like that.
It's old fashioned. I'm kind
of an old-fashioned guy myself.
You, um, surprise me, frankly.
Why?
You just don't seem
like the sort of woman...
who would resort to placing an ad.
Sorry, um.
I'm sure you get that all the time.
You're a very attractive woman.
- So, you study God?
- God?
- Aren't you a divinity student?
- Yeah.
Well, God's an immense subject.
We don't have to talk about it.
I think it makes some
people uncomfortable.
No! Let's talk about God.
I'm the V.P. of Operations at
the Krylex Corporation in Waltham.
Krylex manufactures small rubber
parts for a variety of commercial...
and industrial products-- products
ranging from the small rubber helmets...
on wall-mounted spring door studs...
to the waterproof gaskets on
street newspaper vending machines.
You're starting to glaze
over. I see it. Don't worry.
Happens all the time. I'm not
offended. I'll tell you why.
It's because most people are blind
to the impact small rubber parts...
have on their daily lives.
Erin, how often do people
look under their phones?
- Um-- - Precisely. When you get
home, I'd urge you to do just that.
You'll appreciate what
I'm about to tell you.
The four small rubber nubs
that your phone rests on?
Admittedly, not very exciting.
But, consider what the consequences
would be without those rubber nubs.
You know, you don't say a lot...
but it's pretty obvious
what you're telling me.
- Really?
- Your body language says it all.
You're palming me.
I'm sorry?
You're palming me. Your
palms are exposed to me.
When a woman does that,
she's subconsciously flirting.
Yeah? What does this mean?
Oh. Tiger, hmm?
Let's just sum up here, okay? God is
definitely a woman, because only a woman...
would have the kind of compassion
necessary to create someone...
- as beautiful as you.
- Okay.
- There-there-there's one giant
hole in your argument. - Hole.
Daryl, no female deity would have had
the absence of mind to create you...
the male gender, a gender that spends all
of its time looking forward to getting off.
God is a man. Why?
Because men need women.
Women don't need men.
And yet, you're here. It's
a hole in your argument.
I collect art. South American, mostly.
Really? South American?
- Have you been?
- Yeah, my dad took me to Brazil when I was very young.
But I love-- I love
Brazilian music.
Well, I was down there for
a conference ten days ago.
My tan's
faded, but, um--
- That's it. You're playing with your hair.
- I'm bored.
Do you always deal
with people like this?
I--
Well.
It's just that I've been taking this course in
communication and trying out things I learned.
Can I just drop it, I mean, really?
- I'm just so lonely.
- I'm sorry.
I-I-I can't meet people. It's like
I've got a sign on my forehead.
Yeah, that's the--
That's the thing.
About God-- He's so hard
to pin down, at any moment.
- He?
- She.
You know, he, she, it.
As Cicero said...
"Consistency is the
hobgoblin of little minds."
Ralph Waldo Emerson, you mean.
How come you never smile?
Would that make you more comfortable?
- You don't really like me, do you?
- No! I don't like poseurs.
I mean, you're probably
a very nice person...
but I have no way of
knowing that, you know?
You're all uncomfortable,you're
telling all these strange jokes...
and why are you trying
so hard to impress me?
You would be much more appealing
if you would just be yourself.
Here, let's see. " Frisky and carefree."
- So who's the poseur?
- My mother put in that ad.
Oh, really? Well, what's her number?
Who is the real Erin Castleton?
Please stand up.
Well, uh, what would you like to know?
First I'd like to know what
attracted you to nursing.
Other people's pain.
That's funny. I like that.
No, actually I was in medical
school at Harvard, but I dropped out.
Why?
I lost,
um--
- I lost my motivation. It's a long story, anyway.
- Got all night. All morning.
Here you go, pal.
- Let me get this round.
- Refill?
- Yeah.
- Least I can do.
Uh, what the heck is that?
This is
funny. I, um--
I was married once, a
long, long, long time ago.
But, I-I carry that as a sort
of, you know, good luck charm.
Well, I guess it's not working.
I can't put this here.
I got this dry-cleaned.
Don't worry, Kev.
There's plenty of room.
Just put it
in the-- Tsk.
Aw, smells like fish, man. I'm
gonna get fish smell in my fabrics.
-Hello?
-Uh,yeah, hi. My name is Erin.
You called about my ad in the Herald.
No, I think you must want my
brother Kevin. Hold on a second.
Hey, Kev! Telephone! It's for you!
Coming!
Sorry.
I got it! Hello?
This is he. Oh, it's nice to
finally meet you, Erin, so to speak.
Yeah, you'll have to excuse
me. I'm a little out of breath.
I'm moving out of the place I'm living
in. Yeah, I'm moving to a much nicer place.
You're the most beguiling
woman I've ever met.
You don't take men's
compliments very well, do you?
- I take what I need.
- Which is?
- Another round.
- You got it. Barkeep?
- Another round for the lady, please.
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
I liked what you said
earlier about, um--
What was it? Um, sticking to your
principles and following your dreams.
But, um, do you really
believe that if you do that...
that things will just come to you
like it's-- like it's destined?
Yeah, I really do.
You know, my brother says that a lot.
You know, he says you create
your own luck, but, uh--
- You know, take me, for instance.
- No, no.
No, let's take your brother.
Okay, uh, my brother.
- What's his name?
- Alan.
- Alan.
- It's funny. When I think of Alan, I think of, uh...
what W.C. Fields said which was, uh...
"Consistency is the
hobgoblin of little minds."
No, Emerson. It was Ralph Waldo Emerson.
Well, whatever, I mean, whoever said it is
not so much important as I remembered it.
But I think of him that way because
he's always, always in his books.
- Books?
- Yeah,you know...
- Really?
- and I respect his determination.
I'm lucky, you know, because
I have more than determination.
I have determination plus talent...
plus, like, a natural intelligence...
and then sort of a street savvy
that I think I've picked up myself.
And sometimes that's hard
to deal with,you know.
'Cause you know you've
got both barrels loaded.
And sometimes you only
wanna use one, but you can't.
Uh, you know, it's funny to
me when I think about it...
because I remember back when
I was studying for the bar--
And I don't think I had to study
as hard as a lot of people--
Every night Alan was out
partying, and I'm at home...
directed, and now it's sort of weird.
Because, you know, I'm
out there. I'm grabbing.
I'm taking, you know.
I see. I want. I take.
And he just sits at home
every night and studies, so--
Puff? Oh, my God.
Freeze!
Oh.
Oh, Puff.
But I'm not lonely. I,
I like to be by myself.
I mean, people don't understand that. You
know, they, they think that you're a bitch...
or that you,you know, that you
must certainly be depressed.
I mean, say, say a woman is
sitting alone in a bar reading.
You know, a man who comes in, he
automatically makes an assumption...
that she's either sitting there
waiting to be propositioned...
and,you know, if she doesn't want it, then
there must be something wrong with her...
because,you know, what
woman in her right mind...
would be content just
sitting by herself,you know.
But I'm not lonely when I'm
sitting in a bar by myself...
and, you know, I'm not even
lonely when I'm at home alone.
I get-- You get lonely
in a crowded room...
or a subway that's packed with people.
You know, all these people
and every one a stranger.
My father-- My father had one
of those quiet Irish souls.
He was a poet.
Well, actually, he was a cardiologist,
but he wrote beautiful poetry.
He would take us to Ireland in the summers,
and he and I would take these long walks...
and then we would just sit
together staring out at the sea.
He said that if you can learn to contemplate
just one beautiful thing every day...
that it would give you
something very special.
It's a Gaelic expression.
It means, "Quietness
without loneliness."
Oh, my God. I have been
talking and talking.
It seems for hours.
Um, I'm sorry, Barry.
It's-- I think you're the
first man that I've met...
that hasn't had, like, a pathological
need to talk about himself.
Um, but anyway, let's talk about you.
- What do you do?
- I'm a therapist.
Oh, does that make
you feel uncomfortable?
Today youngsters...
throughout Boston struggled
to express their feelings...
for the fish we all called Puff.
Reporter Arnie Reisman was with
the children of the Wimble School...
and got some of their reactions.
It wasn't just another day for
the kids here at the Wimble School.
For some, it was a difficult day.
When I heard that he
got eaten by a piranha...
um, that, um, I felt like
he'd never come back again...
'cause I never saw a fish in my life.
- How does that make you feel?
- Sad.
What a shame. Thanks, Arnie.
In national news, the Tantooni
standoff in Tantooni, Arizona--
You know, a nurse. It's
like the expression, uh...
"Consistency is the
hobgoblin of little minds."
What did you just say?
Oh, I was just quoting Marx, Karl Marx.
I tend to contradict myself
a lot, you know, especially...
around, um, you know, a, uh...
you
know, a--
Hmph. You know, I'm feelin'bloated.
I'm gonna go, uh, take a pee-ski, okay?
And, uh,you want anything?
I mean, I'm sure you don't
want anything from the bathroom.
I'll just
go. Sh--
That's gonna end up in my bank account.
You forget I was watching you.
I don't think you did so well.
What are you talkin'about? I did great.
Really couldn't see too well.
- How do you think he did?
- Are you kidding?
- He struck out.
- No surprise there.
- Think she can see us?
- Nah.
She wouldn't recognize us anyways.
Hi, honey. I'm home.
- Eric?
- Yeah?
- I like you.
- I, I, I like you too.
- You're my little hobgoblin.
- Number four.
And I'd rub your head and make a wish,
but there's too many people watching.
What do you mean?
- She's touchin' him.
- No. That can't be happening.
But I'd like to be
alone with you someplace.
- Sure.
- No, not now, Eric.
Right, I mean, we should wait.
- Tomorrow night.
- That's a good time.
A little getaway I know of.
Don't tell anyone, okay?
- Yeah.
- It's just gonna be our little secret.
- You promise me?
- Right, right, absolutely. Why would I say anything?
Meet me tomorrow night, 9:30.
It is a big deal, because Puff was
more than your average balloonfish.
- She represented to the children--
- She? Did you say, "she"?
-Puff was a female,yes.
-I can't believe I gave her those notes.
- You know what I mean? Hmm?
- What?
- Talking about that girl Erin.
- Erin who? - Erin, the nurse.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, she was sharp.
She was nice. I mean, I think
she was intimidated by me.
That's probably why
she didn't call back.
Along those lines, why don't we go out to
Zanzibar tonight and pick up a couple of ladies?
You know what, I'm out tonight. I can't
do it. I'm just not feeling up to it.
- You guys go.
- I'm just gonna nuke some fish sticks tonight.
Look on the bright side. At least
you didn't lose your money to me.
Let's go out. You gotta get back up
to the plate, man. Take your whiffs.
- The prison will be privately
run and inmates charged...
- for their stay.
- Hello? Who?
- The penal system took a detour into the twilight zone...
- Hey, hey.
- No, I'm not surprised at all.
- once again, thanks to the crafty ways...
- Tonight?
- of Arty Milhous Lesser.
- It began this afternoon when the Suffolk County zoning...
- Sure, tonight's great.
- reluctantly awarded Lesser-- -9:30's
perfect. Our little secret, huh?
- Don't worry. I won't tell a soul.
- Can I get you anything else?
-Just the check.
- What are you doin'?
- Hey! Hey!
Outside!
Get goin'! Get goin'!
What are ya both of
ya doin'here,ya freaks?
Oh, don't wipe it off, Alan.
What? You didn't like it?
I mean, it's not that I didn't like
it. It just came a little unexpectedly.
Come on. You've been flirting with me
since I hired you as my tutor in September.
- You didn't hire me as your tutor, all right?
- Yes, I did.
I accepted the respon-- I'm tryin' to
help you out in the class. That's all.
- I'm doin' you a favor.
- Don't deny it, Alan.
- Did you bring my notes, by the way?
- Oh.
I forgot them, but they're home.
I'll give them to you tomorrow.
Oh, good, well, you know, that was kind
of like the point of gettin' together.
I mean, the thing is-- It's just
I'm tryin' to finish a paper tonight.
I mean, I kind of need the notes,
because that's what I took them for.
Well, this is our date. I didn't know I
was supposed to bring a bunch of papers.
It's not exactly. I mean, we were gonna get
together, and you were gonna give me the notes.
I mean, that was sort of
the point of it, I thought.
So you asked me to this
fancy restaurant on a date...
so I could bring you back your notes.
That's really nice.
You look really beautiful.
Thank you. I got dressed
up especially for our date.
You know, I wonder if
it would be possible...
not to keep using that word, okay?
You're funny.
Have you ever seen a whale
swimming around in the ocean?
No.
Maybe you'd like to go with me on this
whale watch. It's incredible out there.
I mean, first of all, it's, like,
a half hour out on the boat...
which is beautiful, and you're
looking over the expanse of the ocean.
And-- It's
a very, uh--
Romantic would be the wrong word.
Just a serene pleasant time, and I think
it'll perk up your interest in class.
- You wanna go?
- Yeah.
- All right. Well, let's see.
- So it's like another date.
No, I would say more of
a low-pressure, low-key...
kind of just a couple
of friends hanging out.
I'd really be interested
in that. Seriously.
- I read Moby Dick.
- Okay.
Paging Dr. Betcher.
Paging Dr. Betcher, please.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Paging Dr. Stateman.
Dr. Stateman, please.
Bob's gay.
- He is?
- Yeah.
He came out on our last date.
That whole macho thing-- That
was, like, this huge cover-up.
I'm sorry.
Uh, you were right. I made,
like, this huge mistake.
It's just that Bob was there, and I
thought that that was my only choice.
You know, with men there's
always-- There's a choice.
It's just a really weak selection.
The only person that can
make you happy is yourself.
I know that sounds really hokey,
but I'm finding that to be true.
Yeah. Don't you just hate men?
Oh, God, I wish I did. That
would make my life so much easier.
- Who's got the malaria patient in room 18?
- He's mine.
Oh, to have been a mosquito
upon that man's cheek. Oh.
Mr. de Silva,you're dressed?
- Yes, I-- - I need to give
you a gamma globulin shot.
Would you take off your pants, please?
- I had all my shots yesterday.
- Not this one.
-Just take off my pants?
- Yes, sir.
-Just my pants, right?
- Just your pants.
Okay.
##
You like bossa nova?
- This gonna hurt?
- It's gonna be painful sitting down for a little while.
My flight is on Friday.
Where did you contract the malaria?
It was in Bolivia. I was on expedition.
I'm a musicologist. I
collect ethnic folk songs.
I'm going to Sao Paulo for holiday.
You like my country's music, right?
- I can tell there is a little bit of Brazil in you.
- Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm. See, you are sad and happy.
You don't smile, but you are content.
You are sad and happy at the same time.
In Brazil we have a term
for that. It is saudade.
It's like melancholy,
nostalgia. It's very bossa nova.
It
means--
"Sadness has no end. Happiness does."
- I like that song.
- Yes, it's a very good song.
Listen, there's a club in Somerville that
plays Brazilian music if you are interested.
- I work the night shift.
- Well, what time do you get out?
I'm sorry. That was very forward of me.
- I do not ever, ever--
- Show me your hands.
I'm not married.
Well, you might have taken it off and put
it in your wallet. You know, men do that.
I'm not that kind of man.
My wallet just has pieces
of paper and lots of plastic.
I'm becoming a plastic person
I have so much plastic--
I get out at 7:30 in the morning.
Well, uh, my name is Andre de Silva.
And it was a pleasure having
you care for me, uh-- What?
- Erin.
- Erin. Yes.
You should have said it was a pain
in the ass. An American would have.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
I know, but I am
Brazilian, and we--
Erin.
- See ya, Alan.
- All right, Stu.
- Take care, Stu.
- All right. See ya later.
- Hey, Alan.
- Hey, Ben.
- They want to see you up in Administration.
- Yeah.
Sit down.
We're all a little distracted
because of this latest incident.
Attendance has skyrocketed
because of all this publicity.
But all the kids want to see
now is the piranha exhibit.
Poor Puff, eh?
You volunteer a lot of hours here, Alan.
It's well worth it, Miss Shebola.
We think so too. We'd like
to start paying you for them.
It's great, because I
could really use the money.
Yuri Spinov needs a part-time assistant
in Physical Plant. He recommended you.
We know it's a change from
what you've been doing.
But it will put you on staff.
Well, I'll have to just
think about it a little bit.
Of course. Let us know by Monday?
Okay.
- Oh, God.
- This is to South American men with good sweaters.
- But you should go back.
- Hmm.
You really should. The
people are so wonderful.
That spirit-- You don't
find it anywhere else.
And-- And the land. The--
The beaches are wonderful.
- Some day I will go back.
- You should go back. I'm going back.
- Yeah, why?
- This city--
It's all schools and hospitals
and bars and graveyards.
The young people here, all they
do is-- They study, and they drink.
It's terrible. I think one's
school year should be spent...
you know, by the ocean walking with
someone that they love very much...
eating fried
fish by the, uh--
Anyway, you should go
back. You should go there.
I think you should be somewhere warm.
I think it would be good for your heart.
I don't know. I-I-- I guess I feel that if
I left right now I would be running away.
Running away? I don't understand.
If you're running away, somebody's chasing
you. So what is it that's chasing you, huh?
- Uh-- - Uh, personal
business. I understand.
So let's make a toast. To perhaps the
most beautiful woman that ever lived.
- Oh, no.
- Yes, the most beautiful woman that ever lived which is you.
- Let's not confuse matters.
- And to me, the greatest man that ever lived.
Okay.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Oh, geez.
- I'm going to buy you the most expensive...
$5 bottle of wine you ever saw.
Look what I got us: a bottle
of wine and a corkscrew. Hey.
No, no, don't, don't.
I need to get some air.
I need to get out of here.
Grab your binoculars and cameras,
folks, and get up on the deck...
because in another few minutes, we'll be
entering the humpback whale feeding grounds.
What we have here is hands
down the best whale watching--
You all right?
My stomach is just,
like, wobbly, gobbly.
You know what's good. Just
look out there on the horizon.
- Where?
- The horizon would be where the land and the sea meet.
Right.Just look directly out
there and take a couple of deep--
- Okay.
- Can you breathe deeply?
Feelin' a little better now?
Huh. Whoa.
Look at that! Spectacular!
Oh, shit!
Alan, I'm really sorry.
I'm being such a drag.
I'm keeping you from watching the
fish. Why don't you just go up there?
- I'll be all right here.
- No, no, no, no.
- No, go.
- No, I wouldn't dream of it.
- No, I feel really bad. - It's
just like a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
It's not a big deal.
No, I'm just kidding.
- I'll come back out when you're feelin' better.
- Yeah?
- Without you, but I'll come back out.
- Oh, you. Tsk.
You know what. I'm really not feeling very
well. I think I should just walk myself home.
No, I-I-I think you
should stay. It's fine.
- I don't think I'm going to be very
good company right now. - No, this is--
This is the perfect company.
Look-- Look at the water.
That's very beautiful, like, like you.
See, it's-- You can be alone, but to be
alone with someone else who is alone--
Alone together--
That-- That is perfect.
- Do you know what I mean?
- I know what you mean.
- Relaxation is
everything. It's the answer.
See, what relaxes you? Tell me.
You, um-- You
like to fly, right?
- I am terrified of flying.
- Oh, perfect.
So you are in a two-seater...
and it is being flown by my father who
weighs 462 pounds, because he lost 10.
And he can't see out of
his right eye-- his left--
It changes. And the
plane goes like this.
And there's clouds inside
the plane, outside the plane.
And then all of a sudden, you're
getting sick. You're about to scream.
And then the plane just drops,
and you look out the window.
Then it clears, and there's beautiful
sunlight in the plane, and you look out...
and you see Corcovado.
- Oh!
- Ah, and the beaches, and then the plane just glides in.
The door opens, and you're there.
You relax, and it's perfect.
- It's beautiful.
- Yes, very beautiful.
So why don't you, uh, come with me...
to Sao Paulo?
- You're joking.
- No, I'm not joking.
- God! Look at your
tattoo. - Mm-hmm.
That is, like, so cool.
That's like Popeye.
It's really hard.
- You know-- You
know,Julie-- - Yeah?
Seriously, you know, I
know what you're thinking.
- And I mean--
Really, I-- - Yeah?
- What am I thinking?
- I just invited you out here...
because I wanted you to
experience this with me.
- Oh.
- All right? I'm sorry. I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
- So you don't have any desire to kiss me?
- Oh, no, no.
- You don't?
- No, of course, I have a desire to kiss you.
- But I just think it would
be best-- - I like you a lot.
Oh, I like you a lot too.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Geez--
- I will take care of everything. Visa. -
I-I-I can't believe you're asking me this.
- We're strangers.
- We are not strangers.
I have known you at least
two lifetimes that I know of.
- Oh, don't give me that bullshit, please.
- How is that bullshit?
- I know how you feel.
- I don't know what I feel.
I have to spend Thanksgiving
with my mother in Manhattan.
No, no, that's wrong.
Forget your mother.
- I love my mother. -
Yes, I love your mother--
I don't know her. When I know
her, I will love her, but--
Do this for you, darling. Please, come.
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, come for a little bit.
- I don't think this is really gonna work out like this.
- Why?
I
mean--
I-I just want this to mean something.
It means a lot to me.
I'm gonna walk myself home from here.
Listen, I leave in three days.
Three days.
I fly planes.
I was adopted. My father--
That's not my father.
I'm not going to get fat.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- You cut your hair.
- Yeah.
Uh, well, we finished the job.
We, uh, stopped them from buildin'
the dam. We saved the land...
the reservation, the river, everything.
What are you doin' in Boston?
Uh,
well--
We-- We saved the
burial grounds.
And, uh, the Tantoonis
were very grateful.
They were so grateful that they
decided to build a casino on it.
You know? It's just all about money.
You know, my heart isn't in it anymore.
It was just really lonely down there.
I really missed you, and I'm wrong.
You're the one...
who doesn't need to change.
I'm the one who needs to change.
I don't want you to change.
I mean, don't ever change.
You know what I mean.
- Come on.
- The paper.
- This better be good. Did you
spell-check this? - I spell-checked it.
- I slaved for hours.
- All right.
I'm trying to make what we've
got together mean something.
I know. It means everything.
#Stay#
#And we'll make such sweet music#
#Come hear the lovebird
He's just out my window#
#We'll hear the night sing
and I'll make a star glow##
In northern Brazil, people
who believe in Candomble...
they offer this to the
goddess of the sea, Iemanja.
Now, there is also supposed to be
fried fish. I thought better of it.
Um, what is this offering for?
Good luck.
- What is this?
- I leave tomorrow morning.
Erin, will you come with me?
You are crazy.
Yes, crazy for you.
#The time is running#
#Take everything life can give you#
#You know it's there so
take it, even fake it#
#Till it comes true##
There goes Swifty!
One, two, three.
A lot of worry about nothing. Uh,
busted blood vessel or somethin'.
Guess I gotta lighten
up on the booze, huh?
That's great, Frank. You know,
I'm really glad you're gonna live.
But actually I just
came by to give you this.
This is way more than
just one installment.
I got a part-time job,
and I'm gettin' you...
off my back once and for all, all right?
Hey, Frank, what the hell are you doin'?
Certain associates of mine really appreciated
what you did, how it all worked out.
The attendance at the aquarium
has doubled. It didn't work out.
The point is, you worked out, Alan.
And this...
is your reward.
Hey, Arty! Uh, this
is, uh, my boy, Alan.
- Alan, say hello to Mr. Lesser.
- It's good to finally meet ya.
Frankie's told me a lot about
ya. He said you were a student.
You look like you've been out of short
pants for a while now. What are you, 40, 41?
- No, I'm 3 5.
- 35, huh?
You're at a pivotal
junction in your life, Alan.
It's good to have you aboard.
Greyhounds now
entering the--
Frankie, we got a wacko down on
the new waterfront place there.
Come on! He's makin'
waves. Do somethin'.
Or maybe use this new
guy here? Send him down.
I'll get on it right away, Mr. Lesser.
Number Five, Satin Flame, 70 pounds.
Number Six, Burden's Drought, 73.
Number Seven, It Is Gently, 7 2.
Number Eight,Jar Man, 75.
- Hello?
- Erin, hi.
- It's me. Are you packing?
- Hi.
- Oh, my sweet.
- Yeah, I'm packing.
You know, I want to come
over and help you pack.
- We should pack together.
- Um, no, no, no, don't.
I'm sorry, darling. I
get so eager to see you.
I'll see you at the airport tomorrow.
I'll be there in the morning.
What does that mean?
Ah, what this
means, darling--
It means, "I want your love for me.
The two of us like this until the end.
I do not want sadness anymore.
I will make you happy...
and destiny is what tells me this."
Erin, I will make you smile.
I swear I will, Erin.
So, uh, tomorrow at the airport, right?
- Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good, and, please, a small bag.
All you need is toothpaste
and a little two-piece--
Puff?
What time your train is
gonna arrive tomorrow?
Oh, it's gonna be so fabulous.
Everybody's gonna be there.
Everybody is dying to see you.
Dodge is gonna be there.
Brazil, wow. Does that
sound beautiful, huh?
I hear that's beautiful this
time of the year. Brazil.
That's way past Medford, Brazil.
- What time's your flight?
- 9:35.
- You're not gonna make it.
- I'm sorry?
You're not gonna make
it. The tunnel is jammed.
Oh, I have to make it.
The tunnel is clogged.
All right, um-- All right, take me
to Bowdoin Station, the Blue Line.
Airport Station next.
Change here for the airport
terminal shuttle. Next stop, Airport.
This is Airport Station.
Excuse me.
I'm trying to get out of here.
Why don't you just knock me down?
Come on!
This is Airport Station.
Change here for the
airport terminal shuttle.
This is Airport Station.
Change here for the Logan
Airport terminal shuttle.
Wonderland Station will be next.
Next stop, Wonderland.
Headset?
- In-flight movie?
- Yes. Thank you.
- Headset?
- Uh,yes, please.
- In-flight movie? - None for
me, thanks, and none for the lady.
- Headset?
- Yes.
So-- You are
traveling alone?
- Yes.
- Mmm.
And you?
Uh, yes.
It seems... always alone.
You travel for business?
No, no, uh, for pleasure.
Ah! Pleasure.
Well, you must like my
country's music then.
Yes, I do.
That's beautiful, but what does it mean?
Ah, what this
means-- May I?
It means this, darling.
#So close your eyes#
#For that's your lovely way to be#
#Aware of things your heart alone#
#Was meant to see#
- Over there?
- Right over here.
#The fundamental loneliness goes#
#Whenever two can
dream a dream together##
- Feelin' a little better?
- Yeah, a little. Thanks. I--
- This way. - I'm
sorry about that. I--
- No, no, no. That's-- That's
totally all right. - I think I just--
I just needed some air or something.
- The train was so crowded.
- I know, yeah. I mean, that Airport Station is horrible.
- People are, like, shoving.
- Yeah.
They're in such a rush
to get outta there.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
Yeah, my father used to bring
us to this beach all the time.
I still come here every
day to read or relax.
Do you? Every day, that's so nice.
Well, I think it's important to have
some daily ritual in your life...
that gives it a sense
of consistency, you know?
C-C-Consistency?
Yeah.
But, uh, um, wouldn't
you say that, uh...
"Consistency is the, uh,
hobgoblin of little minds"?
Well, actually, it's:
"A foolish consistency...
is the hobgoblin of little minds."
- That's Ralph Waldo Emerson.
- Waldo Emerson, right.
But I don't think coming to a place
like this every day is foolish.
No. No, not at all.
Because I think it's important
sometimes just to sit in a quiet place...
and stare out at
the sea and just--
Contemplate something beautiful.
It's funny, though.
I never realized such a beautiful
beach was so close to Boston.
Well, it's not always this nice.
Um--
Well, I guess I better get home.
- You wanna take a walk?
- I'd love it.
- Great.
- Okay.
Ah, it's right down here.
