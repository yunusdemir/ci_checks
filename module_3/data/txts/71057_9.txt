Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday to you.
Happy Birthday,
dear Chantelle...
- That's so pretty.
- Sorry.
Happy Birthday to you.
Tickle monster.
Oh, it's your birthday, Chantelle.
Dada loves you so much, so much...
You look so cute.
Happy Birthday, love.
- Oh, man, all right. I gotta go,
I gotta go. - Mhm-mm.
So hard... Let me get out of here.
Go... All right, bye, bye, bye.
Bye.
Whoa!
It's somebody's birthday!
Today...
Today Mommy gets her life back.
Just wish me luck.
Don't miss me too much!
There you go.
Here you go, Sir.
- Hey, Nicky!
- Hey!
Hey! So, did you open the envelope?
We decided that
we were gonna be surprised.
Well, you know, in the old days,
you didn't have a choice.
You had to wait.
- Very long time ago, but...
- What?
I can't make it to the baby shower.
So, I thought I would bring this to you.
Thank you!
- Karen, you got her coffee?
- Sure do!
- Thank you.
- Have a really good time.
- Thank you. I wish you could be there.
- Me too, me too.
- Here you go, Mitz.
- Thank you, darling.
- All right, kids. Bye.
- Bye.
Jeffrey, I'm sure you're aware
there's no smoking in here.
I used to have three
floors in this building.
You got an ashtray?
You see?
- I can be reasonable.
- Good.
Well, are we or are we not going
to execute this divorce agreement today?
Can I - can I, please,
just have a moment with my wife?
Seriously?
So, this is what you
brought us in here for?
Eight o'clock this morning,
go through this again?
Come on, Lloyd!
We're talking about 17 years.
What's one more day?
- Yeah, give us a moment. It's OK.
- All right. It's your call.
Mr. Cage, I highly
advise you to, please,
not blindside us with
something we can't fix later.
Come on. You heard the man.
Give them their time.
- We'll be outside.
- Thank you.
Really, Jeffrey?
You're gonna do this in the ninth hour?
It's the eleventh.
What?
You're supposed to say the
eleventh hour, not the ninth.
Are you kidding me?
Is this some big joke to you?
Come on, you used to love
my sense of humor.
Yeah, you used to be funny.
Don't... don't make me do
the weekend-Dad thing, please, Eve.
Oh, my God, Jeffrey.
You hardly spend time with JJ as it is.
You were away for business
when he was born.
You were in Toronto when
he took his first steps.
In Hong-Kong when he
said his first words.
In San Francisco for
his first day at school.
- Shall I continue?
- I'd rather you didn't.
All right. So, then sign
the damn papers,
and let's get on with this.
Why do you think I work all the time?
I do it for him.
I do it for us.
Jeffrey, there is no more us.
Then, why are you still
wearing your ring?
Bad habit.
Hey, Eddie, are you there?
Copy! It's Stu, pick up!
No, man.
This is Eddie's sister, Edwina.
How are you?
Sammy up on 36th is having trouble
with his lock again.
Can you see what's going on?
Copy!
He's having trouble with the lock?
Or that he forgot his damned keys again?
Don't fuck with my balls.
Bring your tools, get the case.
Oh, and the toilet on
43rd is having issues.
Come on, buddy, are you kidding me?
I just unclogged that yesterday.
Well, you're gonna have
to unclog it again.
Copy?
Yeah, funny. You know,
I probably should take a picture
of whatever I find and I'm
gonna send it to your ass.
Get back to me when
your shit don't stink, <i>amigo</i>.
When my shit don't stink.
One cup of coffee. One cup of coffee!
<i>¿Puedo tomar un cafeíto, por favor?</i>
<i>Por la mañana,
por lo menos, coño, carajo.</i>
Whoo!
Well...
You know how sometimes
you just don't wanna get out of bed?
- Yeah.
- That was me today.
- Whoo, so...
- You're late.
I know I'm late.
Everything OK?
Yeah.
- I don't have to think about anything?
- No. - All right.
Good, good, good, good.
Nice.
All right.
- I see you!
- Where are your guys now?
I think my Mets are 71 and 73.
- We're almost playing 500.
- Mhmm.
My Yanks are 85 and 57.
When are you gonna come
to the pin stripes?
When you pay me my 100 dollars, sonny.
- OK, probably tomorrow...
- Aha.
Right after I hit the trifecta,
you'll see.
OK, Scarlett.
Actually, you sounded more like Annie.
"Tomorrow, tomorrow,
I pay you... tomorrow."
- I heard of her.
- Mhm-mm.
Look! It's Captain Crapper.
You're lucky I'm a little out of shape
and don't kick your ass, Charlie.
A little? Hey, buddy, you ain't
seen a push-up in 20 years.
Try 25, Frankie.
My mistake.
Hey, we're still on for Thursday?
You gotta ask?
Have I ever missed poker night?
Poker?
What about pizza night?
I love pizza night,
you know that.
Are you kidding me?
You know I'll show up to that anytime.
- Frankie. - Yeah.
- You wanna hold it for a second?
I gotta tie my shoe.
Oh! As a matter of fact, I gotta go.
<i>We hanged out together
on Thursday night</i>
<i>at a fashion show
and she'll be joining us this morning</i>
<i>to tell us about
a personal style show</i>
<i>that she is hosting
and producing and</i>
<i>and it's called "Tracey Ullman's
Visible Panty Lines."</i>
<i>You have a wonderful evening.
Katie Rolson...</i>
<i>We're gonna have more about
our week-long special series</i>
<i>on living longer,
living better, after the age of 50.</i>
<i>This morning we'll focus on the...</i>
Excuse me.
- Sorry, Sir.
- You're fine.
Oh, shit, this one is going up.
You really don't have
to walk me to my car.
I'm perfectly capable of
getting there myself.
It's something a good husband does.
Oh, and that's supposed to be you,
all of a sudden?
Hey!
OK, what time is your
Mum coming through?
I'll be there like 15 minutes
or something like 15 minutes
after she gets way there.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello? Hello? Hello?
Damn!
That's me.
Not a cloud in the sky!
Have a good day, everyone!
Wait!
Is this one going down?
At some point.
I'll take the next one.
Perfect.
Shit!
What the fuck was that?
What the hell was that?
Oh, man.
Where are my elevators?
What the hell?
Come on.
Jeffrey, what's going on?
I don't have a clue.
- Maybe a wire cable snapped.
- No, no, I heard something.
- Something like an explosion.
- Let me try here.
Metzie!
Hello?
Metzie? Come on, girlfriend.
Hello?
- Something's wrong with our...
- Alan, come, check this out.
Is anybody there?
Can anybody hear me?
Damn!
What's going on?
- Metzie, did you feel that?
- Yeah, what was it?
- They say a small engine plane
hot the building. - Come on.
Fire Department is
trying to figure it out.
Look.
Half my elevators are not working.
Nothing on the comms is working at all.
Try rebooting
the communications...
- I did that.
- Well, try it again.
Well, how many times should I do it?
I'm telling you. Look at the board.
- They'll come up!
- Look at the board!
Where are you going?
I'm going to see what's going on.
Son of a...
Metzie? Metzie, come on, baby girl!
Who is Metzie?
Metzie is the
elevator dispatcher.
She's usually yelling in despair when
it comes to her elevators. Metzie!
- All the circuits are busy.
- I can't get no reception either.
Intercom is down.
All the cell towers are jammed.
What are you thinking?
Why do so many people need
to make calls at the same time?
If it is a broken cable,
can we fall?
That only happened once, in 1945.
Empire State Building
got hit by a B-25 bomber,
the elevator fell roughly
80 storeys, but...
- A lady survived.
- Survived?
80 storey fall?
That's bullshit.
Were you a witness?
In '45? Sure, I look great for my age,
don't you think?
How did she make it?
Apparently, she laid on the floor,
her back and didn't break a single bone.
It was a miracle.
<i>Un milagro.</i>
Well, perhaps, I think of it
more as random...
Besides, all these modern
elevators have brakes
in case something
like that happens.
- How do we know this one...?
- Because they all do!
He reads a lot.
How much?
Six newspapers a day.
Even on Sundays.
The crosswords.
I gather you guys know each other?
Well, I got a piece of paper at
home that says we're married.
Oh, really? You're gonna do this?
See?
She's got an attorney who's
trying to say that we're not.
You don't have to do that.
That's so sad.
You two seem like a good match.
- We are.
- We're not.
- So, erm, Eddie...
- Fuck!
You look like someone who knows
his way around this building.
- Yeah, but...
- How long have you been working here?
I've been working here 20 years.
I'm a custodial engineer.
A janitor?
Excuse me. My official title:
Custodial Engineer. OK, buddy?
OK, OK, so much do you actually know
about the elevators in this building?
I know they go up and I know
they go down. That's about it.
All right, try... anybody wanna give
me a hand? Try to prop the doors open?
I'll help you out.
I don't know why but...
Careful!
Nah, it feels like
it's stuck on something.
That's probably what it was,
they have a lock on it.
What? What does that mean?
Some of the elevators, they have locks
that prevent the doors from opening.
A lock engages when
the elevator's disabled.
Or in-between landings.
Why would they want us
to be stuck in here?
Some insurance issue?
It's part of the training you get
when you work here.
No one is supposed to encourage
people to climb out of these things.
The protocol is, you wait for help.
That's the insurance part.
That way nobody
will fall down the shaft.
Wait, so - so, we can't unlock it.
Are we stuck in here?
I don't think so, I mean,
I don't know.
I don't see how we could open this
from the inside anywhere, I mean...
that's the whole idea, right?
All right, everyone...
I'm freaking out.
I don't do well in small places.
- None of us do.
- OK, just look at me, just breathe.
You gotta breathe. Look at me.
Calm down. Calm down. Whatever you do...
- What do you say... should
we give a shot? - Ready? - Yeah.
Wait, wait, wait, you just said
the reason why this thing is locked.
So, can't we just like wait for the
people to come and get us out of here?
I mean, I know it's terrible,
but we've only been in here
for like a few minutes.
Let me get this straight,
the dude that rides a
bicycle all over Manhattan is the dude
that's now making safety an issue here?
You understand?
That's the dude I am.
Guys, could we please
not do the dude thing?
Listen, we gotta stay calm, OK?
Someone will come... I think...
I'm sorry, what is your name?
Michael.
- Michael. Hi, I'm Eve. - Hello.
- This is Jeffrey.
- You are...?
- Tina. - OK.
- You know I'm Eddie, so... - Yes.
- We just have to keep calm, you guys.
Look, guys, I think we're just
gonna have to wait this out.
That's all we have to do.
Because some insurance.
- Yeah. - Thank you.
- Exactly.
- Thanks.
- Yeah. OK.
So, what floor are we on, exactly?
Let's see. I got on the 35th floor...
Went up a little bit,
I wanna say,
we're somewhere between the 38th,
37th floor, around there, that's it.
Anybody want one?
Helps to relax?
No, I'm good.
<i>As Matt just mentioned, we have a
breaking news story to tell you,</i>
<i>that apparently,
a plane has just crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center
here in New York City,</i>
Nora, come here.
I need you to take all of this,
take it right to them now.
We need a supervisor here!
Is there a supervisor?
Guys, we got 32 elevators off the grid.
All of 'em upper floors are gone.
No security cameras anywhere.
I did manage to find two folks,
in shaft 6 on floors 8-13.
All right, we got an inferno on
the North Tower on 90 and above.
Can any of my guys take the elevators?
You cannot take the elevators.
They are down.
Nothing is working.
- 90 floors of stairs?
- 90 floors.
There's gotta be a better way.
I'm sorry, guys,
I don't have it for you.
But you just gotta do
what you can do.
All right, we'll make do.
Tell the captain we're going 90.
- We're taking the stairs. Go!
- We are taking the stairs!
- Argh!
- What's wrong? Fuck!
- Fuck!
- Hey!
- Come on!
- What's going on?
You gotta tell us what's
going on in here, Eddie.
I'm fine!
Yo, what is going on in here, man?
Jeffrey, what's going on?
We're OK, we're OK.
D'you hear that?
Shit.
That was very interesting.
I think I'll take you up on...
taking one of those.
I don't think I need to remind you
about the last three times you took...
prescription meds?
What happened?
I'm allergic to them.
I break out in air bags, OK?
Totally different situation.
OK.
Were you here in '93?
My friend Paulie got hurt pretty bad.
Man, I started riding in '93.
That was just crazy.
Intercom's dead,
the phone lines are down,
the noises, the shock wave...
I thought about that.
- Really?
- What?
Yes, they won't... they won't
say anything about it.
Wait, what happened in '93?
A group of jihadists drove a van
into the basement of the North Tower,
about a thousand pounds
of explosives on board.
Yeah, six people died.
Hundreds got hurt.
My friend Paulie lost his leg.
The bad guys thought
if they detonated the bomb,
the North Tower would
topple and the South...
Bring them both down.
Look, I understand how
we're all feeling.
I understand the protocol...
but my gut is telling me...
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of here, now.
Fuck this shit.
Shit.
- You wanna give me a hand, please.
- You got it.
We gotta push it one more time.
Come on. One, two...
- Come on! Come on, come on!
- Christ!
Two, three.
Harder!
It's not moving.
- Fuck!
- Fuck!
This - is - M...
Can - anybody - hear - me? Hello?
Mitzie? It's Eddie!
Eddie!
Where the hell are you?
Man, I am so happy to hear your
voice right now, listen...
Mitzie, we're on the 38th,
37th floor somewhere...
in the North Tower...
What the fuck is going on out there?
Baby, you're not gonna believe this...
Some fool hit the tower
with, like a little propeller plane
or something.
Get the fuck out of...
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm telling you the truth.
Somebody hit the damned thing
with a little plane.
Oh, shit!
Is there a lot of damage?
I don't know, baby,
I don't know.
It's... I'm sort of... I don't know.
It hit the 90th floor.
All the elevators seem to be down.
I'm watching a live feed, erm...
Outside the building and I can
tell you it doesn't look good.
Listen, there's five of us in here,
including me,
we're all good right now.
Well, do you have any water?
Any stuff to drink?
- I got this.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we got some water...
And a Granola bar.
I'm just saying, you know, it might
take a little while to get to you.
- Excuse me. Let me talk to her.
- Yeah, go on.
Metzie? Yeah, hi, this is Jeffrey Cage.
Oh, if it is Jeffrey Cage, Sir.
How are you?
We'll, I'd be a lot better with a sense
of time and when to expect some help.
I think the first order of
business is going to be...
getting the flames contained.
I think once they do that,
they can do everything else but,
they have to go to 90 something
to put the flames out,
so you're just gonna have to sit tight.
What?
So, are you saying that not one single
elevator is operational at this point?
No, Sir, what I'm saying is not one
single elevator is operational yet.
That's what I'm saying... Yet.
I don't understand.
What does that mean?
Metzie, we're gonna hang
here tight, all right?
Just do me a favor, please, please,
just get somebody up here
as soon as you can, OK?
- I will baby, and... Eddie?
- Yeah?
Don't forget you owe me money, OK?
Yeah, OK.
All right.
So, guys, this is great, right?
I mean...
We're getting out of here.
She's sending help. It's great.
Yeah.
Yeah, but didn't she say
they need to contain the fires first?
Yeah, it's gonna take
the fire-fighters all day,
go up and down the stairs, all day.
And we're talking about what?
A minute a floor?
We're looking at an hour
and a half, maybe two,
just when they make
it to the flames.
You know, I'm not
worried about it.
We got billionaire Jeffrey Cage
in the elevator,
they're gonna be stepping on it
to get him out.
You mean, get us out?
Well, I'm just saying, you know,
membership in your club has privileges.
- Whatever it takes, right?
- Right.
- Yeah, man.
- Right.
You know, I remember seeing you around.
You probably don't remember me but,
I remember you.
The king of Wall Street, man,
you were the shit, Mr. Cage. Yeah, man.
- Thank you.
- Making money hand over fist.
Yeah, man, that's pretty cool, well.
- I'm sorry we have to meet this way.
- Me too.
- I'm just gonna chill out over here,
with me, I... - OK. Thank you.
How in the hell does that happen?
How do rationally crash a plane
into one of the largest
buildings in New York City?
Excuse me.
Jeffrey.
Can we just do this?
I need you to sign this.
I just do.
Really?
In here?
Right now?
Why not?
We're not going anywhere.
You can't run away.
What difference does it make?
All these people know
our business anyway.
Even though just like all your
friends do? I mean, Christ,
even Nancy knew you were
filing before I did.
Women are gonna talk
to her friends first
before she makes any
big life decisions.
Excuse me?
Sorry.
Come on.
The writing was on
the wall for years.
You should have slowed down
long enough to read it.
OK, OK, great. Fine.
OK, so...
Tell me. What does it say?
OK, it says...
I'm tired of fighting with you.
I'm tired of feeling
lonely all the time.
I'm tired of looking into our son's
sad little face, full of disappointment
because his father is not there again.
And I have to explain to him,
why not.
Why isn't he sharing his life with him?
Why isn't he here?
I can't do it.
I really can't do it.
You gotta do this for us, please.
I promise you,
all of that is going to change.
Yeah. I've heard this before.
And I believed it
the first 100 times.
I'm sorry, I just... I don't have
any belief left in me anymore.
You guys - you guys are so lucky
you get to fight in one language.
At home, my wifey...
She cut that to me in
Spanish and in English.
Let me tell you something.
Don't ever get a Puerto Rico
girl mad at you, nah...
She starts with all
that Spanglish stuff...
Untranslatable, trust me, OK?
I'm not kidding on that.
What do you fight about?
Oh, what don't we fight about?
Kids, money, work...
my girlfriend from the ninth grade.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I'm not saying I don't love her.
I mean, shit, I've been with her
for what... 23 years? Yeah, 23 years.
I mean, that alone,
reserves her a space in Heaven.
You know...
These are my kids right here...
David.
That's Christian and Jane.
My little princess right there,
she's nine.
What I wouldn't do for them.
Mr. Cage, you got any kids?
JJ.
He's eight.
What about you, mystery man?
You got any kids?
Yap.
Boys? Girls?
Girl.
Actually, today it's her birthday
and we had a party
planned out for her and everything,
but as you can see,
I'm stuck in a Goddamn
elevator with y'all, so...
What's her name?
Chantelle.
That's a beautiful name.
Maybe they'll get us out of here
and you'll still make it in time.
Please, please, please, stop.
I get it.
I don't mean no disrespect to you,
no disrespect, but...
It's OK, I know something
about missing birthdays, so...
I'm OK.
<i>The area is swarmed
with emergency vehicles,</i>
<i>- And sirens...
- Have you seen...?</i>
<i>Obviously we're very sensitive to this
kind of thing in this neighborhood.</i>
<i>Ellie, have you...?
Of course, because of the incident</i>
<i>that occurred in the early 1990's.</i>
<i>Have you seen any...</i>
<i>any evidence, Elliott, of people
being taken out of the building?</i>
<i>You say that emergency vehicles
are there, understandably so...</i>
<i>But of course, the major concern
is human loss. I mean...</i>
<i>do you know if there were
many people in the building?</i>
<i>Another one just hit!
Something else just hit!</i>
Metzie!
Metzie, what the hell is that?
Metzie!
<i>From what would appear...
there it is right there.</i>
<i>Diana, looking from
the South to the North...</i>
<i>The one on the right...</i>
Stand by.
<i>It was at least a 727.</i>
<i>I think it was a jet.
I just couldn't believe my eyes.</i>
<i>Approximately right above me.</i>
<i>And now, you have to move from
talk about a possible accident,</i>
<i>to talk about
something deliberate...</i>
<i>that has happened here.</i>
<i>We're going to immediately check
with Air Traffic Control in the area</i>
<i>and find out of they had contact
with either of these planes...</i>
<i>before the accident.</i>
<i>So, what we've just seen,
it's about the most shocking</i>
<i>video tape I've ever seen.</i>
Eddie?
Yeah?
Listen, baby,
I - I need you...
to try to get the hell
out of that elevator.
What happened to the help
you said was coming?
I think their hands are full.
What do you mean their hands are full?
Baby, I think we're under attack.
What?
'93, guys.
Listen, have you tried
opening the doors?
Yeah.
I think we got one
of the new ones with a lock.
Oh, what about the hatch?
There's a hatch on the roof.
There's an escape
hatch on the roof.
Did you try that?
No hatch!
I mean...
There is!
It's there!
It's behind the roof's paneling.
Just... it's probably locked.
But if you get up there,
you might be able to get it open.
All right, wait, wait...
How am I supposed to get it... how?
Listen to me.
I'm telling you.
You need to get out of the elevator.
You understand me?
Get out of the elevator.
Metzie!
Metzie!
When you say under attack...
What the hell does
that actually mean?
The explosion you felt...
was from the South Tower.
It was from another plane.
And not by accident, man.
On purpose.
Holy shit!
- OK, OK...
- Holy shit!
Call Frankie on his cellphone!
I've been calling him.
I've been calling him.
He was here for a few minutes
and then he went out to try,
to see what was going on.
And I ain't seen him since
but I'm still calling him.
Who is Frankie?
OK, Frankie - Frankie,
he's the elevator supervisor,
he knows his way in and out of them.
He knows everything about this shit.
OK, OK, Metzie, listen, listen...
We're gonna try to figure this out.
OK, we're gonna try to figure this out.
Just, please, please,
get in touch with Frankie.
All right?
We're gonna try
to figure this out in here.
- OK, OK. I'll get back to you.
- Keep your eyes looking.
- There you go.
- I got it!
- Push it, push it.
- OK!
- Yes!
- OK. All right.
OK, right there.
All right.
I think I could get to that guy.
Is that the - the...?
- Can I get a hand, please?
- Yeah.
- OK, OK.
- You should take that off, bro.
Take that off. Come on.
Here we go.
All right.
We got you here.
OK, wait, wait.
I'll go in the front.
OK. Ready?
Here we go, one...
Wait, wait, move over a little bit.
Ready? One, two...
- OK, I think I can get this.
- I got it.
- It won't open? Can you open it?
- Give me that mallet.
- The what?
- The mallet. The hammer!
OK. OK.
Harder!
Open up this shit!
Son of a bitch!
Bitch! OK, OK!
OK, OK, OK!
Eve, Eve, in my back pocket
there's a knife. Take it out!
- Yeah, yeah.
- Right there. - I got it.
I got it. I'm opening it for you.
Here, here, it's open, it's open.
OK. All right.
Anything, Eddie?
Feel anything?
D'you hit anything?
Come on, Eddie, what'd you got?
- Anything?
- I don't know.
Damn it! OK, OK... let me down.
Easy! Easy!
- You're OK?
- My knee, my knee.
Wait, wait, wait, guys.
Are you hearing this?
Oh, man.
She's talking to us.
She's not happy.
Who is?
The building.
All right, maybe we should empty
everything on to the floor,
drop our pockets, purses, everything...
Why?
I don't know why! Maybe one
of us has something we can use.
I got water...
I got...
Shit! I got shit!
I got shit!
This is envelopes, not...
I got a bunch of losing,
fricking tickets.
Nail file?
- How big?
- Small?
I got some mints.
Oh, man.
What if we make some noise?
All right, then.
Let's make some noise.
- Help!
- Help!
Can you hear us?
- Help!
- Help!
- Help!
- Help!
Anybody?
Help!
Help!
Help!
Hello!
He...!
<i>Here on this side,
through the building</i>
<i>and then went into the upper floors
of the World Trade Center Tower.</i>
<i>One of us just mentioned that when
the impact hit the first tower,</i>
<i>one would hope that the people
who were in the second tower...</i>
Metzie!
- Yeah, got for Metzie.
- Did you get a hold of Frankie?
No! Nearly all of the
elevator mechanics
were evacuated once the
second tower got hit.
What about the channel?
Did you try the channel?
You think I haven't tried that?
I've tried everything. Listen...
There is so much chaos down here,
it's not even funny.
People are jumping.
They're jumping off the buildings?
Oh, my God.
I told the firemen where you are.
They know exactly where you are.
And so, as soon as they get to you,
they'll be able to take care of it.
I mean, listen,
every department from all
over the City, is here...
trying to figure this out.
I just need you to hang in there.
Hang in there? What the fuck
do you mean hang in there?
That's all we do hanging in here.
Where's the help, lady?
We need help!
OK? We need help!
- We have to get out of here.
- OK, guys, guys, please!
Please, let's stay focused.
Now, why is this Frankie
guy and all the...
all the mechanics so
Goddamn important?
Because they're the only
ones that work these things.
We need them to release the locks.
OK, OK, so...
We don't need them
to release the lock,
we need information
inside their heads...
to release the lock.
Frankie, Frankie, Frankie...
Frankie's office!
Frankie's office! He's got all the
manuals up there along the wall.
Wait, say that again?
Frankie's office.
The manuals to how these things work,
are right there behind his desk!
Oh, shit! You're in a new elevator.
Hang tight, hang tight!
They're in a new elevator.
Retrofitted. Nobody knows.
Damn! I gave them bad information.
Shit!
What floor are we on, Mike?
Actually, we just passed the 16th...
Keep going, guys!
Keep moving!
I hope she finds those manuals, man.
D'you think she will find them?
Honestly, I don't know.
She gotta make it all the way down
to maintenance floor...
and then back up.
It might be a while
before she gets back to us.
I don't wanna die today.
Nobody's gonna die.
Nobody's gonna die on me,
now, you hear me?
You're gonna get through this.
We're all gonna get through this.
- Hey!
- What?
Whose phone is that?
Whose phone is that?
- Shit! My phone!
- Monty, where is he?
It's my phone.
Yeah, I got it!
Fuck! Where is it?
Eve! Find it!
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Hello?
- Eve, where are you?
- Oh, Mom, hi!
Where the hell are you?
Are you in that building?
Yeah, just... listen,
we're still in the North Tower.
All right?
And we're stuck...
How's JJ doing?
He's fine.
Are you together?
Yes, we're technically
still married.
Her Mom always liked me.
Can you, please, have her
call my wife for me?
Yes! Mom...
Me too.
Me too.
Mom, listen to me.
I need you to concentrate.
Get a pen and a paper.
You're gonna write down some numbers.
Yes, of course, of course.
Let me find some paper.
So, OK, hang on.
Hang on, sweetie.
OK, go.
You got it?
Yeah, hold on.
212-356-5567. I'm Michael.
My wife's name is Holly.
OK, Michael.
Yeah, Eddie...
and my number is 212-773-2755
and my wife's name is Gloria.
OK, I got it.
OK.
I'm OK.
No one?
Anything else?
Mom, can you put JJ
on the phone, please?
Of course, he's right here.
JJ.
Mom?
- Hi! Hi, sweetheart!
- Hey, buddy!
Mom and Dad, are you guys watching this?
Dad's old building's on fire.
Yeah, yeah, buddy, we're...
we're watching on television.
Will the firemen put the fire out?
Yeah, of course, they will.
That's what they do, kiddo.
Listen, baby, I need you to do
something for me. You - you...
You have to stay inside. OK?
You and Nana have
to stay at home.
I don't want you to go anywhere.
All right?
- We were gonna go to the park.
- JJ, your mother said to stay put.
We'll find something to do.
We're not moving until we see them
right in front of us.
Come home soon, OK?
I love you, guys.
I love you more, buddy.
I love you so much, ahm...
Be good. Can you put Nana
on the phone for a second, please?
Here you go.
Eve?
Mom? Will you please
put on one of your shows?
I don't want him watching this
shit on TV. D'you understand?
And...
Listen, you have to make sure you give
him his medication. If he needs it...
Eve?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Shit!
The thing...!
It's OK.
It's OK.
What if she doesn't give him his thing?
He's got...
Oh, my God.
- OK. It's gonna be OK, right?
- Yes.
OK.
I'm sorry.
<i>Is President Bush to arrive there, Bob?</i>
<i>Well, Katie, he's
coming back directly,</i>
<i>as you figure, it's about
a two hour flight.</i>
<i>So, you can do the Math...</i>
<i>The reason I said that
it was so surreal was that...</i>
<i>within a... just about 20 minutes ago,
they were still conducting tours.</i>
<i>You had hordes of tourists
and others still in the White House,</i>
<i>on tour, lining up outside to get in,</i>
<i>there seemed to be absolutely no unu...</i>
Oh, God!
Yes! Thank you, God!
Thank you, thank you...
<i>And today we've had a national tragedy.</i>
<i>Two airplanes have crashed
into the World Trade Center...</i>
<i>in an apparent terrorist
attack on our country.</i>
<i>I have spoken to the Vice-President,</i>
<i>to the Governor of New York,
to the director of the FBI,</i>
<i>and I've ordered that the full
resources of the Federal Government,</i>
<i>go to help the victims
and their families.</i>
<i>And to conduct a full
scale investigation,</i>
<i>to hunt down...
and to find those folks...</i>
<i>who committed this act.</i>
<i>Terrorism against our
Nation will not stand.</i>
<i>And now, if you join me
in a moment of silence...</i>
<i>May God bless the victims,
their families, and America.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
OK.
You guys better get home.
Call your families,
let them know you're all right.
Go on now. I got it. I got this.
I just have to talk to them.
Go ahead, man.
So...
my doctor this morning...
he said that he was gonna need a...
a urine sample and,
one sample is too simple,
And I said, you know what?
Why don't you just take my underwear?
Take my underwear?
- No?
- No.
Jeffrey... really?
Are you gonna do that now?
Mr. Cage, you have jets and stuff?
No, I don't have jets and stuff.
What is with you and money?
I just don't have money like that.
That's all.
Well, unless you're an airline,
it's a little excessive. They have...
more than one jet.
But you have a jet?
Who gets the jet?
- That... I get to keep.
- Of course, you do.
Can it make it all the way to Hawaii?
That depends on where you leave from.
If we left from here, we'd have to...
stop in Los Angeles to refuel.
See, I always wanted to go to Hawaii,
I promised my wife,
for our tenth wedding anniversary,
but, yeah...
I guess that we'll never
have that kind of cash, so...
We go to Orchard Beach.
Yeah.
What happened?
Did you lose it all?
I guess you could say that.
How much?
That depends on who I'm lying to.
What are we talking?
Tables? Sports? Ponies?
All of them. A few tough beats,
you know.
Start looking around...
Next thing, I'm hiding
from my bookie at the race track.
And all I'm think is like, yo...
I'm gonna double my daughter's
college fund with this one bet,
walk into my house, with a big stack,
be this hero...
Yeah.
I mean, that's what I'm always thinking
in my mind, you know, a hero...
It's just that it never
goes down like that.
So...
Well, you're still chasing it.
Jeez, isn't that what we're all doing?
Chasing that big brass ring?
Not me.
Don't kid yourself, <i>mi hija...</i>
That's what people in this whole
city are doing all the time, OK?
No, please. You don't know me.
You don't know anything about me.
I came here today
to tell him it was over.
Your boyfriend?
I wouldn't have called him that.
He's far from being a boy and he
sure as shit isn't my friend.
Is he good-looking, at least?
Boy, say he's older, a lot older.
The silver fox type?
He's definitely not a ten,
but neither am I.
Oh...
To me you're... you're a ten. Oh, yeah.
Are you hitting on me?
Is this you fucking
hitting on me, Eddie?
'Cos you've had your eyes all over me
since you got in this elevator,
- Tina! - Don't think I haven't noticed.
- What? - Calm down.
That's not what's happening here.
And sweetheart, do I have to remind
you have had a couple of go's?
Sure! It's the pills.
It's not the pills.
It doesn't matter what it is,
it's nice to go out to dinners,
and buy nice clothes and have a
sweet apartment in downtown.
But in the end, you don't own any of it.
None of it.
It owns you.
He... owns you.
Shit, it's gonna sound awful, but...
he's up there, and I'm here, and...
part of me just hopes
this son of a bitch dies.
What?
What? We're going around the room now?
It's my time?
No, I pass.
No thank you.
I mean, I love my wife,
I love my baby girl...
You know, I ain't having no affairs,
I ain't having no sugar mammas,
I have no gay shit going on,
None of that. You guys can relax.
You know, with me,
what you see is exactly what you get.
So... relax.
How did you hurt your knee?
I'm a messenger,
I'm a bike messenger in New York City,
I mean, shit happens, I'm not
sitting in the back of no...
black limousine, like you.
Did you get hit?
Yeah, hit-and-run cabbie.
Pakistani motherfucker too.
So, if it was a hit-and-run,
then how did you know where he was from?
Hey, man, I just know,
I mean, I know.
Did you even see his face?
I don't have to see his face.
I'm on my bike like 8... 9 hours a day,
I see these guys all the time in
their cabs, like, what do you mean?
Oh...
The only one worse than
the Pakis be the, hmm, Filipinos,
- Oh, my God.
- Crazy behind the wheel... Asian!
With that Asian vibe.
Well, the Philippines are considered
to be part of Asia, so...
Anyway, like I said,
I don't wanna talk about my shit.
So, you don't have any shit...
You said your were perfect.
Wait a minute. I never said I was per...
I never said any of those type of words.
Fucking never.
What I said was that,
what you see is what you get.
That's what I said, <i>Eduardo</i>.
The name is Eddie, OK?
It's short for Edwin.
There's no fucking <i>Eduardo</i> here.
- You could have fooled me.
- Oh, really?
So, that's how it's gonna be?
We're gonna do that
black-Latino shit right here?
I ain't doing no shit.
You doing something right now.
Hey, hey, hey, fellas, come on.
- What? Tell him!
- Tell him!
Hey, hey, I'm telling both of you.
Oh, yes-o, boss.
Wow! You're really gonna go there, Joe?
Not everybody has it, you know,
their own private plane,
so, I should just hush, right?
You know why I have my own jet, Michael?
Let me think...
White...
Rich guy...
You know, for your information,
this guy doesn't come from money...
His Dad worked in a factory.
His Mom died when he was 12.
He went to a public school,
and when he barely graduated,
he went to work alongside his father,
and all of his brothers,
and that was it. That was decided.
That's as far as this guy was gonna go.
But you know what he did?
He refused to accept that story.
Because he imagined something
bigger for himself.
So, 18 years old
with 60 dollars in his pocket,
he hopped on a bus to New York City.
- And that's where...
- I met you.
Yes.
That's where you met me.
So, Michael, you can be mad
at everything that you don't have,
or envious of people who have
way more than they need,
but you have no idea what people
go through to get to where they are.
Or how much money they give to charity.
Or how they fund kids,
so they can go to college.
That's who this guy is.
All right?
That's who he is.
Then, why are you divorcing him?
- Hello?
- Hello?
<i>¿Sí? ¿Quién es?</i>
Is that... is this Eddie's wife, Gloria?
- Yes, who is this?
- Yes.
You don't know me.
I'm calling you for your husband.
You probably know what's going on.
He's... at present, he's in an elevator,
and the elevator's stopped,
and they're stuck.
With a group of people,
amongst them my daughter,
but everybody's safe, and...
He wanted you to know that...
That he loves you very much.
Will you grab that water?
What are you doing?
You guys all have seen those
hotel safety videos, right?
I'm just gonna make some handkerchiefs,
we could filter the smoke.
The most expensive hanky I've ever had.
Italian?
No, it's David August.
- Made in America.
- Just like me.
- Eddie.
- Yeah?
What do you say we...
try and pry those doors open again?
We could try...
But we open it,
there's gonna be more smoke coming in.
D'you got any better suggestions?
- All right.
- OK.
- Come on, Michael.
- Let's pry something in there.
- Michael. - Yeah, yeah, yeah...
- Come on.
Should we get it open, stick your
bag in, your helmet, something.
- I got it. - Go, go!
- Ready? OK, Edwin.
One, two, three!
OK, Got it?
OK.
Oh, shit!
Fuck, it's like fucking 50
degrees warmth out here!
- Did you see anything?
- Can we get out?
Clear floors or landing?
Anything?
- Give me - give a screw-driver!
- A screw-driver.
- You got it?
- Oh, shit!
- This?
- Where's the screw-driver?
Right here!
Right here!
Water? Water or something?
- What we got there?
- What's going on?
This is shit rock.
It's soft!
That's good.
The shafts don't have cement.
It's dry wall.
Maybe I could - I could keep...
I could keep digging at it and maybe...
Maybe we could get all the way through.
You understand?
Son of a bitch!
- What's going on?
- Oh, fuck.
My breath,
I'm losing my breath, man.
No, no, no!
I can't breathe, I can't breathe!
My heart's racing.
You're fine, brother,
you're fine.
Are you a doctor now?
I don't think so. I can't...
What's going on?
What'd you feel like?
Are you constricted?
Is your arm OK?
OK, wait... wait, wait.
I think I'm having a heart attack.
- I feel... my heart.
- Does that run in your family?
I can't breathe. I'm Puerto Rican,
I'm Puerto Rican, OK?
- Fucking heart diseases work fine
with us. - Eddie, look at me.
- Eddie, look at me. Take this, OK?
- What's that?
- That's for heart attack?
- No.
I'm not having a heart attack.
I'm not having a heart attack.
I'm confused.
I'm confused.
Be quiet.
You have to be quiet.
- OK, OK, please.
- Don't breathe too hard.
Have you ever
had a heart attack?
Help me down.
Please, help me down.
- Please, let me sit down.
- OK, OK, all right?
It's gonna be OK.
Trust me, I know the difference between
a cardiac attack and a heart attack.
OK? You're all right?
You're OK?
- I wanna get out of here.
- I know, I know.
Oh, I'm so the wrong person for this.
<i>What steps are you taking next?</i>
<i>David, I'm sorry to interrupt you
but we're looking at live pictures</i>
<i>of the Pentagon where
there is willowy smoke.</i>
Come on!
<i>Just reported that
they heard an explosion</i>
<i>and right now, we're looking at an
aerial view of the Pentagon.</i>
<i>Mick, can you talk back to us?</i>
<i>Officially, nobody knows
exactly what happened,</i>
<i>I think the picture is pretty clear...</i>
Hey, can you hear me, guys?
Hello?
Metzie, this is Jeffrey!
Hey, Jeffrey, I don't wanna make you
nervous or anything, but I...
I'm not sure what I'm looking at,
I got these blueprints,
and it says that,
the solenoid is in, like,
the locking thing.
It is like a cylinder,
and it's probably about
4 inches long
and it's kind of... you know,
it's a locking thing.
D'you see it?
How many stable
positions does it have?
I don't know how many
stable positions it has!
- OK. Right.
- Over here.
All right, hold on, hold on.
Hold on.
OK, Metzie.
Tell me this diagram, please.
The blocking system is called,
the solenoid,
There's a blocking solenoid
that looks like a cylinder.
And below it, just below it,
there's like a little plunger thing.
And then, the solenoid
itself is four inches long,
with one inch diameter and it's at the
top of the door on the left side.
OK, I got it. Now, can you tell
me how it's mounted, please?
It's... at the top of the door,
on the left side.
- That's what it says in the book.
- OK.
OK. All right, I got that.
<i>The sources are confirming the
reports that one of the planes</i>
<i>was a highjacked flight,
an American flight,</i>
<i>from Boston to Los Angeles,</i>
<i>They are all so now into what's
going on at the Pentagon,</i>
<i>They don't have any details
but they have now put</i>
<i>Government buildings
around the City of Washington,</i>
<i>on a heightened state of alert...</i>
OK, I know what we're looking for.
It doesn't matter,
we can't see it.
Yeah... listen.
Anybody got a mirror?
You got a mirror?
I have a mirror... in my bag.
- All right, come here. Flashlight?
- I got that.
- Where's the mirror?
- I'll bring it. - All right.
OK.
All right.
- Where do you want me?
- Point it, point it out here.
Out here, come on, come on.
All right, all right.
Could you point it up a little bit?
OK. A little bit to the right.
OK, just a tick to the left.
Right there?
Right there, right, right...
OK, there!
- Can you see it?
- Yes.
Can you reach it?
I 'm gonna need a good
reach from up here.
At least...
All right...
OK, I know what we gotta do.
We gotta figure out
how we're gonna get up there,
Look, right? Just, just...
Just hop on my knee.
Hop on my knee.
OK, guys, all right,
help me up there, raise me...
Ready? One, two, three... go!
OK, OK. Can you hand me the pliers?
Pliers.
- Yeah, hold on, hold on, hold it.
- OK.
- Give me a sec, Eddie.
- Yeah?
We make out of here and you
wanna still keep gambling,
you look me up.
I will put you in a
whole different casino,
and you will bring home
more winners than losers.
- OK, Jeffrey, not so fast, OK?
- OK.
OK, all right, guys.
- Eve?- Yeah?
- A little more this way, please.
- OK. There?
- A little more...
- Yeah?
- Right there. Hold it.
I can feel...
Shit, I can feel...
OK, I got something here.
OK, guys, I need about another inch.
Feel... shit, I can feel...
All right... there.
OK.
- Hold this side.
- OK.
- Ohhh!
- Shit!
- Give me...
- What do you need?
- Screwdriver!
- I got it!
- Give him something. - I got it-
- Hurry up!
- OK, OK.
- Is it OK?
- All right.
- You still need a mirror.
- No. - Where's the mirror?
- No, no.
I got it. I got it.
I'm gonna hold on to it.
- OK, good.
- I know what I have to do.
Hold on, guys.
OK, almost, almost...
- OK, I need another inch, please.
- OK. - All right, lift him up!
Way to go!
We can open the door!
Yes! Yes!
Metzie! Metzie!
We did it!
We got it!
- What did you do?
- We opened the door.
- We opened the door.
- Yes, OK!
- Hey, listen, what can you see?
- OK, we're in-between floors.
All right, we can get
to the floor above us.
But, we can't get to the landing
below us, so we're gonna have...
We're gonna have to dig
our way out of here.
Dig your way...?
Hold on a minute!
The shaft wall...
that's soft, it ain't cement.
I know, you're in the mechanical shaft.
We're gonna go through the wall!
There you go.
There you go.
Can I get that - that mallet, please?
- Cover your faces.
- Oh, shit!
OK, here we go, guys.
Here we go, here we go.
Fuck!
<i>Since they said, quote,
that this was clearly terrorist-related,</i>

It's OK, grandma...
Dad doesn't work in those
buildings anymore.
Why are you upset?
Oh, some terrible people did some
terrible things today, sweetheart.
Yeah, but, we hope they're OK, right?
Mum and Dad had a serious meeting today.
What was the meeting?
Well, you spoke to them?
- Remember?
- Yeah.
Dad said he and Mum are coming home.
Did he say that?
Well, then, that's exactly
what's gonna happen.
They're probably on their way home now.
Everything is gonna be all right.
Things are gonna be fine.
Grandma...
Nana needs a hug.
Nana needs a hug right right away.
Stand back, stand back,
stand back.
Michael...
Did you ever hear the one about the
billionaire who hires a bike messenger?
No.
You just did.
Right in!
Right in!
Yeah! Looks good!
Come on!
- What's that?
- Here you go!
We got a wall.
Gotta get through there, man.
- What's in there?
- Here, let me get that.
There you go!
There you go!
Come on, you can do it.
Yeah!
- What's that?
- Can you see anything?
Come here!
Take a look at this!
- Take a look!
- What? - Mhmm.
What do you see?
What's there?
What's in there?
- What is it?
- It's a janitor's closet.
- What? - This is...
- Go, go, go, go!
You got it!
Go!
Wait, wait, wait, I got it.
I got it!
OK!
OK!
Which one of you ladies
wanna go first?
Me... first.
- Come here!
- Fine, fine, I'll go.

So you don't get stuck.
Come on, hurry up!
Hurry! Go!
Ready?
One, two, three.
Up you go, up you go.

Got it?
Come on, get in there!
Come on, Eve!
Get her in!
Get her in!
Yeah.

- OK.
Shit.
Are you OK?
You gotta hurry, you guys oughta
run for it... - Eve, Eve, Eve...
It's fine up here, you have to hurry.
Eve, please, listen to me!
This crate is going down.
Yeah, I know, that's why you have
to hurry. You have to come now.
I love you.
And I swear I will never
ignore you again.
That's my promise.
- Now, go!
- Jeffrey!
- Run as fast as you fucking can!
- I will see you in the lobby.
I will see you in the lobby.
Promise me!
I hope.
I will see you in the lobby, Jeffrey!
<i>¡Dios mío!</i>

It's the sudden stop at the end.
Please, get out of my way.
Let's get... Go down!
Everybody down!
Some people are stuck in the elevator,
they can't get down to the lobby.
There are people downstairs
who can help them.
We're going up. All the way up.
Let's go!

I gotta tel you that.
So, please, forgive me.
But I think I gotta go.

All right, start pounding on all
the doors until you see them.
