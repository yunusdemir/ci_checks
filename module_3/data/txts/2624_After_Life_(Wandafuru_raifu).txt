This old man Yamada...

All he talks about is sex.
MONDAY
MONDAY
Sounds awful.
Sounds awful.
Awful. He seems so happy,
I try to listen cheerfully.
But three days!
Three days of that stuff.
Give me a break!
But he chose
a vacation with his wife?
Yeah. Apparently,
that's what he wanted.
Reconsidered at the last minute.
Not a bad story.
He sure took his time choosing.
It's a lot of hard work.
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

Kawashima, here you go.

Should've boiled some water.

- Good morning everyone!
- Good morning!
Last week we managed
to send all eighteen through,
all because of your diligence.
This week, we have a heavier load.
Twenty-two in all.
Eight for you, Kawashima.
Sugie, seven.
Mochizuki, seven.
That's it from me.
Well, we have another week before us.
My name is Takahashi.
Please have a seat in the lobby.
My name is Kori.
Kori Yone, is that right?
Please have a seat in the lobby.
My name is Tatara Kimiko.
...my monthly military pay
was 95 yen...
...about the time of
the Two Two Six Incident...
...in July of 1937,
when the Roko Bridge Incident...
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
We're ready to begin now.
Card #1 Tatara Kimiko.
Please go to conference room A.
Card #2 Kori Yone.
Please go to conference room B.
Card #3...
<i>Mochizuki
Shiori</i>
Yes. Please come in.
Good morning.
You can hang your coat there.
You're Tatara Kimiko, right?
First of all, your birthdate.
April 3rd, 192O.
Which means you're...
78 years old.
I think you already
understand the situation,
but I need to inform you officially.
Tatara Kimiko,
you died yesterday.
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- I'm very sorry.
You'll be staying with us for one week.
Everyone gets a private room.
Just relax and enjoy yourself.
But while you're here,
there is one thing
you must do.
From the entire 85 years of your life,
we need you to select one memory.
One memory that was most meaningful
or precious to you.
There is a time limit.
You have three days to decide.
When you've
chosen your memory,
our staff will do their best
to recreate it on film.
On Saturday, we'll screen
the films for you.
As soon as you've
relived your memory,
you will move on,
taking only that memory with you.
Yamamoto san,
thinking back over
the fifty years of your life...
I really don't want to think
about all the things I've done.
I have only bad memories.
And even if I had
lived a lot longer,
I doubt things
would have improved much.
- Only one?
- Only one.
Can I move my chair?
Sure, sure, of course.
Relax.
Go ahead,
whatever's easiest for you to talk.
The most moving experience
of my 29 years...
Whatever else they tell you,
for a man, it's when you're doing it.
That's the best!
Ask anyone, you'll see.
When you've been treated so badly
you swear you'll never be
with another man again,
I swore I wouldn't.
But then someone's kind to you,
you know how women are.
But aren't men the same...
What do you think?
Well...
You mean, I mean...
something that was fun
or made me happy?
I see, well.
Of course I had many.
My own life didn't work out
exactly as I wanted it to,
but I was energetic and
lived a full life in my own way.
So everyone ends up here?
- Everyone?
- That's right.
You mean whether you were
good or bad or whatever,
all that stuff about
going to hell if you're bad...
Not true?
Everyone's here?
That's right.
Listen Iseya,
in your 21 years,
Oh, I heard your explanation and all,
but the thing is,
I have no intention of choosing.
None.
This week's assignment list.
Thanks.
- What are you reading this week?
- A mystery called "R".
Amazing that you can read
a whole book every week.
How is it?
- You can have it when I'm done.
- As soon as I finish mine.
- Which is?
- The World Encyclopedia.
Time I've got plenty of.
I've got a tough one!
A 21 year-old named Iseya.
No real job,
but somehow oddly confident.
Really not my type.
How about you, Mochizuki san?
- I've got two.
- Two?
Watanabe san, a 70 year old man
and Yamamoto san, 5O.
Two, that's tough!
- What are they like?
- Just average.
In the end, they're the worst,
aren't they?
- Earl Grey.
- Earl Grey?
- Like it?
- Not bad.
I'll make you a cup.
Another hard day!
Lower your voice, Nakamura san!
I said, lower your voice.
'Night.
Wait a minute!
Say, how about a game of chess?
Ask your friend the security guard.
What?
Not another fight?
TUESDAY
There's nothing dramatic about my life.
It was very ordinary.
But if I had to choose,
I'd say my childhood
was the best time of my life.
At about what age?
Let's see, I'm not sure,
but about the second year of
junior high school.
It was the day before summer vacation.
I grew up in
a working-class neighborhood,
and rode the tram to school.
I always sat in the very front,
by the driver's seat where the breeze
came in through the open window.
It was a short ride,
but the feel of that breeze
flowing past my whole body.
That breeze...
<i>The bridge where,
by chance, after the war,</i>
<i>she was reunited with her fiancee.</i>
We'd promised to marry each other,
but he told me not to count on it.
It was towards the end of the war.
So when you were
crossing the bridge,
had you given up all hope of
ever seeing him again?
No, I knew he'd come back.
I was waiting for him.
Were there lots of other people
- coming and going on the bridge?
- Yes.
But I didn't see any of that.
It was just the two of you?
Yes, I guess that's how it was.
We were so young.
She had this little bell on her bag.
And whenever she walked
the bell would ring, "ding, ding."
When I was in the clubhouse
and I heard that
"ding, ding"...
I knew she was coming.
I loved the sound of that bell.
I wonder when it was...
Winter maybe...
I was in the hall,
tying my shoelaces,
putting on my shoes to go home.
It was night, and so dark...
and I wasn't wearing street shoes,
but Converse sneakers
and tying the laces.
There was no salt... Since the battle
the night of March 2nd,
we'd had no salt at all
and we were so weak.
Even our sweat...
Didn't taste at all salty.
When we found
coconuts or bananas,
we couldn't climb the trees.
So we cut down the trees
with our swords,
wrapped the coconuts
in a Japanese flag,
slung them over our shoulders
and ran every whichway.
Then, I was surrounded
by forty or fifty of them.
They had guns and everything,
I figured, if I'm going
to get shot anyway,
I want to smoke a cigarette
and eat some rice first...
So I said,
<i>"Give me cigarette..."</i>
And they... I guess they figured
I couldn't get up anyway.
One of them pulled
a cigarette out of his pocket
and I thought, I might
get somewhere with these people.
<i>"I am hungry."</i>
<i>"Boiled rice give me."</i>
I kept talking like this...
and held onto the shoulder
of one of the American soldiers
to a shack about
two or three hundred meters away.
It was like a guard shack.
Inside, they boiled some rice,
laid out banana leaves on the table,
spooned rice from the pot
onto the leaves and salted the rice.
I was deliriously happy...
I ate it by the fistful...
I thought I might really
get somewhere with these people.
Then I saw a chicken and thought
some chicken would be nice.
We were all hungry
and decided to get some pancakes.
The pancakes at
Disneyland are so good,
so we went to eat some.
But I didn't have enough money,
so I was the only one
who couldn't eat them.
My friend gave me one of her's and
it was so good.
Afterwards we were all full
so then we decided to go,
it was kind of far,
to ride the...
Splash Mountain.
We all decided to ride it together
and we all got on...
Here you are. I looked for you.
Careful, it's hot.
Thanks.
Here goes!
Yummy!
When you said,
was it - Splash Mountain -
you had so much fun at?
I've been working here
for about a year, now.
It's been about that long,
and well, you're the 3Oth person.
- I am?
- Yes, exactly.
I see...
Thirty people...
all chose Disneyland...
Yeah, lots of kids choose it.
Especially teenage girls.
I see.
Let's see, I guess...
at the time of the Great Earthquake,
I was nine years old.
I was only a child,
but I'll never forget it.
Our house was on the Koshu Road,
and people were clinging to the ground
on both sides of the road.
Everyone was clinging to the ground
so I thought I should too,
and I joined them.
Eventually the earthquake stopped.
And then we were all told
to go into the bamboo grove.
I was just a child,
so I played among the bamboo trees.
What did you play with?
We hung a rope between
two bamboo trees
and swung on it.
The mothers were
cooking rice in the open
and made us rice balls.
Eating those rice balls
in the bamboo grove...
I still remember that.
It's amazing how you do forget...
You swear you'll never do this again,
once labor starts.
I guess it's different for everyone,
but one friend told me,
she was thinking about the next child,
as soon as her baby was born.
So I have to say...
if you couldn't forget,
if that pain stayed with you forever,
there would be very few
brothers and sisters in the world.
<i>The cliff where he tried
to commit sulcide</i>
<i>at age 20.</i>
Just as I was about to jump,
the moonlight glinted off
the railroad tracks.
The light was pale blue and ghostly,
I somehow recall...
A pale blue light like lightening
shone right into my eyes.
Before I knew it,
the train was gone...
Standing there, dazed,
the image that came to me
was my girlfriend's face,
and my mother's face.
Having to choose a single memory...
I've never really looked back
at my life that way...
If I had photo albums
or diaries at hand,
memories would probably
come back to me...
Any children, Watanabe san?
I had none.
Any hobbies...
Nothing special.
Any trips with your wife...
Do I have choose
that sort of thing?
I started at 16,
and it'd be quite a feat to count
all the women since.
- All in the Quarter?
- Yes.
If you waste too much time
making up your mind there,
they close up shop at eleven...
After that, none of them
are presentable.
Early in the evening,
the beauties would call out:
"Hey, handsome,
you look like a regular.
Come on over!"
And I'd fall for it...
They'd be so expensive!
But later in the evening,
just before closing at eleven,
they'd start discounting.
1,0OO Yen down to 5OO.
That's the deal you're waiting for,
but you can't be lucky every day.
After all, what's a woman
without a pretty face...
Maybe five, six months
after I was born,
5 or 6 months?
Yes. I was born in May
and it was sometime in the fall.
In October or November?
I can't be certain exactly,
but about that time.
I hadn't been alive very long.
- I think it was in autumn...
- Autumn...
And it wasn't morning,
it was the afternoon.
I can't be certain,
but I think it was afternoon.
I was naked, lying on the futon,
when I was bathed
in this amazing sunlight,
an autumn light, not too hot.
What time of day?
Dusk, yes, about three o'clock.
Wasn't there something...
Nishimura san, any happy memories...
Were you married?
Ever married...
Any children?
How about grandchildren?
Don't you have any flowers here?
Oh yes, in the springtime they bloom.
They're very pretty.
They must be very pretty.
Nishimura san,
how old are you now?
It seems Nishimura san
already chose her memories
while she was still alive.
I didn't realize it myself, at first,
but she's living
in her memories from being 9.
Nine years old...
I wonder how we look,
how the world looks,
to someone like her.
You have to wonder,
what she thinks
when she looks in the mirror.
Next!
- Oh no, this one!
- Why?
Even today, he's still insisting,
not that he can't choose
but that he won't.
No desire to choose?
- How old is he?
- 21.
After 21 years there must be something.
Why don't you take him?
Forget it.
I'm no good with his type.
All right,
I guess I'll keep at him.
You've got to hang in there.
Watanabe Ichiro, 70 years old.
After college,
he worked for a steel company
until he retired.
His wife was his only family
and she passed away five years ago.
He wants to choose
some evidence of his own life.
Evidence of life?
That sounds good,
but most people don't leave
anything like that behind.
A little late to look for it here.
Just in case,
I'll order the videotapes.
This is Bundo san.
So this is Bundo san?
Once in a while you run into this,
but less than a year old, right?
Who remembers that far?
How far back
do most people remember?
Typically, four years old.
Four, huh...
What's your earliest memory?
Me?
I had just started kindergarten.
I rode the bus there.
My transparent bus pass
twinkled in the light.
I could go anywhere.
I was filled with hope and so happy.
Riding at the front of the bus,
pass case swinging.
My first memory's
also from kindergarten.
They used to give us all
hot tea.
- Tea?
- The taste of that hoji tea.
I remember eating my box lunch
and drinking the tea.
My tongue remembers.
It's the memory
of a certain taste.
And you, Mochizuki san?
I was also about three or four.
I have this intense memory of snow.
My grandmother's house was
in the country, up north in Yamagata.
Thinking back on it now,
playing in the snow there
is my first memory.
I loved the snow.
- The snow...
- Was it cold?
It was like...
being surrounded by silence.
- You remember the sound?
- The sound.
Most of us
remember from age 3 or 4?
What happened to all the memories
before then?
Lots of things happened.
Apparently some people can remember
as far back as being in the womb.
Medical research proves it.
Inside the womb, huh?
If you close your eyes
and immerse yourself in water,
the memory of the sense of security
of being inside your mother
can help with anxiety
and other conditions.
No, I'm serious.
<i>Bath Occupied</i>
Yes, his name is Watanabe Ichiro.
Just to be sure,
can you copy all 71 videotapes?
This week,
I need his and Yamamoto san's tapes.
When will you be able to deliver them?
Tomorrow afternoon?
Yes, that's fine.
Thank you.
WEDNESDAY
<i>WEDNESDAY
Good morning everyone.</i>
<i>Good morning everyone.</i>
<i>It's now Wednesday morning.</i>
<i>Today is the deadline
for choosing your memories.</i>
<i>You absolutely must,</i>
<i>make your choice by sundown.</i>
Changed your mind?
I see, but why?
I just sort of...
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.
I see...
Well, let's spend today
thinking it over.
Can I pick a dream?
- A dream?
- Yeah.
What kind of dream?
The kind you dream at night...
For instance, there's all kinds...
Some people have scary dreams...
You mean dreams from
when you're sleeping?
Yeah, exactly.
Like I mean...
like in my case, like,
there's this amazingly colorful beach
and a ship's docked there.
Someone's running super fast,
chasing me.
And I'm running as fast as I can,
but you know in dreams everything's
pretty spacey.
- Slow motion?
- No, not slow motion.
But wouldn't it be amazing
if you could recreate that sensation?
- Out of the question?
- Was that dream so important?
Not enough to choose it.
When I caught a cold,
she made me rice porridge with miso
and pickled plums mixed in.
She blew on it herself
to cool it down, saying:
"Eat it while it's still hot."
You remember that kind of woman.
You can't make porridge by stirring up
rice that's already been cooked.
You'll only end up with rice soup.
You have to make
porridge from scratch,
washing the rice and...
It's a lot of work.
Where did she make the porridge?
It was up in the north,
maybe Aomori...
- Was this at her house?
- Yes.
- An apartment?
- Yes.
How large?
About 4 or 6 tatami mats.
Whenever that happened,
I'd forget about contacting Tokyo,
I'd just want to stay with that woman
for about five days.
When I recovered,
there was no stopping me...
I had to repay her, right?
Just pretend with your right hand.
Don't strike with your right.
That's right, now you've got it.
And next...
Oh, all right, let's try it.
OK, OK! Excellent!
You've got it now!
These videotapes contain
a record of your life.
One for each year, seventy-one in all.
They won't match
your memories exactly,
so please just use them for reference.
Watch them as a way of
bringing back the past.
I see, well, I'll try to do my best.
- I'm sorry to be so intrusive.
- Oh, no.
I'll stop in again this evening.
Videos, huh...
In Aoyama,
I don't know if it's still there.
There used to be the Youth Hall.
And also the Japan Youth Hall,
and the Music Hall in Hibiya,
I danced in them all.
I remember the Music Hall
in Hibiya best.
I remember having the most fun there.
Do you remember
the songs you danced to?
"I Want a Big Elephant,"
"Sparrow Dance,"
and also...
"The Kintaro Dance"
and "Red Shoes."
Do you remember the dance steps?
Not very clearly,
but "Red Shoes" went,
<i>A little girl in red shoes,
that's how it went. Then,</i>
<i>A foreigner took her away,</i>
you link arms with your partner.
<i>Then wave your handkerchief,
and away she went</i>
That's all there was to it,
but thinking back,
it certainly was fun.
At the time, Motoori Nagayo,
who wrote the song, was still alive
and he had three daughters.
His two younger daughters
both wore these red dresses.
My brother thought they were so cute.
He looked all over Tokyo
to find one for me. I wore it...
Whenever I came home from dancing,
he always wanted
to show me off to everyone.
He promised to treat me to "red rice,"
which thinking about it now,
was chicken rice.
In those days, there were "cafes."
There were two or three waitresses...
It was rather dark,
but not too dark to see faces, of course.
That's where he would take me.
And he would say,
"Show me how you danced."
And I wanted to eat that
chicken rice so badly,
I danced for him there.
And then his friends
would call to me, "Come have some
ice cream," so I'd go over to them.
I was absolutely thrilled.
I was still in my dancing clothes
and I danced for them.
I wanted to eat those dishes...
Funny, isn't it?
Were you close to the brother
who bought you the dress?
Very close.
Until the very end.
He already...
Yes, three years ago.
I nursed him to the end.
I was seeing someone then,
and that day,
when I got back to Tokyo...
we went to
lmperial Hotel together.
It was like, how should I...
It was our own private
Adult Day Ceremony.
Do you remember
what the weather was like that day?
Yes, it was snowing.
So when you looked out the windows
it was snowing?
He wasn't the kind of man
who only paid attention
to his own needs.
He was always attentive
to a woman's feelings.
So, when we were making love,
I really began to feel,
even though I did it for a living,
that I was the heroine in a movie.
He was so kind.
That's how I think of him.
I thought:
How nice it would be to be with him.
But I found out later,
he had a wife...
I struggled with that.
I really did.
Do you remember
what you talked about with him?
Talked about?
He never said, "I love you."
At one time,
I wanted to be a pilot
and I was in training.
It only happened once.
I was between the clouds.
What I saw flying
in the clouds,
made a deep impression on me.
What kind of plane were you in?
What's usually called
a Oessna.
A small four-seater.
Looking out from the Cessna,
do you remember
the shapes of the clouds?
They were almost pure white.
The shapes were like,
tufts of cotton candy
they sell at fairs,
just floating in the sky.
But they were really,
not too large, or too small,
A size that wasn't frightening.
I remember the clouds
seemed very gentle.
<i>"We've got to change</i>
<i>"the way Japan is today.</i>
<i>"It's up to us,
to bulld a new tomorrow.</i>
<i>"Even If it's only one thing,</i>
<i>"I want to leave behind
some evidence of my life.</i>
<i>"There you go again, with that
evidence stuff. What evldence!?</i>
<i>"Join a flrm, work there all your life,</i>
<i>"and all that's left is to die.</i>
<i>"I don't want that, I just don't!"</i>
Are any of these
like the plane you flew in?
No, this body is a Piper.
The Cessna is a high-winged plane.
The wings are above.
Above?
These wings are below, low-winged.
When we refer to a Oessna,
we're talking about
wings that are high.
It's as though the body
is suspended from the wings.
That's how you should think of it.
The placement
of the wings,
makes all the difference in an airplane...
For me to remember
from one of these...
The shape doesn't matter, the wings do.
That's just how I feel.
<i>"Oo you have a hobby?</i>
<i>"Movies...</i>
Idiot!
<i>"0h, I love the movies too!</i>
<i>"Ingrid Bergman, Joan Fontaine....</i>
<i>"Old you see "September Affair"?</i>
<i>"How about "Rebecca"?</i>
<i>"What kinds of films do you like?</i>
<i>"What kind?</i>
<i>"American films, French films...</i>
<i>"I like samurai action and...</i>
<i>"Bantsuma!
My father's a fan.</i>
<i>"I've seen many with him."</i>
Say I choose a memory,
from when I was
eight or ten years old.
Then I'll only remember
how I felt back then?
That's correct.
I'II be able to forget
everything else?
Really?
You can forget?
Well, then that really is heaven.
He chose a memory
from when he was five,
of his secret hide-away
filled with junk.
He wanted to choose the darkness.
The darkness... huh.
You could recreate that
with sound alone.
Could be interesting.
He must be burdened with a past that
he can't talk about to anyone.
Listen, man.
You can't start identifying with them.
It's just a job, you know, a job.
You won't last
if you let it get to you.
Another day.
I wonder how Watanabe san's doing?
I think...
he'll be doing this.
Are we disturbing you?
No, please, come in.
Excuse us.
Newlyweds?
Yes, um, something like that.
I never had the chance
to be married... I'm envious.
This is my wife...
Her name is Kyoko.
We had an arranged marriage
the year before.
...happy?
Yes... well.
I see...
Well, it was very, very ordinary.
You want to be taken off
Watanabe san?
Very unusual. That's not like you.
You've never asked for that before.
THURSDAY
Until I came here,
I had a certain confidence
about my own life.
That in my own way, I was happy.
But looking back like this,
I feel like something's missing...
A so-so education,
a so-so job,
a so-so marriage,
and a so-so retirement.
Everything's so-so, just so-so.
But you said yesterday
it was a good marriage.
Yes, I believe it was a good marriage.
Maybe too good for me.
It may sound odd...
but it's not as though we were
united by burning passions.
You're not alone in that.
In fact, wasn't that fairly typical,
at least for our generation?
Did you just say "our" generation?
Yes.
The truth is,
I was born in 1923,
and died at the age of 22.
Even though
I don't look any older,
had I lived,
I would be 75 years old.
I see...
- In the war?
- Yes.
I was wounded in the Philippines,
and died in a hospital in Tokyo.
When?
May 28, 1945.
Oh, that brings back memories!
This, this is it!
Let's see...
the lily pond by the main entrance
was beautiful.
Are you sure?
It's just that,
something's a little off.
You said you stayed here
on Adult Day, right?
That's right.
You're 47 years old right?
In fact, demolition work
on this hotel
began on December 1st, 1967.
The years don't add up.
You're at least... four years off.
Well, I, you know,
when I met my current husband,
I was about two years past thirty.
Oh, so you told him twenty-eight.
Well, you know,
I wanted to look good,
I wanted to be young for him, so I...
Actually,
I've also shaved
five years off my age.
And not just my age.
I use the name Sugie here,
but it's not my real name.
My company went under and
I had so many bad debts,
I just had to stay on the run.
Murakami, Kashiwagi,
Yamamoto, Naito...
I even used a Ohinese name, Wong.
Really?
Not really.
Now we're even.
The truth is...
The truth is he never showed up.
I kept waiting, but...
My dream about the future,
about that dream...
The reason I can't choose it...
The future is out.
- But...
- Stick with something
that already happened.
But those are just memories.
And ultimately, we end up
turning memories
into our own images.
Of course, it really happened,
so it feels very real, but...
Say I construct the future,
as though I'm making a film about it.
As I imagine all kinds of situations,
I think what I create,
would feel a lot more real
than some memory.
That's what I think.
And that's a lot more meaningful than
looking back at the past.
So this... looking back at the past,
living with a single moment
from my past,
would be too painful for me.
No good?
I think you'd better reconsider.
Yeah, it's your whole set-up here
that needs rethinking.
What am I going to do with this one...
I think it looked like this...
with the smocking.
I think this is what the dress was like.
You liked Western dresses?
Dresses?
I don't remember wearing one
before kindergarten.
But for kindergarten,
he bought me a pink dress.
I loved that dress.
It was pink?
It was embroidered here,
with smocking across the chest.
My friend Yoshie had the same dress.
I remember jumping for joy
over that dress.
Did you ever dance in that dress?
Let's see.
Maybe I did...
but I don't remember clearly...
It was really a little girl's dress,
that pink...
The sleeves were all puffed up.
Short sleeves.
In the springtime,
it must be beautiful here.
It's beautiful in the spring.
Do the cherry trees blossom?
Yes they do.
Do you like cherry blossoms?
Me too. I love cherry blossoms.
Look, this is
my daughter.
Her name is Sakurako
because she was born in April.
She's three in this picture,
our last one together.
Don't her ears look just like mine?
I've been here three years now,
so she's already six.
Her grandmother's raising her.
I can't help but worry.
I only get to see her on
the Day of the Dead.
At least until her Adult Day Ceremony
when she's 2O.
Fourteen more years.
I've got to fulfill
my responsibilities as a father.
That's why I'm here.
She was only three when I died...
I think I was about three.
It was in the summer and the white
wash was drying in the breeze.
My head was resting on my mother's
lap as she cleaned my ears.
I remember
how my mother smelled then,
and the way my cheeks felt
against her lap.
She was so soft and warm,
It felt so familiar.
Say!
What is it?
Thank you very much.
It's better than Disneyland, right?
You can remember how you mother's
lap felt and how she smelled...
Only vaguely.
Don't you remember?
I remember, for instance,
my father's back
when he was carrying me.
It was so broad and firm.
And the smell of his sweat,
and how his hair tonic stank.
Well, excuse me.
- Where are you going?
- Location scouting.
Give me a break, Shiori!
You went to scout the bamboo grove,
but these are useless!
They were pretty.
Sure they're pretty,
but we can't use them
to recreate anything.
Can't you be more serious?
We shoot tomorrow!
What were the bamboos like?
Just average...
Average! Be more specific!
So, the bamboo grows
from the ground up...
Bamboo is not going to grow
top to bottom! It's not a root!
I told you it was average.
Absolutely useless!
Do you always
have to be so defensive?
How did your parents raise you?
Exactly like your daughter, Sakurako.
I'm what happens when
you don't know your dad.
Keep her out of this!
You jerk!
She sure is demoralizing.
Don't let her get to you.
Not all 18 year-olds are like that.
As it is,
I'm not cut out for this work,
but I do it anyway.
Oh man,
You can't help but wonder sometimes.
What's the point of all our work?
Recreating memories of the dead.
What are we doing it for?
He says the clouds looked like
tufts of the cotton candy
they sell at fairs.
Light and airy.
He remembers the wings
slicing through the clouds,
and the sky he saw
through the cockpit window.
I'd like to emphasize those.
Right now we only have
this type of plane.
Looking out the side,
all you see is wing, right?
We'll remove the wing.
It's removable.
Let's remove the wing,
bring it on set and film it that way.
So, from his point of view,
the wing will be above him.
Yes, use a fake wing.
We need to recreate a kind of intense
summer heat inside the tram,
and also blow in
a cool, not a cold breeze,
through the window.
How about using a fan?
To get the feeling of
a breeze on him,
let's use the old one
stopped at the park.
That will feel like a breeze.
It's difficult to convey
temperature with visual images.
Instead let's try
spraying his forehead,
to create a little sweat.
Red is the only color.
If the background was monotone,
that might heighten
the effect of the red.
It's the red shoes and the dress
that are important in red.
The chicken rice is also important.
It symbolizes her feelings
for her brother.
What are you doing?
I was just admiring
the beautiful moon.
The beautiful moon!
How terribly romantic!
Just your usual self, I see.
- Say?
- What?
Who's Kyoko?
Who?
No use pretending.
I'm not hiding...
Someone from your past?
A lover?
It wasn't like that.
Whatever. You don't have to talk
about it if you don't want to.
It doesn't concern me anyway.
Good night.
Shiori!
You should apologize
to Kawashima san tomorrow.
Oh, it's you.
Got a minute?
Fine, but keep it short.
I'm going to bed.
OK, I understand.
How beautiful the moon is tonight.
The moon is fascinating, isn't it?
Lts shape never changes,
yet it looks different,
depending on the angle of the light.
You came to my room
to talk about the moon?
I wonder if she got my point...
FRIDAY
<i>The electrical circuits</i>
<i>are overloaded.</i>
<i>Please refrain from using
hair dryers.</i>
Good morning.
We're ready.
You sit there...
This bed here and...
Yes.
It was shaped like a tray, yes.
When did you choose, Gramps?
Haven't.
Oh, so you're Watanabe san.
I'm Iseya...
It looks like we were the only ones
who couldn't choose.
Why couldn't you?
Look who's asking!
Why can't you choose?
For me,
It's not that I can't.
It's that I won't.
I won't choose.
You see,
I decided this is the way
to take responsibility for my life.
Today's the shoot day so everyone's
trying to look their best.
Combing what little hair
they have left,
putting on extra make-up.
Ended up blowing the fuses.
Actually, it's kind of sweet.
Everyone working so hard
to look good.
I guess that's just how people are...
But it shouldn't be that way.
It should be like...
As you get older,
your looks start to fade...
They're trying to compensate
for the confidence they don't have.
They're working so hard to fake it.
Which is why the younger generation,
like me, makes fun of them.
<i>Really?</i>
<i>I said that?</i>
<i>Yes you did, wiping off
sweat with your handkerchief,</i>
<i>you said you like the movies.</i>
<i>I did not!</i>
<i>Yes you dld!</i>
You did so.
<i>...I really did?</i>
<i>OK.</i>
<i>Once a month, the two of us
wlll go to the movies together.</i>
<i>Yes, yes.</i>
<i>What kind of response is that!</i>
<i>Well, you...</i>
<i>How rude! Here I'm trying to...</i>
<i>0K dear. That's what we'll do.</i>
<i>We certainly have plenty of time.</i>
It's just an idle afternoon in the park.
I'm happy for you.
At Chuo Park next to
the movie theatre in Ginza.
It had been a while...
Actually,
in the forty years we were married,
we never went to the movies together.
As it turned out,
that was the last time
we went to the movies together...
I see.
I didn't make the three-day deadline,
and I caused you a lot of trouble.
No, no, please don't mention it.
Don't tell the others, but
everyone who works here
couldn't choose either.
So, it's embarrassing when you
apologize to me like this.
You, too?
Yes, me too.
I see.
That's why I'm certainly
in no position to judge you.
Oh, I see.
You've been here ever since you died?
No, I came here three years ago.
Before that, I did the same work
in different facilities.
So that's how it was.
Please tell me,
was it that you couldn't,
or that you intentionally didn't?
The reason I ask the question
is that it occurred to me
that not choosing,
might be one way
of taking responsibility...
Responsibility?
OK. Rehearsal!
Ready, Action!
- How about the wing?
- We'll hang it from above.
Olouds please.
- Raising it will...
- Lower it...
How are the clouds?
This is exactly like being in-cloud.
In-cloud?
When you're surrounded by clouds.
Even though your
field of vision is clear,
there's a patch of clouds
that you plunge right through.
So basically,
you're flying through a clear sky,
and there's a clump of clouds ahead...
You plunge into them and it's like
the clouds are racing past you.
So they're not coming at you,
they're flowing by.
That's right.
So it's summer, in the summertime.
The window's open...
On this side is Shinobazu Pond
and the trees...
This side could be
a little brighter, right?
During the day, the light's
not on inside, so it's dark.
The exposure here will...
- And for sound?
- I've prepared a cassette.
Oh, that brings back memories.
Perfect, just perfect!
Says its perfect!
So the driver's sitting right here.
Yes. I'd be watching.
He didn't mind if I stood here.
- I couldn't stand there.
- So in fact,
you're staring at the view
outside this window.
This side too, of course.
Actually, this side's better.
A little bit more on this side.
Like this?
Let's try the breeze...
With the hat on.
Should he take the hat off?
It doesn't really...
Maybe it's better with it on.
In reality, the hat would fly away...
I guess it might...
So maybe it's better off.
What's best?
Hold it in his hand?
It was hanging from about here.
This feels just like...
when we were playing together then.
Too big?
- They used to be big, right?
- Even bigger.
Let's make them even bigger.
You can make one, Shiori.
Just watch how grandma does it.
Nowadays, young people go hiking,
but not when we were young.
Eating with my parents
in a bamboo grove
was a real treat!
Weren't there lots of mosquitoes?
It was September so they were gone.
But when we spent the night there
we slept under mosquito netting.
Mosquito netting?
Yes, we slept under the netting...
That night, the night of the
Great Quake on September 1st,
was the night of the Korean "riots."
People went crazy.
They said the well water was
poisoned, and there was a huge uproar.
I was more scared of that...
As it turned out, the Koreans
had gathered to run away,
but people thought
they were going to attack.
I see, so false rumors had spread.
Some rumors are false...
They were just false rumors.
What are you going to do for the clouds?
Are you going to use cotton?
I'm not sure exactly
how it's going to work.
Ready for numbers 5 and 6.
Is this spot...
Can you stand by the camera
and have a look?
We're ready!
Ready! Action!
It's just like I'm really flying...
The same feeling...
There's this sense of distance...
It's very real and amazing...
It looks really great from here!
Good. He says its OK.
I'll be your brother.
Oh, I see. Thank you.
I'm a little old
to be your younger sister.
She's playing you.
So, will you teach her
the steps to "The Red Shoes?"
I don't remember them very well...
Shall we?
OK, here we go.
<i>A Ilttle girl</i>
<i>in red shoes</i>
<i>A foreigner took her away</i>
And you put your hand like this.
And twirl around once,
and then wave your handkerchief.
And you're done.
You wave the handkerchief like this.
Shall we try it?
She's so darling!
<i>A Ilttle girl</i>
How was I...
How was I holding the handkerchief?
I'm not holding it at the start.
<i>A little girl in red shoes</i>
<i>A foreigner took her away
and away she went</i>
What did I do with
the handkerchief? Oh dear.
Oh well, just hold this, OK, dear?
<i>And do A little girl...</i>
She looks just like the doll from
"American-born celluloid."
<i>A little girl in red shoes</i>
<i>A foreigner took her away</i>
<i>and away she went</i>
My brother will be thrilled.
When I prayed at his altar
this morning,
I told him we'd be
filming here today.
There really was a time
when I looked like that...
Do we need a few more leaves?
The area you're
dropping them on now...
And a little more colorful please.
Over there.
Yes, that area.
SATURDAY
Thank you, everyone.
Your week is over.
This is the last time
we'll all be together.
You'll move to
the screening room now,
and watch the memories
that we recreated for you.
The moment you relive your memory,
you'll move on to a place
where you can be sure
of spending eternity
with that memory.
<i>By the time you read this letter,</i>
<i>you will have
disappeared from my memory.</i>
<i>There's not much time,</i>
<i>so I will express my feelings briefly.</i>
<i>You were my wife, Kyoko's, fiancee.</i>
<i>When I heard your name
and the date of your death,</i>
<i>several images fell into place.</i>
<i>That my wife had once been engaged,</i>
<i>to someone who dled in the war...</i>
<i>She told me all this
when we first met.</i>
<i>Even after we were married,</i>
<i>she visited your grave,
once a year, alone.</i>
<i>That you did not
discuss Kyoko with me,</i>
<i>was a gesture of kindness,</i>
<i>for which I am grateful.</i>
<i>I would be lylng if I were to say</i>
<i>that I was not jealous of how
Kyoko cherished your memory.</i>
<i>But the years we
spent together as a couple</i>
<i>overcame that.</i>
<i>I've only understood that
by coming here,</i>
<i>that's allowed me to choose
a memory with her.</i>
<i>I have affirmed
the 70 years of my Ilfe.</i>
<i>I really wanted you to know.</i>
I didn't tell him the truth,
not because I was being kind.
Nor was it that
I didn't want to hurt him.
I was afraid it would be
too painful for me to tell him.
The way Kyoko
revealed herself to him...
The way he accepted her
just as she was...
I never let myself
get that close to anyone.
How can you just say that!
Maybe you were deeply involved
with Kyoko in a way
you couldn't even see.
Found it.
"Watanabe Kyoko"
Nakamura san handled her case.
It's the same park
Watanabe san chose.
But it's dated
August 3rd, 1943.
This is it.
She chose this moment.
You're going away, right?
You're going to choose.
I can tell.
You're going to choose
a memory with her, right?
Why did I have to help you!
I'm so stupid!
At the time,
I searched desperately
inside myself,
for any memory of happiness.
Now, fifty years later,
I've learned
I was part of
someone else's happiness.
What a wonderful discovery.
You too...
someday, will find this.
I won't choose.
If I choose,
I'II have to forget
all about this place.
So,
I won't choose.
I'm going to keep you
inside me,
forever.
I can't bear to be forgotten
by any more people.
Shiori...
I only came to this understanding
through the time I spent here,
through all the people I met and
said goodbye to here.
So I promise
I'll never forget what happened here.
SUNDAY
Yesterday's set?
I was so happy yesterday.
Sitting alone on the bench,
was the first time
I could look back happily
on the 22 years of my own life.
I see. I understand.
We'll make a special
exception in your case. Congratulations.
Thank you everyone,
for your help.
Rolling...
Out!
That mystery novel.
I only got part way through it.
Will you read it for me,
after the Encyclopedia?
I wonder how she'll do...
I wonder...
I hope she's up to it.
Excuse me, bathroom break.
No, not that old trick.
It wasn't on purpose.
I swear!
MONDAY
MONDAY
Old man Shoda, after all that talk
MONDAY
MONDAY
about all those women,
MONDAY
MONDAY
chose his daughter's wedding.
Chose his daughter's wedding.
Where she's handing
her parents the bouquet.
- How sweet.
- What's sweet!
After all that time
I spent with him.
All that women talk was just
a cover for his embarrassment.
When old guys like that get assigned
a young woman,
they go on and on about sex.
The trick is to never
act embarrassed.
I'll be fine, just fine.
Good morning.
Shiori, it's cleaning time.
Good morning.
Last week,
we managed to send off 22,
including Mochizuki san.
All because of your diligence.
Unfortunately,
Iseya, who was assigned
to Kawashima...
Will be joining you
for certain reasons.
He'll be working as Kawashima's
assistant for some time.
Please all help him out.
OK, let's have a word from Iseya.
Iseya!
Iseya?
- Where'd he go?
- He's going to be a tough one.
Kawashima.
Excuse me, I'll go look for him.
Iseya!
Shiori, shall we clean?
Good morning.
Good morning.
Ooki san, Ooki Masayoshi.
You're #1.
I'm Araya Sadako.
Araya Sadako san.
- You spell it A R A...
- Yes, OK. You may go.
<i>Satonaka Shiori</i>
Please sit down.
Miyahara san,
Mlyahara san, from the
35 years of your life,
I'd like you to select
your most important memory.
But today is Monday,
so you only have until
the day after tomorrow...
Today is Monday,
and Wednesday is the deadline.
The staff here will do their best
to recreate the memory you select.
