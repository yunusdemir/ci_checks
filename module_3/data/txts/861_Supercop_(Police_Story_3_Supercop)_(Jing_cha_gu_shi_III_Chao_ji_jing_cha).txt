The pushers have improved...
on means of drug smuggling
Drugs are hidden in condoms
Stomachs, rectums or even corpses
lncluding babies' bodies
Last year alone. . .
there were 1 50 cases of deaths
Caused by drug poisoning due. . .
to puncture in condoms
However,
they were in the minority
Most traffickers succeeded in passing the Customs
To fight drug activities has been one
Of the most important tasks. . .
of HK Police
This info is already known to us
Will you please get to the point?
OK, most of the drugs circulating
Come from drug king Chaibat
Capturing him. . .
will at least halve the circulation
ln what aspect can the Royal HK police help you?
Yes, what we need is a super cop
well, let me think about it.
l'll let you know tomorrow
Fix it for me, tell me tomorrow
Yes, sir
Superiors don't do things.
They give orders
Right
Fix it for me
l know already
Bring back Chia-chu right away
Yes, sir
Thank you
Yes, sir
Morning, inspector Chen
Morning
Chia-chu, they're having a meeting
We mustn't let Chia-chu take up the mission
why not? lsn't he responsible?
Yes, he is
Doesn't he obey his superiors?
Yes, except for the nastiest superior
You always claimed l didn't promote him
Now he's got a chance and you won't let him do it
Chance?
lt's no fun infiltrating the Camp?
Are you afraid he can't make it?
No one can if he doesn't
lt's a waste putting him. . .
on patrol
Now lnterpol needs a super cop
He's a super cop,
but you won't let him do it
l know, but it's a most dangerous mission
He's followed me for so many yeas.
l can't let him take the risk!
Ok. we'll go...
and say 'no' to lnterpol
None at the Royal HK Police. . .
can do it
Send for James Bond
Good!
lnspector Chen
Uncle Piao
Chia-chu, come in
l want to see you
Sit down
What is it so urgent?
A position suits you most
The lnspector of Shataukok Police Hq. Sign it here
Uncle Piao, let me do it
l'm letting you do it
The air is fresh at Shataukok Police Hq
And you don't have to patrol
l mean the lnterpol mission
Have you heard of it?
Let me do it
lt's the most dangerous mission
When one is numbed. . .
by everyday routine
Sitting in office could be more dangerous
Do you have to consult May?
Not necessary. l've made the decision
Go and be prepared
Yes, sir
Chia-chu
Yes?
The Commissioner must be happy to know it
Are you unhappy?
l'd be happier if the Commissioner did it
Aren't we very mean?
A little bit, but you're the more so
why?
Because you're my superior
why have you to enter the camp so abruptly?
What training is that? why didn't you call me?
A Special Training Camp.
l get a promotion after that
Aren't you happy for me?
Yes, since it's not a dangerous mission
lt's safer in the camp involving no risk
My life insurance policy
My bank passbook
why are you giving them to me?
You're the beneficiary. Come
what are you doing?
The key to the safe with foreign currency deposits
Why are you giving me all these?
Didn't you say you'd return very soon?
l'm afraid l may be late
Don't forget to pay the insurance premium for me
And renew the bank deposit when it matures
what are you doing?
One month!
You're late
They won't kill me for being late
Remember not to woo boys!
You'd better guard yourself against it!
May
- Uncle Piao - Uncle Piao
l'll keep an eye on him for this month
Go now, bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye, Uncle Piao
Your certificate and air ticket for Canton
Yes, sir
Be on the alert
Don't worry,
the Chinese Public Security will help fully
That makes me worry the more
Uncle Piao, say something better, will you
Good luck!
ln fact, the Royal HK police
are flying Chia-chu like a kite for this mission
lt may break when the wind is gusty,
no one know where will it be
Don't make such daring parable
Don't worry.
l'll drift back if the string breaks
Chia-chu is up to the scratch, as l said
Good luck!
Thank you, sir
Uncle Piao, l'm leaving
Good luck!
- Yes, sir
- Chia-chu
Stop nagging
Call this number in case of emergency
Remember this number. Tear it in a minute
l've remembered it
- l'm leaving
- l'll tear it for you
l'm leaving
Thank you
l'm making a call. Don't disturb me
You're giving him my hone number!
OK, for everybody!
Please

Big brother, a call for you
Whether we can win this lawsuit is immaterial
But you must get back

Not just try, you must
l know what to do if you do it well
General
welcome, Chaibat
Poor crop in the Golden Triangle;
too much rain
l'm afraid l have no stuff for you
where are they?
The 30% l got can't meet the demand
l don't care what you guys want. l want 3 tons
You heard it. The two of them got 50%
Give all the rest to me
Sorry, l've already taken the other half
The others have no share
Are you the one to dictate?
You think you're President Bush?
All l want to say now...
is no stuff this year
So you met...
to take away my cut
Business is business! Does my dough stink?
who dares to say that?
But who didn't pay...
for the last batch?
l didn't
l have lots of money in a Swiss bank
But somebody tipped off...
the Malaysian police
They arrested my wife
So l owed you the money
Your wife got arrested by Malaysian police?
She might squeal
Don't use violence!
Chaibat, talk, don't use violence!
He's the informer!
You can say anything. What have you got?
What have l got?
General, good stuff!
What happened?
This is big brother's signal
Let me see
Stop, don't move!
Don't shoot
lt's all dynamite inside the clothes!
One shot,
and you'll all perish with me
Big brother
ls my sister okay?
Don't worry, she's safe with big brother
Fix those two. . .
if you hear the bang
Okay?
Yes
Okay
Drop the gun!
Don't ever try to rob me. . .
of my share
Double-cross me?
Chaibat, don't ever misunderstand
l'm in business
Talk over your personal grudge
Before speaking to me
Let's go out
General, general
lt's me. What now?
None of you must get out of this house!
Surround the house quickly!
l've endured enough,
you won't get out here alive
Shoot if you have the nerve
Fu-Sheng, finish him off!
Give it to me
Where's my sister?
Chaibat
Fire if you've the guts!
Hold me!
Let go!
watch this side for me!
what are you doing then?
You took off the bullet-proof vest, why?
lt's full of dynamite!
Dynamite? That creep!
l mustn't get hit
l mustn't get hit too
Run quickly!
Go in
l shouldn't have brought you here
You really are clumsy!
You are clumsy yourself!
See if anything can be used
lt has no bullets
Catch!
Move, and l shoot!
what did he say?
No idea. l guess they daren't shoot
l count to 3...
and we feign to throw grenades
- 1 , 2, 3
- what did you say?
Feign to throw grenades!
Next time speak more clearly
Chaibat, come out!
What's it so serious, general?
You take the law into your own hands in my area
You're not giving me face
You aren't giving me any either
You didn't help me over this
Blaming me! What am l to say to the others?
You don't have to
As of now, l'll buy all the stuff here
l'll make good to you this loss
A compensation alone can't settle everything
l can't help if you don't agree
But l know you're smart
l wouldn't have come unprepared
Look around if your eyes are still good
well, l won't push you too hard
But l can't decide on you cornering. . .
the stuff here
Do you have to see Mr. Chin Sha?
lf you lead, l don't mind going with you
Prepare the helicopter
Yes
ls it OK?
Chaibat
You gave my sister a dynamite-laced vest?
what if she really got hit?
Stay where you are!
None dare you to talk to me in this tone!
Hua
You scum!
Hua
You'd have died
if it weren't for a bullet-proof vest
l won't treat my brothers this way
You two kids really are okay
Chaibat, you're great. Please
Take them to Malaysia and wait for me
Have a good time
Scum, l'll get him sooner of later!
Miss Cheng, Mr. Chaibat sends you his regards
Did you come here to say this only?
Whatever the verdict, we can still appeal
l know the law here well
He has good reason to set your mind at ease
No point in saying only
He wants me to get...
the code to your Swiss bank account
l'll tell him when l see him
Get a clearer idea of what's around here
Let me take a photo for you, here
Come on, smile
Go over there for a look
Fu-Sheng, this is most important
Please come over this way
Welcome, ladies & gentlemen, to Merdeka Square
Get acquainted with surroundings
of this street
Come, let's go over there
The serious criminals take this route to the Court
Take a closer look
Panther, would you tell us why?
we'll tell you then
Come, let's take a look at the junction
Hi, want to go for a swim?
will Chaibat raid the court
and rescue the prisoner?
lt's possible
when could it be?
He said he'd tell us then
Come for a swim quick. Let's get together
Come for a photo, all of you
Stand over, one more
Stand still
we can see the photos
we're now in the dark
and have lost contact with HK
What on earth are we doing here?
Look

Let's go over to have a look
What's happening?

Nothing

Coming over
Massage me

A headache
Your brother must be highly strung

Okay
