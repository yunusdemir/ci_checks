GIRL: Mistletoe!
Fresh here today. Good afternoon.
Hot chestnuts. Chestnuts.
# Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
You there, boy. What day is this?
Christmas Eve, sir. What year?
You thick or something?
Oi. Just answer the question.
Year of our Lord 1851, sir.
Right. Nice year. Bit dull.
GIRL: Doctor!
Doctor?
Who, me?
Doctor!
Don't worry, don't worry. Stand
back, what have we got here? ..Ooh.
OK, I've got it. Whatever's behind
that door, I think you should
get out of here. Doctor!
No, I'm standing right here. Hello.
Don't be so stupid, who are you?
I'm The Doctor.
Doctor who? Just The Doctor.
Well, there can't be two of ya.
Where the hell have you been?
Don't worry. Stand back.
What have we got here, then?
Hold on, hold on. Who are you?
I'm The Doctor. Simply The Doctor.
The one, the only and the best.
Rosita, give me the sonic
screwdriver. What? Now quickly,
get back to the TARDIS. Back
to the what? Stand back, sir.
This is a job for a Time Lord.
Job for a what lord?
Oh, that's different.
Oh, that's new.
TOGETHER: Allons-y.
I've been hunting this beast for a
good fortnight. Now step back, sir.
Some sort of primitive
conversion,
like they took
the brain of a cat or a dog.
Well, talking's all very well.
Rosita.
- I'm ready.
Now, watch and learn.
Excellent. Now then, let's pull
this timorous beastie down to earth.
Or not. I might be in
a little bit of trouble.
Nothing changes. I've got you.
You idiots!
Perhaps if you could pull?
I am pulling. In this position,
I couldn't not pull, could I?
Then I'd suggest you let go, sir.
I'm not letting you out of my sight,
Doctor. Don't you recognise me?
No, should I? Have we met?
This is hardly the right time for me
to go through my social calendar.
A-A-A-A-A-ARGH!
Whoa!
It's gonna jump!
We're gonna fa-a-a-all!
Well, I'm glad you
think it's so funny.
You're mad. Both of you.
You could've got killed.
But, evidently, we did not.
Oh, I should introduce Rosita.
My faithful companion, always
telling me off. Well,
they do, don't they?
Rosita?
Good name. Hello, Rosita.
Huh. Now I'll have to go
and dismantle the traps.
All that for nothing.
And we've only got 20 minutes
till the funeral, don't forget.
Then back to the TARDIS, right?
Funeral? Oh, long story.
Not my own, not yet.
Oooh, I'm not as young as I was.
Well, not as young as you were
when you were me. When I was who?
You really don't recognise me?
Not at all.
But you're The Doctor.
The next Doctor.
a future Doctor anyway.
No, no, don't tell me
how it happened. Although...
I hope I don't just trip over
a brick, that'd be embarrassing.
Then again, painless.
Worse ways to go, depends on
the brick. You're gabbling, sir.
Now, might I ask,
who are you, exactly?
No, I'm, uh...
I'm just Smith. John Smith. But
I've heard all about you, Doctor.
Bit of a legend, if I say so myself.
Modesty forbids me to agree with
you, sir. But yes. Yes, I am.
A legend with
certain memories missing.
Am I right? How do you know that?
You've forgotten me.
Great swathes of my life
have been stolen away.
When I turn my mind to the past,
there's nothing. Going how far back?
Since the Cybermen.
Masters of that hellish
wall-scuttler and old enemies of
mine, now at work in London town.
You won't believe this, Mr Smith,
but they are creatures
from another world.
Really? Wow.
It's said they fell onto London,
out of the sky in a blaze of light.
And they found me.
Something was taken.
And something was lost.
What was I like? In the past?
I don't think I should say. Sorry.
Got to be careful with memory loss.
One wrong word...
It's strange, though.
I talk of Cybermen from the stars
and you don't blink, Mr Smith. Ah,
don't blink, remember that?
Whatever you do, don't blink?
The blinking and the statues?
Sally and the angels? No?
You're a very odd man.
Hmm, I still am.
Something's wrong here.
Oh, the funeral.
The funeral's at two o'clock.
It's been a pleasure, Mr Smith.
Don't breathe a word of it.
Can't I come with you?
It's far dangerous.
Rest assured, I shall
keep this city safe.
Oh, and, er...
merry Christmas, Mr Smith.
Merry Christmas, Doctor.
Report.
Cybershade 16 has made contact.
Then observe the enemy.
This man is dangerous.
This man is our enemy.
This man is The Doctor.
I've been hunting this beast for a
good fortnight. Now step back, sir.
The attack is scheduled
for 1400 hours.
Plans for the Ascension
demand a successful intervention.
Is everything in position?
That's rather dependent on you.
All I can promise is to do my best.
Define the parameters of "best".
As you would say, I will operate
at maximum efficiency.
And you'll keep
your part of the bargain?
You will be heralded, in the new age
at the Court of the CyberKing.
ALL: The CyberKing will rise.
The CyberKing will rise, indeed.
How like a man.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a funeral to attend.
BELL TOLLS
The late Reverend Fairchild,
leaving his place of residence
for the last time.
God rest his soul.
Now, with the house empty, I shall
effect an entrance at the rear
while you go back to the TARDIS.
This is hardly work for a woman.
Oh, don't mind me saving your life.
That's work for a woman,
isn't it?
The Doctor's companion does what
The Doctor says. Off you go.
Hello. How did you get in?
Oh, front door. I'm good at doors.
Do you mind my asking,
is that your sonic screwdriver?
Yeah. I'd be lost without it.
That's a screwdriver.
How's it sonic?
Well, er, it makes a noise.
That's sonic, isn't it? Now, since
we're acting like common burglars,
I suggest we get out of plain view.
This investigation of yours, what's
it about? It started with a murder.
Oh, good.
I mean bad, but whose?
Mr Jackson Lake, a teacher of
mathematics from Sussex.
He came to London three weeks ago
and died a terrible death. Cybermen?
It's hard to say, his body was
never found. But then it started.
More secret murders,
then abductions.
Children, stolen away in silence.
So whose house is this?
The latest murder.
The Reverend Aubrey Fairchild.
Found with burns to his forehead,
like some advanced form
of electrocution.
But who was he, was he important?
You ask a lot of questions.
I'm your companion.
The Reverend
was the pillar of the community,
a member of many parish boards.
A keen advocate of
children's charity. Children again.
Why would the Cybermen
want him dead?
And what's his connection to the
first death, this Jackson Lake?
It's funny,
I seem to be telling you everything.
As though you
engendered some sort of...
trust.
You seem familiar, Mr Smith.
I know your face.
But how? I wonder.
I can't help noticing
you're wearing a fob watch.
Is that important?
Legend has it that the memories
of a Time Lord can be contained
It's said
that if it's opened...
Oh. Maybe not.
Yeah. Anyway, alien infiltration.
Look for anything different,
possibly metal.
Anything that doesn't seem to
belong, perhaps a mechanical device
that could fit no earthly engine.
It could even seem to be organic,
but unlike any organism
of the natural world. Shh!
What's that noise?
Oh, it's just me...
whistling.
I wonder what's in here, though.
Ah.
Different and metal, you were right.
They are infostamps.
I mean, at a guess.
If I were you, I'd say they worked
something like this.
See? Compressed information.
Tons of it.
That is the history of London,
1066 to the present day.
This is like a disk, a Cyberdisk.
But why would the Cybermen
need something so simple?
They've gotta be wireless.
Unless...
they're in the wrong century,
they haven't got much power.
They need plain old basic
infostamps to update themselves.
Are you all right? I'm fine.
No, what is it?
What's wrong?
I've seen one of these before.
I was holding...
this device,
the night I lost my mind.
The night I regenerated.
The Cybermen, they made me change.
My mind, my face, my whole self.
And you were there.
Who are you?
A friend.
I swear.
Then I beg you, John.
Help me. Ah.
Two words I never refuse.
But it's not a conversation
for a dead man's house.
It'll make more sense if we go
back to the TARDIS... Your TARDIS.
Hold on, I just need to do
a final check. Won't take a tick.
There's one more thing I cannot
figure. If this room's
got infostamps, then maybe,
just maybe, it's got something
that needs infostamping.
OK.
I think we should run.
Run, Doctor! Now, Doctor! Delete!
The Doctor will be deleted.
Delete!
Stairs! Can't lead them outside!
Delete!
I'm a dab hand with a cutlass.
You don't want to come near me
when I've got one of these.
This is your last warning. No?
OK, this is
really your last warning!
OK, I give up. Delete! Listen.
Whatever you're doing stuck in 1851,
I can help!
I'm the only person in the world who
can help you! Listen to me! Delete!
I'm The Doctor.
You need me. Check your memory
banks, my name's The Doctor.
Leave this man alone,
The Doctor is me! Delete!
The Doctor, remember?
I'm The Doctor!
You need me alive!
You need The Doctor, and that's me!
Delete!
Infostamp with
a cyclo-Steinham core.
You ripped open the core
and broke the safety, zap!
Only The Doctor would think of that.
I did that...
last time.
Come here, you'll be OK.
Let me just check. You told them
you were The Doctor.
Why did you do that?
Oh, I was just protecting you.
You're trying to take away the
only thing I've got, like they did.
They stole something, something
so precious. But I can't remember.
What happened to me?
What did they do? We'll find out.
You and me, together.
Forasmuch as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy,
to take unto Himself the soul
of our dear brother here departed,
we therefore
commit his body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
and dust to dust,
in sure and certain hope of the
Resurrection to eternal life,
through our Lord Jesus Christ,
who shall change our vile body,
that it may be like
unto his glorious body,
according to the mighty working...
Do continue. Madam, I must protest.
Whatever for? A lady at the
graveside is debatable enough, but...
your apparel....
Is it too exciting?
You're disgracing the ceremony,
dressed like a harlot.
Oh, and you should know, Mr Cole.
How do you know my name?
You've walked past me so many times,
all you good men of charity,
never once asking my name.
It's Miss Hartigan, isn't it?
Oh, you noticed.
I saw you looking, you cheeky boy.
I'm sorry, but who is she?
Matron of the St Joseph Workhouse,
your humble servant.
Oh, I've watched you all.
Visiting, smiling.
Bestowing your beneficence
upon the poor while I scrubbed
down their filthy beds.
I must insist that you depart.
But that's why the late
Reverend Fairchild had to die.
To gather you all in one place.
Where better than a funeral?
Man that is born of woman
hath but a short time to live.
Although I've got some friends
who might disagree with that.
Would you like to meet them?
Hark! I can hear them now.
MARCHING
Mr Cole, Mr Scoones, Mr Fetch,
Mr Milligan, stay where you are.
You're needed. The rest of you are
disposable. Sorry.
But what manner of men are they?
Cybermen. Save yourselves!
I repeat, Mr Cole, Mr Scoones,
Mr Fetch, Mr Milligan. Stay.
You monstrous witch!
Merry Christmas to you, too.
But why are we spared?
What do you need us for?
Your children.
It's funny, now I think of it,
but in all these years not one
of you has asked my first name.
It's Mercy.
Doctor!
I thought you were dead!
Now then, Rosita.
A little decorum.
You've been gone for so long.
He's always doing this,
leaving me behind. Going frantic.
What about the TARDIS?
Oh, she's ready. Come on.
I'm looking forward to this.
You were right though, Rosita.
The Reverend Fairchild's death
was the work of the Cybermen.
So, you live here?
A temporary base,
until we rout the enemy.
The TARDIS is magnificent,
but it's hardly a home.
And where's the TARDIS now?
In the yard.
Er... What's all this luggage?
Evidence. The property of Jackson
Lake, the first man to be murdered.
Oh, but my new friend is a
fighter, Rosita, much like myself.
He faced the Cybermen
with a cutlass.
I'm not ashamed to say,
he was braver than I.
He was quite brilliant.
Are you whistling again?
Yes. Yes, I am, yeah. Yeah.
That's another man's property.
Well, a dead man's.
How did you two meet, then?
He saved my life.
Late one night,
by the Osterman's Wharf,
this...
creature came out of the shadows.
A man made of metal.
I thought I was gonna die.
And then,
there he was. The Doctor.
Can you help him, sir?
He has such terrible dreams.
Wakes at night
in such a state of terror.
Come now, Rosita.
With all the things a Time Lord
has seen, everything he's lost,
he may surely have bad dreams.
Yeah.
Oh, now, look.
Jackson Lake had an infostamp.
But how?
Is that significant?
Doctor, the answer to all this
is in your TARDIS.
Can I see it?
Mr Smith, it would be my honour.
There she is!
My transport through time and space.
The TARDIS.
You've got a balloon.
TARDIS. T-A-R-D-I-S.
It stands for Tethered Aerial
Release Developed In Style.
D'you see?
Well, I do now.
I like it. Good TARDIS.
Brilliant. Nice one.
And is it inflated by gas, yeah?
We're adjacent to the Mutton Street
Gasworks, I pay them a modest fee.
Good work, Jed.
Glad to be of service, sir.
You've got quite a bit of money.
Oh, you get nothing for nothing.
How's that ripped panel, Jed?
All repaired, should work a treat.
You never know, maybe tonight's
the night, Doctor. Imagine it,
seeing Christmas from above.
Well, not just yet, I think.
One day, I will ascend.
One day soon.
You've never actually been up?
He dreams of leaving,
but never does.
I can depart, in the TARDIS,
once London is safe.
And finally, when I'm up there...
Think of it, John.
The time and the space.
The perfect escape.
Do you ever wonder
what you're escaping from?
With every moment.
Then do you want me to tell you?
Cos I think I've worked it out now.
How you became The Doctor.
What do you think?
Do you want to know?
Mr Cole, Mr Scoones,
Mr Fetch and Mr Milligan,
you have your instructions and the
Court of the CyberKing is waiting.
First of all, let's just see.
A little test.
Turn right.
Turn left.
And face me.
Oh, I could do this forever.
But now,
set about your appointed tasks.
And bring them to me.
The story begins with the Cybermen.
A long time away, and not so far
from here, the Cybermen were fought
and they were beaten.
And they were sent into a howling
wilderness called The Void,
locked inside forevermore.
But then a greater battle rose up,
so great that everything
inside The Void perished.
But, as the walls of the world
weakened,
the last of the Cybermen must have
fallen through the dimensions,
back in time,
to land here.
And they found you.
I fought them, I know that.
But what happened? At the same
time, another man came to London.
Mr Jackson Lake.
Plenty of luggage,
money in his pocket.
Maybe coming to town for the
winter season, I don't know.
But he found the Cybermen too.
And just like you,
exactly like you,
he took hold of an infostamp.
But he's dead.
Jackson Lake is dead.
The Cybermen murdered him.
You said no body was ever found.
And you kept all his suitcases,
but you could never bring
yourself to open them.
I told you the answer
was in the fob watch.
Can I see?
JL.
The watch is Jackson Lake's.
Jackson Lake is...
you, sir?
But I'm The Doctor.
You became The Doctor
because the infostamp you picked up
was a book about one particular man.
The Cybermen's database.
Stolen from the Daleks
inside The Void, I'd say,
but it's everything
you could want to know
about The Doctor.
That's you.
Time Lord, TARDIS,
enemy of the Cybermen.
The one and the only.
You see?
The infostamp must have backfired,
streamed all that
information about me
right inside your head.
I am nothing but a lie.
No, no, no, no, no. Infostamps
are just facts and figures.
All that bravery,
saving Rosita,
defending London town.
Hmm? And the invention,
building a TARDIS. That's all you.
And what else?
Tell me what else?
There's still something missing,
isn't there?
I demand you tell me, sir.
Tell me what they took.
Really, I am so sorry.
But that's an awful lot
of luggage for one man.
Cos an infostamp is plain
technology. It's not enough
to make a man lose his mind.
What you suffered
is called a fugue.
A fugue state.
Where the mind just runs away,
because it can't bear to look back.
You wanted to become someone else,
because Jackson Lake
had lost so much.
CHURCH BELL STRIKES
Midnight.
Christmas Day.
I remember...
Oh, my God...
Caroline.
They killed my wife.
They killed her.
Oh...
You found a whole cache
of infostamps. But what is it?
What's that noise?
Activation. A call to arms.
The Cybermen are moving!
The Doctor needs help.
I learnt that much about him.
There should be someone at his side.
Now go.
Go.
What is it? What's happening?
That's Mr Cole. He's Master
of the Hazel Street Workhouse.
Maybe he's taking them to prayers.
Oh, nothing as holy as that.
Can you hear me?
Hello?
No?
Mr Cole, you seem to have
something in your ear.
Now, this might hurt a bit,
but if I can just...
They're on guard.
Can't risk a fight.
Not with the children.
But where are they going?
All need a good whipping,
if you ask me.
I've just seen another lot
coming from the Ingleby Workhouse.
Where's that? This way!
Dozens of 'em!
But what for?
You will continue.
You will enter
the Court of the CyberKing.
March.
That is an order.
March!
HE SOBS
Where is it?
Where is it?
That's the door to the sluice.
All the sewage runs through there,
straight into the Thames. Yeah,
that's too well guarded. We'll have
to find another way in.
Whoa! That's cheating, sneaking up!
Did you have your legs on silent?
So...
what do we have here?
Just walk towards me, slowly.
Don't let them touch you.
Oh, but they wouldn't hurt me,
my fine boys.
They are my knights
in shining armour.
Quite literally. Even if
they've converted you,
that's not a Cyber speech pattern.
You've still got free will.
Step away...
There's been no conversion, sir.
No-one's ever been able
to change my mind.
The Cybermen offered me the one
thing I wanted - liberation.
Who are you? You can be quiet.
I doubt he paid you to talk.
More importantly, who are you, sir?
With such intimate knowledge
of my companions.
I'm The Doctor.
Incorrect. You do not correspond
to our image of The Doctor.
Yeah, that's cos your database got
corrupted. Oh, look, look, look!
Check this! The Doctor's infostamp.
This infostamp would
damage Cyberunits.
Oh, well. Nice try. Core repaired.
Download.
You are The Doctor. Hello!
You will be deleted. Oh, but let me
die happy! Tell me - what d'you
need those children for?
What are children ever needed for?
They're a workforce. But for what?
Very soon now,
the whole Empire will see.
And they will bow down, in worship.
And it's all been timed
for Christmas Day.
Was that your idea, Miss...?
Hartigan. Yes.
The perfect day for a birth,
with a new message for the people.
Only this time, it won't
be the words of a man.
The birth of what?
A birth, and a death.
Namely, yours.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'm glad to have been part
of your very last conversation.
Now, delete them. Delete!
At your service, Doctor. Shade!
Sha-a-a-a-a-ade!
Run! Come on! Sha-a-a-a-ade!
One last thing. Oh!
Can I say, I completely disapprove!
Come on! Get off me.
I said, get off!
Tell your masters,
we're not waiting till dawn.
The CyberKing will rise...
..tonight!
That stronghold down by the river.
I need to find a way in.
I'm ahead of you! My wife and I
were moving to London so I could
take up a post at the university.
And while my memory is
still not intact,
this was in the luggage.
The deeds -
15 Latimer Street. And if I
discovered the Cybermen
there, in the cellar, then...
That might be a way in! Brilliant!
But there's still more.
I remember the cellar...
and my wife.
But I swear there was
something else in that room.
If we can find that, perhaps that's
the key to defeating these invaders.
So...onwards!
Maybe you should go back...
Don't even try! No.
You have wisdom.
If The Doctor is planning to
intervene, then the Ascension will
commence immediately. Excellent.
And as for you, Mr Cole, Mr Scoones,
Mr Fetch and Mr Milligan,
your work is done.
Children! Pay attention!
Now let the new
Industrial Revolution begin.
I want to see you work!
Energy levels 60% and rising.
Soon the CyberKing will awake.
Then show me.
Delete!
Must've been guarding this.
A Dimension Vault!
Stolen from the Daleks again,
that's how the Cybermen travelled
through time. Jackson, is this
the thing you couldn't remember?
I don't think so.
I'm... I just can't see.
It's like it's hidden.
Not enough power. Come on!
Avanti!
Oh, that is magnificent.
That is royalty, indeed.
And that's quite a throne.
Oh, you will look resplendent.
The chair you designate as "throne"
is not intended for me. My function
is to serve the CyberKing,
not to become the CyberKing.
Then who sits there?
No! Now, just...
I think if you remember correctly...
you said I was to be heralded.
All hail the CyberKing.
All hail the CyberKing.
But you promised
I would never be converted!
That was designated a "lie".
What do the Cybermen want?
They want us. That's what Cybermen
are - human beings with their
brains put into metal shells.
They want every living thing
to be like them.
You can't do this to me!
Incorrect. It is done.
But I would have served you anyway!
Your mind is riven with anger
and abuse and revenge.
These have no place in a Cybermind.
Activate!
Emotions have tormented you
all of your life.
Now you will be set free.
This is your liberation.
For the love of God!
Have you no pity?
Correct.
A CyberKing is born.
All hail the CyberKing.
'Pon my soul... What is it?
It's an engine.
They're generating electricity.
But what for? We can set them free!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Behold, such...
information!
Power at 90%! But if we stop the
engine, the power dies down, the
Cybermen will come running. Ooh.
Hold on. Power fluctuation.
That's not meant to happen.
It's going wrong? No, it's weird.
The software's rewriting itself.
It's changing.
DISTORTED VOICE: I can see
the stars, the worlds beyond,
the Vortex of Time itself
and the whole of infinity.
Oh, but this is glorious!
That is incorrect.
"Glorious" is an emotional response.
Exactly! There is so much joy
in this machine.
Joy is not acceptable.
Don't you see?
My mind is stronger
than you ever thought!
It dominates, sir!
It dominates you!
Alert! You are operating beyond
the standard parameters. I am new.
The might of your technology
combined with my own imagination.
Yes!
There will be a new race
of Cybermen. MY Cybermen!
Logic and strength combined
with fury and passion!
Diagnosis system failure!
You will be removed
from the processor.
What the hell's happening? It's out
of control! It's accelerating.
96%, 97...
When it reaches 100,
what about the children?
They're disposable. Come on!
I am CyberKing.
My mind inside the Cybermen.
And you will obey me!
All hail the CyberKing!
Power levels now at 100%.
Delete the workforce.
KLAXON SOUNDS
Delete.
Delete.
Delete.
Right. Now! All of you, out!
D'you hear me? That's an order!
Every single one of you, run!
All of you, come on!
As fast as you can, come on!
There's a hot pie for everyone,
if you leg it! Go!
Get them out of the sluice gate!
And once you're out, keep running!
Far as you can!
Come on, come on, come on.
Turn right at the corner!
Fast as you can, and don't stop!
Keep running, keep running!
Come, my soldiers.
Come to me.
Come on, come on!
Keep running! Keep running!
Go! Quick, quick.
It's some sort of starter motor,
but starting what?
Help!
Father!
Father! Father...
That's my son...
My son.
Doctor, my son! What?!
They took my son. No wonder my mind
escaped! Those damned Cybermen,
they took my child.
But he's alive, Doctor! Frederic!
Come on! No, he's too scared.
Stay there! Don't move! I'm coming.
CyberKing rising.
I can't get up there. Fred!
They've finished with the motor.
It's going to blow up.
What are we going to do, Doctor?!
Come on, Jackson.
You know me.
Oh, that's it. Hello!
Now, hold on tight. Don't let go.
Merry Christmas!
Go to St Stephen's. Ask for the
Warden, he'll take care of you.
Now run! Quickly!
CHILDREN SCREAM
It's under the water!
There's something in the Thames!
Head for the street.
Come on, Doctor! Hurry up! Gotcha!
Behold! I am risen!
Witness me, mankind,
as CyberKing of all!
It's a CyberKing. And a CyberKing
is what? It's a ship!
Dreadnought class!
Front line of an invasion.
And inside the chest,
a Cyberfactory,
ready to convert millions!
And I will walk!
I will stride across
this tiny little world!
My people.
Why do they not rejoice?
Take him south, go to the parkland.
But where are you going?!
To stop that thing.
I should be with you!
You've got your son.
You've got a reason to live.
And you haven't?
God save you, Doctor.
What the hell is that thing, sir?
Oh, good man. Jed, wasn't it?
Jed, I need your help!
I'm not going out there!
I'll give you five pound notes!
Um... All right. What d'you want
me to do? The TARDIS is gonna fly!
People of the world! Now hear me.
Your governments will surrender.
And if not,
then behold my power!
You're flamin' bonkers, sir!
It's been said before! Now gimme.
Not enough power, come on!
Jed! Let her loose!
Ever flown one of these before?
Nope! Never!
Can I have my money now?
Oh, get on with it!
Oh, sir. I thought I'd lost you.
My son, Rosita. This boy is my son.
Good luck to you, sir!
It's the TARDIS. She's flying!
Who the 'ell is that?!
His name, sir...
..is The Doctor!
Attention. Proximity alert!
How is that even possible?
Oh, this I would see. TURN!
Excellent. The Doctor!
Yet another man come to assert
himself against me in the night.
Miss Hartigan!
I'm offering you a choice.
You might have the most remarkable
mind this world has ever seen.
Strong enough to control
the Cybermen themselves!
I don't need you to sanction me.
No, but such a mind
deserves to live!
The Cybermen came to this world
using a Dimension Vault.
I can use that device to find you
a home, with no people to convert,
but a new world where you can live
out your mechanical life in peace.
I have the world below.
And it is abundant with so many
minds, ready to become extensions of
me. Why would I leave this place?
Because if you don't,
I'll have to stop you.
What do you make of me, sir?
An idiot?
No.
The question is,
what do you make of me?
Destroy him!
You make me into this.
Then I have made you a failure.
Your weapons are useless, sir.
I wasn't trying to kill you.
All I did was break
the Cyber-connection,
leaving your mind open.
Open, I think, for the first time
in far too many years.
So you can see.
Just look at yourself.
Look at what you've done.
I'm sorry, Miss Hartigan.
SHE SCREAMS
I'm so sorry.
He's killed it.
Whatever he did, he's killed it!
But it's gonna fall!
SCREAMING
Oh.
Now you're ready!
I'd say he used that Dimension Vault
to transfer the wreckage of the
CyberKing into the Time Vortex,
there to be
harmlessly disintegrated.
Oh, I've picked up a lot.
But here...
Ladies and gentlemen,
I know that man...
That Doctor on high.
And I know that he has done this
deed a thousand times! But not once.
No, sir, not once, not ever,
has he ever been thanked!
But no more! For I say to you,
on this Christmas morn,
"Bravo, sir! Bravo!"
Bravo! Bravo, sir!
Bravo, Doctor.
The city will recover,
as London always does.
Though the events of today
will be history, spoken of
for centuries to come! Yeah.
Funny that.
And a new history begins for me.
I find myself a widower,
but with my son
and with a good friend.
Now, take care of that one.
She's marvellous.
Frederic will need a nursemaid
and I can think of none better.
But you're welcome to join us.
We thought we might all dine
together, at the Traveller's Halt.
A Christmas feast, in celebration...
..and in memory
of those we have lost.
You won't stay?
Like I said, "You know me."
No...
I don't think anyone does.
Oh!
And this is it!
Oh, if I might, Doctor?
One last adventure?
Oh, be my guest.
Oh...
Oh, my word.
Oh, goodness me.
But this is...
But this is nonsense!
Well, that's one word for it!
Complete and utter,
wonderful nonsense!
How very, very silly!
Oh, no. I can't bear it!
Oh, it's causing my head to ache.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Oh! Oh, gracious.
That's quite enough.
I take it this is goodbye.
Onwards and upwards.
Tell me one thing.
All those facts and figures
I saw of The Doctor's life,
you were never alone.
All those bright
and shining companions!
But not any more?
No.
Might I ask, why not?
Because they should.
Or they find someone else.
And some of them...
some of them forget me.
I suppose, in the end...
..they break my heart.
That offer of Christmas dinner.
It's no longer a request.
It's a demand!
In memory of those we have lost.
Ohh, go on then! Really?!
Just this once. You've actually
gone and changed my mind.
Not many people can do that!
if anyone had to be The Doctor,
I'm glad it was you.
The feast awaits. Come with me!
Walk this way.
I certainly will!
Merry Christmas to you, Jackson.
Merry Christmas, indeed, Doctor!
