This summer's gonna
be great, right, Gus?
Yeah, it can't get any worse
than last summer.
That's for sure.
See, last summer was
a learning experience.
For instance, we learned where
my father keeps his cigars.
Now, Joe, you shouldn't be smokin'.
Man, it's bad for you.
Rolled on the thighs
of Cuban honeys.
- I swear, this summer's gonna be a ten.
- Ten plus.
Borderline 11!
See? I told you
not to be smokin'.
Holy smokes!
Hey, Gus.
Hey, Joe.
Oh, Gus!
- Hey, this is gonna be great, ain't it?
- Oh, it's gonna be a ten, Joe.
A ten? A ten plus.
Borderline 11!
- It's so quiet in here, Joe.
- Boy, it is. I wonder where everybody is.
Yeah.
Oh, it sounds like
they're in the kitchen.
A-all right. Hey, no... I don't care
what they say, all right?
It doesn't matter
what people say.
But they called
pops and uncle Gus jerks.
If they were jerks, they wouldn't
have won the fishing contest.
We weren't gonna let them
get away with this.
All right, you heard me.
No more fightin', all right?
- Your fathers are not jerks.
- Yeah, tell that...
Hey, what's-what's goin' on?
Um... Take a look at your sons.
Were you guys, uh,
playin' football again?
Hey, they're gonna be good
football players, Joe.
They sure are, Gus.
They're gonna be great like Gus.
Yeah.
So, uh, does anybody wanna
help us pack or what?
I wanna help you, but I wanna
just tell you one thing.
Uh-oh, here comes
Little Miss One Thing's speech.
Hey, Gus, this Billy "Catch" Pooler's
the best, ain't he?
<i>And even though they say that
only idiots use these lures...</i>
<i>it's the idiots who ain't
using' em. That's the idiots.</i>
We won his fishin' contest, Joe.
Man, I can't believe it!
<i>- And remember...
- He-he-he's the greatest, Joe.</i>
Dad, look. Are you gonna
wear your shorts?
Yeah, yeah,
they're my lucky shorts.
Eh-eh, baby, get my lucky shorts
too, okay?
<i>You gotta be the one
you wanna catch.</i>
- Yeah, you can have that.
- Hey, keep packing, guys.
I-it's the hands, the hands.
Believe in your hands.
<i>- You gotta flick.
- Flick.</i>
<i>- And dip.
- Dip.</i>
<i>- Flick.
- Flick.</i>
<i>- And dip.
- Dip.</i>
Okay, everybody, come on.
Let's help the contest winners pack.
Okay, everybody.
You're doing a good job.
Okay, everybody out now
cause me and aunt Cookie we wanna
say one thing to your fathers.
- Find mine, Tracey.
- All right? Listen.
We know how important
this trip is to you. We really do.
- But I just gotta say this one thing.
- One thing.
- Thanksgiving's on Thursday...
- Thursday...
You know?
And call me silly,
but I'm worried
that you're gonna end up
in the hospit'l or somethin' like last year.
- Or in jail like you did the year before.
- Yeah.
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- C'mon, everything's gonna be okay.
Yeah, this is gonna be good.
- But here's the thing.
- Yeah.
You've gone fishin' every year
since before we knew you,
and, so far, everything
has never been okay and fine
and, then, you never been
as far away as Florida.
But that's why this trip is so nice.
That's why it's so important.
I mean, we're goin' to the Everglades.
That's the biggie, right, Joe?
- Yeah, yeah, the Everglades.
- Everglades, yeah.
Hey, listen to this.
- Eh, we're gonna catch tarpon, snook, pompano...
- Yeah, tarpon.
- Catch this.
- I know you'll love that.
If you two are not back
by Thanksgiving,
we have agreed to... kill you.
Yeah, that's what's...
- Whooooo!
- Whooooo!
Donna, don't forget now,
because I want that recipe.
Football.
Don't forget football.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Okay. Hey, hey, hey, 4:30.
- 4:30.
- You know, 4:30.
- Open this door.
- You got the key, lady?
- No. Here.
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Hi, honey.
Joe?
- Get the boat?
- Check.
- Coupons?
- Check.
- Beer, gear, Dramamine?
- Check, check, check.
- Insert Billy "Catch" Pooler tape.
- Check that too.
We've gooone... fishin'!
"What on earth could make
a man happier"
"than O.F.H. in the G.O.M.?"
Hey, what's that stuff
you was readin'?
O.F.H., G.O.M.
What's that mean?
That's Optimum Fishin' Hour
in the Gulf of Mexico.
Hm, alligators.
Hey, Hey, Joe, listen to this.
"Alligators will attack their prey,
but not eat them immediately."
"Often, they will drag
their unlucky half-dead victim..."
"into their cave, where
they will let the carcass rot,"
"nibbling on them
at their delight."
And-and-and this too.
"Legend has it that
alligators are vengeful creatures."
"If threatened or disturbed,"
"they will become obsessed...
with their target, not resting"
"until they have successfully
unleashed their retribution."
- Ohh!
- Obsessed?
Yeah, obsessed, man. I mean,
they could follow you to the end o' the world.
Wow! Hey, check this out.
Boy, holy smokes. Hey, Gus,
we don't have to worry about that, right?
- We're gonna be fishin', right?
- Right, right, right, right, right.
Yeah. Hey, Joe,
it-it's-it's nice gettin' away, man.
Oh, yeah.
And the little one weighs 62.
Boy, that's somethin'!
- Yeah, she's pretty good, huh?
- It is a killer!
I-it's okay.
And it's got some fish.
Yeah. Hey, what kinda
fish is that?
- Ah, a grouper.
- Grouper, huh? And what's this?
That's a strawberry grouper.
Strawberry grouper, huh?
I thought it was a salmon.
It's like a salmon, don't it?
- Yeah, that's a strawberry grouper.
- What's this one, Gus?
- Kingfish.
- Kingfish, huh?
Yeah.
Hey, hey, Gus, if we had money,
we'd set this up different.
- We'd catch a lotta fish.
- Yeah, who needs it?
Yeah. Eh, guys who can't fish,
that's who needs that.
- Exactly.
- Yeah. Hey, hey, look at it this way, Gus.
You was a great football player, right?
Yeah.
If a great football player
got a bad-bad football,
- ... he's still a great football player.
- Exactly.
Hey, how 'bout this clean,
fresh... Florida air?
Hey... A real Florida palm tree
in the flesh.
Holy smoke! Gus, I never thought
I'd see a palm tree.
- I feel like a million dollars, Joe.
- Yeah, I feel like two million.
Let's go eat.
- And then fish.
- Yeah-yeah-yeah.
- No, no. You got the last one. It's on me.
- Forget about it.
Hey, hey, Joe, check out
them ugly sticks.
Hey, don't say that.
- They gonna break.
- You got number nine ready?
- Here you go.
- Let's sit over here. Hey, don't say that.
Hey, Gus, I can't fully believe you.
You tell me "Look at these ugly chicks."
I was gonna laugh right
in their faces over there.
I said "Ugly sticks".
For fishin'.
Oh, I thought you said "ugly chicks"
cause this girl's sittin' there.
You gotta have ugly sticks here
because they feed a lotta fishermen.
- Hiya.
- Hi.
- Y'all know what you want?
- Uh...
Hey, hey, Gus. What do you think, Gus?
Should I get this Southern Plate?
Then you can have
my... toast and my bacon.
Yeah, then I'll get the Fisherman's Feast,
and you can have my sausage and pancakes.
Well, if you're gonna do that,
why don't I  just get the Mariner
and you can have the whole side o' ham too?
Oh, never mind us.
This happens all the time.
- Yeah.
- Must be enjoyable for ya.
May I... may  suggest the Panama Platter?
It... really hit the spot.
Oh, yeah? Uh, thanks.
Um... what do you think?
Shall we get a couple o' those?
- Yeah, a couple o' those.
- Two o' those.
- A couple o' those, yeah.
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Gus.
- Yeah.
Check this out.
Pure Billy "Catch" Pooler.
- Watch this.
- Okay.
Back... drop.
- Back... drop.
- Y-y-you're flickin' too much.
- I can't get the flick. I go to those...
- O-okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me show you.
Which is the flick and
which is the dip?
It's in the wrist, you know? We... we...
Think of... flick instead of flip.
- Flick.
- Flick... dip.
See, I can't f... See, I get the flick
and the dip mixed all the time.
- Uh, pardon me.
- ... flick. Oh, sorry.
I couldn't help noticing, um...
You have a fishing lure on your key ring.
Yeah.
That wouldn't be
a deadly invader, would it?
It is!
- Hey, you fish?
- Not professionally.
You could call me
a frustrated amateur.
Yeah, you're a frustrated amateur.
- That's good.
- I just... I just kiddin'. Uh, just makin' a joke.
- It's a joke.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Uh, what about you two?
You're professionals, right?
Well, I guess
you could say that, in a way.
Uh, we're semipro. We won
a lotta, uh, fishin' medals and things like that.
- Not lately, though.
- Well, scout camp...
That counts, doesn't it?
Stuff like that.
Sorry. The reason I ask is, um...
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Oh. Eh.
- Do you mind if I join you?
- No, come on.
- Yeah.
- Eh.
Thanks.
You see, my father was
a professional fisherman.
- Really?
- He was telling me
that, uh, he was working
on the deadly invader.
You know, I think this might've been
one of his last original designs.
- Eh, by the way, I'm Joe.
- Oh, uh, Martin.
- How ya doin'?
- Martin Jeffries.
Gus. Yeah.
- Anyway... You two married?
- Uh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Children?
- No, they're our age.
No, no, I don't think
that's what he meant.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, no, I'm... You have children.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- They all get together.
- They're great kids, though.
Yeah.
- See, Fiona and I, we-we-we never had children.
- Oh, jeez.
Well, when Fiona died,
you know, I suddenly realized...
I'd wasted so much
of my life, you know?
- I'd spent 20 years behind a desk.
- That's a long time to be sittin'.
- You're 100% right.
- Right, Joe?
- I was always jealous of men like you.
- Really?
Yeah.
Of course, you know, uh, I'm changing
all that now, you know. My life' s different.
Listen, I-I won't hold you up.
Anyway, look,
it was a real honor meeting you.
- Hey, the pleasure's ours.
- Yeah, thanks.
Thanks so much.
And... good luck with the fishing, huh?
- Yeah.
- Hey, try fishin'. You'll see.
- I'll give it a try.
- All right. He's a nice guy, huh?
Hey, what kinda accent is that?
Polish or somethin'?
- I think that it is Irish.
- Yeah, Irish, Scottish.
Here. I'm glad y'all didn't buy
a bridge from that gentleman.
Why? He seemed like a nice guy.
He didn't try to sell us anything, you know?
- Seemed like a nice guy havin' a tough time.
- Oh, really?
The poor guy just recently
lost his wife, you know?
Yeah.
Did you know
you just recently lost your car?
Joe!
Hey, Gus, look at that.
There's a car just like mine!
Joe, that's your car!
It is! With my keys!
Hey, Joe!
Holy smokes!
It's simple.
When we find that guy who stole
my mom's money and broke her heart,
I'm gonna kill 'im.
- Food.
- What... What? What?
Food.
Oh, no. Come on.
We already lost two hours.
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?
Okay.
What happened?
Oh, we just had ourselves
a little boatin' accident.
Some fella stole a car.
- Ooh, big mess.
- Oh, yeah?
He didn't happen to look
like this guy, did he?
Well, that was him.
- He was here!
- Well, when did he leave?
- A couple hours ago.
- Was he alone?
When he got here.
Then he sat over at that table
with a couple of fellas and...
they chit-chatted for a while...
and he took their car.
Those guys whose car was stolen,
what about them?
Oh, you shouldn't have
any trouble findin' them.
My poor car, Gus.
My poor car.
My poor feet. Hey.
Hey, you dorks!
This trip ain't even a one.
It's a friggin' zero.
- It could be worse, Joe.
- How-how could it be worse?
You can't get any lower
than zero, right, Gus?
Hey, at least we're alive.
We almost got killed by our own boat.
My life stinks, Gus. But it stunk
a lot less when my car was in it.
- Yeah.
- That car meant a lot to me, Gus.
I got memories of that car
I can't even remember.
Yeah... but at least
we're goin' fishin'.
Yeah.
- He-hey, Joe?
- Yeah?
I-I was just thinkin'.
Say, 100 years ago we were goin' fishin'.
- This is what we'd be doin'.
- What do you mean?
Yeah... Think about it.
This is how we'd get
our boat to the water.
So we can't let that guy
ruin our Florida vacation, eh?
Hey, maybe you're right.
Yeah, and-and 1,000 years ago,
we wouldn't even have paved roads.
Hey, hey, that's right, Gus. Hey. It would be
filled with rocks and everything, right?
Y-y-yeah. And the boats
would be heavier.
Hey, that's right. Don't forget
we got the latest technology wood.
This boat's light, right, Gus?
Yeah, and... and guess what, Joe?
A million years ago,
we wouldn't even have
wheels for our trailer.
And we wouldn't even have
a friggin' trailer, right, Gus?
Yeah.
A-a-and, Gus, if it was that long ago,
our brains would be smaller.
We wouldn't even think e-e...
about anything like that.
Oh, man, yeah.
- So... it may not be a ten yet...
- Yeah.
... uhh, but it definitely ain't a zero.
Hey, hey!
- Hey, Gus, they're pullin' over.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey, Gus.
- Yeah?
- Babes.
You guys need a ride?
Gus, what kinda knot
did you tie?
A double shambo
figure eight.
You went over, under, over.
Eh, eh, eh, the shambo goes over, under, under.
- Hey... Joe, trust me. It's over, under.
- It's under, under.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey, you know, it's really nice
of you girls to give us a ride like this.
- We really appreciate it.
- Yeah.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
It's really too bad
about your car. I feel bad.
- We feel bad too, yeah.
- Yeah. Hm.
- Did you report the car stolen?
- Yeah, with the deputy.
Cause the sheriff was out fishin'.
Ain't that a bummer?
Y-you know the... You know
your license plate number, right?
Eh, that's the one thing
that Joe does remember.
- Yeah.
- That's right. Uh, "JGTT 542".
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Can you, uh...
- What is it? "J" what?
Could you do that again, yo?
Maybe I'll bump into
the police, and I can help you.
- Yeah, that's a great idea.
- Yeah.
- Thank you. That's nice of you.
- One more time.
- Uh, "J" for Joe, "G" for Gus...
- That- that-that's me.
"T"for tuna, "T"for trout...
"5". I was five years old
the first time I tasted beer.
Yeah.
And "42" was, uh, Gus's old football jersey
before he dislocated both his knees.
Yeah, but that's not
how I hurt my knees, you know.
I sleepwalk when I eat red meat.
- Sleepwalk?
- That's right. Hey, hey, listen to this.
Uh, one time at
a July 4th barbecue we had...
After it was over,
Gus sleepwalked all the way over
to the 7-11 on the interstate.
Got wiped out by a motorcycle.
Almost killed 'im.
Hey, true story,
I swear to God.
- It's a true story.
- Right, Gus?
- Yeah, right.
- Excuse us.
Hey, we'll talk to you later.
Hey, hey, you know, Joe?
Life is so unpredictable, man.
And one minute,
we're draggin' our boat,
next minute, we're gettin'
a ride with babes!
Hey, you know somethin' else?
I think they find us attractive.
- Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Notice that?
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, hey,
maybe they think we're cute.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Why-why not? What's wrong with us?
We have the license plate number.
We know that it's a blue Barracuda.
And if we see this guy,
we're going to call the police.
Yeah, of course we're gonna call the police,
what do you think?
Okay.
- Hey, hey, remember the killer looks?
- The what?
- The killer looks.
- Killer looks?
Oh, Joe! Your memory's so bad.
In high school.
I mean, we'd be sittin' in the bleachers
and givin' the killer looks
to Susan Dixon
and Marilyn Mitchell...
- Oh, yeah! Killer looks!
- Yeah, yeah.
What we gotta do is figure out
what to do with these guys.
You know what?
I was thinkin' of that low-down dir...
That's if, uh...
- Hi.
- Hi.
What's wrong?
You guys all right?
Oh, we're good, yeah.
Okay, well, um, look. Look, I just need
to ask you... The guy who stole your car...
Was he carrying anything? Like a...
like a... like black bag... or a suitcase or...
Uhh... i-it was... It looked
more like a purse to me.
Yeah, yeah, he was a man
with a purse, yeah.
Oh, yeah, wel-well, this guy
with the purse, did he maybe... you know...
like, tell you which way he was going
or something like that?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Uh, no. That's all we know, really.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
How come you're asking so many questions?
Yeah.
Well, it's because...
Well, the guy who stole your car...
No, no, the guy, no...
- Hey, hey, Joe, the beer!
- Gus! Get the beer, Gus!
- I got it, Joe.
- Get the beer.
Hey, Joe!
Hey, good save, Gus!
Good save!
Oh, Gus!
J...Joe!
Hey, Joe!
Hey, Joe!
Hey, hold on, Joe!
I'm comin'!
- Thanks, Gus.
- Hey.
Hey, Gus, I told you
it was under and under.
Yeah, okay, Joe.
Maybe you're right.
- Hey, nice RV, Gus.
- Yeah.
Hey, Gus, is there any way
to steer this thing?
I-I-I don't know. We better
find a way to stop it, though.
- Where'd they go?
- What?
They're... they're gone.
- The boat, the beer, everything. They're gone!
- Weird.
- Hey, Gus.
- Huh, yeah?
- The anchor.
- Get it, Joe. Throw it!
- Hey, Gus.
- Yeah.
- It was just like a ride.
- Hell, yeah.
Uh-oh...
Train!
- Hey, Gus, you pushin' or pullin'?
- Pushin'.
It's stuck on somethin'.
Joe, go get the fuckin'...
go get the anchor!
- Hurry up!
- I'm doin' it.
Hurry up!
Come on, move.
Boy, that was close, Gus.
You-you know
who I feel sorry for, Gus?
- Who?
- Hey, those girls. You know-you know, the babes.
Yeah.
I bet they're drivin' all around
lookin' for us, right?
Yeah, you're probably right, Joe.
Hey... Look at this setup,
um, Gus?
Where you guys headed?
Uh, we're goin' to the Everglades.
- Hop in.
- Hey, thanks.
I usually use
a 80-pound test line
with a Bluefin II 1955 stand-up rods,
with those uni-butts,
so I can pull it outta the rod holder
when the fish is pulling hard.
Do you anchor
or do you drift?
We usually power drift
along the break, if we can find one.
Yeah.
And we set each hook bait
with a different depth.
Man, we know a ton
of great fishin' secrets.
Last year, the Everglades
were like a feeding frenzy.
No way you weren't
gonna catch some beauties.
Oh, yeah, don't worry about your boat.
Ours is big enough for all four of us.
- Hey, Joe!
- Hey, Gus, that's my car!
Hey, stop!
Hey, we'll be all right now.
I got my car.
- Hey, where you guys headin'?
- Tigertail Lagoon.
All right, then.
- Hey, we'll see you there.
- Good luck.
- Guys are lucky, ain't they?
- Yeah. Oh, man, I know.
I wish I was them.
Hey, where is the guy
that, uh, parked this car?
- Yeah.
- He's in the john.
- What are you doin', Joey?
- He's gonna get a little piece of Newark, Gus.
- Oh, come on, Joey. It ain't worth it.
- It's worth it, Gus.
- No, it's not worth it!
- It's worth it, Gus!
- It's not worth it!
- It's worth it, Gus!
- Hey, what about O.F.H. first?
- It's worth it.
Oh, man.
Hey! Hey! Look
what you're doin' there.
Hey, what's going on
over there?
Joe, what about... O.F.H.?
Man, we still got time.
It's not worth it!
It's not worth it! He's got a gun!
- He's got a gun?
- He got a gun.
Shoot!
Come on, Joe!
He's got a gun!
Hurry up!
- Hey!
- Let's go!
Mister. Hey! It's against the law
to start your car while I'm pumpin' gas!
Oh, boy, that was close, Gus.
- Hey, hey, that guy could've killed us, Joe.
- I know.
Uh, uh, Joe, what happened?
I-I went in there. I was gonna
hit 'im with the club, see.
- Yeah.
- And-and he was lookin' for me.
- He was underneath the... the toilet.
- Yeah, yeah.
So I get up on top, and
the club gets caught on this, uh... uh, thing.
- I look, he's got a gun.
- You-you-you... Was it real?
Yeah... No, he's loadin' a water pistol.
Yeah, it was real!
So I ran outta there right
away, and I ran into you.
- Yeah.
- Where was you goin'?
Yeah. I-I was comin' in
to help you.
You comin' to help me...
As soon as I tell you it was a gun,
you was the first one in the car.
Yeah, yeah, that's why I ran first.
- I got longer legs, man.
- Yeah, yeah, you were scared, Gus.
What's goin' on?
I don't know, man.
God! There must be a fire
or somethin', huh?
- Yeah.
- Man.
- Yeah.
- Hey, Gus, do me a favor. Check in there.
See if this guy touched anything.
- I'll kill 'im if he touched anything in this car.
- Better not have touched our tapes.
Yeah, the tapes are in there too.
What's that?
- A knife.
- Holy smokes!
Yeah.
Hey, Gus, it looks like
it's got blood on it.
Sure does.
There's blood on it, Joe.
Hey, we could use it
to scale our fish.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
We'll use it to scale our fish.
Well, it feels good
to get the car back, Gus. I'll tell you that.
Smells good too.
- Yeah.
- Mm.
Holy smokes!
Look at this place, Gus!
- Yeah, this must be it, Joe.
- Yeah.
Uh, but that sign says
"Rod & Gun Club", Gus.
Oh. Glory Glades
must be a few miles away.
- Yeah, this ain't it, huh?
- Yeah.
- Eh, it's probably just as nice.
- Yeah. Hey, I-I bet it's even nicer.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Eh, eh, so far, Gus, eh... I-I don't like
the landscaping, I'll tell ya that.
Yeah, yeah. Somebody
ain't doin' their job, that's for sure.
Hey, this must be where the workers stay.
Let's ask somebody.
Yeah, let's go ask.
Sure doesn't look
like a paradise, Joe.
Howdy there, folks.
Can I help y'all?
Yeah, yeah, we're lookin'
for Glory Glades Lodge.
Yeah.
This here's it.
- This is it? Hey, no...
- No, no. Like-like here.
- Show him the coupon.
- See? Glory Glades.
- That Glory Glades.
- Ah, the lodge!
We got two coupons we won.
It was a beautiful lodge,
but... she's gone now.
Gone?
Hurricane Andrew flattened it
flatter than flat.
Took us ten months
to clean this place up.
But not to worry. We got plenty o' room.
Lemme see that coupon again.
Yeah, yeah.
Hm. Well, y' all can stay
in one of them... campers.
We gotta stay in there?
Both of us?
Why, that's a big camper.
There's room for four or five people in there,
and it's just the two of you, right?
- You ain't got no pets, have you?
- Hey, you ain't nothin' else?
Oh, that's the top o' the line there.
I don't think you want what else we got.
- I guess we'll go check it out.
- Yeah.
That's the top o' the line.
I just cleaned 'er out.
Hey, hey, gimme that!
Friggin' slob.
I-I'll tell you what, Gus.
I-it doesn't look anything like the picture.
Yeah, they should've sent us a new brochure
if they're gonna change the picture like that.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. They got a lotta nerve
callin' this first prize.
Eh, I wonder what the losers got.
Six months in Sing Sing?
- Yeah, maybe.
- Careful. Why don't you go first?
There might be rats
or somethin' in there.
- Yeah.
- You're bigger.
- Me?
- Go ahead.
It's okay. Come on in, Joe.
<i>The Maenads were frenzied followers
of this god of wine & vegetation.</i>
<i>- Richard?
- Who was Dionysus?</i>
<i>- Correct.
- Holidays and Observances for 100.</i>
<i>In 1915, President Wilson proclaimed this holiday
as the second Sunday in May.</i>
<i>Richard.</i>
<i>- What is Mother' s Day?
- Right.</i>
Yeah, change it.
- I-it's a stupid show anyway.
- Yeah, I know.
Hey, "Country's Criminals".
This is-this a good show.
- I like this one.
- Yeah, you see some action stuff here.
<i>I love you so much, Gladys.
I could not live without you.</i>
<i>- Honestly.
- Sure he could.</i>
<i>Gladys Sussner
is one of 43 women</i>
<i>who this ruthless con artist
married and then stole from.</i>
Wow, 43 ladies.
<i>And it was Gladys
who was found dead with stab wounds.</i>
<i>This man
is the prime suspect.</i>
- Hey, Gus, look who it is!
- Dekker Massey.
- It's the guy who stole my car!
- Yeah!
<i>Dekker's partner, his educationally
challenged brother Quentin...</i>
This guy's a killer,
and we didn't even know it.
<i>... charges, but the police
and the federal authorities</i>
<i>are still searching for Dekker Massey
and the murder weapon.</i>
Hey, we got the evidence.
- We don't have any evidence, Joe.
- We posted a 100,000-dollar reward...
It's a 100,000-dollar reward!
<i>... linking Massey to the crime.</i>
- Joe, the-the knife in the car!
- The knife! Yeah, with the blood on it.
Yeah, with the blood on it.
Maybe he used that to steal, eh...
to stab that poor old lady.
- Yeah.
- Holy smokes, Gus!
<i>And 5 million dollars
in cash and jewelry,</i>
<i>believed to have been hidden away
by Dekker's brother, is still missing.</i>
- Joe, Joe... we're gonna be rich, Joe!
- We're gonna be rich!
<i>- If you can help us, please call today.
- Gus, write down the number! Write down the number!</i>
- Write the number down!
- We'll be right back.
I don't believe it, Gus.
A hundred thousand dollars.
We're gonna be rich, Gus.
Uh, Joe, all we have to do is turn the kni-the knife in,
and we get the reward, Joe!
Hey, Gus, Gus! Hey,
you know what we'll do?
Eh, tomorrow we buy a fishing boat
first and go fishin'!
Yeah, we'll get a boat
just like our old one, Joe!
- Better! Better, Gus!
- Yeah.
- Joe, this is easy, baby.
- Oh, man, I can't believe it.
- Hey, no more worries, Gus.
- No more worries, Joe!
What's blank "shrugged".
Five letters, ending in an "s".
That'd be "Atlas",
as in "Atlas Shrugged" by Ayn Rand,
a Russian-born American writer.
Oh, yeah.
- Is the manager in?
- That'd be myself.
Yeah?
Wonderful. Listen.
I was wondering
if you're still honoring these.
What the hell is it with these...
damn coupons?
Why, has somebody else
been in with one?
Two fellas come in here last night.
- They still here?
- No, they gone this mornin'.
You know where they've gone?
They asked me
where they could buy a boat.
And... did you suggest a place?
Yep.
- Which place?
- Phil Beasly's.
Oh, it's nice, Joe.
It has a kitchen...
You know...
Hey, Joe, this is really nice.
- Hey, let me see.
- Hey, yeah, nice kitchen...
- Oh, yeah.
- Beds...
Yeah, but these are
pleasure boats, Gus.
- See?
- Oh, that's nice, Joe.
- They're not fishin' boats.
- Yeah, yeah.
- We don't need that.
- We don't need that.
The guys who can't fish get these.
They're show-offs.
They're pleasure... pleasure boats.
Hey, hey, here's one like our old one.
- Yeah.
- Holy smokes!
- Whoo!
- Why is it so expensive, Gus?
Because we bought ours used
20 years ago.
Yeah.
Yeah. Hey, hey, Joe, maybe
we oughta just fish off the dock,
like we used to do
in the old days... Yeah.
Hey, look, I don't care.
You wanna just rent one? We'll rent one.
Yeah, we can rent one.
We'll buy a real nice
used one when we get back home.
- It's sad, isn't it?
- What?
The Little Guy.
That's what we call this boat.
"The Little Guy."
- Ohh!
- Yeah!
Oh, cause, you mean, you got
all the big guys around... I see, yeah.
Right. Phil Beasly, Sr.
- Uh, Gus.
- Uh, Joe.
Yeah, the Little Guy's sad.
But you know what's sadder?
Follow me, guys.
The Little Guy.
Yeah, but maybe he'll show us
somethin' real nice.
Yeah.
- Watch your step here, guys.
- Yeah.
- Hey, how much further?
- Oh, just right up here.
I wanna show you guys
somethin' different.
All right.
- Something special.
- Yeah.
Most o' my customers
just shop the showroom.
Yeah.
But I can see you guys
are professional fishermen.
I'm sure you can judge
this boat in the water.
- Yeah, well, we're semipro, not professional.
- Yeah, you've probably won some awards.
- Yeah, we won a few.
- Yeah. Oh, we've won a lot of 'em.
Yeah, well, that's good.
Right here, guys.
- Hey, Gus, it's the, uh, Ranger 250C.
- Wow!
Yeah, the 250C. Let me tell you
what's sad about this boat.
A lot o' people look at this
and believe it's only a dream.
You fellas know anyone like that?
- Yeah, us.
- But there's nothin' wrong with lookin'.
Yeah.
Good point.
I cite this nudie photo
as a prime example.
- You men married?
- Yeah.
Then you'll understand me when
I say you're allowed to look.
- Yeah.
- That is the American way?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
You're allowed all the eyeballin'
your eyeballs can eyeball?
Yeah.
You're just not allowed to touch.
You're not allowed to play.
Well... I got good news
for you guys.
Go right ahead. Touch. Play.
- Excuse me.
- Eh, thanks a lot, Phil.
Yeah.
We might as well, Gus.
- It can't hurt none, right?
- Yeah, sure, sure. Oh, man!
- Wow, look at this.
- Man!
This is somethin'.
Hey, hey, how 'bout this guy? Eh, tryin'
to give us the old salesman pitch?
- With his nudie girl photo.
- Yeah, yeah.
He never saw a girl like
that in his life.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. He tried to pull one on us.
- Yeah.
- Guys?
- Yeah? Yeah?
Someone I want you to meet.
This is my assistant.
Julie, this is Gus and Joe.
- Hello, guys.
- Hi.
Uh... I'll sign those papers now.
Nice boat.
You guys look great in it.
- Yeah, thanks.
- I'm tellin' you, that baby's cryin'.
- Uh, screamin'.
- Yeah.
- No, no, the boat.
- Yeah, that's what I was talkin' about.
Yeah.
Let me tell you somethin', guys.
If I'm not honest with you,
I'm not lyin' to anyone.
I started this business because
I'm a fisherman and a boatman,
not because my time equals sales
plus commission minus overhead.
To me,
it's the people that matter.
- Yeah, people, yeah.
- Yeah. People.
I wouldn't want you to fall in love
with... uh, just for example...
a boat like mine.
That's the Waveliner II.
But she'd be... overkill for you, fellas.
- Yeah, overkill. Too much.
- Yeah, overkill.
The truth is, this boat you're
standin' in, the Ranger 250C...
Gentlemen, this boat...
Well... can you
just see the neighbors?
- Yeah, the neighbors.
- The neighbors.
- Wazinski.
- Yeah.
Can you just see them?
I'm tellin' you, that's
the best part of my job.
Not keepin' boats afloat, but keepin'
a man's self-image above the water.
- Yeah, self-image, yeah.
- Self-image, yeah.
Hey, y-y-y-you see... Phil, we were thinkin'
about buyin' the, uh, Little Guy?
- Yeah.
- But it's too, uh...
It's too, um...
- Cheap?
- Yeah, cheap, yeah. Yeah.
- Where you fellas fish?
- Glory Glades.
Hey, fellas, are you familiar
with the phrase...
"No one fishes Glory Glades"?
- No.
- I never heard that.
Guys, if you learn
anything from me today,
remember the two words...
Tigertail Lagoon.
- Hey. Hey, that's where Bubba and J. P...
- J. P., yeah.
We got a couple of friends
of ours fish over there. Yeah.
It's where I fish.
Here, have a pen.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Yeah.
- Phil, would you sign this for me?
- Oh, yeah. Gladly.
Are you guys okay?
- Fine, thanks.
- Yeah, fine.
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you, Julie.
Thank you, Julie. Uh, uh, Phil, you know...
uh, there's no way we can afford, uh...
Gus, prices are relative to your outlook
and how you approach a matter.
- For example. I say ten dollars.
- Yeah.
You say two. That's eight dollars
worth of play, my friends.
- Yeah, it's eight dollars.
- Yeah.
Can we not disagree
on somethin'?
- We can't... We can't disagree.
- No.
I think we reached that place already,
minutes ago. Now here's my point.
- And you can take this to the bank.
- Yeah.
Think for a moment
of the words "easy payments".
- Easy payments.
- Easy payments.
I'm talkin' 810 easy payments.
They're easy now... of 39.95.
- 39.95. That's not bad.
- No.
That's not bad.
Each. That's 39.95.
This boat, your boat. Think about it.
All we need is a signature,
and... you've already got a pen.
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.
What do you think? Are you thinkin'...
are yoy thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
- Yeah. Depends on... on what you're thinkin'.
- Yeah, well...
P.S. There's a 30-day
money-back guarantee.
So, it's a test-drive.
You don't like it... which you will...
you call, we come,
we pick it up.
End o' story, see you next time,
no questions asked.
- Hey, that's like free rent, Gus.
- Yeah.
So, guys, if you need anything...
I mean anything...
just say out loud
the word... "Phil"!
Excuse me.
- Hey, Phil!
- Hey, Phil!
Hey, Gus, d'you ever think in your whole life
that we'd own a boat like this?
Oh, man, no.
Look at the navigation, Joe.
- Yeah, yeah. What's this?
- That's the three-dimensional sonar.
Yeah.
Hey, Gus, I know we gotta
bring back the knife.
Yeah.
But do you think we could
get a little O.F.H. in first?
Yeah, we do a little O.F.H.,
then we take the knife back.
Hey, Gus, look at this!
Hey, a hundred yards due north.
Hey, look at all that fish activity!
Wow!
Hey, Joe,
they all around us, man!
- Hey, hey, we're surrounded by fish.
- Hey, hey, hey, we made it, Joe!
Hey, you know what, Gus? Eh, this is
the first time on this trip that, uh... life is good.
- Hey, a ten.
- A ten plus.
Hey.
Borderline 11!
I can't wait to try out
the new "flick dip", you know?
Flick... dip.
- What happened, Gus?
- You knocked me over with the flick.
- Gus!
- Oh, no!
Joe, look at
the fish activity here! Whoo!
- Hey, what-what-what-what?
- Look! Gus!
- Hey, it broke!
- Let go of the pole!
It broke.
Get off! Get off!
W-what's it say, Joe?
W-what's it say?
- I can't find it.
- Huh?
Ignition. Ignition.
Shut it down!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Slow down! Shut it off!
- Let me have it.
- It's broke! It's broke!
Eh, eh, try shuttin' the key off, Gus.
- Shut the what off again?
- Shut the key off!
- You broke it.
- Yeah, it broke.
Oh, sorry!
Oh, I feel bad, Gus.
Move out... move outta the way!
Move outta the way!
- Sorry.
- Hey, Joe, where are we goin'?
- Hey, J... J. P!
- Hey, it's J. P! Bubba!
- Oh, Joe!
- Oh, Gus!
- Joe, get in! Get in!
- Gus! Gus!
Joe, the knife! Get the knife!
Get it, get it, Joe. Get it!
- Gus!
- Get it!
Oh!
- I can't get it.
- Come on, Joe. You get it?
- Did you get it, Joe?
- No, I can't get it, Gus.
You couldn't get it, Joe?
Ohhh!
Gus, what are we gonna do?
We don't...
I don't know, Joe.
I can't believe it. I can't
believe we lost that knife.
- I... Me either. I can't believe it.
- That was everything to us.
- Everything.
- I know. Oh, we in big trouble, Joe.
Hey, there they are!
- Gus!
- Let's move!
Slow down!
Where are you goin'?
- Why are they chasin' us?
- I don't know why.
Uh, uh, look like
they're gainin' on us, Joe!
Get outta here! It's not our fault!
It broke! The thing broke!
Leave us alone!
We got enough problems!
Watch those bushes, Gus!
Watch out!
That's my boat!
- Hey, Phil!
- Hey, Phil!
Hey, Phil, we've-we've decided
to bring the boat back before the 30 days was up.
- Right, Joe?
- Yeah, yeah. Look, Phil, this stuff all broke.
- Eh, eh, you better get it all fixed.
- Yeah.
Thanks, anyway.
Yeah, thanks, man. You know,
hey, hey, you need better material.
Yeah. Sorry.
These guys are
a two-man disaster area.
They just bought a boat and destroyed it
in less than an hour.
Look... These idiots
won't get very far.
Now, they've got my map.
It might take me
another day to find them
but I will find them,
don't worry.
And when I'm finished with them...
I'll know where the money is.
We're gonna be working
every weekend for the rest of our lives, Gus.
How come?
Because that boat cost
more than our house.
At least we'll be home on time.
Wrong. We're gonna be home
a day earlier,
and that's worse than
gettin' there on time.
Besides, that friggin' knife is somewhere
at the bottom o' Tigertail Lagoon.
In any case, we're goin' home.
- Flat.
- Flat.
I got it, Gus.
- Hey, Gus.
- What?
- What's this?
- What's what, Joe?
Look, look. I-i-it looks like
a map of somethin'.
Joe... It's a map
to the money and jewels.
What jewels and money?
Joe, your memory's so bad.
You remember the 2 and a half million dollars
in stolen jewels and money
the guy on TV
said was hidden away?
- This is it?
- Yeah. Hey, who cares about the knife?
Hey, we get the reward anyway.
Hey, hey, hey, we-we got a map
to 2 and a half million dollars!
- Hey, hey, we're gonna get the reward anyway!
- We're gonna be rich!
- We're gonna be rich...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wai!
- Gus, Gus, Gus, listen! Gus, Gus! Listen.
- Yeah. What?
Listen. Hey, who cares
about the reward is right.
Forget about the reward. Let's just take
the 2 and a half million in money and jewels.
We're millionaires!
Millionaires, Gus! We're rich!
Joe, that guy stole that
from 43 women.
That's a whole lotta broken hearts.
Yeah, i-i-it's not nice. We wouldn't like it
if it was somebody in our families.
- We can't take it.
- But think, Joe.
Not only is it... a lot o' women.
That means a lot o' rewards.
It's a lot of rewards!
It's more than one reward.
- We're rich! We're rich!
- We're gonna be rich.
- We're gonna be rich.
- We're rich. That's right.
Instead of one reward,
we get a bunch of rewards.
We're really rich now.
A-and we're picking up...
We're goin' fishin'!
- Holy smokes! Look at this place, Gus.
- Oh, yeah.
Hey, hey, Gus, Gus. You check us in,
and I'll give the guy the car.
All right.
Hey, Joe, this is us. I can feel it.
Welcome to the Rod & Gun Club.
Will you be checking in this evening, sir?
- Yes, I am.
- Can I help you with your bags?
- I only got one bag.
- All right.
And I'll get it myself.
It's okay. It's-it's just an overnight bag.
- Here's your hat, sir.
- Oh, that stays here.
- Okay.
- Enjoy your stay.
Yeah. Careful with this car.
Good evening, sir.
Hi.
- Hey, hey, Joe, don't... don't do that, man.
- You were scared, huh, Gus?
It's dead.
You were scared.
I'm... sorry, gentlemen.
There are no rooms.
The only room available is
the, uh, Presidential Suite.
We'll take it.
The, uh, Presidential Suite...
is at a rate of
850 dollars per evening.
Oh, yeah, we'll, uh...
So, uh,
we'll take it per evening.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, Gus, this is pretty cool.
They give us, uh, rich people's
clothes to wear, huh?
Yeah, we better get used to it, Joe.
We'll be doing this a whole lot, man.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't I try that pink one on, Gus?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It might fit a little better.
- Yeah.
- Cause that's big.
- Yeah.
I like the blue one better, Gus.
I like the pink one too.
It looked better on me.
The blue one
looks great on you.
- Yeah, this is good.
- Yeah, it looks good.
Yeah, this is good.
Let's go eat.
... chicken praline.
- Excuse us.
- Yes. Ahem. Excuse me.
Gentlemens!
Very nice to see you tonight.
You look very nice.
- Very nice.
- Thank you.
My name is Kirk.
I am your waiter. K-I-R-K.

- Hey, I'm Gus.
Gus. Nice to see you, Gus.
Nice to see you tonight.
- Nice place, Joe.
- Thanks.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.
- Excuse me, sir.
- It's good.
Eh, eh, look. I see somethin'
I want already.
I'm gonna have the halibut.
You can have my tomatoes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I'll have the New York strip.
You can have my vegetables here.
Eh, eh, Gus, Gus, I ain't takin'
your vegetables, cause you ain't havin' steak.
What?
I ain't stayin' in a room with
no back-from-the living-dead zombie
sleepwalking freak.
Hey, hey, hey, Joe, it's gonna be
all right. Hey-hey, Kirk.
Yes?
He's gonna have the halibut.
I'm gonna have the New York strip.
- Oh, Gus, don't.
- Very nice.
- I'll be all right, Joe.
- Okay. To drink?
Yeahh, yeahh, the drink. Let's see, uh...
Somethin' special.
Yeah, it's a special occasion.
We'll have some, some wine.
Some wine? Yes.
Red? White?
- Wait, wait. Somethin' good, Kirk.
- Okay, very good. Very... Welcome. Welcome.
That guy gets so excited.
Nice guy.
- He makes me excited, man.
- This is great stuff.
- This is a... borderline 11!
- Borderline 11!
Shhh!
- What are they lookin' at?
- Yeah.
- I don't know, Rita. I don't see anything.
- Did you find anything?
Just these.
- Pork rinds, ugh!
- Healthy.
Bunch of fishing magazines,
some half-smoked, ugh, bad cigars and...
this, uh, pen from...
"Phil Beasly' s Boat Emporium."
A'it. Look, ladies, you gotta stop, okay?
Party is over.
I could lose my job.
That's it. Okay?
Hey, that's why I gave you 20 dollars.
Now, the guy who was driving this car,
where is he?
Do you know where he is?
Rita.
Is he your husband or something?
No, he's not my...
Do you know where he is?
Most likely,
he's in the dining room, okay?
"Dirt road.
Chokoloske Road.
Go along the bank.
Sign for Snickerson's."
Lemme see that, Joe.
Gentlemens,
I've gots the wine for you.
Huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey, that's, uh...
What are we supposed to say, Kirk?
You're supposed to say
"Kirk, that looks good to me."
Kirk, it looks good to me.
Yeah, me too, Kirk.
It looks real good to me.
It's imported.
- There.
- That's it?
Hey, Kirk, I'm not exactly a little kid,
you know. I can drink a full glass.
He gave me a little stuff like that.
- I know. More, more, more.
- That's more like it.
- Gimme a whole glass too, Kirk.
- Okay.
Hey, Kirk.
Do you know where this is?
Yes, that is Snickerson's.
That's about 20 miles south of here.
- Oh, thanks, hey.
- Okay? Okay. Okay. Enjoy, gentlemens.
It's 20 miles south o' here, Joe.
That's all, man.
We're in great shape.
Huh? Hey, Gus, do you think
you should show Kirk that map?
- He didn't know what it was.
- Ehh...
Maybe you're right, Joe.
We gotta be extra careful now.
- Oh, my...
- To not screwin' up, Joe.
- Hey, to not screwin' up, Gus.
- Hey. Hey, Joe!
- Yeah?
- Hey, hey, look! The girls!
Hey, it's the girls
that gave us the ride.
Beautiful ladies... for
the very nice gentlemens.
- Hi, Angie. Uh, thanks, Kirk.
- Hi.
- This is great.
- Sit down. Sit down.
We didn't know
what happened to you guys.
No, we just turned around,
and you were, like, gone.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, you know what happened?
Eh, the boat slipped off.
- Eh, Gus tied, uh... the shambo wrong.
- I-I missed a knot.
- Yeah, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
Eh, we're celebratin'
gettin' my car back.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And, uh, where's the guy?
- Uh, the guy?
- Yeah.
- The guy that took the car?
- Uh-huh.
Eh, we just left him there.
Did he leave anything in the car?
You know, like a... bag or papers or...
- A knife, knife...
- A knife?
- A knife?
- Yeah, a knife.
- Yeah, but we lost... we lost the knife.
- What?!
- Yeah, we had a boatin' accident.
- Yeah.
- So...
- So?
Like, did he leave
maybe a clue or something?
You know, where
he might be going, a tip?
H-h-hey, how come you girls
are so interested in this guy?
Hey, le-let's put our cards on the table.
You're after the reward, right?
Oh, we could care less about
the reward, believe me.
Yeah, they know about
the reward, I think.
- Hey, cause we were watchin' "Jeopardy"...
- Yeah.
You guys watch "Jeopardy"?
Yeah. Hey, they take away Science,
I'll kill' em.
- Yeah. I'll kill' em if it weren't for History.
- Yeah, that's right.
Anyway, then we put on
"This Country' s Criminals",
- Yeah...
- ... and we saw this guy.
Yeah.
And that's what you want.
You want the reward.
Yeah.
We just want the guy caught.
- Right.
- Hey?
I don't care about the reward.
We don't, do we?
- No.
- And what did he do to you?
Yeah.
Look, is... My father...
he died almost 12 years ago,
and my mom...
uh, she's been alone all this time
until she met this guy, Dekker.
- Yeah, that's the guy.
- Yeah.
Well, anyway, he charmed 'er
and then he married her...
and... then he took everything.
Everything.
He skipped town
with her whole life savings.
- And it broke 'er heart... you know?
- Yeah.
And he could have killed 'er
like that other woman, you know?
Hey, hey... Hey, come on.
It's okay.
Honey, please do't do that, don't cry.
It's gonna be okay, right?
The cops are gonna
take care of everything. Right, guys?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
Eh, did you have dinner?
Hey, we-we didn't eat yet, you know?
Why don't you eat with us?
- Yeah, join us for dinner.
- Yeah! Yeah, that's a great idea.
Like... you're really
on a vacation, right?
Champagne?
Champagne. Very nice.
Come on, come on, come on!
Yeah! Come on, come on,
come on, come on!
Bubble, bubble.
Hey, Gus?
Gus?
What time is it?
How come you're up so early?
It feels like I just went to bed.
Hey, Gus?
Hey, you okay, Gus?
Gus, you okay? Hey, Gus,

Uh-oh.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
You're sleepwalkin', Gus.
Gus, you're sleepwalkin'.
Gus, you are!
I need water.
- Gus, God, I need water!
- All right, Tommy, I'm on my way.
Gus, you ain't never
eatin' meat again!
No more steak, ever!
That's it!
The phone. Hello?
<i>I have received a report
of some noise.</i>
Where, in this room?
Uh, no way. No way.
- I-I-I'll call you back.
- I'm leaving, Cookie.
- I gotta go. Gus!
- See you tonight.
Gus!
Hello?
Whooaahh!
Gus!
Gus!
Gus! Gus!
Hello?

- Is everything all right?
Gus, will you wake...
Gus!
Gus! Gus!
Wake up, Gus!
Hello?

- Joe! Joe, what are you doin'?
You're sleepwalkin' again,
you jerk!
- Gus, our room!
- What?
- That's our room!
- What?
- The map, Gus.
- What?
That's our room on fire.
It's our room. It's our room!
Eh, the map is gone and everything.
Out of a sleepwalkin'. You were sleepwalkin'!
How... how-how did you know
I was sleepwalkin'?
You weren't fishing.
You weren't sleepin'.
- You were sleepwalkin'.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, valet!
We gotta get outta here.
- Hey, I get... Get our car for us.
- What happened?
- Blue, uh, Barracuda, '68 Plymouth.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hurry up!
- And don't... Go, go, go, go, go.
- Don't worry about the fire.
- They'll fix it.
- Yeah.
- Hey, what are you doin' now?
- Leave the girls a note.
Yeah, okay, yeah, that's good.
Okay. And tell 'em we're gonna
meet 'em at Snickerson's Landing.
- How many K's in Snickerson's?
- Uh, just... one, Joe.
- Yeah.
- There's a shack around there too, right?
- Yeah.
- They should know about the shack.
Hey, give this note to the...
to the girls in the El Camino, remember?
Rita and Angie. A pretty girl. Hey,
I'll give you a big tip when I come back.
Hey-hey, come on, Joe!
- Okay, I'm comin'. Okay?
- You're leaving' em again?
Yeah. Hey, excuse me.
Joe, all that starin'
at the map before dinner
and all you remember
is Snickerson's?
Hey, Gus, it was
a complicated map.
Your memory's so bad
it's amazing.
I-I'll tell you what's amazing, Gus.
I-it's how you walk around
while you're sleepin'. That's amazing.
Oh, well, well, just try
to remember the map, okay?
I'm sorry if I don't have
a photographic memory, Gus.
- You don't even have a memory.
- Hey, you wanna talk about memories?
Eh, do you recall
settin' a hotel room on fire?
For Rita and 'er mother,
just try to remember the map.
Okay? Think.
- Well? What?
- I'm tryin'.
- Gimme a chance.
- Okay.
I can't remember nothing, Gus.
Let's just go home.
No, no, we're gonna find
the money.
No, I'll tell you where we're going.
We are going...
Nowhere.
It could be worse, Joe.
- What?
- It could be worse.
Hey, Gus, please don't say that, okay?
Cause, uh, it can't get any worse.
I mean... I'm so sick of, like, every time
that we... we get in trouble,
if somethin' goes bad, we think of, like,
worse situations just so we could say
"Ehh, you know, this ain't so bad.
It could be a lot worse."
- All I said...
- Hey, Gus. The truth is, it can't get any worse.
Hey, Joe!
Joe?
- Yeah.
- Hey-hey, Joe!
Yeah...
I-it just got worse, Gus.
What?
What do you mean, what?
You saw the lightning. You know what happens.
Joe, what are the chances
of you gettin' hit by lightnin' again?
Hey-hey, Gus, what were the odds
the first time I got hit?
And what about the odds
the second time I got hit?
Hey, hey-hey, Joe. If I could fix the car,
I'd do it myself.
Besides, that's the worst place
you could be is behind a tree.
Yeah, you see? I mean, I can't...
I can't fix the Barracuda, man.
So let's just fix the Barracuda
and go find the money. All right?
Hey, come on, here.
I me... Oh, come on, Joe,
don't be silly.
Hey, Gus, I'm tryin' to be intelligent
about this, you know?
What do you mean,
you're tryin' to be intelligent?
You're being silly, man.
Nothin'-nothin's gonna happen!
Hey-hey, Gus, it hurts to get hit by lightning,
you know. You don't know what it feels like.
Hey, Joe, watch. Uh, look.
Hey... Hit me! See?
Hit me! You see?
Right here. See? Right here...
See what I mean?
Hey, here I am!
You got... you got a free shot!
Take it! Right here! Hit me!
See wha...
See what I mean, Joe?
- Yeah, it's a little silly.
- Yeah.
Here, here.
Let's go fix the car.
There. See?
Here.
Whoo. Whoo-hoo!
Uh-huh.
Hey, Joe!
Joe! Joe?
Joe, talk to me. Joe, talk to me.
Joe, I-I di... I didn't mean
to talk you into doin' it, Joe.
Oh, I should've listened to you!
I said nothing's gonna happen,
and it happened.
A-a-all-all the lil' guy
wanted to do was go fishin'.
Is that askin' too much?
Ain't nothin' wrong with that, is there?
Oh, he-he's a... he's a good guy.
I mean, he's a good guy.
The best.
Joe, we all love you.
Joe, Joe, Joe.
Hey, Gus,
I remember the map.
Snickerson's Airboat Rentals.
Left, right, right,
left, left, right, right.
Channel number 27,
11 paces to the big tree
- ... underneath the water nest.
- Yeah.
That's where the treasure lies,
where Mad Maggie rests.
- Hey, hey, we're gonna be rich!
- We're gonna be rich!
We're gonna be rich.
Gonna be rich, gonna be righ...
He was not there, and
they don't want to talk to me.
- What happened here?
- A fire.
I can see it was a fire.
How did it start?
Two guys from up north
blew up their rooms.
You don't say?
One tall, one short, in a blue car?
Yes. Yeah. I, uh...
I... wait on the tables
for, uh, the tall and the small one.
They say
where they were going?
The tall one...
he come to me and he said...
He showed me a map,
and he want to know
where was Snickerson's.
- Airboats.
- So I...
- Gotcha.
- So I...
If you see them,
you tell them
that I love them very much
and I want to see them again
and that they're very nice,
very attractive boys.
You sure
we're goin' the right way?
Yeah, there's the arch, Gus.
We gotta go under that arch and turn right, Gus.
Eh, we should be able to see
the island once we get past this gutter.
What's the next landmark?
We gotta go right,
and then, eh, there's twin trees.
Yeah, I can't wait
to get there.
- Sure scary in here, Gus.
- Yeah.
- What's that? That's a log over there?
- That's only a log.
- Oh, okay. Here.
- It's only a log.
- We goin' through the arch?
- Go through this arch, then we go right.
Eh, straight through there, Gus.
That's it!
- Okay, straight, Gus.
- We're on our way, Joe.
It's a lot of work,
but it's gonna be worth it, Gus.
Eh, i-it's-it's the palm tree
with nothin' on it.
Eh, we make a left here and then
there's a tree with a flower on it, Gus.
That's it, Gus. Hey, look! Eh, there's a tree
with a flower on it. That's it.
- That's a pretty flower.
- That's it.
And there's the cave, Gus.
It just said watch out for Mad Maggie.
Who's Mad Maggie?
Eh, it was just somethin' on the map,
ehh, probably to keep people away. Scare 'em.
Mad Maggie.
Keep them away. Yeah.
- C'mon, Gus.
- All right.
Eh, we're gonna be rich.
That's the cave, huh?
- That's it, Gus.
- Yeah.
I remembered everything.
I can't believe it.
Well, this is the cave.
Well, the cave is inside.
This is the hole, though.
This is the hole, yeah,
that's right.
- Yeah. It's kinda dark in there, Joe.
- I got a light for you, Gus.
- For me?
- Well, I figured, uh, you should go in first, Gus.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Because, uh, I know I can fit in this hole,
- but, uh, we wanna make sure you get in here.
- Yeah, that's right, that's right.
Right?
Lemme have that.
Hey, you're not scared, are you, Joe?
Eh, no. Hey, Gus, I'll go.
Oh, no, no, no, that's all right.
I know-I know you're... not.
- Cause I'm not scared, Gus.
- Okay. You just watch out.
- I just wanna get the money.
- Yeah, okay.
- All right?
- The jewels are right in there.
I wonder what
this Mad Maggie stuff is about.
- What?
- Nothin', nothin'. Okay.
- Easy now.
- Here it... How is that, Gus?
Yeah.
It's hard to see.
Joe, over here in front o' me.
Hey, you sure?
Yeah, my eyesight gets bad
when I get in close places.
- What you see?
- I don't see nothin', Gus.
- It stinks in here, doesn't it?
- It ain't me.
It smell like rotten meat.
Hey, Gus.
There's somethin' back there, Gus.
- Look at this. See that?
- Yeah, I see it.
- Eh, it's a case.
- Yeah.
This is it.
Hold this, Gus. Hold it.
You got it?

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

- Oh, that's it, Joe!
- Holy smokes! Hey, we're gonna be rich, Gus.
- Yeah.

We're gonna be rich.
We did it, Gus. We did it.
What are you shushin' me for?
I didn't shush you, Joe.
Come on. Let's go.
- You didn't shush me?
- No, I didn't shush you.
Mad Maggie!
Let-let go of it! Let go!
Watch it, Gus! Gus!
What the heck are you doin'?
I can get it, Joe.
I can get it.

Get this out! Get it out!
Pull harder, Joe!
Hey, you're crazy, Gus!
I got it, Joe!
Hey, what do I do now, Joe?
Hey, Gus, be careful!
Let it go.
Spin 'im around, Gus.
I'll kick 'im in the nuts.
He's a she, Joe.
And she ain't got no nuts.
Get 'er, Joe, get 'er!
Harder, harder, Joe, harder!
- Come on, Gus!
- Let's get outta here.
- Holy smokes! Look at that, Gus.
- We did it, Joe.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
You know, Gus, there's a lot
of family heirlooms here.
Those poor people.
that's not nice.
- Yeah, a lot of "hairlooms" in there, yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey, w-we're gonna get
reward money, anyway.
- Hey, we're gonna be rich.
- Yeah, and famous.
Oh, really?
- Now... move!
- Yeah.
- Move!
- Okay, I'm movin'. I'm movin'.
- Yeah.
- I'm movin'. I'm movin'.
- What's he doin', Joe?
- I don't know, Gus.
Rugby-playin' jerk.
I'd like to get 'im on a football team.
- Now push.
- What?!
- Just push the car!
- Hey!
I've wasted a lot o' time
looking for you two.
Now, you do what I say.
Hey, Gus, it's all right, Gus. It's all right.
Don't... don't get in trouble, Gus.
- Bet he can't play no football.
- Push the car!
- I just can't.
- Push the car!
He said he's gonna push!
Now just back off!
Do you want me to put
a bullet through his head?
- No, he's gonna push.
- Do it now.
- Push, Joe. Joe, you gotta push.
- Gus, I can't.
- I know, I know.
- He scared me.
I know, Joe.
It's tough, man. It's tough.
- Oh, Gus.
- It's tough.
My car, Gus.
You'll get another one, Joe.
You two wouldn't understand.
I really deserve that money.
I made those women feel like
somebody really loved them, you know?
Believe me, it wasn't easy.
I deserve every penny.
So, you just sit there...
and think about me going off
to a life of... wealth and luxury
while you've only got your dreary little
poverty-stricken lives to go back to.
But I'm sure you'll enjoy
spending Thanksgiving here together.
Oh! What? Have I ruined
your plans for the holidays?
Oh, I am so sorry.
You think you're so big.
A big tough guy
pickin' on women.
- You go rob women.
- Hey, Joe.
You beat up on 'em
and kill 'em and stuff.
- Shut up, Joe.
- I'm not scared o' him, Gus.
It's who he is.
Eh, you wanna fight everybody.
Why don't you join the army
if you wanna fight?
Eh, go join the Marines,
fight with them. See how tough you are.
- Hey, Joe, don't make 'im mad.
- He made us push my car in that swamp.
Thanks a lot,
creep, creep, creep, creep.
- You're a creep.
- Yeah.
- Creep, creep...
- Joe!
Creep, creep...
J-J-Joe! Tell him you're sorry, Joe.
Hey, le-let 'im go. He-he-he didn't mean it.
He didn't mean it. Do-don't hurt 'im.
Joe, tell 'im you're sorry.
You're hurtin' 'im.
Tell 'im you didn't mean it, Joe.
You're hurtin' 'im.
Hey, he-he's sorry.
He said he's sorry.
Hey, hey! Joe! You're gonna kill 'im!
Joe! Don't kill 'im! Don't kill 'im...
You know, for an insignificant,
ignorant little man,
you've got
a really big mouth.
Now shut it.
You all right, Joe?
Joe, I hate that guy.
Now, I'd love to stay
and chat with you, but, uh...
I've got a plane to catch.
You know, you two should
really grow up.
You've got
children of your own, you know?
Now that is
a really scary thought.
I could kill you now,
but it's not worth it.
The alligators
will probably get you.
Big tough guy when
we're tied up, huh, Gus?
Yeah. Yeah.
- When we can't do nothin'.
- I know.
- Lucky we were tied, right, Gus?
- Yeah, it's lucky we were tied.
What's wrong with us
anyway, Gus?
I mean, eh-eh, eh, we-we work hard, uh,
we've got great families
and kids
and beautiful wives.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We work hard. We go to church...
Eh, we like to do is fish.
We don't bother nobody.
Yeah, we're lucky, Joe.
Why does everything
go wrong around us?
Cause we're lucky, Joe.
- We're lucky?
- Yeah, you-you said it all, Joe.
We got great families.
We got kids. Our wives love us.
You know?
We go to church. We work hard.
- All we do is wanna go fishin'.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I never thought of it like that.
- Yeah, but that's...
- We are lucky, huh, Gus?
- We're lucky. We're lucky.
- Yeah.
We can't help it if everything
goes wrong around us.
- Yeah, it ain't our fault.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Hey, Gus, you think he's comin' back?
- No.
It sounds like
somebody's gonna rescue us, Joe.
Hey, you remember
that movie "Deliverance"?
Sounds like those guys.
Joe, I don't wanna squeal
like a pig.
I don't wanna squeal
like a pig, either, Gus.
- Hey!
- Gus!
You know
who I think it is, Gus?
Yeah, it's Catch Pooler, Joe.
It's him.
I can't believe it.
- Oh, it's Catch Pooler.
- Yeah, that's Catch.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Hey, Catch.
Catch, yeah.

- Yeah.
Are you all right?

You know that's Catch.
Hey, Catch, Joe Waters.
Joe.

Hey, we-we won your contest,

"Why you wanna fish
in the Everglades?"
Yes, sir, I know that.
- He knows.
- But remember...
- Yeah?
- Don't ever forget.
The canary sings...
but the eagle flies.
- The canary sings.
- The canary sings.
- The eagle flies.
- The eagle flies.
Hm, there must be
some hidden meaning there, Gus.
Yeah, that's-that's...
- Right?
- Yes.
Hey, Catch,
uh, see my car over there?
- Yeah.
- This guy's so mean.
He made us push my car in the water.
Eh, we really wanna get this guy.
Eh, he said he's gonna take a plane.
He's gotta catch a plane.
Yeah.
Well, there's no airport
around here for miles.
- There's not?
- We don't know what to do.
Hey, hey, Catch,
we gotta catch 'im.

That's it! It's gotta be!
Hey, hey...
Joe, what are you doin'?
Eh, we'll take this boat.
We'll follow the plane, Gus.

It's a seaplane! Come on, Gus,

We'll follow it.
Yeah, I-I-I know he knew.
I know he knew! I know that!

Gus, this guy wrecked our boat.
He... Look what he did to my car!
Hey, Gus, he tried to kill us.
Eh, he embarrassed me, Gus.
I don't know about you,
but he made me cry.
I don't feel much like a man, Gus.
I thought you would

- Swigging bones. What's that?
There they are! The girls!
The girls, Gus. Hey,

How's it feel

I'm not talking to you
or anybody about anything.
Hey, you got any
identification?
Hey, Joe, he's got a uniform.
Give 'im the bag.
Joe!
Hey, you look so good.
Thank you so much.

That was so great. That was so great.
I couldn't believe it.
I mean, when you hit the highway...

- What did it say?
- Snickerson's.
- Yeah.
- Snickerson's.
- Snickerson's. We looked for you.
Yeah, yeah, cause the room blew up,
and I didn't know if we'd see you again.
I know. What was that about?
That was so scary.
- Gus was sleepwalking again.
- Again?
WIN TV. We're set up

You didn't have to tell 'em
I was sleepwalkin'.

Those guys were so great.
I mean, they did everything for us.

He deserves to go in jail
cause he's hurt so many people and...
Yeah, it's true.

You know, Joe,
after we pay
for the... Ranger 250C,
replace our boat,
fix the Barracuda...
- Joe, do me a favor.
- Yeah, Gus, I'd do anything for you.
- You know that.
- I-I know that.
Stop smokin'.
I-I-I want you to stop smokin'.
Uh, for me, your wife, your family,
everybody. We love you, man.
- Okay?
- Okay, Gus.
- All right.
- Eh-eh-eh!
Did you forget?
Yeah. Pay for the resort fire,
our gear, and food, clothin',
flight home...
we have a grand total
of 42 dollars profit.
Yeah, at least
we made it home on time, Gus.
Yeah...
to the wife and family.
They were happy about that.
- Hey, you know what's great, Gus?
- What, Joe?
After bein' here, you realize you don't have
to go far away to live the good life.
You-you-you sure do. You realize, you know,
it's right in your own backyard, Joe.
- That's right. I love it.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hey, Gus, you know what we should do?
- What?
Let's do like we used
to do in the old days and take a dip.
- It's cold, Joe.
- Yeah.
Eh, what about that, uh,
Polar Bear Club in Coney Island?
Those guys go in the water
in a... freezing weather.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I-I heard about that.
It is good
for your heart and everything.
- Wanna try?
- I'll do it if you do it.
- I'll do it if you do it.
- Just a quick dip.
A quick dip.
- Hey, hey, Gus, this is gonna be great.
- Yeah, it's gonna be a ten, Joe.
- Ten plus.
- Hey...
Borderline 11!
Hey, Gus, what-what are you
shushin' me for?
I ain't shushin' you, Joe.
- You didn't shush me?
- No. You didn't shush me, did you?
