I don't believe this shit.
Six months without a weekend...
the goddamned transporters
are five minutes late.
And that's five minutes of R and R
I ain't never gonna get back.
Hey, relax, baby.
We're on vacation.
Yo.
This game's layered, man.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Destroyer]</font> Where you going, Portman?
- I'm going down to El Honto...
and I'm gonna lock myself
in a motel room...
with a bottle of tequila
and three she-boys.
You're sick, man.
- I'm sick of your filth, Portman.
- He speaks. Hm.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Duke]</font>
What's it gonna be, Reaps?
An armed conflict someplace quiet?
<font color="#FFFF80">[Portman]</font>

gonna stay right here.

Listen up, men.

Oh, man. I just...
I don't believe this shit.
- Fuck!
- Got a problem with that, Duke?
Me, Sarge?
Hell, no, I love my job.

- <font color="#FFFF80">[Kid]</font> Shut up, Portman.
- Not this time, John.
- What?
- We can handle this one.
- You're bullshitting me.
No, I'm not bullshitting.
We're going to Olduvai.
Olduvai?
- Take the leave.
- Is that an order?
It's a recommendation.
See you when I get back.
- <i>Aircraft ready to load.</i>

I asked Sarge for a little pussy.
The next day he brought you

<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font>
Don't give me an excuse, Portman.
No one here will miss you.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
Men, look in.
This is what we got from Simcon.
We have a quarantine situation
on Olduvai.
They sent this message...
when the research team stopped

UAC have shut down the lab, men.
We need to go up there,
locate the team...
eliminate the threat
and secure the facility.
What threat?
It goes like this, see:
If it's trying to kill you, it's a threat.
<i>Rescue mission heading 147 degrees.</i>

<i>Roger, Q-06.

Why can't UAC rent-a-cops

Is it always that rough?
Believe me,
it used to be a lot rougher.
There was a time when Ark travel
was susceptible to, let's say...
- major turbulence.
- What's he mean?
He means he went to one galaxy,
his ass went to another.
Call it a scientific miscalculation.
Unbelievable as it may seem,
UAC does make the odd tiny mistake.
Marcus Pinzerowsky.
You call me Pinky. Follow me.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font> Where are the personnel
who aren't locked down in the lab?
In the atrium.
Pinky, put us up.
Activating remote
personnel surveillance.
Circle out men,

One, two, three.
Killcams up and running.
People, this room is a code red,
which means...
no one gets in without our permission.
It stays ours at all costs.
Mac, stay here with our friend
and secure the door.
Men, on me.
Let's move out.
Open the doors.
<font color="#FFFF80">[UAC personnel]</font>
Who called in the military?
Where the fuck are we?
Couple million light years
from breakfast.
When can I start evacuating
people out through the Ark?
We're at a Level 5 quarantine,
nobody goes anywhere.
Ladies,
we're under a Level 5 quarantine...
so I'm just gonna have to
strip search you girls.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Woman]</font> I don't think so.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Portman]</font> Hold that thought.
We're under a Level 5 quarantine,
so I'm just gonna have...
- to strip...
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font> Portman!
<font color="#FFFF80">[Hunegs]</font> Sergeant, this is Doctor
Samantha Grimm, the UAC science officer...
<font color="#FFFF80">[Hunegs]</font>
assigned to retrieve data from the lab.
- Sergeant.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font> Dr. Grimm.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font> Hello, John.
- Hello, Samantha.
Hello, Samantha!
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font>
Sarge, this operation is a code red.
We really don't have room for passengers.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font> Excuse me, but I have orders
to retrieve data from three servers:
Anthropology, Forensic Archeology,
and Genetics.
This is a military operation, Doctor.
We're really not here
to retrieve your science homework.
Look, I got an idea. Why don't you
ask your CO what your orders are?
To contain and neutralize the threat,
protect the civilians...
and retrieve...
retrieve UAC property.
We finally done here?
Because I've got a job to do.
- If you'll follow me?
- You chose this, Reaper.
- Is this gonna spoil my day?
- No, sir.
Tell me you didn't let
a fine-looking piece of ass...
- like that get away from you, Reaper.
- She's my sister.
- No shit?
- <font color="#FFFF80">(peeved)</font> Don't do this again, man.
Do what?
There's three sections
to Carmack's lab complex.
Archeology, Genetics,
and Weapons Research.
- You test weapons up here?
- Well, it's a dead planet.
You want that stuff tested here,
where it's safe, or in your own backyard?
We're primarily
an archeological operation.
Weapons Research is in
its own separate facility.
It has nothing to do
with Dr. Carmack's work.
How many inside when the lab shut down?
Only Dr. Carmack's team.
That's six people.
In one of the carbon dating labs,
there was an internal phone...
left off the hook.
Did you get any information from it?
<font color="#FFFF80">[recorded screams playback]</font>
Open the door.
Portman, Goat,

Magnesium, chromium, lead.
It's all normal.

- What the hell is that?
- You never did time, Portman?
What?
- This is a holding cell.
- <font color="#FFFF80">(doubtful)</font> Bullshit.
What makes you think that?
Touch it.
- 'Cause the walls are electrified.
- <font color="#FFFF80">(peeved)</font> You asshole!
<font color="#FFFF80">[Duke]</font> Jeez. They leave shit
like this lying around?
<font color="#FFFF80">[Duke]</font>
I'd hate to see what they lock up.

<font color="#FFFF80">[Duke]</font> Hey, Sarge,
what's the deal with the sister?
Reaper's parents led the first team
of archeologists to Olduvai.
They died in some accident
when he was a kid.
She followed in their footsteps,
and he didn't.
No, what I meant was,
is she single?

Oh, yeah,
meet Lucy.
Lucy, this is my brother,
John...
another creature
from the long lost past.
- You found human remains?
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font> Humanoid.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font> Lucy and her child
were our first major find.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font>
We're bringing out more every day.
- You re-opened the dig?
- I know I should have told you.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font> I didn't figure
it was the sort of thing...
I could jot down on
a yearly birthday card.
- It's been stabilized.
- <font color="#FFFF80">(skeptical)</font> Bullshit.
You wanna talk about safe?
Like you took a desk job?
I'm a forensic archeologist, John.
I'll go where the work is.
Is that the only reason you're up here?
You wanna know why I'm up here?
I'll show you.
Come here.
This is Lucy's chromosome profile.
Notice anything?
My molecular genetics is a little rusty.
What's the first thing
Dad taught us to look for?
She's got 24 pairs of chromosomes.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font> Humans only have 23.
- But what does the extra pair do?
Makes her superhuman.
The extra pair makes her super strong...
super fit, super intelligent.
Her cells divide 50 times faster...
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font>
meaning she heals almost instantly.
The fossil record indicates these
people had conquered disease.
We found no genetic disorders,
no viruses, no cancers.
So what, they were just
naturally superior?
No.
Not naturally.
See, the earliest remains
we found only had 23.
We suspect this extra
chromosome may be synthetic.
Bioengineered?
That's a long word for a Marine.
Does it ever bother you...
you could've spent your life
looking in a microscope...
instead of a sniper scope?
If they were so smart,
how come they're so dead?
We don't know.
Maybe they just went with time.
You don't shield a baby from time.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Portman on radio]</font>
<i>We got movement up ahead.</i>
You stay here, okay?
Lock the door.
Fucking door has been ripped open.
There's something in Carmack's office.

- But he knows me, John.

go to the airlock and dig in.

will get driven straight to you.
Now let's see if we can find
the body that goes with that arm.
It's messed up, huh?
Guy like Carmack...
<font color="#FFFF80">[Portman]</font> who's trained
to put logic before emotion...
<font color="#FFFF80">[Portman]</font>
he's so freaked, huh...
he tears off his own ear?
I tell you, man.
It's shit like that,
that gets under your skin.
Do you uh...
- Do you have any?
- Do I have any?
<font color="#FFFF80">(grinning)</font> What?
You know.
I'm just a little shook up.

No, no.
- No, no, I don't do nanowalls.
- Yes, you do.
You got him?
Wait here.
Shit.
Two, three.
You okay?
- Did they find the others?
- Not yet.
My husband is with them.
I'm sure Steve's fine.
Dr. Carmack, I'm going to
take your blood pressure.
- Hey...
- It's okay, it's okay.
- I can feel it.
- What happened in there?
Shut it, shut it down.
Shut it down.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Carmack]</font>
S-shut it down.
It's inside.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font>

<i>We're re-entering.</i>
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>

<i>Some weird shit going on here, Sarge.</i>
- Can you ID him?
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font> We got a Dr. Olsen.
He rushed us. Crazy.
Just like Carmack.
- Is he dead?
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font> <i>Yeah, very.</i>
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font> <i>Should we bag him and tag him?</i>
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font> Negative.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
Continue your search.
Sarge?
- What was that?
- A monkey.
Some kind of monkey.
Oh, my God.
There's something in his blood.
What's happening to him?
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font> Move, move, move.
I got him.
Clear!
Go, go, go.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font> <i>Reaper, what have you got?</i>
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font> <i>We're chasing something.</i>
- What do you mean, something?
- Something big, not human.
God damn it!
Give me a confirmation
on what you're seeing.
- Reaper.
- It's in the sewer.
All units, all units.

And I thought
"being in the shit"
was a figure of speech.
Get in the goddamn hole, Portman.
I can handle things here.
You should go.
- I want to stay.
- Steve is gonna be okay.
The guys looking for him are the best.
Go on, go on.
Be with your daughter.
Thank you.

<font color="#FFFF80">[Duke]</font> "No blood match."

- Goat, straight ahead.
- Sir.

John, take The Kid
and go to the right.
Shit!
You lost your folks, right?
Shut up.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Kid]</font> Small world.
I mean, I lost my parents, too.
Yeah, I mean,
I woke up one morning...
and everything was gone.
I mean, the only thing left was me.
They wanted the TV
more than they wanted me.
Ah!
Every time you open your mouth...
you give away our position.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font>
Wait a minute.
Your pupils are dilated.
- Are you high?
- What?
- No, I got this condition...
- I don't give a damn.
You take one more shot of that shit...
and I'll blow holes in you.
Are we clear?
Okay.
Get down.
I'm sorry, look,
I just needed a little...
Get down!

What do you mean, he disappeared?
He's gone.
He disappeared.
I've lost the pulse.
Shit.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font>
Okay.
Gonna defib.
Clear!
Come on.
Come on.
No response.
We're losing him.
Sam, give me that adrenaline.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font> Okay, going again.
Clear!
He's gone.
Doctor, you are going to tell me...
just what the fuck is going on up here.
- What?
- Come here.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge calling]</font>
Come here!
This is "what."
<font color="#FFFF80">(astonished)</font>
God.
Have you found anything like this...
on your archeological digs?
No.
Is there any way this thing
came from the outside...
from the surface?
The planet is completely dead.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Portman]</font>
It came from somewhere, lady.
Portman, shut up!
The atmosphere on the surface
can't support life.
Maybe it doesn't need air.
It could have come from
another planet or something.
What?
Like an alien?
- <font color="#FFFF80">(shouting)</font> Look at that thing!
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge yelling]</font> Portman!
You need to shut the fuck up!
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font>
That's not what we saw.
That isn't what Goat and I
shot at in Genetics.
You telling me there's more
of these fucking things?
Where are your surface entry points?
There's a pressure door at
the end of the north corridor.
Destroyer, you, Kid, and Portman,
get there on the double.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
Give me an update.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Destroyer]</font> Yes, sir.
- Whatever this thing is...
it cannot get back through the Ark.
Mac, I want you to arm
Pinky with a weapon...
with some ST grenades,
and seal the Ark door.
There's one other door.
Where?
The entrance to the archeological dig.
<i>Ark portal activation in progress.</i>
<font color="#FFFF80">[Mac]</font>
Don't let anything through the Ark.
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.
You can't leave me here.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Pinky]</font>
I'm not a soldier.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Pinky]</font>
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
<font color="#FFFF80">[Pinky]</font>
It's bullshit.
You're supposed to protect me.
Ark secure.
<font color="#FFFF80">[synth voice]</font> <i>Remaining personnel,
ready for evacuation.</i>
Shit.
Duke.
Hold this open.
Don't be a wuss.
Little tension between you and Reaper?
We just went our separate ways.
Why does a talented student
throw it all away and join the RRTS?
So, what was he like before?
- Who, John?
- Yeah.
Empathetic, sensitive.
It's kind of hard for me to
imagine Reaper as sensitive.
I knew Reaper before all the
"drop down and give me 50, woo-ha" stuff.
Yeah?
Well, it's hua...
Hua.
Yeah.
Do you have a family?
I have Destroyer.
You know, we grew up together.
You know, Duke,
I bet secretly you have a big heart.
Oh, yeah?
And that's not the only
secret big thing I got.
Little rusty, huh?
Oh, lady, you have no idea.
Right now, having sex with me
is practically your civic duty.
I need a power bone saw.
A power bone saw?
Girl, I've been waiting
on you my whole life.
There's one in the procedure room.
Down the corridor, on the left,
through the nanowall.
Through the nanowall?
All right, I got it.
It's cool.
For you I got it,
'cause you're pretty.
Cool.
I wouldn't do it for a dude, you know.
Off you go.
We're going back in through the airlock.
We're not calling in backup?
The Ark is sealed.
Nothing gets back...
until everything on this planet is dead.
We're going in hot.
You're serious.
Pick up your weapon, Portman.
Come on, Portman, move out.
Didn't y'all see
how that thing greased Goat?
We don't know what
we're dealing with here.
It's SOP to call in reinforcements...
when a situation...
We are...
the reinforcements.
Now, you shoulder...
your fucking weapon, soldier.
<i>All UAC personnel evacuated to Earth.</i>
Duke?
Duke?
Duke!
Hey, hey, hey.
It's just a power shortage.
You okay?
Here's your bone saw.
So, which of you is the oldest?
What?
Oh, me.
By two minutes.
Twins?
Shit.
Identical, right?
Sam, get back in the lab.
Shit.
Motherfucker!
Close it!
And that's why I don't do nanowalls.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font> <i>Pinky, we're entering
the archeological dig.</i>
Secure the exit.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[young Reaper]</font> <i>Sam.</i>
- <font color="#FFFF80">[young Sam]</font> <i>I'm coming.</i>
<i>I'm hungry.
Let's eat.</i>
<i>Come on.
Come on.</i>
<i>Careful now.
Not too close, John.</i>
<i>Go, go, go.</i>
<i>Slow down.</i>
<i>Go around.
Go around again.</i>
<i>No!
Mommy!</i>
Is this where it happened?
Did you find the door?
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
<i>John?</i>
Clay.
Thurman.
Look at them.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font> They weren't trying to
stop something from getting in.
Something stopped them from getting out.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
<i>Mac, stand by.</i>
<i>Destroyer, report.</i>
<font color="#FFFF80">[Destroyer]</font>
<i>We've reached the north airlock.</i>
<i>It's secure.</i>
<i>Console indicates nothing's
come in or out for 26 hours.</i>
Mac?
Mac.
Mac, Mac, you copy?
Talk to me.
Talk to me, Mac.
Shit.
Jesus Christ.
We're in pursuit.
Moving fast out of the dig.
It's getting away.
Pinky, what do you see?
It's big.
Very big.
Moving fast,
<i>back towards the lab complex.</i>
Clear.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
It's back in the lab.
Clear!
Clear.
Damn, it's fast.
All around defense, men.
Did you get it?
- Pinky.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Pinky]</font> <i>Yes, Sarge?</i>
Anything gets through that door...
use an ST grenade.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
<i>It cannot get back to Earth.</i>
He pops an ST in there,
he's gonna blow the Ark.
Reaper, Kid, pairs,
cover formation.
Sweep the corridors.
Go.
Destroyer, you and Portman stay here.
Shut the airlock.
Maintain a perimeter.
He blows the Ark,
how the hell...
are we supposed to get the fuck home?
Portman,
shut the fucking door.
Where you going?
I'm going to the armory.
I think we're gonna need something...
with a little bit more kick.
Jesus.
You see anything like it before?
Heart.
Liver.
Kidneys.
Dogs got kidneys, right?
Pigs got kidneys.
It's had its appendix removed.
It's human.
What the fuck?
Goat knew he was turning.
This thing didn't butcher Willits.
It is Willits.
What?
This is bullshit, man.
I enlisted to serve my country...
not get greased protecting
some corporation's...
goddamn science project.
I gotta take a dump.
What?
Now?
Unless you want me shitting
my pants right here.
<font color="#FFFF80">[synth voice]</font>
<i>Please provide DNA verification.</i>
<i>Welcome, Patricia Tallman.
Access granted.</i>
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
Big fucking gun.
Oh, shit.
Portman, I got floor and wall
on your gun cam.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Portman]</font>
<i>I'm taking a shit, you fucking gimp.</i>
<font color="#FFFF80">[Pinky peeved]</font> <i>Fuck you,
Portman, you piece of shit.</i>
Lost Portman on comm...
and all I've got on Destroyer is a wall.
Portman, come in.
Destroyer.
Come in.
This is Corporal Dean Portman...
with RRTS 6 Special Ops
on Olduvai, 0310 hours.
We have encountered hostile activity.
I repeat, require immediate
RRTS reinforcements.
Destroyer, Portman,
where the hell are you?
Shit.
Shit.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Portman screaming]</font>
<i>Oh, God! Jesus!</i>
Hmm.
- Pinky, you got Portman?
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Pinky]</font> <i>No.</i>
Holy shit.
He's gone.
Destroyer?
And Portman.
What the fuck happened, man?
I got him, I got him.
Destroyer, I got you, man.
What's up, man?
What the hell is this?
And whose goddamn blood
is on that window?
Goat's.
He killed himself.
What do you mean, he killed himself?
He was already dead.
It's true.
It's Goat.
He was changing into one of these
motherfuckers and he killed himself.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font>
We found two more scientists at the dig.
Thurman and a balding guy with glasses.
Dr. Clay.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font>
Did you check their necks?
Were there open wounds on their necks?
We were conducting a firefight,
not an autopsy.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
We came up here to find six scientists.
Four are known dead...
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font> ...and Dr. Willits is probably
KIA somewhere down in that sewer.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
The only one missing is Dr. Carmack.
Has Dr. Carmack showed up yet?
Oh, he's shown up all right.
Look at the left ear.
Son of a bitch.
I think this other one is
Steve Willits.
I'm going to run the DNA,
check it against his med records.
What are you people
working on up here?
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font>
We're analyzing bones, artifacts.
We're not doing anything like this.
Then what the fuck is that?
It must be a genetic mutation,
something environmental or viral.
I don't know.
It may even be reversible.
It's irreversible.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font>
Not necessarily.
Dr. Carmack's condition...
is irreversible...
No!
Because Carmack's condition is that...
he's dead.
Kid, you and Duke...
get back to the dig and you make sure
those other dead scientists...
are really dead.
I've lost...
four soldiers.
What are you people
experimenting with up here?
I'm not gonna ask you again.
I told you, it's an
archeological research center.
Do you think I'm lying to you?
Is that what you're saying?
You think I'm hiding something?
I'm telling the truth.
What were you downloading?
What were you sent to protect?
The research data.
Research into what?
<font color="#FFFF80">[Carmack]</font> <i>Subject was injected
with study agent at 00:03.</i>
<i>Vitals normal, elevated heart rate
attributable to subject anxiety.</i>
<i>C-24 successfully grafted to
subject's marker cells at 00:09.</i>
He reconstructed chromosome
mutation on a human subject.
We were never gonna do human studies.
What the hell are we looking at?
Genesis, Chapter 1.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Carmack]</font> <i>Subject moved to
protected observation area at 00:17.</i>
<i>Subject: Curtis Stahl.</i>
<i>Crime: Multiple murder.</i>
<i>Status:
Condemned to execution.</i>
Chromosome 24.
Oh, my God.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Carmack]</font> <i>49 minutes after injection,
genetic mutations...</i>
<i>began to visually manifest
on subject's extremities.</i>
This is what you're here to protect.
It doesn't make any sense.
You trusted them.
They lied to you.
They used you, Sam.
If he perfected xenogenesis...
Christ, don't you get it?
It's this place. It's hell.
It always was.
This shit ends here.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
What are you doing?
We need to destroy these discs.
That's UAC property.
Fuck UAC, we take this back,
they'll just...
We take the data back.
- Sarge, do you not see what's going on here?
- I didn't see shit.
And I ain't paid to see shit.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font> I have my orders.
And so do you.
Is this everything?
I said,
is this everything?
- I, uh, have three more to download.
- Then do it.
Sarge?
We got a problem.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Kid on radio]</font>
<i>One dead scientist is missing.</i>
Now.
You just wanna leave her here?
She's got a job to do.
Look, this is Portman's comm.
You call if you need help, okay?
You gonna be all right?
I'll be fine.
Okay.
I'll see you soon.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font> <i>Pinky,
are you there? Pinky.</i>
Sarge? Something is cutting
<i>through the Ark door.</i>
You have a visual?
<font color="#FFFF80">[Pinky]</font>
<i>Oh, I got a visual all right.</i>
Don't let it get to the Ark!
<font color="#FFFF80">[synth voice]</font>
<i>Five.</i>
- Pinky, use the grenade!
- <i>Four.</i>
- Use the goddamn grenade!
- <i>Three, two.</i>
- Throw it!
- <i>One.</i>
Pinky's gone.
That fucker ran.
Shit.
It got through.
What the hell is that?
<font color="#FFFF80">[synth voice]</font>
<i>System reboot.</i>
<i>Time required to begin
renewed operation: Five minutes.</i>
Quarantine cordon is breached.
This mission is no longer containment.
Get all the weapons and ammo you can.
We're going through.
Move!
Sam, come in.
Over.
Sam, do you read me?
Over. Come in!
She's not answering.
<font color="#FFFF80">[synth voice]</font> <i>Time required
to begin renewed operation...</i>
<i>four minutes and 45 seconds.</i>
You got three.
Sam!
Come in, Sam!
Sam!
Sam, why didn't you answer your comm?
We gotta go now!
Why did they take Goat
and not Destroyer?
Why Carmack and not Dr. Thurman?
- What?
- Lucy had the 24th chromosome...
but she wasn't a monster.
She died protecting her child,
not devouring it.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font> Why did the same chromosome
that made her superhuman...
turn Stahl into a monster?
- Let's go.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font> Just give me a minute.
- We don't have a minute.
- Then give me 10 seconds.
This is its tongue.
This is brain matter from Portman.
This is from Destroyer.
It's choosing, John.
It's choosing who to infect.
It's choosing?
How is it choosing?
There are genetic markers
for psychotic and violent behavior.
It could be a specific
neurotransmitter...
it's picking up on,
a ganglion.
Latching onto numbers
in the DNA code linked to...
Linked to what?
Wha-- uh, evil?
Ten percent of the human
genome is still unmapped.
Some say it's the genetic
blueprint for the soul.
Maybe C-24 is what
destroyed the population.
It would explain why some of them
had to build the Ark...
to escape to a new beginning.
Some it made superhuman.
Others, monsters.
Oh, my God.
- We gotta get out of here now.
- What?
Come on, let's go.
Come on!
The people quarantined on
the other side of the Ark...
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font>
they won't all be infected!
What's going on?
Sarge is going to kill them all.
Come on!
We uphold quarantine.
Nothing gets to the elevator back on Earth.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
We can't let them get to the surface.
- If it breathes, kill it.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[synth voice]</font> <i>Five...</i>

<i>We have encountered hostile activity.</i>
<i>Require immediate RRTS reinforcements.</i>
Yeah, no shit.
We got 58 minutes before
the auto lockdown is lifted.
Reset it for another six hours.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Duke]</font> I can't.
It's been disabled.
Same as the topside comm link.
They're disabling computers now?
Yeah, they're rocket scientists,
remember?
<font color="#FFFF80">[synth voice]</font>
<i>Ark travel complete.</i>
Oh, my God.
Sarge, what's your position?
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper on radio]</font>
<i>Sarge.</i>
Sarge, come in.
Do you copy?
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font> <i>Come in, Sarge.
Do you read me? Over.</i>
<i>Sarge, come in,
do you copy?</i>
Loud and clear.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font>
<i>Look, do not kill everybody.</i>
<i>I repeat,
do not kill everybody.</i>
- Help me.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font> <i>They're not all infected.</i>
- Help me, help me, please.
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font> <i>Do you copy?</i>
- Copy that.
- Help me.
Clear the rest of this sector
and meet back at the Ark chamber.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Pinky]</font>
Jesus Christ, what the hell are...
Who the hell's in there?
Well, don't just stand there,
you dumb son of a bitch. Help me up.
It's okay.
Please...
<font color="#FFFF80">[Jenna]</font>
...help us.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font>
You don't have to kill all of them.
I don't think everyone is infected,
or even capable of being infected.
We have orders to contain this threat
by any means necessary.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font>
So let's evacuate the uninfected...
and blow this place to hell.
And we have orders
to protect this facility.
We don't have orders
to kill innocent people.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font> We have to stop anything
from getting to the surface...
by any means...
necessary.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Duke]</font> Found this little chicken shit
hiding under a pile of dead bodies.
Am I glad to see you guys.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Pinky]</font>
That thing cut right through the door.
I tried to use the grenade
but it came at me too fast.
Followed me through the Ark
and started to kill everybody.
It was horrible.
There's no wound on his neck.
He's clean.
I say who's clean...
and who's not.
I mean, it wasn't my fault.
Hey, I'm not a soldier.
You shouldn't have left me...
<font color="#FFFF80">[Kid]</font>
Sarge.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Kid]</font>
There's a storeroom to the south.
It's got, like, 20 people
holed up inside of it.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Kid]</font>
We gotta do something.
Your orders were to clear that sector.
Is it cleared?
No, I told them to stay put.
They're okay.
They're just scared shitless.
We kill them all.
Let God sort them out.
This is wrong.
- I think...
- Son, you don't think.
That's an order.
We're in the field, soldier.
Sarge, if nothing's found them...
You will
obey the direct order...
of your commanding officer.
No.
Now.
Go to hell.
<font color="#FFFF80">(yelling)</font> No!
- <font color="#FFFF80">(screaming)</font> No.
- Holy shit.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
Mutinous insurrection...
is punishable...
by death.
- It was his first mission!
- And it's not gonna be my last.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sarge]</font>
I need soldiers.
I don't need anybody else
but soldiers.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Pinky]</font>
Drop the weapons!
I mean it.
I have no intention of being killed
by a madman. Drop the weapons.
Ah, there's something behind me,
isn't there?
On me.
Get Sam.
Wait here.
Listen.
Withdraw!
Withdraw behind the nanowall.
- Move!
- <font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font> I can't see. I can't see.
Move.
Clear!
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font> Fuck!
The wall's not closing!
I'm not supposed to die.
Let's go!
Come on.
Clear.
How long before they get through?
Not long.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font>
You've been hit.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Sam]</font>
Oh, John.
Listen to me, Sam.
You're cold.
Shivering.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font>
It's important.
This is an ST grenade.
When they come through...
you pop the top and hit the button.
John, stay with me.
Stay awake.
John, stay with me,
please.
What's that?
- It's C-24. It's from Carmack's lab.
- <font color="#FFFF80">(panting)</font> No.
- It could save you.
- No way, forget it.
You're bleeding to death.
No way, Sam.
I've done some bad things.
I know you.
You don't know me.
You don't know.
You're my brother.
I know you.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font>
Wait.
Wait.
<font color="#FFFF80">[Reaper]</font> If I should turn
into one of those demons.

don't you hesitate.

- <font color="#FFFF80">(whispering)</font> I'm not sure.
Try.
Where are the survivors Kid found?
I took care of that problem.
Quarantine's almost over.
Power should be back on any minute.
- You killed The Kid.
- We're all killers, Reaper.
It's what they pay us for.
<font color="#FFFF80">[synth voice]</font> <i>Quarantine complete.
Elevators back on line.</i>
It's finished.
What do you say we go outside
and get some fresh air?
- Are you gonna shoot me?
- Yeah, I was thinking about it.
- What you got left?
- Half a clip. You?
I've got,
one round.
