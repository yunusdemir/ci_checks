Hey, get out of the car, kid.
Get out of the car.
Hey, kid. Get out of the car. Come on.
Hey, moron.
Get him out of the car, would you?
Come on, dude. Get out of the car.
Come on. Open it.
Come on. Get out of the car.
Get out of the fucking car.
Fuck!
Put down the fucking window! I'm serious!
Why'd you have to sell the car?
It couldn't stay out
in front of the house forever, T.J.
Why not?
It's not healthy.
Neither are these.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Hey.
Morning.
Can I have some money
so I can buy lunch today?
Yeah. Sorry.
Thanks.
Have a nice day, Teej.
Come on. Get up.
Please.
You just fucked me.
Who's in there?
Motherfuck!
Hey!
Cole.
Dimino.
Hooper.
Fullwood.
Edgerdon.
Fletcher.
Forney. T.J. Forney's back?
Welcome back, T.J.
Roger.
Sumner.
Sarasota...
What's up now, punk?
You don't look so tough, now, do you?
- Leave me alone.
- How about you suck my cock?
Suck my cock.
Fucking suck my cock.
Hi, pumpkin.
- Hi.
- How was your day?
It pretty much sucked.
Why, sweetheart?
I don't know. Just did.
You want me to turn on the light for you?
Why, do I look like I'm sitting
in the dark here?
I don't know. Maybe a little.
Maybe I need new glasses.
Actually, I don't even know
if these are mine.
Whose are they?
Geez, I don't know.
Well, can you see better with them?
Just... I don't know.
Is your dad up yet?
Why, has he been sleeping all day?
You know, sometimes people get thrown
off balance when bad things happen.
But they come good again, in the end.
Milk to wet your whistle?
Yeah.
Okay.
How does that feel?
Here. You want to turn
your wrist for me a little bit, like this.
And now, like this.
Good.
If we consider that dreams
serve a metaphoric function
in narrative fiction, as they do in life,
what metaphoric function are these
dreams serving for our protagonist?
Are they premonitions, or are they desires?
Are they nightmares, even?
Given what we know about Maurice,
where he's from,
what his childhood was like...
I think it's a safe assumption to assume
the dreams he's having are a reflection
upon his relationship to his mother.
T.J.! What are you doing?
Bring that here.
Hey, fuckface!
You think this is funny?
Fuckface!
You think this is funny?
I'm going to fucking rip your head off!
I'm going to fucking kill you!
You think you can draw on my fucking car?
Hey!
- Get off him!
- Get the fuck up, bitch!
Stop it!
Get the fuck up, bitch!
- I said stop it!
- Get the fuck up!
What the fuck are you doing, lady?
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hey. Hey.
We're not finished, you little piece of shit.
You okay?
Am I bleeding?
I don't think so.
Am I?
Oh.
Need a ride?
Come on. Come on.
I can't believe he called me lady.
Do I look like a lady to you?
I guess.
Thanks.
I was asking if I look old.
So...
Guess I'm kind of a hero now, huh?
Well, actually, I basically just
didn't want to have to go home
and then feel bad the rest of the day
for not helping you,
then hear about you on the news
getting beat to death in the parking lot.
So I really just did it for myself
'cause I'm selfish.
Sorry.
Sorry I'm like that.
Okay.
See you.
Hey!
You want your bike?
Shit.
Nice meeting you.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Grandma, where's Dad?
Oh, hi, T.J.
He's gone to the doctor, honey.
Everything okay?
Yeah, okay.
Where's the laundry room?
My dad's going to be home soon...
Where's the laundry room?
Why?
Ever been skull-fucked?
No.
Would you like to be?
It's through there.
But why? You can't.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Why are you here?
You're going to start acting like
I belong here, or I'll kill you.
I'll kill your family.
You can't smoke in here.
What are you doing?
You can't smoke in here.
Will you please just put it out?
How about I put it out in your mouth?
T.J., who is this?
My name's Hesher.
I'm a friend of your son's.
What is he doing here?
He's... He's doing laundry.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Is he smoking in the house?
Oh, well, I...
He's a friend of yours?
I told him he could sleep on the couch.
You guys know you only got four channels?
Hello, there, young man.
Hey, old lady.
Can I help you with something?
No, I'm good.
Fuck!
God damn it!
Jesus fucking Christ.
Now you got more channels.
So, why are you here?
What?
That your room?
No, that's the garage.
Would your friend like to eat
some dinner, dear?
He's not hungry.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
What's he doing in the garage?
I don't know.
I told him he could practice
his guitar in there.
Oh, that's great, honey.
So nice to have a bit of music
around the house again.
Is he a new friend?
Yeah. Sort of.
You know, your grandfather
played the harmonica for many years.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. We're out of milk.
I can cook you up some eggs
if you like, dear.
No, thanks.
Would you like to take a walk?
I can't, Grandma. I got stuff I got to do.
No, I mean later. This afternoon.
I don't know.
Can you ask me when I get home?
All righty.
I want to get the car back.
The car is not for sale.
Well, I want to buy it back.
So how much do you want for it?
Sit down.
$1,800 for the car,
not including taxes, registration,
- ADM or dealer fees...
- Yeah, I can get that.
On top of that, you also need
a valid driver's license.
I'm sure you don't have one of those.
- You need proof of insurance.
- But I can get...
And I know you don't have that.
And even if you did have
both of these things,
I couldn't sell you the car because
the damn thing's not for sale. End of story.
Now, if you'll let me get back to this.
Hi.
Hey.
How's it going?
I got you an ice cream.
That's so nice. Thank you.
And I paid for it over there.
Thank you.
See you.
See you.
And earlier that day,
I had made a cherry cake.
And I used... I didn't know until afterwards,
I used a new product. It was called Fluffo.
I never made it again, that Fluffo.
I served the cake, and then...
It stuck to the roof of their mouth.
They couldn't swallow it!
Fucking Fluffo.
Oh, hi, T.J.
Hi, honey.
So, who's going for a walk with me
tomorrow morning?
T.J.?
I can't, Grandma.
I have to go to school tomorrow.
Oh. Okay. Okay.
You're always invited.
So what?
So what, school?
Go on a walk with your grandma.
He's right, T.J.
I'd love the company.
Fucking A, she would.
Your grandma goes walking
in the morning by herself.
You can't get your ass
out of bed an hour earlier?
What if she gets raped?
What?
Ever heard of the Granny Killer?
- The Granny Killer?
- Yeah, the Granny...
The Granny Killer killed, like,
13 or 14 old ladies.
Used to choke them
with their dirty panties and shit.
I don't think he'd cock-fuck 'em all,
- but he would finger-fuck 'em all.
- Okay. That's enough.
I don't care. I'm just saying.
Your grandma asked you to go for a walk.
You should go.
So she doesn't get raped.
Why would anyone rape me?
Fucked if I know.
People do it.
There's some sick fucks out there.
You fucked my car, you little prick.
Get in there. Eat the cake!
Fucking eat the fucking cake!
Get off me!
Get off me!
Get off!
Eat the cake, you bitch!
Ready?
I don't want to go.
It will be good for us.
Come on. Teej, we're going to be late.
So, welcome everyone
to the transformational grief group.
My name is Meryl.
We should start off by introducing ourselves
and briefly explaining why we are here.
Hi. Would you please start us off?
We're the Bolder Family.
I'm Coleen. This is my husband Jack.
Our daughter Cynthia...
Was murdered last year.
She's the victim
of a violent attack that was unfair and sick.
We're here 'cause we need help.
We lost our baby.
Hi. My name is Jack.
As my wife said, we're here hoping
for some answers, and...
Just some help with the pain.
Thank you.
Coleen and Jack, welcome.
Sir?
Sure, okay.
My name is Paul Forney,
and this is my son T.J.
And we're here because I lost my wife,
T.J.'s mom,
a bit more than two months ago.
We're just
trying to come to terms with things.
And looking
for guidance around...
...things. So, yeah.
Okay. Welcome, Paul.
Hi, T.J.
I understand how hard it is to lose a mom.
Would you like to introduce yourself,
say a few words to the group?
What the fuck's your problem?
What the fuck's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
You let that fucking asshole
stick my head in the toilet.
You just stand there and watch him do it.
Get out.
Get out of my grandma's house!
Get out.
Get the fuck off me.
I'm going to put some clothes on.
You meet me outside in my van, all right?
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
What are we doing here?
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
What are you doing?
What are we doing here?
What are you doing?
Let's get out of here.
Shit.
Come on, man. Let's just get out of here.
Please. What are you doing?
What is that? What...
Stop.
Stop. You can't do...
You got gas on my head.
Come on. Let's go.
Stop.
Just go home.
Shit. No. No, no, no.
This isn't funny. Come on.
Come on. Just go.
Come on, man. Just get out of here.
Please, no. Stop.
No, no, no.
What the hell's your problem!
Come on! Let's go, quick!
Come on! Let's go! Hurry up!
Come on!
Shit. The car's locked. Open it up!
Open the door. It's locked.
Open the door!
Open the door!
Shit!
What the fuck?
Hey! Hey!
Get in the van.
No.
Get in the fucking van, now.
I'm going to run you over.
Dude?
Dude, that was fucking awesome.
You flew, like, fucking five feet.
Oh!
Okay.
Let's go.
Fuck.
Come on.
Hello, ma'am. I'm Officer Haywood.
This is Officer Jordan.
We need to speak to Thomas Forney.
- Tommy?
- Thomas Forney.
Is he here?
Are you Thomas Forney?
Yeah.
We'd like to ask you some questions.
It's just some questions, dude.
What about?
Can you get dressed, please?
Let this be a warning to you.
Regardless of what evidence
we find or don't,
you've come to our attention today.
Turn left.
Our attention's not good.
These are felony offenses.
Serious jail time offenses.
Did you do it?
Not really.
Not really?
I didn't do it.
You just said not really.
What does that mean, "not really"?
I said I didn't do it, okay?
Okay. Before that, I asked you if you did it,
and you said "not really."
I can't remember what I said.
Why would you do something like that?
Want a peanut?
No.
So, what'd the pigs want?
What the fuck do you think?
I don't know.
They give you a cavity search?
Just fuck off, okay?
What? What'd they do?
They took my fucking fingerprints.
Yeah, so?
Just leave me alone.
All right, I'll go. But on one condition.
Do you think she shaves her pussy?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here, dude?
You're not shopping.
You're stalking that chick.
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.
I've been following you.
You going to try and fuck her?
- No.
- Well, that's good.
You can't fuck her from here, dude.
Got to be way closer.
What?
Hey, you want to poke her?
Shut up.
Dude, there's nothing wrong
with wanting to poke her.
Stop saying that.
Dude, if you want to poke her, there's
nothing wrong with that. Don't be ashamed.
Human beings have been poking vagina
for hundreds of years.
Longer, probably.
Bro.
Seriously, there's nothing
wrong with wanting some pussy.
Where you going?
Home.
I'll give you a ride.
No, thanks.
Well, all right.
But if you go with me,
it will take you five minutes.
Ride the bike, it's like, what, 15?
Fine.
But don't talk to me, okay?
I won't say shit.
Listen, man.
I'm sorry about the fire the other night.
That was...
That was totally out of control, and...
It was foolish and irresponsible, really.
So, I'm sorry.
But, here.
I want you to have this.
Get that away from me.
Dude, are you gay? I don't...
Well, I can't work you out.
Oh, shit.
What are you doing?
Stop the car. I want to get out.
Stop the car...
Get out of this van, and I will rip
your dick off and fuck her for you.
Whoops.
That's fucked up.
Sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know...
Just messed up the back
of my car, you stupid idiot.
Oh, my God.
You're a fucking idiot.
Lady, you're an absolute idiot.
What is the matter with you?
I don't know what happened, sir.
You need to pay attention
when you are driving a fucking car.
Yeah, I think I can be of some help here.
I saw the whole thing.
She was just sitting there.
You backed right into her.
I what?
I don't know what's wrong with you, man.
Why would you back into a car?
It's fucking retarded.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You should probably start talking
about paying for her damages.
- Look at this shit.
- I did not back into her.
Calling me a fucking liar?
Look, I don't... What is going on here?
I don't know.
Sounds like you're calling me a fucking liar.
No...
Okay. All right. All right.
I don't want any trouble here.
- You don't want any trouble?
- No.
I think you do, Miss Piggy.
This is ridiculous.
Come on, dude. Let's just get out of here.
Dude, your sexy girlfriend's in trouble.
We're not going anywhere.
You guys know each other?
Hi.
Sometimes, you know, a day is bad,
and you think it couldn't get any worse,
and then, suddenly you discover
whole new ways it can get worse.
No, thanks.
Get that away from me.
This one time, a couple of years back,
I had these four chicks
in the back of the van,
and we're all, like, super fucking wasted
and going for it, right?
So I was eating this one chick out,
I was fingering another chick,
but there's still two chicks, right,
and they want to get off.
So I got my other hand
fingering this other chick,
and I got my toe rubbing on
the fourth chick's asshole
and I was going crazy, man.
It was like, "This is too much."
You know, I was like,
couldn't tell which chick was which.
Tongue started to hurt.
Fingers getting tired.
I stepped back.
You know what happened?
These chicks just start
working on each other.
They're fingering each other,
eating each other out.
I just sat back and watched the whole thing.
I just whipped my cock out,
jerked myself off.
Everyone's a winner.
Was that some kind of
perverted metaphor for me?
A what?
Never mind.
Whoa! Stop!
I mean it! What are you doing?
You're going to kill us!
Please, stop! Are you fucking crazy?
The fuck was that?
I saw a mouse.
What? You okay?
I think I have dirt in my mouth.
Yeah.
So, what are we doing?
All right.
We're here.
We're where?
Come on.
Where are we?
What's that?
Whose house is this?
Yeah. No, I don't really like anything.
Excuse me.
I'm talking to you.
Whose house is this?
- This house?
- Yeah.
My uncle's house.
Well, where is your uncle?
- Right over there.
- Where?
Oh!
What the fuck?
Well, you were dirty.
Yeah, now I'm wet.
Oh, you're dirty and wet? I'm coming in.
Now I'm dirty and wet, too.
R-2!
R-2! Shut down
all the fucking trash compactors!
All the...
R-2!
R-2!
All the fucking...
Trash compactors on the detention level.
Oh, shit! There's more trash coming in!
Motherfuck!
Motherfuck!
How do you know this guy?
I don't know. He's sort of moved in
my grandma's house with us.
What, you mean he's, like,
renting a room or something?
No, not really.
It's kind of a long story.
Fish!
Fresh fish!
Fire.
Fuck you, bitches!
Jump in the fire.
I got a doctor's appointment.
What?
It burns when I urinate.
Did he just leave us here?
I think so.
I think we should get out of here.
Let's go.
So what's his name?
Hesher.
Hesher? Is that a name?
I don't know.
Does he have a last name?
I don't know.
My shoes are so squishy.
How old is he?
I don't know.
Do you know anything about him?
No, not really.
Man, that was lucky you were behind me
when that guy got all mad about his car.
I was freaking out.
I don't have insurance right now
because I can't really afford it.
And there's no way
I could afford to fix his car.
How do people do this stuff?
I mean, I have a job.
It's kind of a joke. I mean,
I've been there almost a year,
and I still have only, like, 15 hours a week.
Why don't they give me more hours?
Do you think it's 'cause they think I suck?
Did you think I sucked
when I served you at the checkout?
No.
I mean, I can't even afford
to pay my rent right now.
I'm going to have
to start selling shit pretty soon.
Here.
I...
I got two bucks.
The sad thing is,
I could actually use it right now.
- Then here. You can have it.
- No.
Oh, no.
Please tell me that's not a ticket.
Oh, no.
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck! Fuck!
Fuck. Shit.
What did I do to deserve
this chain reaction of shit all the time?
You know, I feel like if I died,
no one would even notice.
Well, I would.
If you were to die right now, I would notice.
Mainly because I'd be sitting in a car
next to a dead lady.
Please don't call me lady.
Hi, T.J.
Hi, Grandma.
So...
You fuck her?
No.
Where were you today?
Counseling. 3:30. I'm there by myself.
Sorry. I forgot.
Oh, that's real nice.
You know, it's just as much
for you as it is for me.
I waited outside the school for 45 minutes.
Yeah, well, I told you I don't want to go.
Well, maybe you could let me know
when you decide not to show next time.
- I did. I told you I didn't want to go.
- No, you didn't.
I told you, like, a thousand times.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. You're just not listening.
You didn't tell me that.
You told me you didn't want to go.
You didn't tell me you were just
going to not show up.
What difference does it make?
For me, a big difference.
Means I'm sitting in
a room full of losers by myself.
Boys, please.
I'm not feeling very well.
Please pass me my pills.
Did you finger her twat?
Shut the fuck up!
- T.J.!
- What?
Language. I mean it.
- Did you hear what he just said?
- It doesn't matter.
You talk like that again,
you're going to your room.
My room?
You're going to start punishing me now?
Yeah. Maybe I am. If it's not the language,
then it's your lack of responsibility.
Me having to escort you
to the police station.
Shit, Dad. I'm really sorry you
had your ass dragged off the couch.
And I'm sorry you had to put some fucking
underpants on for the first time in months.
- T.J.!
- What!
Hey! That's enough.
So as soon as I'm right, that's enough?
I don't want to hear another word from you.
Fine.
Fuck this!
That make you happy, huh?
Did I miss something?
Not really.
He said some dumb shit.
He smashed his plate, so he smashed his.
But I think he just did it
'cause he couldn't think of anything to say.
The kid had a point.
So he felt bad about himself.
He left. I don't know where...
I wish...
I wish there were
something more I could do.
It's delicious.
Oh. Thank you, dear.
Hey.
What's green and slimy
and smells like bacon?
I don't know, dear.
Think about it. What's green
and slimy and smells like bacon?
A worm? I don't know.
Going to lie down.
Still not feeling too well.
All right.
Hey.
You figure it out?
Figure what out, dear?
What's green and slimy
and smells like bacon?
I don't know.
Would you do me a favor, please?
Yeah.
Could you hand me that old container
on top of the cabinet?
Which one? This one?
Yeah. Thank you.
It's Kermit the Frog's finger.
You know, 'cause Miss Piggy.
What's that?
Oh, they're medical cigarettes
to help with the nausea.
Would you please light a match for me?
Yeah. Can I just see that real quick?
I'll be right back.
May I?
Thanks.
What is that?
That is a bong.
It's got water in it. It filters the smoke.
It's actually probably
the healthiest way to smoke weed.
I'll show you how to do it.
You see that hole right there?
You got to keep your finger on that.
Then, you light the bowl.
Then, when the thing
fills up with smoke like that,
you let go right here. Then you...
Here.
Here you go.
I'll light it for you. Here.
Just turn it like that.
Hang on. Put your thumb
on the hole right there.
I'll light this, and you suck. Okay? Yeah.
Go ahead and suck.
Yeah. Here you go.
Lift your thumb. Big breath. Big breath.
Yeah.
Oh, my.
Hit it again.
No. I...
I think I'm okay. Thank you.
All right. I'll just finish this off.
Honey, how old are you?
Who wants to know?
I don't know.
You seem a little older than T.J.
Who?
Oh, stop it.
Aren't you a little old
to be hanging around T.J. all the time?
Aren't you?
No. I'm his grandmother.
That's true.
You know, I...
I used to have this snake. Big fucker.
I used to have to feed him.
Once a week, I'd give him a live mouse.
Yeah.
You know, snakes. You know they're snakes
because they're the right shape.
Well, anyway, this one ate mice.
And there was this one time
I dropped a mouse in his cage,
and he got a whiff of it, so he went for him,
and this mouse
got up on his hind legs
and punched him in the face.
You're kidding.
Happened again, too.
The snake went for him again.
Hit him again.
Snake didn't know what to do.
Got a little fucked up.
Went off in the corner and cried.
And that fucking mouse ruled the cage.
Went on for weeks. He just, like,
walked around like he owned the joint.
Sitting in a little lawn chair or something,
scratching his balls, shelling peanuts.
I mean, like, defiant.
Yeah. I tried to feed him other mice, too.
But I'd drop the new mouse into the cage,
and he'd just hide behind the old mouse.
The snake's scared shitless.
He died. Starved to death.
Yeah.
Cage full of mice.
So is T.J. the mouse?
I don't know. Maybe he is.
Who the hell am I?
You?
You're an old lady.
No.
I'm a grandmother.
Yeah. You're a grandmother.
You know what?
Grandmother, I'm going to go
on that walk with you tomorrow morning.
Oh, no. That's nice.
Where are you going?
I don't know. I'm gonna go with you.
Wherever. Around the block, I guess.
Well, have...
Good time.
No, I'm going to go with you.
Well...
See you when you get back.
Why don't you send him over? Sure.
Can I talk to you?
Hold on a minute. I'm on the phone.
Can you see that?
I need to talk to you.
I'm on the... Wait outside.
Wait outside.
Did you come here
so I can break your fucking neck?
What?
I got the money.
What money?
You said if I got $1,800,
then I could have the car back.
Are you kidding?
I said even if you had $1,800,
I still couldn't sell it to you.
It's not here anymore, anyway.
What do you mean?
I feel like I've had this conversation
too many times already. But I'm telling you,
I'm not going to have it again,
because the car's gone.
- What are you talking about?
- It's not here.
It's over. It's gone.
Well, where's it gone?
Kid, it's all over. Go.
Goodbye. Go.
What's going on?
I got to get the fuck out of here
before I hurt somebody.
Hi, it's Nicole. I'm not in right now.
Leave a message, and I'll call you back.
Hi. It's T.J.
Sorry to bug you, but...
I guess I just wanted to talk to you.
I have a present for you,
so I guess I'll just...
Come by and drop it off or something, or...
Yeah. Okay. Bye.
Fuck you!
Hey! You!
The fuck do you think you're doing?
Back the fuck up!
- Fuck, man!
- Fuck you!
- Chill out.
- Shut the fuck up.
And you're a fucking whore!
Hope you die. When you do,
no one's going to fucking notice,
'cause you're just a fat, fucking prostitute.
- Dude, chill out, all right?
- Back the fuck up!
I'll smash you in the face. I swear to God.
I never want to see you
or your ugly fucking faces again!
That goes for both you fucking assholes.
Fuck you!
I fucking hate you!
Hey. I want to talk to you.
- Hey. Dude, I want to talk to you.
- Get your fucking hands off me.
Dude, calm down. Calm the...
No! Fuck! God damn it!
- I said I just want to fucking talk to you!
- Get off me!
Calm the fuck down!
Hey! Hey! Get off him! What are you doing?
- Come on!
- I'll fucking cut you!
- You...
- Fuck! No!
- T.J.! No!
- No!
Fuck both of you motherfuckers!
You okay?
T.J.?
I actually went through 15 months of school.
Went through their extensive training
in mathematics, physics, chemistry.
They train you to be the best
and expect you to be the best.
It probably would have cost me around...
- Where's my car?
- What the fuck!
- Where's the fucking car?
- Are you crazy?
Make me ask one more time,
your fucking toe's coming off. Where is it?
It's gone to the wrecker's!
Fuck!
It's gone to the fucking wrecking yard, fool!
That's fucking bullshit.
Why would I be lying?
Because you're a fucking asshole!
Now, tell me where it is!
It's gone to the fucking wrecking yard!
I swear to God. Ah, fuck!
Fuck!
If you're lying, I'm going to cut off
every one of your fucking toes.
You understand me?
Yeah.
Anything else you want to fucking tell me?
You want to come in my house?
- Get the fuck off me!
- What, bitch?
Fuck!
Fuck! My nose!
What the hell are you doing?
- My nose!
- What?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I just saved you.
I told you I never want
to fucking see you again!
How many times do I need to tell you?
Just leave me alone!
Come on, honey.
Come on, sweetheart.
What the hell is in this thing?
Come on, guys. We got to go.
We're going to be late.
What about the pizza?
You can eat it in the car.
Cool.
Honey, what is in here?
You know what?
Let's take my car. You drive.
Can you get the door?
Sure.
I think we should keep the new one
and give them our old one.
That's a great idea.
I'll be sure to let them know that our
old, dirty microwave was a gift from you.
Good.
They don't even know who I am, anyway.
Honey, they're my friends.
I know.
I just don't know why we need
to give them so many presents.
A microwave and a bottle of scotch
is hardly a lot of presents.
And flowers?
- And flowers.
- And flowers.
- Mom, can you turn the radio on?
- Yeah, baby.
Help!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Get back. Get back.
Get back!
What the hell are you doing?
I don't know.
Where have you been?
Sorry.
Where have you been?
I'm sorry.
It's 10:00 in the morning.
How is this fair to me?
I don't know.
Go to your room.
Someone's at the front door for you.
Hesher's not here.
I came to see you.
I didn't know if I should come or not.
But I couldn't stop thinking about it.
I thought if I came,
you'd still be angry and hate me.
But then I thought if I didn't come, you'd
think I didn't care and you'd hate me anyway,
so I figured I might as well come.
Just in case, so...
Here I am.
Well, what do you want?
I want to apologize.
I feel bad about what happened.
It doesn't really matter.
It does matter.
It matters to me.
I really like you, T.J.
And I understand
if you don't want to be my friend,
but I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
I just...
Sometimes, I...
I don't know.
But I thought I should come over
and say that,
so you can still hate me anyway, but...
I just thought I'd come say that.
And now I said it.
Okay, bye.
Sorry I broke your lamp.
It's okay.
And I'm sorry I called you a fat prostitute.
It's okay.
You're not fat.
But I am a prostitute?
I don't know. Maybe.
We are gathered here today
to mourn the loss and commemorate the life
of Madeleine Frances Forney.
Madeleine was a beloved wife,
mother, grandmother, and friend.
And now Mrs. Rosowski,
a dear friend and neighbor,
will say a few quick words.
I did not know Madeleine long enough.
From the moment I moved
into the neighborhood,
she treated me as if I was one of the family.
She had such a kind, wonderful heart.
We shared many wonderful walks
and enjoyed each other's company
very much.
I will miss our walks
and most of all, our talks.
I will always remember what she told me.
"Life is like walking in the rain.
"You can... You can hide and take cover,
"or you can just get wet."
Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Rosowski.
T.J.?
I think you should say something.
Come on, T.J.
Sorry.
Okay, so now at this point,
we should conclude the service with...
Yeah, I just want to add something
to what the kid said
'cause I think I know
where he was going with that.
What are you doing? Come on.
Sir, we have to go...
Don't fucking touch me.
Back up. Sit down.
I know you don't want me here,
I don't even want to be here, all right?
I didn't come here for me.
I fucking came here for her.
Now, she's been trying
to tell you guys something,
but you're too fucked up to listen,
so if you'll just shut up for a second,
I'm gonna say what I want to say.
Then you'll never see me again.
I pulled this gas tank from an old Chevy.
I wanted to blow it up, so I did.
What I didn't think about was all the,
you know, little bits of metal
that were gonna fly in every direction.
And I almost killed myself.
I woke up in this hospital.
And this doctor was like, "Son."
And I said, "Don't call me son,
you fucking cunt."
And then, he was, like,
"You blew off your nut."
I just lost my nut like that.
I went fucking crazy.
I assaulted a nurse
or a doctor, I don't remember,
but I got arrested, I went to juvie.
All I could think about
was my fucking nut, man.
I'm missing a nut.
What am I gonna do?
I had to go looking for it, right?
So I busted out of juvie and I went
searching, couldn't find my nut.
Well, there was this one night,
I was sitting there and I was taking a shit,
I was looking at my balls and staring
at this little piece of flabby sack
where my left nut used to be.
And then, I saw my right nut
for the first time.
I was like, "Fuck, man! My nut!
"Look, I have... I still have a nut."
Right?
It's a good nut. It works.
God or the fucking devil
or whoever the fuck it is,
you know, he left me with one good nut.
I still have a fucking nut and it works,
and my fucking dick works, too.
Okay, you lost your wife.
And you lost your mom.
I lost my nut.
Fuck this.
Hey, hey! Don't fucking touch that!
Get your fucking hands
off the box! Go! Move!
Go!
I told Grandma that I was gonna
go on a walk with her.
That's what I'm gonna do.
You told Grandma
you were gonna go on a walk with her.
This is your last chance.
Good morning, Teej.
Whoa.
I know. It's weird, right?
I can feel the air on my face again.
It looks good.
Thanks.
Hesher's gone.
What do you mean?
I think you should come see this.
