I'm Frances.
It's Skip. Nice to meet you.
You too, and... Bye, bye.
We should officially do business.
I buy the houses
and you design and renovate
and we turn a tidy profit!
I hate to say it, but I do like you.
You loaned me money, which I appreciate,
but we're not actually partners.
That prick from the auction, he's here.
Can I take you out for dinner sometime?
I would feel impolite accepting
when I'm here with someone else.
It's too soon for me
to be getting involved.
Yeah, I think my exact words were
you were a walking disaster.
And my instincts were right.
Skip Zakarian wants to rep me.
This means that we won't
be working together.
You weren't even finishing
your paintings when I met you!
Thanks for everything. I'm done here.
- Hi!
- Hey.
Did you study for your math final?
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, you're so good.
Yeah, he got out the old abacus
and kicked some butt.
Mom, wait till you hear about summer.
What about... what about summer?
- Um...
- Thank you.
You know, we, uh... maybe hoping to...
take the kids to Italy.
- We... you and Jackie?
- Yeah.
With your permission, of course.
She's got an old college roommate
that made a shitload of money
selling hair extensions
and bought a villa... in Italy.
And even has a... (CHUCKLES)
big fucking moat.
And she's offered it to us for free,
um, you know, for June.
And July.
- For June and... and July?
- Yeah.
Well, I don't want to
be without the kids
for all of June and July.
I mean, summer's the only
time I have with them
when they're not just...
cranky all the time
from too little sleep.
You know.
Yeah, but they've never been to Europe.
Well, I'm well aware of that.
As you know, it has been my dream
to take them, and as you also well know,
we haven't been able to afford that.
(GROANS) I'm sorry, but it's a no.
And you should've told me
before you spoke to them
because now... shit, now I'm in
this, like, lousy position.
Once again, I'm the dream killer.
Well, if the<i> scarpe</i> fits.
- That's "shoe" in Italian.
- Yes, it's... yes, I know.
- We were studying last night.
- Really? Already?
No worries. You know, we'll... okay.
- <i>Ciao,</i> which is "good-bye" and "hello."
- Yeah,<i> ciao,</i> as in Italian.
- I know.
- <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>So,</i> ciao.

What the fuck?
Ugh, this is bullshit!
I wish it were.
Where's the part about you finding her
and us launching her career, huh?
- Where's that?
- Oh, nowhere.
Nowhere. I am officially scrubbed
from her entire history.
I never trusted that Sylvia, but Skip?
I went to St. Barts with Skip.
He was, like, my pal.
Well, your pal is taking
every ounce of credit for Sylvia.
Yeah, and all our future profits.
<i>I'm like training wheels.</i>
I get them started,
I give them a little shove,
and then they ride off
on their brand-new two-wheelers
into the sunset without me.
Oh, and get this... Robert and Jackie
want to take the kids
to Europe this summer.
- That's great.
- No, it's not great, Diane, it's not.
I don't want to spend the whole
summer alone without them.
Oh, my God, please.
If I had kids, all I'd want
was a long break from them.
(CHUCKLES) Well, then it's probably good
you never had them.
Yeah. You know what, Frances?
Maybe Sylvia and Robert were like
training wheels for you, you know?
<i>It's like when I was working</i>
at the glove counter at Saks
and living in that tiny
studio in the East 50s.
I just loved my life.
And then I met Nick
and my life got even bigger and better!
So you just don't know, Frances.
You don't know what the future holds.
(GROANS) Apparently, it
holds a lot of blank walls.
I'm just gonna be glad to get
these Sylvias out of here
and to their new owners.
Who's that?
Oh, some kid up the road did it.
I didn't have the heart to tell him
that it looked like
one of those elephants
holding a paintbrush made it.
Diane.
You know what? I like it.
It's bright, it's happy,
I don't love it.
Can't hurt me. I'm borrowing it.
Please, thank God.
Motherfucker!
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly.
Frances. It's good to see you.
Really? Is it good to see me?
'Cause I have some things
to say to you, asshole.
Well, okay, you're...
you're coming in hot.
Maybe poaching Sylvia was some sort
of pathetic dick swing payback
for my declining your dinner invitation.
- It wasn't.
- Okay, well, regardless,
it was a full-on shady thing to do.
So, I'm gonna... gonna give you
a little background...
a little history, okay?
When I met Sylvia, she was
in a total artistic coma.
I worked with her and I
sure as hell didn't do it
so that you could show up in your fancy
car service one night and steal her.
I mean, is that what you do?
Pretty much, yes.
- Wow, how... how do you sleep at night?
- Look, I don't have the eye
or, frankly, the energy
to do what you do.
I wish I did.
But once an artist is on my radar,
I can sell the shit out of them.
I know what people want,
I know how much money these people have,
and I know where
they've parked their yachts.
So, the way I see it, you can go on
having people like me steal your artists
or we could discuss working together.
Are you serious?
You fuck me over and then you expect me
to go into business with you?
Oh, that's rich.
Hey, you can stay in your
sleepy little hamlet
and watch people leave you
or you can move forward.
That's my two cents.
Unbelievable.
(CHUCKLES) Oh, and, uh, here.
You can keep your two cents
and your pricey trinket.
I'm not for sale.
Call me if you want to talk.
Jesus.
So, all profits on future investments
are split 50-50.
- Yep.
- All righty, if you both sign
at the bottom, your real estate
partnership is finalized.
Check that out. What a signature.
You should've seen it in high school.
It actually included a smiley face.
Aw.
- Well, congratulations...
- That's sweet.
you are now a corporation.
And if I could just say,
- you two are adorable.
- Oh.
- You're pretty cute yourself, Michelle.
- Well, thank you.
(LAUGHS) And you work well together.
These agreements are difficult,
believe you me.
Basically, it's like doing a prenup,
but you guys just breezed on through.
- Oh, butterscotch?
- Oh, thank you.
(WHISPERS) Shit.
Come on.
Oh, my...
Oh! Oh, my God.
Holy shit.
Thanks for coming.
I didn't know who else to call.
Plumbers.
This is their profession.
Just throwing it out there.
Of course. Yeah, no, it's
better to call a plumber,
but I panicked, 'cause that was,
like, shooting at me sideways.
Oh, and by the way, we have no water
pressure in the upstairs shower
and that was like a fire hose.
If that's a veiled attempt
to get me to fix
the showerhead, no way, Jos√©.
Oh, no, no, just this one job, sir.
'Cause you know this house
better than anyone.
This house and I have been
through <i>many</i> emotional highs
and lows together.
Hey, so, what, your... your fella
not available to come help?
He's not my fella.
- And we're done.
- Really? Copy that.
Seemed like a nice guy, though.
Except for, you know,
those weird sweater-vests.
He did not wear sweater-vests.
In his soul, he was
wearing a sweater-vest.
- No.
- Oh, reminds me.
I have something for you.
Here you go.
$75,000?
Finally started to make some
money on these flip houses.
And I just wanted to pay you back.
'Cause, you know, you supported me...
well, the family... for so long.
Really long time.
You trying to buy me off so you
can take the kids this summer?
Jesus. Just say thanks
and invest in a new pipe.
Thank you.
Really... thank you.
And congratulations on...
you know, the houses, on everything.
Thanks. It feels good.
It's really weird, I never imagined
when we first bought this place...
you know, that we wouldn't be...
- Yeah.
- Huh, it's weird.
I thought I would drop
dead in this house.
- You know?
- Do you ever wonder,
like... what if we met each other now?
You mean if New Frances met New Robert?
Yeah. Yeah.
- I think we'd have a lot of laughs.
- Yeah.
Mostly at the expense
of... of Old Frances.
Hi, I'm Frances.
- Swifty.
- Sw... Swifty?
New Robert gets to call
himself whatever he wants.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh.
- I'm so sorry. Oh.
- I can't do it again.
- No, of course not. It...
- I'm with Jackie.
No, I... I know that. I know that.
I'm sorry.
I don't know, Frances,
that whole Skip idea
sounds kind of tempting.
 We could team up with him
and make a killing, come on!
I don't want to make a killing!
I want to enjoy what I do.
You know, I used to enjoy art.
This whole Sylvia business has just...
has left a very bad taste in my mouth.
All right, forget about business
and we can have some fun.
Hey, you're coming to our Memorial
Day barbecue this Sunday, right?
- Yeah, I'll be there.
- Yay!
Oh, and Nick invited Robert and Jackie.
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, absolutely.
No, we're good, so, yeah,
there's no worries there...
Whoa... (STUTTERS) wait.
This reminds me. Um... here.
I want you to have this.
A check made out to you?
Well, no, I mean, Robert made it out
to me, and I endorsed it to you.
See? It's to pay you back.
- For the gallery loan.
- Oh!
I mean, I can't think of no
better recipient than you.
You've done so much for me, Diane.
- So thank you.
- You don't have to do this, Frances.
No, I... I want to do it.
I'm proud to do it.
Oh, I see. So this is how it ends.
Wait, what?
Now that the dreadful Pelts is gone,
you just don't have any more use for me.
No, Diane, please don't make this
something that it isn't, all right?
I... I have been telling you for so long
that I'm gonna pay you back and
I feel like you just chose
to not hear me.
I'm giving you money. It's a good thing.
Yeah, for you, I guess.
- Oh, come on. Diane!
- No.
You wanted to do the gallery
alone, now I want to be alone.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
Don't try and stop me.
- Okay.
- <i>You can Uber home!</i>
I... there's no service.
<i>Oh, come on. Diane!</i>
Good.
You know what would be fun
to do in Italy?
Buy leather.
(WHOOSHES) Yes!
Get married.
Wait, what?
You know, that butterscotch
candy lawyer was right.
I mean, we did the hard work.
And... and we work together.
Really well.
I know it's really fast...
but my marriage lasted a long time
and look where that ended up.
I mean, life's short, Jackie.
I don't remember what that quote was
from that inspirational, cheesy poster,
but... I want my future to start.
Today.
You're asking me to marry you.
Will you marry me?
- Fuck yeah!
- Fuck yeah.
- Say it again!
- Fuck Frances.
- Say it again!
- Fuck Frances!
I was the best goddamn
partner she ever had.
I knew her peccadilloes, her needs,
and let me tell you something, Dwayne,
this lady is<i> not</i> a walk in the park.
- Fuck her!
- Thank you, Dwayne.
And I wanna tell you something...
I really like you. You're a good person.
May I buy you a new cap?
- Okay.
- Okay.
But first, we need another round.
- Okay.
- Barkeep, can I have two more 7 and 7s?
Ma'am, you've had enough.
- Ma'am?
- Ooh.
Ma'am!
Fuck you!
You can't kick me out
because I'm<i> choosing</i> to go!
Bullshit. Fuck you, I'm out of here.
Fuck you!
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Hey, it's... (STUTTERS)
Oh, Diane, come on.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
Huh. What was that about?
I paid her back for the gallery loan,
and you'd think I killed her mother.
Oh. Well, she loathes her mother.
She'd probably welcome that.
- Well...
- Tequila, extra lime.
You're the best.
- Ted, this is Frances.
- Hi.
Oh, yes, the tennis partner.
- We finally meet.
- You don't have a drink.
- Do you like tequila?
- Yes, I do.
- Here, I insist.
- Oh.
That's very nice of you.
You're a real gentleman.
Thank you very much.
I'll be right back
with more reinforcements.
Well, well, well.
- Kissing partners.
- I know, he's a child.
He's adorable, he's delightful.
Who cares how old he is?
You deserve to have some fun.
I'm happy for you and for him.
You know who else is happy for him?
- Who?
- His ex-wife, who still lives with him.
- They're besties.
- Really?
Really. How can people in their 30s
have more complicated lives than us?
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
skedaddle to the corn dogs.
Oh, okay, all right.
I'll talk to...
I think Frances just ran away from us.
Yeah, she was a sprinter in college.
Hey, uh, have you told her yet?
What, about you and me?
No, about my fucking quiche recipe.
Robbie!
Yes, I was planning on
telling her later.
I just thought that, you know,
once we had partaken in punch
and fellowship and, uh... and fireworks.
You have to tell her today, okay?
You owe that to her.
And we can't tell the kids
until you tell her.
Oh, Jesus, it's a house of cards.
Have you told anyone?
Like, a friend?
I told my mother and I booked the camel
I'm riding in on.
One of those things is a lie.
Hello, my friends, welcome, welcome.
God bless our fallen troops
and don't miss the sangria bar.
What news do you bring
from the outside world?
Jackie and I are getting married, Nick.
- Oh, fuck!
- No kidding!
That's fantastic.
Oh, my God, that's amazing news!
We so love it when our
young people get married.
You know, Diane and I have been married
nearly 11 years now
and, her murder attempt aside, I just...
I couldn't recommend
the institution more.
Oh, that's great news.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Um, well,
but we actually were hoping
we could just keep this all between us.
- Mmm.
- Haven't really spoke
to the masses just yet,
which mainly and namely
involves Frances.
Your secret's safe with me.
Norman, how's the knee, you cocksucker?
You wanted me to tell somebody.
You have to go tell her. Right now!
Fuck.
<i>Michael, I noticed that
many of the people outside</i>
aren't eating food, so make sure
to pass the food sticks around
to the outside people, 'cause
I want them to get eaten.
Thank you, Michael.
Diane, can... can we talk
about this, please?
Mm, I have some real friends
to entertain, so excuse me.
(GROANS) Oh, my God, this is ridiculous.
- Look, can we just talk?
- Robert, can we not?
I am mortified and I really
don't want to rehash it
any more than I already have in my head.
You're with Jackie. I get it.
(SIGHS) Fuck.
Hello, hello, hello, hello!
What a great day. Start of summer.
Full of so much possibility.
Like the daffodils and Jesus,
I, too, have been reborn...
<i>these last few months</i>
spending time with lovely Diane
here in our magical home.
Oh, I feel the same.
And as many of you know,
I am prone to the
passive-aggressive speech.
- Yes.
- But this one is just
aggressive-aggressive. I
love this woman! To Diane!
Diane!
And I'm three sangrias in,
<i>so, uh, forgive me my trespasses,</i>
<i>but, uh, I can't keep it to myself.</i>
I have some very exciting news to share.
Fuck.
Norman is fully healed
from the ACL surgery.
He's gonna be back
out there on the links
stealing our money by June 1st. Norman!
<i>Frances, we need to talk.</i>
Robert, I can... I could really
use some space right now.
- Seriously.
- <i>No, I understand that,</i>
<i>but it would</i> behoove<i> us</i>
if you would just open the door
so we could talk.
- Diane! There's a line!
- The jig is up.
- What jig?
- The police are here.
- They're here for me!
- I highly doubt that.
<i>Oh, shit.</i>
Listen, Frances, that night we fought,
I may have gotten totally drunk,
I may have sideswiped some cars.
There were clearly cameras,
they clearly fingered me.
Jesus, well, did you hurt anyone?
- I don't recall.
- Oh, my God.
I was so sad, Frances.
My only friend that night
was the bottle.
I mean... (STUTTERS)
that's a little dramatic.
I'm... I'm your friend, Diane.
I promise you, I am still your friend,
and if you want to give
that check back to me,
that is completely okay.
I just don't want it
to screw up our relationship.
I can't because I may have accidentally
flushed it down the toilet of
some dive bar in Peekskill.
- Okay, then.
- But I accept your apology.
Well, thanks.
I really need a friend, Frances.
I need you to help me
turn myself in to the Po-po.
All right. Okay, let's go.
I told you to stop having parties.
<i>He's my bro, man.</i>
- I deserve to know what he's done.
- Ow, ow!
Excuse me, officers, officers.
Excuse me, you have the wrong person.
It was I who committed the crime
and... and I shall make it right.
It was me.
Yeah? You embezzled $12 million
from your clients?
What?
This is not the worst
party we've ever had.
Diane! Diane, I love you, Diane.
Oh, my God. Oh, Nick.
Jackie and I are getting married.
He was lying the whole time.
He wasn't in retirement,
he was in hiding!
Ugh, I'm Ruth Madoff.
I'm gonna be penniless and scorned
and have to go live
with my sister in Boca.
Sweetie, you aren't penniless.
You have a $2 million Pelts
and $75,000 in a toilet
somewhere in Peekskill.
Robert is engaged?
What the fuck is that?
- Did you know?
- No.
No, I did not.
Are you okay?
Honestly, uh... I don't know.
I mean, of course, one of us was
gonna move on, but engaged?
This fast? I mean, I...
I still have old pants
of his in the attic.
Oh, my God. Do you think she's pregnant?
I mean, she's definitely
young enough to have a baby.
Anyone can.
Please, there are 65-year-old
grandmothers having babies now.
Well, that would at least explain it.
My God, how do I keep
missing these things? Aah.
I'm like the poster child
for being blindsided.
Sylvia, Robert, it's...
Thought you might need this.
- Thank you.
- You're a doll.
That little Ted is adorable.
(SCOFFS) He's mine.
And his ex-wife's.
That's true.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Closing at 11:00. Strong work ethic.
I'm driving Diane
into the city to see Nick.
In jail.
Did... did you know?
About what he was doing?
No. No, I was completely in the dark.
A lot of bombshells lately.
Hey, look, Frances.
About that.
Yesterday... it's not
how I meant to tell you.
It's... it's not how I wanted you
to find out about Jackie and I.
Wouldn't be my preferred choice, either.
I panicked.
It's as simple as that.
I'm not proud of it.
Is she... you know, is she pregnant?
Oh, God, no.
(CHUCKLES) No.
You happy?
I am.
I can't be late for visiting hours.
You sure you're okay to go in alone?
(SIGHS) Yes, of course.
Go enjoy your nonincarcerated day.
I'll meet you back here at 3:00.
- Okay.
- 3:00.
Keep moving.
Could we move this along, ma'am?
You'll get it all back on the
other side of the screening.
Says you.
<i>Hurry up.</i>
Diane, you look so lovely.
- You look so orange.
- Darling, I'm sorry.
I never meant to drag you
into all of this.
I got carried away
and I will pay the price.
(INHALES) Are we poor now?
Define poor.
I mean, I know I have the Pelts,
but it would break my heart
to have to sell it.
But what else? Are... are
there accounts somewhere?
Like, somewhere top secret?
Maybe just use hand signals
so no one can hear
- what we're talking about.
- Diane, they're going
to seize the Pelts.
- What?
- Well, it was my money that bought it.
Or more accurately, the Zucker
family trust's money, but still.
How could you do this to me?
To us? I never needed the money.
- I fucking loved you!
- Diane, pick up the phone.
- Fuck you!
- Diane, pick up... pick up the phone.
- Fuck you!
- Diane, don't do that now.
- Fuck you!
- Not in front of the guys!
- Fuck you, fuck you!
- Diane, calm...
- Fuck you!
- Come with me, ma'am.
I'm not a ma'am!
Wait for me, Diane!
Is that yours?
Yeah, that one's actually my favorite.
It's mine, too.
Um, I have a gallery
if... if you ever want to chat.
Cool.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
- Well, good luck.
- Thanks. Enjoy the rest of the show.
<i>This is Robert. Leave
your message at the tone.</i>
Oh, hey, it's me.
Um, s... so, yeah,
so take the kids to Italy.
Um, but please show them
more than gelato shops.
Show them... show them
Caravaggio and Titian
and the Duomo in Florence, okay?
Um, yeah.
And congratulations to you and Jackie.
Okay, bye.
Hello.
Hi. Can I help you with anything?
Yes, are you hiring?
Bye.
- Have fun.
- Okay.
Okay?
- Bye.
- Bye.
