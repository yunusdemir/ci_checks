<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>
Where are your keys? I need a car!
Drop the gun!
Is he going
through anything in his personal life?
Breakup? Interpersonal conflict?
No.
What if I can't get past this, Luce?
How will I ever do the job again?
Your wife made a deal
to be a confidential informant.
- What?
- You want me to wear a wire?
He's on to her. He knows she was a cop.
- Damn it. Go. Go, go.
- Police!
They must have gone out the back.
You did this!
You know who I am?
You're Kyle Montgomery.
You're Alex's brother.
Hey!
Okay.
John, are you okay?
I knew it was a mistake.
Nothing you could've done to stop it.
I could've blown the operation
early before she went in.
And then you would've gotten
yourself fired.
Torturing yourself
isn't gonna help us find her.
She's dead, Angela.
Vance killed her the second they
got free of our surveillance.
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.
Just like I always knew
I'd end up looking for her body.
<i>We found her.</i>
<i>Alley on Crenshaw near the 10.
Get here now.</i>
She's alive, but it's not good.
They shot her in the head.
I'm he... I'm here, baby.
I'm here. I'm here.
This is Officer John Nolan.
I was just attacked in my home.
The suspect is in custody.
He's, uh, unconscious but breathing.
Requires an ambulance.
5439 Chautauqua.
Thank you.
This is bad.
But <i>he</i> attacked <i>me.</i>
Yeah, and in five minutes,
this place
is gonna be flooded with cops
who will instantly know
that you and I slept together.
Well, who's to say this
wasn't just a friendly hangout?
At 1:00 in the morning?
I didn't tell investigators about us
when they interviewed me
after your shooting,
and they asked me point-blank
about your relationships.
That's a lie they could fire me for.
Okay, then just go.
Go before they get here.
He knows someone was here.
Look, look.
He has just suffered
a fairly serious head injury.
Odds are he's not
gonna remember anything,
and even if he does,
he didn't see you, okay?
It's a harmless lie, Lucy.
It doesn't change anything
about what happened here.
Just go.
You sure you don't need
to go to the hospital?
No, I'm fine.
Good thing
you got that gun away from him.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Officer Nolan.
I did not expect
to see you again so soon.
Me neither, sir.
Well, can you brief me while
it's still fresh in your head?
Yeah, of course.
Uh, I couldn't sleep,
went to the kitchen for a bite to eat.
I noticed the sliding door was open.
I went to investigate.
That's when he hit me with the bat.
Why didn't he just shoot you?
I think he had something
he needed to get off his chest.
He was clearly feeling guilty
about what happened with his brother.
He said that?
No, not exactly,
but that's what he meant.
How did you overpower him?
I knocked him off balance
when he fired the gun.
The bullet hit the floor over there.
And we fought, and
I threw him through the glass.
And who lives in the big house?
My friend Ben.
Uh, we were college roommates.
He's away traveling.
So you, uh... You were home alone?
Yes, sir.
I was alone.
So what are you doing here?
Why aren't you at the hospital?
Because I can't do brain surgery.
But I can catch the guy who
put that bullet in her head.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Compared to her.
If she survives surgery,
doctor says she might have a chance.
She strikes me as a fighter.
Yeah.
She's definitely that.
Tim...
Wolfe and Vestri were
doing their jobs with Isabel.
Making what happened personal
is not gonna get you what you want.
You understand?
Yeah.
You know what Vance did
to your girlfriend?
Who?
You sent Isabel Bradford out to
make a buy for you last night,
and Marcus Vance shot her in the head.
Ouch.
- Listen!
- Hey, hey!
Carson, today is
not the day to screw around.
<i>Where can we find Vance?</i>
No way.
I tell you that, they'll put
a bullet in my head, too.
<i>Son, you don't have a play here.</i>
If you don't give him up,
every cop in this building
will make sure word gets back to Vance
that you ratted him out.
Officer Nolan, come in.
- Is everything okay?
- Have a seat.
You've officially been cleared
in the Alex Montgomery shooting.
It was deemed a justifiable homicide.
That's a relief. Thank you.
I thought you were calling me
in here for bad news.
Well, there's more.
A new investigation has been opened
into your altercation last night.
Kyle attacked me.
- What is there to investigate?
- It's pro forma.
Shouldn't take, uh, but a day or two.
As long as you've been truthful,
there shouldn't be an issue.
You'll be restricted to the station
while we get this straightened out.
But I'm sure
you could enjoy a day of quiet
after everything you've been through.
Just go ahead and check in
with Officer Yamada
at the front desk.
Thank you.
What happened?
They put me on desk duty
until they investigate.
- What if they find out the truth?
- They won't.
Don't worry. It'll be fine.
Uh, are we okay?
Yeah, why?
Oh. Right.
Look, hooking up was
a heat-of-the-moment thing.
We just need to make sure
that we don't do it again.
Yeah.
What's going on in roll call?
Oh. Wolfe and Vestri got
a couple possible locations
on the dealer that shot Tim's wife,
so we're getting ready
to hunt the guy down.
Be careful.
Yeah. You too.
So, according to Carson,
Vance is most likely located
at a warehouse facility
in South Gate at this address.
All right, Detectives Wolfe and Vestri
will stake it out with
patrol units from that division,
while you guys will head over
to Bronson Estates,
where Carson says Vance's
girlfriend, Cesiah Olivo, lives.
But Carson doesn't
know which apartment she lives in,
so we'll have to do
some knocking on doors.
All right, listen up.
This has the potential of being
a very dangerous operation.
Vance is a heavy hitter.
He has a well-armed crew.
So he won't go down easy.
All right, watch each other's
backs out there,
and be careful.
Hey, I'm so sorry about Isabel.
Yeah. Thanks.
Go kit up our shop.
Ask Mike for the Bradford Special.
What is that?
You'll see.
Fill out one of these.
Officer Yamada? Uh, John Nolan.
I've been assigned to
your watch for the time being.
Didn't think they made rookies my age.
Yeah, well, with age
comes wisdom, right?
My wisdom's about to retire.
In two weeks, I'll be drinking mojitos
on my houseboat in Havasu.
Sounds very nice.
So, what do we do here...
just help people
who walk in off the street?
Well, this may look like reception,
but we're really the front lines.
We get all sorts of people
coming in here,
with all kinds of complaints.
So, what do we do?
You fill out one of these.
Stamp it right here, in
the uppermost right-hand corner.
Give the complaint filer a copy.
- And then what?
- That's all.
Give it a try.
- Oh.
- Unh-unh.
Not bad.
But it's important the stamp
stay within the confines
of the designated area.
You got some line crossage.
Do it again.
Dad, hey.
Heard you were tasked
to the shooting of that C.I.
Yes, sir.
You here to tell me to be careful?
Well, that goes without saying.
No, I want to ask you
about your friend Nolan.
Why? I heard he was cleared
on the shooting.
He was. It's just, uh,
most officers never face
a fatal shooting
or a violent home invasion.
Nolan's had both in a 48-hour span.
Look, if you're concerned
about his head space,
don't be.
Okay, he was the guy at the Academy
talking everyone else off the ledge.
He's just hit some bad luck.
Hmm.
You don't think so?
Yeah, let's...
let's just say something
feels a little off.
Be careful out there.
Are you deaf?
I said Shakespeare stole my dog.
<i>The</i> Shakespeare?
- Is there more than one?
- I don't know.
You said your name was "Flawless."
I'm just trying to roll with it.
Can I help you?
Can you arrest someone
for being incompetent,
uncaring, self-centered, unfaithful,
and pathologically late?
I wish. What's this about?
My husband... Ex-husband.
Soon-to-be ex-husband.
We have our custody exchange
scheduled for now,
and he's late, as usual.
Scheduled for here at the station?
Yes. Here.
Court ordered. W-What are you, new?
Actually, yeah, I am.
You seem kind of old to be new.
Uh, thank you?
Look, Wendell's father
and I hate each other
with the passion
of a thousand burning suns.
So the judge thought the police station
would be the best place
for us to make our switch.
- Makes sense.
- Only I am going to get fired
if I'm late for work again.
So can I leave him with you?
Oh.
Um... yeah, of course.
- Just make sure he has your number.
- Thank you.
Wendell, I've got to go.
Your dad will be here any minute.
- Officer...
- Nolan.
...will look after you
until then, okay?
I love you.
Thanks.
So, how's it going?
Thought I was going to soccer practice.
Instead, I'm stuck in the lobby
of a smelly police station.
I feel your pain.
Let's gear up.
Got your backup piece?
Uh, yeah, of course.
What's this?
Trauma plate for your vest.
Little extra protection.
Oh. Bradford Special.
You really think we're gonna need this?
You know why they call
this place the Bronson Estates?
'Cause a guy named Bronson built it?
No. Back when you were in short pants,
there was a movie called "Death Wish."
- Starred Charles Bronson.
- Yeah. For a long time,
responding to a call here
meant that you had a death wish.
But it's better now, right?
It's no longer the wild, wild west.
Lots of low-income families live here.
But it never hurts to be cautious.
Hey.
What happened at Nolan's last night?
How should I know?
Thought you might have talked to him.
Is there more to the story
I haven't heard?
Uh, no. I mean, I don't know.
Why?
No reason.
Let's go.
A little extra shock and awe?
Damn straight.
We're here to talk to people,
not scare the hell out of them.
Speak for yourself.
All right.
Let's do this.
This'll go faster if we split up.
You all right riding solo?
Have you met me?
Okay. Chen and I will start
on three. You take two.
Jackson and Lopez will ground floor it.
Stay in constant radio contact.
What a gentleman.
All I could find were these.
I thought maybe you could color them.
Cool. You got crayons?
Um, maybe. Let me check.
Looking for something?
Uh, yeah. Crayons.
Long story.
- You got a minute?
- Yeah. What's up?
Maybe we should go somewhere
a little more private.
- Seems serious.
- Oh, not at all.
It's just, something's come up
that I need to get clarity on.
Kyle Montgomery,
the man who attacked you,
he claims that you lured him
to your house
in order to kill him.
That's ridiculous. Why would I do that?
That's what I thought.
But I have to ask...
You didn't do that, right?
No.
Great.
Good.
Oh. You know, he also said
one other thing.
He insists there was
someone else at your house.
Says he heard a voice
before you knocked him out.
You said you were alone, right?
Yeah.
Are you lying to me, Officer Nolan?
No, sir.
Get away!
Get out of here.
Something bothering you, Officer Nolan?
- Uh, no, I'm fine.
- Liar.
I just had, uh,
an intense couple of days,
and I'm not quite sure
how to talk about it yet.
Long as you're clear with yourself,
there's no reason
you have to share anything.
I'm taking the kid for a snack.
Mind the fort.
Yes, sir.
Yo.
How can I help you?
I'm, uh, Jeff Turner.
I'm here to pick up
my... my son. Wendell.
Right. Officer Yamada just took him
to the break room for a Doritos run.
They shouldn't be a few minutes.
Do you have any photo I.D.?
Oh, yeah.
Mr. Turner, have you been drinking?
No, no.
I mean, you know, not really.
Just a little... a little eye-opener.
That's not a thing.
How'd you get here? Did you drive?
No.
No, um... Uber.
Why don't you come with me?
Right over here.
I'm gonna let you sober up
in here for a little while.
I can't let you take your son
home in this condition.
And I don't think you want
to let him see you like this.
- I'm fine.
- Or I can arrest you
for being drunk and disorderly,
and you can see how much fun
L.A. County Prison is.
- Who's there?
- Gas company.
Cesiah Olivo. Just the woman
we're looking for.
- Marcus isn't here.
- Yeah, we're gonna need to be sure.
- Hey, you can't...
- Sit!
Clear.
Clear.
When's the last time
you heard from Vance?
Yesterday.
He was supposed to come over
last night. He never showed up.
You know who he is?
What he does for a living?
Yeah.
- And you're okay with that?
- No.
But I was pregnant
by the time I found out.
And he made me move in here
so his guys can keep an eye on me.
- Make sure I don't go anywhere.
- So you're a prisoner.
No.
But he had a son
who died in a car accident.
He needs to make sure
nothing happens to our baby.
You want out, we can get you out.
Only if I give him up.
Forget it.
- If we...
- Cesiah, do you really want
a guy like that
taking care of your child?
There's no guarantee
that he'll keep you around
after this baby is born.
All you have to do is call him.
Say you're not feeling well.
You're worried about the baby.
I can't.
It's one call.
We get him out of your life for good,
make sure you and the baby are safe.
You promise?
He hurt someone I care about.
He's going away forever.
Hello?
It's me.
Why are you calling?
You need to come over. I...
I don't feel right.
I-I'm worried that
there's something wrong.
I'm sure everything's okay.
You're probably just overreacting.
I'm not.
What if there's something wrong
with the baby?
Okay, okay. Stay put.
I'll come over as soon as I can.
Are you friends
with people in the building?
No. I keep to myself most of the time.
So you haven't seen this girl?
Sorry. Never seen her before.
Who is she? Did she do something bad?
She's a person of interest.
You sure you haven't seen her?
100%. I'd remember her.
What about this guy? You seen him?
Nope.
Anybody else here?
No.
Okay. Thanks for your time.
7-Adam-19.
Shots fired at Bronson Estates.
Tim, um, we're hearing gunshots.
What's your status?
Talia, are you there?
Control, respond.
Marcus has a frequency jammer
in the basement.
One of his guys
brought it back from Iraq.
No signal.
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Radio's not working. Try yours.
Look out!
We need to get out of this hallway.
We don't have time for packing.
We gotta go.
- Hush.
- I need things for the baby.
I can't leave here without them.
It's okay. We're gonna get you
to a safe place.
- When are you due?
- A week ago.
Vance. Your boyfriend's here.
To the police officers inside,
I'm here for Cesiah.
She walks out, you walk away.
Otherwise, we're gonna
come in and take her.
No, you're not.
'Cause you can't risk her
getting hit in the crossfire.
You give up, we'll make sure
she goes to the hospital
- when the baby comes.
- Forget it.
I'm not leaving here without my kid.
Then I'd say we're at a stalemate.
- What are you doing?
- I bought us a little time,
but they're coming through
that door soon enough.
And I'm not sure we can stop them.
I think I know what happened.
I had the TV on back at the house.
"SportsCenter."
Kyle must've heard that
and got confused.
Yeah. Could be.
Let me ask you this...
When I was there,
I noticed the shower was wet,
but you weren't.
Caught me.
I'm an East Coast guy.
I cannot get used to
this desert L.A. air.
I sometimes use the shower
as a makeshift humidifier.
You know there's a drought.
Yes, sir. I'll stop doing that.
Um, I should get
back to the front desk.
You have a son, don't you?
Yes, sir.
His name is Henry. He's 18.
The biggest sin for my kids was lying.
I told Jackson from an early age...
I can forgive anything but dishonesty.
I told my son something similar.
You have till the end of the day
to amend your statement.
After that...
Understood.
What do you want?
I'm sorry, but I need to come in.
Are you here alone?
No, my husband's here.
What's happening?
There are at least three active
shooters in this building.
I've lost comms,
and four of my fellow officers
are in danger.
Oh, I-I stopped paying
the bills months ago.
My husband has cancer.
And all of the money
goes to his treatment.
Look, he can barely
get out of bed anymore.
And you are putting him in
jeopardy by just being here.
I'm sorry, but until
I think of a better option,
you're stuck with me.
Now, if you could find
some medical supplies,
I'd love to take care of this arm.
Oh, God. Of course.
If I have anything,
I have medical supplies.
The phone doesn't have a signal either.
Must be a jammer.
Police! Drop the bags!
Show me your hands!
Don't shoot!
Lopez.
Which one's your apartment?
- Why?
- You don't want to find out.
We need to get out of this hallway.
Vance said no witnesses!
Tell him we're going upstairs!
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?
You don't have a warrant,
and I didn't invite you in.
So you can't conduct a search.
Clear.
We're stuck.
Think the others are all right?
I hope so.
You okay?
- A contraction.
- Okay.
- Really big one.
- All right.
Maybe you should sit down.
How long until
somebody knows we're missing?
It might be a while. We're
on special assignment here.
They don't expect us
to check in regularly.
They blocked the peephole.
What, so we're blind?
No, we're not.
- Find me some tape.
- Oh!
Cesiah, do... do you have any tape?
Front, front. Just...
Give me your body cam.
Put tape right here.
There's a body-cam app
on your city-issued phone.
Open it.
They're getting ready to come in.
Help me barricade the door.
- Lucy.
- Yeah?
My water just broke.
What are we gonna do?
If they break through the door,
we're gonna get overrun.
Gotta get to them first.
Okay.
Stop, stop! You're gonna hit Cesiah!
- Hold it! Hold it!
- Get 'em out of here.
All right, go, go, go, go. Go.
Boss, we need to go.
At some point, the cops
are gonna send backup
when these guys don't report in.
I'm not leaving without my kid.
Then you need to find a way fast.
Should we move her to a different room?
No... Looks like we're clear for now.
I need to go to the hospital.
- The baby's coming.
- Yeah, no, I know, I know.
But that's not possible right now.
Wait. So, what?
You're gonna deliver my baby?
Uh...
Yes.
Yes, I guess I am.
These cops forced
their way into my apartment.
They refuse to leave.
We're trying to stay alive.
You got a problem with that?
Yeah, my brother's doing 20 years
for something he didn't do.
So, yeah, I got a problem with that.
Look, I appreciate
where you're coming from,
but we're not here to cause trouble.
We're here because
somebody's trying to kill us.
Vance?
- You know him?
- Yeah. Enough to steer clear.
He's got a dozen guys living here.
- You walked into a buzz saw.
- No kidding.
We need to call for help,
but he's jamming our signals.
Any idea how we fix that?
Shut the power off in the building.
Jammer should go off.
How do we turn off the power?
Main circuit breaker's in the basement.
I know this because I see it
every time I'm doing my laundry.
It's not gonna be easy
getting to the basement.
I only have two magazines left.
Me too. And those are
gonna go real quick
if we get into trouble outside.
W-What are you doing? Hey.
Why are you knocking my wall?
Maybe we don't need to go
outside to get to the basement.
Will my dad be here soon?
Yeah.
I'm sure he'll be along any minute.
You think maybe he forgot about me?
Oh.
Wendell, your dad's
actually here already.
He was only a few minutes late.
- But when he arrived...
- He was drunk.
Yeah.
I'm having him sleep it off
in one of the cells.
He's drunk a lot.
That's why they're getting divorced.
But my mom says it doesn't
mean he loves me any less.
Well, she's right.
And I'm sorry I lied to you.
I should have been honest.
I thought
I was protecting you, but I...
I see you deserve the truth.
It's okay.
My folks lie to me a lot these days.
I know they mean well, but...
it just makes things
a lot worse, you know?
Oh, come on. Come on.
Hey.
Hey! Come on! What are you doing?!
You're wrecking my kitchen.
Who's gonna pay for this?
L.A.P.D.
And if they don't, send the bill to me.
Next stop. Basement.
Control, show us out of our car,
Bronson Estate.
Any word from the officers inside?
<i>Negative.</i>
If you want something done right,
you gotta do it yourself.
Get beside me.
Go!
This way!
- Found one!
- Shoot him!
Shoot him, shoot him!
Get back! Get back!
You good to walk?
- Yeah.
- I'm not.
Come on.
Can you get some towels please?
- Yes. Hold on.
- Okay.
Help me take off his vest.
He...
Oh, my God. Is he dead?
It's okay. Just... Just breathe.
I know that sounds cliché,
but I promise it does work.
Have you done this before?
No, no.
But I aced it at the Academy.
I know...
Your birth plan didn't
involve a cop and your couch,
but I promise you, I will protect you
and your baby. Okay?
Okay.
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.
I assume this is another test.
They don't stop
just 'cause we're pinned down.
And let's face it, you'd
think less of me if they did.
Yes. Okay.
- Are you sure about this?
- We can't let him bleed out.
Just don't let it turn white.
If it's too hot, it'll do
more harm than good.
Identify. Isolate.
Repair or close.
- A-Are you talking to me?
- No.
I'm just trying to remember
how they taught us
to cauterize an artery.
Okay. Isolate.
Okay.
You ready for this?
- Here.
- Ready or not.
Okay.
Is it okay?
- No, it's still bleeding.
- You've got this.
I-I have faith.
Close.
You did it.
It won't matter if we can't get him
out of this building soon.
Secure the back hallway.
I'll keep an eye on the stairs.
- Any idea what's going on?
- Code Red, man. We're locked in.
- Who's there?! Come on!
- Right.
Power's out.
7-Adam-15.
Officer needs help at Bronson Estates.
Officers down, multiple gunmen.
Send airship, S.W.A.T.,
R.A.s... everything you got.
<i>7-Adam-15, roger that.
Help is on the way.</i>
Commander West, if you have a moment.
There's something I'd like to tell you.
A distress call just came in.
Citywide, tactical alert.
Percy, come with me.
Your son is one
of the officers involved.
Why are you standing there?
It's all hands on deck.
It's a girl.
Good job, Boot.
What's wrong?
Something's not right.
Look out!
- Come here.
- No.
No!!
- No!
- Hey!
No. No!
No! No!
No!
No! No!
- Hey!
- Come on!
- Get him!
- Hey!
Aah!
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.
You have the right
to an attorney present.
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you.
- Stop! Freeze!
- Freeze!
On your knees. Put your hands
behind your head... now!
- I'm out.
- Me too.
On your stomach!
Get down on your stomach right now!
- Now!
- Get down!
Do it again! Hands behind your back!
Give me your hand! Right hand.
Don't you move.
Come on. Get up. All right.
Dad?
Come on.
They're gonna take you to the hospital,
make sure everything's okay.
- Then what happens?
- Whatever you want.
You're free now, Cesiah.
You and your baby.
I'll check on you later.
Thank you.
You're gonna be okay.
Vestri?
I just want a second with him.
I can't think of a worse idea.
Don't let me regret this, Tim.
The woman you shot
and threw in a dumpster...
Her name is Isabel Bradford.
She's my wife.
I don't know what you're talking about.
But a dead cop's wife
always makes me happy.
She's not dead.
And when she gets on the stand,
she's gonna put you away
for the rest of your life.
Hey. You okay?
- Uh, sure.
- Can we talk?
Can it wait?
Uh, I have so much paperwork to do.
I'm afraid this is a little
more important than paperwork.
Um, Commander West
knows there's something off
with my story.
I think I should just come clean.
No.
I think he's gonna understand
that your being there
- had nothing...
- John. John, no.
He will not understand.
We lied. We'll both get fired.
And for what?
So you can feel better about yourself?
The truth matters.
Listen to me.
Um, the world isn't black and white.
And it won't be better
with us off the force.
We're out there making a difference.
Think about everybody you have helped.
Now think about
what would have happened
if you weren't there.
Don't throw it all away
for a false moral moment.
Yeah.
Come in.
We wanted to update you
on the Kyle Montgomery investigation.
Okay.
I'm clearing you
for active duty, Officer Nolan.
- Meaning case closed?
- Yes.
I believe Kyle Montgomery
attacked you in your home
and you acted appropriately,
using non-lethal force to subdue him.
Also, your bravery and competence today
proves to me that you're ready
to return to the field.
Officer Nolan, you don't seem happy.
No. Um... I am, I am.
I...
Becoming a police officer
has been one of
the most meaningful things
I've done with my life.
It's just...
been a long couple of days.
Well, that's understandable.
Why don't you go home
and get some rest?
- Tomorrow's a new day.
- Thank you.
Hey. I'm here.
I...
I-I didn't know that...
rock bottom...
had a basement.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh, I was out, trying to clear my head.
I kind of just drove here on autopilot.
I'm glad you did.
Oh, God. Tough day.
Yeah.
I heard you got cleared for duty.
Commander West closed the file.
- Good.
- It is.
Can I admit something?
Of course you can.
I didn't drive here on autopilot.
I, um...
I've had a really tough day,
and I know things
are complicated between us,
but maybe we could talk... sometimes...
as friends?
I would love that.
I delivered a baby.
- That's amazing.
- Then I got shot.
In the vest.
- It still counts.
- Well...
You should see the bruise.
It's just, like...
Mm.
Well, I'm... I'm good.
I got enough bruises of my own.
- You gonna share that beer?
- Uh, no.
Okay.
So, should we get some pizza?
I already did.
It should be here any second now.
Wow, that's confidence.
Well, more like hope.
You are a sucker for pizza.
Officer Chen, you know me too well.
