Please tell me what happened to my husband seven years ago.
To be honest...
when my son Junichi turned 10 he died of a liver disease.
There's something suspicious about the death of your son.
Let's fight it together.
Do you remember hearing the words 'perfect blue'?
A guy called Yuki-san...
came to burn incense for Junichi before.
I'm sure he said something like that.
Yamase.
Please treat me well, Coach.
Well then, shall we start?
You got big, Morooka Kazuhiko.
So you can cook after all?
But this is just cut cheese.
That's why.
I wonder if Master will come back soon.
Is it Master?
Hello?
- Shinya? It's me.
Dad.
Do you know where Kazuhiko is?
He said he'd meet Yamase.
But I can't contact him anymore.
You're quite worried about brother, but you don't care about me.
You're wrong.
I got a strange phone call from Kazuhiko.
A strange phone call?
It's not over, save me.
I'm looking for him right now, but I can't find him.
I got it. I'll search too.
What happened?
It looks like dad got a phone call from my brother where he said...
'It's not over, save me'.
It's not over?
Could it be that warehouse?
Wait! Come, Masa!
My name is Masa. A former police dog.
This is from my brother.
When I was still on duty...
I witnessed a lot of sad fates.
But I don't know if I've ever seen...
a cruel ending like this.
That was certainly a nightmare-like scene.
Translation/Sync: Super Saiyan
Big thanks to furransu!
Kayoko!
Shinya.
Was it really Kazuhiko?
No doubt, they said.
Shinya...
Why are you here?
Why are you alive?
Why didn't you die?
Hisako, stop it!
Kazuhiko.
Kazuhiko...
Say something nice for a change.
Really...
preferring having me dead instead of my brother...
Hisako!
Most likely, the cause of death is because of being hit at his head.
He didn't die because of the fire?
Someone beat him to death and lit him on fire later.
Could you tell me about when you found him?
It's Yamase!
Excuse me!
- Miyamoto!
Yamase!
Move it!
It looks like Yamase Hiroshi is...
most definitely the killer of Kazuhiko.
We found a will in Yamase's apartment.
[I know I was wrong. But Kazuhiko's righteousness was hard to me. That why I killed him, and killed myself too. I'm a coward.]
Yamase...
What's the meaning of this? Killing another person.
Do you think I did it?
But the other day, a producer for a tv station got killed.
Don't ask unnecessary things. Concentrate on your mission.
Withdrawal?
I heard it from Kazuhiko-kun's baseball coach.
He said he'd give up on Koushien this spring.
I see.
Shinya-kun, isn't it good to go home?
Why are you alive?
Why didn't you die?
I'm no longer part of that house.
Is Kayoko-san alright?
Even though she thought she solved the incident between Kazuhiko-kun and Yamase-kun.
It had quite an impact on her.
Nana-san...
Everyone's worried.
I'm sorry.
But...
But people close to me dieing...
it's unbearable.
It's no good, huh?
I want to be stronger like Nana-san.
I'm not strong.
It's hard for me.
Seeing people die.
My father and mother died also died.
I've never heard that.
Nana-san?
It was a double suicide.
They left me behind.
Why?
When they found out my father embezzled money from the company...
he got into great debt. That's why.
I'll be honest with you.
I've hated them all the time.
People like Kayoko-san.
Saving people of you believe in it is a beautiful thing.
Even though in the end people are all selfish.
I don't want to think that.
I'm sure your parents...
If that's the case...
proof it to me.
That you're not wrong.
And that I'm wrong.
Everyone, I'm sorry for the trouble I caused.
Back to work.
- Ah, Chief.
Like this, the Hasumi Detective Agency...
is starting their business today again, but...
the gear of a cruel fate...
had started turning that time without knowing.
Yamase-san.
He didn't do it.
I can't believe Hiroshi would kill Kazuhiko-kun.
I also talked to the police but they didn't want to listen.
That's why I ask of you. Please investigate it!
What do you mean?
He was really regretting it.
Threatening Kazuhiko-kun.
Taking you at your word, only that...
It's not just that. He...
said he'd be Kazuhiko-kun's coach...
and took out the glove he put away.
Yamase-kun...
He definitely didn't do it.
And he'd never take his own life!
I got it. We'll take on your request.
Chief!
It doesn't mean that the result of the investigation isn't a cruel one.
We'll investigate as much as we can.
That's fine right, Kayoko?
Yes.
Kazuhiko-kun and Yamase-kun got killed?
Yes, and...
There's something I'd like to ask about the two...
who played baseball with your son Junichi-kun.
I wondered if you know something about them from the past?
I remember them being really close.
That's right, I have a video that was taken at that time.
Would you like to see it?
Alright! It's almost time to take a break!
Yes!
Junichi, speak properly.
I got it. Are you filming this properly mom?
Seconds!
It disappeared already.
- Yuki-san!
Could you give some more?
- Yes.
Please.
- Excuse me.
Everyone, would you like some more drinks?
- Yes!
It's a good thing that we can borrow the ground for free, isn't it?
Opening specially for us.
It would be nice if there'd be more grounds like these.
Don't do that!
Don't joke around!
I never thought something like this would happen.
Can we borrow this DVD?
Yes, no problem.
Thank you.
But if you look at it again like this...
such an energetic Junichi-kun...
Why did he suddenly...
At the hospital I was told it was a liver disease...
But his symptoms were strange.
What do you mean?
At first...
it was hard for him to swallow things.
After that gradually his arms and legs would become numb and shaky.
Like that...
How's the investigation going?
- Nothing at the moment.
If Yamase really isn't the culprit...
the things he said about suicide in his will...
It's valid to say that someone planned this out, right?
It looks like Yamase-kun was in big trouble.
What kind of after-effects did he have?
At first he had a tough time drinking...
and after that his arms and legs got numb and shaky.
Wait a minute. Yamase-kun too?
If that's the case, than Yamase's after-effects...
are not because of the accident.
And Junichi-kun, Kazuhiko-kun and Yamase-kun...
from the same baseball team...
are all dead.
I don't think it's just a coincidence.
Wait, what are you talking about?
That's right. Who is Junichi?
Today we met a person called Soda Yaeko-san.
Seven years ago, dad...
was investigation a medical error at a certain hospital.
It seems that they met a couple of times back then.
Dad did?
But why Master too?
Master...
has been taking care of us all this time.
What do you mean with that?
Master.
The injury of your mother the other day...
wasn't because she fell of the stairs.
Was it really a coincidence that you saved me?
To be honest...
before I opened La Scena I...
was a crisis management consultant for businesses.
It's a job where you protect businesses from takeovers and information leaks.
That time there was something I had someone take care of outside of work.
It was a newspaper reporter.
It was Kouichirou-san.
Eight years ago...
the person who leaked information of medical errors at...
Kawasumi Hospital to Kouichirou-san was me.
If you investigate this you might find something.
Since then, Kouichirou-san...
advanced his behind-the-scenes investigation of Kawasumi hospital.
Isn't it unusual for a 10 year old to...
die because of this?
Sensei, could you tell me what really happened today?
Please!
Sensei!
And the day before Kouichirou-san died...
Kouicjirou-san are you drinking alcohol?
Did something happen about the Kawasumi Hospital case?
Shiina-kun, on this world...
there are things better left unknown.
What happened?
Saying such things.
Kouichirou-san.
Exposing this problem...
might make a lot of people sad.
What do you mean?
If something were to happen to me...
please take care of my wife and daughters.
And that way, Kouichirou-san...
I don't know what Kouichirou-san meant with...
those words back then, but I...
wanted to know in what kind of incident Kouichirou-san was involved in.
I investigated several times, but I couldn't find any clues.
I'm sorry for keeping this a secret all this time.
What happened to your father is my responsibility.
Don't say that.
So you opened a store close to our house...
and instead of my husband you've been taking...
care of our family.
Is that so?
It's like...
we're tied to each other by fate.
We're all connected to the thing that happened seven years ago.
I wonder if there's some connection between these kids and dad.
Are you sure?
Yes, no doubt.
I got it.
I'll take care of it.
And, are you buying it?
Not buying it?
I'm not saying anything without the original!
Are you sure, manager director?
Even if this goes public?
And?
How much do you want?
500 million.
Why do we have to pay that guy money?
I think we should be fortunate for finishing it with money.
If that guy...
was for social justice...
everything would've been over.
I've got something to report.
The footage taken from the baseball team at that time...
is in hands of Hasumi Kouichirou's family.
What did you say?
- Don't worry.
I already took measures.
Itoko-san discovered it, right?
Yes, it was like this when I came back home from school.
Thanks for coming.
Don't worry.
And what was stolen?
A bankbook, a seal and valuables.
Mom.
And I can't find that DVD.
Are you sure?
Who did that?!
But it's a blessing in disguise.
What do you mean?
I found out two things because of this.
The first thing is...
that there's someone who's afraid of the footage of the baseball team from 8 years ago.
That's why he pretended that he was aiming for money and took the DVD.
I see.
- And the second thing?
Originally it was only us here...
who knew we borrowed the DVD from Soda-san.
That's right. Why did he know it was at our place?
That's right. In short, this person used some sort of way...
to get the information and that person for sure is...
the culprit or a partner of the culprit.
I'm sorry for even having you help out cleaning.
No problem.
Where about this?
Not that one. Don't throw it away.
That's the last present dad gave.
-This?
When I cleaned up the second floor...
I found it in the closet.
It was still before Masa was born.
On mt birthday seven years ago.
When I said I wanted to have a dog.
What's this. Perhaps my birthday present?
No, that's...
- You're hasty, dad.
That's right. We haven't even decided what kind of dog we'll keep.
That's why.
- It's alright.
Dad gave it is all to choose it, right?
Thank you. Do your best at work, okay?
Dad, were there some nice dogs?
- That's right.
I want to see too!
- Hey, it's my birthday.
Cute!
Look at this.
Dad too.
- That's right.
There's a Shepard.
- This one's nice.
That's a good one.
- How cute.
Clever.
Soon after that dad died.
Two years ago we started taking care of Masa.
Masa, welcome to the Hasumi family.
Look, it's a present from daddy.
Masa, Masa.
But Masa ignored it.
I'm sure dad cried in heaven.
Maybe.
I see.
Kyoko-san, are you alright?
So many things happened. I'm kind of tired.
You should take a rest. We'll do the rest later.
Thank you. I'll do as you said.
You were a great help.
Physical work is something for guys after all.
Don't say something so distant. We're all in the same boat, right?
But I'm glad...
that the DVD copy wasn't stolen.
Yes, it's important.
This is Kinisuka, it looks like Hasumi Kyoko copied the DVD.
So it was you?
What did Hasumi Kyoko do?
Answer me.
Why are you here? Weren't you taking a rest?
Why do you know?
No one should know about the DVD...
but it leaked out.
I already thought of it.
That someone bugged our house.
So...
the copy of the DVD was a lie.
We used your bug against you.
We wanted to see how you'd react.
Won't you tell us?
What is Perfect Blue?
So it was like that?
I never thought you'd be the traitor.
Do you know with what feelings the chief continued her investigation?
I always thought we were friends.
Who were you calling with?
Who are you working for?!
Answer.
A woman called Ueda Ryoko.
Ueda Ryoko?!
Do you know her?
- Just by name.
Before, in the world of the crisis management consultants where I was a part of...
there were rumors that she's a very skilled person.
Why? Why did you do this?
Your parents, right?
Nana-san told me.
When they found out my father was embezzling money from the company...
they got into great debt. That's why.
So Nana-san remained by herself.
Her parents committed a double suicide.
I see.
In short, to repay the debt of your parents...
you've been working for Ueda Ryoko.
That's right.
It's all because of the money.
- In that case...
there's good and bad things you can do.
- Wait a minute.
I...
don't think of Nana-san as such a bad person.
Kayo-chan, what are you saying?
That's right! She's a traitor!
Nana-san is the victim!
Kayoko-san...
Certainly...
what Nana-san did is unforgivable.
But Nana-san...
cheered me up after I was down because of the incident.
Furthermore...
she told us the name Ueda Ryoko.
She did it even though she should stay silent.
As friends from the same agency...
I want to believe Nana-san.
You can't contact Kimisuka Nana?
They probably exposed her identity.
What are you doing?
We already paid that guy 500 million.
Don't worry.
We have a prospect for retrieving it.
Excuse me.
Yes?
- This is Kimisuka.
I'm sorry, my identity has been exposed. I can't operate anymore.
I got it. I'll see you at the usual place.
Yes.
I want to ask you for a favor.
I want you to find out information...
related to 'perfect blue'.
I wonder if this is the right way.
It'll be alright.
If it's Nana-san, I'm sure...
There was an embezzlement incident by Kimisuka-san...
Whatever difficult request they got so far...
the girls haven't arrived at the truth that's hidden in darkness.
Yuki-san's contact information?
- Yes.
Just a moment.
Right now in that darkness some light is shining.
Entrusting everything to the traitor, as if they're desperate.
Right now the girls are on the verge...
to reach the truth.
How much do they know?
Nothing yet.
- I see.
Isn't it time for you to tell me?
What Perfect Blue is.
You don't need to know.
It's fine as long as you do as I tell you.
But more than this...
I can't operate if you don;t tell me the information.
If you know...
you can't pull out anymore.
I'm prepared.
It's time to take up this job.
Fine.
I'll tell you.
Perfect Blue is...
Express delivery!
- Yes.
No way.
Well then... it's time for me to go back to the mission.
Wait.
There's no place for you to go back to.
If you continue a job like this...
there are times you don't know...
who your friends are.
And who your enemies are.
Ueda Ryoko is Nana-san's father's incident's...
Yes.
Itoko?
Hello?
Mom...
- Something wrong?
So the people at the agency won't notice...
pretend this to be a normal conversation.
To the Asakura logistics warehouse...
please come together with Hasumi Kayoko.
Ah, I see.
If you talk about this with others than your family.
You know what will happen to her, right?
Yes, I got it.
Something wrong with Itoko?
She had a little trouble at school.
I'm sorry guys...
Kayoko and I have to go somewhere today.
Are you alright?
- Don't worry.
Kayoko.
Itoko is?!
How was it?
I went to the apartment, but it was empty.
If I'd meet that Yuki guy...
I thought I'd be able to get some clues.
Come.
Itoko!
Mom! Sis!
Are you alright?!
Save me too.
Did I see you somewhere?
Everyone, want another drink?
Why are you here?
That's because...
Nana-san, what does this mean?
Too bad.
She didn't choose you, but me.
I got it. I'll meet you at the usual place.
Nana-san, why?
I never thought I'd meet...
that guy's family in this form.
Don't tell me...
you killed my husband?
That's right.
I'll tell you guys.
There's no point in doing it if you don't do it thoroughly.
Right...
The headline of tomorrow's news...
'Accidental explosion incident'
'four people died' or something like that.
So you gathered us here together to...
Efficient, right?
Instead of killing all of you one at a time...
killing you all together...
Masa!
Cruel!
Wait.
You do it.
I told you, there's no going back.
