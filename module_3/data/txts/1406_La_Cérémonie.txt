Miss! Are you Sophie Bonhomme?
Yes. I'm Catherine Lelievre.
-Please sit down.
-Thanks, Madame.
Anything to drink?
Tea perhaps?
No, thanks.
Please have some.
Another cup of tea, please.
I'll explain the whole deal.
We live in a house outside town.
About 10 kilometers from the city.
Large enough.
But in fact we're only three people.
My daughter of my former husband only comes
at the weekends, but not every weekend.
Sometimes we have guests coming over.
This brings some extra work.
-The facilities are good.
-I am not afraid of work, madame.
Usually I do the cooking.
My husband does the shopping once
every week or orders it to be delivered.
So, you'll not be busy.
Oh, I can cook.
The house is far.
Does it trouble you?
I don't know.
It doesn't really matter.
If you want we can take you to
the city once in a while.
You don't need to worry about that.
I also run a small art gallery.
-You want to see my references?
-Sure.
Mrs Anna Dutoit can't keep me any more
because her husband passed away.
She will go and live with her son
in Australia.
Oh, I see.
-You can start working right now?
-Yes.
I stayed with her for a long time.
There were never any problems.
She can tell you.
This is the phone number and address.
I will call tonight then?
I guess there are no problems.
It's very hard to find the house
first time 'round.
I will pick you up at the train station.
Have you checked the train schedule?
When I arrive you mean?
9 o'clock in the morning.
When can you start? Tuesday?
Tuesday?
What's today?
-Saturday.
-You still have Sunday and Monday for yourself.
No problem. Tuesday is ok.
Thanks, Madame.
Then see you on Tuesday.
The salary Mrs Anna paid me was
5500 francs.
-Oh, sorry, 6000?
-Ok.
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Well?
-I'll tell you...
Where were you last night?
We all waited for you.
I had no time last night.
But, you could have called.
You didn't come.
You father wondered were you were.
-Do you need any help?
-No, I can manage.
Where are the boys?
The satellite system arrived.
They are zapping thru the channels.
-This is great.
-Outstanding.
-Make up your mind
-What do you want to see?
The sunset.
-How did it go?
-I met her. I think she's good for the job.
-What are they talking about?
-Not the TV, that's for sure.
-We are getting a new servant.
-"Servant" sounds so demeaning.
How is she?
-What's her name dear?
-Sophia.
Too bad.
I think this servant is
taking care of the old man only.
Don't say that.
You will see.
A female housekeeper.
-You are right.
-A House-KEEPER.
-Does it taste good?
-Good.
-The new witch, does she know how to cook?
-Watch it gilles.
Where does she come from?
I phoned her former employer.
She said she was very good.
You mentioned that it was
a trial period, right?
I forgot to tell her.
I have a feeling it will work
out fine.
I trust that feeling of yours.
Is she ugly?
Why do you ask that?
Are you interested in her?
My son likes beauty.
It's a normal question to ask.
You understand me, sure.
I am your son.
Listen, I don't know if she's ugly but..
she is not looking
like a lizard, that's for sure.
I hope she is not
as fat as the last one.
Of course not.
Finished eating?
One second.
All i leave is the shells.
She is coming next Tuesday.
9 o'clock in the morning.
-I thought you missed it.
-No, I came earlier.
I hope you didn't wait too long?
No! -Follow me.
The car is out front.
I was lucky finding a spot.
-Mrs Lelievre?
-Jeanne Marchal! I work at the post office.
-Can you drop me off?
-Yes.
Annie is there by herself,
and the bus leaves in an hour.
I won't take much of your time.
Sophie. Sit in front with me.
I took some time off.
A 3-day holiday to visit my family.
-You never take out longer vacations?
-No, that's not for me.
Sophie, see whether there still are
cigarettes in the glove compartment.
The royale's thanks.
Sorry!
Thanks!
-See you!
See you!
I'm sure she wonders who you are.
My husband can't stand her.
This is as heavy as lead.
Don't worry. The house is easily maintained.
-Sorry.
-Follow me.
You are strong.
Here is your room.
The shower is outside in the hallway.
Make yourself comfortable and
I'll show you around later.
-I can do it now.
-No, I'll have a coffee while you unpack.
-Do you like the room?
-I don't know, Madame.
I think it will do just fine, thanks.
This is what you are in charge of.
We will have a closer look later.
Follow me.
The vacuum is under the stairs.
This is the dining room.
Be careful. The wall is fragile.
This the hallway.
Soap and water will be fine.
The bedroom.
Please change the sheets.
I'll let you clean up in here.
This is the library.
Oh, I am late.
Is everything clear?
I think so.
Then, I have to run.
I will be back at 6 o'clock.
Call me at the gallery if you want.
The number is beside the phone.
Gilles will be home at 5.
Dirty.
Did you make any vegetables?
They are ready Madame,
I will bring them right away.
-Is she good?
-So far, very good.
Everything is clean, and the
food is excellent.
Will she meet your standards?
Yes, not bad.
Put it on the table
and we can help ourselves to it.
Yes, Madame.
We might have to teach her how
to serve properly.
I'm sure she knows how to.
We are not demanding an exam, are we?
When are we leaving, dad?
The boat will be in Bonifacio from the 20:th.
-I'll get the plane tickets.
-Hopefully it won't be like last year.
We can stay longer if you want?
No, I want to see my dad.
His birthday is coming up.
He is waiting for me.
Is Sophie going as well?
-No, she just came here.
I don't think her circle of friends
is fairly big. No letters, no phonecalls.
Luckily, she has the TV.
This chicken looks magnificent.
I'm sure you want her to be inside
watching the telly.
For me it's perfect.
No small talk or boring conversations.
She's a human being, not a machine.
Now you're over-reacting a bit,
aren't you?
Sophie, can you clean the table please?
-Perfect, but the books are still there.
-I'd rather have that, than she going thru my stuff.
You're pushing her too hard.
Why can't she have the car?
-Why can't she borrow yours?
-I don't think she knows how to drive.
Well then..
We might want to get her some lessons?
Don't smoke.
Once you start, it's hard to quit.
There is one thing i don't understand.
Why don't you use the washing machine?
I don't feel like it.
I don't like machines.
Sophie. If you want to go to the city,
my wife can lend you her car.
I can't drive.
But, if you want to get a license
we can pay the driving lessons.
Impossible.
My eyesight is too bad.
-But, you don't wear glasses?
-I don't know.
I lost them.
Then you have to get new ones.
I'll get an appointment. Friday?
I'll drive you, and Melinda
can pick you up afterwards.
I understand.
Melinda will come to get you at 11.
Have a walk after you're done.
Tell the doctor to send the bill.
Enjoy yourself.
-You don't have any change?
-No.
You see, you have the change you need
here. Here you go.
Can i help you?
Don't you have any less dark?
Yes we do. Come inside please.
They're not too expensive?
No, have a look.
-I only got 100 francs,
-That's enough.
I'll take these.
Sophie. Sorry you had to wait.
No harm done, Madam.
-When do you get the glasses?
-Wednesday.
That's good.
Then you'll be in town again.
-Aren't you bored in the house?
-No, it's fine.
Don't let them work you too hard.
They're very pleased to have you.
Never mind Sophie.
I just want a glass of milk.
"Could you iron my white dress?"
-It's for you.
-I am gonna iron my clothes tonight...
-I'll do it. I like it.
Did you bring the tickets?
Sure, do I look that stupid?
-Give this to Fournier.
-Ok.
Bye, Sophie. I'll send you a postcard.
Hope you are alright.
The groceries will be here during the week.
If you need something else,
just order it.
We will be home again on the 2:nd.
Don't worry. Enjoy yourself, Sophie.
-Don't forget to get the glasses.
-No, madame. Bye.
Hi, here's the stuff
Mrs Lelievres ordered.
One more box.
I am thirsty.
Do you have something to drink? A beer?
Thanks.
No glass, I'm fine.
Did you see the TV show last night?
We did good.
500 000 Francs from Bretagne alone.
-I don't know, I...
-Oh well.
You have to sign the delivery note.
I don't sign for other people.
Then sign your name, it doesn't matter.
Sign please.
That's that.
Ok, I am leaving.
If you want anything...
Give me a call and I'll come.
No, not that one.
This is better and cheaper.
But is it a good brand?
Sure, it says:
"High quality assorted chocolates"
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.
-How are you coming along?
-Fine.
Especially when they are not there, right?
Did they write?
No.
I'm glad they found you.
They've been looking for quite a while.
Thanks, bye.
I have to go back to the house.
Someone might call.
I would have walked with you,
but I need to go back.
I work all day.
Drop by if you're around.
Ok.
There aren't many people visiting,
so I spend my time reading.
I don't want to trouble you, but...
you have received a postcard
so I figured I'd drop by.
-Let me open the door for you.
-Oh, never mind.
Do you have a car?
A piece of garbage, but it
takes me where I want to go.
Here.
I don't have my glasses.
Then I'll read it, if I may?
"We are having a lovely time...
..thinking about you.
Melinda"
I, I don't like going on holidays.
And it's dangerous.
In Corsica, bombs all over
and there are pirates everywhere.
Yeah, those pirates...
They blow up boats.
Wow, this is hugh.
Gotta be hard to clean.
You are welcome to my house.
This is nice.
There is a TV, can I watch?
-How to I turn it on?
-I don't know.
-You never tried it?
-No
How many channels are there?
I grabbed a book.
They won't mind, would they?
"Journey to the center of the earth"
-Any good?
I don't know.
Celine - That's my mom's name.
This is taken from a library.
I would like to have a look upstairs.
Can I?
How do you turn it off?
Ah, I like this kind of arrangement.
-Do they sleep in the same room?
-Yes.
Look at all these clothes.
She used to be a model.
They don't tell anyone, but I know
for a fact that she used to be one.
You didn't see any photo?
I was to be in a commercial when
I was young but they didn't choose me.
They chose a taller girl.
I am sure it was her.
I'd love to be an actress.
Wouldn't you?
I saw her photo.
One day she came to post office
and I recognised her.
She recognised me too.
Or at least she thought she did.
Sure, this is not certain because
she asked me where I had seen her.
I don't understand
why she settles out here?
I think she wants to forget
her past life in Paris.
This house really is the
talk of the town.
All gossip.
And he listens to alot of music, right?
I know a person who plays music
working in that company.
She is his daughter.
Is she a nice girl?
Yes, she is not bad.
Not the biggest or the nicest room,
but rather ok.
Their old TV, I don't have any TV.
If you like,
I can come visit you more often?
First name basis, please.
Can I wash my hands?
Ok, I'll give you my towel.
No need.
See you some other day perhaps?
Every week I go and help out
in the church.
They need volunteers to sort
all the gifts they're getting.
Mainly collect some clothes
and sort them out.
-Are you into that?
-I might.
-Are you off on Sunday perhaps?
-Depends.
Might have known.
They don't even respect the
day of rest.
See you soon.
Thanks for the tour.
Come see me anytime.
It's no hassle.
Battery problem.
Just came out of the repair shop.
Shall I have a look?
Please do, I know nothing about cars.
-I like tech stuff.
-Well, I don't.
I prefer the poetry.
You want to get it published?
No. I will wait.
Try to start it now.
Starts.
The battery is loose.
It shorts out.
You have a rag?
I have handkerchief.
Thanks.
Thanks again.
My pleasure,
but you need to fix it.
That's unexpected.
You seldom come to see me.
We are having a test.
I need to study.
-You still enjoy hunting?
-Maybe. Where are Gilles and Catherine?
Out for a walk.
They're determined to find mushrooms.
Why are you here by yourself?
-Shall I grease the guns?
-Sounds fine.
-Is Sophie taking driving lesssons?
-She hasn't mentioned it since then.
Gilles says that she visits
the town quite often.
Maybe she likes to walk?
-Prepare the guns then?
-Ok, but I won't promise anything.
You never rest?
Busy working on a Sunday?
I like ironing the clothes.
Carry on. Don't mind me.
Ok, sir.
Could you drive me to town?
I don't feel very well.
Ok, no problem. Bye, mom!
Ok, see you tonight
I have a meeting and I don't know
when I'll be back.
I've made a shopping list.
It's by the phone.
You call them at 2 o'clock.
And they will send the goods today.
Don't forget. We need it badly.
Thanks.
Ok, bye.
How are you, Sophie?
Do you think you can help me?
The phone isn't working.
Catherine wanted me to order
some groceries for tonight.
Can you make the call?
Give me the note.
But first, let me fix your phone
No need. Mr Lelievre will fix it.
Why didn't he make the order?
He didn't know about it.
I am stupid, forget to tell him.
Ok, I'll help you.
Hi, I want to make an order , thanks.
This is for the Lelievre Family.
Two packets of spaghetti,
2 sallads, 4 veal steaks
8 lamb-chops.
4 Prime steaks, three boxes of sardines in oil,
Three boxes of sardines, red peppers.
Did you get it all?
Then, 6 bottles of sparkling water.
Yes.
Four packets of coffee.
Yes, "Carte Noir".
Two boxes of tissues.
Five kilograms of detergent.
Ok.
That's it.
Thanks very much.
Ok.
They didn't have sparkling water,
No Coffee, no detergent and no tissues.
Not even the supermarket
has all these things.
Try the shop next door.
Thanks, Bye!
Wait.
Wouldn't you like to see these?
Yes, why not?
Paul Newman, I love him.
-Can I come?
-Sunday.
Company me to the church.
We are having a winter collection.
I wait for you outside the supemarket.
Two boxes of black coffee.
Six bottles of sparkling water,
Omo (brand) detergent and some tissues.
Poor Sophie.
To carry all those bags by yourself.
Come on in.
Thanks, Madam.
They didn't have it all,
-So, I bought the rest in the market
-Thank you Sophie.
...and I like walking.
I almost forgot.
It's Melinda's birthday on Sunday.
We will have some guests.
Can you manage?
Well, I was planning...
to join the activities in the church?
You are?
It's good thing taking care of others.
I'll go there with the lady
from the post office
I see.
Listen to me, if you prepare the most
before you leave, I can fix the rest.
Close the door, it's windy outside.
Would you look at this?
Wait, I'm helping Sophie.
There were no blue tissues.
Oh, Never mind.
What are you doing home?
You see this, eh?
Look, have a look at this package.
It was opened.
Then someone closed it in a hurry.
Is everything there?
It's the present for Melinda.
What will she think?
What if you repack it yourself?
It won't help.
I think this may be the girl in the
post office.
She's in charge of all the packages.
Is that true? You know it clearly.
The girl in the post office
Her daughter was in an accident.
She died.
They didn't have any proof,
She was prosecuted.
How do you know this?
It was all in the newspapers.
Remember?
You know my memory is not the best.
But you can't prove
it's the same person.
I saw her picture in the newspaper.
I recognized her.
I'll prove it to you.
She hasn't seen the last of me.
You don't have any proof.
I would have sued here otherwise.
Sophie, ready?
-Let me help you.
-Thanks, I'm fine miss.
Have you done everything yourself?
No, just the quiches and the pies.
Isn't it 12 yet?
No, just 11.30.
You have plenty of time.
It's Jeremie.
-Jeremie.
-At least he's on time.
Happy birthday.
What is it?
You just have a look.
Has the party started?
Hi.
Ohh, I like it.
They said it was the best.
Shall we say hello?
Concerto for flute & harp K299.
-This is Jeremie.
-Hi there, Jeremie.
-Look what I got.
-How nice.
You know, Jeremie heard
you played Mozart.
Melinda said you were a music lover.
Please sit down.
Welcome.
We are waiting for some friends
and some relatives.
Dear, can you ask Sophie
to bring some ice?
David, my dear friend.
-These quiches are great.
-Sophie made them.
She is a bit odd
But, she is a good servant.
You're lucky!
Hi, thanks for the presents.
The philosopher Paul Nizan said it best:
"No one can state that the 20's
is the best age to be...."
There once was a philosopher who
merely 21 years old, said:
"So, you should enjoy life
work hard to enjoy life..
..to experience much more..
..this is the true value of life"
My god! Who said that?
Nietsche.
You won't have dinner,
more like a moving table. Like a buffet.
That's a great idea.
Thanks, dear.
Did you ask Sophie?
She is not here.
I couldn't find her.
What is going on?
Excuse me.
Sophie.
Sophie.
what?
Jeanne?
You're late.
I couldn't make it on time.
It doesn't matter.
I found these mushrooms.
We'll bring 'em to my place
and fry them.
Then we'll go to the church.
Didn't they let you go?
They have guests.
Melinda's birthday.
I do it all.
-But I ran away.
-I would've liked to see their faces.
It's not just her birthday today.
-It's also mine.
-Really? Congratulations!
