Seriously stop! Seriously.
I'll smoke you out.
Seriously, seriously stop!
What are you doing?
Stop! No! No! Let go!
You're crazy! No! No!
No!
Open up.
No!
Good girl.
Wasn't painful,
was it? No.
In future, if you find
yourself in a situation...
What are you doing?
Get the fuck... You little wanker.
I just need you to go
and score for me, Aaron.
We're in Vegas.
I don't know peeps out here, you know?
It's not a fucking game, Aaron!
Don't put yourself between me and
my problem or I'll fucking destroy you!
Go on now! Why are you still here?
Why are you still here?
Just calm...
Just calm down.
It's not a joke!
It's not funny!
Spilling my narcotics,
fucking me around!
I need you to sort me out!
You spilled my medicine!
You need to remedy it!
This is calm.
Twenty minutes ago,
I was even more calm
when I had my fingers
in your asshole.
You don't want to wait around
for another half-hour, son,
'cause I'll be
fucking you up.
I'll figure it out.
Yeah, you will. Yeah.
Hi. Can I help you?
Yes.
I am trying to look up a friend of
mine who's staying at the hotel.
I don't know what room he's in.
Okay. What's the last name?
It's spelled H...
Okay.
...E- R-O-l-N.
Can you find
that guest for me?
Can you find
that guest for me?
Okay, I see
what you're doing.
I don't think it's funny,
to be honest with you.
I mean, you come here,
you ask me for,
if somebody named Heroin has
checked in the fucking hotel,
'cause you wanna buy drugs
and that's how you do it?
You pretend that it's the last
name of a fucking guest?
Are you out of your mind?
I don't know. I just,
just, just... I just...
I'm looking for my friend Heroin.
Do you know him?
Yeah, I do. He'll be out back of the
Spice Market Buffet in 20 minutes.
I feel like I'm in
<i>2 Fast 2 Furious.</i>
Yo, Brian,
give me my money
or I'm gonna stab you in the fucking stomach,
all right?
Get out of my room, dude.
What are you gonna do?
What... I'm not,
like, involved in this.
Oh, my God!
Where is the hospital?
You take a right
on North Casino Way!
Every street's
called Casino Way!
God, why didn't he take
me all the way to the door?
<i>One, two, three, four</i>
<i>It's just like</i>
<i>coming in the back door</i>
<i>Five, six, seven, eight</i>
<i>Feels great</i>
<i>A ring, a ring</i>
<i>around my dirty posie</i>
<i>My rear pocket is so</i>
<i>fit and so damn cozy</i>
<i>Ring, ring,</i>
<i>ring around my posie</i>
<i>All the boys in town say</i>
<i>I've the tautest of posies</i>
Aldous.
I couldn't get what
you wanted me to get.
Sorry.
Yeah, I forgot
I asked you to do that.
No, that's all sorted.
Turns out,
it's quite easy to get drugs in Las Vegas.
Why do you look
so flustered?
All right, just change and we'll get going,
shall we?
Looking forward
to seeing me dad.
Thanks again for
the suggestion.
Great.
<i>By posie,</i>
<i>I'm talking about my asshole</i>
<i>Jackie Q!</i>
When Frank Sinatra moves his arm,
you can see my dad. There. There!
What about... What was that
fucking album you brought out last?
It was... What was it?
African something or Zambezi,
or what was it?
<i>African Child.</i>
Child. Child. Yeah, yeah,
<i>African Child.</i>
You should have stayed away from that one,
I think.
I think you should've aborted that child, eh?
You got that?
You know, mate?
I loved it.
She loved it, yeah.
Yeah. She really did.
No, she told me
that she loved it.
Yeah? I loved it.
So enlightening.
We didn't order these.
These drinks
are on the house.
Oh, really? Great.
Thank you very much.
Funny, isn't it?
You get rich and then
everything comes free.
Yeah.
So what brings you
to Vegas?
Aldous wanted
to visit you.
No. No, we were
just passing through.
We were near.
Really?
Actually, I've got a show
at the Greek Theatre in LA.
Terrific! Terrific. Great.
It's tomorrow, actually.
Really? Terrific!
We should go see that.
Well, I'm not sure I...
No, I think I'm busy tomorrow night.
I'm busy tomorrow.
Don't worry about it.
It's not set in stone or...
It's actually
very set in stone.
No, some of us have to work for a living, right?
You know.
Yeah, 'cause I remember
I became a rock star
as a result of
winning a quiz show.
What?
All right, all right.
I'll check the schedule.
Dad!
I like it here.
Cheers, son.
Yeah, I like to come here and clear my head.
You remember that first
strip club I brought you to?
I do.
Fondly. Very fondly.
So listen,
what are you going to open with at the Greek?
<i>Love Explodes.</i>
Really?
I think you should open with <i>Going Up.</i>
I love that fucking song.
It's fucking genius. You know,
it's a great thing to open with.
I mean, getting them up,
getting them, fuck,
right there in the fucking palm of
your hand right away. <i>Going Up.</i>
You missed
sound check, bitch!
You know how much
that's gonna cost us?
I apologize. Look,
things got out of control.
But, hey, we're at The Standard now,
so it's all fine,
because we're all
settled in and we're here.
Guess what. I'm downstairs in the lobby.
Why don't you come on down?
You know what? Actually,
Aldous just went to sleep.
So I just think it'd be better if he just, like,
got some rest.
April Fools.
I don't want to hear
that shit. You fucked up.
He doesn't do anything you want him to do!
He's a crazy person!
Okay, shut the fuck up and listen.
There's a change of plans.
I hope you got
a good night's sleep.
We going to party these pussy
limey motherfuckers into the ground.
They gonna be
dying to leave Vegas.
But we gonna have
to mind fuck them.
A deep mind fuck.
Sergio!
Aldous, hey!
Have a drink with us!
Come on!
Whoo! Vegas!
What's up, baby?
Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!
Join in!
Let's get our mind fuck on.
Now, the Rat Pack
was the shit!
Those guys right
there could croon.
Whenever I would hear Frank
or Dean or Sammy sing,
shit would just
warm my heart!
You know, it just makes me fucking tingle!
It's nice, isn't it?
Yeah, I feel that.
I feel that, Sergio.
Sometimes I think that I was
Frank Sinatra in a past life,
even though I was
born before he died.
No, I'm Frank Sinatra.
What? No.
You? No.
No. No, no, no.
Sorry, mate.
You can't be Frank!
Can't be Frank.
No.
Yeah. I'm Frank.
What you trying to say?
I gotta be Sammy?
Yeah.
Why I gotta be Sammy?
'Cause I'm black,
I gotta be Sammy Davis?
Well, you know...
I look more like Frank
than I do look like Sammy!
Hey, so it looks like you got
everything under control,
so I might call
it an evening.
Sit your ass...
Has he been acting like a bitch this whole time?
Yes, he has.
Yeah, he's been a right little bitch.
What are you doing?
You are representing Pinnacle.
Excuse me. Come here for a second.
What's your name?
Destiny.
Destiny, this is Aaron.
He's my personal attendant.
He runs shit for me.
Nice to meet you.
Aaron.
Destiny.
Destiny, pay attention.
You are gonna go and have sex with Aaron.
Right now.
That's disrespectful.
Aaron,
go with your destiny.
That's my name, Destiny.
And you're using it two ways.
I'm actually in a band.
My life is music.
I'm in an all-girl cover band
and we do the
Pussycat Girl's songs.
And we're called
the Pussy Kittens.
Can you hook me
up with Aldous?
Sure.
Cool.
Okay, what are you doing?
What?
Don't do that.
I feel like I want to
show you something.
I feel like I don't
want to see it, though.
All right! Hey!
So that's your vagina.
Right on.
No, but look at it!
Look at the hair.
Look at the pubic hair! It's...
Yeah, it's a microphone.
For my work.
Hello. Testing, one, two, three!
Is this thing on?
Hello?
Hey, so put that away,
all right?
Do you want to
sing hair-aoke?
I'm okay. I'm all right.
Oh, my God.
I think you're really sexy
because you look
like Dennis Quaid.
What? Really?
Randy Quaid, maybe.
Pants off!
No!
Off with the pants.
Honestly...
Pants-off party!
You're acting crazy!
Stop. No!
Hello.
All right.
Fun and games are over.
Let's relax for a second.
Let's just, let's just...
You carry that around with you?
Stop! When's the last time
you Purell-d that thing?
Kiss it.
You like it.
I want to go home!
This is going
inside of you!
No! Get off of me!
What are you doing?
Oh, my God!
Why does this keep happening to me?
Just relax.
No!
<i>Take your medicine.</i>
<i>Yes, yes.</i>
<i>Why does it</i>
<i>have balls?</i>
That was really nice.
No, it's really nice,
you know,
playing together like that.
Yeah.
We should do it
more often.
We should, Dad.
Yeah, you know, there's a ballroom
space opening up at the Golden Nugget.
I know the owner a bit,
you know?
I could hook you up
with a permanent gig there.
We could make loads of dough.
Well, they're all doing it, you know.
Cher. Céline Dion.
Elton John.
If you want money
from me, Dad, just ask.
I don't want your
fucking money, do I?
I just want to help your fucking career,
don't I?
My career don't need help.
Really?
Your last record,
you know how many it sold?
Don't need help?
You sure fucking do.
So you know the precise sales
figures for me last album.
When was me birthday?
Surprise me. Now, look, look...
When was me birthday?
Aldy, Aldy, Aldy!
You never would have
made it without me.
I did make it without you.
I made it in spite of you.
You inherited all your musical talent from me!
I wrote all your songs
from the tip of my cock.
Right. That's it. So, like,
I've been plagiarizing from your ball bag.
Where does the DNA come...
Where does your talent come from?
Here.
Brilliant bit of biology, Dad.
Yeah, I think that's what Darwin
discovered on the Galapagos Isles.
That music can be written
in someone's spunk.
I'm talking fucking facts.
I think I've just been raped.
- What's that?
Raped?
Here you go, mate.
That'll take the edge off.
Yeah, give him that.
Make yourself useful.
Here you go. All right?
What is this?
It's called a Jeffrey, Aaron.
Bit of this, bit of that.
Here. Have a look.
Have a look at this.
Aldous Snow wasn't always so pretty,
was he, eh?
What are you showing him
that for, Dad?
Why do you carry
that photograph?
Remember when
we used to box?
You used to get in the ring,
wheezing around.
Do you remember?
Hey, what's in this?
My heart's starting to beat really fast.
It's weed mostly.
Sergio gave it to me.
It's got a bit of opium in it.
Some heroin.
Crunched-up E's.
- Clorox.
Methadone. Subutex.
Morphine. Peyote.
Some other stuff
that's unidentifiable,
and I think a little bit of angel dust, actually,
if I'm not mistaken.
You know, bit of glue for... Yeah.
Keep it traditional.
It's like a drug Neapolitan.
Oh, my God,
look at his little boat.
What a lovely
little boat race.
Yeah, let me get a shot of that.
Hold it, hold it. Cheese!
I'll never tire of
looking at that git.
Why the fuck is it
called a Jeffrey?
'Cause who could be
scared of a Jeffrey?
Yeah, Jeffrey's just this nice bloke
from down the road, isn't he?
What's wrong with you?
"Hello, I'm Jeffrey!
I've just moved in."
"Yes, I'm Jeffrey."
"Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey."
"My wife has got varicose veins!"
I'm having a heart attack.
I'm having a heart attack.
You're not having
a heart attack, Aaron.
I think he might be
having a heart attack.
He's not. He's all right.
Oh, no.
Don't wind him up.
I'm having
a heart attack.
He is.
He's having a heart attack.
I'm telling you.
Listen to your dad! He's right!
He's not having
a heart attack.
He looks like he's having a heart attack,
doesn't he?
Aaron, come with me, mate.
Just get away from him.
He's an idiot.
It's all right.
Just take deep breaths.
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.
That's what you need to do.
Come here. We're together,
mate, all right?
I shouldn't have given you the Jeffrey.
That was a mistake.
I'm so sorry. But relax now.
It's over. Everything is beautiful.
The world is beautiful. Everything is cool.
Look around us, we're...
Look at that, look.
Look at these.
Look at this tiny,
simple beauty of this tiny little ant.
Isn't that lovely? See?
We're at one with that. So lovely.
It's nice, beautiful.
Isn't it beautiful?
And lovely, and wonderful,
and pure and...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.
No.
I'm on the Jeffrey, too.
Now just breathe deeply.
Okay.
Okay.
That won't last. No.
That's the joy of
the Jeffrey, you see.
It goes away,
but then it comes back!
Don't worry. It doesn't do that.
You're gonna be okay.
Don't listen to him,
don't listen to him.
Here. Put your hand here.
Just touch the furry wall.
Stay with me. Be calm. Be calm.
Just stroke the furry wall.
You're with the furry wall.
With the furry wall now.
Dad!
Stop bullying my mate!
You sound
just like your mum.
Don't talk about my mum.
Y'all need to take a hit of this Jeffrey!
It'll calm you down!
Sammy's right!
Right, I've got a question.
She still seeing that soft-dick postman, eh?
Or has he left her as well?
You're gonna die on
your own, old man.
You're gonna die and I'm gonna fucking
laugh when you die, you old cunt.
Aaron, stop stroking the furry wall!
We're going...
Get off!
Hey, shouldn't
somebody stop this?
Feel how good this feels?
I'm gonna cover the whole outside
of my house in this material.
Come back here.
Get back here. Get...
My house is gonna look
like a fucking werewolf.
What the fuck?
Go on, run away!
Stop chasing me!
See, Aaron?
The plan is working.
This is what old pussy used
to look like in the '70s.
I miss that.
You're a very bad parent!
I'll show you bad, eh?
What are you doing?
That's a gun!
He's got a gun!
Now that's what I'm talking about.
Oh, no.
Where did that come from?
Hey!
Keep stroking the wall!
Keep stroking the wall!
That's Jeffrey's gun.
No one endangers my artist!
Somebody help me, please!
I'm coming, Aaron!
This is so rock star.
I'm having a heart attack!
Somebody take me to the hospital!
It's on North Casino Way!
Calm down.
I'm having a heart attack!
You're having a heart attack,
are you? I am!
Jesus!
Why can't everything be this simple?
Sergio, fancy a drink, eh?
Sergio would have made you
bring a medical kit.
Where is the medical kit
that Sergio...
It's over there!
It's over there!
Fucker.
Yeah!
I'm okay.
Right!
Come here!
No! No. No.
Now I'm gonna stab you in the
heart with this adrenaline needle.
What? What?
I'm alive!
See if you like this.
Where the hell you been?
We went to see Cher.
Cher? How was it?
Amazing.
This is all your fault!
He's fucking Catwoman!
You're so mean!
That's enough!
It's not easy
being a parent.
Shit!
I'm sorry, pops,
you okay?
Now, this is what the
music industry is all about.
Sergio's gone crazy.
I love this game!
He's Jeffreyed.
Let's go! Bye!
No, I don't think so.
This adrenaline's crazy!
I've never run so fast in my life!
I don't have my luggage!
Fuck your luggage!
We'll get you new luggage!
Where you going?
Run all the way back to LA!
Sergio is chasing us!
This is the longest
hallway of all time!
It's Kubrickian!
You cannot outrun me!
I am black!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Please, driver! Just drive it!
Go! Now! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Drive!
Drive faster!
Quickly!
It's not fucking cool!
Go! Oh, no!
Oh, my God! Oh!
Stop, stop!
Stop!
Why aren't you bitches going?
Come on!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go! Go!
The plan worked!
Now that's a mind fuck.
Aldous? Aldous.
Aldous, I can't sleep.
The adrenaline'll wear off soon, Aaron.
Just be patient.
Go back to sleep.
I can't sleep, man.
This adrenaline is just...
It's like coursing through my whole body!
Aaron, don't be selfish.
I'm really tired.
I've had a really
difficult few days.
Been under a lot of pressure.
Just let me relax.
No! No!
Aaron,
you're being strange.
No! Aaron, don't be selfish.
I'm sleeping.
No! You've kept me up for three days,
you got me all Jeffreyed up,
and you stabbed me in the arm
with an adrenaline needle!
You're staying up
and talking to me!
I gave you that adrenaline
for your own good.
Your life was in jeopardy.
I'm like a guardian angel.
Your dad. Your dad, man.
That sucks.
That was crazy, man.
He's all right.
He's just trying to live his life, isn't he?
He's not all right. He uses you.
You let people use you.
Sooner or later you're
gonna be all used up!
Yeah, a lot of the time
when people are on drugs,
they come up with sentimental rubbish.
But this is brilliant.
Ha, ha. I know you're making fun of me,
but I don't care.
No, you've made me happy.
Just let me sleep now.
You know what I'm gonna do
when I get home?
No, this is good.
I'm gonna get on
my hands and knees,
and I'm gonna beg
Daphne to take me back.
It's gonna be shameful.
But that's what you should do.
Because Jackie
is your Daphne!
I think it's a bit more
complicated than that, mate.
No. Underneath that hair is a
brain and a heart just like mine.
No, I think your brain
is full of lollipops
and rainbows and
cheese and wonder.
Mine's slightly darker.
Aaron, you seem very tense.
Stop it. Aaron!
You're growling. I don't like your spasm.
You're being strange.
Stop it. Stop it.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Thank you.
You okay?
Yeah. Sorry. I'm just...
I'm just really tired.
Just get some sleep, Aaron.
Go home and sleep, mate, all right?
Okay, good. 'Cause if I don't get some sleep,
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Go home.
I'm cool.
I'm just gonna be here.
I'm just gonna rest,
prepare, you know.
Prepare for the show.
See you in a few hours.
Good morning, beautiful.
Fancy an orgasm?
'Cause I knock them out, like, for free.
I told you not to come here.
It just happened.
Get in here, Aldous.
Don't be so violent.
I gotta stop now.
We're done.
All right.
Hey. Steady! That's not fair.
I haven't finished.
I got a busy day!
What, you want to have a wank and
then just rub my tits or something?
No, I don't want to.
Please?
I'm not 12.
Please?
I don't want to rub
your tits and wank.
I'll tell you a sexy story.
Jackie!
Darling.
That's not fair. That's not equal.
Reason within.
What about a BJ?
Just a quick one.
Will you do
my balls as well?
Yeah, fuck, all right.
Will you put your fingers
up my bottom?
All right, yeah. Later.
What are you even doing here, Aldous?
Why are you in LA?
I'm here because I've been thinking
about you the last few days.
I want to be with you, Jackie.
I know that now.
You on a Jeffrey?
Yeah.
I'm not partying anymore.
I'm in a clean zone.
I have been for a while.
Well, that's perfect,
because...
I'm actually
a different person.
A very different person.
I want to be clean with you.
You're the love of my life.
Aldous, I've been
doing kabbalah.
It's an ancient religion. It's brought to
light all the mistakes that I've made.
For all those mistakes,
I am sorry.
Don't be sorry.
Let's get married.
I love you.
Yeah, and I was
going to get married,
but then you went to rehab
for methamphetamine,
I was taking a lot of E,
and we had to reschedule.
Come off,
'cause that's not important.
Aldous!
This has been the best four months of my life.
I've realized you aren't capable of happiness.
It's why your
music's so shit.
It's been years since I've seen
you laugh or cry in a real way.
You just numb
yourself with drugs.
I was clean for
seven years...
And you did yoga for
five fucking hours a day!
That's mental.
There's nothing in this world
that you can't
turn into heroin.
The other day Lars
cried for three hours.
Bit indulgent.
It was beautiful!
And cleansing!
And more intimate than anything
you and I have ever shared.
We share a son. That is a bit more
intimate than a crying drummer.
Naples is not your son.
Yes, he is.
Yes, he... Jackie, why...
Don't say things like
that in an argument,
'cause, like, you can't come back from that.
That's horrible.
He's not. Do you remember
that photographer, Fernando?
Do you remember when
Fernando and I went
and spent that month
together in Naples?
I'm so sorry, Aldous.
I was 19 at the time,
and I was so
in love with you,
and I thought you would
break it off with me,
and then you turned out
to be such a good father.
And then he just kept looking
more and more Italian.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so glad we finally got to
have this conversation, darling.
<i>Namaste.</i>
This is not an appropriate time to say <i>namaste.</i>
Yeah.
Naples?
Yeah?
One day you'll have to
find a wife or a partner.
Yeah, I know that.
Don't choose a woman
like your mother.
What do you mean?
I mean, your mother is
a wonderful mother,
but she is
a terrible human being.
Are you sure of that?
Well, yeah, because if she
wasn't terrible, Naples,
why would she have
torn my heart up?
Why are you so moody today?
I'm not moody. I'm just...
I'm all right.
Do you love me?
I do love you, Dad.
I do love you, Aldous.
Why do I have to
call you Aldous?
You are my dad.
Aldous.
Dad.
Aldous.
Dad. All right.
I'll see you later.
See you tomorrow, Dad.
Good boy.
You gonna be okay, Aldous?
Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine.
I'll forget that the last seven
years has happened.
Aldous!
Hello. <i>Enter Sandman.</i>
Babe? We should
really get back to Naples.
He's waiting
back there for us.
So why don't you go and sue Napster,
you little Danish twat?
<i>Aaron!
This is Sergio! Where the fuck are you guys?</i>
<i>And why the fuck aren't you</i>
<i>answering your phone?</i>
<i>I'm answering my phone,</i>
<i>and I just got hit by a motherfucking car!</i>
<i>Answer your...</i>
Hi. Before you say anything
just let me talk, okay?
You were right.
We broke off our relationship
without really thinking about it.
And I've learned
over the past few days
that life is mainly filled with
superficial surface encounters.
And I realize now how wonderful it is,
what we have.
I'm begging you to take me back.
I'm sorry.
Did you hook up with anyone
while you were gone?
You mean
surface encounters?
What is he
doing here?
What the fuck
is he doing here?
I'll get rid of him, all right?
Did you invite him?
Hey, man.
What are you doing here?
Just went and saw Jackie.
She's marrying
Lars Ulrich now,
and Naples ain't
really my son.
I remember thinking,
"What bad advice."
Thank you, Aaron.
So, this is
what you live in.
You're Daphne then?
Dr. Daphne?
You know, when you hear about
someone and then you meet them?
That's happening now.
I've walked in the middle
of a romantic reconciliation?
No.
No, no, no.
Definitely not.
Why is it so tense?
Is it because he had sex with other
people when he was working with me?
I think that's
something we should...
We're gonna
discuss privately.
No, I think I'd like
to discuss it now.
Yes. I would like to talk about it.
I am upset. I am pissed.
Why are you
so cross, Daphne?
Because he broke my trust.
We were barely
broken up for a day
and he went and
cheated on me.
I didn't enjoy it, okay?
What I think, Daph,
is that human beings
by their nature
are polygamous.
It's against nature to be with one person.
It never works.
Yeah.
Or you think it's working,
and then it turns out
he's cheating on you
with a bunch of
hos and skanks.
I personally think that monogamy can
work given the right circumstance.
Aaron, why have you chosen to put
yourself in this ideological prison?
You don't need these
unnecessary restrictions.
Unless you get rid of them,
you just can't progress.
What kind of
sexual restrictions?
'Cause in nature,
there's everything
from polygamy to,
like, a threesome.
What...
Threesome.
Well, I mean, a threesome is
something that's possible right now.
You know,
the three of us could have a threesome.
Hypothetically.
We've got the utensils.
There's three of us.
Okay, that's funny.
Yeah, we're gonna
do a threesome.
Let's just get naked
and start fucking right here.
We should do it.
We should have a threesome.
Wait, what?
I don't... What?
Come on.
Let's have a threesome.
No, thanks. I don't...
I'm all right, thank you.
So you get to mess
around on the road,
and because I'm a woman,
I don't get to have any fun?
You had your turn.
It's my turn now.
I would like to have
a threesome, please.
Don't think of it
as a threesome.
Think of it as having
sex with your girlfriend
while someone else also
has sex with your girlfriend.
I think it'd be fun.
We should do a threesome.
What are you doing?
We are pre-negotiating
a threesome.
Pre-negotiated.
And agreed upon.
I'm fucking psyched!
So, Aaron, Daphne,
shall we play doctor?
I'm not sucking his dick,
that's like 100%.
Just relax.
Just relax and listen to Mariah.
That's good.
Aaron, look at her.
Aaron, look at Daphne.
Put those strawberries down.
They're not for you.
Come on, mate, don't be tight.
We share everything now.
Okay, I'm gonna kiss
Aldous now, okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
Is that okay?
Yeah, it's totally cool.
Okay. Great.
Oh, my God!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, my God!
Daphne?
Yeah?
Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
You sure you want to do this?
Fuck!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Aaron, no.
What?
What are you doing?
I'm just having a threesome!
I'm just having fun!
Come on!
Enough with these rules and restrictions, right?
Come on!
Unleash that!
This is the emperor! Release him!
Aaron, don't do that!
You need to
look at yourselves.
Honestly, this isn't
how people live.
What the fuck
are we doing?
I don't know.
What are we doing?
I don't want to do this.
I don't want this, either.
Like, at all.
I am so sorry, Aaron.
How did this happen?
You kind of insisted,
but whatever.
Wow. That was insane.
What was I thinking?
I think I've misjudged the dynamic.
You've been wonderful hosts.
Particularly you.
Oh, God, I'm on call.
Jesus Christ.
Nothing you say makes any sense!
Okay? I understand that now.
You're just
a fucking junkie.
And you're smart,
so you make your insanity sound good,
but it's bullshit.
This is it, Aaron.
This is rock and roll.
Did you enjoy the party?
You're sick in
the fucking head!
You messed your own life up and
now you have to mess up mine, too?
We're done here?
Get out of my apartment.
Thanks for the hospitality.
Bye.
Where are my boxers?
So I might not
do the Greek.
You know, the show at the Greek.
The concert.
<i>I might not do it.</i>
Oh, dear.
That's a shame.
Can you say something
reassuring to me?
Say that reassuring thing
that mums say to their son?
<i>You... No, you...</i>
You stay chipper.
And don't get down.
And when you get back,
I'll make you some shortbread or...
All right, well,
I think everything's gonna be all right.
Anyway, I just wanted you to
know that I love you, Mum.
<i>Stay chipper.</i>
<i>All right, darling? Bye-bye.</i>
<i>Coming up later...</i>
<i>The 10-year anniversary of Aldous</i>
<i>Snow's seminal concert at the Greek.</i>
<i>Live in Los Angeles. But now,</i>
Bill Maher, Red, White and Spew.
<i>"Where the fuc</i>k <i>are you?
I am gonna kill you</i>. <i>Smiley face."</i>
Fuck him.
<i>Broadcasting</i>
<i>live from the Greek,</i>
<i>your Uncle Joe.</i>
<i>The crowd is amped!</i>
<i>Aldous Snow,</i>
<i>the most self-destructive man in rock and roll,</i>
<i>not yet in the building.</i>
<i>Well, there'll be</i>
<i>a lot of Infant Sorrow...</i>
<i>Aaron? It's me.</i>
<i>I really need to</i>
<i>apologize and to tell you</i>
<i>that I'm gonna jump off the roof</i>
<i>of the Standard Hotel now.</i>
Fuck him.
<i>If you're not busy...</i>
Shit, shit, shit, shit.
Hello, Los Angeles!
Should I jump
into the pool?
Or how about
into the street?
Hey, Aldous, it's Aaron! Get down!
I'm here! I'm here, get down from there!
Hey, Aldous, I'm here! Hey!
Hey, Aldous, don't jump!
Hi, Aaron!
Just come down and
we'll talk about it!
You made it!
No, stop!
- He's gonna jump!
- Don't do it! No, stop!
No, no, no! No, no, no!
Aldous! Aldous!
My arm.
Aaron.
Are you okay, man?
You...
Aaron, it was
wrong of me to have sex
with you and
your girlfriend, Daphne.
That wasn't fair.
No, no, that's okay.
We don't have to talk about it.
I done it for me.
I done it for my
selfish reasons.
I know, but fine.
Whatever. Just...
I don't wanna...
Are you okay?
I'm Ionely, mate.
I'm really Ionely.
And I'm sad. And I ain't got no one,
except my mum.
And she's an idiot.
And now I'm crying
in front of you,
and you thought
I was cool, didn't you,
for a while, and now I'm crying.
I'm embarrassed.
Embarrassed.
You try so hard, man.
But you're fine.
You're Aldous Snow, man.
You make people happy
by doing what you love to do.
And that's fucking awesome.
There's thousands of
people in a room right now
just standing,
waiting to see your face.
And they like you.
I liked you before I met you.
Don't you like me no more?
Aldous, I came here.
I'm here.
Right. I want to do the gig.
I'm gonna... I'll do the gig.
I'm gonna do it.
No, I didn't mean that.
I don't think that we...
Let's go.
We shouldn't go.
No, we should do it.
I don't want to let people down who love me.
Not tonight.
Let's go. Let's do it.
I'm pretty sure if you don't go to a hospital,
you're going to die.
I want to go to the Greek Theatre
and I want to save your job,
and I want to
perform for my fans
and do something
that ain't selfish,
'cause this is not working
for me as a lifestyle choice.
You sure you're okay?
'Cause it looks like Jaws just bit your ass off.
Yeah. Little bit of blood
makes a really big cloud.
This is a bad idea.
We should not be doing this.
Yes, we should.
This is a good idea.
Although, my arm is
hurting a little bit.
I sustained an injury.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
That's bone.
I'm taking you to the hospital, Aldous.
I'm taking you to the hospital,
all right, man?
Not tonight. This is
rock and roll. Touch it.
That is so fucking...
Don't overreact.
I fucking threw up.
I told you
don't freak out.
Get that fucking arm out of my face!
I fucking threw up!
Yes, yes, yes!
I knew you would make it. I love you!
Sergio.
Shit!
No! We should take him
to the hospital.
No. Come on,
let's get him into wardrobe.
Don't worry about it.
Let's get him out to the audience there.
The audience is
getting restless,
but you're here.
You are here.
Hey, look, we should talk.
What's up?
He's like, really, really hurt.
What are you talking about?
He's here.
He's all right.
It's just a little scratch.
There's a teeny-weeny
bone sticking out!
He can't go on.
What the fuck? Hold on.
We have something for that.
Give him two of these.
He'll be singing like Aretha Franklin.
I can't do this anymore.
What the fuck you talking about,
you can't do it anymore?
You, you got him here!
You've done it!
He doesn't need to be pushed
on the stage right now. I...
Sometimes we gotta
sacrifice one lamb, baby.
It's gonna be all right.
He's not gonna die!
You keep feeding
him drugs and lies.
He's a sad guy.
He needs help.
He's gonna live a long time.
Trust me.
British motherfuckers
don't die.
You ever heard of a fucking...
A British rock and roll star dying?
No, none of them die.
Mick Jagger. Keith Richards.
Those Led Zeppelin...
Them motherfuckers old as fuck!
Fucking Ozzy Osbourne's
gonna outlive Miley Cyrus!
I quit.
Hey, come on!
Why do you even have me feeling like this?
This is supposed
to be fun!
I fucking quit.
Aaron, get back here!
Aldous! You don't
have to go out there.
You don't have to
do this anymore!
I don't know what all the fuss was about.
I love doing this!
You don't have to do this.
I do, Aaron.
They're all here to see me.
I feel nervous.
It's good to
feel something.
I love this!
It's all I've got. And you.
I owe you one, mate.
See you on the other side.

We slept for, like, 14 hours.
Wow. I feel
so much better now.
Me, too.
Do you want to
get some brunch?
We should probably burn
these sheets, huh?
Yeah. I can get some bleach
from the hospital.
Maybe just torch the whole apartment.
You got it?
Yeah.
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>
<i>You sound sarcastic now. Cheers, cheers.</i>

<i>Yes.</i>
<i>We have</i>

<i>He's my producer.</i>
<i>He's got a label.</i>
How are you?

<i>Is this 'cause</i>

<i>You think, "Oh, I'm grunge."</i>
<i>Is that what it is?</i>
<i>You look like a lesbian.</i>
Sing the song.
<i>Sit down, Aaron.</i>
Thank you.

<i>Round of applause.</i>
<i>All right.</i>
<i>But also here is my lad.</i>
<i>You all right, sunshine?</i>
<i>Naples is here. You all right, mate?</i>
I'm fine, Daddy.
<i>Yeah. See,</i>
<i>he still calls me daddy.</i>
<i>He was my son for a while,</i>
<i>but due to my complicated sex life,</i>
<i>it turns out it's best just to think</i>
<i>of him as a tiny associate.</i>
<i>Also, also he's quite mature.</i>
<i>He's more mature than me.</i>
<i>Do you love me?</i>
Uh, yeah.
<i>Don't think that long!</i>
<i>It doesn't mean anything!</i>
<i>See, that's the thing now,</i>
