Why are you looking at me
like that?
Go and play with your friends,
instead of clinging
to my apron strings like a girl.
Or are you a girl, now?
Rosetta...
Rosetta, what are you doing, love?
Hurry up, darling.
You still here?
Here's a thousand lire,
go buy yourself an ice-cream.
Go on, take it!
Angel of God thou art my guardian
angel. Help and guide me...
who was given into your care
by the Grace of God...
You've got it all wrong!
I'm one of the girl's relatives!
Let me go! I ain't done nothing!
What are they going to do to me?
Let go of me! I ain't done nothing!
I got two kids to look after!
Criaco isn't here yet
and the train's about to leave.
You explained it all clearly
to him, didn't you?
He could easily get
on the wrong train.
Oh, they're both
sitting in the compartment,
I can see there from here!
I don't know, it's Thursday isn't?
Well, he's got a class tonight.
Here he is at last!
It's okay, thanks!
Criaco, you're too much!
- I forgot my book.
- He forgot his book...
So I can study on the train.
I had it all worked out.
Why are you changing
into civilian clothes?
Regulations!
Kids are scared by the uniform,
right?
You better change,
and change your face, too...
if you can!
Why didn't they get
a Social Worker?
How should I know?
When nobody else wants the job...
they give it to the Carabinieri.
How old is the little girl?
Eleven?
Yes, she's eleven.
And she's been a prostitute
for two years!
Cologne! Is that regulations too?
Will you do me a favour?
You're my friend aren't you?
Your colleague.
I've got some urgent business
in Bologna,
so I'll leave you to take the kids
to the Children's Home.
You're out of your mind!
When you arrive take them straight
to the Home...
then call me at the number
I've given you.
If I'm not there, tell them
when your train arrives
and we'll meet here
at the station by the plaque!
What plaque?
- The memorial plaque!
- Are you sure you'll...
Don't worry!
Try to get some sleep!
And get out of that uniform,
Criaco!
You're a real friend, thanks!
Have a nice trip!
I've got some rolls for you too,
are you hungry?
What's in 'em?
Salami and cheese.
I don't like it. You should've got
a bottle of water.
What's happened to the other cop?
Have you had a fight?
He's not a cop,
he's a Carabiniere.
Same thing!
No, it's not the same thing!
Is that where you keep
your revolver?
That's none of your business!
Why don't you go to sleep?
Are we there?
Can't you see we are?
I'm hungry!
So have something to eat.
I want one of those with cream,
coffee with milk and a coke!
Don't you want anything to eat?
Hey! I'm talking to you!
Where are you going?
Where do you think you're going?
What's the matter
with your brother?
He hasn't eaten since yesterday,
he lives on air.
Go ask him if he wants something.
A thousand lire.
There was a coffee with milk,
a bun and coke...
And for me a roll and a coffee.
We've got to go
to the Children's Home; is it far
or can we walk?
Did you buy these?
Where did you get the money?
Mom said I could keep it...
You can't have pocket money,
you're too stupid and sick!
Stop that! What do you think
you're doing?
You, sit over there!
What's the matter with you?
I won't let you get away with it!
What are you crying for?
He hurt my eye.
Let me see...
Are you crazy?
That's nothing.
Will they put us
in the same room at the Home?
How should I know?
Stop crying, it's nothing.
He wants to kill me!
Don't talk nonsense.
Now be good, I've got to get you
there safe and sound.
Are you one of the family?
I'm a Carabiniere, their escort.
Why aren't you in uniform?
Do you have excursions here?
Wait in there, children...
You come with me.
I've handed over the kids
and the documents, can I go now?
It's not quite so simple...
It stinks like a hospital.
Remember when mom had her appendix
taken out?
Do you remember?
Are you prepared to take
the responsibility?
Well, I'm not! There's not even
a medical certificate!
I can't put that girl in
with the others!
She needs special care,
somebody to look after her.
I don't know who's responsible for
this mess, it certainly isn't me!
What are you doing here?
Go and wait with your sister.
I'll make a phone call
and see if I can sort this out.
Those kids would be like fish
out of water here.
I see that they're Sicilians...
One thing's certain,
they can't stay here,
for their own good
and that of everybody else!
Life...
must be lived...
like a gift.
Have you got that far?
To be discovered...
and used the full. Period.
Letting one's self go...
Comma.
Living from...
day to day...
without...
a plan. Comma.
I saw a little fish
with a bad cold,
sick in polluted water,
but there was no room
at the fish hospital.
Asphalt and cement!
Get rid of all that!
Are you a boy or a girl?
A girl!
Where's your brother?
It's not my job
to look after him!
What are you doing?
I'm tired of waiting.
When do I get my room?
I want to have a wash.
They're getting it ready now.
Will I be by myself?
Yes, I told them.
I'm hungry too!
They'll take you
to the dining hall soon...
but I have to leave.
OK! So leave.
Maybe I'll come back later...
to see if you've been good.
Well, see you later...
You'd better not let them see
you doing that.
They won't take them, see?
What do you mean?
The kids, of course.
He says there's
a medical certificate missing.
But it's just an excuse,
they don't want the little girl.
I'll have to take them
somewhere else.
What do you mean,
what's the difference?
If you were here we could call
the Company Commander.
What can I do, all on my own
in a call-box?
I haven't even got a place
to sleep!
What? With the pennies
I've got left?
No, listen... You can't do
anything from Bologna,
take the first train
and be here tomorrow morning.
If anything happens you'll be
deeper in the shit than me!
OK. Do what the fuck you like!
What can they learn here?
The teacher's a nun!
A wooly-minded nun!
Here! Slip this into your pocket,
no one's looking!
Okay, then I'll keep it!
Where are they taking us?
Who cares? As long as
we get out of here!
Why wouldn't they take us?
Maybe because of me.
We shouldn't be here anyway,
this is for orphans.
Here they are.
Are you ready?
Let's go!
We've got to get out of here!
I didn't get a room to myself...
I was with a nun who snored.
I didn't get a wink of sleep!
Neither did I!
- Is that St. Peter's?
- Yes.
Dummy! It's too small
for St. Peter's!
Haven't you seen it on TV?
Get going!
Have we got to catch another train?
Where are we going?
I've got to take you to Sicily.
Did you hear that?
We're born in Sicily.
Would you carry my bag?
Are you tired?
Wait for me here.
I'm going to buy something...
and keep an eye on the cases,
because here...
Is the station far from here?
- What station?
- The train station?
The main station?
Just around the corner.
Give me two orangeades
and two hamburgers.
The lady! The lady!
Find the lady!
The last round! Here she is!
Very smart! I say it's this one...
let's see them all!
This is the winner.
Who'll try their luck?
Once more and then we stop.
You'd better eat something.
What's so interesting
about that trickster?
Have you got money to throw away?
They should be in jail.
Why? What harm are they doing?
They're worse than thieves!
Criminals...
Better off without them!
You don't understand a thing!
But you understand everything!
Get a move on!
Come on, hurry it up!
Move it!
I'll help you!
Get going!
We mustn't miss the train.
Hurry up! I haven't got
the tickets yet!
These things always happen to me!
Move it! Now what's the matter?
Wait!
What is it?
Do you feel bad?
What's wrong with your brother?
You got a belly-ache?
You don't breathe... get up!
- Give him this, that'll stop it.
- What do I do with it?
Is he sick?
Go on, take a deep breath.
Stand up! Now we'll get you
to the train and you'll be okay.
Trains upset him.
He needs rest...
Oh, shit!
Now what do I do?
And who might you be?
Rosetta Scovella.
We're being taken
to a Children's Home.
The Carabiniere's in there
and my brother's asleep.
Hey, what are you doing there?
That's my bed, you know!
That's okay, don't move.
Do you feel bad?
What's the matter with you?
Asthma.
What?
Asthma.
You can't breathe?
And they brought you here?
Here it's better you don't breathe!
I'm an Inter supporter.
Inter? The Milanese soccer team?
Now I know why you feel bad!
Everything all right?
Sure, everything's okay!
What have the kids been doing
pilfering?
I'll explain later.
I want to sleep in my own bed,
tonight.
Does my being here bother you?
My house is your house.
I was lucky to find you...
Where else could I have gone
with these two?
What are you going to do, now?
I'm sure I don't know.
They need a Social Worker,
it's a woman's job.
If I were you I'd call
my superior officers...
and wash my hands of it!
Then my hands would be tied.
Do you like that?
Not bad, eh?
Haven't you got a radio?
I left it at home.
Do you like pop-singers?
Do you like Prince?
And Ramazzotti?
And Vasco Rossi?
Do you like Vasco Rossi?
Breathe softly,
don't make a sound...
sleep now, waking when
morning comes round...
I like Nino D'Angelo best.
Holy Mary! Nino D'Angelo!
Are those your tapes?
Would you give me one?
Go on, choose any one you like.
Come on!
Don't hang back!
Come and get it!
It's always hurry, hurry, hurry.
And now we have to wait.
There's ham rools,
orangeade and cookies.
Do you want to eat?
I'll leave them here...
- You didn't eat anything!
- I got to go to the toilet!
Sit down! You can go later.
You really scared me today...
Do you know why you get sick?
Because you don't eat anything.
You must eat...
or you'll always be sick.
But if you eat you'll grow up
big and strong...
And you won't be sick anymore.
And if the big guys bother you...
You can give them a sock
on the jaw and fix 'em!
Your sister! Stay there!
Engaged!
Hurry up!
Can't you read
what's written there?
Haven't you finished yet?
Come on, let's go!
- I want to brush my teeth...
- You can do that on the train.
The train rocks too much.
What are you looking at?
These are ladies' toilets
you shouldn't be here at all!
If they catch you...
So what?
Go on, brush your teeth.
See what nice,
straight teeth I've got?
They used to be crooked...
then Mom bought me a brace.
It cost over a million lire!
But now, d'you know
what they say to me?
What a lovely mouth you've got!
Who tells you things like that?
I certainly don't!
If your Mom had thought of your
good instead of your looks,
you wouldn't be here now!
Where are you going?
The waiting room's that way!
Leave me alone!
Who do you think you are?
Listen!
Leave me alone!
Stop it!
Back to the waiting room
to get your brother,
then we catch the train.
Take your hands off me!
Wake up.
The train's here.
Have you calmed down?
When we get to
the Children's Home,
I'll tell them what you did to me.
What did I do?
I know!
What do you know?
I'll tell them that you felt me!
Do you take me for a fool?
Now behave, you'll be better off,
in the end.
Go on, hit me!
The more you mark me,
the worse it'll be for you.
I'm thirsty.
Did you buy any water?
Yes.
Where is it?
It's finished.
Are there any cookies left?
If there are, they're in the bag.
- May I get them?
- Yes.
I said you could get them.
How long before we arrive?
Four or five hours.
We have to change train first.
When this trip's over
do you go back to Milan?
Yes.
What a journey they've given you.
And all for nothing.
They didn't want me
at the first Children's Home
and they won't want me
down here either.
They won't want me anywhere!
The restaurant is closed
for a communion party.
Don't you recognise me?
You're the one who's grown, not me.
Uncle!
- Where's your mother?
- Over there.
Where's your uniform?
- In here.
You turn up like this...
without any warning!
We're celebrating a communion.
Sutveyor Papaleo,
this is my brother!
Have you taken
your first communion?
Have you learnt your catechism?
Who created us?
God created us.
Who is God?
God is the perfect being,
creator...
and Lord of Heaven and Earth.
But you don't know
the Guardian Angel prayer.
You haven't taken
your first communion yet.
When we get to the Children's Home
I'll tell them,
otherwise you'll go to hell.
Now we can serve 300 covers,
weddings, communions, christenings.
What about the kids?
Are they a colleague's children?
They... Yes, they're
my Sergeant-Major's kids.
Say "Hello" to my sister.
- How old are they?
- Eleven and nine.
Come upstairs, you can freshen up.
- Have you been to Calabria before?
- This is the first time.
I'm taking them from Milan
to Sicily, where they live.
They were visiting their father.
Sorry to take you through the
kitchen, but it is the only way.
As you can see, it's all new.
My brother!
He's a Carabiniere in Milan!
I haven't seen him for two years!
Carmelo! Wait for me,
we'll have a chat.
Please excuse the mess,
the house isn't finished yet.
I never bring anybody up here,
I'm too ashamed.
I'm not anybody, I'm family!
If you'd warned me,
I could've fixed up the kids.
What will they think?
What will the girl tell her father
if I receive them like this?
But all the money
went into the restaurant,
and we're camping here
like Albanians, maybe worse!
Well, that's how it is.
But I'll make it
into the home I want.
And we'll build another floor,
for when you get married.
I'll get you a clean towel.
Now where did I put them?
I even bought the furniture,
I've paid a deposit and they'll be
delivered when I pay the rest.
Where are those towels?
Here, maybe...
Thanks to the kids,
we get to see you.
You're staying the night,
aren't you?
The kids can stay
with Papaleo the Sutveyor.
He's built himself a lovely villa
near here.
You can go to Aunt Concetta,
she often asks after you.
How's Granny?
She's eighty
and she's driving us all crazy.
Want to know the latest?
She thinks we're stealing
her pension.
It's terrible to get like that,
it would be better if God took her.
Ah, the towels at last...
This is the bathroom,
I hope you don't mind,
but at least it's clean.
I wish you'd warned me!
Don't worry,
it's as if they were family.
Call if you need me.
Why did you lie?
Lie?
Why did you say I'm
a sergeant-major's daughter?
Sergeant-majors are important
people aren't they?
I can wash here, they can see me!
Don't worry. I'll go out
and shut the door.
What are you doing?
Taking the air?
Having a rest?
It was a good idea to come here,
wasn't it?
We can have a wash and some food...
You must be hungry.
I'd like a house here,
there's a lovely view...
of the sea and the mountains.
My old village is over there.
Nobody lives there now,
they've all emigrated
or built houses here.
When I was your age, I walked
here everyday to go swimming.
Can you swim?
Ah, there she is...
I'm going down.
You come down a bit later,
and we'll eat.
Granny...
I wouldn't have recognised you.
How are you?
I'm always so tired...
You're a lot thinner.
How is everybody?
Things aren't so good.
Why? What's happened?
I'm always so tired...
But you've got thinner.
Do you eat enough?
I eat! I eat!
There's plenty of movement here,
but you've got your plants.
My flowers, yes...
But what about you?
Nothing, I'm a military man...
always in my black uniform.
I'm honest,
like you taught me to be.
That's the best way...
You still work, don't you?
I like it!
Keep still! Watch the birdie!
Good, one more, everybody smile!
Perfect!
How come I've never seen you
before?
I'm stationed in Milan, I only
come here about twice a year.
Before that I was at the school
in Rome.
May I go and sit
at the children's table?
Sure, have fun...
go and play with them.
What nice manners
those kids have.
You're too young
but you could be their father.
They aren't your children are they?
Of course...
and I've got four more in Milan.
You're a nice boy, don't joke
about things like that.
It's time you got married,
but you don't look as if
you're crazy about girl.
How do you know?
One day I'll give you a surprise...
Maybe he lives with a divorcee,
and these are her kids.
Could be...
Why do you keep your eyes
on them all the time?
Are you scared they'll run away?
Will you plait my hair?
Did you pass your exams?
Yes, and with top marks!
Where do you come from?
From Rome,
I've been to St. Peter's
and I've seen the Pope.
That little girl...
reminds me of someone...
Eat your food...
A doctor in these parts,
no names, you might arrest him.
Got invalid pensions
for half the village.
He helped a lot of people.
Then the reds held a demonstration
saying it's illegal.
Is hunger legal, then?
If there's a law,
it must be kept!
The law...
With all those swindles
in every political party?
Heavens! They're talking
politics again!
I'm leaving!
Besides...
your colleagues kept coming,
to close the job site,
for illegal building.
But if you've got the land
and want to build a house...
Building without a permit
is a crime.
How silly!
They'd never have
let us build here!
- Luckily, somebody helped us...
- I just don't want to know!
But I'm going to tell you!
Of course he knows...
In his job he sees things
in a different light.
When you leave the village,
you forget...
Look at this one,
it's my grandson.
And this is the old house
where I used to live...
and this...
is Antonio at five,
isn't he sweet?
This is a life line,
this is the line of luck,
and this is the line
of the evil eye,
this is the line of intelligence,
and this is the line of the heart.
No, you stay here...
So, you've been visiting
your father in Milan?
Yes.
Your father's stationed in Milan?
Yes.
And where do you live?
In the village with Mom.
- So, your parents are separated?
- No.
What does your mother do?
She's a school teacher.
Who told you to lie?
Your mother is in prison...
That's where I saw her face!
In this magazine.
What's going on?
Where are you going?
Come back here!
She's an idiot, don't take
any notice of her.
This is my home!
I'll throw her out!
I'll make her apologise.
You were having fun
with your friends...
Now we'll go back
and show her who we are.
That we don't give a damn for her.
That we despise her.
Let's go away.
Take us away from here.
Take us away.
When do we get there?
Ah, so you can talk.
When do we get there?
When it's time.
You let my sister twist
you around her finger.
She can turn on the tears
and get her way with anybody.
You'd better keep quiet.
Don't you ever cry?
Why should I cry?
I haven't done anything.
Neither has Rosetta.
You can't be held responsible,
you're just kids.
Where's your father?
Some father.
He makes babies
and then disappears.
Do you know him?
He used to live with us
when I was tiny...
then he left.
When I'm fifteen,
I'll go and find him...
and we'll go on a trip together.
What about your sister?
Who cares about her?
What's the matter with you?
You should look after your sister,
love each other,
who else will help you?
Come in, come on!
Do you want a call in the morning?
No, thank you.
Sort yourselves out,
you're asleep on your feet.
Here's some water
for the night.
You always get thirsty.
Open the window to change the air.
I'm sleeping next door.
Good night.
Not bad here, is it?
Open the window.
Why don't you go to bed?
Don't worry...
I won't run away.
Does the Children's Home
know about me?
Know what?
Have they seen that magazine?
I don't think so...
Has my brother seen it?
How could he?
I tore it up.
Where's that man, now?
In prison?
Sure, he's in prison.
Who was he?
A friend of your mother's?
He always said I was dirty,
but it wasn't true.
I wash myself everyday.
But he wanted to wash me again,
himself.
Don't go on!
Try to forget it,
you'll never see him again.
And Mom?
What'll happen to her?
She'll have to stand trial...
Maybe she'll get off lightly,
maybe she'll go free.
I keep dreaming that she dies.
Let me run away.
You must be crazy.
Pretend to be asleep
and I'll just leave.
Where would you go?
I don't know...
somewhere...
I'd be better off on my own.
That's all I need.
And what would happen to me?
You're a Carabiniere...
nothing would happen to you.
Get some rest,
that's the best thing.
We'll leave early tomorrow morning.
I'm thirsty.
Do you want a drink?
An orangeade?
A lemonade? A coke?
I want a glass of water...
and you?
Potato chips?
Potato chips!
She's always drifting off,
call her back.
Take this down...
I'll catch up with you.
We'll stop for ten minutes.
Get moving!
Give me a couple of chips.
Where is she going?
Let's leave her in peace,
she didn't sleep last night.
Nor did I.
Why?
Did you feel bad?
She never stopped crying.
The air is clean, here.
Sea air is good for asthma.
Breathe deeply!
Take good, deep breaths.
At the Children's Home
you'll be by the sea,
you'll have fun this summer.
You'll swim all you want.
I'm scared of the water.
Why?
I can't swim.
Go on!
Kick with your feet.
That's it!
It's cold!
Want to go for a swim?
Come on!
Put your arms around my neck.
Ready?
Let's go for a gallop!
I'm hungry!
Now, a Carabiniere goes
to the Grand Hotel
and says to the clerk...
"Show me a room, please".
"I've got to take down
all the information about it".
"What on earth for?"
Says the clerk.
Straight faced,
the Carabiniere replies:
"My sergeant told me to <i>book</i>
a room at the Grand Hotel".
Get it?
To "book" a room...
"Book" a room at the Grand Hotel...
You didn't get in...
Listen to this one, the same...
Carabiniere is on duty
at the Precinct House.
The Sarge calls him into the office
where there are some people.
"Take down this lady's particular,"
says the Sarge.
"I can do that, Sergeant,"
says the Carabiniere.
"Why not?" says the Sergeant.
"Not in front of these people,"
says the Carabiniere.
"I'm far too shy!"
Not bad, eh?
What are the lady's particulars?
Can't you guess?
Then what are you laughing for?
Hold on...
Come along!
We'll have something to eat.
You little devil.
I want a cutlet!
A cutlet? They serve fish, here!
- Give me some wine, please.
- No, you're too young.
Just a drop, with water.
All right, just a drop then.
How can you come to table
with those filthy hands?
Look!
No, please don't!
Pardon me!
Are they Americans?
Didn't you hear them speaking?
They're French.
I can speak French!
What?
Go on! Go and wash your hands.
I know a joke too...
All right, let's have it.
Why did the dog go
for the kitty-cat?
Go on, guess.
Hold on...
I don't know.
Because he likes pussy.
That's silly, dogs don't like cats.
No, he likes pussy!
He wants to make her!
Hey, youngster!
I made you laugh, eh?
Are they ever going
to bring us our fish?
Who's paying?
I invited you, so I pay.
Out of your own pocket,
or will they reimburse you?
What do you care?
I'm paying!
In Milan I could take you
to a great place.
Where is it?
Near our house,
it's called Burgy.
Burgy?
You eat French fries
and ketchup?
Have you been there?
Yes, one day we'll go there
together.
Is that a promise?
Don't go into the water,
you've only just eaten!
Antonio, will you give me
your address?
Do you want to send me
a post card?
Why not give it to me now?
No, you mustn't read it yet.
Give me the address.
Do you have to go to a school
to become a Carabiniere?
Of course, but it's a question
of luck, too.
They don't take just anybody.
Would they take me?
You're too young.
You've got to grow up
and get some muscles...
Besides, why be a Carabiniere?
Hi, what's your name?
Is he your father?
Impossible, he's too young.
In your car?
Yes, that one down there.
At what time?
Yes, it's here.
At four.
I wanted to be blond too.
I'm not blonde and I'd like
black hair, like yours.
When I grow up,
I'll be a hairdresser.
Me, big, do hair.
I've fixed it,
he'll take us by car.
According to tradition,
Noto was founded by the Sicani.
What are you doing?
Watch out, or you'll fall.
This church was built
after the earthquake.
Look how beautiful it is.
It's "Maroque".
I'm going to see the other things.
Whom do you like best?
They're both pretty.
But if you wanted to get engaged?
How you run on!
They'll be gone this evening
and we'll never see them again.
You can get their addresses.
What for?
They live so far away, in Paris.
Do you want our address?
Of course, I'll come and visit you.
All the way from Milan?
Who knows?
Maybe I'll be transferred.
I wouldn't mind being down here.
Then we'd be near each other.
Suppose they move me
to another Home?
I've taken you under my wing,
we'll keep in touch.
How many years must I stay
in the Home?
I don't know.
Until I'm fifteen?
Maybe.
When I'm fifteen I'll come to you,
wherever you are.
Press the button on the right,
that's it.
I'll pose now. Go on!
Press the button!
Go on, press the button!
The ace wins! The Lady wins!
Who'll beat me?
This one loses!
Who'll beat me?
The one in the middle.
You've won!
What game is this?
It's a very good game,
you have to find this card.
Not these this one.
Then you say: There!
Where did he learn that?
What did she say?
Yes, you can play.
Place your bets.
Move a bit...
Stop! Thief!
Get out of my way, you bastard!
Whore! What do you want from me?
I'll kill you!
One move and I'll ruin you!
Drop that knife!
Keep back, Luciano!
Drop you!
Screwed it up this time,
didn't you?
Stop it!
Antonio was great.
When the thief pulled out
his knife,
He stopped him right there!
Halt! Carabiniere!
You're shaking. Are you cold?
Scared?
I'm scared too.
I get scared every time
I go into a cop shop,
even for my passport.
I don't understand.
Sicily's lovely.
But it's all falling to bits.
You pig!
You've screwed yourself!
You're fucked!
Get away from here!
Go down there!
Is it OK?
You know, there's something else.
The Carabiniere should have taken
the kids to a Home, but he didn't.
I didn't understand all of it.
It's something about
child prostitution.
Her mother prostituted
the little girl!
Can you believe it? And she's only
eleven! It's atrocious.
Do you like my sun glasses?
Here! Take them as a present.
No, they're yours, keep them...
What did they say?
Prostitute...
Do you like being a Carabiniere?
It's a steady job...
and better than lots of others.
Besides, where can you find
other jobs?
And I like to be doing
something useful.
Are you thinking
of making it your career?
I've gone back to school
to get my diploma.
Waste of time, with your brain,
you won't make it.
Do you realise what this caper
will cost you?
What caper? I've arrested
an armed thief...
and immobilised him
without injury.
Who's talking about the thief?
I'm talking about the kids!
Kidnapping!
You must be joking!
Give me your warrant card.
Do you know what he's saying
to the old cop?
That he wants to keep me with him.
The little boy was sick,
he's got asthma.
That was three days ago.
What about yesterday and today?
Where did you spend the night?
I took them
to my sister's place,
so they could have
something to eat
and clean up.
I asked you where you spend
the night?
We stopped at an hotel.
Did you all sleep in the same room?
The girl as well?
What are you thinking of?
I put them in a room by themselves
and I slept next door.
But I didn't sleep all night.
And today you've been playing
at tourists.
The little girl...
wasn't well.
Is she sickly too?
You shouldn't be in the army!
You should be in the Red Cross.
In other words,
you did as you pleased.
I thought that...
You don't have to think,
you have to obey orders
and your orders are here,
in writing!
Then there's your colleague
who's gone absent without leave.
I'll have to inform your superiors.
Why did it take so long?
What did they say to you?
Where are we going now?
To the Children's Home.
Right now?
When else?
But it's late, maybe
they'll be closed.
Maybe they won't let us in.
They'll let you in...
Aren't you sleepy?
Shut your eyes?
What did the police say to you?
That's none of your business.
We'll stop for ten minutes.
Go to sleep.
We'll be there soon.
Maybe there'll be
a football field at the Home...
and they'll put you
in the team right away.
