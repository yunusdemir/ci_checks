<i>Previously on "Nashville"...</i>
- His parenting has nothing to do with...
- He has everything to do
- with that show, Daphne.
- He's sending me to boarding school.
Let go of him, Brad! Stop it!
Did you just assault me?
So when I call your name
please come join me here up front.
Daphne Conrad.
I went down there and saw
a completely different person.
Certainly wasn't Juliette.
I don't know what's wrong,
I can usually do more.
How much does Will hate me?
He doesn't hate you.
He's just sensitive right now.
Please welcome The Last Highways.
- Somebody, come on!
- Call 911!
We don't know.
Nobody's telling us anything.
They're running a bunch of
tests trying to figure it out.
Yeah.
_
Another mention.
The internet loves a good heart attack.
Wow. New record for crass.
Will would laugh. He likes puns.
Thanks. We'll keep you posted.
Okay.
Deacon sends his prayers.
Says if there's anything we need...
So, your friend has a serious infection.
But we've started him
on broad spectrum antibiotics
and he should improve quickly.
Infection? The EMTs thought
it was a heart attack.
It looked like one. And it could
have been just as dangerous
but it's likely an infection
of the heart's inner lining.
Something we call Endocarditis.
Are any of you aware
he was using needles,
injecting steroids?
What? No.
Um, once, yeah.
A few months ago, he said it
was human growth hormone.
Is he gonna be okay?
He should be, but he needs rest.
It might be good if you
guys go and do the same.
You can come see him first
thing in the morning.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Yep.
How's Will doing?
The last report I got,
he's doing much better.
- Good.
- Yeah, it is.
- Thank you.
- Here.
Hey, I just wanted to say I'm sorry,
you know, about what happened. I just...
I know, I know.
It's fine.
Well, it's not fine.
And I feel like you still
got something to say
so I just wish you'd say it.
Look, Deacon, I... I get
why you did what you did.
I really do.
It's just... it's gonna make things...
a lot worse.
I know. I'm sorry, okay?
It was just a split second thing.
And I just reacted...
I get it, honestly.
It's taken me years to learn
not to react to him.
You know how much I care about Jake.
I know.
And I'm sure on top of that,
I was flashing back to my own dad
and to things that he would do.
I get it.
You don't think I wanna
punch him in the neck
every time I see him?
I'll let you handle the heavy
hitting next time, okay?
Okay. Thanks.
Hi.
Excuse me. Are you Jessie Caine?
I am, yeah.
You've been served.
Sorry.
What does it say?
He's suing me for full custody.
What can I do?
Nothing. I just...
I need to make some phone
calls right now, okay?
Yeah. You make them.
Hey. Hey, buddy.
You guys just watching me sleep?
Yeah. You were snoring
pretty good there.
- Was I?
- How are you feeling, man?
Oh, like a thousand bucks.
Seriously, though, I'm gonna
take this IV home with me
and use it for my hangovers.
Steroids? Really, Will?
What were you thinking?
Guess I was just hankering
for some adult acne
and mood swings, you know.
It's just so stupid.
- Gunnar...
- No! I mean, why not?
He... He could have...
Gunnar's right. It was stupid.
But you already knew that about me.
Anyway, I'm sorry...
for everything I put you guys through.
Especially the mood swings.
I should probably...
Oh, yeah, take it, yeah.
I'm not gonna die.
- <i>Avery Barkley?</i>
- Yeah. Who's calling?
<i>April Levine from the Global Examiner.</i>
<i>I'm writing a feature
on Juliette Barnes'</i>
<i>mysterious absence from the public eye.</i>
How did you get this number?
<i>I'm told she's joined a
cult and fled the country.</i>
<i>Care to comment?</i>
She's on a service trip.
She'll be back soon.
<i>And what exactly was
the purpose of your flight</i>
<i>to Bolivia the other week?</i>
<i>It seems like a long way
to travel just to say hi.</i>
My purpose was private, okay?
And if you have any respect for that,
you won't publish this crap.
I was taking requests for a coffee run.
Didn't mean to intrude.
It's okay.
You sure?
Just tell the guys
I've got to run an errand.
Okay.
Oh! Get checked! No, get checked!
- Hi, guys!
- Against the boards!
Hey, come here.
How about you come over here?
Sudden death. Kiss me, please?
- Are you serious?
- Oh...
- Please?
- You come here.
Oh! Booyah!
- You're kidding me.
- You're whipped, dude.
Gotta pay attention.
- Okay, yeah. Well, wait till tonight.
- Focus.
And we'll see who's laughing
tonight because...
What's tonight?
Tonight is my birthday.
- Nope, it's not.
- Yeah, it is.
No. It's next Tuesday.
How'd you know?
Because I'm a loser and I looked it up.
Okay, fine. It's my birthday week.
Oh, okay. Gotcha.
- Birthday week.
- Yeah.
And it's gonna be lit!
- Hey! What up?
- All right.
- Gracias.
- Why, thank you.
Thanks, man.
Did you know that it's bad luck
in certain cultures to refuse a toast?
Dude, dude, dude, chill out.
She doesn't drink.
I know, and I don't wanna
be a bad influence, so...
- Sure.
- Maybe I want to.
Yeah, dude, maybe she wants to.
Yeah, maybe she wants to.
Okay then. To an awesome week!
- All right! Cheers!
- Salud!
I really can't recommend
discharging you today.
Well, sorry, doc, but I
gotta get back to Nashville.
Then I'll arrange for
the home health nurse
to show you how to
administer the antibiotics.
And you have to follow up immediately
with a cardiologist in Nashville.
Whoa, whoa!
This whole thing's not in
my rearview mirror yet?
You ever torn a muscle or broken a bone?
Yeah.
Well, the same basic
principles apply here,
except we're talking about the
most vital organ in your body.
Your ultrasound revealed something
ambiguous on your mitral valve.
We're hoping this will be
enough to heal it.
But it's also possible it
will require surgery.
Surgery...
Possibly.
And, uh...
In the meantime as
far as playing shows...
To be honest, you shouldn't
even be thinking
about that right now.

Hey, you guys see Bucky's email?
No. What's up?
Well, we just been offered a slot
at Music City Music Festival next week.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
It turns out Hillary Scott's
gotta have vocal chord surgery.
So we're subbing in for Lady A.
In other words, we're like,
we're headlining.
That sucks for Hillary.
But that's great for us.
You'll be back in action by then, right?
Yeah. I just gotta check in
with a specialist at Vanderbilt.
But I feel ready to play already.
Well, there's no reason to rush it, man.
Says the guy who's trying
to steal my vocals.
Well, surprise, surprise.
Look who's back.
Brad, I'm really hoping that we can talk
reasonably about this.
Reasonably? That sounds great.
I'm just glad ol' Deacon's not here.
Look, if there's something
about my relationship with him
that upsets you, I would be
- more than happy to talk about it.
- Oh, darlin'.
I'm asking that you not
take that out on Jake...
Darlin', you are reading this all wrong.
I'm not upset in the least.
I'm worried about the safety of our son.
Brad, come on.
You and I both know that he's not...
- ...unsafe.
- Look, that the man's got a record?
All sorts of violent
and impulsive behavior?
And that doesn't even include
yesterday's assault, of course.
Deacon is...
incredibly sorry about what happened,
and he would be willing
to apologize to you about it.
Hmm.
I hear you, yeah,
but I just don't feel comfortable
exposing our son in that kind
of dangerous environment.
Brad, I'm begging you.
Please don't make us go through this...
- ...again over this.
- Sorry, I'm sorry.
Look, you're the one that's making this
all happen through your
poor romantic choices.
I mean, I thought you'd learn
to pick 'em better by now.
I mean, am I right?
- Oh!
- Oh, I'm so glad you're okay!
Didn't think I'd get a welcome party.
Well, Gunnar was kind
enough to let me know
when y'all were getting back in.
You know, I can carry my own bag.
Nope. I did my research.
You're not supposed to be
physically exerting yourself
at all right now.
To that end, I made you a
cozy little spot here
so you didn't have to deal with
going up and down the stairs.
Oh, I was kind of looking
forward to my actual bed.
They say after a heart attack,
you really shouldn't...
It wasn't a heart attack.
It was a heart incident.
And I promise a few stairs
is not gonna kill me.
- Oh...
- Oh, God!
Will? You okay?
Gotcha!
Well, his sense of humor is healthy.
Hmm.
Umm, okay.
We're going to get hot
chicken at Hattie B's.
Oh, my God. This is so stupid, dude.
- Just tell her, dude.
- Think bigger.
Okay. Um...
We're going to take a
rocket to Mars with Elon Musk.
Ha! I like it.
We should do that next year.
It should be next year's...
Hey, Maddie! It has to do with
jersey that he never takes off...
Bro, be quiet! I give the clues!
Hey, hey, hey! One rule.
- No hitting the driver, remember?
- I give the clues!
Are we going to a Predators game?
Close, but even better.
So much better, actually.
You're gonna love it.
- Dude, is this the players' entrance?
- Wait. What?
- They just give you the entire arena?
- Yeah.
I mean, I did
sell out back-to-back nights
- here last March.
- Wow.
Try this on. Ready?
- No!
- Isn't that cool?
- Come on! That's amazing!
- Isn't it? It's awesome.
Yo, where are the festivities?
Yo, attention deficit disorder.
I'm literally texting
the guy right now, okay?
Oh, that's what I like!
- There they are.
- That's awesome!
Come out on the ice,
let's crush it, bro!
- You're not coming out...
- Oh, God, you're so dead!
Maddie, Maddie, Maddie!
That's for getting me...
Okay, okay!
- Come on, bro, you got this.
- All right.
Bro...
Okay, wait, guys, guys, guys.
One at a time, okay?
- All right.
- All right?
Let's go!
- Wait, wait, wait! Who's first?
- Two, three!
Wait! No, no, no!
Okay!
Goal!
No, no! Okay, stop!
Time! Time! Time! Time!
I said one at a time!
I thought...
That was all of you at a time.
- Not even worth it.
- Oh, not worth it.
♪ See, I can't get you out of my mind ♪
Yo, can I have some of that?
Guys, I think this is him.
Are you rolling?
Watch your cable, come on.
- Hey, Avery? Avery.
- Hey, listen...
- Hey, Avery?
- Where's Juliette?
- On a trip. She'll be back soon.
- How soon?
Is it true that you flew to Bolivia
- to try to convince her to come home?
- Look, guys,
I know you're just doing your jobs.
But I'm not saying anything more, okay?
Is there any truth to the cult rumor?
- Come on, Avery.
- Just one more question.
Look who's home!
- Come here, sweetie.
- Hey, baby girl.
Come here, come here.
She's been asking nonstop
about Daddy and... anyway.
Sorry you had her for so long.
Please, it's the least I can do.
Call me if you need anything, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Bye, Cadence. I love you.
Come here.
Oh, it's so good to see you!
Mommy?
It's just me right now, sweetheart.
Just me.
- Oh, pancakes.
- Mm-hmm.
Ugh, cold pancakes.
Yeah, if you'd been up an hour ago,
they would have been life-changing.
Well, I was out kind of late
with Jonah for his birthday, so...
Believe me, I am well aware.
You were awake?
This might be hard to comprehend.
But when you're a parent,
it's hard to fall asleep
- till your kids are all home.
- I'm 18, Dad. Please!
I know. I'm well aware.
I'm trying to... wait... deal with it.
What?
Are you playing any of your own music?
Yeah. What kind of question is that?
I was just wondering if you've
written a song in a while.
Okay, one, is that like
your new favorite question?
And, two, yesterday.
You wrote a song yesterday?
- Yeah, really.
- What was that about?
It was about how you're a wet blanket.
Well, that's actually a
pretty rich area to mine, so...
Yeah. There's like enough
material for a whole album.
Stop it!
Sarah said they reached second base.
But Micah said it was
more like getting caught
between first and second base.
- Eww.
- I know, right?
Hey.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
What's wrong with your face?
Okay, obviously, you're
having one of your spaz days.
So I'm just gonna choose
to not be offended.
But I am here if you feel like talking.
Why don't you ask your stepdad?
What?
You haven't even heard?
♪ I know that I was given
everything I could take ♪
♪ From the moment I was living,
I was dying to make ♪
♪ Nothing out of something ♪
♪ Or real out of fake ♪
♪ It's hard days living in the world ♪
What do you think?
We play it at the festival?
Yeah, sure. I don't know.
I gotta get back to Cadence.
We can talk about it later.
Okay. Good seeing you.
Yeah.
Just feels weird without Will.
Yeah.
Yeah, come in!
Zach?
Hey.
What are you doin' here?
Well, I wanted to head
straight to New York
but I was at this fundraiser
in Napa when I heard.
And they said they'd already
discharged you, so...
That's not really an answer.
I came because I care, Will.
And...
Because, I don't know, I...
I feel responsible.
I'm not sure I follow.
When you came to me and said you wanted
to get back together, I...
Well, that was stupid.
I'm sorry I said it.
And, look, to be honest,
I'd rather we not...
No, Will! I was stupid, okay?
I'm... I'm...
I'm not used to rejection, and I...
I shut down.
What makes you think that
has anything to do with this?
I don't know. I don't.
You just seemed upset
and then with Mark...
maybe I'm being egotistical.
In which case, I apologize again.
You still with him?
No.
I watched your show on YouTube.
Mm, big heart-bursting moment.
No one can light up
a stage like you can.
You're gonna be back out there soon.
I'm sure of it.
How's that?
'Cause you're not someone
who lets something stand
in between you and your heart.
All right, well, I'll leave you alone
and get outta your hair.
You mean to tell me you
flew all the way to Nashville
for a five-minute conversation?
Well, you know, I am still
an investor in Highway 65.
So I have a lot of other reasons to be
in Nashville besides you, but...
I'll come back and check
on you before I leave.
You gonna sit down and
join us at some point?
Or you just gonna hover like a vulture?
Like a vulture.
Jonah's got this birthday thing tonight.
I thought that was last night.
- It's his birthday week.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna resist the urge
to comment on that.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
Don't wait up.
You been quiet, missy.
You okay?
Why does no one tell me anything?
I was gonna tell you.
- Well, instead, Jake told me.
- I'm sorry about that.
Why would you fight with his dad?
I guess because, if there's
one thing I can't stand
is when people are cruel to children.
Jake said he might not
be allowed to see his mom.
And his dad's gonna
try to make that happen.
Jessie and I are gonna try
to make sure it doesn't.
We're already speaking with a lawyer.
"Nashville's Next" starts on Monday.
I'm aware.
Maybe I shouldn't do it.
Look, sweetie, all this
stuff that happened,
it shouldn't have anything
to do with you, okay?
You wanna do the show,
you should do the show.
I wanna do it.
Well, then guess what? I got your back.
Okay.
You know, you don't
always have to hightail it
right after we... do our thing.
We could just, I don't know...
Cuddle?
Cuddle or order in Chinese
or watch a movie.
Or bear with me. I know it sounds crazy.
But you could always spend the night.
That does sound crazy.
Crazy enough, it just might work.
Uh, maybe.
Raincheck?
You got something going on tonight?
Yeah.
Okay.
We could make plans
for later in the week
like dinner or something.
Think you can handle that?
I think I could handle that.
Yes. Well, it is a date.
Everything all right?
Yeah. Don't worry your
pretty little head.
I'll text you then!
"From that day forward,
Fernando always remembered
"the importance of asking.
He was never without a playmate."
Again...
Again!
Baby, we already read
the book like three times.
Can you just try to close your eyes?
Please?
Who in the heck...?
Hi. What are you doing here?
Checking on you.
You gonna let me in?
You could have called, you know?
Yeah. Well, you would have
told me not to come.
How do you know?
You're more of a martyr than a whiner.
I'm the same way, if it
makes you feel any better.
I don't know if I have the energy
to be a good host right now.
You don't have to be.
Just pour me a whiskey
and I won't say a word.
Daddy?
I gotta take care of that.
Go for it. I've got my company.
All right, to 22 years on this planet!
Hopefully, I make it 22 more.
All right!
I wanna dance! Let's dance!
- I want to sit, okay.
- Funny.
- I'll go dance.
- I'll be there in a minute.
You should get this guy
to keep you company.
- Yes, you should.
- No, no, no, no.
Yes.
- He's got legendary dance moves.
- Yes, let's go.

It's not like it's hard
for me to handle Cadence.
I mean, I'm actually pretty good at it.
Guess you could say
Juliette made me a pro.
How's that?
She disappeared once before.
It's different circumstances, but...
And you took her back?
Well, not right away, but, yeah.
She has a special power over you.
Admit it. She does.
What is it about her?
I don't know. It's like...
It's like she has this fire in
her that's kind of mesmerizing.
Till it burns you repeatedly.
It took longer than it should have,
but I've learned my lesson.
There's no third act in this story.
What?
Man plans and God laughs.
Oh, I'm serious.
I mean, there's no other option for me.
I'm jumping off the roller
coaster once and for all.
The only hard part is it's just so...
Lonely, once you take the plunge.
Look, I'm not doubting myself.
It's just the routine, you know. The...
The habits you fall into?
Yes! Yes.
You know, like when you go to bed,
you have a ritual with someone.
Brushing your teeth,
talking about your day.
Warm breath on the back of
your neck as you fall asleep.
Yeah. Now each night I put
Cadence down, I stare at the TV.
I don't even really
know what I'm watching.
And just imagine these long nights
stretched out in front of me, a desert.
Sorry. This is stupid.
It's not.
Okay. Weak, at least.
Not being able to be alone.
Well, I think the whole
"learn to be with yourself" thing
is highly overrated.
In my experience, the only way that
you truly get over someone
is with someone else.
Is that what Gunnar is?
No.
Gunnar's just... nice.
All right, that's enough.
Get up. We're gonna dance it out.

I first joined the band?
Come on. Out with it.
I guess you confused me.
Huh.
I mean, you're hard to read.
Not like anyone I'd ever met.
Well, I could say something
similar about you.
Really? How?
You don't look at me like other guys.
How do other guys look at you?
Like something they wanna own.
I should, um...
I should get some sleep.
Not that I'll be able to, but...
Why don't you just close your eyes?
And what'll you do?
Be here.
Hey.
Uh, hey.
You didn't have to sleep on the floor.
I didn't mean to sleep here at all.
Yeah.
Uh, do you want coffee or...
I should probably just get going.
Yeah, okay.
I envy you.
Why?
You got a great bed head.
Hey, um...
Thanks. Thanks for coming over.
Of course.
Come on, girls! Before it gets cold!
Let's get this train rolling!
There's one. Where's your sister?
She said she's coming.
Well, good, 'cause
I don't wanna get there
and find that Radnor Lake
parking lot all full.
Wouldn't that be a shame?
Oh, come on now. You love hiking.
Hey! Hot this time, bacon.
We're good.
Oh, listen.
Make sure you got good shoes.
You got hiking boots?
- Why?
- We're hiking.
All right? We're gonna
be up on the trails.
We're not gonna stay down by the lake.
We're gonna walk up on
the trails and everything.
Okay.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
My stomach just doesn't feel good.
It must have been like something I ate.
I don't know.
Can I talk to you a second, please?
What? Why?
Upstairs, right now.
- I had one drink, okay?
- One drink?
You don't think I know what a hangover
looks like, young lady, huh?
Maddie, what the hell
is the matter with you?
I was just having fun with my friends!
- That's it!
- You need to find a new way!
Or maybe you need to find
some new damn friends!
- How about that?
- What are you talking about?
It's dangerous, baby!
It's irresponsible!
You're not old enough to be drinking!
- I'm 18!
- The drinking age is 21!
- I am an adult!
- Not in this house, you're not!
Then maybe I should move out!
I'm sorry for yelling, honey.
I am. I just...
Baby, if you're anything like me...
I don't gotta tell you
what it did to my life.
Years I lost with your mom.
Years I lost with you.
If there's even a fraction of a chance
that you're like me, baby, I just...
I'll be careful.
- Promise?
- Yes.
Great.
What?
I've just been thinking...
maybe it's time that I get my own place.
Because of all this, baby? I'm sorry...
No, it's not 'cause of all this.
It's something I've been
thinking about for a while now.
Can you do me a favor?
Think about it just a little bit more.
You need to get away a little bit,
go over to Scarlett's.
Hang out there for a while.
All right. Thank you.
Knock-knock. Hey, partner.
Hey.
All heart-healthy options, I guess?
Yeah.
Just came over to see how you're doing.
Great. Stronger every day.
Yeah?
'Cause it kind of seemed
like maybe you're trying
to put on a show for some of
us last time I saw you.
Well, what do you want me
to say, Scarlett?
I feel weak, angry.
My heart's messed up, maybe for good.
And I won't be performing,
not for a long time.
You're gonna get that back there.
I promise you.
Just maybe now is the time
to focus on other things
like writing maybe?
What?
- You're a writer, Gunnar's a writer.
- You're also a writer.
No. I sing and shake my hips onstage.
- You've written plenty of songs.
- It's not what I'm good at!
I'm a showman. That's my thing.
And I can't do it anymore.
There are people out there
who are completely paralyzed
and they learn to
communicate by blinking.
And people who are deaf who
write symphonies and stuff...
Well, I'm sorry for just
taking a moment to feel upset.
No, it's okay to be upset.
It's good to be upset.
It's better than the charade
you were putting on before.
You gotta do something
with it, you know?
- You have no idea what it's like.
- No, I don't.
But I do now that you got
hands and you got a brain.
So you should use them. Here.
I couldn't find my favorite
writing pens at the store
so I ordered you some online.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I barely touched the guy, all right?
I just took his hands off Jake.
I put him against the wall. That was it.
And I can testify to that.
That's exactly what happened.
I'm sure it is, but, of course,
you're an interested party.
Well, yeah, but so is he, right?
Right. I'm just saying there
are no impartial witnesses here.
I don't even know what that means.
I'm just saying that
I was just trying to stop him
from hurting the boy.
That's all I was doing.
Has Mr. Maitland...
ever been physically abusive?
Well, he's...
Not physically, no.
Do you have reason
to believe he was going
to hurt your son that day?
Frankly, just looking at this on paper
doesn't seem promising.
So what does that mean?
In these kinds of situations,
the court is going to draw
on whatever records it can
in assessing Mr. Maitland's claim
that you are prone to violent behavior.
And just looking at these
court records for you, Deacon,
past charges of assault and battery,
several drunk and disorderly...
All of that, all of it
was a long time ago.
All right? That is behind me.
That may be,
but at the end of the day,
these records paint a picture.
And I'm afraid it's one a judge may find
more consistent with
Mr. Maitland's story
than with yours.
You can't lose Jake.
That's the main thing.
The only way Brad can take him from you
is by linking you and me, so...
Just tell the court that we're not
seeing each other anymore.
And then we don't see each other.
And that's what you want?
No, I don't want it.
It's the only way I can see
to put things right.
So if it's what we got to do,
it's what we got to do.
This is nice, going out like this.
Yeah.
I hear this Broccolini is killer.
No, I hear the cauliflower
is worth dying for.
Are you making fun of me?
I'm making fun of this restaurant.
Geez, another mention!
This band is blowing up,
in case you hadn't noticed.
I kind of noticed.
What the heck is this?
I went over there to check on him.
You stayed the night?
I crashed there on the floor.
That's all you gotta say about it, huh?
There's nothing else to say.
You know, fine.
I'm just gonna go talk
to Avery about it.
Gunnar...
Hey, man, what's up?
You knew how much I liked her.
But you did it anyway!
What? Hey, hold on a second. What...
Oh, what? So you don't know
what I'm talking about?
Yeah, I got a guess, but
nothing happened between us.
We just fell asleep.
Oh, that's cute! What? You cuddle?
Gunnar, okay. Take a breath.
Let's just take this someplace else.
No, no.
I wanna have this out right here!
I'm not gonna fight you if
that's what you're looking for.
Well, too bad,
because I'm coming for you!
- Hey, hey, hey! Dude, look!
- Come on!
You gotta just chill...
I'm sorry.
Damn it!
- Dude, you okay?
- Yes! Yeah.
Does it feel broken?
You like her, don't you?
For the last time, nothing happened.
You can't go.
Daph, it's just a couple
of days at Scarlett's.
- And you're gonna get your own place.
- I don't know.
I mean, I could change
my mind and decide not to.
Can you just wait a little longer?
Why?
You just can't leave me
here alone! Please!
Daph, no matter what...
I'm never leaving you.
I'll see you all the time.
It's different. It's not the same.
I know it's different.
But it's gonna be different in a good...
- Hey.
- Hey.
You said you want to see me?
Something just doesn't feel right.
- This isn't right.
- Well, I agree.
I mean, before all this stuff happened,
we were good, right?
Or am I just crazy?
- You're not crazy.
- Then what are we doing?
- What we have to do.
- Well, that can't be it!
That just cannot be it!
Jessie, he's not gonna...
I am so angry that this man keeps
finding ways to control my life!
I hate that he has this power over me!
- Jessie...
- And I just really don't wanna lose you.
I don't want to lose you either.
Well, let's just... fight.
Okay.
How?
I honestly have no idea.
I hadn't gotten that far.

Maddie, you can't stay
just because I want you to.
I know.
What if I can't leave you guys?
I knew you couldn't go.
- Okay.
- You love my pancakes, right?
- No. Definitely not.
- No. That's not it.
- That's really not.
- Not that!
- Nope, not the one.
- That's not.

<i>Next on "Nashville"...</i>
We have a special guest.
I didn't expect it
to feel so good up there.
That might have been the
start of something beautiful.
Oh.
It means we go to war.
We put your boy on the stand.
I can't do that.
So that's it.
Let me ask you something.
Are you an artist?
Please stop telling me that
I'm too young
to write about what I'm feeling.
