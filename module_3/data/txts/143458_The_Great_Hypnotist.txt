Don't be afraid, my dear.
Is there a problem?
There is a woman wants to rob my daughter.
Please help me.
Don't worry, you're safe here with me.
I just read in the newspaper,
an old woman and her grandchild...
...were being chased by a violent man.
Hush! Quiet.
Then some nice security guards...
...chased the man away.
But guess what?
The man turned out...
...to be the child's real father,
while the old lady was a kidnapper.
What are you saying?
How do I know if
this girl is your daughter?
Of course she is my daughter.
This is our picture together.
Look closely at the woman in the picture.
What...?
Read this article.
Do you remember?
This newspaper is from twenty years ago.
(Negligent mother runs over her child)
Rui Rui, come here.
Remember now?
This is you from twenty years ago.
Time to let go.
The mistake we made,
let me bear it alone.
I'm sorry.
Rui Rui has already forgiven you in the past.
Mommy promises you,
I will live on.
Now listen to my count-
One.
Two.
Three.
Do you still see Rui Rui now?
I remember now,
she is gone.
Dr. Xu, you have been treating me for six months.
Why don't I recognize you in my dream?
Hypnotherapy... the best thing about it is that...
...it allows the patient to forget...
...that you are their doctor during therapy.
This helps the treatment.
But the subject
you just saw,
...is still a subject accepting
instructions while in a trance.
Today we will talk about Waking Hypnosis.
Actually Waking Hypnosis is very simple.
Right now, as I speak to you,
it's possible that you have already entered...
...into a trance inducted by me.
In fact, from the moment
you walked into this hall,
I have hypnotized you all.
Now, one, two, three.
OK, I didn't hypnotize you.
Let's look at the screen.
What do you think when you see this color?
Fire.
China. Red flag. Flame.
Blood.
OK, next.
Corn.
Sunflower. Sunshine.
Bananas. Pineapple.
Yes, all you can eat.
Next.
McDonald's!
Correct!
Studies show that most
of the time, most of us...
...receive "waking suggestion" from advertisements
Waking Suggestion is the basis of Waking Hypnosis.
My university classmates
studied Waking Suggestion extensively,
now they all end up in advertising.
Girl over there,
Dr. Xu,
from what I know, hypnotherapy
has always been controversial...
...because the patient is not
treated out of his own will.
Why don't we just use...
...a more straightforward method of therapy?
If you have problems, do you tell your parents?
I talk to my dad.
Do you talk to your best friend?
Yes.
What if you go home one day...
...and see your dad and your best friend...
...lying in bed together.
Who will you talk to then?
Don't laugh.
Over one million people
die from suicide every year,
do they have no parent,
best friend and relatives,
no buddies to talk to?
The problem is they can't talk about it.
Some patients don't want to talk...
...and some patients don't even know how.
I am a doctor,
to be precise I am a psychiatrist,
I don't just chat with patients.
I treat them.
My job is to cure them,
I don't care what method
I use as long as it works.
How do I know that
when a doctor hypnotizes me,
he is helping me instead of harming me?
Don't worry,
there are more than 300 people here today,
you're absolutely safe.
Wake up.
You gave a good speech,
but you are the same as you were in university-
short temper, sharp tongue.
Professor Fang,
you're not here today just to scold me, right?
I have a patient, it's a peculiar case.
I'd like to refer her to you.
Her name is Ren Xiaoyan.
She was adopted by a Hong Kong couple...
...at a local orphanage
when she was six years old.
She lives in Hong Kong now.
A few years ago,
she started to have this condition.
She consulted many doctors but it didn't go away.
Her foster parents are friends with my husband,
so they asked me for help.
But I feel you're more suitable than me.
What's her condition?
Heard of "I can see dead people"?
Delusion?
I wouldn't be here if it's that simple.
I arranged Dr. Shen Li
to treat her first in Hong Kong,
Shen Li says this patient is extremely logical,
her story has no flaws whatsoever.
This surprised Shen.
I'm surprised Shen even got her license.
There you go again.
If you are OK with this,
I will arrange an appointment as soon as possible.
Are you OK?
Uh... yeah.
There is a restaurant...
“.nearby.
We can...
...just walk there.
Let's go eat.
When I was a child,
my father often beat my mum.
Whenever he was dunk,
my mum hid me into the big wardrobe...
Doctor,
I don't know if I can talk about it...
Dr. Xu.
Come in.
Why are they still renovating?
I asked the carpenters,
they will finish soon.
Your coffee.
You can go now.
You have one more patient today.
One more? I thought there were four today.
Ren Xiaoyan, referred by Professor Fang,
she says you know.
I remember now.
Where's her picture?
I don't know.
This was just sent over from Dr. Shen Li.
The patient has been
waiting outside for some time.
Let her come in.
OK.
Miss Ren, you can go in now.
Miss Ren...
Excuse me, Miss Ren...
Hush“.
Listen to the clock-
something's wrong with the sound.
Maybe a mechanical problem,
I'll get it fixed tomorrow.
I see
it's slow.
Nice to meet you for the first time,
my name is Ren Xiaoyan.
Nice to meet you, come with me.
Sorry, no smoking here.
Wait a minute, I'll be right back.
Where are you going?
Nobody has lived here for years,
why must they renovate tonight?
It's affecting my work, tell them to stop!
OK.
Shen Li, it's me.
Ruining.
You're not already in bed, are you?
I just put my baby to bed, what's up?
I have a patient referred by you,
her name is Ren Xiaoyan.
Do you remember her?
Hello?
What?
Ruining, listen to me,
I know Professor Fang arranged this,
but I must tell you,
there is something wrong with this woman.
Miss Ren, you look good.
Sleeping well recently?
Not really,
I can't sleep sometimes.
Don't be nervous,
let's just have a chat.
Relax, tell me what kind of
pressure you're having.
Dr. Shen,
is it tiring to pretend to
care about your patients?
No matter how hard you try,
you're still looking at me like I'm a patient.
Miss Ren, I think there is a misunderstanding.
No, you misunderstand me.
I'm not sick.
Dr. Shen, you know?
Every abandoned child...
...will do anything to look for his real parents.
Once he finds them,
he will never let go.
Maybe you were a little over-sensitive?
Before I had Baby,
I was pregnant once, but I had an abortion.
So I felt really weird how could she know?
Maybe
she found some clues,
or maybe she's just talking about herself.
Isn't she an orphan?
I don't want to think about this anymore.
But... none of the doctors could help her,
I advise you to give up.
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.
Thanks for your time, goodnight.
(ORPHAN) ('GHOST') (Treatment failed)
Mo, it's me.
I just remembered that...
...you told me that your sister's husband...
...used to work for childcare services, right?
I'm sorry...
...to keep you waiting.
Miss Ren, you...
I'm not sick.
You're very sensitive.
You would be sensitive too...
...if you could see what I see.
What are you looking at?
Would you like to talk about yourself?
You wouldn't believe me even if I did,
why waste my time?
Just because I took a consultation fee...
...doesn't mean that I have to
believe everything you say.
You have no idea what I'm facing.
You mean "ghosts", right?
I don't believe in ghosts, period.
So you think I'm crazy too,
you are just like the rest of them.
Oh no, I'm more expensive than all of them.
But... since I have sold you my time,
you can try to persuade me.
Sometimes a brilliant lie...
...is more believable than the truth.
Dr. Xu,
have you ever heard sounds of marbles...
...coming from the ceiling when you sleep?
There are many explanations...
...for hearing marble noises from the ceiling.
Could be the pipes misbehaving...
...or just thermal expansion and
contraction of the building.
I think... you should finish listening to my story.
Please continue.
It's here...
Granny Li.
Granny Li, is that you?
Miss Ren.
Where's Uncle Zhang?
Uncle Zhang, that noise upstairs...
Miss Ren, are we disturbing you?
But I...
This morning I saw her lying on the floor,
the doctor says...
...she had brain hemorrhage.
Miss Ren.
Can you stop for a minute?
I'd like to, Dad.
But Morn hid the house deeds,
her seals and bankbooks,
she hid them all.
We have to find them.
Hey...
I have no idea...
We need them to sort put the legal tomorrow,
that's why we have to find them.
Did you look under the bed?
Yes,
we looked everywhere,
but didn't find anything.
Then I won't bother you any more.
What's up there?
Deserted air vent.
It's here...
It's right here...
I think what you're looking for...
...may be up there.
Everything is here.
Look,
family certificates, house deeds,
and mom's personal seals.
And this bracelet,
no wonder Morn hasn't worn it for days.
She hid it up there,
but how did she get up there?
That secret chamber must be quite high...
...to be able to hide a person?
Did I say that I saw a person?
Dejavu
You think I saw something...
...and then I made up a story, right?
You are not the first doctor who thinks this way.
Why can't it be a dream or a coincidence?
Why are you so sure it's a ghost?
It's not important what I saw,
the question is why do I see them.
Them?
More than one?
I didn't say I just saw once.
All right, then tell me more...
...about your most recent encounter with them.
I remember that it was my birthday,
I was out drinking with friends and it got late.
What's the matter, driver?
Nothing, It will be fixed soon.
Actually my house is just over there, I can walk.
Don't get off the bus, OK?
I'll fix it real soon.
Real soon.
I want to get off, please open the door.
Sorry, are you all right?
Little girl, are you hurt?
Why are you here by yourself?
Where are your parents?
Miss, the bus is fine now,
do you want to get back on?
It's all right, I can walk home.
What is it?
Can I help you?
Nothing,
I can walk home by myself, thank you.
What was the bus's license plate number?
84N16.
Good memory.
You think I made it up?
If it happened to you,
you would remember it well too.
Miss Ren, do you know what is a "montage"?
All these things you encountered...
...may be unrelated to each other,
but because they happened around the same time,
so your brain edited them together
like a movie montage,
so your brain edited them together
like a movie montage,
and gave them connection and meaning.
You think the driver is strange,
but it may be that he's
just in a hurry to get home.
And that little girl
could've got on the bus...
...while you were talking to the driver,
or maybe she was already on the bus.
I know I was the only one on the bus.
Stop taking notes, OK?
You are the most impatient psychiatrist
I have ever met.
Have you met a lot of psychiatrists?
More than you can imagine.
Then you know that patience
is not the only virtue.
OK, please continue.
Watch the road!
(WANTED: Car responsible for
hit-and-run accident)
Are you saying that the bus driver
is the murderer?
This case was solved and even made the news.
(Anonymous tip solves case)
Then how do I know you didn't
just make up the story...
...from reading the news article?
Do you have some evidence proving...
...that it was you who called the police?
I used a public phone,
how could I have evidence?
(March 5, 2013)
This story works...
...with or without ghosts.
Dr. Xu,
that's what I said,
it's not important what I saw,
the issue is why I saw them.
Miss Ren, let's talk about yourself...
...if you don't mind.
I do mind.
What's your relationship
with your foster parents like?
What's it to you?
They take you to see psychiatrists all over,
you already hate them for it,
so you come here with antagonism towards me.
You really are full of yourself, aren't you?
I know you are here not to solve your problem...
...but just to placate them.
Unfortunately,
I never allow my patients...
...to leave this room uncured.
I will use extreme methods if necessary.
So either you tell the truth,
or I will make you tell the truth.
So this is how you treat your patients.
I know very well how to treat my patients.
Have you ever tried...
...to understand your foster parents?
See from their point of view?
Running away won't solve anything.
If you care about them at all,
please work with me,
let's start from your life story.
Because“.
...you can't always use
being an orphan as an excuse.
When I was four,
my biological parents took me
to the amusement park.
Slow down.
I will always remember
the red flowers on the ground...
...and the cotton fibers floating in the air.
Later did I know that...
...the letter was their suicide note.
What did they write?
They owed a lot of money and had no way out.
So you feel abandoned by them.
How is that abandonment?
They left me alive because they loved me.
Do you remember your biological parents' names?
My father's name is Ren Jianguo,
my mother's name is He Qin.
Ren?
You didn't adopt your foster father's last name?
They wanted to change my name,
but I never agreed.
So that was that.
Do you remember where you lived as a child?
Nandu City.
I have been back there,
but I couldn't find any clues,
not even my birth certificate.
So you're from the south?
Your parents got into financial trouble...
...and they took you all the way to the north,
just to abandon you.
Come in.
Sorry to disturb you.
This is from Mr. Mo.
Off to see more documents?
I need to go to the bathroom.
In and out, in and out...
how can you make your patients trust you?
You never trusted me anyway.
Mo, it's me.
I got the documents.
Did you find anything?
Pretty much the same.
I just want to ask you-
if you know what kind
of tree has cotton fibers...
...or red flowers in March?
It sounds like the Red Silk Cotton Flower,
but it's from the south.
It doesn't grow in the north.
Do they grow in Nandu City?
Of course, it is the City flower.
Mo,
I need to ask you something else.
Okay.
Hello?
Ruining?
Are you okay?
Get back to me later.
Need help?
Let's get back to our topic,
let's talk about your foster parents.
How is your relationship with them?
Pretty good, they've been good to me.
But...
...deep down inside...
You can't let go.
You're afraid that if
you love your foster parents,
then you've betrayed your biological parents.
But have you thought about
another answer to your story?
The key is whether you want the real truth...
...or just the truth you believe.
What do you mean?
If you can trust me,
I hope you can cooperate further.
How?
Have you heard of hypnotherapy?
Don't be nervous.
First, just relax,
and adjust your breathing.
Focus on my watch.
Gaze into it,
and then I will count to three-
One...
Two...
Am I hypnotized?
Three!
Hold this...
Hold this tight...
Xiaoyan, what have you got there?
Come, show me.
Why are you here by yourself?
It's here...
It's here...
It's right here...
Little girl, are you hurt?
It's right here...
Where are your parents?
Just relax...
Relax,
nothing can hurt you.
Good.
Now you see a door,
the answer you are looking for
is behind that door.
Now open the door slowly.
I am afraid to open it.
Don't worry, you are completely safe.
Tell me-
what does the door look like?
Very old...
Very ancient...
I think I have seen it before.
Don't be afraid, open the door.
Tell me what's behind the door...
What do you see now?
Water...
Water?
What's in the water?
I can't see anything in the water.
Do you see anyone?
No.
Look closely, look around you.
Do you see anyone?
Sorry...
Who do you see?
It's...
It's not me.
Don't come for me, I can't help you.
You're already dead.
Please forgive me.
Can you hear my voice?
There is a door beside you,
if you can't take it anymore,
push that door and you will come back.
Is it 502?
502
Don't focus on the number.
If you want to come back, open the door.
I can't open it, it's locked.
Don't panic.
There is a key in your pocket,
take it out, use it to open the door.
Ren Xiaoyan?
Can you still hear me?
I want you to come back from that door.
Hear my count of three and come back.
Three...
Two...
I see a big lake.
A big lake?
What kind of lake?
There is a bridge...
A bridge?
Sleeping on the job, professional indeed!
What the hell did you do?
Nothing.
What did you do?
I didn't do anything.
You erased the tape recording!
Why don't you believe me?
Believe what?
Believe my story and I really can see.
Enough!
Go.
Hello?
Mo.
Wait a second,
let me take a look.
Amy, where's the fax?
Have you checked with Mo?
Yes I did.
What did you find this time?
I remember you said...
...that you saw red flowers and cotton fibers...
...on the day of your abandonment.
I wonder how you could've seen them.
From what I know,
the only tree whose red flowers fall...
...in that season,
is the Red Silk Cotton Tree,
but our Feng City, in sin the North,
Red Silk Cotton flower doesn't grow here.
So I wonder how you could've seen them?
Ren Xiaoyan, I can tell you now with certainty-
you were abandoned by Mr. and Mrs. Ren.
I've said it many times,
they didn't abandon me.
What's more, they are not your biological parents,
they are your first foster parents.
This is the certificate of your adoption.
It shows very clearly that
on May 28, 1978,
Mr. and Mrs. Ren...
...adopted you from Nandu's Sanyuecao Orphanage.
Nonsense!
You don't remember
because you were barely two years old.
Ren Xiaoyan, you are an orphan.
You don't have parents.
You don't have a name and a birth certificate.
Stop telling these lies!
My parents have passed away.
But actually they are still alive,
and they gave birth to a son after abandoning you.
How is that possible?
I want you to look closely.
Think hard,
in the depth of your memory,
(Mr. and Mrs. Ren Jianguo)
where did it all begin to go wrong?
The answer is inside your memory,
I want you to find it again.
(Nandu City)
Xiaoyan,
do you see it now?
What you are afraid of is your real past,
you never knew your parents,
and you were abandoned and adopted twice.
Now you can wake up.
Three...
Two...
One...
Do you remember now?
But I remember so clearly...
...there were red flowers on the ground.
That was the first time...
...you were abandoned by your real parents.
But you were too young,
so that memory stayed in your subconscious,
leading you to believe...
...that Mr. and Mrs. Ren
are your biological parents.
Basically,
your two memories overlapped.
There must be a mistake somewhere.
You have always neglected a fact in your memory...
...that He Qin was already pregnant.
Why would they fake suicide?
Because you were adopted.
Abandoning you would be against the law.
Reports show that the police...
...found them when you were nine,
but your current foster parents
refused to give you up,
so they hid the truth from you.
Don't you see...
...that all your ghost stories have
to do with your own life?
The glass marbles,
the little girl who got
separated from her parents...
Miss Ren,
from now on please stop lying, OK?
How dare you say that I'm lying?
Your birthday is March 3, right?
How did you know?
You just said...
...you met the little girl on your birthday,
and the next day you called the police,
then the newspaper reported the day after.
The newspaper is dated March 5,
so that means your birthday is March 3.
But actually you are an orphan,
you can't know your year of birth,
how can you know your birthday?
March 3 is my birthday.
I don't want to argue with you.
What about your fiance?
What fiance?
From the moment you walked in until now,
you have been touching the
middle finger on your left hand...
...six times!
Even though you took off the engagement ring,
your body reflex didn't change.
Are you afraid that I mention your fiance?
What are you trying to hide?
What happened to him?
Can you talk about it?
There's nothing to talk about.
Don't be afraid, old houses are like that,
the power will be back on soon.
Can I have a cigarette?
Miss Ren, I have been a psychiatrist for years.
Let me share something with you-
things that look non-important...
...may be more serious than we think.
It's already late today,
the session is over.
Please go home.
That's it?
Yes, that's it.
Please go.
Little girl.
Are you ready?
Ready!
Hide yourselves well.
Hurry up and hide.

Xiaoyan!
Director.
How is university?
So far so good.
I heard that you got full scholarship...
...in these past few years,
that's great.
Even though you're so busy with grad school,
you still come visit us,
I'm so touched.
Director Lin, please don't say that,
this was my home...
- ...and you are my family too.
- Uncle.
Who are they?
Them?
Volunteers.
They give us aid and supplies.
His name is Luo Yusong,
he came to our orphanage after you were adopted.
But he never got adopted,
so he grew up here.
I want to tell you something-
you said you didn't know your birthday,
I want to give my birthday to you.
From now on,
every year March 3 will be both our birthday.
OK, we will be late.
It's your birthday,we can't be late.
It's OUR birthday.
I'm grateful that the orphanage
gave me a stable life.
It made me realize that...
...there are two kinds of family-
one you're born with,
and another kind is the family you earn.
Xiaoyan,
I want to become your family.
Promise me,
never ever leave me.
But you know,
in the end, I will have to leave you.
Xiaoyan,
why did I die?
Why did you kill me?
It's not me.
It's not me.
It wasn't me.
It really wasn't me.
Then tell me who it was.
It was...
Who was it?
Who killed me?
Xiaoyan...
Ren Xiaoyan...
Ren Xiaoyan...
What did you see?
Ren Xiaoyan...
Ren Xiaoyan...
How did your fiance die?
Can you hear my voice?
OK, I'll count to three...
...and you will come back to reality.
Three.
Two.
One.
When did you hypnotize me again?
You must tell me how your fiance died,
so I can figure out how to help you.
Sorry.
Accident.
What?
Car crash.
Were you in the car?
How long ago was that?
Eight years ago.
Can you tell me the details?
I really can't.
Since the start of this session,
you keep saying that you can see ghosts.
See I believe what you said is true,
now can I ask you a question?
What question?
Have you ever seen your fiance?
Never.
Really?
If a person lies,
it's because he wants to or he has to.
What I'm saying is all true.
You are trying to believe it's all true.
Your fiance is dead.
Dead people don't come back to life.
What's he got to do With this?
Why can't you just believe me
that I can see ghosts!
Even if you really can see ghosts,
you still can't
bring your fiance back to life.
Dead is dead.
Dr. Xu,
I know you're smart and confident,
you flip things around to make me sound like...
...I am dreaming or just delusional.
I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid.
Can't you believe me just once?
I can believe you
if you give me evidence, not stories.
These are not stories.
I get it.
I get it now.
Even if you knew...
...that "seeing ghosts" is a mental illness,
you don't wish to be cured, right?
Because you want to see your fiance again.
Ren Xiaoyan,
as a psychiatrist, let me tell you-
there are no ghosts in this world.
People who have died,
no matter how much you love them,
you will never be able to see them again.
Accept that...
...and you will be fine.
Dr. Xu,
you almost convinced me.
But let me ask you something.
Why are there two people behind you...
...since I walked into this room?
Stop making up stories.
Today's session is over!
I really don't know why
I'm wasting my time with you.
One man, one woman.
The woman has long hair and almond-shaped face,
her eyes penetrate with their gaze.
The man,
short hair, thin eyes,
looks like the quiet type.
Do you know them?
I don't know what you're talking about,
I don't know what you're trying to do.
They say that your birthday is December 28.
Anyone can Google my birthday.
You see two people?
Where are they? Where?!
Didn't I tell you before?
What I care...
...is not why I see them,
what I want to know is...
...what they want from me?
They also say you're afraid of water.
Ridiculous!
Don't you want evidence?
Did you investigate me?
Who sent you?
Dr. Xu, you're really afraid.
- Go away!
- I'm telling you I'm not lying.
The two of them...
...look like they just climbed out from the water.
You can choose to believe or not-
from the moment I walked in,
they've been standing there.
Look, the water is dripping from their bodies...
...onto your shoulders.
Enough!
You don't believe me,
Captain?
How do you know that name?
Captain...
Captain...
Stop calling me by that name.
Listen, Captain.
I don't want you to say that name!
Who are you?
That man says...
...no matter how much you regret,
you can't bring anything back.
He doesn't want to hear you say sorry anymore.
I don't want to hear any of this,
any of this nonsense.
Whatever purpose you have,
today's session is over. You know?
Amy
Amy, where are you?
Get out of my way.
Get out!
What are you trying to do with this hand?
Look!
Haven't your hurt enough people already?
They want you to stop!
The woman says that...
...the question you asked her,
her answer is:
always.
Listen Captain,
they say...
...they don't want to see you
hurt yourself anymore.
I'm not listening!
Think about the stories I told you-
the car crash,
the bus driver,
dead people's wishes,
water,
502
You made them drink too much.
Don't...
Watch the road, will you!
I'm fine.
Your eyes are almost closed.
They are not.
Hold the wheel.
I'm fine, I didn't drink much.
Stop kidding around, you're driving!
- What are you doing?
- Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up...
You say that when a person lies,
it's because he wants to, or he has to.
Then what are you trying to hide?
It's because...
I killed the woman I love...
...and my best friend.
It's my fault,
I killed them.
It's my fault.
Wait...
Sorry...
Are you remember now?
Yes.
I remember now.
The man says he has already forgiven you.
The woman says her love for you will never change.
Do you believe me now?
I believe,
I believe you can see her.
Can you tell her that...
...I love her.
I will always love her.
She hears you.
When you wake up,
you will remember everything...
...and you will let it all go.
Three.
Two.
One.
Gu Jie...
Amy
Ruining!
Amy
Dr. Gu, I'll take it from here.
Hurry, check his pupils,
see if everything's OK.
I'll leave it to you,
let me know if he wakes up.
Got it.
Dr. Gu, thank you!
They are waiting for you upstairs.
He should be fine.
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Gu.
I really don't know what to say.
Because I know, this must be hard on you.
Gu Jie, you did a great job.
Professor Fang,
it's only because your method worked.
Extreme situation requires extreme measures.
Post-traumatic syndrome
is already difficult to cure...
...and he's started to hurt himself.
Dr. Xu...
Dr. Xu...
Dr. Xu!
Dr. Xu...
Sometimes we can't even be sure...
...if he's awake or sleep-walking.
Professor Fang,
we really don't know what else to do.
When you turn off the TV,
you will forget everything...
At first he thought he could use
his own expertise to convince everyone,
including himself, that he has been cured.
Professor Fang, some people think that...
...I'm no longer fit to practice.
They demand that I do this test for evaluation,
but this is just nonsense.
So I need you to sign off for me.
I know,
even if I don't sign off for you,
you will deal with it your way.
But can you deal with yourself
for the rest of your life?
Are you OK?
Uh... yeah.
There is a restaurant nearby,
we can just walk there.
Let's go eat.
I thought of a candidate,
but the treatment might be a little controversial.
Professor, I just have one question,
why must it be me?
Ruining's condition is caused
by long-term self-suppression,
he urgently needs psychotherapy,
but being a highly-skilled psychiatrist himself...
...and trained professionally,
normal treatment will do him no good,
because he knows the procedure too well.
Are you trying to hypnotize me?
It must be someone he believes to be harmless,
a patient, a stranger.
How can this work?
He and I know each other so well.
Both of you are my students, so I know you both.
Ruining is the best
in the field of normal hypnosis,
but you specialize in Waking Hypnosis,
you can induct a patient without him knowing.
Besides, deep down, Ruining longs to be forgiven,
and you are the key.
We both know,
our mental defenses are strongest when awake,
and weakest when half-asleep half-awake.
So we will pick the hour
when he believes himself to be strong,
but is in fact, already exhausted...
...as the start of the session.
Hello, Miss Ren.
Listen to the clock.
It's slow.
We will use hypnosis...
...to make him forget who you are.
Three...
Two...
One...
Nice to meet you for the first time,
my name is Ren Xiaoyan.
Fortunately,
Ruining doesn't know you used to have this name.
The advantage of hypnotherapy...
...is to let your patient...
...forget that you're a doctor...
...during the therapy.
The most difficult thing is...
...we have to make Ruining face his condition...
...and yet not reveal what we're doing.
So when he tries to hypnotize you,
you must agree to go along.
Of course, during this time,
we need Amy to work with us,
she will hide your real identity.
Amy
Amy, where is her picture?
Tell me what's behind the door.
Three...
Two...
One...
A very big lake.
Also,
Ruining can be quite ruthless in his hypnosis.
He has even hypnotized a patient...
...three times in the same session.
So we have to prepare for that.
Look at the back of my hand.
Why...
Why did you kill me?
If he tries to make you reveal anything...
...about your real identity,
my trigger point will come in effect.
- Who is it?
- It wasn't me...
You will see me then.
You are?
Now I want you to think clearly...
...why are you here?
Three.
Two.
One.
If he doesn't get a secret from me,
he won't believe me.
I know him very well,
I have to make him feel like he's winning.
How do you plan to do that?
There is a secret I never told anyone.
I have prepared my fake medical record,
just tell him this story.
Let me remind you,
there's something wrong with this woman.
I know what I'm doing.
His mind is so sharp,
are you sure he will believe this medical record?
I want him to not believe it.
But actually, you're an orphan.
My birthday is March 3.
Then what about your fiance?
Why can't you believe that I can see ghosts?
The issue is why I saw them.
In order to break his mental defenses,
we have to completely shatter his ego...
...and completely overturn...
...everything he normally believes.
Once his ego is shattered,
the cracks will start to show through,
and he will start believing whatever Gu Jie says.
There are two people behind you...
Three.
Two.
One.
It's my fault,
I killed them...
Do you believe me now?
I believe.
I believe you can see her.
Can you tell her that...
I love her.
Dr. Xu is awake.
Dr. Xu is awake.
Come with me to see him.
Great, let's to see him.
Professor Fang, I want to see Ruining too.
Cheers!
Sorry to bother you all,
it's our friend's birthday today.
She wants to come on stage and sing for us.
Shall we welcome her?
No.
Are you coming? If not, I'll start singing.
Don't!
Come on!
Gu Jie,
it's been hard for you.
He has finally let go,
what about you?
Professor Fang.
I will take good care of him.
Don't drink too much!
You drank too much, don't drive.
You go do your thing.
Just go.
I'm so happy today.
You're holding me too tight.
You...
...how long will you love me?
You know?
Whenever people tell me...
...not to take it too hard,
it's not your fault,
I feel like they are reminding me...
...that it is my fault.
What I fear hearing the most is...
...you did all you could.
Because only I know that...
...I didn't give it my all.
I should've tried a little harder.
So...
...it's not that I couldn't be cured,
I just didn't want to be cured.
Because I didn't feel that I deserved forgiveness.
Nobody“.
Nobody can forgive me.
You are right.
Nobody can forgive you,
except yourself.
