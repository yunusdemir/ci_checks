Ow!
Ah!
Huh!
Oh!
Whoa!
Look at their stride!
They're really tearing it up.
Good find, Runt!
Yeah, little bro, your tree hugging
talents have done good today!
They would give you two a run for
your meal, and leave me in the dust.
Oh!
Let's show them how to do it.
Okay, run them to the right.
Closing in.
Stinky, easy now.
Okay, Runt, now step it up!
Coming through.
Now run them to the rocks, guys!
It's show time.
Thank you, Mom!
Oh, Claudette, we could
have been feasting!
Too young.
But let's hear it
for the mom slide!
You're getting better, sis.
Great moves!
Thanks.
That turn? Amazing.
It's all in the paws.
My name's Fleet.
We're from the Northern team.
Hey, I'm Claudette,
this is my bro, Stinky,
and our younger bro, Runt.
Yeah, younger by two minutes.
So the Northern hunting team?
No, Northern team
for the Great Games.
The Great Games, what is that?
What's funny?
Wait a minute,
you really don't know.
Where are you wolves from?
The Western pack.
As in the Western pack.
Oh, right.
Makes sense.
Was there something the pretty
gossip girl wanted to share?
Easy. Magril says the Western
pack took a pass at the Games.
Took a pass?
When we hit junior status each region
sends in five junior-aged alpha wolves.
Huh?
Oh correction,
five junior-aged critters.
Doesn't have to be us alphas.
Just ends up being that way.
You know, winning.
The Eastern team!
Yo, Fleet, you gonna bring it!
We're going to bring it, Ed!
And let me guess,
the Southern team?
Yeah.
Well, looks like everyone is going
to bring it, except for us.
Fleet, back to training!
Uh-huh, coach is calling.
Hey, since you're not in the Games,
cheer for the Northern pack!
Did he just ask us to be
his cheer wolves?
And as the omega, I guess
that makes me the water boy.
Come on, we need
a serious discussion with Dad.
Very serious.
Yeah!
When the alphas are away...
The omegas do play!
Gotta love those
alpha hunting trips!
How long is Kate gonna be gone?
At least five moons.
Woohoo! Yeah!
Humphrey, my dog,
it's been too long!
Well, Mooch,
I'm a hubby and dad.
Had to put the omega in park.
Huh, who knew? The bachelor
with a bit of a reputation.
And along came Kate,
and I get tamed!
Tamed! More like
told to sit!
Dad.
Whoa, pups! How long
have you been there?
You had us at reputation.
Dad, do you know anything
about the Great Games?
Yeah, we used to play.
Well, why aren't we in it?
Last time we checked,
we were all juniors.
Though my skill set
is more of a senior.
Seriously, Dad.
Hey, remember when Kate
led us to victory?
Mom won that?
She didn't win it.
She killed it!
Remember the turns?
Dad, I'm feeling a little slighted
here and a bit snappy jaw.
Stinky, relax.
Yeah, well, I feel thrown
under the stampede!
Don't be dramatic, Runt.
We're juniors,
we should be playing!
Everyone should be playing!
That's the point.
The Games used to be for all
critters, not just alpha wolves!
Yeah, I did my Games with two bears,
one alpha wolf and a squirrel.
Huh, how did that work out?
Not so good, the alpha got
hungry and ate the squirrel.
Look, you know
what our pack stands for.
Until the Games return to being for
all critters, we're taking a pass.
But, Dad, we're never going to be
juniors again. This is our last chance!
I mean, Mom got to play!
What can I say?
That isn't how we roll.
What if we formed a team?
Huh? The right way.
Included everyone, and
showed them we can compete!
Claudette, the Games
are in a few days,
and it takes five
to form a team.
Those alpha wolves you saw,
they've been training all winter.
We came, we pleaded, we failed.
Go Northern pack!
What am I doing?
Get back here, you peckers!
Oh, isn't it cute,
flying around
little junior's snout!
Yeah...
Little junior?
I'll show you cute!
Whoa! Yo, junior bear.
Wait, junior bear!
So, tell me again.
It was this little guy, you
should have seen how fast he was.
And his jump!
Seriously, he almost laid up
a flock of birds.
So the plan is?
Have you heard of drafting?
And he said he was a junior!
Okay, wait,
I'm picking something up.
It's definitely a bear,
but not very junior.
I'm smelling it too.
Yeah, it's getting stronger.
Hi there, we're just here
to find this cub, junior guy.
We just want him
to join our team.
What the...
Oh, my gosh, there he is!
And there they are!
Hi, I saw you on the field today
and I wanted to come
and have a friendly chat.
You're a junior?
Uh, yeah.
Great,
my brothers and I want to talk to
you about joining the Great Games.
100 feet.
Sis, we may need to take them on.
50 feet.
Aren't the Games
an all alpha wolf club?
30 feet.
We want to make it
for the entire Western region.
20 feet.
Got it!
Wow. I should learn that.
My name is Claudette,
and this is Stinky and Runt.
I'm Brent and this is my friend.
And protector, Agnes.
Uh, protector?
Protector, mentor, coach,
agent. What's the pitch?
Well, Brent, I saw you
running in the field today.
Looks like you were
chasing birds.
You see, everyone saw it!
Brent, it's okay!
No, it's not!
Ah. Okay, reset.
You were saying?
Look, you're really fast, and
from what I saw, a great jumper.
Ah, shucks,
I'm just a country bear.
Is there an offer?
Yeah, to join our team.
But what else?
Like what?
Hmm, the wolves have a nice
bunch of berry bushes.
Done.
And Salmon Falls, for fishing?
Done.
Okay,
we'll get back to you.
What? I need to know now!
We only have a few days of
training before the Games begin!
Pushy, pushy.
Brent, huddle.
She is working you!
I know, but I want to do it,
and I'm a junior.
Aren't we all.
Okay, I'll do it,
but Agnes comes.
Yeah, great to have supporters!
No, she comes
as part of the team.
Okay, he gets worked,
and I get stares?
Western team.
Look strong.
He's fast.
But he can't turn
like you, Claudette.
He didn't have Mom to teach him.
Well, I did, and I still
can't turn like you.
Hey there.
Hi!
So, is this
my cheering section? Huh?
That's funny, more like
kick-your-butt section.
And we could settle it
right now if you want.
Whoa.
Now that's a throw down.
Ah, hey, wolves, I think we'll
just practice today, okay?
Hey, you need the field?
Well, it might be a good
to take a few laps.
Sure. Go for it.
Western team, we're going to take
a few laps around the field!
Slow build to a hunting stride.
Yo, Ed, right?
Um, yeah, hi.
We're the Western team.
Okay, let's kick it up a notch.
Let's get our legs under us.
How ya all doing!
Uh, Southern team, right?
What?
Ignore them.
I'll show those dogs fast.
Agnes! Stay in line!
Agnes, control your speed,
you know what happens.
What happens?
Nice catch, but get back
in line, you two.
Yeah, we're just dealing with some...
Growing pains.
Oh, no.
What now?
Oh, no!
Brent. what are you doing?
Uh, he's got bird issues.
Bird issues?
They're not birds,
they are monsters!
Ignore them, Brent!
Brent, the little birdy is your friend.
Not your enemy.
They are always fluttering
around my snout!
Because they like you.
They wanna to make friends.
They're rodents with wings!
Oh, oh, oh!
You want a piece of me?
Brent, chill. You're going
documentary on us!
Order, order on the field!
Where did it go?
I hear it over there!
Tweet, tweet, tweet,
oh, look it's a cub,
let's flutter around his nose.
Brent, time out
I still hear it!
Brent, calm down!
It's hiding behind
Stinky, I can hear it!
Sis, we need a coach.
A serious coach!
Incoming!
Shall we do the wolf pile?
Mooch, Mooch, no, no, no.
Too late!
We're middle aged now,
you're much heavier.
Ow!
Dad? Dad!
This is our coach?
Apparently.
I want to be traded.
Mooch, lay off the fatty
portions of the caribou!
Hey, what's up?
Dad, meet the Western team!
Western team?
Oh, you guys really want to mud
wrestle against the omegas?
Dad, this is team Western Region
for the Great Games.
You said it was for all the critters.
Yeah.
So we invited everyone.
Wow, they are one bird
short of Noah's ark.
Bird?
Bird?
Ow!
But, Dad, we have
a small problem.
We need a coach.
Okay, another reason
you can't play,
your mother is out of town,
as are all the alphas.
I know, coach.
What?
You want me to be your
coach for the competition?
Well, you'd be good for the
Miss Congeniality portion.
Dad, we need the help.
You know, the adult in the cave?
Claudette, I don't think...
Dog, help the girl out.
She went to all this trouble.
Okay.
Coach Humphrey.
Who knew?
Okay, sleepy heads, it's time
for training, come on now!
Let's do it!
Coach's orders!
Today we are going to train,
and train hard!
Brent, you look tired.
Yeah, well, actually,
I usually sleep until noon.
Me, too.
What is this?
Hibernation season?
Come on now, push, push!
Fight for it!
Mad wolf!
Run, run!
Dad, careful!
Come on now, lift those legs.
I did not sign up for this!
Keep the pace.
Faster, faster.
Show me what you got!
Oh, no, oh, no.
What?
She's taking off again.
Shake it off, Agnes!
Shake it off!
Stinky, control your aggression!
Runt, stop smiling.
This is a competition.
This is your life!
Dad, was Mom as fast
as this when she was a junior?
Focus on the race,
not on your mom!
Okay, Marcel, Paddy,
shock and awe!
Now come on,
you migrating chirpers!
Just say when, Humphrey...
Okay, Brent, control yourself!
Charge!
Okay, chirpers, attack!
Brent, look at my eyes.
Look at my eyes!
Okay, Paddy,
ready for the landing!
Storm the beach!
Storm the beach!
Their little wings flutter
around your face,
but they don't bother you.
Okay, Marcel, retreat, retreat!
Chirpers, flock this way.
I said now!
Okay, Agnes, now get
your center of gravity!
Okay, I'm getting it,
I'm getting it.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Way to take it for
the team, Runt!
I'm starving.
Me, too.
I saw some leaves back there.
Bones, anyone?
We have been eyeing
the competition.
Northern team
is the one to beat.
But get this, the referees
are also from the North.
Seriously?
They're geese. And you can't trust geese.
Well, we will watch them!
By the way, run Claudette
last today, trust me.
Yeah?
We've got your furry back.
Okay, formation!
Okay, rumble the legs!
Now, back rolls!
What is that?
It's called...
A warm up?
And who is
the angry-looking wolf?
Leg rumble, leg rumble.
Now leaps!
Oh, that would be
a sports parent.
Oh, great.
Okay, team, you heard him!
Heard who?
Their coach said leg rumble!
Dad, you're our coach.
Oh, right.
Okay. Rumble the legs!
Come on, come on!
Like this?
Something like that.
Okay, roll overs!
Okay, roll overs! Come on!
Hey, coach, Nars here.
Hi there. Coach Humphrey.
Put her there.
Hmm, you hear something?
No.
Well, great day for a game.
My alpha team is raring to go.
Yeah. Mine, too.
I just love competition!
I live for it!
Clearly.
Yes, I had a dream about this day.
It was so clear.
Running, sliding.
The thrill of victory.
You know.
Father!
I tried, to win it for you!
I really tried, I did, I did.
There is one for the birds.
Father, I mean,
she's a girl, I know, but...
It was the best that I could do!
Huh?
Okay, teams, get ready.
What are you looking at?
A bear is keeping pace
with the alphas?
You wolves ready for this?
Hmm? Hmm?
You ready
for the needles? Huh? Hmm?
Way to go, Agnes!
Watch your speed!
Show 'em what you got.
It's all yours.
No one is faster than my son!
Come on, Fleet!
Do the spin out, Claudette!
What? The spin out?
The spin out move.
I haven't seen that
since my Games.
She learned it from her mom.
Kate?
Yeah.
You know her?
I lost to Kate.
When I was a junior.
Where is she?
She's on a hunting trip.
Hunting trip?
So she wears the alpha
in the family, huh.
Yeah, I married up.
Well, Kate was a legend.
I don't see another legend here.
Hey, good job, team!
Fleet, how long
you been out here?
What's it to you, Claudette?
Oh, oh, oh, whoa!
Oh!
You have to lean your weight.
Mind your own race.
I'm just trying to...
My dad says you're good,
but not as good as your mom was.
All yours.
Thanks.
Okay, your turn, Claudette.
Here I go.
Okay, chasing the caribou,
gaining on them.
Then, changing directions, now!
Plant your front!
Oh, whoa!
Okay, let's try it again.
You're getting good!
Mom, I wish I could be as...
Oh, honey.
We're going to try again, okay?
Dad, I know!
You have to play
a little rougher tomorrow.
Why? They have the bear
and then a porcupine...
I mean, come on!
Just do it! You know
what I mean.
This could get
a little tricky today.
I'm ready for whatever
they've got.
I double-dog dare a wolf
to step on my back.
Stay on the attack.
We can do this.
Just be prepared.
Nice!
What?
Foul! Foul!
Umpire!
Agnes, up the log!
Get them on the log.
How do you like it, huh?
Good girl!
Good girl!
Umpire, did you see that?
Umpire, they were cheating!
She slipped into her!
What are they doing?
Laying an egg?
We couldn't clearly
see the play.
No foul!
What? That was as much a foul
as a chicken is a fowl!
Resume play on my honk!
Run the rocks!
Run the rocks!
Umpire, I can't believe this!
Yes!
Good job, Claudette!
You played it fair!
See you in the finals.
Magril, are you okay?
She slipped on the rocks.
Can you still compete?
No, Magril. Don't.
What is she saying?
Why won't she ever speak directly to me?
Dad.
Magril, are you okay?
Speak up, now!
She can't, Dad!
Why not?
Because she's terrified of you!
She's injured.
She's out of the Games.
Out of the Games?
Cheaters.
That's what they are.
And don't even get me started
on those umpires.
We ought to get the Western
owls to take them out.
Coach.
What now?
Magril is injured.
Oh, no.
Now, we can do this two ways.
Either we default
and it's all yours,
or we do a different race,
winner takes all.
You mean four against four?
No, one against one.
My son against Claudette.
A run around the mountain,
and then down to the field.
Fleet is strong on the rocks,
and Claudette on the field.
Well, let me speak to my team.
You got this, Claudette!
Go for it.
Okay, I'll do it.
Nars, you're on.
Good. You know, Claudette,
I wonder if your Games will
be as good as your mom's?
Dad, please.
I'm sure Fleet's Games will
be better than your Games.
See you tomorrow, coach.
Hey.
Sorry about today.
Huh?
Everything, uh, that happened.
Were you here to practice?
That is all I do.
You want to warm up together?
You just can't help yourself.
And you can't either.
Hey, you want to learn
how to do it?
But I'm your competitor.
Well, tomorrow you are.
Hmm. Sure.
Okay, when you come to a corner,
plant your front paws
and just let your body slide.
Your turn!
Plant your paws!
Whoa!
Fleet?
Fleet!
Why aren't you training?
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
Whatever that was.
Fleet, you have to hate
your opponent to win!
Oh, really, Dad?
And how did that work out for you?
Get back here,
you need to train!
I've trained enough!
Go ahead, Dad. Make me
a champion, right?
No excuses tomorrow,
you hear me?
Mom! You're back!
I came back early.
I got word of the Games.
I heard you're all
doing really well!
Well, just a few techniques
my mom taught me.
So, Claudette,
we're all thinking,
we have a chance to win!
We do!
Oh, Kate, you should
have seen Nars.
Nars, from the Northern pack?
Yeah, you left him a lasting
memory with your turn out.
He is so,
"bitter cave for one."
And the way he treats
his son, Fleet?
My first Games, it was
really important to me, too.
Mom,
what was the most
important thing to you?
Hmm.
Well, winning is fun.
But I think digging down deep and
seeing what you're truly made of
is what really counts.
The valley
is full of spectators.
And sponsors.
Oh, what conversations
we have heard.
Oh, Fleet versus Claudette,
a decade after Kate beat Nars!
However today turns out,
I am proud of you.
Thanks, Dad.
I've got this.
Okay, Fleet. This is it.
Keep four paces ahead.
This is the big one,
our last chance.
Our last chance?
You know what I mean.
Yeah, I do.
Hey, good race, Claudette.
Good race, Fleet.
Are those two smiling?
Wait, are they...
Humphrey.
It's okay, it happens.
Do you see that?
He is flirting with her!
That is what dogs do to throw
the girl off her game.
Is that what you did to me?
Well, yeah.
And I only scored the prettiest
alpha in the region.
Claudette!
Stop flirting with Fleet.
You're too young to date, I forbid
it until you are your grandma's age!
Oh, my gosh. Dad!
Could this day get
any more bizarre?
Hey. I think we scored
an endorsement deal.
What?
The wolves
from the central region.
When Claudette wins she is supposed
to turn to the crowd and shout,
"I'm going to Calgary!"
Come on, Fleet, four paces.
Come on, son.
Let's go, Claudette!
Take it to him!
Hey, push from your back legs!
That's it.
Um, thanks?
Get up there, Fleet!
Get up there!
She is letting him catch up!
Claudette, I don't care how adorable
you think he is, you take it to him!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Yes, you are.
For the last turn,
remember, lean to the left.
To the left. Got it.
Here we go!
Lean, lean.
I did it, I did it!
Now, what are you doing?
Nothing.
Fleet, go faster!
Tie!
It was a tie?
Oh, it appears so.
Fleet? A tie? Really?
We have to do this over!
What do we do
when there's a tie?
The Games end in a tie!
Fleet, you come back here!
That was it, Dad.
Those were my Games.
What do you mean, that was it?
I'm no longer a competitor, Dad!
I'm going to be the new coach
of the Northern region!
And I'm looking for a few good
competitors for next year.
Okay, Claudette,
now it's your turn, you yell,
say, "I'm going to Calgary!"
Well, we came, we competed
and we tied.
No, we didn't tie, Claudette!
Nope. We won.
Hey, Claudette!
One of these fine critters is going
to be on the Northern team next year!
And I'm going to be their coach!
Great, because we're going
for gold with one of you five!
Looks like we all won.
Yeah. I think
it was the coaching, right?
Claudette.
Yes, Mom?
You really turned
these Games around.
Thanks, Mom.
Son.
I am...
I am so proud of you.
So, we better get working
on your spin out.
Especially if you're
the new coach.
Yeah, when we're back
for the real Great Games!
Hey.
You two stay on the field
where I can see you!
Okay, Fleet, so you have to lean,
then push off your opposite foot.
Wait.
You never said push off.
Well, we were
competitors, Fleet!
