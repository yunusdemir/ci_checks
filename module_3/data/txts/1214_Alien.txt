<i>The food is terrible.</i>
Worst shit I've ever seen, man.
<i>What you say?
You got any biscuits over there?</i>
<i>I keep seeing corn bread.</i>
- I am cold.
- Still with us, Brett?
- Right.
- <i>Oh, I feel dead.</i>
Anybody ever tell you
you look dead, man?
<i>Oh, yeah, right.</i>
Now, I just
forgot something, man.
Before we dock,
<i>I think we oughta discuss
the bonus situation.</i>
Right.
<i>Brett and I,
we think we oughta...</i>
- We deserve full shares, right, baby?
- Right.
You see, Mr. Parker and I...
feel that the bonus situation
has never been on an equitable level.
Well, you'll get what you're contracted for
like everybody else.
Yes, but everybody else
gets more than us.
Dallas, Mother
wants to talk to you.
Huh? Yeah, I saw it.
Yellow light's for my eyes only.
Okay, get dressed, huh?
- Parker, come on.
- Can I finish my coffee?
- No, no.
- Thank you.
It's the only thing good
on this ship.
<i>Morning, Mother.</i>
- Right.
- Okay.
Plug us in.
Thank you.
- Where's Earth?
- You should know.
It's not our system.
Scan.
<i>I can't believe this.</i>
Contact Traffic Control.
<i>This is commercial towing vehicle</i>
Nostromo <i>out of the Solomons.</i>
<i>Registration number:
1-8-0-niner-2-4-6-0-niner.</i>
<i>Calling Antarctica Traffic Control.
Can you read me? Over.</i>
<i>Commercial towing vehicle</i>
Nostromo <i>out of the Solomons,</i>
<i>registration number...</i>
- Nothing.
<i>- Keep trying.</i>
<i>Calling Antarctica Traffic Control.
Do you readme, Antarctica? Over.</i>
- I found it.
- Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.
<i>- We haven't reached the outer rim yet.</i>
- That's hard to believe.
<i>What the hell
are we doing out here?</i>
I don't know.
What the hell are you talking about?
- That's not our system.
- I know that.
Do you ever notice
how they never come down here?
I mean, this is where
the work is, right?
Well, it's the same damn reason
we get a half share to their one.
Our time is their time.
That's the way they see it.
No, but... Listen, man.
Same old shit, man.
I think I know why they
don't come down here.
It's because of you.
You don't have no personality.
<i>Wonder what they want now.
What's going on down here?</i>
Um, you happen to be in my seat.
Can I have it?
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry.
<i>What's happenin' now, baby?</i>
Well, some of you may have figured out
we're not home yet.
- We're only halfway there.
- What?
Mother's interrupted
the course of our journey.
- Why?
- <i>Yeah.</i>
She's programmed to do that
should certain conditions arise.
They have.
<i>Like what?</i>
It seems she has...
intercepted a transmission
of unknown origin.
<i>- She got us up to check it out.</i>
- A transmission? Out here?
<i>Yeah.</i>
What kind of a transmission?
Acoustical beacon.
It repeats at intervals of 12 seconds.
S.O.S.?
I don't know.
Human?
- Unknown.
<i>- Well, so what?</i>
We are obligated
under section eight...
I hate to bring this up,
but, uh,
this is a commercial ship,
not a rescue ship.
Right. And it's not in my contract
to do this kind of duty.
And what about the money?
If you wanna give me some money,
I'll be happy to oblige.
- The man's right.
- Let's go over the bonus situation.
- I'm sorry. Can I say something?
- <i>Let's talk about the bonus more.</i>
There is a clause in the contract
which specifically states...
any systematized transmission
indicating a possible intelligent origin...
must be investigated.
- I don't wanna hear it.
- We don't know if it's intelligent.
I wanna go home and party.
Parker, will you
just listen to the man?
On penalty of total forfeiture of shares.
No money.
You got that?
Well, yeah.
All right, we're going in.
Yeah.
We're goin' in, aren't we?
<i>Approaching orbital apogee.</i>
<i>Mark 12, 11...</i>
Equatorial orbit nailed.
<i>Nine, eight seconds
on descent.</i>
<i>Grids energized. Fields focused.
Five. Four...</i>
- D.O.R.'s on line.
- How's the status on the lifters?
Give me an A.C.

<i>SR-1 stable.</i>
<i>Prepare to disengage

Let's take her down.
<i>Nine, eight, seven...</i>
<i>Roll 92 degrees port yaw.</i>
<i>Prime to port.</i>
<i>Prime ventral.
Prime dorsal.</i>
<i>Down a degree.</i>
<i>39, 000 meters.</i>
<i>Turbulence.</i>
Locked and floating.
You can drop us anytime now.
We'll catch you.
Inertial damping's going off.
Hold on, people.
There's gonna be a little bump.
What the hell was that?
Pressure drop in intake three.
Must've lost a shield.
Let's go with it.
Dropping off now.
<i>Still dropping.</i>
Here we are.
We've got it.
Take her down.
Navigation lights on.
<i>We've got 5-3 still out.
No problem. Just down 11%.</i>
<i>Grid status okay.</i>
<i>Nine,</i>
<i>eight, seven, six,</i>
<i>five, four, three,</i>
<i>two, one.</i>
Kill drive engines.
What the hell happened?
Somebody give me
a straight answer!
Is the hull breached?
I don't see anything.
We've still got pressure.
- Hit the screen.
- Right.
<i>Secondary load sharing unit...</i>
<i>is out.</i>
<i>Three to four cells
are gone.</i>
Is that it?
<i>No, hold on.</i>
<i>We can't fix it out here anyway,
and we need to reroute...</i>
<i>a couple of these ducts,
wouldn't you say, Brett?</i>
Dry dock time.
Dry dock.
Tell her we need to dry-dock.
Look, we couldn't fix it
out here anyway.
We gotta reroute
all these ducts,
and in order to do that
we've got to dry-dock.
What else?
<i>Some fragments kicked up,</i>
<i>and we've got to clean it all out
and repressurize it.</i>
How long before
we're functional?
Look, what is... What...
It's 17 hours, tell her.
At least 25 hours.
Yeah.
Get started on the floor panel.
I'll be right down.
What the hell's
she comin' down here for?
She better stay the fuck out of my way,
I'll tell you that.
I'd like to see what she's gonna do
when she gets here.
- Any response yet?
<i>- No. Absolutely nothing.</i>
<i>Except the same transmission
every 12 seconds.</i>
<i>All the other channels
are dead.</i>
Kick on the floods.
- We can't go anywhere in this.
- Mmm.
Well, Mother says
the sun's coming up in 20 minutes.
How far are we from
the source of transmission?
Uh, northeast.
Just under 2,000 meters.
Walking distance?
Well...
- Can you give me an atmospheric?
- Yes.
<i>Oh.</i>
It's almost primordial.
<i>There's inert nitrogen,</i>
high concentration of
carbon dioxide crystals, methane.
I'm working on
the trace elements.
Anything else?
Yes.
It's...
rock, lava base,
and deep cold.
<i>Well below the line.
Mm-hmm.</i>
I'll volunteer to be in
the first group to go out.
<i>Yeah, that figures.</i>
<i>You too, Lambert.</i>
- Swell.
- Better break out the weapons.
I can't see a goddamn thing.
Ash, are you receiving?
<i>Good contact on my board.</i>
Clear and free.
Keep the line open. Let's go.
Hey, Ripley.
Hey, Ripley,
I wanna ask you a question.
If they find
what they're lookin' for out there,
does that mean
we get full shares?
Don't worry, Parker.
You'll get whatever's coming to you.
Look, I'm not gonna do
any more work...
- till we get this straightened out.
- <i>Brett,</i>
- you're guaranteed by law to get a share.
<i>- What?</i>
- Why don't you just fuck off.
- What?
<i>What'd you say, Rip?</i>
If you have any trouble,
I'll be on the bridge.
<i>Hey, Ripley, come back here!</i>
Son of a bitch.
What's the matter?
Can't see a goddamn thing.
Quit griping.
I like griping.
Come on. Knock it off.
How's it going?
All right.
Have you tried putting
that transmission through E.C.I.U.?
<i>No. Mother hasn't
identified it yet.</i>
- You mind if I give it a shot?
- <i>Please do.</i>
Ash,
can you see this?
Yes, I can.
I've never seen
anything like it.
Very bizarre.
You said it.
All right.
Moving on to second...
position.
What is it?
Let's get out of here.
We've got this far.
We must go on.
We have to go on.
Will you say that again?
Shit.
Ash, as you can see,
it's kind of hard to describe.
I'm going back to the console.
Seems to be solid.
To walk...
You can on it.
Dallas?
Dallas?
Come on down here.
Something different down here.
I don't know
what it is, but...
See if we can get up that wall.
If we can get up that wall,
we can find out.
Amazing.
Alien life-form.
Looks like it's been dead
a long time.
Fossilized.
Looks like it's grown
out of the chair.
Bones are bent outward,
like he exploded from inside.
<i>Wonder what happened
to the rest of the crew.</i>
Let's get the hell out of here.
Hey, Dallas, Lambert,
come on over here.
Come on.
What do you got?
<i>See what you make of this.</i>
Ash.
<i>That transmission...
Mother's deciphered part of it.</i>
<i>It doesn't look like an S.O.S.</i>
What is it, then?
Well, I...
It looks like a warning.
<i>I'm gonna go out after them.</i>
What's the point?
I mean, by the time
it takes to get there, you'll...
<i>they'll know if it's
a warning or not, yes?</i>
<i>You okay down there?</i>
<i>Can you see anything?</i>
Uh... a cave.
A ca... A cave of some sort.
But I...
Well, I don't know, but it's like
the goddamn tropics in here.
What the hell is this?
The cave is
completely enclosed,
and it's full of...
leathery objects,
like eggs or something.
There's a layer of mist...
Just covering the eggs
that reacts when broken.
<i>Kane? You all right?</i>
I'm okay.
All right.
I'm okay.
I just slipped.
Appears to be
completely sealed.
<i>Wait a minute.
There's movement.</i>
<i>It seems to have life.
Organic life.</i>
<i>You there, Ripley?</i>
I'm right here.
Okay, Ripley,
I'm at the inner lock hatch now.
<i>Right.</i>
- Ripley.
- <i>Right here.</i>
We're clean. Let us in.
- What happened to Kane?
- Something has attached itself to him.
We have to get him to
the infirmary right away.
What kind of thing?
<i>- I need a clear definition.</i>
- An organism. Open the hatch.
Wait a minute.
If we let it in,
the ship could be infected.
- You know the quarantine procedure...
- 24 hours for decontamination.
He could die in 24 hours.
Open the hatch.
Listen to me.
If we break quarantine, we could all die.
Look, would you open the goddamn hatch?
We have to get him inside.
No. I can't do that.
<i>And if you were in my position,
you'd do the same.</i>
Ripley, this is an order.
Open that hatch right now.
Do you hear me?
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Ripley, this is an order!
Do you hear me?</i>
Yes, I read you.
The answer is negative.
Inner hatch opened.
My God.
What the hell is that?
How is he?
How are we gonna
get that off him?
- How are we gonna get it off?
- I'm gonna get some instruments.
My God.
Right.
I'll make an incision here.
Try and remove
one of the digitals from...
You're gonna do what?
Finger.
I'm gonna try and get his finger off.
Just a minute.
<i>No, that's not... It's tearing his scalp.
I know!</i>
It's not coming off
without tearing his face off with it.
- We'll have to take a look at him inside.
- Right.
How come
they don't freeze him?
<i>How come you guys
don't freeze him?</i>
All right, you can
take your mask off.
- What's it got down his throat?
<i>- I would suggest it's feeding him oxygen.</i>
Paralyzes him, puts him in a coma,
then keeps him alive.
<i>Now what the hell is that?</i>
- We gottaget it off of him.
- Just a minute.
Just a minute.
I mean,
let's not be too hasty.
We don't know anything
about...
<i>it.</i>
<i>Now, we're assuming
it's feeding him oxygen.</i>
<i>If we remove it,</i>
it could kill him.
I'm willing to take that chance.
Let's cut it off him now.
You'll take responsibility?
Yes, I'll take responsibility.
Get him out of there.
<i>Where do you wanna do this?</i>
We'll make an incision
just below the knuckle there.
Right here.
<i>Standby.</i>
<i>Good God!</i>
<i>That crap's gonna
eat through the hull.</i>
That thing's gonna eat
through the goddamn hull.
Come on!
What's going on?
This way.
<i>Next deck.</i>
<i>There it is.</i>
Don't get under it!
Don't get under it.
Looks like it's stopping.
- Take a look at this, man.
- Yeah.
Brett, give me...
What do you got, a pen there?
Give it to me, quick.
Come on! Come on!
<i>Don't get any on your arm.</i>
It stopped.
Don't see anything like that except, uh,
molecular acid.
It must be using it
for blood.
It's got a wonderful
defense mechanism.
<i>You don't dare kill it.</i>
What about Kane?
- Here's your pen back.
<i>- What do we do now?</i>
Leave Kane to Ash.
You get back to work.
Well, what...
Okay.
Try it.
Damn it.
I thought sure that was it.
Try it again.
I feel like I've been
in this place a month.
We shouldn't have landed in this place
in the first place.
Shouldn't have landed on this damn ball,
I know that.
Well, the sooner we patch this thing up
and get out of here,
the sooner we can go home.
This place
gives me the creeps.
<i>That's amazing. What is it?</i>
Ah, yes, it is.
Um...
I don't know yet.
Did you want something?
Yes. I, uh...
I'd like to have a little talk.
How's, uh... How's Kane?
He's holding.
No changes.
And, uh,
our guest?
Well...
Hmm?
Well, as I said,
I'm still...
collating, actually,
but, uh,
I have confirmed
that he's got an outer layer
of protein polysaccharides.
He has a funny habit
of shedding his cells...
and replacing them with...
polarized silicon,
which gives him
a prolonged resistance...
to adverse
environmental conditions.
Is that enough for you?
That's plenty.
- What does it mean?
- Please don't do that. Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Well, it's an interesting combination
of elements,
making him
a tough little son of a bitch.
And you let him in.
I was obeying
a direct order, remember?
Ash, when Dallas and Kane
are off the ship,
I'm senior officer.
<i>Oh, yes. I forgot.</i>
You also forgot the science division's
basic quarantine law.
No, that I didn't forget.
Oh, I see.
You just broke it.
Huh?
Look, what would you have done
with Kane? Hmm?
You knew his only chance of survival
was to get him in here.
Unfortunately,
by breaking quarantine,
you risk everybody's life.
Maybe I should've
left him outside.
Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us,
but it was a risk I was willing to take.
That's a pretty big risk...
for a science officer.
It's, uh, not exactly
out of the manual, is it?
I do take my responsibilities
as seriously as you, you know.
<i>You do your job...</i>
and let me do mine, yes?
<i>- Where's Dallas?
- In the shuttle.</i>
<i>??</i>
- Dallas.
<i>- I think you should have a look at Kane.</i>
- Why?
- <i>Something's happened.</i>
- Serious?
- <i>Interesting.</i>
Ripley, meet me
in the infirmary right away.
<i>Where is it?</i>
<i>Well, I don't know. I mean,
we ought to try and find it.</i>
<i>Yeah, let's check it.</i>
Dallas,
please be careful.
Sorry.
No, not in the corner.
Psst. Have one of these.
<i>Just in case.</i>
Kane? Dallas?
- You okay?
- I didn't see it. Was it in the overhead?
- What? It was up there somewhere.
- My God.
<i>- Cover up the damn thing!
- Wait.</i>
That's alive!
That's a reflex action.
Well, we've gotta
have a look at this.
Excuse me.
- Seems dead enough.
- <i>Well, good. Let's get rid of it.</i>
Ripley, for God's sake,
this is the first time
that we've encountered a species like this.
<i>It has to go back.
All sorts of tests have to be made.</i>
Ash, are you kidding?
This thing bled acid.
Who knows what it's
gonna do when it's dead.
Think it's safe to assume
it isn't a zombie.
Dallas, it has to go back.
Well, I'd soon...
as not burn it at the stake,
but you're the science officer.
It's your decision, Ash.
Dallas.
How come I've got to change my mind?
The decision's been made.
I'm not trying to change your mind, Dallas.
I just want you to listen...
Will you listen to...
<i>Just tell me how you can leave
that kind of decision to him.</i>
Look, I just run the ship.
Anything that has to do
with the science division,
Ash has the final word.
How does that happen?
It happens, my dear, because that's
what the company wants to happen.
Since when is that
standard procedure?
Standard procedure is to do what the hell
they tell you to do.
Did you ever ship out
with Ash before?
I went out five times
with another science officer.
They replaced him two days
before we left Thedus with Ash. Hmm?
- I don't trust him.
- I don't trust anybody.
What's happening with the repairs?
How's it going?
They're pretty much finished now.
Why the hell
didn't you tell me so?
Because there's still some things
left to do.
Like what?
<i>Well, we're blind
on "B" and "C" decks.</i>
<i>- The reserve power system's blown...</i>
- That's a bunch of horseshit.
We can take off without that.
<i>Yeah, we can.
You think that's a good idea?</i>
Look, I just wanna get
the hell out of here, all right?
Dust in the intakes again.
Number two's overheating.
Spit on it for two minutes,
would you, for Christ's sake?
<i>We're hot.
We're getting hotter.</i>
<i>Engine room,
red clip status?</i>
- One kilometer on ascension.
<i>- Engage artificial gravity.</i>
<i>Engaged.</i>
I'm altering the vector now.
<i>Inhibit C.N.G. control.</i>
- Struts retract.
<i>- Struts retracted.</i>
<i>Max stress to fifth overload.</i>
<i>Ease it back.</i>
<i>She's great. Beautiful.</i>
Walk in the park.
<i>When we fix something, we stay fixed.</i>
<i>- Don't we, Brett baby?
- Right.</i>
<i>What I think we should do
is just freeze him.</i>
<i>If he's got a disease,
why don't we stop it where it is?</i>
He can always get to a doctor
when we get back home.
Right.
Whenever he says anything,
you say "right", Brett.
You know that?
Right.
Parker, what do you think?
Your staff just follows you around,
says "right."
- Just like a regular parrot.
- Yeah. Shape up.
- What are you, some kind of parrot?
- Right.
Come on. Knock it off!
Kane's gonna have to go into quarantine.
That's it.
Yes, and so will we.
Well, how about a little something
to lower your spirits?
Thrill me,
will you, please?
Well, according
to my calculations,
based on time spent getting
to and from the planet...
Just give me the short version.
How far to Earth?
Ten months.
- Oh, God.
- Great.
Yes.
<i>Dallas, I think
you should come and see Kane.</i>
Has his condition changed?
<i>It's simpler
if you'd just come and see him.</i>
We're on our way.
Right.
<i>How are you doing?</i>
Thank you.
How you doin'?
Um, terrific.
Next silly question.
Oh, thank you.
Do you remember anything
about the planet?
What's the last thing
you do remember?
Huh?
I remember some...
horrible dream about...
smothering.
<i>And...</i>
And... Anyway,
where are we?
- Right here.
- We're on our way home.
Back to the old
freezerinos.
Could I have something to eat
before we go back?
I-I need something myself.
Yeah, right.
One more meal before bedtime.
I'm buyin'.
- Hey, that's a break.
- <i>Bedtime.</i>
The first thing that I'm gonna do
when I get back...
is to get some decent food.
I can dig it, man.
Let me tell you,
I've eaten worse food than this,
but then I've tasted better,
- you know what I'm sayin'?
- The other one over there.
Well, you pound down the stuff
like there's no tomorrow.
I'd rather be eatin' something else,
but, uh,
right now I'm thinkin' food.
<i>Well, you should know.
You know what it's made of.</i>
No, man, I don't wanna talk
about what it's made of.
I'm eatin' this just to...
What's the matter?
- The food ain't that bad, baby.
- What's wrong, Kane?
<i>Are you choking?</i>
What's wrong?
What? What?
- This is serious.
- Kane, what's the matter?
It's okay!
Hold him down!
Hold him...
<i>Get the spoon in!</i>
Damn it!
Get it into his mouth!
I'm trying!
<i>Oh, my God! Oh, God!</i>
<i>- No!</i>
- Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
<i>Dallas?</i>
<i>Dallas?
Yeah.</i>
<i>Anything?
No. You?</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>
<i>You see anything?
No.</i>
<i>Inner hatch sealed.</i>
<i>Anybody wanna say anything?</i>
This is just an ordinary prod,
like a cattle prod.
It's got a portable battery.
It's insulated all the way here,
all the way up to here.
Just make damn sure
nobody puts their hand on the end of it.
<i>It shouldn't damage
the little bastard,</i>
unless its skin's
thinner than ours.
But it will give him
a little incentive.
Now we just have
to find it.
I've taken care of that.
I've designed this tracking device.
You just set it
to search for a moving object, like so.
<i>Hasn't got much of a range,
but when you get within a certain distance,</i>
<i>it'll start
to give off a signal.</i>
What's it key on?
Micro changes
in air density.
Give me a demo.
See?
Again.
Got ya.
Two teams.
Ash, Lambert and I.
Ripley, you take
Parker and Brett.
Now, anyone see this thing,
you catch it in the net...
that Parker's holding
on his lap.
Parker, I don't want
any heroics out of you, all right?
<i>Catch it, put it in the airlock,
get rid of it.</i>
<i>Now, channels are open
on all decks.</i>
I want you to communicate,
keep in touch at all times, all right?
Let's go.
I thought
you fixed 12 module.
We did.
I don't
understand it.
The circuits
must have burned out.
What do we got here?
Damn it! Hold your light
over here, would you?
Yeah, that's it.
I don't know if this
is gonna work.
If I could just put this...
put this in there.
<i>Right.</i>
Oh, damn it.
<i>Check
the insulation.</i>
Oh, shit!
Steady.
According to this,
it's within five meters.
<i>Open the door.</i>
<i>Micro changes
in air density, my ass.</i>
It's within five meters.
<i>Be careful.</i>
<i>- Christ. Don't do that.
- Don't creep up on me with that thing.</i>
<i>You guys, stick together.</i>
- Don't fail me now.
- What?
- What is it?
- Parker, Brett, it's in this locker!
Where?
Here, take this.
Get over there
and get the net.
- Get it?
- I got it. I got it. I got it.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
All right, Parker.
When I say.
All right. Now.
Easy.
Wait! Don't let him go!
What the hell
are you doing, man?
It's the cat.
Hey, look, now.
We had to bag it, man.
Now we might pick it up
on the tracker again.
I'll... I'll... I'll...
Go and get it, man.
All right. You get him.
We'll go on.
Here, kitty!
Here, kitty, kitty!
Enough of that
kitty crap.
Jones.
Jonesy?
Here, Jonesy.
<i>Jonesy?</i>
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, Jonesy.
Jonesy?
Here, kitty, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, Jonesy.
Jonesy.
Kitty, kitty.
Jonesy?
Hey. Hey.
Come on, Jonesy.
Come on, baby.
That's a kitty.
<i>That's a kitty.
Come on, baby.</i>
That's a kitty.
Hey, hey.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
<i>Come on.</i>
Whatever it was, it was...
it was big and...
You're sure it took him
into the air shaft?
Disappeared into
one of the cooling ducts.
No question, it's...
it's using the air ducts to move around.
Could he want
Brett alive?
What?
Could Brett be alive?
No. I mean,
I don't think so.
Well, this air shaft may
work to our advantage.
Here it leads up to
and comes out in the main air lock.
All right. There's only
one big opening along the way.
We can cover that up,
and then we...
drive it into the air lock
and zap it into outer space.
This son of a bitch
is huge!
- <i>I mean, it's like a man. It's big!</i>
- Kane's son.
<i>Come on, Ash.</i>
I mean, science department
should be able to help us.
What can we do
to drive it?
Yes, well, it's adapted remarkably well
to our atmosphere,
considering its
nutritional requirements.
The only thing we don't know
about is temperature.
Okay.
What about temperature?
- What happens if we change it?
- Let's try it.
I mean, most animals
retreat from fire. Yes?
Fire, yeah.
Parker, can you rig...
<i>three or four
incinerator units?</i>
Give me about 20 minutes.
I'll do it.
- Who gets to go into the vent?
- I do.
No.
You and Ash...
take the main
air lock.
Parker, Lambert, you cover up
that maintenance opening, please.
<i>Right.</i>
I'm at the first junction.
Dallas, I'm right here.
<i>- Parker?</i>
- Yeah?
<i>Lambert?</i>
We're in position.
I'm just trying to get a reading here.
- The air lock is open.
- <i>Okay, Ripley.</i>
Ready.
All right. I've got
a reading on you now.
<i>Uh, open the hatch
to the third junction.</i>
Okay, I'm through.
Ripley?
Yes.
Close all the hatches
behind me.
I'm moving on.
<i>Dallas, hold it a minute.
I think I got it.</i>
- Yes, I've got it.
<i>- Where?</i>
It's somewhere around
the third junction.
Okay, moving on.
<i>It is right around there.</i>
<i>Now, Dallas, you're gonna
have to be careful.</i>
All right.
I've reached...
the third junction,
and I'm going down.
The hell's the matter
with that box?
<i>Dallas, you're gonna have to hold
your position for a minute. I...</i>
<i>I've lost the signal.</i>
<i>What? You sure?</i>
<i>Look around.
Are you sure it's not there?</i>
<i>It's got to be around there
somewhere.</i>
Checked it out, Lambert.
You may be getting interference.
Dallas, are you
sure there's no sign of it?
<i>I mean, it is there.
It's gotta be around there.</i>
- Dallas?
- God, what is happening?
All right.
Uh, am I... am I clear, Lambert?
I want to get the hell out of here.
Oh, God. It's moving
right towards you.
Um...
Move! Get out of there!
Behind you! Move!
<i>Dallas! Move, Dallas!
Move, Dallas!</i>
<i>Get out!
Move!</i>
<i>The other way!</i>
Dallas?
Oh, no.
Take it easy.
Dallas?
We found this laying there.
No blood.
No Dallas.
Nothing.
<i>How come I don't hear
nobody saying nothing?</i>
I'm thinking.
Unless somebody has got
a better idea,
we'll proceed
with Dallas's plan.
What? And end up
like the others?
Ohh. No, you're
out of your mind.
- Got a better idea?
- Yes. I say that we abandon this ship.
We get the shuttle
and just get the hell out of here.
We take our chances
and just hope that...
<i>somebody picks us up.</i>
Lambert.
The shuttle won't take four.
<i>Then why don't
we draw straws and...</i>
I'm not drawin' any straws.
I'm for killing that
goddamn thing right now.
<i>Okay.</i>
Well, let's talk about
killing it.
We know it's using the air shafts...
Will you listen to me, Parker?
- Shut up!
- Let's hear it.
Let's hear it.
It's using the air shafts.
We don't know that.
That's the only way.
We'll move in pairs.
We'll go step by step...
<i>and cut off
every bulkhead and every vent...</i>
until we have it cornered,
and then we'll blow it
the fuck out into space.
Is that acceptable to you?
If it means killing it,
it's acceptable to me.
Obviously it means killing it.
But we have to
stick together.
<i>How are our weapons?</i>
The weapons are fine.
- This one needs refueling.
- <i>Will you get it, please?</i>
- Ash, go with him.
- No, no. I can manage, Ash.
Don't follow me.
Ash?
Any suggestions
from you or Mother?
No, we're still
collating.
You're what?
You're still collating?
I find that
hard to believe.
- What would you like me to do?
- Just what you've been doing, Ash.
Nothing.
I've got access to Mother now,
and I'll get
my own answers, thank you.
All right.
There is an explanation
for this, you know.
Is there really?
I don't wanna hear
your goddamn explanation!
I want... I want...
<i>I want... I w...</i>
Parker. Lambert?
Ash, open the door.
Ash...
<i>Will you open the door?</i>
Let me by, Ash.
Yaah!
The hell are you doing?
Aah!
- Get her up. Get her up.
- Get her up.
Android!
He's an android!
Jesus!
<i>It's a robot.
Ash is a goddamn robot!</i>
God!
Oh! Get off me... Oh!
Holy shit!
Help! Help me get
this fucking thing off!
Aah!
God! Jesus!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
<i>How come the company
sent us a goddamn robot?</i>
All I can think of is
they must've wanted the alien
for their weapons division.
He's been protecting it
right along.
Parker, will you
plug it in?
<i>I don't know why...
</i> Because he may know how to kill it.
<i>Ash, can you hear me?</i>
Ash?
Yes, I can hear you.
- What was your special order?
- You read it. I thought it was clear.
- What was it?
- Bring back life-form.
Priority one. All other
priorities rescinded.
The damn company!
What about our lives, you son of a bitch?
I repeat: All other priorities
are rescinded.
<i>How do we kill it, Ash?</i>
<i>There's got to be a way of killing it.
How... How do we do it?</i>
You can't.
That's bullshit!
You still don't understand
what you're dealing with, do you?
A perfect organism.
Its structural perfection
is matched only by its hostility.
You admire it.
I admire its purity.
A survivor...
unclouded by conscience,
remorse or delusions
of morality.
<i>Look, I... I've heard
enough of this,</i>
and I'm asking you
to pull the plug.
<i>Last word.</i>
What?
I can't lie to you
about your chances, but...
you have my sympathies.
We're gonna
blow up the ship.
We'll take our chances
in the shuttle.
Blow up the ship.
Good.
Come on.
When we throw the switches,
how long before the ship blows?
Ten minutes.
- No bullshit.
- If we ain't outta here in ten minutes,
we won't need no rocket
to fly through space.
We're gonna need coolant
for the air support system.
You two go down,
get all the coolant you can carry.
I'll get the shuttle ready.
I'll give you about...
about seven minutes.
Come back up here.
I'll shut the switches off,
and we'll blow this fucker
off into space.
Okay. All right.
Come on.
- Ready?
- Care of yourself.
Seven minutes.
<i>Take it easy.</i>
Jones.
Jones?
Okay, check the bottles.
Jones?
<i>How you doin'?</i>
Fine.
Kitty.
<i>Okay. Go ahead.</i>
Jones?
Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst!
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come here, Jones.
Come here.
Jones?
Come here, boy.
Come here.
Nice kitty.
Jones?
Jones?
Come here.
Come here, sweetheart.
Jones.
Jones? Jones?
Jones?
Jones!
Goddamn it!
Now I got you.
Here, sweetie.
Nice kitty.
Oh, my God.
<i>- Get out of the way.
- I can't get out of the way!</i>
<i>Get out of the way, Lambert!
It's gonna kill us!</i>
<i>I can't!</i>
<i>Lambert, for Christ's sake,</i>
- get out of the way!
- Parker?
Lambert...
Get out of the way, Lambert!
Parker? Lambert?
Lambert? Parker?
Get outta the room!
<i>Oh, God!</i>
Parker?
