You're not her, are you?
You're the nano.
We're very curious about all of you.
Jason, I'm begging you, please!
Where is Jason?
Is he dead?
- Who did it?
- It was me.
Believe me, it was the last
thing that I wanted to do.
And I hate myself for it.
So if you're going to kill me,
you should just do it.
-(GUN CLICKS)
-(GASPS)
Man: <i>The people in town, they trust you.</i>
- Marion!
- You and Truman.
We're engaged.
I always thought he
and the Patriots
were bringing it all back.
(HORSE WHINNYING)
- Rachel: <i>Where's Miles?
- He's not</i> back?
Miles can take care of himself.
(GRUNTS)
He wouldn't be in this mess
if it weren't for you.
Where the hell do you get off
with this holier-than-thou crap?
You are a hypocritical bitch
and you are grinding him
into the dirt.
Ed, good to see you.
How's the trip been, comfortable?
Just fine, sir. Thank you.
Sorry we're running a bit late.
I just had a meeting
with Roger Allenford.
Have a seat.
- I think I'll stand.
-It's not a request.
What do you say we have
a conversation about failure, Ed?
- I can't help but notice--
- Sir, if you'll just--
Your commander in chief is speaking!
I can't help but notice...
...how one of our biggest,
most important operations,
one we've been working on
for months now,
has just gone nipples up,
in Austin.
General Carver should be dead.
Texas and California
should be ripping each
other to shreds by now,
clearing the way
for our manifest destiny,
but none of that is happening.
And do you want to know why?
Because Miles Matheson
and Sebastian Monroe
are both outside of Willoughby,
which is supposed to be your town.
So explain to me how
every single bit of that...
...doesn't fall squarely
on your shoulders.
Sir, with all clue respect,
that's a load of crap.
- Sit down, Ed.
- I sit down,
you shoot me in the face,
so the answer is, no, sir.
I will not sit down
so you can shoot in me
in the face.
I'm tired of sitting.
That's all I've been allowed to do
while you've sent one man
after another
into Willoughby to do my job.
If you have to kill me
for following orders,
then so be it.
But if all this has failed,
sir, it's not because of me.
It's because of you.
Sir.
(CHUCKLES)
Ah...
You know...
Hillary had a pair like yours.
Okay.
Okay?
If you want a shot,
you got one,
but you don't have much time.
Just 'cause Texas and California
aren't at war,
it doesn't mean
we can't still light the fuse.
Charlie: Miles!
Miles!
Miles!
(COUGHING)
Mom!
Okay, We got YOU-
Mom!
(TRAIN BELL RINGING)
Hello, Shaw.
Good to see you.
Welcome back, sir.
- The train yard's coming along.
- Yes, sir. How was the trip?
Honestly, better than expected.
- Did you get my message?
- I did. Where is he?
This is Ike Corbett. Ike...
Tell Director Truman
what you told me.
Yes, sir.
I was checking my snares
around the chemical plant.
I saw a camp, people...
Lots of people.
Thank you, Ike.
You're a true Patriot,
and I appreciate your service.
- That's got to be them.
- Mm-hm.
How quickly can you mobilize
your men?
How soon do you need us?
Now is good.
Yes, sir.
We'll off-load the canisters.
And you...
...find Tom Neville.
Tell him his services
are no longer required.
Yes, sir.
Aaron: What are you doing?
These people look really happy.
They're not happy.
They're just clean.
It was all a lie to sell magazines.
- Is something bothering you?
- I can't do this anymore.
- When do I get Priscilla back?
- Not yet.
What does that mean...
a day, a week, a year?
It means when I'm finished.
Stay in bed, you dummy.
If I have to lay here
one more minute,
I'm going to kill myself
and then kill you.
At least he's feeling better.
It's not as bad as it looks.
I'm just glad you got out.
Well, it was...
It's because of this,
you know?
You don't remember.
Monroe: There he is.
I brought you some medicine.
That's if it's okay with Mom.
(SARCASTIC LAUGH)
Uh, yeah, maybe later.
Since when do you ever refuse
a drink in the history of ever?
Come on.
(BIRDS SQUAWKING)
(SQUAWKING CONTINUES)
Are you doing this?
No, but you should run.
Why?
'Cause you're a lot slower
than everyone else.
Trust me, run.
I think we should run.
What got into Fatboy Slim?
Everybody run!
(ALL SCREAMING)
(COUGHING, GAGGING)
Woman: Hurry up! Hurry up!
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
It's mustard gas!
You got to get to higher ground!
Get to higher ground!
(GUNFIRE)
Move!
Go!
Get to the truck!
- Come on.
- Get in! Get in!
Aaron!
Prisilla! She's still out there!
We got to get her!
No, I'm sorry! Go!
(GAS HISSING)
(DISTANT GUNFIRE)
(GASPING)
Screw this. I got to get out there,
get to my guys.
You do that, we're all dead.
Now, be quiet.
(DISTANT GUNFIRE)
(GUNSHOT)
(GUNFIRE)
(MAN BREATHING
THROUGH RESPIRATOR)
(METAL CLANKING)
(GUNSHOTS)
(CREAKING)
-Hey.
-Hey.
- You're home early.
- Yep.
Trip got cut short.
I was just unpacking.
I'll be home for dinner tonight.
Oh, I got to see my dad.
After that, then.
Love you.
Come on.
Priscilla?
(PANTING)
Shh. Shh.
Come on.
Here.
How did you get out of there?
I found an old fridge, hid inside.
Aaron said that you warned him
about the mustard gas.
How did you know?
I smelled it.
Didn't you?
That cut you got...
...it's not going to open up,
is it?
Probably not.
We only got ten rounds left.
What are you thinking?
If that's the way
they want to play it...
...mustard gas,
then we hit them back,
and we hit them hard.
Twice as hard.
We're going to beat them
at their own game.
- You want to steal some?
- One can of gas.
You stick that
in the right place,
we take out 50 Patriots,
maybe more.
And what's the right place?
Wherever it hurts the most...
...even if that's
in the middle of Willoughby.
I'm not going to hear it,
not from that bitch,
not from that old man,
and certainly not from you.
- I am done talking now, Miles...
- All right, listen--
-...I am done talkin'.
- Shut up for a second.
No!
Look, we sit around here,
cupping our lady parts,
arguing about
right and wrong,
meanwhile, we are losing, Miles.
We lost 20 men today.
The only thing that matters, Miles,
is beating these guys.
If we have to take out some nowhere
town in the process,
then so be it.
'Cause it's war, and the guy I knew
used to understand that.
All right. Okay.
I get it.
I'm in.
We're going to get you some payback.
All right, come on, let's hear it.
Get it out of your system.
I'm sorry.
What exactly do you want me to say?
You know,
how I'm a son of a bitch
for stealing this gas.
How it's going to kill
a bunch of innocent people.
Not this time.
You don't care. Why should I?
I don't have a lot of options here,
Rachel.
Please.
This is about you and Bass
and whatever the hell that is.
I have never been able to compete,
and I'm done trying.
You and me...
...we're done.
Bass wins.
And what makes you think
this plan is going to work?
Because if they hit us
that hard the first time,
they're going to want to finish
the job, okay?
Just keep walking, genius.
Listen, man,
I am sorry about Rachel.
She's a... sweet girl.
So...
- How you going to do it?
- Do what?
You got this big plan to...
...recapture the
Monroe Republic.
I want to know how.
Well, we've still got troops
all over the Northeast.
We show up, it's going to be like
the Second Coming.
Take care of the Patriots,
then Georgia is wide open.
What?
So this isn't just about
the Monroe Republic.
This is about the Eastern Seaboard.
It's all ours for the taking, Miles.
It's better us than the Patriots.
At least we can
restore some sanity.
Sanity, right.
And quit saying "we,"
like I'm a part of this.
Okay.
Come on, Bass...
...how is this not going to turn
into the same nightmare
it was before?
It's going to be different
this time, Miles.
I learn from my mistakes.
I can't do it alone. I know.
My kid's going to help.
Maybe... I'm not...
I'm not pushing you,
but maybe one day...
One day you'll
want to help me too.
I really hope you do.
- Hey, Rachel.
- Rachel: Yeah?
I'm going to go look for some food.
I'll be back.
Wait. I'll go with you.
Aaron?
Shaw: Tom Neville.
You're Truman's man.
Shaw, right?
Been out looking for Monroe?
I have.
Any luck?
-It's a process, right?
- Yeah.
I take it Truman wants
a progress report.
You know the boss.
Hard for him to sit with
that stick up his ass.
(LAUGHS)
Come on in.
I've been all over the woods.
Tomorrow I'm going to search
the north side.
I'll find him.
You want a drink?
Uh...
I'm afraid I don't have the time.
Come on...
...just one drink.
Stay a while.
(SCREAMING)
Sorry about that.
(SHAW MOANING)
I put it in myself.
I'm kind of a stickler
for personal security.
(MOANING)
Make yourself comfortable.
We got a lot to talk about.
You need some help?
(SCREAMING)
If you don't let me out...
...you're dead.
Is that the view from down there?
So you're coming to kill me.
That means, someone,
somewhere in DC,
is coming to kill my wife, right?
I don't know anything about that.
(SCREAMS)
(SOBBING)
The only reason you people
were keeping her alive...
...was leverage.
I'm telling you, I don't know!
She's dead...
or about to be, right?
Jason was right...
Right as rain
about you people.
I was a fool...
...and now
I've lost them both...
Lost everything I ever
cared about.
I didn't listen to my son.
He tried to tell me...
...and that will haunt me
for the rest of my days.
Please. Please.
You people murdered my wife...
...my son.
And the Matheson bitch
may have pulled the trigger,
but you Patriots,
you loaded the gun.
Please. Please.
You're all guilty...
...and you're going to burn.
Please.
-(SCREAMING)
-(GUNSHOTS)
- Porter: Bob was a good man.
-(GASPS)
And he was lucky to have you
as a daughter.
Look at you you're...
...still out here every
Sunday like clockwork.
What the hell do you want?
Just to talk.
Come with me.
I am not going anywhere with you.
(GUN COCKS)
I'm sorry,
but you don't have a choice.
So what is this?
- We're just bait now?
- My dad knows what he's doing.
Really?
Twenty of my brothers
choked their lungs out today.
Your old man is leading us
into nothing but our graves.
Funny, 'cause I seem to remember
you running away,
while all those brothers
of yours died.
So don't go blaming him.
You're Monroe's little bitch
and you're going
to talk to me like that?
(CHOKING)
You don't know me...
...where I come from...
...or what I've done.
You don't know anything.
So show some respect.
(GASPING)
You two go around the back.
You three come with me.
(BREATHING THROUGH RESPIRATORS)
(MAN GRUNTING)
Hey.
All right.
Strap on, ladies.
We're going to have some fun
with these.
(DOOR CREAKING, CLOSES)
Oh!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't... I didn't see you there.
Aaron: Sir?
(GASPING)
♪ (MUSIC BLARES) ♪
Don't they look happy?
It's just like the magazine,
remember?
What did you do?
Why would people invent something
like mustard gas, Aaron?
Is killing not enough?
I'm leaving.
But we have so much
to talk about.
I have good news.
There is no way
any of your news is good.
I've observed.
Experimented.
I have seen Miles furious.
I've seen you frightened.
And...
...I finally reached a conclusion.
People are the problem.
They're miserable.
That's your big conclusion?
I could've told you that.
I know. I know you agree with me.
People are violent, irrational.
You're afraid of them.
For good reason.
They won't stop until
they burn the world down.
It's just in their nature.
But... what if we could change
their nature?
How?
I've altered their limbic systems.
If I could make them happy...
...content, then...
Everything would be all right,
wouldn't it?
Okay.
Well...
Good luck with that... really.
Where are you going?
(LAUGHS) I told you...
...we have...
...so much to talk about.
Come on, guys, whiskey outside.
Miles?
What's this? Miles?
- What are you doing?
-it's a little home-ec tip.
You mix lye and water,
and it neutralizes mustard gas.
We're going to use the gas, right?
Yeah. Just not in the way
you thought.
Gene?
So, what, Miles, this, uh...
This little breakup
with Rachel, that was--
God, that was an act.
Marion, this is
military-grade mustard gas.
The Patriots are using this stuff
on us.
God knows who else.
Yellow cross...
I saw an order that said
they were shipping in 100 tons.
Of something called
"yellow cross."
What would they need
that much for?
To kill us, you dumb bitch!
God, we...
Now we got nothing
to fight them with, Miles!
For what, huh?
Look...
I don't know how much more proof
you need.
They're not the squeaky clean US
that you think they are.
If they were, they wouldn't
be using weapons like this.
Well, what do you
want me to do?
Nobody has better eyes on Truman
than you.
We need you.
Tell us what he's up to.
You lie to me...
con me...
like I'm...
...I'm some, some chump.
'Cause you want to get Truman's
little bitch on your team?
Well, we got a spy
in Truman's house now.
And if she convinces
other people in town...
...we got an underground.
Who cares?
We could've used the gas.
We could've taken out
a truckload of Patriots.
And anybody else who
gets caught in the middle.
You said you wanted to win!
I do.
And I Will.
But we're not going to use gas.
We're not going to kill
innocent people.
We're the good guys.
Time we started acting like it.
Who are you?
God, Rachel is so far up your ass.
Oh, no, no, no.
This doesn't have
anything to do with Rachel.
This is about you and me.
I tried it your way...
...all the way to Philly.
Look how well that worked out.
I told you,
it's different now.
No, it's not.
You're going to keep making
the same brutal mistakes...
...and keep pushing away
or killing people
who care about you.
And you're going to...
You're going to end up alone.
You know why?
Because you haven't changed.
You're wrong.
You're wrong.
Miles: Stay.
Go.
I don't care.
This time,
we're going to do
it my way.
Hey.
So Monroe and Connor are gone.
Yeah, well...
...they'll either be back,
or they won't.
Okay, um...
Don't get me wrong, because...
...it's not that I'm not happy
about all this
because I am.
What's going on with you?
I was trying to tell you before.
- This... see that?
- Yeah.
I don't understand.
It's a guitar pick.
That's not just any guitar pick.
That's...
That is a 1960s vintage
Fender celluloid.
Pretty rare...
...even before the blackout.
But I had one just like it...
...the night that...
you and I first met.
A barbecue in Evanston,
remember?
So I'm laying there in that basement,
and I'm bleeding to death.
I see that,
right in front of me.
And I... I got it.
What?
You're a miserable person.
Excuse me?
We both are.
You ended the world.
I put a nail in its coffin.
- Hell of a pair.
- Okay.
But with--
But with all the things
we've done, you...
You should be cynical.
Hopeless.
But you're really trying.
Trying to be better.
Trying to build something
better for Charlie.
And how could I check out
without at least trying to do
the same?
I need you to know...
...that I didn't crawl out
of that hole on my own.
You and Charlie pulled me out.
Thank you.
What are we doing here?
We don't need Miles.
We're going to get what's
rightfully yours without him.
Tom...
Take it easy.
It's hard...
...seeing your son in danger.
You know...
...you really have to
appreciate the irony of it.
This whole time...
...you were my ticket
to everything.
And now that I finally got you...
...my ticket's expired.
You want to kill me, Tom?
You kill me.
But you're going to
let my son go.
I don't want to kill you.
You and me...
...we've got work to do.
