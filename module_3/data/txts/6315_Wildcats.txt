-Come on.
-I'm sorry.
Yearbooks are forever. Look serious.
-Okay, aII right.
-HoId it.
Janey, keep your arms down.
Come on. Pump them!
AII right, mean.
TeII me I'II coach girIs' track
for the rest of my Iife.
Come on, this gag photo
for the yearbook was your idea.
What the heII is going on?
Who Iet you use my uniform?
-Hi, Dan.
-MoII.
Sorry, babe. Didn't know it was you.
No probIem.
Anytime you wanna get into my pants,
just ask.
I never had sisters before. So Iong.
What a guy.
Come on, girIs. Keep your stride
nice and easy. Let's go.
Get your arms down!
MoII, our fearIess Ieader has returned.
-Who?
-WaIker.
Go ask him now before somebody
eIse does. Go get him, tiger!
Dr. WaIker!
Miss McGrath!
For a second
I thought you were Bubba Smith.
They Iook fine. You Iook fine, girIs.
Get those arms up.
How was the principaIs' conference?
-Very stimuIating.
-Good.
Dr. WaIker, an interesting thing happened
when you were away...
Nick MartineIIi went in for a doubIe hernia.
I don't think he's gonna be abIe
to coach JV footbaII this year...
and I'd Iike the job.
I teII you what, run it by Dan DarweII.
If he doesn't have any objections,
it's fine with me.
Young Iady, keep those knees pumping!
Knees and arms, girIs.
-I got to ask Dan.
-The worst he couId do is say no.
He couId say, ''No, babes.''
You wanna know the best way to do this?
Don't taIk to him about it now.
-Not now? I Iike that.
-TeII him you want to meet him Iater.
-Later. Good.
-Sort of a date.
I'm not going on a date with him.
I aIready did.
TeII him you want to meet him.
Maybe pIay a game of racquetbaII.
I mean, the guy is disgusting.
-I'm not going on a date.
-How badIy do you wanna coach footbaII?
-I can't. I have to pick the kids up.
-I'II pick the kids up.
I'm warmed up.
Okay. Ready?
-I need to taIk to you, Dan.
-Sure, babes. How about over dinner?
-How about over racquetbaII?
-Okay. A quick set, then dinner.
We'II pIay to five. Ladies first. You serve.
I want to coach the JV, Dan.
MoIIy, a girI can't coach boys' footbaII.
You know that.
-No, I don't.
-My serve.
-Dan, I can handIe this. BeIieve me.
-Heads up!
One-zip. Supposed to hit the baII,
not the waII, babes.
I was raised on footbaII. I know more
about it than anybody eIse you couId get.
-I mean, coaching to me is Iike--
-Heads up!
You know I'm quaIified, Dan. I've known
you and Dr. WaIker a Iong time now.
You wouIdn't discriminate against me
because I'm a woman.
You know me, babes, I'm a modern guy...
but WaIker, I don't know.
Let's see what he says.
-We'II meet with him on Monday.
-Thanks, Dan.
-What's the score?
-Two-one, mine.
It's three-one, yours.
Dan, I'm sorry. I'm reaIIy sorry.
Are you okay?
I'm fine. Good game. We'II pIay again
when I don't have a headache.
-See you Iater.
-You're not sore at me, are you?
No, everything's fine.
-We're stiII going to meet with WaIker?
-Yeah, first thing Monday morning.
-Okay. You're not upset?
-I'm fine.
-Get out of here, you knuckIehead.
-Okay.
<i>Yeah. Go team. Throw the ball!</i>
-Mom, I Iost my sneaker.
-Put on your sandaIs.
-Verna, I found Dad's pIaybooks.
-Then I'm not going.
-AIice!
-What?
-HeIp your sister find her shoe.
-Why do I have to?
Because she's 6. You're 13.
As you get oIder, Iife gets tougher.
Look how Dad bIocked the sweep series.
He was way ahead of his time.
I Iove this pIay.
Hey, Mom, I found Marian's shoe.
President MuffIey had it.
LittIe son of a bitch aIso
ate my Duran Duran aIbum.
What'd you say?
Verna said it's okay to caII a dog
a son of a bitch, because that's what he is.
I can't beIieve I said that,
but it is IinguisticaIIy correct.
I got it.
-Hey, Frank.
-Hey, Verna.
How you doing?
-My Iips are above the water Iine.
-That's very funny.
-Hey, MoII. What's happening?
-Hi.
What's with aII that? FinaIIy getting
around to throwing that stuff out?
Yeah, I'm just throwing that out.
Daddy!
Hi, sweetie. Muffinhead.
-Kids!
-We're going shopping!
Guys, caII me every night, okay?
-It's just the weekend.
-WeII, humor me.
'Bye, baby.
'Bye, Mom. See you Sunday. I Iove you.
-'Bye, honey. I Iove you. 'Bye.
-'Bye, Mom.
By the way, Stephanie's parents
are having a cocktaiI party Sunday night...
so I'II drop the kids off earIier than usuaI,
Iike 2:30 p.m. Okay? Thanks.
Why didn't you teII him
about the coaching?
'Cause I know him. He'd put it down,
try to taIk me out of it.
So I decided to get tough,
stand up to him, and deny it.
Anyway, I'II teII him Monday
after I get the job.
I'm reaIIy very sorry.
If the position has been fiIIed,
there's nothing I can do about it.
Coach DarweII is within his rights
to seIect Mr. Remo as his JV Coach.
-But he's the Home Ec teacher.
-And a darn good one, too!
Mr. Remo, do you know
what a nickeI defense is...
or an open set formation,
or when to use a safety bIitz?
I can't say I do.
How about penetration? Do you know
how to get good penetration?
Miss McGrath, pIease.
We're drifting off the subject here.
Sorry I'm Iate. What did I miss?
Dr. WaIker was expIaining to me
why you picked someone...
no disrespect, Mr. Remo, who
doesn't know diddIysquat about footbaII.
Hey, you reaIIy wanna coach footbaII?
Fine, you got it.
What are you taIking about?
You said I couId coach JV.
Because, she's going to coach varsity.
The big ''V.''
-What?
-Jesus, Dan, don't--
At CentraI High.
Oh, my God.
I spoke to their principaI this morning.
If she is wiIIing to take no bonus
over her pay, they'd Iove to have her.
Here's his number. Ben Edwards.
Dan, I don't think CentraI
is the right pIace for a woman.
She can handIe it. Can't you, MoII?
Besides, maybe a woman's touch
is just what they need.
After she teaches them to sit,
she can take the thorns out of their paws.
-You think that's reaI funny, don't you?
-Yes.
Okay, Iaughing boy.
I'm going to take that job.
You think a woman
can't be tough enough?
I'II show you tough.
Watch me.
I forgot my purse.
HeIp!
Mr. Edwards?
Hey, come on, stop aII that noise.
You damned dogs.
-Hey, how are you?
-Fine.
I bet you're MoIIy McGrath.
-Ben Edwards.
-MoIIy McGrath.
Right. Come on in.
I want to apoIogize for the puppies.
I went out...
to chain them up before you came,
but they got away from me.
-Are those puppies aIways here?
-No, just when the armed guards are off.
I have some stats here
that you might be interested in.
Great!
It's pIay diagrams from
our touchdown pIays from Iast year...
pIayers' reports, things you might need.
Great! I just wanna thank you.
I appreciate this so much,
you taking this chance on me.
Right. How about some peanut brittIe?
We have a IittIe Ieft
from Iast year's fund-raising drive.
No, thanks. I'm too fired up to eat.
You got some reaI taIent here.
Raw, perhaps. I think with the heIp
of my assistant coaches--
-No assistant coaches?
-Right.
SchooI starts in a week,
so we better start practice right away--
No practice?
I wouIdn't even know
how to round the guys up.
But if it's any consoIation to you...
a number of our pIayers are returning
from Iast year, so...
maybe it wouIdn't take much coaching.
Your team onIy won one game Iast year,
'cause the other team's bus broke down.
Yeah, that victory party
was something to see.
Mr. Edwards...
Iet's second-think this for a bit.
Are you sure
I'm the right person for this job?
Hey, Dan DarweII toId me
that you were eminentIy quaIified.
He aIso teIIs me that
it's your Iifetime dream to coach footbaII.
-Is that right?
-That's right.
If word got around
that you chickened out on this job...
you think anybody
wouId ever offer you another chance?
Yes?
-No.
-Right.
-Coach, aren't you Iate for practice?
-I was just going.
-Are you nervous?
-No.
-WeII, a IittIe.
-I don't bIame you.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Wait a minute. You guys want to fight?
Go ahead. Punch each other's head off.
Doesn't make any difference.
OnIy teII your mother
you don't have a principaI anymore.
You got a paroIe officer. Understood?
Suited up and ready to pIay, coach.
Be on the five in fieId minutes.
Oh, God!
AII right, Iisten up!
If you're not here to pIay footbaII,
cIean out your Iockers and Ieave now.
I Iike her tits.
You. You're in training as of right now.
Put that out.
AII right. I don't intend to coach
a bunch of Iosers.
Now, if you're not wiIIing to work hard....
She has a reaIIy cute ass,
you know what I'm saying?
Guys, Iook--
I was raised on this sport. It's part of me.
I know that I can heIp you
Iearn the game and win.
I think that with....
If we just Iearn to trust each other,
there's nothing we can't do.
I mean, I'II heIp you. I'II be there.
I just need for you to give me a chance.
Now, what do you say?
Line up for caIisthenics!
Do you guys want to pIay footbaII or not?
Man, come on. Listen to her.
Come on!
We start out by stretching our hams.
Right foot over Ieft, and hang.
What is this?
You said we were gonna pIay footbaII.
-What's up with that?
-You can't pIay if you get hurt.
-If you're not properIy conditioned--
-Zip that shit.
TeII us when you want us
to pIay footbaII, sweetheart.
-What's happening, feIIas?
-What you doing here, Bird? Are you Iost?
So, you're the coach.
I am. Who are you?
Ain't no thing, baby. I'm just a footbaII fan.
Don't be too rough on these girIs,
'cause they reaIIy ain't got the stomachs...
for aII that physicaI activity.
Hey, Bird. You got a WaIkman?
I'm out of WaIkmans, but I got Casios.
Who wants a watch? Come see the Bird.
-Are they coming back?
-If there's a scrimmage here tomorrow.
There wiII be a scrimmage here
tomorrow at 4:00.
Do you want to show them up
at scrimmage tomorrow?
-He's our quarterback.
-They're the best guys we got.
AII the more reason to run rings around
them. Do you want to pIay footbaII?
I can't hear you!
Do you wanna pIay footbaII?
Don't wear yourseIves out.
I can't go back there tomorrow,
it's a disaster.
I'II caII Edwards tonight
and teII him I can't do this.
-DarweII has a pooI.
-DarweII bought a pooI?
No, he's got everybody betting
on how Iong you'II Iast.
-Oh, God!
-Is Wednesday a safe bet?
I want to forget this day.
AII right, sweetie. Thanks for the Iift.
-What's this?
-Just a IittIe something.
Thanks.
Mr. Edwards? MoIIy McGrath.
Not so good.
ActuaIIy, I wanted to teII you that....
I don't think that I'm....
That's not fair.
That it's not fair that I shouId be so Iucky.
I just wanted to say
thanks again for picking me.
Okay. See you tomorrow.
God, I even quit when I'm trying to quit.
15, 16...
1 7, 18...
19, 20. AII right.
-What are you guys doing here?
-You said there's a scrimmage today.
So take the fieId.
Yeah. Let's go, man.
AII right, my guys, Iet's huddIe up.
I can break his damn face.
Don't do that, man.
Let him pIay.
Stay in strong, right.
Remember our first wrinkIe, Peanut?
-I think so.
-What are they doing?
Kissing her ass, most IikeIy.
AII right. Let's fire them up.
Watch this.
Break!
Look at Peanut. That twerp!
Yeah! Sure!
That shit's pretty good.
-Let's show them what footbaII's aII about.
-KiII them.
MarveI, go deep. PhiIIips, run a post.
Let's take care of them. On you. Ready?
AII right, Iet's go.
BIue. 22. Crush you.
Come on. Stop those wimps!
I'm getting tired of this shit, man.
I'm going in.
-What are we going to run now?
-DoubIe reverse. I'II take it.
Why don't you just pIay quarterback?
I ain't seen you do no end-zone dancing.
Hey, come on. Somebody think
of a good pIay. Let's go.
Run anything, but just stay out of my way.
AII right. Left formation,
doubIe reverse on bean.
Try not to get me sacked this time,
bumbIehead.
Ready. Let's break!
That's on the chicken shit side.
Sorry about that, Coach.
I was running my bIocking assignment.
-I guess practice is over, Miss Coach?
-Let's get out of here.
Hi, guys. Hi, Jeannie.
-Nice day at schooI, Mom?
-TerribIe.
-But I got it aII figured out.
-Yeah?
I'm gonna get my oId job back at Prescott.
I'II be at the right pIace at the right time.
Remo won't Iast Iong with the JV, so,
when he bombs out, MoIIy takes the fieId.
Don't Iook at me Iike that.
Going back to coaching girIs' track
is not exactIy the same as quitting.
-DarweII hired somebody eIse for it today.
-I'II kiII him.
The probIem with kiIIing him though,
is that it goes on your record.
It foIIows you everywhere.
WeII, I can stick it out.
I'II bet she's getting in her van now,
tears streaming down her face.
She's too stupid to know when to quit.
But I hope she stays.
I onIy got a few more days
before I get my hands on her.
You're fuII of shit, Trumaine.
What's the probIem, man? She knows I got
10 pounds of dangIing fury waiting for her.
I know she wants it.
I can teII by the way she Iooks at me.
Put your pants on and Iisten up!
Baby, we were just taIking about you.
Don't caII me baby.
What did he say?
He says, ''Yes, ma'am.''
My name is Coach McGrath.
If that's too much for you to remember,
then just caII me ''Coach.''
-Hey, Coach?
-Yes.
Why don't you quit,
so we can get us a reaI coach?
Amen.
You don't get it.
I'm the onIy one who'II take this job.
You ain't good enough.
You want to get rid of me?
-You reaIIy want to get rid of me?
-Yeah.
AbsoIuteIy.
Step outside.
If I drop before any one of you...
-you can teII me to go to heII.
-We sure as heII wiII!
We'II heIp you pack your bags.
But...
if you quit before I do...
then from here on out, I caII the shots.
-Got you!
-We're coming up on you.
-We're gaining!
-AII right!
I'II bet you $50 the coach outruns them.
She's crazy if she thinks
she can beat Trumaine or CeruIo.
They're fast.
I Iove it!
CaII me and Iet me know who won.
What, you aII Ieaving?
I'II see you aII at the bank.
Here we go.
It's raining. Let's caII it a draw, okay?
You quit, you Iose.
I forgot to teII you.
-I ran the Boston Marathon.
-Oh, shit.
Twice.
You owe me a new stopwatch!
You pussies!
Fuck you!
Fuck you, what?
Fuck you...
Coach McGrath.
Better!
Frank!
I'm sorry to barge in Iike this,
but I heard about the IittIe job change.
WouId you mind getting out of here?
What is that on your eye?
Cheap mascara. Now get out of here.
SeriousIy, MoIIy, we have to taIk.
-Give me a toweI.
-I'm not offended by nudity.
Give me a toweI. A big toweI, Frank.
So how are you doing in schooI?
-Fine.
-Good.
Great.
Listen, I think it's terrific
you care about this coaching job...
and it's great that the kids wiII benefit
from your experience and expertise.
You caIIed, I wasn't home,
the schooI's in the ghetto...
and you started thinking about
terribIe things that couId happen...
thereby causing you inconvenience.
So, you're here to teII me
that you don't Iike me coaching at CentraI.
-I hate you coaching at CentraI.
-Tough.
Excuse me? What did you just say?
I said, ''Tough.''
So, schooI is fine, right?
That's terrific. That's just great.
You don't care about my opinion?
For the 10 years we were married,
your opinion was my opinion!
For the four years we were divorced,
your opinion was stiII my opinion.
-That's not true.
-Now I want my opinion to be my opinion!
You don't even know what you're saying.
I aIways gave you your own way.
-What?
-That's right. You wanted a van, right?
-No, I didn't want a van!
-Wait a second--
You wanted the van.
You wanted a van, we got a van!
I didn't want a van, you wanted it.
-So, are you getting ready for HaIIoween?
-It's onIy September.
Oh, of course.
...go out and trade in that
great IittIe VaIiant for that stupid van!
And now I have a van
and I wish I had a VaIiant!
That isn't poIite.
I was just on my way to the kitchen
to get some more water.
The kitchen is that way.
Stephanie?
Stephanie, heIIo.
HeIIo. Where's Frank?
-He Ieft.
-Oh, he Ieft.
-What are you doing, Stephanie?
-I was just waiting for you, Frank.
Come on, we're Iate. Let's go.
See you, MoIIy.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm sorry, are you aII right?
This is Iast year's scheduIe.
It's gone. Forget it.
You guys are better now.
Much better.
Now, tomorrow's our first game.
Forget the past.
Concentrate on tomorrow...
and don't be nervous tonight.
-You okay, Mommy?
-I'm fine, sweetie. Thank you.
You can sIeep in my bed with me
if you're scared, Mommy.
I'm aII right, sweetie.
Good night.
<i>Let's rock, let's rock
come on and boogie</i>
<i>Boogie down, boogie down
Wildcats are the best around</i>
<i>Boogie down, boogie down
we'll run those Cougars out of town</i>
<i>Boogie down</i>
<i>Let's rock!</i>
Okay, Iisten up.
Listen up. How can we concentrate
if they keep ringing that fucking beII!
If they're the Cougars,
how come they got a goat?
What are we bitching about?
We got a dog dressed Iike a cat.
Can we taIk about the game for a minute?
Okay. Jet, red right. 29-Z reverse.
Speak EngIish. Nobody understands
that code shit except you.
MarveI, you go ahead, come back.
I'II give it to you.
You give it to Trumaine.
Trumaine, you run upfieId, okay?
-On ''whore.'' Ready?
-Break!
BIack. 24. BIack. 24.
Your mother's a whore!
When we go with the veer...
you've got to hand off to the fuIIback...
unIess the tackIe commits to the inside.
Their tackIes have been forcing the pIay.
So you've got to read
the outside Iinebacker.
If he commits to you,
then pitch to MarveI around the end.
We're four points behind.
We can push right past them, right?
You don't sound very convinced.
Don't you guys have any pride?
-Yeah!
-Don't you have any guts at aII?
-Yeah!
-AII right, then. Get out and get tough!
-Yeah!
-Get mean!
Those Cougars wiII be furbaIIs
when we're finished.
Let's go eat some pussy!
Red. 26. Red. 26.
The Cougars are dicks!
AII right, come on, guys. Good game.
CentraI, y'aII stiII some rookies.
Good game, CeruIo.
Way to go, Kru.
Hey, you guys pIayed a great game!
AII right, we'II do better next week.
Give it up, CentraI!
-Nice game.
-Yeah, right.
CongratuIations. Good Iuck.
Good game, Coach.
-You'd better watch some more pros pIay!
-Hey, Mom!
So we Iost yesterday.
The important thing is,
you pIayed a good game.
-Don't bIow smoke up our ass.
-I wouIdn't do that.
EspeciaIIy not up yours, CeruIo.
You guys have to remember, we've got
nine more games before the season's over.
So we've got to get more discipIined,
work harder and get more organized.
CeruIo, cut it out.
-What's this?
-These are your pIaybooks.
I'II put a pIay up there,
you'II write it in your books.
I want you to memorize it, take it,
because you'II be tested on it.
-CeruIo, okay?
-It ain't me, Coach. I'm innocent.
You stoIe the Cougars' goat?
-Edwards.
-Edwards? His name's Edwards?
PrincipaI Edwards.
-WeIcome to our Iocker room.
-Right.
I thought you aII pIayed
a fairIy decent game yesterday.
Make that about 200 percent
more decent...
and we can start having
some victory parties around here.
We're working on it, aren't we boys?
Thanks for coming down.
I got a caII from the principaI
over at Jackson High.
It seems they're missing their goat.
I don't suppose anybody around here
wouId know about that, wouId they?
What did you say, Coach?
My guys wouIdn't know
anything about that, wouId we?
Good...
because if it's not returned today...
any person remoteIy connected
with the disappearance of that goat...
wiII be summariIy expeIIed.
That gets me steamed.
Right.
I'm sorry I interrupted your meeting.
A joke's a joke.
You guys are oId enough
to be responsibIe for your own actions.
I want a voIunteer right now
on who wiII take that goat back, okay?
Who's it going to be?
Good goat.
Good IittIe goat.
Stay here, baby.
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, baby. What's this?
I got hungry, so I fixed myseIf dinner.
ChocoIate chip is not what I caII dinner.
Where's AIice?
I'II fix you dinner in a minute.
-Hi, MoIIy.
-Jeannie! New hairdo?
-Yeah, do you hate it?
-No, but I think it reaIIy Iooks terribIe.
Great, no oId person has Iiked it yet.
We're going to the Iibrary.
-I'II take you.
-You don't have to.
We got sick of waiting around,
so I caIIed my mom. She'II pick us up.
I'm not that Iate. I can stiII drive you.
Jeannie's mom wiII take us.
I'II take you.
First I have to fix you something to eat.
I can't beIieve she didn't say
anything about it.
She must reaIIy hate it.
She just doesn't care.
I'm going to fix you a nice dinner
before you Ieave.
I don't want a nice dinner.
That's my mom.
Mom, I don't want to eat.
I just want to go to the Iibrary, okay?
I'II take you after you eat.
-We're going.
-No, you're not.
Jeannie, you may go.
AIice, you'II stay here and eat your dinner.
See you tomorrow.
You don't even care if I do bad at schooI.
It's aII your fauIt you came home Iate
and we didn't have any supper.
AII you care about are those stupid boys.
You don't even care about my hair.
You didn't even notice it.
I hate you.
AIice, open the door.
Okay, I hate your hair.
I reaIIy, reaIIy hate your hair.
I didn't want to be one of those mothers
who doesn't understand.
But I didn't.
So I guess I am.
What?
I wanted to be abIe
to taIk caImIy about your hair.
Marian, come here, honey.
You are the most important peopIe
in my Iife.
Much more important
than any footbaII team.
If that's true, why do you pIay with them
instead of making us dinner?
I was Iate because
I had to do the shopping.
I am now a footbaII coach...
and I want to be the best one
I can possibIy be...
just Iike I want you to be the best
at whatever you decide to do.
I want to be a heIicopter piIot.
Don't be stupid, Marian,
you can't be a heIicopter piIot.
Of course she can. She can be anything
she wants to be, if she works at it.
So can you.
So can I.
Daddy says you're going to quit.
He did, huh?
WeII, he's wrong.
I'm not going to quit.
I'm going to see this through...
but I need you to heIp me.
-Can you do that?
-Okay.
AIice?
Okay, sweetie.
-PrincipaI Edwards.
-Coach McGrath.
The goat showed up at Jackson High.
Must have been catting around, I guess.
I thought you'd be pIeased to hear it.
You don't Iook pIeased.
Krushinski toId me about Iast year's
quarterback, Lavender WiIIiams.
-Levander.
-Yes, the accent's on the second syIIabIe.
<i>-You know him?
-We have this hate/hate reIationship.</i>
You didn't show me his stats.
I'd Iike to see them.
I figured no sense
in having your mouth water...
for food you'II never get your fork into.
-Are you saying I can't get him to pIay?
-I think that's what he's saying, Coach.
-Right.
-I'd Iike to see his stats anyway.
Just for the heck of it.
Okay, I'II dig them out for you.
Let's see here. Say, Krushinski...
are you stepping down as quarterback?
It's Iike I can run good and throw good.
I just can't...
run and throw good.
-I'm thinking I want the team to win.
-Right.
-Wow.
-I toId you he was good.
He's aIso a criminaI and chronicaIIy truant.
I didn't know he was sick.
What cIass wouId he be in about now?
About now, he'd be in 1 1-A EngIish.
However, I seriousIy doubt
if he's in 1 1-A EngIish.
-CouId I have his address?
-You don't want to go there.
-Is Levander WiIIiams here?
-No.
-Where is he?
-At Maurice's.
Where's Maurice's?
Yeah, he's here a Iot.
He's one of my suppIiers.
But he ain't here now.
Say, Iady, is that your van outside?
You ought to consider stepping up
to some genuine wire-wheeIed hubcaps.
No, thanks. I don't care for any--
I was wondering if you know
where Levander WiIIiams is?
These beauties wouId cost you $400
anywhere eIse in town.
But since you're a friend of Levander's...
they're yours, instaIIed, $80.
If you couId just teII me
where I might find Levander....
$65.
That's beIow whoIesaIe, Iady.
-Whose baII?
-It's mine.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
PIease, just continue doing
what you were doing.
I was toId that I wouId find
a Levander WiIIiams here.
I'm Levander WiIIiams.
No, I'm Levander WiIIiams.
What?
AII right. AII kidding aside...
I reaIIy need to find Levander.
-He's about 18--
-I can show you about 18.
-Ain't no thing, Iet's go.
-Bird.
Man, what are you doing in here, Iady?
You're Levander, aren't you?
-I got an appointment to get to.
-Wait, Bird. I have to taIk to you.
I've been chasing after you for two hours.
-At Ieast give me five minutes.
-My pIaying days are over, Iady.
What's up, man?
-Three minutes.
-No.
-I reaIIy need to taIk to you.
-Bird, step into my office.
Let me handIe this.
Look here, our car won't start.
We were wondering
if you couId give us a ride...
-to my mother's house.
-You and Levander can chat on the way.
AII right.
Nice hubcaps.
-How much did you pay for them?
-$65.
You were robbed.
I ain't got time for footbaII.
I'm working on another career.
Take the next right.
If you're as good as your stats say...
then we couId attract coIIege scouts.
That couId mean a schoIarship.
-Yeah, over here.
-Is this where his mother Iives?
Yeah, she got sick of the suburbs.
We pIay Dearborn next week.
AII I need to beat them is a passer.
Give me the keys. Come on!
Shit!
-He said that key wouId work.
-Did you see me try it? Did the door open?
You can't trust Jimmy. He's a criminaI.
I got sick of Iosing every week.
Last year you didn't have
a decent coach. Now you've got me...
and I'm good!
Excuse me, what are you doing?
The key my mother gave me doesn't work.
So we've got to go through a window.
Yeah, wait a minute.
He can't waIk around on my van.
He's going to cave it in.
Can you wait tiII
your mother comes home?
His mother's in the hospitaI and needs her
nightgown or she won't Iet them operate.
It's her Iucky nightgown.
I can't Iet him waIk on my van.
He's too heavy.
I'm not pIaying footbaII,
so we have something in common.
Look, if you get down...
-I'II get up, okay?
-That's fresh!
-That's cooI, man.
-Not cooI.
Get her down. We'II do this Iater.
We do this now, Bird.
It'II take just a minute.
I said we'II come back Iater. Without her.
Oh, my God!
Come on, man, Iet's go!
You better come down, Iady.
HoId on, man.
-Drop.
-I can't!
Lady, come on. I'II catch you. Now, drop!
Oh, my God! What's happening?
-Bird, I'm in a trash can!
-Be quiet.
You want me to be quiet?
I'II teII you what.
-You get my van back.
-No probIem. Now, shut up.
-Get back what I paid for those hubcaps.
-I'II taIk to Maurice. Be quiet.
And you pIay for CentraI
or I start screaming.
Now, Iady, Iook, that pIace beIonged
to the biggest fence in town.
The stuff was aII stoIen. I just wanted
to return it to the rightfuI owners.
-We're in here!
-Are you crazy?
Shut up.
If you pIay footbaII...
my Iips are seaIed.
You know what this is, don't you?
This is extortion.
That's an ugIy charge, Bird.
True, but ugIy.
Right!
Left!
That's the Bird.
I didn't think he'd pIay this year.
Shake that ass!
-I'm here.
-Line up.
It's Iike this. You guys are so pitifuI
that I said, ''Bird, stop these Iosers...
''from embarrassing themseIves
aII over town.''
Street Iife treating you weII?
What's the matter, Bird?
Doesn't crime pay anymore?
So that's it, huh?
I guess I'm not the quarterback anymore?
I guess not.
Did I ever teII you
what a good sIotback I am?
You're hired.
Thanks, Kru.
Way to push through!
You're right, Kru! You're a great sIotback!
AII right, Iast chance.
Rocket, sIot Ieft, A-back post.
It was a great game.
Victory parties sure beat the heII
out of defeat parties, don't they?
I'II go get a drink. When I come back,
you better not be fIirting with anyone.
Don't case my house, okay?
Are you suggesting I'm a criminaI?
You girIs did a great job.
That mascot costume you made
for your dog is a bad motherfucker.
-Thank you.
-Hi, guys. Where are your knapsacks?
Go get them.
Your daddy wiII be here in a minute.
Let's go!
No drinking! Hand it over.
-Coach, it's nonaIcohoIic.
-It's pIenty aIcohoIic.
-I'II take that, Coach.
-No, you won't.
Sorry, homeboy. This is a private party.
Excuse me. Is MoIIy here?
Oh, you mean Coach?
She's right over there.
What's your name and
favorite sexuaI position, sweet thing?
Frank?
-It's nonaIcohoIic.
-I don't want to hear about it.
MoIIy! What's going on here?
Don't be grabbing the coach Iike that!
It's a victory party, Frank.
We won against Dearborn.
Great! Is this how you ceIebrate...
drinking beer with your pIayers?
I wasn't drinking the beer. They were.
I mean, I was taking it away from them.
Fine. I hope this comes out.
You know how UItrasuede stains.
-Daddy!
-Hi, sweetheart!
Peanut gave us drinks,
and said President MuffIey's costume...
was a bad motherfucker.
WeII, it was.
'Bye, Mom. See you Sunday.
Oh, my God!
What the heII's the matter with you?
She's here five days
and you Iet her turn into a Martian!
You didn't think I'd find you?
Hey, Iet go of her!
What are you doing, man?
What happened?
Sweetie, are you aII right?
-Frank, her nose is bIeeding.
-Sweetheart, are you okay?
-You better stay back, aII of you!
-Everybody just stop, okay?
Anybody who messes
with me or my kids gets hurt.
Hey, what's going on?
Frank, what are you doing?
You can't come to my house
and start sIugging peopIe!
-Are you aII right?
-The party must be winding down.
I'm sorry. I thought you were one of them.
I am.
Come on, sweetie.
There you have it.
It'II be okay, sweetheart.
Are you okay, honey?
We'II get an ice pack. Is my hair okay?
Everything was fine untiI you got here.
That's a matter of opinion, MoIIy.
I admit I may have been remiss...
about spending time with my girIs,
but I cannot be remiss about this.
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You'II see.
His Iawyer seems to have said it
pretty succinctIy.
My job is endangering
the safety and weIfare of the chiIdren?
-That's unbeIievabIe.
-Lawyers Iike to write threatening Ietters.
Don't get too upset about it.
Your dad wouId have been proud
to see you now.
This is the game baII
from the Iast game we pIayed together.
WaIt, couId we not taIk about footbaII?
Does Frank have a chance
of getting custody?
I seriousIy doubt it.
Even if they pIay rough and go to court,
it wouIdn't happen for months.
Don't worry. Everything's going to be fine.
Just keep doing what you've been doing.
I understand you've won
three footbaII games in a row.
-I can't Iose my girIs, WaIt.
-Let me worry about that.
You worry about winning footbaII games.
You can serve anytime you're ready.
I'm sorry.
4:00. My court.
MoIIy. Didn't know it was you.
-Anyway, your time's up.
-Mr. Warmth.
I hear your CentraI boys
won their Iast game. CongratuIations.
My CentraI boys won
their Iast three games, thanks.
You haven't pIayed any decent teams.
Wait tiII you pIay McKinIey and LincoIn.
-Wait tiII we go up against Prescott.
-Too bad you're not on our scheduIe.
Assuming you make
the AII-City Championship, that is.
That was good, MoII.
Just remember, you can't win
a pissing contest from a prick.
You know something? This whoIe thing
about Ietting you coach, it wasn't serious.
It was Iike a prank.
Now I'm sorry I had anything to do with it.
You're too thick-headed to reaIize
you're making high-schooI sports...
Iook stupid.
So you won a few games.
You're a Iaughingstock.
You're the joke of Chicago
and you don't even know it.
They say we're a Iaughingstock.
They say we're the joke of Chicago.
Don't get mad. Get even!
<i>U-G-L-Y, and you ain't got no alibi</i>
<i>You ugly. What?</i>
<i>You ugly</i>
<i>You ain't human
Your mama said you ugly</i>
<i>U-G-L-Y, no you ain't got no alibi</i>
<i>You ugly. What?</i>
<i>You ugly!</i>
-I thought you said our deaI was for $5?
-No, sir.
$6 gets you an EngIish paper.
Science papers got diagrams. That's $8.
Make it $7, and you can
cut in front of me at Iunch.
-$7.50, and I get your dessert?
-DeaI.
WiIIiams. $8.
Get out of here. Give it to me.
What is it, History?
How about a nice watch?
What's your momma want? A Crock-Pot?
-Cash.
-How about a nice answering machine?
Remote?
Compact-disc pIayer?
-How do you do? I'm PhiIIip Finch.
-What are you doing, PhiIIip Finch?
Just heIping your young men
satisfy their academic requirements.
-Take a waIk, Finch.
-WaIking.
<i>Your mama says you ugly</i>
AII right. We've got 10 seconds to go.
Get Trumaine in a man-to-man.
Go jet, sIot right, 84 post.
AII right, Iet's go. Go get them!
AII right, CeruIo, you're a genius!
Mr. Ruff, thank you very much.
You reaIIy gave us a run for our money.
-You're a miracIe worker. You did it!
-We're in the pIay-offs!
You did it, Coach. We're number one!
-Two?
-I have no voice.
You are definiteIy off the opera circuit
for at Ieast a week.
Sure that's aII you want?
How about some tapioca pudding?
First, thanks for meeting me.
I know we can taIk this thing out.
This stuff with Iawyers,
and Ietters going back and forth...
who wants it?
I acted rashIy. I'm a big boy, I can admit it.
But you can't bIame me, can you?
Let's not argue, okay?
I didn't come here to argue.
I came to make peace through a IittIe pIan.
MoII, I beIieve Chatham wiII provide
the stabiIity that our girIs need right now.
Stephanie went there. I think
you'II agree she turned out pretty weII.
It's a IittIe on the conservative side...
but it's very forward-thinking, too.
You're going to Iove it.
Every year there's a Greek pageant
where the girIs wear togas...
and read from the works
of PIato, AristotIe, and Socrates.
It's very exciting.
What did you say, dear?
She just yawned, Mrs. Chatham.
She has Iaryngitis.
One of my favorites. I Iove HeracIitus.
Why, of course we can get you
something to eat.
Did Frank teII you about
the rather daring experiment...
we're going to try
in our physicaI education program?
No, I haven't gotten to that part yet.
Jazzercise.
You know, dancing and prancing to jazz?
You can even pick your jazz seIections.
Within reason, of course.
The girIs couId onIy go here if you took
over the physicaI education program.
-What?
-I know how busy you've been...
so I took the burden
of finding a job for you.
I know the guys in the team wiII be upset,
but bIame it on me.
I've got broad shouIders.
You motherfucker!
-What did she say?
-She said she'd think about it.
Hey, AngeIique!
You want me to put
a CeruIo mark on your Iocker?
Do what?
He puts dents in Iockers with his head.
It's his most inteIIigent--
<i>Shut up, Finch. So how about it?
Mucho dents on Bobby's Iocker.</i>
-I wouIdn't do it if I were you, CeruIo.
-I wouId.
Watch this.
Gym Iockers are at Ieast nine inches
Ionger than these.
That resuIts in
a Iower coefficient of rigidity.
-What are you taIking about?
-You wiII faiI to make a dent...
-and you'II probabIy get a concussion.
-$5.
-You, as they say, are on.
-That's good.
CeruIo, I got $5 on you.
Go for it.
He's aII right. He's okay, man.
-He's going down.
-No, he's aII right.
No dent. I win.
Finch, what are you doing?
CeruIo? What happened to CeruIo?
He tried to beat
the Iaws of physics and Iost.
Get the nurse. You'd better be aII right.
-He owes me $5.
-And you owe me one pIayer.
That must be what they mean
by Ietting it aII hang out!
How did your foIks Iet you get Iike this?
Are you kidding? He probabIy ate his foIks.
Coach, you can't be serious
about Ietting him pIay.
If we Iose this game,
we're out of the championships.
At Iast, the voice of reason.
No offense, guys,
but we need some size on the Iine...
-and Finch does have size.
-No way I'm going to pIay...
unIess a suitabIe fee
can be negotiated before gametime.
You are partIy responsibIe
for what happened to CeruIo.
You're going to pIay,
or I'II have you suspended for gambIing.
How about a smaII fee?
Let's get ourseIves into the championship!
Let's go!
<i>Come on, we gotta get on down</i>
<i>Football, get down!</i>
HeIIo, there. Hey, don't mind me.
-Hut!
-It's aII yours.
CaII time-out!
Bird! Time-out! Let's go.
Time-out! Damn it, Finch.
-Coach wants you to the sideIine, man.
-You go on. I'II wait here.
Coach, Finch is pIaying
Iike the other team's paying his fee.
Next pIay, trip his fat capitaIist ass.
Now, teII Peanut.
Okay guys, Iisten up.
We're going to go red right, snake motion,
quarterback draw. On two.
-Ready?
-Break!
How are you enjoying the game thus far?
Hut!
Way to go, Finch!
I'm fIattered you came
to see high schooI baII.
-I wish I couId say I came for the game.
-What's wrong?
Frank got a IittIe hot
about that Chatham SchooI thing.
He's wangIed a hearing.
-God, WaIt, you said that--
-Don't get yourseIf aII upset.
Don't get upset?
That means I have to go to court now?
UnIess you feeI Iike changing your mind
about taking that job at Chatham.
The AII-City League has a ruIe
that pIayers have to maintain...
a C average for eIigibiIity?
I have information from a reIiabIe source
that these CentraI pIayers are ineIigibIe.
Dan, you've opened my eyes
to a very serious probIem.
I have to punch these young men's grades
up on the computer.
We shouId be getting
our computers in, say...
two years?
I guess I'm wasting my time.
I'd heard you were a stickIer for the ruIes,
Iike me.
I don't give a shit if your team's IegaI,
'cause my boys wiII beat you.
I just thought you'd Iike to take action
as a matter of principIe.
What are you Iooking at?
That jacket.
That's a beautifuI jacket,
but there's something missing.
-What?
-An ID badge.
As you know, nobody's aIIowed here
without one. Since you don't have one...
I guess that means that you're not here.
'Cause if you were here...
I'd have to have you arrested.
I am a stickIer for the ruIes.
Do you think you can get away
with treating me Iike this?
Right.
Frank has no case.
The girIs aren't in any danger.
What's he going to say?
''I don't Iike my ex-wife
teaching in the ghetto?''
WaIt says that every time you go to court,
you take a risk.
I can't risk Iosing my girIs.
Then give up. Quit your job here
and teach at Chatham.
You're right on course, Coach.
Straight ahead.
You think I shouId?
I think you've aIready
made up your mind to quit.
The thing is, if you have,
then teII them now.
Good game today, Coach.
Because if you don't,
they'II see it in your face.
<i>We gather tonight...</i>
<i>to celebrate the impending
and inevitable...</i>
<i>All-City Championship...</i>
<i>which will be won
by Prescott High School.</i>
<i>Just a second.</i>
<i>This isn't school spirit l'm hearing, is it?</i>
<i>lf this is school spirit,
l must be in the wrong place.</i>
<i>l thought l was at Central. l'm sorry.</i>
<i>l must be dreaming.</i>
<i>But l'll take full credit for this change...</i>
<i>because it was l alone,
with no help from anyone else...</i>
<i>who hired Coach Molly McGrath.</i>
<i>Whose team, l might hasten to add...</i>
<i>will be wearing new uniform jerseys,
thanks to those of you...</i>
<i>who finally bought
the last of the peanut brittle.</i>
<i>What do you say we get her up here, huh?</i>
<i>Make a path for Coach McGrath!</i>
<i>l feel so lucky...</i>
<i>to have been able to coach...</i>
<i>such a fine football team.</i>
You didn't say that when schooI opened.
<i>We got off to a slow start because--</i>
Because we're a bunch of fuck-ups!
<i>We're having a great season this year.</i>
Next year, we go undefeated.
Right, Coach?
<i>Let's take one season at a time, okay?</i>
<i>You're a great bunch of guys.</i>
<i>So thanks, and--</i>
You haven't taIked Iong enough.
<i>Bird, don't give me a hard time, okay?</i>
No, Coach, I'm serious.
According to this watch,
you've onIy taIked one minute...
<i>32 and 15/100 of a second.
Here, Iook for yourseIf.</i>
Why did you take it out of the box?
<i>What is it?</i>
It's a new car. What's it Iook Iike?
Read the back.
<i>''Coach.</i>
<i>''We owe you. Love from your pussies. ''</i>
Speech! Speech!
<i>l don't know what else to say.
Except l want to see every one of you...</i>
<i>on that field next week
while we're playing against Prescott...</i>
<i>'cause we're going to kick some ass!</i>
What's happening here?
I'm a IittIe wasted on punch.
Are you sure you're aII right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
If your mother sees you Iike this
she's gonna turn your ass...
-the same coIor as your hair.
-Let's take her home.
Time for you to go.
I want to go back to the party.
Marva! Trumaine!
Did you ask your uncIe
before you took his car?
He Iets me drive it any time I want.
Then why did you have to hot-wire it?
-Where's AIice?
-She was around somewhere.
-Coach, how about a ride?
-I have to find AIice.
-Trumaine took her to your house.
-Trumaine?
Verna!
I don't want to got to bed.
It's not my bedtime.
Mom usuaIIy Iets me stay up
tiII 1 :00 or 2:00 or 3:00.
We'II hang around
untiI Coach gets here, okay?
HeIIo, Stephanie, you stick...
get my dad on the phone. I want
to teII him what I think about Chatham.
Frank, sIow down.
You're going to get a ticket
and ruin your perfect driving record.
Do you know state Iaw requires seat beIts
in the front and rear?
Shut up, Finch.
Yeah, honey!
Oh, shit! Every time I....
What are you doing here?
One of us shouId be here
when our daughter is drunk and aIone.
Things aren't aIways as bad as they seem.
And then again,
sometimes they're even worse.
-Hi. How are you aII doing?
-What the heII is going on here?
Trumaine, what is going on?
AIice needed a ride home and we took her.
We were just watching TV
tiII you guys got back.
She's upstairs, sIeeping.
Honey?
HomegirI, what's happening?
This won't be happening at Chatham,
I promise.
You just try to send me to Chatham,
and I'II dye my whoIe face purpIe.
That's it, MoIIy,
I'm not putting up with this anymore.
Outside, Frank.
-I've got it under controI. Let me handIe it.
-That's the joke of the year.
AIice is passed out, you're out partying,
and these two are screwing on your sofa.
We were not!
Not when you came in, we weren't.
Trumaine and Marva...
why don't you go on home now?
Thanks for bringing AIice back.
-You're sure?
-Yeah, take off.
-MoIIy, I'm getting custody of the girIs.
-You don't have to drive me home, Coach.
-You've Iost your grip on reaIity.
-You can pay for a cab.
You've Iost controI of what goes on
in your own house!
$20 shouId do it, maybe $15.
You've got guts gaIore
threatening me with Iosing custody.
I took care of Marian
when she had the croup.
I was the one who comforted AIice
when she had nightmares...
for six months after you Ieft!
I bIew up a house fuII of baIIoons
for your daughter's fourth birthday...
which you didn't even show up at.
Don't teII me that
I've Iost my grip on reaIity!
I can't Iose my grip on reaIity.
I'm submerged up to here in reaIity!
WouId you just stop being so dramatic?
If I didn't think you'd use it against me,
I'd punch your face in.
-I'II do it for $10.
-Keep your fat ass out of this!
No charge.
I can feeI the rotation of the earth.
You're pIastered, AIice.
WaIt, shouIdn't we be whispering, too?
ShouIdn't we be doing something?
We're on our own 10-yard Iine.
We may have to punt, MoIIy.
Don't use footbaII anaIogies now.
TaIk Iike a Iawyer, okay?
The most serious aIIegations
are that your oIder daughter AIice...
was injured in a fight, which occurred
during a party heId at your home...
on the night of September 30...
and that minors were
seen there drinking beer.
And that your oIder daughter
became intoxicated...
at another party attended by you
and was then driven home by a coupIe...
whom your ex-husband saw
having intercourse...
in your Iiving room.
The way they make it sound,
I'd ruIe against me.
The opera isn't over
untiI the fat Iady sings.
What does that mean?
WouId Miss McGrath
care to make a statement...
before I ruIe on this petition?
She wouId, Your Honor.
Just drive straight up the middIe.
Your Honor, AIice and Marian...
are more vaIuabIe to me than anything.
I Iove them very much.
Your Iove for your chiIdren
is not at issue here.
This is a hearing to determine what is best
for the weIfare of the chiIdren.
He says I'm not the best
for my own chiIdren and he's wrong.
Mr. Needham mereIy cIaims...
that Miss McGrath's job
as a footbaII coach at CentraI High...
is jeopardizing the safety and
weII-being of his daughters.
That's not true.
Further, he even tried
to reach a compromise.
He arranged for a job for Miss McGrath
at a very fine schooI...
which their daughters wouId attend.
An offer she rejected with a profanity,
which I won't repeat in court.
Now, wait just a second.
He tried to trick me into quitting
the one thing that I took pride in doing...
in order to teach Jazzercise
to a bunch of overpriviIeged girIs...
so I caIIed him a motherfucker...
which is IinguisticaIIy correct...
because I'm a mother...
and used to....
Your Honor,
I'd Iike to break testimony now...
and introduce into the record
some character witness testimony.
If it's reIevant, I wiII hear the witness.
What are you doing?
-Who's this?
-It's the footbaII team.
Are you aII character witnesses?
We promise to teII the whoIe truth
and nothing but the truth. That's no Iie.
See, Your Honor...
if it pIease the court, it's wrong to take
Marian and AIice away from Coach.
-I wish I had a mother haIf as good as her.
-You wish you had a mother.
This is serious. CeruIo, chiII.
-May I approach the bench?
-Yes.
The point is,
Coach McGrath cost me a Iot of money...
because ever since
I've been pIaying footbaII for her...
I've been totaIIy straight.
She toId us if we fouIed up...
we were off the team.
Any wooI good-Iooking as yourseIf...
shouIdn't be wasting her time.
Easy, pops. Wait your turn.
I'II bet me and you can work this out.
Don't you got a chamber around here
where we can go and--
Mr. Coes, I'm sorry, I don't see
where this testimony is reIevant.
It's reIevant right fucking here.
Order! Order!
You suckers think you're bad?
Keep it up, and I'II hoId you
in contempt of court!
Now, sit down, turkeys!
See what you did, man?
If Miss McGrath persists
in associating with this team...
then petitioner must request
not onIy immediate custody...
but that she forfeit visitation priviIeges
during the footbaII season...
and that the chiIdren be enjoined
from attending games...
or otherwise associating
with team members at any time.
-Further--
-Wait, wait, stop.
AII right, Frank, you win.
Next semester, I quit coaching
and I teach at Chatham.
Now caII this thing off, okay?
Take it quick.
-You jumped out of bounds.
-Shut up.
I can't risk Iosing my girIs.
The pIaintiff accepts respondent's offer.
Ms. McGrath, are you sure
this is what you want?
Yes.
May I Ieave now?
This hearing is cIosed.
-Not too shabby, huh?
-Yeah.
CongratuIations. You did a wonderfuI job.
I'II bring the girIs to the game.
Ms. McGrath, good Iuck tomorrow.
Thanks.
Hey, you guys! I Iooked aII over for you
at the candy counter.
<i>Come on, gotta get on down
Football, get down</i>
<i>Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight</i>
-Damn!
-Hut!
Knock his dick in the dirt!
Coach Goose and her VeIvet Pussies.
I'm a funny guy.
I can't hear you!
Hut!
Hike!
BubbIe his snout!
Come on!
You're aII right, son. Get up.
You got 20 minutes to shake it off.
Peanut?
It's a rough game.
The kids get hurt 'cause they're trained...
for girIs' track, not footbaII.
Why don't you eat shit and die?
-Are you aII right, Peanut?
-As Iong as I don't have to get up, ever.
We're two TDs behind.
We can get them back.
Bird, three times
Trumaine was wide open.
I couIdn't see from
the bottom of the piIe I was under.
You saying something about my bIocking?
Is that what you caII it?
Shut up before I rag your face.
It's nobody's fauIt.
They're champions, and we're diIdos.
-What do you want to do? Quit?
-Why not?
It worked for you.
What's that supposed to mean?
I sent pIays in. You just didn't execute.
I see. This is about yesterday.
Great.
I suppose you think I was chicken shit
for what I did in court, huh?
I suppose you think I got beat
because I was afraid to fight.
Yeah, you do.
You figure if your coach is such a Ioser,
it gives you the right to be Iosers, too.
Doesn't it?
Coach, where you going?
Frank! The deaI's off.
You're not sending our girIs
to some schooI they don't wanna go to...
and you're not
taking them away from me!
And I'm not quitting my job here either.
If that's not okay with you, sue me...
and I'II fight you
aII the way to the Supreme Court.
Don't make her give up the kids, Frank.
Let her have the kids, you worm.
Stay out of this!
I don't want to be a quitter anymore.
I don't want our girIs to see a quitter.
For them...
not for me.
Okay. We'II work it out.
We'II work it out? We'II work it out!
One more condition.
Second haIf, you got to cheer.
-Oh, God.
-Supreme Court, Frank!
I'II cheer. Maybe you'd Iike
to take them for the second haIf.
You bet. Come on, benchwarmers!
-Lady, you our coach?
-Yeah, I'm stiII your coach.
TeII us what to do.
Win, you turkeys!
Hut!
You guys are pitifuI! You're morons!
Turn it out. Let's go!
Line up fast!
-Set!
-Get a hit!
Go! Go!
This is getting to be a reaIIy good game.
Okay, aII right. Great, guys! I Iove you.
AIonzo, you make this point,
every girI in the free worId wiII want you.
Turn it out!
Use those cIeats! Maim them!
I hate footbaII!
Hut!
No probIem.
Hut!
Get him!
Let's go!
AII right! BeautifuI!
Way to go, CentraI! AII right!
You don't reaIIy have to cheer.
It wasn't a court order.
This is a great game.
BIock for the guy!
WiII you bIock for the guy?
Excuse me, Coach.
-Get this guy out of here.
-That's okay. See, I'm not with them.
I won't pIay unIess they pay me.
-Pay you?
-Right. Consider me neutraI.
Get rid of this guy, wiII you?
You want some advice?
You're being humiIiated.
You shouId give up.
Get out of my face, you fat fuck!
Come on, girIs! Come on!
Cover two, Peanut!
I want to pIay, Coach.
-What?
-I want to pIay.
Not now, Finch. Put a hat on, somebody!
I want to pIay.
Yeah, aII right! Watch the screen!
Dawson, sIide down!
Here's $10. Put me in.
Dan, take a Iook. McGrath.
$15?
Finch, put your money away!
-Defense! Defense!
-Come on, WaIt!
They got Iess than a minute.
If they kick a fieId goaI,
Prescott's ahead 24 to 21 ...
aII the yeIIing's not going to heIp.
Time!
You miss this kick,
you'II be running Iaps for Iife. Now, move.
-It's not over tiII the gun sounds!
-Right on!
Defense! Defense!
Get your body between the baII
and the goaI post.
Go on.
-What are you doing?
-Here's the $15 I owe you.
Get out there!
She's putting that fat guy in.
<i>Keep that super spirit up</i>
<i>You gonna stomp tonight
Hey, hey, hey</i>
I Iove my guys. BeautifuI.
A fineIy-trained kiIIing machine.
Hut!
My God!
Go, baby!
Run, Bird.
That fat guy got paid! I protest!
-Good game, man.
-This is not over. That guy got paid!
-Good game, Dan.
-This isn't over. She paid him!
Are you crazy?
He's probabIy got the money on him now.
Search his pockets!
A footbaII uniform doesn't have pockets.
-It's in his jock!
-Oh, my God.
-Search his jock!
-I'm not searching his jock.
-Search his jock!
-I'm not searching his jock.
-Then you're off the team.
-I'm a senior. No probIem.
I'II do it myseIf!
If you're searching his jock,
I'd rather you'd shake my hand first.
It's in here somewhere! I saw it!
Let me down,
you pea-brained son of a bitch!
Finch, put him down.
Not untiI he shakes
your hand Iike a gentIeman.
I'II never shake her hand!
If he doesn't want to shake my hand,
then he doesn't have to. It's okay.
Do you wish to be a hand shaker
or a shot put?
Thanks, Dan.
Okay, Finch, you can put him down now.
AII the way down!
Come on, Coach, it's party time.
We gonna get down tonight!
Not at my house!
