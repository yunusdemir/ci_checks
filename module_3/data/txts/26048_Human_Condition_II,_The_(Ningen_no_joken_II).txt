PART 3
- All's in order, sir!
- Good.
Attention!
All's in order, sir!
- Good.
Salute!
At ease.
JANUARY 23RD - 20:00 HOURS
32° BELOW ZERO
Here he comes.
You recruits
are feigning sleep, eh?
You can't rest
until I've made my rounds.
All seems to be in order.
Recruits, fall in!
Turn on the light.
Legs apart
and grit your teeth.
Idiots!
Did that hurt?
- No, sir!
Good.
I'll teach you dogs a lesson!
Fools!
You know what that was for?
What about you?
- I dunno.
- What?
I don't know, sir!
You don't?
Well, I'll show you.
It was for this.
Since when do you use
the water tank as an ashtray?
Speak up!
The duty officer specifically
ordered that those tanks
be kept clean and sanitary.
We received the order.
Who was on duty today?
Step forward!
Remove your glasses.
Get up!
Obara refilled the tanks
before evening mess.
I removed the ash trays
after "lights out."
You're implying that one of your
superiors smoked after "lights out"?
Kaji, are you trying to pin blame
on a senior serviceman?
No. I only said that Obara
showed no neglect.
Watch your language!
Recruit Obara
admits his neglect.
Of course.
Why didn't you say so?
- I'm very sorry.
- You should be.
- I'll be more careful.
- It's too late for that!
Owaku, where are you going?
To change the water.
You don't have to do that.
Kaji, you dare talk back
to PFC Bannai?
I didn't talk back.
The platoon leader
demands discipline!
Who taught you
to be insubordinate?
Your friend Shinjo over there?
Logic won't get you
anywhere in this army.
Don't try acting big around here
just because you went to college.
Any arguments?
PFC Bannai,
leave this to me.
Very well.
You, report to me later!
Can't you even see
the target?
I can.
Then your heart isn't in it.
Take careful aim.
Imagine it's the enemy out there.
Come on, Obara.
Hit it, please!
Draw a bead carefully
onto the target
at the bottom of the bull's -eye.
Hold your breath!
Apply pressure on the trigger
and squeeze gently.
You idiot!
No luck.
We'll never get
to lunch at this rate.
And always
because of him!
- It can't be helped.
- Shut up, you hick.
That's no excuse.
What's going on over there?
Stop acting
like starved mongrels.
Kaji!
Show Obara how to do it.
Yes, sir!
Unstack arms.
Show him you can hit
the target with eyes closed.
- With eyes closed?
- That's right.
With proper posture,
you should at least hit the target.
Objective - the target!
Position - prone!
Obara, watch how he holds it
and squeezes the trigger.
You see, Obara?
Bad eyesight is no excuse.
Try again.
Obara, try to relax.
Don't jerk the trigger.
Squeeze down on it.
Squeeze it slowly.
Slowly now...
You'd be better off dead!
You're a disgrace
to the whole Kwangtung Army!
Obara, listen carefully.
A sense of responsibility
is a soldier's life.
A grenade could wipe out your squad
because of your missed shot.
Show some responsibility
and some shame!
To the target
on the double!
Kaji, you go with him.
Bayonet attack!
Charge!
Down!
Obara, stop crying!
Forward!
<i>"A t the time,</i>
<i>Kaji was trying to save</i>
<i>the lives</i>
<i>of innocent Chinese.</i>
<i>This earned him the hatred</i>
<i>of the</i> Kenpeitai.
<i>They arrested him</i>
<i>and grilled him mercilessly.</i>
<i>If my husband</i>
<i>had indeed been guilty,</i>
<i>they would not have released him</i>
<i>after just 20 days.</i>
<i>I fervently hope that</i>
<i>this unfortunate incident...</i>
<i>will not compromise his position</i>
<i>as a member of your unit.</i>
<i>As the wife of a recruit,</i>
<i>I address this appeal to you.</i>
<i>The life of a recruit</i>
<i>under suspicion</i>
<i>would be a living hell</i>
<i>with no salvation."</i>
Orderly!
Where's the orderly?
<i>Entering, sir!</i>
Your orderly, sir!
Call Warrant Officer Hino.
Salute the warrant officer!
Present arms!
Eyes front!
PFC Yamazaki now relieved
of guard duty, sir.
Good.
Thank you for your work!
Knock it off!
See to your own duties.
Thank you.
We're very grateful.
Anything you need washed?
That's all right.
You're a hard worker, Kaji.
I hated laundry duty
even more than beatings.
One might hate it,
but there's no avoiding it.
You won't be a private
forever like me.
You're tops among the recruits.
But don't forget:
You're under suspicion.
I know.
They can't afford to have
a Red leading the pack.
They're hoping
you'll make a misstep.
You and I can't even talk
without being watched.
Anything suspicious
about Kaji's actions?
Have you received reports
to that effect?
I asked if you had.
None, sir, though I have him
under surveillance.
What are Sergeant Hashitani's
thoughts?
He's giving Kaji
special sniper training now, sir.
- He's a good marksman?
- An unerring eye, sir.
- And his barracks discipline?
- Excellent, sir.
How is he with Shinjo?
They seem close, but -
Seem? You don't know?
They're both blacklisted
by the <i>Kenpeitai.</i>
They have no time now
to do any plotting.
Why's that?
I've kept Shinjo on constant
supply transport and guard duty.
Keep an eye on them.
They'll soon show
their true colors.
If they straighten up,
they could be our best soldiers.
Attention!
At ease.
Listen as you are.
Afternoon training
is canceled.
There'll be
an arms inspection.
The tiniest speck of dust
will not be tolerated.
After dark there'll be
sentry training,
followed by
attack training at dawn.
What do you think?
Like the full schedule?
Owaku, you have a letter.
Kaji.
Obara.
Corporal Shibata.
- Salute!
Arms inspection again?
From your wife?
Read it out loud.
No, I save it
till I can't bear it any longer.
Oh, well.
You must have a good wife.
I wonder what that wench
of mine is up to.
Hey, Obara.
Think things will get better
after basic?
It won't be this rough
much longer.
I'm getting fed up.
Don't let little things
get you down.
Little things, eh?
Bad news from home
bothering you?
My mother and wife
are fighting as usual.
My wife's threatening
to leave home.
Doesn't mean she's leaving you.
You wouldn't understand.
You've had all the breaks.
It would leave
my aging mother all alone.
Back one and drop the other.
To back 'em both
is asking for trouble.
That's the wrong one.
Take it out.
You broke it.
You weren't paying attention.
You fool!
That was mine!
What are you gonna
do about it?
I'm not apologizing
to the army for you.
That won't fix your rifle, Kubo.
Forgive him.
- No, I won't!
- Then don't.
You stay out of this.
Everybody here knows
you're a Red.
And so?
I'm just saying
no one loves a Red.
Hit me.
Hit me all you want.
Attention!
Eyes right!
Front!
- All right, they're ready.
- Thank you!
Start distributing.
- Is there a Private Shinjo here?
- Yes, one.
Private Shinjo will take two recruits
and clean out the latrines.
Good luck.
On whose orders?
Sergeant Soga's.
He sets up the roster
for latrine duty too?
Quit your griping, Shinjo.
Is a three-year man
too good to clean latrines?
Tell the NCO on duty
or Warrant Officer Hino
that I'll do it alone.
I don't need help
from any recruits.
Shinjo...
better take somebody along.
It ain't easy
cartin' all that shit alone.
Will none of you recruits
go with him?
Kaji, why don't you go?
You're another Red shit
like him.
Kubo, come with us.
I don't take orders from you.
That's it, fight it out.
The liquor will be here soon.
Come on, one more!
Get moving.
Recruit Kaji to latrine duty!
Recruit Tanoue to latrine duty!
That's the spirit!
They're giving you and me
all the dirty work.
Standing duty the other night,
I suddenly realized
how haggard you looked.
You've been
on constant duty.
You have stamina, Kaji.
I've about had it.
They're just waiting for me
to cave in under the pressure.
<i>Salute!</i>
- All is in order.
- Good.
A huddle in the latrine?
A truly stinking discussion.
Sir...
does the company commander
approve all duty assignments?
I wouldn't know.
Ask WO Hino.
I'll do that.
One more question.
What happens if a soldier
refuses an assignment?
When such assignment
is unfair, of course.
I suggest you check
the Army Penal Code.
Aren't you asking for trouble?
I don't care
about going home,
but I do want
to get out of here.
What do you mean?
I'm not even sure myself.
To go to some unknown place
and get a fresh start.
Someplace where
no one knows me.
Is there such a place?
Escaping from here
only means immediate recapture.
There's only
one other possibility.
Is the border close?
Not far.
But it's all marshland
up to the lake.
Get bogged down there
and you're finished.
Which would you choose?
The land where people
are promised freedom...
or the land where
your loving wife awaits you?
I promised my wife
we'd start a new life together.
You really believe
you'll get back alive?
I don't know...
but I hope so.
<i>A rare Sunday leave</i>
<i>Walking down the boulevard</i>
<i>With her hairdo</i>
<i>of a married woman</i>
<i>She led me up the stairs</i>
<i>To a tiny little room</i>
<i>" You're a wisteria</i>
<i>dangling above</i>
<i>And I'm a lily below"</i>
<i>Just five minutes</i>
<i>To get back to barracks</i>
<i>"Come on, let me go!"</i>
<i>No time to take a train</i>
<i>No money for a cab</i>
<i>With my legs strong</i>
<i>from daily drills</i>
<i>I'll make a run for it</i>
PFC Yoshida!
There's to be a transfer.
A transfer?
They can't toss us out of here
after four years' service.
They've already decided
who it is.
Who?
Kaji, got a copy
of the Penal Code?
Don't let them get to you.
What's the Penal Code for,
Shinjo?
What did you tell him just now?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
A senior serviceman addressed you
and you didn't reply?
Sir, have I done
something wrong?
That's better.
What did you say?
Use your head.
We're celebrating today.
A beating could hurt.
I mentioned that he seemed tired
and shouldn't be reading.
Hear that?
Telling a three-year man
what to do.
So the old veteran
Shinjo is tired, eh?
Hey, Shinjo!
Sorry to fatigue you even more,
but may I trouble you with a question?
It seems he didn't hear you.
I'll clean out his ears!
A fight means trouble
for us both, Yoshida.
I was reading the Penal Code
at Sergeant Soga's suggestion
to learn how to refuse an order
without being insubordinate.
<i>Attention!</i>
<i>Attention!</i>
Salute!
At ease.
What happened?
It's Private Shinjo, sir.
He was taken suddenly ill.
I put him to bed.
Does a feverish man
account for broken bowls?
Pick up these pieces.
Salute!
<i>Cherry tree</i>
<i>the color of my lapel</i>
<i>Your blossoms are scattered</i>
<i>all over Mount Yoshino</i>
<i>If you're born a man</i>
<i>in old Yamato</i>
<i>You must fall like a blossom</i>
<i>at the battle front</i>
It's ridiculous for a lady
to come out here.
There's no place
for you to stay.
What will you do?
I only wanted to see him.
I had no other concern.
The next train out
is tomorrow afternoon.
Will you sleep outdoors?
Or spend the night
walking home?
If you'll only let me see him,
I'm willing to walk back.
Recruit Tanoue
leaving to polish his boots!
Is Kaji here?
Report to the office.
You have a visitor.
- A visitor?
- Who is it?
A dame, no less!
Son of a bitch!
Better hurry up, Kaji,
or someone might swipe her.
Don't be bashful.
Better hurry up.
I'll finish up for you.
Recruit Kaji
reporting to the office!
Make sure you come back.
Damn! Coming all the way
out here to get laid!
Permission to enter, sir!
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Entering, sir!
Recruit Kaji reporting!
You wanted something?
What did you want?
Recruit Kaji, leaving!
Hold it there.
You're a disgrace
to military discipline.
Don't let your wife
make you homesick.
You're hereby authorized
to spend the night with your wife
within the confines
of the company storeroom.
I finally had to come.
It's so far.
How did you make it?
I've changed, haven't I?
It must be rough.
I'm used to it now.
But winter makes things tougher.
We went hunting today.
I'll bring some of the meat later.
You haven't lost any weight.
I'm relieved.
You've come all this way,
and there's so little I can offer you.
I'm just a recruit.
Look at me.
I am.
You mustn't worry.
I'll come through it all right.
How much time
did they give us?
Until morning.
Even less than when
they shipped me off.
So...
it's all right then?
<i>Entering!</i>
Recruit Sasa
with our squad leader's meal!
Ma'am...
Kaji bagged this game
for us today.
Eat heartily
and enjoy yourselves.
Thanks.
My husband is
much indebted to you.
We recruits
are all in the same boat.
The army's one helluva place.
But Kaji's a lucky devil.
No other woman would come
way out here to see her man.
That's the truth.
There's so little time.
I hope it's not too much...
but would you write my wife
and tell her
to do like you
and come out to see me?
All she does
is eat and sleep.
She cares
about nothing else.
Tell her that things
are rough out here
and to bring lots of gifts
for the senior servicemen.
Ride her good!
Recruit Sasa leaving!
Come on. Let's eat.
A rookie allowed
to monkey around with his wife!
The army sheds bitter tears!
Kaji, you're a sneaky one,
keeping all the good things
for yourself.
I request this favor.
He wants blankets.
Your wife should keep you warm.
Aren't your own blankets enough?
They are. I'll make do.
Rolling around on a narrow futon.
Curse the blasted luck!
As long as we're alive,
we'll be able to meet again.
I came here confident
that I'd get to see you.
Even after you left, that
Sergeant Watai kept coming by.
Wanted me to let him
read your letters.
Nasty man! Maybe he thinks
you're planning to desert.
What would you do if I did?
Where would you go?
Across the border.
There's a man
in my squad named Shinjo.
After three years,
he's still a private.
His brother was arrested
for communist leanings.
Even his girlfriend
sold him out.
He claims there's a better world
beyond that border.
A better world?
Where they treat people
like human beings.
And you intend to escape
there all by yourself?
You can't run away!
Not while you still have me!
The warrant officer said
you were a top soldier,
but you're still
under suspicion, aren't you?
I won't go.
I won't run away.
I'll carry on here.
Please don't run away.
Come back to me.
All is in order!
You are relieved.
Assuming duty.
Forward...
march!
Break step!
Don't forget your promise
to come back alive.
I won't forget.
Aren't you sleepy?
Not a bit.
There wasn't anything else
you wished to say?
No.
Even if there were,
I couldn't express it in words.
I'm always thinking
I must tell you about this,
mustn't forget to tell you that.
Me too.
Thanks for coming to see me.
It's only natural.
Thank you
for such a wonderful night.
Don't thank me.
There's so little I can do.
Let's hope we never spend such
a wretched yet beautiful night again.
Maybe it's because...
you're headed for the front.
Why do you say that?
I just have
this strange feeling.
Maybe that's why
they let me see you.
No, you must come back to me!
You have to!
Will you grant me one last favor?
Anything. Just ask.
I came here for your sake.
I realize it's cold...
but I'd like you to undress
and stand over by that window.
I must see you... all of you.
I want to burn that image
into my mind.
I have nothing to offer you!
Nothing!
Please take me!
<i>Reveille!</i>
What's wrong, Kaji?
All worn out?
Bastard!
Come on, Kaji.
I'll give you a workout.
I'm not as easy to poke
as your wife. Come on!
I'm ready!
Enough!
Well done, Kaji.
PFC Yoshida...
you let this recruit
push you around?
Let's have
another round like that.
I'm ready!
Don't retreat, Kaji.
Retreat is no way to victory.
I'm right here.
Come at me!
What is it?
I can't see you off.
We're leaving on maneuvers.
Be careful on your way back.
Time to part once again.
Thank you for coming.
Hurry and go.
I can't bear it.
Let's not say "good-bye",
all right?
A soldier's will before departing should
convey his resolution to his family
and inspire them to carry on
in a fitting way.
What does a departing soldier's
resolution imply? Speak up.
It means to lay down one's life
for one's country.
You parrot back
the right answer,
but what did you write
in your letter?
"Driving you crazy," eh?
"So worried that I could
never face death" - was that it?
Coward! I've never seen a worse
soldier in ten years of service!
Obara admits his fault, sir.
That's not the answer
your commander seeks!
Such effeminate ideas are more
harmful than Red propaganda.
Even a Red will fight bravely
when the time comes,
but your kind
surrenders before fighting.
WO Hino...
see that he writes
to his wife again.
Let him reaffirm his resolution.
<i>" Tomie...</i>
<i>your thinking</i>
<i>is completely mistaken.</i>
<i>It's the duty</i>
<i>of a Japanese wife</i>
<i>to look after her mother-in-law</i>
<i>in her husband's absence.</i>
<i>Please consider</i>
<i>how your endless complaining</i>
<i>interferes with</i>
<i>the performance of my duties.</i>
<i>I'm very busy here.</i>
<i>Your bickering with my mother</i>
<i>hinders me in my training.</i>
<i>It's my wish that you look</i>
<i>after my mother,</i>
<i>but if you feel this</i>
<i>to be impossible,</i>
<i>I must ask you</i>
<i>to leave my house."</i>
Buck up, Obara!
We're only halfway there!
Come on!
Regulate your breathing!
This march ends your basic training.
Don't disgrace the whole squad!
Obara, don't give up!
Come on! Keep going!
Somebody help him
with his pack.
What kind of buddies
are you?
Very well! I'll help him.
You gonna let that happen?
Can you hold up
your heads up if I do?
Lance Corporal, sir!
- I'll help him.
- Good! Compassion for a buddy.
But if he still drops out, leave him.
A cart will pick him up.
Give me your blanket,
pick, shovel, and tent.
You can handle the rest, right?
Sorry, Kaji. Forgive me.
Hurry up!
Let me rest a while.
Your pack is 20 pounds lighter.
You don't need a rest!
You go on ahead.
I don't want you dropping out
on my account.
Shut up and walk!
Quit now and all you've suffered
will have been in vain.
We're almost done with basic.
Show some guts for once!
Obara, get up!
Get up, Obara!
It's no use.
Leave me behind.
I can't go on.
You'd let my help
be for nothing?
Think what the senior soldiers
will do to you, you fool!
It's no use.
Then to hell with you!
Be a quitter!
I'm going on!
Hate me all you want.
You quit before the fight was over.
But I won't quit!
You hear? I'm going!
A bit fatigued,
honorable recruits?
Bastard!
- Back a bit early, aren't you?
- Get up!
We've been waiting
for you wretched dogs!
All you think about is food!
Stand up!
Stupid dog!
Pull yourself together!
Give 'em a shower!
Worthless scum!
Anyone who rides back
on a cart isn't a man!
Don't you dogs have any balls?
If not, we can find a use for you.
Right, Obara?
Keep those fingers straight!
Get behind the gun rack
and call out for customers.
"Hey, handsome,
come on inside."
Go on.
Move it!
Show us how it's done.
<i>The honorable Shosuke Obara</i>
<i>What made the man go broke</i>
<i>He loved his morning baths,</i>
<i>morning chasers and morning lays</i>
<i>It finally wore the poor man out</i>
Get on with it.
Hey, mister,
come in and have some fun.
Absolutely no sex appeal!
Hey, handsome,
come on inside.
That's it.
Now beckon with your hands.
Say, handsome,
come inside.
- Any takers for the lady?
- That's one I'd rather not mount.
Here's a customer.
Come on, keep it up!
Come on inside, handsome.
Want me to come in?
I haven't gotten any
in a long time.
No objections
to me buying this one?
We appreciate the business!
You stinkin' shit!
You dog!
In the infantry, we don't ride home
like a bunch of whores!
We walk! You got that?
You should be grateful.
We never had it this easy!
You scum!
Worthless shit!
Why don't you go kill yourself?
Just returning
the book I borrowed.
Get up!
Mind if I go to the latrine?
Don't be a fool!
You're on duty.
You're dead if they catch you.
Say I'm patrolling outside.
Do whatever you want.
We all have to die...
sometime.
Is that a sign
that I shouldn't?
Yes! After all,
one can die at any time.
Does that give you
something to think about?
On your feet!
Attention!
Your morals are putrid!
You're like a bunch
of stinking women!
This quitter
who committed suicide...
wasn't the only one
at fault here.
It proves you're all rotten.
When did I ever train you
to be like that?
What about it?
If you feel I didn't
train you right, speak up!
All right. Dismissed.
Do we stand guard
over the corpse?
He's dead now.
He was a human being, after all.
That dog Obara jinxed us
to the very end!
Say that again!
What's wrong?
Why so worked up?
Will you back me?
Don't do it. They're all
on edge over Obara's suicide.
You should have done it yesterday.
- Then why did you stop me?
Would you have stood a chance
if you'd intervened?
I won't involve you,
but I'll see this through.
Sir, I demand that
PFC Yoshida be punished.
Demand?
That's no way
to address your superiors.
Are you aware
of the personal punishment
he inflicted
upon Obara yesterday?
I am not.
Not even a private 1st class
is authorized
to inflict such personal
punishment upon a recruit.
But yesterday -
Hold it there!
Only dogs inform on others.
I'm not informing.
I'm demanding punishment.
Suicide is contrary
to military discipline.
No matter the reason,
there's no excuse.
Was Yoshida's action
in accord with military discipline?
Forcing a helpless recruit
to mimic a common harlot?
Silence!
You dog!
Regardless of what
Yoshida did,
this is all pure speculation
on your part.
I don't claim
it was the only reason...
but it was the final
humiliating blow.
Listen carefully.
A false step now
could ruin your whole life.
I'm not concerned about myself.
What do you intend to do?
If you fail to adopt
appropriate measures, I shall -
Spit it out!
It may be unwise,
but there's no other way.
I'll be forced
to take action myself.
You plan to make trouble, eh?
A personal feud could mean
a stiff term in the guard house.
I won't be there alone.
Sir...
please convey
to PFC Yoshida
that he'd better
watch out for Kaji.
So you're implying that I indirectly
caused my husband's death?
I can't honestly say otherwise.
I understand.
If only I hadn't
written that letter.
It sounds cruel, but it's true.
I'm in a similar position.
I let him drop out
during our march.
To help him walk would have
meant dropping out myself.
If only I had quit with him -
The army recognizes no such reason
for shirking one's duty.
When one drops out,
what happens to him?
Please ask
the warrant officer.
Quitters are the dredges of the military,
a disgrace to their company.
Then my husband's suicide
has doubled his shame?
I had hoped
you'd understand.
Are there special ways
of handling men who drop out?
No, nothing specific.
However, their promotions
are delayed.
I just can't believe it!
My husband wasn't the type
to do such a thing.
There must have been
some reason.
Won't you tell me the truth?
A demoralized home front
is the main reason.
Good soldiers only come
from wholesome families.
I wouldn't probe too deeply.
Please try to see it like this.
A part of Obara died due to your
feuding with your mother-in-law.
Another part died
when I deserted him.
What was left -
That's enough!
You're dismissed.
Recruit Kaji leaving!
Is it true you're contemplating revenge
on a superior out of personal enmity?
Answer me!
I have not breached
military discipline,
but PFC Yoshida has.
It's unfair
to question me first.
You scum!
Is that any way
to address the commander?
It's all right.
Let him speak.
Go ahead.
He inflicted unauthorized personal
punishment of a vile nature
after Obara dropped out
from sheer fatigue.
I only ask
why this goes unpunished.
- You were given an A in marching?
- Yes, sir.
- How were you treated that day?
- Very well, sir.
- Did Yoshida harass you?
- No, sir.
Would he have
if you had dropped out?
I believe so, sir.
- Was Obara the only man punished?
- There were three men, sir.
- All by Yoshida?
- No, by others too.
Did all three commit suicide?
No, sir.
- Just Obara?
- Yes, sir.
Then why do you
single out Yoshida?
Because Obara killed himself.
But I'm ready to press charges
against the others too.
Silence!
It's clear you're out to get Yoshida
and cause disorder in the unit.
Obara's death
is merely an excuse.
By blaming a superior
for a weak soldier's suicide,
you undermine
our finest military traditions.
I do not blame
PFC Yoshida alone.
His actions only revealed
the absurdity of conditions here.
That's why I demand
his punishment.
Obara's death was not caused
by domestic troubles.
Then what did cause it?
With your eloquence,
I'm sure you can explain.
Tell me.
Answer me!
The basic cause...
is the military itself.
You'd make a good private 1st class
if you'd shut up!
Hashitani,
teach him a lesson.
That's enough.
I'll warn you again:
Personal feuds are forbidden.
Violations will be treated
as insubordination.
All right. You may go.
Recruit Kaji leaving!
That one has guts.
His type make good soldiers.
WO Hino, I want him kept
on the promotions list.
- Keep him on, sir?
- Yes.
Make sure
he's well up on the list.
As his stars increase,
his ideas will change.
Men are like springs.
The more pressure,
the stronger they snap back.
It's best not to drive
his kind too hard.
Put him on duty with the vets.
We're headed for the border
in a few days anyway.
Thank you
for your trying duties.
When did you come out here?
Today. Half the guard's
being replaced.
They keeping you out here?
Practically nothing
but sentry duty.
That's just like WO Hino.
I admit it's effective.
I've about had it.
It's damn hot.
Take care of yourself.
They're wrong if they think
they can wear me down.
What's that scoundrel
Yoshida up to?
Don't do anything rash.
They're just waiting for an excuse
to send you to prison.
So this is the real border!
You gonna try?
You coming along?
To the land of promise?
What'll you do over there?
That depends on them.
You believe unconditionally that
true freedom can be found over there?
Not unconditionally.
It's all relative.
What use do they have
for a deserter?
You'd be a mere tool.
A little tool in the service
of their big promises.
You doubt
that all races are equal?
I just don't share
the same naive certainty.
What have the Japanese done?
Deserting the ranks
of the invader
doesn't prove the purity
of your ideals.
You're still just a deserter.
What are you trying to say?
Prettier flowers
blossoming on their soil...
doesn't justify
rejecting your own.
I could never do it.
This is WO Hino!
You hear me?
Send Kaji back immediately.
We need him for the intramural
shooting match in two days.
Got that? What?
I see.
They may not have plans to desert,
but the danger definitely exists.
They were seen whispering
together again last night.
Obara's death is shame enough
for this company.
Have Shinjo transferred out
at the first opportunity.
A signal flare!
It's close by!
Not that close.
Yes, it is.
Let's pick up a few merit points.
Come on.
I don't see anything.
You sure?
Might be farther away.
Damn!
Who goes there?
Stop or I'll shoot!
He was fishing.
You scared him and he ran off.
Does that prove
he's innocent?
Son of a bitch!
You shot off that flare!
Confess!
I didn't!
I was just out fishing!
Please spare us!
He was really just fishing.
Shinjo, don't just stand there.
Take him to the guard post.
But if he's not the culprit -
Fool!
We'll make him the culprit.
That's ridiculous!
Do as I order you!
Forgive us!
Spare us!
What are you doing?
No, don't! No!
Thanks for your troubles!
Kaji!
- There's mail from your wife.
- You've lost weight!
Have I?
I'm being sent out next week.
Was it rough?
Generally it shouldn't be
too bad.
Three letters in three weeks.
Oh, and...
Obara's widow sent a letter
to the entire squad.
What did she write?
She apologized for everything.
She also says
the dead have no tongue,
and she can't find out the truth
about Obara's suicide. Right?
What's that scoundrel
Yoshida doing?
<i>Five men for work duty!</i>
At the storeroom.
One, two, three, four -
still one short!
Kaji?
Obara would have made it five,
PFC Yoshida!
<i>Yoshida!</i>
Shinjo's been called up before
WO Hino for letting a spy escape.
Long time no see, Kaji.
You know your buddy's going to prison?
You're a disgrace
to the Imperial Army!
Bannai shot the culprit anyway,
so I'll let you off with the guard house.
I knew you'd end up there
sooner or later.
<i>Fire call!</i>
<i>Prairie fire!</i>
Prairie fire!
Let's go!
Fan out to the right!
Move back to the left flank!
What the hell are you doing?
Move forward!
Careful, sir!
Hold your ground!
Move forward!
Start a backfire!
Retreat! Everyone retreat!
Fall back!
Retreat!
Fall back!
Form a fire line
where you are!
Stop!
Who's that?
Shinjo.
Deserter!
Sir, a deserter!
It's Shinjo, sir!
Cut that grass!
Kaji, wait!
It's too dangerous! Stop!
Shinjo!
Shinjo, run for it!
Help me, Kaji!
Help me!
Yoshida, I'll save you
if you'll make me a promise.
Can you hear me?
Admit to the CO that you made
Obara commit suicide.
Can you hear me?
You're a lucky man.
You probably remember nothing.
We've shot you full of camphor.
I'm afraid it was too late
for the other man.
He had hemorrhagic fever.
You were talking
in your sleep,
calling for Shinjo
and a Michiko.
Your sweetheart?
Or your wife?
Both.
Who's been changing
my bedpan?
Don't worry about that.
Just try to rest.
- Private Ishii?
- Yes.
- How many years of service?
- Three.
Well, you're not getting
away with it!
Hey, medic...
didn't you ever learn
how to treat patients?
How long have you been in?
Three years,
and still a private.
You may be a lance corporal,
but don't try pulling rank.
What?
The slob took sputum
from a TB patient to get shipped out.
Punishment should be
per regulations.
We don't need people shouting
in the middle of the night here.
Private Tange, eh?
Very well.
We'll see who has the last laugh.
PRIVATE TANGE
Don't overexert yourself.
They'll have you up
and working soon anyway.
No point rushing things.
Patients get work detail too?
A rookie, eh?
Have a seat.
What was your profession,
Honorable Veteran?
Forget the "honorable veteran" stuff.
I was a latheman,
and a good one.
Weren't you guys
exempted from service?
There are some guys
it's safer to keep in the army.
Is that right?
Yes, it is.
<i>You there!</i>
Since when
did you start walking?
No one does anything here
without authorization.
I'm practicing my walking,
nurse.
Hon. Head Nurse!
Sorry, Hon. Head Nurse!
I was practicing walking.
What's so funny?
Lance Cpl. Minakami...
this ward lacks discipline.
Army hospitals
aren't playgrounds.
Tighten things up!
Try that again
and you've had it.
They say Roosevelt's in Russia
talking to Stalin.
If Germany surrenders,
that leaves only Japan.
Yes, the end is drawing near.
But if the Russians
enter the war -
<i>Kaji.</i>
Private Tange's being
sent back to his unit.
When?
Tomorrow.
That's terrible.
It's bad news, isn't it?
Sent back to his unit, eh?
No one can ever know
what will happen tomorrow.
Your unit's been ordered
to the front.
They'll probably keep you here
on hospital duty.
Really?
Even in here, there's always
more bad news than good.
There was so much
I wanted to discuss with you.
We'll meet again somewhere.
You can always meet
those you really wish to.
Someone once told me
that true human beings
will always find kindred spirits.
You're proof of that.
Don't give me too much credit.
But I appreciate your words.
More work for you.
Writing to your wife?
But I don't dare write the truth.
Because of the censors?
Not just that.
Everything I write
ends up as a half-truth.
I want her to know
how Ionely I am,
but I don't want to worry her.
What's more,
as much as I detest army life,
I actually want to stay here
as long as I can.
Is it that nice here?
There are things here
you don't get at the front.
For instance?
For instance...
talking to you.
And now... stay back.
The steam is hot.
Is it all right
for you to be here?
I probably shouldn't be.
Nurse Tokunaga,
why did you leave your post?
What's the meaning
of this misconduct?
A rendezvous in broad daylight -
while on duty!
Rendezvous?
Forgive me,
but there's been no misconduct.
I asked Nurse Tokunaga
to assist me.
A patient issuing orders
to a nurse?
That's as bad
as a rendezvous!
Hon. Head Nurse,
I came of my own accord.
No excuses!
Get back to your post!
As you are outside my authority,
I shall report this to your superiors.
It seems I repaid
your kindness with injury.
You're being sent
to the front because of me.
It's all right.
We had to part
sooner or later.
We may even meet again
somewhere.
I believe we will,
whatever the odds.
You can always meet
those you really wish to.
PART 4
Class-A fortifications
with log-barrel cannons.
Must be the
"scarecrow strategy."
This stinks!
Five years' artillery training,
and they give us peashooters.
Let's put that one
to old Commander Yamada.
<i>Attention!</i>
Is there a Private Kaji
in this squad?
Yes, sir.
It's been a long time, Kaji.
So you're still alive?
At ease!
I am 2nd Lt. Kageyama.
I'm taking over your training
as of today.
Who goes there?
Who goes there?
Firefly.
Snow.
Sounds of gun tractors
or tanks for 10 minutes.
Otherwise all is in order, sir.
Good work.
What's that?
Probably a festival.
They shot off fireworks.
Doesn't make sense.
The fighting in Europe
must have ended.
Germany must have surrendered.
A new batch of recruits
arrives soon.
I want you to assist me
in their training.
In what way?
The new men range
from 20 to 44 years old.
Half active service,
the remainder untrained.
Artillery men are a rough bunch.
They'd tear these men to shreds.
Basic is like that anywhere.
That's why I need your help.
Count me out.
I told you I gave up
guarding the army's sheep.
I've reported that you're
my assistant in the rifle squad.
I'll see that you make
private 1st class.
Think you can bait me
with a promotion?
No, I know I can't.
I just figured you could
spare those recruits a lot of grief.
Need I say more?
I'll accept your proposal...
on one condition.
What's that?
I want radical changes
in squad composition.
And the training officer
has agreed
to separate the recruits
from the veterans?
He has.
Hon. Squad Leader, if you approve,
the company commander will as well.
Sure it's not just to keep
the veterans off your own back?
That's part of it,
but not all.
Many of the new untrained recruits
are in their 40s.
Excessively rough treatment
in the barracks
would make it difficult
for them to learn anything.
From my own days in basic
I remember one case of suicide.
It's our duty
to weed out such weaklings.
Training alone
won't make men strong.
I'll work them hard
during training
but show them kindness
in the barracks.
What would a two-year man
like you know?
You have to put the screws on
from the start
to teach them what army life
is really like.
So, PFC Kaji,
you're the new assistant?
That is correct.
What will you teach them?
Just what I was taught.
And what were you taught?
Since you were picked
as assistant,
you must know a lot.
But there's one thing
you have yet to learn.
Masui...
teach the lad.
What could a mere private
like me teach PFC Kaji?
Don't try to act big
around me!
How long have you served?
I'll show you how artillery
trains its men!
Cannon No. 1 loaded!
Kaji-san, you're a private 1st class
in the infantry.
You could give Masui
a beating if you wanted.
So our presence would interfere
with training your recruits?
Want to lord it
over them all alone, eh?
Won't let anyone lay a finger
on your precious recruits, eh?
Then get ready
for what you've got coming!
Open your mouth.
Wider!
Now listen carefully!
I didn't plug your ears,
so you should be able to hear.
The pheasant that cries
is apt to be killed.
This one won't cry anymore,
the poor sap.
This is what you get
for slighting the veterans.
When your beloved rookies arrive,
forget the codes and manuals
and teach them that!
Who'll save their hides
under fire?
Not your codes or manuals,
but the vets.
The same ones showing you
such affection now.
Remember that!
The lieutenant!
What's going on here?
Take that slipper
out of your mouth!
Take it out.
I'll overlook
this whole matter...
but only this once.
Such behavior
will not be tolerated!
Nice young kid.
Thank you for everything.
- Get your men settled in?
- Yes, sir.
The vets
may have grumbled,
but you got your way,
even if it meant eating that slipper.
I want to train men
who'll be willing to die with me.
How many men will
the rifle squad get?
Twenty on light machine guns
and 20 on mortars.
Well, are you tired out?
Is the border
close to the enemy?
The enemy?
Yes, very close.
Then this is the very front line.
I can boast to Father.
What does he do?
He's an officer. A major.
Worried about your kid?
I'm not the only one.
I'll be all right, sir.
Sir...
I'm gonna carry
a picture, okay?
Watch the casual language.
What kind of picture?
Of a girl.
Sure. Most pictures
are of girls or boys.
- I told you.
- His is different.
It's a naked woman.
A good luck charm?
Something like that.
It'll never pass inspection.
Better sew it into your loincloth.
Listen here:
Use formal language when
addressing veterans besides myself.
If they hear
"ain't" or "gonna,"
you'll get a beating
you'll never forget.
Understand?
<i>With eager face</i>
<i>and eager voice</i>
<i>My wife and children</i>
<i>urge me on to great deeds</i>
Come here.
A little early to go around
with loose buttons.
Words don't seem
to teach you men anything.
I'll be more careful.
May I have it back, please?
No, you may not.
You can come for it later.
The button must have
worked itself loose.
Go to the veterans' room
and don't waver.
Be prepared for a beating.
Go get it back.
You'll have to handle this yourself.
Recruit Koizumi
to retrieve his button!
<i>Enter!</i>
<i>- What's that? Your button?</i>
<i>- It was my fault.</i>
Tashiro did it!
He pushed me!
What? You dog!
Look at what they serve
the veterans.
Don't tell me you scooped it
up off the ground
with those dainty hands
you wipe your ass with!
Who cut our ration?
Why do you keep blaming me?
Tashiro, stop playing innocent!
What's that?
Cut it out!
Why fight over it now?
What should I do?
What should you do?
Hon. Lance Corporal,
what should he do?
How about another helping
from the kitchen?
No real hurry.
We'll wait.
Very well!
Dump the food
back in the bucket.
Azumi, when that's done,
take it to the vets.
We'll eat just rice.
It's better than nothing.
Take this!
Is that how Kaji taught you?
No, it was all
my own mistake.
You polish your boots
sitting on your ass?
What did you do, Enji?
Ah, the Honorable Assistant.
Kaji, how'd you teach your men
to shine their boots?
- I was at fault.
- Shut your mouth!
How about it, Kaji?
I've yet to give them
any special instructions.
He did teach us.
I was at fault.
You keep quiet.
I'll see that they're taught correctly.
Please forgive him.
Fine.
I'll stand by and watch
how you teach him.
Hit him!
I understand you're opposed
to striking your recruits.
I cannot do it.
Shall I show you how?
Like this!
Sir, strike me!
You're through here. Go!
Son of a bitch!
It's not because
I took a beating.
I want orders forbidding
all corporal punishment of recruits.
I'd go along with you
if we were stationed further back.
But it's different here.
The vets may be louts, but they can
stand on their own two feet.
If I lost control over them,
what would happen in battle?
I'd place my recruits and myself
at your command.
In actual combat...
I couldn't trust you half as much
as I trust those men.
Those jaded five-year vets
wouldn't listen
to a 2nd lieutenant
fresh from the academy.
I understand, sir!
Just a minute.
Michiko wrote me.
I told her
you were here with me.
She can't understand
why you so rarely write,
since you must be enjoying
more freedom here.
More freedom, eh?
Want to read it?
Just give me the gist.
She's relieved. Figures you
have it easy under my command.
She has a lot to learn.
She asked me
to keep an eye on you.
Be careful, Kaji.
Don't twist her words
to support your own position.
Fool!
She's praying that
our worthless lives might be spared,
hoping against hope
that you'll survive.
She repeats that
over and over.
I'm sorry.
You're an officer.
You can write to her.
If you send a reply,
here's what you should say:
"Kaji will not die.
No matter what happens,
he'll make it out alive."
Please tell her that.
2nd Lt. Kageyama.
Okinawa has fallen,
but we have the main island.
The 2.5 million soldiers
waiting there -
- It's too late to pray for miracles.
- We're not!
Our strategy aims
at final victory.
We all like to think so.
Though the home front
expects the tide to turn,
our men are being wiped out.
That's the true picture.
Meaning they died in vain?
Depends on how you look at it.
- Why, you -
- Calm down!
Save your heroism
for your soldiers.
He who shouts loudest
isn't always the bravest.
2nd Lt. Kageyama.
Aren't you making a mistake?
Japan's not as feeble
as you might think.
From the Aleutians
to Australia,
from Tarawa to India,
Japan has pressed the battle
across thousands of miles.
A pessimist like you
can't begin to grasp her strength.
Yes, we've had
to draw back our battle lines.
We've lost Okinawa
and face battle on our mainland.
But that's all part
of our basic strategy.
Look how the enemy doesn't yet
dare attack our main island.
Their supply lines grow longer as our
units grow more ready and compact.
Our main forces
at home are still intact.
Our Pacific losses are like
a single hair off the hide of a bull.
Can't you understand that?
- I understand.
- What do you understand?
That I'll probably die here.
And 2nd Lt. Nonaka...
so will you.
What's going to happen to us?
If the Japanese lose -
Nonsense!
Japan will never lose.
It's un-Japanese
to even consider it!
Un-Japanese? It's only natural
to be concerned about oneself.
Tucking your tails
just 'cause we lost Okinawa!
You have no dedication!
PFC Kaji pampers you!
As far as I'm concerned, he's -
I'm what?
Afraid to say it to my face?
You've said nothing to us
about the fall of Okinawa.
We need a pep talk.
We need faith in our ultimate victory.
You seem to love ultimate victory
even more than food.
Personally, I love my wife
more than ultimate victory.
You may consider that
unmanly.
But when fighting starts,
I'll be the only one
you can count on.
Hey, where's your salute?
Hold it!
You call that a salute?
Hon. Squad Leader!
I alone was at fault.
Let me alone be punished.
Save your breath.
Nice work,
Hon. Squad Leader.
Mind taking over here?
Sir, spare the others!
Just shut up and keep it up!
- Hon. Squad Leader!
- Shut your trap!
Sir!
Naruto, shut up!
I'm taking it too.
You'll keep it up
until he says you can stop...
even if the commander
says otherwise.
Got that?
You dog!
Get up or I'll whack you one!
Who's that?
Enji?
I'm sorry, sir.
When we were rookies,
we kept this up for an hour.
Naruto!
Drinking after hours
and raising hell!
You damned NCOs!
Scum! You dare defy us?
Dog! We'll murder you!
Yeah? Just try it!
You're in for a surprise.
Son of a bitch!
I've been in and out
of worse places.
Throw me in your guard house -
I don't care!
Naruto, they'll throw you
in prison!
Out of my way!
What have you got
to brag about?
You've never earned
an honest meal in your lives!
To hell with all of you!
Sir, please leave this to me.
I'll assume custody of him.
Insubordination
and insulting a superior.
What will happen?
Can you help him?
If the CO feels
that locking up a recruit
would disgrace the company...
Please try to convince him.
Salute the duty officer!
Eyes right!
Front!
Cpl. Takeda
and command of eight men
have duly transferred guard duties
to Cpl. Fujimoto and command.
<i>Out!</i>
Was it tough?
Sorry to concern you.
It was only three days.
They're all waiting.
Naruto's back!
Go on inside.
Naruto, was it rough?
PFC Kaji, come here!
Some training
you're giving your recruits.
Our men are worn out
from guard duty.
What are your men doing?
I'm sorry.
I happened to be out.
That's no excuse!
You'd better teach them right.
And stop acting big
because you're a PFC!
Take that!
Kaji...
get ready!
<i>You scum!</i>
<i>Get up!</i>
Well, how do you like
being sacrificed
for your precious recruits?
That's enough, Akaboshi.
Let's see you
do that again, Akaboshi.
Come on!
I'll cut you wide open!
Don't think I won't do it.
Pride and face
mean nothing to me now.
Come on!
You filthy -
Wait!
Filthy braggarts!
Don't tell me you're afraid
of one two-year man.
I'll swap my life
for one of you stinking worms!
Wait, Kaji!
Afraid to fight man-to-man?
Sir!
Naruto, let me go!
- Sir!
- Let me go!
Don't you rats ever forget:
I'll get even with you someday!
Sir...
next time
let me lend a hand.
Tashiro will help too.
Thanks,
but that would never do.
Why not?
We'd all be called up
for mutiny.
We'll fight it in court.
We'd be sure to lose.
Naruto...
we can't win right now.
Maybe we could give
those vets a good licking...
but they're not the real enemy.
Our real enemy... is the army.
<i>Prepare for roll call!</i>
Sir, don't get up.
I want Lt. Kageyama
to get a good look at my face.
Roll call!
Attention!
First squad: Total 36.
Absent: 4. Present: 32.
Count off!
Unnumbered: 1. Sick room: 4.
All accounted for.
Emergency orders
for this squad.
PFC Kaji and 28 recruits
will depart at 19:00 hrs. Tomorrow
for trench-digging detail.
You'll march at night
to maintain secrecy.
You'll join Cpl. Hironaka's
command on site.
Work detail:
Approximately one month.
This is a cowardly trick...
sending me out with a work party
to avoid friction with the vets.
Look at that way if you wish.
You may think you've rid the company
of its cancerous growth,
but I'll be back in a month...
probably
more malignant than ever.
I don't think so.
When you get back,
I'm sending you away
for special training.
Sending the prodigal son out
for a few knocks in the harsh world?
To South Manchuria.
Maybe even close to Michiko.
Why stay here at the front
if you have a chance to get away?
You agree?
You and I still have
unfinished business.
You avoided the issue,
while I pushed
a little too hard.
Neither of us
accomplished anything.
You're a clever man,
but picking the army
as the stage for your battles
was a fool's work.
It's wiser to play it safe
than to be stubborn.
Will you do
this clever fool a favor?
The mother hen's leaving
half her brood behind.
It causes her some concern.
My absence may make it easier
to keep the vets in line.
Can I count on you?
Don't be such a pessimist.
If you must worry,
worry about your wife.
You must be all out.
Take them.
Sir, please come back to us.
It's only a month.
I get the strange feeling
I'm being stranded.
You and I here together
makes some people nervous.
Neither of us is very patient.
Naruto, watch that temper.
Take any trouble
to Lt. Kageyama, you hear?
<i>Work party, fall in!</i>
Attention!
Salute the honorable lieutenant!
Eyes center!
Front!
PFC Kaji and party
now departing!
Right face!
Forward...
march!
Here comes our water!
Sir!
Take a look.
Good work. Well done.
Feels like I'm building
my own house.
Yes, I suppose you'd want
to fight in here if possible.
I could battle fate
with an easy mind here.
I see.
Sir, that bum wants to bring
his mother and girlfriend to live here.
You idiot!
Your mother might want to sleep
between you and your bride!
Are you engaged?
When the war's over,
let Naruto build you a love nest.
He's a carpenter.
He'll be glad to.
Nakai, you can help
handle his mother.
I'll help handle
the bride anytime!
Sir, you've never told us
about your wife.
She's a good wife.
You'll all have to meet her
after the war.
Is she tall or short?
Medium build.
About 5'2 ", 105 Ibs.
- Just my size!
- Fool!
<i>Work party, fall in!</i>
<i>On the double!</i>
Listen carefully!
At dawn today,
our Seiundai fortifications
were attacked
by heavy Soviet forces.
It seems Major Ushijima
and all his men
died a glorious death.
The enemy
is advancing inland
along the entire
Manchurian border.
We are to return immediately
to barracks to await reassignment.
We are to construct fortifications
along the new line of defense,
where we shall meet
and crush the advancing enemy!
Disperse!
Hit the dirt!
A reconnaissance plane.
Nonaka Platoon,
listen carefully.
Those without rifles will lash
their bayonets to birch staffs
for use in close combat.
Don't we get rifles?
Birch breaks too easily
to be of much use.
Is it my fault
it's all that grows here?
We're moving out!
Break camp!
Prepare to depart in 10 minutes!
Volunteers to go pick up
our weapons!
Tashiro to the supply depot
for weapons!
Very well. Be careful.
We're moving out!
Break camp!
We leave in one hour!
Sir...
what's happening
with our command unit?
These conflicting orders
confuse and demoralize our troops.
Do your griping to the CO!
This is war!
Where's Doi Company?
<i>Over here!</i>
Hironaka Squad?
Over here!
What happened?
We're worn out.
Did you come from Seiundai?
There weren't
any survivors there!
Only Onodera managed
to sneak away.
I didn't sneak away.
I was sent out with a message.
What's the difference?
Why so angry?
At least you got out alive.
Recruits, bring us some food!
What happened at Seiundai?
We got wiped out,
including all
your precious recruits.
Russian shells suddenly started
whistling overhead.
And Lt. Kageyama?
Killed in action.
<i>Aircraft approaching</i>
<i>from the north!</i>
Let's go!
Platoon... halt!
Fall out!
You'll find
no loot around here.
Where's the senior officer?
Good question.
Hey, you know where he is?
Probably giving his girl
a final workover.
In that case, Sergeant,
will you issue orders for weapons?
Sorry, sir, but I'm not
authorized to issue orders.
You'll need orders from HQ.
Where's the phone?
I'll talk to HQ.
Right there.
What's wrong with this thing?
The bombings cut the lines.
Sir, shall I liberate
more candy from the canteen?
Good idea.
Stay where you are!
Traitors!
I'll kill you all!
I'm taking the rifles
on my authority.
300 men can't possibly dig 1.5 miles
of trenches in 48 hours.
You think the enemy will wait
while you finish?
Instead of ineffective
half measures,
we should stop up
the valleys with trenches
and concentrate
on strengthening our fortifications.
When you're the strategy officer,
you can do it your way.
You're stationed in Area C,
I believe?
I'm sorry to say this,
but for strategic reasons,
your area will suffer heavy casualties.
I'm not saying this
to protect myself.
The task is simply impossible.
Even if I order you?
Lieutenant Doi...
proceed with the work.
Yes, sir.
But the Hon. Staff Officer
must remember
that some areas
will not be finished.
Should those breaches prove fatal,
I cannot be held responsible.
To hell with your family.
The fate of Japan is at stake.
If we lose,
we'll have no homes!
Easy for you to say
with no family.
Even if we lose, if I survive,
my wife has a future.
If parents survive,
the kids have a chance to grow up.
It's not them.
You're just afraid to die.
That's enough, Terada.
You're always arguing
with everybody.
Because they only think
of themselves, not our country.
You're not afraid to die?
I am not.
I see.
Well, I am.
I thought you'd say that.
Now that we're in combat,
may I speak my mind?
Go ahead.
You hate me
because my father's a major.
That can't be helped.
But you defend
this cowardly scum
because you're critical
of this war.
It's all right. Let him talk.
Yes, I am critical of it.
I sold my soul
for a military exemption.
I can't approve of how
your father raised you.
So you mean you reject
this war completely?
I mean I should have
rejected it.
Then you're a coward
with a split personality!
You've had your chance
to speak.
Now it's my turn.
You're a fool!
A simpleton who wouldn't understand
why his mother would shed tears
if he was killed in action.
To die here
is a dog's death.
Even you'll understand
that someday, if you survive.
<i>Here come our rifles!</i>
Command squad leader
Cpl. Hironaka.
Light machine gun squad,
PFC Iwabuchi.
Rifle squad, PFC Kaji.
Antitank suicide squad,
PFC Akaboshi.
At ease!
Attention!
Lt. Nonaka will assume
command of Platoon III.
The enemy attack will
presumably commence at dawn.
Each man will dig
a foxhole by midnight
in the spot designated
by his squad leader
and prepare to meet the enemy.
PFC Kaji.
You will take
a scouting party
and ascertain the location
of the enemy.
You'll rejoin this main party
before sundown.
Takasugi and Terada,
step forward.
Ready ammunition!
This is ridiculous!
After five years of training,
they want me crawling under tanks!
I'll bet you recruits
don't want to die either.
Well, don't look to me.
You're on your own.
Your report conflicts
with the others.
Did you penetrate
deeply enough to confirm?
I did, sir.
Can your two men
confirm the 15 tanks?
I left them behind
the embankment, sir.
Why?
We were ordered
to remain behind until called.
And he didn't call you?
- I did not, sir.
- Why not?
Recruits are not trained
in scouting tactics.
Very considerate of you.
You never got close enough
to confirm those tanks.
Coward!
I'm scared out of my wits.
This waiting's getting
on my nerves.
It's already decided
who will live
and who will die.
It's just a few hours till dawn.
We're like condemned men
awaiting execution.
There's white cloth in my foxhole.
It must be a grave.
There are no graves here.
It has to be a grave.
It must be filled
with crumbling bones.
Stop driving yourself crazy!
You're not a child anymore.
Please let me change places
with someone.
Sir...
I'll swap with him.
No!
You'll soon be glad to hide under
corpses. Why worry about a grave?
Terada, go join Cpl. Hironaka
as orderly and runner.
Well, the end has come.
Orders may not be heard
above the din of battle.
Each of you
must think for himself.
There are just two things
I want to say.
Don't be a coward.
Like it or not,
what comes will come.
The other thing is:
Never give up.
Not for the sake of victory,
but for yourself.
If things get too hot,
take cover and think about home...
or your girl.
That's what I plan to do.
Nakai, you got that girl
in your loincloth?
Of course!
Good. Hang on to her.
They're coming!
Send up the signal flare!
Lt. Nonaka,
prepare for action.
Nonaka Platoon,
every man to his station.
Hold your fire.
Commence firing at 300.
Distance 800. Fire!
Blast 'em!
Wipe 'em all out!
Hold your fire!
Save your ammo!
To your right, 400! Fire!
Get those tanks!
Rifle squad...
when the big guns open up,
keep your heads down!
Lhara!
Sir!
What is it?
Tanks closing in on our rear!
Where's the CO?
- Over there!
I'm going!
Wait! They're still firing.
I'll be okay.
Fire!
Keep your heads down!
Sir!
Koizumi...
Mimura...
Our only alternative
is to attack.
Send a runner to the CO.
Ask what he plans to do.
Terada, take the message!
Terada relaying the message!
I'm out of ammo, sir!
Azumi, you got ammo?
Let me have some.
No, I'm short too.
You're not even firing!
Fine, keep it!
I'm out of ammo, sir!
I warned you about wasting it.
Here.
Wait! Stay here.
We'll fire together.
Commander!
Where's that runner?
Enemy troops to our rear!
We're trapped!
We all feel safer
with you here, sir.
And I want to send you home
safe to your mothers.
Enji!
I'm out of ammo, sir!
I'll take him some.
You'll go?
I'm out. Ammo!
I'll be right back.
No, if you go, stay there.
Make every bullet count, okay?
Get ready. I'll cover you.
Go!
Tashiro!
Nakai, stay down!
Tashiro!
Sons of bitches!
Lieutenant, should we retreat?
Fool!
Long live the Japanese empire!
You fool, come back!
Terada, what are you doing?
Where's the tank?
It's gone.
Does it hurt?
They'll come back for us again.
The major's son fought bravely.
You just might
make it through this.
I'll sear your wound.
Close your eyes.
Rifle squad!
Rifle squad, show yourselves!
Anyone there?
I refuse to die.
- What'll we do?
- One final charge.
A final charge?
Watch out, Kaji!
Onodera.
Will we make it?
They coming this way?
- You got a grenade?
- No.
If we have to,
we jump at 'em.
Please save me!
Are they gone?
Are they?
- Quiet!
They're still up there.
Stop shooting!
He'll get us all killed!
- Stop shooting!
- I got him in the leg!
The battle's over.
No, it's not!
I'm gonna attack!
If you wanna die like a dog,
go ahead.
What do we do now?
We were lucky
to come through it alive.
Let's try and stay that way.
All right, we get it!
We know how tough you are.
Stop showing off!
You don't know
the Kwangtung Army!
He's raving mad!
Pin him down, Kaji!
Come on,
you damned Ruskies!
I'll chop you up!
Onodera, it's too dangerous!
Quiet!
You don't know
how tough I am!
Quiet or we'll all be killed!
Onodera, be quiet!
Be quiet!
What happened?
He's dead.
I won't claim
I put him out of his misery.
I killed him!
You didn't have to kill him.
Do you blame me?
Do you?
I'm a monster!
But I'm going to stay alive!
Is anyone there?
Isn't anyone left alive?
Answer me!
Is anyone else still alive?
END OF PART 4
