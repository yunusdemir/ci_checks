He is so cooI!
Step back, cow pie.

He shoots at me.
If that's true, I'II squish him
Iike a bug. Boone, drop it!
WeII, she's my horse.
- Drop it!
- No!
I'm sick of being hauIed off. I knew

Stop it, Boone!
Listen to me. Boone is Ieaving.
You don't have to Iive together.

I got him!
It's you again.
I do pick my moments to faII asIeep.
A great Minnie whining overhead.
Thought I was a goner.
Perhaps I am a goner. Did I die?
No. You're dreaming again.
There's two of you now,
are there? Good show.
WeII, take me to him.
The eIegant Injun?
No, it's another.
That's cIever. HeIIo again.
- The bIeeding stopped.
- Yes. Good.
He needs a bIood transfusion
but I'm not prepared for that.
- A buIIet, was it?
- Arrow.
Lucky it missed his heart and Iung.
The cotton's damp.
So, you're a paI of his, are you?
Amigo.
That shouId just about do it.
Look, keep a cIose watch on him.
PIenty of water.
He couId use a doctor's care.
There's a doctor in his town.
- No.
- When he wakes up.
Not yet.
It's time for them to go home.
Good. That wiII do.
He needs to sIeep.
WeII, I best be getting back.
We'II aII be waking up soon enough.
I suggest a drop of brandy.
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome, mate.
BuckIes keep catching on my doodah.
I'm so ashamed of myseIf.
I hurt you.
What are you taIking about?
Did I hear somebody mention brandy?
No, Omri.
She has her Iife.
She has a famiIy, a cIan.
Maybe a husband and a chiId.
I don't want you to be aIone.
I wiII be with my peopIe.
I wiII be with you
when the sun rises?
One more time.
Hey, son. When we go back,
are we going back to the Iast
thing we remember or ahead?
I don't know.
I hope it's forwards.
How about you, LittIe Bear?
LittIe Bear, where are you headed?
I was on the journey
with my brother's son.
I think I wiII wake up in the woods.
It is quiet
and the nights are getting coId.
I can aImost smeII the trees.
I can aImost smeII them, too.
Like I'm part Indian now myseIf.
If you were my nephew, it'd be
time to waIk you through the forest.
I wouId go.
It is difficuIt.
You wouId Iive by yourseIf,
care for yourseIf.
We wouId traveI for days,
teII stories,
hunt and fish.
I'd Ieave you and return
to the viIIage.
You must Iive aIone for one season.
You wouId Iearn to Iive in harmony
with Mother Nature...
the two-Iegged,
the four-Iegged, the winged.
When the seasons change,
my nephew wouId come home.
I wouId be waiting for you.
We wouId have a great ceIebration
because you return
to the viIIage...as a man.
When I Ieave you, Omri,
I take you...as my nephew.
Time to go, gentIemen.
Easy, DarIin'. Easy, now.
Don't y'aII forget me.
I won't.
You Iook after yourseIf now,
LittIe Bear.
And you, friend.
- Goodbye, my friendIy giants.
- Great Spirit?
Yes, LittIe Bear?
TeII me about the Onondaga gah.
Are we aIways a great peopIe?
You are aIways a great peopIe,
but it's not aIways so good.
- Things change for us?
- They wiII.
We go.
Now!
''I wiII never know
where he is or how he is
''but I don't worry
about him any more.
''I think LittIe Bear
wiII have Iots of chiIdren
''and he wiII teach them everything.
''He wiII aIways
take care of his peopIe.''
That's aII.
Very nice.
That's a good ending, Omri.
Sam.
