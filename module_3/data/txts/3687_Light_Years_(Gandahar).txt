"LIGHT YEARS AWAY"
- You like it here?
- I wouldn't spend the rest of my life here.
But I'm free. I could get out tomorrow if I want.
Free like a bird.
Like a bird.
Who is it?
Yeah, alright! I'm coming!
Alright! Alright!
Hell is paved with the lazy of this world.
You'll get to know, young man, that
people don't slam doors on me like that.
But it's a good sign.
Mad, mad.
Like a bird.
Bad luck.
Were you sick yesterday?
Why didn't you call or say something?
We were up to our bloody necks here all day.
Perhaps you weren't sick at allÉ
just didn't feel like coming in.
He doesn't want to work so he doesn't
come to work. Simple as that!
- What have you go to say?
- Yeah, yeah, I was sick.
And I just didn't want to wash glasses.
You were sick or you just
didn't want?
Both. That's what I'm trying to tell you. The idea of washing glasses
made me sick; I just didn't want to.
- It made me want to fucking puke!
- I don't want to see you anymore around here!
- Slobs like you aren't worth a penny!
- Yeah? Take on a couple.
Very funny. Get out of here, you sack.
Good, I won't get to see this
filthy place anymore.
Oh, don't forget about my pay though.
Alright, but I haven't got the time now.
You'll have to come back later.
Fine, I'll come back, with a few mates.
So make sure it's all there, alright?
- Until then, kiss the old woman for me.
- Piss on!
"Yoshka Poliakoff. "
"Palace Garage. "
He left town.
"And, he knew right away,
he had brought for the power. "
"Joshka Poliakoff.
Palace Garage. "
Well, there's no garage around here.
I take this road every day.
You must be mistaken.
- There's no garage around here, take it from me.
- Not around here anyway.
There was a garage on the old road,
but that was a long time ago.
Must be 15 years now since they built
the road through the hills.
Nobody goes by there anymore.
You know, I've often wondered
what the old man finds to do there.
Nobody's ever guessed his secret.
He's looking for a garage, not for the loony bin.
- Somebody lives there?
- Yeah, the proprietor.
- A Russian, he's never moved out.
- He's not a Russian; he's lived there all his life.
- His father was.
- What does he look like? What's his name.
Poliakoff, we call him crazy Paul around here.
- Is it far from here?
- It's quite a distance, about two hours on foot.
There's a van that goes by every now and then,
you might be in luck.
Anybody in?
Hello, old son. So we meet again.
- What are you doing here?
- I was waiting for you to come back.
- Waiting for me? Why's that?
- Well, I thought with the address in that bookÉ
Because of address in the book, you
thought I had invited you?
- Well, it's cold outside and I was tired.
- Tired from what?
From walking, I have been walking for hours.
- Is walking work?
- No.
Then you have no reason to be tired,
and no right to be at my place.
- But it's cold outside!
- Outside is where you belong.
You have no right to be in here like a stray dog.
Do you sleep when you're waiting for somebody?
Come on, pack your bags and get out of here.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Would it be possible for me to buy
something to eat from here?
Yes, perhaps. I haven't got very much.
What would you like?
Don't know. Bread, cheese, some eggs,
and, um, some ham if you got any.
- You're traveling around here, are you?
- No, no. I don't live very far away.
Also, you seeÉ
- Well, I'd like to get a present for someone.
- Oh.
Well, it's not exactly a gift shop, is it?
- Perhaps a chicken?
- I haven't got any chickens.
Got some pigs.
- Yeah, okay. Let's have a piglet.
- A pig?
- For your girlfriend, is it?
- No, no.
It's for an old man, at the garage.
- Yoshka?
- Yeah, that's what they call him.
- But do you know him?
- No, I live at his place.
You don't say.
A pig? That's exactly what he needs, a pig.
- One of these will make a nice present, no?
- Yeah, that's good.
Well, lad, you seem to have a one-track mind.
I just want to say sorry for
upsetting you this morning.
Nobody ever upsets me.
What the hell is that?
- A converted soul?
- It's for you.
- What do you think I'm going to do with it?
- Whatever you want.
Oh, so it can make the tea
and look after the petrol pump?
Let's have a look at it.
What do you want with me?
No idea. Perhaps I could give you a hand.
Give me a hand? There's a whole heap
of people you can go and help.
- Why come to me?
- Don't know. I just thought that maybeÉ
You don't know?
You do things without knowing why?
Tell me what you can do.
Nothing special, but I can learn.
And you're counting on me for that?
Come have a glass of tea.
- What are your interested in?
- Everything.
Everything and nothing. You're all the same.
- Know anything about birds?
- No.
No, of course you don't, you don't know anything.
Why should I give you something I
spend my life learning?
You, who don't know a damn thing.
I don't have the money to feed you.
And even if I had, what would be the
use of feeding a dead loss like you?
Just tell me what to do, and I'll work at it.
I've got a bit of money.
- How much?
- About 50 pounds.
And you think with that you could stick
around long enough to lose your stupidity?
Let's have a look at the money.
Got to free yourself of this stuff,
that's the first step.
Have you eaten?
- Yeah.
- Who chewed your bread for you?
I chewed it myself.
Fine, fine.
And as for the job, you can
go and chew that, too.
Good night.
Good night.
What's he doing in there, eh?
What's he doing?
Let's clear out this shit!
How are you today, Charlie?
What are we doing here?
You haven't had anything to eat, have you?
I got nothing to give you.
You seem clueless, eh.
Hey, let's get out of here.
That bloke in the pub was right.
That old man is raving mad.
You must be absolute off your head
to be what you're doing up there.
You really don't know what he's
doing in his shed?
I've never known.
I've slept with him in the
next room often enough.
but I never got through that door.
And I really wanted to know his secret.
It was driving me mad.
Caught me going through his pockets one day.
Looking for the key.
He was furious. He went crazy.
Well, that was the end.
That was ten years ago now.
- And you live alone since then?
- I live here, with my dad.
He's an old man now.
Must sayÉ
it does me good to see someone
like you around here.
Well, come on then.
Let's go inside.
Come on.
-Hello, old son.
-Hello.
What are you going to do this morning?
I was thinking of cleaning the petrol pumps.
It's filthy.
Not a bad idea.
Why don't you put varnish on my toenails
after you wash my feet?
You're full of goodwill old son, but
you haven't understood a thing yet.
I see you got a new pig.
- Much better. - Yeah, it's going alright.
He seems to like it around here.
He's a bit hungry, like me.
Well, he's understood something that you've
yet understood. And he's younger than you.
- What have you been feeding him on?
- Barley meal, I haven't got any more.
From now I'm going to do something for you
that you've been doing for him.
Perhaps that will help you to understand
the relative wisdom of the pig
and the depths of your ignorance.
I'll feed you as long as you work.
As for the pig, he's not going to work.
One of these days, we're going to eat him.
That's the advantage you have over him.
But, you see, you've got to accomplish something.
It's no good scratching around in
the dust with a hoe.
You've got to dig down, into the depths.
Dig down near the violence and love.
You've got to lose yourself in the earth.
You've got to become a fertilizer.
You've got to become the rain and the sun.
If you just do what I tell you,
you can have your meals with me.
How long will all this take?
It may take days, or even years.
That's up to you.
You're right, it really is a filthy pump.
It hasn't served petrol in a long time.
Not because of the new road.
But because they know I'm not there to serve them.
So if they were to see someone standing by
the pump, they might come back again.
Oh, I could do exactly that.
I've already worked at a petrol station.
You have? Fine.
But they've got to be able to
see you all the time.
If I think you're doing a good job,
I'll bring food for you.
Otherwise, you'll have to eat grass.
And you've got to chew that really well.
Otherwise, you get a pain the gut.
How can I serve any petrol if no one
drives past the fucking pump?
It's your fault!
Good night!
What the hell is he doing?
He's going to let me die
standing next to this bloody pump.
Shit!
I haven't sold a single gallon
of this petrol in four days!
It's taking the shit out of me.
What the hell am I doing here?
Tomorrow, mate. You can do it by yourself.
Because I have off.
And if you don't like it, well,
that's too bad.
Hi!
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday
but I didn't want to disturb you.
You had a big reception at
your place last night.
- I've got the right, haven't I?
- Of course you have.
But don't let strangers come to near
the shed. Understand?
She wasn't a stranger.
- Who was it then?
- It was me.
Betty!
So you're running after little boys now?
Better than old men though, isn't it?
I could show youÉ
But I only got breakfast for one.
I'll get something for you.
No, I'll get it.
- Did you bring Betty here?
- No.
She came all by herself.
I'm not surprised.
I don't want her poking her
nose into my business.
She hasn't done anything wrong.
She's very fond of you, she told me so.
And I'm very fond of her,
but that's not the point.
I know what she wants.
If you're going to have a love affair,
you'll have to go somewhere else.
- I'm not going to have her sneaking around my place.
- I'll do just what I want.
Oh, will you?
Well, if she comes back here agin,
I shall kick both of you out.
When will you go to see that the winds are
in favor of your father?
Why don't you tell me?
What wonderful weather!
What a magnificent day!
I knew it, my son.
A fantastic storm!
The skies are going to spit and speak,
and turn your body and your head inside out.
Yes! I've just been round to the weather station
at the airfield and they've confirmed it all.
It's going to be a great storm!
We're going to enjoy this together.
We'll watch it from these front row seats.
Start getting the food out.
Oh god.
Gone again.
What is he doing in that shed?
What's happened to you? Are you alright?
Don't ask any questions, son.
Let's go into the garden.
Fetch the spade and shovel.
Now, dig a hole
3 feet wide, 5 feet long, and 3 feet deep.
Done. It's finished.
Good.
I'm going to stay here three days
and three nights.
And when I come out of this whole,
my wounds will be healed.
You know where the food is.
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine like this.
- What do you want to eat?
- Nothing.
Bring me a glass of water in the evening
and in the morning.
And don't bother about me.
- I could get you some milk.
- I said water.
You'll be alright?
Like a cloud.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Still on the pump?
- Yeah, as you can see.
- The old man's taken you on?
- Yeah, he's taken me on.
- Does he pay well?
- Uh, well, the usual.
Normally I get my petrol in town
but this morning, when I saw you, I said
to myself, "I'll get it here. "
And then I can have a bit of a talk with you.
Fill her up.
- It doesn't seem to work.
- Of course it doesn't.
The tank must be empty and the pump is fucked.
The old man pays you to stand just like that,
all day long in front of an empty pump.
They're not so wrong, all those around here,
who say the old man is going around the bend.
No wonder they're scared of him around here.
Bye bye.
Jonas!
Dig me out of here! It's done.
Jonas!
Your burnsÉthey seem to have healed.
My nights were better than yours
You think it looks nice out there?
- What?
- All that scrap.
- No. Yes. It's alright.
- You don't think we should do something about it?
It's terrible.
Well?
- Nothing we can do about it.
- I don't agree.
What bothers me most is that it's all mixed up.
When everything gets mixed up,
everything gets destroyed.
Things, like people, go in families.
Now if you really wanted to do me a good turn,
you'd start sorting out all that mess
and bring it together in families.
I'd be really happy if you do that.
Anyway, what else could you do?
Well, I don't know, but if you want, I can try.
It will take some time,
and it will be hard work
but I'll bring you something to eat
three times a day.
Where have you gone, pig?
Friend, you're the only one
who talks to me around here.
Pig, pig!
Pig!
He's eating you.
That old bastard! He's eating my fucking pig!
I become his dog and he's eating my pig!
I'm going to do and he's
going to let me die of hunger.
And he's eating my only friend!
Well, son, I see you're getting to
the end of your work.
It could have been done better,
all the same, you deserve a reward.
Where is he? The pig, he's disappeared.
I was gonna tell you about the pig.
Come on into my place.
I'm inviting you in.
We'll have a good meal.
Come on.
He has fulfilled his destiny.
Animals aren't all little pets
with pink ribbons around their necks.
Here he is. Juicy and well cooked.
And better than he ever was before.
Come, sit down.
For a long time, I've been
having the same dream.
I come out of the garage in the morning
and I see all those cars in the scrapyard
shining in the sun.
As if the old metal was new
and the paintwork freshly sprayed.
You're gonna tell me it's mad,
but then all dreams are pretty mad.
When a dream comes back time after time,
it's got to mean something.
When I see all that metal, all dirty,
it makes me feel very sad.
And every time I see it like that
my dream comes back.
What do you think that means?
Well, I don't know? It don't mean anything.
Right. It doesn't mean anything.
There's no reason why those old hogs
should suddenly start shining.
All the same,
when I watched you sorting out all those
bits of metal, with all that energy
I said to myself,
perhaps he could help me make my dream come true.
But no, I couldn't ask him to do a thing
like that. It's impossible.
No, it's possible.
- You really think so?
- Certainly. I'll do it.
Splendid.
Very nice.
What the hell is that?
A lump of scrap, in the middle
of all this light?
You should have got rid of it.
Buried it, or painted it with gold.
You really don't understand, do you?
Either you do things properly,
or you don't do them at all.
Son of a bitch!
Pick up some dirt,
and put back everything the way it was before
since you're so incapable of
understanding anything.
And I'll give you three days
to see that the sun never shines again
on that pile of scrap.
- Three days and three nights.
- Bastard.
Shit!
Shit!
Bastard!
Christ!
Jonas!
Jonas!
Jonas! Get out of there.
Get out. Get out of there!
Feeling better?
I've left a jug of water
over there and something to eat.
You can stay here until you're better.
I'll go to sleep in the other room.
When you get better,
you can look at some of these.
What's that?
They're everything you got
to know about eagles.
I'd like you to read that very carefully.
I'm gonna leave you now.
Good night.
Good night.
Well, now you've done a lot of cleaning
up and looked after the pump.
I could always take you on as a cook.
But I've got something better for you to do,
and you can start right away.
- Have you read all that stuff thoroughly?
- Yes, read and reread it. It's all I've done for a week.
And there's nothing I don't know about eagles,
not now.
Isn't there a bird missing
from your collection?
I don't have a collection.
This isn't a zoo here, you know.
This is where I learn, observe, and study.
The birds are my teachers.
But I must have an eagle.
That's absolutely essential
That's the one teacher that's missing.
Do you think you could help?
An eagle.
It doesn't look as simple as that.
- I'll try.
- I'll let you have money for the road.
- You know where to find one, you know they have it.
- Yeah. It'd just be as simple to get one from a zoo.
No, son. I want a wild bird.
Not a moth-eaten specimen that lives in captivity.
When you come back, you'll be going into the shed.
You'll get to know my secret.
We're going to work together.
I don't know you.
What's your name?
Son of the clouds.
Is that so?
You're not from around these parts.
- Where are you from?
- From the clouds.
You come in here and pick up our women.
Looking for pickups.
This isn't a whorehouse.
I'm going to smash your face in.
Come on, leave him alone.
You got no balls?
So,
you don't only like little girls,
but birds as well.
Buy me another drink,
and I'll tell you all about the birds.
You had too much to drink.
Okay.
I'll shut up.
I'll shut my mouth.
Alright, but it's the last one.
One from last.
Now,
I tell you were you're gonna
find Thomas the hunter.
Go easy on this mountain.
Watch the cliffs; they're dangerous.
Night's coming on. You could be killed.
Hello.
Are you Thomas?
How do you know me?
Well, they talked about you in a village.
It's you I've been looking for.
So,
I've been on the right track, at least, but it
was a bit of luck actually finding you up here.
Luck is right.
You could be here for weeks.
What the hell are you doing on this
side of the mountain anyway?
- Were you looking for me?
- That's right.
- Do you know much about eagles?
- Only through books.
Books. Typical.
Do you know? Long ago,
nobody had to study at all.
They just knew everything.
They could recognize an eagle by just his flight.
By the way he circle around his female.
They just knew.
Nowadays, they have to study everything.
They write books about everything.
But for me, the birds and the
animals are life. Not books.
I suppose somebody will come here
one day to study me.
Imagine! To write a book about me.
A while back,
I didn't really tell you the truth.
I don't study birds.
I've got to bring an eagle back for a friend.
- You mean to catch one?
- That's right.
Well in a way, I prefer that.
- Of course, you know it's completely forbidden?
- No, I didn't know.
- Does that make it difficult for you?
- Not really, no.
Just catching the eagle is the problem.
- Do you want a full-grown one?
- Yes, if it's possible.
It will take us several days.
- Hey, you don't work for a zoo, do you?
- No.
I don't, I swear. Cross my heart.
That's alright.
This will be a good place.
Put the traps just over there.
A lot of game comes this way.
The eagle are sure to come by.
One eagle.
What's the matter?
You locked yourself out?
Yoshka.
Yoshka.
Jonas!
Jonas, I knew you were coming back today.
I've been waiting since daybreak.
Have you been here long?
About an hour.
- I didn't see you.
- I've been watching you. I was sitting over there.
You looked like the trunk of an old tree.
You didn't see me?
No, son, I didn't see you.
- How do you do that?
- I can't explain.
Even less can I teach you how to do it.
But when the day comes, you'll be
able to enter things from the center
and not work in from the outside.
When I see you like that,
I feel like a toad crossing mud.
Well, I'm a toad, too,
and I've even the mud of the world.
I know you've caught an eagle.
It's in your suck.
It's in chloroform, but I
can feel it moving already.
Well, we're gonna put him where
he belongs... in the shed.
I bought you a bed..
It's in the kitchen..
Come over here.
What you see here represents a whole
lifetime of work.
And now it's almost ready.
One of these days, I'm going to fly.
- I knew that was it.
- Of course you did.
Only I'm not coming back.
I'll be leaving you everything, but before that,
you've got to get to know everything.
I want you to help me
carry out my observations and make
the necessary modifications to put the thing together.
See? You can't play around with weight.
You're going to read all those books, and every
morning at breakfast we're gonna talk about you.
- About me?
- Yes, about you.
All you feel, all your sensations,
all you do, all you know.
You'll have to feed the birds.
Try the eagle.
And make quite sure he doesn't escape.
How did you know the dawn was coming up
and it wasn't two in the morning?
I don't know.
- Maybe you thought, "what time is it?"
- No, I knew that straight away.
How did you know that?
PerhapsÉ
because of the quality of the silence,
the depth of the shadow.
When did the birds start to sing?
When I was putting my socks on.
Well, go on, from where you
left off a minute ago.
I got up. No, noÉ
First of all, I sat down.
I put my bare feet on the cold ground.
I went to have a pee.
And then I put my socks on.
They were dirty, and I kept
thinking that I should wash them.
I stretched myself.
With my arms up toward the ceiling, and I was
listening to the singing of the first birds
and, suddenly, one of my
back bones made a crack.
I drink some milk from the bottle.
I had the feeling it was very thick.
It slipped down my gullet.
I felt it go into the stomach.
I washed my face under the tap.
And got the impression tat
that the water was made of light.
- And then you went out?
- Right.
It was cold outside.
It must have been raining in the night,
because I stepped in a puddle.
I heard the water dripping into
the barrel in the corner of the garage.
I went past the pump.
And I saw the face of the man in the van
who asked me for petrol.
I walked along the road.
The day had just began to break
on the horizon.
And I asked myself why I had come here.
I lived through again the day
you knocked on my door,
my arrival here,
the pig,
the fire,
the meal in the truck the night it stormed.
And, then,
suddenly, I understood why
you'd knock on my door
and why I'd come here.
Why?
Can't tell you.
- You know the reason why?
- Yeah.
Why did you kick Betty out?
I didn't kick her out, she just left.
It's an old story.
It happened about ten years ago.
She said you kicked her out.
She was getting too inquisitive.
She wanted to get into the shed.
- You didn't really love her?
- Of course I loved her.
But men can't share everything.
Anyway, women don't want men to fly.
If she'd known,
everything would have been ruined.
I saw the sunrise
and I could smell the smell of the earth.
The colors were changing.
And something else I saw was
the heat of the sun's first rays
had made the grass move.
It didn't really move,
but it did seem to react.
And your own body,
did it seem to change
under the sun's rays?
Yes, yes it did. Like the grass.
And the mountains behind you?
Well, I couldn't see them from where I was.
If you could feel
the action of the rays on the grass
and on your own body
you should have been able to
feel the reaction everywhere.
Men, insects, the air,
the whole face of the Earth that
was illuminated.
Did you feel that a part of
the Earth was in shadow?
I felt that the earth
deep beneath my feet was in shadow.
Did you see any further?
No, no I don't think so.
You should have goon right down to the center
of the Earth, to see the shadow there
where your own eye couldn't see it.
YoshkaÉ
Just as the sun was coming up,
for a moment,
I saw it all black.
Everything was dark, except for
the field which stayed bright.
- Did you stay there a long time?
- A few minutes.
- Did anything go through your mind?
- No.
- How can you be sure of that?
- I know it.
- Were you feeling your body?
- No, I felt nothing.
Do you remember that day you
came back with the eagle?
You were sitting by the shed.
Well I was in the same state then for several hours
that you had been through this morning.
And after, what happened after?
I thought that everything was beautiful,
and, then, everything changed.
Everything went back to what it was before.
You know why it changed?
Because my mind started working.
If you mind had stayed still,
the brilliance would have stayed on the field.
- Yesterday's trials were pretty good,
don't you think? - Yeah, yeah, fine.
I've just been to the airfield to get measurements
of wind speed and air currents.
I should go back later this afternoon.
The wind should hold
and later on, it should get
stronger by night time.
Are you going to have another trial?
There's no possible room for error now.
I'm not going to smash myself up like I did last time,
launching off from the hill, do you remember that?
If the winds keep up, tonight's the night.
The great takeoff.
I guessed as much.
Every thing has its moment in time.
The moment has come.
I should like us to have been
together a little longer.
The last few weeks have been
the best time of my life.
Maybe we'll see each other again.
You know damn well we won't.
I'm going beyond the galaxies.
I should soon be hundreds of
light years from here.
When I've gone, I want you to go into town and
see my old friend, Branislav.
He's an awful lawyer, but somehow I trust him.
He'll take care of everything.
It's all yours.
From time to time, he'll be
sending you a little money.
And you know where the petty cash is.
Of course, you could sell everything,
if you wanted to.
But somehow I can't see anybody
who want to buy all this junk.
No, I don't want to sell anything.
The eagle got away.
Come closer.
Try to understand.
I've bathed in the soul of these birds.
That will keep me airborne in space.
How's the wind?
- It gets stronger, it gets stronger.
- Good, then this is the time.
Time to go, Jonas.
Goodbye, old son. Blow back the big door!
Yoshka!
- Is it you who lives with the old Russian fellow?
- Yeah, it's me.
Well, you better come along with us.
There's been an accident.
Nobody understands what's happened.
Perhaps you can help us settle things.
- Where?
- Over there, about 20 miles from here.
- 20 miles?
- Yeah.
Look at his eyes. He hasn't got
any eyes, just holes.
The eagle did that.
The eagle?
- What eagle?
- The eagle pecked his eyes out.
The eagle stopped him in his flight,
made him fall.
Look, there it is!
My boss has just died.
That's why I've come to town.
If my boss had kicked the bucket,
it would make me really happy.
- You've come for his funeral?
- No, he didn't want to be put into a coffin.
- So what did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
I justÉ
Put him in a very deep hole with nothing on.
Nothing between his body and the earth.
No coffin, no tombstone, just nothing.
Oh Christ. Is that what he wanted?
To be buried like a dog?
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Well then, what have you come here for?
To get drunk, eh?
No, to pick up his will. I go
over to the lawyer's tomorrow.
You see, well, he left me everything.
You're a lucky boy.
Well, you can buy me another drink then.
Oye!
Make them doubles.
Well, this is really a very strange will.
Knowing Yoshka, one could hardly
expect anything ordinary.
I'll read it to you.
- In the meanwhile, why don't you have a
drink with me? - With pleasure.
- Is it your intention to sell the garage?
- No.
If you feel like selling it,
come and see me.
I'll take care of it.
And for the money, I will send it
to you by post. Every month.
- What are you going to do over there?
- I don't know.
MaybeÉl might try to get the pump working.
- How old are you?
- 25.
- So you were born in '75?
- Yes, that's right, '75.
- Which day?
- The 23rd of October.
- Come on.
- No.
Read it to me.
I've never seen a will, really.
- Are there secrets in it?
- No, there's not.
- You would not understand it.
- I'm not stupid.
I know you're not stupid!
It's just very strange.
Oh come, please, just a little. Like that.
- Come on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll read you the last bit, alright?
Here we are. It's the best bit.
"He will go back to the garage
and every day, in the big shed,
he will read a phrase,
and think about it,
and then swallow it whole. "
- Alright? Do you want to listen to the phrases?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
"Enter into a tree. "
- A tree?
- Yeah.
- Why a tree?
- I don't know.
- That's funny. And?
- "Spread your body over the world. "
"Penetrate the sound of
your own name. "
"Feel the sensations between your eyes. "
"Through your mind, life your body into space. "
"Swallow light"
"You are the wind. "
"Twirl into space without limits. "
"Between each tremor,
see the still light. "
"In the forest, one tree is yours. Find it. "
Very funny.
"Truly, truly
everyody
is the Universe. "
He's a strange one.
But he's got magic.
What's the matter? You don't like me?
Yeah, I like you.
- As a matter of fact, I like you a lot.
- Well, that's alright, come on, come along with me.
And what? Bury myself in the desert?
No, I wouldn't last three days.
You do realize what you're doing though?
Oh, you like being a slave?
No. I'm not going to finish my life here,
you know.
And I bet I get more freedom here
than I would have in your place.
- Over there, I'd be your slave 24 hours a day.
- 24 hours of loving.
Oh, not for me.
- Yeah, come on, out!
- Fuck off, will you!
Leave me be!
Yeah, yeah, nice, sorry.
I'll leave you be.
Oye.
I like you all the same, really.
And if you come by some time,
drop in and say hello.
We'll go on from where we left off, okay?
I'll be seeing you.
I see you!
