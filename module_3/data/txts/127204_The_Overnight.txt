- This is the best.
- All right.
- I fucking love this.
- Okay.
- This feels so fucking good.
- All right.
I fucking love fucking you.
Okay.
It's okay.
Sorry, was I saying "fucking" too much?
No, it's fine.
It's good. I like it.
- Just keep it down, okay?
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Tell me I have a big dick.
You've got a big dick, sweetie.
Yeah. Say, giant.
You've got a giant dick,
sweetie, and I love it.
- Yeah.
- I love it.
- Yeah.
- Circles, please.
- Okay.
- Circles.
- There we go. Yeah.
- Okay. All right.
Bigger circles, baby.
Bigger circles.
I feel like I'm giving
big circles right now.
Okay. Okay.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay. I'm good.
Are you good? You good?
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah. Let's do this.
- Great.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
He's awake.
- Okay, hurry up.
- Okay.
There's still time.
- My God.
- I can come.
There's still time for me.
- Honey, he's awake.
- No, no, no.
- He's awake!
- I'm coming!
Mama!
- Hey, buddy!
- It smells weird.
- It does smell weird?
- Yeah.
- Okay. Let's go, let's go.
- All right.
Do you know where RJ's summer pants are?
I have to put an
outfit on RJ. Where...
My summer pants?
Yeah, I'm looking for
your summer pants, buddy.
Emily.
We really should have labeled the boxes.
I didn't realize
that we had this much stuff.
All right. Well, I guess
he's just gonna fry to death out there
'cause all we have is like
wintry, fleecy stuff.
I mean, I feel like
we could get rid of half this shit.
Yeah, well,
you know. Come on.
It's LA, dude.
It's every day, sunshine.
Are you wearing that
to a child's birthday party?
- Come on.
- It's a little crazy at work.
I really want to get a jump on things.
Really?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Is that cool?
Honey.
I thought this was
gonna be like our chance to meet people.
Just this one time.
I mean, you go to work
and you talk to people.
- Honey.
- I don't talk to people.
- And it's weird.
- Alex...
I know.
- Like, I'm a grown-up person...
- I know.
- Like, going and...
- I know.
Am I supposed to just ask other
grown-ups if they
want to be friends?
You could.
- You could start there.
- Sweetie, stop.
- You could.
- That's crazy.
It's not crazy.
Seriously, am I...
Am I seven years old?
You're not seven years old.
How do you not worry about this stuff?
'Cause I don't need anybody else.
I got everything I need under this roof.
Well, that's a nice thing to say.
Yeah, it's true.
All right. Well...
Good luck with the summer pants.
Stop saying summer pants.
It's your...
It's your word.
No, it's not.
You started saying it first.
No. I think
they're called shorts.
Why did I cut those
off into shorts? What am I doing?
My son looks like an idiot.
All right, fuck you, too.
Hey, bud.
You having fun?
- Not really.
- You want to go home?
But I just got here.
- What?
- Hi!
- Hey.
- Hey, handsome boys.
- Hi.
- You came.
Look what I got.
What's in here?
- My God.
- Gummy Worms.
- Gummy Worms!
- Jeez.
- See?
- Of course.
Look at that?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Thank you for coming.
I know, I was just at work.
I was feeling very guilty,
I wasn't getting any work done, so,
- I came to play.
- That's really nice.
Really nice.
Thanks.
My gosh.
That's what I'm talking about.
Gummy Worms and kids?
It's like chumming the ocean for sharks.
- You're a genius.
- Yeah.
Hey, buddy.
Hold on.
What's... What's going on?
- Who's...
- I don't know.
What is this guy... Why...
I don't know.
- Why is he talking to RJ?
- I don't know.
- Should you go talk to him?
- Should I?
- Maybe?
- I don't know.
I mean, if he's gonna...
Here he comes.
He's coming. He's coming.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
Is that boy yours over there?
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm glad I caught this.
This, my friend, is a pest
that wreaks havoc on little boys' bellies.
I don't know where he got it from,
but I wanted to bring it to your attention.
Well, thank you.
That would've been terrible if he ate it.
Yeah.
My son Max is on a strict vegan diet.
And a cleanse.
Just kidding. I'm Kurt.
Hey, I'm Alex.
This is Emily, my wife.
- Emily, Alex, pleasure. How are you?
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
So you guys part of the birthday party or...
No, no. This is our usual
park. We come here every day.
- Cool.
- How about you?
I haven't seen you in the
neighborhood, you're new around here?
Yeah, we just moved here from Seattle.
- Two weeks in.
- Two weeks.
- Yeah.
- Wow. Well, welcome.
You guys picked
the coolest area in Los Angeles.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Absolutely.
You know, we heard that this is where
the younger people with kids were living.
This park's fucking fantastic.
You've got two oyster bars.
One of which is the shit.
- That's great.
- Shops...
My wife and I moved here
about two years ago, we love it.
- Wow!
- Cool. Awesome.
That's great.
Wow.
Max has really taken a shine to your boy.
He's very discerning,
doesn't make friends easily.
- RJ is actually the same way.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Really?
Where's he going to school in the fall?
Have you guys taken your tours yet?
- Tours?
- Touring the schools?
Yeah. Go around,
look at them.
- Okay.
- Well, I get a little bit crazy
- about that stuff.
- Yeah, another... It's all coming up.
Just as long as you get
your applications in early, you'll be fine.
If you need a letter of recommendation,
I'm sort of the mayor of this
area, so I can absolutely help you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Cool. Well...
Emelia.
- Alexander.
- All right.
So cool, you guys.
- This is so cool. Welcome.
- Yeah.
- Great.
- Great. Great people.
- All right. See you.
- All right.
- Bye.
- See you.
You know, we have more to discuss.
Tonight is our regular pizza night.
We could turn it into a
"welcome to the neighborhood" get-together.
I can give you the one-on-one
on the schools in the area.
It could be fun.
I'm just throwing it out there.
Yeah, I mean, that's really nice,
but you shouldn't feel obligated.
- Obligated-shmobligated.
- No.
Our boys seem to love each other
and we love making new friends.
It's not an obligation.
It's fun...
- You know, yes. Yeah.
- I...
That actually sounds
like a lot of fun, right?
Yeah. Sure.
And Alex was just talking this morning
about wanting to make new friends.
Get out of here.
Great. Well, why don't you
come over at like 5:00, 5:30?
We're at 1983, Cameron Court.
- Done. Thank you.
- Awesome.
- Awesome. Great.
- That's really nice.
- See you there.
- And listen, do not bring anything.
Just bring yourselves. We have
everything covered, okay? No cheating.
Going to Whole Foods now,
any dietary restrictions?
- I don't think so.
- Screw it.
You guys,
I'm so excited. Yay!
All right.
- See you later, Kurt.
- Bye, buddy.
Wow. He seems cool.
Best case scenario,
I think we just made our first new friends.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Worst case?
We have a boring night and we go home early.
Wow.
That's a pretty nice house.
Up, please.
Sweetie, it's only a little bit further.
- Here. Will you take that?
- Yeah.
Okay. Come here.
Come here.
Want a little bit of a...
What have you been eating?
What's in your belly?
- What the fuck, hon?
- Food!
Food?
- Honey.
- Yeah.
What?
This is Two-Buck Chuck.
We can't bring this to the dinner party.
Why?
Why? 'Cause it's 2 bucks.
It's what we had. I didn't think
it was gonna make a difference.
This is like what
19-year-olds cook with.
Sweetie. It's fine.
It's fine, right?
It's kind of a lame move.
I... I think what you're doing
right now is kind of a lame move.
- Hello!
- Hey.
Welcome, new friends.
I'm Charlotte.
- Hi.
- You must be Alex.
- Come on in. Come on in.
- Okay. Thank you.
I'm just gonna kiss your cheeks.
Okay.
- And you must be Emily.
- Yes.
- Beauty!
- Well, thank you.
Thank you for that.
Let that kid down.
We let them run free here.
All right. There we go.
Hello, sweet pea.
Do you want to eat pizza
until your belly explodes?
- Yeah!
- Yeah?
He's been...
I know someone who's
been waiting to play with him all day long.
- Come on in, please.
- Thank you.
Here you go.
This is from a farm up north.
It's our friend's farm.
- Wow.
- Yeah, that's why there's no label,
'cause they recycle the bottles.
- Okay.
- So... It's organic.
Great. Well,
thank you so much, Alex.
- Great.
- Come on in.
The boys are just finishing their homework.
I'm gonna get you with my horse!
I'm gonna get you with my horse!
All right, last one.
Last one.
Vamos a la biblioteca.
Biblioteca!
- Right. Hey.
- Hey.
Bienvenidos, guys.
- Chau.
- Hey.
Kurt is speaking Spanish with Max
in anticipation for some
work we're gonna be doing in Ecuador.
Wow. That's amazing.
But with me it's mostly French.
You... So, you...
French and Spanish?
Does that ever get confusing for him?
- Do the two...
- No. Keeps him on his toes.
I don't know if
you guys noticed but we've got
a seriously
delicious situation developing here.
- Yeah.
- Yum.
- You guys look great.
- Thanks.
Hey, thank you again for inviting us.
Yeah.
Your house is gorgeous, by the way.
- Thank you.
- It's beautiful.
I'm proud to say that Kurt designed
and rebuilt the entire thing himself.
Well...
It was just an ugly box when we bought it.
Holy cow!
I actually based the entire
design on Charlotte's childhood home
in the south of France.
So is that what you do?
You're an architect?
I've...
I've lived many lives, Alex.
I've been born, died and resurrected
so many times, I can't even tell you.
But...
Can I show you what my passion is now?
I'm really excited about it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Then we'll do pizza.
Here, drink it.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, drink it, taste it.
How does that taste?
. It's... It's really good.
Are you familiar
with desalinization through reverse osmosis?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You are.
Remind me again what it is.
So, that water you're drinking was
processed through a filtering system
that I've been developing
for the past 10 years.
My own personal system.
What's wrong with a...
Like a normal filter?
They only last about 36 hours.
After that,
you're basically drinking liquid cancer.
But with my system,
we're essentially taking spoiled lemons
and making sweet, sweet lemonade.
Like that water that
you're drinking right there,
that was initially sewage.
Pretty amazing, right?
Yeah. So you see how far...
No. No. Alex...
Alex. Alex,
it's beyond clean.
I would not give you disgusting water.
- He's just joking.
- I know he's kidding.
No, it's so good.
- Well, thank you.
- It's really good.
We already have our system set up
in some of the poorest parts of the world.
Like your Cubas, your Northern Pakistans...
Your Central Republic of Africas.
We're taking this bitch village to village.
- My God, just...
- Before you can...
Sometimes the only way
to shut him is to kiss him.
That's not true.
Is that true?
- No, I mean...
- I stop talking.
I'm so proud of you, darling.
- I stop. I stop.
- I'm fucking hungry.
Okay.
Are you hungry?
I'm sure you are.
Are you guys fucking hungry?
- Sure.
- Yeah.
One more piece of pizza
for old tubby over here.
Seriously, buddy, you don't
have to barf to show us you like the food.
Honey, he might have
a point there. I don't know.
Jesus, I feel like
I'm on Intervention or something.
Just let him
have one more piece. He's a growing boy.
Thank you, Charlotte.
You're welcome.
The pizza is yucky.
Doesn't look like you thought it was yucky.
It's so good, you know
what it makes me think about?
What?
Isn't he the funniest?
You know what?
Hold on, I just want to say one
thing. I want to say one thing.
You know, one of our main
worries coming here was
that we wouldn't be able
to meet new people or make new friends,
and I have to say
that tonight you guys really put that to bed.
- And, and, and...
- It's true.
- It is true.
- It's true. He's... Yeah.
And I just want to say, thank you
- for having us into your beautiful home.
- Thank you.
Glad we could be of service.
- All right.
- Cheers.
And, you know what,
speaking of being put to bed...
Yeah, I think we're hitting
the wall here, energy-wise.
- Yeah, it's close.
- Yeah.
It's gonna be all
like scorched earth from here on out.
Yeah.
RJ, are you ready to say goodbye to Max?
Only in America do we let children
dictate when the night is over.
Why don't we put the kids to bed
upstairs and continue down here?
Carry him home later, once we're done.
- Yeah.
- What do you think?
This is a French house.
Yeah, it's a French house.
Well... No...
We'll just get out of here.
We'll just get out of here.
- We want you to stay.
- It's fine.
We want it.
We want it.
- I mean...
- Is that what...
- Yes.
- Settled then. All right.
I'm not done with you two yet.
And as for you two kids.
You come with me upstairs
because I have got a surprise for you.
Who likes surprises?
- Me!
- All right!
Give me 20 minutes
and I will give you parental bliss.
Come on, sit down.
- Wait for me!
- Got it.
- What do you think?
- I mean...
Why not?
Can't sleep.
Kurt's got it.
Just give it a second.
Trust me on this.
- Night-night.
- Good night.
Un-fucking-believable.
Pretty amazing people, babe?
Best case scenario?
I love you.
Night-night.
Sleep tight, boys.
- That was amazing.
- I've never seen... You know...
anything like that.
What is your guys' nighttime
routine with the kid?
Well, I mean,
it starts with some stories, usually.
- This is his area of expertise.
- You're the story...
- I read the stories.
- He's the story reader.
- I'm reading Harry Potter now.
- Wow.
- He loves it.
- And he stays with it and everything?
Yeah. I mean, there's some stuff
that I have to explain to him.
How many pages a night do you read?
- Like, three or four hundred.
- Wow.
- Yeah. No. We do...
- He's joking.
I was just joking.
No. I was joking. I'm sorry.
I never know when it's a joke or not.
I take people very seriously. I'm sorry.
By the way, I don't know what you did
up there, but that was amazing.
- It was.
- I'm on board with whatever that was.
Well, it's not just me, you know.
It's a dance, really.
You've just got to listen to their
bodies to see where they're coming from.
- Right. Right.
- You know?
- Yes.
- It's always a touchy thing, though,
because you don't want to step
on another parent's turf.
Right. But, I mean, we felt...
You know. I was a little bit hesitant.
Listen. I saw what was happening,
but there is not a kid in the world
that can say no to incense, stargazer,
and a little bit of the...
I mean, we've learned something tonight.
It was pretty amazing.
- He's a magician.
- Can I tell you something, first of all?
My mentality was your mentality.
This idea of, you know, the children.
We follow them.
We... we're at their every whim.
- They yawn, put them to bed.
- Right.
But really it was Charlotte
who kind of blew my mind wide open
as far as, you're the parent,
they're the child.
And... And they're younger than you
for a reason.
- Wow.
- You know?
We may take part of this home.
- Yeah, exactly.
- It works.
Anyway...
You are a man of many talents.
I am.
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.
- So, Charlotte...
- You're the best.
You know, I'm realizing
as we're sitting here
that we've been together all night
and I haven't yet asked you what you...
- Yeah.
- What you're up to these days?
Charlotte's between things at the moment.
- Yeah. I am.
- Okay.
I mean, right now my main job is mom.
Most important job of all.
I know exactly what you're talking about.
Well, thank you, Alex.
Thank you.
What do you...
What do you mean by that?
I just...
No, I just mean, like...
You know, I very much respect the mom job
because I've been home with RJ and...
Really?
Yeah. I meant it as
a compliment to all the moms out there.
Yes, yes.
It's beautiful that you're
making those sacrifices
so that Emily can pursue her career.
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
But you need to find
ways to nurture your soul at the same time.
And how do you do that, babe?
I have my hobbies.
Charlotte's working part time as a masseuse.
- Well, I'm dabbling.
- Yeah.
- That's cool.
- But, you know what?
She's actually...
She's more than that.
She's a fabulous actress.
- Really?
- Now, that is cool.
That's so nuts.
I swear to God, right
when I walked in here that's exactly...
Like I looked at you and I thought,
"She's so beautiful, she must be
- "an actress or a model or something."
- Thank you.
- You did?
- And I was right!
I mean I haven't done it in a long time.
My God!
That's so crazy.
It's hard because her French agent
is not here, so it's a little bit...
It is hard.
We've never met a real actress before.
- Is there...
- You've never met and actor before?
- No!
- No. I don't think so.
I think this is our...
Yes, it's... It's our first...
Is there anything
that we might be able to see, maybe?
Yes. Yeah.
No, we don't have any...
- You do.
- I see...
I think somebody might be giving it away.
- We're movie buffs.
- Yeah. We watch...
We've probably seen it, so...
I'm grabbing it.
- Yes!
- Yay!
See, this is truly
exciting for us. So...
Really, thank you.
I mean, I hope you're
not gonna be disappointed.
Well, I don't think that's possible.
What are you
talking about? This is great stuff.
Fasten your seat belts.
We're really proud of
Charlotte's work in this one.
So I think if we just begin...
- Yeah?
- By opening your shirt. Do you mind?
- No. I don't.
- With me, right?
It's all very simple, right?
- We just unbutton your shirt, right?
- Yeah.
You could do it
anywhere. Really.
You could do it
in a restaurant, at home, right?
Yeah.
Okay, and if you
want to just bring your breasts out for me.
Yeah.
And if you want to
start by massaging in some circular motions.
You want to take your
flange or breastshields.
And you just
want to place them right on your nipples.
Get just the perfect latch there, right?
Then you'll turn your machine on.
- Yeah.
- And it will just start sucking, right?
Hey-o!
You want to really...
See, if you don't feel...
Well. You get
the picture.
But I am proud to say
that this DVD was included
with all the breast pumps
that this company sold from 2005 to 2008.
That was a great
plain breast pump. You guys keep it.
- Thanks.
- It's a gift. Keep it.
So we'll take it home with us?
Yeah. It's a gift.
- Watch it at your own leisure.
- Thanks.
It was awesome.
Please.
Thank you.
You looked very beautiful in it.
I mean, it's...
I tried to stay natural.
It... It was very natural.
Wow. Well...
Thank you, Alex.
I really appreciate that.
You know what?
I've got the perfect thing
for this moment, right now.
Sweetie, would you get
them some more red wine?
- I'm gonna get something from upstairs.
- Yeah.
You guys, just chill.
Sweetie?
I'm gonna get some wine.
We have no more wine.
Okay, that sounds like a great idea.
Okay.
What?
Honey.
This is California.
Maybe this is what dinner parties are like.
How am I supposed to know?
I mean, up until then it was fine.
- Like they were great, right?
- What was great?
Kurt was playing music...
They were great or her breasts were great?
Please.
- I love your boobs.
- Stop.
I love your boobs very much.
Twelve months of breast feeding a child
has completely decimated my breasts.
I worship them.
I worship them
like they're two little Jesuses,
on your chest.
- Hey!
- Hey.
I just checked on the boys.
They're just so cute.
Great.
They look like little brothers.
I mean, I'm so happy to know
that Max has a new buddy.
You guys smoke pot, right?
- No.
- Yeah.
Holy... Holy cow!
- Wow!
- Wow!
See, I don't know
if he knows how to do it, the same way...
Are you gonna give it a shot?
Honey.
You did it!
- Come here.
- Can't see shit, man.
Here, take my hand.
- You're all right?
- Yeah.
- Hit your head?
- No.
Okay, come here.
All right. This is what I wanted to show you.
Is this like your office or something?
I guess you could
say that. Here.
Wow.
All this...
This is how I keep my sanity.
Painting first entered
my life when I was around RJ and Max's age.
What started out as dipping
my fingers in the tips of the
acrylics blossomed into all this.
My refuge.
It's how I can truly express myself.
Is that...
Is that what I think it is?
Very perceptive of you.
- That's...
- You can say it.
- A butt hole?
- Yeah.
This series is called Portals.
Each of them painted from life.
I was lucky enough to have
some of my best friends
donate their time as models.
Even Charlotte's up here somewhere.
Fifty bucks if you can guess
which one's mine.
Butt hole?
Well.
That one.
That's amazing.
Really? Is that...
That's... That's yours?
- That's me.
- Great.
- That's me.
- That's great.
Do you paint?
Yeah. No.
I always wanted to, though,
because I always felt like...
I always felt like I could.
Yeah.
Like I feel like if I did it,
it would be, really...
Great.
- No question.
- Yeah.
- Do you think...
- I think there's never...
- Never an excuse not to try this.
- Yeah.
'Cause these are amazing.
I think you could do it.
And if you ever want,
you can borrow some of my acrylics...
- Really?
- I got everything here.
You can come
paint here with me, for all I care.
I can come here and paint with you?
Bring RJ over, let him play upstairs,
we can sit out here and paint.
You know what, I'm gonna start painting.
I think I'm gonna start painting.
You are painting.
You are painting.
I'm gonna be a painter.
You are a painter.
You're great.
I feel like I just, like, made a decision.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.
- Yeah.
My God, this house is just amazing!
I mean, I'm...
I'm lost already.
You'll get used to it.
- This is my bedroom.
- Okay.
Wow!
My God!
These cookies are
so incredible right now.
Yeah.
I love these cookies.
You know, you can't find them in France.
No.
And there's so many ways to eat them.
So many tasty combinations.
You know, I never thought
that I would be surrounded by boys.
I know the feeling.
Don't get me wrong.
I love it.
I think it's great.
I just think that it can be
just downright kind of
nasty sometimes. Like...
I really find myself
craving feminine energy.
What's this area?
This is just another
creative spot in the place.
- It's a photography zone.
- Cool.
It's where I take
all the pictures of the models who come in.
The people that pose for the...
Yeah, they come in,
take the photos, print the photos,
I can blow them up to any size I want,
'cause as you can see,
some of it's extremely detailed.
- You just paint based off of the photos?
- Yeah.
- That makes sense, yeah.
- Yeah.
Or I'll have them come in
and take pictures of me.
Right, when you...
Yeah, a lot of them
are self-portraits.
This is neat.
The whole carpet, backdrop...
- Do this.
- Lights.
- Do that. Do you feel that?
- Yeah.
I was at the park with Max one day,
and I was like,
"God, this floor feels so nice here." All
the kids, and they can bounce on it.
So, I found out what it was,
and I had the whole room done in it.
- It's nice, right?
- Yeah.
It's so much easier on the knees.
When I'm painting,
I spend sometimes eight to twelve hours
on my feet. So, all this is just...
It's great. I mean, feel this.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Isn't it funny? Isn't that weird?
Isn't it weird to feel, like you only
know this texture from being outside,
but to have it inside is cool, right?
It feels like...
Like a good creative environment.
It's the best. Really.
You can't get hurt in here.
- Really?
- Yeah. It's a safe, free zone.
Yeah. I feel safe in here.
I feel like I could do anything in here,
and I'd be fine. You know?
You want my advice, Emily?
Yeah.
You need to create your own space.
One that is only yours.
Mine, is this bedroom.
And Kurt's okay with that?
He's okay with all the girly stuff in here?
No, no, no, no.
This isn't Kurt's bedroom at all.
No. This is my bedroom.
I'm sorry.
I just assumed that you guys were...
It's totally fine, you know.
It all started with him taking too
much time in the bathroom and then,
I couldn't sleep
with his breathing noises, but it's...
It's all for the best.
I love it.
You love it?
So you sleep in here alone?
This bedroom is mine.
It's only mine.
And there are things that I do in my bedroom
that no one needs to know about.
You know you've got a really great look.
Anybody ever tell you that?
No.
You've got a really neat thing going on.
Mind if I snap a couple?
I think I might need some direction or...
You don't. Just do whatever
you were just doing, it was great.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's great. Relax.
- Like that?
- Yeah.
- Wait.
- Okay.
Your shirt's kind of
blending in with the backdrop.
Would you take it off, please?
- My shirt?
- Yeah.
All right.
You know, I would put money
on my husband just being
passed out on the floor right now.
He usually has a bit of trouble
keeping it together when he smokes weed.
He seemed fine to me.
We'll see.
One time in college...
he thought that he was
breathing out of his ears
and he had a panic attack.
Be careful. Careful.
I'm serious. He did that.
- Like that?
- That's great, yeah.
That feels weird, like...
But you know what, it's weird in
real life, it's great on camera.
Yeah. You're looking for...
Hey!
- Hey, guys. Hi.
- Hey!
- What's up?
- See?
- I told you that he was gonna...
- It's okay, don't worry.
- What's up?
- Hey.
What are you...
- What are you guys...
- What we were doing was
just getting to the good part.
You were getting to the good part?
What does that mean?
It's okay.
It's just painting.
Yeah, hon, did you know
that Kurt was a painter?
- No!
- Painted all these beautiful paintings.
- Yeah.
- I didn't know that.
And, he's a photographer too, which is...
Why were you on the ground?
There's nothing to worry about, Emily.
We were just freestyling.
We got into a mood and we just went with it.
Yeah.
You're ridiculous.
Hey.
I've got a proposal to make.
My proposal's this...
That swimming pool out there
has about 10,000 gallons
of the freshest filtered water imaginable.
You can drink it.
It's got healing powers.
Now I think we all need to get in that pool
and let the fucking healing begin.
I mean, who's with me?
- What do you guys think?
- I am with you.
Come on!
Come on, guys!
Let's go!
- Come on.
- Okay.
Hey!
I'm coming, baby.
Come on, you guys.
- Normally, we would...
- Yeah.
We forgot to bring our suits with us.
No suits in the house, au naturel.
My...
- Okay.
- Feels so good.
You've got good form on that...
Are we gonna
do this? I don't know...
There's nothing
to discuss. House rules.
All right, we'll probably come in.
We just need to, like...
Take a minute.
Just... We just
need to take a minute.
We're gonna have
a conversation, super quick.
Shouldn't...
Okay, look. Listen,
I'm like super fucked-up right now.
I know.
- Are you fucked up?
- Yeah.
Come in here.
I think there might have been
angel dust in that weed.
Are you serious?
- I'm joking.
- Okay.
- So there's no angel dust?
- No. No.
That's not funny, because... I'm serious
when I think about angel dust.
It freaks me out, because I think about
people, like, jumping off of buildings.
I'm serious. People take angel dust
and they think they can fly.
And they go fucking crazy.
- So, I can't think about that.
- What?
- So, stop.
- Stop it!
I... I need to talk to you
about something serious.
What? What's going on?
I can't go
skinny-dipping with them.
Why? I think you'll
be very excited,
to be in the water
with Charlotte's ta-tas.
That's not what
I'm talking about and you know it.
I... You know, I can't...
You know what I'm talking about.
- Well...
- Honey.
How many times do I have
to reassure you about that?
Come on, guys.
This isn't the G8 Summit.
It wouldn't be so bad
if we didn't just have to see his
giant goddamn horse cock.
- You know?
- It's pretty big.
It's really, really big.
- Listen.
- Okay.
Listen, if you're uncomfortable,
I will absolutely follow your lead.
Okay.
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to.
Well, I'm not going to.
So, we talked and...
We don't want to disrespect
your house rules, but...
- We're not French.
- No.
- So we've never done this before.
- Ever.
And we're just hoping
that underwear is good enough...
Because that's as good as we can...
Yeah. So we hope that
that's okay with you guys.
Absolutely, as long as it's negotiable.
What are you doing?
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Should we race?
Go.
I feel weird.
Whose pool is this?
All right, that's a joke.
I don't know if that's a good idea.
I'm okay! I'm okay!
- My God.
- Buddy.
Overboard. Over...
- Alex!
- Charlotte, help me.
I've got you, Alex.
I've got you. Come.
I've got you.
I've got you, Alex.
It's okay. Don't worry.
Everything's fine.
I've got you, Alex.
- Honey, are you...
- God.
Everything is gonna be fine.
- Are you okay?
- God. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. Don't worry. It's fine.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey. Hey,
stop that nonsense.
You think this is the first time
somebody's yacked near the pool?
- No, it's not.
- Honey...
You want to go home, honey?
No. I want to
stay here forever.
Are you sure, honey?
I think you kind of almost died in the pool.
I ruined everything.
I don't want to be a party pooper.
No, you didn't.
No, he's right. He doesn't
want to be a party pooper.
You know what? I've got
the perfect thing for you.
We're gonna get you cleaned up
and calmed down, okay?
- Yeah.
- Let's get him up, over here.
Thanks, man.
Sweetie.
Are you sure that that's a good idea?
Yeah, puke and rally.
- Remember?
- Right.
Puke and rally was our slogan in college.
First year,
"Puke and rally."
That's my guy, everybody.
Mr. Puke and Rally.
Just do us a favor, okay?
And if you're...
Listen to your body,
and if you're starting to feel
like you might throw up again
just let us all know.
- Okay?
- Okay.
I will listen to my body.
- Thanks, honey.
- Hey, can I say something?
Something's been bothering me.
I don't mean to offend you,
I only say this out of concern.
What's with the whole nudity thing?
Yeah. I hope it's not
because of us, is it?
No, no, no.
You guys are great.
- Okay.
- What is it, man?
I just feel like there's some kind
of a weird judgment going on.
No, there is no judgment.
No judgment at all.
No. It's just...
It's my problem.
- I... No.
- It is.
I wouldn't call it a problem.
Honey, you don't have to cover for me.
It's not a problem,
it's just that we're
not totally comfortable.
It's not her problem.
Okay. It's...
You don't have to do this.
No, it's me.
I have a body issue.
- Honey, you don't...
- Why wouldn't I do this?
- I don't... I just...
- What?
We don't know, you know.
We don't know what?
We don't know where we are?
I know where I am.
I'm in a hot tub.
I do know that, too.
And I'm in with these wonderful people.
And why not say I have a body issue?
I just say...
You just say the words, you know.
- What's the issue?
- Yeah.
I have an abnormally small dick.
- I have an abnormally small dick!
- Okay,
- Sweetheart...
- I do. It's...
As long as I can remember.
Hey...
Tiny dick. There it is.
That's okay, man.
Is it Kurt? Really?
I've seen your dick, man.
I don't think you know
what I'm talking about.
Okay?
No, no...
Well, Alex, what Kurt means
is that you're in a safe place.
You can talk to us.
Honey, you know
that it doesn't mean anything to me.
It doesn't matter to me.
Right, 'cause the circles, right?
I make circles, everything's okay.
It's like I have
a big old ding-dong.
I've... All I have to do
is take it and move it around in circles
and it's like it's like that big.
- Is that...
- Honey...
Right? That's what
this is about, right?
Because of circles
all our problems are solved.
Sorry, guys. I'm...
Hey, Alex?
- What?
- There is nothing to be sorry about.
- We all love you.
- We do.
You don't have to hold this in anymore.
You know,
I didn't even
know it was small until middle school.
Like...
In PE class I would just see
guys changing and I would...
Like, I knew something was wrong.
But I didn't...
Like, I asked my parents
about it and they were like,
"Well, you'll hit
puberty and it'll grow."
You know?
But it just...
It didn't. It never did. It never grew.
So I still have this, like,
dick from middle school
on my body.
I'm so goddamn proud of you right now.
You have a spark in you.
I saw it the first time
I laid eyes on you, you've got a...
It's like you have a blinding aura
of goodness and love
surrounding you at all times.
- It fucking follows you around.
- Come on.
I'm not just waxing your car here, man.
You've got something special.
You need to share with the world.
- Okay.
- See that girl over there?
She loves you for
who you are, with every sense of her being.
You guys are gonna grow
old and die together on a porch somewhere.
I mean, it's big.
Yeah.
And there is a wild card
in the situation too.
If I know my wife,
I can tell when she likes someone
and she thinks you're the bee's knees.
Really?
Yeah, everybody...
You're loved.
I want you to stop moping
around like a little bitch,
you take that thing, you own it,
and you get the fuck out there
and you show me
what the fuck you're made out of.
You're a stud.
You're a studhorse, Alex.
- Don't you ever forget that.
- Okay.
- All right?
- Okay.
- I'm serious.
- Yeah. I'm a studhorse.
You're a studhorse.
Ladies and ladies,
can I have your full attention please?
Girls, get the biggest towel you got,
'cause your pussies
are about to be dripping wet.
Prepare yourselves
to bear witness to the beautiful,
the lovely, the one, the only...
Alex!
Hoo!
Yes, yes, yes!
Yes!
My God!
- Yes!
- Yes!
That was fucking fun!
Thank you! Thanks!
Your husband is a really brave man.
Yes!
I feel like I just gave birth to myself.
And...
- Honey...
- Yeah?
I am very happy for you,
that you were able to have your little,
like, breakthrough over there,
but I think we've reached
that point in the evening
where we should leave
before anything crazy happens.
What are you talking about?
We can't leave.
Sweetie, I'm just
telling you this because I don't think
that you're firing on
all cylinders right now.
I'm not only firing on all cylinders.
I am firing on cylinders
I didn't even know I had.
Honey, I'm pretty sure
that we have moved from,
freewheeling, sort of California vibe
to more of a swinger vibe.
That's what it feels like to me.
No, I... I don't
think so at all, like...
I mean, I, I...
I really went through something over there.
I feel like more confident
than I've ever felt in my entire life.
It's... It's... It's...
It feels so good, hon.
Well, I mean, of course,
you're feeling good right now.
You're drunk and you're stoned.
Well, you're drunk and stoned, too.
I am drunk and stoned,
but I am not the one who
was dancing around with my pants off.
Well, there you go.
Maybe that's the problem.
Maybe that's what you should do.
- Excuse me?
- Maybe you should get naked.
Alex, I don't really think that this is
a box you want to open right now.
Okay, what I'm
saying is I... I love my dick.
- Okay.
- Do you understand
how big a deal it is for me to say that?
- Okay.
- Like I really feel that.
Like, I love it.
I mean, Kurt brought me to this place
where I can actually
say something like that.
And that's huge.
You think I want to leave
this place right now?
That's crazy.
I mean, I feel like this is
so good for our sex life,
for our everything.
Emily...
I am expanding tonight.
Maybe you should expand too.
It might be good for you.
We're out, guys. Looks like
we're gonna need a booze run.
Emily, you want to come with?
- Yeah.
- I know a place that's open all night.
Okay.
Will you get me
something brown and hardcore?
I think I'm going for the hard stuff now.
It's that time of night.
Char, there's like
five bottles of whiskey back there.
Yeah. I know.
Are you coming?
We're in our most
downward-facing dog style positions.
Somehow she's able to reach around
and do it from the back.
I mean, that is an extremely flexible woman.
- No doubt.
- Yeah,
I could only last three
or four minutes before I lost it completely.
It was like her pussy was grabbing me.
I hate to throw her under the bus.
You've never seen anything like it before.
- My God!
- I feel like crazy, nasty sex
is a mandatory class
at French college or something.
I mean...
There's nothing we haven't tried.
Charlotte, why am I driving your car?
I don't know how to drive.
Are you gonna tell me where we're going?
It's a secret.
Now, you know what I mean.
You're a married man.
Yeah.
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah, totally.
It's like that expression,
"Show me a guy with a beautiful wife,"
"I'll show you a guy
who's tired of making love to her."
I think what I'm trying to say is that...
I mean, isn't it okay for us
to fantasize at this stage
in our lives and relationships?
I mean, aren't we entitled
to a little bit of that?
- Yeah.
- It's okay for you
to want to think about doing other things
and in some cases,
consider doing those things.
Right.
You know.
- You only live once.
- Yeah.
This way.
Okay. I've got
something to show you.
All you've got to do is look through here.
I'll be quick.
Charlotte, you're not gonna tell me
what the fuck is going on right now?
Don't ruin the surprise.
What surprise?
Charlotte, where are you going?
This is pretty weird.
Charlotte? Charlotte?
Are you fucking...
Are you kidding me?
Charlotte? Charlotte?
I knew you wouldn't come
if I had told you where we were going.
I'm kind of out of my mind
right now, Charlotte.
I mean, that was...
That was...
That was nuts,
what happened in there, right?
Try being married for 10 years,
and then you'll tell me what's nuts.
That just doesn't make any sense to me.
I've seen you guys together,
you have insane sex chemistry.
I wish.
I mean...
Does Kurt know about this?
No.
Why should he?
It wouldn't change anything.
Anyway, it's a bummer, 'cause...
Kurt has a lot to offer.
As I'm sure you saw.
Yeah.
You know I'm the only guy
Emily's ever been with?
- No shit?
- Yeah.
I mean, I guess she's satisfied.
I mean, she said she
has everything she needs under one roof.
What?
- Come on. You're not...
- What?
Well, it's just, you know...
Well, a woman is always gonna wonder
what's going on next door.
They're just sometimes scared to admit it.
Scared to open that delicious little box.
What took so long?
Was the journey a success?
Yeah. The place
I usually go to was closed,
so, we had to bounce around a bit.
All right.
Did you get the stuff?
- Yeah, I did.
- Let's see.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.
- Honey. Honey.
- What?
There's some seriously
weird shit that just went down out there.
What now?
What do you...
What do you mean, "What now?"
I mean, you think
everything's weird tonight.
So, what now?
I don't think everything's weird tonight.
You brought me to California, okay?
So I'm trying to make the best of it
and you're shitting all over everything.
- Alex.
- What?
Alex, you're really being
kind of a dick right now.
I'm trying...
Daddy, Mama!
You know what?
Don't worry about it. I'll get it.
- Okay.
- Daddy will get that.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
All right.
You go, boy!
Hey, if it's Max who's crying
and he doesn't remember you,
just remind him who you are.
Emily, can I get you a stiff one?
Please.
My God!
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Yes. It's fine.
Can I talk to you?
Of course.
Come and sit on my bed.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Okay.
Right now?
Well, this is...
This is nice. Is that fan from...
Is that a French fan, or did you...
- I think it's Portuguese.
- A Portuguese fan.
I wouldn't have guessed that.
But it's... It's very nice.
It must keep the room...
Circulate the air.
Yeah. I mean, you know,
it's... Nothing's regular here.
I get it.
- Yeah. Everything is special.
- Yeah.
This is...
You got a couch and a...
Like a love seat-type thing,
I think that's...
It must be handy.
Yeah, yeah.
You know, depending on what
mood you're in, I guess for...
For reading a novel or something,
I would imagine it's really...
It's very cozy.
- It is, right?
- I'll say, yeah. Cozy.
Yeah, and you're wearing the perfect outfit.
This cozy robe.
That's right.
Yeah, thanks for showing it to me.
This is great.
So...
And these ones here,
they just came to me in a dream one night.
What happened was like,
I woke up one morning and bam!
A voice fucking yelling in my ears.
Kurt...
Yes, ma'am?
I don't want to talk about
your paintings anymore.
- What do you want to talk about?
- I want to talk about you.
And I want to talk about your wife.
And I want to talk about
what is going on here.
Okay.
What do you do?
You're a salesman of water filters?
And you can somehow afford
this house doing that?
Or do you make all this money
selling these paintings?
Which, Kurt, I've got to say, what are they?
Are they supposed
to be close-ups of assholes or what?
That's so funny. Both you and your
husband got that immediately.
I feel like I need to clear
some things up for you.
Yes. Please do.
Clarity sounds just great to me.
In some places, Nordic places,
where the winters
are cold and long and it gets dark early,
people like to masturbate to this.
And not only this,
but lots of the titles that we have
available in our Mommy's Milk series.
I'm here to
present you the new breast Pumpadella 2000.
You know, I can see in Kurt's eyes
that he really enjoys both of you.
Especially you.
Yeah?
I think you're gonna be his new buddy.
- That's great. Thank you.
- Yeah.
Emily and I are gonna be buddies too.
Don't you think so?
Yeah. I mean,
I hope so.
I'm sorry if she's like...
Like tight or something.
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yes, a little bit.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I mean, I've been
encouraging her to loosen up.
Yeah.
But there's only so much
you can do, you know.
Yeah, I can totally understand that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But...
Yeah, 'cause I really like her.
Cool!
That's great.
- I really like her.
- Cool, cool, cool. Yeah. Yeah.
- Well...
- And I like you too, Alex.
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah.
- Do you like me?
- Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, you know...
Do you find me attractive?
Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Sure, yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Of course. I mean,
you're very attractive.
Do you think that,
if we weren't already married,
that I could be someone,
with whom you'd want to have sex?
Well...
Yes.
Yeah.
But, you know, we can't, so...
The milk is then filtered
from the breastshield
into the retainer.
Where we have produced some beautiful,
nurturing milk
for the little baby to enjoy.
- Kurt...
- Sun Tzu.
This is pretty fucked up.
Come on, Emily.
The Internet's a vast sea of depravity.
You know that.
What we're producing simply fulfills
a niche without anybody getting hurt.
- No harm, no foul...
- So you're telling me
that there are hundreds
of strange Nordic men masturbating
to your wife and you have
no problem with that?
No, I don't.
And Charlotte has no problem with that?
Something tells me you would know
that Charlotte doesn't
have a problem with that.
We're buddies.
- Yeah, yeah. We're buddies.
- So, we can't...
- We're buddies.
- Yeah.
- We're buddies.
- We're buddies.
You are tense, sweetheart.
- You're really tense.
- I know... I...
I thought we wanted to loosen up.
Yeah, no, I do, I want to loosen up,
but I guess I'm just wondering
what "loosen up" means
at this point.
It's just a friends' kiss.
It's just a friends' kiss?
It's just a friends' kiss.
- It's just a friends' kiss.
- Yeah.
Hello? Guys?
Alex?
- Honey?
- Guys?
Alex?
That's the spot.
What did that sound like to you?
Don't know.
- There they are.
- Hey, honey!
I just want to say, I think you were right,
I think there is something
weird going on here.
Yeah, no shit.
I have seen that woman give massages before.
What?
Alex, she gave some random guy
a fucking hand job at the massage parlor.
You guys went to a massage parlor?
When did you do that?
I can't even... Just...
Were you gonna let her touch you down there?
Honey! Absolutely not.
I was just saying that I think you're right.
I think they do want to, like,
swing with us or something
and that is pretty crazy.
Well, lucky you. See?
You got your expansion now.
This is what you wanted all night.
I was talking about
getting crazy with friends
and meeting new people and having fun
and maybe getting drunk or whatever.
I didn't mean, like,
fucking-other-people expansion.
That's not what I...
But you can't tell me
you wouldn't have liked it, okay?
I can't... I mean,
that's irrelevant.
- I don't think it is.
- Yes, it is.
- I don't think that that's irrelevant at all.
- Why not?
Stop. Let's just be brutally
honest here for a second.
- Okay.
- Okay?
What would have happened
if she had grabbed for your cock...
And I hadn't have been there?
I wouldn't have allowed it.
Because you wouldn't have
liked it if she had done it?
Because I am married to you,
I wouldn't have allowed it.
It's simple.
My God, isn't that the perfect answer?
Well, I don't know,
maybe it is the perfect answer.
- That's how I feel.
- That tells me, that tells me...
What you just said
tells me that the desire is still there.
That tells me that a part of you
thinks about what
it would be like to be with other women.
Come on! I mean... Honey...
My God!
Not that I think you would act on it.
I mean, I trust you, I do.
I really do. I really...
I really trust you, but I think it just...
It bothers me so much that
that curiosity is there
and it may never go away.
It just might always live...
Live there.
I never said I was curious.
Honey, I never said I was curious.
Wait a second.
I'm really tired.
I'm feeling really tired.
- No, no, no.
- Let's just get out...
This is not the time
for this conversation...
This is actually about you, isn't it?
Honey, let's just get out of here.
This is about you.
This isn't about me,
this is about you,
you've been putting it all on me all night.
- What?
- You're the one...
That's been thinking about this, isn't it?
The moment he whipped that thing out,
you haven't been able
to stop thinking about it.
- You're curious...
- Maybe I am curious, okay?
- Really? Really?
- Maybe I am.
I feel that it's weird
that we have to jerk off
next to each other to come.
And I really think that it sucks that you
lust after another woman's breasts.
This is a real thing
and I don't think that we can deny it.
I think that you think about other women
and I think about other men.
- Alex?
- Do you want to fuck my wife?
- Stop it, Alex!
- I'm not gonna stop it. I want to know.
Do you want to fuck my wife?
'Cause I'm telling you,
she wants to fuck you.
She does.
I think you're a little
off-base here, Alex.
You think I'm off-base?
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
Kurt!
Tell me, why did you show us
your dick down at the pool?
- Okay.
- Your giant cock!
Why did you show that to us?
Why did you show my wife your big dick?
And then why did you have
me stand next to you
with my tiny dick?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
And what?
What does this mean? I get Charlotte now?
So, me and Charlotte?
- Is that cool?
- Alex! No!
Is that why you showed us that weird
video of you showing your tits to us.
- We like you both very much.
- Is that what this is?
But we didn't want this to be weird.
You didn't want it to be weird.
- No.
- Okay.
My mistake because,
then, you're right, this isn't weird.
This is fine. So...
Now that it's not weird,
honey, why don't you
lay down, you have to take your clothes off.
What do you want?
Missionary?
Let's do it
right here. Kurt?
Why don't you get out your big old cock
and just shove it right in her.
- That's enough.
- How about that?
- That's enough.
- You don't have to do circles anymore,
- because it's big. We've all seen it.
- That's enough.
He doesn't want her, Alex!
He wants you!
What?
He wants you.
We still love each other very, very much,
but we've been together
for a long time and...
Things have changed.
I don't know why,
but, you know, step-by-step,
Kurt's desire for me just disappeared,
and he seemed
to want something that I couldn't give him.
When he saw you
this morning at the playground,
he saw sweetness on your faces
and he thought that maybe
this could be the solution.
For both of us.
Isn't there like
a web community for something like this?
No, we've never done this before.
- Could have fooled us.
- Yeah.
Then you think
that we're doing a smooth job of this?
Does it look like we do this all the time?
- Yeah.
- Kind of.
It's our first time.
It's just a total mistake.
It just doesn't make any sense.
It's obvious that you love each other
- so much.
- Yeah.
She's my best friend.
We just don't have a love life.
- Yeah.
- We stay together for everything else.
Max, the house, the water filter company.
I'm sorry, I feel like a dick.
Why do you feel like a dick?
Well...
You're not a dick.
You're not, you know, you just didn't know.
You got excited.
And I wasn't putting
my dick next to your dick
to, like, do anything,
I was just dancing with you, man.
All right, thanks.
Think about this.
Less than 24 hours ago,
we were a park together
as complete strangers.
- That's true.
- It is.
Now we're here
and you're in one of my robes.
- You have so many robes, by the way.
- I know.
- Yeah, we got them in bulk.
- There's enough for all of us.
How many did you buy?
- Twelve.
- Twelve robes?
I got a 12-pack of robes.
- My God.
- That was a good one.
Hey, Charlotte.
Tell us how...
How did you lose your virginity?
I feel like you would have been
like on an island in southern France
with a pencil-thin
mustachioed aristocrat or something.
Look at you, why do you stereotype so much?
Because I'm racist.
Yeah. Exactly.
Well, you're not that far,
but it was a farm boy.
On an island in southern France?
On an island, in the south of France.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah...
So I totally got it right.
What about you, Emily?
How did you lose your virginity?
Alex is the first person...
Person I ever slept with.
He was your farm boy.
- I'm your farm boy.
- He was my farm boy.
I am a farm boy.
He still is my farm boy.
Are you my...
You're my, kind of, like my farm boy?
He'll always be me farm boy.
Where would you want to go
anywhere in the world?
You know, I really wanna see...
I've never been to Thailand.
- I've gone.
- I hear they have beautiful beaches.
Did you guys ever see that movie.
The Beach with Leonardo...
- I love that movie...
- That makes me
not wanna go to Thailand.
But they shot it there, right?
Yeah, they did.
That's all I have to say.
Can I say something that is so weird?
Can I just say something,
and not to keep bringing up,
like kicking a dead horse here?
- Yeah.
- But...
The whole water filter thing came
from watching the movie The Beach.
What?
I said, "Why can't they
drink water like we can?"
From The Beach?
- That movie?
- What does he say?
And I just brought that movie up?
- It's too weird.
- That's so crazy.
Guys, I think this night
was sort of meant to be.
- That's like...
- There's a lot of synchronicity.
Our stars right now are a constellation.
- I know...
- Yes.
What would our constellation be called?
Shit!
What time is it?
I have my phone.
- What? 4:00? 5:00, I think?
- 4:00?
You guys!
- It's almost 6:00 a.m.
- What?
All right.
This has been fun.
- I have to work today.
- God.
- I have to go to work today.
- Yes.
I know, we gotta go.
Really, time to go.
So, this is it.
We're gonna call it?
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah.
That can't be the last time we get together.
No way. We'll...
We'll do something.
Yeah.
Yeah, certainly the
strangest night of my life.
But it's also been very expanding.
Yeah. I feel good.
I mean, I'm exhausted, but I feel good.
Yeah, me, too.
Me three.
Count me in.
All right.
Good night.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You... You...
I'm sorry.
Emily?
So many hugs.
Yeah, I know.
You're welcome.
- Hey, group hug.
- Yes.
Thank you.
Okay.
- Thank you.
- This is nice.
It's really nice.
It's nice.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Shit!
Under the covers!
- Mommy?
- Hey, guys, hey!
Wow! Morning!
How'd you guys sleep?
- Hey, who wants breakfast?
- Me!
Yeah, let's go.
I'll get it for you.
Come on, it's a beautiful day.
Were you guys wrestling?
- Fuck!
- Yeah, we were just wrestling.
- Who won?
- It was a tie.
God! Get your...
Get dressed!
Get dressed! Get dressed! Get...
Medium dogs are pussies.
No, I saw the other day...
Okay.
But earlier today, did you not see
the schnauzer that was here earlier?
- Yeah.
- You know what a...
- Yeah, I like...
- His hair, it's hypoallergenic.
I enjoy a good
schnauzer every now and again.
Yeah, but I think that could be fun.
- They're not small...
- But are you hearing...
Are you hearing me
when I say if you're gonna get a dog,
you should get a dog.
- Go big or go home.
- Yes.
I want RJ to grow up with a big dog.
My gosh, do you see them?
Shit. Holy...
- My God.
- Okay.
Do you think it's time we do this?
I guess so.
Should we go say hi?
I mean, it was inevitable, right, so...
- Do they see us?
- Yeah, yeah. Now they did.
- Yeah, all right.
- Get up.
- Hey, guys...
- Hey!
You don't write,
you don't call, you're breaking my heart.
Sorry, I'm just kidding, dumb joke.
- How are ya?
- Good.
- Good. Yeah.
- How are you guys?
It's good, it's really...
We're in therapy.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Sorry to be
the one to cut the crap here, but...
Basically we've decided
to give the marriage another chance.
We've been able to sort
through a ton of stuff.
That sounds great.
We've got you guys to thank for that.
- Yeah.
- Without that experience
we'd be lost, really.
Thank you,
you walked us down the aisle to this moment.
It was a crazy experience.
- But it was, you know...
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- It was valuable.
Yes.
Yeah.
It's good to see you guys.
Thank you, you too.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah, you've changed something in your face.
- This is nice.
- You know, it wasn't very California.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
After a while, I was
like, I don't see anyone else doing this.
Maybe I should stop, so...
Right. Right.
You know, I was planning
on calling you guys.
I, you know, was thinking about that.
I just wasn't quite sure what to say.
- So...
- Don't worry about it.
We should grab dinner or something.
- Totally.
- You know?
Yeah, we should,
maybe at your house this time.
Yeah, you could come,
or we could go to a restaurant this time?
- We found some great places.
- Totally. Yeah.
Looks like the boys have kind of
picked up where they left off.
Yes.
- Gettin' dirty.
- Shall we say hi?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Let's go say hi.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Let's do it.
So...
Sold all my art.
All of it?
- Yep.
- Who bought that?
My wife.
