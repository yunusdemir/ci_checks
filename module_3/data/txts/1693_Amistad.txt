Isabella II, Queen of Spain

Your Royal Highness.
Something's happened.
(BAND PLAYS <i>HAIL TO THE CHIEF)</i>
- Thank you...
- Mr. President, sir.
The ambassador to Spain, <i>Señor</i> Calderon.
Martin Van Buren, 8th President of the United States
- What?
<i>- Señor</i> Calderon.
- Yes, all right. Not now. Not now.
- Ambassador...
It appears to be a matter
of certain importance, sir.
God bless!
I'm trying to drink my brandy
after a very long day.
I understand. I simply wasn't certain
whether this was something
- you wanted to take care of personally.
- Leder, there are, what,
three, four million Negroes
in this country?
Why on Earth should I concern myself
with these 44?
Well, there are reasons.
I don't care how. You just take care of it.
JOADSON: The ship is the <i>Amistad.</i>
It's too small to be
a transatlantic slaver.
TAPPAN: So, they're plantation slaves,
then? West Indians?
JOADSON: Not necessarily.
At least they certainly don't look it.
Not from the glimpse I caught of them
on their way to jail.
They have these scars.
- TAPPAN: Scars?
- Yeah.
(CHURCH BELL STRIKES)
They were first detained by officers of a
survey brig off the coast of Long Island.
They were conveyed to New Haven,
under what authority, I don't know,
and given over to the local constabulary.
About 40 of them,
including four or five children.
The arraignment is day after tomorrow.
I can only assume
that the charge is murder.
TAPPAN: I'll see
what I can do about that.
Perhaps a writ for illegal arrest
and detainment to stall things.
At the very least,
make sure they have good counsel.

<i>In the matter of the district court
of the United States of America</i>
in this, the year of our Lord, 1839,
the honorable
Andrew T. Juttson presiding.
(PRISONERS MUTTER)
If it please Your Honor.
JUTTSON: The bench recognizes
District Attorney Holabird.
I would like to present the court,
Your Honor, with the charges
- of piracy and murder against the...
- Your Honor, I have a petition
- for a writ of habeas corpus.
- Your Honor, I was speaking.
Yes, I know, Mr. Holabird.
You were reading charges, which,
whatever they might be,
will be rendered moot by this writ.
That petition for a writ, Mr. Tappan,
if, indeed, that's what it is, is moot
- unless and until an actual writ
- (SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE)
by some higher court,
by some miracle, is granted.
JUTTSON: Mr. Holabird is correct,
Mr. Tappan.
And if you would, sir,
while I know it is your custom,
please, kindly refrain
from impersonating a lawyer,
which you patently are not.
As I was saying, Your Honor...
FORSYTH: Your Honor.
Mr. Secretary.
Your Honor, I am here on behalf of the President of the
United States, U.S. Secretary of State John Forsyth
representing the claims of Her Majesty,
Queen Isabella of Spain,
as concerns our mutual treaty
on the high seas of 1795.
JUTTSON: You have my attention, sir.
FORSYTH: Thank you.
These slaves, Your Honor,
are by rights the property of Spain,
and as such,
under Article 9 of said treaty
are to be returned posthaste.
Said treaty taking precedence
over all other claims and jurisdictions.
MEADE: Them slaves belong
to me and my mate, Your Majesty.
HOLABIRD: Your Honor,
I have not yet read the...
Who be you two gentlemen?
"We, Thomas R. Gedney
and Richard W. Meade,
"whilst commissioned
US Naval officers,
"stand before this court
as private citizens,
"and do hereby claim salvage
on the high seas
"of the Spanish ship <i>La Amistad</i>
and all her cargo."
- Here you go, sir.
- Your Honor...
You wish to make this claim
above that of the Queen of Spain?
Where was she, pray,
when we was fightin' the winds
to bring this vessel in, Your... Honor.
Her Majesty, the Queen of Spain,
was busy ruling a country.
Your Honor, these officers'
claims are just...
Your Honor!
Here are the true owners
of these slaves.
- (PRISONERS CLAMORING)
- (GAVEL BANGING)
- Order! Order in this court!
- ATTORNEY: On their behalf,
I am in possession of a receipt
for purchase executed in Havana, Cuba,
June 26, 1839,
I do hereby call upon this court
to immediately surrender
(UPROAR)
these goods
and that ship out there to my clients,
- Jose Ruiz...
<i>- Yo soy Ruiz.</i>
"Yoso" Ruiz, and... Pedro Montes?
Pedro Montes.
Ah, Mr. Tappan. How do you do, sir?
My name is Roger S. Baldwin,
attorney-at-law.
Real estate attorney?
Real estate, inventories
and other contestable assets, sir.
Can I help you with something?
Well, I don't know.
What is it that you do?
Well, I own various businesses
and banks.
Well, as a matter of fact,
you probably could help me,
Mr. Tappan. (CHUCKLES)
But that's not why I'm here.
You see, I'd like to help you.
- Me?
- Yes. I deal with property, Mr. Tappan.
And sometimes
I get people's property back for them,
and other times I get it taken away,
as in this case,
which is clearly a property issue.
You see, all of the claims here,
every single one of them,
speaks to the issue of ownership.
- Thank you very much, Mr. Baldwin.
- Baldwin, Roger S. Attorney-at-law.
But I'm afraid what's needed here
is a criminal attorney.
A trial lawyer.
But thanks for your interest.
Yes. Well,
intending no disrespect, Mr. Tappan,
but if that were the way to go,
well, then, quite frankly,
I wouldn't have bothered coming
down here, would I have?
(TAPPAN LAUGHS)
Goodbye. I bid you gentlemen
a good afternoon.
PICKNEY: In closing,
I call upon our distinguished
colleague from Massachusetts,
Representative John Quincy Adams,
to reweigh his unmeet
and unprecedented attempt
to convert this eccentric bequest of,
let's be frank,
a bunch of junk of one James Smithson,
into a so-called institute
of national treasure!
(MAN COUGHS)
Perhaps Mr. Adams
is meditating on his response.
(LAUGHTER)
Had I thought your remarks worthy of
any kind of riposte,
Representative Pickney,
be assured you'd have heard from me
hours ago.
Who?
Mr. Tappan. Lewis Tappan.
Yeah?
I must see him?
I'm required to see him?
No, of course not, sir.
He requests an audience.
Give me a hand.
Oh, he requests, does he?
Yeah. I don't know
anyone called Tappan.
Yes, sir, you do.
You've met him on countless occasions.
Where? Where is he?
He's right over there, sir.
Right there, sir. Oh.
- What is that?
- (COIN CLINKING)
- Where?
- Right there, sir.
Lewis! Good to see you again!
- And you, sir.
- (LAUGHS)
- This is Theodore Joadson.
- How do you do, sir?
- An honor to meet you, sir.
- Yeah.
- Sir? Is there somewhere we could...
- What? Let's stroll in the garden.
- This way, sir.
- What?
Let go of my arm. Over here.
TAPPAN: I believe this case
has great significance, sir.
Our Secretary of State has already
deemed it worthy of his attention.
ADAMS: You don't have to shout.
Stop shouting.
TAPPAN: No. Yes.
Well, he's supported
the Queen of Spain
in her claims
that the Africans belong to her.
And then there are others
making claims as well.
- Two sailors...
- ADAMS: What season is it?
- Pardon?
- I said, what season is it?
TAPPAN: I don't understand
what you mean.
ADAMS: There are two ways of knowing
for certain without consulting a calendar.
The leaves on the maple trees
have all gone and the fact that
the President is not at home over there
on Pennsylvania Avenue.
Tell me, sir, you really think
Van Buren cares about the whims
of an 11-year-old girl who wears a tiara?
'Cause I can assure you, sir,
having been over there,
only one thing occupies his thoughts
this time of the year,
being all things to all people,
which, of course,
means be nothing to no one.
In other words,
gettin' himself re-elected.
Give me a hand.
Huh?
- Will you help us, sir?
- Let go of my arm.
Take my stick.
- TAPPAN: Mr. Adams?
- Yeah, what?
TAPPAN: As an advocate for
the abolition of slavery, will you help us?
I'm neither friend nor foe
of the abolitionist cause.
No, I won't help you.
JOADSON: Sir.
What?
I know you, Mr. President.
I know you and your presidency
as well as any man
and your father's.
You were a child at his side
when he helped invent America.
And you, in turn, have devoted your life
to refining that noble invention.
There remains but one task undone,
one vital task
the founding fathers left to their sons
before their 13 colonies could
precisely be called United States.
And that task, sir, as you well know,
is crushing slavery.
Your record confirms
you're an abolitionist, sir,
even if you won't.
- And whether or not you admit it...
- Mr. Joadson.
...you belong with us.
(SNIFFS)
You're quite the scholar,
Mr. Joadson, aren't ya?
Quite the historian.
Let me tell you something
about that quality, if I might.
Without an accompanying mastery of
at least one-tenth its measure of grace,
such erudition is worthless, sir.
Now, you take it from one who knows.
If you gentlemen will excuse me.
(SNIFFS)
We know we aimed high
coming to see you, sir, but...
ADAMS: Well, aim lower!
Find yourselves someone
whose inspiration blossoms
the more you lose.
JOADSON: If the court
awards them to Spain,
they'll be taken to Cuba and executed.
If the two lieutenants prevail,
they'll most likely sell them to Spain
and they'll be executed.
If Montes and Ruiz
are successful in their campaign...
I'm a little confused by something.
What are they worth to you?
We're discussing the case,
not its expense.
BALDWIN: The case, of course.
Well, the case is much simpler
than you think, Mr. Tappan.
It's like anything, isn't it? Land,
livestock, heirlooms, what have you.
Livestock.
Yes. Consider,
the only way one may sell or purchase
slaves is if they are born slaves,
as on the plantation.
- I'm right, aren't I?
- Yes.
- So, are they?
- "Are they?"
Yes. Born slaves, as on a plantation.
No, we're not certain,
but we very much doubt it.
Well, let's say they are, and if they are,
then they are possessions,
and no more deserving of a criminal
trial than a bookcase or a plow.
Then we can all go home, can't we?
Now, on the other hand,
let's say they aren't slaves.
If they aren't slaves, then they were
illegally acquired, weren't they?
Forget mutiny, forget piracy,
forget murder and all the rest.
Those are subsequent,
irrelevant occurrences.
Ignore everything
but the pre-eminent issue at hand.
The wrongful transfer of stolen goods.
- Either way, we win.
- TAPPAN: Sir,
this war must be waged on
the battlefield of righteousness.
The what?
TAPPAN: It would be against everything
I stand for to let this deteriorate into
an exercise in
the vagaries of legal minutia.
Well, I don't know
what you're talking about, Mr. Tappan,
but I'm talking about
the heart of the matter.
As am I.
It is our destiny
as abolitionists and as Christians
to save these people.
These are people, Mr. Baldwin.
Not livestock.
Did Christ hire a lawyer
to get him off on technicalities?
He went to the cross, nobly.
You know why?
To make a statement.
To make a statement, as must we.
But Christ lost.
- You, I think...
- No, sir, he did not.
Or, at least you, Mr. Joadson,
want to win, don't you?
- Yes.
- I certainly do.
Hell, sometimes
I don't get paid unless I do.
Which brings us back to
the earlier question of worth.
Now, in order to do a better job than
the attorney who represented
the Son of God,
I'll require $2.50 a day.

I don't know.
He reminds me of that Fula of Baoma, you know the one--
...who hires himself out to scrape
elephant dung from the crop rows.
A dung-scraper might be just the
kind of man we need right now.
BALDWIN: Here, Africa,
is this where you're from?

He's an idiot. He just likes to hear himself speak.

HOLABIRD: Then,
in the quietude of the night,
after the Spaniards
attended their vespers,
and were deep in virtuous sleep,
the savages broke loose their collars
and stole onto the deck
like creatures of prey,
where they fell upon the unsuspecting
crew with these sabers and cane knives.
(GASPS FROM GALLERY)
I cannot overstate
the inhumanity of their acts...
Have you figured out who he is?
- ...the savagery, the bloodshed.
- (CINQUE SPEAKING)
An advisor of some kind. Maybe theirs.
HOLABIRD: Unsated by the mere deaths
of their victims,
they went on to mutilate
at least one of them...
What about him?
HOLABIRD: ...to dismember him.
The simple cook, a Creole.
Their own kind.
Theirs maybe.
HOLABIRD: But for the bravery
of <i>Señors</i> Ruiz and Montes,
who fought their way to the stern
and steered the <i>Amistad</i>
to these shores,
under constant threat of like fate,
we might never have
heard of this massacre,
this bloodbath.
But for their bravery,
these villains most certainly
would have escaped justice.
But they've not. They've not.
And Dung-Scraper?
I have a horrible feeling he talks for us.
(WHISPERING)
Do you know the difference
between a cow and a cabbage?
A brick and a bear?
Or how about
a polecat and a President?
Well, the Spanish government hopes
you don't have a whole lot more
common sense than that.
And I'll tell you why.
This case isn't about murder,
mayhem or massacres.
It's not about anything that dramatic.
This case is about knowing
the difference between here and there.
I want to show you something.

- ALL: Ah!
Thank you.
Your Honor, I speak more Spanish,
and I was born in Philadelphia.
Your Honor, on Spanish plantations,
slaves always choose to live
surrounded by their own ways
and simple languages.
Pray tell, what need they know
of Spanish? Fetch? Carry? Stop?
Ofttimes, gestures suffice for slaves, as,
indeed, for any other beast of burden.
Your Honor.
I represent the interests
of <i>Señors</i> Ruiz and Montes.
I remember.
I have a bill of sale issued in Havana
for the purchase of slaves.
I remember that, too.
On it, in addition to the amounts paid
for each, are their names.
Jose, Bernardo, Paco and so on.
On behalf of my clients,
I submit this document to the court.
JUTTSON: Mr. Baldwin, you've proffered
to this court this morning
a good deal of, I'll be kind,
circumstantial evidence.
Have you, in addition, anything, say,
in the order of actual documentation
that might refute this one,
and in so doing,
more compellingly support your claims?
I'm sure I could manufacture some
as easily as they have, Your Honor,
if that would suffice.
But what you're saying is,
then, you don't.
Is that correct?
I have them.
I'm afraid that does not impress me.
I thought you did quite well.
You do?
Much better than I expected,
to be honest.
Well, thank you, I think.
Although, I was concerned for a moment
that you might've forgotten
that this is just a case like any other.
Well, you needn't worry about that.
That's good.

(PANTING) Yes.
(GRUNTS)
BALDWIN: These papers,
and I shall ask you to examine them,
are portions of a ship's manifest
I retrieved from the <i>Amistad</i>
yesterday eve.
At first glance, perhaps,
they may appear to bolster
the prosecution's case.
You see, they list cargo,
cargo bearing the very Spanish names
that Messrs. Ruiz and Montes
insist represent my clients,
hand-scrawled in the margins.
But, no, this is not the manifest
of the <i>Amistad</i> at all. Look.
This is part of the cargo manifest
of a Portuguese vessel,
the notorious transatlantic
slave ship, the <i>Tecora.</i>
The <i>Tecora.</i>
(DISGRUNTLED MURMURING)
And I can bring you as many
witnesses as you wish, Mr. Holabird,
- to corroborate this.
<i>- Tecora.</i>
Their clients trade primarily
off the coast of West Africa,
the Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone.
I know what you're thinking.
Sierra Leone is a protectorate
of the British Crown.
Slavery is outlawed there.
Its principal port, in fact,
has been rechristened "Freetown."
How then,
can the Portuguese-flag-flying <i>Tecora</i>
engage in the slave trades
in these waters?
I'll tell you how, in a word.
Illegally.
Now, whatever these men say
from this point on clearly matters not
because this proves them liars.
My clients' journey
did not begin in Havana,
as they claim and keep claiming
more and more emphatically.
No, my clients' journey
began much, much further away.
I underestimated you, sir! (LAUGHS)
I really did!
Well, I should
take that as a compliment.
You should, indeed, sir.
You should, indeed.
You've done it, I think.
I can't imagine there's no not reaching
a favorable conclusion...
Hey! Hey!
Am I bleeding?
There's nothing there.
What did I do to deserve this?
You took the case, Mr. Baldwin.
You took the case, sir.
I should take that as a compliment.
ISABELLA: <i>"As you may perceive,</i>
"I wish you to act promptly
before this matter of the Africans
"becomes a weight

"Great countries."
"Our great countries.
"After all, the business

(SPEAKING SPANISH)
"Slavery is our pillar of commerce
in the New World.
"Without it, our goodwill

- "Should be imperiled."

<i>"but hold tightly to the power

<i>"That power, of course, is their wealth.</i>
<i>"The Africans must never go free.</i>
"With sincerest admiration,

I am not about to bend

Forget about them. They're unimportant.

not an ocean away.
I wish someone would
tell me what it means!
Leder, you yourself
said it was meaningless.
Well, not anymore.
(SIGHS)
John Calhoun paid me a visit.
Oh, God.
To explain to me why this case
is of much greater import,
much greater symbolism,
to use his word,
to the South and the North.
Now, if the Africans are executed,
the abolitionists will
certainly make good use of it.
And, yes, they will make some converts.
If, on the other hand, they are freed,
if that happens,
Calhoun assures me
the Southern states will
so ally themselves against you,
that you can forget about re-election.
(TUTS)
Over this?
It's worse than that.
Worse? What could be worse than that?
Calhoun believes, and I am not sure
I can entirely disagree with him,
that this could take us all
one long step closer to civil war.
This?
Yes, Mr. President.
But all is not lost.
Yes, the jury appears
disposed towards freeing them.
But juries can be dismissed.
They can?
But I believe we must go further
and remove the judge.
VAN BUREN: <i>We can do that?</i>
FORSYTH: <i>He could be prevailed upon</i>
<i>to recuse himself
for any number of reasons.</i>
<i>And with that in mind,</i>
<i>I've taken the liberty
of exploring possible replacements,</i>
<i>and I've found one
I strongly believe to be better.</i>
<i>He's young, which means he has
a career before him rather than behind,</i>
<i>which means he has yet
to feel the hankering</i>
<i>for magnanimous last gestures
for the sake of posterity.</i>
<i>And he is monumentally insecure,
particularly about his Catholic heritage.</i>
VAN BUREN: <i>He's Catholic?</i>
FORSYTH:
<i>His grandfather was Catholic,</i>
<i>which young Mr. Coglin
has striven all his days to keep quiet.</i>
MAN: Mr. President, meet Judge Coglin.
VAN BUREN: Judge Coglin,
we are so pleased to meet you.
Thank you so much for coming.
I've been reading in the papers
the continuing saga of the <i>Amistad.</i>
Real papers.
(CHUCKLES) Real papers. Yes, sir.
Yes. Bad luck,
this last unfolding chapter.
What to do now, eh?
Which is precisely why I came to
Massachusetts and imposed on you, sir.
No imposition, really.
(SIGHS) Yeah.
How did that, uh...
How did that young lawyer
take the news?
Oh, in stride, sir. In stride.
The thing is, sir, he did everything right.
- He proved the case.
- Did he?
Oh, yes, sir. Surprisingly, he did.
Good.
Well, he'll just have to do it again, then,
won't he?
But like most things, it should be
easier the second time around.
Well, I'm afraid it doesn't matter
what he does now, sir.
Rumor has it our next judge
was handpicked by Van Buren himself.
No!
Well, I'm embarrassed to admit
that I was under the misconception
that our executive
and judicial branches were separate.
No more so than these, Mr. Joadson.
No more so than these.
So now you know.
Yes.
- Sir?
- Yeah?
Mr. President, if it was you
handling the case...
ADAMS: But it isn't me.
And thank God for that.
(RINGS BELL)
But if it was, sir,
what would you do?
Well, when I was an attorney
a long time ago, young man,
I realized after much trial and error
that in a courtroom
whoever tells the best story wins.
In unlawyer-like fashion, I give you
that scrap of wisdom free of charge.
I'm much obliged for your time, sir.
What is their story, by the way?
Sir?
What is their story?
Why, they're, um...
They're from West Africa.
No. What is their story?
Mr. Joadson,
you're from where originally?
Why, Georgia, sir.
- Georgia.
- Yes, sir.
Does that pretty much
sum up what you are?
A Georgian? Is that your story?
No. You're an ex-slave
who's devoted his life
to the abolition of slavery,
and overcoming great obstacles
and hardships along the way,
I should imagine.
That's your story, isn't it?
(LAUGHS)
You and this young so-called lawyer
have proven you know what they are.
They're Africans. Congratulations.
What you don't know,
and, as far as I can tell,
haven't bothered in the least to discover
is who they are.
Right?
Seven.

I was rescued off a slave

I never went back.
A problem has arisen.

The judge we had, who believed,
I believe,
that you should be freed,
has been dismissed.
A new judge has been called upon
to hear the case,
this time without a jury.

How is that possible?
A chief cannot be replaced.
I can't explain it in any way
that you would understand, Cinque.
Or me, for that matter.
Only that, well, it has happened.

I am not a great orator

I'm not a big man in my profession.
I don't know that I alone can convince

I need your help.
When we go to court,
I need you to speak.

I cannot speak for the others.
Cinque, the others, they say you can.
They say you're the big man here.

What's this I hear about a lion?
(COVEY TRANSLATING)
They say you alone, alone, Cinque,
slew the most terrifying beast
anyone has ever seen.
Is it not true?
COVEY: It had killed several people.
Even hunters among us.
Everyone, including me, was afraid.
I was lying down with my family
when out of nowhere it appeared.
As it came for me,
I picked up this big rock and I threw it.
And by some miracle, you see, I hit it.
He don't know how that killed it,
but it did.
(CHUCKLES) A rock.
A rock.
(WHISPERING)
I received the gratitude
of everyone in the village.
I was given respect.
They treated me as if I was a prince.
They gave me the fine country cloth.
All these things they gave me,
I took them all.
But I knew I didn't deserve it.
For when I threw that rock at that beast
if I had missed him...
He said he wouldn't be
sitting here today
trying to explain these things
to you or me or...
He'd just be dead.
Understand?
You understand?
I'm not a big man, just a lucky one.
I might agree with you, Cinque,

The other lion.
The <i>Amistad,</i> Cinque. The insurrection.

Thank you, sir.
Mr. Holabird.
Quite a tale.
Intrigue, abduction,
courage in the face
of unspeakable suffering.
And all true. All right.
Now tell me if this is true.
Certain tribes in Africa,
for hundreds of years,
thousands, perhaps,
have owned slaves.
Translate.
(TRANSLATING)
Yes.
And under what circumstances
might one become a slave,
say, among the Mende,
of which you claim to belong?
Translate.
(TRANSLATING)
Wars, debts.
Oh, I see.
And how many men
are indebted to you?
- I don't think you do see.
- Excuse me?
- Your Honor, Mr. Holabird...
- It's different.
...is trying to intimidate my colleague.
The Mende word for "slave"
is closer in meaning to "worker."
Do these workers
own the land they work on?
Do they receive wages?
Are these workers free to
not work for you, if they so choose?
Your Honor,
he's questioning the translator.
No, the translator is answering
for the witness, Your Honor.
- The witness isn't being given a chance.
- Mr. Baldwin!
Fine, fine, Mr. Baldwin!
Slavery, indentured servitude.
Whatever they want to call it,
I don't mind.
The concept is the same.
Now, he is familiar with the concept.
After all, when you come down to it,
it's all about money, isn't it?
Slaves, production, money.
I mean, that's the idea of it.
Whether it's here or there. I'm confused.
Do your people
routinely slaughter their slaves
in the manner that you just
so vividly described to us?
Of course they don't.
What would be the point of that?
I mean, killing your own slaves is rather
like burning down your own house
or hut, isn't it?
How do you explain that paradox?
(TRANSLATING)
I don't understand what you mean.
Sure you do. As does everyone here.
The behavior you attribute
to your tormentors,
your victims, to be more precise,
and therefore every other
aspect of your testimony,
makes no sense.
- Not even to you.

But thank you for it.
Like all good works of fiction,
it was entertaining.
Nothing more.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE
ANGRILY)
BALDWIN: Captain Fitzgerald,
please explain to us
your primary duties
in Her Majesty's navy.
To patrol the Ivory Coast for slave ships.
Because?
Because slavery is banned
in British law, sir.
Yet the abduction of free men from
the British protectorate of Sierra Leone
and their illegal transportation
to the New World,
as described by Cinque,
is not unheard of, is it?
Not even unusual, regrettably.
Well, what, if anything, in his account
of his ordeal do you find believable?
His description of the slave fortress,
for one thing.
There is such a place.
You've seen it?
No, sir. We've not managed to locate it,
but there is overwhelming evidence
that it is real.
What evidence, exactly? Rumor?
Reports.
By "reports" you mean of the variety
Cinque shared with us today?
Its existence, sir, has been reported.
Cinque describes
the cold-blooded murder
of a significant portion of the people
on board the <i>Tecora.</i>
Mr. Holabird sees this as a paradox.
Do you, sir?
Often when slavers are intercepted,
or believe they may be,
they simply throw all
their prisoners overboard
and thereby rid themselves
of the evidence of their crime.
Drown hundreds of people?
Yes.
It hardly seems a lucrative business
to me, this slave-trading.
Going to all that trouble
rounding everybody up
only to throw them overboard.
No, it's very lucrative.
If only we could corroborate
Cinque's story somehow
with evidence of some kind.
FITZGERALD: The inventory.
This? From the <i>Tecora?</i>
If you look,
there's a notation made on May 10
correcting the number of slaves on
board, reducing their number by 50.
BALDWIN: What does that mean?
Well, if you look at it
in conjunction with Cinque's testimony,
I would say that it means this.
The <i>Tecora</i> crew,
having greatly underestimated
the amount of provisions
required for their journey,
solved the problem
by throwing 50 people overboard.
(INAUDIBLE)
I'm looking at the same
inventory, Captain,
and I'm sorry, I don't see where it says,
"This morning,
we threw 50 slaves overboard."
On May 10 or any other day.
As of course you would not.
I do see that the cargo weight changed.
They reduced the poundage, I see,
but that is all.
It's simple, ghastly arithmetic.
Well, for you, perhaps.
I may need a quill and parchment
and a better imagination.
And what poundage do you imagine
the entry may refer to, sir?
A mast and sails, perhaps?
CINQUE: Give us, us free.
Give us free.
Give us, us free.
Give us free.
Your Honor,
please instruct the defendant
that he cannot disrupt
these proceedings with such outbursts.
Give us, us free!
If we are to have any semblance
of order in this court, Your Honor...
- Give us, us free! Give us, us free!
- He cannot keep crying out...
Cannot keep crying out, "Give us free,"
- or anything else...
- Give us, us free!
...while I am trying
to question this witness!
Give us, us free!
Give us, us free!
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
You don't have to pretend to be interested in that.
Nobody's watching but me.
I'm not pretending.
I'm beginning to understand it.
Their people have suffered more than ours...
Their lives were full of suffering.
Then he was born and everything changed.
Who is he?
I don't know, but everywhere he goes,
he is followed by the sun.
Here he is healing people with his hands.
Protecting them...
Being given children...
Ah.
What's this?
He could also walk across the sea.
But then something happened...
He was captured. Accused of some crime.
Here he is with his hands tied.
He must have done something.
Why? What did we do?
Whatever it was, it was serious enough
to kill him for it.
Do you want to see how they killed him?
This is just a story, Yamba.
But look. That's not the end of it.
His people took his body down
from this... thing... this...
(PRAYING)
They took him into a cave.
They wrapped him in a cloth, like we do.
They thought he was dead, but he appeared
before his people again... and spoke to them.
Then, finally, he rose into the sky.
(PRAYING CONTINUES)
This is where the soul goes when you die here.
This is where we're going when they kill us.
It doesn't look so bad.
Buakei...
Buakei... Hold your head up.
BAILIFF: All rise.
After careful review
and thorough reflection,
I find it impossible to deny
the power of the government's position.
There is no doubt in my mind
that District Attorney Holabird,
Her Catholic Majesty, Isabella of Spain,
and her trusted minister,
<i>Señor</i> Calderon,
have all proceeded with the utmost faith
in the soundness of their case.
I also believe
that <i>Señors</i> Ruiz and Montes
may have misrepresented
the origin of the prisoners.
An issue which weighs crucially
upon their fate,
and that of the Spaniards as well.
Were they born in Africa?
But since the answer
to that fundamental question
shall so heavily govern every
determination of this court,
I ask it again.
Were they born in Africa?
I believe they were.
(MURMURING)
As such, Her Catholic Majesty's
claims of ownership have no merit.
Neither, of course, do those for salvage
made by Lieutenants Meade
and Gedney.
MAN: This is outrageous!
I hereby order the immediate arrest and
detention of <i>Señors</i> Ruiz and Montes
- (PEOPLE CHEERING)
- (SHOUTS IN SPANISH)
by federal marshals
on the charge of slave-trading!
Yes!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
The release of the Africans
and their conveyance,

at her earliest convenience
and expense,
back to their homes in Africa!
Yes!
We've done it, Joadson!
We've done it! Yes!
- Covey, tell them! Tell them now!
- I think they know.
(SOBBING AND CHANTING)
(ALL CHANT)
Look at 'em.
What's most bewildering to Her Majesty
is this arrogant independence
of the American courts.
After all, if you cannot rule the courts,
you cannot rule.
<i>Señor</i> Calderon,
as any true American will tell you,
it's the independence of our courts
that keeps us free.
John, glad you're here.
- Mr. Forsyth.
- The President...
Mr. President? Senator Calhoun is here.
John! (CHUCKLES)
I was afraid you weren't
going to be able to join us.
You may put that fear to rest,
Mr. President.
Thank you. Please.
I'd like you to meet <i>Señor</i> Calderon,
ambassador from Spain.
(CALHOUN GREETING IN SPANISH)
I thought you said he wasn't coming.
He said he wasn't.
You see, <i>Señor</i> Calderon,
there's a growing number of people
in this part of the country
that regard us in the South
as not only geographically
beneath them.
(EXHALES) They ignore the fact
that slavery is so interwoven
into the fabric of this society,
that to destroy it would be
to destroy us as a people.
It's immoral. That's all they know.
Therefore, so are we.
Immoral and inferior.
We are inferior in one area.
We're not as proficient in the art of gain.
We're not as wealthy
as our northern neighbors.
We're still struggling.
Take away our life's blood now...
Well, we all know what happens then,
North and South.
They become the masters,
and we the slaves.
But not without a fight.
Senator Calhoun is being modest.
He's not inferior in another area.
The art of exaggeration.
(LAUGHTER)
Ask yourself, <i>Señor</i> Calderon,
what court wants to be responsible for
the spark that ignites the firestorm?
What President wants to be in office
when it comes crashing
down around him?
Certainly no court before this one.
Certainly no President before this one.
So,
judge us not too harshly, sir,
and bid Her Majesty like,
because the real determination our
courts and our President must make
is not whether
this ragtag group of Africans
raised swords against their enemy,
but rather, must we?
Whoa!
BALDWIN: Come along, Mr. Joadson.
This news...
Well, of course, it's bad news,
but the truth is
they may be more valuable
to our struggle in death than in life.
Martyrdom, Mr. Joadson.
From the dawn of Christianity, we have
seen no stronger power for change.
Well, you know it's true.
What is true, Mr. Tappan,
and believe me when I tell you
I've seen this,
is that there are some men
whose hatred of slavery
is stronger than anything
except for the slave himself.
If you wish to inspire such hatred
in a man, Mr. Joadson,
speak to him in that fashion
and it may come true.
(SLAMS DOOR)

there would be a judgment,
and if we won the judgment
we would go free!
No, no. What I said is that

What I said, that if we won it
at the state level, we then go on.
That's what you said!

I said it, but I shouldn't have.
What I should've said...
- I can't translate that.
- You can't translate what?
I can't translate "should."

there's no word in Mende for "should"?
No. Either you do something,
or you don't do it.

What?
That since they took over the ship
far out to sea,

nor America owns the sea,
how is it that the treaty applies?
Tell him the treaty recognizes
no jurisdictional limitations.
- Well?
- He will ask me why.
Because I said so.
Excuse me, sir.
Yes?
Cinque would like to know
that if he is the legal property
of Ruiz and Montes,
then how does the treaty apply,

Or their citizens.
"Or their citizens" is included

Although, I'll admit that
perhaps more so to us than you.
All right, don't... Yeah. (COUGHS)
Cinque.
Do you know who I am?
Has anyone told you about me?
(TRANSLATES)
Yes.
- What have they told you?
- (TRANSLATES)
COVEY: That you are a chief.
I was a chief, yes.
A chief cannot become anything
less than a chief, even in death.
Oh, how I wish such were true here,
Cinque.
You've no idea.
One tries to govern wisely,
strongly, but...
One tries to govern in a way that
betters the lives of one's villagers.
One tries to kill the lion.
Unfortunately, one isn't always
wise enough or strong enough.
Time passes
and the moment is gone.
Now, listen, Cinque. Listen.
We're about to bring your case
before the highest court in our land.
We're about to do battle with a lion
that is threatening
to rip our country in two.
Huh?
And all we have on our side is a rock.
Of course, you didn't ask
to be at the center
of this historic conflagration
any more than I did,
but we find ourselves here nonetheless
by some mysterious mix
of circumstances
and all the world watching.
So, what are we to do? Huh?
(CINQUE SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Is he going to help? He has far
many more questions than answers.
- What'd he just say?
- Sorry. I didn't catch it.
Cinque, look. I'm being honest with you.
Anything less would be disrespectful.
I'm telling you, I'm preparing you,
I suppose I'm explaining to you
that the test ahead of us is
an exceptionally difficult one.
We won't be going in there alone.
Alone? Indeed not. No.
We have right at our side.
We have righteousness at our side.
We have Mr. Baldwin over there.
COVEY: I meant my ancestors.
I will call into the past,
far back to the beginning of time,
and beg them to come and help me
at the judgment.
I will reach back and draw them into me.
And they must come,
for at this moment, I am the
whole reason they have existed at all.
Thank you.
Your Honors,
(CLEARS THROAT)
I derive much consolation
from the fact that my colleague,
Mr. Baldwin here,
has argued the case
in so able and so complete a manner
as to leave me scarcely anything to say.
However,
why are we here?
How is it that a simple,
plain property issue
should now find itself so ennobled
as to be argued before
the Supreme Court of
the United States of America?
I mean, do we fear the lower courts,
which found for us easily,
somehow missed the truth? Is that it?
Or is it, rather, our great
and consuming fear of civil war
that has allowed us to heap symbolism
upon a simple case
that never asked for it?
And now would have us disregard truth
even as it stands before us,
tall and proud as a mountain.
The truth,
in truth, has been driven
from this case like a slave,
flogged from court to court,
wretched and destitute.
(CHUCKLING) And not
by any great legal acumen
on the part of the opposition,
I might add.
But through the long,
powerful arm of the executive office.
Yea, this is no mere property case.
Gentlemen, I put it to you thus.
This is the most important case
ever to come before this court.
Because what it in fact concerns
is the very nature of man.
These are, um...
These are transcriptions of letters
written between our
Secretary of State, John Forsyth,
and the Queen of Spain, Isabella II.
Now, I ask that you
accept their perusal
as part of your deliberations.
Thank you, sir.
I would not touch on them now
except to notice
a curious phrase
which is much repeated.
The Queen again and again
refers to our "incompetent courts."
Now what, I wonder,
would be more to her liking? Eh?
A court that finds against the Africans?
Well, I think not.
And here is the fine point of it.
What Her Majesty wants is a court
that behaves just like her courts,
the courts
this 11-year-old child plays with
in her magical kingdom called Spain.
A court that will do what it is told.
A court that can be toyed with
like a doll.
(CHUCKLES) A court, as it happens,
of which our own President,
Martin Van Buren, would be most proud.
Thank you.
This is a publication
of the office of the President.
It's called <i>The Executive Review,</i>
and I'm sure you all read it.
At least I'm sure
the President hopes you all read it.
This is a recent issue,
and there's an article in here
written by
"a keen mind of the South," who...
My former Vice President,
John Calhoun, perhaps.
Could it be?
Who asserts that "there has never
existed a civilized society
"in which one segment did not
thrive upon the labor of another.
"As far back as one chooses to look,
"to ancient times, to biblical times,
"history bears this out.
"In Eden, where only two were created,
"even there, one was pronounced
subordinate to the other.
"Slavery has always been with us
and is neither sinful nor immoral.
"Rather, as war and antagonism
are the natural states of man,
"so, too, slavery,
as natural as it is inevitable."
Well, gentlemen, I must say I differ
with the keen minds of the South
and with our President,
who apparently shares their views,
offering that the natural state
of mankind is instead,
and I know this is a controversial idea,
is freedom.
Is freedom.
And the proof is the length
to which a man,
woman or child will go
to regain it, once taken.
He will break loose his chains.
He will decimate his enemies.
He will try and try and try,
against all odds, against all prejudices,
to get home.
Cinque, would you stand up,
if you would,
so everyone can see you.
This man is black. We can all see that.
But can we also see as easily
that which is equally true?
That he is the only
true hero in this room.
Now, if he were white, he wouldn't be
standing before this court,
fighting for his life.
If he were white
and his enslavers were British,
he wouldn't be able to stand,
so heavy the weight of
the medals and honors
we would bestow upon him.
Songs would be written about him.
The great authors of our times
would fill books about him.
His story would be told
and retold in our classrooms.
Our children,
because we would make sure of it,
would know his name
as well as they know Patrick Henry's.
Yet, if the South is right,
what are we to do with that
embarrassing, annoying document,
the Declaration of Independence?
What of its conceits?
"All men created equal,"
"inalienable rights,"
"life, liberty," and so on and so forth?
What on Earth are we to do with this?
I have a modest suggestion.
The other night I was talking
with my friend Cinque.
He was over at my place, and we were
out in the greenhouse together.
And he was explaining to me
how when a member of the Mende,
that's his people...
How when a member of the Mende
encounters a situation
where there appears no hope at all,
he invokes his ancestors.
Tradition.
See, the Mende believe that if one can
summon the spirit of one's ancestors,
then they have never left,
and the wisdom and strength
they fathered and inspired
will come to his aid.
James Madison, Alexander Hamilton,
Benjamin Franklin,
Thomas Jefferson,
George Washington,
John Adams.
We have long resisted
asking you for guidance.
Perhaps we have feared in doing so,
we might acknowledge
that our individuality,
which we so, so revere,
is not entirely our own.
Perhaps we've feared
an appeal to you
might be taken for weakness.
But we've come to understand, finally,
that this is not so.
We understand now,
we've been made to understand
and to embrace the understanding
that who we are is who we were.
We desperately need
your strength and wisdom
to triumph over our fears,
our prejudices, ourselves.
Give us the courage to do what is right.
And if it means civil war,
then let it come.
And when it does,
may it be, finally,
the last battle
of the American Revolution.
That's all I have to say.
JUSTICE: In the case of
<i>The United States of America</i>
<i>v. The Amistad Africans,</i>
it is the opinion of this court
that our treaty of 1795 with Spain,
on which the prosecution has
primarily based its arguments,
is inapplicable.
While it is clearly stipulated in Article 9
that, and I quote,
seized ships and cargo
are to be returned entirely
to their proprietary,
the end of quote,
it has not been shown
to the court's satisfaction
that these particular Africans
fit that description.
We are then left with the alternative,
that they are not slaves
and therefore cannot
be considered merchandise
but are, rather, free individuals
with certain legal and moral rights,
including the right
to engage in insurrection
against those who would
deny them their freedom.
And therefore, over one dissent,
it is the court's judgment
that the defendants are to be
released from custody at once
and, if they so choose,
to be returned to their homes in Africa.
Good job.
Thank you.
Well...

FITZGERALD: <i>Take a letter, Ensign.</i>
To His Honor, the United States
Secretary of State, Mr. John Forsyth.
"My dear Mr. Forsyth,
"it is my great pleasure to inform you
that you are, in fact, correct.
"The slave fortress in Sierra Leone
does not exist."
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Queen Isabella of Spain continued to argue the
Amistad matter with seven more American Presidents.
In 1864, her hopes of "compensation" finally collapsed
with the Confederate Army's defeat at Atlanta.
Cinque returned to Sierra Leone
to find his own people engaged in civil war.
His village was destroyed and his family gone.
It is believed they were sold into slavery.
