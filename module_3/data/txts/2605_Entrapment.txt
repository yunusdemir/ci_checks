Hello?
Ming!
Turn that stinking music down!
Oh, it's you.
Where's my painting? I want my painting.
In the mail?
Well, that's original.
I have to say,
I'm astonished that you could do it.
The climb!
All that schlepping at your tender age.
Anyway, bad news.
The price for the goggles went up.
The Rembrandt's
not gonna cover my expenses.
Under the circumstances,
40 million would be a bargain.
I don't care how you get it.
Just make sure that you get it fast.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
- Morning, Mr Cruz.
- Morning.
First you insure the art, only to watch it
get clipped a month after the client buys it.
Well, it could become part
of our ad campaign.
I'll remember that when I go upstairs to hear
about my new position in the Toledo office.
I called you at 4.30 this morning.
- I was home in bed.
- You didn't pick up.
- I didn't wanna pick up.
- You had company.
- He came in the window.
- How romantic.
I think that's how he got in.
This was 70 storeys up with smart-glass
windows at 400 pounds a pop.
He rigged something.
And I think it was...
- .. telescoping bolts.
- And you know this how?
Excuse me.
- You're showing off again.
- "Let a thousand flowers bloom. "
- Chairman Mao.
- You got it.
He left the window open when he came in.
The draught blew over the flowers.
Scope the bolts on that window,
I'll bet you'll find fresh scratches on them.
- Who do you like for this?
- Guess.
Oh, gee, I wonder.
Indulge me.
Indulge you?
- Bob, may I?
- Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.
Four weeks ago, when our client
bought the Rembrandt.
- See anyone we know?
- No.
No, and neither did anyone else.
Now, look again.
You think he marked the buyer
at the auction house.
- Right.
- Good work, Bob.
And let's not forget the calling card.
Elvis has not left the building.
- This is classic Mac, Hector.
- In the five years that I've known you,
you've liked MacDougal for over
half the cases that we've worked.
- He's the best.
- He's also 60 years old.
He ain't Spiderman any more. He's a wealthy
guy who doesn't have to steal a Rembrandt.
You think this guy steals
because he has to?
Keep working.
So you get in here at 7am,
you work until 10,
you have lunch in the park by yourself,
you don't have any friends at the office...
- Wow, you've been paying attention.
- I'm worried about you.
Maybe I like being alone.
Maybe I'm getting over someone.
Well, they say nothing gets you over
the last one like the next one.
Is this your way
of asking me out, Hector? Huh?
Well, um... not if you're gonna say no.
You may be right.
- He was here this week.
- He flew back to London this morning?
It might be worth our while to send
someone over there, see what he's up to.
- I know this guy.
- Do you?
- Sure.
- Some years back,
when I was still at the Bureau,
we sent a couple of guys after him.
I know, I know.
They disappeared. I know the story.
- And these were both good agents.
- They were both men.
What do you have in mind for bait?
- The one thing I know he wants.
- Why not the Mona Lisa?
Our guy likes a challenge.
Come on.
I want this back.
Thank you, sir.
God.
Shit.
Rule number one: Never carry a gun,
or you might be tempted to use it.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm gonna ask you some questions.
If I don't like your answers,
you're going out the window.
- Why are you following me?
- I've got a proposition for you.
- How do I know that you're not a cop?
- You're just gonna have to trust me.
Rule number two:
Never trust a naked woman.
I had nothing to sleep in.
Somebody stole my luggage.
Really? I'm shocked. It's amazing
what's gettin' stolen these days.
- Your bags...
- That Rembrandt.
Mm... Indeed.
That Rembrandt.
- And this is your proposition?
- Yep.
- I don't think it's for sale.
- It's not. I'm gonna steal it.
From Bedford Palace?
It's rather well guarded.
By, among other things,
its own random-access security code,
changed daily,
to which I have the key.
- Well, good for you.
- But I need your help. I can't get in and out.
I've already got a buyer
who's gonna give me 40 million for it.
I have absolutely no reason
to believe a word you've told me.
- But you want to.
- Why is that?
Because you want the mask.
Mm... First we try, then we trust.
- Meaning what?
- Meaning, meet me outside the hotel, 9am.
- Preferably dressed.
- How do I know you'll be there?
If I tell you I'll be there, I'll be there.
And I'm never late.
- Not ever?
- Never.
If I'm late...
it's because I'm dead.
Whose hotel?
Yours or mine?
Mac?
Mac?
Ah, here we are.
You go straight in there and ask for Haas.
- Haas?
- Lovely fella. Very low-key.
You tell him you want to buy a Qing vase.
The price is £200,000,
which, of course, you're not about to pay.
- Why not?
- Because you're going to steal it.
You are a thief, aren't you?
Take this card, which is fake.
As he goes to the back to swipe it,
you swipe the vase.
OK.
Enjoy.
I'll be waiting.
- Ooh!
- Sorry.
Hello.
Hi.
- I'm here for the Qing vase.
- I don't know you.
That's because we've never met before.
Mac sent me.
- Where's the money?
- Where's the vase?
- OK, show me the real one.
- No, trust me, babe.
This is better than a real one. 200,000.
- What's that?
- It's a credit card.
- Yeah, and?
- I need the miles.
What exactly... do you think this is?
- Harrods?
- No, I've never seen rats at Harrods.
You like a joke, don't you?
- Sure.
- How funny is this?
I'm sorry. I think I made
a terrible mistake about the vase.
Too right.
Uh, yeah, I did.
Time's running out.
You can still escape if you're quick.
Now listen...
- Where's the vase?
- I broke it.
- What!
- I'm sorry.
Oh, God.
God bless.
He came at me with a knife.
What was I supposed to do?
You were supposed to get the damn vase.
It was a cheap Victorian knockoff.
You wouldn't have wanted it anyway.
You missed the point of the entire exercise.
No, I didn't.
Oh, good.
Good girl.
- Give it to me.
- What is it?
Give it to me!
- What is it?
- Bedford Palace.
The complete plans,
security system, soup to nuts.
Man, look what you've done
to this beautiful car.
Yeah, thank God it's not mine.
- Here, some clothes.
- Where are we going?
- These are my clothes.
- Yes, you have some nice things.
- It was you? You stole my luggage?
- I'm a thief. So sue me.
- And where are we going?
- Up.
Mac, where is my suitcase?
- It's with hotel security.
- With what?
But why?
Well, there was a robbery
yesterday at Cryptonic.
And someone stole five prototype
superchips worth $4 million each.
And one of these chips
is inside your suitcase.
- With hotel security.
- Yes.
And one anonymous phone call,
from me, plus the photos...
- What photos?
- Oh, yes.
These.
Who took...?
Hey!
- This is entrapment.
- What?
- I said, this is called entrapment.
- No. Actually, it's called blackmail.
Entrapment... is what cops do to thieves.
You coming?
Almost there.
No lock? No security?
You're not casing the joint
already, are you? This way.
Oh, wow.
Shall we?
Oh, my God.
- This is quite a collection.
- Thank you.
Only contemporary art?
- You sound surprised.
- No, it's just not what I expected.
I mean, where are the suits of armour
and crossed swords?
Up in the attic. Whiskey?
Sure. I'd love one.
Wow.
- Is all this paid for?
- With blood.
- Cheers.
- To the mask.
- I'll show you to your room.
- Who else do you bring here?
No-one.
- That's sad.
- Why?
Well, to have something like this
and not share it with anyone.
I don't need to share it with anyone.
Most people buy art just to show it off.
I collect art for me.
Your room's this way.
Good night, then.
- But it's still early.
- Yes, we have an early start.
- But I'm not tired.
- Hm.
Where do you sleep?
Why?
Just in case I need anything.
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.
Has there ever been anyone you couldn't
manipulate, beguile, or seduce?
No.
Why, do I make you uneasy, Mac?
No. No, not at all.
In fact, I think now might be a good time
for you and I to, uh... discuss something.
- What do you have in mind?
- Uh...
- The rules.
- Oh... OK.
In order for there to be
complete trust between thieves,
there can be nothing personal.
A job is a job.
You do your part, I do mine.
If one of us is thinking about something
other than the task at hand...
we'll either both get caught,
or both get dead.
Good night again.
No. No. No.
No. No.
No.
- That's the way in.
- That's the lake.
Yes, I know it's the lake, dear.
The first duke dug a tunnel
as a back door for his mistress.
A hundred years later,
they flooded the place.
OK, so we go underwater.
I go underwater. I steal the mask.
You get a finder's fee of 10%.
But I have the code to the mask case, dear.
Which you're now going to give to me.
No!
- Have you been wasting my time?
- Have you been wasting mine?
I'll arrange your return to London.
- I'm not who you think I am, Mac.
- I hope not, for your sake.
I'm a thief.
So you keep telling me.
I stole the Rembrandt.
- Mac, I stole the Rembrandt.
- And I painted the Sistine Chapel.
- Come on, ask me how I did it.
- So how did you do it?
I came in from the roof. I dropped
20 floors down on a McNeal Descender.
- You must be a hell of a climber.
- I am.
Mm?
I am a hell of a climber.
I am... one... hell of a climber.
But how did you get it out of there?
Now that...
is the most... beautiful part.
- I mailed it.
- No!
I put it down their own mail chute.
Simple...
effective... safe.
- That's very clever.
- Nope.
Not clever.
- It was perfect.
- Absolutely unbelievable.
You're right.
It is beautiful. Mm?
Did you know that Rembrandt lived
with his parents well into his forties?
But of course you'd know that.
You're perfect.
- How did you get that?
- Why rob the penthouse...
when the mailroom's on the ground floor?
How did you know I took it?
Well, there's only a handful of people
who can make the equipment you used.
And I know all of them.
- Someone was expecting that.
- Obviously.
- Mr Conrad Greene of Kuala Lumpur.
- Oh, God.
What was it? A down payment?
A service this Mr Greene is providing?
Yeah, something like that.
What could you possibly
want to steal in Malaysia? Hm?
A hundred million dollars.
- What's the job?
- Like the wise man said...
"First we try, then we trust. "
Ah, good morning.
Wanna tell me why my Jaguar looks
like you drove it off a fuckin' cliff?
Thibadeaux, I'm awfully sorry.
You owe me 140 G's.
How about a $40 million
Chinese mask instead?
Is it turbocharged with a six-CD changer?
- Did you get everything I need?
- We done with this, you buyin' me a new car.
Agreed.
- Did you get the small pneumatics?
- Yeah, I got the small pneumatics.
You gotta be a damn elf
to use one of them things.
- And the det cord?
- It's in the van.
That's some nasty shit. You don't
wanna be mixing it with nothing else
unless you wanna be
all over the floor bumpin' into yourself.
- What the hell's this?
- IR thermo-camera, what you asked for.
- I specifically said no liquid-plasma screen.
- That was specifically all I could get.
How I am supposed to do this
without the right tools?
Gimme a break, man.
What do you think this is?
You give me a list,
I go to K-Mart and get this shit?
Figure out something.
You always do.
- Where's the honey?
- In the loch, training.
I told her I swim for an hour every day,
so she'll do it for two.
So, when is it we do the dirty?
Maybe we should wait a bit.
- She's got a bigger job after this one.
- This is big enough, Mac.
It's never big enough.
- You are keepin' this strictly business, right?
- Strictly.
Have you ever bought a woman's dress?
It's for the job. For her.
I don't know her size.
Well, by the looks of her,
I'd say she's probably a six,
but she'd look real fine
if you put her in a four.
I used to have this girl named Tina.
She used to say the dress made the woman.
I say, "Oh no, baby.
It's the woman makes the dress. "
That's a lovely story.
- But could you get the dress?
- Mac, you're too old for this shit.
- This mask thing better be worth it.
- Oh, it is.
I'm saying,
it better be worth it for me.
Our gear has arrived.
Who brought it?
Delivery man.
What, you just order
that kind of stuff from a catalogue?
No, I just order it
from someone I trust implicitly.
There's lots more, if you're not too tired.
Left a bit. Left a bit.
- What is it?
- It's 15.
Good. Now...
Straight back. Straight back.
Go on, take it out. Back.
There you go. There.
Yeah, straight back now.
Keep it taut. Taut!
There. That's it.
Ah, Finally.
Good. Well done.
Three, two, one...
- Five decibels.
- Still too loud.
Set?
- One and...
- Bang.
- Two and...
- Bang.
- Three and...
- Bang.
Four and...
Oh, yeah. Bang.
The bangs must come
with the chimes of the clock.
- I forgot. I forgot.
- All right, again.
Knees together.
Down, down, tuck.
I'll watch the mask. You keep your
mind on your movement. Reach.
No, no, no.
These are lasers. Hm?
I am your eyes. So you keep yours
closed, because you can't see. Mm?
But I'll be watching
every move on our screen.
Come on, move it. You've got
three minutes till the guard gets here.
Up... Good.
Better. Left leg. Left.
There you go...
- I need a break.
- You'll get a break when you get it right.
Number one.
- Two and...
- Bang.
- Three and...
- Bang.
- Four and...
- Bang.
Five and... inflate!
Well, what's this?
It's supposed to be one second.
- You're supposed to open the valve full.
- I did open it full. Look, it's open.
All right, very well.
I'll rectify it later. Hm?
Six... Lever.
Seven. Drop.
- Eight?
- Deflate.
Well done.
I did open it full, OK?
You can go over there and check.
Come on.
Here...
This is where I'm gonna
enter into them. You see?
And then I'm gonna come up through
the first beam. This is the hardest part.
I'm just gonna...
You see? Right here.
Once I get under the first beam, I'll be fine.
So just don't worry about me, OK?
Once I have this on the computer,
I can visualise it.
- I can do this blindfolded now.
- Really?
- Is this absolutely necessary?
- Yes.
- Because you won't be able to see them...
- And you will. Right.
Trust me.
- We're ready.
- I'll tell you when we're ready.
You forgot the damn
pressure switch, didn't you?
Jesus. You just can't help it, can you?
- Help what?
- Being such a nasty son of a bitch.
This is how it has to be.
- But if you can't deal with it...
- Hey, Mac? Bullshit!
You know what?
I think you're just afraid to be nice to me.
Bastard.
Merry Christmas.
- For me?
- Well, it's certainly not for me. Open it.
I thought you were probably a six,
but would look very nice as a four.
It's beautiful.
But?
Believe it or not,
no-one's ever bought me a dress before.
Well, it comes out of your share.
I didn't get you anything.
- Not necessary.
- No, no. I want to.
- I won't be long.
- I'll be waiting.
Waverly Insurance.
Hi, this is Virginia Baker.
Hector Cruz on a secure line, please.
Was it my imagination, or didn't I say
something about checking in every day?
I'm sorry, Hector, but I can't exactly
just pick up my cell phone here.
- I've been worried about you. Where are you?
- I'm staying with Mac, at his castle.
Well, spare me the details.
Did he take the bait?
Oh, yeah. Big time.
And he's got the Rembrandt.
Well... Tilt bingo jackpot.
- You wanna pick him up now?
- We've got him for possession, conspiracy...
But I can catch him with his hand in the till.
That's grand larceny, 25 years to life.
- You think you're still up to that?
- Hector, I know so.
- So give me the how and the when.
- Look, I'll call you as soon as I know, OK?
- Is that a promise?
- Of course, it's a promise.
- Look, I gotta go.
- OK, just wait a second. I wanted to...
Hello?
Mac!
Mac?
Mac.
Mac?
Mac?
Ohh!
- Did you find what you were looking for?
- Ohh!
- God, you scared me.
- You know what they say about fear.
- The only remedy's to cut off the head.
- Really?
Beautiful view, isn't it?
It helps me to see things more clearly.
You know, I never come up here
without dropping something off.
Go ahead, then.
We leave in two hours.
Gin!
Well?
Well...
You're the most beautiful crook
I've ever seen.
Why, thank you, kind sir.
So I'll recognise you.
I wouldn't wanna go home with the
wrong man by mistake, now would I?
It is a masked ball.
We all go as someone else.
Ten-thirty in three, two, one...
Now.
I think we should pay our respects
to the guest of honour. Shall we?
One, two, three, four, five and...
North.
One, two, three...
Dum-de-dum, dum-de-dum.
Oh, here we are.
Oh!
- 15 seconds.
- Going hot.
Seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.
And one...
And two...
And three...
And four...
And five...
Six...
And seven...
And eight...
- More air.
- Nine...
- More.
- Ten...
More!
- Eleven... It's too loud.
- More.
OK.
Up.
Mm.
Good.
You've got
three minutes on the guard.
Balance. One point.
Now lift.
Two minutes on the guard.
Lift.
Extend. Now turn.
Up a little more.
Now bend the knee.
75 seconds.
Freeze.
You're blocking the beam.
I can't see it.
Got it covered.
Clever girl.
Now, remember the damn pressure switch.
Ah.
Good girl.
35 seconds.
Preparing pressure switch
neutralisation device.
Now get out of there - fast.
Unbelievable.
- Let me have the mask.
- Here he is.
Now this is where we play Truth or Dare.
What?
First we start with truth, huh?
You work for Hector Cruz
at Waverly Insurance, hm?
Now...
- I dare you to lie to me.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
What?
The job was a cover.
- That's how I got the code.
- No, no, no. You're playing both sides.
You're gonna sell the mask
to Conrad Greene, and then turn me in.
- No, no. I need you for the job.
- There is no other job.
There is.
It's worth over...
- And don't tell me it's worth 100 million.
- It's not. It's... You're right, it's not.
It's worth over a billion.
And that's just your share.
I'm not lying.
I can't do this job without you, Mac.
Please come with me to Kuala Lumpur.
Can you just decide soon, please?
Four, three, two, one.
Your time's up. You said you'd tell
me what the next job is in 24 hours.
It's a bank.
And?
And I didn't say I'd tell you any more.
Isn't it beautiful here?
Banks have never really been my thing.
Think a billion dollars and change your mind.
- I just don't like surprises.
- Trust me, there won't be any.
Trust me.
There always are surprises.
I must say, it's, uh... very homey.
Why, thank you.
Of course, when I said bank...
I didn't mean just any bank.
- A room with a view.
- I give you the world's tallest building...
- And we're gonna steal it?
- .. home of the International Clearance Bank,
which, I'm sure you already know,
controls virtually all big money
transactions in Southeast Asia.
- Do I have your attention now?
- Undivided.
Here, the headquarters of the International
Clearance Bank in New York.
Running from there are hackproof,
firewalled, dedicated lines
to computers in its branch offices
around the world.
The only access is from
central control in New York
or from the totally secure computers
in the local branch offices.
In Kuala Lumpur,
only one man has unlimited access.
Lee Kuan Hong, Chairman of the International
Clearance Bank of Kuala Lumpur.
The vaults are accessed by two things:
a key code and a completely
unfakeable retinal scan...
Morning, everyone.
Nice day, uh?
Hi.
Arghhh!
.. which we're gonna fake.
Right now, our Chairman, with a face
full of Mace, is getting his eyes checked,
with a little help from
Conrad Greene's guys, hopefully.
- With me so far?
- All the way.
Good.
Now, because of the millennium bug,
our nervous friends at International Clearance
are gonna run a series of integrity tests,
which they're rehearsing even as we speak.
Prepare test shutdown for Sydney in...
Just before midnight, local time,
they're gonna shut down the mainframe
in each zone for 30 seconds.
- Sydney is shut down.
- Run test program.
We need those 30 seconds
to patch into the mainframe.
We then need ten seconds of one-on-one time
with the computer to download "the stuff".
- How do we acquire those ten seconds?
- We steal 'em.
The transmitter I left behind simply
overrides the signal of the atomic clock.
So, from 11 pm tomorrow night,
their clocks gain a fraction
of a second every minute,
and we gain our ten seconds.
And what is this "stuff" we are downloading?
Enya?
Cunningly disguised in there is a disk
that took me five years to make,
cooped up in my broom closet
at Waverly Insurance.
It tells the ICB computer to transfer
relatively small amounts of money
from hundreds of corporations
all over Southeast Asia into my account.
- Our account.
- Yeah, our account.
Eight billion dollars in total.
You said one billion.
Mm-mm.
I said that was your share.
What can you do with seven billion
that you can't do with four?
Hold the record.
Alone.
- Sounds rather lonely.
- Alone?
No. Alone is good.
- You want a beer?
- Thank you.
We'll need three weeks to prepare.
- What?
- Minimum.
- No. It has to be tomorrow night.
- No way.
You don't understand. It has to be
millennium midnight, or it's never.
Then it's never.
It's impossible.
You...
OK. Fifty-fifty.
What?
You heard.
It's impossible.
But doable.
So, ladies and gentlemen, we are
now standing over 700ft above sea level.
Our skybridge is the longest
and highest in the world.
It stretches over 300ft to the opposite tower.
It is supported, as you can see,
by four flexible steel pillars.
The lights are being hung
for our millennium party tomorrow.
Over 40,000 light bulbs
will make this truly a sight to remember.
So, what have we here?
We have the goggles
with the chairman's retinal scan,
and we have the chairman's
access card to the 86th floor...
- .. in the bag.
- Is there anything else I need to know?
Confucius, he say:
"Don't use cannon to kill mosquito. "
- Right.
- Well...
now that I've shown you mine,
it's your turn to show me yours.
Well, here she is.
Oh, goody, goody, goody.
Bring it to Papa.
Oh!
A thing of beauty, huh?
A joy forever.
And where's the mask?
I want my mask. Come on.
Oh! So you're working
with MacDougal on this, huh?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huhnn...
I would suggest that you have
a little tête-à-tête with your partner.
If he's still in the country.
In the meantime, I'm gonna hold on
to the access card and the goggles.
Conrad, you've gotta believe me.
I had no idea.
- I swear to God, I'd never do this to you.
- Don't... Don't pout at me, you little bitch!
- Come on, Conrad.
- Get outta here. Get out! Go!
Just get out.
Get outta here!
Baby, I'm glad to see you.
I'm calling it off.
You take this.
I'll get the Rembrandt for you later.
Slow down, Mac.
What you sayin'?
She's over her head.
It's not going to happen.
What about this other big, giant, huge job
you were all cute about in Scotland, hm?
You wouldn't be tryin' to cut me out
of anything, would you?
There's nothing to cut you out of.
Sit down, Mac.
Sit down.
I said, sit the fuck down.
You know, Mac?
I think it's time to take
your girlfriend out of the equation
- and get down to the you-and-me of it all.
- She's not my girlfriend.
See, I been gettin' this little Yoko vibe,
like all of a sudden
your girlfriend's the one in control.
Now, you change partners,
you change the rules.
And the rules are:
Mac does the job, I watch Mac's back.
You don't call off nothin' unless I say so.
Where is it, you bastard?
I trusted you!
- You bastard! I trusted you.
- Gin. Hey... Gin...
Where is it?
Why'd you take it?
Get up.
I know you're faking.
Ohh!
Where'd you go?
Why'd you take it?
- I was going to sell it.
- Then why didn't you?
Because... I... couldn't do it.
Why not?
I knew that if I told you to forget this job,
to get the hell outta here...
you wouldn't do it, would you? Hm?
- No.
- Mm. Right.
- Were you worried about me, Mac?
- Well, yes.
- Were you?
- I was worried about both of us.
- Don't be.
- Hm.
Whoops, sorry.
Forgot about the rules.
Mm.
Have you ever broken 'em, Mac?
No.
- Not once?
- No.
- Never?
- Never.
Alone is... good, eh?
No. Bullshit.
I hate alone.
Alone sucks.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Mm.
Hey... Gin...
Gin... Gin...
Gin...
- Gin... Gin...
- What?
My situation is...
so complicated...
I can't...
I can't explain.
Well, can you try?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I love you, too, guys.
Hey! What are you doing?
Get off me.
Help!
Hector...
What are you doing here?
Oh, I read in the newspapers
that the mask thing's gone down,
and I don't hear a peep from
my trusty agent, so naturally I worry.
I call the hospitals, I call the morgue,
and, finally, I call the airlines.
I'm a man badly in need
of news here, Miss Baker.
- Help me out.
- You want news, Hector?
OK. The news is, I don't appreciate
you blowing my cover like this.
He's planning a job that's
gonna make the mask look like...
You don't believe me? Fine.
Then pull me in and pick him up.
Why would I pull you in when you
seem to be getting so close to Mac?
Oh, jeez.
- This was business, Hector.
- Business...
Are you sure there's nothing else
you wanna tell me?
Look, give me until tomorrow.
I promise you, you'll have it all.
Can I go back to work now?
Don't lose her.
Guess she didn't appreciate my pictures.
Did I tell you, or did I tell you?
- She's screwin' you both, man.
- She says it's business and I believe her.
Oh, yeah. I'm sure she's probably
on her way over to see Mr Mac right now
- and do a little "business".
- Don't do that. You do not do that!
- You do not speak like that!
- Hector. Hector, baby.
There ain't no need
to get all up and hard, my man.
I said I'd make this trip worth your while.
You better be right.
All you gotta do is listen to old Thibadeaux.
I've never felt so underdressed in all my life.
Synchronise...
now.
OK. The dish should be
coming on-line, hopefully.
Every minute, from now to midnight,
we steal a tenth of a second
from our friends
at the International Clearance Bank.
They're still there.
So, uh, be careful, OK?
Wait.
- Gin...
- No, don't... Don't say a word.
Shoot!
Hey, have you seen a guy in blue overalls?
Four to Base.
No, I'm sorry, sir. I lost him.
I don't know. Just somewhere
between the stairs and the truck. Yeah.
Ma'am.
Boys, this is Chief Inspector Yeng San,
and that's Mr Cruz
from Waverly Insurance, New York.
They have a special interest
in a couple of our guests tonight.
Elevator. One minute.
It's not working.
This one's not working.
I'd use that one.
Do try to put a smile on your face, dear.
So, this is your international
art thief, Mr Cruz.
He doesn't look very dangerous, does he?
Not yet.
OK... And now...
Now time stands still.
Hopefully.
Excuse me.
Did you see where they went?
- 70th floor, sir.
- Watching the fireworks, probably.
Right. Do you have cameras up there?
- Yes, of course.
- Would you mind?
Mmm.
- I can't find them, sir.
- What do you mean, you can't find them?
Sir, I... I just can't find them.
There are over 2,000 cameras
in this building. Find them!
Listen, I don't mean to intrude,
but these people are very, very smart.
If they've disappeared,
it's because they mean to.
- Have you got any art in this building?
- Some.
- And the Bank Clearance House?
- Nothing but a big computer.
Something doesn't smell right.
Well, Mr Cruz,
on the say-so of you
and your friends in the FBI,
I have a lot of men on standby here.
What would smell right to you?
I think you should pick them up.
Sonic pulse.
Five milliseconds.
- Now, put your feet down...
- Between the pulses, I know.
Now...
Three, two, one...
And...
- Two.
- Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven. Eight.
Nine. Ten.
Eleven. Twelve.
Fingerprint brush.
Now, kill... mosquito... cannon...
"Don't use a cannon to kill a mosquito. "
- Confucius.
- You are good.
This is it?
Whatever happened to money?
- Gimme the goggles.
- Stuff you can get your hands on.
Oh, God.
This is why I don't do banks anymore.
There used to be bars of gold,
safety-deposit boxes...
I mean, where's the good old-fashioned loot?
The loot, my dear...
.. is right in there.
20 seconds.
- Prepare to go off-line in KL in...
- Five, four...
- This is for real, people.
- .. three, two, one, go.
They're ten seconds early.
Why are the Americans
always in such a hurry?
- Ten seconds in.
- FDZ complete.
Clear.
- Approaching fifteen.
- Clear.
- Here we go.
- Clear.
- All clear.
- Ten seconds.
Five, four, three...
- Three seconds, people!
- .. two, one...
We're clear.
Happy New Year, Malaysia.
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Come on.
.. seven, six,
five, four, three,
two, one...
- We did it!
- Happy New Year.
Happy Millennium.
That was perfect.
Ah, Gin..
The disk.
- Get me the spanner.
- The what?
The wrench!
If they find that disk, we're dead.
The door.
I can't stop it, Mac.
Armed Response Unit, Code Red.
Leave it. Come on!
- Elevator five's on the move, sir.
- Who's in it?
- It's empty.
- No. I think... I think they're still in it.
They freeze-framed the camera. See?
Shut it down.
There's always a surprise.
Here.
Suspects in the vicinity of floor 50.
OK, Mr Cruz, your friends are rats in a trap.
- Where to?
- Service elevators.
Get out. Out! Out!
Let's try the stairs.
Get back.
Hang on.
I got a better idea.
Temper, temper, Mr MacDougal.
Confirm suspects on floor 50,
heading south away from the gas.
They'll think we'll try to avoid the gas,
so try to keep your eyes closed
and take a deep breath.
Get back.
Here.
- What's this?
- Plan B pack.
- For what?
- If we need it, I'll tell you.
Now, if we can get across the vent shaft,
we should be OK.
Across where?
There.
Let's go.
Oh!
OK.
Move it.
Keep moving.
Come on.
Oh, God.
Gin! Watch out.
Gin! We're nearly there.
Move it.
Come on.
Oh, God.
Next stop, vent shaft.
Armed police!
Put your hands above your head.
Do not move.
I repeat, remain where you are.
SWAT team to the roof.
SWAT team to the roof.
Let's go, let's go.
Move, move, move.
If you can't feel alive now,
you never will.
Go!
Control, we have a clean shot.
Do we take it? I repeat, do we take it?
Negative, Team Leader.
Negative. Do you copy?
I want these people alive and kicking.
Go! Get up into the shaft.
Come on.
Now...
- Plan B. Turn around.
- What?
Turn around.
This is a mini-chute.
But it only works with the updraft.
I'm not going without you.
We go together.
No, no, no. Too heavy.
We'd drop like stones.
So when will I see you again?
Meet me tomorrow morning,
6.30 at the Pudu train station.
- You'd better be there, OK? Promise me.
- I will be there.
I will be there.
I'm never late.
If I'm late, it's because I'm dead. Now...
Rip cord.
Ho!
My God. Mac!
- Agh!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Rough night.
- I'm sorry. Are you all right?
- So what's wrong?
- Wrong? Nothing's wrong.
Everything is the... way it has to be.
- What?
- Virginia Baker?
- Special Agent Aaron Thibadeaux, FBI.
- Come on!
You're under arrest for grand larceny.
You have the right to remain silent.
Mac?
- Mac!
- Anything you say
can be used
against you in a court of law.
Thanks, Mac.
You got your one minute.
- You're a cop.
- No.
Well, not exactly.
Thibadeaux, believe it or not, is FBI.
And two years ago he caught me
and, uh, cut a deal.
The deal was that...
I had to deliver you.
They've been onto you for quite a while.
- And Cruz knew, too?
- No, he's just found out.
I don't get it.
Why didn't you pick me up before?
What were you waiting for?
Well, at first I, uh...
Well, I wanted to see if you could do it.
Bullshit. Come on.
And I wanted to see if I could do it.
Weren't we partners?
- I can't believe you'd do this to me.
- Well, you'd better believe it. Hm?
It's all over.
I gave them Greene,
the Rembrandt, the mask,
and the full seven billion.
What do you mean, seven?
So you'll just have to make do with one, hm?
- I thought you said one minute.
- Relax, Hector. He knows what he's doin'.
Now, plan C.
In your pocket, you'll find an envelope.
A passport, visa, money.
Where you go from here is up to you.
And you'll still hold the record... alone.
Mac!
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?
Well, believe me...
I was prepared for everything, except you.
Mac!
- Time's up.
- Come with me.
Gin...
Your life, it's all ahead of you.
Mine... This is all I've got.
No. You've got me.
You got me.
Listen carefully.
In your other pocket...
Let's do it.
- Move and I blow his head off.
- Everybody, just be cool.
- Nobody move! No-one moves, OK?
- Fellas, put your weapons down.
- You, too, Hector. I swear I'm gonna kill him.
- Relax. We'll get her at the next stop.
Bye, Mac.
She's headed towards the next station.
Move! Move it! No guns!
- Get out of here. Now!
- Move it! Move it!
You know, I don't know
what just went down here,
but I'm gonna see that you're busted
out of the Bureau for it.
- It ain't over, Mac.
- I believe you.
Well, Mac, this looks like
the end of a terrible friendship.
But you still owe me for today.
I always pay my debts.
Four prototype superchips.
Value: five million dollars each.
Hope she was worth it.
Oh, she was.
I'll be seein' you, Mac.
I don't think so.
OK, Bob, let the people back on the platform.
And bring me a damn car.
- How did you do it?
- I jumped trains mid-station.
When the train slowed down, I just...
It was perfect.
Was it now?
You know what, Mac?
- I don't wanna hold the record alone.
- No?
- I need your help on another job.
- The Crown Jewels or something?
No! Come on, too easy.
I was thinking of...
I know this guy in South Africa.
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds.
The biggest diamonds
you'll ever see in your life.
Have I told you
how much I love diamonds?
Mac?
Mac.
Mac!
What!
So, what do you think?
- About what?
- About my idea.
It's doable.
- Ohh!
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
