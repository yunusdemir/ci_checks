Wait, just wait
a little while,
soon the bogeyman will come to you
with his chopping knife.
He'll cut small pieces out of YOU!
You're out!
Wait, just wait
a little while,
soon the bogeyman will come to you
with his chopping knife.
He'll cut small pieces out of...
I told you not to sing
that horrible rhyme!
Can't you get that
through your heads?
Always that cursed rhyme!
Wait, just wait
a little while,
soon the bogeyman will come...
Oh, Lord!
What a nightmare of a staircase.
What's wrong?
You can keep telling those rascals
not to sing
that dreadful murderer rhyme.
They'll still keep
getting on your nerves with it -
as if one didn't hear enough
about the murderer anyway.
Let them be.
As long as you can hear them singing
you at least know
they're still there.
Yeah, you're right, I guess.

"Who Is The Murderer?
"Since Monday, June 11, this year,
the following children are missing:
"The pupils Kurt Klawitzkin
and his sister Klara,
"last known residence
in the Müllerstrasse 470.
"Several indications suggest
"that these children
might have fallen victim to a crime
"similar to that committed
on the Doering siblings last autumn."
You've got a pretty ball!
What's your name, child?
Elsie Beckmann.
Didn't Elsie come back with you?
Nah - not with us she didn't!
Beautiful!
Thank you so much.

Yeah, sure...
Just a minute, Herr Gehrke.
By the way, Herr Gehrke...
Yeah?
You haven't seen little Elsie?
No... Didn't she just
come up the stairs before me?
No. She's still not home.
Well, she'll be along soon then.
Good day, Frau Beckmann!

"The Terror Of Our City
Has Claimed A New Victiml"
Speak up there! Can't hear a thing.
"Several leads are indicating
that this latest murder
"was committed by
the same monstrous fiend
"who already has claimed
eight children of our city.
"It has to be continuously stressed
"that it is the most sacred duty
of any mother or father
"to warn their children
more than ever before
"of this enormous danger
which continues to persist,
"especially since that danger
most likely approaches them
"in the most friendly disguise.
"A piece of candy, a toy,
even an apple
"could lure these children
into certain doom."
Geez... awful!
Well - go on!
"The understandable unease among the
general public is being heightened
"by the fact that the intense efforts
by the police to make an arrest
"have so far, unfortunately,
failed to bear any fruit.
"On the other hand the police
face the almost impossible task
"to apprehend a culprit who
has yet to leave any trace behind.
"Who is the murderer?
"What does he look like?
"Where is he hiding?
"Nobody seems to know him,
"and yet, he is right among usl
"And anybody sitting next to you
could be the murdererl"
Right! Very true!
What are you looking at me for?
Well... you'll know.
What am I supposed to know?
Well, think about it.
It'll come to you.
What do you mean by that?
That I saw you going after
the little girl from the fourth floor
as she was walking up the stairs.
You're crazy, you swine!
Who's the swine here? Me?
Or the guy who's after little girls?
You bastard!
You... you... damn scoundrel!
MURDERER!
But, gentlemen, gentlemen, please!
You - I'm gonna see you in court!
I'll have you put behind bars!
You... damn slanderer!
Character assassin!
Damn slanderers.
This is character assassination!
And the police give credence to this!
With a search warrant even.
What a terrible disgrace.
You turn the house upside down
'cause of an anonymous note.
Now, now, calm down, Herr Jaeger.
We're just doing our duty.
As if it isn't enough that
we don't have a single quiet moment
out of fear for our children.
See? That's precisely why
the police have to follow every lead.
Anyone on the streets
could be the murderer!
Can you tell me what time it is?
Of course, my child.
Hurry home now.
Where do you live, child?
What business is it of yours,
where the little girl lives?
Begging...
...your pardon?
What do you want of the kid?
I want absolutely nothing!
What do you want of me, anyway?
You'll see what I want of you!
Let go of me!
This is outrageous!
- What's going on here?
- Outrageous, I say!
- What's with the old foghorn?
- Stop fussing.
Giving little kids the come-on...
- Get him on the chin!
- What did he say?
- Getting fresh, too, huh?
- Please, let me go!
- I didn't even approach her!
- Wanted to kidnap her, eh?
- And kill her like the others!
- This is the murderer!
- Grab him!
- Call the police.
Typical - no copper around.
Officer! Officer!
Officer! Officer!
Make way, gentlemen.
Clear the stairs.
Arresting a small-fry pickpocket
is the best you can manage.
Go catch the murderer!
What? That's the child murderer?
- The murderer?
- This is the child murderer?
Move along! Don't loiter. Move along!
- Look! The murderer!
- The monster!
Drag him down here! Grab him!
The murderer! Get him!
Tackle him! Why don't you tackle him?
Move along, people. Let us through!
"Murderer Writes To The Press.
"Since the police withheld my first
letter from the eyes of the public,
"I now turn directly to the pressl
"Make your inquiries -
you'll soon get confirmation.
"But I'm not finished yetl"
This is a scandal
of enormous proportions.
Can you imagine the impact
a note like this will have
on public opinion, Commissioner?
This is simply ir-res-ponsible!
Mr Secretary,
we cannot prevent the murderer
from writing to whoever he wants.
Perhaps this severely pathological
man is getting great satisfaction
out of the media coverage
his crimes get.
We've contacted
the newspaper's editors
and the note has been handed over.
It's being examined by
our forensic department as we speak.
Of course it's nearly impossible
to take any fingerprints
from a piece of paper
that's gone through so many hands.
Nonetheless,
no stone will be left unturned
in the hope that by comparing
the findings to our records
we'll come up with something
that'll bring us closer
to closing this case.
After that the note will be examined
by graphology.
The aforementioned
diamond-shaped and swelling sweeps -
open brackets -
especially in the word 'soon',
third paragraph from the bottom -
close brackets...
- You got that?
- Yes.
...clearly underlines
the strong pathological sexual state
of this sex offender.
Period.
The partially disrupted and uneven
style of his other handwriting
is in its interpretation
a form of acting
that to everyone else would take on
the face of indolence, even lethargy.
In the general style
of his handwriting
lies a hint of a hardly provable,
yet intensely perceptible aura
of MADNESS.
Yes, yes, of course, Commissioner.
I don't doubt for a moment
that you are doing your duty.
Yes, as do your men on the force.
Of course!
But to what end, please? To what end?
Mr Secretary, my men haven't had
even 12 hours sleep in a full week!
The swat teams
aren't getting a moment's peace,
and at the beginning of their shifts
they're almost more fatigued
than at the end!
Our work is unnerving
yet painstaking and detailed
and 80% if not even 90%
of our leads are false.
The men of the murder squad
haven't even changed their clothes.
They're constantly on call,
always on alert!
They're prepared to follow every lead
without hesitation -
every single lead
that presents itself -
as it could possibly be
the one that solves the case.
Mr Secretary, consider the search
at the crime scene!
To give you an example -
just behind a picket fence,
in the bushes,
a small, crumpled paper wrapping
was found.
Apparently,
it once contained cheap sweets.
In the outermost corner
of this wrapper
we found traces of fruit drops
and powdered sugar particles.
We've tried to trace
the origin of this wrapper
in every coffee shop and grocer's
within a two-kilometre radius,
to no avail.
With every day that passes
we widen the drag net.
But, of course
no one remembers anything
that would provide any leads
since so much time has passed.
Despite all these setbacks,
we're forced to continue searching
for clues, examining all avenues -
always facing uncertainty
and starting out
with little chance of success
in bringing this case
even one step toward its conclusion.
Our men are doing everyth...
What good is all this?
Commissioner, I'm aware that
you're not putting your feet up!
But this doesn't change the fact
that an unknown killer
is terrorizing 4.5 million people!
And that the police are incompetent!
His Excellency apparently
doesn't have a clear picture
of what enormous difficulties
the force has to deal with right now.
Are you aware, for instance,
that when it comes to the route
the child was taking to get home
there are at least 15 varying,
if not conflicting,
eyewitness accounts alone?
Here's a random example.
Questioning of witnesses -
file number 1478 -
re: Beckmann murder case...
- You ain't got a clue!
- More than you do, mister!
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
You must have some idea of the colour
of the little girl's cap
that you said you saw around lunch
time with the suspected murderer.
Of course, Inspector!
It was red.
Inspector, the cap was green!
- It was red! Red!
- It was green! Green!
- Red! Red!
- Green! Green!
Enough! Enough! This is pointless.
Thank you for coming, gentlemen.
You're welcome.
Bring in the next.
Look, if you're relying on
a colour-blind man for clues,
it's no wonder you're going
out of business, Inspector!
In their hunt for the killer so far
the police have followed up
on 1,500 detailed leads.
The files on this case
already cover 60 thick volumes.
We've dispatched
all our available forces
to systematically comb
the surrounding areas of the city.
Every undergrowth and thicket,
every tree in a plantation
is carefully examined,
since in any bush or under any leaf
a potential clue may be hiding
that could finally put us
on the right track.
We have the best trackers
with their sniffer dogs
going over even the slightest traces,
but they've lost the scent
and despite all efforts
failed to pick it up again.
Since the first murders
police officers have repeatedly
searched homeless shelters everywhere
and thoroughly checked the identities
of every vagrant in them.
Of course, this doesn't make
the police very popular
nor does it reduce the level
of tension in the general public.
The surveillance
of the railway stations
is being continuously maintained.
Still, the investigation
hasn't turned up any results yet,
nor have the nightly raids
in the underworld districts.
Coppers!
Quiet!
Go back! This is the police!
Move back!
Damn!
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
Let go of me,
you damn son of a bitch!
Let me go, I tell you! Let go!
Let go, son of a bitch!
Let me go! Let go!
Take your hands off her,
you damn copper!
Silence!
SILENCE! SILENCE!
Move back!
Look! The top copper!
- Silence!
- You'd like that, huh?

nobody leave this establishment!
Get your ID's ready.
Let me go!
Please!
Kids! Come on. Stop this racket.
Huh! Big fat Lohmann!
Lohmann! Lohmann!
Silence!
SILENCE!
It's pointless.
Why don't you go catch the murderer?
- Exactly!
- Bravo!
Bravo!
SILENCE!
Wake up to yourselves!
Make way there! Move! Coming through!
Move! Get going!
Present your papers!
Present your papers!
Haven't got any. Nope.
Come on, show your papers.
Officer, can't you let me go?
Sir, the two birds who tried escaping
have been caught in the Krangasse.
- Line them up!
- Shut up!
Have your papers ready!
- Haven't we met before?
- Yeah, so what?
Kids, we're going
to the Alex HQ again.
Even before the first quickie...
Come on, this is pointless!
Anyone who doesn't have their papers
will be taken to Headquarters
at Alexanderplatz!
Who cares? I don't.
I haven't done anything.
Ah, quit babbling, will ya?
Hummel! Hummel!
Silence! Present your papers!
Where's the blue Minna?
One at a time!
Don't panic -
everyone will be served tonight.
Silence! Silence!
Cool it, kids!
Get your papers ready!
Where are your papers?
My dear Inspector, you expect me
to carry my birth certificate around?
- Stop bitchin', my dear.
- No, really, you can't expect...
Alex HQ!
What? This is a dump!
Poor craftsmanship, boy!
They got the better of you.
Alex HQ!
So long, Willy! Toodle-oo!
Oh, leave me alone.
Next!

Next one!
Papers?
Don't have them.
Alex!
Tough luck.
Alright. Next!
"Ladies"
You're wrecking my whole business,
Sergeant.
All these raids every night.
No one gets a breather anymore.
They're human beings too, you know!
Do you think we spend all these
nights up because we like to?
No, but you're driving
my customers away,
and you won't find
the one you're lookin' for anyway!
If you knew how mad they are
about the pig
that got them into this every night!
Especially the girls,
even if they hustle -
business is business -
but believe me, Sergeant,
in every one of them is a mother!
I know lots of heavies who get
all teary when they see kids playing.
If they were to get that monster,
you'd have to pick him up
like toothpicks, I tell ya!
Ready to leave, Sergeant.
See ya.
They got
the 'Little Crocodile' today.
Two trucks!
I wonder where Schränker is.
Is it 3:00 yet?
I'll find out.
Oh, Miss, what's the exact time,
please?
2:58? Thank you!
Two... fifty... eight.
The coppers are all over the streets
like ants again.
Green coats wherever you spit.
They don't even let you
have fun with the girls.
They've gone wacky, too - nothin'
on their minds but the murderer.
Mine has a little girl,
she's six, right?
Now I've gotta look below the bed
three times a night
to check if the murderer is there.
You can't do business anymore
'cause you're always
stumbling over coppers.
No private life, either.
I've had it, I tell ya!
So what's new?
What's keeping Schränker?
They wouldn't have caught him, right?
- Nah!
- Him? Not in your life!
He robbed a bank in London once
where Scotland Yard
had set a trap for him.
He was hands up against the wall
with coppers all around him
and two seconds later
three corpses were lying there...
...but he wasn't among them!
The best man
between Berlin and Frisco.
They've been looking for him
for six years, with no luck!
Yeah, but put enough dogs
on the fox's trail...
Shut up!
Goddammit!
I can't take this!
He was always on time before.
- Thank God.
- Finally!
Mornin'!
Are you crazy? Close the blinds!
Gentlemen, I open this meeting.
For matters of protocol
I declare all division leaders
of this organisation are present.
I assume that you are empowered
to make binding decisions
in the name of your divisions.
Good.
Needn't bother with unnecessary
introductions as to subject -
we all know why we're here.
An outsider is wrecking our business
and revenue.
The counter measures by the police,
the nightly raids
to catch this... child murderer
are seriously undermining our work
in an intolerable way.
It is no longer acceptable
that we're not safe now at any hotel,
pub, cafe or even private home
from the grip of the police.
- Very true.
- Bravo!
This siege has got to end.
We have to get things under control,
or we go bust.
Our organisation's resources
are nearly depleted.
If we can't get funds to support
the wives of those members
who currently get their meals
courtesy of the state's prison system
I don't know
how we can finance our activities.
It also hurts our reputation.
The police seek the murderer
in our fold.
Gentlemen, when I run head-on
into an officer from the squad
he knows the potential risks,
as I do.
If one of us dies
in performing his activity, fine.
That is occupational hazard.
But between who the police
are looking for and us
is where we draw the line!
- Very true.
- Right!
We are doing our job
in order to survive,
but this monster
has no right to survive.
It must disappear,
be eliminated, exterminated,
without mercy or scruples!
Gentlemen...
...our members have to go back
to their regular business
without having to face
constant interference from police.
I ask your...
...opinions, gentlemen.
Increase ID checks, systematic
searches of the whole city,
and raids -
relentless, hard-hitting raids!
We need informers!
We need to know about police activity
almost before they do themselves!
The girls should throw themselves
onto the coppers more!
How often was one of us nabbed
because his girl sang to the cops?
Now they can rat out the coppers!
Every home-owner, landlord,
everyone owning property,
must be forced to consent
to detailed searches for clues.
We have our connections -
if we were to put an article
into a paper
that our...
well, respectable organisations
don't want to be classed
with this monster,
that the cops should
look for this pig somewhere else...
Hell, he's not even a real hoodlum!
This is perhaps a man who is -
aside from his urge to kill -
a normal-looking citizen
who wouldn't hurt a fly.
Perhaps when he is not
in the state of madness
he plays marbles
with his landlady's kids
or he plays cards with friends.
Without the -
let me put it this way -
private normality
that these murderers have,
it would've been impossible
for the likes of Grossman or Haarmann
to have lived right next to
their neighbours for years
without revealing even a clue
to their true character.
This is where we should focus
the public's attention.
They have to cooperate.
Public cooperation, my foot!
Just thinking of it makes me vomit.
I beg your pardon, Commissioner.
Sorry!
But...
...ain't it the truth?
What the devil did we gain so far
from public cooperation?
Piles of letters
with the most unbelievable slanders.
Very true.
They call the murder squad
whenever a chimney sweep walks by.
Right!
But when you really want
some information from them,
they suddenly haven't a clue.
They can't recall anything at all.
That's public cooperation for you!
I think you're exaggerating a little,
Lohmann.
It's not that bad, is it?
It is, Commissioner!
Most of the public still think,
"What's it to me?"
It never occurs to the masses
that what happens to even the poorest
or most unknown child on the street
is a matter
for everyone's conscience.
I've got another idea!
There was this magician.
What's his name...?
Well, anyway, he could get money
out of people's pockets.
I mean...
The reward money
is still far too low.
Commissioner, the man leading us
to the murderer should get a fortune!
That's nothing new.
This is all leading nowhere.
Should we wait until the police
catch the guy instead?
The obstacles in solving crimes
like these are often insurmountable,
since perpetrator and victim
are usually only connected
by the crime itself.
The instincts of the moment
dictate the murderer's moves.
The victim is found, identified,
the last known whereabouts
are established,
and then...
...then all that's left
is a big question mark.
The children vanish without a trace.
And when they are found...
...well, you know how we found them.
And the perpetrator...
It's a very well-known fact
that murderers like this
rarely leave a clue behind.
That's what makes our work so hard,
our successes so few.
The police have been hunting
the murderer for eight months.
They'll only get him by accident now.
Can't wait for that!
We'll be broke by then.
What then?
We have to catch him!
We ourselves!
Yes! That's what we must do!
There is perhaps another way.
Files on the person we're after
must already exist.
That person,
being a pathological case,
no doubt already had some kind of
contact with the authorities.
That's why we have to get
the care facilities,
prisons, clinics and insane asylums
to support us unequivocally.
We specifically need information
on those who were released
as no danger to society
but who by their nature are a threat.
We'll cover the city
with a net of informants.
Every square mile must
be under continuous control.
Not a single child must take a step
without us knowing it!
Alright. But how?
And who?
They have to be inconspicuous -
people who can follow anyone
without attracting attention,
who can follow children to every
house without causing mistrust -
in a word,
people who do not alert the murderer.
- But who? Who?
- There are no such people!
- Who could do that?
- Who?
Who?
The beggars!
The organisation of beggars!

You're telling me...
DOES A HERR BECKERT LIVE HERE?
Herr Beckert? Oh, yes,
Herr Beckert lives here, yes.
Unfortunately he just went out.
Is that so? Huh.
I would've liked to talk to him.
I'm from Inland Revenue, you know.
Inland Revenue? Well, perhaps
you'd like to wait for him?
Yeah. Thank you.
My pleasure.
Make yourself comfortable until then.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Would you like something to read?
- Thank you. Terribly nice of you.
- Pleasure.

Yes?
Does Herr Beckert have his own

Herr Beckert? Oh, no!
He always borrows mine.
That so? Alright. Thanks again.

- Hello!

Hey, what's up?

Listen! Somebody's whistling.
Can't you hear it? There!
Now he's stopped.
Did you see the guy
who was whistling?
Yeah, I can still see him.

He's walking up the road with her.

You've soiled your coat.
Where?
There! On the shoulder.
Here, I'll wipe it off.
But... what's wrong?
Come! We're leaving!
He didn't come out this way.
We would've seen him!
Out of the question!
He must be here somewhere.
He didn't turn back.
Damn it! He has to be somewhere!
Perhaps... he's hiding inside.
Shift!
Man, let's hope he doesn't escape
when the employees
leave their offices!
If he slips through now...
- Here come the first!
- Quick! Back on the road! Look out!
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?
My first transport is tomorrow.
I'll start in Königsberg.
No, I can't stomach
anything like that.
Guess what?
The boss was in my office today.
Better turn off the light,
otherwise he'll get suspicious
when he comes home
and finds everything illuminated.
What time is it, anyway?
Almost half past six.
He's gotta to be in there!
He definitely wasn't with
the people who left the building.
That so? Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah. No!
Hang on!
The beggars have called for backup
and surrounded the whole building.
They reckon the guy
is hiding in that building!
What's in there?
What kind of building is it?
Just a business complex.
I don't know what's in the cellar.
On the ground floor is a branch
of the local savings bank,
from the first to the fifth floor
there are offices,
and above is the loft.
This is unbelievable!
Anybody still in there?
Hello?
Hello! Hello!
Anybody still in there?
What the devil?
Is anybody still there?
All this twiddling
because somebody overlooked...
...a damn door!
Yeah. Uh-huh.
It seems he's really trapped!
We'd better call the cops right away.
- I agree.
- But...
Give me that!
Hello? Stay by the phone
and call again in a few, alright?
You're crazy, right?
The police? No way!
We get him ourselves!
Look - it's now... what?
8:00.
Alright...
9:00...
...10:00...
At 11:00!
Evening. Do you realize
your gate is still open?
What? But that's impossible!
I made sure...
But it is loc...!
Open, quick! And not a sound!
Move! Hurry up!
Come on! Move it!
How many other watchmen
are in this building?
So you don't want to answer, huh?
Fine.
There are two other watchmen
in the complex.
Damn bloody shit!
Bloody piece of crap!
Oh, damn! Bloody shit!
Crap!
Be absolutely careful
with the lights.
And make sure nobody stomps
like buffaloes.
- What?
- He's not in the main basement.
We went through everything. No luck.
That so?
Friedemann and August
are searching the boiler room now.
- Hold it!
- That's the last one.
Go up to Emil,
he still needs someone.
- Right!
- Go! Go!
Schränker sent me.
Alright.
- Pay attention!
- Yeah?
This is a new kind of time clock...
...and this is the manual for it.
If they're not set
at exactly the right minute,
an alarm automatically goes off
at the nearest police station.
- Got it?
- Uh-huh.
Done. Now, have you got all that?
Hey, what kind of a clot
do you take me for?
Well...
He's not in the boiler room
or the coal-cellar.
That so?
We turned every coal brick
upside down.
Hey!
Are you completely daffy?
What if the doors are linked
to the security system?
Do you want the police here
in the next five minutes?
But we have to get in here
if we're gonna search the joint
systematically.
But not through the door, you idiot!
Go to the offices on the first floor,
then down through the ceiling.
Nothing.
Right. Off we go.
What's up?
Hey! Hey, what's up?
Hey, Paul, what is it?
Answer, damn it!
I heard someone knocking.
Where're you goin'?
Why are you running?
Wait! What's goin' on?
Wait, damn it!
Where's Schränker?
The loft. The loft. He's there!
I clearly heard someone knock!
In the loft! The loft!
Shh! Quiet!
Right...
Move!
He has to be in here!
Here's the light switch.
Open all storage sheds!
Got him! I found him!
He's hiding in the loft!
- Yeah?
- I heard someone knock!
I told Schränker
and they'll have him soon!
Just came down to fill you in.
If I wasn't so alert
we could've kept searching for hours!
The watchman!
3-1-4!
314!
Three-hundred and...
...fourteen.
Everybody out!
- What?
- Why?
The cops will be here
in five minutes!
- Damn it!
- You're crazy!
- How come?
- The watchman alerted them!
Let's get outta here!
Hold it! Quiet!
Five more minutes,
six more storage sheds.
Move! Get goin'!
What are you doing there?
Step aside!
He's not here.
Go on! Next door!
Come on! Faster!
He isn't here, either.
Alright, alright! Next door!
Quick! Next ones!
Only three minutes left!
Get moving! Quick!
There's no lock on this one at all!
- Open it, damn it!
- Can't!
- Something's blocking it.
- Let me.
Hurry up, damn it!
Only one minute left!
There! There he is! There's the dog!
Come on! Move it!
Everybody out?
Get goin', damn it!
Move it!
For heaven's sake, get goin'!
- What's keeping the others?
- Any moment now!
Well, if not they might as well
stay here, with or without the guy.
Scram! What in hell is keeping them?
Finally! Thank God!
Quick now! Go! Make it snappy!
He's not down here.
Hey, Willy,
why'd you pull up the rope ladder?
HEY! Willy!
Why did you pull up the rope ladder?
Idiots.
What's up?
Hands up!
But I'm holding on
to the rope ladder!
Come out!
But I'm really innocent this time...
...like a newborn baby!
You'll find it curious, Franz,
but... I believe your every word.
Huh?
Yeah? Well... then everything
is peachy, Inspector!
Then I can go now, right?
Just a moment!
Cigarette?
Oh, boy.
I'll take your word for it, Franz.
Provided...
...that you can tell me...
...who the man is who you turned
the whole building over for,
and that you have captured!
I don't get you, Inspector.
A man, you're saying?
I don't know nothing, Inspector.
You must've gotten
your wires crossed!
I don't have a clue.
Not the slightest.
Of course, of course.
There is just one thing
I don't understand -
that you're covering for
the same gang
that left you in a tough spot.
Fine pals that scram
when the going gets tough
and leave you to take the rap.
Despicable!
That routine... doesn't work on me,
Inspector, sir.
Now what?
So what can happen to me?
A bit of what you call
wilful damage to property - so what?
Nothing got pinched.
On the contrary, there was, sonny!
And no small change, either!
What? There was?
And how much?
You tell me something...
and I tell you something.
Already told you, I know nothing.
As you wish.
Then start using your head, Franz.
When one is all by himself
for, uh... two or three hours,
a lot of things can come back to mind
which one wouldn't recall earlier,
right?
Take him!
Have the watchman come in.
Watchman Damowatz.
Take a seat, please.
So, you said in your statement -
listen carefully now, you might
have to testify under oath later -
that you overheard
one of the burglars
tell the fellow who was watching you,
"We got himl I have found the guyl
He's in the loftl"
Is this true?
That's right, Inspec... Ow!
That's right, Inspector!
I'd always be prepared to...
...swear to it!
Fine! Then go home now
and try to relax a little.
But... stick around
in case we might need you.
Of course... Inspector, sir.
Good mornin', Inspector!
Mornin'.
Do you know whether Inspector Lohmann
is still in?
Ah, he's on the other line.
No, no, not necessary. Thanks.
I'll... uh... I'll come over myself.
What? That so?
Still not home yet, eh?
Well... did you also keep an eye
on that old Winkler woman?
Come in!
COME IN!
Am I disturbing you?
Nah - do come in.
Alright, listen.
The whole block
is under surveillance.
If he's coming home at all
he has to walk right into us.
So... stay on target.
If there's anything new
I'll be here at headquarters.
Blast!
What's on your mind?
I wanted to ask you...
...if you could do me a favour.
Eugh, what horrible sewage!
I wanted to ask you...
Well, why don't you read that first?
- A statement?
- Yeah.
Burglary in an office building.
Benno Street?
That's quite a respectable
part of town.
Well... perhaps not that respectable.
Now, that is goin' too far!
What in heaven's...? Did they
want to empty the whole joint?
What did they want with the coal?
Incredible! Unbelievable!
Curious...
Now, that's a hot one!
Ah, so the savings bank
was what they were after.
Good Lord!
What's that supposed to mean?
Now I'm confused.
They didn't even touch 'em?
What a bunch of idiots
this must've been.
I'll be damned!
Now, is that somethin'?
Nothing stolen...
...but a man taken...
...God knows where!
Dandy!
And Franz... keeps his trap shut.
He's afraid, of course.
I know the guy.
His type would rather
jump out of a fifth floor window
than be mixed up in a murder rap.
If we could...
...take him from that angle.
If you were to help me on that...
Yup!
I see where you're goin'!
Well, then let's get our good Franz!
You're wanted for questioning!
What? Four guys for me?
What's this?
Move it!
"Duty Register, Murder Squad"?
"Head of division...
"...lnspector Karl Lohmann"?
But what do I have to do with you?
With the murder squad?
Yeah, boy.
The case is now in my hands.
Ahhh.
But why?
Why?
You all did your job
just a tad too well.
One of the watchmen...
Dead?
Acting as an accessory to murder...
That's an ugly business, Franz.
Inspector,
I'm not gonna play anymore!
I don't want
anything to do with that!
I'll tell it all, everything I know!
That's very sensible,
but unfortunately too late.
But it can't be too late, Inspector!
It just can't!
I'll tell you everything I know -
even what we were looking for
in that damn building.
And?
The child murderer!
Wh... what?
Who?
The child murderer, Inspector.
Just a moment.
Always me...
This always has to happen to me!
Now, take a seat next to me, boy.
Right.
Now, let's be candid with each other.
Got it?
Yes, sir!
And God forgive you
if you pull something.
Alright.
So, what did your buddies
have to do with the murderer,
and where was the guy taken?
Well, Inspector...
...you know the old Kuntz & Levy
distillery?
The one that folded
during the Depression?
Right, and since then
it' been abandoned
and nobody gives a damn about it.
Move it!
Move!
Let me go!
What have I done to you?
You swine!
Let go of me!
Pack of bastards!
Swine!
What do you want of me?
What do you want of...?
Help!
HELP! Let me out!
Let me out!
I want out! I want to get out!
Let me out of here!
You'll never get out of here.
But gentlemen... I beg of you!
I don't even know
what you want of me.
I beg you, please let me leave.
This whole thing must be a mistake!
A mis...
Oh, no!
No mistake!
Out of the question!
This is no mistake!
No, no.
No mistake.
Recognise that?
It was just such a balloon you bought
for little Elsie Beckmann.
Just such a balloon!
EI... Elsie!
EI... Elsie!
No!
No! NO!
Where have you buried
little Marga Perl, you bastard?
But...
...but I never...
...I never even knew her!
Oh?
You never even knew her?
Never knew that one either, huh?
And her?
And you never knew her either, huh?
- Stop him!
- Grab him! Grab him!
- Stop him! Don't let him escape!
Watch out! The door!
- Let me out!
- Hold him!
Give him a hook to the chin!
Let go of me! LET GO OF ME!
Let me out of here!
OW!
Heave!
Heave! Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
You've no right
to treat me this way!
We'll show you that we do!
You have no right to hold me here!
Right? There's only one thing
right for you - death!
- Kill him!
- Kill that cowardly bastard!
Ice him!
Quiet!
Kill him! Kill him!
You spoke of 'right' just now.
We shall be your right.
All sitting here are experts
in the rule of law!
From six weeks in Tegel prison...
...to 15 years in Brandenburg.
They will make sure
that you'll get your right!
You'll even get a defence counsel.
Everything according to
law and order.
Defence counsel? Defence counsel?
I don't need a defence counsel!
Who wants to prosecute me?
You perhaps? YOU?
Hey, you,
if I were in your shoes
I wouldn't make big speeches, sir!
It's gonna be about your head -
just in case you hadn't noticed!
And who would you be?
I have the dubious pleasure
of defending you here!
But I'm afraid
it won't do you any good.
But... do you want to kill me?
Do you simply want to do me in?
We want to render you out of action,
that's what,
and we can only be absolutely
sure of that if you're dead.
But you can't just murder me!
I demand to be handed over
to the police!
I demand to be put before
a genuine court of law!
- That's a hot one!
- He's good!
You'd like that, wouldn't you, sonny?
Look who's talkin'!
So that you can invoke section 51
and spend your life
being cared for by the state!
And then you break out of the asylum
or you fall under amnesty,
and you're happy as can be,
free to enjoy your licence to kill -
since you're protected by law
due to insanity -
back to chasing little girls.
No way! No more of that!
Right!
You must be rendered harmless!
You must vanish!
- Bravo! The bastard has to go!
- But I can't help it!
I can't.
I really can't...
...help it!
That's an ancient one!
Standing before the judge,
we all "can't help it"!
What do you know?
What are you talking about?
Who are you, anyway?
Who are you?
All of you?
Criminals!
Probably proud of it, too -
that you can crack safes
or are cat burglars
or can cheat at cards!
All of these things, I think,
you could just as easily give up
if you'd learned something useful
or if you had jobs
or if you weren't such lazy prigs!
But I?
Can I...?
Can I do anything about it?
Have I not this curse on me?
The fire? The voice? The torment?
So, you're saying...
...that you HAVE to kill.
Always...
...always I have to roam the streets
and I always sense...
...that someone is following me.
It is me!
And I shadow myself!
Silently...
...yet I still hear it!
Yes!
Sometimes I feel like
I'm hunting myself down.
I want to run -
run away from me!
But I can't!
I can't flee from myself!
Must... must take the path
that it's urging me on
and run... run!
Endless streets...
I want off! I WANT OFF!
And with me run the ghosts
of the mothers...
...and children.
They never leave!
They are always present!
Always!
Always! ALWAYS!
Except...
...when I'm doing it...
...when I'm...
And then I don't remember anything.
Then...
...then I stand
in front of a billboard
and read what I've done,
and read and read.
What have I done?
But I don't remember anything!
But who's going to believe me?
Who knows...
...what's inside of me?
How it... cries out
and screams inside...
...when I have to do it...
Don't want to. Must!
DON'T WANT TO! MUST!
And then...
...a voice cries out.
I CAN'T LISTEN ANYMORE!
HELP!
I CAN'T!
I can't!
I can't!
I can't.
The accused has stated
that he cannot help himself.
Therefore...
...he must commit murder.
With that he has handed himself
the death sentence.
- Bravo!
- Quite right!
A man who claims about himself
that it was forced upon him
to destroy lives -
that man must be extinguished
like a bonfire!
Bravo!
That man must be obliterated!
Wiped out!
- Yeah!
- Right!
- Exactly!
- Bravo! Bravo!
Exactly what I think!
May I... address the court?
The counsel for the defence
has the floor.
The... very respected
previous speaker...
...who, if I am not mistaken,
is wanted in three cases
of manslaughter by the po...
That has no bearing on this case!
...has claimed
that the fact that my client
was acting compulsively
warrants the death sentence.
- That's right!
- Damn right!
Yet he commits an error in judgement,
because the very nature of compulsion
warrants an acquittal!
Oh, get outta here, will ya?
You gotta be nuts, or plastered...!
It is exactly the nature
of compulsion
that relieves him
of the responsibility of his crimes!
And what a man is not responsible for
he cannot be punished for, either!
That's ridiculous!
Do you mean to say
this monster should go free?
That he should live?
I mean to say that this man is sick.
A sick man should not be handed
to the executioner.
- He should be handed to the doctor!
- Will you guarantee his cure?
What does the state
build asylums for?
What happens
if he breaks out of the asylum?
Or is released as cured?
And one fine day
the killing starts all over?
Again the month-long hunt!
Again section 51!
Again the insane asylum!
Again break out or possible release!
And again..."must kill"!
And that's supposed to go on
indefinitely?
Killing a man who cannot
be held responsible for his crimes
is in nobody's right!
Not even the state's!
As for YOU, you'd have the least!
The state has to make sure
that this man is rendered harmless
so that he ceases to be
a danger to society.
You never had kids, did ya?
See? Then you never lost any, either.
But if you wanna know what it's like
when a kid is taken from you...
...then ask the parents of the kids
that he has taken from them!
Ask 'em about the days and nights
that they didn't know what happened!
And then, once they finally knew...
Why don't you ask the mothers?
You should ask the mothers!
Think you'd get mercy
from any of them
for the murderer of their kids?
- The woman is right!
- She sure is!
No mercy for the murderer!
- Let him have it!
- Slaughter that bastard!
Kill the monster!
Kill him!
- Put this animal to death!
- Slay him!
- Kill him!
- Yeah! Waste him!
- Get rid of him!
- Annihilate the monster!
Slaughter him! Slaughter him!
I will not be shouted down by you!
I will not allow an act of murder
in my presence!
I demand that this human being...
That is no human being!
...that this human being be given
the same protection by the law
rendered the common criminal!
Big deal!
I demand that he be handed over
to the police!
The police! Of all the dumb...!
In the name of the law...
In the name of the people...
This will not
bring our children back.
One has to...
...take more...
...care of them!
YOU!
