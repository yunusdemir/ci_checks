With the coming
of the Second world war..
...many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately...
...toward the freedom of the Americas
Lisbon became the great embarkation
point.
But not everybody could get to Lisbon
directly.
And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.
Paris to Marseilles..
...across the Mediterranean to Oran
Then by train, auto or foot across the
rim of Africa to Casablanca...
...in French Morocco
Here, the fortunate ones, through
money or influence or luck...
...might obtain exit visas and scurry
to Lisbon.
And from Lisbon to the new world
But the others wait in Casablanca
And wait and wait and wait
To all officers:
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.
lmportant!
May we see your papers?
I don't think I have them on me.
ln that case you'll
have to come along.
lt's possible that I....
Yes. Here they are.
These papers expired 3 weeks ago.
You'll have to come along!
-What is going on?
-I don't know, my dear.
Pardon me. Have you not heard?
We hear little, and understand even
less.
Two German couriers were found
murdered in the unoccupied desert.
This is the customary roundup of
liberals...
...and beautiful girls for Monsieur
Renault, the prÃ©fect of Police.
Unfortunately, refugees and the scum
of Europe gravitated to Casablanca.
Some have been waiting
years for a visa.
I beg of you, watch yourself.
Be on guard.
This place is full of vultures.
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!
-Thank you very much.
-Not at all.
What an amusing little fellow.
Waiter.
-How silly of me.
-What, dear?
I've left my wallet in the hotel.
Perhaps tomorrow
We'll be on the plane.
-Heil, Hitler!
-Heil, Hitler!
lt is good to see you again, Major
Strasser.
Thank you, thank you.
May I present Captain Renault, the
police prÃ©fect of Casablanca.
-Unoccupied France welcomes you.
-Thank you, Captain.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant
Casselle.
Captain Tonelli.
The ltalian service at your command.
How kind.
You may find the climate of
Casablanca a trifle warm.
We Germans must get used to all climates,
from Russia to the Sahara.
-Perhaps you weren't referring to weather.
-What else?
What has been done about the murder
of the couriers?
My men are gathering twice the
number of usual suspects.
-But we know who the murderer is.
-Good. ls he in custody?
No hurry. Tonight he'll
be at Rick's.
I've already heard about this
cafÃ©. And about Mr. Rick himself.
Waiting, waiting, waiting.
I'll never get out of here.
I'll die in Casablanca.
But can't you make it a little more?
Please?
Sorry, madame, but diamonds are
everywhere on the market.
Two thousand, four hundred.
All right.
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything--
lt's the fishing smack Santiago.
lt leaves at one tomorrow night from the
end of the marina. Third boat.
And bring 15 thousand francs, cash.
Remember, in cash.
Cheerio.
-Open up, abdul.
-Yes, professor.
-Waiter?
-Yes, madame?
Will you ask Rick if he'll have a
drink with us?
Madame, he never drinks with customers.
I have never seen it.
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?
Perhaps if you told him I ran the
2nd largest bank in Amsterdam.
2nd largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.
The leading banker in Amsterdam is
now a pastry chef in our kitchen.
We have something
to look forward to.
And his father is the bellboy.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.
Of all the nerve!
I know there is gambling in there.
You dare not keep me out.
What's the trouble?
I have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.
lf you think I'll be kept out,
you're very much mistaken.
Hello, Rick.
Your cash is good at the bar.
What? Do you know who I am?
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.
This is outrageous! I shall report
it to the Angriff.
You know, watching you now, one would
think you've done this all your life.
-What makes you think I haven't?
-Nothing.
-But when you first came, I thought--
-You thought what?
What right do I have to think?
May I?
Too bad about those two German
couriers, wasn't it?
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were clerks...
...today they are the
honored dead.
You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.
I forgive you.
Will you have a drink with me?
I forgot, you never drink with--
I'll have another, please.
You despise me, don't you?
lf I gave you any thought,
I probably would.
But why?
Do you object to the business I do?
But think of all the poor refugees who
must rot here if I didn't help them.
lt's not so bad. Through ways of my
own, I provide them with exit visas.
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.
But think of all the poor devils who
can't meet Renault's price.
I get it for them for haIf.
ls that so parasitic?
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.
Well, Rick, after tonight I will be
through with the whole business.
And I'm leaving, finally, this
Casablanca.
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?
Myself. I found myself
much more reasonable.
Look, Rick.
Know what this is?
Something that even you
have never seen.
Letters of transit
signed by General DeGaulle.
They cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.
One moment.
Tonight I'll be selling those for
more money than even I ever dreamed of.
And then, addio, Casablanca.
I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but somehow since you despise me...
...you are the only one I trust.
Will you keep these for me?
-For how long?
-An hour. Perhaps a little longer.
I don't want them overnight.
Don't be afraid of that.
Please keep them for me.
Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.
Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.
lf anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.
Rick...
...I hope you're more
impressed with me now.
lf you'll forgive me, I'll share
my good luck with your roulette wheel.
Just a moment.
I heard a rumor those German couriers
Were carrying letters of transit.
I've heard that rumor too.
Poor devils.
You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.
-Hello, Rick.
-Hello, Ferrari.
How's business at the Blue Parrot?
-Fine, but I'd like to buy your cafÃ©.
-lt's not for sale.
-You haven't heard my offer.
-lt's not for sale at any price.
-What do you want for Sam?
-I don't buy or sell human beings.
Too bad. That's Casablanca's
leading commodity.
ln refugees alone we could make
a fortune together in the black market.
Suppose you run your business,
and let me run mine.
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Suppose we do.
When will you realize that in this world
isolationism is not a practical policy?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for
him at the Blue Parrot.
I like it fine here.
-He'll double your pay.
-I don't have time to spend money now.
Sorry.
The boss, private stock...
...because, Yvonne, I love you.
Oh, shut up!
All right, all right. For you I shut up,
because, Yvonne, I love you.
Some Germans gave this check.
ls it all right?
Where were you last night?
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.
-Will I see you tonight?
-I never make plans that far ahead.
Give me another.
-Sascha, she's had enough.
-Don't listen to him. Fill it up.
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.
-Rick, I'm tired of having you--
-Sascha, call a cab.
-Come on, we're going to get your coat.
-Take your hands off me!
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?
What a fool I was
to fall for a man like you.
Go with her and be sure she gets home.
And come right back.
Yes, boss.
-Hello, Rick.
-Hello, Louis.
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.
Someday they may be scarce.
I think I shall pay a call
on Yvonne.
Maybe get her on the rebound.
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.
lf he gets a word in,
it'll be an ltalian victory.
The plane to Lisbon.
You would like to be on it?
Why? what's in Lisbon?
The clipper to America.
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with
a Senator's wife?
I like to think you killed a man.
lt's the romantic in me.
lt's a combination of all three.
And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?
My health.
I came here for the waters.
What waters?
We're in the desert.
I was misinformed.
Excuse me, Rick.
A gentleman inside
has won 20'000 francs...
...and the cashier
Would like some money.
I'll get it from the safe.
I'm so upset, Rick. You know I--
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.
I'm awfully sorry.
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your cafÃ©.
-Again?
-This is no ordinary arrest.
A murderer, no less.
lf you're thinking of warning him,
don't. He cannot possibly escape.
-I stick my neck out for nobody.
-A wise foreign policy.
We could have made the arrest
earlier at the Blue Parrot.
But out of my high regard for you,
We're staging it here.
lt will amuse your customers.
Our entertainment's enough.
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.
Major Strasser of the
Third Reich.
We want him to be here when
We make the arrest.
A demonstration of the efficiency of my
administration.
I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.
-Perhaps not.
-Here you are.
-lt shall not happen again.
-That's all right.
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it?
How observant you are.
As a matter of fact,
I wantod to give you a word of advice.
Yeah?
-Have a brandy?
-Thank you.
There are many exit visas sold in this cafÃ©,
but we know that you've never sold one.
That is the reason
We permit you to remain open.
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.
That is another reason.
There is a man arrived in
Casablanca on his way to America.
He will offer a fortune to anyone who'll
furnish him with an exit visa.
-What's his name?
-Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo?
That is the first time
I've seen you impressed.
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.
lt's my duty to see he doesn't impress
the other haIf.
Rick, Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.
lt'll be interesting
to see how he manages.
-Manages what?
-His escape.
-But I just told you--
-Stop it.
He escaped concentration camp.
The Nazis chased him through Europe.
This is the end of the chase.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
ls that a serious offer?
I just paid out 20 and I'd like
to get it back.
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.
Done.
No matter how clever he is, he needs
an exit visa. Or I should say two.
-Why two?
-He is traveling with a lady.
-He'll take one.
-I think not. I've seen the lady.
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...
...he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.
lt doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?
Because I suspect that under that
cynical shell...
...you are at heart
a sentimentalist.
Laugh if you will, but I happen to be
familiar with your record.
Let me point out just two items:
ln 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.
ln 1936, you fought in Spain on the
Loyalist side.
And got well paid on both occasions.
The winning side would
have paid you much better.
Maybe.
lt seems you're determined to
keep Laszlo here.
I have my orders.
I see. Gestapo spank.
My dear Rick, you overestimate the
influence of the Gestapo.
I don't interfere with them, and
they don't interfere with me.
ln Casablanca, I am master of my fate.
-I am--
-Major Strasser is here, sir.
-You were saying?
-Excuse me.
Carl, see that Major Strasser gets a
good table, close to the ladies.
I gave him the best, knowing he is
German and would take it anyway.
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.
-Everything is ready, sir.
-Go ahead.
-Good evening, gentlemen.
-Good evening, Captain.
-Won't you join us?
-Thank you.
lt's a pleasure to have you here,
Major.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
May I recommend veuve Clicquot '26, a
good French wine.
-A very interesting club.
-Especially tonight, Major.
ln a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.
I expected no less, Captain.
Monsieur Ugarte.
-Will you come with us?
-Cortainly.
May I first cash my chips?
Very lucky, hm? 2'000, please.
Rick! Help me!
-Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
-But Rick, hide me, do something!
Excellent, Captain.
When they come to get me, Rick,
I hope you'll be more of a help.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
I'm sorry there was a disturbance,
folks, but it's all over now.
Just sit down and enjoy yourselves.
All right, Sam.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich
Strasser of the Third Reich.
-How do you do, Mr. Rick.
-How do you do.
You already know Herr Heinz of the
Third Reich.
Please join us, Mr. Rick.
We are very honored tonight, Rick.
Major Strasser is one reason the Third
Reich enjoys the reputation it has.
You repeat Third Reich as if
you expectod there to be others.
Personally, Major,
I will take what comes.
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?
-Unofficially, of course.
-Make it official if you like.
-What is your nationality?
-I'm a drunkard.
And that makes Rick
a citizen of the world.
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.
There seems to be no secet
about that.
Are you one of those people who can't
imagine Germans in their beloved Paris?
lt's not particularly
my beloved Paris.
Can you imagine us in London?
When you get there, ask me.
Diplomatist!
How about New York?
There are sections of New York, Major,
that I wouldn't advise you to invade.
-Who will win the war?
-I haven't the slightest idea.
Rick is completely neutral about
everything.
lncluding women.
You were not aIways so carefully
neutral. we have a complete dossier.
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.
And why you left Paris.
Don't worry, we won't broadcast it.
Are my eyes really brown?
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine.
The point is an enemy of the Reich has
come to Casablanca...
...and we are checking up on anybody who
can be of any help to us.
My interest in victor Laszlo staying
or going is purely a sporting one.
ln this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?
Not particularly. I understand the
point of view of the hound too.
Victor Laszlo published the foulest
lies in the Prague newspapers.
Even after we marched in, he continued
the scandal sheets from a cellar.
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.
I admit he's very clever. 3 times he
slipped through our fingers.
ln Paris he continued
his activities.
We intend not to let
it happen again.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is
politics, mine is running a saloon.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
You see, Major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.
Perhaps.
-I reserved a table. victor Laszlo.
-Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. This way.
Two cointreaux, please.
I saw no one of Ugarte's
description.
Victor, I feel somehow
We shouldn't stay here.
lf we would walk out now it would
only call attention to us.
Perhaps Ugarte is in some
other part of the cafÃ©.
Excuse me, you look like a couple on
their way to America.
You'll find a market for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great loss.
-Thank you, but I don't think--
-Perhaps for the lady.
The ring is unique.
Yes, I'm very interested.
Good.
What is your name?
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.
I don't think we want to buy the ring,
but thank you for showing it to us.
-Such a bargain. You're sure?
-Yes. Sorry.
-Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
-Yes?
I am Captain Renault,
prÃ©fect of police.
Yes, what is it you want?
To welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.
lt isn't often we have so
distinguished a visitor.
Thank you.
Forgive me, Captain.
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.
May I present Miss llsa Lund.
I was informed you were the most
beautiful women to visit Casablanca.
That was a gross understatement.
You're very kind.
-Won't you join us?
-lf you'll permit me.
Emil, please. Your best champagne.
And put it on my bill.
lt's a game we play. They put it on the bill,
I tear it up. very convenient.
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano....
Somewhere I've seen him.
-Sam?
-Yes.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Who is he?
-You are in Rick's. Rick is--
-ls what?
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man,
if I were a woman...
...and I weren't around,
I should be in love with Rick.
But what a fool I am talking to
a beautiful woman about another man.
Excuse me.
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.
How do you do?
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are
a subject of the German Reich.
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.
I'd like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.
This is hardly the time or place.
Then shall we say tomorrow at 10 in
the prÃ©fect's office.
With Mademoiselle.
Captain, I am under your authority.
ls that your order?
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.
Very well.
A very clever tactical retreat,
Major.
-This time they really mean to stop me.
-Victor, I'm afraid for you.
We've been in difficult places
before, haven't we?
I must find out what Berger knows.
-Be careful.
-I will. Don't worry.
Mr. Berger,
could I see the ring again?
Champagne cocktail, please.
I recognize you from the news
photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
ln a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.
We read 5 times that you were killed
in 5 different places.
As you see, it was true every
single time.
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.
I'm looking for a man named Ugarte.
He's supposed to help me.
Ugarte cannot even help himseIf.
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.
I see.
But we who are still free will
do all we can. we are organized.
Underground, like everywhere else.
Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the CafÃ© du Roi.
lf you will come--
Will you ask the piano player to
come over here, please?
-How's the jewelry business, Berger?
-Not so good. Check, please.
Too bad you weren't here earlier.
We had a bit of excitement, right?
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.
-My bill.
-No. Two champagne cocktails.
-Hello, Sam.
-Hello, Miss llsa.
I never expected to see you again.
lt's been a long time.
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.
-Some of the old songs, Sam.
-Yes, ma'am.
Where is Rick?
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.
When will he be back?
Not tonight no more.
He went home.
Does he always leave so early?
He never--
He's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot.
Goes up there all the time.
You used to be
a much better liar, Sam.
Leave him alone, Miss llsa.
You're bad luck to him.
Play it once, Sam.
For old time's sake.
I don't know what you mean,
Miss llsa.
Play it, Sam.
Play "As Time Goes By."
I can't remember it, Miss llsa.
I'm a little rusty on it.
I'll hum it for you.
Sing it, Sam.
Sam, I thought I told you
never to play--
You were asking about Rick,
and here he is. May I present--
-Hello, llsa.
-Hello, Rick.
You've already met Rick?
Then perhaps you also know--
This is Mr. Laszlo.
-How do you do.
-How do you do.
One hears a great deal about
Rick in Casablanca.
And about victor Laszlo everywhere.
-Won't you join us for a drink?
-Rick never--
Thanks, I will.
Well, a precedent is being broken.
Emil.
lnteresting cafÃ©.
I congratulate you.
-I congratulate you.
-What for?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
We all try. You succeed.
She was asking about you earlier,
Rick, in a way that made me very jealous.
I wasn't sure you were the same.
-Let's see, the last time we met--
-Was La Belle Aurore.
How nice. You remembered.
But of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.
Not an easy day to forget.
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Yes. I put that dress away.
When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.
You're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have you to thank for that.
llsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.
So it is, and we have a curfew in
Casablanca. The chief of police...
...shouldn't be caught drinking
after hours.
-I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
-Not at all.
-Your check, sir.
-My party.
Another precedent gone. This has been
a very interesting evening.
I'll call you a cab.
-We'll come again.
-Anytime.
-Say good night to Sam for me.
-I will.
There's still nobody in the world who
plays "As time Goes By" like Sam.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
A puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.
-Tomorrow at 10.
-We'll be there.
Boss?
-Boss?
-Yeah?
-Ain't you going to bed?
-Not right now.
Ain't you going to bed
in the near future?
You ever going to bed?
I ain't sleepy, either.
Good, then have a drink.
-No, not me, boss.
-Well then, don't have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir.
I'm waiting for a lady.
Please, boss, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.
We'll take the car
and drive all night.
We'll get drunk, go fishing and stay
away until she's gone.
-Shut up and go home, will you?
-No, sir, I'm staying right here.
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.
That's the way it goes.
One in, one out.
-Sam.
-Yes, boss.
lf it's December, 1941 in Casablanca,
What time is it in New York?
What?
My watch stopped.
I bet they're asleep in New York.
I bet they're asleep all over America.
Of all the gin joints, in all the towns,
in all the world...
...she walks into mine.
-What's that you're playing?
-A little something of my own.
Well, stop it.
You know what I want to hear.
You played it for her.
You can play it for me.
-I don't remember--
-lf she can stand it, I can.
Play it.
Yes, boss.
Who are you really?
And what were you before?
What did you do,
and what did you think?
We said no questions.
Here's looking at you, kid.
A franc for your thoughts.
ln America they'd bring only a penny.
I guess that's all they're worth.
I'm willing to be overcharged.
Tell me.
Well, I was wondering....
Why I'm so lucky. why I should find
you waiting for me to come along.
Why there is no other man in my life?
That's easy.
There was.
He's dead.
I'm sorry for asking.
I forgot we said no questions.
Only one answer can take care
of all our questions.
Nothing can stop them now.
Wednesday, Thursday, they'll be in Paris.
Richard, with your record,
you won't be safe here.
I'm on their blacklist already.
Their roll of honor.
Henri wants us to finish this
bottle and three more.
He'll water his garden with champagne
before he lets the Germans drink it.
This should take the sting
out of being occupied, doesn't it?
You said it.
Here's looking at you, kid.
My German's a little rusty.
lt's the Gestapo.
They expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
They're telling us how to act
When they march in.
With the whole world crumbling,
We pick this time to fall in love.
lt's pretty bad timing.
Where were you 10 years ago?
10 years ago?
Let's see.
Yes, I was having a brace
put on my teeth. where were you?
Looking for a job.
Was that cannon fire?
Or is it my heart pounding?
lt's the German 77th, and judging by
the sound, about 35 miles away.
And getting closer every minute.
Here, here, drink up.
We'll never finish the other 3.
Them Germans will be here soon,
and they'll come looking for you.
Remember, there's a price on your head.
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.
lt's strange.
I know so very little about you.
I know little about you.
Except you had
your teeth straightened.
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.
No, we must leave.
Yes, of course. we.
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.
Not at my hotel. I...
...I have things to do in the city
before I leave.
I'll meet you at the station.
All right, at a quarter to 5.
Say, why don't we get married
in Marseilles?
That's too far ahead to plan.
Yes. I guess it is.
What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?
Why not?
The captain on a ship can.
What's wrong, kid?
I love you so much.
And I hate this war so much.
lt's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.
lf you shouldn't get away....
lf something should keep us apart...
...wherever they put you...
...and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that I....
Kiss me.
Kiss me as if
it were the last time.
Where is she?
Have you seen her?
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.
But this note came
just after you left.
That's the last call,
Mr. Richard.
Do you hear me?
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.
Rick, I have to talk to you.
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.
-No, Rick. Not tonight.
-Especially tonight.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca?
There are other places.
I wouldn't have come if I'd known you
Were here.
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.
Funny, your voice hasn't changed.
I can still hear it.
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.
We'll get on a train and never stop."
Don't, Rick.
I can understand how you feel.
You understand how I feel.
How long was it we had, honey?
-I didn't count the days.
-Well, I did.
Every one of them.
Mostly I remember the last one.
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a platform in the rain...
...with a comical look on his face...
...because his insides
have been kicked out.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Does it got a wild finish?
I don't know the finish yet.
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll
come to you as you go along.
lt's about a girl who had just come to
Paris from her home in Oslo.
At the house of some friends...
...she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.
A very great and courageous man.
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world full of...
...knowledge and thoughts and ideals.
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.
And she looked up to him and...
...worshiped him...
...with a feeling she supposed was love.
Yes, that's very pretty.
I heard a story once. ln fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano...
...playing in the parlor downstairs.
"Mister, I met a man once when I
Was a kid'" they'd always begin.
I guess neither of our stories
is very funny.
Tell me...
...who was it you left me for?
Was it Laszlo, or were there
others in between, or...
...aren't you the kind that tells?
I strongly suspect Ugarte left
the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.
I suggest you search
the cafÃ© immediately.
lf Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.
You give him credit for too much
cleverness.
My impression was that he's just
another blundering American.
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.
I was with them when they
blundered into Berlin in 191 8.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched 24
hours a day.
lt may interest you to know that at
this very moment he's on his way here.
There is nothing we can do.
I'm delightod to see you both.
Did you rest well?
I slept very well.
Strange, nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.
-May we proceed with the business?
-With pleasure. Sit down.
Very well, Laszlo,
We won't mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner
of the Reich.
So far you have been
fortunate in eluding us.
You have reached Casablanca.
lt is my duty to see that you
stay in Casablanca.
Whether or not you will
succeed is problematic.
Not at all. Renault's signature is
necessary on every visa.
Captain, is it possible Herr Laszlo
Will receive a visa?
I'm afraid not.
My regrets, sir.
Well, perhaps I shall
like it in Casablanca.
And Mademoiselle?
You needn't be concerned about me.
ls that all you wish to tell us?
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.
You may be in
Casablanca indefinitely.
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.
On one condition.
And that is?
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, Prague...
...Brussels, Amsterdam...
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens....
Even Berlin.
Yes, even Berlin.
lf you will furnish me with
their names and whereabouts...
...you'll have your visa
in the morning.
And the honor of having
served the Third Reich.
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.
That's honor enough for a lifetime.
You will give us the names?
lf I didn't give them to you in a
concentration camp...
...where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal...
...I certainly won't
give them to you now.
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?
What if you murdered all of us?
From every corner of Europe hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
You have a reputation for eloquence
Which I can now understand.
But you are mistaken.
You said enemies of the Reich
can be replaced.
But there is one exception.
No one could take your place
in the event anything unfortunate...
...should occur to you
While you were trying to escape.
You won't dare interfere
With me here.
This is still unoccupied France.
Any violation of neutrality
Would reflect on Captain Renault.
lnsofar as it is in my power.
By the way, last night you evinced
an interest in Ugarte.
I believe
you have a message for him?
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.
SeÃ±or Ugarte is dead.
I'm making the report now.
We haven't quite decided whether
he committed suicide, or...
...died trying to escape.
Are you quite finished with us?
For the time being.
Good day.
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.
Excuse me, Captain.
Another visa
problem has come up.
Show her in.
Sorry, we wouldn't be able
to handle the police.
This is a job for Ferrari.
lt can be most helpful to know Ferrari.
He practically has a monopoly
on the black market here.
You will find him
at the Blue Parrot.
Don't be too downhearted.
Perhaps you can come to terms
With Captain Renault.
Hello, Ferrari.
Good morning, Rick.
I see the bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.
No hurry, I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.
I never drink in the morning.
And every time you send my shipment
over, it's always a little bit short.
Carrying charges, my boy.
Here, sit down.
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Of course not. what upsets me
is the fact that Ugarte is dead...
...and no one knows where those
letters of transit are.
Practically no one.
lf I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.
I have a proposition for whoever
has those letters.
I'll handle the entire transaction.
Get rid of the letters, take
all the risk for a small percentage.
And the carrying charges?
Naturally there would be a few
incidental expenses.
That's the proposition I have
for whoever has those letters.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
I'll put my cards on the table.
I think you know where they are.
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.
That's why I came over here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.
Excuse me,
I'll be getting back.
-Morning.
-Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
You won't find a treasure like this
in all Morocco.
Only 700 francs.
You're being cheated.
lt doesn't matter, thank you.
For friends of Rick's we have
a small discount.
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to
receive you when you called last night.
lt doesn't matter.
Special friends of Rick's
get a special discount.
100 francs.
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.
I have some tablecloths,
some napkins--
Thank you.
I'm really not interested.
Did you come back to tell me why you ran
out on me at the railway station?
Yes.
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Why not? I got stuck with the ticket.
I think I'm entitled to know.
Last night I saw
What has happened to you.
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.
But the one who looked at me
With such hatred....
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon
and we'll never see each other again.
We knew very little about each other
When we were in love in Paris.
lf we leave it that way, maybe we'll
remember those days and not Casablanca.
Not last night.
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?
You can believe that if you want to.
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.
Above a saloon, it's true, but...
...walk up a flight...
...I'll be expecting you.
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.
You'll be there.
No, Rick.
No. You see, victor Laszlo
is my husband.
And was...
even when I knew you in Paris.
I was just telling Mr. Laszlo that
unfortunately I'm not able to help him.
You see, my dear,
Word has got around.
As leader of all illegal activities,
I'm an influential and respected man.
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Mr. Laszlo.
You, however,
are a different matter.
Ferrari thinks it might just be possible
to get an exit visa for you.
You mean for me to go on alone?
And only alone.
I'll stay here and keep trying.
I'm sure in a little while--
Might as well be frank.
lt would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.
We are only interested in two visas.
Please, llsa, don't be hasty.
You two will want to discuss this.
Excuse me.
I'll be at the bar.
No, llsa.
I won't let you stay here.
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.
But, victor, if the situation
Were different...
...if I had to stay and there
Were only one visa...
...would you take it?
Yes, I would.
Yes, I see.
When I had trouble
getting out of Lille...
...why didn't you leave me there?
When I was sick in Marseilles for two
Weeks and you were in danger...
...why didn't you leave me then?
I meant to.
Something always held me up.
I love you very much, llsa.
Your secret will be safe with me.
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.
We've decided.
For the present we will look
for two visas. Thank you very much.
Good luck, but be careful.
-You know you're being shadowed?
-Of course. lt becomes an instinct.
I observe that you in one respect
are a very fortunate man.
I am moved to make a suggestion.
Why, I do not know.
Because it cannot possibly profit me.
But have you heard of Ugarte
and the letters of transit?
Yes, something.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
When they arrested him.
You know where they are?
Not for sure, Monsieur.
But my guess is that Ugarte
left those letters with Mr. Rick.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.
But it is worth a chance.
Thank you very much.
Good day.
Goodbye, and thank you
for your coffee.
I shall miss it when we leave.
lt was gracious of you
to share it with me.
-Here's to you, sir.
-Good luck.
-I'd better be going.
-Check, please.
I have to warn you, sir.
This is a dangerous place
full of vultures.
-Vultures everywhere. Thank you.
-Goodbye.
lt has been a pleasure to meet you.
You are getting to be
your best customer.
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.
Now you're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.
That's some going-over your men
gave my place this afternoon.
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.
I told Strasser
he wouldn't find the letters.
But I told my men
to be very destructive.
You know how
that impresses Germans.
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?
Louis, are you Pro-vichy
or Free French?
Serves me right for asking
a direct question. Subject is closed.
lt looks like
you're a little late.
So Yvonne's gone
over to the enemy.
Who knows. She may constitute
an entire second front.
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I'll see you later.
Sascha!
French 75.
Put up a row of them.
Starting here and ending here.
We will begin with two.
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?
What I said
is none of your business.
I'll make it my business.
I don't like disturbances in my place,
so either lay off politics or get out.
You see, Captain?
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.
Major, we are trying to cooperate
With your government.
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.
Are you certain which side you're on?
I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.
I blow with the wind...
...and the prevailing wind
happens to be from vichy.
And if it should change?
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?
We are concerned about more
than Casablanca.
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.
Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps...
-...for a leader.
-A leader? Like Laszlo?
I have been thinking.
lt is too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.
I see what you mean.
Thank you, Carl.
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
I thought you would ask me,
so I brought the good brandy...
...and the dress glass.
At last the day's came!
We are speaking nothing
but English now.
So we should feel at home
When we get to America.
A very nice idea.
To America!
What watch?
10 watch.
Such much?
You will get along
beautifully in America.
How is lady luck treating you?
Oh, too bad.
You'll find him over there.
Could I speak to you a moment, please?
How'd you get in here?
You're under age.
-I came with Captain Renault.
-I should have known.
My husband is with me too.
He is? Captain Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.
Have a drink?
No, of course not.
Mind if I do?
Mr. Rick...
...what kind of a man
is Captain Renault?
Like any other man,
only more so.
No, I mean...
...is he trustworthy?
ls his word--
Just a minute.
Who told you to ask me that?
He did.
I thought so.
Where's your husband?
At the roulette table, trying to win
enough for our exit visas.
Oh, of course he's losing.
How long have you been married?
8 weeks.
We come from Bulgaria.
Things are very bad there.
The devil has the people
by the throat.
So, Jan and I, we...
...we do not want our children
to grow up in such a country.
So you decided to go to America.
But we haven't much money, and...
...traveling is so expensive
and difficult.
lt was more than we thought
to get here.
And then Captain Renault sees us...
...and he is so kind,
he wants to help us.
Yes, I'll bet.
He tells me he can give us
an exit visa.
But we have no money.
-Does he know that?
-Yes.
And he's still willing
to give you a visa?
And you want to know....
Will he keep his word?
He always has.
You are a man.
lf someone loved you very much...
...so that your happiness was the only
thing she wantod in the world...
...and she did a bad thing to make
certain of it...
...could you forgive her?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...
...that would be all right,
Wouldn't it?
-You want my advice?
-Yes, please.
Go back to Bulgaria.
But if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America.
Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.
ln many ways
I am so much older than he is.
Yes, well, everybody
in Casablanca has problems.
Yours may work out.
You'll excuse me.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
You see?
Here we are again.
I'll take that
as a great compliment to Sam.
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.
He does.
Could we have a table close to him?
And far away from Strasser
as possible.
The geography may be a little
difficult to arrange.
This way, please.
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favorite tune.
Thank you.
Two cognacs, please.
Do you wish to place
another bet, sir?
I guess not.
Have you tried 22?
I said 22.
Leave it there.
Cash it in and don't come back.
Are you sure this place is honest?
Honest? As honest as the day is long.
How are we doing tonight?
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.
He's just a lucky guy.
Mr. Rick,
may I get you a cup of coffee?
No thanks, Carl.
-Captain Renault, may I--
-Oh, not here, please.
Come to my office in the morning.
We'll do everything businesslike.
-We'll be there at 6.
-I'll be there at 10.
I'm happy for both of you.
Still, it's very strange
that you won.
Well, maybe not so strange.
-I'll see you in the morning.
-Thank you, Captain Renault.
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.
Go away, you crazy Russian.
As I suspectod.
You're a rank sentimentalist.
Why do you interfere
With my little romances?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Well, I'll forgive you this time.
But I'll be in tomorrow night
With a breathtaking blonde.
And it'll make me
Very happy if she loses.
Mr. Blaine,
I wonder if I could talk to you?
-Go ahead.
-lsn't there some other place?
lt's rather confidential,
What I have to say.
ln my office.
You must know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.
lt's my privilege to be
one of the leaders of a great movement.
You know what I've been doing.
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...
...that I am free to reach America
and continue my work.
I'm not interested in politics.
The problems of the world
are not in my department.
I'm a saloonkeeper.
My friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record.
You ran guns to Ethiopia.
You fought against
the Fascists in Spain.
What of it?
lsn't it strange you always seem
to be fighting with the underdog?
Yes, I found that
a very expensive hobby.
But then I never was
much of a businessman.
Are you enough of a businessman to
appreciate an offer of 100'000 francs?
I appreciate it,
but I don't accept it.
I'll raise it to 200'000.
My friend, you could make it a million
francs or 3.
My answer would still be the same.
There must be some reason
Why you won't let me have them.
There is.
I suggest that you ask your wife.
-I beg your pardon?
-I said, ask your wife.
-My wife?
-Yes.
Play "La Marseillaise"!
Play it!
See? lf Laszlo's presence in a cafÃ©
can inspire this demonstration...
...what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?
I advise this place be shut up at once.
-Everybody's having a good time.
-Yes, much too good a time.
The place is to be closed.
-But I have no excuse to close it.
-Find one.
Everybody is to leave immediately.
This cafÃ© is closed
until further notice.
Clear the room at once.
How can you close me up?
On what grounds?
I'm shocked to find that gambling
is going on in here.
-Your winnings, sir.
-Thank you.
Everybody out at once.
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
This morning it wasn't safe
for him to leave Casablanca.
That is also true.
Except to return to Occupied France.
-Occupied France?
-Under safe conduct from me.
Of what value is that?
You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.
There are only
two other alternatives for him.
The French authorities may find a reason
to put him in concentration camp here.
The other alternative?
Perhaps you have already observed
that in Casablanca human life is cheap.
Good night.
-What happened with Rick?
-We'll discuss it later.
Our faithful friend is still there.
Victor, please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.
I must.
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.
Don't joke. After Major Strassers
Warning tonight, I'm frightened.
To tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?
Or carry on the best I can?
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.
Victor, why don't you tell me about
Rick? what did you find out?
Apparently he has the letters.
But no intention of selling them.
One would think if sentiment
Wouldn't persuade him, money would.
Did he give you any reason?
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."
I don't know why he said that.
Well, our friend outside will think
We've retired by now.
I'll be going in a few minutes.
When I was in the concentration camp...
...were you lonely in Paris?
Yes, victor, I was.
I know how it is to be lonely.
ls there anything you wish to tell me?
No, victor, there isn't.
I love you very much, my dear.
Yes, I know.
Victor, whatever I do,
Will you believe that I--
You don't have to say it.
I'll believe.
Good night, dear.
Good night.
Yes, dear?
Be careful.
Of course, I'll be careful.
Well, you are in pretty good shape.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Two weeks, maybe three.
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.
ln the meantime
everybody stays on salary.
Thank you, Herr Rick.
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.
You finish locking up,
Will you, Carl?
-Then I am going to the meeting of--
-Don't tell me where you're going.
I won't.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Rick.
How did you get in?
The stairs from the street.
I told you this morning you'd come
around, but this is a little early.
Won't you sit down?
-Richard, I had to see you.
-"Richard!" we're back in Paris.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected
by chance with the letters of transit?
lt seems that with those letters
I'll never be lonely.
You can ask any price,
but I must have those letters.
I went all through that
With your husband. lt's no deal.
I know how you feel about me,
but I'm asking you...
...to put your feelings aside
for something more important.
Do I have to hear again
What a great man your husband is...
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?
lt was your cause too.
ln your own way you were fighting
for the same thing.
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myseIf.
I'm the only cause
I'm interested in.
We loved each other once.
lf those days
meant anything at all to you--
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
lt's poor salesmanship.
Please listen. lf you knew what really
happened. lf you only knew the truth.
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you told me.
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.
You want to feel sorry for yourseIf,
don't you?
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.
One woman has hurt you, and you
take revenge on the rest of world.
You're a coward and a weakling.
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but you...
...you are our last hope.
lf you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
What of it?
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
lt's a good spot for it.
Now, if you'll--
All right.
I tried to reason with you.
I tried everything.
Now I want those letters.
Get them for me.
I don't have to.
I got them right here.
Put them on the table.
No.
For the last time,
put them on the table.
lf Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.
I tried to stay away.
I thought I would never see you again.
That you were out of my life.
The day you left Paris...
...if you knew what I went through.
lf you knew how much I loved you.
How much I still love you.
And then?
lt wasn't long after we were married
that victor went back to Czechoslovakia.
They needed him in Prague.
But the Gestapo were waiting for him.
Just 2 lines in the paper:
"victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.
Then it came.
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.
Then I met you.
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
lt wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.
lf the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me and...
...for those working with us.
And when did you first find out
he was alive?
Just before you and I
Were to leave Paris together.
A friend came and told me
that victor was alive.
They were hiding him in a freight car
in the outskirts of Paris.
He was sick. He needed me.
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.
Well...
...now you know the rest.
Well, it's still a story
Without an ending.
What about now?
Now?
I don't know.
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.
And Laszlo?
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.
All except one.
He won't have you.
I can't fight it anymore.
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.
Oh, I don't know
What's right any longer.
You have to think for both of us.
For all of us.
All right.
I will.
Here's looking at you, kid.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
-I think we lost them.
-Yes.
I'm afraid they caught
some of the others.
Come inside.
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you.
Carl, what happened?
The police break up our meeting, Rick.
We escaped at the last moment.
-Come up here a minute.
-Yes, I come.
I want you to turn out the rear entrance
light. lt might attract the police.
-But Sascha aIways puts out that light.
-Tonight he forgot.
Yes, I come. I will do it.
I want you to take
Miss Lund home.
lt's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.
This might come in handy.
Thank you.
Had a close one?
Yes, rather.
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?
I mean, what you're fighting for.
We might as well question
Why we breathe.
lf we stop breathing, we'll die.
lf we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.
You know how you sound,
Mr. Blaine?
Like a man trying to convince himself
of something he doesn't believe.
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.
-I get the point.
-I wonder if you do.
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself.
And that you'll never succeed.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.
I know, for instance,
that you're in love with a woman.
lt's perhaps a strange circumstance...
...that we both should be in love
With the same woman.
The first evening
I came into this cafÃ©...
...I knew there was something
between you and llsa.
Since no one is to blame...
...I demand no explanation.
I ask only one thing: You won't give
me the letters of transit...
...all right.
But I want my wife to be safe.
I ask you as a favor...
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.
You love her that much?
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.
I am also a human being.
Yes, I love her that much.
-Mr. Laszlo?
-Yes?
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.
On what charge?
Captain Renault will discuss that
With you later.
lt seems that destiny
has taken a hand.
You have no proof and you know it.
This isn't Germany or Occupied France.
All you can do is fine him a few
thousand francs and give him 30 days.
You might as well let him go now.
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.
lf you were to help him escape--
What makes you think I'd stick
my neck out for Laszlo?
Because, one,
you bet 10'000 francs he'd escape.
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Now, don't bother to deny it.
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strassers looks.
As a matter of fact,
I don't like them either.
They're all excellent reasons.
Don't count too much
on my friendship, Ricky.
ln this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose 10'000 francs.
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.
Yes, I have the letters.
But I intend using them myseIf.
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.
-What friend?
-llsa Lund.
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.
The last man I want to see in America.
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.
You can fill in your names
and leave anytime you please.
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to llsa and me.
We have a legal right to go, it's
true, but people have been held here...
...in spite of their legal rights.
What makes you think
We want to hold you?
llsa is Laszlo's wife.
She probably knows things
Strasser would like to know.
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.
lf instead of this petty charge
you have against him...
...you could get something big...
...something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...
...that would be a feather in your cap,
Wouldn't it?
lt certainly would. Germany,
eh, vichy, would be very grateful.
Then, release him.
You be at my place a
half-hour before the plane leaves.
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters of transit...
...and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.
You get him and we get away.
To the Germans, that last
Will be just a minor annoyance.
There's still something about
this business I don't understand.
Miss Lund is beautiful, yes...
...but you were never interested
in any woman.
She isn't just any woman.
I see.
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?
I'll make the arrangements right now
With Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
I'll miss you. You're the only one
in Casablanca with less scruples than I.
Oh, thanks.
Go ahead, Ricky.
Call off your watchdogs when you let
him go. I don't want them around.
I'm taking no chances,
not even with you.
Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?
Cortainly not good enough. But since
I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
To get out of Casablanca and to America.
You're a lucky man.
By the way, my agreement with Sam is he
always gets 25 percent of the profits.
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.
abdul, Carl and Sascha stay with
the place or I don't sell.
Of course they stay.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
So long.
And don't forget you owe Rick's
100 carton of American cigarettes.
I shall remember to
pay it to myself.
-You're late.
-I was informed as Laszlo was leaving...
...the hotel, so I'm on time.
-I thought I said no watchdogs.
-He won't be followed here.
You know this place will never be
the same without you.
I know what you mean.
I've spoken to Ferrari.
You'll still win at roulette.
ls everything ready?
I have the letters here.
Tell me, when we searched the place,
Where were they?
Sam's piano.
Serves me right
for not being musical.
Here they are.
You better wait in my office.
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?
-No, not yet.
-But is everything all right?
Everything is quite all right.
We'll tell him at the airport. The less
time to think, the easier.
Please trust me.
Yes, I will.
-I don't know how to thank you.
-Save it, we still have a lot to do.
-I brought the money.
-Keep it, you'll need it in America.
-But we made a deal--
-Never mind that.
You won't have any trouble in Lisbon,
Will you?
No. That's all arranged.
Good, I've got the letters
made out in blank...
...all you have to do is fill
in the signatures.
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.
On the charge of accessory
to the murder of the couriers...
...from whom these letters were stolen.
You're surprised at my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue.
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
-Have you taken leave of your senses?
-I have. Sit down.
I wouldn't like to shoot you,
but I will if you take one more step.
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.
-Keep your hands on the table.
-I suppose you know what you're doing...
...but I wonder if you realize
What this means?
I do. we've got plenty of time
to discuss that later.
Call off your watchdogs, you said.
Call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.
And remember, this gun
is pointed right at your heart.
That is my least vulnerable spot.
ls that the airport?
This is Captain Renault speaking.
There'll be 2 letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.
There's to be no trouble about them.
Good.
Hello?
My car, quickly!
This is Major Strasser.
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.
At once, do you hear?
Hello, radio tower?
Lisbon plane taking off in ten minutes,
east runway.
Visibility one and one half miles.
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.
Coiling unlimited. Thank you.
Louis, have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.
Cortainly, Rick, anything you say.
Find Mr. Laszlo's luggage
and put it on the plane.
This way, please.
lf you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it even more official.
You think of everything, don't you?
And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. victor Laszlo.
But why my name, Richard?
Because you're getting on that plane.
But I don't understand,
What about you?
I'm staying here with him
until the plane gets safely away.
No, Richard. what has happened to you?
Last night you said--
Last night we said a great many things.
You said I was to do the thinking
for both of us.
I've done a lot of it since then.
lt all adds up to one thing:
You're getting on that plane with victor
Where you belong.
Now you've got to listen to me.
Do you have any idea what you'd have
to look forward to here?
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?
I'm afraid Major Strasser
Would insist.
You're saying this only
to make me go.
I'm saying it because it's true.
lnside we both know
you belong with victor.
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.
lf that plane leaves the ground and
you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon. And for the rest of your life.
But what about us?
We'll always have Paris.
We didn't have. we'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.
We got it back last night.
When I said I would never leave you.
And you never will.
But I have a job too.
And where I'm going, you can't follow.
What I've got to do...
...you can't be any part of.
llsa, I'm no good at being noble.
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of 3 little people...
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.
Someday you'll understand that.
Here's looking at you, kid.
-Everything is in order.
-All except one thing.
There's something you should know
before you leave.
I don't ask you
to explain anything.
lt may make a difference to you
later on.
You said you knew about llsa and me.
But you didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.
She came for the letters of transit.
Right, llsa?
She tried everything to get them,
and nothing worked.
She did her best to convince me
she was still in love with me.
But that was all over long ago.
For your sake she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.
I understand.
-Here it is.
-Thanks.
I appreciate it.
Welcome back to the fight.
This time I know our side will win.
Are you ready, llsa?
Yes, I'm ready.
Goodbye, Rick.
God bless you.
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.
Well, I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.
Stay where you are.
I don't know
What you're talking about.
What you did for Laszlo.
And that fairy tale you invented
to send llsa away with him.
I know a little about women.
She went.
But she knew you were lying.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
I suppose you know this isn't going
to be pleasant for either of us.
Especially for you.
I'll have to arrest you.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
What was the meaning
of that phone call?
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?
Ask Mr. Rick.
Get away from that phone.
I would advise you not
to interfere.
I was willing to shoot Renault.
I'll shoot you.
-Put that phone down!
-Get me the radio tower.
Put it down!
Major Strasser has been shot.
Round up the usual suspects.
Well, you're not only a sentimentalist,
but you've become a patriot.
Maybe. lt seemed like
a good time to start.
Perhaps you're right.
lt might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while.
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.
I could arrange passage.
My letter of transit?
I could use a trip.
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10'000 francs.
That 10'000 francs
should pay our expenses.
"Our" expenses?
Louis...
...I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
