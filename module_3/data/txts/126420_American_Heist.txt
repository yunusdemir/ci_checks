Come on, come on,
come on.
Francis Kelly!
Hey, Frankie!
Here you go.
That's everything.
Yeah, that's my brother.
Hey, Frankie.
Frankie, see you
in a couple months.
Yeah, I'll pay your mom
a visit in the meantime.
I'm a free motherfucker.
- Ha, ha.
- I'm a free motherfucker.
I'm a free motherfucker.
- What up, Frankie?
- What up, Sugar?
Yeah, I'm a free motherfucker.
Oh, shit.
You got my hat.
Yeah, Frankie's back, baby.
Frankie's back.
- Frankie's back.
- What up?
Come on, Frankie.
Come on, boy. You good.
Watch your head, bro.
All night, brother.
Fuck, dude. I'm good.
Yeah.
Oh, shit.
Oh, Ray, man.
Oh, this is your place, bro?
Oh, man.
Yo, dude, this fucking girl,
man, tonight...
bro, man, this fucking pussy
was like-
- Bro, what-
- Where's his brother?
Can somebody get that?
James, grab the phone!
Lewis' Auto.
Yeah, I'm James Kelly.
Yeah, well, I thought
it was your mandate or whatever...
to support
small business with loans.
Yeah, no, I understand.
Nah, man,
I don't have a degree.
I don't really see
how that matters much.
Yeah.
Yeah, all right.
All right, all right.
Thanks for your time, man.
Yeah. No, thanks for your time.
Asshole.
Fuck.
Hey, hey, Joe!
I got this one.
Your number one
news station in New Orleans.
Emily.
James Kelly.
Wow.
I thought you moved away
after Katrina.
I did, but, um, soon
as I could get work, I came back.
Oh, yeah?
What do you do?
I'm a dispatcher
for the NOPD.
Really?
What? So you're like
a cop or something?
No, I'm not a cop. I'm a-
I'm a glorified operator.
That's cool.
You kind of disappeared.
Yeah, yeah.
No, I know. I, uh...
I went traveling.
I was traveling abroad
for a little bit, you know.
Really? 'Cause I thought
maybe you got abducted by aliens...
or started working for the CIA or,
I don't know, went to prison.
Actually, yes.
I used to be a secret agent
for the CIA.
- Oh, wow.
- But on very top secret missions.
But that was
a long time ago...
and I don't want
to talk about it anymore.
Come here for a second.
- You live nearby?
- Not far.
- Got a garage at your place?
- Sure.
Look, this, uh...
this shop, it's,
you know, too high-priced.
If you want...
I could just fix
your car at your place...
and you don't got
to pay me for my time.
I'll just- I'll pass along
new parts at cost...
and I'll save you
a couple bucks.
That's- that is
very sweet of you.
Least I could do.
So this guy goes to prison...
and they lock him down in a cell.
Two-man room.
He looks in and he sees
there's a big 350-pound black guy...
just sitting there
mean-mugging him.
Black guy says...
"Say, man.
You want to be the mama
or you want to be the daddy?"
The guy says,
"Excuse me?"
He said,
"Did I stu- stu- stutter, motherfucker?
I say, 'You want to be the mama
or you want to be the daddy?"'
Guy says, "Well...
I'll be the daddy. "
He said, "Fine. You the daddy.
Come over here
and suck on mama's dick. "
Aw, come on, Jim.
Come on, man.
It's been 10 years.
You can do better
than that, no?
You got some fucking balls
showing up here, man.
What's the matter, Jimmy?
I came to see you.
You didn't come to see me.
Whatever happened
to me and you against the world, huh?
- You want to know what happened, Frankie?
- Yeah, what happened?
- You want to know what happened?
- Yeah, what happened?
Yeah? I'll tell you what happened.
You fucking turned
the world against me.
You still crying about that? Huh?
That's life, buddy.
Shit ain't fair.
Oh, fuck!
Hey, all right,
all right, all right!
Don't act crazy, come on.
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Ah, shit, Jimmy.
Shit, Frankie.
Let's go get a drink, huh?
Come on,
let's go grab a drink.
I can't tonight.
Tomorrow.
- You're prompt.
- I like to keep my appointments.
Not what I recall.
What happened to your eye?
- Oh, it was just a-
- You know what? I-
All good,
it's not my business.
So I'm guessing
you have tools?
Yeah, yeah. In my car.
- Uh, you got the keys?
- Yeah.
It's very sweet of you
to do this. Really.
Yeah, I-
I think I owe you.
It was a long time ago, James.
- I'll be inside if you need me.
- All right.
How's it going out there?
Well, it looks like someone
put sugar in your gas tank.
- You're kidding.
- No.
Probably just some bored kids.
You park in bad neighborhoods?
I won't ever again.
Can you fix it?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
It's fixable, it's just-
it was gummed up pretty bad, so I'm
going to have to replace the fuel filter...
but we got a bunch of those
kicking around the shop...
and clean out your gas tank,
which will take me a bit of time.
But the worst part is you're going
to need a new carburetor, so...
I'm going to go back
and order one of those tonight.
Guess I'll see you tomorrow, then.
Guess so.
All right, well,
I'm going to go lock up.
- You have yourself a good night.
- Okay, you, too.
Mr. Kelly, I'm afraid there's been
a misunderstanding.
This is not the type of loan
that's attractive to us right now.
Well, if you could just-
if you could just look at what I got here...
you know, you might find it
a little interesting.
All right, I've done the research...
and, you know, look,
the area needs another auto shop.
All right? Here, look.
This is my location right here.
There's like 10,000 cars
that go around this circle.
It's a prime spot.
I mean, it makes perfect sense.
Here, look. This is it right here,
and it's just sitting there empty.
I'm not looking
for that much cash.
Just enough to cover the rent
for seven, eight months...
and then I'll start turning a profit.
And my business plan-
my business plan...
it's- it's good, all right?
You just got to take a look at it,
but I promise you-
Frankly, Mr. Kelly...
we don't make
small business loans anymore.
All right.
Well, what the hell
do you guys do?
You know what?
Never mind, all right?
I'm sorry.
It's just you're Johnny-on-the-spot
with those overdraft fees.
Yo.
I can't believe this place
is still in business, man.
Come here, come here.
Yo, let me get another Jameson's.
Two. Two,
for me and my brother.
My brother, huh?
How you been, Jimmy?
It's James now, all right?
People don't call me Jimmy no more.
Okay, James.
You all grown up now?
Look, I know you're upset.
You got a right to be.
It's just, I figured
all this time, you know?
Yeah? What did you figure, Frankie?
What did you figure, huh, man?
You'd come back and what?
I went to jail, Frankie.
Bro, you got off easy
with 16 months.
I did 10 years.
Every day I was in there...
every fucking day, Jimmy,
I thought about you, man.
I'm sorry, man.
I want to make amends.
- It's not so easy, Frankie.
- I know, I know.
I know.
Jimmy, I'm so proud
of you, bro. Really.
I'm proud of you, man.
You're a fucking good-looking kid, man.
I mean, I don't know who Mom fucked,
but you lucked out.
You know how much
I bragged about you, man?
Like every fucking cat
in D block knew about you...
blowing up
these al-Qaeda niggas, man.
Everybody, dude.
You know what kind of street cred I got...
for having a brother
who knows how to blow shit up?
- Yeah, well-
- Come on.
The world forgets fast, Frankie.
So we'll make them remember.
I got a solution.
You got a solution?
Frankie, I've changed, all right?
- Jimmy, I've changed.
- Yeah, you've changed.
Yeah, I've done
a lot of soul-searching.
Really, I'm like- I'm like-
I'm like Buddha and shit.
Believe me.
I've had time to think.
Okay?
A lot of suckers in there, man.
That ain't us.
Okay? I'm going
to make things right.
We just got a bad hand.
Yeah, you think so?
Jimmy...
I know two guys, right?
They're good guys.
They looked out
for me in the joint.
- They really did.
- Yeah, what about them?
We all want the same things.
To overcome the obstacles.
Frankie, I'm not doing nothing shady.
You call real estate shady?
- Real estate?
- Yeah.
Real estate.
What, you get yourself
a fucking real estate license in the pen?
Fuck you, man.
I ain't trying to be a fucking agent, bro.
- Yeah.
- I ain't a fucking agent.
I'm a boss,
you know what I'm saying?
- A boss. Legit.
- Hmm.
Calling the shots, cashing the checks.
What, hollering, what?
In that cheap suit?
Fuck you, bro.
Fuck you, man.
Yeah, well, fuck you, bro.
Come on, man.
I want to look out for you.
- Yeah.
- Like the old days.
Me and you
against the world, remember?
Let's go flip some houses, bro.
I got the hookup, man.
They're giving them away.
We fix and flip, fix and flip.
It's easy.
All right, well, where
you getting the cash from?
Investor.
We got an investor.
He's going to take a big piece at first,
but it'll be all right.
Come on.
I want you to meet my boys.
They're outside.
What? Now?
Somebody had
to give me a ride.
You have some money on you?
Oh, shit. Yo.
Yo, this is my brother Jim-
I mean James.
This is Ray.
This is Sugar.
Hey, man.
How's it going?
- Hey, man.
- How's it going, buddy?
Sugar.
Sugar, Ray.
Where's Leonard?
That shit's funny, though.
We heard a lot about you, man.
Yo, so, like, James
has some questions about the investor...
and, you know, how the deal
is going to go down, all that shit.
- As he should.
- I don't know if Frankie's told you...
but I don't have any cash
or nothing like that.
- Look, man, who does?
- No, we don't want your money, man.
I'm putting together
a team of people that I can trust.
We have a meeting tonight.
Give us a lift,
I'll tell you more.
- You want me to drive?
- Yeah.
I thou- I thought you gave
my bro a ride here.
Oh, yeah, we drove.
We got a car, but it's small.
I don't like small, man.
I don't like small at all.
- Unless it's pussy, though.
- Unless it's pussy.
- Come on.
- All right.
- Let's take a ride.
- All right, come on.
So you did all the work
on this yourself, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, I did all the bodywork
over the last couple months.
I just got her running
a few weeks ago.
Good with cars.
It's good to know.
- Yeah, I'm not bad.
- This kid's the best, man.
He can fix them,
he can build them, he can race them.
He's too humble.
I also hear you did some time.
Yeah, Frankie told you
about that?
- Yeah, Jimmy.
- Yeah, what can I say? I was stupid.
Hey, happens to the best of us.
Yeah, I guess so.
Pull in right over there, Jimmy.
- Who works this late?
- Who asks so many questions?
Our investor owns the place.
We won't be long.
20 minutes tops.
Hey, when we get back...
your ass better be right here,
you hear me?
Frankie.
Hey, Frankie.
- What? What?
- I got a bad feeling about this.
Jimmy, come on, man,
the guy's got a red-eye to London.
If we don't do it now,
we lose our shot.
It's good.
It's good.
Come on, come on,
come on.
- Oh, shit. Get in the car.
- What the fuck?
What you doing?
Back in the fucking car!
Go, go, go.
When I say stay in the car,
you stay in the fucking car!
Drive!
- Oh, shit!
- Go!
You blew the fucking guy
away for no reason, man.
- What the fuck?
- Relax. Relax, man.
You shot that motherfucker
for nothing.
- Shut the fuck up!
- This is fucked, bro.
Be more like your brother, Frankie.
- Yeah.
- Cool.
Cool. All right.
We're fucking cool, man.
You're complicit in this.
Welcome to the family.
Get rid of this car.
Aw, man, I don't think
there's any way he saw my plate.
- Just get rid of it.
- Fuck.
You understand me, Jimmy?
Look at me.
You understand me?
Yeah, we're good.
You kept your head.
Usually do.
Don't worry about the car, Jimmy.
You can always jack
another one.
Man.
I'm sorry.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck!
Yo, Jimmy.
Jimmy, man.
Come on.
- What the fuck, man?
- Real estate, huh, motherfucker?
Yo, yo, man.
Watch the suit, man. Come on.
You didn't get rid of the fucking car, man.
That's a problem.
How could you do this to me,
Frankie, huh?
I'm your fucking brother, man.
What, what?
It's not my fault, man.
- It's not my fault.
- You know I'm fucking-
I'm this close to putting
it all behind me.
I'm fucking this close.
You fucking screwed me again!
I didn't know they were going
to do that shit. Come on.
The second I saw those two,
I knew they were trouble.
Like, what the fuck is the matter with you?
Open your fucking eyes.
I talked to them.
There's not going to be any more problems.
Oh, yeah?
No more problems?
You're so fucking casual
about everything.
- I'm not casual.
- No, seriously.
You got a fucking screw loose, man.
- Nah, nah.
- All right?
You're fucked, all right?
Jimmy, man. Come on,
you can't go anywhere right now.
Where you going?
Come on, you can't leave.
Yeah, no more problems?
- Fuck you, Frankie.
- Yo, for real, man.
You can't do this.
- You can't do it.
- You're my brother, all right?
You're supposed
to look out for me.
- I am, I am.
- Yeah? You are?
- Fuck you.
- No, Jimmy, man. Really, you can't.
No? Watch me.
'Cause I'm leaving.
No, Jimmy.
Jimmy, really.
Jimmy, for real. Jimmy.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.
They can't know you're running.
They can't think you're running on them.
Give me that shit. Come on.
Hey, what up?
What up?
- Taking a trip?
- Huh?
Oh, no, James loaned
me some shit...
'cause I ain't got no shit.
You know, to wear.
Aren't you supposed
to get rid of that?
I was just about to do that.
Hey, Jimmy, why don't you
hand Sugar your keys?
He'll take care of it for you.
Yeah, you do that.
Come on, man.
You heard him, give me the keys.
Fucking amateurs.
Sorry, Jimmy.
It's a nice car.
I'm sorry.
You know, I'm having a conversation.
Want to take this inside?
No, I'm good here.
It's your house.
Frankie says you need money.
Oh, yeah?
Did he say that?
You need money, right?
Tell him about the bank.
Come on, tell him about the bank.
What bank?
Yo, I'm not robbing no banks
with you guys, all right?
Not happening.
Take a look around, kid.
What do you see?
Homes being foreclosed.
People working two, three jobs
just to put food on the table...
and still drowning in debt.
Don't get me wrong.
This country was founded
on great ideals and principles.
But they've all been ruined
by the banks.
Open your eyes, Jimmy.
It's the banks that are robbing you.
Word the fuck up, man.
You know who
my favorite president was?
Who?
Thomas Jefferson.
Because he saw all of this coming
and tried to stop it.
He fought the banks.
J FK, too,
and they killed him for it.
Fucked up, man.
It's fucked up.
"The banking institution
is more dangerous than an army," he said.
He also said that every generation
needs a revolution, Jimmy.
The American dream
is just that...
just a fucking dream.
Deep.
That's deep.
Frankie, go start the car
and turn on the AC.
It's too hot in this city.
It's nice out, bro.
Jimmy, man. Come on.
I'll be in touch.
Get some sleep, Jimmy.
But no sleepwalking.
Any problems you cause
will be very bad for your brother.
Aw, Frankie.
You fucking motherfucker.
You fucking mother-
You motherfucker.
Jimmy.
Ah, Jimmy.
Come on, you done
calling dinosaurs?
That's disgusting, man.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.
Sug, what's up, Sug?
- Hey.
- Hello.
Oh, shit, look.
They got all this whipped cream and shit.
Yo, House.
Come here, man.
This is my brother, James.
- He's driving and blowing shit up.
- Don't fuck this up.
You need to eat something, dude.
- What?
- What? Nothing.
That's like House's crew.
He's cool, he's cool.
I don't talk
to them too much.
- We still-
- Yeah, we're cool.
- Ah, fellas, what's up?
- Oh, shit.
- You remember Spoonie?
- Spoonie?
- From back in the day.
- We used to play ball together, man.
- Yo, Spoonie from the Bywater-
- Boys, gather 'round.
What's up, man?
War is a continuation of politics...
only by other means.
Politics is a continuation
of economics by other means.
This is our bank.
This is our war.
And this is our plan of attack.
We need to create
a staged distraction.
James will jack four cars
and blow them up...
all over Central Business District
to draw out the cops.
As we enter,
Frankie will secure the guard...
and disable the cameras.
Spoonie, you take out
the hostages.
Sugar and I will grab the manager...
and go for the vault.
Our window of opportunity...
is five minutes after the vault
unlocks automatically...
according to our source
back at the warehouse.
No risk he'll squeal.
Nevertheless, James will be
on police scanner in the van.
And, James, we'll need
a nondescript getaway van.
Weapons and ammo on you, House.
We all clear?
Yo, it's a good plan, man.
It's a fucking stupid plan.
Jimmy, come on, man.
We each break out...
with, like, half a mil,
man, come on.
Jimmy, I need this, man.
We both need this.
We get our life
back on track.
- Erase all those lost years.
- I was on track, Frankie.
All right?
Now get lost.
Jimmy, come on, man.
Don't do this. Don't do this!
- Frankie, get the fuck out of my way.
- We need this, man.
- You can't walk.
- Get the fuck out of my way.
- Aw, come on, man. Jimmy, please.
- Look, you know what?
If you're going to rob a bank,
Frankie, you fucking-
you go in, you empty the tills,
then you run out.
You fucking drive like fuck.
Nobody actually goes
for the vault.
That's just
in the fucking movies, bro.
Yeah, but we got
the codes, bro.
We got the schedule
to the time release.
- That's fucking huge.
- They fucking killed a guy for it.
What the fuck
doesn't register with you?
I know that's bad, man.
That's fucking bad.
- It is fucking bad.
- Yeah, but what can I do?
What can I do
about it now, man?
They'll fucking kill you, bro.
They'll fucking kill you.
They'll kill me, man.
They'll even kill Emily.
How the fuck do they
even know about Emily?
What?
How the fuck do they
even know about Emily, huh?
- I don't know.
- Do they even fucking know about her?
I may have said something
about you guys.
- What the fuck did you say?
- No, no, no.
When I was in the joint,
I may have talked about you and Emily.
- Why the fuck are you talking about us?
- I was so happy for you.
There's no love in there.
I was happy for you guys.
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck.
Look, man,
there's no way out, man.
This guy, Ray,
he's like fucking-
he's like fucking Manson.
Why the fuck do you buy
into his shit, huh?
You don't know what it's like
being in there with the lifers.
I fucking-
it's brutal, man.
- These guys- he saved me. I owe him.
- Yeah, you owe him?
Yeah, so what?
You just going to be his little bitch now?
- Huh?
- What did you say?
You going to be
his fucking little bitch now?
- Don't you fucking talk-
- Just a fucking little clown.
- Don't you fucking say that to me!
- A little juggling clown.
You don't know what
I've fucking been through!
You don't know
what I've been through.
- You don't know!
- No, I don't know!
You don't know, man.
They fucked me-
Fucking took my swagger, Jimmy.
They took my swagger!
Fucking robbed me
from me, man.
They fucking broke me, bro.
You don't know shit.
You don't know what I've been through.
You don't know what
I've fucking lived through.
These motherfuckers...
What happened, bro?
Tell me what happened.
What the fuck happened to you?
I want my fucking bro back,
all right?
They fucked me, man.
They're fucked, Jimmy.
You don't know shit, man.
You don't know
fucking shit, man.
They fucked me in the ass
with toothpaste, man.
They fucked me in the ass
with toothpaste.
Bro, you don't know fucking shit!
- All right? They fucked me.
- They what?
This guy fucking saved me!
These guys fucking saved me.
I'd fucking be done, bro.
I swear to God, man.
I swear to God, listen to me.
They know we're only in it
for a one-time deal.
They're cool with that.
Okay?
Tuesday night we bounce.
Okay? We good, man.
I promise you, Jimmy.
I promise you. We don't have to do
anything like this again.
You won't have to do
anything like this.
Man, we don't have-
we're going to-
we don't have to be like Mom.
We can have fucking options.
We can have fucking options!
I'm going to get you
your own shop.
You won't have
to see me anymore.
You don't have to see me.
You just got
to trust me, Jimmy.
You got to trust me, man.
It's not so easy, bro.
It's not so easy, Frankie.
Hey, I know it's stressful.
But what in life isn't?
Thought you could use
a cold drink.
Hey, thanks.
I think it's going
to rain all week.
Hey, would you mind?
There's a ratchet over there on the table.
- Could you pass it to me?
- Ratchet?
Yeah, it might be
in the toolbox, actually.
I don't know what
a ratchet looks like.
Hey, you know what, actually?
You want to come over here
for a second and give me a hand?
Yeah, what do you need?
If you could hold that right there.
- Okay.
- And just keep that good and tight.
- Here?
- Yeah.
- You got it?
- Hmm, yeah. Got it.
- Yeah, just like that.
- Okay.
Right in here.
I'm going to tighten this up.
- And there she goes.
- Got it?
I got it.
- All right, thanks.
- You're welcome.
Even the rain is hot tonight.
Heard some crazy stories
about you while you were away.
Oh, yeah?
Like what?
We went to school
with some bitter people.
You mean stories
like I went to prison after Iraq?
Yeah.
So...
So?
They said the same thing
about Frankie.
Yeah, well,
don't listen to them.
Who should I listen to?
Look, Frankie and I
went traveling.
He stayed on,
I came home.
That's it,
end of story.
Okay.
So what happened
to your car?
I, uh...
I had to lend it
to my brother.
Frankie is back in town.
Yeah.
Yeah, he is.
Driving a car without a key.
Um...
uh, well, I, uh...
you see, I went down
to my work this morning...
to grab a loaner and, uh...
no one was around
and I couldn't find the keys and...
I know it looks
a little bit shady.
No, not at all.
I don't want to know.
Units, dispatch is available.
Do I come across clear?
Come here.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
- What are you doing, Frankie? I'm working.
- I know. I know, hey.
I know what you're thinking.
What are you doing
with a fucking yellow-
Know why?
Who would think I stole
a fucking yellow car?
- Who would steal a yellow car?
- Who would steal a yellow car?
Exactly. Nobody.
I'm smart.
And you know
if you're getting pussy...
and you drive this car,
you know she loves you.
- Come on, we got to go.
- Frankie, I'm working, I can't.
Got to make time, let's go.
Trust me, we got to go.
All right, one second.
Hey, Burnell, cover for me.
I'll be one second.
Yeah, all right.
I mean, really,
who steals a yellow car, though?
It goes with my green jacket.
And the brown.
Oh, so when I stole it,
I fucked the door up.
I'm, like, driving around
having to fucking hold the door.
It's a clown car, man.
This is embarrassing.
Let's just pull around the corner...
we'll jack something
that's not yellow, okay?
It's called fly yellow.
I think the suspension
on this car is fucked.
Fuck, man. Everybody can't be
as good as you, bro.
You really can't take
the fucking hot rods all the fucking time.
It's easy for me
to pop this shit. Come on.
All right, well...
All right,
we're getting good at this.
Nice job.
What's up?
Damn, whose funeral?
- Hey!
- Yours.
Yo, what the fuck
is your problem, man?
- You all right, Frankie?
- Yo, yo, Ray, man.
Shut the fuck up, Frankie.
Like Montezuma's Revenge
of the mouth.
What? I didn't say shit, man.
What the fuck?
- Why you hitting me, man?
- Yeah, man. What the fuck?
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck?
What the fuck was you doing
at the police station this morning?
Yo, chill, man.
Come on, man.
You think I don't know
about your little girlfriend?
You think she can't be
taken away from your life...
just as quickly as she
was brought back into it?
So let's try this
one more time.
Hold up, man.
I was dropping her off
for work, that's it.
All right? I haven't said jack shit.
She doesn't know nothing.
- I swear to God.
- At the police station?
- Yeah, she just works there, that's it.
- Oh, man.
- She a cop, Frank?
- Nah, man, come on.
- She's not a cop.
- Yo, I didn't know that.
- She's not a cop.
- She's not a cop, but I didn't know that.
- Is she a cop?
- She's not a cop. Please listen to me.
I promise you,
she's not a fucking cop, all right?
The fuck, man?
She ain't a cop.
We cool, right?
- Jimmy, tell them.
- I promise you she's not a fucking cop.
- All right?
- Chill, man. She ain't a cop.
Fuck.
Fucking my hair all up and shit.
- You all right?
- Don't shoot my dick, man.
- You be a'ight, man, relax.
- Don't point that shit at my dick.
- Come on, man.
- Fucker.
- Come on, Jimmy.
- What the fuck, Frankie?
Hey, remember-
remember when you almost
blew your hand off that Fourth of July...
with that homemade blockbuster
you made?
Shit, Jimmy, man.
That was crazy.
Every car alarm
in the neighborhood went off.
You were just looking at me, right?
I remember you had this
look in your eye like...
you're like...
Like you discovered pussy
or something.
I couldn't hear shit
for a week.
You're the one who put the sugar
in her gas tank, aren't you?
That was you.
Jimmy, come on.
You tried to set us up
so that I couldn't run.
Jimmy.
- That was you.
- Come on, Jimmy. I wouldn't do that.
I swear, Jimmy.
I didn't know
they were going to do that.
I didn't know, man.
I know, it's not nice.
I know.
But it's smart, though, right?
They needed someone close to you
to get to that you cared about, right?
So...
Anyway, look, hey,
it's a good thing, no?
I like that girl.
Nothing is going to happen.
Some fucking brother I got.
You're a fucking piece of work, Frankie.
You know that?
I'm done eating.
I'm done.
You remember
when Dad went away?
Hmm? Do you?
You were young.
Do you remember
how Mom fell apart?
What the fuck?
We had nothing.
No one to come to.
I remember that shit.
I remember I came home,
I found you locked out of the house...
'cause Mom had
a fucking nigger over.
And you were filthy.
And I cleaned you up.
I fed you.
I stole everything
for us, Jimmy.
Everything, man.
I stole everything for us.
All your gear,
your first set of tools.
Yeah, I made mistakes.
I'm a piece of shit.
What can I say?
I'm human.
But I always looked out
for my little brother...
to the best of my abilities.
Even if they were
somewhat impaired.
It was always me
and you against the world.
Me and you...
against the world.
Me and you, Frankie.
It was me and you.
I'm going to go take a piss.
Yo, Frankie.
Yeah?
You ever wonder
what life would be like if-
if you never pulled trigger
on that cop 10 years ago?
But I did, Jimmy.
I did.
Hey, I was just thinking about you.
I think we should
check out this new place...
in the Bywater.
I was just reading about it.
What do you think?
Something is wrong.
I, uh...
just wanted to let you know
that your car is good to go.
Okay, come on,
what's wrong?
Look, this last week...
the time
that we've had...
it's been a mistake.
Oh?
Yeah.
Yeah, 'course I was-
- It's, uh-
- No, you are absolutely right.
It's stupid trying to recreate something
that never existed...
- to begin with, because it didn't.
- It's not about that.
I'm agreeing with you.
- Emily.
- How much do I owe you?
- Emily, listen to me-
- No, this was about business.
This was about you
fixing my car, so let me pay you.
I don't want
your fucking money, all right?
I-
I'm sorry, it's just-
I care about you
and I can't explain things...
Obviously not.
- in a way that makes sense.
- You can't.
I understand perfectly.
Thank you.
I'm leaving town.
When?
Tomorrow.
You and your brother
traveling again?
Okay, okay. So...
- No, don't- I don't-
- Okay, so look.
- I put my name here-
- Emily, listen.
- You got to understand.
- Here.
- If things were different-
- It's okay.
- If I could just explain things to you-
- You can't. You can't.
- I wish I could make things different.
- It's okay.
I don't want to do this.
I don't want to do this.
Okay? Please.
Spare me.
Go, James.
Look, I just-
- I care about you-
- I get that.
You're still going.
Right?
So go.
- Go!
- All right, I'll leave you alone.
911, what's your emergency?
Yo, I'ma light you up.
- Pow, pow!
- You missed, yo. Ha, ha!
Ain't missing with this, bitch.
Boom!
Hey, Emily,
I'm going for a coffee.
- Want one?
- No, I'm good.
I'm already
on my second, thanks.
Dispatch, we got
an explosion in Greenpoint.
- Backup required.
- Unit 31, could you please repeat?
We got an explosion in Greenpoint.
Backup required.
I need units to respond
to alarms at St. Charles and Jackson...
and in the Quarter
at Ursulines and Chartres.
We have an MVA with a tour bus
and three chained vehicles.
I'm sorry, unit 61,
could you please repeat?
Did you say "a tour bus
and three chained vehicles"?
Copy that.
Another explosion...
reported by City Park, a car bomb.
Looks like it's going
to be a busy morning.
Looks like
it's going to rain.
Nobody fucking move!
Fucking move,
I'll show you your fucking insides.
Come on, get down!
Down, motherfucker! Down!
No phone calls, bitch!
You! Down!
Down!
Hands, ladies.
I want to see your fucking hands!
Against the fucking wall!
Let's go, ladies.
Out the back.
Get the fuck down!
Let's go!
Move it, move it, move it!
- Give me your cell phones.
- Stay down!
Quick, quick,
quick, quick.
Everybody listen up!
Take a deep breath
and relax!
We're here to rob the bank, not you.
In the five minutes
we spend here...
the CEO of this bank
will make more money...
off of all of you
than we take from him.
Banks have become an essential threat
to our democracy.
So consider this...
justice.
Don't be a hero.
- Don't. Look away. Look away!
- Look the fuck away!
The vault, now!
- Get the fuck up! Now!
- I can't open the vault.
Man, get out of here.
Let's go.
Get down, get down.
Get down, get down!
Move your fat fucking ass! Go!
Open that gate.
Get it open!
Look, it's not going to work.
Even if I give you the code...
this thing only opens
at predetermined times.
- Just enter the fucking code.
- It's not going to work!
I'll only say it one more time.
Enter the code.
Fuck you.
Hell, yeah! We'll get
this fucking money, too!
Oh, yeah, that's a lot
of fucking money.
Thanks a lot, man.
You've been a lot of help.
Nice. Whoo.
Bags.
Oh, shit! Fuck, man.
I think somebody saw me!
- Fuck! Shit!
- What? What?
- What a fucking dumb ass!
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
What the fuck
you looking at?
Stop fucking twitching or I'm going
to blow your fucking head off. Look down!
Yo, she's probably calling
the fucking cops.
- Get your shit together!
- Fuck, man! We got to go!
Calm down.
What the fuck time is it? Shit.
They're taking too long.
Two minutes.
- Where the fuck you going?
- Two fucking minutes!
- Where the fuck you going, man?
- Two minutes!
- Fuck!
- Okay, and how many did you see?
There was one inside the bank
and he had a mask...
and I think he had a gun, too.
David-four,
possible armed robbery in progress.
4140 Canal Street,
Mid-City. Do you copy?
Roger that.
We'll check it out.
Hey, yo, time's up, man.
We got to go.
We got 30 seconds, come on!
Help him. Hold his gun!
Grab his bag, come on.
Hurry up, though.
Hurry up, come on.
We got to go, come on!
Man, that's a lot of fucking dough.
Yeah, baby!
Yo, cops are coming, man.
We got to go!
Ah, man, this is not good.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Where is everybody?
- In the fucking vault!
They been there forever!
Where the fuck you going?
Where you going?
Get back in the fucking van!
- Get back in the fucking van!
- Calm the fuck down, all right?
Fuck!
I'm going to fucking kill-
don't fucking move!
That's good. That's good.
That's good. That's good.
Yo! Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here!
- Yeah, we got to go!
- We got to go now! Come on!
Yo, leave it!
Yo, Spoonie.
Where the fuck is Spoonie?
Spoonie!
Where the fuck is Spoonie?
Oh, shit!
Five-0, five-0!
Get the fuck
away from the windows!
- He's got the fucking van!
- The fucking van?
Yo, he's gone, bro!
- Jimmy!
- Shit!
Fuck.
Aah!
Confirmed armed robbery
in progress...
at the Canal Street Savings Bank.
Shots have been fired.
All available units respond.
Get the fuck down!
Motherfucker!
Aah! Fuck!
You all right?
Frankie!
Are you hit?
Ah, shit. Jimmy.
Oh, shit!
Fuck!
All right, listen up!
We have to adapt
to a changing situation.
- New game plan.
- Game plan?
Spoonie ran off
with his bitch-ass...
with our motherfucking
getaway truck!
We still have
the advantage, Sugar.
These are first response city cops!
They have handguns
and shotguns.
We have machine guns
and the high ground.
But we got to move before
they improve their position.
Ray, man. I'm fucking bleeding, man.
Yo, I'm fucking bleeding!
There is no other option, Frankie!
Now listen to me.
We need another getaway car.
That's our only way
out of here. James!
You got to get to the side entrance
and jack us another car!
- Hang in there, Frankie!
- Frankie, listen to me.
We're going to get out of here.
We need collateral!
Sugar, cover me.
Go!
- What's your name?
- Katie. Katie!
All right, Katie.
You be cool, you live.
- You freak out on me, you die.
- Okay.
Got it? Let's go!
Come on, James!
Let's go, James!
I got Frankie!
- Get up, man.
- Frankie, we're going to get out of here.
Go with Sugar, okay?
Get up, man,
we got to go!
We got to go, man!
Come on, Frankie, get up!
- I'm bleeding out, man.
- We got to go, man!
Fuck, dude.
Get in the car!
Go, go, go, go, go!
- Drive!
- Where's Frankie?
- Go, go, go, go!
- Where the fuck is Frankie?
Frankie's as good as dead, James.
Let's go!
Let's get the fuck
out of here!
What the fuck
are you doing? Go, go!
I'm not leaving
without Frankie!
Come on! Go, move!
Shit!
I got you covered.
Go!
Here's what we know so far.
Gunfire has been exchanged...
with at least two suspects
trying to escape the bank.
Looks like some assailants
are still inside holding hostages.
What we don't know
is exactly how...
Frankie.
I'm sorry.
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm bleeding out.
All right. I'm going
to take a look, all right?
Okay?
Shit.
All right,
it's not that bad.
We got to stop
this bleeding, though.
All right...
let's get you fixed up
and get the fuck out of here.
All right?
I'm going to go get some supplies.
I'll be right back.
We'll get you
all fixed up, all right?
All right, I'll book it.
Keep going!
- Go! Go!
- Yeah, man.
Sugar!
Oh!
Motherfucker!
Oh, shit!
- Hey, lady. Come here, get up.
- All right.
All right, I'm trying to get up.
- Get up. I'm not going to hurt you.
- Shit!
Come on. Come on.
Come in here.
Get the fuck back!
Tell your guys
to get the fuck back!
All right?
I got hostages in here!
I'm going to start throwing bodies
out the window.
We're standing down.
Stand down!
This is Captain Sullivan speaking.
- Is everybody all right in there?
- What you think?
Do you need anything?
Do you need medical assistance?
No! Just get your fucking guys
the fuck away from this bank!
I'm going to start fucking
murdering people!
Okay, I'm here
to help you.
Son, you tell me
what you want.
I just want-
you know what?
I want to talk
to a real fucking negotiator...
all right, Captain Whatever-
the-fuck-your-name-is?
Okay, son. He's been contacted.
He's en route.
Negotiator is on the way.
All right.
Just stay the fuck away
from this fucking bank!
Come on, ma'am.
All right,
you did good.
You did good.
Thank you very much.
Here you go.
I need a first aid kit.
Where the fuck is
the first aid kit here?
Somebody, where the fuck
is the first aid kit in here?
Okay, Central.
I've got eyes on the suspect.
He's on foot heading north
on Royal Street.
What the- Look out!
Ah, fuck!
Mother- motherfucker!
Okay, last one.
- All right.
- Holy-
Take a deep breath.
All right.
All right.
- All right, good as new.
- Oh, God.
Come here.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Come here.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit, Jimmy.
Oh, shit.
Jimmy, what are we going to do?
What are we
going to do?
We're going to wait
for the negotiator to show up.
Okay.
I'm not going back.
I'm not going back.
We can't shoot
our way out of here, bro.
I'm not going back.
You hear me?
I'm not going back.
Think of something.
Yeah, all right. I know.
- No, you got to think of something.
- I know.
- Come up with something.
- I know, all right?
They're wolves in there, Jimmy.
They're wolves in there.
I can't go back.
All right.
You just got to do
what I say, okay?
Got to do what I say.
Fuck!
...invested in me,
I now pronounce you...
husband and wife.
Get back.
I got a hostage!
I'll kill her!
I'll kill her!
Step back!
You! You!
- Back!
Freeze!
Target down!
All right!
You put down your guns,
I'll let y'all live!
All right, I ain't
going to warn you no more!
This is it!
Jimmy.
Yeah, Frankie?
I'm just a thief.
All my life...
nothing but a thief.
And I stole from you.
And I stole from you, bro.
Do you forgive me?
Do you forgive me, Jimmy?
You're my brother, Frankie.
I love you.
I love you, too, man.
I love you, too.
What the-
You!
Come here.
Jimmy.
Jimmy, wake up.
You got to get up.
Get up. Get up.
Jimmy...
I got to do it.
What the fuck
are you doing?
I got to do it, Jimmy.
Oh, shit, Frankie.
Shit, Jimmy.
All right, easy, easy, easy.
We got you.
We got you.
Okay, just hang tight.
Hang tight.
Hang tight.
Let's get you undone here.
I'm going to take care
of you, sir.
All right.
Come in!
The hostage I was working on
is not a hostage!
I repeat,
he is not a hostage!
He's headed north
on Carondelet.
He's on foot.
Do you copy?
Yeah, roger that.
- Hey, Emily.
- I can't.
