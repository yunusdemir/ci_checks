<i>Images of Finland</i>
is a film about Finland.
<i>Finland is a riddle</i>
<i>As obscure as a woman</i>
<i>We know not how our journey ends</i>
<i>The journey we now begin</i>
<i>It may simply go to hell</i>
<i>It might though turn out well</i>
<i>Finland is a cold land</i>
<i>And yet we don't freeze</i>
<i>We all speak the same language</i>
<i>Some worse than others</i>
<i>We live together happily</i>
<i>Some more than others</i>
<i>Finland is an affluent country</i>
<i>But not many believe it</i>
<i>Real poverty and riches</i>
<i>Live here side by side</i>
<i>It would be a sign of weakness</i>
<i>To make everything equal</i>
Has it become easier
to travel in Finland?
Are people
more closely connected now?
THE HELSINKI - TAMPERE EXPRESS
Yes, it has become easier and faster.
Improved living standards
have helped people to travel.
But what has brought people together-
- is mainly the mass media,
above all television.
It's got negative aspect
too in some respects.
If you travelled in Northern Finland
ten years ago-
- the opinions there clearly differed
from the opinions in the south.
Now we all speak the same language,
even the same dialect.
Helsinki dominates everything.
Finland will become,
say in ten years time-
- one homogenous culture,
due to the mass media.
Morning flight from Helsinki to Oulu.
It's early spring, March.
Fasten your seat belts
and start reading.
The journey you're now beginning
will take you all over Finland.
You will see rich and poor,
well-known and unknown people.
We speak for the lowly paid
and the under-privileged.
We want
the same opportunities for all.
Inherited wealth or poverty
should not run our lives.
<i>Finland is a neutral country</i>
<i>Anyone will tell you that</i>
<i>With communists</i>
<i>Who defend the poor</i>
<i>And capitalists</i>
<i>Who keep them under</i>
<i>Finland is the fatherland</i>
<i>Even for those who leave it</i>
<i>There is not work for everyone</i>
<i>The fortunate succeed</i>
<i>Some are hungry, some are fed</i>
<i>A few can even save</i>
- I'd like to be a professor.
- A professor of what?
- Sociology, most likely.
- You're going to study sociology?
Where will you get the money?
What's most important to me is
that I can determine myself...
I aim to be independent.
- How do you mean?
- By working.
I don't have any traditional benefits
or support from my parents.
I'll study and work at the same time.
What have you been doing
for the last five years?
I've been doing road work.
What if the road work runs out?
What will happen then?
I don't know.
I don't know where to look for work.
- Haven't you thought about moving?
- No, not yet.
- Or leaving the country?
- No.
Can you get any training
here in Nurmes?
Not really. There's only
a sawmill and a dairy here.
Nothing for men like me.
- How much do you earn a month?
- About 600 marks.
That's not much
as I have to pay the rent and all.
- How much is the rent?
- 50 marks.
It's a small one-room cottage.
<i>Have you heard about the devil?</i>
<i>The enemy of the soul?</i>
<i>A tail on his bum</i>
and horns on his head
<i>Filling up hell with sinners</i>
<i>God made man in his own image</i>
<i>The bourgeois made the world</i>
<i>In place of the angelic host</i>
<i>They made earthly devils</i>
<i>These tailless devils</i>
<i>Don't work in hell</i>
<i>They occupy positions of power</i>
<i>And issue orders from there</i>
<i>These tailless devils</i>
<i>Don't work in hell</i>
<i>They occupy positions of power</i>
<i>And issue orders from there</i>
<i>The tailless devil</i>
makes no threat of fire
<i>But eviction and the sack</i>
serve just as well
<i>The priest doesn't oppose him</i>
<i>He represents big capital</i>
<i>Prayers can't drive him out</i>
<i>Nor promises to the gods</i>
<i>He builds a heaven for the rich</i>
<i>And a hell for the poor</i>
<i>These tailless devils</i>
<i>Don't work in hell</i>
<i>They occupy positions of power</i>
<i>And issue orders from there</i>
The Parliamentary Elections,
15th - 16th March 1970.
It's snowing in Helsinki. On the
morning of the first polling day-
- people are queuing
for the polling stations.
Today the people exercise their right
to choose their representatives.
The election campaign has cost
the parties millions of marks.
Rich candidates
have spent up to 50000 marks.
Faces known from television
have a better chance.
The right family name may also help.
Over twenty percent of the people
do not vote.
The Popular Front
has held office for four years.
Devaluation has favoured exports,
and as incomes are frozen-
- the wage earners' share
of the national product has decreased.
At a polling station in Nurmijärvi
we meet Mr Martti Kärkkäinen.
Do you believe that you can influence
the choice of government?
There isn't much chance
but one vote could just do it.
But it's a real small chance.
I don't really believe it.
- Is it worth voting?
- You should use your right to vote.
Have you thought about
the fact that your vote also decides-
- who the leaders of state companies-
- and state radio
and television will be?
It doesn't go that far.
Someone else decides that.
Of course, that's what it
leads to in the end-
- but not directly.
- Did you vote for the same party?
- I'm not quite sure.
- Yes.
- How can you be so sure?
Well, we've talked about it.
- Do you tell your wife how to vote?
- No.
Has your husband's propaganda
affected you?
No, it hasn't and it won't.
I make up my own mind.
How much
do you discuss these matters?
Now before the elections
we sometimes ponder together-
- what's happening and so forth.
What would you like
your MP to achieve?
- A lot of good.
- What for instance?
Well, it's hard to say...
Like welfare.
How would you improve the world?
Everyone should have a chance
to be something, or at least to try.
This may be a bold statement-
- but people should be given
a chance to have a crack at it.
- Is it worth voting?
- Yes.
- Can one vote make a difference?
- Yes, it can.
I wish it did,
but you can't rely on it.
It has already become clear that
the left wing has lost the elections-
- and that the right wing
has won by a landslide.
We were given permission to film at
the TV studio on the election night-
- but the head of Channel 1
tries to prevent us from filming.
This is not the first or last time
that those in charge-
- will act this pompously.
The politics that our party exercised
while in opposition...
Later that night we visit the National
Coalition Party's head quarters.
One of the newly-elected MPs
is Pertti Salolainen-
- who got nearly 20,000 votes.
His face, like many others,
is well known from television.
What do you hope to achieve now?
Not much on my own
but the party has grown.
First of all,
we have younger MPs than before.
Secondly, we have more MPs.
I don't even know the final number.
We are now the third largest party.
Are you the youngest MP
of the National Coalition Party?
I think I am.
Do you see yourself as a symbol
for a rejuvenated right wing?
Yes, I do.
I want to see this party forge ahead.
Does that mean that your outlook
on party lines is not as restricted?
Yes, exactly.
One of my most important aims is-
- to create co-operation
among the right wing parties-
- and why not co-operation
among all parties-
- but above all, among the right.
Change of leadership takes place
at the Parliament House on 2nd April.
The new MPs assume their mandate.
Many wonder if a majority government
will take over.
Nobody knows whether the left is split
or whether it will pull together.
Both the National Coalition
and the Finnish Rural Party want in.
Many MPs are not
so concerned about the government.
They are simply glad to be safely back
at the Parliament House.
Also the Radio and TV council
will have a right-wing majority.
What about the voters now
that the elections are over?
They have expressed their will
through the ballot-box-
- and also through
the numerous letters I receive.
I will follow their will closely
after the elections as well.
Does this mean that
also in previous governments-
- the voters have influenced you?
A politician cannot survive
without the support of the electorate.
This time
the voters' answer is very clear.
- And what is it?
- Our party should take a breather.
We're out of the game.
14th May 1970,
a caretaker government was formed.
14th July 1970,
a coalition government took over.
The Centre 4,
The Liberals 1, The SDP 5-
- The People's Democratic League 3,
non-party 2.
<i>Bloody hell!</i>
Helsinki Airport, 28th March 1970.
Departure day for Australia.
Why are you emigrating?
To get a better job.
They pay so little here.
- What has been your line of work here?
- Mainly metal work.
- How much have you earned?
- 500 marks a month.
- What did you do before?
- I was at school.
What do you hope to gain
in Australia? More pay or what?
More pay, naturally.
At least I've been promised more.
- How much?
- They've promised over 1,000 marks.
- What other reasons do you have?
- The warm climate.
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes, the summers are much warmer.
Blomqvist, Erkko from Lappeenranta.
Could you tell me a little
about why you're leaving?
Well, I've been unemployed.
I was in the haulage business.
- I worked day and night.
- How much did you earn?
- It varied. I worked on percentage.
- Approximately?
About 1,000 marks.
But I had to work-
- 18 - 20 hours a day.
So you're leaving
for financial reasons?
- Mainly.
- Does your wife work?
- You've never worked?
- No, I have enough work at home.
- What kind of home did you have?
- We had our own house.
Did you sell it? Did you get enough
for it so you'll manage in Australia?
- We'll manage for a while.
- And I'll get my pay.
- So you have sold everything?
- Yes, everything.
- All our belongings are in these bags.
- How many kilos?
- 56 kilos.
- Is that all?
Nearly 300,000 Finns
have moved to Sweden-
- most for good.
Annually, about a thousand move to
Australia, somewhat fewer to Canada.
The population of Finland
is decreasing.
It is reducing our chances-
- as it's hard for a small nation
to be alone and independent.
Almost all of those who leave say
they do so to earn more money.
Then make a turn. Continue.
- How did you come up with the idea?
- For the model school?
It's a very long story.
I started giving the training
back in 1953.
Before that I took the training myself
for a couple of years.
- Is it worthwhile?
- For me or the girls?
I should hope so.
Many of the girls work abroad.
The whole of Finland
can benefit from this.
It's great publicity for Finland.
Feel free to comment on
the performance here.
Open the coat with one hand, gently.
Then a full turn.
Do the full turn there in the middle.
Good. Step forward,
then turn and down.
Close the coat again. Good.
Next.
You can go and sit down.
- Who's next?
- Of the girls, you mean?
Her? Excuse me, may I interrupt? What
do you want to be when you grow up?
I don't know yet. If I manage this,
I'll try to pursue this career.
If I get a diploma here,
I'll start looking for a job.
- What do you do now?
- I work in a shop.
- Is this a childhood dream?
- Yes, it is.
- Do you think you'll make it?
- I don't know yet.
- Do you do this for the money, too?
- Partly.
- What do you think a model earns?
- I don't know.
How much does a good model earn?
If we're talking about top models-
- they make about 250 marks a show.
- There aren't many of those.
- Maybe one a year.
- What about the average earning?
- It's 100 - 150 marks.
- Per month?
- It's hard to say.
It depends on how much you work.
A good model makes a nice living.
I'd say something
like 20,000 marks a year.
Are you doing what you hoped to do
when you were young?
This is not exactly my dream job.
I've worked here since I left school.
- What was your dream job?
- I like to sing.
- A singer?
- But dreams don't always come true.
- Have you tried to become a singer?
- No.
Is it an artistic interest,
or is it the money?
I don't think I'd earn much more.
I'm happy with what I earn now.
- May I talk with you for a while?
- Sure.
Can you speak up?
It's quite noisy here.
- How long have you been working here?
- Two weeks.
- Are you from Hanko?
- No, from Lapinlahti.
How did you end up working here?
I wanted a bit of a change.
- Where did you work before?
- I worked for Luhtanen in Nastola.
- Was it similar work there?
- No.
- There I did perforating and marking.
- What do you want out of life?
I want to do well
and start a family at some point.
- What does "doing well" mean?
- I don't know exactly...
Not to have much debt
and to sort of get along.
- Is starting a family important?
- Yes, it is.
<i>Who would dream great dreams?</i>
<i>Someone dreams of riches</i>
<i>Someone wants a better home</i>
<i>Or better clothes</i>
<i>Someone has a long way to work</i>
<i>The neighbours keep you awake</i>
<i>Someone crashed their car</i>
<i>People want improvements</i>
<i>Great dreams fade in bitterness</i>
<i>Small dreams</i>
are more easily fulfilled
<i>We cannot decide the end</i>
<i>They let us vote from time to time</i>
<i>The bosses are thrilled</i>
<i>And make more dreams</i>
<i>Nine workers out of ten</i>
<i>Want to be pop stars</i>
<i>We don't dream great dreams</i>
<i>We won't change society</i>
<i>We won't socialise the banks</i>

<i>The people want peace and housing</i>
<i>Security and jobs</i>
<i>They feel powerless to change things</i>

Do you stay in Finland
out of patriotism?
No, that doesn't mean anything to me,
wherever you manage.
It doesn't matter
when your health is deteriorating.
Here
the social welfare system is better.
How do you see Finland
as a fatherland?
Doesn't Finland really mean
anything to you?
A good country is where you get by
and feel at home.
There are many interpretations
for the concept of fatherland.
You can consider a country
a good fatherland-
- if you earn a decent living there.
- No matter which country it is?
- Yes.
But the country you're born in
is special, of course.
Festivals commemorate the victims
of war and Marshal Mannerheim.
Students gather
to carry torches to the graves.
The speeches are
about past sacrifices.
Today the country is something else.
There is a growing awareness,
an active fight against injustice.
The past is for museums.
- Does Finland mean anything?
- It used to.
- When?
- It doesn't these days.
I don't see much patriotism
in Finland at the moment.
What about
your first international match?
Yes, that was something.
I was shaking.
Do you get something out of hockey,
apart from the occasional fights?
Sure,
otherwise I wouldn't be playing.
- Is it the team spirit?
- Partly, the lads and that.
Do you think
that people come to see you fight?
No, I think they come to shout at me
and let off steam.
The Friday night ferry
from Turku to Stockholm.
For most Finns, Stockholm is the first
encounter with the outside world.
Sumptuous food, inexpensive drinks
and tax-free shops.
A cheap drink, dancing
and a hangover in Stockholm.
A strange city
with a different rhythm of life.
We, too, are travelling to Stockholm,
hungover.
We go to the same night club
as everybody else.
At the door we meet Pulmu Myrttinen
and her friend Seija.
It's nice to dance with Pulmu.
- Why do you come to a night club?
- It's fun.
- Don't you have any nicer?
- Interests?
Sure, but I have to come here
sometimes, too.
- Why do you go to Stockholm?
- Life is freer there.
- How is it freer?
- Compared to Helsinki?
- You know very well.
- Yes, but explain it to me.
- Stop it.
- No, we won't stop.
- How is it freer there?
- Tell him to stop.
- You mean sex is freer?
- No.
- What do you do in Helsinki?
- I work, study, do gymnastics.
- Do you have any other hobbies?
- No.
- Do you do gymnastics alone?
- Yes, always alone.
Are you going to the night club now?
Never mind.
Don't drink too much.
- No, just a few.
- Go on then.
Are you driving us away?
Stop filming.
We'll carry on with this inside.
Pulmu, wait!
I want to tell you something.
No, I don't want you to hear.
- What's your name?
- I'm Seija, hi.
- Why are you going to Stockholm?
- To work.
- Do you work there?
- I'm starting now.
- Are you leaving dear old Finland?
- Only for a while.
- Why?
- Because...
- For the same reason as Pulmu?
- No, I want to see the world.
Sweden's the nearest place.
If it's no good, I'll come back.
I don't want to go far but
I can go to Sweden for a short time.
- Is life freer there?
- Don't know. I haven't tried it.
Try it then.
Slussen,
one of Stockholm's traffic carousels-
- is called by many Swedes
the Carelian Isthmus.
The long passageways
are full of Finns.
Bootleggers, drunks
and people who are just stuck here.
The diligent Finns go elsewhere,
to the Volvo factory in Gothenburg-
- to Northern Sweden, to work for Asea
in Västerås or Saab in Trollhättan.
Sweden could not manage
without Finnish workers.
Over 100,000 Finns
live around Stockholm.
Stockholm is
Finland's fourth largest city.
No. I think that the whole myth-
- about Swedes hating Finns
is invented by Finns themselves.
- An inferiority complex?
- Probably.
- They accept you completely?
- Absolutely.
- And you accept the Swedes?
- Yes, I like Swedes.
- And now you're leaving for Spain?
- Yes, I'm going to miss them.
- The Swedes are so kind.
- And stupid?
I wouldn't say so.
We've been told that many Finns
in Stockholm go to the strip clubs-
- which are numerous and varied.
The programme varies but
the overall quality is equally poor.
The same expensive magazines,
sex guides and stimulation appliances-
- Ioose cocks and cunts,
crocodile condoms-
- and the same cheap nudity.
The sex bars seem
to satisfy the needs of many.
Few complain about the high prices
and the poor quality of the programme.
The stripper in our pictures
works in the same bar-
- where we met Aarne,
the Finnish manager.
We exchanged
the following thoughts with him.
It all started when I got to thinking-
- that the other jobs
required more work than this job.
- When did you start here?
- Three years ago.
- You've been doing well?
- Not too bad.
What's the show like?
There's the stripper and films and the
intimate bar with topless waitresses.
Do you think
we'd need this in Finland?
It seems so.
Lots of Finns come over for this.
- Because it's not allowed in Finland?
- No doubt.
- It's a forbidden fruit.
- I don't know why it's not allowed.
- Do you still like Finland?
- Why shouldn't I?
- Do you still go there?
- Yes, I do.
- Are you going to expand?
- Let's see how it goes.
How many percent of your customers
are Finns?
Maybe about 15 percent.
- Are they visitors or locals?
- Both.
Most of those who visit us only once
come from Finland.
At the end of the road
lies Haparanda, Sweden.
When it's nine o'clock in Finland,
it's eight there.
Goods are the same on both sides,
but at the moment Finland is cheaper.
The Haparanda unemployment office
is visited-
- by Finns on their way
to work all over Sweden.
Those who stay in Northern Sweden
won't have any language problems.
Kiruna has a large Finnish population.
The rest will end up
in a strange new world.
- The young people here are different.
- How are they different?
They're not as crazy as us.
I mean...
Here you have to drink a lot
and fight.
First they sit in a bar
and have a few beers.
Then they shout and sing and dance.
Otherwise they don't say a word.
- Do you drink?
- Yes, sometimes.
- Here or on the Swedish side?
- I can't here.
- Why not?
- The age limit is 18 here, 16 there.
- How old are you?
- 16.
What do your teachers say
about you going to Sweden to drink?
I haven't talked with them about it.
They're a bit old-fashioned.
- Do people take drugs here in Tornio?
- No, you can't get drugs here.
Some brag
that they've taken drugs but...
They say
that the stuff is bad and expensive.
- What do you think of Finland?
- Of Finland?
It's a beautiful country
with all the lakes and everything.
- But the people spoil it.
- Don't you like Finns?
Some I do and some I don't.
Some are like statues.
- They are killjoys?
- Exactly.
What do you want to do
when you grow up?
If I manage to graduate from school,
I'll hitchhike round the world.
- I'm not going to the university.
- What kind of work do you want?
I don't know... When I leave school,
I'll take a ten-year holiday.
- Have you got any money?
- Not a penny.
- Any possessions?
- A teddy bear.
What would you do
if you had money and possessions?
A lot of money? Then I would build
free hostels for hitchhikers.
They could stay there overnight.
I'm serious.
What if you only had a bit of money,
so that you could get by?
I'd do as much as I could with it.
Buy a round for everybody
when I'm in a good mood.
Buy them some cigarettes.
What else can you do?
<i>A car on the southern roads</i>
<i>On the way to the new village centre</i>
<i>A co-op store and a dairy</i>
<i>A new farmers' union building</i>
<i>Here roots grow deep in the soil</i>
<i>With the support of the Centre Party</i>
<i>The Workers' House</i>
sleeps its last sleep
<i>Nowadays it is a timber store</i>
<i>As the stories tell</i>
<i>This land is owned by few</i>
<i>They do as they want</i>
<i>And the townsfolk pay the piper</i>
<i>If anyone says the farmers are rich</i>
<i>They pretend to be poor</i>
<i>And point to the small farmer</i>
<i>To prove how hard life is</i>
<i>A stranger sees six shops</i>
<i>Someone here has money to spend</i>
<i>The shopkeepers</i>
claim to be on the breadline
<i>They blame the margarine industry</i>
<i>As the stories tell</i>
<i>This land is owned by few</i>
<i>They do as they want</i>
<i>And the townsfolk pay the piper</i>
How do you make a living here?
We do whatever we can.
The farming doesn't pay.
- We do what we can.
- What do you grow?
- Potatoes, of course.
- Have you got any cattle?
- No, no cattle.
- You do forest work?
- Yes, forest work.
- In our own forest?
- How much forest have you got?
- How much is it now?
- 100 hectares.
- 100 hectares.
- Not much pay per hour, I guess.
- That's true.
- My pal here is getting old.
- There are lots of disused farms here.
- It seems pretty quiet.
- The young go to Sweden.
A lot of fields are put
out of cultivation these days.
Have you benefited from this policy?
When you've got a small farm
like I have-
- about 6 - 7 hectares, if you farm
it well, you get bread even for sale-
- even if
you have 3 - 4 people to feed.
Fields like that shouldn't be
put out of cultivation.
It's wrong.
When one farm does that,
dozens of others follow suit.
Then we don't get as much milk
and we have to give up the cows.
Do you have too much butter
here in the north, too?
If we have too much butter,
it has no effect in the south.
We haven't got too much.
We want more production
and more cows.
Otherwise
the farmers can't survive here.
They can't earn a living.
The politicians who decide on
these matters should be kicked out.
It's wrong to do that to agriculture.
We used to plough and hoe the fields-
- and now they plant trees on them.
What is
the most important issue to you?
The nation's wealth
must be redistributed.
People with low income need to get
more. Human dignity must be revived.
We must have honesty, justice,
impartiality, responsibility.
We must have real democracy,
not horse-dealing.
We now have
a mirage of democracy.
What do you think of appointments
made on political grounds?
They are wrong. They're decided
upon behind the scenes.
No-one cares if the appointee
is competent or right-minded.
The whole nation suffers
as a result of bad civil servants.
A minister must be known
for his honesty and ability.
This constitutional rule
has been broken.
You've been in politics for a long
time. How do you manage to carry on?
Some inner strength helps me.
I've noticed that when you're honest
and have a clear conscience-
- you can sleep well
and carry on the struggle.
I fight also for my children
and the whole Finnish nation.
We cannot go on like this.
All major institutions like this
should be socialised.
Then the employees would have
more say in the company-
- more say than they have now.
Of course,
it can entail more bureaucracy-
- but industrial democracy
could be a reality.
- You haven't reached that stage yet?
- No, not at all.
Neste is not socialised,
even thought it's a state company.
A company with a powerful head, like
Mr Raade, can't really be democratic.
We've talked about it with Mr Raade.
I asked him when we will have
industrial democracy at Neste.
Mr Raade answered,
"As long as I'm in charge,
there will be no democracy."
<i>The Finnish state</i>
owns the Neste company
<i>The Finnish people own the state</i>
<i>But can the people</i>
make the decisions?
<i>No, that is Mr Raade's job</i>
<i>While there's</i>
room for dictators here
<i>Uolevi Raade fills the bill</i>
<i>As the company develops and grows</i>
<i>We must put up with him</i>
<i>The servant has become master</i>
and so it goes on
<i>Things might get unpleasant</i>
when you try to change them
<i>Mr Raade earns forty workmen's pay</i>
<i>For managing the firm</i>

MIDSUMMER
PORI AIRPORT
I've come to see the people
and the flying display.
Have you celebrated
midsummer here before?
- Yes, as a child.
- Do you live here?
No, I live in...
I don't want to say.
Isn't there a better place
to spend a midsummer?
It's a matter of taste.
- Wouldn't it be nicer at home?
- I don't think so.
- Do you have to go somewhere?
- No, but sometimes you want to.
- Where do you work?
- In a paper mill.
- How much do you earn?
- That's a private matter.
The people with low pay
would like to know.
I'm paid quite well.
That's all I'm saying.
- But not too well?
- Quite well.
- So you earn enough?
- You've got to live according to it.
What do you do there at the mill?
I fill boxes.
This man hardly
needs to be introduced.
Tonight, now that the clock
has struck twelve...
Our guest is Rodney Harrington,
but his real name Ryan O'Neal.
He asked me to say-
- that he is overwhelmed
by our midsummer celebrations-
- so he is a bit tired.
He says he can't believe how many
beautiful women he has seen here.
Nobody's going to believe him
when he goes home.
<i>Why is there no bear</i>
on Finland's coat of arms?
<i>He and we both hibernate</i>
<i>We live only for three months</i>
<i>And quietly sleep</i>
for the rest of the year
<i>Most babies are conceived in summer</i>
<i>In the long evening light</i>
<i>Plants grow up towards the light</i>
<i>So do people after the dark winter</i>
<i>A bottle, a bird on midsummer night,</i>
the high point of our year
<i>Rainy days and back to work,</i>
the reckoning soon comes
<i>We take all we can out of summer</i>
<i>Three months of light and warmth</i>
<i>Radios blare on the beaches</i>
<i>The bushes sway</i>
by the country dance
<i>A bottle, a bird on midsummer night,</i>
the high point of our year
<i>Rainy days and back to work,</i>
the reckoning soon comes
Almost 30,00 youngsters
gather to this rock festival.
Ruisrock has been called
the Finnish Woodstock, but it's not.
No children were born,
no political protests carried out.
The police say that the youngsters
behaved surprisingly well.
Ruisrock's popularity shows how little
choice there is for young people.
Society gives millions
for traditional culture-
- and for the new culture
a few thousands.
- Would you say balls to Finland?
- No, I wouldn't.
- You're happy with the place?
- Yes, I am.
- You wouldn't like to move?
- No.
My home is here, my roots are here,
my friends are here.
Is Finland a conservative place?
Is there much you would change?
Pretty conservative
but it will change with time.
I'm happy right now.
My friends are not that conservative.
What do you?
What do you want to be?
I want to be a housewife
and get married young.
Can you keep your freedom then?
I think so.
Are you looking for a husband here?
I'm looking
but I don't know if I'll find one.
What are your other interests?
I don't really have interests
except for drawing.
- Do you want lots of money?
- I manage with what I get.
- Where do you get it from?
- From my parents.
- How much?
- It depends.
Maybe about 10 - 20 marks a week.
- Are you interested in politics?
- No.
- You're not interested at all?
- Not yet.
You trust everything your parents do,
for you or against you?
- Yes, because I'm so young...
- How old are you?
I'm fifteen. I'll take sides later.
- You're just looking for a husband.
- That's all.
- What have you been doing here?
- I've been drinking non-stop.
- Are you still drunk?
- Yes, I am.
- Are you feeling OK?
- I always feel OK when I'm drunk.
When I'm drunk, I feel marvellous
and everything goes well.
- Do you want to be drunk all the time?
- Yes, I do.
What else do you do?
Do you work?
I haven't worked for seven years
and don't intend to.
- Where do you get your money?
- I bum it.
- So you live by bumming?
- Yes.
- Do you think it's wrong to work?
- No, absolutely not.
Working is worth it-
- if you've got a trade
and you can work.
I can't work
because it makes me too nervous.
- Have you got any trade?
- Certainly I have.
- What kind of trade?
- I'm a welder and a painter.
I've got good trades but
I can get the same money by bumming.
I make the same money on the street
that I'd make by working.
- Have you travelled a lot?
- Yes, a bit.
Have you been abroad?
Have you bummed there as well?
- What do you think of Finland?
- A hell of a good place in summer.
- What about in winter?
- It's OK in winter, too.
- You wouldn't like to move?
- Yes, I would.
I'd like to move
but I can't right now.
- Aren't you worried about winter?
- Not at all.
- Isn't it hard to be a bum at winter?
- No.
- You'll find a place to stay?
- I've got a place and a pass key.

Censorship is a form of paternalism.
TV is closely scrutinised.
Films have been banned and cut
by censors.
This supports a double morality.
The guardians of reactionary morality
have stiffened their defences.
Drink and fornicate
but do it in secret.
Family, school and church
must be protected at all cost.
In Kajaani "the swine walk down one
street, the bourgeois down the other".
Along the bourgeois street are
most of the banks, shops and bars.
The Champion was for you
and the whisky for you.
Kerttu owns a hairdressing salon
and employs nine girls.
She has invited them out
for a drink and a dance.
We talked to Kerttu in the bar.
Could you imagine
opening a salon in Helsinki?
If I met a man
who would take me to Helsinki...
- Why a man?
- I wouldn't dream of going alone.
- Don't you dare to?
- No, I'm doing very nicely here.
I don't want to move.
But if a man came into my life-
- and said we are moving,
I would go with him.
I guess it would be quiet for a while
but I'm sure I'd manage.
As an entrepreneur,
do you have any political views?
- Not really.
- But you do vote?
Of course I vote but...
- Just for faces?
- Yes.
- What if it's a left wing face?
- Then I don't vote.
- So you vote for the right?
- Yes, absolutely.
I think of what's good for me-
- and who will
stand by us and support us.
I don't vote for somebody
who's against us.
- What was your childhood like?
- We were a big family.
- Were you poor?
- Yes, we had a farm.
Everyone thought I would marry
a farmer's boy and stay there.
- But you left?
- Yes.
When I left school,
I knew I didn't want to stay.
I had to become something else
and have money.
I wanted to look good
and show that I am someone.
I don't want to be a nobody.
Kauhava is a town
in Southern Ostrobothnia.
The landscape is flat.
It's an average Finnish town.
The centre has the same shops
and services as elsewhere in Finland.
The town council has
seven left wing members-
- and twenty right wing members.
- What's the population here?
- A bit over 9,000.
The population is falling
here in the country.
People are moving away?
Is it mostly young people?
Yes, and students who graduate
from the Air Force training unit.
What kind of industry
do you have here?
We have
the traditional knife industry.
It is still alive, but above all,
the weaving industry is very strong.
We have three textile mills
with 200 - 300 weavers.
- Is there much unemployment?
- Mostly in autumn and winter.
But the state and the town
provide work, mainly building work.
It's worst for the men.
- So it's the men who are unemployed?
- Yes, women work as weavers.
Men who weave at home
work alongside their wives.
- So the women here support the men?
- Yes, more or less.
Are you personally
satisfied with you lot-
- or do you want to leave as well?
No, Kauhava is a good place to live.
I retired ten years ago.
I bought a house here
and decided to stay.
Are you satisfied
with Finland as a whole?
- Is it a good country to live in?
- You can get by here if you work.
But not if you are lazy.
Would the young people in Kauhava
agree with you?
- Or do they feel different?
- Some do, of course.
But I think most of them have
a middle-class attitude-
- though
there are hippie types here, too.
You'll find them everywhere.
Have you many lazy people here?
Ten or so. They hang about by the
river in the summer drinking meths.
As far as I can see,
we conduct the town affairs-
- effectively and impartially.
We try to keep in mind-
- that we work for the town
and all the people living here.
We here in Kauhava feel-
- that at a national level affairs
are conducted more partially.
Above all, we protest the fact-
- that Helsinki dominates everything.
Is the town politically united?
There are many political groups
in the town council-
- and the elections are political.
Regardless of that,
party politics is pushed aside-
- when we work for the common good.
But Kauhava is dominated by the right.
Not really. There are only
three right-wingers in the council.
I'd say
we are dominated by the Centre.
In this respect we differ
from neighbouring towns.
The right wing is small-
- and works well with other groups.
The Typpi chemical company
created this landscape in Oulu.
This is industrial poison.
<i>Bloody hell!</i>
Democracy is only apparent
in this town, as in others.
The town has grown rather quickly.
Old systems of power are still strong.
Things are decided here at club level.
Either by the Lions,
the Rotary Club or the Finnish Club.
I don't know who decides what.
It's important in matters concerning
the town and the local companies-
- not to let the people in.
The motives for decision making
are often kept secret.
The press cannot and does not
want to break down this wall.
The press, too,
is part of the power elite.
<i>Did you know this fact</i>
<i>That in this country</i>
there are three castes?
<i>The ordinary folk slave away</i>
<i>The officials make decisions</i>
<i>And the powerful elite</i>
sits above them all
<i>Won't you join</i>
Finland's happy throng?
<i>Education, money,</i>
and connections will help
<i>Use your elbows and push ahead</i>
The National Coalition and the SDP
control the Helsinki city council.
They hold 44 of the 77 seats.
The council approves
the outcome of inter-party deals-
- but its power is illusory.
In reality the city is led by civil
servants and a few politicians:
Aura, Väyrynen, Poukka, Leskinen,
Pusa, Loimaranta, Rantala, Loppi.
The decisions are presented to the
council when it's too late for change.

The state and the towns
sacrifice millions annually-
- for literature, theatre
and the visual arts.
Theatre tickets are twice
as expensive as cinema tickets.
Still, the theatre
wouldn't survive unaided.
The cinema gets 700,000 marks.
Many filmmakers are out of work.
Production is falling.
What does the theatre mean
to Finnish people?
Does it mean anything?
I don't know if the theatre
means anything to people.
It would be nice if it did.
Is it just entertainment for them?
I recently read in our theatre
magazine what people want to see.
Most people said
operettas and comedies.
Things that help them to forget...
What does the theatre mean to you?
Is it a job or an art?
- It's my work.
- Like any other work?
I try to practise my art when I can.
Right now I'm doing <i>Coriolanus</i>
and it's like...
A play by Shakespeare.
But people want to see operettas.
Why the hell play Shakespeare
if nobody wants to see it?
- We hope people will come and see it.
- You've been hoping for fifty years.
Still you play them year after year.
I'm only asking.
The papers would complain
if we only did <i>Cactus Flower.</i>
To hell with the papers,
think about the public.
Yes, but we have to consider
the grant we get from the city.
Do you only do it for the grant?
Is the grant system?
It depends on
how many visitors we have.
Is it so that if you don't play
Shakespeare, you don't get the grant?
No, I don't quite mean that.
But this kind of play gets
more financial aid-
- than theatre for the people?
Yes and no, yes and no.
Do the popular theatres
get the same aid-
- as theatres that play Shakespeare?
Would you repeat that?
That fellow distracted me.
He's a film director.
- Is he?
- They're like that these days.
Does he want to be in the picture?
Art for the people.
Which is the more important
form of art, cinema or theatre?
- Are films art?
- Definitely.
Is ballet really necessary
in Finland?
Of course, culture is necessary
and ballet is culture.
- Why is culture necessary?
- We need to develop the mind.
It's for future generations.
Culture has always been necessary.
Is ballet more mind than muscle?
In ballet the technique comes first,
then the spirit.
All forms of dance require technique
and both mental and physical ability.
This is what I teach
in addition to technique.
I try to give a part of myself
when I dance.
But first you have to master
the technique.
- Is ballet an elitist art?
- What is an elitist art?
Art for the rich,
the upper classes.
In Finland? I don't know...
Compared to others, you mean?
Do you teach
as many working class children-
- as children from
the upper classes?
We have all classes here.
Is Finland equal when it comes to
dancing and going to see ballets?
- Can you wait a minute?
- Country folk and townsfolk?
I think we're a rather uniform people
without any great class distinctions.
Mr President, the Finnish Medallists'
Guild in token of the deep gratitude-
- for your being
a patron of the medallists' art-
- offer this medal in your honour.
It has been designed by
Raimo Heinonen for this occasion.
For the moment, this is the only copy.
The artist has portrayed-
- a president
who is both statesman and sportsman.
We believe that the medal
depicts Mr President well-
- on 3rd September 1970.
The medal has raised great interest
and, therefore, we suggest-
- that wider circles should be given
a chance to purchase this medal-
- both as a work of art
and as a memento of this day.
The Artists' Association
and the Association of Sculptors
also offer their congratulations.
- How do you become a minister?
- You just put your name down.
You have to be involved
in politics a long time.
- Then you might be lucky.
- What characteristics are required?
Well... The characteristics
you need as a politician.
- Do you need to be a climber?
- I don't think so.
But you have to be good at something.
I was Minister of the Interior first,
then Minister of Social Affairs.
Back then
I wasn't much good at anything.
I found my place as Minister of
Industry and now as Foreign Minister.
In 1966, when we last met officially-
- I felt like you had been politically
on the sideline for a while.
It started in 1958 when I resigned
as secretary of the SDP.
I had done the job for eleven years
and was getting bored.
It felt refreshing until 1963.
Then I began to feel that
our party deserved better treatment.
I wanted to do something about it.
And so I did. I reviewed my position.
Didn't you resign
partly over foreign policy?
Of course.
In the late 40's and early 50's-
- our party policy
was to combat communism.
- And you agreed with that?
- Yes, I did.
I believed it was
the only possible course for SDP-
- until I realised that opposition
could not be the main goal.
One must be for something,
take a positive course.
- Now that you're in power...
- Am I?
What chance has the man in the street
to influence your work-
- to control government actions?
The opportunities are few,
to tell the truth.
They can influence
through the party and the press-
- and partly the bureaucracy.
It depends on the individual.
If he's an active party member,
he has more influence-
- than an ordinary man in the street.
- So the ordinary man can only vote?
- In reality, yes.
A hundred marks is a lot of money
for you and me.
I gave him hundred marks and asked
him to go and buy me some booze.
The bastard didn't come back.
It wasn't my last money but...
- But almost?
- I'll fix the bastard...
Guess what I have in my pocket.
I'm not saying, but that guy...
I don't know if he's local or not.
A young guy.
- Is Finland a fucking awful place?
- In some ways it is.
- Do Finns pull stunts like this?
- Everything is fucking awful.
It's not so fucking awful abroad
but in Finland it is too.
I'm a sailor.
I've been to South America.
If I catch the goddamn bastard,
I'll shoot him.
You can bet on that, damn it!
Bloody hell! I'll skin him.
I'll teach him to run.
I'll show him some cha cha cha.
Get it?
- What's the best place here?
- The Grand Hotel.
- Can we get in there?
- Sure you can!
- Without a tie?
- Fuck the tie. It's Wednesday night.
- Are there any women there?
- Sure.
The porter will bring them
up to the rooms.
The Grand Hotel is the place.
Can you get in
anywhere else without a tie?
- Tirra is a good place.
- Are there any women there?
- No!
- There are lots of good places here.
- The Grand Hotel is the best.
- No, it's not.
- What's better then?
- The Glass Palace.
- What's that?
- The former Glass Palace.
The Palace Restaurant
is fully licensed.
- Do you get women there?
- Sure.
- Do you have to pay them?
- Of course.
- Cash or what?
- No, just buy them a drink.
- Do you want to try?
- Do you?
Two people found happiness in Lahti.
A teenaged girl and...
No, I'm from Turku.
- May I come with you?
- Why not.
Haven't you got anywhere to live
as you want to stay all night?
- None of your business.
- Don't ask stupid questions.
You've got a handsome beard.
Why did you come here?
You look so nice-
- and so does your friend.
You don't look the type for this kind
of dump with lousy people.
- Don't you like it here?
- No. Do you come here often?
- No, I don't come to Lahti so often.
- I've never been here before.
As soon as I got here,
they bought me some booze.
- Say it straight out.
- He bought it.
You asked me to join you, so I did.
- What if we take you with us?
- What do you say to that?
- I'm from Turku.
- I want to make love to you.
- Do you want to make love to me?
- Yes.
All night?
- Do you like making love?
- Yes, why wouldn't I?
Why do you like making love?
Why do you like it or don't like it?
If you like it, why do you like it?
If you don't like it,
why don't you like it?
Are you a philosopher? When
you make love, don't you ever worry-
- that it might be sinful?
- Or that people might talk?
- No.
- Why not?
- Why should I worry?
If I make love to somebody-
- I do it because I want to do it-
- with my whole body and soul.
Everything within me wants it.
- I want you.
- Do you want all of us?
We'll leave you two alone now.
Do you earn your living
by making love, Tupu?
We can give you a hundred marks.
- You give me a hundred?
- Yes.
How much do you want for all of us?
If it's going to be all of you,
then I want two hundred.
We'll give you two hundred.
It's just that... I have to pay
the rent before Christmas.
Of course.
If you take your bra off now, the
money will fall. Put it in your bag.
- Don't you want to make love to me?
- I do.
You do? Why don't you then?
- Don't you tease me.
- But you want it.
- Don't tease me.
- You want it.
Don't you want it?
Don't you?
Don't tease me.
HELLO, MUM!
- Stop it, please.
- Why?
Please, stop it.
Are you healthy?
Are you healthy?
I'll use a condom
to avoid any accidents-
- healthwise and otherwise.
- What are you laughing at?
- He's filming us.
- Never mind that.
- It just makes me laugh.
I can't do this
with him filming there.
Now you know
how hard it is to be a film star.
This is like acting
with the camera there.
Piss off with that microphone.
I'm out of work.
I just go round the cafes and bars.
- I enjoy living in Oulu.
- What's your line of work?
- I'm a carpenter.
- Have you got any training for that?
I've got the training and all
but there is no work at the moment.
- Can't you get a job in the south?
- I've got job offers from the south.
You've got to pay your own fare
and there's nowhere to live.
- What do you do now then?
- I go drinking and dancing.
- But that costs money?
- I get dole money.
- Couldn't you use that to go south?
- But there's nowhere to live there.
I work in a warehouse.
- What's happened to you?
- I got beaten up on Saturday.
- Why?
- Four or five of us were drinking.
- And they beat you up?
- Yes.
- Didn't you fight back?
- There were too many of them.
- How did you get to the hospital?
- I called an ambulance.
And it brought you here?
What are you going to do next?
I thought about taking this to court
but it's difficult to find witnesses.
- How much do you earn?
- I'm not working at the moment.
- How much did you earn?
- About 500 a month.
- Would you emigrate for better pay?
- Gladly.
- Where to?
- To Sweden.
- Have you tried?
- I've asked around a bit.
But nothing came of it.
- Have you got any qualifications?
- I've been to secondary school.
- I dropped out.
- Do you know any languages?
Just a bit of English and that...
- Where does you family live?
- In Kotka.
I live together with my old man.
- What are you going to do now?
- After this?
I'm thinking of getting drunk.

I've worked with horses, you see.
I get the state pension
but it's not enough.
Have you had any trouble
with other Finns?
Yes.
Some are better, they talk to us.
Others don't say a word to us gypsies.
- Do they still think you're thieves?
- Maybe a little, I don't know.
It's racism. We are people, too.
- How does the racism show?
- Sorry, what?
- How does it show?
- They think they're better than us.
- The locals or others, too?
- Others, too.
- People here in Nurmes.
- Have you travelled around much?
They tell us to go to the basement
and we still get nothing.
- Let him talk.
- That's all right.
I haven't travelled that much,
just a little.
Things are different abroad.
In Sweden and other countries
we are more equal.
There gypsies have some human dignity.
- But not here?
- They're a grim lot here.
In other countries,
when it comes to us gypsies...
If you buy a house,
it improves your life.
Nothing improves here.
Here they just discriminate
against us, look down upon us.
- Where do you work here?
- At the Forest Research Institute.
- Do you earn enough money?
- Not really.
- What's your job there?
- I do bits of road work.
- What kind of work is it exactly?
- It varies, mainly clearing.
How much do you earn a month?
I'm paid 3.96 an hour.
- Is life good in Finland?
- No, it's not.
- Not for a working man.
- Why is that?
The wages are poor.
You barely manage to survive.
- Just barely?
- Yes.
Child care should be better organised,
and the housing.
- How do you mean?
- Housing should be available.
We've been looking for a flat
for over a year now.
I can't afford the rent deposit
and the expensive rent.
So you can live here
at the mother-and-child home?
No,
I've lived here for two years now.
I should have left already
but I can't find a flat.
You're studying now and
trying to improve your lot in life.
How far can a woman get
in our society?
- As far as she wants.
- You believe women are equal to men?
- Yes, nowadays.
- It depends on the individual?
If you do nothing, you get nothing.
But in practice
women don't get as far as men?
Not yet, but they will.
- Will women do better than men?
- I don't know.
- Are men paid more?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Men are valued a bit too highly.
You're a telephonist. Do you know
any male telephonists?
- No, I don't.
- Why don't men work as telephonists?
I don't know...
The pay is rather poor, of course.
They're probably not interested.
The basic evil of capitalism is-
- the conflict between social
production and private ownership-
- which leads to a conflict
between labour and capital-
- to the exploitation of labour
by the capitalists.
How can you change it-
- when even your Communist Party-
- cannot agree on its goals?
We don't believing in changing
the society in one winter.
It's a long process-
- of showing the need
for basic renewal in society.
At the same time we defend
the classes we represent.
What if the majority are against you?
It's no secret that the majority
are against a socialist society-
- but it doesn't prevent socialists
from working to that end.
So you believe you can achieve
even some of your goals-
- despite the majority?
We can establish socialism
with the majority support.
The communists do not have
special goals-
- we just have the common goals
of the working classes-
- to fight capitalism together.
Won't the result be a compromise?
In the decisive class struggle
there can be no compromise-
- only the struggle
between the classes.
Everyday politics, of course,
is a compromise.
But in the struggle where
the basis of society is decided-
- between capitalism and socialism,
in that battle there is no compromise.
Now we live under a bourgeois system,
which we are seeking to change.
<i>Here are poverty and need</i>
<i>And great inequality</i>
<i>Ignorance and want</i>
<i>In the depths of the country</i>
<i>This society must be changed</i>
<i>And change it together we can</i>
<i>Do something</i>
<i>Do something small</i>
<i>Do something big</i>
<i>But do something</i>
<i>Think carefully about what you hear</i>
<i>Don't always believe</i>
your eyes and ears
<i>Don't be content with your lot</i>
<i>Remember who you are</i>
and start to work
<i>Do something</i>
<i>Do something small</i>
<i>Do something big</i>
<i>But do something</i>
<i>Do something</i>
<i>Do something small</i>
<i>Do something big</i>
<i>But do something</i>
