That's my train.
Wait! Wait!
Shit. Ow.
Wake up, Jack.
Have you seen Francis?
Hello, Peter.
- Good afternoon. Whitman?
- Yeah, that's us.
May I see your tickets, please?
Thanks.
There's no smoking, please.
Welcome aboard.
Sweet lime?
- Sure, I'll have one.
- Yes, please.
Sounds good.
Let's go get a drink
and smoke a cigarette.
I want to start by thanking you both
for being here.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Thank you.
You're the two most important people
in the world to me.
I've never said that before, but it's true,
and I want you both to know it.
- I love you, Peter.
- Thank you.
- I love you, Jack.
- I love you too.
How did it get to this?
Why haven't we spoken in a year?
Let's make an agreement.
- To do what?
- Okay.
I want us to become brothers again
like we used to be...
and for us to find ourselves
and bond with each other.
Can we agree to that?
- Okay.
- Yeah.
I want us to make this trip
a spiritual journey...
where each of us seek the unknown
and we learn about it.
Can we agree to that?
- Sure.
- I guess so.
I want us to be completely open
and say yes to everything...
even if it's shocking and painful.
Can we agree to that?
Now, I had Brendan make us an itinerary.
- Who's Brendan?
- My new assistant.
He's going to place an updated schedule
under our doors every morning...
of all the spiritual places and temples
that we need to see...
and expedite hotels and transportation
and everything.
How's he going to do that?
I had him bring a printer
and a laminating machine.
- Where is he?
- In a way, it actually doesn't matter.
He's in a different compartment
on another part of the train...
but we never see him... ever.
That's more or less it.
Three, please.
- Does that sound okay to you?
- It sounds good, sure.
- Yeah, it sounds good.
- Do you have any questions?
- I do.
- Okay. Go ahead.
What happened to your face?
I only remember certain details...
but from what I've been able
to reconstruct...
it was raining, I was going about
50 miles an hour as I went into a corner...
did some wrong steering,
wheels went out from me...
and I suddenly skidded off the road...
slammed into a ditch
and got catapulted 50 feet through the air.
Uh, little particles of glass and debris
were stinging my face as I flew.
And for a second,
there was just total silence.
Just.
Then bam, the bike crashed to the ground,
exploded and caught on fire...
and I smashed on the side of a hill
with my face.
I was driving home.
I live alone right now.
Anyway, two joggers ran up
and started digging out all the dirt...
that was jammed inside my mouth
and my nose and my ears.
My brain had stopped,
my heart had stopped...
so technically I was dead at this point.
They did all the procedures exactly right,
as a result of which I'm still alive.
- Boy.
- Wow.
The first thing I thought of when I woke up
was, "I wish Peter and Jack were here."
- Have you heard anything from Mom?
- No.
- Have you?
- No.
Me neither.
Fuck.
- What's that?
- Some kind of Indian muscle relaxer.
I got it at the pharmacy
next to the train station.
- What's that?
- You don't need a prescription here.
A type of Indian flu medicine.
It's got a tranquilizer in it.
- What's that?
- Strongest Indian painkiller you can get.
It's for my face.
Uh, be careful with that.
You only want to take one drop.
Shh.
I also lost a tooth.
You want to read a short story
I wrote in France?
- How long is it?
- What?
- How long is it?
- How long is it? Never mind. Forget it.
You can save it till after dinner.
You know, maybe right before whenever
you're about to take out your tooth...
you should say something like, "Please forgive
this," because it's actually, It's kind of...
Can you... Can you back away a little?
You just spit in my eye.
When was the last time
you were in America, by the way?
I don't know. The funeral.
In other words, a year?
I have to tell you, I support
this relationship not working out.
May I take your order, please?
Let's see. Do we want meat or fish?
I'm going to have the chicken.
Jack, you want to try the fish?
I bet that's delicious.
And, Peter, the lamb?
A chicken, a fish and a lamb?
How does that sound?
And who wants a soup?
Raise your hand.
- Are those Dad's glasses?
- Yeah.
You still have his prescription in here.
How can you see in these?
- Three soups.
- Soup. Yes.
Could you not order for me, please?
- What?
- Order for yourself.
What part are you on?
Nothing. It reminded me
of something not related to it.
How's Alice?
She's fine.
She actually started this company
where she makes these little clay pots.
They're quite popular.
- We sent you one.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Oh, thank you.
I want that stewardess.
These... These Germans are bothering me.
Ladies! Please, keep it down.
Lower your voices. Thank you.
Did I raise us? Kind of?
Hang on. I'm going to ask this guy
if he can get me a power adapter.
She's pregnant. Alice.
- Really? You're kidding.
- No.
- Uh, how long?
- Seven and a half months.
It's... It's... So it's going to be born
in, like, six weeks or something.
I think so, yeah.
I'm trying not to get
too caught up in it right now.
Don't tell Francis.
Brendan got the wrong voltage.
Your soup, sir.
Please forgive this.
Hmm.
Is it supposed to be sad?
I think so.
Well, I'm not too crazy about the part
where I start screaming at the mechanic.
- That never happened.
- The characters are all fictional.
May I take your dessert order, sir?
Let's see. Do we want sweets or fruit?
I'm going to have the pudding.
Jack, you want to try the cake?
And, Peter, what looks good to you?
The cookies?
- He's going to order for himself.
- The cookies.
Excuse me. I'm...
Has he been rooting around
and taking things?
Maybe. I think he's still in mourning.
Well, I probably am, too, but there's something
kind of unethical about it, isn't there?
Legally, those glasses belong
to all three of us.
I'm going to take this bed, because
I'm the oldest and my ankle's fractured.
Peter, you don't mind climbing a ladder,
as I recall...
so why don't you set up shop topside?
And, Jack, you're a little
bit of a lone wolf.
Why don't you bunk out next door?
How does that sound?
- Oh, sorry. I was...
- Stand up.
- Brendan, this is Jack.
- Good evening.
- And this is Peter.
- Hello, Brendan.
- Nice to meet you.
- Let's update me.
- How's everything going back there?
- Pretty good.
- What does that mean?
- I never heard back.
So try again.
What are you waiting for?
- Well, I left a message.
- Why are you smiling?
What do you think he looks like
under all that tape and everything?
Brendan, what did I tell you?
Well, I don't know about his face, but I
think his brain might be pretty traumatized.
Damn it!
Come down to this spot over here.
Call her again right now and keep calling
every 10 minutes until you get through.
- Okay.
- This is urgent. We're almost there.
- Okay.
- And once again, so we're explicitly clear...
I don't want you to mention this
or discuss it with anyone.
- In other words, it's a surprise.
- Okay.
- Did you find me a power adapter?
- Not yet.
How long are you going to stay here?
What do you mean?
He said till the end of the month.
Uh huh.
Why do you ask that?
I'm just trying to know
so I can figure out my plans.
- What plans?
- I don't know yet.
Anyways, I've got my own ticket,
just in case. Don't tell Francis.
Well, I'm not going to stay here
with just me and him.
Is that one of Alice's pots?
Oh. We should order some more of these.
- I'll tell Brendan.
- Okay.
He has this disease
where his head is shaved...
except he doesn't have to shave it because
he can't grow any hair in the first place.
Don't talk about it around him though.
It might offend him.
Are these Dad's keys?
- Yeah.
- You've got his car keys too.
Where's those nuts at?
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
Good evening, Mr. Whitman.
How can I help you?
Is it possible for us to get some more
of those Savoury Snacks, please?
Of course.
Can I offer you anything else?
- Um, I don't think so.
- I'll be right back.
I forgot something.
Do you want to smoke a cigarette with me
in the bathroom?
You're crazy.
What's your name?
Jack. What's yours?
Rita.
You're beautiful.
Don't come into me.
Jack's got his own return ticket.
He says he might leave early.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't tell him I told you.
Brendan's got all the tickets.
There's a whole itinerary.
Where's he going?
Air Italiano? What the fuck is this?
I'm keeping his passport.
In fact, give me yours too.
I want to keep all the passports
so nothing happens to them.
- I'm keeping mine.
- No.
I want to keep them all together.
Why are you standing there?
I'm waiting for you.
Mr. Whitman, the whole point of us coming out
separately is so no one sees us together.
- Jack.
- Jack.
Right. I get it. Okay. Good night then.
Go back to your compartment.
Move over, please.
Where are the Savoury Snacks?
Huh?
Did you just fuck that Indian girl?
What?
Sweet Lime.
Of course not. I went for a walk.
Something just happened.
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Who's he talking to?
No one. He's got the code
to his ex-girlfriend's answering machine...
and he's checking her messages.
What? When... When did he
confide that to you?
Just now.
Why am I not a part of this?
I've never liked that girl.
Me neither.
Anyway, I never trusted her.
I don't feel good about myself.
Okay. Let's make another agreement.
On the spiritual journey, it's crucial
that we don't splinter into factions...
or not include somebody who has advice
and may know better.
- Can we agree to that?
- Okay.
- What'd you find out?
- Nothing.
Good.
She put this in my suitcase.
- Is that her?
- Mmm, that's her.
How did she gain access
to your personal belongings?
She came to see me in France for 24 hours.
- Could she be gaslighting you?
- What's gaslighting?
Okay, hang on a second.
Let's make another agreement.
From now on, if you want to talk to her
or check her messages...
you speak to us first,
day or night, any time.
Can you agree to that?
I think we should destroy that.
Jesus!
Okay. All right.
Let's check the itinerary.
Give me a little light.
Okay, here we go.
Train stops first thing tomorrow morning
for an hour and 45 minutes...
which is just enough time for a quick visit
to Temple of a Thousand Bulls...
probably one of the most spiritual places
in the entire world.
Wow.
Power adapters!
- Can I get a power adapter?
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Do you have a power adapter?
- No, no. No power adapter. Use battery.
- No? I mean, I can't have one?
- Wow.
Hey, do you have these in, uh, say,
a 10 and a half medium? Like, uh...
- These all size. Take off shoes and try.
- Yeah, like that. That's good.
Pepper spray.
What ingredients does this have in it?
- I don't want to kill anybody or anything.
- No, no, not for killing.
- Uh, spray in face.
- Okay. Spray in face.
Spray in face.
Most rare. From desert. Very poisonous.
How much you want for him?
This is incredible!
Ring it.
Take some of these rupees and put them
on this thing in front of the deity here.
Is that my belt?
- Can I borrow it?
- No, not right now.
I was looking for that earlier.
Ask first.
- Next time.
- All right.
Where's my passport?
I got pickpocketed.
My passport got stolen.
Calm down. It's not stolen.
- No. Yes, it is. It's gone.
- No, it's not. I have it.
I'll be right back.
- You stole my passport?
- Peter, where are you going?
I'm going to go pray at a different thing.
- I hear ear you're leaving early.
- What are you talking about?
- I thought we made an agreement.
- That's why you stole my passport?
Well, no, but I think we have a chance to make
this kind of a life-changing experience...
and I think we need it.
In other words, I don't want you to leave.
- He's going to have a kid in six weeks.
- Who?
Him. Rubby. He doesn't want you to know.
- "Rubby"?
- Yeah, you know, Rubby.
Yeah.
Why doesn't he want me to know?
Because we don't trust each other.
Wow. Right?
- Great. Thanks.
- Amazing.
Let's get a shoeshine.
Oh. Hit it.
Hey. Hey, come back here!
- What?
- The kid just left...
- Who?
- He just... Get him!
- He left his shoeshine kit.
- He...
Well, now he can pay for this whole
building. Those are $3,000 loafers!
- Yeah, but he only got one of them.
- Yeah, but that's...
We're in an emergency here.
I got my face smashed in,
Jack's heart's been ripped to shreds...
and Rubby's having a child!
- Let's get into it!
- You told him?
It's okay. Okay?
That's what we're here for,
to start trusting each other.
I don't get it, by the way.
Why aren't we celebrating?
Because I don't want to talk about it.
Well, why not?
I guess because I always expected
eventually I'll get divorced.
So having children
really wasn't part of my plan.
Okay. But you're never going to
do better than Alice.
- And what's the point in getting married...
- Why'd you expect to get divorced?
I don't know. I love Alice.
Maybe it relates to how we were raised.
I was going to save this
for later in the itinerary...
but I think it's time.
There's a ceremony I want us to do where
we each take one of these peacock feathers.
We're going to go off into the wilderness
and meditate for...
Damn it, I gave them to Brendan.
That's all right.
We'll do it after the next stop.
- Those guys are laughing at us.
- Where?
I love it here.
These people are beautiful.
They're playing cricket with a tennis ball.
Hello. How do you do?
Hello.
It's great.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's so well-written.
You remember everything so clearly.
Peter getting all frantic getting the
car started, you with the suitcase.
The characters are all fictional.
Well, anyway, I think it's the best thing
you've ever written.
Thank you.
Here are the peacock feathers,
plus some instructions from the guru.
- What's in that box?
- He bought a snake.
- It's got a skull and crossbones on it.
- Let's update me.
Anything?
- She got the message, yeah.
- And?
- What? That's it.
- That's it?
She got the message.
You're satisfied with that?
- Well, she knows you're coming.
- Does she want to see us?
But she's your mother.
Happy birthday from last year.
I can't accept this.
It's too valuable.
It's got one wrong initial,
but you can paint over it.
It's from me and Jack.
Yes?
- Would you like tea?
- Okay.
Thank you.
I've got to get off this train.
What's her name again?
Rita.
- Snake isn't in the...
- What'd you say?
There's a hole in it. He escaped.
No, he didn't.
How?
- Jesus Christ.
- There he is!
Get him.
Now you... Now you believe me, assholes?
We think a snake might've gotten on board!
Don't go in there, Rita!
You got him!
I'm kicking you off at the next station.
Please don't do that. We're very sorry.
It won't happen again.
I know it won't.
- What's that smell?
- Voltaire #6.
- Do you have a prescription for these?
- Prescription?
I almost died.
Give me a second.
That animal's deadly poisonous,
and you brought him onto my train.
We didn't know. It was an accident.
We're just trying to experience something.
It's very important to us.
You're confined to your compartment
until further notice.
Is our snake getting confiscated?
Do you think it's working?
Do we feel something?
- I hope so.
- It's got to.
Do you trust me?
Where are we?
Brendan, what's going on?
I don't know.
I guess the train's lost.
- What'd he say?
- He says the train's lost.
How can a train be lost?
It's on rails.
Apparently we took a wrong turn
at some point last night.
- That's crazy.
- How far off course are we?
Nobody knows.
We haven't located us yet.
- What'd you just say?
- What?
- What you just said. Say it again.
- We haven't located us yet.
Ah! Is that symbolic?
"We haven't located us... yet."
- Where's those feathers at?
- In the envelope I gave you this morning.
Meet me on top of that thing out there.
The guru told me when the moon turns...
Do you trust me?
I hired a private detective
to track down Mom.
She's living in a convent
in the foothills of the Himalayas.
We'll be there in six days.
How is that possible?
I guess she became a nun, apparently.
You know what she's like.
- A nun?
- Apparently.
- Did you talk to her?
- No, I didn't.
- Does she know we're coming?
- I think so.
How do you know she wants to see us?
She probably doesn't.
But maybe she does.
Why didn't you tell us sooner?
Because I'm trying to protect you
from all the painful emotions...
this is probably going to stir up.
Well, aren't you kind of
doing that right now?
Yeah. I'm scared too.
She's obviously suffered
some kind of mental collapse...
and we've got to go get her
and bring her back home.
Actually, it's in the itinerary,
but I put it under T.B.D.
Why are you laughing?
You didn't tell us because we never
would've come here if we knew about it.
I'm going to hold this
in for a little while.
You going to drink
that whole bottle of cough medicine?
That's a dumb way to get loaded.
- Let's look at the itinerary.
- Fuck the itinerary.
You know, I think I'm going to have to
get that belt back after all...
because it cost me $6,000,
and it was made special for me.
- We'll get you a different present.
- I don't think so.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means there's been
too much Indian giving over the years.
These guys are driving me crazy. Is there
an empty compartment I can move into?
No, there isn't. We're fully booked.
I really want to kiss you right now.
Can I?
- No.
- No?
But we already... did it. I don't...
- I have a boyfriend.
- You do?
Actually, I just broke up with him.
Or I'm about to.
I really need someone
to talk to right now...
and I feel like you might be
very important to me in my life.
All right.
What did I tell you?
Get back in your room.
- What's happening?
- What do you mean?
- I rang the bell.
- I'll be right there.
Is that Dad's razor?
- Yeah.
- Can I say something?
What?
You don't have permission to take his
property that belongs to all of us...
and use it for yourself as if it's yours.
Jack agrees with that. Right, Jack?
Plus, Dad would have hated it.
- Why?
- That's my opinion. I knew him well.
- That's a terrible thing to say.
- Well, I don't mean it to be.
I just don't want you to get the feeling that
you're better friends with him than we are...
or something weird like that.
And also, you can't leave your wife
just because she's pregnant.
Jack agrees with that too. Right, Jack?
- Stop including me.
- I was his favorite.
He told me that with blood all over him,
laying in the street, right before he died.
How is that supposed to make us feel?
I want my passport back.
- Francis?
- Yeah?
Here's your belt.
Fuck. Stop!
Oh!
- You don't love me!
- Yes, I do!
I love you, too, but I'm going to
mace you in the face! Stop!
- I had to do it!
- Jack, come back! Now, you wait... just...
Help me wash it off.
Stop including me!
- I'll find us a hotel.
- The next train's in 24 hours.
This just came in.
Why are your eyes all red?
Why is your head so bald?
Because I have alopecia.
Oh, yeah. That's like albino, right?
Not really.
Jack maced us.
Was I just mean to Brendan?
He's not coming back. He just quit.
He did, didn't he?
- Can we at least get our snake back?
- It's dead.
You killed him?
Your fake tooth's gone.
Fuck.
What did you say?
Shame on you!
Did you get maced too?
No, I'm crying.
What's wrong with you?
Let me think about that.
I'll tell you the next time I see you.
Sure. Tell me then.
Thanks for using me.
You're welcome.
Good-bye, Rita.
So long, Sweet Lime!
"Dear boys"
<i>Bad timing. This morning I received
the details of your travel plans...</i>
<i>in a document sent to me
from a man named Brendan.</i>
<i>Unfortunately, I cannot receive you now.</i>
<i>A neighboring village requires our
urgent assistance due to an emergency...</i>
<i>not to mention the recent arrival
of a man-eating tiger in the region.</i>
<i>I suggest you come in the spring
when you'll be safe with me.</i>
<i>You must know how sad I am
to experience this long separation.</i>
<i>I hope you'll eventually understand
and forgive me.</i>
<i>God bless you and keep you
with Mary's benevolent guidance...</i>
<i>and the light of Christ's enduring grace.</i>
<i>All my love,
your mother, Sister Patricia Whitman.</i>
That sounds like bullshit to me.
- Me too.
- Obviously.
She's trying to sell us a vacuum cleaner.
I'm sorry.
- Me too.
- I wasn't trying to aim for your face.
It doesn't matter.
It's already demolished.
Let's just go home.
She doesn't want to see us anyway.
You don't think so?
Not even on some primordial level?
No.
She's been disappearing all our lives.
We weren't raised
to be treated like that.
It's just not done.
Maybe this is how it's supposed to happen.
It could all be part of it.
Maybe this is where
the spiritual journey ends.
You read the instructions, right?
Okay, let's do it.
- I'm going to go over here.
- Yeah. That's good. Get on the rock, yeah.
- Peter, you got... Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah.
- Ah! Oh!
- Zsa-loh!
- Okay, that's it.
- That's it? Okay.
All right.
Which direction did yours go?
- What do you mean?
- Your feathers.
- Mine blew towards the mountains.
- That's not right.
- It's not supposed to get blown away.
- You're supposed to blow on it...
and then bury it.
I didn't get that. I still have mine.
You guys didn't do it right.
I asked you if you read the instructions.
You did it wrong.
I tried my hardest.
I don't know what else to do.
I don't think Dad would've hated it.
Did he really say you were his favorite?
I don't know.
I could barely understand him.
He wasn't really breathing.
I wonder if the three of us
could have been friends in real life.
Not as brothers, but as people.
Well, we probably would've had
a better chance, I guess.
Let's make another agreement. We'll all come
back here in the spring when the flowers...
We're never coming back here.
Let's just find an airport
and go our separate ways.
Wouldn't it sound great if you could hear a
train going by off in the distance right now?
- Not really.
- Probably be annoying.
Look at these assholes.
That's going to tip over.
Go!
Get the little one.
Francis!
Grab him.
Don't let go of me.
Pull. He's all tangled up.
Here you go.
- Hold on! Whoa, whoa! Oh...
- Hang on. Hang on. I got you.
I can't get him out.
Whoa!
Peter!
He's all bloody!
- He's dead. He's dead.
- He's dead?
- The rocks killed him.
- You're bleeding like crazy.
- Peter, you okay?
- I didn't save mine.
What's his name?
- Papa!
- Hey.
Papa!
Hey!
Thank you.
Can you explain that I almost had him?
I lost him when we went off the rocks.
He was too slippery.
I had him the whole rest of the time.
I want them to know that.
What are you doing in this place?
Well, originally, I guess we came here
on a spiritual journey...
but that didn't really pan out.
We're invited to the funeral.
Okay.
I can't believe you just said that.
- Why not? It's the truth.
- He didn't really mean it.
I think you're all equally grief-stricken.
Let's just leave it at that.
- When does Mom get in?
- She's going straight there from the airport.
- I want to pick up the car.
- We're already late.
- Tell the driver to take a right.
- We don't have time.
- Let's do this later.
- No. I want to get it now.
Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
Uh, we're going to need
to make a stop first at this address.
Go ahead.
I'll be right behind you.
I think we should wait for you.
Why?
Francis.
Tell them we'll be there in five minutes.
Hey. Hey.
- Hey.
- Yeah.
We're here to pick up
Mr. Whitman's car.
No, uh, Mr. Whitman's car is not ready.
- What do you mean it's not ready?
- No, we're waiting for a... a part.
- A part?
- Yeah.
- Uh, I left a message with his secretary.
- No, no, no. That's crazy.
This car's been here for three months.
He can't wait any longer.
He'll have to wait another week.
Uh, I left a message.
Yeah, he didn't get the message.
Mr. Whitman is dead. You understand?
- Jimmy Whitman?
- Yeah.
- Oh. What happened to him?
- He got hit by a taxi.
- And it killed him?
- Yeah.
His change was scattered
all over 72nd Street.
Oh, you're his sons.
Right. And we're going to take this car...
to his funeral, which we're late for
right now.
- Where are the keys?
- Peter, we'll come back later and get the car.
It's not ready. Right?
It's not ready!
The battery's dead... too.
There it is. That's the other one.
We found it.
We're still waiting for a part
to come in from Stuttgart.
- Where's a battery charger?
- What are you doing?
- This one's mine.
- No, it's not.
We need to take it home and enter
it in the inventory along with the...
I'm taking this suitcase.
You going somewhere?
I don't know.
Where's the goddamn battery charger?
Ah. Aha!
- I guess he didn't read my book in time.
- What do you mean? In time for what?
- The envelope's never been opened.
- Oh, you mean when he was still alive.
Phone call for a Francis Whitman.
- Hello.
<i>- They want to start.</i>
Send the car back for us.
The battery's dead.
<i>They can only wait 10 minutes.
There's another service after us.</i>
Okay. Well, we might not make it then.
I guess just...
tell them to go fuck themselves.
<i>Hold the line.</i>
<i>No, you're going to start when they
get here, not one second before.</i>
<i>Is that perfectly clear? Is that
perfectly clear? Try to be quick.</i>
- Okay.
<i>- Wait a second.</i>
- Yes?
<i>- I spoke to your mother.</i>
<i>She's not coming.
She didn't get on the plane.</i>
- Why not?
<i>- I don't know. I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Will you tell Peter and Jack,
so they don't expect to see her?</i>
- Yeah.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
Thanks, Alice.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Put it in second!
Put it in second!
Pop it!
Watch it, asshole!
- What do you want?
- Are you kidding me?
- Fuck, no.
- You get back in your car right now.
Get back in that car!
This isn't going to work.
Let's put the cover back on it.
Let's go.
Come on. Steer it in.
Let's go.
- Who called?
- Alice.
- What'd she say?
- They're waiting.
Mom there?
Not yet.
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Help him up.
You okay?
Let me help you.
Whitman.
The flight boards in 25 minutes.
Let's set aside the next 10 minutes
to use as free time.
Do a little shopping, have a snack,
make a phone call.
And then we'll meet in the bathroom
next to that statue over there...
about a quarter after.
Get cleaned up, brush your teeth,
have a shave or what have you...
and in our last five minutes we'll sit
quietly in that little shrine over there...
say a prayer and think about everything
we've been through.
<i>Flight 45 to Mumbai...</i>
<i>with continuing service
to Frankfurt and points west...</i>
- Three, please.
<i>- Please stand by for further information.</i>
I love the way this country smells.
I'll never forget it.
It's kind of spicy.
Who's he talking to?
I think he's trying to rehire Brendan.
He said he's going to offer him a 50% raise
plus some medical benefits...
to help with his albino disease
or whatever it's called.
How'd it go?
He's going to think about it.
He's got to get hired back...
because otherwise
I'm probably just a bad person.
And in some ways
I feel like Brendan might be my...
friend maybe.
I'll be right back.
He didn't really kill our snake, did he?
I mean, it's got to be against his religion. I...
I bet he just... sent him out into the desert...
which is actually closer
to his natural habitat.
Who's he talking to?
Probably checking
his ex-girlfriend's messages again.
I thought we made an agreement.
Why didn't you stop him?
- What'd you find out this time?
- She's going to meet me in Italy.
- Oh, man, that's terrible.
- I know.
I'll be right back.
Let's look at the itinerary.
<i>Flight 45 to Mumbai...</i>
<i>with continuing service
to Frankfurt and points west...</i>
<i>has been detained by 15 minutes.</i>
<i>Please stand by for further information.</i>
Is that from Sweet Lime?
- Who's he talking to?
- I didn't say that. I didn't want...
Hello?
Alice, I guess.
- It's a boy.
- It got born already?
It's going to be a boy.
She had a... somnogram or something.
- It's a boy?
- That's incredible!
- Wow.
- Yeah.
Why were you yelling?
She's angry because I didn't tell her
I was coming here.
- Ever? Until just now?
- Yeah.
But I explained everything.
It's actually kind of lucky,
because... I got this vest.
It could work with either one,
but I think it's better for a man.
Here. He can inherit this.
It's from me and Jack.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Can I use those scissors?
I guess I've still got
some more healing to do.
You're getting there though.
Anyway, it's definitely going to add
a lot of character to you.
What should we pray for now?
Didn't you get my letter?
I told you to come back in the spring.
- Should we go?
- Of course not.
Oh, welcome, my beautiful boys.
Francie. Peter. Little Jack.
What happened to your face?
I smashed into a hill on purpose
on my motorcycle.
I'm sorry to hear that.
There are so many things we don't know
about each other, aren't there?
Who's this?
That's Oberoi. He got us here.
Wait a second.
What are you saying to him?
I'm telling him to lock up your horses.
There's a tiger.
Really? We thought that was bullshit.
You call that bullshit?
He ate one of the sister's brothers.
I'm not kidding.
What do we want for breakfast?
Jack, you'll like the porridge.
Peter, fresh mango.
And corn flakes for you, Francie.
Now, who wants scrambled eggs?
Raise your hand.
What's on fire in that
hideous little flowerpot?
Alice made that.
Oh, it's darling.
Tell her I said so.
- Okay. You want one?
- Of course I do.
- Mom?
- Uh huh?
There's one last thing.
I want to tell you about my son.
- What son?
- The one I'm going to have next month.
- Well, you should be with Alice.
- You should've been at Dad's funeral.
So that's why you came here.
We came here because we miss you.
I miss you too.
But why didn't you come to Dad's funeral?
Because I didn't want to.
See, what... Why are we talking this way?
What's wrong with us?
We should be celebrating.
- What are you doing here?
- I live here. These people need me.
What about us?
You're talking to her.
You're talking to someone else.
You're not talking to me.
I don't know the answers to these
questions, and I don't see myself this way.
Listen.
I'm sorry we lost your father.
We'll never get over it,
but it's okay.
There are greater forces at work.
Yes, the past happened.
But it's over, isn't it?
Not for us.
I told you not to come here.
Maybe we could express
ourselves more fully...
if we say it without words.
Should we try that?
All right. Let's make an agreement.
We'll get an early start
tomorrow morning...
and try to enjoy each other's company
here in this beautiful place.
We'll stop feeling sorry for ourselves.
It's not very attractive.
We'll make our plans for the future.
Can we agree to that?
Sure.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
To be continued.
- Good morning.
- She's gone.
- What?
- She's gone.
I was still asleep,
but Oberoi saw her go.
- Peter.
- What?
- She's gone.
- Who?
She's gone?
Where?
They couldn't say.
They just said she goes away sometimes.
She left our breakfast in the doorway.
Whoo!
Zip!
Shoo!
I'm working on a new short story.
I wrote the ending,
but I don't know how it starts.
Read us what you got.
"'Whatever happens in
the end, she said..."
"'I don't want to lose you as my friend."
"He looked into her eyes. I promise I will
never be your friend, no matter what, ever."
"Her voice cracked. If we fuck, I'm
going to feel like shit tomorrow."
"'That's okay with me, he said."
"He lifted her shirt over her head.
I love you, she said."
"'I never hurt you on purpose.
He nodded."
"I don't care.
He would not be going to Italy."
- That sound okay?
- Yeah.
It's hard for me to judge the ending
without knowing the rest of it.
I like how mean you are.
Well, the characters are all...
Thanks.
That's our train.
Hurry!
Dad's bags aren't going to make it!
- Good morning. Whitman?
- Mm-hmm.
May I see your ticket, please?
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Sweet lime?
Why not?
Why don't you hang on to mine?
It's safer if you keep them.
Let's go get a drink and smoke a cigarette.
