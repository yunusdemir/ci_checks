Ladies and gentlemen.
Away from home,
I rely on the kindness of strangers.
They call me the King of Masks.
I thank you, one and all,
f or your attention.
On my solitary skiff,
I ply the rivers of Sichuan.
Arriving in each honorable town,
I pay a courtesy call...
to the great clans, farmers,
merchants, secret societies...
and even the Christian converts.
Move aside!
Won't you let an old man
do a bit of business?
With better luck, I'd have
a grandson yea tall by now.
Just stop your prattling
and show us your art.
General.
General Liu, it's been ages.
Bureau Chief Huang.
The local big shot!
You're the big wheel 'round here.
Dad! Ma! Here's Tianci.
Gramps!
Good boy. Come here.
Good. Say "Grandpa".
- Come on.
- Gramps.
Silly kid. It's "Grandpa".
- Grandpa.
- Good boy.
The widow kept her lover
a secret to the day she died.
But every wall has its cracks.
I know who it was.
Who? Tell us.
The answer's right under your nose.
He's here among you.
Fearing exposure,
he's about to flee.
Soon as he does, I'll let you know.
Dad, look!
I've heard the Living Bodhisattva
is really a man.
Silly girl!
That's the famous Liang Sulan.
The hottest female impersonator
in Sichuan opera!
Touch his lotus throne,
and a healthy son will be yours.
Really? Let's go do it!
Wait!
Here.
It's not easy for you.
The Living Bodhisattva!
Master Liang!
You are truly a performer's performer.
In all my travels...
I've seen nothing so marvelous
as your art!
Yours is a rare art indeed.
Neither Peking nor Shaanxi opera
have anything like it.
Sichuan opera is famed
for transformations...
but they are paltry
compared to your magic.
The same potion brews differently
in different hands.
Every beggar's got his own stick
for beating off dogs.
Though my skills be meager,
only a son may inherit them.
It's an ancient rule.
Master Liang.
Though mine is a small teacup,
it doesn't leak.
You misunderstand.
I'm not trying to steal your secrets.
Merchants form businesses,
we artists form troupes.
Ropes aren't made
from single strands.
Why not join my troupe?
Split the profits...
and add some color
to our repertoire.
That's like asking
two peaks to merge.
I'm a loner...
used to my solitary ways.
Tell me, Old Master,
have you a disciple?
It's a terrible thought...
but what if--
I was to die without an heir?
A minor matter...
I'll carry to the grave.
How callous of me!
I've hurt your feelings.
Old Master, we each decide
our own course.
Generals never dismount,
but gallop on.
Thank you, brother,
for your patronage.
We're even now.
I wouldn't dare presume.
No one values girls.
Even you'll only make
a boy your heir.
As for me...
I'm a minor character,
half a woman.
I'm not worthy of being called
"brother" by you.
I've spoken out of place.
We all have our own sorrows.
Old Master, find yourself an heir.
Don't let your magic die.
Buy a Goddess of Mercy.
Give birth to a son.
Have a look.
I want one
for the giving of sons.
She looks after all those
in misery.
This is the one you want.
A son is guaranteed.
It's five copper coins.
Take care.
Grandpa.
Grandpa, I don't want money.
I'll clean and cook for you.
Oh, dear.
I want a boy, not a girl.
You don't have to pay a cent, sir.
Just take her, please.
- You're from Shaanxi as well?
- Yes, kind sir.
But I need a boy.
If you'll feed her,
I'll be content.
Kind sir.
Go. Just go.
Sir, just two dollars.
Two dollars, and he's yours.
He's too small.
Can't afford him.
Sir, two dollars only!
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
How old are you?
He's eight. My own son.
If it weren't for the floods,
I wouldn't be doing this.
Ten dollars and he's yours.
Ten dollars?
You think I'm the God of Wealth?
Five then.
Grandpa!
It fits like it was made for him.
Come. Try on these pants.
Doggie. Look.
- A little boat!
- That's our home.
Here, General.
Doggie.
Come here.
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Grandpa, you scared me.
Grandpa!
Don't wolf it down.
Eat slowly. It's all yours.
Doggie, where's home for you?
Here, Grandpa.
I mean, where do you come from?
A place under floodwater.
What's your surname?
Dad says it's Liu.
Your dad? That was your dad?
Don't be ridiculous. Your dad?
What father could sell
his son dry-eyed?
He's a slave trader.
Your dad?
Bastard!
He's a fucking heartless man.
I wouldn't hit a monkey like that.
Poor little melon,
tossed in with a black-hearted turnip!
Grandpa.
Don't cry. Don't cry.
Your luck's changed.
Your name's King now.
You'll be my grandson.
No one would dare strike you now!
Your grandma ran off on me...
thirty years ago.
I was too poor for her.
She left me and our baby boy.
I was mother and father to him.
Changed his diapers,
watched him grow.
When he was ten,
he got sick and died.
If he were alive today...
he'd be 31.
Grandpa's had a tough life.
I've got no one left
I'm lonely and bereft
Doggie.
I'm an old man.
I'll die one day.
Don't die!
What'll I do if you die, Grandpa?
I don't want to die.
But it's not up to us.
I've been afraid no one
will carry on the family line...
and that my art will die with me.
Be a good boy and work hard...
and I'll give you my love...
and my art.
Do you understand?
I want to learn
"change-face" opera, Grandpa.
Good! And I will teach it to you...
and only you.
It's a family heirloom,
not for outsiders.
And not for girls.
Grandpa, I'll do that for you.
Here, this.
What cold little paws!
A little higher.
Higher. Higher.
Where are you going, Doggie?
To have a pee.
Stand at the prow of the boat.
All right.
Go back to sleep, Grandpa.
Careful. Don't fall overboard.
Go away.
One silver dollar and 28 coppers.
So expensive!
Sure is.
PAWN SHOP
It's so early.
Please help. My child's ill,
and I can't afford the medicine.
What'll you give me for this?
Have a good look at it.
It's been in the family
for generations.
Two dollars.
Surely, just a bit more. It's--
All right. If it's two, it's two.
- It's bitter.
- I say it's sweet...
and you'd better drink it up.
Hold onto the bowl.
Old Master.
You've come to see the opera?
Who's the boy?
Boy? My grandson.
Congratulations, Old Master!
Best wishes to you too!
Come here and
take a photo with him.
- Come on up.
- We shouldn't.
It's no trouble.
- Master Liang.
- Come on up.
Bow to Master Liang.
He's so excited!
Stand straight. Look at me.
- Hello, boss.
- Off to the opera?
Beimang Peak.
Master Liang is famous for it!
It's a good opera.
Pardon me.
I'd like to try my luck.
Great!
Eat up.
Once more!
What a skill!
Grandpa!
Get some wine
from over there.
Hurry!
Grandpa cut his foot!
He needs wine. Hurry!
- All right. Just a sec.
- Hurry!
Boss--
King, what happened?
Grandpa.
Boss. Light this.
- Doggie, piss on it.
- Piss?
Boys's piss mixed with cloth ashes
will stop the bleeding.
I can't.
Piss! What's the fuss?
Take down your pants.
No--
What's with you?
I-- I'm a girl!
What? I must've been blind.
- Grandpa.
- Leave me alone.
So young and yet such a crook.
I'm a stupid pig,
letting you trick me like that.
I'm not a crook.
I've been sold seven times.
'Cause I'm a girl...
they've all abused me.
Only you've treated me well...
like family.
I was scared you wouldn't want me.
Grandpa.
Don't sell me.
Who'd want you anyway?
I can't believe I was fooled
by a little girl.
I won't sell you.
But I can't keep you either.
Here's some money.
Good luck.
Grandpa!
Grandpa! I'll cook and clean.
I'll scratch your back.
Just don't send me away!
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Stupid girl! Trying to kill yourself?
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Doggie!
You're like a leech
on a cormorant's foot.
Can't shake you off.
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Don't call me that.
I'm Boss to you now.
You'll work for me.
If you work hard, you can stay on.
Otherwise, we go our separate ways.
Understand?
Yes. I'll work very hard.
Stupid girl.
Making trouble for yourself.
Lower!
Flip over.
Doggie!
Uncles, aunties,
ladies and gentlemen.
Observe the skill
of this seven-year-old child.
She's a novice.
If she does well, clap your hands.
Bravo!
If you show your appreciation
in cash, all the better.
Catch.
Thank you.
Take care.
Mate. You've got my money.
Now tell me how you do it.
Yes, show us your tricks.
Open your eyes.
Yeah, come on.
We'll put our money where our mouth is.
My dear soldiers,
it's a family secret.
I wouldn't sell it
for a thousand taels of gold.
All I can say is 2 plus 2
is the opposite of take.
Please "four-give" me.
Leading us on,
you ungenerous bastard?
Never mind.
We're not going to force you.
Gotta be going.
We'll meet again.
- Hand it over.
- What?
- The money.
- Money?
You're as sneaky with money
as a cat with food.
But you don't show us,
you don't keep the money.
I wouldn't dare keep your money.
The world's a big place.
We'll meet again.
Wait a minute.
I gave you two strings of cash.
Yes, now cough up the other one.
Cough it up.
You treat me
like a performing monkey.
Tomorrow I'm off to war.
Like a meatball thrown at a dog,
I won't be coming back.
You wouldn't even give us
some face, you bastard.
All I wanted was a bit of knowledge
before I died.
So you're a monkey.
Show us your tricks. Make us happy.
My master will only teach
his art to a son.
It can only be passed on to boys,
not girls or outsiders.
He won't even show me.
Who do you think you are?
Little shit!
Don't take offense, gentlemen.
She's only a child.
Look, you want to see
how it's done?
All right, I'll show you
and destroy my living.
But if it will make you all happy...
stand closer and watch.
Gentlemen, it's simple really.
It's all in the hands.
A few weeks' practice and you too
can be a King of Masks.
Good man! We'll study with you
when we return from war.
Here's some money for you, King.
Boss.
You didn't really show them,
did you?
A dragon in the shallows
Is toyed with by shrimps
A tiger out of the jungle
Can be tormented by a dog
Giving up drink?
Haven't seen you for ten days.
Drinking's the only vice
I have left.
If I gave that up, what'd be left?
Help yourself.
It's fresh. Jasmine.
This is your adopted grandson?
Son, daughter, who cares.
It's an extra pair of hands.
Better than being on my own.
True.
Heard you refused
Master Liang's offer.
It wouldn't exactly
have been a piece of cake.
He's as sharp...
as a whip...
and as famous as you can be.
I'm just a street performer.
I'd be way out of my depth.
They say he offered you 100 dollars.
It was kind of him.
I'm happy to be friends.
But even 100 dollars
runs out after a while.
I look after myself,
ask nothing from anyone.
You can never be too talented.
Is there water in this wine?
Or rather, wine in this water?
Boss!
Coming.
Relax. I might do that to others.
Not to you, though.
Boss, this wine seems watered down.
That's slander!
Certainly not.
What gall! Water in the wine!
Try it yourself.
- Good morning.
- Finished up?
Did you steal this?
Aren't you the capable one?
Take it back.
What do you want, Doggie?
Just looking.
What're you doing?
Just looking.
Looking?
Don't go.
All right.
A bit higher.
Doggie, I'll tell you something.
If you've got skill and talent...
the world is yours.
I've never stolen...
or begged from anyone.
I've relied solely on my skills.
Higher.
Give General some more
sweet potato.
- Later I'll take you to the opera.
- The opera?
Master Liang is in his famous role
in Attaining Nirvana.
The evil leader
of his insignificant kingdom...
has entered the Buddhist hell...
his soul never to be released!
Hear the judgment of the law.
Oh, Buddhist patriarchs!
Be merciful.
The princess arrives
on the Boat of Kindness.
Bravo!
Oh, patriarchs.
The burning of
White Sparrow Temple...
was not my father's intention.
He fell into a trap set
by a wicked minister.
Please, hear me out
in my sincerity...
and spare the life
of my father, the king.
The laws of Heaven
make no exception.
If you will show no compassion...
I shall cut this rope...
and fall into the pit of death...
so that I may share
my father's suffering!
No, my daughter!
Princess, you mustn't
take your life so lightly.
Pay her no heed.
Let her do as she will.
Father!
Daughter!
Father!
Daughter!
I haven't been as filial
as I could have been.
Amitabha!
Buddha of Infinite Qualities.
She's attained Nirvana!
Set off the firecrackers!
Where's Young Master?
Tianci?
Where'd Tianci go?
Tianci!
Find him!
Boss.
If the princess died,
how did she come back in the end?
She turned into a god,
like Bodhisattva.
She's a good person, then?
She does good deeds
and rescues souls in strife.
Come on, Doggie.
Boss.
Eat up, Boss.
If only you were a boy.
What do boys have that I don't?
Just a little teapot spout.
Does the goddess
have a teapot spout?
What goddess?
Bodhisattva.
Look, she's got bosoms.
Why do you worship her?
Grandpas and grandmas,
uncles and aunties.
Please bear with my meager skills.
I'll thank you if you give money
and if you don't.
Next my master will perform.
Thank you, auntie!
Thank you, uncle!
Go away.
Grandpa!
Boss! Boss!
Boss! Fire!
Help! Fire!
Boss! Boss!
Stop here.
Master Liang.
Old Master, here's that photo.
I meant to send it to you earlier.
You're too kind.
And how's the little grandson?
Gone off to play.
How's he doing?
He's surely learnt much by now.
Not much to brag about. It'll do.
- How much for a sweet potato?
- Two cents a catty.
- One catty, please.
- One catty.
Take care.
Little devil, stealing potatoes,
are you? Looking for a hiding?
Halt right there!
Try that again and see if
I don't beat you to death.
Hurry.
- Who's there?
- Me.
I've picked up another one.
No willie on her, though.
Come in.
How are you with kids?
Go on.
Go up. Go.
Have this too.
Where's your family?
What's your name?
Tianci.
- What?
- Tianci.
Go for it.
Eight's wealth and love.
Seven's clever, three's stars above.
Drink up.
Let's go.
Come on. Careful. Hurry.
What?
You're sweet, but you'll
never be a real grandson.
Grandma's bridge is nigh...
Grandma says I'm a sweetie pie.
Where's Grandma's house?
By the river.
Who lives there?
Grandma, Uncle and Auntie.
What's Auntie do?
She makes dumplings and noodles.
- Sister, I have to pee.
- All right. Come on.
A little teapot spout.
Grandpa would like you.
I miss Grandpa.
I do too.
Tomorrow I'll take you
to see Grandpa.
My grandpa's the King of Masks.
He's great!
He'll feed you rice...
and yummy meat dishes.
Faithful one.
Have you come to pray for an heir?
Buddha, be merciful!
I just want to ask
if in this lifetime...
I will have an heir
to continue the family line.
Guo Ziyi had many children
in his home.
Dou Yanshan's five sons
with glory shone.
The Yangs produced eight generals,
tigers all.
You have one stick of joss
in your ancestral hall.
Amazing!
Alas, my one little seedling--
Was trampled.
Don't despair.
Luck and misfortune
are intertwined.
Your fate holds a grandson.
Where is he then?
You will find him
to the north of here, by water.
To the north, by water?
- Grandpa!
- Who's your grandpa?
The King of Masks.
Who are you? What's your name?
Tianci.
Tianci-- "Heaven sent"?
You've a little teapot spout!
You really are heaven sent!
Tianci...
tell Grandpa where you live.
Dunno!
What's your surname?
It's Tianci.
- Who brought you here?
- Sister.
Sister?
What sister?
Was it-- Where is she?
Doggie!
Doggie!
Doggie!
Our country has witnessed...
numerous child kidnappings.
Tianci, 4, was taken from
the prominent Wen family.
He is 3'2", round face, black eyes...
and was wearing brown pants
and a blue gown.
Grandpa Mask King!
Grandpa Mask King!
Master!
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Louder! Hurry.
Tianci! Tianci!
Tianci! Let Grandma see you.
Mommy was worried
to death about you.
The King of Masks?
Seems to be quite famous
round these parts.
He abducts people's children?
- And the Wen child?
- He's been taken home.
What's that?
A monkey. When we arrested him,
the monkey followed.
Officer.
What's going on?
The literati have their forums,
the military their schools...
the secret societies their hails
and performers their stages.
Surely, there is a place for reason.
Stop prattling. What's your name?
- My humble surname--
- Stand up to speak!
Is Wang.
They call me King of Masks.
So we've heard.
A real street character.
I wouldn't presume.
I've only got a minor place
in the Green Dragon Society.
I trust my mates to look after me.
Who are you calling your mates?
If you belong to them,
you know the rules.
Break the rules
and take the consequences.
You make your bed, you lie in it.
Now tell us how
you've abducted those children.
I swear before heaven and earth...
and may I be struck down
by lightning if I lie...
I wouldn't dare do such a thing.
Don't try confusing us
with fancy talk.
I'm asking you, how did the Wen boy
end up on your boat?
- You mean Tianci?
- Yes.
It was Doggie
who brought him to me.
- Doggie?
- Yes.
She knew I wanted
an heir, a grandson.
Go on.
Which gang does Doggie belong to?
What sort of nickname is that?
An outsider or a local?
Neither.
She's just a little girl.
About so tall and eight years old.
An eight-year-old girl?
Bullshit! Looks like you've got
a big-time case to answer for.
Ready to confess yet?
Hit him again.
Confess!
Sir, we wore him down.
He's signed.
Good.
Let's hang all
the kidnapping cases on him...
and solve them in one stroke.
Hurry.
General! Come here.
So, you've got company.
He even volunteered for jail.
Old man, here's a chamber pot.
At least you won't be lonely.
My grandpa didn't steal
anyone's child. It was me.
I don't know anything
about your grandpa's case.
But it'd be a damn shame
if he were to die.
Look, you go and play for a while.
When I'm off, I'll meet you
at the gate and get you in.
Boss!
Boss! Boss!
I only wanted you
to have a grandson.
I never thought
I'd get you into trouble.
Boss! It's so unfair!
So unfair!
If there's mud in your pants...
people will say you shit in them.
Boss, punish me!
Can't dodge what fate's got in store.
Doggie, I don't blame you.
It's fate. I accept it.
Boss!
I've brought your
most precious things.
What precious things?
Let me have a look.
Your masks, King of Masks.
Take them with you to hell
to scare off the demons.
I've played with these my whole life.
They're useless now.
Didn't bring them into the world;
can't take them when I go.
I've broken the tradition.
Broken it.
Boss!
It'll truly be a lost art.
Boss!
Don't cry, Doggie.
In a former life...
I must've wronged you badly...
and now I'm repaying the debt.
It was karma.
Doggie...
take General with you.
I've given you comfort...
taught you some skills.
Burn spirit money for me...
in the Ghost Festivals...
and you'll have done
the right thing by me.
Boss!
Boss!
Don't cry.
You old bastard,
your granddaughter's saying good-bye...
and you can't even give her a smile.
- Come on.
- Boss! Boss!
Come here, Doggie! Quick.
What are you planning
to do about Grandpa?
I don't know.
Tears are no use.
You know the Living Bodhisattva?
The opera singer?
He's Grandpa's friend
and a big shot in this country.
I think only he can help.
Go find him.
Living Bodhisattva!
Living Bodhisattva!
Master Liang, you'll catch a chill.
No need. Spring is here.
Living Bodhisattva, Master Liang!
And you are?
I'm Doggie,
the King of Masks' grandson.
The King's grandson? Doggie?
Weren't you a boy?
No, I was sold.
What are you doing here?
Grandpa's been arrested.
You've got to save him!
You're the only one who can.
What's this all about?
It's the grandson
of the King of Masks!
Tell me what happened
to Grandpa, child.
Come. Get up. Come.
Come on. She needs care.
The lightest breeze can blow you
inside the prison gates...
but the strongest ox
can't pull you out again.
Yet if he dies on
these trumped-up charges...
his art will die with him.
Such a pity.
Oh, please, save him!
He has no other family.
You are a fine, filial child.
I'll do my best.
Have some water.
I've never even served
my own father this well.
But you don't have long to live.
The monk has no sons,
but so many are filial to him.
You've always got a snappy answer.
You can sacrifice your body
but not lose an argument.
You've only got five days left.
Can't you say something nice?
I've been framed.
Framed!
They said it was a local matter...
rather involved too.
They told me to stay out of it.
Li Xiang.
Give the child a bit of money.
Help her out.
Doggie.
I can't save your grandpa.
Doggie.
We're just actors, both of us.
We don't count for much in society.
Master Liang.
A sweet man doth seem this king
I shall test him with my flirting
And see if my hopes
to him might cling
My horse, of Groom
to me now bring
The generals must be hastening
General, you are a truly fine drummer
and excellent singer.
Really outstanding.
The opera fans have really
had a treat tonight!
Everyone, today is my 66th birthday.
Please join me for a feast
at the Hall of Drunken Fairies.
Great!
General!
The King of Masks was framed!
Doggie?
What opera is this?
General, it's not an opera.
It's a plea for help.
Doggie, are you crazy?
General, the King of Masks
is no kidnapper!
I rescued that boy
and took him to the King.
What is she talking about?
I spoke to you about this
a few days ago.
I asked you to look into it.
I told you the army can't interfere
in local matters.
What--
If you won't help,
I'll cut the rope and die.
Don't be silly, Doggie!
She's just trying to scare us.
I don't believe she'll do it.
Let's go eat.
- General!
- General!
Doggie!
General!
Are you truly not moved
by this child's actions...
and her plea?
Can you just stand by
and do nothing?
Do you have a heart of stone?
Well, thank you for
your previous kindness, but...
I am taking this girl off
to find justice...
and will traverse the whole country
if I have to.
A terrible injustice has been done!
A terrible injustice has been done!
Hold it!
You live up to your nickname
of the Living Bodhisattva.
Though merely an actor,
you have courage and character.
I may be a soldier,
but I'm not a bastard.
She's touched my heart too.
I'll take care of this matter!
A drop of compassion deserves
a wellspring of gratitude.
I really don't know how to--
You know, back then...
I didn't appreciate your offer.
I'm happy to show you now--
You misunderstand.
I wouldn't dream of taking
advantage of your misfortune.
I wouldn't be worthy of
the brotherhood of the streets if I did.
The world is a cold place...
but we can bring warmth to it.
What other enjoyment
would there be to life?
Master Liang.
Please, Old Master, rise.
Please, rise.
Sit down.
You shouldn't thank me anyway.
Thank Doggie.
Doggie is your true savior.
Doggie!
Doggie!
Boss!
Doggie!
Call me Grandpa.
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Grandpa! Grandpa!
