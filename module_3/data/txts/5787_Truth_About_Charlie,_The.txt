The queen of Sheba
will soon come crashing down...
Daddy was just a girl in disguise.
Oh.
Excusez-moi, monsieur.
Merci.
- Whoa.
Attendez.
I beg you, please. No!
No! No!
Hercules, darling,
how could you do that to me?
I begged you.
I just couldn't resist.
You couldn't resist it?
I don't believe it!
Oh, Sylvia,
what am I gonna do?
How can I ever
explain it to him?
Well, Regina,
break it gently...
and then soak him
for all he's worth.
Oh, I don't even care
about the money.
All I ever really wanted
was someone...
Excuse me.
Does this belong to you?
Now what's he gone and done?
Well, he was creating
a fairly sophisticated
surveillance system...
behind the ladies' cabanas.
You see? He's completely
out of control.
It's all that
nascent testosterone.
Oh, yeah.
It's the scourge of the planet,
that stuff. Herky, sit.
Thanks for not turning him in.
Oh. You're welcome.
Well...
- See ya.
- Quitter.
What?
Nothing.
You called me a quitter.
You give up awful easy.
Ooh.
Yeah. Hi.
Oh.
I think it's okay to
ask your name now that
we're in another country together.
Regina... Lambert.
Joshua Peters.
Charmed.
I'm gonna ask you something
real quick and make it like
ripping off a Band-Aid, okay?
Ow. Go ahead.
Is there a Mister Regina?
Not for long.
Your ride didn't show?
Yeah. It's par for the course,
I'm afraid.
Well, you need a hand?
Yes. Yes, that would be great.
Thank you.
Merci.
I would invite you in,
but it's not...
I get it.
Nice neighborhood.
Fancy. Well,
I'm off.
It was a pleasure
meeting you, Reggie.
Good luck.
It was really nice
meeting you too.
Oh. Something
to remember me by.
"Caribbean. "
I've just come back
from there, but...
- You'll have to read it and
find out what you've missed.
Maybe next time
you're in Martinique
you'll be single.
- See you around, Reggie.
Pardon.
It's Regina,
but that's okay.
Charles?
Honorine?
Charles.
Charles.
Charlie.
Oh.
Madame Lambert?
This is your husband?
Monsieur Charles Lambert?
Your husband's body was found
next to the train tracks,
just outside of Montpellier.
Were you aware of his departure
from France Thursday?
Charles travels all the time.
His effects included
a one-way airline ticket
from Barcelona...
to Caracas, Venezuela.
Also one to Rio deJaneiro,
Brazil.
Does he know anyone
in Caracas?
In Rio?
Your husband was American?
No. Wait. No.
Charles is Swiss... was Swiss.
His profession?
Art dealer.
Where is his gallery?
He did most of his work
over the telephone,
on the computer.
Okay. Family?
I believe I'm all there is,
Commandant.
He was an orphan...
an only child.
Non, merci.
Charles Lambert...
was a wealthy man?
We live"... lived" quite well.
Why did you
say his name like that?
Is this
your husband's passport?
I believe so.
Yes.
You see? Switzerland.
Swiss.
And this?
- Uh...
- And this?
And this?
Oh!
Perhaps I will have that ciggy.
Forgive me,
but you are married
only three months.
- Is that illegal?
- And your marriage...
a happy one?
I was about to ask
Charles for a divorce,
if you must know.
I see.
How many financial accounts
did you and your husband hold?
Excusez-moi, Commandant.
Why haven't you found the killer yet?
Where are my belongings?
Where is our furniture?
Why is my apartment empty?
Who tore it apart?
Your husband liquidated
the contents of your flat...
through three
reputable auction houses
and cashed the proceeds,
roughly the equivalent
of $1.8 million immediately.
Madame, there is not
a trace of this money
anywhere.
La Direction Centrale
de la PoliceJudiciaire
is confident of this:
When we find the money,
we find the killer.
Search him.
- Ooh!
No. Nothin'.
Okay. The cops don't have it,
and Charlie's clean.
Then who the hell's got it?
One Hermes wallet,
belonging to Charles Lambert,
containing 1,000 French francs,
1,500 deutsche marks,
300 U.S. dollars, 5,000 pesetas,
50 Caribbean dollars.
The keys to Flat "B,"
12 Rue Desbordes Valmore.
Your residence?
One "trousse de toilette,"
containing the usual items,
including one tube ofTopol,
"the smoker's tooth polish."
Mrs. Lambert? "Allô?"
Yes.
One letter,
stamped and sealed,
addressed to you.
Addressed to me?
My dear Regina,
today I'm off to Cannes.
Got a lead on
a couple of Renoirs and maybe
a Schnabel and a Basquiat.
Can't wait for your return.
Thought you might be amused
by the enclosed clipping.
Love, Charles.
P.S., the tailor called.
- Your dress is ready.
- Show me the clipping.
There was none included.
We took the liberty
of calling your tailor.
We thought perhaps
we would learn something.
Did you?
Yes. Your dress "is" ready.
His agenda.
Charles Lambert's last day
was busy.
To us, largely meaningless.
It is your right as next of kin
to claim the possessions
of the deceased at this time.
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
et cetera, et cetera.
If you will sign...
Your cooperation today
will be noted.
Noted?
Commandant Dominique,
do you actually believe
I had something to do
with my husband's death?
Madame, I'm sorry,
but professionally,
I'm obliged to accept
that possibility.
Regina?
Joshua.
Your husband.
Reggie, I'm so sorry.
God, you terrified me.
I'm awfully sorry. I...
I saw it on the news tonight.
This is the most horrific
day of my life.
What a nightmare.
I've got to get out of here.
The next thing I know, caution
has obviously been thrown to the winds.
We're at the Portabella
retrospective in Berlin,
visiting his old friends
in Uganda, Sarajevo, Montréal.
Impulse marriage
at the Chelsea registry office.
It was...
It was all so exciting...
so promising at first.
Whirlwind romance.
Moved to Paris.
And then...
Then seems like he's
always off on business.
I'm mostly alone
in this huge flat.
And now...
And now...
Now I'm slightly drunk,
I'm afraid.
You're a good listener.
No.
You're a good talker.
Have you ever been in love
in Paris, Joshua?
Uh, I can't say that I've
had that pleasure, Reggie.
Well,
you're still young.
Maybe you still
have a chance.
That'd be nice.
Oh, yes. A bed.
Oh, thank God.
Thank you.
You are welcome.
Sweet dreams then.
What?
I'm gonna crash.
Room 28, second floor,
if you need me.
Oh.
Sleep well, okay?
Oh! Charles's bag.
Wha... Oh.
Sorry.
Good night, Reggie.
It's Regina, you know.
Nobody calls me Reggie.
Nobody at all, huh?
Not till now anyway.
Good.
Merci.
Oui.
Bon soir.
Bon soir.
Bon soir.
Bon soir.
Monsieur?
Hmm? "Oui, madame?"
Je peut vous aidez, Commandant?
For me.
Do something for me.
Okay. I will.
Peut-je avoir votre passeport,
s'il vous plaît?
Sure thing. May I ask
what's up here, Commandant?
Monsieur?
And already you're moving her
into your hotel?
Tucking her in at night?
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Hmm, it's kind of
a damsel in distress thing.
Yes, I know.
Slain husband, missing money.
Cops breathing
down her neck.
Exactly.
And now
the mysterious stranger.
Okay. Fine.
You're here on holiday?
Actually, I live here
off and on.
She's a real beauty,
isn't she?
I suppose she is. Yes.
I always wonder
with a woman like that...
what kind of guy actually
gets to go to bed with her?
Well, in this case,
a dead one, I guess.
Well, surely you're not
suspicious of her, Commandant.
No?
Well, she just doesn't
seem like the type.
Which type is that?
The murdering type?
Mm-hmm.
Cheese. Cheese.
Merci, monsieur.
I'll take that, Mrs. Lambert.
Mr. Bartholomew?
How do you do?
Wait here, Pierre.
Sorry our first meeting
has to take place under
such unhappy circumstances.
We have a great deal to cover,
and I'm on a bit of
a tight schedule today.
How you holding up?
I'm bewildered,
to tell you the truth.
French police
been bothering you?
They seem to think I had
something to do with this...
this hideous...
I'm afraid we can't interfere
there... not just now anyway.
I want you to know
you'll have every protection
the United States has to offer.
Protecting British citizens?
Isn't that a little bit
out of your jurisdiction?
Your husband occasionally
lent his services to us
here at the O.D.C.
The what?
Most secure
talk space in town.
The O.D.C. Office of Defense
Cooperation, Mrs. Lambert.
We, of course, knew your husband
by his real name, Charlie Lake.
Now, Mrs. Lake,
I'd like you to look at
this photograph, please,
and tell me if there's
anyone you recognize.
Have a good look.
Charles, of course.
What about the other three?
Afraid not.
They worked with Charlie
almost three years ago
on an operation...
of an extraordinarily
delicate nature.
I "get it."
I need to assess just how
precarious your situation is.
Now, this gentleman
who escorted you
to your hotel last night.
A friend. Joshua Peters.
He has nothing to do with this.
- How long have you known Mr. Peters?
- Actually, I just met him.
Oh, boy.
Look, I don't mean
to be intrusive,
but we don't know quite
what Charlie was up to...
or who he was up to it with.
- But we do know $6 million is
a significant amount of money.
- Six million?
- Is that what this is about?
- Correct.
I want to make it
perfectly clear that even
if we wanted to, which we don't,
we couldn't force you to do it.
Your decision must be
entirely your own, Mrs. Lake.
What decision?
To work with us.
If you think I'm
getting mixed up in this,
you're absolutely bonkers.
- You already are mixed up
in it, Mrs. Lake.
- Stop calling me that.
- We want that money back,
Mrs. Lambert.
- I don't have it.
Oh, yes, you do. You have it.
You just don't know you've got it.
A misplaced key to
a safe-deposit box, a certified
check in tomorrow's mail,
or a baggage claim ticket
tucked in a paperback.
If you look for it,
you'll find it.
You may not have
a great deal of time either.
The people in that photo...
They know you've got it
just as surely as we do.
You won't be safe until that money
is in our hands. Is that clear?
This is my direct cell line.
Don't lose it, Mrs. Lambert.
Call me anytime, day or night.
And, please, this is crucial.
You mustn't betray...
the confidentiality
of this dialogue.
You must not tell anyone
about coming to see me.
Certainly. No problem.
I promise you.
It's clear that you're
a very decent person, Mrs. L.
That's a rare quality nowadays.
Tough situation you're in here,
but I feel for you.
God bless.
His agenda.
Charles Lambert's last day
was busy.
To us, largely meaningless.
"12:00, 8 Rue des Rosiers,
Clignancourt. "
The flea market.
Twenty-four.
Four. Okay.
Nine.
So then eight must be...
Pardon.
Regina, right?
My name is Lola.
I knew your husband.
I see.
So, were you
Charlie's trophy, Regina,
or his partner?
Do you know what
I'm talking about when
I say Operation Verify?
How about this?
Forty-six Eppler-cut diamonds?
Believe it or not,
Lola, I don't want that money.
Okay.
So you know about it.
You just don't want it.
I see.
I may be the only one,
but that's how it is.
Charlie ripped off
some very dangerous people.
I don't know anything
about my husband's
business interests.
Hmm.
I though you just said...
I don't mean to be rude,
Then don't be.
But are you finished?
Not quite.
See, your husband...
messed us up...
something fierce.
Regina,
am I getting through to you
at all here?
Reggie?
Regina.
We earned that money.
We want it.
"We dese"rv"e it."
Are you all right?
Was that woman giving you
a hard time?
You could say that.
Yes, she was.
Joshua, what are you
doing here?
I can't believe this.
I saw you getting your cab
back in town.
I followed, almost lost you
a couple times.
Just caught up in time
to see you coming inside here.
I really do seem to be
caught up in a terrible mess.
Yeah, but why are you here
in this neighborhood, in this place?
I don't understand.
A notation in Charles's
date book...
"8 Rue des Rosiers."
I'm trying to make sense
of his last day...
the places that he went to.
Joshua, it's not just
that Charles was murdered.
There's all this other money...
government money
that's gone missing.
And there are other people...
who want it.
And that man is one of them.
So was the woman
in the alley.
Ah! Monsieur Peter.
I'm gonna get my messages,
and then I'll get that stuff
in my room.
I'll meet you upstairs?
Okay.
Great fish. And I hear
their wine list was...
- Have a good look.
- I think you have...
something that belongs to me.
In here?
- Joshua!
- All right.
Get your filthy...
I'm just trying to
open the bag.
- Reggie.
- Calm down.
I will not calm down.!
Reggie.
- Joshua!
Hey!
Go!
- Wait.
- Go.
Joshua.!
Joshua! Joshua!
- Hello?
- Mr. Bartholomew.
They're here.
I saw them.
Mrs. Lambert.
The ones in the photograph.
Describe them to me,
Mrs. Lambert.
Emil Zadapec.
II-Sang Lee.
Lola Jansco.
All three, very dangerous,
highly capable individuals.
It's absolutely imperative
that I see you as soon
as possible, Mrs. Lambert.
Reggie?
Mrs. Lambert?
- Coming. I've got to go,
Mr. Bartholomew.
- Please use extreme caution.
Yes, I will. I promise.
Oh.
Everything all right?
What about you?
It might be a bit wrinkled.
My dress.
Are you okay now?
Oh, I'm still shaking.
What happened?
What did you do?
Oh, nothing much.
I don't think
he'll be bothering you
anymore though.
How you doing?
You know what's wrong with you,
Joshua Peters?
What?
Absolutely nothing.
Mmm.
I feel a little funny
about this.
My kisses are funny?
You hungry?
Yeah.
Great.
Starving.
I got lots of goodies.
I'm... I'm gonna shower first.
Okay.
Just make yourself
at home, okay?
Reggie?
How'd you know
about those people today?
What?
Those three.
And the missing money.
Where did you find out
about all that?
Uh, shoot.
Uh...
Look...
I'm afraid I can't tell you.
I promised.
Promised? Who?
I'm sorry.
I want you to hear this.
Huh?
It's Aznavour.
You know him?
"- Shoot the Piano Player," right?
Exactly.
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs. Lambert.
Don't hang up on me.
Look, I'm sorry
about the elevator.
- I have nothing to say to you.
- We've gotta talk.
Who is it?
The guy from the elevator.
- What? Give me the phone.
- Wait. Who...
Is that Dyle there?
Who?
Mr. Dyle.
Has he laid his little
Charles Aznavour routine
on you yet?
What's he saying?
Yeah. That's right.
Reggie.
Okay.
Nobody wants to hurt you.
- Reggie, what did he say?
- All we want is what's ours.
We know that you have it.
Dyle's not to be trusted.
He wants your money.
He'll do any...
What did he say?
That if I don't
give him the money,
he'll kill me.
Why would he kill you?
He's just saying that to scare
you, Reggie. That's all.
As long as they think
you have that money...
Then why is Charles dead?
He obviously knew
where that money is.
Reggie, listen.
I'm on your side,
and I wish you'd tell me
everything you know...
promises or no promises...
so I could be of some help.
I think you'd better go,
Joshua.
I'm afraid
I've lost my appetite.
Oh.
I'm very tired.
I understand. It's...
It's been a long day.
Please,
I really need to think.
Well, just remember,
I'm on your side.
Yeah.
Hey!
You people
want to get rich or not?
Don't go getting
all rhetorical on us now, Dyle.
Hey.
Answer my question.
Rich or not rich?
Does she have the money
or not, Dyle?
I think she does.
Here's my problem.
You say there was nothing
with Charlie in the train,
in his bags,
in his clothes... whatever.
But size up, Dyle, it's all smoke.
You got zero credibility
around here.
You're right, Lola.
I already got what I want.
Yet I choose to subject myself
to this bullshit anyway.
You just want to
get in her pants... anyway.
Zadapec, I'm not even touching
your psychodrama in the elevator
and your crazed phone call.
You know what, Dyle?
One more
little crazed phone call...
this time to
the Paris police department...
and they have Charlie Lake's killer.
Isn't that right?
Right?
Now don't forget that
the next time you come
waltzing in here.
Don't forget that for a minute.
All high and mighty
like you're God's gift to us.
Zad?
He's right, buddy.
No more
loose cannon stuff, okay?
We're stuck with him
for the time being,
and he is stuck with us.
Cool, Zad?
Okay, maniac?
The only way this works
is if she trusts me.
Lose that, end of story.
Hey, Zadapec.
Your phone call really
spooked her. I want you to
tell me exactly what you said.
Well, you're not gonna like it.
Mr. Bartholomew?
Are you there,
Mr. Bartholomew?
- Shh, Mrs. Lambert.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
What's going on,
Mrs. Lambert?
Mr. Bartholomew.
Yes.
Who is Dyle?
What about Dyle?
The man in the elevator...
Zadapec...
Zadapec. Yes?
He called
Joshua Peters "Dyle."
Zadapec called Peters "Dyle"?
Tell me about him.
Dyle.
Now.
Okay. All right.
Um, okay. Uh...
Carson J. Dyle.
Major, Special Forces.
Highly decorated
in the Gulf War.
Mogadishu.
Then he drops out.
Head honchos Global Options,
the top-drawer service outfit
of the '90s, till
his untimely demise.
Demise?
Death, Mrs. Lambert.
I know what demise means,
Mr. Bartholomew.
Carson Dyle
was terminated in 1998...
by Eastern European
militia near the former
Yugoslavian border,
40 kilometers east of Sarajevo.
Now, wait.
Dyle worked with Charles?
He knew Charles?
Unfortunately for Dyle, yes.
In '98,
Dyle mounted a special ops unit
for a high-level covert
hostage extraction...
on behalf of the O.D.C.
In those days, the O.D.C.
Couldn't deal directly
with outside contractors.
That's where
your Charlie Lakes came in.
He was
an independent facilitator.
The O.D.C. would put him
on the research payroll
for a limited time.
He would book the professionals,
negotiate with the adversaries...
wrangle all the slimy details.
Your husband brokered the deal
to go in, transfer the assets
and get our man out.
Keep going. I'm with you.
The unit choppered in,
accompanied by Charlie,
transporting $6 million
in internally flawless,
Eppler-cut diamonds as ransom.
They were ambushed
shortly after landing.
Carson Dyle and most
of the Global Options team
were totally decimated.
Cut to ribbons.
Never had a chance.
Your husband and the three
from the photograph...
were the only ones
to make it out alive.
We believe those four
stashed the diamonds...
with plans to return
and claim them for themselves.
But how did Charles manage to...
The four of them lied
during the inquiry and waited.
We believe Charlie Lake
broke from his agreement
with the other three,
recovered
the diamonds on his own
and completely vanished.
And maybe Carson Dyle lived.
Trust me, Mrs. Lambert.
Carson Dyle is dead.
You've gotta find out
everything you can...
about your enthusiastic
new friend Peters...
or Dyle,
or whatever his name is.
We need to know
how he fits into the equation.
Oh, Mr. Bartholomew,
I already told you.
My great goal is for
far less involvement
in this sordid mess. Not more.
I was wrong about you,
Mrs. Lambert.
Meeting the widow
of a man like Lake...
Well, I was expecting...
a siren, a harpy, a shrew.
But you...
You have decency, dignity...
what my father
used to call gumption.
I'm very touched.
You are actually quite sweet
for a stars-and-bars
company man, aren't you?
You've discovered
my secret side, Mrs. Lambert.
Keep it under your hat.
Boo!
Excusez-moi, mademoiselle.
Merci, mademoiselle.
Ah. She left this
for you, Mr. Peters.
Aznavour!
Merci, monsieur.
Hello?
Bonjour, monsieur.
Uh, is he an American?
Yes, he is.
One moment, please.
I'll try to find out.
Merci, monsieur.
Oh, my God.
You "are" Dyle!
- Reggie?
- It's the only name "I've" got.
Reggie, we need to talk.
I've never been so betrayed
and humiliated in all my life.
- I had to make sure
that you weren't involved.
- You had to make sure...
I wasn't involved!
No, no.
That's not what I meant. I...
Merci, mademoiselle.
Merci beaucoup, monsieur.
You're meant to be dead,
monsieur.
I do owe you an explanation.
Reggie, my name
is Alexander Dyle.
Carson was my brother.
Shake hands?
"How do you do?"
You have got to be joking.
Reggie.
Reggie.
It's Regina!
I can explain everything.
Monsieur Philippe.
Reggie, wait!
Please, Reggie,
you gotta listen to me.
Reggie, Charles and
the three people following you...
they betrayed Carson.
They stole the money
he was entrusted with.
I'm trying to get to the truth
by conspiring with them.
Well, how noble of you
to embrace their techniques.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, really,
about your brother and everything,
but give me a break.
Reggie, I hate
that you're caught up in this.
But at the same time I'm glad...
because it means that we've met.
I liked Joshua Peters,
and now he's gone.
Monsieur.
Oui.
Stay here in Paris,
Reggie. With me.
Don't buy that ticket.
What do you think?
- Madame?
La, la, la, la, la!
Bye.
Did you mean what you said
in the taxi?
Everything.
Which part?
The part about that
you're really, really...
glad that you met me
or something like that.
Deeply.
That's sweet... Alex.
I'm still going to London.
Wait.
No, you're not.
You're not goin'
anywhere, Reggie.
Reggie?
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome.
Whoa!
"Okay," crise cardiaque.
Cardiac arrest. "Mort subite."
Sudden death syndrome.
Our preliminary
forensic reports.
And nobody wants to offer me
a more complicated explanation?
Okay. Regina?
A word with you alone,
s'il vous plaît.
The rest of you may leave.
Commandant, I was hoping to
remain here with Madame Lambert.
You especially, monsieur,
may leave.
I was hoping that maybe
I could be of some assistance.
Merci, monsieur.
Au revoir.
That's okay.
You said yesterday that
your husband was an orphan.
An only child?
That's right.
A woman showed up at the morgue
early this morning.
From the provinces. Rully.
She identified
your husband's corpse
as her unmarried son.
Charles du Lac.
"Du Lac"?
Du Lac... Lake.
Charlie Lake.
The old woman said...
her husband beat her son,
and her, without mercy.
Every day. Until one evening
the father fell to his death
from a bedroom window.
Fourteen-year-old Charles
left home the next day.
She's seen him only occasionally
in the years since then.
Why are you telling me
all this, Commandant?
The woman seemed
quite deranged.
Hmm.
I worry for her.
She's convinced
you are responsible
for her son's death.
The missing money.
Well, there
should be a club.
Unfortunately, she's already
on a train back to Rully.
- Ah!
- Regina, I trust you.
You're not a suspect here.
But I do believe you can
lead us to the killer.
And I very much want
your help.
- Commandant...
- Please, Regina. Call meJeanne.
Merci.
I trust you, too.
You will cooperate?
If it means getting
to the truth, yes.
Exactly what kind
of cooperation did
you have in mind, Jeanne?
Whatever it takes to help us
find out everything possible...
about your mysterious
Mr. Peters and his friends.
Whatever it takes?
I'm asking you to find out
everything you can, Regina.
Open up. Dig deep.
Just be very, very careful.
Okay, everybody.
The moment you've
all been waiting for.
- Charlie's last day.
You too, Alex. Dive in.
Okay, here's
Charlie's letter.
You satisfied?
Tell us about Sarajevo,
Mrs. Lake.
Sarajevo? How did you
know about Sara...
I mentioned you told me
a little about your travels.
Mrs. Lambert. Carson Dyle
was terminated...
in 1998 by Eastern European
militia near the former
Yugoslavian border,
forty kilometers
east of Sarajevo.
You've got nothing
to hide, Regina.
You can tell them
about Sarajevo.
What about Sarajevo?
Tell us about your border crossings,
custom checks,
any chance encounters.
We need to know
everything about Sarajevo.
Okay.
I'll start from the beginning.
Very good, Mrs. Lake.
Bon appétit.
Is that table
reserved for them?
They don't know
about this place.
Oh, you didn't tell them
we were coming here?
No.
Unlike everything else about
us, what I confided in you,
et cetera, et cetera.
Reggie, what did the cop want
when she asked you to stay?
She doesn't seem to
like you very much, Alex.
Am I still
allowed to kiss you?
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh, that's nice.
Really nice.
There's one other thing.
Which is?
I told them it was me
that killed Charles.
Why would you say
a terrible thing like that?
Okay, Reggie,
I'm gonna ask you again.
This person you don't want
to tell me about?
What do they know about Charles?
I don't want to
play that game anymore.
I don't want to
play any games anymore.
I never break a promise.
- Listen, Regina.
I've really gotten to like you.
I think you're very special.
Yeah. I'm sure.
"Now, can I have that money?"
Right. Hand it over.
I couldn't
stand you when I first met you.
I thought you were so stuck up.
But now I've got a crush on you.
Aw, shucks, girl.
Watch out for Dyle,
Regina. I mean it.
Putting in some overtime?
I see I'm not the only one.
You better back off, Lola.
Did you tell her who
killed Charlie yet, Dyle?
Back off, Lola!
You back off.
Pardon.
- All right. I'll get one.
Oh, eh, allez.
- Go-o!
Lachez-moi!
Quelle salope.!
No!
Lola?
Regina? D-Dyle.
Lola, you hold on.
There's help coming.
D-Dyle.
No, no, no, no. Lola,
he didn't really kill Charles.
- He just told you that, I promise.
- Dyle. Dyle.
N- No.
No.!
Oh, Lola.
We were entitled
to a share of those diamonds,
after what we went through,
Mrs. Lake.
She said, "Dyle."
It's the last thing she said.
- Oh, Reggie, I...
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And in the club, she said,
"Watch out for Dyle."
- Reggie, I...
Why have you never
gone to the police
with your suspicions?
Your brother's death?
Those three? Charles?
I guess I want
that money too.
This is...
very illuminating.
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?
It's Saturday.
Charlie's last day.
Good night.
Good night, Reggie.
Hmm.
"My dear Regina,
I'm off today to Cannes.
"Got a lead on
a couple of Renoirs,
maybe a Schnabel...
"and a Basquiat.
Can't wait for you."
Oui? Allô? Allô?
- I've got it.
- What? What have you got?
I know.
Why didn't I think of that?
Listen. Lieutenant Dessalines will be
over in ten minutes to get you.
We've got some work to do.
I'll get my people ready,
- and see you at headquarters
in half an hour, okay?
- Brilliant.
"12:00 noon. 8 Rue des Rosiers.
Clignancourt.
The flea market. "
- D'accord.
Je vous rappelle
dans quinze minutes.
D'accord?
D'accord.
Let's go over there
and take a look.
Fancy meeting you here.
Hi.
You find what you were
looking for, Alex?
Reggie, you've found
something, haven't you?
Well, well, well.
The gang's all here.
What's left of it, anyway.
Excusez-moi, monsieur.
Oui?
Yes. Just a little.
Also some "Japonaise."
Mandarine.
Tragic history, monsieur.
Mister Hyppolite's place.
He made a great fortune
last week.
He was, uh, retiring.
Going to see the world.
Ahh! Hmm.
Next day,
he was dead.
What did he sell?
Hector?
He traded in
postage stamps.
Stamps?
Yes.
The collectors called him
"The Seeker."
He could find
anything for you.
If you could afford.
Ahh!
Stamps?
What's he doing, Reggie?
Where's he going?
Where's he going?
I don't know!
Alex!
Get you hands off of me.!
Alex.!
Stamps!
Where is it?
What are you doing?
Where's Charlie's bag?
Where is it?
What?
Where's what?
The envelope!
The stamps!
Hello?
Watch out!
Châtelet.
Hello? Monsieur?
Where is everybody?
Monsieur?
Hello?
Oh, no.
It's not here.
Is it?
- You killed him!
- Of course I didn't.
- You're a murderer!
- Reggie!
Reggie.!
Reggie, don't be ridiculous.!
Reggie.!
Reggie!
- Reggie!
Reggie, wait.!
Reggie!
Reggie! Wait!
- Mr. Bartholomew!
- It's okay, Mrs. Lambert.
You're safe now.
- Are you armed, Mr. Bartholomew?
Thank God.
- At all times, Mrs. Lambert.
Well, this is convenient.
This is him.!
Joshua Peters,
Alexander Dyle...
whoever he is.
You have the assets,
Mrs. Lambert?
Wait a minute.!
The assets? Reggie!
Is this who you've been...
- No. Yes!
- So. My long-lost and
nonexistent kid brother Alex.
A.K.A. Mr. Bartholomew.
Nice to meet you.
No!
I've never seen
a ghost before.
- Pleasure's all mine.
- What's going on here?
Reggie, my name
is Lewis Bartholomew.
- Really?
- I'm a special investigator for
the Unites States Office...
of Defense Cooperation.
- Really?
- Your secret partner here
is the real Dyle.
Carson Dyle.
Mrs. Lambert,
I am Carson Dyle.
Obviously I didn't die in Yugoslavia.
Came mighty close, though.
When I asked you
about Dyle, you...
- You were describing yourself.
- That's correct, Mrs. Lambert.
I was shot up pretty bad.
Totally incapacitated.
Check on Dyle!
Unlike the others,
Charlie knew I was still alive.
He's dead!
- Chief!
- Chief!
But he told them
I was dead.
Dyle is dead!
Took the money and ran.
My God.
A farmer
and his family found me.
He was a Muslim.
His wife Christian.
They hid me,
got me to a hospital...
where a great little lady doc
put me back together.
And you've been tracking
Charlie Lake ever since.
I located him in Paris.
- Reinvented as
"Charles Lambert."
- He got wind of you?
I always told myself
I'd give Charlie
the benefit of the doubt.
I wouldn't kill him
if he gave back the money.
So long as he didn't lie.
And you did kill him?
He did lie.
Charles never told
the truth about anything.
None of you do.
Mr. Dyle. I'm really moved
that you want the O.D.C.
To get their money back.
I always complete
my assignments.
However, we still don't have
the missing funds.
And you've got blood
all over your hands.
Is it your intention
to arrest me?
- Look.
One of eight known
remaining,
inverted U.S.
"Teddy Nickels"...
X.F. grade, 1928.
The legendary
Algerian Oran 60,
original slash mark
intact, 1952.
And the true masterpiece,
the mahogany Urate Lornis,
Madagascar 1906.
The most valuable
postage stamp on
the face of the earth.
There you are, Investigator.
My work is done.
Just hand that over now, Reggie.
It's U.S. Government property.
- Reggie!
Re...
- I don't believe you just did that.
I do.
Whoa!
Carson Dyle?
Police.!
Restez calme.
- Personne ne bouge.!
- Dessalines, doucement.
You look like hell,
II-Sang Lee.
Here for you, Chief.
Carson.
Mr. Dyle.
Question.
Okay?
You didn't happen to bump
into Zadapec on the 11:20
to London yesterday, did you?
Check on Dyle.!
Dyle is dead.!
- Chief!
- That is correct.
- I see.
Were you outside the Tango Palace
when Lola bought it?
- Chief!
- No!
- That was most unfortunate.
You've lost a lot.
None of it's coming back.
What's your point, Bartholomew?
You still have
your honor, Carson.
I've got a suggestion.
Tony?
Eric?
Put 'em down.
Chief.
See you in court,
Commandant.
It will be my pleasure.
You're under arrest
for the murder
of Charles Lambert.
On y va.
Shit!
Morning, Ernie.
Good morning,
Mr. Bartholomew.
Bonjour.
Bonjour,
Mr. Bartholomew.
Here are your messages.
Your mom called.
Hey, is that for me?
Is everything okay,
Mister "B"?
Miss Hoskins?
Yes, sir?
Some tea, please?
Coming right up, sir.
Thank you.
Hey, boss.
How are you, Chief?
Good job, guys.
Ah, non, non, monsieur...
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew.
She's okay.
Come in. Please.
Well, well, well.
"Bartholomew."
You can call me Lewis.
This is for you, Lewis.
My late husband's minor fortune.
- Mm-hmm.
- What? But before? The fire?
Laser copies, courtesy
of Commandant Dominique.
Thank you, Reggie.
I'm not a thief.
I know.
So long, Lewis.
Quitter.
You give up
awful easy, don't you?
Not really.
Please.
Don't go. I hated deceiving you.
I'm so sorry.
Please.
All that time,
you should have trusted me!
Revealing my true identity
was never an option, Reggie.
But I never tried
to hide my feelings for you.
Oh! Lewis, what
are you really like?
There's only one way to find out.
Why should I?
Because I love you.
What?
I love you, Reggie.
And...
You've got to be kidding!
No. Never.
Oh, you're luckier
than you realize, Lewis.
Why?
'Cause I was about to walk
out of your life for good.
And the crazy thing is...
Yes?
I would have regretted
that for...
several weeks, probably.
