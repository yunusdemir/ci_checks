Marge!
What the hell are you doing here?
They said he'd be coming tonight.
- Fuck, get out of here.
- No.
Oi! Piss off.
Why's he got a bag on his head?
You can't do that!
Marge. Didn't you hear me the first time?
Fuck off.
Fuck off yourself.
Sit tight, freak.
<i> Welcome to the Louse Institute </i>
<i> Lost </i>
<i> Lock the door </i>
<i> You cannot leave without a pass </i>
<i> Stay away </i>
Whoo! Wet.
Are you Schumaker?
Ah, yes.
- Got any weapons on you?
- No.
Wait here.
Go in.
Doctor Marlowe.
Doctor Schumaker.
You're late.
Sorry, I got lost.
The route's well sign-posted.
Yeah well, it's raining.
I must have turned off...
It's also well lit.
I've read your papers.
I've also followed the
McCulloch trial quite thoroughly.
I know all about you.
- How you operate.
- I got results.
You got publicity.
Have I done something to offend you,
or do I just offend you?
How many assessments like this
have you done before?
I didn't ask to be here,
Doctor Marlowe.
Your patient has requested
an independent assessment.
I've been trying to treat him for six years.
If you think you can storm in here...
Well I'm sorry you feel that way.
But your patient has requested this.
And he requested me. Simple as that.
Now, I'm against the clock as it is,
so if you don't mind...
I'd like to get started.
Marge!
You're the new one, eh?
You've come to talk to him, eh?
Marge, you know you don't belong
in this wing.
He'll get inside your head.
- Just like he's got into...
- Marge!
The Ugly's going to like you.
Oh, so pretty.
No!
Marge! This is not the sort of behaviour
I expect from you.
Give her two shots of 3V.
If she doesn't calm down,
feed her some Nerak.
Sorry about that.
She raves, but I've never seen
her attack anyone before.
Maybe she's read some of
my papers too.
Simon?
This is Doctor Schumaker.
She's here for your assessment.
We spoke about that before.
Do you remember?
Do you want me to stay here
with you?
I'll just be in the next room.
Just through there.
If you need me.
Okay?
Mr. Cartwright,
I'm Doctor Schumaker.
Do you know why I'm here?
All right?
- Thank you, but we'll be fine.
- We're supposed to be here.
- Well, I'd prefer it if...
- They always sit in on these.
I don't mind.
Where was I?
Doctor, do you have a first name?
Karen.
I have one request.
I've talked to a lot of
you people.
Please, don't treat me
like a fool.
Well, Simon, I think
I can do that.
And while we're on the subject
of etiquette,
I'd appreciate it if when you talk
to me you'd look at me, please.
Sorry.
Old habits.
"I did it because...
I killed them because..."
"I'm The Ugly."
Do you remember saying that?
That's what I told
the police.
So, tell me?
I enjoyed killing.
Is that it?
Isn't that enough?
People who kill repeatedly
tend to have patterns.
Same race, similar age,
certain physical characteristics.
But some were people you knew,
and some weren't.
And you never kept
any mementoes.
You killed men
and women.
- No pattern.
- No pattern.
Compulsive killing
with no pattern.
Helen Ann Millar.
Do you remember her?
What are they doing?
Hi. My name's Helen.
Just sitting over at the bar
with my friend.
Well, we're having a little bet.
I mean, this is a bit embarrassing
for me, because
I don't even normally do anything
like this, but...
We were just wondering if you
were that guy off that TV show?
Simon?
I mean...
Do you think she's laughing at you?
I mean, making fun of you?
So do you want to?
It's not that far.
Let's talk about your childhood.
Why?
I'm sure it's all down there.
What's written down,
and what really happened
is sometimes different.
Tell me about Evelyn.
You mean my mum.
Hello, sweetheart.
There, sweetheart.
- Carl...Carl...Carl...
- Give me that!
Eat your dinner.
Who are you?
Apparently, I'm his doctor.
How can I help you,
Doctor?
Have it been touched any?
No, it's all been tagged
and bagged on the table.
Hey, Simple Simon.
- You're walking home again by yourself, you little poof...
- They picked on you?
- You got no friends.
- Where are your friends, Simon?
What happened when
they chased you?
Can we take these off?
Simon, you know the rules.
Even if I wanted to,
I don't have the keys.
Please. I haven't hurt anyone
in six years.
Says here you attacked
an orderly.
He burnt me with
a cigarette.
He's in a wheelchair now.
How can I trust you, Simon?
You said it yourself,
you enjoy killing.
I don't want to hurt you, Karen.
Yeah...what did Thelma say?
Nah, just some guy. He's coming
for the job, I think.
Sit down. Take a seat.
You're joking.
What?
Later.
I'm sorry about that.
I've come about the
cleaner's job.
Oh, my God!
Come in.
Mum bandaged me up,
and then put me to bed.
I could hear them.
Mum didn't like Julie.
Well, they were chasing him and throwing
his bag around, and then they took off.
Well, who were they?
I'm going to go ring the school
and have them expelled.
I don't know.
I think one of them was Roland.
Roland who?
I don't know his last name.
Well, thank you for bringing him home.
You can go now.
- Can I say goodbye?
- He needs to rest.
I'll tell him
you said goodbye.
Would you just give him this?
Could you get him to call me
when he's feeling better?
<i> Simon: She never did give me that number. </i>
But I got it out of the bin.
And then one day, when mum was at work,
I rang her.
<i> Turn to the right. </i>
What are you doing home?
Fainted at school.
Come here.
Oh, look at you.
My poor baby.
Oh, I love you.
Oh, I love you so much.
You know, I won't leave you.
I won't leave you the way he did.
Oh, look at you.
You hungry?
Do you want something to eat?
I got my school photo today.
Did you?
Let's have a look then.
Look what you bloody well did!
Get out.
It's a baby's book!
He can't read.
Can you, Simple Simon?
- He's dic...dislec...
- Dyslexic, you dummy.
<i> Roland: And the other ducklings
would have nothing to do with him </i>
<i> Roland: Whenever he would swim over,
they would make fun of him! </i>
You got into a fight that day.
Haven't you been listening?
Refresh my memory.
People pick on me.
People pick on me.
I don't slice them ear to ear.
Maybe you should.
Fuck!
Can't you take a joke, man?
Motherfucker!
That's enough for tonight.
It's late.
You can continue in the morning.
Take him to his room now.
Here, I want you to take this.
What is it?
It's a security card. Access through
most doors, in and out.
And this.
It's a beeper.
I should've had
longer with him.
Then perhaps you should have
arrived here earlier.
I need time.
I need more time.
Look, I'm getting him on side.
I didn't notice.
What are the chances of having him
unrestrained tomorrow
without the guards?
How about a straight razor?
You never know, he might want to shave.
I can't read him as easily
as if he was free to move.
Free to move across the room
and snap your neck.
I'm asking you, please.
Lock him in to start with,
if he's calm and controlled,
then I'll free him.
He's not going to attack me. He knows
he won't get out then.
If I say yes, and he does
try something?
It's on my head.
Ah, yes. You can be sure of that,
Doctor Schumaker.
Gonna put me in a wheelchair,
Ugly?
Say your prayers, Ugly.
God hates a coward.
Goodnight, Karen.
Here's your breakfast,
Ugly.
You forgot the secret sauce.
Coffee?
Or Cappuccino?
What the hell is going on in here?
The patient spilled his coffee,
I was helping him clean it up.
Outside.
If I find any evidence that this patient
has been mistreated by you
or anyone else on this staff,
I will slap so many
investigators on this place
it will hum like a beehive.
Do you understand?
What's going on here?
Nothing.
I'm going to start now.
Try the lemon curd.
It's good.
Thank you.
What do you want?
Can you take this away,
please?
How did you sleep?
My sleep was fine.
How was yours?
So what do you want, Karen?
That's a loaded question.
No, it's not. I know
why you're here.
This works out for you,
there'll be more publicity.
Maybe even another promotion.
Just like the McCulloch trial.
Well, we're not here
to talk about that.
Well, after what you
did to Roy McCulloch.
<i> McColluch trial
will not die </i>
I told you, we're not
going to talk about that.
- Got you a promotion.
- Got me a divorce.
What happened?
I'm sure you've read about it.
You said you'd get him off,
and you did.
You convinced the whole courtroom,
and he walked.
I did what was right.
Don't be so coy.
Your face was everywhere.
Talk shows, radio, magazines.
You became quite the celebrity.
My office was broken into, vandalised.
I got death threats.
Let's not forget your divorce.
I admire you.
I wish I could say the same.
Simon, look at this photo.
That's my father.
Hi, Simon!
I was just passing, so I thought
I'd see if you were home.
These need water.
Where's your mum?
She's at work.
Cool.
Hey, what's this?
Look at this.
Did you think you could
hide this from me, did you?
Did you?
Look at this.
Do you know who that is?
- Daddy.
- That's right.
It's your father.
And he's evil.
He's a devil, do you hear me?
You took this from the bin,
didn't you?
Do you know why I put it there?
Because he sent it.
And you want to hear what he said?
He says he's going to kill us.
He says, "I'm going to kill you
and that ugly son of yours"
"Because I hate you"
"And I'm gonna come back and get you
if you don't watch it"
"'Cause that's why I left you,
because I hate you!"
So, if anyone asks you if you
wanna go and live with him, you say no.
You say you wanna
stay with me.
Do you understand?
Do you understand!
Simon... Can you read this?
Simon, don't be ashamed.
This is really important.
Have you read this?
No.
It's from your dad.
It says here that... [door slams]
He'd written to mum
telling her of his intention to
file for my custody.
He wanted to take me off her.
He was rich.
Seemed like he had a pretty good chance.
And Julie told you this?
No.
She never had the chance.
What the hell is going on here?
- Mum, wait!
- Sit down!
Get out of my house.
And don't you ever
come and see my son again.
- What did she tell you?
- Nothing.
You're not going to see her again.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Do you understand!
I said yes!
Simon, wait!
Can we take these off?
Simon, you know I can't.
They're hurting.
Okay, Simon.
If I take them off,
what are you offering?
How can I trust you?
I won't try anything.
I won't try anything.
Simon, do you hear me?
The orderlies are just outside.
I won't try anything.
Can I have some paper?
Sure.
How did you pick your victims?
Different ways.
Why did you kill her?
I've already told you.
No, you've told me how.
I asked you why.
Why did you kill her?
I killed them because I had to.
Why did you think you had to?
Because I heard voices.
- I know all this, Simon. The Ugly would talk.
- That's right.
- No!
What do you mean no?
Serial killers get a sense of
control from the killings.
I'm not a serial killer!
You're not crazy, either.
I heard voices. It's not
uncommon in post trauma cases.
You've seen others.
Do you hear voices?
- I heard voices.
- The Ugly's voice?
- Yes, I heard voices.
- More than one voice?
What's the difference?
I hear voices!
You mean "heard", Simon.
What's the fucking difference?
I hear voices.
Who, Simon?
The Visitors.
What?
They'd come to me.
Who are The Visitors?
The people I've killed.
And where are The Visitors now?
Doctor Schumaker.
Outside, please.
- He has never said anything like this before.
- I don't know what you're trying to do...
I'm trying to help him.
He's leading you on a wild goose chase.
No, this is the truth.
He once told me he thought he was
being pursued by Russians.
It was during the Olympics.
He told us they wanted
to assassinate him.
We knew he was suffering from
acute paranoia,
and possibly even schizophrenia
at the time.
He told us the assassins were
members of the Olympic team.
So we bought a television at his request
so we could identify the killers.
We spent two weeks watching him, monitoring his every move,
noting every statement.
Then, when it was all over,
he admitted he simply wanted
to watch the diving.
He was lying. And it was a hell
of a joke!
He's not lying now!
Don't be so sure.
I'm going to go back in there and
see what else you people have overlooked.
- He's drawing you in.
- He thinks he is.
At least I'm getting somewhere with him.
She'd driven away the one thing
that I cared for.
I bled from her beating.
But I didn't care.
I knew the worst that she could do to me
was what she had just done.
But The Ugly said that I
could do worse.
Much worse.
Standing there, looking at
my bandaged face...
...they started talking to me.
Telling me what to do.
What needed to be done,
and how to do it.
Guiding me.
So what did you do?
I listened.
The UGLY
Would you like a drink?
Hey. You're getting off the subject.
Sorry.
What happened?
That was the night
you killed her.
I took a razor from
the bathroom cabinet.
And I killed her as she slept.
How did you feel when you killed her?
I felt free.
How did it feel to be free from her?
I wasn't.
You just said you were.
I said I thought I was.
Simon, what do you mean?
What did you do after
you killed her?
I tried to burn down the house.
I told the police that
a man had broken in,
trying to kill mum and me.
I made up a fake description
and everything.
I figured it would work.
The Ugly figured it would work.
What did the police do?
They knew I'd done it.
I was young.
I spent four years in
a psychiatric unit.
I came out when I was seventeen.
Did you start to get worried
when these got put up around town?
Not really.
Why?
I was always going to get caught.
But the police were having
a hard time finding you.
You were being very clever.
And elusive.
So why this?
Why let this one live?
She gave the police
my description.
They put them all over town.
Everywhere I went, I saw my face.
But it wasn't The Ugly.
The eyes were wrong.
Why let her live?
Because she was like me.
Why did you do that?
I don't like looking at it.
Why not?
I just don't.
Just reminds me of everything.
We'll put it away then.
Simon, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Tell me some more about Julie.
What happened?
He was hit by a car, I think.
Doctor, could you come out here
right away?
Yours?
- No, I didn't hit him.
- No, I mean, is he your dog?
I just found him.
Stay there, I'll need some
information from you.
No, I've got to go.
Wait, it won't take long.
Can I just have a name, please,
for our records.
Look, is that really necessary?
He's not even my dog.
Simon Cartwright.
It's me, Julie.
I'd recognize that face of yours anywhere.
How's that old battle-axe mother of yours?
Dead.
Oh. Sorry.
Look, I've got to go.
Simon, wait!
I'm sorry about what I said
about your mother.
I didn't mean to upset you.
It's not that.
Well, at least let me buy you a drink,
to apologise.
Still shy, eh?
Okay, well... Give us a ring
tomorrow about the dog. Okay?
Okay.
Shit.
Hi. How are you?
I sat there for an entire day,
trying to figure out what to do.
Shit! My wallet.
Alex! It's me.
I forgot my wallet.
Alex, have you seen my wallet?
Alex, you in there?
Have you fallen asleep
in the bath or something?
Help!
Oh, Clive! Jesus, I can't believe this...
She disappeared for a week.
Went on holiday or something, I guess.
But I kept an eye on her house,
and the Vets.
Then one night she came back.
I keep asking why.
Why?
You hadn't seen him
for a long time.
Maybe he had some sort of
dodgy connections?
Are you kidding me?
He was a staunch Christian,
he didn't even drink.
Believe me, I know my brother.
He's as straight as a dye.
I'll have to get used to saying "knew".
I "knew" my brother.
Can I help you?
I've come to see Julie.
Well, I'm sorry,
I don't think she wants
to see any visitors just now.
It's okay, Frank.
Simon, what are you doing here?
If it's about the dog,
I'm afraid we had to put it down.
It's okay.
<i> Simon: We talked for a while. </i>
And eventually I asked her out.
And?
We met a week later,
for dinner.
How did dinner go?
I'm glad I came tonight.
This is really what I needed. A good night out.
How do you use these things?
You okay?
Why are you upset, Simon?
They're here.
And?
They want me to kill her.
What did you do after dinner?
I took her home.
Until then,
none of your victims had been
sexually assaulted.
- Neither was she.
- But you slept with Julie.
Was it the first time you'd
ever been with a woman?
Yes.
What happened after dinner?
We sat and we talked in the car.
She told me how scared she was
to be alone.
How she'd been staying with her mother
since Alex's murder.
How did you feel about that?
Knowing you'd committed it?
I wasn't sorry for what I'd done.
It was on their instructions.
The Visitors?
Are you sorry now?
- Yes and no.
- Yes and no?
I'm sorry for what I did.
But I had to.
Why?
'Cause I fucking have to, all right!
You already said that.
Why?
Because if I don't, they won't
fucking leave me alone.
They won't fucking leave me alone
until I go out and...
Okay.
Keep talking about the date.
I killed her too.
Why?
She was different. She wasn't
a random victim.
<i> Simon: I had to.
Karen: The visitors told you to. </i>
<i> Karen: Simon, you're just going round
and round in circles. </i>
And when exactly did the police catch you?
That night.
The neighbour heard the screams
and called the cops.
<i> Stay still, you fuck! </i>
Who are The Visitors?
- My victims.
- Your victims?
And do they all come visiting
together?
All of them.
Is it like a big picnic?
Don't fucking belittle me.
Then stop trying to bullshit me.
You're visited by a bunch of dead corpses.
And you keep killing,
so there's more of them to harass you next time!
Just stop.
What's inside your head?
- Just fucking stop!
- Victims, Simon.
Girls as young as seventeen.
Men.
Hitchhikers, young boys.
People want to know.
If you're going to trial, you're going to
face a lot more difficult questions
than the ones I'm asking you.
In the court room,
you can't hide behind being crazy.
After all, you're fit to
stand trial, aren't you?
It's what you want.
And they're going to want to know why.
Are you the sick bastard they think you are?
You did it because
you liked killing?
It's what you told me,
isn't it?
The families of the people you killed
aren't going to accept that.
And neither am I.
Come on, Simon!
Tell me why!
We have been here two days, Simon,
and you have not said why.
Talk to me! I want to know, Simon!
- Kill the bitch.
- Just stop!
You talk to me!
Stop pushing me!
Talk to me! Simon!
Why did you kill them?
Stop!
Kill the bitch!
Oh, fuck you!
She deserves everything she gets.
I was happy
for the briefest moment.
Where are they now?
Do you still see them?
You have no idea what it's
like for me.
Why don't you tell me?
You couldn't possibly know
what I go through.
Come back to bed.
I want to know what you go through.
What do you want do to?
- Kill the bitch.
- Kill the bitch.
What?
What is it, Simon?
They won't leave me alone
until I've done it.
Each time,
they make it harder, and harder,
and harder not to.
Until I have to do it.
What do you have to do?
Kill the bitch.
What?
Look inside my head.
Ugly...
Come on, freak.
That's all for today, yes?
Go on. Try it on me.
Try what you tried on
that fucking bitch. Try it on me.
What happened in there?
He attacked me.
That's what happened.
You provoked him.
You provoked him,
and if you use it against him
I will fight you myself.
I should still go to the board,
and let them know
the appalling manner with which
you treated him.
I told you not to let him
draw you in.
Did you see them?
What?
Did you see something?
No, you said, "did you see them"?
What have you seen?
Oh, I've seen a lot of things.
I'll be filing my report
next week.
- I'll send you a copy.
- Don't bother.
I think I know what the board will say.
The profile of Simon Cartwright...
...unfit for release.
Time for bed,
mewkie.
Is that offer still open?
To try on you what I tried
on that bitch.
...a very clever young man...
She deserved it.
We have to notify the police.
One of our patients has gone.
Will you put me to bed?
Of course I will.
Simon?
Simon, wait.
It's The Visitors.
I can help you.
They're not real.
It's all right, Karen.
I'm cured.
No!
