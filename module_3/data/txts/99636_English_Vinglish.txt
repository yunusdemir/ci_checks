Which one is your classroom?
7 A... this one?
Which one is your seat?
Not seat... desk... second last row
You sit so far back?
lt doesn't make a difference...

That's really far back...
Hi Sapna...
Hi Rupal!
Hello hello!
l'm Neelam...
commonly known as
Rupal's mother these days
l'm... Sapna mother... Shashi
How nice to meet you Shashi
But l have a bone to pick with you
Every time that Rupal
comes to eat at your house
she comes back home and tells me
l have to learn how to cook from you
No aunty... even your food is...
fantabulous!
What a sweet little liar
But you must invite
me home soon Shashi...
then you and l can sit and
gossip about these Siamese twins
Yes... yes aunty...
please come... anytime!
Mom, you wanted to use the loo right?
So nice to meet you Shashi
Bye... see you soon.
What loo?
Come come come...
please sit inside...
l'll be just a minute...
ls this your English teacher?
Yes... Father Vincent...
my class teacher...
Yes Sapna...
How are you?
Mrs. Godbole right?
Pleasure to meet you
How's Mr. Godbole?
Fine... very fine
So... Sapna...
what should we start with?
As l had discussed with
Mr. Godbole at the last PTA...
Sapna's performance
continues to be excellent...
Sir... sorry... father...
my English not good
lf you don't mind...
... can we talk in Hindi?
Of course Mrs. Godbole...
Hindi is our national Language...
we should all speak in it...
but... my Hindi not very good...
is that okay?
No problem!
l am from Kottayam district you see...
Kottayam... that's in Kerala right?
lt's famous for its
banana wafers right?
Do you like them?
Very much!
Next time l go l...
l'll bring back a big
packet of chips for you
ls she doing well in her studies?
Of course...
she is one of the top
5 students of our class
She could rank first...
if she showed more interest in Physics
But is her English good?
Her English is excellent
Mrs. Godbole...
she is one of our brightest students
But is she respectful?
Does everyone like her?
Sapna... you haven't told
your mum about your fan club?
Bu Mrs. Godbole,
l wanted to talk to you about...
... this inter-school quiz competition
Sapna has been chosen...
Sapna has 'choosen' for the school...
been 'choosed'...
Has been chosen!
l warned you about my Hindi
She will need to stay back
an extra hour in school...
for practice sessions...
Sir... l have already
spoken to my dad about this...
and there is no problem
Yes but you haven't
spoken to your mum...
Ma'am, l need your permission please
Not a problem father...
our school must win
Although the Coffee Day
business will suffer a bit
Thank you Mrs. Godbole...
l'll see you at the next PTA meeting?
And don't forget the banana chips
Of course not...
Thank you sir
Everything went well right?
Banana chips!
ls Father Vincent your uncle?
Father Vincent was so kind...
... so polite...
he said something in jest...
and l went along with it
He didn't seem to mind at all...
he made me feel so comfortable...
by talking in Hindi
And you made him
feel so uncomfortable...
... by talking in Hindi
''ls Sapna a good girl...
does everyone love her''...
And why joke about Cafe Coffee Day...
Dad should have been there...
and you were talking in Hindi...
even to Rupal's mother
Each time l had to answer for you
What happened?
Failed her exams?
l'm the one who's failed
Meaning?
l have embarrassed her today
All teenagers feel their mom
and dad are an embarrassment
Not mom and dad...
just mom
Why are you so upset?
Tell me...
why did you marry me?
What can l say...
one look at you and l was hooked!
lsn't there any water?
Why didn't you marry a modern woman?
lf l gave it so much thought
why would l get married at all...
lt's a joke Shashi... come on...
What's come over you?
No matter how hard l try...
l just can't seem to please anyone
Sapna's just a child
And you?
Hello...
Manu!
Hi... how are you?
Yes l know you
sisters chat regularly...
but what about me
So how is New York?
When are you coming to lndia?

Sorry mom...

Not going to school?
Cousin Meera is getting married
To an American in New York...

You have to make a passport?
Yes you have to...
Tomorrow l'll start

since you need to leave before us
And us?

Fine... you'll be
thrown out of school...

What?
l've never travelled alone...
how will l manage?
What alone!
A hundred people will be
with you on the flight
Let me take Sagar...
No it's not a good idea...
you won't be able to manage
Don't l do it here?
But that's America...
it's a foreign land...
you can't even speak English well
Will you be happy...
3 weeks without me?
Shashi lf l was you...
l would be at the airport right now
Maaji... how do l go?
lt's a matter of a few days...
everyone will join you anyway
She is your only sister...
she's all alone there...
first wedding in the family...
who else will she turn to for help?
And l'm here anyway...
Problem?
Yes... a really big problem
Will you manage without me?
Yes... few Beyblades...
that Tron game...
Ben 10...
and many Hot Wheels cars...
if l get all this l will manage
And how do you do that thing?
O my dear...
my heart doesn't beat without you
My heart... it feels a twitch
How do l go to a foreign land?
My heart...
My heart trembles... quivers
l am afraid
O my dear...
my heart doesn't beat without you
My heart... it feels a twitch
How do l go to a foreign land?
Do you embrace
all your colleagues so fondly?
lt was a hug Shashi
Are the two of you very close?
That's just a way of saying hello...
it doesn't mean we are close
Everybody hugs... it's normal!
We are close right...
maybe that's why we never hug!
Sometimes my heart beats faster
My left eye flickers
Will you forget me... l wonder
l know you through and through
l know you more than you
Will your eye wander... l wonder
So ma'am... what do you do?
Making... making snacks...
Snacks?
You know you are not
allowed to bring food articles
into the United States of America?
Food... food articles...
My English... weak...
So ma'am how will you
manage in our country...
if you don't know English?
Like you are managing in our
country without knowing Hindi!
These nights these days
Your words and ways
l will miss them so...
Your slights and spite
The way you hold me tight
Makes me pine for more...
Why don't you stop me?
O don't let me go!
One mention of you...
l worry... l'm wary...
l think of you...
Mama come fast... it's late!
My heart...
My heart trembles... quivers
l am afraid
Mom...
not possible to say goodbye
without crying in lndia, right?
She's crying so much
Shashi...
when the immigration guys ask you...
''What is the purpose of your visit?''
what will you say?
''l am going to sister's
place to attend wedding''
Good!
And ''What's the duration of
your stay?''

remembering purpose...
towels...
bowels...
and... vowels!
Correct?
Now, when a word
begins with a vowel...
like apple...
begins with a vowel 'a'...
we say 'an' apple
'An' orange...
'An' idiot
So l...
an Eva?
No... if it's a name...
or a proper noun...
we just say Eva...
not an Eva...
or the lndia
Okay?
Just Eva... just Rama
Yes Shashi?
Why lndia not 'the lndia'
and why America
''the United States of America''?
That is a very good question Shashi...
and we will come to that once
we do the class on
the various forms of nouns
What a question you asked madam!
David sir had no answer...
full confusion
Good question...

Sleeping again
We are smarter than these people...
we struggle only because
of this bloody English...
else we would have blown them away
What you say?
l say l come to your parlour...
you give me free hair cut...
and l teach you free Urdu
You come to parlour...
l shave your head!
Spicy noodle...
just like dragon!
Excuse me...
