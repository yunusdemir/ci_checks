- The Senate
Armed Services Committee
meets today
to receive testimony
on the privatization
of the war on terror.
The purpose
of this hearing
is to discuss
what's gone wrong,
and to seek solutions
that will enable us
to bring
our troops home.
Director Owens.
- Thank you, Senator Buchanan.
We've asked the head
of private military firm
Blackfalls to speak
with us today.
We're honored to hear
from Mr. David Ramsey,
who has served our country
honorably in uniform.
Mr. Ramsey?
- Thank you, Director Owens.
I appreciate the opportunity to
testify here today, because...
our nation is tired.
Tired of endless war,
of endless sacrifice.
This fatigue has only made
our nation less safe.
Just a few days ago,
the CIA allowed
one of the top threats
to our security to escape.
- Correct.
Now, I don't
blame the CIA.
They are simply trying to do
too much with too little.
By any metric of history,
time, or money,
the war on terror
is a disaster.
Afghanistan
is a quagmire,
16 years of futility.
So, gentlemen,
I am here to propose
a radical, more
cost-effective solution...
PMCs.
If a private military company,
like Blackfalls,
were handling renditions
and security abroad,
the escape of Zamani
never would have happened.
Why?
Because we can deploy
better-trained soldiers,
saving the government
both money and lives.
We can send operators
into Afghanistan
and finally bring
our troops home.
- Mr. Ramsey,
I completely disagree.
I don't think we should
be fighting
our wars with mercenaries.
But my men
are not mercenaries.
They are
former service members,
who continue to serve
this administration,
this nation, honorably.
Gentlemen...
the definition of insanity
is doing the same thing
over and over again
and expecting
a different result.
- What would
you do differently?
- It's time to take
the gloves off.
I believe we need
a viceroy in Afghanistan,
someone who can
oversee operations
and protect American lives.
It's a position
that I believe
I am uniquely qualified
to fill.
All I'm asking is that
you allow me and my men
to continue to serve
this great nation
and the people
who love her.

soon enough.

- This whole Zamani debacle's
a major embarrassment.
We need to beef up
security abroad.
But the President
has gone on record
saying he won't commit
more troops to the Middle East.
- You've had the most
experience with PMCs, Jim.
What's your take on this?
- Well, some of them
have done some good work
for us in the past.
Look, I'm not opposed
to using PMCs for--
renditions
and private security abroad.
But I'm just not
comfortable with the idea
of replacing our soldiers
with mercenaries.
- Neither am I.
Let me be clear, gentlemen.
As long as I
am on this committee,
it's simply not
going to happen.
- Which brings me back
to my earlier question.
What do we
tell the President?
- Up the reward
on Zamani.
If Ramsey's mercs
can clean this mess up,
then maybe we can discuss
a larger role later.
- Which will be
asking for trouble.
PMCs are unregulated.
They don't follow
the same rules of engagement.
Are we prepared for
another bloodbath
like the one we had in Iraq?
- It's a valid concern.
- I've dealt with David Ramsey.
He's a ruthless, amoral SOB
looking to profit
from our wars.
Quite frankly, I wouldn't
be surprised if he was using
this Zamani catastrophe simply
to further his own agenda.
- That's quite
an accusation, Senator.

I'm off to Turkey,

Et voilà.
Just don't ask me

I don't want to get
blown up or shot at.

in the wrong trade.
It's an interesting

It's kind of like

I just tracked
Mills' new phone.
He's right near the Blackfalls
Facility her in Ankara.
- I need, uh,
medical bags.
- Sure, he didn't take any.
- Yeah, go figure.
I need two.
No, definitely three.
- You can handle this.
- That's my jam.
Let's dance.
- Don't do that, please.

We know where you are

guys he has in there, okay?
Why don't you wait
for some backup?

me and him now.

Hart would say
"be smart," right?

taken down in an explosive

Private military

produced DNA evidence

a good plan comes together.
You're welcome to hitch a ride

Collect your fair share

you were the best.
He's old-school,

We all know.
It's time to take

Whatever it takes.
The way we

I should have

I'll get the chance.

to cover up a massacre.
Now is that the kind of man
you want to die for?
No.
So you get yourself downstairs
and help your buddies
who weren't
as lucky as you.
Go!

without a hitch...
Except this Mills.

And he's coming.

Bring Ramsey to justice.
Gonna need your help

But there's a standing offer

Afghanistan, Sudan.

And with a lower profile.
Big-time contracts.

They knew what he was.

They need a job.

War is money.
And we're gonna
