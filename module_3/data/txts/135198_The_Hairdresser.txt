Election night, March 24, 1994
Any bets on the results?
A hundred we go over 70%.
- Cut it out!
Betting brings bad luck.
- The socialists will loose.
You'll see that this time we will win.
- This time we're gonna bust ass.
The first results confirm projections
favoring the Right Coalition.
The new senate looks as follows:
32.6 percent for the progressive party...
pact for Italy 15.2 percent, party
What a shitty country!
Unbelievable!
And you even made alliance with
those Christian Democratic deadbeats
for results like these!
Your Orchetto is a genius.
How is it Orchetto's fault?
All you do is criticize.
Go fuck off!
I'm getting sick. - You will be sick.
Don't piss me off
or I'll make you spit your teeth!
Just try!
And I'll flatten your nose!
Come here if you dare, red idiot
- You talk like a fascist.
Fascist?! Come here!
Never once a broken nose
or black eye or blood.
You'll feel sorry for that! - They are all
celebrating their victory!
Better to avoid provocations.
We'll show them
who won the elections.
Where're you going to? - I'll come too.
We're still Italy's second largest party.
I'll give those apes a victory celebration!
- Damn those dickhead "Leghisti!"
Come on, let's go. They don't scare us.
Get out of the way! - I'll gonna
kick your ass. - Where are you going?
Like little boys.
- Where you're driving to? - Long live Italy!
Watch out.
- Dirty Communist people killer!
You murdering progressive shit!
Dirty communists!
Stop! God dammit!
Are you out of your mind?
Who was it? - The communist pig!
ls she hurt?
They hurt you! It was him!
We'll rip your ass, you "Leghista" scum!
Look, they bashed the fender!
Come here, you can have some more!
Cut it off, slut!
- Let me go or I'll bite you!
I'll rip you to pieces!
The L's are not hard!
Let me go!
- Wait, I'll show you! Let me pass!
Let me pass!
Throw him in too.
She was bashing me.
That pig needs cold water more than me.
No, not me.
No! Leave me alone!
No! Stop it! You pigs!
Now my ID is all wet!
It's all that redhead's fault!
What's the matter?
What's wrong with you now?
The redhead from
the beauty parlour facing the tower?
Yes.
- Just because you've seen her?
No kidding!
- The minute you saw her?
I came close
l didn't just see... I felt.
I fell and banged my head.
and I want to crack her in two.
Maybe it's her hot cheeks
or heavy tits. My hands on her flesh.
She's wiry but packed tight.
Whatever, it was ZAPPO!
Ah "ZAPPO"! Sudden sexual reawakening.
Me and Palmina do it
like crazy. But this one's really
BAM! I mean
the kind that can drive you crazy.
I'm ashamed of myself, because
me and a card carrying redhead Leghista!
Yeah, you the Rifondazione hard-liner
who betrays his convictions.
Who betrays his convictions.
From the waist up you're a leftist.
The waist down, a right-winger. - Bullshit!
I've always screwed thinking of Lenin.
And you always got a hard-on?
You bet!
No shit!
Really?! - Yeah, really.
He really had a hard-on?
- Thank God they threw him into the fountain.
You know his name?
- No, I only know he's a communist.
He was there with a friend.
They were shouting communist stuff.
Hard-liner? - Very HARD!
Imagine! A guy like that.
And there I am biting his ear off
when I noticed his condition.
Too bad I fainted and missed out!
Wait Rosella. They delivered
our leaflets. Aren't they something?
"Beauty Forever" - Pamper
your face at the Beauty Centre
and pamper
your body at the Dance Centre.
Specialized in tangos and belly dancing.
Belly dancing?
The ideal solution
for the mature woman. Very erotic!
I'm quite an expert.
I had an affair with an
Arab Sheikh. - Get real! It was a package
vacation tour to Algeria.
You're bullshitting.
Hello? How many leaflets are you
calculating for a successful campaign?
1500? No! At least 3000!
Hey Tunin! How many pieces today?
50 - as requested. What's your
problem. Did somebody die on you?
The Left Coalition.
Hey Nicola! Tell us who you voted for!
Berlusconi! So stuff it!
Nicola?!
Wasn't Nicola once a Communist fund raiser?
I'm telling you,
we're washed up! Unbelievable!
A beauty, huh? Great car
You can tell it's a work of art.
Hand made.
Piece by Piece. - Oh, really?!
Pretty soon: no more hand-made work.
Just robots.
- Shut up, you fool.
That's no tragedy.
Our major concern won't be work.
The theory of leisure time.
- Oh shit! The leisure time theory again!
Go blow your ass
with a bamboo stick!
What the hell are you saying? - I'm saying,
he should blow his ass with a bamboo stick!
He's being metaphoric -
about bamboo sticks. Here, sign!
Good morning. - Good morning.
Show this guy
the future of the working class.
Yes. But where are the workers?
- Eh, the workers.
Workers aren't needed anymore.
Burning hell!
Then the working class is dead for real!
Yeah, it's dead. - Really dead.
Come and clear the table.
In the first Empire,
400 B.C., every free citizen had <i>8</i> slaves.
They spent their whole time on studies
of comedies, tragedies and poetry.
Typical Prof. Masi.
- 33 slaves for every housewife,
blenders, refrigerators, dishwaters.
Today's mechanical slaves could allow us
to live once again like the ancient Greeks.
Machines work while we enjoy
art, music, painting.
Art? You'd just eat, drink and make merry.
Don't get snippety, because
you already have your 30 slaves. Look!
You see that?
It's worth at least 5 slaves.
5 slaves washing the dishes?!
Yes, ma'am! And the
washing machine is another 5. And the
vacuum cleaner's 6 or 7 slaves.
Even the blender
is a slave or a slave and a half.
Yes, but the slave of all these 30 slaves
is this poor slob!
30 slaves! Who pushes
the vacuum cleaner? Who pushes the waxier?
And the loads, scrubs, disinfects.
The bleacher, the glosser, the softener.
You could save on the glosser.
Why don't you
do our work for one day?
All right,
the working class is dead and gone.
But what about Marx?
At this point Marx is your headache.
All right, all right.
I'll reformulate the question for you.
The working class goes dancing.
But when Mrs Working Class
needs money for pork chops
who coughs up? - Agnelli.
Agnelli? - Yes, Agnelli.
Because of the surplus value product
the machines produce while producing
goes 50% to him.
But the other 50% he forks to us.
Why should he?
Out of the kindness of his heart?
First, because otherwise
we'll rip his ass and trash his factories.
Second, because without
his money, how can we buy his cars?
Him and all the industrialists.
That'd be the day!
Agnelli, De Benedetti and Berlusconi
giving us our paycheques.
While we stay home
in bed, relaxing and enjoying life.!
They'd finance your bedsores!
- Professor Di Maso said so
And I believe
every last word! - Never mind!
Let's watch TV.
Thatâ€™s more fun.
No, Mother of God, no! Not the Goretti!
You know something? I'd give her a bang
and so would a lot of comrades.
She's done it with
all the guys in her party. - Men are all pigs!
Tazio Nuvolari is still the greatest.
His legend still lives on and inspires us.
That's why I named my kid "Tazio".
You know why I feel like
an asshole when you talk about Nuvolari?
Because you are an asshole!
We should've raced like him
with the same enthusiasm.
What's this?
Where's that coming from?
It's the redhead.
Look, the guy from the election night.
So he got informed! He found me.
Of course he got informed.
The plane dropped 2000 leaflets!
You're giving him the eye?!
Sure, why not?
Heaven help me! Men and me right now
I'd rather become a homosexual
after that last extravagant-exotic thing!
Extravagant-exotic!
As if he were Sean Connery in Hawaii!
A corn scraper from Casalecchio!
- You're rotten!
It's called pedicurist.
- Still always a corn-scraper!
You're always putting down my boyfriends.
At least here
at work you'd call him a "pedicurist".
It's him again. - Interesting.
What about you? A blue collar
worker on an bicycle. Great catch!
Great catch!
A worker on a bicycle.
You want to bet that if I apply myself
I'll get him on our bandwagon?
One of these tough communists?
Never! That would be to good to be true.
What better gift to our beloved Senator
than a Rifondazione supporter.
A communist on a silver platter?
All right, why
don't we bet on it? A hundred?
You're on!
Our third time around.
- Shitty Leghists!
Oh God, God, God!
What's the matter?
Mind your own business.
- Jesus, it happened again?
Yeah. Even at a distance?
Damn it!
It's serious, isn't it?
- It's best if I'll see him home. Ciao.
Ciao. We'll see later.
Crazy. Making a fool of me like that.
Do you have to get slaphappy
every time you see that redhead?
Easy. Relax. And straighten up.
No, don't straighten up. Soften up.
Good evening.
How would you like them?
- Fluffed, curled and scattered.
Fine. I'll be with you in a sec.
Shampoo.
Fine.
And what kind
of shampoo would Mr Comrade prefer?
Cactus oil? - The same kind
as your Fascist allies. Castor Oil!
Ha! Allies!
The senator will make them sweat.
Just like he makes you boys sweat.
And he will make Berlusconi sweat.
Because he's the one who bangs the scale.
You mean "tips."
- Tips? No, no, not the Senator.
He bangs.
So let's go with the Castor-oil.
Good choice, Mr. Comrade.
It works wonders on hard-liners like you.
Why does a hard-liner like you want
a shampoo from a reactionary?
An experiment.
Political or - Or.
Or?! Excellent.
So? How's life?
Stop it! Quit breaking my balls!
Go to hell!
But
What a bullshit!
What's going on, Tunin? - Oh, nothing.
What are you doing here? - Did you also
receive an envelope from the company?
I think so. Why? - Disaster!
A tragedy - from one standpoint.
From another it could be
a new dawn for the proletariat.
What are you jabbering?
Unemployment compensation.
What's unemployment compensation?
- It's unemployment compensation.
Are you crazy?
Playing the idiot? The poet?
Holy hell!
Just the two of you? - Six of us.
But didn't you always tell me that you two
were the most specialized and talented?
Yes, we were,
but who knows how they choose?
Maybe they draw
straws or favour the biggest families.
Or maybe political reasons.
- With this unemployment compensation,
what do we make at the
end of the month? - 70% of our pay.
But no work. Free time. - Stop it!
Damn them to hell!
I wanted to show you something.
- And damn the damned world!
Hey do you remember?
What do I care? I don't give a damn!
600 less a month!
That's what I've got on my mind.
What is it?
Don't you remember?
We took it in Orvieto, 1975.
When we went
to Prof. Di Maso's congress.
Mariolina found it
and threw a jealous fit on me.
Well then - rip it.
- No, it's a memory.
You keep it. I don't think Tunin will mind.
- Oh, look how skinny you were.
I did a good job
back then, choosing a juicy one like you.
Anyway, fat or skinny, you'd be on
unemployment compensation just the same!
What?
You're on unemployment compensation?
YOU are!
That is we both are.
We also received
this brown envelope from the company.
Just like mine.
What did you do to your head?
Damn! Don't break my balls.
- Go to hell, you ugly animal!
You brute! You idiot!
You jobless!
And now? - Nothing.
I'm on unemployment
compensation, you ugly whore!
Didn't your party
promise a million new jobs?
Wonderful! Unemployment compensation.
That means that from this moment
your salary's coming from me, the taxpayer.
Because Agnelli and Company profit when
they profit. But when they lose, we pay!
That's why
their newspapers support your party.
What are you saying, bitch?
- The truth, asshole!
Well?
- Don't you start now.
Damn. Unemployment compensation.
Now what do we do?
- I'd start by rinsing my hair.
Zvanin! Zvanin!
Wait. - Papa is still sleeping.
Zvanin, move it, wake up! Out of bed!
Come on, move it! Would you wake up?!
Wake up, you no good! It's 10 o'clock.
What the hell! How about some
grace? You made me smash my butt!
At ten in the morning you want grace?
Yes grace!
My mother made the bed with me inside.
Papa made peepee in bed.
A nocturnal emission.
I dreamt of you
wearing black net stockings.
You know what? You're an idiot.
Come on, let's change
that pig of a daddy's sheets.
Let's hope you don't become like mama.
What's up?
- I was sleeping. You?
I might kill myself.
I'm desperate without work.
D'Alema!
They appointed D'Alema! - Not veltroni?
Why D'Alema? We were all for Veltroni.
Don't you get it? They don't care
about the grass-roots.
What do you mean they don't care? - Of
course they don't care about idiots like you.
That's right. They don't care.
Why should they listen to a
pack of watered-down Social Democrats?
Your leadership
decided and they did well.
Yeah, while you boys venerate Stalin's
whiskers. Now you have D'Alema's moustache.
Anyway I don't care, I'm gonna kill myself.
- Wait, I'll be right down.
What's that pamphlet?
- Poetry, old boy. I discovered poetry.
Mr Ungaretti. Listen to this:
I am brightened by immensity.
And?
- That's it. That's the whole poem.
Oh, fuck off! That was just two words.
A two-word poem?
The Divine Comedy. That's a poem.
Why are we here?
Horse riding.
It works wonders against depressions.
You should try it.
When you get in a funk over
wrench withdrawal.
And you're not into poetry, you come here.
It's easy. The horse does
everything. They are specially trained
to carry jobless people.
Their backs can sense them.
The connection
with the animal is beneficial.
He's got a crazy look. - You've got
a crazy look.
And you're neurotic.
Over the redhead.
And your job.
You're a dope who refuses
to understand the importance
of free time. Because you're ignorant.
Free time is precious.
Look how pretty they are.
They give me the creeps.
Even politically speaking. That's stuff for
English Lords.- Bullshit!
You see
that guy with the yellow shirt?
He's got no drop
of English blood. Works for Pignelli.
He is having a swell time.
Damn!
A real swell time.
Four hours. Go stick it up your ass!
Yes, Wagner's TannhÃ©user was too long.
A masterpiece of Romanticism.
Go stick it, you and Wagner.
Maybe we should've
started with an operetta or a musical.
Stick it, you Wagner and the musical.
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
So, I see a girl, already 4 years old
with a pacifier in her mouth.
I ask: "Why the pacifier?"
She pulls it out and
answers: "Mind your fucking business!"
Okay, so what's that supposed to mean?
That if his parents
didn't work, he'd grow up better.
Let me out, Mr. Pacifier.
The end of work is a great opportunity.
Let me off. I could use a walk.
You have to sleep now!
Tomorrow morning
we'll buy paint and brushes.
We could be two
great painters without even knowing it.
We could be two natural-born Picassos.
Zvanin, you crushed my balls.
-And I'll keep crushing,
because I don't want my friend
to turn into an idiot.
You've dialed
Giacometti Rossella. I'm out.
Leave a message after the beep. Thank you.
I told you not to break my balls!
You are so sexy.
You're a real jerk.
Cut it out. You see, she's with a man.
You're absolutely ridiculous.
Five minutes, okay? Just five minutes.
I saw him.
There was a shadow lurking here.
The alarm went off and he ran. - Oh, good.
It's a bad neighbourhood.
Don't park here. They'll steal it.
So what? I'm insured.
- Yes, but think of all the hassles.
I'm with a redhead fox
you wouldn't believe! What would you do?
I'd go away. - I wouldn't.
Drive carefully, Enrico.
Eleonora and Pucci are waiting for you.
Will your bank give us
the loan for the dance school? Yes or nor?
Oh yes, signorina,
you'll get the royal treatment.
Who?
Is your name "Enrico"?
Eleonora and Pucci
don't know what a pig you are.
Come home, or else
Or else?
Or else what? Son-of-a-bitch!
Roll over and die!
I told you not to break my balls!
I know you're there. You're hiding.
Come out, if you have the guts.
There you are.
What the fuck
do you want? - Me from you?
You're a cheeky bastard, aren't you?
Aren't you married
and with children? Shame on you!
What do I want?!
Weren't you supposed to be moralist?
Beside the fact
that we invented free love,
I don't accept
criticism from a whore like you.
Your brain needs a wash.
You're coming here to talk bullshit.
Leave me alone, you brainless monkey.
Get away! Leave me alone!
I'm calling the police!
You must be out of your mind to keep
bothering me. I'm fed up with that.
Come on you little slut.
You're obsessing
me night and day. Let me go!
You're scaring me!
You chased away
the Director of the Bank of Mantua.
Who'll finance my dance school? You?!
The Director of the Bank of Mantua.
You were putting
out for a bank loan. You disgust me!
You disgust me! Disgust me!!
No, you've lost your head over me.
It's got nothing to do
with my head. You're disgusting.
If anything, it's just sex. Nothing else.
Stop it! - No, I won't!
Are you hurt?
Are you alive?
Give a sign!

Easy, be good - What time is it?
I don't know. Midnight.
Midnight? The rooster's calling.
- He must be running early.
He's always grumpy.
And you know the latest?
He wants to make love at all hours.
When he wanted to marry me,
you know how he proposed?
"Hey dog-face, wanna marry me?"
Well, the other night
he asked me to say "I love you."
We did well to take the initiative.
Though we might be women
we don't know fear.
So, lsolina,
is it clear? Let's recapitulate.
You give us the place
and the license and we do the rest.
Refurbish, modernize,
whitewash. And we run the restaurant.
In a word, we bust our humps
and you live like a lady.
And you rake in 30%.
- Didn't we say 38%?
When it comes
to moolah, you're not at all that deaf.
Alright, 38%.
- But before we start, not a lira.
Well, a promise is better than nothing.
Nothing?
- Now that we've settled, I can tell you.
This place is dead as a cemetery.
That guy is the only customer.
He only eats
the first course and hasn't paid in a month.
So, it's settled?
The contract's valid?
You bet it is!
He's our client now, okay?
Let's go out and take the initiative.
What's this? Who are you?
- The new management.
A few months later on Inauguration Day.
No, goddamnit, no!
You did it behind my back like a traitor!
I told you a thousand times. But the
deafest are those who don't want to hear.
You only wanted to buy dishes.
You didn't talk about me.
The dishes that butter finger
Zvanin is going to drop and break!
Break what? If I break them,
I'll pay for them, you ball breaker!
Now that's enough!
Finish setting the table!
- Are you deaf? I said no! What
do you expect? That a super mechanic
turns into a waiter?
Of course not! He's used
to being waited on hand and foot.
I said no!
And you drop those tagliatelle!
Look at yourself!
Take that rag off!
We have our dignity.
- What are you doing?
Hands off!
He is still my husband!
Put it on again, failure!
Hurry up!
- Will you stop this now!
You're not good for anything!
I'll kill all of you!
No, not the tagliatelle. No!
The clients are coming.
They're even coming from the river.
Look, it's Gino!
Dad Gino's here.

I'm just a client, like any other.
I'm a client, too.
- Give us a hand!
But I help out. - Great!
Congratulations, Palmina.
- There's a reserved table for Enrico Brivio.
The Mantua Bank Director. The Legista.
- No way! Enrico Brivio of the
Bank of Mantua is not welcome here!
If he sets foot here, by God,
I'll smash everything in sight!
- What'll you smash?!
Weren't you just a client?
Listen up! This is not your job,
not your restaurant
and not your business.
So, no politics, just Frogs' legs!
Cut the crap!
Serve the tables and shut up!
What a charming place.
Marvellous! I love it!
No, look, I can't hack this stuff.
We can help out. They are our wives.
Waiter!
Waiter your ass!
Waiter
Sir, did I
offend the comrade metal-worker?
Mr. Brivio, your table's over here.
Make yourself comfortable.
On the right. Far right. Extreme right.
Great start.
- The hors d'oeuvres table is there.
Self service - I warned you that it
would be a den of hard-boiled Bolsheviks.
No, just four poor comrades
consoling themselves
over the end of the Left.
Say a prayer.
You can throw flowers, Miss
but I'll cover him
with a plate of tagliatelle in red sauce.
You do that. And I'll break that melon
over your head! Red, white and green.
Careful, otherwise
- Enough! The tagliatelle are done.
There are two good types of
Mortadella. From Bologna and Modena.
Once I've seen some made from donkey,
from donkey, but I didn't eat it.
Yak, donkey, really?
- Yes, I tell you.
I can see you like it.
Admit it, she's pretty.
No, she's beautiful, beautiful.
I don't get you. You haven't
seen her in three month!
You're a sex maniac. A psychopath!
What the hell am I gonna do with
a ding-dong like you?
You're eating
everything. - Yes, excuse me.
You're also a little vulgar.
I mean
maybe there's a sentiment.
But you're just physical.
I'll fix you.
If you don't stop,
I'll show you who's the boss!
You think
you can push me around?
I'm taking you everywhere
and you keep embarrassing me.
Take this.
Right, left, quick, quick, quick.
Right, left, quick, quick, quick.
I like this dance school
because the girls teach
in tango dresses
instead of those awful sweat suits.
Anitina, let's see
what our muchachos can do.
Pierantoni with Sperlanzani,
Miss Rossi with Knuckles.
You Franchino with Maria Rosa.
Sorry, no more woman.
Sailor, dance with this gentleman.
Sorry, I've got nothing against
the sailor. I want to talk to you.
What about? - Something private.
During my lessons? - Just a minute.
A matter of life or death. - No kidding.
Anitina, carry on
the lesson.lt's something urgent.
So, tell me.
- I don't know, if you remember me.
We met on the election night.
I was with Cavazzui, Tunin.
We fell in the fountain
after you clobbered us.
You remember, right?
You were looking gorgeous.
Well, it's a delicate matter.
Because Tunin is infatuated.
That boy lost his head over you.
Well "boy" he's got a wife and kids.
- Cut it short. You're here
like Alfredo's father in La Traviata.
"Save the family, leave the boy?"
No, no, I've come
to negotiate the exact opposite.
Because he's gone out of
his mind. He's suffering like an animal.
He talks to himself. Well, not exactly
to himself. But something happens.
He is going crazy.
He's got no control over himself any more.
"But what do you mean with ""the opposite""?"
Well, you know,
when someone's obsessed
I mean really obsessed
one shot and he cools off.
He puts it behind him.
It's my initiative.
He doesn't know a thing.
If you would
kindly and courteously
You could be
a little kind to him, couldn't you?
We want to be
kind to him! Anitina
Come here!
Mr. Policeman,
kindly try a whirl with the sailor.
With sensuality. Hot and sensual!
Listen up. To avoid
ruining a family, this gentleman
is asking me
to bang his hard-liner friend.
I didn't say it like that.
- ls it true?
Yes, technically speaking,
but psychologically it's a different matter.
It would be
an act of solidarity. Like volunteer work.
Volunteer work?
I volunteer to send you both to hell!
I didn't mean to offend her.
Don't worry. She's not offended.
Maybe you could give me a hand.
You have a minute? - I have lessons.
I'll enroll. I'll pay.
- All right. Then I'll lead.
I lead!
So, is it
a quick shot or is he madly in love?
In my opinion, he's madly in love.
But maybe a quick shot will work.
I ask you over and over again:
And how and where and when?
And you always answer
- Maybe, maybe, maybe.
You dance so sensually.
That's because your body is so supple!
Oh, what happened?
Oh! the personal computer.
Second hand leasing.
I'll bash it.
I'll smash it. Nothing can stop me.
I tear you up.
I'll slaughter you!
I'll batter it. Destroy it!
Anitina!
Anitina! Are you out of your mind?
Dancing the samba now?!
There now she's crying.
Two maniacs. Two maniacs.
Now, what'll you think of me?
You'll think that I'm but instead
I'm through with men. Never again.
But you
you're so charming. Irresistible.
And now you'll think that I'm a girl
who flings off her panties right away.
But instead I'm sentimental.
I feel like crying.
That I just flopped over.
Not even
I swear, it's the first time I never ever
the second time or the third time.
Do you speak my language? You're silent.
Why are you silent?
I'll go crazy, if you don't talk.
Say something. Anything!
"L am brightened by immensity!"
"I am brightened by immensity!"
No, damn you, no!
How dare you make me
come off like an asshole?!
I did it as a friend. To help you.
Friend, my ass!
You do this, You do that.
No, no, no! You shouldn't have.
How dare you! Who authorized you?
I don't give
a shit about the redhead!
What did she say?
- What she said, what she said?
As for getting pissed off
she got pissed off and sent me to hell.
But - But? - But there was
her friend, her partner, Anitina.
The cute blonde with the blue eyes.
Anitina from Mantua.
And the skyward nipples.
Like the buds of horse chestnuts.
What the fuck are you saying?
- It's a poem by Pitigrilli.
Pitigrilli? - Pitigrilli. The decadent poet.
He always describe tits as "skyward."
- Quit yakking!
Free time made me understand
that there's space for other things.
Along with your wife
you can have a lover.
And me and the Mantua girl
What do I care about the Mantua girl?!
That other redhead Leghista.
What did she say?
For starters, nothing doing
but the Mantua girl
Not again! - Wait, Anitina told me
that there could be a way.
But you said you didn't care.
I don't give a shit. But keep talking.
Short reckoning, long friends!
No blaming ambassadors for bad news.
Don't get pissed off!
I promised to stay calm. Now talk!
Anitina told me
that Rosella has a dream
like Salome and John the Baptist.
A silver platter holding the head of
Tunin the hard-liner that she delivers to Bossi.
I don't get it.
Spell it out for me.
She'll put out for you
if you become a Leghista.
What?! I'll kill you!
Me Leghista?! How dare you?!
You said you'd keep cool. - You're a pimp.
Me, Leghista?
The Communist hard-liner a Leghista!?
I'll murder you. How dare you?!
Shampoo.
- Actually, I'm about to close, but
cactus or castor oil?
By the way, you forgot to pay last time.
Put it on the bill. - No credit.
Then put it to memory.
- Castor oil, huh?
Look, redhead.
Cut the crap. I'll do anything.
But your hair is healthy?!
- I don't want to wait. I want you.
Ah, that stuff there.
I'm afraid
it's not for you. - I'll do anything.
What do you want? That I marry you?
I'll divorce and marry you.
What a bargain. For you.
Two successful firms: beauty parlour and
tango school with a turnover to make
you drool. You want to hang your hat,
welfare worker! - You don't know me.
I'll cover you with gold.
- Selling what? Your underwear?
Get serious!
Anyway sweetheart, by house tradition
I don't give it away for money but for love.
Ah yeah, huh?
That jerk from the bank?
He proved his love because I didn't put out.
He's been waiting 6 months.
And that night? - Just a goodnight kiss.
As if I believe you.
Anyway, what's the story, huh?
I'm not myself.
You're like a mosquito in my head.
I only think of you. I'll pay any price.
Any price. Even political!
Once again?
Even political.
Oh well, that's interesting.
- So that's what you want from me?
What I hold most sacred.
My lifelong faith. A true test.
Otherwise what kind of test is it?
Here. I the undersigned so-and-so
ask to join the political movement
known as the Northern League.
You're such a whore!
Nobody's forcing you.
If you want to think it over
I've got a roast and beans upstairs.
It already smells very delicious.
They haven't seen
Tunin at the party cell. I'll try the bar.
Forget them,
it's useless. Anyway it's obvious.
It galls them to be waiters.
Work turns their stomachs.
They like neither serving nor commanding.
They only like to break balls
Tough guy!
And voilÃ©!
What a sight!
So you waited
until after dinner to open hostilities?
What is this now? Fatal Attraction?
Pure political struggle,
my dear Po-River Trotsky!
Another drop?
Where were we?
Your first love.
- I was 16 when this Moroccan showed up.
<i>Moroccan?
-Yeah, weâ€œ, a Cambrian. Love - passion</i>
He got his kicks and
left me pregnant. And ran off to
Switzerland. A Comrade. - A Comrade?
A real Comrade! - Ah, I get it.
That's why you became a racist Federalist.

Eliminated the fruit of guilt
and luckily started working.
And you wound up a Leghista.
Good for you. - Good for you,
Bravo to you communists.
The Berlin Wall collapses. - You know what?
I don't even believe
that it collapsed. - You're ridiculous!
Communism failed. It died.
- And so did all the poor.
Yes, and that's why you're so
concerned. That's why you make Ferraris.
The perfect item for the poor.
So what?
That's a contradiction of the system.
No, you're anachronistic.
Anyway this here is not just a trial
of love, but a test of intelligence.
Stop it. I'm getting angry.
What for? Besides,
you're so cute when you're angry.
Alright, you ate, you drank
and you had time to think things over.
Your eyes are
forest green. I thought they were brown.
Is that so?
Well, I thought yours were mousegrey.
But instead
they're blacker
than hell.
Come here,
come here. You're too beautiful!
No, I'm not going to bed with a dimwit.
Alright, you win!
Yes! Come here!
Stop! First I want to know
something. - What?
About love. - Generally?
No, particularly. How many times
you made love with your wife.
What can I tell you honey?
Come on, we've been married 20 years.
And before?
- Nothing. Virgin.
Virgin. Alright, to start with
let's do some calculations.
Let's say first three years every night.
- You're joking!
At least,
subtract her days, her period.
That's easy, 4 days multiplied 12, 48
multiplied 3 equals 144.
1095 minus 144.
Did you study accounting? - Yes, I'm not
very smart, but I'm a whiz at arithmetic.
But I'm a whiz at arithmetic.
951! - Are you kidding?
You have to subtract all the fights,
pregnancies, trips, sickness.
Then the sexual crisis. After that
declines vertically towards once a week.
And the last ten years
not more than once a month.
There, that's the precise figure.
More than a thousand times.
More than a thousand times?
I can't stand it! You made love
1100 times with another woman.
Silly! Come here.
Stop this retroactive jealousy.
Now we make love.
- No, you're doing it with your wife.
No, I swear.
Come here. You're too beautiful!
Why always on the computer?
- Like the first time.
It's so romantic.
What a fandango, muchacho.
How can you be
so stupid and excite me more and more?
I haven't had a fandango like that
since the invasion of Czechoslovakia.
- Czechoslovakia? - That's right.
Too bad, you're such a dummy.
You didn't realise how much I liked you.
So your signature wasn't really necessary.
O well, maybe I did realise. But you were
keen on bringing my name to your Senator.
Oh, I'm sure he'll appreciate it.
- He'll appreciate it, huh?
Oh yes, it's a
great pleasure to deliver him
a nice hard-liner on a silver platter.
One with forest eyes.
Karl Marx?!
You signed Karl Marx!
He's even more important than me, right?
You pig, you dirty, low-down coward!
You dirty pig! Go away!
It was only a joke, cut it out!
- Are you nuts? You want to break my ass?
Are you crazy? - Fuck off!
Get away! Don't come here anymore!
Wait! Wait!
At least give me my pants.
Zvanin!
Oh my god!
Damned. Closed.
Zvanin! Zvanin!
What's going on?
- Oh no, now I woke Mariolina up.
Who is it? - It's me, Tunin.
Could you please go and get Zvanin?
- Are you serious? You know what time it is?
Why are you hiding?
- Please be so kind and get him for me.
Pretty please! Call him, wake him up!
It's important! Urgent! Political!
Political?!
Zvvanin wake up!
Tunin has something political for you.
Holy hell! The bed is empty.
That stinks. - Oh god.
Go to hell. What happened?
Weren't you two together?
- Yes, we were.
What's wrong with you?
- I didn't want to frighten you.
We were attacked by the Leghisti. - Really?
Ten or twelve, at least. They
caught me and chucked me into the river
And they stole my clothes.
But I stole their flag, see?
Yes, I see.
- Zvanin instead managed to escape.
That's why I thought
he was home. Now I'm worried.
Well, I'm not. I've had
enough of you two and your bullshit!
Who are you trying to fool?
Zvanin, Zvanin, stop!
What's wrong? - A catastrophe.
I wanted a pair of pants from you,
So Mariolina noticed that you weren't home.
I was looking for you everywhere.
So I came here.
Oh hell! Now you screwed me, too.
I've been waiting an hour to tell you our alibi.
We were attacked
by the Leghisti down by the river.
You have to insist on it. - She'll never
believe it. How the hell could she?
She'll believe, she'll believe.
Trust me. - What happened to you?
How come, you're like that?
I tore her apart. Mashed her.
What a night! What a woman!
She turned you into a flag boy.
- No, then we had a fight. I'll tell you later.
Never mind, just lend me your pants.
Are you nuts?!
- I can't go home like this.
You're nuts. She's gonna kill me!
What's her mood? - She's gonna kill you.
She's gonna kill me.
Throw down some pants for me, will you?!
She'll kill me.
Don't tell me anything about the Leghista,
otherwise I'll through you into the river.

What's all that?
What are you wearing? - The party symbol.
You bet she liked it!
She even kept my pants.
Interesting.
They're like a fetish for her.
What?!
- She wants to sleep with them.
She lies on top
of them and engages in the sexual act.
Get outta here!
It's called fetishism.
Tunin! Tunin!
We've made it.
- The redhead? - Yes.
She's expecting you at
three o'clock at her uncle's yacht. - Great!
How did you know?
- If I know about it I can make sure that
you go there.
Don't you ever read ma mail again!
Is that clear? - Yes.
Your yacht?
Nice, huh?
- Terrific.
Come on, things are different now.
How do like the Senator? Did you
like his political turnaround?
Or didn't you? - Sure. I understand.
Wonderful. Talk about trust.
But of course. You're fond of turncoats
betrayals and treachery.
Like all whores. - Always the gentleman.
Come and get your rags, Karl Marx.
I'm sorry I lost
my temper that night about Karl Marx.
I should've laughed. Instead I was a fool.
So you won. You scratched your itch.
Itch, huh? You made me
run through the streets naked.
You keep me on hold.
Then you whistle and I come running.
Are you a witch? What did you do to me?
Put a hex on me?
Me put a hex on you?!
You're the one who put a hex on me!
Come on, forest eyes,
let's make our own political turnaround!
A surprise no less from a friend.
Sure. From a friend.
A surprise coming from the river.
NOOO!
Get off!
- Signora Palmina? The poor wife of
this pig here?
Don't worry. I'll bring him home to you.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
It's just a political matter.
Palmina! Palmina!
Go run after your wife! Oh Tunin, Tunin!
No, you don't!
Not the tablecloth! We're setting up.
Turn around
and don't look! It's scandalous.
His ass hanging out! The man
who wears the pants! Who provides!
Provides shit! Not even money! Nothing!
Why the suitcase?
What does it mean?
Why this suitcase? Palmina!
It was the first
time after years. Oh, come on.
Don't be like that. Palmina!
I know you're there. You can hear me.
Palmina, open up and let's talk it over.
It's not like you think. It was
Believe me.
lt was an act of retaliation.
It was like getting even an affront.
You know, I'm not
a Romeo! We've been together 20 years.
You know the old rat loves you.
Careful, I won't come back.
Palmina, come on.
You're such an intelligent woman.
Alright then.
Send me to hell, okay?!
You remember that's how
we always made peace. it was nothing.
It was just a one time shot.
Sure.
A one time shot. No big deal.
Right. Nothing.
It didn't mean a thing, right?
Not a thing.
- Good, so now I can finally confess
I really need
to clear my conscience after 20 years.
20 years? What do you mean?
20 years just like Tazio.
Tazio? What does
Tazio have to do with it? - Plenty.
Because Tazio's not your boy.
Not your son. A one time shot.
You're joking. You're joking, right?
No, not with a face like that!
Who's the father?
- What difference does it make?
Tell me!
- You're a little short of memory.
You should know.
Or have you forgotten those days?
Don't you remember my first boyfriend?
Zvanin, the bastard!
Yes, good,
now go and ruin that family, too!
Mariola lives for
her husband. So make a scene!
Then maybe
she'll shoot us and hang herself!
Tunin! Tunin!
Tunin! What's going on?
What the hell...?
What the hell did I do to you?!
Have you gone completely gaga now?
The son of a bitch!
I want
a son from you. Now! A real son!
That was really rotten of you.
I mean the anonymous letter.
Now where're even.
That'll teach you to behave.
Anyway, don't you like my bed?
What is this crazy love?
Kisses and kicks in the ass.
Let's hope your wife doesn't suffer. - Why?
She has to suffer.
If she suffers, it's so much better.
How long does it
take to calculate your cycle stuff?
Do you really care for me?
- Hell, I'm making a baby!
Now listen up.
Let's drop the mask. I'm using a spiral.
What? And our son?
- Look, I can't have a baby right now.
Because I'm running
in the municipal elections.
You're a candidate? - Yes, Sir!
And I'll be appointed councilor.
Isn't Pivetti Speaker of the House?
Wait. You, Giacometti Rossella
want to become Chief of State?
What's gotten into you woman?!
What's the matter tonight, forest eyes?
Why do you
want a son? You already have one.
What's the matter?
Jesus Christ!
Holy cow, don't tell me It's not yours?!
It's not yours.
I'm sorry. If your wife's a whore
why should I have to pay for it?
Don't you dare call my wife a whore!
If you say a word
about my son, I swear I'll kill you!
I don't understand, Comrade. What exactly
are you requesting? - To be a candidate.
Department of Tourism and Culture.
- You, culture?!
Yes, culture. - When I hear
the word "culture", I reach for my gun.
What? - The Nazis said that. - The Nazis?
Are you sure? - I don't know. I think so.
I want the Leghisti out!
Are you crazy?
We beat the Right with them.
We ousted the government.
Presently, we're - I know. Asshole buddies.
And we're the Communist hard-liners?
At best we can join the Cub Scouts.
The moderate wing. - Silence, Comrade!
You're jabbering. You're not well.
Your nerves are shot.
Look at you. Drinking, babbling
behaving scandalously.
Even roaming the streets stark naked!
Look, believe me. It's best
you make yourself scarce around here.
You're expelling me? Great!
I lost my job,
my wife, my lover. And now my party!
I might be a jerk.
But you'll have a hairdresser a councilor!
Just leave me alone!
I'll lock myself in and forget about you all!
And now Councilor Giacmetti
sponsor of the Spring Rally.
This magnificent assembly
does honour to our new nation: Padania!
It is a nice symbol.
Even tourism, sport and
culture profit from an event like this.
What are you
saying, you dirty whore? Councilor!
The first
Spring Rally is dedicated to antique cars.
There she is again!
- Imagine how papa is feeling!
Come here.
Bring him his unemployment check tell him...
that our business is booming
and we don't need his money.
I heard he's living
like a bum. Tell him to straighten up.
For his own dignity.
- If he listens, Mama.
The last time he wouldn't even
let me in. Why does he hate me?
It's not you. He hates the world.
Bring him that stew.
You know him. He drinks but forgets to eat.
I proudly hand the microphone to
our Archbishop. - Proud, yeah!
For the blessing of the cars and
the drivers - You think, you can
do anything, don't you?
Keep your hands off
What's that?
Oh, not again!
Be good, will you?!
You filthy traitor!
Who is that bitch?
I'll kill that no-good!
She kissed him!
Come on, boys will be boys.
They love them
and leave them. Sure, they have to pay.
Pay dearly. Maybe too dearly.
- We've always loved each other. Always.
Except when you
punch him out every day.
Mama, I thought
it meant, that you love him very much?
Did you watch TV?
- No. - Come on. Get started.
The race is about
to start. Come on, there's still some time.
I said no.
What a dope! I organized it for you.
I don't care.
- Liar. You're eating your heart out.
You hear?
Forgive her, Tazio.
As Director of the Bank of Mantua,
I'm proud to take part in the race
I'll win the race.
My car works fine and I'm well prepared.
Go fuck yourself, whoever you are!
It's me, Papa. Tazio.
Sorry. But go away!
I don't want to see anybody.
I have your paycheque.
- Give it to Mama.
She says it's yours.
Come on, papa!
She made some stew for you.
Stew after Nutella. Well
After Nutella, sure why not? Who cares?
It's still hot.
- Did she make it with potatoes?
Yes. - Probably too much pepper,
as usual. Look at him, would you?
You see him?
With all
the Leghisti sponsors, putting on airs.
Strutting like a peacock. Look at him!
Likely he'll lose
and come off like a jerk. What a goon!
A professional goon, certified first class.
Cut it out, papa.
Don't talk like that about Uncle Zvanin!
Why shouldn't
I call that asshole an asshole? He is one.
Because he's Volga's Papa! And
me and Volga are getting married.
You want to marry Volga? - Yes.
You want to marry her? - Yes!
No way!
- Why not? We were all agreed.
Now just because you and Uncle
Zvanin fought - That's not the reason!
Yes it is! You're calling him a goon!
All right, then tell me why!
Papa! Papa! Tell me why, Papa!
Enough of your "Papas!"
- Where are you going?
Wait, wait! Another contestant!
Is he valid? Of course!
He's listed as Mr. X. Come on.
Stop your son! Before he
marries your daughter!
My son? What son?
Palmina told me
everything. - Everything what?
Tazio's not my son. He's your son!
- What the fuck are you saying?
Stop him before he makes incest
with your daughter. If he hasn't already!
What the holy fuck are you saying?!
Me and Palmina never did it.
She always held out.
Then I went to Germany after you stole her.
You jerk, you're the one who told me
that she was still a virgin! - Virgin?
What are you saying?
- What am I saying? Virgin?
She knows that
Tazio and Volga are in love, shithead.
She would never
let them commit incest, you jerk!
Shit. I think you're right.
I think you're right.
Yeah, she was a virgin.
What a jerk! What a jerk I am!
Look, everybody's passing us!
Oh hell, now that you totalled my car.
All right,
hop into mine. We'll bust some ass!
I'm proud to kiss the winner!
The golden Alberto da Cuissano.
This victory is
dedicated to Marx, Lenin and Nuvolari!
I don't give a shit
if the Berlin Wall collapsed.
I'm still standing.
Long live Stalin. And long live Lenin!
- Long live Marx! - And Togliatti!
And long live Nuvolari!
Did you go to bed with her?
- Do I have to make a speech?
Tell me the truth! Yes or no!
- It wasn't a bed. A PC.
A PC? - A Personal Computer.
Olivetti. In leasing, but comfortable.
You came back, you old tomcat.
Look what a mess
you are. Yeah, sure, of course.
You spend the night
chasing some stray kitten
with silky fur.
Who meows and purrs for you.
When you need your warm milk you come
back. You old mischief-maker.
That's enough now.
Look what I have
here for you. Some mail.
We've been rehired!
Next Sunday we'll go
and dance tango.
Just me and you. - Hey Zvanin!
We've been
rehired. We go back to work!
Starting when? - Monday.
And our free time?
- Come on, let's make a toast!
Here's to "free time!"
Election night, April 21, 1996
The results of the election will certainly
generate a great deal of discussion.
Ulivio has won. The exact
amount of seats will be announced later.
Look at this!
I've been waiting
50 years to celebrate in a square
full of red flags.
And now the flags are green.
The Leghisti are coming here.
"New Nation! - Romans Thieves!"
We don't like your ltalia.
We want a free Padania!
Freedom for our nation has come.
We want to part Milano from Rome.
Freedom for our nation has come.
We let the thieves run to Rome.
Do they want to provoke us?
- They are provoking us.
Padania, cast out the Southerners!
- Shitty Leghisti!
Long live our new nation.
Get away thieves, we're coming on strong.
The unity of Italy is sacred.
- Yes, yes. Long live Italy!
Long live Mazzini! Viva Cavour!
And Victor Emmanuel ll !
Long live united Italy!
Trento, Trieste, Catania, Caltanisetta!
O sole mio...
Leave me alone!
- Hands off her tits! Hands off!!
Holy shit. Not again?!
