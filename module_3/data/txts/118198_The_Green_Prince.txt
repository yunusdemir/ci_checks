Gonen <i>Ben Yitzhak:
Rabin was murdered.</i>
<i>I was shocked
like even/body else.</i>
<i>I felt that I need
to do something for my countW.</i>
<i>When I joined the Shin Bet,</i>
<i>my father told me, "Listen,
this is</i> a <i>dam organization.</i>
<i>Don't do it. Don't go there."</i>
Mosab Hassan Yousef:
The goal was to <i>kill</i> Israelis.
<i>We had the right
to make the other side</i>
<i>feel our pain.</i>
<i>I thought this is
my chance to be</i> a <i>hero,</i>
a <i>mujahid, fight for
the sake of the nation.</i>
<i>But Allah had
other plans for me.</i>
Gonen:
Recruiting is an an',
<i>a veq/ difficult an'.</i>
<i>The main issue
is to understand</i>
<i>who is the person that's
sitting in front of you.</i>
<i>You need to understand
his point of view,</i>
<i>you need to understand
his background.</i>
<i>Who is his family?</i>
<i>What happened with him?</i>
<i>You tn/ to find their needs.</i>
<i>And then when you know that,</i>
<i>you know how to play with him.</i>
<i>When you handle</i> a <i>source,</i>
<i>you make him do things
that he would never do.</i>
<i>To your benefit,
it's not yours,</i>
<i>it's the government's benefit.</i>
<i>And you do it
by finding his weak points,</i>
<i>and use them.</i>
<i>The first time I heard
about The Green Prince</i>
<i>was when I was in training.</i>
<i>It was big secret,</i>
<i>but we've been told that
there is</i> a <i>new recruit.</i>
<i>His nickname
was The Green Prince.</i>
<i>He was considered
highly, highly dangerous.</i>
The first day, handling him,
was the first day
ofthe end of my career.
Mosab:
To collaborate with Israel
is the most shameful thing
you can do in my country.
If somebody raped his mother,
that's very shameful,
but if he collaborated
with Israel,
this is much more shameful.
<i>( Helicopter whirring )</i>
(distant car horns honking )
Mosab: <i>My father dedicated
his entire life</i>
<i>for the cause of Islam,</i>
<i>thinking that the Islamic
philosophy and ideology</i>
<i>will solve
the problem of humanity.</i>
I came to understand
the importance of my father
from day one.
<i>People used to travel</i>
<i>from eveq/ pan' of the countn/</i>
<i>to hear his Friday speech</i>
at Ramallah Mosque.
<i>See this person,</i>
<i>with this status</i>
<i>that is serving people,</i>
<i>living</i> a <i>humble life.</i>
<i>Helping the</i> poor.
<i>Not taking advantage
of his position.</i>
That taught me a lot.
<i>( Man chanting call to prayer)</i>
<i>I was always
veW, veq/ proud of him.</i>
<i>I saw him
as my highest example.</i>
If there was a god
that I could see at that time,
and a higher authority
in my life, it was my dad.
(crowd cheering and whistling )
<i>( Hassan Yousef announcing
in Arabic over loudspeaker )</i>
<i>( crowd repeats back)</i>
<i>( crowd cheering )</i>
Mosab: <i>My</i> father wanted
to take me with him
even/where he goes.
<i>He thought that this is
how he's going to build</i>
<i>a future version of him.</i>
<i>As the oldest of five brothers</i>
<i>and three sisters,</i>
many times I changed
their diapers,
I cooked for them,
I took care ofthem,
babysit them
when my mom was gone
and my fatherwas in prison.
L remember actually
at least two of them,
<i>the youngest
used to call me Papa.</i>
<i>And we established</i>
a <i>strong relationship</i>
among us, which...
it was impossible,
impossible to break.
That kind of bond
is impossible to break.
<i>Hamas was not
just</i> a <i>movement to us,</i>
<i>it was the family's business.</i>
It was our identity.
It was everything.
You know, my father is
sacrificing and dedicating
his life for that cause.
( Crowd chanting prayer
in response to man's call )
<i>He spent close to 16 years</i>
<i>in Israeli prisons, maybe more.</i>
<i>My father was among us.</i>
He was having dinner.
<i>- ( Knocking on door )
- Somebody knocked the door.</i>
<i>They came,</i>
they took him from among us,
and they promised
to bring him back
five minutes later.
(soldiers shouting )
I went outside.
I waited for hours
and they did not bring him back.
He came back
a year and a half later.
<i>He came home in the afternoon</i>
<i>and was arrested again</i>
<i>six hours later.</i>
I hated the Israeli soldiers
and anybody who's
put in an Israeli uniform
because of that event.
<i>My father did not
teach me how to hate,</i>
<i>but I was 17 and I didn't know
how not to feel that way.</i>
<i>My cousin Ibrahim
always mentioned</i>
<i>that he had access
to people with guns,</i>
and when I decided to buy guns,
I asked for his help.
<i>In the middle of the mountain,</i>
they had the guns
somewhere in a bag.
They spray black pepper on them
in case there was any dogs
on the checkpoint.
<i>I put the guns
in the doors of the car.</i>
<i>( police siren blares )</i>
<i>On our way back,
there was</i> a <i>checkpoint,</i>
<i>and we were stopped.</i>
And they checked our IDs
and they searched
the trunk of the car.
<i>It was</i> a <i>veq/ scaq/</i>
and dangerous moment for me,
as a teenager still.
<i>Finally, we made it
all the way to Ramallah</i>
<i>through all the checkpoints.</i>
<i>I had one thing in mind,</i>
that is revenge.
<i>( Indistinct radio chatter )</i>
Gonen: <i>Because he was the son
of Hassan Yousef,</i>
<i>Mosab was under surveillance
of the Shin Bet.</i>
<i>He was</i> a <i>veq/ imporfant
target for us for two reasons.</i>
<i>One, to make sure that
he doesn't do anything wrong,</i>
and second, because we wanted
to recruit people like him.
Mosab:
When <i>I</i> came to visit my mom,
<i>she told me the Israeli forces</i>
<i>came to our house.</i>
<i>She said,
'Did you do anything wrong?"</i>
I told her I did nothing.
Of course, I could not
share with herwhat I did.
<i>( Israeli soldiers speaking
Hebrew over radio )</i>
<i>After! left the house,</i>
<i>I see Special Forces</i>
<i>coming out of the bushes,</i>
pointing the guns
right to my face.
<i>They pulled me out,</i>
<i>and when I resisted,</i>
Is starfed
to receive hits from even/body.
<i>The second minute
we stan' driving,</i>
<i>I receive this strong hit
with the back of</i> a <i>rifle...</i>
<i>- ( strikes blow with rifle )
- ...directly to my head.</i>
<i>( siren blares faintly )</i>
<i>( gate clangs )</i>
<i>I hear people screaming.</i>
<i>I hear people in pain.</i>
<i>I hear veW, veq/ loud music.</i>
<i>( gate clangs )</i>
<i>You just get panic attack
to walk there.</i>
<i>This is how scaq/ it was.</i>
Gonen: <i>Mosab was 17 years old
when he was arrested.</i>
<i>And this was his first arrest.</i>
He'd never
been in an interrogation,
and not to know what's going on
is worse than anything.
<i>The fear must be tremendous.</i>
<i>Thinking, "What's going on?"</i>
<i>"What am I going to say?"</i>
<i>"Am I going to lie? "</i>
<i>"Are they going to beat me?"</i>
"What is torture?"
M <i>osa</i> b :
<i>An officer came inside.</i>
He asked me, "Who gave you
the order to buy the guns'?
Who gave you the guns?"
<i>I tried not to show
that I was afraid,</i>
but deep in my heart
I was really terrified.
He had a "yellow smile"
on his face
that told me that "We know."
And he said,
"Your fatherwas here,
and he was a tough guy.
Are you a tough guy'?
Do you wanna be tough
or do you wanna talk?"
And I was like,
"l have nothing to talk about."
And he started to laugh.
He told me, "Mosab..."
(speaking Arabic)
<i>"Welcome
to the slaughterhouse."</i>
Mosab: <i>At the beginning,
there was no sleeping,</i>
<i>not at night,
not during the day.</i>
<i>You 're sitting
24 hours forever.</i>
This is like the feeling,
that notion that you had,
that this is not gonna end.
<i>Half of my body was numb,</i>
and the other half was
in tremendous amount of pain,
night after night after night.
<i>You stan' to lose</i>
<i>your sense of reality.</i>
I start
to forget howl look like.
I could not think very well.
I am missing my mother a lot,
I'm thinkin' about her,
you know, how she's
handling the situation.
Usually, when
my father is arrested,
<i>I am outside,
side by side with her,</i>
helping her
with the responsibilities,
and everything,
sharing with her,
and now here I am,
for the first time,
in a place that I hoped
that she does not
even think that I was there.
( Man shouts )
Gonen: <i>I would</i> look
at their psychological set
<i>and tn/ find their weak points,</i>
their needs.
Maybe because I had
the degree in psychology,
it helped me a little bit.
Many times I felt,
when I tried to recruit someone,
I had a feeling
when I'm going to recruit him.
Mosab: <i>After</i> a few weeks,
<i>they brought me to the level,
to break me down.</i>
Officer came and sat down,
and he asked me,
"Why do you get yourself
in trouble like this'?
You're still very young.
If you did something,
just why didn't you
tell those guys'?
And you're trying
to play the tough guy'?
You know, that's
not gonna work for you.
That's just
gonna make it worse."
He told me
those guys had believed
that you did something big,
and if you didn't
tell them the truth,
they're gonna continue
till they extract
that information from you.
I told him,
"Listen, I bought guns,
but we never used the guns.
We are not connected
to any military cell.
I am sure that father
is very disappointed.
I promise you.
I'm not lying to you."
He kinda believed what I said.
I had a killer instinct.
I knew it, you know.
I was so into it.
I knewthat
it's going to happen.
He asked me,
"Would you work for us?"
And I thought, "ls this guy
like out of his mind, orwhat?"
How can he convince
someone like me
now to work for Israel'?
Simply, because of my father,
I will never betray my father.
Gonen: <i>He knows
that when he says "Yes",</i>
<i>maybe things
will be more smooth,</i>
more GSSY.
<i>He was afraid.</i>
I thought, what about
if I tell them "Yes"?
This way,
I can get out of prison.
<i>So I told them "Yes."</i>
<i>They said,
"If</i> we <i>release you,</i>
<i>even/body is going to question</i>
how come we released you,
and you will be exposed
and possibly killed.
You <i>have</i> to go
to the Megiddo Prison.
There you just
take care, and get to know
all the Hamas leaders in prison,
and when you get out of prison,
we will meet again,
and we talk."
Who rules and who governs
what happens inside the prison
<i>is not the Israeli government,
it's not the Shin Bet,</i>
<i>it's not the Israeli police.</i>
<i>They are organized by sections.</i>
<i>So when Mosab comes,</i>
<i>he gets to the Hamas section.</i>
<i>There, they have
their own security force.</i>
<i>When prisoners come from
Shin Bet interrogations,</i>
<i>they ask</i>
a <i>veq/ tricky question.</i>
"Were you asked
to work for Israel
during your interrogation?"
If they say "No,"
that's it, they are marked,
as a potential Israeli source.
Why'? Because
they knowthat, usually,
we don't miss the opportunity
to try and recruit someone
during their interrogation.
Mosab:
<i>I</i> came to the Hamas people.
L told them,
"The Israeli Intelligence
offered me to work for them,
and I said yes,
and my plan is to take revenge.
<i>If I had an opporfunity</i>
<i>to kill my handler,</i>
<i>to kill any Israeli,</i>
<i>I wouldn't hesitate</i> a <i>second."</i>
They said, "ls that it?"
And I said, "This is it."
Said, "What's your network'?
Did they connect you with
somebody inside the prison?"
And lwas like, "No, they did
not connect me with anybody."
They come back
with the same question,
"What's your network?" I said,
"No, there is no network."
<i>"What is the plan?</i>
<i>You just told them,
'Oka y, I wom with you,'</i>
and they did not
give you any mission?"
I said, "No."
I told them the truth,
and the truth
did not make any sense to them.
Yes, he is the son
of Hassan Yousef,
and they honor
Hassan Yousef.
But then, he is alone in prison,
and things can happen.
His uncle was there.
<i>Actually, his uncle
was torfuring people</i>
that agreed to work for Israel
when they arrived to prison,
because inside prison,
they don't want anybody
to spy on them.
<i>And he is afraid.</i>
Mosab: <i>I remember
one of the times,</i>
<i>the Hamas security guys
would come and say,</i>
'Even/body evacuate this tent."
Now, we leave our stuff,
we leave whatever we are doing,
they close the tent,
nobody can see what's going on,
and they turn on
all the TVs
of the section very loud
and they ask some of
the guys to start singing,
<i>so the soldiers outside</i>
<i>don't hear
the prisoners screaming.</i>
<i>Now, the prisoner was screaming
like crazy inside,</i>
<i>and we did not know
what was happening with him.</i>
People that we just get to know,
after a couple days,
"Where are they'?
Why don't we see them anymore?"
They're gone.
They'rejust held in that corner
being tortured,
their body is being burned...
the Hamas guys put needles
under their fingernails,
burned plastic on their bodies.
<i>( Men shouting in distance )</i>
<i>There was no limit.</i>
<i>Sometimes without evidence,</i>
they tortured people to death.
We're talking about
not one prisoner or two,
we're talking about hundreds.
<i>I was looking at that picture,
and I was thinking,</i>
<i>"This is my father's project."</i>
When we sit at home
like a family,
and my father
used to share with us
about his goals.
He would say,
"l work for Allah.
There is a chance to get killed
anytime soon, for this project."
That's my father, telling me
that he could get killed
for the sake of Hamas
and please to accept,
he was saying
please to understand,
"lf anything happens to me,
take care of each other.
Take care of your mom."
And I had to hear that
again and again and again.
I had to witness
the Israeli soldiers
pulling him from among us,
and taking him, humiliating him,
and putting him in prison
for a long time.
Forwhat'? For the sake of Hamas.
Now here I am in prison,
and I see Hamas.
And that was
really shocking.
<i>Mosab:
My father wanted from us</i>
<i>to be connected always
to the land,</i>
<i>and olive trees,</i>
<i>since olive trees
are veq/ imporfant</i>
<i>in the Palestinian culture.</i>
<i>At the age of five,</i>
<i>he asked me
to go with our neighbors</i>
<i>to see
how people harvest olives</i>
<i>and take care of their land.</i>
I remembervery well
<i>the atmosphere
was really amazing.</i>
<i>And the family that
my father trusted with</i>
<i>asked their son</i>
<i>to take me home
before the dam.</i>
<i>On the way home,</i>
this guy started
to act in a weird way,
you know, trying to touch me.
And they knewthat
he had the evil desires.
<i>I ran for my life.</i>
I ran to protect myself.
He was much bigger.
He was much stronger.
And I could not resist anymore.
What happened was
absolutely brutal and dark.
When I got back home,
you know, my mom was waiting,
and I could not tell her
a word about what happened.
For some reason, I was ashamed.
<i>( Man calling
for prayer in distance )</i>
<i>I never shared that
with anybody,</i>
<i>because if that news came out,</i>
I would have
a problem at school,
I would have a problem
in the future,
and lwould be isolated,
<i>because in my society,</i>
the more painful thing
than being raped
is to have the reputation
of being raped.
It's very hard to face
this monster called shame.
<i>After! was released
from prison,</i>
<i>I was still under huge shock.</i>
<i>At that time, my father
was in Israeli prison.</i>
Most of my friends at school,
they were already
in their first and second year
at university,
and I was not graduated.
<i>I was on my own,</i>
<i>and I did not know
who to trust anymore.</i>
<i>(people chattering )</i>
<i>So now I don't think
about revenge anymore,</i>
<i>'cause I don't know
what I'm fighting for.</i>
<i>Couple of weeks
after! was released,</i>
<i>I received</i> a <i>phone call</i>
<i>from same person
who recruited me.</i>
He told me, "Listen, I know
that you have many questions.
We cannot talk over the phone.
<i>I would like if can have</i>
a <i>cup of coffee</i>
<i>and discuss these things."</i>
I was curious.
I wanted to know
what was going on.
<i>( Indistinct radio chatter )</i>
<i>Gonen:
It crossed my mind that</i>
<i>when I bring someone
to the meeting,</i>
<i>basically,
I'm destroying his life.</i>
But what was important is
to bring this guy.
<i>So recruit the son
of Sheikh Hassan Yousef</i>
<i>was</i> a <i>veW,
veq/ imporfant issue.</i>
<i>At the beginning,</i>
<i>it was</i> a <i>secret,
even inside the Shin Bet.</i>
<i>Even the guards that
brought him to the meeting</i>
<i>didn't know who he was.</i>
Mosab: <i>I</i> did not know
<i>how far the Agency
is going to take</i>
<i>the promise that I gave them.</i>
<i>I was afraid that
if he said "Yes,"</i>
<i>maybe this is
on</i> a <i>camera somewhere.</i>
<i>They could expose
that thing to public,</i>
<i>to embarrass my family.</i>
"Your son give his word
to work for the enemies."
This is somehow shameful.
<i>Gonen:
When you bring the source</i>
<i>to the first meeting,
he's not with you.</i>
<i>You need to bring</i>
a <i>Palestinian guy</i>
and make him betray
his own people.
<i>For most Palestinians,</i>
<i>Shit Bet handler
is the devil himself.</i>
And he expects that the devil
will react like a devil.
Mosab:
<i>I found myself in</i> a <i>room</i>
<i>with closed windows.</i>
<i>Going into the room,</i>
I asked him, "Why didn't you
rescue your people'?
Why'? The people who worked
for you were tortured,
they were in pain,
and nobody did anything
to come rescue them."
He said, "And who told you
that those people
were working for us
from the first place?"
I told him,
"What do you mean?"
He said, "Those guys have
no relationship with us at all."
He said, "How Hamas
got to knowthose people'?
<i>Bring in somebody
and ask him about</i> a <i>netwom? "</i>
I said, "Yes."
"Let me ask you this question.
What is your network?"
I told him,
"l have no network.
You did not
connect me with anybody."
He said, "Who told you that
we connect people with anybody'?
That's not
how intelligence work.
You are responsible
for yourself,
and you only know
about yourself.
No one else knows about you,
and you're supposed
not to know about anyone else
and that's it}.
And suddenly,
everything changes.
Nobody had a gun
in my head telling me,
"We're gonna shoot you
if your don't work for us."
Nobody came to me
with secret files
<i>and told me, "We 're gonna
send you to jail</i>
<i>or expose you. "</i>
It was against everything
that we learned
about the Israeli Intelligence.
Maybe the Shin Bet
did not realize
what was happening
in my mind at that point,
and they did not intend
to tell me anything
to change me mind.
<i>But for me,
I stan' to realize that</i>
we are living a lie.
And people are dying
because ofthis lie.
That's it.
I knowthat he's hooked.
And this is why I continued,
because I needed to answer
those questions
<i>for my soul.</i>
Gonen:
If you want a good source,
he needs to be with you,
not against you.
And you need to be with him,
and not against him.
<i>Mosab:
From the eany beginning,</i>
<i>the Israeli Intelligence
made it veq/ clear to me</i>
<i>that you have to finish
your high school</i>
<i>that you did not finish.</i>
Honor your parents.
Take care
of your brothers and sisters.
Take care of your school.
Actually, they were
just like my father.
When he gets an education,
he meets people.
<i>He becomes more imporfant
in his community.</i>
He becomes
more important for me.
<i>Mosab: I was saying,</i>
"How <i>can I guarantee
that you just don't use me</i>
and one day, either kill me,
or send somebody to kill me,
or maybe I get killed
because of this.
It's like, why would
I continue with you guys?"
He told me, "Listen, how old
is your grandfather's
Roman olive trees?"
I told him, "Some ofthese trees
are hundreds of years old."
<i>"To us,
you are like olive tree.</i>
Of course, we need to water you,
we need to build you up.
We need to give you
enough support
to be able
at some point to give fruit."
Gonen:
You also give him
the notion that
he's important for you,
and you're notjust using him.
<i>In Mosab's case,</i>
<i>it help us to use him.</i>
<i>( Indistinct radio chatter )</i>
For the Shin Bet,
it was like, you know,
a real achievement
in the war against Hamas.
It's like recruiting the son
ofthe Israeli Prime Minister.
This is the way we looked at it.
<i>( Indistinct radio chatter )</i>
Gonen:
<i>For me as</i> a <i>handler,</i>
my sources are
somehow like toys.
You know, this is a big game,
and I'm a player.
L play
in the intelligence field,
but it's a game.
We didn't know much
about Hamas at that time.
Recruiting someone
so close to Hamas,
and you know, Mosab was
not a Hamas member.
He was not a Hamas member.
He was his father's son.
So we needed to find a way
to make him
bring the information.
<i>Mosab: A few months after</i>
<i>I agreed
to wom for the Agency,</i>
<i>my father's release
from prison was arranged.</i>
<i>My</i> father needed someone
<i>to be his assistant,</i>
<i>and he could not find
better person</i>
<i>than his oldest son,
the closest to him,</i>
<i>that he can trust.</i>
(speaking Arabic)
Gonen: <i>Hassan Yousef was
always in the middle of things.</i>
<i>He got money,</i>
and he spread the money,
in order to let Hamas
do what they do.
Some of it was civil work,
and some of it wasn't.
<i>Now, people came
to meet Hassan Yousef.</i>
<i>They always met Mosab
before they met Hassan Yousef.</i>
He was the gatekeeper.
All of Hassan Yousef's
phone calls
we answered by Mosab.
Someone from <i>Gaza,</i>
someone from Nab/us,
<i>someone from Syria
called Hassan Yousef.</i>
<i>He will talk first with Mosab</i>
and then with Hassan Yousef.
If Mosab decides
that it's important enough,
<i>and when he decided it,</i>
<i>we decided it.</i>
Mosab: <i>My dad had
no clue what I was doing.</i>
<i>He wanted to take me with him
even/where he goes.</i>
Sometimes we would go
into an office
and we have, let's say,
a coffee table.
<i>We took picture
of that coffee table.</i>
<i>The arfists of the Agency</i>
<i>would create
the exact same table.</i>
And I gojust inside
and change tables,
so nowthe person
would come next day
and he wouldn't know
the difference
that we gave him
a brand new table
that was a table
that could listen.
<i>Gonen:
The people that take decisions</i>
<i>are not necessarily
the people you see on TV.</i>
Mosab helped us understand
and uncover part ofthis system.
The experience was amazing.
I got a chance to learn things
and to see things
that average person can't see.
Gonen: He loved it.
<i>He was addicted to the action.</i>
So for me
as a handler, I used it.
<i>You need to teach him</i>
<i>how to ask questions,</i>
how not to ask questions,
<i>otherwise, he will be
exposed after</i> a <i>week,</i>
and he will be dead,
or l will be dead
after two weeks.
Mosab: When <i>I</i> was asked
to go do something,
the first command I had was
don't act like Abu Arab,
or don't act like James Bond.
<i>The best wa y,
just to act like yourself.</i>
<i>When I was woming out</i> a <i>lot,</i>
<i>you know,
and I starfed to get buff,</i>
the Agency asked me
to reduce that a little,
because it was getting
lots of attention.
We tried hard to convince Mosab
to become Hamas member.
We told him to go to the mosque,
<i>to pray, to grow his beard.</i>
He wouldn't listen.
In the beginning,
it was really frustrating,
because you have a great source,
<i>you want to push him</i>
to go deeper
and deeper into Hamas.
He wouldn't do it.
He wouldn't do it.
<i>Mosab:
There were red lines that I had</i>
<i>that I could not cross.</i>
<i>It was not Hamas
moral code anymore.</i>
<i>It was not the Israeli
Intelligence moral code.</i>
It was my own moral code
that I developed for myself
within my limited
knowledge at that time.
Gonen: <i>We called him
"The Green Prince."</i>
<i>Fast, he understood this is</i>
<i>his secret name
in the Shin Bet,</i>
<i>and he acted as</i> a <i>prince.</i>
He wouldn't take anything
humiliating from anybody.
I realized my choices
that I'm making,
and I knew at some point,
the Agency could not force me
to continue working.
Information is power.
He brought the information.
He had the power in his hands,
and I think that he knew
from the beginning
what kind of tool
he has in his hands,
and he used it.
M osa b :
They needed someone <i>like</i> me.
<i>This is</i> a <i>big achievement.</i>
<i>And I knew,
like through his eyes,</i>
<i>I was the biggest recruitment
that he had so far.</i>
He needed <i>that,</i>
so <i>I</i> played the game.
<i>( Bells ringing in distance )</i>
<i>( man calling

Mosab: <i>Yasser Arafat
met with my father</i>
<i>to discuss the details</i>
ofthe Intifada
and its activities.
<i>He did not want to look like</i>
he's asking people
to come down to the streets.
He wanted
to stay away from that,
and have someone to do
the dirtyjob for him.
<i>I wanted my father
to be careful.</i>
<i>There was no way</i>
to talk to him directly
about anything.
<i>Gonen:
The Green Prince called us</i>
<i>and informed us that</i>
<i>Arafat was talking
to Hassan Yousef.</i>
And told him, "Be prepared.
We are going
to blow up everything."
<i>The Shin Bet in Israel</i>
<i>couldn 't handle
this information at that time.</i>
<i>Our hope was in Arafat.</i>
(speaking in Arabic)
Gonen: <i>During that time,
I was in charge of</i>
<i>all the operations
that happened in Ramallah.</i>
<i>It was</i> a <i>big,
big responsibility.</i>
<i>I hardly slept.</i>
I didn't know
how my wife coped with this.
I would come very late.
After a few days,
I wasn't at home,
<i>and all night,
I get all kind of phone calls.</i>
<i>They never come and tell you,</i>
<i>"You know,
now we are in FebruaW.</i>
Next December, someone
is going to make an attack."
No, you don't have
this privilege.
It's always like
in two hours, in one hour,
half an hour,
and you start to worry.
<i>( Oveflapping Hebrew
chatter over radio )</i>
<i>Gonen:
Even/ day we had new bombing.</i>
- <i>Sometimes, twice</i> a <i>day.</i>
- <i>( sirens blaring )</i>
<i>We would wake up
in the morning thinking,</i>
<i>"What's going to happen today?"</i>
<i>Mosab:
I realized that cowards</i>
<i>with the name of courage</i>
<i>are leading children and women,</i>
an entire nation to death.
<i>( Sirens blaring )</i>
Gonen: It was <i>like</i>
a flood that you can't stop.
<i>Ten, twenty Israelis
are killed because of you,</i>
because you didn't prevent
the killing.
Sometimes I felt I need
to take my gun
and go shoot people
in Ramallah.
It was nonsense.
It wasn't something
I would ever do,
but the level
of frustration was so high,
and the anger.
And I tried to remind myself,
you know, this is
what they are doing.
You can't go
and shoot innocent people.
And yet, I felt like
sometimes I need to do it.
I did not have a problem
of stopping a suicide bomber.
Actually, I did not have
a problem of cracking down
the entire Hamas security
and military wing at that time.
This is how much
I was frustrated.
<i>Because when things went
out of control,</i>
<i>there was still</i>
a <i>responsibility towards</i>
<i>eveq/ individual
of that society.</i>
People were afraid
<i>to stand
and say no to suicide bombs.</i>
(speaking Arabic)
<i>This is veq/ hard to tell
what was on his hean'.</i>
<i>You know, at least
in his public appearance,</i>
<i>he did suppon'
the suicide bombing.</i>
But on a personal level,
l'm not sure.
We got an order
from the government,
"You need to find
some terrorists
and assassinate them."
<i>( Hebrew chatter over radio )</i>
<i>Hassan Yousef was</i>
a <i>great target.</i>
I was afraid
that they were gonna come
to ask me something
that I cannot do.
And at that point,
I'm gonna say "no" to that.
<i>I wrote him</i> a <i>letter,
not handwritten,</i>
and I pretended
that I was someone else,
and I did not leave even
any clue that could lead to me.
"L want to tell you
that you are a target,
and you can get killed any time.
Stay away from Hamas activities,
especially its military wing.
And you need to go to a hide,
<i>and don't trust
your bodyguards. "</i>
The next day, he immediately
fired his bodyguards,
and he told me, "l want
to go into a safe house."
I told him, "Why?"
And he said,
"There is no specific reason,
but I feel that this is the time
to really go to a hide."
<i>When he gave me his secrets,</i>
<i>his locations, even/thing,</i>
and I gave all that information
to the Israeli Intelligence,
that was by all means,
in his world, was betrayal.
Now, in my world,
it was a different story.
In my world,
it was responsibility.
In my world,
it was saving his life.
In my world, it was saving
many other people's lives.
Gonen: <i>You can't
assassinate his father</i>
<i>and keep him as</i> a <i>source.</i>
<i>So the plan was to isolate him.</i>
Make the Green Prince,
Mosab, his son,
the only connection between
him and the outside world,
in order to get
to otherwanted people.
<i>Mosab had great connections
with the Hamas leadership</i>
<i>in Damascus, in Gaza,</i>
<i>of course, in the West Bank.</i>
When Hassan Yousef
sends information,
and sends his point of view
through The Green Prince
to others, and get a response.
E <i>veg/thing is monitored
by Shin Bet.</i>
<i>It was something veq/ unique.</i>
When he needs to give an answer
<i>to Khaled Meshaal,
the head of the Hamas movement,</i>
and we don't like the answer,
we can manipulate his answer.
In a way, we can create
a new reality.
<i>( Hebrew chatter over radio )</i>
Female reporter: All out war
between Israel and Hamas.
The Israeli military
launched another attack today.
It was the sixth one
in two weeks
targeting Hamas leaders
and their lieutenants.
<i>Helicopters and missiles doing
what Israel says</i>
<i>the Palestinian
Authority will not.</i>
<i>For its pan' though,
the Palestinian Authority says</i>
<i>the continuing missile attacks
make that job,</i>
<i>reining in militants,
even harder to do.</i>
Mosab: <i>At some point,
my father called me</i>
<i>and he said, 'Finally,
the PA agreed</i>
to release the members
of the movement. "
<i>Ibrahim Hamid,
Muhammad Jamal Nachher,</i>
<i>Saleh Talahme,
Said Sheikh Kasem.</i>
<i>Those guys were the spine
of the Hamas militan/ wing,</i>
<i>and all of them
were masterminds</i>
<i>behind many suicide
bombing attacks.</i>
<i>And it happened that I took
those people with my car</i>
<i>from the Palestinian
Authority prison</i>
<i>to the safe house.</i>
Gonen :
This <i>piece</i> of information
<i>you get once in</i> a <i>lifetime.</i>
<i>( Hebrew chatter over radio )</i>
<i>Now, using
this information means</i>
<i>you 're going to kill Mosab,</i>
<i>because they will check it,</i>
<i>they will understand fast that
Mosab gave that information,</i>
and the game is over.
We needed to make a choice.
<i>We had</i> a <i>chopper in the air.</i>
And I remember an argument,
a very emotional
argument at that time.
I remember the manager
of Special Operations
of Shin Bet screaming,
saying, you know, "Shoot!"
I felt that
I'm tempted to do it
because the mission
is so important.
You know, you are
so focused in what you do.
You put everything aside.
<i>( Man speaking in Hebrew)</i>
And we didn't do it.
<i>( Man speaking in Hebrew)</i>
Male reporter: The explosion
in the Israeli coastal town
<i>of Hadera, between Tel Aviv
and Haifa in norfhern Israel,</i>
<i>according to hospital
sources in the town,</i>
<i>two people have been killed,</i>
<i>as many as 25 people
have been injured.</i>
<i>Israel holds the Palestinian
Authority responsible</i>
<i>because the authority freed</i>
<i>Hamas and Islamic
Jihad activists.</i>
Gonen: <i>Iremember
when Mosab heard the news,</i>
he was really sad.
It struck me that he's so sad.
He was ashamed of what happened.
<i>It seemed like
he's disappointed</i>
<i>that he couldn't help
in this case.</i>
<i>It was obvious that
this is a Hamas attack.</i>
And this was maybe
the time I understood
that, you know,
he's notjust a source.
<i>He was there
for us all the time.</i>
<i>You don't talk about the fact</i>
<i>that actually he's</i> a <i>traitor.</i>
<i>This is like infection.</i>
<i>If you put
the mirror in his face,</i>
<i>it would finish even/thing.</i>
Five years ago,
you were buying guns
and trying to kill people
that you are fighting now,
risking your life
to save their lives.
That was like
a crazy transformation.
In my heart,
I understand the process,
I understand why I came
to these conclusions.
<i>While doing that, I kept
in mind where I'm coming from,</i>
<i>and even/thing
in my surroundings</i>
<i>reminds me of that.</i>
<i>But that change
was veW, veq/ radical,</i>
to the level that
you start to feel
that you're living a dream.
Gonen: <i>He was considered
highly, highly dangerous.</i>
<i>What happened in the beginning,</i>
the fact that he thought
about killing his handler,
as something that nothing
could clean from his record.
Nothing.
Doubt is the most important tool
for a handler.
If you don't doubt,
you will have a failure.
You have to doubt.
Now, for me, as a handler,
soon it was very hard to doubt,
<i>and this is</i>
a <i>big danger for</i> a <i>handler,</i>
<i>when he forgets that
the source is not</i> a <i>friend,</i>
<i>but he's</i> a <i>potential enemy.</i>
They exaggerated, you know,
with howthey handled me.
They really exaggerated.
<i>Like imagine just having</i>
<i>dozens of agents</i>
<i>just to bring you
for</i> a <i>meeting,</i>
<i>while, you know,
you could just walk</i>
<i>to the meeting by yourself.</i>
<i>I remember once, there was</i>
a <i>song playing in the car,</i>
and one ofthe officers
turned it off,
and I was like,
"Oh man, youjust killed it,"
and I did this with my finger,
<i>and he says,
"Well, why did you do that?"</i>
I was like, "Do what?"
He's like,
"Do this with your finger."
I was like, you know,
"l was expressing
that he killed the song."
And he was like,
"Don't do this again."
And we start
a big, big argument.
I'm working with people
who does not
appreciate me somehow.
Or does not respect me.
Or does not trust me.
<i>I was not fooled</i>
by the Israelis' nice attitude.
Actually,
the attitude was not nice.
The attitude was rough.
They were always suspicious.
They were always playing
that they know everything,
but they did not
know everything.
And these kind of things,
you know, it was
big discouragement.
<i>You 're risking your life.</i>
You're doing the impossible.
You're crossing all the lines.
You're somehow betraying
your family and culture,
and here you are, and...
they still don't trust you.
Gonen: <i>I felt that in order
to keep him as</i> a <i>source,</i>
I need to do something.
<i>I met Mosab
without any bodyguards,</i>
against the protocol.
It was like
something you don't do.
Mosab: <i>I know that Gonen was
breaking the law of the Agency.</i>
<i>And I knew that he could get
in lots of trouble doing that.</i>
Now, to me, it was very
important, when he did that.
This meant to me
that this man trusts me,
and that was very,
very important for me to know,
because I trusted him,
and I wanted to make sure
that he can trust me too,
because the type ofjob
we were doing together
was very, very dangerous,
and that
was needed at that time.
From that point and on,
he was with me 150%.
<i>Gonen:
The Green Prince called me,</i>
<i>and told me that
five suicide bombers</i>
<i>came and asked for his help.</i>
We knewthat we can easily
stop them,
but we also knew
that this would put Mosab
in a very difficult situation.
Mosab:
<i>My</i> brother's telling me
<i>two strangers are outside.</i>
They said, "We supposed to carry
an operation soon,
and our guy,
our man, was arrested
by Israel a few days ago,
and it's not safe for us
to stay in the same house,
and we don't have money,
and we need someone
to give us a safe house."
<i>I remember I just got
my salaq/ from the Agency,</i>
and I told them,
"Take the money,
go to this address,
and tell the guy
that I sent you,
and give him the money,
and he will give you
a safe place to stay,
and wait for me there.
Don't go anywhere."
<i>( indistinct radio chatter )</i>
Gonen: <i>Killing them
is the easiest solution,</i>
because if you kill them,
first of all,
you prevent the attack,
and secondly,
that person
cannot expose your source.
<i>But for him,
it was veq/ hard</i> to...
to be part of assassination.
If I was fighting
to stop killing of human beings
on the Israeli side,
I had to keep
that level of integrity.
Even I knewthat those people
were extremely dangerous.
<i>( Man speaks
Hebrew over radio )</i>
<i>- ( gunshot )
- ( indistinct radio chatter )</i>
I captured them, but we knew
that sooner or later
they will bring up his name
as someone that's helped them.
And this is a situation
where you can'tjust ignore it,
because if you ignore it,
you expose him.
<i>So we arranged</i> a <i>huge scene</i>
<i>where Special Forces</i>
<i>came to Betounya,
where Mosab lived,</i>
<i>tq/ing to capture him,</i>
<i>and he fled away</i>
<i>only seconds
before they arrived.</i>
<i>I needed to coordinate it</i>
in a way that is realistic,
but not dangerous for him,
'cause they could shoot him.
<i>( Indistinct radio chatter )</i>
Mosab:
They evacuated my family.
Now, Gonen was there
interrogating my mom,
asking her "Where is Mosab?"
and she says, "He escaped."
And Gonen was pretending
all the time that
"No way, we knowthat
he's in the house,
and if he does not
surrender right now,
we're gonna kill him."
And my mother knewthat
I was not in the house,
and she was like, "Okay,
you're not going to find him."
<i>And when they stan' shooting
and finally launch</i> a <i>missile</i>
<i>in our living room
and burn half of the house,</i>
my mother saw how serious
their idea was
about capturing me,
to the level when I came
next day, she told me,
"Go underground,
don't go anywhere,
don't come back ever."
This was, you know, only a game
in order to show everybody
that he's a wanted terrorist
and we try to catch him.
Mosab: Finally,
even/body in the city believed
<i>that! was wanted
by Israel, and this way,</i>
I got a chance,
since I became a wanted person,
I got a chance to hang out
with otherwanted Hamas members
that we have been
looking for them for years.
(speaking Hebrew)
<i>Gonen: A suicide bomber</i>
<i>blew himself up in the hotel,</i>
<i>killing more than 15 people.</i>
I understood at that point that
the game is going to change.
We decided that
we are going to take
all the necessary measures
to act and destroy
the infrastructure
of every terror element
that exists.
The Israeli Army
started to enter
cities in the West Bank.
<i>The Green Prince
was</i> a <i>key player</i>
<i>in many operations,
and one of the operations</i>
<i>was to reveal where
the Hamas leaders are hiding.</i>
<i>Our goal was</i>
<i>to tn/ and get
as much terrorists as we can,</i>
<i>as much extremists as we can.</i>
<i>So we had like maybe 24 hours</i>
<i>before even/body
would run away.</i>
M <i>osa</i> b :
<i>The Israeli politicians</i>
<i>did not know
about my involvement</i>
with the Israeli Intelligence.
And all they knew
that Hassan Yousef
is a terrorist.
<i>And there was pressure</i>
to assassinate
all top Hamas leaders
who were involved
in the movement
that 'caused the death of
hundreds of Israeli citizens.
And my fatherwas the top
Hamas leader in the West Bank,
where most ofthe suicide
bombing attacks came from.
Mosab was terrified.
He knewthat
it's a matter of time
that his father
would get into the list.
<i>Mosab called us,
"Let's arrest my father.</i>
And then I'll know
that my father is in prison,
and nothing happens to him."
Mosab: <i>I was cam/ing
veq/ huge responsibility.</i>
I knewwhat I did
was not shameful,
and what I did was
very, very important
<i>and was necessity.</i>
Mosab:
<i>There</i> is not lots of money.
You're not paid as people think
you're paid millions,
not even thousands.
You are risking everything,
and then there is
no celebration.
I promise you, we never opened
a bottle of champagne
because we saved
dozens of lives.
The prize was
a different kind of prize.
We told him you can'tjust,
you know, finish
with the Second Intifada,
finish with Defense Shield,
and go back to your life.
It's, you know,
something that won't happen.
Everybody expects you
to be arrested.
We have to do it.
And he needed to agree,
and he eventually agreed,
to go and spend time in prison,
although he did nothing wrong.
He was working for us,
but this was the only way
to keep him alive.
<i>( Metal door clangs )</i>
<i>( chains jingling )</i>
<i>Mosab:
We were in the Maskoveieh,</i>
<i>where I was torfured
the first time.</i>
<i>My father was there,</i>
<i>and they made it look
like interrogation cell.</i>
<i>Once the door is closed,</i>
Gonen would come in,
and we just continue our work.
<i>And then when
I come back to the cell,</i>
<i>I'm totally exhausted
from woming all day long,</i>
so my father
and the other cell prisoners
would think that ljust had
a rough day interrogation.
Allahu Akbar.
<i>Mosab:
I'm looking at my father,</i>
<i>just living his reality,</i>
<i>not knowing
what's really happening.</i>
<i>In</i> a <i>perfect wofld,</i>
I wanted him to know everything,
but to give him
that kind of information,
it's not going
to make sense to him.
And that's why
we lived
in two different worlds.
Gonen: <i>I have</i> a feeling
<i>Hassan Yousef knew Mosab
is woming for us.</i>
Like a husband that
his wife is cheating on him.
And all the signs
are written on the wall,
but he doesn't want
to look at it.
Hassan Yousef had
all the signs on the wall.
Palestinians now are
only waking up to the news
that Yasser Arafat has died.
It came at 5:30 in the morning
here in Ramallah.
Gonen: <i>When Arafat died,
we didn't really know</i>
<i>what's going
to happen afterwards.</i>
<i>We were worried
about the possibility</i>
that Hamas is going
to take over Ramallah.
So again,
we did what we know to do.
We started
to gather information.
<i>Mosab:
When I got out of prison,</i>
<i>my father was released as well.</i>
<i>Hamas and other Palestinian
factions were preparing</i>
<i>for the elections.</i>
<i>The Hamas strategy was to bring</i>
<i>their militan/ wing members</i>
<i>down to the street
to show power.</i>
<i>It saddened him
to see the movement</i>
<i>is getting out of his control,</i>
<i>and young militan/ guys
taking over</i>
<i>just sending even/body
to destruction.</i>
<i>He was veq/ conflicted.</i>
<i>He did not have anybody to talk
about his frustration.</i>
I was the only person there
that could listen to him
and understand
what he was saying.
<i>We had</i> a <i>group
of foreigners come in,</i>
<i>and I invited them
to come meet with my father.</i>
I told them,
"Here is the situation.
Would you please help him see
what you see from the outside?"
<i>And he met
with lots of seculars</i>
<i>who shared with him
alternative ways</i>
<i>of fighting occupation
without causing bloodshed.</i>
And somehow he was comfortable
with that approach,
<i>which, you know, practically
brought him to the level</i>
<i>to think of having</i>
a <i>truce with Israel.</i>
Now, when he start to share
what he understands
with the Hamas leaderships
in Gaza Strip,
they didn't know
where he was coming from.
<i>Israeli Shin Bet
never came to me and said,</i>
<i>"Hey, how about you convince
your father to hold</i> a <i>truce?"</i>
Actually, they did not
like that very much.
The Israeli Intelligence
wanted me to act
like somebody who's zealous,
somebody who's angry at Israel,
somebody who does not
believe in peace,
somebody who's a terrorist,
because that was the goal,
to infiltrate
terrorist organizations
by playing that
you are a terrorist.
Now, when I did
the opposite of that
to convince my father
that a truce with Israel
will save human lives,
and my father was convinced
for the individual
who works within the Agency,
that was, "Wow, that's great."
But for the mind ofthe Agency,
that was not good.
That was not "Bravo."
That was like,
"Stop what you're doing,
and focus, you know,
on our game."
Mosab has his own views,
and he never, never agreed
just to get orders
without thinking
and without processing.
And he didn't act
like a very religious guy.
And this was another concern,
because we were afraid
all the time that someone
will suspect him,
not because
what he does for Israel,
but because the way he acts.
<i>( Explosion )</i>
(speaking Arabic)
Mosab:
<i>My</i> father got the word
<i>from Gaza saying that
Israel hit us with</i> a <i>missile.</i>
He was invited
to Al Jazeera to comment.
He was, of course, furious,
he was very disappointed,
because at that time,
he worked very hard
to establish a hudna,
a truce, with Israel.
<i>Gonen told me,
"We didn't</i> do <i>it. "</i>
So I asked the guys
at Al Jazeera,
"Do you have a filming
of the explosion?"
I'm looking at the video
again and again and again,
<i>and always the explosion
came from under.</i>
<i>And the smoke
was completely white,</i>
<i>which is the material</i>
that Hamas used to build
their homemade missiles.
<i>There was vehicle
that had in it</i>
<i>tons of missiles
and explosives.</i>
<i>Something went wrong
with the car</i>
<i>that simply exploded and killed</i>
<i>all these civilians
who were around it.</i>
<i>I brought my father
to the control room</i>
<i>and I showed him
how the explosion happened.</i>
It was obvious and clear,
but he simply ignored it.
(speaking Arabic)
<i>That starfed</i> a <i>new war.</i>
Suddenly, you had missiles,
which we never had before.
<i>The wofld changed,</i>
<i>and it became
ten times more violent.</i>
Part of the reaction
was to arrest
all top Hamas leaders.
<i>I received</i> a <i>phone call</i>
<i>from the Shin Bet
office saying,</i>
<i>"Your father will be arrested. "</i>
And l was like,
"Well, ifthis is the case,
this is the case."
Then when I received
the second part ofthe order,
which was,
"And you are going too."
I was like, "That's impossible.
I'm not going tojail again."
Our part was to calm him down,
to explain, to reason it,
and explain why we do it,
and it became
a very hard mission to do.
I remember I start even
to cry, you know,
because I could not
even understand
or absorb the whole situation.
I went back home afterwards
just to have the last dinner,
you know,
with my mom and my dad.
My dad was
in the kitchen cooking,
and he told me, he asked me,
"Why don't you come
give me a hand?"
Because usually when
he's cooking l like to help him.
And usually, you know,
there's a competition,
who's got like
the best recipe and all that.
And you know,
it's like he wanted just to play
the same game, not knowing
what's waiting for him.
So I thought to myself,
you know, let's just forget
what's gonna happen
in a few hours,
and we got in the kitchen,
we start cooking,
chopping vegetables,
and preparing food
for everybody.
Actually, l thought that,
that's like a good opportunity
just to do something good
for the family
before this disaster happens.
When he was ready for bed,
ljust hugged him
and I told him,
"Have a good night,"
without, you know,
showing anything.
<i>I went upstairs to my room,</i>
and I got myself ready
for the moment.
<i>- ( Pounding on door )
- ( soldier speaking Hebrew)</i>
My father came up to me,
he said, "We have to go."
I told him, "What's going on?"
He said, "We are arrested."
And they're asking for you too,
so put some warm clothes
and come with me.
<i>( Iarge crowd chattering )</i>
Male reporter: <i>A</i> new era begins
in the Middle East
<i>with</i> a <i>sweeping victoq/
by Hamas</i>
in the Palestinian Territories.
The militant group
will be running things now,
and world capitals
are struggling
to adjust to that reality.
Male reporter: We're covering
all of the angles,
<i>tq/ing to bring you the reporfs
from Ramallah, Jerusalem...</i>
<i>( oveflapping applause on TV )</i>
Mosab: <i>I came to the realization
that we were fighting</i> a <i>ghost.</i>
And I was tired already
at that time,
and I needed a break.
Gonen: <i>Mosab spend
more than six months in prison.</i>
<i>He came back really exhausted.</i>
<i>Mentally, he was exhausted.</i>
<i>He told me,</i>
"lt's very hard for me
to keep working with you."
He was lying to his family,
he was lying to his father,
he needed to lie
to the Palestinian Authority,
to Hamas,
he needed to hide things
from the Shin Bet about himself,
and every given second,
he needed to lie to someone.
He didn't live his life.
He was living life
<i>where he needs all the time
to process lies.</i>
How can you establish a life,
or a family,
or a relationship of any kind
based on the false identity,
that you know
that this identity at some point
either it gets exposed
or it gets killed'?
Gonen:
The Shin Bet expected me
to handle the situation
and convince him to go on.
<i>You stan', you know,
to lie to yourself</i>
<i>and to him, and say,
"Well, you know, but,</i>
let's keep another month,
and see what's happening,
maybe you'll feel
a little bit better.
And let me help you.
Do you need something?"
You take him maybe somewhere,
you buy him a present.
You know, you try to keep,
keep it working.
Though you know
that as a person,
you need to let him go.
<i>I saw Mosab
outside of Shin Bet facilities,</i>
<i>and I let him</i> a <i>few times
to take</i> a <i>break,</i>
<i>to go into Israel</i>
<i>to rest</i> a <i>little bit
for one day.</i>
<i>I rented</i> a <i>car for him.</i>
<i>I found</i> a <i>place,</i>
a <i>hotel that he can rest in,</i>
<i>and then go back.</i>
<i>This was</i> a <i>veq/ imporfant step</i>
<i>to make him understand</i>
<i>how imporfant he is</i>
f0!' me 8S a PGTSOH.
<i>For the Shin Bet,
it's veq/ dramatic,</i>
<i>because this is</i>
a <i>violation</i> of <i>the protocol,</i>
<i>a veq/ bad one.</i>
<i>But I thought</i>
that they will understand
that my intentions
were clean and pure.
And they looked
at it differently.
<i>I</i> was told again and again
<i>the Shin Bet is the family,
it's your family.</i>
<i>I never felt
that this is my job.</i>
<i>It was going to the family,</i>
<i>and then suddenly,
the family is against me.</i>
They said I did not work
by the rule,
or by the Shin Bet way,
and they took me to court,
and dismissed me from my duty.
Mosab:
All he said was good bye,
and I was like,
"Gosh, this is really bad news."
<i>All the doubt, the suspicion
that I had with the Agency,</i>
<i>I overcame
only through the trust</i>
<i>that I could establish
with Gonen,</i>
<i>and the personal relationship
that I built with him.</i>
So for me, he was
really a gift from heaven,
to bejust there
to take care of me.
And when he was like,
"That's it,
I'm going somewhere else,"
I knewthat I am not
going to see him again.
Gonen:
He got a new handler,
<i>and he didn't like
this handler at all.</i>
<i>They had fights.</i>
<i>This guy tried, you know,</i>
to teach Mosab everything
from the beginning.
<i>They decided to put him
on</i> a <i>polygraph test</i>
<i>to show him who is in charge.</i>
Mosab: <i>It was impossible
for someone like me</i>
<i>to pass the test.</i>
<i>When they asked me,</i>
<i>'Did you plan attacks
against the state of Israel? "</i>
You know, this is
what we did on a daily basis.
You know, that was myjob,
to pretend that
we are planning attacks.
<i>L/lfith that said, you know,
how can you say yes or no?</i>
<i>And now here I am</i>
answering the machine,
and the guy from behind the desk
that I never met before,
and trying to prove to him
something
that I could not prove.
You trusted me
with the lives of your troops,
with your own lives,
with the secrets of the Agency,
big secrets,
and now you're coming back
to the first square
for your old suspicion
and old doubt'?
That broke bones
between me and the Agency.
<i>And at that moment,</i>
<i>that was</i> a <i>final
decision for me,</i>
<i>that was the last time</i>
I want to work for the Agency
or do anything for it.
<i>They tried by temptation,</i>
<i>giving me
an offer to open</i> a <i>company</i>
<i>to help me achieve, you know,</i>
<i>things that people dream about
and they don't get.</i>
<i>They could not threaten me</i>
<i>because they knew
that I knew the game.</i>
And simply, I kept insisting
for a few months
that I have to leave.
Finally, they agreed,
with two conditions.
<i>I have to bring</i> a <i>solid cover</i>
<i>how I left.</i>
<i>It was simply
an operation for my jaw.</i>
<i>And I had to go to doctors
and bring these papers.</i>
The second condition was
that I come back
and work for the Shin Bet.
I takejust a long vacation.
They preferred
that I go to Europe.
They did not want me to go
to the United States of America.
<i>Now, Spain and Europe,
and all that,</i>
<i>Israel simply could put me
in</i> a <i>case and send me back</i>
<i>to the Palestinian Territories
if they had to,</i>
<i>but in America,
it was different stow.</i>
<i>The American government,
in general,</i>
don't tolerate
any Israeli activity
on the American soil
without cooperation
with the American Intelligence.
<i>My mom knew that
there was</i> a <i>possibility</i>
<i>that's gonna take a few years
before I come back.</i>
<i>She told me,
"You do the surgeW,</i>
<i>if you get</i> a <i>chance
to finish your Master's</i>
<i>in the United States,
just do it. "</i>
<i>You know, "I wish you luck,"</i>
<i>and she was just sad</i>
<i>that I was leaving,</i>
but she knew
how much I suffered,
you know, for the family,
and all over the years,
and she wanted me
also to find my life,
so she was kinda
finally okay with that.
And we hugged,
and we said good bye.
<i>To go to</i> a <i>new culture,</i>
<i>to have to build
even/thing from scratch,</i>
<i>that was
the most difficult thing</i>
<i>for any human being.</i>
<i>I was conflicted</i>
<i>with my own identity.</i>
I was invited to a Bible study.
I started to build
a new relationship
with a new community
that had
a totally different faith.
<i>It was fun.</i>
<i>It was</i> a <i>peaceful environment.</i>
<i>And to go
to this kind of community,</i>
<i>and to be loved unconditionally</i>
was very comforting,
it was very important to me.
<i>It filled</i> a <i>veq/
imporfant gap in my life.</i>
<i>I applied for political asylum</i>
<i>in the first few months
in secret,</i>
and it was rejected
by the Department
of Homeland Security.
<i>The FBI was told
by the Israeli Intelligence</i>
<i>that the son
of</i> a <i>top Hamas leader</i>
<i>is hanging out in California,</i>
<i>and we don't know
exactly what he's doing there,</i>
<i>thinking that the FBI is going</i>
<i>to just put me on an airplane
and send me back.</i>
There was always a problem
with how can I convince
those people that I am
not involved in terrorism.
<i>I shared the stow with
the core group in the church.</i>
And I was expecting
an immediate support,
but to look at people's faces
and see fear,
and see doubt,
that's something
that I was not expecting.
<i>They were not only
not believing,</i>
<i>they were also scared</i>
<i>of the fact that I was there.</i>
<i>Nobody would believe my stow.</i>
No one.
I was without anything.
I was without a shelter.
I became without a job, jobless.
I became without a community.
I became completely alone,
and my intention
was to go public.
<i>I knew the moment
I am gonna say</i>
<i>that I womed for
the Israeli Intelligence.</i>
<i>First of all, I am done.</i>
<i>I have no future.</i>
I'm gonna become from a prince
to a traitor, immediately.
Nobody's going
to sympathize with me.
<i>I'm going to bring
lots of shame</i>
<i>to my mother, to my father.</i>
It was the shame
that I had to face,
you know, as a human being.
Since I was a child,
I was raped.
I could not tell
my parents. Why'?
<i>So that was like finally</i>
<i>a chance or an opporfunity</i>
<i>to fight against
this dangerous enemy,</i>
the force of shame.
(numbers beeping)
<i>My father had access
to</i> a <i>cell phone</i>
<i>that was smuggled
to prison at that time.</i>
<i>So I called him
and told I him,</i>
<i>"Listen, I'm writing</i> a book.
The book is going to come out,
and I'm telling the world
about my relationship
with the Israeli Intelligence.
Iam not who you think I am.
I worked for Israel
for ten years.
I put you and myself
in prison to protect you.
And you are not
assassinated today
because of this arrangement."
<i>He told me, "Listen, come back,</i>
<i>and I will protect you.</i>
<i>Don't wom/ about anybody. "</i>
I told him,
"l am not coming back,"
<i>and I asked him, actually,
in that conversation</i>
<i>to disown me, because I knew</i>
<i>the pressure of the society.</i>
And he told me
this is not an option,
while he was grieving, you know.
He was in lots of pain,
he was under shock.
He told me, "You are my son,
and you will continue
to be my son.
No one can take that away."
Male reporter #1: ...putting
his own life in danger
<i>by going public with his stow</i>
<i>in one remamable book called,
"Son of Hamas",</i>
<i>giving</i> a <i>never
before seen</i> look...
Female reporter:
Mosab Hassan Yousef <i>says</i>
<i>that he turned against Hamas
because he believed...</i>
Male reporter #2: ...served
<i>as</i> Israel's most valuable spy
<i>inside Hamas
for over</i> a <i>decade...</i>
Male <i>reporter #3:
young man who saw bad things</i>
<i>happening and decided
to take</i> a <i>stand.</i>
Your own father
has written from prison,
where he still is, a statement:
<i>( female host reading )</i>
He said that you were
a collaborator,
collaborating with the enemy.
He said that you're betraying
Palestinians, betraying Islam.
How do you respond to that'?
Mosab: <i>I knew that
I was really hurfing</i>
people I love,
and people
who loved me very much.
When I thought about
my brothers and sisters,
those are like,
were my children.
And they never had a problem
without calling me.
And I always found a solution.
And that was the first time
when my brother called me
asking for a solution,
but unfortunately,
I was the problem,
and I could not provide
a solution for the first time.
I felt hopeless.
I felt that
I stabbed him in the back.
Actually, l felt like
l took each one ofthem
and I put them on the altar
and slaughtered them,
all of them.
<i>The law was veq/ clear
with the deportation case.</i>
"You were affiliated,
at some point of your life,
with Hamas organization.
You bought guns with
the intention of killing people.
So that's enough.
It doesn't matter
what you did afterwards."
<i>The law says if you have
that kind of histoW,</i>
<i>you don't qualify
to get American,</i>
<i>to become American citizen.</i>
But how much danger is Yousef
really in if he's deported'?
Al Qaeda immediately issued
a death sentence for him.
Hamas leaders in Gaza...
Gonen: <i>One day,
I see</i> a <i>big picture</i>
<i>of The Green Prince, page one,</i>
<i>in the Arutz newspaper.</i>
I felt my heart's, you know,
beating hard and--
You need to understand,
The Green Prince was
one of the most sensitive
secrets ofthe Shin Bet.
The option to have him
on the front page
ofthe newspaper, something
I couldn't even consider.
I was shocked.
I started to think, you know,
"How come he's
in the United States'?
What's going on?"
<i>I read that he left
the West Bank,</i>
<i>he converfed to Christianity,</i>
<i>and that he lives
in the United States, homeless.</i>
He was in real trouble.
And I knew it.
<i>I really felt responsible
for Mosab,</i>
<i>as</i> a <i>source,
and as</i> a <i>human being.</i>
<i>I felt that,
as his former handler,</i>
I cannot let him just meet
his destiny without helping him.
<i>I starfed to think about
of all the legal implications</i>
<i>of what I'm going to do.</i>
<i>What will be the Shin Bet
response for that?</i>
<i>Am I allowed to do it?</i>
I knewthat if I'll contact
the Shin Bet
and ask their permission,
I'll get a "no",
and I didn't want
to get this "no."
<i>I felt that I really need
to go and meet him.</i>
<i>I thought that
by exposing myself,</i>
<i>I can be arrested and accused
by the Shin Bet of treason.</i>
But I knewthat this is
what I need to do.
<i>And then I took off
and I went</i> to <i>San Diego.</i>
<i>This was</i> a <i>veq/ tough flight.</i>
It was passing not only
geographical borders.
<i>I needed
to cross mental borders.</i>
<i>And I was walking down</i>
<i>in</i> a <i>long corridor,</i>
and in the end,
I see Mosab standing.
And I approached him,
and we hugged
and started to laugh.
I don't know why laughing,
but we were
standing there laughing
for like,
I don't know, ten minutes.
We were laughing this, you know,
this was like breaking
everything, all the borders,
all the problems, everything.
The son of a Hamas founder
sought sanctuary here
in California.
The Federal Government is now
pushing for his deportation,
claiming he poses
a threat to the U.S.
Gonen: Mosab told me,
"For some reason,
they misread the book
and they really think
that I'm a terrorist,
and they think that I'm a threat
to the United States."
Homeland Security will argue
that he has provided
material support
to terrorist organizations
in court tomorrow.
They want him deported.
We'll be live at the...
I got really mad.
You know, I thought to myself,
you know, it couldn't be.
You know, he helped us
for more than ten years.
<i>I called the Shin Bet.</i>
<i>I asked them to give me
instructions and they didn 't.</i>
<i>They didn't respond.</i>
And I said, that's it.
You know, this is ridiculous.
Male reporter: How many times
<i>have</i> you ever heard
<i>an agent of Shin Bet,</i>
<i>the Israeli Secret Service,
go public?</i>
<i>This is</i> a <i>man
who was Mosab Hassan's handler</i>
<i>for many, many years,
and he believes now</i>
<i>it is his solemn moral duty
to stand up, to go public,</i>
<i>which is</i> a <i>risk to his own life</i>
<i>because he believes
Mosab Hassan...</i>
Gonen: It's notjust
a reality show
<i>that you watch on TV and say,</i>
<i>"Oh, let's see what
the judge is going to decide."</i>
Mosab is going to stay
in the U.S. and live,
or Mosab is going
to be deported to Jordan,
and then who knows
what will happen'?
Probably, he will
get killed somehow.
I couldn'tjust sit
silently and watch it.
Male news host: We got a really
big development to this stow.
<i>The United States
has now dropped its push</i>
<i>to depon' Mosab Hassan Yousef,</i>
<i>because of what
lawyers called "new evidence."</i>
<i>Homeland Security previously
called him</i> a <i>security threat</i>
<i>because of his ties
to the militant group Hamas.</i>
<i>This man, Yousef, is the son
of one of its founders,</i>
<i>but after spending ten years
as a spy for Israel,</i>
<i>and convening to Christianity,</i>
<i>he says deportation
would mean cerfain death.</i>
During a 15 minute
hearing this morning,
a U.S. Department of Homeland
Security attorney announced
that the government
was dropping its objections,
and an emigration
judge ruled that,
pending a routine background
check, Yousef can stay.
Gonen: <i>The Shin Bet had
the ability to stop me.</i>
<i>They didn't do it.</i>
When I look at it today,
I say, you know, maybe this is
theirway to tell me,
"Okay, no, you can go on.
Okay, we're not
going to approve it,
we don't like it,
but we don't stop you.
And this is ourway
to help Mosab."
And today, I really believe
this is what they did.
Maybe we're not family
in the blood,
but the bond between us
is much stronger than the bond
of brothers or family or blood.
The bond between us
is the bond oftruth,
and it's unbreakable.
And he knows the truth,
and he took a stand
for the truth,
unlike many Shin Bet agents
who worked with me side by side
and saw how much we put effort
to stop terrorist attacks.
And all ofthem
saw me, you know,
struggling, facing deportation,
being disowned
for the sake of the state
that we fought for,
and none ofthem came out
to support, none ofthem.
<i>Gonen: Thisjoumey,</i>
<i>for me as</i> a <i>person,
as</i> a <i>human being,</i>
<i>is always and it is still</i>
<i>I think the most imporfant
journey of my life.</i>
Not because of Mosab,
not because ofthe Shin Bet,
because of me,
because during the time,
and along the way,
I learned more about myself,
about life, about friendship.
Gonen risked his life
to save mine.
And I hope that
one day, you know,
people will be able to see
the beauty ofthis man's heart,
and I hope that
our people in the region
will learn from this experience,
how two people
like Gonen and myself
can come to a place
where we can trust each other
and work to be constructive,
and to build,
and instead of destroy
and spend our lives fighting.
Gonen is a brother today,
and I won't hesitate
to sacrifice my life
to save his,
because he already did,
and I owe him.
