"Grandma, do we have
any dark butter?"
What's Dark butter?
I'm thinking, maybe she watch
"Food Network" or something.
So I say, "what's dark

But Tatiana,
that baby doesn't
deserve this, Oscar.
She don't know what's going on.
So, I guess that's why she
asked me why you love
taking your vacations
more than being with her.
She ain't say that.
So I'm the liar now.
Ma you gotta tell her
that I love her.
Tell her, I ain't gonna leave her.
Tell her yourself!
The Next time you call home

Or better yet, let her
come visit you here.

- You've already exposed...!
You've already exposed her to this.
So, you gonna leave me?
You gonna leave me again,
What kinda Mum is you?
You wanna fuck around
and leave me in here?
You ain't never have my

- What you got for me?
- 22 years old male,
scapula GSW. He was lying
face down when he was shot.
On three. One..two... three.
- What's blood pressure?
- 72 solid.
- Was he moving his limbs?
- Yes, moving arms and legs.
I'm gonna need a chest tube.
We gotta get him
upstairs, right away.
Excuse me.
My son is Oscar Julius Grant III. He's
been shot, and they told me to come here.
N-T. Yes.
Okay, he's in surgery. Go to the
ICU and someone will be out soon.
- And then, where?
- Right there.
Is that blood in?
Scissors.
Suction.
Hey, listen. None of that.
None of that.
It's not the time or the place.
Hey, we gotta keep him positive.
We gotta. We gotta let these
people do their job.
He's gonna be fine.
Let's put all our energy
toward Oscar right now.
I know y'all are upset.
We gotta lift him up.
Let's keep him lifted up.
Let's keep him lifted up.
- Mrs. Johnson?
- Yes.
How is he? How is he?
Mrs. Johnson, as you know..
Your son has been shot.
We've stabilized him,
but he's critical.
Critical. What is that?
Well, he has massive internal bleeding
and we had to remove the right lung.
His lung? How is he... How is
he going to be able to breathe?
He's on a breathing
machine, right now.
His breathing is stable.
The main problem is the
internal bleeding.
We've had some difficulty
stopping the bleeding..
That's getting his
blood to clot.
He hasn't fully responded
to the transfusions, yet.
But he's going to make it right?
But he's going to make it.
I promise you, we're gonna
do everything we can okay?
Please do whatever
you can, please.
We gotta lift him up, you all.
We gotta lift Oscar up.
You all, let's pray.
<i>Heavenly father...</i>
<i>We kneel before you..
And ask you..</i>
<i>To put your healing hands
around your child.</i>
<i>We ask you dear Lord...</i>
<i>to operate through
these doctors;</i>
<i>Breathe strength into their hands
Lord, as they work on him.</i>
<i>We are asking you right
now, to heal him.</i>
<i>Heal him Lord, so we can hold
him and see his smile again.</i>
<i>In your name, we pray. Amen.</i>
He didn't make it.
I need to see him.
Okay, you can see him.
But they don't want you go
into the room and detach him.
Cos they ruled it a homicide.
I need to see him.
I need to see him.
- I can take her.
- Okay.
I told him to catch the train.
I told him to catch Bart!
I didn't know they
were gonna hurt him.
I should have just
let him drive.
I should have let him drive.
I wanted him to be safe.
You gotta let me hug him.
Please, let me hug him. Please.
He didn't like to be alone!
Come on, T.
Where's Daddy?
