- Ask him.
- Shh.
- Ask him!
- Shh.
Look at him, Grandpa!
Ask him!
Ryan, that's enough.
Um, I'm sorry.
He, uh—
He thinks you're Santa Claus.
I am.
- Merry Christmas.
- Uh, merry Christmas.
Nuts. I should have
got his autograph.

What is the problem?
Your Santa Claus is wearing
a topcoat and a fedora.
Hyah!
That's not my Santa Claus.
Right. Now,
throw it out and bring it up
right up high...
and down she comes!
Hmph.
Just in the wrist, you see.
It's really quite simple, you know,
when you get the knack of it.
Now then, why don't you-
Okay, pops, come on.
It's my turn.
- Now, uh, give me the whip.
- What have you just been drinking?
I just had a little
something to keep me warm.
Now, give me the whip.
- You are intoxicated, sir!
- Yeah, and you are a pain in the butt.
- Now, give me that whip.
- Let me tell you something.
You are a disgrace!
Do you have any idea how many
children are watching you at this
very minute, and you're drinking?
- Just give me back the whip.
- Let me tell you something, young man.
When you put on this suit,
you represent something...
that has a great meaning and significance
to millions of people all over the world!
Now, I could overlook...
your poorly manufactured jacket,
or even your ludicrously
unbelievable beard,
or perhaps your phonily padded tummy,
but I will not tolerate
public drunkenness.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Hey, can I get a cop over here?
- That's a very good idea!
- Officer!
- Hey, wait a minute, you.
Mrs. Walker!
Mrs. Walker!
Mrs. Walker!
We need your help here!
Ah, ah, ah.
If you’re not with the parade, sir,
you have to get back up on the sidewalk.
I need to see whomever's in charge...
in order to alert them to
this man's drunken condition.
- Kiss my-
- Don't! Easy!
Take it easy!
Gramps, come on.
Hey, come on.
Let's go for a little walk, huh?
Hmm.
That man's a degenerate!
It's time to go to work
up in the old office.
Little drafty there.
Hey, uh, let’s just
watch the parade, okay?
Come on.
Okay, now, settle in here.
Whoop!
- Oh, my God.
- If this darn costume fit-
Okay, we'll show this guy
how to do it.
Whoa!
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night.
Sir?
Sir, excuse me.
- Hello. I'm Dorey Walker.
- Oh.
Director of Special Projects
for C.F. Cole's department store.
It's my pleasure. As a matter of fact,
I was looking for you a few moments ago.
There's no doubt you saw
your Santa Claus is inebriated.
I know. He has created
such a terrible problem.
Millions of children are watching
here and on television,
and they're expecting to see Santa Claus,
and right now we don't have one.
That is a terrible problem.
Would you do it?
Would you be our Santa Claus?
- Me?
- Well, do you have any experience?
- Well, just a little.
- Great. I'm sure you'll be fine.
- Isn't there someone else you could ask?
- Sir, the parade...
has started already.
It's you, right now,
or else there is no Santa...
in the Cole's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
Might I perhaps have a
moment to think about it?
Don't worry about a thing.
Just... be yourself.
Now Dasher, now Dancer,
now Prancer and Vixen!
Now Comet, now Cupid,
now Donner and Blitzen!
Hey!
[Man on TV] Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
- This Santa Claus is fantastic.
- Did he sign a contract?
- No. There wasn't any time.
Myrna's gonna have him
sign after the parade.
She'll have him fill out
his employment papers, and he'll
start work in the morning.
The only condition he insisted on is that
he be able to wear his own Santa suit.
He has his own Santa suit?
Apparently.
Well, if it's horrible,
we'll make him wear one of ours.
I'm going home.
You're not gonna watch
the rest of the parade?
No, I think I've had
quite enough for one day, thank you.
- I will see you in the morning.
- Okay.
Chin-chin.
Merry Christmas!
Susan?
Mom, I'm still at Mr. Bedford's.
We can see the parade from his window.
So put on something comfortable
and come on over.
P.S. Mr. Bedford put
the turkey in the oven.
He said you forgot to sew up the
turkey's bottom. The stuffing'll fall out.
But he told me
not to say anything because...
he loves you,
and he wants to kiss you,
and he thinks you're the most
beautiful woman in the whole world!
Do you know how much it costs
to make this parade?
Uh--
a million dollars.
- Two million dollars?
- One point six,
and it's probably a big mistake,
because some guy's gonna buy Cole's...
and turn it into a junk store.
That's not gonna happen.
Two big banks just came in...
and they rescued Cole's,
so you better check your sources.
But Cole's has to
pay them back plus interest.
If they don't sell
a lot of stuff at Christmas,
you can forget about it, pal.
Oh. Well, I think
you should ask Santa Claus...
to give Cole's an interest-free loan
for Christmas.
What do you think about that?
- That's a good one.
- You know what? It might happen.
I mean, Santa Claus, he does
some pretty amazing things.
Bryan, you know what?
I know.
- You know what?
- The secret.
- What secret?
- Santa Claus.
I've known for a long time.
He's not real.
- Says who?
- My mom.
Hi. I believe you have
something of mine.
About four-foot tall,
brown hair,
talks like she's 64 years old?
Hey. Hi!
- Hi!
- Hi!
So, what do you think?
- It's a good one.
- Yeah?
- Did Santa Claus come by yet?
- Nope.
Is it Tony Falacchi again?
- No, Tony had to leave.
- Bombed?
- Yes.
- It's the pressure.
[Dorey] But you know what?
I got this new guy,
and he really looks
like the real thing.
Maybe he is.
Are you still coming to dinner?
- Am I still invited?
- Yes.
Then I'm coming.
Honey, would you run home
and put the camera stuff away?
I'll put the stuff away.
You keep watching.
Okay.
Let her finish watching the parade.
Come on.
Santa hasn't even come by yet.
Well, as soon as Santa does
come by, I would like for you
to come home, all right?
Sure. That's the end
of the parade anyway.
There's nothing else to see
except guys cleaning up horse poop.
And that doesn't thrill me at all.
Hello!
Merry Christmas!
[Man on phone]
Hello?
- Jack?
- Yes, sir.
I've been watching the parade.
It looks bigger than last year.
- What is the crowd estimate?
- Well, sir,
cops say over a million.
Last year it was about 750.
Have marketing come up with a giveaway,
something free.
I don't want a crowd outside
Cole's in the morning.
I hate to say this,
Mr. Landbergh,
but Cole's has got one hell
of a Santa Claus this year.
If I didn't know better,
I'd say he was the real article.
Keep an eye on this,
Mr. Duff.
These small, seemingly insignificant
sentimental anachronisms...
can be surprisingly potent.
I don't want my plans damaged
by an elderly cherub in a red suit.
I'm on it, sir.
Bye-bye!
There we go.
[Dorey, Susan] Ooh! Aah!
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Thanksgiving.
You know, this is kind of like TV.
Except I'd need a brother and a dog.
And Bryan would be the dad.
- Mr. Bedford.
- He said I could call him Bryan.
- Only if it's okay with your mom.
- It's fine.
Bryan would be the dad,
you'd be the mom, and we'd need...
either a kind of
fat person who's our cook,
or a neighbor who's always
at our house.
You know,
that's not very interesting.
- Why don't we talk about something else?
- For the chef.
In the loosest sense of the word.
In every sense of the word.
The vegetables are catered.
So was dessert.
- Thank you, Susan.
- You're welcome.
Do we give blessings
in this house?
Not unless my grandparents are here.
Would you mind if I did?
It's kind of a tradition with me.
Oh. Fine.
We give thanks
for the food before us...
and the closeness
of the people we love.
We pray that these gifts
we so gratefully receive...
will be shared with those less fortunate...
than ourselves.
- Amen.
- Amen.
All right. Let's eat.
I slaved all day.
They really outdid themselves.
You have a very nice name.
One of my elves is married
to a fellow called Daniel.
- Do you know what you want for Christmas?
- Yup.
I want a Peter Polliwog
Patrol Frog that swims and blows up.
- Gosh, that sounds great.
- [Woman] Psst.
Psst. Can Mother have a word
with Santa, please?
Yes, of course.
Just a minute.
Don't make me look bad.
Them things cost 70 bucks.
He just looked at them.
I tell you what. Shopper's Express
have got them on sale...
at $34.99.
With a five dollar rebate,
that's reasonable enough, isn't it?
Yeah. Thanks.
But let me ask you a question.
Since when is Cole's sending
customers someplace else?
Oh, I don't think it matters
where the toys are sold...
as long as it makes
the children happy.
I'm sure the people in this store
believe exactly the same as I do.
Yeah... Yeah, that's the spirit.
Thanks, Santa.
- Merry Christmas to you.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
Now then, young man,
if you’re a very good boy...
and do exactly
what your mommy tells you,
you're going to have
a Peter Polliwog for Christmas.
- Bye, Santa.
- Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Daniel.
Merry Christmas.
Come on, then.
Come on. Right.
Up here on my-
That's it, on my knee. Now, then.
You the boss?
I'm general manager of the store.
My kid just asked Santa
for a barf gun, and the Santa
said he'd get it for him.
I hope the boy likes it.
They're over there by the elevator.
And they're 90 bucks
without batteries or barf.
- Prices do go up.
- Apparently not at Bargain Village.
- $52.50, and they throw in the batteries.
- I find it hard to believe...
Cole's could be undersold
by that much.
- Yeah.
- Where'd you get your information from?
From your Santa Claus.
We don't have them,
but if you go out of here,
turn to the right
and then two blocks down-
Excuse me?
Your Santa's telling
everybody where to go shop.
If you don't got it
or it's too expensive here,
he's sending people...
to where they can get it,
and at the right price.
You're serious?
Absolutely.
Madam, would you excuse me
for a moment?
You tell your Santa Claus that he
made a Cole's shopper out of me.
I'm coming here for everything
but toilet paper and bananas.
Any store that puts the parent
ahead of the almighty buck
at Christmas...
deserves my business,
and you can tell Mr. Cole
that his Santa Claus...
ought to get a raise.
You want me to go with you
to the chairman...
and pitch an idea that
you got from Santa Claus?
If Cole's doesn't have
what you're looking for,
we'll find it for you, even if it
means sending you somewhere else.
How does that sound?
It sounds like a great way
to go out of business.
You know that house in the country
where we do the catalog shoot?
- You wanted to buy it.
- Yes.
If this works, we're probably
looking at a bonus.
- And if he hates the idea?
- We're no worse off.
If we don't turn this store around,
we're all out, from the chairman
to the janitor.
Let's do it.
I... like it.
It's bold, it's fresh,
it will drive
Victor Landbergh nuts.
♪ It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas ♪
♪ Soon the bells

♪ And the thing that will

♪ Is the carol that you sing ♪
♪ Right within your heart ♪
♪ It's beginning to look

Why? Why didn't you
think of this?
Now, if this campaign is successful
and I know in my gut it will be,
Cole's is gonna make
a lot of money.
Now, the more money they make,
the harder it is going to be...
for me to buy them out.
Now, I want something
done about this.
When I call your name,
it'll be your turn to talk to Santa.
Just a few more minutes,
and you'll get to see Santa Claus too.
Okay, go ahead.
This seems like a pretty
pointless exercise, Bryan.
I know, but I just thought
as long as we were here,
we might as well stop by
and say hello to the old guy.
Look at him.
Why?
Let’s just say for the sake
of argument that there is
a Santa Claus...
and that you
don't believe in him.
Is it worth the risk that you
might not get anything
for Christmas this year?
Well, I didn't believe in him
last year, and I still got...
everything I asked my mother for.
Yeah.
You get a free candy cane?
I'm trying to limit
my intake of sugar.
Uh-huh.
[Woman] You can go see Santa now.
Okay, come on.
Go ahead.
[Santa] Nice to meet you.
[Child] Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, darlin'.
- Hello, sir.
- Oh, how do you do?
Would you like to come
and sit on my knee?
Good. Up we go. There we are.
Now then, what's your name?
Susan Elizabeth Walker.
What's yours?
Mine?
Well, I have lots of names.
Uh, Kriss Kringle,
Santa Claus, Father Christmas,
St. Nicholas.
If you were in Holland,
I’d be Sinterklaas.
Or in Italy, la Befana.
I have to speak many languages,
because, of course,
I travel, as you know,
a great deal.
That's Russian.
That's Swahili.
My mother's Mrs. Walker. She's
director of special events for Cole's.
- Uh-huh.
- She runs the parade.
- Oh.
- I know how this all works.
You're an employee of Cole's.
That is true.
But you're a very good
Santa Claus.
Thank you.
Your beard's stuck on real tight.
Usually the store Santa Claus
whiskers are too loose.
Right.
But yours look realistic.
Because they are real.
You give them a tug.
Whoo!
- Are you convinced?
- Mm-hmm.
[Kriss] Good.
This isn't the regular Santa suit, is it?
Oh, no. This is
the real Santa suit.
It's very nice.
I agree. It's lovely.
Gold buttons, gold thread.
It's as real as me.
Well, you ask your daddy
if I'm real.
- I don't know where he is.
- Well, he's, uh—
That's my friend,
Mr. Bedford.
I don't have a dad anymore.
Oh.
Well, now, what can I
get you for Christmas?
- Nothing, thank you.
- Nothing?
My mother buys my gifts.
If I don't want something too stupid...
or dangerous or-
Hi, Mom.
Good morning, Mrs. Walker.
It's nice to see you again.
Thank you, thank you.
Susan, I think you've taken enough
of this man's time.
There's a very long line of customers,
and they do come first.
Nice to meet you, Susan.
Nice to meet you too.
Bye-bye.
Nonbelievers.
Right.
If I felt that it was
important for her
to see Santa Claus,
I would be
more than happy
to take her.
I didn't see any harm in her saying
hello to an interesting old man.
Well, there is harm.
I tell her...
that there is
no Santa Claus.
Mm-hmm.
So you bring her down here
and she sees...
thousands of gullible kids,
and she meets an actor-
a very good actor, mind you-
with a real beard
and a beautiful Santa suit,
sitting smack dab in the center
of a child's fantasy world.
So, who does she believe?
The myth...
or the mom?
Listen, I just got
some mistletoe.
Why don't we go back
to my place and try it out?
No, I don't think so.
Okay.
I'm here. I can help.
All you have to do is ask.
Well, actually,
there is one thing.
Would you mind
taking Susan home?
Sure.
The reason I haven't
been to see you is...
I'm working at Cole's.
All I have to do
is to be myself.
There you are.
That's it.
There you go.
There you go.
- [Man] Excuse me.
- Oh?
Good evening.
Good evening.
My name is Jack Duff.
How do you do?
Very well, thank you.
This is Alberta Leonard.
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.
Nice to meet you both.
I'm Kriss Kringle.
Well, Mr. Kringle,
we're with Shopper's Express,
the department store.
Oh, yes. You've got
the Peter Polliwog on sale.
Right.
Yes, we do.
We want you to be
our main Santa Claus.
We have over
7,000 stores worldwide,
but you would be
the number one guy.
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you,
but the people at Cole's
have already hired me.
In fact, I've signed a contract.
If you would excuse me,
it is getting a bit late.
- Could we give you a ride?
- That's very kind of you, but I can walk.
- I mean, it's probably out of your way.
- Where are you going?
114th Street.
The Mount Carmel Senior Center.
- We're going right by it.
- It's on our way.
Well, thank you so much.
Uh, bye-bye, Prancer.
Bye-bye, Dancer.
So, tell me, Santa,
how does one guy...
get to every house
around the world in one night?
Ah, yes.
Well, now, that is...
a vexing question,
isn't it?
But you see, if you could
slow time down...
so that a second
became a year, a minute
became a century...
and an hour
became a millennium,
well, you could manage it
quite easily, couldn't you?
Mind you, I remember before-
Well, 100 years ago before
the population explosion,
I could manage to deliver
all my goods and have
enough time left over...
for a late supper, a nap...
and a round of golf
with the Easter Bunny.
He winters
in New Zealand, you know.
[Kriss] Thank you both
very much indeed.
And Merry Christmas to you,
Miss Leonard.
Merry, merry Christmas to you,
Mr. Duff.
- Same to you, sir.
- Thank you very much.
Good night.
He's completely
out of his mind.
Imagine Cole's having a guy
as nutty as that.
He could become
a problem for them.
I know what you mean.
[Duff] The Easter Bunny.
Nice to meet you.
Good-bye now.
- You don't think he's nuts, do you?
- Hmm?
Well, he believes he's Santa Claus.
Absolutely believes it.
Maybe that's why he's good at it.
What difference does it make?
Have you looked at our stocks?
They're through the roof.
Sales are up 70 percent
over last holiday.
In a week, this company
has turned around.
And we could go the other way just
as fast if this guy does anything wrong.
- What's he gonna do?
- We don't know.
If the fate of the entire
company rests on one
very unstable old man,
I think you're celebrating our return
just a little too soon.
I'm not worried.
Hello, little one.
How are you?
- Come. Well.
- She's deaf.
You don't have to talk to her.
She just wanted to see you.
Thank you.
You are a very...
beautiful young lady.
What's your name?
Sammy.
That's a beautiful name.
Now, I tell you what.
Do you know
"Jingle Bells"?
♪Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way ♪
♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪
♪ On a one-horse open sleigh ♪♪
Very good.
Darling, what would you
like for Christmas?
A doll and a bear?
Well, you shall have them,
Sammy.
I wish you
a merry Christmas.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
What are you doing
out of bed?
Something's driving me crazy,
and I can't sleep.
- Well, what's on your mind?
- Santa Claus.
Mr. Kringle?
Why? What about him?
He talked sign language
with a kid today.
Oh. That was
considerate of him.
It's weird how he knows
so much about toys and kids.
He speaks Russian
and Swahili.
Well, he must be quite
a learned man.
He looks exactly like every
picture of Santa Claus I ever saw.
Yes, I know.
That's why I chose him.
You're positive he's not
the real Santa Claus?
I thought that we
talked about this.
You understand what he is.
What if we we're wrong?
That would be extremely rude.
Well, we're not wrong, sweetheart.
But all my friends
believe in Santa Claus.
Well, most children your age do.
How come I don't?
Because you know the truth,
and truth is one of the most
important things in the world—
to know the truth and always
be truthful with others,
and more importantly,
with yourself.
And believing in myths
and fantasies...
just makes you... unhappy.
Did you believe in Santa Claus
when you were my age?
- Yes.
- Were you unhappy?
Well, when all the things
that I believed in...
turned out not to be true,
yes, I was unhappy.
Would it be okay if I
thought about this some more?
Do I have to not believe
in Santa Claus right away?
Come here.
You have the right to believe...
whatever you want
to believe.
Now, I've told you the truth,
but if I am wrong,
I would be glad to admit it.
I'll tell you what.
You ask Mr. Kringle...
for something that you
would never ask me for,
and if on Christmas morning
you don't get it,
you will know once and for all
the honest truth about Santa Claus.
That's a very clever idea.
Thank you. Now, you think
you can get some sleep?
- Yep.
- Yeah? Give me a kiss.
Good night.
I love you.
- I love you. Good night.
- Good night.

Barkeep!
Reload on this!
Hey! Hey!
Can I get another beer?
Boy, that Cole's,
they dealt me the high hard one.
I did a good job
for them last year,
and this year,
they gave me the—
the royal fist.
So, they just
gave you the shaft.
They didn't have any grounds
on which to dismiss you.
That broad that runs
the parade every year-
one of these college kids with a three
ounce brain and 50 tons of attitude-
she hires some wacko...
right off the street
to take my place.
Some wacko?
Tell me about him.
The old man?
He's a loon.
I mean, we got thousands
of 'em in this city.
I'll say.
Never had one of them
take my job, though.
Hey, Tony, did you have any
contact with this old guy?
Contact?
The guy came up on the float
and got right up in my face.
- So, he got aggressive with you?
- He had a cane.
He tried to whack me
over the head with the cane.
He tried to whack you
with a cane?
Isn't that what
I just said?
Tony, this'll
make you feel better.
I've got a little job
I want you to do for me.
Uh—
What, uh-
What kind of job
you have in mind?
You'll see.
Just be yourself.
Don't even think about the camera.
You'll be just fine.
Right. I must confess
I don't quite know...
why they're making
such a fuss about me.
Well, this is the holiday season,
and you're Santa Claus, right?
To many, yes, but to others I'm just
an old man with a white beard.
Yes, but you're still
the symbol of the season.
You think I'm a fraud,
don't you?
I think fraud is a bit
too strong of a word.
But you don't believe in me.
I believe that Christmas
is for children.
Well, your daughter
doesn't believe in me either.
I don't think that there's any
harm in not believing in a figure...
that many do acknowledge
to be a fiction.
Oh, but there is.
I'm not just a whimsical
figure who, uh,
wears a charming suit and
affects a jolly demeanor.
You know, I-I-
I'm a symbol.
I'm a symbol
of the human ability
to be able to...
suppress the selfish
and hateful tendencies...
that rule the major part
of our lives.
If you can't believe,
if you can't accept
anything... on faith,
then you're doomed for a life
dominated by doubt.
I like you very much,
Mrs. Walker.
You're a fine woman.
And you know,
I think you'll make
an excellent test case for me-
you and your daughter.
If I could make you believe,
then there'd be
some hope for me.
If I can't,
well, I'm finished.
Shall we go?
Five, four, three,
two, one.
I'm Kriss Kringle, and I'm
at Cole's department store
in New York City.
Good morning, America.
No, Mr. Kringle's time
is extremely limited.
Sorry. Mr. Bedford's
on line three.
No, he can't
do private sessions.
Can you hold
for just a moment?
Yeah, hang on.
Hi, Bryan. I have
the mayor's office on hold.
What's up?
If I can arrange a really,
really good baby-sitter
for tonight,
do you wanna do some shopping
and have dinner?
Well, I-I'm not sure
what I'm-
I don't know if I
can get Celia tonight.
I'll take care of it.
- I'll see you at 7:00?
- Well, I-I-I'm not sure what-
Okay, fine.
7:00. Bye.
[Kriss] Whoa, back.
[Bryan] Who is this one now?
This is Dancer.
He's a bit slow.
Not very good with his food.
Poor old Dancer.
Oh. Good evening,
Mrs. Walker.
Good evening,
Mr. Kringle.
Nobody at school's gonna
believe this one, huh?
Well, if you have to
have a baby-sitter,
who's better qualified?
Yes.
Yeah.

a Merry Little Christmas"]
Pretty, isn't it?
There really has to be something
you want for Christmas.
I'm very good at keeping secrets,
you know.
Come on, tell me.
Oh. What's this?
Gosh.
That's what I want
for Christmas—
a house, a brother
and a dad.
That's all I ever want.
- Oh.
- If you’re really Santa Claus,
you can get it for me.
If you can't, you're just
a nice man with a white beard
like my mother says.
Oh, Susan. Just because
every child doesn't get
his or her wish...
doesn't mean
there's not a Santa Claus.
I thought you might
say that.
Did you? Yes.
Well, a house is
a very big order.
And very expensive.
And a baby—
Well, a baby takes, uh,
almost a year to, uh-
Nine months.
More if the lady's late.
Less if the baby's a preemie.
Right.
And a father-
I mean, no one can give
anybody a father.
If Santa Claus really can
make reindeer fly and go
up and down people's chimneys...
and make millions of toys and
go all around the world in one night,
he could get somebody a house
and a brother...
and a dad, right?
Right. Right, yes.
I suppose he- he could.
I don't think I'll everget those
things so it's no big deal.
Oh.
Well, um, perhaps I could
keep this paper, could I?
- Sure.
- Well, good night, little angel.
Good night.
- Good night, Susan.
- Good night, Mr. Kringle.
A family for Christmas.
I don't think so.
No, really.
I mean-
See, that wasn't so bad, huh?
I had a great time.
You need to get out.
That's what your problem is.
You need to forget work,
forget all those things that you
have to do and come out with me.
But you understand
why I didn't.
Sometimes I think I do,
sometimes I think I don't.
Well, you are a very patient man.
Most guys are gone after
a few months of me.
Oh, so you admit
that you're rough on men.
No, I'm not just rough on men.
Yeah, I admit it.
I'm careful.
At this point in my life,
I really don't need
to be disappointed.
Do you want one of your
Christmas presents early?
I got you a present,
and I want to give it to you.
- What is it?
- Do you want it early?
Well, yes.
What is it?
Open it.
It's an engagement ring.
If I've given you...
a false impression
of this relationship,
I'm very sorry.
Are you serious?
Have I ever given you any sign...
that I wanted to marry you?
- No.
- Then tell me,
what ever possessed you
to make such a presumption?
You know, I've done everything
I could to try to make you happy.
I love your daughter
like she's my own,
I loved you,
getting nothing in return,
never asking
for anything in return.
I put my faith in you.
Well, if that’s true,
then you're a fool.
- Good evening. Taxi, please.
- Certainly.
- Mr. Bedford.
- Kriss.
- How was your night as a babysitter?
- Oh, very pleasant.
- Yeah, Susan's a good kid.
- Yes.
Delightful, delightful.
Well, how was it?
- I gave her an engagement ring.
- Oh. Oh.
She didn't like it very much.
Well, perhaps your timing
wasn't particularly good.
No. Not at all.
She's- She's, um,
a sad sort of person.
It's a pity, really.
I mean, she's very kind.
But she's terribly careful
about her emotions.
What I know about Dorey
is pieced together...
from fragments
of a dozen conversations.
She was married in college,
he had a drinking problem,
and right after Susan was born,
he took off and hasn't
been heard of since.
- Hmm.
- She's filled with these—
these bitter thoughts, and-
The worst part about it
is that she's dragging
Susan into this with her.
Yes. Well, Susan
is struggling with it.
But I get the feeling
she really does want to
believe in me, you know?
She's a good girl.
She's loyal to her mother's wishes.
I can't fault that.
But of course,
if I can't convince the mother,
I have no hope
of convincing the child.
Tooth Fairy told me that.
Well, your cab's here, Kriss.
Oh.
I always wondered what guys who
have to return engagement rings...
say to the sales clerk
at the jewelry store.
Now I don't wanna know.
I'm sure in your line of work you can
find some lucky guy to give this to.
It's very generous
of you, but I-
I don't think this ring
will ever fit anyone
other than Mrs. Walker.
I'm sure you'll find somebody.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I'll get over it.
And Susan?
Well, I know what you
want for Christmas now.
- I'll see what I can do.
- Good night.
Good night.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
[Woman] Come on. It's your turn
to go up now. Go ahead.
Hello.
- What do you want for Christmas?
- A bike.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you please step aside?
This is for the children.
Hot little helper
you got here, huh, Santa?
She the one that puts
the, uh, twinkle in your eye?
Hey, kids,
you see that guy
up there?
He's not really Santa Claus.
He doesn't even live at the North Pole.
He lives in a nursing home
on 114th street.
You know what he is?
He's a big, fat fake!
Yeah. Just a fake.
Ho, ho, ho.
Hey! Goofball!
- Huh?
- Yeah, you, numb nuts.
What is a guy your age
playing this game for, huh?
I mean, are you just a lonely,
pathetic mental case?
Or does it go a little bit
deeper than that?
Is there a darker side to this?
Tell me something,
you sorry old cripple, you.
You got a thing
for the little ones, huh?
Huh? Huh?
'Cause they ain't much good for
nothin' else, are they? Huh?
[Duff] Stop that man!
Quickly!
Get the cane away from him.
I-I didn't intend
to injure him.
He baited me.
He provoked me.
- Save it for the cops, sir.
- He's badly hurt.
Wait a second. You're—
You're Cole's Santa Claus!
Cole's Santa Claus?
[Kriss] He said the most terrible—
[Officer] Clear the way, folks, please.
[Officer #2] All right, folks.
Show's over.
- Please, step back.
- [Man] Take it easy, Officer.
[Woman Over TV]
You might want to clear
the kids out of the room...
before we read
this next story.
It appears that New York's
most famous Santa Claus
has a mean streak.
The centerpiece of
C.F. Cole's big holiday ad push
is behind bars this morning.
[Woman #2 Over TV]
...plans regarding a
replacement for Mr. Kringle.
The spokesperson did say,
however, that for at least
the remainder of today,
there will be no Santa Claus
at the 34th Street store.
[Man Over TV]
...without any apparent provocation,
struck him repeatedly
with a walking stick.
Police arrived within moments
and arrested Kringle.
[Woman #3 Over TV]
Planning to take your children
to the store today, take note.
There will be no Santa Claus
at the 34th Street store.
C.F. Cole's competitors
are having the last laugh
this morning.
[Kriss' Voice] I'm not just a whimsical
figure who wears a charming suit...
and affects a jolly demeanor,
you know.
I'm a symbol. I'm a symbol
of the human ability...
to suppress the selfish
and hateful tendencies...
that rule the major part
of our lives.
And if you can't
accept anything on faith,
then you're doomed to a life
dominated by doubt.
Get me Bryan Bedford
on the phone.
Bryan?
I know.
I saw the papers.
I want you to help him.
He's at Bellevue, and I
don't know what's happening.
But he's alone,
and he shouldn't be.
What's Cole's position?
Do the attorneys have an opinion?
This isn't about Cole's.
This is about a man...
who has had something
very wrong done to him.
Somebody you care about.
Somebody... you believe in.
Come in.
Your Honor, do you have
a moment for Ed Collins?
Send him in.
Thanks.
How are you, Eddie?
What can I do for you?
- How are you?
- Fine.
Oh, just the ah... commitment papers
for Cole's Santa.
Oh, boy,
that's a shocker, huh?
- The press is having a field day.
- "Age unknown."
- Old man, is he?
- Very old, Your Honor.
Am I going to have
to read all this?
No, it's a slam dunk.
The guy's out of his mind.
We'd like it over quick.
- "We"?
- Victor.
- "Victor"?
- Landbergh.
- Oh, yes.
- There.
Well, justice will have
to prevail, of course.
Oh, of course.
Yes, justice will have to prevail.
As always.
Money makes the world
go around, Eddie.
Yes, it does, Your Honor.
It sure does.
By the way, Mr. Landbergh
wanted me to tell you...
that he's very well aware
of your, uh, reelection campaign
coming up this spring.
Tell him I would welcome
his support.
Will do.
Come in.
- A Mr. Bedford's here to see you.
- Who?
He represents Mr. Kringle.
Send him in.
Your Honor, there seems to be
some undue haste in this case.
I wish to protect my client's rights,
as I'm sure you do.
- Mr. Prosecutor, this is, uh-
- Bryan Bedford.
Ed Collins.
If Your Honor pleases,
I request a formal hearing
where I may bring witnesses.
You can sign
the commitment papers
now if you like,
but I'll bring in
habeas corpus this afternoon.
We'll have a hearing.
Thursday morning,
9:00 a.m.?
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Collins.
Mr. Bedford.
I though you said the old man
didn't have an attorney.
What difference does it make?
It's gonna be a hearing, not a jury trial.
You're the only one
that has to be convinced.
Have a good day, Judge.
Wanna know something,
mister?
I don't believe it.
This guy ain't dangerous.
He may be off his rails
a little bit, but he ain't no thug.
And if he wants
to call himself Santa Claus,
then God bless him.
Hello, Kriss.
Hello, Mr. Bedford.
What brings you out
on a miserable day like this?
A friend in need.
You failed your mental exam
on purpose, didn't you?
Why would I...
do a thing like that?
I don't know.
Maybe you've served people
long enough.
- Maybe you've given all you have to give.
- No.
Then why did you do it?
The charges against you were dropped.
The man you hit
suffered no injury.
You could've been out of here
if you’d passed your exam.
I disgraced myself.
I read your transcript, Kriss.
You defended your honor.
You stood up for the dignity
of every child.
That isn't a disgrace.
That's decency.
If I'm dismissed
as a crazy old man,
then the good name
of Santa Claus is spared.
That isn't true.
If not for you,
there is no Santa Claus.
You are him.
Crazy or not, here or gone,
you're Santa Claus.
Only if the children
believe that.
And what kind of Santa Claus
were they believing in anyway?
They can't
look to me anymore.
Not after knowing what
happened the other night.
Well, think about
the other night.
A man was there
to photograph the incident?
The man you hit
was the man you replaced?
The cops told me this, Kriss.
The cops believe in you.
A lot of people do.
More will when we're finished.
- Finished with what?
- We're going to court.
There's a hearing Thursday
to decide if you’re
to be committed.
I'm going to defend you.
Together, we're gonna prove
that there is a Santa Claus...
and that you're him.
I'm ready, Counselor.
Now, we have a few days
to distance ourselves...
from this scandal
and restart our advertising.
Uh, Mrs. Walker,
we are in conference.
I have just read
your press release.
You are all such
a bunch of cowards!
You really don't deserve
to run the store.
You are entirely
out of line, Mrs. Walker.
We have spent millions telling people
that we are the store that cares.
Well, what is it
that we care about?
Profits? Ourselves?
Our jobs?
What about one of our own
who needs us now?
Well, what am I to do?
The public perception of Kriss is that
he's out of his mind, he's dangerous.
We have to change that.
If we stand with Kriss,
if we challenge the rumors
and the scandal sheets,
if we force the truth,
we'll win.
He's going into court with...
the best attorney in the city,
and he's going to prove
that Kriss is not crazy.
For the sake
of the whole company,
I think that all of you
should decide...
about whether or not you...
believe in Santa Claus.
Bring up two. Go.
For the last 75 years,
Cole's has invited Santa Claus...
to meet and greet
the children of New York City
in our 34th Street store.
Cole's believes in Santa Claus,
and we will stand by him.
He has done nothing but serve
the children and the families
of New York City...
and the world.
We invite you to join with us and ask
ourself this one simple question:
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

- How ya doin'?
- I have to confess, I'm a bit uneasy.
You'll be fine. All you have
to do is tell the truth.
Who's that character
in the gray suit?
- That's the prosecutor.
- Oh.
Anything I should know
about him?
Yeah. He doesn't
believe in Santa Claus.
- Ah.
- [Man] All rise.
Oyez, oyez. Let all those
who have business before
this court come forward.
The honorable Justice Harper presiding.
Draw near and ye shall be heard.
You may sit.
Your Honor, in the matter
of Kriss Kringle,
the commitment papers
are on your desk.
With Your Honor's permission,
I'd like to call the first witness.
Mr. Kringle, would you
please take the stand?
It's okay.
Good morning, Judge.
How's that grandson of yours?
The parade.
He thought I looked
like Santa Claus.
O-Oh- Oh, yes.
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?
Yes. Don't I put
my hand on a Bible?
No, sir, you don't.
Oh. Well, then, I'll put
my hand over my heart instead.
I do. I do!
[Bailiff] Sit down, please.
What is your name?
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't introduce myself.
I do beg your pardon.
You're Mr. Collins.
I'm Mr. Kringle. Kriss Kringle.
Order.
- Kriss Kringle.
- Yes, double "K."
Tell me, Mr. Kringle,
do you believe that
you are Santa Claus?
Well, would I be here
if I didn't?
Just yes or no, Mr. Kringle.
Do you believe that
you are Santa Claus?
Yes, of course.
[Collins] Santa Claus.
Hmm.
State rests, Your Honor.
Mr. Bedford, do you wish
to cross-examine the witness?
No further questions,
Your Honor.
- You may step down, Mr. Kringle.
- Oh, thank you.
Mr. Bedford, in view
of your client's statement,
do you still wish
to put in a defense?
Yes, Your Honor.
I should like to call
my first witness.
Can you tell us your name?
My name is Daniel Lowry.
And what'd you get
for Christmas last year, Daniel?
Um, a bike, and, um-
- And who gave you the bike?
- Him.
- [Bryan] What's his name?
- Santa Claus.
- Are you sure he's Santa Claus?
- Yep.
- How can you be sure?
- 'Cause he looks like Santa Claus.
Any other reasons?
- Um, he's very nice,
- Mm-hmm.
and he works at Cole's,
and he's got elves.
Tell me something, Daniel.
Could that man be Santa Claus?
- [Daniel] Nope.
- Why not?
Because Santa don't got
a grumpy face.
Order.
No further questions.
Mr. Collins, do you wish
to cross-examine the witness?
No, Your Honor.
No questions.
Do I have to go to jail now?
No. You can go
back to your seat.
Your Honor, I should like
to call my next witness.
Mrs. Rebecca Collins.
Order.
[Bailiff] Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?
- [Mrs. Collins] I do.
- Sit down, please.
- Do you have children, Mrs. Collins?
- I have two.
- How old are they?
- Four and seven.
- Do they believe in Santa Claus?
- I object, Your Honor.
On what grounds,
Mr. Collins?
As the court knows,
the witness is my wife.
Mr. Bedford is deliberately
harassing her solely in order
to embarrass me...
and expose private matters
to the court.
Your Honor, I'm merely
attempting to establish that Mr. Collins,
like so many others,
has taught his children
that there is a Santa Claus.
Objection overruled.
- You may continue.
- Thank you, Your Honor.
Mrs. Collins, do your children
believe in Santa Claus?
- Yes.
- Did they come to this belief naturally,
or were they introduced to it
by a family member?
Um, it was
a family member.
- Yourself?
- Yes.
And your husband?
Yes.
Your husband told
your children that
there is a Santa Claus?
Yes.
On more than one occasion?
[Mrs. Collins] Um, yeah.
Mrs. Collins, have you
taken your children to see...
a department store Santa Claus
this year?
- Yes, we have.
- Where?
- At Cole's.
- So your children have met Mr. Kringle?
Oh, yes.
- [Bryan] And they accepted him as Santa Claus?
- Yes.
Did the question of Mr. Kringle's
authenticity arise at any time...
before or after
your children met him?
Uh, yes, it was after.
[Bryan] And did you deny or confirm...
that Mr. Kringle
is the real Santa Claus?
You're under oath now,
Mrs. Collins.
Um, well, actually, my— my husband confirmed
that he's the real Santa Claus.
- No further questions, Your Honor.
- Thank you, Mrs. Collins.
- Merry Christmas.
- [Judge] Mr. Collins,
do you wish to cross-examine...
your wife?
I object. This is irrelevant
and immaterial, to say nothing
of being absolutely ridiculous.
Mr. Bedford is making
a mockery of this court.
He has not even established that there
is such a person as Santa Claus.
I would ask Mr. Collins
if he could offer any proof
that there is no Santa Claus.
Your Honor, I'd like
a recess until tomorrow...
so that I might
adequately prepare to meet
Mr. Bedford's challenge.
- Mr. Bedford, do you have any objections?
- No, Your Honor.
This court stands in recess
until 9:00 tomorrow morning.
He bought it.
I knew if I got him angry enough
he'd take the offensive.
There's no way in a court of law
we can prove that Santa Claus
exists or that you're him.
Haven't you given Mr. Collins
the opportunity of proving
that I don't exist?
Exactly. You see,
he'll go too far.
Our best defense is to let
Collins hang himself.
- Oh. Oh, I see.
- But you have to promise me one thing:
- You'll speak only when I tell you to.
- Oh, you have my word.
Good. Come on.
Hi. I, uh-
I just wanted to thank you for
everything that you're doing for Kriss.
I was in the gallery.
I don't know if you saw me.
- I still have a long way to go.
- I think you'll do it.
- I hope you will.
- I have a few tricks up my sleeve.
Um, about... last week.
I'm sorry.
I mean it.
I'm really, really sorry.
I was... just-
Scared?
Yes.
Well, no permanent damage.
- Well, I—
- Uh, yeah, I have to go.
- I have to pick Susan up from school.
- How's she doing?
She's good. She's good.
I think she... misses you.
Tell her I said hello.
Well-
Indeed there was.
St. Nicholas, otherwise
known as Santa Claus,
was a fourth century bishop
in Myra Lycia, Asia Minor.
Dr. Hunter, what is
the Church's position
on St. Nicholas?
He's a recognized saint.
[Collins] But isn't it true that in 1969
Pope Paul VI...
eliminated the official celebration
of the Feast Day of St. Nicholas?
That's correct. It was made
an optional memorial day.
They downgraded it.
In essence,
the Church walked away
from St. Nicholas.
Now, doesn't it also
stand to reason that they would
walk away from the derivative,
diluted secular figure
of Santa Claus?
[Dr. Hunter] I presume so.
Thank you, Dr. Hunter.
But the Church has not
made it clear what its pos-
No further questions.
[Bryan] It's all right, Kriss.
He's just trying
to get under your skin.
Colonel, have you ever
been to the North Pole?
Yes, sir. In 1972
and again in 1984.
- Did you explore the region?
- Extensively.
Did you ever find any evidence
of dwellings, animal pens,
barns, workshops?
- No, sir.
- [Collins] No evidence whatsoever?
- None, sir.
- Tell me something, Colonel.
In your opinion, would it
be possible for an individual,
like Mr. Kringle over there,
to create a settlement
in that inhospitable region
large enough to manufacture...
at least one toy for each
and every one of the Earth's
1 .7 billion children?
No, sir.
But there isn't any way in which
the gentleman can have seen
my workshops. They're invisible.
[Bryan] Kriss, sit down.
But— But Mr. Collins
is completely mistaken.
My workshops don't exist
in the physical world.
They're in the dream world.
Let me be the lawyer.
I always thought that was
completely understood.
Your Honor,
with the court's permission,
I'd like to call
my next witness.
- Mr. Collins, what is this?
- This... is a reindeer, Your Honor.
[Judge] I know that, but what's
it doing in my courtroom?
I'd like the court to see
Mr. Kringle make the reindeer fly.
He's baiting you.
He wants you to lose your temper.
He wants you to act crazy.
Remember that.
Mr. Kringle, we're waiting.
Well, hello.
Well, I would greatly
like to oblige, Mr. Collins,
but I cannot make
this reindeer fly.
I didn't think so.
He only flies on Christmas Eve.
Yes, of course, Mr. Kringle.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Well, in that case, would
somebody please remove the wit-
the animal from the courtroom?
Your Honor,
the state of New York
has absolutely no desire...
in laying waste
to a popular myth.
But this case
is not about mythology.
It's about the mental competency
of a man- that man, Kriss Kringle.
Now, everyone
in this courtroom,
if they were entirely honest
with themselves,
would have to conclude,
based on the evidence,
that Mr. Kringle,
regrettably, is insane.
Now, as a sworn guardian of the
laws of the state of New York,
as a citizen and as a father,
it is my wish that Mr. Kringle,
who masquerades as Santa Claus,
a figure of benevolence
and generosity,
but who does so solely for profit-
That's not true!
Your Honor-
Mr. Kringle will refrain
from comment, or he will
be removed from the courtroom.
Sit down.
Sit down, Kriss.
Your Honor, I was not aware
that Cole's department store
was a charitable institution.
If it is, I'm more than willing
to apologize to the court
and to Mr. Kringle.
I didn't think so, Your Honor.
As I was saying before I was
so rudely interrupted,
it is my wish, Your Honor,
that Mr. Kringle be placed
under the care of the state...
so that the children
of New York...
will no longer be put at risk.
Hey, you big jerk!
Mr. Kringle's the nicest man in the world!
He'd never hurt anybody!
[Judge] Order! Order!
- Sit down.
- Order!
Order!
I have nothing further
to say, Your Honor.
Kriss, sit down.
We're almost through.
It's okay.
Mr. Bedford, do you wish
to make a closing statement?
Your Honor, a lot of people
believe in Mr. Kringle,
including millions of children.
If you rule against him,
you won't destroy anyone's belief,
but you will destroy
the man they believe in.
Mr. Kringle
is not concerned for himself.
If he was,
he wouldn't be here.
He is in this
regrettable position...
because he is willing to
sacrifice himself for children,
to create in their minds
a world far better than
the one we've made for them.
If this is,
as Mr. Collins suggests,
a masquerade,
then Mr. Kringle is eager
to forfeit his freedom...
to preserve that masquerade,
to subject himself
to prosecution,
to protect the childrens'
right to believe.
If this court finds that Mr. Kringle
is not who he says he is,
that there is no Santa Claus,
then I would ask the court
to judge which is worse:
a lie that draws a smile...
or a truth...
that draws a tear.
I rest my case.
I shall render my opinion on this
matter at 12:00 noon tomorrow.
Until that time,
this court stands in recess.
- Counselor.
- Hello, Judge.
I appreciate you waiting for me.
Sit down.
How did I get on this case?
I don't wanna rule
against your client,
but I can't see how,
given the facts,
I can do otherwise.
A man who believes himself
to be someone he isn't is,
by definition, disturbed.
He isn't dangerous.
He isn't a threat.
I can't sit up on that bench
as a representative
of the state of New York...
and declare that
there is a Santa Claus.
I can't make that argument,
as much as I'd like to.
Believe me, Mr. Bedford,
if I had a way out of this,
I'd take it.
I'm sorry.
It's all about money,
isn't it?
You know what destroyed
Kriss Kringle?
Power, greed and this.
Anger and recrimination
may soothe your soul,
but it won't help Mr. Kringle.
He doesn't need a bitter
epilogue from his attorney.
He needs a miracle.
[Bailiff] All rise.
You may sit.
Having heard the evidence
in the matter of Kriss Kringle,
I, Judge Henry Harper,
a representative
of the state of New York,
must regrettably rule on this day,
the 24th of December,
in the year-
Would it please the court
if I gave you a Christmas card?
I probably won't get
another chance to see you...
unless I get arrested,
which is very unlikely,
since it's Christmas Eve
and I'm going to bed
uncharacteristically early.
Uh-
- Thank you very much, young lady.
- You're entirely welcome.
And, uh, merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.
What were you doing?
Merry Christmas.
I'm not gonna be
needing that.
The young lady who just
approached the bench...
presented me with this
Christmas card and this.
It's a one-dollar bill.
It's gonna be returned
to her shortly.
But by presenting me
with this bill,
she reminded me of the fact
that it's issued by the Treasury
of the United States of America,
and it's backed
by the government
and the people...
of the United States of America.
Upon inspection of the article,
you will see the words
"In God We Trust."
Now, we're not here
to prove that God exists,
but we are here to prove that
a being just as invisible...
and yet just as present... exists.
The federal government
puts its trust in God.
It does so on faith
and faith alone.
It's the will of the people
that guides the government.
And it is and was
their collective faith
in a greater being...
that gave and gives cause
to the inscription on this bill.
If the government
of the United States
can issue its currency...
bearing a declaration of trust
in God without demanding
physical evidence...
of the existence
or the nonexistence
of a greater being,
then the state of New York,
by a similar demonstration
of the collective faith of its people,
can accept and acknowledge
that Santa Claus does exist,
and he exists in the person
of Kriss Kringle!
Case dismissed.
Case dismissed!
Santa Claus wins!
All charges have been dropped.
Kriss Kringle is free.
- Hey! How about that?
- Yes!
You're right, Kriss.
It's all about the children.
Congratulations, Counselor.
Thank you.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Kringle.
- Merry Christmas to you, Mr. Collins.
Thank you.
Uh, my children...
wanted me to remind you...
not to forget to stop by
the house tonight.
- Oh, I won't forget. I promise.
- We live in Stamford.
3133 Brompton Road.
Big white house.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I know it well.
Yeah, well—
Anyway, merry Christmas.
Oh, uh, Mr. Collins,
I hope you've taken down
that old television antenna.
I ripped my pants on it last year.
Pardon me, folks.
Pardon me.
Well, Kriss, you're free.
You made a believer
out of everybody.
Oh, not everybody.
There's still a few
I have to convince.
One in particular.
Excuse me.
- Way to go, Bryan!
- I'm so happy for you.
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Walker.
- You did a great job, sweetie.
- You kicked that guys's bottom.
- Well, she saved the day.
- Well—
Congratulations, Bryan.
Thank you, Dorey.
Have a merry Christmas.
You too.
Well, I'll let you go.
Merry Christmas.
- And good luck.
- Merry Christmas, Mrs. Walker.
And a merry Christmas
to you, young lady,
and thank you very much.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Kringle.
Merry Christmas, Bryan.
Excuse me.
[Kriss] Again, thank you so much.
I shall never forget you.
And in all my travels past...
and all my travels
yet to come,
I'll never find
a better friend.
Thank you, Kriss.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you, Bryan.
Hey, you wanna
share a cab home?
Home? Not tonight.
I'm going to be somewhat busy.
That's right.
This is gonna blow up
in my face, isn't it?
I lost bigger than
I ever thought I'd win.
There was a lot of pressure, sir.
I mean, who knew
what the judge was gonna do...
when he was faced with having
to put Santa Claus in the nuthouse?
He isn't Santa Claus.
What the hell is the matter
with everybody?
There is no Santa Claus!
Is somebody getting married?
- Not that I know of.
- Oh.
Did you arrange this?
No. You did.
- Oh- I did?
- You didn't?
- I didn't. Did you?
- I didn't.
- You did. I know you did.
- Oh, no.
- [Dorey] Yes, you did. You did, didn't you?
- No, no.
I did not. Father?
Are you ready?
For what?
To get married.
Oh, my gosh!
I have something
to tell you.
What'd you get for Christmas?
I don't care what you
asked Mr. Kringle for.
Susan, that is not why
we are going to the house.
We're going to
the catalog house, right?
That's the house
I told him I wanted.
I showed him a picture of it,
and he took it,
and he said he would
get it for me.
- Well, a house is a pretty big gift.
- That's what Mr. Kringle said.
Honey, we are going to the
house because it snowed,
and it's very pretty,
and because Mr. Shellhammer
wants to take photographs...
for next year's Christmas catalog,
which, I think,
is awfully bold of him.
- It is a holiday.
- That’s just an excuse.
Mr. Kringle did all this.
I'm very sorry, Mother.
You have it perfectly wrong.
I knew it!
- Well, where is everybody?
- You got a bonus.
- What do you mean?
- Our name's on the mailbox.
I got a call last night
from Mr. Kringle who said...
you and your husband
were looking for a house.
He was quite insistent.
Did you get married?
- Yeah, last night.
- I can't believe it.
Congratulations.
Was this planned?
- Uh, no.
- I can't believe it!
Mr. Kringle wanted to be here,
but, uh, he's overseas.
Mr. Kringle.
[Shellhammer] Oh, the house is for sale,
fully furnished,
and I'm sure you
can afford it now.
Oh, we all get our bonuses
thanks to you and, uh, Mr. Kringle.
Wow!
I knew it.
Oh, thank you, Donald.
I don't know what to say except...
merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas. Oh.
Chin-chin.
This is the house I asked Kriss for,
and he got it for me.
And he got me a dad.
And the third thing—
I guess I'll just
have to wait for.
But he'll get it for me,
won't he?
If Kriss said he'd get you something,
I bet it's already on the way.
I guess there's no doubt about it.
He's real.
I'm going up to look at
my new room. Excuse me.
- Susan?
- What?
What else did you ask
Mr. Kringle for?
A baby brother.
See ya.
