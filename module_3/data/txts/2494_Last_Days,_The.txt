Your turn.
Marc.
Marc!
Stop, damn it!
Marc!
Marc, you'll get us all killed!
Marc!
Marc!
We finally made it!
Next.
Next.
That's it?
That's all there is.
Unbelievable.
Where are you going?
Vila Olimpica.
- And you?
- Verdaguer.
To find my girlfriend.
That's a GPS, right?
Excuse me?
What's in your bag.
It's the GPS that got stolen
downstairs.
- Shut up and we'll talk.
- Okay.
Listen.
Look at him.
The Terminator.
Son of a bitch.
He came from the future
to fuck us all up the ass.
Marc Delgado.
I'm sure you know why I'm here.
Yes, we all do.
What do they call me?
The butcher?
Or something worse?
Marc Delgado.
I see you're in charge
of the security protocol.
The project leader
says you're behind schedule.
Well, we've been having
some problems with...
I'm not a programmer,
spare me the details.
All I know is without the protocol
we can't test the project.
If you were...
a programmer, I mean...
you'd know it's a complicated
process.
If we rush it the firewall will have
more holes than Swiss cheese.
And we'll spend years
patching it up.
Haste makes waste.
Look, Delgado.
If I'm here, it's because
someone's not doing his job.
When things go well,
they don't call me.
So listen carefully.
If you get fired,
it's not going to be my fault.
- It should be ready this month.
- Should be... or will be?
Will be.
Fuck!
Hi.
<i>Hi, sweetie.
We 're about to close.</i>
<i>- How's it going?
- I'm gonna be here a while.</i>
Go get a drink with Andrea.
No, I'll see you at home.
Andrea always keeps me out
all night.
You guys are a bore!
You're worse than my parents.
<i>See you at home for dinner, okay?</i>
<i>Marc?</i>
Help... me...
Every morning
I send a boyfriend to work...
And this is what you get back.
Look. Do you like it?
- It's terrifying.
- I might not sell this one.
I think I'd rather keep it.
Julia...
Not for now.
For when we decide to.
Or when you do.
It's not about me deciding to.
It's the timing.
We have a kid now and then what?
That bastard from Human Resources
is breathing down my neck.
Who knows if I'll be able
to pay the rent?
Bastards...
Should I heat something up
for you?
<i>Meanwhile more than a dozen airports
remain closed due to volcanic ash</i>
<i>from Mount Hekla.</i>
<i>It's the third eruption this year</i>
<i>and the ashes have reached
Southern Europe.</i>
<i>And now shocking footage
from Canada</i>
<i>where 16-year-old Greg Lafferty
took his own life last Saturday</i>
<i>after spending more than 6 months
shut in his house.</i>
<i>His parents found his body...</i>
Oh, my God.
I've seen it 4 times
and it still gives me the chills.
Maybe it's like
those Japanese kids.
The ones who stay home all day
playing video games...
But that's in Japan.
There are fucked-up kids
everywhere.
- Rovira, watch it.
- Sorry.
He's wearing the same suit again?
When was the last time
he changed?
When was the last time he showered?
- Did you see the Japanese kid?
- What?
What do you want?
I told you.
To find my girlfriend.
And?
I need a GPS
to navigate down there.
Any cell phone has GPS.
They all use cell phone towers
which don't work anymore.
But the satellites still do.
At least for now.
But you already know that.
Or you wouldn't have stolen it.
Stolen it?
Do you want to go out there
and ask the others what they think?
Again: What do you want?
You can't go anywhere
without a flashlight.
Maybe in the subway tunnels,
but when you reach the sewers
you won't see a thing.
Take me to Julia and it's all yours.
You can go to Vila Olimpica
or wherever you want.
Where did you get all this?
Rovira.
Keep it, I'm not interested.
Okay, we'll just ask
the others then.
You're a piece of shit.
We've been shut in here
for three fucking months.
I don't know if she's dead or alive.
I'm a piece of shit?
I don't care.
So make up your mind.
Yes or no?
Shut the door.
Good luck.
We'll see each other again.
Definitely.
Definitely.
How's the reception?
There's a lot of interference.
It's faint, but it's there.
- Maybe if we go deeper...
- Hands off.
Turn it off at least.
You're wasting battery.
We won't need it
until we reach the sewers.
Line 3 takes us to Sants,
then we switch to line 5
straight to Verdaguer.
Line 4 takes you to Vila Olimpica.
Let's go.
Fuck.
Give me the bottle back!
That's my water!
Give it back!
The GPS!
Hey, you!
- Move!
- Run!
Move!
Javi!
- What are you doing?
- Hands off, damn it!
What the fuck is going on?
That son of a bitch...
Who, him?
This son of a bitch is my brother.
What does that make me?
Another son of a bitch, right?
<i>No, no.</i>
Look, we don't want any trouble.
Really.
The kid stole our bag.
Okay?
We just want it back.
And we'll go.
Right.
Or else...?
Or else what?
You'll find a cop?
Shit.
Don't worry, kid.
You think this is still worth
anything?
The only thing that still means
something...
is this.
On your knees.
- Okay, okay.
- Let me go.
Javi.
Does it work?
Very smart.
What have you got in there?
I asked you a question.
- Grab the GPS when I say.
- What are you gonna do?
I said... what have you got...
in there?
- Just grab the GPS.
- But...
Marc?
Marc!
Yes!
Have you got it?
Yes.
Are you ready?
Ready for what?
Run!
Move!
Move!
What the fuck happened?
Does it work?
What happened?
I didn't see anything.
- Did you kill him?
- Does it work?
Please...
Can I have it back?
This is when you ditch me, right?
You and I made a deal.
And we don't need
any more enemies.
What?
<i>Good morning, it's 7 A.M.,
six in the Canary ls/ands.</i>
<i>I'm Manuel Quintero sitting in for
Pedro Lamas who has been ill.</i>
<i>He's the third one this week,</i>
<i>including Emma and Julian.</i>
<i>We wish them a/l a quick recovery.
Here are today's headlines.</i>
Hello?
What the fuck are you doing here?
I knocked but you didn't answer.
I thought something
had happened to you.
What do you care?
- What do I care?
- What's my name?
- Well?
- I don't know.
You have no fucking clue.
You never even say hello to me.
And now you come into my home?
How long have you been in here?
What are you talking about?
When was the last time
you went outside?
Months ago...
Every day I try to leave the building
but I can't.
You haven't talked to anyone?
What do I tell them?
That I'm afraid to go outside?
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
You have no right to do this to me!
- Okay.
- Please, just...
- Please...
- Let's go.
Let go of me!
What's going on?
Rovira. The first to go.
- Already?
- Wait.
You forgot this.
But that's not the best part.
They found food hidden
in a cabinet.
The nutjob had been sleeping here
for weeks.
- Here?
- Here, in the office.
The guy never went home.
Hold still, damn it! Let's go!
I can't go outside! No, no!
Please, <i>no...</i>
Please, <i>no...</i>
- Let's go.
- No, no!
Help! Help!
Please, don't...
Let go. Come on, let go.
Let go!
Let go!
Come on, damn it!
What's wrong with him?
Wait!
Put him down.
We need an ambulance.
We need an ambulance.
It's urgent.
There's a man...
it looks like he's having a seizure.
Take him inside.
What?
Grab his legs.
Grab his legs, damn it!
One, two, three!
Move!
Move, damn it!
He's dead.
How awful. It looks like the same
thing my sister told me about.
Marc?
Marc?
What's wrong?
Spying on the neighbors?
- Maybe.
- Why?
I don't know.
Have you noticed anything weird
at work?
Weird how?
Yeah...
Shops closed, people not showing up
for a while...
Well, one or two are closed, but...
that's normal for a shopping mall.
Why?
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
You're not sleeping.
- Yes, I am.
- Two hours isn't sleeping.
I sleep, it's not that.
Then what is it?
What?
Somebody died at work today.
Oh, my God.
Who?
Rovira.
Rovira... Do I know him?
I didn't either...
I only spoke to him a couple times.
He had a heart attack.
My love...
He died in my arms, Julia.
And he was terrified.
Something's happening.
Something's happening
and we're missing it.
Motherfucker...
Motherfucker!
A motherfucker
who keeps his word.
Waterproof.
Shall we?
- What's in Vila Olimpica?
- Excuse me?
Are you looking for someone?
Your wife?
Your girlfriend?
Oh, so it's a secret, sorry.
- You have a bunker with canned food?
- Look.
Once we get to your place,
we part ways.
Seeds.
A drain.
It should lead to the sewers.
Shit.
Okay?
We're close!
35, 36, 37...
".38, 39, 40."
Here.
We should be right under
my building.
What if I miss?
If you miss
we'll be stuck down here.
So we can't miss.
Ready?
Fuck!
Shit!
You Okay?
Yeah.
Can I try?
Hold your breath.
So your hand won't shake.
Marc... Last bullet.
Remember not to breathe...
Marc!
Marc! Are you okay?
Marc, answer me!
Marc, answer me.
Marc!
Can you hear me?
Are you okay?
You did it.
I don't know how, but you did it!
Jesus Christ.
Look at that.
What is it?
Who are you?
Open the door.
Open the door.
Open the door, motherfucker!
Open the door!
Julia!
Julia!
What did you do to Julia?
Where is she?
Put down the knife!
Stop! Stop!
Please, stop!
We had nowhere else to go.
We couldn't go outside
and the place was empty.
Is it yours?
Yeah.
Have you seen this girl?
House empty.
Are you sure? Look closely.
- House empty.
- Really.
We're going to look around.
No, it's okay.
Fuck...
Did you know?
<i>Two weeks after
the first death in Spain,</i>
<i>reports from countries like the U.S.,
Germany and Korea confirm</i>
<i>that the phenomenon
known as "The Panic" is global.</i>
<i>A man died this morning in Alicante
when he left his home in his car</i>
<i>proving that vehicles
offer no protection</i>
<i>from The Panic.</i>
<i>However, the government
has cal/ed for calm.</i>
<i>I assure you the government is
taking all the necessary measures.</i>
<i>We ask the public to keep working
and shopping.</i>
<i>To stay calm
and go about their lives.</i>
Calm?
He wants us to stay calm?
Can you believe this?
<i>“No sweat, everybody.“</i>
We still don't know.
Let's wait and see, right?
There's nothing to see.
Everything's perfect.
The world's falling apart
and we're looking the other way,
but everything's fine.
That's enough, Marc.
<i>More and more women can't go outside</i>
<i>and have had to give birth
in unsafe conditions...</i>
And these schmucks
are having babies. Unbelievable.
Only schmucks have babies now?
In a situation like this?
Yes, definitely.
But the world's been going to shit
for a while now
and that never stopped anyone.
Who would even do that?
Why did you wait until now
to tell me?
Tell you what?
Tell me what? Jesus, Marc.
You've been making excuses
for years.
When we get a bigger apartment,
when I get a raise...
- It's not that.
- Of course not.
You're terrified of having kids.
And you're not?
Have you looked out the window
lately?
How long were you going
to string me along?
Until I dropped the subject?
Or until I couldn't anymore?
Julia...
Julia, please.
Don't listen to me.
Come out and let's talk.
Julia.
Julia.
Damn it!
Fine, I'm leaving.
Keep working and shopping,
everything's fine.
<i>The scientific community remains
unable to find the cause...</i>
<i>Still awaiting the new report
from the WHO,</i>
<i>health officials
continue to follow</i>
<i>basic prevention guidelines
for contagious diseases.</i>
<i>They all show classic symptoms
of a panic attack.</i>
<i>- Panic to what?
- Going outside.</i>
<i>We 're talking about agoraphobia,
the victims of the Panic</i>
<i>develop an irrational fear
of open spaces.</i>
<i>The sudden spread of the disease
after Mount Hekla's eruption</i>
<i>might indicate that the agoraphobia</i>
<i>is the result of a virus released
from an unknown geological stratum.</i>
<i>We're dealing with a case
of mass hysteria.</i>
<i>How else can we explain
the disease</i>
<i>striking complete/y at random?</i>
<i>no pattern to the epidemic
has been found.</i>
<i>Severe allergies to dust,
pollution, hairspray...</i>
<i>Are you suggesting people
are becoming allergic to the world?</i>
<i>We are clear/y facing
a biological agent</i>
<i>spread by the ash cloud...</i>
They're fucking clueless!
They're making it up
as they go along.
Sure they know. They're just lying
through their teeth.
They already have a vaccine,
but not enough for everyone.
The king, the Pope
and their mothers come first.
Jesus, you need to stop listening
to cab drivers.
This is a hoax.
<i>Yes.</i>
Hey...
I'm sorry, okay?
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Marc, it's me, Andrea.
<i>Andrea? Where's Julia?</i>
<i>- Is something wrong with her?</i>
- No, she's fine.
But she can't talk right now.
Can't or won't?
<i>Come on, Marc.</i>
Please, put her on.
Don't make this harder for her.
Look, this is between me and her,
okay? Put her on.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Why the fuck are you meddling?
<i>- Jesus, Marc...
- Look.</i>
I'm coming over there, okay?
Tell her I want to talk to her
in person.
<i>Don't be stubborn.
Give her some space.</i>
Please, just stay there.
All right?
Tell her I'm on my way.
I need her to listen to me.
Andrea?
Damn it!
<i>I'm talking about hypersensitivity.</i>
<i>About a lifestyle so aseptic...</i>
<i>that it's left us
without natural defenses.</i>
Marc!
Come on, come on!
Ready?
That way, I think.
To go where?
Julia must be at the mall.
In her shop.
No.
We have a deal.
The deal was to go to Verdaguer.
Now we're going to Vila Olimpica.
No. She wasn't there.
That's your problem.
We're not gonna search all Barcelona
until we find her.
You go ahead.
But without the GPS and flashlight.
Listen to me.
- Will you listen to me?
- Don't make me.
Don't make me
because I'll do it.
She's pregnant.
We're having a baby.
If she hasn't already lost it.
If she's still alive.
Son of a bitch!
Shit!
Here!
Your fucking flashlight!
I have a girlfriend.
A baby!
What the fuck have you got?
My father!
He had a stroke three months ago
and he can barely move.
He's a patient
at Del Mar Hospital.
I took you to your place,
that was the deal.
Now it's my turn.
You're gonna stay here
with the rats?
Let's find a flashlight,
go to the hospital
and then the GPS is all yours.
This way.
Will we see anything with that?
No, but we will with torches.
The priest liked
more than just altar wine.
Hungry, huh?
Come on!
Now what?
Throw away the torch.
- What?
- Throw it away!
Marc!
Marc?
Thanks.
For what?
For before.
For not leaving.
I needed the GPS.
Right.
It's my job to know
when people are lying.
I never lied to you.
The protocol was going to be ready.
It doesn't matter.
Someone had to go.
You were gonna fire me?
Bastard!
Last year they sent me to Madrid.
An energy management company.
Over-staffed, the usual.
The head of Human Resources
wasn't answering my emails.
I asked for his office
and when I opened the door...
I found him dead.
- Sudden heart attack.
- Damn.
- He'd been lying there for 4 days.
- You're kidding.
He was divorced. People at work
thought he was at home.
And nobody was waiting for him
at home.
And I thought...
When my dad's gone,
the same will happen to me.
Nobody will notice.
What did your dad do?
My dad?
My dad can hardly read,
he can barely write...
He came to the city
without a penny to his name...
and worked his whole life
so that I could go to school.
But I can say...
he's got everything he needs now,
I see to that.
Well,
I used to.
It was a way to...
My dad and I aren't big talkers.
We're both very macho.
The last time I saw him
we talked politics, soccer...
So many damn things
we never talked about...
The last time I talked to Julia...
I told her I didn't want children.
Don't laugh, asshole.
Congratulations, kid.
You win.
I can't compete with that.
It's not that.
Of course I want children with her.
I was scared.
Scared?
Yeah, I don't know...
That I'd screw up.
That I couldn't protect him.
If I was scared before,
what about now?
How the hell
am I going to protect him?
You think this is the end?
Don't you?
Who knows...
When the radio was still working
they said they'd found tribes
in Australia immune to The Panic.
Nomads.
With boomerangs and loincloths.
In the end,
they'll rule the fucking world.
Maybe they know something we don't.
We may still have time to learn.
For 25 pesetas,
name possible causes of The Panic.
For example, Mount Hekla.
One, two, three, answer again.
Mount Hekla.
Cell phone radiation.
Bacteriological weapons.
Aliens.
- Aliens?
- Sure.
Why not?
I just want a light.
We have cigarettes but no light
and you obviously do.
Where are you coming from?
Verdaguer.
How is it?
We've seen worse.
- Avoid Sants Station if you can.
- Thanks.
Where are you going?
To Clinico Hospital.
My sister needs a doctor.
Have you tried Del Mar Hospital?
It's nearby.
- We're headed there.
- What for?
My father's a patient.
What's wrong?
What did she say?
What rumor?
What the fuck happened?
Enrique.
What happened to my dad?
There was a fire.
They say the hospital burned down.
But it's just a rumor, right?
They haven't seen anything.
Enrique!
Enrique!
Enrique!
Enrique!
My God.
Enrique, please!
Stop!
We don't know what happened.
He might have gotten out.
From the fifth floor?
Hooked to an IV?
What's left?
Keep crawling through the sewers?
There's nothing left, Marc.
This was over a long time ago.
We were just fooling ourselves.
Maybe.
But we need to keep
fooling ourselves.
I have people waiting for me.
I don't.
That's not true.
I got this far thanks to you.
Stop it.
I don't need your pity.
- Let go of me!
- Listen to me!
- Listen to me!
- Let me go!
Listen to me.
I still need you.
You're almost there.
You don't need me at all.
What are you doing?
Take them.
I have no use for them now.
No, damn it.
For your child.
He'll need them much more than I do.
What will you do?
It doesn't matter.
You took me all the way here
and that was the deal, right?
Get out of here.
Don't waste any more time.
Get the hell out.
I'm the bastard
who was going to fire you.
Julia!
Where are you?
Where are you?
<i>"Mom, we can't leave.
We're at the supermarket. Andrea.</i> "
Didn't you get enough
the other day?
Go back to your floor.
I'm not from another floor.
I came from outside,
from the sewers.
I don't care if you dug
all the way here. Go away.
We have no food for you.
I don't want your food.
I'm looking for a girl.
Don't come any closer.
- Her name's Julia.
- I said stop.
Freeze!
I have a photograph.
She's not here.
I'd tell you to check upstairs,
but...
they're less understanding
up there.
Are you sure?
She'd look different.
She'd have longer hair.
And a swollen belly.
She's pregnant.
There's a pregnant girl.
It could be her.
Go check.
They're checking inside
to see if she's here.
Thank you.
Hello?
It's a trap! It's a trap!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Marc?
Marc!
Julia!
Andrea! Where's Julia?
Ls she with you?
No, I'm sorry.
Have you heard from my mother?
Quickly. We have to go.
- What's happening?
- The people upstairs are hungry.
Shit!
Wait.
I haven't seen her since that day
you called and the phones died.
- Where did she go?
- To the doctor.
- The doctor?
- Gynecologist.
You're having a baby.
Let's go!
Come on.
Huff!!-
Andrea!
Andrea!
Get out of there!
Go outside! Please!
You have to try!
Go outside!
No!
Enrique.
You were right, you still need me.
Where's Julia?
Via Layetana 54...
I hope.
Are you okay?
You sure?
I'm fine.
It's nothing, don't worry.
Let's go.
Before the building collapses.
What the hell happened here?
Someone broke through
to get to the sewers.
Are we close to Julia?
I don't know.
Let's go UP-
Hello?
Hello?
No fucking way.
What is it?
What's wrong?
Layetana 54.
That's where Julia is, right?
We made it.
The tunnel is blocked.
How the fuck will we get over there?
Where are you going?
To find Julia.
Julia... Julia!
Julia!
Julia! Julia!
Julia! Over here!
Julia! Julia!
My love!
I saw her, Enrique!
I saw her.
Enrique.
Let me see.
Okay.
Don't worry.
You'll be just fine.
- We need to stop the bleeding.
- Marc.
Press here.
Press hard.
I'll go get something to...
Marc.
Stop.
Forget it.
No.
No, don't do this to me.
I can stop it.
Enough.
There's no stopping this.
Listen carefully, because
this is what you're going to do.
You're going to stop whining,
you're going to walk out that door
and you're going to cross
that fucking street.
I don't know if I can.
Of course you can!
You have people waiting
on the other side.
This is not the end, Marc.
Not for you.
Hey. Stop that!
It's nothing to get worked up over.
It's better than having
a heart attack at home watching TV.
At least,
you're here
to notice.
Who would have thought
a year ago
that something interesting
would finally happen to us.
My love.
Push!
You're almost there. Push!
Enric!
Enric!
Come up.
