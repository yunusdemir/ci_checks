<i>It's called "stimming,"
self-stimulation.</i>
<i>Whereas you and I might tap our fingers,</i>
<i>grind our teeth, bite our nails,</i>
<i>your son rocks back and forth.</i>
It's more obvious, but perfectly natural.
We came here because
we heard you specialized in...
What is it? What does he have?
I'm not a fan of labels, ma'am.
<i>Your son is a remarkable young man.</i>
<i>Who goes crazy
when you turn the vacuum on.</i>
<i>He wears one T-shirt,
won't let you hug him.</i>
<i>Loud noises, bright lights</i>
can be especially difficult
for someone like your son.
The shirt, most likely fabric sensitivity.
<i>Hugging, closeness, touching...</i>
Justine, no shoes today.
<i>That can be a challenge, yes.</i>
<i>When it's somebody else's child,</i>
<i>it's a challenge.</i>
<i>When it's yours,</i>
it's a problem.
My practice focuses on education.
<i>I'd like to work with your son,
at his speed.</i>
Help him develop the skills
he'll need to lead a full life.
Communicating, eye contact,
<i>understanding non-verbal cues,</i>
<i>making friends.</i>
<i>The only friend
he has is his little brother.</i>
<i>I'm sure moving from base to base
hasn't helped.</i>
My husband's in the Army,
which means we all are.
Would you be willing to let your son
stay with us for the summer
free of charge, working with me
in a sensory-friendly environment?
That's not gonna happen.
If loud noises and bright lights
bother him,
he needs more of it, not less.
<i>The world is not
a sensory-friendly place,</i>
<i>and that's where
he needs to learn to live.</i>
<i>Not in here.</i>
Doctor, in your opinion,
can our son lead a normal life?
Define normal.
I need to finish! I need to finish!

<i>I made it myself.</i>
No, not particularly.
But do you ever sell them?

Mrs. Rice, you may have what the IRS
calls a "home-based business."
<i>What room do you use in your house

<i>How big is your dining room?</i>
Mrs. Rice's office.
I wouldn't
so much as call it an office...
<i>- Oh.</i>
It's, uh, approximately 200, uh...
Well, make it 300 square feet.
Excellent. Mrs. Rice...
<i>Dolores.</i>
Dolores, when you order supplies,
do you order online?
I don't. I just zip on over

You did the heavy lifting

I worked on it, yeah, but Agent Lorenz--
Why haven't you applied

You're already doing the work.

I'm quite sure you're not.
And you know this how?
I'm on the clock.
Shit.
I hope we're not wasting ours then.
Look, kidding aside, I think if you
saw our books, you'd run for the hills.
We have an incredibly complicated
accounting system.
Depreciation schedules
on hundreds of different items.
Full-time and contract employees.
Department of Defense classified accounts.
It's a numerical shitstorm.
I'll need to see all those books
for the past 10 years.
Bank statements, complete list
of clients and vendors.
Hard copies printed out, my eyes only.
All the information's right here.
Okay, well, well, look.

only last week.

it makes them feel
that you're just not interested

Or maybe you just think

That gun makes you a big man, does it?
This gun? Simon, come on.
I'm part of a small but potent department

We have a client, let's call it
a European manufacturing concern.
<i>You're shorting their stock,
but simultaneously,</i>
<i>you're spreading false rumors
regarding the health of the company.</i>
The resulting decline in the stock price,
it's made you your millions,
but it's been at my client's expense.
They have been forced
to cut hundreds of jobs, Simon.
These are third-generation metal workers,
people with families.
Pensions are being rendered worthless
because of you.
But you'll stop now. Correct?
Which company?
Wrong answer, Simon.
Look, genius--
That's the same spot, Simon.
Why you gonna let me hit you
in the same exact spot?
I only meant
we hold short positions
on dozens of companies.
<i>Shit, son.</i>
I suppose
you're spreading false information
about more than one company.
If that's what you're doing, you're just
gonna have to stop shorting them all.
That's ridiculous.
I can't be expected to--
Ooh, I know.
All right, get your chin up, Simon.
No pouting on my watch.
Yeah, you're a man. You just...
<i>You're a man in your own way.</i>

Hey, Sorkis, give me something.

<i>Then he strolls into

<i>and goes on a seven-man killing spree,</i>
<i>using their own weapons.</i>
Headshot, headshot, headshot.
<i>Sorkis, stop.</i>
<i>A den of stone-cold killers?
Where is this?</i>
The Ravenite. Headquarters
of the Gambino crime family.
<i>He killed Anthony "Little Tony" Bazzano.</i>
<i>Forensics lists cause of death

Your boy kicked him in the head once.

<i>What the fuck?</i>
<i>Wait! I gotta call it in!</i>
I've also got an audio file here.

<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Please.</i>
<i>That's Little Tony.</i>
<i>I'm fucking begging you.</i>
<i>I didn't touch him.

Okay.
<i>I like the balance of it.</i>

<i>Plus, my dad was an accountant.</i>
<i>He actually...</i>

You know, the little amortization book,
and the green eyeshade,
and the, like,
dorky pocket protector and...
I have a pocket protector.
That's a nice one.
I mean, his was dorky, that's...

Um, but he convinced me

You're making money.
But there's a leak.
And the leak is...
Leak, where's the leak? Here.
Slewitt Manufacturing.
I've signed these checks.
- Who authorized it?
- Ed.
Mr. Chilton. They make electronic
assemblies for the consumer division.
No, they don't. Look at this.

That's not even the best part, look.
The best part is, they're routing money
to a company that doesn't exist.
And yet, profits go up.
And they continue going up.
Absolutely makes no sense.
- Where's the money coming from?
- Exactly!
Um, it's not inventory?
Inventory turns. No.
- Chargebacks to vendors?
- No. Perfectly in order.
- Internal offsets?
- No. That's a terrible idea.
- Um...
Cummings, you're needed in

Sorry.
And?

<i>- Hey, Ed.</i>
- What the...
We're having lemon merengue pie.
Those two bottles of insulin.
<i>You know, I just thought</i>
that you would appreciate me
treating you like an adult, right?
So, here's what I got.
You administer your own accidental
insulin overdose, and just...
Die.
But do it with dignity.
Your wife, who's sleeping upstairs,
she'll be the beneficiary
of what's gotta be a very generous
insurance policy, am I right?
But the only way she's gonna
collect on that policy, Ed,
is if we have the appearance
of an accident.
If we lay our hands on you,
you're gonna fight, squeal.
She wakes up, my hands are tied.
One accidental death is just that,
but two, no.
I'll have no choice.
I'll have to rock and roll
a home invasion,
violate your wife a dozen different ways,
kill you both,
burn the place to the ground.
I'm sorry for that. Ed, Ed, Ed?
Hey, nobody's gonna
violate your wife, okay?
Aside from what that would say
about me as a human being,
physiologically it's a non-starter.
Sometimes I think I just say shit,
sample what comes out of my mouth.
I will, however,
park a .45 in her brainpan.
I honor my commitments.

probably find hard to grasp.
Make a decision, sir.
Where are you going? Sir?
Sir?
Stop that. Why are you doing that?
Stop that.
Sir? Sir? What are you doing? Excuse me?
Mr. Chilton passed away.
I was told to clean up the room.
What's happening?
Can you give us a minute, please?
This is the balance of your contract.

- Yes, I'm upset.

Yes, you have.
Ed was a diabetic for 30 years.

- No, no, come in, dear.
We're done.
<i>You're very good, Mr. Wolff.</i>
But I hope our paths never cross again.
I'm responsible
for the death of my best friend.
I'd prefer not to be reminded of it.
<i>Do you think that's true?</i>
That Mr. Chilton killed himself...
I mean, do you think we're responsible?
It's very hard for me to interpret
why people do what they do.
I'm not finished.
I'm not finished with this.

<i>Mom! Mom! Mom!</i>
<i>Why is Mom leaving?</i>
<i>Mom!</i>
<i>Again.</i>
Again.
Enough.
They're not done.
Tomorrow is another day.
They have done their best.
If that were true, you'd be covered
in blood and snot, not them.
<i>Keep going.</i>
Aggression, correctly channeled,
overcomes a lot of flaws.
Tapping into that aggression requires
peeling back several layers of yourself.
<i>It's my job to know my sons' limitations.</i>
Get up.
It's your job to peel.
Do your job. On your feet.
<i>Again!</i>
<i>We could have went to his house,
shot him in his home.</i>
And we'd be on a plane by now.
Or on a security camera,
or some nosy neighbor's iPhone.
Call the bookkeeper in.
He's just too far.
He won't hear--
Now.
Let's go. Get up. Come on.
Move!
Come on, come on, come on.
Christian!
<i>Chris!</i>
Again! Louder!
Up! Up!
- No, no! Please!
<i>- What the fuck?</i>
Dolores!
She's coming with me.
No, no, stop! Stop! Leave her--
We're all going together.
Pull that truck around back.
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's move!
Come on! Drive! Drive now!
- Jesus fucking Christ!
God damn it!
Son of a bitch!
What the fuck?
When I say the name of your employer,
you say "yes."
- Practice.
Yes.
Camorra.
Juárez.
Gambino.
Do you understand the rules?
My left pocket.
They paid to
<i>kill you both.</i>
That's all I know.
<i>Hello, dreamboat.
Dana's in danger.</i>
Kill Christian Wolff,
transfer all domestic accounts overseas.
<i>- Current vehicle?</i>
- F-150.
<i>- Virus to triple Z?</i>
- Wipe everything.
<i>Done. In the DOT database now.</i>
<i>Reassigning the license and VIN.</i>
<i>I have George Boole
or Charles Babbage in the queue.</i>
Boole. Obviously.
<i>Silly of me. What else?</i>
<i>She is not your problem.</i>
<i>Straight to the trailer,
hook it up, and disappear.</i>
<i>There's no time.</i>
<i>Only the trailer.</i>
Address and phone number. Get it.
<i>She's not answering.</i>
Could have used the small box.
Well, she looked bigger in the photo.
God!
God damn!
<i>Bitch!</i>
Fuck.
We should go.
Since when are accountants
difficult to ventilate?
Dead?
Christ! What'd he do, hit him
over the head with an adding machine?
Oh, God.
All right, just put me in touch
with the client.
<i>I'll handle this accountant myself.</i>
Running isn't an option for me.
I can't just walk out on my life!
We have to go to the police.
That's what normal, taxpaying people do!
Police can't protect you from someone
who can afford to return $61 million.
Return?
What are you talking about, "return"?
The money was being put back.
Stay here.
What are you doing in here?
- Who are you?
<i>- You can't...</i>
You should not be here.
<i>Sit down. Sit right there.</i>
What is this place?
PanAmerica, Airstream.
34 feet 7 inches long,
<i>8 feet 5 inches wide.</i>
Dimensions which are perfectly adequate
for one person.
Preferable, even.
This is where you live?
No, I don't live here.
This is a storage unit.
That would be weird.
That's what would be weird?
I'd like to spend more time here.
However, I'm afraid some of my clients
might follow me.
Why would your clients follow you?
You're an accountant!
How do you know what to do here?
Why are you prepared for this?
Plus, this is on wheels,
which means I can hook it up
and be gone in 12 minutes.
Usually.
Sarcasm? Is that sarcasm?
No, that's not sarcasm.
I don't use sarcasm. It's irritation.
Everything in the world that is
important to me is in this trailer.
And right now, changing my routine
for you is jeopardizing that.
Tell me that's not an original Pollock.
We should go.
Now.
- Medina.
<i>- Miss Medina?</i>
<i>This is Gordon Amundson
with the FBI Language Services.</i>
Uh, yeah. Any luck?
<i>It's an unusual audio file.</i>
<i>Solomon Grundy is a nursery rhyme
circa mid-1800s.</i>
<i>Your voice has four of
the six intonation patterns</i>
<i>we use to define American English.</i>
<i>That's difficult to confirm with a rhyme.</i>
<i>Out of curiosity,
was your subject a trauma victim?</i>
Um, why do you ask that?
<i>Well, you indicated on your submission</i>
<i>that this event occurred
in a high-stress environment?</i>
Yeah. Exceptionally.
<i>That's interesting.</i>
<i>The verse was repeated
a total of four and a half times</i>
<i>with zero variation in pitch, span, tempo,
volume, or articulatory precision.</i>
So, what does that mean, exactly?
<i>Well, we often see
this type of repetitive chanting</i>
<i>in children
who have been exposed to trauma</i>
<i>or persons with
neurodevelopmental disorders.</i>
Neurodevelopmental disorders?
<i>Fragile-X syndrome, autism.</i>
Okay, so...
Let's say I was looking at mugshots.
How would that present itself?
What exactly would I be looking for?
<i>Fragile-X: Elongated face,
protruding ears, poor muscle tone.</i>
<i>Autism's nearly impossible
to identify visually.</i>
<i>The traits are behavioral:</i>
<i>difficulty with
social interaction, communication,</i>
<i>lack of eye contact.</i>
<i>Lack of eye contact.</i>
Okay.
<i>Good luck to you.</i>
Thanks.
None of this makes sense.
Why go through the trouble of skimming
the money if you're gonna put it back?
Over the last two years,
the number of invoices submitted
by Slewitt Manufacturing declined.
Scared of getting caught?
Price hikes?
Prices of consumer electronics
go down, not up.
Right, down, yeah.
I can't afford this.
I know. My treat.
<i>In the US, 104 men,</i>
<i>last name any standard derivation
of your mathematician, Carl Gauss,</i>
<i>reported over $500,000
in any of the last seven years.</i>
<i>Okay. Go a million plus.</i>
Seventeen.
<i>Of the 17,
how many between the ages of 25 and 45?</i>
Four.
Of those four,
only one has an income stream
that's cash-heavy or easily laundered.
And he
died three years ago.
What's this?
It's names of
the 100 most famous mathematicians.
<i>Look, we know what we're doing now.</i>
So, just enter the names,
narrow down the search right off the bat.
Male, Caucasian,
<i>25 to 45, earning a million plus.</i>
No investment income.
He'll concentrate on cash.
What's in it for me?
Look, if you help me find him,
I'll see what I can do
about getting you outta here.
Please.
Single earner or filing jointly?
Hey, those paintings in your trailer...
- They're real, right?
- Yes.
You didn't buy them at auction, did you?
They're a form of payment.
Right.
Hey.
Thank you.
At my apartment.
Oh.
Yeah.
Can we sit down for a second?
Yeah. Okay.
Just...
Sit.
How do you, um,
know how to...
My father was an officer in the Army.
Psychological Operations.
He was concerned that I might be
taken advantage of somehow,
so he arranged for me to train
with a number of specialists
throughout my childhood.
We lived in 34 homes in 17 years.
- You moved 34 times?
- Mmm-hmm.
God. That's extraordinary.
No, I'm sure
it must've been difficult, but...
I haven't been anywhere.
Well, Cancun. Not my proudest moment.
Um...
I just mean...
Your life is unique.
It's not unique. I have
a high-functioning form of autism,
which means I have
an extremely narrow focus
and a hard time abandoning tasks
once I've taken them up.
I have difficulty socializing
with other people, even though
I want to.
When I was a senior in high school,
I wanted this special dress for prom.
I told myself that spending $100
on a trashy dress
that I was gonna wear one time
to an event that I thought was
silly in the first place, was...
- Wasteful.
- Yes.
But Vera Wang
made this black, strapless classic.
It was more expensive, but you could
wear it to all kinds of future events.
- It was an investment.
- Yes.
Where were you when I was in high school?
Oh, North Carolina, Israel.
Right. Um...
The problem was
they wanted $1700 for this dress,
and I didn't have that, so...
- You asked your parents?
- No.
Hang on.
Blackjack. I'd never played a hand,
but I went to the library, and I
checked out all these books on strategy.
And I turned the Naperville North
math club into a little Vegas.
- What's a math club?
- Math club?
You compete against other schools.
Theory and speed math.
Like, what's 298,567 times 92?
27,468,164.
Right. Um...
Blackjack.
I could tell you
when to hit, stand, split, re-split.
I moved on to card counting,
shuffle tracking, hole carding.
And I took everything I had,
which was $183,
and I drove down to Harrah's in Joliet.
Why was this dress so important to you?
It wasn't about the dress.
I just wanted to walk into the gym
and have everybody say "Wow!"
<i>I was trying to belong.</i>
I was trying to connect.
I think no matter how different we are,
we're all trying to do the same thing.
But I lost all but $20
in the first 10 minutes.
I fed that into a nickel slot
on the way out,
- and I won two grand.
- Hmm.
I used the extra cash to pay for a limo.
Only wore the dress the one time.
Chris, why are we here?
Um...
I thought this hotel
had good water pressure.
The Holiday Inn Express in Aurora
has good water pressure.
Yes, but these towels are very fancy,
and cheaper hotels have scratchy towels.
<i>And</i>
I wanted you to like it.
Crazy Eddie and the Panama Pump.
Crazy Eddie Antar and the Panama Pump.
Have you ever heard of...
<i>- What?</i>
- Crazy Eddie Antar.
He owned a string of electronic stores
in New York City in the '80s.
Crazy Eddie Antar, he started stealing
almost as soon as he opened business.
Okay, I'm not following.
<i>He deposited money in Tel Aviv,</i>
and then he cycled it through Panama
and put it back into his stores.
Okay, why take it out and put it back?
Well, initially he was just stealing
in garden-variety tax evasion,
but then he came up with a better idea.
You see, by taking his own money,
stealing it, and putting it back
on his books...
He was raining cash.
He took the company public at $8 a share.
A year later, it was trading at $75.
- Rita's taking Living Robotics public.
- Yes.
But why would she hire you
in the first place
if she thought you would figure it out?
I don't know.
I'll have to ask her.
<i>Whatever Rita's involvement,
it's not your concern.</i>
<i>You disappear, I make a call.</i>
<i>Please. I worry about you.</i>
If I don't do something, Dana will die.
<i>Risking your life for a girl
you've known a week.</i>
<i>Why?</i>
<i>Heavy sigh.</i>
<i>What's the plan?</i>
Find the person who wants to kill her.
<i>And?</i>
Shoot them in the head.
Last one.
Wolff, two "F"s, Christian.
Two hundred and forty five men.
Four with incomes over a million.
All over the age of 60. Sorry.
<i>Right.
Your guy's an accountant.</i>
Two Christian Wolffs own CPA firms.
The first Christian Wolff owns...
Wolff Accounting. 121 South Street,
Scottsdale, Arizona.
Income of 435 grand. It's a good year.
<i>So good, we audited him two years ago.</i>
<i>He's clean.</i>
The other Christian Wolff...
Nope. Only 75 grand.
ZZZ Accounting.
Wabash Way, Plainfield, Illinois.
ZZZ.
I mean, it's not exactly
a smart Yellow Pages move.
<i>Wait a second.</i>
Who filed the returns for
Kim's Nails, Wabash Way, Plainfield?
ZZZ Accounting.
Could just be the neighborly--
Great Mandarin, Wabash.
ZZZ Accounting.
Paul's Laundromat.
ZZZ Accounting.
Tell me they're all
registered as partnerships.
<i>Every one.</i>
<i>Managing partner...</i>
Christian Wolff.
- Christian Wolff.
- Come in.
Christian Wolff, last year, ran $75,543
through his accounting firm.
Whoa. Who is Christian Wolff?
The accountant.
- 75 grand? That's chump change.
- Agreed.
But he ran another $287,765
through Kim's Nails,
$445,112 through Great Mandarin Chinese,
and you'll love this,
$505,909 through Paul's Laundromat.
Paul's Laundromat?
Are you fucking kidding me?
He's playing with us.
He can't clean that kind of money
through an accounting firm.
The paper trail's too heavy.
So, he's laundering it
through cash businesses.
All of those are in the same strip mall
south of Chicago.
ZZZ?
I mean, he doesn't care about the traffic.
It's a front. All of it.
Christian Wolff, Carl Gauss,
Lou "Lewis" Carroll.
He's using the names
of famous mathematicians as a cover.
Charitable contributions here
to Harbor Neuroscience.
Last year alone,
that's gotta come to close to--
$1,000,100.
That one's not a cover.
That's the real deal. I checked.
So, you're telling me
this guy risks his life
doing forensic accounting for some
of the scariest people on the planet,
collects his fee, goes through
all the trouble of laundering it,
and then gives almost all of it away?
Well, what if
he's taking other means of payment?
Yeah, possible. Yeah.
I caught him, Ray.
Maybe.
Pack a bag. We're going to Chicago.
90% probability they're all right-handed.
Up to me, I'd snap four right wrists.
But maybe you enjoy waiting
on a schoolyard sucker punch.
Life is a series of choices,
none of which are new.
<i>The oldest is choosing to be a victim.</i>
Or choosing not to.
Second oldest: loyalty.
<i>Family first, good times or bad.</i>
<i>Bonjour</i>, fellas.
They're only glasses.
You think if you don't fight back,
then maybe they'll like you.
Stop picking on you, calling you "freak."
<i>Well, here's what it is.</i>
<i>They don't like you,
they don't dislike you.</i>
<i>They're afraid of you.</i>
You're different.
Sooner or later,
"different" scares people.
Victim or not? Make a decision.
Go.
<i>You're different.</i>
<i>Sooner or later,
"different" scares people.</i>
<i>In here.</i>
.357 Colt Python.
Serial number's gone.
Hydra-Shoks.
Wireless security cam.
Infrared, weatherproof.
<i>He's got a network of 'em.</i>
<i>Whole backyard's got eyes.</i>
This is our guy.
So, why does a guy who's
up to his elbows in cash live here?
Given his clientele, he figures
blending in will extend his shelf life.
It's the smart move.
Well, maybe not smart enough.
High-tech security cameras back here,
anybody could roll up in the front.
How does he cover this?
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
Don't see that every day.
<i>Boys, let's have a situation report.</i>
We good, Ike?
All clear.
<i>Rock and roll.</i>
And how about you, sport?
It's Bobby.
I got nothing.
<i>Okay, yeah, I'm getting a feed
on the camera now.</i>
<i>Move it to the left side.</i>
<i>Is all this really necessary?</i>
You should be watching his home.
<i>Yeah? What you think?</i>
That's your idea on the subject?
Love it when people tell me
how to do my job.
I believe I recommended
you leave the country.
- You declined.
- He's an accountant!
I could see it in his eyes.
The freak wasn't gonna let it go.
My best to Michelle.
I will.
I was old 10 years ago.
So, what's your story, Medina?
You know my story.
I know what the courts said.
Stuffed a handful of cocaine
up a drug dealer's nose,
pistol-whipped him
into the trunk of his car.
<i>I was 17. It was August.</i>
He cooked for three days, but lived.
Do you regret it?
The coke was half borax.
Same shit he kept selling my sister.
<i>She's a dental hygienist in Annapolis now.</i>
Married, three kids.
No, I don't regret it.
That's rough.
All due respect, Director King,
what the fuck do you know about "rough"?
<i>Wait! I gotta call it in!</i>
<i>Move it!</i>
<i>You tell me, Medina.</i>
<i>Men kill each other
for any number of reasons.</i>
<i>Bobby, you hear me?</i>
<i>Money, power...</i>
<i>Fear.</i>
<i>Right there, motherfucker!</i>
<i>Nine men would die
that day at the Ravenite,</i>
<i>but for none of those reasons.</i>
<i>No, they'd taken something
from the man who was killing them.</i>
<i>Something that couldn't
be made whole again.</i>
<i>Something very important to him.</i>
<i>And he was there for his pound of flesh.</i>
<i>Please.</i>
<i>Just fucking stop, man!</i>
<i>Just put the gun down!</i>
<i>Little Tony Bazzano.</i>
<i>I'd been wedged in a van for six months</i>
<i>listening to that arrogant little prick
belch, fart, and brag.</i>
<i>Please.</i>
<i>I'm fucking begging you.</i>
<i>I didn't recognize his voice
with all the fear in it.</i>
<i>I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!</i>
<i>I wasn't even--
<i>Our man had come for revenge.</i>
<i>And he got it.</i>
<i>Nine dead.</i>
<i>And I was 10.</i>
- Your name?
Ray.
Raymond King.
Who employs you, Raymond King?
I'm a Treasury agent.
Are you a good one?
No.
No, not particularly.
Is that it?
Kids, I got... I'm a dad.
I got two kids.
Grown?
Yeah.
Yes, yes, they're all...
They're all grown up.
Were you a good dad, Raymond King?
Yeah. I've been a good dad.
I'm a lousy agent,
and I've been a weak man,
but that I didn't screw up.
That I got right.
Imagine you're a Treasury agent
approaching the twilight
of a spectacularly dismal career.
<i>And then one day, that break
you should have been looking for.</i>
<i>Francis Silverberg, a black money legend.</i>
<i>Cleaned cash from Monte Carlo
to Havana to Vegas.</i>
<i>He cooked the books for the Gambino family
for 40-plus years.</i>
<i>Until one day, the boss, Big Tony Bazzano,</i>
<i>thought maybe the old man's age
made him vulnerable to prosecution.</i>
<i>Ordered his son, Little Tony,
to kill Francis.</i>
<i>Kid fucked it up.</i>
<i>Francis ran, became a federal informant
in return for protective custody.</i>
<i>Could have turned my career around</i>
<i>if only I'd listened.</i>
<i>I didn't.</i>
<i>He was processed out,
and he lost the only protection he had.</i>
<i>Stand clear of the gate.</i>
<i>The protection that he was promised
when he testified against Big Tony.</i>
<i>And this time, Little Tony got it right.</i>
<i>He had Francis in a couple hours.</i>
<i>Down in a filthy basement in the Bronx,
nailed to a chair,</i>
<i>tortured to death.</i>
<i>So, I volunteered for a joint task force.</i>
<i>Sat outside the Ravenite
in a surveillance van for months</i>
<i>hoping to get a shred of evidence
to use against Francis' killers.</i>
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>
I gotta call it in!
Move it!
<i>I went in there
hoping I could ease my guilt.</i>
<i>And I met our accountant.</i>
<i>Why he let me live, I didn't know.</i>
<i>But he changed my life.</i>
<i>Gave my notice at the Department.</i>
<i>I started looking forward
to the day again.</i>
<i>- You know, feeling the sun on my face.</i>
<i>Quit drinking.</i>
<i>Was on my way out the door...</i>
<i>And then, the phone rang.</i>
Ray King.
<i>I'll never forget that voice.</i>
<i>Do you like puzzles, Raymond King?</i>
She tells me she works for the accountant.
And that a shipping container
packed with Chinese nationals
is passing through the Port of New York.
Few months later,
one ton of uncut Juárez cartel product
is entering Miami.
All those cases you put together...
Smoke and mirrors.
So, who is he?
This accountant.
Prisoner 831.
Fort Leavenworth, maximum security.
Military prison?
So, he was in the Army?
<i>Army lent him to us to track
al-Qaeda money launderers.</i>
<i>He was transferred from Leavenworth
to our detention center in D.C.</i>
<i>Did the work of five men.</i>
<i>Data mining, cluster analysis.</i>
<i>He roomed with Francis.</i>
<i>They kept to themselves, played chess,</i>
<i>ate together, sat in the TV room together.</i>
<i>They were inseparable.</i>
<i>And then one day, a guard told Wolff</i>
<i>why Francis hadn't called or written
since he got out.</i>
<i>That his burnt body had been found
in a Staten Island landfill.</i>
<i>Wolff snapped, went after the guard.</i>
He fractured the man's skull
with a thermos.
Escaped from a third-floor window.
Took the thermos.
That's all you got? I mean, Leavenworth,
he'll have military records--
Records are all heavily redacted.
Well, then arrest records, something?
Spring of 2003, at a funeral home
in Kankakee, Illinois.
<i>Our boy sends six locals to the hospital
with a variety of injuries.</i>
<i>No one knew Wolff.</i>
<i>The older man who came with him
was identified as a colonel, US Army.</i>
A funeral home.
Whose wake?
One customer that day.
<i>Mrs. Lauren Alton.</i>
<i>Mrs. Alton taught first grade
for 13 years in Kankakee.</i>
<i>Survived by a husband
and two boys, ages 12 and 10.</i>
<i>By all accounts,
an ordinary life, well lived.</i>
<i>But cut short.</i>
It'll be all right.
<i>Excuse me, sir, this is</i>
family only.
Sir, I'm going to ask you
to step outside.
<i>And then a fight breaks out.
A brawl, really.</i>
<i>Over what,
the authorities never pinned down.</i>
Get your hands...
Deputies respond.
A Barney Fife-type squares off
with our boy, gets rattled, pulls his gun.
<i>The colonel just stepped in front of 831.</i>
<i>Army collects both men.</i>
<i>Police report names Wolff
as "Soldier One."</i>
<i>And widower
identified the colonel by name.</i>
<i>His late wife's former husband.</i>
<i>I checked. It's an alias.</i>
<i>No more real than "Christian Wolff."</i>
She was the dead colonel's ex-wife.
And you think Wolff is what to him?
<i>Were you a good dad, Ray King?</i>
I've given up trying to figure out
when I'll get a call.
The "why" though, that I've got.
Someone breaks his moral code.
Why are you telling me this?
I'm retiring in a few months.
When she calls,
somebody needs to be there to answer.
No.
He's a criminal, Ray.
Yeah.
He aids and abets drug cartels,
money launderers.
He's a fucking killer.
Believe me,
I wrestled with the same decision.
<i>But when I got that first call,</i>
I realized something.
I'd spent my whole life only recognizing
my lucky breaks after they were gone.
The Brit, who is she?
Hello?
<i>Miss Medina.</i>
<i>Tell Eliot Ness to get his feet
off the furniture.</i>
<i>He's not in a barn.</i>
<i>Living Robotics.</i>
<i>Write it down.</i>
North of six feet, short hair,
athletic build, yes?
Correct.
But when you say short hair,
you mean short hair like my hair,
or you mean short hair like--
What's the difference?
I was told you could fix this, so fix it!
But you did speak to the man, am I right?
You spoke to him?
<i>What did he sound like?</i>
I didn't make small talk.
What's it matter what he sounded--
That's Ike, right? That's the north side?
Yo, Bobby, was that you?
<i>Bob.</i>
<i>Bobby.</i>
<i>Ike, are you there?</i>
<i>Ike?</i>
<i>Guys, stop fucking around.
Someone answer me. Ike?</i>
Pull was to the left.
You might consider using a round
with a superior ballistic coefficient.
Give me the layout of the home.
Points of entry, corridors, rooms, cover.
Go.
Fuck.
- Sit down.
<i>- What's this--</i>
<i>Shut up. Sit down in the chair.</i>
You ever see a match-grade round traveling
3,000 feet per second go through a window?
Nobody does.
Get down, now!
Four men, front entrance.
Go right at him. Go now.
You...
<i>I got the cameras.</i>
Go join your friends.
Up.
<i>Clear.</i>
<i>Smoke.</i>
- Go, go!
<i>Go, go.</i>
Attack front entry!
Man down!
<i>- Guys, talk to me.</i>
<i>You got eyes on who it is?</i>
<i>Someone talk to me.
Let me know what the sitrep is.</i>
Are they dead?
<i>Give me a situation report.
How many down?</i>
Are they dead? Answer me!
<i>Okay, he's on the roof.
Start forming up. Let's move.</i>
<i>Check skylights, check windows.</i>
<i>That motherfucker comes in,</i>
<i>I wanna hear gunshots
and I wanna hear "target eliminated."</i>
That's enough. He's in the goddamn house.
Get out there and end this!
<i>Brax, give me a situation report.
Have you got eyes on anything?</i>
What's happening?
Say something!
<i>Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday</i>
<i>Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday</i>
<i>Sick on Thursday
Worse on Friday</i>
<i>Died on Saturday
Buried on Sunday</i>
<i>"And that was the end of Solomon Grundy"</i>
What is this?
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>
Stand down!
Fuck off!
Hello, Braxton.
<i>No, no.</i>
<i>Don't...</i>
Don't do that...
Been looking for you for 10 years,
and you're gonna come at me
like we just saw each other yesterday?
That's what you're gonna do?
What did I...
What'd I think?
What'd I think? That you were gonna be
happy to see me, I guess.
I am happy.
I need to finish.
You should go.
I should go?
Okay...
Okay, I'll just go.
<i>But first, I'm gonna ask you a question.</i>
You're gonna give me an answer.
Why would you and Pop go to that funeral?
She left us. Do you not remember that?
Do you not remember that?
It's your fault that Pop's dead!
You hear me?
It's your fault!
- I'm sorry, Braxton.
- Sorry?
Sorry doesn't cut it, you weird fuck!
You don't give a shit about me?
You don't give a shit about me?
How about now?
How about now?
<i>Are you gonna fight?</i>
<i>Fight!</i>
I'm sorry, Braxton.
If you had to see her,
if that was something that you had to do,
you call me.
I'm your brother.
I've always had your back.
You don't call him, you call me.
Did you even wonder where I was?
I knew where you were.
I just wanted you to be safe.
Some of my clients
are quite dangerous.
I'm, kind of, considered
fairly dangerous myself.
Well, you've made improvements.
<i>Shit, man.</i>
You and me here...
What are the odds?
Statistically speaking--
Christ, man! It's rhetorical.
I mean, really?
I was just saying.
Not happy.
Do you consider
what you do important, Mr. Wolff?
To someone other than yourself, I mean?
<i>What I do is.</i>
Living Robotics' public offering
would've been worth billions.
Money to be used
for neuroprosthetics, nanotechnology.
You...
Why in God's name did I ever hire you?
To leak-proof your books.
Dana found a mistake, and you wanted
to be sure it was safe to go public.
And now you want to kill her.
<i>I'm fond of Dana.</i>
But I restore lives, not Dana! Me!
Men, women, children,
I give them hope. Make them whole.
Do you even know what that's like?
Yes, I do.
Sorry.
I missed you.
"Missed you, too, Braxton.
"Missed you, too, because I love you.
"You're my brother."
Maybe...
Do you want to...
Maybe I could see you in a week?
You name the place. I'll be there.
How will I find you?
You won't.
I'll find you.
<i>There.</i>
How do you respond to rumors
that some of the victims have wounds
consistent with anti-aircraft rounds?
<i>I'd say the Chicago Police Department</i>
<i>has ample experience
solving all manner of homicides.</i>
<i>Tom.</i>
Sir, how are the conspiracy
and fraud charges
related to the deaths of Lamar Blackburn
and his sister, Rita?
<i>This is a very fluid situation</i>
<i>with a lot of surprising revelations
over the last 48 hours.</i>
<i>Let me introduce you to the person
leading the investigation...</i>
<i>Agent Medina.</i>
Um...
<i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>As much as I'd like
to take credit for this,</i>
<i>I can 't.</i>
<i>Because this was a team effort</i>
<i>comprised of long hours
of good old-fashioned investigative work.</i>
<i>Questions?</i>
<i>He was just like our other two.
He was a happy baby.</i>
Now he rarely speaks.
It's like our child is missing.
He's not there.
He's lost, and he needs our help.
We thought...
We thought...
We hoped that he would catch back up.
But he didn't.
One in 68 children in this country
are diagnosed with a form of autism.
<i>But if you can put aside for a moment</i>
<i>what your pediatrician and all
the other NTs have said about your son--</i>
<i>What? NTs?</i>
<i>Neurotypicals.</i>
<i>The rest of us.</i>
<i>What if we're wrong?</i>
<i>What if we've been using the wrong tests</i>
<i>to quantify intelligence
in children with autism?</i>
<i>Your son's not less-than.</i>
<i>He's different.</i>
<i>Now, your expectations for your son
may change over time.</i>
<i>They might include
marriage, children, self-sufficiency.</i>
<i>And they might not.</i>
<i>But I guarantee you,</i>
<i>if we let the world set expectations
for our children, they'll start low...</i>
<i>And they'll stay there.</i>
<i>Maybe your son's capable of
much more than we know.</i>
<i>And maybe,</i>
<i>just maybe,</i>
<i>he doesn't understand how to tell us.</i>
<i>Or...</i>
<i>We haven't yet learned how to listen.</i>
Honey, for the hundredth time,
don't wander off like that.
- I'm so sorry.
<i>- It's all right. It's fine.</i>
Can he visit with you
for a while, Justine?
Okay, good. Come on, folks.
I'll give you the nickel tour.
You okay with that?
<i>It's okay, hon. Come on.</i>
<i>No, they'll be fine.</i>
<i>Justine's one of
our few full-time residents.</i>
She stopped talking 30 years ago.
Communicates with
a digital translator now.
<i>Doctor, how is Harbor funded?</i>
<i>We're fortunate to have
very generous private donors.</i>
<i>I'll say they're generous.</i>
<i>Oh, why is that?</i>
That woman, Justine...
- Yeah, my daughter.
- She's your daughter?
The reason I started the institute.
Justine's computer, it's a BX32.
<i>Water-cooled, 12 core.</i>
<i>Oh, that's right.
You're a software engineer.</i>
<i>Well, some of our donors
are more generous than others.</i>
<i>Why? Is that a good computer?</i>
<i>Good?</i>
Doc, she could backdoor
the Pentagon with that rig.
<i>Hello, dreamboat. Shall we chat?</i>
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sign here, please.
Thank you.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
