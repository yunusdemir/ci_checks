What if I told you that even
the worst...
neighborhood in America could
be made completely safe.
And what if I told you that this
can be accomplished...
without risking the life of one
single law enforcement officer.
How do I know this? Because
it's happening, right now.
In every country in the world,
but this one.
I'm Pat Novak, and welcome
to Novak Element.
In tonight's State of the
Union segment...
we'll be joined by General
Curtis Monroe...
live from the War Room at
the Pentagon.
General Monroe, welcome back.
Good to see you, Pat.
Thank you for this unprecedented
access to your operations.
Could you walk us through what
we're seeing here.
This is a routine operation.
We found that...
random patrols help the
local population...
feel safer, and to trust us.
It's amazing.
And, what are these colored dots
that we're seeing here, General?
These are our assets on the
ground.
Uh, in green we got the ED-209s.
They're the big boys...
they secure the perimeter.
Purple are the smaller EM-208s.
They sweep and mop up.
And the red dots, Pat, that's
your film crew.
It is great to see American
machines helping...
to promote peace and freedom
abroad.
Guys, this is standard Op alright,
there is no opposition expected.
I'm gonna set your markers to
Code Red.
All our drones are going to give
top priority to your safety.
No Red Assets have ever been
lost.
Okay.
Does this make you feel better?
But listen, keep those bracelets
on you completely safe.
Okay?
Good.
Enjoy the show!
Alright, let's go.
May peace be upon you.
Please exit your homes with
your arms raised.
For a non-evasive scanning
procedure.
No one will be harmed.
Please exit your homes with
your arms raised...
for a non-evasive scanning
procedure.
Scott, get me a shot of this.
Incredible.
Incredible!
Not long ago that would have
been American...
men and women risking their
lives...
to pacify these people.
General, you care to comment
on this?
Well, Pat, we had Vietnam, we
had Iraq, we had Afghanistan...
Never again.
From a military perspective,
this has been invaluable.
We can accomplish our objectives
without any loss to American lives.
And I think the honest people
over there really appreciate it.
And why wouldn't they?
For the first time in their
lives...
they get to watch their children
grow up...
in an environment of safety
and security.
Let's go.
Kelly, can you hear me, out
there?
Loud and clear, Pat.
I'm here in Sunny Tehran.
Where locals have clearly
embraced these routine scans.
As you can see behind me, they
are working in collaboration...
with the robots...
and obviously their safety
is everyone's top priority.
You'll notice children in the
streets as well...
this is every day life.
Happening in perfect harmony...
Oh great, here here, stay put,
stay put.
Stay put, it's fine, don't worry,
my guys got it.
Drop your weapon.
Kelly, Kelly, are you alright?
Kelly.
We're okay, Pat.
I'm sorry Kelly, but...
for security reasons the Pentagon
is going to cut our feed to Tehran.
But please be careful.
Yeah, I'll continue to stand by.
Now you see how fundamental these
robots are to our foreign policy.
So, then, tell me...
why can't we use these machines
here at home?
Why is America so robophobic?
On the one hand, we have Raymond
Sellers.
An entrepreneur...
And true American, who's product
just saved my colleague's life.
On the other, Hubert Dreyfuss.
A man with both feet planted
firmly in the past...
who's bill prohibits the use
of drones on US soil.
The American people support
the Dreyfuss act.
Because they haven't...
experienced this technology.
And they fear what they don't
understand.
We at the Novak Element support
Mr. Sellers...
to make our country and our
viewers safer.
After all, what's more important
than the safety...
of the American people?
Hey, Murphy.
Hey.
How is Jack?
We don't know yet.
How's it going?
Good.
What the hell are they doing
here?
Six in the morgue, Louis in
hospital.
This was the mother of all
bad ideas.
We got a lead on Antoine Vallon,
we took it.
What lead?
Not in front of them.
This is bullshit.
Yeah?
Yeah, you got something to
say, Murphy?
Vallon's our case.
You got two years without no
arrests, no nothin.
You either got to be dumb,
or dirty.
You got something on us?
Or is this personal?
No, it's nothin personal.
Although I don't like you
as a person.
Okay, you two, out.
No problem.
Maybe if you hadn't gone off
the reservation...
your partner would still be
standing.
What did you say to me?
Hey, that's enough!
Okay, Alex.
It's just you and me, now.
Me and Jack, we've been doing
some street buys.
We get a line on some guns.
And we met up with this low
level G, called Jerry, who...
ends up having a peace he's
not suppose to have.
Where the hell you get a gun
like that, Jerry?
I can get you two whole crates
full, man.
Two crates?
No disrespect Jay, but how
a clown like you...
gets so much product, man?
Hey, what's it matter where
it comes from?
What it matters, we don't want
no dirty guns, Jerry.
These guns got bodies on them,
Jerry?
They're clean, alright. You
gonna buy this shit, or not?
Why you acting so nervous, man?
You fishin' on us, Jerry?
What'd you say?
You think he's fishin', D?
I think he's fishin' on us.
What the hell are they talkin'
about, man?
Let me see your phone, let me
see your phone.
I'm not showing you my phone,
man.
Are you recording this?
What?
I think you're a goddamn cop.
What the hell are you talking
about, man?
Lie down to the ground.
Put your gun down.
We're not cops, alright?
We work for Antoine Vallon.
Hey, hey, hey!
Shut up, shut up, what did
you say?
Ends up he works for Vallon.
Before the meeting, we ran the
serial numbers on the rifles.
They were supposed to be in
our evidence room.
Not out on the street.
The intake...
papers were blank, no signatures.
What have you got?
Nothing.
How do you think that happened?
I tell you Murphy, this is a
mistake.
These guys will shoot you just
to see if their gun work.
We need backup.
We call for backup words going
to get around the station.
And he's going to disappear.
It's gonna be alright.
We told Vallon we were gun
buyers, and he bought it.
What do you two need with that
much product?
You plotting a coup?
Hey, don't trip. We ain't gonna
bust a single shot in your town.
We got some problems back home
with Chicago PD.
Yeah, I heard you don't like
cops.
Hey, boss.
What do you got for me?
Really.
Just about to close the deal.
Someone tipped him off.
Gentlemen, I gotta deal with
this.
Few minutes.
Make sure you kill them both.
I've got two handguns, one
automatic.
You've gotta get out of here!
I'm going to take the automatic.
You sure about this?
You ready?
Move.
Louis.
Officer down, officer down,
331 Hamilton.
This is detective Alex Murphy,
in need of immediate...
medical assistance, 331 Hamilton
Road.
Jack.
Jack, come on Jack, do you
hear me?
Jack, stay with me.
Jack.
Alex, you don't do something
like this...
unless you bring it to me first.
Vallon's connected.
I'm warning you, don't make any
more moves until I vet this.
If officers are supplying
them guns...
That's up to IAD.
I'll handle it.
Washington, DC
I don't care how sophisticated
these machines are, Mr. Sellers.
A machine does not know what
it feels like, to be human.
Can't understand the value of
human life.
Why should it be alowed to
take one?
To legislate over life and death...
we need people who understand
right from wrong.
What do your machines feel?
Well, they feel no anger, the feel
no prejudice, they feel no fatigue.
Which makes them ideal for
law enforcement.
Putting these machines on the
streets...
will save countless American
lives.
Your evading the question.
No, I'm not.
Yes, your evading the question.
I asked, what do these machines
feel?
If one of them, uh, killed a
child...
what would it feel?
Nothing.
That's the problem.
That's why 72% of Americans
will not stand for a robot...
pulling the trigger.
America is the world's most
valuable market...
and we can't touch it.
With a domestic expansion...
we'd clear six hundred billion
dollars per anno.
In other words, every second
that law is in existence...
we're hemorrhaging money.
What do you want me to do?
We've thrown cash at...
senators on both sides of
the isle. Nobody's budging.
They don't want to vote against
their...
constituents, so unless we sway
public opinion...
the battle's lost.
Now, to that effect...
my team have come up with a
pretty aggressive new campaign.
Wow factor off the charts.
We need to give the Americans
a product they can love.
A figure they can rally behind.
Sir, I have dissected this bill.
There are no loop holes. We can't
put a machine on the street.
Forget the machine, you saw
the polls.
Americans don't want a machine.
They want a product with a
conscience.
They want...
something that knows...
what it feels like to be human.
We're gonna put a man inside
the machine.
You're not you because of your
legs, your arms, your hands.
You're you, because of your
brain. It's your brain's...
capacity to process information
that makes you who you are.
Relax, and just do what you've
always done.
I've never played with these.
The music doesn't come from
your fingers, Michael...
it comes from your mind.
All you have to do is let
it out.
Please.
Oh, my God.
That's okay.
His emotions are peaking, the
readings are getting clouded.
It's okay.
Relax, if you get too emotional,
it'll change the...
chemistry in your brain.
It'll throw the system out.
You're doing great.
Come on.
I need emotion to play.
It's a beautiful piece, Dennett
can we have a moment?
Thank you.
Now, we agreed on this a long
time ago, Raymond.
I... I... I wouldn't be asked
to develop combat applications.
My work here is driven by it's
own questions.
And your work is brilliant, but
your ideas are being underutilized.
Look, I think I found a way...
to put real revenue stream behind
your research...
and to save thousands of lives
in the process.
You're not keeping up your end,
making me exposed like that.
Detective Murphy's just a
little impulsive.
So, put him on the payroll.
Why are we talking about this?
It won't work.
And now that his partner's got hit,
he's never going to let it go.
What is that?
Louis' hospital. Alex is dropping
by, this afternoon.
In case you want to send flowers.
Yeah.
Kill a cop, look over my
shoulder the rest of my life.
It's not good for business.
Who do you thinks going to be
investigating you?
I'm going to go hard after
them, Dennis.
And have them in bracelets
within a month.
Hey Vallon, I'm locking up
right now.
Camera's off?
Clear.
You were right, we should've
had backup.
I'm sorry.
You're not really sleeping,
are you?
Asshole.
Sergeant, Thomas Ryan, NYPD,
paralyzed from the waist down.
He has let himself go a little...
since the accident.
Pass.
Yep, yeah.
Fair enough.
Officer Alfred Miller, Denver.
Severe...
Cereb... Cerebellerd...
Cerebellar Ataxia.
That's why you're the Doctor,
Doctor.
He scored through the roof
with our urban demos.
Lets keep this one in mind,
I like this guy.
Very good sir.
I saved the best for last.
I give you Sargent Jack Freeman,
masculinity incarnate.
Led Pittsburgh Swat for five
years. Now...
confined to a wheel chair.
I think I can see the appeal.
No.
What?
Why?
I checked the Psych evaluations.
He's far too unstable.
He's trying to say, that he
has a temper.
Have you any idea what we'd
be putting him through?
The psychological strain requires
someone emotionally balanced.
We have to be scientific.
We're not selling a soft-drink
here, are we?
You're right.
Okay, keep looking.
David, what did I say?
Not until you're finished.
Hey, guys.
Hi, dad.
Hey, little monkey.
How's the game, buddy?
Dane got rejected, but we have
a two man advantage.
Oh yeah?
That's fantastic.
Hey D, why don't you head upstairs,
start getting ready for bed?
But he just got home.
I'll be up in a second to tuck
you in, okay?
Alright?
Now give your Mom a kiss.
Good night, baby.
Too slow, boy.
You're just too slow.
How is Jack holding up?
They said a week till he's
back on his feet.
It's my fault, we shouldn't
have even been there.
Here.
Somebody's gotta fix that.
Stop.
Let's not wake up David.
He's suffering 4th degree burns
over 80 percent of his body.
Lower spine has been severed.
If he survives...
he'll be paralyzed from the waist
down, confined to a wheel chair.
Mrs. Murphy...
we don't have to do this.
I need to know everything before
I make a decision.
Please continue.
Vestibular cochlear optic nerves
have been critically damaged.
He'll be blind, in one eye.
And most likely deaf.
Frankly, Dr. Norton and the
Omni foundation...
are the leaders in this field.
In my opinion, this is the
only chance your husband has.
I'd seriously consider their
offer.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I need time to think.
I'm afraid Mrs. Murphy, time
is one thing you don't have.
You say you can save him, but
what does that mean?
What kind of life will he have?
Thanks.
Thanks buddy.
You know this is going to make
me dance again.
Now that I gotta see.
You don't wanna see that.
Here she comes now.
Hold on to that.
Good idea partner.
Every time.
Get her, boy!
Subject is still dreaming.
He's retrieving memories,
trying to make sense of...
sensory stimulation package 37.
Perfect, Kim.
Let's reconnect the spine.
Time to wake him up.
Excuse me?
What are you doing here?
Babe, where are you going?
Louis.
Subject regaining cognitive
functions.
Whats happening?
Where am I?
You were in an explosion, Alex.
You're in a hospital.
Where?
Where's Claire, my wife?
Where is my wife?
I want you to calm down Alex,
listen to me, you're okay.
You're family's fine.
Both your wife and your son.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Dr. Dennett Norton.
I'm treating you.
Heart rate rising.
I can't move.
I can't move.
What the hell is all that?
Visual input, unstable.
I want you to relax.
Subject's dumping too much
epinephrine, should we purge him?
Not yet.
Unlock vertebrate.
Go ahead, Kim. Unlock Upper,
Lower extremities.
What kind of suit is this?
It's life.
Suit Alex's.
It's you.
This was the only option.
We're here, all of us, to make
you whole, again.
Full body unlock.
I want you to walk now, Alex.
You can do that.
Seems so real.
Alex, it's very important you
understand what is happening.
This is real. It's not a dream,
it's not drugs, or anesthetics.
I know I'm dreaming, because
I can feel all of this.
Alex, Amputees can often feel
their missing appendages.
It's called "Phantom Limb"
sensation.
What do you mean amputee?
What the hell did you do to me?
Alex, you need to relax.
Take this off of me, now!
Alex you need to relax.
I need to get out of this thing!
What did you do to me?
What have you done to me?
Alex, hey!
Shut him down!
No!
Let him run, Let him run!
Where am I?
Alex, please.
Stop.
Alex, you have to stop.
Please.
Alex.
Please stop.
Stay where you are, and we'll
come and pick you up.
Okay, Kim.
Shut him down.
Alex.
You can't run from this.
You have to understand the
reality of the situation.
Show me.
Kim.
No.
Holy Christ.
Holy Christ!
Holy Christ, there's nothing
left!
Your body may have gone, but
your still here.
That's not even my brain.
We had to repair the damaged
areas.
But we didn't interfere with
your emotion, or your intellect.
You understand me, Alex?
You're, you're in control.
I'm in control?
Yes.
Okay.
If I'm in control...
then, I want to die.
Just unplug what ever it is
keeping me alive...
and end this nightmare!
Let's say I did that, which as
a doctor...
would be almost impossible
for me, but...
but, say I did.
What do I say to your wife?
What does she say to your son?
That it didn't work.
That you tried, but something
went wrong.
You did everything you could,
but...
I died.
And so, after all they've been
through, all the pain...
all their hope restored, we
just rip that away?
Your wife loves you, Alex. She
singed the consent forms herself.
Otherwise you couldn't have
undergone the procedure.
She loves you and she gave you
a second chance.
I need you to take it.
I don't want to see myself
like this, again.
Ever.
The same goes for my family.
Put me back in.
Zoom in.
Stop.
Zoom in.
Stop.
Accept the connection.
It's so good to finally see you.
I was gonna have to say the
same thing.
I'm sorry.
I know how I must look to you.
I think you look beautiful.
Are they treating you okay,
baby?
So far, the... the...
Dr. Norton seems like a nice guy.
Does David know you're calling?
He misses you.
I can go get him, I just.
No.
I don't want him to see me
like this.
Not yet.
Sure.
We're going to get through
this, baby.
We're going to make it like
it was.
When are you coming home?
We still got some tests.
But they are saying it's going
really well.
The minute they let me...
I gotta go.
I love you.
End the connection.
Okay, blood cleansing initiated.
Viral, and bacterial screening
activated.
Releasing proteins.
Fats, Minerals, and Carbs.
Energy in-flow is at 1320
Kilo-Calories.
Now starting Anti-inflammatory
corticoids, hormones...
and antibiotic protocols.
Standard daily intake.
Who has Anti-depressants?
Let's give him a nice dream.
Alright, here's what you're
dealing with.
Modified M2 Battle Rifle.
50 caliber Beowulf ammunition,
and 30 round clips.
Three shot burst, or full auto.
Heavy Duty.
TSR-66 Cartridge driven taser
pistol.
Each projectile releases up
to 200,000 volts.
It can stun, it can kill, it's
nasty shit.
Your armor. State of the art,
but not invulnerable.
50 caliber or larger, can
penetrate and kill, multiple...
hits and guess who ends up
in the recycling bin.
If you sense you need a weapon,
or are threatened...
the visor goes down, and the
system makes the weapon available.
Gotta remember, it's not the
weapons that count.
It's who's handling them.
Or, in your case... what.
Do you think you can do this?
Just stick to your job.
Just stick to my job?
Combat robots are my job, doc.
Rio, Congo, you name it.
I was there.
Our machines run perfectly.
You ask me, sticking organics
into the system...
is a huge step backwards.
I don't care how well you
designed this thing.
Without my sign-off, it better
start learning Chinese...
cause it ain't never going
home.
It's nice to meet you, too.
Lets do this, Tin Man.
Quality control.
EM208 versus Tin Man.
Rendering Scenario One, now.
Hey, Doc.
I hope you don't mind.
I like a little music while I'm
working.
Alright, alright, let's uh, let
the games begin.
Rock and roll.
Commence scenario.
Lag in the corners.
Did you see that? What my robot
did? That's how you do it.
Your product's afraid.
2.3 seconds behind.
Great.
Drop your gun!
Drop your gun!
Drop your weapon, let the kid go.
Oh, well...
He's worried that the kid's
going to get hurt.
Let the kid go!
Too bad.
Well, there you have it, 5.6
seconds behind. Scenario failure.
I wouldn't buy that for a dollar.
Let's do it again.
It's your funeral.
Detective Alex Murphy.
Search results: Detective Alex
Murphy making a speedy recovery.
Alex Murphy, Man or Machine.
Thrust into the spotlight,
Clara Murphy won't talk.
Antoine Vallon.
Search Results: DPD says Antoine
Vallon is no longer suspect...
due to lack of evidence.
Detroit Free Press.
Unfortunately, Murphy's
investigation into...
Antoine Vallon wasn't authorized,
in the first place.
Murphy was simply overzealous,
okay?
We have absolutely no evidence...
linking Vallon to the attempt
on his life.
All I'm gonna say is that my
partner's a great cop.
And I won't rest...
until the men who tried to kill
him are brought to justice.
What's wrong with him?
No, nothing, nothing.
Watch the procedure bar on
the 20A.
Our machine assesses the threat
and acts.
That's it, two steps.
Now watch Alex.
The software assesses the threat
just like robots.
And it sends the information to
the brain. Alex's brain receives.
The information and then decides
what to do with it...
based on his emotional and
cognitive abilities.
Then the brain relates this
to the AI module.
And...
Yeah, like a year later.
Computers finish the job,
a brain...
You wanted a man inside a
machine...
and that's what you've got,
but the human element...
will always be present. Fear,
instinct, bias, compassion.
They will always interfere
with the...
system.
Okay, but Dennett...
I've gotta give the American
people something...
they can root for. Something
aspirational. Right?
They have to believe in this
thing. Pretty good...
that's not.
I don't know how to sell okay.
We, you and I, have got a release
date. We've gotta make it, okay?
I don't care how you do it,
I'm asking you.
Come on, can you help me?
Just get him...
to do that.
Him to do that.
That is a machine.
I know, but it's a man inside
of a machine.
No, that's a man inside a
machine!
His life depends on it, and the
future of Omnicorp depends on it.
So, get your ass back to China
and get it fixed.
I don't care how you do it,
just go do it.
Tastes like peanut butter...
I can't get it out of my mouth.
You don't like peanut butter?
No.
You like peanut butter, Kim?
I love it.
Okay.
I'm gonna put you to sleep
now, Alex.
Okay.
Put him under, Kim.
What are you planning to do?
Consciousness...
is nothing more...
than the processing of information.
I'm going to fix him...
and he won't know the difference.
Raymond?
Yeah.
We just ran focus groups at
Ryan Correctional facility.
We call this "Combat Mode."
It really put the fear of God
into the prisoners.
Yeah, that's okay.
Get a load of this.
What is that?
He transforms.
Kids love it.
Really?
Focus group numbers, through
the roof.
Really?
That's really embarrassing.
What is this?
You know what?
People don't really know what
they want...
until you show it to them,
most of the time.
Make him more uh... tactical.
Make him look, uh...
let's go with black.
Yeah.
Alex.
He looks like a billion dollars.
$2.6 billion.
Raymond Sellers.
I've looked forward to meeting
you, detective.
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me.
Well, we've founded this program...
to give men like you a second
chance.
You just do your best, today.
Shall we?
Alright.
Mr. Sellers, we're ready for
you.
Okay, great.
This is a detective Sherman.
Good morning, folks.
Okay, so, this is how it's
gonna be.
We're going toe to toe.
Last man standing, wins.
If I hit you, you go back to
the drawing board.
You hit me, you get a ticket
back home.
My guys are going to be shooting
.47 caliber rounds.
Do a little damage, but they
can't take you out.
But make no mistake, Tin Man.
My gun will.
Alex, listen to me.
The EM208s will try to maneuver
you...
so, Mattox can get a clear
shot.
Do not let that happen.
If Mattox hits you, everything but
your life support will shut down.
You will feel more pain than
you've ever felt in your life.
I don't know about that.
I've been through a lot.
Alright.
I say we go on three.
Three.
How's it going, down there?
Whatever you do, don't get
shot in the face.
Dr. Norton, how is he doing this?
His software is faster, his
hardware is stronger.
He is a better machine.
But you said humans hesitate.
Only when there making decisions.
He's not making decisions?
Yes, and no.
In his every day life, man rules
over machine.
Alex makes his own decisions.
When he engages in battle, the
visor comes down...
and the software takes over, and,
uh, the machine does everything.
Alex is a passenger, just along
for the ride.
But, if the machine is in control,
how is...
Murphy accountable?
Who's pulling the trigger?
When the machine fights the system
releases signals into Alex's brain.
Making him think he's doing what
our computers are actually doing.
I mean, Alex believes right now
he is in control.
But, he's not.
It's the illusion of free will.
Crap.
So, you circumvented the law
by creating a machine...
that thinks it's a man.
But, that's illegal.
No.
No, no.
It is a machine that thinks
it's Alex Murphy.
And in my book... that's legal.
Well done.
Well done.
Hey Doctor, what happens if
I tase...
an exoskeleton with a little
asshole inside?
I think we're all curious to
find out.
Go ahead.
If I had a pulse, it'd be racing.
She's been waiting for months.
I'm sure hers is, too.
You're gonna do fine.
I love your sign D.
Hey.
There's nothin to be nervous
about.
Thank you, Dennett.
It's been a privilege.
Hi, Dad.
I missed you, buddy.
Me too.
Want to feel it?
What is it?
It's okay, sweety.
I saved all the Red Wings games,
on my computer.
You did?
How'd they do?
I don't know.
I've been waiting to watch them
with you.
I'd love to, kiddo.
But I can't tonight.
Daddy's suit needs some...
special handling.
You understand?
Thanks for coming, Jack.
I heard you went home already.
Clara should be thrilled to
have you back.
I saw Clara.
And David.
That ain't my home, right now.
It's in a damn lab across the hall.
I'm sorry, Alex.
Starting tomorrow, I'm gonna
take down Vallon...
and his whole damn crew.
I was waiting to hear you
say that.
At least I know you're the
right color, now.
The cooler temperatures here
today...
certainly have not stopped
people from showing up.
We're expecting people from
every corner of the city...
here in Detroit...
to come out and show their support
for Detective Alex Murphy.
You know, a lot of questions
on people's minds today...
is what will he look like?
Is he a changed man?
Rumor has it, he is in the
building, preparing to come out.
Alex, We're going to upload the
entire DPD database into your brain.
That means you'll have instantaneous
access to criminal records.
Plus an archive of CCTV footage
from 2011 to the present.
Alright, hit me.
Kim, it's all yours.
Archive footage uploading
successfully.
You're system draws connections
automatically.
It will link perpetrators to
the crimes and...
give you exact locations, whenever
available.
I have evidence to make
138... I don't know...
one hundred and sixty-six
arrests.
His emotions are stable.
This is incredible.
You will notice his family is
here in the building, as well.
The mayor is standing on stage
behind me, also Raymond Sellers...
from Omnicorp. They seem like
great friends. Obviously...
echoing the partnership they
brought together.
How much longer will this take?
Well, the...
feed from the database is
almost done.
We're approaching present day.
634 pending arrests.
We're gonna need a bigger prison.
He's on top of her...
Doctor Norton, he's getting
too emotional.
I've gotta do something!
Alex... Alex, calm down.
Take a breath.
Relax.
Kim, what are the readings?
I haven't seen them at levels
like this.
He's gonna shoot him!
Alex, Alex, Alex, relax.
Relax.
Alex...
What is this?
Is this a computer glitch?
No that's his own crime scene.
He's spiking all over the place.
Alex!
Alex!
The system is crashing, Doctor.
Alex, can you hear me?
Alex, Alex.
I'm not sure he can handle this.
I've got to do something!
He's emotionally overloaded.
Unlock me!
Stop! Stop it!
He's having a seizure!
Kim, shut it down.
Alex!
Give me a live feed.
I can't do it, Doctor Norton...
Do it now!
Jesus Christ!
Dr. Norton?
What?
The press is waiting. We have
to get him up there, now.
What do you want me to do?
I don't know, fix him.
Do what you have to do.
Your reputation is on the line,
every bit as much as ours.
We're running out of time.
Okay.
Everybody out.
Out!
Mayor Duran is about to take
to the stage...
and introduce Detroit's newest
weapon in the war on crime.
I'm actually getting word that
he's ready to go right now.
Heart rate rising. He might
start spiking, Doctor.
So, he just have to absorb dopamine
and noradrenaline.
But you'll be taking away his
emotions.
Drop the levels until I tell
you to stop.
Doctor, you'll be taking away
his ability...
Now, please.
to feel anything.
Hold the footage, put it on
a loop.
Dopamine levels at 20%.
More.
Dopamine levels at 10%.
More.
Dopamine levels at 5%
Lower.
You're flatting him out.
Lower!
2%.
Hold it there.
Alex?
Alex, how do you feel?
I feel fine, Dr. Norton.
Well, today, I'm not here to
talk about crime prevention.
I am here to give you the cure.
Hi, Dad.
Dad?
Ladies and gentlemen, the
revolution begins right now...
with Detective Alex Murphy.
What's he doing?
He looks like a zombie.
I think he accessing Criminal
data.
Thomas King!
You're under arrest.
Until today, Thomas King was
a convicted felon...
wanted for rape, arson, and
murder.
This man has torn apart American
families.
On the loose, for six years.
And where was this criminal
mastermind hiding?
Right in front of the police
headquarters.
Here he is, just steps away
from two of Detroit's finest.
These two officers are completely
unaware...
of the monster in their midst.
And then, in sixty seconds...
I repeat, just sixty seconds...
Detective Murphy brings him down.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can not afford an attorney...
one will be provided for you.
This, my friends, is the future
of American justice.
How many like Thomas King will
pay for their crimes, now...
that Robocop is here?
Yes!
Let's not shy away from what
this means, people.
Men weren't up to the task.
But Alex Murphy, a robot cop,
was.
We can't take him off the street.
This is what I'm saying.
He's a hit.
A big, fat, stinking hit.
Until he breaks down in front
of everyone.
Hey, we all knew there'd be
issues.
It was inevitable.
Dennett, you're my guy.
I just need you to get a handle
on this.
I need more time. Scientifically,
we're in uncharted water.
We need to take him back to
the lab and do more tests.
I mean, it was like, something
was interfering with our system.
Something beyond chemistry,
or physics.
Like what?
His soul?
Hey, look... this train has
already left the station.
We can't exactly go out to
the world and say:
Sorry, we released a defective
product.
So, no matter what we do...
we just need to keep him on
the streets.
What about the interviews?
Cancel them, cancel all of them.
Everything.
In fact, Dennett...
let's uh...
Let's keep the wife at a
distance for now, as well.
I would like to see him.
Can you arrange that?
Look, I won't lie to you.
Alex was so nervous we had to
sedate him.
I looked in his eyes and I
couldn't see my husband.
And then he just shoots a man
in front of our son.
That's not sedation.
He's responding to drugs
differently, now.
We both knew from day one,
there would be complications.
Just give me a little more time.
I promise...
you'll have your husband back.
This goes for every squad in
every department.
Detective Murphy will have full
access to all investigations.
Robberies, narcotics, homicides.
If he requests to take over a case,
the case will be handed to him.
No arguments, no complaints.
This is Bullshit!
I said no complaints!
And I mean it!
Now...
Good morning, chief Dean.
Good morning, officers.
I've selected thitreen targets
today, all wanted for murder.
John Biggs is target No 1.
I'ill be taking over this case.
Ambulances, detention vehicles
and coroners...
should be ready to move in,
on my request.
I wish you all a very good day.
Murphy...
you okay, man?
I'm fine, Sergeant.
Can't wait to get back to work,
thinking Daniels is the shit...
Excuse me, I have casework.
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
Walter Karrel, look at me.
You have two options. Option 1:
I shoot you with 50,000 volts...
which may cause respiratory
failure...
organ malfunction, internal
burns...
and loss of bowel and bladder
control. And then, I arrest you.
Option 2: You tell me where
John Biggs drug lab is located.
And then, I arrest you.
You have two seconds to decide.
Totally justifiable.
We are going to make a lot of money.
Nothing. No fear, no increase
in heart-rate...
no traces of anger, whatsoever.
Congratulations, Doctor.
You did it.
Yes, I did.
I told you, sir. Norton clearly
never had control of the product.
I agree.
And that's why I called you here.
I just want a second pair of
eyes on this thing, that's all.
Okay, I'll need a feed from
the Tin Man's head.
Plus full surveillance of
the lab.
You're gonna have full access
to everything.
If anything comes up...
I'll be in Washington.
He brought peace to this
country's most violent city.
He showed us all that Detroit
and America...
can have a brighter future...
a future of economic growth.
Freedom and happiness.
On tonight's show, a visionary
and true patriot.
The CEO of Omnicorp, Raymond
Sellers.
Hello, Pat Raymond.
Thanks for having me.
You must be doing a victory
lap about now.
Two weeks ago, Omni stock went
through the roof.
And the Senators finally agreed
to vote on the repeal...
of the Dreyfuss act.
Well, look, I mean the tide
is definitely turning.
I just feel certain that soon we'll
be keeping all Americans safe.
I certainly hope so.
But, I think our next guest will
have a different point of view.
Hubert Dreyfuss. Senator, thank
you for joining us.
Hello, Pat.
Mr. Sellers.
Senator, do you know what
this is?
The American public is divided
on the Dreyfuss act.
Our polls at Novak-Element.com
are tight.
50% to 50%.
There is no doubt Omnicorp
created a sensation,
But this bill is not about
Alex Murphy.
It's about weather America's
willing to give robots...
the authority over human lives.
No, no, no, no, look, look.
Look.
This, uh, C-change we're witnessing,
and it is a C-change...
shows that Americans don't really
care...
if our law enforcement systems
are manned, or unmanned.
What they care about is efficiency,
and they care about safety.
You're clouding the issue.
This is clearly an attempt
to sway public opinion...
with a marketing stunt.
What's clear is, with just one
system in place...
we've cut crime by 80%.
Just imagine if we put...
I don't know, lets say a hundred
systems in place.
And then I want you to ask
yourself...
why are you holding us back?
Is that your plan...
Thank you, Senator.
And thank you, Raymond.
Thank you, Pat.
Well, there you have it.
Who could argue with that?
Which begs the question.
Has the US Senate become
Pro-Crime?
Yeah, hi.
Number 5000.
Call me tomorrow.
Hey, guys. Vallon's waiting
for you, inside.
What, you're too busy to walk
us in?
I'm out here, making money.
Yeah.
Where are my trip wires?
Now I gotta do this myself?
What took you so long?
What the hell is all this shit?
I can't move any product with
this thing on the streets.
What are you doing to protect me?
Relax, the guy's a walking zombie.
Tell me your phones are off.
He's not going after you, we've
covered our tracks.
Can't manufacture evidence out
of thin air.
If he does, I'm ready for him.
Well?
I've been getting calls.
From whom?
Well, Clara...
we need to let her see her
husband. She has rights.
That's not your decision.
That's legal's call.
But it is only a question of time
until she turns up on television.
Well, she can try.
I'll issue a gag order, before
I'll let her see her husband.
I'll hope to it.
Alex.
Alex!
Alex.
You need to come home.
Clara, please stand aside.
You need to speak to your son.
Right now I see three crimes
in progress.
Alex, listen to me.
I know you're in there.
David won't show his face at
school.
He's having nightmares.
He's falling apart.
I'm falling apart.
Please...
I can't do this on my own.
He's been scared, ever since
that night.
What do you think she's gonna do?
What's he gonna do?
You okay?
David?
He's supposed to be watching
this.
Instead, he's accessing images
of Clara and David...
arriving at school, over and
over again.
Somehow he's overriding the
system's priorities.
You want me to shut him down?
No.
Not yet.
I want to see what happens.
What's he doing at his house?
Look, he's disobeying protocol.
You have to shut him down.
As far as I can tell, he's still
doing his job.
Adrian, give me an image of
his brain.
He's undoing what we did to him.
His dopamine levels are coming
back to normal.
How is that even possible?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Alex?
Alex, please return to the
station.
I want to run some tests.
Well, this should be interesting.
We're not cops, alright?
We work for Antoine Vallon!
What did you say?
We work for Antoine Vallon.
My hand, man!
Where is Antoine Vallon?
You broke my hand, man!
I know you remember me, Jerry.
Where's Vallon?
No, wait! Wait, man!
If I tell you where Vallon is,
he'll kill my wife and kid, man.
Your wife left you in 2019, after
filing charges for domestic abuse.
And you don't have a kid.
But I do.
I'm not asking again!
Look, I swear man, I don't
know where Vallon is, okay?
The only guy I talk to is his
driver, Marcus.
That's it man, that's it!
Does he have a phone number?
We have a problem.
Alex is breaking protocol.
What's he doing?
He's off solving his own murder.
That is genius.
Why didn't I think of that?
How long until he gets here?
Five minutes.
Alright.
Johnny, you stay on these
monitors.
What happened?
Some idiot used an unencrypted
phone.
Shit!
Alright, everyone listen up!
He's coming.
If he leaves alive, you don't!
How do we stop him?
With 50 caliber and above.
Aim for the head.
This one's set.
Go!
Go!
Run!
Come on!
Ready to go!
They're all set.
Finish it!
Free shot!
Watch out.
Need me to call a doctor?
Come on Jack, you're gonna like this.
What's going on? What the hell
are you doin' here?
Y'all gonna play good cop,
bad cop?
No, Daniels.
Bad cop, Robocop.
I've recovered twenty-six guns
from Vallon's warehouse.
Thirteen serial numbers match...
weapons missing from evidence, and
I got your prints all over them.
This is bullshit!
I also...
I also have CCTV footage of
you and Vallon the same day...
he tried to kill me.
Why don't we talk about this?
It won't work, now that his
partner's got hit...
he's never gonna let it go.
What is that?
Louis' hospital.
Murphy's dropping by, this
afternoon.
If I kill a cop, I'm looking
over my shoulder...
You know what they do to cops
in prison, man?
Being locked up with the same
dudes you put in there.
Think, before he gives you up.
Don't shoot me.
Okay!
I swear to Christ, it was Dean.
She helped pull those guns.
Just don't shoot me.
Thank you for your cooperation.
You can cuff him now, Jack.
Now I know why we couldn't
get an arrest.
Vallon was protected from up
on high.
Alex, I can explain.
You tipped him off, today.
Come on man, don't do this.
You tried to kill me twice!
I trusted you, and you destroyed
my family.
Confess.
Now...
in front of everyone.
Confess!
What happened?
Tin Man is down.
Had to be done.
Why?
Product shot a corrupt cop.
Two more seconds and the Chief's
brains would have...
been splattered across the 6
o' clock news.
We got anything on her?
No, she's the Chief of the
Detroit Police Department.
What do you think?
You know what?
This might actually tip this
thing right into the net.
Alex, I don't know if you can
hear me...
but tonight you uncovered a nest
of vipers...
inside the Detroit Police
Department.
And in so doing, you shed light
on an invaluable truth.
Even the police...
the men and women who swore
to keep us safe...
they can be bribed.
They can be bought.
Machines, however, are corruption
free.
Americans could be living in a
country where law enforcement...
is not only efficient...
but incorruptable.
Thank you Alex, for all
you've done.
And for all that you are.
Detective Murphy is currently
in a critical condition.
Our Doctors are working
ceaselessly...
but at this time, it is unclear
if he will survive.
Mrs. Klein, how do you think
the attempt on Detective...
Alex Murphy's life will effect
tomorrow's vote...
for the Dreyfuss act?
At this time Omnicorp's sole
concern is...
the full recovery of Detective
Murphy.
How many times does Detective
Murphy have to give his life...
for his country?
I sincerely hope the Senate
makes the right vote tomorrow...
so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices...
will not have been in vain.
Senator Dreyfuss is my friend.
He has been my mentor and
my strength...
in times of difficulty, on this
floor.
But despite all that, I work
for the state of Ohio...
and the safety of it's citizens
is my top priority.
So, I vote yes. The Dreyfuss
act must be repealed.
That's us ahead, 39 to 10.
Yeah, I spoke to the senate
liaison.
It looks like it's in the bag,
but we still have to tred...
carefully with the politicians.
We're here live at DPD
headquarters...
where moments ago Clara Murphy...
made a shocking statement.
What the hell?
Omnicorp has denied me and
my son...
access to Alex, for weeks.
I demand to know why.
This treatment is inhuman...
and someone needs to be held
accountable.
Oh, we're fucked.
No, we only need 12 votes. She
shouldn't make much difference.
What about after the vote?
Those two should not be allowed
to contact.
If... if she starts putting ideas
in his head...
Bring her in.
I'll handle the explanation.
And what about Alex?
Unfortunately, we can't just keep
him on ice.
The shooting at the station
spooked some of the politicians.
They're our clients, we have
to take care of them.
They're fine when a machine is
lowering the murder rate, but...
when a man is investigating
city politics...
they get nervous.
Alright.
First, it's not a man, okay?
It's property of Omnicorp.
And politics are the least of
your concern.
I mean this thing solved it's
own murder.
How long until it realizes you
haven't been on the level with it?
If that happens, every journalist
in this country...
is dying to speak with him.
I mean we created a hero.
What happens when he opens
his mouth?
What's bigger then a hero?
A dead hero.
Get me Doctor Norton.
What is this, Raymond?
You have Mattox spying on me...
and now this bullshit about
critical condition?
You and I know, Alex is fine!
Calm down, Dennett.
Your work is so good that...
It is not about my work!
You saw the woman on TV!
This has to stop!
You're right, but let me ask
you something.
What kind of life have we really
given Alex Murphy?
He's never going to be a normal
man, a father, a husband.
By the time we put the other units
on the street, he's just...
Dennett...
let's face it.
We failed him.
We failed Alex Murphy.
But I want you to think about
the bigger picture...
cause that's what we're talking
about.
The work you've done with him is
going to be studied for decades.
You've changed the face of
history, Dennett.
No policeman is ever going to
die in the line of duty again...
because of you.
Think about that.
I want that family taken care of.
Beyond their wildest dreams.
We owe them that.
I agree.
I want full funding.
Ten years.
New staff.
All my own people.
Fantastic.
Deal!
Hey, what's going on?
Security's here...
they're clearing everyone out.
They're not waking him up.
What ever you do, don't leave
him alone.
What do you mean they're not
waking him up?
The voting period has ended.
The clerks have tabulated
the results.
The yeas are 63.
The neighs are 22.
The majority of senators have
voted in the affirmative.
The Dreyfuss act has been
repealed by Congress.
God, you guys are slow.
Like a bunch of girls.
This is Mattox.
Dennett's on board.
It's about time.
Call it.
Get it done.
My pleasure.
Mrs. Murphy...
You can come here as much as
you want...
you can threaten me, you can
sue me, you can take my home...
but I'm not going to stop until
I see my husband.
Do you understand that?
Mr. Sellers would very much
like to see you.
Is Alex okay?
He has important information
to share with you.
Will you accompany me?
David...
we gotta go, can you grab
your coat?
Hey?
I'm in the elevator on my way
down. I need access to the lab.
That's insane, they're still
here.
Distract them.
Okay.
I cannot...
There's a lady in here, going
hysterical.
She will not let us in, she's
got the codes for the door.
I repeat, she will not let
us in.
Lady, you need to let us in
there, now.
We have to get in there.
Are you not understanding
what I'm saying?
Do you want to be responsible
for the death of everyone...
in this building?
Hey, stop!
Don't shoot!
Step outside.
Unlock the transmitter!
Transmitter unlocked.
Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.
Right away, sir.
Wake him up!
Alex!
Alex, it's Doctor Norton.
You have to wake up!
Alex, can you hear me?
These men are here to kill us!
They're here to kill us, for
Christ sakes!
Mrs. Murphy, last night, Alex
had a psychotic break.
He killed an unarmed colleague...
and later suffered a seizure.
We did everything, everything,
we could...
but the doctors couldn't save
him.
Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.
We're going to be making the
announcement shortly.
You shut me down. I was about
to get a confession.
Mattox shut you down.
I removed your transmitter,
so, he wouldn't do it again.
Sellers can't afford to wake
you up.
He sent these guys to pull
the plug.
He wants you dead, Alex.
You understand?
Sorry, if there is anything we can
do for you and David, we'll do it.
I want nothing from you.
I understand.
You stay out of our lives.
You and your company.
If that's what you think is best.
There's one more thing.
I think it will be to the benefit
of everyone...
especially David, if we kept
this matter private.
We don't want to damage Alex's
legacy.
Alex!
Alex, I can fix this.
You lied to me.
You lied to my wife.
You're working for the people
that are trying to kill me?
You want me to trust you, Doctor?
Alex, I can go to the press!
Alex, I can tell them the
whole story!
Alex!
Listen to me, please!
Alex!
Alex!
What the hell?
Give all of our systems a
green light.
For Christ sakes, get Sellers
on the phone.
Roger that.
Damn, damn, damn, damn...
Look at this city.
So beautiful.
It's become so peaceful.
I wish I had good news for
Detroit.
I have very sad news.
Despite our best efforts to
save him...
Alex Murphy passed away, just
hours ago.
Alex Murphy...
Mr. Sellers.
What is it?
Mattox just called.
We need you to come with us, now.
Ma'am, I need you to turn
around and go the...
other way, please.
What are you talking about?
We've got a security situation,
here.
I need you to turn around and
go the other way.
Sir, there is a car outside...
That area is locked down, now go!
What's happening?
I said go!
I want to talk to Mr. Sellers.
Mr. Sellers.
How close is the helicopter?
About ten minutes, sir.
Excuse me.
Yes?
I need to speak with with
Sergeant Jack Lewis.
It's an emergency.
Stand by.
Mr. Sellers, apparently there
is a Clara Murphy in the lobby.
What?
Yeah, Raymond...
If she sees him we are dead
in the water.
What do you want to do?
Bring Ms. Murphy up here.
Yes, sir.
Norton said that they may be
using drones for protection.
So, what ever you do, do not
draw your weapons.
They won't shoot if we're
unarmed.
Clear?
Clear!
Hold it right there!
Don't move!
This is private property!
You are not authorized to
be here!
I would put those guns down
now, if I were you.
Stand down, stand down.
Alright, okay, we're good...
Head to the lower level!
Hold up! Hold up!
Ram it!
Gun it!
Go, go, go, go!
Alex, run!
Omnicorp security!
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons.
Keep your hands above your head
and no one will be harmed.
What's going on?
Mrs. Murphy, I want you to
listen to me carefully.
The organic part of your
husband, Alex, is dead.
The robotic part of him is
malfunctioning.
And he's shooting off the building.
So, we gotta get you...
and your son out of here,
right away.
I gotta take this call.
He just left the lobby.
He's headed our way.
Roger that, sir.
Don't shoot my robot, you just
flank at it.
Tin Man!
Tin Man?
Tin Man.
Oh, there it is.
You look like crap.
What's the matter?
Can't shoot?
What were you thinking?
This isn't a drill.
You're a robot.
I am a Red asset.
I wrote that myself.
What do you think?
Come on Tin Man, just pull
the trigger.
Pull it.
You can run.
Go on.
Run!
Run.
There you go.
Run!
Run!
Run!
Stings like a bitch, don't it?
Lucky, lucky, I didn't have my
gun set to kill.
Hey listen, this isn't personal.
Well, maybe a little.
I'm gonna put you out of
your misery.
Helicopters approaching.
Mr. Sellers boards first.
No, no. Mrs. Murphy, you and
your son can get on first.
Officer down, mechanical room,
Omnicorp Building.
Roger that, EMS on the way.
You're going to be okay, Jack.
Non fatal.
Go, go!
Omni LZ Helo-1, on approach
to deck.
What's that?
He's got a gun!
What?
Pull up!
Pull up!
What the hell is he doing?
Sorry sir, I don't know.
Alex?
Dad?
Clara, David...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait...
Get out of the way.
Alex, put down the gun.
Clara, take David and get out
of the way, now!
Raymond Sellers, you're under
arrest for the attempted murder...
of a police officer.
You're here to cuff me?
Alright.
Go ahead.
Cuff me.
You can't, you're not
programmed that way.
If you go against the program,
the entire system shuts down.
You don't even have a warrant.
We'll overlook this little...
Get down on the ground and put
your hands behind your back.
I'm just from marketing.
Now!
Okay.
Yep, yep yep yep...
Alex, we need to work together.
Because I'm the one with the
technology to keep you alive.
Dead or alive, you're coming
with me.
Right.
Weapon.
Alex, honestly, I mean you
no harm.
If I wanted to, I could have
killed you a long time ago.
I'd just aim this right at
your head and blow it off.
Sellers, please!
Don't!
And if I wanted to, I could just
aim this at your little family.
And I could just kill them, too.
And really there's nothing
you can do about it...
because, lets face it...
you're a robot.
You understand that?
Alex.
Dad!
Hey...
everything's gonna be alright.
Everything's gonna be alright.
How are you feeling, Alex?
I'm ready.
He's ready.
There's still no word from
Omnicorp's parent company, OCP.
And although the government says
they are rebuilding Alex Murphy...
Rumors continue to swirl about
his condition.
But we have obtained exclusive
video, taken by a cell phone...
that shows...
the people of Detroit may have
Alex Murphy...
back on the street, sooner than
they think.
The real tragedy here, is that
our President...
chose to uphold the Dreyfuss act.
I have no doubt that he was
manipulated by bias media.
And by whistle blower Dennett
Norton.
I acknowledged we know less
then we thought.
But I do believe my research
program is sound.
What I did with it...
was wrong.
The fact...
that this motherfucker...
is not serving time in some
federal penitentiary...
is a huge, hot, heaping pile
of horseshit!
Now, I know some of you may
think...
that this kind of thinking is
dangerous...
and these machines violate your
civil liberties.
Some of you even believe...
that the use of these drones
overseas...
makes us the same kind of
bullying imperialists...
that our forefathers were
trying to escape.
To you I say: Stop whining!
America is now, and always
will be...
the greatest country on the
face of the Earth!
I'm Pat Novak.
Good night.
