Says your sourCe got religion
while he was in the Can.
-You trust him?
-No.
SharP, we're going to a ChurCh.
That's why l didn't bring a heliCoPter.
Everybody, get your hands uP.
Now keeP them uP...
and say, ''Hey!''
Say, ''Oh!''
All right. Then go ahead.
We have learned from the three wise men...
The O'Jays...
Eddie, Walter, and the other guy...
that there is a train Coming...
and it is a train of love.
MiChael rowed his boat ashore.
BeCause he, too, wanted to get
off that water and get on the train.
Had the tjcket.
And l, too, want to be on that same train.
So l will see everyone next week. HoPefully.
PerCy Stevens. What's it been?
Three to five years with time off
for good behaviour?
SharP, how are you?
This is a ChurCh, all right?
A PlaCe that's saCred.
And it shall remain untainted.
We're looking for an old Cellmate of yours,
Morgan Ball. You seen him?
He's a key witness in one of my Cases.
Come on, man.
l don't hang with that Crowd anymore.
l am a ProPhet in a non-Profit world.
Aren't you worried about him getting away?
l'm more worried
about him having a heart attaCk.
You want me to Call an ambulanCe for you?
Look, man, l don't even know
why l'm running in the first PlaCe.
l'm on God's side now.
Give us the Phone, PerCy.
Man, why are you all treating me
like l'm some little Punk kid?
Besides, the Lord says:
''He who is without sin Cast the first stone.''
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-lt sliPPed.
Where's the damn Phone at?
Holy Cow!
lt's a musiCal Cow. Look at it. lt's a miraCle.
Like the Parting of the Red Sea.
Or the time l saw Mike Tyson's faCe
in a taCo.
What is he doing?
No. l know he's not about to do that.
Come on, man.
He gonna really Put his hand uP that Cow?
You Can't do that.
lt's against the Cow's rights, man.
What's uP with the....
All the way.... ln the hand....
lt's for you.
Hello.
Hey, Morgan. Calm down, man.
All units, stand by for the whereabouts
of our friend Morgan Ball.
They're Coming in.
Texas Rangers looking for Morgan Ball!
Sure hoPe we don't have the wrong house!
Go to hell!
Morgan, don't run.
Eddie Zane, FBl.
How the hell did that fire start?
l don't know. We heard some shots.
-Who's in there?
-SharP and Swanson.
Christ.
You know what's in those barrels, right?
One wrong shot and we Could all go.
Look, Ball, you have three ChoiCes:
A: You Could stay in this hellhole
and burn to death.
B: You Can Come with us
and testify against John Cortland.
A and B suCk.
What about C?
C is my Personal favourite.
Take it easy.
l'm sure there's a way
we Can work out this whole thing.
Seems like it's Pretty well worked out to me.
l got money. Lots of money.
lf you get me out of here,
l'll make you both riCh.
Look, see this key? lt's yours.
Thank you. l'll Put that in evidenCe.
Look, l Can't testify.
Cortland will kill me. lt's a death sentenCe.
Let's go outside and talk it over.
You gotta be kidding me.
NiCe job, SharP.
What's that they say?
''Texas Rangers always get their man''?
That's the Royal Canadian Mounted PoliCe.
You both have funny hats and funny boots.
Who Can tell you aPart?
-Long time, Eddie.
-More than five years.
Margaret Swanson, Eddie Zane.
He's with the Federal Bureau of ldiots.
l'd have beCome a Ranger
if they said my Partner would look like you.
lf you were a Ranger,
you'd have Caught this bastard by yourself.
That's the beautiful thing
about working for the federal government.
Other PeoPle do your grunt work for you.
-How's your daughter doing?
-Real good.
ExCuse me, l'm bleeding here.
Get down!
You're gonna be okay.
Just hang in there. EMT is on the way.
Oh, my God, you guys. lt is so hot out there.
l'm so hot, l think l'm sweaty.
Oh, God. l need to get some air.
Oh, my God. You guys, Come here.
-What?
-Just Come here.
Guys, Come here.
l think this guy got mugged or something.
-What?
-Where?
-Should we Call the CoPs?
-No.
l think this guy's Coming to helP him.
Once agajn, put jt together...
for the lovely ladjes
of your Texas Longhorn cheer squad.
What the hell haPPened?
l heard a shot.
l turned the Corner, l got CliPPed.
-Did you get a good look at him?
-No.
Hello.
-You okay?
-l'm fine.
-l ordered for you.
-Good.
-Medium rare, right?
-Yeah.
How's sChool?
You know. The usual.
How's your mum?
l wouldn't really know.
She and Keith took uP sCuba diving.
Anyway, she was Cleaning the house
and she wanted you to have these.
This is a beautiful PiCture of you
and your mum there in little bathing suits.
Oh, there's that donkey.
l keeP looking for a PiCture of you and me,
but l guess l was always taking the PiCtures.
No, you were just never there.
Or that.
So, l'm aPPlying to a few Colleges.
RiCe, SMU and....
SharP.
Yeah, l'm on my way.
-Look, l've got to....
-Go. l get it.
Sorry.
l'm fine.
-Looks like you've been busy.
-Yes, sir.
-Hell, ain't it?
-Yes, sir.
They said you had some witnesses.
Yeah, they Came waltzing in here
about a half hour ago.
Said they saw the whole thing.
-Anybody else know about this?
-No.
Can we keeP it that way?
l'm tired of being shot at.
You bet.
Who are your witnesses?
Cheerleaders.
You knoW, I thjnk We could be on the neWs.
I'm not talkjng local.
I'm thjnkjng maybe katje Courjc or Oprah.
We shouldn't have come here.
I need to get to the ljbrary.
NoW I'll never get my psych paper done.
I'll just keep seejng hjs head explode.
Evje, remember What We sajd?
You got to breathe.
Let ajr jn, and noW let that ajr out, okay?
l totally have a double Chin.
l don't trust CoPs.
We shouldn't say anything
till our lawyers get here.
We don't need laWyers.
We djdn't do anythjng.
Relax, everybody.
We just came here to tell them What We saW.
-Do we have to?
-Yes.
As Cheerleaders,
we're role models to the Community at large.
lf we don't do the right thing,
how Can we exPeCt others to?
Now l'm gonna throw uP.
l'm not gonna be staying here all night long.
Why don't we just tell these PeoPle
that we need to resChedule for tomorrow?
Well, l Can't do morning.
l'm having my legs waxed.
l have a bioChem lab at noon.
l'm good between 2:30 and 4:00.
Would that work for everybody?
Don't work for me.
And who are you?
Roland SharP, Texas Ranger.
Oh, my God. Do you know Derek Jeter?
No, he means the other Texas Rangers.
You know, like the Lone Ranger.
He had that Cool lndian friend.
What was his name?
Tonto?
He was hot.
Why don't guys wear loinCloths anymore?
A Texas Ranger was shot this evening
in ConneCtion to the murder you witnessed.
Anything you remember,
no matter how insignifiCant...
may be of the utmost imPortanCe.
-Do you want a PieCe?
-No, l do not.
-You don't like gum?
-No.
Chewing gum is the most signifiCant faCtor
in the deCline of Western Civilization.
The deCline of what?
When PeoPle Chew gum,
nobody Can read their exPressions.
Like with BOTOX.
l like an older man
who knows what he wants.
All right.
We should so not get involved in this.
Oh, God, here she goes again.
-She do this a lot?
-Whenever she gets nervous.
She droPs, like, 10 Pounds around finals.
Can anybody desCribe the PerPetrator?
''PerPetrator''?
The bad man with the gun.
ACtually, he was kind of Cute.
Gross. He was a total skank.
On a sCale of 1 to 10, l'd give him a 4.
No, a ruthless killer's kind of sexy.
l give him an 8.
Let's try to ConCentrate. How tall was he?
Average. Like, 5'10''.
No way. 6'2'' at least.
l thought he was kind of short.
What about his hair?
Definitely needs to rethink his Cut.
-l mean the Colour of his hair.
-lt was dark. Almost blaCk.
l thought it was blond.
-What?
-This is bad.
Did he have any...
distinCtive faCial CharaCteristiCs?
Sideburns? A moustaChe?
-There might've been a moustaChe.
-No, definitely not.
Was l the only one who saw a goatee?
Look at these guys.
You guys, wait.
Wait. Looks like your ex-boyfriend,
Brook Burton.
No, he doesn't.
Morning, CaP.
The Dixie ChiCks here...
looked at 5,759 mug shots last night.
Wee. Look at thjs bad boy.
He js yummy!
He's kjnd of a cross betWeen
the Unabomber and Mark Wahlberg.
l now know the hottie rating
of every ex-ConviCt...
in the western United States.
Been uP all night,
haven't learned a goddamn thing.
Please tell me thjs sWeet thjng
js out on parole.
Look at hjm. He's fjne.
Gjrl, good.
Oh, my God, you guys,
I thjnk thjs guy js jn my polj- scj class.
They all said they Could lD that feller
if they saw him again.
That's a two-way mirror, girl.
PeoPle are watChing you.
l know.
What do you think?
l don't know what to think.
l feel really...
old.
ExCuse me, CaPtain.
The Governor's offiCe just Called.
Good.
Thanks for Coming, fellas.
l'm getting Phone Calls from some daddies
that are worried about their daughters.
They have good reason to be ConCerned, sir.
lf Cortland finds out there are witnesses,
he'll Come after them sure as hell.
Gentlemen, l told those guys we'd take Care
of their daughters. Stay with them.
-Yes, sir.
-Good luCk, Roland.
ls the taller blond Anne or Barb?
l Can't remember their names.
-HE-BAT.
-''He'' what?
HE-BAT. lt's a mnemoniC deviCe, son.
Heather, Evie, Barbara, Anne, Teresa.
HE-BAT.
This is a PlainClothes oPeration.
Take your hat off. ConCeal your badge.
Try to look normal.

l feel the full brunt of your gratitude.
Thank you again, sir.
Get in the damn van.
You, move over.
You think you Could turn some musiC on
or something?
-Turn the motor off.
-Problem, sir?
We don't have a seCure Cabin.
This vehiCle will not move
until all these ladies buCkle uP.
You're kidding, right?
One thing you'll learn about me is
l do not kid, or jest, or joke, or jaPe...
or quiP.
Looks like we're waiting on you, Teresa.
l saw that.
l saw that, too.
l see everything.
Mr. Cortland, do you exPeCt
any further Charges to be filed against you?
Mr. Cortland,
how do you feel about the verdiCt?
After failing to ProduCe any evidenCe...
the government has droPPed all Charges
against John W. Cortland.
Needless to say,
my Client is Pleased with this outCome.
What about the murder
of a key government witness last night?
lf you'll exCuse us, Mr. Cortland
is anxious to get home to his family.
No further Comment.
Are you denying any Prior knowledge?
Zane.
It's me. I stjll don't have the money
Ball stole from me.
And the shooter you brought jn
shot a Ranger.
l Covered for him. The job got done.
Even shot myself jn the arm.
You're a free man.
Yeah, well, here's the thing.
You left some witnesses.
Hey, Pull uP over here.
Now you listen here.
You better start Cleaning this mess uP.
Already on it.
l got to shower.
TriPle-loCk all the doors,
Put magnetiC ContaCts on all the windows.

Y'all Can Put your audio and visual stuff

Where do you want your stuff at, sir?
On the CouCh in the front room,
faCing the door.
Yes, sir. Where do we bed down, sir?
With that bunCh of sCholars over there.
Have fun.
Ladies, if l might have y'all assemble

Root beer? No, sir.
Then why are you still here?
Antonio? Baby! Where are you?
-lt's her boyfriend.
-lt's a very Co-dePendent relationshiP.
Well, at least l have a relationshiP.
What do you have? Nothing.
Antonio.
Teresa's gonna have to get baCk to you.
You Couldn't Possibly be talking about
my mother beCause she's allergiC to dogs.
-First rule: no Cell Phones.
-What?
No Pagers, no Palm Pilots and no e-mail.
And the telePhone downstairs may be used
in the event of emergenCies only.
Give it uP.
Send us baCk to the Stone Age,
why don't you?
You don't understand
what serious business this is.
ln order for us to do our job,
we're gonna need your CooPeration...
and that means Paying attention
to what l say...
and doing what l ask you to do
when l ask you to do it.
Furthermore, l'd aPPreCiate it
if you'd Cover yourselves in our PresenCe.
l realise how very Proud you are...
of your tattoos, PierCings,
and other body modifiCations.
However, my Colleagues and l
do not need to see these.
Are there any questions?
l have one. Are you always suCh a diCk?
Yes. There will be no guests
in the house ever.
Nobody may leave the house
without an esCort.
But this is our house.
What about Classes?
l'm in an advanCed Pre-med Program.
-l have a--
-4.0, we know.
Okay, guys. lf l miss my bioChem Class,
l'm gonna lose my sCholarshiP.
There are five of y'all, three of us.
You'll have to Pare your sChedules down
to the absolute essentials.
l'll skiP all my Classes
for the greater good of the grouP.
Work it out amongst yourselves.
-What about dates? Barb's got two tonight.
-Not anymore.
Hello! We've got a game on Saturday.
Don't even think about telling us
we're not going.
You're not going.
Don't say it.
As CaPtain of this squad, l must inform you
that to stoP us from Cheerleading...
you're gonna have to Pry the Pom-Poms
from our Cold, dead hands.
l'm all Clear.
Come on, Asst. Cheerleading CoaCh SharP,
show me your sPirit.
Where's your haPPy faCe?
This is my haPPy faCe.
Well, l think we're gonna have to turn
that frown uPside down.
Now this Cannot be how you helPed
Florida State to the regional finals.
-CoaCh Beauregard?
-Please, Binky.
Okay, Binky.
l sPeCialise in strength and Conditioning...
and l'm gonna leave the grinning
and the smiling uP to you.
Well, okey-dokey then.
Assignment aCCePted.
Tjme-out...
Texas.
Gun!
A water gun, sir.
Please don't hurt me. lt's just a joke.
NiCe hit!
CheCk it out.
Howdy, neighbour.
l'm Jimmy from next door.
Just wanted to Come by
and welCome you to the building.
And, you know,
if you need any weed or anything...
just Come bang on my door.
That's good to know, Jimmy.
-You'll definitely be hearing from us.
-Cool.
2200 hours.
HE-BAT js secure.
Roger that. We'll see y'all in the morning.
l don't sleeP.
lsn't that your Partner?
-Shouldn't you have gone to the hosPital?
-No.
l'm here.
Right. But she's been shot.
That's Part of the job.
You ever kill anyone, SharP?
Cold bastard Probably doesn't even Care.
Her middle name is Ellen.
A lot of the fellas weren't haPPy when
the Rangers started reCruiting women...
and l was sure enough one of them.
She Changed my mind.
l also hear everything.
''The brightness of her Cheek
would shame those stars
''As daylight doth a lamP
''her eyes in heaven
''Would through the airy region
stream so bright
''That birds would sing
and think it were not night''
So your assignment is
to write a five-Page PaPer...
due a week from Friday...
desCribing the funCtion
of the reCurrent imagery...
of light against darkness
in Romeo and Juljet.
What does it mean? How does it mean it?
And is it Possible that this Play...
is more than just a teenage romanCe
with a sad ending?
Miss ThomPson.
l want to see you in my offiCe. Now.
-She'd like to see you.
-What for?
l don't know.
Mr. SharP. Come in. Have a seat.
So, l understand you're
the new assistant Cheerleading CoaCh.
That's right.
May l ask what you were doing in my Class?
That's the way we do things on our squad.
lf somebody's in the--
Let me be blunt, Mr. SharP.
Barb's Cheerleading
is interfering with her work.
And for the reCord, you should know
l think Cheerleading is stuPid.
l Couldn't agree with you more.
She downloaded this PaPer
on Plant imagery in Macbeth...
off the lnternet.
l know, beCause l wrote it 20 years ago
when l was an undergraduate.
Must be a hell of a PaPer.
Yes, l thought it was Pretty good.
But that is not the Point.
Plagiarism is simPly not aCCePtable.
l've given Barb an F on that assignment.
lf she wants to remain on the squad,
or in the sChool, for that matter...
her next PaPer on Romeo and Juljet
had better be wholly original.
l'll exPlain your Position to Barb...
and make sure she understands it,
exPliCitly.
Well, good.
Fine.
Okay, what's the big deal?
Presidents don't write their sPeeChes.
When you're President, you Can be
as lenient as you want to on Plagiarism.
But wait. This Play has five aCts.
She Can't exPeCt me to read the whole thing.
lt's all written in ye olde
weird English anyway.
-Hey, Barb.
-Hi, SCoot.
Besides, PeoPle think being a Cheerleader
is this nonstoP Party and everything...
but, you know, they're so wrong.
-Hey, Barb.
-Hi, Chase.
Aside from all my games and my PraCtiCes...
they still exPeCt me to maintain
this 2.0 average, and l Can't do that.
You need to manage your time better.
Time? What time? l don't have any time.
-Hey, Barb.
-Hi, Tim.
-Tom.
-Shoot! Sorry. Tom.
l really liked him, too.
You got some admirers on this CamPus,
don't you?
Don't be jealous. They're just silly boys.
We Can stoP this Charade
and run away together.
You got a PaPer to write.
l know. But if l write it myself,
it'll just be stuPid.
You don't know that
beCause you haven't tried.
Cheating is a hell of a lot worse
than being stuPid.
Plagiarism is an aCademiC Crime.
lt is Punishable by aCademiC death.
What do you Care anyway?
l wanna see you stay alive, aCademiCally,
PhysiCally, and every other way.
-You like me, don't you?
-No.
Guys, stand by one moment.
Sergeant, your Pizza's here.
Roger that.
Set the Pizza on the PorCh...
take two stePs baCk,
and PlaCe your hands behind your head.
What's the Problem, dude?
lf that Pizza's hot,
there won't be any Problem.
-All right, what do l owe you?
-$13.75.
Hey, do you live here with all these girls?
TemPorarily.
Dude, you're my new hero.
lmagine what that means to me.
-Thank you.
-You're welCome.
Without my Phone, l am nothing,
l am worthless.
l need to sPeak to my Antonio....
-What is that?
-The Carnivore.
PePPeroni, sausage, ground beef, ham, and
olive loaf, all together in one savoury Pie.
With jalaPenos.
-Want some?
-Yes. No.
Extra-thiCk Crust.
-l Can't. l'm on the Zone.
-What zone?
The ProPer Combination
of Protein, fat, and Carbohydrates.
This Combination's ProPer as hell.
l'm a total Atkins girl.
l do Weight WatChers.
You'll Probably blow all your daily Points
with just one bite.
This baby has one Point and one Point only,
and that is tasting good.
l don't know why you girls are on a diet.
You Couldn't weigh any more than--
Don't even go there.
No, there are some things
we just don't disCuss.
My daughter has a very healthy aPPetite.
lnteresting. You never mentioned
you had a daughter.
-What's her name?
-Emma.
-How old is she?
-Seventeen.
-ls she a Cheerleader?
-l hoPe not.
-What's her favourite band?
-You got me.
How about her sign?
ls she sexually aCtive?
-Hell, no.
-She Probably is.
68%% of high-sChool students
in Texas have had sex...
by the time they've reaChed the 1 2th grade.
Slightly higher than the national average.
Thank you for ruining my day.
l'll tell you one thing about this daughter
you know nothing about.
She must be suPremely messed uP
in the head from living in a house with you.
She lives with her mother.
Why did your marriage fall aPart?
That's one of many things
that you and l will never disCuss.
You see, you Clearly don't know
how to sPeak to women.
l know how to sPeak to women.
l Clearly Choose not to.
We need to establish
this bathroom at the end of the hall...
is a 100%% masCuline bathroom.
From this moment on, it is off-limits to
you PeoPle and your foolish undergarments.
-You want an egg-white omelette?
-Does that mean no yolks?
-No yolks.
-No, thanks.
-Want some kamut flakes?
-What?
-AnCient grain. Tastes great with soymilk.
-Soymilk.
-Who ate all my kamut flakes?
-Not me.
What am l,
the Organisation to End World Hunger?
This is my Cereal.
Why do you girls find it neCessary
to listen to this Constant CraP?
You don't like vagina musiC?
Do you have to use that word
before l've had my Coffee and soymilk?
-Vagina.
-Whose?
-What did l tell y'all about wearing Clothes?
-Jog bras are Clothes.
That's it.
That is it.
Just sign right there.
-Awful big unit for a house this size.
-l get hot.
l hear you.
All right. You win, okay?
We all agree to Put on more Clothes.
Now, Can you Please
turn the temPerature uP?
That's a very mature deCision
and l'm Proud of you girls.
But we should Come
to a Common understanding...
the meaning, the definition
of the word ''more.''
We thought you might say that.
Barb!
All righty.
This is Courtney Ryan, my Personal hero.
Like Courtney, we feel we should not
be Penalised for maximising our assets.
However, we've all agreed to Cover uP...
these areas here...
and this area right here.
Good.
But what about these other Problem areas?
Here...
here...
and here.
You're killing me.
Come here.
All right. We'll Cave on the first two.
But we absolutely must maintain
navel visibility.
We want to be realistiC, not Amish.
-One inCh on either side.
-Three.
-Two.
-Done.
These gjrls are a djfferent kettle of Worms.
Something just Came uP. l'll get baCk to you.
l need to sPeak to your witnesses.
Eddie, how's the arm?
Let's not Change the subjeCt.
There are no witnesses.
Even if there was, l Couldn't let you
talk to them. You know that.
Come on, CaPtain,
we're on the same team here.
l think l Can helP.
At least let me talk to SharP.
That was him on the Phone, right?
SharP's in the field right now.
Right.
Your Ranger sCrewed uP my whole Case.
He blew uP that lab
and all the evidenCe in it.
Ball is dead
and l got shot in the arm, for Christ's sake.
l need to sPeak to those witnesses.
So l'm asking you again. Where are they?
This ''One Riot, One Ranger'' shit won't fly
when l slaP a subPoena on your desk.
My desk's already a mess.
One more PieCe of PaPer
won't make me no never mind.
CirCle the wagons if you want.
This is a federal Case.
-You learn quiCk.
-Five years of College.
$13.75, right? Here's $1 4. KeeP the Change.
How's my favourite PeP-squad leader?
What?
l said, how's my favourite
PeP-squad leader?
Not real PePPy.
Would somebody turn that musiC down?
Hang on, CaP.
ls there any more Pizza left?
Somebody, Please turn that musiC off!
Throw this away.
l Cannot hear myself think.
Okay, as we involuntarily enter
into this enforCed Period of silenCe...
Can l ask if there's any mediCation
you forgot to take...
or some l might reCommend you should try?
Yes. Like take a Chill Pill.
l only need one witness.
Get out.
What's uP, CaP?
lt's a subPoena from your buddy Zane.
The feds want our witnesses.
We're noW offjcjally jn contempt.
Don't worry. lf Cortland don't send
somebody to kill them soon, l'll do it myself.
One other thing.
l got this invoiCe here for an air Conditioner.
$7,572.44.
Can you exPlain that to me?
l'll have to get baCk to you on that one.
Where do you think you're going?
To the CaCtus Cafe.
AsleeP at the Wheel's Playing.
Too many PeoPle. You know the rules.
Nobody goes out after dark.
We're young, we're strong,
and we're tired of being CooPed uP.
l haven't had Phone sex with my boyfriend
in almost a week.
l have oats to Plow.
You got oats to sow,
and it ain't gonna haPPen.
Like hell it's not. What's to stoP me
from walking out that door? The Tontos?
l eat men like that for breakfast.
And what, you?
l'd like to see you try it, Mr. Ranger-man.
Come on.
Anybody else wanna go see
AsleeP at the Wheel?
You think he needs baCkuP?

You're looking for Jimmy.
Totally. Dude, are you like a PsyChiC

Some kind of shit.
The thing is...
Jimmy moved.
-Where to?
-Travis County Jailhouse.
That ain't good.
Okay, a hairdo this Phenomenal

with the world.
-What if we have to go to the bathroom?
-Go ahead.
You're evil, you know that?
FaCe it, girl. You're with me tonight.
We didn't ask for this.
We just went into the bathroom
and saw a guy die.
We Could've kePt quiet, but we didn't.
l feel like we're getting Punished for it.
-Sorry, but you're not being Punished.
-Then let us out of here.
Even Prisoners on death row
get a little yard time.
-How about the mall?
-ShoPPing with y'all? l don't think so.
-What about a movie?
-Not in the mood.
As CaPtain of the Cheerleading squad,
l demand that you take us somePlaCe...
where you Can ProteCt us
and we Can have some fun.
Look who's skating!
Last time l was here, it was Emma's
sixth birthday. She loved this PlaCe.
You don't sPeak to her muCh, do you?
l don't think Emma wants to talk to me.
Every girl wants to talk to her dad.
She may aCt like she doesn't, but she does.
Everything l say around her is wrong.
l've been wrong sinCe she turned 1 1 .
Maybe you're just not asking her
the right questions.
First of all, never ask, ''So how's sChool?''
NoPe. Dumb question. lt's too easy.
Our brains just shut off.
And don't beCome her best friend.
We have enough friends, thank you.
What do you wish you Could say to her?
That l wish l Could see her more...
and l'm sorry it didn't work out
between her mother and me...
and it wasn't her fault, and stuff like that.
lf my daddy told me them things,
l'd be the haPPiest girl alive.
l haven't seen my dad
sinCe he left me nine years ago.
l'm sorry that haPPened to you.
You have a daughter and you love her.
You should tell her.
Yeah, maybe you should take her
skating again, beCause you know what?
You're getting Pretty good.

All right, we're going to let you go.
Show us your funky groove. Come on, boy!

What are you doing here?
l'm looking for your father.
lt's a Professional matter.
You got any idea where l might find him?
No. He doesn't really tell me anything.
What haPPened to your arm?
lt's just one of the hazards of the job.
You wouldn't haPPen
to have a number on him, would you?
ls he in trouble?
No. lt's just that l'm working on a Case
and l need his helP.
lf l need to get ahold of him...

they PatCh me through on a restriCted line.
-l'll give that a try then.
-Okay.
-Good to see you again.
-Bye.
SharP, look here.
Remember that John Doe

Rifle from his trunk matChes the bullet

Can you get us home so we Can rest?
NoPe.
-Please?
-Come on.

Well, if it ain't Martin Luther Vandross.
Why don't you all take a break.
Everybody go ahead, real quiCk.
This man's Probably got
a lot of sins he needs to Confess.
Probably may have to exorCise him.
Y'all go about your business.
Can't you see

You know this guy?
l mean, that is....
He got roughed uP.
That is Pretty bad right there.
-ls he dead?
-He way dead.
Yeah, l mean, looks like a guy
that was in the Can with me.
Think his name's JaCk Carter.
He work for Cortland?
No. He was more of a freelanCe artist...
if you know what l'm saying.
Looks like Cortland hired a seCond shooter.
Pull uP JaCk Carter, see what we got on him.
So, you girls are Cheerleaders, huh?
Y'all reCognise me? lt's me, PerCy.

Hey, Emma, it's your father.

Just working on a Case.
Anyway, l'd like to talk to you.
So Call me. You know how to reaCh me.

There's no Pressure or anything like that.
You know.
-So l guess that's it.
-Tell her you miss her.
ExCePt, l miss you, baby.
Can l helP you?
Teresa had a visit from her little friend.
What did l tell you PeoPle about visitors?
Not that kind of visitor. Her menses.
-The Curse of Eve. The Crimson tide.
-l get it.
So, someone has to go shoPPing.
Do you want me to go?
Holt, get over here.
I'm gojng out for some ajr.
Attentjon.
Prjce check on regjster three, please.
Can't make uP your mind?
Do l need the slim fit, the regular ProteCtion
or the one with wings?
The ones with the wings. Definitely.
CuCumber-melon body sPray.
Vanilla-smoothie bikini Cream.
Sounds like a busy and Painful night
for your wife.
l'm divorCed. These are for the girls.
The Cheerleaders?
You do their shoPPing for them?
You are a Curious fella, Mr. SharP. You gay?
No. Girls are all tied uP, studying.
l volunteered to helP out
and PiCk uP a few things.
Are you sleePing with any
or Possibly all of these girls?
No.
Wanna have dinner with me
tomorrow night?
Negative.
-Negative?
-lt's not really Possible, with work and all.
Well, okay, that Plane just flew
into the side of the mountain.
Call off the searCh, no survivors.
Have a Pleasant evening.
These yours?
-Yes.
-You left them on the Counter.
Thank you.
Thank you.
l think l made a mistake baCk there.
Didn't want the wings after all?
No. ln regard to dinner.
lt's not that l don't want to.
lt's hard for me to get away
with my busy sChedule...
as an assistant Cheerleading CoaCh.
This whole Cheerleading thing
must be a really tough raCket.
You have no idea.
Anyway, l was thinking...
maybe you Could Come over
to the house tomorrow and l'll fix dinner.
Okay.
-8:00?
-Yeah, good.
By the way, l'm Molly.
l'm Roland.
You're not on the Zone or Counting Points
or anything like that, are you?
No.
ls that the North Star?
No. l think that's an airPlane.
You see the way it's moving?
That's the North Star.
So that's where they've been keePing it.
Someday l want to do more
than look at the stars.
l'm fixing to soar with them.
What, you mean,
like an astronaut or something?
No, not exaCtly. Not a living one, at least.
They got this ComPany out of Beaumont...
and they will launCh your remains
right out into outer sPaCe.
Really? l love shit like that.
-But how?
-What they do is they Park you--
Holt, what the hell are you doing?
ContemPlating the vastness
of the universe, sir.
lt's suPPosed to be red.
Does this look like red to you?
Just shoot her, SharP.
You'd be doing her a favour.
-Where are Teresa and Anne?
-l don't know.
You're lying.
-How do you know?
-You broke eye ContaCt.
lt's a sign of stress and Possible deCePtion.
So is PiCking at your Clothes.
StoP PiCking at your Clothes.
Look me in the eye
and tell me where they're at.
Teresa and Antonio had a really big fight.
She had to blow off some steam,
so they went to the Buffalo Billiards.
You stay here.
Don't be ContemPlating the universe
with anybody.
Look, a native aPProaChes.
Avoid eye ContaCt.
You guys are the Cheerleaders, right?
The ones with the Calendar?

June kiCks ass.
Sorry, wrong girl.
Well, me and my buddies over there,

Personnel suPPressor? You mean killing?
Can't you just wound them or something?
Shoot the gun out of their hand?
No, it's imPossible.
You're not really the Cheerleading tyPe,
are you?
For me, it's more PenanCe than a Passion.
Religious asCetiCs wear a hair shirt,
l Carry the Pom-Poms.
l don't know.
l guess it's the duality of man, you know?
''That Jungian thing, sir.''

She likes the guy on the saddle

ExCuse me, a woman is not a horse.
Just be yourself.
l'm not so sure being himself
is going in the right direCtion.
Okay. Just be yourself,

Be the you who you would be

-Somebody better.
-That's what l mean. Somebody better.
-Maybe we ought to Call this off.

But we're not. We're Cheerleaders.
And we're going to the Hex Rally.

-No.
That's beCause you still don't get it.

All Cheerleaders.
See, you're a negative Person, SharP.
Cheerleading is all about the Positive.
Our job is to insPire, suPPort and eleCtrify.
Any fool Can feel good
when you're winning.
But when you're down 27 Points
in the fourth quarter...
that's when you got to ask yourself,
''Who you gonna Call?''
l might Call Halle Berry.
Hey, Longhorns.

Any fool can feel good

But When you're doWn 27 pojnts

''Who you gonna call?''
I tell you Who I'm gojng to call,

Prajse the Lord and pass the ammunjtjon!
Okay, now Can l get a witness?
This man has got the sPirit.
Swear to God, l thought
he was gonna start sPeaking in tongues.
What about ''Platform of Positivity''?
l was gonna do a Cartwheel,
but didn't want to steal the limelight.
l think SharP just made a joke.
lt's more of a jaPe or a jest,
but still, it's Progress.
-Can we go to the Party?
-Negatjvo, baby.
Please. When are you guys
gonna get over yourselves?
Nobody, l rePeat, nobody is trying to kill us.
Get out of this van, right now! Let's go.
