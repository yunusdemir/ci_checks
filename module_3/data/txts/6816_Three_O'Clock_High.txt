[Students Chattering]
I'm telling you, this new guy's
supposed to be a total psycho.
I heard he broke another kid's neck
at his last school.
He got kicked off the football
team for pulling a knife on a coach.
All the coach did was grab him,
and the guy goes nuts!
This guy's coming
to our school?
Today.
After he broke that kid's neck,
they tried to throw him in jail.
The judge let him off.
This guy ought to
be locked up.
Did you hear what he did at Lincoln?
They were supposed to be
dissecting these sand sharks.
He refused to do it. He said
sharks were his favorite animal.
Great. A psychotic
shark lover.
So the teacher grabs him...
and tries to take him
to the office.
The teacher didn't know
the guy was a touch freak.
Touch freak?
Yeah. He doesn't
like to be touched by anybody.
Put the teacher
in the hospital for three days.
<i>Just because he touched him?
This guy is definitely on tilt.
[Girl] Guys!</i>
That's not even the whole story.
After he duked the science teacher,
they send the dude
into Continuation.
On the first day, he got into a fight
with the three baddest dudes.
Seriously totaled
their asses...
at the same time!
Have you heard about
his brass knuckles?
Brass knuckles?
Yeah. Uses them on
special occasions.
He hit that Continuation dude...
...so hard his nose
flew off his face.
Seriously?
Totally serious.
He's also got this thing
about being touched.
I heard he broke a guy's neck
just because he touched him.
Because he touched him?
He didn't like
to be touched.
That's completely weird.
Does this guy
play football?
No.
Good.
Used to. Remember the guy who
pulled a knife on his coach?
Yeah.
That's him.
Jesus.
He was in Continuation.
He took a swing at one
of his teachers.
These guys aren't your
average history types.
They're like ex-cops.
I heard they carry guns.
He came here
from Continuation?
Uh-huh. That's why they
call it Continuation:
so you can continue murdering
people and still graduate.
<i>What's this guy's name,
anyway?
[Car Engine Revving]</i>
His name's Buddy Revell.
Good morning, Jerry.
Hi, Mr. Rice.
All right, now.
We got pens,
and we got plastic tabs.
<i>All you have to do is sign
right above my name, right here.</i>
How we doin' this week?
Oh, we're doin'
really great.
Over $470.
That's terrific. We must be doin'
something right, hmm?
Uh, listen, that's a lot of cash.
I suggest you take it over and
deposit it after school today.
All right?
I'll see you later.
I gotta chalk the sidelines for
theJ.V. game this afternoon.
That's terrific.
You know, we could have
a great party with all that money.
Mom and Dad aren't
gonna be back until tomorrow.
Grand theft, Brei.
Just kidding. Besides,
grand theft is only
if you steal more than $500.
Excuse me.
Hi. Can l...
Help me?
I'd like some notebook paper.
Paper?
Any kind in particular?
<i>I could show you something
in standard, or a nice
college rule model.</i>
Legal pads, steno pads,
spiral pad, uh...
Just regular white
will be fine.
[Sighs]
White. Right. Good choice.
And a pen?
A pen. You won't believe
what just came in.
It's this new pen
from Wright Brothers.
It has this amazing flow system.
When you're doing homework in bed...
and you're writing upside down
and the ink stops flowing?
<i>This pen...
I don't do homework
in bed.</i>
Oh. Yeah. Mm.
How about a Bic?
That's fine.
I think I gave you a five.
Ohh.
[Register Rattles]
<i>[Banging, Rattling]</i>
<i>It's okay, really.
I'll pick it up later.</i>
No, no.
l... I have it right here.
It's okay, really.
Looks like it's gonna be
one of those days, Jerry.
<i>[Bell Ringing]</i>
I take it you heard.
It's a little general,
Vincent.
Buddy Revell.
The guy's the closest thing
to Charlie Manson
ever seen at Weaver.
<i>This could be a big story
for the Titan. We could be
talking major literary awards.</i>
You want to do an article
about this guy for the paper?
Yeah. Maybe one of those
new student profiles.
Up close, personal.
Get some insights into
who he is as a human being.
You're sick, Vincent.
No, no!
This guy's news.
He's never lost a fight, ever.
He's got a perfect record.
Yeah, but Brei told me he broke
some kid's neck atJefferson.
<i>Yeah.
Isn't it great?
[Bell Ringing]</i>
Before I assign the articles
for next week's issue, there's
something I want to talk about.
There's a new student on campus
today. Buddy Revell.
<i>We've all heard the stories
about Buddy,</i>
but I think we should make him
feel welcome here at Weaver...
rather than alienating him,
which seems to have been
the policy at his previous schools.
So Vincent and I have decided that
we should do a "welcome aboard" piece,
which has been assigned to...
Jerry Mitchell.
<i>Now, Susan...
[Jerry]
Mrs. Phillips?</i>
May I go to the restroom, please?
<i>[Tapping]</i>
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
Um, excuse me.
Hi. l... I'm Jerry Mitchell.
I'm with the school paper.
<i>The Titan.</i>
l... I know this is a little
weird, me asking who you are...
standing side-by-side
in front of the urinals.
If you're a fag...
Oh, God. Uh, me?
N-No way.
<i>[Zipping]</i>
What I'm trying to find out is,
you are Buddy Revell, right?
[Tapping]
You a narc?
No. I'm with
the school paper.
What do you want, man?
I just got to this school.
I don't want anything.
Th-That is, all I want to do
is talk to you. See?
They told me to write this
stupid little piece because
you're the new kid on campus.
You're gonna do a stupid
little piece on me?
<i>Why would I want
to look stupid?
No, no, no.</i>
You're not gonna look stupid.
N-Not at all.
And, incidentally, just so you know,
I don't care if you do
all kinds of dope and shit.
I'm not anybody's narc,
you know?
Not that I think that you do dope
or anything like that. I mean...
Shit. Listen.
Why don't we forget this whole thing
and pretend this never happened, okay?
You're never gonna forget
this happened.
[Flushing]
I want you to understand
something, Jerry.
I don't like it
when people know about me.
In fact, I don't like it
when anybody knows about me.
So you can take that newspaper
and wipe off your dick with it.
You made me mad, Jerry.
- Now I'm gonna have to do
something to work it off.
- Work it off?
You and me, we're gonna have
a fight today, after school.
3:00 in the parking lot.
You try and run,
I'm gonna track you down.
You go to a teacher,
it's only gonna get worse.
You sneak home,
I'm gonna be under your bed.
You and me.
3:00.
<i>[Stall Door Opens]</i>
<i>[Clock Ticking Loudly]</i>
You okay, Jer?
Uh-huh.
Look, Jerry,
about that article...
I just talked to him.
Who?
Him.
"Him" as in Buddy Revell "him"?
Great. What did he say?
He wants to fight me today
at 3:00 in the parking lot.
You didn't touch him,
did you, Jer?
Oh, this isn't good, Jerry.
This is not good.
Jerry, something
is happening inside you.
Buddy Revell's just
challenged him to a fight.
When?
Today.
3:00, in the parking lot.
I'll get in touch with Ethan.
He'll know what to do.
Ethan?
He's my spirit guide.
He lived long ago.
Now he advises me
from the beyond.
Oh. Good idea.
Well, look. W-We're
not gonna need Ethan...
because there's not
gonna be a fight.
I'm just gonna talk
to Buddy Revell and tell him
that there's no reason to fight.
That's all there is to it.
Nobody has to know.
Jerry Mitchell?
I heard you're gonna fight
Buddy Revell after school today.
No, there's not...
Are you a black belt or
something? You look small.
Well, good luck.
Man,
word travels fast.
<i>[Clock Ticking]</i>
<i>[Bell Rings]</i>
Uh, excuse me again.
I don't deal with you
until 3:00.
See, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.
There's really no reason
for you and I to fight,
because I'm not gonna do
that piece anymore.
I know you're not,
'cause I told you
I don't like people...
knowin' about me.
Listen to me,
you little shit.
<i>You and me are gonna fight...</i>
at 3:00,
and there is nothing
you can do about it.
<i>- But...

Jerry Mitchell.
Heard about your
little problem, Mitchell.
What problem?
With Buddy Revell.
As I'm sure you know...
Bruce and I are planning to go
to film school at UCLA.
But we can get a head start if
we did a documentary on your fight.
The events leading up to it.
Your feelings as your friends desert you.
How you handle your defeat.
You want to follow me and film
Buddy Revell kicking my ass?
Exactly, but we're not talking
schlock here. We're talking classy angles.
Private moments. Feelings.
What do you think?
No.
Did you say "no"?
Yes.
We're talking about
making you a star.
Scott, Bruce, Jerry. Sit.
Mr. Medved, I'm really sorry
about being late.
Sit.
Think about it, Mitchell.
## [Lighthearted Soundtrack]
I heard you're
gonna fight Buddy Revell.
- Well, actually...
- Ever been in a fight before?
- No.
- Mmm.

Uh... 46, 32, 15.
46, 32, 15
Vince, what are you doing?
This is Buddy Revell's locker.
I know.
What's 46, 32, 15?
- His combination.
- Vince, stop.
Calm down.
I got a plan.
I want you to stop!
What kind of a plan?
This plan.
You want me to stab him?
Are you crazy?
Of course not.
I'm gonna plant this sucker
in his locker. Then I'm gonna
leave a note on O'Rourke's desk.
They find the blade,
Buddy's out of the school before lunch.
How'd you get the combination?
I memorized it while you
were talking in the hall.
I guess he doesn't plan
on doing much homework.
- Vince, close the locker.
- Right.
What the hell
are you doing?
Saving your ass?
Open it. Open the damn locker
and get the knife out. Now!
What's your problem?
This plan is gonna work.
Besides, I already planted
the note in O'Rourke's desk.
Don't you get it? He'll know
that we were involved.
He'll know that I planted it.
Who else wants him kicked out
of school as much as me?
You know what?
I think you're getting
just a little paranoid.
You see that clock?
Mm-hmm.
We have about one minute
to get that knife out of there...
before this hallway's full of people,
including Buddy Revell!
Okay, maybe you're right.
Um, what was
that combination again?
You just said it
six million times.
Um, I remember it.
Uh...
- We've got 30 seconds.
- Forty-six!
- Twenty seconds.
- Thirty-two.
- Ten seconds.
- You wouldn't happen to
remember the last number?
Vince, don't do this to me.
Five seconds!
Twenty-five.
<i>[Bell Rings]</i>
Maybe he won't figure it out.
There's always that chance.
Look, I'm gonna try and get
the note during pep assembly.
I'll see you at lunch.
Okay?
[Students Chattering]
Don't be an asshole.
Just ditch. Go. Leave.
Brei, it's not that simple.
I have a book report
due in the fifth period.
I have a math quiz in the sixth.
If I leave, I flunk both.
Listen, Jerry.
Being flunked beats being dead.
[Students Yelling]
It's been quite a morning, Jerry.
- You can say that again.
- Quite a morning.
I've made contact with Ethan.
Ethan's very concerned about you.
Mm-hmm.
But don't worry.
He says you're a warrior,
and that there is a chance
that you will emerge
from this challenge unscathed.
What sort of a chance
does Ethan figure I have?
- That depends.
- On what?
- On us.
- Franny, I know he's
your guardian angel...
Jerry, this is no joke.
It's time for you and I to bond.

This is not a movie. This is my life!
Oh, come on, man.
Pain is temporary. Film is forever.
[Starter Clicks, Fails]
This guy's crazy.
Where you headin' for,
son?
Uh, nowhere, really.
Looks to me like you were
heading off campus.
You got a pass?
No, sir. I was having a problem with
my car, and I thought I might get help.
Why didn't you go
to the office, boy?
Uh, the office. I don't know why
I didn't think of that.
I'll head over there.
Thanks for the help.
Get in. I'll take you.
That's okay.
I can make it on my own.
I said come with me!
<i>I'm doggin'you,
you little punk!</i>
Frisk, son!
What have we got here?
That's not my knife.
See this note?
Another kid was...
Shh!
You can explain it all
to Mr. Dolinski. Come on.
Caught this one trying to ditch
during the rally.
After routine search
for narcotics, I found this.
Thank you, Duke.
I'll take it from here.
Yes, sir.
You tell all your little friends
there's no escapin' the Duker.
You got that? Hmm?
Y-Yes.
Good.
I don't think I've had you
in my office before.
- Jerry Mitchell, sir.
- [Growling, Gunshots, Screaming]
No, I don't think I've been
in your office before.
Eva, I'll need the file
on Jerry Mitchell.
<i>[Woman On Intercom]
Right away, Mr. D.</i>
I really don't think there's
any reason to put this in my file, sir.
What were you going to do
with the blade, Jerry?
Well, you see,
it's really not my knife.
Buddy Revell wants to fight me
at 3:00 in the parking lot,
and I couldn't get out of it.
So a friend... Well, I had this really
stupid idea that I might be able...
to get Buddy kicked out
before I had to fight him.
So I planted the knife in his locker
and put a note on Mr. O'Rourke's desk.
Only he found out about
the knife before you guys did,
and he stuck it in my mom's
steering wheel with a note
that I could never get away.
<i>But like I said,
it's really not my knife.</i>
That is absolutely
the most ridiculous excuse
I have ever heard...
in my entire career
as a disciplinarian, Jerry.
<i>But it's true.
[Phone Dial Clicking]</i>
Hello, Bill. Voytek. Did you receive
a note regarding the contents...
of Buddy Revell's locker?
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>
They haven't found a note
anywhere near his office.
<i>But...
[Door Opens]</i>
Jerry Mitchell's file,
Mr. D.
Thank you, Eva.
This can't be right.
Not one single unexcused absence
in three years?
<i>That's very hard to believe.</i>
I'm telling you the truth, sir.
I wouldn't leave school
without a good reason.
I'm not quite sure
what's going on here, Mitchell.
But I want you to understand something.
I've dealt with students like you before.
You put on a good front
for a couple of years,
and suddenly you think you can
get away with bloody murder.
I'm going to be watching you...
from now on.
And if I hear
even a peep from you,
be assured your college
acceptance boards will hear from me.
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir. Yes.
<i>[Bell Rings]</i>
Here.
Well, open it.
"Dear Mr. O'Rourke.
Earlier today I spotted Buddy Revell...
"placing a large switchblade
in his locker.
"I feel it is my duty
as an honorable student...
"to alert you of this dangerous
and felonious situation.
Sincerely, Jerry Mitchell."
You put my name on the note?
There's no reason to get
pissed. It's over now.
Besides, I got the note
before O'Rourke even saw it.
Oh, Jesus.
Hey. You Jerry Mitchell?
Yeah.
Oh, perfect. You heard that the
guys in the accounting club...
have come up with these pools.
Pools?
Betting pools on your fight
this afternoon.
What?
I was wondering
if you could try...
and make the fight last
longer than three minutes.
You could do a lot of footwork
and shit,
or maybe just run away
or something.
'Cause my bet is that you'll last
three or more minutes with Buddy.
And I got faith in you, man.
I think you're solid.
You guys are making bets
on the fight? Taking odds
on my destruction?
That's obscene.
You're right. I wouldn't
make that bet if I were you.
Hey, Jerry.
Do you cut easy?
'Cause there's good odds
going in the stitches category.
- Stitches category?
- Yeah. It's something the
accounting club came up with.
You bet on how many stitches
it's gonna take to fix Jerry's face.
Whoa! Save it for the fight!
Remember, three minutes. Heavy.
Vince, all hell is breaking
loose over this thing.
I have to convince Buddy Revell
we can't fight today.
That approach
didn't work out
too well last time.
Why didn't I think
of this sooner?
Think of what?
Vince, you got to
help me out with this.
Help you with what?
Find out where Craig Mattey
is next period. Then get me
out of Western Civ.
How am I supposed to do that?
You're the editor.
You'll think of something.
What do you want
with Craig?
Just get me out.
I have to talk to him
before lunch.
Achilles struck Hector
in the throat with his spear.
His body spewed blood
in all directions.
[Chuckles]
The crowd roared with pleasure.
The moment of truth had come.
<i>[Alarm Ringing]</i>
Good job, Vince. Did you find out
what class Craig was in?
Ceramics, but he's probably
headed to the track by now.
<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>
<i>[Man] Move along.
Stay with your classes.</i>
Off the track.
Come on. Come on.
Vince, boost me up.
Come on.
There he is!
Let me down.
Hi, Craig.
Do you remember me?
I'm Jerry Mitchell. I helped you with
math homework in the sixth grade.
[Sighs]
Yeah, I guess.
Listen, can I talk to you for
a minute? Alone?
If you're a fag...
No! No.
I just need your advice
on something.
All right.
What do you want?
Well, I have this problem
with Buddy Revell.
What kind of problem?
Actually, he wants to
beat me up after school.
That's a big problem.
I know. I'm...
Well, I also remember
that a couple of years ago...
you stuck up forJimmy Hawkins.
You beatJeff Stevens' ass that day,
and I was wondering maybe...
you might be able to
help me out this afternoon.
Jimmy Hawkins had asthma.
Well, I have hypoglycemia.
He also paid me a hundred bucks
to take on Stevens.
A hundred bucks!
[Sighs]
Well, how much would you
charge me for Buddy Revell?
Four-fifty.
$450!
That's a 350% markup.
Inflation, man.
I'm just trying to do you
a favor.
Wait, wait,
wait a minute.
[Sighs]
If I can get the money,
do you think you'd do it
for me?
[Sighs]
Revell will never
bother you again.
Guaranteed.
Great. Oh, great.
Listen, you'll have the money before
the end of the fire drill.
Okay.
[Register Clatters]
[Clattering]
[Extinguisher Spraying]
[Register Whirs]
All right, people,
you may return
to your classes.
This has been a false alarm.
Let me assure you,
whoever is responsible,
I'm going to find you.
Hey, Craig?
You got the cash?
Could we talk about this alone?
It's all here, $450.
But you can't tell anybody
that I paid you to do this.
You think I want Dolinski
on my ass?
Don't worry about it.
This is business.
No one needs to know.
Okay, great.
When are you gonna do it?
Lunch is always
the best time.
A lot of confusion.
Takes the teachers a while to
figure what the hell's going on.
Don't worry about it.
Should be no problem.
[Ticking]
<i>Even as Hector begged for mercy,</i>
Achilles lashed him to his chariot...
and dragged Hector
around the city,
finally leaving his body
to be mutilated by wild dogs.
[Teacher Chuckles]
Hector's destiny
had finally come to...
Excuse me, Lorraine.
I must speak toJerry Mitchell
immediately.
What has happened here is so heinous,
I almost can't bear to show it to you.
I can take it.
Oh, God.
It isn't just vandalism, Jerry.
We're talking
about grand theft. Look.
Look at this.
Our weekly earnings are gone.
But I thought grand theft
was if you stole $500 or more.
This is so stupid.
Why would anybody...
do something like this?
Goddamn it!
Maybe it was some sort
of freak accident.
Accident?
[Chuckles]
You gotta be kidding me.
Look at the place.
Look at it!
It's no accident.
As far as I am concerned,
whoever did this is a criminal.
Whoever did this should be
plucked out of our school...
like a burgeoning cancerous
growth deep inside the colon.
I couldn't agree
with you more, sir.
G-Go on.
<i>[Clock Ticking]</i>
Geez, man. I lost you on the field.
What happened with Craig?
He said he'd do it.
Did I tell you
you were gonna live?
When's he gonna do it?
Lunch.
That's unbelievable! We gotta see this.
I gotta see this. Come on!
How you doin', Buddy?
- Do I know you?
- Played football against each other.
Oh, right.
You were the puss
who always bled.
I hear you're givin'
Jerry Mitchell a hard time.
Yeah.
It's gonna get even harder.
You...
aren't gonna do shit to him.
- Asshole.
- [Bone Snapping]
Shh.
[Gasping]
[Retching]
[Toilet Gurgles,
Doesn't Flush]
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
Your face looks
like nonfat milk.
Thanks.
Did Mr. Hypoglycemia
eat any lunch?
No.
Looks like you can
forget about breakfast too.
So Buddy Revell kicked
Craig Msattey's ass?
He broke his face...
literally.
At least we got your money back.
Where'd you get $450?
<i>You got the money back?
Yeah.</i>
Craig felt bad knowin' you were
gonna get it even worse.
<i>Anyway, he said he was
gonna give me all of it,</i>
but I told him he deserved
a hundred for his trouble.
You gave him $100?
You didn't get all of it back?
<i>Well, no.
Not all of it.</i>
The guy got two teeth punched out,
not to mention a broken finger!
Shit, Vincent,
I need that money!
Don't get pissed at me.
It's not my fault you hired
Craig to beat up Buddy Revell.
Not your fault?
This whole thing is your fault.
<i>If you wouldn't have
given me that assignment,
I wouldn't be puking...</i>
while I wait to have my face
rearranged by a psychopath!
You didn't have to touch Revell
in the bathroom, did you?
<i>- Did I tell you to do that?
- Get outta here.
Just get outta here!</i>
You always have an excuse.
Just admit that you set me up. Admit it!
Look, l...
Screw you, man!
Here.
Take your suckin' blood money.
So you stole the 450 bucks
from the student store, huh?
I still don't understand
why you didn't just leave.
<i>I already tried.
Dolinski nailed me.</i>
[Sighs]
Besides, I can't leave today.
I'm under suspicion for possessing
a concealed weapon.
<i>What?
Oh, never mind.</i>
I'm tellin' you,
there's no way out.
<i>Remember how last summer
we used to watch Gunsmoke
reruns three times a day?</i>
Brei, what does that have
to do with anything?
Whenever a guy wanted to get out of
a showdown, what did he do?
I don't know. He got himself
thrown into jail, I guess.
Exactly. What class
do you have next period?
English. I have to do
a book report.
That's perfect.
Do whatever you have to do,
but don't leave that class
without getting detention.
You get detention after school,
nobody'll expect you
to show up for the fight...
and not even Buddy'll be able
to touch you.
<i>[Clock Ticking]</i>
<i>[Woman]
All right.</i>
We're going to try and get through
as many book reports as we can today.
Are there any volunteers?
Yo.
Jerry.
All right. Go ahead.
Let me ask you a question.
<i>Why am I standing here?</i>
<i>I mean, the whole point
of books is that you read them.</i>
Uh, the minute you start telling people
about them. That means
they didn't read them.
<i>Which means that book reports
contribute to illiteracy,
which is a real social problem.</i>
Jerry, did you
actually read a book?
<i>Would you gimme a break?
Well, could we...</i>
- I'm tryin' to make
a point here.
- Jerry...
You don't think I could
tell you about a book I read?
Is that what you think?
[Laughs]
<i>Jerry. The book.</i>
Fine. The book.
<i>Honey Goes to Hollywood.</i>
[Coughs]
It's a good read.
Fast,
angry, sexual.
<i>I was, uh...</i>
<i>I was thinkin'about the syntax
and how it affected the overall mood.</i>
Particularly during the more...
expository passages.
The fifth chapter...
where Honey meets the whole
Australian soccer team.
<i>In fact, I gotta tell ya,</i>
it kinda made me
think of you, Miss Farmer.
<i>There I was, in bed,
reading my book,</i>
Honey's adventures gripping
my imagination.
<i>I just knew I had to tell you about
a book that was this good.</i>
Hey, Mama.
Jerry, I hope
this is going somewhere.
It's going somewhere.
[Sizzling]
What's your favorite book,
Miss Farmer?
What's
the difference?
It's important to me.
<i>The Turn of the Screw.
What a coincidence.</i>
Now, that's what I call
a book report.
<i>[Clock Ticking]</i>
Are we feeling more
like ourselves, Mr. Mitchell?
<i>I understand you managed
to avoid lunch today.</i>
Not very smart for somebody
who's hypoglycemic.
- Cobbler?
- No, thank you.
<i>Did Miss Farmer tell you where I'm
supposed to report for detention?</i>
Detention? She didn't mention
anything about detention.
<i>But she did want me to tell you
your book report was the best
she had in any ofher classes.</i>
- What?
- She said if you don't make it
back to class today...
she would like you to call her
at home this evening: here's her number.
You mean I'm not gonna
have detention after school?
Why, no. You can go back to class
as soon as you feel well enough.
Jerry. Hi.
How you feeling?
I heard about what happened
in Miss Farmer's class.
<i>Already?
Listen,</i>
I'm having a party tomorrow
night and I was wondering
if you'd like to come.
I'll try to make it.
I really will.
Great.
See you tomorrow night.
<i>[Flicking Sound]</i>
Hello, Jerry.
<i>Franny,
what are you doing here?</i>
Don't you see?
This is the perfect place.
The... perfect place?
<i>For us to bond.</i>
Oh, Franny, this...
this isn't such a good idea.
Why not?
Today's been the worst day
of my entire life,
and I don't think that...
bonding on a display table
is gonna help much.
<i>It will help, Jerry.</i>
Um...
M-Maybe I can think
of something else.
Um...
See you later?
Mr. Rice.
What are you doing here?
<i>I think I should be asking you
that question, Jerry.</i>
I was just...
I was just feeling a little low about
all that's happened in here,
<i>and I thought I might come by
and clean up a little bit.</i>
- Who is this kid?
- Jerry Mitchell.
I'm the student manager.
Mm-hmm.
Jerry, this is
Lieutenant Mulvahill,
Juvenile Division,
Sheriff's department.
<i>[Bell Rings]</i>
Better get
back to class, huh?
Yeah.
I just want you to know...
I have a strong suspicion
this was an inside job.
Almost always is.
Can I go now?
Yeah.
You can go.
[Ticking]
<i>[Guy] Like a lonely gunfighter
he stands alone,</i>
<i>his face etched with tension,
his eyes filled with fear...</i>
as he waits for the inevitable bell
of death to ring.
[Ringing]
[Chattering]
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
<i>[Man] All right, take a seat
over there byJerry Mitchell.</i>
<i>All right, people.</i>
As you know, we're having
a review quiz today.
Buddy, this shouldn't be
too difficult for you.
It's a review of
the last two chapters.
See where you left off
in your old school.
[Ticking]
You know how I feel about
cheating, Jerry. I despise it.
<i>Let's go.
Both of you! Now!</i>
All right. Which one of you...
gentlemen want to explain this?
Jerry?
I hate to admit it, sir,
but I was completely lost
in the quiz. You see...
I was cheating off of Buddy.
Do you expect me
to believe that?
Yes, sir.
You two boys must think
I'm very stupid.
But I believe you.
It's simple, Buddy.
<i>All I want you to do is to complete
two problems from this quiz.</i>
You get them right, I'll know you boys
are telling the truth.
<i>Get them both wrong...</i>
we've got a problem.
Let's go, Buddy.
They're both right.
You knew the answers
all along.
Can I go now?
I'm disappointed in you, Jerry.
It's clear to me Buddy came to
this school trying to make an effort.
And here, on his first day,
you've taken advantage of him.
I'm sorry, sir.
I also want you to know...
that I'm aware of both the incident
in the student store...
and your felonious possession
of a concealed weapon.
<i>This could mark the beginning
of a very dangerous trend
in your scholastic career,</i>
a trend that could have
a severe effect on your future.
<i>I'm going to be
watching you, Jerry.</i>
This isn't over yet.
No, sir. I know it isn't.
Hey, Buddy? Can I talk to you
for a minute?
You really blew O'Rourke away
in there, you know?
I know you really didn't need
my test answers or anything,
but I kinda got the feeling like,
I don't know,
like we were a team in there.
I mean, maybe we could just
forget this whole fight thing
and be friends or something.
What do you think?
You're never gonna learn,
are you?
What do you mean?
I mean, no matter
what you say or what you do,
you and me are gonna fight
when that bell rings at 3:00.
<i>Can't we be friends?
Can't we even try?</i>
I don't need friends.
Hey, wait a minute.
I can't fight you.
<i>I don't know how to fight
somebody like you.</i>
<i>Hey, do ya hear me?
I can't do it!</i>
What if I paid you?
Would you back off then?
<i>Look, I have $350.</i>
It's yours if you leave me alone.
- O'Rourke put you up to this?
- O'Rourke has nothing to do with this.
Just to call off the fight?
No catches?
No catches.
All right. You live.
Swear to God?
You're not gonna trash me?
But you know what, Mitchell?
You're the biggest pussy
I've ever met in my life.
You didn't even try.
How's that feel?
I want my money
back.
No refunds.
I'm not kiddin', man.
I want it back now!
Or what?
I'm no pussy, asshole.
The fight is on. You and me
in the parking lot, 3:00.
<i>[Clock Ticking]</i>
Jerry,
get back in your seat.
Flunk me.
<i>[Clock Ticking]</i>
<i>[Bell Rings]</i>
[Students Chattering]
[Students Cheering]
[Cheering Continues]
All right.
Hold it right there, gentlemen.
<i>There isn't going to be
any fight today!
[Students Booing]</i>
Break it up, people.
Go on home. Go on!
I said "move," gentlemen.
Jerry, I'm taking you home.
Buddy, go to my office
and wait for me there.
Sorry, Mr. O'Rourke.
I just can't do that.
Really?
Why don't I give you
a little help?
<i>[Students Murmur]</i>
[Students Gasp]
<i>[Scattered Cheering, Applause]</i>
There. Now it's your turn.
<i>[Students Gasp]</i>
<i>You leave him alone,
you maniac!</i>
You want him, you go through me,
you goddamn animal!
You hear me? You just go ahead
and go through me!
Move!
Come on, you asshole!
Come on, you peckerhead,
let's see what you got!
[Students Gasp]
<i>[Dolinski]
Move, move, move!
Move, move, move, move!</i>
You're not done
over here, pussy!
Let's finish.
[Cheering]
<i>[Students] Let's go!
Come on. Let him have it!</i>
Jerry! Stick him, Jerry!
You can do it!
Shit! Three minutes!
Go, Jerry! Three minutes!
[Panting]
<i>[Guy]
Come on. Let him have it!</i>
<i>[Students Gasp]</i>
[Yelling]
Jerry, Jerry,
are you all right?
Cripple the dick!
[Students Moan]
Kill him, Jer!
- Break his face!
- Rip his head off!
Don't fuck this up,
Mitchell!
No one's gonna help you now.
It's just you and me!
[Students Cheering]
[Students Cheering]
[Students]
Oooh!
<i>[Siren Wails]</i>
You may have saved yourself
for the time being, Mr. Mitchell,
but we still have a matter
of $450 to discuss.
Get the Revell boy.
I want to talk to him too.
- He's gone, sir.
- Fine. We'll find him.
- Okay, Jerry. Let's go.
- Let the boy go, detective.
He's had enough for today.
You can discuss this
with him tomorrow.
Fine.
I will see you in the student store
tomorrow morning.
<i>[Brei]
It's a rip-off if you ask me.</i>
You kick Buddy Revell's ass,
and he gets away with 350 bucks.
Screw it. At this point
I don't really care.
That's a lie
and you know it.
<i>Excuse me.
You have any paper?</i>
Yeah. Sure.
Oh, I just need one sheet.
How much would that be?
A dollar a sheet? Great.
I'll take five.
<i>Jerry.</i>
<i>Vincent Costello told us
the student store was having
a little cash flow problem.</i>
I'll take two sheets.
Oh, and Jerry?
You did a great thing yesterday.
<i>Yeah, unbelievable.
I'll take three.</i>
Four sheets.
I'll take
a sheet.
<i>Hey, Jerry! I scored.</i>
You lasted four minutes.
I knew you were solid.
I'll take 30.
Gimme one.
Give me three.
Thank you.
I'll take two sheets.
<i>I'll take five.</i>
- This is incredible!
- There must be a hundred bucks!
<i>[Crowd Chattering]</i>
[Crowd Falls Silent]
Hi, Jerry.
Oh, uh, hi, Karen.
I guess I'll see you
at my house tonight.
Oh, yeah. Uh...
Hello, Jerry.
[Everyone Gasps]
Unbelievable!
Hmm. Looks like it's gonna be
one of those days.
That was the best fight since Craig Mattey
kicked Jeff Stevens' ass.
I still can't believe he dropped
Revell with just one punch.
Someone told me
he's a black belt.
Did you guys hear? He's goin' out with
Karen Clarke now.
The guy's a stud. Did you hear
what happened in his English class?
Isn't that where
he attacked Miss Farmer?
Yeah!
Jerry ripped her clothes off
in front of the whole class!
I heard she decked him
on the spot.
The guy's
a completely righteous dude.
Did you hear that Mr. O'Rourke
tried to keepJerry from fighting Buddy?
<i>Mitchell wouldn't do it.
Jerry wanted to fight Buddy?</i>
Yeah. Buddy was pickin' on him.
Jerry told him to meet him
in the parking lot at 3:00.
This guy's a madman!
That's nothin'. Did you hear
about the switchblade?
Buddy was going to try and knife
Jerry before the fight,
butJerry picked his locker
and got to the knife before him.
It's unbelievable.
Why haven't I heard of
this Mitchell guy before?
Who knows?
I guess he's not the kind
of guy to brag about himself.
I think he's kinda cute.
Did you hear what he did
to Miss Farmer?
I'm telling you, this guy's
supposed to be a total psycho.
