Shit! Shit!
Sorry, sorry! God! Sorry!
Oh, I mean... It's OK.
Your hair's good.
Thanks...
Hello.
Julia?
-Yes.
Who else would it be?
Oh... Sorry. That came out wrong.
Oh, I'm so nervous. Say something!
You're not like your photo.
Really? Oh, sorry.
I'm Sam...
-Yes.
to complete the introductions.
-Sam, yes. Hi.
Do you want a drink?
Martini.
Sure.
Two martinis, please.
The truth is I'm just... I'm
taking a break from my life
and, uh... so my...
my father is dying, basically.
I'm sorry to hear that.
-Oh, no, no.
I don't want your sympathy. Um...
But my mother's already gone, and I
don't have any brothers or sisters,
so it's just me and...
I just wanted to put on a nice dress
and be a woman meeting
a man out in the world
and, you know, just feel
alive and, like, alive.
I...
But the thing is, I'm nursing my
dying father, as I said, and, um...
I want sex.
Yeah, I really want sex.
Uh!
-Uh!
Yeah!
-Uh! Uh!
Oh!
Sorry.
I'll let the agency
know you stayed longer.
Not a problem. Goodnight.
Ooh.
Dad?
Mmm...
Time? Is it?
It's time for this. Here.
There you go.
-Oh...
Whoop.
Let me have the television.
You're bright-eyed this morning.
Where's the remote?
-Uh... somewhere.
Has the paper come yet?
I'll bring it up.
Which channel?
Oh, no here. Give it. Give it, give it.
Whoa...
The veteran star died peacefully
in her sleep aged 98.
Oh, another one fallen off the perch.
Recapping our top stories this morning,
and severe flooding in northern
New South Wales continues,
with the Prime Minister
declaring a state of emergency.
And shocking news from Melbourne,
where a pioneer of IVF
has delivered a revelation
that will send shock waves
through the community.
Julius Bechly, the Nobel Prize
winning reproductive scientist,
has published an open letter
announcing that over his 30-year career,
he supplemented his own sperm
in place of that many infertile fathers.
The deception may have resulted in
the births of more 100 children.

Cut! Cut, cut!
So it's "please, please,
please", then "autumn leaves".
Are you serious?
Does that... does that really matter?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Just, um...
Can I just take one second?
Can I have my bag?
OK, let's reset.
OK, kids. Hand actions, hand actions.
Great!

So can we get the kids out, please?
Clear some space. Thank you!
Some water?
-Yeah. Roxy...
Can we grab a bottle of
water, please, over here?
Honestly, I can't guarantee
no-one is going to talk
if this keeps happening.
It won't.
Oh, my God, these pills are a
hundred times more powerful
than a regular painkiller.
I mean, where did she even...
-Diane. Diane.
Hello, love.
What's going on?
It's alright. The shoot's over, love.
It's over.
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.
Um... they're just... they're those...
They're just if...
I was told to take one if my
shoes get really uncomfortable,
so I had to take one.
I sincerely hope no-one
on the production...
Has someone told you to take these?
Don't worry about that now!
Look, just... have... have a sip, love.
Focus on feeling better.
And... nobody's angry.
Nobody's angry.
Nobody's angry.
Honestly, it was one pill! I swear
I don't need to go to rehab.
It's not rehab. It's a refocus centre.
Just a few days, love.
That's all we ask.
I don't even know if it was that pill!
I didn't have breakfast this morning
and I think I've got an ear infection!
Look, Roxy, I know that you
probably can't see it now,
but this is what we call
a defence mechanism.
That doesn't even make sense!
No, you don't... you don't understand.
I do not have a drug problem.
The only problem is when we
shoot five eps in one day.
It's not a problem. It's a journey.
Listen to me. Listen! Mum!
-It's a journey. It's a long journey.
And your father and I want you to know
that we are partners with
you on this journey.
Aren't we, Ron?
-We are.
Now get in the car.
We're doing this because we love you.
Oh, for fuck's sake, Ron!
Get a wriggle on.
Friggin' paparazzi will
be here any second.
When you...
I'm... I'm sorry. I... I...
Just tell me what you like
and what you don't like.
When we have sex...
you're...
all on top of me.
And you're up in my face and...
it's all just... hair
and grunting and...
I don't... like the intimacy.
I think intimacy's my problem.
No, no. What were you gonna say?
Don't flick my nipples.
I don't like it.
Don't flick your nipples?
-No, don't.
It's always just...
too hard or too soft. Just...
leave 'em alone.
And when you pat my stomach...
Just don't pat my stomach.
OK. I...
I promise I won't pat
your stomach again.
And when you...
go down there, Tim...
Well, you've never liked that.
Well, when you do it, it's just wrong.
OK, that's not helpful, Edie.
You need to be more specific.
Right.
Well...
Uh...
It's the pressure,
Tim, with your tongue.
It's just...
Yes?
What is it about the
pressure with my tongue?
Step it through for him.
It's... way too heavy.
It's like you're starving.
Well, I've gone online for pointers,
I've spoken to other people...
You've spoken to people?
Yeah.
-Are you serious?
Who have... who have you
spoken to about this?
Well, it doesn't matter
who I've spoken to.
It does!
-Are you sure
that it's my technique?
No. I mean...
Yeah. No. It's... it's... probably me.
Actually, it is. It's me.
It's... it's my fault.
Edie, that's a cop-out.
I will try harder.
Don't you think for our
marriage to survive,
your body just needs to love my body?
I know that's not everything
that marriage is,
but... it seems to me
like that is the one thing that
you can't cure with therapy.
Well, that's depressing.
I feel really bad for the
things I said in there.
Don't feel bad about being honest.
Oh, God.
Is this the right thing we're doing?
I hope so.
Ooh... see, I like it when you do that.
Which way are you going?
That way.
-That's the long way.
Is it?
He's waiting.
-Thanks, Amanda.
That's the password for the wifi.
Don't we already have a password?
Yeah, but that wifi didn't work.
This is for the new wifi.
The working wifi.
-Hopefully!
Great. Thank you.
Is everyone here?
-Yep. Ready to go.
OK.
Oh, file, file, file...
-There.
Hi, Tim.
-You're a bit behind time, Edie.
We've got the Ky Emerson
litigants to brief.
Yes. I'm ready.
-OK.
So we just need to prep
them for the months ahead,
because once we file...
They need to know what they're in for.
-Yep.
So I'm gonna reassure
them that we're a team
and we're gonna be in for the long haul.
And I'll fire them up.
-Yes, please.
There's this too. I
thought you should see.
Bechly Institute.
Julius?
What? Using his own sperm?
No way.
-Poor Julia.
Show them in.
Bechly Institute. Please hold the line.
Bechly Institute, please hold.
I've run out of phone lines.
I'm only catching about a fifth
of the calls that are coming in,
and all I'm saying is, "Please hold."
OK. We're gonna have to record a message
telling people that if
they are former clients
and they have concerns,
to leave their details and
we'll get back to them.
Is a statement coming?
Working on it.
Anyone coming in today... reschedule.
I've done that. Mr and Mrs Hobbs
are here already, though.
They got in early. Should I...?
-No. I can see them.
Isaac...
did you know about this?
No.
Bechly Institute, please hold.
Hello.
-What's going on?
Oh... um... I don't know.
He didn't tell you that
he'd written to the paper?
Julia?
-Um...
Oh, I posted a letter a few days
ago addressed to the editor,
but he writes to them
all the time, so...
usually to take issue
with grammar and...
But he didn't tell you what was in
the letter? He didn't hint, even?
No. I...
He must have a reason.
Yeah, there must be an explanation.
There must...
Maybe it's, um... his medication.
OK. I'm gonna come over.
Don't worry. I'll be right there.
Hang on.
Julius...
quite the prank you've played on us.
Unless it's not true.
Dad, has there been a mistake?
The clinic has to release a statement.
And, uh... Julia...
well...
-I'm fine.
I don't think that's true.
Whatever Dad's done, there's reasons.
There's mitigating circumstances.
I'm not worried, Dad.
The paper said that over the course
of your career, maybe 30 years...
you used your own sperm.
Mmm.
Did you, uh... keep records of which
samples you've tampered with?
No. Uh...
You must have some idea. Some of them...
You must remember.
Uh, well, there's no formal, uh... list.
I'm gonna go make some tea.
Hi.
-Uh...
Where are you?
-Oh, I, um...
I just realised we were out of milk,
so... yeah, I just
ducked out to get some.
I'll be back in a minute.
-OK.
Bye.
Could've been anything, you know.
Setting fires.
Cutting yourself.
Anything.
It's just... whatever gets rid of
that noise in your head, you know?
Yeah.
-And for me...
it was flashing.
Just the right tit, never the left.
Oh.
...pioneer of IVF has delivered
a shocking revelation.
Julius Bechly, the Nobel Prize
winning reproductive scientist,
has published an open letter
announcing that over his 30-year career,
he supplemented his own sperm
in place of that of
many infertile fathers.
The deception may have resulted in
the births of over 100 children.
Mr Hulme! Mr Hulme!
How have you reacted to
Mr Bechly's actions?
Have you spoken to Julius Bechly?
The actions of Julius Bechly have
brought shame to this institute
and to the whole field
of reproductive science.
We do not endorse his actions,
and we will be launching
a thorough investigation
into every one of his cases.
It will take time, and I apologise.
You're a close friend of Julius Bechly.
He has been my mentor and friend
since I came to work at
the Bechly Institute
as a young postgraduate.
I condemn his actions
in the strongest terms.
What Julius has done is
a despicable deception
perpetrated against innocent
people over decades.
He has negated a lifetime's work.
Are you disappointed?
I will never forgive him.
Ah!
Were you or any of the staff
aware of this indiscretion?
Mr Hulme! Mr Hulme! Mr Hulme!
But that definitely was the
clinic you went to, wasn't it?
I really think you're barking
up the wrong tree here, love.
I remember when I was little,
that doctor was in the
paper, he'd won a prize.
And Mum said, "He was the doctor
that helped us have you."
I remember his funny cheeks.
You, young lady, are just
looking for a distraction.
That is all this is.
It's not a distraction.
It's my whole identity.
He... he would've helped
hundreds of couples. Thousands!
So, you admit, it was him?
The important thing right now is for
you to focus on your treatment.
I knew it!
For God's sake, you've only
been there for five minutes!
Yeah, well, all the counsellors here say
that the most important thing
is to get to the root cause.
What... what if this is...
is my root cause?
Of what?!
-Of everything.
Why... why nothing feels right.
Why...
Why I can't get through the day.
Why...
Why Dad and I look nothing alike.
Wha...?!
I think we look alike!
You need to come and pick me up.
You need to give the
treatment time to work.
You cannot leave me here when
all of this is happening.
This is not a healthy conversation.
I'm hanging up.
-No!
I love you.
Fuck.
Hi.
-Hey.
So, you've seen the news?
Yes. Yes.
That flooding in New South
Wales, that's terrible.
No, Mum.
Can you engage with this, please?
What do you know?
Do you like yourself?
What?
-I just...
I just want to establish that first.
Because, if you do, then...
Mum, you told me that I was conceived
using sperm from an anonymous donor.
I see you're not gonna have a
sense of humour about this one.
Humour, Mother?
Yes, Mother, because you
didn't have a father.
You know? I'm your one and only
parent, just little old me.
And you are... you beautifully
are because of that.
OK, you are being really
combative right now.
I'm not. I'm not.
-You are.
I just want to remind
you that, you know,
we were a really good team.
We didn't have anyone else,
but we didn't NEED anyone else.
-You're giving me statements of
personal policy now.
-I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.
I'm just... Just...
You didn't miss out on anything.
-Can you just stop?
And take this seriously, alright?
Because, if Julius is my father, then...
it really matters to me.
-OK. OK. He's your father.
There you go, the secret's out.
I mean, has your life changed?
Ugh...
Wow.
You told me it was an anonymous donor.
Look, Julius Bechly, he
helped a lot of women...
I mean, he helped me.
You made this...
decision... for me, about...
-Oh...
Parents make a lot of decisions
for their kids, honey.
Yeah, yeah, they do, they do.
But this one...
was about who I am...
as a person in the world.
Because you knew who my father was
and it's... it's someone
I've known my entire life.
Were you ever gonna tell me?
No. Because, well, he's a narcissist.
I mean, you know, that's what he is.
-Oh, for God's sake.
So, look, he is not a
father, he is a donor.
And you didn't miss out on anything.
-He is a father. He's my father.
He's not your father.
Don't look for a father in him.
I... I really don't think
he's capable of that.
Mr Hulme!
Has Julius Bechly confided
in you which of the...
I've made a statement already.
In which you said
Bechly was your mentor.
Can you get off the property, please?
I... Are you Miss Julia Bechly?
Yes.
-Go inside, Julia.
How have you reacted to your
father's revelations, Miss Bechly?
Um... fine.
What, you're fine with this deception?
What?
-Don't talk to them.
Did you aid and abet his activities?
Are the two of you...
-Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.
Uh, aid and abet? For real?
-Yeah. Don't talk to them.
Sorry.
Is he awake?
-Um, yeah.
You did well.
The personal angle was
exactly the thing.
And when you said you
would never forgive me,
that was perfect.
Now, I think you've done a wonderful job
protecting the institute,
but we should be estranged, you
shouldn't come here anymore.
I'm not going to.
Mm... mm... Yes, good.
Not good.
Nothing that you have done is good.
Mm?
-I meant everything that I said.
No.
-You've destroyed us.
All of our work. It's gone.
Wait a minute...
-There's a thing called trust.
There's a thing called consent.
There's a thing...
Yeah... You know how
our whole field began,
women etherised, impregnated,
but there was no...
There was no consent!
I know. I've heard it a thousand times.
There was no designer element to it.
You just said thank you and
went home with your baby.
That doesn't make it right.
Well, it makes a baby,
though, that's for sure.
Hm?
You did the wrong thing and you knew it.
And if you didn't, you should have.
Shame on you!
This is me. I know that that's me.
Like...
-Wow.
Yeah, it was very...
-That's extraordinary.
It was very, like... a deep...
You know, when you just... A knowing.
Yes. Yeah. A knowing.
-A knowing.
What is this?
Uh, she's a children's entertainer.
Roxy Karibas.
Farmyard Frank.
Yes, I do...
She thinks she's Dad's child.
my life, it's because...
I never knew my father.
What chance did I have?
My childhood was...
was stolen from me.
I just... I just want to know my father.
That... that's all I want.
To know him.
And to meet any siblings I might have.
That's it.
That's how I can turn this
into something positive.
What if I welcome it?
I mean, these people are my siblings...
What do you mean by 'welcome it'?
They're Dad's children.
If I want to be good to
them, then shouldn't I...
What, invite everyone to lunch?
Exactly.
-I'm joking.
Dad has made me the central
hub of this huge wheel.
I can help everyone.
That's the meaning of it.
What are you doing?
Julia?
Julia.
Hi.
I'm Julia Bechly, Julius's daughter,
and, um... uh, I guess
a lot of people are...
surprised and confused
and, um, possibly angry
about what's happened.
But the one thing that we've all
found out is that we're connected.
You know, for 30 years this
invisible family has existed
and we've only just found
out about each other.
So I'm going to invite
everyone together.
Your siblings?
-Yes. Yeah.
Um, like a gathering.
Um, oh, like a family reunion,
but for the first time.
And... uh, we'll collect DNA samples.
And, um...
I'm going to host it.
Thank you.
-Thank you.
Oh, Julia. Julia, arrivals.
Oh. Sorry. Hm?
Hi. I'm Colin. Hello.
-Hello.
Oh! No.
-Hello, Julia.
Hi. Sorry. You can't...
-You can't come in.
Just... It's...
-Sorry.
No, no, no. Thank you very much.
I didn't even know I was an IVF
kid and then it was on the news,
my parents told me, and
I'm like, "Holy shit!"
Yes.
-Like, I grew up in WA.
So, I guess, everyone's coming
from, like, everywhere.
DNA tests...
Hello. I'm Julia. Hi.
Awesome. Well, help yourself...
Julia. Hello. OK.
I'll tag you. I'll tag you.
Hello. Nice to meet you.
Vegetarian sausages there. Hello.
Come in, guys.
-Hello.
Drink, mingle.
-Hello.
How's it going?
-Um, I'm good.
Good. Good. Excellent.
-Yeah.
It's... Brothers. Brothers.
Lots of brothers.
Hello. Hello.
-Hi!
G'day. How are you going?
-Hello.
Oh. Cool.
-Yeah.
This could be a sister.
Oh, God.
-What?
Oh, God.
-Uh, you know them?
Oh, yeah. And I don't want either
of them to be my siblings...
Julia.
-Oh...
Hello. They've seen you.
Hi, guys!
Hey.
-Hey. Tim.
Hi.
-Hi.
Ohh.
What are you doing here?
Mum had me after treatment
at the Bechly Institute.
Sorry. Um...
You're... you're...
might be one of...
-Surprise!
Oh!
No. Sorry...
-Yeah, I know.
Drinks?
-Yes.
So, um...
The "anonymous donor" turned
out not to be anonymous.
But we had sleepovers.
Uh, yeah. And...
your dad called me 'Sparky'.
How are you feeling, Julia?
I don't know.
Ah... Oh.
You should have one of these.
Um, there's one for everyone.
So, this can be yours.
-Oh.
Uh, it's a show bag.
-Oh, a family welcome bag.
That's what I was gonna say, but...
Yeah.
Yeah, and there's, um...
there's DNA testing information in
there, so we can find out for sure.
Does it feel really warm in here?
Mm, nope. Not overly warm.
-No. Temperature feels fine to me.
Oh, OK.
Mm.
-Julia!
Hmm!
Doctor, what's your role here today?
I'm hoping today can start a new...
-No, sorry, you can't just film this.
No, no, I do not give you
permission to film me.
I do not give you permission.
Sorry, no, they, um...
they came in with me.
Uh, no. They can't be here.
-Uh, just...
What you are doing is so beautiful,
and you should let them film it.
Julia, come with me. Come with me.
Well, maybe just... just hold back.
Hold back.
Maybe just hang back
a bit, but don't go.
I will not participate in anything
that they are filming, alright?
Are you... are you OK?
Oh. Yeah. Sorry. My mouth
is just really dry.
Hello. I'm Oscar.
Hi. I'm Roxy.
Do you want some... more?
-Oh. No, I'm good. Um...
Sorry. Excuse me.
Hi... hello.
-Hi. Um, I'm Sam.
Yeah, I remember.
You two know each other?
This is Natalie, my wife.
Oh. Um, hi.
I... I'm Julia Bechly.
Hi.
So, do you two know each other, or...?
Nope.
Oh. Uh, no. Uh... Sorry.
It's my mistake.
There's so many people
here, and, um, yeah,
I think there's a Sam that
I was talking to earlier.
Thank you for hosting this.
You! Oh! Are you a Bechly baby?
No. Uh, that's...
My parents had IVF at
your father's clinic.
Wow.
Welcome.
Excuse me for a minute.
Excuse me everybody! Hello!
Whoo!
I'm Roxy Karibas and I am
so excited to meet you all.
Hands up, all the brothers!
And hands up, all the sisters!
Whoo!
Whoo. Whoo...
Wha...?
Three of us!
Well, isn't that something.
I prepared a song...
-Whoo!
for the occasion.
♪ I feel it in my fingers ♪
♪ I feel it in my toes ♪
♪ Love is all around me ♪
♪ And so the feeling grows ♪
♪ It's written on the wind ♪

Killer. Killer!
It's amazing. Yeah. It was...
Oh, I'm really excited about Julia.
Who is she...
Hello?
Hi, everybody.
Hello. Hi.
I am Edie Flanagan and I
have known Julia for...
a very, very long time, actually.
And now it appears we may
have more in common.
I have set up a Facebook page,
because the most important thing is
for us to get to know each other,
to exchange contact information,
so that over the coming weeks and months
we can all support each other.
And I really strongly urge you
to use the DNA tests
that Julia's handed out,
because that way we can
get a real clear picture
of the scale of what has happened here.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hi!
Hello, everyone.
I'm Julia. Um...
I'm the one who grew up
with dad, and, uh...
I guess I'm the boring
one compared to those...
Julia. Julia.
Um... yeah.
And, um, I just...
You know, Dad is not well, and, um...
you know, in his words, he's
about to fall off the perch.
Yeah, and I don't like
that phrase either.
Um...
But... you know, I'm just...
Oh! I'm just so glad everyone's here.
Yeah. Except for one guy,
um, but you know who you are,
because I accidentally...
I slept with my brother!
Sorry. I sh... I shouldn't
have said that.
Uh...
Do you want a drink?
No, thanks.
-Sure?
So... how was that for you?
There are 40 or so people
who can potentially trace
their genes back to Julius.
Mm.
And there's more out
there, lots, lots more.
And?
And what?
-What was it like...
meeting your brothers and sisters?
Fine.
The class action you're planning,
do you want to tell me about that?
You noticed that?
-Yes, I noticed that.
I notice your ideas.
Mm.
So, you think I'm getting ideas?
What's this?
-I don't know.
Maybe I'm just in the mood.
No, I think you're
trying to distract me.
Oh.
Well, you need a bit of
distracting sometimes.
OK.
I am just gonna have a shower...
and wash off the day.
Right.
-I'll be one sec.
Yeah, sure, except
you'll be half an hour,
and you hope that I'll
fall asleep waiting.
And then you'll remember an
email that you have to send
and you'll disappear
and then I'll come and find
you asleep on the couch.
Tim...
-A class action, Edie? Really?
Someone will mount a class action!
Come on, you know they will.
This is a car crash!
That doesn't mean you have to be
the one chasing the ambulance.
I'm going to bed.
I have some emails to send.
Yeah, thought so.
Today, I am successful.
Tomorrow, I will be successful.
Every day, I am successful.
Shut up!
OK, so, today's experiment,
which is really fun,
is called Sink or Float?
And, uh, yeah, so, the main question is,
will this sink or will this float?
Now, I have all sorts of things,
I've got some wood, some
metal, some plastic, and...
What's so funny?
If I understand the joke, I'll
laugh along too, I promise.
Um... you...
Uh-huh?
Your brother.
What about my brother?
You sex feeling?
Yeah, except for one guy,
<i>Um, but you know who you are,</i>
because I accidentally...
I slept with my brother!
Fuck! Shit!
Roxy, can you tell me about
Julia having sex with her brother?
Oh, no, no, no, no. I
can't comment on that.
You'd have to ask Julia.
And that footage, it
was just one moment.
Is she an alcoholic?
She's a lovely, lovely person
and the day was beautiful.
It felt like pieces coming together,
pieces of a vast puzzle.
But the biggest piece is
still of course missing,
and that is my father Julius.
And until I meet him, well, this
is a puzzle with a hole in it.
Right in the middle.
10:30 and we're on the line with
Roxy Karibas at the heart of the...
Dad!
Mum! I was just...
This is not helping anyone.
It's not helping you and it is
certainly not helping your father.
It is not about either of you.
You know that.
-Of course it is!
We don't even know yet, Roxy.
We don't know anything. But you're
acting like it's a done deal.
And you seem so excited about
having another father.
No, Dad, I'm not excited, I just...
I really wanna know.
I want to know the truth.
Don't you?
I don't wanna know that
you're not my daughter.
I'm so sorry, Dad, but I can't
pretend it's not happening.
Well, you could be a little
bit more private about it.
You have never been private
about anything in our lives.
Well, this is different!
This whole business is horrible.
We lost our entire life savings to
that clinic. I was sick as a dog.
And to think now that we
might be being betrayed...
No matter what I find out...
you will always be my parents.
Always.
Well, as your parents, we are no
longer enabling this behaviour.
I am not going back to rehab.
Well, you won't be continuing with
this ridiculous quest either.
Not if you're under our roof.
Um... Dad, there's some footage
from the gathering and it's bad.
It's, um... it's mortifying.
I've seen it.
Oh, Daddy, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry that you...
Well, that's why I did the announcement,
to avoid interbreeding.
You're all reaching that age
now to have no modesty.
Sorry?
Well, it's a bit late to
have you all put down now.
You gave me that letter
to post to the paper
without even the littlest bit of
warning about what was in it.
You made me post that
letter and now you say,
"Oh, I did it to stop interbreeding."
Well, maybe the best day to
have done that would have been
the day before I slept with my
brother, not the day after, Dad.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad, can you understand what I'm saying?
You're going to be OK.
Isaac.
Did you just say Isaac?
-Could you wait here, please?
Me?
-Yes.
Um, that's what he said. I think
he wants you to forgive him.
That's not fair.
I already told Edie to come.
I don't know, it just seemed...
it just seemed fair.
And Roxy called, so I told her too.
I let him have it, that's what
triggered this whole episode.
And... I just... I should
have sucked it up,
because he's not gonna be
around much longer and...
I'll come.
Thank you.
Cool. OK.
Thank you. Thanks for doing that.
I've been really worried about you.
On the way here I was thinking
that we have to get free.
Free?
-Yeah.
We've been living under his
rules for a long time,
you and me, and it's enough.
We're our own people. We're
not his minions, right?
Right.
-The reality of you,
it's not what he says it is.
You have to live your own life.
Because you're a unique
and beautiful person.
Yes.
-You've gotta back yourself, OK?
Like, go for what you want.
Really go for it because you deserve it.
Yeah, I do deserve it. And so do you.
We both do. We have to, like...
I don't know, take chances and
see what's out there, and...
You deserve everything you hope for.
Yes! Julia, so do you.
No, no, no. No, no. Sorry.
-Oh!
No, no, I didn't mean that.
-Sorry. Don't worry.
Hi.
I don't know what I'm
supposed to call you.
Dad.
-You can call him Julius.
When I first walked in and saw you,
at first I didn't feel anything,
but...
but hearing you say
that one word, Dad...
it felt like... like history.
Do you mind?
-Uh... I kind of would mind.
Please?
-OK.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Dad, I was hoping that meeting
you would be just the beginning.
I imagined our long
conversations into the night.
I wanted to hear all your stories.
Hear about your work and all of
your favourite foods, and books.
Waltzing with you on my wedding day,
with you in a wheelchair
and me spinning you.
Are you sure he's conscious right now?
Yeah, I think, um, he's just tired.
Maybe I should sing his favourite song.
Do... do you know what it is?
Orchestra music.
I'll just hum.
Julius is your father.
Thank you. It's good to know for sure.
Mm.
What's... this?
The results of the DNA tests.
Julius is my father.
Ha.
OK.
-OK.
Yeah.
-So, the results?
Yeah, I can't tell you.
The results are between the clinic
and the potential siblings.
How will I know if people
coming forward are authentic?
I'll have to ask them for proof anyway,
so you may as well just tell me.
I'm sorry, Julia.
You know, Roxy's in there
and she just promised to waltz
with Dad at her wedding.
Her tests?
-I can't.
I guess I was secretly hoping
that she was mistaken.
What have you got against her?
-Are you serious?
Yeah. She's not so bad.
Men. It is a male thing.
Tim was exactly the same.
How can you not see what she is?
She's a bird with a broken wing.
Oh, no, she is not a
bird with a broken wing.
She is a bird who won't stop flapping,
eating everything in sight and flapping.
And takes up all the space in
the room with all the flapping.
Before going into a bigger room
and then flapping around more
and eating everything up again.
And then shitting on all
the other nicer birds.
Mm.
-You guys are the nicer birds?
He wants me to come and stay.
I told him how my parents
have rejected me.
Rejected you?
Disowned.
It's... painful.
But, anyway, Genetic Dad has
said I should come and stay.
Is he, though, your genetic dad?
Is he?
Sister! You're my sister.
Oh!
-Wow.
Oh!
I'll just grab some clean PJs for Dad.
Oh, my God, we can totally help.
This is your dad's house?
Oh, you can't stay here.
-Where are we staying, then?
Oh, you can stay with me.
-Oh.
Why can't you stay at a friend's place?
I don't really have any friends.
Right. But you're not broke.
Yep.
Farmyard Frank? You must
have been earning money?
Well, as a hired performer.
I don't own any of it.
And it's easy to spend the pay cheque.
I'm not about money.
Cool.
OK.
Are we OK?
Do you mean am I OK with finding
out that you're my sister?
Yes. Let's start with that.
OK. Um... let's start with that.
Well, with our history, all these
years that we were friends,
and now it turns out that...
Friends. Yeah, I guess... I guess we
were, like, a version of friends.
I'm trying to find out how you feel.
OK, how I feel? Um, hmm.
Well, you kind of stole my boyfriend.
Right. Right, yes. OK, this is
exactly what I'm talking about.
You think that I stole your boyfriend.
It's more of an objective fact.
There are no objective
facts, first of all.
That's an extraordinary
admission from a lawyer.
I didn't steal anything from anyone.
Tim did not belong to you,
and do we really have to go into a
long list of who did what to who?
You brought it up.
Yeah, but I don't wanna fight for
control of some idea of the past.
I knew you'd do this.
Do what?
-You'd bully me into...
Bully you. I'm not... How
am I bullying you, Julia?!
You ask these very loaded,
very leading questions,
but before I can say anything,
you're cutting me off and then...
I just think if we're facing this,
is it not better that
we face it together?
That's what I want.
Isn't that what you want?
You could help me with
this, if you want.
Julia?!
OK.
Is this your dad's work room?
Uh, yeah. It's his study.
These.
Oh. Yeah, parents would
send them to say thank you.
And these are the pictures he
decided to put on the wall?
Look, that's me.
Ha.
Oh, my God.
He said there was no formal list.
Like, no formal one.
These are them, aren't they?
Dad's children.
Who was the first?
I assume Julia.
Oh, I'm not sure.
There were people at the gathering
that seemed older, I think.
I'm 30.
I'm 30.
-Oh, me too. Gemini.
Gemini.
-Gemini.
Hi.
Suppose you're after
some explanations too.
You and my mum were friends.
Yes, yes.
And you conceived Edie
at my father's clinic.
Yeah, that's right, yeah.
And you knew.
You knew it was with my father's...
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Your father.
He helped me, that's right.
How much did my mother know?
OK. I'm...
I'm gonna tell you what
actually happened, alright?
Because you've been told your whole
life that your mum and dad met,
they fell in love, had a baby.
-Yeah.
Yeah. Well, that's not
exactly what happened.
Um...
Well, Vita and I, we went together
to the clinic to get treatment
and your mum met your dad at the
clinic when she was conceiving you.
What?
Well, it's pretty romantic.
I mean, I really don't know
why she felt this need to...
weave a story of a...
I think that she got scared and she
just wanted you to feel normal.
Oh.
-Oh, honey, honey. I know.
I know.
You are upset, of course,
but you have been told
bullshit your whole life.
And I just think that Vita never
imagined that you would find out
and I promised, I swore that
I wouldn't tell you, and...
It's just, Julius, he just...
He ruined it! Didn't he?
Oh, Julia, honey.
Julia...
God.
Fuck!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mum.
Sorry.
How is he?
He's probably ready to go home soon.
This is the end.
Oh, no, no. No, it's not the end.
He needs looking after.
Um... Sorry, I don't...
He's been refusing interventions and
when he came in he was dehydrated,
but now he's rallying.
He's eating, eating
well, bowel movements.
Are you sure this isn't some
last-minute thing, you know,
when someone seems to
improve and then...
No, I think he's on the rebound.
I'll leave you to it.
Amanda, I want to run a
square-off with you.
You'll be devil's advocate.
You've got prep materials? No
prep, just you and your brain.
When?
-Now.
No, you don't need them.
Just... Come on.
The guy uses his sperm
instead of other men's,
inserting himself into the lives
of the people that are paying him,
and then he keeps pictures
of the children on his wall.
Like trophies.
OK. What are the damages
you want to sue for?
Malpractice, wrongful
life, wrongful birth.
Being alive isn't an injury
that you can sue for.
Yes, that is a good point.
Also, wrongful life cases
have lousy precedents.
OK, wrongful conception, then.
It's genetic rape.
Eat. You're not eating.
In this case, if Julius Bechly
hadn't done what he did...
Spoofed all over everyone.
These people, your siblings,
they wouldn't exist at all.
Yes, but they do exist, and
therefore they have rights.
Do you agree that Julius
did the wrong thing?
And by that, I mean that he acted
in a manner at odds with ethics.
At odds with the law.
Yes.
-Alright.
So this case will address that
wrongdoing, do you think?
I'm asking what you think.
I think anger is exhilarating.
Hate is exciting.
But they aren't the only options.
So...
This a landmark case
and it's right here.
It's career making.
It doesn't happen every day.
-Uh-huh. Yep.
So...
OK.
-OK.
So, is this a thing now?
Every time you want to see me you
just send me a two-word email?
"My office."
Every time I do that, you come.
So yeah.
So, why haven't we gone
after Julius Bechly yet?
Every five minutes I'm
checking the email thinking,
"Are we doing this yet?
Are we having a meeting?"
Why not?
-A lot of reasons.
I'm not convinced it's for us.
It's a medical class
action, it's high profile
and we're connected to
someone involved in it.
As your partner in this...
-I'm not convinced.
What would it take to convince you?
I'm worried that Edie hasn't
processed the full impact of it yet.
So...
Let's just hold off, OK?
I take it back.
I don't think the therapy is helping.
I think you're going backwards.
Get fucked.
-It's gonna happen anyway, Tim.
Someone will take on Bechly.
If it's us, at least Edie'll have
a measure of control over it.
She'd probably prefer that.
Shall we call her in here?
-No, we shouldn't.
And don't start having private
conversations with her about it.
She wants to do it, doesn't she?
Saying it for the third time now.
I'm not convinced.
Fine.
Thank you.
Tell me honestly,
do you ever imagine yourself
fucking your therapist?
It must happen, right?
Has my name ever come up?
In therapy? Even once?
You're all we talk about.
Ah.
How are you?
Cool. I have something
to look forward to.
That Roxy is something.
I like her.
I saw that.
Dad. Um...
You and Mum got married later.
After she was already pregnant with me.
Uh, so my question is, um...
did you do it to boost
success rates of the clinic?
Or are you just a psychopath
with a God complex?
You never stopped to think about
what these lies would do to people?
Or what your confession would do?
Huh.
No, because you didn't plan on
being around for the consequences.
Well, you're going to be, Dad.
Because you've played
with people's lives.
Oh! Do you know what
everyone's problem is?
What?
-You're all so entitled.
So precious.
You're not even sorry!
Well, you're alive.
Your genes are good.
Get on with it.
You see me as your carer.
As your servant.
OK.
Being your daughter has defined me.
That's me, the daughter
of the Nobel laureate,
but I don't even have
that to myself anymore.
I'm glad that you're home
and I'm glad that you're looking forward
to getting to know your children, but...
I'm not gonna look after
you anymore, Dad.
Wh...
I'm finished.
You should know I've decided
that I am going to pursue
the class action against Julius.
Once you begin an action
against Julius Bechly,
there is no turning back.
I don't want to turn back.
Julia is your friend.
This isn't about Julia, OK?
I'm not trying to hurt Julia.
See, I don't know what's
more frightening,
the fact that you're
telling yourself that
or that you actually believe it.
Tim, you know, I do really
love it when you patronise me
but right now I'm actually
just not in the mood,
so can we just not go there, please?
-You know, Julia has let you in.
She has invited you in.
Her motives are pure.
-Pure.
Really? Pure?
What kind of a word is pure?
When has a human being
ever had pure motives?
And whose side are you on, Tim?
-Yours.
Really?
-I'm on your side.
Everything you do here you're
gonna have to live with forever.
I'm trying to make you see that!
What I see is my husband defending
everyone apart from me.
Because you're making a mistake.
Are you still in love with Julia?
What?
-The question was plain.
The question was cheap.
Oh, right, so I'm cheap now as well?
Do you have any more terms of abuse
you want to maybe chuck at me?
You're a shitty friend.
You're a shitty sister.
And you're turning into
someone I don't recognise.
Keep up.
Roxy!
Are you here?
Hello?
Don't come in!
Uh, I'm going to order food.
Pizza, probably.
Oh, OK.
Hey!
Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?
You're in my house
sleeping with my sister
after you know how I've been...
The hospital? I thought that was just...
You're like family.
-I don't need any more family!
Julia!
-Julia!
What's going on?
-Julia.
Julia.
-It's fine.
I am so sorry. I don't do this.
I totally don't.
-It's fine. You're free people.
Who are you calling?
-Pizza.
Should I go?
-No.
Great.
Somebody else is here. Excellent!
Hi.
Tim and I had a fight
and it was about you.
Because you're a good person
and I'm a bad person.
Maybe I am.
I am.
What are you doing?
Just making up somewhere
for you to sleep.
Julia, before you offer
me somewhere to stay...
there will be a class
action against Julius.
You?
-Yes.
And I... think it's only
fair that I tell you.
What is wrong with all of you?
We're a family.
I... We're related!
This is our once in a lifetime
chance to be a family.
-I know. I know. I get it.
It's a lot to take in, but
Julia, he broke the law.
I am not attacking you.
It kind of feels like you are.
And you're still making up the bed.
Well, it's the right thing to do.
Tim was right.
You always put yourself last.
No, you're following me.
I want to be alone.
Do not film this.
Oh, I...
You and us and... just this...
Put words around it.
I learnt that in rehab.
There's a difference between
being related and being family.
Family takes time and care and effort.
And... meals shared and dishes
washed and beds made and...
shared history.
And intimacy.
Not lies and lawsuits and this
fundamentally messed up shit.
Sorry.
This whole thing has
landed on you and...
I'm so sorry.
I'll order pizza.
I've got money.
I didn't know you felt...
I don't.
I do, but...
Don't worry about it.
