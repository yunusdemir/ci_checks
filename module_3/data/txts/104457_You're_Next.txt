Oh, yeah, baby.
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Huh...
Looks like Erik Harson's home.
Yeah.
I heard he left his wife...
...for some college student.
He might be living here
full time now.
Oh, that's a shame.
We're so isolated up here...
...it might be nice
to have a neighbor.
I guess.
- I got this.
- Okay.
That's funny.
What?
It's open.
Doesn't look like
anyone's been in here.
Oh, you know, I bet the workmen...
...left the door open
last time they were here.
I'll get the groceries
out of the car...
...and check on the furnace.
So your parents
are pretty loaded, right?
Yeah, I guess.
My dad retired
from KPG last year...
...and he got an insane
severance package.
Wait, KPG?
As in, the defense contractor?
Yeah. He was just
in marketing, though.
Why?
Is that a problem
for you, babe?
Having dinner with fascists?
No. No. I want
to meet your family.
I hope this means
there's gonna be...
...some good booze
at your place, though.
Probably not.
My mom's on medication.
Can we stop somewhere
and get some, then?
Yes, we should. Good call.
Yes.
Hey, I lit the furnace.
Sorry. You okay?
Were you just upstairs?
No, I was in the basement.
Did you hear that, just now?
Hear what?
I heard footsteps.
I think someone's in the house.
Are you sure?
Paul, we gotta get out of here!
- Aubrey.
- Hurry up!
No. You go outside.
I'm gonna check the upstairs.
You're going outside with me!
It's just a creaky old house.
Paul! There is
someone up there!
I'll take this with me.
Okay? Are you happy?
No!
All right. You wait outside.
I'll be out in a minute.
- Careful!
- I will.
Hello?
Oh!
- Crispian!
- Dad.
You scared the shit out of me!
Yeah.
Oh, God.
Not to get off
on the wrong foot here...
...but, um, why is Mom
in the driveway crying?
Oh, God.
Come with me.
Hey.
You okay?
Crispian and I
looked in every room...
...on the second floor.
There's nobody there.
Oh, God.
I'm so silly.
Honey, I'm sorry.
No. No.
- You're embarrassed.
- No, I'm not.
- You must be Erin.
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Glad you could make it.
Yeah, thanks for having me.
Hey, you.
Come here.
It's okay.
Oh, we brought whiskey.
Well, come on in.
We'll be there in a minute.
What's going on?
I... I... Don't ask.
I don't know.
So your dad bought
this place to fix up?
Yeah. Supposed to be
his retirement project...
...something for him to work on,
but I'm pretty sure so far...
...he's just paid other people
to work on it.
Hey!
You're gonna break this bed.
It's like a hundred years old.
Sorry.
Your folks seem cool.
I mean, for people with money.
You're lucky.
I guess.
No, you are. You don't know
what most people
would give
to have folks like yours.
Whatever that means.
Come here.
So your brothers and sister
get in tomorrow?
Yeah. Tomorrow is my parents'
actual anniversary.
Thirty-five years,
can you imagine?
No. I can't, really.
Well, I look forward to meeting
the rest of your family tomorrow.
They're something.
It's been a long time
since we've all been together...
...so it should be interesting.
How so?
You'll see.
- Not in person?
- It's crazy.
Not in person.
...like old
black and white videos.
You've seen them. Okay,
well, you've seen the videos.
I've seen them in person.
But when they stand up...
...they're taller than you,
and if they've got baby...
I feel like
kangaroos fight guys...
...named, like, Gentleman Jack.
It's serious.
- Like, twisty, curly.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Hey, buddy.
You ever see kangaroos fight?
Stop!
Okay, okay.
- Kelly?
- ...up on their tails?
- Okay.
- Ow!
Don't hit me.
- Stop it.
- Come on.
- Pussy.
- No.
You almost hit my face.
Crispian...
Don't kiss him. Don't kiss
my wife. It's rude. Ugh!
- Thank you.
- Gross!
- That is sick.
- Come here and kiss me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's your brother. Yeah.
I'm not allowed
to kiss your brother.
Reminds me of when you were a kid.
You should've seen him.
- No, you shouldn't have.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
He was like a little...
...like a little sleepy,
chubby angel.
- Really?
- A little cherub.
- Yeah.
- I was always a little chubby.
He says only a little chubby.
I have a round face.
- Yeah.
- That doesn't mean I'm fat.
That's right.
It doesn't mean he's fat.
No, it means you're beautiful.
All the fat on him
means he's fat.
Okay.
Don't go just by his face.
I'm not fat.
Hey.
Oh, hello.
Um, I was just wondering
if you need...
...any help in here with anything?
I think I'm all set.
Okay.
Actually... Erin?
Yeah?
I am out of milk.
Oh, okay.
Could you go over
to the neighbor's house...
...and see if he has some?
His name's Erik.
Okay.
Well, I'll be right back.
How's this look, Drake?
Beautiful. Great color.
Grain looks nice, doesn't it?
Yeah.
I don't know about this grain.
- What's going on over here?
- Work.
- Hey, babe.
- Boys.
You look so adorable.
Can you hold that?
Ready?
- Beautiful.
- Come join us, Erin.
Actually, your mom
just asked me...
...to go to your neighbor's...
...to see if I could
borrow some milk.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Sounds like your mom.
- That's right.
Don't start.
Don't start with me.
I'm gonna go check on Kelly.
Looks so good, Dad.
Thanks, Drake.
So how'd that
fellowship thing turn out?
Oh! Uh...
Not so good.
No?
No. Uh...
I guess there were a lot of
applicants this year, and...
I haven't exactly been
published recently, so...
Well, there are some people
that aren't published...
...that do get
the fellowship, you know.
Shut the door.
Where'd your brother
find that girl?
I don't know.
Student? Former student?
Huh.
Current student.
I'll bet
she's kind of annoying.
Accent's just, like,
so jarring to me.
Babe, don't.
Okay. I don't... I'm not
feeling this right now, okay?
Don't give me that look.
Do you have any Vicodin?
Yeah. It's in my purse.
Hello? Is anyone home?
Aimee!
Hi, Mommy!
Oh, honey.
Look at you!
You are so beautiful.
Thank you.
I lost a little weight.
You look great.
- Thank you.
- You must be Tariq.
- Yes. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- My little Felix.
- Hi, Mom.
I'd like you to meet Zee,
my girlfriend.
Zee?
With two "E's." Z-E-E.
Wow. That's unique.
Nice to meet you, Zee.
Come on inside, everyone.
Come in.
Where's Crispian?
Did he bring
his new girlfriend?
- This is my boyfriend.
- Hi.
- Crispian.
- How you doing.
- Oh, you must be Erin.
- Yes.
Oh, my gosh.
You're so beautiful!
Thank you!
Hey. Good to see you.
- You're Erin?
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you.
Oh. And, Zee, right?
Erin, I know.
Hey, where's my princess?
Daddy!
This is my boyfriend, Tariq.
- Hey. How are you?
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
Who'd like a glass of wine?
- I would.
- I'll take some wine.
Okay. Let me
take care of that right now.
- Felix.
- Dad.
I just want you all to know
...how much it means to us
that you're all here. So...
Thank you for coming.
Aw, she's so cute.
I'm in love.
Let's bow our heads.
Dear Heavenly Father...
we thank Thee for Thy food.
Feed our souls
on the bread of life...
...and help us to do our part,
with kind words...
...and loving deeds. Amen.
Amen.
And thanks to Mom and Dad.
For having us
all here together.
It's our pleasure.
Um... So, Tariq,
what do you do?
Uh...
I'm a filmmaker.
- Is that right?
- Oh, wow!
Yeah. He's really good.
I don't think I know any
filmmakers. That is so...
- There's not a lot of us out there.
- ...interesting.
- Well, I've only made...
- Have you been on TV?
Not on TV. I've only made
one documentary...
...it was at the Cleveland
Underground Film Festival, 2008.
What is an
Underground Film Festival?
Do they show the movies
underground?
No. No, no. They show
them aboveground, but they...
It's really intellectual.
They show intellectual films.
So like an
intellectual film festival?
I just think,
do you do commercials?
'Cause those are my favorite.
- No. No, he doesn't do commercials.
- Mmm-mmm. No.
Really? I just think
that is just the height...
...of the art form these days.
It is just short and punchy,
you really gotta just...
...zing the ideas on in there.
That's why
I watch TV these days.
I just think it's so...
That's why I watch...
I mean, it's better
than the shows now.
Well, he makes
documentaries, so...
- It's different.
- Yeah, but I mean...
I think that I've seen
documentary commercials.
I don't think they have to be...
...limited to any
particular thing.
It's not a...
You know, I mean,
the starving artist thing...
...just never made sense to me.
I just think you should
consider it, Tariq.
Sure.
That's no fair!
- Give it back.
- That was mine.
Stealer.
So, Erin,
are you still in school?
Um...
Yes. I am.
I'm in my final year.
I'm finishing my Master's.
- That's great, good for you.
- In what?
In literature.
Wow!
So, were you
a student of Crispian's?
I was. But I'm not anymore.
- Not anymore.
- Mmm-mmm.
She was my TA, but we
stopped, because we figured...
...that that was inappropriate.
It's a little unprofessional.
What?
What's that?
What you just said.
What was that?
About what?
You said it's unprofessional.
Is there something else
you wanted to say to me?
No, I was
just agreeing with you.
You weren't agreeing with me.
I mean, I... What he...
I thought he said
it was unprofessional?
Don't look at her.
I'm right here.
- Crispian.
- What?
We're having a dinner here.
I'm having a conversation
with my brother.
Is there something that you want
to say, because I feel like...
What are you...
I don't know what you want.
I don't think
that you're in any position...
...to be judging
my moral decisions.
Who says I'm judging you?
You are, with
your eyes. I'm tired of it.
Oh, it's a big
semantics conversation.
The whole time
you've been here...
...you've been needling me,
and I'm not putting up.
with it anymore.
I'm tired of it.
- You are so jealous of me.
- I'm jealous of you?
Boys? Do we have to
do this at the dinner table
- right now? Please, I...
- No, no, Mom. This is good.
I'm jealous of you?
Really?
Always, what have I done?
What the fuck is that?
Look in the mirror!
You look like The Elephant Man.
What do you mean?
What can you not believe?
Go ahead and tell me what
you can possibly not believe.
What could possibly
come out of your mouth...
...that's even
remotely interesting...
...or of merit or value?
I mean, I've had enough.
Oh, my God!
Crispian!
Help me get her up.
We have to get out of here!
Aimee, no!
Mom, get down!
Get away from the window!
Drake!
Is he all right?
Oh, my God!
Aubrey, get down!
Get down, get down, get down!
- Stay down, stay down!
- Get down, get down!
Stay away from the windows.
Get down!
Crispian! Get Drake
and get over here.
Drake! Stay down!
Someone fucking do something!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's okay. It's okay.
Look at me. Look at me.
You're gonna be fine, okay?
Just stay down.
Okay. We gotta call 911.
We're all gonna die!
- I don't have a signal.
- I don't have a signal.
I don't have one, either.
- Does anybody have a signal?
- I don't understand this...
I had a signal today. I was
able to use the phone today!
Dad! Dad, they must be
using a jammer.
- What?
- A cell phone blocker.
They're illegal,
but you can get them...
...on the Internet
for like 30 bucks.
Felix, you fucking low-life!
What are you calling me
a low-life for, man?
I'm just trying
to help the situation.
That's no fucking surprise...
...you're into that sketchy shit.
Oh, my God! We're gonna
fucking die! Oh, my God!
Crispian! You're gonna
grab your brother...
...you're gonna carry him
out of this room right now!
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
Okay. You're gonna
grab this chair.
Get yourself out of here!
Cover your face and run!
Stay low! Go!
Aimee, go!
Grab the chair! Go!
Aubrey? Aubrey?
Aubrey, Aubrey.
No, I can't! No!
I'm here with you.
It's gonna be okay.
Come on.
Let's go! Ready?
Go, go, go!
We have to pull
this out, right?
Yes.
Somebody pull it out!
Pull it out!
No, no, no, no.
No clipping, no pulling.
Can you just gently
place your hands...
...over the wound slightly?
That's it.
Breathe!
No, no, no, no.
Don't do it.
- No. Stop!
- I'm sorry.
Drugs, babe!
Come on! I need drugs!
My purse.
Someone hand me my purse.
Stop moving!
Keep your hands on it, please!
No, don't!
Stop!
Oh, my God.
What is happening to us?
- What the hell is going on?
- I have no fucking idea.
Dad, do you see anyone?
I don't see anyone.
Do you see anyone?
- No.
- We need to do something!
Somebody should make a run
for the cars...
- Or try to go get help!
- No! No!
We can't go out there.
Mom, it's the only way.
It's the only way
we're out of this.
Whoever's the fastest runner.
- Who is that?
- I am. I am.
I'm the fastest,
but I've got this...
...fucking arrow in my back.
What does
your shoulder have to do
with your legs?
I'm the fastest.
He has a fucking arrow
in his back!
Stop yelling at me, Kelly!
How the fuck
do you know it has to do
with your legs if you never
run, you fat fuck?
I'm not fat anymore!
Damn it!
Shut the fuck up!
I'm the fastest!
You guys never...
...give me any credit
for anything!
Look, it's not about that.
Nobody needs to run.
- We need to all stay inside.
- You don't believe in me!
We don't know how many people
are out there.
Honey, we believe in you.
We believe in you.
I can run three miles in
23 minutes. I'm gonna do it.
Aimee, no! No!
Aimee, you can do this.
I believe in you, okay?
You just have to get out where you
can make a phone call to get help.
Zee, help me move this.
Help me get this
out of the way.
Felix!
I can do this, Daddy.
Get down!
We'll pull the doors
open at the last second.
They're not gonna be
expecting her...
...to be coming out full speed.
Help us! Help me!
Aimee! Help me! Baby!
What happened? What happened?
Aimee!
Oh, my God. My baby!
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, no!
Oh, my God!
Oh, no. My God.
Erin!
What are you doing?
We need to make sure
all the doors...
...and the windows are locked.
What?
Babe. Hey.
What are you doing?
Some places, if you text 911,
they get it as a voicemail.
If you even have one bar
you can send a text. Come on!
Those things are useless.
I'll have it keep trying.
Okay, the second floor
is clear. Should be safer
- than down here.
- Aubrey, honey, come on.
- Come on. Come on.
- No.
- Oh, my God, no.
- I'm taking her upstairs.
That's a good idea.
Drake, we need to take care
of this shoulder.
It's fine.
I can't feel it anymore.
Are you sure?
Don't touch it.
Don't touch it.
Okay, we're all
gonna get out of this.
We need to cover up
and lock all the windows.
I've never seen you
act like this before.
Well, it's a unique situation.
We still need someone
to go outside...
...and try to get some help.
No, I think
we should stay in here...
...and lock everything, and wait
till the police come by.
In fact, we should hang a sign...
...out an upstairs window,
SOS or something.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
I can pull a sheet
off the bed upstairs.
We're almost there.
Come on.
Stay with me.
I have to go check on the kids.
Get out of the way!
Move!
Oh, my God.
Mom.
Oh, no. No! No! No!
Oh, God! No!
No! Aubrey!
No!
I have to go see her.
I have to go see her!
Dad, Dad. No.
Stay down here.
Stay down here with us.
Why would anybody do this?
Oh, my God!
Kelly!
No, Drake!
Drake!
Kelly!
Fuck!
What happened?
Help!
Somebody help me!
Somebody help! Help me!
- Can you grab a rag?
- Yeah, okay.
Maybe we should try to run.
I mean, Kelly made it.
At least get to a car
or something.
I'll try. I'll try.
You guys stay here.
No, no, no. Wait. I'll come
with you. Zee, hold this.
But we'd have to carry Drake.
And Dad, he...
He can't run right now.
I'll go get the car.
I'll bring it right up
to the front door.
Then you and Felix and Zee
carry Drake and Dad out.
Make sense?
Babe, it'll be okay.
I can do this.
It'll be just a second.
Honey?
Take this.
Hello? Sir? Sir?
Let me in!
Let me in! What the fuck
is wrong with you?
Open the fucking door!
Unlock the door!
Let me in!
I think it's safe to assume the
other cars are out, but...
I didn't see anybody out there.
Maybe Kelly...
Maybe she got past them.
I mean, it gives us a chance.
What do you mean?
I'm going back out there.
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, I didn't see anyone.
Maybe it's over.
Wait, so what, you're just gonna
leave the rest of us here?
Clearly, we need
some help, man.
We need to get somebody
out there in here.
I'm gonna go to the neighbor's.
As soon as I'm
a safe distance away...
...I'll try to text and call.
You guys stay in here.
Keep each other safe.
I'll come back.
I'll come right back.
Wait, Crispian.
Don't go. I'm serious.
Everything's gonna
be fine out there.
You just stay in here.
Take care of yourself.
I'll come back soon,
okay? Okay?
You promise?
I promise.
See you soon.
I think it's safe to say at least
one of them's already inside.
You think the person who killed
my wife is still in this house?
I'd assume so, yeah.
How is he, Zee?
Looks like
the bleeding stopped.
Let's get him in there,
hide him someplace safe.
Felix, can you give us a hand?
On three.
One, two, three.
What's the best room
for us all to be in?
I don't know.
All the rooms have windows...
...in them,
except for the basement.
No, the basement's a bad idea.
They could just pour gas
down the stairs...
...and throw in a match.
We should stay in there and
keep boarding up the windows.
Shit, speaking of.
Okay, we should each
carry a weapon.
Anyone know this guy?
Although it's kind of
hard to tell.
Hey. I'm sure Crispian's fine.
Crispian's a tough guy.
No, he's not, but thanks.
Thanks for the help,
by the way.
Hey, you... You seemed
to have a handle on it.
Yeah, don't worry about it.
Hey, where's your dad?
Where's the circuit box?
I don't know. I... I think
it's in the basement.
Why don't you
go look for it there?
I'm gonna go upstairs
and try to find my dad.
- Dad!
- Felix!
One of them was in the bedroom.
They've been
watching us for days.
While we were sleeping.
This wasn't a random
attack, Felix.
Dad, it's okay. Okay.
- Yeah.
- Calm down.
You understand what I'm saying?
Our family is being targeted.
Really? You had to do that
right in front of me?
Are you sayin' something?
Yeah, you know what?
Never mind.
You okay?
Yeah. I just...
I just need to get washed up.
Hey.
Whoa! Whoa!
I woke up in there.
Yeah. You blacked out.
We put you there to hide you.
Thanks.
Welcome.
Where's Kelly?
Um...
I don't know.
Are you guys okay?
What's going on?
We heard noises,
so we stayed upstairs.
What happened?
One of them came in
and attacked us.
I stabbed him
and he ran away. Come on.
You stabbed him?
Yeah.
Do you think
you might have killed him?
No, he ran out the door.
Was there anyone upstairs?
We didn't find anyone.
Whoever was there could have
climbed out the window.
Is your dad okay?
Yeah. He... He just
needed to lie down.
How many of them
do you think there are?
There'd have to be
at least two more of them.
Well, maybe they're gone.
Maybe you scared them off.
Come here. Let's not
count on that. Come on.
There's some tools
left in the basement...
...that I think we could use.
Let's head down there.
Okay. Grab anything
sharp or heavy...
...that might make a good weapon...
...but you need to do it fast.
We've gotta be upstairs.
Yeah, let's...
Let's go through Dad's tools.
There's plenty of stuff
we could use there. Come on.
Zee, can you grab these?
Okay. That'll be enough
to get started.
Let's go.
And don't take too long!
Drake doesn't need
to see her like this.
Zee, let me show you
something quickly?
Okay, so you just
want to make sure...
...that the nail goes
all the way through.
- See that?
- Mmm-hmm.
Just do, say,
four or five on this one?
And we'll just do
as many as we can.
Okay.
Can I ask you something?
How did you learn
all this stuff?
Well, I had kind of
a weird childhood.
I grew up
on a survivalist compound.
I haven't even
told Crispian that yet.
Good answer.
Well, I guess when I was born,
my dad got kind of paranoid.
He was just convinced
that the world
was gonna run out of resources
in a matter of years.
Found a lot of guys
who agreed with him...
...and we all moved
to the Outback.
I mean, basically,
if things got...
...too overpopulated,
even out there...
...he wanted me to be
able to take care of myself.
Moved to the States
with Mum when I was 15...
...but learned a lot beforehand.
Wow. That's crazy.
Got some things here.
So nobody knows
where Crispian is?
No, he... He ran out
right after Kelly did.
I gotta go look for them.
I at least have to try.
I can't leave Kelly out there.
What do you mean?
Drake, Kelly's dead.
What?
Kelly's dead.
You didn't know that?
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
I didn't want to have to
tell you like this...
...but she got killed.
Her body's up there
on the floor right now.
Drake, I'm sorry. I...
Shut up! Felix!
- I know you cared about her.
- Shut up!
Shut up! Stop talking!
I'm sorry.
Would you just die already?
This is hard enough for me.
- Finished that one?
- Mmm-hmm.
Cool. You know,
it might not be a bad idea...
...to do at least one more.
I'm gonna go check
on their dad upstairs.
And when the boys come up, make sure
they have some rope or something.
Uh, I can do it.
I can go.
Do you wanna come with me?
We can go together.
No, that's okay.
I'll just do another board.
Okay. Be careful.
Oh, fuck!
Oh!
Oh, you motherfucker!
Oh, fuck!
Hey. Would you mind
checking on that?
I believe this is what
I'm paying you for.
Thanks.
What a fucking disaster.
It's okay, baby.
It'll be over soon.
I'm not really in the mood
right now, Zee.
Come on.
I'll make it quick.
I want you to fuck me
on this bed...
...next to your dead mom.
What?
Why would you even
say something like that?
You never want to do
anything interesting.
I don't think
that's a fair criticism.
Fuck me next to your
dead mom, then.
This conversation is over.
Hmm.
Fuck.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait! Don't do that!
You don't want your
DNA in here, man.
I'll clean it up later.
Just like the rest
of this fucking mess.
Excuse me? You say that
like it's my fault.
Listen. Just so
we're perfectly clear:
I just had to kill
my own brother...
...because you guys keep
getting beat up by some girl!
I had to stab my brother,
more than once!
You were supposed to do that.
For all the good
you guys did in here...
...you could have stayed outside
with your fucking crossbows!
You wanna talk about brothers?
That's my brother,
laying dead right there.
And unlike you,
I liked my brother.
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't know that.
I mean, I knew you guys
served together.
I didn't know
you were related, though.
Man, she really
fucked him up good, huh?
I'm just trying
to think of reasons
why I shouldn't kill you!
I'll... I'll pay you more.
What's that?
You kill me, you get nothing.
You pull this off,
I'll give you $400,000.
Okay? I was supposed to
give you $200,000, right?
But you should
have your brother's share.
That's only fair.
Plus, I'll throw in
an extra $100,000. Each.
If we can finish this. Okay?
That's half a million for you.
And $300,000 for you.
I'm looking at...
I won't...
I won't be able to pay you...
...until my inheritance
comes through...
...but I'll have it soon.
We just need to finish this!
We did make it this far, man.
You two better be getting
enough money to pay us!
Would I be
doing this if I wasn't?
I got it.
Get up! Get after her!
Get after her!
Hell, the cops could be driving here
right now, for all we know.
Well, what if they
come across her...
...running down the road?
Did you even think about that?
You need to calm down.
Don't fucking tell me
to calm down, Tom.
This entire situation
is out of control.
We don't even know
what's going on.
She's hurt.
She's not faster than us.
You just stick to the road.
You don't see her,
you come back here.
Well, where are you going?
Back to the house
to check on Craig...
...and to make sure
she's not doubling back.
Wait, give us the crossbow.
Look, you got your machete.
We don't have any weapons.
What are you
standing there for?
Give it to me!
You know how to use that thing?
Yeah, I know
how to fucking use it.
I pull the trigger,
arrow shoots, right?
Two bolts. Two shots.
You see her, you make it count.
Of course.
Shit.
What the fuck?
I fucking hit her,
didn't I? Get in there.
Give me the crossbow.
Come on!
All right.
I'm right behind you.
Okay.
God damn it.
Fuck!
It's not even hot,
you dumb bitch. Whoa!
<i>Felix?</i>
<i>Hey. Felix, is it all done
in there, or what?</i>
<i>I saw my signal came back.
Is it over?</i>
Look, I know
you're pissed at me...
...for not helping out.
I just...
<i>I couldn't do it, man. I...
I told you this might happen.</i>
I saw Mom, and the blood,
and you know I'm a pacifist.
I can't... I can't deal
with the violent stuff.
Come on, now.
I can hear you breathing...
...on the other end of the phone.
Felix?
It's... It's fucking
freezing out here.
I'm coming inside.
Felix?
Felix?
Erin, you're okay!
Where's Felix?
I stuck a blender
in his head and killed him.
Oh.
Okay.
I can't believe
you were in on this.
Come on, babe. You do know
how broke we are, right?
You would have killed me.
No! That was
never supposed to happen.
Well, even if you
hadn't meant to kill me...
...you must have known
I could have died.
No!
You were supposed
to be the witness.
A person with a clean record,
that could attest...
...that our family and neighbors...
...had been murdered
by unknown lunatics.
It was, in fact,
a very important part...
...of my plan
that you be unharmed.
We needed someone
with no motive...
...to see what had happened here.
Someone other than Zee,
obviously.
Where is Zee?
I killed her, too.
Ah.
Totally understand.
Listen.
I'm sorry things got
so out of control...
...but, um, how were
we supposed to know
...that you were, um, really
good at killing people?
Which is actually
sort of weird, by the way.
Had you reacted, um, normally...
...my parents and siblings
would have been killed...
...you'd have been untouched...
...and we'd be rich.
We'd be on our way to,
like, a vacation in Paris.
Maybe an engagement?
Okay. Okay.
There is a silver
lining here, by the way.
I'm now the sole inheritor
of my family's estate.
We're talking millions, babe.
You. Me.
Us.
Look.
Regardless of
our current situation...
...or whatever
we're going through right now...
...it would be insane
to throw that away.
I mean, look at all
that would be wasted.
I understand it might...
...take a while
to make this up to you.
But in the meantime...
...let's think
about this logically.
I know you've got
your student loans.
How would $500,000 go
towards fixing that problem?
You could quit
your bartending job...
...just study full time.
You know you hate that job.
You could have $500,000
within the month.
Or, I go to jail...
...and you get nothing.
Hey.
I love you.
I promised you
that I'd come back, didn't I?
Here I am.
Why?
Why the fuck not?
Oh, fuck.
We need medic and backup...
...immediately
at 5 Edelweiss Drive.
No! Don't!
