Good morning, Mr. Bryce.
I trust the pickup
ran smoothly.
Handoff was clean.
No stops till the exit
point.
Clear roads
all the way, Chief...
just as you predicted.
Thank you for agreeing to
an earlier departure time,
Mr. Kurosawa.
I'm honored
that you and your wives
have entrusted a Triple A
Protection Service today.
Moving red to green option
coming in on your vector.
Get the engine started.
I want immediate takeoff.
Air space has
already been cleared.
Roger that.
All channels moving to
restricted air space.
Shall we?
Mr. Kurosawa...
Safe travels.
Thank you very much,
Michael.
Another Triple A delivery, sir.
Stay with him
till he's airborne.
Yes, sir.
Canvas is clear?
Nothing for miles, Chief.
Almost boring.
And what's our motto?
Boring is always best.
Move! Move!
Client down! Client down!
Code 7! Code 7!
Jesus!
It's like
a goddamn milkshake in here!
Bravo 1 down.
We need
a clean-up team in here now!
Repeat, Bravo 1 down.
Fucking
piece of paper I've got here.
I don't have fucking time.
Holy shit.
Mr. Seifert.
-Are we ready to go?
-Are we ready?
I've been waiting!
What the hell took you so long?
It's half past nine!
Apologies. I had to make
some preparations.
Mr. Seifert.
Mr. Seifert!
It's best if I go
through doors first.
I don't think you know
what I'm dealing with here.
Come on, let's go, let's
go.
-Let's go. Double time.
-These people are animals!
They're probably--
they're probably here already,
just--
just waiting for me to leave.
I can appreciate your
concern,
but I assure you,
you are perfectly safe.
All you need to do
is exactly what I tell you.
Mr. Seifert?
Mr. Seifert?
This way, please.
All right, is it not enough
cocaine, or too much?
They say
you're Triple A rated.
Is that a real thing?
Let's just focus on you
dying of natural causes,
shall we?
Soon.
-That's my car.
-Take a mental picture of it.
I find it safer
if we're using a car
that blends in
with the surrounding traffic.
Well, that was easy.
In fact, practically
nothing at all.
-Boring is always best.
-I trust you'll reduce your--
What?
This is Michael Bryce.
I'm an executive
protection agent,
fully licensed and bonded
within the EU.
Fuckin' hell. I know it's you.
I've got caller ID!
Such a fucking dick.
You got a pickup
for me or what?
Yes. I've extracted my client
from 27 Saint George
Street.
Cleanup is required.
On the seventh floor,
north stairwell...
I've left a French
national
employed by
the Taray Crime syndicate.
You'll find two more
in the south stairwell.
On the roof,
you're gonna find another
who's gonna need
some dental work.
In the alley,
there's two gentlemen
who may require
some counseling.
One more in the east
office,
on the sixth floor
under construction...
and one on
the number three elevator.
Oh, oh, oh, parking
garage,
under the Rolls Royce
in space five...
there's a pound
of plastic explosives,
so you might want to
call the bomb squad.
Check that.
Make it the fire department.
-Is that my car?
-I'm afraid so.
Have a seat,
it's been a long day.
That was a custom
Rolls Royce, one of a kind.
I thought that was
an unusual color.
Was that periwinkle?
I did find this
in the backseat.
-Scraps!
-Precious, aren't they?
-It smells like ass in here.
-Buckle up.
This car certainly
isn't Triple A rated.
It's not even fit for
animals.
I apologize
for such an unexpected
late visit, Professor.
You're always welcome,
Mr. President.
In your house
with soldiers, yes.
In your classroom,
I've been told I'm less popular.
Nothing is more important
than a good education.
How's your English?
I don't know much English,
Mr. President.
"The only way
for the country to progress...
is by eradicating
the scourge of genocide
blackening our country
and our livelihood."
I appreciate your modesty.
I hope we're not
disturbing your family.
They are on holiday.
Well, good for them.
Family makes a man whole.
I could have you
executed for treason...
but another would simply
stand a little bit higher
on your corpse.
There must be some other lesson
I could teach you.
As I said...
there is nothing more important
than a good education.
Professor Asimov,
can you please tell the court
what happened next?
Then I was taken...
to one of Dukhovich's
internment camps.
I was there
for three years...
until he was finally
overthrown.
Arrested for
like the monster he is.
Thank you,
Professor Asimov.
Your Honor, I request
that this entire testimony
be disregarded.
Without any evidence,
this is merely hearsay.
Sustained.
The trial
of former Belarusian President
Vladislav Dukhovich...
continued today with
emotional testimony from
many of his country's
victims.
But while powerful to hear,
Dukhovich's attorneys
say...
they are nothing more than
the lies of his enemies.
Long one of the world's
most brutal dictators...
Who stands accused of
ethnic cleansing
on a massive scale.
An unprecedented
level of security is in place
around the courthouse.
Even the airspace
above this city is closed.
So far, the prosecution
has been crippled...
by the lack of any hard evidence
against Dukhovich himself.
Numerous witnesses
who were expected to testify
have disappeared.
Is there anyone brave enough
to come forward with
evidence...
and finally put an end
to his brutal reign?
Mr. Kincaid,
this is Interpol's offer.
In return for your
testimony
against former President
Dukhovich...
your wife will receive
a full pardon
from all jurisdictions.
You're going to pardon
an innocent woman?
That's mighty
fucking white of you.
Assuming we accept
this arrangement
for Sonia Kincaid,
there's still the matter
of an agreement
regarding my client.
He will receive...
this letter...
recommending leniency.
Mr. Kincaid
is a contract killer
facing two dozen counts
of murder in 10 countries.
Absent a legitimate deal,
he will never breathe
free air again.
Under no--
Sonia goes free.
We're all set,
Director Casoria.
Let's get this gentleman
to The Hague.
Mr. Kincaid,
this is Agent Roussel.
She'll be leading
the security detail
which will escort you
to the International
Criminal Court.
You know,
Dukhovich's men have killed
every single witness
brought against them.
And my security detail
is a dozen off-duty cops?
These are the most
highly-trained officers
in Europe, Mr. Kincaid.
We have taken
every precaution
to make sure
that your involvement
is completely classified.
Oh, it's a secret?
Oh, that makes me feel
so much better.
Well, I can assure you,
even if there was an attempt...
we're more than prepared
for any assault.
Were you prepared
for that assault, motherfucker?
Uncuff me, give me
some car keys,
a couple guns,
I'll meet you guys there.
The court's deadline
is at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow,
Mr. Kincaid.
That gives us 27 hours
to transport you from
Manchester to the Netherlands.
If you want to help your
wife, you should get moving.
Okay, Inspector Clouseau,
let's see what these
elite troops of yours can do.
Come on, guys, let's go.
Agent Roussel,
I don't have to remind you
of the importance of this.
No, ma'am.
And don't doubt
what he's capable of.
I won't, sir.
Take a left
on Kirkland Avenue.
Yes, sir.
What a pretty little town.
Old narrow streets...
buildings nice and
close...
lots of great views
from all those windows.
This route's
been wiped clean for us.
Nothing to worry about.
Is that right?
How's that nose of yours
doing?
Take diversion route.
Got a boyfriend, Roussie?
Significant other?
I need you
to be quiet, Mr. Kincaid.
I'm just saying,
now might be the perfect time
to write one of those
"I'll always love you" texts.
Relax, motherfucker.
If you hear the shot,
it wasn't meant for you.
221, 10-4 on route.
- Fuck!
- Move! Move!
We've got more on the roof!
Move! Move!
Rob, get that door open!
Go! Go!
Alpha Squad with me!
Agent Roberts,
protect the witness!
Parker, take the left
flank!
-Shit!
-We need more backup!
Fuck!
Agent Roussel!
Goddammit, somebody!
We need backup now!
Turn around!
Lay down some cover fire.
Oh!
Fuck!
-Show me your hands!
-Bitch, please!
-Put these on.
-Fuck that.
Interpol's compromised.
You know that.
Either you shoot me
or watch me bleed out.
We gotta get off the
street.
There's a safe house
not far from here.
A car bomb
has exploded in Bishopsgate,
near Coventry City Center.
Don't even think about
answering that fucking phone!
The only way Dukhovich
could've known our route...
was if he had somebody
on the inside.
Now, I need medical
supplies, and you need help.
So, if you're gonna
call somebody,
they have to be totally
out of the loop.
I've had
the Black Diamond service
four times now,
do you understand?
Four times.
The car still smells
like a cemetery.
Are you washing the car
with old assholes?
Or-- just help me to
understand.
Just a second here.
Hello, Amelia.
I'm texting you
an address in Coventry.
You need to get there
immediately.
Bring three units
of O-Negative blood.
I'm doing very well,
thank you.
How are you?
I don't have the time
for this, Michael.
I have a job
I need you to do.
Aah, pass.
I wasn't offering.
I'm telling you.
I have a job
you're going to do.
I'm not gonna let you
charm me into this one, Amelia.
Okay, let's be clear.
I'm not any happier
about this than you are,
but I don't have a choice.
- Well, thank God I do.
- No, Michael,
you don't.
Because if you're not
where I need you to be,
I'm going to expose you
and your work to Interpol.
That elite Triple A status
you want back so badly,
I'll make sure
you never get near it.
Oh, you're threatening me
now?
Not you, her.
Are you threatening--
you can't just threaten me
into taking orders from
you.
I guess we'll find out.
You're three hours away.
I'll see you in two and a
half.
Okay, okay.
I guess we will.
Jesus Christ.
Here, we're gonna load
all these into the car, okay?
We're gonna take the car
out in the front,
and then
we're just gonna burn it.
Ma'am, this place
is like a war zone.
We got bodies everywhere.
Our unit's compromised.
Everyone's down.
Get those guys ID'd.
And I've got no sign
of Agent Roussel.
Maybe 15 to 20 dead
mercenaries, heavily armed.
Media circus is in town,
but that's not the worst of it.
Kincaid is gone.
Coventry,
every available agent.
Report back to me
with any updates.
Yes, ma'am.
There must've been a leak.
I told you,
there are
too many agencies involved.
Get to The Hague.
See what you can get
out of Dukhovich.
I'll try.
And alert
the penitentiary in Amsterdam.
Have them triple the guard
around Kincaid's wife.
Got it.
Mrs. Kincaid,
your attorney.
Did I tell you
you could turn around?
What do you want,
you useless piece of shit?
Oh, baby, baby, it's me.
Oh, my bad.
What do you want, you fucking
hijo de puta motherfucker!
I just wanted to
hear your voice.
Fuck you!
There,
you heard my voice.
The only reason
I'm in this shit hole
is so that they can get
to your sorry ass!
How you doing?
You made a shank yet?
- What for?
- It's prison, baby.
You got to protect
yourself.
It's a Dutch prison,
Darius!
What are they gonna do,
beat me with a clog?
Oh, you got a view at
least?
Just a whole lot of
corny Dutch buildings.
There's one with
a huge fucking clock on it.
Like that's what
I need right now.
Do they have
those flowers you love?
Uh-mm! Irises?
They come from there,
right?
Fucking tulips, Darius.
What kind of
a piece of shit husband
doesn't remember his wife's
favorite flowers?
You never remember
anything.
What's our anniversary?
I'm gonna make this
up to you, baby.
You see, that's
what
I'm talking about, cabrón.
Darius,is something wrong?
Not a thing, baby.
Not a fucking thing.
Then I wanna hear it.
♪ 'Cause you know
Just what to say ♪
♪ And you know
Just what to do ♪
♪ Let me start by saying
I love you ♪
-Hello?
-Hello?
-Sonia?
-Darius!
You fucking shit!
Go ahead, you might as well
finish the job.
-Why am I here, Amelia?
-A high value transport.
Oh, high value?
Oh! I don't--
I don't really do
high value anymore.
I mean, these days,
I'm more in the mid-level
coked-out attorney market.
Why do you think that is?
Seriously, Michael?
Because of you.
You used me to climb
the Interpol ladder,
and here we are again.
Whoo!
You up for a promotion?
You have to blame me
for every little bump
in your road, don't you?
No, these aren't bumps.
No, no, no bumps.
Just one dead
Japanese arms dealer.
Which I had
nothing to do with.
Do you know what
happens...
...when a Triple A rated
executive protection agent
loses a client?
Triple A.
I was up here, yeah?
Then I opened up to you,
why wouldn't I,
I was in love with you.
And I fucking told you his
name.
It was the first time
in my entire career,
I revealed a client's
name.
I trusted you.
Ba-ba-ba-ba... bump!
Now I'm down here.
The dead guy's up here.
I'm sorry, Michael,
you hit a rough patch.
A rough patch...
A 300-pound
investment banker's ass
exploded four bags of
heroin
in the backseat of my car
last week.
Those aren't leather seats,
those are cloth.
-Okay, Michael--
-Take a minute
-to grab a mental image--
-I don't have the time
-to hear your insane shit!
-At a certain point,
-you just sell the car.
-I never betrayed you.
I never used you!
I just left you!
Because you couldn't forgive me
for something I didn't even do.
-Transport--
-Transport is in there.
Is that blood dude--
What the fuck?
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for this?
No, no, no.
I'm not gonna look.
Oh! Motherfucker!
Hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's talk about this,
okay?
Even a dumbass like you
is smart enough
to keep one in the pipe.
Oh, shit.
And nighty night.
Darius Kincaid.
Jesus Christ!
This is who
you want me to protect?
--Look at my shirt!
Shut up for two seconds!
Fine, fine.
You get the feet,
I'll get the nostrils.
The trial
of former Belarusian President
Vladislav Dukhovich...
took an uncertain turn
this week,
having recently survived
a dioxin poisoning attempt
that left his face disfigured.
Authorities are keeping
Dukhovich...
Interpol wishes
to have a word.
Quite the dust-up
in Coventry this morning.
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?
You've come here
to lodge a complaint?
I've come for my money.
I delivered as promised.
I gave you Kincaid as
exposed as you'll ever get him.
Small security detail,
practically a rookie
leading them.
I can't do more than that.
Let's be fair here.
You think it's fair
to want something for nothing?
In my country...
we would skin you like a
cat.
Would that be fair?
I come from nothing.
I work all my life...
serving the people.
And then, they come
into my country
and they took it all away!
And now, they lock me up
like a rat...
feed me poison!
Is this fair?
When Kincaid is dead...
you'll be paid in full.
You know
he's a murderer, right?
You're playing nurse
to a murderer.
- A witness.
- Really?
-Hmm-hmm.
-27 times.
That's how many times
this asshole's tried to kill me.
27-- 28!
Fucking Prague!
If Dukhovich is acquitted,
he'll be back in power
next week.
-I won't let that happen.
-Good.
You should take him
to The Hague.
I can't!
There's a mole inside
Interpol.
It's already cost me
12 good officers.
Good?
That's subjective, you
know.
Nice. Maybe they were
nice.
I'll make it
simple for you.
If I stay near him,
they'll find him.
So I gotta risk my life
protecting
this coffin magnet over here?
No, no, no, no!
You gotta put something
-in the pot for me, okay?
-How about your career?
-How about it?
-Your precious career.
You do this job for me...
and I'll get you back
to elite status.
Yeah, you don't have
that power.
I've got connections.
You want back in the big game,
I can put you there.
Why would I trust you?
Why?
Because I've never
lied to you, Michael.
You're terrible
at almost everything...
but you're good at
keeping people alive.
Keep him alive, please...
and you get
your dream life back.
And as a bonus,
you'll never hear from me again.
Good.
- That's bad.
- I don't speak French.
Still.
Shame.
Shit!
Where are you?
Setting up operation
at Coventry police headquarters.
You got nothing
from Dukhovich?
Are you surprised?
-Ma'am?
-Busy.
Yes, ma'am,
but I've picked up activity
at our safe house in town.
Is this something
I need to know right now?
No, not normally.
But yes, it should be vacant.
And you believe it's not?
Well,
the access code was activated
without identity
authorization.
Could Kincaid
have gotten inside?
But it's on
a revolving encryption.
Get a team over there.
Now!
And where is Agent
Roussel?
- Sorry, got to go.
- Good luck.
I believe I know
where Kincaid is.
I know this Darius Kincaid
we're talking about.
I want proof he's dead.
Proof? Like a photo?
Like a head.
-What the fuck is all this?
-You're a fugitive.
-Fugitives wear restraints.
-No, no, no, not the cuffs.
I'm talking about
these whack ass
hipster clothes I'm
wearing.
-Yeah, luckily I brought extra.
-Lucky for who?
Ah, shit.
Am I wearing underwear?
Those are for me too,
in case I have to
change your pants again.
Not a fan.
You know they call them
swinging dicks for a reason.
How about we never
speak of this again.
Shit.
Interpol protocol.
When that phone rings
and nobody answers,
they're gonna send officers
to the door.
And there they are.
Yes,
we're setting our perimeter.
Comfy?
So, what happened
to little Miss Interpol?
- Agent Roussel's gone.
- Oh damn!
I liked her.  She's
spunky.
This building has
two stairwells, no fire--
Escapes
and no adjacent rooftops.
You know, you're not
the only observant motherfucker
on the planet.
I go through doors first.
I check to see if it's clear,
then you follow.
Really?
You think that's necessary?
My job is to keep you
out of harm's way.
Shit, motherfucker.
I am harm's way.
Split up
and take different floors.
Split up and take
different floors.
Two hostiles, maybe more.
I don't suppose
I could have a gun?
No. We're gonna take
the north stairwell.
Let's go.
No! You fuck!
Oh! Thank God, you're
here.
I don't know what
I would've done without you.
Well done.
Guess what happens now?
Shots fired! Shots fired!
All units send in a 9-9.
Now we have a new problem.
I like to keep things
a little more subtle.
Quick,
they're heading for the roof.
See, boring is better.
Okay.
That's very loud.
It was empty anyway.
We have two heat signatures
on the rooftop
moving
in a northbound direction.
Copy that! Go, go, go!
They're on the roof!
No, no, no.
No odds in that jump.
Well, it beats the hell
out of whatever's
gonna come through that
door.
No. Just gotta--
We just gotta find
a more intelligent way--
Oh! Motherfucker!
Shit!
Holy fucking shit.
Secure the roof!
Go, go, go!
Delta squad with me!
They're on the north side!
Copy that!
Made that jump on one leg.
I made that jump
without jumping.
Let's go.
So, what's your next
trick,
showing me how we escape
without escaping?
Let's just try
to get to the car
without killing anyone,
all right?
- Is this your car?
- One of them.
I remember
shooting at you in a Jaguar.
Buckle up.
If we get in a high-speed chase,
I want you strapped in.
I'm more worried
about the wheels
coming off this bitch
when you reach the speed limit.
You know, back in the day,
we wouldn't have even stolen
this piece of shit...
and we stole everything.
I remember one night--
I know
all I need to know about you.
All your early arrests...
your father
in and out of prison,
you following
in the same footsteps.
Did your
little research, did you?
Well, prepare for a test,
so there are no surprises.
Hmm, and you grew up
wanting to be a cop...
till you found out there wasn't
no money in that shit.
So you joined the CIA,
sharpened your skills...
then decided to open
your own shop,
pimp yourself out
to the fat cats.
I didn't even have to do
no research to know that shit.
It's written
all over your punk ass.
Can't wait to hear
what I'll do next.
That's great.
You know, why don't--
Why don't you lay back
and keep from getting spotted,
huh?
Get comfortable.
That's a good idea.
Ooh-hoo!
Smells like ass back here!
Bet that Jag
never smelled like ass.
Oh! These your
electrolytes?
Darius has gone.
Nothing but cops out here.
Facial recognition
identifies this man
as Michael Bryce.
But you already know that,
don't you, Agent Roussel?
-You two have a history.
-Long time ago.
You slipped Kincaid
into our own safe house
then brought in this--
Executive protection
agent?
Official channels
had been compromised.
What did you expect me to
do?
Clearly, our office security's
been breached.
The red notice stays.
You, however, can go.
I'm placing you on leave.
You will surrender
your weapon and credentials.
You are going to be telling
this story for years, Amelia...
from inside
a very large office...
or a very small cell.
Well, I like my odds.
The only way Bryce and Kincaid
don't make it to The Hague...
is if they kill
each other first.
Amelia.
-She's making a mistake.
-We need to plug our leak.
Now, this Bryce,
do you trust him?
With something
like this, yes.
I'll speak to Casoria,
get her to allow you
to come to The Hague with us.
But no more secrets.
Thank you, sir.
Search for car,
plate FJ56MHV.
They'll have identified
the car
with the traffic cams by
now.
And you.
Welcome to fugitive life.
Until I turn you in.
Just need to find
a different vehicle...
older model, no alarm.
Right here.
Luckily, I came prepared.
You know,
if you're gonna be a while,
I can just go in there
and get a room.
There's an art
to low impact, high efficiency
breaking and entering,
but--
-Art's objective.
-And you're bleeding again.
You know, for a dude
that runs around killing people,
you've got this really strange
thing about bleeding.
It's inefficient.
And I don't kill people,
I protect them.
Hector Ramirez.
Hector Ramirez
was an assassin.
Yeah, I know.
I trained him.
Who was holding a knife
to my client's throat.
And you killed him.
No. I saved my client.
I think Hector might have
a different perspective on that.
Oh, is that so?
Well, here's the thing.
I was a Triple A rated
executive protection agent.
You just made up
that Triple A bullshit.
No, I did not!
And if guys like you,
sociopaths like you
weren't running around
trying to kill my clients,
then no one would get
hurt.
Triple A, yeah,
it sounds like you ought to be
selling life insurance
or fixing my fucking
transmission, or something.
Well,
you're uninsurable, trust me.
And you said
"was".
"I was a Triple A,
x-rated dickhead!"
Get in the fucking
car!
Get in the fucking car!
Jesus fucking Christ.
You definitely said "was".
"Was" as in, "I used to be
a Triple X dickhead
driving a Jag...
but now I'm rolling around
in this shitwagon."
Put your seatbelt on.
What happened?
Lose your edge?
Drop focus?
You slip up and let
a client get popped?
Never slipped up.
Well, how did "am" become
"was"?
I don't--
I don't actually know.
I mean, how does
the so-called expert assassin
get busted by Interpol?
Love, baby.
Straight up love.
See, I'm doing this job
in Geneva, right?
Some dude washing
the wrong dude's money.
I get a call.
What?
My wife's been
in a car accident. A bad one.
What?
So, Geneva dude gets a pass,
I jet back to Mexico City...
go straight to the
hospital.
Bopped up in Sonia's
room...
two dozen agents
waiting for me.
Played by the heart.
Happens to the best of us,
man.
I mean, sort of like
how Agent Roussel took you
from here...
to here to here.
Oh, assassin
and eavesdropper.
That's a real--
You're a real double threat.
Well, you were whining
like a bitch so loud,
I heard you through the
wall.
Agent Roussel and I
aren't any of your concern.
So, she dumped you because
of all your tight-assed...
boring is good,
look before you leap,
put your seatbelt on shit?
She didn't dump me.
Oh, motherfucker,
I know she dumped you.
I'm just perusing
all the reasons why...
and there's a plethora
of those motherfuckers.
-Plethora?
-Yeah. It means a lot.
I know
what plethora means!
It just doesn't apply
here!
And not jumping off
the top of a roof,
that's logical,
that's safe.
You know, wearing a seatbelt,
logical, safe.
Let me ask you something,
how many times
have you been shot?
-Counting today?
-Yeah.
Ooh! Too many to count.
You?
Zero.
Now, we both know
that's bullshit.
That's not bullshit, okay?
This was a little flesh
wound.
You just kind of
zinged it right there.
Didn't even require a Band-Aid.
You got lucky.
Yeah, the rock shifted
just as I took the shot.
You're a lucky motherfucker.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fucking Prague.
Yeah, Prague.
You never even took one
for a client?
Nope. Never had to.
Yeah, but the question is,
would you?
See,if I'm paying
Triple A rates,
then I'm looking for
that full-service shit,
you know what I'm saying?
That extra A
stands for Ass, yours,
between mine and a bullet.
Being prepared
for everything...
- means that that situation...
- Bryce, you cannot
-be prepared for everything!
-statistically just won't occur.
You know, life is
gonna bloody us up, okay?
You just gotta put a Band-Aid
on that shit and keep rolling!
That's really beautiful,
man.
Do you ever just
write stuff down, you know?
Maybe, I don't know,
throw down a haiku or two?

How'd you like that,
motherfucker?
Do you have any idea
how stupid you sound?
I mean, what a fuck up!
You lost my husband,
and you're like,
"Can you please
help us find him?"
Why the fuck should I?
That is your fucking job,
motherfucker!
But, obviously,
you suck at it.
You received
a phone call today
from your attorney.
So?
Well,we asked your
attorney
but, he said he didn't have
any contact with you.
What?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Okay, that's it!
I've had it with this lawyer!
He's an alcoholic.
He calls me completely
drunk...
and he starts saying
the most inappropriate things.
Like, for example,
what he likes to do
to his wife's ass?
That is a disgusting place
to hide a child's toy!
And you know what?
I don't need to
listen to this shit!
Then he forgets about it,
but I'm stuck with
the images in my head!
Mrs. Kincaid...
if you know
where your husband is,
you need to tell us.
It's for his own safety.
I'm sorry.
You're worried about
my husband's safety?
No one in this world
can kill Darius Kincaid.
The man is a cucaracha...
and I mean that
in every sense of the word.
Sometimes you just want to crush
his little filthy head
with your shoe...
but he won't die.
That motherfucker is unkillable,
so you can relax.
But wait, no.
There is one important thing
that you should know.
I shit on
your whore of a mother,
and I shit on
your whore of a mother!
Motherfuckers,
get out of my fucking cell.
-Great.
-Now!
And I want that lawyer
fired!
I want that lawyer fired!
I want a good one,
professional lawyer!
I have rights!
Human rights!
Okay, you can take
a five-minute break.
Good evening.
Can I help you?
We need to see your
cameras.
Sorry, sir,
that's for management only.
The others
have picked up a signal.
I got you!
-Where we at?
-I backtracked west.
-West is the wrong direction.
-Thank you. Thank you.
They'd be expecting us
to take a direct route.
What the fuck
is that you're eating?
Postpones fatigue.
Refuels glycogen
and electrolytes.
I got you one, too,
while you were taking
one of your world-class naps.
I'd stay awake
if you let me drive.
That's really generous of--
No!
-I gotta piss.
-Use that.
Timeline's not built
for another break.
Your dick might fit in here,
but mine...
Plus, I need
every drop of this shit
to tolerate this ride with
you.
Just pull the fucking car
over.
Jesus Christ.
It'd be a lot easier
without these cuffs,
or this fucking underwear.
Kincaid!
Hey, asshole!
Fucking goddammit,
that's not mud!
-You think I'm a fucking idiot?
-Well...
You did think
that cheap whiskey was piss.
Oh, fuck!
Where the hell
did that come from?
This is what happens
when you mess
with a perfectly laid plan.
-Give me a gun.
-I got this!
-Give me a goddamn gun!
-I got this!
-There's more than one.
-Perfect deduction, Sherlock.
Draw their fire
so I can take a look.
All right. Go!
Shit! Okay.
Three shooters in a row,
all lit up.
So, what do you want to
do?
While you can't come up
with a plan,
they're gonna come down here
and kill us.
-So here's the plan.
-What the fuck?
You take 11:00,
I'll take 1:00.
Let's see who gets to 12
first.
Okay. On three.
You ready?
One--
I said on three.
You shot early.
Yeah, before they did.
Let me break it down--
So much for your intricately
calculated travel plans.
That's why I was trying
to bounce on your ass.
See, I'm safer on my own.
There's no way that they
could've known where we were.
Well, they did,
and now they're dead.
This yours?
Is this your cell phone?
I might've taken that
off some dead merc.
You might've--
You know,
they can track a cell phone.
That's why I use
a ghost chip in mine,
so they can't track the
phone.
I mean, that's how they know
where we were!
Here I am, I'm plotting courses
all over the country...
and you're carrying a location
beacon in your pocket!
-My bad.
-Your bad?
You don't even understand how
21st century technology works!
I mean, how have you
stayed alive this long?
While all you guys
are wasting your time
planning and aiming
and deducing...
I just do my thing,
and my thing has always been
better than your fucking thing.
Great. There you go.
That's just great.
I'm glad that your thing has
always been better than mine.
You're not gonna
take this gun?
No, you keep that gun.
Use it to shoot me.
No, I was gonna shoot you
with this--
Shit!
There goes the guns.
Well, look on the bright side.
We get the bad guys' van.
This field
smells like your car.
Dude, I said I was sorry
about the phone.
Who knows, maybe your plan
would've worked.
And what about
your other plan?
There's no plan!
The plan is
we're in a cow pasture,
that's the plan.
I'm talking about
your Agent Roussel plan.
That's why
you're doing this, right?
To get her back?
You think becoming a Triple-A
card-carrying dickhead
is gonna give you
an all-access, backstage pass
to Agent Roussel's ass,
and she'll fall in love
with you...
Oh, I get it. I got it.
You're gonna be the guy...
and your life will have
meaning again.
that the other inmates
come to for advice.
Well, they're very lucky.
Motherfucker, please.
I've eaten hamburgers that know
more about women than you.
You, my friend,
are a romantic retard.
Hey!
Just 'cause I want to get
my business back in order,
that doesn't make me
a shitty person.
And Amelia has nothing,
absolutely nothing,
to do with this.
Oh, man, you are so in love,
it is crazy.
Christ, do you ever shut
up?
Huh?
Why is everything
always about love with you?
What else is there?
I mean, take away
the guns, the money...
the travel,
the perfect shot
through a motherfucker's
ear hole from 300 meters.
I mean, none of that shit
means dick
if I can't tell Sonia about
it.
Well, I guess Amelia's
just not as special as Sonia.
She sounds great.
-What, she cheat on you?
-No.
-Try to kill you?
-No.
'Cause Sonia
chopped off part of my ear
with a machete one time.
She sewed it back on,
but...
it was two, three days
before our shit got real again.
Where'd you guys meet,
Christian Mingle?
No. A bar in Honduras.
One of those places
where nobody knows
your face and name.
I'd just come off a job.
Some dude kidnapped
the wrong dude's daughter.
I was sitting there
chilling,
when I noticed this waitress
getting hassled by these guys.
I got up to help her
when she unleashed
the most amazing display
of violence and beauty...
I had ever seen.

Lights.
-Need a ride?
-Yeah.
We're trying to catch
the ferry to Amsterdam.
Yeah,
I can get you there.
-Yeah?
-Jump in.
Hey, there's eyes
all over Amsterdam for me.
That's where Sonia's locked
up.
It's quick in and out.
I got a place there.
You got a place in
Amsterdam?
Yeah.
Is that where
you keep the Jag?
You know what?
Why don't you go fuck yourself
and the horse you--
- Hello.
Hello, beautiful Sisters.
Whose lap will I sit on?
Here's the
phone.
Ivan says Kincaid
is still on the move.
If God wishes a man
dead...
...Ivan will find him.
And if God's not ready
for Kincaid to die?
Make sure the back-up plan
is in place.
One more!
Your stop, boys!
You take care, sisters!
Bye, Kincaid!
Go with God!
This man's killed
over 150 people.
250, easy.
Yeah, but they love you.
Me, they want to
perform an exorcism on.
Question for a higher
power.
Who is more wicked,
he who kills
evil motherfuckers...
or he who protects them?
You really believe
you're the good guy?
My first contract, I
was...
I don't know, 16, 17.
There was a guy
who broke into a church.
The preacher was still there,
so he told the guy...
"Look, you don't have to
steal anything.
Take whatever you want."
Dude wasn't there
for the loot.
He wanted to hurt
somebody.
Slaughters the preacher,
displays his body on the altar
for his congregation to see.
The Bible says
never to take revenge...
to leave it to the Lord.
But I wasn't prepared
to wait that long.
So, when your moral compass
gets around to pointing at me...
yeah, you'll be pointing at
one of the good guys.
And how does
one of the good guys
get connected with
a piece of shit like Dukhovich?
I didn't know everything
the dude was into.
That's an easy excuse.
Look, you know everything
about every client
you ever had?
Nope. I don't--
I don't decide whether
my clients live or die.

Oh, come on.
He changed the codes on me.
Son of a bitch.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
When's the last time you paid
rent on this safe house?
I haven't done a lot of
Amsterdam jobs lately.
I just need to get my
gear.
The problem is that
all the windows are Poly-Carb.
They have extra layers
of laminate...
and obviously there's
a Hetzger alarm system...
which is the premiere unit
on the market.
It's got three fail safes.
But, if I can just--
-Jesus Christ!
-Nope. Darius Kincaid.
But there are no words.
I am amazing.
Oh, that's so cute!
You look so happy here.
So, is Agent Roussel
the only photograph-worthy girl
in your life?
Been busy working.
Oh, ho, ho!
You must give me
your designer's number.
We got four hours to court,
let's get cleaned up.
I need to change my bandage
and take a shower.
The hot water still work
in this bitch?
Upstairs.
-Elevator?
-No!
Fuck!
Counsel,
approach the bench.
How can you allow
Kincaid's testimony?
A hired killer
given a sweetheart deal.
A man like that will say
anything to save himself.
Kincaid has
no sweetheart deal.
His wife will go free,
not him.
The testimony
will be allowed...
assuming you produce
your witness by 5:00 p.m.
Michael,
you should've been here by now.
Yeah, yeah,
just a couple bumps.
We're on our way.
The judge isn't
giving us any wiggle room.
You have less
than four hours now!
Well, we're gonna
be there in half that.
Then why are you calling
me?
Right. Well...
I'm calling you because
I've been thinking, and...
I forgive you.
Yeah.
It feels good to say that.
I forgive you, Amelia.
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-What?
You're seriously
doing this now?
-No.
-And forgive me for what?
-What?
-There's nothing to forgive!
-No, look, I thought that you--
-Just get Kincaid here!
Fucking prick!
Darius?
Fuck!
Yeah.
We've got
the whole area covered.
If Kincaid shows up,
he's ours.
-Stay alert.
-Copy that.
Everyone
keep a close lookout.
Understood.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, tulips.
That will be $25.
Easy.
Ay, mi cucaracha.
You couldn't just have
the flowers delivered, huh?
Needed a personal touch.
Well, you were about to
get his personal touch,
if I hadn't followed you.
All right,
I appreciate that.
And the guys who started
tracking you a few blocks ago.
Oh, you mean the guy
you snatched in the bush,
and the two you left
knocked out in the park?
Like I said,
I appreciate you.
So, you knew
that they were out there...
but you still felt
it was important
to deliver these flowers?
Sonia's gonna really love
those flowers.
I sure fucking hope so.
Now, this is as close
as I'm gonna be to her
for a very long time.
It had to be special.
First. I'm first.
You were saying?
Tell me something.
The day you and Agent Roussel
took that picture,
I saw in your place...
what kind of things
would you have done for her
to make her happy?
Anything.
I loved her.
Trusted her.
-She sold me out.
-Huh!
-Case closed.
-Well, that's cold.
Maybe, just maybe...
you ought to give her
a pass on this.
I mean, I gotta tell you,
honestly...
there's not a lot of women
in this world
who'd put up with your
shit.
That's inspirational,
thank you.
What I meant to say was...
there's no women
who would put up with it.
You're an annoying motherfucker
with all your rules and shit.
I mean,
if she can put up with that,
she must be
a pretty special girl.
She is.
You know, I told her today
that I forgave her.
-Really? And how'd that go?
-Hard to tell.
You know, women don't
like to be forgiven for shit...
'cause that implies they did
some shit, to begin with.
I should just forget
about Kurosawa.
-What?
-Takashi Kurosawa.
He was my client,
she exposed him,
and he got killed.
Something funny?
She didn't expose
your client!
I popped Kurosawa!
I was at the airport
for another target.
I spotted him by accident.
Lucky for me,
him, not so much.
Doubled my money on that corrupt
Asian motherfucker.
The single most awesome...
shot I've made
in my entire hitman career.
300 meters through a firm
C-cup tittie-sized window.
Pow!
Hey, I thought you knew
I was the one who popped him.
Oh, shit!
What the fuck, Bryce!
We're done!
That shit
was two years ago, man.
You gonna be
a little bitch about it?
-You're on your own!
-Well, good!
I'll be safer on my own!
You won't last
one hour without me!
You'll be dead in a
minute!
Yeah, you're about as
useful
as a condom in a convent.
- Eat my ass!
- That's what she said!
- Suck it! Suck it!
- Fuck you!
Fucking pussy.
Fuck!
Do you have any idea
how prepared I was?
No, not really.
No. Every possible scenario
I had covered,
every kill shot...
every-- every angle.
And he fucking ruins my life
with one lucky shot
through a window the size of a--
Just a--
That's him.
There he goes again.
Shots fired!
Shots fired!
I hope they kill him.
I really do.
Okay.
Even if I did save him,
again,
you know what he'd say?
He'd say that I had it all
figured out before he got here.
He'd say, "I guess my
thing
is just better than
your thing, motherfucker."
"I guess bullets are just
allergic to me, motherfucker."
This guy singlehandedly
ruined the word "motherfucker".
Do you know how hard
that is to do?
I was Triple A rated
executive protection.
Sure.
I was up here.
I was up here.
And goddamnit!
There he is!
- Hi.
- Oh, geez!
Get rid
of the Interpol car!
Requesting all units,
heading south!
Sorry.
Move! Move!
Move! Move!
Move! Move! Move!
Goddamnit!
Who are these guys?
-Go, go, go, go.
-Turn!
Shoot him.
Hit the
brakes!
Watch out!
-Drop your weapon!
-This way!
Fuck!
Interpol! Interpol!
Fuck!
- Shit!
Fuck!
It's two hours
until the deadline.
How are we doing?
Goran has the bodyguard.
I'm going to
interrogate him now.
No, I need you here
in case Kincaid shows up.
Goran will make him talk.
Okay.
What kind of asshole
wears a helmet this tight?
A loose helmet is like
wearing no helmet at all.
It's not a button strap.
It's a D-ring.
Just unthread it through
the thing, it's very simple.
Oh, well, or there's--
there's that shortcut.
Ew!
I ask you one time,
polite.
Where is Kincaid?
Honestly,
I'd tell you if I knew.
You have my word.
Look at my right hand.
See that?
That's a Boy Scout salute.
We're sworn to never lie.
I've taken an oath,
so you can trust me.
Ahhh!
Right in the fucking ear!
Waterboarding? Really?
I was in the CIA.
You know,
we don't do that anymore.
Okay. Hey, hey.
Hold it. Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.
Here's what we learned.
The key to
interrogation...
is establishing a bond
between the interrogator
and the subject, okay?
You know, just sort of like
a rapport, okay?
You need me to like you.
You need me to like you,
okay?
You need me to like you!
I really don't like you.
Okay, okay, okay.
-Where is Kincaid?
-He's right behind you.
Scout's honor. Fuck!
Fuck!
Hey listen,
before you start talking...
'cause I know you're gonna
start fucking talking...
I just want to apologize for
laughing about popping Kurosawa.
I know that shit cost you
your girl and that...
fake-ass, made-up Triple A shit
you keep talking about.
No, it was all my fault.
No...
I did it all to myself.
Bryce, please! Come on,
you didn't do it to yourself.
-That's life. Life happens.
-Life without Amelia.
Hey, still time
to work that shit out.
So, how'd you
and Agent Roussel meet?
On a job.
She was...
She was working
an undercover op...
very badly.
I was at a client's funeral.
Massive heart attack.
I can protect someone
from bullets and explosives,
but there's nothing I can
do
against indiscriminate use
of mayonnaise
for 68 straight years.
Technically,
I was still on the payroll...
so I was in the building,
paying my respects.
Amelia was there with some
of her other Interpol agents.
They were hoping to
bust my client's
shady and
mayonnaise-chugging brother.
Instead of doing things
nice and quiet...
they got marked,
and their target runs.
Oh, yeah.
Leave it to Interpol
to turn a really fun funeral...
with lots of delicious
hors d'oeuvres...
into a depressing carnival show
of total unprofessionalism.

Breaking news
from The Hague suggests
that if a credible witness
cannot be produced
within the next hour,
the former president of Belarus,
Vladimir Dukhovich,
will walk free
and resume power.
This would be
a spectacular embarrassment
for the international
community...
and a crushing blow for the many
relatives who alleged that...
They're out there...
waiting for us to make
the first move.
I know I would be.
-I should've told Amelia.
-Told her what?
That I'm a stupid man.
Hey, what if I told you
I couldn't protect you?
I'd say you're right.
We'll just go
to Amsterdam,
I'll help you get Sonia
out...
and you give her
those flowers in person.
No fucking way.
I gotta help you get back
that Triple A shit I fucked up.
The guilt's killing me.
Dukhovich,
that motherfucker's gotta go.
Well, it's not gonna happen
unless we get there.
-Shit, I'd bet on them.
-Normally I would, too.
I got a hot tip.
There's a couple of
ringers in the game.
We got our choice of
wheels.
Hmm!
That's a good-looking Jag.
Yeah. I guarantee you,
if that smells like ass,
it's supermodel ass.
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.
She blends right in.
Ohh! That's responsive!
Jesus.
You know, I have a pen
knife.
It's just that the gearshift's
on the right-hand side here,
and I'm not used to that.
-It's practically impossible--
-Get out of the fucking car.
A three-day
adjustment period
to figure this out.
Motherfucker,
I will bust a cap in your ass
if you don't give up that
wheel.
Have you ever said
please or thank you--
Please, motherfucker!
-Why are we always yelling?
-Get out of the fucking car!
Fine.
Time's just about up.
No sign.
They vanished in Amsterdam.
Dukhovich is free.
Michael would never
let that happen.
It appears you're wrong
about your Michael Bryce.
- Hello?
- Hey.
Michael, where are you?
We're a couple minutes
out.
Look...
I wanna tell you
that I'm sorry.
I wanna say
that I'm sorry for...
for everything.
For Kurosawa, us,
it's all my fault.
You know, I act like a--
I act like a fucking child
around you.
And I can't admit
that it's my fault,
and I project that onto you,
and that's not fair.
You deserve better than
that.
That's
them!
Why are you
telling me this now?
Well, under the circumstances,
it seemed like a good time.
-We got company.
-Huh?
We have them.
Blue Ford C-Max on Route 44.
Let's go!
Amelia...
Amelia...
- I just want to say that--
- I love you.
Jesus Christ!
Really?
What happened
to the seatbelt rule?
Oh, fuck!
-What the fuck, man!
-Move your fucking car!
-Michael? Hello?
-Who this?
Agent Roussel, hold on,
let me put you on speaker.
-What happened to Michael?
-He had to bounce.
Excuse me. Sorry.
You know,
he really cares about you.
He has a hard time
processing emotions and shit.
But one thing his fucked-up
brain has figured out,
he really loves you.
Are you
in the middle of something?
Well, actually, yeah, I
am.
Look, we'll call you back.
Watch out!
Okay, you had--
If you wouldn't mind...
the gun.
Yes.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Yo! You about done?
Tick tock, motherfucker!
He's fucking unkillable.
With just
five minutes remaining
before the court's
deadline,
the case against
Vladislav Dukhovich
is almost certainly
doomed.
Suspicious vehicle
is approaching, Commander.
Stop the car!
What's going on here?
Is this what
we've been waiting for?
Shit.
I got your witness,
Darius Kincaid.
Follow me.
Obviously, Your Honor,
this has developed
into a complete waste
of my client's time.
The prosecution
has no witness to present.
Can you empty
your pockets, please, sir.
Are you kidding me?
Come on!
As we seem to be
reaching our deadline,
I have no choice
but to declare
that this trial
has come to its natural--
Your Honor,
I present Darius Kincaid.
The deadline has passed!
I believe we still had
a few seconds on the clock.
How do I look?
You got a little
speck of blood on your...
everywhere.
Will the prosecution
please prepare their witness.
-Hi.
-My God, are you okay?
Yeah.
There's your guy.
-Thank you.
-Yeah.
By the way,
bumping into you
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.
Do you swear
to tell the truth,
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?
Yeah.
Your name
is Darius Kincaid?
No. My real name
is Darius Evans.
My parents separated
when I was six.
My mother remarried
a real mean piece of work
named Roger Kincaid.
She figured if I took his
name,
he'd keep his belt on
more often.
Plan didn't work so well,
but the name stuck.
My real father's name
is Maurice Evans, preacher.
He was killed a few years
later in his own church.
- I'm sorry, I didn't--
- That's all right.
Can't research everything.
Mr. Kincaid,
were you ever in the employ
of Vladislav Dukhovich?
-No.
-Have you ever met Dukhovich?
Yes.
April 17, 2012,
he invited me to his palace.
Prosecution Exhibit 17-D,
palace security logs.
Did he offer you
employment then?
Yes, he did.
He wanted me to take out
a political rival
exiled in the UK.
- I refused.
- Why?
Because while I was there,
he ordered his men to slaughter
a village outside Polatsk.
I'm not down with killing
innocent people.
And do you have evidence
to corroborate this?
Yeah.
Go to FTP site Raven 257.
-Just load it up.
-Exhibit 18-D.
We've confirmed
the coordinates.
It's asking
for a password.
Oh, sorry.
Password...
Dukhovich is a dick, all caps,
except "dick" is lowercase.
I wasn't gonna trust
Interpol with this shit.
Order!
Order!
Order in the Court!
Your Honors...
I could save us all some
time.
May I address the court?
Initiate
alternate measures.
For months,
I have been sitting
in this chair...
nodding along
to this ludicrous charade.
Excuse me.
My excellent attorney
was hoping for the legitimacy
of a formal acquittal...
but that is no longer
possible.
Thank you, Darius.
So, let us now end the
charade.
The charges against me...
are entirely correct.
I am the rightful ruler
of Belarus!
Mr. Dukhovich, sit down!
As the ruler of my nation,
I will do as I wish,
without exception,
without apology.
I recognize no authority
-that limits my power!
-Mr. Dukhovich, I order you--
-Assistant Director.
-Go do your job, Amelia!
In this trial,
the world community is
attempting to make a statement!
Well, now I would like to
make a statement of my own!
Show me your phone.
I recognize no authority
that limits my powers!
Everybody, go!
I will now take my leave
with my dignity intact!
Now that's what I call
Triple A service.
Fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Medic! Medic!
I need a medic over here!
-Lockdown protocol!
-Don't move!
We're here live
in front of the ICC
in The Hague...
where a truck bomb
has just plowed
into a crowd of
protestors.
Emergency!
It's a critical health
situation!
We need immediate
air and ground support!
Focus on me, Bryce.
Bryce! Focus on me.
I'd really rather not.
All units. All units.
Stay with me, Bryce.
Stay with me.
I did my job.
You go do yours.
Go! You gotta go
get that motherfucker!
Freeze!
On your knees.
Tower, AirMed 1
requests priority clearance...
to restricted zone
for casualty extraction.
Officer,
the building is in lockdown.
Dukhovich does not
leave his cell.
Let's go!
It's over, Assistant Director.
Give up.
I didn't want to
do this, Amelia.
I swear to you.
Oh, fuck!
Michael! Michael!
-Michael, you hear me?
-Are you okay? Yeah?
-Yeah.
-Good, good, Good.
You? Oh, no.
-You're bleeding.
-Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine.
I'll get some help.
Stay here.
Take her
down!
Ahh, ahh, ahh!
Up on the ledge,
Dookie man.
You heard me, bitch!
Up on the ledge!
The look on your face.
You're so proud.
Darius Kincaid...
about to be a hero,
save the day.
None of that matters.
There is no redemption,
no atonement
for a man like you.
Your whole life has been
but a trail of corpses...
and I will be just another
dead body on the pile!
Go ahead! Finish me!
But don't think for a moment
it will change what you are.
I don't give a fuck
about all of that!
You fucked up when you
shot...
my bodyguard.
Who?
Dukhovich.
It's Dukhovich.
Okay,
here's what I'm thinking.
Celebrity security.
It's low stress.
Boy bands and shit, right?
One of those guys gets
killed,
nobody's getting
all that mad at me.
-Well, we'll figure it out.
-We will?
Yo!
What a brother gotta do to get
arrested up in this bitch?
Can't someone
just Taser him?
I mean, like,
a non-lethal Taser.
Director Casoria.
My deal still good?
You definitely held up
your end, Mr. Kincaid.
Agent Roussel,
why don't you go find
Mr. Kincaid some handcuffs.
With pleasure.
You were right
to trust your instincts.
Well done.
Thank you, ma'am.
-You're welcome.
-For what?
I got you a front row seat
to the Roussel show...
and I got you that all-access
backstage pass
to that ass
you've been wanting so bad.
You did what?
Well, you know, when you
jumped out of the car...
-I gave her the 411 on you.
-I didn't jump out of the--
I went through
the fucking windshield.
-Semantics.
-Semantics?
Semantics.
Yeah, just another way
of saying the same thing--
I know
what semantics means.
I also know that I don't need to
take love advice from you.
Oh, really? So tell me
how that love life shit
was going before I showed
up.
You know,
she's gonna be right back,
and that's it.
Last chance to run.
I'm going along
with the program
till Sonia's free.
Then I do my thing.
You really think
it's gonna be that easy, do you?
Motherfucker, please.
You know when I want
some shit to pop, it pops.
Like that shot through
that tittie-small window
on Kurosawa's plane.
Okay,
that's enough out of you.
Show me the face you made
-when that shit went down.
-That still stings, all right?
I know you wasn't
expecting that shit to happen.
Yeah,
I was expecting you
to blow my client's head
off.
Did you have
that "Home Alone" face,
like ooh!
Do you guys
have handcuffs?
Do you have any?
A worldwide red notice
was issued today for
contract killer Darius Kincaid.
Kincaid has escaped from
Her Majesty's prison Belmarsh.
The notorious hitman
is almost certainly armed,
and considered
extremely dangerous.
