Come.
Detective Chief Superintendent Butler, sir.
I hope you can explain
the bloody shambles of this so far, Butler,
because your Commander Hatherill
has singularly failed in that respect.
Now he wants to put you in charge.
I'll be running the investigation
a little differently, sir.
Millen tells me you're known as One Day.
Cos that's how long it takes you
to catch criminals.
I wouldn't know about that.
You understand
whose money these blackguards stole?
The banks', sir?
The Queen, man.
Her Majesty's Mail.
Every single note
bears the likeness of our sovereign.
This is not just a robbery, this is an attack
on the very cornerstone of England.
And you, Butler, had better remedy that,
very rapidly indeed.
I'll do my best, sir.
I have to assure the PM
you're the man for the job.
Otherwise it'll be my job, my judgment,
that Will be questioned.
And I do not plan on having
my judgment questioned, Butler.
There's been quite enough of that already.
Quite so, sir.
Right, I'm putting you in charge
of the investigation
but I shall expect immediate progress,
One Day.
Of course, sir.
And now an update on the mail train robbery.
Despite the Postmaster General
offering a £210,000 reward
to the first person giving information
leading to the apprehension and conviction
of the persons responsible for the robbery,
police have as yet failed to make any arrests.
Tom.
- Afternoon, sir.
Do they know?
- Not yet.
As you've probably heard, the Prime Minister
is yelling at the Home Secretary,
the Home Secretary's
yelling at the Postmaster General
and all of them are yelling at me.
We need this fixed, Tom.
Very fast.
Mr Millen, can I ask what you're doing here?
Who are you?
- Daily Express.
What the hell are you doing here?
DCS Butler, isn't it?
You've got the national press
in the middle of your incident room.
Well, there's been a huge amount of interest.
We are five days on.
Why don't we know who's responsible?
We've given C11
a list of nicknames the thieves used.
We're waiting for the results.
In the meantime,
we've got roadblocks across the county.
The thieves told the train staff
not to move for half an hour,
so we're searching a radius of 30 miles.
Where did you start?
Pardon?
Did you search outward from the crime scene
or inwards from the SO-mile perimeter?
Outwards from the scene.
Well, it's all very well in hindsight...
- All right, Malcolm.
All the indications are
this is a London gang.
You only have jurisdiction
up to the county line.
As of now, the Flying Squad,
DCS Butler here, runs this case.
What about us?
- You'll run the operation:
paperwork, the exhibits and the press.
I don't talk to the press.
We'll nick them, and bring them to you.
It won't just land in your lap.
Come.
Sir, we've had a tip-off.
Call from a local farmer.
We think he might have found the hideout.
27 miles from where the train was stopped.
Not visible from the road. The perfect hideout.
Don't let anyone in other than a police officer.
- Sir.
Stay on this spot till you're told otherwise.
- Yes, sir.
How much is it?
2,631,784.
Is there any grub left, please?
I'm starving.
Get rid of any signs it was ever here.
I didn't think we'd nick that much, did I?
It wasn't supposed to be
the crime of the bleedìn' century.
They're looking for military.
We 're making it look like a brick van.
Afternoon.
Afternoon, Tom.
Hope they've left me some nice dabs.
Lotto do, Morris. First-class job mandatory.
I'll make sure you have whatever you need.
I don't want to be at trial and hear you
wanted another week, or three more men.
What you get here
has got to convict those bastards.
A job like this must have been
planned down to the last inch.
But it's a mess in there.
Why leave the place in a state like this?
What happened here?
Any idea who's behind it?
Not yet.
Well, gentlemen, shall we get started?
How many do you want?
- Six.
Six? You sure six is enough?
A big job.
- Sure.
And who do you want?
Frank Williams and Steve Moore.
Seen this?
Jack slipper and his DS, Neville.
Tommy Thorbum.
And Lou Van Dyke.
Sid Bradbury to run the office.
We're five days behind
and we haven't even started.
Talk to your informants.
Who was away those days?
Who's been missing since?
Who's been keeping an unusually low profile?
Snouts Will know.
The whole squad is ready to
give priority to train robbery inquiries.
If you need something, you'll get it.
If you don't, tell me.
Why are we the chosen ones?
It's a London job.
Most likely south of the river.
You lot know the manors,
the characters, the histories.
You've got the contacts.
This'll come down to information on the street.
How is our list of suspects?
Right now, a yard long.
MacArthur's tipped off C11
with a list of nicknames. They're working on it.
If you believe what you read in the papers,
it's an aristocratic loner IRA mastermind
behind this.
I don't want to hear about the papers. Ever.
Sid here Will run the office,
log the calls, the leads.
Maurice Ray is on forensics
at Leatherslade Farm.
Early turn is officially 9am till 5pm.
I'll expect you here till at least 10.
Late turn is 2pm till 10pm.
I'll expect you started by nine.
Yeah, nice one.
You think I'm joking?
You try turning up late
and see where your bollocks end up.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
This was a large gang.
And we Will nick every single one of 'em.
Starting now.
Right, you slippery little turd.
You know what I'm after, names.
Names, or I'll run you in fast...
What have you got for me, then?
19. 19 names, sir.
11.
Four.
Nine.
17.
32.
32?
Very enthusiastic snout.
My snout reckons criminal activity's
all but at a standstill.
Lot of pissed off villains out there,
cos we're all over them.
Cross-reference the names,
see which ones come up most.
What about your list, guv'nor?
The one from C11.
You were checking the results.
Whose name's on that list?
John Thomas Daly,
Douglas Gordon Goody,
Roy John James,
Bruce Richard Reynolds,
Charles Frederick Wilson.
Bloody Reynolds. Makes sense.
Sense of what?
- We've been tailing him for a while.
Had him marked
as being involved in safe-blowing raids.
We picked up a mate of his, Billy Still,
a while back.
Past few months, Reynolds has been going out
on a motorbike. Buckinghamshire direction.
Whereabouts?
- We never found out.
Whenever he was on the bike,
we couldn't tail him without being spotted.
How long ago was this?
Well, six months. Maybe longer.
We fancied him for the airport robbery
at Comet House an' all.
Who did he meet?
Goody, Wilson, James.
All pan of the same firm.
South London boys.
Frank, bring me
everything you've got on Reynolds.
Let's have those names, boys.
Right.
Er, early thirties, Battersea boy.
Got an interest in an antiques business,
but that's just a front.
What's his form?
In and out of trouble since he was a lad.
House-breaking, shop-breaking,
two stints in borstal.
Lasted four days on National Service
before scarpering, ended up in Wandsworth.
Various thefts, more time in the Scrubs.
What sort of thefts?
Handbags, two overcoats, eight pairs
of slippers and a portable wireless.
What was his last conviction?
30th May this year.
Poaching.
Poaching?
- Yeah.
10 quid fine. Ongar Magistrates Court.
10 quid.
And you think he fixed up the train robbery.
Give it here.
Yeah, but the thing is,
he was only ever nicked for small stuff.
But he's got a reputation for classier stuff.
Odds on he was part of the BOAC airport raid,
maybe even the ringleader.
We were told him and his firm
were planning something.
That's why we put a tail on him.
One question then.
If this Reynolds was the potential ringleader
of the airport robbery
and if you think he's the brains
behind the train robbery
and if you had a tail on him,
how come we haven't got a bloody clue
where he is?
I want him in my cells, Frank. Now.
Get on it. Go on.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure you don't recognise anyone?
No.
Is that the train driver?
- Yeah.
He's not picking anyone out.
Says it was too dark,
and they were all wearing balaclavas.
Well, that would make things difficult.
Poor sod.
Taking a whack like that for doing his job.
Have you checked known addresses
for Reynolds and his firm?
No sign of any of them.
Good.
Nothing says guilty like a disappearing act.
Mug shots of suspects, up here.
Sir.
How did they get hold of that farm?
Mr Field,
Leonard Field,
came to me...
Ooh, I'd say on or about the 21st June this year.
He had the particulars of sale from Midland
Marts, the agents for Mr Rixon, the Vendor.
I did the conveyancing. Leatherslade Farm.
It's all here.
Your clerk, Brian Field,
introduced Leonard Field to your firm?
Yes.
But they're not related?
No.
No. No relation at all.
Complete coincidence.
I suppose you could say it's a funny thing.
How did Brian Field know Leonard Field?
I believe they met in connection
with the trial of Harry Field, Leonards brother,
over horse doping.
Would you have expected Brian Field to view
Leatherslade Farm with Leonard Field,
prior to purchase?
No.
Yet he did.
The owner, Mrs Rixon,
has a very clear memory of it.
Unusual for a solicitor to accompany a buyer
on a first viewing.
Perhaps Mr Field wanted a second opinion.
Leonard Field paid the deposit money to you.
£555 in cash.
Which you then paid to Midland Marts.
Standard procedure.
Did you issue Mr Leonard Field with a receipt?
What? Sorry?
A receipt for the transaction.
I don't see one in this file.
D'you know, I can't remember.
You wrote to the vendor's agent
requesting vacant possession
on Leatherslade Farm
upon exchange of contracts
rather than completion.
I did.
Possession normally occurs on completion,
not exchange.
Why was this different?
The purchaser wanted to carry out
extensive redecoration.
He wanted to start as soon as possible.
And you signed the contract
on Leonard Field's behalf.
He didn't sign it at all.
All absolutely legal.
You represented Gordon Goody at his trial
for the BOAC airport robbery.
I believe we did.
And that he was acquitted.
PC Milner?
Afternoon, sir.
Exhibits officer. Aylesbury sent me.
They said you needed help.
- Yes. This whole area needs scouring.
Look around, see what you can find, lay it out.
Any prints, palms, fingers, boots or feet,
let me know.
Right, sir.
Yes, sir.
- Carry on.
Good lad.
Mrs Clarke?
- Yes?
We've come about the garage to rent.
We rang earlier. Saw the ad
in the newsagent on Castle Road.
Yeah. Do you live locally?
No, but we're often in Bournemouth
on business. it's ideal for us.
Oh, no, I prefer to rent to people
from the area, really.
What about if we agreed a slightly higher price
than you mentioned in the ad?
Oh, I don't know...
Three months' in advance?
That would all be in cash.
That's what, seven pounds,
10 shillings, all upfront.
Now.
Let me get you the key.
Roger Cordrey, florist from Brighton.
And Mr William Baal.
- Yeah.
Now, the woman who owns the garage
is a policeman's widow.
So as soon as they'd gone, she called in.
We went down to the garage,
they scarpered separately.
We chased them down and brought them in.
Did they leave anything in the garage?
- They did. Austin A35 van.
Baal had the keys on him.
And we found this inside.
Bloody hell.
Did you count it?
256,047. In ones and fives.
Those are the keys Baal had on him
when he was arrested.
There's an address here.
Where'd the money in the suitcase
come from, Roger?
Feller I met at Brighton Races.
Name?
- Freddie.
Freddie what?
Just Freddie.
You met him before?
- No.
Seen him since?
- No.
And he gave you all this cash?
Yes.
You'd best tell him we've got it then, hadn't you?
Got an address?
Is everything all right?
Yeah, fine.
You don't look fine.
- Back pain.
Friend Freddie give you anything else
to look after?
Got any other vehicles in the area?
- No.
So the Rover 105R, registration TLX279,
that we found at Miss Saunders' house
in Ensbury Avenue an hour ago,
is that Freddie's?
Or yours?
Your mate Baal had the key on his key ring.
And the six suitcases we found inside,
containing 78,982 quid in used banknotes,
is that Freddie's?
Or yours?
Wimborne Road, you're staying.
Above the florist.
The brown briefcase there,
with 25,060 in five and one pound notes.
Freddie's?
Yours?
And the £840 in the bedroom under the pillow.
Is that Freddie's?
And £160, three shillings and threepence
you had on you when they brought you in,
is that Freddie's too?
In total, £140,218,
one shilling and threepence ha'penny.
Freddie's a figment, Cordrey.
It's all yours.
Where'd you get it?
It's from the train robbery.
Who else was on the job?
I never said I was on the job.
Only that's where the money's from.
And that's all you get.
What's the matter with you, man,
have you got worms?
I've got a key, up my jacksie.
You've got a what up your where?
I shoved it up there
when they first brought me in.
It's for the flat in Wimborne Road.
I didn't think Bill'd give his up.
I think it's stuck.
Can you get a doctor?
Well, this'll put the wind up 'em.
Front page this morning.
What's that?
What's what?
Cordrey's Brighton.
Reynolds is South London.
That's at least two firms.
Well, that makes sense.
The witnesses on the train
said there could've been 20 blokes.
Mark up anyone associated with Cordrey,
anyone associated with Reynolds.
Then check against that new list
you've just been writing?
It's not a list, Frank.
Are you going straight in?
We've been working all night.
It's nearly nine.
Early turn starts in seven minutes.
I hope you're going to make me happy.
It's my mission in life, Tom.
Um, over here.
Um, the whole place was cleaned down.
But whoever was there left quite a bit behind.
We're working slowly.
So far, thumb marks, finger marks,
left palm prints, right palm prints.
Ian hasn't even started
on the utensils and food containers yet.
That's going to take a fair while longer.
So these prints are just one person?
No. Different.
Definitely not just one person.
All that planning
and they leave these bits behind.
Thank God they did.
At least now we've got these prints
we can start working through possible matches.
That's a long job, though.
- Yeah.
Start with these names.
Keep the list to yourself.
Make sure they're carefully logged.
We're searching for hairs, fibres
and bloodstains.
Any items giving positive presumptive tests
Will be retained.
So you'll want hair samples
from anyone we bring in.
Head and pubic.
We found hairs in sleeping bags
and a pair of underpants.
Find a match...
- We'd have them by the short and curlies.
Come in.
Oh, sorry, sir. Sirs.
More evidence from the farm?
Yellow paint found by the vehicles,
we think used to paint them.
Put it over there, Milner.
I'll look at it later.
OK. Let me know what else you can find.
Yeah, I know, love,
but I can't do anything about it.
We've got everyone breathing down our necks.
We can't clock off early, can we?
Tip-offs coming through.
These are the ones that look kosher.
Lovely. Cheers, Sid.
Really? Well, you tell him from me
that he owes Jack Slipper a big favour.
Yeah, where do you want to meet?
Time?
I'm taking the lads down the Red Lion
before home.
Morale booster for the long hours.
Do you fancy it?
- Work to do.
Something bothering you, Frank?
Why'd you bring me in on this
if you don't trust me?
Who says I don't trust you?
They told me working for you would be like this.
I didn't believe them.
An investigation lives on information.
Shared information.
Otherwise we can't do our job.
But you,
you keep everything close to your chest.
Why?
You're the best informed officer
in South London, Frank.
Because you drink in the same pubs
as these villains.
You talk to the same people.
But the wrong bit of chat, just accidental,
all our work'd be blown open.
Is that what you think of me?
I've had cases destroyed by one stray word.
Not here.
My snouts give me tip-offs.
Never the other way round.
I am bringing you first-class information.
And you are giving me nothing.
Not your top names,
not what evidence is coming in.
You won't even come for a bloody drink.
You are leading a squad, Tom.
A squad works best together.
Lads'll be waiting for you, Frank.
Right, come on, he's not coming.
Out the way, lad.
All right, love, it's here.
That'll do.
Watch it. Watch it. There you go.
All right, here we go.
Good one, lad.
He frightens the flipping' life out of me.
Every time I see him looking, I think,
what's he going to shout at me now for?
Walked right into that working hours one.
Don't he have a home to go to?
They reckon the Yard is his home.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
You all right, sir?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cheers, lads.
Drop me off here, Jock.
I'll walk the rest of the way.
Wouldn't want the engine to wake her.
Good night.
- Good night, sir.
Leave your details with the constable.
Thank you.
So...
Mr Ahern was giving Mrs Hargreaves
her regular lift to work
when his motorbike engine out out.
So they decided to go for a walk in the woods
while it cooled down.
Which is where they spotted...this.
£100‚900‚ sir.
Roughly the same amount as Cordrey had.
A little bit less.
So that's how they're dividing it, then.
Hundred grand each.
But whose was it?
What was it doing in those woods?
Maurice and his men lifted 13 prints.
They're with the fingerprint department.
But we found something even better.
A receipt from a restaurant in Hindelang,
West Germany.
It's dated February this year.
The receipt is made out to Herr and Frau Field.
Brian Field, employee of
your friendly solicitor John Wheater.
Good.
Mr Field, you arranged
the purchase of Leatherslade Farm.
If I'd known it was going to turn out
to be such a rum do,
I wouldn't have done the conveyancing.
Of course you wouldn't, sir.
Do you mind me asking where you were
on Friday 9th of August?
The day after the robbery.
I was at the office.
Usual working hours, normal day.
Then I went home and went to bed.
Any visitors that night?
No, no. Just me and the wife.
Very quiet.
And the weekend?
We went to a neighbour's
christening party on the Sunday.
Very nice.
Well, thank you very much, sir.
Just had to clear that up.
May I...?
- Yes, of course, yeah.
Cheerio.
He's lying about having had no visitors.
Derby Police received a call
from one of Brian Field's neighbours.
They rang because
they'd noticed a large number of vehicles
going in and out of Field's driveway
on the night of the 9th August.
The trouble is, the witness wouldn't make a
written statement. Didn't want to make it official.
What else do we have on him?
Maurice Ray confirmed Brian Field's prints
were on the receipt from Germany,
on a holdall with the notes in.
But we can't prove the notes in the holdall
were from the robbery
because the banks
didn't keep records of most of them.
That stays within these walls.
I don't want anyone getting wind of that.
Field goes on the list of suspects.
Who have we eliminated?
We've eliminated...
Pitts, Kehoe, Sansom, Robinson,
Cramer, Hayden Smith,
Ambrose and Shakeshaft.
Leaving us with Lilley.
Smith. Daly.
Wilson. White.
Pembroke. Goody. James.
Welch. And Reynolds.
Connections between them?
Field represented Goody.
Goody is a known associate
of Wilson and Reynolds.
Reynolds is Daly's brother-in-law,
suspected of the airport robbery last year.
Dames was the suspected driver on that.
Welch is connected to Cordrey,
who's already confessed.
Lilley is Welch's alibi and vice versa.
Smith's worked with Wilson
on a number of occasions.
Sir.
Can you not see we're working here, Slipper?
Very sorry, sir. You're wanted upstairs.
DCS Millen,
and he's got Commander Hatherill with him.
What solid evidence have we got
connecting this lot with the robbery or the farm?
None at all.
Not until the full forensics
and fingerprints come back.
Well, get some, Will you?
Do your jobs. The clock is ticking.
Frank, come with me.
Is my tie straight?
- Yeah, it's fine.
Don't speak unless I tell you
and don't say anything that contradicts me.
Are you sure you want me in there?
Course I want you in there.
You're my best officer.
Come in.
George and I have agreed,
we're going to publish photographs
of all the wanted men, and their wives,
via posters, newspaper releases and
television news bulletins as of this evening.
No, you can't do that.
We need to demonstrate
we're fully aware who's behind it...
You'll demonstrate that by nicking them.
- And the public are our best allies on this.
The public Will only get in the way.
Where are your main suspects right now, Tom?
We don't have exact locations on all of them.
How many do you have exact locations on?
Two.
By turning this into a public manhunt
you'll be destroying any chance you have of...
Are you just going to sit there
and say nothing, Frank?
Well, I thought you, um...
DCS Butler's is right.
You name these people, they'll know
we're onto them, send them underground
and that'll make them harder to find, not easier.
Don't agree.
They'll have nowhere to hide.
They've got money spilling out of their pockets.
They won't be short of friends.
Right now, we have the upper hand
because they don't know what evidence
we have or who we suspect.
The moment they get an inkling of that,
we lose power.
Secrecy is our best weapon.
Do not tell them what we know.
The public are starting to think these men
are like modern day Robin Hoods.
The press think we don't know
what we're doing. We can't go on like this.
I'm not running this
for public opinion or the press.
Maybe not, but both of them
are making the Home Secretary anxious.
And he's passing his anxieties down the line.
Why put their mug shots all over the country?
What does it achieve?
When has that ever worked before?
We're in uncharted territory, Tom.
This is the biggest crime
this country's ever seen.
Is the... Is the DPP in favour?
They've voiced their concerns.
If you put these men's faces on a wanted
poster without all the evidence in place,
you are jeopardising the chances of a fair trial.
Frank's right.
We're prepared to take that risk.
I want it put on record I am protesting
this decision in the strongest possible terms.
Noted. That'll be all, Tom.
Frank.
Are you all right?
- I want some air.
You fancy having my job one day, Frank?
Never thought about it.
Bollocks you haven't.
Remember this.
Doesn't matter who you are or how high you go,
there's always a wanker boss.
Cheers.
Today
po/ice investigating the mail train robbery
rook the unprecedented step
of publishing the photographs
of the wanted men and their wives.
A large reward is being offered for information
as to the whereabouts of the gang.
In particular, Bruce Reynolds,
who is suspected of masterminding the robbery
in which over two million pounds was stolen.
Dear Mr Butler, I swear I saw one of
them robbers yesterday in my local shop.
He was buying sausages.
I knew he was not from round here
cos he was wearing smart shoes.
Yours sincerely, Gladis Williams."
Thanks a bundle, Frank.
What have I done?
Ever since those wanted posters went out,
phones ring off the hook,
mail's delivered in sacks and it's all bollocks.
Not all of it, is it?
- 99 out of 100.
I've had Bruce Reynolds spotted
travelling on a coach across Switzerland
in Swiss national costume,
grey beard and a feathered hat.
Roy James has been seen on practically
every racing track in the world.
Jimmy White, his wife and their poodle
were seen climbing in the Austrian Alps.
And Buster Edwards is apparently operating
as a mercenary soldier in the Belgian Congo.
Which idiot had the idea
to release those photos?
Hester.
Millen.
I should have a word.
The Great British Public
only ever add to the confusion.
How's the old Grey Fox coping?
Dear Flying Squad,
I know nothing about the train robbery but I
do suggest that you question Princess Margaret.
I've seen her in the pub
and she hangs around with a right rum lot."
Tom. I heard what Millen
and Hatherill did to you.
Just tell me, when did they last
solve a case this way?
Move into an office on that floor
and it's all politics.
I pray I never do.
I pray you don't too, Tom.
I can't do it, Maurice.
Not if they keep hobbling me like this.
I thought you might need a piece of good news.
Partial prints from the cellophane wrapper of
a Johnson's travelling kit, and a drum of salt.
Both found at the farm.
The previous occupants say they cleared it out
when they left.
So they must be from the train gang.
Add in a palm print from a windowsill.
And a match with our records.
Give me the name, Maurice.
I'm home.
Where's my little angels?
Charles Frederick Wilson?
Yeah, that's right.
Detective Chief Superintendent Butler
of the Flying Squad.
This is Detective Inspector Williams.
Like to talk to you in connection
with the mail train robbery at Cheddington.
You might have heard of it.
I read about it but I've never been there.
Well, my boys'll search your house,
while you come with us.
You ain't got nothing strong enough
to take me in.
Car's outside.
Listen, ring him, won't you?
Daddy, where are you going?
Don't you worry. Be right back.
All right, mates?
D'you know Cheddington
in Buckinghamshire?
I've never been there in my life.
Leatherslade Farm at Brill.
Well, I read about it in the papers.
Look, I ain't been there.
And no-one can say I have.
Where were you on the morning of
the 8th August?
I was at Spitalfields Market.
Left home at five and went to work.
Got any receipts for that day?
Proof of business done?
It's a market, we don't give receipts.
But I saw a couple of fellas.
They'll vouch for me.
I've reason to believe
they wouldn't be telling the truth.
And what reason would that be?
That's for me to know, son.
Tell him, Frank.
Charles Frederick Wilson, you Will be detained
and taken to Aylesbury Police Station
where you'll be charged
in being concerned with others
in robbing a Travelling Post Office train
at Cheddington on the 8th of August 1963.
Dinnertime.
- Whey.
Got any corned beef?
- In your dreams.
Oh, look, it's like feeding time at the zoo.
Oi. That's mine.
- Oh, you've got to be quicker than that.
Rugby training, you see.
Fast on your feet. You should try it.
You are talking to the 1944 light heavyweight
champion, Combined Forces Rhodesia.
Now give me back my sandwich or you Will get
a little right cross on that lovely jaw.
Oh, yeah? Let's see how it's done, eh?
You're the one that needs to be quicker, old son.
Overtime cards, please, lads.
No cards, no pay.
Thank you very much.
Thank you kindly.
Oh, cheese and pickle, my favourite.
Oi, oi, eh.
Mr Moore.
What's that?
- Overtime cards for the squad.
They're working all the hours.
- I should hope so.
Oh, yeah?
What are they going to do, walk out of the cells?
I think it unlikely it's Buster Edwards, madam.
Thank you for your help.
Buster Edwards.
Somebody saw the photo we released.
Phoned in, got an address.
Right, lads, come on, quick.
Come on, lads.
Oi, you two. Having a day off?
Go on, get going.
Come on, lads.
Old Forge Crescent, Shepperton.
Neighbour rang in to say two people the spit
of Edwards and his wife moved in next door.
Mr and Mrs Green.
Can't this heap go any faster, Jock?
Dave, doors, neighbours.
Mr Green? Mrs Green?
Open the door, please. it's the police.
Go on.
Police.
Mr Green.
Anyone here?
No-one here. House is empty.
Neighbours say they left about an hour ago.
Red Morris 1100.
We'll try and find the plate number.
They didn't even have time
to drink their tea.
We'll get fingerprints on it straight away.
And we've sent out an alert on the car.
Well, that's all we can do for now.
All right?
We do not rest.
They are not better than us.
Afternoon.
I'll have a nice bunch of roses, please,
sweetheart.
Ooh.
Thank you very much, my darling.
Have a lovely day.
What were you doing in Leicester, Goody?
- A little day out.
I've been staying at the Windmill Pub in
Blackfriars since you lot turned my old lady over.
That lot in the paper, they're mates of mine,
so I thought I'd keep out of the way.
Seen any of them lately?
No, Mr Butler, I haven't.
Not around 3am on the 8th August?
No.
Where were you then?
Over the water.
Emerald Isles.
Ireland?
Who with?
- I'd rather not say.
What were you doing?
- Bit of fishing, bit of shooting.
Where did you stay?
- Never mind all that.
How'd you know I was at that hotel, anyway?
The hotel florist
thought you were Bruce Reynolds.
She saw his picture in the paper.
Mistaken for your mate.
Unlucky, Goody.
Bloody glasses.
Could've been worse. She Could've thought
I looked like Charlie.
Whose name did you cross out in
your address book when we arrested you?
Name of a lady. I didn't want her
involved in any misunderstanding.
Margaret Perkins.
Mr Williams, please, we're both gentlemen.
Not one of your mates on the job, then.
I didn't do any job.
I was drinking Guinness from the source.
Why did you note the numbers of all the five
pound and 10 shilling notes we found on you?
Just a precaution.
Mistakes get made.
You ever been to Leatherslade Farm at Brill?
Mr Butler, what would I be doing on a farm?
Preparing to commit a robbery.
Mr Butler, please.
You weren't there the morning of
the 8th of August?
Ireland, Mr Butler.
Not Bucks. Ireland.
You ever been? You should go.
It's lovely.
You travelled to Belfast, by air,
on August the 2nd.
With your little old mum
and a man named Knowles.
That's right.
You stayed with a relative.
You returned to England alone
on Tuesday August the 6th.
Knowles and your mum travelled back together
on Wednesday 7th.
So you weren't in Ireland
the night of the train robbery.
Now would you like a second go
at any of my previous questions?
I think you can deal with my mouthpiece
from now on if you don't mind.
Released on an undertaking to return
on the 7th of September.
Without any matches on prints or forensics,
we can't keep him.
You were shot in the face in the war,
weren't you?
Yeah.
Commando?
- I was.
Italy.
Did you enjoy it?
Yeah, when I wasn't being shot in the face.
You weren't in the forces yourself?
No, I was kept on the squad. I was lucky.
You have lots of cases?
Larceny. Receiving.
Warehouse-breaking.
There was a type of man
who saw the war as an opportunity.
A golden period,
where normal rules didn't apply.
While others were fighting for country and
going without, this man thought he'd profit.
I went after those men.
I got plenty of them.
This lot, the train robbers, they're the same.
Skimming off the top, easy targets,
while other people work hard for a living.
Cowards with coshes.
Talk to your people, Frank.
My people?
You know who I mean.
- Mm-hm.
I'm not pissing about any longer.
I'll have every last one of this gang
if it kills me.
Tommy Butler's got the bit between his teeth
about the train robbery.
Business is going to get very bad
for every single man in this room.
Butler'll have me turning over every villain
in South London
till someone gives that gang up.
Do we understand each other?
Afternoon, James. Been a while.
Going my way?
- You all right?
How's work?
Fine.
Yours?
Every day's a thrill, Tom.
You must have something on Goody.
We know where he is. We've had him in.
He must’ve left some trace at the farm.
These are his from when he was holed up
in London at the Windmill Pub.
Size 10 brown suede Trueform.
He was involved, I'm sure of it.
So am I.
I gave evidence against him
at the airport robbery trial.
He got off.
As he walked out past the prosecution,
he pulled apart a piece of evidence
to show something I'd missed.
Goody lied on oath,
and bragged about it to humiliate me.
He's not getting away with this one.
We must connect him to Leatherslade Farm.
Are these yours?
They look like mine. Can I have a closer look?
You ever loan them to anyone?
They're shoes, Mr Butler.
Of course not.
When you were being held at Aylesbury
on August the 24th,
Constable Price talked to you,
and offered you something to eat.
You said to him, "If you had my worries,
you wouldn't want to eat."
What did you mean by that?
I was worried, worried about being fitted up.
PC Price then said to you,
"if you unfold your worries to me,
would you feel better?"
To which you replied "No, brother.
You'd probably be out digging for the money.
Did Charlie tell you where his money was?"
Charlie Wilson, you meant.
Buried your out of the cash, did you?
Same place as Wilson's?
I came back here, complying with your bail,
and now you're putting this on me.
Goody.
We both know you were there.
We've got the proof.
I'd like to speak to my solicitor alone now
if you don't mind, Mr Butler.
I know nothing of this matter
and I'm completely innocent.
Edwards, James, Reynolds.
Where are they? Who's hiding them?
Especially Reynolds.
Everything points to him leading this job.
Tell your snouts, we'll make it worth their while.
I want them here. Now get on it.
Go on, Frank.
Guv'nor.
What?
- The lads...
We were just, they were just...
You know, some of them are dead on their feet,
exhausted.
You've been working us, them,
evenings and weekends
and then there's the wives and young kids.
They never seen 'em.
So maybe we could work something
where everyone has one day off a week,
you know, like a rota or something like...
And then we... I hadn't finished.
Getting a bit much is it?
What do you want, a bit of time off on me?
All expenses paid?
A week in the Costa del Sol?
Dinner out, drinks on the house, tans on tap?
While you're feeling sorry for yourselves,
that lot are spending the money they nicked.
They're living better than you.
And you want time off?
Bloody hell, Frank.
We said, ask him on the quiet.
What d'you tell your mum about us?
- Nothing.
Don't she ask?
No.
Your life...
All in separate compartments.
Isn't everyone's?
No.
Morning, lads.
Ready for the fight?
He's in a good mood.
Second Thursday.
What's so special about second Thursday?
Every second Wednesday,
he sees his fancy woman.
Butler's bunk-up night.
Morning, Sid.
- Morning, sir.
Morning, Frank.
- Morning, guv'nor.
What are we missing?
I met him once, Reynolds.
Is that a fact?
Been keeping this little gem to yourself,
have you, Frank?
When did you meet him?
- Just after the airport job.
We were keeping an eye, you know.
Funny thing is,
he said, "Send my regards to Mr Butler."
He said what?
Well, I told him
you wouldn't have a clue who he was.
He just smiled.
Where is he, Frank?
Afternoon, sir.
That your flat up the top?
- Yes, it is.
How do I access it?
Through the back and up the stairs.
Afternoon, madam.
Is there a problem, Officer?
We were patrolling the area and we noticed
a ladder up against the wall of your flat.
A ladder?
There may have been an attempted break-in.
What, here?
- Are you alone in the flat?
Er, well...
D'you mind if we take a look around?
All right, then...Officer. Come on in.
All right, lads?
- Crikey, Charlie.
Could you put some clothes on, sir?
You caught us by surprise.
- Apparently.
Oh, my Lord.
It's all right, sweetheart,
we might as well tell the truth.
Might we?
- Yeah.
Me and this good lady, we...
we shouldn't be doing this.
Her husbands due home in a couple of hours.
I see.
We heard the door and we thought it was him.
She just panicked. Didn't you?
It looks like your...the lady's flat may have been
the subject of an attempted burglary.
You what?
Ladder up the outside.
Must’ve happened while you were...
deep in conversation.
Cheeky bleeders, eh?
Well, they didn't take anything?
Not even your clothes, sir?
Well, thank you, Officer.
Appreciate your vigilance. But...
As you can see, we're fine.
Why don't you show the gentlemen out?
Bruce Reynolds is the most wanted man
in the country and you didn't recognise him?
He said he was her lover.
He said what?
- He was her lover.
He wasn't her lover. He was her husband.
He was a train robber.
We didn't know.
- You don't know anything.
I'd be surprised if you could find your own arse.
Get out of it.
Reynolds' prints are all round the place.
Also, Roy James...fingerprints on a dirty mug.
Must’ve been visiting.
Not long ago.
Potato sacks.
Someone's left two potato sacks
in a phone box.
And then called it in.
Which phone box?
- Does it matter?
Only asking.
Corner of Great Dover Street
and Blackhorse Court. SE1.
South of the river, see?
And there was no-one around?
- Not by the time we got there.
Well, open it up, then, Tom.
Let the dog see the rabbit.
Oh, that stinks.
Well?
Well, this must’ve been buried.
Buried in what?
How much d'you think's there?
Tip-off said over 40 grand.
40 grand.
Even so, do we have to tip it on the floor?
We'll be fumigating for months.
Sid, this cash stays in this office.
You're sleeping here tonight,
till it goes to Aylesbury first thing.
You want me to sleep with that?
You've slept with worse.
Can someone answer that bloody phone?
Here you are, Sid.
- Right, never mind this sideshow.
Get this cleared up,
and concentrate on the villains.
Sir. Roy James. We've found him.
Word has come in from a female informant.
Roy James is staying in a house
in St John's Wood.
Now, this is the plan
showing all the entrances and exits.
We've already got observation front and back.
We go there now, recce the place,
make our move tonight.
We play this right, sir, we can have him.
Come on, Frank, we'll take my car.
- Oh, really?
What's wrong with my car?
- It's not the car I'm worried about.
Watch that.
We have men on the corner at Abbey Road
and round the back on Carlton Vale.
No-one's coming in or out.
He's doing a bunk.
- Go, boys.
Right, stay close.
He's going up the stairs.
He's heading for the roof.
- Get in there.
Stop, police.
Stay where you are.
He's on the roof.
Stop there.
Hey, stop.
Down here.
Evening.
That's nothing to do with me.
In my experience, innocent men don't run.
What should I have done?
Open the door and get nicked?
When you were searched, we found £131.
You normally carry that amount of cash?
Sometimes.
Two of the £5 notes in your possession
were serial numbers
J695007 and J94284281.
So?
Those notes were reported stolen
by the National Commercial Bank of Scotland
during the train robbery.
Last night, they were in your pocket.
In your holdall, we found £12,041.
Damp notes.
Like they'd been buried.
In the allotment, was it?
Where you jumped?
Very clever, your escape route, digging in the
garden for a soft landing in case you needed it.
Dunno what you mean.
Also in the holdall we found this piece of paper,
with various figures on it.
There's a list of bank note denominations,
alongside a column of amounts.
That's not my writing.
Beneath the column of amounts,
there's a list of expenditure.
You might want to note just here.
There's £1,500 next to the word "Brab".
How's your new car, Mr James?
Brabham, isn't it?
Congratulations, by the way.
Your win at Cadwell Park. Very impressive.
The sum total of the amounts column
comes to 2109,500.
Strangely close to the share
some of the train robbers got.
What d'you call it, a whack?
Is that the slang?
Where's Bruce Reynolds?
Who?
Today sees the beginning of one of the most
remarkable trials in British legal history.
The men in court are accused of robbing a mail train of more than two and a half million pounds
in August of last year.
Aylesbury District Council Chamber has been converted into a make shìft courtroom
to accommodate the vast number of lawyers,
public and press in attendance.
If convicted of the robbery, the accused
are expected to receive severe sentences.
All rise.
After a trial lasting 43 days,
the jury has taken 63 hours of deliberation
to reach a verdict.
Will the defendants please stand?
On the charge of conspiring
to rob Her Majesty's Mail,
how do you find
the defendant Douglas Gordon Goody?
Guilty.
On the charge of conspiring
to rob Her Majesty's Mail,
how do you find
the defendant Roy John James?
Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Well done, Tom.
When grave crime is committed
it calls for grave punishment,
not for the purpose of mere retribution
but so that others similarly tempted
shall be brought to the sharp realisation
that crime does not pay
and that the crime is certainly not worth
even the most alluring candle.
As the higher the price,
the greater the temptation.
Potential criminals who may be dazzled
by the enormity of the prize
must be taught that the punishment they risk
will be proportionately greater.
I therefore find myself faced with the unenviable
duty of pronouncing grave sentences.
Charles Frederick Wilson,
Roy John James,
Ronald Arthur Biggs,
Douglas Gordon Goody,
you Will go to prison for concurrent terms
of 25 years on the first count
and 30 years on the second.
You get less for murder.
Roger John Cordrey,
in respect of the four counts,
you must go to prison
for concurrent terms of 20 years.
Brian Arthur Field,
the concurrent sentences of the court
are that on the first count
you Will go to prison for 25 years
and on the 12th count
you Will go to prison for five years.
The long sentences of 30 years
handed out to the great train robbers
has caused a public outcry.
Questions have also been asked in Parliament
regarding the severity of the judgement.
All those found guilty are to appeal.
Gentlemen, a toast.
The train squad.
The snitches.
The snitches.
30 years.
A bit steep, don't you think?
Shouldn't have done the job in the first place,
should they?
That's it, then, lads. Time to go.
Frank, that's got to go to C11.
- OK, you take that up for me.
Hello?
I've got him, sir. Buster Edwards.
He's surrendered, given a written statement.
I'll be in.
This is DCS Butler.
Where were you on the 7th and 8th of August
1963, Wednesday night, Thursday morning?
No idea.
A lot of time's passed.
I'd say I was definitely indoors.
Indoors?
Definitely.
Where were you on the 6th of August 1963,
Tuesday?
I would have been indoors then too.
Unless there was boxing on.
I might go and see the fights
if there was boxing.
Do you know Leatherslade Farm?
Yes.
I was going to clean it up
but I got scared, sol didn't.
I wasn't at the train. I've said so
in my written statement. You've got it there.
Know the persons associated with the robbery
whose photographs have appeared
in the press and on TV?
Some of them.
I don't want to name them. It does no good.
Do you know Bruce Reynolds?
I don't want to answer that.
Why now?
What?
Why give up now?
A dozen and one reasons.
They didn't matter on their own but put together,
they do.
My little girl, Nicolette.
I want her brought up in England.
She speaks better Spanish than English.
My wife misses her mum and dad.
Wants them to see their grand-daughter.
She's been on at me.
It ain't a normal life, on the run.
People are just after your money.
And now the money's run out.
I won't get 30 years like the others.
Not if you only cleaned up
like you said in your statement.
That right, sir?
Where's Bruce Reynolds?
No idea.
30 years' service, MBE.
A fine career, Tom. Congratulations.
Here's to a Well-earned retirement.
- I don't want it.
I beg your pardon?
- I want to stay on.
I want your dispensation to keep going.
You've got a pension coming.
- The job's not done.
What job?
The train robbery. Reynolds.
I've got Frank Williams all lined up to take over.
He's waited long enough as it is.
Not until I get Reynolds. I want to see it through.
Please. Sir.
Frank“ understand.
We're going to miss you, Tom.
You're going to have to be
patient a while longer.
What d'you mean? You're retiring.
You've done your time.
Like I told you, Frank,
there's always a wanker boss.
Jock.
I've just had a very interesting
telephone conversation.
I fancy a drive.
- Sir.
All ready, sir.
Hello, son.
Is your daddy in?
He's in bed.
- Is he?
Bruce.
- Stay there.
Hello, Reynolds.
You took long enough.
Your dad's done a few things he shouldn't.
I'm going to have to go away for a while now.
You look after your mum. Do as she says.
You be a good boy.
You're the man of the house now.
You remember...
Your dad loves you.
He always Will.
Come here.
Be lucky, son.
Time to go.
You know who to call.
How'd you find me?
Someone grassed?
I heard you refused retirement.
I'm flattered.
I've been thinking of giving myself up
for a while.
All that stuff in the newspapers
about me being the mastermind...
I wouldn't pay too much attention to that.
Worried you'll get the same as the rest?
30 years.
It's a disgrace.
There's rapists and murderers
doing less than half of that.
30 years for nicking a bit of cash.
- Don't break the law, don't get the sentence.
No guns, no violence.
- Apart from the driver.
He got up and drove the train.
He can't have been that bad.
Jack Mills got shingles from the shock.
His right hand shakes constantly.
He can't sleep, he's off sick.
He's a broken man.
How could we know that'd happen?
He went to work that night, that's all.
You and your mates ruined his life.
You've been doing this long enough.
Every crime has a victim, somewhere.
You haven't ever given them a thought.
You know what sending everyone down
for 30 years does?
It means every little crook takes weapons now.
Guns on every job.
Cos if you're going to get 30 years
without a gun, you might as well take one.
It can't be any worse.
The moment that judge did that,
everything changed.
Whole attitude.
The moment he passed that sentence,
he brought guns into every job.
It's always someone else's fault.
Why'd you come back?
Money run out for you too?
You know what amazes me?
You had no plan.
From the second you took the cash,
no plan at all.
Just run and spend and hope.
You're not stupid.
But you're no mastermind.
You got lucky. Very lucky.
But none of you were bright enough
to ride your luck.
And the paint? On Gordon's shoes?
He's certain it was never there.
He was done up.
Convicted on false evidence.
Bill Baal was never in the gang.
You got that wrong.
You convicted an innocent man.
So a convicted liar
is challenging me on the truth?
You know what's funny, Mr Butler?
You think you set the rules.
But you've been chasing me for so long.
Your life has been following what I do.
Not any more.
Why'd you do it?
A job that big.
Never going to get away with it.
You must’ve known that.
You've got to dream big, Mr Butler.
What are we here for, eh,
if we don't make our mark?
It was never just about the cash.
It's the buzz.
Building the team, finding the job,
planning the job, carrying it out.
It's the camaraderie.
Trusting other men with everything you know.
With your life.
You above all people should know
what that feels like.
Night, sir.
- Good night.
