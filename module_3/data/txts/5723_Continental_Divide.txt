Hell of a column today!
Today you've gone too
far. What do you mean?
Stuff that good could get
an innocent person killed.
Ah, I'm not that innocent.
Don't let the dimple fool you.
Me! An innocent
person like me!
Hey. Hey. i
an I get you a chair?
Mr. Souchak, would you
be offended if, uh,
I asked you to buy your papers
at O'Leary's for a while?
I'll pay for 'em.
Hiya, Souchak.
Great piece, baby.
It's about time you said
that about me, Agatha.
See ya.
This is the agenda for the Buildings
committee meeting on Friday.
Yablonowitz has his f
ngers in items two and four.
Please. What for?
Ah, it's crazy,
Mr. Hellinger.
Every day I get hot stories,
the paper gets circulation,
chicago gets wiser,
you keep getting older.
It's not only crazy,
it's un-American.
Satisfaction.
I get that.
Yeah, well, you're a
good man, Mr. Hellinger.
ust don't run
for president.
Hey. i Okay, spider-Man.
come up here with me, Dad. Down.
You'd never get me up on one of those.
I get vertigo just standing on my toes.
Really? i, ve been that
way since I was his age.
Hey.
Why don't you get on my shoulders?
Then you can get up there.
Really?
Nah.
I haven't got
the height.
Home, James.
30.
I'll be there.
sixteen refers to clause 9B of
the trucking deregulations bill?
That is correct, Alderman.
9B and, in view of which,
gentlemen, the contract renewal,
which is under this subcommittee, s
consideration is, at this time,
for the leasing
of specialized equipment,
therefore not subject
to competitive bidding.
Uh, I accordingly should like to
recommend approval of contract 44-KG,
city of hicago
ordinance P-17,
to Metro Machine Tools,
Incorporated.
Now, as to the matter of the queries
raised by the Sherman committee,
item number one had to do
with their tax-exemption claim.
And item two,
the political principle...
that a ity Hall
connection exists...
with Metro, s
attorneys-at-law.
so...
after due consideration,
we feel satisfied that all
three queries are inapplicable.
i, therefore, would like to accordingly call
for a vote on renewal of the Metro contract.
All in favor?
Unanimous. My granddaughter gave me
a pocket calculator for christmas.
I still don't get
a chance to use it.
Yeah? Right.
Metro.
sun-Times. i Souchak does
it again! sun-Times. i
Shit.
He's done it again.
The son of a bitch
has done it again!
Every goddamn day,
five editions a day. i
Me, my wife, and now the
Metro deal! Metro deal?
Shit.
Don't you see it?
Look.
Right here.
Yeah, there it is!
Right here.
"Today's dirt. Dirt of the day." esus!
Okay, enough.
Listen, fellas.
I'd appreciate it if you'd f nd
out who's dishing it to 'im, okay?
You got it.
Say, you got a match, mister? Sure.
Hell, have the whole book.
Move, man!
Hey, man.
I've seen this one before.
You're what's-his-name.
That's right.
No shit. He is.
You're okay, man.
Yeah, man. You wrote some good
shit about our neighborhood.
Drexel Park.
Right.
I'm sorry about this, but
give me your wallet. Right.
You guys the Rasta Devils? Right again.
Now give me that watch.
What happened to Gilmore? Heard
he got bounced from the Heathens.
He was dipping in the
treasury. Norton had to cut him.
He just cut him.
Oh.
That means everything north
of 55th Street is up for grabs.
What about
the block association?
This is interesting. What's
your name? I'm Franklyn.
That's with a "Y."
Franklyn curt. Man, you crazy?
Hey, man! What you tryin' to pull, man?
Oh, shit. The man. i
Let, s get out. i
Man, I didn't even open it. Why
don't you stall 'em? Five minutes.
How am I gonna know when
it's f ve minutes? My watch!
That, s all right. They didn, t take
anything. Aren't you Ernie Souchak?
That's right. I thought I recognized you.
Great piece today. That's what
Alderman Yablonowitz said to tell you.
Great piece.
You lost your badge.
Right.
Huh?
Giving me one lousy cigarette doesn't
give you the right to kick me out of town.
Are you crazy? Nobody's
trying to kick you anywhere.
All I'm suggesting-
Mmm.
All I'm suggesting is that you go and do a
story in New Orleans for a couple of weeks.
They got this hot consortium of
developers there. They're all ex-chicago.
You pick up Yablonowitz
the minute you come back.
Howard?
You need a lobotomy.
Down the corridor, third door on
the left. They got diplomas in it.
I just want us to lay back
for a while till things cool.
Especially till after we
run your story on his mother.
I don't want you
in here permanently.
I like it here. The
nurses give me bed baths.
How 'bout if I order you
to New Orleans?
How 'bout you go screw yourself?
How 'bout dinner Sunday night?
How about
the Nell Porter story?
It's better than
the New Orleans one.
You're on shift work,
you two.
He bugs me weekdays,
you Sundays.
Souchak, just because it's out of chicago
- Nothing personal, Sylvia.
You know I love you, respect you
and long to tear your clothes off.
- Ahem.
- Dump this mick and let me take you away from all this.
Where to, if you won't
leave chicago?
Another part of chicago.
Oh, come on.
Grow up, Sylvia.
What the hell do I know about
the intercontinental crack?
continental Divide.
That too.
Fresh air makes me nauseous. I bet
they got hills up where she comes from.
Sort of.
We call them the Rockies.
The Rocky Mountains?
Mm-hmm.
So you've heard of them.
Good night. Thank you
for two-thirds of dinner.
Souchak, it's a scoop.
She's never been interviewed.
Four years she's been up
there, completely alone.
Apart from her eagles. She's
a highly respected scientist.
She's an eagle freak.
She is a holy woman.
Ohh! Why didn't you
say that?
That makes all the
difference. A holy woman.
Is there any more
cauliflower?
It'd be something new
to write about.
I like writing the old thing
over and over. A new angle.
Really? Some big eagle up there
wheeler-dealing little eagles?
Fixing eagle elections?
A crooked eagle in Nebraska?
souchak, the Rockies run
through eight different states.
Nebraska isn't one of them.
Try Wyoming.
souchak, for my sake
as managing editor,
if you wanna f nish off
Yablonowitz, you gotta stay healthy.
Go to Wyoming.
Howard,
you talked me into it.
The answer's no.
sylvia.
Don't make eyes.
Making eyes at a Souchak
never worked.
I'm a Souchak,
so it just won't work.
Howard?
- Uh-huh?
How do people get up the Rockies? How?
They havejeeps,
things like that?
eeps, helicopters.
They got everything.
so you think we did the right
thing? Oh, for God, s sake.
You think he, II be okay? sylvia, he, s
a grown man. What can happen to him?
That, s what I keep
asking myself.
Listen, I know souchak. He, II
be having the time ofhis life.
Look, you go on.
Leave me here to die.
I always wanted to die
in the mountains.
You get the view and everything. Mountains?
These here is bumps
in the ground.
What are you doing?
checking for rattlesnakes.
What for?
Pardon?
Plenty other things up
there to worry about.
Well, good.
I'll worry about them then.
What is it?
Possum.
Am I pleased
or frightened?
Take a look.
What the hell is that?
i just told you- Possum.
esus hrist. i
You got lots of possums
around here? ust that one.
Been spotted a few times.
is he friendly?
You one of them
reporter fellas?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
She likes reporter fellas
least of all.
She don't like
no one much.
She almost killed one.
One what?
Reporter fella?
Fella messin' around
with her eagles.
What do you mean,
"almost killed"?
You know, when you stop breathin'
and walkin' and seein' things?
That kind of "almost
killed him." Uh-huh.
Okay.
Oh, shit!
Geez!
Phew.
Getting more fun
every day.
The air's thinner
up here.
Better lay off those
today.
Every day
for 13 years,
some smart-ass has been
trying to tell me to qui-
Dear Lord, I know this might
sound a touch hypocritical...
after the way I've been...
roughly since birth,
but if you could swing things
just this once...
so I can get out ofhere...
uneaten,
I promise
I'll never again...
ask for anything...
or complain about anything.
ust please don't let
these hairy mother-
Goddamn it. i Get out ofhere. i Go on. i
Get out ofhere. i
You goddamn wet-nosed
son of a bitch!
Get out of here!
Go on! Beat it!
That was one of the other things
you had to worry about.
Really?
Thank you, Lord. I won't
forget that or my promise.
Oh, no.
Oh, no!
The bear stole
all my cigarettes!
For that I could've stayed
in chicago!
Oh, no!
It ain't much,
but there it is.
Ugh.
She's gone to the movies,
I guess.
Where are you going? You hired
me to bring you to Nell Porter's.
This here's Nell Porter's.
See ya.
Well, when do you think
she'll be back? Who knows?
Wait! You come back for me in two weeks!
When did we say?
Two weeks!
Well, if that, s what we said
- That's what we said!
said. i
Hello?
Hello.
Hello.
Shit.
Whoa! Ooh!
shit.
You're in my house.
I, uh-
You broke in.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to assume
the best for now.
You're a novice hiker
way out of your depth.
cold? Scared?
Lost?
You waited outside as long
as you could stand it?
You forgot tired.
Go to sleep.
You look awful.
Thank you.
Great coffee.
Perfect.
Thanks.
Ernie Souchak.
Nell Porter.
Nice to meet you,
Miss Porter.
Did I say "perfect"?
I was underselling you.
I've got my own provisions. Yes, I noticed.
Freeze-dried eggs.
Enjoy the real thing.
It'll be the last you get till
you get where you're going.
I saw from the tracks outside
that there were two of you.
Did Deke Lewis help you?
Well, 50-50.
Helped me, helped himself
to my liquor.
All of it.
Yeah, I know Deke.
He's a good guy,
but a lousy timekeeper.
Pardon?
Here's one.
Last October he told me he'd
deliver some supplies in November.
He showed up in May.
Where are you from, Mr. Souchak? chicago.
You?
I was raised in Boston.
That's one place I've never been. No?
I don't get out of chicago
much, try as I will.
Too bad. It's a magnif cent country.
That's so true.
Where are you headed?
Pardon?
Pardon?
Where am I headed?
That's right.
Uh, now?
Yes.
Here.
Salt?
I don't understand
what you're talking about.
I'm a newspaperman. This is the
story I've always prayed I'd do.
Finally my editor gave in.
i guess I wore him down.
What story?
Story about what?
You.
Did you ever think to ask
if I wanted that?
Did it never occur to you
to ask permission?
Of all the unmitigated,
presumptuous gall!
There's no call
to use big words.
Okay, here's a short one. "Out." How?
I can't get back
on my own.
ust aim straight downhill.
Deke Lewis will be back
in two weeks. No, now!
Miss Porter,
I'll die out there.
Life is full
of little trade-offs.
i mean it. I mean it. i
I washed the dishes.
I washed the dishes,
and you're chopping wood.
I gotta get out of here.
Well, you talked me into it.
I don't suppose you have
any cigarettes, do you?
There's nothing personal in this.
I'm sure you're a f ne newspaperman.
But I do serious work here,
in private and in peace.
I'm not a pop singer. I don't
have a million records to sell.
Publicity
is trite and trivial.
Reporters are parasites.
They feed off the
accomplishments of other people.
I don't see newspapers much,
but what I do see sickens me.
They only cost 20 cents.
can I ask you a question?
What's a nice girl like me doing
in a place like this? No comment.
Make that "godforsaken place like this."
Godforsaken?
come on.
Where are we going?
church.
Pardon?
church. The oldest one
in America.
Hmm.
come to say good-bye?
Huh?
Good-bye.
Miss Porter,
believe me,
if I could go on my own,
I would.
I just can't have you here
two weeks.
Look, if a hiker passes by, if
Mr. Lewis passes by, even an eagle,
please hitch a ride
and go with them.
Do you think I like it here,
for christ's sake?
I got no liquor, nine cigarettes
and a grease monkey for company.
I want to stay here only marginally
more than I want to die trying to escape.
You laughing in there
or crying?
i, m crying.
- I suppose two weeks isn't that long.
- Oh, no?
What?
Thank you. Thank you.
On one condition.
No story.
Not one word.
Aloof, self-satisfied,
self-sufficient,
surprisingly attractive.
could use some makeup.
christ, my mind is going.
I sound like Rona Barrett.
It's so quiet up here, you
could hear a mouse get a hard-on.
A touch arrogant,
maybe frigid.
It might explain things.
When she goes out-
Mr. souchak, would you-
Sorry. Did I startle
you? No, no, it's not you.
It's, uh-
It's the cigarettes.
They kind of make me jumpy. Oh.
I'm on strict rations. I'm
gonna take a shower now.
Good. Good.
That's always nice.
Ah, sorry.
How's this?
Right. Why don't I just slide outside?
Maybe you can have a cigarette while
you're out. Then you'll be down to seven.
- Ha, ha, ha. What time we leavin' in the morning?
- We?
I thought we had
an agreement.
I just want to see
what you do, that's all.
It's not easy up there,
you know. i, II manage.
I had a cousin
in the Boy Scouts.
How are you doing,
Mr. souchak?
ust great. Just great.
This is so much fun.
I should
get out more.
Be careful around these
rocks. Oh, no problem.
esus christ.
Do you want to rest for a bit? No, not me.
i, m fine.
i can go all day.
I'd like to get this broad
in a bowling alley.
Sheesh.
Shh!
Are you telling me-
No disrespect, Miss Porter,
but it, s no big deal up here.
Hmm.
Okay, i, m decent.
Terrif
c.
You sure you won, tjoin me
in a plate of this?
What is it?
I'm not sure.
"Western omelette mix."
They give it to the
marines as punishment. Mmm.
I wish I could offer you
some of my supplies,
but I hadn't planned on there
being an additional person.
If you're coming with me,
you'd better get ready.
I think
I'll stay back today.
If I go out, this solidif
es again in my stomach.
I thought you did very well
yesterday, considering.
Damn it.
shit. i
'Bear down
hicago Bears '
'No one can forget
the way you thrilled-"
Mmm.
Hi.
Hi.
Dinner's almost ready.
Tough day at the off ce?
What's that?
Goulash.
My grandmother's recipe.
No, no. This.
Not bad, huh? Probably the f rst
thing I ever made with my hands.
No.
Yup.
And the goulash is
by way of celebration.
I had to use real
ingredients for ingredients.
I hope you don't mind.
You're welcome to share my stuff
tomorrow. Maybe I'll fast tomorrow.
Are you expecting company?
Yeah, well, I only had two
cigarettes today. Gets me hungry.
Two cigarettes, ten f ngernails.
You're gonna love this stuff. Hmm.
I have never seen goulash
look... so different.
Well, it's not off cial goulash.
That's what my grandmother
called it.
Of course she also called tuna f sh salmon.
This is good.
This is really delicious.
My compliments
to your grandmother.
She died 20 years ago.
They said it was the goulash.
And thank you
for my lovely door.
Oh, that's nothing. Tomorrow
I'm gonna start on a garage.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Remote control,
the works.
Have you ever quit before?
I'd rather not talk during this
last one, if you don't mind.
You'll go back to chicago
a healthy man.
They'll give you a medal
for saving your own life.
That's it. I'm dead, f nished.
I'll go insane now.
Oh, God. Here come
the withdrawal symptoms.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh! Hey!
Goddamn!
esus christ! What are
you, some kind of nut?
Get over here. ust get over
here! On your stomachs, fast.
We, re from the Department of
the interior, Game Protection.
What the hell
- Shut up, mister! Mr. Harris.
You've just committed a felony punishable by
two to ten years in the federal penitentiary.
That's a bald eagle you're shooting at, and
the American government takes it personally.
We haven't shot any birds. I don't
want to hear about it, Mr. clagett.
Tell it to the judge,
all right?
You have the right
to remain silent.
If you choose to speak, anything
you say may be held against you.
- You have a right to a lawyer.
- That's a $900 shotgun!
Do we need the cuffs
for you?
I don't see where you get
off destroying that shotgun.
Look, mister, there are only 2,000
bald eagles left in North America,
thanks to
an endless supply...
of obscene assholes
like you!
Now...
here's how it's gonna be.
I let you go down the mountain
on your own recognizance.
You report to the ranger station at
Fort creek, talk to captain clark.
He, II have your names. Have you
got that so far? aptain lark.
Oh, one other thing.
If you don't show up there in three
days, you'll be hearing from the F.B.I.
Okay?
This was three years ago.
For some reason, Reginald and claire
abandoned their nest on cougar Ridge...
and they began to build
another nest here,
where Wind River bends at-
what- BridgerJunction, I guess.
Don't do that, please.
I have nice breath. I'm a
nonsmoker. I gave it up for you.
Look, I mean it!
Okay. Okay.
Whatever you say.
Def
nitely frigid.
ery attached
to her walking stick.
I've been forced to give up smoking
and sex in the same lifetime.
Brief moment of panic
in the john today.
I couldn't remember the name of
a single store on Michigan Avenue.
Where, d you learn your
shorthand? Tokyo? Hi!
Hi. I've been reading shorthand
for 15 years, but never like this.
It's my own patent. I
invented it. an you read it?
Or doesn't it matter since it's
only going into a newspaper?
Shall I leave now
and fall into a ravine...
or eat the pages
and choke to death?
I've got a better idea.
Why don't you do a story on me? Pardon?
Marshall Field, Lord &
Taylor, Bonwit Teller,
Stanley Korshak, Saudi
Airways, the Water Tower,
Tiffany's, Saks.
And that, Mr. souchak,
was my moment of truth.
so before I even got back to Boston,
i knew that was going to be my life.
Boston, by the way, is
B-O-S-T-O-N. Thank you.
I decided even before I left
Gambia- That's G-A-M-B-l-A.
I know how to spell Gambia. Sorry.
Why ornithology though?
Why a profession-
I like the uniform.
Pardon?
No, now ask me, didn't my mother prefer me
to settle down, meet some nice accountant?
esus.
Attractive Boston housewife and mother,
Evelyn Porter, 41, stated categorically-
Why are you being such a
hard-ass? What? Not good?
Not gossipy enough? All
right. You win, I lose.
People like talking
about themselves.
They're fascinated
with themselves.
Some people are fascinated
with other people.
That's why they ask them questions. Really?
Really.
Okay.
Right. so you dropped out of
college, you, re bumming around hicago.
Then what?
Since it was the only thing I was good at,
I f gured I might as well get paid for it.
So I became a reporter...
and invented
Souchak shorthand.
Didn't your mother want you to meet
some nice accountant and settle down?
Maybe reporters f nd
other people interesting...
because they're so
goddamn boring themselves.
Souchak, maybe people f nd eagles
interesting for the same reason.
Everybody I know
calls me Souchak.
My name's Ernie. Start
a trend. call me Ernie.
I don't think I could
call you Ernie. Too fancy?
Ernie.
Ernie.
Ernie. Ernie.
Ernie.
I asked you not to do that.
christ, what is it with you?
I don't believe this. You, re
angry. Good God, what an ego.
Forget it. I won't come anywhere
near you. Fine. Thank you.
I need this like I need
mountains and eagles.
Souchak?
What?
This has nothing to do
with what happened tonight.
What hasn't?
What I'm about to say.
What are you
about to say?
You can't come with me
tomorrow.
Fine.
Good. i, m glad
you understand.
Why not?
Some things I do here
I have to do on my own.
esus.
Frigid.
Aah! Son of a-
Hi.
Hello there.
Nice day?
Great. You?
Okay.
What happened
to your thumb?
I cut myself shaving.
Is it all right?
It'll be f
ne.
Are you still angry
about last night?
Last night?
Oh, last night.
I've forgotten
about last night.
Oh, good.
You coming with me tomorrow? No, thanks.
Oh.
Hmm.
Ohh.
Put me down! Put me down,
put me down, put me down!
Stop it! Are you crazy?
You're acting like an animal!
He started it.
Are you all right?
Yeah, it's just my body. I am so sorry.
I had no idea he'd react this
way, not in my lowest estimation.
ust give me a break. I didn't
kill the guy or nothin'.
How did you expect me
to feel?
Who is this faggot?
Max Birnbaum, Ernie Souchak. Max Birnbaum?
Max Birnbaum?
The Brooklyn Behemoth
Birnbaum?
The three-time All-American
at Michigan Birnbaum?
The number-one draft pick of
the Washington Redskins Birnbaum?
The defensive end who told the NFL
to shove it up their defensive end?
That Max Birnbaum?
Well, let me
shake your hand.
This is an honor.
May I have your autograph?
ust like that, Max.
8:35 into the third quarter,
and you walk out.
Eight, nine minutes.
'Round about that.
Exactly 8:35, with everything to
play for. No, everything to lose.
I wanted out.
One season of pro football.
No way I was gonna face a
second, let alone a whole career.
You were rookie of the year.
3.4 sacks a game. I'm going now.
A lot of things started
coming together in my head,
like my revulsion with the whole
system. I have the staff I forgot.
Huh? You know, the staff
that saved your life?
What was it, the coaches? The
owners? Rozelle? Bye. I'm leaving now.
She's really something. She didn't
tell me she had Ernie Souchak up here.
This guy's a big-shot writer. He's
just like I was, only a writer.
You want a laugh?
Yesterday she tells me she's
got a reporter here from chicago.
I used to read
this guy's stuff.
I guess you can't blame her. She's been
out of touch for the past four years.
I'll try not to be late.
Yeah.
You start playin' ball in grade
school, you know. You're just a kid.
You're innocent. Then you start
playin' ball with the big boys.
Ah, baby!
Oh.
You dig him,
don't you?
That's ridiculous. No,
it's okay. He's a good man.
That's got nothing
to do with it.
I just want us to-
Max?
It think it's maybe coming up
to 8:35 in the third quarter.
Is it 'cause we don't talk? I
don't mind you talkin' to him.
It makes no difference
to what we do.
No, it's not that.
As long as you're okay,
Nell.
And if you ever feel like
you kinda sometimes feel-
See you.
Uh-oh.
What?
Trouble.
Oh?
Am I allowed to mention you? Oh.
All I say is that he's your friend,
and I chanced to meet him because you-
We, re not friends exactly. No?
I mean... we've spoken
a few times.
Uh-huh.
Acquaintance, really.
Well... maybe friend.
Right.
Not close friend.
No.
I've never heard you so quiet
since you came here.
This is the f rst story I've written since
I came here. Fixing doors is just a hobby.
Ah. I assume that one ex-jock rates
higher than 2,000 bald eagles...
at the hicago sun-Times.
You want me to write
about eagles?
Ernest, I am trying
to work here.
If you wanna yell Max Birnbaum's
name from the treetops,
please do so quietly.
I'll check the facts with him
when he gets back.
He won't be back.
He won, t?
I'm too busy to have people
hanging around here!
Hmm.
When I was up here last spring,
they had two eaglets.
Bruno and Sarah.
I just hope Sarah didn't
murder her brother.
They do that? Mmm. To get his food.
Really?
The young female
is dominant.
Whoa!
Holy shit.
It's nature's way.
Where we're going
there are no trees.
chicago?
Watch out for loose rocks.
What beats me is not only someone
made this, not only someone sold it,
but that someone
actually bought it.
It flatters the wearer.
Is that right?
What do you think?
ery good looking, wouldn't you say? Mmm.
What are you doing? I'm
gonna get in there with you.
No. Please don't.
What, are you nuts?
No, look, there's no reason to
hurry. All the hurry is down below.
I'm still on chicago time.
I know that, but I'm not!
And I don't want you!
Ernie,
try to understand.
What's to understand?
Good night.
Nature.
Understand nature.
Out here you only survive by
understanding your opponent.
Opponent?
Thanks a lot.
No, look, if y-
if you want to tame
or conquer or anything,
you have to imagine what it's like being
the object of that conquest, or whatever.
Imagine what it feels like
actually being them.
And that applies...
whether it, s an eagle
or a mountain, a stream...
or me.
It's the same thing.
Lecture over?
It's no big deal.
Then don't sulk.
Lady, where I come from
there's no such word.
Oh, yeah?
Well, what do they call it
where you come from?
Souchak,
take it easy.
ust move slowly. Don't try to go too fast.
There are good handholds
right there, to the left.
You, re doing fine,
souchak.
You, re almost here.
All right?
Whoa! Ohh!
Don't pull me over.
You did well.
come on.
There's Max.
He doesn, t like us here.
Why don, t we leave?
Don, t you want to know
if Bruno made it?
Oh, right. Bruno.
Where's my head at
these days?
Shh.
I can't feel my f ngers.
I hope
we don't fall off.
I'd hate to
disturb them.
Dear Lord, I'm sorry to
keep troubling you,
but i, m hanging
from a rock here.
Now, i, m not complaining. I just
- Look. i
Look, it's Bruno.
Huh?
He's alive!
Bruno?
is that him?
Uh-huh.
Go for it, Bruno. i
Look at that. i
Bruno, s alive. i
He made it. i
Hey, Bruno!
The Indians believed that a bald eagle
could push the sun across the sky...
and that it was the heat of the sun
that turned their head feathers white.
The sun? The sun. Tell me
more about the heat of the sun.
You did great
out there today.
Here.
This is for you.
It's an eagle feather.
Mmm.
It was a sign of strength
and courage to the Indians,
and a brave could only wear it
after he proved himself in battle.
How's that look?
Nice.
Ernie? Ernie, wake up.
esus, I'm shaking.
Everything I've got
is shaking.
Must be the withdrawal symptoms.
Yeah. Withdrawal symptoms.
come here. I want to show
you something. come on. What?
Oh.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Mmm.
Tricky climbing.
Don't worry
about me, babe.
You're talking to
a feather owner.
Hey, let me take the lead for a while.
I've been watching
how you do it.
Oh, really?
come on.
It'll be fun.
It'll be interesting. Yeah.
That's what worries me.
Well, please be careful.
All right?
No problem.
Let me put a rope on you. And I
don't wanna hear about your cousin-
In the Boy Scouts-
Ernie. i
Ernie?
Lie still
and catch your breath.
Put your arms down.
Do you feel broken anywhere?
No.
How's your head? How many of me do you see?
One.
Looks nice.
Do you think
you can move at all?
I think dancing's
out of the question.
Let's get-
Aah! christ!
I slipped my entire back.
All right, just lie down.
Take it easy, all right?
Lie still.
catch your breath.
Let's hear it
for the chef.
Thanks.
Wouldn, t it have been
easier to call an ambulance?
is this
too tight?
No getting in with me.
No dice.
I promise.
Okay.
We lost the dogs.
They're gone.
Don't worry.
I've got you.
Aah.
Oh, my God.
Hang on, Ernie.
Boy, this is some fun.
Sorry.
Are you all right?
I'm just f
ne.
We, II trade places
after a while.
You okay?
I'm tired.
It's today.
Hmm?
Deke Lewis is supposed to
come get me today.
Don't hold your breath.
There.
Don't move.
I could try to get a helicopter
for you on the shortwave.
They may come
for an emergency.
You know, I think
it's just sprained.
If I could rest it
a little while-
We'll see how it is
in a few days.
Yeah, I'm sure it's gonna be
a lot better in a few days.
Mmm.
Oh, that's good.
Little lower.
Yeah?
How is it here?
Oh, yeah-
How is it
here?
Better,
I guess.
correction.
Day one I wrote she
could use a little makeup.
I was young and foolish.
She should never use it.
She's flush and rosy and-
Get ahold of yourself,
Souchak.
You're a little ripe
to be this breathless.
Okay. Are you calm?
Good.
That, s more like it.
slow down.
Are you sure
about this?
Hell, you've neglected
your work long enough.
I can get to the head
and to the refrigerator.
What more is there
to life?
Put the roast in at 3:00? can do, skip.
There's nothing
I can get you?
No, you kids go have a good
time, leave Grandpa here.
He'll be all right
by himself.
Bye. Bye
- Nope. Leave the door open.
I wanna watch you leave.
I enjoy the view.
See you later.
Bye-bye.
There was a crooked man
And he ran a crooked mile
Oh, my.
He found a crooked sixpence
Against a crooked stile
He bought
a crooked cat
' Who caught
a crooked mouse '
'And they all
lived together '
'in a crooked
little house"
Oh, shit.
Hello. can I help you? We're
entirely at your service.
Uh, take anything you like.
We got a shower
and everything.
You big pussycat.
You think I'm afraid of that?
Well, you sense fear,
don't you?
But I won't show any.
Oh!
You don, t know that theory,
do ya?
Okay.
Oh.
You want the roast.
Right.
Okay.
Here you go.
it, s yours.
We'll have something else.
Don't worry about us.
Well, i-
i, II be going now.
see you later.
ust, uh,
take what you like...
and lock up
when you leave, okay?
i, II just step
out of your way here.
Oh, God.
esus.
Ernie!
Ernie?
How was your day?
Oh, Jesus.
This could set me back
a few days.
Weeks.
But you came out f
ne.
You were very lucky,
you know.
I owe it all to you.
Why?
Understanding nature,
imagining
you're the opponent.
In that split second
that mattered,
I imagined that I was
that mountain lion.
And what would discourage me
if I were a mountain lion?
I took my walking stick...
and hit him in the balls.
I'd never seen such big
balls, and I'm from chicago.
You're turning into
quite a mountain man. Mmm.
You may decide
to stay up here.
If I learn one more
mountain skill, I'll be dead.
You're doing f
ne.
How does your head feel?
Which one?
Where does it hurt?
Does it hurt up here?
Does it hurt there?
Mmm.
Maybe over here.
Mmm. Ooh.
ery painful. Ow.
Let me see
what's going on over here.
Howard?
Uh-huh?
How, s the patient?
in my book, technically dead.
He walks around with that
goddamn tree trunk in his hand.
He hasn, t written a word
since he got back.
she, s got a lot to answer for, that
woman. I have a newspaper to run.
i could kill her.
For years I make dinner parties
to fix him up with a nice girl,
and he goes and falls
for an eagle freak.
i should never have sent him
out of town it, s unnatural.
On the other hand,
you can, t expect her to give
up her life, s work just for him.
Hey, Souchak! Souchak!
Whose side are you on?
He can, t expect her to do that.
You did it for me.
You had no regrets.
What's that look
supposed to mean?
What look?
That look.
I've gotta go.
Mmm.
And you've got
a newspaper to run.
Be careful
on the way out.
There's a zombie
out there.
Oh, my God.
she must be one hell
of a mountain goat.
This has got to stop.
Bye, honey.
Bye-bye.
souchak, would you come
into my office, please.
Well?
i want you writing again.
You've been sitting around here
pickling your brain for two weeks.
It's enough already.
Maybe writing about it
will clean it out.
I don't want to write
about her.
Fine.
Write about
being back in town.
You can start writing
about Yablonowitz again.
Who?
Yablonowitz.
Yablonowitz!
Yablonowitz!
You remember him?
He's still around, you know.
All he had to do
after your last column...
was issue a press release
and fire a few relatives.
Uh-huh.
Now look, for my sake
as managing editor,
write something.
Anything. i
You told me it was for your sake last time.
I'm saying it again.
I'm saying it again.
Souchak, go see a shrink.
I give up.
It's a travel piece.
People love travel pieces.
When they're good.
Even when they're lousy.
These aren't good enough
to be lousy.
Tryin' to let me down easy,
aren't ya? Listen to this.
I know what I wrote, Howard. I
was there when I wrote it. Mm-hmm.
"And the mountain rises higher,
and yet higher, thrusting upward,
"straining ever upward, burgeoning its
power from the very loins of the earth,
"its peak piercing at last
the center of the sun,
until its golden, molten,
melting light explodes in a-,'
Am I right in thinking there's
something you're trying to tell us here?
"The undulating hillocks, round
and smooth and full and fertile,
sloping globes curving
gently, deeply down to the-,'
I mean, where do you suggest we print it
- Penthouse?
I was doing you a favor.
Thanks.
ust to show you how grateful I am, I
promise you nobody will ever read this.
You'd be laughed
out of chicago.
- come on.
- Where we going?
To get drunk.
Oh, I like new ideas.
You take my liquor,
but you won't take my advice.
Your advice sobers me up.
Ahh.
Where are you going?
This is the paper
you used to write for.
Every time I turn my back, they
got the state senate in the lead.
Who gives a shit
about the state senate?
"Who Gives A Shit
About The State Senate?"
Holy cow.
I don't believe it.
What's wrong?
I want some answers!
Nobody has any answers?
I want to know how a thing like
this disappears from my off ce.
I found it on your desk.
You found it on my desk?
You print six pages of crap because
you see something laying on my desk?
Well, I hope to hell I don't leave my tax
returns laying on my desk one day by mistake!
The byline
was Ernie Souchak.
Look, you moron,
don't give me excuses!
If it's Souchak,
you always run it.
You hear what
i just told him?
You know what would happen to me
if I did what you morons did, huh?
i, d be back selling
brassieres on Maxwell street.
Phew.
Thank you. Thank you for your support.
You know what I think?
I bet you're gonna tell
me. You just told me.
Keep this up,
you'll end up buried...
along with
"chicago Grandmother Graduates,"
"Park Statue
To Get Face-lift,"
"city Hall clerk's Fire Escape Death," "Weather Forecast
What was that?
The weather forecast?
The f
re escape.
"Mr. Kermit Hellinger, 31,
"fell to his death early
today from a f re escape...
"at the back of a disused
warehouse on Murphy Street.
Mr. Hellinger, a contracts clerk at city Hall, leaves a wife and one
Ambassador Restaurant.
You, re a naughty, naughty man.
Well, if it isn, t
our intrepid explorer.
That's all right, Mike. Where's
your next assignment? Outer space?
I know what really happened
on Murphy Street.
And if I know, you can bet
your spotty, fat ass...
that pretty soon
chicago will.
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.
What are you showering in
these days, Jack Daniel's?
The last place he'd go is up a f re escape.
Which is exactly why it was
his last. Right, Alderman?
Get this drunk outta here!
Enjoy your dessert, punk!
Let go of me! Your ass
is mine! Let go of me!
Everybody
say "cheese."
You got it.
Well, yes
- Yes. I can give you names and places and dates.
Up there? No?
In the alley?
This is it.
This is the one.
Holy cow.
i don, t believe it.
All right!
Why didn't you
wait for me?
I thought you deserved
a solo entrance.
We did all right, Howard,
didn't we? Terrif c.
Then why aren't you
smiling?
What?
Didn't you read
the front page?
The question is, did you? Huh?
I just want to establish you
are really over her, that's all.
esus, Howard, you're
almost a man of the world.
You know how
these things happen.
The air was thin.
She was average cute.
There was no other broad
around, and the air was thin.
Well, I have a newspaper to run. So?
So I don't want you
turning into cream pie again.
Howard, if Nell Porter were to take one of
her eagles for a stroll down Michigan Avenue...
and I happened
to bump into them,
I'd say hi, I might kiss them on the beak.
And then
I'd wave good-bye.
That's how over her
I am.
Then you're not going
to her lecture tonight?
No, thanks.
Good. I'd rather you didn't. Well, I'm not.
Good. Better that you don't.
I'm not, for christ's sake.
For the paper's sake.
Good.
Fine.
Fine.
Good.
The problem now
is really not hunters.
The laws are adequate
on that score.
But these invisible killers,
these pesticides and pollutants,
are poisoning the fish they eat,
the water they drink,
the air they soar through.
it, s not easy protecting them, but we must.
We have no choice.
There are only 700 nesting pairs
in the lower 48 states.
in all, just 2,000
American bald eagles.
That, s all that remain.
Ladies and gentlemen,
they must be saved.
Thank you.
Oh, shit.
If there are any questions, Dr. Porter
will be more than delighted to answer them.
Yes?
i was reading that-
i understand they have a
dramatic way of making love.
Oh, shit.
Uh, mating.
Mating. Right.
Yes.
Uh, f rst they chase each other,
uh, circling, dipping,
twisting, screaming.
Testing.
And then?
Then they come together,
their talons locking.
inseparable?
For a short,
very happy time, yes.
can they fly that way?
No, not together.
They begin to fall, plunging
and tumbling, down and down.
It sounds dangerous.
But thrilling.
Huh? Wha
- Yes. And then?
Then when they, re
very near the ground,
About to be smashed?
they separate,
open their wings...
and soar
on the air currents.
- Alone?
- Each alone. That's the only way they can fly.
And that's all there is?
Unless they do it again.
Uh, yes?
What are you
doing here, huh?
What's so funny? I got
a paper to run. Remember?
This what you call keeping your
word about not coming to the lecture?
Huh?
Howard.
Don't "Howard" me, all right?
Whose side are you on, huh?
I'm over you completely,
by the way.
Me too- over you.
Totally.
Entirely.
I've got a great idea. Hmm?
Let's stay here
forever.
We're gonna have to.
Why?
My apartment exploded in excitement
when it heard you were coming.
We could call room service every
two weeks for a quick goulash.
Mm-hmm!
Mmm!
come back with me.
You can write a novel there. Ehh-
I like writing
just my column.
It's short.
I'll make you very,
very happy, Mr. Souchak.
Mmm.
Why is it
you're so damn beautiful?
I'm not.
You're just in love.
So am I.
I'm gonna prove to you
that you can live here.
Forget it.
I mean,
there's no point.
You want some goulash?
Mm-mmm.
I never touch the stuff.
You don't want anything?
Mm-mmm. Nothing.
Then I got
a real surprise.
Howard, maybe they, re deciding
to bejust good friends.
Maybe he, s dumped her.
That, s it. Maybe at sea level
she, s just one big turnoff.
Oh, Howard, enough.
I like the girl.
So?
I'd like for her to be happy. Mm-hmm.
And Souchak...
at last.
And what about me-
a man with a newspaper to run.
Oh, for God's sakes.
Maybe if I just talked to him
- Maybe we get some sleep.
Maybe you're worrying about nothing. Maybe.
Hey, I'm here too,
you know.
Wrap yourself
in your damn newspaper.
To live in hicago you have to
learn that you only survive...
by understanding your opponent, Dr. Porter.
First you have to remember
the number- 9-1-1.
That's the police.
Now, the line'll be busy because the
rest of chicago is trying to survive...
just like you are.
Hi, Fiddle.
second, never touch anyone
on the street.
They'll think you need help,
and they'll kill you.
And for God's sakes, never smile at anyone
- they'll think you're gay.
In which case,
don't call 9-1-1.
They'll book you
for an obscene phone call.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Fourth,
never cross the street...
when you hear
an ambulance coming.
It's very dangerous, because
it's you it's trying to run down.
And there's one last thing
to know. ery important.
It's about money
- never carry any in your purse.
Keep your folding money
in your shoe.
You can always tell how rich a person is by the way he limps
- like this.
This is a great town.
It's got everything.
Especially you.
What?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
There is.
I don't know
what you mean.
There, s something wrong.
There isn,t.
Look. i Eagles. i
Pigeons.
Well, they're birds
anyway.
I still want to know
what's wrong.
And I still don't know
what you mean.
What I mean is,
all you do is kiss me and
look at me like I'm gonna die.
There you go again.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
There's a 10:00 train.
Train. Perfect.
I love you.
Then why are you gonna
make us both miserable?
What else can we be?
My life is in the Rockies.
Yours is obviously here.
But there's no answer.
I don't regret
any of it.
Great.
I won't forget any of it either. Terrif c.
Look, I've never been one for
butting in where I don't belong.
You know what I mean? I always
liked that about you, Howard.
Oh, Souchak,
you are impossible.
christ.
Sylvia.
Sylvia!
I'm sorry.
I think I'd better go.
Please say good-bye
to Sylvia for me.

to see you again.
This is a final boarding call
