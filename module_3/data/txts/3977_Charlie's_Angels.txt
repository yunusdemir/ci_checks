Whoo!


Help! Help!
We need help
Thank goodness you stopped!
What happened?
Don't know.
Must guy washed up here
Come on, breathe, please
I'm calling 911.
You guys see anything?
I don't know
No
We have an unconscious man at the beach
Breathe for me!
Quantum Sands
Hurry
You're OK, you're OK. What's your name?
Where am I?
Miami Beach
What's going on?
Just tell us your name
My name is...
I don't know my name
I don't know
'Once upon a time, there were three young women
'who got into very big trouble
'Now they work for me
'My name is Charlie.'
'Nurse Allen, you havea phone call on line one...'
Hey, I brought some clothes
I hope they fit
Thanks, Bos
How do you guys think he ended up on that beach?
Looks like he's taken a like to you
Well, she did give him mouth to mouth
Come on!
Is that what we're calling it?
Excuse me. Your John Doe's
had major trauma
That could account for his memory loss
Wait, are we talking about amnesia?
The diagnostic term is dissociatave amnesia
Well, is he OK?
No sign of head or internal injuries
so whatever's caused his memory
loss is just all up here
Is it permanent?
His memory could come back with therapy
medication and the support mechanism at home
We don't even know if he has a home
So what happens now?
He'll be released
To who? He doesn't remember a thing
Well, we'll call social services in Miami PD
but we just don't have the
bed space to keep him here
You don't have to call social services
He can come with us
I guess it's settled
OK
Can I see him?
Sure
'Forgive me, but I thought this was your day off?'
I thought it was
but your angels seem to attract
trouble wherever they go
It is not our fault that Eve
has a soft spot for strays
Er, excuse me, I heard that
Hugo is upstairs taking a shower
'You said he had no name.'
He had a suit, like Hugo Boss
An amnesiac with good taste
'Did he have anything on him that might
help discover his identity?'
A key with 815 on it
'Abby, sounds like your department'
I've already sent a digital imprint over to Romana
Who's Romana?
My key-maker
But I thought you were the master lock-picker?
Who do you think taught me?
Ramona is the Wikipedia of keys
If this thing opens anything in
theWestern Hemisphere, she'll find it
In the meantime, I'll run his
prints through the databases
I have friends in missing persons
checking for open case files
that fit Hugo's description
'Sounds like you've gotyour
marching orders without me.'
We'll keep you posted, Charlie
'Just remember, sometimes, strays bite.
Be careful, Angels.'
You're good at this. Ex-cop?
Ex-thief
But now you're a private detective?
Yeah, with three other ex-criminals
for a man we've never met
Wow! Thanks
Thanks for what?
For making my amnesia the normal
part of this conversation
I don't need to meet my boss
Charlie gave me a second chance
when the rest of the world had written me off
That's why you didn't leave meon the beach?
Thanks...
for saving my life
You're welcome

How are those prints coming along?
Good
We're done
You must be exhausted?
Why don't you go upstairs, rest up for a bit?
OK. I think I will
Hey, Bos
Hey. Prints?
Yes
No matches
Good, proves he's not a bad guy
Or that he hasn't been caught and finger printed
Does he really look like a
criminal master mind to you?
And what does a criminal master mind look like?
That's a good question
OK, thanks
That was missing persons
No-one's looking for Hugo, but I
went through his police reports
Apparently, a Cadillac CTS
went off the MacArthur Causeway early this morning
Airbags were deployed, but no bodies were found
Maybes Hugo's our Cadillac guy. Any plates?
The police report doesn't say
The car was brand-new
Depending on the currents, Hugo could've drifted
from the causeway to the beach he washed up on
Well, the time frame makes sense
Anyone fish out the Caddie?
It was towed to the impound lot in the marina
Why don't I take Hugo there?
Maybe seeing the car will jog his memory
Good idea. I'll go with you
It's OK, I've got it
This is a safe key, one of 1,600 ordered
to the exact specs of theSunshine
State Bank And Trust
So is it a safe bet that this
opens safety deposit box 815?
Let's go find out
Follow my lead
Excuse me? This area's restricted
Hi, how are you?
I'm with Amalgamated Insurance Company.
We have a claim with the Caddie
recovered from the bay last night
OK, and you are?
I'm, er, her supervisor
It's my first week as an insurance adjuster
OK. It's at the end of aisle five
It's the one leaking the seawater
Thank you
Call me...if you need anything
You see how easy that was?
Yeah, I'm a natural
You OK?
I'm just wondering how I managedto
drive my car off a bridge
You're probably just a really crappy car driver
With no ID or finger prints
You're are a man of mystery
I just hope I like the person I find
How do you feel about him so far?
Well, pretty good, but I
guess having no regrets'll do that
No regrets - I like that philosophy
You mean my condition?
Yes, your condition
Can I help you?
Good God, that's my car?
Unless someone else drove it
off the Causeway last night
Well, I don't think it was me
Whoever it was was shot at with an
assault rifle by the looks of these
Why would anybody want to do that to me?
I don't know. Let's make sure this is your car
No insurance, no registration, no rental agreement
I've got something like postcard or a flyer
Does it bring back anything?
No, nothing
You know it's going to be OK, right?
Well, it looks pretty far from OK right now
Somebody wants me dead
We're going to find out who
Eve!
No!

Give me the gun! Give me the gun
Give me the gun
I almost shot that guy!
But you didn't!
Only cos you stopped me

Who am I?
I don't know

♪ I love them bad boysl love them bad boys... ♪
Bos and Hugo are checking photos to
try and ID the guy who attacked him
I just wish you could've seen how
quickly he disarmed that guy
Sounds like he went from Hugo Boss to Jason Bourne
Like someone flipped a switch
What do you think? Military, Blackwater?
That's the happy version
The scary one is he could be
a professional hitman or even a mercenary
Let's not go there
OK, what about the guy who attacked you?
He was Asian, average height
no distinguishing marks other than the gun
But did he say anything?
Many he was a disgruntled former
colleague or even partner in crime?
Why do we always have to assume the worst?
You need to check this out...OK
We got this from safe 815 from the
Sunshine State Bank And Trust
Exhibit A
It's adorable
Yeah, it gets dark
Look at this
I'm guessing the money's untraceable?
Yeah
He used it along with a false name
to pay for his safety deposit box
What name?
Francis Fratelli
From The Goonies?
The gun's serial numbers have been filed off
Don't ask about the dolphin
I'm dying to know about the dolphin
Us too
We want to run the gun against
the Miami PD ballistics database,
see if I can get a match
I'll see you girls in a bit
Ciao, bella
There's gotta be an explanation
Are you OK if it's an ugly one?
I... I just think that...
I know what it's like to be alone in the world
and I think that's what he is right now
I know. Well, sooner or later
he'll have his memories backand
we'll have a full picture
I just don't want you to get hurt
So, you have no idea of how you
were able to defend yourself?
Well, I do have an excuse
It doesn't mean I can't ask the question
I doubt I could do it again
Not bad. I'm guessing you were
er, marines, special forces?
You can let go now
Let me ask you a question. Eve, is she single?
Why don't you figure out
which side of the law you're
on than worry about dating?
If I stepped on your toes asking...
Guys?
Hope you two are playing nice
Just getting to know each other
Is everything OK?
Yeah, there's something I need to show you
Where did I get all this money?
Well, that was at your safety deposit box
at the Sunshine State Bank And Trust.
I'm guessing whoever I was didn'tleave
some photo ID or something?
No, it was paid for with a fake name
OK, um, what about this dolphin?
Maybe you're a stuffed-toy aficionado
Or not. It's an idea
What about the postcard?
The one I found in the car?
Yeah, it's a commercially available
stock photo of South Beach
It's been used for book covers, a
postcard, a flyer for Nikki Beach
Nikki Beach?
You remember it?
Yeah!
It's a beach club, dancing, DJs, tepees?
Um...
Do you think you've been there?
I think I was there
For a man with no memory, you have
good taste in clothes and parties
I was following a guy
He was a regular at the bar
I don't suppose you know that guy's name?
No, no, but...
He had dark hair, brown, not much of it
He had a goatee

Two more
Here's those drinks!
Oh, look, it's like a little traffic light!
Yeah! Mm-hm!
Yeah!
Well, to life at the beach
That's cool, yeah!
That's like not the guyl remembered
You hear that guys?
' Got it.'
Abby, we just rolled snake eyes.
Ditch the goatee and find another
I'm waiting for facial recognition
in case anyone rings a bell
So I got a placenear the fountain blue
a beautiful view of the ocean, we
could watch the sunrise together
Yeah, I am so sorry, you're going
to be rising and shining alone
but you did a really good job
today and I don't want you
to feel bad about it and
this is very...contemporary
Cheers
That's perfect. Ooh!

Any more goatees in your sights?
Mmm, this whole place is goatees
Totally
Would you think less of me if I
told you I liked this drink?
Yes!
Oh, wait a minute
What's happening?!
Hi!
My mum's out of town!
I've got the whole place to myself
We can use the big room!
That's not him
Give him the hand, Kate
I'm Rick. You're gorgeous
You're not, sorry. You've gotta go
I can't... I am speechless
I can't imagine myself hanging
out at a place like this
It could be worse. You could have a goatee
You know, part of me hopesmy
memory never comes back
Clean slate?
Yeah, it's like a second chance
That's actually the name of my boat
Really?
Yeah, it's docked at the quays
I thought you were a car girl?
Oh, I am, I used to live on a boat
before it got sprayed up by bullets
Past life
That's why you call it Second Chance?
Er, yeah, that and it is my second boat
I don't know what kind of guy
you used to be, Hugo, but...
you don't seem like a bad one
Well... I'll try and stay in your good graces
And I don't know what my
life was about before, but...
right now, it seems like
it's probably better with you around
Hey, sorry to interrupt your moment
but Abby's got another candidate in her sights
Can I buy you a shot?
You know, I am, I'm just not a shot kind of person
I have bottle service at my cabana
That's him
Of course you do, everybody does
Abby, get his glass, I'll run
his prints and get an ID
God, you know, I'm just in a really bad mood
with this heat, and your
cabana just sounds so great
Um, so why don't you give me a second to go
freshen up and change my attitude
and I will see you there in a second, OK?
I'm so happy we met, so, so happy
That was easy
Nice job
Get Hugo away in case goatee guy wants him dead
I'll meet you there
Sounds good. Hugo, let's get you out of here
I need answers
Hugo!
Hugo!

Shots fired!

Hugo!
We need to talk.
Who are you?
Detective Bradley Dumont, LAPD

The man you know as Hugo Bossis
actually named Josh Taylor
He joined the LAPD out of the Marine corps
He was working undercover with
the DEA joint task force
Well, this explains why we
couldn't find anything on him
These files were taken offline
and sealed to protect his cover
Now, unfortunately, he crossed the line
Taylor put a bullet in his partner two months ago
and ran off with LAPD buy money
.I've been tracking him ever since
I just don't believe it
Look, I hate to be the bearer
Josh Taylor is as dirty as they come
I'm just glad your association with him
ended before he led you somewhere ugly
I wasn't aware it was over
We're PIs. He's our client
How does our dead guy, Lapointe, fit in?
Yeah, why would Hugo or Josh
want to kill him in cold blood?
Look, you can investigate all you want
but the operational details of my
case are extremely sensitive
The way I see it, you're working with a wanted man
A wanted man with amnesia. Why not check that?
I'm just not buying that story and
you might not want to believe it
but Josh Taylor is a
dangerous and violent socio path
Do yourselves a favour and stay out of this case
There's no happy ending here for him
'I made some calls
'Josh Taylor's partner was shot and killed
in Los Angeles two months ago
'just like Dumont told us
'The police haven't released the names of suspects
But they do have one?
'Yes, it's Josh.'
It just doesn't sound right
'I'm sorry, Eve, this is confirmed.'
What about Brad Dumont?
'A spotless record and considere done
of LAPD's best detectives.'
I was considered one of Miami
PD's best and brightest
'What's your point, Kate?'
I'm just not convinced Brad Dumont's
intentions are all so noble
What makes you say that?
Gut feeling
Look, cop killers are big game
Dumont knows no-one's going to blame a detective
that shoots first and asks questions later
You think Dumont's planning on killing Josh?
'I've a low tolerance for vendettas
'You need to find Joshbefore Dumont does
Eve and I are on it
Abby and I will look into Lapointe
'Go to it, Angels, but tread lightly.'
Thanks, Doyle, I owe you one.
That was a buddy of mine in Traffic
The cops talked to all the cab companies
The doorman at Nicky Beach put Hugo in a taxi
The driver dropped him off on J Street
Sure? That's five blocks from Manatee Quays
Isn't that where you keep your boat?
He just wants a second chance
Let's go
Lapointe owned a bunch of
souvenir shops along Miami Beach
I, of course, hacked into his company's database
So...can you make anything of these?
These are import-export contracts,
primarily with Chinese suppliers
Import-export is a good business
if you're thinking of smuggling
13 pallets of snow globes to
be transported to the port of Miami
It freaks me out when you do that
Who knew all those hours my father forced
me to learn Mandarin paid off
Is our blue dolphin in a contract?
Only one way of finding out
Print out the contracts and
I'll translate over lunch
Should I order Chinese?

Hey, stop!
All right!
I see you found my gun
I didn't shoot that guy
Then put the gun down and talk to us
His name was Greg Lapointe. Why did you run?
Because I saw who did and I
knew he was going to kill me next
We believe you, Josh
Now put down the gun
Wait, my name is Josh?
Detective Josh Taylor. You're with LAPD
I'm a cop?! How did I end up in Miami?
We're not sure but there's another
detective looking for you
Brad Dumont. Does that name ring a bell to you?
No. Is he my partner?
Not exactly
Wait, that's the guy from the club
That's the guy who killed Lapointe
So I'm a dirty cop who killed his partner?
His name's John Corry
I shot him.This just doesn't seem real
We don't want to believe it either
Yes, but it's hard to fight this evidence
Do you remember anything about Lapointe?
What kind of business you guys had?
No, it's a mess. It's like
puzzle pieces that don't fit together
But without your memory, all
we have is Dumont's word
OK. So, I'm a cop
Maybe I was investigating Lapointe?
Or maybe this Brad Dumont
guy and I were working together
and he killed Lapointe to...
I don't know. I'm sorry
I just...maybe... I wouldn't blame you
if you turned me in right now
With dirty cops, the story
is never black-and-white
I know it looks bad but you can't lose faith
We're all about second chances here
Lapointe's Chinese contact inside
the united States is this man
Frankie Han
Sound familiar?
No. But those Chinese
characters...I recognise them
I don't know what they are but I've seen them
They're Triad markings
The Chinese Mafia
Frankie Han runs the South Florida branch
We need to have a conversation with Frankie
Getting close won't be easy
Maybe we just call Dumont and share this with him
It's not my first choice
Frankie Han does own a ridiculously over-priced
Asian fusion restaurant
You know, I always thought the prices were criminal
Now I know why
Check out the swag
The Ming Dynasty called.
They want their vases back
Ha! Time to find Frankie Han and get him bugged
Ahem!
You must be the replacements?
We are. So I heardthe waitresses were arrested?
By immigration. Tell me your papers are in order
Oh, yeah, we are not going to cause a problem
You'd better not. Pick up a tray at
the bar and work the lounge area
You - main dining room
They need back up on tables five to eleven
So how do you pick who gets to
dress up for these missions?
Depends on the outfit
All right, people. Let's focus
'Bos?'
OK. I've got Abby. Go ahead, Abby
I think I have something.Check it out
That room looks restricted
Wait a minute. I recognise him
Isn't that the guy at the impound?
I think I could get past him, if
only I had a distraction. Kate?
I'm on it
Oh! I am so sorry
Let me help. Let me help you with that
Oh, let me help. Sorry! Sorry
It's OK
Heading into the back room now
It's OK
Blow on them
I found Frankie Han
Can you get close enough to bug him?
Well, he likes girls, he likes booze
I think I can figure something out
'What are you doing here?'
Well, I was just bringing Mr Hanhis drink
I already have a drink
I'm sorry, sir, I...
Come on, let's go
Uh-oh. Ladies, we got a problem
Brad Dumont just showed up
I'll slow him down
Hey, you're not going anywhere
Last time, someone wound up dead
So, guys, want me to roll down a
window - let out some testosterone?
They're private detectives, working with Taylor
Why don't you ladies come to the back room?
'All right. Buy me time, I'm
getting you out of there.'
How?
Watch and learn.
'Almost there, Abby. Pulling the trigger in five.'
You're going to pull the fire alarm?
It's a fire-suppression system
It uses a non-toxic gas so
Frankie's priceless antiquities
don't sustain fire or water damage
Four
We don't need weapons to blow this place apart
'Three.'
This is your final warning
'Two.'

All right, let's go!
Nice one, Bosley
I have my moments
Let's see what's on the bug
I thought you didn't get close enough to Han
No, but I got close enoughto his bodyguard
I think you guys might want to listen to this
'Calm down, Frankie.'
'Don't tell me to calm down!
'Taylor was your responsibility.
Now he has private detectives on me?'
Look, they came on a fishing
tripand left empty-handed
They found my involvement in this, didn't they?
'Josh Taylor has amnesia.He won't get in the way.'
You're damn right. You're going to
take care of him and his associates
I dealt with his partner and I'll deal with this...
after I get my piece of the Coral Dragon shipment
Coral Dragon?
Dumont killed my partner
And he's framing you to take the fall
I am not a killer
I know you're not
Coral Dragon is a cargo ship containing
ten of Frankie Han's containers
It came in this morning. Port of Miami
They were off loaded into a ware house by the docks
But what's in those containers?
Crates and crates full of these
Hey, hands up!
Well, anybody want a souvenir?
What is it?
There is nothing in these.They are just toys
Makes no sense. They wouldn't go
through this for stuffed animals
Maybe they are using the dolphins as a distraction
A silica gel.It's supposed to keep the toys dry
That look like silica gel to you?
No, what is that?
Illegal drugs?
Wait a minute, I remember something
.I have seen this before
It's a synthetic painkiller
Hit the streets of LA aboutsix months ago
There was a bad batch.A lot of people died
And you are all going to die for seeing it.
Drop the guns
We've got you surrounded
Keep your hands where I can see 'em
Well, well, well. I can't say it surprises me
It is one hell of a wayto end a partnership, Brad
You and I were never partners
Not as cops, maybe, but as criminals
You didn't tell Mr Han aboutour deal?
Hugo? What are you doing?
I'm not letting this guy put a bullet in
me without Mr Han knowing why
What is this?
Brad sent me to Miamito follow Lapointe
We were going to sellthe drugs ourselves
Nice story. This man has amnesia.
He doesn't even know who I am
Right, the amnesia
Thanks for that idea, Brad. It worked well
It was almost as goodas taking the drugs to LA
and selling out the Triadsto the DEA
He's lying!
Put your gun down

Are you OK?

Oh! No, no, no.
Night-night, partner
No!
Hugo
Look at me
I'm calling 911
You're OK
'Dr Kravitz, a visitor in the main lobby
Hi
Hi
How are you feeling?
You tell me
The doctor said you're going
to make a full recovery
What about Dumont and Frankie Han?
DEA custody
Turns out you were right.I'm one of the good guys
Yeah, you are
Thanks for believing in me
Maybe when you get out of here
we can make some new memories
Look, Eve, there is somethingl have to tell you
When I took that bullet...something happened
I remembered
What did you remember?
Daddy!
Josh! Thank God!
Hi
I'm so glad we found you. We were so afraid
Bethany...and Chloe
This is Eve
Hi
She's a private detective
The Townsend Agency? The police told
me everything you did my husband
Thank you so much
You're welcome
Hi
Bye, Josh
He just found out
I'm sorry
It's OK
Told you he was a good guy
I know that
You still have Abby and Kate
And me, of course
