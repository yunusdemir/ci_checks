My mind is clearer now
At last, all too well
I can see
Where we all
soon will be
lf you strip away
The myth from the man
You will see
Where we all
soon will be
Jesus
You've started to believe
the things they say of you
You really do believe
this talk of God is true
And all the good you've done
will soon get swept away
You've begun
to matter more
Than the things you say
Listen, Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that
you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right-hand man
all along
You have set them all
on fire
They think they've found
the new messiah
And they'll hurt you
when they find they're wrong
I remember when
this whole thing began
No talk of God then
We called you a man
And believe me
My admiration for you
hasn't died
But every word
you say today
Gets twisted 'round
some other way
And they'll hurt you
if they think you've lied
Nazareth, your famous son
should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood
he'd have made good
Tables, chairs and oaken chests
would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm
Listen, Jesus
Do you care for your race
Don't you see
we must keep in our place
We are occupied
Have you forgotten
how put down we are
I am frightened
by the crowd
For we are getting
much too loud
And they'll crush us
if we go too far
lf we go
Too far
Listen, Jesus
to the warning I give
Please remember
that I want us to live
But it's sad
to see our chances
Weakening with every hour
Your followers are blind
Too much heaven
on their minds
It was beautiful
but now it's sour
Yes, it's all
Gone sour
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Listen, Jesus
to the warning I give
Please remember
that I want us to live
So come on, come on
He won't listen to me
Ah, Ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh
Come on, listen
Listen to me
Come on
and listen to me
Ah, Ahh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Come on
Listen to me
Come on, listen
Listen to me
Ah-ah-ahh
Ohh, oh-oh-ohh
Come on
Listen to me
Listen to me

Don't you try

Save tomorrow

Tell me what's a-happenin'
- What's the buzz
Tell me what's a-happening
- I could give you
- Facts and figures
- What's the buzz
Tell me what's a-happenin'
- Even give you plans and forecasts
- When do we ride to Jerusalem
- Even tell you where I'm goin'
- When do we ride to Jerusalem
When do we ride to Jerusalem
When do we ride to Jerusalem
When do we ride to Jerusalem
When do we ride to Jerusalem
Why should you
want to know
Why are you obsessed
with fighting
Times and fates
you can't defy
lf you knew
the path we're riding
You'd understand it
less than I
What's the buzz
Tell me what's a-happenin'
What's the buzz
Tell me what's a-happenin'

Let me try to cool down

Let me try to cool down your face
Oh, let me try
Let me try
To cool down your face
Let me try to cool down
your face a bit
Mary, mmm, that is good
While you prattle

Where and when
and who and how
She alone
is trying to give me
What I need

It seems to me
a strange thing
Mystifying
That a man like you
can waste his time
On women of her kind
Hey, cool it, man.
Yes, I can understand that
She amuses
But to let her kiss you
and stroke your hair
That's hardly
in your line
It's not that I object
to her profession
But she doesn't fit in well
with what you teach and say
It doesn't help us
if you're inconsistent
They only need
a small excuse
To put us all away
Who are you
to criticize her
Who are you
to despise her
Leave her, Leave her
Let her be now
Leave her, Leave her
She's with me now
lf your slate is clean
then you can throw stones
lf your slate is not
then leave her alone
- Hey, Jesus, what do we say ?

I'm amazed
that men like you
Can be so shallow
thick and slow
There is not a man among you
who knows or cares if I come or go
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong
How can you say that
How can you say that
How can you say that
How can you say that
Not one.
Not one of you !
We've been sitting on the fence
for far too long
Why let him
upset us
Caiaphas, let him be
All those imbeciles
will see
He really
doesn't matter
Jesus is important
We've let him
go his way before
And while he starts
a major war
We theorize
and chatter
He's just another
Scripture-thumping hack from Galilee
The difference is
they call him King
The difference
frightens me
What about the Romans ?
When they see
King Jesus crowned
Do you think
they'll stand around
Cheering and applauding
What about our people
lf they see
we've lost our nerve
Don't you think
that they deserve
Something more rewarding
They've got
what they want
They think so anyway
lf he's what they want
Why take
their toy away
He's a craze
Put yourself in my place
I can hardly step aside
Cannot let my hands
be tied
I am law and order
What about our priesthood
Don't you see
that we could fall
lf we are to last
at all
We cannot be divided
Then say so
to the Council
But don't rely
on subtlety
Frighten them
or they won't see
Then we are decided
Then we are decided.
Try not to get worried
Try not to turn onto
Problems that upset you
Don't you know
everything's all right
Yes, everything's fine
And we want you
to sleep well tonight
Let the world turn
without you tonight
lf we try, we'll get by
so forget all about us
- Tonight
- Everything's all right, yes
Everything's
all right, yes
Sleep and I shall soothe you
calm you and anoint you
- Myrrh for your hot forehead
- Ah
Then you'll feel
everything's all right
Yes, everything's fine
And it's cool and
the ointment's sweet
For the fire
in your head and feet
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
And relax
Think of nothing
- Tonight
- Everything's all right, yes
- Everything's all right, yes
- Hey, hey, woman
Your fine ointment
brand-new and expensive
Should have been saved
for the poor
Why has it been wasted
We could have raised maybe
Three hundred
silver pieces or more
People who are hungry
People who are starving
They matter more
than your
Feet and hair
Try not to get worried
Try not to turn onto
- Problems that upset you
- Oh
- Don't you know
everything's all right
- All right, yes
- Everything's all right, yes
- Surely you're not saying
We have the resources
To save the poor
from their lot
There will be poor always
pathetically struggling
Look at the good things
you've got
Think while
you still have me
Move while
you still see me
You'll be lost
and you'll be sorry
When I'm gone
Sleep and I shall soothe you
calm you and anoint you
- Myrrh for your hot forehead
- Oh
Then you'll feel
everything's all right, yes
Everything's fine and it's cool
and the ointment's sweet
For the fire
in your head and feet
Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Think of nothing tonight
- Tonight close your eyes and relax
- Think of nothing
- Close your eyes, Close your eyes
- And relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
Everything's all right, yes
Everything's all right
Good Caiaphas
The Council
waits for you
The Pharisees
And priests
are here for you
Ah, gentlemen
You know
why we are here
We've not much time
And quite
a problem here
Hosanna, Superstar
Hosanna
Superstar
Hosanna, Superstar
Hosanna
Superstar
Listen to
that howling mob
Of blockheads
in the street
A trick or two
with lepers
And the whole town's
on its feet
He is dangerous
Jesus Christ
Superstar
He is dangerous
Tell us that you're
who they say you are
That man is in town right now
to whip up some support
A rabble-rousing mission
that I think we must abort
He is dangerous
Jesus Christ
Superstar
He is dangerous

Look, Caiaphas
They're right outside our yard
Quick, Caiaphas
Go call the Roman guard
No, wait
We need a more permanent solution
to our problem
What then to do
about Jesus of Nazareth
Miracle wonderman
hero of fools
No riots, no army
no fighting, no slogans
One thing I'll say for him
Jesus is cool
We cannot leave him
to his own devices
His half-witted fans
will get out of control
- How can we stop him
- His glamour increases
- By leaps every minute
- He's top of the pole
I see
bad things arising
The crowd crowned him king
which the Romans would ban
I see
blood and destruction
Our elimination
because of one man
Blood and destruction
because of one man
Because, because, because of one man
Our elimination
because of one man
Because, because
because of one
Cause of one
cause of one man
[ Priest ] What then to do
about this Jesus mania
[ Annas ] Oh, how do we deal
with the carpenter-king
[ Priest ] Where do we start
with a man who is bigger
Than John was when John did
his baptism thing
Fools, you have
no perception
The stakes we are gambling
are frighteningly high
We must crush him
completely
So like John before him
this Jesus must die
For the sake of the nation
this Jesus must die
[ All ] Must die, Must die
This Jesus must die
So like John before him
this Jesus must die
Must die, Must die
This Jesus must, Jesus must
Jesus must die

Hosanna, Heysanna
Sanna, sanna, ho
Sanna, heysanna
hosanna
Hey, J.C., J.C.
Won't you smile at me
Sanna, hosanna
Hey, superstar
Tell the rabble
to be quiet
We anticipate a riot
This common crowd
ls much too loud
Tell the mob
who sing your song
That they are fools
and they are wrong
They are a curse
They should disperse
Hosanna, heysanna
Sanna, sanna, ho
Sanna, heysanna
hosanna
Hey, J.C., J.C.
You're all right by me
Sanna, hosanna
Hey, superstar
Why waste your breath
moaning at the crowd
Nothing can be done
to stop the shouting
lf every tongue
were still
The noise
would still continue
The rocks and stones
themselves
Would start to sing
Hosanna, heysanna
sanna, sanna, ho
Sanna, heysanna
hosanna
Hey, J.C., J.C.
won't you fight for me
Sanna, hosanna
Hey, superstar
Sing me your songs
but not for me alone
Sing out for yourselves...
For you are blessed
There is not one of you
who cannot win the Kingdom
The slow, the suffering
The quick, the dead
Hosanna, heysanna
sanna, sanna, ho
Sanna, heysanna
hosanna
Hey, J.C., J.C.
would you die for me
Sanna, hosanna
Hey, superstar
Jesus ! Jesus !
Christ, you know I love you
Did you see I waved
I believe in you and God
so tell me that I'm saved
Christ, you know I love you
Did you see I waved
I believe in you and God
so tell me that I'm saved
Jesus, I am with you
Touch me, Touch me, Jesus
Jesus, I am on your side
Kiss me, Kiss me, Jesus
Christ, what more do you need
to convince you
That you've made it
and you're easily as strong
As the filth from Rome
who rape our country
And who've terrorized
our people for so long

Jesus, I am with you
Touch me, Touch me, Jesus
Jesus, I am on your side
Kiss me, Kiss me, Jesus
Christ, you know I love you
Did you see I waved
I believe in you and God
so tell me that I'm saved
Christ, you know I love you
Did you see I waved
I believe in you and God
so tell me that I'm saved
Christ, you know I love you
Did you see I waved
I believe in you and God
so tell me that I'm saved
Christ, you know I love you
Did you see I waved
I believe in you and God
so tell me that I'm saved
Jesus, I am with you
Touch me, Touch me, Jesus
Jesus, I am on your side
Kiss me, Kiss me, Jesus
- There must be over 50,000
- 50,000
- Screamin' love and more for you
- Love, love, love
And every one
of 50,000
- Would do whatever ya asked them to
- Messiah
Keep them yellin'
their devotion
But add a touch
of hate at Rome
You will rise
to greater power
We will win ourselves
a home

- You

Oh
Forever
Amen
A... ha-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah
...men
Neither you, Simon
Nor the 50,000
Nor the Romans
nor the Jews
Nor Judas
nor the twelve
Nor the priests
nor the scribes
Nor doomed Jerusalem
itself
Understand
what power is
Understand
what glory is
Understand at all
Understand
at all
lf you knew
All that I knew
My poor Jerusalem
You'd see the truth
But you'd close your eyes
But you'd close
your eyes
While you live
Your troubles are many
Poor Jerusalem
To conquer death
You only have to die
You only have
to die
I dreamed
I met a Galilean
A most amazing man
He had that look
you very rarely find
The haunting, hunted kind
I asked him to say
what had happened
How it all began
I asked again
He never said a word
As if he hadn't heard
And next
the room was full
Of wild and angry men
They seemed
to hate this man
They fell on him and then
Disappeared again
Then I saw
thousands of millions
Crying for this man
And then I heard them
mentioning my name
And leaving me
the blame
Pilate

Roll on up, Jerusalem
Come on in, Jerusalem
Sunday, here we go again
Live in me, Jerusalem
Here you live, Jerusalem
Here you breathe, Jerusalem
While your temple still survives
you at least are still alive
I got things you won't believe
Name your pleasure, I will sell
I can fix your wildest needs
I got heaven, I got hell
Roll on up for my price is down
Come on in for the best in town
Take your pick of the finest wine
Lay your bets on this bird of mine
What you see
is what you get
No one's been
disappointed yet
Don't be scared
Give me a try
There is nothing
you can't buy
Name your price, I got everything
Hurry, It's all going fast
Borrow cash
on the finest terms
Hurry now
while stocks still last

Roll on up, Jerusalem
Come on in, Jerusalem
Sunday, here we go again
Live in me, Jerusalem
Here you live, Jerusalem
Here you breathe, Jerusalem
While your temple still survives
you at least are still alive
I got things you won't believe
Name your pleasure, I will sell


My temple
should be
A house of prayer
But you have made it
A den of thieves
Get out !
Get out !

My time
ls almost through
Little left to do
After all, I've tried
for three years
Seems like 30
Feels like 30
See my eyes
I can hardly see
See me stand
I can hardly walk
I believe
you can make me whole
See my tongue
I can hardly talk
See my skin
I'm a mass of blood
See my legs
I can hardly stand
I believe
you can make me well
See my purse
I'm a poor, poor man
[ All ] Will you touch
Will you mend me, Christ
Won't you touch
Won't you heal me, Christ
Will you kiss
You can cure me, Christ
Won't you kiss
Won't you pay me, Christ
See my eyes
I can hardly see
See me stand
I can hardly walk
I believe
you can make me whole
See my tongue
I can hardly talk
See my skin
I'm a mass of blood
See my legs
I can hardly stand
I believe
you can make me well
See my purse
I'm a poor, poor man
Will you touch
Will you mend me, Christ
Won't you touch
Will you heal me, Christ
Will you kiss
You can cure me, Christ
Won't you kiss
Won't you pay me, Christ
See my eyes
I can hardly see
See me stand
I can hardly walk
I believe
you can make me whole
See my tongue
I can hardly talk
See my skin
I'm a mass of blood
See my legs
I can hardly stand
I believe
you can make me well
See my purse
I'm a poor, poor man
Will you touch

Won't you touch

You can cure me, Christ
Won't you kiss

See my eyes

I believe you can make me whole
See my tongue I can hardly talk

- There's too many of you !
- I believe you can make me well
- Don't push me !
- See my purse, I'm a poor, poor man
- Will you touch
Will you mend me, Christ
- There's too little of me.
- Will you kiss
You can cure me, Christ
- Don't crowd me !
See my eyes
I can hardly see
- Leave me alone !
- I believe you can make me whole
See my tongue
I can hardly talk
Jesus !
Touch me, Jesus !
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
And forget
all about us
Tonight
I don't know
how to love him
What to do
How to move him
I've been changed
Yes, really changed
ln these past few days
when I've seen myself
I seem like someone else
I don't know how
to take this
I don't see
why he moves me
He's a man
He's just a man
And I've had
so many men before
ln very many ways
He's just one more
Should I bring him down
Should I scream and shout
Should I speak of love
Let my feelings out
I never thought
I'd come to this
What's it all about
Don't ya think
it's rather funny
I should be
in this position
I'm the one
who's always been
So calm, so cool
No lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so
I never thought
I'd come to this
What's it all about
Yet if he said
he loved me
I'd be lost
I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope
Just couldn't cope
I'd turn my head
I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so
I want him so
I love him
So

Now if I help you
it matters that you see
These sordid kind of things
are coming hard to me
It's taken me some time
to work out what to do
I weighed the whole thing out
before I came to you
I have no thought at all
about my own reward
I really didn't come here
of my own accord
Just don't say I'm
Damned for all time
I came because I had to
I'm the one who saw
Jesus can't control it
like he did before
Furthermore, I know
that Jesus thinks so too
Jesus wouldn't mind
that I was here with you
I have no thought at all
about my own reward
I really didn't come here
of my own accord
Just don't say I'm
Damned for all time
Annas, you're a friend
a worldly man and wise
Caiaphas, my friend
I know you sympathize
Why are we the prophets
Why are we the ones
We see the sad solution
Know what must be done
I have no thought at all
about my own reward
I really didn't come here
of my own accord
Just don't say I'm
Damned
For all time
Cut the protesting
Forget the excuses
We want information
Get up off the floor
We have the papers
we need to arrest him
You know his movements
We know the law
Your help in this matter
won't go unrewarded
We'll pay you in silver
cash on the nail
We just need to know
where the soldiers can find him
- With no crowd 'round him
- Then we can't fail
I don't want
your blood money
Oh, that doesn't matter
Our expenses are good
I don't need
your blood money
But you might as well take it
We think that you should
Think of the things
you can do with that money
Choose any charity
Give to the poor
We've noted your motives
We've noted your feelings
This isn't blood money
It's a--
- A fee.
- A fee, nothing more
On Thursday night
You'll find him
where you want him
Far from the crowds
ln the Garden
Of Gethsemane
So long, Judas
So long, Judas

Look at all my trials
and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool
of wine
Don't disturb me now
I can see the answers
Till this evening
is this morning
Life is fine
Always hoped that
I'd be an apostle
Knew that I would
make it if I tried
Then when we retire
We can write
the Gospels
So they'll still talk about us
when we've died
The end
ls just a little harder
When brought about
By friends
For all you care
This wine
could be my blood
For all you care
This bread
Could be my body
The end.
This is my blood
you drink
This is my body you eat
lf you would, remember me
When you eat and drink
I must be mad
thinking I'll be remembered
Yes, I must be
out of my head
Look at your blank faces
My name will mean nothing
Ten minutes
after I'm dead
One of you denies me
One of you betrays me
No ! No !

Peter will deny me
- No, not me !
- ln just a few hours
Three times will deny me
And that's not all I see
One of you here dining
One of my 12 chosen
Will leave to betray me
Cut out the dramatics
You know very well who
- Why don't you go do it ?
- You want me to do it ?
- Hurry, they are waiting
- lf you knew why I do it
I don't care
why you do it
To think I admired you
Well, now I despise you
- You liar, you Judas
- You wanted me to do it
What if I just stayed here
and ruined your ambition
Christ, you deserve it
Hurry, you fool
Hurry and go
Save me your speeches
I don't want to know
Go, Go
Look at all my trials
and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool
of wine
What's that in the bread
It's gone to my head
Till this morning
is this evening
Life is fine
Always hoped that
I'd be an apostle
Knew that I would make it
if I tried
Then when we retire
we can write the Gospels
So they'll all talk about us
when we've died
You sad
pathetic man
See where you
brought us to
Our ideals die around us
and all because of you
But the saddest cut of all
Someone had to turn you in
Like a common criminal
Like a wounded animal
A jaded mandarin
A jaded mandarin
Like a jaded, faded
faded, jaded, jaded mandarin
Get out
They're waiting
Get out
They're waiting
Oh, they're waiting for you
Every time I look at you
I don't understand
Why you let the things you did
get so out of hand
You'd have managed better
if you'd had it planned
A-a-a-ah

Always hoped that
I'd be an apostle
Knew that I would make it
if I tried
lf I tried
lf I tried
Then when we retire
we can write the Gospels
So they'll still
talk about us
When we've died
Will no one stay awake
with me
Peter, John, James
Will none of you wait
with me
Peter
John
James
I only want to say
lf there is a way
Take this cup
away from me
For I don't want
to taste its poison
Feel it burn me
I have changed
I'm not as sure
as when we started
Then, I was inspired
Now
I'm sad and tired
Listen
Surely I've exceeded
expectations
Tried for three years
Seems like 30
Could You ask as much
From any other man
But if I die
See the saga through
And do the things
You ask of me
Let them hate me
hit me, hurt me
Nail me
to their tree
I'd want to know
I'd want to know, my God
I'd want to know
I'd want to know, my God
I'd want to see
I'd want to see, my God
I'd want to see
I'd want to see, my God
Why I
Should die
Would I be more noticed
than I ever was before
Would the things
I've said and done
Matter any more
I'd have to know
I'd have to know, my Lord
I'd have to know
I'd have to know, my Lord
I'd have to see
I'd have to see, my Lord
I'd have to see
I'd have to see, my Lord
lf I die
what will be my reward
lf I die
what will be my reward
Have to know
I'd have to know, my Lord
Have to know
I'd have to know, my Lord
Why
Why should I die
Oh, why should I die
Can You show me now
That I would not be
killed in vain
Show me just a little
Of Your omnipresent brain
Show me there's a reason
for Your wanting me to die
You're far too keen
on where and how
But not so hot on why
All right
I'll die
Oh, Oh
Just watch me die
See how
See how I'll die
Oh-h-h
Just watch me die
Then
I was inspired
Now
I'm sad and tired.
After all
I've tried for three years.
Seems like 90.
Why then am I scared
to finish
What I started
What You started
I didn't start it.
God
Thy will is hard
But You hold every card
I will drink
Your cup of poison
Nail me to Your cross
And break me
Bleed me
Beat me, Kill me
Take me now
Before I change my mind
Judas,
must you betray me...
With a kiss
What's the buzz
Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz
Tell me what's happenin'
What's happenin'
What's the buzz
Tell me what's a-happenin'
What's the buzz
Tell me what's a-happenin'
What's the buzz
Tell me what's a-happenin'
What's the buzz
Tell me what's a-happenin'
Hang on, Lord
We're gonna fight for you
- Hang on, Lord
We're gonna fight for you
- Hang on, Lord
Hang on, Lord
We're gonna fight for you
- Hang on, Lord
We're gonna fight for you
- We're gonna fight for you
Put away your sword
Don't you know
that it's all over
It was nice, but
Now it's gone
Why are you obsessed
with fighting
Stick to fishing
from now on


Tell me, Christ
how you feel tonight
Do you plan
to put up a fight
Do you feel that
you've had the breaks
What would you say
were your big mistakes
Do you think that
you may retire
Did you think
you would get much higher
How do you view
your coming trial
Have your men proved
it's all worthwhile
Come with us
to see Caiaphas
You'll just love
the high priest's house
You'll just love
seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die
in the high priest's house
Come on, God
This is not like you
Let us know
what you're gonna do
You know what
your supporters feel
You'll escape
in the final reel
Tell me, Christ
how you feel tonight
Do you plan
to put up a fight
Do you feel that
you had the breaks
What would you say
were your big mistakes
Come with us
to see Caiaphas
You'll just love
the high priest's house
You'll just love
seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die
in the high priest's house
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him now
We have got him now
Jesus, you must realize
The serious charges
facing you
You say you're the Son of God
in all your handouts
Well, is it true
That's what you say
You say that I am
There you have it, gentlemen
What more evidence do we need
Judas, thank you
for the victim
Stay a while
You'll see it bleed
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Take him to Pilate
Take him to Pilate
Take him to Pilate
Take him to Pilate
I think I've
seen you somewhere
I remember.
You were with that man
they took away
I recognize
your face
You've got
the wrong man, lady
I don't know him
And I wasn't where
he was tonight
Never near the place
That's strange for I am sure
I saw you with him
You were right by his side
and yet you denied
I tell you
I was never, ever with him
But I saw you too.
He looked just like you.
I don't know him !
Peter, don't you know
what you have said
You've gone
and cut him dead
I had to do it
Don't you see
Or else
they'd go for me
It's what he told us
you would do
I wonder
how he knew


- Come on. Come on.
- There he is, see? Hurry. Come on.
Who is
This broken man
Cluttering up
My hallway
Who is this unfortunate
Someone Christ
King of the Jews
Oh. So this is
Jesus Christ.
I am really
quite surprised
You look so small.
Not a king at all.
We all know
that you are news
But are you King ?
King of the Jews
Your words, not mine.
What do
You mean by that
That is not an answer
You're deep
ln trouble, friend
Someone Christ
King of the Jews
How can someone
in your state
Be so cool
about his fate
An amazing thing,
this silent king.
Since you come
from Galilee
Then you need not
come to me
You're Herod's race.
You're Herod's case.
Hey, hosanna
Heysanna
Sanna
sanna ho
Sanna, heysanna, ho
and how
Hey, J.C., J.C.
Please explain to me
You had everything
Where is it now
Jesus, I am overjoyed...
To meet you face to face
You've been getting
quite a name...
All around the place
Healing cripples
- Ooh.
- Raising from the dead

Now I understand
you're God
Hmm ? Huh ?
Mmm.
At least that's
what you've said
So
You are the Christ
You're the great Jesus Christ
Prove to me
that you're divine
Change my water
into wine
That's all you need do
Then I'll know it's all true
Come on
King of the Jews
Jesus, you just won't believe the hit
you've made around here
You are all we talk about
You're the wonder of the year
Oh, what a pity
if it's all a lie
Still I'm sure that you can rock
the cynics if you try
So if you are the Christ
Yes, the great Jesus Christ
Prove to me that
you're no fool
Walk across
my swimming pool
- lf you do that for me
- Whoo !
- Then I'll let you go free
- Whoo !
Come on
King of the Jews
I only ask what I'd ask
any superstar
What is it that you have got
that puts you where you are
Oh-ho-ho
I am waiting
Yes, I'm a captive fan
I'm dying to be shown that
you are not just any man
I'm dying to be shown that
you are not just any man
So if you are the Christ
Yes, the great Jesus Christ
Feed my household
with this bread
You can do it
on your head
Uh, or has something gone wrong ?
Jesus, why do you take so long ?
Aw, come on,
King of the Jews !
Hey, aren't you
Scared of me, Christ
Mister wonderful Christ
Aaah !
You're a joke !
You're not the Lord.
You're nothing but a fraud.
Take him away
He's got nothing to say
Get out,
you King of the--
Get out, King of the-- Oh !
Get out, you King of the Jews !
Get out of here !
You-- You--
Get out of here, you !
Get out of my life !
I've been living
to see you
Dying to see you
but it shouldn't be like this
This was unexpected
What do I do now
Could we start again
please
I've been very hopeful
so far
Now for the first time
I think we're going wrong
Hurry up and tell me
This is just a dream
Or could we start again
please
I think you've made
your point now
You've even gone a bit too far to get
the message home
Before it gets
too frightening
We ought to call
a halt
So could we start again
please
I've been living
to see you
Dying to see you
but it shouldn't be like this
This was unexpected
What do I do now
Could we start again
please
Could we start again
please
I think you've made
your point now
You've even gone a bit too far to get

So could we start again please
Could we start again
please
Could we start again
please
Could we start again
please
Could we start again
please
Could we start again
Could we start again
My God
I saw him
He looked three-quarters dead and
he was so bad I had to turn my head
You beat him so hard
that he was bent and lame
And I know who
everybody's gonna blame
I don't believe he knows
I acted for our good
I'd save him all this suffering
if I could
Don't believe
Our good
And I'd save him
if I could
Cut the confessions
Forget the excuses
I don't understand why
you're filled with remorse
All that you've said has
come true with a vengeance
The mob turned against him
You backed the right horse
What you have done will be
the saving of everyone
You'll be remembered
forever for this
And not only that
You've been paid for your efforts
Pretty good wages
for one little kiss
Christ, I know
you can't hear me
But I only did
what you wanted me to
Christ, I'd sell out
the nation
For I have been saddled
with the murder of you
I have been spattered
with innocent blood
I shall be dragged through
the slime and the mud
I have been spattered
with innocent blood
I shall be dragged through the slime
and the slime and the
Slime and the mud
I
Don't know how
to love him
I don't know
why he moves me
He's a man
He's just a man
He is not a king
He's just the same
As anyone I know
He scares me so
When he's cold and dead
Will he let me be
Does he love
Does he love me too
Does he care for me
My mind is--
It's in darkness.
God. God, I'm sick !
I've been used !
And You knew
all the time !
God-- God, I will never know
why You chose me...
for Your crime !
For Your bloody crime !
You have murdered me !
Mur-- Murdered me !
Murdered me ! Murdered me !
Murdered me ! Murdered me !
Murdered me ! Murdered-- !
So long, Judas
So long, Judas
So long, Judas
And so, the king
is once again my guest
And why is this
Was Herod unimpressed
We turn to Rome
To sentence Nazareth
We have no law
To put a man to death
We need him crucified
It's all
you have to do
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do
Talk to me, Jesus Christ
You have been brought here
Manacled, beaten,
by your own people.
Do you have the first idea
why you deserve it ?
Listen, King of the Jews
Where is your kingdom
Look at me
Am I a Jew
I have no kingdom.
In this world,
I'm through.
- Talk to me, Jesus Christ
- There may be a kingdom...
for me somewhere.
If you only knew.
- Then you are a king.
- It's you that say I am
I look for truth
and find that I get damned
And what is truth
ls truth unchanging law
We both have truths
Are mine the same as yours
Crucify him ! Crucify him !
What do you mean ?
You'd crucify your king ?
We have no king but Caesar
He's done no wrong.
No, not the slightest thing.
We have no king but Caesar
Crucify him
Well, this is new.
Respect for Caesar !
Until now, this has been
noticeably lacking.
Who is this Jesus ?
Why is he different ?
You Jews produce messiahs
by the sackful.
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do
Talk to me
Jesus Christ
Look at
your Jesus Christ
I'll agree
he's mad
Ought to be locked up
But that is not a reason
to destroy him
He's a sad little man
not a king or god
Not a thief
I need a crime
Crucify him ! Crucify him !
Crucify him !
Crucify him !
Behold the man
Behold your shattered king
We have no king
but Caesar
You hypocrites
You hate us more than him
We have no king but Caesar
Crucify him
I see no reason
I find no evil
This man is harmless
so why does he upset you
He's just misguided
Thinks he's important
But to keep you vultures happy,
I shall flog him !
Crucify him ! Crucify him !
Crucify him !
Crucify !
Crucify ! Crucify !
Crucify him ! Crucify him !
Crucify ! Crucify ! Crucify !
Crucify ! Crucify him !
Crucify him !
Crucify ! Crucify !
Crucify ! Crucify !

Where are you from Jesus
What do you want
Jesus
Tell me
You've got to be careful
You could be dead soon
Could well be
Why do you not speak
When I hold your life
in my hands
How can you
stay quiet
I don't believe
you understand
You have nothing
in your hands
Any power you have...
comes to you
from far beyond.
Everything is fixed,
and you can't change it.
You're a fool,
Jesus Christ !
- How can I help you
- [ Crowd ] Pilate, crucify him
Crucify
Remember Caesar
You have a duty
to keep the peace
So crucify him
Remember Caesar
You'll be demoted
You'll be deported
Crucify him
Remember Caesar
You have a duty
To keep the peace
so crucify him
Remember Caesar
You'll be demoted
You'll be deported
Crucify him

You have a duty
To keep the peace

Remember Caesar
You'll be demoted
You'll be deported
Crucify him
Don't let me stop
Your great
self-destruction
Die if you want to
You misguided martyr
I wash my hands
Of your demolition
Die if you want to
You innocent puppet


Mmm, every time I look at you
I don't understand
Why you let the things you did
get so out of hand
You'd have managed better
if you'd had it planned
Now why'd you choose such a backward
time and such a strange land
lf you'd come today you could
have reached the whole nation
lsrael in 4 B.C. had
no mass communication

Jesus Christ Superstar
Do you think you're
what they say you are
Tell me
What you think about
your friends at the top
Now who'd you think besides yourself
was the pick of the crop
Buddha, was he where it's at
ls he where you are
Could Mohammed move a mountain
or was that just P.R.
Did you mean to die like that
Was that a mistake or
Did you know your messy death
would be a record breaker

my spirit.
