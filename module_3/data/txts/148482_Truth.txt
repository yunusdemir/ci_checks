Please start from the beginning.
I created an app and
put it up for download.
It targets my ex-employer.
Your request is denied.
Your client must comply immediately.
I'm the only one who knows
how to take down this app,
and I'm not gonna do it.
But you should know that that issue
in Millwood, I've been cleared.
They're dropping
the charges against David.
<i>Guys like David get off with nothing!</i>
- He's gonna get what's coming to him.
- Get this letter to Taylor.
- I don't know where she is.
- Yes, you do.
He asked me to give this to you,
but I can't make you read it.
<i>I'm just heading home.</i>
We'll walk with you.
That's why Bear Clan's out here.
Hey, brother!
- Shane.
- I'm back.
<i>Those lawyers today,
they were from Lovand.</i>
Let's just dump all
this on the sidewalk,
and pretend we never got this case.
We're his lawyers.
Once we say we're in, we're in.
They'll kill anyone
who learns about their secret.
Me and now you.
<i>Drop the case. You have been warned.</i>
- What took you so long?
- I got here as soon as I could.
What are you doing, man?
I'm protecting myself, which is
what you should be doing too.
- I'm not gonna get a gun!
- I'm not taking any chances!
Dude, come on.
- I can't do this anymore!
- Come on, man!
No! OK? I'm out!
- You need to try and calm down.
- Calm down?
They're destroying my life, Noah.
I know, I know,
but we are going to get
through this together.
You just gotta do me a favour
Put that down, man.
You are freaking me out.
Thank you.
Look...
...I need you.
The movement needs you.
- Screw the movement!
- No. No.
The only reason that they're
playing dirty is because
we have them on the ropes.
The app is up and it's working.
We need to finish what we started.
"Whatever it takes,"
remember?
You're right.
Yeah?
Whatever it takes.
Yes. OK.
That is what I like to hear, man.
Look, I-I-I gotta go now but, um...
we got this, OK?
So someone broke into your car?
- While I was still driving it.
- So, like a carjacking?
Not exactly. They were not in the car;
they gained control of it remotely.
I was still behind the wheel,
but I was powerless.
That must have been terrifying.
And then they threatened me
through my In-Car system.
I know how crazy I must sound.
I don't think that.
What you're reporting
here is a serious offence.
The threat, what was said exactly?
I can't tell you that. It'd be
breaking client privilege.
So this is connected to a case?
- What can you tell me about it?
- I can't.
So you know who did this?
I can't. I'm sorry, this was obviously
- a mistake. I'm sorry.
- No, if you were threatened,
you need to file a report.
Just hold on, OK?
I'll give you my card.
When you're ready to contact...
Oh, Captain, my Captain?
I made coffee.
I hope it's not too strong.
- How did you sleep?
- I didn't.
Country air, sound of the river...
it's more like being in a coma.
- You hate my coffee?
- I haven't even tried it yet.
Try it.
- It's not coffee, it's beer.
- Not just any beer.
That is what you call Millbrew.
- Sorry?
- Bragg Creek.
Flathead Lake, Creemore;
what do all of these
crappy-ass towns have in common?
They were all revitalized,
nay, reinvented...
- Did you just say "nay"?
- By beer.
By a local brewery to be more specific.
Time to add Millwood to the list.
- What's this?
- My plan to start
a microbrewery right here, in Millwood.
A microbrew brings tourists.
Some nice restaurants
start to pop up. Next thing you know,
town's hopping again. I've
actually done a ton of research.
and it's pretty sound.
I've even got investors
coming to talk this afternoon.
You got an article about me in here.
Yeah. I don't know
if you know, but what you did
around here was a pretty big deal.
I'm proud of you, man.
Besides, she's a total smoke show.
I'd keep that one in the spank bank.
Crawford. Joanna?
OK, that's just eerie.
If you build it...
Why aren't you using your phone?
It's a long story I
won't bore you with.
I'm sure you're busy.
Yeah.
<i>I didn't know who else to call.</i>
- What's going on?
- This case I'm working...
- <i>What case?</i>
- This hacktivist kid,
he's being sued by a private
military contractor.
- Yeah, I read about that.
- <i>It went kind of sideways.</i>
Is that why you're not
using your phone?
- You know I can't tell you that.
- <i>Look, if you're in danger,</i>
- privilege goes out the window.
- <i>I'm fine.</i>
I'll be fine.
That private security firm
you dealt with in town...
Alright, now you're starting
to freak me out.
Billy, can you get them to call me?
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
<i>Hey,</i>
be careful.
Bye, Billy.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I got the Lovand employee records,
contractors, subcontractors
dating back 15 years
just like you asked.
- Thanks, Sunil.
- Lift with your knees.
I mean, I... No, I can
put it down wherever.
OK, I don't care.
I don't care. I don't care.
- The answer is still no.
- Tough client?
Ah, the toughest! My 11 year old
wants to pierce her belly button.
Sorry I'm in late. Car trouble.
This isn't a CTS, Joanna.
No one's looking over your shoulder.
- Is everything alright?
- Yeah. I think.
My car got tampered with last night.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I think it has something to do
with our new case.
Intimidation tactics?
- It's nothing I can't handle.
- Good
because this could be
a big case for us.
This is a public figure;
this guy could take
us to the next level.
- With your help of course.
- Of course.
I will be in my office going
over this tome if you need me.
Joanna, to belly or not
to belly? That is the question.
I feel like I could make a
compelling argument for both sides.
- Of course you could.
- I will get my sister's
expert opinion for you.
What kind of lesbians
are you guys anyway?
Apparently the kind that doesn't
know how to fix a television.
Might be the only useful thing
that my father ever taught me.
Hey, it's more than I can say for mine.
I heard about the
charges being dropped.
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.
Different rules apply
for rich white guys, I guess.
Thanks for doing this, Tay.
You know I can't live
without my videogames.
Honestly, when you called,
I was just happy to
have something to do.
Taking it easy is kind
of driving me nuts.
I wish my girlfriend had that problem.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- University applications
are due in less than a week,
and she still thinks
- she's not going.
- "She" is
sitting right here.
I know.
I'm just not spending
another year away from you.
Montreal sounds awesome.
I wish I could come with you guys.
Sounds like somebody wants
to kiss some French boys.
Actually,
if my dad has his way,
I'll be coming home any day now.
- What is that?
- That's a letter from him.
He sent it up with your uncle Billy.
- And...?
- I don't know.
I haven't read it yet.
You think I should?
- Burn it.
- Absolutely.
Thanks a lot!
I'm just not sure that I'm ready
to hear his side of things.
Deadbeat dads, we should just
abolish them all from the planet.
Oh! Also, we have no food
in the cupboards,
so I need to grab some takeout
before orientation.
The Bear Clan thing,
I told you about it.
- Right. Yeah. I remember.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, hey, I got it!
- Yes! Taylor, you're a genius!
- I love you.
- I love you more.
_
_
Only one thing puts a smile
on your face like that.
- How's she doing?
- She's great.
She's on her way to volunteer
with the Bear Clan.
It's our girl.
Actually came to talk to you though.
How are you doing
with all this Hanley business?
Luna can't believe he
just gets away with it
- just like she said he would.
- Joanna?
She knows the law, I guess.
Yeah, well, there's legal justice
and there's actual justice.
I won't stop until I get that.
If the Crown doesn't think
there's a case then...
Fine. They won't send him to jail;
I'll send him to the bank.
Are you talking about civil action?
Money's the only thing
he cares about anyway.
Now, I'll hire myself a good lawyer.
- Crawford.
- Pff!
No. Billy's too close to this.
Lawsuits can get expensive;
you have money for that?
- Still working that part out.
- Hey.
Look, this is all still so fresh.
You remember when my mom died?
You told me not to make
any big life decisions
- for at least six months.
- Except David Hanley
is not dead. He's alive,
and he's walking around
like he's made out of Teflon.
I just can't live with that.
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yeah, put a bullet in him.
I'm kidding.
Sort of.
You have a good day now, Owen.
You too.
Do you have any cayenne?
I want to create an IPA
with a little kick.
I like to play with the recipes.
I'm an artist, bro,
- you know that.
- Yeah, and I'm a lawyer
- with an MBA.
- Which is why we're the perfect team.
- I reviewed your business model.
- Exciting, no?
Shane, your floorplan
is drawn on a cocktail napkin.
They're... preliminary renderings.
I just think if you're
asking people for money...
I'm not asking you for money.
I didn't say that.
This microbrewery
is a really good idea.
- Thank you.
- But with money people,
you have one chance to put
your best foot forward.
- I think you should push the meeting.
- No way.
Just 'til you're a little
more prepared to go in there.
No. The window is open.
We have to move on this now!
Please, don't be
a buzzkill on this, Billy.
Look, you did an amazing thing
for this town.
I never have. Not one good thing
in my whole life.
We can bring this town
back to life, bro.
Together.
What time are you
meeting these investors?
Yes! Yes!
- Hello?
<i>- Is this Joanna Chang?</i>
- Who is this?
- <i>I'm a friend of Billy's.</i>
- Half-day, Boss?
- Something came up.
I gotta go meet a client.
Jared Lapinski,
He's an analyst Lovand hired
on their military projects.
Do some digging for me?
- On it like a bonnet.
- Thanks. I won't be long.
- You didn't have trouble finding me?
- Just used my GPS.
- I'm kidding.
- Billy said I'd like you.
So, where should we start?
Bro! Bro, bro, check this out.
- Don't you knock?
- There's no door.
- I thought I told you not to bug me.
- I know, but this was too good.
- What am I looking at?
- Our logo.
- OK...
- It just hit me.
It's our initials woven together
overlaid on the town's crest.
And look at the corner.
It's the year Dad came to Millwood.
You know, uh, he asks
about you all the time.
- It's not on the table.
- When was the last time you saw him?
Shane...
Are you gonna cry?
Don't cry, Billy.
Hey, it's OK.
Look, you don't have to cry, Billy.
Don't cry.
Get out! I'm working.
Shut down any online presence.
And whenever possible, deviate
from your normal routine.
They're using disruption as a strategy.
I used to do this
all the time at my old firm.
You ever hacked into someone's car?
Your safety is my main concern.
I'm not letting them
bully me off this job.
I'm gonna do whatever I can to help.
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?
The truth?
No.
I'll pick your car up from the garage.
It is all yours.
I'll try to track the IP address
for the threatening call,
but in the meantime,
any communication between us,
we use this.
We have to stay one step
ahead of them at all times.
And take this threat very seriously.
- Hello?
- Joanna, it's me.
Look, you were right.
Jared Lapinski is a major player.
<i>He's all over Lovand's website,
he worked in the same</i>
department as Noah,
and it looks like he specializes
in this exact type of code.
- Well, we're getting closer.
- <i>You find this guy,</i>
I think you'll have all
the answers you're looking for.
Indigenous women are going
missing and being murdered
at an astronomical rate.
A group of Winnipeggers had enough,
started Bear Clan Patrol.
We stop fights,
break-ins,
keep an eye on sex workers,
make sure intoxicated
people get home safely.
It's all about safety.
I've worked out a few broad strokes
that we can present them with.
Also drafted up a quick
partnership agreement between us.
- You don't trust me?
- Is that a trick question?
If this gains traction, we'll have
to go over this in more detail,
but let's just go through it for
now so we're on the same page.
Stout sampler while we do?
Yeah.
That's my boy.
Feels good to be home.
It's good to have you home.
Yeah, I had to get
the hell out of Dodge.
Alright. We'll split the
majority stake hold 50/50.
You maintain 100% ownership of the IP,
and I'm willing
to bankroll some start-up costs.
Really? You'd do that?
We get this going, we'd be able to hire
a few people right away, so...
that's something
I'm willing to invest in.
This is gonna hit, bro. I can feel it.
If it doesn't,
I built in a mutual out clause.
If either of us are unhappy
with the arrangement
at any time, we can exit.
Do we get to stay brothers?
Yeah, there's no loophole for that.
I've been looking for years.
To beer!
"If I were aboard a rowboat"
"floating in the middle of all the
beer I've drunk in a lifetime",
"I'd never be able to see the shore."
Al Purdy. His poems always
remind me of the old man.
Right. No-fly zone.
Sorry.
What?
I didn't say anything.
- Sorry, I thought.
- Dude, how "sampled" are you?
I'm good.
Brain fart.
Come on! Game face.
Alright. Go put on a clean shirt.
Actually...
put on one of mine.
We better get going.
Hi. I'm looking for Jared Lapinski.
- Who are you?
- My name is Joanna Chang.
I'm a lawyer at Steadman Lavery.
- Is this about the computer?
- I'm sorry?
Haven't you people done enough?
I was just hoping that I
could speak with Mr. Lapinski.
Then, you should have
been here a few days ago,
before he killed himself.
So, when we get there, I'm gonna
wow them with the opening spiel,
and then you come in and you wow
them with the numbers.
- Are you letting me drive?
- No, we're not driving.
What are you talking about?
Shane, I've been drinking
your beer since breakfast.
Dude, the legal limit in Millwood
is being able to find your keys.
Come on.
No. Not doing that again.
- Alright. Give me the keys.
- No, no. Wait,
you've been going non-stop
since you got here,
which we should also
talk about at some point.
I've been back for one day,
and you want to lecture me on
my self-medicating already?
"Self-medicating," is
that you're calling it?
That's what alcohol is, Billy boy.
It's the cause of and solution
to all of life's problems.
Is that more Al Purdy?
- Homer Simpson.
- Different kind of poet.
- Get in the truck, Billy.
- Not a chance.
I can't believe you're gonna
sabotage this for me, man.
- Whoa, calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down!
- Shane...
- Wind me up,
and you tell me to calm down?
Don't do that!
- Don't do that to me!
- Shane...
Sorry.
I... I feel like
I've got a lot of people
counting on me.
I got a lot riding on
this working out, Billy.
Look, it takes me 25 minutes
to jog from here to Main Street.
We got time, if we go at a good clip.
We're gonna jog into town?
Yeah, unless you don't
think you can keep up.
Let's go, old man.
What are you waiting for?
How did the Lapinski meeting go?
- It didn't, he's dead.
- Ouch!
He killed himself three days ago.
Double ouch. So I guess
that means you don't need
- that witness anymore.
- What are you talking about?
Lovand counsel, he's...
waiting to side-bar with
you in the conference room.
What? Lovand is here?!
- Yeah, I thought you knew that.
- No. They're trying
to get in my head.
They're doing this on purpose.
Next time, lead with that.
OK. Is this a teachable moment or
should I be looking for a new job?
I'm still deciding.
Meet me in the boardroom in 5.
It's apples and oranges.
One's blonde, the other's a brunette.
One's got family money;
the other's wholesome...
Someone's holding a gun to your head.
- Betty.
- Really?
Yeah, Betty.
Wow! This is... Wow!
- You thought I'd go for money.
- Absolutely.
Where are you boys running to?
We're heading into town
for a business meeting.
Off to "Make Millwood great again."
We're going to meet
some potential investors
on a project that might bring
some work back to town.
I'm all for that. Where's the truck?
Wouldn't start.
- I'll give you a lift.
- Really?
Any chance to revive this town. Hop in.
- Shotgun!
- No.
So I ran into Gerrilynn.
She said she's thinking
about suing David Hanley.
- Why hasn't she called me?
- She's worried you're too close.
Like Hanley's family or something.
Uhhh, that piece of shit
is not part of our family.
Someone should've taken
a run at him years ago.
Anyway, I thought you should know.
Thanks.
Yo, Beck.
Betty or Veronica, who do you choose?
Buffy Sainte-Marie.
<i>When your call came into the office,</i>
<i>I kind of jumped to take the listing.</i>
Um, six degrees of David Hanley?
Yeah, something like that.
I'm sorry that I didn't call
when they dropped the
criminal charges, uh....
I was too, uh...
Yeah, me too. It's why I'm selling,
then I'll have the money
and take care of him myself.
Oh, no, I'm not putting
a hit out on him.
Too bad. I'd have chipped in.
I'm suing him for sexual misconduct
and coercing a minor.
Well, you're a braver woman than me.
Or just stupider.
This is Luna's room.
She's been away all year,
but I haven't had the heart
to change things much.
Best moments of my life
happened in this room:
bringing her tea,
snuggling her to sleep.
But it's just a house, right?
Kinda seemed more like a home.
Never had one of those.
Me neither.
That's what he knew,
what he took advantage of.
Prick.
Yeah. Either way,
Luna's a lucky girl.
Mhm. So am I.
So, what do you think
I could get for this bad boy?
Umm, I made a preliminary assessment.
Don't sell the house.
Cases like ours, guys like him;
even if you win,
it's not gonna be enough.
It's never gonna be enough.
- I want him to pay.
- So do I.
I just don't want you to
any more than you already have.
Hey!
- Hey!
- I got you some green juice
- and a Flexi nature bar thing.
- Thanks,
but I'm actually too excited to eat.
Oh, it's not really like
eating; it's more like work.
So Bear Clan was cool?
Oh, my God, Tay!
I know it was just orientation,
but I feel like my eyes
have been opened.
That's amazing!
Maybe now you'll have a place
to channel some of
your David-Hanley rage.
Sorry. I shouldn't call it rage.
Oh, no, no. It's rage.
I was just thinking
how I'd like to channel
some of it directly at him.
- You mean like, confront him?
- I've thought about it.
What would you say?
I don't know. Or what I'd do.
Do you think it's weird
that I texted you to meet me
here and not Molly?
I don't know. I think
sometimes you need to talk
to someone you're not
also sleeping with.
I just... I feel like,
since I got back,
like I'm bringing her down
or something.
She hasn't said anything to me.
Oh, we're just in
different places, I guess.
Maybe you guys need to move
in different directions for a while...
to realize how much you guys
need to come back together.
- When did you get so wise?
- When my father
poisoned our hometown
and gave me cancer.
And that grows you up a bit.
Yeah.
Have you decided what you're
gonna do about the letter?
No. Not yet.
Well, you know,
whichever way you decide,
I've got your back.
Right back at you.
Shane, are those your investors?
This right here
is what we're looking at
as an initial investment.
And that would be amortized?
Over a five-year operating
budget, that's correct.
We've got our feelers
out on several projects,
but we're really looking
for our Trivial Pursuit.
Our gran was one of
the initial investors.
A thousand-buck investment
turned into twenty mil. Bam!
Well, I'm not sure we can offer
those kind of profit margins.
- My brother's just being cautious.
- Realistic.
Guys, can you do a cannabis beer?
Seriously, dude, the government
just put 600k into research on it.
A weed beer?
- Sick!
- Hahaha!
Can we see this location
where we're planning
to build this oasis of ale?
- We'd like to take some specs.
- For sure.
Road trip! Love it!
I'll call Jeff, the property manager,
tell him to meet us there.
Let's bounce!
They're Trustafarians.
People come in all shades
and colours, Billy boy,
but money is always green.
Hey, who's Jeff?
Jeff. You know Jeff.
<i>The app is still</i>
up and running; that has got to change.
I have advised my client to
comply with the injunction.
- And why hasn't he?
- You know as well as I do
that clients don't always
listen to their lawyers.
Maybe we haven't been
persuasive enough.
His contempt hearing
is in less than two hours.
- We'd like to avoid it.
- So would we.
- How we can make that happen?
- Lift the injunction against my client.
That's not an option.
He pulls the app,
we cover all legal fees
incurred to this point.
My client owns a company,
a new start-up called Novatech
based in Silicon Valley.
Novatech is all about
innovation and privacy.
Right up Mr. Achari's alley.
My client is willing to
make him operating manager.
- Starting salary?
- One that you or I can't even fathom.
If he rejects this offer,
of course, we'll have no choice
but to see you in court.
I will take the offer to my client.
I think I need to check my underwear.
- It's a good offer.
- It's a great offer.
He'd be stupid not to take it.
- I'm not taking it.
- Please!
Forget it!
I'm not working for the enemy.
You worked for them before!
<i>And look how well that
turned out for Lapinski.</i>
This is an interesting offer, Noah.
The only interesting thing about it
is the fact that you thought
it was worth sharing with me.
OK, as your lawyer, I have to
advise you to take this deal.
And as your client, I have
to advise you that you're fired.
You are due in court
to face contempt charges
in less than two hours.
Yeah, OK, and I'll be there, alone.
From now on, I'm representing myself.
Hello?
I managed to track the IP
address for the car hacking.
- Lovand?
- <i>Yes.</i>
Good thing you didn't
mention them to the cops.
- Why?
- <i>They're defense contractors.</i>
<i>Where do you think
retired cops go to work?</i>
Watch your back... more than ever now.
Someone was blackmailing him.
I have proof.
Please.
Come in.
Thought your guy was meeting us here.
He should be here.
- Did you actually talk to him?
- Left a message.
We like you guys and
this project quite a bit,
but it'd really help
to see the facility.
- Screw it!
- Hey, what are you doing?
Jeff won't mind if we
get started without him.
Come on, fellas.
Unless you boys don't
think you can scale it.
Partner, you coming?
Damnit, Shane.
He wasn't himself for months before.
Paranoid, withdrawn.
Now I know why.
Perfect credit score to bankruptcy.
Online casino debts,
Ashley Madison account...
Why didn't he tell me
that he was being set up?
I don't know.
Maybe he was trying to protect you.
What?
A few weeks back, he got really drunk,
which also really wasn't like him,
and he started saying all the
horrible things he'd done at work.
How much did you know
- about what he did at work?
- Not a lot.
I know he worked for a small firm here
that was owned by a huge
conglomerate based in Houston.
Lovand?
When I came by earlier,
you mentioned his computer.
The police seized his computer.
They received an anonymous tip
that he was in possession
of child pornography.
And then that night, he...
I knew it couldn't be true.
I knew he wasn't capable
of that, but then...
- But then he killed himself.
- Yeah.
- And you thought...
- Yeah.
I can't believe I doubted him.
He was just trying to protect me.
Am I still in danger?
The night he got really drunk,
he started talking about
his family, that we were
somehow his vulnerability,
that somehow he put us in harm's way.
Hey, Joanna.
What have you done with my sister?
Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
No. I don't know. Difficult client.
Wanna come in for a cup of tea?
- Yeah, I'd love that.
- OK.
How long are we gonna wait, bro?
Jeff should be here in a minute.
You've been saying
that for half an hour.
What a bust! Guy's a freak.
- Oh! Come again?
- Dude, it's OK.
No, I know it's OK.
I just want to make
sure I heard you right.
Did I stutter?
Your little boy bro's a freak.
Guys, let's keep it calm.
Rivers of beer, lakes of money.
Let's jet, man. 'Cause I need to leave
this hick, douche town.
OK.
Ah!
Yeah, they weren't the
right fit for us anyway.
Zip it, Shane.
He deserved to be punished...
our father, but...
...but I didn't want him to be.
Not like you did.
Do you think it was a mistake
moving in here with her?
What? You and Molly?
- No, you guys make a great team.
- I know.
But living together, it's different.
I would not know.
I've never lived with anyone.
Oh, I think I might know someone
you work in the flesh and blood with...
Oh, saved by the text.
We're not done with this.

Luna, where's your computer?
<i>We have laws to protect our privacy.</i>
<i>Breaking and entering, peeping toms,</i>
<i>stalking; these are crimes.</i>
So what am I looking at?
You know, that difficult client?
He's representing himself
in a contempt hearing.
<i>Corporations manipulate what
we watch, what we read...</i>
Is he allowed to video
record in a courtroom?
Absolutely not.
- Will he get arrested for that?
- Probably not.
<i>And we don't have any
kind of freedom, and so</i>
<i>we need laws that act...</i>
But he will definitely
get arrested for that.
<i>Not only will you have
no privacy in the future,</i>
<i>any privacy you thought
you had in the past</i>
<i>will vanish as well. Of course,</i>
<i>you'd argue this won't actually happen</i>
<i>because I don't have anything to hide</i>
<i>and the law protects me.</i>
<i>For now, that's half true.
Western societies</i>
- <i>are the main advocates...</i>
- Hey.
Are you following the Noah situation?
It's kind of hard not to.
It's all over the morning news cycle.
Well, the bail hearing is in an hour.
- <i>Privacy issues...</i>
- He broke up with me.
<i>I didn't hire a quitter.</i>
- It's time to win him back.
- I'm on it.
<i>Joanna,</i>
<i>we only get one shot at
this, don't screw it up.</i>
<i>...advocating for less

<i>We can change the future!
In fact, we must!</i>
<i>Every lawyer I've spoken to says</i>
this case isn't worth taking.
That's because you
haven't spoken to me yet.
- I'm going to pay you.
- Of course.
After we win.
Now, the first order
of business will be
to create a statement of claim.
- Sounds daunting.
- It's not.
It's just your story.
Everything you remember about
your encounters with David Hanley.
You got any whiskey for this coffee?
Now, this will be public record,
so anything you say can and,
knowing Hanley, will
likely be contested.
I'm gonna record this if that's
alright with you.
- You're ready?
- Are you kidding?
I've been waiting 20 years for this.
I met David at the Millwood
Golf and Country Club,
where he was a member and I worked.
I was just a kid.
Brought you hash browns.
I crashed at Julia's last night.
You got my text, right?
- Are you mad at me?
- Stop.
Stop. Stop.
I'm gonna shower.
You can come with me if you want...
Yeah. Well, I don't
like to be humiliated.
Yes! Yes, that's exactly
what happened, Jeff.
No, no, I had my people there,
ready to open their wallets,
and all you had to do was show up.
So what are you gonna do about it?
I thought you were
a serious businessman.
I thought that I was dealing with a...
No, don't. Don't...
No. No, it's not.
No, it's not.
Oh, don't say that to me.
Don't say that to me.
I don't need you.
It's not true. It's not true.
Mr. Achari,
you are being charged with one
count under the Justice Act
for video recording in court
and one count of assaulting
a peace officer.
Do you have a lawyer?
Uh... I'm actually representing myself.
Not at a show cause hearing you're not.
I'm appointing duty counsel.
Mr. Tillson.
Your Majesty,
Mr. Achari was already being
held in contempt of court
when he took it upon himself to record
and livestream the proceedings.
- I was just proving a point.
- Sir.
I just find it really interesting
how fiercely the court protects
its own privacy when...
- Sir!
- Mr. Achari,
I advise you to remain silent.
Mr. Tillson, proceed.
When an officer of the
peace tried to stop
Mr. Achari and apprehend his phone,
Mr. Achari shoved the
officer, and a tussle ensued.
Is there a surety present in the court?
- Yeah.
- State your name for the court.
Mara Tran.
What's your relationship
to the accused?
I'm his girlfriend, business partner.
You live together?
- Yeah.
- Any kids?
OK. I don't see how that's
- any of your business...
- Sir! No, no.
You know what?
I have no reason to believe
that you are gonna stop
thumbing your nose at my court.
And for that reason, I am detaining you
with no bond.
- No, you can't do that!
- No, no. It's not fair!
Your Majesty, Joanna Chang,
counsel for the accused.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic. If I may?
If it'll stop him from talking.
First, let me just say
I'm sorry that your courtroom
has been turned into a sideshow.
When I found out that you were
the justice presiding,
I did a little research,
and I found a blog post you wrote
dated April 2017.
Where, in reference
to an intern who apparently
didn't work out,
you wrote a lengthy rant
against the Millennial generation
with their "avocado toast"
and "faces glued to screens
like drooling baboons"
"thinking that they should
get trophies for being gluten-free."
Should I go on?
Because of your obvious animus
against my client, technology
and, really, his entire generation,
we ask that you recuse yourself
from this file, Your Majesty.
You were bloody brilliant, lady.
- "Lady"?
- Joanna, meet Mara.
<i>Enchantée.</i>
Those are some serious bond conditions;
you make sure he sticks to them.
Oh, don't worry, I have my ways.
Look, I feel like I owe you an apology.
Save your breath.
You gained 100000
new followers last night.
150. Who's counting?
You got arrested on purpose
as a publicity stunt.
It was a command performance.
- Yours wasn't so bad either.
- We got a lot of work to do.
That is if I am still your lawyer.
You know, I think this
is the start of a...
beautiful friendship.
