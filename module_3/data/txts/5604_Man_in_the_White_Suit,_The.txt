<i>I FEEL IT MY DUTY TO REVEAL</i>
<i>SOMETHING OF THE TRUE STORY</i>
<i>A STORY WHICH WE WERE HAPPILY</i>
<i>ABLE TO KEEP OUT OF THE</i>
<i>THE TROUBLE BEGAN--</i>
<i>NOT IN MY OWN MILL,</i>
<i>BUT DURING MY VISIT TO THE MILL</i>
<i>OWNED BY MICHAEL CORLAND,</i>
<i>WHICH MANUFACTURES</i>
<i>AN ARTIFICIAL FIBER,</i>
<i>CORLAND IS</i>
<i>A PERSONABLE YOUNG MAN,</i>
<i>WHO SEEMED TO HAVE IMPRESSED</i>
<i>MY DAUGHTER.</i>
<i>HE WAS ALSO ANXIOUS</i>
<i>TO IMPRESS ME,</i>
<i>WITH THE IDEA THAT HIS MILL WAS</i>
<i>A SOUND FINANCIAL INVESTMENT.</i>
OUTPUT IS EXCELLENT.
SIX MILLION YARDS
HOW MANY?
SIX MILLION.
THAT'S RIGHT,
ISN'T IT, HILL?
SIX MILLION FEET.
YES, MR. CORLAND.
FEET, OF COURSE.
[ Chuckles ]
GOOD MORNING. I'M LUNCHING HERE
WITH MR. CORLAND AND MY FATHER.
THEY'RE STILL LOOKING
AROUND THE MILL, MISS BIRNLEY.
WOULD YOU CARE TO WAIT
IN MR. CORLAND'S OFF--
UM, MICHAEL.
HELLO, DADDY.
NOW, NOW, DAPHNE,
PLEASE DON'T INTERRUPT.
I'M HAVING A MOST
ILLUMINATING TOUR.
THIS WAY, MR. BIRNLEY.
OH, THIS WAY.
HOW'S IT GOING?
STICKY.
WHY, WHAT DOES HE SAY?
OH, NOTHING.
OH, THAT'S ONLY HIS
"KINGPIN OF INDUSTRY" ACT.
"FORTY GLORIOUS YEARS
IN TEXTILES." DON'T
I'M SURE HE'LL PUT UP
ALL THE MONEY YOU WANT.
<i>[ Clattering ]</i>
SORRY... SIR.
COME ON. COME ON.
OF COURSE, IT'S HARDLY
UP TO WHAT YOU HAVE
QUITE.
EH, FOR INSTANCE, SIR,
IF YOU'D STEP THIS WAY.
<i>MR. GREEN, PERHAPS</i>
<i>YOU WOULD SHOW MR. BIRNLEY...</i>
<i>THE LATEST THING</i>
<i>YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON.</i>
<i>[ Liquid Bubbling ]</i>
[ Rhythmic Bubbling, Gurgling ]
JUST A MOMENT, GREEN.
THANK YOU.
WHAT'S THIS?
<i>I REALLY COULDN'T SAY,</i>
<i>MR. BIRNLEY. MR. GREEN,</i>
<i>PERHAPS</i>
<i>YOU WOULD EXPLAIN.</i>
WELL, IT'S, UH--
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S, UH--
[ Whistles ]
<i>[ Green ]</i>
<i>MR. WILKINS?</i>
IS, UH, THIS YOURS?
NO, SIR.
<i>[ Green ]</i>
<i>HARRISON?</i>
[ Wheezes ]
YOURS?
NO, SIR.
I THOUGHT IT WAS... HIS.
[ Men Chattering ]
WELL, DOES IT MATTER,
MERELY A MATTER
OF INTEREST.
<i>COULD YOU SPARE US</i>
<i>A MOMENT?</i>
WHAT IS THIS?
[ Rhythmic Bubbling,
Gurgling Continues ]
DON'T YOU KNOW?
I THINK IT WAS
A SPECIAL JOB.
WHO FOR?
COME ALONG.
COME ALONG.
APPARENTLY YOU DID.
<i>[ Corland ]</i>
<i>REALLY, MR. GREEN, YOU MUST KNOW</i>
<i>[ All Talking At Once ]</i>
<i>WHAT DOES IT MATTER, ANYWAY?</i>
<i>I THINK YOU'RE BEING VERY RU--</i>
THERE MUST BE SOME QUITE
ORDINARY EXPLANATION.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
THE THING CAN'T
MR. HILL, WILL YOU
PLEASE FIND OUT
YES, SIR.
GREEN, CHECK WITH
OF COURSE. TAKE THEM
THE ORDER NUMBER.
UH, VERY GOOD, SIR.
RIGHT AWAY, SIR.
"3-7-8-2-5.
3-7-8-2-5."
[ Rhythmic Bubbling,
Gurgling Continues ]
<i>[ Chattering ]</i>
<i>I'M SO SORRY.</i>
<i>I REALLY SHOULDN'T</i>
ON THE CONTRARY.
SHALL WE LUNCH?
I THINK YOU'VE SEEN
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.
"3-7-8-2-5."
HERE IT IS.
[ Diners Chattering ]
£4,000?
BUT SPENT ON WHAT?
HYDROGEN, SIR.
HEAVY HYDROGEN.
THIS IS ABSOLUTE NONSENSE!
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!
I WANT TO AIM
AT MATERIALS AND DESIGNS,
COMBINING THE STRENGTH
AND SIMPLICITY...
OF THE OLD ENGLISH
HAND LOOM WEAVERS,
OF THE FLEMISH
OR PROVENÇAL.
NOW, IF I HAD
AN EXTRA HUNDRED THOUSAND--
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
AFTER LUNCH, HILL.
IT'S VERY URGENT.
AFTER LUNCH, HILL!
WHERE WAS I?
WELL, YOU MUSTN'T
LET US KEEP YOU
NO, IT'S NOTHING.
NOTHING.
[ Coughing ]
WHAT IS IT, MICHAEL?
IT'S NOTHING.
EXCUSE ME,
SO I TOLD HIM.
MR. WILKINS!
YES?
<i>MR. CORLAND WANTS YOU.</i>
<i>HE'S IN ACCOUNTS.</i>
<i>MR. HARRISON!</i>
[ Gulps, Coughs ]
THEY WANT YOU, TOO,
IN ACCOUNTS.
EXCUSE ME.
COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE
<i>[ Bubbling Continues ]</i>
<i>[ Woman ]</i>
<i>STRATTON!</i>
<i>NO, MR. CORLAND,</i>
<i>YOU'RE NOT FIRING ME.</i>
I'M NOT A CHEAT, NOR A SWINDLER.
I DID WHAT I DID BECAUSE
I MAY HAVE HAD JUST
A MENIAL JOB HERE,
THEY GAVE ME A FIRST
AND A FELLOWSHIP.
I WOULD BE THERE STILL
IF THEY HADN'T BEEN
JUST AS YOU ARE
AND ALL THE OTHERS
BUT ONE DAY,
THERE'LL BE SOMEONE
I SHALL HAVE A LABORATORY
GIVEN TO ME.
A PROPER LABORATORY,
WITH REALLY MODERN EQUIPMENT.
AND ASSISTANTS OF MY OWN.
NO, DON'T INTERRUPT ME.
IT'S SMALL MINDS LIKE YOURS
THAT STAND IN THE WAY
<i>BUT THIS IS TOO BIG A THING,</i>
<i>BIGGER THAN YOU--</i>
<i>[ Water Sloshing ]</i>
I SEE YOU'VE BEEN DISCHARGED
FROM YOUR LAST SIX POSITIONS.
SEVEN.
OH.
OH, WELL, PERHAPS
A CHANGE IN ENVIRONMENT MIGHT--
OH, NO, IT MUST BE
A TEXTILE MILL.
I SEE THERE'S A VACANCY
AT THE BIRNLEY MILL, BUT--
YES, BUT--
THEY HAVE A RESEARCH LAB,
I'M AFRAID THIS HARDLY SUITS
YOUR QUALIFICATIONS.
THEY WANT A WORKS LABORER.
OH, THAT'LL SUIT ME.
<i>[ Machinery Clacking ]</i>
THAT'S A NICE PLACE
TO LEAVE IT, ISN'T IT?
<i>[ Hits Door ]</i>
<i>[ Clattering ]</i>
SORRY.
DON'T MENTION IT.
YOU'VE GOT IT LOADED
TOO HEAVY.
YOU WANT TO LEAVE IT
SO YOU CAN SEE OVER THE TOP.
OH. YES, OF COURSE.
THANKS.
NEW, AREN'T YOU?
UH, YES.
NEVER WORKED
IN A MILL BEFORE?
I KNOW.
LEAVE SCHOOL,
INTO THE FIRST
BLIND ALLEY JOB
TOO OLD FOR THAT.
INTO ANOTHER AND ANOTHER.
BY THE TIME YOU'RE 30,
WHAT ARE YOU?
FLOTSAM FLOATING
ON THE FLOOD TIDE
THERE'S CAPITALISM
FOR YOU.
IT WASN'T QUITE LIKE THAT.
I GOT A SCHOLARSHIP
TO CAMBRIDGE.
BUT YOU HADN'T GOT
THE OLD SCHOOL TIE.
OH, YOU CAN'T TELL ME.
DISCRIMINATION.
I'VE SEEN PLENTY.
WHERE WERE YOU GOING
THE LOADING BAY,
I THINK THEY CALL IT.
YOU WERE GOING
THE WRONG WAY ANYHOW.
<i>[ Siren Wails ]</i>
TEA UP.
OH, TEA? NO THANKS.
I THINK I'D RATHER--
TEA BREAK!
WE HAD TO FIGHT FOR IT.
JUST A MOMENT.
LOOK, UH, WE'D BETTER
HELP YOU WITH IT.
YES, SIR.
PETE, GIVE US
AND GET THESE GENTLEMEN
SOME OVERALLS.
WELL, WHERE'S SID?
SID!
<i>SID!</i>
NO, NO, QUITE WRONG.
<i>SID!</i>
WHERE'S IT GOT TO GO?
<i>UP TO THE LAB.</i>
<i>IT'S AN ELECTRO--</i>
<i>AND ELECTROLA--</i>
<i>AH, AT LAST!</i>
WE'D BETTER GO
MM, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL JOB.
NO, NO!
YOU MUST HAVE THE GUN FILAMENT
OFF BEFORE YOU SWITCH ON
OTHERWISE YOU'RE LIABLE
TO PUT 4,000 VOLTS
AND BLOW IT TO BITS.
QUITE.
THAT'S THE SPECIMEN STAGE
I SUPPOSE.
THE INTERMEDIATE
ALIGNMENT SECTION.
OF COURSE.
<i>[ Man ] IT SEEMS TO BE</i>
<i>ALL RIGHT. IF THE CHIEF'S</i>
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU COULD SPARE SOMEONE
JUST TILL WE GET
THE HANG OF IT?
WHAT, ME?
WELL, NOT NECESSARILY
ONE OF YOUR ASSISTANTS,
PERHAPS.
WELL, I SEE.
WELL, I-I THINK PERHAPS
I MIGHT MANAGE IT.
IN FACT, IT MIGHT
BE QUITE CONVENIENT.
YOU SURE YOU'RE
NOT TOO, UH, BUSY?
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS,
OF COURSE, BUT...
IF WHILE I'M HERE,
YOU COULD LET ME HAVE
OH, CERTAINLY, CERTAINLY.
UH, SEE TO THAT,
I COULDN'T SAY,
I'M SURE.
ALL RIGHT, LOVE.

HE DIDN'T SAY NOTHING
THIS MORNING.
<i>[ Children Playing ]</i>
SID, WHAT'S ALL THIS?
HARRY SAYS YOU'VE QUIT.
OH, YES, YES.
WHY?
WELL, YOU SEE, I--
YOU DIDN'T GET SACKED?
OH, NO, NO, NO.
THEN,
WELL, I'VE GOT THE CHANCE
OF ANOTHER JOB.
WHERE?
AT BIRNLEYS,
YOU HAVEN'T QUIT, THEN?
YES AND NO.
I GOT THE CHANCE OF WORKING
IN THE LABORATORY.
OH, YES, MUCH.
AND MORE MONEY?
WELL, I SHAN'T ACTUALLY
GET PAID FOR IT.
WHAT?
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.
THE WORKS COMMITTEE
HAD BETTER HEAR ABOUT THIS.
NOT WANT TO?
I DON'T CARE WHETHER
YOU'VE GOT TO GET PAID.
BERTHA, YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT.
IT'S ONLY FOR A FEW WEEKS.
I PROMISE YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
DO FOR MONEY?
I WAS GOING TO SPEAK TO YOU
ABOUT THAT, MRS. WATSON.
I KNOW IT'S A LOT TO ASK,
BUT... IF I COULD OWE YOU
ONLY THE RENT--
I SHAN'T NEED ANY FOOD.
YOU'LL NOT NEED FOOD?
OH, I'LL GET THAT
OF COURSE YOU CAN STAY,
MR. STRATTON.
THANKS VERY MUCH,
INDEED.

SID,
ARE YOU IN TROUBLE?
NO. EVERYTHING'S FINE.
I'VE... GOT SOME MONEY
IN THE POST OFFICE.
NOT VERY MUCH,
BUT YOU COULD HAVE IT
I CAN GET MOST OF
WHAT I NEED AT THE LAB.
BUT IF THERE ARE A FEW ODDMENTS,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW. THANKS.
ANYTIME.
I'M EVEN GLAD, MICHAEL.
YOU GET NO MONEY FROM FATHER.
ALL RIGHT. I'M FREER
TO SAY WE'LL GET MARRIED
YOU'RE-- YOU'RE VERY SWEET,
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MICHAEL?
I WOULDN'T DREAM
OF LETTING YOU MARRY ME
NOT UNTIL YOU CAN DO IT
IN PERFECTLY COLD BLOOD.
WELL, I MUST BE OFF.
I HAVE TO LOOK AROUND
IN SOME OTHER DIRECTION.
<i>[ Door Closes ]</i>
DADDY.
I THOUGHT YOU'D GONE,
DAPHNE.
FATHER, I KNOW WHAT
YOU THINK ABOUT MICHAEL.
YOU THINK ALL HE WANTS
IS MY MONEY.
HMM. MINE.
WELL, IT JUST SO HAPPENS
HE'S GOING TO FIND
SOME OTHER WAY TO DO
SPLENDID!
AND HE STILL WANTS ME!
WELL, IF YOU
WANT HIM, DAPHNE,
THEN I'M VERY GLAD.
SO, NOW WILL YOU CHANGE
WELL, IF THAT MEANS-- WILL I
INVEST IN HIM IN SPITE OF WHAT
JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS
A LUNATIC IN THE PLACE,
<i>IT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED</i>
<i>TO ANYONE.</i>
IN THE BIRNLEY MILLS,
FOR INSTANCE?
AND EVERYTHING
CONNECTED WITH THEM.
AND THE SOONER I LEAVE HOME,
THE HAPPIER I SHALL BE.
SORRY.
HEY! WAIT!
HM, HM, HM.
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
<i>[ Rhythmic Bubbling</i>

[ Horn Honks ]

- MISS BIRNLEY!
PLEASE DON'T TELL
YOUR FATHER.
HOW NICE.
DOES HE KNOW?
I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL HIM.
MISS BIRNLEY!
LOOK, MISS BIRNLEY!
JUST GIVE ME TWO MORE DAYS.
ONE EVEN. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT
IT'S GOING TO
ASTOUND THE WORLD!
<i>[ Tires Skid ]</i>
LOOK. YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE PROBLEM OF POLYMERIZING
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
LOOK. YOU KNOW WHAT
A LONG-CHAIN MOLECULE IS?
A WHAT?
DO YOU KNOW
NO.
SOMETHING LIKE AN ATOM?
THAT'S IT!
ATOMS STUCK TOGETHER.
IN THIS CASE, LIKE A LONG CHAIN.
NOW, COTTON AND SILK
AND EVERY NATURAL FIBER
AND RECENTLY WE'VE LEARNED
TO MAKE ARTIFICIAL FIBERS
SUCH AS, UM,
RAYON AND NYLON.
YOU'VE HEARD OF NYLON?
WELL, I THINK I'VE SUCCEEDED
IN THE COPOLYMERIZATION...
OF AMINO ACID RESIDUES
AND CARBOHYDRATE MOLECULES.
BOTH CONTAINING IONIC GROUPS.
IT'S REALLY PERFECTLY SIMPLE.
<i>I BELIEVE I'VE GOT</i>
<i>THE RIGHT CATALYST</i>
<i>BETWEEN THE REACTIVE GROUPS</i>

IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
JUST A MINUTE.
I'M USING THAT.
- WHAT'S ALL THIS?
- WHERE'S MR. BIRNLEY?
<i>MR. STRATTON,</i>
<i>WHAT'S THE MATTER?</i>
MR. HOSKINS, IT'S WORKED.
I'VE DONE IT!
THE RADIOACTIVE GROUPS IN
THE FIBER-FORMING MOLECULES...
HAVEN'T CATALYZED
THE INTERNAL REARRANGEMENT.
NOT IN THE LEAST.
I THOUGHT THE POLYMERIZATION
BUT IT WASN'T. IT WASN'T.
WHERE ARE MY NOTES?
MR. STRATTON--
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- I'VE DONE IT! I'VE DONE IT!

THAT IS, I DID WORK AT THE MILL.
YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?
NO, BUT YOU SEE,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER

WELL, CAN YOU FIND
HIS PRIVATE NUMBER,
OH, DO TRY.
HOW CAN IT BE IMPOSSIBLE?
I'VE GOT THEM HERE. BUT--
LET ME SPEAK TO HIM.
OH, IT'S YOU.
HELLO.
YES, I HAVE, BUT I--
COME RIGHT IN.
LOOK. LISTEN,

WHAT IS IT, KNUDSEN?
NO, I DON'T CARE
WHAT HIS NAME IS.
VERY WELL, THEN.

WHY, HANG IT ALL,

YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET IT.
YOU NEED
A GOOD SPANKING.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HE'S DONE.
WELL, APART FROM
COSTING ME £8,000,
HE'S MADE A NEW KIND OF CLOTH.
IT NEVER GETS DIRTY,
WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
OH, IT IS, IS IT?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
A LONG-CHAIN MOLECULE IS?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS?
IT MEANS THAT

IT MEANS,
FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES,
AND IT HAS A SURFACE CHARGE
OF STATIC ELECTRICITY.
IT REPELS DIRT.
THAT MAY BE NONSENSE,
OF COURSE.
MAYBE HE HASN'T REALLY DONE IT.
MAYBE HE'S TALKING
ON THE OTHER HAND,
MAYBE HE HAS.
MAYBE YOU'RE TALKING
THROUGH YOURS.

YOU DON'T KNOW,
AND YOU'RE TOO PIGHEADED
TO FIND OUT.

AND MIDDLEMEN.
IT'LL RUIN ALL OF THEM!
<i>THE POINT.</i>
- WHAT ABOUT US?
- WELL, I'LL ADMIT
MAY SUFFER TEMPORARILY.
BUT I WILL NOT STAND
IN THE WAY OF PROGRESS.
THE WELFARE
OF THE COMMUNITY
YOU'RE NOT LIKELY
TO SUFFER MUCH.
MICHAEL, THAT'S
UNWORTHY OF YOU.
SURELY YOU REALIZE THIS IS
THE GREATEST STEP FORWARD.
OVER A PRECIPICE.
IT MEANS DISASTER.
DISASTER?
WAS THE SPINNING
WAS THE MECHANICAL LOOM?
FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T
BESIDES,
THEY INCREASED OUTPUT.
JUST ARRIVING NOW, SIR.
HE'S THE ONE TO MAKE
THE COMPLAINT, ISN'T HE?
<i>WORKER'S PLAYTIME?</i>
<i>IT'S SID!</i>
LOOK WHOSE CAR.
SID!
<i>HELLO, BERTHA.</i>
HELLO.
WHAT HAVE
WELL, IT'S REALLY
WHAT I'VE DONE.
WE ARE JUST GOING TO
ANNOUNCE IT TO THE PRESS.
MY NEW FIBER.
MIND!
MR. CORLAND.
IN MR. BIRNLEY'S OFFICE.
IT NEVER GETS DIRTY?
AND NEVER WEARS OUT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF HIM?
AND YOU THINK THEY'LL
GO AHEAD WITH IT?
YOU'RE NOT EVEN BORN YET.
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED
TO ALL THE OTHER THINGS?
THE RAZOR BLADE
THAT NEVER GETS BLUNT.
AND THE CAR THAT RUNS
ON WATER, WITH A PINCH
NO. THEY'LL NEVER
LET YOUR STUFF ON THE MARKET
<i>HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW.</i>
<i>VESTED INTEREST.</i>
THE DEAD HAND OF MONOPOLY.
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL,
<i>EVERYTHING'S ORGANIZED.</i>
<i>WE'RE TELLING THE NEWSPAPERS</i>
<i>AND THEN GOING RIGHT AHEAD.</i>
BUT IF THIS STUFF
NEVER WEARS OUT, WE'LL ONLY
<i>- THAT'S RIGHT.</i>
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FIRST OF ALL,
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.
DIDN'T RECOGNIZE A GENIUS
WHEN I SAW ONE.
EXCUSE ME, SIR. I--
I'VE JUST COME
ONE OR TWO THINGS
HE ASKED ME TO STRAIGHTEN OUT.
<i>[ Train Whistle Blows ]</i>
THAT'S LOVELY.
SIX MONTHS'S WORK
EVERY MILL IN THE COUNTRY
WILL BE LAID OFF.
IT'S BIRNLEY'S DOING.
SIDNEY WOULDN'T INVENT
SOMETHING OUGHTA
BE DONE ABOUT IT.
SOMETHING IS GONNA BE DONE.
WE'LL GET THE WORKS COMMITTEE
I DON'T WANT TO
BE SELFISH ABOUT IT.
LATER ON,
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO OFFER IT
UNDER LICENSE.
YOU WANT US
<i>WHILE YOU BUILD UP</i>
<i>ANOTHER FORTUNE IN ROYALTIES</i>
<i>[ Birnley ]</i>
<i>WELL, AFTER ALL, MAY I POINT OUT</i>
DO YOU?
OF COURSE I DO.
A SORDID MATTER
OF DETAILS, SIR JOHN.
WELL?
STRATTON'S DIARY OF HIS FIRST
DATE: SEPTEMBER 15.
STRATTON'S CONTRACT
WITH MR. BIRNLEY--
<i>DATE: OCTOBER 1.</i>
[ Stammers ]
SIR JOHN.
<i>[ Wheezing ]</i>
I EXPECT HE'S
ON HIS WAY TO US NOW,
<i>THE WORKS COMMITTEE?</i>
<i>I'M SORRY, MR. BIRNLEY'S BUSY.</i>
NO. NO, NO, NO,
I CAN'T INTERRUPT HIM NOW.
NO! NO!
MR. DAVIDSON, WAIT!
SIR JOHN, KIERLAW.
MR. CRANFORD.
HOW DO YOU DO?
MR. MANNERING.
HOW DO YOU DO?
MR. CORLAND YOU KNOW,
THIS IS MR. STRATTON,
GENTLEMEN.
WHAT'S THIS?
A NEW CONTRACT.
SIGN IT, YOUNG MAN.
WHAT WAS WRONG
WITH THE OLD ONE?
WELL, THIS IS
A BIG THING, SIDNEY.
TOO BIG FOR ONE MILL.
AND SO I DECIDED
IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRING IN
I SEE.
[ Intercom Buzzes ]
YES?
[ Woman ] MR. BIRNLEY,
IT'S THE WORKS COMMITTEE.
NO, NO, I'M BUSY.
IT'S URGENT!
MR. BIRNLEY
WILL SEE THEM LATER.
I THINK
IT'S ALL IN ORDER.
THANKS.
OH, THAT'S INGENIOUS.
- MAY I?
<i>- OF COURSE.</i>
HOW MUCH PETROL
AS AGAINST HOW MUCH INK?
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
THERE'S JUST ONE THING--
WILSON, MY ASSISTANT.
HE'S BEEN A GREAT HELP ON THIS,
AND I'D LIKE HIM TO GET
OF COURSE.
WE ALL REALIZE THE VALUE
I MEAN, WHEN THE RESULTS
ARE PUBLISHED, I'D LIKE
THERE MAY BE A LITTLE DELAY
IN PUBLICATION, OF COURSE.
DELAY? OH.
WHY?
YOU SEE, SIDNEY,
WE HAVE TO WAIT
WHY NOT NOW?
TO ANNOUNCE IT
MIGHT UPSET
THE DELICATE BALANCE
WOULD IT?
BUT WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SELL
LEAVE THESE PROBLEMS
TO US, MR. STRATTON.
<i>JUST SIGN THE DOCUMENT.</i>
<i>[ Birnley ]</i>
YOU ARE GOING AHEAD
WITH PRODUCTION?
WELL, SIDNEY, I--
I'D LIKE TO THINK THIS OVER.
<i>YOUNG MAN, COME HERE.</i>
WE NEED CONTROL
OF THIS DISCOVERY.
<i>COMPLETE CONTROL.</i>
<i>IF YOU WANT TWICE THE AMOUNT</i>
A QUARTER OF A MILLION.
- TO SUPPRESS IT?
- YES.
<i>[ Train Whistle Blows ]</i>
EXCUSE ME.
[ Intercom Buzzing ]
WAIT! NOW LISTEN,
ALL OF YOU!
SIDNEY! SIDNEY!
<i>[ Sir John ]</i>
<i>STOP HIM!</i>
<i>[ Clattering ]</i>
THIS IS TOO MUCH
NO, NO, NO, WAIT.
YES, MR. BIRNLEY?
<i>S-S-SIDNEY, NO!</i>
- I BEG YOUR PARDON,
MR. BIRNLEY?
<i>[ Sir John ]</i>
<i>STOP HIM!</i>
LOOK HERE.
YOU CAN'T--
[ Screams ]
<i>STOP A MINUTE!</i>
[ Grunts ]
STOP HIM!
STOP HIM! STOP HIM!
FOR GOODNESS SAKE,
STOP HIM!
STOP HIM. HE--
HE MUSTN'T LEAVE THE MILL.
HOW CAN WE STOP HIM?
BY FORCE.
BY FORCE? I WILL NOT
RESORT TO VIOLENCE.
IF HE SELLS
TO ANYBODY ELSE,
THEN WE MUST REASON
WITH THE BOY.
HOW CAN WE REASON WITH HIM
WHEN HE'S NOT HERE?
YES, SIR?
THIS WAY, GENTLEMEN.
<i>OH, I'M SORRY.</i>
<i>WRONG FLOOR!</i>
<i>[ Clattering, Thud ]</i>
IS HE ALL RIGHT?
YES.
PITY.
<i>[ Children Chattering</i>
<i>In Distance ]</i>
ANY NEWS OF HIM?
HE'S UP AT BIRNLEY'S.
WHAT DID I TELL YA?
RIGHT IN THEIR POCKET.
YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO TALK
LIKE THAT. PERHAPS
THEY SAY
HE HAD A HEADACHE.
BIRNLEY WON'T SEE
THE WORKS COMMITTEE
<i>[ Knocking ]</i>
THERE.
MR. STRATTON LIVES HERE?
YES, BUT, UH--
NOW HE'S GOING TO
LIVE WITH MR. BIRNLEY.
<i>I'VE COME TO COLLECT</i>
<i>HIS BAGGAGE. ALSO,</i>
NOW WHO'S RIGHT?
IT'S JUST AS I TOLD YOU.
SITTING RIGHT IN THEIR LAPS.
<i>[ Chattering ]</i>
<i>WELL, GIVE ME SOME FIGURES.</i>
<i>FALLEN TO WHAT?</i>
46.9?
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, DON'T SELL.
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
THERE'S NOT A WORD
YES, YES.
I'LL BE ON-- ON HERE
WELL, THAT'S JUST
THE BEGINNING.
HELLO, YES?
YEAH? CALCUTTA?
TOMORROW'LL BE A NOSEDIVE.
JUST ON THESE RUMORS.
IT'S ABSURD. THERE MUST
WELL, YOU SHOULD KNOW,
YOU STARTED THE FIRST ONE.
YOU KNOW VERY WELL--
SIR JOHN'S RIGHT. LET'S KEEP
ALL RIGHT, PUT HIM ON.
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT
AND THAT IS A DENIAL
BACKED WITH SUPPRESSION--
HELLO, MOTTRAM.
HOW? WE'VE ALREADY OFFERED
WELL, WE CAN'T KEEP HIM
HERE FOREVER. THERE ARE
I'VE GOT IT.
MAYBE I SHOULD TALK TO HIM,
I THINK NOT, MICHAEL.
I WILL--
GENTLEMEN! GENTLEMEN.
KNUDSEN?
HIS DOOR'S LOCKED.
I HAVE IT, MISS BIRNLEY.
[ Snaps Fingers ]
I'M SORRY, MISS BIRNLEY.
NO ONE GOES IN,
HE DOESN'T COME OUT.
THERE'S NO SENSE IN PURSUING
THIS BOY WITH MONEY!
WHAT ELSE COULD?
YES, YES, YES.
WOMEN?
HE DIDN'T SEEM TO ME
TO BE THE TYPE.
IT'S OFTEN THAT TYPE
THAT, UM--
VERY TRUE.
IF WE COULD JUST FIND
I MEAN, SOMEONE WHO KNEW
THE BEST WAY TO TALK TO HIM.
FATHER?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING TO SIDNEY?
<i>[ Birnley ]</i>
<i>NOW, REALLY, DAPHNE,</i>
<i>[ Daphne ]</i>
<i>I WANT TO KNOW JUST EXACTLY</i>
W-WILL YOU PLEASE--
I'M SORRY, FATHER--
<i>THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT</i>
<i>BUSINESS MEETING.</i>
STAND BY THE PHONE, WILL YOU?
I'LL RING YOU BACK.
UM, MISS BIRNLEY,
I TAKE IT YOU KNOW
HOW WELL?
WE'RE VERY GOOD FRIENDS.
WHY NOT?
WHY NOT? IT MAY BE
VERY USEFUL TO US.
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU--
[ Man ]
OH, IT'S FOR YOU.
HELLO?
SIT DOWN, MISS BIRNLEY.
<i>[ Birnley ]</i>
<i>NO, DAVIDSON, I CANNOT.</i>
MISS BIRNLEY,
WE'RE TRYING TO BUY
THE WORLD RIGHTS
BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM
TO TRUST US.
DOESN'T HE?
WHY NOT?
MISS BIRNLEY,
YOU'RE THE DAUGHTER
YOU MUST REALIZE HOW
RECKLESS EXPLOITATION...
OF ANYTHING NEW WOULD UPSET
THE DELICATE BALANCE OF TRADE.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
I AM BEGINNING TO.
GOOD. GOOD.
YOU WANT TO SUPPRESS IT.
BUT, GENTLEMEN, IF YOU AREN'T
ABLE TO PERSUADE HIM,
UH, ALL MEN ARE SUSCEPTIBLE,
MISS BIRNLEY.
I NEED HARDLY TELL YOU THAT
YOU'RE A VERY ATTRACTIVE GIRL.
THANK YOU.
<i>[ Birnley ]</i>
<i>TELL THEM I'LL</i>
<i>[ Daphne ]</i>
<i>WELL, MICHAEL,</i>
IT'S A DESPERATE
SITUATION, DAPHNE,
<i>FOR THE WHOLE INDUSTRY.</i>
YES. YES, I'M BEGINNING
TO REALIZE THAT.
<i>[ Cranford ]</i>
<i>THERE'S NO NEED TO EXPLAIN</i>
<i>WHEN I TELL YOU</i>
<i>WE'VE ALREADY OFFERED STRATTON</i>
<i>YOU CAN SEE</i>
<i>FOR YOURSELF.</i>
BUT, SINCE WE'RE ON
THE SUBJECT OF PRICE,
<i>- [ Cranford ]</i>
<i>MISS BIRNLEY!</i>
I HAVEN'T HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE
WITH THESE SORT OF THINGS,
BUT I'VE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD
IT WAS COMPARATIVELY WELL PAID.
NOW, MISS BIRNLEY--
THIS ISN'T ANYTHING
I SUGGEST 2,000.
AREN'T YOU RATING
MY VALUE A LITTLE LOW?
WOULDN'T 5,000 BE FAIRER?
FIVE THOUSAND. AGREED.
AGREED.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO DO
BUSINESS WITH YOU, SIR JOHN.
<i>AND ABOUT TIME TOO.</i>
I WANT TO
TALK TO YOU, SIDNEY.
I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU WOULD BE ON THEIR SIDE.
YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE ME,
SIDNEY, BUT I WANT
I-- I DON'T LIKE THIS
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.
I HATE THIS TOWN.
THE MILL, EVERYTHING.
PEOPLE WHO THINK OF NOTHING
BUT MONEYGRUBBING.
DON'T YOU FEEL
LIKE THAT?
I WANT TO
GET AWAY, SIDNEY.
I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING
OF THE WORLD BEYOND
TO MAKE A LIFE FOR MYSELF
WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE
ITALY, MAYBE.
FRANCE?
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU?
I CAN'T.
BUT YOU COULD.
AND YOU COULD TAKE ME.
HOW?
I KNOW WHAT THEY OFFERED YOU.
YOU COULD LIVE THE REST
GO ANYWHERE.
DO AS YOU PLEASE.
AND IF YOU WANT ME,
I'D COME TOO.
WHAT'S WRONG?
I'M SORRY. NO.
NOT EVEN IF IT MEANS ME?
NO.
THANK YOU, SIDNEY.
WHAT FOR?
<i>IF YOU'D SAID YES,</i>
<i>I'D HAVE STRANGLED YOU.</i>
NOW, WE'VE GOT TO GET
THAT SUIT TO THE NEWSPAPERS.
SHOW IT TO THEM
AND TELL THEM THE WHOLE STORY.
THAT WILL BLOW THE LID
OFF EVERYTHING, AND THEY'LL
BUT HOW?
WOULD YOU STAKE YOUR LIFE
ON THIS?
YOU CAN ISSUE
A CATEGORICAL DENIAL
THE STUFF DOES NOT EXIST.
IT HAS NEVER BEEN INVENTED.
IT NEVER COULD BE.
THERE IS NO PANIC HERE
WHATSOEVER.
CERTAINLY MR. BIRNLEY
WILL CONFIRM THAT.
<i>NO, NO, NO.</i>
<i>GOOD HEAVENS, DAVIDSON,</i>
I TOLD YOU TO DEAL WITH THEM
IN YOUR OWN WAY.
THEY'VE COME OUT.
ON STRIKE.
STRIKE?
<i>[ Davidson ]</i>
<i>I TRIED TO GET YOU</i>
<i>ON THE TELEPHONE,</i>
WELL, YOU BETTER GET THEM
BACK AT ALL COSTS. OTHERWISE,
<i>LANDSLIDE?</i>
<i>[ Davidson ]</i>
<i>[ Men Arguing ]</i>
<i>- THEN GO AND DO SOMETHING!</i>
- THEY WANT A GUARANTEE WE'RE
BUT, WE'RE NOT INTENDING TO.
GOOD HEAVENS, MAN, THAT'S
YES, I KNOW. BUT THEY WON'T
TAKE ONE'S WORD FOR ANYTHING.
OH, THIS IS INSANITY!
THEY'RE AFRAID OF BEING OUT
OF WORK AND SO THEY DOWN TOOLS.
<i>- [ Knocking ]</i>
- GET THEM UP HERE.
UP TO THE HOUSE.
I'LL TALK TO THEM.
[ Chuckles ]
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
BUT WHAT GUARANTEE
CAN WE GIVE THEM?
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
SIR JOHN--
<i>[ Loud Crash ]</i>
[ Whistling ]
IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF FIVEPENCE.
EXCUSE ME--
CAN YOU LET ME HAVE FIVEPENCE?
NO COPPERS AT ALL.
WELL, MORE WOULD DO.
I'VE GOT THREE AND ELEVEN,
BUT I WANT FOUR AND FOUR.
I COULD MORE THAN PAY YOU BACK
AS SOON AS I'VE DONE IT.
I'VE GOT SOME MONEY AT MY DIGS.
BETTER GET IT THEN.
KIERLAW OR ANYONE ELSE.
AND FRANK'LL--
<i>[ Bertha ]</i>
<i>IT'S SID!</i>

OH, I BEG YOUR PARDON.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

KINDLY LEAVE THIS ROOM?
OH, SID.
SORRY.
SID, I KNEW YOU'D
TURN OUT RIGHT IN THE END.
THEY TRIED TO SOFTEN YOU UP.

GENTLEMEN. AND IF
WHAT I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE
<i>HE COULD BE SUGGESTING--</i>
NOW, MY DEAR BIRNLEY,
