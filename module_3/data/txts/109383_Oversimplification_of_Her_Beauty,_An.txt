WOMAN: Are you recording?
MAN: Hmm?
Are you recording?
Maybe.
Yeah, you are.
(FOLK MUSIC PLAYING)
NARRATOR 1: <i>Pardon</i>
<i>my interruption.</i>
<i>What you are about</i>
<i> to see is a short</i>
<i> film entitled</i>
How Would You Feel?
<i>Created by one</i>
<i>Terence Nance in 2006.</i>
How Would You Feel?
<i>is an educational film</i>
<i>that examines theories</i>
<i>about how humans</i>
<i>come to experience</i>
<i>a singular emotion.</i>
<i>In its original form</i>
<i>it was presented</i>
<i>as a work of fiction.</i>
<i>We will interrupt the fim</i>
<i>How Would You Feel?</i>
<i> from time to time</i>
<i>with a new film entitled</i>
<i>An Oversimplification</i>
<i>of Her Beauty.</i>
<i>We will do this in order</i>
<i>to provide the context</i>
<i>necessary to tell</i>
<i> a complete story.</i>
<i>So let's say that one day</i>
<i>you arrive at your home.</i>
<i>It has been a long day,</i>
<i> during which you have wod</i>
<i>no less than</i>
<i>12 consecutive hours.</i>
<i>This is in your case</i>
<i>a typical day.</i>
<i>However, this particulary</i>
<i> a young lady who you know</i>
<i>and a little more than like</i>
<i>has told you that</i>
<i> she is coming to be in</i>
<i> your company this evenin.</i>
<i>So as you empty your pocs</i>
<i> and begin to get settled,</i>
<i>you see that</i>
<i>she has telephoned you.</i>
<i> (VIBRATING)</i>
<i>Of course you</i>
<i>telephone her back.</i>
<i>She answers.</i>
<i>She tells you that</i>
<i>she has just arrived</i>
<i>at her own home</i>
<i>and won't be coming</i>
<i> to yours tonight.</i>
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>given the circumstances,</i>
<i>how would you feel?</i>
<i>Now let's say that</i>
<i>this particular day</i>
<i>began at 8:00 a.m.,</i>
<i>when you woke up too late</i>
<i> to arrive at your place</i>
<i> of employment on time.</i>
<i>Your daily commute</i>
<i>is no less than one hour.</i>
<i>Although you arrive on tim,</i>
<i>you are disappointed</i>
<i>in your inability</i>
<i>to awake yourself  consistently</i>
<i>in situations when</i>
<i>you are in a bed alone.</i>
<i>You are disappointed</i>
<i>because this disability speaks</i>
<i>to a lack of self-control.</i>
<i>Self-control that</i>
<i>you feel entitled to,</i>
<i>but do not possess.</i>
<i>The evening before</i>
<i> you worked late</i>
<i>and consequently</i>
<i>slept for only three hours.</i>
<i>And let's say that</i>
<i> you have no bed</i>
<i> and no money,</i>
<i>and a stubborn yet quixoc</i>
<i> do-it-yourself attitude.</i>
<i>So, you built your bed</i>
<i>in a wood shop</i>
<i>using Japanese wood</i>
<i> joinery techniques</i>
<i>that you learned</i>
<i>from a book you</i>
<i>found in the garbage.</i>
<i>You possess no means</i>
<i>of personal transportation,</i>
<i>so you elected</i>
<i>to transport this bed,</i>
<i>piece by piece,</i>
<i>on the train ride home,</i>
<i>rushing yourself</i>
<i> because you expected</i>
<i>to be in the company</i>
<i>of this lady quite soon.</i>
<i>After all, she has told you</i>
<i>she would be in your</i>
<i>company this evening.</i>
<i>So, you empty your</i>
<i>pockets, get settled,</i>
<i>and notice you have</i>
<i>missed her call.</i>
<i>You call her back.</i>
<i>She tells you</i>
<i> she has just arrived</i>
<i> at her own home</i>
<i>and won't be</i>
<i>seeing you tonight.</i>
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>given the circumstances,</i>
<i>how would you feel?</i>
<i>Now, let's just say</i>
<i>that over the span</i>
<i>of four to eight weeks,</i>
<i>this young lady</i>
<i> has become a very</i>
<i> good friend of yours.</i>
BOTH NARRATORS:
<i>This friendship is platoni.</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>Let's say that</i>
<i> you are attracted to her.</i>
<i>You do not know</i>
<i> if she, in the deep</i>
<i> recesses of her soul,</i>
<i>harbors any amorous</i>
<i>feelings for you</i>
<i>as you do for her.</i>
<i>But when parting from</i>
<i>each other's presence,</i>
<i>she lightly kisses you</i>
<i>on your lips.</i>
<i>Seldom, but with intenti,</i>
<i>and a hint of mischief</i>
<i>and doubt opaque</i>
<i>in her pupils.</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>Let's say</i>
<i> you and this lady friend</i>
<i> have slept together</i>
<i>on between four</i>
<i>and 18 occasions.</i>
<i>And by "slept together"</i>
<i>I mean just that, sleeping.</i>
<i>Each occasion occurs</i>
<i>in either one of</i>
<i>your full-sized beds.</i>
<i>Each time you</i>
<i>share a bed, you grow</i>
<i>closer physically,</i>
<i>until you cannot</i>
<i>get any closer.</i>
<i>And let's say that</i>
<i>this growth seems</i>
<i>mutually fulfilling.</i>
<i>It is gentle, subtle,</i>
<i> but fortunately it is</i>
<i> accelerating in intensit.</i>
<i>Of course, each</i>
<i>morning after and for</i>
<i>varying lengths of time</i>
<i>during the days between</i>
<i>these encounters...</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>...you daydream</i>
<i>about this most enigmatic</i>
<i>of connections.</i>
<i>You allow the taste</i>
<i>of your time together</i>
<i>to linger in your mouth</i>
<i>and coat your hands.</i>
<i>You think of the food</i>
<i> you cook together</i>
<i>and the way her navel</i>
<i>feels against your fingert.</i>
<i>A sweetness prevails.</i>
<i>Today, during</i>
<i>your frustration with</i>
<i>your bed, your income,</i>
<i>and your commute,</i>
<i>you found respite</i>
<i>in the fact that</i>
<i>on that particular...</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>Evening you</i>
<i> would have the opportuniy</i>
<i> to be in her company.</i>
<i>You would have been</i>
<i>uplifted by just the thougt</i>
<i>of spending this time</i>
<i>with this woman.</i>
<i>The night before</i>
<i>you are to meet</i>
<i>this young lady,</i>
<i>you dream a dream</i>
<i> that you remember.</i>
<i>Seldom do you</i>
<i>remember your dreams.</i>
<i>In this dream you ascend</i>
<i>above your existence</i>
<i>and shed among other</i>
<i>things a Western</i>
<i>understanding of time.</i>
<i>You meet her in a sky.</i>
<i>She has taken</i>
<i>the form of a sun,</i>
<i>but does not emit heat.</i>
<i>You ask for the time.</i>
<i>She refers you to</i>
<i>a moon who unfortunately</i>
<i>does not have the same</i>
<i>gravitational pull as she.</i>
<i>You fall from the sky</i>
<i> and are awakened</i>
<i> by your alarm</i>
<i>too late to arrive at yor</i>
<i> place of employment on t.</i>
<i>Let's say that</i>
<i> this frustrates you</i>
<i>because it evidences</i>
<i>a lack of self-control.</i>
<i>You also overslept</i>
<i>because in an exercise</i>
<i>in self-discipline,</i>
<i>you worked much</i>
<i>later than usual,</i>
<i>attempting to meet</i>
<i>your daily income quota.</i>
<i>After work you finished</i>
<i>the remaining pieces</i>
<i>of your bed.</i>
<i>Incidentally,</i>
<i>the bed did not fit</i>
<i>together quite right</i>
<i>because you are not</i>
<i>a very good carpenter,</i>
<i>nor do you read Japanese.</i>
<i>When you brought</i>
<i>it home, you stood</i>
<i>on the train platform</i>
<i>and watched</i>
<i>three full trains pass...</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>...each</i>
<i>more full than the next.</i>
<i>People pushed themselves</i>
<i>against each other.</i>
<i>You imagined a collective</i>
<i> amorous feeling</i>
<i> floating in the air,</i>
<i>even though there</i>
<i>wasn't enough room</i>
<i>for you and your bed.</i>
BOTH NARRATORS: <i>Still, you</i>
<i> rushed yourself home, wih</i>
<i> this woman in your head.</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>And as you</i>
<i>get settled, you see that</i>
<i>you have missed her call.</i>
Hello.
<i>You call back.</i>
<i>She says that</i>
<i>she has just arrived</i>
<i>at her own home</i>
<i>and will not be</i>
<i> seeing you tonight.</i>
<i>(INAUDIBLE)</i>
<i>Now at that moment,</i>
<i>given the circumstances,</i>
<i>how would you feel?</i>
<i>Now, let's say that</i>
<i>in life you are not</i>
<i>chronically lonely...</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>...but the vast</i>
<i> majority of your days and</i>
<i> nights are spent alone.</i>
<i>All the same usually,</i>
<i>because you are very busy.</i>
<i>Busy with finishing</i>
<i> your education...</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>...so that</i>
<i>you can finish</i>
<i>knowing who you are,</i>
<i>so that you can finish</i>
<i>with those years in life</i>
<i>during which you have</i>
<i>no clear answer</i>
<i>to the question...</i>
NARRATOR 2:
<i>"What do you do?"</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>Generally</i>
<i> speaking, with</i>
<i> a few notable exceptions,</i>
<i>those that desire  your company</i>
<i>do not interest you</i>
<i>in a way</i>
<i>that would provoke you</i>
<i>to set aside time</i>
<i> to engage them.</i>
<i>Those that do interest y,</i>
<i> those for whom you would</i>
<i> manufacture time,</i>
<i>do not live in your vicinity,</i>
<i>or do not seem</i>
<i>so interested in you</i>
<i>as you in them.</i>
<i>And let's say that a womn</i>
<i> who you are presently</i>
<i> in love with</i>
<i>has decided</i>
<i>to enter an exclusive</i>
<i>romantic relationship</i>
<i>with someone</i>
<i> who provides for her</i>
<i>the stability and maturity</i>
<i>that you cannot.</i>
<i>You marvel</i>
<i> at the contradiction</i>
<i>between the intensity</i>
<i> of your love for her</i>
<i>and your in ability</i>
<i> to accurately express</i>
<i> this same love.</i>
<i>You wonder aloud</i>
<i> when you will grow diffet</i>
<i>and occasionally</i>
<i>allow yourself to wallow</i>
<i>in this gingerly</i>
<i>debilitating self-doubt.</i>
<i>Now, let's say</i>
<i> that at this very moment,</i>
<i>you were introduced</i>
<i>to this young lady</i>
<i>by a mutual friend.</i>
<i>You quickly crafted a ren</i>
<i> to work closely with her.</i>
<i>You collaborated</i>
<i>on designs for T-shirts.</i>
<i>You became good friends,</i>
<i>real friends</i>
<i>with inside jokes</i>
<i>and clear recollection</i>
<i>of the intricacies</i>
<i>of each other's body odor</i>
<i>even when apart.</i>
<i>You were, from the very moment</i>
<i>you laid your eyes</i>
<i>inside her eyes,</i>
<i>intensely attracted to her.</i>
<i>You don't have much</i>
<i>self-control and you acted</i>
<i>clearly on this attraction.</i>
<i>Let's say that for a good</i>
<i> while, she entertained</i>
<i> your flirtatious advances</i>
<i>with the timbre and grace</i>
<i> of someone with mutual</i>
<i> romantic feelings.</i>
<i>Let's say that</i>
<i>this went on for</i>
<i>between four to eight week,</i>
<i>and during this time</i>
<i>facilitated</i>
<i>a concrete attachment,</i>
<i>grounded in a sincere care</i>
<i>for this young lady's</i>
<i>wellbeing and peace of min.</i>
<i>This care and concern,</i>
<i>possibly one-sided,</i>
<i>but at the least entertad</i>
<i> by her words and actions,</i>
<i>went unchecked</i>
<i>and flourished</i>
<i>in a direction</i>
<i>clearly departing the platonc</i>
<i>in pursuit of the romantic.</i>
<i>One evening,</i>
<i>maybe not at the height</i>
<i>of the aforementioned</i>
<i>flourishing,</i>
<i>but at some point</i>
<i>when it was steadily growi,</i>
<i>let's say this young lady</i>
<i>friend reveals to you</i>
<i>that she is engaged</i>
<i>in an exclusive</i>
<i>romantic relationship</i>
<i>with a young man</i>
<i>whom she has</i>
<i>described to you</i>
<i>as both charismatic and caring.</i>
<i>She directly tells you</i>
<i>that his charisma only kees</i>
<i>her periodically content,</i>
<i>and he is thus forced</i>
<i>to compensate for this</i>
<i>in a variety of ways.</i>
<i>Also, from both her complaints</i>
<i>and your observations</i>
<i>of their relationship,</i>
<i>you note that although</i>
<i>you are completely differet</i>
<i>from this young man</i>
<i>in both sensibility</i>
<i>and style,</i>
<i>you are likely</i>
<i>to meet a similar,</i>
<i>if not identical fate.</i>
<i>When she tells you this,</i>
<i>you perform some simple</i>
<i>arithmetic and conclude</i>
<i>that she has been withholdg</i>
<i>this information from you</i>
<i>for between four</i>
<i>and eight weeks.</i>
<i>Let's say that in</i>
<i> one of your moments</i>
<i> of acute self-awareness,</i>
<i>you admit to yourself</i>
<i> that you knew all along..</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>...about</i>
<i>her exclusive</i>
<i>romantic relationship.</i>
<i>She was, indeed,</i>
<i>not adept at hiding it.</i>
<i>You, of course, chose to</i>
<i> ignore it, telling yoursf</i>
<i> that her and her boyfried</i>
<i>must have an agreement</i>
<i>or understanding</i>
<i>that would allow</i>
<i>for relationships just like</i>
<i>the one you have with her.</i>
<i>You told yourself</i>
<i> this was the case</i>
<i>no matter how implausible</i>
<i>that inference was.</i>
<i>Their relationship aside,</i>
<i>you focus on the fact</i>
<i>that you perceive her</i>
<i>to be attracted to you.</i>
<i>She has yet to say as mu,</i>
<i>but let's say that after</i>
<i>the initial hardship</i>
<i>that the news</i>
<i>of her exclusive romantic</i>
<i>relationship brought about,</i>
<i>your rapport with this lady</i>
<i>friend eases back into</i>
<i>the way that it was before,</i>
<i>and your relationship</i>
<i>is now augmented</i>
<i>with quotation marks,</i>
<i>to illustrate the fragility...</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>...and</i>
<i> moral destitution</i>
<i> of the situation.</i>
<i>And let's say that this is</i>
<i>the current state of affairs</i>
<i>when you experience this day.</i>
<i>Again, not the best of day.</i>
<i>You wake up slightly late,</i>
<i>you arrive to work late,</i>
<i>you to stay later</i>
<i>out of guilt, and</i>
<i>subsequently you are late</i>
<i>for a course</i>
<i> you are enrolled in.</i>
<i>When you arrive,</i>
<i>the professor looks</i>
<i>at you coldly and says,</i>
<i>"You should have been here"</i>
<i>You do, however,</i>
<i> manage to finish</i>
<i> building and transporting</i>
<i>the last few pieces</i>
<i> of your bed.</i>
<i>Unfortunately, the bed</i>
<i> does not function propery</i>
<i>because you made it</i>
<i>out of pine,</i>
<i>which is a soft wood.</i>
<i>For the proper strength</i>
<i>required for a sturdy bed,</i>
<i>you would have</i>
<i> needed a hard wood,</i>
<i>like maple, oak, or mahogany.</i>
<i>Of course, you rush home.</i>
<i>Kids on the train</i>
<i>often tease you</i>
<i>because of the length</i>
<i>of your hair.</i>
<i>You are amused.</i>
<i>You are shamefully dirty</i>
<i>because you have not</i>
<i>showered, shaved,</i>
<i>or applied deodorant</i>
<i> in two days.</i>
<i>When you get home,</i>
<i>you realize that you have left</i>
<i>your apartment in disarray</i>
<i>because you have</i>
<i>not had time to clean it.</i>
<i>You, of course, were</i>
<i> planning to clean for ths</i>
<i> occasion with this lady.</i>
<i>You start to get settled.</i>
<i>You notice that</i>
<i>she has telephoned you.</i>
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>you telephone her back.</i>
<i>She tells you that</i>
<i>she has herself just</i>
<i>arrived at her own home</i>
<i>and will not be able</i>
<i> to come and see you toni.</i>
<i>Now, at that moment,</i>
<i>given the aforementioned</i>
<i>circumstances,</i>
<i>how would you feel?</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>During your</i>
<i> romance wi</i>(BLEEP)
<i>you were reading a book.</i>
(NARRATION PLAYING BACKWARDS)
(NARRATOR READING)
<i>The book tells the story</i>
<i>of</i> (BLEEP) <i>and</i> (BLEEP)

<i>to fall in love with him.</i>
<i>This all takes place</i>
<i>on a</i> (BLEEP) <i>reservation</i>

What page is it?
TERENCE: 90 something...
Early 90s.
Okay.
It says...
<i>"I felt him looking at me.</i>
<i>"It's what happens</i>
<i> with boys like him.</i>
<i>"Less said, more felt.</i>
<i>"He was bad at that</i>

<i>"You always know</i>
<i>when they are</i>
<i>looking your way,</i>
<i>"when if you return</i>

<i>"The smooth ones</i>
<i>either keep looking at you,</i>
<i>or subtly divert their eye.</i>
<i>"Boys like him turn away</i>
<i> because they can imagineu</i>
<i>"being wherever</i>
<i> they are looking.</i>
"I was dancing,
and in so doing,
<i>"paying close attention</i>
<i>to the exciting realities</i>
<i>of my flesh.</i>
<i>"Probably more attention</i>
<i>than</i> (BLEEP)
<i>"where on me</i>
<i>was exposed to the air."</i>
That's right?
TERENCE: Yeah,
that's the part.
Okay...
<i>"Here on the res,</i>
<i>it was pretty easy</i>
<i>"for them to set up</i>
<i>a lot for the picture show.</i>
<i>"Going to the picture show,</i>
<i>along with the bingo,</i>
<i>"was maybe the only</i>
<i>indulgence we were afforded</i>
<i>in Western entertainment,</i>
<i>"that and the firewater."</i>
Have we ever been
to the movies together?
TERENCE: <i>Uh,</i>
<i>I don't remember</i>
NAMIK: <i>Hmm, so...</i>
<i>"The pleasant movies always</i>
<i>gave soft edges to things</i>
<i>"and had colors placed</i>
<i> in locales unfamiliar to.</i>
<i>"Yellow roses,</i>
<i>bright brown eyes,</i>
<i>stark white pigeon.</i>
<i>"Being around him</i>

<i>"Nevertheless,</i>

OLD WOMAN: No. Well,
this is not the...
I thought you was
looking for a Lucille.
But... Someone...
One of May's children.
But, no.
Maybe you have
the wrong number.
No, but feel free to call back.
<i>Whoever you're looking for</i>
<i>might be coming here,</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>But who.</i>(LAUGHS)
But I can't understand
who you say
you're looking for.
Uh-huh. Bye-bye.
(HANGS UP PHONE)
NAMIK: <i>"Pessimism,</i>
<i>practicality, cynicism,</i>
<i>realism, comfort zones,</i>
<i>"I'm actually</i>
<i>against all these things.</i>
"But at least with him,
I still act on them."
No, none of this is like me.
NARRATOR 1: <i>Would you</i>
<i> feel vexed? Slightly irk,</i>
<i> confused or confuddled?</i>
<i>Exasperated? Displeased?</i>
<i>Remorseful?</i>
<i> Worn or withered?</i>
BOTH NARRATORS:
<i>Heartbroken? Defeated?</i>
<i>Piled upon? Suckered?</i>
<i>Cheated? Discarded?</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>Unloved?</i>
<i> Envious? Enraged? Ignore?</i>
<i>Small? Tiny? Microscopic?</i>
<i>Atomic? Quantum? Eternal?</i>
<i>Embarrassed?</i>
<i> Indecisive? Ashamed?</i>
<i>Amused?</i>

<i>Take a moment to ascertain</i>
<i>how you would feel</i>

NARRATOR 1: <i>Why would</i>
<i> you feel these ways?</i>
<i>Close your eyes</i>
<i>and track the source</i>
<i>of the feelings. Go on.</i>
<i>"Pain," you say?</i>
<i>A subtle pain?</i>
<i>Interesting...</i>
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
<i>Maybe you are feeling the pain</i>
<i>that lies in the void</i>
<i>between expectations</i>
<i> and reality.</i>
<i>Maybe the unnamable emotn</i>
<i> you are feeling that eveg</i>
<i>is, as emotions tend to be,</i>
<i>entirely irrational.</i>
<i>An organism without reason.</i>
<i>Insecurity, for instance,</i>
<i>that parasite</i>
<i>has got the best of you.</i>
<i>This series of events</i>
<i>is not the cause</i>
<i>of your momentary feeling.</i>
<i>It cannot be that.</i>
<i>Consider the emotions.</i>
<i>What actually happend</i>
<i> is not important.</i>
<i>What you must take note of</i>
<i>is the self-doubt,</i>
<i>the void between</i>
<i> who you actually are</i>
<i> and who you think you ar.</i>
<i>The void between</i>
<i>how you actually feel</i>
<i>and how she thinks you fee.</i>
<i>The void between</i>
<i>your perception</i>
<i>of your capacity to love</i>
<i>and your actual skill set</i>
<i>in this regard.</i>
<i>Maybe it's your</i>
<i> self-assuredness.</i>
<i>You have an extraordinary</i>
<i>amount of faith</i>
<i>in the fidelity</i>
<i> of your expectations.</i>
<i>Emotions should be expressed.</i>
<i>If the cause of your</i>
<i> momentary feelings are</i>
<i> simply irrational emotio,</i>
<i>you need to release them,</i>
<i>let them go.</i>
<i>Write out the events</i>
<i>of the evening in detail.</i>
<i>Review the details,</i>
<i>consider their absurdity,</i>
<i>connect your emotional se</i>
<i> to a series of actions</i>
<i>performed by people</i>
<i> whom you can blame.</i>
<i>Blame yourself, blame he.</i>
<i>Debunk the rationality</i>
<i>of these connections.</i>
<i>Sleep, wake up,</i>
<i>draw a few images</i>
<i>that illustrate how you feel.</i>
<i>Do not finish.</i>
<i>Draw until you</i>
<i>feel lighter.</i>
<i>Write more,  sleep, wake up.</i>
<i>Entertain the idea of calling</i>
<i>her and telling her you</i>
<i>are madly in love with her.</i>
<i>Let the impulse pass,</i>
<i> cower from it.</i>
<i>Most likely the heartache</i>
<i>from the previous night,</i>
<i>a physiological symptom</i>
<i>of your feelings,</i>
<i>has yet to fade.</i>
<i>Allow this to amuse you.</i>
<i>It's funny</i>
<i>if you think about it.</i>
<i>The un-wielding grip</i>
<i> your emotions have</i>
<i> on your physical wellbei.</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>What follows</i>
<i>is a brief exegesis in</i>
<i>which we explain</i>
<i>the nature of your</i>
<i>relationships with those</i>
<i>with whom you are in love</i>
<i>as of the completion</i>
<i> of this film.</i>
<i>You met Najja</i>
<i> when she was born.</i>
<i>This was shortly</i>
<i>after your own birth.</i>
<i>Currently,</i>
<i>you do not see her</i>
<i>because of the distance.</i>
<i>The aforementioned ambivalene</i>
<i>ruined your relationship.</i>
<i>You were at a time</i>
<i>in your life where you were</i>
<i>incapable of being direct.</i>
<i>She was, at the time,</i>
<i>a far more evolved</i>
<i>being than you,</i>
<i>and was repelled</i>
<i>by both your inability</i>
<i>to reciprocate affection</i>
<i>and speak clearly</i>
<i>about your feelings,</i>
<i>no matter  their implications.</i>
<i>You and Joy, although fuy</i>
<i> in love, have not attempd</i>
<i> a committed relationship</i>
<i>because of the fact</i>
<i> that you do not reside</i>
<i> in the same municipality.</i>
<i>However, you hypothesize</i>
<i>that the cause</i>
<i>of your separation</i>
<i>may be more so because</i>
<i> you are too sure of</i>
<i> the connection's viabili.</i>
<i>A commitment to</i>
<i>a woman with whom you</i>
<i>are so intensely compatible</i>
<i>would leave you</i>
<i>with nothing else</i>
<i>to search for,</i>
<i>rendering your distance</i>
<i>from her a product</i>
<i>of your addiction</i>
<i>to the unpredictability</i>
<i>of your feast-and-famine</i>
<i>romantic existence.</i>
<i>On a more pragmatic leve,</i>
<i> Joy may just not</i>
<i> be that into you.</i>
(BLOWING)
(SNIFFING)
<i>At first you think</i>
<i>you do not see Qrescent</i>
<i>because she is</i>
<i>no longer interested</i>
<i>in you romantically.</i>
<i>Your ego pushes that</i>
<i> thought from your head,</i>
<i> and you convince yourself</i>
<i>that the nature</i>
<i>of her relationship</i>
<i>with her girlfriend</i>
<i>does not allow for</i>
<i>you all to maintain</i>
<i>a romantic relationship.</i>
<i>You infer,</i>
<i>that she is in a blissful</i>
<i>place, where some combination</i>
<i>of disinterest in you</i>
<i>and enchantment</i>
<i>with her new relationship</i>
<i>inspires her to maintain</i>
<i>an un-traversable</i>
<i> distance between her</i>
<i>and you.</i>
<i>Unfortunately, you have not</i>
<i>mastered the art of sustaining</i>
<i>platonic arrangements</i>
<i>in the midst of</i>
<i> extreme romantic attract.</i>
<i>All of the rational you</i>
<i> formulate to explain her</i>
<i> current disinterest in yu</i>
<i>is simply a way</i>
<i>of ignoring your</i>
<i>many faults.</i>
<i>The armor of stoicism</i>
<i>you wear when</i>
<i>you are in love.</i>
<i>Your inability to</i>
<i>commit in simple ways,</i>
<i>commit to visiting</i>
<i> or calling, commit</i>
<i> to being honest.</i>
<i>Most of these faults</i>
<i>played a large part in</i>
<i>the current state of affairs.</i>
<i>Her new relationship</i>
<i>and its blinding beauty</i>
<i>is an easy scapegoat</i>
<i>on which to pin the blame</i>
<i>of your current separation.</i>
<i>You will concede to</i>
<i>any rationale in order</i>
<i>to avoid the fact that</i>
<i>somewhere inside you,</i>
<i>you know that</i>
<i>she may simply</i>
<i>not love you anymore.</i>
WOMAN: <i>Hey, you leaving?</i>
MAN: <i>Me?</i>
<i>I would never leav.</i>
<i>But I am shrinking</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>Kamo lives</i>
<i>on another hemisphere.</i>
<i>You long for the idea</i>
<i>that she longs for you.</i>
<i>She was your first.</i>
<i>You wonder what number</i>
<i>you are for her.</i>
(MAN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)
<i>Kudzai lives in</i>
<i> another hemisphere,</i>
<i>and most likely</i>
<i>has forgotten</i>
<i>that you exist.</i>
(WIND WHOOSHING)
<i>In your non-existence,</i>
<i>your dreams take hold.</i>
<i>They are very powerful.</i>
<i>So powerful, in fact,</i>
<i>that you often miss</i>
<i>things you never had.</i>
<i>You intensely miss</i>
<i>your yearlong courtship</i>
<i>with her,</i>
<i>even though</i>
<i>it may have never existed.</i>
NARRATOR 1:
<i>Let's talk about reality.</i>
<i>There are elements</i>
<i>of this hypothetical</i>
<i>situation that are tangibl.</i>
<i>They can touch you</i>
<i> and can be touched.</i>
<i>Unlike your emotions,</i>
<i> they are inescapable.</i>
<i>These elements are as follows.</i>
<i>Number one. You are</i>
<i>emotionally unavailable,</i>
<i>a symptom of</i>
<i> the post-traumatic stress</i>
<i> of a previous relationsh.</i>
<i>How you feel is not a ret</i>
<i> of any series of events,</i>
<i>or an irrational</i>
<i> emotion fabricated in orr</i>
<i> to distract yourself...</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>...from</i>
<i> the necessity of addressg</i>
<i> your immaturity.</i>
<i>This circumstance</i>
<i> is the cause.</i>
<i>It is unavoidable.</i>
<i>So the night greets</i>
<i>you with sleep you</i>
<i>do not deserve but need,</i>
<i>and loneliness</i>
<i>you have imposed</i>
<i>upon yourself</i>
<i>but do not deserve.</i>
<i>The reality is</i>
<i>that she is gone.</i>
<i>You were not available,</i>
<i>so she left.</i>
<i>Number 2.</i>
<i>The time spent releasing,</i>
<i>writing, making films with her,</i>
<i>painting her with light,</i>
<i>shall we say,</i>
<i>was an insufficient</i>
<i> substitute...</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>...for</i>
<i>spending time with her</i>
<i>in a social setting.</i>
<i>You cannot replace</i>
<i>those circumstances</i>
<i>with these.</i>
<i>There is little joy</i>
<i> in this new space,</i>
<i>mostly quiet smiles and</i>
<i>internal musings about</i>
<i>what you should have</i>
<i>said or done</i>
<i>during the moments</i>
<i> you are reenacting.</i>
<i>Number three.</i>
<i>In reality, you cannot</i>
<i>write about the situation</i>
<i>without recalling</i>
<i>the emotions it provoked.</i>
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>the painful ones</i>
<i>reconstitute themselves</i>
<i>the most firmly,</i>
<i>brutally beating all the</i>
<i>endless conversations and</i>
<i>comfortable silences.</i>
(WOMAN SPEAKING)
<i>The shame and pain</i>
<i>do not erase</i>
<i>the beauty entirely,</i>
<i>but the beauty stays clear</i>
<i>of whatever emotions find</i>
<i>their way onto the page.</i>
<i>What remains</i>
<i>is what bludgeoned you,</i>
<i>confused you,</i>
<i>shamed you,</i>
<i>and emasculated you.</i>
WOMAN: <i>I'm in</i>
<i>an exclusive</i>
<i>romantic relationship.</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>Number four.</i>
BOTH NARRATORS: <i>In reality,</i>
<i> chance does not often</i>
<i> fall on your side.</i>
<i>You do not believe in luck</i>
<i>per se, but inevitably, as</i>
<i>you begin to write this story,</i>
<i>your pen will run out of i,</i>
<i>your bed will break,</i>
<i>you will kiss her</i>
<i>with certainty and not dou.</i>
<i>She will turn you away.</i>
<i>You will never disclose</i>
<i>your feelings. She will</i>
<i>find someone new.</i>
<i>You will imagine her in</i>
<i> your bed at night. She wl</i>
<i> occupy someone else's.</i>
<i>She will find someone el.</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>In reality,</i>
<i>she will hurt you</i>
<i>with her silence,</i>
<i>her quiet enigmatic beauty,</i>
<i>her impenetrable stare,</i>
<i>it's blankness,</i>
<i>it's indecipherability,</i>
<i>it's taste.</i>
BOTH NARRATORS: <i>You will</i>
<i> become distracted again,</i>
<i> walk into her magic.</i>
<i>You will kiss her with l.</i>
<i> She will turn you away.</i>
<i>She will find someone new,</i>
<i>who will watch her, watch you,</i>
<i>tell her how you feel.</i>
<i>You will watch her not car.</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>In defense,</i>
<i>you will forget what happened.</i>
<i>You will forget her mind,</i>
<i>her mother's name,</i>
<i>her favorite color, her orisha</i>
<i>her laugh, her smell.</i>
<i>You will continue to wri,</i>
<i> ignorant, forgetful.</i>
<i>You will oversimplify</i>
<i>her beauty.</i>
<i>You will revise her</i>
<i>without her edges.</i>
<i>In reality, you love</i>
<i> this simple version of h.</i>
<i> She is familiar,</i>
<i>benign. You will speak to the</i>
<i>real her again. Before doing</i>
<i>so, you will prepare yourself,</i>
<i>pray the new her seems</i>
<i>the same as the old her.</i>
<i>She tells you she is</i>
<i>in an exclusive</i>
<i>romantic relationship</i>
<i>with a young man whom</i>
<i>she likes quite a bit.</i>
<i>You retreat,</i>
<i>keep your distance,</i>
<i>she catches your eye as</i>
<i>you pray to a Western god</i>
<i>for a closeness with her,</i>
<i>a shared secret,</i>
<i>a kiss, a hug, a child,</i>
<i>a family, a fight,</i>
<i>one where you make up</i>
<i>and make another child.</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>You are</i>
<i>floating involuntarily</i>
<i>toward her magic.</i>
<i>You will tire  of this dance.</i>
<i>But never so much</i>
<i>as to disengage with it,</i>
<i>turn off the music.</i>
<i>Even though you know</i>
<i> that you should.</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>Even though</i>
<i> it may have never existe.</i>
What are you doing?
NARRATOR 1: <i>One's identity</i>
<i>is most often bound</i>
<i>in the objectifying eye</i>
<i>of the beholder,</i>
<i>even if one finds themselves</i>
<i>beholding themselves.</i>
<i>Thus, disposition and identity</i>
<i>are entirely defined by</i>
<i>individual interpretation.</i>
<i>We will call</i>
<i>this phenomenon</i>
<i>"the lens."</i>
<i>For this exercise,</i>
<i> you must imagine</i>
<i> an entirely</i>
<i>unfiltered and unapologec</i>
<i> view of yourself.</i>
<i>This self-awareness</i>
<i> is necessary</i>
<i>in order for us</i>
<i>to formulate</i>
<i>accurate conclusions.</i>
<i>We need accurate facts</i>
<i>about who you are</i>
<i>and the idiosyncrasies tt</i>
<i> define an independent yo.</i>
<i>These facts are as follows...</i>
<i>And note,</i>
<i> like a list of ingredien,</i>
<i>the component that dominats</i>
<i>the very simple formula</i>
<i>is listed first.</i>
<i>So first, them.</i>
<i>The sight of</i>
<i>a certain type of woman</i>
<i>causes you to stumble.</i>
<i>She is most often brown,</i>
<i>maternal, well-read,</i>
<i> well-traveled,</i>
<i>and capable of holding</i>
<i>a note or playing</i>
<i>an instrument.</i>
<i>By the grace of the goddes,</i>
<i>this archetype</i>
<i>usually takes notice</i>
<i>of you in a way</i>
<i>that would divert</i>
<i>their attention from</i>
<i>your clumsiness.</i>
<i>Often, their attention is</i>
<i>diverted long enough</i>
<i>for you to</i>
<i> come across composed</i>
<i>and even intention-less.</i>
<i>These moments are</i>
<i> few and far between,</i>
<i>so capitalization is a mus.</i>
<i>Rule number two, never, ever</i>
<i>let a beautiful person</i>
<i>pass you by.</i>
(SAD COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)
<i>You are meditative</i>
<i> and masochistic</i>
<i>in a way that facilitates</i>
<i> your creative functional.</i>
<i>You like the poetics</i>
<i> of sad songs more.</i>
<i>You are, shall we say,</i>
<i>more enamored</i>
<i> with the bad news.</i>
<i>Third,</i>
<i>your hope and idealism</i>
<i>stem from a far-gone reali,</i>
<i>a childhood</i>
<i>that took place</i>
<i>in a community</i>
<i>that provided a wealth</i>
<i>of love, knowledge,</i>
<i>and support.</i>
<i>You are supremely</i>
<i>privileged in the sense</i>
<i>that you were,</i>
<i>throughout your childhoo,</i>
<i> provided with</i>
<i> a pristinely healthy</i>
<i>emotional environment.</i>
<i>Your childhood was</i>
<i> conspicuously void of an,</i>
<i>conflict, and repression.</i>
<i>Thus, the trace amounts</i>
<i>that are present now</i>
<i>have a profound effect</i>
<i>on your emotional dispositio.</i>
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)
<i>Number four.</i>
<i>You assume a persona of</i>
<i>ambivalence, aloofness,</i>
<i>and at times stoicism</i>
<i>in matters of love.</i>
<i>You assume this persona</i>
<i>as a means of</i>
<i>attracting women.</i>
<i>It seems to work out better</i>
<i>if they believe you to be</i>
<i> calm under the pressure</i>
<i> of heated attraction.</i>
<i>This behavioral mask</i>
<i> has been the direct cause</i>
<i> of three discrete</i>
<i>and meaningful happenings</i>
<i>and/or experiences in</i>
<i>this hypothetical situatio.</i>
<i>The first of these</i>
<i>happenings is something</i>
<i>that did not happen.</i>
<i>You have not been able</i>
<i>to tell her</i>
<i>how you feel about</i>
<i>the relationship directly</i>
<i>until of, course,</i>
<i> the short film</i>
<i> How Would You Feel?</i>
<i>Was finished</i>
<i> and subsequently screened</i>
<i> for the public.</i>
(LAUGHING)
I feel pretty strange.
(LAUGHING)
No. I mean,
it's weird.
How many people
do you say that to?
It's not really
a normal situation.
It's normal.
I have a bit of a...
I generally avoid the fact
in conversation
and direct interaction.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Well, if you don't know
what to do with it,
you might misuse it
or abuse it or...
Or enjoy it.
They're all
dangerous things.
Because enjoying it, you let go
and give yourself in to it,
which is completely
an uncontrollable thing.
So...
So...
To not be in control,
for people that like
to be in control, is
risky, dangerous.
Not so good always.
(LAUGHING)
It was definitely weird
to see on
a big screen in front
of other people.
Maybe if they didn't
know me, that was cool.
But I happened to see it
for the first time
in a screening
with a whole bunch
of my friends,
who happen to know
all about you, Terence,
and some of our situation.
They've heard stories.
I've told them stories.
MAN: <i>I take it that</i>
<i>the movie seems</i>
<i>to be a critique</i>
<i>or an invitation to</i>
<i>revisit the notion of...</i>
(CAMERA CLICKS)
Of having exclusive,
special love.
So, the notion of
being able to love
or being romantically
involved with
more than one person.
But, nevertheless,
every single one
of them is special.
Mmm. Well, um...
(ALL CHUCKLING)
I completely agree.
You know what I mean?
But I think...
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
As explained in the film,
especially that
conversation at the end,
it's just, like, really
a rumination on
how relationships
or how each relationship
is so intricately
defined by the
circumstances around it.
At times.
Nothing.
So...
No, I felt
uncomfortable because
certain private
interactions were publicized,
and mainly from
one point of view.
If we both got to have
our little commentary,
a little dual-screen
action,
it would have been
a different story.
And it's your film,
that's fine.
But it was like my life
put on screen to
your music.
It's apparent to me that
you make movies
about your life.
No, everyone doesn't.
You feel bad?
That's true.
The only problem is that
your truth will never
make you feel bad.
Hopefully.
But it's definite.
It's a definite fact that
everyone has their own truths.
And that's
the eternal cause
of conflict,
and it's not really negotiable.
Like, everyone sees
the world through
their own eyes,
so to see it through
someone else's eyes,
but still have it
be an experience that
you remember is
a jarring experience
sometimes
if it doesn't coalesce
into my truth.
(LAUGHS) Is it?
Is
coming to theaters this fall.
TERENCE: <i>Oh!</i>
<i> (NAMIK LAUGHING)</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>Your silence</i>
<i>in regards to your feelings</i>
<i>was not absolute.</i>
<i>On two or three occasions</i>
<i> you did write her</i>
<i> short-form poetry,</i>
<i>mostly sent via text message,</i>
<i>saying things like...</i>
TERENCE: <i>"I want to</i>
<i> speak to you in a languae</i>
<i>"that only you understan"</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>And...</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>"Where on Earth</i>
<i> can you tell the truth</i>
<i>"without negative</i>
<i> consequences?</i>
<i>"Esoteric and ultimately</i>
<i>meaningless, I know."</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>Before making</i>
<i> the film, you did write r</i>
<i> one rather loaded letter.</i>
<i>In it, you reveal that</i>
<i> when you leave her prese,</i>
<i>you stare at your feet</i>
<i>while you walk.</i>
<i>She said</i>
<i>she liked it quite a bit,</i>
<i>but has not replied.</i>
<i>Obviously, with things</i>
<i>such as mail,</i>
<i>the gesture is more loaded</i>
<i>than the content.</i>
<i>B, the second effect</i>
<i>of this behavioral mask</i>
<i>and assumed ambivalence</i>
<i>is also something</i>
<i>that has not happened.</i>
<i>It is that</i>
<i>you almost never inquire</i>
<i>as to the nature</i>
<i>of her relationships</i>
<i>with other men.</i>
<i>This leaves you to infer</i>
<i> that she is as flirtatios</i>
<i> and intimate with you</i>
<i>as she is with</i>
<i>her other male friends.</i>
<i>So, you may</i>
<i>or may not be special.</i>
<i>Maybe she saw you stumbl.</i>
<i>The third happening is</i>
<i>that one evening</i>
<i>she sent you a message.</i>
<i>It read,</i>
<i>"I think I love you?"</i>
<i>Question mark.</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>"I know</i>
<i>I love you,"</i>
<i>was the response that</i>
<i> immediately jumped</i>
<i> inside my mouth.</i>
<i>But instead, because</i>
<i>you wanted to maintain</i>
<i>your facade of</i>
<i>even-keeled ambivalence,</i>
<i>you did not immediately reply.</i>
<i>You waited.</i>
<i>She called you.</i>
<i>You missed the call.</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>Of course</i>
<i>you telephone her back.</i>
Hey.
<i>She said she had to</i>
<i> get on the subway</i>
<i> and couldn't talk.</i>
(INAUDIBLE)
<i>Nothing more</i>
<i> was said about it.</i>
<i>So, you did your best</i>
<i> to believe</i>
<i>that it was a lighthearted,</i>
<i>humorous transmission.</i>
TERENCE: <i>What is this acting?</i>
<i>What am I doing,</i>
<i>acting-wise?</i>
NAMIK: <i>Your just enjoying</i>
<i>my company.</i>
<i>Oh, so I'm enjoying</i>
<i>your company.</i>
<i>Like when</i>
<i>I tell you bedtime</i>
<i>stories and stuff.</i>
You tell me
bedtime stories?
Pretend like we're in bed.
Oh. Okay. Tell me one.
This feels like we're at home.
This does feel like
we're at home
in Union Square Park.
Really?
It does.
You just got
to tell me something
about you.
No, that doesn't
feel like home.
(GIGGLING)
You got to
tell me a story
about something.
Like the stars?
That's not a star.
It's a plane.
That's a star!
NAMIK: How do you
go about...
Kissing someone?
You don't head-bump, eh?
You make your lips available.
So, you like...
You go 80% of the way,
and let them go 20%.
Right?
(INDISTINCT)
I go 80, you go 20.
NARRATOR 1: <i>Note one,</i>

How Would You Feel?
(BLEEP) <i>had yet to create</i>

TERENCE: <i>A lot of stuff</i>

<i>A whole lot of stuff.</i>

it's your first film.

(NARRATOR 1 READING)
NARRATOR 1: <i>First,</i>
<i> there was the void.</i>
<i>A temporary void that</i>
<i>lasted between</i>
<i>two and three weeks.</i>
<i>The void was preceded</i>
<i>by an explosion.</i>
<i>The story begins</i>
<i>either after the void,</i>
<i>or in the middle of</i>
<i> the explosion.</i>
<i>You cannot remember whic.</i>
<i>You fell in love</i>
<i> with her in 2001.</i>
<i>The last time you saw her</i>
<i>you said goodbye,</i>
<i>and left her in her</i>
<i> in a third-floor dorm ro.</i>
<i>You broke into tears</i>
<i>when you arrived</i>
<i>at the second floor.</i>
<i>By the time you left</i>
<i>the building, your eyes</i>
<i>were swollen shut</i>
<i>and your sinuses</i>
<i> filled with mucus.</i>
<i>While making the 15-hour</i>
<i> trip home, you saw an ext</i>
<i> off the highway</i>
<i>with her first, last,</i>
<i>and middle name on it.</i>
<i>Then, there was the explosion.</i>
<i>After or during</i>
<i> the explosion,</i>
<i> you fell in love with her</i>
<i>during the summer of 200.</i>
<i>You expressed this</i>
<i>by giving her a flower</i>
<i>made of a gum wrapper.</i>
<i>You never chew gum.</i>
<i>Sometime after then</i>
<i> and before now,</i>
<i>she became very close to</i>
<i>you in a romantic way.</i>
<i>The two of you felt</i>
<i>a mutual urge to</i>
<i>build a life together.</i>
<i>During the fallout</i>
<i> of the explosion,</i>
<i>you re-united with her</i>
<i>in 2004.</i>
<i>You had kept a picture</i>
<i>of her as a child</i>
<i>in your wallet</i>
<i>for several years</i>
<i> as a teenager.</i>
<i>When you later fell</i>
<i>in love, you noticed</i>
<i>the picture was gone.</i>
<i>The Universe decided</i>
<i>that you did not need</i>
<i>the picture anymore.</i>
<i>You moved to South Africa</i>
<i> in 2005, fell in love tw.</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>Hey,</i>
<i>don't make fun of me.</i>
NARRATOR 1: <i>Of course,</i>
<i>given the fallout</i>
<i>of the explosion,</i>
<i>she fell out of love.</i>
<i>Maybe not so much</i>
<i>because of the explosion,</i>
<i>but because of,</i>
<i> well, you don't know.</i>
<i>She fell out of love</i>
<i> and in love with her,</i>

(NARRATOR 1 VOCALIZING)
<i>And she was with him.</i>
<i> And she was with him.</i>
<i>And she was with him.</i>
<i>And she was with her.</i>
<i>And she lived</i>
<i> on the other side</i>
<i> of the world.</i>
<i>And she lived</i>
<i> on the other side</i>
<i> of the world.</i>
<i>And you were with this movie.</i>
<i>So, in March of 2006,</i>
<i> you made the movie.</i>
<i>A shorter version</i>
<i>of it that did not</i>
<i>allude to the fact...</i>
NARRATOR 2:
<i>...that it was true.</i>
<i>You showed volumes</i>
<i> one through three,</i>
<i> to be exact.</i>
<i>You did not tell her</i>
<i>that the film was</i>
<i>about you and her</i>
<i>when you all  were making it,</i>
<i>but you thought</i>
<i>she may have</i>
<i>already known.</i>
<i>When you screened</i>
<i>the film for about</i>
<i>100 people,</i>
<i>they did not know that</i>
<i>the film was a retelling</i>
<i>of the story of you and her.</i>
<i>You hoped only</i>
<i> she would notice.</i>
<i>That the film</i>
<i> would talk to her.</i>
NARRATOR 1:
<i>And only her.</i>
<i>The following letter was</i>
<i>written t</i>(BLEEP) <i>by Terenc</i>
<i>in the summer of 2006.</i>
<i>It was written and sent</i>
<i>a few weeks after</i>
<i>the screening of</i>
How Would You Feel?
<i>The day afte</i>(BLEEP)
<i>told Terence</i>
<i>she was ending her exclue</i>
<i> romantic relationship.</i>
TERENCE: <i>June 14th,</i>
<i> 2006, 5:27 p.m.</i>
<i>Remember how you</i>
<i>told me that you met</i>
<i>this new guy</i>
<i>that you are dating</i>
<i> in Union Square?</i>
<i>Well, he must be</i>
<i>very lucky, 'cause</i>
<i>I'm in Union Square</i>
<i>right now, and</i>
<i>I'm here pretty often,</i>
<i>and I never see</i>
<i>anybody like you.</i>
<i>I guess I spoke too soon,</i>
<i>'cause she looks amazing,</i>
<i>but, alas, there are</i>
<i>"too many in the wolf pack"</i>
<i>as they say.</i>
<i>Anyhow, on to the chase.</i>
<i>I am writing this letter</i>
<i>to tell you that I have e</i>
<i> to be in love with you.</i>
<i>And before, you know,</i>
<i> you were in a relationshp</i>
<i> and everything,</i>
<i>me being in love with you was</i>
<i>as much a source of angst</i>
<i>as it was pleasure.</i>
<i>But now I feel...</i>
<i>I feel...</i>
<i>I feel fortunate,</i>
<i>the word is "fortunate"</i>
<i>I feel fortunate</i>
<i>that I love you.</i>
<i>And it's a relief because</i>
<i> I don't have to worry abt</i>
<i>things that</i>
<i>I used to worry about.</i>
<i>Things like sucking</i>
<i> on your lip too long,</i>
<i>or being at your houe</i>
<i> certain times of nig.</i>
<i>I have a new freedom,</i>
<i> I guess.</i>
<i>It's a new</i>
<i>and welcoming freedom.</i>
<i>And freedom even at</i>
<i> its least intense is stil</i>
<i>powerfully sensual</i>
<i> and exciting.</i>
<i>Do you remember that day</i>
<i> we were at the lounge</i>
<i> by your old apartment?</i>
<i>And we were talking</i>
<i>about high school,</i>
<i>and high school intimacy,</i>
<i>and whatnot?</i>
<i>And how there are</i>
<i>these little things</i>
<i>that our age has</i>
<i>rendered no longer excit.</i>
<i> You remember that?</i>
<i>Anyway, I was thinking ty</i>
<i> about the rare occasions</i>
<i>when I was lucky</i>
<i>enough to kiss a girl</i>
<i>in high school,</i>
<i>and how back then you knw</i>
<i>that kissing was as</i>
<i> intimate as it was</i>
<i> gonna get that night.</i>
<i>So kissing was more epic,</i>
<i>it was narrative.</i>
<i>Like at the beginning,</i>
<i>you're all scared,</i>
<i>so you peck around the rs</i>
<i> of each other's lips</i>
<i> and breathe all heavy,</i>
<i>and it's...</i>
<i>It was always</i>
<i>really funny to me that</i>
<i>people have a taste.</i>
<i>It's actually a kind of</i>
<i> scary thought because</i>
<i> if you taste a certain w,</i>
<i>then that means there has o</i>
<i>be some sort of predator</i>
<i>out there craving you.</i>
<i>I digress.</i>
<i>But the tasting is le</i>
<i> the story ending 'cae</i>
<i>their taste lingers</i>
<i>on your tongue. Anyway,</i>
<i>all that to say,</i>
<i>I am going to kiss you</i>
<i>like that.</i>
<i>You know how</i>
<i>at the end of letters</i>
<i>people always write,</i>
<i>"Love," then comma,</i>
<i>then their name?</i>
<i>I don't like that</i>
<i>'cause when you use</i>
<i>the phrase, "Love</i>
<i>"comma Terence,"</i>
<i>who would really know</i>
<i>what kind of love</i>
<i>I'd be talking about?</i>
<i>Anyway, I'm gonna replace</i>
<i>the standard "Love" salutation</i>
<i>with my well-thought-out</i>
<i>definition of love,</i>
<i>just to make</i>
<i>my message more exact.</i>
<i>An art form slightly</i>
<i>removed from</i>
<i>its intended context,</i>
<i>Terence.</i>
NAMIK: <i>Terence, how is it</i>
<i>that you have come to</i>
<i>like so much this girl</i>
<i>that sits atop your bed</i>
<i>at night,</i>
<i>just sipping beer,</i>
<i>fighting the fatigue of</i>
<i>really hot summer nights</i>
<i>as her complaints trail y</i>
<i> into soft sighs?</i>
<i>As an astute observer of life,</i>
<i>I always find it a slighy</i>
<i> odd yet intriguing idea</i>
<i>that a man's heart</i>
<i>can be warmed by my presen.</i>
<i>Self-hate or pure inquisition?</i>
<i>I may never be sure</i>
<i>of the source</i>
<i>of my disbelief.</i>
<i>Actually, I find</i>
<i>I hold my disbelief</i>
<i>so strong that sometimes</i>
<i>I subconsciously reject</i>
<i>the love beams</i>
<i> that are cast at me.</i>
<i>It's like an  invisible shield.</i>
<i>If I can't imagine why,</i>
<i>then just maybe</i>
<i>it doesn't really exist.</i>
<i>And if it doesn't exist then,</i>
<i>well, I don't really</i>
<i>have to do</i>
<i>anything about it.</i>
<i>If friendship were</i>
<i>measured in how much</i>
<i>a person understands</i>
<i>and accepts another,</i>
<i>then would that make you</i>
<i>my best friend?</i>
<i>I know, I know, it's</i>
<i>the word that every guy</i>
<i>hates and runs from.</i>
<i>"Friend." Ooh! What is</i>
<i>the state of a world</i>
<i>that runs from friends?</i>
<i>But</i>
<i>I think I might have</i>
<i> lost you in my world.</i>
<i>Follow the bright lights</i>
down the tunnel,
up to the seventh floor.
Now, there.
Terence.
I know you eagerly await
my response,
so here it is.
Because I love
the electrodes that
dance around your brain
and your relentless friendship
and understanding hands,
I will tell you.
As I come to know and
love myself, so will I you.
I am that I am, and one day,
I may love you, too.
NARRATOR 1: <i>Emotional memory</i>
<i> is your memory</i>
<i>of how you felt as opposed</i>
<i>to what happened.</i>
<i>You have been making</i>
<i>this movie on and off</i>
<i>for three years.</i>
<i>You no longer live</i>
<i>in the same city,</i>
<i>or know the same people.</i>
<i>You value different</i>
<i> things in life now.</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>You know</i>
<i>that she has forgotten</i>
<i>how she felt about you.</i>
<i>The memory of</i>
<i>the touch of your lips</i>
<i>has faded from her mind.</i>
<i>You are to her</i>
<i> a regrettable sin,</i>
<i> seldom enjoyed,</i>
<i>pushed away on</i>
<i>account of the guilt.</i>
<i>Or, more than likely,</i>
<i>your relationship</i>
<i>with her is a memory</i>
<i>so faint in the first plac,</i>
<i>it was not valuable</i>
<i> enough to keep,</i>

<i>You hope it is the latter,</i>

NARRATOR 1:
<i>Turn off the music.</i>
<i>Even though you know</i>
<i> that you should.</i>
<i>Let's recap what</i>
<i> you learned in volume th.</i>
<i>Reality, part one.</i>
<i>First, that you are</i>
<i>emotionally unavailable.</i>
<i>Second, you are lonely,</i>
<i>and making the film with hr</i>
<i>did not repair that.</i>
<i>Third, you cannot write</i>
<i>about the situation</i>
<i>without focusing</i>
<i> on the worst of it.</i>
<i>Fourth, you are</i>
<i>quite an unlucky chap.</i>
<i>The following adds</i>
<i> to this list</i>
<i>and further explores</i>
<i>the nature of reality.</i>
<i>Is it an organism that</i>
<i>grows independent of you?</i>
<i>Is it ever-present?</i>
<i>Is it possible that</i>
<i> something that</i>
<i>transpires in your real</i>
<i>life can have less of an</i>
<i>effect on your emotions</i>
<i>than something you imagine?</i>
<i>What is the code</i>
<i>of reality's inescapable</i>
<i>and adaptable influence</i>
<i>on this momentary feelin?</i>
<i>We left off at number</i>
<i> four, so number five.</i>
<i>In reality, you have</i>
<i>never been punctual</i>
<i>in your life.</i>
<i>You come from a long</i>
<i>line of ancestors</i>
<i>who operate time</i>
<i>based on celestial happenings</i>
<i>still undiscovered</i>
<i>by the Western world.</i>
<i>You are thus out of sync</i>
<i>as opposed to late.</i>
<i>It is both unfair</i>
<i>and culturally insensitive</i>
<i>for you to expect yoursef</i>
<i> to transform into</i>
<i> a model of punctuality</i>
<i>within any</i>
<i>finite period of time.</i>
<i>Number six.</i>
<i>Your ineptitude</i>
<i>with bed fabrication</i>
<i>and construction</i>
<i>had more to do with</i>
<i>your lack of time</i>
<i>than lack of ability.</i>
NARRATOR 2: <i>Like cooking,</i>
<i>with carpentry, patience</i>
<i>is the all-important</i>
<i> coefficient in the equat.</i>
<i>Seventh and very importa,</i>
<i> again dealing with reali,</i>
<i>somehow along the way</i>
<i> you became gravely, deep,</i>
<i>and intensely in love</i>
<i>wit</i>(BLEEP)
<i>Thus, no film</i>
<i>nor explanation, nor poe,</i>
<i>nor kiss,</i>
<i>nor absence, nor presence,</i>
<i>nor reciprocation</i>
<i>could erase how you felt</i>
<i>that moment.</i>
<i>It was a symptom of your love.</i>
<i>It is a symptom of your love.</i>
<i>It will be a symptom</i>
<i> of your love.</i>
<i>Today, the days before,</i>
<i>or the next day.</i>
<i>Speaking of the next day,</i>
<i> when you arrive home</i>
<i> and start to get settled,</i>
<i>you again see that</i>
<i>she has telephoned you.</i>
<i>Of course, you</i>
<i> telephone her back.</i>
<i>You arrange to meet</i>
<i>to talk about the film.</i>
<i>You want to interview he,</i>
<i> get her perspective,</i>
<i> include it.</i>
<i>You arrive at her home</i>
<i>and sit close to her</i>
<i>in a beanbag chair.</i>
<i>You ask her questions,</i>
<i>she answers.</i>
<i>In the answers</i>
<i> she tells you that</i>
<i>she was significantly enamored</i>
<i>with you for a good while</i>
<i>after meeting you.</i>
<i>But as your relationshp</i>
<i>subtly intensified,</i>
<i>she choose the practicality</i>
<i>and constraint of her and him</i>
<i>over the irrationality</i>
<i>and freedom</i>
<i>of her and you.</i>
<i>She also tells you that</i>
<i>she has one day</i>
<i>previous to this day</i>
<i>chosen to dissolve</i>
<i> her exclusive</i>
<i>romantic relationship.</i>
<i>You smile inside.</i>
<i>She continues.</i>
<i>She tells you that</i>
<i>she is dating someone new.</i>
<i>After a few moments,</i>
<i>the possibility of</i>
<i>this information taking</i>
<i>the form of a joke</i>
<i>fades.</i>
<i>Your inner smile fades with it.</i>
<i>Of course, after you talk,</i>
<i>rewrite some of the script,</i>
<i>laugh, hope,</i>
<i>the time comes</i>
<i>for you to sleep,</i>
<i>somewhere.</i>
<i>As you would expect for</i>
<i>a woman who is taken,</i>
<i>she will not be able</i>
<i> to house you that evenin.</i>
<i>You walk to the door.</i>
<i>She lightly kisses you</i>
<i>on your lips,</i>
<i>with a look</i>
<i>of doubt and mischief</i>
<i>opaque in her pupils.</i>
BOTH NARRATORS:
<i>Now, at that moment,</i>
<i>given the aforementioned</i>
<i>circumstances...</i>
NARRATOR 1:
<i>...how would you feel?</i>
NAMIK: <i>Hurt, disappointed,</i>
<i>confused.</i>
<i>All the bad adjectives</i>
<i>that you can attach to</i>
<i>a romantic relationshi.</i>
And how do you
salvage that?
How do you...
I'm dating someone that
might be watching
this right now,
and I don't want to
say anything about it.
I got into a...
(TAPE FAST-FORWARDING)
At the end of the day
you listen to you heart.
Right?
My heart
is
excited
at the thought of him, and also
very tenuous.
Because when you walk into
a situation knowing that
you're about to be hurt
at some point...
It's a weird thing.
Like, why would you
logically do that?
It doesn't make any sense.
But I'm learning that
some things just can't
and don't make sense. Ever.
I do think that I could
get hurt with you.
Because I think you're...
Hmm...
I think you're an artist.
I think...
What?
You have a wandering heart.
You don't get into
a relationship or not
based on
the probability of a good
or bad thing happening.
There is this emotional
impulse that I can't explain
or understand or control.
I hate it for that reason,
but I have to also
follow it because...
How often does that happen?
At times.
Because I was normally
in a position that
I would be a bad person
if I obeyed it.
I get it sometimes,
but I think I've been...
I think I've kind of
conditioned myself.
After so long of being
in a situation
where it wasn't
a viable possibility,
I started to see you
in a different way.
In layman's terms,
I got friend zoned.
(MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
(RINGING)
Hello?
Hey.
Hey.
Where you at?
I'm at home.
Am I supposed to be
somewhere else?
I don't know.
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry, I was
supposed to come
over today, wasn't I?
Or actually,
maybe it was tomorrow?
No, it was today.
Sorry.
I just got home from work.
My mind's just...
Anyway, how was your day?
It was okay.
It was really frustrating.
But what are you
going to do? I'm going
to quit though.
When are you going to quit?
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
I know.
I can't quite tomorrow.
I'm gonna quit,
but I just need
some time to work it out.
So, I'll see you another time?
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
Yeah, I'm sorry,
but we can definitely
reschedule for really soon.
I'll just check my schedule
and let you know how soon
I can get together.
Is that okay?
Okay.
Okay, bye.
(MOUTHING) Bye-bye.
(SIGHS)
