Bless me, Father, for l have sinned.
lt's been a year
since my last confession.
l never told anyone this. Not my
mom, the police, not my friends.
Except for the ones who were there,
and they're not around anymore.
- You see, l ...
- Yes?
l killed a man.
But it was an accident.
A terrible accident, and l've tried
to get past it, but l can't.
- Go on.
- l have these ... dreams.
Really horrible dreams.
This man is always there with me.
He was a killer. He murdered Barry
and Helen, but l got away with it.
l guess l just need to deal with it,
you know?
Face the fear and the guilt.
Finally say his name.
Ben Willis.
- Ben Willis.
- l know.
You know? How could you ..?
l know what you did last summer.
Nice to see you find political
science so stimulating, Miss James.
Sorry.
- Julie, wait. Are you okay?
- l'm fine.
- You sure? You don't seem fine.
- l had another dream, Will.
- The one in the shower?
- ln a church. God, it was so real.
l thought the dreams were over.
- lt'll get better.
- lt can't get worse.
l've freaked out in class before.
l can't study, l can't sleep.
l'm this close to failing school.
Happy Fourth of July!
- lt was one year ago.
- lt's the anniversary.
- You've just got to take it easy.
- l'm really trying.
Sometimes l wonder why l came here.
- To get out of Southport?
- Right. Now l remember.
Are you going away for the Fourth?
l'll be studying for the finals.
The joys of summer school.
Are you okay? Sure?
You're definitely okay?
Yes, l'm definitely okay.
Thanks for the talk, Will.
You're good to me.
- l am?
- Yeah.
- Okay, l'll see you later.
- Okay. Bye.
- Julie.
- Ray? God, what are you doing here?
l got in early. Who was that guy?
That's Will. He's a friend.
You'd like him. We're just friends.
All guys trying to pick up a girl
try the "good friend" thing first.
Ready to go? You know the drill.
The Croaker Queen Pageant.
Small-town fun, but nice.
- Ray, l can't.
- Can't what?
l feel like l haven't healed enough
to go back. So please understand.
- l understand.
- lt's not you.
lt's all me. ln my head.
l want to go back.
l want to be fine, to be with you.
l want it all to be like it was.
lt just isn't. Why don't you stay up
here? Fireworks over the river ...
l have to work, Julie. My boat's in
Southport, remember? But it's cool.
You need your space from Croakerland
and probably from me too.
- Ray ...
- Just forget it.
l'm scared, that's all.
Shit.
What the hell are you doing
in my closet?
l thought you left.
l just wanted to borrow your skirt.
- Jesus, that was heart attack time!
- Can l have the knife now?
- Come out with me tonight.
- l just tried to stab you.
- l hardly feel like dancing.
- What's the matter?
- l think l hurt Ray's feelings.
- Listen to me.
Ray is a great guy.
Nothing against old Ray, -
- but he's so ... Ray.
He lives in Southport.
Will lives right down the street.
- But there's nothing between us.
- Yet. Nothing yet.
l'm working at the club. And you,
Dancing Queen, are coming with me.
- No, l'm not ...
- Yes, you are. What did I say?
You know what l want to do to you,
right?
- No.
- ls there a place we can be alone?
- l don't think so. lt's crowded.
- Come on.
- l just want to talk for a minute.
- lf it only takes a minute, no way.
l'll talk real, real slow.
Not at work. Do me a favour.
Ask Julie to dance.
You know, Jules, you're the most
beautiful woman in the bar tonight.
Ty, you're an unstoppable
force of nature.
You better recognise.
That's how my species survives.
- So, what's up? Wanna dance?
- Say yes. No means yes.
Ty, have you seen my people dance?
We do the mouth thing. Snap fingers.
You can always
just stand there and watch me.
l have an idea.
Why don't we all go dance?
Let's go.
Oh, what do you know?
Will Benson, looking fine.
- Did you tell him l'd be here?
- l told him you wouldn't be here.
- And he came anyway. What's up?
- This wasn't my idea.
- This wasn't ...
- You'll be fine. Do your thing.
- Be good, Julie.
- You want to get a drink?
Hey ... Did you see something
back there?
l'm really sorry, but l've got
to go home right now. l'm sorry.
Morning.
- l love when they do that.
- That could break the machine.
- That's Ty.
- My number's unlisted.
Relax. We've been dating for three
months and he is not a stalker.
This is Mark in the Morning
from Magic 96. 7 radio station.
lt's Mark in the Morning! Put on
the speakerphone. Oh, my God. Hi.
- Hi, Mark. l'm Karla Wilson.
- WeII, what are you doing at home?

I hope you remember your geography.

- Oh, no. Did you say Rio?
- No.

A trip for four to Tower Bay IsIand

- l can't hear.
- We'II caII back with the detaiIs.
- What's your favourite station?
- 96.7!
That's what I thought.
Okay, who am l gonna take? Tyrell,
my parents, cousins ... Okay, Julie.
Mark said four tickets. So you
have to think of someone to bring.
Ray? Phone.
- Hi.
- I'm reaIIy gIad you caIIed.
l'm sorry. l shouldn't have left
so fast. l just ...
It's okay. Ray, Iisten ...
Karla won a trip to the Bahamas,
to this island called Tower Bay.
- She wants us to go with her.
- The Bahamas?
It's a great chance for us to hang
out in the sun, drink, swim ...
... and, well, you know.
- This weekend?
- Yeah.
- You wouldn't go away with me.
- lt's not you. lt's Southport.
- And, God, it's the Bahamas. Free.
- You have to seII his ass on it?
- l really want us to be together.
- We're in the middle of a big run.
lt's been crazy. We go back out
later. l don't think l can make it.
Will you try? For me, please?
Yeah, l'll try, but ... Listen.
If I don't make it up, go ahead.
Have a reaIIy great time.
Ray, for me, try, please.
- l really miss you.
- l miss you, too.
Okay.
Bye.
Dude, we haven't caught dick for
days. She asked you to the Bahamas.
Fuck it, man. You've got to go.
l'll ride up with you.
- Yeah. Stupid ...
- Yeah, stupid.
What were you thinking, man?
l'll show you
what l've been thinking.
Whoa, Ray. Damn. Thanks, but l'll
need some time to think about it.
- Nice fit, huh?
- l'll call and tell her l'm coming.
No, surprise her. She'll be psyched.
Yeah. All right, clean up.
Will you please forget about Ray?
That boy has got fish on the brains.
- Yeah, but ...
- But nothing. Where are we going?
- The Bahamas.
- Where are we going ..?
The Bahamas!
- Try the harmony.
- You try it. l'll lead.
- You, lead? You suck.
- Fuck you. l sound just like him.
- You don't sound anything like him.
- Are you deaf?
l'm quitting this band, man.
l'm going solo.
Oh, shit.
- Let's just go on and find a phone.
- No.
Come on. The guy looks dead, man.
Maybe not.
What are you doing, man?
This is fucked up, man.
Shit.
Shit.
Dave!
No!
Girl, it's getting down to the wire.
He's not coming.
l just thought ...
- You left him four messages. Four.
- He said he'd try.
Try is like maybe, Julie.
Try is bullshit.
- He does work hard.
- My ass ...
He's breaking your heart because he
can. l hate to say l told you so.
Then don't.
Oh, my God.
What's happening, lovers?
Are we gonna get tropical?
Let me talk to you for a minute ...
What's up, Jules?
Julie, l'm really sorry about Will.
But he's my friend, too.
My ticket shouldn't go to waste.
Where there's a Will, there's a way.
Let's start having fun!
ls there a problem?
No, there's no problem,
because we're going to the Bahamas.
- You're goddamn right.
- Right. We're going to the Bahamas!
- l'm in the exit row. Wrong row.
- Are you okay?
Yeah, l'm fine.
Think of happy memories
from your childhood.
And if l don't have any? l can't
relax going 500 miles an hour.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks.
Planes go down for no reason at all.
- Getting hit by lightning is ...
- Yeah, and planes hit other planes.
You're gonna get hit
if you don't quit bitching.
Some folks just can't fly.
- l'm the king of the world!
- l'm the king of the world!
- Just breathe, Tyrell.
- Get away from me.
lt's not a macho thing. lt's about
equilibrium in your inner ear.
You just have to get used to it.
Some folks just can't sail.
And it's the only way on or off the
island, except for the coast guard.
- lt looks pretty remote.
- Tourists want sun, sea, solitude.
- How much longer?
- A few minutes. Hang in there.
Let it out. Just watch the boat.
lf there's anything l can do to make
your stay better, please just ask.
l'm Darick. l'll be at your service
for the duration of your stay.
Old man, l have to work fast.
The season's almost over.
With this weather you're already
out of time. Old man, my ass.
- Beautiful.
- Look at this.
We are here.
We have arrived in paradise!
You've got to be shitting me ...
Look at this cat.
- Yo, what's up, my brother?
- l think we found your brother.
- Your brother.
- You know what l was saying ...
Are you looking for some bud?
l got some bat guano.
l got the cream jeans.
Anything you need, Titus got.
- No, but thank you very much.
- What about the sweet young ladies?
- Anything l can do?
- Take a bath.
Damn, that's cold, woman. All right.
lf you need some weed,
l'll get with you later.
- What's up? Looking for the disco?
- Beat it.
Hello?
- Where is everyone?
- Good question.
Excuse me ... Excuse me.
l'll scare somebody up. Hello?
Yo ..? Shit!
- What can l do for you?
- Checking in. Karla Wilson.
Oh, yes. Well, let's roll out
the red carpet.
Our contest winners are here.
- Last name first. First name last.
- Nice dog you got there, man.
- Not really. He eats guys like you.
- You got a problem with something?
- l don't have problems, pal.
- This is such a beautiful hotel.
Built in the 1 930's
for one of the Rockefeller clan.
There's a lot of history here.
Judy Garland spent the night here.
- President Nixon ...
- Okay. We get it. lt's old.
lt'll outlive you, l'm sure.
Put that down, please.
Sorry.
"Wilson" ... comma. "Karla."
Oh ... You're in 201 and 202.
- ls that a bad thing?
- No, not at all. Not at all.
- Those are our honeymoon suites.
- Your what?
l take it
you kids haven't exchanged vows.
- We haven't exchanged anything.
- Julie, come on. That'll be fine.
Our off-season staff of five
will tend to your every need.
- Did you say off-season?
- lt's the Fourth of July weekend.
Storm season begins today
like clockwork.
lt's our version of winter.
That's 201 and 202. Scrabble
and Parcheesi in the lounge.
Enjoy.
Ain't nothing free in this world.
l wanted you to have a great trip.
We will. Don't worry about that.
We got the island to ourselves.
- And it's been blue skies all day.
- Guys, this is us. 202.
- The bags.
- 201 and 202.
- Don't use these much.
- Why?
No reason. They're fancy rooms
for kids your age.
- We won a competition.
- And what did you have to do?
- Guess the capital of Brazil.
- Rio, baby.
Good for you, girl. And where
would you like l put your bags?
- You can put our stuff back here.
- You promised.
- l also promised Tyrell.
- What's up? You're killing me.
l can sleep on the couch so they can
practice that reaI honeymoon.
l've been doing this since before
you were a gleam in your dad's eye.
- You sure it's cool with you?
- Sure. As long as you don't snore.
lf l get out of hand,
you can toss something at me.
- He looks pretty beat up.
- Yeah. But he seems certain.
His friend was killed by a Ben
Willis, who had a hook on his hand -
- and was driving a BMW.
Look, there's no body.
No other vehicle involved.
He feel asleep at the wheel, crashed
his truck and fell into a ditch.
- He suffered severe head trauma.
- lt'll all come back to him.
Doctor, number three just flatlined.
Get me some help.
l've got a flatline, room three.
Let's get a couple of drinks.
Oh, shit.
- This bar is ...
- Empty?
- You boys lost?
- Wow, a human being.
- Tell me this isn't the bar scene.
- You want a drink?
- We didn't dress up for nothing.
- You're dressed up?
All right, Will, we got a Planter's
Punch, a Singapore Sling ...
How about a Mai-motherfucking-Tai?
Yeah ...
How about some lD ..?
l'm kidding.
- This place isn't quiet, it's dead.
- Well, it's ...
- The last day of the season.
- Why are you still here?
That's none
of your goddamn business.
- l think l smell man trouble.
- Not anymore.
- Did he dump you?
- No. l shot him.
Now, what you boys want
is a Dark and Stormy.
A little rum, ginger beer, Tabasco.
lt's good. Trust me.
Am l bad? He's kind of cute, right?
- And he has a crush on you. But?
- But l miss Ray.
- l really do. l tried to call him.
- Ray made up his own mind.
So you're free. For 48 hours, your
smile is a frown turned upside down.
- Here comes my baby.
- You like the outfit?
No, l love it. Cool bar, right?
They all look the same, once you've
worked in one. Right, sister?
- You look beautiful.
- l'm Julie. This is Karla.
Nancy. Well, welcome to
Tower Bay's most happening hot spot.
Our room is the happening hot spot.
- Four Dark and Stormies.
- All right. To a great weekend.
Screw the weather.
What do you do around here for fun?
Make fun of tourists.
Or let them make fun of themselves.
- Karaoke. Perfect.
- That's what l'm talking about.
- Don't even think about it.
- Don't listen to the party-poopers.
This is for someone who needs it.
- So one single with extra cheese.
- No.
- Yes, Julie.
- No ... No!
- What did l say?
- Come on, Julie. Come on ...
Julie in the house!
Ladies and gentlemen, a round
of applause for my very best friend.
- Julie James!
- Julie in the house. Julie ...
- All right ... Thank you, Karla.
- You're welcome.
Are you happy?
Hi, Will ...
Everyone's a goddamn singer.
l don't know the lyrics. Hold on.
lt's him. He did something
to the screen. l swear to God.
- Julie, what's wrong?
- l swear to God, it said ...
- Julie, what are you talking about?
- Nothing.
Where are you going? Julie?
Shit ...
- Oh, my God. Will, l'm so sorry.
- lt's my fault.
- l shouldn't have. l didn't think.
- This is so sweet. l'm sorry.
- l scared you. l crossed the line.
- You scared me, but l'm on edge.
- Sorry.
- Don't apologise. l'm the one ...
l understand.
l'm just gonna take a walk.
Are you sure?
l just really like you a lot.
l want you to have a great time.
l want you to be happy.
l'll just grab a few things here.
God, l'm sorry.
Sorry.
- Bounce, baby.
- You know what?
l've decided
to change my major to finance.
And l'm going to Wall Street.
You know why?
Because it's the only way l can
afford a big-ass bed like this.
Show me some love
on this big-ass bed.
- Oh, a Jacuzzi.
- Come on, let's stay right here.
l spent $1 00 on a bathing suit. You
can pull it off, but l'm wearing it.
You didn't mention that earlier,
sexy thing.
- You scared the shit out of me!
- You're living your life in fear.
lt's time for manhood. There's
a kick-ass party on the mainland.
l'm saying we take the boat
and get jiggy with it.
l have to tie the boat. There's a
storm coming. Then l'm going to bed.
- And that's it?
- That's all l got for today.
- Take the bake elsewhere.
- All right ... Bullshit.
You need to take a chill pill.
- Have a good time, bro.
- l will, buddy.
Titus!
Oh, damn it.
Very funny, asshole.
Hey, give me a hand, would you?
- Long distance.
- l need an international operator.
Come on!
Housekeeping.
Housekeeping.
- What, what, what?
- Have you seen my hair tie?
l'm sorry, baby. l just
don't want to get my hair wet.
l finally got you in this Jacuzzi.
Let's not talk about hair care.
- Don't get feisty.
- lt's too late for all that.
We're miles away from anybody.
So nobody can hear you scream.
l used to be a lifeguard. And please
don't make me blow my whistle.
l'd just hate
for you to blow ... your whistle.
No water sports after midnight.
Hotel policy.
- What's the policy on burning herb?
- You can't try it till you buy it.
What's up? lt's all good.
Believe me, it is all good.
Crazy freak.
Now, where was l?
- Hey, guys. lsn't this beautiful?
- Damn.
1 0 people on this island,
and they all end up in this Jacuzzi.
- How's the water?
- Crowded.
- How's Julie doing?
- She's up in her room alone.
- Any advise?
- Find another Jacuzzi.
You can't give up so easy.
You've got to hang in there.
lt's great, isn't it?
l can't win. l can't ...
Will?
Where the hell's my toothbrush?
- Hey, l know, l know ...
- Will!
Will! lt's happening again.
What happened?
l do not find this at all funny.
There was a body. l swear it.
- Maybe you were dreaming.
- l wasn't.
l knew you were gonna be trouble
the moment l laid eyes on you.
- Listen to me. He's here.
- What's going on?
Julie says she saw a dead guy in
the closet. All we see is bathrobes.
You think this is funny? l'm not
going crazy. He was in there.
Oh, yeah? Then where is he now?
Where's the dead guy?
- What did you actually see?
- The dockhand hanging by his neck.
Look, tomorrow we'll talk to Darick
and put this whole thing to rest.
So let's slow down on the Dark
and Stormies and get some sleep.
- l want off this island.
- That's not possible.
The last ferry left hours ago,
and we have a storm coming.
- l'll call the mainland for a boat.
- The phones just went down.
lt's dead.
Listen up. The next couple of days
will be rough, but we'll make it.
- What about a radio?
- Emergencies only.
You city kids wouldn't know
a hurricane if it blew up your ass.
This is not a drill. All we can do
is batten down and ride it out.
And if it gets really bad,
we have a storm shelter. Goodnight.
Pain of the past, fear
of the future, blood of the young.
Pain of the past, fear
of the future, blood of the young.
Pain of the past,
fear of the future ...
... blood of the young.
Yeah, that's my babies.
You all growed up real good.
Where are you hiding?
Come to Papa, come to Papa ...
Yeah, that's it.
Got to find that damn lighter ...
Can l help you?
Goddamn it!
Oh, God ...
What are you doing? No.
Seriously, don't do that.
Oh, God ... Jesus, no!
lt's all good!
Can l help you?
- That's a full carat.
- How much?
- She's got some flaws in her.
- How much?
l don't have much of a market
for this kind of thing.
- 200. Maybe 250.
- Make it 300.
And throw in that, too.
Which one you talking about? You're
crazy. That's worth 300 by itself.
- Then there's the waiting period.
- Keep the ring and give me the gun.
- You sure you want to go this way?
- ls it loaded?
- No.
- Load it.
Get the hell off of me.
Baby, this is bullshit. This ain't
the romantic weekend l had in mind.
Hey, Jules, get any sleep?
- Some.
- Look at that.
Another beautiful day in paradise
with Julie as our tour director.
- Do you see any fresh kill?
- Shut up, Ty.
- How about a Freddie or Jason?
- Leave her alone, man.
lt's bad enough getting rained out
without having to hold her hand.
- Don't be an asshole about it.
- lt's okay. He doesn't believe me.
- lt's his right. Maybe l am crazy.
- Nobody thinks you're crazy.
- l do.
- Why don't you go do something?
l don't want to do nothing with him.
l want to do something with you.
Let's go to the gym and work off
some stress. You're not crazy.
Look, we need to find stoner boy
and get pool sticks or something ...
The greenhouse effect
has caused the Gulf Stream to shift.
Experts expect a dramatic increase
of hurricanes, coastal flooding ...
lt wouldn't take much
to wipe us off this island.
Shut up, okay? Shut up.
God!
Come on!
This is a nice gym.
Nice move.
l'm gonna give your fisherman some
of this and see how he likes it.
Oh, poor baby.
You know what? l got a better idea.
You're not leaving this island
till you get a tan.
- Wow. Cancer in a box.
- No, this is the safe sun.
lt's better than
a day on the beach, girl.
With a little photosynthesis
you'll feel like a new ...
- House plant?
- Exactly. Bye.
- Sure this is the way to the pool?
- There's his cart.
The fucking idiot
left it in the rain.
Dryer. "Gee, Karla,
that'll break the machine."
Damn. How many pairs are in there?
Hey, pool boy!
Yo, Bob Marley!
You in there or what?
Karla?
Karla?
Come on!
Tyrell!
You guys, help me!
Use this. Just smash it.
Come on.
l told you l'm not crazy. He's here.
We've got to call for help.
Man, this classifies
as a fucking emergency!
Hey, Brooks. Where the fuck you at?
We want off this fucking island.
- Oh, shit.
- We've got to get the fuck out.
Julie!
- Where are the boats?
- They were cut loose.
- Julie, what the fuck is going on?
- He's gonna kill us one by one.
- Who?
- Ben Willis.
- Willis is dead. You killed him.
- They never found the body.
We lied. We hit him with our car
and threw his body in the water.
Only he didn't die. Last Fourth
of July he killed Barry and Helen.
l thought Ray and l killed him,
but we didn't.
- He's back to finish it off!
- We're in the middle of nowhere.
There's dead bodies piling up
and there's only one guy missing.
- The porter. What's his name?
- Estes. The fucker knows something.
We can sit here like assholes
or go find him first.
- lt's not him.
- We have to do something.
l'm with him.
Come on.
How can you not tell me the whole
story? l'm your best friend!
- l didn't want to involve anybody.
- Well, it's too late for that now.
Come on, let's go!
Hey, Estes. You sick bastard,
are you in here?
Hey, Estes. You sick bastard,
are you in here?
You hear me? Sick mother ...
- He's not here, man.
- There's some crazy shit in here.
No doubt.
This is our fucking killer.
This is our fucking guy.
You guys.
Shit.
Fuck.
- Anyone missing a hair tie?
- Shit. That's mine.
What about a toothbrush?
Voodoo.
We need flashlights, guns, whatever
we need to get off this island.
- What if he's down there?
- Let's just get the fuck out.
- You wait here.
- lt's safer up here.
l'll just be a second.
Julie, where are you going?
What the hell was that?
Shit. Julie?
- Brazilia.
- Julie, watch out!
That's the capital of Brazil.
Not Rio.
No, guys! Leave him alone!
- This is the killer.
- We've seen the voodoo stuff.
l found the bodies this morning.
l tried the radio, it was destroyed.
- Leave him alone. l believe him.
- l haven't hurt anyone.
l stole those things to protect you.
He could have killed me, but didn't.
We didn't answer the question right.
This whole thing was a set-up.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil.
Sorry. We lose.
- So where's this Ben Willis guy?
- l don't know.
You never know. How do we know
you didn't set this whole thing up?
- How do we know you didn't?
- l know who you're talking about.
He used to work here. l've seen

He worked here for many years.
Raised a family. Pretty wife.
Two little ones. A boy and a girl.
One day the wife went missing.
The maid found blood
all over the honeymoon suite. 201 .
Eventually they found the body.
Pieces of it, at least.
People say she was cheating on him.
People say he would beat her.
People say a lot of things.
He disappeared. Children, too.
- Now he's back.
- Julie, be careful.

- Where did Estes go?
- Why? He can't help us anyway.
- Only he can. l'll find him.
- Are you gonna leave us here?
- lt's okay. He can't have gone far.
- Meet us back at the hotel, okay?
Okay? Come on, let's go.

Butter him?
Clean vegetables? Take this.

Shit ... Hey, are you okay?
We're gonna get this fucker, right?

Estes, where did you go?
You said you were gonna help us.
You should have told us

Stop trying to act
like you ain't hungry.

So that's where
the flashlights were.
- Sorry, but it could have been you.
- Or you, you crazy bitch.
- You broke into my hiding place.

- Here we go.
Don't get her started. lt's a long,
fucked-up story you won't believe.
This is the worst vacation in my

No, you're not.
- Are you okay?

Everything is gonna be okay.
Just get inside. Estes attacked me.

Jesus, you're bleeding to death.
We need a first-aid kit.

- All right, just sit there.
- Don't worry. He's gone. Just go.
- Look, l'll go with you. Come on.
Listen, Will. You're gonna be okay.
Jesus, there's blood everywhere.

Estes ...

Get up ...
God, no!
We finally get to spend
some quality time together.
- Why are you doing this to me?
- lt's always about you.
"l have bad dreams. l can't sleep.
l have trouble with my boyfriend."
You never take responsibility for
anything you do. Not even murder.
What did you do that for?
You're a bitch.
- That's gonna leave a mark.
- Tell me why.
Come on, think. You'll get it.

No more running. lt's time to die.
Let her go ... Let her go.
You've got to be shitting me!
- What will you do? Call us names?
- Let her go now!
Think about it, boy.
You're no killer. That's my job.
You don't have it in you.
Sure did miss you down here, Ray.
Too bad. We could have been friends.
Really, man.
l would have shared her with you.
Come on, Ray. Stay with me.
You see that?
l want you to think about all
the things we're gonna do to her.

- You know me too well.
Don't you dare go to sleep, girl.
