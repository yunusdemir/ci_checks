Where does Master Fang live?
There's no such person here.
We've been asking around, my friend.
Please step forward if you will.
Guess you must be Master Fang.
Well, that is my surname.
But I'm only a farmer.
Honourable person doesn't reveal
his true self.
We both brothers are here to
deliver an invitation.
Please accept it, Master Fang.
We have never met before;
Perhaps you have the wrong person.
Master Fang, are you pretending...
...that you really don't know us?
Judging by your expression...
I imagine you two must be quite famous
It's a pity I'm only a farmer,
unaware of anything.
I truly don't recognise.
I'm Guan Shun,
and this is my elder brother Guan Heng.
We're also known as
the "Black and White Swordsmen"
Here's the invitation.
Please pack up and come with us.
Or we'll pay you a visit again
at midnight.
Fifth of May, Dragon Boat Festival.
Duelling Contest at our stronghold.
We request your presence to elect
a "King of Swords"
To: Master Fang Gang, One-Armed Swordsman
From: The Furtive King, Ling Xu.
Hercules, Jiao Feng.
Poisonous Dragon, Duan Shuo.
Spinning Wheels, Song Wen.
Flying fighter, Deng Fei.
Hell's Buddha, Shi Fu.
Ape's arms, Yuan Qian.
Thousand Hands Lady, Hua Niangzi.
Time for lunch, dear.
Come home to eat.
What's this?
To: Master Fang Kang, One-Armed Swordsman
Aren't you eating?
Would you be going?
Of course not. Rest assured and eat.
You really won't be going?
How come you're so worried about it?
I did promise I won't get involved
in these matters.
I'm not eager to see them
struggling for 'Kingship'.
They can go ahead and crown
whoever wants to be.
Are you sure you don't care?
I only care about you.
Is Master Fang at home?
Are you Master Fang?
That sure is my surname.
How may I help you?
I'm Lu Long,
the Chief of Chaoyang Sword Clan.
These are my sons...Lu Tong, Lu Da.
Greet Master Fang.
Yes, father.
Master Fang.
Please.
And this must be Mrs. Fang.
You're welcome.
Please make yourself comfortable
in my humble dwelling
Sorry to bother you.
What can I do for you, Master Lu?
Hero Fang, so you've received this too?
A while back two men delivered it.
One in white and one in black, is it?
They are the Black and White
sword-emissaries
Well-known as the fickle
Black and White Duo.
Hero Fang, do you plan on attending?
No. You see presently I'm just
a farming peasant.
I'd rather not get involved.
I'm just afraid that might not be
up to you.
Sir, I didn't quite get your meaning.
Don't get me wrong.
I mean the stronghold's bandits.
If I don't go,
they could be very persistent indeed!
Exactly. It's been 2 years that
those eight demons...
from the stockaded region have showed up.
Master Fang,
you've been living in seclusion,
that's why you haven't heard of them.
They are all very skilled,
and quite young.
God knows what on earth
brought them together!
I guess it's their ruthless personalities.
By the mere mention of their names,
people turn pale.
Even their sidekicks,
Black & White Swordsmen and
...the Patrol Guards are tough to tackle.
They all have their different styles.
But what they have in common
is their use of swords.
That's why they came up with this idea.
To have a duel.
The goal thereby being...
to make all the sword-using clans...
...recognise them as the leaders.
Master Fang, you're from the
Golden-Sword Clan.
You got rid of Long-Armed Devil
and his student.
Everyone knows. How can they let you
get away?
And what if one refuses?
It's likely they will use force.
Threatening and forcing people
to attend the duel,
this Black & White duo have killed many.
If we just flee like this,
do you think...
Brother, stop babbling.
We can't beat them, we can hide from them.
It's not worthwhile kissing their
smelly feet
Are you Xu Long and Ding Sheng
of the Wanshen Clan?
That would be us.
What can we do for you?
We couldn't help overhearing.
Are you planning to flee?
Our clan is only a weak clan...
...and most of our skilled masters
are dead.
We have no intention to fight.
And we dare not even think about a title.
There's no point for us to go.
What was that about 'smelly feet'
just now?
That...
With my skills,
I am no match for those eight.
But under the circumstances, I have to go.
After some careful thoughts,
I could only think of inviting you.
I haven't practised for long.
Can't help even if I go.
Besides, I've promised my wife that...
I wouldn't be involved.
I regret having to disappoint you.
Master Fang, these eight are arrogant
and fierce.
They are really quite something.
Had they been only interested in a title,
so that they'd be showered with praises...
...as Sword-Kings or whatever,
it'd be fine.
But I think there's more;
They want every one who uses swords to
...be under their rule.
They will kill recklessly to get
what they want.
If you refuse to step in,
...the consequences could be drastic.
It seems you've overestimated me.
And also, all this is your own assumption.
No doubt those eight might be reckless.
But they'd certainly not start a massacre.
Anyhow, I've made up my mind.
I had better keep out of this.
If Master Fang refuses,
I dare not insist.
I only hope that this duel...
won't cause as big a bloodshed
as I expect.
Just in case my worst fears come true...
then I wish that Master Fang would...
do well to remember the lives that
have been lost!
Goodbye.
I bid you farewell
That's alright.
Now perhaps...you'd believe me?
It's not that I don't believe you.
But I've seen you practising everyday.
You haven't forgotten about it.
You must've heard them mention
the Black & White duo.
It's likely they both will visit us
tonight.
Had I not been practising,
how could we handle them?
They'll come tonight?
About 1 2 o'clock, they said.
Master Lu.
Brother Ding, is it?
Brother Ding.
Master Lu, l...
Brother Xu and I refused to
attend the duel.
The Black & White fellas came by
and Brother Xu...
Brother Ding!
You both head back now.
Father!
You saw with your own eyes.
Such being the circumstances I have to go.
Agreed, I'm no match for those eight.
But...
you will sacrifice for nothing
if you came along, too.
But...Dad!
I just hope that I will be safe.
Should anything happen to me,
you can plan to avenge me.
You'd understand if you give it a thought.
You're right, dad. But as your children...
I can understand your feelings.
You must see the big picture
even you want to be filial.
As men, you should know
what's more important.
If I'm still not back after the contest,
then I'm sure other clans will have
the same problem.
The two of you won't be able to do much,
you must contact the members
of other clans...
...and work on a revenge strategy.
And no matter what,
you must try to get Fang Gang's help.
Hang on.
The door is open, watch out...
Your reputation dubs you
as being invincible.
Why don't you both just come on in?
Please accept our invitation.
What if I decline?
We've been ordered by the Eight Chiefs.
We must escort you there.
Then give it a try.
Not being a swordsman now I don't wish
to hurt anyone.
Otherwise I'd have chopped off your arms.
...even before you could draw.
Get the hell out of here!
Not enough?
Xiaoman.
You're still here! Want to die?
We aren't capable enough to
invite Master Fang,
the 8 Chiefs will pay you
a visit some day. Let's go.
"Eight Sword Kings"
Hold it, young man.
We're willing to treat you eight
as the Eight Kings...
...of swords.
You sir, are the Furtive King.
These both...Hercules, and Ape's Arms.
I thought that it was just a contest.
There's no need for such cruelty.
Fine then.
If you don't want to continue,
please leave.
Please.
We take your leave then.
"Hercules, Ape's arms"
Greetings, Spinning Wheels King.
The Second and Seventh Chiefs
had their chance.
Now it's my turn, and my four guards.
Come on.
Very well, the hard way it is!
"Spinning Wheels"
Flying fighter!
Yeah, and my Nine Flying Pupils.
We'll show you some colours.
"Flying fighter"
Hell's Buddha.
And the Seven Earth Bullies, watch out!
"Hell's Buddha, Poisonous Dragon"
Please leave, miss.
This is no place for you.
You are very kind.
Move away...
You are...
Hua Niangzi, also known as
the Thousand Hands King.
You're the Eighth Demon!
That's right.
You seem to be quite nice.
Why are you so serious?
That hurts.
You look very young,
and not as annoying as that man.
What if I help you to flee?
What's your name?
Lu Hong.
Oh, young Master Lu of
the Five Tigers Clan.
No wonder you are so handsome.
Well, let's call it quits.
Let me lead your way.
Thank you, miss.
Why are you staying in a place like this?
Then take me with you.
If you would forsake your past, that's...
Why? Why did you do it?
No reason, just for fun.
Look! I've got so many knives.
That's why I'm called
the Lady of Thousand Hands.
You witch!
"Thousand Hands King"
So, trying to run?
I've been expecting you.
Alright, since we've run into you here...
Please draw and begin.
Draw my sword?
You all claim to be the Sword Kings.
We've fought the others,
and now it's your turn.
Only dead men could see my sword;
And hence my name.
Let's begin.
"Furtive King"
Furtive, Hercules, Poisonous Dragon,
Spinning Wheels,
Flying fighter, Hell's Buddha,
Ape's Arms, 1 000 Hands.
Order from all of us:
Lu Tong and Lu Da of Chaoyang Sword Clan,
Cut off your right arm and
come here to claim your...
...father Lu Long within 1 5 days.
Or your father will be killed,
...and you two will follow suit.
Please.
Brother, this is Shan Xiong of
Duanhun Sword Clan.
This is Lu Chun of Five Tigers Clan.
And these both are Mu Qing,
Mu Jun of Taiji Clan.
Brother Lu.
Please be seated.
Yan Yun of Bagua Clan, Master Lu Chong.
Brother Yan, Brother Lu.
I'm Lu Tong...my younger brother Lu Da.
Brother Lu Tong, Brother Lu Da.
Please take a seat.
Please.
Fellow brothers.
We've all received the letters
from those eight.
I was planning to cut off
my own right arm,
...but my brother stopped me.
He said that the reason our father...
didn't let us go with him to the duel,
was...
so that we could take revenge for him.
He suggested that we should all
meet first...
...before the deadline.
...and discuss about it.
I understand that
those eight demons are...
mean, sinister and one simply can't
take their word.
We don't even know if or not
our seniors are alive.
If we could really save them,
we wouldn't hesitate to cut off
our arms or even die.
But if we do that,
...we'd be walking right into their trap.
It'd mean they have controlled us all.
He is indeed right.
Even if we cut off our right arms,
it doesn't necessarily guarantee
saving our elders.
Even so, they do have our seniors
as hostages;
Maybe we have no choice.
Launching an attack at their own base...
...with our skills is out of question.
Admitted that losing an arm
guarantees nothing...
but that's the least we can do.
Not to forget, it's our filial duty.
We'll go and face those bandits.
Let's all go and kill the
stronghold overlords!
At least we'll be said to
have died spectacularly.
And much better than cutting
our right arms off.
We shouldn't be so passive.
I agree with Brother Shan.
Even if we are prepared to die,
we still have to think about
our elders' safety.
Calm down. Please everyone, settle down
Since the Lu Brothers
have invited us here,
I'm sure they have a plan.
Let's give them a chance to speak.
Our father mentioned that
if something happens,
...there was someone whose help
we'd have to solicit
He's our only hope,
...to win over the eight demons.
Who is he?
Who?
Master Fang Gang,
the noted One-Armed Swordsman.
Dear
Did I wake you?
No. I awoke myself.
There is some congee in the pot.
Have it before you leave for the farm.
Alright.
Aren't you eating?
Later.
You go ahead, I've got something to do.
How far are we from Master Fang's home?
Almost there.
I hear Mrs. Fang doesn't know
any martial arts.
And also Master Fang has promised
her not to...
get involved in the martial world affairs.
If we talk to him at his home,
Mrs. Fang will surely oppose.
Maybe we should wait here.
And you try to invite Master Fang out.
I think it will be easier
when he's on his own.
Good idea.
Please wait for me in the teahouse.
Sure.
Please come in, gentlemen.
Sure.
Please be seated.
Honey, l...
What is it?
I...
Yes?
I'll tell you tonight.
Master Fang.
Knight Lu's younger son, is it?
What happened?
Get up, get up.
My dad is being held hostage.
God knows if he's alive!
Those thieves have also sent a letter...
...warning all of us.
Please take a look.
Cut off your right arm...
and come here to claim your father,
Lu Long.
They've crossed the limit!
Leaders of almost all of the sword clans
...are being captured.
All the clans have received
a similar letter.
We really don't know what to do.
Before leaving, my father mentioned:
Should anything happen,
...we must solicit your help.
We've met up and discussed about it,
...but we are too inexperienced.
Hence we couldn't think of a good plan.
A few of us were dispatched with
a mission to see you.
But not wishing to disturb you here...
they are all waiting in the teahouse.
Shall appreciate if you could please
meet them there.
Our seniors are being captured,
we don't even know whether
they're alive or dead!
Very well, I'll come with you.
This is Master Fang.
Master Fang.
Master Fang, this is Yan Yun
of Bagua Clan.
Lu Chun of Five Tigers Clan,
Mu Qing of Taiji Clan.
Where's Brother Shan?
We thought he followed you.
Didn't you see him?
Please have a seat, Master Fang.
Master Fang, they all have
the same fate as me.
Our elders have been taken hostage...
And we've all received the same letter.
There were around 40 people
from all clans...
who went to the duelling contest.
Not even one has returned.
Now as for the better skilled members
...from the clans,
they've all been ordered to
cut off their arms.
Say, if we follow their instruction,
there won't be any clans left.
Those Eight will be in charge.
We just fear that they won't keep
their word.
That we would cut our arms off
for nothing,
...and that they won't let
our elders out.
Who knows...they mightn't be alive,
God forbid!
They just want us to fall into a trap.
No one actually knows
what the real situation is.
But if our seniors would be killed
just because...
I refuse to cut off my arm,
I would regret forever.
We are inexperienced.
We can't try to find out more
by going there,
nor can we attempt to save the hostages.
Fortunately Master Lu has instructed...
...us before he left.
He told us to insist for your help.
This concerns not only the fall
or rise of our clans.
Over a hundred lives are at stake,
this is serious.
But I've promised my wife. It'd be unfair
I must talk to her first.
Thank you, Master Fang.
It'd be better if you all came along too.
Yes.
Sorry about taking your wife away.
After you've torn down their stronghold,
I'll return her safely- Shan Xiong,
Duanhun Clan.
How dare you lie to me?
No, Master Fang.
You asked me to meet you in the teahouse,
so that your partner could kidnap
my wife as a threat.
You must be dreaming!
No, Master Fang.
We youngsters wouldn't dare do that!
Read it yourself.
Sorry about taking your wife away.
After you've torn down their
stronghold, I'll...
I can't believe Shan Xiong!
How could he do such a thing?
Master Fang, this was done...
...by our ignorant partner.
We honestly have no idea.
When Brother Lu went to visit you,
Shan Xiong said he'll follow.
Then he must have left on his own.
Later, you turned up
and we couldn't care less.
Never thought it'd come to this!
Trust us, we weren't in it together.
Please understand.
We'll set out right away for tracing
him down and then
...we'll escort Mrs. Fang home safely.
Where could he have gone?
My brother has asked us to meet
at the Wild Hog Forest.
He must have gone there.
Fine, let's go.
Come on out.
There's someone in the fields,
go and search
Brother Shan, Master Fang has spotted you.
Get out here.
Fang, you refused to attend
the invitation.
The Eight Chiefs have ordered
to punish you.
By you two?
The Third Chief will be here soon.
You better surrender.
That must be Poisonous Dragon.
He mentioned the Third Chief...
Right, Master Fang.
Anyway, there's no one in the house.
Let's forget it
I must try to catch up with my wife.
I fear that they might have run
into the bad guys.
Brother Shan, you shouldn't have
done that.
All we had to do was request for
Master Fang's help.
Good for you perhaps.
Well, I don't like to beg.
And maybe it wouldn't have got us
anywhere.
This is the most clear-cut way
I could hit on.
Now he'll go to the thieves'
stronghold for sure.
But this is more like threatening him...
Threat? It's better than pleading.
Even if Fang Gang shows up here,
I only need to put my knife on her neck.
He will listen to me no matter what.
The thieves must be watching us,
...if they've found us here.
Even better.
If his wife comes along to their base
with me,
Fang Gang will have to go there.
Brother Shan, with such intentions,
you don't act like you're from
a decent clan.
So? Are you turning your back on me?
Must be the enemies.
Let's inform Master Lu.
Will you release Mrs. Fang or not?
No way.
Brother Lu.
Brother Lu, a 30 people party are
heading our way.
I think they must be the enemies.
Well?
What do you say now?
Go out now if you have guts,
give it all you've got.
If the bandits come charging in...
and kill Fang Gang's wife,
at least we'll have someone to revenge
for us.
Listen, brother Shan
Thank you, Brother Lu.
Mrs. Fang, sorry about all this.
But it wouldn't be fair to involve you.
Brother Lei,
Remain on vigil alert.
Take control here.
I'll escort Mrs. Fang down the back
of the hill.
Okay.
Mrs. Fang, I'll escort you home
right away.
Don't worry, I won't let you...
fall in the hands of the bandits.
Let's go.
You stay here, we'll go after them.
Come on.
Second Brother!
The stronghold bandits have already
been here!
Master Fang, it was he who kidnapped
your wife.
Brother Lei, come here to greet
Master Fang.
Master Fang.
Brother Lu has just escorted
Mrs. Fang at the back.
Brother!
Dear!
Xiaoman, are you alright?
I'm fine, thanks to him.
Everyone's here?
Yes.
Oh brother!
Let's go, Xiaoman.
Dear.
Master Fang.
I intended to help you all.
But you folk kidnapped my wife.
I won't tolerate threats. Let's go.
Brother Mu, you...
As it is, my brother is dead.
Regardless of what you all plan to do.
I've cut off my arm,
and I'll go to claim my father.
Dear, Brother Lu was protecting me
all the while.
He stood up like a shield...
and got slashed, yet he wouldn't budge.
You...
He protected you because...
he needed you to threaten me.
That's not the case.
He was escorting me home.
I was kidnapped by Shan Xiong.
Brother Lu argued with him.
They almost got in a fight.
That's the truth, Master Fang.
Brother Shan was the only one responsible.
He being dead now, Master Fang...
Dear,
It's true, I didn't want you
to get involved.
But this time, after I've seen such
terrible things.
Just this once, you...
Please promise to help them.
We're telling the truth, Master Fang.
Please help us.
Master Fang.
Brother Mu, try to heal.
After you get better, I'll teach you
One-Armed style.
Master!
Get up, and don't call me that now.
So you'll help us?
Master Fang, we youngsters are
deeply grateful.
Master Fang...
Stop it, I'm not much older than you all.
Let's go back to the hut
and discuss first.
On the way don't address me
as 'Master Fang'.
I don't want our enemies to know.
Yes.
Help!
Guys, don't let her get away.
Help!
After her.
Please help!
Hurry back! And tell the 5th Chief
to await my signal.
Thank you for saving me, heroes.
My name is Lihua.
My father was kidnapped by
the Eight thieves.
I've been ordered for a jewelry ransom...
and unluckily I ran into robbers.
Though I don't know where all you
heroes are going...
I shall appreciate if you could
just let me tag along.
Oh, we're heading the same way, so...
You see, we must check with
our leader first.
Honey, please let her come along with us.
Alright.
Someone there is injured,
so he'd have trouble eating.
I'll go serve him.
That is so kind of you.
Where's the chief and his wife?
Something came up.
They'll be eating elsewhere.
Hey, this Miss Lihua is nice,
I don't think that she is...
Although even I don't suspect her, but...
the chief has said many times.
...that we ought to be careful.
Watching all this I feel so scared
of the killings!
Why don't you let me go home?
They are looking for me everywhere.
Although they couldn't find anyone
at home, & may not
...go there again, but it's better
if you stay with me.
Call the waiter, would you.
Waiter.
Here.
Would you like something else?
Nothing. You may retire.
Sure.
You should get some rest,
after the day's journey.
Aren't you sleeping?
I have a feeling that...
something will happen tonight.
Sorry?
Right now, I'm not sure
what they're up to.
So I'll let them make the first move,
...and take care of things as it goes.
Go sleep in the room across the hall.
I'll wake you should anything happen.
Dear, l...
Is there something you want to tell me?
No...nothing.
Lady, we've only met by chance.
There's no need to serve me.
I feel a bit awkward.
It's alright.
That leader of yours, what does he do?
Well, he's our chief.
The leader would of course be the chief.
You didn't answer my question though.
Where are you all going?
Not too sure...it's up to the chief.
Being a little too cautious, are we!
Even if you won't tell me,
...I could have guessed.
What are you doing?
Nothing, just sending a signal
to my fifth brother.
You...
Keep it down, there's just the
two of us here. It'd be...
...so embarrassing if you keep
making odd noises.
Keep quiet and be a good boy, okay!
Miss Lihua, you're still up?
You haven't slept, too!
I am...
You're on night guard, aren't you?
One has got to be careful on the road.
I think you are all on a mission.
Come here.
You've saved me today,
I still haven't thanked you.
Oh, there's no need to.
How old are you?
Nineteen.
I'm twenty one.
So you're younger.
Miss Lihua.
Does my hand feel cold?
You have such a fine physique.
Don't you make a sound!
I still haven't poisoned the well yet.
What is it?
That man from your group wants to rape me.
Come inside.
Who wants to rape you?
He's very young, I don't know his name.
Hmm...why's there blood on you?
You see, he had a sword.
I was struggling.
And somehow...he got stabbed.
He has only himself to blame then.
I see that you are a reasonable man.
With just the two of us here,
& you being...
so close to me, aren't you afraid
I'll take advantage?
It isn't the same thing,
he was just a kid.
But for a manly guy like you,
I'm more than willing.
That's how you killed him back there,
right?
Hua Niangzi.
I could see right through your tricks.
You...knew?
Yes, I knew who you are.
I've been waiting for you to make a move.
You are...
One-Armed Swordsman...Fang Gang!
Master Fang, this witch has poisoned
the well.
Brother Lu, you may get your revenge.
What's going on, Master Fang?
She is Hua Niangzi,
the Thousand Hands Lady
I guess our enemies should be here
anytime.
Let's get prepared.
Yes.
Inform the inn keeper...
...that the water in the well
has been poisoned.
And listen, no matter what happens
out here...
tell the guests not to come out
or light up.
Yes.
Quick, go back and report.
It's Poisonous Dragon.
Huddle up.
We've got to act fast.
Yes.
We can't let down our guard.
He won't be alone.
Up!
Please come inside.
Please.
Please...
Tomorrow we'll go to their base.
You'd wait for me here.
It's so close to their base.
You think that it's safe to leave me here?
They wouldn't think of it
since it's so close.
And also they'll have enough on
their hands tomorrow.
You be careful.
I know.
Although we've been lucky on the way here,
...but I'll be alert nevertheless.
Good.
Right, you've been trying to
tell me something,
...go on.
I...
Come in.
What is it?
Don't be scared,
this belongs to Mu Qing.
I've been saving it for tomorrow.
What are you doing here?
Oh, you chopped off your own arm
to make a claim?
Follow me.
Second Chief.
He's from Taiji Clan.
He has chopped off his arm.
Those pupils who claim they are from...
notable clans are all bloody useless.
No one dares to come forward.
At least he's got some guts.
Search him.
Yes.
Not armed.
The Fourth Chief is on duty today.
Take him inside.
Yes.
Wait here.
Mu Qing of Taiji Clan is here
to make a claim.
Please give us your order, Fourth Chief.
At least there's one.
Our Chief has gone downhill
with the Patrol Guards
...to look for the Third Chief.
Put him in the cell.
And we'll wait until the Chief's back.
Yes.
Hold on.
Bring him inside.
Yes.
Come in.
This is our Fourth Chief, Spinning Wheels.
This young man seems quite skilled;
Yet why would he cut off his own arm?
Hmm...very stubborn, eh!
Have you searched him?
Yes, he's unarmed.
So you are a tough man?
What if I cut off your left arm, too?
Do you think you'll be a tough man then?
I'll wait for...
my Chief and we'll entertain you then.
Put him in the cell.
Yes.
Get in.
Master Fang...!
Hurry! Go!
We'll retreat for now.
Let's go.
Brother Yan...!
Don't worry about me,
wait outside for Master Fang.
Go.
Yan-Erh!
As expected it's you causing
all the trouble!
Attack!
Come on!
Dad...
Dad.
Where's your elder brother?
Yan-erh!
Oh, my son...
Master Fang, we're all waiting for you.
Go on, they mean well.
Please have a seat, Master Fang.
Please.
Please sit down, everyone.
Master Fang.
I don't deserve this.
Most villages in our proximity...
have been bullied by the Eight bandits.
We've taken all kinds of oppressions
from them.
Luckily with the help of Master Fang
and fellow heroes,
...they have been finally rid of.
We have nothing to give you in return,
except a drink to show our appreciation.
Thank you. Cheers.
Cheers.
For us old timers...
we are lucky enough to keep our lives.
And so are many of our students
& children.
We all owe it to you, Master Fang.
Not at all.
As for the villagers' praises,
...we really couldn't accept them.
Earlier when I was talking
to the villagers, even...
those eight thieves claimed to be
the Sword Kings.
But none of them is as good as
Master Fang.
Not at all.
All the clans have no objection.
Only Master Fang can rightly be
the Sword King.
After the fellow villagers
have heard that,
they've gathered all the goldsmiths
in town;
And after half a day's work,
we've made this gold medal for you.
I appreciate your goodwill
but don't deserve this.
Come on, let's drink to our Sword King.
Cheers.
Master Fang.
Did you ask your father about
what I spoke earlier?
Yes, my father does admit that
the Furtive King
...is indeed their chief.
But he has never seen him in action.
As regards his weapons,
...he has absolutely no idea.
This is getting very tricky.
Although we've destroyed their stronghold,
but we still haven't seen him...
or his sidekicks.
And no one has seen his Patrol Guards.
This can't be considered as over yet.
The seniors have just had their freedom.
I don't want to ruin their joy.
But I hope the young men will
keep on guard.
Tell them not to drink too much.
And the night guard shift is still on.
Yes.
Be careful.
Don't drink too much.
We've to be careful tonight.
I could hear it even over here.
They have such praises for you.
You should be happy.
One person getting fame over
thousands of dead bodies!
For this vain title,
how many lives have been sacrificed!
Because of that at least...
you should cherish it.
You've been trying to tell me something,
...but it keeps getting put back.
May I ask what it is?
I...I'm pregnant.
Really? Why didn't you tell me before?
Hereafter just lie down.
Don't move about heedlessly
Honestly, you're unbelievable!
I'll go and tell all of them.
Brother Lu, my wife is pregnant.
Hey, Mrs. Fang is pregnant.
Fellow brothers, let's have a drink.
Sure.
Congratulations, Master Fang!
Let's all raise a toast to you.
Patrol guards.
Here.
Let's split up.
Yes.
Uncle Mu, please go inside and sleep.
What about you?
I'm on night guard.
Where are you going?
Master Fang had a few drinks,
I'm worried, I just want to check outside.
Look at him!
Still wouldn't go to bed after the drinks.
Is everything alright?
Yes.
We have to be alert.
Brother Yin, it's my turn.
The enemies are here!
Let's forge ahead.
Master Fang.
Xiaoman, get up. Quick!
Those were my 8 anonymous guardians.
You must be the so-called Furtive King.
You intend facing me unarmed?
I know...you're the
one-armed swordsman Fang Gang.
Master Lu.
My child!
Dear!
Over there.
Move away!
Xiaoman, let's leave.
