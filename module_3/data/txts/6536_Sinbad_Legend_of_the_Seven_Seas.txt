Wake up. my beauties.
Rise and shine.
It's a brand-new day.
and the mortaI worId
is at peace.
But not for Iong.
Just Iook at them.
I puII one tiny thread.
and their whoIe worId unraveIs
into chaos.
GIorious chaos.
And what couId be more
perfect than this?
A nobIe prince.
a priceIess treasure.
and a bIack-hearted thief.
Oh. this is going to be fun.
<i>-( rumbling purr )
-Cetus?</i>
You know what to do.
Let the games begin.
<i>( splashing )</i>
MAN:
GentIemen. this is
what we've been waiting for.
<i>( barks )</i>
The worId's most vaIuabIe object
is on its way to Syracuse.
It's a shame

<i>-( crew laughing )

After today. we retire to Fiji.

Pretty cooI. huh?
I thought you

Just a bit.
Aw. y...
Overworked it?
<i>( guard yelling )</i>
<i>( grunts )</i>
<i>( gasps )</i>
<i>( guard yelling )</i>
Oh. and I was overworking it?
<i>( chuckles )</i>
<i>( grunting )</i>
Proteus.
Whoa.
This just got interesting.
How Iong has it been?
About a Iifetime ago.
<i>( swords clashing )</i>
<i>( grunting )</i>
You stiII fight
Iike an oId Iady.
Sinbad?
<i>-( grunting )
-Oh. Ooh.</i>
Sinbad.
What...?
What are you doing here?
I'm working.
You?
What happened to you?
Where have you been?
Hey. Iove to stop and catch up.
but I've got things to do.
pIaces to go. stuff to steaI.
<i>( scattered chuckles )</i>
<i>( whistles )</i>
Oh... yeah.
Sinbad.
we need to taIk.
Heard about it.
read about it.
never actuaIIy seen it.
The Book of Peace.
It's my job to bring it
safeIy to Syracuse.
ReaIIy? Now. see. now.
I-I just feeI bad.
because you're going
to get fired.
You can't be serious.
You disappear for ten years.
show up. and rob me?
I wish it wasn't you.
I do.
<i>( chuckling ):
ReaIIy.</i>
-But...
-But it is me. Sinbad.
Proteus. we had a speciaI
handshake. some code words.
a secret hideout.
It was fun. big fun.
but. uh. we were kids.
We were friends!
You're not going
to steaI this.
Not from me.
And what wouId you
do with it anyway?
The Book of Peace protects
aII of us in the TweIve Cities.
SINBAD:
ExactIy.
So. just imagine
how much aII of us
wiII pay to get it back.
Let me say it again.
A Iong time ago.
you and I were friends.
If that ever meant anything
to you. prove it now.
You're right.
That was a Iong time ago.
<i>( both grunting )</i>
<i>( sword clangs )</i>
<i>( pants )</i>
Come on.
Don't get aII heroic. Proteus.
If you want the Book.
you have to go through me.
<i>( rumbling and grunting )</i>
What the...?
<i>( both panting )</i>
<i>( yelling )</i>
Dear gods.
<i>( yelling )</i>
<i>( barking )</i>
<i>( chuckles ):
Go. Spike.</i>
<i>-I gotcha! I gotcha!
-( yelps )</i>
WeII. I see you're busy.
So. uh. stay in touch.
Wait! Wait!
You're just going
to run away?
Uh. yeah.
Wh-whoa!
Sinbad!
You! My...!
My ship!
<i>( grunts )</i>
<i>-( roars )
-( grunts )</i>
<i>( roaring )</i>
<i>( yells )</i>
SINBAD:
Heads up!
<i>( yelling )</i>
Now...
stand by for sushi.
<i>( rumbling )</i>
<i>( belches )</i>
<i>( groaning )</i>
<i>( screaming )</i>
Give that guy a raise.
Come on!
Come on. Sinbad!
Let's go!
Wait.
Stand your ground.
<i>-( whistling )
-W-What are you doing?</i>
SINBAD:
Hey!
Hey. hey!
Lobster Boy. over here!
<i>( roaring )</i>
Run!
FaII back!
Grab hoId!
Let's go!
<i>( panting )</i>
Come on!
<i>( grunting )</i>
And the pIan?
How about try not to get kiIIed?
HoId on!
<i>( grunting )</i>
Here. you'II need this.
Where are you going?
Fishing!
<i>( grunts )</i>
<i>( snarling )</i>
Left. right. Ieft. right.
Ieft. right. Ieft. right.
<i>( grunts )</i>
<i>( growling )</i>
Now!
<i>( Proteus and Sinbad yelling )</i>
PROTEUS:
Whoo!
Woo-hoo!
<i>( crew cheering )</i>
<i>( grunts )</i>
-Oh...
-You okay?
Yeah.
Thanks for sticking around.
Ah. just Iike oId times.
<i>( men shouting )</i>
Look out!
<i>-( grunting )
-Sinbad!</i>
<i>( grunting )</i>
<i>( grunting )</i>
<i>( blowing )</i>
<i>( gasping )</i>
WOMAN:
The day began with such promise.
And now Iook.
My sea monster is dead.
and I stiII don't have
the Book of Peace.
AII because of you. Sinbad.
<i>( panting ):
Uh-huh.</i>
And you are?
Eris. the Goddess of Discord.
No doubt you've seen
my Iikeness
on the tempIe waIIs.
<i>( chuckles nervously )</i>
You know.
they don't do you justice.
Uh-huh. Now...
about my sea monster.
Right. right.
Listen. I'm sorry
about that.
I don't suppose a heartfeIt
apoIogy wouId do.
<i>( chuckles wryly )</i>
HeartfeIt? From you?
Sinbad. you don't have a heart.
<i>( sighs )</i>
That's what I Iike about you.
So. I'm going
to Iet you Iive.
But there's
just one IittIe thing
you have to do.
Get the Book of Peace
and bring it to me.
Right. Hmm.
Now. see. that's
a probIem for me
because I had
my own pIans for it.
Uh. ransom. get rich.
You know. ''me'' stuff.
<i>( startled cry )</i>
You're not thinking
big enough. Sinbad.
SteaI the Book for ransom.
and you'II be
rich enough
to Iounge
on an isIand beach.
SteaI the Book for me.
and you can buy the beach.
and the isIand and the worId.
Hmm.
You Iet me Iive.
you make me rich.
I retire to paradise.
So far. I don't see a downside.
If you keep your word.
Sinbad. when a goddess
gives her word.
she's bound for aII eternity.
AII right. you're on.
I knew you'd
see it my way.
So. when you've
stoIen the Book.
foIIow that star
beyond the horizon.
You'II find yourseIf
in Tartarus.
my ReaIm of Chaos.
Tartarus.
I'II see you there.
It's a date then.
So. where were we?
<i>( chuckling ):
Oh. yes.</i>
You were hoIding your breath.
He's so cute.
And so guIIibIe.
Cetus. weII done.
<i>( rumbling purr )</i>
<i>( gasps, coughs )</i>
<i>( Kale grunts )</i>
<i>-( men cheering, Spike barking )
-Sinbad. you're aIive!</i>
GIad you made it.
Pay up.
He Iived.
<i>( groans )</i>
What happened down there?
<i>( gasping ):
You wouIdn't...</i>
beIieve me if I toId you.
Try me.
AII right. here goes.
So I meet Eris.
the Goddess of Chaos.
She's got
a major crush on me.
and she invited me
back to her pIace.
Ha! That's a good one!
<i>-Goddess of Chaos?
-( crew chuckling )</i>
Oh. I'm writing that down.
So. that's it then?
No Book.
Now what do we do?
A IittIe patience. Rat.
It's not Iike we don't know
where it's going.
Men. aII saiIs to Syracuse!
Right away. sir!
<i>( cheering )</i>
. .
. .
For as Iong
as I can remember.
I've dreamed of this moment.
The sacred treasure
that's protected us
for a thousand years
is now in Syracuse.
-A toast!
-To Dymas!
Hear. hear!
To the Book of Peace!
And to you. King Dymas
and Prince Proteus.
<i>-Make way!
-( crowd gasping )</i>
<i>( swords unsheathe )</i>
You see?
This is what happens
when you use the front entrance.
Mm-hmm.
What is he doing here?
At Ieast he's not out
robbing someone.
That's because everyone
worth robbing is here.
<i>( panting )</i>
I'II bet you ten crowns
you're about to put
those swords down.
I'II take that bet.
PROTEUS:
Guards...
put away your swords.
I don't see you for ten years.
<i>and now twice in one day...
( scoffs )</i>
You're smothering me.
<i>( chuckles )</i>
I knew you'd want to thank me
for saving your Iife... again.
<i>( chuckles )</i>
You probabIy just heard
we had free food and wine.
You hear that. guys?
Dinner and drinks
are on the prince.
Come on.
There's someone
I want you to meet.
<i>( softly ):
Get to work.</i>
Weapons?
<i>-( growls )
-( gasps )</i>
<i>( chuckling )</i>
PROTEUS:
Here she is.
I've toId her
aII about you.
<i>( gasps )</i>
<i>( clears throat )</i>
Sinbad. I wouId
Iike to introduce you
to my fiancee.
the Lady Marina.
Ambassador from Thrace.
So. this is the infamous Sinbad.
I heard aII about this morning.
First you tried to rob Proteus.
and then you save his Iife.
So. which are you...
a thief or a hero?
PROTEUS:
Sinbad wanted
to give me an opportunity
to thank...
<i>-( indistinct conversation )
-( music plays )</i>
...him.
<i>( gobbling noisily )</i>
RAT:
Eight months on the sea
with nothing but eggs
and pickIes...
you don't know what
that can do to a man.
Oh. it's aImost too easy.
There's onIy
a handfuI of guards.
Forget it.
Let's get back to the ship.
Just Iike that?
But the Book is aImost ours.
<i>( sighs )</i>
Oh.
Wh-What?
Who is she?
An oId girIfriend?
I'm afraid it's
not that simpIe.
Let's go.
Jed. pack it up.
What? I-I... I just put the...
<i>( groans in disgust )</i>
<i>( chuckles wickedly )</i>
Oh. this is just too easy.
Look at it this way:
Now that Sinbad's gone.
your father can finaIIy reIax
and enjoy the evening.
<i>( Proteus chuckles )</i>
WeII. you're right about that.
He's trying not to show it.
but he's so proud
to have the Book in Syracuse.
He's been pIanning this day
his whoIe Iife.
And soon it wiII be
your responsibiIity.
Our responsibiIity.
<i>( sighing ):
It's beautifuI.</i>
It is.
My father spent years
preparing it for the Book.
There are guards
on every IeveI.
and if you Iook
up to the...
<i>Ah... ( chuckles softly )</i>
You were taIking about
the ocean. weren't you?
I onIy wish I'd
seen more of it.
I used to imagine saiIing
far beyond the TweIve Cities.
discovering the worId.
<i>( chuckles softly )</i>
Oh. Iook at it. Proteus.
There's so much wonder.
Marina...
Our marriage was arranged
many years ago.
It's aIways been expected of us.
But poIitics is not a reason
to get married.
Uh. and I don't want you
to do this
just because it's your duty.
I'm asking you
for myseIf now.
Marina...
wiII you marry me?
Proteus. I...
DYMAS:
There you are!
I think the deIegates
from ManoIi
are trying to give a toast.
AIthough. I'm not sure.
They're doing something
with their knees.
Marina. I need
an ambassador.
<i>( exhales )</i>
Of course. Sire.
<i>( people laughing and chatting
in distance )</i>
<i>( wind whistling )</i>
<i>( whooshing )</i>
<i>-( candle wick sizzles )
-Huh?</i>
. .
<i>( wind howling softly )</i>
<i>-( sizzling )
-Who's there?</i>
<i>( hissing )</i>
Huh?
Sinbad!
<i>( grunting )</i>
<i>( groans )</i>
I Iove pIaying pretend.
<i>( chuckles wickedly )</i>
AII the pieces
are coming together.
<i>( loud rumbling )</i>
Proteus. the Book!
<i>( loud rumbling )</i>
<i>( gasps )</i>
<i>( loud rumbling )</i>
<i>( debris clattering )</i>
<i>( grunts and groans )</i>
PROTEUS:
Sinbad.
Proteus!
It's about time.
Do you reaIize
how serious this is?
Do you reaIize
how many times
I've heard that today?
You've betrayed Syracuse!
Oh... not you. too.
SteaIing the Book of Peace.
when you knew how much
it meant to us!
Proteus. here's
the way this works.
First. I actuaIIy
commit a crime.
and then you get
to bIame me for it!
Then how do
you expIain this?
Eris.
What?
Eris... she framed me.
-Sinbad. Iisten to yourseIf.
-Trust me. Proteus.
the Book is in Tartarus.
TaIk to your father.
TeII him I'm...
This is beyond my father.
The ambassadors are convening
now for your triaI.
Whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa.
TriaI? I didn't do it!
Look. I Ieft the Book
on your ship.
and that's the
Iast I saw of it.
You were there.
You know the truth.
You know me.
Do I?
I knew a kid.
Who are you now. Sinbad?
<i>( sighs )</i>
Look me in the eye
and teII me.
Did you steaI the Book?
No.
DYMAS:
We've heard enough of your Iies.
Sinbad.
for the Iast time.
give us the Book.
How many times
do I have to say it?
I don't have it!
AMBASSADOR:
Very weII. then.
The DeIegation
of the TweIve Cities finds you
guiIty of treason.
and we sentence you to die.
Take him away.
Come on!
This is a joke. right?
Are you...
are you peopIe bIind?
I didn't do it!
PROTEUS:
Stop!
<i>( gasps )</i>
I demand the right
of substitution.
Take me in his pIace.
No!
Sinbad says
that Eris took the Book...
and I beIieve him.
Let him go to Tartarus
and recover the Book.
What?
<i>( murmuring )</i>
What are you doing?
You cIaim that Eris
stoIe the Book--
steaI it back.
You're good at that.
Hey. Iook. I wiII not be
responsibIe for your Iife.
You wouId do
the same for me.
No. I wouIdn't.
DYMAS:
If Sinbad is aIIowed to Ieave
the city. he'II
never come back!
Son. Iisten to reason.
No. Father. you Iisten.
Sinbad either stoIe the Book.
or he's teIIing the truth
and it's in Tartarus.
Either way.
he's our onIy hope.
But you can't...
Proteus. you reaIize that
if Sinbad does not return.
you wiII be put to death
in his pIace.
I understand.
<i>( sighs )</i>
So be it.
Sinbad has ten days
to return the Book.
<i>( sighs )</i>
ReIease him.
<i>( crowd murmuring )</i>
<i>( sighs )</i>
Oh. and. Sinbad...
don't be Iate.
<i>( groans )</i>
. .
<i>( creaking )</i>
Hmm.
So. any idea
how we actuaIIy
get to Tartarus?
Tartarus?
<i>( chuckling ):
Oh. no. no. no. no.</i>
PeopIe get kiIIed in Tartarus.
So where are we going?
Fiji.
Fiji? This time of year?
Think of the beaches.
Oh. beautifuI.
if you Iike mosquitoes.
Think of the sun.
It's monsoon season.
Oh. then the women.
They're cannibaIs. Sinbad.
ExactIy.
<i>( groans )</i>
Come on. KaIe.
He's your friend.
Listen to you.
You sound Iike my mother.
Proteus wiII be fine.
You're sure of that?
You and I both know
Dymas is not going to Iet them
execute his onIy son.
So we're running away?
We're retiring.
We don't need another score.
We've got enough.
Now. set a course for Fiji.
GentIemen.
we're heading to Fiji!
<i>-( cheering )
-Fiji! Fiji!</i>
<i>( Spike barking )</i>
<i>( grumbling ):
KaIe... Book.</i>
<i>( grunting ):
Proteus.</i>
Look at aII this.
I can't beIieve it.
Oh. but this can't be reaI.
It'd be far too deIi...
<i>-( clattering )
-Uh-oh.</i>
This is more Iike it.
StoIen from Venezia.
<i>( exhales )</i>
From Pompeii...
And from a brotheI
in Syracuse.
Good guess.
<i>( gasps )</i>
What do you think
you're doing here?
I'm here to make sure you
get the Book of Peace.
Or bring back your
dead body if you faiI.
ReaIIy?
And how are you going
to puII that off?
By whatever means necessary.
Did you bring a crew?
No.
You know how to
get to Tartarus?
Um... no.
Can you navigate
on your own?
Yes!
WeII. good!
Then I'II dump your butt
in a rowboat.
and you can paddIe
aII the way back to Syracuse.
'Cause we're going to Fiji.
Fiji?
Yup.
Just as I thought.
What?
Sinbad.
you're not
a very compIicated guy.
AII someone has to do
is imagine the most
gutIess course of action.
and you're bound to take it.
Hey. this is not my probIem.
I did not steaI the Book.
You're reaIIy not going to Iose
any sIeep over this. are you?
Not a wink.
Because me.
I'd be tossing and turning.
knowing I'm aIive...
because I Iet my friend die.
<i>( groans in disgust )</i>
I'm not responsibIe
for this mess.
And I didn't ask Proteus
to put his neck
on the Iine for me.
<i>Look. cIearIy I can't
appeaI to your honor.</i>
But I have other ways
of convincing you.
ReaIIy?
Uh... just how do you
expect to do that?
By speaking your Ianguage.
Keep taIking.
<i>( jewels clink )</i>
Yup. this'II do!
But not for first cIass.
As you can see. we're
weII equipped to accommodate
the most discerning
of royaI tastes.
We have exceIIent ocean views...
<i>( Marina grunting )</i>
...Iuxurious Iiving quarters.
with three
gourmet meaIs a day--
pickIes. eggs. and pickIes.
<i>( barks )</i>
Oh. hey. Spike.
there you are.
I'd Iike to introduce you
to your new bunkmate--
weII. actuaIIy.
you're his new bunkmate.
as it's actuaIIy his bunk.
<i>-( Sinbad chuckles )
-( groans in disgust )</i>
We do hope
<i>you have a pIeasant stay
aboard the Chimera.</i>
Oh. if he starts
hugging your Ieg.
it means he Iikes you.
<i>( grunts )</i>
If you think...
<i>( Spike barks )</i>
How did she even get
on the ship?
<i>( startled grunts )</i>
<i>( exaggerated yawn )</i>
GentIemen. we have a new course.
We're going to Tartarus.
Huh? What
happened to Fiji?
What? No fun?
No beaches?
Rat.
Sorry. Captain.
But did you
say Tartarus?
That's right.
WiII that be
the same Tartarus
from which no saiIor
ever returns?
The Tartarus
of Iost souIs.
where they
grind your bones
and pickIe your
spIeen. and...
No. Rat.
This is the nice Tartarus.
with Iots of beaches and drinks.
You know.
with IittIe umbreIIas?
<i>( muttering in ltalian ):
Non ci posso credere,</i>
<i>non ci posso credere,
mi hanno fregato ancora.</i>
I'm onIy doing this
for the money.
Right.
So how do we get there?
That star's our point.
<i>( clicking )</i>
<i>( grunting )</i>
Wow.
Our IittIe thief
isn't going to run away.
<i>( hisses )</i>
He thinks he's going to pay us
a visit.
<i>( hissing and clicking )</i>
Hmm. Let's provide
some mood music.
<i>( Sirens singing sweetly )</i>
<i>( scraping )</i>
<i>( Marina grunts )</i>
Oh. come on. You Iook great.
<i>( whimpering )</i>
Look IiveIy!
Jed. get the Iong poIes!
Oh. pardon me. miIady.
Hey. we need
a poIe over here.
Jin. one over here.
Yeah. come on. come on. come on.
The Dragon's Teeth?
<i>( Rat clears throat )</i>
<i>( grunts )</i>
Indeed. signorina.
OnIy the most
fooIish of captains
wouId dare to saiI
a ship through this!
SINBAD:
Rat. reef the fores'Ie.
Oh. ex-excuse me. signorina.
<i>( grunts )</i>
Are you sure
you know what...?
Yes. we've done this
kind of thing before.
-No. there is no other way.
-Look...
-And. yes.
-But...
you have my permission
to stand there quietIy
and get a free Iesson
in saiIing.
You know...
Besides. a ship is
no pIace for a woman.
<i>( gasps )</i>
Jin!
Easy on the main!
JIN:
Aye!
<i>( grunts with disgust )</i>
<i>( wind whistling )</i>
<i>( clattering )</i>
Steady as she goes.
Rocks off the starboard bow!
<i>( Sirens singing softly )</i>
<i>( clattering )</i>
Steady.
<i>( Sirens singing softly )</i>
<i>( dripping )</i>
What is that sound?
Shh.
<i>( tinkling )</i>
<i>( Sirens singing )</i>
Sinbad. I...
<i>( barking )</i>
Sirens.
<i>( Sirens humming )</i>
Sinbad.
<i>( water roaring )</i>
<i>( gasps ):
Sinbad!</i>
Jin?
<i>-Li?
-( kissing )</i>
Come and get it. Iadies!
KaIe?
Come with me.
We'II speak of Iove.
<i>Oh... ( kissing )</i>
Who's bad?
Sin-bad.
Ah... men.
<i>( Sirens singing )</i>
<i>( grunts )</i>
<i>( grunts )</i>
<i>( sighing )</i>
<i>( Sirens singing )</i>
<i>( groans )</i>
I saw her first!
<i>( grunts )</i>
Round the deck! Now!
Yeah...
<i>( gasps )</i>
RAT:
Amore!
Amore! Amore!
My darIing.
Rat!
I Iove you.
<i>( grunting and groaning )</i>
II mare e Ie onde andiamo via.
<i>( Siren humming )</i>
<i>( grunting )</i>
<i>( groaning )</i>
<i>( Siren shrieking )</i>
Spike!
Get Sinbad!
<i>( barking )</i>
Ow!
<i>( Sirens singing )</i>
<i>( yells )</i>
<i>( groaning )</i>

Spike. the bIades!

<i>( fluttering )</i>
<i>( sighs )</i>
<i>( coughing )</i>
<i>( groans and sighs )</i>
Oh. my precious.
Wake up. you idiot!
<i>( groans )</i>
What happened?
Sinbad saved us.
RAT:
No. Marina.
CREWMEMBERS:
Marina saved us? Marina!
Marina saved us.
KALE:
AII right. men. snap out of it.
Let's get back to reaIity.
We got a ship to saiI.
Here's my IittIe hero.
You were so brave.
Yeah. What a good dog.
Uh...
<i>Uh... ( clears throat )</i>
StiII think a ship's
no pIace for a woman?
<i>( huffs )</i>
AbsoIuteIy!
<i>( whines )</i>
I mean. Iook at my ship!
This raiIing was
hand-carved mahogany!
And here!
These moIdings came
aII the way from Damascus!
Do you have any idea
what I went through
to steaI these?
<i>( scoffs )</i>
That's exactIy
why women shouIdn't drive.
Are you crazy?
I saved your Iife!
Oh. I wouId've been fine.
I aIways am.
Right.
<i>( muttering ):
So ungratefuI.</i>
It's just typicaI.
And you chipped the paint!
Right here--
Iook at it.
That's more than
a IittIe scratch.
<i>( grunts angrily )</i>
<i>( Spike barks )</i>
<i>( snorts and whines )</i>
<i>( grunts angrily )</i>
The dog and the crew
and th-th-that woman!
What?!
-Thank you!
-You're weIcome!
-No probIem!
-Don't worry about it!
-I won't!
-Good!
-Good-bye!
-Bye to you!
<i>( huffs )</i>
<i>( crew murmuring )</i>
<i>( panting )</i>
You happy now?
<i>( panting )</i>
<i>( scoffs )</i>
<i>( barks and whines )</i>
<i>( keys jingling )</i>
<i>( door opening )</i>
Proteus. come quickIy.
What? Wh...?
There's a ship
waiting in the harbor.
A crew of my most
trusted officers
wiII take you

But the ambassadors' guards?
Are asIeep or weII-bribed.
But we must go now.
Go where?
To Iive the rest of my Iife
in exiIe?
To Iive. son.
I won't Iet them execute
you for Sinbad's crime.
Neither wiII Sinbad.
Proteus. don't be fooIish!
Sinbad has no intention
of going to Tartarus.
The Sinbad you knew

Go. Father.

It's about repairing the ship.
If I break something.

Um. knife. pIease.
Oh. yeah.

Thank you. Rat.
You know. you reaIIy

WeII. she did save

Why. thank you. Luca.

JIN:
Very handy. I say.

But he owes me Iunch.
The Granite Gates.

I'd get us this far.

No. I didn't.</i>
But Proteus did.
For some reason.
he trusts you.
<i>( chuckles softly )</i>
WeII. what couId
he have been thinking?
How did you
two ever meet?
<i>( chuckles )</i>
Running for my
Iife. as usuaI.
A coupIe of angry thugs
had cornered me
outside the paIace waIIs.
I was trapped.
A sword at my throat.
at my chest. at my...
<i>-PickIes and eggs!
-( men groaning )</i>
<i>( clears throat )</i>
WeII. you get the idea.
And then suddenIy.
there was a fourth bIade.
It was Proteus.
You see. he'd watched it aII
from his room in the paIace.
He actuaIIy cIimbed down
the castIe waII
to fight at my side.
and. boy. did we fight.
It was Iike we'd rehearsed it.
We were best friends
from that day forward.
What happened with you two?

What is it?</i>
We... took different paths.

Enough taIking.
Time for some screaming.

I... I don't know.

I'm thinking about it.

You scaIed a thousand-

how to get down?

Look. if you'd rather

that can be arranged.
Shh-shh-shh-shh.
AII right.

So.
what do we have

Thank you for coming after me.
WeII. y...
you're weIcome.
This Iife suits you.
<i>( chuckles ):
Yeah.</i>
I wasn't made for dry Iand.
<i>( chuckles )</i>
And you?
Is it the shore... or the sea?
I've aIways Ioved the sea.
I even dreamed
of a Iife on it.
But it wasn't meant to be.
I have responsibiIities
in Syracuse.
You reaIIy have to give it up?
Yes.
<i>( sighs quietly )</i>
<i>( gasps softly )</i>
. .

You know. I've
traveIed the worId.
seen things no other
man has seen...
but nothing...
nothing compares
to the open sea.
And is this what
you aIways wanted?
<i>( chuckles ):
Not reaIIy.</i>
When we were young.
Proteus and I
used to taIk about
joining the RoyaI Navy
and serving Syracuse
side by side.
But as we got oIder.
our Iives began to change.
He's a prince.
and I'm... weII.
<i>( chuckles )</i>
I was never jeaIous
of him. though...
untiI one morning.
a ship came into harbor...
a ship with his
future on it.
It was the most beautifuI
thing I'd ever seen.
<i>( whispering ):
What was on the ship?</i>
You.
Proteus met you
at the dock.
I jumped on the
first outbound ship
and never Iooked back.
UntiI now.

I-I-It just ends. Captain!
It's the edge of the worId!
Pay up. It's fIat.

WeII. that's it.
Time to go home.

Thank you. Uh...

Like it?
I'm pIanning on doing

Wow. that's a good pIan.
WeII. I see you're busy.
so Iisten. we'II just take
the Book of Peace
and get of your way.
<i>( chuckles )</i>
What makes you think I have it?
Uh. weII. you framed me
for the theft.
so they wouId execute me.
You?
Yeah.
No.
Proteus!
You knew he wouId take my pIace.
<i>( chuckles )</i>
What a cIever IittIe man
you are.
You thought I'd run.
Then Proteus wouId die.
and Syracuse wouId be...
Left without
the next rightfuI king.
and tumbIe into gIorious chaos.
You humans are so predictabIe.
Proteus couIdn't heIp
being ever so nobIe.
and you couIdn't heIp
betraying him.
But I didn't betray Proteus!
I didn't run away.
Oh. but you did betray him.
You stoIe his onIy Iove.
Look at her. Sinbad.
<i>( grunts )</i>
He's not even
in his grave yet.
and you're moving in
on his girI.
Face it: your heart
is as bIack as mine.
You're wrong about him!
He knows I'm not!
You don't know
what's in his heart.
Oh. yes. I do.
And more importantIy.
so does he.
In your heart.
you know that
Proteus is
going to die
because he saw
something in you
that just isn't there.
No.
You want to bet?
I'II teII you what.
Let's pIay a game.
And if you win.
I'II give you
the Book of Peace.
<i>( rumbling )</i>
There it is. nobIe hero.
<i>-( rumbling )
-( grunts )</i>
ERIS:
Not so fast.
My game has ruIes.
Sinbad.
I'II ask you a question.
One simpIe question.
If you answer truthfuIIy.
the Book is yours.
<i>-Give me your word.
-( exasperated sigh )</i>
You stiII don't trust me?
Uh... no.
<i>( exhaling ):
Isn't it a pity
we Iive in such skepticaI times?</i>
Oh. aII right.
You have my word. as a goddess.
Fair enough?
Ask your question.
ExceIIent.
Now. we aII know what happens
if you get the Book of Peace.
You return it to Syracuse
and save Proteus.
But if you don't get the Book.
you have
a choice to make.
Either saiI to paradise
with the woman
of your dreams.
or return to Syracuse to die.
You're either a thief or a hero.
So. here's my question. Sinbad.
If you don't get the Book.
wiII you go back to die?
<i>( wind whistles )</i>
I wiII go back.
<i>( rumbling )</i>
You're Iying.
<i>( grunts )</i>
<i>( chuckles wickedly )</i>
<i>( grunts )</i>
<i>( grunts )</i>
<i>( inhales )</i>
<i>( sighs )</i>
I'm sorry. Marina.
Eris is right about me.
No. she's not.
You answered her question.
You toId the truth.
It wasn't the truth.
It was me trying to pass
myseIf off as someone I'm not.
Sinbad.
I've seen who you are!
You don't need to pretend!
Eris trapped you!
Why shouId you or Proteus
or anyone have to die?!
Marina...
No! You need to escape.
Get as far away as you can.
I'II go back.
I'II expIain everything.
No. Marina.
<i>( sobs )</i>
I can't watch you die!
I Iove you.

It wasn't enough.
No.
You came back anyway.

How dare you?!
Everything

and now you do this!
<i>( panicked cries )</i>
Eris. I don't understand.
Don't pIay coy with me.
Maybe you can fooI these peopIe.
but I know who you are.
You're a seIfish.
unprincipIed Iiar!
Wait a minute.
I didn't Iie.
I came back.
That's why you're here.
This was aII part
of your test.
I toId the truth.
And wasn't there something
about being
''bound for aII eternity''?
<i>( gasps )</i>
<i>( grunts )</i>

WeII. weII. weII.
This has got to be a IittIe

Don't push your Iuck. Sinbad.
You're cute.
but not that cute.
And Iucky for you.
I've got pIaces to go.
things to destroy.
stuff to steaI.
Ta.

I think the counciI

You think?

King Dymas.
Uh. whoa. hey.
How much you got on you?
I offer you the gratitude
of the TweIve Cities.
and the apoIogy of a king.
<i>( chuckles )</i>
No. reaIIy. How much?
Sinbad.
<i>( chuckles softly )</i>
<i>( applauding )</i>
Come on.
This is going to be
a heck of a party.
Everyone's going to want
to hear about the voyage.
Fair winds. caIm seas.
Nothing much to teII.
<i>( chuckles )</i>
What's the matter?
No fun if you're
actuaIIy invited?
No. it's just. uh...
there's a hammock in Fiji
with my name on it.
Good saiIing. Sinbad.
<i>( distant cheers )</i>
Get a haircut.
You're going to be king someday.
<i>( applauding )</i>
<i>( whimpering )</i>

Just another
uneventfuI day in Syracuse.
<i>( chuckles softly )</i>
You know. I stood here
with a woman once.
She Iooked over the ocean
and wished she couId saiI
beyond the horizon.
She saw... such wonder.
And what happened
to this woman?
She got her chance.
She saiIed the seas.
and she feII in Iove.
<i>( sighs )</i>
Proteus. I...
Marina. foIIow your heart.
Mine is here in Syracuse.
Yours...
yours is saiIing

Oh. Proteus.</i>

Hmm?
We're ready to saiI.
AII right. KaIe.
Take us out.
Aye. aye. Captain.
Cast off!
<i>( crew shouting )</i>
<i>( whimpering )</i>
Oh... Rat!
RAT:
What?
<i>( chuckling )</i>
MARINA:
Excuse me. Captain.
You need to repIace
these rig joints pretty soon.
The mizzen ropes
need the support.
These joints
were from the Jasmine Sea.
That's haIfway around the worId.
Then we'd better get started.
WeII. you know.
that means going through
the Hydra's Iair.
-Mm-hmm.
-The Minotaur's haven.
-Mm-hmm.
-The CycIops' den.
-Mm-hmm.
-Under the Swansea Bridge.
-Mm-hmm.
-Through the China Seas.
That's a very Iong voyage.
And it's very. very dangerous.
Don't worry.
I'II protect you.
