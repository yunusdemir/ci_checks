MAN: All right,

you know what I'm sayin',
for this
New Jersey Drive joint.
All right!
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(GATE UNLOCKING)
OFFICER:
How you doin'?
(INMATES SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY)
Third one on your left.
Enjoy your stay.
(BANGING)
(INMATES CLAMORING)
JAY: I remember when my mom
used to always talk about
how she wanted
to live in peace somewhere.
For her, it wasn't about
cars, money or a new house.
She just wanted to be
able to live somewhere
where it was quiet,
calm and peaceful.
That was
a long time ago.
I remember
when me and Midget
was just little kids.
We used to watch
his older brothers go
out and snatch a car
just for joyrides
around the block.
(CAR ALARM SOUNDING)
We couldn't wait
'til it was our turn
to get behind the wheel.
(ALARM STOPS)
(ENGINE STARTING)
It didn't matter
what it was.
It could've been
a Lexus, a Camry, a Ford.
Didn't matter.
It was all good.
NEWSCASTER: It's become
a tradition in this city
of half a million souls.
The reasons are many.
But whatever the reasons,
the port of New Jersey
has become the car-theft
capital of the world.
On a nightly basis,
you'll find
the streets alive
with the sounds
of engines screaming
and carloads of
kids in flashy imports
racing down the avenues
acting out their anger.
JAY: By the time we got
back on Hawthorne Ave.,
everybody had a ride.
Jamal, Ritchie, P-Nut,
Tiny Dime, everybody.
We was just out there
puttin' on a show.
Blowin' up the spot.
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
GIRL: What's up?
(GIRLS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
You ain't called me
last night, what's up?
(HIP-HOP SONG PLAYING)
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(POLICE SIRENS WAILING)
JAY: It was about
3:00 in the morning when
I hooked up with Ron Q.
We had nothing
special in mind.
Just a stereo and
a .440 under the hood.
She was live, right.
Right.
Motherfuckers hadn't
seen years out of
their record shit, boy.
Turned out phat, though.
Hell, yeah. Yeah.
I told you
them niggers
is buggin'.
Tell the motherfuckers
against 'em on all
four sides and shit.
I definitely
had to bail out.
Motherfuckers
tried to roll up on me.
Had to show them
motherfuckers mad skills, boy.
Left the motherfuckers
in the dust.
(LAUGHING)
OFFICER: Heads up,
heads up, fellas.
Here we go.
You heard about
that nigger, Troy?
What, that
he got sent up?
Yo, that man

OFFICER:
Look lively, you're up.
Let's get ready, guys.
OFFICER:
Roscoe, that's your car.
Motherfucker!
If I ever see another judge,
my ass is out. I might as
well start packin' it up.
Don't be sweatin' that.
It ain't no thing.
They send you up,

that's all.
OFFICER: Front left. Go!
(GUNSHOT PUNCTURES TIRE)
Oh, shit.
What the fuck
was that, man?
RON Q: Hold on.
Let me pull this shit over.
OFFICER: That's
a bull's-eye, buddy.
(OFFICERS LAUGHING)
OFFICER:
One for the good guys.
(GUN FIRES)
Oh, shit!
(YELLING) Holy shit, man!
Oh, shit!
Come on!
(SIRENS WAILING)
Get up!
I'm shot, Jay.
RON Q: Oh, shit, man.
OFFICER 1: One of 'em
went this way.
OFFICER 2:
Get a light down there.
RADIO DISPATCHER:
Units 5 and 6, we have reports
of shots fired in your area.
Units 5 and 6,
please respond.
You all right, man?
You all right, right?
They shot me.
They goddamn shot me.
We got to go upstairs.
Look at this shit.

Aw, man, you got

And they shot you

(SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
Get him up!
Get him upstairs!
Get him...
Pick him the fuck up!
Pick him up!
JAY: They hit Ronnie
with something nasty.
He kept telling me
he didn't want to
go upstairs.
'Cause his mom would
kill him for gettin' shot.
NEWSCASTER: ...the ongoing
tensions between police
and Newark car thieves.
Last night,
17-year-old Ronald Lambs
was shot and
critically wounded
while sitting in
a stolen car in Newark.
The police statement
claim the officers
were fired upon first
after they ordered
the youth to surrender.
There have been reports
that the car belonged
to a Newark policeman.
Many residents
in the area
are convinced
that the police
shot Mr. Lambs
out of revenge.
No weapon has been found.
(ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
So they was squattin'
up there waitin' for us.
I'm tellin' you, man,
shots was goin' off,
glass was flyin'.
Shit hit the fan, man.
I'm tellin' you.
I don't know how my man
got by. That nigger was out.
Straight up cold.
'Cause them motherfuckin'
police put a bullet
in that nigger's ass.
You know what I'm sayin'.
That's my man. We need to go
check that nigger out.
Let's check
that nigger out today.
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'll bring the Buddha
and we'll get that nigger.
Look what they did to Pico.
They put caps in that
nigger's back for no reason.
They hit my man
off some mess.
Black man.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Black man.
Talking about
my man had a gun.
My man didn't have no gun.
You know what I'm sayin'?
It's open season on
the black man out here.
Kid, I'll tell you.
Fuck all that
open season shit.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Fuck that.
You got to be quicker
than them motherfuckers.
You know what
I'm sayin'?
You're quicker
than a Smith & Wesson,
ain't you, motherfucker?
Fuck the motherfucker
Smith & Wesson.
By that time, they start
cappin' niggers anyway.
You know what I'm saying?
That's what
you're gonna do?
I thought you knew.
My heart don't
pump no lemonade.
(ALL CONTINUE SPEAKING)
Yo, here come Coreen.
Hey.
Yeah, yeah.
So come here
for a minute.
Oh, you ain't gonna say
nothin' right now?
It's like that?
You go, girl. Keep going.
I'm talkin' to you.
Where you goin'?
All right.
All right.
JAY: Next day,
they put on a little show
of their own for us.
Flexing their muscles.
Trying to let everybody know
who's in charge.
You're always coming around.
It's like a little war
we got right here in
our own backyard.
Why don't you go back
to your own neighborhood?
And there was always one
who seemed to like his job
a little bit too much.
I know him.
Roll him.
Let me see his face.
Let me see his face. Roll.
What's goin' on, man? Yo!
What the fuck
is wrong with you all?
Why you stressin' my man?
TINY: Yo, what's up
with you police?
Why you pullin'
on him like that?
You all like
shooting people, right?
Why don't you
shoot one of us?
OFFICER: We might.
You might?
Yo, you're gonna have
to shoot us all, punk ass!
Sellout motherfucker.
OFFICER ON RADIO:
We're holding them now.
Please check for warrants.
Over.
I thought that they were gonna
snuff you or somethin'.
You know what's up
with him, right?
That nigger know
he saw me.
Fuck, man.
Put some money on it.
That's the motherfuckers
shot Ron Q.
JAY: I hadn't seen my mom
since the day before.
What's up, Mama?
So I knew she'd be angry.
My little sister was good
in lettin' her
know my business.
Now, sit down,
will you?
I didn't say go in there.
I said, sit down.
What's up, Ma?
Sit down.
What's up?
What's up with you?
Don't eat all of them.
I ain't.
I ain't?
I'm not, Ma.
You know Ronnie Lambs is
in the hospital?
Yeah, I know.
You know what
happened to him?
Yeah, I know about that.
Of course you do.
Were you with him?
No, I wasn't with him.
Oh, you weren't there?
Then how you
know about it then?
He told me about it
last night.
Oh, you just
heard about it?
I heard about
something too.
These police aren't gonna
play with you anymore.
You know, they shot
that kid for no reason?
Oh, you need a reason to
get shot nowadays, Jason?
I don't think so.
Look at me.
I don't wanna get
that call, okay?
Now, you stay away
from those police because
they will use their guns.
What the hell
happened to you?
You want something?
Nugget said you was with that
nigger when they shot him.
Fuck Nugget know?
You see that ring
he bought her?
Yeah, I saw it.
He better not
try and marry her.
He will.
Well, I ain't
livin' with him.
Are you done already?
Am I done? You got that
magazine there actin' like
you can read or something.
Am I done?
I can kick your little ass.
Go upstairs.
What's wrong with you?
Yeah, okay, whatever, Jason.
Fuckin' sticks and bones.
I'm about to break that ass.
(POUNDING ON DOOR)
Hello, young lady.
And what would your name be?
Ma!
RADIO DISPATCHER:
We have the description.
Plate number
Robert-Harvey-Thomas, 3-3-9.
Driver is a male black,
late teens.
Red hoodie, white pants.
Last seen in the vicinity
of North Irving.
Did you know
he had stolen the car?
I knew
it wasn't Ron Q's.
Did he tell you
he had stolen it?
No, we was just ridin'.
If it was stolen,
it was stolen.
Made no
difference to you?
No.
Now, did you hear
any gunshots?
Yeah, I heard gunshots.
And how many did you
think you heard?
I didn't think.
I know I heard four shots.
Now, did you see
anybody shooting?
I mean, anybody actually
firing a weapon.
Did I see
the police shoot him?
Did you?
The police was
the only ones out there.
Was there a gun?
Who had the gun?
Ain't nobody had no guns.
What about Ronnie?
Ain't nobody had no guns.
You didn't see him with a gun
earlier in the evening?
No.
Were you with him
earlier in the evening?
Yeah.
Well, no. I don't know.
Listen, I know
ain't nobody had no gun
and the police shot him.
But he might've had one
and not told you?
You all can say
what you all want,
but ain't nobody had no guns.
That's all I got
to say about it.
Now, do you think
you can identify the officer
you saw firing his weapon?
JAY: So they had me
in there all morning.
Asking me questions.
Talking like there's gonna be
an investigation or something.
Come on, man.
What they gonna do?
Lock up some cop for me?
(CAMERA SHOOTING)
MIDGET:
Look at this brother.
You think he's sleeping, man?
My man ain't
even breathing, man.
Wake up. Hey, Ron.
This nigger's dead.
Word up, yo.
(GROGGILY)
Nah, man.
I'm alive, motherfucker.
What you think, man?
Yo, how you feel, Q?
You feel all right?
Yeah, man, I'm all right.
I'm all right.
Did that shit hurt, Q?
I know that shit hurt.
It felt like a truck
and shit, man.
Except now they got me on
heroin or some shit.
(ALL LAUGH)
TINY: You look
high as hell, right?
You know you made
the news, right?
True.
MIDGET: Word up.
To tell you the truth,
I don't give
a fuck about all that.
All I wanna do is get
the fuck out of here.
Straight up, B.
JAY: My court dates were
so backed up that week,
I hardly had any time
left for school.
(INDISTINCT)
Sometimes you had to
stand around all morning
when you got there.
And you always
run into a familiar face.
JUDGE: Okay, Counsel.
I have to tell you.
I don't see any circumstances
in this particular case
that would warrant me
to dismiss these charges.
Any other investigations
and pending legal action
has no bearing on the charges
presented in this court.
Mr. Petty, you're now going
to see more of Mr. McHenry.
I sentence you
to two years probation.
If you come before me again,
I'll have no choice
but to send you
to the Franklin James
Burke School for Boys.
Have you heard
about that institution?
Yes, sir.
I thought so.
In a year, you'll have
the privileges of an adult.
Now, if you continue
on this trend,
I'll have no choice
but to sentence you
to serve time there.
Now, let me just add this.
I've seen far too many
young men such as
yourself come before me
in these last 12 years
since I've had the privilege
of sitting at this bench.
Far too many young men.
Now, society tells us
that these young men
are criminals,
hoodlums, animals.
What I see every day
are confused children
trying to find their way
through a harsh and
unforgiving world.
JAY: Back at school,
I had to wait outside
a half an hour
because the metal detectors
weren't working.
Then somebody
pulled the fire alarm.
At that point,
I just called it a day.
So what are they doin'?
Fuckin' with me.
Givin' me the runaround.
The police
tried to smoke me.
Tryin' to lock me up.
Well,
you know it ain't
the first time.
You should see Ron Q.
You lucky you ain't
in the hospital
right with him.
Lucky I ain't dead, man.
Fuck the hospital...
(CAR BRAKES SCREECH)
What's up?
MIDGET: What happened to you?
Just stay away from them.
What's up, girl?
Hey, Tiny.
How you doin'?
Ain't nobody
avoiding you, Midget.
I see in that top
you got it goin' on.
Yeah, and you can't do
nothin' with it, Tiny.
I want to get with you,
girl.
Stop playin' yourself.
Why don't you come
for a ride with us?
I ain't goin' with you.
Come on, man.
TINY: Yo, I'm just sayin'...
I don't believe you're
gonna leave me for them.
TINY: I'll let you
sit on my lap.
You comin'?
COREEN: No.
You're gonna leave me
and go with them?
TINY: Motherfucker's in.
COREEN: I don't believe you.
Yo, Midget.
TINY: Midget,

You're comin' through, man.
What's up

I understand, I understand.
This shit is butter.
You should've seen it.
You know what I'm sayin'?

Let me ask you something.
You know what a grand jury is?
You ever hear of a grand jury?
Nah, I don't know

Excuse me?

We're not no fools.
We know all about you

You ain't got to worry

No, now it is

I am makin' it my business.
You got a problem with that?
You're funny, man.
No, I'm not funny

This ain't

I ain't playin' no game.
I ain't either.
And if you think

(SCOFFS) You got another

No, man, you can just stop
the bus right there, man.
I ain't tryin'

No, you're not

Excuse me. Excuse me, Mom,

Can I talk to my friends?
No, you ain't

NEWS ANNOUNCER:
In Newark today,
investigators are hoping
to uncover some more
clues in the shooting
of 17-year-old
Ronald Lambs.
He was allegedly shot
by police a month ago,
here in Newark.
At 9:00 this morning,
the first witnesses
were brought in
to testify
before a grand jury.
JAY: Ronnie was
still in the hospital
when they finally
brought me in on
that grand jury.
So much has happened
since then,
it was like talking
about ancient history.
No way could you
bring any of it back.
There has been
lots of speculation
since 17-year-old
Ronald Lambs was
shot last month.
He was critically wounded
here in Newark after
stepping out of a stolen car
that apparently belonged
to one of the officers
involved in the shooting.
Oh, ow! That's that beast
that bagged me, man!
Check this nigger!
MAN: That's the nigger
that bagged me, too!
The officer has admitted
that there was some
wrongdoing on his part.
He has admitted that
he was not correct...
Shit in the barrel, boy!
You're comin' home, boy!
The officers involved
have been suspended
from duty pending
an investigation.

Emil Roscoe
of Glen Ridge,
is now facing
criminal charges.

NEWS REPORTER:
In the news tonight,
a high-speed chase
from Newark to Hill Vale,
New Jersey, turned deadly
after police opened fire
on a stolen van filled
mostly with teenagers.
The chase began in Newark
after police
officers spotted a van,
which had been stolen
at gunpoint a day earlier.
The van took off
at high speed.
Newark police followed it
to Hill Vale.
At a bridge on
North Brown Street,
a police car blocked
the van's path,
but the driver
did not stop.
What happened next
is unclear.
Police won't give details
until their investigation
is complete,
but they say
some 30 shots were
fired at the van.
When it was over,
two people were dead,
and three others had
been hit by gunfire.
One of the dead was
a pregnant teenage girl.
In all, six people
were in the van.
Police also say they found
a starter's pistol
on the floor of the van.
It was not, however,
the weapon used
when the van was stolen.
Police are preparing
a long list
of charges now.
POLICE OFFICER: At this point,
I guess some of them will be
armed robbery,
conspiracy to
commit robbery,
auto theft,
aggravated assault
on police officers,
eluding police
and resisting arrest.
What's up?
What's up, nigger?
(LAUGHING)
JAY: I guess
the house
is quiet now.
And up and down the block,
you don't see anybody anymore.
It's almost like
we were never there.
We was just tryin'
to make our mark

find something
we can call our own.
And if
I've changed at all,
it's only because
I've seen too much.
