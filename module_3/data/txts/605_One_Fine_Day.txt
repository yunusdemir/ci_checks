One fine day
You'll look at me
And then you'll know our love was
Meant to be
One fine day
You're gonna want me
For your girl
The arms I long for
Will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me
Right by your side
One fine day
You're gonna want me
For your girl
Oh, now I know you're
The kind of a boy
Who only wants to run around
I'll keep waiting
And someday, darlin'
You'll come to me
When you want to settle down
One fine day
We'll meet once more
And then you'll want the love
You threw away before
One fine day
You're gonna want me
And one fine day
You're gonna want me
And one fine day
You're gonna want me
For your girl
I heard that my,
my son Dave Jr.
You met Dave Jr. on the last...
This is great news.
I heard, now,
I was notified Sunday that Dave Jr.
Will be tried as a juvenile
for grand theft auto.
Oh, congratulations.
Great news. Great...
911!
911!
Mommy.
Mom.
I'm really thirsty, Mommy.
Okay.
Okay? Okay, sweetie.
Good night.
Wait. There's one more sip left.
Half a sip. You don't need it.
Good night.
I do need it.
I do need it, Mommy.
Okay.
Now good night for real. Okay?
Good night, Mom.
Night-night, honey.
I'm real excited about
the field trip tomorrow.
I love big boats.
That's good.
The Circle Line is big, right?
Yeah.
Good.
Mom?
It's sleepy time now.
Is Daddy coming to
my soccer game tomorrow?
He's gonna try, Sammy.
Honey, do you remember
when I explained to you
that Daddy has a different schedule
than a lot of other daddies?
Yeah.
Well, musicians,
they don't always know
exactly when they're
going to get a chance to play,
so, there's a chance
he might not come tomorrow.
But he's gonna try.
Yeah. He's gonna try.
I love you a million,
billion, zillion.
Do you love him?
Mommy?
I will always love your daddy
because he gave me you.
Now go to sleep.
I can't sleep, Mom.
I had a bad dream.
In just two minutes,
you already fell asleep
and had a bad dream?
Oh, sweetie.
Oh, shoot!
I don't even think I knew her.
I had no idea. I divorced her.
Hi, Jack.
- Hi.
- Dad!
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hey! I got you!
Watch your step.
Maggie, be careful!
I do it all the time, Mom.
- Does it all the time.
- I can't believe
you still haven't gotten
the plumbing fixed, Jack.
So what's up, Kristen?
You know that me and Greg
got married last Saturday.
Oh, yeah. How's Greg?
He's downstairs waiting
in the car with an ulcer
hoping you'll say yes.
I need you to
watch Maggie for me.
Okay. Yeah. I can do that
till about 6:00.
Would that help?
- Well...
- No.
For the whole week, Daddy.
The whole week.
We were scheduled
to leave this morning
on our honeymoon,
but the nanny called to say
that she's got to
go watch her mother
have a benign tumor
removed in Ohio.
Greg's parents are too old.
Mine are too, too crazy.
Yours are dead.
The tickets are nonrefundable.
So that leaves you.
- Okay. Kristen, I would love to...
- Do this, please!
But, you know,
I'm working on a story right now.
You're always working on a story.
Well, yeah. It's what I do.
It's the same old one
about an every-other-weekend,
good-time father
for whom responsibility
is a dirty word.
Here's a hint, Kristen.
During an attempted manipulation,
like the one that's in progress,
I would've gone with flattery.
Why do I always
have to be the grownup
where you always get
to be the little boy?
'Cause in the beginning
of the relationship
when we were choosing up sides,
you chose grownup first.
This is how you
really want it, Kristen.
No. What I really want
is just once for you
to make a sacrifice
Come here, my little noodle.
My little creature.
Go pee.
And wash your hands and face
and brush your teeth.
We're in a little bit
of a hurry this morning
'cause we have to take your
friend Maggie to school,
and we can't be late
because of your field trip.
I hate Maggie.
She thinks she's so funny.
Maggie.
Hey, Jack,
here's Maggie's doctor's number
and the number of
a really good baby-sitter
who can help you out tomorrow.
She's got a walk-on part
on a soap today.
And there's one last thing.
This is really important.
My neighbor was
supposed to take Maggie
to the Westside Montessori School
for me this morning.
Okay? She lives in my building.
- Jack. Jack?
- Upp. Hupp!
Apartment 501.
This is her number.
Okay.
Her name is Melanie Parker.
Now, if you want her to take
Maggie to school for you...
If you want her to take
Maggie to school for you,
bring Maggie to her house
before 8:00 so you don't miss them.
If not,
call Mel and let her know
that you don't need her
to take Maggie.
Jack, okay?
I'm gonna miss my plane.
I don't think this
is a very good idea.
Maybe I should just
cancel my honeymoon.
Don't cancel your honeymoon.
Give me these.
- You sure?
- Yep.
Okay. Those are
the telephone numbers.
- Say hi to Greg.
- Bye, baby!
Bye!
Bye, baby.
Bye, baby!
Baby!
Come on, Mom.
Okay.
Press 2, honey.
What...
Wonder where they are.
Some more?
We got s'mores,
but we're gonna need some more.
We're having
a Manhattan camp-out.
Why don't you just
bang on the door?
We can't bang on the door
of honeymooners.
What time's your school start?
I don't know.
Probably starts around 9:00.
Everything starts around 9:00.
We're gonna get there
a few minutes early
just to be safe.
What street's your school on?
I don't know.
We're in trouble.
I'm gonna miss
the boat trip, aren't I?
They're never
gonna leave on time.
We'll make it. I promise.
Let's run just in case.
What's it say?
"The whole school is on the Circle Line.
Sorry we missed you."
That's a big "uh-oh," right?
Mom!
You must be
Kristen's ex-husband.
Hi, Sammy.
Hi, Maggie.
You must be...
Okay, well, you're not Sheila,
the actress/baby-sitter.
You're not Maggie's pediatrician,
Dr. Feldman.
Hey, here you go.
"Don't forget to call
Melanie Parker."
It's underlined 3 times.
We're not quite together
this morning. I'm sorry.
What do you mean,
I must be Kristen's ex-husband?
Well, that's
Kristen's daughter,
and this is a totally
ex-husband thing to do.
Well, you would know,
because that's a totally ex-wife remark.
You know, I have a day.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Get those fish.
- Let's go. Come on.
- Dad!
Hold it! Got it!
Come on! Wait! Wait!
Hey, you forgot your fish!
Pier 56, please,
as fast as you can.
- I want to sit...
- I want to sit...
- ...next to you, Mommy.
- ...next to you, Daddy.
Okay. Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Over the top.
Could you please just take those?
Thank you.
I don't know where
you get off having an attitude,
since it's your fault
that both our kids
will probably miss
their field trip.
Attitude.
I'd rather you not
take Central Park West.
I think Broadway will be faster.
My attitude is derived
from your attitude.
"Derived."
You must be a writer.
Let me guess.
Your ex-husband is a writer.
No. My ex-husband
is a musician.
I don't need to see that.
I already have an opinion of you.
And I of you.
Liza.
Liza, thank God you're home.
- I need to ask you a huge favor.
- Melanie, is that you?
You sound awful. Where are you?
Don't answer.
I can't talk right now.
I'm on the other line
organizing Kyle's fund-rai... Bye, honey.
No, no, wait. Don't hang up.
I really need you...
Bye, honey.
Hello?
- Hello?
- Yeah, I'm here.
What's the matter?
Well, there's this guy,
who obviously thinks
that a minor amount of charm
replaces integrity and commitment,
has not only ruined my day
but Sammy's as well.
He's completely
missed his field trip.
My mom hates your dad.
So? My dad hates your mom.
- So?
- So?
Hey. It's me.
Just wanted to know
if you're wearing panties.
What color are they?
Lew, I need
this photo approved now!
If I ever act interested
in another man again,
would you please shoot me?
No, don't take 57th across!
Pink?
When is Jack getting in?
No, I will not leave Sammy
at the 9th Street
Drop-in Center, Liza.
Why?
Because he hates it there.
You're my sister.
How can you
not watch him for me?
Look, I have to meet
my boss in 15 minutes.
Then I have this
presentation which,
which could add up
to a huge promotion for me.
And you have no job, a nanny,
a cook, and a housekeeper.
The nanny is leaving to take Courtney
to Mommy and Me.
Angela is cooking all day
for our dinner party tonight.
Berta is cleaning for
our dinner party tonight.
And I am working in
the school office this morning.
Okay, what about later?
Later I'm getting dressed
for our dinner party tonight.
Mel, why don't you get a nanny?
Because I can't afford
a nanny, Liza.
You're with a girl, aren't you?
You dog, you.
A real superwoman.
Can't open her door,
won't shut her mouth.
Excuse me.
Are you talking about me?
The first lady.
We're thinking about
doing a piece on her.
No. You're insulted
because I said
that I had a presentation
and that you don't work.
I do work, Melanie.
I'm the C.E.O.
of this household.
I'm sorry
if I can't help you out today,
but you're perfect.
You'll figure it out.
Okay. Okay. Bye.
I'm tellin' you,
who do you think...
Right, right, right.
Okay. Okay, okay, okay!
Stay with me. Stay with me.
There are cars.
Thank God! It's still here!
Come on.
Beautiful! Come on!
- This is it.
- That's not it.
How do you know?
There's nobody in there!
- Maybe they're upstairs.
- Oh, they're upstairs.
Sammy, wait for me.
- Here. I got it.
- No, no. I'm fine.
Okay! Excuse me!
All right, here we go!
Take a left!
Go! Go! Push!
It was the first boat.
I'm telling you,
it was the first boat.
First boat?
There wasn't anybody on the first boat!
No!
It's all right.
We can still make it.
God damn it!
Hey!
Hey, boat!
Hey!
Hey! Come in here! Come back!
I got kids over here!
Come back!
Hey!
I got kids here!
Yeah.
Yeah!
God damn it!
Who wants to go
on a boat in the rain, anyway?
I know.
You did.
All right. Listen.
Melanie.
I feel awful about this,
and we'll make it up to you.
You, too, kiddo.
All right?
Okay.
Okay, here's an idea.
What say I watch
the kids right now
while you do your presentation?
I overheard you said
you had one in 15 minutes.
And then you watch them
for me later on today
while I do the column.
It'll only take, you know,
an hour or so.
Hi.
Maggie Taylor calling.
I have an urgent message
for stupid Sammy Parker.
I'm not stupid.
- What do you say?
- You're stupid.
I don't think so.
I only let incredibly
responsible people
- watch my son.
- I'm incredibly responsible.
I'm hungry, Daddy.
Want a Tic-Tac?
That's all I got.
Here, baby.
What's that?
Muffin. Thank you, Melanie.
You're welcome, sweetheart.
You were saying?
Well... I was saying
that maybe we could
just help each other,
help each other out today.
Well...
Hey.
Looks like you missed the boat.
I guess we did.
I really don't need your help,
but if I did, you would be
the very last person
I would turn to.
These are the class fish.
They were supposed to be
back in the classroom
at 8:30 this morning.
Now they are spending
the day with you.
God. I am going to be so late.
I have such a day. A bus!
Mom...
Those aren't toys.
Mom. It's just a phone. Mom!
Don't be like that
when you grow up.
She... She...
She just drops off,
a bag of cookies and tells me
to keep them for a week.
And how do you feel
about the cookies, Jack?
Love the cookies.
I have a big problem
with the...
Cookie maker?
That's right.
Because the cookie maker
thinks that all I am interested in
or all that I am
capable of handling,
with respect to
the cookie question,
is the...
- The frosting?
- The...
Exactly.
Now, just because the frosting
is my specialty
doesn't mean
that I can't do more.
I have many layers to me,
and they're not
all vanilla, either.
I have chocolate in me.
I have a deep,
dark chocolate...
I'm still hungry, Daddy.
Don't... I'm so...
Doc Martin and I are finishing.
But what about the cookies?
Just a little while. Okay?
It's just... I... I am...
I'm sick of angry, resentful...
Fish
who think that you
that, that, that you owe them,
but who won't trust you
for a second
to do anything for them.
There are other fish
in the sea, Jack.
Yes. I know. It's just I...
I wish I could find a fish
who wasn't afraid of
my dark chocolate layer.
And, well, she'd have
to love my cookie, too.
You know, I think, I think
that my ex cookie maker
has turned me off
to fish entirely.
I met a real piece
of work this morning.
Tell me about her, Jack.
This fish was a fox.
She had her own cookie, too.
But what a female dog.
She shoved her fish in my face.
In front of the cookie?
What's she doing with
another fish, anyway?
Is she AC/DC?
What're you talking about?
Fish with other fish
in front of cookies.
Fish.
Fish fish.
I see.
Taxi!
Taxi!
- After you. I insist.
- No, after you.
I insist more.
You can't make any noise
in the office.
I have a really
important meeting. Okay?
Don't touch that.
It's empty.
Sammy, I'm really late,
and I don't need you
spilling anything right now.
Please don't do that now.
Why not?
Because I want you
to practice being super-quiet.
Okay, now, you stay next to me.
Got your dino?
Don't you start any noises, okay?
Sammy.
You're kidding.
Just 5 minutes.
Please don't give me
a hard time now, Evelyn.
I'm 20 minutes late.
25 minutes late. Mr. Leland,
as you might expect,
is displeased.
What are those?
The Haskell blueprints.
Rob Wilding got them in
3 weeks ahead of schedule.
He did?
Why would you bring
a child here?
Remember when Sally Hanson
brought her kid here
with the poison sumac?
Mr. Leland just smelled
the calamine lotion
and had to take
the rest of the day off.
He does not have
poison anything, Evelyn.
He's not even sick.
He just missed
his field trip is all.
I don't think so.
5 minutes. Please?
And I would be doing this because?
Of our sense of solidarity?
You know, we're both women,
and this is a tough office
- and a tough world...
- 5 minutes.
- Thank you.
- Evelyn.
Has Ms. Parker come in yet?
Ms. Parker, you're late.
Yes. I'm late. I know.
I'm sorry, sir.
You're late.
Let me go get the model.
I'll be right in.
Sammy!
Oh, my God.
What made me do that?
Oh, my God.
Evelyn,
would you ask Miss Parker
to come in here, please?
No!
She'll be right in.
Put this in the back room
for me, please.
- Would you...
- Go, go.
Go, go, go, go, go.
You, get behind the desk
and stay there.
I'm sorry, sir, I forgot.
The model is still in
the model shop downtown.
I'm, I'm heading there
right now to...
You see, I went by there
earlier this morning
to pick it up for this meeting,
but the shop was locked, so...
But I promise you,
Mr. Leland, sir.
And today, at 2:00,
the people from
Yates & Yates Construction
are going to love it, too.
- I assume you're ready.
- Of course.
There's something I'd like
to show you. Evelyn,
would you bring in
the Haskell blueprint...
What an adorable little boy!
Also, would you check
if my amoxicillin prescription
still has refills available?
- Mommy...
- You know what?
That's a good idea.
Let's go find your mom.
I'm very sorry, sir,
but someone spilled my coffee
all over the Haskell blueprints.
Oh, my God.
Do you know that
every Thanksgiving
I catch strep throat?
Children who are
perfectly healthy
can give you strep throat
from other kids they know
without your even
going near them.
My sister sets up
a kids' table in the next room,
and I still get strep throat.
We're going to go find
his mother, sir.
She must work in
those new law offices
across the hall.
I'm sure she does.
Excuse me.
- Hello?
- You asshole!
- What?
- You'd better get right over here.
The mayor's called
a press conference,
5:00, city hall.
While you were talking
about pink panties,
your story was turning to shit!
You know, Miss Parker...
I don't need to remind you
what the Yates account
would be worth to this firm.
And by extension, to you.
Yeah, no, sir.
You know what I think of
when I look at him?
No.
Carrier monkey.
He's not a carrier monkey, sir.
He looks like
a healthy little...
I'll go find his mother.
Oh, my God.
What am I going to do?
I'm really sorry, Mom.
That's okay, sweetie.
It's really not your fault.
It's Maggie's daddy's fault.
This isn't a very good
breakfast, Daddy.
That's one of the advantages
of being an adult.
You get to act like a kid
any time you feel like it.
Mommy would never let me have
hamburgers and milk shakes
for breakfast.
See what I mean?
- Hello?
- Who's that?
- Who's this?
- Who's this?
- Who's this?
- Who is this?
What are you doing
with my daughter's phone?
Well...
Damn it. We must have switched.
I'm Jack Taylor.
Our kids are
in school together.
You're that Jack, Jack Taylor?
That's me.
Oh, my God! You're so adorable.
I love your column.
Well, thanks.
- You married?
- No. I'm divorced.
What's your name?
- Rita.
- Rita.
Listen, Jack,
I've got to go get exfoliated.
Now, Melanie has
your phone, right?
That's right.
So, what is that number?
Pennsylvania 3317.
Pennsylvania. So cute. 3317.
Yes. My dad used to always...
All right, darling, listen.
If you speak with her
before I do,
would you do me a favor?
Her sister telephoned me
to see if I would
baby-sit Sammy later on,
but I'm in the middle
of my spring spa day at Elizabeth Arden.
I can't possibly cancel now.
But tell her that otherwise,
I would have been
happy to baby-sit,
because no matter
what she thinks,
I have forgotten all about
Sammy putting my wedding ring
up his nose.
I'll tell her, Rita.
You're adorable.
- All right. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Hello?
- It's Jack Taylor.
How did you get this number?
That's my phone you're holding.
This is so typical of you.
Let's bypass the hostilities
- and just do messages.
- Fine.
Your mother's in the middle
of spring spa day
and can't baby-sit,
but it's not because
she's upset about Sammy
sticking her ring up her nose.
His nose. Thank you.
You have a press conference at 5:00.
Good-bye.
Think maybe we ought to arrange
to switch our phones back?
Tomorrow morning
when we drop the kids off at school.
On time?
- Fine.
- Fine.
Maggie, when you grow up
and you are incredibly beautiful
and intelligent and
possess a certain sweetness
that's like a distant promise
to the brave and to the worthy,
can you please not beat to a pulp
every miserable bastard
who comes your way
just because you can?
Can you just not do that?
Okay, Daddy.
All right.
Let me help you.
I can get it.
- No, please!
- Really! I got it.
Okay, sweetie, come on.
Stupid American woman.
That guy called you stupid.
Well, I am stupid sometimes, honey,
but I'd rather be stupid
than sorry. Come on.
How bad is it?
Well, it's modular...
so it's conceivable.
I could lift out
the damaged portion
and replace it
with the same piece
from the model.
That way, I wouldn't have
to start from scratch.
Vincent, that's brilliant.
Sammy!
Sammy, you cannot
run around, okay?
It won't be perfect.
I'm thirsty, Mommy.
It's okay.
I know you, Mel.
You won't be happy
with less than perfect.
Today I will.
I can't get
the straw part, Mommy.
I don't want to think about
what'll happen to my life
if I don't have
that model by 2:00.
All right, then.
I'll give it a try.
Thanks.
Now, while I'm doing my column,
you need to think of
about 600 fun things to do,
'cause the rest
of the day is yours.
I already know, Daddy.
I wanna go to the zoo,
and I wanna go for a carriage ride
and to the carousel
and to the Natural Museum of History,
and visit The Cats...
No, it's Cats. Not The Cats.
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey.
- Mine, oh mine
- Yeah yeah
Hi, Jack.
I never knew
you had a daughter.
Yeah. This is Maggie.
She's so cute.
She looks just like you.
She'll grow out of it.
Why are all the girls
talking to you like that?
What are you talking about?
Like what?
I won't tell you why.
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey. Celia.
Did you see what she just did?
I'm doing a story
on men like you.
What's the hook?
Just a little expression
my mother used to use,
"Love your guy like a little boy"
"and he'll grow into a man."
Jack! Get in here!

Fish.
You're not going to believe
the morning that I have had already.
What's wrong? You look cranky.
You back on that diet again?
Honey, you remember Lew.
We haven't seen each
other for a long time.
I am cranky, Jack.
And I ate a very good breakfast
this morning.
We're in big trouble
on your garbage story.
Oh, God.
Come here, honey.
I want to show you something.
It's okay. Go ahead.
Now, this is Lois Lane.
She lives here in the newsroom.
Want to pet her, sweetheart?
Go ahead.
She won't bite.
You got this raging scoop disease,
my friend.
Which is what
you love about me.
Why don't you stay here
and play with the kitty?
Me and your daddy gonna
have a little talk, okay?
- Yeah.
- That's a girl.
Let's go.
Would you rather
that I wasn't first?
I'd rather you were right.
I am right.
Okay.
Who told you
that the mayor's re-election campaign
were taking illegal contributions
from the mob?
Manny Feldstein.
Manny Feldstein told you,
on the record,
that the Newark-based trucking company
of Grace & Marr,
a well-known mob front,
has made an illegal contribution
to Mayor Aikens re-election campaign.
That's right. On the record.
In exchange for receiving
the city's sanitation contract.
On the record.
Which were awarded without bidding.
- Through Grace & Marr.
- Right. On the record.
Manny Feldstein's going to say
he never talked to you!
What? What? Hey.
During the mayor's
press conference today,
Manny Feldstein's going to say
you made the whole thing up.
You didn't make it up,
did you, Jack?
Of course not, Lew.
Manny told me
that he saw the campaign accounts.
There was $250,000...
Where's Metro?
Deposited in unnumbered accounts.
- Freddy, here.
- Unnumbered.
We may have to print
a retraction.
- Of what?
- Get back in there.
You're going to give me an ulcer.
I can feel it.
It's like I swallowed
a car battery.
Why couldn't you get 2 sources?
Remember the Cardinal O'Brien story?
Know how close we came
to getting fired on that?
I almost got the Pulitzer prize.
It's real simple, Jack.
Management doesn't want
to clean up after you...
Not now!
I'm a good reporter, Lew.
No.
You are a great reporter,
but sometimes you
just get too excited,
and then you get me
too excited.
And now I've given you
enough rope to hang us both.
And, Jack, nobody almost
gets a Pulitzer prize.
- Jack...
- One second.
They're not going to fire me.
My pictures are on buses.
That's what I said.
Then they asked me
to have lunch with Frank Burroughs.
Dad...
Frank Burroughs?
"Frankly Speaking" is
a very popular column.
Hey, Dad?
Frank Burroughs is a pompous, arrogant,
humorless asshole.
Who's won the Pulitzer prize.
You know something, Lew?
I'm not going to lose
my job, all right?
I got alimony and shrink bills,
- I got college loans to repay...
- Daddy...
One second.
I have a plumbing situation.
Now, Manny has been my guy
all year long...
One second, darling.
I played bridge
with his mother.
I took his niece
to Cirque de Soleil...
Just one second.
I had to sit through
him playing Tevye
in dinner theater,
Lew. Dinner theater!
Jack, I gave you this column,
and I love you like a son,
but I can't cover for you anymore.
Now, you've got
less than 6 hours
to that press conference
and no other leads.
We've gotta get Feldstein
back on the record
or find another reliable source
to confirm this whole goddamn thing.
Otherwise, we're printing a retraction.
And I guarantee you, Jack,
it'll be your last.
Fine. If you need me,
I'm at a different
number today.
Now where you going?
To find Manny.
Take care of yourself, kid.
Oh, I will.
- Hi. Jack?
- Yeah?
Listen...
I really wanted
to say something.
Go ahead.
I've noticed that
you haven't dated
for quite a while.
Right.
Actually, we've all noticed.
Hey, there we go.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I know
that you're sensitive,
but frightened.
I'm gentle,
but brutal.
Think about it.
Think about me, Jack.
I will.
Okay.
Yeah.
Brutal.
Marla?
Marla, have you seen my daughter?
Have you seen Maggie?
No. No, I haven't.
No? Excuse me, please.
Have you seen my daughter?
No?
Maggie?
Damn it!
Hey, Jack...
Hi, Daddy.
"Hi, Daddy?"
Do you do this
with your mother,
this wandering-off thing?
- Yeah.
- 'Cause it's not a good thing to do.
Listen, I gotta go talk
to a guy downtown.
It's kind of tricky,
and I only have one shot at it,
which means...
- That I can't come?
- Right.
Now, what am I going
to do with you?
Look, this is incredibly
difficult for me,
but you're the last person
I could think of to ask.
I'm really in a bind.
I could lose my job.
I know you're recording, but...
Can you hold on a minute?
I know you're recording,
but it would just be for an hour.
From 2:00 to 3:00.
Come on, Eddie,
you're his father.
Fine. Never mind.
I'll think of something.
Are you at least
coming to his soccer game?
6:00.
It would mean a lot to him.
- Mel!
- Sammy!
Sammy, get off of that!
Get off of it. Time out!
Get...
What is the matter with you?
You almost broke it again.
Why can't you just play quietly
and not get into trouble
for 5 minutes?
Don't you realize
how important this is?
That's it.
I'm taking you to the 9th Street center.
I don't wanna go there, Mommy.
Too bad.
- Those kids will beat me...
- They won't.
Yes, they will...
You'll have to be
really brave, then.
Vincent, I'll be back in an hour
to pick up the model!
Now, when the little hand gets
between the 4 and the 5,
- that's 4:30.
- I'm sorry.
You're not being punished.
I'll be back,
and then we can go
to your soccer game.
But that's too long.
I set the alarm
and you'll wear it,
and I'll be here
by the time it goes off.
I promise.
Come on.
But I don't wanna go
in there, Mom.
But it'll be fun.
Look! It's superhero day!
Hey! Spider-Man!
He can't come in here.
He's not a superhero!
Oh, yeah?
You guys sure about that?
He doesn't look like one.
He looks like a poo-poo crybaby.
When the big hand gets to...
There...
And the little hand gets to...
There...
Then...
You'll be back.
Wait a minute...
Easy, isn't it?
Hang on.
Now you're wearing
Daddy's watch.
But I don't have a costume.
Costume?
Okay. How about...
Bessie the choreographer?
5, 6, 7, 8... Moo!
Moo!
You know, I don't... I got...
I don't have a costume.
Hey.
Hey, Maggie! Look!
Honey... Maggie!
Hi, Sammy.
Hi, Maggie.
I thought you told your sister
that you weren't going to bring him here.
Well, I got desperate.
Me, too.
So...
Looks like we need
2 superheroes and fast.
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this,
Mama said
Mama said, Mama said
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this,
my mama said
Mama said, Mama said
I went walking the other day, yeah
Everything was going fine
I met a little boy named Billy Joe
And then I almost lost my mind
Where'd you get
a bag like that?
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this,
my mama said
If those mean boys
give you any more trouble,
first go to the teacher.
If she doesn't help,
call me on the mobile.
If you can't reach me,
call 911.
Just kick
the mean boys in the shins.
My eyes were wide open
- Bye!
- Bye!
Thanks for doing that.
Sure.
It's hard enough being a kid.
It is excellent.
And you would know.
- What about?
- Nothing.
Know what my mother
used to say to me?
No.
"Love your guy like a little boy,"
"and he'll grow into a man."
"Love your guy like a little boy,
he'll grow into a man."
She knew back then
that you were gay?
- I'm not gay.
- Then why did she advise you
on how guys wanna be loved?
Taxi!
Maybe she was hoping
I'd meet a woman like that someday.
I can't stand people
who blame their worst traits
on everyone but themselves.
It's so nineties.
Man, what are you
talking about?
You're blaming your Peter Pan complex
on your mother.
- What Peter Pan complex?
- The one you're so proud of.
- You got any friends?
- I don't have time.
That's because of
your Captain Hook complex.
My what?
- Captain Hook complex.
- There's no such thing.
Yes, there is, and you have it.
Here's your phone back.
Here's yours.
Thank you!
Man.
Manny! Hey.
Feldstein. Hey.
I can't be with you
right now, Jack.
Manny.
Excuse me.
Manny!
Hey, Manny.

Manny!
- Hey, Manny.
- Please, just don't hit me.
I'm not going to hit you.
Now, what's going on?
I've been having thoughts.
We already had our thoughts.
Please don't yell at me.
You were the one who said to me
this garbage thing stinks.
Now, I've waited for a month
for you to get comfortable
with this.
You get comfortable,
we print the story,
it runs on the front page,
and now you are telling me
that you are having thoughts.
What is the matter with you?
I've been having trouble
with my medication.
You get the dosage wrong,
you get a little grandiose.
We were talking about
taking down the mayor and
the mob together, right?
Yes, that's right. That's crazy.
No, it's not.
It is.
Now that I'm better regulated,
I realize they definitely
will kill me!
Manny, come here.
Listen, Manny...
Don't do this to me, all right?
Look at me.
Hey.
I'm the one who started
your standing ovation
for If I Were a Rich Man, right?
- I can't do it.
- You can do it.
You're my guy.
I got a wife and a family.
I'm their guy, too.
You're hurting my neck.
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
All right.
I'm sorry, Jack.
Well, give me the...
Give me a name.
I can't think of any names.
Think.
Whose name is on the account?
I don't know.
I only saw numbers.
Okay. Who set up the account?
- I don't...
- Give me a name.
Who set up the account?
I don't know.
Eddie McCoy maybe?
Maybe Eddie McCoy.
Eddie, how...
You know what?
I'm gonna figure it out myself.
Okay, Manny? Thanks.
Thank you.
Hello?
Mommy...
What happened?
I don't wanna
stay here anymore,
and neither does Maggie.
Sweetie, you're gonna
have to stay there.
- Just for a little while...
- No!
What happened?
Spider-Man kicked me
and Sheryl took Maggie's snack.
Let me talk to the teacher.
He's outside talking to the Hulk
about not using the "F" word.
Sammy, you have
to be tough and brave...
What's L.S.D.?
L.S.D.?
Spider-Man was talking to Maggie
about L.S.D. that
he got from his brother.
Stay right where you are.
You will both be picked up
in 10 minutes.
No. Manny's a dead end.
Did he give you anything?
Eddie McCoy.
Probably set up the account.
He's the campaign manager.
He wouldn't implicate himself.
City comptroller.
He'll never talk.
The sanitation commissioner?
Lieberman?
Metro!
How do we get a hold
of Lieberman?
Lieberman's in Barbados.
The sanitation commissioner
is in Barbados?
In the middle
of a garbage scandal.
Maybe the mayor
wanted him out of town.
Metro!
What?
What's Lieberman
doing in Barbados?
He's there with
his new girlfriend.
Which leaves his very angry wife.
Bingo!
I'm in the lobby.
I'll be right up.
Here we go.
Yeah?
Jack, it's Melanie Parker.
We have a major problem
with our kids.
They're okay,
but they can't stay there.
- They have to be picked up right now.
- Okay.
- Can you do it?
- Me? Now?
I would definitely jeopardize
my career and by extension
my entire life
if I picked them up now.
Well, I would definitely
jeopardize my career
and by extension
my entire life
if I picked them up now.
But your press conference
isn't until 5:00, right?
My presentation is at 2:00.
I've got to see this lady
Elaine Lieberman
about some information I need.
Couldn't you do that
on the phone?
- Yeah. I...
- Great.
Is there anybody else
you could call?
I wouldn't be asking you
if there were anyone else I could call.
Yeah.
Look, how about
if I watch them both
from, say, 3:00 until
your press conference ends
if you'll watch them both
from now until 3:00?
You're asking me for help?
It would appear that way,
wouldn't it?
I'll agree if you say,
"Jack, please be my knight
in shining armor."
Jack, don't be a shithead.
Go rescue our kids.
This is hard for you, isn't it?
Are you agreeing or not?
You know, you're not
the only one with a day.
I've got a day, too.
Sorry.
I'll meet you and the kids
in my office lobby at
Rockefeller Center at 3:15.
Fine.
Marla, tell Celia
to get Elaine Lieberman's
home number
and call me on my cell phone.
No...
What?
I forgot to tell you
that Sammy is allergic
to shellfish and dander,
and, also, he's not allowed
to watch commercial TV,
and no matter what he says,
he has to hold your hand
when he crosses the street.
Oh, and, also,
if you go to the playground,
I like to check the sandbox first.
You never know
what people throw in there.
And also...
Okay. Bye.
Fine.
One fine day
You'll look at me
And then you'll know our love was
Meant to be
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl
The arms I long for
Will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me
Right by your side
- Hello.
- Hi. It's me.
Me who?
- You have the kids?
- What kids?
You didn't pick up the kids?
Hi!
You mean those kids.
Look, I was just calling...
You just wanted to call
and check up on me
because you don't really trust me.
Sammy! Sammy, no.
Put the gun down.
And you only asked me
to watch Sammy
out of sheer desperation.
Part of you would feel safer
with him at the 9th Street
Drop-in Center with L.S.D.
Isn't that true?
No, that is not true.
I only wanted to warn you
that Sammy can get into trouble
faster than you can
make most women smile.
Are you flirting with me?
Would you please
just really pay attention to him?
I won't let him
out of my sight.
Sammy! Hey, guns aren't toys.
It's not loaded.
Good-bye.
Sammy, how long have your
mom and dad been divorced?
I don't know.
It doesn't matter, really,
'cause she said
she'll always love him.
- Yeah? Hey, what's that?
- Marble.
That's a marble.
That's what that is.
You get to see your dad a lot?
Come here.
Pretty much, usually.
He has a different schedule
than a lot of other dads.
He's a drummer.
His favorite thing to do
is watch me play soccer.
He's probably coming today,
and he's taking me fishing
this whole summer,
just us,
and maybe Mom will come, too.
- Your dad's a drummer?
- Yep.
- Sounds like a great guy, Sammy.
- He is.
Kurt, Jake,
you remember Melanie Parker.
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.
Nice to see you.
Well,
voila.
I love this.
- This is... What is that?
- A vaulted...
A vaulted pediment.
Vaulted pediment.
- I love that.
- Yeah?
But I need to see this with cars.
You don't need cars, Dad.
Just use your imagination.
My imagination?
I have to see it with the cars.
Cars.
See?
She's quite a little discovery.
Yes, she is.
Why don't you join us
for drinks this evening?
Let's say 5:30 at the 21.
I... I don't know if I can.
We'll talk about this project.
From what I've seen,
you could bring
a great deal to this.
I'll be there.
Terrific.
That's great.
Hi. This is Jack Taylor
of the Daily News.
- I'm looking for Elaine Lieberman...
- Quit trying to be like my dad.
- Am not.
- Am, too. Daddy?
Yeah?
Who's that man on the bus?
- What? Who's what?
- Who's that man?
It says, "Frankly Speaking."
Very important.
Elaine Lieberman.
Here we go.
Hold hands. Hold hands.
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa,
could you just try
to speak English?
Okay.
- Hello?
- Hello?
Right. Okay, all right...
I need to...

Pronto.
Yeah. Wait, wait, wait.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Okay. Bye-bye.
No. No, no, no.

Listen to me. Listen.
I need to find Mrs. Lieberman.
- Okay.
- Okay.
If I don't find her,
I could lose my job.
If you don't understand,
say, "Okay."
Okay.
Okay. Bye-bye. Gracias.
Bye-bye.
Give me the marble.
It's my dad's.
Give it!
It's my dad's marble.
No, Rosa?
No, Rosa, it's...
No, no, no, no. Don't hang up.
- Do you speak Spanish by any chance?
- What do you need?
OK. Great.
Her name is Rosa Lopez.
Her boss is Elaine Lieberman.
I need to know where she is.
I'm Jack Taylor.
I'm a reporter for the Daily News.
Elaine is her boss.
No, no, no, no.
Tell her Elaine wants to speak to me
very badly, too. Very badly.
Jack Taylor.
Jack Taylor...
So?
So?
So give me it!
- So?
- So, give it.
- No.
- Yes!
Guys, hey, guys. Guys!
What are you doing?
Give me it.
- Guys, what are you doing?
- Mr. Taylor.
- Take turns.
- Mr. Taylor!
Senora Lopez says
that Mrs. Lieberman
is at the Elizabeth Arden salon
for her spring spa day.
Spring spa day?
Elizabeth Arden? Excellent.
Dad!
What? You guys are being a...
Oh, man.
- You're so stupid.
- Am not.
Are so.
You ruined my dad's marble.
He's not gonna want it
with your snot all over it.
Yes, I will.
I'll just wash it off.
You're gonna be fine.
The doctor's just gonna
pop that thing
right out of there.
How come you couldn't do it?
Well, you know,
that's a little nose,
big marble.
But, see, the doctor,
he's gonna have this clamp thing
that's gonna come up and
just yank it right out,
and you are gonna be fine.
You've just gotta
not worry about it,
and you've gotta
not think about it.
You've gotta think
about something else.
You've gotta think about...
Hello, Sammy.
Hello?
Hi, sexy, I miss you.
Look, whoever you are,
this isn't Jack's phone anymore.
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
No. Who are you?
This is Celia.
I'm a friend of Jack's,
and who's this?
Absolutely nobody.
Whatever.
Could you please tell him
that Kristen just
called from the Bahamas
to let him know her number there?
And this is very important.
Elaine Lieberman will only be
at Elizabeth Arden's until 3:30.
So if you could
pass on those messages,
we'd both appreciate it.
Your mom is gonna kill me
if I don't have you guys
in the lobby
by 3:15 on the dot.
I don't think she'll kill ya.
She's not like that, really.
She isn't?
No. She just acts tough and mean
'cause she'd rather
be safe than sorry.
What does that mean?
She just says it a lot
when men try to open
her door and stuff.
Yeah?
Excuse us!
Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.
- Hi.
- Hi, you guys!
Hey, hey.
Your friend Celia called
to tell you... Sammy!
It's okay, only an escalator.
That Kristen called you
from the Bahamas
and also that Elaine Lew...
Lieberman.
Will be at Elizabeth Arden's
until 3:30.
Great.
Thank you so much for
watching Sammy, really.
You saved my life.
Was he any trouble?
No. Not at all.
Good.
So, everything worked out great.
I was sure you were
going to either
show up 3 hours late
or not at all.
Guess what?
I'm not like every other man you know.
No. I realize that.
I was just kidding.
No, you weren't, but...
Guess what? I'm not like
every other woman you know.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You probably think
I'm a real control freak,
and I'm not at all.
Well, I mean, I do like things
the way I like them,
but who doesn't?
And, anyway, in my life,
I'm the only one who ever
does anything, so,
what does it matter?
Maybe you should let somebody
help you out
every once in a while.
Definitely not.
I've got all of these little balls
up in the air,
and if somebody else
caught one from me,
I'd drop them all.
But you're not a control freak.
No. I'm a single working mother.
Okay. I have more work to do
than time to do it.
So before you and I
get into yet another
lengthy and exhausting thing,
I have a career to save, okay?
Do you have any instructions
for me before you...
No, no. I trust you completely.
I don't suppose you could...
you could switch your thing
from 5:00 to, say, 4:30?
Because I just found out
that I have a new thing at 5:30.
Can't switch my thing.
I'll switch mine. No problem.
See you guys
at the soccer game?
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye, Jack!
Thanks again, Jack.
You're welcome.
I realize it's difficult,
what with...
Celia, Kristen, Elaine.
I know your name, Mel.
So what did you guys
do with Jack?
Quit kicking me, Maggie.
I wasn't going to say
anything about.
About what?
Nothing.
It's a secret.
We're not supposed to say.
Secret about what?
About your dad?
And you, too, Mommy.
Me, too?
Come on, you guys.
Tell.
Secret about me and Jack.
Does it have anything
to do with feelings?
What do you mean?
You know, feelings,
like being scared
or hurt or happy and excited.
You know,
those are all feelings.
Definitely about feelings, then.
Yeah. Definitely.

Switch.
Sorry, Mom.
That's okay, honey.
So, what'd you get?
Frozen hot chocolate.
Yum.
You like chocolate?
I love chocolate.
Daddy told Dr. Martin this morning
that he's got deep dark chocolate
inside of him.
Really?
And that
he'd like to meet a fish
who wasn't afraid
of his dark chocolate layer.
I think I'm beginning
to guess the secret.
Are you mad?
Not really.
I think he should have
talked about it with me, though.
He was afraid you'd hate him.
Of course I wouldn't hate him.
Honestly, that is so silly.
You don't understand.
This is an emergency.
I don't interrupt Mrs. Lieberman
during her bikini wax.
Now, listen...
Don't bother with the cute face.
I have five sons.
You make eyes at me like that,
I make you pot roast.
Oh, excuse me.
Hello, Mrs. Keffner.
Let me get your robe.
Good-bye, Mrs. Lieberman.
- Next week.
- Yes, indeed.
Down, please.
Hey, is Mrs. Lieberman here?
No? Okay.
- Hi.
- Hey, hi.
Hi, hi, hi.
Hey, is Mrs. Lieberman,
Elaine Lieberman in here
by any chance?
Hey, it's okay. I'm sorry.
Hi. I'm looking
for Elaine Lieberman.
- She just left.
- Thank you.
- Jack!
- Yep?
- Is that you?
- Yeah.
- It's Rita!
- Who?
Melanie's mother.
Oh, Rita. Hey!
Do you... Sorry.
Do you believe
what a small world?
I know.
I just spent the whole afternoon
with your grandson.
Yeah.
He's cute, but he's a handful.
I'm just trying to catch up
with Elaine Lieberman.
I just want to tell you one thing
about my daughter,
and it's something
that you may suspect.
She can make you want to scream
like you're having a body wax.
I mean, she's that frustrating.
Yeah.
Inside, Jack, she's mush.
Mush.
So you scream all you want,
but just don't
run away too soon.
Okay. All right.
Okay, bye-bye.
You're adorable.
Mrs. Lieberman? Where is she?
Yeah? Okay. Mrs. Lieberman!
Mrs. Lieberman! Mrs. Lieberman.
Jack Taylor, Daily News!
Get in.
Oh, all right!
Listen, hey, hey.
I'm glad I finally found you.
I have to ask you kind
of a difficult question.
About my husband?
I don't know how much you know
about his business affairs.
Are you referring
to the illegal account?
So you know about that?
- It's in his name.
- Yeah.
I have the deposit slips.
I don't suppose
you'd be willing to go...
- Go on the record?
- I know it's a lot to ask.
Elaine Lieberman. E-l-a-i-n-e
L-I-e-b-e-r-m-a-n.
I only have one request.
Anything at all.
Fax him a copy in Barbados.
All right.
Hello?
Hi, darling.
Mom, thank God.
I'm in big trouble.
I have to have drinks
with clients at 5:30,
or I'll be fired,
and I have absolutely
no childcare.
What time are you done
at Elizabeth Arden's?
Sammy! Put that down.
Honey, you're gonna break it.
You only think about work.
What about your personal life?
Actually, Mom,
today I thought a lot
about my personal life.
Don't laugh. I did.
Come here, kitty, kitty-kitty.
Kitty?
Kitty.
Kitty?
What do you mean,
don't be my usual self with him?
I don't think my usual self
could be all that bad
since I'm pretty sure
Jack just told the kids
he has feelings for me.
He wants to ask me out on a date.
Divine.
Maggie? Sammy, where's Maggie?
Take that out of your nose.
What is the matter with you?
Excuse me. I'm...
The thing is I'm...
I think I could have
feelings for him, too,
or at least I think
I might be able to,
which is, you know,
it's a big step up for me.
Mom, could you
hold on a minute?
Maggie?
Well, you know, I had no idea
from that floating head
on top of his column
that he was so tall,
and he's got that
good color in his skin,
which you also couldn't tell
from the black-and-white photo.
He really is altogether yummy, Mel.
And how would you know?
Because he was
just here, darling.
This isn't some
horrifyingly elaborate
matchmaking scheme, is it, Mom?
Maggie!
Of course not, darling.
Maggie!
Oh, my God.
I just lost his daughter!
- You lost his daughter?
- Maggie!
Maggie!
Oh, my God!
Excuse me.
Have you seen a little girl?
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Have you seen a little girl?
She's about 6 years old,
and she's wearing...
Excuse me, sir.
Have you seen a little girl?
- Sorry.
- She's about 6...
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Have you seen a little girl?
She's about 6.
Maggie!
Have you seen a little girl?
She's about 6 years old.
Excuse me.
Have you seen a little girl?
Excuse me.
Have you seen a lost little girl?
Maggie!
Well, hello.
Hi.
Is there anything else you
can tell us, Ms. Parker?
I don't think so. I just...
He's still not answering.
I just can't
believe this happened.
One minute she was there,
and then the next...
- I understand that, but...
- No, you don't understand.
I just met this guy
this morning,
and I was horrible to him all day!
- Excuse me.
- You're shivering and...
Jimmy, get her a coat!
Why did I have to be
so horrible to him?
I called him immature
and uncharming and irresponsible,
and I was my usual self.
She said... Excuse me!
But I've lost a little girl!
I'm sorry.
She said,
"Don't be your usual self,"
but I was my usual self.
And he took perfect care
of my son for me
while I did my presentation,
which went very well,
then I lost his daughter!
How could I have done that?
It probably wasn't your fault.
And I didn't even pay my bill
from Serendipity's.
Do you mind?
Is that your mom?
Mrs. Lieberman, Elaine,
you have saved my life.
Again.
That was smart.
- Jack.
- Mike.
I love you, Lew!
I love this town.
I love this job.
I love Elaine Lieberman.
That's a lot of love
for you, Jack.
I got to tell you something.
I met someone today.
What are you talking about?
I don't know how to describe her.
She's...
She's luminous.
Her face is...
You're talking about women.
Yeah.
Your ass is on the line,
and you're talking about women?
- Are you nuts?
- That is under control.
I have Elaine Lieberman
on the record,
and she has proof
of a campaign account.
Elaine Lieberman's an angry wife.
All her husband's got to do
is send her some kind of sorry-gram,
and she's off the record.
You have my word.
Your word means nothing
to management.
You better make sure
that Elaine Lieberman
gets to that press conference
this afternoon.
Either she confronts
the mayor directly
or I'm going to have
to print a retraction.
Don't worry. Elaine's my girl.
I hope so, Jack.
- Jack?
- Yeah.
I just had lunch
with Frank Burroughs.
Very bright. Very funny.
Very humble man.
You love me, Lew.
You know you do.
Come on, Lois, come on.
That's it.
Hey, Lew!
Lew, where's Jack?
On the way to city hall.
But I have a ton
of urgent messages for him.
I can't sit here like this.
I got to go find Jack.
He's going to be at city hall
in 15 minutes. Come on, honey.
5:00. That's great.
Hang on!
Yes, Elaine?
Excuse me one second.
City hall, please.
Look, I can't thank you enough.
Dwayne.
Please, city hall.
Look, I'll do my best
to get there on time, Jack.
I was just on my way
to Staten Island,
so I might be
a couple of minutes late.
All right? Dwayne, hurry up!
Hello.
Mr. Taylor?
Lieutenant Bonomo, 18th precinct.
We found your daughter.
What?
Excuse me. You haven't seen
Jack Taylor anywhere, have you?
No, I haven't.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, but you don't happen
to know Jack Taylor, do you?
Very well, in fact.
You're Celia, aren't you?
Yes, and you must be the one
who lost his little girl.
- Hello, Maggie!
- Daddy!
- Hey, hi!
- Hello.
Hi, I'm Jack Taylor.
That's mine over there.
Thank you very much
for watching her.
Well, it was my pleasure.
I'm sure it was.
We got to hurry. Come on.
No, Daddy.
I want to play with the kitties.
There's no time
to play with the kitties.
We got to go
to a press conference.
Hi, kitties. How are you?
Tag. You're it.
Come on. Chase me.
No, Daddy.
I want to play with the kitties.
Red light, green light.
Come on.
Stop it!
Come on. Let's go.
Don't do this right now.
If I don't get there...
Want me to lose my job?
No, stop it!
Do you want me to lose my job?
You really love
those kittens, right?
Yeah.
Come on. Watch your head.
There.
Okay. So what are their names?
This one is Bob,
'cause he looks like a bobcat.
And that one's Fred.
And that one's...
I forget this one's name.
Well, okay. Listen, Maggie,
I know this has been
a rotten day for you.
I know that right now
all you want to do is
play with these kittens.
I don't blame you,
'cause they're great.
But if I don't get to
this press conference,
I'm going to lose my job.
I don't want to lose my job.
So we got to work
something out.
Some kind of a deal here, so...
What if we talk to
this beautiful young lady
and we ask her
if maybe Bob can come
to the press conference with us?
You mean keep him?
Borrow him.
But I want to keep him.
You'll have to talk to
your mother about that.
She's allergic.
That's right. She gets all...
All right.
Well, you know what?
Bob can just stay at my house.
Where would he sleep?
You know that room
with all the boxes in it?
We could clear those out.
He could sleep in there.
That's a good idea.
Of course, you know,
you're going to have to come over
and visit every once in a while
just to check up and make sure
that I'm feeding him
and everything.
I will.
Yeah.
Come here.
You know, maybe
what we ought to do
is put a bed in
that room for you, too.
Yeah.
'Cause he might get lonely.
He's not going to get
lonely with you there.
Well, let me take
a look at this guy.
So this is going to be our cat?
Bob.
All right.
Now, can we get out of here already?
Yeah?
Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Burroughs.
Mr. Mayor, do you plan
to sue Jack Taylor
and the Daily News
for the apparently false
and certainly
unsubstantiated charges
they've made against you?
Say, that's not a bad idea.
Hey, Dad,
that guy's on the bus, too.
Would you hurry, please?
He has a bigger
picture than yours.
Do you speak English?
Last question, please.
Excuse me!
Excuse me.
Last question, please.
Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!
Mom, what are you doing?
You're not a reporter.
I got to do something.
- Mr. Mayor!
- Mr. Mayor?
What are you going to say?
I don't know. Mr. Mayor!
Yes.
You, on the right.
I... What about Elaine...
- Lieberman.
- Lieberman?
What about her?
She's the wife of
my sanitation commissioner.
She's got nothing to do with this.
What paper are you with,
young lady?
I... I... I believe Elaine Lieberman
has spoken to Jack Taylor
and can back up
everything he said.
Jack Taylor is a reckless man
with a gift
for manipulating the truth.
I know Jack Taylor, sir,
and... and... and he is pretty
cocky most of the time,
and he does seem to have
somewhat of a cavalier attitude,
but at least he's honest.
I don't know what relationship
you have with Mr. Taylor, miss,
but it's quite clear
you know nothing about politics
and nothing about journalism.
That's it. No more questions.
Thank you.
Mr. Mayor!
Melanie!
Look, Melanie. I got a kitty.
His name's Bob
and Dad said I can keep him.
Mr. Mayor!
Jack, Elaine Lieberman didn't show up.
I know that. Mr. Mayor!
No, no, no, Mr. Taylor.
The press conference is over!
Mr. Mayor, you may be able
to strong-arm Manny Feldstein.
That's tough to do.
And you may be able
to buffalo my paper
into printing a retraction...
They may actually fire me...
But you and I both know
this garbage thing stinks,
- don't we?
- Pitiful, Mr. Taylor.
You and your little friend
in the outfit,
just pitiful!
What is pitiful, Mr. Mayor,
is that if I had
a few minutes more,
Elaine Lieberman would be here
with a canceled check
for $250,000
from a very well-known mob front
made out to your re-election campaign.
That's a blatant fabrication,
Mr. Taylor!
We both know that no such
canceled check exists.
You know something?
You're right. I'm confused.
There would be no check,
but there would be a deposit slip,
wouldn't there, Elaine?
Come here.
Can I have that, please?
Hello, Sidney.
All right.
This is dated March 15th
of this year.
It is a deposit slip for $250,000.
That same day,
a deposit was made
into your campaign account
for $250,000,
but I guess that was
just a coincidence.
The press conference is over!
I said over!
Mrs. Lieberman,
how did you discover the account?
Elaine, what can I say?
It was my pleasure.
All right. See you later.
Jack, could I see that document?
In the paper tomorrow,
you can, Frank.
You guys want to go
to a soccer game?
- Yeah.
- All right. Come on. Let's go.
Does your husband know
that you've done this?
My husband.
Funny you bring that up.
He's in Barbados.
B-a-r-b-a-d...
That was an excellent moment
in my life.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Mommy, can we go
to the soccer game now?
- Yes, sweetheart.
- Yeah, boy. Come here.
I really am so sorry
about Maggie.
I don't even want to think
about what could've happened.
I don't want to think
about it either.
When I do think about it,
I can't believe that
I was issued shellfish
and dander warnings,
sandbox alerts.
You even laughed in my face
- when I showed up at your office on time.
- I know.
And then you lost my daughter.
I know. It was the worst thing
I could've ever done.
I really am so, so very sorry.
So someone else is
the irresponsible one,
- aren't they?
- Yes, they are.
I would like to hear you say that,
say it for your kind.
My kind?
The ones with all the balls
in the air.
That's the least you could do.
Of course I'll say it, Jack.
I was the irresponsible one.
- Great.
- Taxi!
"Now say
“I can't do everything on my own."
Why?
Because with one sentence
you'll restore my faith
in women again.
Of course I'll say it
for you, Jack.
We're never going
to get a cab, you know.
You can't say it.
Sure, I can,
just as long as you realize
that it won't be true.
I'm waiting.
Okay. I can't do
everything alone.
There. Great.
Even though my daily activities
year after year
immediately contradict
what I just said.
Oh, unbelievable!
You made me grovel for no reason.
You groveled for great reason.
You are an arrogant ball juggler, baby.
First of all,
don't call me baby.
Secondly, if you don't
want your balls juggled,
don't throw them in my face.
I threw them in your face?
Yes, you did,
starting off this morning
when you thrust
your stupid column at me
as some sort of lame excuse
for my son missing his field trip.
Balls in my face.
Big Jack reporter
can't possibly concentrate
on mundane details
like picking up the phone to say,
"Thanks anyway,
but I won't be needing you"
"to take my daughter
to school today and then..."
That's not quite how it happened.
You have to ask
who I can only assume
is one of your many girlfriends
if she's wearing her panties
as loud as you can.
Balls in my face.
And now in the midst
of my obvious remorse,
you make me grovel?
First of all... First of all,
I thrust my column in your face
because I thought
you were the most beautiful woman
that I've ever seen
in my entire life,
and I want...
I wanted to make a good impression.
Now, I forgot to
call you this morning
because I, as opposed to you,
am not used to doing
everything on my own.
So I slipped up there.
As for the panties,
that remark was to my editor Lew,
simply to piss you off.
Come on, Dad. I've got a taxi.
Can we go?
Hey. We got the cab.
I think my dad likes your mom.
Maybe my mom likes him back.
Men like you
have made me the woman I am.
All the women I know like you
have made me think
all women are like you.
Oh, my God. I almost forgot.
I've got a meeting,
drinks with clients.
5:25. You're never
going to make it.
Mom, it's the last game
of the season.
It's for the championship, Mom,
and the coach said
every kid has to play
or they don't get a trophy.
Even the losers get a trophy,
but you don't get a trophy
if you don't play.
It's on the way. We'll make it.
Let go of it.
I can't let go of it.
It's my job. Hold this.
Could we go
to the 21 Club instead?
21 West 52nd Street,
and don't try to take 14th
or 32nd or 44th across.
You can't make a left
at this hour.
I...I... I know I can do this.
No, don't take Broadway.
It's bound to be a mess.
Try 6th Avenue,
but not until after 23rd
because of the construction.
French-fried eyeballs
floating in a bowl of...
- Snot.
- Snot.
Here we go.
Why don't you hold the cab,
and if I'm not
back in 15 minutes,
just go on ahead without me.
You're going to take longer
than 15 minutes.
I can do this. Okay, baby.
Mommy, what if you don't come
and Daddy doesn't come?
Oh, sweetheart,
I'm going to be there.
You are the most
important thing to me
in the entire world.
Your job is.
No, you are,
but I have to do this now.
Sammy, I know I've
dragged you places
and left you places,
and I've been
a crazy person today,
but it's going
to be better tomorrow.
I promise I won't take
longer than 15 minutes
in there, okay? Okay?
Hey, Sammy, come here.
Don't worry about it.
She'll make it, okay?
Let's get you ready for soccer.
Grab me that bag.
Hello. How are you?
Hi. I see my party.
Oh, here she is.
I'm glad you could make it.
What's your poison?
Oh, I'll just have some water.
Nonsense.
We're way ahead of you.
You have some catching up to do.
She'll have a dry
vodka martini straight up.
Hey, what are you
thinking about, kiddo?
I hope my daddy can come
to our soccer game.
Yeah.
Mommy hopes he can come, too.
Last night...
Last night
my mom thought I was asleep,
but I really wasn't
and I heard her say
over and over again,
"Please let Eddie come."
"Please let Eddie come."
Eddie? Who's Eddie?
Eddie's my dad.
I hope he comes, too,
there, kiddo.
We were just discussing plans
for a sort of upscale
amusement complex for adults.
You know, with food
and games and rides.
No rides, Dad.
After drinks,
we wanted to take
a drive to Stanford.
We were hoping to take a look
at a kind of a bad version
of what we have in mind.
But before we head out,
Melanie, maybe you could toss out
a few ideas,
just off the top of your head.
Well,
adult amusement complexes,
up until now,
have been somewhat cheesy,
usually attached
to popular video stores.
What I'm thinking of
is something
a bit more exciting.
A drawing might help,
don't you think?
I...
I love drawings.
I don't have a...
Here you go.
Oh, okay.
Let's see.
Something like...
Isn't that the little lost boy
from this morning?
What?
With, you know...
You know, I can't do this now.
And I can't go with you
to Stanford now either.
Yes, Mr. Leland,
that is the little lost boy
from this morning,
only he's not lost.
He's my son.
I have a child
and he has a soccer game
in 20 minutes.
If he's late,
he doesn't get the trophy.
And because I'm in here with you,
he's probably going to be late,
but what gets to me
more than anything
is instead of crying about it,
he's out there
with a big old smile
blowing fish faces at us.
Gentlemen, if you're smart,
you'll want me as much
for my dedication and ability
as for the fact that I am going
to ditch you right now
and I am going to run
like hell across town
so that my kid knows that
what matters to me most
is him.
And, Mr. Leland,
your real grounds for firing me
should be if I were
to stay here with you.
I like her.
A lot.
Well, I probably lost my job,
but at least
we still have 10 minutes
to get to the game.
Hey, short cut! Short cut!
In spite of everything, Jack,
I want you to know that
I do sincerely apologize
for losing Maggie.
That's all right.
Same thing happened to me this morning.
You lost Maggie this morning?
Yeah, she wandered off
after the office cat.
It might've been helpful
if you'd mentioned
her tendency to wander.
It might've been helpful...
Here we go. Up here...
If you had mentioned
Sammy's tendency
to stick things up his nose.
He didn't!
Oh, yeah. Way up there.
In fact, I had to use
this plier-type thing.
It's called an alligator,
a tool I have come to know well.
Okay!
Here we go. Come on.
See? I told you we'd make it.
Any other catastrophes?
Lois Lane ate the class fish.
Why does that not surprise me?
Sorry, Sammy.
Lois Lane?
Come on. We got to hurry up.
I got to go to the bathroom.
I'll take you.
Why don't I take her?
So, Maggie,
you know that lady Celia
from your dad's office?
Yeah.
Is she your daddy's girlfriend?
No way.
She wants to be, but she isn't.
He wants somebody
who would love his cookie, too,
and Celia's not the type.
Here. I'll get
that other sock for you.
There's no king
when love is the thing
Playing the same rules
In a heartbeat
a wise man can be a fool
Through the darkest hours
When all is said and done
It has to come
You go from lonely to the lucky one
'Cause love's funny that way
No matter who you are
It can shake your faith
Or it can break your heart
Yeah, yeah
Once in a while
the mountains are blue
We are lost
Yeah, yeah. Give me that.
It's my cat.
So maybe you and Maggie
could come over
for some dinner after the game.
We could order out
a little Chinese
or something.
Oh, thank God. He's here.
Dad!
So what do you say?
I don't think so.
It's been a long day.
Okay. Yeah, I'm a little...
little tired myself.
So I guess I should go over
and say hi to Sammy's dad.
I usually watch the game
over on the sidelines there.
That's where
I like to watch it.
Okay.
- It was a good day.
- Yeah.
Okay.
All right, come here.
What? You can't even look at me?
This is the second game
you've made it to in two years.
Look, I'm here, aren't I?
Daddy!
Are you staying
for the whole game?
- Are you?
- You bet I am.
Cool.
I'm gonna play my best.
You watch, my really best.
That's great.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Come on. I saved us a seat.
Here, Dad.
Marco. Marco, pass.
Marco.
Marco!
Hey, Dad!
Part of the reason
I came here today
was to tell Sammy in person
that I'm not gonna
be able to make
our fishing trip this summer.
You can't do this
to him, Eddie.
I got a gig
playing with Bruce, Mel.
Can't you see
how much he needs you?
Come on, Mel.
You can't expect me to pass this up.
Get it. Get it.
Mom! Hey, Mom, look!
Yes.
Let's go, Maggie. Come on!
Maggie, come on. Let's go.
Down the alley.
Right down the alley.
Let's go. Watch him.
Watch that kid.
Bodycheck him, Maggie.
Bodycheck him.
But that would be rude, Daddy.
That's not rude. That's sports.
There you go. That's it.
Hey! Hey! Come on.
What's with that guy?
Get that kid!
Good game there, Sammy.
Thanks, Jack.
I'll see you.
Thanks for everything.
You, too. I'll see you.
Okay, you ready?
Okay, hang on. Got it.
You were great.
So I'll see you
real soon, okay, big guy?
Okay.
Bye, Mel.
Bye.
Hey, let's get
your rain stuff on, okay?
Okay.
Let me see your trophy.
You think that's real gold?
Yeah.
You do?
What is that on his head?
Soccer ball.
Okay, you ready?
Should we try
to get a cab, Mom?
No. I kind of
feel like walking.
In the rain?
What do you care?
You're dressed for Niagara Falls.
Have I told you lately
that I love you
Have I told you
there's no one above you
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles
That's what you do
The morning sun in all its glory
Greets the day with hope
and comfort too
And you fill my life with laughter
You can make it better
Mom, I'm hungry.
I'll be right there, honey.
That's what you do
All right. That's a deal.
Gimme this one.
Good night.
Come here. Good night.
Good night.
He'll be right here
in the box, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
You know, Daddy,
when me and Melanie
were in the bathroom,
she asked me if Celia
was your girlfriend.
She did?
Yeah. She really likes you.
Good night.
Good night.
She told you she likes me?
It's so obvious, Daddy.
Good night.
Did she say
anything else about me?
I don't know, Daddy.
I'm pretty tired.
I'm gonna go to sleep now.
Yeah.
What are we gonna do
about those fish?
What?
We gotta go buy new fish.
Now?
Yeah. Now? Yeah. Sammy can't
go back to class tomorrow
without those fish.
By noon, they'll kill him.
But I'm in my pajamas.
All we gotta do
is pick 'em out.
And it shines like the sun
At the end of the day
We will give thanks and pray
To the one
Have I told you lately
that I love you
Have I told you
there's no one above you
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles
That's what you do
Take away my sadness
Fill my life with gladness
Ease my troubles
That's what you do
Fill my life with gladness
Take away my sadness
- Hi.
- Hi.
Maggie insisted
that we bring Sammy
some new fish.
Thank you.
Do you guys...
Do you want to come in
for a minute?
No. We don't want to intrude.
Okay. Well...
- Yes...
- Thanks.
Here they are. Okay.
Okay. Thank you.
Come on, Dad.
Come in. Please.
Okay. A few minutes.
Hi, Jack.
Sammy. Hi.
What do you weigh?
Wanna come see my room?
Okay.
You're investigating my apartment.
Not as neat as I would've thought.
It's only neat
on Sunday mornings
when my mother
comes for brunch.
If she sees it like this,
she shakes her head,
which means she's unhappy
with my life choices.
And then she lets out
a sigh that means
she would've rather have gone
to my sister's for brunch.
You guys wanna watch a video?
Yeah!
How about The Wizard of Oz?
Yeah!
You can get all
snuggled up on my bed
and watch for a little while.
I wanna watch
the whole thing, Mommy.
It's too late.
You can watch for as long
as it takes us to drink
one cup of coffee.
Two cups of coffee.
We'll see.
It's always such a dilemma
when you have kids.
After Sammy's dad and I
got divorced,
I put up pictures of him
all over Sammy's room.
I guess I wanted to reassure him
that no matter what,
his dad would still
be in his life.
You want cream or...
No, that's fine.
Sammy's very proud of his dad.
He talked about him
all day today.
I'm sure he did.
Is he really
a rock 'n' roll drummer?
Yeah. He's touring with
Springsteen this summer.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Springsteen?
I'm beating around the bush
here a little bit,
and there's something
I got to ask you.
Yes?
Why did you
spend the entire day
flirting with me if you
were thinking about getting
back with your ex-husband?
What?
I spent the whole day
disliking you intensely.
You were flirting with me.
You even told the kids
you wanted to ask me out.
I never told them that.
Yes, you did.
That was your big secret.
They told me.
It was all about you and me
and going somewhere
and feelings.
You were going to ask me out.
Okay. The big secret was about
Sammy getting my marble
stuck up his nose,
and I never once even thought
about asking you out.
I am so sure.
I don't know why
I would even want to.
You said you thought I was
the most beautiful woman
you'd ever seen.
- That was a line.
- That was not a line, Jack,
and you know it.
You wanted me ever since
I knew you were a writer, and you said...
And you wanted me
ever since the 9th Street
Drop-in Center
when you saw me
putting my watch on Maggie.
For someone who is
so totally disinterested
in the other person,
you sure do remember
every single minute detail.
You remember better than I do.
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
What would you do
if I kissed you right now?
You're not gonna
kiss me right now.
What would you do if I did?
Do you wanna kiss me right now?
I wouldn't have mentioned it
if I didn't.
Fine.
You're just
reeling me in, aren't you?
You're like Roy Scheider
in the end of Jaws.
The minute I open my mouth,
you're gonna drop
a big bomb in there.
Then you're gonna wear
a set of my teeth
around your neck.
So you're admitting
you're a big shark.
I am admitting that I am
scared of getting close
to anyone again.
I'm just as scared as you are.
- Don't bite.
- I won't.
Mommy.
What?
Can you fast-forward for us?
That mean lady's on,
and we hate that part.
Sweetheart, you know
how to use the fast-forward.
The remote's broken.
And she's stealing Toto.
There, she's gone. Okay?
This is the color part.
You love this part.
- Wait.
- Yeah. Okay.
No. Let's do this right.
Let me go in and freshen up
so I feel a little more
like a woman
and not a den mommy.
OK? Why don't you go in and...
Go sit over there,
and close your eyes,
lay your head back,
and anticipate my return?
Okay.
Or you can go in and watch
The Wizard of Oz
and wait for me to come back.
Yeah, okay.


One fine day
You'll look at me
And you will know our love was
Meant to be
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl


Though I know you're the kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
I'll be waiting
and someday, darling
You'll come to me
when you want to settle down
One fine day
We'll meet once more
And then you'll want the love you've
Threw away before
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl
One fine day
You'll want me for your girl
Stopped raining.
Jack?
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night
Step into the sun
Step into the light
Keep straight ahead
for the most glorious
I wonder what they're doing.
On the earth or the sun
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night
Step into the sun
Step into the light
Hold on to your breath
Hold on to your heart
Hold on to your hope
Step into the sun
Step into the light
March up to those gates
and they will
Open
You got to give a little
Take a little
And let your poor heart
break a little
That's the story of
That's the glory of love
You got to laugh a little
Cry a little
Before the clouds
go by just a little
That's the story of
That's the glory of love
And as long as there's the two of us
We've got the world
and all its charms
And when the world
is through with us
We've got each other's arms
You've got to win a little
Lose a little
And always have the blues a little
But that's the story of
And that's the glory of love
Are those your eyes
Is that your smile
Well, I've been lookin'
at you forever
But I never saw you before
Are these your hands
Holdin' mine
Now, I wonder how
I could've been so blind
For the first time
I am looking in your eyes
For the first time
I'm seein' who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're lookin' back at me
Now I understand what love is
Love is
For the first time
Can this be real
Can this be true
Am I the person I was this mornin'
And are you the same you
It's all so strange
How can it be
All along, this love
was right in front of me
And for the first time
I am looking in your eyes
For the first time
I'm seein' who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're lookin' back at me
Now I understand what love is
Love is
For the first time
Such a long time ago
I had given up
on finding this emotion
Ever again
But you're here with me now
Yes, I found you somehow
And I've never been so sure
And for the first time
I am looking in your eyes
For the first time
I'm seein' who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're lookin' back at me
Now I understand what love is
Love is
For the first time
