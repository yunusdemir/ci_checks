<i>Labaudieu Abbey
- Lorraine, France</i>
Not that room.
That's number 13. It's unlucky.
Nobody gets that room.
I'm not superstitious
Father.
A new brother has taken a room
not assigned to him.
JEAN RENO
CRIMSON RIVERS II
"ANGELS OF THE APOCALYPSE"
Hello, Father. Insp.
Niemans from Paris.
What's this about?
Holiday donations
Early this year.
Step aside.
I'll handle it.
Excuse us.
We're still in shock.
We don't want any bad press.
Me neither.
Must they come, too?
Which way?
Follow me.
Let's go, gentlemen.
Take a DNA sample.
Where can I wash my hands?
They won't answer you.
They've taken a vow of silence.
You're in a Montanist abbey.
Never heard of that
I suppose.
Montanus...
a preacher from
the second or third century.
Very impressive.
I thought
your order died out long ago.
We survived as best we could
until the ninth century in Lombardy.
Charlemagne's grandson
built this monastery...
our last and only refuge.
- How many of you in all?
- Thirty-two.
Anyone ever stray?
None.
When was
the wall redone?
A week ago
by a couple of local masons.
Is there a file?
No
we don't keep archives.
Tell me...
why are the monks' nails
so dirty?
The vegetable patch
requires much attention...
especially with
this erratic weather.
Excuse me
have you seen a little boy?
- Hey, little guy, what are you up to?
- Kevin! What are you doing?
Thank you, sir.
You scared me!
- You have a call.
- Thanks, I'll get it.
Hello? Hello? Hello?
I don't want to hear it.
Get me a religion expert
right away.
Thank you.
Niemans, the DNA came in.
Oxygen in the blood
means he was walled in alive.
Inspector
this will be your office.
We don't have his name.
GENOTYPEXPLORER
REPORTED MISSING
Philippe Esaquidar.
Is that him?
It was. Print it.
Agrarian plot, unit of measure
three letters.
Hectometer?
Three letters!
- Can I sleep?
- Sure.
We've already been here 19 hours
I'm just goofing around,
and you screw up my wrist.
The dealer's got a problem
or he's moved.
It's not his pad.
It's his girlfriend's.
Look.
What are you doing?
It's been three weeks in this hole
19 hours on her own...
I'll handle it.
Then we go.
Don't screw it up.
Hold it, we've been tailing
him for six months.
Six months is too long.
Penelope, is that right?
Sorry to disturb you.
Emilio gave me your address.
I've been out there for hours
and I'm freezing.
So I thought
the lovely Penelope...
would be kind enough
to offer me some coffee...
just to warm up.
I don't have coffee.
I have tea.
Tea it is.
Have a seat.
Have you known Emilio long?
I don't know, seven years?
- I don't have sugar.
- No problem.
Thank you.
Don't know why I let you in.
Emilio would never allow it.
He's always been paranoid.
Have you known him long?
We've done some
business together.
If Emilio wasn't so jealous...
I'd screw you right now.
You're sweet.
I bet you're a good lay.
- He's not going to do it?
- You're such an idiot.
I don't believe this.
Think Emilio will be here soon?
He'll be here.
You've got to go.
And I'll get laid.
Open up!
What the hell's up?
Dimwits
see anyone enter the building?
Nobody. Nothing in sight.
Open this door!
What are you doing
son of a bitch?
I said never
let anyone in. Bitch!
Do it again
I'll kill you!
Who the hell are you, asshole?
A cop?
Don't move! Damn it!
Let's see your hands!
Don't move, asshole!
Get up and get moving!
If you don't mind repeating
the same thing inside, and in French.
Philippe was
my oldest brother.
He wasn't a drinker and
didn't go out a lot.
He was a child prodigy.
Until he went off the deep end.
He was walled up
like Nostradamus.
Do you know why Nostradamus
was buried in a wall?
No.
Because he didn't want people
trampling on his tomb.
Do you think your brother...
Did he want...
He was nuts
but not that nuts.
He wanted to suffer like Christ.
I guess he got his wish.
Why did you speak to me
in German before?
No reason.
They're buying us out.
They constantly offer
to buy my place.
It's a chance to start over
somewhere else.
What's the point?
Judgment Day is almost here.
At least
that's what my brother said.
Was it long that he held...
such strange ideas?
Ever since he met
his master...
his light.
Does this light have
a name?
Jesus.
Two steaks got lost
in the forest.
It's night. When one steak turns
around nobody's there.
Suddenly the other steak appears.
Where the hell were you?
I was grounded.
I don't get it.
Shit!
Where the hell did he
come from?
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
- I didn't see him coming.
- Shit, he looks like Jesus.
It was safer on the cross!
Try not to move.
We'll get you to a hospital. Don't worry.
Park the car.
Have mercy!
where are you going?
Sir, can you hear me?
Do you understand me?
Did someone hurt you?
Have you been hurt?
Try to calm down!
Can't I take you to the hospital?
Sir, I can help.
I'm a cop, look.
Have mercy!
Calm down.
Call an ambulance!
Calm down.
Try to calm down.
Lord!
I can help. I'm a cop.
Lord!
Father!
Come to me!
Lord!
- They're coming.
- Who?
- They're here!
- Who's here?
What do we do, Reda?
That's not a nail
it's a 9mm.
Call an ambulance.
What the hell is this?
Would you cool it?
He's in the hospital.
Want a beer, Reda?
FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS
IDENTITY UNKNOWN
Hello. Insp. Niemans.
- What do you want?
- I would like to talk to you.
If you're looking for my husband
I've had no news for three months.
Not a word, not a sign. Nothing.
Excuse me.
Turn off the TV
Sebastien.
I met Mr. Michel Esaquidar
Philippe's brother.
A friend of your husband's
I believe.
The TV, Sebastien!
Haven't seen him for ages.
That's fine with me.
We found Philippe Esaquidar's body
yesterday morning.
- He's dead?
- Plastered in a monastery wall.
Go play in your room
children.
I knew there'd be trouble.
The monastery's cursed.
Everyone around here knew
but they wouldn't listen.
Who are "they"?
Listen, if you want me to find
your husband before he's hurt...
then tell me everything.
It's Andrew who dragged
him into this.
Andrew who?
I don't know.
And Thomas Duret.
He's a local mason.
But Andrew was behind it.
Since school
he's put ideas in his head.
How can I explain?
He's always seen Jesus in him.
It's true that my husband's face
is gentle and...
Tell me more.
Andrew bought the monastery
for a song.
What were his plans?
He said there were
many confused people in big cities...
and he wanted to offer
them spirituality.
He was very religious
like my husband.
It may seem strange
but they really loved people.
Real Christians.
They talked
about protecting people.
Protecting them from what?
From danger.
They were a faithful few...
and people felt it.
They had followers.
One day, the original owners
wanted the monastery back.
Did you know his disciples?
No. Only Andrew.
I never met the others.
How many are they?
Wait a minute.
Twelve.
How's our prophet today?
Just fine. He changed his routine
and sang a song all morning.
What kind?
A religious thing.
Sounded like a dirge.
That's not great for dancing.
Is that an invitation?
I'll see my friend.
I bet he's lonely up there.
He's not alone.
There's a priest with him.
A priest?
Father?
Father?
Come on, breathe!
breathe!
Don't let him out!
Shut the doors!
- An emergency in 22.
- Don't let him out!
Don't do anything stupid.
Hands up.
Mummy!
Stop!
Stop!
Nobody gets past!
That was
the 155th Artillery Division's motto.
Affirmative.
You were one of ours?
I wasn't
but my father was.
- Following in his footsteps?
- You could say that.
I'm looking for a worker here.
Follow me.
I'll show you around.
One hundred fifty kilometers
of tunnels.
Six of them just for
the Fermont fort.
At the time
there were six combat blocks...
and more than 600 men...
spread throughout
the Maginot Line tunnels.
This is it.
The end of the line.
Thanks.
I'm looking for a mason
Thomas Duret.
Me, too. I haven't seen him for
two weeks.
He hasn't picked up his pay.
When did you see him last?
Hey, fellas!
That's easy.
It was a Friday night, the seventh.
He said
"Bye", and that was it?
Not even. We knocked off at 6:00 P.M.
no Thomas.
- Didn't take his stuff.
- Anyone see a car?
No one.
Nobody saw him leave?
We don't spend
our weekends down here.
- Where does this lead?
- The next bunker, but it's abandoned.
Is there another exit?
I don't know, but it's at least 15 kilometers.
We can't go now, anyway.
Shit.
What the hell's that?
- This door wasn't here before?
- No.
Call this number.
Tell them Niemans said to send a unit.
All right.
Shit! Thomas.
What do you want?
You got a call.
They found Jesus.
- I don't know.
- You've got to make up your mind.
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing?
Mathilde told me
things heated up yesterday.
Forget the weather report.
You're not on duty?
Stop busting my balls
Reda!
- An inspector's up there.
- An inspector?
- Did he show you his card?
- No.
Keep an eye
on the entrance.
I should've been a doctor.
Hey, bullshit inspector.
Be good
turn around slowly.
Niemans?
What the hell are you doing here?
A bizarre case.
Guess who they send for.
You're not still in school?
That was years ago.
You're still not retired?
Get the recorder from
my pocket.
What did you give him?
C37.
It stimulates the cortex nerves
to awaken memory.
Police manual, Vol. 4
Chapter 12.
Narcotics
and pharmaceutical derivatives.
The Horsemen...
Lord
all four of them are here.
The seals...
they're going to break
the seals.
What are the seals?
The dead are returning.
The fifth seal's broken.
They're coming for
the Last Judgment.
God!
- What is it?
- You asked for an expert.
Yes.
I hold a PhD in religious science.
Western religion
and its modern application.
Pleasure to work with you.
The pleasure's mutual.
Only the inspector gets
a hello?
Sorry.
- Capt. Reda.
- Marie.
That's perfect. Meet Jesus.
He's babbling about
the end of the world.
When he hears
your name's Marie...
- We gave him a sedative.
- Yeah, an A-bomb in a drop.
It's all on tape.
They're here.
The angels...
of the Apocalypse.
Here.
- No sugar, right?
- Good memory.
- Still afraid of dogs?
- I'm better. I even adopted one.
No kidding.
A Doberman? Bull terrier?
A Yorkshire.
That's more like a guinea pig.
Feed him seeds.
The dog food will choke him.
Does the inspector's best friend
have a name?
- Nice work in the Alps.
- It was almost fatal.
Keeping an eye on me?
They almost lost a good teacher
at the academy.
Spare the flattery.
School's over.
I've prepared memos for you.
For you, the Apostles
description, experiences...
and for you
The Apocalypse of St. John.
I'm sure you'll like it.
How about a summary?
- A summary?
- Yes.
The Apocalypse is divided into seven seals
enclosing the sacred book.
Each stage holds a message
which then opens the next seal...
the seals Jesus spoke of.
First the horsemen
four of them.
The fifth seal awakens the dead
all clad in white.
The sixth seal
the earth rebels and rumbles.
Half an hour
of silence follows...
then the seven angels
of the Apocalypse appear.
Looks like the guy I chased.
Was he alone?
Yes, I think so.
Finally
the book written by God's hand.
The one who breaks the seventh seal
can commune with God.
It's pretty simple.
Does our Jesus know all this?
He genuinely believes
the end is coming.
Events must have triggered
his apocalyptic visions.
- You mean like the death of his apostles?
- Exactly.
Found something?
The motifs were carved near
the victims.
The symbols and names match.
A cross and two loaves for Philippe.
A square and lance for Thomas.
It's well thought out.
Don't touch anything.
POLICE
PRIVATE
My God!
We didn't touch a thing.
The bodies are in there.
A customer found them.
We questioned her.
Can I have their names?
Judas Marcherin and
Simon Viarnet.
They were associates.
Give me your notes, please.
Here.
Look.
- What?
- It's amazing.
What?
They have the same names
and jobs as the apostles.
Philip, the real apostle
ran his own business...
just like Philippe Esaquidar.
And St. Thomas was a mason
like Thomas Duret.
The apostles Judas and Simon Peter
were shopkeepers.
What did the seven
others do?
Bartholomew, administrator.
Matthew, customs officer.
Simon the Zealot had
no profession.
The other four were fishermen.
The parrot's
got to be a lab logo.
Find out who took the photo.
Reda, do research on the area.
See if an administrator or customs agent
was killed in the last few weeks.
Maybe it's not too late.
You said fishermen?
Why not just kill them?
Why all the drama?
To terrorize the others
in the photo so they don't talk.
Hello, sir.
- A glass of dry white wine.
- This isn't Alsace.
How about a glass
of milk, then?
Stop, Reda.
Three of the local stuff.
Recognize any of these men?
No, none.
- Are you sure?
- I'm not going to repeat it.
Maybe if I smash your place up good
it'll jog your memory?
The four guys on the left...
they have a little shack
on the lake behind the hill.
There are several artificial lakes
like this one here...
all developed in the '30s...
linked by the canal
for the mines.
It's a Maginot Line of water.
You see something?
Nothing.
I'm just a bit jumpy.
Looks like you're having fun.
This way.
I think I found something.
- I think we're on the wrong track.
- What do you mean?
I reread your notes, Marie.
The apostles
Peter, James, Matthew, and John, right?
Right.
They weren't catching fish.
It was shellfish.
These fishnets
don't have shellfish.
What about that?
Bring it up.
How long have
they been here?
Half an hour.
Call the others and help Reda!
- Are you hurt?
- I'm okay.
There must be a secret entrance
to get in there.
The original maps don't show it.
The Germans were here until 1945.
We don't know what they did.
Call Paris and get info
on the underground changes in 1940.
We found the photographer.
He manages a supermarket.
His name is
Bartholomew Debernault.
Another thing. A customs agent was
killed three days ago in an airport.
Marie
find the church in that photo.
Reda, come with me.
In French, father.
- In French.
- Of course.
Pardon me, I'm so excited.
Control yourself.
Don't be so emotional.
Most certainly.
Don't overplay the faith.
Customs officer savagely murdered
Do you know
Bartholomew Debernault?
Yes, he's in the store.
What did he do?
- Can you show me?
- Yes.
Michel, the store.
Lower screen.
- Bartholomew.
- He quit his job without explanation.
Did you notice any strange behavior?
He's jumpy lately.
He was the store manager.
What did he do?
Have the guards block
the entrances. Do it.
There!
I saw a priest.
Damn it!
I just saw him there.
Does this thing work?
Niemans, do you read me?
I read you.
Still nothing on the screens.
I don't get it.
Keep looking.
He didn't just disappear.
Aisle 12.
He's going
straight for Bartholomew, Reda.
Turn left, Reda.
Turn on the mike.
Bartholomew Debernault, run!
run!
There. Don't lose him.
I have him.
I need an analysis and
ID in two hours.
POLICE
What crappy weather.
We got the blood
analysis results.
- Can you sign this?
- What is it?
A request for another vehicle.
Considering the state of the last one...
Nothing out of the ordinary.
- No suspicious elements?
- No.
It can't be.
The blood can't be clean.
Unless he has
supernatural strength.
We failed.
They're all dead.
Why do you call me at work?
I don't know.
I'll call you later.
Just don't call me at work.
What's going on?
- What do they want?
- I don't know.
Watch out for those
two prying cops.
There'll be no more surprises.
Hello, gentlemen. Police.
It's 6:00 A.M.
and this is a search warrant.
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
Nobody leaves.
Heimmerich von Garten...
Minister of Culture and
Religious Affairs in Berlin.
Hold it.
We said nobody.
Remove your hand.
Let him go.
I could have you suspended
with a phone call.
See you very soon.
Get to work.
Search it from top to bottom!
- What do we do?
- Nothing.
Did you verify their
communications?
Not a phone call.
Keep it up.
Find something.
Nothing's turned up.
There's got to be something here
right under our noses.
- Is the church far?
- What church?
The church in the photo
with the apostles.
Still nothing on the monastery?
I found the Montanists' emblem.
Look.
What does JEO mean?
It's the Hebrew name of Yahweh.
In other words, the Father.
EO represents the son.
IEO, the Father, the Son and
the Holy Ghost. Three circles.
But I'm not totally sure
because of the upside-down "E."
Bernard, King of Italy, Louis I's nephew
himself Lothaire II's grandfather...
was chased from Italy
in 818 A.D.
He took the Vatican's
precious treasure.
It was so important
that the Vatican didn't dare confirm it.
Where did the treasure go?
With the only family member
left to him, Lothaire I.
Father of Lothaire II.
That's right.
But something strange.
Last week Lothaire II's seal
was stolen.
- What was the seal?
- A key.
What does it open?
Lothaire II’s tomb and
its treasure.
I have the police report.
What is the treasure?
Nobody knows.
It's said to be the finest treasure
a Christian can possess.
Where there's hate,
I bring love.
Where there's violence
I bring forgiveness.
Where there's discord
I bring harmony.
Where there's error
I bring truth.
Where there's doubt
I bring faith.
Where there's despair...
Father, please.
I wouldn't do that.
We need to talk.
It'll be fine. Come on.
Who is he?
- A survivor.
- A zealot.
The others
are they all dead?
Jesus is in the hospital.
Tell me what you know.
It's already too late.
We've incurred
the wrath of God.
- The angels of the Apocalypse are here.
- Here we go again.
Enough prophecies.
There's no apocalypse. We want to help.
Tell us what you know.
We're talking about the Great Book
written by the hand of God.
We were restoring
the monastery.
We discovered the entrance
to Lothaire's tomb...
and the treasure he brought
with him.
Did you steal the seal to
open the crypt?
I stole it.
And I came to hide here in
my former parish.
We were the only witnesses.
This treasure mustn't fall
into the wrong hands.
Where is the seal?
Give me a moment.
Get down!
Forgive me, Lord!
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
Niemans!
Are you okay?
How did you know
they planted a bomb?
You said
I'd be a good cop.
Where do you think
you're going?
I'd like to read these more closely.
I'll bring them back tomorrow.
Think you can do anything
because you're a cop?
No. No. No.
So you just plan to take
the sacred texts?
Are you even worthy of
reading them?
Who are you in God's eyes?
- Who?
- Have a problem, Father?
These texts are sacred.
If she wants to read them
I'd prefer she does it here.
You don't mean the Sacred Book
Lothaire had in his possession?
I don't know what you mean.
Don't you?
You need the key for the book.
And I've got it.
That can't be.
They have it.
They'll need it.
If not, the door won't
open tomorrow.
The door?
Where's the door, Father?
It's mine.
Soap?
Peddling fake relics for 2,000 years
now you know how it feels.
Take whatever you need.
Call a doctor.
Marie, hurry!
Our request to Germany
for the extensions to the Maginot Line.
There were no extensions
so there's no map.
Signed, Religious and
Cultural Affairs Office.
That's our friend Heimmerich.
Heimmerich von whatsit.
Why did the priest talk
about a door that must open?
Where the hell's that door?
I've found something.
The upside-down "E" was
bothering me.
Very simply because it's not an "E"
it's a three.
The "J" is a seven and
the "O" is a zero.
That makes 730,730.
What is that number?
The Montanists think
it's the date of the Apocalypse.
Jesus died April 7, 30 A.D.
If you count 730,730 days...
you get November 27 of
this year.
In other words, today.
Should we dress up for
the occasion?
We'll have front row seats.
What about the door?
Have you found anything?
Nothing.
An old text from the period...
says the treasure's protected
by an inviolable mechanism.
Those who read the sacred text
incur the wrath of God.
That's all I've come up with.
Nothing about how
to access it.
Have you ever heard
them ring?
The bells?
They never ring.
That's the underground
entrance.
Through the tower.
TOWER - CHURCH
Who the hell's here
at this hour?
Where did they come from?
This is the dawn of
a new Europe.
A pure Europe. One of faith
as it always should have been. A Europe...
Our Europe, Mr. Deputy, ours!
Where do you think you're going?
Nobody gets past.
- If we lose contact, call the army.
- Okay.
- I want to go.
- Go to the hospital and question Jesus.
And keep listening.
I'll need you.
Reda, you're going to get
your apocalypse.
Think it's deep?
I doubt our rope is
even long enough.
It's not a bottomless pit.
It's a ploy
to discourage meddlers.
Go on in.
I think he's sleeping.
Take it slowly, Reda.
Niemans.
The rope isn't
long enough.
If the monks come this way
there must be an entrance.
Niemans! Niemans!
Marie, are you there?
- Affirmative.
- He's got to talk.
- I sinned.
- Can you hear me, Marie?
I know.
Marie, can you hear me?
I hear you, Inspector.
We're in the Maginot Line.
Then it must be connected
to the monastery.
You're breaking up.
That's no surprise.
There's metal everywhere.
Can you hear me?
Here's your headless monk...
a ski mask
and black make-up around the eyes.
Then your imagination goes
to work.
These amphetamines
explain their uncanny strength.
They've been outlawed
since 1945.
Your strength doubles
and you don't feel any pain.
No wonder they whooped me.
Cover me!
Marie, send reinforcements!
You said, "See you soon."
Welcome to Lothaire II’s temple.
I was a very young officer
at the time...
when I happened upon
a section of this tunnel.
I wasn't able to explore it.
Victory was no longer with us.
For years, I read every book...
trying to find out what this
tunnel could be.
And one day
it became crystal clear.
The Vatican treasure
brought by Lothaire II...
had to be hidden
somewhere in the cavern.
I suppose you know the rest.
The apostles discovered
an entrance.
Probably the real one.
You found out
bought the monastery...
and eliminated
the 12 witnesses.
Our new Europe
has no interest in such details.
Reda! Reda!
Wake up!
Marie,
we've got a problem.
Marie.
Sermon on the Mount.
No one can serve two masters.
You cannot serve God and money.
They'll kill us all.
What's in the book?
- Marie, can you hear me?
- Not well, Inspector.
The tomb door is opening.
- Tell me where the book is.
- The sacred book.
- Nobody must know.
- Where is it?
Hidden.
Marie, the stone's opening.
Niemans, what's going on?
What's in the stone?
Marie, the stone has opened.
- It's a huge book.
- Stall for time. Let me think.
830 A.D. Geometry.
Heimmerich
don't touch the book, you'll die!
Don't talk of things
you know nothing of.
You are going to die.
I'm in great shape.
There's no way I'm dying.
As sure as the sun rises.
You're a real poet.
What's he saying?
Marie.
Marie, have you figured it out?
Opening the book
must set off a mechanism.
You see, the dreaded
Apocalypse has not come.
Marie
the book rests on a stand.
The axis, light, mirrors
weights, counterbalance...
Niemans!
Opening the book isn't dangerous.
Don't take it off its stand.
