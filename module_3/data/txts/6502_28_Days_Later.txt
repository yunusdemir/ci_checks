Bingo!
(chimps screeching)
Fucking hell.
(screech)
Fucking hell.
- Oh, God...
- Keep your shit together.
lf you wanna get 'em out of here.
- l can pop these, no problem.
- So get to it!
Security, we have a break-in. Get the...
l know who you are.
l know what you think...
lf you don't wanna get hurt,
keep your mouth shut and don't move.
The chimps are infected. They're highly
contagious. They've been given an inhibitor.
- lnfected with what?
- To cure, you must first understand.
lnfected with what?
Rage.
- What is he talking about?
- Get the cages open.
No! No! No!
Listen, you sick bastard,
we're taking your torture victims with us.
We'll get you out of here.
The animals are contagious. The infection
is in their blood and saliva. One bite...
Stop... Stop! You've no idea!
(screaming)
Get it off! Help me!
Get it off! Get it off!
- What's the matter with her?
- You have to kill her!
(screams) Oh, my God!
- What's the matter with her?
- We have to kill her now!
Oh, God...
(screaming)
(sharp intake of breath)
Hello?
(coughs)
Hello?
(louder) Hello!
(belches)
Hello?
Hello!
(alarm)
Hello?
Hello?
(noises from behind door)
(gasping and retching)
Father?
Father, are you OK?
Oh, shouldn't have done that.
Shouldn't have done that.
Shit!
(man) Over here!
- Over here!
- Come on!
Go, go, go!
Keep going!
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just shut up!
- Covered everything.
- Who are those people?
Let's go! Let's go!
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just move!
Come on!
Man walks into a bar with a giraffe.
They each get pissed.
The giraffe falls over.
The man goes to leave and the barman says
''Oi! You can't leave that lying there.''
He says ''No, it's not a lion. lt's a giraffe''.
He's completely humourless.
You two should get on like a house on fire.
So who are you?
You're from the hospital.
- Are you a doctor?
- He's not a doctor. He's a patient.
l'm a bicycle courier.
l was riding a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.
Then l wake up today in hospital.
l wake up and l'm...
l'm hallucinating or l'm...
What's your name?
Jim.
l'm Mark. This is Selena.
OK, Jim.
l've got some bad news.
lt started as rioting, and right from
the beginning you knew this was different.
Because it was happening
in small villages, market towns.
And then it wasn't on the TV any more.
lt was in the street outside.
lt was coming through your windows.
lt was a virus.
An infection.
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.
lt was the blood.
There was something in the blood.
By the time they tried to evacuate
the cities, it was already too late.
The infection was everywhere.
The army blockades were overrun.
And that's when the exodus started.
The day before broadcasting stopped,
there were reports of lnfection
in Paris and New York.
We didn't hear anything more after that.
- What's the government doing?
- There's no government.
Of course there's a government!
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane...
No, there's no government,
no police, no army.
No TV, no radio, no electricity.
You're the first uninfected person
we've seen in six days.
Where's your family?
They're dead. Like Selena's.
Yours will be dead too.
Look, l have to find them.
They live in Deptford. l can walk it. OK?
You'll go and come back, yeah?
- You won't.
- Yes!
No one ever comes back.
So lesson one.
You never go anywhere alone
unless you've got no choice.
Lesson two.
Only travel during daylight.
Unless you've got no choice.
We'll take you tomorrow.
We'll all go and find
your dead parents together, OK?
Eat.
lf you want her to slow down,
you'll have to say.
- lf there's anyone...
- l understand.
- Anyone...
- l understand!
OK.
(sniffs)
Jim...
Wait!
They died peacefully.
You should be grateful.
l'm not grateful.
My...
parents and my sister,
we went to Paddington Station,
hoping maybe we could get on a plane,
maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.
l remember my dad had all this cash,
even though cash was completely useless.
About 20,000 other people had the same idea.
Crowd was surging.
l lost my grip on my sister's hand.
l remember the ground was soft.
l looked down
and l was standing on all these people.
Like a carpet. People who had fallen and...
Somewhere in the crowd
there were lnfected. lt spread fast.
No one could run.
All you could do was climb.
Climb over more people.
So l did that. l climbed.
And l got up on top of this kiosk.
Looking down, you couldn't tell
which faces were infected and which weren't.
Then l saw my dad.
Not my mum or my sister.
My dad.
His face...
Selena's right.
You should be grateful.
We don't have time to get back to the shop
before dark. We should stay here tonight.
My room's up at the top.
You two can have that.
No, we'll all sleep in the same room. lt's safer.
(radio)
Jim.
- You're back.
- Yeah.
- How was it?
- Fine.
Give me a drink of that, will ya?
- lt's empty.
- Ha!
Here.
l'll start working on them, then.
Mark! Mark!
Selena! Help!
(Selena) lt's clear.
- That's Mr Bridges.
- Were you bitten?
And his daughter. From four doors down.
- Were you bitten?
- No.
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?
No.
Mark?
Wait...
(Mark screams)
Get that cleaned off.
Do you have any clothes here?
Um... l... Yes.
Then get them and get dressed.
We have to leave now.
More lnfected will be coming.
They always do.
(Jim) How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?
- The blood.
- There was blood on me. lt was on you.
l didn't know he was infected.
He knew. l could see it in his face.
lf someone gets infected,
you've about 20 seconds to kill them.
lt might be your brother, your sister
or your oldest friend. lt makes no difference.
Just so you know where you stand,
if it happens to you, l'll do it in a heartbeat.
He was full of plans.
Have you got any plans, Jim?
Do you want us to find a cure and
save the world orjust fall in love and fuck?
Plans are pointless.
Staying alive's as good as it gets.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's that?
Let's go.
What is it about tower blocks
and shopping trolleys?
Stop talking. lt's a long way up.
(Selena) Do you need a break?
- You?
- No.
Now l do need a break.
What's up?
Nothin'.
l got a headache.
- Bad?
- Pretty bad.
- Why didn't you say something before?
- l didn't think you'd give a shit.
You've got no fat on you
and all you've had to eat is sugar.
So you're crashing.
There isn't a lot we can do about that
except pump you full of painkillers
and give you more sugar. As for sugar,
Pepsi or Lilt?
Do you have any Tango?
Actually,
l did have a can of Tango somewhere.
(screech)
Quiet! That's an lnfected.
Oh no, they're in. Move!
Wait up, Selena!
Wait for me, please!
Please, Selena! Please!
- Wait for me!
- Come on!
- Run!
- Wait!
Please! For fuck's sake!
- Selena!
- (screams)
Down the corridor. Flat 157. Move!
Thank you. Thank you.
Open the door!
Open the door!
- Open up!
- Where's Dad?
What?
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Dad?
Let them in, Hannah. Let them inside.
Go in. Go in!
( ''Frosty the Snowman'")
So, l'm Frank, anyway.
Jim.
- Selena.
- Selena. Good to meet you.
This is my daughter Hannah.
Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.
Come on.
So...
This is great. Just great.
Calls for a celebration, l'd say.
Why don't you all sit down and...
Hannah, what have we got to offer?
We've got Mum's creme de menthe.
Great. Creme de menthe.
Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please.
Get comfortable.
- (Frank) Where are the bloody glasses?
- Middle cupboard.
Nah, the good ones. lt's a celebration.
Top cupboard.
So this is your place?
lt's nice.
There.
l know it isn't much but, well, cheers.
Cheers.
(groans)
You OK in there, Jim?
Yeah.
Sorry we couldn't spare the water.
Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.
You'll have to use the bucket.
Have to empty it each morning.
Just chuck it over the balcony.
No mod cons here.
lt's fine.
Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in.
We have a spare room.
ln there.
Are you and Selena...?
No. No, no, no.
Um...
l'll take the living room. lt's fine.
Right.
No, l mean, yeah.
So, um...
- Goodnight, then.
- Yeah. Goodnight, Frank.
Very spruce.
- Very shredded.
- Yeah.
- So what do you make of them?
- Well, they're desperate.
Probably need us more than we need them.
l think they're good people.
- Good people?
- Yeah.
You should be more concerned about
whether they're gonna slow you down.
- Because if they slowed you down...
- l'd leave them behind.
- ln a heartbeat.
- Yeah.
l wouldn't.
Then you're gonna wind up
getting yourself killed.
l'm gonna get some sleep.
Selena...
You think l don't get it, but l do get it.
And l know l'd be dead already
if l hadn't met you.
Sure.
No, look...
l mean, thank you.
And l mean, sure.
Goodnight, Jim.
Goodnight.
We lost water pressure three weeks ago.
l thought we'd be OK with the water
from the other flats. Cisterns and tanks.
But it vanishes so quick
you wouldn't believe.
You drink it,
it evaporates,
turns stagnant.
They're all empty.
Hasn't rained in ten days.
You can set up a plastic sheet
to catch dew and condensation.
Saw it on TV once, but l can't make it work.
You'd never think it.
Needing rain so badly.
Not in fucking England!
Jim, we're not going to be able to stay here.
- There's been no broadcasts for weeks.
- Just listen.
(man on radio) Salvation is here.
The answer to lnfection is here.
if you can hear this, you're not alone.
There are others like you.
There are other survivors.
We are soldiers and we are armed.
Oh, my God. Soldiers.
- Quiet. There's more.
- Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602,
27 miles northeast of Manchester.
- You must find us. Salvation is...
- Now itjust repeats.
- lt's a recording?
- Yeah, it's a recording.
But this is where it's telling us to go.
Just there.
The way things are, we might need
two or three days to get up there.
''We''?
Sound carries in this flat. Me and Hannah
do need you more than you need us.
- Look, l didn't...
- No, it's OK. lt's the truth.
l can't leave the block if it's the two of us.
Something might happen to me.
Hannah'd be alone. l couldn't risk it.
But with other people...
lf it's a recording,
the soldiers who made it could be dead.
- lt's possible.
- That stuff about the answer to lnfection...
There is no answer!
lt's already done all the damage it can!
- Maybe they have a cure.
- Maybe they've got nothing.
- The only way to find out is to reach them.
- We could die trying, Frank!
Or die here.
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.
We need each other.
And we'll never be safe in the cities.
The soldiers could keep us safe.
So we have to try and get there.
Get there how?
Just so you know,
l don't take cheques or credit cards.
- (Frank) What do you think?
- lt's the most direct route.
Then we should take the indirect route.
The one in daylight and not underground.
(Frank) Let's just get it done.
(Jim) No, no.
No. See, this is a really shit idea.
You know why?
Because it's obviously a shit idea.
So we're gonna drive into the tunnel
full of fucking smashed cars...
lt's really fucking obviously a shit idea!
Hold on!
Dad!
(screaming and laughing)
Fuck!
The world's worst place to get a flat.
Agreed. l think we'd better do this quick.
l've got the wheel. You're on the jack.
Do you hear that?
Hey, hey, do you hear that?
Hear what?
(Hannah) Right, l've done it.
Dad?
(scrabbling sounds)
- Jesus Christ!
- (Hannah screaming)
Fucking rats!
They're running from the lnfected.
Move it!
Forget the jack, Hannah.
There's no time. Just lift, everyone.
Grab hold! One, two, three, lift!
Lift, lift!
- (Selena) Don't look at them! Don't look!
- (Jim) l can see them! They're coming!
(screeching)
Come on, Hannah!
Almost.
- Get the tyre on, Hannah!
- l'm trying.
Three, two, one,
drop it!
- Get in the car!
- Come on!
- Frank, drive!
- Move it, Frank!
(Jim) Whoo!
Goodbye, you fuckers!
Frank, stop the cab.
Let's shop.
(Frank making engine noises)
You...
You...
You...
(Jim) Anybody seen any buns?
Hmm. lrradiated.
Don't take anything
that needs to be cooked, OK?
l think you can eat that raw.
Decaffeinated coffee...
Put that back.
Can'tjust take any crap.
lf l never see another chocolate bar again,
it'll be too soon.
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange!
Now, single malt,
16-year-old, dark, full flavour.
Warm but not aggressive.
- (Hannah and Selena laughing)
- Peaty aftertaste.
Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth.
Either we do this now or we're walking.
Not you.
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?
You heard.
Where are you going?
We've got enough food, Jim.
We don't have any cheeseburgers.
(quietly) Like going on holidays
with your aunt!
Oh, Jesus.
Hello?
l hate you!
Find anything?
- Find anything, Jim?
- No! Let's get outta here.
OK, we're done here.
OK, Hannah.
Easy. Brake!
Brake, brake!
Out.
(Selena) Mmmm! Oh my God!
l can, like, taste the vitamin C.
Mmmm, the raisins are so moist.
What did you say?
The raisins. They're so moist.
Look over here.
Like a family.
(Hannah) Do you think they're infected?
(Frank) No.
They're doing just fine.
Come on. Let's eat!
Know what l was thinking?
That you'll never hear
another piece of original music again.
You'll never read a book
that hasn't already been written,
or see a film that hasn't already been shot.
Um.... that's what you were thinking.
No.
l was thinking l was wrong.
About what?
All the death.
All this shit.
lt doesn't really mean anything
to Frank and Hannah because...
Well, she's got her dad
and he's got his daughter. So...
Cheeky monkey!
l was wrong when l said
staying alive is as good as it gets.
See, that's what l was thinking.
Was it?
Mm. You stole my thought.
Sorry.
That's OK.
You can keep it.
lt's getting late.
We'd better stay here for the night.
l can't sleep.
Me neither.
Doesn't feel safe, does it?
Outside like this.
l think we're safe enough.
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.
Yeah, l noticed that.
Hey, Selena...
What? What is it?
How'd you get to sleep?
Bloody hell. Must've needed
a hell of a prescription for that lot.
l didn't need a prescription.
l qualified as a chemist.
Oh, great. Valium.
Not only will we be able to get to sleep
but if we're attacked in the middle
of the night, we won't even care.
- Two each.
- Not for me, thanks.
Can l, Dad?
l don't think so, sweetheart.
Please?
- No.
- l can't sleep.
Come on, Frank. Let her live a little.
- Give her half of one.
- All right. We're on.
Night-night.
You're a big softie, Frank.
Frank?
Hannah?
Frank?
Hello? Hello!
Hello!
Hello! Hello!
(mumbles)
Shh...
You're having a bad dream, that's all.
Thanks, Dad.
(car horn)
Come on, sleepyhead.
Come on, Babe Ruth.
(Frank) Hurry up.
- Did l miss breakfast?
- (Selena) You'll sleep through anything.
- (Jim) Did you have a fry-up?
- (Frank) We'll stop at a pub on the way. Door!
(radio) Our location
is the 42nd blockade, the M602,
27 miles northeast of Manchester.
You must find us. Please!
Salvation is here.
The answer to lnfection is here.
Must be Manchester.
The whole of Manchester, the whole city.
No fire crews to put it out.
42nd blockade.
This is it.
l don't understand, Dad.
Did they leave?
- l don't like this. l think we should go.
- No!
Vehicles. We should check the vehicles.
There has to be something.
Nothing.
l can't believe it.
Frank...
Frank!
- We have to go.
- Yeah.
Go fucking where?!
(cawing)
Get out of it.
Get out of it!
Dad, are you all right?
Yeah, l'm fine, sweetheart.
Sorry l lost my temper.
Hannah...
l love you very much.
- What?
- Keep away from me.
Stay where you are.
- Dad?
- Keep away from me! Keep away from me!
Keep away! Keep away! Keep away!
- Dad!
- Keep away! Keep away!
(Hannah) What's wrong? Dad!
Jim! Jim, he's infected!
- No!
- Now, Jim! Now!
- Jim, kill him! Jim!
- Dad!
Kill him!
Stay away from him!
Keep away from the body!
Dad?
(man) Three survivors. One male, two female.
l repeat, one male, two female.
ETA, 15.
Put the kettle on.
l'm Major Henry West.
- Welcome.
- Jim.
Hello, Jim.
Hello.
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets
and a boiler that produces hot water.
So you can all have a shower.
You look like you need one. Please.
lt ain't funny. l got loads of cooking to do,
you fucking Doris!
Run him over!
(Jim) How is she doing?
She's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is.
lt's all fucked.
What do you mean?
Oh, don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, don't do that.
Hannah is what Frank says she is. Tough,
strong, and she'll cope just like l'll cope.
- Just like you'll cope.
- l don't want her to have to fucking cope.
l want her to be OK.
When Hannah had her dad it was OK.
lt was OK for them and it was OK for us.
Now it's all just fucked.
So you heard our broadcast?
- Yeah, we did.
- We must be a disappointment.
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army
base with helicopters and a field hospital.
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to lnfection.
Yeah.
As l said before, it's here. Though
it may not be quite what you imagined.
- Just feel lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.
The fire drove hundreds of lnfected
out of Manchester.
The surrounding area's teeming with them.
But don't worry.
You're quite safe here.
Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights
which we've rigged up to a generator.
High perimeter wall which helps.
And we've been lacing the ground
with tripwires and land mines.
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn,
but if they get in, we hear them.
Secondary to protection,
our real job is to rebuild. Start again.
The belly of the house. The heart.
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot
water. The first step towards civilisation.
The kitchen.
Here you are. l'll swap you.
- Now don't be throwing it.
- Here, give us some.
Don't be fighting.
Will you put that back? Put it back.
Jones, our resident tin opener.
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.
l can't wait.
And lastly, meet Mailer.
Mailer, Jim.
Jim, Mailer.
Got infected two days ago.
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold
and we got a chain round his neck.
Keeping him alive?
The idea was to learn something
about lnfection.
Have him teach me.
And has he?
ln a way.
He's telling me he'll never bake bread.
Farm crops,
raise livestock.
He's telling me he's futureless.
And eventually he'll tell me how long
the lnfected take to starve to death.
(singing)
You'll have to wait and see
Hope it's chips, it's chips
We hope it's chips, it's chips
(cheering)
Hat.
So, what have we here?
Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and...
- (man) Nice one, Doris!
- Omelette!
- lt's a feast, Jones.
- Honour of our guests.
Absolutely. l was going to propose a toast
but this omelette will do just as well.
- To new friends.
- (all) New friends.
Jones, did you notice while cooking
that these eggs were off?
l thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.
Get rid of it.
(man) Doris, you twat.
l don't suppose you can cook, can you?
l can't tell you how badly we need
someone with a little flair in the kitchen.
What a fucking disappointment.
l saw those eggs, l thought it was Christmas.
We'll have eggs again.
Once everything's back to normal.
You muppet! Look at him, eh?
He's still waiting
for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.
- You don't know nothing.
- l think Bill's got a point.
lf you look at the whole life of the planet,
we...
you know, Man has only been around
for a few blinks of an eye.
So if the infection wipes us all out,
that is a return to normality.
- That what you meant, Bill?
- Yeah, yeah.
Have you met our New Age sergeant?
Our spiritual guru.
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why
did you join the army in the first place?
This is what l've seen
in the four weeks since lnfection.
People killing people.
Which is what l saw in the four weeks before
lnfection, the four weeks before that...
As far back as l care to remember,
people killing people.
Which to my mind
puts us in a state of normality now.
- You're not eating?
- l don't want to eat.
You must eat, Hannah.
l don't want to eat.
l want to bury my dad.
He's one of the people you're talking about.
(explosion)
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Move!
Move! Move! Move!
(siren)
Enemy in front!
Mick, l fucking got one!
What do you want, a fucking sweetie?
Keep shooting, you cunt!
Fucking hell! He bounced!
Cease fire!
l ain't never seen that in my life!
- Report clear!
- Fucking hell!
- Clear.
- Clear.
Yeah, yeah, clear.
Oh, hello!
(woif whistle)
Listen, sweetheart, you ain't
gonna be needing this any more.
Cos you got me to protect you now.
You wanna get your hands on a really
big chopper, you just come and see me.
Fuck you!
- That's an offer, Mitch.
- Give her some.
How about right now?
Mitchell!
Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go
picking a fight with me, son.
Sergeant Farrell!
- Mitchell, first action on.
- Resecure the perimeter.
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.
Slow down.
- Sergeant?
- Sir.
Clear the bodies off the lawn.
The rest of you, go with him.
My apologies.
Drink?
Look, we're grateful, OK?
We're very grateful for your protection
but if we're gonna stay here...
- Who have you killed?
- No one.
Who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive
now if you hadn't killed somebody.
l killed... l killed a boy.
A child?
Yes.
But you had to.
Otherwise he'd have killed you.
Survival.
l understand.
l promised them women.
What?
Eight days ago l found Jones
with his gun in his mouth.
He said he was going to kill himself
because there was no future.
What could l say to him?
We fight off the lnfected or we wait
until they starve to death and then what?
What do nine men do
except wait to die themselves?
l moved us from the blockade, l set the radio
broadcasting and l promised them women.
Because women mean a future.
Selena! Hannah!
- What is it?
- We have to go.
- Jim, wait!
- No time! Come on!
Come on!
We get in the car and we go!
No! You're not going to keep them here!
You've got to let them go!
You can't keep them here!
Stay where you are!
l'm not gonna let you keep them here!
You can't do this!
Right, get him!
l want to give you a chance.
You can be with us.
But l can't let them go.
OK, Jim? OK.
Him too.
(Farrell) Smithers says
''Women and semen don't mix.''
And Mr Burns says
''We all know what you think, Smithers.''
And that was my favourite joke
in The Simpsons.
That's what they're doing a few
hundred miles away, across the Channel,
across the Atlantic. Eating dinner
and watching the fucking Simpsons!
They're sleeping in their beds
next to their wives.
But we're here chained to a fucking radiator
because the OC has gone insane!
Starting the world again when the rest
of the world hasn't even stopped.
Just imagine, just think about it.
How could lnfection cross the oceans?
How could it cross the mountains
and the rivers? lt can be stopped.
Right now TVs are playing
and planes are flying
and the rest of the world
is continuing as fucking normal.
Think! Actually think about it.
What would you do
with a diseased little island?
They quarantined us.
''There is no lnfection.
lt's just people killing people.'' He's insane!
Time to go.
Quarantine?
- Please...
- Believe me, l'm not interested.
You see, l'm gonna have the black one.
And l'm gonna make her squirm.
Mitchell, l swear to God

Move.
Come on, move! Get up!
Get up, you cunt! Fucking move!
Get up!

(Jones) No, Mitch. Mitch, just use the gat.

- (Mitchell) Why?
- Because it's fucking quicker!
(Farrell) ls that how you'd let
your sergeant go out, Jones?

- No, you won't.
You'll let him stick me?
Like a fucking dog?

You stupid cunt! What are you doing?
You wanna shoot me?

Fuck it! Get up! Get after him!

Where are you?
- Can you see him?
- Through there!
(gunfire)
Oh no. We're fucked.
We're fucked!
Relax.
He's over the wall. He's got no vehicle.
And no shooter.
He's dead.
(thunder)
(West) The first thing we're going to do
is make you look more presentable.
The lady of the house
has an extensive wardrobe
which she certainly has no use for.
You can't do it to Hannah.
Go to the master bedroom,
pick out a wide selection.
Yes, sir.
(Hannah) No...
(man) Ladies...
- lt's only dressing up!
- No! Selena!
- l thought girls liked dressing up.
- Expensive dresses.
(Hannah) Selena!
Whoa, whoa, relax!
Selena!
Selena! Selena!
You need to leave me alone
with Hannah. OK?
- Listen, right. The OC wants...
- He wants us to dress up nice.
lf you want us to get changed,
you have to leave the room. OK?
lt's just polite.
Yeah, all right.
All right.
Come on, lads. Let's leave the room.
We're gonna eat these, Hannah, OK?
Come on. Eat these.
Are you trying to kill me?
No, sweetheart.
l'm making you not care. OK?
What you doing?!
(siren)
- Someone's at the blockade!
- Jim!
Move!
Stay here and put the dresses on.
Let's go! Go!
He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead.
Shut up, Jones! Stay here.
Davis?
(engine fails)
Fuck it!
(gunfire)
- What was that?
- Lightning.
l heard something.
lt sounded like a Claymore to me.
All right, l'll go and hit the floods,
take a butcher's.
Girls,
keep an eye on him, will ya?
Those pills,
l think they're having an effect.
l can feel them. And...
l don't feel sleepy.
But...
They've been a long time.
What are you gonna do
if they don't come back?
Would you be the officer if Henry was dead?
ls that the way it works?
Shut up.
l don't think they are coming back.
l think they've been killed.
- l said shut up!
- Hannah...
They're dead.
And you're gonna be next.
- Get up!
- Whoa!
We're gonna get out of here.
Stay with it, Hannah.
Don't worry. l feel fine. Really.
Get him off me!
Get him off me!
lt's Jones! lt's Jones!
Oi! Where the fuck are you going?
What's all the fucking shouting about?
(screaming)
Don'tjust stand there,
you soppy cunt! Get after them!
You two, in there! Move!
(wheezing)
Come on, then!
What the fuck you gonna do now?
(screaming)
Come on up!
Col!
- Defend these stairs with your fucking life!
- Hannah!
- Mailer's loose.
- Hannah!
(screech)
(screeching and wheezing)
Sorry...
- Sir...
- Shh.
Shh.
Hannah?
(screech)
Hannah?
Selena?
l haven't got any bullets.
l haven't got any fucking bullets!
Don't fucking leave me!
Come on!
Move!
Move! Move!
lt's just you and me now, darlin'.
But don't worry, l'll get you out of here.
Then we'll find a nice little fucking place
somewhere. Just you and me.
And we'll live happy ever after, eh?
(screaming)
That was longer than a heartbeat.
Jim?
Listen. Listen. lt's not all fucked.
We're gonna be OK. lt's not all fucked.
- l've got to explain something.
- Shut up.
lt's gonna be OK.
Hannah, it's OK! He's not infected.
But l thought he was biting you.
l was kissing her. Are you stoned?
- lt's a long story.
- (screeching)
We have to get out of here. Come on!
Come on! Move!
You killed all my boys.
Wait...
Hannah!
Hannah? Hannah!
Hannah!
Get in.
They're locked.
The gates are locked!
Fucking do it!
Come on, Jim, breathe! Fucking breathe!
Not the curtains as well.
(man speaking on radio)
You looked all right in this, you know.
lt's coming!
- You definitely heard it?
- Yeah!
- l can't hear anything!
- l told you, l heard it!
(distant aircraft)
Go.
Do you think he saw us this time?
