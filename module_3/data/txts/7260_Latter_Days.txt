When I first came to Los Angeles,
it looked like just this mass of dots...
all jumbled and disconnected.
It was pretty disorienting.
What the fuck are you doing? I'm straight!
That is so hot when guys say that!
No, I'm serious dude.
Oh really? It's too bad. 'Cos I'm amazing.
I don't like to brag, but ...
I can suck the engine block to the
tail pipe of a '58 Chevy.
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm talking one of the big ones with the 380s.
Oh. So you know cars, yeah?
And beer!
See, unlike with women, if you can
crack one open right after...
...hell! You can have one during.
It can just be a little fun between
buddies, you know.
And you'll never have to call me.
Till you're up for another round, that is.
Wow!
You're not...
...worried about Elizabeth coming in?
Elizabeth? My roommate is Julie.
I'm here for a date with Elizabeth.
Elizabeth is 243D, as in
'down the walk'.
This is 243B....
...as in 'blowjob'.
You're not ‘Straight Curious’ from AOL?
No.
Not again!
Oh, shut up! You are so lying to me!
Ah-ha! Check the journal! Look!
September 20th. Oh my God!
That is so funny!
So maybe you should write
a song about that.
I can't believe you've almost
done with your demo
and you haven't written a song
about your best friend.
Yeah, I can't believe that the
tree falls in the forest
that wouldn't have something
to do with you.
Hey J, Martinis - vodka or gin?
Gin, and you, you can tell that friend
of yours to go fuck himself.
You know, I only have one
friend who can
actually do that, and I doubt
you've met.
I mean the bass player. We were just
supposed to lay down some tracks...
by the second song it was like my
bra had grown hands.
Excuse me, wannabees, order up.
One call-back, she's Margo Channing
Second call-back, thank you.
Second lead in the feature.
I'm so getting this. Soon, I can
kiss you losers goodbye
and finally justify moving to this
miserable fucking town.
You ever read for Barry Wolf?
Hey, why are we skipping on the fries?
Come on, load me up.
Barry Wolf read me once
for this commercial,
he was licking me with his eyes
the whole time.
They don't call him the 'Wolf who
cried Boy' for nothing.
You know, he wouldn't even
see me for that
crappy TV 'Wacky Gay Neighbor' thing?
- What's that about?
- I'm gay, I'm wacky.
- Maybe you're not neighborly.
- Fuck you. I'm Donna Reed on a stick.
Excuse me, darlings. I hate
to interrupt this
important discussion between
all you big stars...
- I'll settle for medium star.
- Point well taken.
In the meantime, I hear that Disney’s
opening a Fantasia restaurant
where the plates fly themselves
to the tables.
- Until then, what to do?
- Hot stuff, coming through.
- Yes!
Hi guys.
- You take one of my tracks and give the
karaoke at Funny Boys.
- Julie!
- Also two-for-one margaritas?
- I'll be there.
Enjoy your meal.
Quit gawking, we don't have all day.
- Ow, fuck.
- Yeah, fuck you too.
- Mum?
- Julie. Where the hell are you?
I'm here. Isn't this where you called me?
Where did we end up last night?
I don't know, but I woke up without my bra.
That's never a good sign.
I wouldn't worry about it.
So, why are you calling me and
not just tiptoeing
across the hall with sympathy
and Excedrin?
- I tried that, I thought you'd gone. Spin class is starting.
- Oh fuck.
Hey, hold up a minute.
- We've met.
- Um, no, I'm brand new here.
- Hey, Green, let's get a move-on, huh?
- Gotta go.
- All unpacked.
- Final bell. Harmon is down.
Hey Gilford why don't you come over
here and give me a back rub?
Wrong tree, barking, if you think I'm
rubbing your pimply back, ya homo.
- Davis? Come on, Green, help a guy out, right?
- Stuff to put away.
Come on, Gil, just like ten minutes.
You know I'd give you one.
- You're on.
- No, I asked you first.
- Nope.
Aah, that hurts! Prepare to die, dude.
- Hey.
- Hi!
- You remember me, from across the way?
- Yeah. Harmon!
I brought you guys a 'Welcome
to the complex' sixer.
Uh, thanks, but we don't drink.
What kind of frat boys are you?
Who called up ‘Deliver-A-Fag’?
- Geez, Ryder a little louder and he'll probably hear you.
- I don't care
You see those flippin' shorts he was wearing?
- Just check that.
- Okay, three of these.
There was the most adorable man,
Daniel, here this evening.
- I thought I might introduce you.
- Really?
- Blue shirt, end of the bar?
- Actually yes.
- Daniel. We've met.
August, 3rd I belie... yep.
Oh, not so good, not so good.
Andrew, can I have a glass of
that Merlot, there?
Sure thing. And Ben called for you, Miss M.
Well, I suppose if he calls this
late in the week,
I can call him this late in the evening, right?
- Absolutely.
- Cheers.
Oh oh, you guys wanna hear something freaky?
Remember those four people
that moved into Elizabeth's old apartment?
Guess what they do.
- Quadruplet porn stars.
- This town? Hardly freaky.
They're rodeo clowns.
No, no, no, listen, it's even weirder than that.
They are Mormon missionaries, swear to God.
- Oh.
-Although rodeo clowns would’ve
been kinda cool.
They must've loved your aberrant lifestyle.
I dated a Mormon guy once.
His family put him through shock therapy.
When you'd have sex, he was a wild man!
Then he'd wanna throw himself
out the window.
- So, you live on the first floor.
- Yes, but it's hell on my azaleas.
- Wouldn't it be funny if you converted them
instead of them converting you?
- Could you imagine?
No, I've seen these boys, they're wound
way too tight for that.
I bet he can't do it.
- Oh, wait. Are we betting here?
- Same as always, five and a sixer?
Oh no, this is big. Twenty bucks says he can't.
We're going high stakes? Fifty says he can't.
- I've seen the guys on the bikes. I'm thinking
this time you have met your match.
- Really?
Bullshit. Fifty says he can. And I bust
tables for a week.
- Fifty, two weeks, can't.
- Okay, I'm in with Andrew, no way.
Oh, cool. We on?
Alright, so what are we talking about here?
I get him to what?
- Do anything? Blowjob or ...?
- We need proof.
- Okay, underwear.
I knew this other Mormon guy in the army.
They got these sacred boxers, they shimmer.
- Get one of those.
- Sacred undies? Get outta here!  I gotta
see this. All right, I'm in.
I'll get one of those boys out
of their underwear.
Seal the deal.
Alright, we're going out tonight?
Oh please, not another episode
of 'Christian Hooks Up'!
- Hey, gotta keep my skills honed.
- To skills.
- Hey, leaving?
- Yeah, yoga. You?
Mmm, arm day...
Hey, you know, I don't think
we've met. I’m Julie Taylor.
- Hi. I'm Elder Davis.
- So, what you reading there?
I'm just studying. You know,
I thought I'd come outside.
'Cos, I'm from Idaho; it gets cold in October.
Oh, wow, bummer. It's pretty much
like this all the time here.
- Isn't it, Chris?
- Yeah.
- So, what is it that you guys do?
- We talk to people about our church.
Oh really? Chris likes to talk to people.
Sometimes it helps people to find
meaning in their lives.
Julie was complaining her
life is void of meaning.
- Void? I said 'void'?
- Maybe we can come talk to you.
- You know, we would like that.
- Sure. Okay.
Bye.
Subtle...
Yeah, I got fifty ridin' on you.
See you at work.
Thank God she's leaving.
Can you believe 'Entertainment Weekly'
called her
the ‘new sweetheart of American cinema’?
That cunt? She made Julie take my table,
because she thought I
hadn't bathed recently. Like she should talk!
Did you see her eat?
Yeah, did you check out her legs? Now
I know why they call ‘em calves.
I bet after sex, she smokes a ham!
Darling, give me a glass of Cuvee.
I do hope we're not speaking disparagingly
about our clientele.
Gossip is so ignoble.
Especially regarding those less fortunate.
Less fortunate? That bitch?!
You know something? ... tell!
No, I would never tell tales, such as
with the frequency she does it,
the poor child must think that binging and
purging are aerobic exercises.
She hardly looks bulimic.
Yes, if I were a different sort, I'd suggest
a little more of the purging, a little
less of the binging.
But I would never say such things.
For gossip is the lowest
form of discourse.
You should avoid it if at all possible.
Hear, hear. I shall be in the office, cooking
the books, if anyone needs me.
Oh, and Ben called. He seemed
kind of insistent.
Do you suppose Lila is hiding a
boyfriend from us?
Fucking skank... that's not a tip,
that's an indictment.
Take it sound, J.! Christ, who pissed
in your Cheerios?
Some A and R guy. She has drinks with
this guy so he'll listen to her demo,
and now she fears for her virtue.
- Hey!
- He's totally cute.
- I bust my ass making a great demo,
I can't get anyone to listen to it till this guy,
who obviously just wanted to fuck me.
Poor baby. I thought he was cute.
What, you would have sex to help your career?
Honey, I've blown a guy just to get
him out of my apartment!
Sex for my career would be noble.
Ben, I'm not ready to make that
kind of decision yet.
I have to go. Okay, I'll call.
- Here's Andrew's wine order.
- Thank you.
- Is there something else?
- Everyone thinks Ben is your
boyfriend, but he's not, he's a doctor, isn't he?
- Is everything okay?
- Young man, I will not
be the subject of gossip in
my own establishment.
Sorry.
And that's how, through Joseph Smith,
God restored the true church of
Jesus Christ to the earth.
Got any questions?
How come if God talks to Joseph Smith,
he's a prophet,
but if God talks to me, I'm schizophrenic?
Ah, well, he was sort of special.
What's the Mormon church's stand
on black people?
That's a good question. African-
American members
have been allowed to hold the
priesthood since 1978.
Since disco. And women?
Women don't get to hold the
priesthood, what they get
is to be wives and to be mothers
and share in its blessings.
- Oh, sharing. See, sharing is good.
- Christian here was wondering
what is your church's stand on gay rights.
- Um well...
- There's no such thing.
'Gay' and 'right' don't belong in
the same sentence.
Oh, but 'right' and 'rightwing' go hand-in-hand?
Yeah, God hates homos.
You're gonna come into my house and
tell me God hates homosexuals?
And the French!
- God hates the French?
- Everybody hates the French.
Just push the orange button. Oh,
you are such a sweetheart
for doing that, thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Ma, you're flashing the whole terminal.
- I can't help it.
If I don't they are gonna end up
around my knees.
Oh, I'm losing the only other
sane one around here.
I think this belong to you now, son.
Do us proud.
Yes sir, I will.
Now, you have yourself a real safe trip, okay?
Oh, for crying out loud, I wasn't gonna do this.
Ma, you promised. If you start, I will.
I know, but I can't help it, because
you're my baby, you know.
And you always will be.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Look, if there's a problem, I could come back.
Look, maybe I'm just homesick.
Homesick? For Idaho?
- Okay, fine...
- I'm sorry. That came out wrong.
It's just... When I left home... I zoomed
like a rocket here.
But if you've never been away from
home before... Have you?
What? I've been away from home.
Just not for two whole years.
Could be worse, could be raining.
- That's 'Young Frankenstein'.
- Yeah.
- So two years, huh?
- Yeah.
We're not allowed to call or
go home in the holidays,
and they're not allowed to visit.
- Wow, where do I sign up?
- Hey, I happen to like my family.
After all, a boy's best friend is his mother.
'Psycho'! That's 'Psycho', right?
She goes a bit mad sometimes...
We all go a bit mad sometimes.
At least you got your friends here, right?
What, Ryder? No, we just got assigned to
to each other a few weeks ago.
Oh!
Well, better you than me.
Kind of a funny coincidence, all you
guys being named Elmer, huh?
Elmer?!
- You think I'm an Elmer?
- Well, you're not?
No, doofus! It's Elder. It's a title. Elder...
Oh, that's a good thing. Somebody
naming you Elmer,
it's just mean. What's your first name, then?
- We're not allowed to use them.
- What? Why not?
We're not allowed to do a lot of things.
- It's Aaron.
- Aaron. I like that.
You're gonna sort through those, right?
- Colors and whites don't mix, Aaron.
- Okay, thanks.
Oh wait, you've never done your
laundry before either, have you?
Well, maybe I've just never done everybody's.
That's what I have to do, 'cos I'm a
greeny. The new guy, you know.
So I have to do everyone's laundry, in
accordance with prophecy.
Really.
Sike! Dude, you're way too easy.
That's what I've heard.
Well, thanks for the laundry tips.
Geez, Elder.
You're a thousand miles away over here.
- How you doing, Green?
- Good.
- Yeah, you sure?
- Yeah.
You know, when I was a Green,
it was really tough.
I used to pray that I would die during the night
so I wouldn't have to wake up
to another day of this.
You're joking me, right?
I couldn't take going back to
the family, you know,
Salt Lake and all. I had two of the
general authorities
at my missionary farewell.
You know what's that like,
your dad is a stake president, right?
They set this thing up to be difficult, okay?
We can't listen to music, we can't
watch movies,
we're never supposed to be alone.
I mean, what, we're 19, 20 years old,
and we're not even allowed to beat off.
Some nights I wake up and I find
teeth marks on my head board.
Look, I put my time in here so that
I can go home,
so I can marry Jennifer, so that
I can finally nail her.
See? It's amazing what we'll do for sex.
- I know you did!
- I did not, I promise you.
- Yes you did!
- I cross my heart.
Oh, that means something.
- Hey, we'd like to play here.
- Yeah, we're playing here.
- You're just farting around.
- How vivid. We're playing, see?
- Bounce the ball, bounce the ball.
- No, you're just jerking us around.
There's one afternoon a week
where I can just be normal
and play some hoop, and you have to
come and get all ignorant about it?
Oh, listen to that, Julie. I didn't
think Mormons liked whine?
- I didn't know fairies liked sports.
- Fairies? Oh, how seventh grade.
- Why don't we just play two on two?
- But you're...
- A girl, so I can't play?
But then I am black, so maybe I can.
Your only problem is deciding
which one of your
narrow-minded stereotypes can
kick your lily-white ass.
- Afraid you'll get beat?
- By a girl... and a fag?
We'll mop you like a dirty floor.
Fine. We're shirts, you're skins.
Uh... no...
Fine, we'll be skins.
That's unfair put your shirts back on,
we can keep the teams straight.
- You can play?
- Yeah, we can learn a skill.
I played in high school, when I learned
all the jocks were doing it
but only with other jocks.
Maybe we should cut the chatter.
Okay slackers, how's the studying coming?
Ryder? Right.
All right, First Corinthians 7,1. Ryder? Right. Anybody? Gil.
Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved,
let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness
of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God.
Well, alright Green! You know,
if Gilford wouldn't be
completely heartbroken, you would
be my new best friend.
- Yeah, Harmon, I got your heartbreak right here.
- Oh, man!
Elder, you got the devil in you!
Hey.
Oh, shit. Jesus Christ! Sorry, I snagged myself.
Looks like you're bleeding.
You okay?
No, I'm fine. Just go back to your reading.
- What?
- I think you... fainted.
I don't bleed very well.
- I'm okay, really.
- No, maybe we should get you inside.
Ryder! Wanna give me a hand?
Damn Ryder, I'm gonna hit you
and it's gonna hurt.
- That hurt!
- I warned you.
- Alright.
- No, Aaron, come on. Do me a favor.
You've got to take a look at it...
tell me if I need stitches or something.
I can't really tell.
Look! Come on I'm not going to lunge
at you just take a look at it.
Let's see here...
- Is it bad?
- No, it's just a little cut.
- Do you have any disinfectant?
- Yeah.
It's funny, you know. I'm not squeamish.
In high school, we went to this hospital,
but I was the only one who wanted to
watch surgery. They brought me in and
they scrubbed me down, and they put me
in these green things, you know?
Band-Aids? I watched as they
opened this guy's chest
and there it was, this heart, this human heart.
You think about it beating and all but it's
it's more of a dance.
And I couldn't get over it, that's all
that tethers us to this planet, you know that
fragile little muscle
and it's tiny you know, in
the scheme of things...
if you think about all the things that can stop it
there's got to be something else,
some miraculous thing that keeps that
valiant little muscle dancing,
you know what I mean?
I'm sorry... I'm gonna stop talking.
I need to lay down now.
It's hot.
I'm hot.
- Maybe I should get you a cool cloth?
- Yeah...
I haven't done anything...
anything like this... I haven't...
It's okay... this doesn't have
to mean anything...
Yes it does!
It can be just a little fun... between friends.
My first time could just be a little fun for you?
Maybe you can equate sex with a handshake.
That's what... like a badge?!
What, do you want me to congratulate you?
Hey... don't preach to me, okay?
I mean who are you, some kid from the sticks?
You come in here and fucking judge me?
Yeah... I am some doodah
pudnacker from Pocatello...
they ship us here from Dork Island.
I'm saying I know how retarded
you think I am, okay?
You found me out, alright?
My worst secret.
Now I'm humiliated, so your work is done here.
Wait... I don't think you are a dork,
but if you know how ridiculous you
look, why would you do it?
Don't you believe in anything?
- Yeah...
- Then tell me...
... tell me one thing in your life beyond a
shadow of a doubt that you believe.
I believe Ann-Margret has never been
given her due as an actress.
Duh! For 'Tommy' alone, I mean, did you
see her when she was...
Is that something you can build a life on?
Look at yourself!
You're so pretty and colourful on the outside...
but on the inside you're nothing but fluff.
You're like a walking... talking...
marshmallow peep.
That's not fair.
It doesn't matter when it's true.
I can't believe what I was about to do
when there is nothing, Christian, nothing
about you that's not skin deep.
Do you believe in God?
- What, who are you talking to?
- You.
No, everybody... alright, general question:
Do you believe in God?
You mean other than Madonna?
Fucking A yeah, I do... why not?
I believe in harmony as a law in
the universe like gravity,
you know we're meant to vibrate together.
Well, being positive since I was 17 gives
meaning to the word 'miracle',
so yeah. I mean without getting all holy
on your ass, I believe... what?
The Mormons are mind-fucking him.
Oh honey, you do not want to let
them get into your psyche.
You start off listening to Amy Grant
but then before you know it...
it's 3 a.m. and you got your Visa card
and you're giving it
to the scary bitch on TV with the lavender hair.
- You'd better testify!
I mean, hello Chris we have a bet going here.
It's you convert one of them, remember?
Did you forget who you are talking to here?
I will bust everyone's tables if I lose this,
but let me just say...
- No no, let me say...
I dated this guy once... actor, cute,
southern, came from this real religious family...
well, his parents found out he was gay,
and can you say drama?
They sent him to one of those
Christian change ministries.
- Wow, did he change?
- Did he!
Miss Thing used to be a top.
I'm serious. He's still gayer
than a box of birds.
A box of birds... I love that!
How about twirlier than a party dress ,
but seriously, it fucked with him.
Well, I'm not being fucked with.
It's just... I'm not shallow, am I?
Honey, you don't have to be deep, you...,
you just have to be pretty.
Okay, you're not helping.
If you have something to prove, be at my
house at 6:30 in the morning.
6:30 in the morning... why?
You have to sacrifice if you
want to find yourself,
or whatever it is you're doing.
You don't think I'll be there?
Quit bitching! It's the early bird
who gets the worm.
There's an incentive... especially when
you can get pizza till 2 a.m.
Okay, here's the deal:
After your training I'm going to set you up
on a route
A route! On my first day?
It's what you do already, it's delivering
food, only this time you're
driving;, think as yourself as a waiter on wheels.
Great, give me some hot pants
and roller skates,
this will be the fulfillment of a dream.
For all of us...
Hi, we're from...
Hi! We're from the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day...
Hi! We're from the Church of Jesus Christ...
Just a moment.
Honey? Stacey, you'll wanna hear this...
What have we here?
Hello?
Hello, Project Angel food, hello?
I said 'come in' three goddamn times.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
Where do you want me to put this?
I don't care, I'm not hungry.
- Okay, well maybe I can just  turn a light on in here...
- Jesus, prick!
You're not gonna last long if you look that
shocked with everybody.
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna put
this down over here.
So... you got a cigarette?
Isn't that an oxygen tank?
Couldn't that uh... explode?
Boom.
That'd be such a terrible
way to go, wouldn’t it?
So come on, how about that cigarette?
Sorry, I don't smoke.
What are you doing here?
I'm delivering your food, I thought
we'd been through the routine.
No, no, I mean you.
Pretty boys don't usually do shit like this.
Are you punishing yourself, or something?
Feel... guilty for being so good-looking...
when there are so many ugly
fucks in the world?
You get tired of doing reps at the gym?
And bragging about your latest conquests
and all the rest of your stupid shallow little life?
Fuck you. You don't know me.
Of course I do. I used to be you. Yeah...
I had a career... friends... looks, the whole package...
but now I am just a skeletal reminder
that we might only be
in the eye of the hurricane.
Okay, I'm gonna go now.
I'm just fucking with you right?
You should have seen your face.
I get bored, I'm sorry... I like
to rattle the newbies.
I must really look like shit; it
didn't use to be this easy.
Could you just help me with this pillow
under me I don't... I dunno, I can't...
anyway sort of... Christ, my butt
has wasted away to nothing
it's too bad cause I used to
have a killer ass, I did.
I've got pictures of it around here somewhere.
- I'll take your word for it.
- That's good.
Snow! It's all just snow!
What did you just say?
Maybe it's the meds but...
Sometimes I get this weird read on people.
You're like a blank TV screen.
All I see is snow.
What do you suppose that means?
Nothing.
I'll see you.
No, you won't.
We should go in.
Ah for the love of flippin' Pete,
we're not tracking a hospital.
That's sick, and not in a good way.
Let's just see if they let us leave some
pamphlets in the lobby.
Hey you're dancing solo, cowboy!
They only allow non-denominational
literature in the lobby
What did I flippin' tell ya!
Ma'am, you okay?
Is there anything I can do?
I... I'm sorry.
I don't do this.
I refuse to break down in front of strangers.
But someone dies...
I'm so sorry.
They shouldn't have made me do it.
Turn it off... like...
watching a line on a little screen just... go.
Straight.
He always said that television
would be the death of him.
Was he your husband?
No... never my official husband...
then again...
probably my best friend.
His doctor Ben called me and
said that it was time.
This is what he wanted.
I should have been prepared for it.
Who are you?
Cary Grant?
No ma'am. I'm a Mormon missionary.
We just pass out pamphlets.
And they give us these discussions
that we memorize.
I really don't know what to say here.
Do you ever read the Sunday Comics?
I beg your pardon?
The comic page.
When I was a little kid I used to put
my face right up to them, you know
and I was just amazed because it
was just this mass of dots.
I think life is like that sometimes
but I like to think that from God's perspective,
life... everything... even this...
makes sense.
It's not just dots.
Instead we're all... we're all connected.
And it's beautiful.
And it's funny.
And it's good.
From this close we can't
expect it to make sense
right now.
- Thank you.
- Oh keep it.
Would you come and see me? Please?
Drinks are on the house.
Oh, um, I don't drink.
That must make your church
a bit of a hard sell.
At times, yeah.
Well, just hang on to it anyway.
Maybe you can come by for a meal... on me?
I will.
Promise?
I promise.
So, did you have fun? Talking to crying lady?
Yeah, I did actually.
Good. So we missed lunch!
I've seen you guys going out early
in the morning
I bet you are wondering where
I am off to, huh?
You're always at the gym.
No, I am volunteering now. Project Angel food.
That's great.
What do you want from me,
some sort of merit badge?
No... I just... you know what you
said about me, it's not true.
Fine! It's not true and the world's
a better place.
You're not doing that cause of
what I said, are you?
- No, I just thought we could...
- You thought we could what?
Hang out? Be best friends?
Ride off into the sunset?
I don't know.
Everyone seems to think that...
they treat me like I'm...
...like you're perfect.
Yeah... maybe sometimes.
And you are the first person
I've met that's made me feel
like that's not enough, like maybe
I want to be something more.
- So I just thought...
- Look... whatever you thought...
Don't.
We're colors and whites...
...we don't mix.
Oh, fuck... I gotta piss!
Hallway, first door on your right.
I don't kiss.
Mmm.
What's your name again?
Dick?
Dirk.
Dirk? Your parents named you Dirk?
It's really Mort.
My friends call me ‘Water sports Mort’.
It's not that I don't appreciate what
you're doing back there but...
Could we have a little talk?
Talk?
Cool!
I'm into that.
Fuck yeah... I am your nasty little slut boy.
I'm your pussy whore.
You're gonna spank momma's ass
cause she's been a bad, bad girl!
Oh, okay that's not exactly what I meant.
I meant conversation.
Conversation?
Why?
Don't you ever want to get to know someone?
Have it... mean something, sleep with
someone and actually sleep with them.
You wanna what... sleep together?
I don't know man...isn't that kind of intimate?
Excuse me, a moment ago you
were licking my spleen,
but sleeping with you would be too intimate?
Whoa... now you're freaking me out.
I didn't know you were into weird shit.
I'm just gonna go, man.
- It's back...
- Yeah!
It must be your lucky fucking day.
Or maybe I'm not suffering enough yet.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Oh come on now! You don't
think you going all Miss Cleo
on me is going to scare me off
that easily now, do you?
Maybe it's just dementia setting in.
Sometime I read people and I... I think
I'm the oracle at Delphi
Well, sometimes I growl at people;
doesn't make me Eartha Kitt.
- I'm going to put this right about here.
- Doesn't matter, I'm still not hungry.
I don't remember asking if you were.
I just deliver the stuff, remember?
But my friend Andrew made this
and he doesn't even cook for his
boyfriend, so the least you can
do is try and be polite.
And eat it.
I don't have to pretend to be polite.
I think I've earned that right.
Oh yes, that's right... you're dying, you're
bitter... blah, blah, blah.
Fortunately, I'm shallow so
I'm impervious to that.
Now eat it.
Impervious...
I bet you don't know how to spell that.
Sure I do... it's spelled 'Bite me'.
Now just to show that our little problems
in this world don't amount to a hill of beans,
I'm going to read about some people
who have some real trouble! Oh, no!
Say it isn't so!
What?
Well, apparently poor Pam Anderson has had
her breast implants taken out
and put back in so many times her
entire chest is collapsing.
Oh, they have bikini pictures.
- They're horrible!
- Shut up.
No, they are, seriously, they're down to
her knees.
Eat your chicken and I'll show you.
Prick.
Give me the fucking magazine.
Aaron, what happened!
- There was an accident. Come on,
let me help you inside.
There was this car that was just
going way too fast...
I just got a couple scrapes...
Ryder, I should have warned him, now they've
taken him to the hospital...
Accidents... they happen.
I was thinking... I wasn't even paying attention.
It's okay...
Look...
you're in no position, I should...
...go...
Ah for flippin... Gross!
Pretty boy's not the only fag here!
Okay, look, nothing happened here guys.
We walked in here and you two were
mackin' like
schoolgirls and you're saying
nothing happened?
Well, maybe you can try and
reach down in your little
bible geek soul and be cool for two seconds?
I don't think you get to be making
requests here, gay boy.
Don't fucking touch me, asshole!
Dude, you so got to be leaving.
Don't blow this out of proportion, it's
not that big of a deal, right?
Yeah, it kinda is.
Please, just go.
- Um... hi. Is Davis around?
- You're too late, lover boy...
You'd better betcha they're putting your
boyfriend's butt on a plane
home this afternoon.
And now we have to move again cause
we can't live across from some
big doodah flamer homo,
thank you very much.
You stay! Your friend and I
are gonna have a little talk.
Okay asshole, the way I see it you've got a big
mouth and only one arm to back it up,
so how is it going to look when a big
flamer kicks the shit out of you?
Ryder... tell me where he is!
What, do you think I wanted
to see him get busted?
This may come as a surprise to you,
but I actually liked the guy.
He took this whole thing serious as a seizure.
But we were getting through it, okay.
So why him? Huh?
Why'd you go fuck him up?
He doesn't deserve the kind of grief he's got
coming down the pipe.
Nothing was supposed to happen to him.
Oh pucky! You were gunning for
something ever since we got here,
and if you want to know where
he is, I want to know why.
It was just stupid... it was just a
dumb bet, 50 bucks.
But it's not about that.
It's not about that at all.
Please. Ryder please...
You're too late anyway; his
flight left 10 minutes ago.
Hey... if it's any help... there's a
5-hour lay-over in Salt Lake.
Thanks!
Aaron!
Sorry.
God, I hate the snow.
What are you doing here?
I came after you.
How could you leave without saying anything?
It's not my choice.
I'm being sent home in shame.
And I'm probably going to be excommunicated.
For just a kiss?
Don't get me wrong it was a nice kiss but
hey, come on, we didn't even
get to use our tongues!
You wouldn't understand.
I'm sorry. I'm not... I'm not very good at this.
See, I've never made a fool out of
myself in front of anyone before.
But I've never felt this way before about
anyone in my entire life.
What, for just some guy you can't have?
And then next week you're gonna be
on to your next conquest...
But what if you're not?
Huh? What if everything in my entire
pathetic life, which I happen to love,
has led me to this point, right now?
What if, what if you're the blinding
light in the middle of the road
that strikes me like the guy in...
- in the Bible.
- Him!
- Paul?
- Yeah!
And what if everything's changed like that...
And lions lay down with lambs,
and colors mix with whites?
What if you're the one I have been
waiting for my whole life,
and I let you go?
You have no idea what I'd be giving up.
Dammit... what's wrong with you?
You want 'Revelations' engraved in gold, and
angels trumpeting down from heaven.
What if this is it instead,
me telling you I love you, right
here ... in the snow?
I think that's pretty miraculous.
But if you don't... I'll go. You can pretend that
this was just some coincidence.
You can pretend there wasn't some
reason that we met.
That you're sorry I ever walked into your life.
God I hate the snow.
Oh... door must have froze shut. You boys
come in before you freeze too.
C'mon, we're closing the whole
airport because of this storm.
Wow.
How long did we go at it?
Two and a half hours.
It's okay, right?
Okay?
That's amazing.
I don't even know how long you're
supposed to do it.
- You carry a pocket watch!
- Yeah, it's done months...
It was actually my great grandfather's, but...
I don't think you came here for a
genealogy lesson.
You know, I thought you'd be
a little more reticent.
Well... I'm already going to
hell for kissing you so...
I may as well take the scenic route.
What God do you believe in?
It's not just God.
It's everything.
This... you... tonight...
I'm just... turning my back on it all.
But you know I guess... a guy
like you really doesn't
know what that's like, you know...
to be completely cut off.
When I was 13 years old, my dad...
he was this macho, hot shot, banker guy,
and I was just this skinny little kid
who'd been caught trying on his
mother's shoes one too many times...
Anyway, my dad said he would rather
die than raise a little nelly-boy,
and I thought I would rather die than be one.
So my dad, who'd never been out
of the city in his entire life,
decided we're going to go hunt deer.
So my dad drags me to this lodge
up in the Sierras, right...
It's early November,
the same as now,
and there is this storm rolling in.
My dad was so determined that sissy
boy was going to kill something.
Snow came at us from all sides.
The air, the sky, the ground,
they all became the same,
and horrible screaming white,
and I thought 'we're gonna be okay, right?'
And then I saw my father's eyes,
and they were that same white...
and that's when he did it.
He did what?
Ran.
He didn't come back for you?
No.
But I got calm... I knew I was going to die,
and that's when I heard it:
an angel...
singing.
An angel?
Turned out not to be an angel at all.
What was it?
Just the wind... over some rocks.
A cave.
Inside, at least I was out of the
snow, and I guess I drifted off.
When I woke up it was dark.
It was still snowing hard. I heard a noise
at the mouth of the cave, like a bear...
and it grabbed me, and picked me up and
I fought, but I was so weak and cold...
all I could do was knock the bear's hood off.
The bear had a hood?
Turned out to be a bear only in the sense
of the search and rescue guy was pretty hairy.
That's when it got weird.
And not until then?
He ripped off all my clothes
and he tore all his clothes off.
Sure you weren't delirious?
Then he stuffed us into a sleeping bag
Oh wait, hypothermia, I remember
from the boy scout manual.
Exactly, but I didn't know what to think.
I was so... tired.
And cold.
In spite of it all...
I popped the biggest woody ever.
And he wrapped those big arms around me,
pulled me into that hairy chest,
and told me I was okay.
That was the first moment in that
whole ordeal I began to cry.
I don't blame you; I would have
been freaked out too.
No...
it was joy.
I thought I'd rather die than be gay.
I got a pretty good idea what dying felt like.
But lying there in the arms of that man...
I thought if this is what being gay feels like...
bring it on.
Come on... let's get you home.
Hello?
Oh that's very funny. Fuck you Andrew.
Well, where the hell have you been?
Salt Lake.
Okay, if you hauled your ass all that way, you
better tell me you won the bet.
I think I'm the loser on this one, Jules...
Hey hey... don't let it get to you... even
Tiger Woods slices now and then.
Fucking Andrew!
Is he doing his crackhead telemarketer again?
No he is jerking me around by...
On the off chance... you didn't happen to give
my demo out to anyone, did you?
Um... yeah... this Angel Food guy I deliver to.
He said he was once in the music
business but...
you know, I thought he might like it.
I think he gave it away.
To?
Oh, Julie, I dunno, I mean he's on
heavy meds, and he's loopy anyway.
You can't take what he says seriously...
Julie, you're hurting my arm!
Who'd he give it to? Well who...
He said he was gonna give it to Clive...
Davis?
Clive Davis!
Oh fuck me, I hung up on Clive Davis?
Oh my God, answer it!
- No you answer it...
- Answer it!
- Ow! Julie that's the arm that I use to..
- Fucking answer it!
Hello?
Julie Taylor?
Um... so is that Clyde with a D,
or Clive with a V?
Oh well, it's official...
winter's here.
Bundle up.
Ah... much better.
So... guess what... this A and R guy
from the record company
who's been totally coy about
which team he plays on...
why don't I introduce you,
you can totally nail him
and set the record straight,
well... so to speak.
- I think I'll pass on this one.
- Get out. Why? He's totally cute, I'm serious.
What's wrong with you? You know, you
haven't been yourself since...
wait, are you still not over missionary man?
I don't know.
Chris...
It's weird with him disappearing like that.
Okay, well then just stop moping like a schoolgirl
and do something about it, call him!
Just dial 1-800-TORTURED MORMON?
Probably, sounds like there
are enough of them.
But I think that you should
just get the hell over it.
Maybe I don't want to.
I mean, L.A. is a city where everyone
dances with one eye on the door...
like we're all waiting for something
better to walk in.
But would we even recognize it if it did?
It might be nice to stop circling.
It might be nice to stop equating
sex with a handshake.
And it would be nice to have
it mean something.
Listen to you, you are turning into a chick.
- Shut up!
- You are!
Wait, Christian wait, seriously you
dropped something.
What?
Your balls! Must have fallen off
around here somewhere.
This is me not talking to you.
Okay wait, but you're still coming
to the show tonight, right?
As president of the Pocatello stake,
it is my unhappy duty
and obligation to convene this church court on
behalf of the Elder
Aaron Davis for the grave and
grievous sin of homosexuality.
When you were just a child of 8,
You were taught you
are not to deviate
Only one way to heaven but
half a million ways to fall
In the light of your abnormal
and abominable state
and your refusal to see you have been duped
into a hogwash alternative lifestyle...
I wish my shame was enough for both of us,
not to mention the shame
you brought to this church...
- Our family... our ancestors...
- Wait a minute, our ancestors?
Dad... your grandfather had half a dozen wives.
Same goes for every single
person in this room...
I'd say we were the original definition
of alternative lifestyle.
Are you calling us hypocrites?
No, we've gone way beyond hypocrisy,
Dad, now we're just being mean.
And it's another beautiful day.
It's another beautiful day.
It's another beautiful day
in the land of the free
With the authority invested in me by the
Melchizedek priesthood,
and in the name of Jesus Christ,
I have no choice
but to begin excommunication
proceedings against you
at which point you will be
stripped of the priesthood...
the garments... and membership in this church.
It's another beautiful day.
It's another beautiful day.
It's another beautiful day
in the land of the free
It's another beautiful day.
It's another beautiful day.
It's another beautiful day
in the land of the free.
Still at it?
There are a lot of Davises out there.
Hi, I'm trying to reach an Aaron Davis.
No, not Errol... AARON... two A's...
Hi, yeah I'm looking for Aaron Davis...
No, he didn't win anything...
No no, no, he is younger than that...
Does he have a son named Aaron?
No! Yeah! Let me talk to your wife.
Hi, hello I'm looking for an Aaron Davis.
What? The Davis boy, yeah,
that sounds like him.
No, he's not in any more trouble...
What kind of trouble?
I'm sorry... I'm not trying to pry.
Ferron Davis... can you spell that?
On Stone Creek... really... Thank you so much.
Buck Owens... really... they still run that?
Okay, well you get back to it now.
Okay, thank you.
Hello? I'm sorry, brother Davis
is down at the stake centre.
Oh, I'm sorry... Aaron? May I ask why
you are trying to reach Aaron?
Los Ang... are you one of the
Elders in Los Angeles?
No... you know what, my son has
no desire to speak to you,
and I hope you could have the decency
not to call here again.
Is Dad missing dinner again?
Oh, it's nothing, but he sure is late
over at the stake centre.
There is no point in this getting cold.
If you're just gonna play with it...
I don't know why I bother anymore.
Julie! Get out here... I found him.
- You talked to him?
- No, his mother hung up on me.
Um... bitch!
No, but if he really did not want to talk
to me, then she really would not
have had a problem putting
him on the phone, right?
And next time he will probably pick up.
Damn girl! Who knew getting hung up on
would make me feel so good!
Good! Then we're going out because you've
been a contrary Mary too long!
Something fall again?
Yeah, just a little dropsy... you go on.
- Mom?
- Hmm?
- Mom...
- What, Aaron?
What?
It's nothing I just wanted to see if you
could bring yourself to look at me.
I'm looking at you... what am
I supposed to be seeing?
Nothing.
His name was Christian, wasn't it?
What?
Is Christian the one?
What did he do to you!
He loved me.
Don't say that! Do you know
how ridiculous that sounds?
How repulsive that is to God, to everyone?
Two men? Men don't love Aary...
women bring love to a relationship.
- But Ma, he told me he loved me...
- He would have told you anything.
He flattered and beguiled you... tools
of the devil, that's what they do.
- You don't know that.
- Yes I do.
- You don't know that.
- I do... you know why?
Because when you didn't arrive home...
- I called your mission president.
- You checked up on me, huh?
I was worried sick about you,
and you know what he said?
Your missionary companion told him
that that Christian person...
you were nothing more than a bet he made.
- That's not true...
- Yes, it is true...
He won your soul for a lousy fifty dollars.
That's all you were worth to him,
and you know what?
He's probably forgotten all about you,
and now he's moving on
to his next fornication.
- Mom he wouldn't...
- It meant nothing to him.
He was using you and that is why...
you can never think about him again, ever...
ever again.
You got... you have got to put this thing
behind you.
This horrible mistake that
everybody knows about...
You've seen how they look at us.
You've seen how people just turn their
carts around...
when we walk down the aisle in the market...
and how they look away at the bank.
Why do you think your father
doesn't come home anymore?
What if it is not something I've done,
what if it's who I am?
Don't say that. Don't you ever even think that!
You can be forgiven... maybe heavenly Father can forgive
you for what you've done, but who you are...
He could never forgive something like that.
You know... I think I am going to heat up
that casserole with the cream of
mushroom soup.
Where are you going?
- I left some stuff down the church...
- Now? We just got back!
Our son... we've just come back from...
As good a time as any.
Hello? Mrs. Davis... listen, I know you don't
want me to speak with your son.
My son? Let me tell you something,
you son of a bitch...
Thanks to you, my son took
a razor to his wrists.
Thanks to you, I have lost my son.
And I hope you burn, I hope you burn forever!
Chris?
Sit down.
Drink that.
Toss it.
That way, it's medicinal.
Good, it's vital for a man to have a couple of
slugs in him before discussing heart ache.
- I think Hemingway told me that...
- You knew Ernest Hemingway?
Margot actually.
But beauties don't always escape tragedy.
Oh God, this is hell...
I've done something.
I'm guilty...
and I'll burn for it.
Funny thing about guilt... there's
nothing so bad that
you can't add a little guilt to it
and make it worse.
And there's nothing so good you
can't add a little guilt to it
and make it better.
Guilt distracts us from a greater truth...
we have an inherent ability to heal.
We seem intent on living through
even the worst heartbreak.
How?
Practice.
3 a.m... you slut.
I wish. We were in the studio; I can't seem to
come up with a song for the single.
- You?
- Couldn't sleep.
So what... you sit here in the dark?
Hey. Let's just say 'fuck the no-carbs thing'...
and let's go to Dupar's and eat
pancakes till we choke, huh?
Nah... I think I'm just going to go back to bed.
Tuesday, 3 a.m., once again I can't sleep.
It's like I'm waiting for time to fix some
part of me that keeps on breaking.
I've already thrown out the newspaper
and washed the leftover dishes.
Nothing to do but sit here and think.
As a citizen and voter in the city of
Los Angeles,it is up to you to decide
if you will allow...
Where are you going with my
goddamn flowers?
But they are...
We don't throw anything out
that's not completely dead.
- Deal?
- Deal.
And another thing... you've got
to quit coming over here
and moping around, you're
fucking depressing me.
I'm depressing you?
That's what I'm saying... If we've reached the
point where you're dragging
my day, well then...
we got a problem... seriously.
You got to do something... it's
time to make a move.
Find a way to get past this.
Are you being the oracle right now?
Nah... I'm just being a friend.
- Hello may I help you?
- Are you Aaron Davis' mother?
I'm sister Davis, yes.
I knew your son, in Los Angeles.
Oh, you must be one of the elders
from there, you have that look.
No, my name is Christian.
He lost his watch.
I wanted you to know how sorry I am.
It kills me to think that I could
have caused him any pain.
Wait!
Could be worse... could be raining.
Oh yeah... it is raining.
Only in LA it does rain make the news
as ‘Operation Storm Watch’!
Don't suppose there's bills
of mine in that mail?
Oh my God... it's a copy of my video.
What?
Get outta here... it's about damn time.
Been waiting to see this.
Come on girl it's been so top secret.
Plug it in, let’s go!
Okay, I don't want you to
snap to some judgment...
Why? It's some kind of like
nasty-ass Christina Aguilera
skank-o-rama kind of video?
No, it's just...
Tuesday, 3 a.m.,
once again I'm wide awake
waiting for time to mend this part of me
that keeps on breaking.
Newspapers I threw away,
washed the dishes in the sink
What the fuck...
That's from my journal; what the fuck is
stuff from my journal doing in here?
You were the one always telling
me to write songs about you.
I was gonna tell you...
or ask you or whatever...
You knew I'd tell you to go fuck yourself.
So you what? You'd steal my
most private personal hell
I've been trying to get past,
and you turn around
and throw it back in my face, is that it?
I just thought that something
good could come out of this...
Oh, for you maybe...
Jesus, Chris... I didn't want to tell you...
look, I don't want to tell you like this,
but the record label, they...
want me to move to New York for a while,
cause... all the hot producers
work in the clubs there.
Have a nice trip.
Help you?
- I was looking for Christian.
- Yeah um... no Chris, he's um... he's not...
No, never mind.
Want me to give him a message or anything?
I heard you didn't get the part.
I hate to admit it, but I'm gonna miss
you when you go back to New York.
Who said anything about leaving?
Come on, you hate L.A.
Look, if you tell anybody that I said this,
I will rip your lips off.
I was miserable in New York.
At least in L.A. you can be miserable
while you get a tan.
My dear boy...
I was hoping this was still good.
Of course it's still good.
I didn't have any place else to go.
Welcome.
Give my young friend whatever he wants.
Just a coke, thank you.
Nothing stronger?
You look like you could use it.
If you don't mind me saying, you look like, um... Hell?
Why?
I didn't come to unload on you.
Well, you gave me that privilege once,
let me return the favor.
After we met, I was sent home
and excommunicated
for being gay.
Your church doesn't like
alcohol or homosexuals.
Well, I am definitely not joining.
Can't imagine heaven without both.
Sorry, go on.
That led me to a brief but disastrous
affair with a sharp object.
After the hospital stitched me up,
my parents put me in this place,
this facility where they were
supposed to change me,
and fix me.
This one night I was on restriction,
and I was cleaning this floor with a toothbrush,
that's when I heard it...
this voice...
it was like an angel.
But it was just the TV.
It was the strangest coincidence.
I don't believe in coincidence.
These days I believe in miracles.
Maybe.
Because the girl who was singing...
she's only almost famous,
you wouldn't know her.
But I did.
And I know people feel this way
about certain songs,
but I felt like she was singing right to me.
This is my young friend.
We've met.
- I went by your place...
- I sub-let it...
Is this...? This isn't...
He's a great tipper!
Darlings, the food's not gonna
get warmer sitting on the counter!
Hot stuff coming through!
A toast.
An affirmation.
A prayer of thanks.
I want you to know that wherever
we find ourselves in this world,
whatever our successes or failures,
come this time of year you will
always have a place at my table...
and a place in my heart.
- Cheers.
Sometimes it all still feels
like a mass of dots,
but
more and more these days,
I feel like we're all connected.
And it's beautiful,
and funny,
and good.
