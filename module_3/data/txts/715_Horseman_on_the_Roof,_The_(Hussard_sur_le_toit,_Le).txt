Shoot! Come on! Shoot 'em!
- Give it to me!
- We can't see!

I was right, you see.
Always get the sun in their eyes.
Remember that.
I promise. You look like an officer.
I'm a colonel!
A colonel!
There are colonels as young as you?
Yes, in Italy.
- Your horse is admirable.
- Glad you like him.
- What is his name?
- I don't know. I stole him.
For Italy, you go through Digne.
We part now.
I'm going by way of Sisteron.
To Sisteron?
- Where to then?
- Towards Gap.
- But that is so far.
- I'll be fine.
Don't worry.
I'm running late.
Thank you.
It was a blessing meeting you.
Without you,
who knows where I would be.
Good-bye!
Come! Quick!
- Looking for us?
- Could be.
We didn't go unnoticed.
Don't take the valley.
You'd be arrested.
Go by the mountains.
I don't know the way.
- I will go with you.
- But it's out of your way.
I'll cross the Alps to Italy.
- A detour.
- I don't care.
No, I won't let you change
your plans for me anymore.
I can travel alone.
No.
You think I'm not able to?
I will not leave a woman in all this.
If I forbid you to follow?
I would anyhow.
It is my duty to help you.
That is how I was raised.
Tell me where you are going.
To Théus.
- Where is that?
- Near Gap.
Let's go.
I'd hate being your soldier.
So would I.
Here, too, everybody is gone.
The barn.
There'll be hay there. You can rest.
I'm fine. I can go on.
In an hour it will be too dark.
Run!
You are not sleeping?
No, I can't.
No fire, really?
- Are you cold?
- A bit.
Who'd see us?
We're far from everything.
We're not,
and I know those soldiers.
Tonight, there'll be many scouts out.
I'll make a fire at daybreak.
You're so organized.
Are you from a military family?
- I think so.
- What do you mean?
I never knew my father.
He came to Italy with Napoleon,
then he left.
He may be dead or alive.
Nobody knows.
- Put these on.
- I have some.
- You must keep your legs warm.
- Wool stockings!
Do as I say.
This place is no better.
But the roadblocks?
Cholera doesn't stop for soldiers.
I am sorry.
Is all that money yours?
It's in my care.
To carry to Italy?
You came to France to hide?
Where were you?
In Aix.
Aix.
I spent three months there last year.
Were you there then?
We could've met.
- Did you go out a lot?
- Never.
Of course.
I love Aix.
I have many friends there.
Where are they today?
On the road like us,
or locked in their houses,
afraid to breathe?
I can't help it,
but I fear that everybody I love
will disappear.
One day this will end,
but my world will be meaningless.
Do you hear? Somebody's playing.
Across the valley.
Mozart... German dances.
Calm down.
It's over now.
I'm sorry.
I could hear him.
He was just beside me.
I was asleep, but I could hear him.
It was like a voice softly speaking,
seducing me.
I couldn't move,
as if I was accepting it,
as though I agreed.
I opened my eyes,
it jumped on me... and pecked me!
Where did it peck you?
Here.
Come!
You found water?
I can make tea.
No, not here. Later.
I hadn't thought about the birds.
They don't fear men
since they eat them.
You touched it?
The bird? Just a little.
Get up. Stick your hands out!
Rub. Rub them together!
What are you doing?
Don't get close! Stay where you are.
Listen!
I can hear you!
No need to breathe in my face.
- Where does that path go?
- To the main road.
- That leads where?
- Anywhere!
But don't go there.
You'll be robbed by the soldiers.
And that way?
To Sorbiers.
Don't take that road either.
They're all dead!
They didn't want the cure.
What cure?
My cure! My elixir!
Want some?
Made with faraway herbs.
I've saved many lives!
- Do you sell it?
- You expect me to give it away?
Three francs.
Not much to save your ass!
I have given some for free,
but it doesn't work.
Got to pay for it to work.
Like everything.
Here.
I'll buy some and add ten francs.
Which is the safest route to Gap?
Gap is far away.
Two gold coins.
That's too much. Don't accept.
I accept.
It's a dirt track that leads to a fork.
There's a mill. Then, careful.
Take the right road, not the left.
The left goes to Montjay.
That's bad.
Montjay?
We're going there?
- No. Avoid it.
- Why?
Full of soldiers.
They haven't had a single case.
- They're sealed off.
- I have to go there.
You'll be quarantined.
Is there a Mr. Peyrolle there?
He's the mayor.
Do you know where he lives?
Well, that's a big detour.
May I?
May I speak with you?
No more Théus?
- Later. But, first, Montjay.
- Right now?
It's very important, you see.
No, I don't! It's full of soldiers.
Please keep going.
You've wasted enough time on me.
Your friends await you.
He'll take me.
Right? You'll take me to Montjay?
Well, it depends.
I'll pay. Can you get me in town?
Well, I don't know.
- It depends.
- Here!
Don't touch it!
You're out of your mind!
Two coins was too much,
but now you give your ring!
I have no money.
- How much to Montjay?
- Not that. I refuse!
I'm not leaving you with him.
He'll sell you out.
- So, how much?
- Hundred francs.
Get your box out.
In Marseilles,
bodies are piling up!
People have gone mad,
yelling and running.
They say it's the flies.
Flies! What a laugh!
If it were only that.
In Saint-Cyrice it rained toads,
and at Motte a dog read the catechism.
Wait!
What are you doing?
Leave that behind.
Let's go.
They're here. I can see lights.
I'll be leaving.
- Don't you touch me!
- I'm not. It's not over.
- You don't need me.
- Stay with us.
- But why?
- Because!
- Afraid I'll steal the horses?
- Among other things.
I'm telling you.
It's really too much.
See! Thanks, Yvonne.
I love poetry too.
But not minced with politics!
- You can't outlaw it!
- Why?
When Hugo sobs over the worker's plight,
I say: Beware!
He's backing the rebellion!
Don't be fooled!
I beg your pardon.
Is Mr. Peyrolle in?
He just left. What is it about?
I'm Madame de Théus.
My God, don't stay outside! Come in!
I'm Mrs. Peyrolle. He'll be right back.
Go around. I'll open up!
Lucienne! No, Denise!
Go to City Hall. Tell him to come.
Oh, Lord! Hurry!
- What about me? I wait here?
- Jump!
Please forgive us.
Have you dined?
May I... Do you wish something?
- No, please.
- Lucienne! A plate!
Madame, could you...
Mother, sit there.
- I'm Joseph Rigoard, the notary.
- Monsieur.
- Mrs. Rigoard.
- Madame!
Mr. And Mrs. Barthélémy.
We're very honored by your presence.
Joseph, let the marquess take a seat.
Sorry.
Adrien, did you greet
Madame de Théus?
Let him be.
Finish up. Then eat your cake.
When did you arrive?
- Just now.
- Really?
- Where from? Théus?
- No, Manosque.
From Manosque.
My God, it's hell over there!
You weren't in town.
I was. For nearly a month.
I'll never forget what I saw.
So much suffering,
such... such horror.
One cannot imagine.
Pyres burning night and day.
The stench...
unbearable.
Burning what?
Nothing.
No, Madame! Please. Please!
I don't understand.
How did you get here?
Through quarantine?
- God, no. I avoided it.
- Yvonne! Get up!
Move away from her!
Come! Come!
What's happening?
Set the fowl down, Lucienne!
Madame, you are...
It's beyond words!
It's... criminal, truly!
- Joseph!
- What?
She's not above laws!
You've no shame!
She's spreading the disease!
You're making noise.
I can do much more than that!
You'll hurt yourself.
You're irresponsible.
Women like you should be...
Should be what?
Should be what? Finish, sir.
I came from Manosque too.
Have I a story to tell.
I breathed the air and the flies...
and held the dying in my arms.
Where are you going? Stay!
Fear is the real killer!
Look. I'm fine.
I'm perfectly fine!
Come on. Don't stay here.
They insult you.
May I handle my own affairs?
As for me, I ain't hanging around.
Here, wait with him in the garden.
Some wine?
- André, please. André!
- Let me be!
Mr. Peyrolle!
- Isn't your husband with you?
- No.
- Where is he?
- Don't you know?
- How could I?
- You were with him.
A friend.
You were with him in Valence?
Come over here!
Hey, the bottle!
Don't talk about the Valence meeting.
It's a secret. His Highness was there.
I hoped to see you there.
Where's my husband?
Not in Manosque?
No, he wasn't!
He left to go get you.
- When?
- Ten days ago.
My God!
We had to end the meeting.
Weren't you at your aunts?
I waited as long as I could.
I thought... I don't know...
that he didn't get through
and went back to Théus.
The army emptied the town.
I should've...
I'm to blame if he...
Come, sit. There.
I saw him in a dream.
He was on the road...
with the black face of... cholera...
that terrible stone-face.
He was coming towards me.
He held his hand out, and...
and suddenly, he fell...
and his face,
his body burst into flames.
He wanted me to come to Valence.
But I didn't.
I left on my own.
Now, maybe he's...
I know he is. It's my fault!
Don't say that. Not you!
I feel lost.
Stay here a while.
No, not here.
Why? I'll watch over you.
You have nothing to fear from me.
I admire you.
I'm devoted.
You know that?
You know it, right?
- I'm leaving.
- No, wait!
Where to? At night?
Are you going back to Théus?
I don't know.
So, listen. I'll take you!
You'll be safe in the mountains.
- If he doesn't return?
- He'll be back!
Men like him don't die of cholera.
At least he knows for whom he lives.
What's this? Get it out!
- Breathe in, André!
- You're choking us!
- We must disinfect!
- Useless!
- The priest said to.
- Stop it!
Let's not stay here. You're right.
I'll hitch the buggy.
No need.
Madame has an escort.
This way, Lieutenant! Quick!
You have horses?
Thanks.
And money?
Your saddlebags!
They're escaping!
- André, what are you doing?
- Let me be!
Out! Get out of here!
Never come back to my home! Out!
What?
There's no harm in trying?
Stop! Stop!
I didn't do anything!
I didn't dare wake you.
Thank you.
I'm leaving now.
Not before eating something.
I have corn flour for polenta.
Then we go.
- I'm not hungry.
- I insist.
You're pale. You must eat.
I've waited too long already.
I'll leave my teapot.
I won't forget what you did for me.
If you're back in France...
Wait. Where are you going?
Back to Manosque.
Wait a minute!
Wait and think.
I did all night.
You don't even know
where your husband is!
You want me to go home,
while he might be dying?
I can't endure that.
But you're safe!
Don't plunge back into the epidemic!
You're not responsible.
You've not a chance of finding him.
You know it's pointless!
I can see you've never loved.
Get off that horse!
I order you! Dismount!
Miss.
Or is it Mrs.?
What's your name?
I've been here the longest,
so I handle the chores.
They're mandatory.
Even for pretty ladies.
Théus. Madame de Théus.
Like the castle?
This name, Théus.
Was there one here?
No. I'd remember.
You're looking for family?
I'm a colonel
of the Piedmont Hussards.
I respect your laws
and want to go to quarantine.
Sergeant.
This way!
Move over!
Make room!
Out of the way!
Come on!
Will this spot do, Colonel?
Some other spot, sir?
There.
Do a good job.
It's cold by the window.
I'll get a blanket?
I have one.
- If you need me...
- I'm fine.
Your servant, sir.
I forgot! Soup's at 11:00.
- Did they take anything?
- My pistol.
I'll give you one of mine.
I have your teapot.
The food's not safe.
You did it on purpose.
Excuse me?
You got captured on purpose.
I couldn't leave you here.
There are 24 soldiers.
Some are ill. You saw their faces?
In the stairs,
I'll fight two at a time!
I forbid you to fight.
Fine.
And how will we get out, pray tell?
Get out... But to go where?
I have no courage left.
You? I don't believe it.
Before you came, I looked down.
I thought:
It's so easy to die, so brief.
- You just slip away.
- Be quiet.
We can't do a thing.
The disease is everywhere.
Maybe already in us.
That's not true.
Go rest. Sleep.
Don't you ever have doubts?
You are always so sure?
I do my best.
Why do you stay with me?
I could have infected you
just like anybody else.
I slept in your coat.
Cholera avoids me like the plague.
I don't even know your name.
Pardi. Angelo Pardi.
My name is Pauline.
Sorry, sir. I'm disturbing you.
I'm Mr. Petit, seed and feed dealer.
It's about those damned chores.
I can find a replacement.
Interested? Three francs a day.
For both of you, five francs.
Your servant, sir.
Don't! It's your friends' money.
I'll replace it. I've none left.
I have brought you nothing but trouble.
If you hadn't met me,
you'd have crossed the border.
You'd be in Milan with your mother.
Let me be.
Get away. Escape!
I'll make some tea.
Mozart... German dances.
He's a musician from Marseilles.
He was on the road, like us.
People protested.
Now they can't sleep without it.
Did I sleep long?
Pretty long, yes.
Since morning.
I didn't know I was so worn out.
I did. You wouldn't admit it.
You're always right.
It's annoying.
We're leaving tonight.
Fine.
You're ready to follow me?
You won't say that...
I won't say a word or ask anything.
I'll obey like a soldier.
Get up!
Wake up!
- Sir! You're mad!
- Pack up!
- Stop!
- Do it! We're going!
Help! Fire!
Come on! Hurry!
It's locked!
- I told you!
- What now?
- I don't know.
- Wait!
Let me! I'm strong!
Everybody, go back up!
Your rifle.
Let go.
Stand back.
Is that good, Colonel?
Where's my bag?
Careful! It's fragile!
Théus is behind that mountain.
Your country's not far.
I can see Italy from my window.
They say it's bad
down in the valley.
And here? Did you see any soldiers?
What would they do here?
Nobody's dying around here...
except the old folks.
Is it still far?
No, there's a village after the woods.
People know me there. They'll drive us.
This is your land.
My husband's.
Can I buy a house in Théus?
We'll give you one.
Will you leave tonight?
Yes.
Why?
If you wish to stay a bit...
No.
Whose place is this?
Do you know?
Thanks.
She's not happy to see me.
She hated you breaking her door.
Where did they go?
- You think...
- Come warm up.
Sit down.
Wait. I'll be back.
- Where are you going?
- The cellar.
- I'll come.
- Stay and warm up.
You're soaked too.
I'll try to make hot wine.
Don't put that dress on.
- It doesn't look nice?
- It's not safe.
This isn't cholera land.
This is my land,
where I dress in the evening.
Do you like the dress?
I don't know... Yes, I like it.
You know why I chose it?
Why?
It's like the one in Manosque.
I wondered if you'd notice.
I'll dry your jacket out.
- More.
- Not right away.
Yes, right away. Give me some wine.
I'm burning.
You drank a lot. It's not sensible.
Sensible. I admire you.
Always so sensible. Obstinately so.
Isn't it tiresome, so young?
Sometimes.
It's strange.
You're both so young and so old.
Older than my husband who's
forty years older. He's never sensible.
So I gathered.
You don't even know him.
You don't even ask questions about him.
Normally, people gape
when I say how old he is.
What am I supposed to do?
Shout?
Am I nothing to you?
I know what people think.
A country doctor's daughter,
my husband's name and fortune.
They only think about that...
When I met him,
he was beside a stream,
a bullet in the chest...
nearly dead.
I ran to get my father.
We took him home.
I was 16.
My father saved him,
but I tended to him,
day and night, for weeks.
I didn't know who he was,
nor why he was wounded.
I didn't dare ask.
He was so mysterious.
My father cured him, and he left.
I was convinced he had forgotten me.
Six months later, he came back...
and proposed to me.
Stay! You never speak about yourself.
Tomorrow we part!
- What's to say?
- Talk to me.
About her.
- Who?
- Your mother.
What about my mother?
Is there anyone else in your life?
You're drunk.
She knows you're going back?
No.
She'll stop you from fighting.
Oh, no. She waited 20 years
for this revolt.
Isn't she afraid for you?
Never.
- We must go.
- Not now.
The storm's over.
I'm fine here.
I don't want to leave.
It's late.
Let's sleep here and leave tomorrow.
Come on.
Leave if you wish. I'm staying.
Fine.
You're really odd.
You followed me since Manosque.
You were my knight, my guardian angel.
And now you rush to pack your bags
like you're escaping.
I'm not running away.
I'm leaving before dark.
I can hear your mother:
" Never spend a night alone in a house
with a woman."
You're raving.
What's wrong?
It's the wine, I think.
My mother isn't like you imagine her.
For her, I...
I'm never crazy enough.
She's right.
Forgive me.
Will you find your way?
I'll stay a while.
I'm tired.
Don't lie in those beds.
Don't bother about me.
Pauline.
I'd rather die.
I covered you up. You were freezing.
I feel so weak.
You nearly died.
Give me your hand.
There's the marquis!
Laurent.
<i>Dear Angelo, Where are you?</i>
<i>I'm writing to you in Turin...</i>
<i>where you said your mother lived.</i>
<i>I hope her name</i>
<i>is enough for an address.</i>
<i>But if she gets it,</i>
<i>will she know where to find you?</i>
<i>We heard about the uprising</i>
<i>against the Austrians.</i>
<i>Were you part of it?</i>
<i>I'm sure you were.</i>
<i>The news tells of war</i>
<i>spreading throughout your Italy.</i>
<i>That is what compels me to write you.</i>
<i>You must be happy in the revolution</i>
<i>you so longed for,</i>
<i>but the tales ofbattle</i>
<i>fill me with worry.</i>
<i>I implore you to write.</i>
<i>At least tell me you're alive.</i>
<i>It was a year...</i>
<i>before the cholera disappeared</i>
<i>as it had come.</i>
<i>It reached Paris, and we feared</i>
<i>it might spread over all of France.</i>
<i>Last summer I went back to Aix.</i>
<i>Everything looks the same.</i>
<i>Yet nothing is.</i>
<i>The plague ravaged this city</i>
<i>more than elsewhere.</i>
<i>It's impossible to forget. Seeing</i>
<i>the carefree people, one wonders...</i>
<i>where they were, who they lost.</i>
<i>Where did you live in Aix?</i>
<i>You never told me.</i>
<i>You say so little.</i>
<i>You talked about a place</i>
<i>near the Bishop's Palace.</i>
<i>This might sound strange,</i>
<i>but I think I found the house.</i>
<i>For a long time,</i>
<i>Pauline's letter went unanswered.</i>
<i>She'd given up hope,</i>
<i>when, the following year,</i>
<i>a letter arrived from Italy.</i>
<i>Laurent de Théus knew before Pauline</i>
<i>that memories of Angelo would not fade.</i>
<i>He already knew</i>
<i>that when she chose to go to him,</i>
<i>he would open his hand...</i>
<i>and let her leave.</i>
