<i>London calling... with Frenchmen</i>
<i>speaking to their countrymen.</i>
Take a look at that! What
a handsome sight...
...the pride of the Third Reich!
The brave sergeant taking
coffee to the beachgunners.
So that's a sample of the
master race! In a pig's eye!
In this darkest hour, in
the gloom of night...
...we must not despair.
For each of us...
...deliverance is coming!
We need mines and obstacles
along the whole coast.
At every beach, on every dune...
...on every rock.
How many have been installed?
Four million, Herr Field Marshal.
The work has completely
exhausted our troops.
Which would your troops rather be...
...exhausted or dead?
Just look at it, gentlemen.
How calm... how peaceful it is.
A strip of water between
England and the Continent...
...between the Allies and us.
But beyond that peaceful
horizon... a monster waits!
A coiled spring of men,
ships and planes...
...straining to be released against us.
But not a single Allied soldier
shall reach the shore.
Whenever or wherever this invasion
may come, gentlemen...
...I shall destroy the enemy
there... at the water's edge!
Believe me, gentlemen.
The first 24 hours of the
invasion will be decisive.
For the Allies as well as the Germans,
it will be the longest day...
...the longest day!
The poem by Verlaine?
Play it back!
<i>Frenchmen speaking to their countrymen.</i>
<i>Here are some personal messages.</i>
<i>"The long sobs of the violins of autumn."</i>
<i>I repeat:</i>
<i>"The long sobs of the violins of autumn."</i>
Have you notified all commands?
If Berlin is right,
when we intercept the second verse...
...it will mean the invasion
will come within 24 hours.
Give me the text of the second verse.
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."
We've intercepted hundreds of messages
in the last year... hundreds!
I've ordered alerts again and again.
Why should this poem mean more
than other messages?
Tell me this:
Does it give us any clue as to
where they will land and when?
Of course it doesn't.
How can I maintain discipline if
I keep my troops on the alert...
...just because a pair of nitwits
in Berlin intercept a poem?
No, Blumentritt... no alert!
And especially not in this weather!
- Anything else?
- No, sir.
Good morning, Field Marshal.
- Any news?
- Nothing important.
Fighter bombers hit the Pas-de-
Calais yesterday afternoon.
Nothing much happened
last night... the storm.
That's all I'm interested in
this morning... the storm.
It came from nowhere...
blew my roses to bits.
There are five-foot waves
in the Channel...
...and winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour.
For the month of June...
...it's the worst Channel
storm in 20 years.
My appointment at Berchtesgaden?
General Jodl will see the FÃ¼hrer today...
...and confirm the appointment for you.
Will you still go to Germany as planned?
Can you think of a better time?
The weather is expected to continue
like this for another week.
One moment, Colonel Priller.
Why wasn't he court-martialed?
He shot down 132 planes.
Don't call me "Pips, old boy."
You were a rotten pilot
when we flew in Russia.
You're flying a desk now, but
you're still a rotten pilot!
What's that you're saying?
I'm squatting here on this
God-forsaken airfield...
...with only two planes...
two stinking crates!
Oh, sure, sure... your
orders were followed!
Now my squadrons are God-knows-where!
My supplies are all gone. What
am I supposed to do now?
But Pips, we had to disperse our
fighter squadrons... we had to!
Look what happened to our airstrips
around the Pas-de-Calais!
The whole idea is absolutely idiotic!
You move us back instead of forward!
Sure, I know the weather's lousy
and they probably won't invade...
...but what would happen if they did?
But you know I can't get there
with my equipment for two days.
I tell you, you're all crazy!
Priller has always been a hothead...
...but let's not underestimate him.
What he says is not entirely illogical.
What's the weather report?
Slightly better over the Channel.
I wouldn't be surprised if...
- When's the next weather report?
- Tonight at 8, General.
Keep me posted on the weather.
You made my dinner reservations?
Yes, I did, General.
Cancel everything.
Shoes for my wife, I had them
specially made in Paris...
...for her birthday... tomorrow,
the sixth of June.
Please wish her a happy birthday.
Thank you, Speidel.
Why didn't they attack in May?
The weather was perfect...
An attack now would be embarrassing.
But I don't think we need worry.
Is the plan ready, sir?
Yes, yes, quite finished.
War games...
...theoretical invasions.
Rush to Rennes just to push
little flags around a table.
Playing at war!
Do you win or lose, sir?
Have I ever lost?
But General, this time you play
the role of Eisenhower.
I win because I go against the rules.
We expect them to cross at the
narrowest part of the Channel...
...and in good weather. But that's
too simple... too obvious.
I choose the widest part, in the
worst weather... and attack here.
In Normandy.
And in bad weather!
Like now...
...bad weather!
A brilliant plan, General.
Unorthodox, but brilliant.
Fortunately, it's only a game.
I don't think we have
much to worry about.
Eisenhower would never
take the gamble.
Never.
<i>London calling with messages</i>
<i>for our friends.</i>
<i>"Molasses tomorrow will</i>
<i>bring forth cognac. "</i>
<i>"John has a long mustache."</i>
<i>I repeat:</i>
<i>"John has a long mustache."</i>
"John has a long mustache!"
No, not yet...
Oh, my Lord!
"John has a long mustache."
<i>"There is a fire at the travel agency."</i>
<i>I repeat:</i>
<i>"There is a fire at the travel agency."</i>
<i>"Wounds my heart with a</i>
<i>monotonous languor. "</i>
<i>I repeat:</i>
<i>"Wounds my heart with a</i>
<i>monotonous languor. "</i>
The bridge... in forty-five minutes.
We'll be back.
<i>"Wounds my heart with a</i>
<i>monotonous languor. "</i>
<i>I repeat:</i>
<i>"Wounds my heart with a</i>
<i>monotonous languor. "</i>
<i>"There is a fire at the travel agency."</i>
The best hand I've had all night.
Let me see here...
Pardon me.
Pardon me, General... it's come!
Wait. Give that to me.
What's come?
It's the second part of the message.
The second verse.
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."
We can expect the invasion
within 24 hours!
Put the Fifteenth Army on full alert.
Thank you.
You know, I'm too old a bunny to
get very excited about all this.
Now... where was I...?
Oh yes, two spades!
Happy birthday, General...
from your staff!
Thank you.
Will you cut the cake, sir?
I trust you don't
expect me to eat it, too!
Hello! Hello!
Clear.
It's working!
It's raining again.
Thank you.
Did you get the list?
Gen. Schlieben of the 709th has
already left for the war games.
The Commander of the 243rd
left for Rennes at 18:00 hours.
Also, Zimmermann of the 352nd...
twelve officers in all.
Yes, I know.
The weather is bad, so everyone
enjoys an extra night in Rennes.
I don't like it.
Any of it.
So many key officers are
away at the same time.
I don't know why, but I don't like it.
But the war games have been
scheduled for a week...
Yes, for tomorrow... not tonight.
Advise all officers who have
not yet left for Rennes...
...to postpone their
departure until tomorrow.
May I remind you, General...
...that the Allies have always landed
in perfect weather conditions.
North Africa... Sicily... Italy...
Yes, and always at dawn!
I understand. And when will
the Field Marshal return?
I see. Oh, well.
Just a moment.
The radar report.
We are getting reports of
strong radar interference...
...and radio reception is jammed.
I realize this has happened before,
but never this effectively!
And the...
Call the OB West? Very well.
Give my respects to the Field
Marshal when he returns.
Call for reinforcements!
We're under attack!
- Are we late?
- No, but...
...we must hurry!
What is it?
I'll go.
Stop!
We said, stop!
Stop, or I'll shoot!
What are you doing here?
I live in that farm.
Nobody lives in that farm.
- It's abandoned.
- Show me your papers.
Hurry up!
Come with me.
Go on!
Put your bicycle there.
Hans!
Hans, where are you?
- What's going on here?
- Nothing!
Who is with you? I want to know!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Good luck at the war games, General.
Anything important?
Communications reports difficulty
in contacting our forward posts.
The Underground again!
Some sort of rubber dummies have
been dropped by parachute.
Rubber dummies!
Connect me with General Richter!
We can expect commando raids
and other diversionary tactics...
...but I don't like this idea
of dummy parachutists.
Are you certain?
How many?
What do you think of it?
Paratroopers...
Put it over there.
This is what they dropped, they
explode on contact with the earth.
In the dark, they look like soldiers.
Perhaps these are what General
Richter saw, not real paratroopers.
When you create a diversion,
it's for a reason.
Connect me with General Pemsel!
Dummies...?!
Rubber dummies!
I agree with you, General.
I'll call you back.
What about my call to von Rundstedt?
We haven't been able to reach him.
The main lines seem to be cut.
They wouldn't drop dummies...
...unless it was to divert our
attention from something else.
In this weather?
In any kind of weather!
I must get in touch with OB West.
They're enemy paratroopers!
Where have you come from?
Pluskat.
Hello, Pluskat! Do you hear me?
Nothing that I've heard...
The usual bombing, but quite distant.
Oh, yes, I can hear it.
Well, wait a minute.
Yes, just a moment.
Flares... but a long way up the coast.
Yes, Cherbourg is getting hit again.
There's probably nothing to it...
...but we have had reports
of paratrooper landings.
I'll go to my bunker and take a look.
Thank you, sir.
Higher! Higher!
Louis, open your store.
We need more buckets!
Mayor Renaud, you must
come with me immediately.
- Is it important?
- Very important, Mayor Renaud.
What's wrong, madam?
I was on my way to the
little house outside...
Suddenly, I saw a man
fall from the sky.
- A parachutist?
- Yes, that's right.
He looked like a big white bird!
- British or German?
- What?
The parachutist... was he
a friend or an enemy?
I don't know. He disappeared
without a word. Just "Shh!"
- Without a word?
- Just "Shh!"
Paratroopers!
Anything new?
Heavy bombing over
Cherbourg as usual, sir...
...and now near Caen.
The lines to Stations 6
and 8 have been cut...
...but the direct line is open.
I'll stay for a while.
- Would you like coffee?
- Yes, thank you.
Hundreds of planes have been
flying to my left and right.
Toward Caen.
Now over the Cherbourg peninsula...
something must be happening!
But what, Pluskat, what?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Has anything been
observed on the beaches?
No... nothing.
Yes, I'll let you know right away.
Of course.
From the latest reports,
this is how I see it:
American paratroopers have landed...
British paratroopers...
The invasion...
Yes. Thank you, Pemsel.
General Pemsel is convinced
that this is the invasion!
I do not agree with him.
This is my conclusion:
Normandy is the objective
of a diversionary attack.
A diversionary attack, Blumentritt.
It's not the main attack. That will
come at the Pas-de-Calais...
...where it was always expected.
Where we always expected it!
But we can't take any chances.
I want the reserve panzers
moved up at once!
We need approval from the
FÃ¼hrer's headquarters.
They wouldn't dare refuse me!
Call the FÃ¼hrer's headquarters
and insist.
Insist that the panzers be
released to me immediately!
An invasion of Normandy would
be against all military logic.
It would really be against all logic...
Good luck.
The street...
...the bridge...
...the hotel...
...the casino.
One more thing...
You have been fighting
everywhere for four years...
...in Abyssinia, Libya, Egypt, Crete...
But this time you are going
to fight on French soil...
...in our fields...
...in our villages...
...under the eyes of our own people.
The FÃ¼hrer took a sedative, I won't
wake him for these reports.
First we hear that the paratroopers
are shot down plane crews.
Next they are identified
as mechanical dummies.
If paratroopers have landed...
...it can only be a commando raid.
Is that a sufficient reason to send
the panzers to the coast?
I will submit all reports to the
FÃ¼hrer as soon as he awakens.
I understand.
Jodl has turned us down.
He will not release the panzers
without the FÃ¼hrer's approval...
...and the FÃ¼hrer is still asleep!
Will you tell von Rundstedt?
No, not now...
Not now.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Sit down.
This is history!
We are living an historical moment.
We are going to lose the war...
...because the glorious FÃ¼hrer
has taken a sleeping pill...
...and is not to be awakened.
It's unbelievable.
Think of it, Kurt.
Don't ever forget it.
We are witnessing something...
...which historians will always
say is completely improbable...
...and yet it is true.
The FÃ¼hrer is not to be awakened!
I sometimes wonder
whose side God is on.
Can I...
...bring you anything, sir?
In my room there is a bottle
of excellent cognac...
...Napoleon, unopened.
I was even saving it for
a fitting occasion.
This isn't exactly the right
occasion, but get it anyway.
Daylight at last.
A whole night wasted again!
Where's my dog?
He was here a minute ago.
Let's have one last look.
Not even a seagull...
My God!
The invasion.
They're coming!
It's the invasion! There must be
five thousand ships out there!
Get hold of yourself, Pluskat.
The enemy doesn't have
even half that many.
Well dammit! Come and see
for yourself, you fool!
It's amazing.
It's beyond belief.
My dear Pluskat, where are
these ships heading?
Straight for me!
Your attention, please.
The Admiral has an announcement.
Soon we shall be engaged in battle.
To drive the enemy out, we must
fire on our homeland.
This is the price of liberty.
Long live France!
There he goes, right on time... as usual.
They're landing!
They're coming! They're coming!
I'm not crazy.
Look, they're landing!
The Americans, the English
and the French!
Do you hear me? What's the matter
with you? What's going on?
You must be deaf! Can't you...?
Dammit can't you hear
it for yourself?
We're under fire. Yes, under fire!
Those five thousand ships you
say the Allies haven't got...
...well, they've got them!
It's wonderful!
Yes? What is it now?
Listen to me, Pips.
The invasion has started!
Put yourself on alert at once!
What the hell can I do
with only two planes?
Where are the others, you idiots?!
Priller, that's an order! Get
ready at once! Understand?
If it isn't too much trouble...
...would you tell me where
the invasion is?
Normandy! How delightful!
Thanks my faithful Hans.
That's the end for us! So long!
It's getting very difficult to
get any sleep around here.
Your prospects for a long sleep are
excellent. The invasion has begun.
We're flying there, the two of us.
Nobody else is left.
I don't think we're coming back.
The shelling has stopped.
Landing craft approaching.
Return to headquarters. Direct
your troops from there!
Landing craft approaching the coast!
Those French bastards!
Sergeant!
Send this to headquarters by courier.
No! Take it yourself. Tell
them our lines are cut!
Gentlemen, come here please.
Lock on the target!
Follow me. Do everything I do!
All right. Let's go!
Head for home!
The Luftwaffe has had its great moment!
Long live France!
Long live the Allies!
Thank you, dear, they're lovely!
Better try them on first.
Rommel speaking.
Good morning.
What?
What!
Where?
Normandy!
Have they a foothold already?
They must be thrown back!
What about the panzer reserves?
Did von Rundstedt obtain
their release from the FÃ¼hrer?
Normandy!
How stupid of me!
Normandy. It really is Normandy.
This is madness... madness...
sheer madness!
I just talked to General Jodl...
the FÃ¼hrer is awake.
I don't care if he's awake or not!
What about the reserve panzers?
The FÃ¼hrer went into
one of his tantrums...
...and no one dared
bring up the subject.
They're still held in reserve!
Yes, Field Marshal.
Sir, if you would call
the FÃ¼hrer yourself...
...I am convinced he would
respect your views.
Call him?
Call that Bohemian corporal?!
Crawl on my knees to him?!
No! It is out of the question!
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."
What's that?
Nothing... nothing of importance.
Fall back!
Take cover!
Tank support!
We must have tank support!
I can't get them!
Keep trying! We must have support!
Hold your positions...
I'm going for a tank!
Give us as much cover as you can!
Fire!
Try for the cannon!
Get the wounded out of here!
Go back!
Get out of here!
You can't stay here!
I am Mother Superior of the convent.
The sisters are qualified nurses.
But Madame... I mean, Mother,
we're in the middle of a battle!
Take care of the wounded.
It's a tank!
It's Kieffer!
In the other direction!
Clear away the debris! Hurry!
But where is the Luftwaffe?!
I'm trying...
Yeah, yeah, you're trying.
The British troops have a beachhead
here. They are moving inland.
The Americans hold Ste-MÄre-Eglise
and have cut the highway.
We control this center section.
The Americans have landed but
their attack has bogged down.
Rommel is right...
If we can hold them on the beaches...
...the invasion will collapse.
No, no! We must regroup
according to Plan Six!
Can you hear me?
I said we must regroup
according to Plan Six.
Nonsense!
If the panzers arrive, we still
have time to use them.
We'll drive to the coast!
Shall we remove the files?
I don't care! I want to get to the
front at once... to Normandy!
Yes, General.
We must leave. The main highway
is under aerial attack.
You don't say!
