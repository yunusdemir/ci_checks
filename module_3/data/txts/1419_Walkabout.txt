<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh.</i>
Mmm, oh. Mmm, oh.
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.
<i>Kuh, kuh, kuh, kuh, kuh.</i>
<i>A, E, I, O, U.</i>
<i>The ortolan is the name given
to a European singing bird.</i>
<i>It is extremely rare.</i>
<i>When fattened for eating,
they are left in dark cardboard boxes...</i>
<i>and packets of grain are pressed
to a hole in the box...</i>
<i>through which a light is shone.</i>
<i>The bird picks desperately at the grain
in the hope of penetrating through to the light...</i>
<i>which he mistakes for the sun.</i>
<i>This goes on for several weeks.</i>
<i>When it has eaten itself so full
that it cannot stand or see...</i>
<i>it is drowned in cognac.</i>
<i>Gourmets regard it
as an exceptional delicacy.</i>
<i>You will find vinegar is an
acceptable substitute for cognac.</i>
Stay there. Don't move.
Come on. Swim out.
Come on. Further.
Come on.
- Help! No!
- Stop.
- Swim back.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Now try. It's not far.
- Watch, Dad.
<i>...although there are a few of them
available in tins in the better shops now.</i>
Give me the radio.
<i>...so you have to learn to tell
a fish knife from a meat knife...</i>
<i>and a fish fork from a meat fork.
<i>If there's no fish knife and fork,
use the smaller knife and fork for the fish.</i>
- <i>If you make a mistake, just continue eating.</i>
- This one's red.
- <i>Don't put the silver back on the table.</i>
- This one's yellow.
<i>Be nonchalant.</i>
- <i>The place for the napkin is on the lap.</i>
- This one's brown with yellow stripes.
Please don't speak with your mouth full, Son.
<i>The fish or meat will be served to you
on your left side.</i>
- This one's green. This one's white.
- <i>Take the serving fork in your left hand...</i>
<i>and the serving spoon in your right.</i>
- Oh, there's another red one.
- <i>Don't eat chicken with your fingers except at a picnic.</i>
You stopped again.
- Come back!
- He's all right.
Don't go out of sight!
We'll eat now.
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! You're dead!
I'm hot.
The wheel's come off.
Dad, my wheel's come off.
The wheel's come off.
- Chicken or ham?
- Both!
<i>I think I know now
what's making me sad</i>
Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
- It's ready.
- Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!
Quick, men! Duck!
Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
You're dead!
That's not fair!
He'll get away!
You're supposed to be on my side!
Shh. Come on.
What are you doing?
Come on.
And bring him with you.
It's getting late.
I've got to go now.
We can't waste time.
Come out now!
We have got to go now!
I... have got to go now.
Can't - Can't waste time.
We can't wa -
Come out now!
Stay here.
- What happened?
- He said we were to go on ahead.
He said I wasn't to go out of his sight.
He'll catch us up later.
Do you know where to go?
Yes, of course.
This way.
<i>Who saw him die</i>
<i>I, said the fly</i>
<i>With my little eye</i>
<i>I saw him die</i>
It's getting dark, isn't it?
Pass me that.
- Aren't you tired?
- A bit.
- Are we going to stay here all night?
- If you like.
Yes, please.
But we didn't bring any blankets.
I don't think I'm really tired yet.
Where are you going?
In the bushes.
<i>Come what may, your life goes on</i>
Lizards!
What you looking at?
I'm looking for a light.
Why? There won't be anybody there.
It's time you went to sleep.
We've got to be up early in the morning.
I'm going to sleep here.
Shall we take turns at being sentries?
- No.
- Oh.
We haven't even got any water,
have we?
There's plenty of lemonade.
You can have some in the morning.
Are you all right?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Wasn't it nice last night?
- Did you like it?
- Yes.
- I had a dream.
- I know. You kept fidgeting.
- You're dropping everything.
- What?
The ammunition's falling out.
I tore my blazer.
It doesn't matter.
Come on.
- You won't tell Dad, will you?
- No.
What's up here?
We can see where we are
from the top.
Well, where are we now?
We've just got to climb that one.
- But you said -
- Then we can see where we are.
- But you said -
- Come on. I'll race you.
Oh, crikey. My legs ache.
There's the sea!
It's the sea!
It is the sea, isn't it?
Maybe.
What sea is it?
What's its name?
I don't really know.
<i>Beneath the granite and basaltic crust...</i>
<i>is the mantle of iron magnesium
and possibly a sulfide-and-oxide shell...</i>
<i>an outer core of molten nickel iron -</i>
You must have lost it
when we were going up the cliff...
to find out where we were.
- I told you it was all falling out.
- <i>...which means, one day, the world will end.</i>
Are you sure it isn't in your satchel?
Yes.
<i>Apart from the scientific explanation,
the expectation that the world...</i>
<i>that is, that human society
will someday come to an end -</i>
- It isn't there.
- I've made a hole.
- Look.
- <i>...and that it is he who imparts dignity...
- Go on. Have a drink.
- <i>and interest to the planet on which he lives...</i>
- <i>although not receiving importance from it.</i>
- Leave some for me.
<i>The idea that man has passed
through 10,000 years of trial and suffering...</i>
<i>in order that there might be, at last,
a perpetual succession of comfortable shopkeepers -</i>
- I was listening.
- We mustn't waste the batteries.
Dad said they last for 400 hours.
- Are you hungry?
- Not yet.
- We ought to eat some salt.
- Why?
Uncle Ted said when they
were soldiers in the desert...
they always had to eat salt.
It doesn't taste salty.
- What are you doing?
- I mustn't step in those steps.
That means we won't get home by tonight.
I'm fed up.
No, you're not.
Come on.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
You walk on all the ridges,
and I'll practice my voice lessons.
Puh, puh, puh.
Puh, puh, puh.
Puh, puh, puh, puh, puh.
Puh. Puh, puh, puh.
Puh, puh, puh.
Do you want a drink?
No. I'm not sweating now.
Oh, come back!
I can't walk down there!
It isn't fair!
Oh, please make him come.
I'm not coming back.
We've got to get on.
It's late.
I'm going now.
Please. Please try.
It can't be much further.
It's silly to give in now.
It's getting late.
We've got to go.
We can't waste time.
I'll carry you for a bit.
You're awake now.
What?
If you're awake,
you should try and walk.
You should try and help me.
I'm tired too.
Look!
What's that?
- What?
- That.
<i>Who'll sing a psalm</i>
<i>I, said the thrush</i>
<i>As she sat on a bush</i>
<i>I'll sing a psalm</i>
You said you were too tired to walk.
It tastes lovely.
It's all right.
The birds are eating it.
It tastes like meat.
<i>Today is Armistice Day.</i>
<i>And at 12:00, there will be a three-minute silence
followed by a service of remembrance.</i>
<i>Meanwhile, we rejoin Captain Steele
and Dusty, counteragents...</i>
<i>in another episode of Enemy.</i>
<i>If we make the bridge, Dusty -</i>
Does drinking give you
a big, red, fat nose?
- Why?
- I was just wondering.
Is that why Dad's nose is all freckly?
I don't know.
I've got a fly
without any wings in my cap.
<i>The bridge is blown!
Brake, Captain! Brake!</i>
Did our car crash?
You must look after your blazer.
It's got to last.
<i>Yes, skipper, I'm okay.</i>
We don't want people thinking
we're a couple of tramps.
What people?
Did Dad tear his clothes?
Perhaps that's why he sent us on.
And you've got a hole in your pocket.
- When are we going there?
- Where?
Back home.
In a few days.
That's the trouble with all these series.
You always know the superhero's
gonna get away with it.
That's the trouble with Batman.
and in The Saint.
You always know he's gonna win
all the fights in the end.
That's the trouble with all these series.
Even Bugs Bunny wins all the time.
If we were superheroes,
we would definitely win.
Yes.
- Are we superheroes?
- I don't know.
- I hope so.
- So do I.
We're lost, aren't we?
No, of course not.
Don't.
You'll ruin your nice shoes.
What happened?
Birds ate it all.
But they couldn't have drunk
all the water.
Is there any in the bottle?
No.
Why didn't you fill it up?
We should have picked some fruit.
Which way are we going today?
I hope we find lots of sand.
I don't like climbing up those hills much.
They make my legs ache.
I don't suppose it matters
which way we go.
We'll stay here.
Perhaps the water will come back.
Where from?
You shouldn't walk about in the sun.
It's bad for you.
Dad.
- I want a drink!
- Where are the others?
- You can't just go.
- Quick, stop him! He's getting away!
Oi! Oi!
Uh, we're English!
English!
Do you understand?
This is Australia, yes?
- Where is Adelaide?
- Ask him for water!
Water. Drink.
We want water to drink.
You must understand.
Anyone can understand that.
We want to drink.
I can't make it any simpler.
Water - to drink.
The water hole has dried up.
Where do they keep the water?
Water!
<i>Who'll carry the link</i>
<i>I, said the linnet</i>
<i>I'll fetch it in a minute</i>
<i>I'll carry the link</i>
Look! Look!
<i>For what set of values for "X"...</i>
<i>is 4-3(X-4)...</i>
<i>equal to X-2(4-X)?</i>
<i>Write 24, 48 -</i>
Seven fours are 28.
Eight fours are 32.
I can multiply 84 by 84.
I did it yesterday.
<i>Divide 3,893 by -</i>
- <i>What is .5 of 12 minus a third?</i>
- This is one of my soldiers.
<i>Give your answer as a decimal.</i>
Hey!
Put your shirt on.
- He hasn't got his shirt on.
- He hasn't got a shirt.
He can have mine.
It wouldn't fit him.
<i>Leaving Adelaide at noon,
Harry drives at a steady speed -</i>
That's a soldier.
- Give him one.
- No.
Don't be mean.
I expect he'd like to play.
He's never had any toys of his own.
I haven't got any.
<i>Peter left his home at Mildura...</i>
<i>and cycled towards his uncle's house
50 miles away.</i>
<i>After one hour,
traveling at 10 miles an hour...</i>
<i>he stopped for a drink,

Give me a piggyback!
Give me a piggyback!
Ow! No! No! No!
It's your own fault.
He'll roast you in blood and eat you for dinner.
Help! Help! Put me down!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Get up!
Hey! No!
I'm not coming down!
No! Get down! No!
Go on! It's great! Get up!
Go on! Get up! I did!
Pull!
Don't just hang there.
No. Carry me.
Jump! Jump!
Come on! Grab me!
Hurry!
Jump! It's my turn!
It's my turn now!
Come on! Jump!
Let me go!
Come on! Swing me!
<i>Waldo's Motor Mart is in Allen Road,
Camperdown, next to the hospital.</i>
<i>If you've got a good, clean,
low-mileage car you'd like to sell...</i>
<i>Waldo's Motor Mart will help you
turn that car into cash.</i>
<i>And now, back to Night Beat.</i>
Good night.
I'll be all right in the morning.
They got a bit sore from -
Oh, dear.
<i>All right, let's go now.</i>
<i>Come out now!</i>
<i>And bring him with you.</i>
<i>Nothing can ever be created or destroyed.</i>
<i>Come on. It's my turn!
It's my turn now! Give me a go!</i>
<i>Every man and every woman is a star.</i>
<i>What can we know -</i>
<i>By the telescope, a faint -</i>
I told you to keep your clothes on.
What?
No.
I'll show you how to do karate.
There's a pool down there.
So the boy said,
"I ought to be getting home from work."
He lived with his mother
in a house on top of the hill.
She had never spoken to him.
He'd never heard her say a word.
He thought she was dumb,
and she was blind too.
But every evening,
when he came up the hill...
he saw her sitting in the window,
and she was talking.
But as soon as she heard his key
in the lock, she'd stop.
And when he got inside,
she wouldn't say a word.
So, one evening, he made up his mind
to hear what she was saying.
- So he put the ladder -
- No, he went round the back.
Oh, yes. He went round the back
and got the ladder.
- And he set it -
- He carried it.
Yes, he carried it round
to the front of the house...
and set it up against the window.
You didn't explain
that she was sitting upstairs.
- I did.
- You didn't. You left it out.
Well, anyway -
I don't know why you're telling him all this.
He can't understand.
He doesn't know what a ladder is.
I expect we're the first
white people he's seen.
It was very, very long and heavy...
and he only just managed to get it
in position in front of the house.
Next, he climbed up the ladder
and got on the windowsill.
But he couldn't hear a word.
She was only a few feet away
behind the window.
And her blind eyes
were staring straight at him...
and her mouth
was opening and shutting.
But he couldn't hear
because she was speaking silently to herself.
So he put his ear to the glass,
but he still couldn't hear.
So he decided to come down.
But the windowsill was very narrow.
And when he turned round,
he knocked the ladder down!
So he was stuck.
He couldn't jump down
because it was too far...
and he couldn't shout to his mother...
because then she'd know
he'd been spying on her.
So he just sat there.
It got dark, and because there wasn't
very much room on the sill...
his legs grew very stiff.
Sometimes, some people went past...
but he couldn't shout to them for help
because his mother would hear.
So, there was a drainpipe
going down the wall...
and the boy thought,
"If I reach across and get hold of that...
I'll be able to climb down."
So he reached across,
but he slipped off the windowsill...
and fell down and broke his neck.
I told you.
He doesn't understand.
Well, his mother went on
sitting there and talking to herself...
and she began to get worried
because he was late home from work...
and his dinner would get spoiled.
So she said -
No, she didn't.
She didn't say anything to him.
- She got up -
- Oh, that's right.
- and groped her way down the stairs -
- There's another aeroplane!
Do you think he understood
when I drew this house?
That doesn't look like a house.
You can't draw.
That looks like a platypus
walking in space.
Or a pterodactyl flying under the sea.
I think he might take us to the moon.
I wish we had a proper pencil.
Why did you say we were
the first white people he's ever seen?
I always thought you had lots of crayons
and pencils in your satchel.
Please have a look.
By the look of that,
I think he's gonna take us to Mars.
Ah, we won't find it, Hil.
Once them balloons get loose,
they're away.
Perhaps.
Ah, you won't find that.
2-0-1.
Look from time to time, please.
They're expensive, and I don't like
to waste expensive things.
Sure. Sure.
Well, I better get back
to me mud pies.
Well, I'll be off then.
You all right for smokes, Hil?
What?
On me.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Go on.
But that is three packets
I have to owe you.
Well, don't worry about it.
I'm trying to give it up.
Say, that's nice.
Hey! There goes another one!
Hey! Stop it!
Hey!
Hey, stop it!
So expensive.
Hey! Stop it!
Stop it!
<i>Los Angeles</i>
<i>Los Angeles by morning is so fine</i>
Hey, it's muddy in the water.
<i>Especially in the early morning sunshine</i>
It's muddy in the water.
<i>There you'll be in front of me</i>
<i>So I'll catch up and turn
to see you look my way</i>
<i>And smile</i>
- <i>We'll walk a while</i>
- Please. Put me down.
<i>New, shiny day, Los Angeles is fine</i>
<i>Los Angeles is fine</i>
<i>Especially in the early morning sunshine</i>
How's it goin', boy?
I said, "How's things?"
You got ear trouble?
Suit yourself.
Move it. Go on. Quicker. Move it.
Stick 'em right over there.
That's right.
Get that bloody dingo out of here!
It's the last time I'm warning you!
Here.
Paint your titties with that.
Lovely.
Be careful with those.
They're valuable.
Oi, knock off.
Knock off for about 10 minutes.
And no sneakin' off.
We got a lot of work to do.
- <i>You shut the door.</i>
- <i>The kids.</i>
<i>The window's open.</i>
<i>I'm hot.</i>
Hey!
Look what I found!
Over here!
Come on!
That must be a weather balloon.
This black one's bigger.
And it's ticking.
I wonder where it came from.
Probably someone's listening to it.
Will it hurt me?
No, of course not.
How long will it take?
Ask him. Ask him how long it will be
before we get anywhere.
Ask him how long.
Go on.
We'll be there today!
Hey!
There's lots of water out there.
- It's coming up out the ground.
- That's a spring.
He wants me to go and fetch some wood.
All right.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
<i>...there's predestination
or free will required.</i>
<i>We know now that that that is, is.</i>
Water.
Water.
Water.
Yes, water.
Sorry, but that's all I could find.
I didn't -
know where -
Where are we going?
It's a road!
It's a real road!
Where does it go?
You're making me drop my sticks.
I like these.
All right.
Hello.
Didn't I get a lot?
There's lots more there. Didn't I get a lot?
Where have you been? I -
Picking these.
He showed me where to get them.
Didn't I get a lot?
They're my favorites.
Remember?
- Where are you going?
- Out.
No. Stay here.
Here.
I've got lots of them.
Why won't he speak?
What's he dancing for?
I don't know.
Perhaps he's pleased.
Why?
Because we got here at last.
Where are you going now?
Aren't you hungry now?
Please leave him alone.
You haven't cooked the meat yet.
The radio's gone.
Oh.
The battery's gone.
No.
Dad said they last for 400 hours.
How long is that? It's longer than
we've been walking, I bet.
Leave it.
We won't need it much longer.
Put it down and go to sleep.
I want to start early in the morning.
I think he wants to stay here.
- Why should he?
- It's nice.
I think that he wants
to stay here for a while.
There's lots of those
growing out there.
Anyway, I've already decided something.
We're going on our own tomorrow.
Why?
- That's best.
- No!
Suppose he wanted to do something
or something happened?
Suppose he tried to -
Suppose he went off and left us.
No, he won't.
He likes being with us.
Won't go.
You must have dropped it.
Will he dance all night?
It's all right.
He won't keep you awake.
Can we go on the road?
What road?
Up there.
We found a road.
Didn't he tell you?
What sort of road?
A real road?
Yes.
Is that where we're going tomorrow?
Yes.
I knew we were getting somewhere.
<i>He's not there.</i>
<i>He's not there!</i>
<i>He's not there!</i>
I went to sleep.
He's gone.
Oh.
Where's he gone?
- He's gone home.
- Why?
Well, there was no reason
for him to stay.
He just wanted
to bring us to the road.
We must be near a town.
So he's gone back to his family.
Ahh! Ooh! Ooh!
It's lovely and warm.
- He didn't say good-bye to us.
- Yes, he did.
That's what the dance was about. It's their way
of saying good-bye to people they love.
I'd love to have a warm bath
with clean towels...
and eat with real plates
and knives and forks.
And have proper sheets...
and records.
And clean my teeth properly...
and wear all my own clothes.
I'm glad I washed your things.
We want to look nice
when they find us.
Did you keep that button?
We must be near somewhere
if there's a road.
I wanted to give him my penknife.
He's dead.
How?
I tried to give him my penknife,
but he wouldn't take it.
That doesn't mean that he's dead.
He won't take it.
Should I see if the road's still there?
No, of course it's there.
Did you eat your breakfast properly?
Yes.
You should always sit down
when you eat.
You shouldn't wander about.
You ready then?
There you are.
What are you thinking?
Shall we sit down for a bit?
Stop sulking.
Where's the radio?
You forgot it.
So what?
It didn't work.
<i>It's time now for Hospital Requests.</i>
<i>You're listening
to the first network of the ABC...</i>
<i>Radio 2BL Sydney, 2FC Newcastle.</i>
<i>The time is half past 8:00.</i>
- Look!
- I know.
- Will Dad be there?
- No.
Ow!
Is he dead too?
I'm not sure.
Did he shoot himself?
It was an accident.
No, it wasn't.
- Then I don't know.
- Look.
- Did it hurt?
- Not much.
Well, why did he?
I suppose he thought
he was doing the best thing.
Well, that's silly.
I said I don't know, didn't I?
All right?
- You ready?
- Yes.
- What's the name of that town?
- I don't know.
Morning.
Wait here. Hello?
Uh, excuse me!
Hello?
Hello?
I say, hello?
- Hello?
- Yes?
I'm sorry to trouble you.
We're lost.
We've had an accident in the desert.
Would you mind if -
- Put that down! Put that down!
- Please.
Put it down! Put that down!
- I have.
- This is all private property.
All this is private.
I'm an employee of the company.
- They own all this and the mine.
- What's the company?
You touch their cans
and you'll soon find out.
- Where's the mine?
- It's shut.
- Oh? What was in it?
- Nothing. That's why they shut it.
Do people come through here?
- We get the tourists, same as anyone.
- When will they -
I don't know.
They never send me a card.
- Well, how often do they usually -
- I don't know. You'll have to wait.
- You'll find it down the road.
- What?
Where you're staying.
Don't touch anything.
Would you like to see
the rest of the town?
We shan't have to wait long.
Someone will come soon.
Can we go and see the mines?
Yes, if you like.
- Can I go and play?
- Yes. Don't go far.
- Be careful.
- I'll be all right.
- What's there?
- Nothing.
- Hey!
- Yes?
Watch!
What?
Watch!
- Are you watching?
- Yes.
Well?
- What shall we do now?
- I know. Let's -
Hi, doll.
Well, they've made a decision.
I get Graham's job when he leaves Friday,
Ian takes over mine...
and Robby and Alan go over to Accounts.
Which means old Mel
looks like being out of a job.
Still, it's his own fault.
If you're gonna -
What?
Nothing.
Of course, with all this changing around...
there's bound to be good news
as far as salary's concerned.
I tell you, doll, in two years,
we'll be holidaying on the Gold Coast...
and shopping -
<i>"Into my heart an air that kills...</i>
<i>"from yon far country blows.</i>
<i>"What are those blue remembered hills?</i>
<i>"What spires, what farms are those?</i>
<i>"That is the land of lost content.</i>
<i>"I see it shining plain.</i>
<i>"The happy highways where I went...</i>
<i>and cannot come again."</i>
