Why do they always put braces on
teenage girls at the exact moment...
they're most self-conscious
about their appearance?
I don't know.
<i>- Tom.
- I see him.</i>
<i>- Tom!
- Jesus!</i>
Tom!
Hello, Amy.
Hi, Darryl.
Amy, would you tell the kids
you'll be right back...
and shut the door and step outside
and talk to us for a minute?
Okay.
- Be right back, you guys.
- You're not supposed to go out, Amy.
She's goin' to smoke
a cigarette.
Rudy, come on.
I'm really late. Come on.
- How was school?
- Stupid.
Why do you say that?
We're supposed to write a story
for English homework,
but they didn't tell us
what it's supposed to be about.
Well, what do you mean?
I mean, they didn't tell us
what it's supposed to be about.
- They said do whatever you want.
- Well, what's wrong with that?
I don't know. I just think
it's unstructured.
Well, I'm sure you'll
think of something.
If you can't, I'll help you.
Okay. Here.
Don't forget your backpack.
It's not a backpack.
It's a knapsack.
Well, then don't forget
the knapsack.
Hey. Give me a hug.
Okay.
<i>Somebody somewhere</i>
<i>Don't know what he's missin'</i>
<i>Tonight</i>
<i>It must have all started</i>
<i>With that darn
old late show</i>
<i>It made me so lonely</i>
<i>And sad</i>
<i>- Guess who's been askin' for you?
- Oh, no. Really?</i>
- Is that his car?
- Oh, yeah.
<i>- Yeah, come in.
- Mr. Everett.</i>
- Oh, yeah. Brian.
- Brian, hi.
I'm Samantha Ann Prescott.
I'm the lending officer.
Yeah, hi. Hi.
How are you?
<i>- Have a seat.
- I am so sorry I was late.</i>
<i>- Yeah, we missed you before.
- I got held up.</i>
It... Believe me,
it's nothing I make a habit of.
I'm sure it's not.
Actually, would you mind... Would you
get that door for me, please?
<i>- Thanks.
- Sure.</i>
I always run out at 3:15 to meet him
and run over to the sitter's house.
<i>Anyway, Larry never seemed
to mind about it,</i>
so I was hoping you'd feel
the same way about it too.
Well, Samantha,
I realize that Scottsville is not
exactly a major banking center.
- No, it's not.
- No, I know it's not.
<i>But it's kind of a personal
challenge for me...</i>
to see what we can do to
bring local service up...
<i>to the kind of standards
that we would be trying to meet...</i>
<i>if we were the biggest
branch in the state.</i>
Now, that means I don't want anybody
running out at 3:15 or 3:30...
<i>or whenever the bus happens
to come in that day.</i>
Is there anybody else who can
pick your son up after school?
<i>- Does your husband work in the area?
- Uh, no.</i>
Rudy Sr. isn't on the scene,
so to speak.
Well, I can give you a few days to
make some other arrangement, but...
<i>Well... Brian,</i>
I understand what you're saying
and I think it's great.
<i>Because there are a lot of things
here that can use some attention.</i>
But I've-I've been meeting this bus
every day for three years now.
It really does...
It just takes 15 minutes.
And if I take the time
out of my lunch hour...
Well, I'd prefer if you made
some other arrangement, okay?
I'll do my best.
So, how old's your son?
Uh, he's eight.
Ah. That's a terrific age.
<i>Got a letter from Uncle Terry.</i>
What?
What room is he gonna stay in?
Well, he can stay
in the living room.
And you know what?
He's not gonna live here.
He's only coming to stay here
for a little while.
And it's okay if
you don't remember him,
because you were only six
the last time he was here.
But, um, I think it's...
it'll be nice if you guys...
have a chance
to get to know each other.
Don't you think?
Hey, Rudy, would it distract you
if I put on some music?
No.
- Did you think of a story?
- Uh-huh.
- What's it about?
- My father.
What about...
What about your father?
It's just a made-up story
about him.
Can I read it when you're done?
It's not very good.
Don't say that.
Anyway, Bob, it's kind of
this adventure story.
Rudy's father is a secret agent...
or something, you know,
working for the government.
And it made me feel
kind of weird.
I never say much
to him about Rudy Sr.,
because I don't know
what to say.
And I don't know
if I should just let him...
imagine what he wants
to imagine,
or if I should
sit him down sometime...
and tell him that his father's
not such a nice person.
Well, I don't know, Sammy.
What have you told him already?
Not much.
He knows...
He knows I don't have
the highest opinion of him,
and he knows that
I don't want to see him...
and I don't want to know
anything about him...
and I don't want to have
anything to do with him ever.
But I've... tried
to keep it kind of neutral.
Anyway, I could go
into a lot more detail...
No, it's an interesting problem.
I don't know what to tell you.
It's a little outside
my personal field of expertise.
All right.
I'd be glad
to give it some thought.
Okay.
What?
No, nothing.
I'm just glad to see you.
I'm glad you called me.
I bet you were surprised.
Yeah, a little.
- I should get going.
- Really?
- Yeah, I have the baby-sitter.
- Oh.
But thanks for a lovely evening.
Oh, thank you.
<i>- Hey.
- Hey, Terry.</i>
<i>- Where'd you get that hat?
- On the street for a dollar.</i>
It's nice.
Well, you know, it's pretty much
your standard woolen hat.
I had a very similar
reaction to it.
Uh...
- Um, can I get that money from you?
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Is that all you have?
Yeah.
Can you borrow some more
from your brother?
Well, that would involve
speaking to him.
Well, I'm definitely gonna be gone
for a couple of days, Sheila.
<i>Why do you have to stay
for so long?</i>
Because my sister is not a bank,
okay? I can't just show up...
- You're saying my brother's a bank.
- Can we cut the puerile crap?
I'm gonna be back
as soon as I can, okay?
I am not the kind of guy
that everyone says I am.
I know you're not.
Okay, uh...
<i>I'll call you tonight.</i>
Don't you wanna tell me
that you love me?
I love you.
That was really convincing.
Well, I think
after this is over,
you should seriously consider
moving back home.
Yeah.
<i>- All right.
- So you'll call me tonight?</i>
Definitely, yeah.
<i>I'm gonna wipe these teardrops
from my eyes</i>
<i>There ain't no use
for me to cry</i>
<i>And there's some things
I think I need to say</i>
Hello? Terry!
- Whoa. That's me.
- Terry.
- Terry Prescott.
- That's right.
Well, give me a cuddle. How are you
doing? Good to see you, man.
- You too. How you doing, Darryl?
- Where have you been?
Ah, man, I've been
all over the place.
- Which way you headed?
- I'm goin' up to see Sammy.
- Can I walk with you a bit?
- Yeah, yeah.
- So she said you'd been to Alaska?
- Yeah, yeah.
How you doing, Mr. Parker?
Good to see you. Yeah, take care.
- Were you working up there?
- Yeah, yeah.
<i>Sammy says she was gettin' postcards
from all across the country.</i>
Oh, yeah.
I've been all over, man.
It's good to have you back here,
I'll tell you that.
Oh, thanks, Darryl.
I'll see ya.
Keep enforcing the peace.
It'll be a little harder now that
you're here, but I'll do what I can.
- No, man, I'm reformed.
- Oh, yeah.
- All right, I'll see you around.
- All right.
- Don't be a stranger, all right?
- Take care.
- Sorry about yesterday.
- I don't care.
I was studying the bus description,
and I got on the wrong bus.
- I missed my stop.
- I don't care, Terry.
I'm so glad to see you.
I'm glad to see you too, Sammy.
Um, so, you're coming from work?
Uh... No, it's Saturday.
Yeah. No, it's just
you're dressed so formally.
Oh. No. You know,
I thought I'd...
I thought it was
a special occasion, which it is.
It's good. No, it's good.
- I thought I'd get dressed up too.
- It's okay. You look fine.
Yeah, yeah. This is
the haute cuisine of garments.
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.
So, how are you?
I'm fine, Terry.
So, um... Oh, how's Rudy?
We're fine, Terry.
How are you?
- Uh, yeah.
- Where have you been lately, Terry?
Uh, I know I haven't been...
I got a postcard
from you from Alaska.
Yeah, yeah. I was out there
for a little while.
- That was in the fall, Terry.
- I know. I've been out of touch.
- I was a little worried.
- I've been to a lot of places.
I was down in Florida
for a little while.
I was doing some work
in Orlando.
Man, I've been
all over the place.
Well, I wish you'd had just
let me know you were okay.
Yeah, I didn't realize
it had been so long.
You staying in town for a while?
Well, I don't know.
I got all these things
I gotta do back in Worcester.
Oh.
So I'm probably not gonna be able
to stay for more than a day or so.
Oh.
I mean, I'm trying to keep
to a schedule of sorts.
Oh. That's...
I just... That's all right.
It's a very worthy story, but I
won't trouble you with it right now.
Are you expecting someone?
Who would I be expecting here?
You just keep looking
around, that's all.
I was just wondering if we could get
some more refreshments, actually.
I actually gotta
confess to you, Sammy.
<i>The reason that you may not
have heard from me for a while...</i>
is that...
I've been unable to write on
the account of the fact that...
I was in jail
for a little while.
You were what?
I served a little time, I guess,
down in Florida.
- It was just for bullshit.
- What? What did you do?
I didn't do anything. Does it occur
to you that maybe I was wronged?
- No! Oh, my God!
- Well... Would you please...
- Let me tell you what happened.
- What happened?
I got into a fight
in a bar down in Florida...
which I was not
the one who instigated it at all.
Then they worked up
all this bullshit against me...
<i>and threw me in the pen
for three months.</i>
<i>I didn't write you 'cause I didn't
want you to get all upset about it.</i>
I just figured you would figure I
was on the road for a little while.
<i>It was stupid. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you worry.</i>
You wanna know what?
I can't run around doin' stuff...
or not doin' stuff
because it's gonna make you worry.
<i>Because then I come back here,
I tell you about my fucking traumas,</i>
and I get this "I've let you down"
bullshit over and over again.
It just cramps me.
I just wanna get out from under it.
And now I'm back in this fuckin'
hole explaining myself to you again.
- Please stop cursing at me.
- I realize I'm in no position...
to basically say anything ever,
but it's not like I'm down there
in some redneck bar in Florida,
<i>I'm having an argument with
some stripper's boyfriend...</i>
and suddenly say to myself,
"Hey, this would be a great time...
to stick it to Sammy and get myself
locked up for a few months. "
You don't write me for six months.
- I don't know where you are!
- I'm sorry.
I don't know if
you're alive or dead!
- I'm sorry.
- Then you show up out of nowhere...
- and tell me you were in jail?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Sammy.
I'm really sorry.
Sammy...
What?
- I'm in a slight predicament.
- What do you need, money?
- Um, yeah.
- Mmm.
I'm broke.
I gotta get back
to Worcester tomorrow.
I got this girl there,
and she's kind of in
a bad situation.
So I just need
to borrow some money.
Whatever you can spare.
I'll pay you back, man.
- I'll pay you back.
- I just...
I really wish Mom was here.
<i>- So do I, man.
- No one knows what to do with you.</i>
I know how they feel, man.
Terry, can I ask you a question?
Sure.
I mean...
Do you ever go
to church anymore?
Come on, Sammy.
Can we not talk about that shit?
- Do you?
- Um, no, Sammy, I don't.
- Can you tell me why not?
- Because I think it's ridiculous.
Well, can you tell me without,
like, degrading what I believe in?
I think it's primitive, okay?
I think it's a fairy tale.
Well, have you ever considered
that maybe that's part...
of what's making things
so difficult for you?
- No.
- That you've lost hold...
of not just
your religious feeling,
but lost hold of
any kind of anchor.
I mean, any kind
of trust in anything.
No wonder you drift around so much.
What's to stop you?
How would you ever know
if you found the right thing?
I'm not really looking
for anything, man.
I'm just, like,
trying to get on with it.
<i>Here we go.</i>
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thanks, Sammy.
I'm really gonna pay you back.
- Where we goin'?
- Pick up Rudy.
Well, do you not even want me
to visit now?
I can catch the bus at 5:00,
if that's what you want.
Of course I want you
to visit, you idiot!
I've been looking forward
to seeing you more than anything.
I told everybody I know
that you were coming home.
I cleaned the whole fucking house
so it would look nice for you.
I thought you'd stay
at least a few days.
I had no idea that
you were just broke again.
I wish you'd just
send me an invoice!
Hi, is that... Is that Malcom?
Uh, hi.
This is...
This is Terry Prescott.
I'm trying to get ahold
of Sheila,
and the phone isn't picking up.
I was wondering if maybe
you guys...
<i>She what?</i>
Well, is she all right?
Uh...
<i>Can I...
Can I talk to her, please?</i>
Okay.
Um, then can you please
give her a message...
and tell her that I...
That girl I'm with
tried to kill herself.
- What?
- She tried to kill herself.
<i>- Do you have everything you need?
- I think so.</i>
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Just send her the money, I guess.
Maybe you should stay home
for a while.
Yeah, maybe that'd be
a good idea.
<i>This 15-year-old says she's sick of
her brother trying to control her.</i>
<i>She's dropped out of school,
she's doing drugs...</i>
<i>and says there's
nothing he can do about it.</i>
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>
Do you have everything you need?
Oh, yeah, thanks.
Good night.
Good night.
Terry...
I'm really glad you're home.
Yeah, me too, Sammy.
Okay.
So we'll drop Rudy off
at the bus,
and then all you have to do
is drop me off at the bank...
and then pick Rudy up at 3:30
and drive him over to Carol's house.
And that's it.
She lives on Harvey Lane...
right past where
the DeWitts used to live.
Okay.
Rudy knows where she lives.
Okay.
<i>God, Mabel, don't those colors
hurt your eyes?</i>
Oh, no.
It keeps me fresh.
<i>Yeah?</i>
Oh. Hi, Sammy.
What can I do for you?
Um, Brian, did you want us
to hand these time sheets in...
at the... at the end of the day
or at the end of the week?
Uh, yeah.
End of the day will be fine.
It just seems like an awful lot
of extra paperwork.
I like paperwork.
- You showed up.
- Looks that way.
Put on your seat belt.
- It pushes on my neck.
- What?
It pushes on my neck.
It's uncomfortable.
When someone slams into us and you
go sailin' through the windshield,
that's liable to be
uncomfortable too.
Now put on your seat belt.
Mom's parents died
in a car accident.
Yeah, I know.
They're my parents too.
- They are?
- Yeah.
- Your mom's my sister.
- Yeah, I know.
- So that means we have the
same parents. - Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Um, Carol just called.
She said that Terry and Rudy
never showed up at her house.
You've gotta be kidding.
<i>These have to be filed by number...
by the account number,</i>
not alphabetically.
Sammy? Sammy!
Hey.
What are you doin'?
Look.
If you hold it further down, you're
gonna get a lot more power on that.
You should be able to hit that nail
in in two or three hits.
Look.
See?
- Go ahead, try it.
- That's not the way I hold it.
Well, the way
you hold it is wrong.
Why can't I just
hold it my own way?
You can.
<i>One there, one there,
and one there.</i>
<i>All right?
You got that?</i>
All right. Good.
That's it.
Um...
Brian, did you wanna see me?
Yeah. Yeah, I was kind of wondering
what happened to you today.
Didn't Mabel tell you I had
a false alarm about my son?
Yeah, well, I kind of thought
you were gonna work that out.
<i>Well, I did work it out,
more or less.</i>
Then what are you doing leaving here
in the middle of the day...
without so much as a word
of explanation to me, Sammy?
<i>- Brian, don't yell at me.
- I'm not yelling at you. I'm just...</i>
- I'm getting a little frustrated.
- Well...
I'm sorry. Would you
close the door, please?
And Eddie Dwyer lives in Buffalo
with his wife and two kids,
<i>- if you can believe it.
- That's depressing.</i>
- Why?
- He just never struck me...
as the marrying type.
- Who are you talking about?
- Some wild kids we used to know.
- Were you a wild kid?
- Not as wild as your mom.
- Yeah, right.
- You don't believe me?
- No.
- Ask her.
Mom, were you?
No comment.
What are you doing?
Oh. Just reading
some of your compositions.
Why are you smoking?
Um, because it's bad.
Don't ever do it.
I won't.
You know this used to be
my room?
Yeah.
Do you want it back?
No.
<i>- Did you fight in Vietnam?
- No, I wasn't even born yet.</i>
<i>- Were you ever in the army?
- No.</i>
My father was in the army.
I know. Unfortunately,
he didn't fight in Vietnam either.
Were you friends with him?
Not really.
I mean,
we had some friends
in common, I guess.
<i>- I didn't like him very much.
- Why not?</i>
<i>- Well, he wasn't very likable.
- Why do you say that?</i>
<i>I don't know.
He was always, like...</i>
He always had to be better than
you at everything, you know?
Like, if you were all
playing basketball or something,
everybody's having
a friendly game,
he's ready to kill somebody
if his team didn't win.
Or, if you told a joke or a story,
he always had to tell a better one.
Kind of gets annoying
after a while.
Plus, I thought it was pretty scummy
how he split on you and your mom.
He was a prick.
He's probably still a prick.
<i>Fortunately for you, though,
your mom is, like, the greatest.</i>
So you had some bad luck...
and you had some good luck.
You mind if I ask you
a personal question?
I don't know.
Do you like it here?
I mean, in Scottsville?
- Yeah.
- Why?
I don't know.
My friends are here,
I like the scenery. I don't know.
I know, I know. It's just so...
There's nothing to do here.
- Yes, there is.
- No, there isn't, man.
It's narrow, it's dull.
It's a dull, narrow town
full of dull, narrow people...
who don't know anything except what
things are like right around here.
They have no perspective whatsoever.
No scope.
<i>They might as well be living in
the 19th century,</i>
because they have no idea
what's going on.
And if you try and tell 'em that,
they wanna fuckin' kill you.
What are you talking about?
I have no idea.
You're a good kid.
Yeah, this doesn't apply
to you, Sammy,
but I've noticed that
some of the employees...
are setting their PC monitors
to all kinds of crazy colors.
Purple, polka dot,
what have you.
And it's no big deal, but...
I mean, this is a bank, you know?
It's really not appropriate.
So I'm asking that people
use a more...
"normal range of colors"
in the future.
But like I said,
this doesn't really apply to you.
No, my computer palette's
pretty conservative.
Bob Steegerson.
What are you wearing?
Mom?
<i>- What's up?
- Do you know that you have...</i>
<i>an enormous leak coming from
the upstairs hallway here?</i>
Yeah, I did.
Are you guys sure
you're gonna be okay?
- Yes, yes.
- What is happening here?
It's just the problem is, the pipes
are corroded the length of the hall.
<i>So every time I put a new piece in,
it starts leaking further down.</i>
Why don't I
just call the plumber.
Why? He's not gonna do anything
different than what I'm doing.
- Yeah, we're only making it worse.
- No, we're not.
Shut up.
Thanks.
Thank you.
So call if there are
any problems.
If I'm not there, I'm either
on my way back home or on my way.
Okay.
Nice to meet you, Bob.
Yeah, you too.
So, lights out at 10:00, and don't
spend the whole night watching TV.
What's your idea
of the whole night?
Two hours, tops.
This kid is a sure
bet to lead the way...
for the next generation
of California surfers.
What's your feeling about Bob?
I don't really know him
that well.
Well, I got bad news for you.
No.
Great. Now what are we
supposed to do?
- You know how to play pool?
- I've played it.
I don't think
they let kids in here.
What?
I don't think
they let kids in here.
Well, we're not allowed to watch any
more TV, so it's this or nothing.
But if we get into any trouble,
you let me do the talking, okay?
Okay.
Uh, I got 100 bucks here...
says me and my nephew
can beat anybody in here.
Only we gotta get the next game.
He's gotta be in bed by 10:00.
Just hit it nice and soft.
Nice and soft.
One, two, three.
- Sorry.
- Goddamn, Rudy.
I thought you said
you could play.
Boys, it's all over
but the cryin'.
Bob, are you... are you serious?
Yeah.
I... I-I-I don't know
what to say.
Sammy, I mean, I, um...
Look, I... I know that, um,
I haven't been the most, um,
decisive guy in the past.
But I don't know.
I am tired of fooling around.
And I love you.
I, I'm totally...
I, I, I don't know
what to say.
You could always say yes,
or you could think about it
some more.
- Would you like to think about it?
- Yeah, that's it.
- I wanna think about it.
- Okay.
All right.
Fair enough.
Ahh.
<i>She's strange</i>
<i>She's strange</i>
<i>She looks so sweet
she can make you weak</i>
<i>She's strange</i>
<i>And she's long</i>
<i>She's long</i>
It's all yours, baby.
Just make sure to hit it
really gentle, but firm.
And hit it a little low
so you get some back spin.
Okay?
Don't even hit it.
Just kiss it.
- What do you mean, kiss it?
- I mean, tap it.
Firm but very, very softly.
And don't take the shot until you
know you're gonna make it, okay?
Okay.
We creamed those guys.
We creamed them.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Don't move, don't move.
Let's go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
What is going on here?
We were out doing
some stargazing...
and Rudy lost track of time,
which I totally
warned him about.
You are a bad kid.
Hey, I think it's okay.
Just don't tell her where we went,
'cause she'll be
really mad at me, okay?
- I won't.
- Hey.
- I mean it, Rudy. I'm not kidding.
- I won't.
Did you know...
my mommy used to take me
and Uncle Terry out at night...
- to look at the constellations?
- Yeah.
Did you see that one...
Oh, what's the one...
It looks like a big "W. "
- Cassiopeia?
- Yeah.
Ow! Shit!
I've got a great idea.
Why don't I call a plumber?
- Do whatever you want.
- Oh, what? That makes you mad?
- No.
- Ow!
- I'm sorry.
- Geez.
Brian, get off my ass.
- Excuse me?
- I did not change the colors...
<i>- on your stupid computer screen.
- Then that's all you gotta say.</i>
<i>There's nothing wrong
with the work I do here.</i>
- I didn't say there was.
- I was doing just fine before you.
And if you think that riding people
in this petty, ridiculous way...
is gonna improve service
at this bank or anywhere else,
- Can I please...
- you're out of your mind.
- May I respond?
- No, that's all I have to say.
May I respond? First of all,
I would appreciate it...
if you would not use that language
when you're speaking to me.
<i>I don't talk to you that way.</i>
I would appreciate it if you didn't
talk to me that way. Second...
if you tell me that you
didn't change the colors...
of my computer screen, then of
course I accept your answer.
But you and I are gonna have to
find a way to work together,
and that's not gonna happen with
the attitude, with the lateness...
I do not have an attitude
and I am not late!
Okay, not you.
You're not late personally.
- Then don't say I'm late if I'm not.
- I would like to finish.
- Hey, Sammy.
- Hey, Darryl.
They were where?
<i>Her brother tries to discipline
her, but he works nights.</i>
Okay, you're all set.
Dave, uh, my wife, Nancy.
- Hello.
- Hi.
And, uh, Mabel.
- This is my wife, Nancy. Mabel.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.
- And Chuck.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
This is Sammy,
our lending officer.
- Sammy, this is my wife, Nancy.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
Brian, I gotta sit down.
Yeah, sure.
Let's go into my office.
- I can give you a ride home.
- I'm fine.
- Brian?
- Yeah?
Mom.
<i>Rudy!</i>
Look. I-I am really glad that you
guys are getting along so well,
like you have no idea.
But If I can't rely on you
to get him once a day...
- You can!
- What are you doing taking him...
to play pool
in the middle of the night...
and then telling him
to lie to me about it?
- I don't know.
- God!
- Get out of the car.
- What are we doing?
You're going to Carol's
and I'm going home.
- Why can't I come with you?
- Because if you're such a baby...
that you've gotta tell your mommy
about us playing pool...
when I totally asked you not to...
Now I got to listen
to her shit all day.
Then you're going to the baby-sitter
so you can stay at the baby house.
- But I didn't...
- You know what?
- Don't even fuckin' talk to me.
- I didn't.
Get out.
You're working late.
How'd your wife like the bank?
Oh, fine.
She wasn't feeling so great.
- Oh, that's too bad.
- No, I don't mean...
She's not ill.
She just... I don't know.
- Pregnant?
- Yeah, that's right. She's pregnant.
Well, it can make you
kind of cranky.
<i>Yeah.</i>
Look, I'm sorry that we've been
stepping on each other's toes.
- Yeah, so am I.
- I'm really not that bad a guy.
I know you're not, Brian,
but you're driving everybody crazy.
Well, I'm trying to do
my best here.
- And I'm getting it from all sides.
- I know you are.
Anyway, we'll work it out.
Well... I could use a beer.
I could use a tranquilizer.
<i>Last I heard, Rudy's dad
was living in Auburn,</i>
but that was a year ago.
That must be so tough trying
to raise a kid on your own.
I'm starting to think my wife
wouldn't mind a crack at it.
Oh.
It's just hormones.
Well, no.
It isn't. But never mind.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
Well,
here's to improved
employee-management relations.
Amen.
You know, you can't judge...
all of Scottsville by the people
in that bank, believe me.
Well, let's, um...
- Let's not talk about the bank.
- Okay.
Let's just forget about
the bank for tonight.
Good idea.
- Sammy?
- Yeah?
I want you to tell me who changed
the colors on my computer screen.
I'll never tell.
<i>Where were you?</i>
Nowhere.
I had dinner with my boss.
- Kind of a late dinner, ain't it?
- Yeah.
- How is Rudy?
- Fine. He's asleep.
<i>- Did the plumber come?
- Yeah, the fucking plumber came.</i>
<i>Terry, just give me a break!</i>
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing!
I'm... I'm just tired.
Wanna smoke some pot?
No, I don't.
Why, you got some?
So... Bob asked me to marry him.
- Wow. What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.
If he'd asked me the same time last
year, I probably would've said yes.
But I don't know.
The minute he asked me,
it was like someone
was trying to strangle me.
Whoa. Bad sign.
Yeah, I know.
Plus...
Terry, I fucked my boss.
- What?
- I know.
I know his wife
is six months pregnant.
- Jesus Christ, Sammy!
- I know, I know.
Um...
I'm sorry I got so mad
at you before. I just...
- It's cool.
- I just don't want him to be scared.
I really don't think
that's his problem, Sammy.
No? What...
What do you think his problem is?
Well, I think his problem is
that he's totally sheltered.
I mean, you treat the kid like he's
three, so that's how he behaves.
Uh-huh. Well, how do you
think he should behave?
Well, I don't think he should have
to run and tell Mommy every time...
he does something she might not
approve of, for one thing.
- Uh-huh.
- I mean, I took him to play pool.
It was a little clandestine
thing we did for fun.
It wasn't a big secret.
I mean, who cares?
I was actually trying
to be nice to him.
But he's so freaked out that
he disobeyed your orders...
that he's got to fucking squeal on
me and I gotta listen to your shit.
- And I didn't fucking do anything.
- Okay.
First of all, he didn't say
anything, Darryl did. Okay?
And second of all,
I don't give a shit...
if you take him out
to play pool.
I was mad at you because you left
him at the bus stop in the rain.
But no, I don't want you
telling him not to squeal...
because I don't want him
put in that position.
Well, that...
is a perfect example
of what I'm talking about.
You are an idiot.
- Are you saying Darryl told you?
- Yes!
<i>- Good morning.
- Yeah, good morning.</i>
<i>Could you shut the door, please?</i>
Brian, I just want to...
Brian?
That's enough.
- You're awfully quiet.
- Sorry.
So have you thought at all
about what I said?
Well... sure,
I've been thinking about it.
So any decisions, or...
Do-Do you want to
think about it some more?
I don't know, Bob.
It's not like we've been going
steady for the last few months.
- Yeah. No, I know.
- And we see each other twice,
and then you suddenly say
you want to get married?
<i>- No, you're right. You're right.
- I mean,</i>
what are you talking about?
I, I don't know.
I, um...
Last year, I...
I thought that maybe
you were possibly...
<i>interested in that idea.</i>
But I was the one who wasn't ready,
you know, at that point,
so that's why I sort of thought
things slowed down with us.
Don't make me feel bad for you.
I don't want you
to feel bad for me.
<i>Yeah?
Well, where were you last night?</i>
- Hello.
- This is Brian.
Brian, where are you?
I'm buying milk.
Just thought I'd say hello.
Look, I know it's
probably too late, but...
is there any way you can come out
for a little while?
Brian, I think
you're going crazy.
I know I am.
Can you meet me?
Um...
Okay.
<i>Um, I have to go out for a little
while. Do you want anything?</i>
Like what?
- I don't know.
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, where are you going?
- I just have to go out for a while.
- Where?
- Yeah, where?
I'm going to Mabel's house.
Why?
You know what, Rudy?
It's personal.
It's... It's a personal matter...
<i>that has to do with Mabel,
and I just have to go...</i>
see her for a little while.
Listen.
Listen, I'm sorry I said
you squealed on me.
I was totally out of line,
and I really owe you an apology.
- Did you hear me?
- I don't care.
<i>I'd like to introduce myself.</i>
<i>I'm the other woman</i>
<i>The other woman</i>
<i>In your husband's life</i>
<i>Now everybody's
blaming me</i>
<i>I'm the other woman</i>
<i>But who are they to judge</i>
<i>Who's wrong or right</i>
<i>Their whispers might be
different</i>
Oh!
Oh!
Oh-ho. Oh.
Oh.
What's on your mind, Sammy?
Well, a lot.
But principally, I was just
wondering if-if you had an opinion.
If you know someone
in your family...
or even just someone
who you really care about...
and they just can't quite
get ahold of themselves.
Ah! Guess who
these are for?
- Me!
- That's right, my little friend.
Hello.
We're going fishing.
I got a new rod and reel,
five lures,
a hat, a knife
and a fish scaler.
<i>That's great, sweetie.</i>
I'll get it.
Well, I'm not really sure
why you're here, Ron.
Um, I know I haven't exactly been
the model citizen since I got here.
But considering how things
have been going for me lately,
I thought I was doing
pretty well.
I also find it kind of discouraging
that you seem to think that...
I'm in need of some sort of
spiritual guidance or what have you.
So much so, that you're willing
to disregard the fact...
that I don't believe
in any of this stuff at all.
- I didn't mean to discourage you.
- I find it insulting.
Can I... Can I say something here?
Sammy asked me to come talk to you
because it's her opinion...
that you're not gonna find
what you're looking for...
the way you're looking for it.
- And how would she know?
- I'm really not here...
to try to get you to do anything
or believe in anything.
To try to get you to do anything
or believe in anything.
<i>And I'll tell you the same thing
I told her,</i>
<i>which is that as far as I'm
concerned, the only way...</i>
she can help you is by her example,
by trying to be a model for you...
<i>in the way she lives her life.</i>
And that doesn't mean that she's
supposed to be a saint either,
if that's what
you're smiling about.
I didn't realize I was smiling.
You know, a lot of people come to
see me with all kinds of problems...
<i>drugs, alcohol, marital problems,
sexual problems...</i>
- Good job you have, man.
- Well, I like it.
<i>Because even in this little town,
I really feel like...</i>
what I do is very connected with
the real center of people's lives.
<i>I'm not saying
I'm always Mr. Effective,</i>
<i>but I don't feel like my life is off
to the side of what's important.</i>
<i>I don't feel that
my happiness and comfort...</i>
are based on closing my eyes to
trouble in myself or other people.
<i>I don't feel like
a negligible little scrap...</i>
<i>floating around in some kind
of empty void...</i>
<i>with no sense of connectedness
to anything around me...</i>
except by virtue of whatever
little philosophies...
I can scrape together on my own.
Well...
Can I ask you, Terry... Do you
think your life is important?
Um, you mean like... me personally,
like my individual life?
Yeah.
Mmm... I'm not really sure.
What do you mean?
I mean, it's important
to me, I guess,
and like, to, you know,
other people who care about me.
But do you think it's important?
I...
Do you think it's important
in the scheme of things...
not just because it's yours or
because you're somebody's brother.
Because I really don't get
the impression that you do.
I don't think that anybody's life
has any particular importance...
besides... whatever, you know... like
whatever we arbitrarily give it.
Which is fine.
I mean, you know, we might as well.
I think my life is as important
as anybody else's.
I don't know, Ron.
A lot of what you're saying
has real appeal to me.
You know, the stuff they told us
when we were kids.
But... I don't want to
believe in something...
or not believe in it
because I might feel bad.
I want to believe in it or not
because I think it's true or not.
Yeah, I mean, I want to think
that my life is important.
That it's connected
to something important.
Is there any way for you to believe
that without calling it God...
<i>or a religion or whatever term
it is that you object to?</i>
Yeah, I believe that.
So Sammy, what example will you
be setting for us tonight?
What time are we getting up
to go fishing?
We're not going fishing.
- What do you mean?
- Why not?
I think you should go fishing
with Father Ron.
I don't want to go fishing
with Father Ron.
Well, I'm not going to take you.
I'll take you, sweetie.
- I realize that you're mad at me.
- I'm not mad at you.
But he didn't do
anything to you.
And you cannot promise
a little boy...
After that religious conversation,
I realized it's probably...
not so good for him to be spending
so much time with someone...
who doesn't believe his life is
important in the scheme of things.
- Would you please.
- I'm serious.
Listen.
I am sure if you put
your mind to it,
you can think of some other way
of getting back at me besides this.
So would you please
just give it some thought...
and take him fishing tomorrow?
I would, Sammy, but I really
don't think it's good for him.
You suck!
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You remember my wife, Nancy.
- Oh, yes. Nice to see you.
Father.
Nice job.
Anyway, I don't know what
the church's official position is...
on fornication
and adultery these days.
I felt hypocritical not saying
anything to you about it before,
so... what is the official position
these days?
Well, it's a sin.
- Good. I think it should be.
- But we try not to focus...
on that aspect of it too much
right off the bat.
- Why not? I think you should.
- Well...
<i>Maybe it was better
when you came in here...</i>
and they screamed at you for
having sex with your married boss.
They told you what a terrible thing
it was. They were mean to you.
<i>Ma-Maybe it would be better...</i>
<i>if you told me that I was
endangering my immortal soul,</i>
<i>and that
if-if I don't quit...</i>
I'm gonna burn in hell.
Don't you ever think that?
Um... no.
Well, it would be a lot
better than all this...
"Why do you think you're
in this situation"...
psychological bullshit
you hear all the time.
<i>Well, why do you think
you're in this situation?</i>
With which one?
All of 'em.
I feel sorry for them.
Isn't that ridiculous?
I've never been so bored
in my whole life.
We should've been here
around 7:00, 8:00 a.m.
What time is it now?
2:30.
Was my father a good fisherman?
Yeah, he was good at all that
stuff, you know?
He knew everything about the woods,
hunting, fishing and cars.
If he wasn't such a pain in the ass,
he would've been fun to be around.
Maybe he's nicer now.
- I doubt it.
- Well, I think he is.
How would you know?
Did you ever meet him?
No.
You ever been curious
about meeting him?
I guess so.
He lives near here.
I thought he lived in Alaska.
No, I lived in Alaska. He lives
in Auburn, as far as I know.
We could look him up
in the phone book.
Wanna try it?
All right.
<i>But Rudy, I'm sure
I don't have to tell you this,</i>
but I'm not kidding, man,
don't tell your mother.
Can I get you something?
Or hey, do you want to go
for a walk... or a drive?
It's really nice out.
No, I'm not gonna stay long.
Bob, I don't want to get married.
Okay.
<i>I've been thinking about it
for a long time,</i>
and if you had asked me
last year,
I'm sure I would have said yes.
Oh. Thank you.
But I don't think it would've been
a good idea then either.
<i>I've been going through a really
hard time lately, and I just...</i>
<i>I think getting engaged to you
or anybody else would be probably...</i>
<i>the stupidest, most self-destructive
thing I could possibly do.</i>
Okay.
And I really think
you need to grow up.
How about we fix my personality
some other time?
Okay.
I really hope
we can still be friends.
Oh. Yes, me too.
Bob!
- Bob.
- What?
- I don't know.
- I don't know. I just... I...
Sammy, I-I love you.
I...
I really...
I love you.
Oh, I love you too.
- Oh, shit!
- What? What?
- I got to go. I'm sorry.
- Where do you have to go?
I have to get Mabel her car.
Now? I don't understand.
<i>How are we leaving things?</i>
I don't know. Call me later.
This is incredible.
Mmm.
That is not what I mean.
<i>I was born on this land</i>
<i>This land is my home</i>
<i>And she rules me
and keeps me</i>
<i>From worry and woe</i>
<i>Well, it took everything</i>
<i>She gave, now they're gone</i>
Maybe we should call first.
Well, we're right here.
<i>Come on.</i>
- There he is.
- His last name is Kolinsky?
Yeah. Come on.
Go ahead, knock.
<i>Out of the yard, and the Mets
add another run to their lead.</i>
<i>It's now 7 to 2, Mets.</i>
- Yes?
- Hi. We're looking for Rudy.
Who should I say is calling?
<i>- Uh, an old friend.
- Who is it?</i>
<i>- He says an old friend.
- How old is he?</i>
- Hey!
- Hey, Rudy.
Hey.
- Hi, I'm Terry.
- Hello.
Uh, this is Rudy.
You don't say.
Rudy, meet Rudy.
I'll just be in the kitchen.
<i>Nice meeting you.
Okay if we come in for a minute?</i>
- What the hell are you doing?
- What do you mean?
- Would you back away from the door?
- Just want to come in...
<i>- Would you back away from the door?
- All right, all right.</i>
What are you doing here?
- Just wanted the kid to see you.
- Now he saw me.
Now you saw me, all right?
Now, do you mind?
- Man, you really...
- I'm trying to be polite, all right?
Would you just take off?
Just take off.
- I just wanna...
- Do you know what you're doing here?
Get out of here, all right?
You know what, man?
You're still a fucking asshole.
I'm an asshole? Get out of here.
Fuckin' asshole!
Get your fuckin' hands off him!
Get off!
Fuckin' woman! Get the fuck...
<i>Hey, break it up!</i>
Listen, Officer, I just came
down here to talk to the guy,
and he starts shovin' me.
- You're not the guardian?
- I don't even know if that's my kid.
<i>Fuckin' lying piece of shit.</i>
<i>He's on our property.
I don't know who this guy is.</i>
We have a right
to protect ourselves.
Listen to 'em. You can hear,
they're out of their minds.
<i>Look at how aggressive he is.
He started the whole thing,</i>
- and now I'm being arrested...
- Stop talkin'.
<i>And what's gonna happen
with him?</i>
- Terry, stop talkin'.
- All right, man.
<i>Any idea where we might
contact his mother?</i>
No, because he's not
my goddamn kid.
<i>- Oh, my gosh.
- What's the matter?</i>
What time is it?
Oh, my God, it's 9:30.
Hey. You know, Nancy's gonna be
gone for the rest of the week.
- Well, Brian.
- Yeah?
I don't mean to be...
Couldn't we just...
I mean, could we give it a rest?
Yeah, sure, if you want to.
I mean, I just think...
I don't know...
we've had a great little
fling, you know.
So why push it?
Is that okay?
I just...
Yeah, sure. Okay.
No, you're right.
- So we're still friends?
- Mm-hmm. Sure.
All right.
Around 2:00 this afternoon.
Yes. A '97 red Subaru Outback.
New York plates. AUZ 416.
Please.
Thanks for coming over. I want
to have a car handy, just in case.
No problem.
<i>Yes! What-What about
other towns?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>
Yes.
<i>I- I've called the Highway
Patrol four times.</i>
What am I supposed
to do all night?
Hello?
Anyone hear from Sammy
this morning?
- I didn't.
- Uh-huh. Well,
if anybody ever hears from her
ever again, would you let me know?
Yes.
- Thanks. I'll give you a call.
- All right.
It's gonna be all right. We got
on the phone with Rudy Sr. A bit,
and he's calmed down.
He wants to forget
the whole thing.
Darryl, I really
appreciate this.
- Hello.
- Yeah, it's Brian.
- Brian.
- What the hell happened to you lady?
- Hello.
- You're fired!
Good!
- Rudy?
- Yeah?
Is there anything
you want to ask me...
about your father?
- Oh, that wasn't my father.
- What?
<i>That wasn't him.
I heard him tell the cops.</i>
No, Rudy, that was him.
I wish it wasn't, but it was.
No, it wasn't.
Yes, Rudy. It was.
Your father's name
is Rudy Kolinsky.
He lives in Auburn.
Would you turn that off, please?
- You don't have to say anything...
- I want you to leave.
What do you mean?
I mean, I don't think
you should live here.
I don't think you know how to behave
around an eight-year-old,
and I don't know how
to make you stop,
so I don't think
you should live here.
I, I don't know
what else to say.
- I don't know how to behave?
- That's right.
I think you don't know how
to behave around an eight-year-old.
Are you out of your mind?
<i>Just listen to me. I may not be
the greatest mother in the world,</i>
but I'm doing the best I know how,
and he doesn't need you...
to rub his face in shit because
you think it's good for him.
He's gonna find out the world
is a horrible place...
and that people suck soon enough,
and without any help from you.
Believe me.
I think... you should
get your own place.
I thought maybe you could...
I, I'd be happy to, to help
you out financially.
- What do you mean, get my own place?
- I mean, I...
- You mean, here, in Scottsville?
- Yes.
Why would I do that?
Why don't I just leave, period.
Well...
If that's what you want to do,
that's fine.
But that's not what I'm saying.
You're a very important
person to Rudy.
And you are the most
important person to me.
But I'm saying,
I can't take any more of this.
- Well...
- And I thought you could sell...
your half of the house to me,
and then I could pay you back
a certain amount,
whatever it is,
over a period of time.
No, you know what? I'll just go.
Well, th-that's not
what I'm saying.
<i>Where are you gonna go?</i>
I don't know. I just want to
get out of this town. And if you...
have any sense when you get old
enough, you'll get out of here too.
Your mom is gonna stay in this town
for the rest of her life. Know why?
Because she thinks she has to.
She thinks there are all these
things that she has to do.
<i>But I'll tell you one thing
about your mom:</i>
She's a bigger fuck-up
than I ever was.
I mean, I know
I messed up, okay?
You think I enjoy
getting thrown in jail?
<i>Because I wanted you to face
that prick like a little man...</i>
and show you what kind
of guy he is?
I got a little carried away.
I know it.
I lost my temper a bit, which is not
the end of the world, either.
Just for future reference.
And now she's gonna throw me
out of my own house because...
you know, because
I fucked up a little bit.
Which I totally admit.
I was, like, totally
ready to admit that.
<i>I could go with you.</i>
Thanks, man, but I, uh...
I can't really take care of you.
Is... Is that for you?
Yeah, I'm just gonna stay
at Ray's till I leave.
- You don't have to do that.
- But that's what I wanna do, so...
Are you gonna come back
and say good-bye?
No, I'm just gonna take off.
See ya.
Well...
Look, I know you're upset about
Uncle Terry leaving, and so am I.
But he is not in control of himself,
and I don't want him hurting...
your feelings anymore, or mine.
You might not like it, but that's
the way it's gonna be, okay?
I don't care.
You don't care?
I don't care either.
Well, I'm sorry...
- you're having all this trouble.
- Thank you.
<i>But you made a good speech to me
the other day about people...</i>
- sticking to their commitments.
- Yeah?
Well, you made a commitment,
Sammy, to this bank.
<i>- To this job.
- I know I did.</i>
And to working things out with this
new son of a bitch boss of yours.
Whatever passed between us after
hours doesn't mean you can just...
walk away from that commitment.
<i>Yeah, even if you have
a legitimate family emergency.</i>
<i>- I'm really sorry I didn't call in.
- That's why I think,</i>
in the calm, cold light of day,
that you and I both have to think
real hard about whether...
you really want to continue on here
at Outpost Bankers Trust.
- You've gotta be kidding.
- You're not happy.
I'm not happy.
It's no good for you.
And it's sure as heck
no good for the bank.
You know, you're the worst manager
we've ever had.
- Come on, Sammy.
- By far, the worst.
- I don't want to trade insults.
- I don't want to be fired.
- I've been working here seven years.
- Well...
If I were you, I'd be
a little nervous firing...
an employee I just had
an affair with, okay?
What... Don't... Don't threaten me.
- I'm not threatening you.
- I'm not threatening you.
I just... I think it's
an area we oughta explore.
<i>You explore it.
I'm going back to work.</i>
<i>Oh, and I have to pick up Rudy today
because no one else can do it.</i>
I'll find someone else
when I have time.
Oh, yeah. Fine. Why don't you
just take over the whole bank?
Well...
I called Uncle Terry
where he said he'd be staying,
<i>but there was no answer.</i>
So...
<i>I don't know if he's
still in town or not.</i>
Rudy, you're not speaking to me?
I'm really sorry
you're so mad at me,
but I only did
what I thought I had to do.
And I just hope you don't stay mad
at me for the rest of your life.
Rudy, that's enough.
Rudy!
<i>- Now you gotta cut this out!
- What did I do?</i>
You don't know what
you're talking about.
There was nothing else I could do.
I don't know how...
to explain it to you
any better than that.
You cannot go on this way, because
you don't know anything about it.
- You don't know what you're doing.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
I don't want you to be sorry!
I want you to stop it!
I'm stopping.
See, I'm stopping.
I'm stopping.
- Ray's house.
- Hi.
I, I didn't know
if you'd left yet.
No, I'm not leaving
till tomorrow.
Well, what time?
Um, bus leaves at 9:00.
Well...
I'd-I'd really like
to see you before you go.
Can-Can I give you
a lift?
Do you want to have
breakfast or anything?
I think Rudy would
really like to say good-bye.
Yeah. I don't know.
I mean...
Terry, you can't
just leave like this.
All right, all right.
Um, I'll come by tomorrow morning.
All right. Just...
We have to be out
of the house by 8:00,
so I don't want to tell Rudy you're
coming unless you think you can.
No, I mean, I'll be there.
- All right.
- All right.
You better get your sneakers on.
Sweetie, I'm sorry,
but we have to go.
Why can't I miss school one day?
- Hi.
- Hey, how's it going, man?
Sorry I'm late.
So Rudy, if I write you a letter,
will you write me back?
- Yeah.
- That's gonna be nice for you...
'cause I write a pretty
goddamn interesting letter.
Yeah, we'll see.
Well, all right.
Say good-bye.
Bye.
Do you need some cash
for the bus?
No, I got a few bucks.
Aren't you gonna be
late for work?
Oh, yeah. It's okay.
Terry, I don't even know
where you're going.
Well...
Yeah, I don't really have
a concrete plan yet.
I gotta go back to Worcester
and get my stuff.
- You gonna try and see that girl?
- Yeah.
I thought I'd try and show my face,
let her brother have a crack at me.
- What? I don't want...
- No.
- Anybody to have a crack at you.
- I'm just kidding.
I just... I just
thought I'd check up on her.
And then after that,
I don't know.
I've been thinking about
Alaska a lot, you know?
I've still got a lot
of friends out there.
I don't really know.
Anyway, I'll write you.
You will?
Sure, Sammy. Of course I will.
You know that.
What's gonna happen to you?
Nothing too bad.
I gotta tell you, and I know things
didn't work out too well this time,
- Terry...
- but it's really good to know...
wherever I am, and whatever
stupid shit I'm doing,
that you're back
at my home rooting for me.
It's all gonna be
all right, Sammy.
Comparatively.
And I'll be back
around this way again.
I feel like I'm never
gonna see you again.
Of course you will. You never
have to worry about that. Ever.
Just don't go anywhere until
you know where you're going.
- Please!
- I do know where I'm going.
I do. I'm going
back to Worcester.
And I'm gonna try
to see that girl.
And depending on
what happens there,
I'm gonna try and see if there's
some work for me out west.
And if there is, I'm gonna go there
this summer and make some money.
And if there isn't,
I'll figure something else out.
Maybe I'll stay in the east.
I don't know.
I really liked Alaska.
It was really beautiful,
and it just...
It made me feel good.
And before things got so messed up,
I was doing pretty well out there.
Seriously.
But I couldn't stay here, Sammy.
I don't want to live here.
But I'll keep in touch,
and I will be back,
because I want to see you
and I want to see Rudy.
We'll have Christmas together.
How's that, huh?
We'll have Christmas to...
Come on, Sammy.
You can trust me.
Come on, Sammy.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Hey, Sammy.
Remember when we were kids,
do you remember what we always
used to say to each other?
- Of course I do.
- Remember when we were kids?
