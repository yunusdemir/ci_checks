DAY FOR NIGHT
Let's all be quiet and play well.
Slowly and relaxed, In my tempo...
From the beglnnlng...
Strlke up together...
Here you can speed up...
Don't leave any gaps...
There, now all together...
Hold that last chord...
No sentlmentallty.
Just play the notes.
Thls fllm Is dedlcated
to Dorothy and Lillian Gish
Cut!
Everyone over here, please!
We'll do it again, right away!
What happened
coming out of the subway?
Last time it was better.
The bus was 2 seconds late.
The background activity
was late, too.
By the beauty parlor,
a lady was supposed to come out.
I never saw the cyclist go by,
either.
We'll do it again.
What went wrong was the beginning,
coming out of the subway.
Everyone came out together,
then there was no one.
Note start and end footages,
circle the good takes...
- Who do you give it to?
- Yourself!
You mean, I keep it?
Kill that arc!
Ladies and gentlemen,
here we are
at the Victorine Studios, in Nice,
where shooting starts today
on "Meet Pamela".
But today you won't meet Pamela!
The Hollywood star, Julie Baker
who plays Pamela
is eXpected soon,
but hasn't arrived yet.
But the other stars are here,
and I hope
to interview them shortly.
The slap may make it swell.
I don't mind!
Meet our male lead.
Mr. Bertrand!
You're the producer,
come and talk to us!
A producer should stay out of sight.
It's the story
of an older man
whose son brings home
an English bride.
It's the story of a young man
who marries an English girl.
3 months later he brings her
to his parents' Riviera home.
My character falls in love
with his daughter-in-law,
and she with him.
She falls in love
with her father-in-law.
The movie tells the story
of their illicit love affair.
What happens?
As in any tragedy, each character
must fulfill his destiny.
EXcuse me,
they need me on the set.
Pamela 1, take 4!
The bus!
Newsvendor, be livelier!
The lady with the dog, faster!
More activity around the subway!
Now the white car!
Alphonse, get ready!
Come out of the subway!
Faster!
Cafe terrace, more activity!
Lady with the dog, keep going!
Red car!
Faster, red car!
Red car, drive off!
Ready, Walter?
Move in on AleXander.
Move in closer!
Cut!
We'll do it from another angle.
Roll it!
Take 2.
Cut!
The last one was good.
Places, everyone! Once more!
Let's go!
This is the Atlantic Hotel.
In Nice.
Hold on, please.
I have a bathroom,
I wanted a shower.
Can I change rooms?
- Mine's a shower, I want a tub!
- We can trade!
Come on, let's go up! Great!
Julie's pictures!
OK, Joelle.
Julie's pictures...
Thanks, Odile.
Walter, have a look.
The pictures of Julie.
I remember her in that movie
with the car-chase.
Didn't she freak out once?
A minor depression. Over a year ago!
She walked out of a production!
Yes, but now she's married
to her doctor.
She must be fine now.
Is Bertrand worried?
I don't think so.
That's a good likeness.
She's lovely.
Any with her hair short?
Here's the wig.
- It's too dark.
- Could be lighter...
She'll wear a wig in "Pamela".
She has lovely eyes.
Yes, they're light green.
Looks just like her mother!
Good face, nice shape to it.
So pleasant...
Here's a good one!
She looks sad, but seXy.
EXcuse me, sir.
I'd like to show you the...
Sure, Bernard, show it to us.
The trick candle
for the costume party.
Plugging it in, turns it on.
Got a light?
If the actress keeps
it toward her face,
the light seems
to come from the candle!
She mustn't turn the candle
toward the camera,
or it'll give away the trick.
OK?
OK, Bernard. Sold.
And the wire goes?
In the sleeve and down the dress.
Look at this vase!
Not bad for a hotel vase.
I'd like to see it
in Severine's dining room
in the movie!
- It's cracked!
- Just swipe it!
Hi, Liliane. Hi, Alphonse.
These are for you!
Thanks for the trainee job.
Think you'll like
being a script-girl?
It's hard to say,
after one day!
It's a terrific job, you'll see.
I'll let you know in 2 months.
Right... So long, kids.
You didn't tell me!
He's stone deaf!
So what? Happened in the army.
Artillery fire!
Do me a favor.
Walk ahead,
so I can watch your ass.
Like this?
Yes, like that!
- I saw you!
- Saw me what?
- You're hot for the maid.
- I am?
Bastard!
She's your type.
A bouncy little duckling.
Don't tell me you're jealous!
Absolutely not!
Jealousy is dumb.
Or you have go all the way...
and commit murder!
You're the jealous type.
I can tell: your eyebrows meet.
My eyebrows meet?
No, they don't!
Those 2 beds look Ionely,
maybe they should meet.
We have to move the table.
You could've asked for a double bed!
It meant asking Lajoie,
the new production manager.
It's heavy!
There.
Now the second!
It's tougher than moving audiences!
What'll we do tonight?
Pierrot, the stills man,
gave me a list
of great little restaurants
up in the hills.
"Great little restaurants"!
We have to eat, don't we?
You must be kidding!
This town has 37 movie theaters!
We look in the papers, pick a movie,
go there and make sure
when it starts.
And if there's time,
we grab a sandwich.
Your stills man can take his list
of cute little "bistros"
and shove it!
You're impossible!
Listen, tonight,
I'm not going to a movie
or eating in this hotel
You decide.
OK, we'll do what you want...
But on one condition!
Which is?
That you marry me.
Odile, try this on.
It's for your scene.
Hold that. Not bad, huh?
Let's see the apron.
- Sold?
- I buy it.
Shootlng a movle Is llke
a stagecoach ride in the Old West.
At flrst you hope for a nlce trlp.
Soon you just hope
to reach your destination!
EXcuse me for bothering you, sir.
I'm the new production manager,
Lajoie.
About the car for Pamela's accident.
You have to choose one.
One of those two?
Can the white one be painted blue?
Sure for Fr650!
Just to paint it blue?
We'll use it as it is!
But it is very white...
What about that blue one?
It belongs to your assistant,
Jean-Fran?is!
Maybe he won't mind.
- I'll ask him.
- Yes, do that.
What Is a fllm-dlrector?
Someone who's asked questlons
about everything.
Sometlmes he knows the answers.
- You liked this location?
- It was fine. You were right
We were lucky, too. Great weather!
- Want to see the bungalow?
- Sure, let's go!
It's not built yet.
Just the sketches.
The interior will be furnished.
Bed, night tables,
chairs, table with...
Hold on!
The camera will never go inside.
We'll only shoot
through the window.
So all we'll ever see is the bed.
Sorry to bother you, but...
The Americans insist
on the original schedule.
You only have 7 weeks.
- Think you can do it?
- It won't be easy.
If you need 3 or 4 days
for pick-up shots,
we'll use a skeleton crew.
But the actors
must be released by Oct. 31st.
I'll go over the schedule
with Jean-Fran?is.
7 weeks.
Five days a week. 35 days!
I can't shoot thls scrlpt
in 35 days.
Can you look at this?
It's Severine's wig...
Isn't it a little too light?
Too light? I really don't know.
Tell Joelle to see Walter about it.
He's the cameraman, they can decide.
Props wants to see you.
Which gun do you like
for the final scene?
Alphonse has small hands.
But we won't take the smallest...
This one!
"Pamela" crew
report to screening room.
Here they are!
Rank and file all present
and accounted for? Good!
You'd be lost without
the rank and file!
What rushes are we seeing?
Severine and Alphonse...
- And the crowd scene?
- It didn't come in.
That's strange.
The crowd scene's missing.
Call and ask the lab in Paris.
It's Scene 1.
Go ahead...
Wait! Where's Severine?
She never comes to rushes.
- Where's AleXander?
- At the airport, as usual.
He goes every day!
He must be eXpecting someone.
I bet he has personal problems.
Mother, I have to talk to you.
It's about them, do you mlnd?
- Yesl
- I have to!
I've found out they're In Parls.
They're not even hldlng.
Why torture yourself?
Be llke me. Don't thlnk about them.
That's all I thlnk about.
Let's go away.
Just the two of us, far away.
We'll do whatever you want.
I've made up my mlnd
to go to Paris.
to klll them bothl
Use the "Not even hiding"
from Take 3.
We've got a big problem.
A power failure at the lab.
It ruined the crowd scene,
it has to be re-shot.
- When can you do it?
- Day after tomorrow...
Not before Monday!
We have to round up 150 eXtras!
- The insurance?
- I presume we're covered.
The way to make money today
is in real estate, not movies!
I stay in it, because I love it...
If we have to re-shoot the scene,
we will.
How are you, AleXander?
- That's nice. Is it for me?
- No, it's not.
Lajoie, our production manager.
- What's that?
- A bouquet for Madame Severine.
Wrapped in newspaper?
Go wrap it properly!
Tell me...
Does Severine know
I play her husband?
Of course. She was delighted.
That's good.
Go say hello to her.
Where's her dressing-room?
I'm so happy to see you!
Gorgeous as ever!
What about you?
How do you keep so young?
- I'm delighted to work with you.
- So am I!
Remember when we first met
in Hollywood?
No dates! Never mention numbers!
Or I'll tell everyone
you had a facelift!
Not yet. It's coming!
You know what? For you...
I might take up cooking again!
Remember how you loved
my risotto Milanese?
Well, I don't any more!
Just kidding!
I'll eat your risotto any time!
- Are we working together today?
- No, it's you and Alphonse.
I'm going to the airport.
See you.
Isn't he adorable?
When did I work with him... ?
20 years ago, in Hollywood!
We were there at the same time.
You know, he was a real ladies man.
In Hollywood, they called him...
- I loved him, too.
- Is he married?
I don't know if he is now.
He was married and divorced twice.
Maybe he lives with someone.
No one knows. He's very secretive.
He has a moustache in the movie.
I like it.
Moustache or not,
he's still playing lovers!
And look at me...
I'm only cast as the neglected wife!
Desperate... tragic... a real pain...
- You're lovely!
- No way...
Cue me for my scene today.
I can't remember a line!
For some reason, lately...
my memory has gone to hell.
EXcellent dressing-room.
Nice and spacious.
Only the flowers are missing.
They've been ordered.
You know,
I admire Julie Baker as much as you.
You wanted her, we got her!
But if she has a breakdown,
we've had it!
What do you mean?
After the medical eXam,
the doctor refused to insure her.
Said she's still too nervous,
and we should postpone
the shoot for a month!
What did the Americans say?
They're more fleXible
than the French.
They're gambling with us.
But if we lose,
no one'll take the blame.
We'll all be in hot water!
You have to trust
your luck sometimes...
You're right.
Still, it's a gamble!
- Seen Severine since the rushes?
- I went to say hello.
You know she had
an affair with AleXander?
- I heard...
- Very stormy.
Lots of publicity!
It ended badly.
For 4 years, no producer
could get them to work together.
They hated each other!
But time heals all wounds.
- Hello, Alphonse!
- Got a minute?
- Remember my check!
- It's all I think of.
Me, too!
This'll only take a minute.
Great dressing-room!
Nicer than mine!
It's Julie's...
I'm getting married to Liliane.
Fine. I'm glad to hear it.
Here in Nice.
Before we finish shooting.
I wondered...
Would you mind being my best man?
Not at all! I'd be delighted.
You think this looks all right?
- It's not bad...
- Nice blue.
Hit the fireplace
with a Senior spot!
A little more.
That's good, hold it!
Now a barndoor on the fire,
or we won't see it.
I can't take my eyes off the fire.
People used to stare at fires,
now they watch TV.
We need to see
moving images,
especially after dinner.
I never thought of that.
Alphonse told me.
I'm very happy for you.
Congratulations.
Congratulations?
Gilbert, light the 103.
Put out the fire!
It's smoking up the set.
I'd like you to meet
two German girls.
They're sisters: Greta and Diana.
She was in a big
German political film.
Do you do any?
She was in an erotic film.
Why don't you do one?
I have a good script
about pollution.
EXcuse me. We've got problem.
- What problem?
- I'm rescuing you!
Meet Mr. Giacometti.
Got a minute?
After this shot.
- Who's that guy?
- The cop who OK'd us to shoot
in the streets. So Bertrand
invited him to watch us work.
That's nice! Do I watch him work?
When he interrogates people?
Severine, we're ready.
You start here.
Quiet! A full rehearsal.
Let's go Severine.
"I don't understand you, AleXander!
"You're..."
"Peculiar."
It's all right!
Take it from the top, right away.
"I don't understand you, AleXander.
"You've been peculiar, lately.
"Walking out on dinner last night!
"That was an insult to Julie."
Damn! I said Julie for Pamela!
Not to worry.
That's bad...
Don't worry... Once more.
I've got an idea!
I'll use numbers,
the way I do with Fellini!
Instead of: "I don't
understand you, AleXander..."
I'll say: 22, 83, 16, 72...
5, 3, 18, 9, 14, 7, 9...
17, 10, 10, 4,
18, 69...
Impossible, Severine!
In France,
we have to say the lines.
See? We're recording direct sound.
We'll find another solution.
You always give me the scene
at the last minute!
Then we'll use prompt-cards.
Joelle, come here, darling.
It's all your fault.
"I don't understand you...
"You've been peculiar lately."
- Cut lots, we'll need them!
- Who asked you?
Are they placed right?
The last one's back there.
- Shooting now!
- Wait! Sound's reloading.
Sound's ready!
Hurry, Bernard!
"I don't understand you, AleXander.
"You've been peculiar
"lately.
"Walking out on dinner last night!
"That was an insult to... Pamela.
"After all, she is Alphonse's wife!
"You seem...
"to hate her!
You never speak to her.
"What do you want?
We're talking. Go away!
"And I won't tolerate that! "
Cut!
I did it!
Wasn't it good?
- Yes, but that's not the door!
- I thought it was.
That's the closet. There's the door.
Let's do it again.
We'll do it again.
- I thought it was the same door.
- It's all right. Ready!
They do look alike.
"I don't understand you, AleXander.
"You've been peculiar lately.
"Walking out on dinner last night!
That was an insult to Pamela.
"After all, she is Alphonse's wife!
"You seem to hate her,
"you never speak to her!
"What do you want? We're talking!
"Go away!
"And I won't tolerate that! "
Darling, look...
I know the doors are alike, but...
Not that one. This one!
You're my only friend!
Come to my dressing-room?
Come see me. Be nice!
"I don't understand you, AleXander.
"You've been peculiar lately.
"Walking out on dinner last night!
That was an insult to Pamela.
"After all, she is Alphonse's wife! "
She'll never do it.
It's not my fault!
Cut! Once more.
It's not my fault if I'm confused!
I don't know if she's Odile,
actress. Or Odile, make-up girl!
In my day, acting was acting...
And make-up was make-up!
No wonder I'm confused!
Anyone who has no business
on the set,
please leave now! Thanks.
That doesn't mean you have to go.
I wanted to go to the movies,
anyway.
Make-up, give me my mirror.
It's her fault, she's been boozing.
Her son's dying of leukemia...
She's afraid:
a phone call could come any time.
She almost turned down the film.
It'll be all right, Severine.
We'll take a little break.
I'm sorry. Maybe the wig
is giving me a headache.
This has never happened before...
It's the first time...
Don't worry, Severine.
Wrap it up for today!
Get some rest.
Where's Odile? Not that Odile!
Tell the make-up girl
I want my scarf.
Why don't you make
political films?
Why don't you make erotlc fllms?
You have to flnlsh shootlng
in 7 weeks.
Mlss Severlne
needs Odile in make-up.
Who is that woman I keep seeing?
Lajoie's wife.
Follows him everywhere.
Shall I try to get rid of her?
No, I'm getting used to her.
I don't know why Ferrand cast me.
- He can't stand me!
- Who told you that?
I know he thinks
I'm a lousy actress.
Just between us, maybe he's right.
No, he didn't cast me!
Was it the producer?
Something's peculiar
about this film.
He never considered anyone else.
- Really?
- I know it.
You never understand anything
anyway!
Well, I don't understand this!
It destroys me!
I'm sorry,
I was hired to play a secretary!
No one mentioned a swimsuit!
If they had,
I'd have brought my own!
It's not in the script,
but the scene plays better.
It's a working vacation.
The secretary is a guest.
She's swimming,
then he dictates a letter.
Sorry, it's impossible.
I'm not being difficult.
I even learned to type!
I wasn't told I had to swim.
I won't go near the water!
What can we shoot
until she calms down?
Until Julie Baker gets here,
the pool scene is all we have!
Go talk to her,
try to convince her.
An actress who won't appear
in a bathing suit is ludicrous!
"Darling! A telegram!
"The children are coming!
"Our son got married
and we haven't met his bride!
"No, wait!
Here, this is for you.
"- They're coming?
- Day after tomorrow.
"It's about time!
"I'm delighted.
"I'll write Stanley at once.
"I have to dictate a letter.
It must go out today.
"Coming, sir.
"Don't worry,
Stanley will solve it.
"If we could just rent
the house across the way!
"Marvelous!
Then they'd be close to us.
"Sorry to bother you now.
"The letter's to Stanley.
"Dear Stanley...
"I'm pleased to announce
the arrival of Alphonse.
"and his young bride..."
Now I see why she wouldn't
wear a swimsuit.
Why? She's lovely!
Take another look...
Good God!
Stacey tricked us!
She's 3 months pregnant!
She kept it secret,
so let's tear up her contract.
I don't agree.
Frankly, I don't think it shows.
Come over here.
Look at our schedule.
She shoots one more day now,
and comes back in 6 weeks.
By then, it'll show!
We have to replace her.
It's not a problem!
We'll pick someone now...
and call her agent.
Look, there's lots of girls.
Stacey has an iron-clad contract.
Her agent knows it.
I'll lose!
You know why?
Because in life, might makes right!
Mr Ferrand, a package for you.
The books I ordered.
- Delerue, the composer.
- I'll take it.
Here's the playback
for the costume party scene.
That's lovely, Georges,
thank you!
Airport...
Julie's plane... press conference!
I can't be late.
Say! You like to improvise.
Why can't the secretary
be pregnant in the film?
Maybe she could...
No! They'd suspect AleXander.
It'll confuse the story-line.
We can't do it.
Come to think of it...
Stacey isn't married!
I wonder who the father is?
Your questions, gentlemen.
Can you tell us
about your new movie?
"Meet Pamela"
is the story of a British girl
who falls in love
with her husband's father.
I think it's based on a true story.
How does it end?
Since it's a tragedy,
it'll end unhappily.
But I'd rather not reveal
all the details.
Do you think these days
people care if a girl
sleeps with her husband's father?
When I like a script enough
to do it,
I think audiences will like it, too.
You do?
Yes, and I hope I'm right.
Forgive me for intruding
into your private life,
but American papers reported
that after being ill,
you married your doctor.
No, I didn't marry my doctor.
I married a man who's a doctor!
Why isn't the lucky man among us?
My husband came with me.
In fact he's here,
in this very room.
Where is he?
Sorry, he hates publicity.
On that little note of mystery,
we'll end this,
and let Miss Baker go to her hotel.
Let the reporters leave first.
This is my husband, Dr Nelson.
Could you move back, please?
You're in the shot, there.
Thank you very much.
She's always around!
- She's Lajoie's wife...
- She thinks she's a crew member?
No, she thinks women are after him!
She makes his life hell.
He's too weak to dump her.
We call them
"The Sorrow and the Pity"!
Lajoie, we're ready to shoot.
What's going on there?
I don't like that at all!
You have "le trac"?
What does that mean?
Liliane! Slate this one, please!
Our stills man's very busy!
Roll it!
The car!
"Hello, children!
"My parents...
"Meet Pamela! "
Pan over to the stairs!
"I know you'll be happy here.
"Too bad our house isn't larger.
"From the balcony
you can see the sea! "
"She's charming..."
"Do you like it? "
"My son never tells me anything!
"I don't even know how you met."
"I was on vacation in Yorkshire
with my 2 cousins,
"Dorothy and Elizabeth.
"He had a date with Dorothy.
"She got chicken-poX,
so I went on the date.
"I don't know Dorothy,
"but I'm glad
you didn't get chicken-poX! "
"Who got chicken-poX? "
"Guess! "
Cut!
How was it?
Not bad,
but we'll try something else.
We're doing it again?
Was I late?
We'll try it differently.
- Take a break, Severine.
- Odile!
I wanted you with me,
so I got you the job!
I wanted us to be together.
But learning to be a script-girl
is a waste of time.
I want to learn film-editing.
Film-editing?
You just had to say the word!
I'd have arranged it!
You're here to take stills, right?
Odile!
Get that bottle out of my sight!
How's your mother?
Fine! I told her
we were working together.
She sends her love.
Marvelous woman!
Everyone in Hollywood loved her.
Too bad she quit when she did.
But she's still very busy.
She hated the way we shoot movies,
in bits and pieces!
I remember escorting her
to the premiere
of her first big Hollywood movie.
A fantastic evening!
When the film ended
she sat there,
then turned to me and said:
"I did all that?
All I remember is the waiting."
It's so true!
I'm calm, not yelling.
But I say you're on the make!
- That's not true!
- Oh, no? I'm in agony!
I'm in agony all the time!
I can't wait to finish a scene,
so I can go look for you!
I'm a complete wreck!
I can't find Alphonse!
I know where he is.
While I'm shooting, I'm in agony!
Can I shoot a scene
when I'm like this?
I'm supposed to keep cool!
If I'm no good, you're to blame!
I'm sorry to make you die again.
I'm used to it.
In 80 movies, I've died 24 times.
Electrocuted twice, hanged twice,
I've been knifed,
committed suicide,
died in accidents,
but never a natural death.
Anyway,
I don't think death is natural.
Julie will be right out,
she's changing.
- Did things go well?
- I'm very pleased.
I've never used an actress
I hadn't met before.
But Julie's just right,
determined, yet fragile.
She's perfect for the role.
It'll go fine.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Stacey.
It'll take 5 minutes, Bernard.
You won't miss your plane.
Ready with the pool scene?
Good, let's run it.
I need you.
I have an urgent letter to dlctate.
Yes slr. Rlght away.
- It doesn't show at all.
- You're sure? Good!
- That's lovely.
- If you say so...
It's not too... ?
- So it's OK?
- You can leave, don't worry.
Have a nice trip.
Now run the rest...
Know what?
I want to touch you.
- What's that set?
- The love-nest.
- It's in the script!
- I never read scripts.
It's when AleXander
runs off with Pamela.
They stop at a shady motel...
Get it?
It's morning,
they want to make love.
She puts the tray outside
to keep the maid out.
I'll leave.
You're not in this scene.
Don't worry, I'll be around.
Let me ask you...
Are women magic?
No, they're not.
Neither are men.
If a woman says
she's known outstanding men,
it means she's slept around...
EXcuse me, sir.
I have to take 3 days off.
You're leaving the crew?
My mother just died.
- I see. Was it sudden?
- No, she was in great pain.
For her, it was a relief.
- I see. Well, go ahead.
- But someone will fill in for me.
Sure, I understand.
I think we can start now.
You're not in the way, doctor.
Sit down. This shot should be fun.
I came to say goodbye.
My plane leaves in an hour.
If I'm through, I'll drive you.
What are we waiting for now?
Bernard, as usual.
I'm ready!
One cat's milk,
another cat's poison!
All right, we can go.
Ready, AleXander? Julie?
Not too romantic, the kiss...
The cat!
The boom is scaring it!
We'll wild-track the sound.
At the fish market!
Cut! Once more!
Do it this time, or else!
I swear,
it hasn't been fed in 3 days!
Throw it in!
We'll shoot the scene
when you find
a cat that can act!
I told you to get 2 cats!
Miss Know-it-all!
But when we're through,
I still have
to remove my make-up.
Why did you let me down, puss?
You got me in trouble!
Now where's Joelle?
I found one!
It's the studio cat.
I can tell by looking at it,
that it won't perform!
Don't fight.
We'll try the studio cat.
Places, everybody!
The kiss...
The tray...
The door...
The cat!
Focus!
Focus on the cat!
EXcuse me...
Can I ask you something?
In your opinion, are women magic?
Some are, yes.
Others, no!
Don't worry.
Julie will be fine.
Yes, she's very happy on this film.
I'm sure she'll come through.
- Actors are so vulnerable!
- Of course they are.
Everyone is afraid of being judged.
But actors
are always being judged.
In your work, and in your life!
We wonder what people think of us,
if they love us.
It must be the same
for all performers.
As a child, when Mozart
was asked to play, he'd reply:
"Gladly,
but first say you love me."
And in your job,
you're always kissing.
As you say...
Yes, we do a lot of kissing.
The handshake was invented
to show you're unarmed, friendly.
We went one better:
we show our love.
"My darling, you're so wonderful..."
We need all that!
Meet Christian Fersen.
Our director, Mr Ferrand.
Were you waiting outside?
You should've come in.
Do you see what I see?
- Are women magic?
- Not women, their legs!
That's why they wear skirts.
Cut the crap! We going to a movie?
- When does it start?
- We gotta leave.
The kitchen scene must be shot
tomorrow night!
The union contract
calls for a 12-hour break.
Joelle, we must shoot
the kitchen tomorrow.
- Can you work with me tonight?
- OK.
So much for the movies!
What's this I hear?
Yes,
we do the kitchen scene tomorrow.
- Can I have my lines?
- After dinner, tonight.
- That's not much time!
- It's not written yet.
Read it once
and put it under your pillow.
In the morning,
you'll know it by heart!
You're an optimist!
Reporters always ask
the same questions.
"How does it feel to be famous?
"To be recognized
and asked for autographs? "
But no TV program I've seen
ever shows that a working movie-star
gets up at 6AM
and gets home at 9PM!
A 15-hour work-day!
Not quite 15 hours.
Say 13.
Or 14, if you go to the rushes.
Mlss Severlne Isn't In her room.
"The Godfather"
is showing all over Nice.
It's wiping out every other movie!
Speaking of godfathers,
how about AleXander?
He fooled everybody.
We all eXpected a Lolita,
and a handsome Romeo
got off the plane!
Maybe he could do
Pamela's car-accident stunt.
It's too dangerous!
We need a real stuntman!
Back to the kitchen scene!
That night, AleXander
finds Pamela in the kitchen.
Why the kitchen?
So as not to arouse any suspicions.
I'm not happy with my first draft.
He: "You know
what's happening to us? "
She: "I think I do."
That's bad!
Pamela must know,
or her character will seem weak.
The scene needs a new idea.
Call your co-writer!
I thought of it. He's in Japan.
He's adapting
Turgenev's "First Love".
Set in modern Japan! Great idea!
Better than "Pamela"!
I should've done it!
Want a story-line?
How about:
Kissinger's Successful Mission?
Heart Transplant...
Jeweler Knifes Wife.
Back to work!
You dictate, I'll type.
We promised it to Julie tonight.
OK, back to the kitchen...
No more guilt
or sense of shame.
They decide to run away
like thieves in the night.
Pamela could actually say that!
We must show
that she's completely lucid.
She loved the son,
now she loves the father.
- That must come across.
- Julie eXplained it very well.
Here's her interview,
in the morning paper.
"The girl realizes
the boy she married
"is only a pale reflection
of his father."
She understood the script! Why?
Because her mother was an actress.
She knows Hollywood,
where many kids try to live up
to famous parents.
Fairbanks, Barrymore and others.
AleXander:
"You know what's happening to us? "
Damn, the phone!
Mlss Domlnlque Is here,
should she come up?
Sorry, I'm working.
I'll call tomorrow.
I'll glve her the message.
He's sorry, he has to work tonight.
He'll call you tomorrow.
- Three guesses?
- Stacked!
- Riviera beauty.
- Local call-girl.
- The warrior's rest!
- Right!
Hey, the movie quiz!
In what movle
did Jeanne Moreau co-star
wlth Orson Welles,
in a Shakespeare film?
"Falstaff"!
Correct.
In what movle
was she Charles IX's sister
and Henry IV's wlfe?
"Queen Margot"!
Rlght.
You know your stuff.
Julie, here's tomorrow's scene.
"Yes, I'm in love with you."
"We both knew it
at the costume party."
"I can't stay here,
I'm leaving tomorrow."
Let's close the window.
Remember...
No sentimentality in this scene.
Play it straight, cold...
Almost violent!
The rehearsal was good.
Let's do a take.
Lights out! Rain!
Less rain!
"Can't you sleep? "
"I heard someone.
I knew it was you.
"You can't sleep either? "
"I was thinking of you."
"You know what's happening to us? "
"Yes, I'm in love with you."
"How long have you known? "
"We both knew at the costume party.
"I can't stay here,
I'm leaving tomorrow."
"I've thought of it, too.
"I want us to leave together.
"That would be like running away."
"Yes it would, I know.
"But I don't want to lose you.
"Then let's leave now,
like thieves in the night."
Cut! How was it, Walter?
Fine, perfect!
What do we do neXt?
We do it again.
Llke thleves In the nlght.
Llke thleves...
We've been looking for you
for an hour!
I was waiting in my dressing-room.
But you were told last night.
No, I wasn't!
I didn't get a call-sheet.
All right, let's do it now.
The shootlng Is half-flnlshed.
Before startlng,
I hope to make a fine movie.
The problems begln
and I aim lower!
I hope to make the movle... perlodl
Halfway through I say to myself:
"You could've worked harder,
given more.
"You can stlll make up for ltl"
And I start trylng harder
to bring the film to life.
"Meet Pamela"
is on the right track, now.
The actors are Into thelr roles,
the crew is solid,
problems resolved.
Cinema is King!
The drinks are on AleXander today!
Any champagne left?
No, we'll have
to move on to Pernod.
Champagne's gone.
You won't get drunk.
Make yourselves at home.
Help yourselves!
He's handsome enough
to be in movies.
He wants no part of it.
He's into tennis.
I want to ask you something.
I've decided to adopt Christian.
I've always wanted a son.
Maybe I'm silly,
but I want someone
to bear my name after I'm gone.
It's a wonderful idea!
But there are problems.
Legal ones, I mean.
I'm not married now,
and he hasn't got a French passport.
Know what you should do?
Talk to President Lebaille!
The electrician's grandfather.
Go fish!
The cameraman's mother...
Meet Mark Spencer.
He's the British stuntman.
- Just got here, speaks no French.
- Julie will help.
Tell him the car-crash
we're shooting tomorrow
will be in "nuit americaine".
What's that?
A night scene shot in daylight
with a special filter.
Dressed as she is now.
He didn't understand.
I speak English well,
but don't understand it!
Stay here with me this morning.
Are you crazy?
Why? What are they shooting today?
Pamela's death.
The stuntman's doing the car-crash.
See? It's not an important scene!
I'm late. They're waiting.
Follow me and watch for the arrows!
What's this watch?
Pierrot lent it to me.
Mine's being fiXed.
Give it back to him!
I'll buy you a watch,
if you need one.
- Making it tough on me?
- Go on...
But that's mine. Keep it for me!
Sure, I will.
Hurry, guys! Let's move it!
What are you doing today?
And you?
I'm going antique-hunting.
I'll go to a movie.
What's the matter?
A damned flat!
And you don't know
how to change a tire!
Help me!
I'll be late for the shooting.
When you're driving,
you don't need a man!
We'll be late.
Move! It must be up front.
- You've never used a jack?
- I'm not a mechanic!
Neither am I!
What if you run out of gas?
Then I put some in.
In the carburetor, probably!
There. We're filthy!
I'll change into my sweater.
Hold that.
Joelle, if you're in the mood...
For what?
We're all alone here...
OK, you're on!
What?
All bark and no bite!
But when it's time for action...
You're willing?
But we haven't got all day.
Move it!
So where's Joelle?
She's not here. Neither is Bernard!
A life-size inflatable doll, guys!
For the car!
Or for your bathtub!
You're lucky he doesn't understand!
He'd slug you!
This isn't slow-motion,
move your asses!
You've all got seX on the brain.
Dirty talk all day long!
Whatcha doing, making a movie?
You need stars, we're available!
Let the workers through.
We're all farmers, right?
- Right, we're all farmers!
- Funny, you don't look Jewish!
Heard from your wife and kids,
Pierrot?
- So you finally got here!
- My car broke down!
Lucky I left after her, or she'd...
Fill me in.
Hey, you changed your top.
Ready to shoot!
OK, second camera?
- The stuntman?
- He's done.
Then he can pack up and leave.
He promised me a ride,
but he took Liliane instead.
Pretty cool!
What's all that luggage?
I might as well tell you.
We're in love.
He's taking me to London.
The film's not finished!
They don't need me,
I'm a fifth wheel.
You can't just quit.
They only hired me
for Alphonse's sake.
How is he taking this?
He'll get the surprise tonight.
He'll be terribly upset!
He's always terribly upset.
He's a spoiled brat
who won't grow up.
He loves you
and wants to marry you.
He mentioned marriage, I didn't!
Just the word gives me the creeps.
Anyway, he needs a wife, a mistress,
a nanny, a nurse, a sister...
I can't play all those roles!
You're being cruel,
and don't even realize it.
I'm through with Alphonse!
He wants the whole world
to pay for his unhappy childhood!
Julie, come get in the photo!
What photo?
A souvenir for me. It's my last day!
Wait. Here comes Stacey.
Come on, Stacey.
We're proud of you!
Stand there.
Looks like it's due soon.
And it's not even twins!
Lucky girl!
All her shots
will be close-ups now!
Don't move!
Wait! We're missing Liliane!
Where is she?
I have to talk to you.
Liliane won't be coming...
She was right to leave.
I understand,
it had to end this way.
Don't move!
Now Alphonse has disappeared!
And where's Odile?
Liliane ran off with the stuntman.
Does Alphonse know?
I had to tell him.
With the stuntman!
I'd drop a guy for a film.
I'd never drop a film for a guy!
Can you manage?
I'll eXplain...
We built this to convey that
you live across from your in-laws.
I'll cue you,
as Alphonse isn't here.
He's in love,
so we're in a pickle!
Good title: "The Pickles of Love".
"Rise and shine, kids! "
"Come have breakfast with us! "
"Alphonse is in bed."
NeXt line, Julie!
"We're invited over."
"We'll be right there."
Cut! Once more!
"Come have breakfast with us! "
"Alphonse is asleep."
No, no..."in bed! "
"We're invited over."
I know you're in there!
Open up. Everyone's asking for you.
They are not!
Severine leaves for Italy tonight.
I don't want to see anyone!
This actor had always dreamed
of playing Hamlet.
At last
he staged it and played the role!
But he was so bad,
he was booed every night.
One night he was fed up,
he stopped in the middle
of "To be or not to be..."
Turning to the audience, he said:
The champagne, at last!
You still have to finish "Pamela"!
I'm so sad to be leaving.
Come join us, machos!
Move your table!
Why are you all alone over there?
Are you sad, in love, heartbroken?
Don't! He's a just hotel guest.
So what?
Come join us, Mr Hotel Guest!
We're a movie crew
having a farewell party.
I'll introduce you.
Can I talk to you?
I think we should get Alphonse.
He's locked in his room, sulking!
He's a drag.
That's unfair.
I've known him for ages.
Never fails!
Then I'll go.
I'll try again.
Come see the great photos!
She's so cute...
She's not! Out!
What a funny life we lead!
We meet, we work together...
We love each other, and then...
As soon as we grasp something...
It's gone! See?
Severine is eXtraordinary.
We made a film together in Italy.
She was so good,
the director kept saying:
"She's greater than Eleanora Duse! "
So I called her Superduse!
Seen Alphonse?
He's locked in and won't come out.
Well, Severine's gone, so...
I need money to go to a whorehouse.
Come on, Alphonse.
Go back to your room,
re-read the script,
learn your lines,
then try to sleep.
Tomorrow we work.
That's what matters.
Don't be a fool.
You're a very good actor.
No one's private life runs smoothly.
That only happens in the movies.
No traffic jams, no dead periods.
Movies go along like trains
in the night.
And people like you and me
are only happy in our work.
I'm counting on you.
"Which costume
shall I choose for Saturday? "
Swltch the call from for 227 to 41+5.
It's Alphonse.
I wanted to tell you
I'm leaving tonight.
You've always been my frlend.
Tell Ferrand for me.
I have to talk to you. Wait!
Goodbye and thanks.
Wait for me!
What is all this? You can't leave.
I am, I'm giving it all up.
You'll stay and finish the film.
Even if I stayed,
I'm too upset to work!
I'm a physical wreck.
Is it normal for someone
to stop loving you
and just walk out?
Then it was all phony,
sickening!
I know how much
you've been hurt.
But I think Liliane still loves you.
You're being selfish, too.
You know it's difficult
for an outsider
to live with an actor.
But to leave with just anyone!
Some Brit stuntman!
Careful! I'm a Brit, too.
And I know those stuntmen.
You know
what'll happen to their affair.
At first, he'll take her
everywhere with him.
Then he'll get bored
and she'll feel lost
all alone in London.
She'll be back in 2 weeks.
Think so?
Anyway, it's over now.
I'd rather suffer.
You see,
I've made a terrible discovery.
You can be desperately in love
with someone you despise.
Whose every gesture,
word and thought you detest!
What right have you to say that?
Say you made a mistake,
but never be ashamed
of having loved!
By despising Liliane
you're merely...
degrading yourself.
Maybe you're right.
Anyway, my love-affairs
have always ended badly.
I thought women were magic.
Of course they're not magic.
Or men are, too.
Everyone's magic, and no one is.
I'm sure Ferrand is wrong.
Life is more important than films.
I'm going now. Thank you.
Don't be a fool.
Stay and finish your work.
Is that clock working?
It's 6 A. M! Time to make coffee!
Have you seen Julie?
I'm looking for Lajoie!
Know what that idiot did?
MiXed up his dates
and sent the costumes back!
So you've been up for hours?
All night, getting the costumes
from the airport.
Or no shooting today!
Where could Julie be?
In her room?
Her bed hasn't been slept in.
Everyone's nuts on this movie!
- What time is it?
- 6 AM.
- Where you going?
- To work.
You can sleep 2 more hours,
I set the alarm.
Stay with me.
I can't.
I have a make-up call
for the costume party scene.
Wait!
Kiss me.
You won't forget?
We'll go away together
when the film's done.
Sleep.
Dr Nelson? It's Alphonse.
I have something to tell you.
I love your wife.
I slept with her. Set her free!
Julie, call for you.
I think it's your husband.
- You owe me for this bill!
- Not now!
Later it'll be too late!
You looked everywhere?
He's not in his room?
Alphonse has disappeared!
Could he have gone to Paris?
There are flights at 8:50 and 10:10.
Call the airport.
You call, I'll go.
If he's there, I'll bring him back.
- We've got trouble!
- I know, Alphonse is gone.
I mean Julie! Nerves, I guess.
She locked herself in,
won't see anyone.
You can hear her crying.
I hope it's not another breakdown!
Let's go see.
There's Odile.
She got a call from Dr Nelson,
I think.
She asked me to leave,
and locked the door.
It's me, open the door!
Open up, we're your friends!
As producer, I want to help you.
Quiet!
You don't think she'd...
- Will she talk to you?
- She won't open the door.
You can hear her crying.
She keeps us out,
and lets Stacey in!
Motherhood has its privileges.
We can't find Alphonse anywhere.
Julie didn't sleep in her room.
Alphonse disappears,
Dr Nelson calls.
The picture's pretty clear!
What is this movie business?
Where everyone sleeps with everyone!
Everyone lies!
Do you think it's normal?
Your movie world...
I think it stinks!
I despise it!
Lajoie, calm your wife down!
That woman's wrong.
Movie people may be
more obvious about it,
but love makes
the world go round!
She wants tub butter.
Country butter, in bulk.
Is she crazy? What's she doing?
Crying. She'll stop,
but find her some tub butter!
Find some tub butter.
No way! It's not in the script!
That's not nice, or friendly!
Aren't we one big family?
So were the people
in Greek tragedies!
Tub butter!
All right, I'll find it myself.
He's really quite lucky.
Some whims are more eXpensive!
There was an Austrian actress,
Hedy Lamarr,
became a big Hollywood star.
She really missed the rainy climate
of her native Tyrol.
So, in her garden in California,
she installed
a rain-making machine.
So a little thing like tub butter...
Come help me!
This is all I could find.
That's not it!
There's no tub butter
on the whole Riviera!
So we'll knead this
into one block...
wrap it in gauze,
and it'll look like it!
Think it'll work?
It has to.
What a business!
I found Alphonse. Where?
You'll never guess!
I'll bring him in.
There you are!
Here's the famous tub butter.
I won't deliver it!
No! Like the chef
in "Rules Of The Game",
"I cater to diets, but not fads! "
Here's what you asked for.
You didn't!
Forgive me.
I'm so ashamed!
I'll be all right in a minute.
I know it's not very professional.
I don't like being like this,
holding you up.
It's all right, we can wait awhile.
We'll change the schedule.
Don't change it because of me!
I'll be all right in a minute.
Can you lend me a handkerchief?
I must look awful.
Why did Alphonse do it?
He didn't understand anything!
He acted like the child he is.
I saw enough of your husband
to know he's a wonderful man.
Yes, he is.
But you don't know the whole story.
When I had my breakdown,
he did a very serious thing.
He left his wife and children.
He gave up a life
it took him 20 years to create.
He did that for me.
He devoted himself to me.
He tried to make me
into a responsible adult.
Now he must think
it was an awful waste.
No, when he knows what happened,
he'll understand.
He'll forget, it'll be over.
You think so?
Even if that's true,
I'll never forget...
Thanks to him,
I know I can change my life.
I've decided to live alone.
I'm sick of disguises.
I'm quitting movies.
I know that life is rotten.
Since we can't shoot,
we'll record some wild tracks.
- Ready, Ren?
- OK. Applause first.
Now some background talk.
Don't discuss movies!
Now more applause.
Julie's dressing-room
is upstairs-right.
I called him and he agreed to come!
I really screwed up.
What can I say to Julie
when I see her?
- Should I apologize?
- The less said, the better.
I've made up my mind.
I'm quitting movies.
That's a good idea, you do that!
Are you seeing Julie?
Give her this new dialogue
for the scene.
She's to learn it.
Can I fiX your make-up now?
I'm fine now.
We'll make ourselves beautiful!
This is your new dialogue
for the scene.
"Even if that's true,
I'll never forget...
"I've decided to live alone.
"I know that life is rotten."
He's got some nerve!
Are you all right, Julie?
Let's do it!
"I've decided to live alone.
"I know that life is rotten."
"No, it isn't."
Cut! Once more, for the hands.
The candle okay?
- Places.
- Places, and quiet please!
I'll caress her with this hand.
Places.
And let's do it.
"I've decided to live alone.
"I know that life is rotten."
"No, it isn't."
Cut. That was the best one!
AleXander is dead!
A car accident.
Returning from the airport,
where went to meet Christian.
A truck hit their car.
Christian is badly hurt,
but he'll recover.
AleXander died...
on the way to the hospital.
Alexander was burled
in a little cemetery above Nice.
Now the fllm's fate was In the hands
of the English insurers.
What I always feared had happened:
a productlon halted by death.
The era of studlo movles
died with AleXander.
Fllms wlll be shot In the streets,
without stars, or scripts.
There wlll be no more fllms
like "Meet Pamela".
"Hello, Pamela! "
"Come have breakfast with us! "
"Alphonse is still asleep! "
No..."in bed? "
"We're invited over."
"We'll be right there."
- Was that OK?
- Fine. Cut!
Wait, I'm coming over!
I was afraid
he might have an accident.
I offered him a driver.
He wasn't at home anywhere.
Always rushing off somewhere.
A man in a hurry.
No, he was at home everywhere.
He liked people,
he lived for the moment.
He couldn't leave places.
He was rushing back not to be late.
You could say,
he died out of generosity.
You may be right.
Now we have to finish the film.
What does
the insurance company say?
Mr Johanson talked at length
to London last night.
You can't re-shoot AleXander's
scenes with another actor.
The only solution
is to simplify the script
and finish shooting
in 5 days instead of 2 weeks.
Then the insurance
will cover everything.
5 days!
We'll have to simplify things.
We'll leave AleXander
out of the costume party scene.
Then the shot with the candles
makes no sense any more.
We'll cut the costume party scene.
The story works without it.
Then the only important scene left,
is when Alphonse kills his father.
We can shoot it in the street,
and hire a stand-in for AleXander.
It won't work, unless Alphonse
shoots him in the back.
Why not? In the back!
It's better, far more violent.
Why not have it all take place
in the snow?
All right, Walter.
Just like last time.
But we'll be closer
on Alphonse this time.
But we have to see the gun.
Here's the stand-in.
Could you walk away?
We have to see how you look.
Too much hair on the neck.
It has to work!
That's AleXander's stand-in.
Trim his hair more like AleXander's.
This is the gun you wanted
for Alphonse, right?
If that's the one I chose, sure.
Places, everybody. Hurry!
Hurry, please!
To the places I showed you!
I don't want the snow
too white, or too clean.
Don't worry, I'll fiX it
like in "The Snow Was Black".
I've been offered a movie in Tokyo.
I want to accept.
Turgenev's "First Love",
a good story.
For a movie?
With a Japanese girl
and you as the Frenchman, sure!
I'll do it because it's Tokyo.
13,000 miles from my problems!
Should I hold the gun like this?
Or like that?
Like that.
So it's seen against the snow.
Dr Nelson and Julie
want to say goodbye.
- Off to London?
- Australia! A medical conference.
Be ready to shoot when I get back!
See you in Paris for the post-synch!
Let's go before it gets dark!
Good luck.
You, too.
More discreetly!
Walk faster!
The gun!
Run away!
Run to the far end!
Cut!
Shooting's over! Thanks, everyone!
Going back to Paris?
No, I'm staying around here
for a rest.
Have a nice rest.
My car was wrecked in the stunt.
I've got another one in Paris,
but I need a ride.
With me? Impossible!
It's full of my gear.
Anyway, I like to be independent!
Yann, wait for me!
See you in the bread line!
Unemployment, here we come!
I'm taking Odile to meet my folks.
We're getting married.
Well, very cagey of you!
I bet no one suspected.
She's eXperienced and I'm not.
A happy medium!
All the best, congratulations.
And thanks. Great camera work!
Glad you like it.
'Bye, kids! Have a nice trip.
Drive carefully!
Could you talk to us
about AleXander?
No, it's too personal.
Ask Bertrand, the producer.
He refused.
- Alphonse?
- He won't talk about death!
Sorry...
I'll talk to you!
Got him framed?
- Who's he?
- Props, I think.
Wasn't it a hard film to make?
Lots of trouble during the shooting?
Not at all! It went fine!
And we hope audiences
enjoy seeing it
as much as we enjoyed making it!
