THAT'S WHY I'M--
 THAT'S WHO THE HELL I AM.
OH, MY.
HOW DARE YOU COME TO THE
PRESIDENT AND ASK FOR A JOB ?
WHY DO YOU THINK I HAVE
A PERSONNEL MAN ?
WHY DO YOU THINK I HAVE A WHOLE

[ Sighs ]
WHERE DO YOU THINK

TO SEE THE PERSONNEL MANAGER.
I'M THE MANAGER.
WE'RE NOT HIRING ANYONE.
WELL, I WAS JUST SPEAKING
TO MR. BIGGLEY.
BIGGLEY ?  J.B. BIGGLEY ?
YES, SIR.
HE TOLD ME TO SEE YOU.
YOU WERE SPEAKING
TO J.B. BIGGLEY HIMSELF ?
I JUST BUMPED INTO HIM.
HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS ?
I DON'T THINK A MAN SHOULD TRADE
ON FRIENDSHIP TO GET A JOB.

WHAT'S THE BIG URGENT URGENCY ?
OH, HE HAS THAT WOEBEGONE LOOK.
A PUPPY DOG.
WELL, YOU COULD JUST TELL
HE'LL NEVER GET ANYWHERE.
I FIGURED YOU COULD INTRODUCE--
WHERE'D HE GO ?
HOW SHOULD I KNOW ?
ROSEMARY,
WHAT'S GOT INTO YOU ?
WHERE IS THIS CREEP DIFFERENT
FROM ALL OTHER CREEPS ?
HE'S NOT A CREEP !
SMITTY, HE HAS
A SORT OF UNDAUNTED
SORT OF NOBLE COURAGE.
YET DEEP DOWN, YOU SENSE
HE'S A HELPLESS
LITTLE MUFFIN.
[ Laughing ]
...THE MAN
IN THE MANHOLE COVER.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
IT'S ALL SETTLED, THEN.
NICE TO HAVE YOU ABOARD, FINCH.
WELL, I'M HAPPY TO SHIP OUT
WITH YOU, SIR.  REALLY.
YOU DON'T HAVE A--
OH, YES, YES.
LET ME DO THAT FOR YOU.

HI.  I'M
LUCILLE KRUMHOLTZ.
MR. FINCH WILL BE
STARTING OUT IN OUR MAIL ROOM.
GLAD YOU DON'T MIND THAT, FINCH.
OH, SIR, IN A BIG POND
LIKE THIS, EVERYONE MUST
BEGIN AS A LITTLE FISH.
EVEN A BARRACUDA.
WHAT'D YOU SAY ?
SAY, BUD.  HAVE YOU GUYS
IN THE MAIL ROOM SENT OUT
THOSE NEW WICKET CATALOGS YET ?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M GOING TO THE BARBER SHOP
TO GET A SCALP MASSAGE.
AT THIS TIME
OF THE MORNING ?  WHY ?
BECAUSE I'M THE BOSS'S NEPHEW.
[ Mutters ]
[ Laughing, Chatting ]
EXCUSE ME.
OH, BUD.
THIS IS BUD FRUMP,
MR. BIGGLEY'S NEPHEW.
SAY HELLO TO OUR NEW MR. FINCH.

GOOD.  YOU JUST
KEEP THAT IN MIND.
IF YOU JUST REMEMBER
WHO I AM AND WHO YOU ARE,
WE'LL GET ALONG FINE.  IF NOT--
YOU'LL GO CRYING
TO YOUR UNCLE.
I BEG YOUR PARDON !
I DO NOT GO CRYING
TO MY UNCLE !
IT JUST HAPPENS THAT MY MOTHER
IS MRS. BIGGLEY'S SISTER.
IF SOMETHING IS WRONG,
I PHONE MY MOTHER.
SHE PHONES MRS. BIGGLEY,
AND MRS. BIGGLEY
PHONES MR. BIGGLEY.
THAT'S THE DEMOCRATIC WAY.
[ Chuckles ]
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT BUD FRUMP.
EVERY COMPANY HAS A COUPLE
OF RELATIVES FLOATING AROUND.
SMITTY, YOU WERE GOING
TO GET MR. FINCH'S
VITAL STATISTICS.
OH, YES.  THE FIRST
QUESTION IS--
MARRIED ?
MARRIED ?  NO.
I'M NOT, AND I DON'T EVEN
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
GOOD !
GOOD.  I MEAN, IT'S GOOD YOU
ANSWERED WITH THE RIGHT ANSWER.
FOR THE QUESTIONNAIRE,
THAT IS.  IT'S NOT VERY WISE
TO HAVE A GIRL.
NO, IT ISN'T.
I'M GLAD YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.
SOME WOMEN WOULDN'T.
I FEEL THAT
WHEN A MAN WANTS TO RISE
IN THE WORLD OF BUSINESS,
A GIRL, OR LET'S SAY
AN EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT,
CAN ONLY LEAD TO GETTING
INVOLVED... EMOTIONALLY.
WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT ?
THAT'S VERY INTELLIGENT,
MR. FINCH.
ARE YOU QUITE FINISHED
WITH MR. FINCH ?
FOR THE MOMENT.
IRVING !  TAKE MR. FINCH
TO THE MAIL ROOM AND INTRODUCE
HIM TO MR. TWIMBLE.
YOU CAN FILL IN
THE PERSONNEL FORMS LATER.

ALL YOU'VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT !
LEMON DROPS ?
WHERE DID THESE LEMON DROPS
COME FROM ?
OH, THEY'RE MINE,
MR. TWIMBLE.
I JUST THOUGHT
I'D SHARE THEM
WITH OUR MAIL ROOM FAMILY.
LEMON IS MY FAVORITE DROP.
OH, I'LL BE DARNED.

I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO,
AND IF ANYBODY'S GONNA GET HIS
JOB--
MR. BRATT.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
WELL, BOYS, THEY'RE FINALLY
GONNA PROMOTE OLD TWIMBLE
TO THE SHIPPING DEPARTMENT.
CONGRATULATIONS.
UH, YEAH, CONGRATULATIONS.
WHO'S GONNA BE NEW HEAD
OF THE MAIL ROOM ?
MR. BRATT IS GONNA
LEAVE THE CHOICE TO ME.
"TWIMBLE," HE SAID, "THE
MAIL ROOM IS THE NERVE CENTER
OF THIS MIGHTY ORGANIZATION.
"YOU'VE BEEN AN OUTSTANDING
 MAIL ROOM HEAD.  WE WANT YOU
 TO CHOOSE YOUR SUCCESSOR.
"WE WANT YOU TO CHOOSE HIM
 ON MERIT.
ON MERIT ALONE."
THAT'S NOT FAIR !
I'M GOING OUT
TO HAVE A SMOKE.
SMOKE ?
HE'S GONNA CALL HIS MOTHER.
IT WON'T DO HIM ANY GOOD.
BRATT SAID I WAS GONNA
SELECT THE NEW HEAD.
[ Scoffs ]
MR. TWIMBLE ?
YEAH ?
YOU'VE BEEN WITH THIS COMPANY
A LONG TIME NOW, HAVEN'T YOU ?
A LONG TIME.
LAST MONTH I BECAME
A QUARTER-OF-A-CENTURY MAN.
OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
A QUARTER OF A CENTURY ?
QUARTER OF A CENTURY.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
IN THE MAIL ROOM ?
TWENTY-FIVE YEARS.
IT'S NOT EASY TO GET THIS MEDAL.
TAKES A COMBINATION OF SKILL,
DIPLOMACY...
AND BOLD CAUTION.
?? WHEN I JOINED THIS FIRM ??
?? AS A BRASH YOUNG MAN ??
?? WELL, I SAID TO MYSELF

?? BUT WHAT IS YOUR
  POINT OF VIEW ??
?? I HAVE NO POINT OF VIEW ??
?? SUPPOSING THE COMPANY
  THINKS ??
?? I THINK SO TOO ??
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU
SAY IF--
I WOULDN'T SAY.  I WOULDN'T SAY.
?? YOUR FACE

?? IT SMILES AT EXECUTIVES
  THEN GOES BACK IN PLACE ??
?? THE COMPANY FURNITURE ??
?? OH, IT SUITS ME FINE ??
?? THE COMPANY LETTERHEAD ??
?? A VALENTINE ??
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'RE AGAINST ?
UNEMPLOYMENT.
?? WHEN THEY WANT
  BRILLIANT THINKING ??
?? FROM EMPLOYEES ??
?? THAT IS NO CONCERN OF MINE ??
?? SUPPOSE A MAN OF GENIUS
  MAKES SUGGESTIONS ??
?? WATCH THAT GENIUS
  GET SUGGESTED TO RESIGN ??
?? SO YOU PLAY IT
  THE COMPANY WAY ??
?? OH, COMPANY POLICY
  IS BY ME OKAY ??
?? YOU'LL NEVER RISE UP
  TO THE TOP ??
?? BUT THERE'S ONE THING CLEAR
  WHOEVER THE COMPANY FIRES ??
??
?? I WILL STILL BE HERE
OH, YOU CERTAINLY
FOUND A HOME.
IT'S COZY.
?? YOUR BRAIN
  IS A COMPANY BRAIN ??

  WHAT PUNCH ??
?? THE COMPANY RESTAURANT ??
?? EVERY DAY, SAME LUNCH ??

IT'S DELICIOUS.
OH, I MUST TRY IT.
EARLY IN THE WEEK.

THANK YOU.
AND IF IT'S NOT OUT OF PLACE
FOR ME TO SAY SO, MISS JONES,
I THINK YOU'RE VERY ATTRACTIVE,
NO MATTER WHAT BUD FRUMP SAYS.
WHAT DID YOU SAY
YOUR NAME WAS ?
FINCH.  F-I-N-C-H.
FINCH.  PIERREPONT FINCH.
WHY HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU
AROUND HERE BEFORE ?
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO DELIVER
THE EXECUTIVE MAIL.
THAT'S HIS JOB.
BUD FRUMP.  F-R-U-M-P.
HMM.  WELL, THANK YOU
FOR THE FLOWER, FINCH.
YOU'RE A VERY INTERESTING
YOUNG MAN.
YOU'RE WELCOME, MISS JONES.
JONESIE, I'D LIKE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THE BOSS AT AROUND 3:00.
I'LL LET YOU KNOW, MILT.
AH, FLOWERS.
GOT A NEW BOYFRIEND,
JONESIE ?
THIS WAS GIVEN TO ME
BY A VERY NICE YOUNG MAN.
YOU SHOULD KNOW HIM.  FINCH ?
YES, MA'AM ?
FINCH, THIS IS
MR. GATCH.
HOW ARE YOU, SON ?
MR. GATCH IS GOOD TO KNOW.  HIS
DEPARTMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT MR. GATCH.
HE'S MANAGER OF EXECUTIVE
PERSONNEL PLACEMENT.
WONDERFUL MEMO THAT YOU PUT OUT
THIS MORNING, SIR,
ABOUT THAT, UH, EXECUTIVE
PERSONNEL PLACEMENT SERVICE.
YOU READ THE MEMOS ?
AND YOUR NAME IS--
FINCH.  F-I-N--

SAY, JONESIE,
THIS IS A SMART ONE.
WE'LL HAVE TO
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.
AH, THAT'S A VERY FINE MAN,
MR. GATCH.
I HEAR HE HAS A FINE OPENING
IN HIS DEPARTMENT.
BUT HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE
TO MAKE UP HIS MIND.
WELL, AGAIN, THANKS
FOR THE FLOWER, YOUNG MAN.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
I CAUGHT YOU !
YOU GIVE ME THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
A FELLA CAN'T GO FOR A SMOKE
WITHOUT GETTING STABBED !
IT'S THE EXECUTIVE MAIL !
THE EXECUTIVE MAIL
IS MY JOB.
MR. TWIMBLE TOLD ME--
IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ABOUT
CLIMBING THE LADDER HERE,
THE VIEW IS GONNA GET
AWFULLY MONOTONOUS.
EVERY TIME YOU LOOK UP,
YOU'RE GONNA SEE
THE SEAT OF MY PANTS.
HIYA, JONESIE.
"MISS JONES" TO YOU,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
[ Phone Rings ]
MR. BIGGLEY'S OFFICE.
ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.
[ Buzz ]
YES, MISS JONES.
WHAT IS IT ?
YOUR WIFE IS ON LINE TWO.
TELL HER I'M BUSY.
TELL HER I'M IN A MEETING.
TELL HER I'M OUT.
DAMN IT.  PUT HER ON.
HELLO, GERTRUDE.
GLAD YOU CALLED.
DEAR, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT BUD.
I'M BUSY.
NOW, JASPER,
THIS IS IMPORTANT.
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME ?
HE'S HEARD THERE'S
GOING TO BE AN OPENING
IN THE MAIL ROOM MANAGEMENT.
I CAN'T HELP BUD THERE.
THE HEAD OF THE MAIL ROOM SHOULD
CHOOSE HIS OWN SUCCESSOR.
YOU'RE THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY.
I CAN'T SWITCH SIGNALS
IN THE MIDDLE OF A PLAY.
IT WOULD UPSET THE TEAM.
IF YOU WANTED TO,
YOU COULD !
IF I INTERFERED,
IT'D BE NEPOTISM.
IT WOULD BE WHAT ?
NEPOTISM !
WHAT'S NEPOTISM ?
THAT'S WHEN YOUR NEPHEW
IS A DAMN POOP.
NOW, LOOK HERE, JASPER--
I'LL DO SOMETHING.
 I'LL DO SOMETHING.
DAMN, DAMN COAL-BURNING,
DITHERING, DING, DING.
MISS JONES.
YES, MR. BIGGLEY ?
YOU KNOW THAT TALKING
TO MY WIFE UPSETS ME.
YOU SAID TO PUT HER ON.
NEVER MIND THAT.  I NEED
SOMETHING TO CALM MY NERVES !
WHERE IS MY--
YOU KNOW.
[ Softly ]
I PUT IT IN THE BACK
OF YOUR RIGHT-HAND DRAWER.
AH, YES, YES, YES.
HERE IT IS.
[ Author's Voice ]
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU HAVE FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS
AND HAVE MADE IT TO THE FIRST
RUNG OF THE LADDER.
YOU ARE WORKING
IN THE MAIL ROOM.
ONE WORD OF CAUTION
ABOUT THE MAIL ROOM.
IT IS A PLACE
OUT OF WHICH YOU MUST GET.
WELL, TWIMBLE,
WE'VE GOT GREAT NEWS FOR YOU !
YES, MR. BRATT ?
BOYS, BOYS, GATHER ROUND.
GATHER ROUND.
BOYS, AS OF TODAY YOUR BOSS
IS BEING PROMOTED TO HEAD
OF THE SHIPPING DEPARTMENT.
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
BACK TO WORK.  BACK TO WORK.
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT
YOUR SUCCESSOR.
OH, SAY, MR. BRATT !
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM
MY UNCLE TODAY ?
NO, BUD.
ALL RIGHT, TWIMBLE, YOUR SHOES
ARE GOING TO BE HARD TO FILL,
BUT WHO HAVE YOU PICKED ?
I'VE GIVEN IT A GOOD DEAL
OF THOUGHT,
AND I THINK THIS IS OUR MAN.
CONGRATULATIONS, FINCH !
I'M GOING OUT FOR A SMOKE.
THANKS.
NO, I CAN'T ACCEPT.
ARE YOU TURNING THIS JOB DOWN ?
YES, SIR.  I THINK THERE'S
A MAN WHO'S BETTER QUALIFIED,
AND A MAN WHO'S BEEN HERE
LONGER THAN I HAVE.
GENTLEMEN, I RECOMMEND
BUD FRUMP FOR THIS JOB.
YOU'RE KIDDING.
NO.
BUD FRUMP.  YECH.
AS LONG AS HE FEELS SO STRONGLY,
I'LL GO WITH THE RECOMMENDATION.
I GOTTA CALL MY MOTHER !
SHE'LL BE SO HAPPY !
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YES, UH, WELL, MR. TWIMBLE,
LET ME EXPLAIN.
KNOWING YOU HAS TAUGHT ME
A LOT ABOUT-- WELL,
THE CORPORATE SETUP.
HELLO, MAIL ROOM.
OH, YES, J.B.
THIS IS BRATT.
THAT'S THE BIG BOSS.
THAT SISTER-IN-LAW OF MINE HAS
BEEN CALLING MY WIFE AND GIVING
ME A BAD TIME ABOUT BUD FRUMP.
I UNDERSTAND YOUR PROBLEM, J.B.
ACTUALLY WE HAD PICKED SOMEONE
ELSE, BUT IT'S TURNED OUT FINE.
THE YOUNG FELLOW
TURNED THE JOB OVER TO BUD.
HE THINKS BUD'S
BETTER QUALIFIED.
NO, HE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE OUT OF HIS MIND.
HE WAS EXPLAINING
WHEN YOU CALLED.
GO AHEAD, FINCH.
MR. TWIMBLE, THE GREAT THING
THAT YOU'VE TAUGHT ME...
IS THAT NO INDIVIDUAL IS AS
IMPORTANT AS THE WHOLE COMPANY.
NO INDIVIDUAL
IS AS IMPORTANT
AS THE COMPANY.
THE WHOLE TEAM IS GREATER
THAN ANY SINGLE PLAYER.
THE WHOLE TEAM IS GREATER.
THE WHOLE CREW IS GREATER
THAN ANY ONE OARSMAN.
THE WHOLE CREW IS GREATER !
THE WHOLE SALAD IS LARGER
THAN ONE PIECE OF LETTUCE.
THE WHOLE SALAD--
OH, YOU CAN HEAR HIM.
THE WHOLE OMELET...
IS LARGER THAN ONE EGG
THAT YOU MIGHT--
SEE--
ISN'T THAT GREAT, J.B. ?
SORT OF CHOKES YOU UP.
HIS NAME'S FINCH.
F-I-N-C-H.
F-I-N-C-H.
WHAT IT MEANS IS--
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY
THAT SAME THING, J.B. !
WE SHOULD KEEP AN EYE
ON THAT YOUNG LAD.
NICE TO CHAT
WITH YOU, J.B.
SEE YOU LATER.
OH, FINCH, YOU
GOT ME OFF THE SPOT
WITH MR. BIGGLEY.
I'M GLAD
TO BE OF HELP, SIR.
OH, THAT FEELS GOOD.
WELL, TWIMBLE, GOOD LUCK
IN THE NEW JOB, SIR.

HE IS ?
FINCH, I'M GOING
TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT YOU.

AND THOUGHTFULNESS MAY HAVE
PROVEN A GOOD THING FOR YOU.

OH, THERE YOU--
GOOD EVENING, MR. BIGGLEY.
GOOD EVENING,
MISS LaRUE.
UNCLE JASPER, I WANT--
I TOLD YOU NEVER TO CALL ME
THAT AROUND HERE.
HAVEN'T YOU SOMETHING
TO DO ?
I WAS JUST GONNA GET MY HAT
AND GO HOME.
GOOD.  DO IT !
HOW DO YOU LIKE
YOUR NEW JOB, MISS LaRUE ?
IT'S A BIG FAT NOTHING.
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT HERE !
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA HELP ME
BE A BIG BUSINESS WOMAN...
LIKE HELENA RUBENSTEIN
OR FANNIE FARMER.
SO WHAT HAPPENS ?
I'M STUCK IN THE LOUSY
STENOGRAPHIC POOL...
WITH NO ONE TO FISH ME
THE HELL OUT.
BUT ANGEL, THESE
THINGS TAKE TIME.
YOU HAVE TO LEARN--
YES, MISS LaRUE,
IN A LARGE OPERATION
LIKE WORLD WIDE WICKETS,
THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACETS
WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT
TO THE SCHEME OF THINGS.
I GAVE UP A WONDERFUL JOB.
HEAD CIGARETTE GIRL AT THE COPA.
I THOUGHT YOU HATED
ALL THOSE MEN STARING
AT YOU, MAKING ADVANCES.
WELL, IT'S NO DIFFERENT HERE
IN BIG BUSINESS.
AT LEAST AT THE COPA, WHEN I
GOT PINCHED, I GOT TIPPED.
AROUND HERE, A GIRL CAN'T EVEN
BEND DOWN TO PICK UP A PENCIL
WITH CONFIDENCE.
YOU MEAN SOMEBODY'S BEEN
BOTHERING YOU ?  WHO ?
JUST LET ME KNOW WHO HE IS--
YES !  MISS LaRUE, IN A LARGE
OPERATION LIKE WORLD WIDE FACETS
THERE ARE MULTIPLE WICKETS--
WHO PINCHED YOU ?
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
LOOK.
YOU DID NOT KEEP YOUR PART
OF MY BARGAIN.
BUT DARLING, I MEANT EVERY WORD.
TELL YOU WHAT.  I'LL MEET YOU
AT YOUR PLACE IN TEN MINUTES.
WE'LL TALK EVERYTHING OVER.
NO.
BUT ANGEL--
YES, MISS LaRUE,
IN A LARGE OPERATION--
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME ?
I'M WAITING
FOR THE ELEVATOR.
WHY DON'T YOU WALK DOWN ?
IT'S 30 FLOORS.
WHY DON'T YOU JUMP ?
[ Giggles ]
OH, J.B.

MISS LaRUE.
YES, SHE IS.
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PUT HER AT EASE.
SHE'S A VERY SHY PERSON.
YES.  WELL, YOU JUST
GO AHEAD, J.B.
I'M MEETING MOTHER
FOR DINNER.
MOTHER JUST LOVES
HAVING DINNER WITH ME.
I TELL HER EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENS ALL DAY
AT THE OFFICE.
?? NOW HE'S THINKING ??
?? THE KID COULD REALLY
  PUT ME THROUGH HELL ??
?? AND SHE'S THINKING ??
?? THE KID COULD EVEN
  NAME THE HOTEL ??
?
?? NOW HE'S THINKING ??
?? I WONDER
  IF HE'D DARE ?
?? AND SHE'S THINKING ??
?? THERE'S BLACKMAIL
  IN THE AIR ??
?? AND HE SAYS ??
IT'S A HOLDUP.
?? AND SHE SAYS ??
DOWN !
WAIT A MINUTE.
OKAY, YOU'RE PROMOTED.
?
?? WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG
  BEEN A LONG, BEEN A LONG ?
?? BEEN A LONG DAY ??
?
?? WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG
  BEEN A LONG, BEEN A LONG ?
?? BEEN A LONG DAY ????
HAH !
REALLY, I MEAN IT.
YOU'VE GOTTA SEE THIS.
THIS IS MY OLDER SISTER,
BERNICE.
THE ONE THAT GOT MARRIED
AT 17.  AND THAT'S SAM
AND THE SEVEN CHILDREN.
YES.  PRETTY.
SEVEN !
TOO MANY ?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
NOT ENOUGH ?
NO, I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING--
YOU DON'T LIKE CHILDREN.
ACTUALLY, I COME FROM A
RATHER LARGE FAMILY MYSELF.
I KNOW.  SIX.
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT ?
SMITTY HAD YOUR PERSONNEL FILE
OUT, AND, UH, SHE WAS JUST
CHECKING OFF A FEW--
MAYBE WE BETTER ORDER.
HUH ?
MAYBE WE BETTER ORDER.
OKAY.
ACTUALLY, IT'S INCUMBENT
ON BIG CORPORATIONS TO FIND
BRIGHT, YOUNG MEN.
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT,
BECAUSE ONCE--
HOW DO YOU LIKE
THOSE VEGETABLES ?
WELL, IT'S DELICIOUS.
I DO MY CARROTS IN A BOUILLON
WITH JUST A DOLLOP
OF WORCESTERSHIRE.
DOLLOP ?
JUST GREAT.  I WOULD REALLY
LOVE YOU TO HAVE IT SOMETIME.
WHAT WAS I TALKING ABOUT ?
BEFORE THE DOLLOP.
YOU TAKE THE AVERAGE YOUNG
PERSON TODAY.  THE TROUBLE
IS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR...
INSTANT POETRY,
INSTANT PSYCHOANALYSIS,
INSTANT MASHED POTATOES...
AND INSTANT
OLD-FASHIONED LOVE.
I MEAN, THEY DON'T REALIZE
THAT IT TAKES--
TAKES, UH, TIME TO ESTABLISH
A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP.
DON'T YOU AGREE ?
WELL, NO.  I AGREE WITH
SOME OF THAT, ROSEMARY.
BUT IN THE WORLD OF BUSINESS,
I-- I SEE NO REASON...
WHY A PERSON HAS TO WAIT YEARS
TO BECOME A SUCCESS.
I DON'T KNOW.  IN THE WORLD
OF BUSINESS WHERE OLDER
AND MORE SOPHISTICATED--
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?
THIS IS WHERE I LIVE.
OH !
I'VE GOT MY KEY
IN HERE SOMEPLACE.
HERE YOU GO.
THERE.
THANK YOU.
OH, YOU BETTER GIVE ME THOSE.
THAT HAS THE KEY TO MY DESK,
AND I LOST IT TWICE...
...IN THE LAST--
OH, HERE, HERE.
LET ME.  LET ME GET THOSE.
THANK YOU.  I LOVE TO CURL UP
IN BED WITH A GOOD MAGAZINE.
DON'T YOU ?
ROSEMARY, THIS IS
THE DARNDEST THING !
YOU'RE THE FIRST GIRL
THAT I'VE MET THAT I--
THAT I FEEL I CAN TRUST.
ANYONE WHO CAN CURL UP IN BED

WELL, THAT'S SUBSTANCE.
THANK YOU.
LISTEN, I WANNA--
HERE.  I WANNA THANK YOU
FOR A VERY STIMULATING EVENING.
I DON'T KNOW.  I'VE BEEN
ENJOYING MYSELF SO MUCH THAT
I FORGOT THAT I WAS DEPRESSED.
DEPRESSED ABOUT WHAT ?
I'VE BEEN WORKING SO HARD,
TRYING TO DO MY BEST,
AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE
MY OWN OFFICE YET.

ALL WEEKEND ?
I OUGHT TO KNOW.
 I WAS WITH HIM,
WORKING SIDE BY SIDE !
I HAD NO IDEA, SI--

AND FIRST OF ALL,
I WANT HIM TO HAVE
AN OFFICE OF HIS OWN.
AN OFFICE, SIR ?
HE DESERVES THE BEST

I'LL GET ON IT RIGHT AWAY.

[ Chuckles ]
WELL, THANK YOU.

I MEAN IT'S-- IT'S--
IT'S NOT BAD CONSIDERING.
I DID WANT MY NAME

BUT I DECIDED NOT TO ASK,
'CAUSE THERE'S NO DOOR.
[ Laughing ]
WELL, IT'S BEAUTIFUL,

OH, YES.

I HAD A REAL GOOD TIME
THE OTHER NIGHT.

[ Chuckles ]
I ENJOYED
THE CONVERSATION.
I GUESS
 I TALK TOO MUCH.
WELL, I LIKED IT.
BUT JUST ONE THING,
PONTY, SORT OF BOTHERS ME.
WHAT ?
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED LATER.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE SAID GOOD NIGHT.
I KNOW IT WAS OUR FIRST DATE,
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET
THE WRONG IMPRESSION,
BUT WELL,
I GUESS IT'S ONLY NATURAL
FOR A FELLA TO TRY TO GET
A LITTLE FRESH WITH A GIRL...
AND MAKE A PASS AT HER.
BUT YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING !

EXCUSE ME A MOMENT.
[ Author's Voice ]
CHOOSING A SECRETARY CAN BE
FRAUGHT WITH PERIL.
TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT THE YOUNG LADY WHO
HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO YOU.
IF SHE IS SO ATTRACTIVE
THAT YOU FEEL THINGS
ARE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,
BE VERY CAREFUL.
IT MAY BE THAT ONE OF
THE BIG MEN IN THE COMPANY
IS INTERESTED IN HER CAREER.
THERE'S A SIMPLE TEST FOR THIS:
CHECK ON HER SECRETARIAL SKILL.
THE SMALLER HER ABILITIES,
 THE BIGGER HER PROTECTOR.

YES.
UH, MISS LaRUE,
LET'S TRY SOME DICTATION.
TAKE A LETTER FOR ME.

SO I MATRICULATED MYSELF
INTO BUSINESS SCHOOLING.
WELL, HERE I AM.
OH, YES, YOU ARE.

GO AHEAD, DICTATE SOME MORE,
I'M GONNA LIKE THIS JAZZ.
MISS LaRUE.  HEDY.

THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP.
WEIGH CAREFULLY

YOU'LL GET THE NORMAL
TWO WEEKS SEVERANCE PAY.
OH, AND THE PARTY.
I'VE SCHEDULED YOUR FAREWELL
PARTY FOR TOMORROW AFTERNOON

UH, DON'T YOU FEEL--
GOOD-BYE.

PONTY, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
[ Stammering ]
HE JUST FIRED ME.
JUST LIKE THAT.
EVERYONE IS JUST SHOCKED.
ABSOLUTELY STUNNED.
YOU WERE ADVANCING SO NICELY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
DO YOU KNOW, HE WAS SO
DISPASSIONATE AND COLD.
HE'S--  OH.
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
THAT I COULD NEVER
GET AN ANGLE ON.
LOOK.  LOOK, YOU'RE
HIS SECRETARY.
YOU MUST KNOW...
ONE WEAKNESS THAT HE
HAS, SOME LITTLE ANGLE
THAT I COULD WORK ON.
PONTY, I SWEAR TO YOU,
WE HARDLY KNOW HIM.
NO ONE KNOWS
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.
HE'S THE COMPANY MYSTERY MAN.
BUT, HEY, WHAT ABOUT
HIS PERSONAL PHONE CALLS ?
NO, NO, NO.
HE HAS A PRIVATE TELEPHONE
HE KEEPS LOCKED UP IN A CABINET,
AND HIS PERSONAL PHONE CALLS
NEVER GO THROUGH ME
OR THE SWITCHBOARD.
PONTY, YOU'D HAVE TO BE
A FLY ON THE WINDOWSILL
TO LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'D DO ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD TO HELP.
SAY THAT AGAIN.
I SAID I'D DO
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
TO HELP YOU.
NO, BEFORE THAT.
WHAT DID YOU SAY ?
I SAID,
[ Speaking Together ]
"YOU'D HAVE TO BE A FLY
 ON HIS WINDOWSILL."

IT SHOULD BE DE-ACCENTUATED.
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.
HE MISSED
THE WHOLE POINT.
HE ALWAYS DOES.
HERE'S A NEW APPROACH
TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING.
WELL, THAT IS MORE--
[ Phone Ringing ]
OH, GENTLEMEN, WOULD YOU LEAVE
ME ALONE FOR A FEW MOMENTS ?

SCALED THE TOP.

UNLESS YOU ARE VICE PRESIDENT

IN THAT CASE,
YOU'RE IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE.
THERE IS ONE THING
THAT CAN SAVE YOU.
YOU MUST GET
A BRILLIANT IDEA.

YOU DON'T NEED AN IDEA.
NO, I DON'T NEED IT.
LET ME LEAVE IT WITH YOU,
AND IF YOU GET A CHANCE,
LOOK IT OVER.
YEAH.
BECAUSE THE MEETING'S
IN A FEW LITTLE WHILE.
I MEAN, IT'S SOON.
[ Makes Cutting Sound ]
WHAT DID YOUR UNCLE SAY
WHEN, UM-- WHEN YOU TOLD
IT TO HIM ?
I HAVEN'T TOLD IT TO J.B.
IF I BROUGHT IT TO HIM,
HE WOULDN'T LISTEN.
THAT'S WHY
I BROUGHT IT TO YOU.
YOU NEVER MENTIONED THIS
TO YOUR UNCLE AT ALL ?
NO, PONTY.
BUT HOW CAN I BELIEVE THAT ?
AN IDEA LIKE THIS ?
NO, PONTY.
IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED,
THAT'S ONE THING--
NO, ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL--
HMM.
WELL, I'LL GIVE IT
A BIT OF A THINK THING.
MULL IT AROUND A BIT.
FEEL FREE TO USE IT.
"TREASURE HUNT."
ARE YOU PREGNANT
OR SOMETHING ?
HEDY, I TOLD
YOU NEVER TO COME--
I DID NOT INTEND
TO EMBARRASS YOU, I JUST
CAME FOR A BUSINESS PURPOSE.
BUSINESS ?
I WISH TO TENDER YOU
WITH MY RESIGNATION.
YOUR RESIGNATION ?
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
HEDY !
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.
J.B., J.B., J.B. !
OH, I'M SORRY.
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT ?
J.B., DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT TELEVISION IDEA
I TOLD YOU ABOUT,
THE TREASURE HUNT ?
I'VE TOLD YOU WHAT I THOUGHT
OF THAT STUPID IDEA.
I JUST WANTED TO REMIND YOU
THAT YOU HATED IT.
OUT !
YOU DO HATE IT.
I'M GOING, I'M GOING, I'M GOING.
I SAID, OUT !
NOW, WHAT IS THIS
RESIGNATION NONSENSE ?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?
I DON'T KNOW.
ALL I KNOW IS, I AM
CLEARING OUT OF HERE !
I AM BEGINNING TO ROT IN
THAT SECRETARIAL POOL.
NOT ONE PERSON WILL
USE ME AS HIS SECRETARY.
THEY STAY AWAY FROM ME,
LIKE I HAD AN EXTREMELY
TROPICAL DISEASE.
JUST BE PATIENT.  I PROMISE
WE'LL FIND A SPOT FOR YOU.
PROMISES, PROMISES, PROMISES.
BUT NO ACTION.
NO, NO, NO.
I AM FED UP WITH
THAT SECRETARIAL POOL.
I'LL GIVE YOU
24 HOURS.  AFTER THAT,
IT'S GOOD-BYE WICKETS,
HELLO SOMEBODY
WHO CAN DO ME
SOMETHING FOR REAL !
HEDY, ON MY WORD OF HONOR
AS A GENTLEMAN,
I PROMISE YOU'LL BE OUT

AFRAID OF FINCH.

HE'LL PROBABLY HAVE US ALL
WORKING IN THE MAIL ROOM.
GOOD LUCK TO US.
HI, MEN !
HELLO, BUD.
HI, BUD.
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ?
CHAPS,
OUR WORRIES ARE OVER.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
OH, I'M SO HAPPY I COULD CRY !
FINCH IS GOING AHEAD WITH--
WHAT ?
WELL, BELIEVE ME,
HE'S DEAD, DEAD, DEAD.
OH, I'M GLAD
TO HEAR THAT.
I DON'T KNOW.
FINCH HAS A WAY OF BOUNCING.
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE HE WAS DEAD
EVEN IF I READ HIS OBITUARY.
OH, YOU MAY BE RIGHT.
ORDINARILY,
I'D AGREE WITH YOU.
FINCH IS VERY SMART.
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THAT
HE'S NOW INADVERTISING.
[ Chuckles ]
AND THAT DOES SOMETHING
TO MEN'S BRAINS.
UH, FRED !
FRED, I'LL SEE YOU

GOOD AFTERNOON.
UH, THANK YOU.
GENTLEMEN,
I'D LIKE TO PRESENT...
MY NEW APPROACH
TO WICKET ADVERTISING,
WHICH IN MY HUMBLE OPINION--
I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT !
SOUNDS PROMISING.
PROCEED, FINCH.
THANK YOU.
[ Clicking ]
[ J.B. ]
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ?
THAT IS A PICTURE
OF MOUNT VESUVIUS
IN ERUPTION,
WHICH GIVES YOU THE IMPACT
THAT OUR NEW TELEVISION SHOW
IS GOING TO HAVE.
NOW, J.B., THE TYPE
OF NATIONAL PUBLICITY
THAT YOU...
AND, WELL, YOU ALONE
CAN LOOK FORWARD TO:
[ Finch ]
THE COVER OFTIMEMAGAZINE.
[ J.B. ]  OH, YES, YES !
YES, AND THE COVER
OFNEWSWEEK.
DELIGHTFUL !
AND FINALLY, J.B.,
THE GOLFER OF THE YEAR.
BRAVO, J.B.,
YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.
THANK YOU.
NOW, GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS A MAP OF
THE POTENTIAL WICKET MARKET.
IT'S DIVIDED INTO
SOCIAL, GEOGRAPHIC
AND ETHNIC GROUPS.
[ Executives ]
ETHNIC ?
ETHNIC.
IT SHOWS HOW...
WE WILL MAKE DEEP PENETRATION,
OVERWHELMING SATURATION
INTO THOSE AREAS...
WHICH HAVE LONG REMAINED,
UH, PEAKIEST !
[ J.B. ]
I LIKE THIS THINKING !
NOW, THIS IS A SALES CHART.
THIS IS A SALES CHART
OF THE PAST FISCAL YEAR,
WHICH REFLECTS
THE DISASTROUS EFFECT OF OUR
FORMER ADVERTISING POLICY...
IN TERMS OF PER CAPITA
CONSUMPTION OF WICKETS.
NOTE, GENTLEMEN,
THE SHARP DECLINE
FROM NORMAL REGULARITY.
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.
BUT THIS IS WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO OUR SALES...
AFTER MY NEW TELEVISION PROGRAM
SEEPS INTO THE PUBLIC MIND.
- [ Clicking, Roaring ]
- UP, UP, UP !
UP, UP, UP.
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.
WHOO !
[ Executives Grumbling ]
FINCH, I THINK YOU'VE
DONE IT.  VERY GOOD.
THANK YOU, SIR.
YES, YES, YES.
CAN I ASK A QUESTION,
J.B. ?
NOT "CAN I," DAMN IT, "MAY I."
YOU WENT TO COLLEGE.
MAYI ASK A QUESTION ?
YOU MAY.
WHAT'S HIS IDEA ?
YOU HEARD.  IT'S A TELEVISION
SHOW, DESIGNED TO GIVE US
PENETRATION AND PEAK REACTION.
DON'T YOU EVER LISTEN ?
SOUNDS GREAT, FINCH, GREAT.
DOESN'T IT, MEN ?
[ Executives Agreeing ]
[ Clanging ]
[ Chuckling ]
BUT WHAT IS HISIDEA
FOR THE SHOW ?
I DON'T SEE WHY
YOU HAVE TO BE
SO DAMNED NEGATIVE.
THE ONLY THINGS YOU EVER
COME UP WITH ARE LOUSY IDEAS
LIKE TREASURE HUNTS !
ALL RIGHT, FINCH,
WHAT IS THE IDEA FOR THE SHOW ?
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING
TO TELL IT TO YOU.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
- YOU KNOW, J.B.,
  LOOK, I'VE--
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF YOU
AS A MAN OF, UH--
A MAN OF
PERSPICACITY AND VISION.
OPEN TO NEW IDEAS !
BUT NOW I--  [ Chuckles ]
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M THROWN.
BY WHAT ?
THE WAY YOU TALKED TO BUD !
ABOUT HIS IDEA.
FOR A TREASURE HUNT.
YOU DISMISSED IT.
THERE ARE TREASURE HUNTS
AND TREASUREHUNTS.
AND AT FIRST--  AT FIRST
I THOUGHT BUD'S IDEA...
WAS A ROTTEN IDEA
MYSELF.
BUT GENTLEMEN,
IN THE FIELD OF MEDICINE,
THERE WERE MEN LIKE...
HIPPOCRATES, UH,
LOUIS PASTEUR,
SIGMUND FREUD,
JONAS SALK.
GENTLEMEN, THEY ALL HAD
BRILLIANT IDEAS, BUT IT TOOK
MODERN TECHNOLOGY...
TO TAKE ALL THESE IDEAS
AND DEVELOP THEM INTO
A GREAT TELEVISION PROGRAM.
- LIKEDR. KILDARE.
- [ Chuckling, Chattering ]
THE PUBLIC ALWAYS LOVES
A SHOW WHERE SOMEONE
WINS A LOT OF MONEY.
AND THE FIRST ONE
WHO COMES UP WITH A--
WITH A NEW, AN UNRIGGED,
AN UNFIXED WAY TO GIVE AWAY
SOMETHING FOR NOTHING...
IS GOING TO SWEEP
THE AIRWAVES.
IT CAN'T BE DONE, J.B.
[ J.B. ]
CAN'T BE DONE.
BUT IF IT COULD, J.B.
IF IT COULD.
WOULDN'T IT CREATE
TREMENDOUS EXCITEMENT ?
IT CAN'T BE DONE !
BUT IF IT COULD !
BUT IT CAN'T.
JUST FOR A MOMENT,
SAY, "IT COULD BE DONE."
NOW, WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER ?
I FORGOT THE QUESTION !
[ Chuckling, Chattering ]
I HATE GIVEAWAY SHOWS.
THEY LACK DIGNITY.
PLEASE, BE PATIENT.

WE'RE GOING TO NEED A--
YOU KNOW, WE'LL NEED
A BIG NAME PERSONALITY.
SOMEONE LIKE, UH,
ELIZABETH TAYLOR.
WHY DON'T YOU GET
QUEEN ELIZABETH ?

GOING TO BE HIDDEN ?

IS GOING TO KNOW WHERE
THE TREASURE IS HIDDEN.
I MEAN, WHOEVER SHE MAY BE.
I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT WILL KNOW, SIR.

DON'T YOU THINK I SHOULD KNOW ?
YES.  WELL, I'M GONNA HIDE

HAS BEEN NO FIXING OR RIGGING
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SHOW ?
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER ?
SHE LOOKED
SURPRISED.
YES, SHE IS.
HEDY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.
I WANTED THIS PART OF THE SHOW
TO BE COMPLETELY SPONTANEOUS
AND SORT OF UNREHEARSED.
THAT CAN BE
VERY DANGEROUS.
DO YOU SWEAR THAT YOU
YOURSELF DO NOT KNOW...
WHERE THE TREASURE
IS ACTUALLY HIDDEN ?
IS THIS A REAL BIBLE ?
[ Audience Gasping ]
YES, THIS
IS A REAL BIBLE.
YOU SEE, WE'RE GOING

MR. BIGGLEY'S WAITING.
MISS JONES,
HAVE YOU SEEN PONTY ?
NO.
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR HIM.
OH, POOR BABY.
I'VE GOT TO FIND HIM.
HE WAS A NICE BOY,
BUT SOMEBODY'S HEAD
HAS TO ROLL.
[ Author's Voice ]
HOW TO HANDLE A DISASTER.
IN EVERY BUSINESSMAN'S CAREER,
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN
EVERYTHING GOES WRONG.
THIS IS A TIME
FOR MAINTAINING A COOL HEAD...
AND FOLLOWING
THE ONE, SIMPLE RULE:
PUT THE BLAME
ON SOMEBODY ELSE.
OH, PONTY !
I'VE BEEN WORRIED TO DEATH.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ?
I'VE BEEN JUST
WALKING THE STREETS.
I'VE JUST BEEN
THINKING, THINKING--
WELL--
OH, YOU'VE GOT
A BRUISE ON YOUR HEAD.
I KNOW !
I KNOW,
I GOT IT LAST NIGHT.
THEY--
WELL, THEY THREW ME
OUT OF A SALOON.
WHY'D THEY DO THAT ?
I DIDN'T BUY ANYTHING.
THE BRUTES.
OH, PONTY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ?
I WAS SO WORRIED, AND EVERYONE'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.
YES, I BET.
I'M GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT.
BUT BEFORE THEY FIND ME,
I HAVE TO READ UP ON HOW
TO HANDLE THIS DISASTER.
READ UP ?
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
WELL, I MIGHT AS WELL
TELL YOU.  SEE, BEFORE
I CAME TO THIS COMPANY,
I WAS A--
WHAT WERE YOU ?
I WAS A WINDOW WASHER.
THEN I CAME ACROSS
THIS BOOK.
HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS.
IT JUST MUST EXPLAIN
HOW TO PUT THE BLAME
ON SOMEONE ELSE.
OH, PONTY, YOU WOULDN'T.
THAT'S DISHONEST.
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.
YOU'VE GOT TO GO IN THERE
AND FACE THE MUSIC.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT'S LIKE
IN BIG BUSINESS.
THEY-- THEY'D FIRE ME.
I'D HAVE TO GO BACK
TO WASHING WINDOWS.
PONTY, I COULDN'T LOVE
A MAN WHO WASN'T HONEST.
IF YOU DON'T
MAKE A CLEAN BREAST
OF EVERYTHING,
I'LL NEVER HAVE
ANY RESPECT FOR YOU.
ROSEMARY, LOOK.
IT'S NO LIFE FOR YOU,
BEING MARRIED TO A--
A WINDOW WASHER.
PONTY,
ARE YOU GONNA GO IN THERE
AND FACE THEM HONESTLY OR NOT ?
GOOD-BYE, PONTY.
[ Footsteps Receding ]
ROSEMARY, WAIT !
ROSEMARY, WAIT !
 ROSEMARY !
AHA !  FINCH, YOU'RE WANTED
IN J.B.'S OFFICE.
YEAH, WELL, I THOUGHT
I'D WASH UP FIRST.
THEY WANT YOU NOW.
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.
LET ME TELL YOU BEFORE WE GO
ANY FURTHER.  I'M THE PRESIDENT
OF THIS COMPANY,
THE MAN WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR EVERYTHING
THAT GOES ON HERE.
I WANT TO STATE RIGHT NOW
THAT ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED
IS NOT MY FAULT !
[ Sighs ]
THERE'S ONE BRIGHT SIDE
TO THIS THING, WALLY.
YOU'LL BE HAPPY
TO KNOW WE'VE SOMEONE
WE CAN PIN IT ON.
YOU'LL SOON SEE
WHERE THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THIS WHOLE THING LIES.
WHEN FINCH GETS HERE,
I'LL DO ALL THE TALKING.
THIS IS A VERY SLICK
YOUNGSTER, WALLY.
[ Chattering ]
HERE HE IS NOW.
ALL RIGHT.
MR. BIGGLEY, PLEASE--
I'LL DO ALL THE TALKING.
BY THE WAY, YOU HAVEN'T MET
MR. WOMPER.  THIS IS
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.
HOW DO YOU DO, MR. WOMPER.
MR. WOMPER--
NO SPEECHES.
IT'S ALL SETTLED.
I WANT YOU TO SIGN
A LETTER OF RESIGNATION...
IN WHICH YOU ACCEPT
ALL THE BLAME
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.
[ Whispering ]
ROSEMARY.
WHAT ?
ALL RIGHT, MR. BIGGLEY, I--
ALL RIGHT.  I'LL BE GLAD
TO SIGN THE RESIGNATION.
IS THIS ONE
OF YOUR TRICKS ?
NO, MR. BIGGLEY.
I'M THROUGH WITH ALL THAT.
TH-THIS FIRM HAS BEEN
PRETTY GOOD TO ME.
NOW, I'M JUST GOING TO RESIGN.
I'M GONNA TAKE THE BLAME...
AND GO BACK TO WHAT I DID
BEFORE I CAME HERE.
- WHAT DID YOU DO, FINCH ?
- [ Sighs ]
- I WAS A WINDOW WASHER.
- NO KIDDIN' !
I STARTED AS
A WINDOW WASHER MYSELF !
[ Chattering ]
YOUWERE
 A WINDOW WASHER ?
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU THINK I WAS,
A RAIL-SPLITTER ?
[ Chuckles ]
COLLEGE MAN.
SO YOU WERE A WINDOW WASHER ?
CALL ME WALLY.
YES, MR. WOMPER.
OKAY, WALLY.
WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME PONTY ?
TELL ME, FINCH--
OKAY, PONTY.  IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD ANYBODY
AROUND HERE I COULD TALK TO.
HOW'D YOU HAPPEN TO GO
INTO THIS BUSINESS ?
WELL, SIR--
LET ME TELL YA,
I HAD A BOOK--
ME TOO.
IT WAS A BOOK ON
HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS.
MY BOOK WAS MORE USEFUL.
I BOOKED BETS FOR ALL
THE OTHER WINDOW WASHERS.
CLEANED UP A BUNDLE.
SHOULD HAVE STOOD
IN THAT BUSINESS.
EIGHT BUILDINGS WRECKED,
OUR STOCK IS DOWN FIVE POINTS !
- WE'RE THE LAUGHINGSTOCK
  OF THE INDUSTRY.
- UGH !  I KNOW, WALLY.
- IT'S GHASTLY.
- PONTY, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN ?
I COULD UNDERSTAND A COLLEGE MAN
PULLING A BONER LIKE THIS,
BUT NOT NO WINDOW WASHER !
NOW, THIS IDEA OF YOURS
ABOUT A TREASURE HUNT--
NOW, HOLD IT, WALLY.
LOOK, IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT I WON'T DO,
IT'S TAKE CREDIT
FOR ANOTHER MAN'S IDEA.
ESPECIALLY WHEN
HE'S THE BOSS'S NEPHEW.
[ Nonchalant Chattering ]
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
 YOU HIRED YOUR NEPHEW.
NEPHEW ?  OH, NEPHEW.
HE'S NOT REALLY MY NEPHEW,
HE'S MY WIFE'S NEPHEW.
I NEVER SHOWED HIM
ANY FAVORITISM.
IN FACT, I HATE HIM.
BUT YOU LOVE HIS IDEAS.
NO, WHEN HE TOLD ME THE IDEA,
I THOUGHT IT WAS A LOUSY IDEA.
WHEN FINCH BROUGHT IT
TO ME, I STILL SAID
IT WAS A LOUSY IDEA.
IN FACT, I TOLD FINCH
IT WAS A LOUSY IDEA !
WHY DID YOU BUY IT ?
SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA.
TREASURE HUNT,
 TREASURE GIRL.
FINCH DRESSED IT ALL UP.
HE CAN'T DENY THAT THE IDEA
OF THE TREASURE GIRL...
WAS HIS !
[ Executives Agreeing ]
WALLY, THAT WAS MY IDEA.
AND NOT A BAD ONE,
PONTY.
BUT WHO THE HELL PICKED
THAT BUBBLE-HEADED TOMATO ?
[ Executives Murmuring ]
[ Clears Throat ]
AHA !
DON'T GET ANY WRONG IDEAS,
WALLY.  SHE'S A FINE GIRL.
YOU SHOULD HAVE
A TALK WITH HER.
I INTEND TO.
WELL, I THINK I GOT
THE WHOLE PICTURE.
NOW, THE QUESTION
IS WHAT TO DO
AND WHO TO DO IT TO.
WALLY, BEFORE YOU MAKE
ANY HASTY DECISIONS, I'D--
WELL, I'D LIKE TO SAY
A FEW WORDS.
ABOUT WHAT ?
ABOUT, WELL--
 ABOUT HUMANITY.
OH !
NO, LOOK, EVEN THOUGH
WE'RE ALL PART OF
THE COLD, CORPORATE SETUP,
DEEP DOWN UNDER OUR SKINS
THERE'S FLESH AND BLOOD.
- WE'RE ALL BROTHERS.
- BUT SOME OF US ARE UNCLES !
?? NOW YOU MAY JOIN
  THE ELKS, MY FRIEND ??
?? AND I MAY JOIN
  THE SHRINERS ??
?? AND OTHER MEN
  MAY CARRY CARDS ??
?? AS MEMBERS
  OF THE DINERS ??
?? STILL OTHERS WEAR
  A GOLDEN KEY ??
?? OR SMALL
  GREEK LETTER PIN ??
?? BUT I HAVE LEARNED
  THERE'S ONE GREAT CLUB ??
?? THAT ALL OF US ARE IN ??
?? THERE IS
  A BROTHERHOOD ??
?? OF MAN ??
??
?? A BENEVOLENT BROTHERHOOD
?? OF MAN ??
?? A NOBLE TIE THAT BINDS ??
?? ALL HUMAN HEARTS
  AND MINDS ??
?? INTO A BROTHERHOOD OF MAN ??
?? YOUR LIFELONG MEMBERSHIP ??
?? IS FREE ??
?? KEEP A-GIVIN'
  EACH BROTHER ALL ??
?? YOU CAN ??
?? OH, AREN'T
  YOU PROUD TO BE ??
?? IN THAT FRATERNITY ??
?? THE GREAT BIG
  BROTHERHOOD OF MAN ??
NOW, WALLY, I WANT YOU
TO REMEMBER THAT BEFORE
YOU CONSIDER FIRING MR. BIGGLEY.
WHO'S CONSIDERING THAT ?
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE !
YOU SEE, I KNOW WHAT'S
ON YOUR MIND.  YOU'D LIKE
TO CLEAR OUT THE WHOLE PLACE.
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.
IT'S THE OBVIOUS MOVE,
BUT STOP AND THINK.
?? ONE MAN
  MAY SEEM INCOMPETENT ??
?? ANOTHER NOT MAKE SENSE ??
?? WHILE OTHERS LOOK
  LIKE QUITE A WASTE ??
?? OF COMPANY EXPENSE ??
?? THEY NEED
