They are an army unlike any other...
crusading across the stars
toward a place called UnderVerse,
their promised land...
a constellation of dark new worlds.
Necromongers, they're called.
And if they cannot convert you,
they will kill you.
Leading them, the Lord Marshal.
He alone has made a pilgrimage
to the gates of the UnderVerse...
and returned a different being.
Stronger. Stranger.
Half alive and half...
something else.
If we are to survive,
a new balance must be found.
In normal times,
evil would be fought by good.
But in times like these, well,
it should be fought
by another kind of evil.
Linin' him up for you. Port-side shot
comin' up. Steady. Here we go.
Steady.
Take it. Take it!
Take the shot!
Shit!
Toombs, we're runnin' out of road!
Shut up! I got it! Again!
Now!
Riddick.
I don't know, Toombs.
Looks kinda tight.
Not where I'm sittin'.
This is the biggest payday ever,
So throw on a fresh pair of panties.
Let's get this right.
Three meters clearance port-side.
One and a half meters starboard.
We got a choke point comin' up.
What the shit was that?
Tags, you got eyes on Riddick?
Tags?
Jesus.
He just ghosted two guys,
and I never even saw him.
- What do you think, Toombs? I mean, maybe we oughta just...
- I think you're my new gunner.
Grab a Gat.
Stay on top of him this time.
You made three mistakes.
First, you took the job.
Second, you came light.
A four-man crew for me?
Fuckin' insulting.
But the worst mistake you made...
Empty gun rack.
- What's the bounty on my head?
- One mil.
- One-point-five.
- What slam pays 1.5 for a convict?
Private party.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Guy, guy! Easy! Anonymous.
- That's what the sheet said.
- What planet?
Helion Prime.
Whoa. Where you goin'?
Last question.
And you better get this one right, merc.
Whose ship is this?
Mine?
Knew they'd come for me.
Took 'em five years, but I knew.
You don't expect these mercs
to have any honor, any code.
But this new bounty from a holy man,
a guy whose neck I saved...
Well, lesson learned.
No such word as "friend."
Can only end bad
when you let someone get too close.
Bad for them.
So now it's back to all the brightness...
and everything I hate.
Wonder if she'll be there.
Act like an animal and I'm gonna slot you
up like one. This one is always in trouble.
I knew it!
I smell it.
Get in there!
Can we shut the goddamn noise?
They say most of your brain
shuts down in cryosleep.
Brain shuts down in cryosleep.
- All but the primitive side.
- All but the primitive side.
The animal side.
All but the Furyan side.
Some of us still remember the true
crime that happened here on Furya.
And once you wake...
truly wake...
you'll remember too.
Helion Prime is on alert condition four.
Unrecognized craft. You need to follow me
to Spaceport 6 for security inspections.
Hey! Do you hear me?
Follow me to Spaceport Six now!
Imam, pray for us.
It was confirmed
two seasons back. Yes.
They're coming here.
I mean, are we next?
Militants storm...
Yes. But going to the underground
shelters if it happens...
You're right.
That's what I thought too.
Are you staying or leaving?
It's the end of everything.
Everything!
- Well, my neighbors...
- Half my street is gone.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know. I don't know.
Hood of the devil.
That's what someone called 'em.
Them? Who is them?
Some kind of new creature...
This is nonsense.
It's all nonsense.
So tall that it touches the clouds.
And there's nothing around this statue,
this colossus. Nothing left.
It's their calling card.
Did you know all your doors were locked?
Five years ago,
I took two people off that planet...
A kid, Jack,
who everyone else thought was a boy,
and a holy man...
searching for New Mecca.
Your wife...
She's in the shower.
I told one man...
where I might go.
I showed trust to one man.
Did I make a mistake, Imam?
There is no simple answer.
Whatever was said
was meant to give us a chance...
a fighting chance.
Were it not for the threat of invasion,
I never would have betrayed you.
I give you my word, Riddick.
Riddick!
Riddick!
And a daughter...
- No!
- ...whose name would be...
If you have issue with me,
you let it be with me.
- You need not know their names.
- Ziza.
My name is Ziza.
Ziza.
- Cute kid.
- Did you really kill monsters?
The ones that were gonna
hurt my father?
Such are our bedtime stories.
Go, Ziza. Go on!
So now who do I have to kill
to get this payday off my head?
It is said the comet
always precedes them...
these world-enders.
The Coalsack planets are gone.
Eight million settlers missing.
The entire Aquilan System is gone too.
Helion Prime shares its sunlight
with all worlds nearby.
If we fall, they fall.
And after that...
My God,
how do I save my family?
Have you heard anything I've said?
You said it's all circling the
drain... the whole universe.
Right?
That's right.
Had to end sometime.
The one you want is now here.
And whose throat is this?
If you cut my throat, I'll not be able to
rescind the offer that brought you here.
Nor tell you why it's so vital
that you did come.
The blade comes off
when the bounty comes off.
This is Aereon,
an envoy from the Elemental race.
She means you no harm.
There are very few of us who have met a
Necromonger and lived to speak of it.
So when I choose to speak of it,
you should choose to listen.
Necromonger.
It is the name that will convert
or kill every last human life...
unless the universe
can rebalance itself.
Maybe you should pretend like you're talkin'
to someone educated in the penal system.
In fact, don't pretend.
Balance is everything
to elementals.
Water to fire.
Earth to air.
We have 33 different words for it.
But now we have only time
to speak of the balance of opposites.
There is a story, Riddick,
of young male Furyans...
strangled at birth...
strangled with their own cords.
When Aereon told this story
to the Helion leaders,
I told her of you.
- What do you know of your early years?
- Do you remember your home world?
- Where it was?
- Have you met any others?
Others like yourself.
Sister, they don't know
what to do with just one of me.
Open up in there!
- Stand back!
- Open up!
They are searching houses!
Shh!
They look for a man who came here today.
They think he might be a spy.
- A spy?
- Did someone see him come here today?
Did they?
Lajjun, stop!
We're sure he's in there! I will send
them away. But wait one minute, please.
Will you wait one minute
to save worlds?
Not my fight.
So, you will leave us
to our fate,
just like you did her.
Break it down!
Get him!
Come. Let us try to send them away.
- Move it. Come on.
- Leave us alone!
There is no one here!
You don't understand.
He can help us! He can help us!
Go!
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?
- Get him!
- Where is he?
In there!
You mentioned her.
She, uh...
She went looking for you.
People died.
She went to prison.
I... I don't remember where.
But it was a world so hot
you not survive on the surface.
Crematoria.
Young Jack.
She thought of you
as her older brother.
She worshipped you.
You were supposed to watch her.
She never forgave you...
for leaving just when
she needed you most.
She needed to stay away from me.
You all do.
Riddick.
Are you gonna stop
the new monsters now?
Furyans.
Defiant to the end.
No, no.
We go to the shelter.
We take only ourselves.
Stay close.
No!
Flight leaders, get all squads
off the ground now.
We have heavy inbound.
Follow me in!
The next shelter.
This way!
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!
I'll see if it's safe.
- Stay back!
- Come, Ziza.
Come!
You following me?
Lajjun and Ziza!
- When it's over.
- Let me go. I must get to my family!
When it's over.
I borrowed a ship.
You can ride along,
if you don't mind riding with a convict.
I thank you, but I must get
my family across the river.
God willing, there is still
a shelter I can get them...
I'm sure God has his tricks,
but getting out of places
no one else can,
that's one of mine.
Let's get your family.
Aah!
In here.
Get in.
Shh.
- Imam!
- Don't follow me.
There will be
an afterlife for me.
Will there be for you?
Let's go replenish the ranks.
Never fails to inspire, does it?
Each time a dynasty falls.
Remember your place,
Dame Vaako.
My place is at your side,
dear husband.
From here till UnderVerse come.
In this 'verse,
life is antagonistic
to the natural state.
Here, humans in all
their various races...
are a spontaneous outbreak...
an unguided mistake.
Our purpose...
is to correct that mistake.
Because there is another 'verse...
a 'verse where life
is welcomed and cherished.
A ravishing, ever-new place
called UnderVerse.
But the road to that 'verse...
crosses over the threshold.
Threshold!
Take us to the threshold!
What you call... death.
So it is this 'verse
that must be cleansed of life,
so that UnderVerse
can populate and prosper.
Look around you.
Every Necromonger in this hall,
every one of the Legion Vast that just
swept aside your defenses in one night...
was once like you.
Fought as feebly as you.
Every Necromonger
that lives today...
is a convert.
- There'll be no conversions!
- We all began as something else!
It was hard for me to accept, too,
when I first heard these words.
But I changed.
I let them take away my pain.
- You betrayed your faith!
- Just as you will change...
when you realize that the threshold
to the UnderVerse will be crossed...
only by those who have
embraced the Necromonger faith.
For those of you
who will right now...
drop to your knees
and ask to be purified.
We will not renounce our faith!
No one here will do what you ask.
It is unthinkable!
This is a world of many peoples,
many religions!
And we simply cannot
and will not be converted!
Then I'll take your soul.
Join him...
or join me.
This is your one chance.
Take the Lord Marshal's offer
and bow.
I bow to no man.
He's not a man.
He's the holy Half-Dead
who has seen the UnderVerse.
Look, I'm not
with everyone here.
But I will take a piece of him.
A piece you will have.
Stop him!
Irgun. One of my best.
If you say so.
What do you think of this blade?
I think it's a half-gram heavy
on the back end.
In our faith,
you keep what you kill.
Are you familiar to me?
Have we met
on some distant field?
You'd think I'd remember.
You'd think I would too.
Take him before the Quasi-Deads.
Perhaps the breeder
would do it...
if somebody just asked him.
It is a rare offer.
A visit inside Necropolis.
It's been a long time
since I smelled beautiful.
Let me show you the way.
Beautiful eyes.
Come.
The last six Lord Marshals
have called this home.
Magnificent, isn't it?
I might have gone a different way.
True of us all.
Converts receiving the mark
of the Necromonger.
They learn how one pain
can lessen another.
There now.
That is just... perfect.
The more you resist them,
the greater the damage will be.
A new one.
You've brought us the one.
Interesting breeder.
Making entry.
This won't take long.
We've entered his neocortex.
- Ahh! The Riddick!
- Regress.
Scanning fresh memories.
Thoughts of someone called Jack.
Riddick!
She went to prison.
Now we find thoughts of an Elemental.
The one race that would slow
the spread of Necromongers.
Furyans.
Where does he come from?
Who are his people?
These are the things I need to know.
We find energy.
You must settle your past.
We find Furyan energy.
- For all of us.
- He's Furyan!
Furyan!
A Furyan survivor!
Look at our world, at the graves of those
who didn't escape 30 years ago.
There is no future
until we settle our past...
for all of us
who bear the mark.
Kill the Furyan! Kill the Riddick!
Kill the Riddick! Kill the Riddick!
Kill the Riddick!
Kill the Riddick!
Kill the Riddick.
Who is this man?
Find him. Whatever it takes. Find him!
Let me guess.
A five-man crew this time.
Couple of things
you could have done better.
First, trash the locator beacon
inside my ship... the one you jacked.
And second ...and this is really
the more important part...
dust my dick
when you get the chance.
- Any questions?
- Yeah.
What took you so long?
Let's go, big boy.
In and out, unsuspected and undetected.
Damn, I love a good smash-and-grab.
Not so fast. Not so fast.
Dickheads.
We're pickin' up fields here.
Unknown fields detected on hull.
I knew it. Here it comes.
This is some kind of scan.
I don't know.
Readin' our Btus, maybe?
- Let's drop one.
- Dropping.
Decoy launched.
Preparing to engage ion drive.
So,
where do we drop
your merc-killin' ass?
Who's gonna pay
the most for you now?
- Butcher Bay?
- Butcher Bay.
Ten minutes every other day
on the dog run.
Protein waffles aren't bad.
Hey, how 'bout Ursa Luna?
Nice little double-max prison.
They keep a cell open for me...
just in case I drop in.
You know the problem
with these joints now?
Health clubs
for waffle-eatin' pussies.
Maybe we should think about
uppin' our game here a little bit.
Think about someplace
truly diabolical.
What the hell is he thinkin' now?
He's thinkin' a triple-max prison.
A no-daylight slam.
Only three of 'em left in this system...
two of 'em outta range for a shitty little
undercutter like this one with no legs.
Leavin' just... one...
Crematoria.
That is what you had in mind,
right, Toombs?
- Hey, how does he know where we're goin', and we don't?
- Dope it out.
- I hate this run.
- Just do it!
Don't know about this
new crew of yours.
They seem a bit skittish.
Probably shouldn't tell 'em
what happened to the last crew.
You know, you supposed
to be some slick-shit killer.
Now look at you...
all back-of-the-bus
and shit.
I say we attack Helion Two next.
Take it straight
into their teeth.
It'll cost you 20,000 heads, five
warrior ships. Nothing more, I swear it.
While I do prize brute force,
this approach
is perhaps more artful.
Start at the end.
Go straight to Helion Five,
the last planet in the system.
We approach from the night side.
Remove these cannon first,
then attack
the larger placements at speed.
We'll catch them on their rear flank.
And in ten days' time,
the rest of those worlds
will tumble before us.
You see, as with most,
their blind spot...
is right behind them.
I've located an ion trail
which leads off-world.
Then you should be
off-world, Vaako.
I've deployed a tracker team.
One of the best.
Wherever Riddick has gone,
you lens him out and cleanse him.
- You.
- You want me to take a frigate for one breeder?
Don't question it, Vaako!
Take it on faith.
He's always been unsettled around you...
the Lord Marshal.
Unsteady.
Perhaps because he knows
he's half the warrior you are.
Some say he's too artistic
for the job.
I wouldn't be surprised
if someone promoted him soon...
to full dead.
Take care what you say.
Should I say it softly?
So it sounds more
like conspiracy?
Oh, why is it that when anyone breathes
about the demise of him on the throne...
everyone assumes
a conspiracy?
Why isn't that
just prudent planning?
When he is ready,
he will name a successor.
Who?
Toal? Scales? The Purifier?
None of them...
with the strength,
the dignity,
of Lord Vaako.
You can keep what you kill.
- Stop.
- That is the Necromonger way.
I said... stop.
His death will come in due time
and not a moment sooner.
- Why?
- Because I serve him. We all serve him. It's called fidelity.
It's called stupidity.
Well, finally some attention.
You have such greatness in you.
If only you could see it like I do.
You know what I want?
Today I came up behind him
in perfect silence and he knew.
I wanna go down
in Necropolis.
Right now.
His half-dead soul sensed I was
behind him. He sees everything.
When no one is looking...
when no one's around...
I'm gonna get down on my knees...
while you sit on the throne.
- How unexpected.
- An Elemental.
Here.
One of the captives.
And why, after 30 years,
should it be you?
He doesn't regard her
as a captive, though.
Elementals...
they talk of neutrality,
but they're all witches
and spies.
Why else would they
come and go like the wind?
But where has he gone?
Where is the Furyan hiding now?
You be the good warrior.
Go after this Riddick.
I'll find out why the Lord Marshal
is so threatened by him.
Do you know
you grind your teeth at night?
Sexy.
Destination reached.
Unlocking manual controls.
All right. I make 700 degrees
on the day side,
300 below on the night side.
Let's not get caught in the sun.
If I owned this place and hell,
I'd rent this place out
and live in hell.
- Blue angle... good.
- Stand by.
And...
Plotted course good.
Hit it!
Angle of approach, not good.
Look, Ma. No hands!
Party poppers!
I think I shit myself.
Skittish, Toombs. Very skittish.
Comfy?
When the ride's over,
your goggles are mine.
Four-way split!
29.4 kilometers.
So, this is Riddick.
What in the bowels of Christ
are you talkin' about, 700K?
Don't take this one, boss.
See? Anatoli here
has a nose for trouble.
And this one, this Riddick guy...
Big, big trouble.
So, 700,000 is good money.
I'd take the money, Toombs.
The guild pays us a caretaker's fee
for each prisoner each year.
We pay mercs 20% of that total fee
based on a certain life expectancy.
How's about this?
You open that safe you got hidden
behind the console there,
show me the real books,
then we figure out my cut.
Then I'll be on my way.
Open my books.
This is what you suggest?
Wasn't a suggestion.
These are dangerous days,
if you believe the talk.
Talk?
About dead planets.
About some ghost army.
About them.
"Them"?
I'll run the numbers again.
It takes a couple of days,
probably,
so you can stay as my guest.
At least here, we are all safe.
- Yes?
- Yes, boss.
I'll give it a day.
One.
There are inmates...
and there are convicts.
A convict has a certain code.
And he knows to show
a certain respect.
An inmate, on the other hand,
pulls the pin on his fellow man.
Does the guards' work for them.
Brings shame...
to the game.
So, which are you gonna be?
Me?
I'm just passin' through.
Welcome to Crematoria.
Should I go for the sweet spot?
Left of the spine, fourth lumbar down,
the abdominal aorta.
What a gusher.
How do I get eyes like that?
You gotta kill a few people.
Did that.
Did a lot of that.
And then you gotta get sent to a slam. One where
they tell you you'll never see daylight again?
Only there wasn't any doctor here who could
shine my eyes, not even for 20 menthol Kools.
Was there anything
you said that was true?
What are you gonna do, huh?
Go for the sweet spot?
Remember who
you're talkin' to, Jack.
Jack's dead.
She was weak.
She couldn't cut it.
The name's Kyra now.
And I'm a new animal.
They can be quite a test,
these deep runs...
tests of our inner selves.
Don't you find that true?
Some men do.
Just being so far from the armada,
the mind can start to fill
with strange thoughts, doubts.
Don't you ever have doubts, Vaako?
- Doubts?
- About the campaign.
About Lord Marshal.
First and always,
I am a Necromonger commander.
So if you're here to test my loyalty,
you succeed only in testing my patience.
Oh, no.
No, that's not why I'm here at all.
I'm so glad I could
steal you away for a moment.
Doesn't it strike you odd?
Here we have
the current Lord Marshal...
destroying entire societies,
and yet he can't bring himself...
to kill one
stranded Elemental.
Why is that?
You don't pray to our god.
You pray to no god, I hear.
Elementals... we calculate.
Don't we all.
But now let's have first things first.
What of Riddick? In truth,
I don't know where he went.
In truth, I'm more interested
in where he came from.
Watch your step.
I've always wondered,
does an air Elemental fly?
Now do me a favor.
Calculate the odds of you
getting off this planet alive...
and now cut them in half.
No, we can't fly.
But we glide very well.
Save your threats, Necromonger.
I would have told you about Riddick
for the asking.
It concerns a foretelling,
a prediction now more than 30 years old.
A young warrior
once consulted a seer.
He was told a child would be born
on the planet Furya ...a male child...
who would someday
cause the warrior's downfall.
Cause his untimed death.
Furya? Furya's a ruined world.
No life to speak of.
For good reason.
This young warrior
mounted an attack on Furya,
killing all young males
he could find,
even strangling some
with their birth cords.
An artful stroke,
wouldn't you say?
So this warrior, the one who tried to outwit
the prediction, would later become...
That's why he worries.
The Lord Marshal.
Which would make
the man-child...
He worries he missed
killing that child in its crib.
Riddick.
That's why it's so vital to him.
Wait.
- It's about a prophecy.
- Wait! Wait!
Are you there?
You do what your lord asks.
You cleanse Riddick for him,
and in doing so...
you prove your undying loyalty.
And perhaps then
he'll finally let down his guard.
Still here, I see?
I've been here 18 years.
See this?
I remember how gorgeous she was.
Well, gorgeous in a certain light.
And now,
for the goddamn death of me,
I cannot remember her name.
Feeding time!
We're here for the rest
of our unnatural lives.
Here they come!
Whatever you do,
don't make eye contact.
Aaah!
It's an animal thing.
Check her for me.
She's always got a blade somewhere.
Hyah!
I don't think
she likes being touched.
I'd take my wounded and go
while you still can.
Is there a name for this
private little world of yours, huh?
What happens there
when we don't just run away?
You'll kill us... with a soup cup?
Tea, actually.
What's that?
I'll kill you with my teacup.
You know the rule. They aren't dead
if they're still on the books.
Mmm.
Come on.
Death by teacup.
Damn. Why didn't I think of that?
I didn't come to play
"Who's the Better Killer?"
But it's my favorite game.
Haven't you heard?
I heard you came lookin' for me.
Is that all?
Then you missed the good part.
Hooked up with some mercs
outta Lupus Five.
Said they'd take me on,
teach me the trade, give me a good cut.
They slaved me out, Riddick.
Do you know what that could do to you
when you're that age?
When you're 12 years old?
I told you to stay in New Mecca.
Did you not listen?
I had mercs on my neck.
I'll always have mercs on my neck.
I spent five years on a frozen heap
just to keep 'em away from you.
And you go and sign up
with the same fake badges...
that wanted to cut you up
and use you for bait.
What are you pitching, Riddick?
That you cuttin' out was a good thing?
That you had my ass covered
from halfway across the universe?
You signed with mercs.
There was nobody else around.
Let's pop the cork.
Get some fresh air.
So they do go topside...
to swap out air.
Interesting.
Who the hell are you?
When it happens, it'll happen fast.
Stay on my leg when I cut fence
or stay here...
for the rest of your natural life.
Nobody outs this place.
Nobody.
He ain't "nobody."
Good news first.
Talked things over with my amigos here.
We'll cut you in for 775K.
Well, all right.
What's the bad news?
They close the local whorehouse?
No. The bad news is worse than that.
Much worse.
Our pilot, he saw this.
It crossed a shipping lane.
Any idea what this might be?
Never saw nothin' like it.
This ship charts back
to Helion Prime.
You know, Anatoli's
got a nose for trouble,
and he thinks
trouble follows you here.
Look. We dusted our tracks
and got the hell outta there.
There is no way
we didn't lose them.
"Them"?
This is my prisoner. Mine.
Nobody else's.
And I want my money now.
So...
you stole a prisoner...
from "them"?
No.
Riddick. No!
Shoulda taken the money, Toombs.
You gonna kill me?
Mercs.
Some guards here,
but this can't be all of them.
Check their slots in the back...
and be careful.
Don't bother.
Guards ain't there.
They figured out the Necros
are comin' for me.
Plan was to clean the bank,
ghost the mercs,
break wide through the tunnel.
And then somebody got a lucky shot off
with this rocket launcher here...
and took out the sled.
Guards took off on foot but rigged
the door so no one could follow.
They'll take the one ship in the hangar
and leave everyone else here to die.
How come you know all this shit?
You weren't even here.
'Cause it was my plan.
I shoulda taken the money.
Riddick!
What is this?
What is he thinking?
- Once that sun comes up...
- We'll last five minutes.
Five minutes. We ain't gonna last
30 seconds out there.
It'll light you up like a match.
20-mile buffer zone
and 30 klicks to the hangar.
30 klicks over that terrain?
It's moving in the right direction.
We could make it.
Stay behind the night,
ahead of the sun.
There's gonna be one speed...
mine.
If you can't keep up, don't step up.
You'll just die.
Riddick?
Riddick?
Riddick?
Go, go! Go on! Go! Climb here!
Climb! Go! Go, go, go!
Boss!
Up there.
- Take a look.
- Because Anatoli says so?
Because his nose says so.
There's nothin' up here.
Oh, shit.
Riddick.
They're heading right for the volcano
fields. They're going for our ship!
No chance do they get to the hangar first.
No chance!
Next one! Next hole!
We'll catch 'em there!
No more run for you.
Where did the big guy go?
Ohh...
Close it!
What was that?
You don't care if you live or die?
If I kill them first, not really.
Maybe I do.
Keep moving!
Kyra?
- Kyra!
- What?
Get that ass moving!
Riddick?
Remember what I said
about not caring if I lived or died?
You knew I was kidding, right?
"One speed."
Temperature differential.
Your rope.
It's too late.
We're never gonna make it.
Your rope! Gimme your rope!
And your water. All of it!
Stay in the shadow of the mountain.
Don't wait for me. Run!
Riddick!
Aaah!
Where the hell is that hangar?
Here it is.
Listen.
Let me guess. Necros.
And a whole lotta Necro firepower.
Shit! I hate not being the bad guys.
I figure we got three minutes before the sun
hits us again, burns out this whole valley.
- Wait.
- We gonna do this or not?
Just wait.
Ellen.
Her name was Ellen.
I never really forgot.
Aaah! Boss!
- Remember that favorite game of yours?
- "Who's the Better Killer?"
- Let's play.
- Come on!
On the right!
Watch out!
Behind you!
Kyra!
Sybar!
No!
Aaah!
Get up. Get up!
Please get up.
So,
you can kneel.
I think you know now.
I think you know
who tore Furya apart.
This mark carries the anger
of an entire race.
But it's going to hurt.
Kyra?
I was supposed to
deliver a message to you...
if Vaako failed to kill you.
A message from
the Lord Marshal himself.
He tells you to stay away from Helion,
stay away from him,
and in return,
you'll be hunted no more.
But Vaako will most likely
report you as dead.
So this is your chance.
Your chance to do
what no man has ever done.
The girl.
Where will they take her?
We all began... as something else.
I've done... unbelievable things...
in the name of a faith
that was never my own.
And he'll do to her
what he did to me.
The Necromonger in me
warns you not to go back.
But the Furyan in me...
hopes you won't listen.
God knows... I've dreamed of it.
I have lost a Purifier...
but I have gained
a first among commanders.
It is overdue, isn't it...
that we acknowledge
your many accomplishments,
your steady faith,
and above all,
your unflinching loyalty.
Obedience without question.
Loyalty till UnderVerse come.
Well done, Vaako.
This is a day of days.
Look more pleased, Vaako.
You have killed his enemy...
and his suspicions.
- I should have brought back his head.
- You saw him unbreathing. You saw him dead on the ground.
Riddick was no common breeder.
In a heartbeat he dropped 20 of my men.
All mysteries are not miracles,
not even in this religion.
And if you say it is certain,
then it is certain,
and we've already said it,
haven't we?
We have.
Now, tell me if it's true.
Tell me the Furyan is gone, and I can close
this campaign without hearing his bootsteps.
If he is dead,
I sense I'm not far
from the same fate,
being of no further use here.
Shouldn't I tell you
that Riddick is still alive?
Don't try me, Aereon.
I could plow you under
with the rest of Helion Prime.
No one really knows the future.
Then tell me the odds
that Vaako met with success,
that I will now be the one...
who can carry his people across
the threshold into UnderVerse,
where they shall begin true life.
Tell me what I want to hear, Aereon,
and maybe
I'll save your home world... for last.
- The odds are good...
- That?
...that you will reach the UnderVerse...
soon.
Ascension protocol!
We still have numbers out there,
Lord Marshal... sweep teams, recon ships.
They would be hard-pressed
to make it back...
Get my armada off the ground!
- You mean on Helion?
- I mean here, on this very ship!
Could you be wrong?
Mind fabricates fear.
- Could you be wrong?
- Not so wrong as you when you left him alive!
It's twice a mistake.
Not only your failure,
but now the report of success.
How do we salvage this? How? How?
Lord Marshal's got to be warned.
You will never see the UnderVerse!
He will kill us both
before our due time.
I say give Riddick his chance.
If he is half of what you think,
he can at least wound the Lord Marshal...
and that is when you must act.
Just to take his place?
Just to keep what I kill?
- That is the Necromonger way.
- It is not enough!
Then you do it for the faith!
If he has fear, he has weakness.
If he has weakness, Vaako...
He is unworthy of lordship.
We do it for all Necromongers.
Protect the faith.
This can still be a day of days,
but the timing...
must be flawless.
Final protocol.
Execute on my order.
Go inside.
Are they leaving now?
Ziza! Go inside!
We found this Lensor dead.
Show me his last sight.
Commander Toal.
He won't escape twice.
Stay your weapons!
He came for me.
Consider this:
If you fall here now,
you'll never rise.
But if you choose another way...
the Necromonger way...
you'll die in due time...
and rise again in the UnderVerse.
Go to him.
It hurts...
at first.
But after a while, the pain goes away,
just as they promise.
- Are you with me, Kyra?
- There's a moment...
when you can almost
see the UnderVerse through his eyes.
It makes it sound perfect...
a place where anyone
can start over.
Are you with me, Kyra?
Convert now...
or fall forever.
You killed everything I know.
Vaako.
Not yet.
Been a long time
since I've seen my own blood.
These are his last moments.
Give me your soul.
Fuck you!
You're not the one to bring me down.
Now! Kill the beast
while he's wounded!
Help me, Vaako. Kill him.
Vaako?
Forgive me.
Flawless.
No.
No-o-o!
Now what would be the odds of that?
I thought you were dead.
Are you with me, Kyra?
I was always with you.
I was.
You keep what you kill.
