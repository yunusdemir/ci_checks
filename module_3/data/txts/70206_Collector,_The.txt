<i>In light of the Kaylon attack,</i>
<i>the Moclans have proposed
a new round of weapons upgrades</i>
<i>for all explorer-class vessels
and above.</i>
I would say that's a good idea.
<i>The refit should only take a day or so.</i>
<i>We've also received a special request</i>
<i>from the Moclan Science Division.</i>
<i>You'll be picking up an
engineer and transporting him</i>
<i>to a research vessel
in the Nekkar System.</i>
Sir, with all due respect,
we're starting to feel
- like a taxi cab here.
<i>- I know.</i>
<i>But it's the least we can do
in exchange for bigger guns.</i>
- All right.
<i>- Have fun.</i>
<i>Halsey out.</i>
I'll go start the meter.
30% power upgrade
to the plasma cannons,
20% increase in torpedo capacity.
Guys, this is great.
Tell your team well done.
Unless you require further
assistance, we will depart.
All good. You've more
than exceeded our expectations.
I will escort you to the shuttle bay.
<i>Keyali to Captain.</i>
Mercer here. Go ahead.
Engineer Toren's transport is
requesting permission to dock.
<i>Permission granted.</i>
Great. I'll show him to his quarters.
You sure you don't want me
to take your bag?
- Looks like it's heavy.
- No, I am fine.
So, how long have you two
been together?
Korick and I have been mates
for nine years.
That's amazing.
I always love hearing that.
Gives us single people hope.
I understand that vessels such as this
are very... attentive
toward their guests.
However, Toren and I
would prefer to be left alone
- during our voyage.
- No problem.
Well, these are your quarters.
If you'd like, I can show you around.
That will not be necessary.
Okay, then. Just give me
a holler if you need anything.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
This was a mistake.
If we are discovered...
We will not be.
The difficult part is complete.
We have evaded their scans, and
they do not appear suspicious.
Nonetheless, we must remain vigilant.
You see?
All is well.
We have nothing to fear.
Hey, I need that for my house.
- It's mine. Get your own.
- Topa, give it back.
We're supposed to share.
- I don't share with females.
- Why not?
My papa says females are weak.
Well, your papa's stupid.
Now give it back.
Hey.
Topa, no. We do not shove people.
- Olivia, you okay?
- Yeah.
This isn't the first time
that Topa's been disrespectful
to a female student.
But he crossed a line today.
Was he provoked in some way?
I don't think so,
but even if that were the case,
it's unacceptable behavior.
Perhaps you should consider separating
the male and female children.
None of the other boys
have trouble getting along
with the girls.
We apologize for
our son's disruptive behavior.
We will speak with him.
Thank you.
Is it true that you had an altercation
with a fellow classmate?
- Yes.
- Why?
She had a piece I needed.
Your teacher says you took it from her.
- And that you pushed her.
- Yeah, so?
That was wrong, Topa.
But she's a female.
That makes no difference.
They're inferior.
It doesn't matter what they think.
- Where did you hear such things?
- From Papa.
Go to your room, Topa.
We will discuss your punishment later.
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Go.
You do not make things easy.
I am simply teaching our son
the traditional values
on which we ourselves were raised.
Klyden, has your time on this ship
not changed your perspective
in any way?
It has obviously changed yours.
What harm can come from allowing him
to discover his own path?
Topa may decide he wants
to live on Moclus one day.
In that event, we must tell him
the truth of his origins.
- What happened to you must...
- What happened to me
did not shatter my faith in our ways.
Perhaps when Topa is grown,
Moclus will not be so... intolerant.
Who are you to question
our core beliefs?
You are only one Moclan.
What makes the rest
of our society wrong
and your perverse vision right?
If it were up to you,
our son would still be female.
I am sorry.
It is not my wish to hurt you.
<i>- Bridge to Commander Bortus.</i>
- Yes.
Isaac has been tracking
a power fluctuation on deck C.
We think our Moclan visitors
may be tapping into the grid.
For what reason?
That's what we want you to go find out.
If they need extra power
for some reason,
that's fine,
but they need to ask first.
<i>They can't just plug stuff in.</i>
I am on my way, Commander.
Yes?
There is an unauthorized power drain
originating in these quarters.
The food synthesizer was set
to a reduced precision.
My dinner was not flavorful enough,
so I increased
the molecular resolution.
I was not aware
that I needed permission.
Please stand aside.
You are siphoning power
beyond regulation levels.
Please disconnect the device.
It is... sensitive research.
I would prefer to wait until
we rendezvous with our vessel.
What are you carrying
that would require such power?
You will open it.
Why are you hiding this infant?
She is our daughter.
We are fleeing Moclus.
We do not want her to undergo
the corrective procedure
or to live in hiding as an outcast.
Where do you intend to go?
Retepsia.
Their government has granted us asylum.
The captain of the research vessel
has agreed to take us there.
I beg you not to report this.
Our child will be taken from us.
We love her just as she is.
You are asking me to lie to my captain.
Commander, I know of your trial.
I know you understand
what is happening here.
The transport ship
is only a few hours away.
All we ask is that you stay silent
until we leave.
No one must know.
Bortus to Commander Grayson.
<i>- Go ahead.</i>
- Our Moclan visitors
required power for a stasis chamber
which contains perishable supplies.
I will provide them with
an alternate power source.
<i>Acknowledged. Thanks, Bortus.</i>
We will not forget your kindness.
Bortus. What can I do for you?
I wanted to see how Topa was doing.
Well, no new incidents so far.
Hopefully, whatever you said
to him has sunk in.
I'm optimistic.
I wish to remove him
from class early today.
Sure. Any particular reason?
A family matter.
This will provide
the power you require.
Thank you. Who is this?
My son, Topa.
May we come in?
It is all right, Korick.
He has promised not to speak
of what he sees here today.
Isn't that right, Topa?
Yes, Papa.
It is a female.
Her name is Mersa.
But there are no Moclan females.
Only a few are born every generation.
Some people fear them.
That is why her parents
have chosen to conceal her.
Look at her, Topa.
She is not so different from you or I.
Your hospitality
is greatly appreciated.
It's our pleasure. Good luck
with your new assignment.
Good-bye, Commander.
Safe journey.
<i>Mercer to Bortus.</i>
Yes, Captain?
<i>Please report to my office.</i>
It's been brought to my
attention that we may have had
an unauthorized passenger on board.
Yes.
That'll be all, Klyden.
I'm sorry, Papa. I didn't mean to tell.
It is all right, Topa.
We will discuss it later.
Would you care to explain?
The infant was in stasis,
and they did not want it known.
Because she was a girl.
Why did you hide it from us?
I did not know how you would respond,
and I did not want to jeopardize
the infant's future.
Her parents are taking her to Retepsia,
where they will be free
to raise her as a female.
I regret deceiving you, Captain.
How do you know they were
telling the truth?
If you had called me,
I could have run a DNA scan
to see if they were really the parents.
I had no reason to doubt them.
I'd say there's plenty of reasons.
For one, they boarded a Union ship
under false pretenses.
For all we know,
they kidnapped that baby.
I do not believe so.
Well, that's really nice
for you, but you've put
all of our asses on the line
if you're wrong.
That was not my intention.
Well, we transported that baby,
so we need to be sure.
Find that ship and plot
an intercept course.
What do you intend to do
if we find them?
Well, let's verify their story
first, and then go from there.
Dismissed.
It doesn't make sense.
That ship was built
for research, not espionage.
How can there be no trace?
Isaac, do you have any way to
scan for masked ion signatures?
I believe so.
Okay, this one time at Union Point,
my roommate and I took a shuttle out,
and we turned it into,
like, a party bus,
and we used a tractor beam
to neutralize our ion trail.
They didn't catch you?
Well, we plowed into a tree
when we landed, and that's when
they caught us, but...
before that,
we were completely invisible.
I believe I have found it.
That's it.
Look at that.
Th-They're not even remotely
on a course for Retepsia.
The ion trail intersects with
a class-six absorption nebula
approximately 12 light-years away.
Gordon, set a pursuit course,
- maximum speed.
- Aye, sir.
What kind of research vessel
masks their ion trail?
I don't think their mission has
anything to do with research.
My God,
that thing's got to be over a trillion
kilometers across.
- Isaac?
- The trail leads directly inside.
However, scans are unable
to penetrate the interior.
Take us in.
There. You see that?
Just off the starboard bow.
It appears to be a K-type star.
There are three planets in orbit.
It's a star system.
Bortus, any sign of the ship?
Negative. However, the innermost
planet reads as habitable.
Take us into a high orbit.
The planet's surface is over 80% ocean,
but there are several dozen
island chains.
I have located the Moclan vessel
on an island near the equator.
I'm picking up bio-signs.
Thousands of them.
Sir?
They're Moclan.
My God.
They're women.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Keep moving.
Inside.
Osaia, you can put away your weapon.
I know these people.
Heveena.
You have an extraordinary talent
for tracking me down, Captain Mercer.
The females we saw, how many are there?
Commander Bortus,
what I am about to say
will come as a shock to you.
There are many more females
born on Moclus
than the government
has ever publicly admitted.
Almost all undergo
the corrective procedure.
But some oppose it, and those that do
risk everything to escape Moclus
and make their way to this sanctuary.
In our colony, there are over 6,000.
Many years ago, we established
a clandestine network of ships
to help families who sought refuge.
I have made the journey
over a dozen times myself.
Does Moclus have any idea
about this place?
They suspect it exists,
but we have managed to evade detection.
Until now.
Heveena, we must keep them here.
They must not be allowed
to reveal our location.
We followed the transport alone.
There are no other ships here.
But there are over 300 people
aboard your vessel.
That is over 300 ways to expose us.
She is correct.
This colony cannot remain hidden.
But if they found you...
They would destroy this
settlement and everyone in it.
We must relocate.
I will contact the transport circuit.
We can begin
the evacuation immediately.
Wait.
Let me suggest an alternative.
Let us go to Union Central
and submit an application
for recognition
as an independent state.
If the Union Council agrees,
you will be under its protection
and you won't have to hide anymore.
And if they reject your request?
It was always inevitable
that fate would beckon us
from the shadows.
"Every revolution"
"begins with a single act of defiance."
One of yours?
Actually, I don't know who said it.
Captain, I would like to accompany you
to stand before this council.
That's exactly what I was going to ask.
<i>Your request for a hearing
has been approved</i>
<i>by the Union Council.</i>
<i>As you might expect,</i>
<i>the Moclan delegation is up in arms.</i>
<i>They're demanding to know
the colony's location</i>
<i>so they can extradite
and prosecute the fugitives.</i>
- Fugitives?
<i>- Their word, not mine.</i>
<i>You'll take a shuttle
to rendezvous with</i>
<i>the USS</i> Burnell,<i> which will</i>
<i>take you back to Earth.</i>
<i>The Orville will remain in
orbit to protect the colony.</i>
Acknowledged.
Man, I hope I'm up to this.
I can't think of anyone
they could trust more.
Do a good job, and I'll have
a bourbon waiting for you.
You got a deal.
I know nothing of your... Earth.
Is it like Moclus?
A little, I guess.
The females on Earth... do they write?
They do.
To be free to create.
To make art.
Well, you know, you can access
Earth's cultural database from here.
You'll find centuries
of art of all kinds
from the women of Earth.
Who is she?
That's, uh, Dolly Parton.
Oh.
She speaks with the might
of a hundred soldiers.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess she does.
This is the voice of our revolution.
Well, you know, there's actually
a whole bunch of stuff...
No!
It is she.
Okay, then.
Go, Dolly.
I wish to thank everyone for
convening at such short notice.
We consider this to be
a matter of great importance.
A recently discovered colony of Moclans
is petitioning this body
to be recognized
as a sovereign state,
entitled to all
of the rights and protections
afforded any member
of the Planetary Union.
Here on behalf of the colonists
is their chosen representative.
Heveena, please,
make your statement.
This is a flagrant insult
to every Moclan in this chamber!
You will not allow
- this female to speak.
- The council has already
voted on the matter.
You'll get your turn to talk, Dojin.
For now, sit down and listen.
Thank you, Chairman.
And thank you
to the esteemed members
of this council.
It is with hope and pride
that I stand here today
as a voice for those who
have been voiceless for so long.
It is true that we have been
living in exile,
outside of the laws
of our native planet,
but to do otherwise
would invite persecution, mutilation
and even extinction.
If our plea to be recognized
as an independent state fails,
I fear that our voices
will be silenced forever.
As I look upon all
of the exquisite diversity
in this great hall,
I am reminded
that most of us share
something in common.
Over the course of history,
there have been people
on nearly every planet who were,
at one time or another, oppressed...
by those who were stronger...
or greater in numbers...
for reasons that now seem
insignificant to us.
The history of moral progress
can be measured by the expansion
of fundamental rights
to those who have been denied them.
We ask only to be included
in that expanding circle of justice.
There is a visionary Earth poet
who I have recently come to cherish.
- Oh, boy.
- What?
With power and dignity,
she boldly cried out
so that all the cosmos
would know of her suffering.
"Working 9 to 5"
"For service and devotion,"
"You would think that I"
"Would deserve a fat promotion,"
"Want to move ahead,"
"But the boss won't seem to let me,"
"I swear sometimes that
man is out to get me."
In the spirit of her courage,
please...
hear our voices.
Thank you.
The floor is now open to discuss
the petition for sovereignty.
Discussion is irrelevant!
Know this, Chairman.
If the council grants independence
to this colony of outlaws,
Moclus will renounce
its Union membership.
Commander, long-range scans
are picking up
something in the nebula.
- It is a Moclan vessel.
- What?
Oh, man, we really stepped in it today.
Lieutenant, open a channel.
Channel open.
This is Commander Kelly Grayson
of the USS<i> Orville.</i>
Please identify yourselves.
<i>Good day, Commander.</i>
<i>I am Captain Jakohn.</i>
May I ask what you're doing here?
<i>We are here
for the same reason as you...</i>
<i>to monitor the colony</i>
<i>while the council decides its fate.</i>
Really? Then why send a battle cruiser?
<i>If it so happens that the colony</i>
<i>is not granted Union protection,</i>
<i>we wish to ensure that justice
is served without delay...</i>
<i>and without interference.</i>
Well, until the council
reaches a decision,
there's nothing for either of us
to do but wait here quietly.
<i>Indeed.</i>
<i>I am sure we will speak again soon.</i>
Bortus.
Take us to yellow alert.
Aye, sir.
This so-called "colony" is nothing more
than an elaborate
child-trafficking operation.
What this female
and her accomplices are doing
is not just illegal and immoral.
They are placing
their own radical agenda
above the security of the Union itself!
Today is not the day
to fracture alliances.
Today, it is more important than ever
that our worlds stand together
against the Kaylon threat!
And I do not need to remind the council
that this Union's
primary supplier of weapons
is Moclus.
Why is this debate still going on?
This is about basic rights.
The council needs
to grant their request.
Look, Ed, I don't like it
any more than you do,
but the Moclans are free
to defend their position.
And we must be mindful
of our own prejudices as well.
We cannot judge other cultures
purely by human standards.
I agree. And-and I am the first
person to question the balance
between cultural tolerance
and ethical negligence.
But, Admiral, this is over the limit.
Let's stick to the issue.
In the Moclans' view,
the children living
on that colony are victims.
And from their
cultural standpoint, it's true,
they had no say in their parents'
decision to leave Moclus.
Look, why don't we
just call this like it is.
The Union turns a blind eye
to Moclan custom
because we need their weapons.
You're out of line, Captain.
And you're oversimplifying
a very complicated situation.
We can't afford to alienate
the Moclans right now.
Without their weapons supply,
how soon do you think the Kaylon
would wipe us all out?
Look, I've been telling
the council for years
that it's crazy to rely
so heavily on one planet
for weapons manufacture.
Don't politicize this, Captain.
The time for that debate
is after this crisis.
There are no clean options.
If we turn our backs on the colony,
all those women will be rounded up
and probably forced
into corrective surgery.
But if we lose the Moclans,
the Kaylon come after us.
We're talking about mass genocide.
Yeah, but don't you think
the Moclans know that, too?
They're just as vulnerable
as we are without this alliance.
They would have to stay with us.
We don't know that
they'd see it that way.
Look, I understand what's at stake.
I'm just saying
that if we are not willing
to stand up for the values that
this Union was founded on...
what exactly are we defending?
Hey.
I just heard from Ed.
The council broke for the evening,
and deliberations are underway.
Thank you, Commander.
What will you do...
if Moclus leaves the Union?
I do not know.
Bortus.
I have been looking for you.
Come home. It is late.
I will be home soon.
We have much to discuss.
There is nothing more to say
until the council reaches its decision.
We cannot ignore the possibility
that we will be going back to Moclus.
I imagine that would please you.
What do you mean?
You have never been comfortable
aboard this ship.
There are females here,
and it sickens you.
It does not.
You did not bother to
greet Commander Grayson.
And you have not acknowledged
her presence
since you have been standing here.
Listen, guys, I'd rather not get
in the middle of...
No.
Please, stay.
You rarely leave our quarters
or socialize with the crew.
You cling to traditions
that serve no useful purpose.
Your mind remains closed,
and you wish to raise our child
to embrace this ignorance.
<i>Bridge to Commander Grayson.</i>
<i>Four Moclan shuttles
are heading for the surface.</i>
Report.
No response from the shuttles,
and the Moclan ship
just raised its deflectors.
- Hail them.
- Channel open.
Captain Jakohn.
You mind telling me
what the hell you're doing?
<i>We were given orders
to apprehend the colonists.</i>
<i>They are to be returned to Moclus,</i>
<i>where they will answer
for their crimes.</i>
<i>Do not interfere.</i>
Get me Union Central.
This is absolutely unacceptable.
Order your ship
to stand down immediately.
The colony and its inhabitants
fall under our jurisdiction.
You would go to war over this?
They've been smuggling infants
off our planet for decades.
Perhaps you do not protect
your children as we do.
Ambassador, let's not
let this get out of hand.
We can and will find
a diplomatic solution.
Then present one
that is acceptable to us!
We've got to confer with the council.
Sir, Kelly's out there.
I can't just tell her
to sit back and do nothing.
You tell her to hold tight.
The<i> Orville</i> will take
no provocative action
that could escalate the situation.
- But, sir...
- That being said,
communications can be spotty
inside a nebula.
Your message may not get through.
What are you talking about?
Of course it'll get through.
We just got a new communications
array as a part... Oh, right.
Yes. Sorry. It's been a long day.
Commander, we're receiving
a transmission from Earth.
It's the captain.
Finally. Put him on.
Ed, we've been trying to reach you.
Things have all gone to hell out here.
<i>I know. What's your status?</i>
I have a shuttle prepped and ready.
You got to get me clearance
to go down there
and protect that colony.
<i>Official orders
are to hold your position.</i>
What?
<i>Unofficial orders are...</i>
<i>go work on your tan.</i>
Bortus, you have the conn.
Commander, you are not
going down there alone.
This could be a career-ender.
I can't ask anyone else to risk it.
Take the conn. That's an order.
I must disobey that order.
Bortus, those are Moclans.
You may have to fire
on your own people.
Commander, we are wasting time.
Talla, you have the bridge.
They have locked onto us
with a tractor beam.
Full power to the deflectors.
- No effect.
- Son of a bitch.
Go to red alert.
Isaac, target their emitters.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.
If you fire on that ship,
- that's an act of war.
- It sure is.
The Moclans are members of the Union.
You can't make that call on
your own. Get Kelly on the comm.
Kelly's never gonna give that order.
If she can end her career, so can I.
- Isaac?
- Emitters targeted.
Fire.
I'll give you one warning.
Lower your weapons
and walk away from those people.
Do it now.
Do not interfere, human.
This does not concern you.
Typical guy... never listens.
Starboard shields are failing.
Hull damage on decks D and E.
I got an idea.
If I can take us out of orbit
and back into the nebula,
the natural E.M. interference
will confuse their targeting scanners.
Do it. Go.
This problem is an internal matter
for the Moclans to handle themselves.
The Union Council
is not a policing body.
I must reluctantly agree.
If the Union imposes its will
on Moclus,
it sets a dangerous precedent.
- Who will be next?
- If you continue
to let them oppress their own people,
what kind of precedent does that set?
We will renounce the Union
before we allow it
to force-feed us
its own code of ethics.
Ambassador, if you secede,
you'll be opening the door
for the Kaylon to destroy us all.
Unless the Krill
allied themselves with us
instead of the Union.
It is likely they would
follow the weapons.
Admiral, if I may.
Ambassador, the Moclans and the Krill
can't stop the Kaylon alone,
and you know it.
Moclus would be destroyed.
But that little planet
inside the nebula
might just be insignificant
enough to fly under the radar,
and if that happens,
the only Moclans left in the galaxy
would be female.
But, hey, you'd still be
a single-sex species.
With the chairperson's permission,
I would like to propose
a provisional compromise.
Proceed, Admiral Halsey.
These are the terms I suggest:
The Union agrees
not to recognize the sovereignty
of the colony at this time,
and the colonists agree
to end their clandestine
emigration network,
effective immediately.
In exchange, the Moclan government
shall agree
to leave the colonists in peace
and take no further action against them
now or in the future.
An agreement has been reached.
Stand down.
You okay?
Yes, Commander.
It is all right.
You are safe now.
Heveena, I am so sorry
- for everything that's happened.
- It is true.
We did not succeed,
not in the way we had hoped.
But then, we did not fail.
You're remarkably optimistic.
The women of this colony
could be back on Moclus,
undergoing forced corrective surgery,
and very likely spending the
rest of their lives in prison.
But they are here,
safe in the knowledge that their lives,
their identities and their destinies
are their own.
What of your underground?
It is gone, that is so.
But just as we took
that bold first step,
in time, others like us
will take a second one.
The revolution has begun.
We will rise,
one small victory at a time.
I believe you will.
Captain.
Do you suppose
Dolly Parton would be proud of us?
Oh, yeah.
