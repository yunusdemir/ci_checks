It's sausage roll
For God's sake, how do I know it?
But I can tell you...
Besides stomach dumpling

For the material used is no.1
And the meat used has been managed
in a very technical way

Fok's Martial Art School?
If so, you should come to our school
Right, that's the actual rule
Damn you, which side do you belong to?
Of course the one with more people
Stand at the back then
Dr. Chiu, I think you don't just
want to look at my power
You want to kill me
For money?
Not yet, but after your death
Then I will become a professionaI killer
I won't do such things
Hello Dr. Fok, nice to meet you...
Let's shake hands
Call me when you are free
Ching, no tissue paper?
Just dip it down there and go
You refuse killing, right?
Then I'll kill you
That means you are oppressing me
You are full of confidence, right?
Then I can't help you
Start
Well done
Master Chiu
we people practice martial art
Should not kill other for money
Let's stop here
We still can be friends in the future
Master Fok What?
As a return
You should let him go
Damn you
You'd listen to what I told you, right?
I think this is not the proper way
What? Will you go now?
You don't want to?
Really I think...
Then go to hell
Kill him
Dad, are you OK?
Dad? Cover it first
Find some place to hide
Have you found any place to hide?
Get down there
It's you?
Watch out
Run for life Chase no more
Ching, don't die, my fate depends on you
Papa, how are you?
Alright
to have some medicine will be ok
Why are you still so stink?
Have you cleaned up?
Dr. Fok, I will call you when I am free
Son of a bitch
Don't... I will call you too
He saved me, bring him back
Are you alright?
Still rather painful
Dr. Fok, it's you?
This is my home
Where are you living?
I just come from Canton
to look for a relative here
But I have lost his contact
Now I am homeless
Then who's that tall guy
with black hat and leather jacket?
He is the one I met when I've arrived HK
Is he here? He took you here
I don't care what's your future planning
If you don't mind
you can rest here for few days
Good
Alright, then go to bed earlier
Thanks
One piece of paper, one fountain pen
They are useful for a coward man
Hope that through this letter
You can feel that I love you much
I have many to tell you
but I don't know where to start
Let's keep our love deep in our heart
From one waiter of one restaurant
see you tomorrow
It's dramatic
Only one letter is not enough
Flower to add the romance
Don't pick up wild flowers
It's my handkerchief Robber
Who?
It's him?
What are you doing here?
I've been seen picking up the flowers
Oh, it's not me
Robber See my fist
Got it
How can you attack my eyes?
If I see you stealing flowers
in my house again
I will break your arm
You are non-human
how can you attack my eyes?
Don't be nervous, keep calm
I will not let her know that I'm nervous
But why you smoke so much?
I am not nervous
But a bit crazy
Let me analyse it
If she falls for me, she will come
So I should be smart then
Sure, my name is Smart
Brother Smart
What're you doing here? Nothing
Where is Ching?
It'll be embarrassed for him
Have you read the letter?
What do you think?
Happy
I am really happy
Yeah, me too
Really? Yes
You are such a nice man
That you feel happy for me
I'm always a nice man
But I don't know how to express myself
Letter Great
I've written one
It's funny
I know what you think actually
Sometimes, you needn't express yourself
Thanks you
Give Ching this letter pIease
Ching?
You're the right person
to represent him here
You always give me a warm feeling
Just like my brother
Really?
The way you hold me last time
Like being hold by my family member
Warm and close
Safe and pure
I believe
you've the same feeling as I do
Maybe
Why you cry?
I am touched
You treat me as brother
I can hardly believe it
How can I have a sister in such a way
Brother Sister
Let kiss you, sister
Brother Smart Kiss...
What're you doing?
I am out of control suddenly
Remember to give Ching this letter
See you
Don't worry, I'll do it
I'll give this letter to him
Never
Why should I help that bastard
to hook my girl?
What's this?
Why do I become her brother?
I want to hook her only
I hate being brother
God damn brother
Master Fok
Are you alright?
Then you can return home tomorrow
Frankly speaking
I want to learn Kung-fu from you
But I think you're not gifted
Maybe you can find other job
But...
My hand is powerful
I don't know how to make best use of it
You want me to teach you?
How many years have you learnt Kung-fu?
I don't mean this one
I mean my right one
which is too powerful
OK, show me your power
I seldom beat of others
I scare that...
You think you can hurt me?
I, Fok Wan
as being a Kung-fu master for many years
No one can ever hurt me
You are too green
in the world of Kung-fu
Come on
Yes, master Fok is so powerful that
Sure you can stand my fist
Come on, beat it now
Yes, sir
How do you feel?
Have a rest
How great
I am scared but I can't tell the others
Make up in first
Master Fok
You can rest now
What do you think my fist?
Quite powerful, but not very powerful
I know it
I know. For I use only 20% force
20% ?
But I use 20% force
to resist your fist too
Why don't you use full strength?
I am afraid of hurting you
Kidding
You just looked me down
I have been a famous
Kung-fu master for years
No one can ever hurt me
Why don't you hit me in full strength?
But you can go now
Maybe we can try again
What?
I will try my very best this time
Very best?
Don't you want it? Sure
OK, let's start
Come on, I scare nothing
Dad
Hey, Nandy, you come the right time
I love you so much
Dad, outside...
Are you Iooking for me?
Some guests have come for you
OK, I'll go and see
Why didn't you wait me in the garden?
Garden?
We come to visit Master Fok
This way out
Master Fok
They are the Kung-fu masters in Japan
They come here
for studying Chinese Kung-fu
We have so many branches of Kung-fu
Why they choose us?
The Fok's fist is
originated from Master Chan Chun
So the Japanese are very interested
But I am not interested in Japanese
You'd better go now
Well, give it to him
My Japanese friends said
We wouldn't force you in fighting
But take this for memory
Shut up
if you think the statement is wrong
You can prove it
I think it's not necessary
Shit
Damn you old fool, you are useless
You make Chinese feel ashamed
Who has guts to come out?
You really have guts
Who kicked me out?
Don't pretend to be hero
if you have no guts
So don't blame to be kicked out
You shameless, you lose our face
Little friend
it's none of your business
Wrong
It's not only your business
but our business
For we Chinese being insulted
We are Chinese
We should help each others
We should be like brothers and sisters
This is the merit of Chinese
We are no sick men
Did I act good?
Where is the camera?
What camera?
I think you are filming
Stupid, they are enemies
What?
Kid, your lines sound nice
But it's not useful as fist
I am different
I can prove you are sick man
Watch me
This is the great Kung-fu of Japan
Gain some face for the Chinese
It's the fact that
I thought you were filming right now
You know, you dress so odd
No matter what had happened before
You can settle it peacefully
I'd better return to my own place
Listen to your master
What's the matter?
Great, he can't get up
What a sick man
My turn
Useless
Let's go Stand right there
The play has not yet been end
Yes...
Come back... Yes...
Still remember how to play your role?
Yes, eat the paper...
So, I am going to eat this
You dare to cheat me?
No, but it's hard to chew
This time, I want you to eat paper
Next time
I want you to eat the frame too
Go if you are busy Yes
Great...
You are really great
I must beat you later
I hate the satyr most
You are my students
so you should obey my rules here
Hurry up
Come to greet the master
Is it necessary? Hurry up
Tea please
Greet now
Thank you master Thanks
I'll instruct you in these two days
for Master is out
I'll teach you Fok's Fist
From the beginning
you should learn how to be beat
No counter attack
Great
Stop
Stop
My demonstration now
You, fight with me
Is it painful? I feel comfortable
Great
What is the matter?
Don't
You are too much
How come you attack my eyes again
Don't bother, take care of me
Stop acting, you are OK
I feel so painful
He is seriousIy hurt, what'll we do?
Well, I'll be responsible
I'll take care of him
I have Nandy, that's OK
He will take good care of you
Don't worry
What else do you want?
I want pissing
I want to go to toiIet
I can't find the toilet
Take me there
I don't understand
why Wai always goes against me
I don't know
when I'd be free from his torture
Come over here...
I have thought a way
to solve his eye attack
Come on, attack my eyes
No, how about hurting you?
No way, come on, try it
I won't play this
Well, I won't tell the story of Nandy
What story?
Come on, try attacking my eyes
Come on
You say so Come on
Watch carefully
What are you doing?
You can't attack in this way
What a troublesome man, ready?
Come on
Damn you, why you use your toes?
Why not? It's you who told me
attacked in some other way
So I use my toes instead of my hand
Or should I use my ass?
I don't want to play with you
You know I have no guts
Give it to Nandy for me
You are my buddy, right?
Let me have some idea first
Nandy
All shit here, how can he hook girl?
How nice am I, I'll finish for him
Sister
I am going to be a nice man tonight
Good luck
Anything worth being stolen?
Tooth picks
Forget it, I won't steal sister's stuff
Except this
A handkerchief for memory
Watch for me
Damn it
Be smart Yes sir
This is for me?
The night my dad was attacked
I was glad to meet you again
Although we live in the same house
I feel that I am too far from you
So I write to express myself
I wish a date with you

Don't beat me
Ah Keung? Ah Ching?
Yes, I come here to meet you, but...
I lost your address, so I can't find you
What are you doing here?
Me? Stealing

Dad You bastard
Me?
Listen to me
Wai wants to rape Nandy, not me
You can ask my friend
He saw it too
His words are true
I heard everything behind the dresser
What were you doing behind the dresser?
I...
I can prove what Ching said is true
I swear
Master, it's yours
It's a misunderstanding
I'll let you go this time
for you have saved me
We don't have any relation from now on
Don't come to my home anymore go now
Don't be so upset
There are many Kung-fu masters
else where
We will have 10 million
if we get the championship
Then many women will come to yours then
And you, Keung, you needn't to be thief
Damn you
I'll bump you with a Benz later
Let's rob the Hong Kong Bank, OK?
How can you think out such poor idea?
We shouldn't cart from such illegal ways
Are you preaching?
Yeah, why I say in such a way?
I am being touched
Ching, I've changed
I am a man filled with righteous
Damn you, you put your blame on me?
Shut up, you are not qualified to speak
What's these?
How do I know?
Why Nandy's letter is with you?
Why my letter to Nandy is torn?
You are my friend
and you dare to cheat me?
I don't want to see you anymore
Keung, let's go
Let's go to my 4 brothers
and learn Kung-fu from them
They are really great
What are you talking?
He is my buddy, big brother
Come in, we are having important meeting
Come in Big brother
Who is he?
He is my buddy in Canton, named Ching
So we are of the same famiIy
Let's continue
my plan is to rob HK Bank
Ching, we are going to be rich
We have checked the surrounding area
You two watch over the entrance
One be the driver, one be the informer
Keung and I will cope with the guards
Bill is going to take the manager
as hostage Good idea
Who will take the money?
Who will take the money?
It seems that we are lack of labour
It affects our plan
Don't
May be we can find
a smaller bank as target
Let me think about it May be Heng Seng
It's a big
The Happy Valley branch is rather small
only one guard's there
We can cope with that
We can rob comfortable too
Good idea
Yes, good idea
Any guns?
The gun of the guard is rather powerful
Gun? No, but you have guts
I think you can fight
with him in bear hand
Why don't you fight with him yourself?
Never
Shall we ban this too?
Don't be miserable
May be we can find
another less risky one
Which one?
The store in next street maybe
No, they always lend us stuffs
They are nice to us You are right
So what shall we do?
Since then
Let's learn from the African elephants
Hide and die quietly
It's no need to rob to get famous
Why don't you walk in nude?
You'll surely be famous Yeah
Bullshit
We old men will easily catch cold
Kid, you are too cocky
Don't get mad, I have an idea
Tell us then
Ching is great in fighting
His right hand is really powerful
Only you take him as student
Bring him to play the boxing match
We'll be famous
if he gets the championship
10 million as well
It sounds good
I think you're too optimistic
Are you looking down upon us?
I don't mean it
I think you are young
you've bright future
I am too oId, I will waste your time
You cocky guy, beat him
Watch out
My feet
Watch mine
Would anybody get killed?
Don't you refuse to be our students
But I want you to be my student instead
Greet your master Come on
Master...
Kung-fu comes after guts and strength
I want to train your guts now

Congratulation, you are the 1st man
To rob virtue in HK
Don't be greedy
You have guts but no Kung-fu
Our principal is rather practical
I gain these in my killing experience
We don't have guard book
you'd learn by understanding
Remember, be force
attack the most important part
Your stick
Are you alright? Sure
Your heart
Your neck
You are killing, not fighting
You are killing, not fighting
Kill him
He is dying
Are you dead?
Call the ambulance
Ching, in the competition
You should hide yourself
Don't let anybody know
the power of your right hand
So you'd let yourself to be
an ordinary man during training
Improve yourself in every field
Bastard
More force
We will anytime
Train your reaction violently
They deserve it
Beat them to get
more fighting experience
How? Armed
Should I deserve beating

Hi, Smart Hello, Brother Kuen
You look different!
I've heard that you're getting rich
Don't fool me
How humble are you?
The youngster you brought to Ping
He is participating
the final competition
Be frank
He is well trained by me
He can make it
If he gets the champion
you will have 50%, right?
You can get 5 million
Are you kidding? When he arrived HK
Who designed a new look for him I did it
Who trained him? It's me
Who brought him to the hooker?
I did everything for him
50-50? We share it in 20 to 80
I have 80%
Brother Kuen
there is a troublesome man coming for me
Please pretend to be CID
And drive him away, just help me
Hello Brother Choi, how are you?
Brother Choi
I'm looking for you to pay you back
Really? Your buddy will give you
much money, won't he?
Sure, but after he wins the championship
I will pay in double, OK?
Let me introduce you
my best friend first
Brother Kuen
He comes from HK police force
The captain of the 9th Special Unit
Mr. Chang Kuen
Hello
when have you started to be a police?
I wonder you two
have known each other already
Brother-in-law
You are his wife's brother?
Then hooker Ping is his sister
What are you talking?
I haven't been her customers
She is ugly indeed
What?
It is my fault
I should be her customer
May be next time
next time, OK?
What?
Actually, a hooker sister is not bad
Hookers are all
independent professional women
But loan sharks are always the best
Hooker isn't much income
Your income is
much better than the hooker
Loan Shark is
much more better than any hooker
How dare you speak like this?
Hooker is a nice job
For men need them
So, it's common and correct
to go for hooker
It's wise for your wife to be a hooker
To be a hooker in life
They serve all men
Maybe we'd add
a Noble Prize for the hooker
Beat him
In today's competition
