What?
Fuck you, douchebag.
Yo, respect!
Modesto, have you got a second?
MODESTO SUCKS!
We're making progress, Modesto.
Every school in the area
has fired me.
But you don't see
dead people any more.
We still need to pinpoint
the problem.
Dead people are buried
in the ground, right? In holes.
It's time to accept their existence.
- Dead people?
- No.
The hole.
It's the hole that scares you.
And the hole, my dear Modesto
is your anus.
How can I put this...
you are gay.
I'm not gay.
Sure you are.
Repeat after me:
"I'm gay and there's no such thing
as ghosts."
I put this kid through college
for nothing.
No, wait!
Shit!
Ghosts appear
in Shakespeare's work
to remind the hero
that he has yet to complete
his mission in life.
Open your books to Hamlet,
Act I,
Scene XI.
Elsa, can you read it, please?
"I am your father's spirit,"
"doomed for a certain time
to walk the night..."
An awful translation.
In English we can appreciate
how wonderful it sounds.
"I am your father's spirit,"
"doomed for a certain time"
"to walk the night."
"And the day"
"And the day, the day...
"I am on fire."
No, it was not so.
Here it is.
Edu!
Hey, Edu!
Why are you eating that crap?
I promised your parents
we'd watch your cholesterol.
Edu!
Principal!
Ma'am!
Ma'am...
Otegui.
I do not want to disturb you
but I'm worried about
Desiree's Mother's Day drawing.
- It's Mommy.
- Let me see.
How pretty!
I see she smokes.
She has a cigar in her mouth...
It's not a cigar, it's a turd.
It's a turd.
I'd like to speak
to the art teacher.
He quit last month.
- Another one? How many is that?
- I don't know.
Eight. I've been keeping track.
Teachers quitting, accidents,
students having nightmares...
As the only remaining member
of the Parent Association,
I'd like to volunteer
to help save the school.
No, no, no. That's okay Otegui.
I have everything under control.
Ma'am!
The chairlady of the school board
is waiting in your office.
What for?
She must have heard the literature teacher
tried to kill himself
Nine!
Miss Escalonilla,
The school board is extremely uneasy
about recent events at Monforte.
Don't worry, we have plenty
of substitute teachers.
Many parents have talked about
chaos at the school.
I'd say you're up against
a group of rowdy students.
- I'm aware of that...
- Ma'am, if it pleases the court...
This isn't a courtroom.
I don't even know who you are.
Jose Maria Otegui,
President of the Parents Association
and Miss Escalonilla's
new assistant.
- My assistant?
- That's right.
I can vouch for the excellent job
she's done here at Monforte.
I was here when her father
founded the school.
You mean back when the school
made all the front pages?
Well, that was unfortunate.
- It was an accident.
- it should have been closed then.
I want this school running like
a convent by the end of the semester.
Do not worry, we will have this school
flying high again in no time.
Certainly.
Take me to the casino of Aranjuez.
Bye...
Thank you for your help, Otegui.
Anything for Monforte.
The institution comes first.
- Right.
- Even before you.
You have a great resume
plenty of experience...
But why so many schools
in such a short time?
Because none of them...
were good enough.
I knew it. You belong here.
You're just what we need.
Someone professional,
competent, responsible...
Not someone insecure
and mentally unstable.
Are you insecure
and mentally unstable?
Yes. No.
- Yes or no?
- No.
- You said yes before.
- But then I said no.
In that case you'll do just fine.
Excuse me, do you know
where room 4B is?
It's my first day.
We were talking for three hours,
hanging out
I made up some bullshit
and she bought it.
Excuse me, 4B?
Sure, look there...
the red door.
Go up to the last floor,
take the stairs, they're being
remodeled but that's okay,
all the way to the end.
There's an abandoned library.
That's 4B.
- Thank you very much.
- Anytime.
You guys are jackasses.
This is 4B?
Where should I...?
Princess, the books.
Yes I need to know
what books you're using.
Thank you.
- He's not scared.
- What?
Jorge... the chair.
Nothing.
Get the skeleton.
Where's the new teacher?
He hasn't shown up.
Can we bail?
Why isn't he scared?
He probably came
from a public school.
Closer.
What are you doing?
He talked to us.
Hey Guys,
I think the new teacher...
talked to me.
- Modesto.
- I'm leaving.
Already?
- I'm not interested.
- But why?
I lied to you. I'm unstable.
Very unstable, like jello.
Tell me why.
Don't leave like this.
Modesto, at least tell me
what this is about.
The interview went well, right?
Was it something I said?
Modesto, tell me what you saw!
- You see? He can see us!
- I can't see anything!
Shit!
Hello.
Apparently your address is the only
thing true on your resume.
No, please. Wait.
We need to talk.
Please!
You saw something, didn't you?
- I have an appointment with my therapist.
- Listen, I need your help.
Strange things have happened
at school, for years.
He's very good.
By good I mean expensive.
You don't need a therapist,
I saw it with my own eyes.
- What did you see?
- I do not know, you tell me.
This one had a huge belly,
like she's pregnant.
That's right!
Mariví was pregnant when she died.
You believe me?
Of course I do.
I've tried everything.
Medium, parapsychologists,
and nobody ever told me about them.
Well, these...
Modesto, It's not your imagination.
They were students here.
- Is that them?
- I don't know, I can't see anything.
- Did anyone hear you?
- I don't think so.
We're safe in here.
Now concentrate.
We have to be respectful about this.
You mean call them ma'am and sir?
They're here.
- I'm out of here.
- No, no.
We can't break the circle.
This isn't funny.
Put your finger on the glass.
Is anyone there?
YES
Are you of this world?
NO
Okay, who's going first?
Wake up, Romeo.
What?
Snap out of it, bro.
- Short or long version?
- Long version.
Short.
The long version sucks.
Who are you?
I am...
The
Death!
Death.
- Hey, I don't want to die a virgin!
- But you're not a virgin!
I know, but I don't want to die.
Okay, come on.
Seriously.
Who are you?
Hi, Jorge.
I'm Elsa.
Hi!
Were you a student here?
What happened to you?
It was at the school
Christmas party, when my dad
was still principal.
We were celebrating in the gym.
Except for those 5,
who were in detention in the library.
No one knows how it started,
but there was a fire.
- What about the alarm?
- You couldn't hear it over the music.
They all died.
The school was never the same.
Not even my father.
- Is that them again?
- How should I know?
You can see them, right?
You have to help me get rid of them
or the board will close the school.
You can communicate with them,
persuade them to leave.
Talk to them?
To the ghosts?
But that's crazy, right?
You're not crazy.
You never have been.
You really mean it?
I'm not crazy?
I'm not crazy.
"Press the green"
Hello?
I came to talk to you.
I know you're in here
I can see you.
I knew he could see us.
I told you.
Hello.
I know who you are.
I'm here to help you.
Why are you talking like that?
We are ghosts, not retards!
Finally someone can see us
and he's stupid.
- Why can you see us?
- Have you got superpowers?
- Are there more like you?
- Look, feel. He's happy.
Please, one at a time.
- Your Mariví, right?
- Yeah.
- You are...
- Pregnant.
Pregnant.
But I should have had him.
- He's taking his time.
- How did that happen?
Easy. She's a slut
and her boyfriend was a dumb-ass.
- Don't talk shit about my Chema.
- Easy, girls.
I love you, man.
Let's party tonight at Pacha!
What's with him?
He was drunk when he died
and he stayed that way.
This party is eternal, bro.
Pink Floyd, this dude
is full of baloney?
Sorry, kid.
Nobody says "dude"
and "baloney" any more.
Oh, Yeah?
Do students still punch
their teachers in the face?
That's as popular as ever.
But let's calm down.
I'm only here to help.
Why are you here?
Why don't you leave?
We're fine right here.
Where should we go?
I don't know how this works, but...
Isn't there a tunnel of light?
No, just some clown
who came to bust our balls.
Okay, maybe I didn't
make myself clear.
That's an order.
Excuse me.
Go ahead and pop your ankle
back into place first.
Anytime.
"Voices from beyond"
I need your help.
I'm all ears.
I need "your" help.
I'm all ears.
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.
It's a miracle!
Finally you notice me!
I have a problem
with some rowdy students.
You mean special?
Special and handsome?
Rowdy in what sense?
They're dead. Dead bored.
Rebellious? Handsome and rebellious?
My son is a twit,
but are you sure you're not gay?
They make your hole tingle?
The patient continues to suppress
his homo-erotic impulses.
Remember to buy skim milk.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
Okay, we'll talk later, Modesto.
Wait, Modesto. Wait a second.
Wait, wait Modesto!
You're finally talking to me
don't leave now.
I can help you.
Should I take advice
from a suicidal therapist?
I need to talk to someone.
I'm sick of listening to wackos.
Not you, of course.
Tell me, what's their problem?
The same as yours.
- They're sick of my son?
- No, they're dead.
And what business
have they left unfinished?
Unfinished business.
Ghosts who stay in this world
have something to finish.
What's yours?
Plant a tree, write a book...
have a son who isn't an idiot.
I have no idea. Some people know
and others find out later.
But we all need to finish it
to move on.
These don't have
unfinished business,
they have to finish high school.
What is this?
"Essential reading list,
assignment chart, schedule..."
...times?
This looks like...
It's the senior year syllabus...
I missed you!
You're joking.
No.
I checked and I know
what's wrong with you.
When someone dies and gets left here
it's because they have
unfinished business.
And this is yours.
You must be sick of this place
by now.
No.
No one wants to stay in high school forever,
dead or alive.
You don't want to go to somewhere else?
Yes, I want to go to Pacha.
I want to find my Chema.
He probably couldn't get over me
and killed himself.
Sure, he might be dead
You see? Positive thinking.
- Then what we need to do is...
- Pass your senior year.
- We're not going to study now...
- Look, everybody settle down.
I want to help you.
We'll start with something light.
- Let's start with literature?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Angela...
open your book to page 5 and read.
"Literature of the twentieth century.
Chapter One. Introduction.
Anguish is the defining theme
in 20th century literature..."
Yes, Dani?
Yeah, I have a question
Do you know what a nutcracker is?
Nutcracker, nutcracker!
Nutcracker!
Nutcracker!
What if he's right?
Excuse me?
What if we pass
and we get out of here?
The bookworm has spoken.
Angela, we're not going anywhere.
That wacko is lying.
He's not a wacko, he can see you.
So what?
We like this place, don't we?
See those girls over there?
Are they hot or what?
If you were alive, they wouldn't
give you the time of day.
But now...
Watch this!
What are you doing?
I need to possess somebody.
Please, teach me how.
I possessed too many of them
when I was alive.
It's not worth it.
- How was it?
- Awesome.
- Does it hurt the first time?
- Not at all.
What about the living?
It's their body.
The living?
Fuck the living!
Here is the old file.
How about a massage?
A quick rub-down might hit the spot.
No, thanks. Manuela.
I remember that boy...
Daniel Franqueza.
What a shame.
One of the kids from the fire.
Holy Virgin, you don't think...
Things have been creepy here lately.
I don't know who to pray to.
I have St. Rita,
The Sacred Heart of Jesus,
a Hanuman mask and an Assyrian Pazuzu.
I'd have Mohammed,
but I can't find a photo.
That's okay. I just like comparing
today's students to back then.
This Dani, for example.
Assaulting classmates,
disrespecting maintenance staff...
- A real gem
- They are all criminals.
My sister's kid is Latin king.
He speaks in rhymes, and his pants
hang like he took a dump.
Right. But I think this is a special case.
They are all special cases.
I've seen three generations
of kids walk these halls.
and they are all the same.
Dummies listening to music
on their headphones all day long.
What's that?
- It's to play music.
- Where's the cassette?
No cassette,
and a thousand songs fit.
Fuck! How boring it was
to roll up the tape with the pen.
Will you play something modern?
- You did well?
- Very well.
Let's see if you like this.
- What is this?
- It's called reggaeton.
Like salsa, but raunchier.
- You don't like it?
- No.
You're into classic stuff.
How about this?
- That's more like it
- What memories.
Chema and I danced to this
all the time.
- Got any Wham?
- George Michael was beautiful.
He probably married Miss Universe.
No, I think he's still single.
Sure, I bet he sleeps with a lot of women.
What about Nacha Pop?
I love them.They split up.
Antonio Vega is dead.
- And Antonio Flores?
- Dead.
- Michael Jackson?
- Dead.
Fuck! Now I know why
today's music sucks.
- The best always die.
- Fuck, dude.
I was a huge fan
of Michael Jackson.
I dreamed of sleeping at his ranch as a kid.
What else changed?
Since 1986?
Well, Spain won the World Cup.
We are world champions.
You want to hear about it?
There's this little short guy
from Albacete, named Iniesta...
Passes the ball to Iniesta,
split's two defenders, shoots...
Not again!
Damn, I missed the
victory of Spain in the World Cup.
Basketball, tennis, Formula 1...
even the Olympics!
I'm too drunk to process it all.
You know what I miss?
Go to a bookstore, buy a new book
and sniff the pages as if they were freshly baked bread.
I miss my Chema.
All that hair like Don Johnson.
And I miss drinking another glass. Just one more.
Well, two more.
What's wrong with you guys?
We're invisible,
we can move stuff,
walk through walls.
- This isn't a life, Dani.
- Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
Life is Mariví's boyfriend, Angela's books...
This is something else.
- You guys are right.
- This sucks.
I want to pass exams and get out of here.
- I'm with you.
- Me too.
Well...
No, no.
Don't touch me.
You guys are pathetic.
- As a class representative...
- As a representative? Says who?
Always have been.
Are there any other candidates?
Me.
Well, Pink Floyd.
And as a candidate, What do you think
of me if I am your representative?
- Cool.
- Perfect.
As a representative,
I'm pleased to inform you on behalf
of myself and my classmates
that we happily accept
your proposal.
- Is this a joke?
- No.
We want to get out of here.
Sure. I have another one.
The staff room.
There too.
There too?
I swear,
in 9th grade, with Belen Royuela.
Feathered hair, shoulder pads.
The latest fashion.
How about you?
Me? No.
The boys at this school
gross me out.
I would like to be a lesbian,
but I like the girls even less.
Sure you're all talk.
But if I were alive I'd have taken you
to town already.
Honey, if you were alive
I wouldn't have noticed you.
Sure?
Come on, I'm irresistible.
I can see right through you.
I already mentioned,
the music is not good.
We should be more
selective with the staff.
I do not like the new teacher.
- Who, Modesto?
- I saw him talking to himself.
Yeah, he likes to rehearse
before class.
That's not all. I've seen him
masturbating against a tree.
What's up?
Did someone died?
It's for the Founder's Day, the most
important event of the year,
and I'm organizing it
The Founder's Day? And what do they do...
bring out tanks and have the kids
parade back and forth?
It's a tribute to her dead father,
idiot.
I'm sure it's a very nice party.
It's not a party.
It's a tribute we do for my father
each year on the last day of school.
- You should throw a party.
- Do I need to remind you
- what happened at Monforte's last party?
- Tell me about it, dude.
We need to invite the chairlady...
Better not risk it.
If something goes wrong, I'm dead.
Do not worry, I'll make sure
everything is perfect.
Next year, Otegui,
alright?
- I have to pick up Desiree.
- Otegui...
You have a beautiful voice.
Dani. You can laugh at them,
but don't make fun of me.
I'm serious. I don't know why
you never joined the choir.
It was my dream, but my parents
would not let me.
They said it took away my study time.
Well, now they
are not here.
Go on, no one will hear you anyway.
- And what is that'?
- What?
That.
Shit.
It's Death!
Give me the chairlady
of the school board, please.
Angela told me everything.
Dude, what's your problem?
I do not know, dude.
You tell me, dude.
Screwing the living is different
from screwing each other.
And what do you know? You're kissing
that teacher's ass the whole time.
He just wants to help us.
- I thought we were a team.
- A team?
You're going solo, chasing that
living girl around everywhere.
- That's not true.
- No?
Dani, don't even think about it.
Dani...
Dani, don't.
Dani!
Dani!
Don't worry, you've still got
the Ouija board.
And what you got?
I wish you were alive
so I could kiss you.
Sometimes, without you noticing
I put myself at your side and nibble your ear.
I'd give anything to be inside you.
I wish I were alive...
My God, to chat with a dead guy.
Forgive me, Lord.
I'm just so lonely...
Sometimes...
I sneak up on you...
And nibble your ear...
Science. Question.
For one point.
What is the scientific
name for the study of blood?
- Mariví?
- Bloodology.
Again.
Hematology.
Another point for Angela,
That makes 8.
Next question.
Focus, literature.
Two points.
What was Damaso Alonso talking about
when he called Madrid a city
of one million cadavers?
Pink Floyd?
A plague of zombies?
There were no zombies in Generation '27
or the discovery of America
or the French Revolution.
- Zombies do not exist.
- Not even ghosts. Don't tell me.
Again.
He was talking about how sad life
was in Madrid after the war.
It's from "Children of Wrath."
What'? I've been hearing this crap
in the halls for 20 years.
Guys, sorry to interrupt.
Got a second?
We have a problem.
Look how the puppy dog runs off
when his master calls.
Dude, where were you?
- What's up?
- It just arrived.
The chairlady confirmed
she's attending Founder's Day.
- Why did you invite her?
- I didn't.
Well then?
Otegui.
If they're here something
is bound to go wrong.
She'll fire me
and I'll lose my father's school...
Stay calm, it's gonna be okay.
Things are improving,
even Dani started studying.
That's not enough.
They have to be gone by Founder's Day.
I'll find a way to pass them
before that.
- You promise?
- Yes.
Modesto...
Is there anything I can do
to make you feel better?
This school is falling apart.
My father would roll over
in his grave if he saw it.
Come on, don't say that.
He's sitting right next to you.
He says he's proud of you.
- Are you serious?
- No, I'm kidding.
But I'm sure that's what he thinks.
Another cupcake?
Do you think they're happy?
I speak of the dead.
I think it's like when you're alive.
Some are happy,
some are sad...
some are little pricks...
I thinks the bad thing isn't dying,
it's not living life to the fullest.
You, for example.
What's the craziest thing
you've done lately?
I underwent psychiatric treatment,
that's pretty crazy.
No, I mean something spontaneous,
something you don't normally do.
For example, would you dance
right now if I asked you to?
Yes.
Yes.
Dance with me, Modesto.
We need to study.
We need to study more.
There's no time to waste.
- You little pricks!
- We just wanted to help.
We put her on a platter for you.
You're too soft.
Women like to be treated rough.
Rough?
I'll show you rough.
SLUT
Pink Floyd!
Stop mess up the calendar, dude!
Tt's occupied!
- You've been in there for an hour!
- Let us in.
I ate a kiwi,
and I look totally fat.
Come on, we'll puke real quick
and then go.
I can't, I'm shooting up.
- You're crazy.
- Heroin is totally out.
I'm sick of this place.
Me too.
That's why I'm getting out of here.
I'm leaving.
How about I go with you?
What do you mean?
I have no guy friends, or girl friends,
or boyfriend...
I'm bored.
What then?
Kill yourself for me?
I'm afraid of commitment.
Do not get cocky.
It wouldn't be my first time.
My God, you're crazy.
Well? When do we do it?
Alright, you guys.
It's time.
It was a pleasure to be your teacher.
I've had a lot of fun teaching you,
and you gave it your all.
No matter what happens,
I'm very proud of you.
Hello. Is Jorge here?
- Jorge?
- Yeah.
I just wanted to wish him good luck for the exam.
Jorge?
Anyway...
I love you.
See you soon, okay!
Bye.
Goodbye.
What did she mean by
"see you soon"?
If you really like her,
don't do anything stupid.
What do you know?
You're the one who runs away
whenever the principal gets close.
You can turn the sheets.
Pink Floyd, here.
Please, try to concentrate.
Copy this.
I've corrected your exams
and calculate your average grade.
- Angela...
- Yes.
- A+.
- Yes!
- Jorge, C.
- Yes.
- Mariví, B+.
- Yes!
Pink Floyd, I do not know how you did it,
but you got C-.
Though your handwriting...
- Hey, try writing drunk some time.
- Dani...
Dani, I do not understand.
Your answers were lazy.
Questions were left blank.
You knew the Damaso Alonso question
and didn't answer it.
You got a D.
But you did try hard in class.
So I'm giving you a C-
You all pass.
Come on!
You did it.
I think your time is arrived.
I can hear Michael.
That's supposed to be
angles in heaven?
You sound like a herd of goats!
This is heaven?
That sucks!
Where's 'Michael Jackson?
- What's going on?
- What did we go wrong?
- Technically you passed the exams.
- Technically we studied our asses off.
- You lied to us!
- Wait a minute.
- I told you.
- Stay calm.
Oh God, I'm going to vomit.
Somebody told me that would work,
- I swear.
- Shut up!
You were screwing with us
all along.
We're going to turn this school into a living hell.
How did it go?
Fine.
Well, average.
I'm sorry.
They're new.
- I'm feeling much better.
- Well, I'll have you readmitted. Sit down.
Ok. I'll just extend your sick leave.
What do we do?
What's going on...
- ...here?
- It's okay, Otegui. Things are under control.
Founder's Day is the day after tomorrow.
This is his fault, right?
Modesto helped us.
Yeah, I can see that. Things have
never been worse since he got here.
Well, I don't know...
Are you okay?
What advice would you give me?!
- You're the worst psychiatrist in the world.
- I know.
My father said the same thing.
Besides, I psychoanalyzed myself.
I'm gay.
I'm sorry, but you're not
right in the head.
I hate you.
But hey, I love you too.
- The hole!
- Oh, God.
Somebody please get me out of here.
I'd rather go to hell.
You said they'd leave
if they passed.
I said they had unfinished business.
Graduating was your idea.
- Then what do they have to do?
- Wanting to leave would be a start.
They all wanted to.
Well, except for Dani.
Maybe you got under their skin.
Dead people can be the nastiest
sons of bitches around.
No, that was before.
They trusted me.
Except Dani.
What about guilt?
In the end, dying is like
going to therapy:
You have to accept you as you are
and hope that the bill isn't too big.
Guilty? They have nothing to confess.
They weren't delinquents.
Well, except...
I know why they can't leave.
Hello.
Modesto, Thank you for coming.
We were just talking about you.
My daughter is suicidal
because of you.
She wants to join her boyfriend.
Her dead boyfriend!
We don't want a crazy person
teaching our kids.
Hold on, I'm not crazy.
I was crazy!
I saw you talking to yourself.
And don't make me tell everyone
about your tree fetish.
I was obliged to check references.
Here they are:
Modesto has been fired from 7 schools
for his behavior.
So what we're all wondering is,
how did he get a job
here at Monforte?
Okay, do you want the truth '?
I'll tell you the truth.
The truth is ever since I was a kid
I've been able to help
special people.
People not like you and me.
- Poor people?
- No, people...
- ...trapped between two worlds.
- Western Sahara?
Dead people, damn it!
Are you finished?
I think you should gather
your things and leave.
This is decided by her.
She agrees.
She just accepted our proposal.
- All this time studying for nothing.
- I hate to say "I told you so..."
- but I told you so!
- Fine, I was wrong about passing your exams.
I am very sorry.
But the unfinished business thing is true,
and you can't leave here
until you finish it.
I don't know what it is,
you will have to find out for yourself,
but if you're trapped here
together,
it must be because
you have to leave together.
So maybe what we need to do
is start thinking about
what you have in common.
You're supposedly good friends, right?
Let's see if you're really
good friends like you say you are.
If you've really told each other everything,
because one of you might be
keeping a secret.
A secret that involves everyone.
If that's the case,
it's time to come clean, isn't it?
- Shut up.
- Why?
I said shut up, damn it.
Dani,
you know that I admire you,
but not because
you're the toughest.
Maybe you think getting angry
is brave.
But I think bravery
is something else.
Take it from me.
I'm a chickenshit.
I understand you're afraid,
I would be too.
But they're your friends.
They deserve to know.
I only wanted to set off
the fire alarm.
You started the fire?
It was you?
I wanted them to let us
go to the party.
They were all having a good time
and we were locked up in here.
You're a liar.
I thought you were my friend.
Why didn't you say anything?
- I was scared.
- Scared of what?
What if I leave here
and end up somewhere worse?
Where are you going?
Home. I got fired.
Modesto. Modesto,
please. I'm sorry.
I had no choice.
I can't lose my father's school.
It's your school now.
Do you know what the difference
between you and me?
It took a whole bunch of dead people
to ruin my life.
It took only one to ruin yours.
And watching "Knight Rider"
my friends all noticed Kitt,
I noticed Michael Knight.
His hair, hairy chest, everything.
My father did not know, I didn't tell him
and I do not want to disappoint him.
I knew it. It wasn't his being gay
that disappointed me
it was his being stupid.
Your father's very proud of you.
Really? I knew it.
Hey, don't exaggerate.
- Was he at my school musical?
- No.
- In the last row. He cried.
- Cried?
It was "The Sound of Music"
and he played the nanny.
It was "The Sound of Music"
and I played the nanny. I nailed it.
Yeah. The best version of Do-Re-Mi
I've ever heard.
You know what I think?
If he wanted to leave
he would have by now.
He doesn't want to leave you alone,
he's your father and he loves you,
that's why he's there
right next to you
- Right.
- Yours or mine?
Yours.
He's here to watch over you.
and he'll never leave your side.
What a bastard.
You nailed it.
I could never leave
this dummy alone.
I can't remember.
TINA CALLING
Modesto, it's Tina.
If you get this message
or any of the other 15 I left you,
Please call me back.
Manuela, read this announcement
over the loudspeaker.
All the students of Monforte
who are not alive,
please meet the principal
in the old library. I repeat,
All Monforte students
who are not alive,
please meet the principal
in the old library.
Thank you.
A little voodoo could fix this
in no time.
- You mean sacrificing a few chickens?
- Only one.
Then no.
You eat chicken every day!
I don't know what to do, guys.
I've called him a thousand times
he wants nothing to do with me.
And I don't blame him.
We let him down.
Me more than anyone.
I need your help.
Help me.
You see? We're late.
I told you guys.
I miss him.
And I know you do, too.
But I can't bring him back.
She's right. Modesto was the only one
who ever tried to help us.
And what do we do?
Well...
I have an idea.
Spirit's, leave the school alone.
Take me instead.
Someone has to go in there.
Let me. that might be
my unfinished business.
I doubt it,
but if you want to do, do it.
And 'your first time.
Do not you want it to be special?
It's my first time.
That already is special.
Come on in, make the call and get out.
I'm the whore of Babylon!
This woman scares me.
It's no big deal.
Hurry up, before she kills
the chicken.
Cool.
- Yeah?
- Modesto?
I'm the old lady,
from administration.
- Manuela?
- Yes, that one.
Are you okay?
You have a strange voice.
I'm calling because you have
to come to school right away
to sign of very important documents.
- My severance?
- Severance? What's that?
Yeah, right.
Severance.
- But I have already 'signed it.
- No, but...
Damn! But it's a different severance,
much bigger.
If Tina put you up to this,
tell her I'm not coming back.
No, this isn't about Tina.
Well, sort of...
Tina asked me to call you,
she's embarrassed because...
Well, dude, she says
she's in love with you.
What?
She's in love with me?
What do you mean?
Is that what she said?
Told me to my face.
She said Modesto is hot.
He gets my panties wet.
- She said Modesto?
- Yeah, totally.
- Do you swear?
- Pinky promise,
cross my heart and hope to die,
stick a needle in my eye.
Well, I might come by later.
Do not tell her anything, okay?
Awesome, dude.
Catch you later.
Honey...
I hope it was good for you,
because I didn't feel a thing.
My chicken!
If that fails,
we'll have to stay here forever.
It's all because of Dani.
I wonder why he kept it from us
for so long.
Sometimes people have difficulty
saying certain things.
Certain things? Angela,
it's his fault we're dead.
Maybe he was afraid of our reaction.
What?
Angela Perez Blanco,
why are you defending him?
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no. Yes, yes.
And you have something
to tell me.
This was my old locker.
You should know
I didn't give this to you before
because you've been a bitch to me
all these years.
Then, during the party
Chema put this in my locker
by mistake.
Chema? My Chema?
Yeah, but I never read it.
I just kept it to get back at you.
My letter!
"I know it's weird I'm writing you,
but there are things I'm too scared
to say to your face."
He was so shy.
"I'm going to London next year
to study
and my uncle promised me a job
in his bank when I get back."
He was a keeper.
"Getting married right now
would ruin my future,
and my parents can't know
my girlfriend is pregnant."
Give it to me.
Do not continue!
"I'm not even sure the baby is mine.
I think you better just forget me."
I didn't know.
FOUNDER'S DAY
Ma'am.
- Ma'am, hurry up.
- I'm coming.
- Come on.
- I'm coming.
The chairlady will be here
any minute.
A moment!
Cheer up, sweetie. Yesterday
I took care of our problem.
You killed the chicken?
Even better.
I fucked a spirit.
This is the beginning of a new era
for Monforte.
Your Excellency...
Mr. Annoying.
You'll love our wonderful
Founder's Day celebration
which I humbly organized myself.
If you need anything, our highest ranking officials
are at your service
Yours truly and...
Manuela,
our secretary.
Your Highness.
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here,
she asks.
Don't pretend,
Manuela told me.
Told you what?
You're no longer
angry with me?
You're beautiful.
- What are you doing?
- Aren't you...?
Teach, come back!
Forgive us!
We're so sorry, Modesto!
- Stay!
- Please.
What is he doing here?
- He's back to help us.
- Is he crazy?
He's not crazy, Otegui.
Extraordinary things
are happening in this school.
- You're crazier than he is.
- Otegui, please!
Absolutely nothing is happening in this school!
You still don't believe me?
Stop this!
This is all your fault.
You're insulting the school board
and your father's memory.
Leave him out of this.
I'm sick of you always
talking about him.
He would never have approved
of that circus and neither do I.
Get it into your head already.
This school's principal
is Tina Escalonilla,
not Antonio Escalonilla,
and certainly not Jose Maria Otegui.
Jose Maria?
Chema?
Is that you?
What happened to you?
Your hair...
You're a bastard, a coward
and a son of a bitch!
Modesto, tell him he's a bastard,
a coward and a son of a bitch.
The chairlady will see this disaster.
Tomorrow I'm proposing
your termination.
Does the name Mariví Herrera
ring a bell?
She's standing right next to you.
You got her pregnant
and then dumped her.
The board would be very interested
to hear about this.
The Board is going to hear about
some other things first.
Ma'am.
I would like to speak to you privately.
Can't anyone here respect
these poor students trying to sing?
Do you mind?
There isn't going well.
I have an idea.
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.
But everyone is sleeping.
Can't you liven it up a bit?
Do you want another stampede? No.
Exactly the opposite.
I think you'll like this better.

There's no place at Monforte
for that sort of music.
This has gone too far.
Chairlady, ma'am,
strange things
have been happening lately.
And it's the principal's fault.
Tina Escalonilla
in recent times has shown clear signs of
what can only be
a severe mental imbalance.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Therefore I have proposed
a series of changes
for this school.
You gave me an idea.
First,
...to help students
get better grades,
we'll require them
to take drugs.
Cocaine for exams,
amphetamines, speed, Pot, LSD...
All of them.
As many as possible.
I know where to buy cheap.
Two, a new required course:
Sex Education.
But nothing stuffy.
With professionals.
Prostitutes and gigolos to teach students
useful things,
cunnilingus,
anal,
fellatio...
Ah, I almost forgot.
Sex with animals.
And stuff for people
who get off on poo.
And three, a change of uniform.
This one is old-fashioned.
I propose nudism.
I'm sorry, you guys.
This could be our official greeting.
Peek-a-boo!
That's why I think I should be
the new principal next year.
Thank you, Mr. Otegui.
We appreciate your proposal.
To follow the sophisticated humor
of the President
of the Parents Association,
I would like to thank the chairlady
For being here with us today.
Thank you very much.
Oh, and one more thing.
This school is bringing back
an old tradition. The party.
Just look at them.
How can they wear those pants?
I can see your underwear!
Damn, nice tit's.
- Hey.
- Hello.
- Here is the artist!
- Wow, you sure kept that quiet!
I loved it.
Even my baby was dancing.
- You liked it?
- Very much.
- Sing a summer hit.
- Hey.
Guys, I'm sorry.
For everything I've done.
You were awesome.
I was selfish.
Well,
we all are sometimes.
I have to go.
- Pink Floyd, do not cry.
- I forgive him.
No, no...
Elsa, look at me.
Modesto!
Elsa, Please!
Elsa.
Elsa, please.
Jorge?
You're better-looking
than in the photo.
Why did you do it?
Because I love you.
I love you too.
But you have your whole life
ahead of you
You have to experience everything
I couldn't.
But I want to be with you.
One day.
I promise you.
He'll miss you too.
Jorge, Angela, Mariví, Dani.
If you had some unfinished business,
I think you have done it perfectly.
- You are the last one, Pink Floyd.
- Me?
I don't have any goals.
I just want to go to Pacha.
The Pacha!
Modesto.
We have a problem.
I haven't got ID.
Don't worry,
I know the doorman...
Come on, it's time to have fun!
Are you people dead or what?
Here we go!
You're lucky you can't see me,
blondie.
It's Pink Floyd.
What's wrong?
My head is killing me,
like it's going to explode.
And my throat is dry.
Super dry.
Someone spiked my drink, Modesto.
Look at me, look at me.
- Did you feel dizzy?
- Dizziness?
I'll never drink again,
for the rest of my life.
I just want to lie down
until it goes away.
What you have is a huge hangover.
Dim the lights, damn it.
This is it.
Guys, I think you're leaving
this time.
I hope I can give birth up there.
It's moving a lot.
Prof.
Thank you.
Dude, who gave you this shit?
Modesto.
You know what
the difference between you and me?
No.
Me neither.
