I'm pretty hungry. I hope
we catch some fish soon.
-Me too.
-Hey, help me wind.
-The line back? -You wanna try this
one? -I'm trying to do this... -Slowly.
- Slowly. Slowly...
- I am doing it slowly. -Ok, you got it!
Oh Matty, look! You see that?
See that big boat out there?
She is the prettiest boat on Whidbey
lsland. That's the "Morning Star".
Some day when you're big
enough, I'm gonna teach you
how to sail. It's the best
thing there is, sailing.
- Better than fishing?
- Yep. But you know what, kiddo?
-I don't think I want you to grow up. -Why?
What if you grow up and
marry some beautiful girl?
- Who's going to sail with me then?
- Dad?
Not a chance.
- Nick, uh, we need to talk.
- Always happy to talk to you, Rudy.
Hey, Warren.
You get that notice
from First Seattle today?
Yeah, yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
Then you know we've got a real problem.
First Seattle is not a problem, Rudy.
Martini's are a problem.
Do you mind?
Where were we? First Seattle...
- Mommy.
- Hey, kiddo.
- How's it going?
- And, hand-off.
-Oh, he's a sack of potatoes.
-Hey,hey.
Have you been carrying him
around the whole party?
-Yeah, I´m never gonna marry
you off, Angie.
And...yes.
Picasso. Blue period.
The artist's name is Kandinsky.
Wassily Kandinsky.
He's German, of Russian extraction.
1866 to 1944.
And by the way, Picasso's blue period
was figurative, and ended in 1904.
And these watercolours are abstract.
Done in 1911.
Picasso.
Everyone, pipe down.
I'm about to give a speech.
Thank you for coming. I always
say the sign of a good party
is when I'm having a better
time than anyone else.
But, now is the time when
you're expected to ante up, for
drinking all my liquor,
and eating all my food.
And spilling tomato sauce on my couch...
Bobby Long... -Oooo!
What? You didn't think I saw you, did you?
- Oh, he's insufferable.
-I know it.
We're all here to raise a vast sum of
money for the Small Frye School, right?
So, while you are reaching
for your check books...
It gives me great pleasure to
introduce Mrs. Rebecca Tingley,
our totally ravishing and
completely adorable headmistress.
Mr Parsons. Thank you.
First of all, I'd like to start
by introducing
a few members of my
valuable staff to you today.
-Oh God!
-I give you our dedicated teacher,
and head of admissions,
Miss Angela Green.
Yay! Yay!
What are you thinking about?
- Was I always as rude as I am now?
- Absolutely.
Hi.
Come have a seat.
Angela do you think we ought
to break the news to her?
I suppose it´s better she hears it
from us than from someone else.
- She's not going to be happy about it.
- What's up, guys?
Close your eyes. Close 'em.
Ok. Stand up. Closed? Hmm...
- Now, Libby, what is your favorite thing?
- Me?
Not even close.
All right, open.
I heard Sean give Marcel a hard
time and I made him an offer.
And he agreed to let us take her out for
the weekend. And if you like it, it's yours.
-If I like it?
-Mmm hmmm.
-Honey, we can't afford that!
-When have I ever let that get in my way?
C'mon.
What about Matty?
I'll take care of him.
You'll have a great time!
- You hate to sail.
- I can learn.
Generally, a wine like this
needs time to breathe.
Nah, no, I don't think we should... wait.
I don't see land.
So where is it?
Alaska's over that way,
Japan is straight ahead,
and Australia is somewhere
to the left.
- Where would you like to go?
- To bed.
That can be arranged.
- We should do this more often.
- What, buy expensive sailboats?
If this is what happens,
I'll buy you another one tomorrow.
No, go away, just the two of us,
with nobody else around.
I'll drink to that.
Nick?
Nick?
Oh, my God...
Nick?
Nick...?
Nick?
Nick?!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Nick?
Morning Star! This is the Coastguard.
Put the knife down now and step away.
I... I don't know...
I don't know...where my...husband is.
...of a local businessman...
Nicholas Parsons...
who disappeared in these
waters...off of Whidbey island...
Hey, Tom.
What'd you got?
- Anything?
- No.
Cutter, please don't let them give up.
He's very strong. He's a very strong man.
Libby! The raft and life preservers
are all on board.
These guys tracked the wind,
the currents...
Uh...There's nothing.
The water temperature overnight
was 51 degrees. That's cold.
That's really cold.
God, I can't breathe.
Just put your head down.
Yes, that's it. That's it.
Deep breaths. Take big breaths. Easy...
Mommy, look!
Hi, kiddo.
Hey, Bobby.
Hey, Libby.
Um, well, Cutter he, uh, he asked me
to come by and talk to you, you know.
Just, uh, not as an attorney,
just as a friend.
The inquest was held this morning.
And they reviewed all the evidence
and Nick, eh, well he's
officially been declared dead.
Well, Libby, uh, they ah, determined it was
a wrongful death, and you...
Oh, Jesus... You're being
formally charged with his murder.
And I'm here to advise you, make no
statements whatsoever to the sheriff.
I'm sorry, Libby.
Cutter!
Not in front of my kid, okay?
I'm sorry, Libby, uh...
The judge denied us bail.
Can Angie keep looking after Matty?
Good.
Okay...uh...
Let's, uh, take a look at this,
see what we can do.
Bobby, here's what I think happened.
I had some wine, ok? And I fell asleep.
It must have been the sun.
And maybe Nick was trying to cut
a snagged line or something, because...
the knife from the galley
was on deck.
And...and maybe the boat pitched
or something, and he cut himself.
And he tried to come downstairs, he
tried to come below to wake me up.
I quit these things when I met Nick.
It'll be all right. I promise you.
So, why don't we take a look
at this First Guarantee Life?
Now, you both bought life insurance policies
from the company around 4 months ago.
- And you are the beneficiary?
- I'm his wife.
Libby, you don't suppose
he's worth two million?
Nick wanted to make sure that if
anything ever happened to him we'd be okay.
I was afraid the jury may feel
there's a big difference between ok
and 2 million dollars.
They may see it as a motive.
Is that what they're saying out there?
No, one is saying...I don't think
we have to be concerned about something...
That I killed Nick for money?
-I mean, I know we had some problems,
and Nick worried, but we were okay. -Libby!
Two of his investors
were suing him for embezzlement.
First Seattle issued a lien on all of his
real estate properties, and
your personal possessions...
Nick's death means all these
little problems disappeared behind a
corporate shield, leaving
you with two million dollars.
Do you think I killed him?
It's the first rule of being a lawyer.
What we think doesn't matter.
It matters to me.
No, of course,
I don't think you killed him.
Petty officer Young. What was
the condition of the Morning Star's
marine-band radio when you
had a chance to inspect it?
The handset cord had been cut.
And as you initially
approached the sailboat,
...what did you see?
- Mrs. Parsons was holding a knife.
I show you State's exhibit
number four.
Uh, mayday, mayday,
this is uh, the "Morning Star".
- State your emergency, Morning Star.
- I've, I've been stabbed.
I'm bleeding. Uh, oh, Jesus...
My name, my name is uh, Nicholas Parsons.
- State your position?
- I don't know, man!
Three miles northwest of
Whidbey lsland, I guess.
Oh, God!
Mrs Parsons, you've heard the
testimony presented to this court,
and your explanation is that somebody
must have come aboard the Morning Star.
That's right.
Well, let's consider
all the possibilities.
Maybe a band of pirates. Or aliens.
Did aliens murder your husband?
No, aliens weren't beneficiaries in
your husband's life insurance.
- Objection. Your honor, the prosecutor...
- Overruled.
I told you what happened.
Yes you did. You told us that
you were asleep.
Yes.
Maybe you were sleep walking
when you stabbed your husband to death.
Objection! Please! Miss Honeywell's
not questioning the witness,
or making a closing argument.
-Withdrawn!
I didn't kill my husband.
I loved my husband.
I did not kill my husband!
You have to believe me.
I'm sorry, Libby.
It's not your fault, Bobby.
I want to ask you something, Angie.
I'd like you to adopt my son.
- Oh no, Libby, I can't do that. Not to you.
- I've thought it through.
I barely survived my parents' house.
I'm not going to put him there.
Money won't be a problem because
there's the 2 million dollars from
the life insurance and it's going
into a trust fund in his name.
- It isn't about money.
- I know.
Matty loves you.
We can't let him become
a ward of the State.
Thank you.
Hey kiddo, come see me.
You're going to stay with Angie
for a while. Ok, kiddo? -Ok.
And you're going to have lots of fun.
And I know you're going to be a good boy.
Yes, Mommy.
As soon as all this is over,
we'll be together again.
That's a promise, kiddo.
I love you.
I love you too.
- Who's this?
- Rich bitch from Whidbey lsland.
- She ain't gonna make it.
- What do you think? A year?
Five cartons says she offs herself
inside of six months.
Get away from me.
Hey, take it easy! We yo'
new best friends.
Heard you did your husband.
He probably deserved it.
Mine did.
- I know what a pain it is to get here.
- I taught him how to say the ABC's.
- Is that true?
- Yes.
Did you learn the alphabet, sweetie?
Can you tell me?
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
H, l, J, K, L, M, N, O, P,
Q, R, S, T, U, V,
W, X, Y and Z.
Now I know my ABC's
next time won't you sing with me
- Give it up. Come on.
- Get off that phone, bitch.
Ooo, you're low on cigarettes.
D'ya wanna make any friends?
I advise you buy another pack fast.
On account of your personality
it ain't the best I've ever seen.
I hear you're trying to reach your friend,
the one with your boy?
Yeah, I can't find him.
He disappeared.
Oh hon, if you could disappear that easy,
believe me, I wouldn't be here right now.
Me either.
Think! Use your head.
There's got to be a way
to track him down.
- Small Frye School. Front office.
- Hello, this is Angela Green calling.
Angie, it's Jennifer.
- Yes, hi! How are you?
Yes, it's nice to hear your voice.
Listen, I haven't got a
severance check in a while,
and I was hoping that
I could verify with you
that you have my correct mailing
address and phone number?
- Sure, I'll check. Can you hold on a sec?
- Yes, of course. Thank you.
Yeah, I have it right here.
Now tell me if this is right.
3321 Mason Street,
San Francisco 94105.
And the phone number is 415...
- Hello?
- Angie? Angie!
Libby, I've...I've tried to
call you a thousand times.
Is Matty okay? Where is he?
- Everything is fine.
- What are you doing in San Francisco?
- Put him on the phone.
- Hey, why are you acting this way?
Because, you disappeared! And
I haven't seen my son in a month!
- I was just about to call you.
- Oh, bullshit!
- How can you move and not tell me, Angie?
- We were coming to see you next week.
Just put Matty on the phone.
Matty, it's Mommy. Come say "hi".
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hello, sweetie-pie.
Oh, how are you, Matty?
I think about you all the time.
Honey, I miss you so much.
Are you doing okay, kiddo?
I love you.
Listen, Matty, I know that
this has been really hard,
but Angie's going to bring you
up to see me next week, ok?
Yes, Mommy...
Daddy!
Nick??
Nick !!!
He was in San Francisco last night.
I had a phone number,
but it's already been disconnected.
No, I don't have a
forwarding address. He's gone.
Well, don't you have investigators?
Doesn't your company want
to get it's 2 million dollars back?
Why aren't you listening to me?!
I am innocent!!
...Yeah, you are!...
...We're ALL innocent!...
Put some elbow grease behind that stirring,
nobody wants to eat any burnt tapioca.
- Does it smell like it's burning?
- Oh, I swear you got shit for brains, girl.
You're in prison,
do you get that?
Nobody wants to listen to anybody in prison.
So you can just forget about re-opening
your case, or a jailhouse
appeal, you got that?
They take years, and
they're 95% unsuccessful.
So if you want my advice...-No. -Well,
you're gonna get it. You do your time!
What are you now, a lawyer?
Once upon a time...
But they tend to disbar murderers. And
here's your Christmas present... You ready?
Pay attention, coz this is the best
goddamn advice you ever gonna get.
You ever hear of something
called double jeopardy,
fifth amendment,
of the constitution? -Huh?
Well, double jeopardy
provides that no person may be
tried for the same crime twice.
You got that?
Keep stirring. The State says
you already killed your husband.
They can't convict you of it a second time.
That means that when you
leave here, you track him down...
And when you find him,
you can kill him!
That's right! You can walk right
up to him in Times Square, put
a gun to his head and
pull the fucking trigger,
and there's nothing
anybody can do about it!
Kinda makes you feel warm
and tingly all over, don't it?
That's right! Keep stirring.
I got to hand it to you, honey,
it's just sheer hate driving you on.
Honey, the only way you're
gonna look like that is if I
staple the picture to your
forehead. Just trust me, ok?
Mattys eighth birthday, honey.
You know, I read that even if a child is
separated from its mother the day it´s born,
it never forgets her voice.
Think that's true?
Of course, I do.
I feel like l've grown
these past six years.
Well, honey they don't wanna hear that
you've turned into some kind of tree, ok?
So you just repeat after me: "If I could
trade places with my husband, I would."
Oh, if I could trade places
with my husband, I would.
That´s good, now throw in alot
of that born-again Jesus stuff, all right.
Now listen, listen, listen...
I want you to start with this:
l'm not sitting in front of
you today to make excuses...
I'm not sitting in front of you today
to try and make any excuses.
I killed my husband.
I've had to live with that
every day for the past six years.
But, I swear to you that
I'm a changed person.
Why should we believe you?
I don´t think I can't ask you to believe me.
All I can really do is believe in myself.
And know that if I were given a chance,
I can do something good with my life.
Make up for the wrong I did.
-Oh, Mommy! -Yeah! -Yay, talk to me!
Man, did you see that?
"...if all those people who did that
just showed up here..."
- The man's across the hall.
- Thanks.
"Yeah, let's imagine that they all
showed up here and apologized..."
Come in.
- I'm Elizabeth Parsons.
- What do you have in that box?
Elizabeth Parsons...
The state of Washington has
granted you a conditional parole.
For the next 3 years, you'll
observe all the rules of this facility,
which means no fighting, no
fornicating, no drinking, no drugs,
- no exceptions, no excuses.
Do you understand that? - Yes.
This is your social security card. You
will find gainful and sustained employment.
You're not to carry a firearm or a weapon
of any kind, especially a knife.
Curfew's at 8:30.
This is my cell-phone number.
Do not lose it.
If you think there's a chance
you'll be even five minutes late,
you will call me. I will have you
picked up. Do you understand that? Ok.
Any violation of these conditions,
and your "get-out-of-jail-free-card"
will be revoked by me.
And you'll return to prison to serve
the remainder of your sentence,
and maybe then some.
Look right here.
- Is this a problem for you?
- No.
- Yes, it is. You want to tell me about it?
- No.
I'm gonna have trouble with you, Parsons.
No sir, no you're not.
I learned my lesson, I just want to...
I'm not interested in your goddamn
contrition. I'm interested in your
behaviour. Get out of here
and behave yourself.
You're in room 8,
on the second floor.
You're never going to get
anywhere like that. Here...
Hmmm, nice shampoo...
Now, uh, what are you looking for?
Uh, a friend I haven't
seen in a couple of years.
Someone said I
should try the internet.
It's a...boyfriend...?
- Girl.
- Ok, well, in that case, I'll help you.
- Uh, does your friend have e-mail?
- I have no idea.
Okay, c'mon, let's do some surfing.
So, uh, what's your friend's name?
- Angela Green.
- Eh, zip code?
Hmm...How 'bout a social security
number? That way we could run
a credit report, it would
give us her address. -Nope.
- She was a schoolteacher.
- Done deal.
And... voilà!
Now, uh, maybe when this thing
has finished it's searching
we could go to this, uh,
this neat little bar I know,
and, uh, have a little drink.
What do you say?
Yeah, I just have to check in
with my parole officer first.
- You've been to jail? - Actually prison.
Jail is a different thing.
So, what did you do,
not pay your parking tickets?
Oh no, I was convicted
of murdering my husband.
- You're kidding, right?
- No, I'm not, um...
Sliced and diced, the paper's
call it... Can you believe that?
- You're not kidding.
- No, I said I wasn't.
But it'd be nice to have a drink.
I haven't been out in a long time.
Oh! Oh look, I just remembered
I have, um, this appointment...
- See ya!
See ya...sorry...
Oh, the book. See ya.
Oh, my God.
So he takes me out for dinner
and he feeds me escargots.
D'ya know what those are? Snails!
Snails? Yuk!
Well anyway, the moment I go to bed
with him, this asshole dumps me.
Ruby, do not insult me
by raising your voice.
I'm standing right here and
I can hear you just fine.
By the way, I don't like it
when you call me dirty names.
Please Mr. Lehman, don't do this
to me, man. Ok? I didn't do nothing.
Where were you this afternoon, Ruby?
- I was...I was at my job.
-You were down on Pike Street
wearin' lime green hot pants and
fishnet stockings, is where you were...
I was on my way to work, man!
At McDonald's? In those clothes?!
You haven't been to work
in a week! Get your stuff!
Look, I'm sorry, man.
I won't do it again.
I will never do that shit again.
And I promise that.
You blew off your parole,
you're going back. It's that simple.
- You fuck. You fuckin' cocksucker!
- You have a dirty mouth, Ruby.
I want one chance. I just want one chance!
God damn you! Motherfucker!
You sonofabitch! You mean
fucker! You send me back there
and they'll kill me,
you mean sonofabitch!
Fuck you! Fucking asshole!
Show's over! Go to sleep!
You think I'm a mean son of a bitch?
I think you could have
given her a second chance.
There are no second
chances in this house, lady.
This is the last-chance house.
And try to understand that!
What the hell is wrong
with that guy?
Well, I heard the man used to
be some college whatchamacallit...
- A law teacher, or something?
-Yea, that's right, that's right.
You're kidding? How does a law
professor end up some place like this?
Coz Life's a bitch.
Bitch my ass! He got a DUI
and totalled his car.
I heard he totalled his wife
and his daughter in that accident.
Girl, you talkin' shit!
Nobody got killed.
Look, but by the time his wife
got done with him,
I bet he wished she was dead.
Took everything he had.
Including the kid.
He hasn't seen his girl in years.
Libby, it's wrong of you
to be here. It's very wrong.
I'm sorry to bother you,
but you're my only hope.
Sharon, no you put that down, please.
Libby, I'm sorry, I can't.
I want to find my son.
Mattys had six years with Angie.
Now, think about it. Six years.
Oh Benjamin, that's a great sandcastle.
If you come back into
his life right now,
it's just gonna cause
more disruption and pain.
Just think about it, Libby.
Please? Think about it?
I just want to see him, Rebecca.
Can you give me an address
for Angie so I can see him?
Look, I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.
Lauren! C'mon, get down please.
That's it.
- Where's Parsons?
- I don't know. Not here.
I got her. Up here!
I got her!
There she is!
Jesus Christ, Libby!
What are you doing here?
Did you have a nice
day at the beach?
You piss me off, Parsons.
Angela Green.
The woman who's got your kid, right?
- Could we not talk, please, Lehman?
- Okay. All right.
-So why'd she skip town?
-She just skipped town...
And with your husband who isn't dead
because you didn't kill him? Bullshit.
Ok, I killed my husband,
I chopped him up into bits
and dropped him piece by piece
in the Pacific. Are you satisfied?
No, no! You were a hell of a lot closer
to your kid 3 days ago than you are today.
All you had to do was wait 3 years.
That's all. You fucking idiot!
You cannot know what is it like
to sit in prison for six years
and to think nothing else
in the world but your son...
Did I make the right choice?
Yes! You asked the wrong question, Lehman!
I didn't have a choice!
Fuck your curfew!
Who's that? Your daughter?
Is that a problem for you, Lehman?
I'm going up top.
Don't go anywhere.
Shit!
Did you voluntarily give her the gun?
C'mon, Carl, what do you
think? Hey! Hey! That's it.
-Were you drinking?
-No I wan't drinking.
Well, it's been known to happen.
-Do you have any idea
where she's gone? -No.
-All right. Well, then I think that's
about all then, isn't it? -So what?
There will be an investigation
into your actions today.
I wouldn't hold my breath about
the prospect of keeping your job.
Carl, give me a break! Back down.
Thanks alot!
I sent your father off to the VFW.
He'll be playing gin for hours.
Some things never change.
Oh, he's not as bad as he
used to be, you know.
I'm glad for you, Momma.
I always said there was
good money in tomatoes.
- So, you're in the market for a BMW?
- Yea! Who isn't?
- Oh, well, they're the best. -I decided it
was finally time to trade up. -Right...
So why don't you check my credit
and see if I can finance this?
Great, let me have your social security
number and I'll get the ball rolling.
20 Oriole Terrace, Evergreen,
Colorado. Is that your current address?
20 Oriole Terrace,
Evergreen, Colorado, sure is.
-Didn't you say your name was Angela
Green? Cuz this says it's Angela Ryder.
-Oh no, I said Ryder.
Angela Ryder.
What about the car?
Ok. Fill this out and come back to me.
- How's tricks, Orbe?
- No way, no way, no way.
- I've been clean, Mr Travis.
- Oh, I know. I believe you. I do.
What I need is a search on
a lady named Angela Green.
I got her social security number
here. I'd like you to, uh...
-Please! You know I'm not allowed
to give out personal information.
-Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
asked you that. I'm sorry. -Uh huh!
Speaking about giving out
personal information:
Does your employer know you used to
perform the art of fellatio for a living,
At the present retired and
that you're out on parole?
You're required by law to tell him.
- You're looking good, Orbe.
- I know.
Honey, can you get that?
Hi.
- Who is it, Sam?
- Oh, some lady.
May I help you?
I'm looking for my friend, Angela Ryder.
I thought this was her address.
I have never heard of her,
but we've just moved in.
Ah, maybe you should check with
the woman who lives next door,
she's been here 40 years.
Excuse me.
Dearie, whatever you're selling,
I'll already got 2 of them.
I'm just looking for my friend Angela
Ryder. She used to live next door.
Oh...I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you, but...
Angie died in the accident.
It was three or four years ago.
It was one of those awful things.
The..uh..the stove..the gas
stove in their house was leaking.
The explosion knocked out
some of my windows. And, uh...
- What about the boy?
- Matty? He's such a dear child.
No, he and Simon weren't there
when it happened. Poor Simon...
I've never seen anyone so grief-stricken.
Oh, I'm sure.
Help me out, kiddo.
It would really help if you could
remember what kind of car she was driving.
-Well, it was an old truck.
-Yea?
It's um, I don't know what
year or make or anything.
What colour was it?
Kandinskys? Hmm, it's a bit
out of our reach, I'm afraid.
I have a few Picasso
and Chagall lithographs.
Hmm, no, it's Kandinsky that
I'm particularly interested in.
Especially the Blue Rider period.
I love that.
Ah, well um, let's check Art Scan.
Kandinskys don't become
available too often, I'm afraid.
- Here's a lovely little Miro...
- It really needs to be Kandinsky.
Kadinsky...yes...
Ah, here is a lovely
1922 Kandinsky lithograph...
- The 1911 is all that interests me.
- 1911...
-Stop! There. Yes!
-What? -Yes, that's it!
No, I'm afraid we've missed that.
It was sold to a museum
in Munich six months ago.
Do you think you could find who sold it?
Perhaps they have more.
Well, why, yes... Yes, let's see.
Will you excuse me a moment...
- Yes sir, can I help you?
-Well, yes.
Uh, my name is Travis Lehman,
And I'm with the Washington State
Department of Corrections...
I was wondering if you...
...Actually, I'm looking for a young lady...
She seemed so refined...
What I'd really like to know is
what that woman wanted in your gallery?
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Jonathan Devereaux.
Oh, Mr. Devereaux's out right now,
but he'll be back tonight, for the party.
- Well, is Matty here?
- I don't believe I know you, ma'am.
Maybe you'd like to leave a message?
It's really a pleasure to have you stay
with us here at the Montzenella, Mrs Kritch.
Thank you. My suite has a view?
Your room has a lovely view
of the Mississippi, Mrs. Kritch.
-And I need a masseur.
-I'll send Jerome right up. Bruce...
1420, Mrs Kritch.
Hello.
I'm sorry, are you lost?
No, actually I'm found.
I just had an hour with Jerome.
Oh, Jerome!... I've
heard that he is marvelous.
He's fabulous. I haven't felt this good
since the day my husband died.
So, I've got something for tonight,
but I think I need Armani.
- Yes, very good, Mrs..?
- Kritch. Suite 1420.
Of course.
I'll be charging it to my room.
Hmm, yeah, Mrs Kritch,
I would say that you are a size four?
- Two.
- Of course.
There's a guy waiting for you.
Did you catch that thing?
What did you use for bait?
I caught that big bucket-mouth sonafabitch
off an old rebel lure my daddy left me.
Of course, buzz-bombs, poppers, jigs, all
kinds of things work back in these waters.
I'm Jim Mangold.
Travis Lehman, Washington
Department of Corrections.
What can I do for you?
Who's this?
- That's somebody I'm looking for.
- Pretty girl.
Oh yeah! She's very pretty...
for a convicted murderer.
She jumped parole on me.
Mr. Lehman, I'd love to
be able to help you, sir...
No, I don't want you guys
to go to any trouble.
I can handle matters.
I just came down as a professional courtesy.
Since she's in New Orleans and she came
here to kill one of your prominent citizens.
And just how she planning on doin' that?
I don't know. She'll probably use
the .38 Special she stole from me.
Roy Lee!
Get these in the works, now!
What a remarkable wrap!
Where on earth did you find that?
Well, the first lady
asked me the same thing,
when we stayed at the White House.
-And I wouldn't tell her, either.
-Invitations? -Oh, I got them right here.
-Enjoy your evening.
-Good evening, ma'am. -Good evening.
Good evening, madams and monsieurs!
We're delighted you're with us this evening
on this very special occasion.
And as is the custom in New Orleans,
since even before the war
of Northern aggression,
we offer the ladies of this
fair city, our first bachelor
who's been placed on the auctioning block.
Our host, Jonathan Devereaux!
Where is that man?
- Hey, Jonathan.
- Thank you, Louis.
You all having a good time?
Fine.
Now then, ladies,
what you see before you
is a moderately presentable man
in his 30's,
given to unhealthy thoughts
and a dissipated lifestyle.
With, and this is what is going
to cost you the really big money...
Absolutely no
redeeming moral virtues.
- 500. - Yeah, well, my cuff links
cost more than that.
-Do I hear 1,000?
-A thousand. -Thank you. Hmmm...
-2,000.
-Ohhhh...!
All right, now judges here: did I just
hear the voice of the charming Miss Monroe?
Because I was just starting to worry.
- I was beginning to think
you didn't care. - 2,500.
2,500. We have a new bidder.
3,000.
5,000.
5,500.
Well, we have 5,500.
Will, uh...will the lady take us to 6?
$10,000 dollars.
You see? At last, someone
who knows my true value.
Now, Miss Monroe, I believe
the bid is to you at $10,500 dollars.
Well you can have him, honey. Believe me,
he ain't worth that much.
I know from personal experience...
Thank you, honey.
All right, going once...
going twice... sold!
The woman in the back.
$10,000.
Would you like to come forward
and claim your prize, young lady?
Hello, Nick.
Well, aren't you going to give me a kiss?
I think I've earned it.
Ooooohhhh!
I'll make this real easy for you, Nick.
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse.
-You used to love a good deal, didn't you?
-Can we just take this some place private?
I don't think so, I remember what
happened the last time we were alone.
I don't believe we've met,
I'm Suzanne Monroe.
I'm Libby, I'm his wife.
Well, Jonathan! A minute ago
a bachelor, now you're married.
You don't waste any time.
You been in New Orleans long?
-She's uh... -I'm just passing through town,
to pick up my child.
-I'll be leaving very soon.
-How nice!
We're finally putting the past behind us.
-And moving on with our lives,
aren't we... Jonathan? -Sure.
I do have one question though.
How long were Angie and you fucking
before you decided to get rid of me?
- Would you excuse us, please?
- Oh yeah, sure. Go ahead.
-Where is he, Nick?
-Libby... -You destroyed my life,
and I will destroy yours, unless you
give me Matty. That's all I want.
Listen, let me explain
something to you.
You have to understand something.
We were going under.
We were going to lose everything.
And If I had any guts, I would have
killed myself. But I was trying
to protect you. That's why
I got the life insurance.
So I'd be out of the picture,
and you and Matty would be okay.
And I just never believed
they would convict you.
They did, Nick.
And the thing with Angie happened later.
It was,...it was a nightmare.
And the worst part of it
was being away from you.
So is that why you killed her?
That was an accident.
Nice try, Nick, I'm not buying.
It's bullshit.
-I will swear on the life of our son...
-Oh don't you fucking dare.
You can keep your hotel, your fancy accent
and your new name. Just give me Matty.
-Ok, I understand...
- No, now! Give him to me now!
It's in the middle of the night.
-I can't, I just can't walk away from here.
-Do you think I'm stupid?
No, I don't think you're stupid.
I won't let you slip away once again.
It's too far to Matty's school.
And you gotta be patient.
I've been patient for six...years.
I want my child.
I'll call you tomorrow, Nick.
No screwing around.
- Uh, excuse me. Do you know where
Mr Devereaux is? - He's at the bar, sir.
-Over here? -Yes.
-Thank you.
I'm sorry. Oh thank you, Marcel.
Can I offer you a drink?
Oh no, no thank you.
Let me guess.
I take you for a Scotch and soda, huh?
What? Well...uh,uh,
I'll have a diet Coke, please. Thank you.
Well all right but I bet
you used to drink,
and now you're on the wagon.
$10 says I'm right.
You're sure you've never
seen this woman before?
-No, I'm positive.
-Oh, okay.
-Now lemme get it straight though,
she believes that I'm her husband, -Oh yea!
whom she killed?
-Yes, sir.
- That's pretty far-fetched.
-Uh, far-fetched or not,
she is in New Orleans, she does
have a gun, she is looking for you.
Well, thank you, but I'll
alert our security people.
You do that.
The cops have been passing these out.
No reward. Screw 'em.
They're gonna be posted
in every hotel in town.
So much for a good night's sleep.
Take this.
Get out of here.
Thanks a lot.
Let's go, Lehman.
We've spotted your girl.
Where'd she go, Dilbert?
-Hey! -I'm sorry!
-What do you think you're doing?
No, I'm very sorry, m'am.
I thought you were somebody else.
It was a case of mistaken identity. I'm...
- Have a good evening.
- I take it that ain't her?
-Mr. Lehman... come in.
-Thank you.
- May I offer you a Cuban cigar?
- Oh no, thanks.
-Well, as you can see,
I'm alive and kicking. -Yeah...
So what can I do for
you this morning?
We spotted the Parsons woman
in 'The Quarter' last night.
She got away. I just came by
to find out if you'd heard from her.
Not a peep.
- Do you have any idea why
she's fixated her lunacy on you?
Well, the world's full of
crazy people, am I right?
Oh yes, you are right.
Truer words were never spoken.
Those are nice pictures there.
Did your kids do 'em?
Uh, no... Those pictures are by a very
great artist named Kandinsky.
Oh.
But why do I think you
already knew that?
Excuse me for a second.
Yes?
- This is a business call.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I hope you'll excuse me.
Now you let yourself out that
back door. It leads down to the kitchen.
-Yeah, get the chef to fix you a
fabulous New Orleans breakfast. -Nice!
-You see? I recommend the eggs St. Jacques.
-Oh boy, that sounds good. -Hmm-hmm.
-I have your card.
-Ok!
Morning, darling.
I hope you had a nice night.
I want you to bring Matty to
Lafayette Cemetery number 3.
A cemetary? That's
uh, that's an odd choice for a reunion.
It's a big tourist place, Nick.
Lot of people around.
You're a smart girl.
I can have him there by four.
- Where's Matty?
- Relax. He's nervous.
So I told him he could go play inside.
There he is.
Matty, come over here, son.
- Oh, Matty. Oh, ok, I'll get him for you.
- No! No...
It's something I want to do.
Matty?
Matty?
Hey, kiddo...
Hey, Matty...
Matty...
Matty, it's Mommy.
Officially, man, you're just
going to have to learn to relax, son.
Why do you get your panties in
such a twist about, anyhow?
You ever arrest anybody
you thought was innocent, Mangold?
Nope.
Of course, there's no information on
Jonathan Devereaux that's over 3 years old.
3 years ago the guy didn't even exist!
So he changed his name.
Lots of folks change their name, Lehman.
That don't make them criminal.
Yeah, but I'm betting he's
changing it from Simon Ryder.
And before that
it was Nick Parsons.
-But you can't prove it.
-No.
- Hey, is that long distance?
- Bill me.
Lucy, hi! This is Travis.
Listen, I want you to get the DMV to
fax me a Washington driver's license
photograph of one Nicholas Parsons.
I'm at the New Orleans police department...
Travis, you better talk to Mr Carruthers.
His colon is twisted in a knot!
Gimme that! I've had to cover
your office for you, Travis.
Where the hell are you?
Listen to me Carl, I think that this Parsons
woman has been telling the truth.
You're not a law professor anymore, Travis.
You're barely even a parole officer.
So stop playing Mission lmpossible and...
All I need is a DMV diver's license
photograph of Nicholas Parsons.
You get back here, today. Because tomorrow
you're going in front of the Commissioner.
Carl, I know I'm right.
You give me a chance, okay?
I'm asking you politely.
You send me that goddamn picture!
It's not him.
See Lehman, the thing is, every now and
again we all want to believe in something.
Now we just keep forgettting that 99.9%
of the time, life just flat don't work out.
Well, I hadn't thought about that Mangold.
Thanks, I feel a lot better now.
Any time, officer. Anytime.
Hold it right here.
It's over, Libby.
Oh, Travis...
Messages.
Thank you.
- Mr. Devereaux?
- Mr. Lehman...
- I'm sorry, this is really not a good time.
- I understand.
You know a lot of people feel that way
about me, but I have good news.
Won't take long.
Well?
Well, turns out I owe you an apology,
Mr. Devereaux.
After our last conversation,
I started thinking maybe that
Parsons woman is telling the
truth about who you used to be.
So I asked the Washington State
Department of Motor Vehicles to send me
a driver's license photograph
of Nicholas Parsons.
- And?
- And this is what came up.
Well, we all make mistakes.
I mean, there's no harm done.
Then I thought about it some more,
and it occurred to me what
a common name Nicholas Parsons is.
You know, it turns out there were six.
And this...
...is number three.
I never liked that picture.
So, Mr. Lehman, you came
here to make a deal.
Otherwise I guess you would have
gone straight to the police. So...
...the question is: what's your price?
A million dollars.
It's a nice, round figure, right?
Uh...
All right. But you gonna have
to give me a couple of days.
No. I want one million dollars right now.
Mr. Lehman, it's nine o'clock at night.
I can't just...
Wait a minute. Wait!
I have $100,000 in the safe here.
And you can have that now.
And I'll get you the rest tomorrow.
You got a deal!
We do have one other problem
and that's Mrs. Parsons.
She can still make a lot of
trouble for us, even from prison.
-I really don't need that.
-Well, I think I've solved that problem.
What do you mean?
Let's just say the problem has been buried.
-Really?
-She's gone, I promise you.
You're not very good
at keeping promises, Nick.
-You going to do something?
-What are you talking to me for?
She's the one with the gun.
They're tough in Louisiana, Libby.
You shoot me, they'll give
you the gas chamber.
No, they won't. It's called
'Double Jeopardy'.
I learned a few things in prison, Nick.
I could shoot you in the middle of
Mardis Gras and they can't touch me.
As an ex-law professor,
I can assure you she is right!
Where's my son?
In St Alban's School, in Georgia, all right?
You have your son back,
you got what you want.
I haven't felt that good in six years.
I don't want to kill you, Nick.
I just want you to suffer like I suffered.
But what she means, Nick, is,
you're going to prison. For murder.
- Who did I supposedly murder?
- Me!
-All you have is an old fax photo.
-Which supplies the motive!
Your wife, whom you had framed,
tracks you down,
and to keep her from exposing
you, you kill her.
You won't get away with it.
-Well, I think I've solved that problem.
-What do you mean?
-Let's just say the problem
has been buried. -Really?
She's gone, l promise you.
Taped confessions are very
persuasive in court, Nick.
And of course, there is the
physical evidence
that we're going to put
in the trunk of your car.
A shovel, hair, my fingerprints,
a little blood...
And now don't forget the gasoline...
And it'll look like you burned and buried
my body, just like you say on the tape.
The prosecution rests.
You better get out of here.
Nobody wants a dead woman walking around
when the police are trying to
arrest a guy for her murder.
Wait a minute. I'll take that gun.
- Well, Lehman, you gonna live?
- I doubt it.
Mrs. Parsons? Since you are
still legally his wife, I suspect
you just inherited yourself
a right fine little hotel here.
Not interested.
-I guess I'm gonna take off now.
-No. No, you're not.
You're a parole violator,
you're in my custody.
You're going with me to Seattle...
where I will demand a full pardon...
and a parade...
and a little pink poodle...
on a key-chain.
What are you waiting for?
Go on.
I don't know if I've ever been
so scared in my whole life.
I think a big part of me
never thought I'd really find him.
What if he doesn't recognise me?
I mean, maybe after all...
Damn, woman! Because of you
I have lost a perfectly good
used car and a not-so-good job.
If you don't go to this kid right now,
I'm gonna have you arrested...
for stupidity.
Now go on!
Thanks, Lehman.
You saved my life.
You saved mine, too.
- Coach Matthews. How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.
It'll be half-time soon.
Matty...
Matty.
Hi.
Do you know who I am?
- They told me you were dead.
- No, sweetheart.
