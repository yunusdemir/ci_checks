Damn! The chicken is gone!
Get her, mister!
If the picture is good
I will work in a newspaper.
You are playing with your life
for a photrograph?
Do you think that I am in the mood
to see the fucking gang?
The chicken bro!
The chicken I told you, asshole!
Get the chicken!
If Ze gets you,
you're dead.
He has to find me first.
Hey, kid! Get the chicken!
-The cops!
-Don't run!
Butthead! Mothefucker!
A photo might
have changed my life...
but in the City of God,
if you run you're dead...
... if you stay,
you're dead again.
It has always been like that
since I was a kid.
IN THE 60's
-You are so useless.
-Fetch the ball.
Hey, kid! Fetch the ball.
you are not giving it to me?
Fuck you.
What's your name?
Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.
My name is Rocket.
Do not give the ball
to the kid, he stinks.
This is Hairy.
The story of the City of God
starts with him.
However, Hairy's story
is connected to Mortes Trio story.
The truck is comming.
Why are you fooling around?
TRIO MORTES STORY
Trio Mortes
the legend of the City of God!
Hairy.
Snatcher.
And Naive.
With them, Kid and
Benny, Hairy's brother.
I did not have enough courage
to go with my brother.
Come Naive!
Let's go!
Stop or I'll shoot,
fucking asshole.
Get out!
Quickly, asshole.
Give me the money!
Who wants gass?
Oh! You wanna die for money
that is not yours?
Lots of money here!
Damn! The cops!
Quickly!
They are everywhere!
Then, I thought that
Trio Mortes...
was the toughest gang
in Rio.
But they were just amateurs.
Even my bro
Naive.
Give these to dad
but do not tell him it's from me.
Hairy, come and see what I've got!
We came to the City of God
to find paradise.
Lot of people were homeless
due to the floods...
and the fire
they set on ghetto.
They are going to bring electricity!
The big bosses however
didn't like the homeless.
Without electricity, without
roads, without busses.
The rich people. . .
They don't give a damn about us
It has nothing to do
with the Rio De Janeiro you see in postcards.
Do you think I am going to be
a lifeguard when I grow up?
I don't know.
It is better to be a
lifeguard than a fisherman.
I don't want to be a fisherman,
I will stink.
-Are you insulting your father?
-No.
-What do you want to become?
I sure don't want to be a gangster
or a cop.
I do not want to get killed.
Drop it, Kid.
Are you pointing a gun at me?
The kid is with me.
I am a gangster too.
-Not many bottles in it.
-We rob trucks every day.
We have to hit a rich
house to get out of here.
No, you have to
follow my plan.
Look who's talking!
He is so stoned, he
doesn't know what he is talking about!
You are both not as
worthy as the kid.
What are you thinking, Kid?
The gun doesn't make you a robber.
You need ideas.
The kid had ideas.
Is this the Motel?
We get the money and leave.
No killings!
-Give it to me.
-Leave me alone!
Don't you give this
shit to me!
You're acting like a baby.
-Here's yours.
-Awesome!
Do not be hasty. You're staying here
to look out.
If you see cops,
shoot that window.
Why doesn't he stay in the look-out?
This was my plan.
He is good for nothing!
Ok, you had the idea.
But you're just a kid!
Cover us.
Your turn is going to come.
Don't be so hasty.
Stay here.
This is a hold up, bitch.
You should be at school
or at work.
You do not look like robbers.
Shut up, bitch!
Ok, Snatcher?
Are we going in?
-I did not order anything.
-It's on the house! Your money!
Take it easy. All I want is your money.
Hey, pal!
What is this mess?
Are you a church boy?
Give it to me!
You are old, and ugly.
Do you want to fuck her?
Police! Let's beat it!
Take the car.
I'm gonna bring the kid.
-It went wrong. The kid is missing!
-They are shooting, let's go!
-You said you could drive.
-I can, cool down.
Turn! Watch it!
-You asshole!
-I didn't do it on purpose.
No one saw a thing.
Don't say a word, ok?
I twisted my leg!
-Naive is hit!
-It hurts!
Take him to the woods.
I will try to distract the cops.
God help us.
Get the phone.
Shortie. Infamous in the City.
I will talk about him later.
It hurts, God damnit!
Shut up!
You're acting like a sissy.
Give me your hand!
A whole car runs
into a bar...
and no one saw a thing?
As always. No one sees
no one knows a thing.
-What's up, Shortie?
-They are hiding in the woods.
I think they
are hiding in the woods.
They are in the woods.
Fillipe, lock the car.
Rantzel, come with me.
Pitch black.
How do they see?
They stole a fortune
from the motel...
-What if we took the money?
-Are you out of your mind?
I do not want any trouble.
I just want to eliminate them.
Since when is it a crime
to steal from niggers and robbers?
I know a snitch in the City.
Did you hear the shootings?
If I find one of them, I will shoot him!
Maracana!
Open the door!
They are after me!
The police is after me!
Hide me!
Come inside.
Shit, the cops
still down there.
-I had a vision, Naive.
-Did you smoke anything?
you had a job, right?
How is it? What do they say to you?
I worked for my father.
Fathers say bullshit.
I'm leaving. I do not want to die.
I am not ment to be a gangster.
-The cops are down there.
-I don't care.
I am going back to the church.
"I am the resurrection
and the life..
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live..
And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me..
shall never die..."
Stop, or I'll shoot!
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.."
The robbery in the motel
was the most bloodstained in history.
The gangsters fortunes
changed paths.
He must not have
been a gangster.
He is a worker.
snatcher was
in God's hands.
Hairy was caught
in the net of Bernice.
and Naive was
in my father's hands.
Why are you doing this?
You will be wotking with me!
Your brother is
going to look after you.
If I ever catch you with money
that is not yours, I'll kill you!
This goes for you too.
Put on the work wear!
If your brother is a gangster
you are affected as well!
Don't worry.
He will get over it.
These things are not for you!
You go and study.
Aren't you affraid of being killed?
you are smart,
you have to go to college.
I attend school beacuse
I do not like working.
Promise me that you are
never gonna touch this weapon.
Quickly. I will sell
lots of fish. Do not laugh!
You smiled when father
hit me.
What's wrong?
Cat got your tongue?
I'm thinking how to tell you.
You're gonna fry your brain
if you think so much.
My heart chose you.
I am listening to my heart.
Are you kidding?
Have you never head
of love at first sight?
-Gangsters do not love.
-You always talk to me in a bad way.
-Gangsters seduce.
-I am not going to lose my peace.
Gangsters do not stop
just take a break.
-You know nothing of love.
-This is no love it is a joke.
I love you.
You might convince me
in the end.
After the robbery, police
did raids in the ghetto.
Everyday, someone was sent to jail,
someone was sold out.
But no one ever knew anything.
No one revealed the
robbers hideout.
THREE MONTHS LATER
Why don't you change
life, Hairy?
Find a job instead of
lying in bed all day!
Do you think that a job will
give you money? Go try!
What do you think
I am doing all day long?
Take it easy, baby.
All I want is you.
to have children, a farm
with chicken, and lots of weed.
I do not believe a word.
I almost got rich
with that robbery.
Police is after you
after the motel killings.
What are you saying? Did you see anything?
So shut up!
They shot them,
and blamed it to me!
They even killed
Kid! So leave it!
-I don't know who did it
-Not me.
I do not a gangster as
the father of my children!
You are alone, Hairy!
Snatcher became religious,
Naive found a job.
-And you?
-I am the same!
-Everybody dumped me.
-Then I will dump you too.
I am leaving. If you want, come with
me, else I will leave alone!
Nice fresh fish!!
My brother promised
to conform.
But the gangster does not change.
Just stops for a while.
Naive was having an affair
with Shortie's wife.
I have trout, but for you
I have something special.
It's a mullet.
Does your husband lick you?
Mine, before fucking
he licks me for half an hour.
-From behind?  Do you let him?
-No!  Doesn't it hurt?
In the begining, yes. After that it
is perfect! But you need a banana.
-Why?
-You're losing the best part kid!
You warm up a banana
and stick it in your pussy!
while he fucks you in the ass.
It is awesome!
-Ask your husband.
-I can't. he will get mad
Try. Men go nuts
for stuff like that.
Fucking nigger!
Bitch!
Whore!
rocket, give me your
shorts, quickly!
-I am not gonna get naked in the street.
-Your brother is in danger!
Give me the shirt!
Quickly!
I always pay the price.
He run away.
It's his brother.
I will cut his balls!
Fish! Fresh fish!
Kid, come here.
-Where is your brother?
-Not working today.
-Get in.
-I did nothing.
-What about my fish
-Get in. Forget fish.
My father will
kill me.
Let's go. There is nothing here.
My father sweared not
to see my brother again.
No one saw him again
in the ghetto.
Trio Mortes story
reached its end.
Kid! I though you were killed
in the motel.
-I can see you got money.
-It's ours, Benny.
Cut the crap
and bring the money.
Tell Hairy that
Shortie is getting hard. I'm leaving
But, Shortie was busy
A neighbour call the cops
before sunrise.
The newpapers wrote:
''A husband burries his wife
alive in the City of God''
The place was full of cops.
The robbers run away.
-Do you want to die?
-Do as I tell you.
Some respect to the lady.
-Let's go.
-There are cops ahead.
Fuck them, go away.
Go wherever you want.
What is up?
Mercy. It is a piece of crap.
-Start the engine!
-Needs pushing.
Push, Hairy.
Push!
You?
Do you want to arrest
the thieves? There..
Get him!
Run, Hairy!
Stop!
He's a murderer!
The day that Hairy
was killed...
I remember the crowd
and a camera.
I always wanted a camera.
Let's go to scholl.
-Why don't we go to the beach?
-We have exams!
So what!
Everybody is in the beach!
She wears bikini
and plays hard to get!
Sun is for everyone.
Beach for a few.
IN THE 70's
When I was 16 I bought
my first camera.
Starting from the low.
The cheapest model!
How is it going, Rocket?
Have you been laid yet?
Nothing.
Angelica. She drove me mad..
Rocket, are you jerking?
Gorgeus and got laid.
I wanted to lose my virginity with her!
-She has a boyfriend.
-So?  I am not jealous
-Her father is a cop.
-No one is perfect.
I was the official photographer
of the gang.
of "Groovie Gang".
Everybody paid for copies.
Siago, move backwards.
There.
I need a joint.
Sniff coke.
It is great!
Siago do u sniff?
I prefer a good pot.
-I can find for you if you want.
-Go find then.
If we talk about dope
we talk about coke!
Drugs!
-you're full of salt.
-Fuck off.
you want to be a lifeguard
but you never go inside.
I bet a beer i
am a better swimmer.
If you want I can find a joint
at Blackies.
I would do anything for her.
I would find pot, coke...
I would go to the big ones
to buy good stuff..
the boss was an ex
classmate: Blackie.
-Who?
-Rocket!
Who are things going?
The kids ok?
Do you want to buy
or smoke?
Who is it?
This was Blackies hideout
But not since ever.
Fuck off Kid
Why are u marching in like that?
Is this your hideout?
THE STORY OF THE HIDEOUT
Donan Zel after becoming a widow
she started to sell drugs..
to feed her children.
She often gace out dope
to the kids with exchange.
Her favourite was
the Big Guy.
She was such an amateur
that even Big Guy was cheating on her.
Big Guy was using kids
as dealers.
-My pot?
-Stick it in your ass.
The best dealer..
was Redhead.
May I have a sip?
Big Guy trusted him
and so he became a manager.
twenty for us
five for you, Blackie.
some day a friend of Redhead appeared.
Aristotle.
My wife is sick.
His family had helped
Redhead.
He would not refuse help
to a brother.
The dope. I want the money
till Friday.
You put me out of jail.
He is a friend, Big Guy.
Give him another week.
You either kill him or I'll kill you.
He had no choice.
-I told you on Friday.
-Do not do it friend.
Redhead wanted to get
the Big Guy..
but he did not have to.
Big Guy died in jail.
Redhead took the
belongings of Big Guy..
but not the hideout.
It was cursed.
He gave it to his trustee
Blakie.
-hundred fifty bags.
-Not enough.
So he took over
the local dealing.
But not for long.
Who is it?
Go see.
Fuck off kid. Why are
you rushing into my hideout?
Who told you
it is yours?
And I am not kid.
My name is Ze.
THE STORY OF LITTLE ZE
Ze wanted to rule
the City of God..
since he was a kid.
They are having fun and I am not?
I want to go.
What do you want?
Your friend took it all.
That night, Kid
satisfied his thirst for blood.
knowing that Hairy
would never forgive him.
To save himself
he left the City of God.
He worked all day for nickels.
Kid and Benny
really made it..
they had the gift of the killer.
-You have more.
-I had the idea.
the problem was to handle
an older gangster.
like my brother Goose.
Damnit! I though you died in the motel
You have lots of money!
It is our money, Benny.
Benny, tell Hairy that
Shortie is getting hard.
I'm leaving the ghetto.
From Hairy.
You are gonna need it.
robbery after robbery
the Kid grew big.
In his 18s he was the
most respected gangster in the City
One of the most
dangerous robbers in Rio.
Happy birthday Kid.
Glad you turned 18.
Beat it!
-Just a beer!
-Didn't you see me asshole?
Next time, I will kill
you prick!
Kid was ready for everything!
And couldn't wait.
Whos is the wealthiest here?
Lots.
Jerry Andriani..
golden necklace, luxurious clothes.
-Perriera and the chick.
-My brother took her.
Look at the race.
Here is Blackie.
Full of gold.
Redhead. Nice wheels!
All of the dealers.
-All of them wealthy.
-Robberies and shit.
the big money
is in drug dealing.
-Especialy coke.
-Needs capital though.
We will kill them
and take over.
-When do we start
-Now.
The light of Satan
brought you here!
Why do you live in the City of God
that God has forgotten?
I know what you want.
you want power.
I have something that will give
you the power you're looking for.
that will change tour fate.
I give you my amullet.
Just do not fuck
while you wear it..
because you will die!
The kid will no longer be Kid
but Ze.
Little Ze grew up.
If you help me
I will help you.
this way Kid became Ze
and started the killings.
One morning
he took over Andriani's gang..
till the night, he ruled
all the ghetto gangs.
He did not harm Redhead
since he was Bennie's friens.
Only the hideout was left.
but it was an easy job.
Who is it?
Fuck off kid. Why are you
rushing into my hideout?
Since when is it your hideout?
Anything wrong Kid?
I am not Kid.
My name is Ze!
-You're dead bastard.
-No, he understands.
All yours I want nothing
I do not want trouble.
I had to take vegeance
on my brother's death.
you are gonna live
but you will work for us.
Easy to say.
-Where are you going?
-He's clean Ze.
-Waht is your name?
-Rocket
Naive's brother.
Dead Naive's brother.
Go and tell everyone
that Ze is now in charge.
We are selling coke.
Got it?
Drug dealing is a job too!
the supplier brings the merchantise
which is packed.
All is a chain.
Pot is wrapped.
coke is packed in 10s or 100s.
You can be a
carrierist drug dealer.
The kids start as messengers.
Then they do lookouts.
If the cops come
they all vanish.
Then you become a dealer.
In hard times
the dealer vanishes.
Growing up,
you become captain.
And if you are good in
math, you become a manager.
Bosses right hand.
The cops get their cut
and stay out of it.
Whan ze came,
all the rivals stopped in the City.
You could go there.
Bohemian people bought
their dope safely.
Lots of people became addicts
and Ze became rich.
-Which one should I wear?
-This is cool.
If drug dealing was legal
Ze would be given an Oscar.
I thought that all these
are very dangerous.
However he was everywhere.
If I needed pot
I had to visit Redhead.
-Half a pound.
-Thanks.
It was woth it.
I smoked it with Angelica.
She had broken up with Siago
and so I made my move.
Fantastic photos.
Do I look good here?
You look good in all of them.
Twilight, an empty beach,
a long-lasting kiss..
That was it...
But the Shorties came...
Will you give me a splif?
Here.
See you later.
-Your joint!
-Keep it!
First time I met
the Shorties.
Steak and potatoes.
-This is for you.
-All of it? Thanks.
Do you want to have something to eat?
Can you change the time in the clock please?
After he broke up, Siago
sniffed more and more everyday.
When you become an addict,
you're in the dealer's hands.
-Two bags of ten.
-One bag.
For Siago it waa not like that.
-Sorry, godfather.
-Bullshit, did I baptize you?
Give me your bike,
Blackie.
Do you wanna race?
Till the bus.
Ready? Go!
-Hard race.
-You're good.
-Where did you buy the triners from?
-From the neighborhood.
-And the shirt?
-From the City.
It is an expensive brand.
If I give you the money
will you buy me one?
Shorts and shirt?
Buy whatever you can.
-What is your size?
-Measure me!
-With what?
-With you!
Shoe number?
Turn around.
Benny! Did you get the goodies?
-Just a pair of trousers?
-There is more.
Do you like it?
-You have some change.
-Keep it.
This is Benny.
I became bohemian.
Gangsters, listen.
Beware...
Groovies are making moves
before the big boom.
Fuck you, bastards!
Prick!
Redhead is placing
the ghetto in danger.
Go talk to him. You can't
just shoot everybody.
Don't worry,
the lads here are ok.
I don't worry!
Will you dance, Benny? What
happened with the Redhead?
Go talk to him!
Benny was the coolest
gangster in the City.
He gave away dope,
paid for his drinks.
Ze was the opposite.
He was obsessed.
Wanted to become the big ghetto boss.
He was looking for the opportunity
to take over Redhead's gang.
Don't let the Shorties
rob the whole ghetto.
You mind your business
and I will mind mine.
I'm going for a drink.
How is it going Rocket?
Siago, what's up?
Want to dance?
Can we go to your place?
My parents are not home.
You're gonna be alone.
Today you can
lose your virginity!
Don't shout!
Everyone will hear!
You're pretty.
It's ok.
I know you are related to
the Shorties.
Do you think I am stupid?
You want my gang?
I just want to talk to you.
You are useless!
The Shorties
are endagering us.
Ask them to cool down.
He lets them plunder
in his ghetto, the useless.
If police come here
we're fucked.
I will do it because I like you.
Change his dipers!
Tell him that no one
plunders in my ghetto!
Shorties do not respect
the ghetto rules.
They steal from ordinary people
and rob bakeries.
You're stealing from me all the time!
However, they didn't know
the city had a new boss!
THANK YOU
FOR PREFERING US
The city has become safer
fot the inhabitants.
Robberies are rare.
All you have to do is visit Ze.
-Do not touch Shorties
-I don't.
-Let's go for a walk
-Together?
Mom, I am going out
with my friends.
I have never tasted a better chicken!
-The old man was scared to death!
-you feel sorry for him?
Should we rob a bank
or a supermarket?
Bullshit. All the money
is in drug dealing.
You have to start as
a messenger.
It is no good. Takes too
much time to be promoted.
You have to wait for
an old guy to get killed.
I won't wait for anyone to
bite the dust. I'll do as Ze.
Are you talking about me kid?
The boss is here.
Come back, you tramp!
They run fast!
Anyone else?
You're gonna pay for
the ones who run away.
shall I shoot you
in the arm or the leg?
-Choose.
-Hand or leg?
Choose, damnit!
-In the hand.
-In the hand eh?
Let's see about you.
Kill one of them.
-I'll do it!
-Beat it! He's gonna do it.
Pick whom you'll kill.
-We don't have all day.
-Kill one of them.
Get over with it, Steak.
I want to see if you have the guts.
Well done! You did it!
You're one of us. Gimme five.
Get up, tramp.
Go back to your shithole.
Stop limping!
Tell your friends
no one steals from Ze.
While Ze was earning the
respect of the locals..
Benny was winning
Angelica's heart.
I was still a virgin and broke
I had no other choice.
THE LIFE OF A SUCKER
I found a job
in a supermarket.
I was working for just a few nickels.
I wanted to be fired..
to buy a camera
with the compensation.
But the my fate
was different.
The guy from the beach!
Do you still smoke?
Kid!
Pull your shirt.
Is this a thank you?
-My compensation?
-Which compensation?
The fucking manager
thought I participated.
You are fired
because of duty violation. Beat it!
I did not get a dime.
A message from God.
''Honesty is
punished, sucker.''
FLIRTING WITH CRIME
The bus is late.
I should have been at work.
-Hide the gun! Are you mad?
-It's broken.
-It is not our fault.
-It is never anyone's fault!
But we pay the price.
Goodnight, lady.
I know him.  He lives
in the City. He will recognise us.
It is his boss'es
money. He doesn't care!
Aren't you
From the City of God?
Only one shall pay.
Study, only this way
you can leave the ghetto.
-Do you study?
-I attended school and then I joined the army.
I was a good shot.
Then, I found this job.
I have knowledge of karate. If I find a job
elsewhere I will leave the ghetto.
Do you wrestle?
I am peacefull.
But if I have to. .
And he was going to have to. But I
will talk about Knockout later.
We are leaving. Bye.
-I couldn't, he was cool.
-He is Gerson's brother.
Let's go home.
There is only a bakery here.
-What are you going to say?
-I don't know! ''Robbery!''
-My phone.
-Prefer soul or groovie?
Nothing again. The girl
was very sexy. She flirted with me.
I couldn't pull the gun,
she was so sweet.
I am lost. How do
I get to Bara?
"The guy from Sao Paolo
was unlucky", I thought.
That's where we are going too.
You are saving me.
Everybody from
Sao Paolo is a nasty pice of work.
We found the body, officer!
Not a pretty sight eh?
Awesome singer.
I like music. Do you?
You like pot too?
Never tried.
I thought so.
-Do you have paper?
-I have some.
I was a professor in rolling joints.
If only I was like that
with girls!
I would not be a virgin still.
For a guy from Sao Paolo
you're cool.
What did they kill her with?
With a bat or a rock.
-The kid.
-they did not hurt it.
-How long ago?
-About four hours.
Shall we take it?
The murder must
be from the City of God.
Motherfucker!
You should have killed her in the
ghetto! Cops are coming!
It was a mater of honor.
Her parents gave me away.
The place is full of cops
because of you! Asshole!
You punished him enough, Ze.
Whoever kills in my
ghetto, dies.
He had issues, Ze.
Leave the ghetto.
You showed disrespect!
The snake will bite you,
Benny.
-He was useless.
-A dirty traitor.
I am going for a walk with the girl.
Take care. When
things calm down..
we will deal with
Redhead again.
Get a girlfriend, Ze.
-Do you know what I am thinking?
-That I am sexy?
That too. Do you know
what we can do?
-Love?
-I am serious.
Get out of here.
I hate violence.
-And go where?
-To a farm.
We are hippies at heart.
To a farm?
Peace and love?
BENNY'S FAREWELL
Benny was too cool
to be a gangster.
With his party he managed
to bring everyone together.
Gangs..
soul fans..
religious people..
Some day I'll go to the church.
Samba fans..
Groovies..
And Ze
who danced for the first time in his life.
Wanna dance?
-I can't hear you.
-Are you dancing?
Thanks, I got company.
I want to talk to you.
You are not going away
with that chick.
I'll live in a farm,
I'll smoke pot, and listen to rock.
Are you going to ruin everything
for a bitch?
She's my girl.
I will kill
Redhead, the bastard.
You think that everybody is a bastad
that is why I leave!
I am your friend but I am leaving.
Try to understand.
I love you but that's all.
Show me your balls man!
You wanna die? Beat it!
Put your pants down nigger!
I wanna see your ass!
Come on you faggot!
Show us your ass!
Put them down!
The camera
for a bag of coke?
-No more shit.
-You're my friend.
-Is it stolen?
-My father's.
-Give it to Ze.
-Rocket will probably want it.
Here I am!
You want to be a photographer?
Here's a present.
Awesome!
Shake your ass!
You're gona shoot
fine photos.
Bring it here.
-Give me the camera!
-No.
They killed Benny!
Call an ambulance!
Who the fuck did it?
Ze, Benny is dead.
It's your fault bitch!
-Where is Redhead?
-Blackie came.
I'll fuck her.
-Why?
-We're both fucked.
I think I killed
Benny.
Ze is coming. We can
catch up with him in the disco.
-Did you kill Benny?
-Accidentaly. I aimed at Ze.
Blackie. You killed the collest
gangster in the City.
Without Benny, Redhead
was dead.
We're fucked, man.
Where else could a miracle happen
if not in the City of God?
Hallo dall.
Gimme a kiss.
Let me pass.
Have you ever seen your face?
All's well baby?
It was simple as that.
Ze was ugly.
Knockout Nend
was handsome.
Knockout had whoever he wanted.
Ze had to use violence.
a duel between the good
and charming..
and the bad and ugly.
Let go me!
Enjoy it.
No need to resist.
you are mine now.
Your girlfriend
is hot, lucky bastard.
I cannot even look at her.
Why didn't the motherfucker
kill me?
Why didn't I kill
the asshole?
-Let's go back.
-And Redhead?
-We'll be back.
-Are you going to kill him?
Knockout, get out:)
Take it easy.
I am going out. Let me go.
Gerson, come back!
None of your business kid.
It is your brother we want!
My brother is peaceful!
Is he too pretty
to talk to me? Tell him to come out!
He did nothing.
Do you know who I am?
I'm Ze!
Bring the mother fucker!
Cool down, I'll bring him.
I'm hit. Redhead will be
waiting. He asked for it.
The bastard
killed my brother!
I won't let it go.
Need a gun?
-My child!
-Take it easy mom.
-Do it right.
-There is no other way.
-How could he hit me?
-That's a bad hole.
We were like brothers.
You were hit by one brother
me by the other!
Knockout isn't bad.
He came out of nowhere.
You give me a headache, Tuba!
The City of God
found its hero.
God bless you.
The kid went looking for trouble.
You did a fine job.
You have to hide.
I though Knockout would start
a revolution here.
But God had
other plans.
Steak, where did the
dealers disappear?
They are hiding.
Ze is not in a good mood.
They put us in it
and then hide.
-bring me a chocolate.
-I'll try.
Tell her that
Siago is looking for her.
Steak, go tell Redhead...
that Ze says if you kill Knockout
he'll leave you alone.
-Did you hear this Knockout?
-Get the kid!
If you don't stay with us,
you're dead.
Come with us.
We'll be partners.
I do not like drugs.
It's between me and him.
They are scum. They'd do
anything for power.
Like the Kid here
They are all like robots.
Do you have shit inside your head?
Don't you understand that you are
wasted with this maniac?
You are kiddo!
Kid, huh? I sniff, I steal
I kill. I am a man!
He is stuck to his gang. Come with us.
We will slice you, Steak.
Ok, I accept.
Tell him that Redhead and Knockout
are in charge.
With one condition:
I don't kill innocents.
-I won't tolerate it.
-OK, no innocents.
Steak is fucked up.
-Have you got a gun?
-We'll rob a gun store.
I don't rob anything.
I am not a gangster.
I have something personal with him
He raped yous girl,
he killed your brother...
he hit your house and you
killed a acolyte of his.
Unless you are a robber,
get out.
KNOCKOUT NED'S HISTORY
Robbery!
The first time...
Bring the revolvers!
...Knockout Ned saved
a dealer from Redhead.
We said no killings.
It's a rule!
We want boss'money! Open the fund!
Do you want to leave? We also want it.
The second time, Redhead
saved Knockout
Ned learned that rules
have exceptions.
An exception.
Are you the director?
Robbery! Everybody down!
I don't play. Whoever moves
will be shot!
The third time,
the exception became a rule.
With the money from the robberies
they would face Ze.
Redhead would protect his bussines.
Knockout, the best
shooter, wanted revenge.
The Italian first.
This is 9mm.
-It's not aligned.
-You'll get it at a good price.
This is a 12mm.
We call it ''crap''.
Uzi, 9mm. From Israel.
David's star.
I want a 30-06.
It's party time!
The war begins.
Lets pray.
Our Father,
who art in heaven...
hallowed be thy name...
Gansters have the guns
but they don't shoot.
Knockout's one bullet
was like ten of Ze's bullets.
Ze couldn't stand it.
He attacked.
The ghetto was like Hell
but now it had become Hell!
I decided to go out.
That's how I became a journalist.
Nice picture!
That's Rogerio Ris' for sure.
What was I sayng?
As every professional...
I started from the lower level,
from the bottom.
Without knowing
what was ahead of me...
Instead if going home
I went to the newspaper's offices.
Someone from the City Of God
worked at the laboratory.
He helped me to fulfil
the dream of my life.
Rogerio, is
the Rocket. Photographer.
-He is an admirer of yours.
-You have a good taste, Rocket.
I am leaving.
Nice guy!
A personal revenge
leaded to war.
The City of God has been devided.
You couldn't
cross it.
Nor to go to a relative.
Those who lived to the ghetto
were considered as gangsters.
We were living our own Vietnam.
Volunteers
were giving their lives.
The Kids.
Somebody hit me.
The war
was forgiving everything.
One of Ze's guys kicked me.
Take this.
He raped my sister...
-Ze took our home.
-Kill for your pride.
I am Siago,
Benny's friend.
You know how to read?
Spell?
-I am good.
-You are hired.
To revenge my father's
killer.
-What's your name?
-My name is Oto.
What's happening?
-He works.
-He needs a gun.
He won't last a week.
A year later, nobody
remembered how it all started.
The aim was, to undertake
enemy's bussines...
to buy guns and to extend
the enterprise.
I sniff, I killed, I stole.
I am a man!
The TV showed interest.
The police would intervene.
A gangster from
the city of God, was arrested.
Manuel Massando
also known as Knockout Ned...
is at hospital after an attack
of Ze's gang.
He gave us an interview.
-Does the war continue?
-Yes, it continues.
Were many people killed?
Many. Innocent mostly.
If a person knowns me
that's enough for Ze to kill him.
-Is the police absent?
-They hunt me, not him.
I am in jail while he
kills people without bothering.
Knockout Ned believes
that the war will continue.
Cop promised
to dislocate the gangs.
I am the boss and he is
on the newspaper!
-Did you find mine?
-Knockout's only.
My name must be somewhere.
-Can you read?
-the pictures. Nothing.
-What the Hell are you doing?
-Those are the announcements.
Read everything!
-There are no articles!
-Do you want to be shot?
We'll show them
who is the boss!
Give me the camera!
-Take me a picture.
-I don't know how it works.
Take me.
Back...
-It doesn't click.
-You fools.
You fucked me, assholes.
I'll call an acquaintance.
He came.
take the camera.
Well, Kid?
Aren't you a photographer?
Take us a picture.
-You broke it.
-Not me.
Needs some fixin.
-What's your name?
-Rocket.
Pull one more.
Two lines.
With your guns.
-You're out, damnit!
-Speak kindly.
-Show us the pictures.
-We must develop these photos.
How much does it cost?
Take this money
and bring the pictures.
-I have to remove the film.
-Hold the camera.
Benny wanted to give it to you.
It is yours.
Don't forget
the pictures.
Can u develop
this film?
I can't, Rocket,
I'll get in trouble.
I work only for the newspaper. I'll get fired.
Develop this, Piere.
And this.
I am going for lunch.
You are lucky.
Dimensions?
For the enlargement.
Whatever you think is better.
I am in big trouble.
I am dead.
Somebody signed
his conviction.
I would smash his face!
You stole my pictures!
They will kill me!
What are you talking about?
They'll kill me
because of you!
The pictures
were at the laboratory.
Everything that is in the laboratory
is for publication.
-I saw them, I published them.
-You stole them.
-Give them to me.
-Here, take them.
-Don't you have more?
-Relax. What's your name?
Rocket?
Nice to meet you, Marina.
Relax. I've got your money.
When a picture is published
we pay the photographer.
Do you want to become a photographer?
Nice start with a frontpage!
-How did you take them?
-I live there.
Not even one photographer managed
to go to the ghetto.
If you bring more
pictures of Ze...
the newspaper will buy them.
-Can you?
-I don't know.
-What's the problem?
-I can't go there again at night.
-And the day?
-It is a risk.
At last they understood
that I'm the Boss.
What the name of this photographer
friend of yours?
He is good. I'll take
to show you.
Yes, or not?
It's a big chance.
You took the right decision.
I'll give you films, lenses
and another camera.
Come to see the equipment
office.
There is another problem also.
Where am I going to sleep tonight?
I can't go back.
This one is 135 mm.
Do you shoot from near or from a distance?
-Can you measure the light?
-Yes.
Don't you think you are too close?
I don't know how I managed
to talk to them like this.
Maybe I was about to die
but I had a camera...
and a chance
to become a photographer.
What is more, he had
the whole night for us.
-Do you want to eat something?
-No thanks.
Won't you eat, or drink?
A joint?
Try this.
Time to sleep.
-I'll show you your bed
-Have you got hot water?
Yes, haven't you try
hot bath?
No. We got boiling water
in the saucepan.
-Why are you standing there?
-In which room am I going to sleep?
Unfortunately, I have only one room.
We will sleep together.
I won't tell you much
about my first sexual experience.
Somewhere else, another one, a more
important erotic scene was taking place.
Redhead was helping Knockout
to escape.
without a shot.
The guard was at
the hands of the nurse.
Meanwhile, Ze
was investing on ammo...
To terminate
Redhead.
He was heavily equiped even though
he didn't have to pay.
Do you remember the shotgun?
It is a semi automatic shotgun.
You haven't seen a Brouning like this.
It can even shoot down airplanes.
I want what I asked for.
The american ÁR-15.
They don't exist in Brasil.
-I don't give a shit.
I've got the solution. Rouger
Have you seen this before?
Like the ÁR-15. Same galiber
but lighter.
With infrared vision?
400 blasts per minute?
Are you trying to fool me?
I'll fuck you.
Go now, no money
no guns.
What am I supposed to say to the boss?
-Your problem. Think something.
Beat it, Fatty
Će made a big mistake
he didn't know that...
Behind every dealer
there is a big trader.
Did you see this?
Why do they want an ÁR-15?
They will make investigations
Cops. We'll get busted.
Do you think that I will betray you?
I'll fix it, but
don't get involved again.
Charlie! Come here.
Tell him...
Let's go now to the fucking dealer.
Come here, kids.
-Do you like chicken?
-It depends.
We'll eat chicken and
for dessert... Redhead.
I have a gift for you.
-One big for you.
-Are you giving us guns?
Yes, but I want you beside me
against Redhead.
-Can we steal later?
-Not at the ghetto.
-Do you know how to shoot?
-More or less.
Come to help
the kids!
I know. You do it like this.
THE BEGINING OF THE END
Grab the chicken!
If Ze catches you
he'll kill you.
He has to find me first.
Kid, grab the chicken!
-The Cops!
-Don't run away!
Butthead! Fuckin faggot!
Get the Hell outta here!
Let them kill
each other
Rocket!
Take us a picture!
Why are you standing like this?
Kill the mothafucker!
-Relax, don't move.
-It hurts!
Relax, Kid!
Why did you join
this fuckin war?
Knockout Ned!
Ze is down!
Hang on, I'll help you.
-What's your name
-My name is Otto.
I want revenge
for my father's death.
Ze's down!
Hang on.
Cops!
Down! Hands behind your head!
-It's you that I want.
-You're through, pal.
Handcuffs on him.
-Rocket, where're you going;
-I got something to do.
We got some arragments to do, Će.
Not you. You're the gift
for the Media.
-Is it 10.000?
-Almoist. That's all I got.
That's all, Boss.
We looked everywhere.
Let him go.
The ring? Is it gold?
Fuck it.
You owe us the rest.
Fuckin war!
Knockout Ned is dead
and I'm broke!
Your fucked, right?
We'll do some robberies
to get back my job.
-Your job, Će?
-Is it tough for you, boy?
For our friend, mothafucker!
Attack!
We are the Bosses!
That photograph
will make a professional.
That photograph, will make me famous.
Maybe it becomes a front page
of a magazine.
I won't worry about Ze anymore.
But the police?
The Boss of the city
of God, falls down dead...
That photograph
it could kill us?
-It gave u work.
-It made me internal.
-You make some money, right?
-Yeah, some..
-That journalist? Was she good?
-Good enough.
-You didn't like it?
-How would they know about fuckin?
Cocoa stole three houses
at Bara.
Let's do him.
-Who killed Roger?
-Bif.
Let's kill the Boss
and Gringo.
It's just the two of us
plus three more...
Have u ever heard
of the Red Brigade?
No, but if they come
we'll do'em.
-Who knows how to write?
-Me, a little.
Let's make
a Black List.
Add in the List Nightbird
And Leonard!
And The Chinese, he thinks too
important. Claudio also!
Where is Giant?
I forgot to tell you,
my name is not Rocket any more.
I'm Wilson Rodriguez.
Photographer.
Based on a true story
Manuel Assando also known as
Knockout Ned, was hospitalized...
after he was "injured"
by Ze's men.
He gave us an interview.
Many died.
Mostly innocent.
just for knowing me...
just for being my friends.
If someone thinks that
he knows me, he's dead.
-Where is the police?
-They're after me, not him.
I went three times to jail while
he kills undisturbed.
They don't arrest him.
Knockout Ned claims
that the war will be continued.
Police officer promised
to take down...
