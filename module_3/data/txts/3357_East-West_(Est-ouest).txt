This is the untold story
of the making of the modern world.
A fresh perspective,
charting the spread of civilization
across the globe,
from the dawn of mankind
and the first cities and Empires
to the belief in One God.
We follow the flow of civilization
from the Middle East,
an extraordinary place
that has been a vital link
between the continents of Asia,
Africa and Europe for millennia...
an economic, scientific
and cultural center of the world.
This is an epic journey of discovery,
from the East to the West.
Istanbul -
the only city in the world
that sits astride two continents,
Europe and Asia.
This was once the capital
of one of the greatest
imperial powers in history -
the vast Ottoman Empire.
As the dream of a great dynasty
became a reality,
the Ottoman Sultanate developed
into a Renaissance Superpower.
The dynamism and sophistication
of their court at Topkapi Palace
inspired both fear and fascination
in the Empire and beyond.
In its golden age,
the Ottoman Empire
would become invincible
both on land and sea.
Revered as THE model -
tor state, trade and culture.
It is incredible . . .
from two points of view -- both
as a believer and as an architect
But, a tide of change
threatened to bring the Age of Empire
crashing to a close.
There is a real quantum shift
in the 19th century.
You get the sense
that they realise
they cannot survive
unless they start to face outwards.
It was a time when relations
with the West would shape the East.
This is the story
of the Ottoman Empire and the West.
In the 16th century,
the Ottoman Empire expanded
across three continents.
The Ottomans controlled
much of Western Asia,
North Africa
and South-eastern Europe.
At the head
of the ruling Ottoman dynasty
was Sultan Suleiman ll -
known in the West
as Suleiman the Magnificent.
1529.
The 300,000-strong
Ottoman war machine
has pushed its way
to the gates of Vienna.
Suleiman has shaken Christian Europe
to its core.
It is a watershed moment in history.
But after months of siege,
Vienna's defenders prevail.
The prolonged siege
and upcoming winter
force the Sultan to change his mind.
But, although their advance
may have been checked at Vienna,
the Ottomans were still
a permanent fixture in Europe.
And within the Empire, their wealth
and potency seemed unaffected.
One priceless object
in Topkapi Palace
epitomizes the extent
of Suleiman's power.
This is one of Sultan Suleiman's swords
It is one of those that bears his name.
It reflects the refined
workmanship of Suleiman's era.
It's plain, but with very high quality, elaborate workmanship.
On it there is a name, sometimes
there are poems or prayers,
but generally the Sultan's
own swords carry his title.
Sultan Suleiman Shah bin Salim .
. . and so on . . .
The end of this inscription has worn away, but you
get a sense of the full title from the start.
Made almost 500 years ago,
this sword could have been carried
in a court ceremony
by Suleiman himself,
as a display of royal splendor.
This sword shows that Suleiman
could obtain the finest resources
and attract
the most talented craftsmen
from both inside and outside
the Empire.
Generally, precious stones
came from outside the empire.
We still call this one Ruby or Yakut.
Rubies usually came from places like India or Burma.
Firuze came from the city of Firuz in Iran,
that's why we call it Firuze in Turkish
But in the West it's known as
turquoise meaning "Turkish blue".
This parchment map was made
around 1560 for Sultan Suleiman
by cartographer
Al-Hajj Abul Hassan.
The Ottoman flags flying over places
like Belgrade, Buda and Rhodes
show that despite the setback
at Vienna,
much of Europe
was now under Ottoman control.
And it was not only on land
that the Ottomans had been
interfering in European concerns.
Now, Suleiman's navy became
the scourge of the Christian West.
Behind the scenes
at lstanbul's Naval Museum
is a restoration warehouse.
Inside, it houses a unique bounty...
Ottoman vessels, kept under wraps.
These are imperial kayaks and galleys
that once sailed the Black Sea
and Mediterranean...
The task of restoring them
to their original glory has begun.
They are relics of a time
when the Ottomans were known
by friend and foe alike
as the “lords of the sea”.
We are standing on the oldest and the
only surviving original galley.
This gallay dates from the 16th century.
It is impossible for any Mediterranean
historian not to feel excited
when faced with such an example.
There are benches, three-person benches
In each row there are 24 benches. In
total there are spaces for 144 oarsmen.
This was the age of discovery -
a time when European states
had begun to colonize the New World
and trade spices as far afield
as the Indian Ocean.
Now, Ottoman fleets
attempted to monopolize
the lucrative trade from the east.
They captured strategic
island and coastal outposts,
turning the Mediterranean
into an Ottoman lake.
To grasp control
of the shipping lanes
the Ottomans employed
an ingenious tactic.
The countless pirates, privateers
and corsairs that roamed the seas
were usually lawless raiders
and traders.
But, by making shrewd
and tactical alliances,
Sultan Suleiman turned
the most sea-worthy corsairs
into Ottoman Admirals.
This 16th century miniature
shows the Sultan
receiving the most successful
privateer in Ottoman history.
His name was Hayreddin Barbarossa.
Barbarossa is among the whole of 16th Century Europe's . . .
most charismatic figures.
Barbarossa is a hero who has
been immortalized . . .
in novels, poems, wall hangings,
songs -- every type of literature.
Under Barbarossa's command,
the Ottomans interrupted
vital European sea-borne trade.
Cities all over Europe saw
their livelihoods hang by a thread.
16th century Europe may have been
divided by internal rivalries,
but they had a common enemy.
The Ottomans were such a threat,
that Western Europe formed
a “Holy League” to defend themselves.
Two of the largest navies
ever assembled,
clashed off the coast of Greece
at Lepanto.
The battle of Lepanto is often
seen as a breaking point
As soon as Cyprus was captured by the Ottomans, the
great powers -- the Papacy, Spain, and Venice . . .
created an alliance and were determined to
bring an end to this problem once and for all.
This ends with a thrashing
for the Ottomans.
In the course of the battle,
the Ottomans lost four times
as many ships as the Europeans,
and double the troops.
Lepanto was celebrated
by the Holy League
as a major victory.
Now, they hoped to reclaim control
of the Mediterranean.
But, most importantly,
the idea that the Ottomans could be
decisively beaten was born.
In the West, this naval battle
has traditionally been seen
as a major turning point
in the struggle against the Ottomans.
But in the East,
this was just a setback.
Within a year, the Ottomans
had rebuilt their fleet.
Lepanto was far from the end
of Ottoman power.
In their relations with the Ottomans,
Europe's mercantile powers
walked a tightrope -
between alliance and defense.
Ambassadors from Francis I's France
and Elizabeth I's England
were sent on diplomatic missions
to the Ottoman court
as treaties
of “friendship and commerce”
became essential to their survival.
In this Ottoman miniature,
King John Sigismund of Hungary
is depicted paying homage
to Suleiman.
It reveals the continuing influence
of the Ottomans
upon the Western world.
You can't understand Europe
without the Ottomans,
and you can't understand the
Ottomans without Europe.
This doesn't only apply to the
period of Suleiman the Magnificent,
it was like this from the start
to the end of the Empire.
European identity was created by being both
in alliance with and opposition to the Turks.
So we are talking about two
entities which created each other.
At Topkapi Palace western visitors
discovered an imperial playground
that could equal any European
Renaissance court -
in riches, taste
and in the language of kingship.
Their reports of the splendor
of Suleiman's court
earned him the title,
Suleiman the Magnificent.
But perhaps Suleiman's
greatest legacy
was his creation
of a system of government
that the world still uses today.
Suleiman's second period saw the
creation of the first modern government.
in Suleiman's government there
was a regular army . . .
a powerful tax system and a strong
bureaucracy which maintained it.
This was established in
Suleiman's second period,
Modern European governments, by
taking this as an example . . .
began an era of building
modern nation governments
Topkapi didn't just become
a center of modern government,
it became a model of artistic design.
Here, the Ottomans drew together
the different artistic styles
of East and West,
and founded their own
Ottoman means of expression.
Even after Suleiman's time,
later sultans
built upon this tradition,
and endowed the Palace grounds with
ever more elaborate Ottoman designs.
Today, a restoration team
are replicating the work
of Ottoman master craftsmen
of the classical age.
The tiles in Topkapi Palace are all
very good examples of Ottoman era tiles
At the moment we are re-painting the
repaired parts of the original tiles
with exactly matching colors.
The Revan Pavilion was built in 1635,
to celebrate the conquest of Yerevan,
today the capital of Armenia.
It represents a pinnacle
of the Ottoman artistic legacy -
fueled by continuing conquests.
In the maturity of his reign,
at the age of 54,
Suleiman had reached
the zenith of his powers.
Now, he wanted to leave a lasting and
majestic impression upon Istanbul,
a symbol of his reign
for all the world to see.
And he relied
on a well-established genius.
His name was Sinan.
The chief architect of the Empire
for 5O years,
Sinan had designed and supervised
hundreds of Ottoman landmarks
from Damascus to the capital.
Now Suleiman commissioned Sinan
to build the tallest,
most extensive complex
in the history of the capital.
The Suleimaniye Mosque.
It is the ultimate expression
of the power of the Ottoman state.
Even today, its command of the city
is breathtaking.
As well as a mosque,
Sinan designed four colleges here,
a soup kitchen, a hamam,
a kervansaray and a hospital
as well as the tomb
that would be Sultan Suleiman's
final resting place.
The Suleimaniye complex quickly
became the focal point of the city.
People from all corners of the city would
come on a Friday and gather to pray . . .
and when they would leave . . .
they would see friends and acquaintences,
probably people they hadn't seen in a long time.
So there would be lovely conversation
and togetherness, just like in the past
with Greek culture in the Agora
and Roman culture in the Forum.
This is its modern continuation
in the 15th and 16th century.
In architecture, buildings are judged
not according to their height or size,
but by how much light they let in.
Sinan's buildings are truly the
lightest of all the domed structures.
For example, in churches
people can feel insignificant
Here you can see a suspended
ceiling of light.
This reminds us of the human dimension
and you do not feel overwhelmed.
The conformity
of intricate geometric shapes
was the culmination
of Sinan's lifelong effort
to achieve a unified space,
capturing in stone the ordered
Ottoman view of the world.
The Ottomans had a concept of
"nizam-i-alem" --"world order".
They attached great importance to ordiliness.
They organized themselves in a terrifically
ordered way and they think practically.
Therefore, when they do
a job they get results
and they take great care to to make
sure their results are lasting
Traditionally,
the late 17th and 18th centuries
are considered the beginning
of the end for the Ottoman Empire.
But, in reality,
the Empire was thriving.
The Empire stretched across Africa,
Asia and Europe -
from Algiers to Mosul
and from Medina
to the gates of Vienna.
The Ottomans controlled
the crossroads of trade routes
coming from every continent
and sub-continent
between East and West.
Ottoman merchants were prospering
in the capital
and the coastal provinces.
The small town of Birgi
in western Anatolia
retains its Ottoman character today,
and amidst the traditional houses,
is an echo of this time of plenty.
Built in 1761,
largely preserved
in its original state,
Cakir Aga Mansion seems,
at first sight,
to be a typical wooden mansion
of western Anatolia.
This magnificent three-story
building
belonged to Serif Aliaga,
the owner of the local tannery.
Yet the small details
in the mansion's decor
reveal that Serif Aliaga's world
extended far beyond Anatolia.
Western motifs reflect the ideas
carried into Ottoman harbors
by the French, English, Dutch
and Venetian traders
that flowed in and out of Birgi.
And there's a story hidden
in the friezes of Cakir Aga mansion.
Serif Aliaga's two wives,
one from the vibrant capital Istanbul
and the other from the Aegean
trading port of Izmir,
were pining for their hometowns.
A solution was found...
as a comfort to them,
Serif Aliaga had their cities
painted on their bedroom walls.
Izmir in this room
Istanbul in this,
capturing in miniature,
what was the economic powerhouse
of the Empire
over 500 km (310 miles) to the north.
But the arrival of the modern age
would present the Ottomans
with new challenges,
with pressure and influence
from Europe
penetrating all the way to Istanbul.
The Ottoman elite
began to change their outlook...
It you travel along the Bosporus
in Istanbul today,
you can still find clues
as to how the Ottoman world
was in transition.
The Bosporus is a good example
of how things are changing.
By the 18th century you have
an explosion of the old center.
The Palace is no longer contained
within the limits of the city.
The Sultanas, the Palace,
the Sultan himself
will start to use the Bosporus
as a place where you can flaunt
and display your splendor
by implanting these new kinds
of mansions, seaside mansions.
The Ottomans began to build elaborate
western-style architecture
along the shore of the Bosporus
If you look
at some of these mansions,
they're generally built
so as to enjoy
the scenery of the Bosporus.
The rest, that is the backside,
is used as a, as a huge garden where
you'd have your Harem and whatever,
but the stately mansion
would be right on the sea.
And that's a way of enjoying the
city that did not exist previously.
This new pleasure culture was not
only promoted by the Ottoman elite.
More and more European diplomats
retired to grand new
waterfront embassies.
The Bosporus has become
a grand canal
ii you take Venice as an example -
this is a huge canal
where people are basically
expressing their power
by their residences
and by their sheer presence
on this stretch of water.
This grand waterway
is the age-old dividing line
between the continents
of Europe and Asia.
It has been an important trade route
since ancient times.
Now, as European trade
with the Americas
began to eclipse
the old Mediterranean markets,
a new world order was emerging.
If you look at the 18th century
you already have a sense of society
that is changing.
The Mediterranean
is being marginalized.
That is true of the Ottomans,
it's true of Venice,
it's also true of the Spaniards.
What is rising
is the Atlantic economies,
it's the Dutch, the English,
to a certain extent the French -
so the world is changing
the balance of the world is changing
and in that new world
the Ottomans feel
they no longer have a hold
on modernity,
on what is happening.
Ever since the French revolution
in 1789,
the spark of nationalism within
the Empire had been fanned to flame...
In a newly industrialized world,
a great wave of radical
social and political unrest
was building momentum.
With the backing of European powers,
the Empire's non-Muslim minorities
demanded independence
from the Ottoman state.
And in 1827, disaster struck -
in support of the Greek
Battle for Independence,
Britain, France and Russia
completely annihilated
the Ottoman fleet
in the Battle of Navarino.
Nationalism had begun
to rip the Ottoman world apart.
In 1830 they were forced
to grant Greece their independence
and their control of Egypt was
in little more than name alone.
In 1875 Serbia, Montenegro,
Wallachia and Moldavia
also declared their independence.
And in 1878 the Ottomans lost control
of Bulgaria,
Bosnia Herzegovina and Romania.
Ravaged by war - the map
of the Empire was being redrawn.
There was a pressing need
to prevent the total disintegration
of the Empire.
This Royal Edict of Reform
is part of a movement
that would change
the Ottoman state forever -
and it was called the Tanzimat,
meaning “reorganization”.
The Ottoman elite began to reorder
its administration -
but this time
along Western European lines.
Nowhere was this need for
reorganization felt more strongly
than in the military.
Uniforms and artillery were bought
from Britain and France.
Gradually a modern Ottoman army
emerged.
The Ottoman Sultanate needed
to deter attack from outside forces
in the East and the West -
and develop highly visible symbols
of central control -
even in the furthest
reaches of the Empire.
Over 1200 km (750 miles) from Istanbul,
on the eastern flanks of Anatolia,
standing on the Silk Road,
near the Iranian border and facing
Mount Ararat -
the effect of the emerging
new world order is evident.
Ishak Pasa Palace.
This extraordinary fortified palace
was vital to Ottoman control
of these tough borderlands.
It was a strategic hub in
the two-year long territorial dispute
between the Ottoman and Persian
Empires in the early 19th century.
This palace sits
at a crossroads of civilization.
Its flamboyant architectural fabric
reflects a fusion of Persian,
Georgian, Armenian,
Seljuk, Ottoman and Western styles.
Inside,
it bears many of the hallmarks
of a miniature Topkapi Palace.
Complete with law courts, harem,
and a magnificent private mosque
of imperial dimensions.
Here, carved inscriptions
of Qur'anic verses line the walls.
Built at central government's
command,
lshak Pasa Palace was closely
controlled from Istanbul
for almost two centuries.
It is the ultimate symbol
of Ottoman power in Eastern Anatolia.
Proof of Ottoman efforts
to maintain
even the most remote
reaches of its Empire.
In a similar way,
Ottoman central government
developed close control
of the sacred Hajj route - in Syria.
Damascus,
a jewel in the Ottoman crown
reflecting the wealth
of the Empire.
Benefiting from far eastern trade
along the Hajj route,
and European trade through
the Eastern Mediterranean ports
Damascus became a home for a local
version of Ottoman modernism.
Tucked away in the maze-like
alleyways of the old city
is a hidden 19th century treasure.
Built in 1830,
Beit Nizam once
housed affluent merchant families.
At face value it's a traditional
Damascus house.
Damascene houses
are famous for this design.
Er, it all revolves
around the courtyard.
The courtyard is the heart.
It's always big
with trees and fountains,
and on the southern side
you always have this eyvan
which is where you'd receive
your guests.
But look closely and there are clues
to the close connection
between Istanbul and Damascus
in the 19th century.
Within this Ottoman-Arabic setting
the effects of the new and old
are there on the walls.
If you look at the ornamentation
over here,
this is very typical - it goes
back to maybe the 13th century.
But then around the 1830s
we start to see something new.
This is what we call
Ottoman Baroque,
and you see a much more sort of
voluptuous design, if you want,
a much more high relief,
a three-dimensional carving,
very, very busy.
Ottoman Baroque is a very special
part of interior design history
because it's directly linked
with the Ottoman Empire's
attempts to modernize.
Nizam House reveals
that Sultan Mahmud ll's reforms
had successfully improved
the relationship
between the palace and the provinces.
This is called Ka'at El-Enab
meaning the Hall of Grapes
because of this extensive carving,
and gilded stucco,
it's just very crazily,
ridiculously, heavily ornamented -
inspired straight out of Versailles
if you like,
but actually,
it's coming from Istanbul.
Walls that would have been blank
in a typical Damascene house
were for the first time adorned
with Italian-style frescoes.
Istanbul had become
a symbol of modernity
for the whole Ottoman world.
Here we have carvings
of Istanbul landscapes,
a dome, a minaret.
So, fusing an Islamic
Ottoman identity
with the wealth and power
of the baroque style
which was prominent in Europe.
And the Ottoman identity...
if you look up at the ceiling
you immediately see the symbols
of the Ottoman Sultan.
It's really expressing
this Ottoman desire to modernize
and to step up to what's happening
in European culture
and to be on equal footing,
while also retaining its integrity
and its identity
at a time of a lot of crisis
and pressure happening.
But, in spite of these efforts
to maintain control of the Empire,
the economic and political axis
of the world tilted west.
Now, as newly industrialized
European factories
churned out manufactured goods -
household wares,
even cotton fabrics woven in Europe
started to take over the stalls
in Ottoman bazaars.
Gold poured out
from the coffers of the Empire.
And countries like Britain and France
began to use their economic advantage
to demand more favorable
trade treaties with the Ottomans.
As these two worlds interacted,
Ottoman culture would leave a lasting
impression on the European West.
The fascination
with the Ottoman world,
was part of a rising Western
academic movement -
Orientalism.
For the first time, translations
of great Middle Eastern works
such as the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam
and the Arabian Nights
were reaching markets in the West -
and their translators
were European travelers...
In Morllake Cemetery in London
there is the tomb of one of the most
famous Orientalist adventurers:
Richard Burton - translator
of the 1001 Arabian Nights.
The impact of
the Arabian Nights
on 18th, 19th and 20th
literature is massive.
I think there's no book in
the world except the Bible
that had a bigger influence
on British literature.
Inside the tomb are objects gathered
on Burton's travels
in the Ottoman-controlled
Middle East.
The things we see hanging here
were accumulated while
he and Isabelle were in Damascus,
when Burton was serving
as Consul there.
He collected all sorts of stuff.
These camel bells you see here,
were important for Burton -
they had kind of
symbolic significance.
Burton made clandestine journeys
to Mecca and Medina -
one of the first Europeans to explore
the distant and relatively unknown
lands of the Hajj.
The Royal Geographical Society
somewhat hesitantly sponsored
Burton's extremely dangerous
pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina.
It was dangerous because
he was doing it in disguise;
if that disguise was uncovered
and he was revealed to be an infidel
he'd almost certainly
have been killed on the spot.
I think Burton's love of the Orient
is a product of his revulsion
against British society -
it's stuffiness, it's conformity,
it's Victorianism,
it's lack of adventure, he much
preferred Islam to Christianity.
Burton's tales are celebrated
as masterpieces
of 19th century literature.
But they also established an image
of the Middle East
as a place of intrigue
and uncertainty.
Artists, inspired
by the likes of Burton,
traveled and painted romanticized
versions of the Orient.
Frequently there was a sensual,
dangerous side
to Orientalist paintings.
I think what's fascinating
about this time,
is that the East
is either portrayed
as being very, very good
or very, very bad.
So you have these two versions,
you have the bloodthirsty Moor,
the bloodthirsty Turk.
And then this very romantic idea
of this sensuous, mystical place
where everything is wonderful,
where the air smells sweet.
This is a time of colonialism.
So it's almost as ii
the West is saying
“We are now in charge
of portions of the East.
“We're almost unveiling it."
Also, it is a very difficult place
to get hold of -
it does have its own mystery -
and I think that's what's
being realised in the painting
that even though the West is
physically in many Eastern lands -
it still can't quite grab
the essence of what the East is.
In the real world
of the Ottoman Empire,
successive Sultans were battling
to keep their increasingly
disparate peoples together.
The Tanzimat reforms
made a break with tradition,
leaving behind
the old Mlle! system,
granting the Empire's minority
communities or “nations"
equal status
with its Muslim citizens.
In this Imperial Reform Edict
Sultan Abdulmecid I pledged
that any distinction that made any
of his subjects inferior to another -
on account of their religion,
language, or race -
would be forever effaced
from the Administrative Protocol.
As their efforts to keep up
with the West increased,
the Ottoman Sultanate moved
to a new seat of power.
Today the Turkish Palace Guards
still protect Dolmabahce Palace.
The ultimate Rococo monument,
it wouldn't look out of place
amongst the chateaus of France.
This lavish palace represents
the pinnacle of the Tanzimat era.
But, despite having all the trappings
of a great European nation,
Ottoman westernization
had only touched the surface.
Beneath the palace's rich facade,
the limits of the Tanzimat reforms
were beginning to show.
The Ottoman administration's efforts
had not been enough
to convince each different “nation"
that their future lay
within the Empire.
The Tanzimat was obviously something
that started very well
in the 1840s, '50s -
but it's true that the Tanzimat
was doomed in a sense
because it was very difficult
for an Empire
to really er, transform itself
to the point of suiting
all the necessities
and the desires, the expectations
of nations, of nation states.
So it was doomed from the start in
the sense that it was too complex,
it was too modern in a sense for
the structure of the Ottoman Empire.
Dolmabahce Palace is adorned
with exquisitely crafted
furnishing and ornaments -
mostly from Europe.
The centerpiece
of the ceremonial hall
is the world's largest
Bohemian crystal chandelier-
a gift from Queen Victoria
of Great Britain.
It dominates the room -
a symbol of the influence
of European powers
at the very heart
of the Ottoman administration.
Westernization had been
a very expensive process.
Until 1850, the Ottoman Empire
was the only Empire of the age,
never to have contracted
foreign debt.
But now, the Ottoman state
began to rely on European capital.
Dolmabahce Palace is a palace that
speaks of power, of flaunting power.
It's really the embodiment
of a modern Empire
or an Empire
that's trying to modernize.
And there's a cost to that,
there's a price to pay
and that price is the debt,
the Ottoman debt
which starts in the 1850's
more or <i>less</i> with the Palace.
And the Palace is just one drop
in that enormous debt
that will eventually urn,
force the er, the Empire
into um, a formal er, bankruptcy
in 1875.
Political reform
was desperately needed
if the Empire was to have
any hope of a future.
In this room in 1876,
the first Ottoman Parliament
was announced with great fanfare.
But, even this was not enough
to keep the Empire together.
Although the Ottomans
continued to modernize,
once the economic and political axis
of the world tilted west,
it heralded the beginning of the end
of Ottoman supremacy.
But there was one final attempt
to bring together
the Islamic majority of the Empire.
A forgotten rail yard
just south of Damascus -
once this was one of the major
stopping points
on the pilgrimage route to Mecca.
These decommissioned old locomotives
bear silent witness to an important
piece of Middle Eastern history.
Once cutting edge technology,
these are the original carriages
and engines
that transported the first
Hajj pilgrims by rail in 1908.
They traveled on the Hejaz Railway -
a railway developed and constructed
under the last Ottoman Sultan,
Adbulhamid ll.
Sultans and Caliphs throughout
the history of Muslim civilization,
had to protect the pilgrimage
um, yearly trip.
It was the legitimizing feature
of their rule.
It they protected the pilgrims,
they protected the holy cities,
then they were good Muslim rulers.
And so what Sultan Abdul Hamid did
was link this sacred right
with modern industry.
The railway followed
the ancient trail of camel caravans.
And it slashed
the arduous journey time
from 40 days to four days.
The route passed via Damascus,
and eventually terminated in Medina.
It brought much-needed innovation
to the region
and strengthened
the Ottoman connection
with key Islamic territories
at a time of unrest.
The railway was the embodiment
of the Sultan's plan for “Islamic union" -
bringing together Muslims not just
within the Empire but beyond.
1600 km (1000 miles) of track
was laid across pitiless desert
deep into the heart of Arabia
and across the mountains of Hejaz.
It brought together
conscripts from Turkey,
steel from Belgium,
engineers and technology from Germany.
Sultan Abdul Hamid brought in
European industrial expertise.
German industry was extremely active
in the construction of this railway.
Over here we have here indicator -
the German plaque
and an Arabic plaque.
So a collaboration of Ottoman
and German enterprises.
But the Ottoman Empire
was in debt -
and the Hejaz project
seemed an impossible dream.
Yet remarkably, nearly a third of
the cost of this vast public project
was met by charitable donations.
Muslims from all over the world
participated in this great
pan-Islamic enterprise
aimed at helping fellow pilgrims
reach Mecca.
When the railway line
had opened for business,
it transported thousands of pilgrims.
But the railway also became a target.
During World War One,
the Hejaz route
was irrevocably damaged
by Allied attacks.
This great Ottoman connection
to the Holy Land was over-
it would never go
as far as Medina again.
The Hejaz project had been
an important achievement
for the Islamic world -
but it couldn't stem
the tide of change.
Crippled by civil strife
and saddled with debt,
the reign of the Ottoman dynasty
was nearly over.
In the aftermath of World War One,
the story of one of largest
and longest-lasting Empires in world
came to an end.
At its peak, the Ottoman Empire had
stretched from Algiers to Mosul,
from Medina to the gates of Vienna.
They had commanded and preserved
the most dynamic region in the world.
This land that from ancient times
has shaped the modern world
giving it agriculture,
cities.
And the belief in One Universal God.
The land that had nurtured
the brilliant minds
that laid the basis
of the European Renaissance.
This crossroads of East and West has
inspired the story of civilization
for 12,000 years.
It is a story that has no end.
