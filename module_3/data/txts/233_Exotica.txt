You have to ask yourself...
what brought the person to this point.
What was seen in his face,
his manner, that channeled him here.
You have to convince yourself...
that this person has something
hidden that you have to find.
You check his bags,
but it's his face...
his gestures that
you're really watching.
Thank you.
He's staring straight at you.
Look at him, carefully.
What do you see?
Security 4 to Baggage Claim 17.
- Where you headed?
- Downtown.
- You want to split it?
- S-Sure.
What? Not tonight.
Are you sure?
Well, can't you cancel?
What are these?
Ballet tickets for tonight.
- You don't like ballet?
- Well, some ballets.
Well, that's exactly
what this is: Some ballet.
Look, you can always scalp
the tickets at the door.
You mean,
take these in exchange...
- for you paying your part of the fare.
- Well, what do you think?
- See ya, John.
- Good night, John.
- See you guys.
- See ya.
Christina, here you are.
Hurry and get dressed.
- People are asking for you.
- * Exotica *
- She's right over there. I'll get her.
- * Exotica *
Bye.
Yeah!
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen...
and have a nice,
big round of applause...
for Kali!
Kali.
Yes, indeed. Kali.
And you, too, can-You, too,
can have Kali come over to your table...
for only five dollars, where she can
show you the mysteries of her world.
Trust me, gentlemen. Trust me.
Baby, baby, baby!
Do it for me, baby!
My God, that's incredible.
That's incredible.
Let me ask you something, gentlemen.
What is it that gives a
schoolgirl her special innocence?
Her sweet fragrance? Fresh flowers...
light as a spring rain?
Oh, my God. My God.
Or is it her firm, young flesh
inviting your every caress...
enticing you to explore...
her deepest and most private secrets?
Well, gentlemen, I'm gonna let you
decide that one for yourselves.
Please join me in welcoming a sassy...
bit of jailbait to our stage.
Yes, indeed.
Come out, sweet Chrissy.
Wherever you are, baby,
come on out.
You think you're bad, baby?
You're bad.
That will be $5.50.
Thank you.
- Eric?
- What?
Linda finished her dance.
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen.
Give it up.
Yeah, gentlemen. Yes.
Have a nice, big round
of applause for Linda. Yeah.
Yes, indeed, Linda.
And just a reminder that there is
nothing Linda would love more...
than to slink over to your table and...
give you your own private
show for only five dollars.
That's right.
Five dollars is all it takes to
have one of our beautiful foxes...
come over to your table and
get you all hot and bothered.
But, hey, why be bothered...
when you're being treated like a king?
You've had a rough day.
Don't you think you owe it
to yourselves to...
do something that'll make you
feel like you're someone special?
You are someone special.
Five dollars is all
it takes to prove it.
Yes, let's have a nice big
round of applause for Michelle.
My God, that was beautiful.
Baby, you come out.
And just to remind you that there's
nothing Michelle would love more...
than to come over to your table and
give you your own private dance.
Hello, gentlemen!
Anybody out there?
Anybody alive?
Anybody, for five dollars,
you can have Kali.
Kali at your own private table.
Let me ask you something, gentlemen.
What is it about a schoolgirl...
that gives her that special innocence?
Is it the way that
they can gaze at you...
waiting for you to say something
with so much expectation and hope...
that you're just...
you're just paralyzed into...
into silence?
- Look, I want to give this back to you.
- Why?
Well, you see,
those tickets were given to me...
and I just feel uncomfortable
about having sold them.
- That's okay.
- No, no, no, really, I...
We never really introduced ourselves.
I'm Thomas.
David.
Can I use this
to take you out for a drink?
- That's very kind of you, but...
- But what?
But I really have to get home.
Thanks.
Are you available next Thursday?
- I think so, yeah.
- Good, good.
- Tracey?
- Yeah?
I'm not that boring, am I?
- What do you mean?
- Well, the earphones.
I mean, we used to listen
to the radio...
and you used to ask me
all sorts of questions.
So you want me to ask more questions?
Sure. Yeah, I mean, if there's
something y-you want to know.
Okay. I'll see
what I can think up.
- Say hi to your dad.
- I will.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Did someone say something?
- No.
So, what's the point?
I've just noticed
a change in your attitude.
Look, I would understand if you would
prefer not to introduce Christina.
I could do it myself.
Actually, I've been thinking
that, perhaps...
I should be getting more involved
in the introductions overall.
I could have my own microphone,
like my mother used to do.
No, I mean, I actually
enjoy introducing Christina.
I mean, I find it
very therapeutic, you know?
- That's not what you're getting paid for.
- Well, it seems to me...
that I'm being paid to make every girl seem
like she's something special, right?
So, in order to do that,
I have to let my imagination run wild.
So, I mean, when it comes
to Christina, I, you know...
My imagination is bound
to run a little wilder.
There's nothing that I can
do to control that, Zoe.
Makes the clients uncomfortable.
And you think your state
puts them at ease?
Hey.
Is he kicking?
All the time.
Do you feel like touching it?
How are you feeling about this?
- Fine.
- Fine?
Are you happy?
For you.
What about you, Eric?
What about you?
Well, I guess I got to be pretty
careful about my feelings, right?
I mean...
that's why we have
a contract, isn't it?
There's plaster dust
all over the apartment.
No, I'm not exaggerating. No, I was
coughing in my sleep last night.
You told me that it was going to be
comfortable for me to live there...
and it is not comfortable.
There's plastic on the furniture.
That is not comfortable living.
Yeah. Oh, come on, look.
You told me you were going to strip the
wallpaper, not strip the walls down.
Well, no, if you'd,
if you'd told me in the first place...
If you'd told me what kind of job it was,
then I would have considered it.
Although, it's-it makes me seem
like you've maybe made a mistake.
That's what it makes me suspect.
What? No, it's too late now.
It's inaccessible.
I'm not gonna pay you. Pay you for what?
You didn't do the job.
Well, you did a job, but it's not
the job that I asked you to do.
It's not the job we agreed on.
Well, I can get anyone,
any number of people to do this.
Yeah, that's just fine with me.
Yeah, can I help you?
- Mr. Pinto?
- Yes.
I'm Francis Brown. We spoke
on the phone a couple of weeks ago.
- Revenue Canada.
- Oh, of course.
- How was your trip?
- It was fine.
- And when did you get back?
- Just yesterday.
Good weather?
Yes, yes, lovely. Yeah.
- Is this a good time, Mr. Pinto?
- Oh, sure.
- It's just that you seem a little...
- A little what?
- Flustered.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, I can't talk to you right now.
L-Later.
Okay.
So this is where I'd find
all the bank statements?
Yeah, that's right,
and those there.
Okay. Well, if I have any questions,
I'll let you know.
- Is it a little hot for you back here?
- It's, yeah.
You could turn it down a tad.
I suppose you have to be pretty careful
with the temperature with the animals.
Well, they're a lot hardier
than you'd think.
I wouldn't think they're not hardy.
I mean, just because they're exotic
doesn't mean they can't endure extremes.
It is, after all,
a jungle out there, isn't it?
So, how long will this take?
- An audit?
- Yes.
Well, it depends on
how prepared you are.
Have you got an accountant?
Well, no.
Well, no, not really, no.
Not really?
- So this will take a while?
- I could be done by the end of the day.
Or it might take a week.
It's difficult to say.
Okay. Well,
if you have any questions...
I'll let you know.
Did you know her?
Sort of.
She was your neighbor?
I... I baby-sat her
a couple times.
So you knew her pretty well?
Yeah. I did.
What about you?
I just... I heard this
thing was being organized, so...
It seems so...
surreal, doesn't it?
- What?
- That we'd find anything.
I mean, there's so many places you
could hide something in this country.
- My name's Eric.
- I'm Christina.
Hey, nice to meet you, Christina.
Well?
- Well, what?
- Don't you want to touch it?
You don't have to. It's one of those
things people normally like to do.
What is this thing about Eric calling
you "a sassy piece of jailbait"?
- What's this thing?
- It bothers me.
Why?
It makes you out like
a child or something.
Unlike the tartan skirt and my socks
or the blouse or the way I act, right?
Do you find it strange that he
would still want to work here?
Zoe, not all of us have the luxury of
deciding what to do with our lives.
It's a job, and he's
getting paid all right.
I just find it cruel.
So fire him.
As a favor.
How can you be so detached?
Well, I'm finished for the day.
For the day?
You mean you have to come back?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
When is a good time?
But, but, I thought you said it
was only going to take one day.
Well, it can only take a day.
But you have to understand, you don't
keep very well-organized books.
That's why you should really think
about getting someone in to help you.
Just somebody to come in
once or twice a week...
depending on the amount of activity
and... the type of activity.
What do you mean by that?
Well, some types of activity are
more complicated, aren't they?
It might take more effort
to account for.
I found a gun in one of the drawers.
- Well, that belonged to my dad.
- Your dad?
Yeah, I guess he just kept it,
just in case.
- In case of what?
- Well, in case of trouble.
With the animals?
Would Monday be a good time
for me to come back...
- Mr. Pinto?
- Oh, yeah.
Well, how about tomorrow?
I have appointments for tomorrow.
Actually, I'm pretty
busy 'til the end of the week.
Monday's not good?
No, Monday's fine.
- Around 10:00?
- Yeah, sure.
Well, good.
Have a nice weekend.
Strange to think that bird is
probably going to outlive us.
Strange?
Did you ever teach it to say anything?
Yes.
- What does it say, Harold?
- It doesn't really say it anymore.
It forgot?
I don't think so.
They're not supposed to forget.
It must have just lost interest.
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay. We're just talking about Felix.
What about him?
Dad?
I had the piano tuned.
It sounds beautiful.
So, how does it sound?
- It's good.
- Yeah? Good, good.
- Okay, well, I shouldn't be too late.
- What's "too late"?
- Around 11:00 or so?
- Okay.
You looking for tickets?
Yeah. How much?
That's too hot.
He comes in here every other night.
He has his favorite drink...
at his favorite table
with his favorite dancer.
Sometimes he has to wait for her,
and sometimes she's waiting for him.
She'll protect him.
She's his angel.
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's show time at the Exotica.
And just to remind you that
five dollars is all it takes...
to have one of our lovely ladies
come over to your table...
and show you the mysteries
of their world.
Now if that didn't turn you
on, gentlemen, nothing will.
Let's have a nice, big, warm round
of applause for Christina, gentlemen!
Yes, Christina!
What are you thinking?
I was just thinking,
what would happen if someone hurt you?
H-How could anyone hurt me?
If I'm not there to protect you.
I- You'll always be there to protect me.
An angel.
Why would somebody want
to do something like that?
How could somebody even think
of doing something like that?
You mustn't worry.
Eric! Eric!
All hot and bothered, yes, indeed.
Let's have a nice, big
round of applause for Melinda.
Listen, I feel bad about,
taking your money.
- Why?
- The tickets were given to me, and...
I should have given them away for free.
- Well, that would have been stupid.
- Why?
Because no one gives anything away.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, p-positive.
Do you consider my dad a friend?
- Why?
- J-Just asking.
Does he consider me a friend?
I don't know.
Why not?
'Cause he always seems
different when you're around.
- Different in what way?
- J-Tense.
Is that bad?
Well, I don't really like to
feel tense around my friends.
Well, sure, yeah.
I didn't like to feel tense around my
friends when I was your age either.
But you do now?
No, it's not a question
of liking it or not.
It's just something that happens.
Why?
Well... as you get older...
you become aware that the people
you meet and the person you are...
as carrying
a certain amount of baggage.
And, and that baggage creates tension.
So what do you do about it?
Well, you can pretend it's not there...
or you can choose not to have friends...
or you can acknowledge that it's
there and have friends anyway.
Like my dad?
Right.
I don't think that I like
my dad when he's around you.
Well, that's...
because your dad doesn't like
himself when he's around me.
But that's okay.
That's... part of what
friends do to each other.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I... I just graduated.
Really? So did I.
- Oh, yeah? In what?
- Radio communications.
- So, so is that what you do?
- That's what I'd like to do.
I do a little
freelance deejay stuff...
but, you know, right now
I'm just driving a cab.
I thought you might
do something like that.
Drive a cab?
No, do something
where, you use your voice.
Why?
I don't know why.
Because you're easy to listen to.
Because of my voice?
I just need to find
a structure, you know?
What do you mean?
Listen, I waste so much time, you know?
I just-My days just slip by, you know?
- Isn't that what days are supposed to do?
- Yeah.
Not if you want to make
something of yourself, you know?
What do you want to make of yourself?
I don't know. I just feel that I was
meant to do something with my time.
I mean, otherwise, I wouldn't be
thinking of this this way.
I'd be able to just continue
what I was doing, you know?
Do you have a lot of friends?
Not really. Do you?
- No.
- Yeah.
Do you ever feel like you need a friend?
Yeah, sometimes.
When?
Like right now.
Why?
'Cause I just met you and...
I just feel like
telling someone, you know?
No way. No way, no way.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Jesus.
- What's the matter?
"What's the matter?"
Her wigs, her clothes.
Sometimes I just feel like
throwing them all away, you know?
What are you looking for, Zoe?
- I mean, is this where you see your future?
- My future?
The club?
When Mom died, my immediate idea was
to get rid of this place. Just sell it.
I never thought it would
have any interest for me.
So why did it?
I used to be very shy as a child.
I used to watch my mother for hours...
just admiring her sense of freedom.
So when the opportunity came up,
I thought I would take on the challenge.
So you feel better about adopting her
options rather than creating your own?
I have created my own options too.
I know.
It's your contract
for the baby with Eric.
I found it.
Does he know?
I would hope so.
Otherwise he might just think I'm disgusted
with him for no particular reason.
Look, I really desperately
needed this child...
and it just worked out with Eric.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You know, I remember when your
mother built this hallway.
She... she built it for this very
rich man who used to come here.
He used to get off watching us dance for
other guys, so he actually paid her...
to construct this very special
place that he could watch us from.
Your mother never told us that.
She said it was to protect us...
so she could patrol things.
And I believed her.
Until Eric told me the truth.
Why did you believe him?
I made a choice.
And Eric promised me
he'd never lie to me.
How could anyone...
hurt you?
Take you away from me?
How could anyone?
What's this machine?
It's an incubator.
- Wh-What's it for?
- Well, what do you think it's for?
- Eggs.
- That's right.
Are they yours?
Wh-What do you mean?
I mean, shouldn't you be
sitting on them or something?
Oh, yeah.
Well, I guess I've abandoned the nest.
What's inside of them?
- The eggs?
- Yes.
Well, Hyacinth Macaws...
if you want to know the absolute truth.
And where did you get them?
From... very far away.
Hey, check her out?
I said check her out.
- Yeah.
- You talking to me?
Yes, I'm talking to you.
What? Check who out?
The babe that's dancing for you, man.
You've given her quite a run
for your money, man.
What do you mean by that?
- She's been dancing for you all night.
- Yeah.
Yeah, and not just tonight. I mean, I've
noticed you with her other nights too.
You come in here all the time or...
Yeah. All the time.
This-Visuals, you know?
It's good.
But...
she seems to have a bit of a
thing for you, doesn't she?
We... get along.
I'm sure you do, my friend.
What do you two talk about?
Just... the usual, I guess.
The usual?
I don't think you're talking
about what I would call "usual."
- Why not?
- Because I can tell.
You get pretty intense,
my friend.
Well, I guess that's just the way I am.
So, Hey, why don't you
give her a little touch?
- You're not supposed to touch.
- But she is into it, believe me.
Yeah.
- How do you know?
- Everybody knows, man.
Trust me, my friend.
Trust me. Just a little touch.
Nothing too drastic.
Then you will get
the full experience, my friend...
and you will love it.
You will love it. Okay?
And what happens when I touch her?
What happens?
You're outta here, man!
Get out!
Come on. Get down there.
Come on. Go.
Hey, what the hell you doin'?
Get off the road!
Move!
What's so funny?
It's like pettin' a gorilla.
Well...
Was your father this hairy?
No, I... I got it
from my mother.
I mean, I mean,
from my mother's side of the family.
That's where you
inherit hair patterns.
- My uncle's bald.
- On your mother's side?
Well, I guess I'm talking
about usual patterns.
There's always exceptions.
That's...
That's the way these things... work.
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?
No, I'm fine.
You don't look fine.
You worry about me, don't you?
You think this is normal?
- What?
- What we do.
What do we do?
That's just it.
We don't speak about it.
You know that feeling
you get sometimes, Tracey...
that you didn't ask to be
brought into the world?
Yeah.
Well, then who did?
What?
If you think that you didn't ask...
to be brought into the world...
then who did?
All I'm saying is nobody asked you if
you wanted to be brought into the world.
You just ended up getting here.
So the question is,
now that you're here...
who's asking you to stay?
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
Look, are you sure you're gonna be okay?
Yes.
Good night.
Good night.
- He touched you?
- He didn't want to.
- What do you mean?
- I know him.
- We all know him. He's crazy about you.
- Not like that.
Why didn't you get one of the
boys to handle this, Eric?
Because I didn't think of it.
I just saw him touch her, and...
Why didn't you ask him to leave?
- Because he wouldn't have listened.
- How do you know that?
Because he's in his own world,
the ass-wipe.
I don't know where
you're both coming from.
You are telling me that he touched you,
but he really didn't.
And you're saying that you overreacted,
but you didn't have a choice?
- I didn't.
- Why not?
Why not?
Because he touched you.
Okay.
All I'm concerned about
is if he makes a case...
I have to know what happened.
We told you what happened, Zoe.
And that is what happened?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Is that it?
Hi. This is Thomas.
I am not in at the present time,
but I am in town.
Please leave a message
following the beep.
Good morning.
You're probably not up yet,
so you haven't seen what I've done.
I'm a customs officer at the airport.
Actually, I saw you the other day when
you were having your bags inspected.
I know-I know how you probably
smuggled those eggs in.
There's a special unit at work. I think
they give them to the zoo or something.
They asked me where I got them.
I had to lie.
Where are they?
- I took them.
- Where?
- I'd like to see you again.
- Oh, no.
No, they're in the country now.
They're definitely in the country.
It's just I don't have
them with me presently,
but it doesn't mean I can't get them.
And if you can give me, like...
just a couple...
- Good morning.
- Hi. And I'm here. Okay.
So I'll call...
I'll talk to you later. Bye.
You look like you're
in worse shape than I am.
What happened to you?
I fell down some stairs and...
- Are you okay?
- Well, do I look okay?
No, not really.
Well, I'm better than I look.
Here, I got you a coffee.
I didn't...
I didn't know how you took it.
Black's fine.
- I added cream.
- That's okay.
- No, here, have mine. No, I insist.
- No, really...
What is it?
Well, it's just that
this has cream in it too.
It's milk.
Good.
Okay, well, I'll...
I'll get to work.
What?
What is it?
What is it that gives a
schoolgirl her special innocence?
Is it the way they smell?
The sweet smell
of their perfume, of their hair?
The aroma of fresh flowers...
and all that other stuff
that hasn't been fucked up...
by late nights and a lot of bad food.
Is it their gestures...
and the way they move?
The way their body still holds on to
some semblance of self-respect and...
and dignity?
When they wrap their
beautiful legs around you...
tight and holding on,
looking at you...
you looking at them.
It's just...
Or is it whatever comes out
of their cute little mouths?
All those questions,
all that wondering that...
It's just, you know, you...
They got their whole lives
ahead of them, you know?
And you've wasted half of yours away.
Damn.
What is it?
There's this feeling
I get sometimes, you know?
What sort of feeling?
That I wasn't ever meant
to be satisfied.
Satisfied with what?
A lot of things.
I mean, it seems to me that
every time I'm about to...
you know, get a hold
of something or someone...
it's just bound to slip away.
Maybe you want it to slip away.
Maybe I want what to slip away?
The things that you think
you're about to have.
What would you think about that?
As a general philosophy...
or how it pertains to you?
You think you could talk
about how it pertains to me?
What do you mean?
Well, I feel like I want you.
Do you think that means
you'll slip away?
Dad?
I'm not going to baby-sit
for Uncle Francis anymore.
Baby-sit?
You go there to practice.
That's absurd.
Why?
Dad, he pretends I'm still
baby-sitting for him.
Why would you think that?
Because he's paying me.
To house-sit.
Twenty dollars an hour?
When did it go up?
He wants to believe
that Lisa's still there.
I make it easier for him
to convince himself.
Francis always had strange
ways to convince himself...
of many things.
Things that never happened,
things that might happen.
People who did things
for reasons, but they didn't.
What has any of this
got to do with me, Dad?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
So why do I have to keep going there?
You don't.
And you'll tell him?
I was in here the other night
when that guy was thrown out.
Why did that happen?
Has he ever been thrown out before?
- Why do you think he would touch you?
- Why do you think he would touch you?
Why do you think he would touch you?
Well, what do you think was
going through his mind when he...
Or-Or what was he thinking?
- Well...
- What's so funny?
Well, this is a joke, right?
Not at all.
If you do this favor for me,
I'll do that favor for you.
But I'm not hiding anything.
Thomas, you're hiding
a smuggling operation...
that brings in over $200,000 a year,
probably a lot more.
We've suspected you for a long time.
I was just brought in to
confirm what was already known.
So how do you want me to report back?
All I'm asking for is a bit of help.
That's all.
It's very important for me to know these
things. Just ask her these questions.
Do this for me,
and you have a clean slate.
This really hasn't been my day.
So change things.
Make it your day.
And all you men sitting
near that stage, I can see you.
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that "because I'm
sitting next to that stage..."
I'm getting the same feeling
as all those guys...
"shoveling out that cash for
their own private dancer."
Well, you know, you guys want
to watch, go to the movies.
We're in the live-action
business here, gents.
And, okay, granted...
Granted, that beautiful creature
writhing before you on stage...
she maybe, you know,
smiles at you.
She winks her eyes at you
occasionally...
and you may feel like the man.
Is that all you guys are looking for?
Is that all you want?
Come on, come on.
Invite one of our lovely ladies over
to your table where the real action is.
- Yeah!
- Hi.
I'm really sorry that took so long,
or I took so long.
- Hi.
- It's such a busy night.
Hi. I'm Chrissy.
Hi. I'm Thomas.
It's nice to meet you, Thomas.
I like the name Thomas a lot.
Oh, thanks.
Are you from out of town?
Yes.
Where are you from?
San Francisco.
You're kidding.
I love San Francisco.
You've-You've been there?
Yeah, I was there a couple of
years ago with my debating team.
Debating team?
That's-I admire
someone who can debate well.
I mean, who can debate
instead of just argue.
Well, anyone can argue, but it's
a good skill, discipline...
to be able to debate and stand back.
And that's something you
can apply in your life...
outside of school.
And, and when you're meeting
someone or negotiating.
Negotiating?
Well, I mean, if you have...
If you have to...
It's a good skill to learn,
as opposed to cheerleading or...
Well, that's what I say.
Don't be nervous about this, Thomas.
- We're gonna have some fun, okay?
- Sure.
Sure.
I was here the other night...
What night was that?
The night th-that guy was thrown out.
You were dancing for him.
His name is Francis.
What happened?
He was a bad boy.
- Wh-What do you mean by that?
- What do I mean?
I mean, have you danced
for him before a lot?
- And has he ever been thrown out before?
- No.
So what do you think happened?
He touched me.
And when you're dancing
for the customer...
they can't touch.
Yes, but why do you think
he touched you last night?
Has he ever touched you before?
Is this what you really want to talk
about for five bucks a dance, Thomas?
Well, I just want to know what you
think was going on in his mind.
Are you here for some kind
of psychology conference?
Well, yes.
I am, actually.
He's...
He's a very particular case.
Particular in what way?
You want the full story?
Sure.
His daughter was murdered
a couple of years ago...
and then he was implicated.
- For th-the murder?
- Yeah.
- But why?
- I don't know.
I don't really remember the details.
I mean, he was cleared, and then
they caught the guy who did it.
But... it obviously had, like, this...
this incredible effect on him.
I mean, he is...
He's just so fucked up about it.
You know...
Thomas...
Francis and I have a very
special type of relationship.
And I've never-I've never minded.
But then he chose to violate it.
S-Special in what way?
Well, we've, we've always
had this understanding.
I mean, I need him
for certain things...
and... he needs me for certain things.
I mean,
that's the way it's been.
And how did he violate that?
He-He violated that in his-his, in his
role and what he was supposed to do for me.
Wh-What's he su-Why?
What's he supposed to do for you? I
mean, he comes to this club. He pays you.
Because I was doing things for him...
and he's done things for me.
What has he done for you?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
Okay, this is really stupid.
And then I'm getting so emotional
over the fact that he touched me...
because, I mean, he was,
he was always paying me...
to do him this favor and...
- What favor?
- I don't know, Thomas.
- Why do you want to know all this?
- Well, I'm sorry, but I...
What is it about a schoolgirl that gives
her that special innocence, gentlemen?
Such a thing that you have
absolutely no control over.
You never have.
And you never will.
After this break, we'll be
right back with sweet Chrissy...
He's not supposed to do that.
- Who'll help us answer that question.
- Do what?
He's not supposed to...
He's not suppose...
He can obviously see from his booth that
I'm sitting here talking with a client.
He's not supposed to call me
when I'm talking with a client.
Why? Do you have to go now?
Yeah.
But I want to come back,
and I want to, you know, talk.
But I want to move downstairs.
I don't like it here.
Sure, sure, sure.
Okay. I'll see you soon.
I'm going to move to the washroom.
Hey, I've noticed you've been spending
a lot of time with that lady.
Are you-Are you talking to me?
Yeah.
You seem to... to both
hit it off together.
- Well, I guess.
- Yeah.
I guess that can happen.
So what do you guys talk about?
Just things.
What sort of things?
Oh, this and that.
"This and that"?
You know, it's amazing how...
you can hit it off with
someone like that, isn't it?
Have you ever noticed that some
people just drift into your life...
like you've known them forever?
I mean, there are some people
that you can remember...
the moment that you met them
really clearly.
And other people that...
it seems like you've known them forever,
even though you haven't.
And they all become part of this
continuous memory you have of yourself.
This ongoing...
Are you with me?
Yeah, I think so.
I mean, here you are,
y-you know...
you're having this beautiful
conversation with her.
You're getting to know each other, and...
I mean, there's other guys
that come in here.
There's this one guy who comes in here
every other night or something...
and he spends a few hours with her.
But he never really
gets to know her, you know?
Not the way you have.
Not the way you two...
She really seems to be herself with you.
Well, how do you know?
What? That she's being herself?
Yeah.
Because I used to be her lover.
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't let you in.
Look, why not?
Look, can I... Can I at least
just talk to the manager?
- You want to talk to the manager?
- Yeah.
You have to understand that
we have very strict rules...
regarding this sort of behavior here.
- And I have always respected them.
- And this one time you didn't.
Now, the problem, Mr. Brown,
is that this one time...
happened in a room full of
other men who were watching.
Now, if I let you back into the club...
what's to stop them from
trying to do the same thing?
I told you.
Someone told me to do it.
I was set up.
And you believed that someone?
- This is Security.
- Please, sit down.
Thank you.
Why did you touch her?
- Well, I needed to make sure.
- Why?
What if she let you?
What would you have done?
I'd have been disappointed.
I'm not sure...
I understand you.
That's not the way she was raised.
You know her? Personally?
There is another club I can recommend.
I need to come here.
- I understand that very well.
- No, I don't think you understand.
Exotica is a special place.
My mother was dedicated to creating a
very particular type of atmosphere...
and I would like to maintain that.
You don't understand.
Mr. Brown, we're all aware
of what you've gone through.
You've suffered a lot.
But you have to understand that
Exotica is here for your amusement.
We're here to entertain,
not to heal.
There are other places for that.
Other places?
I can give you a list.
Mr. Brown?
Are you listening to me,
Mr. Brown?
I just met this man in the washroom.
What man?
Well, I'm not sure.
I was in a booth.
I didn't really have
a chance to see him.
- So how did you meet him?
- He just started talking to me.
And what did he say?
Well, he said
he used to be your lover.
Well, it's always
a sad moment, gentlemen...
when that clock
strikes that magic hour...
and we have to send you out into
the long and dark and lonely night.
But just remember...
we're only ever just a dream away...
wherever that is.
- I guess...
- I have to go.
Oh, okay.
Wait a minute.
- Oh, no. Thomas, don't.
- No, no, no.
- Thomas, please, don't.
- No, no. I insist.
Please.
Thank you.
Your dad told me about...
you not wanting to baby-sit anymore.
There's no baby to sit.
Well, I just want you
to know, I understand.
Understand what?
That this might all seem a little weird.
A little?
- I just want to thank you, Tracey.
- For what?
You've been very patient.
And...
if you think the time has come for
this to end, then I understand.
Thank you.
Good night, Francis.
He-He-He calls me from a table to dance.
Of course I expect you to do something.
Christina...
And then-and then he follows this guy
to the washroom...
and he tells this guy
that, that he was my lover.
Well, he was.
It's going too far, Zoe.
Actually, baby, you have
no idea how far it's gone.
You know,
I told him to touch you.
I said you were into it. Yeah.
It used to be wonderful
watching you dance for him,
seeing how you could soothe him.
I mean, it soothed me.
You know, you soothed me.
Do you understand that?
- Hey, hey.
- Don't, don't, don't!
- Stop. Stop that!
- Don't fucking touch me, you fucker!
- Stop!
- Just fuck off, Zoe!
- Stop it when I say! Eric!
- Stop it!
Chill out! Chill out!
Chill out! Relax!
- All right? Relax!
- Eric, come here!
- John! Get out. What's the matter?
- No!
Fuck off, Zoe! No!
Morning, Thomas.
- What happened?
- I had to leave.
Did you hear everything?
Yeah.
Did you know?
Did I know what?
That she knew...
about your daughter.
You know, when the,
when the police came to question me...
they told me a lot of things.
They told me that my wife was
having an affair with my brother;
Had been for years.
They told me that I thought
Lisa wasn't my daughter.
They told me I thought she was Harold's.
Wh-Why would they say that?
Because they thought I could harm her...
that I would harm her.
And then they found the man
that... that did it.
Let me go.
And I went home.
And then my wife was killed in a
car accident a couple months later.
And Harold was in the car.
He lived.
What do you think it would have taken...
for your father to kill someone?
I'm asking because there's
someone that I want to kill now.
I felt it last night as I
listened to him in the washroom.
I don't understand.
He set me up... to touch her.
Why would he do that?
He took something very special from me.
I've had too many
special things taken away.
- That's why we have to go back tonight.
- To kill him?
What would you do, Thomas?
What would you do?
Well...
- Well, I would talk to him.
- I can't even get in there.
What would you do?
You go back tonight...
and you have her dance for you...
and then you touch her.
And he'll throw you out
just like he threw me out.
But I'll be waiting outside
with the gun.
I'm not gonna help you kill somebody.
Not even to save a few years in prison?
No.
Well, to help me then?
And that was Mirella,
gentlemen. Mirella.
You can have her at your own
table for only five dollars.
Thank you, Mirella.
And now, it's always a pleasure to
announce to you our next dancer.
Gentlemen, please, let's give
a big round of applause...
for Christina.
Don't be afraid.
I know everything about you.
What do you know about me?
I found her.
You found who?
Your little girl.
I found her, man.
I found her.
Yeah, play something happy.
Play something happy.
Yeah. Hello.
Okay, I'll get it,
I'll get it, I'll get it.
- Hi, Christina.
- Hi.
- I'm a little bit early.
- Yeah, th-that's okay. Come on in.
Yeah, I mean,
it's difficult for me to tell...
'cause I never had much of a
musical education myself...
but her teacher thinks
she's really talented.
And actually, we were thinking
of buying her a better piano.
An exotic baby grand, you know?
And when I mentioned "baby grand,"
do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Dad,
isn't that a contradiction in terms?"
I mean, she just never
ceases to amaze me.
I mean, she's eight years old.
Can you imagine?
She can already identify-
Wh-What do you call that when...
it's two words,
kind of cancel each other out?
She just amazes me.
Where's your mind?
I was just thinking.
About what?
About the way you talk about Lisa.
You get so excited.
It's nice.
Well, I'm sure your parents
talk about you that way too.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do.
Why?
Because you're a very
responsible young woman.
Responsible to what?
Well, to whatever it is
you believe you have to do.
Like what?
Well, Lisa loves it when you come
over to baby-sit, for example.
She says you really listen to her.
That's nice.
She really listens to me too.
She thinks you're not very happy.
Listen, Christina,
if there's, if there's ever
anything you want to talk about...
about what might be going on
at home or whatever...
you know that I'm here, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, no. It's okay.
Thank you.
You know, I really enjoy
these drives home, Mr. Brown.
Good, good. So do I.
- Bye, Mr. Brown.
- Good-bye.
