Jody, Time To Go.
Oh, Aren't You
Excited?
Get His Bag.
Thanks For
Your Help, Sister.
There You Go, Son.
See You.
Bye.
Good-Bye, Dear.
Say Thank You
To Sister.
Thank You, Sister.
Let Me Get
One More Shot.
Ok.
Bye-Bye.
Good-Bye, Dear.
One Day, The Great King
Of The Silver Baboons
Came Down From A Peak
High On A Mountaintop
In Kilimanjaro
And Caught Your Father
Stealing His Treasure
From A Deep, Dark Cave
From Which Enchanted Rubies
Spilled Out Down
The Mountainside.
After A Great Battle
With The Baboon King,
Your Father Was Badly
Wounded And Left To Die.
But When The Baboon King
Found Out
That Your Father Wanted
The Enchanted Rubies
To Cure His Son...
Sister, Adam's
Not Breathing!
Children, Children,
Move To The Side.
Adam!
Is He Dead?
Did He Hurt His Head?
I Don't Know.
They Just Said
He Wasn't Breathing.
Well, He's Breathing Now.
Call Sister Kathryn.
I Will.
Adam...
Adam...
Adam.
Don't Give Up On Us.
Don't You
Give Up, Child.
Don't You Break
Our Hearts.
Oh, Adam...
I've Tried So Hard
With You.
That Poor Little
Heart Of Yours...
I Don't Know
What Else To Do.
Oh, Adam.
Caroline...
Caroline?
Um... Yeah.
I Can't Do Anything
Right Now.
What Do You Need?
Aren't You Going To
Get Something To Eat?
Um, Later.
## I Am Sitting
In The Morning##
## At The Diner
On The Corner##
## I Am Waiting
At The Counter##
## For The Man
To Pour The Coffee##
## And He Fills It
Only Halfway##
## And Before
I Even Argue##
## He Is Looking
Out The Window##
## At Somebody
Coming In##
Mmm!
## It Is Always
Nice To See You##
## Says The Man
Behind The Counter##
## To The Woman
Who Has Come In##
## She Is Shaking
Her Umbrella##
## And I Look
The Other Way##
## As They Are Kissing
Their Hellos##
## And I'm Pretending
Not To See Them##
## And Instead...##
Hi.
Hi.
I Missed You.
You Missed Me?
Mm-Hmm.
Since What,
Yesterday?
Yeah. Why Not?
Aren't We Going?
Yeah.
Is Anything Wrong?
No.
What Do You
Want To Do?
I Thought We Were
Going To The Game.
What's The Matter?
Steven?
You Want To Just...
Go Some Other Time?
You Don't Want
To See Me Anymore.
No.
I Didn't Say That.
I- It's Just...
I Don't Know.
Maybe We Should Just Start
Seeing Other People.
This Always
Happens To Me.
Why Does This
Always Happen?
I Let Myself
Get Involved,
I Wind Up
Getting Hurt.
Caroline...
What Did I Do
That Was So Wrong?
Don't Say That.
You Didn't
Do Anything.
It's Me. I Just...
I Don't Know.
It's...
Uh...
E...
Come Here.
No.
Caroline...
Come Here.
Come On.
Oh...
Don't Cry.
Don't Leave Me.
Oh...
Ah...
I'm Going Inside.
Why Don't I
Call You Later?
No. Don't.
Just Leave Me Alone.
Caroline...
I Didn't Mean
To Hurt You.
Yeah.
Well, You Did.
Did He Tell You Why?
No.
He Just Said We Should Start
Seeing Other People.
He's A Jerk.
He Could've At Least
Told You Why.
Forget It.
I Don't Feel Like
Talking About It Anymore.
Talk About What?
Steven Broke Up
With Caroline Today.
Steve...
The One
With The Fig Tree?
No. That Was Jackie.
Steven Had
The Sick Mother.
No. That Was Bob.
His Mother
Got Better.
That's When
He Dumped Me.
So Jackie
Had The Fig Tree?
No. That Was Mike.
Mike.
I'm Going
To Call Him.
Caroline,
Don't You Dare.
My God, The Guy
Broke Up With You.
You've Got To
Let Them Call You.
Anyway, This Guy
Is A Jerk, Ok?
You Watch.
I Bet He's Going
To Come Crawling Back
On His Knees Saying,
"Oh, Caroline, I Miss You.
I Want You Back."
Yeah.
Like They All Do.
You're Too Good
To These Jerks.
Put Your Foot Down.
You Got
Too Good A Heart.
If You Let Them
Walk All Over You...
Ha. What Scares Me
Is When Someone
So Screwed Up
Doesn't Want Me.
Ladies, We're
Getting Busy.
You're Taking
Too Many Breaks.
Come On.
He Whistles At Us
Like We're Dogs.
Does He Ever
Go Home?
All Right.
I'm Going.
I'm Going!
I'll See You
Tomorrow Night.
Working Tomorrow
Night, Hon?
Yep.
I'll Be Here.
Ok.
Know What?
Walk Safely Home,
Ok?
There's A Lot Of
Crazies Out There.
I'll See You Later.
Caroline?
He's A Jerk.
## Right From
The Start##
## The Start##
Adam, Clean Up
On Table 7.
Adam...
Adam!
## Something
That's Inside##
## Just A Little Girl##
## A Little Girl##
## Who Still Loves You...##
And Held Off
The Hard-Charging Redwings...
Uh...
Ohh...
Here They Come,
You Guys.
Hey, Chip,
Congratulations.
Thanks, Buddy.
Hi, Jody.
How's Your Dad?
Come On In.
There's Cake,
Ice Cream, Champagne.
Make Yourselves At Home.
John, Where The Hell's
My Tuna Melt?
I'm Working On It.
Well, Work Harder.
This Guy's Having
A Heart Attack Over Here.
Can You Send Adam
Over To Table 5?
Thank You.
Ok.
Oh, Great.
No, Wait. That's Cindy's
Tuna Melt.
It's All Right.
Here You Go.
Finally.
Here You Are.
Caroline?
Here You Are.
Yes?
Where's Adam?
I Don't Know.
Tell Him
To Get Out Here.
Wait. Let Me
Get A Picture.
Hey, Caroline.
Not Now.
Oh.
Adam,
You Cut Yourself.
Let Me See.
Oh, My God,
This Is Pretty Deep.
You Might
Need Stitches.
Hold It Like This.
I'll Put
A Bandage On It.
You...
Oh, Keep It Up
Because...
You Know What? Let Me
Wash It Off First.
I Want To
Rinse It Off.
If It Doesn't
Stop Bleeding...
Well, Maybe Jim Can Take You
Over To The Hospital.
Ohh.
Oh...
Sorry, Sorry,
Sorry, Sorry.
Ohh...
What Do You Have
All Over Your Hands?
Is It...
Syrup Or...
Sap.
You Work At That
Christmas Tree Lot
During The Day,
Don't You?
Yeah, Yeah,
I've Seen You There...
Hauling Trees
Once Or Twice.
You Smell
Like A Pine Tree...
Like A Christmas Tree.
Maybe I'll Stick A Star
On Your Head, Huh?
Just Kidding.
I Used To Love How
Our Christmas Tree Smelled
When We Were Little.
Ahh, Brings Back
Memories, You Know,
When Life Was Simple.
Now My Parents Put Up
This Stupid Artificial Tree.
It's All Fake.
Just... Not The Same,
You Know?
You Just Don't
Talk Much, Do You?
Don't Worry. I'm Not Going
To Make You Talk To Me.
Could I Have
A Waitress, Please?
Whoo.
Ahem.
You'll Live.
I Got To Get
Back To Work.
Thanks.
Come On...
Why Don't You Go Over There
And Handle It?
You Can Do It.
Hey.
How'd You Like
To Pay For That Machine?
It Just Stole My Damn
Quarter, Sweetheart.
'Cause Guys Like You
Always Pound On It.
What's With You?
It Ain't Your Machine.
Actually, It Is,
So Don't Hit It Anymore.
Thank You.
This Your Diner?
No. Just My Machine.
Just Wait.
It Happens To Be
A Very Good Investment
Once It's All
Paid Off.
Now, What Brand?
Marlboro.
Lights.
Uh, 100S, Please.
Heh Heh Heh.
Here.
That's Great.
Come To Me
Next Time.
We Will.
How'd You Like
To Feel That, Huh?
Heh Heh.
She'd Make A Meal
Out Of Ya.
You Know Her?
Don't You Remember
Who That Is?
No. Who Is She?
Ah, Well, Just Wait.
You'll See.
Hello. Do You Fellows
Know What You Want?
Yes.
We'd Like To Have
Caroline Wait On Us...
If You Don't Mind,
Because...
We're Going
To Tip You Both.
Yeah.
Thank You.
Switch With Me.
Those 2 Guys
In There...
They're Asking
For Caroline.
Great.
That's For Bill.
Ready To Order?
Yeah. Hi.
So, Have You Been To
Any Parties Lately, Caroline?
Do I Know You?
Well, I Tell You,
I Know You.
Dean Alabanasi's
4Th Of July Party...
In The Basement...
Sloe Gin Fizzes?
Ohh.
Yeah.
How's It Going?
Well, You Know.
It's Going.
Oh, Yeah,
Yeah, Yeah.
Now I Remember.
God, That Was
Embarrassing.
Ah. Ha Ha.
Good Memory.
It's My Pleasure.
Must Have Been
Barfing Up Stuff
Your Grandmother
Ate That Night.
I'm Not An Ogre
That Lives Under
The Cigarette Machine.
Forget It,
All Right?
Because We All
Are Just People Here.
Hmm? You Know?
Ok.
We're Not So Bad.
My Name's Howard...
In Case
You've Forgotten.
This Here's Patsy.
Hi.
Cigarette?
No.
Oh, Yeah. Ok.
Um...
I Tell You What,
I'm Going To Have
A Cheeseburger Deluxe,
And Make That
Medium Rare.
And She's Yelling
At The Top Of Her Lungs,
"You Motherfucking,
Lousy, Filthy Pig.
"Your Mother's A Slut,
And Your Father's
A Ho'."
All Of This
Right In Front Of
The Sons Of Italy Hall.
This Girl...
No Class.
You Got A Light?
Mmm!
I Mean,
He Met Her
At A Stop Light.
You Know?
She Looks Like
Pete Rose.
You Going To Commiserate
All Night Again, Ladies?
You Are Like
Wet Sand...
In My Underwear.
Ouch.
Anyways...
Did You Call Him?
No.
Really?
That's Good.
That's
Real Good.
Here.
Finish My Cig For Me.
I Got To Grab This Guy
Before He Stiffs Me.
Talk To You Later.
Why Not Pay Me Now
So We Don't Have
To Worry About It Later?
## Blue Moon##
## You Saw Me
Standing Alone##
## Without A Dream
In My Heart##
## Without A Love
Of My Own...##
Whoo!
Hey, Honey!
Hey, Caroline!
God, You Scared
The Shit Out Of Me.
Sorry.
You Always Drive
Like That?
I'm Really Sorry.
No More Tables?
Hmm?
Got Any Burgers?
This What You Guys Do
At 4:00 In The Morning?
Here. Warm You Up.
Come On, Caroline.
Get Inside.
No, Thanks.
Come On. Hang Out.
We've Been Kicked Out Of
Every Bar In Minneapolis.
Nah. I'm Going Home.
Home?
Yep. Going Home.
It's Late.
Late? This Is Early
For Us.
Be Careful!
Wahoo!
Hey, Caroline,
Hang On A Second.
Mind If We
Walk With You?
I'm All Right.
It's Late Out.
Pretty Girl Like You?
No. Really.
I'm All Right.
Good Night.
Hey, Uh, Listen.
I Got A Question
I Want To Ask You.
How Much Can We Get One Of
Those Cigarette Machines For?
Patsy And Me, We Was
Thinking Of Getting One.
Yeah.
Uh, I Think
About 1,500 Used.
That's What We Paid.
Yeah, Really?
1,500, Huh?
Huh.
Come On.
Take A Shot.
No. I'm Really Tired.
I Worked All Night.
I Got To Get Home.
Come On. We Ain't
Going To Bite You.
Hey, Um,
You Ain't Scared
Of Us, Are You?
No. I'm Just Tired.
Oh, Yeah.
That's Right, Because...
You Worked
All Night, Right?
Hey, Caroline.
Do You Like To Fuck?
Is This Yours?
Just Leave Me Alone.
Here.
Take It.
Go On, Take It.
No?
You Forgot Something.
Caroline, Where'd You
Go Off To, Honey?
I Got Your Hat.
It's Right Here!
Hey, Maybe She Wants
The Cherry Brandy.
Yeah, Yeah.
Caroline!
Here.
Go Up That Way.
Go That Way.
Go Find Her.
Caroline, Honey.
Hey, Come On.
It's Ok.
It's Ok.
Calm Down.
No!
Come On.
It's Ok.
Come On. Here.
Aah!
Aah!
Oh, God!
Jesus!
My Nose...
Aah!
Oh.
Jesus!
God!
Aah.
Where You Going?
Trying To Get Away
From Howard?
Ohh...
Oh!
How-Man, Look
Who I Found.
Aah...
I Think
You Broke My Nose.
Gmmb!
I'm Sorry. What?
I...
Uh...
Good.
Good?
Huh?
I'll Show You Good.
Hey...
Caroline,
Tell Me Something.
Did You Really Think That
You Were Better Than Me?
Did You?
Huh? Shh.
You Ok?
How-Man, What
Are You Doing?
Patsy,
I'm Quieting Her Down.
Shh.
Here, Give Me
Your Hand.
Ohh.
See, Caroline.
See That?
I Hurt.
Quiet. Patsy,
Get Her To Be Quiet.
Shh.
Aah!
She Bit Me!
Aah!
Ah, Damn!
Aah!
Shut Up.
No!
Come On. Yeah.
Baby... Yeah.
Aah!
Shut Up!
Take It Easy,
Howard.
Shut Up.
Aah!
Shut Up!
Jesus, Howard.
What The Hell
Are We Doing?
Oh!
Aah!
Oh!
What I Like To Do
Is Take A Little
Pork Rind
And Smear That
On My Lure.
You Know, I'd Recommend
The Rat-Lipped Jig.
The Problem
With A Rat-Lipped Jig
Is That It
Sometimes Catches
On, You Know, Underwater
Growth And Stuff.
Well, I Know, But...
Oh, Come On.
Try It.
Cindy, Where's Caroline
Again Today?
Uh,
She Called In Sick.
Called In Sick?
That's Every Day
This Week.
She Ok?
She Called In Sick.
If She's Sick,
She's Sick.
What Can I Tell You?
Anything Serious?
Yeah. She's
Sick Of Work.
Wasn't This
A Private Conversation
Between You And Me,
Bill?
Don't Worry About It.
I Think She Got The Flu
Or Something.
She'll Be In Tomorrow.
Hey. Here You Go.
Merry Christmas.
What Would You
Like
For Christmas?
A Doll House.
Ok. Good.
Huh? We'll See You
Christmas Morning, Huh?
Merry Christmas.
Hi There.
What Would You Like?
Ok.
I'll See You Later.
Michael, Don't Forget.
Pick Me Up At 2:00.
2 A.M.?
Yeah.
I Have To Get Up
For School.
You Wanted
The Car Tonight.
Don't Make Me
Wake Up Daddy,
Because
I'll Kill You.
Hey, Caroline.
Welcome Back.
Thanks.
Hey, Caroline.
Where You Been?
Just Been Out.
You Missed All
The Action Here Last Night.
Oh, Yeah?
What Did I Miss?
You Remember
Bobby Las Vegas, Don't You?
With The Motorcycle?
Yeah, Except He Don't Ride
The Motorcycle No More.
Yeah? What Happened?
Slid
On A Dead Squirrel
Going Around A Turn.
Demolished The Bike.
Jesus.
He Was In Here
Last Night.
He Got Drunk As A Dog
Down The Street.
He Tried To Run Through
Lowry Hill Tunnel,
Except He Passed Out
Halfway Through.
They Brought Him
In Here.
He Was In The Bathroom
Throwing Up All Night.
Yeah. I'm Really
Sorry I Missed That.
Yeah, Only Bobby, Huh?
So, Caroline,
Those 2 Guys,
You Know?
That Were Bothering
With The Machine
The Other Night
Last Week.
Yeah.
Jim Seen One Of Them
Over At St. Vincent's.
I Went Down There
To See My Cousin Lucy.
Remember, She Had That
Thing With Her Wrist?
Anyway, I See Him
Out In The Hallway.
Man, Was He Worked.
His Face Was A Mess...
Black Eyes,
Bumps, Bruises.
Looked Like He Was Hit
By A Dump Truck.
I Got To Pick Up Lucy
On Tuesday.
Come Here.
You've Been
Following Me Home?
How Do You Know
Where I Live?
Huh?
Have You?
Well? Have You?
How's Your Hand?
Thank You.
I Know.
That's As Scared As I've
Ever Been In My Whole Life.
I Get Squirrels
In My Stomach
Thinking About It.
Guess I Don't
Have To Worry
About You Telling
Anybody, Huh?
It's Kind Of A Real
Awkward Thing For A Girl.
Well...
Don't Take This
The Wrong Way...
But Thank You.
I Follow You Home.
You Follow Me Home?
I...
What?
I Wasn't Finished.
Finish.
I Follow You Home
And...
Walked...
Make Sure You're...
Safe.
I've Never Seen You.
I Stay
Pretty Far Behind.
I'm Sorry.
Well...
I Mean, Don't Be Sorry.
I Just...
I Wasn't Finished.
Finish.
I'm Sorry That...
I Was Late...
That Night.
I Don't Think
I Ever Heard You Speak,
And When You Do,
You Apologize To Me
For Saving Me Against...
Oh, God Knows
What Could Have Happened.
Why Should I Be
Surprised, Right?
My Life Is Like Watching
The Three Stooges
In Spanish.
I'm Either Being Dumped
Or Being Attacked.
Don't Hit The Machine.
I'm Sorry.
I Don't Even Know
What I'm Saying Anymore.
I'll Talk To You
About This Later.
And I Brought
Your Coat Back.
## Bad, Bad Boy##
## Uh-Huh##
## Yeah, Uh-Huh##
## Yeah, Uh-Huh, Uh-Huh##
## Yeah, Uh-Huh##
## Yeah, Uh-Huh, Uh-Huh##
## Bad, Bad Boy##
## Come With Me,

## And Feel Protected##
## This Time
I Want To Go Away##
## Uh-Huh##
You Sure
You're All Right
To Come Back
To Work, Hon?
Been Looking A Little
Puffy These Days.
You Sure It Was The Flu
And Not Something Else?
I'm All Right.
Just Checking.
What Do You Think
About Adam?
I Think
He's Very Weird.
Wonder What
He Thinks About.
I Don't Think Adam
Actually Thinks.
I Mean,
We're Talking
About A Man
Who Hasn't Spoken.
So?
So...
You Don't Find That
A Little Weird?
Look At Him.
He Looks Like A Tumor
Sitting Over There.
And His Hair.
Oh, God.
It Just Bothers Me
So Much.
You Know, Lottie Says
That He Has
Ape Parts In Him
Or Something Like That.
I Don't Know.
My God. Lottie?
What A Story.
Well, Whatever.
Too Bad, Though.
He Is Kind Of Cute.
I'd Do Him,
If He Just
Wasn't So Dumb.
## Uh-Huh, Uh-Huh##
## Yeah, Uh-Huh##
## Yeah, Uh-Huh, Uh-Huh##
So What Are You
Doing For Christmas?
Uh...
The Usual.
Grandparents Coming Over,
Sitting
In Front Of The TV,
Looking
At The Stupid Tree,
Giving Me $10,
Asking Me Where
My Boyfriend Is.
Oh, Hon.
It's All Right To Feel
Shitty This Time Of Year.
You Know,
Everybody Does.
It's Like,
This Is Life.
And When You Go
Through It Long Enough,
You Know
What The Flavor Is,
And It Sure Ain't
Vanilla.
## Uh-Huh, Uh-Huh##
## Yeah, Uh-Huh##
## Yeah, Uh-Huh, Uh-Huh##
## Bad, Bad Boys##
Why Don't You Come
Over For Christmas?
My Daddy's Always Saying,
"What's Wrong With Caroline?
"She Misses Us Or What,
Or She Hates Us?"
We'll See.
We'll See, Huh?
We'll See.
You Know, I Knew
You Were Going To Say That.
Just Forget
The Whole Thing.
You Know,
Just Forget It.
You Got A Problem.
You Really Got To Learn
To Follow Through
With Things.
I Mean, You Never
Finish Anything You Start.
I Finish.
Oh, Yeah?
Did You Finish
Beauty School?
I Got A Practical Exam
In 2 Weeks.
Yeah? What About
The Flower Shop?
What Happened
To The Opening?
Mm-Hmm. Mm-Hmm.
You Know What,
Caroline?
Let Me Give You
Your First Lesson.
Why Don't You
Finish This, Cousin?
Bitch.
Wench.
Slut.
Douche Bag.
You Better
Do Your Sugars
Before I Sic Jim
On You.
Jim!
Jim! Caroline's
Screwing Off Again!
Jim!
Hi.
Can Always
Measure Your Tips
By Your Sugar Jars.
Come 3 A.M., I See
Empty Sugar Jars,
I Know
I've Got Good Tips.
You Like Hockey?
Hmm?
Ever Been To A Game?
No.
Maybe We Could Go
To A Game Sometime.
You Took
My Bandage Off.
It's Ok.
It's Ok. It's Ok.
Bye.
31/2.
I Thought The Food
Was Creative.
I Liked Their
Roast Dishes.
Yeah.
Me, Too. Yeah.
If My Brother
Ever Shows Up,
Tell Him I'm Going
To Kill Him.
If You Look Up
Long Enough,
You'll See
A Shooting Star.
Oh.
They're Not
Really Stars.
They're Meteors,
Actually.
Really?
Falling To The Earth.
You Can See Them Good
From This Bridge.
Huh.
There's The Big Dipper.
There's The North Star
And Venus.
Come On. I Want
To Show You Something.
All Right.
Uh, What's This?
It's Ok.
This... This Is
Where I Live.
Oh.
Oh.
This Is My Dog.
Hi. Hi.
Good Dog.
What's Her Name?
I Don't Know.
He Never Told Me.
I Don't Mean
To Be Rude To You
In Your Own Place,
But You Are A Little
Strange Sometimes.
Would You Like
Some Ice Cream?
Ice Cream?
No, I... No.
You Read
All These Books?
I Don't Sleep
Very Well.
Got A...
Cosy Little Apartment.
You...
This Is From
Last New Year's Eve.
Did You Take This
From Behind The Counter
At Work?
I Better Get Going Home.
Oh...
Thanks For Everything.
Uh...
Well, Tomorrow's
Christmas Eve,
And I Don't Work
The Day After That, So...
Merry Christmas.
Ow!
What?
## Christmas Always Comes##
## This Time Of The Year##
## Little Girls##
## And Little Boys##
## Dream Of Worlds
Full Of Toys##
## This Time Of The Year##
## When Christmas Is Near##
## Evergreens##
## Are Snowy White##
## Sleigh Bells Ring##
What The Hell
Happened To My Tree?
## Through The Night##
Michael! Caroline!
## This Time Of The Year##
Caroline!
## When Christmas
Is Near##
Oh!
## And Somewhere##
## Near A Steeple##
## People Kneel And Pray##
## And Choirs Sing##
## Carols Of Christmas Day?
## Santa Claus##
## Is On His Way##
## Loads Of Joy##
Adam!
## On His Sleigh##
It's Caroline!
## This Time Of Year##
## When Christmas##
I Brought You
Some Cookies.
I Made Them.
## Is Near##
Did You Have A Nice
Christmas Yesterday?
Can I Come In?
Great Weather.
What Do You Think?
Would You Like
Some Ice Cream?
You're On The Ice Cream,
Aren't You?
No, Thanks.
Well, I Guess
The Cookies Are A Little
On The Sugary Side.
So, Uh...
You Were All Alone
For Christmas.
I Should Have
Stopped Over Yesterday.
I Should Have
Invited You Over.
But, Uh...
Guess You Were
Already There.
Thank You
For The Tree.
It's So Beautiful.
It Really Made My Day
That You Remembered.
Is This A Bad Time?
Do You Want Me To Go?
No.
Ok. Then I'll Stay.
I'm Not Even
Going To Ask
How You Got
Into Our House.
Do You Like Music,
Caroline?
Mm-Hmm.
I Never Heard You Say
My Name Before.
It Sounded Nice.
Would You Like To See
My Records, Caroline?
Caroline?
Sure.
Wow.
They Look Really Old.
They're Magic.
Yeah, Magic.
What Kind Of Magic
Do They Do?
In The Orphanage,
Mother Camilla Used
To Play Them For Me.
I Used To Sit
In The Sunlight
Near The Window
In Her Office,
And I'd Fall Asleep
To Them.
She... She Gave Them
To Me When I Left.
Whenever My Life
Doesn't Agree With Me,
I Lie Down, And I Play
These Records, And...
The Rain Stops Falling.
Would You Like
To Hear One?
Mm-Hmm.
You Must Have...
Loved Her A Lot...
Mother Camilla.
She...
She's The One That Told Me
About My Heart.
What
About Your Heart?
I Was... I Was
A Very Sick Baby.
My Heart Was Very Weak.
My Mother, She Died
When I Was Born.
She Died In The Jungle
Where She And My Father
Were Living.
In The Jungle?
My Father Was
A Great Adventurer.
Mmm.
One Day...
The Great King
Of The Silver Baboons
Came Down From His Peak
High In The Mountaintops
Of Kilimanjaro.
He Caught My Father
Stealing His Treasure
Out Of A Deep, Dark Cave
At The Very Bottom,
Where Magic Rubies
Trickled Down
From The Top
Of The Mountain.
After A Terrible Battle
With The Baboon King,
My Father Was Wounded
And Left To Die.
And The Great King
Later Learned
That My Father Needed
The Enchanted Rubies
To Heal His Son
With A Dying Heart.
He Was So Overwhelmed
With...
Guilt And Shame
At What He Had Done,
He Took His Own
Beating Heart
Right From His Mighty
Baboon Chest,
And He Placed It In Mine.
Mother Camilla
Told You All This?
And You Believe Her?
And You Tell This
To People?
Oh, No.
It's A Nice Story.
It Stopped Raining.
Magic Records
And A Baboon Heart.
You Almost Got Me
Believing In It.
How'd You Like Me
To Cut Your Hair?
It's Ok.
No One's Home.
Mind If I Ask
Who Cuts This Thing?
I Do.
I See.
Mind If I Ask
Something Else?
Ouch.
Sorry.
Did You Ever Think
Of Doing Anything Else
With Your Life
Besides Busboy?
I Mean, You Must Have Had
An Education At The Orphanage.
I'm... Not Very Good
With People.
Oh, Don't Let People
Stand In Your Way.
The Only People Are
Just Like You And Me.
Well...
Maybe Not Like You.
I Don't Know If I've Ever
Met Anyone Like You.
Mmm.
The First I Can Remember,
I Was 4 Years Old...
And?
I Wasn't Allowed
Any Physical Contact Or...
Even Allowed
To Go Out In Public.
Why?
My Health
Was Still Poor.
Just The Risk
Of Infection...
People Were So Used
To Staying Away From Me
That They Always
Stayed Away.
I Never Got
Close To People.
Jeez, That's Got To
Be Hard On A Kid...
Not Being Held
Or Being Allowed
To Hold Anyone.
Well, What Does
Your Father Do?
Uh...
Uh, Actually,
My Step-Dad.
"Step To The Rear."
He's A Bus Driver.
Mtc Between Minneapolis
And St. Paul.
A Really Good Guy.
You Should
Meet Him Sometime.
He Was On
Candid Camera once.
They Locked Him
In A Closet.
He Was Really
Great About It.
My Real Dad Is Like Oil
And Vinegar With Everybody.
He Just Don't Mix.
Cindy Says
Screw Him.
Well, First Guy
To Walk Out Of My Life.
Certainly Not The Last.
Weird, Huh?
You're Always
Staying Away From Love,
I'm Always
Chasing Love.
Weird.
Come On.
Come On.
Here.
Are You Crying?
Oh. Ok.
It's Ok.
I'm Going To Fall
In Love With You.
You Don't Have
To Love Me Back.
I'm Going To Give You
My Heart.
Ok?
Ok.
Um, My Parents Are Having
A New Year's Eve Party.
Uh...
My Brother Will Be There
With Whoever Might Be
His Girlfriend At That Moment.
Do You Want To Come?
You Don't Have To Come
As My Boyfriend
Or Anything Like That.
Uh...
Though I'd Like You To.
Is That A Yes?
Mmm. Yes.
Yes?
Say Yes Again.
Yes.
Yes?
Yes, Yes, Yes,
Yes, Yes.
Nice Kitty.
Nice Kitty.
Bye.
Adam...
What Are You
Doing Out Here?
When Did You
Get Here?
10:00.
10:00?
That Was Almost
2 Hours Ago.
You'd Rather Be
Out Here With My Cat
Than Inside With...
With A Roomful Of
Strangers And Relatives?
Adam.
Ohh, Ohh...
"Star Light,
Star Bright,
"First Star
I See Tonight,
"I Wish I May,
I Wish I Might
Have This Wish
I Wish Tonight."
That's Mars.
What?
That's Mars.
You Just Wished
On A Planet.
Partygoers:
5... 4... 3...
2... 1...
Happy New Year!
## Should Auld Acquaintance
Be Forgot...##
You Can Kiss Me.
Oh, Adam.
Girl: I'm Going
To Get A Soda!
You Know Nick's Friend
Ronnie, He's A Cop?
No.
Yes, You Do.
His Sister Bought The House
Down By North Shore?
I Never Met Him,
Though.
Anyway, Look.
I Want You To Double
With Us.
We're Going
To The Fountain.
You Know... Go Dancing,
Have Some Fun.
Mmm...
I Don't Think I Can.
Why Not?
Well, I'm Sort Of
Seeing Somebody.
Yeah?
You Are?
Who?
Come On,
You Little Shit,
Tell Me Who!
Oh, Forget It.
It's Adam.
Adam Who?
Adam From Work.
Adam Adam?
And You're Just Telling Me
This Shit Now?
You Freakin' Liar.
I'm Not Lying. It's Adam.
Uh-Uh.
Why?
'Cause... I Got To Know Him.
And We Make Sense.
What Do You Mean,
"We Make Sense"?
He Doesn't Make Sense,
I Don't Make Sense.
Together, We Make Sense.
So...
Tell Me
What He's Like.
I Mean, Does He
Actually Speak?
Did You Meet
His Family Yet?
I Mean,
What's Up With This?
Yeah, He Speaks.
No, I Haven't
Met His Family.
He's An Orphan.
Really?
No Shit?
I Never Met A Real
Orphan Before.
Yeah.
He's A Lot Smarter
Than People Think.
He Reads A Lot,
Got A Lot Of Books.
He's Really
Into His Music.
Really?
He's Really Sweet.
He's Like A Kid,
But It's Nice.
He's Got...
He Thinks He's Got...
He Thinks He's Got
A Baboon's Heart.
You See, Caroline?
You See?
I Told You This Man
Had Ape Parts In Him.
I Told You!
He Doesn't Have
Ape Parts In Him.
It's Just A Story One Of
Those Nuns At That Orphanage
Told A Scared Little Boy.
He's Got Some Kind
Of Heart Problem.
But Adam?
You Don't Have To Sell
Yourself Short, Either.
Well, There's Something
You Don't Know.
What?
You Know When
I Was Out Sick?
Yeah.
On The Way Home
In The Park One Night,
2 Guys
Tried To Rape Me.
Oh, My God.
Oh, My God.
Caroline,
Are You Ok?
Yeah.
Someone Stopped Them.
It Was Adam.
He Saved Me.
Why Didn't You
Tell Me This, Huh?
Why... Why Didn't
You Come To Me?
I Didn't Tell Anybody.
Jesus,
You Poor Thing.
Are You All Right?
I Mean Seriously,
Are You Ok?
Yeah?
God, I Don't
Believe This.
Oh, Shit.
Shit, Shit, Shit!
What?
What?
You're Going
To Be So Mad At Me.
Why?
Well, I Kind Of
Told Nick
That You Would
Double With Ronnie.
I... Great.
Thanks A Lot.
Ohh...
Look, You Don't
Have To Go, Ok?
I Mean, You Can Just
Forget The Whole Thing.
Just Forget It, Ok?
Well...
Well, Go Anyway, Ok?
Just Go, Caroline.
I Mean, You'll
Have A Good Time.
His Father Owns A Hardware
Store Downtown, You Know?
And When Was The Last Time
You Went Dancing, Huh?
And Look,
If You Don't Like Him,
If He Doesn't Turn Out
To Be The Glass Slipper Man,
You Don't Have
To See Him Anymore.
I Don't Know.
My Dad Owns
A Hardware Store.
What?
My Dad... He Owns
A Hardware Store.
If You Ever
Need Anything...
What?
If You Ever Need Anything,
Just Let Me Know.
I'll Take Care Of It.
Looks Like We Don't Have
To Wait For A Seat.
Cindy.
What?
Can I Talk
To You?
Nick, Go Find Us
A Table.
Ok.
What Is Wrong
With You?
Cindy, I Didn't Want
To Go Out With Him.
I Didn't Know
We Were Coming Here.
This Is Terrible.
Let's Just Go.
Let's Just Go.
Why?
Why Don't You
Just Go Tell Adam
That You're
With Friends?
You And Me
Went Out Dancing,
And That's All.
What, He's Got That Much
Hold On You Already?
No, That Isn't It.
He's Very Sensitive,
And I Don't Know How
He's Going To React
To See Me
With This Guy.
Why Don't You
Just Go Find Adam
And Tell Him That You
And Ronnie Are Just Friends?
All Right?
Well, Go Ahead.
Jim, Where's Adam?
I Don't Know,
Look In Back.
John, Is Adam
Back Here?
No. I Haven't Seen Him.
Adam?
Adam?
Just Coffee.
Are You Sure?
Ok. Have Fun.
There's Caroline.
Here. Sit.
I Ain't Going
To Bite Ya.
Man.
Come On, Get Up.
Get Off Me!
Take This,
Tough Guy.
All Right!
Loser.
Ohh.
Uhh!
Whoo-Hoo!
Oh, My God.
Jim!
Jim!
Woman:
What's Going On?
Oh, My God.
Adam...
Cindy!
I'm Right Here.
I'm Right Here.
Call An Ambulance.
Call An Ambulance!
Is He Breathing?
What Happened?
Has He Been Shot?
I Don't Know.
Somebody Check
The Parking Lot.
Man:
I Got It.
Nobody There.
I'm Right Here.
Right Here.
You're Going
To Be Ok.
It's Not The Knife Wound
That We're Worried About.
It's His Heart That
We're Concerned With.
His Heart?
Yes. It's Not The Normal
Heart Of A 26-Year-Old Man.
Excuse Me.
What Did You Say?
We Know He Has
A Congenital Defect,
And We Do Favor,
At Some Point,
A Transplant.
It's Been Left Untreated
For Far Too Long.
He Should Remain Stable
Until A Proper Donor
Is Available.
How Long
Can That Take?
That We Don't Know.
He's Sedated Now,
But He Became
Very Upset Before
When We Were
Talking About
Going In To Relieve
The Pressure On His Heart.
It Took 2 Orderlies,
2 Nurses, And Myself
To Hold Him Down.
Frankly,
We Were Surprised
That Didn't Kill Him
Right There,
What With All The Trauma
This Evening.
However, That's A Very
Good Sign Of Hope...
That's He's More
Than Strong Enough,
And He Can Go On Living
For Quite Some Time
With Treatment
For What He's Got.
Good Evening.
Are You With
The Lady In There?
Oh, Yes.
She's My Best Friend.
Ok.
Number 5
And Number 7.
You Positive?
Number 5
And Number 7.
Thank You, Miss.
Step Over Here And We'll Get
The Paperwork Out Of The Way.
Uhh.
Uhh.
You're Not Taking Off
Too Much, Are You?
Nope.
I Only Wanted
A Trim.
Did You Hear Me,
Young Lady?
Yep. I Heard You.
You Told Me.
I Can't Believe
I Got To Do This Today.
I Got Too Much
On My Mind.
I Can't Take
This Friggin' Lady.
I Know. Just... Just
Try To Calm Down.
You Can't
Work Miracles,
So Just
Do What You Can.
Hang Tough.
I Know You're
Being Tested Today.
I Hope You're Not Trying
To Impress Anybody.
A- All I Want Is A Trim.
It's Too Cold Out Yet
For Short Hair.
Mm-Hmm. Just Keep
Your Head Still.
Should We Maybe
Involve Your Instructor
In This,
And She Could Make Sure
You Don't Make
A Disaster Area
Out Of My Hair, Hmm?
Uh, Why Did You Stop?
Y- You're Not
Butchering It, Are You?
I... I Wouldn't Like
To Have You Butcher My Hair.
Lady, I'm Not
Butchering Your Hair.
It's A Free Hair Cut,
All Right?
Stop Bitching Before
I Cut It All Off,
You Fat Cow!
Oh, Thanks!
What?
Cindy, Can You Drive Me
Over To The Hospital?
I Don't Have A Car,
Nobody's Home,
And I Really Want
To See Adam.
When Do They Open?
Oh, I... I Don't Know.
Never Mind. He's Here.
Adam!
Oh! Oh... Oh...
What Are You
Doing Here?
I'm Sorry.
I Didn't Mean To
Upset You, Caroline.
Ohh...
Oh, I Was So Scared.
You Ok?
Are You Ok?
Come Inside.
You Want Me To Get You
Something To Eat?
You Want Some Breakfast?
Your Stitches,
Your Stitches.
Uhh.
Oh, I Bet
You're Sore.
Wait. I'm Supposed To
Be Giving You Flowers.
They're Beautiful.
Ohh...
What Did
The Doctor Say?
I'm Not Allowed To Stick
Knives In My Stomach.
Very Funny.
You Could Have
Been Killed.
They Caught The Guys
Who Did It To You.
Do The Police Know
What They Did To You?
Yeah.
I Told Them.
We'll Probably Both
Have To Go To Court.
Did You, Uh, Have
Your Beauty Exam Today?
Yeah, But...
It Just...
F- Forget It.
It Was Just
A Stupid License.
I Was No Good
At It, Anyway.
Don't Say That.
So...
The Doctor Told You
You're Going To Have
To Have A Transplant?
Adam.
No. They're Wrong.
The Heart You Have
Is Diseased.
No One Is Taking Away
My Heart.
You Were Just A Kid.
It Was Just A Story.
You're Going
To Die Someday
If You Don't Do
Something About It.
This... This Is My Heart.
I Don't Want You To Die.
I Love You.
I Was...
I Was Wondering
If You Think About Me...
Of Course
I Think About You.
I Wasn't Finished.
Finish.
I Was Wondering
If You Think About Me...
Half As Much
As I Think About You.
I, Uh...
Have To Tell You
Something.
It Might
Make You Angry.
Look At Me.
I Watch You
Sleep Sometimes.
The Tree, It Wasn't
The First Time
I Was In Your Room...
Or The Last.
You Come Into My Room?
From The Basement
Under The Porch.
To Watch Me Sleep?
Why?
'Cause You Have Peace.
I Don't.
My Sleep, It's Always
The Same Dream.
A Jungle...
Dreary, Twisted Limbs...
Strangling Vines...
And Rain.
Always The Rain.
I Feel Suffocated...
Despair.
Despair Just Trying
To Survive.
Despair And No Peace.
I'm...
Afraid If They Take Away
My Heart, I...
I Won't Be Able
To Love You The Same.
You Are My Peace.
Oh, My God.
You Love With Your Mind
And Your Soul,
Not Actually
With Your Heart.
It's Just A Saying.
Why Does It
Hurt So Much Here
When You're Not
With Me?

Happy Birthday!
Come Here.
You Look Beautiful.
You Get This.
You Get This.
And You Get This.
Go Get Your Coat.
Where Are We Going?
It's A Surprise.
What's That?
What?
It's A Present
For You.
For Me?
Yeah. Don't... Don't...
Don't Open It.
It's A Surprise.
We Can Open It
Later Together.
You Got... You Got Me
A Present On Your Birthday?
Oh!
Come Here.
I Have Fallen...
Did You
Hurt Yourself?
I Wasn't Finished.
I Have Fallen
So In Love With You,
So Much More Than
I Told You I Would.
All Right.
We're Here.
Ok.
Come On.
Take It Out!
Come On,
Take It Out!
Clear It Out!
Clear It Out!
Clear It Out!
Yeah!
Oh!
Come On!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
He Caught The Puck!
I Don't Believe It!
Oh!
He Did It!
Whoo!
Hey!
North Stars!
North Stars!
Yay!
Yay!
I Can't Believe
You Caught A Puck.
That's, Like...
It's, Like,
Never Happens.
That's,
Like, Amazing.
You're Amazing.
Thank You
For Taking Me, Caroline.
I Didn't Know
If You'd Like It.
You Know What I Like.
I'm Glad You Like It
As Much As Me.
I Love Hockey.
Ha Ha Ha!
You Didn't Even Know
What A Power Play Was.
I Know, But The Next Time
We Go, You Can Tell Me.
I'll Catch Another
One Of These For You.
It Was
A Good Game, Huh?
Yeah.
Good Game.
Mmm...
Hey.
Baby...
Wake Up.
We're Home.
Hey.
Wake Up.
Wake Up.
Sweetie.
We're Home.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh!

I Love You, Too.
Luck Has Nothing
To Do With It.
Hmm.
He Was Like An Angel,
You Know?
I Never Knew Life
Could Be Like That.
He Was The One Thing
I Followed Through With
In My Life.
The One Thing
I Didn't Give Up On.
I Was Good
At Loving Him.
Ha...
Oh.
