This had better not be a stag film.
What's in this movie?
- I wanted to watch it ahead of time.
But he said it'd spoil the emotional impact.
A real show man, that one!
You haven't seen it? You're the principal
We're showin' it in your school.
What if he is some kind of huckster?
- Oh, no, no Mr. Mayor.
This guy's on the up and up.
He works with some federal agency.
Federal ? I guess it's okay, then.
Exactly what I thought.
Maree...
Maree -jew -wanna.
Maree -jew... jew ?
Maree...
Excuse me. Do you know how to say this ?
I don't speak Mexican.
Good evening.

Over the years
your Benjamin Harrison High School
has hosted numerous functions,
Graduations, for example,
Your annual Christmas pageants
The Drama Club's recent and so I'm told,
highly lauded presentation
of Green Grow the Lilacs.
But no purpose this room has ever served
is more important
than that which brings myself
and my able assistant Mr. Blumsack
to your community tonight.
I assume worthy parents like yourselves
have photos of your kids in your wallets.
right ?
Could you take them out and look at them ?
Fine looking young lad.
My, she's the spitting image,
isn't she?
You all looking carefully? Good.
For those pictured before you
could be the targets of a deadly assassin!
An assassin of youth!
A new drug menace, destroying our
children in alarmingly increasing numbers.
Marijuana, is that drug !
A violent narcotic,
An unspeakable scourge.
The real public enemy number one.
CREEPING LIKE A COMMUNIST,
IT'S KNOCKING AT OUR DOORS!
TURNING ALL OUR CHILDREN
INTO HOOLIGANS AND WHORES!
VORACIOUSLY DEVOURING
THE WAY THINGS ARE TODAY
SAVAGELY DEFLOWERING THAT GOOD OLD U.S.A.
IT'S...
REEFER MADNESS,
REEFER MADNESS!
REEFER MADNESS, REEFER MADNESS!
OH SO MAD!
SEE THE KIDS,
PRECIOUS KIDS,
YES, THEIR HEADS ARE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK
CAN'T IGNORE ANYMORE

WITH A DEADLY STICK OF REEFER
IN THE HAND!
HEADING STRAIGHT FOR...
- REEFER MADNESS, REEFER MADNESS!
REEFER MADNESS, REEFER MADNESS!
SAVE OUR KIDS!
STEALTHY AS A SOCIALIST...
IT SLITHERS UP OUR SHORES.
TURNING ALL OUR CHILDREN
INTO HOOLIGANS AND WHORES.
THIS SMOKING BOWL OF EVIL,
THIS SMOKING BOWL OF EVIL
IT BURROWS LIKE AWEEVIL
UNDER TENDER CHRISTIAN SKIN! YES!
REEFER MADNESS, REEFER MADNESS.
REEFER MADNESS, REEFER MADNESS!
OH SO MAD!

MADNESS, MADNESS, MADNESS, MADNESS,
REEFER'S MADE US CRAZY
BARKING - MAD!
Some of you may think I'm overreacting.
- I'll say! I think
You've come to the wrong town, pal.
- That thing isn't a problem around here
you don't know our kids!
You'd be surprised how often I hear that.
What makes this particular drug
so dangerous, is that there are
No forbidden needles
or snorting powders ?
Children smoke a reefer stick!
Thinking it to be an ordinay,
perfectly harmless cigarette.
The kind we all enjoyed as teenagers.
And before you can say
Jack Robinson, they are enslaved!
But don't take myword for it,
hear the shocking,
sordid facts, and judge for yourselves.
The filmed presentation
you're about to witness,
chronicles, The Harper affair.
A true stoy,exhaustively documented
in the fine newspapers of
Mr. William Randolph Hearst
A true stoy, that took place
in a tow
vey much like your own.
Meet Jimmy Harper, a young lad
of some sixteen summers.
Well mannered, hardworking,
an all around credit to the community.
Right now, Jimmy's hurying to school,
Hoping to run into a vey special
young lady, Mary Lane.
Mary was a healthy young miss
of good American breeding stock.
God fearing, civic minded and
vey much in love.
Just a harmless old turtle. See?
Off you go.
I thought it was a rat.
Mary I cary your books?
Yes, Mary and Jimmywere destined,
to share a love
that would last a lifetime.
Tragically, it would be the brief
lifetime of a fruit fly.
It's sweet of you to help me
study Romeo and Juliet.
Without your help, come exam time,
I would've been on a trip for biscuits!
Well it, it's my pleasure.
Ah, where would you like to start?
Probably the Pru-low-gwee.
Pru-low-gwee.
I think you mean prologue.
I got that confused with Mon-tay-gwee.
That's not even a real word.
I looked it up in two dictionaries.
Montague. It's Romeo's last name.
You are so smart.
My mother says
you're a boy who's going places.
you talk about me to your mother ?
I talk about you to eveybody!
Forsooth, fair Juliet. Wouldst thou
likest yon hot chocolate?
Wherever did you learn
to speak like that?
It's fancy talk.
From Romeo and Juliet.
'Cause, when a guy wants to, woo a girl,
he needs you know, the right language.
Are you tying to woo me, Jimmy Harper ?
I NEED WORDS TO TELL YOU
'BOUT MY POUNDING HEART:
FOUR DOLLAR WORDS
THAT MAKE A GUY SOUND SMART.
WELL I GUESS THAT'S WHY
THEY INVENTED SHAKESPEARE
HIS ARTICULATIONS OF A LOVER'S
PALPITATIONS ARE SO KEEN.
MY BOUNTY IS AS BOUNDLESS AS THE SEA!
MY LOVE AS DEEP THE MORE I GIVE TO THEE.
OH YOU SOUND SO DREAMY
WHEN YOU TALK LIKE SHAKESPEARE!
A BIG VOCABULARY SHOULD BE
CUSTOMARY WHEN YOU FALL IN LOVE...
LA LA LA LA LA LA YOU'RE A SNOWY DOVE.
LA LA LA PRODIGIOUS BIRTH OF LOVE.
LA LA LA HIP HOORAY FOR SHAKESPEARE!
SURE AS I AM BREATHING,
YOU CAN MAKE
ELIZABETHAN LANGUAGE FUN
WE ARE JUST LIKE ROMEO AND JULIET.
WE'RE HAPPY, YOUNG,
AND BUBBLING WITH LOVE.
I CAN'T WAIT, TO READ THE ENDING!
I CAN'T EITHER!
BUT I'M SURE, IT TURNS OUT REAL SWELL.
I BET ROMEO, MARRIES HIS JULIET.
AND THEY HAVE A BABY.
AND MAKES LOTS OF FRIENDS.
THAT'S PROBABLY THE WAY THE PLAY ENDS.
YOU DOTH TEACH THE TORCHES
HOW TO BURN REAL BRIGHT.
HANGING LIKE A JEWEL UPON
THE CHEEK OF NIGHT.
HARK WHAT LIGHT
THROUGH YONDER WINDOW BREAKS HERE?
WILL BE FUTURE SPOUSES
PUT A PLAGUE ON BOTH OUR HOUSES
IF WE'RE WRONG. SHAKESPEARE!
The sad truth is,
That if our schools spent
less time indoctrinating our children
in the works of, Bill Shakespeare,
and focused instead on the work
of a far superior author...
things might have turned out differently.
And the delicate heart
of young love
might not have been stabbed.
Stabbed, and pinned, to the shameful
corkboard of, the reefer den!
Come on, Mae! Get up off your duff!
What time is it Jack?
Time to give this place a goin' over.
It looks like the Marines have landed.
That bunch last night was high
Party's over Sally.
What a night.
I was in more laps than a napkin.
Great, now the damn baby's awake.
Hold your water!
Momma's coming.
Damn stairs.
Look at all this weed!
Pastures of plenty!
Keep your ham-hooks off my product!
Just checking for bugs!
We need a better class of clientele.
he's old enough to know what he's doing.
Not like those kids you bring up here.
Ah, stop squawking at me!
You got more static than the radio.
I'll press bricks over to the Five & Dime
Bring back a couple more kids.
You got a problem with that?
Well maybe I do!
You better tune me in
and get my signal right.
Around here, I call the shots.
Jack!
Almost forgot.
Can't get through the morning
without a little toot, can you?
See you in the funny papers.
I OUGHTA LEAVE HIM.
BUT SOMETHING MAKES ME STAY.
IT'S THE STUFF.
I'D TRY TO KILL HIM,
BUT MY GUY GIVES ME LOVE
AND THE STUFF.
SOMETIMES HE'S ROUGH.
HE THROWS ME DOWN THE STAIRS.
BUT DEEP INSIDE HE CARES!
HE BUYS ME LINGERIE.
AND STUFF.
I WAS A STUDENT.
GOOD GRADES AND SO NAIVE.
'TIL THE STUFF.
A HANDSOME STRANGER,
SOME EMPTY PROMISES,
LOTSA STUFF.
BUT I DON'T GET HOOKED.
I'M NOT ADDICTED, NO!
I JUST ENJOY THE GLOW!
I LIKE TO HAVE MY FUN!
NO HARM TO ANYONE.
THOUGH THE FUN SOMETIMES ESCAPES ME,
WHEN JACKS GETS STONED
AND RAPES ME!
NOTHING NUMBS ME BETTER THAN...
THE STUFF.
THAN THE STUFF.
In the latest issue of Scientific American,
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics tells us,
that marijuana,
posses an addictive power beyond
even that of heroin, or cocaine.
Yes?
Are you sure about your facts there ?
No, no. Shh. Shh.
Why do you ask, mister...
Kochinski.
my wife's cousin had himself
a problem with the heroin.
And I'd done some readin', there's
nothin' more addictive than that stuff.
Kochinski.
Russian name.
Isn't it?
It's Polish. Actually, it's Polish.
Of course.
I certainly applaud your brave,
unwillingness to believe something
simply because it's printed in a magazine
with the word "American" in the title.
You stand as a shining examplen
to your comrades.
And the rest of us.
My wife,
mighta mixed up the stoy.
I think it was marijuana
that her cousin was hooked on.
It's bad, it's bad stuff.
Bad stuff indeed.
Would that it had been, mere heroin.
For ladies and gentlemen,
marijuana is an insidious master.
Seeking slaves
not in the dark jungles of Africa
But right here!
In each of our 48 states.

Do your children enjoy, jazz music?
For I am here to tell you that,
Cab Calloway, Dizzy Gillespie,
Duke Ellington and the whole
weed blowing, ginger colored lot,
merely masquerading as musicians
and are in fact agents of evil.
Reefer slows down the smoker's
sense of time. Allowing him
to squeeze in unnecessay "grace notes,"
giving this voodoo music the power...
To hypnotize white women into
indulging in
acts of unspeakable degradation.
You will find this profane music,
whereveryou find marijuana.
Hear that? It's the national anthem
of Sodom and Gomorrah.
Faster, Sally, faster!
Put it in me!
Faster, Sally! Faster! Faster!
Ah!
Oh!
Man, I'm starving.
We got any eats?
Eveybody take it on the heel!
Get the lead outta your shorts!
Damn cowbell!

Ralph. Used to be a college boy.
Mae, this is Jimmy Harper.
He's o-kay.
Oh Jack, this kid can't be more than 15.
Oh, 16, madam.
The name's Mae. And a madam
runs a different kind of house.
Shut up!
Good baby.
Say,
Say, who's the new fish?
Oh.
I'm J_immy.
Sally, why don't you and J_immy,
get better acquainted.
Give him the usual.
If I can't turn him on,
he ain't got switches.
How tall are you anyway?
five feet nine inches.
Let's forget the five feet
and concentrate on the nine inches.
Whoopsie!
No harm done. Hero.
I want that Jimmy kid outta here.
He's too young. I got hooked at that age
and I'm not doin' it to anybody else.
Do I have water in my ear
or are you giving me guff?

I was wondering ifwe could practice
our steps for the presidential dance ?
It's only a few days away,
and with you being so mysteriously busy
I wanted to make sure
we could get in enough rehearsal.
Jimmy, is something wrong?
Why?
Should something be wrong?
Stop hounding me!
Stop hounding me!
I didn't think I was.
Oh.
It's me, isn't it?
You don't love me anymore
You haven't even tried to kiss me
in almost a week!
A kiss? Is that what you want?
Let me show you a few new moves...
That was your tongue!
Jimmy Harper! What's come over you?
Mercifully, Mary had no idea
what had come over Jimmy.
But she feared the worst.
THE SERMON TODAYWAS REALLY EXCITING.
YAHWEH WAS MAD

AND LITTLE GREEN FROGGIES.

THUNDERED DOWN FROM THE SKY.
I REACHED FOR YOUR HAND LIKE I ALWAYS DO.
BUT BESIDE ME WAS JUST...
AN EMPTYWOODEN PEW.
THERE'S HYMNALS AND A ROSARY

Welcome to Club Celestial.
I am your host, Joan of Arc.
No Christian martyr works it harder.
The many voices in my head tell me we have

Tonight, Jimmy will be taught
the error of his ways.
By the brightest star in our
Heavenly Firmament
the Lord of Hosts,
The Stranger from the Manger...
the hardest working man
in the afterlife!
Give it up, for Jesus!
Jesus, I got a great high cookin' here.
Don't bring me down.
On the contrary Jimmy.
I'm here to bring you up. With dope.
Oh, not your brand of dope,

You think those reefer fiends are cool?
I don't think you realize
how cool God can be.

You still got a chance.
Why do you gotta steak on your eye?
Just fell, that's all.
I'm serious Jimmy.
It's dangerous here.
I got me a taste for danger!
No!
Back off! You're heaped to the gills.
And you, zip it! You'll wake Sally's baby.
That's okay, Mae. Don't wory about it.
Sally.
I haven't heard your baby cying tonight?
Um!
I don't know.
It is a matter of public record,
that the addict will sell anything,
anything at all, to obtain
the decadent rush, of that next fix.
You'll take good care of him, right?
I mean, it's not true what they say
about you people eating babies, is it?
Care to stay for, dinner?
You didn't really sell your baby
for reefer money, did ya?
It's okay.
I got another one on the way. Light?
that kindajoke, that ain't...
So where'd you get this Packard ?
I boosted it. From my girlfriend.
Girlfriend ? You expect me to believe
some little bobbysoxer's got
what it takes to chop your suey?
I'm steamed up like a pant's presser!
That's the idea baby. Tonight you and me
are gonna break out like the measles!
Sally! Sally!
keep your eyes on the road, Sally!
Serves him right
Hey mister! Ah, are you okay ?
we didn't see you there.
I think

I was never here.
Okay.
Damn lamp-post.
I'm so sory.
I'm so, sory.
THERE'S BLOOD ON MY HANDS
AND MUD ON MY NAME.
MY ID THREW A PARTY
AND EVERYONE CAME.
MY INNOCENCE RAVISHED,
MY VIRTUE DEVOURED.
I CAN'T COUNT THE STRANGERS
WITH WHOM I HAVE SHOWERED.
I'VE TAKEN A LIFE,
BEEN STRIPPED TO MY ESSENCE.
AND TO THINK ALL I WANTED
WAS SWING DANCE LESSONS.
Police! Freeze!
Police looks for a late model Packard,
left the scene of a hit and run homicide!
Mae was right about the Mary Jane.
It owns me.
MARYJANE, OH MARYJANE.
YOU CRUMPLED ME LIKE CELLOPHANE.

MARYJANE, OH MARYJANE.
YOU'VE CONQUERED ME LIKE CHARLEMAGNE.
PLEASURE INTERTWINED WITH PAIN.

I'VE BEEN STAPLED AND SPINDLED.
MYWILLPOWER'S DWINDLED.

Who can name for me the one all abiding,
all powerful force, in the world ?
Principal Short?
What is the human condition
so powerful, it can stave off
all that is black and evil,
in these confusing times?
Love?
In a time, in which our children
are subjected to a daily diet of depravity
in their film and popular music?
In a time, in which
the entire world
is aligned against
the American way of life?
A time when our economy
is in a state of total collapse and a
reckless lunatic sits in the White House,
I am relieved to hear
our fatuous friend is so confident
that love will cary the day.
The correct answer is
of course, vigilance.
Sirens!
There's somethin' I want to give you
and I may not get another chance.
Oh Jimmy! Your school ring ?
Is your finger swollen?
Are you putting on weight?
Maybe. I seem to be hungy all the time.
A moment on the lips, forever on the hips!
Wait!
What do you mean not get another chance ?
I have to run away. Far away!
Well then I'm coming with you!
You have no idea what I've done. -
It doesn't matter.
I'm wearing your school ring now...
as soon as you get it offyour finger!
And if Romeo has to run away,
then so does Juliet!
Okay. Pack a bag. I'll wait.
I believe in you Jimmy Harper!
Even if you do have pudgy fingers.
Goodbye, Mary.
You deserve better.
Hey kid.
How's tricks?
How'd you find me?
It's all over the radio.
Cops are looking foryou and the Packard.
I drove 'round 'til I found it.
I can't have you tellin' the cops
where you get your stager-leaf.
So what say we head back to Mae's,
where it's safe and cozy.
This'll calm you down for the ride.
You're talkin' on a dead phone.
I'm through with reefer,
and I'm through with you.
And don't pull any dirty tricks,
'cause it won't work.
I see.
then there's only one thing left to do:
You like brownies ?
Baked 'em myself.
Well I am kinda hungy.
Thank you.
THIS BROWNIE, IS YUMMY.
IT'S THE GREATEST BROWNIE KNOWN TO MAN.
IT'S CHEWY, IT'S NUTTY.
THIS BROWNIE'S REALLY GOOD! !
DON'T OFFER ME A MACAROON,
MY BROWNIE SUITS ME FINE.
THERE'S FROSTING ON THE TOP
AND BEST OF ALL IT'S MINE!
EAT THE BROWNIE, EAT THE BROWNIE!
EAT THE BROWNIE, EAT THE BROWNIE!
LET'S GO HOME.
OKAY!
I SHIMMER, ELECTRIC.
I'M A ONE-MAN MARCHING BROWNIE BAND.
I LOVE IT, MY BROWNIE.
AND MY BROWNIE LOVES ME TOO!
IT'S SMOOTH, SWEET, IT'S CHOCOLADGE-Y!
IT FORMS A PERFECT SQUARE.
AND THE BESTEST PART OF ALL IS
I DON'T HAVE TO SHARE!
DOESN'T HAVE TO SHARE.
AND THE BESTEST PART OF ALL IS
I DON'T HAVE TO CARE!
EAT THE BROWNIE!
EAT THE BROWNIE!
YEAH!
Come on, kid. Get in the car.

I'm busted flat, Jack.

Oh, not quite!
It doesn't come off
I was saving that ring for May.
Where else you gonna get your fix ?
From the coloreds down the Jazz Quarter?
Those chow-chows over at Madame Ling's ?
They'd bounce you like a lead dime.
Real gold.
Smoke up pipsqueak.
This'll get you through the weekend.
See ya in the funny papers.
He can be a really a nice guy.
What have you gotten yourself into, Jimmy ?
Oh yeah! Hotcha!
Hey diddle diddle, a cat for my fiddle.
One moment, please.
I need the room!
You mind takin' it upstairs ?
Don't mind takin' it an_here.
Hey there. I'm Ralph.
Hello, my name's Mary Lane. I followed
my boyfrriend here. Jimmy Harper.
Have you seen him?
Um, well hejust stepped out. To pick up
some Bibles for our prayer breakfast.
That's my Jimmy.
Say, is this a fraternity sweater ?
Is Jimmy hanging out with college boys ?
Why yes.
Yes, he is.
We at Phi Beta Cannabis, were so taken
with Jimmy that, we decided
to pledge him. Early.
While he's still in high school.
Avoid the rush.
Well that's the bees' knees!
Wait 'til Susie Maybery hears about this!
Let's celebrate
with a smoke.
Hold on!
This isn't that "reefer" I've read about ?
Of course not.
This is a special cigarette.
All the rage with the college girls.
In Paris.
Paris?
Oh, yes.
Well, if I'm going to be dating
a fraternity man.
LITTLE MARY SUNSHINE,
WITH HER HEM CUT SO LOW.
LITTLE MARY SUNSHINE,
WITH HER DUCKS IN A ROW.
It burns my lungs.
LITTLE MARY SUNSHINE,
NEEDS A CHANGE IN HER LIFE.
LITTLE MARY SUNSHINE,
NEEDS A MAN.
Oh!
NOW COME ON, MARY SUNSHINE.
IT'S TIME THAT YOU LEARNED TO BE BAD.
YOU MAKE A CHARMING ARMFUL,
SO SNUGGLE UP, MY BUTTER CUP,
'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN HAD.
Oh Ralph, I think you tricked me.
NOW, SMOKE IT, MARY SUNSHINE.
DISSOLVE IN THE SWEET BURNING GLOW.
COME LOSE YOURSELF IN PLEASURE,
WHEN THE BAMBALACHA'S GOTCHA,
YOU'LL FORGET THE WORD "NO"!
Oh, I can't. What about, Jimmy ?
JIMMY'S A RUBE,
PROVINCIAL AND DULL.
DON'T BE TRICKED,
HE'S STRICTLY QUADRILATERAL.
JIMMY'S A BOY,
I'M READY FOR MEN.
LET'S GO UP AND DOWN
AND UP AND DOWN AND...

WHAT'S YOUR RUSH? YOU'RE NOT HAVING FUN?
MARY.
MARY SUNSHINE.
BURNS FOR, YEARNS FOR DIRTY LOVE!
Shut up bitch!
I'm not buying any of this.
You ask me, this guy's getting his jolly
showing us blue movies.
I'm sory, Mr. Kochinski, do you have
something to share with the group ?
No.
We're interested in what you have to say.
Look, it, it'sjust,
One puff and the girl goes wacky?
It's kinda far fetched. Not according
to Mr. William Randolph Hearst.
A recent edition, of his
"San Francisco Examiner" tells us,
that 314 of the crimes of violence
in this county today are
committed by dope slaves.
That is a matter of cold record.
You can't believe evemhing you read.
and that don't make me a commie!
Mr. Hurst is a man who attended Harvard.
Where did you matriculate?
Ma-tric-u-late?
It means, where did you go to college?
I didn't.
I see.
Well regardless, Mr. Kochinski I'm sure,
we all take your opinions vey seriously.
Given the extremity of your views,
it would be unpatriotic not to.
Mary ?
Jimmy!
Kid! It's not what it looks like.
Holy socks!
Billy, don't go!
Don't you wanna learn to dance?
Jack! Help me!
He's killing me!
Geez ! That stupid little weed freak.
Is eveybody okay?
I think, I've been shot.
She fell down!
Mae! Get me some smelling salts.
Alright. You two blow.
Don't talk to nobody. I will handle this.
Go!
Give me that!
Mary?
Mary! what happened ?
You shot her dead, kid.
Jack, no !
Jimmy? I don't feel so good.
It's, it's gonna be okay. I promise.
feels so, cold.
Give me the ring!
Well, looky here.
Casper milky toast is givin' me orders.
I shot Mary.
What makes you think I won't shoot you?
Oh Jimmy, your school ring.
it glitters. Like a star.
WE ARE JUST LIKE ROMEO AND JULIET.
WE'RE HAPPY, YOUNG AND...
HEMORRHAGING BLOOD.
DID YOU GET TO READ THE ENDING ?
WAS IT PERFECT?
DID THEY LOVE
UNTIL THEY GOT OLD ?
It was beautiful. They grew up,
and eveyone came to the wedding.
did they have babies ?
Yeah. Six of 'em.
That's good. I love babies
IT MAKES ME HAPPY
KNOWIN' THAT WE LOVED LIKE ROMEO AND...
JULIET.
Mary!
How could I have shot you ?
Coppers!
Jimmy! Out the back! Hury!
I have to face my punishment.
Don't you get it?
Jack was holding the gun.
He's planning to frame you.
Nobody move!
Officer, thank God !
This kid burst in here with a gun,
and started shootin' and laughin'!
We think he mighta been
smoking that, reefer!
Just like you read about in the papers.
No! That's a lie!
Tell 'em what really happened Mae!
Ma'am, do you have anything to say ?
Well, I...Jimmy I,
Officer I...
Mae, please !
No.
The kid burst in shooting.
Just like the man said.
Mae ?
No !
Kid's gonna burn for this.
Pity. Attractive girl.
After a swift trial
James Fenimore Harperwas found guilty
of the murder, of Mary Lane.
And sent to death row.
In his thought-provoking book
"Marijuana, Weed of Madness "
Earle A. Rowell explains how marijuana
causes prison inmates to fall
desperately in love with each other.
Just as they would with women,
outside prison walls.
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. America

MY BID TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.
'CAUSE THERE'S BLOOD UPON YOUR NECKTIE,
YOUR CORPUS IS DELECTI
AND I HAVE BEEN DELIVERED FROM THE STUFF!
You've sent Thelma into shock !
Yourwife's lack of fortitude
is no fault of this presentation.
I dare say our hardy pioneer women
would have shared a laugh at her expense.
So what of Mae Coleman ?
With Jack out of the picture, Mae was
determined to rescue doomed Jimmy.
But fate was about to intervene
in a most dramatic fashion.
I see the Presidential motorcade
turning onto Halpern Street.
Mr. President. Ah, Mr. President!
Mr. President,, I need to talk with you !
Step back, ma'am.
It is a known scientific fact,
that under the influence of marijuana,
the user becomes insatiably violent.
capable of staggering feats of strength.
Unfortunately for Mae Coleman...
she was no longer under the influence.
I'm don't...so, terribly sorry.
I don't know what came over me.
Please, help me up.
Mr. President! An innocent boy
is about to be executed! Listen to me!
Hold on boys!
I, for one, would like to hear
what the blood-spattered
young lady has to say.
James Fenimore Harper,
you have been convicted of
the murder of Mary Lane
and sentenced to death
by electrocution
in accordance with the laws
of this great state.
Any last words?
Well put. Pull the switch.
Stop the execution !
We have a Presidential Pardon !
Mae, am I ever glad to see you !
! And you too, Mr. President.
I knew you wouldn't let me die.
I was hoping you wouldn't cut it so close.
I'm sorry kid.
But now we're gonna be okay.
Jimmy, I've heard a lot about you.
and we've read all about you
in school, Mr. President.
I promise never to touch the reefer again.
Oh, that's simply grand!
You know, a little orphan girl
once told me
that the sun would come out tomorrow.
Her adopted father was a billionaire,
so I suppressed the urge,
urge to laugh in her face, but now
I think she might have been right !
THE TRAGIC VICTIM OF DRUG ABUSE
HAS NOW BEEN SPARED FOR A HIGHER USE.
THEYWERE READY TO COOK MY GOOSE,
BUT GOD HAD OTHER PLANS!
