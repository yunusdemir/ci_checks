All Over The Map
<i>Hey, guys.</i>
I just completed the longest
and biggest tour I've ever been on
And I couldn't have done
it without my wife Audrey,
who's travelled everywhere, or
without my friend Jeff Rothpan,
who's never travelled further
than his own mailbox.
Was I little concerned about
doing shows in the Far East,
and Africa, and the Middle East?
No..
I was a lot concerned.
But the adventures
all began in Iceland.

Walter, I'm just impressed
that all these folks
came out for our show tonight?
-Well, don't be?
Why?
-Well, it's Iceland.
It's not you or us.
There's nothing else to do here.
[Laughter]
I know you read up on Iceland
a little bit before we came back
Oh Yeah. Yeah.
What did you read about?
Well, I read...
The volcanoes..
You read about that?
Oh yeah it's great..
Imagine something that
can erupt at any second
and destroy everything in its path
Yup..
I'll be darn
Why?
I married a volcano
-You know that Iceland has
one of the highest life
expectancies in
the entire world?
-I did not know that.
-Especially women.
-Yeah?
-Yeah, here a woman's
average lifespan
is 90 to 100 years.
-Send my wife home immediately.
What is this?
Hell on earth?
All right.
-How do you like the food here?
-Oh, very funny.
What?
I tried some of that--
what do you called that?
Hakharl hacaral hakaral.
You cannot speak Icelandic
without moving your lips,
I'm telling you.
Think of that.
There's no Icelandic
ventriloquist ever.
I will say, though, I think the thieves
uh.. folks of Iceland are geniuses.
-How's that?
-They know how to
keep it from getting
overcrowded with foreigners.
-How's that?
-Simply by naming the place..
Iceland.
It sounds like you'll
freeze your ass off.
Plus it's easier to say than
"The dark long winter land
where the weather is Shit."
We're morons for naming our
country the United States.
Sounds way too welcoming.
We should've called our country:
"Crazy Assholes with guns."
[Laughter]
[Applause]
Did you get a chance
to go to a volcano?
Oh, yes I did.
Did you take your wife?
Yes, I did.
What'd she think?
She kept saying the
same thing over and over.
What?
Stop trying to push me in.
On another subject did you know
that strip clubs are also illegal here?
Really?
Right..
So if I wanna see a naked woman
I'd have to a six hour flight to
Scotland?
Or, There is your wife
Oh that's true. In Iceland its
legal to ...
Whale hunt
That's not nice
So I do an interview with the
Nancy Grace of Iceland
Tough penetrating questions.
How do we face criticism?
We don't care..
Good thing we had to hold our own
microphone. This place is on a budget
Look I don't wanna start a riot
or anything but I want all the..
Hot Icelandic women to know..
I'm easy..
The only problem is
Jeff will have to come along too
I'm.. I'm happily married
Not my problem
-Did you know that every
single city in Iceland
is named after the
sound a cat makes
when throwing up a hair ball?
[Laughter]
I learned that.
-That's not true.
-Oh?
Reygoovableh.
[Laughter]
There it is.
My favourite person in Iceland is a guy
named Half Thor..
He should be called whole Thor..
because he won strongest man
in Iceland and in Europe..
I didn't test him but I believed him
Was little awkward walking
around with the guy because he
Pulls trucks and I...
Have Dolls..
Game Of Thrones
Right?
Yes..
So who do you play in Game Of Thrones?
uh.. The Mountain
The Mountain?
In... in the season.. four.
Well that make sense it wouldn't be good
If you were like the stick
So you the Mountain..
And You are a Viking
I'm a ventriloquist so...
We have nothing in common
No not really..
How far can you actually throw me?
Probably throw to water over there
You wanna try?
No. I don't wanna try
What do you think about Iceland?
uh..
Do they have beer?
Yeah..
My favourite place ever
You know.. Even though it's
named Iceland, did you
know the winters here
are actually fairly mild?
-No.
-Mm-hm.
-Oh.
Guess they should
have called it Chile.
[Laughter]
That's a joke Half Thor
If you eat too much will you be
three quarters Thor?
I did a fraction.
That was good..
-Have you seen the colors
of the Icelandic flag?
-Uh, no, I haven't seen it.
-There's red for
the volcanic fires.
-Oh, that's good.
-Blue for the mountains
in the distance.
-Yeah.
-And white--
-For the people.
[Laughter]
So have you enjoyed being here in Iceland?
I hate the Volcanoes
Why?
Things blowing up naturally..
If this gets popular I'll
be out of a job.
If one goes off while I'm here
I'm taking credit for it
See that pile of smoke and ash?
I did that..
Tada...
[Yodelling]
-OK, did you know that they have
the oldest tree in Norway
right here in Bergen.
-Fascinating.
If I want to see some old
wood, I'll take a Viagra.
[Laughter]
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
-Did you know the first ever
ski jumper was from Norway?
-Let me guess,
married and miserable?
-So you've never
been snow skiing?
-Actually, yes, once.
Broke a leg.
-Oh, I bet that hurt.
-I don't know.
Wasn't my leg.
Norway is all about water
I found a sea captain who agreed to
Help me with the severalties of the language
Can you teach me to say..
Um...
I can't find my room
OK. Forget it
Did you know Norway is a
constitutional Monarchy.
Oh yeah yeah..
It means they have a king..
So its true?
Elvis is alive..
No
Another thing you know you better not
get caught driving drunk
Why?
Well if you caught you have
to spend 30 days in jail
They suspend your license
oh yeah yeah..
And then they fine you 10%
of your annual income..
So that would be 12 dollars..
-Do you know where I can buy
some whiskey around here?
-Well, in Norway you
can only buy liquor
from special stores
called, uh, good god.
[Laughter]
Vin-- how do you say it?
Yeah, that.
-There are none-- nur
none hur dun nur dun.
So do you know about
the midnight sun?
The midnight sun.
Is that Norway's Batman?
No in the summer some parts of Norway
get 24 hours of sunlight..
What?
They have 24 hours of sunlight
Well, That's almost a whole day
-So we've done a lot
of interesting things
while in Norway.
Yeah, This morning I milked a goat.
-Oh?
-Achmed got mad at me.
I think I was
touching his chick.
On another subject I was taking about.
with the Walter that Norwegians
invented skiing.
Oh... really?
Yeah. In Norwegian the word ski
Means piece of wood
Oh..yeah yeah.. piece of wood
Can I speak a Norwegian?
Sure...
Oh Kay.. ummm
That hot lady in the front row
Is giving me a big ski
Heard something else interesting..
Did you know Norway sends Sweden its garbage
To use in its recycling programs
A lot of countries import other
country's garbage..
Canada gave us Justin Beiber.
I was telling one of the other guy
As you know Norway means path to the North
That's interesting cos where we are from
Mexico means:
"Pack your bags and start running north"
All right..
Silence, I kill you..
-So while we're here.
-Wait, I want to
ask you something.
Can we go to Ikea?
-This is Norway.
Ikea is in Sweden.
-Oh, too bad.
I wanted to give Ikea a
new advertising slogan.
-And what's that?
-I-Kea Al-you.
[Laughter]
-So Achmed, did you know the
biathlon is popular here?
-What is this biathlon?
It's where you ski
and shoot a gun.
-Oh! Yes, of course.
But in Los Angeles, you
drive and shoot a gun.
-I also learned today that
the Vikings put their dead
on a boat and sent
them out to sea.
-Yes, of course.
The first Norwegian Cruise Line.
[Laughter]
So we landed in lovely Dublin,
Ireland last night
We landed but none of the baggage did
I got like 29 baggage tags
No clothes, No dummies, No toothbrush,
No Underwear, No nothing
So I'm sure in 8 hours I guess for now
I'm just gonna
walk around and drink Guinness
-So have you learned much about
Ireland since we got here?
Ah I'd say Americans and the
Irish pretty much think alike.
-How's that?
-Most of us think our government
should take flying fucking leap.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
-Well, besides politics, did
you know that Bram Stoker who
wrote ah.. created
Dracula is from Dublin?
-Oh really?
No, I heard..
Dracula , yeah..
Dracula?
You mean the guy who sleeps
all day, goes out every night,
And can't stop drinking?
[Laughter]
[Applause]
Wonder where Stoker
got that idea?
I once picked up an
Irish hitch hiker.
-You did?
-Yeah.
-Where was he going?
-Rehab.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
Have you noticed this is very diverse city?
Yes, Yes.
I saw the black guy.
Good for you
Did you see the O'Connell bridge?
No what's that?
It's the only bridge in Europe that's
as wide as as it is long..
Oh..
I married her
Is it a toll bridge?
No..
Oh..
Well that's another thing my wife
And that bridge have in common
How's that?
No one would ever pay to get on her either
Seems like she is Irish.
[gibberish]
[Laughter]
[gibberish]
-You're not saying anything.
-No, but they can understand me.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
-So what do you think
about Dublin so far?
-Oh, duh, dur, uh, this
is the land of beer.
-That's right.
-I know we're going
to Israel soon,
but while we've
been here in Dublin,
I've seen pubs
everywhere, so I'm
pretty sure this is the Holy Land.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
And this is the biggest
alcoholics anonymous meeting
I've ever been to.
-I have a joke.
-All right.
-What do you call
women in Ireland?
-I don't know.
What do you call
women in Ireland?
-You call them women,
you chauvinist bastard.
-We landed in Belfast the
other day, and I'm like what?
Belfast?
Am I here for a job interview.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
I love Dublin.
I would never do
anything evil to Dublin.
-Really?
-I'm afraid of the soccer fans.
[Laughter]
But have you looked
at this audience?
-Yes.
-Closely.
When the lights are out?
-Yes.
-I am made entirely
out of bone and teeth,
and my color actually blends in.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
-All right, Achmed, look, as
everybody was coming tonight,
they were given an opportunity
or two to ask you a question.
-Yes.
-And everybody wrote them
down, and before the show
we grabbed a handful, and I
think you should answer them?
-Okie dokie.
-Dear Achmed, does Guinness
go right through you?
[Laughter]
-You asshole!
Yes!
And so does potatoes--
[Laughter]
Corned beef and
fucking sunlight.
All right,
Victor A very important question.
Victor, Is this legitimate?
<font color=#00FF00>Yes</font>
Okie Dokie

<font color=#00FF00>Yeah</font>

From Victor, It says:
"Dear Achmed, would you help me
propose to my girlfriend?"
No...
Next question?
I am just kidding Victor.
Can we turn on house lights please?
House lights
Okay..
The guys working the lights
are smoking weed.
Turn on the fucking lights.
There he is. OK
Victor before you do this..
Think this through..
Okay. All right. Let's hear it
Yeahhh..
This is the saddest thing I've ever seen
I asked your mommy to marry me
Prompted by a dead terrorist.
If you have kids name the first one Achmed
-Isn't England where
Mary Poppins is from.
-It took place in London.
-Oh yeah, OK.
Yeah.
You know, I dated
her for a while.
-You dated Mary Poppins?
-Yes, I did.
-No.
-Yeah, I did.
We were very young.
-Oh really?
yeah yeah..
-I was the first guy to get
into her chim chim cher-ee.
[Laughter]
Kinda ruined things when
in the moment of passion
she started screaming
some weird word.
It was like super
California refrigerator
x the delicious lotion.
Something like that.
Pretty kinky chick
I tell you that much
We landed in London its afternoon
Its time for a high tea with four
Very proper English ladies.
Walter do you know why are we here today?
Uh.. Tea
How come nobody is drinking it yet?
Well nobody has been told their mother
You do?... What did you call me?
we hardly ever have men at afternoon tea
We'll go out later. Trust me..
We want fun
So Peanut what has impressed you most
Since we been in England?
-Uh, I love this country
because just about everything
is double entendre.
-Like what?
-Oh, come on.
Even the food
Bangers and mash?
Come on!
-That's sausages and potatoes.
-It sounds more like
a male dance team.
Or two guys dating.
I don't want to be
mash, all right?
Have you seen any one famous since
we have been here?
Yes I actually did. I saw..
Victoria Beckham
You did not.
I did too
I Think, She was facing me
And then when she turns sideways
She disappeared
-Did you know that the very
first x-ray was taken right here
in Birmingham, England in 1896?
-Ha!
You call it an x-ray,
I call it a selfie.
-So what did you do today?
-I saw where they keep all
those useless wax figures.
-Ah, Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.
-No, no, no.
Parliament.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
-With that in mind,
have you learned
anything since we've been here?
-Uh, I've learned that
the folks in Birmingham
like to be called Brumies.
-Right.
-So I took that knowledge forward.
Unfortunately, the folks in Scotland
do not like to be called Scummies.
Oh, they got all pissed off.
I don't know what the
hell they were saying.
You ever try to talk
to an angry Scot?
Good God.
[Angry gibberish]
What the fuck are you saying?
Did you know that the Reverend Wilbet Audrey
Wrote Thomas the Tank Engine books here?
Really? hmm
So a clergyman came up with the
books for young boys?

Uh.. Who were the Beatles?
The Beatles were four boys
That come from Liverpool

So what do you
think of Liverpool so far?
-Having a good time.
Yeah, lots of huh..
Beatles stuff..
-Well, this is the original
home of the Beatles.
-Yeah, do Paul and Ringo
ever get back here,
or are they still trying to
avoid running into Pete Best?
[Laughter]
-For those who might be
watching and not be familiar,
Pete Best was the
original drummer
for The Beatles before--
-Before they dumped
his ass and got Ringo.
-That's right.
-That had to suck.
You think he's over it by now?
-I don't know.
You know they named a
street after Pete Best.
-Oh, well, yes, great.
[Laughter]
That's got to make up for the
millions of dollars and pounds,
don't you think?
What the hell's the
name of the street?
You got screwed boulevard?
Shafted Lane.. I don't kn..
It could have been you road.
I don't know..
You guys have all the crazy tourists
Wanting to see where the Beatles are from

<font color=#00FF00>Woooo Yeah</font>
Yeah.. Oh Yeah..
Shut up No one Cares here, Anyway
Graceland that's where Elvis fans flock
To see where Elvis lived

And you know there's hmm..
More to see here than just the Beatles stuff

[Laughter]
That'll bring in the tourists.
Come to Liverpool!
We have Beatles and mosquitoes!
And one of them carries
a deadly disease!
Find out which one!

After touring the Beatles museum in Liverpool
This morning we took a long drive
And we have now reached the
Border between England and Scotland
And here it is right here..

[Laughter]
When I said yes, instead
of taking off her top,
she brought me food.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
It was the worst strip
club I'd ever been to.
Tatties and neeps are
served with haggis.

time the murder rate went up.

Why not? You have to
But what are the odds
As we were coming here in the car we
Picked up the newspaper

of the people die
Skip the camels

[Applause]
You know, since being
here, I've been starting
to rethink the whole
suicide bomber thing.
-How's that?
-I blew myself to get a new
place and a few virgins,
meanwhile eight guys
in the front row
here have five mansions each,
a bunch of hot wives,
and their own skin.
I had no idea these
options were available.
I love you guys. Good Night.
-Welcome to Israel!
We are in the heart of the old city
Of Jerusalem
Where Christian, Jews and Muslims
All live together
But no matter what the differences
They all seem to agree on one thing
Satellite TV

-Where the hell are we?
[Laughter]
[Applause]

OK, well, uh, uh, um,

pick my wife out of the crowd.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
I'm at the Caramel Market in Tel Aviv Israel
One of the most famous markets

Circumcised. He asked you if
you were circumcised

[Laughter]
[Applause]
A-C-phlegm.
You guys know this stuff.
[Applause]
Why do these folks cheer for me?
Oh, I get it.
You like nothing better
than a dead terrorist.
[Applause]
I heard folks say that
Jews run the banks.
Well, I say good.
The Palestinians only
have the West Bank,

[Applause]
[continues hava nagila]
-You guys have been awesome!
Thanks for coming out!
Have you learned anything interesting
From visiting our country and
Do you use any of these bits
in your comedy shows?
We did the thing called
"Walking With The Lions"
We went out there and actually
Full grown lions, we are
actually walking with them.
While the guy that works there
Throws them pieces of chicken
to keep them busy
And if he runs out of chicken
You are screwed.
[Applause]
-What do you think of
South Africa so far?
-Honestly?
-Yeah.
-Not what I thought it would be.
-How's that?
-Look out there.
We're in Africa, right?
Lot of white folks out there.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
-It is South Africa.
-OK.
But it's the continent of Africa.
Well this is not what I
remember from the Tarzan movies.
What is your first name?
David?
And guys named David and Warren.
I don't think those
are African names.
[Laughter]
I was expecting like

[Laughter]
Hey David what do you do for living?

This is the guy. Right here
Did you know the one of biggest problems
Of South Africa is poaching of rhinos
Oh, Yes, I have heard this
It is mainly for the rhino horn
That's right.. Yes
Did you know that you really don't get
in trouble here if you kill a poacher?
Really? Right.
So you can kill poachers?
You can hunt them
That's right
Well, that's what I have heard.
OK. But it'll be weird having a trophy
On your wall of a stuffed guy
Named Gary.
-You know, Bubba J,
Jo'burg is a lively city.
-Oh yeah, unless you get shot.
-Did you know that
South Africa has
the largest brewery
in the world?
[gasp]
[Applause]
-The largest brewery?
I'm going to write a letter.
My dearest wife,
For reasons
you will of course understand,
I am never coming home.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
So after you become a
citizen of the South Africa,
how long does it take for
your skin to turn black?
[Laughter]
These guys are early

[Applause]
Okatol is a place you can see lions
Scary Lions, Bad ass Lions
Very Very close up..

While they are eating or they will
Turn me into part of the meal
You need to come in here

Sight seeing bus tour today.
Yes I did.
Six hour bus ride.
What did you see?
One block..
They say JoBerg is known best for its
Cultural diversity.
No it's not..
It's the fuckin traffic.
Maybe traffic would moved around better
If they put up the right signs..
-All right, you guys
have just been great.
What a crowd.
Thank you so much.
All right, let's turn up
the lights real quick.
Can we do the house lights?
Let's do this real quick?

Oh yeah, this'll be great.
Hold on, let me get Achmed.
Hold on a second.
Can you do it sideways?
Is that good?
This way.
-You dumbass idiot, Jeff.
-Have you seen the size of
the bugs in this country?
[Laughter]
-Yeah, there's some big ones.
-There was a beetle
in our hotel room,
and my wife wanted
me to step on it?
-What did you do?
-Nothing.
The damn thing grabbed my wife's
poodle and flew out the window.
[Laughter]
I love this country.
[Mimicking Puppy's Cry]
Bye.. hah hah hah..
I thought that Irish can throw back a few
But you guys are the drinking
champions of the world..
I'm surprised you don't have dead
sharks with alcohol poisoning
After eating your surfers..
Did you know that even though Australia
Had a bit influx of criminals they now
have you know.. only..
I don't know.. one fifth as many
Murders as we do in the US.
Oh yeah?
Does that surprise you?
It doesn't you?
No
You know how much practice it
takes to kill somebody

Australians.. yeah them too
You know in a couple days we will

More sheep than humans there..

"New Zealand where baaha means No"
You met any bogens?
What the hell is a bogen?
A bogen is what they call someone who
Unsophisticated, Uneducated or
not a lot of class
Ow.. Yes I have..

Virgins left here
Except for maybe that guy, right there
Just guessing.
-Dear Achmed, my dream
was to see you and Jeff.
I've been waiting
for seven long years,
so because I've been waiting
so long, could I please

So Walter, what do you
think of Singapore so far?
-Uh, it's pretty crowded here.
-Oh yeah, that's true.
It's actually the
second most densely
populated country in the world.
-Oh.
Well, don't flatter yourself.
All these folks aren't
here to see you.
There was just no
room for them outside.
We came all the way from Hollywood
California to be here
And did you now what the first place our
Tour guide recommended for us to visit?
Universal Freakin Studios
I was like we have that dumbass
-What do you like
about Singapore so far?
Well, they have some tough laws.
-Oh, you heard about that?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
-Did you know you can
get fined or caned
for not flushing a toilet after using it?
[Laughter]
-And who the hell
checks up on that?
[Laughter]
What, do you got the shit police?
[Laughter]
It's the SSP, the
Singapore shit police.
[Laughter]
[Applause]

[Laughter]
Did you know Singapore's Airport is
Considered to be nicest in the world?
Oh really?
The nicest airport in the world?
That's right.. Yeah
Do they have many other things
That they say are nicest in the world?
I.. ab.. I'm not sure..
So when you drive away
from Singapore Airport
It's all downhill after that?
No..
I found out that every male in Singapore
who is over 18 has been trained on
How to use a gun
Oh..
In other words
You better be funny asshole
-I heard you say earlier that
in Singapore if you break
certain laws they
beat you with a stick.
Well, maybe while

there a lot more Buddhists here.
-Buddhists?
They all wear boots?
So what do they do?
-Well, for one they
believe in reincarnation.
-Re-incarceration?
[Laughter]
You get out and suddenly
you're right back in.

So that way when you say stupid stuff
It goes [whip sound] across your legs
And you go ahh ohhh
And then when you fall down
Rinyal goes:
"Hello can I help you?"
You know Singapore is one
of the only country
Around here that recognizes Israel.
What the hell does that mean?
How could you not recognize it?
It's like eyy..
What that country with all that
Jews over there?
I have no idea, I don't recognize it.
Do do the other countries see Israel at
A party they are like, "No..
I don't think we have met.."
And where is Buba J's friend uhuhuhuh
Can you help me call uhruhrh?
-We had a great show in
Singapore, we're packing up,
and Marnel, my tour manager
comes in to deliver some news.
And he's sweating.
-Hey, what's up?
-Come in.
-I've got some
information on Malaysia.
They're reviewing several options,
And option A is not going to be--
-Option A meaning
I can't use Achmed.
-It hasn't been defined by
the cultural-- what is it?
The Cultural sensitivity.
-Hold it.
You're saying that these
guys-- who are these guys?
-It's actually one of
their religious leaders
that they had to fly to
another city to meet with them.
-I'm telling you I am the
lamb going to slaughter.
So they'll start
booing, and they're
not going to be booing me.
They're going to be booing the
fact that this is happening.
-They're probably aware
a lot of this stuff.
They're probably
used to restrictions.
-No, they're not.
-They're probably used to
living with [inaudible].
-We are promoting the show
with Achmed on the poster.
It's gonna be a challenge because
Obviously, I have to..
Leave out, Any references to anything
even remotely, relating to religion.
I can't even say the word virgin
I can't even say the name Achmed
I mean I could, Of course i could but
I wanna go home. I don't wanna
stay here and get caned.
Well, the main concern for
the Malaysian government
is that an artist is suitable
for the Malaysian culture.
Achmed is a little bit sensitive
to the Malaysian public.
We need to be careful
about what we put on stage.
The final ruling is that
Achmed the dead terrorist
is not allowed on stage.
Have you learnt anything constructive
About Malaysia since we been here?
I did learn on the radio
You can not talk about politics
religion or sex.
That's right.
Well, there goes most of our show
Did you know that Malaysia has been
Independent now for 47 years..
Fascinating.
And the coincidence..
What's that?
I lost my independency when I
got married 47 years ago
Guess what?
We don't talk about politics
I lost my religion and there is no sex
So I'm in the middle of my show
I look towards the sides of room and
There is military guys with rifles
And they don't look happy
Please don't get me into the trouble
I don't care
Keep looking around
You are surrounded
Please let me change the subject..
OH KAY..
I like being here.. OK.
That's good cos you might be here
A long time.
What is your first name?
<font color=#00FF00>Sean</font> . Sean
Is that with the 'ean' or 'H'?
<font color=#00FF00>'ean'</font>
Oh, 'ean, So its actually Seen.

Is this your wife, your girlfriend
Or another investment chic. Who is this?

Oh, your mom.
Holy shit

Hey, Maybe it's a same thing
You can be honest. Is your you..
your girlfriend doesn't care about us?
Is that it?
<font color=#00FF00>She got exams</font>
Oh, she she, In the middle
of final exams?
And you just don't care.
You gonna tell your professor:
"But Sir, I was at a puppet show."
"With my mom"
Sean what is your girlfriend studying?
<font color=#00FF00>Management</font>.
Management?
Better look out,

She just gonna fuckin tell you what to do
-After we booked this
show, we were contacted
by the Malaysian ministry of
arts, and history,
<font color=#00FF00>Boo
</font>And culture
And they asked me very
nicely and sternly
to not bring a certain
character to the show tonight.
[booing]

not even mention his name,
but I know that you people are
here because you've seen stuff
On YouTube and you're
expecting to see a certain someone.
<font color=#00FF00>Yeah!!!</font>
[Applause]
However, I want to respect the
request because I am a guest
here, but at the same
time you paid your money
to see what you thought
you were gonna see.
That certain person is not here.
However,

-No.

[Laughter]
[Applause]
Let's just say for
the sake of the joke,
France is always
hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, like a desert up.
[Laughter]

As the language of love.
Oui, Oui

-Let me get something straight.
You're the brother
of the other guy
who was supposed to be here.

[gasp]
-I am not human?
-Not any more.

[Laughter]
[Applause]
But the ministry is a
lovely group of people.
[Laughter]
-You guys have
been just awesome.
Thanks KL.
We'll see you.
Good night!
So we've been all over
the globe and I wanted
to end this special in the place
that's most important to me.
How could we not?
It's not a fancy stage.
In fact, a lot of the audience
is sitting in the mud.
It's been raining.
They're sitting in the grass.
But here we are in
the land of the free
and the home of the brave.
Here we are at Joint
Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.
