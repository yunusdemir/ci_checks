You're nobody
'til somebody loves you
You're nobody
'til somebody cares
You may be king
You may possess the world
And its gold
But gold won't bring you
happiness
When you're growin' old
The world still is the same
You never change it
As sure as the stars
Shine above
You're nobody
'til somebody loves you
So find yourself
somebody to love
The world
still is the same
You never change it
As sure as the stars
Shine above
But you're nobody
'til somebody loves you
So find yourself
somebody to love
So find yourself

- Okay, so what if l don't want to give up on her?
- You don't call.
- You said l don't call if l wanted to give up on her.
- Right.
- So l don't call either way.
- Right.
- So what's the difference?
- There is no difference right now.
See, Mike, the only difference
between giving up and not giving up...
is if you take her back
when she wants to come back.
But you can't do anything
to make her want to come back.
ln fact, you can only do stuff
to make her not want to come back.
So the only difference is if l forget about
her or just pretend to forget about her.
- Right.
- Well, that sucks.
Yeah, it sucks.
So it's like a retroactive decision then?
l mean, l could, like, forget about her.
And then when she comes back, make like
l just pretended to forget about her?
Right, although probably
more likely the opposite.
What do you mean?
l mean, at first you're gonna pretend
to forget about her.
Not call her,
l don't know, whatever.
But then, eventually,
you really will forget about her.
- Well, unless she comes back first.
- Mm, see, that's the thing.
Somehow they know not to come back
until you really forget.
- There's the rub.
- There's the rub.
Look, man, uh, l-l'm sorry we always
talk about the same thing all the time.
- Ah, no, it's all right. - lt's just that, you know...
lt's just you been there, man.
- Don't sweat it.
- Your advice really helps. And l just, l don't know...
You know, Rob, you're the only one
l can talk to about her.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
- [Machine Switches On]
- [Male Electronic Voice] Hello, you have four messages.
- Message one.
- [Beeps]
[Man] Hey, gorgeous,
it's, uh, Trent calling.
Look, you gotta get that girl
out of your head. Uh, l hope my...
- [Electronic Voice] Message two.
- [Beeps]
[Man] Hey, Mike, uh, if you want
to talk about Michelle, give me...
- Message three.
- [Beeps]
- [Woman] Did she call yet? l'm sure she...
- Message four.
- [Beeps]
- Michael, this is Grandma.
We all miss you
back here in New York.
You still haven't told me if you got
that part on the television pro...
- That was your last message.
- [Beeping]
[Electronic Voice]
You have to put things in perspective.
- l know, l know.
- She doesn't deserve you.
Thanks. l appreciate that.
There are plenty of fish
in the sea.
Okay, that's great advice.
Thanks a lot. Okay? Bye.
- Life, after all...
- Please, l'm trying to make a phone call.
- Are you calling her?
- No. Will you stop? l'm try... Please.
[Beeping]
[Phone Ringing]
- [Man] Hello?
- What's up, Trent?
[Trent] Hey, we got two parties
tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
- l don't know.
- Listen to me, baby. There's gonna be beautiful babies there.
l... Look, Trent, uh,
l got shit to do tomorrow.
Listen to you. l've got a final callback on a
pilot at 9:00, and l'm going to this thing.
Come on, Mike, you got to get out
with the beautiful babies.
- You can't sit at home thinking about it.
- Not tonight.
Not tonight? Listen to you!
We're gonna have fun tonight.
- We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
- [Sighs]
We're gonna spend half the night driving
around the hills looking for this one party,
and you're gonna say it sucks,
and we're all gonna leave,
and then we're gonna go look
for this other party.
But all the parties
and all the bars, they all suck.
l spend half the night talkin' to some
girl who's lookin' around the room...
to see if there's somebody else who's
more important she should be talking to.
And it's like l'm supposed to be all happy,
uh, 'cause she's wearing a backpack.
l... You know, and half of them
are just nasty skanks...
who wouldn't be nothing, except they're
surrounded by a bunch of drunken, horny assholes.
l'm gonna tell you something, T.
Are you listening?
- Yeah, l'm listening. - l'm not gonna
be one of those assholes, all right?
lt just makes me sick.
lt's like, uh, some nasty skank who
isn't half the woman my girlfriend is...
is gonna front me?
- lt makes me want to fuckin' puke.
- Jesus Christ!
Will you shut up for a minute? We gotta
get you the fuck out of Dodge, man.
- We're goin' to Vegas tonight.
- What are you talkin' about?
- Vegas, baby. Vegas!
- What do you mean, Vegas?
- Vegas. Las Vegas.
- l'm not going to no Vegas.
Yeah. l think... You know what, man?
We're gonna go to Vegas and, uh...
- When are we going to Vegas?
- We're going tonight.
- No, we're not going tonight. l'm not going to Vegas!
- l'm gonna pick you up.
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me. l'm not going, okay?
- None of this shit anymore.
- Listen, l just listened to you; now hear me out.
- You bring something nice to wear.
- [Laughs]
- l'm not going to Vegas.
- Mike, we're going.
l'm not going to Vegas.
All right, listen. l took out $300,
but l'm only betting with 100.
l can't afford any more
than that, all right?
And l figure if we buy a lot of chips,
though, the pit boss will see us,
he'll comp us all sorts of free shit;
that's how it works over there.
- But you gotta be cool.
- l'm cool, baby, l'm cool.
They're gonna give Daddy a room,
some breakfast, maybe Bennett singing.
- l know just the place.
- What the hell are you wearin'?
l thought you said
we're gonna wear suits.
Oh, Mike, you gotta stop worrying
about this. We're goin' to Vegas, man.
lf you're wearing a suit, and you look like
you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
lt's in the back.
l'll put it on when we get there.
Uh-uh. No way. No, turn around.
l'm goin' home.
You gotta show up wearing that suit,
or otherwise l'm not going.
All right already, okay? l'll put my
suit on. Grab the wheel. Hold it steady.
- l'm tellin' you, this is how you do it.
- l know!
- They're watching you when you drive up. That's how it works.
- Fine, fine.
lt could work.
l'm serious.
They're gonna give Daddy
the Rain Man suite. You dig that?
- We're going to Vegas, Mike. Vegas!
- Vegas!
You think we can
get there by midnight?
- We're gonna be up five "hundy" by midnight!
- Yeah!
- Vegas! Vegas!
- Vegas, baby. Vegas!
- [Quietly] Vegas, baby. Vegas.
- [Radio: Country]
'Cause l'm not the happy guy
l used to be
She thinks l
Still care
But if she's happy thinking
l still need her
Vegas, baby. Vegas.
Vegas.
[Big Band]
lt's the root of all evil
Of strife and upheaval
But l'm certain, honey
That life would be sunny
With plenty of money
And you
[Slot Machines Dinging]
[Mike] l always thought, uh,
Caesar's was more the dope spot.
Back in their day, this place was a real contender,
but now they'll appreciate the business.
They'll probably fall all over themselves for
a couple of high-class guys like me and you.
- Now, we're not...
- You want to be fresh on the scene, right?
The new places down on the strip,
now, those places are supposed to be it.
Oh, Mike, you don't want all that fuckin'
Pirate of the Caribbean horseshit.
Or the rock and roll
grunge tip.
You know, guys like me and
you gotta kick it here. Old school.
Yeah, this is...
This is truly old school.
- [Trent] Definitely old school.
- This place is fuckin' dead.
You know, l'm gonna find me two waitresses
here and l'm gonna pull me a Fredo.
- Yeah, well, they're all skanks.
- What are you talkin' about?
Look at all the
beautiful babies here.
The beautiful babies don't work
midnights to 6:00 on a... on a Wednesday.
- This is the skank shift.
- Look at all the beautiful honeys here.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, darling. l want you to remember this face here.
This is the guy behind the guy
behind the guy.
Okay.
Will you cut that shit out?
- What? She smiled.
- That's not cool, man.
- Did she or did she not smile?
- lt doesn't matter.
- Mike, l'm telling you, girls love that stuff.
- You're gonna screw up our plan.
- Baby, we're gonna get laid.
- Could we first see what happens when we play it cool?
What do you think, Mike? Do you think she's
gonna leave us and go tell her pit boss on us?
Will you stop makin' fun,
all right?
The trick is we gotta look like we don't need
the shit, then they give us shit for free.
Right, right, right.
Well, l think you look great, man.
l think l'm looking like the money,
like the bomb, right?
All right, stop. See that? That, uh,
table? That's where we make our scene.
[Trent] You think
they'll notice me and you?
Oh, they're gonna notice me and you,
'cause they're watching.
- Nicely done, sir. You're on a streak now.
- lt's about time.
One of the best streaks
l've ever had. l wanna get even.
Uh, start with, uh,
l don't know, 300?
l can count that
for you.
- On the table.
- Excuse me?
- You have to lay it on the table.
- l don't want to bet it all.
You're not allowed
to hand me money, sir.
You have to lay it on the table
if you want me to change it.
- Changing 300.
- [Man] Three hundred.
- Do you have anything smaller?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, l do.
But this happens to be
a $100 minimum bet table.
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable
at one of our lower stakes tables.
Okay, just tuck 'em under,
just like this.
There you go.
[Woman]
Cocktails?
Guy behind the guy.
l'll have a scotch
on the rocks, please.
Any scotch will do, as long
as it's not a blend, of course.
Uh, single malt.
Glenlivet, Glenfiddich perhaps.
Maybe a Glengow... Any Glen.
Scotch on the rocks.
- Double down.
- What?
You got an 11.
You always double down on an 11.
l know, but it's $200.
lt's blood money.
- Mike, you gotta double down.
- l can't double down.
- Mike, if you don't look like you know what you're doing...
- Will you stop for a second?
- Just shut up, okay? l can't. - lf you don't
look like you know what you're doing...
Just stop for a second!
[Arguing Continues]
Double down.
That's nice.
[Trent]
Eighteen. Good. Eighteen's good.
[Dealer]
Twelve. Sixteen.
Twenty-one.
l'm telling you, baby,
you always double down on an 11.
- Well, obviously not always.
- Always, baby.
l'm just saying not
in this particular case.
- You always double... - l lost, okay?
How could you say "always"?
- [Dealer] Lady has 11. What would you like to do?
- Um, l hit.
- Fifteen.
- l don't know what to do here.
l'll hit again.
Seventeen.
Okay. l'll hit there. Okay.
- Twenty-one.
- Oh, my gosh! Twenty-one!
l got it!
Oh, my heavens. Thank you!
Whee!
Would you like to have some breakfast
this morning, ma'am?
Oh, l really shouldn't. But then again,
it's a good idea. l'd love it.
- Thank you so much!
- Why not? By all means.
- Take this ticket in with you when you go in.
- Oh, thank you!
- They'll fix you up.
- You'll fix me up.
That went plenty nice, baby.
You're up 20 bucks.
You know, l mean not counting
what happened on the first table.
- Thanks for clarifying that.
- l'm down too, Mike.
- Yeah? What'd you lose?
- l don't know what l dropped.
Let's see, l dropped
probably 35 or...
Don't give me that shit. You know
exactly what you lost. What'd you drop?
Twenty, all right? But l was down at least fifty.
l'm sorry. l got lucky on the craps table.
You shouldn't be sorry.
You're a winner. l'm the fuckin' loser.
- l'm the one who should be sorry.
- Baby, don't talk that way.
Could we just go, please?
Could we go?
Baby, look at me. Look at me.
You're money. And you know what else?
You're a big winner tonight.
- l want to leave.
- You're a big winner.
l'm gonna ask you a simple question,
and l want you to listen to me.
Who's the big winner
here tonight at the casino? Huh?
- Mikey, that's who. Mikey's the big winner.
- Okay.
- Mikey wins.
- What a fuckin' asshole.
Fine, l'm an asshole. But you know what?
You're the big winner tonight, Mikey.
- You're the big winner in more ways than one.
- There you two are.
l walked around for an hour
with that stupid scotch on my tray.
We got knocked out pretty fast.
- Ah, a couple of high rollers like yourself?
- Can you believe it?
- l'm gonna get you that scotch.
- You know, forget about it.
- l didn't even want it. l just wanted to order it.
- Can l get you something else?
l mean, you really shouldn't leave
without getting something for free.
Why ruin a perfect night?
Listen, um, bring a single-malted,
uh, Glengarry for me...
and one
for my boy Mikey here.
And if you tell the bartender
to go easy on the water,
then this 50-cent piece has your
name written all over it, okay?
l want you to run along,
'cause l'll be timing you.
l'm gonna keep time.
One, two, three, four.
- What an asshole.
- Baby, that was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
- That was so demeaning.
- She smiled, baby.
- l can't believe what an asshole you are.
- No, baby, she smiled.
- She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- She was smiling at how money l was, what l did with her.
- Could we get out of here?
- l'm not gonna pay for a room.
- Mike, what the hell do you want to get out of here for?
- The honey baby's bringing us a cocktail.
- What, are you nuts?
- You think she's coming back here?
- l know she's coming back.
Did you hear what she said? "You shouldn't
leave without getting something for free."
Baby, she wants to party.
She wants to.
l'm tired. We should just go.
Baby, this is what we came for. Now, we
met a beautiful baby, and she likes you.
- She likes you.
- Whatever. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend.
Now, l don't care if l end up with her
or one of her beautiful baby friends.
lt's just l been... l been out
of the game for so long, man.
- lt's been like six years.
- Listen, it's hard, l know. l been there myself.
Not for six years or anything,
but l've been there.
Not for six years or anything,
but l've been there.
The best thing you can do
is just get back out there.
lt's just l... l'm not attracted to them.
l keep thinking of my girlfriend.
Then l'm trying to, like,
maintain a conversation with them.
Mike, do you even think l know what the
hell they're saying to me half the time?
l don't know if they're talking
about how hard it is to be adopted...
or how their dad
can't show 'em affection.
All l do, man, is stare at their mouth
and wrinkle my eyebrows,
and somehow l turn out
to be a big sweetie, okay?
Take this girl here.
She's a waitress in Las Vegas.
But l bet somewhere inside of her
there is a very, very special dream.
- And no matter how hard l try, l won't...
- [Waitress Clears Throat]
Hey, there she is, the most
special lady in town, right?
- Yup.
- What time do you get off, uh, Christy?
- 6:00.
- 6:00, great.
- Two Glengarrys down, easy on the water.
- Fantastic.
Uh, listen. Why don't you call a friend
and have her meet the three of us...
- at the Bamboo Lounge at 6:01?
- You got it.
- All right?
- Sure. Hey.
That was so fuckin' money.
That was like the Jedi mind shit.
See, that's what l'm trying to tell you,
baby. Girls love that kind of stuff.
They don't go
for the sensitive shit.
You start talking to 'em about, uh,
you know, puppy dogs and ice cream.
They know what you want to do. What do you think?
You really think they don't know?
- No. l know.
- They know what you want, baby. Believe me.
When you pretend it's just
like a waste of their time.
You're gonna take 'em that way eventually, right?
Don't apologize for it.
lt's just that l get this thing where l want
to be a gentleman and l wanna show respect.
Oh, Mike.
Respect, my ass.
What they respect is honesty.
Look, you see how they dress when they go out, right?
They want you to notice 'em.
All you're doin' is letting them know that it's working.
Get off this respect kick.
There's nothing wrong with letting
the girls know that you're money...
- and that you wanna party.
- You ready to order?
Yeah. l'll have a coffee...
Two, uh, two coffees.
And it says, uh, here,
"Breakfast anytime."
That's right.
l'll have the, uh, pancakes and the,
uh, age of enlightenment, please.
And for you?
Oh, um, let's see,
l'll have the, um, the Toucan.
- Over easy.
- l'll be back with the coffee.
All right, great.
Nice, baby.
Renaissance.
lt went over her head.
l should have said renaissance.
Age of enlightenment. l...
Oh, God! Like a Las Vegas waitress is gonna get
an obscure French philosophical reference?
lt's like l'm trying
to show off to her.
l may as well have just said,
"Let me jump your ignorant bones."
Don't even sweat her.
We're gonna meet our honeys soon.
- You know Christy's friend is
gonna be money. - lt's 20 to.
- We gotta get out of here.
- Baby, will you relax just for a minute here?
Excuse me. We have...
We're in a little bit of a hurry.
Hang on, Voltaire.
- l get paid for loving
- Hmm
Loving all the time
[Chattering]
- How're you doin', guys?
- Hey, boys.
- We almost gave up on you.
- l'm sorry we're late.
- There's, uh, no clocks in this town anywhere.
- No harm done.
- This is Lisa.
- Hi.
- l'm sorry. l never got your name.
- l'm Mike.
- Mike.
- This is Trent. We call him Double Down.
- Trent.
- Stop right there.
- Ladies, don't you always double down on an 11?
- Always.
- No matter what. Like splitting aces.
- Whatever.
- Hi, Lisa. l'm Trent. lt's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Lovely, uh, make-up job
you have there.
- Oh. Uh, Lisa works at the MGM Grand.
- l'm a Dorothy.
Oh, Lisa's a Dorothy.
That's great. That's great.
Well, we're not
in Kansas anymore.
So, uh, what do
you guys do?
Well, l'm a comedian.
[Laughs]
Um, do you ever play out here?
l'd love to see you sometime.
- No.
- Why not?
Well, there are, uh... You know,
it's just different circuits.
- lt's hard to explain. You wouldn't understand.
- Who's your booking agent?
[Panting]
She... She knows...
Actually, l don't have
West Coast representation as of yet.
Oh, who's your representation
back East?
l didn't... l sort of freelanced on
my own, kind of found my own things.
- 'Cause l...
- So what do you do, Trent?
- l'm a producer.
- Oh! Cool!
[Whispers]
That's great.
[Christy] l'm really
not supposed to drink here.
We should go someplace else.
How's my place?
- Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah?
- All right?
- Yeah, we... Yeah, sure.
- Right.
- Because if you can't drink here...
- Then you can't drink.
- Why not?
- That'll be great.
- Okay, great. Let's go.
[Christy]
You were in Acapulco Beach?
[Lisa]
We watch that all the time.
- No, no, no, no, wait.
- [Trent] Yeah, yeah.
The worst was when l went in for
this Afterschool Special, right?
So l'm sitting
in the waiting room,
and there's all these little kids, uh,
sitting in the waiting room with me.
And l see that all the kids are signed
in for the exact same role as me.
- They're auditioning for the same role as you?
- Right.
So, uh, l check the time and the place.
l'm where l'm supposed to be.
l call my agent up. She says, "Trent,
they asked for you specifically."
- What was the thing? - l don't know what it was.
lt was "Drugs are Bad."
"Jenny Eats Something." Whatever.
lt's Afterschool Special bullshit.
- Right. [Giggles]
- "Jenny Eats Something."
The role l'm reading for is "brother."
l'm reading for the part of "brother."
Big brother
or little brother?
- Just brother, man. Just brother.
- No.
Just brother, right? Finally l get
to go in and meet everyone, right?
Mikey, l'm telling you,
l was money.
lt's a starring role.
l practiced for a week.
So l'm reading with the casting director
and, girls, l literally start crying.
- No.
- l swear to God.
The casting director who's reading with
me kinda gets caught up in the vibe.
- She starts crying.
- Oh!
- Yeah, l swear to God. Swear to God.
- Wow.
So now she's crying.
l'm crying.
We're both kinda crying, but not
the kind of crying that's like...
But the kind of crying that's
like we're trying not to cry.
Do you know what l mean? Like we're not
trying to... Whatever. lt was very cool.
So l finished reading with her.
l finally hold up my finger,
like give me a minute here.
- Right.
- [Choking Up] Like give me a minute.
More than that, 'cause l'm in it.
But like l'm broke.
[Sobbing] Give me a second here.
May l have a minute?
So l put down my head,
and the whole room sits in silence...
for at least five minutes.
- Swear to God, five minutes.
- Whoa!
l look up, everyone
rips up in applause.
The whole room is rip-roaring clapping
it up for me, for big T, right?
Everyone in the room is sitting there tearing their face.
They're crying their eyes out.
The guy working the camera, you know,
just filming it? Got tears in his eyes.
- Not the camera guy.
- l swear to God, the camera guy.
Not so much from my reading,
although it had a lot to do with it,
but, really, he had
his own things going on.
So the producer
starts to talk to me.
He says, "Trent, when you
walked in this room",
l didn't see Trent Walker
come in here."
He said, "l saw big brother
come in here." Fuckin' great, right?
He says, "You walked in with the role,
you nailed it, you're great."
- So give me the fuckin' part.
- Exactly. Right?
Then he says to me... He says,
"Trent, l gotta be honest with you."
l think that it might be that
you may be just a little bit old...
"for the role of brother."
So l felt confident,
'cause l gave a good read.
l say to him, "Well, how old exactly
is the role of brother?"
- [Mike] Here it comes.
- 'Cause l'm tall.
- Here it comes.
- But l look young, Mike. Do l look young, girls?
Yeah, you do.
So he says to me... l swear to God he
says this to me with a straight face.
This fucking guy.
"Eleven years old."
- And you said "double down."
- Double down.
Because you know why? Because you
make it happen on the bets.
He's great, isn't he?
But the truth of the matter was,
you saw my picture, you saw my tape.
You know l'm 24 years old.
Why did you call me in?
- Wow.
- That's your great bit.
Well, we all have stories.
- Wow.
- Yup.
Uh, how rude of me. l never...
l never gave you the... the tour.
[Rock]
[Giggles]
Come on home, girl
He said with a smile
You don't have to love me
and let's get high a while
But try to understand
Try to understand
- Ohh
- l'm gonna check on my boy.
Ohh, try
Try to understand
Try, try
Try to understand
He's a magic man
l'm sure she'll call.
l mean, six years
is a long time.
- You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
- But she did.
- And she's with somebody else now.
- Already?
- Yeah.
- Oh, you poor thing.
- You know what? lt won't last.
- Why not?
- lt's a rebound.
- We were a rebound and we lasted for six years.
Well, yeah, but how long was the
relationship she was rebounding from?
Six years.
Uh, can l check
my messages real quick?
- l have a calling card. lt won't cost anything.
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, sure. The phone's in the back.
- l'm not ruining tonight, am l?
- No, it's okay.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Oh, l understand.
- l'm sorry.
- lt's okay.
T.
Trent.
Trent.
l need to, uh, u...
No. l gotta... l gotta use...
l gotta use the phone.
- You can check 'em tomorrow.
- l need to use the phone.
Okay? l'm sorry.
Hold on.
l'm sure l... They weren't
in there that long.
l don't think we're
interrupting anything.
[Exhales]
l have a calling card.
So it's a 800...
it's a 800 number.
- [Dial Tone]
- [Beeping]
- Six years? Oh, poor thing.
- l know.
- And you know what he said?
- What? What?
- And l believe him.
- What?
- He said, "l just want her to be happy."
- He said that?
- lt's so sweet. So sweet.
- That is so sweet.
- Oh.
- l know.
l'll make some coffee.
- [Drapes Being Drawn]
- Mmm.
[Both Chuckle Nervously]
[Women Whispering]
Did she call?
- [Christy] Oh!
- Oh, Mike, l'm so...
Oh, God.
That's so bad. l'm sorry.
[Lisa]
lt's gonna be okay.
She asked me what l was thinking about.
Did you want me to lie?
You didn't have to
get into it, baby.
l'm sorry about
interrupting you guys.
Oh, don't worry about it. l just wanted
you to have a good time, that's all.
- Christy was nice.
- Yeah, l really didn't like her that much, to be honest.
- Why not? - l don't know, man. She just...
She didn't really do it for me.
What'd you think of that,
uh, Dorothy girl?
The whole Judy Garland thing
kinda turned me on.
- Does that make me some kind of a fag?
- No, baby, you're money.
- l don't think she liked me anyway.
- Mike, l'm tellin' you, man.
- She thought you were money.
- l don't think so.
l heard 'em both talking.
Both those girls thought you were money.
You're a good friend.
Look, you take yourself
outta the game.
You start talkin' to 'em
about puppy dogs and ice cream,
of course it's going to end up
on the friendship tip.
l just don't think
she liked me in that way.
Baby, you are so money,
and you don't even know it.
Look, T, the girls don't go for me
the way they go for you, okay?
- Michelle went for you, right?
- That's different.
- Why? How is that different?
- We were younger. lt was college.
You didn't go to college. You don't know how it is.
The girls are young, they drink.
- They don't know any better.
- Do you know how stupid that sounds?
Listen to me. Your self-esteem is low right
now because she's with somebody else.
But talkin' about it and thinkin' about
it all the time, it's depressing.
lt's no good, man.
l just need
a little more time.
Why, so you can sit around your stuffy
apartment beating yourself up over it?
- Remember the first week after she told you?
- Don't remind me.
Huh? Couldn't even
leave your place.
You know, you just sat around
your stuffy apartment,
sitting there, drinking orange juice,
feeling sorry for yourself.
Now look at you, man. Right?
l mean, you got a part in a movie.
- A day.
- Whatever, Mike. lt's work. You understand?
You're doing what you love to do.
What the hell is she doing now?
Selling scrap metal.
Okay. And this guy she's seeing,
what the hell does he do?
- [Mumbling] He drives a carriage.
- What?
l heard he drives a carriage
around Central Park or something.
Oh, Mike, please! You're
the fun-lovin', outgoing party guy,
and you're sweatin'
some lawn jockey.
and you're sweatin'
some lawn jockey.
Jesus Christ!
l'm tellin' you, man.
You're better off without this girl.
You gotta trust me on this, Mike.
- All right, buddy?
- Stop talking. Shut up.
Okay, l'm gonna try. l promise you l
will shut up if you shut the hell up.
- We're gonna make this work.
- You're damn right you're gonna try.
- [Engine Revving]
- Let's get home.
- l'm a man of means by no means
- Los Angeles.
King of the road
l know every engineer
of every train
All their children
and all of their names
And every handout
in every town
Every lock that ain't locked
when no one's around
l seen trailers
for sale or rent
- [Rob] l don't think l'm gonna take it.
- Look, it's a gig.
This is definitely
a step back for me.
There's not much of a call
for Shakespeare in this town.
There's just something
about being Goofy, all right?
Any other Disney character would
be fine. Mickey? Mickey's an icon.
- Why does it have to be Goofy?
- What do you want? You're tall.
How am l gonna
tell my parents?
l still haven't told them
l didn't get the series.
You tested over a month ago.
l'm sure they figured it out.
lt's like, "Mom, hi.
l didn't get that pilot."
By the way, l'm Goofy.
Send more money."
[Taps Ball]
Hey, Rob.
You notice l didn't
mention her once today.
- l didn't want to say anything.
- Oh, yeah? Why?
Ah, it's kind of like not talking to your
pitcher in the middle of a no-hitter.
- What do you mean? Like you didn't want to jinx it?
- Kinda.
- l don't talk about her that much.
- [Laughing]
- l didn't mention her once today.
- Tend the pin.
The only reason l mentioned her at all was to
tell you l'm not gonna talk about her anymore.
- l thought you'd appreciate that.
- l do. Good for you, Mikey.
- Get there.
- Play it out.
- l decided to get back out there.
- Good. Glad to hear it.
- Can't make any more excuses for myself.
- Excellent.
- [Sighs]
- Do you wanna hit the town tonight?
Uh, l shouldn't.
lt's a weeknight.
- You got a Pluto callback?
- Yeah, kick me when l'm down.
- All right. Count 'em up.
- How many strokes?
One, two, three...
- Eight, nine.
- What'd you get?
- Eight or a nine.
- l'll give you an eight.
- What did you get?
- l got an eight.
Dead heat after one hole.
lt's turning into quite a rivalry.
You better replace the pin, Chi Chi.
The natives look restless.
- [Computer Game]
- [Man] You bitch! You bitch!
- [Trent] Chelios steals to Roenick.
- [All Groaning]
- [Trent] Money!
- Bitch!
[Mike] Sue, why is
Gretzky on his ass again?
- Gretzky's a little bitch.
- God, this is such bullshit, man. This is bullshit!
[Mike] The Kings suck in this game.
You should play another team.
- l took the Kings to the Cup.
- Yeah, against the computer with the offsides off.
- They're a finesse team, bro.
- They're a fuckin' bitch team. Score... Oh!
You bitch!
What a fuckin' bitch!
- Watch out, motherfucker.
- No, you do not fuckin' hit my elbow.
[Trent] lt's not even so much me
as it's Roenick. He's good.
[Sue]
Oh, is that right?
- Chelios steals to Roenick.
- [Sue] You bitch!
Score Chicago! Ohh!
- That was pretty.
- Such fuckin' bullshit!
But that was pretty, Sue.
Check this out on the instant replay.
- Dude, do not...
- You said it was fuckin' bullshit. Check it out.
- Look at it!
- [Both Arguing]
- Look at it!
- l don't want to!
Why do you think they put
the instant replay in the fucking game?
- God, you're unbelievable.
- So you can see if it's bullshit.
- l am unbelievable. Look at it.
- Every goal you're gonna watch the instant replay?
- Come on, man, l want to fuckin' play.
- l want him to learn it.
- l never get to play.
- You should practice this when l'm not here.
- Just fuckin' move it.
- When l'm not here, will you practice this?
- Wa, wa, wa, wa.
- We'll play some more. He likes to get scored on.
- Set the game up.
- Great times.
[Phone Ringing]
- Yeah?
- Better play defense.
Okay. Yeah, it's on the fourth floor.
The elevator's broken, okay?
Dude, it's Pink Dot.
Would you buzz him in? Hit nine.
l wish they still had fights in
this game so l could bitch-slap Wayne.
- They don't have fighting anymore?
- Doesn't that suck?
Why'd they get rid of the fighting?
lt's the best part of the old version.
Kids were hitting each other
or something, man.
But you know what, Mike? You can
make their heads bleed on this one.
- Make somebody's head bleed.
- No, we're in play-offs.
l'm gonna make Wayne Gretzky's head
bleed for super fan number 99 here.
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Mikey, get the door?
- Yeah, give me some money.
- Why do l have to give you money?
Give me some fuckin' money.
l'm not paying again.
Jesus Christ.
Pause the game.
- Dude, l'm about to do my thing with the thing.
- Pause the game!
- l got fuckin' Wayne.
- Pause it!
All right, l'll pause it.
Jesus Christ. Like you scored all day.
- How much do you want?
- Just give me some money.
Okay, fine. Take my last 20.
Here. Jesus fucking Christ.
There it is, Mikey! Check it out.
His head's bleeding.
Mikey, check it out. His legs... Little
Wayne's legs are shaking all over.
- Fucking bitch! What did you do that for?
- You're the fucking bitch!
- What the fuck are you... Why did you un-pause it?
- Come on, man.
- C'mon, peaches.
- Get the fuck off me.
- l'm not kidding.
- You know what? Look at you. Look at you.
- You wanna kiss me. Look at you.
- Get the fuck off.
- Get off!
- Look at you right now.
- Get the fuck off me!
- You're fuckin' makin' me sick! You want to kiss me!
Hey, hold still. Hold on. lt's
the fuckin' Pink Dot guy. Hold on.
[Trent]
Hey, Mikey! Mikey, is he cute?
- [Sue] ls he brown?
- Maybe he'd like to come in and join us for a cocktail.
- ls he polite?
- ls he a brown man?
lf he's polite, have him come in. lf
he's polite, let him in. ls he clean?
Have him come look.
Have him take off his shoes.
Michael, is he clean?
l want to see him!
Michael, l want to see him.
Don't let him go! Don't let him go.
Get off. l'm serious.
Don't fuckin' do that shit.
Oh, he got away from us.
l'm sorry, Michael. Was he nice?
You guys are assholes.
Eat, eat, you fuckin' jackals.
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice.
- What time is the party tonight?
- lt starts at 8:00.
- Everybody'll get there around 10:00.
- So, what, 11:00?
- Midnight.
- Midnight.
l'm gonna bring an old friend
from back home. He just moved out here.
- Who, Rob?
- Yeah, you know him.
Yeah, he's cool.
You'll like him. He's a rounder, Rob.
- What does he do?
- Uh, he's trying to be an actor.
- What a surprise.
- How novel.
[Rob]
So the party started at 8:00.
Why are we going
to a bar at 10:00?
[Mike] To grab a drink before we meet
the guys for a bite at 11:00.
Where is this place?
For some reason the cool bars in Hollywood
have to be hard to find and have no sign.
lt's kind of like a speakeasy
kind of thing. lt's kinda cool.
lt's like you're in on some
kind of secret, you know?
You tell a chick you been someplace, it's
like braggin' that you know how to find it.
[Jazz]
[Continues]
- [Chattering]
- [Woman Laughing]
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
l'll get a Dewars on the rocks.
What are you getting?
- Uh, Budweiser.
- A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud.
God, l can't believe
the women in this city.
lt's like the hottest one percent
from... from all over the world...
come to our gene pool.
Darwinism at its best.
- Yo, Mikey, what's up?
- Charles! How you doin', man?
- Ah, you know, man. You know.
- You get that pilot?
Nah, man. l know you didn't. Otherwise
you wouldn't be askin' me, right?
- That shit wasn't funny anyway.
- Piece of shit.
Charles, this is my friend Rob
from back East. He just moved out here.
- My pleasure.
- How you doin', man?
This is Charles.
We went to network on a pilot.
- Oh, yeah, l tested for one.
- A month ago.
- How'd your folks take it?
- Actually, l haven't heard an official "no" yet.
Oh, so you haven't
told them yet.
That's all right, man. l still haven't told
my folks l didn't get Deep Space Nine.
You figure they'd figure
it out by now, right?
- But Moms keeps asking me.
- Boy, does it hurt when they ask.
l don't even tell them about
anything l'm close on anymore.
Not 'til you book it.
You know, you might get cut out.
l'm considering taking
a part as Goofy.
- Well, at least it's Disney, right?
- Yeah.
Look, we're going to, uh,
we're going to this party in the hills.
Some modeling agency. Beautiful babies.
You want to come with?
Yeah, why not?
This place is dead anyway.
Let's go.
No, no, no, no, no.
Now, you got to admit...
that the Steadicam shot
in GoodFellas was the money.
The basement of the... the restaurant,
the Copa in New York.
- Through the kitchen, Mike. - l heard it
took them four days to light that shot.
[Rob] Four days?
l don't know about four days.
- Well, that's what l heard.
- [Trent] They have to hide all the lights.
Jesus, that must've
cost a fortune.
[Charles] That's nothing. You know how much
money my man spent on that Vegas movie?
[Mike] Wait. You gotta be nuts
to shoot in a casino.
[Trent]
All right, ready. Mean Streets?
- That's the dope.
- Dude, dude. Reservoir Dogs.
- Oh, stop with that fucking Reservoir Dogs.
- Which one?
The one right in the beginning where
they're walking in slow motion, man.
How can you even
compare the two, man?
Tarantino completely bites
everything from Scorsese.
- lt's true.
- He's derivative.
[Trent] You know what?
You gotta admit that did look money.
[Charles] l heard they did
that whole thing for under ten grand.
l don't know what the big deal is. Everybody
steals from everybody. That's movies.
[Mike] Let's get the hell out
of here if we wanna make this party.
Pick up the pieces
Uh-huh
Pick up the pieces
All right
Pick up the pieces
Pick up the pieces
Whoo
[People Chattering]
Pick up the pieces
Pick up the pieces
Pick up the pieces
[Ends]

- So who threw this party anyway?
- Damned if l know.
- Beats me.
- Hey, l came with you.
Nice.

- What's that guy's name again? Sue?
Sue. Yeah. His dad was a big Johnny Cash
fan from what l understand.
- Oh, right, right, right. The song.
- Yeah, "A Boy Named Sue."
So l think that's why
he's such a mean cat.
- That guy?
- Oh, he's a bad guy.
He don't look it. He's... No, he's mean.
l seen him in a fight once.
He had a guy and was fuckin' smackin'
his head into the curb, like his mouth.
Just fuckin' smash. His teeth came out.
Just fucking, wha, wha, wha.
Fuckin' blood came out of
his fuckin' mouth. lt was nasty, man.
- Nice guy, though. That guy's cool.
- Hey, big Mike.
Hey, how're you doing?
What are you doing here?
- Marty invited me here.
- Oh, yeah? Cool, cool.
Thrill me, baby

- No.
- How 'bout now? ls she looking over here now?
- [Chuckles] No.
What about now?
ls she looking now?
No, she's not looking at you, dude. Will you
quit asking me if she's looking at you?
- She hasn't looked at you... Wait, she just looked.
- See what l'm sayin', man?
You understand?
l got some friends l wanna go meet.
l'll talk to you later.
- Nice to see you. l'll give you a call.
- All right. Take care.
- All right, man.
- Who's that?
l don't know, man.
- You know, there's so many beautiful women.
- Unbelievable, dude.
- Unbelievable.
- Okay, l gotta try once.
- You're a better man than l am,
Charlie Brown. - l have to.
- l made a promise to myself.
- Go. Go for it.
l have to get out there sooner
or later, right? So l gotta go now.
- Okay, you're gonna be my wing man?
- l'll be your winger.
Hi. Uh, how are you ladies

She's a brick house
My whole life people have told me
l have this star quality.
- Have they?
- Well, l don't know if it's true.
But, well, this one time...
this is really stupid...
- But in kindergarten, you know...
- lt's all right.
You know how you have those little crushes?
l had this crush on this guy Lee.
He was really cute, and he
wore Lee Jeans. They said "Lee."
Anyway, l really liked him.
And then one day he told me l was ugly.
l started crying,
and my teacher was, like,
"Deidre, you are so emotional.
You are so dramatic.
You should be an actress!"
- ["Jaws Theme"] - lt was, like, that's it!
l should be an actress.
And you know what?
l can cry on cue.
- Yeah! Well, totally.
- Uh-huh.
Well, that's really been sort of my thing, you know.
lt got me into Juilliard.
And the agent said to me
afterwards that he thought...
- he really was reminded by me...
- [Grows Louder]
of Tina Yothers,
you know, from Family Ties.
And he said
l looked just like her.
- [Continues Babbling]
- [Continues]
She's the one, the only one
Built like an Amazon, Yeah
[Laughs]
Was that money or what?
Kind of a dick move,
if you ask me.
Why, baby?
What'd l do wrong?
- You asked a girl for her number and you tore it up.
- She didn't see that.
- lt doesn't matter.
- That was pretty cold, dude.
What was so cold about it?
Right.
[Laughs]
See, man, you can't roll with that.
She's business class.
- Business class?
- Big butt. You know, can't fly coach?
You guys are terrible.
Gentlemen,

- Could hit the Dresden.
Perfect.
Well, this place

Oh, you're...

Yeah.
Yeah, it's a dream, you know. lt's a lot
of hard work and travel and, uh, hotels.
l have a new booking agent, though, so
l'm part of the whole Vegas circuits.
The money's pretty good. l might buy
a car, l think. You know, a foreign car.
Treat myself. l figure
l worked for it. Why not?
l know where it is.
Starbucks.
l served you an espresso
at Starbucks.
Espresso. An espresso. Yes, that's
my drink. That's probably it.
That's great.
lsn't that funny?
You came in and asked me
for an application.
And then l took you and
introduced you to my manager.
Must've been a while ago, 'cause
right now l have a booking agent.
'Cause l've been... l have
a booking agent now that l've got.
- No.
- Yeah.
- lt was about two weeks ago.
- lt was probably more.
Probably longer, 'cause things
have been going very well lately.
l haven't been looking
for a job in a while.
lt could have been someone who looks like me,
'cause there's a lot of people who look kinda...
- See, l have a face that's similar...
- You better pay the man.
Here's the, uh...
Here's... Just take this.
l've been doing very well.
Thank you. Uh, thank you...
- Nikki.
- Nikki. Thank you, Nikki.
Mm-hmm.
- We got digits, baby.
- Yeah, what a surprise.
What's wrong with you? l saw you
talkin' to a beautiful brunette baby.
She didn't like me, okay?
l made a fool of myself.
- Baby, don't talk that way.
- You're so money, and you don't even know it.
- That's what l keep tryin' to tell him.
- Could you not mess with me?
- Baby, we're not messing with you.
- We're not.
You know what you are? You're like
a big bear with claws and fangs, man.
- Big fuckin' teeth, man.
- Yeah, big fuckin' teeth on ya.
She's just like this little bunny who's
just kinda cowering in the corner.
- [Sue] Shivering.
- Yeah, man, just kinda...
You got these claws and you're staring at
these claws, and you're thinkin' to yourself,
with these claws, you're thinkin', "How
am l supposed to kill this bunny?"
You're pokin' at it, man.
You're not hurtin' it. You're just
kinda gently battin' the bunny around.
You know what l mean?
And the bunny's scared of you.
- And it's shivering.
- You got the fucking claws!
These claws and these fangs! You're
looking at your claws and your fangs.
You're thinking to yourself,
"l don't know what to do, man.
"l don't know how to kill the bunny." With
this, you don't know how to kill the bunny!
You're like
a big bear, man.
- So you're not just fuckin' with me?
- No, l'm not fucking with you!
- Honestly!
- Mike, l'm telling you, you're money.
You're so fucking money.
l want you to go over to that girl
and l want you to get those digits.
- You're money.
- Come here a second. Listen to me.
Look it, when you go up
to talk to her, man,
l don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13
movie everyone's really hoping makes it happen.
l want you to be like the guy
in the rated R movie, you know?
The guy you're not sure
whether or not you like yet.
You're not sure where he's coming
from, okay? You're a bad man.
You're a bad man.
You're a bad man.
Bad man.
["Jaws Theme"]
[Grows Louder]
All right, all right.
See, baby,

Nice.

- A day.
- Tomorrow.
- Mm-mmm.
- Tomorrow, then a day.
- Yeah.
- So two days.
- Yeah, l guess you could call it that... two days.
Definitely. Two days
is like industry standard.
l used to wait two days to call anybody, but
now it's like everyone in town waits two days.
So l think three days is kinda money.
What do you think?
- Two's enough not to look anxious.
- Two's enough not to look anxious.
But l think three days
is kinda money.
Maybe l'll wait three weeks.
How's that?
And tell her l was cleaning out my wallet
and l just happened to run into her number.
- Then ask her where you met her.
- Yeah.
l don't remember. What does she look
like? Then l'll ask if we fucked.
Would that...
T, would that be the money?
You know what? Ha, ha, ha, Mike.
Laugh all you want.
But if you call too soon, you might scare
off a nice baby who's ready to party.
- How long are you guys gonna wait to call your babies?
- [Together] Six days.
Different, l don't know, schools of
philosophy, they all can fight each other.
[All Chattering]
- l think l like this town.
- No, no, gotta go to New Orleans.
Hey, how're you doin'?
[Quietly]
Watch where you're going, asshole.
What'd you say, bitch?
l said watch where
you're going, bitch.
- Oh, so you want something.
- [Man] Hey, fucker. Hey.

- Now one of us is gonna get shot.
- He ain't gonna do anything.
- You fuckin' asshole.

What the fuck did you want me to do,
back down? He called me a bitch.
- We kept our rep, bro.
- Fuck rep, man. l got a callback tomorrow.
Yeah, l gotta get up
early tomorrow.
What the fuck are you carrying a gun for?
ln case somebody steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
Hey, man, you're not from here.
You don't know how it is.
- l grew up in L.A.
- Anaheim.
Whatever, man. lt's different out here.
lt's not like New York, Mikey.
Fuckin' A right, it's not like New York.
Out here you can avoid trouble.
lt's not like you live in Compton, Sue,
with bullets whizzing by your head.
You live in a good neighborhood, man.
ln New York trouble finds you.
- People get carjacked.
- Oh, man, who would ever carjack your fuckin' K car?
He's right, Sue.
You don't need to carry a gat.
Just 'cause l had the balls
to stand up to these guys...
Like fuckin' House of Pain
was gonna do anything?
- You like in this fucking fantasy world.
- Wha...
What about you, Mikey?
At least l fuckin' have balls, man.
You're always whining about some bitch
that left you a year ago!
lt was six months ago,
and she didn't leave me.
Whatever, man! You're like
a fuckin' little whiny bitch, man.
Oh, whoopee, you got a number tonight?
You're gonna fuck it up.
- Hey, Sue.
- No. Have you gotten laid once since you moved out here?
- Have you fucked once?
- Why don't you shut the fuck up for a little bit?
l know for a fact that you haven't.
You know how l know?
- 'Cause you never shut up about it!
- Shut the fuck up, Sue!
- Ah, he's fuckin' right.
- Shut up! Hey, Mike, come here.
Mike, come back here!
Mike, come back here!
- He was fuckin' pissing me off!
- Just shut the fuck up.
Just shut the fuck up. l don't even

[Machine Beeps]
Hey, Mikey, it's Trent.
You home? You there?
All right, man,
l guess you're not home.
Why don't you come out tonight, Mikey?
l haven't seen you for two days.
We're gonna play hockey
at Sue's house until 10:30,
and then we're either going to
the Lava Lounge for Sinatra Night...
or we'll be at the Derby
for Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.
We might also check out
Swing Night at the El Rey.
And if we're not there we'll be
at the Three of Clubs, all right?
Otherwise we'll be at the Dresden Room,
so come on out and meet up with us.
- See you soon, gorgeous.

[Sighs]
Thanks, man.
You eat anything today?
Yesterday?
You haven't been drinking,
have you?
[Mike Mutters, lndistinct]
- Sorry about what happened at the Dresden, man.
- Oh, don't worry about it, man.
lt's like, now l have my L.A. gun story.
[Chuckles]
You should hear the way l tell it
to the guys back home... it's an Uzi.
- You wanna talk about it?
- What's the point?
Hey, it's been two days.
You should call that Nikki girl.
Not your type.
l'm thinking of
moving back East.
- Well, that's dumb.
- What's so dumb about it?
You're doing really well
out here, Mike.
How well am l doin'?
l host an open mike;
l play a fuckin' bus driver in a movie.
Big fuckin' deal.
l got an agent
that specializes in magicians.
How good am l doin'?
Did you get turned down
for Goofy?
They turned you down?
Yeah, they went with somebody who had
some more theme park experience.
l killed for that job.
The point is, Mike, it all depends
on how you look at it. All right?
You're telling me that your life sucks.
That means mine is god-awful.
Part of the reason l moved out here
is l saw how well you were doing,
and l figured if you could
make it, l could too.
- l didn't make it.
- You got an agent. You got in the unions.
You know, that's your problem,
is that you...
You don't look at
the things that you have.
You only look at the stuff
you don't have.
Those guys are right about you.
You're money.
Then why won't she call?
She won't call
because you left.
She's got her own life to deal with,
man, and that's in New York.
She's a sweet girl
and l love her to pieces,
but fuck her, man...
you gotta get on with your life.
You gotta let go of the past, and Mikey,
when you do the future is beautiful.
All right?
Look out the window.
lt's sunny every day here.
lt's like manifest destiny.
Don't tell me we didn't make it.
We made it. We are here.
Everything that is past
is prologue to this.
All of the shit that
didn't kill us is only...
Ah, you know.
All that shit.
You're gonna get over it.
How did you get over it?
How long did it take?
l don't know.
Sometimes it still hurts.
You know how it is, man.
lt's like...
You wake up every day,
it hurts a little bit less,
then you wake up one day
and it doesn't hurt at all.
And the funny thing is...
This is kinda weird,
but it's like...
you almost miss that pain.
You miss the pain?
Yeah, for the same reason
that you miss her.
Because you... you lived
with it for so long.
Let's go get
something to eat.
All right. Sure.
You look like shit.

You're not a real man?
Not lately, no.
Not funny, okay?
- You're fuckin' hurting feelings here.
- Hey, it's on. lt's on.
- [Sue] Oh. lt's on.

[Both Gasp]

Yeah. You said there are
advantages to being single.

Well, exactly, it's like,
you know, you, uh, have com...
lf you meet a girl in a bar and talk to her, you
don't have to worry if anybody's watching you.
What else?
What? You can do
whatever you want, you know.
You grow, go out, anything.
Like, if l met a handsome
young man at a bar,
l could just ask him to dance?
lf the guy wanted to, yeah.
You don't think
he would want to?
Oh, yeah... No, l mean, he would
want to with you. Sure. l mean, if he...
Sure. M-M-Maybe it's just that
he doesn't feel like dancing.
Would you dance with me?
Okay.
Dude, check it out, dude.

[Chuckles]
Didn't you tell me that
l should be patient with my career?
Yeah, but entertainment law

- Why? You like the duck with the cigar?
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's the logo
from You Bet Your Life.

Do you know how hard it is
to not call you?
l mean, l pick up the phone every night,
whenever that commercial comes on.
- The Michelin commercial?
- Yeah, you know, the one with the baby in the tire.
- One time l started to cry right in front of Pierre.
- Pierre?
Th-That's his name, Pierre?

lt's at The Room.
lt's Sinatra's birthday.
And it's one of these Hollywood clubs

Uh, l don't understand why...

l'm really bad at this.
l just want to know

- [Trent] So, uh, you hung up on which one?
- [Mike] Michelle.
- You hung up with your girlfriend.
- Ex.
- Oh, now she's your ex.
- She was always my ex.
Yeah, right.
- You hung up with her?
- l wanted to take the other call.
- What'd she say when you called her back?
- l didn't.
- You didn't call her back?
- No.
- Why not, Mike?
- lt didn't occur to me.
Didn't occur to you.
lt didn't.
You been, uh, tearing yourself
up about this girl for six months.
Didn't occur to you?
No.
Well, Michael, l'll bite.
You know, man, l didn't understand
it either. lt's all so hard.
Then it hit me on the way over here,
you know, like a ton of bricks.
lt's just so simple.
- When you...
- Dude, dude, wait a second.
l'm getting vibe like
in a really weird way here.
This girl's looking at me
like she knows me a little bit.
- You don't recognize her?
- Mike, l don't know.
l could've been out with Sue one night
drinking and told her l was a race car driver.
No, l think l would
remember this girl.
l don't think l've ever met her before.
l would definitely remember this one.
She got a lot of confidence, man.
She's doing like...
- Wow. [Laughs]
- What's going...
Mike, stop, stop.
Stop, all right? Just stop.
She's playing a little game,
like a fun thing with me.
Come on, you little party girl.
That's it. Come on. Fun little games?
You want to play fun little games? Come
on, you nasty little, cute little baby.
- What are you doing?
- Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike. Stop. Don't. Don't, don't.
She's smiling at me.
She's playing fun little baby games.
She don't know me. She doesn't
know my address. You know my address?
You little...
Oh, you... Hold on.
She's coming over, dude.
Play it cool. She's coming over.
She's like the wild loony. But l threw, like,
the great vibe at her, the funny vibe.
- You'll see.
- [Babbling]
- Shit.
- Mommy's big boy.
We're going bye-bye now.
Yes, we're going bye-bye.
We're gonna go home,
gonna play with Daddy.
So, um, so you
called her up, right?
Or you didn't call her. Why didn't you
call her? You said you didn't call her.
Why didn't you call her? Mike?
Mike?
l never cared much
for moonlit skies
Never winked back
at fireflies
But now that the stars
are in your eyes
l'm beginnin'
to see the light
And l never went in
for afterglow
Or candlelight
on the mistletoe
But now when you turn
the lamp down low
l'm beginnin'
to see the light
l used to ramble
through the park
Shadowboxin' in the dark
Then you came
and caused the spark
That's a four-alarm fire now
l never made love
by lantern shine
l never saw rainbows
in my wine
But now that your lips
are burnin' mine
l'm beginnin'
to see the light
l never cared much
for moonlit skies
l never winked back
at fireflies
But now that the stars
are in your eyes
l'm beginnin'
to see the light
And l never went in
for afterglow
Or candlelight
on the mistletoe
But now when you turn
the lamp down low
l'm beginnin'
to see the light
You know, l used to ramble
through the park
Shadowboxin' in the dark
Then you came
and lit that spark
That's a four-alarm fire now
And l never made love
by lantern shine
Never saw rainbows
in my wine
But now that your lips
are burnin' mine
l'm beginnin'
Mm, to see the light
