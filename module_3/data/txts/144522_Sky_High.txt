in a world full of superheroes.
The Commander and Jetstream.
His super-strength makes him
pretty much indestructible.
She has the power of supersonic flight
along with the mastery
of unarmed combat.
By day. they live
as Steve and Josie Stronghold.
the top real estate agents
in the metropolis of Maxville.
But whenever duty calls. they are
the Commander and Jetstream.
Me. i have my own names for them:
Mom and Dad.
That's me in the middle.
You look at them and see
the defenders of the world.
All i see is my dad wearing tights.
Don't get me wrong.
it can be cool
to have superhero parents.
like when Mom picks up
awesome takeout
on her way home from work.
On the other hand.
living up to the family name
means i'm supposed
to save the world someday.
Here we go.
i just have one small problem.
Come on.
Come on.
Exactly what we want to hear.
Well, that was Bert Timmerman,
and he is buying the
colonial on Pine Terrace.
Above asking. No contingencies.
Honey, l know that selling
real estate is just our cover,
but l think we're in line to win
that sales trip to Hawaii.
We haven't been to Hawaii since King
Kamehamayhem set off that volcano.
Think of it, Josie,
you, me on the beach,
no exploding volcanoes.
l can feel the sand in my toes already.
Will is gonna be down any minute.
Hey, it's his first day
of school. Where is he?
Will?
Will?
Come on, buddy. Let's get moving!
Two hundred.
Oh, hey, Dad. Just trying to
get a few sets in before school.
Low weights, high rep, huh?
Good thinking. Don't want to bulk up.
No, going more for definition.
Big day, huh?
Will?
l just want you
to know how proud l am
that you'll be attending my alma mater
and someday following me
into the family business.
Real estate?
Right.
Real estate.
On a more serious note, son,
l know that every kid
thinks his dad's invincible
and l nearly am, but who knows?
Maybe the next time l punch
a meteor hurtling toward Earth,
l'll be the one who shatters
into a million pieces.
l guess all l'm trying
to say here, Will,
is it's nice to know
that whatever happens to me,
you'll still be around
to save the world.
- Looking forward to it.
- We all are.
Oh, hey.
Good morning, Mrs. Stronghold.
Morning.
l saw you had
recyclables in the trash.
l took the liberty
of moving them for you.
Thank you, Layla. You hungry?
l've got plenty of eggs, bacon.
No, thanks. You know how my mom
can communicate with animals?
Apparently, they don't like being eaten.
- How about some juice?
- Great.
He's on his way. Oh, hi, Layla.
- Good morning, Commander.
- Commander?
Oh, thanks, Layla.
l can't believe you're
starting high school.
Seems like yesterday you were
swimming naked in the kiddie pool.
Mom!
Hi, Layla.
Thank you.
Josie. lt's the other one.
Go.
l see.
Thank you, mayor.
There's trouble downtown.
Big trouble. Downtown.
Oh, shoot, and l really wanted
to see Will off to the bus.
l remember his first day of preschool.
He wouldn't let go of my leg.
Mom!
Josie.
Oh, Will,
a reminder.
A lot of the kids at Sky High
will only have one
superhero parent, not two,
so take it easy on them.
No showing off.
Dad. Not to worry.
l'll keep it low-key.
Mrs. Rivera? Josie Stronghold.
l'm gonna need to
reschedule that open house.
Great.
- Steve!
- Got to go!
...reports of a situation downtown.
Let's check with a picture
from News Chopper Five.
Evil has struck our morning commute.
lf you're traveling eastbound
on the 1 1 5,
you might think about
taking alternate routes.
Hang on. This just in. The Commander
and Jetstream are on their way.
Are you sure he'll be OK?
What if he forgets his lunch?
Josie, Josie, you've got
to stop babying the boy.
You're right, you're right.
Left. Left!
- Circle back around!
- l'm on it.
Release!
Launch!
And the robot goes down!
He's plucking out a souvenir
from a successful battle.
What a team.
The Commander and Jetstream.
What would we do without them?
- Coming up. a bakery...
- They are good.
Now, l know it's just our first day,
but l already can't wait to graduate
and start saving mankind.
And womankind. And animalkind.
- And the rain forest.
- Of course.
- Hello, kids.
- Hi, Mrs. Kibbitch.
l just feel really good about this year.
Yeah. Should be great.
- Morning.
- Morning.
ls this the bus to Sky High?
What are you, crazy?
l guess you want every supervillain
to know we're here.
No, no. Sorry.
What's your name, freshman?
Will Stronghold.
The son of the Commander
and Jetstream?
Everyone. lt's Will Stronghold.
Son of the Commander and Jetstream.
l'm Ron Wilson,
Sky High bus driver.
lf l can make your journey more
comfortable, let me know. You two. Up.
The seat behind Ron Wilson
is Will Stronghold's.
lt would be an honor.
- lt's fine. You don't have to.
- l want to. You're third generation.
Magenta, get up.
- Why? He only needs one seat.
- So he can sit with his girlfriend.
Layla? No, she's just my friend.
Yeah, totally.
He's like my brother.
Oh, well,
in that case, hi. l'm Larry.
Yo, Will. Hey, how you doing?
Hey, Layla.
- How you doing? How was your summer?
- To be honest, it was tough.
T-U-P-H. l mean, l was seriously
sweating it. My dad going, ''Zach,
l powered up before l started shaving.''
And here's me, dude,
halfway through August...
...and zip.
Oh, so you don't have your powers.
You think l'd even show up today
if that happened?
No. No, no.
Woke up a few days ago,
and bam!
That's great. So, what is it?
You have to wait and see
like everybody else.
But it's awesome, man.
lt's awesome.
- Hi.
- Come on. lt's not like
you ever powered up in front of us.
Sorry.
Morning.
That's everyone.
Next stop, Sky High!
Where are we?
Hang on back there.
We're going off-road.
Here we go.
Freshmen.
There she is. Sky High.
Kept aloft by the latest in
antigravitational propulsion.
She's in constant motion
as a precaution against those
who might have nefarious plans,
her location supplied
only to highly qualified individuals
such as myself,
Ron Wilson, bus driver.
Smooth and easy.
Sorry.
Word of advice. Don't miss the bus,
'cause the bus waits for no one.
Except for you, Will Stronghold.
You ever running late or early
or you just want to talk...
- ...give me a call.
- Thanks, Ron.
Seriously.
- Yeah, Freeze-Girl.
- Hello. freshmen. don't be shy
Welcome newbies to Sky High
Juniors. seniors. all the rest
We're back to school
Sky is the best
Ready, one, two, three.
We're number one!
- Sky High! We're number one!
- l hate that cheer.
Speed, round them up, OK?
Hey, freshmen.
Your attention, please.
l'm Lash. This is Speed.
As representatives of
the welcoming committee...
We'd be happy to collect
that $1 5 new student fee.
There was nothing about
a new student fee in the handbook.
OK, guys. Very funny.
l'll take over from here.
Hey, everybody. l'm Gwen Grayson,
your student body president.
l know you're all going
to love it here at Sky High.
l know l have.
l've just had the greatest experience,
and l've made the greatest friends.
There are a few rules
that l just want to let you guys know.
First of all...
lf you can remember those few rules,
l promise you will not fall
off the edge of the school.
Now just follow me inside
for orientation.
- What rules?
- Weren't you paying attention?
Good morning. l am Principal Powers.
On behalf of all the faculty and staff,
welcome to Sky High.
Yeah!
ln a few moments you will
go through Power Placement,
and your own
heroic journey will begin.
- ''Power placement''?
- Sounds fascist.
Power Placement: it's how
they decide where you go.
The hero track or the loser track.
There's a loser track?
l believe the preferred term
is ''Hero Support.''
For now, good deeds and good luck.
Let the adventure begin.
Comets away!
All right, listen up.
My name is Coach Boomer.
You may know me as ''Sonic Boom.''
You may not.
Here's how Power Placement
is gonna work.
You will step up here
and show me your power.
Yes, you will do so
in front of the entire class.
l will then determine
where you will be assigned.
Hero or sidekick.
Now, every year
there are a few students
or as l like to call them,
''whiner babies,''
who see fit to question
and to complain
about their placement.
So let's get one thing straight.
My word is law.
My judgment is final,
so there will be no whiner babies.
Are we clear?
l said, are we clear?!
Yes, Coach Boomer!
Go-time!
You. What's your name?
Larry.
Little Larry.
Get up here.
What's humiliating him
going to prove? This is unfair.
lf life were to suddenly get fair,
l doubt it would happen in high school.
Car.
Big Larry. Hero.
So he's good. But l'm better.
Did l say you were next?
Name's Zach, Coach Boomer.
Try not to drop your clipboard.
Any day now, superstar.
- l'm doing it.
- Doing what?
- l'm glowing.
- l don't think so.
Well, it's easier to see in a dark room.
Maybe we could turn off these lights.
Cup your hands around
your eyes and look real close...
- Sidekick.
- Are you sure you don't want to...?
Sidekick!
You. Front and center.
- Let me say what an honor it is to...
- ls that your power?
- Butt-kissery?
- Funny.
- l heard you had a wicked...
- Shut up and power up.
Right away.
Say, that's pretty impressive...
...for a Popsicle. Sidekick.
Hero.
Sidekick.
Super spit?
Sidekick.
Acid spit.
Hero.
Hero.
And a handsome one at that.
Get out of here, knucklehead!
Purple kid. Let's go.
- What's your shtick?
- l'm a shape-shifter.
OK. Shift it.
- A guinea pig?
- Yep.
Not even a swarm of guinea pigs?
No.
Sidekick. Shoo!
- Bite me.
- You. Flower child.
- Let's go.
- l believe in only using my powers
when the situation demands it.
Well, you're in luck.
This is the situation,
and l'm demanding it.
To participate in this test would
be to support a flawed system.
The hero-sidekick dichotomy
- only serves to...
- Let me get this straight.
- Are you refusing to show your powers?
- lt's more complicated.
Sidekick!
All right, we'll pick it up
right after lunch, starting with you.
That's not cool. l'm telling you,
Boomer's gonna regret
making me a sidekick.
Someday it'll be dark,
he'll be all alone, walking to his car.
He'll drop his keys, and l
won't glow to help him find them.
You got a problem with me?
- No.
- No what?
No, sir. No, sir! No, sir!
Just messing with you, sidekick.
You're not supposed to use
your powers outside of the gym.
The cafeteria staff requests sidekicks
stop ordering hero sandwiches.
Am l crazy, or is that guy
looking at me?
- Dude.
- What?
- That's Warren Peace.
- That's Warren Peace?
- Yeah.
- l've heard about him.
His mom's a hero and
his dad's a supervillain. Baron Battle.
- Where do l come in?
- Your dad busted his dad.
Quadruple life sentence.
No parole until after his third life.
That's great.
lt's my first day of Sky High,
and l already have an archenemy.
ls he still looking?
- No.
- No?
No.
You said he wasn't looking.
A reminder: There is no smoking
on school grounds.
or freezing or bursting into flame.
l'm...
Will Stronghold.
Mind reader.
No. Name tag.
Right.
- These are my friends. That's Zach.
- What's up?
- And this is...
- Layla. Got it.
- l'm Gwen.
- Hi.
- l love your skirt.
- Thanks.
- How's Power Placement going?
- Great.
l'm not surprised.
l need a freshman rep
for the homecoming committee.
lf you're interested,
we could talk over lunch sometime.
l eat lunch.
How cute is he?
- l guess l'll see you guys around.
- Yeah.
- Bye.
- Bye.
l don't think she really liked my skirt.
See you.
And thanks for the swirly.
- What's up, guys?
- The kid...
...looked a little dehydrated.
How about it, Stronghold?
You gonna hang with us this year?
Help us bring some pain
to the sidekicks?
That's... That sounds like fun.
Good man. See you around.
OK.
...what it actually is...
What do you mean, you don't
know what your power is?
Well...
l got it.
You're messing with the coach.
Just like your old man. Car!
- Wow.
- That was close.
Are you insane?!
l don't have super-strength.
Oh, l get it.
You're a flier, like your ma.
Why didn't you say so?
Quit messing around.
l haven't got all day.
- What's your power?
- l don't have one.
Stronghold.
Side... kick!
l remember doing this to your father
when he was just your age.
Kicked me through that wall.
You haven't called him yet, have you?
Like l want to be the one to tell the
Commander his son has no powers?
Let's... Let's take
a look at that chest.
Well, nothing seems to be broken.
Except for me not having my powers.
Well,
maybe you're just a late bloomer.
Could get one of them or both.
Your mother's flying or
your father's super-strength.
But when?
The kids who get bit
by radioactive insects
or fall into
a vat of toxic waste,
their powers usually
show up the next day.
Or they die.
Oh, lookit.
But kids who
inherit their powers...
...well, impossible to say.
But l will get them, right?
Many sidekicks
are the offspring
of one super-parent
and one ordinary parent.
But there are cases,
rare, yet not unheard of,
where the child of two
super-powered parents...
...never acquires...
...any... powers
whatsoever.
There are?
Like who?
Well, l know of only one.
Ron Wilson, bus driver?
There he is.
There he is now.
A three-and-a-half bath Victorian
with original crown molding?
You bet we'd love
to take a look. How's...
When are we briefing the president
on supervillain infiltration of the lRS?
President would be Monday.
Tuesday? Great.
No, thank you, Linda.
Hon, dinner's almost ready.
Stop playing with your robot eye
- and help set the table.
- Sure.
- Oh, there he is.
- Hey.
- Man of the hour.
- Well, how'd it go?
Dad, we need to talk.
A little hero-to-hero talk?
l think l know
just the place. Come on.
Hon?
- OK, so, Dad...
- Oh, this isn't the place, Will.
This...
...is the place.
No way. The secret sanctum?
You know, l'll never forget
my first day at Sky High.
Your grandfather
finally trusted me enough
to give me the key
to his secret sanctum.
Of course, in those days,
we still used keys.
Go ahead, son.
l already added
your biometrics this morning.
Oh, Will, one thing.
Of course, you must never ever
bring anyone into the secret sanctum.
That's why it's called
the secret sanctum.
l would never.
Go for it.
Oh, this one's mine, Will.
- You can use Mom's.
- Sorry.
No way.
You've got a pool table?
How about the pinball machine?
- Man.
- Let's see. Where do l start?
l don't know.
Over here we got Mom's stuff.
Scientific equipment,
gadgetry, whatnot.
Will? Oh, yeah.
All our greatest battles.
Our finest moments.
Ticranium's head.
Exo's number-one bug-bot.
- And is this...?
- Royal Pain's Pacifier.
Now that was a great day, Will.
The first time your mom and l
ever teamed up to fight evildoers.
As soon as she came smashing
through the window.
i knew she was the one for me.
i wish you could have seen us.
We were fantastic!
Royal Pain got his.
and i got the Pacifier.
And this is my proudest possession.
- Well, it's amazing.
- Well.
- What's it do?
- No idea.
So this is it. lt's all down here.
Our story, your mom and me,
of, well, kicking butt
and taking names.
But now it's time
for a new chapter in the story.
The three of us,
fighting crime together
side by side... by side.
Now, what was it you
wanted to tell me about?
That l'm gonna kick
your butt at pool.
- Well, we'll see about that.
- OK.
Choose your weapon, sir. l'll break.
- There it is.
- You got the right one.
You were right.
He took it home.
Hey, he's got the ego
the size of a giant robot.
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
- Hey, Layla.
- Hi.
Where were you after school?
l was worried.
l got stuck in the nurse's office.
The news just keeps
getting better and better.
Turns out l may never get my powers.
How'd your dad take it?
What should l do?
He showed me the secret sanctum.
You have to tell them.
My parents are the greatest
superheroes on the planet.
- Everybody expects greatness from me.
- Well, you are great.
Thanks.
OK, so you're a sidekick.
lt's not the end of the world.
When life gives you lemons...
Make apple juice?
l can't make lemons.
l don't know what it is.
Yeah, but see, no.
You have an awesome power.
You could have made hero easy.
l'm not into labels.
But why would you
choose to be a sidekick?
Because l think
the whole thing is stupid.
Dividing people into groups
like that. l mean...
- ...what is this?
- High school?
Apple?
Thanks.
Morning, class.
Welcome to Hero Support.
My name is...
...All-American Boy!
Of course, nowadays...
...l just go by Mr. Boy.
This year, it's gonna be my privilege
to help each of you become
the very best hero support
that you can be.
Without hero support,
why, there wouldn't be any heroes.
All right, there
probably would be heroes,
but they would be very lonely.
Lonely heroes indeed. And...
Yes?
Yeah,
when do we pick
our names and costumes?
Because l call dibs on ''Zach Attack.''
Well, you don't get to pick.
On graduation day,
you'll be assigned to your hero,
and then he or she
will decide what you will be called
and what you will wear.
l think this is mostly done in an
attempt to avoid clashing colors.
That's why when l was paired with...
...the Commander,
red, white and blue it was,
which for me was a very
good thing because,
as you can see, blue
really just makes my eyes pop.
lt's very dramatic.
Excuse me. l didn't know
you worked for the Commander.
l worked with the Commander.
We were a team,
Mr... Mr. Stronghold.
Stronghold.
You Steve's son?
Yeah.
And he never mentioned me to you.
l don't... l don't think so.
Makes sense.
That makes perfect sense
because the Commander
does not have time to sit around
flipping through scrapbooks
that l took the time to make for him.
No, the Commander's got
to be out there saving the world.
With your mom. Your mom.
She ever mention me?
lncoming!
Oh, look. He does glow.
l told you.
Greetings. Little misfire
in the Mad Science Lab.
No need to panic,
unless you're a single-cell organism.
Mr. Medulla,
we in Hero Support
are trained never to panic.
My bad.
l'll get the nurse,
unless she's injured.
Change... and ho!
Now you. Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go back.
OK, number one. ''A radioactive zombie
is charging at your hero.
Do you hand him:
A, his silver-tipped crossbow,
B, a wooden spike, C...''
Yo, that's so weak, man.
l'm holding his crossbow.
Why can't l shoot him myself?
Because we're hero support.
And if your hero asks for a crossbow,
- hand it to him.
- Or her.
By the way, Zach,
you can't kill a zombie.
You can only re-kill him.
- Or her.
- lf you kids are all in here,
- who's out there, saving the world?
- Dad. Why are you home so early?
After stopping the Superdome collapse,
l was watching the game and thought,
''lt's been a while since Will and l
tossed the old pigskin around.''
l thought l'd hustle home,
but l see you and Layla
- have already made some new friends.
- lt's an honor to meet you, sir.
Your name, your power?
- l'm Ethan, and l melt.
- OK.
- Zach. l glow.
- l see.
Magenta. l shape-shift.
- Shape-shift.
- lnto a guinea pig.
Great. Great.
Great. Great. Really great.
Well,
l make a mean
tuna fish salad sandwich.
- Anybody want one?
- No, no, no.
Pleasure meeting everyone.
They're a good bunch of kids, Will.
- Yeah.
- Could l ask you something, though?
Does that one kid really,
you know, glow?
Sometimes.
Boy, they have really lowered
the bar some for superheroes
at that school since l went there.
Well, actually, he's a sidekick.
Oh, well, that makes sense.
Yeah. Actually,
they're all sidekicks.
Good for you, son.
Kid of your stature hanging out
with a bunch of sidekicks.
As a freshman? l didn't have the guts.
l can only imagine what your grandfather
would have said if l'd have
brought some of them home.
You know, there's nothing wrong
- with being a sidekick, Dad.
- No. Of course not. l used to have one.
Saved my life once too.
Old... What's-his-name.
So then you would be fine with...
...if l was a sidekick.
Well, yeah, sure, l guess.
Hey, hand me that mayonnaise there.
Well, that's good then,
because... Because l am.
Am what?
A sidekick.
Who is?
Me. Dad?
Dad, l'm a sidekick, OK?
l washed out of Power Placement.
Washed out!
Boomer.
Couldn't make the big time,
so now he thinks
he can pass judgment on
some real heroes' kids, huh?
Oh, it's a power trip, Will.
That's all it is. Sonic Boom?
Try ''Gym Teacher Man.''
No, Dad. What are you doing?
Calling the school.
The tuition we pay them?!
Dad, don't.
Dad.
lt's not Coach Boomer.
lt's me, OK?
l don't have any powers.
But you never said... l mean,
- you made it seem like...
- Like l had super-strength like you?
But l don't.
But you will, Will.
You're just...
You're just a late bloomer.
That's what it is.
Maybe. Maybe not.
But l don't care.
Because, really,
the fact of the matter is
l'm proud to be a sidekick.
Actually, l'm proud
to be hero support.
So l think we...
...pretty much covered the undead.
What's next?
What?
''Your hero flies north
at 300 miles per hour for 1 5 minutes.
His archenemy is tunneling south
at 200 miles per hour for ten minutes.
lf he has x-ray vision, how long before
he realizes he's going the wrong way?''
All l ever wanted for him
was to save the world,
to just feel that once.
That's a lot to put on
a 1 4-year-old's shoulders.
Oh, come on, Josie.
When l was his age, l could
put a truck on my shoulders.
Honey, l know you're disappointed.
So am l. You think l
didn't want to see my son fly?
- Or have super-strength?
- Or fly?
But we can't change who he is.
Not without dropping him
in a vat of toxic waste.
Steve!
Oh, no, l... Where would
we even find a vat of...
- Steve!
- l just... l'm thinking.
Will is a great kid.
This is not the end
of the world. OK.
So maybe we won't be
the Stronghold Three,
the greatest family of superheroes
the world has ever known.
But we will be the Stronghold Three,
the greatest family
the world has ever known.
You're right. You're right,
and he can always go into real estate.
Welcome to Sky Hi...
What's wrong, Ron?
Hey, big boy. Where's your hat?
Hey, where's your hat?
lf you won't respect me,
at least respect the hat.
Guys. Guys, come on.
Give Ron his hat back.
All right. You're the sidekick.
Give him his hat back.
We'll catch you later, Stronghold.
Hey, race you up the steps.
Thanks, Will.
Sure, Ron.
- Over here.
- Saved you a seat.
Hey, and l saved you a pudding.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, buddy. Check this out.
- Sorry.
- You will be.
- Let's not do this.
- Think you can do what you want
- because your name's Stronghold?
- Sorry my dad put your dad in jail...
Nobody talks about my father.
Oh, it is so on.
- Fight, fight, fight.
- Mr. Boy, do something.
l'm on it.
Principal Powers!
Principal Powers! Principal Powers!
Principal Powers! Principal Powers!
Fight, fight, fight!
Move.
Get out of the way.
Where are your sidekicks, sidekick?
Right here.
Yeah.
Leave them alone!
He's strong.
l'm strong?
He's super-strong.
Yeah, Will!
Now, who tripped me?
Stronghold!
What if l said it's not just her twin?
lt's her evil twin.
- This Friday, you say?
- Medulla, you dog.
Think l can't take a hit?
Will!
Will! Pull the pin!
He's coming, man!
Hi.
l didn't do anything. He started it.
Your dad started it,
and l'm gonna finish it.
Don't bother. The Detention Room
neutralizes all super-powers. Sit.
Now, here at Sky High
we do everything we can
to teach you
how to use your powers.
But what you do with them,
that's up to you.
Living up to your father's
reputation or trying
to live it down
is a sad waste of talent.
Your talent.
Try to keep that in mind
the next time you're about
to do something stupid.
All right, look.
Whatever happened with our dads,
it has nothing to do with us.
What do you say?
l say
if you ever cross me again,
l'll roast you alive.
So, Will, anything interesting
happen at school today?
Well, as you may have noticed,
l got my powers today.
Yes, we know. The principal called.
OK. Look, it's not...
lt's not as bad as it sounds.
lt's a really funny,
- great story.
- You nearly destroyed the cafeteria.
Yeah, but, Mom... l got my powers.
And do you know how
to use them wisely?
Sanctum. Now.
William Theodore Stronghold...
...come here.
You're... You're not mad?
My boy has super-strength.
How can l be mad?
l'm sorry.
- You are strong.
- Yeah.
lf your mom asks,
you tell her l read you
the riot act, and...
...l took away your Xbox.
- But l don't have an Xbox.
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.
- When did you...?
- What?
- Open it up.
Here. Here, l'll get it.
All right. Let's see.
The boy has Stronghold's power.
- lt's almost poetic.
- We should crush them now.
- We know he has the weapon.
- Patience!
We have waited this long.
When the time is right,
we'll have our revenge.
You know, time would move
a lot faster if we had an Xbox.
Uncle. Uncle. Uncle.
Dude, you made sidekick history.
Dude, you made sidekick history.
l don't know about that.
Seriously. From now on,
people mess with us at their own peril.
You're breaking down barriers,
proving we're not heroes and sidekicks.
- We're just people.
- Super people.
Seats, please.
We have a lot to cover this morning,
starting with motorcycle sidecar basics.
Except for you, Mr. Stronghold.
Would you gather your gear
and come up here?
l've got your new class schedule.
Congratulations. You've been
transferred to the Hero class.
And by the way, if you should find
yourself needing any hero support,
l still do a little freelance.
But what about them?
- We'll still see you on the bus.
- We'll hang at lunch.
After you dunk Ethan's head
in the toilet.
Well, you best not be late.
Just go already.
Rays!
From the silliness of the shrink ray
to the devastation of the death ray.
These are the very foundations
of Mad Science.
Yes? They told me you were coming.
Unfortunately,
all the lab partners are taken.
l suppose l could pair you
with my teaching assistant.
Miss Grayson?
My apologies.
Come on. Come on. Quickly,
quickly, quickly. Feet.
You stepped on my foot.
OK, how's that?
Perfect. lf you're building a heat ray.
You're supposed to be
building a freeze ray.
OK, l have no idea what l'm doing.
Dreadful technique.
You've confused rays with beams. D!
Minus! l'd give you an F,
but that would only mean having
to see you in summer school.
And what have we here?
Well, l don't know. l didn't do it.
You're far too modest,
Mr. Stronghold.
Or perhaps not modest enough.
Miss Grayson, in the future,
please allow the students
to succeed, or fail,
on their own.
- How did you do that?
- l'm a Technopath.
l can control technology with my mind.
Wow. All l can do is punch stuff.
Yet he'll be
the one on cereal boxes.
Show me the justice in that.
Miss Fernandez, kindly
thaw out Mr. Hellman.
- That was amazing.
- So is what you did in the cafeteria.
Once they start handing out grades
for destruction of school property,
l'll be in good shape.
l can totally help you out
with all this science stuff.
Yeah, you'd do that?
l could be, like, your private tutor.
Cool.
Guys. Guys. Over here.
Will? Sitting with Gwen Grayson?
Man aims high. Gotta give him that.
Sorry. All full.
That's OK.
l think l see
an empty table over there.
Come on, guys.
No offense, Will.
We are not running a loser
outreach program. OK?
l'm sorry. Penny can be a little...
...full of herself sometimes.
Penny...
Sometimes you have to act nice...
l just don't want them
to sit over here.
OK. Just be careful.
Layla. What's up?
Hey, you smell nice.
Tecomaria capensis. Honeysuckle?
- Listen. About lunch...
- What about it?
No, at the table, Penny was being...
- Please. Not a big deal.
- No, it is, and...
l feel bad,
so let me make it up to you.
Maybe tonight we can go
to the Paper Lantern?
But you hate Chinese food.
But you don't.
Paper Lantern, 8:00.
Will!
No, guys.
Come on, buddy. Easy, guys.
- Thanks, Will.
- All right.
You OK?
- Yeah, thanks.
- Zach too.
Come on.
Not so tough when
my boy's around, are you?
You just think you're so big
and bad, huh, Stronghold?
- No, l don't.
- Please. Will will totally take you.
Saw what happened to Warren?
Want a piece?
Watch it. That big mouth
is gonna get you in trouble.
- l didn't say anything.
- Let's settle this in P.E.
- Settle what?
- You're on.
lf Will beats you in Save the Citizen,
you lay off of sidekicks.
lf he loses, you can dunk Ethan
in the toilet every day till graduation.
- Yeah!
- You got yourself a deal.
- Wait, guys, guys.
- Bring it.
Come on. Guys, are you crazy?
No freshman won Save the Citizen,
and they're undefeated.
And you barely know
how to use your powers.
Sorry. Not helping.
Will, you have no choice.
You can't let them dunk
Ethan's head in the toilet. Not again.
The dunking must end.
Five! Four!
Three! Two! One!
Hey, what's up?
Ramirez, Hamilton.
Your citizen has just been mulched
because you failed
to defeat your villains.
Next round. Speed, Lash,
you want to be heroes or villains?
- Villains.
- Yeah.
Oh, there's a surprise.
Who do you want to beat next?
All right. We'll take little Stronghold
and, let's see...
And we pick Peace.
Remember when we used real citizens?
Yes. Yes.
Hothead, Stronghold.
You're the heroes.
Hey!
Get your head in the game.
Three minutes to immobilize
your opponents
- and save the citizen.
- Save me.
- Ready.
- Save me.
Set.
Battle!
What now, Peace?
Hey! Coach, that's a foul.
- Call something on that.
- Save me. Save me.
Watch it, hothead!
What? No. Wait.
No. Wait.
Hey!
Save the citizen.
- Save me.
- You are so dead.
Save me.
Save me.
Save me.
The vortex sucks away the oxygen.
No oxygen, no flame.
Come on!
Save me.
Save me.
Save me.
Five! Four!
Three! Two! One! Yeah!
Time!
She's alive!
Heroes win.
Speed, Lash, hit the showers.
Where's my boy?
- Will!
- Will!
- Yo, we're right here.
- Here.
l can't believe you won
Save the Citizen as a freshman.
That's never been done before.
You topped Mom's best score
in pinball? Get out of here.
- That's hilarious.
- There they are.
- Gwen?
- Hey.
Oh, Dad, this is Gwen Grayson.
Gwen Grayson, this is Dad.
Mr. Stronghold, it's such an honor.
l'm sorry to barge in like this.
Not at all. Will and l
were just hanging. Chilling.
Honey, Gwen is a Technopath,
and she's offered to help Will
with his science homework.
And she's a senior.
l know we said we were gonna work
on that antigravity stuff tomorrow,
but something came up.
- Can we can do it tonight?
- Sure. Yeah.
On one condition, Gwen.
You join us for dinner.
Oh, no, no, l couldn't intrude.
- Oh, yes, you can.
- You must.
OK. Well, thanks.
- So should we get started?
- Certainly.
Well, she's gorgeous.
And she fixed the disposal.
Really?
There we were,
in the middle of nowhere.
She's like, ''l can't change a tire.
l can only change the weather.''
l'm like, ''Can you at least
make it stop raining?''
l'll give him a few more minutes.
So, Gwen, do we know your parents?
l don't think so, Mrs. Stronghold.
Dad went inactive a few years ago.
Lets Mom do
all the work now, huh?
Mom passed away
when l was a baby.
So l did have an ulterior motive
in coming here tonight.
Will may have told you l'm the head
of the homecoming committee?
He most certainly did not.
Well, l was wondering
if you'd consider attending the dance.
- We would love to chaperone.
- Sure.
That's very nice,
Mrs. Stronghold, but no.
We were hoping that
you'd be the guests of honor
and receive the award
for Heroes of the Year.
Still working on that?
- Hey.
- Hey.
We go to school together.
- You're Stronghold's friend.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
You want me to heat that up for you?
You're not supposed to use
your powers outside of school.
l was just gonna
stick it in the microwave.
l was supposed to be
meeting Will here, but...
You want to sit down?
l think l can spare a minute.
Oh, look, hon.
What's his name?
Kid with the gravity.
- Lance, l think. Lance something.
- Yeah.
Oh, my gosh, look. There's Boomer.
- He had a mullet?
- Oh, God.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Remember her?
- She was a weird one.
- Oh, yeah. Sue Tenny.
Disappeared right before graduation.
Why is that?
No one ever really knew. Some say she
was recruiting villains at the school.
Others say she was
smoking in the girls' room.
Nightmare. All right. Speaking
of villains, there's one of the worst.
- Baron Battle.
- Warren's dad?
Always swore he'd have
his revenge on me.
And he totally stole
the lead in Oklahoma!
You have to stop caring about that.
- lt's a long time ago.
- Hon.
- l don't wanna talk about it.
- You deserved it. You did.
There was this time in first grade.
Know how you grow
lima beans in school?
Will couldn't figure out
why mine was growing quickly.
lt was driving him crazy.
So finally l took mercy on him,
and l told him about my powers,
and we've been best friends ever since.
And falling for him, was that
before or after the lima beans?
What? l am not in love
with Will Strong...
- ls it that obvious?
- Yeah.
Great.
- So, why don't you tell him?
- l was gonna ask him to homecoming,
but there's two problems.
He likes somebody else,
and she's perfect.
You know what l think?
To let true love remain unspoken
is the quickest route to a heavy heart.
Wow.
That is really deep.
Yeah.
And your lucky numbers are
four, 1 6, five and 49.
l got to go.
See you around, hippie.
You really didn't
have to walk me home.
l did if l wanted to spend
any time alone with you.
And, just so you know,
l don't usually hang out
all night with my mom and dad.
Your parents are great, Will.
l'm so glad they're
coming to homecoming.
Now, if l could only
find someone to go with.
You don't have
a date for homecoming?
Well, l've gotten a few offers,
but l turned them down.
l'm just waiting for the right guy.
You, Will.
Me?
Oh, hi, Daddy.
Bye, Will.
Bye.
You're not that boy
with the six arms, are you?
No, sir. Just two.
- Well, keep them to yourself.
- Yes, sir.
Good night, sir.
Yes!
Oh, man. OK. Here you go.
Homecoming. The greatest collection
of superteens ever gathered
to dance under one roof,
and then we shall have our revenge.
There's only one thing we're missing.
King Kamehamayhem's surfboard?
Darn this joystick!
Right, right. The Pacifier.
Hey, smooth move on the joystick.
Uncle. Uncle. Uncle.
Layla. You're not gonna believe
what happened to me last night.
Oh, love these.
''Your loyalties are clear
when it comes to friends.''
Oh, God.
Oh, l totally spaced.
l'm sorry. l know
you must want to kill me.
Actually, just the opposite.
l have something to tell you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, but you first.
OK. OK. lt's about homecoming.
Really? Me too.
l'm going with Gwen Grayson.
Can you believe it?
Me, a freshman, going
with the most amazing girl at Sky High.
- That's awesome.
- l know.
Morning.
Oh, yeah, l almost forgot.
What's your homecoming news?
l'm going too.
Really. Who with?
Who with?
Yeah, who asked you?
Oh, who asked me.
Warren Peace.
Warren Peace?
You can't be serious.
Layla, the guy's a psycho.
And he's my biggest enemy.
How could you go with him?
- When did you even start hanging out?
- Last night, 8:00, the Paper Lantern.
Hi, Warren.
Did l do or say anything last night
to make you think this is OK?
You're funny.
You'll never believe what happened.
l was about to ask Will
to homecoming when
l told him l was
going with you instead.
l don't remember
that being the plan.
- Hey. You did the history homework?
- What are you doing?
- lt's called sitting.
- No one sits here but me.
What'd you get for four?
Tigerman was,
A, bitten by a radioactive tiger,
or, B, bitten by a regular tiger
and then exposed to radiation.
Hey. Are we eating
at Warren's table now?
- l feel extremely dangerous.
- Whoa. Whoa.
- ls he bothering you, Magenta?
- Try the other way around.
Does anyone else need
a date for homecoming?
Warren, you are crazy.
l promise, l'll make this
as painless as possible.
So you're not doing this
just because you like me or anything.
- You're doing it to get to Stronghold.
- Yeah.
Then l'm in.
But l'm not renting a tux.
Hey, if Warren's not here,
is this still the tough-guy table?
Yeah, homecoming's stupid.
- So l think l'll go.
- Me too.
- What's up, guys?
- What up, dude?
What's going on?
- Nothing.
- Let's go, Stronghold.
Two days till
your Mad Science midterm,
and l am not gonna rest until you
can build a ray gun blindfolded.
Hey, cutie.
l was just thinking about you.
l cannot wait until homecoming.
l'm so excited. l finally...
Never call me cutie.
And is this the trigger?
No, that's the fusion device.
OK. ls...? What's this?
That's my phone.
Well, super-strong and psychic.
Hello?
Penny, l can't understand you
when you're all talking
at once. OK, better.
What? Oh, no.
- OK, hold on. Let me call you back.
- Hurry!
- What's up?
- Problem with homecoming decorations.
Penny forgot to order the fog machine,
so l might have to build one myself.
Think the committee could stop by?
Oh, l don't know because...
my parents are on a distress call,
and they won't be home
till late, and l'm not
- supposed to have anyone here.
- lt's cool.
l was just hoping we could
spend a little more time together,
but l guess l'll just see you at school?
Good night, Will.
l... lf it's...
lf it's only a few people.
Super.
Brian. You're getting
cheese all over the walls.
Larry, do you have to be
a two-ton rock right now?
Please, just power down.
Guys, guys, guys, guys. Guys, the floor.
Gwen, you said this was supposed
to be homecoming committee.
This is the homecoming committee.
OK, OK, so a few
extra people showed up.
But Will, you're popular.
That's what happens.
Every kid in Hero class is here.
How am l gonna get this
place cleaned in time?
Here. Come with me.
OK. So, what's on your mind?
- My friends.
- What about them? They're all here.
Oh, you mean the sidekicks.
l think l'm just
gonna call Zach and Layla,
tell them to come
over here because...
Will? You are such a nice guy.
But, honestly,
do you think they'd have fun?
With this crowd? l mean, don't
you think they'd feel a little awkward?
- No. l think they'd be OK.
- Trust me.
They'd be miserable.
- Whoa!
- Hey!
Sorry. Just looking for a bucket.
l wish there was somewhere
we could go to be alone.
Wow. This is incredible.
Yep. Well, when you
spend your whole life
kicking butt and taking names,
l guess you make a lot of memories.
Well, maybe we should
make a few of our own.
What's she doing here?
lsn't it past her bedtime?
Will? Could you go get me
a diet caffeine-free orange soda?
Anything for you.
- Who invited a sidekick?
- Yeah, what's she doing here?
Leaving.
Where's Will?
Honestly? Avoiding you.
Look. Will knows
you have a crush on him.
- He does?
- Everyone does.
Will's too nice to tell you he's not
interested. Not that you take a hint.
l mean, hello?
He's going to homecoming with me.
He threw a party
and didn't invite you.
You're just embarrassing him.
You're just embarrassing yourself.
OK. l understand.
And when you see Will again,
can you tell him that l never
want to talk to him again?
l'll give him the message.
Layla.
Layla. Layla. Layla.
Layla!
Have fun with Gwen.
You two deserve each other.
- Gwen.
- Oh, thanks, Will.
What did you say to Layla?
Nothing. l mean,
l just told her the truth.
You're a hero, she's a sidekick.
- She was holding you back.
- What?
Why would you do that? Layla's
been my best friend since first grade.
You've got new friends now,
and l think you need to figure out
whether you want to hang
with us or with those losers.
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, forget it.
l'm not going anywhere with you,
not now or not to homecoming.
Might as well just find
yourself a new date, Gwen.
You're dumping me?
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let's get something straight, OK?
You do not dump me!
Not the night before the dance.
Sorry, Gwen. l just did.
You're dumped.
You know, that's it. Everyone, out!
Party's over!
Don't stop on our account.
Your father and l fly
to Europe for two hours,
- and you throw a party?
- Unbelievable.
When l reach the count of three,
l want everyone out of this house!
Son, l'm only
going to ask you this...
Dad, l swear, l didn't plan this.
All right.
That's good enough for me.
Steve. l've got half a mind
not to let him go to homecoming.
That's fine.
l'm not going anyway.
Your mom said
she had ''half a mind.''
Will, you have to go
to the homecoming dance.
We all have to because we're introducing
the world to the Stronghold Three,
the greatest family of superheroes
mankind has ever known.
- Did something happen, Will?
- l don't want to talk about it.
Well, we're gonna talk
about it because...
...we promised Gwen
we'd go to the dance.
And when a Stronghold
makes a promise, son,
that promise is kept.
l promise you,
Dad, l'm not going.
Hello? Layla? Pick up, Layla.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.
Fine, don't pick up. lt's me.
l'm going to the Paper Lantern.
lf you get this message, meet me.
- You said that?
- True story.
- You said that?
- True story.
- You're so funny.
- l love life.
Thanks, Boom, for inviting me.
Layla. Layla, just pick up.
ln case you didn't get my earlier
messages, l'm at the Paper Lantern...
Message box full.
- What are you doing here?
- l'm looking for Layla.
- Do you know where she is?
- How should l know?
- You're taking her to homecoming.
- Oh, yeah. Right.
You don't have to worry
about me ruining your night.
- And why is that?
- Because l'm not going.
Well, that sucks.
Because we're only going
together to make you jealous.
Dude, you're so stupid.
- She's totally into you.
- Not after tonight.
l wouldn't be surprised
if Layla or any of the guys
- ever want to talk to me again.
- Yeah.
You must have been a real jerk.
Because no matter what l do,
l can't get them to stop talking to me.
Thanks.
- Hey, you want to dance?
- No.
Me neither.
Hey there, Layla.
You look like you could use a drink.
- No, thanks.
- Oh, don't worry.
The bubbles are just ginger ale.
The guys at this school are jerks.
Thanks a lot.
l thought you
weren't gonna rent a tux.
lt's my dad's. He doesn't
have much use for it in solitary.
Cheese cube?
We're taking off now, hon.
Still time to change your mind
and come with us.
No, l don't think so.
Mom, you ever feel like
you messed something up so bad
you'll never be able to fix it?
People make mistakes, Will.
That's what high school's about.
Heck, that's what life's about.
The key is to learn from them.
l hope my friends see it that way.
A true friend, you'd be surprised
at how understanding they can be.
Thanks.
Do me a favor?
Put this away for me.
Your father was trying
to sneak it under his cape.
He's convinced everyone
at homecoming wants to reminisce.
- l bet. Will do.
- Love you.
Have fun.
That's weird.
Gwen?
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.
l got to get to Sky High.
Josie, wait.
We can't unveil
the Stronghold Three without Will.
lt's just... lt's just not the same.
- Maybe we should fly home.
- We really don't need another award.
Welcome,
Commander and Jetstream.
Good evening.
First, a quick announcement.
The owner of the blue cold
fusion-powered jet pack,
you left your lights on.
Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.
And now, please help me welcome
the head of the homecoming committee,
the girl who made
all this possible, Gwen Grayson.
Thank you, Principal Powers.
And a very special thank you
goes to our guests of honor
and the recipients of our
first-ever Hero of the Year award,
the Commander and Jetstream.
To mark this occasion,
we planned a special tribute
to the most powerful super-being
ever to walk the halls of Sky High.
Me!
Commander?
Royal Pain is a girl?
Yes, l'm a girl, you idiot.
How l ever lost to a fool
like you l'll never know.
Now prepare to be pacified.
Do you honestly think
you can kill me with
that little toy gun of yours?
My dear Commander,
who said anything about killing you?
Josie! l've always...
Rock-a-bye, baby.
What'd l miss?
Boomer, get the kids out of here!
Hothead, find an exit.
Get as many people
out as you can.
l'll slow her down...
Thanks again for the lift, Ron.
Now, if l'm not back
in 30 minutes...
Come in after you. Got it.
l was gonna say go get help.
Go get help.
Got it. Now get in there.
Sorry.
Where the heck are we?
- Warren, how about a torch?
- lf you want to get barbecued.
Ladies, if l may.
Then all the reindeer loved him
- Way to glow, Zach.
- Thanks, man.
What's up, kid?
- You'll never believe this. Gwen...
- ls Royal Pain's daughter.
- And she...
- Stole the Pacifier.
- Right.
- And she turned everybody
into babies, including your parents.
OK. That l didn't know.
This is more than
the great Will Stronghold can handle.
She's right.
lt's gonna take all of us.
All of who? You and Warren?
The rest of us are only sidekicks.
Just because you have powers,
that doesn't make you a hero.
Sometimes it just makes you a jerk.
Makes me a jerk.
l guess what l'm trying to say is...
We get it. You've been a jerk.
Layla,
in case my homecoming date
ends up killing me tonight,
l just want you to know...
lsn't that sweet?
l hate sweet.
You guys are a part of this too?
- Why am l not surprised?
- Go take care of Gwen.
We'll handle these clowns.
Go.
''While pushing down
on the infant restraint,
pinch the two straps
together.'' Pinch.
- Royal, pinch.
- Pinch what? Restraint A or B?
Now you just calm down.
Let's go back to one.
Come back and fight. You...
Sidekick, aren't you
gonna fight back?
l don't believe in using
powers for violence.
l don't believe you
even have any powers.
Go, Penny. Beat Layla.
Go, Penny. Beat Layla.
You can't hide forever, sidekick.
No way.
Sucks for you.
l take you back,
my dear Commander,
to your senior year at Sky High,
a time before anyone
knew what a Technopath was.
So a brilliant but misunderstood
girl named Sue Tenny
was written off as a science geek
and stuck in Sidekick class.
She hatched a plan,
so daring, so visionary,
to start her very own
Supervillain Academy
and raise a generation of heroes
from scratch as villains.
But first she had to destroy
the very institution that dared
to spurn her genius!
And now, so many years later,
that plan is complete.
My only regret:
That this may be the finest
supervillain speech ever given,
and you don't even
know what l'm saying.
But l do.
Look. l'm sorry that my parents
destroyed your mom.
Now put my dad down.
No one could defeat Royal Pain.
When the Pacifier exploded,
l wasn't destroyed.
l was merely turned into a baby.
Stitches took me
and raised me as his daughter.
Daddy's little girl.
l told you never to call me that!
Lunatic.
That's right.
Royal Pain wasn't my mother.
Royal Pain is me.
Oh, my God.
l made out with an old lady.
Right here.
Way to go, Popsicle.
Big mistake.
- But l thought you were a sidekick.
- l am a sidekick.
Don't leave us here to die.
Royal Pain sabotaged
the antigravity device.
The whole school's
gonna fall out of the sky.
We only have ten minutes.
Here's the antigravity room.
- Didn't Royal Pain seal every route?
- What about this conduit?
Right. You'd have to
be like a rat to fit in there.
Oh, great.
This is so stupid.
OK. OK, you're doing great,
Magenta. Looks great.
Look at those cute little legs.
OK, go about ten feet.
Yeah, there should be
a opening on your right.
- Gotcha.
- Behind the access panel.
- What?
- lt leads to the generator.
l'm on it.
Will!
No!
And there goes
your last chance of stopping me.
We'll see about that.
Surprised?
- So am l.
- You're flying?
That's impossible!
There's only one person
authorized to transport superheroes.
That's Ron Wilson, bus driver.
And l'm Ron Wilson, bus driver.
l found the generator, l think.
She has to chew the wire
to the scrambler.
Cut the wire to the scrambler.
- The red one.
- What?
- Cut the red wire!
- There's a lot of red wires down here.
The school is falling.
Chew!
Chew the wire! Chew the wire!
All unpacked.
The movers didn't break a thing.
Told you we didn't need
that extra insurance.
No, l know.
lt's all on you! Hold me! Hold me!
That could have been messy.
Good night.
Chester? Chester?
- Now what?
- Beats me.
Perhaps l can be of assistance.
lt should only take me a couple
of hours to reconfigure the Pacifier.
Mr. Peace, would you please
carry me to the Mad Science Lab?
- Sure.
- And, Mr. Peace.
Yeah.
Regrettably, l have made boom-boom.
People, if you've
already been de-Pacified,
please find your clothes, grab a baby
and report to the Science Lab.
Mom? Dad? Guys?
l just want to say sorry because
this whole thing was my fault.
- You can't blame yourself.
- Of course not.
How were you to know
your girlfriend was a total psychopath?
No, that's not it.
You gave me one rule,
and l broke it.
l took her into the sanctum,
and that's how she got the Pacifier.
The whole party was a trap.
And so was the homecoming, Will.
We all fell into Royal Pain's trap,
but you defeated her.
You saved Sky High,
- and everyone in her.
- l didn't do it by myself.
Excuse me. Steve? Josie?
Though it appears Gwen
only came up with this award
as a way to lure you
to the dance and your ultimate doom,
still it's inscribed, so...
l'd be honored to accept
this ''Hero of the Year'' award.
But l'm afraid
this doesn't belong to us.
lt belongs to them.
The sidekicks.
l mean, hero support.
Why don't we just call them
what they really are, Josie?
Heroes.
Oh, and Jonathan?
Whatever you're teaching them,
keep teaching them it.
Sure.
What a waste.
l can't do anything more to help you.
l'm not Wonder Woman, you know.
l went through puberty twice for this?
l have de-Pacified all the babies
and destroyed
that horrible weapon forever.
Let's boogie.
This is so sweet, l could hurl.
Tell me about it.
- Do you wanna dance?
- Yes.
l mean, yeah. Yeah.
Compared to homecoming.
the rest of the year was pretty boring.
Gwen and her gang
got what they deserved.
Now nobody wants
to Save the Citizen.
- Uncle! Uncle!
- Relax. i'm kidding.
They do spend a lot of time together.
Oh. yeah.
and Ron Wilson. bus driver.
fell into a vat of toxic waste.
He now works for the mayor.
defending the city from giant robots.
So in the end. my girlfriend
became my archenemy.
my archenemy
became my best friend
and my best friend
became my girlfriend.
But. hey. that's high school.
