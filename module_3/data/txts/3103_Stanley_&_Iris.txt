My house, 7:30.
Good night, Iris.
See you.
Have a good weekend.
Hey, stop him!
He's got my purse!
Wait a minute!
Ow!
Oh!
Oh!
Give me my purse,
god damn it! Give it to me!
Give me my purse,
you little bastard!
Oh, god!
Oh, god!
Oh! Ow!
Hey!
You ok?
Oh, oh, lady!
Lady!
Lady! Lady, hold it,
I'm trying to help you.
Where'd he go?
Why don't you go after him?
He's in the next state by now.
We're not going to catch him.
He's got my paycheck...
my whole week's paycheck.
Are you ok?
My house keys were in there,
my wallet, my credit cards...
...my rosary, my kids' pictures.
That little bastard.
Wrong, lady.
That was a big bastard.
You're out of your head to
run after somebody like that.
Let him have the purse.
Let him have it. Give it to him.
Give it to him. I'd like to give
him a knee where he lives.
Jeez, he could have been high.
You're lucky.
- How come I don't feel lucky, mister?
- It's only money.
Yeah, but it's my money. When it's yours,
you can be a philosopher.
Whew!
Thank you.
You ok?
- Are you all right?
- It's ok.
I see you at work.
You work in the bakery?
I'm in the canteen.
Behind the mashed potatoes.
Nobody ever looks
at the cook.
Well, um...
Thanks.
You were really nice to stick your neck out
back there. You could have gotten hurt.
I didn't.
Well, it's lucky you
were on the bus.
I don't usually take the bus,
but they stole my bike.
Thanks.
Um, would you take some money,
and I don't know, have a beer on me?
Lady,
I don't want your money.
- Anyway, you don't have any.
- Yes, I do.
I keep a 5-dollar bill rolled
up in my shoe. Here.
No, no.
Keep it for the next time.
There's not going
to be a next time.
I believe you.
I'm Stanley Cox.
Iris King.
Stay out of harm's way,
Mrs. King.
- I'll try, Mr. Cox.
- Good.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- What did the doctor say?
- They're going to do a scrape.
- When?
- A couple of weeks.
- You going to have to stay over?
- Nope. In and out.
What's the matter with you?
I'm not going to discuss my plumbing
with everyone at this table.
There must have been 500 guys
at the employment office today.
I saw everybody I know.
This one guy brought a broom and
swept off the sidewalk out front,
just for something to do.
Can you believe that?
Too bad it wasn't you.
- Did they have anything?
- An opening for a hairdresser.
I didn't do much better.
I can't run a computer, and I can't give
a pedicure, and that's all there was,
so, we won't be paying you
anything this week or next.
I didn't ask.
No, but you're making us count
every roll of toilet paper.
You're making us use the
soap down to the last sliver.
You know, I wouldn't be here
if I didn't have to be.
I'd be in my own house,
with my own Drexel furniture
and air conditioning.
We're all in the same
lifeboat, Sharon.
Don't rock it.
Where did you get
the money for beer?
Huh?
I'm asking you!
Where did you get
the money for beer?
You stole my money!
All right, I've been
holding out on you.
I've been saving up
to get my teeth fixed.
I'm not getting my face
lifted to go to Hollywood.
And he stole it!
You had my paycheck
when I had one.
I needed a drink.
You took the money for
my teeth, you bastard!
I'm not a piece of garbage
you can smell a block away.
I'm a man.
You bastard!
You bastard! You...
Out.
Out, kids.
Walk around the block.
Well, that's a first
for this house.
Oh...
How long do you think we'll
have to stay out here?
I don't know.
Until they cool off, I guess.
I cleaned up the kitchen.
I cleaned up my sister.
You should have
called the cops on me.
I couldn't have
made your bail.
We fight a hell of a lot,
Sharon and me.
It started at city hall
and never quit.
Why'd you marry her?
She was cute.
None of us stay cute.
You and George had
a hell of a marriage.
He wasn't even
a good-looking guy.
Yes, he was.
He didn't make a big living.
He made enough.
But the guy was dying.
You slept on the
floor by his bed.
You washed him.
You cleaned up his mess.
You held him up
on the toilet.
Maybe I married
the wrong sister.
Go to bed, Joe.
I bought a bunch of
condoms yesterday.
From now on, nobody is
getting in without one.
Yeah, well, you got
rush-hour traffic.
I haven't got anybody
to give one to.
I can fix you up
with somebody,
but he's a little older.
How old?
He fought in World War II.
Too old. Give me
Korea, give me Vietnam.
How about The National Guard?
I just want to get pregnant
and get out of here.
You'll be back.
It takes 2 incomes.
Where's your husband, Bertha?
Doing time, just like me.
Are they ready?
Uh...
Yeah.
I stretched them
as far as they'd go.
Try them on.
Oh, they're still too tight.
Cheap shoes.
Actually, maybe they
are a little better.
Oh, hi.
Hello.
Goodness.
Hello.
Hi.
Brown brogues.
Got a ticket?
You didn't give me a ticket.
Nah, you got a ticket.
We don't take shoes
without giving tickets.
You didn't give me one.
No, everybody gets a ticket.
I didn't.
You lost it.
No, I didn't get a ticket.
Everybody gets a ticket.
I didn't get a ticket.
You said it cost $2.00.
Here's the $2.00.
I didn't get a ticket.
Everybody gets a ticket.
Mister, I'm going to describe
the shoes to you, ok?
And then you can give them to me.
They're brown brogues.
They're right over there,
right behind you.
Well, if you don't
got a ticket,
you got to sign for them.
Just give me the shoes.
Put your name down.
Just give me the shoes.
Write your name down.
Don't wrap them.
Just hand them to me.
Put your signature down...
that guy's crazy.
He wanted his shoes,
and he paid for them.
Hey, we've been waiting
15 minutes!
Do you believe that?
Might as well walk.
You can't even get a bus!
What kind of service is this?
I've been on my feet all day.
Bus out again?
Yeah.
Third time this week.
Want a ride home?
Well, guess it beats
waiting around
for another 30 minutes.
Ok.
Have fun.
Hey, honey, you got
room for one more?
I see you got
your bike back.
No, I had to buy another
one secondhand.
You don't drive a car?
I like a bike better...
cleaner, cheaper.
I'd take a new green chevy
if I could make the payments.
This town's getting too big.
I'd like to move to the country,
away from people.
Get some 'Rhode Island Reds',
some cows for milk,
maybe put a hex sign
up on my barn.
How about some barbed wire?
Oh, a mean dog would do.
Have you always been a cook?
I'm a good cook.
I like to cook.
Oh, listen, excuse me,
but the food in the
canteen is lousy.
The boss is cheap.
He won't buy good stuff.
You got to buy good
stuff for good food.
With me, it's got to come out of
a box or a can, whatever's fast.
That's my house.
Hi, Stanley!
Hi!
And that's my father.
You still live at home
with your father?
I wasn't born until he was 50.
He likes to have me around.
Does he get along
with your wife?
I don't have one.
You live at home
with your father,
you do your own cooking,
and you're not married.
Is that the whole story?
I think that's about as much
as I'm going to talk about.
All right.
What do you do with
yourself after work?
I go to the movies.
Alone?
I take a bag of popcorn.
You don't mix much, do you?
No.
You got something
that's catching?
I think I'm about
out of small talk.
I didn't stick my
thumb out, Mr. Cox.
You offered to give me a ride.
This is it, right here.
Thanks for the lift.
Yes, ma'am.
A guy broke into the house
across the street
and bashed an old lady
over the head.
It wasn't you, was it?
You don't have to be
scared of me, lady.
I don't even kill mosquitoes.
I'm home.
Chicken and peas
and potatoes, please.
Thanks.
I'll have the same.
Chicken...
Peas...
And potatoes.
Chicken.
Peas.
- Peas.
- Peas.
Bobby, you want to
check the fruit for me?
I'm on top of it!
Uh, that shirt's going to run.
You ought to separate
the whites from the color.
I wash everything together...
Including my socks.
One load is four quarters.
You put in a pretty long day.
Oh, I don't mind.
Gets me out of the house.
Just sit here
and watch the wash
go round and round.
Read my magazine.
There's a chinese
take-out next door.
Can I buy you an egg roll?
You sure can.
How long since
he passed away?
My husband?
Mm-hmm.
Forever.
8 months.
How are you getting along?
It's a heavy load.
Sometimes my knees bend.
Did he leave you insurance?
They canceled.
So money's tight.
Well, I'm not going to take
any vacations in
Bermuda this year.
If I'm lucky,
I'll get a day in Boston.
Oh, I'd love to go to
Boston for a day,
stay in a hotel and
have room service.
You know,
where they charge you
$2.50 for a cup of coffee
and bring it to you
in a little silver pot
and put a chocolate
on your pillow
and turn your bed
down for you.
I went to the
Grand Canyon once.
I walked all the way
down to the bottom.
Stayed there 6 days
and 6 nights.
Slept in a bedroll.
Didn't see anybody.
Didn't say anything
to anybody.
The best time I ever had.
6 days?
Oh, god, it would
drive me crazy.
You don't have to
fight for anything.
You don't have to
explain anything.
You don't have to
dodge anything.
You just feed the whitetail deer,
and you watch the sun go down.
You see, I like bright lights,
and a lot of people.
I see you're feeling
pretty good today.
You're wearing
your pink sweater.
That's what you wear
when you feel good.
When you feel bad,
you wear the gray one.
I only have 2 sweaters.
Am I right or wrong?
You're watching me.
You stand out.
Let's take a look at
these fortune cookies.
"Make new friends
and trust them. "
Did you write this?
No, but it seems like
pretty good advice.
Ha!
What did you get?
Here.
Open it.
No, no point in opening mine.
I'm not lucky.
Oh.
I better go pick up my wash.
Ok.
We need a refill
on shrink wrap!
You were 15 minutes
in the toilet.
You get a 5-minute
break on this line.
I had cramps.
Have them in 5 minutes.
That's your limit.
And you, get your hair
up inside your net!
Fuck this factory and fuck him.
Oh, looks like we got
ourselves a new flavor.
Back to the salt
bagel mines.
Oh, god, the smell of
chocolate chip cookies
is giving me a headache.
We need a longer break.
You got a tylenol?
No.
Yeah, yeah,
look under the counter,
right in front of you.
Got a bunch of
stuff in there.
That's rolaids.
That's sine-aid.
Never mind.
Hey, Cox, somebody's ass
is going in the meat grinder.
And don't tell me you're
going to call your Union,
because I'm going
to call the cops.
$2,000 worth of
purchase orders
for this kitchen
never got here.
What, do you think I'm upstairs
chewing on a dead cigar?
I got a bookkeeper, and
maybe she's got bad breath,
but she's got good eyes.
What happened to
my mayonnaise?
What happened to my
150 pounds of coffee?
What happened
to my tuna fish?
Come on,
who's getting fat off of me?
It isn't Stanley Cox.
Who are you?
What do you know?
You know something
I don't know?
He can't read,
and he can't write,
so it isn't him.
Do you mind if I sit down?
I don't feel much
like company.
I gave you away, didn't I?
Yes, ma'am, you did.
You were headed for trouble.
Lady, I'm always in trouble.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Is that right?
You don't rob banks.
I can't open an account in one.
What do you do
with your money?
Keep it under my mattress
like a skid-row bum.
I never thought
what it would be like.
You're in a city. You can't
read the street signs.
You're lost.
You grab people.
You stop them.
You ask 3 people.
You ask 4 people.
"Which way?
Where do I go?
How do I get there?"
You can't take a bus.
You can't read
where it's going.
You can't drive a car
because you can't
get a license.
You ask yourself,
"have I got a name
if I can't write it?
Am I a human being
if I can't read it?"
Why don't you do
something about it?
Hey, Cox, could you
shut off the water?
I want to talk to
you for a minute.
I got some bad news for you.
This is your last day.
Could you pick up
your paycheck?
You had some complaints?
No, as a matter of fact,
you make a pretty good stew.
So, what's the beef?
Hey, listen,
you can't read, you know?
You could pick up
the wrong box.
Try to pick up a box of salt
and get a box of roach
powder or something.
Hey, you're dangerous.
I could have a lot of sick
people around here.
I could have a lot of
lawsuits around here.
Hey, you know,
you're a good man.
You show up on time
for work and everything,
but everybody sues
nowadays, you know?
All right, swab the toilets.
Make sure you do
the seats, too,
and around the base.
Sometimes they miss.
Any writing on
the walls... off.
There's more telephone
numbers in there
than the city directory.
Hey, you sure
you want this job?
Yeah.
Ok.
Apple pickers.
You, you, you, and you.
That's all.
Let's go.
Let's go.
You're not, uh,
currently employed, then?
No.
The social worker says
you don't have a place
of residence anymore?
I'm living in a garage.
We can't have your
father there, can we?
Ok, uh, just a few questions.
Can he manage
the toilet all right?
Yes.
Is he taking any medication?
No.
Well, that's remarkable,
for a man his age.
Any problem with his memory?
It's clean.
He's smart, and he's broke.
There'll be 4 in his room.
We'll try to get him
a window bed.
Dinner's at 5:00.
He can have an evening
snack if he wants it,
and we do have
a television room.
I'll be all right here.
Good.
Good.
Let me see the view.
That's nice.
Ha!
Look, they have
a birdbath out there.
Oh, yeah.
If I get a good job, dad,
you'll be out the next day.
Looks like a good bed.
I don't want you
laying around in it.
I want you to stay up,
go for a walk,
find somebody
to play cards with.
I'll find somebody.
If you need an extra blanket,
you tell them, ok?
I am not afraid to
open my mouth.
If you don't like the food,
you tell me.
I'll bring you something.
All right.
A deli sandwich, some fruit.
All right.
And I'll come every sunday.
I'll be glad to see you.
Ahem.
Uh...
Yeah.
You've been a
good father, pop.
I'm sorry.
Don't kill me off.
I'm still a good father.
You never laid
a hand on me.
I'm going to now.
Eh...
The doctor says
you're pregnant.
Well, are you?
If he says so, I guess I am.
This is all news to you?
How was I supposed to know?
I'm always missing.
You had to let me
show up here
and get slapped
in the face with it.
I didn't know.
Who is it?
I'm not telling you.
You always treat me
like a little kid.
You know, do this, do that.
And I'm not
a little kid anymore.
This is all to get at me?
Maybe.
You're 5 months pregnant
because I made you
clean your closets
and get in by 10:00?
Maybe.
Who is it?
I'll see you in hell first.
What do you think
you're doing?
She's my mother.
You two want to take this
home and settle it there?
How is she?
I don't know.
We're not talking.
You're responsible for a baby.
You know that.
You got to plan for it,
want it, take care of it,
feed it, raise it,
get it through diaper rash,
get it through measles.
It's not just a jolt of semen.
It's a human being.
It needs clothes,
it needs shots,
it needs to go to school.
And I'll tell you
something else.
Look at me.
I'm not going to look after it.
I've got to keep my job
and take care of
my own family,
and you got to take
care of yours.
I'll manage.
You'll manage?
You're still sleeping
with your teddy bear.
I'll stay with a friend
if you don't want me.
A girl's best friend
is her mama.
At least that's what it says
on the greeting cards.
Thanks.
It's sweet, isn't it?
Good.
Mr. Cox, I'm sorry.
We tried to call you
a number of times.
We sent a telegram.
He went peacefully
in the night.
The truth is,
when they come
into a place like this,
they tend to go
downhill pretty fast.
Well, you'll want these.
There are a few things
for the death certificate.
Leonides Cox.
It's Leonides?
That's an unusual name.
How do you spell it?
Mr. Cox.
I don't know.
Oh, god.
Mrs. King!
Hello.
Haven't seen you around.
I'm working in the
car wash now.
How's it going?
It's just work.
Can I ask you something?
Sure, yeah, go ahead.
You don't have an umbrella.
No, no, I'm ok.
What is it?
Uh, I've been thinking...
Yeah?
And, uh, do you have
any spare time?
Not much,
but what's on your mind?
I thought maybe...
I'll talk to you
some other time.
Hey, you've come out now.
Let it go, let it go.
Ok. I have to, because
I'm going to miss my bus.
What is it?
Come on, what is it?
I wanted to ask you if, uh,
if you could do something.
I shouldn't have started this.
I'll be around.
Oh, wait!
Teach me to read.
What does that say?
"Man builds no structure
which outlives a book. "
I'm making too late a start.
You're making a start, Mr. Cox.
Excuse me.
Do you have...
It's a questionnaire.
It's supposed to break
the ice between us,
help us to get to
know each other.
Let's get it over with.
Student name?
Stanley Everett Cox.
Everett?
My grandmother's brother.
"Interviewed by... "
That's me, Iris King.
Ok, number one.
"Name something you enjoy doing. "
What are they getting at?
They want to find
out about you.
I don't see the point.
They just want to know
the kind of things
you like to do...
you know...
Hunting, fishing,
stuff like that.
This is not going
in an FBI file.
I make contraptions.
I invent them.
Why do you enjoy
doing that?
I'm good at it.
Did you ever go to school?
50 schools.
One for every
state of the Union.
"Where were you born?"
Hillside, New Jersey.
"Name 3 things you
wish you could read. "
I don't know.
I wouldn't know what to pick.
Well, I suppose
the daily newspaper.
I'd like to read a
baseball scoreboard.
I like the game.
"Name something you
wish you could write. "
That's easy.
A big check.
"Finish this sentence.
<i>I hope that... "</i>
I hope I don't make
a damn fool of myself.
"Finish this question.
<i>I wonder if... "</i>
I wonder if I'm smart enough.
"Finish this sentence.
<i>I'm good at... "</i>
I'm good at getting
the right teacher.
It's a seiko!
Thanks, mom.
That's for making your bed and
graduating grammar school...
and putting the toilet
seat down for us ladies.
All right, mine's next.
Hey.
Most of the time, that is.
You look just like
your old man.
You walk like him.
You act like him.
He's a hard act
to follow, Richard.
You're going to do him proud.
Honey.
Honey.
Oh, I've got to quit this.
Oh, listen, go ahead,
have a good cry.
Why do they call
it a good cry?
All it does is make
you look like hell.
And what's missing
is still missing.
Now, listen,
you've got your kids.
You've got your family.
I got a lot of days
and nights ahead of me.
You like to garden.
You like to cook.
I like to make love
is what I like.
3 times a week
like clockwork.
Sunday morning
with the door locked,
sent the kids to McDonald's,
ate lunch in bed afterwards,
whatever was in
the refrigerator...
pot roast, potato salad.
Well, listen, maybe you'll
meet somebody else.
I don't want to
meet anybody else.
I want my old man back...
in his baggy pants,
looking at me over
the top of his bifocals.
You can't hold on forever.
Why not?
Because I want you
to be happy again.
You know something, Sharon?
I'm sorry sometimes
that I stole your
add-a-pearl necklace.
Oh, you are, are you?
I haven't thought
about that in 22 years,
but I'll never forgive you.
Good evening, Mrs. King.
Um...
Um...
I'm a little drunk.
No kidding.
Come on in.
There seems to be something
in the way here.
Just your feet.
Oops-a-daisy, Mr. Cox.
I needed a little
courage tonight.
Think you can make
it to the bathroom?
Where is it?
One flight up.
And I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't throw
up on my carpet.
Um...
I may be drunk, Mrs. King,
but I'm housebroken.
Ok?
It's right up there.
How do you feel now?
Foolish.
You're getting
my floor all wet.
I'll mop it up.
I'm going to go down
and make a lot of coffee.
Well, sit down.
You want a cookie?
I made them myself.
No, thanks.
Well, why don't we
just wade in?
No.
I want to know how
this happened to you.
Did you drop out of school?
Were you smoking
dope or what?
Where was your family?
Where were your teachers?
Well...
My father was
a tableware salesman...
silver plate stuff,
not real sterling.
He went all over the country,
and I went with him.
Lived in motels,
went to a different
school every month.
Most of the time
I didn't even know
what state of the
Union I was in.
Oh, I'd stay up late
looking at old westerns
with John Wayne
or playing 2-handed
poker with my father or...
listening to people fighting
in the next room.
And in the morning,
I'd eat a cold doughnut
and find a seat in the last
row of the classroom
and slide down on my
tail bone and just sleep.
Somebody would say,
"Hey, you!"
I'd open up an eye,
and they'd say,
"Where's the mouth
of the Mississippi?"
And I'd scratch my head,
and they'd say, "Next!"
And I'd go back to sleep.
And when I woke up,
I'd be in a different school.
That's how it went.
It just all went by me.
I've been...
A big dummy ever since.
This is a bird with a long
tail and a round body.
- Say "bird".
- Bird.
This looks like a bird with a
long tail and a round body.
Say "bird".
Bird.
This is the word "bird. "
Read "bird. "
"Bird. "
Bird starts with
the sound "buh. "
Say "buh. "
- Buh.
- Again.
Buh.
- Again.
- Buh.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
And this letter.
Fuh.
This letter.
Guh.
Ok, word.
Don't make it too
tough on me, now.
What's this word?
"Hand. "
What's this word?
"Hand. "
This sentence tells what
the girl has in her hand.
Read it.
"The girl has a... "
"Fish in her hand. "
Good.
It's not exactly a cliffhanger.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Phil.
Kelly, get off the line.
It's for me.
Fine, and yourself?
Good.
I... nothing much.
I'm just slogging along.
Well, nobody's been seeing
much of me, Phil.
I don't think I'm ready
to go dancing, Phil.
Ok.
Yeah.
Thanks for calling.
What's this word?
How long since you
been out with a man?
The last time was to take
one to the hospital.
What's this word?
"Bird. "
This is a yellow birch.
<i>Latin name,
Betula lutea.</i>
Its leaves taste like mint.
Taste it.
Mmm.
This is a basswood.
<i>Latin name,
Tilia cordata.</i>
It's a nice shade tree.
What do you think?
Do you want it?
This is a Norway maple.
<i>Latin name,
Acer platinoides.</i>
Turns red in the fall.
Very, very pretty.
Red?
You know, the red
leaves in the fall.
Very, very pretty.
How did you find out
about all that?
I asked.
I took the leaves to
a Japanese nursery,
said I liked trees.
They said,
"We like trees, too. "
So we sat on
a manure sack
and talked about it
for a couple of hours.
This is a red oak.
<i>Latin name,
Quercus rubra.</i>
It'll outlive us both.
- That one?
- Mm-hmm.
How old do you
think it is now?
I'd say it's about
300 years old.
Let's go sit
down over here.
Mmm.
I lost my dad, too,
not too long ago.
My dad was sick
for a long time.
The thing of it is,
see, I, uh...
I had to put him in a home.
I couldn't read,
so I couldn't hold down a job.
I couldn't take care of him.
If I'd been able to read,
he might still be alive.
I'm...
I'm afraid of the dark.
When my dad let me,
I'd leave the light
on all night.
My dad was the light.
We have to leave it on
about another 15 minutes.
I don't know what
I'm doing this for.
So you'll look pretty.
Nothing in a bottle's
going to do that.
You know, you're not
so bad looking
if you'd use a little
more eye make-up.
This is as far as I go.
I wish this baby
was born already.
It will be.
I don't want it.
I didn't want you, either.
You were an accident.
Your daddy and me
were cleaning the car.
Remember the
old blue Pontiac?
And he squirted me,
and I took my
shirt off, and...
We got playful.
We didn't even
make it up the stairs.
But when they
brought you in to me,
I almost said,
"Take it away. It's not mine. "
That's how I felt about you.
You'd nuzzle me,
and I'd stare at you.
How was I going to take you
home and take care of you?
I didn't feel anything for you.
And then one day I was
changing your diapers,
and I found blood
on the cloth,
and I knew in my heart
that you had
a terrible disease,
that I was...
that I was being punished.
And I showed it
to the nurse,
and she said,
"Oh, it's nothing.
It's just all your hormones
getting across to her. "
And I said, "You mean it's
nothing to worry about?"
And she said,
"No. It's nothing. "
And I held you in my arms,
and at that very minute,
you belonged to me.
My daughter.
Am I your daughter?
Yes.
"Don says... "
Dan.
Dan.
Dan.
<i>"Dan says,
thank you for the... "</i>
- Dish.
- Dish.
Uh-huh.
Go on.
"Ed. "
"Ed.
<i>Ed says,
thank you for the</i>
fffffffff... "
Fish.
Fish.
Fish.
Put it together.
<i>"Ed says, thank you
for the fish. "</i>
Go on.
"Fff... Fred... "
Fran.
<i>"Fran says, thank you</i>
<i>for the eee... "</i>
You didn't do your
homework, did you?
No.
I watched the
welterweight fights.
Terrific.
Either you're serious,
or you're not.
I'm a fight fan.
You're gonna have
one with me
because I don't like
to waste my time.
I'll just come back
when you cool off.
It may be a while.
I'm in a bad mood.
Maybe you ate something
that didn't agree with you.
My whole life doesn't
agree with me.
I'm gaining weight.
I yell at my kids.
I need a sex life.
I've been wanting to
go to bed with you
ever since I first saw you.
"A," I don't know why...
And "B," forget it.
Take a wild guess.
You know?
No.
It's going to happen.
Listen, you,
I don't just hop in bed
with strangers.
I ask a lot of questions.
I do a lot of talking.
I got to know about a guy.
Ask.
I don't even know
if you're healthy.
I'll get a blood test.
I'd want one.
Excuse me.
You're tough.
Well, this has not
been a perfect day.
I got a back-tax bill.
I ran into a girl I went
to high school with.
She said she wouldn't
have recognized me.
That was food for thought.
Also my feet hurt.
Sit down.
I'll iron.
You'll iron.
I do it all the time.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Ahh.
<i>"Fran says,
thank you for the... "</i>
"Egg!"
God damn it.
Egg.
- Right.
- Egg.
Don't scorch the shirts.
Coming right up.
Guh.
"G. Girl. "
Ok, down.
All the way down
below the guideline.
Up and around
and then down.
That's right.
That's right.
That's good. You don't
ever pick your pencil up
when you're doing Ps.
Down.
Up.
Yeah. Keep your pencil
on the paper.
Up and around.
Ok. You're here
at 'Ash and Tyler'.
Meet me at Washington
and Post Road.
Give me 15 minutes.
Find me.
Can you tell me
how to get to...
Where do you want to go?
Forget it.
Thanks, anyway.
Where's Washington and Post?
Oh.
You're not even close.
- You got to go down
to Morrison. - Yeah.
- Then left to grand.
- Uh-huh.
Then right to Comstock.
Are there any tall
buildings or bridges,
churches, anything?
You'll see the street signs.
All right.
Thanks.
Where the hell
have you been?
I said 15 minutes.
I thought you'd been
hit by a car.
Are you listening to me?
I haven't seen you.
No.
Am I going to see you?
No.
Can I come in?
Well, you're
a hard man to find.
I moved.
I only got one seat.
So I see.
No dishes in the sink.
I eat mostly take-out.
Where are you working now?
Same place.
Maybe it was... it was me.
You know, maybe I blew it.
They've got a program
over at the high school.
Maybe you could try that.
It came too hard.
I'm not a kid anymore.
So, that's it?
That's it.
God, I hate to bomb out.
It took me 2 years
to toilet train Richard,
but he finally went
to the bathroom.
That's not my problem.
What is this?
It's what I do from midnight
till 4:00 in the morning,
sometimes till 5:00 or 6:00.
What does it do?
Cools cakes fast.
Does a good job.
Stanley.
Maybe you should
show this to somebody.
I already have.
A couple of guys from
the tool and die plant
came nosing around.
They offered me a job.
How can you make something
like this when you can't read?
When you put a man in jail
or you put him in solitary,
sometimes he'll
draw pictures
on the wall with a spoon,
sometimes he'll
train cockroaches.
This is what I made
in my prison.
You sure kept it quiet.
Hmm.
Everybody around here just
gets up and goes to work
and eats and sleeps
and gets up the next day
and just works and
eats and sleeps.
God, I'd like to see
somebody go past that.
Hello, Richard.
Mr. Cox.
Is your mother home?
Yeah.
She's in the kitchen.
What have you been up to?
Oh, reading.
Reading?
What are you reading?
Comics.
Who are you
talking to, Richard?
It's me.
Come on out in the kitchen.
Well, it's still your seat.
Your hair looks different.
Yeah.
I liked it better
the other way.
It's too late now.
You been keeping up?
Trying to.
You had your dinner?
I ate.
You want to get at it?
That's what I'm here for.
Let's see.
We can review.
Those are new.
You begin to admit
you need things...
One at a time.
Page 13.
"This is... "
"A river. "
"This is... "
"A... Sss... Snake. "
Mm-hmm.
"This is... "
"A... Tent. "
Good.
"This is... "
"Woman. "
What are you doing here?
I thought I'd sit with
you if you want me to.
I was feeling pretty much
on my own tonight.
How's she doing?
It's going to be any minute.
She almost had it
on the way here.
How do you feel about
being a grandmother?
Calm.
You don't look like
a grandmother.
That's why I'm calm.
It was nice of you to come.
Not much of a favor.
You know what I think?
What?
I think you and me are
getting to be friends.
We are.
Do you want me
to call her Iris?
No.
I never liked my name.
How about your
middle name?
Estelle?
Oh, god, that's worse.
Well, I want it to be
one or the other.
She's going to hate it.
Well.
Well, good evening.
Hello.
Iris.
Go wash your hands
and sit down. I cooked.
White or dark?
I'll have a leg
and a piece of white.
White or dark?
Either.
Hi.
Hi.
White or dark?
Um, leg.
Leg.
Here you go.
Take that.
Hi.
This is good.
No, no.
It's not a capital "I. "
Remember.
A lower-case "I"
just is straight down
to the bottom guideline,
with no...
not that cross line.
Ok.
Next letter.
Uh... "D. "
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Circle around
at the midguideline to
the bottom guideline,
and straight up...
And down.
Oop!
That's ok.
It's looking better.
That's right.
And "R. "
That jacket.
Something wrong with it?
It's had it.
It's coming out at the elbows.
It's old.
It's too old.
Come upstairs.
What's upstairs?
I don't know what
I'm keeping these for.
They're just
going to get moths.
Try this on.
Come on.
That's pretty good.
Iris, I'm glad
to have the clothes,
but I want to tell you
something.
There's a different
man in them.
Not so very.
Are we going to walk
around each other?
Is that what we're
going to do, Iris?
Is that what
2 grown-up people do?
It's what one nervous
woman does.
I'll tell you what.
I'm going to spend some
time and money on you
and see if we can't put
a match to this fire.
Don't go crazy.
You're not a rich man.
I feel like one.
Look like one.
Isn't that...
I don't like this.
I quit school.
I couldn't stand it.
Don't you know this line
doesn't go anywhere?
Three people in bed are
one too many for me.
Mom!
- Mom!
- What's the matter?
There's a man outside,
and he's walking
back and forth
looking at our house.
He's been there
for 20 minutes.
Hey!
What are you
doing out there?
Oh, god.
You scared us to death.
What are you doing walking
back and forth out here?
I'm thinking.
Well, can you think inside?
Can you come in
and sit down
and have a cup of coffee?
Can you come out
of the cold? Come on.
Would you please
come inside?
Have a cup of coffee.
It's ok, kids.
Hello, Richard.
Hello, Mr. Cox.
Kelly.
How's the baby?
I'd like a little privacy around
here if I can get any.
Take Estelle upstairs.
Homework.
Oh, my god.
- How have you been?
- How have you been?
- I've had colitis.
- Hmm.
- You ok now?
- Yeah. I'm better.
You're not supposed
to drink coffee.
I do, anyway.
Then it's going to come back.
It has.
You're smart,
but you're not sensible.
God knows that's true.
No.
You're not sensible,
or I'd have
heard from you.
I want to tell
you something.
Go ahead.
I haven't been to the
cemetery in 3 weeks.
I'm not going anymore.
Why does it have to be
all or nothing with you?
If you want to go,
that's fine.
Just don't bury yourself there.
Burn your gray sweater.
It cost $30.
I'll buy you 5 more,
all different colors, like a rainbow.
Red.
I like red.
- Red, blue, green, pink...
- Stop.
No. I don't want to stop.
I want to go on.
I carried a bunch of quarters
around in my pocket...
in case I got up the nerve
to call you at work.
You didn't use them.
No.
I wrote you a letter, too.
It's been sitting around
for about 3 weeks.
It's got gravy on it.
It's got ketchup on it.
It's got the baby's
bananas on it.
Here.
"Dear Stanley.
"Give... me... a...
"second chance.
"I've got a whole
lot saved up.
"You won't be sorry.
"Let's try again.
Iris. "
"And the lid, lead,
"lead storage battery
"is the chief unit of an
"automobile ignition system.
"It consists of
2 or more cells
"connected...
connected to each other
in a hard r...
rubber case. "
Yeah.
"A strawberry bed
"should have a large amount
- of fertil... fertilizer... "
- Quiet.
"And organic matters
"such as peat,
"leaf mold, compost, or
rooted...
rotted manure. "
I think you've got it, Stanley.
"And though spirit...
"and the spirit of God
"hovered over the
face of the waters,
"and God said
let there be light,
and there was light"!
Amen.
Oh!
Whoo!
Shh! Shh!
What's the matter with you?
This is a library.
I know it's a library, lady.
It's my library.
You can't afford this hotel.
On this occasion, yes, I can.
Is that everything, sir?
That's fine.
Thank you.
How much did
you give him?
Too much,
but I'm feeling generous.
You like this room?
This room is where
I'm going to die.
Want to try room service?
Oh, yes.
What can we have?
Anything you want.
Um, coffee and...
2 chocolate eclairs.
Coffee, 2 chocolate eclairs.
We've even got
a scale in there.
I'm not getting on it.
Oh, no.
It's got a hole in it.
Wouldn't you know?
I brought old pajamas, too.
Maybe I won't wear it.
Maybe I won't
wear mine, either.
You know, I've never
had an affair before.
I was married
when I was young.
I was pregnant
when I was young.
I expected to always have
the same man in my life.
Let me tell you about us.
I'm going to need a
working woman. That's you.
You're going to need
a broad shoulder.
That's me.
I like you, Iris,
just about as much
as I love you,
and you know what?
We're going to do
just fine together...
And a man could drown
in your blue eyes.
You're all set.
Are they going
to feed you a meal?
Oh, I forgot to ask.
You know, I listened
to the weather report,
and I heard it's
foggy in Detroit.
They wouldn't fly
unless it's safe.
American Airlines flight 601,
nonstop to Detroit,
now boarding
through gate 2.
That's your flight.
We have a few minutes.
They're giving me an office.
You better start
wearing neckties.
And they're going
to get me a patent.
Get a lawyer.
I can read the fine print.
Get a lawyer anyway.
Oh, lord.
Stanley, have you gone
and gotten handsome?
Nah.
Same old road map.
What am I going to do
in that empty bed?
I'm going to have to
put my feet on the cat
to stay warm.
I'm going to have
to hug a pillow.
I might have to
come back rich.
How would you like that?
I'd like to tear your
ticket up is what I'd like.
I wish there was a 7-point
earthquake right now.
I'll be back, Iris.
Maybe you will,
and maybe you won't.
American Airlines announces
the final boarding call
for flight 601,
nonstop service to Detroit
Metropolitan Airport,
now boarding
through gate two.
Buckle your seat belt up
as soon as you sit down
and keep it buckled up
the whole time.
It's safer that way.
I'll call you.
No, Stanley.
Write to me.
I'll write to you.
Dear Iris.
Well, I'm settled in.
I've got an office
about as big as a closet.
It's next to the men's room
and hasn't got a window,
but my name's
on the door.
Small letters,
but it's there.
I like my boss.
He wears cowboy boots
and calls me by my first name.
He didn't graduate
high school, either,
so we've got
a lot in common.
There are lots of pretty
women in this town,
but I don't see
them for dirt.
I keep thinking
about the one
who sleeps with her
arms above her head
and has a little mole,
never mind where.
Now, I want to say
something to you,
and I want to say it right
and spell it right.
Thank you.
Not just from the bottom of
my heart, but from my head,
where ideas and
dreams come from.
I'm very grateful to you, Iris,
and that will be till
the last day of my life.
So don't catch cold.
Lock your doors at night.
Don't slip in the bathtub.
I love you.
Stanley.
Iris.
Stanley?
What are you doing here?
I came to see you.
Did you get fired?
No. In fact, I got a raise.
Climb in.
I'm... I'm really glad
to see you.
I'm happy to see you.
Is this your car?
After 24 payments,
it'll be my car.
Did you get the letters?
15 letters
and a Christmas card,
a get-well card,
a joyous Easter,
and 2 Valentines.
That's about right.
Iris, I...
Just got me a
comprehensive health plan
and 3 different kinds
of credit cards.
I got my eye on
a house in Detroit.
It's old.
It needs paint.
It's got about 6 bedrooms.
It's got only one bathroom.
You listening?
To every word.
I'd like you and the
kids to live there.
Stanley, are you
proposing to me?
I suppose I am.
You know what
you're taking on?
There were 7 visits to
the doctor last year,
5 to the dentist,
and winter coats,
summer coats, tennis shoes.
We're a noisy family,
Stanley.
We've got a lot
of arguments...
Baby crying, a lot of TV.
You sure you want
to take this on?
I'm here.
Oh.
Come here.
- Is there a school?
- 2 blocks away.
One bathroom for five people?
That's not enough.
You think we could
knock down a wall?
Iris, anything is possible.
