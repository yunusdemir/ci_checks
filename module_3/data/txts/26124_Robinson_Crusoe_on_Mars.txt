[Air Hissing]
This is Commander Christopher Draper...
the Navy of the United States
of America, planet Earth...
<i>former copilot
Mars Gravity Probe 1.</i>
On our third orbit of this planet...
we took evasive action
to avoid collision with a meteor...
and were forced into dangerous
gravitational pull of Mars.
We were forced to abandon ship.
As of now, the vehicle frame
is still orbiting Mars.
Seems to have established
gravitational balance.
[Air Hissing]
[Hissing Stops]
We ejected capsule without incident...
Colonel Dan McReady ejecting after I did.
I'll set out to look for him tomorrow.
From all indications, he should be on the other
side of a high range of rocky peaks to the west.
Now, my two most difficult
problems are air and water.
I have, with what's left in my tank and one
reserve cylinder, enough oxygen for...
oh, about 60 hours...
depending, of course,
on how much I exert myself.
My first discovery was that the air on Mars
is far too thin to support human life.
As to water, by severe rationing,
I can get by for about 15 days.
Course, once my air gives out,
water won't matter.
First positive survival point:
I found a yellow rock.
It's as burnable
as some of our poorer grades of coal.
Heat's uneven, but it should make
the Martian nights endurable.
[Air Hissing]
I feel a little bit like Columbus...
set down in a strange new land...
full of new wonders...
new discoveries.
It's a challenge, all right -
a challenge to my training.
Sometimes challenges
can get mighty big.
But I'm gonna stay alive,
believe me.
That's for the morale officer.

[Breathing Erratically]
[Gasping]
[Groans]
[Gasping]
[Grunts]
[Air Hissing]
Well, I've licked the heat
and shelter problem.
Breathing - that's a different story.
Moving about, exerting myself,
I've found that I can...
breathe the air of Mars for about,
oh, 12 to 15 minutes...
before I need to take air
from my tank for a booster.
Lying down, asleep...
inactive, I can get by for an hour
before taking a booster.
In this way, with some discomfort,
I can conserve my oxygen supply.
At the most optimistic appraisal...
I have 50 or so hours of life left...
God willing.
The problem is sleeping.
If I don't wake up in time to renew
my air supply, it's hearts and flowers.
I've got to make some kind of
alarm device, safeguard myself.
[Clangs]
Tomorrow - and morning's only
a couple of hours away-
I'm gonna rejoin Mac.
Good old Mac.

these problems licked.

Where do they get the oxygen to burn?
It must be similar to solid rocket fuel
with its own built-in oxygen.
Heat and flame release it.
And it's breathable.
I've gotta find some way to store it.

Good old Woodward.
You used to be about as interesting
as a common brick.
Now, Professor,
I'm glad to have you aboard.
This second phase of survival,
finding water...
will deal with locating
water on another planet.
Since no one has landed
on another planet yet -
- Oh, is that so?
- We will have to proceed...
with hypothetical knowledge
from our studies here on Earth.
- I can give you a tip from here on Mars.
- Water is where you find it.
<i>Like gold.</i>
The thing is to know where to find it.
And you must make sure it's potable.
- Don't drink seawater.
- No seas here.
Seawater's too salty.
So's urine.
<i>- [Squawks]
- Rain and snow...</i>
become groundwater
and sink in under the ground.
- No rain. No snow.
- On some dry, desert planets...
it may be possible to crush rocks...
and extract latent water from them.
Good night, Professor.
Thanks for the heart-to-heart.

A guy can lick the problems of heat,

And here's the hairiest problem of all -
isolation, being alone.
Boy, here's where he'll crack.
Here's where he'll go under.
I know, I know. I had great training,
including two months in the isolation chamber.
But when I was in that chamber,
I knew I was coming out.
I knew I'd be with people again.
But up here on Mars...
you've gotta face the reality
of being alone forever.
