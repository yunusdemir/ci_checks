 He's gettin' married in 30 minutes.
 Hey... There you are.
 How are you doin'?
 l don't know, man.
 l stopped drinkin' and started thinkin'.
 You shouldn't have done that.
 l don't know if l can do this thing, Jim.
 Come on, Graham.
 l'll be there, right by your side.
 We'll do this thing together.
 What do you mean, ''we'', paleface?
 - l gotta get dressed.
 - All right, man.
 Lighten up, Chief.
 - The best is all ahead of you.
 - Like what?
 - Marriage, children, a commitment.
 - lt's too horrible to even think about.
 Look, l have a commitment...
 to the teams.
 The teams aren't gonna last for ever.
 Then what are you gonna come home to?
 A fridge full of beer and an address book
 full of phone numbers, that's what.
 Coming from a guy whose marriage
 lasted all of what, a year and a half?
 You should consider the source.
 - ls this really what you wanna do, Billy?
 - Yeah.
 Hell, l guess so.
 You guess so. Well, that's beautiful.
 Well, l'm sorry, guys, but l cannot be
 a part of this funeral procession.
 See you later!
 He's a crazy motherfucker!
 - l hope he dies of pneumonia.
 - Did you see that shit?
 Thank you!
 What the hell am l doing?
 l hardly know this woman.
 You've known her three years, Chief.
 We gotta go... now.
 - Sorry, honey. l gotta go.
 - Now?
 This minute.
 This is some kind ofjoke, right?
 - Sorry, Jo. Excuse me.
 - l know this is bad timing.
 With you guys it's always bad timing.
 l'll call you when l can.
 Close call, Chief!
 He was either born lucky or unlucky.
 l can't figure which.
 - lt's over?
 - Never happened.
 That was quick.
 - What's goin' on?
 - Balloon went up. Get in.
 Gentlemen, there's a God in heaven.
 You bastard!
 Leave him alone, you son of a bitch!
 - Clear!
 - Clear!
 Real clear.
 Search team in. X-Ray, this is Bad Karma.
 Objective secured.
 Bad Karma, X-Ray!
 What is yoursituation? Over!
 Preparing to move.
 Three passengers. On schedule.
 We're a SEAL team. We'll get you out.
 - l believe you.
 - 50 seconds.
 Bad guy.
 Bad guy.
 l want you to relax, OK?
 We got a locked door over here.
 Hawkins, don't break...
 Damn it!
 - We got an unknown in here.
 - We're compromised. Everybody out!
 l got him.
 - What's he saying?
 - He says he's an Egyptian sailor.
 - Take his fucking picture!
 - All right. l got it.
 Bad guys thought he was a spy.
 They beat the shit out of him.
 Egyptian sailor, my ass! l oughta
 smoke this piece of shit right here.
 Hawkins! Damn it! Let's go!
 What was that shit at the door?
 Room service.
 - Where is he?
 - Rooftop! Back of us!
 God?
 God here!
 God, we got a single shooter,
 southeast tower!
 Yeah, l see him.
 Nice shot, but you got two more.
 Got nothing on starlight.
 Switching to thermal.
 Hold on.
 - God, what's ourstatus?
 - They're not moving. You're clear.
 Let's move out!
 Get those men inside!
 - We are meeting heavy resistance!
 - What the fuck is this?! Some soft target!
 - They're coming out of the woodwork!
 - Bad guys! Alley! To the rear!
 Hang on! Goddamn it. We're losing him.
 - We gotta get him outta here.
 - Partying now!
 Come on, we gotta move!
 All units,
 we're cut off from our primary LZ.
 Going to LZ Two.
 Repeat, going to LZ Two.
 Bad Karma, X-Ray! Roger!
 You're pissing me off. Cool out!
 Oh, l am cool.
 You should see me when l'm hot.
 - You gotta buy us some time.
 - How much do you want?
 Bird leaves at 0245. Be there or swim.
 - We got more comin'!
 - Ramos, give me your hand.
 Graham! Cover me!
 l hope these fuckers paid their gas bill.
 - Case of beer, Billy!
 - You got it!
 Shit! Follow me!
 Why aren't they firing?
 That's why. Stingers.
 Shit! Guided missiles?
 Jackpot. Bad Karma Leader, this is
 Bad Karma Two. Do you copy? Over.
 Leader, this is Two. Do you copy?
 Leader, this is Two. Do you copy?
 - May l?
 - What do you have in mind?
 Well...
 l'm gonna do this.
 Shit!
 And now...
 - l'm gonna do this.
 - Goddamn it, Hawkins!
 - lt didn't blow.
 - No shit, sir!
 Behind those bags.
 Take cover. Let's set perimeters.
 X-Ray, Bad Karma! We're extracting!
 Sniper on the wall!
 There's another one!
 Bad Karma, X-Ray coming in! Take it five!
 - Come on! We gotta go!
 - Where's Hawkins?
 Bad Karma, X-Ray grounded!
 Load 'em up! Come on! Let's go!
 All right! Extract! Everybody go!
 Go!
 We just found an entire warehouse
 full of missiles!
 - We gotta blow 'em!
 - What?
 Missiles!
 - No! We're extracting!
 - Give me the breaching charges!
 - No! We're extracting!
 - l can handle it!
 Let's move out! Go!
 Come on! Move! ln!
 Yankee Bravo, X-Ray! Pickup complete!
 RTB! ETA ten minutes!
 - How's he doin'?
 - l think he'll be OK.
 - Good.
 - Lieutenant,
 l really... You guys are incredible.
 Thank you.
 There's no reason to thank us,
 because we don't exist.
 You never saw us. This never happened.
 Yankee Bravo, X-Ray! On final! Tally-ho!
 One more thing.
 You're welcome.
 Yankee Bravo, X-Ray! Roger!
 Steady 306! Needle's good on the ball!
 X-Ray to Bravo! Clear to land! Pad two!
 - Describe your method of entry.
 - l came through a skylight.
 - And you had contact in the hallway?
 - One confirmed.
 What was your action
 at the objective area?
 l entered the room in the third position.
 Swept left to right.
 - Did you fire your weapon?
 - Fuckin' A... sir.
 - There were no other documents?
 - l got everything in the room.
 - Everything?
 - Everything but the onions.
 Crew chief was dead.
 Copilot had serious internal injuries.
 l stabilised him, prepared to move.
 That's when the shit hit the fan.
 The primary LZ was aborted. l covered
 their movement to the secondary.
 You engaged hostiles?
 l vaporised hostiles.
 Why did you decide to break silence
 and blow the door?
 l heard something.
 We all hear things.
 Some of us react differently.
 - Some of us don't react at all.
 - Why did you let this man go?
 l had a plane to catch.
 Can you tell us why
 you elected not to go back in
 and blow up the missiles, Lieutenant?
 l had one dead and two wounded.
 l didn't have time to dick around.
 You consider searching for
 important munitions dicking around?
 Hey, don't point the finger at me
 about something you guys at lntel
 should've known about in the first place.
 By the way, thanks for the hot tip
 on the hundred assholes
 we encountered at your soft target.
 - l wonder why they call it intelligence.
 - That'll be enough, Lieutenant.
 Hey, mail for the boat.
 LT, wanna lose some of that combat pay?
 No. l'll keep my 60 bucks, thanks.
 Am l interrupting something?
 No.
 l thought you might
 want to take a look at that.
 Could have used this a week ago.
 - Yeah, well, who knew?
 - Goddamn.
 l am still jacked up.
 You wanna talk about a rush. Fuck me!
 Keep that emotion under control.
 Yeah, but it's flowin' through me, boss.
 lt's flowin' right through me.
 That high is not the one
 you're looking for.
 Believe me.
 - End of lecture?
 - Yeah, for now.
 You cannot invade ourland
 and talk about security!
 You cannot send soldiers into ourhomes
 and talk aboutpeace!
 You cannot kill a man's family
 and talk about human rights!
 You wage this war
 with acts ofterrorism against civilians!
 lfAmerica kills ourpeople,
 then ourpeople will kill Americans!
 As in the bombing ofthe Marine barracks
 in Beirut in 1983?
 ln the reprisal
 for the shelling ofourhomes
 and the murder ofour families
 by American warships!
 He's a real sweetheart, huh?
 - How does he fit in over there?
 - Shaheed?
 He emerged as leader of a group.
 - Al Shuhada.
 - Al Shu-hada.
 - Whatever.
 - Who are they?
 They just put a new team in the field.
 We know next to nothing, but we believe
 they're connected to the Hizballah.
 Jesus! We don't know much, do we?
 Who's that reporter?
 - Claire Verens?
 - How come she's so knowledgeable?
 She's half-Lebanese.
 She has contacts over there.
 She covered the Mideast
 for the networks.
 She's a reporter.
 She's not gonna give us anything.
 What they've got is the perfect
 terrorist weapon. Portable, hand-held.
 Jesus! What a mess!
 Those fanatics have got a warehouse
 full of these missiles.
 Why didn't you blow those things
 when you had the chance?
 The lieutenant made a decision under fire.
 - We stand behind that decision.
 - Navy SEALs are paid to take risks.
 They're paid to get shot at,
 to die if necessary.
 - l take exception to that decision.
 - Damn it, Warren.
 The point here is not what might have
 been done, but what we do now.
 With due respect, sir,
 let me take my team back in there.
 With my first-hand
 knowledge of this Shaheed...
 That's up to the President.
 We'll see if he wants to give
 your SEALs another opportunity.
 Nobody's blaming
 the SEALs or you, Curran.
 Sir, l only care about the safety of my
 team and getting those Stingers back.
 No one knows where those missiles are.
 lt's up to the intelligence community now.
 lt's out of our hands.
 - l don't accept that.
 - lt's out of your hands.
 You're an operator, not a policymaker.
 Get used to it.
 l had him. l should have taken him out
 when l had him.
 How do you know
 you would have made it?
 More than likely you and your team
 would have been waxed.
 Well, like the man says,
 that's what we're paid to do.
 l want your team
 to stand down for a while.
 Relax. Cool out.
 Get some perspective on this, all right?
 Lieutenant?
 Aye, sir.
 Keep your head down, hotshot!
 - Fellow cake-eater.
 - Hotshot.
 - Brain grenade?
 - Sure.
 Are you still thinking about bad guys?
 - As a matter of fact, l am.
 - lt's old news, man.
 We go in there, we hit 'em and forget 'em.
 lt's what we do, right?
 There's more to it than that.
 lf you got a problem,
 do something about it.
 Stick it out, but don't be afraid
 to get it cut off. That's what l always say.
 You gotta get these emotions
 under control, son.
 l need to know if this is what you want.
 Jo, l want this.
 l love you and l wanna marry you.
 But you know who l am.
 - And you just gotta understand...
 - l understand. l do.
 l know that you can be pulled away
 at any time to go anywhere. l know that.
 lf anybody knows that, l do.
 lt's part of the package
 and l'm in it for the long haul.
 l love you, Billy.
 Let the man shoot.
 Just take it easy. 50 dollars on this.
 Wait a minute.
 That's my car. He's taking my car!
 That's what you get
 for parking on the fairway, Hawkins!
 Wait a minute!
 OK, gentlemen. We're getting
 another shot at those missiles.
 Satellite photos show them located
 in a merchant vessel called
 the Latanya bound for Lebanon.
 The ship's packed with Muslim pilgrims
 which could present a hostage situation.
 - How many terrorists, sir?
 - We don't know.
 So what do we do
 about the hostage situation?
 Avoid it. At all costs.
 The last thing we want
 is an international incident.
 The missiles could be booby-trapped.
 Locate them
 and call the bomb disposal group.
 Sounds like a real pleasure cruise.
 Your insertion platform is the USN Nayak,
 presently shadowing the Latanya
 off the coast of Syria.
 - Captain.
 - Well, here she is, gentlemen.
 Looks peaceful enough.
 Let's go swimming.
 The op's a go!
 Equipment check in 30 mikes!
 You heard the man. Let's rock the box.
 Lockout chamber clear.
 Let's go, Lieutenant.
 Up! Up!
 - Open it up.
 - Valve's open to the max.
 Ask him where the gunmen are.
 - There are none.
 - Ask him about the missiles.
 Nothing.
 He's runnin' out of time.
 What gunmen? What missiles?
 This is a merchant ship.
 We're carrying machine parts.
 What the hell's goin' on here?
 We got the right ship.
 - What was that?
 - Deal with him! Rexer!
 You stay.
 - Leader, we've had an explosion.
 - What kind ofexplosion?
 Hawkins, what's your status?
 - Hawkins, talk to me!
 - Hold on.
 - What's he saying?
 - Something about your mother.
 Never talk about Mom.
 - What's this?
 - Looks like a dead terrorist to me, boss.
 - What happened?
 - Capped a bad guy down in the hold.
 - He fell on his own booby trap.
 - Round everybody up, pat 'em down.
 - Let's get EOD in here.
 - You got it.
 l've got nine crates in the forward hold!
 Lieutenant,
 l think you boys have been had.
 No shit.
 True lslam
 does not preach terrorism.
 True lslam is one of the most tolerant
 of the world's religions,
 accepting Christians and Jews
 as people of the same God.
 True lslam also preaches
 equality and justice.
 The Shiite Muslims of Lebanon
 have seen little of either.
 Fourteen years of devastating civil war
 have given rise to small
 but militant groups of fundamentalists
 who believe the very survival
 of their faith is at stake.
 And then tolerance fades,
 and faith turns to anger.
 For the Al Shuhada of Lebanon,
 it's turned to absolute rage.
 Perfect.
 OK, that's it.
 l wanted to ask you a couple of questions.
 l'm interested in your work
 and l thought l might be able to look at
 some of your research material.
 Who are you? Who do you represent?
 My name is James Curran.
 l don't represent anyone. l'm in the Navy.
 And what do you do for the Navy?
 l'm with the teams.
 - A SEAL, huh?
 - That's right.
 Let's have lunch.
 Why do you keep going back
 to the Al Shuhada?
 ls there something about this group
 that interests you?
 No.
 You know, l don't think we're having
 a Mideast current affairs lesson here.
 l think we're talking about missiles.
 Missiles?
 Why do you think l'm sitting here?
 l have strong contacts telling me that
 US missiles have found their way there.
 Now l have a Navy SEAL
 asking me questions about Shaheed.
 Are you telling me
 the Al Shuhada has US missiles?
 No. You're telling me.
 - l didn't say anything.
 - Me neither.
 Come on, Lieutenant.
 What are the SEALs up to?
 Nothing special. Training.
 May l take a look?
 Sure.
 Only about 10% will make it.
 For these guys it's all about endurance.
 All that and a paycheck too?
 A very small one.
 - These guys, they don't do it for money.
 - What?
 - They don't do it for money.
 - Then why do they do it?
 l guess we're trying to prove
 something to ourselves.
 lt's called a dive tower.
 What are they doing exactly?
 They're simulating
 planting explosives on a ship's hull.
 So you really think
 they're keeping the missiles on a ship?
 This is normal training, Claire.
 Lieutenant Scott,
 you have a telephone call on line three!
 - That's normal?
 - No, that's abnormal.
 That's Hawkins. He's part-fish.
 l think we'd better get out of here
 before he presses something else
 up against the window.
 You ever had any Mideast assignments?
 - Beirut.
 - When?
 '83, '84.
 So you were there during the bombing
 of the Marine barracks?
 Yeah, l was there all right.
 Lost a couple of good friends that day.
 So are you gonna tell me what
 l wanna know about the missiles?
 You don't seem to understand.
 l'm a journalist, not a spy.
 What's this, the officers' club?
 No. We call this the kill house.
 We use it for CQB.
 Close-quarters battle.
 Sounds like fun.
 lt is.
 - Clear!
 - Clear!
 Thanks.
 She's not upset, is she, Lieutenant?
 Sweet!
 What the hell was that about?
 Being in the middle of a war and not
 being able to do a damn thing about it!
 You know he's got the missiles.
 l know he's got the missiles.
 What are we gonna do about it?
 - Are you goin' after him?
 - lf we find him. Where is he?
 - l don't know.
 - Who does?
 l don't know.
 l don't know what l can tell you.
 Good evening, sir.
 Welcome to ll Giardino!
 - Thank you.
 - You're welcome.
 ln the fireplace room. Right this way.
 - Hey, Hawk. How you doin'?
 - Hi, Ruth. How you doin'?
 l'm just gonna borrow your phone.
 - Right this way, please.
 - Great. Thanks.
 Yes, can l have the Command
 Duty Officer, please? Thank you.
 This is Captain Dunne.
 Beep Lieutenant Curran immediately.
 Right away.
 And you made your home
 in the Navy, right?
 Not necessarily. How about you?
 Hi, girls! What's happenin'?
 - Hi.
 - Good to see you.
 - There's a familiar face! Dale Hawkins.
 - Pleased to meet you.
 This is Claire Verens. She's a journalist.
 - She specialises in the Middle East.
 - Well, Beirut, really.
 One of my favourite spots.
 What a shithole!
 You been there?
 Are you kidding? Rags knocking
 each other off like the national pastime.
 Rags?
 Ragheads. Ay-rabs.
 l think they're all
 a few sandwiches shy of a picnic.
 l happen to be half-rag myself.
 My mother's Lebanese.
 ls she?
 Oh, well,
 l guess l've done it again, haven't l?
 - What's new?
 - l'm sorry. l didn't mean to offend you.
 l was just... being me, you know?
 What's up?
 l've gotta leave. l'm sorry.
 - Can l give you a call?
 - Yeah, sure.
 - That's fine.
 - Can you give her a ride home?
 Gladly.
 l'll be fine.
 We'll see you around, boss.
 So... where were we?
 Well, l was insulting your heritage
 and now we're having dinner.
 - Enjoy.
 - Thank you.
 So l guess growing up in the wetback
 section of Fresno wasn't that bad.
 - lt was...
 - You mean Mexican?
 ..wet. Depends
 if they're working for you or not.
 You're gonna make me think before l talk,
 aren't you?
 l'm sure that'd be a first.
 Anyways,
 my mom taught school and my dad,
 when he did work,
 he used to supervise fruit pickers.
 He had to drive around the fields
 in a golf cart cos a Jap...
 ..-anese mine blew both of his feet off,
 so he couldn't get around too well.
 He's a good guy, but he thinks l'm nuts
 for being a full-time frogman.
 What are we doing?
 Well, hopefully each other
 if all goes as planned.
 You don't like these guys?
 Well, me neither.
 So, you got a favourite tune?
 Yeah. Do you know ''Turn the car around
 and take me to my hotel''?
 What's wrong? Look, we got
 a beautiful ocean, the moon,
 two people attracted to each other.
 Two?
 Well, one out of two ain't bad, huh?
 See you.
 Wait a minute. Claire.
 Come on. Claire! Hey!
 Wait a minute.
 Now, look. You're a vaguely amusing
 and not unattractive guy,
 but l'm not even remotely interested.
 And if you don't take me to my hotel,
 that means l have to walk.
 So l guess the weekend in Bora Bora
 is out of the question, right?
 Come on.
 - Nice move.
 - What's the matter with you?
 What's the matter with you? Hey,
 trust me with your life but not your wife.
 You're an asshole!
 Oh, what is up with you?
 Am l missing something here?
 - Yeah, a lot.
 - Why don't you fill me in?
 l told her about the Stingers.
 Shaheed.
 Oh, that's great.
 Why the hell did you do that?
 lnformation.
 Who are you? The goddamn CIA now?
 CIA's givin' us nothing.
 They never have and they never will.
 She's all we've got.
 We've still got her, don't we, Hawkins?
 Oh, yeah. She's still around. Sure.
 Help me out with this.
 OK. You got me.
 All you had to do was say somethin'.
 Our lead story!  a privatejet carrying
 an Algerian negotiating committee
 was shot down this morning
 as it left the airport in Madrid!
 Seven passengers
 and two crewmen died!
 - What's up, skipper?
 - Take a look at this.
 Unconfirmed reports say
 the weapon which downed the plane
 was an American-built,
 hand-held missile called the Stinger!
 Two men believed responsible
 were captured!
 Spanish police say they have evidence
 that more attacks are planned!
 Did you hear what happened?
 Your defender of religious faith just blew
 a peace commission out of the sky.
 lt's happening, Claire.
 Help us! Give me some information.
 Something. Anything!
 Why can't you understand? l don't create
 the news. l report it. l'm a journalist.
 - You're involved!
 - l won't be an accomplice.
 Who are you helping
 by not giving me any information?
 All right.
 Write your story. And the next one.
 And when the next plane is shot down,
 make sure you get the names and ages
 of the victims right.
 OK.
 But l can't volunteer anything.
 You ask the questions
 and l'll try and answer what l know.
 All right.
 l think l've got something.
 Walid Fahladi.
 Wasn't he with Shaheed's go-between
 - at the second meeting that you had in...
 - Balbeck. Right.
 - Right. Now we're getting someplace.
 - He dropped out of sight six months ago.
 - What are you talking about?
 - Disappeared. Kidnapping, probably.
 Great.
 Now, that is the best goddamn idea
 l've heard all day.
 - What?
 - What you just said.
 What did l just say?
 Why don't we go in, grab one of
 these cheese-dicks and make 'em talk?
 Sounds great.
 - l don't think she's taking us seriously.
 - What do you expect?
 l don't think you understand the situation.
 These guys are religious zealots.
 There's no way you could make 'em talk.
 - You're dealing with extremists.
 - You're dealing with Navy SEALs.
 OK.
 All right. l've heard enough.
 l've heard enough.
 l can assure you that we will take no part
 in the kidnapping of a foreign national.
 - Warren, hear him out.
 - No. l appreciate your zeal,
 - but it's totally out of the question.
 - Wait. We know this guy.
 - You know him, Elliott?
 - Yeah, a paid asset.
 We've bought information from him.
 l thought he was a little fish.
 lf he has information,
 why hasn't he contacted you?
 No, it isn't.
 Just because we aren't expecting
 resistance, don't relax on this one.
 How you doin'?
 l hate jumping out
 of a perfectly good airplane.
 You don't gotta love it.
 You just gotta do it!
 What's our altitude?
 - What's our altitude?
 - lt's about 30,000. That's six miles up.
 You guys are crazy.
 That's right! And proud of it, baby!
 Zebra 23, six minutes to launch point!
 Copy, Black Fire!
 Roger. Six minutes.
 Six minutes!
 Hey, man, what's with the goggles?
 You look like you're underwater already.
 Eat shit!
 OK, gentlemen, grab yourmasks!
 We're beginning to depressurise!
 We are going to depressurise here!
 Let's go!
 Jesus, Dane!
 Who the fuck packed your chute?
 lt doesn't look good.
 l wouldn't jump it if l were you.
 All right, gentlemen. Stand by.
 On the green!
 One more thing.
 For God's sakes, be careful out there!
 lf l was careful, l'd be in the Coast Guard.
 Five, four, three, two, one.
 Go! Go! Go!
 Oh, shit!
 Shit! Graham's got a streamer!
 Graham! Release!
 Release, Graham!
 Bail! Bail! Bail!
 Get away, Graham!
 Pull out!
 Pull out, Graham! Pull!
 Pull!
 Two booger-eaters dead ahead!
 Easy.
 There she is.
 - Try and stay awake.
 - You bet.
 Team, this is Leader. We're in.
 - Leader, this is God! l'm in position!
 - This is Five! Security set!
 Two, this is Leader. What's your status?
 Leader, this is Two. l'm in position.
 Leader, this is Four.

 Four, this is Leader.
 ls he gonna be a problem?
 Leader, this is Three.
 Ramos ain't being rude.
 Our stroller just camped out
 in his back yard.
 What's his status?
 lf he was any closer, he'd be inside him.
 All right. Let's try to keep it quiet.
 We don't need a confrontation right now.
 You got it.
 Leader... Party just got bigger.
 And they brought their fireworks!
 lf l'm not there, Chief, you make the call.
 Three, this is Two. You need some help?
 Negative, Two.

 Ramos, we're clear?
 Clear.

 Let's go tag 'em and bag 'em.
 Hey, Chief.

 How did he die?
 lt was a training accident.
 Bullshit.

 You can take all of that classified,
 unsung hero stuff and shove it!
 Tell me something, James.
 lt may seem simple to you,
 but if we had been married,

 Yeah.
 You would have gotten a flag.

 Hell, yeah. Turn it on!
 We're watching the Cuervo Gold
 Golf Classic, OK? Thanks.

 Cos if it ain't, butt out.
 You want me to butt out? Right, yeah.
 This guy wants a beer bottle
 shoved up his ass.
 Butt out.
 - Now who you tellin' to butt out?
 - Hey! Excuse me.
 We just lost a good buddy. Same guy
 that happens to be on that television.
 We're having drinks to say goodbye.
 Now why don't you say goodbye?
 Fucking asshole!
 l love you.
 A toast!
 Chief!
 The best friend a guy ever had.
 What's your problem?
 My toast not good enough for you?
 You still don't get it, do you?
 Don't you take any responsibility
 for what happened?
 How come you left the doorway?
 You looking for a fight?
 You looking for a rush? A little rush?
 Well, l hope you got it.
 Cos you're toasting a man
 you put in the grave.
 All right!
 All right, l did! l fucked up!
 l fucked up and he's gone!
 And there isn't a damn thing
 l can do about it!
 So what do you want from me? Huh?
 Excuse me!
 The party's over here. Oh, please!
 No? l tried.
 Hello?
 You OK?
 So when he tells you where the missiles
 are, does that mean you have to go back?
 Yeah.
 - You should...
 - What?
 Nothing. lt's...
 They found them.
 So Mohammed spilled the beans, huh?
 Hey! l'm still a part of this fucking outfit!
 All right. Grab your gear.
 We're going to Beirut.
 The missiles are located in a
 schoolhouse in the Shiite slums of Beirut.
 A contact from the Amal militia will
 meet you on the beach and take you in.
 Heavy fighting has just broken out,
 so don't get involved.
 Just get to the missiles and blow them.
 Be back in the water by dawn.
 - See you on the sub.
 - Make sure you're there.
 Let's stash these boats!
 Where the hell's this guy
 we're supposed to meet? He's late.
 You're late.
 Are you from Amal?
 Ali.
 Christ, he's just a kid.
 l guess the kid's on point.
 lncoming!
 Go! Go! Go!
 Hit it! Hit it!
 Dark side of the moon, guys.
 Green line.
 Druze, Amal, Hizballah, Al Shuhada.
 lsrael.
 The asshole of misery.
 This ain't our beef, guys.
 Let's move out.
 Now knock it off! We need you!
 - Watch the kid!
 - Like he was my own.
 l'm going to high ground!
 Find it!
 - Cover me!
 - Go!
 Fuck!
 - Hawkins!
 - Go!
 - Fucking kid led us into a shit-storm!
 - What was your first clue?
 Bad Karma, this is God.
 l'm about 100 metres
 to the west of your position.
 Have multiple targets sighted.
 God, this is Bad Karma! Come in!
 God, this is Bad Karma. Come in!
 - Right. l'm gonna go check it out.
 - Keep me posted.
 You guys, l've got company up here.
 You're an American?
 God. Come in, God.
 Your God doesn't help you now.
 Dane?
 Hi, Lieutenant.
 - Are you all right?
 - Oh, yeah.
 - Get us out of here, kid.
 - Come.
 - There.

 There.

 Looks like we got
 a slumber party on the third floor.
 Looks like about it.
 All right.

 l want in on this, Lieutenant.
 - OK, let's do it.
 - You might need this.
 Come on, guys.
 - Clear.
 - Clear.
 - Bingo.
 - Verify it.
 Let's pray for rain.
 Jesus Christ!
 Go to work.
 Piece of cake.
 Christ, the sun'll be up
 in 10 or 15 minutes.
 When that light hits the water,
 this boat'll be compromised.
 l'm sorry. ln 20 minutes,
 we're outta here, SEALs or no SEALs.
 Relax. They'll be here.
 Leader, this is Two.
 lt's getting real bright out here.
 - What the fuck are they doing in there?
 - Maybe they're having breakfast.
 Be advised.
 We have movement on the second floor.
 Boring conversation.
 Leader, we're gonna have company.
 Rexer! Leary! We gotta go!
 Do it.
 He's hit! Curran's hit.
 Hello again, scumbag!
 Hawkins! Blow it!
 - Sorry, boss. l can't do that.
 - Sounds like an order to me.
 - Fuck his order!
 - Blow it. Blow it.
 Leary, maintain your field of fire.
 Keep their fucking heads down.
 Hawkins, yeah, OK. l'm going high.
 Rexer, get an angle on that balcony.
 lf he shows you a piece, blow it off.
 Ramos, when l break cover,
 you rock the front of that building.
 Here. You might need this.
 This is Two. l'm pinned down.
 Ramos, jump on the 50.
 Put that fucker on his knees.
 Hang tight.
 Power is on its way.
 Take that, Shaheed.
 SEAL team. l'm gonna get you out.
 - Oh, Christ!
 - Come on.
 This is Two. We're movin'.
 Blow it, Ramos!
 - Are you all right?
 - Never better!
 We need some help over here!
 Go, go, go, go!
 - l'm out of ammo here.
 - You got any mags?
 Morphine syrette.
 Give me a morphine syrette.
 - Looks like an abdominal and a thigh.
 - Dress it. Quickly.
 OK, let go. Let go for a second.
 You're really gonna love this.
 Wow!
 - Help him, Rexer. Ramos, you got rear!
 - l got one mag left.
 Use it! Come on, pull it!
 Let's hit the beach!
 Come on! Move your fucking ass!
 Out! Get out!

 Go!
 Put your fucking heads down!
 - Back down here.
 - All right.
 lt's a one-way street!
 Oh, shit!
 We know the ocean is west and we're
 travelling east, so where the fuck are we?
 Lost.
 lt looks the same. lt all looks the same!
 Stay left.
 The sub leaves in five minutes.
 This doesn't look good.
 lt just got worse.
 l think we lost 'em.
 - Behind us!
 - Shit! He's right on my ass!
 - We gotta get outta here!
 - No, don't move! He can't get a clear shot!
 Hard right! Hard right!
 You got that missile.
 You might wanna use it.
 - l would if l could figure it out.
 - lt's a one-shot deal.
 - What?
 - You miss, we die.
 - l think we lost 'em!
 - Thank God!
 l can smell the ocean.
 We're close. Real close.
 - Fuck me!
 - Get down!
 Waste that fucker!
 Eat this!
 Outstanding!
 - Come on!
 - Rexer!
 Rexer.
 - The car's on fire, guys.
 - We gotta get outta here!
 - What about Rexer?
 - Rexer's dead. Leave him!
 Come on, Hawk! Get him up!
 Come right 270 degrees. Depth, 300.
 All ahead standard.
 Ten more minutes. That's all l ask.
 l've got 107 men aboard this
 half-billion-dollar piece of equipment.
 No way l'm gonna hazard this boat.
 All ahead standard. Depth, 300.
 Come on.
 Come on! Get up!
 They won't fuck with us in the water!
 Come on!
 Get down!
 Down!
 Clear!
 - Any sign of the sub?
 - What do you think?
 lt's typical.
 Maybe they heard something.
 Maybe.
 Maybe they heard the explosion.
 How long you guys wanna wait?
