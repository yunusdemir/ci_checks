Jerk!
Hey, baby, it's me.
I thought I'd check in.
They don't turn our phone
on until tomorrow,
And I just wanted
to say... ah-choo!
Mmm. Good night.
Okay, boy, you've got
one phone call.
This is it.
Make it short.
It's taxpayers money
you're spending.
Well, drive carefully.
<i>Tell your sister I said hello.</i>
Yeah, you, too.
What's the matter, boy?
Got no one to talk to?
We square on all this?
One giant combination
with everything on it.
Couple of sodas...
You sure you can't bring beer?
'Cause I could
really use a beer.
Hey, man, what about
my phone call?
It looks like bob
and Rita Beeson are home.
Probably just got in today.
Let's go down and say hello.
That's a good idea.
Rommel.
Come here, boy. Come on.
Honey?
Yeah.
You don't suppose
it was bob and Rita
That almost ran us over, do you?
I'll bet it was Christy
or bobby Jr.
Which one graduated this year?
I can never remember
who's older.
Huh?
Oh, my god.
There's a black man in
the Beesons' living room.
Look.
He's stealing the stereo.
Rommel! Rommel!
Judy!
Get over here.
Rommel! Rommel!
Rommel!
We can't leave Rommel.
Rommel!
He's taking everything.
We've got to call the police.
A heck of a way
to start the summer.
<i>Subject is male, black,</i>
And is to be considered
<i>armed and dangerous.</i>
What are you doing?
Looking for my other glasses.
No, I mean, where are you going?
Watch.
You can't go down there.
You don't know what's going to
happen when they arrest that man.
Phil, you're only a lawyer.
Rommel, where's your leash?
What?, look.
The police are here.
That was fast.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Oh!
Damn.
Will you take the flashlight
Out of my eyes?
I'm sorry.
Step away from the car, please.
You folks are going to
have to vacate the area.
We've got some trouble up here.
We're the ones who called you.
Officer, it's okay.
My husband is a lawyer.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes.
Sir, uh, excuse me.
Oh, sure.
Chief, this couple
right over here
Are the people who called
in a little while ago.
What are their names?
I don't know.
You didn't get their names?
Evening.
Hi.
Chief Tolliver.
You're the people
who reported this?
Phil Gillman.
How are you?
Yes, we did.
Judy Gillman.
We called right away.
You saw someone in the house?
What was he doing?
Believe me, chief Tolliver,
I'm not racist, I can
assure you of that,
But when you see a black man
on this island
With his arms full
of stereo equipment,
You know damn good and well
what he's doing.
You know who owns the house?
Bob and Rita Beeson.
Very nice people.
Have you seen them tonight?
Tell him about the car.
Oh, yes. Yes.
One of the kids...
We don't know which one.
Darn near hit us
While we were walking our dog.
They just got
the car for graduation.
You know how kids are.
We see the car in the driveway,
So naturally, we're assuming
that the kids are...
Hostages.
Okay, get Riley out here with
his ought-six and scope.
Whoa. Whoa.
And I want body armor
for everyone,
And I want them to wear it.
I want to thank you folks
For your help tonight.
We only did what anyone on
this island would have done.
I think it'd be best if
you go back to your house.
I've got a job to do here.
Isn't there anything else
we can do to help?
Well, actually, uh,
You could remember me this fall.
If we just stay put,
He might get in that car
And try to drive on
out of there.
We've got hostages in there.
What are you going to do, chief?
In an election year?
You're nuts tonight.
You really are.
So much excitement for you, huh?
Excuse me.
Can you tell me
Where old country road is?
I seem to be lost.
You're on old country road.
I am?
You're not a policeman, are you?
I have the curious habit
Of monitoring certain
radio frequencies.
You're a reporter.
All right, gentlemen, you all
know what the situation is.
Night ops, chief.
Any questions?
What are your names?
<i>Gillman.</i>
<i>G-I-l-l-m-a-n.</i>
<i>And Judy with a "J."</i>
Tell me what happened.
Well, uh,
<i>there was this man-</i> -
<i>It was a black man.</i>
What in the...
Good...
Darn it.
Oh, great.
I see him.
He's coming out.
Now take it easy.
Hey, dog.
Freeze! Police!
Drop your weapon!
You want the car?
Put it down!
Okay, okay, they're up.
Police.
Drop your weapon!
What?
Police...
Police!
You're under arrest!
Drop it!
I can't hear you!
Let me turn off the alarm!
Aah!
Oh! Oh!
Oh!
Aah!
Donnie! Donnie!
Oh, my god.
Oh, shit.
Riley!
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.
<i>Hold your fire.</i>
Donnie!
Donnie!
Get over here!
What are you doing?
The car alarm gave
my position away.
You opened fire.
He had a gun, chief.
I didn't see a gun.
I'm telling you.
The guy had a gun.
It looked like
a 9-millimeter.
I saw it, chief. He was
holding it in his hand.
Pointed the thing right at me.
There he is!
Put that away.
Stop it!
Stop shooting at him.
Get down.
Okay, Stan and earl,
go around to the side,
And one of you keep
an eye on the back.
Riley, you stay put.
Donnie, you come with me.
Look...
He's turning the lights off.
Now we've stepped in it.
Now we have to worry
about hostages.
Pack it up.
Let's get down there.
Can we go with you?
We're practically campaigning
For the, uh, chief of police.
We're big supporters.
Mmm. How big?
Very big.
All right, I want you
to get on the horn
To the frigging phone company
And get a direct line
into the house.
I want no other calls
going in or out of there,
Do you understand?
I'm clear.
Maybe if we're lucky,
I mean real lucky,
We can talk that guy
out of there
Before he hurts somebody.
Wipe that dirt off your face.
You're a police officer.
Hi, chief.
Waldo lake.
You been listening to that
radio of yours again?
Hi.
Hello, chief Tolliver.
Yeah.
We don't know how many family
members are in the house.
We think one of the children.
We also believe
that he had a gun.
Chief, the phone company says
They'll have us
a line into the house
In a few minutes.
Good. Good work.
<i>I'm sorry. Where was I?</i>
He had a gun.
He had a gun.
<i>He had a gun. Yeah.</i>
A 9-millimeter.
Maybe he bled to death, chief.
<i>Hi, we're not home right now,</i>
But if you leave
<i>your name, number</i>
And a brief message,
we'll get back...
Hello?
Hello?
Who is this?
Who's this?
<i>The chief of police.</i>
Thank god. There
was a man with a gun.
Look. We're outside.
We have your house surrounded.
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm all right.
We're going to get you
<i>out of there.</i>
Can you see
the man with the gun?
<i>Do you know where he is?</i>
No.
I don't see him.
<i>Where are you?</i>
I'm in an upstairs bedroom.
Can you tell me who you saw?
Was it just one man?
Yes, there was only one,
but let me warn you,
He was armed to the teeth.
I tried to turn
my car alarm off,
And he started shooting.
You should see what
he did to my front door.
Mr. Beeson?
Beeson?
My name is sterling.
Andrew sterling.
Waldo, come here.
Not the camera, okay?
Uh, Ernie, go get some
sound bites or something.
You get around, waldo.
So why does the name
Andrew sterling sound familiar?
The Andrew sterling?
Who is "the" Andrew sterling?
Andrew sterling is
a very talented man.
Well, he's very famous.
I see him all the time.
I can't quite recall
what it is he does exactly,
But I do know one thing.
What's that?
He's black.
I'd say it was
because I'm black.
Look, I know who you
are, Mr. Sterling.
Now, what exactly
are you talking about?
I'm talking about the fact
that someone on this island
Tried to kill me.
We'll get you out of there.
You just sit tight.
<i>Sit, baby.</i>
<i>Sit.</i>
<i>good. Good. Good.</i>
You work for a local station?
No. Waldo and I
are freelance.
Lie down. Beg.
Good. Good.
Most of our stuff goes
to shows that are syndicated,
But we're trying our best
to crack the networks.
We're aiming for prime time.
Cop shows, emergency rescue,
That sort of thing.
Oh.
Speak.
<i>Rommel, speak.</i>
People love reality.
Drug busts,
Homicides,
Domestic violence.
Ah!
America eats that stuff up.
Officer Donaldson,
put them in the back, please.
Could you step
into the patrol car, please?
Oh, yeah.
Come on, baby.
Oh, uh, let us know
when the show's on.
We'd hate to miss it.
Uh-huh.
Son, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to take that tape.
What about the first amendment?
<i>Fuck the first amendment.</i>
Hmm?
Mm-hmm.
Donnie, you ever hear of a guy
Named Andrew sterling?
Yeah, sure, chief.
Hasn't everybody?
Bye-bye, chief.
Good night, now.
Boy, you know, he looks tired.
Maybe he has a headache.
There is no burglar,
there is no hostage,
And there's no crime
being committed.
What about a gun, chief?
A black guy pointed
a gun right at me.
That was Andrew sterling
Trying to turn off
his goddamn car alarm.
And thanks to you and
those 2 idiots in there,
We goddamn near killed
a man in his own home.
God, if this gets out,
They'll crucify me,
come election day.
Wait a minute.
I've got an idea.
It's crazy, but I got an idea.
Amos Odell...
what do we have here?
Couple of drunk and
disorderly convictions,
Contributing to the delinquency
of a minor charge.
What do you have
to say about that?
She looked 18.
Let's cut the crap, okay?
You hopscotch your way
across 5 states.
You end up on my island
in a stolen car.
It was her father's car.
She gave me the keys.
And I suppose I could find
out what a sawed-off shotgun
And a bunch of small bills
were doing in the trunk?
Well, sir, I suppose you could.
I suppose I could, too.
This is your lucky day, pal.
I got a little
proposition for you.
Now, you're not exactly
What I'd call a professional,
But, uh, unless
you cooperate with us,
I'm sure I could
convince a, uh, judge
That you're what we
in law enforcement
Call a career criminal.
You know what I mean?
♪
You know what the voters
in this county
Are most concerned with?
Crime.
That's right...
Law and order.
Fighting crime is just as
important to my constituents
As taxes and spending.
Are you listening to me?
Uh, yes, sir.
I go in, take the guy hostage,
Give myself up,
And I'm on the first
bus out of town.
Ain't that the deal, boss?
That's the deal.
Just make sure that bus finds
Canada, and you're on it.
<i>Mr. Sterling?</i>
Where have you been?
Listen to me.
We're coming in after you.
Oh, one more thing...
Do you have a weapon?
Just a frying pan.
Look, I want you in and out
of there, you understand?
In and out.
Get your camera, Ernie.
We're back in business.
That does it!
I'm calling the local station.
There's no reason this can't
be on the 11:00 news.
I heard shots.
Don't worry.
He was shooting at us.
Where is he now?
And you were right about him
being armed to the teeth.
All right. He's in
an upstairs bedroom.
Wait a minute.
Hey.
Hold it. Hold it.
Watch out.
He's got a frying pan.
Scary.
Come on, Donnie.
Time for a little spin control.
What was that?
I hear something.
Someone's coming up the stairs.
Don't make a sound,
Mr. Sterling.
He doesn't know where you are.
I know you're in here.
<i>Mr. Sterling?</i>
Come out from under the bed.
All right. Get up.
Get up. Come on.
All right, turn around.
Let's get a good look at you.
What, uh... what are
you doing in here?
This is my house.
No kidding? This is your house?
You own this place?
Yes.
I own this place.
Sure you ain't the cook here?
Listen to me.
I bought this house.
I paid cash for it.
I own it.
It appears, uh, he bought
the house over the winter.
Of course, we're...
Proud to have him here.
It's just
too bad about this jailbreak.
It's, uh, not a very nice
welcome to the island.
Don't worry, bro.
This is just for appearances.
I'm not your brother.
Nothing personal.
Well, stick around, old buddy.
You may get that
TV show of yours yet.
Come on, Donnie, let's go.
Hope you don't mind, but
I could really use a beer.
You're an assassin, aren't you?
That's the one thing
about jail...
No beer.
That and no women,
But I was having
one of them delivered.
You tried to kill me.
Why would I want to kill you?
Because I'm a thorn in the
side of the white man.
I'm the voice of my people...
A loud, angry voice
That's not afraid to speak the
truth about white America.
What's your name?
Andrew sterling.
Mr. Sterling, apart
from being a thorn
In the side of the white man,
You got a regular job?
I hold a PH.D.
In cultural anthropology.
I teach, I lecture,
I produce and direct.
I'm also the author
of a Broadway play,
Now a motion picture.
What's it called?
Yo, brother, where art thou?
Yo, brother, where art thou?
Never heard of it.
Maybe you've heard
of the Pulitzer prize.
You won that?
I did.
How much you win?
Who sent you here?
Do you work for the government?
Because I know the FBI
keeps extensive files on me.
As a matter of fact,
I've seen them.
I wonder if they got one on me.
I want to know
who sent you here to kill me.
I have a shotgun.
You have a frying pan.
If I was here to kill you,
You'd better believe, bro,
You'd be a dead man by now.
I told you before...
I know. You're not
my brother.
Yo.
This is police chief,
Cecil Tolliver.
The house is
<i>completely surrounded.</i>
<i>There is no escape.</i>
Hey, you know who I got in here?
<i>Yes, I do</i>.
I mean, some black dude.
<i>Some black dude's
living in this house.</i>
That doesn't matter.
What matters is you let him
go and come out of there.
If you ask me, he's got
kind of an attitude problem.
You going to make me
come in there after you?
Uh, okay, okay. He's got
kind Ofan attitude problem.
You do remember <i>our deal...</i>
<i>No names, no faces,</i>
Nobody knows nothing.
I give myself up, he's got
kind of an attitude problem.
And I'm on the first bus
<i>out of town.</i>
It's the press.
<i>Okay?</i>
The press?
The real press.
Hey. Okay?
<i>Are you there?</i>
Make it 10 minutes.
10 minutes?
You heard me.
Bring it back around here!
We need a ladder.
Why read the gossip column
When you can read
the front page?
Get my necktie out of the car.
Got a cold?
Hay fever.
You got hay fever?
I got hay fever.
Only from cutting the grass.
Put me where they just
mowed the lawn, I'm a goner.
I get it bad.
What time is it?
That's a nice watch.
I've seen a watch like
that in a magazine once.
I sure wish I could get me
a watch like that someday.
I doubt you could afford it.
Who said anything
about buying one?
Donnie...
<i>Yeah, chief.</i>
Get those other guys
up here, okay?
I need some crowd control
And an eye kept on
the people of the press.
I don't want another
Vietnam out here.
<i>Roger that, chief.</i>
<i>No more Vietnamese.</i>
I'm standing live
on a dark country road,
Where after tense negotiations
An armed assailant seems finally
ready to release the hostage.
Escape, assault
with a deadly weapon,
<i>Uh, kidnapping.</i>
You can add those to a long
list of prior convictions.
<i>His name is Amos Odell.</i>
He's what we,
in law enforcement,
Refer to as <i>a career criminal.</i>
What do you know?
Excuse me.
<i>I've got a job to do.</i>
You can bet them cops out
there get half a chance,
They're going
to pull the plug on me
Like a tub full of dirty water.
Donnie.
This is...
<i>This is the chief of police.</i>
<i>Come out of the house
with your hands up.</i>
Thank you.
There he is!
What's that
son of a bitch doing?
Holy mackerel.
That's Andrew sterling.
That's Andrew sterling?
<i>Put your weapon down.
Let your hostage go.</i>
All right, listen up!
I want a million dollars,
And, uh...
and a helicopter,
Or I blow him away!
Thank you.
Fenton, you'll mess
up your nail polish.
Quiet.
Andrew sterling,
<i>the noted black author,</i>
<i>Scholar, and celebrity,</i>
And the man holding him hostage
in his exclusive island home.
I told you, brother.
I told you about those
so-called liberals
Up there on that damn island.
Hey, chief...
D.A.'s going to
send some backup
And a hostage negotiating
expert down to help out.
Tell him not to bother.
This won't last much longer.
A million dollars
and a helicopter.
My, aren't we original?
Ain't that what everyone wants?
Money and a chance to escape?
I just said it to stall them.
Exactly how did someone like you
End up on this island anyway?
I thought it was Canada.
I beg your pardon?
I don't know.
I'm from Pittsburgh.
I've never been up here before.
I must've been thinking
about some other island.
Incredible.
Yeah, well, I flunked geography,
And my sense of direction sucks.
Anyway, I'd had
a couple of beers,
And I tried to change some
American money into Canadian.
Mostly small bills.
I guess those people at the bank
Got a little suspicious,
'cause the next thing you know,
The cops showed up,
and I was busted.
Amos Odell.
You stay back.
Don't you come any closer!
Give me the gun, Amos.
Why don't you just go ahead
and shoot the nigger?
We don't want him
on this island anyway.
Drop the gun, Amos.
You're not a killer.
You're just a cheap opportunist.
Yeah? Well, that makes two
of us then, don't it?
Yeah.
Ohh!
Oh, I'm sorry about that
nigger thing, Mr. Sterling.
I just said it in order to...
Nigger that!
I hate to do this to you.
I really do.
But if I'm ever
going to make it to Canada,
It looks like I got to have at
least one ace up my sleeve.
Shirley, the reverend
fenton brunch here.
We have an emergency
situation on our hands.
We have to call out the troops.
I know it's
the middle of the night.
Pay them if you have to.
This is network television.
We need every man,
woman and child we can get.
Chief, do you
read me? Over.
Stan, earl, Riley...
You guys better forget about
those press people.
We got no one down here
<i>around this house.</i>
<i>roger. We're on our way.</i>
Chief, can you
<i>hear me? Over.</i>
Turn around.
Catch.
Chief, <i>are you okay?</i>
Let's go.
<i>Donnie, I'm moving
around the side of the house.</i>
Hey, there.
Hi.
What are you doing up here?
This is big enough
for the networks to cover.
They won't want
what we can give them.
Does this mean
we won't be on TV?
Even worse...
The chief of police
confiscated the tape.
He can't do that.
He did.
Sounds like a violation
of your first amendment rights.
That's what I said.
I have half a mind
to make a stink about this.
Phil was one of the lawyers
for the Chicago 7.
He even got his picture
in life magazine.
I was an associate, actually,
Just out of law school.
He handles personal
injury cases now.
Yes, but if I had the time,
there's nothing I'd like more
Than to argue the fine
points of the constitution.
Well, where to now, Magellan?
Oh, no. It's
that dog again.
I bet the whole
neighborhood's in on this.
Don't look like anybody's home.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Doggy, doggy, doggy...
Good boy. Quiet.
Quiet!
Sit!
Keep that animal away from me.
Hey, look at that.
I think he wants
to shake hands with you.
I'm not shaking that dog's hand.
You'll hurt his feelings
if you don't shake his hand.
No.
You think he's
going to hurt you?
I'm allergic to dogs.
You're allergic to dogs,
And you have hay fever.
Yes.
I'm allergic to dogs,
and I have hay fever.
That's too bad.
Anyway, to him, I'm probably
just another nigger.
Dogs are color-blind.
I can look at this dog
And tell he doesn't
like black people.
Well, one thing is for sure...
He won't like the next
one that comes in here
If you don't shake his hand.
Paw.
Dr. R.A. Fink,
criminal psychologist
And freelance hostage
crisis counselor.
Dr. Fink.
Call me Roy.
<i>Come now, brothers and sisters!</i>
<i>I want the sun to rise</i>
<i>On an ocean of black anger</i>
<i>At the injustices
of a racist community</i>
<i>Whose goal is to keep
a black man from living</i>
<i>Where he wants to live!</i>
Yeah!
Yeah!
Come on, now!
Get on them buses!
Come on, now!
Come on!
Now we're talking.
Damn.
What's the matter?
I thought all people like
you knew how to steal cars.
You watch too much TV, man.
And I ain't no car thief.
Never stole a car in my life
Where somebody didn't
give me the keys first.
Hmm.
No car keys in there.
White people!
<i>Hello, Amos.</i>
This is Dr. R.A. Fink...
Well, but you can call me Roy
If you like.
I'm here to help you.
I'd like to be your friend,
Amos.
Would you like to be...
<i>My friend?</i>
look what I found.
Hidden treasure.
Why don't you get out
of here while you can?
And do what, walk to Canada?
Liar.
I think maybe it's you who
watches too much television.
Not all black people use drugs.
The ones I know do.
See, he likes you.
He just had to get to
know you, that's all.
Guess you probably didn't
have a dog, growing up, huh?
Oh, we had a dog.
I thought you said
you were allergic to dogs.
I got shots.
I went in every week,
And the doctor gave
me allergy shots.
I hate shots.
I hate needles.
What about those tattoos?
Didn't they use needles?
Well, that's different.
I was drunk.
We never had no pets
when I was a kid.
My old man didn't like
animals, except to shoot.
He wouldn't even let me
have sea monkeys.
What are sea monkeys?
You know what sea monkeys are.
They sell them on the backs
of comic books and magazines.
You've seen the ads.
No.
You put them in water,
and it's like you got
This city of creatures,
all your own.
I always wanted sea monkeys,
'cause they looked really
happy in the pictures.
They swim all around,
smiling, laughing...
Whole family of them.
Yeah.
I guess I wanted my family to be
More like a sea monkey family.
So, after my old man
leaves home for good,
I start asking my old
lady for sea monkeys,
And every birthday
And every Christmas.
Finally, she gets so sick and
tired of listening to me,
That she sends away for them.
Yeah, she sent away for them.
And I was...
I was pretty excited
when they came.
What happened?
What?
What happened?
Nothing.
I poured that stuff
in the water,
And I waited and waited,
And it just got all dirty
and full of scum,
And finally, my old lady had to
flush it down the toilet.
Yeah, but, you know,
what the hell?
I never really could
follow directions.
Ow!
Hey, you cops,
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
Who is it?
It's him.
It's Amos Odell.
How'd he get
a walkie-talkie?
Chief.
He's got the chief.
Hey, you guys out there?
This is officer Donaldson.
Where's my million dollars
and my helicopter?
Just hold on a minute, Amos.
I need to know
if the chief is okay.
Okay?
I knew it.
These dumb cops think we're
still in the other house.
On my honor, officer Donaldson,
Sir,
<i>He's okay.</i>
Let him go to the window
so we can see him.
Let him go to the window
so we can see him.
Well, what if I told you
we weren't in the house?
Well, then I would have to say
That you're a liar, Amos.
Hey!
Don't talk to me about lying!
Don't make him mad.
Whatever you do,
don't make him mad.
It's all right, Amos.
We just don't want
anyone to get hurt,
<i>That's all.</i>
Then get me my money and my
chopper and be quick about it.
That's all.
<i>Good night.</i>
He's gone.
Uh, I'm going to go
call him in private.
He's reaching out.
He seems to want
to communicate now.
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.
♪
You want my sweater, honey?
No.
I'm going to go back.
The dog needs to get out anyway.
You sure?
I'm fine.
You know what Rommel
does to the house
If he's cooped up for very long.
You got a family?
I have a wife.
Yeah, I had one of them once.
You want to call her?
She's on her way to Boston
to visit her sister.
Well, we can
Call her there.
Maybe she's seen
you on the news.
Let's leave my wife
out of this, okay?
You tie one of these?
Your wife's white, isn't she?
You think you've got it
all figured out, don't you?
Hey, I see it all the time.
Black man makes
a name for himself,
Gets a little money
in his pocket.
Next thing you know,
He's got a skinny little
blonde with a tit job.
And he's living large
in a fancy-ass neighborhood,
Just trying to forget who he is
And where he comes from.
Careful now.
You ever been to new york city?
Uh-uh.
I grew up in new york.
We lived
in a nice part of Harlem.
When I was 12,
I came home one day
with some friends.
We were talking loudly and
Using the slang
we'd learned in the streets.
My father overheard us.
He told my friends to leave.
Then he marched me
into the bathroom
And washed
my mouth out with soap.
It was because he didn't
want me sounding black.
He was an educated man,
my father.
He had a college degree,
Just like his father.
He was an accountant,
Just like his father.
He worked for
a big new york firm.
There were only 2 black men
in the whole building...
My father
And the janitor.
After 38 years,
He retired, a full partner.
Less than a week later
He died.
Not one person from that job
Came to his funeral.
38 years of his life
And not one white face.
Only that broken-down
old janitor
Cared enough to show up.
My father made it in
the white man's world.
He wanted his son to make it
In the white man's world, too.
But don't you, for one second,
Think that I've
forgotten who I am
Or where I come from.
<i>Well, Amos,</i>
I just think that we're
probably very much alike,
Because I can be very passionate
And demanding
And, uh...
And have quite a temper.
Actually, I have...
A very serious temper.
But we really <i>must be able</i>
<i>To discuss our problems</i>
And resolve them in ways that
society deems acceptable.
Mmm!
Violence <i>is never the answer.</i>
Uh, yeah, the name is Rommel.
R-o-m-m-e-l.
And that's, uh,
49, old country road.
That's right.
Yeah, one giant combination
with everything on it.
Okay, sugar.
Bye.
You ordered a pizza?
Hey, man,
I didn't order a pizza.
I ordered a pizza truck.
Hi, baby.
Aah! Aah!
What?
Oh, my god.
Mr. And Mrs. Rommel,
I presume?
Please don't hurt us.
We know who you are.
Take whatever you want.
Cash, jewelry.
We got a stereo, a TV,
Cameras.
Oh, I have a very valuable
baseball card collection.
Ted Williams, rookie year.
Mint condition.
We could write you a check.
Quiet!
Sit!
Ha, ha, ha.
Not you.
Sit down.
You live here?
Well...
During the season.
"During the season"?
What season?
What's he talking about?
Just make him give you the car
keys and get out of here.
Not the car.
That car was an anniversary
present from my wife.
I'm sorry,
But I'm in kind of a tight spot.
Fork them over.
No, not me.
That was his second wife.
Get up.
Are you married,
Mr. Sterling?
May I call you Andrew?
He don't like
talking about his wife.
Oh.
She's white.
I never said that.
Oh, um...
Well, bob and Rita beeson
Were very good friends of ours,
And we'd love the opportunity
To get to know
you and your wife.
Even if she is white.
Donnie, I bet
if we wait long enough,
He'll probably just
Give himself up.
What about the chief?
Well, what are you going to do?
In an election year?
I remember my 11th birthday.
I had a party,
And my mom and dad
hired a clown.
He was a very, very funny clown,
And he juggled
and did magic tricks.
My friend ruby
peed on the floor.
She was embarrassed,
<i>but I had a good time.</i>
And then the next year, <i>my mom</i>
Called his house to hire
him for my 12th birthday.
His wife <i>answers the phone,</i>
<i>And she says,</i>
"I'm sorry. He's not
<i>a clown anymore.</i>
"he's at school learning how
to be a dental technician."
I don't think I'll ever
forget that moment.
This key doesn't work,
that key doesn't work.
What... what is this?
What, the key to the doghouse?
Where are the car keys,
Mr. Rommel?
Give me the damn keys!
All right.
Ah, Jesus.
Open the door.
<i>Then I had a rabbit.</i>
<i>His name was nosy.</i>
I really loved him, <i>but, um...</i>
<i>He scratched me,</i>
And he had to be returned
<i>to the pet store</i>.
Then I wanted a pony.
Oh, god, how I wanted a pony.
<i>They gave me turtles.</i>
<i>I had 15 turtles,</i>
And they lived
<i>in a really big tank,</i>
And we put in <i>palm trees.</i>
<i>They were plastic.</i>
I had a lot
<i>of small animals, but I...</i>
I never gave up <i>on that pony.</i>
hold your fire!
Go get him!
Open the door.
Whose side are you on, anyway?
Open the door!
Open the goddamn door!
Oh, oh!
Ow.
Uhh.
Uhh!
Aah!
I want those keys.
<i>Amos Odell,</i>
This is <i>the chief of police.</i>
Oh, thank god.
They've found us.
I know you're in there.
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>
All right, back in the house!
I'm going to give you
one more chance
To put your weapon down
and come out of that house.
Everybody on the floor!
Stay away from those windows.
You don't think
he's done anything
To hurt anybody, do you, chief?
I heard the 2 of them
talking upstairs.
Sounded like they were
getting pretty chummy to me.
How about it, Amos?
<i>You coming out of there?</i>
Give it up, man.
Those cops will kill us all.
Please.
I can recommend a good lawyer.
I recommend you shut up.
Ain't you forgetting
something, boss?
You got to be dreaming
If you think holding
Andrew sterling hostage
Is going to save your ass.
When I get my hands on
Mr. Sterling,
I'm going to charge him
with attempted murder.
Well, then I guess you
ain't heard the good news.
Say something,
Mr. Rommel.
No tricks.
Hello.
Hi.
That sterling fella
Must've had guests
for the weekend.
How'd you like them apples?
What do you want, Amos?
You give me a million dollars,
I give you a hostage.
You give me a helicopter,
I give you a hostage.
You let me fly out of here...
All right.
I saw the damn movie.
It's going to take
a little time, though.
Well, we ain't
going nowhere, boss.
Give me a hand.
Oh.
Where the hell is Donaldson?
I don't know, chief.
He was here just a while ago.
Nacho cheese,
Mr. Sterling?
Look on the bright side,
homeboy.
At least you're getting
to know your neighbors.
Ain't that right,
Mr. Rommel?
I wish you would
stop calling me Mr. Rommel.
My name is Gillman...
Phil Gillman.
Phil Gillman?
That name rings a bell.
Phil was one of the lawyers
for the Chicago 7.
Yeah, well, that
was a while ago.
"Hostage drama.
"Interview with
Phil and Judy Gillman."
What's that?
You tell me.
Oh, my god.
They spelled my name wrong.
What is it anyway?
Nothing.
It's nothing.
It's double "I."
Let's have a look at that thing.
No. No.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't have to...
There's really
nothing very important.
Uhh!
Aah!
Whoa!
Mr. And Mrs. Gillman.
Uhh.
Uhh.
Well...
What's on this, Phil?
Something kinky?
When you see a black man
<i>on this island</i>
With his arms full
<i>of stereo equipment,</i>
You know damn good and well
what he's doing.
We called the police <i>right away.</i>
You know damn good and well
<i>what he's doing.</i>
We called the police <i>right away.</i>
Talk about the sky falling.
We... we thought...
I know what you thought.
It was...
it was an honest mistake.
It was supposed to be different.
It was supposed to be
the kind of place
Where you don't
lock your doors at night.
Where you don't
count your change
At the grocery store.
Where a man in his own home
Doesn't have to worry about
being shot at
And nearly killed
by the local police
Simply because he's black!
You know, if that's true,
You have one heck
of a lawsuit pending.
Come on.
Mr. Rommel...
You ordered a large combination?
Smells good.
How'd you get past the police?
What police?
Hmm.
Well, what's so funny?
The chief of police
ain't going to look too smart
When they find out
He's been watching
an empty house all night.
What's your name?
Stacy.
Stacy.
I'm Amos.
Yeah, I know.
We've been watching you all
night at the pizza parlor.
You're a lot cuter
than your picture.
Oh.
Thank you.
Um...
You're not
Scared, are you, Stacy?
Of what?
♪ We are marchin'
up the mountain ♪
♪ With the lord above

♪ win somehow

So, why are you riding
that motorbike, huh?
I thought you had
a delivery truck.
Uh, I ride
the motorbike to work.
I'm actually on my way home.
You live on this island?
I live on the mainland.
I work at the pizza parlor
during the summers.
Um...
So, how old are you, Stacy?
17.
You got a boyfriend?
Yeah.
Are you in love with him?
Not really.
You sure are pretty.
You ever been to Canada?
No.
That's where I was headed
Before all this happened.
Yeah.
I guess it's cold up there.
Guess it all depends.
Um...
Call me.
Wait a second.
<i>We think he had a gun.</i>
I never had a gun.
You still
don't get it, do you, man?
Yeah, I get it.
They used you
to save themselves.
Now you're catching on.
Huh, huh.
What do you think
he's going to do with that?
I want you to give this
To one of them reporters.
They'll know what to do with it.
What about you?
What's going to happen to you?
Don't you worry about me.
I think
Mr. Rommel in there
Is going to give me
the keys to his car.
There's troops coming in!
Amos,
The helicopter is here.
How about my million dollars?
You got my million dollars?
Don't worry.
You'll get your money.
Every last dime of it.
Trust me.
Ready when you are, boss.
I'm standing live
On a dark country road
Where, after tense negotiations,
An armed assailant
seems finally ready
To release
the hostages he's held
Since escaping from jail
earlier in the evening...
Freeze!
<i>When I was 12 1/2,
we moved to this building</i>
Where the elevator men
<i>were really mean to me.</i>
<i>When I was 13,</i>
I was Barmitzvahed
in Boston Garden.
My Dad was a personal friend
of Red Auerbach.
Let's go!
Go!
Let's move it! We're going in!
Go! Go! Let's go!
Let's move it!
Come on, hurry up!
Come on!
Police!
Okay, I'll cover
the back stairs.
There's nothing back there?
Watch out.
Detective Holwitz!
I'm with you.
No sign of them, chief.
We checked everywhere.
Call bloodhound bob.
Tell him to bring
the twins out here.
We'll find them.
Chief Tolliver!
Chief Tolliver, we found him.
All right, Amos, where are they?
Ohh...
Where are they, Gillman?
Please, don't take my car.
All right,
You have 3 seconds to tell me
Where them keys are,
Or else...
Or else what?
One,
Two...
He won't do it.
Do what?
I'll do it.
Do what?
Three!
No, he won't.
He's not a killer.
He doesn't have it in him.
What'd you go
and tell them that for?
Because it's true.
Now what?
What are you doing?
What's he doing?
When you see a black man
on this island
With the key to a $50,000
car in his hand,
You know damn good and well
what he's doing.
Don't worry, Phil,
I'll drive careful.
Pervert.
What did you do with them, Amos?
Answer me!
Donnie?
That's not Donnie.
That's Amos Odell.
Read him his rights
And get him the hell
out of here.
Do it!
Amos Odell, you have
the right to remain silent.
Sherman, get on up there
and let them know
That reverend fenton brunch
is here,
And he means business!
Okay, you drive.
Get in.
Hey, get out!
Go on, get in.
Get in the car.
No. You're going to
have to get yourself
Another nigger to hold hostage.
Look. I ain't holding
you hostage anymore, okay?
But you got to know
we're in this together,
All right. You and me.
Amos and Andrew.
Let's go.
Don't say that.
What?
Our names...
Together.
W-why?
Well, I'll spare you
the history lesson.
Besides,
you wouldn't understand.
What do you mean
I wouldn't understand?
You don't understand, man.
We're gangsters.
We're outlaws.
"Gangsters"? "Outlaws"?
You're a nickel-and-dime
criminal, a petty crook,
And you need to
figure out very quickly
Where it is
you think you're going,
Because, let me tell you,
white boy,
You are definitely headed
in the wrong direction.
I've had enough of this.
I'm going home.
Petty crook...
Oh, yeah?
What about you?
You think the whole
world's against you
Just because you're black.
If something don't go your way,
It's because you're black.
They're out of beer, it's
because you're black.
It rains and you get wet,
It's because you're a black man.
You saw for yourself there
ain't no conspiracy here.
No plot to get you
off the island.
Nobody trying
to assassinate you.
That's all just as crazy
as thinking
That everybody with black
skin is your brother.
What do you know
about black skin?
I know for all your talk,
You're about the whitest damn
black man I've ever met.
Aah!
Would you move
out of the way, please?
As you just saw
Amos Odell being led away,
The whereabouts of his hostages,
Including black entertainer,
Andrew sterling,
Are still unknown.
Where is brother sterling?
What have they done
to brother sterling?
Reverend brunch?
Excuse me, Wendy.
Where is brother sterling?
Where is brother sterling?
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Oh, god.
I told you about
fresh-mowed grass.
Gets me every time.
There may be some truth
To what you said about me...
Ah-choo!
But don't you think
I should be able
To set up a stereo
in my own home
Without being mistaken
for a thief?
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Chief, bloodhound bob's here!
Hey, chief! We've been
watching on the TV.
The twins never tracked
nobody in no house before,
But we'll find them.
Listen to me,
brothers and sisters!
Listen to me,
brothers and sisters!
A crime has been committed
here tonight!
We got 'em. We're hot
on their trail now!
A crime against
black people everywhere!
All you people
out there, disperse!
We are here to protect
brother sterling,
And his property!
You! You, move out!
We want brother sterling!
We know he's in the house!
He is not in the house.
He is in the house!
No, he isn't.
Yes, he's in there!
I know you,
you new york liberal!
Fascist!
You people aren't welcome here.
Go back where you belong!
We'll get brother sterling
ourselves!
Come on! Forward!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Free brother sterling!
Look what you did, man!
Free brother sterling!
Give us brother sterling!
You gone set
the man's house on fire.
Damn!
I told the brother about
these so-called liberals
Up here on this damn island.
Fenton, you're just full of it.
You dragged me out...
look, I told him.
Get him, girls!
Get him!
Get him!
May I help you, young lady?
Are you a reporter?
Some people think so, yeah.
I'm supposed to give
this to a reporter.
Where did you get this?
He said you'd know
what to do with it.
Ernie...
Do you know what we have here?
Prime time.
More.
We got a movie of the week.
Maybe even a miniseries.
So, thanks to swift
and efficient police action,
This island has not fallen
prey to criminal elements.
The lives and property
of its inhabitants
Are well protected by
The cream of law enforcement.
What about Andrew sterling?
I've said this before.
We're proud to have Andrew
sterling on this island.
Hey, what are you doing?
You crazy?
Hey, come back here!
Get in!
I don't care what you say.
Dogs really like you.
What?
Aah!
Hang on!
Ohh!
What the heck is that?
That... Is my brand-new
summer home.
That just makes me want to...
You know?
What's the matter with you?
It's my house.
I just hate the thought of that
guy getting the best of us.
Who?
"Cecil Tolliver."
What are you doing?
What goes around
Comes around.
Hey, dogs! Over here!
What are you, crazy?
Those are bloodhounds, man.
That's not the family pet.
They hunt people for a living.
Hey, dogs, over here!
Whoa!
Good doggies.
Here, smell, smell.
Here.
Here, smell it.
Smell it. Go!
That's... that'll...
that'll do it.
That will work.
Go get him!
Go! Get him!
You have a criminal mind.
What effects will
tonight's events
Have on your future?
Oh, my god.
If you're trying to imply
That I've given
a moment's thought
To November's election...
oh, chief,
I wonder if the good people
of the press
Would be interested in
the contents of this tape?
Sir? Sir? Chief?
Chief, can you give us
a statement about that?
Oh, get a picture
of this! Quick! Quick!
Chief?
What's on that tape?
Can you tell us your name?
My name is waldo lake.
Ow!
Ooh! Aah!
Name, please.
Sterling.
Mrs. Andrew sterling.
I have a reservation.
Mrs. Sterling.
I think this is your stop.
Wait a minute.
Oh, um...
Here's your watch back.
Keep it.
Whoa.
Thanks, bro.
You're welcome...
Brother.
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.
Oh.
Oh, what was that for?
Oh, just glad to see you,
that's all.
And how was your first
night on the island?
Well, let me just say that
I think the house
is going to need
A little more work
than we thought.
Yeow!
Okay, Canada,
Here I come.
Yeah.
