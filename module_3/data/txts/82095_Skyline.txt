to find who you live with.
We can try there in 2 minutes.
You have no idea whether they kepp him alive.
I know you are scared, alright,
We are all scared...
But I am not burying my head in the sand.
Hoping it goes away.

What the hell is the matter with you?
- We will talk about it later.
- Yes, we will talk about that.
I- Still want to stay?
I don't want any of this.
They didn't see us
so we stay here and stay quiet..
For how long?
Theyare taking people
out there, fine and simple.
The further we get out of this city,
the better off we are.
He is right.
Jarrod.
If we can get to the boat
we have a chance!
- Yes, but we don't.
We have to...
We have to try..
We just get food and water.
Lets do this.
Alright come on.
Look, the sooner I get there,
the sooner the boat is ready to go.
Be careful.
- Come on, lets go.
- What..
What are you doing?
Driving, I know the way!
You just take your squat.
Candice... Candice.
Get in the car!
Terry, sorry.

Quickly... quickly ...quickly!
Hey! Come help me with this.
It's better than nothing, right?
Yeah if you say so.

You got to be strong.
Is everybody okay?
Are you hurt?
No...
I'm okay.
- What now?
- We stay here...
We keep watch and we pray
that someone comes.
He is right.
Someone will come.
I can't go on forever.
Right?
Sweety. It's best that we stay together.
I can't.
Smoke...
Given such circumstances,
I think smoke is more than reasonable.
Candice...
I'm pregnant, alright!
And I just thought that...
...That with all this stress...
Its okay.
I got to tell my mom.
Come on, boss. Lets the girls get some sleep.
You and I will keep watching.
Both of us?
They try that light stuff, we
got each others back.
I hate L.A.
I hadn't seen a soul all night.
Perhaps the worst is over.
Maybe not.
What do you think these things really are?
I do not know.
Does it even matter?
It just doesn't seems real.
Well, it is real.
You better wake up.
What's that supposed to mean?
The city isn't blinking light
We need to survive.
There's not going to be many of us left.
What do you see?
Somebody is fighting back.
What are you doing?
I want to see what's out there.
Turn that off, its too bright
No!
We can risk it.
SECOND DAY
Didn't you Sleep at all?
Is it getting worse?
- What?
- Mark on your skin!
When I looked in that light,
I couldn't stand for 10 minutes.
Who knows what it did to us...
...to our bodies.
You remember the first look when you saw it?
When it completely took over>
Somehow you... you still felt...
...powerful.
I still do.
Why don't you take a seat, relax?
Alright, I'll bite. What's your plan boss,
because I know you are dying to tell me.
Nothing to say?
- We sitting near the marinna for Chrissake...
- I noticed that.
There are hundreds of boats
way across the street.
We have been through all this.
Remind us how that was done
the last time?
We'll just go quietly this time.
And search every boat
till we find the key?
- We have to..
- Well plan Jarrod.
I can't believe you suggest that
after what happened.
So that was my fault?
I was practically begging,
but you wouldn't listen.
And you think
Terry wouldn't listen me?
Alrightl...
Let's say we make it
out of the building.
Across the marina
down the dock
We able to find a boat and
everything, then what?
- Get the hell out of the dock.
- For who?
Carolina, down the coast?
- Anywhere will be better than here!
- How do you know?
We are here.
We are alive.
What was that?
What do you see?
Hallelujah.
Come on... come on... come on.
Everybody get down!
Elaine?
It worked.
I hope we whipped it.
- Do you mind?
- By all means.
- Do you think more planes will come?
- Yes, now they know what to do.
What?
What is it?
They are not dead.
They are just really,
really pissed off.
Something is happening.
We have to close all these windows.
Come help me with this.
Get back over here!
I will find something.

Jarrod, what are you doing?
They'll get to you too.

We stay here and hole up... for good.
I agreed.
And I guess that decide everythig,

- No power..
- Yes, but you saw what's out there.
Yeah... but I'd rather make a run for it,
then stay at a 20 storey target.
Between those
Go..go..go make a stand.
- Let go off me!
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- You want to wait here.
