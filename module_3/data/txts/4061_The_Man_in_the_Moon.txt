# My whole life through
# For me
# I will spend my whole life through
# Loving you
# Just loving you
# When to summer springtime turns
# Loving you
# Loving you
# Makes no difference where I go
# Or what I may do
# You know that I'll always be
# Loving you
# Just you
# And
# If I'm seen with someone new
# Don't be blue
# Don't you be blue
# I'll be faithful
# I'll be true
# Always true
# True to you
# There is only one for me
# And you know who
# You know that I'll always be
# Loving you
- I love Elvis so much.
- You love everybody so much.
- I do not.
- You do too.
- No, I don't.
- OK. You don't.
Well, I don't.
Maureen, sometimes
you make me feel like such a baby.
You are a baby.
I wish I could be just like you.
- Don't talk silly.
- It's not silly.
You're the smartest girl in school.
You're so pretty it hurts.
Boys fall all over themselves when you
walk down the street. And I'm just a lump.
Come on. You're not a lump.
You've never been a lump.
You wouldn't know one if you fell over it.
Well, if I'm so damn perfect,
then why is my head so mixed up?
Mixed up about what?
Well, I mean, sometimes things
just don't make sense, and...
All of a sudden, I get scared.
Scared of what?
I don't know.
Are you all right, Maureen?
I don't know.
See, I don't know anything any more.
One minute all I think about is packing
my bags and catching the first bus.
The next minute I'm afraid that once I get
out in the world, it's gonna eat me alive.
That's dumb. You got a scholarship to
Duke and you're gonna live in the dorm.
Nothing's gonna eat you.
Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't
just stay here and get a job.
Or get married like everybody else.
Marry who?
Somebody. I don't know.
Billy Sanders?
Good Lord, no.
Do you remember when we were little
and Mama used to tell us
when things get all mixed up, all you
have to do is tell the man in the moon?
Yeah. You just had to keep on talkin' until
you were sure you'd told him everything...
so that he had all the pieces,
just like a puzzle.
And then he'd work out the puzzle
for you while you were asleep.
Yeah. But that was kids' stuff, Maureen.
We're too old for make-believe.
Yeah, I know.
Dani!
Dani!
Dani! Are you up yet?
Maureen! Get that child outta bed.
Dani. Come on, get up.
You're gonna be late for church.
I hate church!
All right, once your
baby brother gets here,
you women won't be able
to boss me around so much.
- I won't be so outnumbered.
- I won't be so pregnant.
- How do you feel?
- Not skinny.
Two or three weeks
you'll be back to normal.
Next time you have a baby, you let me
know how normal you feel afterward.
Can't you girls get in there
and give your mother a hand?
Maureen! These eggs are getting cold!
- Daddy going to his church again?
- Does he ever miss a Sunday?
Why does he call it church when it's not?
Because when he asked my daddy
if he could marry me,
my daddy said only if
he agreed to find the Lord.
And he says it's a lot easier
finding the Lord out fishin'
than in any church he's ever been to.
- I think he's right.
- Don't think you're gonna go with him.
Go upstairs. Brush your teeth. Wash
your face. You're goin' to Sunday school.
Morning, Maureen. Well, I declare.
You're just filling out all over, aren't you?
Morning, Abi. And how's the Trant family?
- Oh, just fine.
- Aw!
And, Danielle, you're just
shootin' up like a weed, aren't you?
Just like a weed. That's me.
One day that woman's gonna cut herself
on her own tongue and bleed to death.
Hello, Mrs Trant!
Let me get that for you.
Hi, Maureen. Hey there, little bit.
Didn't recognise you with a dress on.
You look great, Maureen.
Be by to pick you up about six o'clock?
That's right.
See you later, Mrs Trant.
That Billy Sanders thinks he's such a
hotshot. I don't see why you go with him.
- I don't go with him. I go out with him.
- Big difference.
Dani! Dani, you come back here!
Whenever it's time to make lunch
or do the dishes, she disappears.
Well, the way she does dishes,
I'd just as soon she'd be gone.
- Do any good?
- Oh, a little.
"A little" means you did fine.
Let me see what you got.
- Where's Dani?
- Off roamin' around somewhere.
She's supposed to be here helpin' out.
She's gettin' too big to be
runnin' around wild as a jack rabbit.
Used to be she was too little.
Now she's too big.
I guess she passed up "just right"
when nobody was lookin'.
Get outta here!
Who the hell do you think you are?
You get outta here!
- This is private property.
- Damn right. And you're trespassin'!
This is the Foster place. If your name
isn't Foster, you're trespassin'!
Well, it just so happens that it is.
- Prove it! Prove your name's Foster!
- I don't have to prove nothin'.
Nobody's lived here
as long as I can remember.
Well, they do now.
So get your butt outta here.
I'm not goin'.
If you're not out by the time
I count three, I'll drag you out!
You're lyin'.
One.
Two.
OK! OK! I'm goin'!
Turn around and close your eyes.
Do it, damn you!
What are you duckin'
behind the bushes for?
You ain't got nothin' to hide.
Danielle!
I thought I made it clear it's time you start
taking some responsibility around here.
Yes, sir.
I hope I don't have to bring it up again.
Yes, sir.
Your mama saved you some lunch.
Probably cold by now.
All right.
- Makin' a cake?
- Mm-hm. And ice cream.
- Must be having company.
- Old friends of your daddy's and mine.
Honey, go take a bath.
You smell like the pond.
# I will spend my whole life through
# Loving you
# Just loving you
# When to summer springtime turns
# Loving you
# Loving you
I, uh, hope I'm not interrupting anything.
I hope you're finally done
hogging the bathroom!
What time did you say that dance is over?
11 o'clock, sir.
It's how many miles from
the country club back here?
18.
So you should have
Maureen home by 11. 20, then?
- Yes, sir, about.
- Not "about".
Yes, sir. 11. 20.
- Hello, Mrs Trant. Maureen.
- I'm ready.
Not until you go inside
and get a jacket, you're not.
I don't have one that goes with this dress.
Then put on a different dress.
- You got a full tank of gas?
- Yes, sir.
No detours, no back roads, no liquor.
What time you got?
Well, 6. 13.
You're responsible for my daughter for
the next five hours and seven minutes.
Yes, sir, Mr Trant.
You don't have a thing to worry about.
Then neither will you.
Have a nice time.
She'll be fine.
- I remember his father at his age.
- What?
I said I remember his father at his age.
Mama, do I have to wear a skirt?
- Uh-huh.
- Who's so important?
Young lady, when your mama tells you to
do something, you don't ask her reasons.
- You smell good.
- You mean I don't stink any more?
They're here.
Boys, come back here! I warned you what
would happen if you two didn't behave.
Them two is as mean as snakes.
You haven't changed a bit.
Neither have you.
Come here to me, girl.
You was in this shape last time I saw you.
- I know.
- Matt, don't you know what causes this?
- Well...
- He's after that boy he's always wanted.
If you wanted a boy, you never
should have thrown me over for Abi.
Court, come here!
Let Matt and Abi look at you.
They ain't seen you
since you was in diapers.
Those two heathens over yonder,
those are my last efforts. Rob, say hello.
Dennis, quit scratchin' yourself.
This is Danielle. We call her Dani. And
that little bundle's Missy. Rules the roost.
Sure she does. Kids turned out
a lot prettier than you, Matt.
Now, are you really that shy,
or are you just puttin' on?
Court, come on down here. Quit moseyin'.
- Hello, Court.
- Mr Trant.
- Ma'am.
- Those are some fine-lookin' boys, Marie.
I hope to tell you.
Court, tie those two to a tree.
Well... Look at that corn.
I ain't got a thing in the ground.
- Well, it's corn, but it's short.
- No ears on that corn.
- This corn's store-bought.
- I'm so hungry I'd eat the kids!
- I think it might be about ready.
- Oh, good.
- Where's Maureen?
- Gone to a dance.
- With Will Sanders' son.
- Will Sanders? What's he up to?
- Runnin' a new shirt factory.
- And his big mouth, as usual.
Billy!
Billy!
Damn boy's deaf.
Billy!
Hey-hey, Billy!
Hey, boy. My God, Billy, you got yourself
one pretty little woman today.
I hope he didn't drive too fast.
We're glad you could join us, aren't we?
Maureen, it's so nice to see you.
- Thank you for inviting me.
- You're a sight for this old boy's eyes.
I can't see how Billy got so lucky. Come
in. Let's find ourselves somethin' to drink.
Let's grab some food, then we'll
jump in the car by ourselves.
I got dressed up to go to a dance,
and that's what I'll do.
You wanna go off, you can go by yourself.
Don't hit me! Don't hit me.
Boys, I want you to stay in the yard
where I can see you. And no tree-climbin'.
What goes up must come down.
I remember that much from school.
14 years?
- Has it really been that long?
- Mm-hm.
I had Dani about a month
after y'all moved off.
We were really sorry to hear about Beau.
I always knew
the damn pipeline would kill him.
Only I thought it would be
a little at a time, you know?
Anyway, it seemed like
the best thing for the boys and me
was to come back here to the farm.
You can always get
some sorta livin' outta good land.
That's it.
Ever wondered what would've happened
if Matt and Beau hadn't switched partners
at that dance 20 years ago?
I wondered.
But, hell, honey, you had a crush on Matt
from the time you was 12 years old.
13.
He was 17 years old.
He didn't know I was alive.
I thought I'd have to paint myself red
and set off dynamite to get his attention.
Well... you got him.
Yeah. I did.
Mama, this thing ain't workin'.
- What's wrong with it?
- I don't know.
- You need some more salt.
- Well, we're outta salt.
- Matt, we need some more rock salt.
- Daddy, I'll go with you.
- Court, could you run into town for me?
- Sure.
Dani'll show you where.
Dani?
Come on.
You don't have to come.
I can find the store by myself.
It's an awful big town.
Are you in the habit of goin'
where you're not wanted?
You always ugly to people you just met,
or are you practisin' to be a horse's butt?
- Little girls shouldn't talk nasty.
- I'm not a little girl. I'm 14.
- My goodness.
- You're not much older.
- 16?
- I'm 17.
My goodness.
You never give an inch, do you?
No.
Good. I like that. Well, are you comin'?
Hey, wait!
Thanks.
Hey, what is that?
# Only you
# Can make the darkness bright
Billy tells me you're leavin'
for Duke in a couple of weeks.
That's right.
I get up to Raleigh-Durham
once or twice a month on business.
- That's nice.
- I'll have look you up, show you around.
Well, I imagine they'll
keep me pretty busy studyin'.
I understand freshmen
really have to hit the books at Duke.
Now, you can't study all the time.
Everybody has to have a little fun.
I want you to understand I know college
can be a drain on the family's finances.
There's no need for a pretty girl
like you to go without anything.
Things get a little tight, I'll be there.
I just want you to know that.
Thank you. I'll manage just fine.
You won't mind if I borrow my date...
for a while... will you?
Not at all. Not at all. It's a pleasure.
Pleasure.
Sorry about my old man.
Let's just get out of here now.
Billy.
Billy, stop it! I mean it!
What is it with you, Maureen? You said
you wanted to leave the dance, we did.
- I thought you wanted us to be alone.
- I wanted to get away.
I was tired of being manhandled.
Can't you just hold me a little, Billy?
I don't think so, Maureen. I don't think
anybody could just hold you a little.
- What do you want?
- I don't know.
- I don't know either, and it's botherin' me.
- Me too.
I can't take it any more.
I can't either.
Do you feel there's something missing?
Something you've waited for all your life
- and you wonder if you'll ever have it?
- I'm feelin' like that right now.
I think love should be so beautiful.
And powerful.
I mean, I wanna be swept away by love.
- Billy. Billy, what are you doing?
- Maureen.
- I have to go home now.
- No, you don't. We have a whole hour.
No, I have to go now.
What are you tryin' to do to me?
Plenty of girls are dyin' to be in your spot.
Billy, I wanna go home!
If I take you home now, I won't be back.
All right.
It's probably for the best.
Good night, Mama. Good night, Daddy.
Good night.
# Well, that's all right, mama
# That's all right for you
# That's all right, mama
# Just any way you do it
# That's all right
# That's all right
# That's all right now, mama
# Any way you do
# Well, mama, she done told me
# Papa done told me too
# Son, that gal you're foolin' with,
she ain't no good for you
# But that's all right
# That's all right
# That's all right now, mama
# Any way you do
Rob! Dennis! Cut that jackassin' around
and get that stuff over here!
Anything for me?
Not much here but fliers and bills.
- Your friends'll get around to writin'.
- Yeah, sure, when they have time.
Now, you're not gonna be lonely for ever.
When school starts you'll be
makin' friends, playing football,
then you'll be the one
who doesn't have time to write.
- I don't think I'll be playin' much football.
- Oh, you'll get this place under control.
We do what we have to do.
You got too much of your daddy in you
to let this job be bigger than you are.
We're gonna have to get a tractor.
Well, maybe we can find
a second-hand one that'll run.
Can we afford it?
No. But we can't afford not to, either.
# That's all right
# That's all right
- I'm goin' to the library.
- That would be my guess.
Here.
What has come over her?
I don't know.
Yee-hah!
Hey!
Hey, yourself! Come on in!
Are you just gonna
stand there all day or what?
- Come up and jump with me.
- All right.
So you do own a bathing suit.
- You ready?
- Sure.
- Just hold on, OK?
- OK.
One. Two.
Three. Go!
- Maureen?
- Mm?
- What's it like to kiss a boy?
- Depends on the boy.
Are you talkin' about
anybody in particular?
I was just askin' a question. Can't
anybody ask a question around here?
For starters, you let him kiss you -
if you like him.
If you don't like him, you just tell him
that you're not that kind of a girl.
Well, what if you like him a lot?
Then you won't have to think about it.
It'll all come to you.
You're not tellin' me anything.
I need to know what to do.
OK.
Come here.
Come on.
First you'll have to kind of tilt your head
to one side so you won't bump noses.
OK.
Would you loosen up?
He's gonna think you're scared of him.
Not that much.
OK. Now, you kind of
open your mouth just a little...
Huh-uh!
You wanted to know how.
I am telling you how.
Look, practise on your hand, OK?
That's it. Just keep practisin'.
Well, what if I forget what to do?
Just do what you feel.
If I do what I feel I'll burst into a million
pieces and go flyin' out into space.
That sounds to me like
a good way not to get kissed twice.
Maureen, have you ever liked somebody
so much it almost made you sick?
Billy Sanders makes me sick
every time I look at him.
You know what I mean.
It's like my stomach ties up in knots.
And I can't breathe.
And sometimes I think
I'm gonna throw up.
Well, don't throw up, Dani.
Whatever you do, don't throw up.
Hey.
Here.
Thank you.
- It's nice of you.
- Well, I figured you'd be out here.
Yeah, I figure I'll be out here
every day for a long time.
- Sure is hot.
- Sure is.
Yeah. It's gonna get hotter, too.
Sure be nice to go for a swim.
I can't take off and go swimmin' with you.
I gotta make the most of the daylight.
Well, I can go swimmin' after dark.
- What are your folks gonna say?
- They won't say anything.
OK.
- How are things at the Murphy house?
- Well, we've finished framing up.
If we can get it blacked in before we get
the rain, the rest oughta go pretty smooth.
You'll do fine. The way it looks now, you'll
be praying for rain by the end of summer.
Come on, honey. Join us at the table.
OK!
Dani, put your napkin in your lap.
Court!
Court!
Aargh!
- Hey, kid.
- I'm not a kid.
Sure you are. You're my favourite kid
in the whole world, though.
Come on!
Hi.
Hello.
Come on!
Come on.
- Court, what's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
- Well, what did I do?
- You didn't do nothin'.
- Just tell me what I did wrong.
- I said you didn't do anything.
Have you ever been kissed before?
Sure. Lots of times.
I'll bet. You just almost got
more than kissed, little girl.
- I'm not a little girl.
- You are too, Dani.
And you don't know what you're doin'.
One day somebody's
gonna get your cherry.
But it's not gonna be me. Because I don't
think I'd like myself very much for it.
Dani?
Dani!
Dani!
Dani!
Dani!
Dani!
Dani!
Dani!
Mama!
Mama!
Dani!
Dani!
Mama!
Abigail?
Mama?
Oh, my God.
Abigail?
Ow!
Dani? Where's Dani?
Get my keys.
Where were you? What were you doing?
Call the hospital.
Tell them I'm on my way.
Get in the house!
Get inside the house now!
- How is she?
- I told you to go home.
- Doc?
- Are they set up in IC?
- Yes, Doctor.
- Somebody tell me somethin'.
- Go home, Matt. Please.
- Goddammit, Doc, tell me.
Abigail has a concussion.
She's got toxaemia.
Her body's not throwin' off
poisons, it's collectin' 'em!
There's not a damn thing you can do here
except get in the way! So go home!
I want you outta here now!
Daddy, don't!
Daddy!
Just stay here.
Mom asked me to bring this stuff by.
Some home-made soup and, uh,
yeast bread. And chocolate pie.
Hell, Mom's got the world beat
makin' chocolate pie.
- Where's everybody at?
- Hospital.
I'm real sorry about your mama.
I'm sorry about the way I acted, too.
About the way I said everything.
You don't have to be sorry.
Well, I thought we could still
talk sometime, you know.
If we can be friends
I can get you to understand.
I already understand.
Thanks for bringing the food over, Court.
That was a good supper Marie sent over.
Marie's boy bring it over?
Court?
Yes, sir.
He your swimming partner last night?
Yes, sir.
Did anything happen?
No.
Don't you mean "No, sir"?
No, sir. Nothing happened, sir.
I saw the way you looked last night.
That boy try anything with you?
No, sir.
No, siree. Not Court Foster.
Abi, I...
I...
I know.
I love you too.
This...
All of this is my fault.
If I hadn't been so set on
gettin' myself a son...
No, honey... You're not tryin' to take credit
for all this by yourself, are you?
Cos I seem to remember
helpin' out a little bit.
If I would've lost you, Abi...
Mama says I can come in tomorrow
and let Maureen stay home with Missy.
That's good.
Daddy...
I know you feel bad about
takin' the strap to me.
But I'm not mad or anything.
You were scared.
Worried about Mama and the baby.
I know that.
And I'm just awful sorry for what I did.
And for everything.
Hey, Court!
Hey!
Hey, yourself.
- Still wanna be friends?
- I'd still consider it.
Well, I was just wonderin' where
you do your best considerin'.
I don't have a suit.
I won't look.
Yee-hah!
Friends, OK?
- Friends.
- OK.
You can look now.
What makes you think I'd wanna do that?
- Well, you did in the water.
- I did not!
Could've fooled me.
Ow!
Court...
- I wanna know you.
- You do know me.
I wanna know you more.
I wanna know you all I can.
What do you wanna know?
I wanna know...
your hopes.
My hopes.
Well... Well, I hope your boobs will
get bigger and your butt will fill out.
Court!
Seems like it always
comes to this, doesn't it?
Have you kissed a lot of girls?
Not a whole lot.
I want you to be
the first boy to ever kiss me.
I thought you'd been kissed
so many times.
How was that?
Perfect.
Dani!
You like that boy of Marie's
a lot, don't you?
But you know you're not
old enough to date.
Yes, sir.
You wanna see Court, do it right.
Invite him over here to the house.
I'm not saying you can't go to the pond
any more or that you can't go with Court.
Just bring him around once in a while
where I can get a good look in his eyes.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Good to see you, Court.
Good to see you too, Mr Trant.
How's your mama?
She's fine. She got a job
at the shirt factory.
That's good.
She always was a good worker.
Yes, sir. Dani tells me that
your wife's doin' better.
That's right. Better every day.
Well, you kids have a nice time.
I'm going to see Abi.
Your sister'll be here shortly.
You can sit down if you like.
Sure.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing's the matter.
I'm lettin' you kiss me.
Aren't you supposed to let me try first?
Hi, there.
Hi.
Let me help you with those things.
Thank you. I'd appreciate that.
You must be Court.
I've been meaning to come by
to visit with your mother and say hi,
but I've been busy getting ready for
school that I didn't get around to it.
But I will do it, I promise.
Tell your mother that.
Sure. She'll be glad to see you.
Any time.
You can set these things down
and I can pick them up.
OK.
- You must be Maureen.
- I forgot to say that, didn't I?
Oh, you two can go back to whatever it is
you were doin'. I can handle this.
- Court, you wanna go walkin'?
- Why don't you two do that, and, uh...
I'll have dinner ready
by the time you get back.
Court, you're welcome to stay
for supper. Isn't he, Dani?
- Sure.
- Great.
That's fine with me. I can set the table.
Just show me where the things are.
I think we ought to have supper
in the dining room, don't you, Dani?
Whatever.
Court, I guess the last time
you and I saw each other,
- we were runnin' around in our diapers.
- I bet that was a sight.
Well, Mama says I used to beat you up
regularly with my sand pail.
I don't think I'd try that these days.
Everybody dig in.
I, uh, imagine that you work up quite an
appetite handlin' the farm all by yourself.
It's a lot of work.
I can't imagine havin' the guts
to tackle a job that big.
Yeah, well, sometimes I wonder if
I've bitten off more than I can chew.
I bet you'll do just fine.
- Are you OK?
- Sure.
I'm just fine.
Well, thanks for dinner.
You're welcome. It was nice meeting you.
Good night.
Oh. Good night, kid.
Court seems real nice.
He kiss you yet?
All the time.
Is he a good kisser?
He's all right.
Shit!
Hey.
I was just goin' down to the pond.
You wanna go?
I've got work up to my eyeballs
and no end in sight.
There's no one to tell me how to do it
or make sure I do it. It depends on me.
I just can't be there
every time you wanna go play.
- You don't have to be so hateful.
- I don't have time for this.
Sorry I took your time.
If you were just a little older
you could understand.
If I were just a little older
I could do everything, couldn't I, Court?
I love you, Court.
Don't. Don't love me now
when things are so mixed up.
I've got more than I can
say grace over right now.
- You look real nice.
- I think I'll go out for a little while.
- You goin' over to the Trants' again?
- I might.
I saw Maureen at the hospital today.
That girl sure is turnin' out.
You see Matt, you tell him to holler at me
if he needs anything, all right?
Yes, ma'am. OK, guys, let's go!
Get outta here. Come on.
I'll see you later, OK?
My, my, my!
Hey.
OK? Gonna go night-night.
Oh! There we go!
There we go.
Court!
Hello.
Hi.
Dani's at the hospital if you wanna
run on down and visit with her.
I don't think so.
It, uh, sure was a nice day.
Yeah.
Looks like it's gonna be a nice night, too.
- Yeah, looks like.
- Looks like.
I'll sure be glad when I can leave
this place and take you with me.
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep for a change?
I'll see you in the morning.
- You call me if anything happens.
- Yes, sir. I will.
Thanks.
So, do you like Elvis?
Sure. Who doesn't?
Dani absolutely adores him.
Well, she did until you came along.
You pretty well shot Elvis
outta the saddle.
I can't believe my little sister is
grown-up enough to have a boyfriend.
It's not quite exactly like that. I mean,
it's more like we're sort of buddies.
Just... real close buddies.
Does Dani know that?
Tried to tell her.
- You like her a lot?
- Well, of course I like her.
I mean, she's...
special.
Yeah, she, um...
She is that.
But what if I met someone else?
Someone special
in a different sort of way?
Someone...
She's my sister.
If you... need a friend,
I make a pretty good one.
A friend's not what I need right now.
You'd better go.
Hello?
Daddy! The hospital called.
Mama's havin' the baby.
All right. I'm on my way.
- I'm glad you're the one here with me.
- Me too, Mama.
- You're not frightened, are you?
- No, Mama.
- Good.
- Are you scared?
Not a bit.
I've done this before. Remember?
Lord, Court...
Hope you wanted a girl, Abigail.
Well, I know someone
who's gonna be mighty disappointed.
Matt had his heart set on a boy.
Want me to put it back?
God, no.
Court!
Hey, Court, where are you?
Court! We've got a girl!
She's the tiniest thing, and she's perfect
all over. Except she's bald-headed.
And I was there for the whole thing.
They didn't let me go in, but I was there.
It was beautiful.
Anyway, I couldn't wait
to tell you about the baby.
And I wanted to apologise
for the last time I saw you.
I was bein' unreasonable.
But when two people
really care about each other...
Well, when two people really care,
they try to understand things,
even when it's hard.
Don't you think so?
Yeah.
Sure.
Well, I'll see you, OK?
Yeah.
I never thought I could feel this way.
It's like I've been waiting for you
to come back and find me, and...
Now I'm afraid it'll all go away.
I'm not goin' anywhere.
He's unlocking it
and then he's gonna open it.
Come on, Missy.
Let's put the baby to bed.
OK. I got it.
Maureen?
Maureen?
Where could she have gotten off to?
She knew we'd be back about noon.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
I have to go.
- What are we gonna do?
- Don't think about that.
- We have to think about it.
- We don't have to think about it yet.
Yes, we do. I have to go.
I'll see you later...
Court, come on. I have to go.
Stop it. Please. Come on, you're gonna
make me late. I have to go.
- Dani, I need to talk to you.
- Maureen?
Maureen, can you get in here, please?
Where have you been? The baby's home.
All right, boys. I gotta take your brother
his lunch. He forgot it again.
Boy can't remember his name these days.
I want you to sit there, eat your lunch,
and no messin' around. You hear me?
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.
Court?
Court?
Court!
Baby!
Court?
Go away, Dani.
Go away, Dani. Go away!
Daddy!
- Daddy!
- Dani?
Daddy!
Daddy!
- Daddy!
- What's the matter, sweetie?
- What's the matter?
- It's Court.
- What?
- The tractor... Court...
Help!
Abi!
Abi!
No!
No. No.
- No.
- Honey.
No.
No.
Dani...
I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to hurt you, Dani.
I love you.
And I need us still to be close somehow.
I don't wanna be close
to you any more, Maureen.
I don't ever wanna be close to you again.
- Mama?
- Mm-hm?
I don't wanna be at church today.
Can I go with Daddy, please?
All right.
Mama, I loved him.
I don't know how to
stay alive without him.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
You know, Dani...
you and Maureen
are gonna be sisters for a long time.
Don't ask me to forgive her.
Because I can't.
You got a right to grieve, Dani.
You got a right to be hurt.
But if you get so wrapped up in your pain
you can't see anyone else's,
then you might just as well dig yourself
a hole and pull the dirt in on top of you,
because you're never gonna
be much use to yourself.
- Or anyone else.
- You don't know what she did.
I know enough.
I know hating your sister
is not gonna bring Court back.
Maureen's been good to you
all your days. Remember that.
She's hurting bad right now.
Hurting as much as you.
Maybe more.
Hey!
Hey, yourself!
You ready?
Just hold on, OK?
One. Two.
Three. Go!
It's OK.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Maureen?
Is it always gonna hurt this bad?
Mama says it won't.
I hope she's right.
I hope so.
You know...
sometimes... I think that nothing's
ever gonna make sense again.
Maybe life's not supposed to make sense.
Doesn't that scare you?
Yes, it does.
I wish I could still
talk to the man in the moon.
Don't you?
It would be nice.
Maureen?
What?
Will we always talk to each other?
Always.
