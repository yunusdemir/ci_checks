You don't have to go.
I got to, I got to
see a sick friend.
He is, he's sick.
Well, it wasn't
that good anyway.
Remind me not to get
on your bad side.
I was supposed to pick up,
some medicine for him.
I don't suppose
you could...
I don't suppose...
Bone.
Buy some vitamin E.
OK.
You're not interested
in the boat, are you?
No. I don't think I
can convince my husband.
OK.
Well, it's been better
for me, too.
Green Healey.
Healey.
A Green Healey.
My engine's had it.
Got to get it fixed.
Sorry, fella,
there goes your tip.
Shit!
Hey!
Son of a bitch!
Jesus Christ!
Fuck you, too!
I owe you a drink.
That's true, you do.
Maties.
Ishmael returneth?
HEY! HOW GOES YOUR SEARCH
FOR THAT FIENDISH LEVIATHAN
OF THE DEEP MOBY DICK?
OH, MOBY DICK?
ISN'T THAT
A SOCIAL DISEASE?
OH, GOD, IT'S
ONLY 1:30, ALEX.
YEAH, AND ALREADY
INTO THE B MATERIAL.
I ADMIT IT, RICH,
BUT, UH, GREAT ART...
GREAT ART DEMANDS
A GREAT AUDIENCE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
HEH! PERMIT ME
TO INTRODUCE TO YOU
ROSENCRANTZ AND
GUILDENSTERN HERE,
EMISSARIES FROM
THE DANISH COURT,
TREE SURGEONS
TO THE KING.
THEY EAT
PRUNE DANISH, RIGHT?
YEAH, RIGHT.
THAT'S MY LINE, RICH.
YEAH, AND THIS--
THIS IS OF COURSE,
UH, KARL MARX,
HAH, KARL MARX,
FORMER LEAD GUITAR
WITH THE BOSTON
SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA.
KARL.
AND LAST, BUT
CERTAINLY LEAST,
IS RASTUS,
THE COURT NIGGER.
WHY, DO I DETECT
SOME TENSION?
COME NOW, GENTLEMEN.
IT'S A SIMPLE MATTER
OF SEMANTICS.
WHAT ARE WE WHITE,
WELL-INTENTIONED
LIBERALS SUPPOSED
TO CALL YOU CATS
THESE DAYS, EH?
BLACKS? COLOREDS?
NEGROES? DARKIES?
JEEZ, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT WOULD YOU
CALL THEM, RICH?
I'D CALL THEM "SIR"
IF I WERE YOU.
THAT'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW,
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU CALLED THEM
THE NIGHT YOUR CAR
WAS STOLEN.
JUST WHAT WAS IT
THAT YOU CALLED THEM
THAT NIGHT?
ALEX...
ALEX?
ALEX!
I WOULDN'T PUT UP
WITH THAT IF I
WERE YOU, GUYS.
YOU MUST BE--
YOU MUST BE CRAZY, RICH.
CALLING THEM
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
UH, THE WAR, YOU KNOW...
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.
I WASN'T IN ANY WAR.
SEE.
UH, BUT IF HE CONVINCES
YOU HE ISN'T CRAZY,
DON'T SEND ME
THE PIECES, HUH?
MAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ALEX. THANK YOU, MAN.
HEY. HEY, FRIENDS,
DON'T MISS THIS.
YOU'RE WATCHING
A PRO IN ACTION.
RICHARD BONE,
DOING WHAT HE DOES BEST,
WALKING AWAY.
WHERE YOU GOING WITH
MY GODDAMN KEYS, HUH?
YOU FUCK!
THAT'S GOING
ON YOUR TAB, CUTTER!
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
CONSIDERING.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
IT'S A GIVEN.
THE WAY OF THE WORLD.
THINGS ARE OK...
CONSIDERING.
THAT GOOD, HUH?
DAMN.
ANY MINUTE NOW,
PRINCE CHARMING
WILL, UH--
RIDE BY ON HIS
GRAND WHITE CHARGER,
AND--TAKE ME IN HIS ARMS
AND CARRY ME AWAY.
MY CHARGER'S GOT
A BAD BATTERY,
BUT WILL I DO?
HELL, NO.
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
YOU'RE HOME AWFULLY
EARLY, AREN'T YOU?
COULDN'T YOU FIND
A MATRON WITH A TASTE
FOR GUTTER SQUALOR?
OR, UH, IS THAT
THE BATTERY TROUBLE
YOU WERE COMPLAINING OF?
I DON'T LIKE YOU
WHEN YOU'RE STONED.
HEY, RICH,
I DON'T LIKE YOU
WHEN I'M STRAIGHT.
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?
YOU DID HAVE A BAD NIGHT,
DIDN'T YOU?
NOT UNTIL NOW.
IS IT, UH,
IS IT SO BAD, RICH,
HAVING A PLACE
TO COME HOME TO,
WHEN YOU'VE GOT
NO PLACE TO GO?
POOR, RICHARD.
THE BOTTLE.
GOLDEN BOY.
THEY NEVER SAY NO
TO RICHARD.
REALLY MUST BE TOUGH
PLAYING SECOND FIDDLE
TO A ONE-EYED CRIPPLE.
HE'S NOT YOUR AVERAGE
ONE-EYED CRIPPLE.
IS THAT WHY YOU PUT UP
WITH HIS BULLSHIT,
SITTING AROUND WAITING
FOR THE RESURRECTION?
IT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?
YOU NEVER STAY IN ONE PLACE
LONG ENOUGH TO FIND OUT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
DOES THAT MEAN THAT
IF I'D BEEN AROUND
AT THE RIGHT TIME...
I WOULD HAVE MARRIED
ALEX ANYWAY.
I DON'T THINK SO.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.
BUT I DID.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM REAL HAPPY
WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE.
KENNY!
KENNY!
KENNY.
1, 2, 3!
HEY.

HE'S BUCKIN'
FOR SAINTHOOD.
WITHOUT ME,
HE AIN'T GOT
A PRAYER.
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME COFFEE?
NO. NO, THANKS.
I'D BETTER GET HOME.
SUSIE'S
PROBABLY WORRIED.
YEAH.
MUST HAVE KNOWN
YOU WERE BRINGING
HIM HOME.
NO, COMPLETELY
BY ACCIDENT.
HEY, RICHIE,
HOW DID WE DO
WITH THAT WOMAN?
SHE SEEMED PRETTY
DAMN INTERESTED
IN THE FORTY-FOOTER
THIS AFTERNOON?
I THINK SHE
HAD SOMETHING
A LOT SMALLER
IN MIND, GEORGE.
AH, TOO BAD.
HERE YOU GO.
GIVE ME
THAT BOTTLE.
YEAH, TAKE CARE
OF MY BOY ALEX.
GIVE ME THAT--
I'LL SEE YOU ALL

GAWD...
WHAT'LL IT BE,
ALEX, COFFEE OR SLEEP?
ANY OTHER CHOICES?
HEY, WHERE

EH, I'M GONNA
FINISH SLEEPING
ON THE BOAT.
COME ON, BONE.
HE WANTS TO, ALEX.
HA HA HA! HE DOESN'T
WANT TO GO. DO YOU?
YEAH, IT'S GETTING LATE.
I'M GONNA HIT IT.
UH, NO, IT'S NOT LATE.
IT'S EARLY.
HEY.
COME ON, STICK AROUND.
MO DOESN'T WANT
YOU TO GO. DO YOU?
YOU'RE JUST BEING
CRANKY, RIGHT?
HEY, COME ON.
WE'LL DO SOMETHING
TOGETHER.
HAVE BREAKFAST,
A CUP OF COFFEE.
GOOD IDEA, HUH?
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING ELSE
IN MIND, RIGHT?
YEAH?
YOU WANNA WATCH?
NAH. YOU WANT ME
TO WATCH.
YOU GUYS
ARE A LITTLE GRIM.
IT'S JUST
A LITTLE JOKE.
I GET IT.
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO WATCH. OK.
YOU GUYS ARE MAKING
ME VERY NERVOUS.
IF I DIDN'T
KNOW BETTER...
YEAH.
IS THERE
A RICHARD BONE HERE?
THAT'S ME.
DO YOU OWN A GREEN
HEALEY CONVERTIBLE?
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST COME IN?
YES, I DO, WHY?
OH, GOD!
OK, MR. BONE,
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE AUTOPSY REPORT.
CRUSHED TRACHEA,
FRACTURED SKULL,
SEMEN IN HER THROAT,
ON HER FACE.
17 YEARS OLD,
CHEERLEADER.
IT'S UGLY, MR. BONE.
DOWN IN L.A.
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME,
BUT WE DON'T GET
THE CREEPS UP HERE.
AND YOU, YOU
DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND I DIDN'T DO IT.
SO I THINK
I'M GOING GO,
ALL RIGHT?
SIT DOWN.
LOOK, I DIDN'T SEE
THE FACE, RIGHT?
I ONLY SAW THE BODY.
WHAT I SAW OF THE BODY
WAS A DARK SHAPE
WITH SUNGLASSES ON,
AND I CAN'T IDENTIFY
A FACE FOR YOU.
SEND IN MISS DURAN.
IS THAT HER MOTHER?
HER SISTER.
TELL HER WHAT YOU SAW.
SHIT.
THAT'S YOUR JOB.
IT'S YOUR STORY.
MISS DURAN, MR. BONE.
I'M SORRY.
HEY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
HEY, RICH, RICH, RICH,
YOU MADE THE BIG TIME.
HAVE A DRINK.
LOOK, SHOW HIM.
WELL, LOOK AT THAT.
"SUSPECT HELD
IN SLAYING."
OF COURSE, YOU KNOW
A WITNESS IS NOT NEARLY
AS EXCITING AS
A MURDERER BUT, UH...
I'M WILLING TO LET
BYGONES BE BYGONES.
WHAT'D YOU SEE?
I'VE BEEN PLAYING
THIS GAME FOR 6 HOURS.
COME ON, IT'S ME,
YOUR OLD BUDDY ALEX.
WHAT DID YOU SEE, MAN?
COME ON!
DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING,
ALL RIGHT?
YOU SAW A SILHOUETTE.
WE HEARD
THAT MUCH OUTSIDE.
THAT'S WHAT
I SAW EXACTLY.
WHAT'D HE LOOK LIKE?
WHAT'D GUY LOOK LIKE?
EXCUSE ME.
I WANT TO GO HOME.
I'M TIRED. LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.
HOME? WHAT HOME?
LET'S GO LOOK AT SOME
NAKED DANCING LADIES.
HOME? WHAT HOME?
LET'S GO LOOK AT SOME
NAKED DANCING LADIES.
HEY. SEE, RICH,
JUST WHAT I TOLD YOU.
TAKE YOUR MIND OFF
YOUR TRYING ORDEAL.
YOU MEAN YOU?
YEAH, COME ON,
WATCH THE PARADE.
LOOK, OUR GLORIOUS PAST,
THE MISSION OF, UH,
SANTA BARBARA.
HAPPY PADRES,
HAPPY INDIANS.
THE BLESSINGS
OF THE WHITE MAN.
WIPED OUT IN LESS
THAN 200 YEARS
BY DISEASE
AND FORCED LABOR.
YOU CAN STILL GET
ONE TO CLEAN UP
YOUR KITCHEN,
OR YOU KNOW,
PARK YOUR CAR.
THEY DIED
WITH CHRIST'S BLESSING.
HAPPY CORPSES
EACH AND EVERY ONE.
YOU'RE RIGHT, ALEX,
I NEED SOMETHING
FUN LIKE THIS.
HEY, THE BATON BRIGADE,
HEY!
JESUS CHRIST,
LOOK AT THAT ONE.
MY GOD, THEY'RE
MATURING EARLY.
HOLY SHIT, MAN.
WE WERE BORN TOO SOON.

WITH THOSE HARD, SMOOTH,
POLISHED, CHROME BATONS
THESE DAYS?
I BET YOU DO.
I BET YOU DO.
HEY, WE'VE GOTTA
FIND SOMEONE FOR MO.
HEY, MO, YOU COULD
GO OUT WITH THIS GUY.
LOOK AT THAT ONE, RICH.
YOU COULD GO
FOR THAT, HUH?
OR THAT ONE
OR THAT ONE...
OR THAT ONE.
THAT ONE AIN'T BAD.
YOU COULD PROBABLY
BOP ALL OF THEM.
HEY, LOOK AT THE SILVER
IN THAT HORSE'S MOUTH, HUH?
YOU THINK WE COULD
MUG A HORSE?
YOU THINK WE COULD
MUG A PALOMINO?
HEY! ARREST ME!
LOCK ME UP!
HEY, KID.

AND NOW, REPRESENTING
CORD INDUSTRIES...
HEY, NOW WE'RE
GETTING DOWN TO IT.
HARD CORE. HA HA HA!
BACKGROUND, BREEDING,
GENEALOGY,
SOCIOLOGY, RICH,
RICH, RICH. RICH!
FOR AN HONEST-TO-GOD
DYNASTY YOU NEED FAMILY.
WHAT D'YA SAY, MO?
THAT'S HIM!
WHAT?
THAT LOOKS LIKE THE GUY
I SAW AT THE TRASH CAN.
AND THE HONORARYPRESIDENTE
OF THE PARADE, J.J.CORD.
WHO? THAT GUY?
NO, THIS GUY
RIGHT HERE.
THAT GUY?
THIS GUY, RIGHT--
THAT'S THE GUY YOU SAW
AT THE TRASH CAN?
COME HERE! COME HERE!
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME VERY MUCH.
EXCUSE A GREAT DEAL.
I'M VERY SORRY
BUT EXCUSE ME.

EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.
'SCUSE ME, 'SCUSE ME,
'SCUSE ME...
RICH, COME HERE!
YOU MEAN HIM?
YOU MEAN HIM?
NO.
YOU MEANT IT.
THAT'S J.J. CORD.
HEY, ALEX,
RICHIE! HOW DO I LOOK?
HEY! YOU LOOK LIKE
A FAT MAN ON A HORSE,
GEORGIE.
CORD WAS BUSY
LAST NIGHT.
WHAT D'YA
MEAN CORD WAS BUSY?
HIS CAR WAS BURNED
AT THE MARINA.
WHAT WAS HE DOING
AT THE MARINA?
PAPER SAYS HE WAS
AT THE OIL CONFERENCE
AT THE EL ENCANTO.
DECIDED TO GO
FOR A DRIVE.
HE SAYS HE DOES IT
ALL THE TIME.
THAT'S
WHERE I SAW HIM.
WHAT?
I SAW HIM
AT THE EL ENCANTO.
I WAS THERE LAST NIGHT.
I SAW HIM AT THE PARADE,
AND THEN I MADE
THE CONNECTION.
PRETTY GOOD.
SO, WE CLEARED
THAT UP.
WHAT TIME DID YOU SAY
YOU LEFT THE EL ENCANTO?
COME ON,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
ALL NIGHT LONG WITH
PROFESSIONALS, ALEX.
ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY.
I APOLOGIZE.
TALK ABOUT YOUR LEG
OR SOMETHING.
GET YOUR HANDS OUT
OF THE GUACAMOLE, TOO!
CAN I ASK
ONE MORE QUESTION
BEFORE WE TALK
ABOUT MY LEG?
WHAT TIME DID YOU
LEAVE THE EL ENCANTO?
12:00. A LITTLE
AFTER 12:00.
NO KIDDING. THAT'S
FUNNY BECAUSE IT SAYS
HERE IN THE PAPER
THIS GUY WAS DRIVING
AROUND AROUND MIDNIGHT,
WENT DOWN TO THE YACHT
CLUB OR SOMETHING
TO LOOK AT HIS BOAT,
AND KAPLOOIE,
SOMEBODY JUST HAPPENED
TO BLOW UP HIS CAR.
WHAT SIZE CAR
DID YOU SAY YOU SAW?
WAIT A MINUTE.
IT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT BLOWING THE CAR UP.
THE CAR WAS BURNED.
THIS IS THE FIESTA,
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S BARS TRASHED
ALL THE TIME,
CARS ARE BLOWN UP
ALL THE TIME.
GIRLS GET KILLED
ALL THE TIME.
WHAT KIND OF CAR
DID YOU SAY YOU SAW?
BIG CAR.
LIKE A--
LIKE A CADILLAC, MAYBE?
I DON'T KNOW.
OH, OK, I'M SORRY, MAN.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT
AS RAIN AS USUAL.
THE ODDS AGAINST
OLD J.J. CORD BEING
A TRASH CAN KILLER
ARE ABSOLUTELY
OUT OF THE QUESTION--
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING,
RICH, TWO THINGS IN FACT.
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU SAID, "IT'S HIM."
NOW DID I GET
THAT QUOTE RIGHT?
NOT SIMILAR, SORT OF,
KIND OF LOOKS LIKE HIM
A LITTLE BIT.
YOU SAID, "IT'S HIM."
AND SECOND,
BIG NUMBER TWO, RICH.
HIS CAR TAKES IT
IN THE SHORTS
WITHIN 90 MINUTES
OF WHEN THE GIRL'S
BODY IS FOUND.
OF WHEN THE GIRL'S
BODY IS FOUND.
NOW, YOU DON'T
FIND THAT EVEN
REMOTELY INTRIGUING?
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT
ONE BIG PROBLEM?
WHAT'S THAT?
YOUR IMAGINATION.
JUST FACTS, RICH.
I MEAN IF--
I HAVEN'T EVEN BEGUN
TO LET MY IMAGINATION
LOOSE ON THIS ONE.
HE'S DRUNK.
WHAT MAKES YOU
SAY THAT?
MOTHERFUCKER!
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GIVE
THAT ANOTHER TRY.
YOU FUCKING MANIAC!
HEY!  HEY, HEY, HEY!
HEY.
IT WAS A--
IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE.
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE
THE GODDAMN THING.
AND BESIDES,
IT WAS IN MY DRIVEWAY.
YOU LYING BASTARD.
YOU CRAZY, CRIPPLED,
SON OF A BITCH!
HEY, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY, NOW.
DON'T HIT THAT
WITH ME, HUH?
COME ON, WHY DON'T YA--
WHY DON'T YA GO--
C'MON--
C'MON IN THE HOUSE--
COME ON IN THE HOUSE
AND HAVE A DRINK,
AND WE'LL TALK IT
OVER, OK, HUH?
HEY, YOU KNOW
MY OLD LADY,
SHE'S GOT A VIBRATOR
YOUR ASS'D LOVE.
WATCH IT!
COME ON,
LET'S GO INSIDE.
LET'S BE NEIGHBORLY.
HE'S CRAZY.
WATCH IT!
WATCH IT!
COME ON,
LET'S JUST CALL
THE POLICE.
NOW LOOK WHAT YOU DID.
YOU WOKE UP THE DOG.
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING, ALEX?
MINDING
MY OWN BUSINESS.
DOIN' A LITTLE
RESEARCH. HEH HEH!
OH, AND I CONDUCTED
A MODEST SOCIOLOGICAL
EXPERIMENT.
PICKED UP SEVERAL
HITCHHIKERS.
YEAH. AN AFRO-AMERICAN
HOMOSEXUAL
AND TWO MESTIZAS WITH
A DOMESTICATED SIMIAN.
HEH. THE BLACK CAT
AND THE TWO MEZ CHICKS
WEREN'T BAD,
BUT, UH, DON'T EVER
ORGY WITH A PET MONKEY.
THE LITTLE FUCKERS BITE.
YOU KNOW YOUR INSURANCE
HAS LAPSED.
THAT WILL BE
HIS PROBLEM.
YOUR LICENSE
HAS EXPIRED.
CAR RUNS FINE
WITHOUT ONE.
...BACKS IT RIGHT UP
WHERE YOU SEE IT NOW.
BACKS UP AGAIN,
PULLS THE CA--
THAT'S HIM.
GOOD EVENING,
OFFICER.
OFFICER.
MY NAME IS
ALEXANDER CUTTER.
I'M--
THIS IS MY CAR,
AND--
I'M REAL SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED, SIR.
JUST WHAT DID
HAPPEN, MR. CUTTER?
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU?
WELL, UH, I'M STILL
A LITTLE BIT SHAKY
ABOUT IT, BUT, UH,
WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
SEE, AS I WAS COMING
UP THE STREET HERE
IN MY CAR,
ANOTHER CAR FLASHED
BY ME WITH HIS BRIGHTS ON.
I WAS TURNING
INTO MY DRIVEWAY.
NOW, YOU SEE,
I KNOW MY DRIVEWAY
BY HEART.
I KIND OF HAVE TO,
AND, UH, JUST WHAMMO.
CAN I SEE
YOUR LICENSE?
YES, SIR.
WHAT ABOUT
SOME LANGUAGE?
LANGUAGE? LANGUAGE,
WHAT LANGUAGE?
JESUS!
I SIMPLY INVITED
THE MAN TO COME IN,
AND, UH, TO CALL YOU.
I MEAN TO CALM DOWN REALLY.
HE SEEMED PRETTY UPSET.
YOU KNOW
THIS LICENSE EXPIRED?
NEVER RAINS
BUT IT POURS.
AH, I DIDN'T
KNOW THAT, NO, SIR.
UH, YOU'LL HAVE
TO CITE ME FOR THAT.
YOU HAVE
TO DO YOUR DUTY.
AND DUTY IS SOMETHING
I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT.
I'VE CITED YOU
FOR LICENSE VIOLATION.
YOU TWO CAN
STRAIGHTEN IT OUT
WITH THE INSURANCE.
THANK YOU, OFFICER.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THIS BASTARD'S
A GODDAMN, CRAZY MENACE.
HE'S A FUCKING LOONY.
AREN'T YOU GONNA
DO SOMETHING?
WE'RE GONNA
TURN IN A REPORT.
THE HELL WITH THE REPORT.
WHAT ABOUT HIM?
WHAT ABOUT HIM?
LISTEN, YOU ASSHOLE, THIS--
HEY!
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
YOU HEARD ME,
YOU GODDAMN
STORM TROOPER.
I'M A TAXPAYER,
GODDAMIT!
SO AM I.
GOOD NIGHT,
OFFICER.
YOU GODDAMN
FASCIST PIGS!
YOU ASSHOLES!
FORGET IT, PAL.
TOYOTA'S A SHITTY CAR ANYWAY.
I'M A CRIPPLE.
WHAT KIND OF
RESEARCH ARE YOU
DOING INWHO'S WHO?
NOTHING SPECIAL.
JUST, AH,
THE SERIOUS STUFF,
CHECKING UP ON THE YOUNGER
GENERATION, YOU KNOW.
WHERE CHEERLEADERS
SPEND THE NIGHT,
THAT SORT OF THING.
WHERE DO THEY
SPEND THE NIGHT?
HMM. WOULDN'T
YOU LIKE TO KNOW,
YOU SLY DEVIL.
YOU KNOW, BONE,
DID YOU EVER CHECK OUT
GROUP THERAPY?
NO.
YOU OUGHT TO.
IT'S A NEW DISCO
NEAR THE OCEAN.
TAKE THAT GUY WITH YOU.
YEAH, AND?
AND...THAT'S WHERE
VICKI DURAN WAS
WHEN LAST SEEN.
BOOGYING THE NIGHT
AWAY WITH J.J.?
NOPE. J.J. WAS
ACROSS THE STREET
AT THE EL ENCANTO.
JUST LIKE YOU SAID.
WHICH YOU DIDN'T BUY.
I NEVER SAID THAT.
FACT IS THAT HE WAS
DEFINITELY THERE.
A LITTLE RECEPTION
FOR SOME OIL PEOPLE.
BUT, UH, J.J., OLD J.J.,
HE LEFT AROUND, UH, 11:00.
YEAH, 11:00.
WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT INFO, ALEX?
P.R. MAN AT THE HOTEL.
ALWAYS GLAD TO HELP OUT
A REPORTER FOR
THESUNSET MAGAZINE.
ALWAYS PLEASED TO HELP
SUCH HONORED GUESTS.
EVEN IF THEY ARE
A LITTLE SAUCED.
YEAH, SO GO ON.
WHAT ELSE HAPPENED?
THAT'S IT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"THAT'S IT?"
THAT'S IT.
WHAT THE HELL ELSE
DO YOU WANT?
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE FUCK
YOU'RE UP TO, MAN.
YOU KNOW, I CAN SEE
YOU REALLY GIVE A SHIT
IF I SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT
IN JAIL, HUH?
IT'S MY ASS, RIGHT?
WELL, THE WORLD
LACKS HEROES, RICH.
I DON'T WANT TO BE ONE.
IT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.
YOU NEVER WANTED
TO BE ONE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
YOU CAN STAY HERE.
ABSOLUTELY.
MI CASA ES SU CASA.
AND WE'LL TRY
TO HOLD IT DOWN IN HERE
FOR YOU, TOO.
UNLESS YOU WANT
TWO STRONG ARMS.
UNLESS YOU WANT
TWO STRONG ARMS.
YEAH. SLOW BUT STEADY
WINS THE RACE.
HEY, THERE HE IS,
GAZELLE BOY.
HAD TO DO IT, HUH?
YEAH. LIKE I SAID,

EH, PULLED A MUSCLE.

ALEX HAS BEEN
KEEPING ME BUSY.
YEAH, HE'S GOT
A GIFT FOR THAT.
HAVE YOU CHANGED
YOUR MIND?
CHANGED MY MIND?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
DECIDED THAT CORD

AN IDEA LIKE THAT?
HEY, ALEX.

I'LL SEE YOU THERE.
LET'S GO, GANG.
FREE EATS.
HEY, THIS IS A DEAD END.
ALEX KNOWS THAT.
HE SAID
YOU'D SAY THAT.
YEAH, I BET HE DID.
I DIDN'T SEE HIS FACE.
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK
AT ANY PICTURES.
A QUOTE
FROM J.J. CORD:
"I LIKE TO PICK UP
HITCHHIKERS,
"ESPECIALLY
YOUNG ONES.
I LIKE THEIR INPUT."
YOU KNOW, I WOULD GO
STRAIGHT TO THE D.A.
IT'S AN OPEN
AND SHUT CASE.
YOU'D PROBABLY GET
A MEDAL AND EVERYTHING.
THERE'S LOTS MORE.
GET UP, GO AHEAD,
READ IT, READ IT.
LET'S, UH, STRING
THIS DUDE UP, COME ON!
ALEX MADE
SOME PHONE CALLS,
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK?
AROUND MIDNIGHT,
AT A GAS STATION
ON THE COAST HIGHWAY,
SOME GUY BUYS
TWO GALLONS OF GAS,
IN JEEP CANS.
CANS, YEAH.
HE WEARS A FUNNY HAT
AND GLASSES.
A FUNNY HAT?
WAIT A MINUTE,
A FUNNY HAT?
THAT'S CORD.
THAT IS CORD!
ALEX, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
CORD TO ME, DOESN'T IT?
DOESN'T IT REALLY
SOUND LIKE CORD?
FUNNY HATS, HE'S ALWAYS
WEARING FUNNY HATS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.
HM. OK, LET ME TRY.
COME ON.
LOOK, RICH,
I'M, UH, I'M CORD.
AND I GOT A PINT
OF CHIVAS IN ME,
AND I'M WEAVING
ON HOME.
AND I SPOT THIS
SCRUMPTIOUS TEENYBOPPER.
AND I PULL OVER
AND I PICK HER UP,
INNOCENT THAT SHE IS,
SHE'S FLYING HIGH
ON ANGEL DUST, THAI STICK,
HECK, GOD KNOWS WHAT.
AND, UH, SHE GETS IN.
ONLY, UH, I'M DRUNK,
SO I'M HAVING SOME TROUBLE,
AND SHE STARTS TO LAUGH.
AND I'M OLD, AND I'M FAT,
AND I'M SWEATY.
AND, UH, SHE'S LAUGHING.
SHE'S LAUGHING,
AND SHE'S CHOKING,
AND SHE--SHE SPITS
MY PUNY CUM RIGHT
IN MY FACE.
THE FUCKING BITCH!
AND SHE AIN'T
LAUGHING ANYMORE.
BUT--
I'M J.J. CORD.
I TURNED A WILDCAT WELL
INTO A DYNASTY.
I DO NOT CRACK.
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
CLEAN UP A VERY MESSY CAR
AND GET RID OF A BODY.
IT'S FIESTA TIME.
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
BARS GET TRASHED,
CARS GET BURNED.
YEAH, SO?
SO, WE LET HIM KNOW
WE KNOW.
AH, HA HA!
THAT'S WONDERFUL.
THAT'S REALLY USING--
WHAT DID I MISS?
HEY, NOT MUCH.
ALEX IS JUST
MAKING A FEW JOKES
ABOUT YOUR BOSS.
CORD?
THIS ISN'T
THE BEST PLACE
TO MAKE JOKES
ABOUT MR. CORD.
THAT'S MRS. CORD
BEHIND ME.
GEORGIE'S
GOT A POINT.
LET'S WALK.
GET THE CHECK,
WILL YOU,
GEORGIE PORGIE?
HELLO, PATRICIA,
HOW ARE YOU?
HELLO, GEORGE.
WHO ARE YOUR FRIENDS?
OH, THAT'S, UH,

ONE OF MY SALESMEN
FROM THE MARINA.
OH, I SEE. CHARMING.
ENJOY YOUR LUNCH.
SO, WE PRETEND BLACKMAIL,
AND THEN WHEN HE PAYS,
WE GO TO THE POLICE.
WE GOT HIM.
OK, SO MAYBE
WE DON'T DO THAT.
ALEX ADMITTED HE MIGHT
TRY TO TALK US OUT OF THAT,
BUT WHATEVER,
IT'S UP TO ME--
BECAUSE SHE WAS
MY SISTER--
OK, LET ME SAY
SOMETHING FOR A SEC--
AND HE'S GOT TO PAY--
WAIT! LET ME SAY--
LET ME SAY SOMETHING,
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S SAY
YOUARERIGHT, OK?
YOU'RE NOT RIGHT.
LET'S SAY YOU ARE, THOUGH.
LOOK, YOU SHOULDN'T BE
WORRIED ABOUT BLACKMAIL,
SWEETHEART.
THAT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.
YOUR PROBLEM IS YOUR ASS
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE RIGHT
AND YOU MESS WITH THIS GUY,
YOU'RE GOING TO WIND UP
NAILED TO THE MAST
OF A LEAKY BOAT.
IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
I'D BE CAREFUL.
YOU KNOW,
VERY, VERY CAREFUL.
SURE.
SURE. THAT'S WHY
YOU GO SHOUTING OUT
YOUR WHOLE STORY
IN A RESTAURANT FULL
OF ALL CORD'S FRIENDS,
PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR HIM?
WELL, ACTUALLY, RICH,
YOU KNOW, UH, I'D SAY
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT OUGHT TO BE
VERY, VERY CAREFUL.
NOT US.
YOU ARE THE WITNESS,
REMEMBER?
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOUR FANTASY, MY ASS.
ALL RIGHT, SO WE'LL
BE MORE CAREFUL.
BUT HE CAN'T
GET AWAY WITH IT.
OH, NO, OF COURSE NOT.
THE FORCES OF GOOD.
A LITTLE BLACKMAIL,
A LITTLE PERJURY.
WE CAN ALL RETIRE
TO A TROPICAL ISLE
AND LIVE IN LUXURY.
HOLD IT, BONE!
YOU SANCTIMONIOUS BORE.
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU,
ANYWAY, HUH?
FASTEST DICK ON THE BEACH?
HELL, WHILE YOU
WERE GETTING LAID
IN THE IVY LEAGUE,
I WAS GETTING
MY ASS SHOT UP,
SO DON'T GIVE ME
ANY LECTURES ON MORALITY.
IN FACT, IN FACT, RICH,
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE.
DON'T--DON'T TELL ME,
LET ME GUESS.
THIS IS GOING TO
BE THE ONE
ABOUT HOW YOU
SEE LIFE
EXACTLY THE WAY
IT IS, RIGHT?
EVERYTHING'S A TOTAL
CROCK OF SHIT.
OR IS IT ABOUT
YOUR LEG?
OH, PLEASE,
NOT THE LEG. GOD.
I WATCHED THE WAR
ON TV JUST LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE, OK?
THOUGHT THE SAME
DAMN THINGS, YOU KNOW,
WHAT YOU THOUGHT
WHEN YOU SAW A PICTURE
OF A YOUNG WOMAN WITH A BABY
LYING FACE DOWN DEAD
IN A DITCH...
TWO GOOKS...
YOU HAD 3 REACTIONS, RICH,
SAME AS EVERYBODY ELSE.
THE FIRST ONE WAS REAL EASY:
"I HATE THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA."
YEAH...
YOU SEE THE SAME DAMN THING
THE NEXT DAY
AND YOU MOVE UP A NOTCH:
"THERE IS NO GOD."
YEAH.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU FINALLY SAY,
WHAT EVERYBODY FINALLY SAYS,
NO MATTER WHAT?
"I'M HUNGRY."
I'M HUNGRY, RICH.
I'M FUCKING STARVED.
SO, YOU PICK OUT
SOMEBODY TO BLACKMAIL.
I DIDN'T PICK HIM OUT,
YOU DID.
AND HE ISN'T SOMEBODY.
HE'S RESPONSIBLE.
FOR THE GIRL?
FOR EVERYTHING.
HIM AND ALL THE MOTHERFUCKERS
IN THE WORLD JUST LIKE HIM.
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.
SO LET'S BLOW UP AT&T.
YOU KNOW WHY THEY'RE
ALL THE SAME, RICH?
BECAUSE IT'S NEVER THEIR ASS
THAT'S ON THE LINE, NEVER.
IT'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY ELSE'S.
ALWAYS YOURS, MINE, OURS.
SO LEAVE OFF THE MORALITY, OK?
AND DON'T WRITE ME OFF
AS A MONEY-GRUBBING
BASTARD ALTOGETHER.
OK, BUT YOU DON'T
NEED ME.
DO IT YOURSELF.
THAT WAY YOU'D
ONLY HAVE TO SPLIT
THE MONEY TWO WAYS.
IT'S LIKE TRYING
TO SEDUCE A EUNUCH.
DID THEY SHOW YOU
VICKI'S BODY?
WELL, I JUST WONDERED,
'CAUSE I THOUGHT MAYBE
IF THEY HAD,
YOU'D BE WITH US ON THIS.
COULD BE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
SAILING.
YOU WANT TO COME, ALEX?
I'D LIKE TO.
MAYBE REVENGE
ISN'T THE ONLY THING
ON YOUR MIND.
HAVE FUN, GIRLS.
NOTHING REALLY COUNTS,
DOES IT?
NOT MUCH.
NOT EVEN MURDER.
YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK, RICHARD?
YOU KNOW...
VALERIE...
I THINK WE SHOULD DO
WHAT WE WANT TO DO.
I DIDN'T
SEE HIS FACE.
THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.
YOU DON'T WANT THIS.
WATCH YOUR BACK.
WHY? DON'T YOU?
BECAUSE IT'S GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.
THIS IS ALEX'S FANTASY.
YOU WANT TO LIVE IT OUT,
YOU DO IT WITH HIM,
NOT ME.
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
GETTING HURT, THAT'S ALL.
DON'T FLATTER
YOURSELF, BONE.
THEN SIT DOWN
AND FORGET ABOUT IT.
THAT SON OF A BIT--
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WHAT DO YOU CARE?
COME ON,
IF YOU WAIT A SECOND,
I'LL GIVE YOU A LIFT
BACK TO THE HOTEL.
NO THANKS,
I'D RATHER HITCHHIKE.
HEY, RITCHIE!
HEY! YOU GOT A MINUTE?
YEAH.
LOOK, RICH,
I WOULDN'T MIND
BEING IN YOUR SHOES
SOMETIMES,
BUT I THINK IN THE END
YOU'RE GONNA TIRE
OF ALL THIS DRIFTING.
NOW JUST STAY ON HERE.
PERMANENTLY.
TAKE THE CUSTOMERS OUT.
YOU LOOK GREAT ON THE DECK.
AND ANYTHING YOU SELL
YOU GET 5%.
AND WHAT DO YOU GET?
WITH YOU AROUND?
I GET, UH, TO KNOW
WHAT ALEX IS UP TO.
AND SPEAKING OF ALEX,
WHAT'S HE UP TO?
OH, ALEX...
HE FEELS THE WORLD'S
SHORT OF HEROS.
HE'S TRYING TO FILL
THE GAP.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM
LATELY, THOUGH, RICH.
I MEAN IT'S A LITTLE FUNNY,
BUT IT'S A LITTLE
MORE THAN THAT.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
HE SAID TO ME LAST WEEK?
HE SAID...
HE SAID HE WOULD SELL ME
THE NEXT 5 YEARS
OF HIS LIFE--
I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID--
FOR $50,000.
AND IN RETURN,
HE WOULDN'T DAMAGE
MY MERCHANDISE.
NOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
I TOLD HIM HE WAS CRAZY.
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
WHERE AM I GOING TO GET
THAT KIND OF MONEY?
AND FOR WHAT?
WELL, I BETTER
GET MY ASS IN GEAR.
UH, LOCK UP FOR ME,
WOULD YOU?
YEAH, SURE.
YOU SEE?
IT'S NOT SO BAD--
LITTLE RESPONSIBILITY.
JUST TAKE IT ONE STEP
AT A TIME.
SOONER OR LATER
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO MAKE A DECISION
ABOUT SOMETHING.
COME ON, TIGER,
LET'S GO HOME.
CALCUTTA,
BLACK HOLE SPEAKING.
IT'S ME.
YEAH, GREAT.
LISTEN,
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.
'BOUT WHAT?
CORD.
IT'S TOO LATE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I JUST SLASHED
MY WRIST.
WELL, TAPE IT.
"I WILL PHONE
YOUR OFFICE
"TO ARRANGE A PERSONAL
MEETING WITH YOU.
"TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.
RICHARD BONE, WITNESS."
BRILLIANT.
IT'S GODDAMNED BRILLIANT.
WE GOT THAT MOTHERFUCKER'S
BALLS IN A VISE.
WHAT A TEAM.
WHAT A GODDAMN TEAM, HUH?
NOT SINCE
THE 3 MUSKETEERS--
ONE FOR ALL,
AND ALL FOR ONE.
YOU WANT ME TO
SIGN THIS, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
IT'S MY MAIN SQUEEZE
BRINGING HOME THE BACON.
AIN'T SHE A SWELL GAL?
YOU WANT ME
TO SIGN THIS? TELL HER.
BLACKMAIL, HUH?
WHAT'S ALL THIS CRAP?
FOOD...REAL FOOD.
THIS, FOR INSTANCE,
IS A TOMATO.
FOOD, HUH?
YEAH, I REMEMBER FOOD.
PEOPLE USED TO
HAVE TO EAT IT
DURING THE PROHIBITION,
DIDN'T THEY?
OCCASIONALLY
FOR DAYS ON END.
YOU SERIOUS?
I, UH, LOST MY HEAD.
I WAS ON MY WAY
TO THE LIQUOR LOCKER,
AS USUAL, AND UH,
ALL OF A SUDDEN
I GOT AN OVERWHELMING
DESIRE TO EAT...
TO EAT REAL FOOD.
I COULDN'T STOP MYSELF.
YOU KNOW, VEGETABLE,
A PIECE OF MEAT.
I TRIED TO STOP MYSELF.
GOD KNOWS I DID, ALEX.
BUT THEN IT HAPPENED.
7-ELEVEN.
FOOD WILL NEVER
CATCH ON, DARLING.
MO...
I'LL TAKE
EVERYTHING BACK,
ALEX, I PROMISE.
WHY?
JUST TO
MAKE YOU HAPPY.
YOU REMEMBER
A CONVERSATION, UH,
RICH AND I HAD
ABOUT A MR. CORD?
WELL, OUR INVESTIGATION
HAS PROCEEDED APACE,
AS THEY SAY.
THINGS ARE BEGINNING
TO CRYSTALLIZE,
AND UH, WE ARE,
ALL 3 OF US--
RICH INCLUDED--AGREED.
IT WAS CORD WHO KILLED
VALERIE'S SISTER,
SO WE'RE GOING TO APPLY
A LITTLE PRESSURE.
AND IF HE PAYS,
WE'RE GOING TO BUST HIM.
'TELLING YOU,
IT WAS BONE'S IDEA. ME?
I WOULD HAVE WAITED.
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE GOING TO
BLACKMAIL J.J. CORD.
AND IF HE PAYS,
YOU'RE GOING TO
TURN HIM OVER TO THE COPS
WITH THE MONEY.
IS THAT RIGHT?
YOU GOT IT, KID.
THIS IS REALLY
INSULTING OF YOU, ALEX.
THIS IS MORE BULLSHIT
THAN I EXPECT,
EVEN FROM YOU IN A DAY.
YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE!
WHATEVER YOU SAY.
IT CAN WORK.
JUST LIKE HE SAID.
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT,
TO GET CORD AND THEN
JUST TURN IN THE MONEY.
GET FUCKED, SWEETIE!
DON'T BE ABUSIVE, MO.
ABUSIVE, ALEX?
HOW COULD ANYONE BE ABUSIVE
WITH THE 3 OF YOU?
A BAND OF WOULD-BE
EXTORTIONISTS, REALLY.
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.
HOLD IT JUST ONE
LITTLE MINUTE, HERE,
AND LET ME REFRESH YOUR
BURNT OUT LITTLE MEMORY.
VALERIE HERE DID
JUST LOSE HER SISTER,
YOU WITH ME SO FAR
OR YOU WANT A DRINK?
AND IF CORD KILLED HER,
VERY LIKELY,
IT SEEMS TO ME,
THAT WHATEVER WE DO
FALLS UNDER
THE HEADING OF JUSTICE.
JUSTICE--
PURE AND SIMPLE.
SIMPLE, ALEX, HARDLY PURE.
DISHONORABLE AND GUTLESS.
NOW YOU KNOW A LOT
ABOUT GUTS, DO YOU?
OH, YOU BET I DO.
GUTS IS HANGING AROUND
IN THIS PIGSTY
MONTH AFTER MONTH
WAITING FOR YOU TO
GET THE NERVE
TO START LIVING AGAIN,
AND WHAT DOES IT GET ME?
YOU AND YOUR FUCKING CRONIES
IN THE PLAYPEN PLANNING
A DUMB CRIME.
I DON'T SEE
MUCH USE IN THIS.
I'M GONNA GO.
YOU'RE A LITTLE
CHARMER, AREN'T YOU?
I MEAN YOUR SISTER'S WHAT,
TWO DAYS IN THE GROUND?
AND YOU'RE ALREADY PLANNING
HOW YOU'RE GONNA CASH IN?
WE'RE NOT
GONNA KEEP THE MONEY.
AH, SHIT,
GIMME A BREAK,
WILL YOU?
RICHARD, I'M GOING.
WAIT A MINUTE,
HOLD IT.
THIS WAS
YOUR IDEA, BONE,
TELLING LITTLE MAMA
ALL ABOUT IT.
SPEAK UP.
I GOT NOTHING
TO SAY, ALEX.
OF COURSE NOT.
HE'S GOT NOTHING TO SAY.
WHEN DOES HE EVER
HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?
OR WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YOU'RE NOT SOME SAINT
AVENGING THE SINS OF
THE EARTH, YOU KNOW, ALEX.
AND IF YOU ARE,
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?
OH, I KNOW.
I'M LIKE YOUR LEG.
YOUR LEG! SENDING
MESSAGES TO YOUR BRAIN,
AND THERE'S NOTHING
THERE ANYMORE.
I WOULDN'T.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH. YOU THINK
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME?
YOU MAKE IT
THE LAST, ALEX.
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
PARTNER.
I'M SORRY.
SOMEDAY IN TAHITI,
WE'LL LOOK BACK
ON THIS AND...
LAUGH.
THERE SHE BLOWS.
GONNA TO BE FINE,
JUST FINE.
RICH, DO YOUR THING.
THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.
I'M GONNA BE THE ONE
OUT THERE ALL ALONE.
ON POINT.
ONLY PLACE TO BE.
PURPLE HEART LAND.
THAT'S WHERE I WAS, RICH.
USED TO CALL THIS
"THE WET ASS HOUR."
USED TO CALL THIS
"THE WET ASS HOUR."
REALLY KNOW
HOW TO GIVE A GUY
CONFIDENCE, ALEX.
HEY, PAL, YOU'RE JUST
DELIVERING THE MAIL.
AND NEITHER RAIN,
NOR SLEET, NOR SNOW,
NOR GLOOM OF NIGHT...
CAN I HELP YOU?
YEAH.
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET
A FRIEND HERE.
HI, I'M HERE
TO SEE MR. CORD.
AND,
YOU'RE KIND OF SEXY.
DO YOU HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT?
NO, NO. I DON'T HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT.
BUT I HAVE TO SEE HIM.
IT'S A MATTER OF CRUCIAL
CONCERN TO MR. CORD.
IT CONCERNS THE NIGHT
HIS CAR WAS BURNED.
I'M SURE HE'D BE VERY,
VERY GLAD TO HEAR FROM ME,
BUT IT HAS TO BE
FROM ME, PERSONALLY.
WELL, I DON'T HAVE THAT
AUTHORITY. I'M SORRY.
I'LL HAVE TO GO
TO MY SUPERIOR,
MISS IRONCROTCH.
YEAH? NO KIDDING.
WELL, YOU, UH...
YOU KNOW, YOU DO WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO, MISS.
I MEAN, IF I WERE YOU,
I'D GO AS HIGH AS I CAN.
I'M SURE MR. CORD WOULD BE
VERY UNHAPPY IF TOO MANY
PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT THIS.
YOU CAN SKIP RIGHT PAST
IRONCROTCH AND GO ONTO
MR. STEP'N FETCHIT.
THAT'S AS FAR AS
HE'S GOING TO GET.
COME ON, LET'S GO.
OUT OF SIGHT, MAN.
WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, OK. I PRESSED
THE DUDE, RIGHT?
I TOLD HIM, I SAID, LOOK,
THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL,
VERY IMPORTANT LETTER.
I TOLD HIM THAT CORD'S
GOING TO HAVE HIS ASS
IF ANYBODY ELSE GOT A HOLD
OF THE LETTER, RIGHT?
THAT'S IT.
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY IT.
NOW, IT'S UP TO HIM.
YOU DID IT.
WELL, I GOT TO CALL
HIM BACK AT 1:00, BUT...
HE DID IT!
BONEHEAD DID IT!
YOU DID IT, BONER,
YOU DID IT.
OH, THOSE BABY BLUES.
YOU DID IT.
GOING TO NAIL THAT GUY
WITH THE HUGE HEAD
AND THE LITTLE TEENY-WEENY,
TEENY-WEENY, TEENY-WEENY.
WE DID IT!
?? IT'S A GRAND OLD FLAG,
IT'S A HIGH-FLYING FLAG ??
?? WHEREVER WITH
GRACE MAY YOU WAVE ??
?? IT'S THE EMBLEM OF
THE LAND I LOVE ??
?? THE HOME OF THE FREE
AND THE BRAVE...??
YAH. ONE MORE TIME.
GOLLY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
OH, I TRY NOT TO.
I MEAN, ABOUT ME...
OR ABOUT
WHAT MO SAID.
VICKI ONLY BEING
DEAD A FEW DAYS AND
ME TRYING TO CASH IN.
WE ALL HAVE OUR REASONS.
THAT'S MINE, RIGHT?
RICH, RICH. IT'S
TIME TO CALL CORD.
ONE SEC.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ONE SEC?
CALL HIMNOW.
HEY, I'M GOING
TO WIN A DOLL HERE.
YEAH? YOU'VE BEEN
TRYING TO WIN A DOLL
FOR HALF AN HOUR. COME ON.
PISS ME OFF, BONE.
GIVE HIM
HIS GODDAMN DOLL.
GIVE THIS CLOWN ENOUGH
TO COVER ANY DAMAGE.
HE'LL GET IT BACK IN
A COUPLE OF HOURS. COME ON.
YEAH.
HE DIDN'T, UH?
AH, I SEE.
BUT HE GAVE HIM
THE MESSAGE?
NO, I UNDERSTAND.
FINE. THANK YOU.
NO.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
NO DICE, MAN.
WHAT?
NO DICE. HE GAVE
CORD THE MESSAGE.
PRICE GAVE IT TO HIM
PERSONALLY, AND THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL THERE IS.
WHICH IS NOTHING.
NO RESPONSE.
THAT MURDERING BASTARD.
THE MURDERING BASTARD,
THAT'S WHAT.
ARE YOU FUCKED?
SORRY, ALEX. THERE'S
NO SALE, YOU KNOW.
HECK, GODDAMN IT.
THAT FUCKING,
MURDERING BASTARD!
GODDAMN IT!
YOU FUCKING SHITTING ME?
GOD, GODDAMN FUCK!
FUCKING, FUCK!
SHIT. FUCK IT!
GODDAMN.
I DIDN'T DELIVER
THE LETTER, ALEX.
WHAT?
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE
THE GAME'S OVER.
YOU MAY BE SUICIDAL.
I'M NOT.
YEAH. IT TAKES
TOO MUCH COMMITMENT.
YEAH. YOU TICKLE ME, BONE.
YEAH, YOU KNOW.
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO HANG AROUND ANYMORE,
AND YOU WANT TO GO HOME
WHERE THE HEART IS, GO.
I'M SURE MO'S
VERY LONELY, TOO.
ME, I'M GOING TO--I'M GOING
TO NAIL THE BASTARD.
COME ON, VAL.
IT'S YOU AND ME.
MO?
HELLO, RICH.
ENJOY YOURSELF?
YES, I DID.
WELL, THEY'RE
PRETTY GOOD,
WHAT THERE IS OF THEM.
UH, I'M AN EYES MAN.
BLOODSHOT?
YEAH. MOST OF THE TIME.
WHERE'S ALEX?
HE'S FIGHTING
THE GOOD FIGHT.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ME? I CHICKENED OUT.
AMAZING. A MOMENT OF
WEAKNESS OR SANITY?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING
THAT WHEN NOTHING HAPPENED...
THIS SCHEME WOULD JUST
DISSOLVE OR SOMETHING,
I DON'T KNOW.
AND VALERIE?
DID SHE
CHICKEN OUT, TOO?
NO, NO.
NO. SHE'S HANGING IN
TILL THE BITTER END.
HELLO?
HI...FINE.
WONDERFUL.
HEY LOOK, MAN,
I WISH YOU ALL
THE LUCK, YOU KNOW?
YOU DID?
WELL, THAT'S
TERRIFIC.
HE'S GOING
TO SEND YOU
A MESSAGE, UH-HUH.
THANK YOU, ALEX.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YES, I'LL TELL HER.
OK. WE WON'T
EXPECT YOU.
BYE-BYE.
WELL, HE'S DONE IT.
GAVE CORD THE LETTER.
HE'S ALSO FORGIVEN
ME OF MY SINS,
AND HE WANTED ME
TO TELL YOU TO BE SURE
TO BE EXTRA NICE
BECAUSE MY EGO
HAS BEEN SO BADLY
BRUISED OF LATE. AND--
FRANKLY, MY DEAR,
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.
WELL, RICH.
SANITY IS POSITIVELY...
TAKING OVER.
IT'S AN OFF DAY.
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE
THE DAY OFF?
ANYTHING SPECIAL
IN MIND?
PROBABLY.
BUT WE COULD START
WITH THE OLD STAND-BYS,
YOU KNOW,
LOAF OF BREAD,
JUG OF WINE--
CHEESE.
CHEESE.
WE'RE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
ONE NIGHT WON'T CHANGE THE WAY ?
YOUR EYES LOOK
BACK LIKE PHOTOGRAPHS
OF OTHERS I CAN SEE ??
WE'RE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
ONE NIGHT CAN'T TAKE AWAY ??
FACES OF THE LOVERS THAT
YOU SEE ENGRAVED ON ME ??
WE'RE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT IT CAN'T BE...??
DON'T BOTHER, RICH.
YOU'D ONLY BE DISAPPOINTED.
AND I'D LOSE A FRIEND.
I DON'T THINK SO.
LET'S FIND OUT.
YOU REALLY ARE A SLAVE
TO IT, AREN'T YOU?
GEE, MO, IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO, THAT'S FINE,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO KNOCK THE FEELING,
YOU KNOW?
RIGHT.
SORRY.
IT'S A BAD HABIT.
I GUESS WE REALLY DON'T HAVE
THAT MUCH TO LOSE, DO WE?
WAIT A MINUTE.
I LOVE YOU.
RICH, CAN I ASK
YOU A QUESTION?
YEAH. SURE.
DO YOU STILL MEAN
ANY OF WHAT YOU SAID?
YEAH. I THINK SO.
HOW MUCH?
I SAID I LOVE YOU.
RELAX, RICH.
THE RICHARD BONE
FAN CLUB IS NOW
COMPLETE.
NO MORE HOLDOUTS.
YES?
IS THERE
SOMETHING ELSE?
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I DO, RICH?
SOMETIMES...
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE NIGHT
ALONE AND I CAN'T SLEEP...
I HAVE TO GO
AND LOOK AND SEE
IF I'M STILL HERE.
MO, I'LL BE HERE.
I JUST
STAND THERE...
LOOKING.
AND I WONDER...
I REALLY WONDER
IF I CARE.
OR IF I'D EVER
REALLY CARED.
OR IF--OR IF ALL I...
EVER DO IS PRETEND.
IT'S--NO, RICH,
IT'S NOT YOU.
IT'S ME.
I'M GOING TO STAY.
WOULD YOU?
JUST TONIGHT,
YOU KNOW.
PLEASE.
COME ON.
NEVER MET A MAN SO EAGER
TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF
ON THE FIELD OF COMBAT.
RICHIE? RICHARD?
YEAH, I'M DOWN HERE, GEORGE.
WHERE'S ALEX?
IN L.A. WHY?
WHAT HAPPENED?
DALE, YOU DONE IN THERE?
OPEN IT.
MO.
YOU OK?
I'VE BEEN BETTER.
SUSIE WANTS YOU TO HAVE
THE GUEST HOUSE FOR AS
LONG AS YOU NEED IT.
COME ON, GEORGE.
YOU AND SUSIE?
YEAH.
LET'S GO TO THE POLO
CLUB, GET A DRINK.
I DON'T DRINK.
YOU KNOW, THE ROUTINE
GRIND DRIVES ME TO DRINK.
TRAGEDY I TAKE STRAIGHT.
I NEED A DRINK.
WHY DON'T
YOU GO PLAY, GEORGE?
I'LL STAY HERE WITH YOU.
THERE'S ALWAYS A GAME.
I'D KIND OF LIKE
TO WATCH YOU PLAY.
I'M GOING TO SCORE
ONE FOR YOU, ALEX.
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING
TOO MANY BABE RUTH
MOVIES, GEORGE.
I GOT IT.
I'M COMING UP ON THE OUTSIDE.
GET IN HERE, SUPPORT ME.
IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY HAT,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?
LIKE THE KIND THE GAS
STATION ATTENDANT SAID
THE GUY WITH JEEP CANS WORE.
GEORGE SWANSON
ENTERS THE GAME.
WHAT? YOU THINK
CORD KILLED MO?
I KNOW HE DID.
AND SO DO YOU.
BECAUSE OF THE
BLACKMAIL LETTER?
THE LETTER!
WHAT A CROCK.
JESUS, I WIN THE PRIZE.
ALEXANDER CUTTER
UNDERESTIMATES THE RICH.
I WAS ONE.
IT'S SIMPLE, RICH.
IT'S REAL EASY.
YOUR PICTURE WAS IN
THE PAPER, REMEMBER?
PAGE ONE.
HE KNEW WHO YOU WERE
FROM THE FIRST,
AND NOT ONLY YOU BUT ME,
VALERIE, AND MO.
YOU THINK WE HAVEN'T
BEEN WATCHED?
HE MAY BE SCARED,
BUT HE'S SMART...
AND POWERFUL.
HE HAD YOUR BAPTISM PAPERS
WITHIN THE FIRST HALF-HOUR,
A LIST OF YOUR FRIENDS,
AND EVERY BROAD YOU'VE
RACKED FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS.
YOU NEVER HAD TO DELIVER
ANY BLACKMAIL LETTER.
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS
GO TO THE CORD BUILDING.
SO, WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO DO?
IT'S NOT A QUESTION
OF WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
IT'S A QUESTION OF WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH
THE TIME YOU'VE GOT LEFT.
THEY WEREN'T AFTER MO.
THEY WERE AFTER YOU.
HE JUST DIDN'T SEE YOU LEAVE.
THE BALL IS IN PLAY.
NO, HUH?
THAT NIGHT I LEFT...
SHE WAS PRETTY
DEPRESSED.
YOU KNOW, THINGS GOT
KIND OF HEAVY.
YOU'RE--YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU ARE TRULY UNBELIEVABLE.
WHAT A MONSTER FUCKING EGO!
I MEAN, YOU WALK OUT
ON A GIRL, AND WHAT
CHOICE HAS SHE GOT?
SHE JUST HEADS STRAIGHT
FOR THE OVEN, RIGHT?
I MEAN, WHAT'S LEFT HER?
NICE, RICH. REALLY NICE.
NICE.
WHEN YOU GOING TO WALK?
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO TRY.
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO TRY
TO DO YOUR LITTLE WALK.
RICHARD BONE ALWAYS
DOES HIS FAMOUS WALK.
WALK!
WALK.
WALK.
WALK.
WALK, WALK, WALK.
WALK! WALK! WALK!
WALK.
WALK.
ALEX.
WALK. WALK.
ALEX!
YOU KILLED MY WIFEY.
YOU...
THEY'RE GONNA
CRUCIFY YOU!
YOU'RE GONNA PAY!
YOU'RE GONNA--YOU...
YOU'RE GONNA PAY!
WALK! WALK! WALK!
WALK!
COME ON, ALEX.
PERMISSION
TO COME ABOARD.
COME ON IN, RICH.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
YOU AND ALEX.
I MEAN, HASSLING GUYS AT
THE LOCAL PUB IS ONE THING,
BUT J.J. CORD?
THAT'S CRAZY.
EVEN WITH MO AND ALL,
HE IS WAY OVERBOARD.
HE'S PRACTICALLY BARRICADED
HIMSELF IN MY GUESTHOUSE.
WON'T COME OUT,
WON'T LET ME IN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE DOES FOR FOOD.
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT
CORD MURDERING SOMEBODY?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW ALEX.
HE PICKED UP
ON SOMETHING,
WON'T LET IT GO.
WELL, HE'D BETTER.
SOUNDS A LITTLE FINAL,
GEORGE. WHY?
SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT YESTERDAY, HUH?
LOOK. YOU KNOW, I FEEL
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALEX
IN A LOT OF WAYS.
WHEN MY MOTHER DIED,
HIS MOM TOOK ME IN
LIKE A SECOND SON.
I KNOW.
CORD HAS HELPED ME OUT, TOO.
HE SET ME UP.
BUT HE'S IN
A WHOLE OTHER LEAGUE.
THEY DON'T PLAY GAMES.
THEY PLAY FOR KEEPS.
OK.
HE PRESSES ON THIS ONE,
AND HE IS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.
NOW, I HAVE A LOT
ON MY MIND, SO I KNOW
YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.
I MEAN, IF YOU NEED
ANYTHING, I'M HERE.
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE HIM.
HEY...
ALEX.
PRIVATE R. BONE
REPORTING TO GENERAL
GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUTTER.
ALL QUIET ON
THE WESTERN FRONT, SIR!
I THINK TOMORROW
IS OUR BEST BET.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BITE.
FOR WHAT?
FOR A MEETING WITH CORD.
YOU'VE GOT DOWN
HERE HE'S HAVING
A PARTY TOMORROW.
YEAH.
I FIGURE I'D LIKE TO HAVE
AS MANY PEOPLE AROUND
AS POSSIBLE, YOU KNOW.
I HEAR HE'S DANGEROUS.
YOU'VE BEEN
INVITED, HUH?
OF COURSE I'VE BEEN INVITED.
I WOULDN'T GO WITHOUT
AN INVITATION.
WE'REINVITED.
THIS IS GEORGE'S.
I UNDERSTAND
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS,
BUT I'D LIKE YOU THERE.
BUT IT'S UP TO YOU.
GEORGE IS PRETTY
FRIGHTENED.
SO AM I.
FOOL NOT TO BE.
STILL, IT'S UP TO YOU.
I MEAN,
HE'S SCARED, MAN.
YOU KNOW WHY?
CORD KILLED HIS FATHER.
YEAH, YEAH. I KNOW.
ALEX IS REALLY
AROUND THE BEND, HUH?
THIS YOU CAN CHECK OUT
WITH GEORGIE.
YOU SEE, IN THE THIRTIES,
HIS OLD MAN USED TO OWN
THE ENTIRE MARINA.
CORD WAS ALWAYS TRYING
TO BUY IT FROM HIM,
BUT NO SALE.
OLD MAN SWANSON WAS
ONE TOUGH SON OF A BITCH.
HE WAS A GREAT GUY.
ANYWAY, SOMEBODY
OFFED HIS HOLD LADY.
THAT BROKE HIM.
HE WENT AFTER CORD.
UNFORTUNATELY,
HE FOUND HIM.
HE GOT BEAT UP REAL BAD.
ENDED UP
A VEGETABLE AND DIED.
GEORGIE WAS JUST A KID.
HE WAS A KID,
BUT HE KNEW SOMETHING.
AND ALL THE SUDDEN, CORD
STARTED PAYING EXTRA SPECIAL
ATTENTION TO HIM, YOU KNOW?
PUT HIM THROUGH COLLEGE,
PUT HIM UP IN THE MARINA.
TRYING TO HELP THE POOR KID.
SURE. AND KEEP REAL
CLOSE TABS ON HIM, TOO.
SO, YEAH, GEORGIE'S SCARED.
HE'S SCARED SHITLESS.
HAS BEEN HIS WHOLE LIFE.
IT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH GEORGIE.
IT'S GOT SOMETHING
TO DO WITH US.
SO, LIKE I SAY, RICH...
IT'S UP TO YOU.
YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS, ALEX?
NOT REALLY.
NO, I'M NOT.
THEN WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE DOING HERE?
CORD SENT US A MESSAGE.
HE KILLED MY WIFE.
LOOK...
THAT LAST NIGHT WITH MO,
SHE WAS DEPRESSED.
I MEAN, SHE WAS
REALLY DEPRESSED.
SO, WHO ISN'T?
YOU TAKE IT PRETTY GOOD,
DON'T YOU?
WHICH PART?
THE DYING PART
OR THE SCREWING PART?
ALEX, WHAT'S THIS
GOING TO PROVE?
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S GOING
TO CHANGE ANYTHING.
IT'S NOT GOING
TO BRING HER BACK,
IT'S NOT GOING
TO TAKE AWAY OUR GUILT.
IT'S NOT GOING
TO MAKE YOU WHOLE AGAIN,
YOU KNOW THAT.
NOTHING'S EVER
GOING TO DO THAT.
I,...
I GOTTA GO, I GO.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, KILL HIM?
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
IF YOU WANT TO WALK,
I UNDERSTAND.
I THINK MO
WOULD LIKE THIS.
SHE ALWAYS LIKE
TO PLAY DRESS UP.
EXCUSE ME, FELLAS, UH...
OH! EXCUSE ME!
EXCUSE ME.
I'M MRS. CORD.
ALEXANDER RICHARD.
HOW DO YOU DO?
WITH SUCH A CHARMING
HOSTESS, MARVELOUSLY.
YES. WELL, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO,
PLEASE LET ME KNOW.
OK.
BONE.
YOU SEEN CORD?
NOT YET.
WELL, SAW
HIS WIFE IN THERE.
SHE GAVE ME
A REAL WEIRD LOOK.
THEN HE KNOWS
WE'RE HERE.
LET'S GO FIND
THE MURDERING
BASTARD.
GIVE ME THE GUN, HUH?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
ALEX, YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS.
GIVE ME THE GUN.
IT ISN'T LOADED.
LET'S, UH, MINGLE.
HOWDY, UH, JUST PUT
YOUR ARMS AROUND ME.
THANK YOU.
I'M TRYING
TO AVOID SOMEBODY.
JUST LAUGH LIKE YOU'RE...
I'M SUPPOSED
TO LAUGH AT YOU?
JUST LOOK AT ME
AND KISS ME.
MY GOD--
HEY, GREAT.
I'M RICHARD ALEXANDER WITH
C.C.& MUTUAL INVESTMENT.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
WELL, I DON'T USUALLY
DO THINGS LIKE THIS
AT PARTIES.
IT'S BEEN PLEASANT
CHIT-CHATTING WITH YOU,
THANK YOU.
Bone,
Alex.
Alex, what are
you doing?
I'm looking for Cord.
I know you're
looking for Cord.
Look, will
you wait for me?
Come on.
Wait.
Come on, let's look.
Let's stick
with the crowd.
You stick out
too much.
We already
checked out the crowd.
He isn't in the crowd.
Come on, will you?
I know every room
in this house.
WHY DON'T WE ALL
GO OUT INTO THE GARDEN?
I'VE GOT THE MOST
MAGNIFICENT ROSES YOU'VE
EVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE.
Hey! Let's
stay with the crowd,
where you don't
stand out so much.
We checked the crowd.
We're looking for Cord,
remember? Come on.
HOLD IT RIGHT
THERE, FELLAS.
MOVE YOUR ASS, ALEX!
COME ON, BONE.
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT
ALL RIGHT?
MR. BONE,
I DO HOPE
YOU AREN'T HURT.
COME IN, MR. BONE.
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF IT, MY DEAR.
THANK YOU.
MR. CUTTER?
RICHARD BONE.
HOW DID YOU FIND
YOUR WAY INTO
THIS HOUSE?
UH, WE USED...
GEORGE SWANSON'S
INVITATION.
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE JUST CALLED ME.
HE SEEMED QUITE
DISTURBED.
NOT VERY COHERENT.
AS I UNDERSTAND IT,
THIS YOUNG FRIEND
OF YOURS
IS PURSUING SOME
FANTASY OF HIS OWN,
AND IT INCLUDES ME.
IS THAT CORRECT?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I DON'T FIND
THAT VERY PLEASANT.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
YES, I DO.
A VETERAN, ISN'T HE?
EXCUSE ME?
I UNDERSTAND
HE'S A VETERAN.
WELL, I'VE BEEN A WAR.
I KNOW WHAT
IT DOES TO SOME MEN.
I'M WILLING TO TALK
TO YOUR FRIEND
IF YOU THINK
IT WILL DO ANY GOOD.
DO YOU THINK
IT WILL DO ANY GOOD?
ALEX!
JESUS.
ALEX?
IT WAS HIM.
ALEX?
IT WAS YOU.
WHAT IF IT WERE?
