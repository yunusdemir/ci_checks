- What's that?
- Hmm?
It sounds like the garbagemen.
On Tuesday?
Maybe they changed the schedule.
Oh, shit.
Whoa!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hey, hold it up, you guys.
I was afraid you'd miss me.
Don't worry. We won't.
That is American workmanship. You think
the Japanese invented that? Bullshit.
We did. Oh, for a while there we lost it,
but we got it back.
- I like Cadillacs.
- Come right here and get in this Cadillac.
You're gonna love it.
This is style and beauty.
Comfy, right? Oh, I know what
you're gonna say. That's vinyl.
But you don't want leather, brother.
Leather's hot, uncomfortable, it cracks.
Nothing but trouble. Look at the headroom.
You're not gonna have any problem.
Go ahead. Start it up. Listen to that.
That's power. That's performance.
- You know what I like best?
- What's that?
- The price.
- Hey! Wait a minute.
You can't drive that car in here.
Whoa! Whoa!
Hey, guys. How's it goin'?
Working, working.
Daddy. Put me down. Put me down.
- I surrender. I surrender.
- Not me.
I love you too.
Here come the sandwiches.
Why don't they call him Girl George?
- It would cut down all the confusion.
- Oh, Dad, that's so old.
When I was a boy
and rock and roll came to East Germany,
the communists said it was subversive.
Maybe they were right.
- What's in this?
- You don't wanna know.
Dad, what's wrong?
An army helicopter?
You said you wouldn't go away again.
You said you were through.
I'm not going anywhere.
Promise?
I promise.
Jackson. Harris. Secure the area.
John?
John, are you in there?
John, come on out. It's Kirby.
- I know.
- Silent and smooth, just like always.
- I better be. You taught me.
- I'm getting a little rusty.
- What's going on?
- Jenny, how are you?
Hi.
- Jenny, I need to talk to your dad, OK?
- Yeah. Got a warrant?
Very funny.
John, we've got a problem.
Someone's killing your men.
You gave them new identities.
There must have been a leak. Lawson,
Forrestal, Bennett... They've all been hit.
- Who is doing it?
- You've made enemies all over the world.
It could have been the Syrians,
the South Americans,
the Russians, or a terrorist group.
They're gonna find you.
- We were going to make a normal life here.
- You will. I promise.
I'm going into the city to coordinate
with the Federal people.
We'll nail those bastards.
In the meantime, Jackson and Harris
will stay here with you.
- Are they any good?
- Real good, but not as good as you were.
Is it bad?
I'm not leaving you,
if that's what you mean.
Then it can't be bad.
- How bad are you hit?
- I can make it. I'll be all right.
I've got to get my rifle from the shed.
Keep an eye out.
They'll be coming.
Remember, you're downwind.
The air current may tip them off.
- You think I can smell them coming?
- I did.
OK, Jenny. You go to your bedroom, OK?
And stay out of sight. I'll be right back.
- Where is she?
- Mellow out, man.
We can't talk business
with you waving guns in people's faces.
Your daughter's safe, Colonel.
Whether she stays that way is up to you.
My people got some business with you.
And if you want your kid back,
- then you gotta cooperate, right?
- Wrong.
He's coming at us. No brakes.
He's still coming, the crazy bastard.
He's gonna hit us.
Shit.
Don't move, motherfucker.
- Bennett, I thought you were...
- Dead?
You thought wrong.
Ever since you had me thrown out
of your unit, I've waited to pay you back.
Do you know what today is, Matrix?
Payday.
Tranquillizers.
- I wanted to use the real thing.
- Where's Jenny?
Do you remember me, Colonel?
I remember you, scumbag. Especially
the people you've tortured and killed.
Colonel Matrix,
you do not understand
a country like Val Verde.
It is a country that needs a president
who has an understanding of discipline.
- Why tell me?
- Because you're going to return
to Val Verde,
and you are going to kill the president
that you helped to overthrow me.
Why don't you have Bennett do it?
Sounds like something he would get off on.
Because President Velásquez
trusts you, Colonel.
After all, he made you
the hero of the revolution,
while Captain Bennett left,
shall we say, under a cloud.
Yeah. 'Cause he enjoyed killing
a little too much.
Your training, Matrix.
You can get close to President Velásquez.
You will kill him. You know, Colonel,
we went to a lot of trouble to find you.
We had to pretend Captain Bennett's death,
so that General Kirby would lead us to you.
And now that I have you,
you will do exactly as I tell you.
Fuck you.
- Daddy.
- Jenny.
Oh, you bastards.
Colonel Matrix, if you kill President
Velásquez, I will send her back to you.
If you try anything else,
I will mail her to you in pieces.
- Any sign of Matrix?
- No, sir. Just those bodies.
- You think there's more, sir?
- If he's still alive, I'd expect a lot more.
Sully'll make sure you get on the plane.
Henriques'll stay with you,
make sure you get off.
I don't hear from either one of 'em,
she's dead.
- How much are they paying you, Bennett?
- They offered me a hundred grand.
Wanna know something?
When I knew I'd get my hands on you,
I said I'd do it for nothing.
- Hold it.
- I'll be back, Bennett.
John.
I'll be ready, John.
We're running late, buddy.
So, you and Bennett met in the service.
Me and Henriques was in the service too.
There's nothing like old war buddies.
Well, have a nice trip, now.
Take care. Here.
Have some beers in Val Verde, Matrix.
It'll give everyone
a little more time with your daughter.
You're a funny guy, Sully. I like you.
That's why I'm going to kill you last.
Move.
<i>Hasta luego</i>, fellas.
First class, 7A.
And you, 7B, sir.
- Any carry-on luggage?
- Just him.
Open your mouth again and I'll nail it shut.
- You must fasten your seat belt, sir.
- Thank you.
Could I have a blanket and a pillow, please?
Sure.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
We are now preparing for departure.
Please make sure your luggage
is stored in the overhead compartments.
Make sure seat belts are fastened,
and extinguish cigarettes.
Once we reach cruising altitude
we're gonna be sewing
beverages and, later on, dinner.
Shortly after that we'll
show our feature film.
Your flight attendants are Susan
and Lance, and I'm Vicki.
We're here to make your trip
as comfortable as possible.
Have a safe and enjoyable flight.
- Excuse me. How long is the flight?
- We land in Val Verde in 11 hours.
Thank you. And do me a favor.
Don't disturb my friend. He's dead tired.
Upright, please. Thank you.
Sir, during takeoff you must remain seated.
I'm airsick.
Yeah, the bird has flown. Cargo's aboard.
Now go to the drop-off point.
Yes. <i>Gracias</i>, Sully.
Well, we are right on schedule.
With any good fortune,
today will be my last day as a civilian.
Your father seemed to be cooperating.
You will be together with him soon.
Won't that be nice?
Not nearly as nice
as watching him kick your ass.
Take her below.
Yeah, that Cindy.
My 7:40 flight to Vancouver was canceled.
So, how about dinner?
Well, I could go to bed early too.
- Maybe we should do it another time.
- Sounds like he's mad at you.
OK. Well, I like you too.
- All right, then. Talk to you soon. Bye.
- Love and careers. It's tough, ain't it?
- Sounds like you need a date.
- Well, I don't.
Oh, I bet you meet
a lot of nice boys at airports.
Listen, you're really bugging me.
Hey.
Hey, slow down.
- I got something I'd like to give you.
- I'm not interested.
- Aw, you don't know what you're missing.
- A nightmare. Would you leave me alone?
You fuckin' whore.
Don't move. I'm not going to hurt you.
Step aside.
- You said "Don't move."
- Do it.
Get in the car.
Do exactly what I tell you to do.
Listen, I've got a 7:30
advanced karate class.
You're not gonna make it.
Follow him.
I knew you were gonna say that.
Don't get offended by this question,
but are you gonna kill me?
No.
I suppose you wouldn't tell me if you were.
- Sure I would.
- Really?
Trust me.
Stay close to him.
Faster.
- That's good.
- Would you tell me what this is all about?
- A guy I trusted for years wants me dead.
- That's understandable.
I've only known you for five minutes
and I want you dead too.
I'm Cindy.
Do you have a name?
John. John Matrix.
That's nice.
- What do you do, John Matrix?
- I'm a retired colonel in the army.
Retired. Does that mean, like, um,
my taxes pay your pension?
- That's right.
-  That figures.
Out. Come on. Hurry up.
- If you're in such a hurry, I can...
- I'm almost through with you.
Listen. My daughter has been kidnapped.
He's the only chance I've got of finding her.
If he sees me or I lose him, they'll kill her.
What I need you to do is follow him,
tell him you're crazy about him.
Try to bring him over here
and I will do the rest.
You can go back to your life. Got it?
- No.
- Please, help me.
You're the only chance I've got.
She has less than 10 hours left.
- Don't you understand? They'll kill her.
- OK. I'll help you.
Listen, there's this huge guy outside in
a green T-shirt, and he's a paranoid maniac.
And he's kidnapped me.
And I need your help.
- I'll check it out.
- Thank you.
- I hear you're great with transmissions.
- That's right.
Oh, yeah. These'll work just fine.
Biggs, are you there? There's a guy
over here that may be a wacko.
- I don't think I can handle him alone.
- I'll be right there. Wanna see me kick ass?
- You'd better wait here, Miss.
- Thank you.
Attention all units.
Emergency on the theatre level.
Suspect, 6ft 2, brown hair.
He's one gigantic motherfucker.
This used to be a great place for hunting
slash. It's got a little crowded now.
I think I've found something though.
I'll see you.
What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for my...
- You lookin' for me?
- You better come with us.
Matrix.
Gimme a quarter. Gimme a quarter.
You son of a bitch.
- Out of my way.
- Freeze.
Let's go get help!
Come on.
- Stop or I'll shoot.
- No.
Hey, lady. Stop.
Wait for me. Don't you go anywhere.
Who in the hell are you?
You steal my car,
you rip the seat out, you kidnap me.
You ask me to help you
find your daughter, which I do.
You get me involved in a shoot-out.
I watch you rip a phone booth
out of the wall,
swing from the ceiling,
and then a cop's gonna shoot you
and I save you, and he starts chasing me.
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on or what?
- No.
- No?
No? My God. Watch out.
Oh!
What are you doing?
Oh, look out.
It's not my day.
Whoa!
My car.
Ahhh!
- Are you OK?
- I'm dead.
You're all right. Wait for me.
- Where is she, Sully?
- Kiss my ass.
- I can't hear you.
- I'll say it a little louder, then. Get fucked.
Loyalty is very touching, but it is not the
most important thing in your life right now.
But what is important is gravity.
I have to remind you, Sully.
This is my weak arm.
You can't kill me.
You need me to find your daughter.
- Where is she?
- I don't know. But Cooke knows.
- I'll take you to him.
- But you won't.
- Why not?
- Because I already know.
- Remember I promised to kill you last?
- That's right. You did.
I lied.
So now you don't have a car.
Now I do.
- What'd you do with Sully?
- I let him go.
I'm sorry I got you involved in this.
Well, why don't you tell me
what this is all about?
- It's about her.
- Is this your daughter?
Some people are using her
to force me to do a job.
- If I don't get to her soon, they'll kill her.
- Well, did you do the job?
No. I knew they would
kill her even if I did it.
My only chance is that I get to her
before they find out what I'm doing.
What about her mother?
- She died when Jenny was born.
- I'm sorry.
I was in Laos at the time.
So I came back intending to raise her.
But I was never home.
When she was three, I was in Lebanon.
When she was in grammar school,
I was in Angola.
When she had the measles,
I was in Pakistan.
- Now she's been kidnapped because of me.
- Why did you have to do all that traveling?
- Special assignments.
- Is that for the army or something?
- Or something.
- Oh.
What did you have to do?
Things you don't want to know about.
Things that sometimes
I wish I didn't know about.
But that part of my life is over with.
All that matters to me now is Jenny.
Let's go. Out.
Stay put.
- What are you doing?
- Helping you get her back.
Look through the drawers.
It's Cooke. Mess up the bed.
Remember you had a good time with Sully.
Open the door.
All right.
Yeah?
- Where's Sully?
- In the shower.
- Who are you?
- Room service.
Open the door.
Move back over there.
Hey, Sully.
Scared, motherfucker?
You should be, 'cause this Green Beret's
gonna kick your big ass.
I eat Green Berets for breakfast.
- And right now I'm really hungry.
- I can't believe this macho bullshit.
Fuck you, asshole.
Fuck you, asshole.
These guys eat too much red meat.
Where is she?
Cooke.
Let's go.
This must be Cooke's car.
Let's search it.
I think I've found something.
- Look at this.
- What is this?
Coastal is a fuel depot that supplies planes.
To whom? The airlines?
- Usually smaller, private aircraft.
- Are you sure?
I'm getting my pilot's license.
This is where my instructor goes.
A lot of warehouses on Redondo Street.
Arius must be keeping
a plane there. Let's go.
We'll take Cooke's car.
He won't be needing it.
This is it. Patria Enterprises.
I think this is where I was this afternoon.
You go this way and wait for my signal.
Cindy. Come on.
I've seen all their equipment,
but there's no airplane.
- What about Jenny?
- Arius and Bennett aren't here.
She is wherever they are.
Look at this.
These coordinates
are somewhere near Santa Barbara.
Longitude.
There's something going on
at this island north of here.
- This must be where they've taken Jenny.
- Look.
- Here's a photo of an amphibian airplane.
- Maybe they use it to fly out there.
Let's look at that invoice.
All right. Type 4 fuel is amphibian.
250 gallons is what it would take
to fly this plane to the island and back.
But it isn't here.
I've seen everything they've got.
It was refueled at pump station 32,
Pacific Pier. That's San Pedro.
- How long does it take to fly to the island?
- About two hours.
- Are we going to the plane?
- Not yet.
- Where are we going?
- Shopping.
Shopping?
Come on, come on.
Wow!
- What's that?
- Rocket launcher.
Go.
Freeze. Don't even think about it.
Stick him in the truck.
If you call General Franklin Kirby,
he will explain everything.
Kirby, huh?
I think we ran him in last week, right?
Hey...
Hooker. Not bad.
- What do you think she's doing?
- I think she's got something for us.
I bet she does.
- Shit.
- What the hell was that?
- Jesus Christ.
- Whoa!
- Where did you learn how to do that?
- I read the instructions.
What time you expect Matrix
to arrive in Val Verde?
Just over two hours.
Do you think he will give us any problems?
He'll do exactly as he's told
as long as he thinks
he'll get his daughter back.
- It's all clear.
- Good.
Anybody tell you
you have a lot of hostility?
Come on. Let's move.
Ooh, I hope I can fly this plane.
- Oh, shit.
- Oh...
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?
- This isn't a plane. It's a canoe with wings.
- Get in and start paddling.
- Start the engine. Hurry up.
- OK, OK.
Oh, my God. This plane is older than I am.
There's no LED read-out.
- I've only trained on a Cessna.
- Hurry up.
I'm trying.
Shit.
- Oh...
- Come on, you piece of shit. Fly or die.
Works every time.
All right. Here we go.
- Watch out for the boat.
- Oh, we're not gonna make it.
Yes, we are.
Oh...
We did it. We did it.
Wow!
- Well done.
- Thank you.
Matrix?
Have the Federals monitor police,
aviation and marine channels in the area.
- What are you expecting?
- World War Ill.
Repeat. This is Whiskey X-ray 448
for General Kirby. Urgent you respond.
<i>Attention, unidentified aircraft.
This is the Coast Guard cutter</i> Marauder.
You are flying over the San Miguel
gunnery range. This is a restricted area.
Change course or you will be
forced to land. Acknowledge.
Urgent. Repeat. Urgent.
You must contact General Franklin Kirby.
You must first change course
or you risk being shot down. Acknowledge.
They shoot the shit
out of this area all the time.
Flights out of LAX avoid it like the plague.
- Can you go below radar?
- Not marine radar.
Maybe if I get close to the water,
the waves can camouflage us.
- Go down.
- Oh, OK.
- Do it.
- Hang on.
We lost them, sir.
Slitting a little girl's throat
is like cutting warm butter.
Put the knife away
and shut your mouth.
I love listening to your little
pissant soldiers trying to talk tough.
They make me laugh.
If Matrix was here, he'd laugh too.
Mr. Bennett, my soldiers are patriots.
Your soldiers are nothing.
Matrix and I could kill every one of them,
in the blink of an eye. Remember that.
Are you trying to frighten me?
I don't have to try. When Matrix finishes
the job, he'll be back for his daughter.
Now, whether she's alive or dead
doesn't matter.
Then he'll be after you.
Now, the only thing between
Matrix and you is me.
It is you that is afraid, Mr. Bennett.
You are afraid of Matrix.
Of course. I'm smart.
But I have an edge.
I have his daughter.
- Is that it?
- That's the one.
Land here.
It's the most isolated spot we'll find.
OK. Here we go.
Now, you remember the message.
Commando, Kirby,
Code Red, coordinates. Got it.
Don't break radio silence until they see me.
How will I know?
- All fucking hell is gonna break loose.
- Be careful, Matrix. Good luck.
Thanks.
He was not on the plane.
Kill her.
Welcome back, John.
So glad you could make it.
You little bitch.
My God.
Commando. I say again, Commando.
This is Whiskey X-ray 448.
I have an emergency priority message
for a General Franklin Kirby.
I repeat, General Franklin Kirby.
General Kirby, you'd better get out here.
We have your message on the Teletype.
Ahhh!
Ahhh!
Jenny.
Jenny.
Jenny.
Daddy.
Jenny.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Jenny.
Daddy?
No. Not Daddy.
Come on.
John. How's your arm, John?
- Come over and find out.
- No, thanks. I think I'll take a pass.
John, stick your head out.
One shot, right between the eyes.
I'll make it quick. Just for old times' sake.
Bennett, stop screwing around
and let the girl go.
It's me that you want.
I have only one arm. You can beat me.
Come on, Bennett.
Throw away that chickenshit gun.
You don't just want to pull a trigger.
You want to put a knife in me
and look me in the eye,
and see what's going on in there
when you turn it.
- That's what you want to do, right?
- I'll kill you, John.
Let the girl go. It's between you and me.
Don't deprive yourself of some pleasure.
Come on, Bennett. Let's party.
I can beat you.
I don't need the girl.
I don't need the girl.
I don't need the gun, John. I can beat you.
I don't need no gun.
I'm gonna kill you now.
Ha!
You're getting old, John.
You're getting old.
John, I feel good. Just like old times.
What's it feel like to be a dying man?
You're a dead man, John.
Bullshit.
John, I'm not gonna shoot you
between the eyes.
I'm gonna shoot you between the balls.
Let off some steam, Bennett.
Daddy.
- Leave anything for us?
- Just bodies.
I'd just like you to start your unit again.
All it would take is your coming back.
This was the last time.
Until the next time.
No chance.
