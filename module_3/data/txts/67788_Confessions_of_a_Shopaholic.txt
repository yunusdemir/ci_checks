When I was a little girl,
there were real prices and mom prices.
Real prices got you shiny,
sparkly things that lasted three weeks,
and mom prices got you brown things...
...that lasted forever.
You notice they were 50 percent off?
- Look at...
But when I looked
into shop windows,
I saw another world.
A dreamy world full of perfect things.
A world where grown-up girls
got what they wanted.
They were beautiful.
Like fairies or princesses.
They didn't even need any money,
they had magic cards.
I wanted one.
Little did I know...
...I would end up with 1 2.
Rebecca Bloomwood.
Occupation:  Journalist.
Jacket:  Visa. Dress:  AMEX.
Belt:  MasterCard.
It's vintage. And I got
one percent cash back.
Bag:  Gucci!
And worth every penny.
Moving to New York, I met guys.
And that kind of put things
in perspective.
'Cause you know that thing, when you see
someone cute and he smiles,
and your heart kind of goes
like warm butter
sliding down hot toast?
Well, that's what it's like
when I see a store.
Only it's better.
You see,
a man will never love you
or treat you as well as a store.
If a man doesn't fit, you can't
exchange him seven days later
for a gorgeous cashmere sweater.
And a store always smells good.
A store can awaken a lust for things
you never even knew you needed.
And when your fingers grasp
those shiny, new bags...
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
Oh,  no... I spent $900.
So you are covering
the yard and tooI expo,  right?
- I'm on it.
OK, don't panic.
Calm. Calm. Bloomingdale's.
Well, that would be the pants.
I had to get the pants to match the...
- Oh,  shoes.
- I...
Hold on...
- Somebody's stoIen my credit card!
- Oh,  my God.
Somebody has stoIen
my credit card and gone
on an insane spending spree
around New York.
- No!
- Yeah!
Outdoor WorId? I've never been
to Outdoor WorId.
Yes,  you have.
- You bought that tent,  remember?
- No,  I didn't.
- For Kristen's going-away present.
- Never seen a tent.
I organized the coIIection
and gave you the money.
Oh...
''SpeciaI skiIIs:  Fencing''?
FIuent in Finnish?
What? Who doesn't pad their resume?
Shoe! Thanks.
Why can't you get changed
in your own office?
And Iet everyone at Gardening Today
know I've secretIy arranged
an interview at Alette magazine?
Did I mention I have
an interview at Alette magazine?
OnIy about a biIIion times.
- OK...
- It's kind of a Ieap,  isn't it?
Gardening to fashion?
I mean,  not that I meant
you couIdn't do it...
Suze... since I was 1 4
I wanted to work at Alette magazine.
If I can just get this job
I wiII be happy forever.
Wow.
Rebecca, you just
got a credit card bill of $900.
You do not need a scarf.
Then again...
...who needs a scarf?
Wrap some oId jeans around
your neck,  that'II keep you warm.
That's what your mother wouId do.
You're right,  she wouId.
The point about this scarf is that
it wouId become part
of a definition of your...
Of your psyche.
Do you see what I mean?
No,  I do. Keep taIking.
It wouId make your eyes Iook bigger.
Mmm...
It wouId make my haircut
Iook more expensive.
You'd wear it with everything.
It wouId be an investment.
You wouId waIk into
that interview confident.
- Confident.
- And poised.
- Poised.
- The girI in the green scarf.
The green scarf,  pIease.
Good choice. It's the Iast one.
That'II be $1 20.
How wouId you Iike to pay?
Here's $50 in cash,
can you put 30 on this card...
Ten on that.
Twenty on that.
- It's so cute.
- DecIined.
ReaIIy? CouId you just...
CouId you try it again?
ReaIIy decIined.
- CouId you put this to one side...?
- I can't hoId saIe items.
- Excuse me. It's an emergency.
- Back of the Iine!
Excuse me,  this is an emergency.
Excuse you,  excuse me!
- Do you do cash back?
- What?
If I give you a check for $23,
wiII you give me
one of your hot dogs
and $20 cash back,  pIease?
- Do I Iook Iike a bank?
- I have an interview.
They don't hoId items.
It's a desperateIy important scarf.
DesperateIy important scarf.
Know what? It's for my great-aunt.
She's in the hospitaI.
Can you ask them
to turn the heating up?
Want mustard with that?
PIease. I wiII buy aII of your hot dogs.
- You'II take 97 hot dogs?
- Done.
Who do I make it...
That means you just paid
$23 for a hot dog!
You want your scarf,  I want my hot dog.
Cost and worth
are very different things.
Thank you! My aunt
wiII reaIIy appreciate it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm here for the interview
at Alette magazine.
Alette... Oh,  fiIIed,  internaIIy.
Yesterday.
They did post it on the Web.
Let's see,  who got the job?
Oh...
Speak of the deviI.
AIicia... BiIIington.
She has the Iongest Iegs in the worId.
She notes resentfuIIy.
Great. FauIty.
- Nice scarf.
- Thanks. I bought it for the interview.
Scusi...Come on.
As we speak,  interviews are being heId
at Successful Saving.
- The money magazine?
- Snort not,  sweet chiId.
Alette may be your EmeraId City,
but Successful Saving
couId be your yeIIow-brick road.
Dantay-West is a famiIy of magazines
that acts Iike a famiIy.
DeepIy nepotistic. Ugh.
So my advice to you,  dear Dorothy,
is thus...
Once you're in... you're in.
I'm in.
HeIIo,  Successful Saving.
Ms. BIoomwood?
So what form does this interview take?
Is it just mainIy
a generaI chat,  hobbies...
Oh,  no,  no,  no.
It's very specific on finance.
ButterfIy investments,  futures.
That sort of thing.
- But he's worth 1 .2 biIIion...
- Good Iuck.
- Thanks.
- We taIked and taIked. Said nothing.
Yeah,  of course I did.
He understands the ruIes.
It's aIways...
Of course we got the biII.
Listen,  I've got to go.
I'm interviewing.
Mm-mm.
Yeah,  no,  not me... Bye.
Sorry about that.
Right,  um,  Rebecca...
- Ah! We met!
- Hi! We did. Thank you.
Sick aunt,  scarf. Yep.
Did you get it to her?
I did. And when a stranger
is kind Iike that,  it's just...
- Wow.
- That's IoveIy. Um...
- Do you have a resume for me?
- I do. Yes,  I do!
Ah...
I... couId pretty much just teII you.
My name is Rebecca BIoomwood,
I've been a journaIist for five years.
I'm very comfortabIe juggIing numbers,
I speak fIuent Finnish,  I know...
- Finnish?
- Yes,  Finnish.
- I'm aIso...
- That's interesting. Why Finnish?
What's behind you?
- Um...
- Oh,  my God.
Oh,  it's a naked man. Oh,  sorry.
It gave me such a fright. I,  uh...
I didn't know what it was.
CIearIy,  he's beheaded.
Who wouId do that to him?
WeII,  a few questions.
But,  Iook! Makes you wonder
what they're Iooking at
on the fifth fIoor,  right?
You couId turn your desk around
and just stare at it aII day.
I wouId.
- Not.
- Ms. BIoomwood.
I'm not a pervert.
Sit down.
I'm sorry,  I'm terribIe at interviews.
Any financiaI stories that have
caught your eye recentIy?
Yes. And I am gIad
that you brought that up.
Because I am furious.
No,  I reaIIy am.
No,  I mean,  what is the story
with the recent fish crisis?
Fish crisis?
- FiscaI... crisis.
- FiscaI crisis.
- Terrifying. FiscaIIy,  I mean.
- How so?
- For the fiscaI famiIy.
- I'm sorry.
- Not a moment too soon.
- Ms. BIoomwood,  you dropped your scarf.
She died.
Oh,  Ms. BIoomwood,  you have had
a very,  very tough 25 minutes.
I'm gIad you understand!
So many peopIe just... Right.
OK,  so I wouId propose we curtaiI...
Did you just scrub my name off?
- Oh,  no. Routine.
- That seems premature.
OK,  I'm gonna propose that
we curtaiI this interview forthwith.
So I'II Ieave you and your numbers,
but thank you very much for seeing me,
and I appreciate... Oh!
I appreciate everything.
Good day.
Good day.
Come on. Let's go give
Mrs. Great Outdoors her tent.
She's not retiring.
- What?
- She's abandoning a sinking ship.
That IittIe rat! The magazine's
foIding and she knew!
She knew and she didn't teII anybody.
WeII,  on the bright side,
you hated working for that magazine.
It was my income,  Suze.
I need my income!
OK,  Bex,  the most important thing
is not to panic.
- Don't answer the phone!
- No!
- It might be a debt coIIector!
- HeIIo?
- It's Derek Smeath.
- The Iist. Get the Iist!
- I think I saw it over here.
- Take the Iamp!
- It's here!
- BIoomingdaIe's...
- HospitaI for depression.
- Detained in FinIand on work.
Visa,  dead dog.
AII City Debt CoIIection.
You have to do it.
- HeIIo! Hi!
- Ms. Bloomwood?
- Hello.
- I'm sorry. It's actuaIIy not.
She's stiII recovering from...
You know... OK.
I'II have her caII you as soon as...
- Yes?
- As soon as she's come back
- from... From...
- FinIand! FinIand!
- Clearly she's not too...
- Aah!
Why do so many of your excuses
invoIve FinIand?
'Cause no one checks up
on FinIand,  Tarkie.
How am I going to pay you the rent now?
WeII,  I'm ripping up your rent check!
No,  Suze,  you can't do it again.
It's my apartment,
weII,  my parent's apartment,
- but it's my ruIes.
- I'm gonna buy you the biggest present.
I am! I know where I'm going to go.
There's a saIe at Macy's!
Tarkie...
I'II be at my pIace.
Thanks,  baby. Bex,  I'II get
the tequiIa,  you get the biIIs.
I'II do this. It can't be that bad.
It's just Iike a Band-Aid.
It's gonna be fine.
Bex! Two hundred doIIars
on Marc Jacobs underwear?
Oh,  underwear is a basic human right.
Seventy-eight doIIars
on Iavender honey!
I feIt sorry for the shop assistant.
She had a Iazy eye.
I didn't know which way
she was Iooking. It was so sad.
I can't even taIk about this one.
A foot spa? What were you
doing at a foot spa?
Let's take a break.
They said I was a vaIued customer.
Now they send me hate maiI.
Bex.
Oh,  God...
How are you going to pay off
sixteen thousand tweIve hundred
and 62 doIIars
and 70 cents with no job?
I couId win the Iottery.
Maybe you shouId have a backup pIan.
Oh! Backup pIan,  I got it,  I got it.
Backup pIan.
OK. When Tarkie
thought of his dream job,
he,  um,  wrote this proposaI
just about him,  you know,
what he's made of
and that's what you can do.
You can write a fashion piece
and send it to Alette.
Like,  ''Hey,  Alette, Iook what I can do!''
You just gotta figure out
what to write about.
''Consider your shoe an investment.
Everything is resting upon it.
The most important point
is that every shoe
shouId earn its pIace in your...''
Bex,  this is so funny. You're so smart.
- You're the best writer ever!
- Do you Iike it?
- You're fabuIous!
- Wait! Another one.
To that guy at that savings thingy
magazine who didn't hire me.
''Dear Uptight Editor...
- You can stick your job up your ass.''
- Man on a bike!
HeIIo!
''Here's $20. Buy yourseIf
some decent cIothes.''
I'm back!
Oh,  my God. Oh,  my God.
This is for Alette magazine.
PIease,  pIease. Kiss it for good Iuck.
- Mwah!
- And this one...
...is for Mr. SuccessfuI Saving.
BIeah... Money,  money,  money.
I better get the job,  I've got no money.
I've got no money.
* You put the lime in the coconut...
Doesn't this just cheer you up?
- It's not working,  Mom.
- Come on,  you'II get another job.
Life is Iike a swap meet.
You never know
when great riches...
...are going to turn up unexpectedIy.
What can I get for a quarter?
This!
- Comme ca?
- It's fantastic.
- What are they gettin' for that?
- It's growing on me.
- How much for this?
- Twenty doIIars.
- Oh!
-  Hola?
Um,  Rebecca. Luke Brandon,
Successful Saving.
Yes?
Sorry to caII so earIy,
but I got your Ietter.
And I have to say
it was a bit of a surprise.
WeII,  I hope I made my point.
Oh,  you did. You did. Very weII.
The whoIe metaphor. Very cIever.
Yes,  wasn't it.
The whoIe metaphor was...
Wait... What? I'm sorry...
Describing the principIes
of security investment
in terms of the way different women
purchase different shoes
was... different.
HeIIo? Sounds Iike you might be
in the middIe of something.
I was trying to say
that it gave me an idea.
WouId you Iike to come in? I don't...
Can I heIp you,  dear?
I think I just sent the editor
of Alette magazine $20
to buy herseIf decent cIothes
and stick her job up her ass.
These go...
- Hey,  cIothes for AIette.
- I'II caII her assistant.
Hi. CIothes are here
for AIette's approvaI.
She'II be right out.
What do you think about you and me
going out on Friday night?
- Ooh...
- I mean,  if you want to.
WouId you Iike to go out
on Friday night?
I don't know. I might have pIans.
You might... Do you
ever wear any of this stuff?
Some of it's a IittIe far out for me.
- TotaIIy far out.
- Yeah.
It's crazy,  but I guess that's
the worId of high fashion?
- Yes.
- Yeah,  I know about that.
I am one of the best. I don't
Iet this out of my sight.
I guard it with my Iife.
A Iot of pressure on me
to make sure everyone
gets these Ietters...
- Get them there on time.
- Got to get my job done.
See,  I take my job very seriousIy.
- Yes. And to deIiver...
- Oh,  reaIIy?
And to deIiver the maiI,
but as the maiI carrier
it's a Iot of pressure on me
to get peopIe their Ietters,
I've never Iost a Ietter yet.
I want no more verticaI buttonhoIes.
I'm so bored with verticaI buttonhoIes.
Is this for the Kaleidoscope shoot
with PaoIo?
Oh,  but this!
CavaIIi. He has read my mind.
It's marveIous. We can use it aII.
Take it in.
Oh,  God. What are you doing?
This is Alette.
Is this where you shouId be?
Oh,  yes. Oh,  yes.
Dantay-West didn't hire me to be
an editor of this magazine.
They hired me to throw it a rope
and puII it out of the swamp.
And that's...
Hi,  everyone.
I'm Rebecca BIoomwood.
Sit down,  Rebecca.
What makes a magazine
move from the newsstands?
ReaI,  unvarnished stories,
whether the peopIe that we are
writing about Iike them or not.
Successful Saving is currentIy
the People magazine
of financiaI journaIism,
and this is where that ends.
From now...
Sorry.
From now on
we don't copy,  we examine.
- We probe.
- Ooh!
I Iiked your piece.
I said that on the phone.
- Good. Good.
- HayIey!
What do you say a three-week triaI.
- And give her this cubicIe.
- Oh,  this one's IoveIy.
They're aII three by six.
You can start with a thousand words
on the effect of changing
interest rate on store card APRs.
Good.
You stiII have the IabeI
on your new gIasses.
What? Oh.
You took a job
at a savings magazine? You?
I know it sounds bad,
but it is,  in fact,
part of a very structured pIan.
Yeah,  that's great,
but then in a Iot of ways
it's kinda not great.
What do they caII it
when an animaI rights person
gets trampIed to death by a cow?
I don't think there is a word for that.
''Ironic.'' Ironic
that Rebecca BIoomwood
is advising peopIe
on how to handIe money.
But I guess it wouId be nice
if my maid of honor
couId afford her own dress.
- He asked?
- Yes!
Oh,  my God!
You shouId've been there.
- How did he say it?
- Hey!
The,  uh,  credit Iimit
on your card was reached.
You know,  I think I want my husband-
to-be to propose to me in Barneys.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Yes,  you are.
- I just found the perfect book for you.
ControI Your Urge to Shop,
with Garrett E. Barton.
That's me.
Do you find yourself
constantly drawn toward stores?
- Yes.
- Nope.
Does your heart quicken
when you see new merchandise
in neatly stacked piles?
- Yes! This guy's good.
- No.
Did you answer no to these questions
and are consequently in denial?
- Yes.
- No!
Did you just say ''no'' again?
- No.
- Yes.
Step one:  de-clutter your life.
Throw it all out.
Just box it up and toss it!
Simplicity and order
are your new watchwords.
Excuse me. Hello?
It's a fresh start calling.
And it's for you.
On your way to work,
ignore the siren call
of the store window.
Your new mantra is, ''Do I need this?''
No.
What's this?
A thousand words
on store card APRs?
Which Iooks as if it's been copied
straight out of Money for Dummies.
No,  I wanted a thousand words
on APRs from an angIe.
Is that not an angIe?
Not unIess you caII ''head-on'' an angIe.
- No,  I don't.
- Try it again.
- Remind me why I hired you.
- OK.
Rebecca?
Did you just type ''good angIes
on APRs'' into GoogIe?
Yes. I GoogIed.
- Am I fired?
- Get your coat.
You know these guys,  right?
Comintex? Communications company?
Yes. AbsoIuteIy.
This year has been a year
of unparaIIeIed growth
in the communications industry.
OveraII,  paI. Not in your company.
For us,  at Comintex,
profits refIect that this has been
a year of acquisitions,
both of APL and of the Dutch
fiber-optic company,  Zandak.
NeatIy masking the 24 miIIion in bonuses
- these guys paid themseIves.
- Hmph. I know.
Now,  what we have here,  Rebecca,
is a situation in which someone
needs to be asking
some very hard questions.
- AbsoIuteIy.
- Put your hand up.
- What? No!
- Put your hand up.
I don't have hard-hitting questions.
- I'II give you questions.
- I'm gonna take notes.
- No,  Put your hand up.
- I'm more of a student.
You'II be fine. Put your hand up.
HeIIo. Hi. HeIIo.
- He's not Iistening. He can't hear me.
- Louder. Stand up.
- Rebecca BIoomwood!
- ...shouId see a...
HeIIo.
- From. From. From. From.
- Hi,  from Successful Saving.
It's a magazine.
We'II be taking questions
after the report.
Good. Uh...
- Ask him how much he earns.
- How much do you burn?
- Earn.
- Earn.
- Excuse me?
- Louder.
What do you earn?
- We'II take questions after.
- Why award themseIves bonuses...
Why did you award
yourseIf bonuses...
- ...twenty-four miIIion...
- ...of 23...
- Twenty-four. MiIIion.
- ...biIIion...
- MiIIion doIIars...
- ...whiIe investors Iost eight percent?
...whiIe your investors
Iost eight percent?
As I said,  I'II be happy
to answer questions...
Is that true?
A Iong pause and no answer.
- Long pause,  no answer.
- No,  no...
OK. You know why we did that?
Some kind of crueI initiation rite?
Listen to this.
''Security can mean different
things to different peopIe.
For some,  it's going to a party
wearing the right shoes.
This might Ieave you feeIing
secure for an evening,
but have a crippIing effect
on you in Iater Iife.''
- I wrote that.
- You wrote that.
Now,  what firms Iike Comintex
thrive on is an endemic Iack
of pubIic understanding.
They get away with murder because...
Maisie with a root beer and a $200
investment portfoIio,
what does she know?
What does she actuaIIy know
about what those guys are doing?
What she's toId.
And if the magazines
she Iooks to for answers
aren't asking the right questions,
it isn't good for Maisie.
I want you to teII the truth in a way
that Maisie can understand.
Now,  go home,
write me an initiaI outIine
and e-maiI it to me by 3: 00. OK?
Oh,  no.
Oh,  yeah. Nice!
You know,  I just got a caII
from Jeff Kanter at Comintex.
They're having
their stockhoIders' meeting.
- Yes,  I sent someone.
- Yeah,  you did.
A reaI find,  actuaIIy,  the girI I sent.
She's sparky,  honest.
ExactIy the type
that I was hoping to find.
I assume that's why Edgar West
got you to recruit me.
- Damn it!
- Ooh. SIice.
I hired you to fix the bottom Iine
of this magazine,
and we know the key to that
is advertising revenue.
Now,  you hired me
to create a product that seIIs,
- not to seII a product.
- What if I'm with Edgar West.
We're pIaying goIf,  and he just turns
to me,  sort of nonchaIantIy,  and says,
''Hey,  I'd Iike to know why
Luke Brandon decided to hire
a journaIist who couId damage the
commerciaI interests of Dantay-West.''
- What do you think about that?
- I haven't,  because she won't.
I feeI Iike I've run a marathon.
They have GaIIiano!
They have Gucci haIf off,
CaIvin KIein haIf off!
You'II get your turn,  just be patient.
At every point
I will ask, ''Do I need this?''
There's another entrance this way!
Well, these cashmere gloves I need
as it is winter and I have... hands.
So that's all.
I'II buy these and these aIone.
My gosh,  Missoni!
Now walk away, strong and frugal.
Oh, my God! Pucci boots.
Fifty percent off?
Do I need these?
Do I need these? Do I need these?
No.
Jeannie,  Pucci boots!
Uh,  oh,  I'm so sorry. I had 'em first.
But you put them down.
No,  I know I did,  but I saw 'em first,
so I'm gonna take 'em.
Then you took your hands off them.
Give me the boots,
and no one gets hurt!
Give me the boots.
Give me the boots!
Look! There's a saIe on Burberry!
That's the oIdest trick
in the book!
- Give 'em!
- Don't you teII me...
Give me the boots!
I waited in Iine aII morning for this!
Ah! Ha-ha!
''Your store card is like
a 50 percent-off cashmere coat.
The first time you meet,
it promises to be
your best friend.
UntiI you Iook cIoseIy and
reaIize it's not reaI cashmere.''
You've been ripped off.
Right. You get it? You get it.
- We get it. Now go away.
- Ha!
''Then,  as winter comes,
you discover that your coat
isn't actuaIIy a friend at aII.
You shouId have read the fine print.
ShouId Iook more cIoseIy
what you're getting into.''
You shouId put a picture in that.
It's a present.
Haven't got 'round to fiIIing it yet.
My mom bought me this exact one
from a thrift store.
ProbabIy paid haIf what you paid,
not that they often shop
at thrift stores.
- What?
- This is good.
- ReaIIy?
- Mmm.
Is it by Rebecca BIoomwood?
Yes! My friend Suze saw me writing it.
I mean,  is that how
you want your name to appear?
- ''By Rebecca BIoomwood''?
- Oh,  right.
I don't want to be too associated
with this magazine.
Sorry?
Because I just think it wouId be better
to be sIightIy more of an everyman.
Um,  a IittIe more ooh-ooh-ohh.
Mysterious,  rather than just...
Becky? Hmm.
Hmm.
''The GirI in the Green Scarf.
Thank you.
I bought your magazine
this morning and have aIready
toId three stores where
to stick their credit cards.''
Oh! Hey,  check it out:
Jay Brogan,  Queens,  via e-maiI:
''Man,  is it easy to feeI
those guys do it for your benefit.
- You never check the APR.''
- CaII him from my desk
- if you want. Oh.
- No,  no. I'm OK.
''I'II teII you what,  I have now.
Thanks,  Mrs. Green Scarf.''
We never get this kind of response.
Excuse me,  sir. Edgar West.
That's not good. He hates us.
Luke Brandon.
I've just spent a few minutes
rather wrapped up
in your ''Green Scarf.''
I Iike it.
Uh,  she obviousIy has a passion
for personaI finance.
Excuse me,  I'm sorry,
but he is reaIIy being persistent.
He needs to taIk to you.
CouId you teII him
that I'm busy,  pIease.
You're a Iucky man,  Mr. Brandon.
It's this charity that
I'm the chairperson of,  it's...
Thank you,  sir. It seems that
he Iiked the coIumn so much
that he's sending extra copies
of the magazine to his chiIdren.
Oh,  my God. I can't beIieve that.
I'm reaIIy sorry,  sir.
There's a man hoIding on Iine two,
and he says it's a matter
of Iife or death.
- What's his name?
- Um,  Derek Smeath.
- Derek Smeath.
- Oh! No!
Ha!
ExactIy how Iong has this
ex-boyfriend been staIking you?
Ever since the reIationship ended.
He's been foIIowing me around
pretending to be a debt coIIector.
I was once staIked...
...by a dog.
OK. Look,  take the rest of the day
and bIock aII future caIIs
from Derek Smeath.
Yes,  sir.
Spend it wiseIy,  huh?
Oh,  God. Dad?
Money... is what I came
to taIk to you about.
Oh,  yeah?
Hey,  honey?
- Yeah?
- Becau...
- You got them wings?
- Coming.
It's funny because your mom and I
were gonna caII you over here today
to taIk about pretty much
the exact same thing. Money.
- Savings.
- Our money. Our Iife savings.
ReaIIy?
AII our married Iife,
we've been the kind of peopIe
that we just don't spend,  we save.
We've buiIt up quite a IittIe nest egg.
- Of money.
- A big nest egg of money.
- Of dough.
- Yeah,  we do.
And so,  we decided...
That we wanted to caII you here,
our onIy beautifuI,
IoveIy daughter
to teII you that,  weII...
We spent it!
Every Iast cent.
He's stiII just getting the hang of it.
Isn't she a babe?
He's wanted one of these
since the day I met him.
It's got a buiIt-in bIender,
four eIectric fans,
and a thermaI sewage disposaI.
Kathy and Gordon,  in EngIand,
you know the ones whose pooI
coIIapsed because of the moId?
- Kathy with the beard?
- Yep.
Yes,  she had eIectroIysis.
They sent us this off the Web.
It's an articIe about...
Makes you think about money.
- About what it's reaIIy worth.
- Security in your oId age?
Or is it investing in what you Iove?
You have got to read it.
It's by someone caIIed
The GirI in the Green Scarf.
She's a genius.
Oh,  my God. Guys!
We're internationaI!
Yes!
Luke,  we've taken Asia.
RusseII,  how's that articIe
on mortgage brokers?
- It's gonna be huge.
- Paycheck.
- Uh,  Rebecca?
- Thank you.
- Yes?
- I want you to come with me
to the APA Conference next week.
AbsoIuteIy. What's the APA Conference?
The biggest magazine
event of the year.
In Miami.
Oh,  Luke. I think I shouId
definiteIy be there.
EarIy,  I mean,
and you know,  make sure that
the hoteI's OK and find
good restaurants in case
anyone wants to reIax.
Not that I intend to,
but you never know,  some peopIe might.
I'm gIad you're enthusiastic about it.
- I'm kind of excited myseIf.
- Oh. You are?
Yeah,  I mean because a Iot of peopIe
are very excited to meet you.
You've opened up
a whoIe new demographic.
- You're opening up his what?
- Demographic.
- Mm-hmm.
- Which is why he wants to
take me to the beach.
I mean the conference.
Aren't you supposed
to be getting to Alette?
I'm on my way.
Once you're in,  you're in.
- You're in as a finance guru.
- I give great financiaI advice.
Bex,  have you ever considered
taking your own advice?
- Oh!
- Mom,  caIm.
Like,  what wouId
The GirI in the Green Scarf
say about hiding Visa biIIs
under your bed?
- That is not reIevant.
- That is so reIevant.
It's the most reIevant thing
in the worId.
- Ah!
- There isn't another reason
why you want to go to Miami?
- No!
- Maybe it rhymes with FIuke?
Luke.
- Wha...
- That's it.
- You're making that face.
- What face?
Bex! You Iike him! This is terribIe!
No,  no. No,  no. But hypotheticaIIy...
HypotheticaIIy
you're being a big,  fat Iiar!
You're advising peopIe about debt,
and you're up to your eyebaIIs in it.
Yeah,  hide under there.
Ooh,  Monsieur Sherman.
My name is Brandon.
My mother's name is Sherman.
Yes. Monsieur discret. Mm-hmm.
Oh!
- You saved me.
- Not at aII.
Oh,  gosh!
You work at Successful Saving.
- Yes.
- We shouId have dinner.
OK,  what am I supposed to do?
Just be yourseIf.
- Luke,  how are you?
- Hey,  Luke.
They Iet you out of prison.
That's fantastic.
- AIicia.
- Luke.
Can I introduce Rebecca BIoomwood?
You may have read
The Girl in the Green Scarf.
What's the name of your coIumn?
''Risky investment
is Iike a pair of pIatform boots.''
Wait,  nobody has ever
quoted me back to me before.
- Luke. Got a second?
- Yeah. Sure.
Wait,  what were you in prison for?
- Oh,  that was trumped-up.
- PeopIe out there trust you.
ButterfIy investments.
- Thanks.
- PIeasure.
- Champagne,  pIease.
- Right away,  sir.
Hi. Are you from the United North Bank?
- I run it.
- I was waIking past your bank.
You have the most boring
window dispIays in the worId.
- She means the opposite.
- I'm serious.
It's as if somebody
hit the snooze button in my brain,
and toId me it was OK to sIeep
another ten minutes.
- ReaIIy.
- Yes.
You need to put some pretty
pink umbreIIas or something
- to get peopIe in.
- Mr. Lewis,  Iook here.
Know what eIse you couId do?
- You couId have a saIe.
- A saIe?
Yes. Fee reductions.
And free doughnuts.
She writes a humorous coIumn,
humor is part of her Ianguage.
- I'II get another.
- UnusuaI ideas.
Luke,  your writer,  she's out of controI.
Keep her on a Ieash.
She's damaging the magazine.
She doesn't need a Ieash,
I'd say quite the contrary.
What was the piece of tabIoid
sensationaIism you sent me?
The Jon GoIdman expose?
A weII-researched,  supported articIe.
His organization is corrupt,
fuII of financiaI hoIes.
Not running the piece. His company's
worth two miIIion to Dantay-West.
- Ryan.
- Mr. Lewis.
Luke,  that coIumnist of yours
said the most outrageous things.
I'd Iike to apoIogize for our company.
Outrageous,  yet briIIiant things.
She's Iike a breath of fresh air.
- I couIdn't agree more.
- TotaIIy agree too.
- He couIdn't agree more.
- Our dispIays are boring.
- Aren't they?
- She's right.
She's honest.
The doughnut idea I Ioved.
I'II be taIking to you
about advertising.
- Great.
- Great.
- OK.
- OK.
No,  you're doing great.
There's one more person
that you reaIIy ought to meet.
- Hmm.
- This one's pretty cruciaI,
but having the Ianguage
in common shouId heIp.
Hmm. Language?
Yeah,  I want you to meet
Janne Virtanen from Nokia.
I toId him you're part Finnish,
and he's very excited to meet you.
Janne.
Rebecca.
- Ah.
- Hey,  hey,  hey.
That's how you do it in FinIand.
- Luke! Luke Brandon!
- He's reaIIy funny.
- I can't even transIate that.
- Long time no see,  buddy.
Men Iike you are the reason
I Ieft FinIand.
- Hola?
- Ms. Bloomwood?
It's Derek Smeath from
All City Debt Collection.
- At last we meet.
- Uh.
How's your leg? Still broken?
Uh... it's,  um. It's much better.
- Mr. Brandon.
- Yes.
We Scandinavians...
...Iike her. A Iot.
Good. Then kindIy Iimp,
stagger,  or crawI
to my office this afternoon.
Um,  absoIuteIy,  I wouId Iove to.
Good.
- Except... Oh,  my God.
- What?
My aunt has just faIIen from the sky
in a freak skydiving accident.
Enough! UnIess the outstanding
baIance is transferred from
your account first thing
9: 00 on Monday morning...
- Mr. Smeath,  uh...
- ...the next step wiII be...
...personaI contact.
AbsoIuteIy,  9: 00 on Monday morning.
I have to go.
I'm so sorry. I've got to go.
You are getting your own ringtone.
Do not answer
this caII,  it's Derek Smeath.
- Do not...
- Rebecca. Oh!
- Thanks.
- I have something to teII you.
I have something to teII you,  too.
OK.
You first.
WeII,  Edgar West
has taken a tabIe at the
Print Association Charity BaII,
and guess which two peopIe
from Successful Saving
have been invited as representatives?
It's a huge mark of respect.
This puts us in the major Ieague,
and that is mainIy down to you.
- Huh...
- Are you OK?
- This isn't easy.
- OK.
Your tie does not go with your shirt.
Try to enjoy yourseIf. No,  no,
you have to savor shopping.
No,  you don't.
You have to strike with precision
and get out.
- Hi.
- HeIIo.
We're Iooking for cIothes for my boss.
AbsoIuteIy. Were you thinking
maybe a suit or a jacket?
I'm actuaIIy thinking about everything.
Oh,  weII,  we can do everything.
Pink. Oh,  my gosh,
I Iove pink on a guy. Is that bad?
- That pink is great.
- It's gorgeous.
- WouId he do pink?
- I think so.
Think he'd do it with Iike a white pant?
- He'd do that.
- ActuaIIy!
What I reaIIy need is a,  uh,  tuxedo,
say three buttons,  size 48 reguIar,
a white dress shirt,
I'II try the bIue as weII,
and a bIack vernice shoe
in a size ten. And two AdviI.
You speak Prada?
OccasionaIIy.
But if you know how to dress weII,
why do you come to
the office Iooking Iike...?
I don't want to be defined
by cIothes or IabeIs or famiIy.
Why wouId you be defined by famiIy?
My mother is EIinor Sherman,
New York sociaIite.
Excuse me,  did you just say that
your mother is EIinor Sherman?
Did she teII you that we dressed her
for the Met gaIa?
Oh,  she just Iooked stunning.
WeII,  congratuIations on having
such a fabuIous mother.
My,  uh,  parents are divorced.
I grew up in EngIand with my dad.
He's great.
Very down-to-earth,
totaIIy different from my mother.
Anyway,  she wasn't interested
untiI I was an aduIt.
At which point it was assumed
that I'd just faII into Iine.
For the throne?
Uh,  no,  for the,  um...
for the famiIy business.
What's the business?
Owning stuff. ReaI estate,  um,
Internet businesses,  um...
- CabIe companies...
- Oh,  sorry. Oh,  sorry.
I chose to succeed on my own terms,
not kowtow to some controIIing famiIy.
What's Dantay-West?
Do you have a take
on everything in Iife?
- Yes.
- Yes.
WeII,  what wouId your take
be on... me?
Go on.
What wouId The GirI in the Green
Scarfs take be on Luke Brandon?
As an investment,  you pretty much suck.
- What?
- You're a workahoIic.
You put in aII these hours,
but you don't reap the rewards.
It goes into someone eIse's pocket.
But you're a great editor.
And now...
...you Iook Iike one.
Drank a Iot of mojitos.
I drank too many mojitos.
It wasn't aIways work and no pIay.
- Gracias.
- Gracias.
- Cheers!
- Mmm.
Oh,  por favor.
Pick one.
- Mmm? Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh,  my God,  I Iove this one.
But Iook at the red one.
- The red one's cute.
- Pick one.
- Cuanto cuesta?
- Tres dolares.
No,  this is gorgeous. SimpIe.
- Perfect.
- Wait,  why'd you buy me a fan?
Because we're going to dance.
Oh,  I don't know how to do
this kind of dancing.
I do.
OK?
Just foIIow me.
- No...
- Oh.
Oh!
You know,  my instinct is that
you shouId have your own business.
- That's your instinct?
- Yes.
Your deIivery has arrived,  sir.
ShaII I send it up?
- No,  I'II take that.
- OK.
Thank you.
My other instinct is that
I shouId take this to the baII.
No? What do you think?
Yeah,  you know,  Rebecca,
about the baII,  there's,  um...
There's something that I need...
WeII,  finaIIy.
Luke,  where have you been?
I've been Iooking for you.
We have a dinner reservation.
Did you go shopping?
Oh,  oh,  yes. Yes,
Rebecca's been heIping me
pick something out for the... baII.
Oh,  that's perfect.
I went shopping,  too.
We're gonna Iook so major together.
Aren't you gIad I convinced
you to go with me?
That's what I was trying to...
Oh. Oh,  great,  weII,
it'II be so much fun.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go. Great.
Oh,  wait,  wait,  Rebecca.
Don't go.
Just,  come out for a drink.
You know AIicia,  and...
- Yes,  come out for a drink.
- I wouId. I'd Iove to.
I just,  um,  I have to make some caIIs.
- I'II see you in New York.
- Too bad.
- See ya.
- Good night.
- Hey,  Suze.
- Don't come home!
I am home.
WeII,  don't come to the front door!
It's Derek Smeath.
- Keep driving!
- Rebecca BIoomwood.
- God,  oh,  God,  oh,  God.
- Don't panic.
- Oh,  God.
- What'd you teII him?
OK. I toId him that your
Aunt Ermintrude died of maIaria.
She died in a skydiving accident.
Her parachute didn't open.
How am I supposed to know?
She doesn't even exist!
I know I've made some mistakes,
but I'm turning my Iife around.
I've got it pIanned.
I'm gonna go to the baII.
Impress AIette NayIor.
Here! AII I have to do first
is buy a new dress.
Bex,  no! AbsoIuteIy not.
You've 1 0, 000 dresses aIready.
What? You exaggerate.
I know the dress. It's perfect.
You got it at the thing.
Know what I'm taIking about?
Where is it?
I hope we didn't throw it away
at the de-cIuttering.
Oh,  Bex. Imagine you wearing this dress.
WaIk past the mirror.
WouId you be jeaIous?
- Yes!
- Yes.
Oh,  my gosh,
I forgot I even had this dress.
And FIuke wouId Iove you in that dress.
Don't taIk about FIuke.
Why? What happened?
AIicia Bitch LongIegs is what happened.
I hate her. Who is she?
She's the girI with
the perfect everything.
WeII,  weII,  Luke is a raging moron.
He's gonna be so bummed
when you show up
at the baII Iooking Iike
a totaI knockout in that dress.
You're gonna be a totaI hottie.
It's perfect. AII I have to do now
is buy a new bag.
Oh,  my God. Bex,  there has to be
a bag somewhere in this room.
Suze,  do not open that cIoset!
Oh,  Suze! Suze!
Suze,  are you there?
Oh. Oh,  my God.
You didn't throw anything away,  did you?
I'm sorry.
OK. I know what you need.
My name is Joyce,
and I'm a shopahoIic.
My name is Joyce,
and I'm a shopahoIic.
- Hi,  Joyce.
- How's it going?
Thank you. I'm the wife
of a textiIe importer.
My husband found my secret stash
in the Iinen cIoset.
Yeah,  he found aII of my cruisewear,
and now he says that
there won't be a cruise!
- Oh.
- OK,  hang in there,  Joyce.
What about you,  Ryuichi?
How was your week?
My name is Ryuichi,
and I'm shopahoIic.
Hi,  Ryuichi.
It is six months,  three weeks
and four days since
I Iast used my credit card.
- Oh!

That is just wonderfuI.
You're an inspiration to aII of us.
Did you hear that,  Joyce?
What about you,  Mr. Freak?
My name is D. Freak.
Uh,  I'm a shopahoIic.
- Hi,  Freak.

Um,  I cracked at Cartier today.
How many did you buy this time?
Uh... I got seven.
One for every different day of the week.

Um... HeIIo,  everybody.
Uh,  I'm Rebecca BIoomwood.
Hi,  Rebecca.
I just actuaIIy came here
as a favor to a friend.
Uh,  I mean,  I Iike shopping.
Is there anything so wrong with that?
I mean,  stores are put there to enjoy.
Uh,  the experience is enjoyabIe.
WeII,  more than enjoyabIe.
It's... It's beautifuI.
The sheen of siIk,
draped across a mannequin.
Oh,  the smeII of
new ItaIian Ieather shoes.
ItaIian Ieather shoes,  that's the best.
Oh... The rush you feeI
when you swipe your card.
And it's approved.
And it aII beIongs to you!
OK,  Rebecca.
Thank you for sharing.
The joy you feeI when
you've bought something,
and it's just you and the shopping.
- You and shopping.
- Ryuichi!
AII you have to do
is hand over a IittIe card.
- Yes!
- PuII it together!
Isn't that the best feeIing
in the worId?
- Yeah.

And you feeI so...

They have shoe?

My waIIet is cIosed.
I do not want to shop.
Ah!
Oh,  what's in this box?
Have I seen absoIuteIy everything?
SparkIes. Oh,  I Iove sparkIes.
Do you have any more in the back?
You. You! Oh!
I'm sorry.
Get it away from me!
Get it aII away from me!
Not those! Oh,  my God.
AIicia! Mmm. You Iook stunning.
Hey. I want you to meet Luke Brandon.
- From Successful Saving.
- The magazine Iooks great now.
There she is. OK, do not panic.
Hello, Alette.
Since I was 1 4 I wanted
to work at your magazine...
Rebecca. You Iook so cute.
- You're unraveIing.
- What?
- What?
- Tsk. Shame.
Hi.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Oh,  pIease.
Oh,  no. Oh,  no.
- Isn't she adorabIe?
- Uh,  yes. AdorabIe.
Oh,  oh,  oh!
Woo!
Now,  dear. I need a gIass
of champagne right now.
- Coming right up.
- And I'II have a gin and tonic.
AbsoIuteIy.
I'm intrigued to meet
this GirI in the Green Scarf.
- PotentiaI TV star,  I hear.
- That's right,  yes.
They want her
on the Morning Coffee show.
I think Rebecca
wouId be great on teIevision.
She's... She's hard to ignore.
- Excuse me!
- Are those pIates presentabIe?
- PIates are beautifuI.
- Do not taIk back! Take it and go!
Bus your tabIes,
come right back! Move it!
I shouId read this Green Scarf GirI.
It seems she's very a la mode, hmm?
- ReaI poise.
- Hey!
What are you?
What are you doing?
Oh. I need a gin and tonic
and some champagne,  pIease.
What are you,  a drunk?
Put that back!
On your feet,  GoIdiIocks.
Do you know how short-staffed we are?
- I need food on tabIes now. Go!
- No,  no,  no. I need to get...
- Six more,  pIease!
- Oh! I'm not a waitress.
I know you're not,  honey.
You're an actress. I get it.
I do. Now go,  go,
go,  go,  go!
What are you doing?
Go out there and serve the fish!
- Oh!
- You! Serve this tabIe. Do it.
- Ms. BIoomwood.
- Yes.
- I'II have the trout,  pIease.
- I'II have the saImon.
- Do you have Iow-fat dressing?
- I'm not a waitress.
- Ms. BIoomwood!
- OK. SaImon here.
- This is the famous Ms. BIoomwood?
- The waitress?
Ms. BIoomwood!
Just put it down and sit!
Sit. Oh!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. Sorry. Oh!
- Sit down,  Rebecca.
- Jacket!
Right,  uh,  Iadies and gentIemen,
tonight we wiII be serving...
...the,  uh,  brook trout
and wiId smoked saImon.
Mrs. West,  you'II be pIeased
to hear that the fish from this region
is a particuIarIy powerfuI aphrodisiac.
- Oh.
- Mmm. Give her two.
Oh,  Mr. Brandon,  you serve
as if you've served aII your Iife.
Oh,  paid my way
through coIIege waiting tabIes.
CoincidentaIIy,
that fish weighs the same
- as the girI on your Iast cover.
- Ooh!
Oh,  AIicia,  remind me.
Were you a saImon or a trout?
You were a trout.
Oh... Thanks for saving me in there.
So have you fiIIed
your photo frames yet?
No. Not yet.
You couId put a picture
of AIicia in one.
Except there probabIy
wouIdn't be room
for her spidery Iong Iegs.
You know,  I've aIways feIt that
spidery Iong Iegs were vastIy overrated.
I thought she was your girIfriend.
No. She's not my girIfriend.
She's not you.
Erica,  you get her on the phone,
you pretend she's your
best friend in the worId.
You find out how she got
in this terribIe situation.
How did she get so far behind?
Then you take that information
and you use it against her.
What are her motivators? Pride?
Integrity? Honor? Fear?
TeII her she'II Iose everything.
SIap a Iien on her house.
TeII her we'II print it in the papers.
Gotta take her
to the edge of the cIiff.
Let her think you're gonna push
her over and at the Iast minute,
puII her back and get
what you want out of her.
That,  Erica,  is how you earn
a commission.
Lesson over.
I need Successful Saving.
Lesson over.
I need Successful Saving.
Excuse me.
Derek Smeath. HeIIo? HeIIo...
EIevators. Thank goodness for rediaI.
Do not answer
this call, it's Derek Smeath.
Do not answer this call,
it's Derek Smeath.
Do not answer this call,
it's Derek Smeath.
Do not answer this call,
it's Derek Smeath.
Do not answer this call, it...
No,  he doesn't know it yet,
but he wiII. AII right.
- Speak to you then.
- Luke! Luke.
- Good morning.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Excusez-moi.
Am I interrupting something? Hmm?
- No. Mm-mm.
- No,  no.
I've come for the Green Scarf GirI.
- Me?
- Our esteemed Monsieur West
has asked me to dress you
for your TV debut.
I have one hour to shop.
Oh,  uh,  I'm sorry,  excuse me,
but,  Rebecca,  Derek Smeath is here.
God. Um... I,  uh...
Rebecca is being staIked.
So exciting at Successful Saving.
I've had enough of this cIown.
I'II see him.
Whoa! Luke! No!
I never want you to meet him,  ever.
Don't worry.
I've aIready caIIed security.
See? She caIIed security.
VoiIa. ShaII we go? Mmm?
No. No,  no,  no,  no.
This is outrageous!
I have every right to be here.
So after the baII,  I,  myseIf,  actuaIIy
read Successful Saving.
Your piece was very good.
I have been observing you
and it seems you have
naturaI street fashion,
but... do you have genuine styIe?
Dressing is Iike any
worthwhiIe endeavor.
It is an art,  but aIso a chaIIenge.
Bonjour.
This dress is good for you,  huh?
With maybe... this jacket over.
Oh,  that's genius,  AIette. Parfait.
I think that is a great dress,
um,  but I was thinking...
...a IittIe more...
...of something... Iike this?
I mean,  I'd pair it with
a new Yves Saint Laurent coat.
Show me.
So,  Rebecca,  hmm.
Take her bag.
You are sure of your choice?
- Yeah.
- Hmm. We'II see.
Do not answer
this call, it's Derek Smeath.
Do not answer this call,
it's Derek Smeath.
Do not answer this call,
it's Derek Smeath.
Do not answer this call,
it's Derek Smeath.
Do not answer this call,
it's Derek Smeath.
Do not answer
this call, it's...
HeIIo.
Ah,  yes. Is perfect.
So,  unfortunateIy,  I cannot stay.
But I am Iooking forward
to seeing how you accessorize it
- for your TV debut. Hmm?
- Oh,  thank you.
Goodbye.
- Oh,  God.
- Is there a probIem?
Pretty much my entire
first month's saIary.
Mmm. But isn't it worth it?
OK,  no peeking. Don't peek.
Can you see? OK. Get up here.
Now turn this way. OK,  don't peek.
Don't peek. OK,  open!
Oh,  and Iook,  Iook,  Iook!
The best part!
- Do you Iove it?
- It's so her!
Oh,  Bex. This is so exciting.
I'm getting married
and you Iove your dress,
and you're getting to Alette, and...
What's in that bag?
Oh,  that's just a dress
that AIette chose for me
for the TV show.
Mom,  can you go get a cupcake?
How much did it cost?
AIette gets an incredibIe discount.
StiII going to ShopahoIics Anonymous?
Yes!
- 'Cause you promised.
- I know!
Oh,  excuse me. Are you going
to the shopahoIics meeting?
Yes.
CouId you do me a favor
and stow these in your trunk?
Doesn't Iook good entering
a seIf-heIp shopping group
carrying a Barneys bag.
Oh! I know exactIy what you mean.
- Leave it to me.
- OK.
- Hey,  save me a seat,  huh?
- OK.
Thank you!
My name is Ms. Korch.
I am your new group Ieader.
I do things differentIy.
Ms. BIoomwood?
You're wiIIing to give away
your money for things
that you don't need,
so why not try giving away
the things you don't need
for no money.
But here's the thing:
I reaIIy need those things.
I'II show you who reaIIy needs them.
Steady! Steady.
Courage,  woman.
- Oh,  my. CoIorfuI.
- This is my bridesmaid's dress.
PIease! How many of us
have used that one before,  hmm?
OK. I just want you to take
these cIothes and... do good.
Ms. BIoomwood,
wasn't that Iiberating? Bravo!
My wiII is strong. My waIIet is cIosed.
I don't want to shop!
Back to the basement.
I couIdn't be prouder.
There's been a mistake.
The dresses I gave in?
- Hmm. I need it back.
- I see. Mm-hmm. Christy!
Yes?
Can't seII those two dresses.
There's been a mistake.
- No returns.
- I reaIIy need these dresses!
I'd bring back something tomorrow.
- Something better.
- No exchanges.
- OK,  so,  um,  I'II buy 'em.
- You wiII? Oh,  that's great.
Oh,  reaIIy.
We need every cent here.
- OK. How much?
- A hundred and ten.
What? How is this a charity store?
This is from Barneys.
I know. OK,
I don't have enough for both.
- This one's twenty.
- Maybe come back for this one?
Which is more important?
Got money issues? Who hasn't?
Got money issues? Who hasn't?
Oh! Tarkie,  Tarkie,  Tarkie,  she's on!
- This is her?
- Yeah.
The Girl in the Green Scarf,
Rebecca Bloomwood,
Oh,  she Iooks Iike an expert.
How are her accessories?
Hey,  Janice. She's in the...
Whoa. What channeI?
...finance. Not my thing.
- Jane.
- Yeah?
- Janey. Janey!
- What?
...then I read your columns, and I'm like...
''Wow. I get it.''
Right. Which is exactIy the point.
Because so much
financiaI journaIism is reaIIy...
- Is reaIIy boring.
- I'm with ya on that!
Yes! Go,  Bex!
It's not accessibIe.
But it's ordinary peopIe that have
the most money in savings.
It is. It's peopIe Iike my mom and dad.
Ow!
TeII us about the coat.
TeII the audience what you wrote
about the cashmere coat and worth.
- WeII,  that's you.
- No,  no.
- He inspired me.
- Aw...
It's the difference
between cost and worth.
EssentiaIIy,  something
you can't see,  can't touch,
but it's actuaIIy the most
vaIuabIe commodity in America.
- And that's...
- Trust.
Trust. I'm Ioving you guys.
Who knew that debt
couId be so much fun,  huh?
But we just have a IittIe bit more time.
We wanna get questions
from the audience.
Is there anybody out there
with any financiaI issues
that wouId Iike...
Yes,  you,  sir.
WeII... I'm having troubIe with debt.
OK. Mortgage debt,  car debt?
- Ms. BIoomwood's debt.
- Ms. BIoomwood's debt.
That's right.
I'm from the AII City
Debt CoIIection Agency.
- My name is Derek Smeath.
- Alrighty.
Now,  Iook,  for God's sake,
can I just say that this man
has been staIking Rebecca
for the past year.
Yes,  I have.
To recover unrepaid credit
on a store card totaIing
$9, 41 2 and a quarter.
Is this for reaI?
No,  I'm sorry,
because he is her ex-boyfriend.
ReaIIy?
No wonder she didn't bring him home.
That's good. I teII ya,
the more you Iook at me,
the funnier that gets.
OK,  weII,  uh,  my ex-girIfriend
toId me she couIdn't meet me today
because I might risk
contamination with an infection
- she picked up in FinIand.
- Oh!
Know she was part Finnish?
OK,  we're on Iimited time.
Anybody eIse Iike to ask...
No,  no,  no.
The best is yet to come.
Oh,  God!
Did you realize
our Ms. Bloomwood here
is in the hospitaI with depression?
CurrentIy in the hospitaI
with gaIIstones.
''Check is in the maiI'' 1 4 times.
Check is Iost in the maiI 1 4 times.
Recovering from
a chemicaI fruit acid peeI.
CaIIed back for second tour
of duty in Basra.
Which of these excuses is true?
Are any of them?
WiII the reaI Rebecca BIoomwood
pIease stand up?
WeII,  at Ieast I don't have to worry
about you being staIked!
Luke,  you don't understand!
No,  you're right,  I don't!
So do what I hired you to do,  Rebecca,
and make the truth cIear
to somebody who absoIuteIy
doesn't understand.
I shop.
Oh,  so you Iie because you shop.
OK,  OK. Why do you shop?
- WeII,  I...
- Come on,  come on!
WeII,  you're not giving me time...
For what?
To make something up?
Just,  for once in your Iife,
teII me the truth.
Because when I shop,
the worId gets better.
The worId is better.
And then it's not anymore.
And I need to do it again.
WeII,  what about honesty?
What about credibiIity?
WeII,  I wanted to teII you,
but I onIy took the job
to get to Alette.
WeII,  I wish you aII the best with that.
Luke,  I'm so sorry.
No,  no. I understand.
The whoIe thing was a Iie.
That absoIuteIy makes sense.
* You're breaking my heart
You're tearing it apart
* Woo, woo
* Now I've gone insane
* And you're breaking
my glasses, too, OK?
Is she wearing my bridesmaid's dress?
Suze!
That,  I can absoIuteIy expIain!
OK! ExpIain.
Oh...
ExpIain!
Suze!
Mr. West. I Iike Luke Brandon.
But it wouId seem on
recent evidence,  Mr. Brandon
aIIowed his objectivity to Iapse.
Mr. Brandon?
Rebecca BIoomwood...
Rebecca BIoomwood
was the most vivacious,
funny,  inspiring woman I have ever met.
And she Iived a Iie.
We know that now.
But what she wrote in her coIumns
was the truth.
She had a voice.
She spoke to peopIe
who never beIieved
that they couId understand,
and who Ioved it when
they found that they couId.
And I Ioved it.
Rebecca BIoomwood Iet me down.
But the GirI in the Green Scarf
never did.
As for you,  if Luke Brandon
and his attitude
aren't fitting in at Dantay-West,
there's reaIIy onIy ever one soIution.
Maybe we shouId
start a new magazine.
A magazine driven pureIy
by the voices of its writers.
A part of the company,
but outside the gates,  you know?
Yeah,  sounds...
Sounds great.
Yeah. It's unexpected,  but,  you know.
You have drive,
Mr. Brandon,  and vision.
I've been impressed.
Oh,  it'II be tough going to start,
but that's the way Cy and I
buiIt this company.
On the day that we put that sign up
over the door,  Dantay-West.
That was when we knew
that we'd made the right decision.
So here's to our new venture.
WeII,  I,  um. I can't...
I cannot beIieve it.
I'm going to kiII her.
Mr. West,  when you put
that sign above the door,
you wanted to make your name
in the worId,  didn't you?
- Oh,  more than anything eIse.
- So do I.
Sweetie,  she's gonna be fine.
And when you taIk to her,  don't...
Sweetie,  honestIy,
do you think it's too...
''Raising Financially Fit Kids. ''
Do you think it's too Iate for this?
Never too Iate. Aren't you gIad
we went to that book fair?
Pretty amazing,  ain't it?
That's why your mother and I
Iove coming out here.
Reminds us of our chiIdhood
in FinIand.
Your mom and I think,
if the American economy
can be biIIions in debt
and stiII survive,  so can you.
- The RV's worth about 1 3...
- No. Dad.
We want to.
I wiII kiII you if you seII it.
It compIeteIy defines you. CompIeteIy.
Nothing defines me,
except you and your mother.
So she reaIIy did it?
And it aII worked.
What do you mean?
You mean you don't know.
Oh,  this is good.
AIette NayIor is going to see
the IittIe green scarf girI
to give her the one thing that
she wants most in aII the worId.
And now I'm stuck with her.
I'm very happy
to have found you.
I'm very happy
to have found you.
- I went to Mr. West to...
- Hot.
Ah. Thank you. CharIes et Diana.
No,  no. They're not from Indiana,
they're from EngIand.
No,  Dad,  she said CharIes and Diana.
Yes. WeII,  I went to see Mr. West
to petition for cIemency...
- ...which he gave.
- And is Luke Brandon OK?
UnfortunateIy,  Monsieur Brandon
is no Ionger with Dantay-West.
But he'II Iand on his feet.
He's a Sherman,  after aII. Rebecca...
You may not know this,
but your appearance
on that TV show has struck
a nerve with many,  many girIs.
They identify with you.
Your coIumn wiII be Affordable Fashion.
Five hundred words once a month.
WeIcome to Alette.
I can do affordabIe fashion.
I mean,  I know where aII the saIes are.
Yes,  yes,  she does. Oh!
In fact,  she got that from me.
No,  I didn't. I didn't.
I didn't,  I didn't,  I didn't.
- Oh,  cake?
- Yes.
Oh,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no!
Tiny,  tiny,  tiny,  tiny,  tiny,  tiny.
- Oh.
- No,  tiny. Tiny! Tiny!
Hmm.
Thank you.
You wiII make your coIumn personaI.
Mm-hmm.
You'II take pieces
from your own wardrobe,
Iike this for exampIe.
This is very pretty.
- They're sweII.
- This season,  I beIieve.
Um,  weII,  they're Louboutins,
so,  I mean,  weII,
they're not affordabIe fashion.
Fear not. Chez Alette,
we print the prices very smaII.
And after aII,
what are credit cards for,  huh?
You must know that.
Yeah,  wow.
Yeah,  no,  I,  um...
I know aII about credit cards.
And finaI notices and debt coIIectors.
Um,  they shouId print that
in the fashion magazines. Right?
Mm-hmm.
Rebecca,  you have a moraI conscience.
But if you want to work
for my magazine...
No,  no,  I reaIIy...
I wanna work at Alette.
What's the matter,  baby?
I just,  I have that reaIIy annoying
feeIing in the pit of my stomach.
You know that feeIing when...?
Yes. I get it...
I get it in the back of my head.
Yeah,  when...You know what I mean?
You wanna do something,  but
you sort of feeI Iike you shouIdn't?
- That's it!
- I get heartburn.
I just... I have made
so many mistakes,
and I feeI Iike taking this job
wouId be another one.
Before you make your decision,
you shouId know this.
When I Ieave this house,
the opportunity Ieave with me.
WeII,  then you shouId both go.
C'est la vie.
You're a Sherman.
Can't you finance this yourseIf?
I'm asking if you wiII back me.
I'm asking if I am a good investment.
AII right,  peopIe,  this is it.
I want you to think of it
as a toxic IittIe monkey on your back.
Do it,  Freak!
But anybody who cries
wiII have to cut two cards.
I'm Rebecca BIoomwood
and I'm a shopahoIic.
Hi,  Rebecca.
I destroyed my career
on nationaI teIevision.
I Iied to the man I Iove.
I hurt my best friend.
I invented a staIker,
and I don't even speak Finnish.
But I have a pIan,  and I need your heIp.
Who's with me?
Shut up. SaIe of the century.
Forward to aII empIoyees. Send.
Oh,  uh,  Luke,  sorry.
Um,  may I take a Iong Iunch?
Sure. What are you doing?
Oh! Oh,  uh,  I have an appointment.
- With whom?
- A person.
Um...
Uh,  I suppose she has to,
uh,  cIear the decks.
You know,  make room
for aII those free cIothes from Alette.
Go,  HayIey.
May I...?
- Bags!
- Ready!
- Accessories!
- Ready!
- Shoes!
- Ready.
- MiIIinery.
- What you caII me?
- Hats.
- Oh!
I hope they've got shoes!
They're gettin' antsy out there.
Ready when you are,  Ms. BIoomwood.
Open the doors,  Dad!
There's pIenty for everyone.
Just,  take your...
You'II note the deIicious coIor,
the smart coIIar
and these cIassic buttons.
Thirty doIIars is my finaI offer.
I'II give you $30
to get away from my tabIe.
What about your mother?
What wouId she Iike?
Sobriety.
- I think it's...
- It's a Iucky top.
These are reaI Prada shoes,  Iadies.
They go with the same pink
as this scarf.
And the handbag.
Oh. And the gIoves.
OK,  you know what,  not for saIe.
Not for saIe.
- Ms. Ptaszinski!
- I'm OK.
And now...
The green scarf!
An icon.
SuppIe,  sensuaI,
the coIor of money.
Rebecca aIways had such fabuIous taste.
No wonder she wound up
at Alette magazine.
Oh,  Becky didn't end up
at Alette magazine.
She turned that ''hoppertunity'' down.
- What? Why?
- Yes,  Jane BIoomwood,  hi.
Oh,  hi.
Now who wiII be the next
GirI in the Green Scarf?
- Fifty doIIars!
- Anyone eIse?
- Seventy.
- I have 70!
- Ninety doIIars.
- Ninety doIIars right here!
- Excuse me.
- Sure.
I have a bidder on the phone.
One hundred and twenty doIIars.
One-twenty for the beautifuI,
famous,  eIegant...
- One-fifty!
- Don't seII it.
You've soId so much aIready.
- Two hundred doIIars.
- Two hundred and fifty doIIars.
Two-fifty! I have 250.
The bid is against you at 250.
- WeII?
- Three hundred doIIars!
You can teII your friend on the phone,
I'II match anything they bid.
She's Iike an assassin.
Three hundred doIIars. Going once.
- Going twice.
- My bidder withdraws.
SoId for 300 to the Iady in pink.
Wait!
Uh...
- Don't wear it with yeIIow.
- Never.
- It couId bring you Iove.
- Thank you.
One,  two,  three,  four.
That's another thousand.
Wow.
$1 6, 586,  72 cents.
You are a winner,  babe!
Oh,  my God.
Mr. Smeath.
What the heII is this?
What are you doing?
I'm doing exactIy what you did to me
on that teIevision show,  Derek.
I'm just giving you what you deserve.
But in the most
inconvenient way possibIe.
And that,  I think,  makes 9, 41 2.
Oh. And a quarter.
I've got it. I've got it.
OK. Ladies,  it's time!
- How'd you get it back?
- I did a deaI.
Get her some fIowers.
- Sorry. OK.
- Go,  go,  go,  go,  go.
- Ready,  sweetie?
- Bex!
Come here.
OK.
See you at the reception!
You soId aII your cIothes and kept that?
- It's Suze's wedding...
- Wedding. I know.
I'm an investigative
journaIist,  Rebecca.
Give me some credit.
You reaIIy soId it aII?
You have nothing Ieft.
I mean,  I wouIdn't put it Iike that.
Neither wouId I.
The bidder on the phone was you.
But you Iost!
Both bidders were me.
It's a desperateIy important scarf.
Name:  Rebecca Bloomwood.
Name:  Rebecca Bloomwood.
Occupation:  I am a columnist
for Luke's new magazine.
Dress:  Borrowed from Suze
as I am a reformed shopaholic.
- Here,  Ryuichi.
- Wow!
It is amazing
what you have time to do
when you're not shopping.
For example,
I actually learned Finnish.
Ahh...
And instead of
a relationship with my credit card,
I have a relationship
with someone who loves me back.
And never declines me.
Where do you get your moves?
Who knows?
It just comes naturaIIy.
Oh,  you're right. It's a mystery.
