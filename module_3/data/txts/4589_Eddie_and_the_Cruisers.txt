IN THE SUMMER OF '63,
<i>ON THE DARK SIDE</i>
WAS THE NUMBER ONE SONG
IN THE COUNTRY.
IT'S EVEN BIGGER NOW.
Man: THAT'S JOANN CARLINO.
SHE WAS EDDIE'S GIRL.
Woman: SALLY PLAYS THE BASS.
Man: WENDELL ON SAX.
Woman: KENNY ON DRUMS.
Man: GUY ON PIANO
WAS FRANK RIDGEWAY.
HE WROTE ALL THEIR LYRICS.
CALLED HIM THE WORDMAN.
♪ ON THE DARK SIDE ♪
♪ OH, YEAH ♪
WENDELL...
Man: THAT WAS
AUGUST OF 1963.
DIED OF
A HEART ATTACK.
HE WAS ONLY 37.
MARCH 15, 1964.
IT WAS A LITTLE
AFTER 5 A.M.
EDDIE'S CAR WENT OFF
THE RARITAN BRIDGE.
MUST'VE BEEN
A HELL OF AN ACCIDENT.
WHO SAYS ACCIDENT?
YOU SAYING
HE WAS MURDERED?
COULD'VE BEEN
A SUICIDE.
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT'S
OUR HOOK GONNA BE?
WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA
THAT EDDIE'S STILL ALIVE?
YOU MEAN
"EDDIE LIVES"?
IT'S POSSIBLE.
THEY NEVER FOUND HIS BODY.
I GET IT.
EDDIE SWAM AWAY
FROM THE CAR,
HAD JIM MORRISON WAITING
FOR HIM ON SHORE,
AND THEN AMELIA EARHART
FLEW THEM BOTH TO PARIS
WHERE THEY'RE ALL
LIVING TOGETHER IN SIN.
LOOK, THERE ARE A LOT
OF HOLES IN THIS STORY.
NOW, SOMETHING WAS
GOING ON WITH THAT GROUP,
SOMETHING THAT NOBODY
KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT.
GET TO THE POINT,
MAGGIE.
DID YOU EVER HEAR OF A POET
NAMED ARTHUR RIMBAUD?
FRENCH LIT. 105.
IT WAS REQUIRED.
OK, KIDDIES,
YOU WANT TO SIT BACK
IN YOUR SEATS AND LISTEN?
SURE.
<i>"A SEASON IN HELL.</i>
"A SPIRITUAL AND
CONFESSIONAL AUTOBIOGRAPHY.
"ARTHUR RIMBAUD
WAS A GENIUS.
"HIS WRITINGS
WERE A QUEST.
"A SEARCH FOR PERFECTION.
"AN ATTEMPT TO FIND
TOTAL FREEDOM.
"AT THE AGE OF 19,
"ARTHUR RIMBAUD
COMMITTED SUICIDE,
NOT OF THE FLESH,
BUT OF THE MIND AND SOUL."
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
IT MEANS HE NEVER
WROTE ANOTHER WORD
AND DISAPPEARED
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
HE WAS NOT SEEN
NOR HEARD FROM AGAIN
FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS,
UNTIL HE REAPPEARED
IN A HOSPITAL IN MARSEILLES
ON HIS DEATHBED.
MAGGIE,
IT'S A TERRIFIC STORY.
I JUST DON'T SEE
WHAT THIS HAS GOT TO DO
WITH EDDIE WILSON.
YOU KNOW WHERE EDDIE
WAS COMING FROM
THE NIGHT OF THE ACCIDENT?
HE WAS COMING
FROM A RECORDING STUDIO
WHERE HE JUST FINISHED
TAPING AN ALBUM.
YOU KNOW WHAT THE NAME
OF THAT ALBUM WAS?
<i>A SEASON IN HELL.</i>
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS THAT WILSON'S
PULLING A RIMBAUD?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IF HE IS,
WE'VE GOT OURSELVES
ONE HELL OF A STORY,
DON'T WE, GUYS?
YOU THINK YOU CAN
GET YOUR HANDS
ON THOSE TAPES?
I WENT TO SATIN RECORDS
YESTERDAY.
I FIGURE THAT THE MASTER
HAD TO BE SITTING
IN THEIR VAULT.
I WONDERED WHY THEY NEVER
RELEASED THIS ALBUM.
YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND OUT?
THE TAPES ARE MISSING.
SOMEONE CHECKED THEM OUT
ON MARCH 16...
1964.
THE DAY AFTER EDDIE
SUPPOSEDLY DIED.
AND THAT'S GOING
TO BE OUR HOOK.

BACK ON THE CHARTS AGAIN,
EDDIE AND THE CRUISERS,
DOING <i>WILD SUMMER NIGHTS</i>
FROM THEIR HIT ALBUM,
<i>TENDER YEARS.</i>
AND THIS IS SCOTT MUNI AT N.E.W.
[TURNS RADIO OFF]
HEY, MR. RIDGEWAY!
HEY, NICE CATCH.
Mr. Ridgeway: "...AND SO
I DARED TO HOPE...
"THOUGH CHANGED,
NO DOUBT, FROM WHAT I WAS
"WHEN FIRST I CAME
AMONG THESE HILLS.
"WHEN LIKE A ROE,
I BOUNDED O'ER THE MOUNTAINS
"BY THE SIDES OF THE DEEP RIVERS
AND THE LONELY STREAMS,
"WHEREVER NATURE LED.
"MORE LIKE A MAN
"FLYING FROM SOMETHING
THAT HE DREADS

THE THING HE LOVED."
SO, WHAT'S WORDSWORTH
GETTING AT?
HE'S SAYING
THAT PLACES STAY THE SAME,
BUT PEOPLE CHANGE.
OK, DO PEOPLE CHANGE,
OR DON'T THEY?
NOW THAT'S WORTH
TALKING ABOUT.
[BELL RINGS]
ALL RIGHT.
HAVE A NICE WEEKEND.
AND REMEMBER, I DON'T WANT
TO SEE ANY OF YOUR FACES
FOR AT LEAST 48 HOURS.

WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHERE YOU RACING TO?
WHERE'S THE FIRE?
NO FIRE. THAT'S THE WAY
THE SONG WAS WRITTEN.
IT GOES THAT WAY--
UPBEAT.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
THE PROBLEM IS
IS I'M JUST SAYING WORDS.
YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA
GIVE ME A LITTLE ROOM,
SO PEOPLE KNOW
WHAT I'M SINGING ABOUT.
YOU LOSE THE BEAT,
PEOPLE MISS A STEP.
WE WANT 'EM
TO DANCE.
LOSE A BEAT,
MISS A STEP...
WHAT ARE YOU,
A MORON, SAL?
YOU BELIEVE THIS GUY?
LOOK, SAL,
I LIKE YOUR STUFF,
BUT IT JUST AIN'T
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
FORGET IT. YOU HAD
YOUR MIND MADE UP
BEFORE YOU EVEN STARTED.
SO WHAT AM I
KNOCKING MYSELF OUT FOR?
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO ARGUE WITH YOU, SAL.
YOU WANT TO GET ANOTHER
OPINION ON THE SUBJECT?
NO! FORGET IT.
JOANN,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WHAT ARE YOU
ASKIN' HER FOR?
WHY NOT ASK HER?
SHE'S GOT A BRAIN.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING?
SHE KNOWS, HUH?
EVERYBODY YOU BRING IN THIS
BAND'S AN EXPERT EXCEPT SALLY.
SALLY'S JUST A DUMB
GUINEA, RIGHT?
YOU DUMB GUINEA.
[LAUGHTER]
HEY, KID, COME HERE.
WHO, ME?
YEAH, YOU. COME HERE.
NOW, YOU HEARD WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WELL, I THINK
HE'S RIGHT.
I THINK IT NEEDS
A CAESURA.
SEE? MY WAY,
WITH A CAESAREAN.
A WHAT?
TELL HIM.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
FRANK.
TELL HIM, FRANKIE.
A CAESURA?
THAT'S
A TIMELY PAUSE,
A KIND OF
A STRATEGIC SILENCE.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
IF YOU WANT, I'LL
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
AHEM. OK.
"ONE EVENING
"I TOOK BEAUTY
IN MY ARMS,
"AND I THOUGHT
HER BITTER,
AND I INSULTED HER."
SOUNDS LIKE SHIT,
RIGHT?
OK, WAIT A MINUTE. NOW I'LL
DO IT WITH THE CAESURA.
"ONE EVENING I TOOK
BEAUTY IN MY ARMS...
"AND I THOUGHT
HER BITTER...
AND I INSULTED HER."
NOW, THAT'S GOT CLASS.
DOES THAT HAVE CLASS,
SALLY? RIGHT?
HEY, KID,
YOU CAN STAY.
AHEM.
EXCUSE ME.
OH.
CAN I HELP YOU?
MAGGIE FOLEY.
I WORK FOR
<i>MEDIA</i> MAGAZINE.
I'M DOING A STORY
ON EDDIE WILSON.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
BE OF SOME HELP.
WELL...
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW?
WELL, I'D LIKE YOU TO
TELL ME ABOUT THE PAST.
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT IT WAS LIKE
TO BE A CRUISER.
MISS, UH...
MAGGIE.
I'M SORRY. IT'S NOTHING
PERSONAL IN THIS.
I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU.
I REALLY WOULD, BUT...
FRANK, THERE ARE A LOT
OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
ABOUT THAT DAY.
YEAH, WELL, I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE UP AGAINST,
BUT THAT WAS THEN,
AND THIS IS NOW.
I DON'T CARE
TO BE INTERVIEWED.
LOOK, FRANK,
I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE
A CARNIVAL OUT OF YOUR LIFE.
NOW, I HAVE SOMETHING
VERY DIFFERENT IN MIND.
I AM GOING TO DO A TRIBUTE
TO A GROUP OF GUYS
WHO WERE AHEAD
OF THEIR TIME.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THE NIGHT EDDIE DIED,
THE CRUISERS
DIED WITH HIM.
FRANK, WHAT HAPPENED
THAT LAST NIGHT
AT THE RECORDING
STUDIO,
THE NIGHT
THAT EDDIE DIED?
THERE'S NO WAY ON EARTH
I'D GO INTO THAT WITH YOU.
FRANK, WHY NOT?
MAYBE...
MAYBE BECAUSE
EDDIE'S DEAD,
AND I'M ALIVE.
HE WAS MY FRIEND,
AND YOU,
I JUST MET.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
HELLO.
Man: WORDMAN!
WHO IS THIS?
THIS IS THE MASTER
OF VOICES,
MAKER OF CHOICES--
YOUR OLD BUDDY.
YOU DON'T REMEMBER.
DOC?
HEY THERE, WORDMAN,
SAY THERE, WORDMAN,
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO YOU?
WHAT YOU BEEN UP TO?
IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME, DOC.
IT SURE HAS, KID.
SO, UH, WHAT'S UP?
YOU NEED ME,
WORDMAN.
YOU NEED ME BAD.
IS THAT RIGHT?
WE GOT TO TALK.
HOW SOON BEFORE YOU
GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE?
WELL,
WHERE ARE YOU?
RIGHT BACK
WHERE WE STARTED, KID--
ASBURY PARK.
[TRUCK HORN HONKS
ON FREEWAY]
ALL RIGHT,
YOU NEAR-BEER FANS,
REMEMBER
<i>MOCK-BIRD, ING-BIRD,</i>
CHARLIE AND INEZ FOX,
SUMMER '63?
WELL, JAMES TAYLOR
AND CARLY SIMON
ARE BETTING YOU DON'T.
MY MAN, MY MAN,
THE WORDMAN!
LONG TIME, KID.
DOC, HOW YOU BEEN?
THE HITS
JUST KEEP ON COMING.
HEY, YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED MUCH.
STILL A KID.
DON'T BOTHER
RETURNING THE COMPLIMENT.
GIVE ME THAT STUFF,
WILL YOU, FRANK?
SIT DOWN.
HEY, MAN, THIS JOINT
AIN'T AS BAD AS IT LOOKS.
I MEAN, THE PAY AIN'T BAD.
YOU CAN'T BEAT THE HOURS.
BESIDES, THERE'S
A COLLEGE NEARBY.
THEY'RE TELLING ME I'M BECOMING
QUITE A CULT FIGURE AROUND HERE.
DOC, THAT'S GREAT.
SO, DID YOU
EVER WRITE THAT BOOK?
NO.
I NEVER GOT
AROUND TO IT.
SO, WHAT DID YOU
ASK ME HERE FOR?
WHAT'S SO URGENT?
YOU TALK TO THAT CHICK
FROM <i>MEDIA</i> MAGAZINE?
GUESS YOU KNOW
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
WITH THE CRUISERS LATELY.
SOMETHING'S BUSTING, KID,
AND IT'S BUSTING FAST.
THE WAY I SEE IT,
EDDIE'S MY TICKET OUT...
AND YOURS.
DOC...
WE DID ONE ALBUM,
12 CUTS.
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG
DEAL OUT OF NOTHING.
I'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT NOTHING.
NOTHING'S WHAT WE GOT ON
THE REISSUE OF THE OLD ALBUM.
AFTER EDDIE DIED,
I SOLD THE RIGHTS ALL BACK
TO LEW EISEN, THAT BASTARD.
REMEMBER HIM?
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN
DO ABOUT THAT NOW.
BUT THIS MOVIE THING, MAN...
YOU HEARD ABOUT
THE MOVIE DEAL, RIGHT?
<i>THE EDDIE WILSON STORY.</i>
THE WAY I SEE IT, THEY GOT
TO HAVE A SCRIPT, RIGHT?
THEY GOT TO HAVE LOCATIONS,
PERIOD STUFF, STUFF LIKE THAT.
THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN--
TECHNICAL CONSULTANTS.
THEY GOT TO COME TO US.
I MEAN, WHO ELSE THEY GOT?
AND THERE'S MORE.
THERE'S GOT TO BE PARTS
IN THERE FOR BOTH OF US.
I MEAN, NOT THAT WE SHOULD
NECESSARILY PLAY OURSELVES.
DOC, IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU CAN'T MISS.
I WISH YOU ALL
THE LUCK IN THE WORLD.
HEY, KID...
I GUESS
I LOST MY TOUCH.
I CAN'T CONVINCE YOU,
WHO CAN I CONVINCE?
LISTEN, FRANK,
GIVE ME A RIDE HOME.
MY CAR'S KIND OF
OUT OF COMMISSION.
BESIDES, THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANNA SHOW YOU.
SURE, DOC.
ANY WAY YOU WANNA PLAY.
I WAS THINKING, FRANK.
HMM?
I MEAN,
IT'S JUST AN IDEA.
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA HATE IT.
WHAT IS IT?
I WAS THINKING ABOUT BRINGING
THE GROUP BACK TOGETHER.
"EDDIE AND THE CRUISERS,
FEATURING SAL AMATO,
APPEARING NIGHTLY
AT 8:00 AND 11:00."
DIG THIS.
I CHECKED HIM OUT LAST WEEK.
HE'S GOT THIS
EDDIE WILSON LOOK-ALIKE.
NO, HE AIN'T HALF-BAD.
HE'S STARTING TO MAKE A LITTLE
NOISE, BUT YOU KNOW SALLY.
THE KID'S A NICKEL AND DIME
OPERATION.
NOW, HERE'S MY PLAN.
I FIGURE WE
GET RID OF THE LOSERS
AND BRING ON
THE CRUISERS.
YOU, THE CLONE,
SALLY, KENNY,
SOME DUDE ON SAX,
AND THE CHICK...
JOANN.
YEAH, RIGHT, JOANN.
I HEAR SHE'S BACK,
YOU KNOW?
SHE WAS OUT IN VEGAS.
CAESAR'S PALACE.
WHERE IS SHE NOW?
OVER AROUND WILDWOOD.
I HEAR SHE'S CHOREOGRAPHING
AT ONE OF THE BIG HOTELS
ON THE BOARDWALK.
I GET THE GROUP
BACK TOGETHER, RIGHT?
GET A LITTLE SEED MONEY,
GET SOME PUBLICITY,
RIGHT CLOTHES,
OPEN UP AT THE RIGHT JOINT
AT THE RIGHT TIME,
AND, FRANKIE,
WE COME BACK BIG.
EDDIE AND
THE ORIGINAL CRUISERS.
HEY, WHY NOT
DO A JAMES DEAN?
HIT THE JUNKYARDS,
BLOWTORCH EDDIE'S CAR
INTO LITTLE PIECES
FOR THE TOURIST TRADE.
ONLY DO ME A FAVOR.
LEAVE ME OUT OF IT.
I'M SORRY, KID.
IT'S OK. FORGET IT.
SHIT.
[DOG BARKING]
THEY MAY LOOK LIKE SHACKS
ON THE OUTSIDE,
BUT YOU'LL BE SURPRISED
AT THE INTERIOR.
MAID'S DAY OFF.
THIS WAS WAITING FOR ME
WHEN I GOT HOME LAST NIGHT.
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
THE SAME DECORATOR, DOC.
THEY GOT MY PLACE
THIS MORNING.
IT'S LIKE
THE OLD JOKE.
HMM?
WE MIGHT
BE PARANOID,
BUT IT DON'T MEAN
THEY AIN'T AFTER US.
WHO IS THEY?
MUSIC LOVERS.
WHY?
WE MUST HAVE
SOMETHING THEY WANT.
WHAT?
CAN'T YOU
FIGURE IT OUT?
NO.
WELL, TRY.
WHAT COULD WE HAVE
THAT'S WORTH STEALING,
MY ROBERT HALL SUIT?
YOUR WILKINSON BLADES?
OH, COME ON, DOC.
GIVE ME A BREAK.
WHAT ARE THEY AFTER?
THE TAPES.
<i>SEASON IN HELL.</i>
[PIANO PLAYING]
A TOUCH OF CLASS
FOR TONY MART'S.
THANKS.
WHAT'S THIS?
POETRY?
YEAH.
RIMBAUD.
YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM?
SURE.
UM...
HE WAS QUITE
DISREPUTABLE.
MEAN...
PERHAPS EVEN RUTHLESS
AND PERVERSE.
"A TORTURED SOUL..."
"BUT STILL..."
ONE OF THE GREATEST POETS
THAT EVER LIVED.
WOULD YOU LIKE IT?
NO, THANKS.
I GOT TO GO.
HERE.
TAKE IT WITH YOU.
A PRESENT.
I'LL JUST
BORROW IT.
OK.
SEE YA.
Eddie: JOANN WAS TELLING ME
YOU WRITE MUSIC.
THINKS YOU MIGHT BE GOOD.
I'LL GIVE YOU A TRY.
WHAT I WANT
IS SONGS THAT ECHO.
THE STUFF WE'RE DOING NOW
IS LIKE...
SOMEBODY'S BEDSHEETS--
SPREAD THEM OUT,
SOIL THEM,
SHIP THEM OUT TO LAUNDRY,
YOU KNOW?
BUT OUR SONGS...
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO...
FOLD OURSELVES UP
IN THEM FOREVER.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
THAT'S THE MOST YOU'LL EVER
GET OUT OF ME, WORDMAN.
EVER.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...
THE HOLIDAY INN
IS PROUD TO PRESENT
A GROUP THAT'S
BEEN BRINGING US HITS
FOR NEARLY 18 YEARS.
HOW ABOUT A BIG HAND
FOR SOME JERSEY BOYS
WHO REALLY MADE GOOD--
EDDIE AND THE CRUISERS,

EDDIE WILSON IS A PART
OF YESTERDAY, SURE HE IS,
BUT HE'S AS MUCH A PART OF
THIS GROUP TODAY AS I AM.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE STILL
TOGETHER, HIM AND ME.
AND NEVER A DAY PASSES
THAT I DON'T THINK
HE'S AROUND SOMEWHERE--
OUT IN THE STREET,
AROUND THE CORNER,
NOT FAR AWAY AT ALL.

LET'S GIVE 'EM A BIG HAND.
ONCE MORE FOR THIS
REALLY GREAT GROUP.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
HERE THEY COME.
HERE THEY ARE.
TAKE A BOW, SALLY.
OK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
DON'T GO AWAY.
STICK AROUND.
THERE'LL BE DANCING
TILL DAWN
TO THE KEYBOARD SOUNDS OF
OUR VERY OWN REGINA LEWIS.
THANK YOU.
SON OF A BITCH.
SON OF A BITCH.
LOOK WHAT COMES WALKING
THROUGH THE DOOR!
WORDMAN HIMSELF!
JUST LIKE I'VE BEEN
TELLING EVERYBODY,
WHEN YOU'RE HOT,
YOU'RE HOT.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
HIDING YOURSELF, WORDMAN?
TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL
IN VINELAND.
I NEVER LEFT
THE GARDEN STATE, SAL.
NO LIE?
NO.
SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.
I USED TO WONDER
ABOUT YOU.
YEAH?
YEAH.
I FIGURED MAYBE YOU
MOVED TO CALIFORNIA,
WERE WRITIN'
FOR MOVIES
UNDER AN ASSUMED
NAME, OR SOMETHIN'.
WANT A BEER?
HEY, THANKS.
MMM...WORDMAN?
HMM?
I JUST GOT INTERVIEWED
FOR TELEVISION
BY <i>MEDIA</i> MAGAZINE.
YEAH.
THEY HAD
A WHOLE CREW HERE.
THEY HAD LIGHTS AND
CAMERAS. EVERYTHING.
THAT'S GREAT, SAL.
WHAT DID
YOU TALK ABOUT?
ME.
ARE YOU HUNGRY?
WANT A SLICE?
NAH.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE REALLY
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT?
THOSE OLD TAPES...
<i>SEASON IN HELL.</i>
SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT 'EM
BEING MISSING.
WANTED TO KNOW IF I
KNEW WHERE THEY WERE.
WHAT'D YOU TELL HER?
I TOLD HER
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.
FOR ALL I CARE, THEY COULD'VE
GONE DOWN WITH EDDIE.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
SALLY, YOU WERE
ON THOSE TAPES, TOO.
THEY FIND THOSE TAPES,
WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?
I JUST ABOUT BROKE MY FINGERS
TRYING TO PLAY THAT STUFF.
WELL, THEY MUST
BE WORTH MONEY.
SOMEBODY'S WILLIN'
TO PAY FOR 'EM.
BUT WE AIN'T GONNA
SEE A DIME FROM THAT.
THEY'LL FIND A WAY
TO SCREW US.
THEY ALWAYS DO.
GUYS LIKE YOU AND ME,
THEY STRIKE OIL
UNDER YOUR GARDEN,
ALL YOU GET
IS DEAD TOMATOES.
I GET THE PICTURE.
IT'S STILL EDDIE,
ISN'T IT?
THEY COULD CARE LESS
ABOUT ME.
IT'S MORE EDDIE
THEY WANT.
AH, SALLY.
HEY.
YOU EVER WONDER WHAT IT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIKE
IF HE WAS STILL AROUND?
I USED TO WONDER.
IT ATE ME UP.
I FIGURED EDDIE WAS
MY ONE SHOT AT THE BIGS.
I THOUGHT WE COULD GO
ALL THE WAY TOGETHER.
AFTER HE DIED,
I GOT CRAZY.
SOME NIGHTS IT'S LIKE
EDDIE'S STILL ALIVE...
AND I GET MAD AT HIM
ALL OVER AGAIN.
I'M MAD AT HIM
FOR LIVING.
AND I'M MAD AT HIM
FOR DYING...
THE DUMB WAY
THAT HE DID.
SURE, IT GRIPES ME
WHEN I THINK ABOUT HOW
BIG WE COULD'VE BEEN.
♪ THE TIME IS RIGHT ♪
♪ YOU HOLD ME TIGHT... ♪
WE SIGNED
A $50,000 CONTRACT
TO DO ANOTHER ALBUM.
THAT WAS A LOT OF MONEY
IN THOSE DAYS.
THEY GAVE US
A $10,000 ADVANCE,
AND THE OFFERS
STARTED POURING IN.
THEY ALL WANTED
THE CRUISERS.
WE WERE ON SUCH A HIGH.
WE THOUGHT WE'D
NEVER COME DOWN.
ANYWAY, ONE NIGHT
DOC WAS READING OFF
THE LIST
OF POTENTIAL DATES,
AND I HEARD HIM MENTION
BENTON COLLEGE,
MY OLD SCHOOL.
NOBODY WANTED TO GO,
AND THE MONEY WAS SHORT.
ALSO, EDDIE FELT THAT IT
WASN'T OUR KIND OF PLACE,
THAT WE WOULDN'T FIT IN.
BUT I WANTED TO GO.
OH, GOD,
HOW I WANTED TO GO.
Kenny: DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?
Man: OH, MAN.
Sal: I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE
GOING TO SUMMER CAMP.
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S 600 GUYS HERE
THAT HAVEN'T SEEN A GIRL
SINCE NEW YEAR'S.
THEY BRING THEM BY TRAIN,
BY CAR, BY THE BUSLOAD.
CATTLE CARS,
THEY CALL 'EM.
SOUNDS LIKE
ZOO PARADE.
MOO!
WHINNY!
Kenny: ROUND THEM UP!
MOVE THEM OUT!
SOUTH PHILLY
WAS NEVER LIKE THIS.
Frank: COME ON, YOU GUYS.
GET OFF MY BACK.
Kenny: STRIKE ONE!
Sal: HELLO, GIRLS.
Frank: STOP IT, STOP IT.
Kenny: LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S AN ICE CREAM
CONVENTION, MAN.
OH, THEY'RE GOING TO
SACRIFICE A CRICKET.
Sal: NO. THEY'RE
GONNA SACRIFICE YOU.
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE HOME, FRANKIE?
LOOK AT THIS.
WHAT DO
WE HAVE HERE?
A REAL GROUP
OF PISTOLEROS.
HEY, WORDMAN.
THIS SHINDIG TONIGHT...
HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DRESS?
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
WE'VE PLAYED
COLLEGES BEFORE.
YEAH, SURE.
WE PLAYED ST. SOMETHING
DOWN IN DELAWARE,
FAIRLY RIDICULOUS
UP IN MADISON,
BUT WE AIN'T
NEVER PLAYED
NO FINISHING SCHOOL
LIKE THIS.
[GIRLS GIGGLING]
THIS IS A MISTAKE.
WE DON'T
BELONG HERE.
THESE PEOPLE
ARE DIFFERENT.
I'M TELLING YA,
THEY'RE GONNA EAT US UP.
THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH
OF COLLEGE KIDS,
NO BETTER THAN YOU.
HEY! I DIDN'T
SAY BETTER.
I SAID DIFFERENT.
YOU OUGHT
TO REMEMBER THAT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WHAT DO I THINK?
I'M SCARED TO DEATH.
AW, HELL, JOANN.
COME ON.
WHEN I GRADUATED
FROM HIGH SCHOOL,
I ASKED MY GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
WHAT HE THOUGHT I SHOULD DO.
HE TALKED ABOUT
BEING A BEAUTICIAN,
OR A TYPIST,
OR A NURSE.
THAT WAS ALREADY
REACHING FOR THE MOON.
THE WHOLE TIME,
HE WAS CHECKING ME OUT.
"HERE'S A RIPE ONE.
"DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT KIND OF JOB YOU GET
"BECAUSE IN A YEAR YOU'LL BE
MARRIED AND PREGNANT
"WITH THE FIRST OF SIX,
"AND THEY WON'T BE
COLLEGE MATERIAL
ANY MORE THAN YOU ARE,
COOKIE."
CASE CLOSED.
HEY, LISTEN.
THESE PEOPLE,
THEY'RE WAY BEHIND YOU.
I DON'T THINK
THEY THINK SO.
HEY, RIDGEWAY! FRANK!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
LIVINGSTON,
HOW ARE YOU?
OK. THIS IS FRANK RIDGEWAY,
MY OLD ROOMMATE.
THIS IS LOIS WILKES.
HI, LOIS.
JOANN CARLINO.
HOW YOU DOIN'?
KEITH LIVINGSTON.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
SO, WHAT, ARE YOU UP
FOR THE WEEKEND?
YEAH.
RITES OF SPRING?
YEAH.
WELL, THAT'S PERFECT.
KNOW WHO'S PLAYING
TONIGHT AT THE DANCE?
THEY'VE GOT THE CRUISERS.
YOU KNOW, THE MEAN-ASSED
BLACK GROUP OUT OF NEWARK,
THE CRUISERS.
OH, YEAH.
I HEARD OF THEM.
YOU KNOW,
WHEN THAT LOIS GIRL
ASKED ME WHERE DID I
GO TO COLLEGE,
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.
YOU TOLD HER YOU WORK
IN THE CITY. FINE.
AND WHETHER WE WERE
PINNED OR LAVALIERED?
HEY, LOOK...
YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH
TO BE HERE.
YOU MEAN
I'M GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.
THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?
SOMETIMES I THINK
YOU'RE TOO GOOD.
HOW DO
YOU KNOW I'M NOT?
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
EDDIE SAID "DIFFERENT."
YEAH.
THANKS FOR THE DATE.
ARE YOU
BEING SARCASTIC?
NO.
YOU'RE WELCOME, THEN.
[ALL SINGING]
LET'S GO BACK.
SHOWTIME YET?
I'LL JUST CHANGE
INTO MY OTHER STUFF.
NO.
IT'LL ONLY
TAKE A MINUTE.
I SAID NO.
YOU STAY LIKE THAT.
HEY, MAN.
YOU GOT SOME
FINE COLLEGE HERE.
ALL THE ADVANTAGES.
YOU GOT IVY WALLS,
LECTURE HALLS,
FULL-DRESSED BALLS,
AND YOU GOT THE CRUISERS
FOR THE NASTY STUFF.
FOR THE GET-DOWN MUSIC
AND THE HANGING TOUGH.

I TOLD HIM
I WAS LEAVING,
AND I'D TAKE
THE BUS BACK.
WHAT DID HE SAY?
HE SAID,
"OK. SURE, GO AHEAD.
"I'LL JUST
CALL UP THE UNION
AND HAVE THEM SEND
SOMEONE ELSE OVER."
LIKE SO MUCH
BUSTED PLUMBING.
THEN HE ASKED ME
TO TAKE A WALK WITH HIM.
HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
FOR THE LONGEST TIME.
THEN HE TURNED TO ME,
AND HE SAID...
"WORDMAN...
"WE NEED EACH OTHER.
WORDS AND MUSIC."
THEN HE CROSSED
HIS FINGERS
SHOWING HOW THEY
GO TOGETHER.
"REMEMBER...
WORDS AND MUSIC."
SO YOU STAYED.
YEAH.
I STAYED.
BUT <i>SEASON IN HELL...</i>
FRANK, HOW MUCH INFLUENCE
DID RIMBAUD HAVE ON EDDIE?
LOOKING FOR GHOSTS?
MAYBE.
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
EDDIE'S STILL ALIVE, DO YOU?
I GUESS NOT.
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE COINCIDENCE
OF <i>SEASON IN HELL?</i>
FRANK, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THOSE TAPES?
HEY, LOOK.
IT DIDN'T WORK.
THE RECORD COMPANY
HATED IT.
THEY NEVER RELEASED
THE ALBUM.
FRANK, I WANT TO GET
AHOLD OF THOSE TAPES
AND PLAY THEM
ON MY SHOW.
LET'S LET THEM
BE HEARD.
LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE
WHETHER THEY'RE ANY GOOD.
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY ARE.
HONEST.
I'D LIKE TO FIND THEM
AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD.
FRANK...
IS THAT WHY
YOU STOPPED WRITING?
BECAUSE THEY TOLD YOU
YOU WEREN'T ANY GOOD?
WORDS AND MUSIC,
REMEMBER?
WITHOUT EDDIE,
THERE WASN'T
ANY MORE MUSIC.
GOOD NIGHT, MAGGIE.
GOOD NIGHT, FRANK.
Eddie: I'M SERIOUS.
DOC WANTS TO GET
SALLY'S BAND AND US
TO GO BACK
ON THE CIRCUIT AGAIN.
Kenny: THE GUY'S
OUT OF HIS HEAD.
IT'S THEM OLD SONGS,
OLD MEMORIES.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU
CRAZY, MAN.
JUST A PHASE,
HUH, KENNY?
YEAH, SURE.
WE HAD SOME FUN
TIMES FOR A WHILE, HUH?
I LIKED BEING ON TOP.
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?
YOU'RE OUT THERE IN
THE BACK OF THE CADDY,
BALLING SOME CHICK,
YOU KNOW.
ONE OF OUR TUNES
COME ON THE RADIO...
WHOA! I MEAN, WHO WAS
BETTER THAN ME, RIGHT?
THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL
ABOUT THAT TIME, YOU KNOW?
I MISS IT.
YOU DON'T FOOL WITH
THE MEMORIES, HUH, FRANKIE?
I'M NOT SO SURE
I CAN STOP.
OK.
OK, BUT IF YOU'RE
GONNA DO THAT,
THEN YOU GOTTA
TAKE A LOOK
AT THE WHOLE STORY,
MAN.
I MEAN, THERE WERE
BAD TIMES, TOO--
THE FIGHTS,
THE ARGUMENTS,
THE HASSLES.
I MEAN, THINGS,
I'M SURE,
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
ALL ABOUT...
TOBY TYLER.
DID HE PLAY HELL
WITH YOU THAT NIGHT?
YEAH.
YEAH, RIGHT. YOU
REMEMBER SAL AND DOC
AT EACH OTHER'S
THROATS?
EDDIE AND JOANN
NOT BEING ABLE TO
TALK TO EACH OTHER.
NOBODY TALKING
TO EACH OTHER.
REMEMBER
WENDELL DYING?
REMEMBER THAT?
I REMEMBER.
YEAH, RIGHT.
HEART ATTACK, RIGHT?
MAN, YOU STILL DON'T
KNOW WHAT WENT DOWN.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?
HEART ATTACK,
MY ASS!
WHAT, YOU LIVE
IN A CLOUD?
IT'S TIME
YOU GREW UP.
LET'S GO.
WENDELL.
COME ON, WENDELL,
LET'S GO.
WE'VE GOT TO GO, MAN.
WENDELL.
HEY, WENDELL.
HEY.
STUPID SON OF A BITCH.
UH...
THE OTHER DAY, I BURIED
ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS.
HE WAS THE BEST SAX PLAYER
I EVER HEARD.
AND THEY TELL ME
I GOTTA COME UP HERE

YOU PEOPLE NOW.
I DON'T THINK
I'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

DOC, TAKE 6 WEEKS.
I STILL WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH IT.
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT?
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
HEY, I PUT UP 10 GRAND,
AND I EXPECT SOMETHING
FOR MY MONEY.
THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN
WAITING A YEAR FOR--
A BUNCH OF JERK-OFFS
MAKING WEIRD SOUNDS?
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE

EASY, EDDIE.
NOW, HEY, WAIT,
COME ON, MAN.
HEY, LISTEN, LEW,
HE'S UNDER PRESSURE
SINCE WENDELL DIED.
LET ME TALK TO HIM.
Eddie: YOU AIN'T
TALKIN' TO NOBODY!
LOOK, WE'LL
WORK SOMETHIN' OUT.
BULLSHIT!
DOC, DON'T
DO ME ANY FAVORS.
I DON'T NEED THIS.
Doc: LEW! LEW! LEW!
SHIT!
ARE YOU CRAZY?
WE HAD THE MONEY
IN OUR HANDS, AND YOU BLEW IT.
YOU BLEW IT!
HEY, COME ON!
EDDIE...
YOU'RE WRONG.
YOU'RE WRONG!
NOW LISTEN TO ME.
I LOVE YOU.
I'VE KNOWN YOU
LONGER THAN ANYONE ELSE.
BUT YOU'RE WRONG.
THEY WANT
<i>ON THE DARK SIDE!</i>
WHAT ARE WE GIVING 'EM,
SOME DAMN OPERA?
I DON'T KNOW EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE AFTER.
I WANT SOMETHING GREAT,
I WANT SOMETHING
THAT NOBODY'S
EVER DONE BEFORE.
WHY? WE AIN'T GREAT.
WE'RE JUST SOME GUYS
FROM JERSEY.
IF WE CAN'T BE GREAT,
THEN THERE'S NO SENSE
IN EVER PLAYING MUSIC
AGAIN, SAL.
I BLAME THIS ON YOU.
IT WAS YOU!
WE WERE DOING GOOD
TILL YOU CAME ALONG,
AND YOU GOT US
ALL SCREWED UP!
[ENGINE REVS]
EDDIE, WAIT!
EDDIE, THE MUSIC'S GREAT.
THOSE GUYS ARE WRONG.
IT REALLY IS.
EDDIE,
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
I USED TO HANG OUT HERE
WHEN I WAS A KID.
THERE USED TO BE
THIS OLD GUY
WHO OWNED THE PLACE.
WHAT A DREAMER.
HE WOULD SIFT
THROUGH THE GARBAGE
AND PUT ASIDE
BITS AND PIECES.
COME ON. I'LL SHOW YOU.
COME ON.
HE ACTUALLY BELIEVED
THAT YOU COULD
BUILD A CASTLE
OUT OF
A BUNCH OF JUNK.
WHAT A CROCK.
HOLY SHIT.
WHAT A PHONY.
[GLASS SHATTERS]
HERE WE ARE, GUYS.
RIGHT WHERE WE BELONG.
YOU GOT YOUR EDSELS...
NORGES...
DUMONTS...
AND EDDIE WILSON.
TOGETHER AT LAST,
CREATING OUR OWN
INCREDIBLE MONUMENT...
TO NOTHING.
HERE'S TO NOTHING,
FELLAS!
HERE'S TO NOTHING!
Joann: THERE WERE
SO MANY THINGS
I WANTED TO SAY TO HIM,
SO MANY QUESTIONS
I WANTED TO ASK.
BUT EDDIE AND I,
WE HAD A DEAL.
WE NEVER TALKED
ABOUT THE FUTURE.
WE THOUGHT THE PRESENT
WAS SO FINE.
WHY RUIN IT
BY PLANNING AHEAD?
BUT AS EDDIE DROVE OFF,
I KNEW...
I KNEW IT THEN...
THERE WASN'T GOING
TO BE ANY FUTURE.
IN THE MORNING,
THEY TOLD ME
EDDIE WAS GONE.
THEY HADN'T
FOUND HIS BODY.
THAT WAS ALWAYS
THE HARDEST PART TO ACCEPT.
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
THINK I'M CRAZY,
BUT I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.
LAST NIGHT
THERE WAS A CAR
SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY.
A '57 CHEVY.
JUST LIKE EDDIE'S--
JOANN, THAT CAR WAS DESTROYED
IN THE ACCIDENT, REMEMBER?
I KNOW,
BUT WHOEVER IT WAS
MUST'VE SEEN ME
LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW.
HE BLINKED
HIS HEADLIGHTS
HIGH, THEN LOW,
THEN HIGH AGAIN...
JUST LIKE EDDIE.
IT CAN'T BE.
IT CAN'T BE HIM.
WELL, WHO THEN?
WHO?
IT'S NOT EDDIE.
WHOEVER IT IS
THAT'S WATCHING
IS LOOKING TO CASH IN
ON THOSE TAPES,
BUT IT IS NOT EDDIE.
FRANK...
I KNOW WHERE
THOSE TAPES ARE.
AFTER THE ACCIDENT,
I HAD TO SAY GOOD-BYE
IN MY OWN WAY.
I WENT TO SATIN RECORDS,
GOT THE TAPES,
AND DROVE BACK
TO PALACE DEPRESSION.
TAKE ME THERE.
WATCH YOUR HEAD.
ARE YOU THERE?
YEAH.
HOLD MY HAND.
COME ON.
Frank: THERE.
Joann: GIVE ME A LIGHT.
SEE IT?
I FEEL SOMETHING.
IT'S IN A BOX.
A WOODEN BOX.
I GOT IT.
LET'S GO. COME ON.
[DOGS BARKING]
THERE'S GONNA
BE A LEFT SOON.
JUST PAST
THE GAS STATION.
THERE'S SOME OF YOU,
YOU KNOW.
YEAH, I SEE.

AND DRAWING A CROWD.
HEY, MAN...
EDDIE AND THE CRUISERS,
COAST TO COAST.
I AIN'T JUST
TALKING JERSEY!
GO GET 'EM, DOC!
LET'S GO INSIDE.

Maggie: THE INNOCENCE
OF THE FIFTIES WAS OVER,
AND SO WAS ROCK 'N' ROLL
AS WE KNEW IT.
WE WERE ENTERING
A NEW AGE.
AN AGE OF CONFUSION,
AN AGE OF PASSION,
OF COMMITMENT.
EDDIE WILSON
SAW IT COMING.
<i>SEASON IN HELL</i>
IS A TOTAL INNOVATION
FOR ITS TIME.
IT WAS A SIGNAL
OF GREATNESS YET TO COME.
EDDIE WILSON WAS
A STEP AHEAD OF US,
AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE
CAUGHT UP WITH HIM YET.
EDDIE'S BEEN DEAD
FOR ALMOST 18 YEARS,
BUT HIS MUSIC
IS AS ALIVE TODAY
AS THE DAY HE RECORDED IT.
FOR ME AND FOR EVERYONE
WHO LISTENS TO MUSIC,
EDDIE WILSON LIVES...
AND ALWAYS WILL.
