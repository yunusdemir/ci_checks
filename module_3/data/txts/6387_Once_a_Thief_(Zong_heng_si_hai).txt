to appreciate our art,
but just hope they don't
take them away from us

the thieves are Chinese,
from an...
underground painting collector.
You three remember,
I raised you

Now you got to listen to me
From now on
I'll teach you how to make a living
Joe, I'll teach you to be
sharp of eye and quick of hand

Nothing, the bus ride is jumpy!
Then go over there
Oh

No food for you
Cherie, let's eat
I stained my pants because of you
I stole food for you
Eat
Go on, eat

OK
You must be hungry, eat up
We hope that the Hong Kong police will

in stopping this crime
Cherie, you be the beggar

Go over there
OK
Uncle can you give me some bread please
I haven't eaten in days, please
Go away, beggar
Don't bother me
Please don't, please

You still deny it?
Really, it's not me
Let's get out of here
You stole my bread
Hey, let's split
You're so young, who
taught you to steal?
Stop!
Cherie, run!
You still want to run?
Cherie, come on
Those three kids stole
my bread, get them
Lady, slow down, no one

We'll keep a look out
Lady, is it good?
Very good
Take your time,

Hold it, come back
It hurts
What do you want? I didn't do anything
Don't catch them

Well? You must be starving
Yeah
It's getting cold, get some clothes
Thank you, papa
Thanks, papa
when did I become your papa?
Whenever you gave us food
You're the only one
who has been nice to us
You're not so bad yourselves
Ever think of becoming policemen?
Talk about it later
Don't have to be a
policeman to help people
That's right, papa
whenever you're in trouble, come to me
Don't ever steal again
Yes, sir
How come the painter
chose this lady as model
She looks like having a sprained neck
Jim, come and try the soup
It's been boiling for 4 hours
Well?
why does it taste like canned soup?
Go to hell
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to dear Cherie
Happy birthday to you
Congratulations, you look gorgeous
Thanks!
Today's my birthday, you do what I say
Your birthday doesn't
mean you're the boss
After this glass of champagne,
we stop stealing
All agreed?
Hey, blow out the candles
Hurry up
Hey hey, make a wish first
Go on, go
OK
I hope after we retire,
we can live in peace
Look! That's enough,
have some ice-cream!
Hehe, Snow white, Snow white!
Let me help you
Hey, you're going too fast
when I make a take, I go all the way
Make her feel better
Hey, that includes you too
Come on, she listens to you
This is embarrassing
Cherie, Cherie my love
Are you really mad at me?
Look, my Cherie Amour
You are my true loved one
The only one I swear, bar none
From head to foot need I say bun
Beauty and charm is yours, to you I run
I'd never leave, even forced by gun
I'd always want you,
even if you were a nun
with you I know my search is done
Only you bring my luck and lots of fun
I'll love you always,
as long as there is a sun
You are my true loved one
The only one I swear, bar none
From head to foot need I say bun
Beauty and charm is yours, to you I run
I'd never leave, even forced by gun
I'd always want to you,
even if you were a nun
with you I know my search is done
Only you bring my luck and lots of fun
Ah, I'm drowning
How dare you kick me?
It's not me, something hit my leg
Let me out of here
Come on
I'm freezing
Let's go, come on
You fooled me with her! Don't go
Joe, where do you want to be
when you get old?
Anywhere is fine with me
But, how about you?
I first want to live in peace and quiet
Iran is peaceful
Heaven is pretty
peaceful too
Assholes
We're always on the move
We should try to find
a place to settle down
Yeah but that's not the point
The Universe is endless, the
Brave are always searching
For some happiness,
however fleeting it may be
Actually I miss Hong Kong
I miss wonton Noodles
And Yuen Long Cakes
Shen Zheng fued goose,
Causeway Bay seafood
Sheung Wan's egg cakes
Also Stanley's jeans
Yes, Queen's Rd East, Queen's Rd West
Isn't it gorgeous here?
Yes
Let's check it out
Brigitte Barkot, Gina Lollo brigida
what are you yelling at?
I just want to check if
those two women were here
What are you saying?
Didn't you see the paper?
They said they always sunbathe here
I want their autograph
How can they have pens if they're naked?
Let's go, DOM
I have one!
Hi!
How are you?
- Hello Cherie
- Hello
Joe, Jim, welcome
How are you
Ah, how come?
How much?
Half a million
Too expensive,
the painting only worths 400,000
He said it's too expensive, 400,000
Tell him he's a motherfucker
what is he saying?
Go on
I want to ask you "where's your mother?"
I want to say hello to her
She's fine, thank you very much
You are welcome
Tell him, not a penny less
Half a million, no discount
OK, it's deal
Half a million, he agreed
VOILA
- Great
Steal this painting for me,
I gave you 2 million
Please translate. Thank you
He offered you 2 million
to steal a painting
2 million?
But you both promised
not to steal any more?
Did I say that?
I don't remember saying that
You can't break your promise
This painting is in a castle in Nice
There's also a love story attached to it
The lady in the painting
was the painter's lover
The painter died soon
after finishing the painting
and it's haunted
by his soul
Any self-respecting thief
would be proud to steal it,
but it's never...
left the castle Whoever manages it
will be famous for you it's a challenge
Such a long speech, what did he say?
I don't want to tell you
Tell me
Tell us
He said this painting is evil,
whoever steals it will die
So what do we do?
Hey!
Well?
Do it
Do it?
Ah. . .
Sorry, we've already retired
Is that true?
He asked if you're sure you can do it?
Sure, Yeah... Yeah...
OK, forget it, I'm really sorry
He said we can go now
Hey, what about the deposit?
They will contact us
Hey, let's have a drink first
Bye
Thanks, bye
It's working
A call from Hong Kong, sir
Hello, Mr Chow!
Hello, Mr Burton, any problem?
No problem, just do it
Very good
Cherie, did you see Jim?
I don't know where he went?
His "work" tools have
disappeared too, do you think. . .
Shit!
Please don't go
He can't do a thing without me
He'll be fine
I'm afraid he'll get into trouble
I knew you'd do this
You two better come back safe and sound
I'm going, you go pack up
Remember tomorrow morning 9 o'clock
Wait for me at Cannes airport
Book 3 tickets, 3 tickets
OK!
And then what?
Promise me this will be the last time
You're such a pain!
what are you doing here?
It takes turn to tango
Hey, it's too quiet, must be traps
Yeah, like lots of trap-wires
and arrows
Let's check it out
Um
Nothing
Here's the stone gate,
wonder where is the switch?
For sure it's well hidden
What are you saying?
I don't believe it! They hid
this precious painting here?
These are all cheap wines!
The hidden must be the most obvious
Hey, how come it's so long?
Let's go!
It's you
Hey, did you see that?
Hey
Damn, which one?
Hey, it moved by itself
Yeah, yeah
It goes back
Hurry up
What is it?
what are you doing?
Hey
May not be laser beams,
but electricity, yes!
God, so windy
It's for effect!
Come on
Careful
- Here
- OK
Come on
OK
Hey, careful, want me to die
How come you're so heavy
I eat a lot. Pull me up
I said pull me up, not
down want me to die?
Hold tight
Come on
Pull me up
Don't you fart
Harder
Did you get it?
Almost
Did you touch it?
Yeah, harder
Almost got it
Got it
Ready
OK
- Go
- Let's go
Hey
Hey. Do you still want your shoes?
we made it, it's the real thing
My blood is all going to my head
How come she is starring at me?
It's your lamp's reflection
Right
Hey
what are you doing?
Come help me
OK
Hurry
Come on
It's quiet here, let's go
Looks like a trap to me
Strange, so quiet, how could that be?
Wait and see
OK, here's to our friendship
There's no need for words
No, I mean that wine
is made up preserved grapes
Everyone is drunk, I alone am lucid
wow, Surat guy (Superiorintellect)
Hey, over here!
I see it
Hey...
Come on
I'll check it for you
You better!
Of course
Hey, watch your ass
I got a big one
There's one more
Easy job, cheers
Cheers
How old are you?
You should be older
See who's better?
Come on
Hurry up
Alright
Get them, don't let them escape
Quick get in
You alright?
Lucky the bullet isn't in too deep
Raise your arm
Higher
Move your finger, make a fist
No big deal, you'll make it
I warned you not to try it alone
You had to try, look at you now
I didn't do it for the French man
Don't be so superior, you're no artist
I know that
I did it for Cherie
If you did it for Cherie,
you did it for yourself
If you did it for
yourself, you did it for me
If you did it for me,
you did it for us all
what are you talking about?
You treat friends
better than the woman you love
No, I treat them both the same
Same? Say what? Are you sure?
You're saying I'm not
You treat her like an object
Sometimes good, sometimes bad
You call that treating her right?
Do you know I'm jealous of you?
Did you ever think of her?
Did you?
If you think of someone else,
you loose yourself?
You both know how I am
I like to be footloose
and care free
Who says I'll spend the
rest of my life with her?
If I like a flower, I
don't have to pick it
If I like the wind,
I don't need to bag it
If I like a cloud, I
don't need to hold it
If I like the sea, I don't...
what are you talking about?
I am talking about humans
What's that about
wind, flowers, clouds...
I was talking about women
women need to be loved, and cared for
I know after marriage,
no more freedom of Democracy
All I want are...flings!
Did you ever hear that?
A fling is not forever
Hey, do you know you're nlrrfinh?
Do you know you're wounded?
- So what?
- Are you finished?
Well?
That's it
Really?
Are you feeling better?
If you're alright, let's go
Cherie's waiting at the airport
Kill them,
get the painting whatever it takes
Jim, take the painting,
don't wait for me
Tell Cherie I'll look for her
I'll hold them off, go to the airport
OK
Boss, we're at the pier, will get them
Damn it!
Jim
Did you do it? Where's Joe?
Where is he? Jim, look
at me, what happened?
Huh, what's this?
We had some problem
I'll go look for him
No, he's dead
Let's go
I want to find him
Come on
Beautiful. . . This is art
Your money
We're two of a kind
We both love the money, good work
Thanks
Would you like to see
the Hong Kong by night?
Sure, sure
Yeah! show him around
Someone will show you around
Thank you!
I heard that the crime
problem in H.K. is very serious
Dad, dad!
Joe, you are still alive
Your leg...
I am lucky, the explosion
hasn't ended my life
It's all dad's fault,
it must be the French man
I'll get him
Your brother used to be
the best in his field
Joe, come and ski with me some time
If you still can
Dad, I hope you'll think of me
for old times sake
I'm useless now
Think of me as charity, give me a boost
Joe, you know. . .
dad is pained to see you like this
but how do you want
me to give you about?
Joe, are you OK?
Son, are you alright?
You bastard, I'll sue you
Hey, don't talk nonsense
If you must sue the
staircase, it's what hurt you
What?
Stop yelling
He's got nothing to
do with, it's my fault
You're still protecting him?
Buy him a new wheelchair
I'm leaving
Hey, how can you eat so much?
So you can look for
yourself when I'm not there
Kick them over there
Come on, help
OK
This is embarrassing
Never mind them
Let's go
Hey, I'm busy, you go back first!
Hurry back, I'll cook for you
Do you have money?
Yeah!
Hi, Jim
Cherie
- Dad
- Dad
Hey, what happened to your hand?
Oh, nothing really
Cherie, why are you so thin?
Not really
Doesn't Jim feed you well?
Of course he does
Jim, you said you wanted to pay me back
what do you mean?
Steal me that painting
what painting?
Come on, follow me, come on
How come the painting is here
You don't need to know
It disappeared for 2
years, the price tripled
If it stayed losing 2 more years,
how much will it worth then?
I'll take it to the auction later
with Joe, it would be easy
Pity he lost his legs
Doesn't he die?
Jim saw him, didn't he mention it?
Papa
Somebody's looking for me? Outside?
Joe
How are you?
You used to travel a
lot, do you miss it?
Nothing's different
I still travel, but around here
My trips are smaller, quieter
But it's a lot more peaceful
I'll take you around
Never mind, my legs don't feel a thing
Come on
This is where I work,
in front is my observatory
This is my latest computer
whenever I can I play computer games
This is my guest's room
This is my newest painting,
I call it "Bud's Paradise"
This is my newest partner, Bobo
Bobo, say Hello
Hello! Hello!
This wall painting took
me 3 months, do you like it
I still exercise a lot
This side is my botanical Garden
The other side is my zoo
All the birds are from South Africa
The one sitting there looking
serious is my benefactor
He's like a father to me
Bye
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen
No need, I just came to ask you a favor
What is it?
I want you to help James
what's wrong with James?
He promised Dad
He would steal him the painting again
I'm afraid he'll get into trouble again
Please help him
You two always work together
I want to help,
but does he want to be helped?
I knew you would, I'm leaving
Bye
Cherie. Mou Amour
Come on, Cherie Mou Amour
He's depressed,
his girl friend eloped with a vulture
He almost killed himself
You haven't changed at all
Bobo, if you want to
sleep, then go to sleep
I'm heart-broken, don't you know?

This is my turf, scram
If not, you can't even
sit on a wheel chair
Don't forget!
You look
The auction house vault...
has more than 1 0 security systems
Even if you get to the
vault, it may not open
we may have to bring
the whole computer inside
No, we just need good communications
Hey, what are you two talking about?
James, do you need me?
Papa
You're going to steal again?
we're playing computer games
Well, I hope you two'll
stick to the straight path
Go back and cook
Hey, this apron looks "camp"
Be serious!
It suits you
Alright, we got everything
but the vault key
Let me steal it
What? without me?
I think I can handle this
Brother, I won't cause you any trouble
But you lost two leg already
I don't want you to
lose an arm of your life
what were you talking about?
Don't be so nosy
when do you want children?
we thought about it, not
till after this job though
You want a boy or a girl?
Of course a boy
But she wants a girl, easier to carry
Did you think of a name?
If it's a boy
- Joseph
If it's a girl
- Sherry
OK? Want me to be godfather?
Of course, who else?
But you'll have to come to the State
we plan to settle over there
Happy Birthday
Beautiful cake!
Cherie made it for you
Don't you remember

You're so fussy
I told you there's no trick
Lucky for you
The cake is delicious
Thanks
Hey, do you see him?
Who?
He's the auction director, Stanley Wu
He has the key,
but don't know where he put it
With Cherie's charm,
we'll be able to find out soon
what high praise
Jim, can I dance with your wife?
Please
Listen for the key's noise
Dad
Bringing Joe here is asking for trouble
Don't worry,

Hello, Control, it's time to work,
can you hear me?
Hey man, I can hear
you, no need to shout
Don't make me deaf
The guards are off, they haven't
locked the electricity room
I didn't think you're that good
No wonder we're partners
Don't forget I'll be with you
Whenever you get lonely,
I'll be the DJ in your ear
Control what's gotten into you
Are you possessed?
Don't worry...
As soon as you get into

Roger, the switch is off, what next?
You're not only smart,
but intelligent too
Now give me the model number,
please
JJ063

According to the computer,
the red one is dangerous
The blue one has the blues
As for the yellow one,
can't cut that one, it's the sex one
So which one do I cut?
The blue one, I hate the blues
You got it
I feel much better now
Oh, I saw a road block,
if you push the right 6 numbers
You'll win the grand price
what no.?
Hold on
Easy, first a 6, then five 8's
I used these nos. a lot,
but they never won
So I keep on trying
Are you done yet, you
one eyed trouser snake
Done
Yeah? I knew you could do it, Sherlock
Next time, don't ask me if it's so easy
Alright, whom should I ask?
I'd introduced you to watson
Hey, stop joking, let
me listen to the vault
Turn left to 32, right to 1 5
is it really this easy?
Turn left to 1 3, stop
YES!
Now put your stethoscope
on the lower lock
Then what?
How can a DJ stop talking?
You want to steal that painting?
I'm on the air now
Oh the air?

They're really cute
I gotta go bleed the
lizard, I'm lucky you're here
Can you help me, I'll be right back
Good thing you're not
stealing the painting,
they changed the security system,
as soon as you lift the painting
the vault door will automatically lock
Hello, Hi kids,
I'm Bobo the clown
Well kids, here's the
answer to the riddle
whats pink and hides
in strawberry patches?
A pink elephant
Hello,
Hello.
Joe, are you there?
Hey, hold it, don't move
Jim, Jim, Jim
Hold on
why didn't it explode? Jim, damn it
Wrong connection
Jim, are you alright, answer me
Jim, don't scare me
Damn,
it's all connected
Jim
Thanks
How come you have the keys?
How come you're here?
You put the explosive here, so why
did it explode on the other side?
Wrong socket
If you don't believe me,
I'll show you again
I dare not, let's go
Hey, I'm serious, get in, I'll show you
Did you see them?
Yeah
Are they people or ghost?
People
Let me head butt it
Change position
I head butt it
Jump!
Please grant me a bomb to kill this kid
Not again?
After war, time of peace come upon us
Super
Dad, you didn't sleep all night?
How could I? where's my painting?
with me, if you want it
give me 30 million for it
You bastard, how can you
talk to your dad like that?
I don't want to talk family bullshit,
let's talk business
OK, how do you want it?
Come to my place
Where to now?
Japan, States,
wherever you want to go?
Really?
I hope you won't leave me standing again
we'll come pick you up
as soon as we're finished
Dear, you be Clear water Bay pier
You better!
Dad
Son, where's the painting?
what happened to us?
What's wrong?
I'll never forget you raised
me, it's engraved in my heart!
Jim, I know you are very filial,
I just want my painting
I'll give you the painting,
but you have to let us go
That painting is my life,
if you give it back
to me, I'll let you go
You're so kind, thanks
for giving us freedom
Especially this chance
The money?
I raised both of you, but I never
thought you turn out so cruel
I'll exterminate you
No please
Joe
It's bullet proof vest, so what?
Nothing, but aren't you limped?
If I weren't limped,
you won't be with me
If I weren't limped,
when I came back, dad
would have killed me
Did I made you sad. . .
and cry?
what about Cherie?
I'll explain to her
where's dad?
You bastard, where's the real painting?
Kill him, don't spoil the painting
You want to buy any insurance?
Go to hell!
Black Jack. The banker win
The banker got a pair
So many Ace, you must have AIDS
Not as many as you
I'll check for you
Shit, you spoil my best suit
It's corrosive fluid
I drank the corrosive fluid
Call the ambulance
Don't panic,
I asked you not to play with fire
Call the fire truck
Stop!
what you want, dad?
Get the painting!
But it's wired
Go on
Put it out, it's gone, it's gone
The painting is gone, put it out
Put it out, put it out, oh, no!
Dad, how is painful?
Take a rest
Let me help you
You two want to kill me, not so easy
Papa
Alright, alright
Go and talk to dad for a while
All movies have the bad
guys caught at the end
This movie is no exception
Smile, hey
Don't move
You intend to leave like this?
we caught him for justice
And your wish come true,
what's the point of staying?
Clean this mess up first
what do you mean?
I'm a police officer
I can't let you go, that's illegal
I can't do this
Patricide is punishable by death
Yeah, die young
Huh, alright, that's
enough out of you two
I close my eyes
Hit him
Hey, hit him
Go on, hit
Alright, here I go
OK
Don't hit the forehead
Hit the temple
OK, here I go
Get ready
It'll hurt
They're gone already, dumb jerks
Cherie
Jim, where's Joe?
Cherie
Honey bunch
You can walk?
If I'm limping, how can I run away?
Ah, so you lied to me, you bastard
Alright, enough
You're in a rush,
I got nothing for you, except
for this fruit cake, bye
Aren't we leaving together?
Right,
didn't we say we'll always be together
Jim, well, not exactly
Every good thing has to end some time
In fact, I prefer traveling
alone, footloose and carefree
Take good care of Cherie
what do you mean?
Take care
What do we do?
I'm leaving, I wish you all the best
Joe
Yes, well, what do you want?
We don't mean you must stay
But don't you think
a promise must be kept
What did I promise?
You promised to be godfather
to our kids, remember?
That was a long time ago
Well, Cherie is pregnant now
Hey, stop that
Mustn't forget the condoms!
Are you coming?
Sure you don't want to come
Alright, cast off
Stop, wait for me
So where is the painting?
Back home
Yes!
Go back to work
