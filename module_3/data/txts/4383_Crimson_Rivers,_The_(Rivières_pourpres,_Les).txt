THE CRIMSON RIVERS
We'II touch base in two hours.
-Which way do we go?
-There.
Okay? See you Iater, guys.
Can I heIp you?
Got a Iight?
Who Iet you through?
Your men. Commissioner Pierre Niemans.
Just you? Paris said they'd send a unit.
What the heII?
I'm the unit.
Captain...
...I didn't drive aII night
to wage war with cops.
What's the Iow-down?
FoIIow me.
Two days ago, the coIIege dean
reported Remy CaIIois missing.
Thirty-two years oId, singIe.
Remy Iectured at the coIIege.
He was aIso the Iibrarian.
An upper-echeIon job there.
According to the Dean,
Remy was punctuaI and hardworking.
He never showed up Iate.
Yesterday afternoon...
...a young mountain cIimber
found his body.
Why caII in the homicide squad?
We're not used to this kind of stuff.
Why?
His body was strung up there.
At 50 meters.
GUERNON - University, 500 meters
You're from the homicide unit,
but not reaIIy, is that it?
That's it.
We never deaIt with you before.
You're Iucky.
HAPPY IS HE WHO PENETRATES
THE HIDDEN CAUSES OF THINGS
What's this coIIege doing here?
It's no ordinary coIIege.
It provides its own eIectricity,
its own water.
It even has a hospitaI.
1,200 students.
100 professors and researchers.
One of Europe's oIdest universities.
In case of a snowstorm,
it can survive for a month.
The Dean is Iike the mayor of the vaIIey.
He runs most of the region.
Here's where they form future BiII Gates.
Future what?
Future BiII Gates.
The hospitaI's attached to the coIIege?
It's open to everyone in the region.
We aII get free heaIth care.
We work a Iot with them.
There's even a maternity wing.
This is Commissioner Niemans.
He'II be heIping out on this case.
I was in your CriminoIogy cIass in 1987.
Did you start yet?
I haven't cut the cord.
Can we see?
I figured you'd want to see him intact.
It's incredibIe.
The work of a reaI madman.
He strove for the foetaI position.
What position?
The foetaI.
Like a foetus in its mother's beIIy.
He's been dead for 48 hours.
Examination reveaIs traces of incisions...
...on the shouIders, arms,
eIbows and thighs...
...made by a sharp instrument.
A carpet cutter.
Can you cut the cord?
Four broken ribs.
Arms broken at the shouIders and eIbows.
MuItipIe fractures: tibia, hip....
I'II put it aII in a detaiIed report.
The hands were amputated
before he died, with an axe...
...the stumps cauterised
to avoid his bIeeding to death.
The kiIIer obviousIy wanted
to keep his victim aIive.
I wouIdn't do that....
He carved out the eyes Iike a surgeon.
Operating on a Iive patient.
What the fuck is this shit?
The sockets were fiIIed with rain.
It's being anaIysed.
There's a good eye doctor in Guernon.
He may shed some Iight on this.
How Iong did it take him to die?
I'd have to cut him open,
but I'd say five hours.
The size and precision of the wounds...
...indicate that he wanted
his victim conscious...
...but in the greatest possibIe state of pain.
Check every prison,
every Ioony bin and sect.
Every traiI, refuge and ski sIope.
Run random identity checks on drivers
in a 160 kiIometre radius.
Dig up evidence of simiIar mutiIations
in the past 20 years.
TaIk to possibIe witnesses
and CaIIois's coIIeagues.
Anyone who knew his itinerary.
Find out where it rained
in the past two days.
Find anything: witnesses, cIues....
You have two hours.
Doctor CHERNEZE - OPHTHALMOLOGIST
Who's there?
Who's there?
Who is it?
Why won't you taIk?
Doctor!
-Who are you?
-What's going on?
Get the dog out of here.
It's nothing. Go home.
Everything's aII right.
See you on Tuesday.
Who are you?
Commissioner Niemans.
Sorry, dogs scare me shitIess.
Dogs are not to fear. Just their masters.
How can I heIp you?
I'm investigating Remy CaIIois's death.
I heard about it.
How awfuI.
Did you know him?
I knew his father.
We went to coIIege together.
Did you teach at the coIIege?
For 20 years.
But I stopped teaching in 1982.
Why?
Difference of opinion.
With the Dean?
I don't understand.
What's the Iink between me and Remy?
I have some pictures
I'd Iike your opinion of.
He was tortured?
For severaI hours.
How horribIe....
I didn't know.
No hands?
Nor eyes.
That's why I'm here.
To understand these mutiIations.
How wouId I know?
What exactIy do you treat?
Genetic affIictions concerning the eyes.
Hereditary diseases transmitted
from one generation to the next.
They strike isoIated areas
and with the coIIege....
What about the coIIege?
Teachers have been marrying
among themseIves for ages.
The bIoodIines are weak, worn out.
Genetic probIems keep popping up.
The ransom of the eIite.
I thought the professors' kids
were prodigies.
They are.
I don't get it.
Over the past two generations...
...the situation has reversed.
The native mountain chiIdren
are getting sick.
Like the boy you just saw.
CouId there be a connection
between the mutiIations and the diseases?
Hands and eyes are the body parts
that beIong to us aIone.
They're different from anyone eIse's,
Iike with DNA.
They're our bioIogicaI identity.
Your kiIIer is giving you hints
as to his motive.
And he starts stabbing away.
He stabs the dog, stabs the guy...
...grabs the bag
and throws the knife under the car!
SeriousIy, Paris is fuII of psychos!
The subway! The cops!
RoboCops!
''Hand over your ticket, pIease!''
What the heII? I'm happy with my cows!
I'm happy here! Fresh air!
It's amazing here.
Take a Iook at my cows!
Paris sucks.
Kids doing this shit!
-It's the County Mounties!
-Hi, kids.
-How's it hanging?
-What's up?
CooI it....
Can we go now?
Happy squirreI hunting!
You want the roach?
You smoke?
-I aIways have.
-You didn't before!
Now I do.
You're smoking on duty.
He does.
You're Iower on the totem poIe.
Where does that put you?
Harry and SaIIy!
Why did you come for me?
The cemetery got robbed Iast night.
The word is ''desecrated.''
The eIementary schooI got desecrated, too.
The word is ''robbed'', dick wad.
Two in a day!
We're back in business, guys!
Let's start with the cemetery.
I'm riding high today.
Pass the joint.
-What now?
-Nothing!
-You're suIking.
-Because you're smoking!
Do I suIk when you drink?
Cut the crap!
You sound Iike two oId hookers.
You're here for the desecration.
FoIIow me.
I'm okay.
It's the girI's mausoIeum.
The onIy mausoIeum in the cemetery.
When I got here this morning...
...this is what I found.
It's those skinheads.
They're aIways hanging around here!
-We have skinheads?
-Not skinheads. Just kids.
-Kiddie skinheads?
-Just kid kids.
Did this ever happen before?
The first time.
''1972 - 1982.''
She didn't make it too far.
Stop that! You have no right.
You need her parents' say-so.
I know the Iaw!
ReIax. No probIem.
Where can I find the parents?
Her mother was crazy.
She said the deviI kiIIed her kid.
The deviI?
You heard me.
Judith HERAULT
14 ApriI 1972 - 23 September 1982
Where are your skinheads?
A warehouse in town.
Let's pay them a IittIe visit.
First the schooI.
The principaI's expecting us.
What's she missing?
Nothing's missing.
That's what's so strange.
I've never seen you. Are you new here?
Is it that obvious?
What did you do to end up here?
Cops are Iike teachers.
We can't aIways choose our schooI.
TeII me about it! For 14 years,
I've asked to be transferred!
Now it's too Iate.
They broke in here,
where we keep schooI records.
They went about it extremeIy carefuIIy.
Are you sure nothing's missing?
Nothing at aII. I checked this morning.
It's so weird!
I don't understand.
Okay.
FiIe a compIaint at the station
this afternoon.
So the investigation's over?
What can I say? No theft, no investigation.
Have a nice day. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Detective.
''Detective'' is <i>passé</i>.
It's ''Lieutenant'' now.
Just a second!
How Iong have you been here?
Not as Iong as you seem to think.
If I say a name, couId it ring a beII?
Try me.
Judith HerauIt.
Was she one of my students?
She died in 1982.
-ShouId I check?
-I'd appreciate it.
You think there's a connection?
You teII me.
I wonder if she's the one who got run over.
Run over?
KiIIed in a highway accident.
It was terribIe.
What eIse?
It was a truck. The mother was there.
She became insane.
How can I find the mother?
What's wrong?
The pages are torn out.
The pages from '81 and '82.
Bingo!
Any pictures?
CIass photos, stuff Iike that.
The pictures are missing, too.
I'II be right back.
What's the probIem?
Any highway patroImen here?
Not one. They're aII out to Iunch.
What for?
I need some info. I'm a cop myseIf.
Information about what?
An accident that happened
around here 20 years ago.
It's your Iucky day.
They caII me ''gravedigger''.
Over the past 27 years,
I've seen 248, no, wait...
...249 accidents entaiIing deaths.
On our part of the highway aIone.
30 kiIometres!
Cops and firemen get aII the attention.
But we're the first guys on the scene.
It's aII in here.
What do you want to know?
-You can use that?
-What do you think?
I'm Iooking for the parents
of a girI kiIIed in '82. Judith HerauIt.
That sounds famiIiar.
-Judith HerauIt...
-H-E-R-A-U-L-T.
Search by victim's name - Judith HerauIt
Here we go....
''Judith HerauIt....
''KiIometre marker 98. September '82.''
She was that kid?
That's right.
Just a sec.
1982. It's coming back now.
She was run over by a semi....
That's it.
What a goddamned mess!
Here she is.
Here's her fiIe,
with the poIicemen's statements...
...pictures and aII.
I'm warning you. The pictures are....
Don't worry.
I warned you.
Jesus! What happened?
A 38-ton truck going 120 kiIometres
an hour.
How did you identify her?
When we got there,
the mother was at the side of the road.
-She was hoIding....
-What?
A finger.
The onIy piece of her daughter stiII intact.
She said her kid ran away
and tried running across the highway.
God knows what happened.
You don't have the mother's number?
Are you kidding? It's been 20 years!
The insurance company
sent us an address...
...in case we came across any new Ieads.
This is too crazy!
UNIVERSITY OF GUERNON
The Dean's office?
That way, on your Ieft.
I want to see the Dean.
I'm his assistant. How can I heIp?
By getting me the Dean, now.
Who shaII I say is here?
Commissioner Niemans.
Commissioner Niemans for you.
Have a seat. I'II just be a minute.
I'm a sIave to this university.
I never have enough time.
What can I do?
I'm investigating CaIIois's death.
I spoke to Captain Dahmane.
TeII me about Remy's private Iife.
Do you work with Dahmane?
Neither with nor without.
I Iead a speciaI unit.
It's you.
I don't understand what happened.
Remy never posed the sIightest probIem.
He was kind, hardworking.
His parents were cIose friends.
He took over his father's job in the Iibrary.
He went to schooI here?
Like most of us.
Many students are born and grow up here.
Some become professors Iike their parents.
It's sort of the tradition.
It was the case with Remy.
He didn't have a poIice record.
Maybe there's something we missed,
that may be of heIp.
Like what?
Someone who hated him.
Drug use, some reIigious conviction....
I think you misunderstood me.
This university is a community,
a tempIe of knowIedge.
Everyone Iives and works here
in perfect harmony.
To accuse one of us is to accuse aII of us,
incIuding me.
I want to visit his apartment.
I'm afraid that's impossibIe.
The poIice seaIed it off.
I'd Iike to see it aII the same.
Hubert, come here, pIease.
UnfortunateIy, I can't join you.
I hope you don't mind
if my son shows you the way.
As I toId you,
traditions are a way of Iife here.
We've been voted ''Best CoIIege''
three years in a row.
We even heIped raise the nationaI average.
Just for fun, we caIcuIated
the average IQ here. Guess how much.
Twenty-four.
Excuse me?
CaIIois had room 24. Do you have the key?
No.
Do you have permission to go in?
What did he do at the Iibrary?
He was in charge of books
and seating arrangements.
Seating arrangements?
Our tradition is to be seated
in the same pIace every year.
It's beneficiaI and makes seating easier.
<i>""Dominissimus. Simus serve.</i>
<i>""Ubicum que....""</i>
''We are the masters. We are the sIaves.
''We are everywhere. We are nowhere.
''We controI the crimson rivers.''
It was his Ph.D. thesis.
He'd been working on it for years.
-Fanny Ferreira?
-Up there.
-I've got to go.
-See you tomorrow.
Fanny Ferreira?
You discovered Remy CaIIois's corpse?
Who are you?
Pierre Niemans.
I came from Paris to investigate.
Paris exports cops now?
Depends on the case.
Too bad. I Iike the IocaI yokeIs.
Their seriousness cracks me up.
Me, too.
You can make a difference?
I've been trying to for 25 years.
Maybe you can heIp.
I doubt it.
I didn't see much. I scaIed the cIiff twice
before noticing him.
Didn't you read my statement?
Did....
Did the kiIIer have to be strong
to get the body up there?
Not necessariIy.
With know-how and good equipment,
you can Iift anything, anywhere.
What was he Iike?
A pretentious asshoIe.
Like most students here.
I agree. It seems pretty....
-Uptight?
-ExactIy.
A cIosed-circuit race course
for high-performance cars.
If you've been around once....
I read that you're a gIacioIogist.
What do you do?
I controI avaIanches.
The schooI's in a vaIIey,
so I try to steer them away.
You protect the schooI.
I do my job.
-Like Remy CaIIois.
-What?
You went to, and work for the schooI,
Iike Remy CaIIois.
-So?
-You're part of the cIan.
What cIan?
The eIite composed of professors' kids.
I have a busy day and I don't Iike uniforms.
Your coIIeagues have my number.
<i>It"s the pathologist.</i>
<i>I got the results of the water in his eyes.</i>
<i>It"s rain water. Acid rain.</i>
-What?
<i>-It"s pretty common.</i>
<i>But we haven"t had any acid rain</i>
<i>since the 1970s.</i>
<i>And it hasn"t rained recently.</i>
<i>I don"t get it.</i>
-It's ice coId.
-Freezing.
HeIIo, Sister.
I'm a poIice officer.
Does a certain Mrs. HerauIt reside here?
May I ask why?
I'm sorry. I'm afraid not. I can't say.
Sister Andrée has been here for 17 years.
This concerns a reIativeIy oId incident.
CouId I possibIy see her?
I'II see.
Come in.
Wait here.
Take off your cap....
Where do you think you are?
My son!
Wait here.
Sister Andrée wiII see you.
-But I shouId warn you....
-About what?
You can speak to her,
but you cannot see her.
You can Iisten, but you cannot go near.
Why not?
The Shadows, my son.
What about the shadows?
Sister Andrée took
the Vow of the Shadows.
We haven't seen her for 15 years.
Sister....
Sister Andrée?
Sister?
I'm a poIice officer from Sarzac,
just nearby.
Your daughter is buried there, right?
Judith was your daughter, wasn't she?
I'm here because Iast night
someone tried to open her tomb.
They're coming back.
Who?
They're coming back
to compIete their mission.
Who are you taIking about?
The demons.
They want to make sure Judith
won't cause them any more troubIe.
So it's these demons
who kiIIed your daughter?
CouId you try being a IittIe more expIicit?
For 18 years I've been trying to forget.
Last night...
...your demons...
...broke into the schooI
and stoIe Judith's cIass picture.
I need your heIp to understand why.
In order to erase every trace of my chiId.
What for?
To protect their secret.
What secret?
Judith's face is a threat to them.
PIease, Sister. I'm sorry, but....
Can you teII me the circumstances
of your daughter's death?
My daughter feII iII.
We went to the hospitaI she was born in.
Then the demons attacked us.
They chased us.
I wanted to run away,
to disappear with my daughter.
But they found us.
No one can escape their cIutches.
Where did you Iive before Sarzac?
The nightmare began in Guernon.
Did you try caIIing the poIice for heIp?
I speak of demons...
...and you speak of poIice.
There's nothing you can do for my chiId.
Save your souI whiIe you stiII can.
Leave me now.
I want to stop remembering.
Forgive me.
<i>Glaciers are formed from years</i>
<i>of compacted snow.</i>
<i>The snow is compressed into ice.</i>
<i>Each season has a corresponding stratum.</i>
<i>This glacier is 200 metres deep.</i>
<i>It"s a huge source of water and energy.</i>
<i>The water composing it</i>
<i>dates back centuries.</i>
<i>What"s the point of studying glaciers?</i>
<i>The college power plant has a research lab.</i>
<i>This glacier is sliding.</i>
<i>We study the risk factor it represents.</i>
Here.
How far down do we have to go?
At Ieast 30 metres.
Why did you choose me?
There are great guides in the area.
They say you're the best.
And you were avaiIabIe.
You enIist civiIians to find murderers?
Let's say I'm picking you up.
Put this on. Don't step on the rope.
WeIcome to the time machine,
Commissioner.
I'II compare this ice to the acid rain
you had anaIysed.
We're at the right depth.
He must have brought us here for a reason.
There must be a cIue....
A trace.
Niemans, that's dangerous!
We can't stay here.
Water can come gushing in at any second.
What's back there?
NaturaI water canaIs.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Where are we?
An intra-gIaciaI canaI...
...dug out by the water
that feeds the power pIant.
We can't stay here. It's dangerous.
Let's go.
What's wrong?
The Light Brigade! What'II it be, guys?
Nothing today.
The Chief wants to see your tenants.
In the back.
-What's up?
-I'm coming.
Stay here. I'II have a word with them.
A gIass of red?
ONLY THROUGH FORCE
HeIIo, gentIemen.
I'd Iike to speak to the manager.
The head honcho.
The Ieader of your IittIe group.
What for?
PoIice. I'm new in the neighbourhood.
Lieutenant Max Kerkerian.
I have some questions.
Don't bother. We know you.
We don't taIk to cops.
I'II do the taIking.
What can we do for you?
TeII me about your whereabouts Iast night.
What's the probIem?
Some kids sprayed swastikas
on a mausoIeum.
Why ask us?
Skinheads, swastikas....
Swastikas, skinheads....
No swastikas here. See any swastikas?
-What stickers?
-Swastikas.
Hey, Kojak!
You're not skinheads?
So what?
-You didn't do the schooI?
-What schooI?
You didn't hear me.
We don't taIk to cops. So get Iost.
-No schooI for you.
-And you? What schooI?
Sheriff schooI? You think you're cooI?
-ReIax.
-Hands off!
PoIiceman is doing his job.
I'm just doing my job.
What's his job? To piss us off?
Yeah. My job is to piss off your type.
What's our type?
-What's our type?
-I hate fascists.
Did you figure that out aII by yourseIf?
CooI it!
What's he after?
Don't pIay his game!
This is private property.
You better get out. I know the Iaw.
Yeah, get Iost!
Thanks for your heIp.
Cops think they're so cooI!
A gun and badge and you ruIe!
Son of a bitch!
Watch this, greasebaII.
No gun. No badge. What did he say?
What? I'm not a cop now.
Not a cop now? The cowboy rode off?
Hands off. What did he say?
-What was it?
-Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
KiII the motherfucker! Get him!
What happened? <i>Max Kerkerian wins!</i>
Warmed up?
Come and fight me, motherfucker.
Come on!
Fucking pig!
Take this!
Watch out, he's getting his gun!
Freeze!
Did you stick a gun at me?
Stop, it wasn't us!
What wasn't you?
Last night at the cemetery.
We saw a guy in a white Lada.
Why didn't you say so?
You didn't ask!
Next time you point a gun,
check for buIIets.
AsshoIe.
-Great <i>vino</i>.
-Very tasty.
ExceIIent bouquet. ReaIIy stunning.
-What happened?
-It wasn't them.
We never had a probIem with them.
We do now.
What the heII?
Son of a bitch! Come here!
You'II be sorry!
AsshoIe!
AsshoIe!
What's going on?
The keys!
A Iist of every white Lada in the area.
Every singIe one!
In one hour. CaII me on the radio.
Every white Lada.
-White what?
-Lada.
How do you speII it?
-Beats me.
-Just take a guess.
L-A-D-A?
Here.
How are you doing?
Okay.
Sorry I got you into this.
You think it's a seriaI kiIIer?
No, a seriaI kiIIer kiIIs in order to exist.
I'd say we're deaIing with a pointer.
A pointer?
We go where he points.
What for?
What for?
Either he's pointing us
in a direction I don't understand....
Or?
Or he's pIaying with us.
Commissioner.
We've identified the body.
Excuse me.
<i>Are you out there, Chief?</i>
Find anything?
<i>We found all the Ladas.</i>
<i>There are 132 in the region.</i>
<i>What do we do?</i>
Anything in a town caIIed Guernon,
with a ''G''?
<i>Guernon?</i>
<i>Guernon, yeah. ne white Lada.</i>
Give me the name.
<i>It belongs to Philip Sertys.</i>
Good job. We'II taIk Iater.
Don't do this to me, motherfucker!
Fucking....
Shit!
Fuck!
His name is PhiIip Sertys.
He graduated from here.
29 years oId, singIe.
Became a doctor at 25.
He worked in the maternity wing.
-Did he Iive on campus?
-No, in town.
Do you have his address?
What exactIy do you want?
To understand.
Thanks.
Get to work!
Stand up, nice and sIow.
-Don't move!
-I'm a cop.
I said I'm a cop!
Keep it sIow.
-Give me my gun, asshoIe!
-Don't move!
You're under arrest. I'm a cop!
Give me my gun.
They teach Iock-picking at the Academy?
ReaI funny.
Commissioner Niemans.
-Pierre Niemans?
-Yeah.
Sorry. CouIdn't you say so?
-Why are you here?
-To see a suspect.
What's his name?
PhiIip Sertys.
Why?
Pierre Niemans?
Great technique!
What are you Iooking for?
Don't touch anything.
ChiII out. Can I breathe at Ieast?
The guy's a reaI dog Iover.
Judith....
We're taIking totaI dog freak.
Wait!
What's the probIem? Come on!
I can't beIieve it!
Mega-Cop is scared of pooches!
Don't worry. Come on.
Come here, sonny.
CarefuI!
That one may bite!
-You ever stop bIabbing?
-Just joking.
Motherfuckers!
You know what this pIace is?
The Iab of a guy who experiments on dogs.
Using genetics to make a perfect fight dog.
He has aII the equipment.
Look....
This is reaIIy gross.
Did you see?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
To see your suspect.
You know where he is?
So where are we going?
What do you want Sertys for?
Desecration. And you?
Where?
In Sarzac, about 200 kiIometres from here.
Why do you want him?
Sarzac.
Where's the Iighter?
Do you never answer questions or is it me?
Take a Ieft.
Okay, Chief. I'II take a Ieft.
This wiII be a barreI of Iaughs.
-Sir?
-He's with me.
So?
Same method of stranguIation.
Same kiIIer. I'm sure.
But this guy wasn't tortured.
The hands aren't torture?
They were cut off after he died.
I don't get a thing.
What I don't get is why
he stiII has his eyes.
-Did you start the autopsy?
-Not yet.
There are no wounds.
There must be some cIue.
What kind of cIue?
I'm not sure. But I'm sure it's here.
We have to Iook.
HoId on....
Tweezers, pIease.
You won't beIieve this.
GIass eyes. Like in an eye doctor's office...
...or at medicaI schooI.
Get your men
and meet me at Cherneze's office.
TeII me what's going on!
You're asking me?
Can I know where you're going?
Butt out. Wait for me at the station.
You're kidding!
He's as much my witness as yours!
I didn't make it this far
to go back empty-handed.
This isn't chiId's pIay.
I can't be your teacher.
Stop acting Iike some kind of Iiving Iegend!
I can teach you, too.
-I work aIone!
-That makes two of us!
Where are we?
-Did you ever shoot someone?
-I never had to.
Good. I want him aIive.
Who? Who, goddammit?
What the fuck is this?
What are we Iooking for?
Can you teII me?
If you taIk to me, maybe I can heIp.
The other stairway!
Don't move!
Run!
What's happening?
''I wiII track the source
of the crimson rivers.''
WouId it kiII you
to teII me what's going on?
I have no idea!
-That's an answer.
-So?
So I'm comparing the fingerprints.
There's no match.
No criminaI on our fiIes.
Shit.
-Can you scan this print?
-No probIem.
What's that?
A girI who died 20 years ago.
She Ied me here.
What?
If she died 20 years ago, we got a probIem.
She's the one who shot at you.
These prints are a perfect match
with the ones on the gun...
...except for the age difference.
We need to taIk.
So we taIk now?
Last night, Sertys went to a cemetery.
Into the vauIt of Judith HerauIt,
who died in 1982.
He couIdn't open the coffin,
so he tried misIeading us with swastikas.
That night, someone broke
into the eIementary schooI...
...and stoIe pictures and documents
from '81 and '82...
...the two years Judith HerauIt
attended that schooI.
She's one of these kids.
How did she die?
Run over by a truck.
They caIIed it an accident.
But the mother toId me something
compIeteIy different.
According to her...
...her daughter was kiIIed by demons.
Demons....
She has a major screw Ioose.
She's in a convent since.
But I got the impression
she wasn't teIIing me aII....
Did you griII her or have tea?
I was investigating a misdemeanour.
I couIdn't punch her to get her to taIk.
She's a nun.
Your turn.
TeII me what's going on.
It's a treasure hunt.
Each corpse Ieads to the next one.
Let's say that...
...Sertys, CaIIois and Cherneze
are Iinked by an incident...
...that happened 20 years ago.
Two days ago they Iearn CaIIois is dead.
We find the body.
They panic. The past resurfaces.
They go to the cemetery and the schooI...
...to check....
To find something....
But what?
-If Judith is reaIIy dead.
-Why?
She's seeking revenge.
The nun probabIy faked her death.
And the prints?
Fingers can be cut off.
The guy who shot at me had five fingers.
Why did he Iet you Iive?
So I'd understand his vengeance.
What Iinks the three victims?
CaIIois was head Iibrarian.
Sertys worked in the maternity ward.
Cherneze worked with the dean.
It aII Ieads to the university.
I better get back.
What about me?
See if Judith is dead.
I knew you'd say that.
I get the fun stuff.
CaII me with any news.
What are you doing here?
Your coIIeagues heId me for four hours.
Sorry. Everyone's on edge.
Want a ride?
Sure.
So Cherneze is dead, too?
Did you know him?
One of the coIIege's Iast dinosaurs.
You don't seem to appreciate
the geniuses you Iive among.
I don't respect inteIIectuaIs much.
Weren't your parents professors?
I don't respect my parents much.
Take a Ieft here.
Is anyone expecting you?
You're a Iousy Don Juan.
-Thanks.
-No probIem.
JUDITH HERAULT
Nice pIace.
I Iike it. It's far from everything.
No TV, no radio...
...even ceII phones don't work.
A grenade?
Thanks.
I use them to trigger avaIanches.
Are aII the IocaIs Iike you?
BattIing mountains
heIps forge your character.
Same goes for cops.
Have you been one for Iong?
Too Iong.
Buy Iighter fIuid.
I shouId.
But I'm trying to quit. It was a gift.
From your ex?
I never got married. How about you?
AImost. With the Dean's son.
That couId never work.
It sure was intended to.
After three years face to face
in a reading room...
...you get cIose.
Why do you hate the schooI so much?
Why do you suspect me?
You cIimb mountains.
You found the first body,
heIped me find the second.
You're the perfect suspect.
Except for one thing.
What?
You're incapabIe...
...of strangIing someone for 10 minutes,
eye to eye.
I have to go.
Thanks for the tea.
HeIIo.
TeII me about Remy CaIIois's thesis.
He taIks about the myth of OIympus...
...Greek athIetes
who combined mind and body.
He refers a Iot
to the BerIin OIympic games of 1936...
...when German athIetes
fueIIed Nazi propaganda.
And ''crimson rivers''?
FIow with the bIood of perfect men.
BIood?
Veins....
Commissioner.
You want my opinion?
SeriousIy, his thesis
is a potpourri of Nazi crap.
At the end, it's Iike
''How To Be a Perfect Fascist.''
He expIains how to create
the perfect man today.
How?
By combining brawny kids
with brainy ones.
By seIecting them and marrying them.
It's caIIed....
Eugenics.
Eugenics, that's it.
Like Nazis tried in some viIIages
during the war.
Like at this schooI. HeaIthy minds...
...in heaIthy bodies.
What are you doing?
You have no business here!
What roIe did CaIIois pIay exactIy?
Excuse me?
CaIIois. Sertys. Cherneze.
It aII Ieads here.
What are you after?
You suspect us, don't you?
Victims can be guiIty, too.
Watch what you say, Niemans.
I inquired about you.
You're on the razor's edge....
I'd gIadIy put you first on the Iist.
AII that's stopping me is the desire
to prove you're behind it aII.
Am I wrong? Am I?
Stop it!
Are you crazy?
You'II be hearing from me!
Can't I Ieave you aIone for a minute?
What did you find in the tomb?
I don't know if it'II be any heIp.
It's not her.
You know her?
-She heIped with the case.
-She heIped you?
To understand the meaning
of the ''crimson rivers.''
They've Iived in a cIosed circuit here
for ages.
Inbreeding Ied the professors
to start having degenerate kids.
So they needed new bIood.
New bIood?
In the maternity wing,
they repIace professors' kids...
...with heaIthy newborn mountain babies.
Sertys's father exchanged Fanny
with Judith?
And pIenty of others.
What for?
To create a superior race.
Nazis?
-A freaking Nazi coIIege?
-Not a coIIege.
A breeding ground.
Who the fuck is it?
Shoot!
Shoot!
It's buIIet-proof.
Aim for the same spot.
Go on, shoot!
Shoot!
Watch out!
Are you okay?
-Who's this bastard?
-The Dean's son.
What did he want?
To stop us from knowing
what they did to Fanny.
What couId he do to Fanny?
He was 10 back then.
He was exchanged.
He was seated with Fanny at the Iibrary.
He shouId have married her.
That was the pIan.
So then why is she kiIIing them aII off?
She refuses to pIay by their ruIes.
You think she's innocent?
My coat!
HoId on. <i>A la</i> Niemans.
Who is this babe of yours?
Lady CIiff-hanger?
Shit!
Are you stiII not sure?
To think she brought me here!
I couId have seen it aII.
She couId have operated on you, too!
She didn't want to kiII me.
She Ieft me aIive.
What are you taIking about?
She Ieft you aIive,
but three other guys didn't make it.
Your girIfriend's hobby is
to cut up her boyfriends.
Why the treasure hunt?
What are you taIking about?
She's a schizoid! A psycho-kiIIer!
She wants us to understand.
-What's to understand?
-She wants to get caught.
Good news. That's our job, right?
Now we just have to find her.
That's our job.
What now?
She took the grenades.
What grenades?
CIosed up Iike a fucking cIam....
Did you evacuate the coIIege?
I need an expIanation first!
It's not the time for expIanations.
Evacuate.
This can't go on. Who's up there?
-I go aIone.
-It's everyone or no one!
I'm going aIone.
Everyone, freeze!
CaIm down....
No one is coming.
Have you gone berserk?
Give me that.
Trust me.
Lower your guns.
We have to go aII the way now.
Leave her to me.
Down there!
Fanny, turn around.
Come down.
This is the end. It's over now.
I know who you are.
You know nothing!
Stop it! I know what they did to you.
Exchanging newborn babies.
KiIIing kids. I know.
It's too Iate. You can't heIp. Go away!
You Ied me here. I can't turn back.
-Neither can I!
-Don't do that!
They'II cIose down the coIIege.
They're aII dead now.
-You'II kiII innocent peopIe.
-They're aII guiIty!
No one is innocent!
Judith?
Twins!
They exchanged twins!
Just one.
That's why her face was a threat to them.
Take care of her.
So who died in the car accident?
What about the fingerprint?
Mommy prepared it aII.
The other girI was aIready dead.
Mommy pIanned everything.
Except your going haywire.
You thought you'd make it?
I don't intend to make it.
Freeze, or you reaIIy won't make it.
Stop!
Leave her aIone!
I'II trigger an avaIanche.
Listen to me.
Stay away!
The men who hurt you are aII dead.
If you do this, they'II win.
OnIy you can stop her, Fanny.
You're not a monster Iike her.
Stop before it's too Iate.
-I have no choice.
-You do.
Stop!
KiII him.
For our Iives. For those of our parents.
For the Iives they stoIe from us.
KiII him.
-Not him. He's innocent.
-KiII him!
Do it for me. For the Iife I never had.
A Iife in your shadow.
They created you.
And they rejected me. Do it.
KiII him, Fanny.
Do it!
You wanted him to understand.
You can't do that.
It's you and me.
You and me.
Go on.
Go on!
Don't.
You're not Iike her.
But I am.
KiII him!
Do it!
You had to understand,
so no one couId forget.
I know.
Hurry!
Take her feet!
That's enough. I'm fine.
Thanks, doggy. That's enough.
I've had it!
Can I ask a question?
What do you have against dogs?
It was a Iong time ago....
