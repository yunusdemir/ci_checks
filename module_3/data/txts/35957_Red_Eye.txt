Hello, my name is Gage Barker,
and I have gathered
a group of friends to
go to Black Creek Hills,
West Virginia to do
a documentary on the local
legend called Red Eye.
It has always been
a dream of mine to...
Gage, can't you put that
damn thing away for once
and help me load this
shit in the trunk?
Where's that di...
I mean, boyfriend of yours?
Late as usual, but if you're
not gonna put that away,
why not let me try it out?
Filming?
Yeah, experience is key.
Uh, sure.
Remind me later and
I'll let you do a scene.
Dork.
Jake.
Come on.
Jake.
No, no, stop, stop.
This isn't right, not
when you're with Rykyr.
She is a good friend of mine,
I don't wanna mess this up.
Once was enough.
Since when did you start
caring about that crusty cunt?
Shouldn't you?
She is your girlfriend.
You know what?
That night, the party, was
the worst mistake of my life.
Please, you were
begging for it.
I know how you bitches get.
You get jealous, but no worries.
There's enough room
down here to share.
Such an asshole.
Hey Rykyr, can
you pop the truck open?
I need to take my medicine.
Rykyr, hello?
Rykyr?
What, can't
you see I'm jamming here?
Can you pop the
trunk open please?
What are
you doing back there?
Hiding a dead
hooker or something?
Oh, nice one.
Thank you.
Hey, Ry, you okay?
Gage, you filmin'?
Action.
Rykyr, turn that down a sec.
Fuck no
Gage, this is my shit.
Oh come on
man, what the fuck?
I need to
record some voice overs
for the opening of
the documentary.
I have the paper here somewhere.
Ah, alright.
So feel free to chime in.
I want this to feel real.
Jake, on my action,
ask me what the legend
is behind Red Eye, okay?
Whatever.
Action.
What's the
legend behind Red Eye?
During the years
of the Great Depression,
many families left their
homes to seek work.
But this certain family
had no way to travel.
But dude, why
is his name Red Eye?
I mean?
Let me finish,
and I will explain.
Winter was approaching
and the numbers of animals
to hunt decreased.
The father and the mother
came to an agreement
that the only way to
survive was to consume
the flesh of the children.
Are you
fucking serious?
How'd the kill them?
Morbid, much?
Their meat
only lasted them so long
because of how frail they were.
Soon, the father
killed the mother for
the same reason he
killed his daughters.
The thirst for blood only grew
and could be merely
satisfied by ravaging
any living thing that
crossed his path.
His blood consumption
was so severe,
it turned his right eye red,
hence the name Red Eye.
Bull
fucking shit, dude.
What'd you do?
Copy this from somewhere?
It's the worst intro
ever, I swear to god.
It took me a
while to write all that.
Dick.
I tried to make it professional.
I thought it was good.
Really creepy.
Well I mean,
your execution could have
been better, dude.
It sounded pretty plain.
Ah, I must have
consulted Miss Know-It-All
Rykyr Jacobs before doing
the opening for my film.
Chill down,
I'm just sayin', gosh.
He's still rumored
to lurk in the backwoods
of Black Creek, West Virginia.
Of course he is.
Well, what better place to go.
Right guys?
Yeah, sure.
How much further Gage?
I believe
we keep on this road
for a few miles more.
Then we have some hiking
to the actual location.
Wake up.
Jesus.
We're almost
there, we're almost there.
Yes.
You said
that an hour ago.
I know,
but I promise guys,
we are really almost there.
Sex, drugs, and
rock 'n roll, baby.
Damn straight.
Come on, Ryann,
I love this song!
Guys, how old were you when
you went to your first show?
I was like 12, I think.
Nine.
15.
Aw man, lame.
Well I've never
been to one, so.
Dude, what he fuck?
We have such sights to show you.
Nice, babe.
Who the hell would
live out his far anyway?
Probably some
pick up truck driving
chicken fuckers.
Would you fuck chickens?
They're obviously
serial killers, Ryann.
Don't you watch
any horror films?
I guess it's not first
preference of mine.
Well just wait
until we get back home.
I'm gonna school
you on a few films.
You don't want
Ryann to shit the bed.
Well, I just feel like
I have a whole world
to introduce her to.
I'm just gonna take your
hand and walk through it all.
Well I'm down
for anything, so.
Lesbo alert.
Hey, you're gonna
make a right up here.
Okay.
What is that?
It looks like
someone's broke down.
Jake, pull over.
Are you serious?
We're in the middle
of butt-fuck nowhere.
How can you be sure it's
not some backwoods hillbilly
with a double barrel
shotgun in their trunk?
Seriously, Jake?
More like a crossbow
or a hunting knife.
Just
pull over, come on.
Oh god, this
is not a good idea.
Be careful.
Don't die.
He'll be the
one to get the freaking
crossbow to his head.
For sure.
But I hope not.
Otherwise, this was
a huge waste of time
and we have no documentary.
Oh god.
Guys, are we sure Gage
knows where he's going?
Well, he was down here
a few weeks ago scouting
to see if the internet
bullshit was legit.
I don't think it's too
much further up the road.
God, I'm getting a
fucking scanner's headache
from this heat.
Alright.
Come on, let's check on him.
I think there might be something
wrong with your battery.
Just my luck.
You haven't been out
here long have you?
No, not too long.
Well, maybe my
friends and I can get
you back up and running.
I would really
appreciate that.
Hi.
I'm Bea.
Thank you guys so
much for stoppin'.
It's been miles since I've
seen a soul around these parts
which isn't too uncommon.
Isn't it ironic that I
broke down just a couple
miles from my house?
Silly me.
So that was your
house back there?
A few miles up the road?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, why on Earth do you live
so far out in the country?
Rykyr told you already.
- Weren't you listen...
- Jake.
When my parents
passed away they left me
the house to care for my
younger brother, Barry.
He's autistic.
It's just us now.
I thank the man above
that you guys happened
to be traveling
through when you did.
Where are you all from?
You all don't look like a local.
Yeah no.
We're actually all
from around Pittsburgh.
Like three hours away.
No, it's like two and a half.
Yeah.
Wow.
What y'all doin' down here?
Well you know, we
thought we'd just come in
for a good old hoe-down.
Oh really?
Why of course.
We gotta saddle up the
mule and gather the...
Excuse Jake.
He likes to be a dick
most, I mean, all the time.
Yeah.
Anyways, we're out
here doing a documentary
on Red Eye for a film festival.
Really?
No one ever comes around
these parts doing anything
like that.
Y'all must be like the
celebrities I watch on
television every night.
Well, not yet anyways.
But, being a legend and all,
do you know anything about it?
Oh yeah.
Barry could tell you every
detail, right to a tee.
Growing up, our daddy
used to tell us stories
every night at bed time
about big old Red Eye.
Barry never quite got over him.
Have either of you seen him?
You know, as a matter of fact,
there was this one time.
I was downstairs finishing
up on the gardening,
and Barry was upstairs.
And while he just started
hootin' and hollerin',
I run on up those
stairs and he's yelling,
pointing at the window.
And he swears that he
saw a big, tall burly man
over yonder wearing overalls
and a sack upon his head.
Well that poor boy was
freaking out so much
that I ran downstairs
and ran over there
trying to track him
down, and all I found
were bloody footprints.
We had to cover up that window.
Barry can't look
out of it anymore.
He still flips out to this day.
It's real unfortunate we
don't live closer to town.
Well, too bad Barry
isn't here to film
an actual scene for you, Gage.
Probably the only
exciting thing you'll film
on this damn trip.
Every town has
its legends Jake, come on.
Oh it ain't no legend.
If y'all had seen the
look on Barry's face,
you wouldn't be poking fun
at it, that's for sure.
Y'all just promise
me one thing, though.
You promise me that
you'll be real careful.
If you scream, no
one's gonna hear you.
And if you get lost,
you're lost.
And if you get hurt,
I hope you know first aid.
Oh, and most important,
there's no phone tower
in Black Creek.
So whatever happens to y'all,
it's your own fault.
Jesus.
It's okay, darlin',
I do live just up
down the street.
Up Black Creek Hills?
Yes, sir.
Your spark plug
was loose.
Look at that.
Aren't you useful?
Well thank you guys
so much for your help.
I really do appreciate it.
Now, remember what I said,
y'all just be real careful.
Or else big old Red
Eye might have got ya.
Aren't you late to a hoe-down?
Bye y'all.
Hey.
She's one of the pick up
truck driving chicken fuckers.
You're such a dick.
Oh boo-fucking-hoo.
Don't think I didn't notice
why she didn't hug me.
That's a pretty
neat talent to somehow
make everything about you, Jake.
Oh babe, it's all natural.
God.
I swear to god, man.
If I see an abandoned pick up
truck on the side of the road,
I am out.
What is the fun in that?
Live a little.
I'm living, just
as long as that shit
don't go down.
Why?
What does that mean?
Is that an omen or something?
It's just like a
reference, Ryann.
Jake, stop up here.
By my research, this
looks to be right around
the place the killings happened.
We may have to walk a
little bit south, but,
the exact location ain't
far from here at all.
How the fuck can you tell
in the middle of the woods?
Research buddy.
Alright, I guess we're
doing the unpacking.
You've researched
something that isn't
100% proven to be true.
Man, Jake likes to
pick a lot, doesn't he?
Yeah.
He can be an ass, but,
he's my ass, so I learn to deal.
It happened.
- Oh, did it?
- Yeah.
How'd you come to know
of this legend anyways?
Well, she always used to
tell me the story when I went
and stayed with some family
a couple of counties back.
You two have a connection?
Well, he loves horror
and I wanna be in it, so.
Be in it?
Yeah, you know, like
acting, filming, and writing.
Ah, I gotcha.
I was intrigued with it
ever since I was a kid.
So, when I did my research
and found that the legend
was actually kind of real,
what better way to start
my film project with?
He loves 'em like me
but I'm just not exactly
sure what he's gonna be doing.
I just wish he'd be a
little bit more motivated
and cooperative, you know?
I have to admit,
it is pretty sick.
And, to be fair, I
didn't know all of that.
Well, if you cared
about something besides
yourself for once.
I care about lots of things.
Like my beautifully
twisted girlfriend.
What do you want?
Nothin' but your love, babe.
Oh my god, I am so sorry.
Sorry, Jake.
We've reached our
final destination, hell.
No, seriously.
We've reached our
destination Red Eye.
We are hoping that these
are the exact locations
that the murders took place.
Aren't you guys excited?
This is the place.
Sounds interesting, Gage.
Rykyr, I know you
gotta be excited.
Well, Gage, we've been
hiking for fucking ever.
Maybe we could have
done this when it wasn't
200 fucking degrees
outside, dude.
It's not that much longer.
I've been scouting out
this location for a while.
I'm like, drenched in sweat.
Well, if you
girls get too hot,
feel free to take off on
any excessive clothing.
You're a class act, Jake.
Well I'm sure
Gage would agree.
You could even film it.
Talk about a nice
bonus scene to choke
your chicken to.
- Faggot.
- Asshole.
- Fucker.
- Turd.
Weirdo.
Hey now, we are the weirdos
mister, chill it down.
Jerk off.
Repeat, you lose.
Dammit Rykyr, you
made me lose focus.
Well excuse me for
trying to prevent
another childish
charade between you two.
You guys are a riot, I swear.
And you're a pain in my ass.
Did you guys hear about
the couple that got arrested
for torturing and eating
two of their classmates
who bullied them?
I read it on the
internet the other day.
I guess you could
say karma was served?
Get it?
That's beyond disgusting.
What, Rykyr?
It's nothing.
Did you see it?
It was a pretty sick article.
No use reminding me of
shit I could relate to.
Relate?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
I'm pretty sure
you're not a cannibal.
Tons of assholes.
You didn't stand out enough
to be a target, Ryann.
A target?
Well, target's a
nice way of putting it.
I mean, I was just always
bullied for being different
and doing the darker
side of things.
I was never accepted
or understood.
Until you met me, right?
What happened?
Why haven't I heard
about this before?
It's just nothing
to be mentioned.
Way better forgotten.
I'm sorry.
Remember that dick
Bill I had to rough up?
He was such as asshole.
All of them were.
All jock faggots are.
All they do is it
in the locker room
and suck each other off.
You know, Bill, I remember
he came up to me in bio
one day and I was wearing
my Leatherface belt buckle.
I actually think I went to
the front of the classroom
to like sharpen my
pencil or some shit and,
he looked at me and said
"What the fuck is that?"
This is why I kicked his ass.
And I was like, "Dude,
it's Leatherface."
Ane he said, "You know,
you're never gonna have
"any friends, or a
boyfriend, when you like
"that stupid shit."
God, I'm so sorry.
Don't be, it's just your
classic judgmental assholes.
I mean, god forbid
dressing or doing something
against the tide.
You know, just better known
as being your own person.
That's so messed up.
But you know, that's one
of the reasons why I always
admired you in school.
You were never afraid
to be different,
be your own person.
And you were accepting
and not judgmental.
That's definitely a
trait most people our age
cannot comprehend.
But you know, it's
just bullshit.
I mean, I'm a firm believer
in not judging people
from what's on the outside.
You should be able to look
like whatever the fuck
you want, dress however
the fuck you want,
and not just try to fit
in to be the American
cookie cutter ideal, or
what's considered beautiful
because everyone's beautiful.
I absolutely agree.
That it really inspiring Rykyr.
My babe's a tough one.
But then, on top of it all,
having druggies as parents
didn't help the matters any.
They would do
anything to get a high
and could care less
about how I was feeling.
I just think, it's all
the shit and shitty people
are what can make
a person, you know?
I didn't let it hold me back.
One of the reasons
why I love you.
You know, I honestly
do, how did you guys end
up together?
Besides your guys' likes, you
guys are totally different.
Well that's easy.
I'm sexy, she's sexy,
we're even sexier together.
Perfect.
I can't say I disagree.
How did you guys end
up meeting anyways?
We actual met at this
hole-in-the-wall video store.
Yeah, we bumped hands
because we were reaching
for the same film.
You know, the formula to
a romantic movie shit.
And that film is still one
of my favorites to this day.
Which was it?
The one with the
chick with the dick.
Such a classic.
Oh god, that's disgusting.
Dude, what the fuck is that?
Babe, get the
fuck away from that thing.
Get that on camera, Gage?
You know it.
Badass.
You are so funny.
Come on, Ryann,
loosen up some.
Beneath our feet is the
very ground that Red Eye
prayed upon his victims in
his blood craved rampage.
He must be here.
What the fuck man?
This is it, Jake, this.
Aren't you guys excited?
I can say I am.
This is fucking rad,
let's camp here.
That's the excitement
I'm looking for.
Learn from Rykyr.
Oh come on, babe.
I mean, we're staying where
an iconic slasher legend
killed his victims.
It's like staying at
the Amityville House
or Lizzie Borden house.
I got you babe.
The thing is, I love watching
them, not semi-living them.
Don't be such a pussy.
I don't know guys.
It is kind of creepy.
Gage.
So we're just staying
one night, right?
Yeah, I figured it'd be
easier to do it all tomorrow
instead of one day, you know?
Yeah.
Fuck this motherfucker!
Why does this have to
be so goddamn difficult?
Read the
directions, Jake.
I don't speak gibberish man.
It's Spanish, and
that's the wrong side.
Nevermind.
Guys, you know I can help.
As long as I get to
stay in there with ya.
No, we're gonna take
the sleeping bags.
Let the girls take the tent.
We don't need to hear your
famous moaning anyways.
Famous?
It's known to have its charms.
You should know.
Whatever.
Hey, Ry.
What you readin'?
Just a novel.
It was my favorite
in high school.
Oh.
It's about this girl.
She lives in a world
of lies and stuff
and she finds out
the truth and learns
how to overcome it.
Ah.
You just have to read it.
Well I'm more of a
film buff, not a reader.
Maybe you just need
to find something
you can relate to.
Rykyr, get your ass over here.
You know what?
Why don't you and Ryann
go and get some firewood?
Man, that was a bitchy throw.
Fuck off Gage.
Go and do something useful.
Useless twat.
Why'd they get
volunteered for wood duty?
I have enough wood
for the both of us.
Besides, I had to get
that slut and cocksucker
out of our hair for a bit.
What the hell, Jake?
Fuck off!
Why do you have to be
such a fucking bitch?
So how long have you
and Jake been sneaking around?
Jake?
I see the way you look at him
and the way he looks at you.
It's quite obvious.
Why Jake though?
Why even chance to hurt Rykyr?
I don't want to
hurt Rykyr, okay?
I just can't help it.
As my judgemental, overpaid
therapist always says,
I've been numb to my
personal emotions and others.
I need to learn to
deal with my past,
let my soul heal and
finally break free from
numbing my emotions.
She says it's my mind's way
of coping with what happened.
What happened?
When I saw the
opportunity to be with him,
I just couldn't refuse.
I just wanted to feel
something, anything, again.
What do you mean again?
Ryann, you can tell me.
It's hard to say, okay?
I was sexually abused by
my father until I was 13.
He threatened to kill my
mom if I ever told anyone.
I zone out all my emotions.
Especially love.
I guess I never fully recovered.
I'm so sorry, Ryann.
Don't you still live
with your mom, though?
Just to survive.
I'm trying to save
up enough money
so I can move out
and live on my own.
My dad's been in prison now
for a while on manslaughter.
You know my mom thinks
I made this all up?
That I said it because
I don't like him
or because I wanted him gone?
She's always loved
him way more than she
could ever love me.
Regardless, it's no
excuse for what I've done.
If I could take
everything back, I would.
I regret it so, so much.
I just,
want to love.
To be loved.
You can find love,
just not with Jake.
He's taken.
Jake isn't the one you want.
I honestly feel bad
for Rykyr sometimes.
It's too late now.
It doesn't matter.
What do you mean?
I'm usually safe.
I don't know what the
hell I was thinking.
I sleep around.
I do it because
I'm trying to find
some sense of emotion.
So, I jump from guy to guy,
just trying to feel
love, fall in love.
But nothing works.
You can find someone,
you just have to...
Gage, I'm two months pregnant.
Is it Jake's?
I want to tell him, I
just, I don't know how.
But he can be so
immature sometimes,
I don't know how
he's gonna react.
And then,
Rykyr.
I don't know.
Honestly, I'm only
here on this trip because
I'm trying to find some
way to tell him, and her,
that I'm keeping it.
Are you sure it's Jake's?
I mean, you said
you get around...
He's the only guy I've
slept with without a condom.
Talk about a bad decision.
You know what?
That fire isn't gonna
make itself, come on.
We're back.
About damn time.
Anything
else I can help with?
Go grab the lighter.
Check.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm going pee.
Need someone
to hold your hand?
You get any good shots today?
Yeah, the lady we ran
into earlier was fantastic
and you shot it quite well.
Would you mind doing
this thing for me?
Yeah, what do you mean, act?
Yeah, whatever.
Just say your name,
where you are.
Just wing it.
Well...
And,
action.
Well hello, my
name's Rykyr Jacobs
and I'm 20 years old and I'm
here in the middle of the woods
to see if an old
folklore is true.
How could it
not by that shit story
Gage told us earlier?
And with an asshole.
Is it fact or fake?
Are the stories true?
Was blood really spilled
right where we're sitting?
That's what we're
here to find out.
If he is here, with us.
Keep an eye out for Red Eye.
Who knows where he's lurking.
Wow.
Thanks, that was awesome.
Are you sure?
I can do it, like,
faster, or creepier,
or anything you want.
That's what she said.
Jake?
Gage? Rykyr?
You guys aren't
trying to scare me
for your movie again are you?
Guys?
No but seriously,
Gage, I'm fucking bored.
Not a damn thing has happened.
I thought you said
this sounded pretty sick.
It was, until I sat
here for four hours
watching grass grow.
Ryann!
Oh my god, Ryann!
Who the fuck leaves
live traps out here
in the middle of nowhere?
We have to get her help.
She'll bleed out if we don't
keep her wound compressed.
It'll be okay.
Fuck, give me your keys.
Where are you going?
Where do you
think I'm going, dipshit?
To get us back to the car.
Let me go with you.
No, keep her
calm, I'll be back.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck!
What the fuck happened, Rykyr?
The car wouldn't start,
and there's this guy
with a bat wrapped
in barbed wire.
Jesus fucking Christ, Rykyr.
Just when the attention's
off you and on Ryann.
She needs our help!
I'm not fucking joking!
He was standing right
in front of the car
with a mask on his face.
You knew the legend
was real, didn't you?
Didn't you?
This all your fault.
You put our lives in
danger just for your
lame ass documentary.
Don't you ever
fucking threaten me!
You don't know how
much this means to me!
This is my passion, don't
fucking touch my shit!
You guys heard that crazy lady.
We came out here
on our own risk.
I told you, this shit happened.
Guys, cut it out.
Please.
There is no legend of Red Eye.
I was fucking stupid, and
stepped in a live trap.
That's it.
He's real, Ryann, I saw.
The fact is, Gage knew.
You fuck!
You knew it wasn't
safe out here.
We have
to get out here now.
What about our stuff?
Fuck it.
Help her in the car.
I guess I really
messed up this friendly
get together, huh?
Are you kidding?
You actually made it
pretty interesting.
I mean, I haven't
seen Jake this upset
since the remake of...
Rykyr.
What now?
Me and Gage are
gonna go back to Bea's.
There's no way she
can get that far.
Get in the back seat
and lock the doors.
Are you fucking stupid?
Jake, I can't.
No.
I am not letting you
go out there alone
with that thing you saw.
I have Gage.
We have no other choice, Jake.
Ryann needs you.
Do something for once, please.
If anything happens to
her, it's all on you, man.
I'm trusting you to protect her.
You'll be okay, babe.
Let's go.
I don't fucking understand.
One minute it was
all fine and peachy,
and then this happens.
It's like a fucking horror film.
This shit doesn't just happen.
Are you sure you're okay?
It just hurts a lot.
It'll be okay.
We'll all be okay.
It's just shit
luck on a shit trip
in the shitty documentary.
Why'd you agree to do
this if it's so shitty?
I don't know.
I was bored.
Really, Jake?
I know I give
Gage a hard time.
It's just, it's not that
shitty of a project.
I'm here because...
Because what?
Because you guys have been
friends since grade school?
Yeah I guess.
I don't know.
It's just, he has this
passion and he's doing it.
Like, awesome for him.
It's a good trait to have.
But you could do the
same thing, Jake.
I was always told what I
would be doing after graduation.
I had my whole life
planned out for me.
It wasn't until they passed
when I started to lose myself.
Your parents have passed?
What?
You lost your parents?
No, no.
No, um, do we have any
water bottles in here?
Jake.
Fuck.
That just sort of
came out, didn't it?
I don't talk about it much.
Or at all.
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.
It was a few years
ago, before I met Rykyr.
I was under suicide watch
for about seven months.
Now I live with my grandma, who,
barely knows what's
going on half the time.
And I'm practically taking
care of her until she dies.
Jake.
We all have our baggage.
We endure different things,
but it makes us stronger.
You're strong.
You're living.
It's just Gage he, he
makes it look so easy.
I guess you could say
I'm a little envious.
So learn from his actions.
You can do anything you want.
You just have to try
and never give up.
Yeah, I guess.
Jake.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what came over me.
You're not into this
sort of thing, are you?
What sort of thing?
You know, horror
films, headbanging music.
I mean, you decided to come
with us at the last minute.
What changed your mind?
Nothing changed my mind.
Honestly.
Horror and all
this is new to me.
I...
I've known Rykyr since
junior year of high school.
She was always so good to me.
And the way she carried herself.
Never cared what other
people thought about her.
I don't know.
It just really inspired me.
It makes me wanna be around her.
That's when we started
dating, junior year.
Being with her makes me
wanna be a full person.
You are pretty cool, Ryann.
How much further
is this damn place?
It didn't seem this far
when we passed it earlier.
Gage, fuck, are you not worried?
We all deal with
things differently.
I fucking get that,
dude, but I figured you'd
be a little bit more adamant
with the current situation
and that damn camera.
Passion never ceases, Rykyr.
Ryann will be fine,
just calm down.
I don't see how you are calm.
There's some person fucking
creeping around the woods
wearing some fucked up mask.
How are you not scared, Gage?
I am scared, okay?
I'm scared for Ryann,
I'm scared for us,
and I'm scared for whatever
you saw outside the car.
This is my way of
coping with things.
My escape.
I hope Gage isn't doing
anything fucking stupid.
Jake.
I know, it's just, I
want everything to be okay.
I want Rykyr to be okay and you.
If he lets anything
happen to her,
I'll do more than burn
his fucking camera.
Gage is sweet.
I trust him
I'm sure he's already
found that lady
and is getting help.
I hope.
I know we left off
on the wrong foot.
No.
You don't need to
be apologizing.
If anyone should be
apologizing, it should be me.
For the way I've been acting.
Ryann, what's wrong?
I missed my period.
Okay, and?
Jake.
Uh, how far along are you?
Eight weeks.
Are you sure?
Like 100% positive?
I'm sure.
What are you gonna do with it?
I'm not fit to be a father.
Are you implying I
should get an abortion?
I finally perceive
a sense of love
and you want to take
that away from me?
- Ryann, I...
- Are you fucking serious?
I wanna give this child
the love and affection
that I never had growing up.
Don't you get it?
God.
Why are you always
such a fucking dick?
I really think we're close.
We passed her house right as
we came down this hill earlier.
Shit, there it is!
Her house?
Yeah, come on!
Bea!
Are you home?
Bea, we need your help!
Please.
Bea!
Our friend was
hurt, are you home?
Bea!
Bea?
I don't think anyone's here.
Well what the fuck are
we supposed to do, Gage?
I don't see you doing
anything useful.
I'm sorry.
It's just, what the fuck
are we supposed to do now?
We both know what will happen
if we don't do something.
There isn't anything
we can do here.
There has to be a way we
can slow down the bleeding
until we find some help.
Come on.
I hope so, this
place is fucking dead.
She should be fine now.
I don't think her
wound was too terrible.
We can all go for help.
We'll find someone
sooner or later.
Wouldn't it have just
been better to keep on
until we found someone, Gage?
Well if I remember
correctly, the last house
before Bea's was
a few miles more.
I just don't feel
comfortable leaving Jake
and Ryann out for so long.
Especially with whatever
you saw running around.
Yeah, I guess I agree.
Besides the train wreck
this has turned into,
what's the bigger picture, Gage?
Bigger picture?
Yeah.
I know in school you wanted
to get into actual filmmaking.
Yeah, it's something
I've dreamed of ever since
I was a kid.
I was really excited
to come out here
and do this project
with you guys.
Well you can do it even
if this is a shit storm.
The clips you did in TV
workshop were super killer.
Even if they did get you sent
to the principal's office.
Yeah.
What about you?
Shitty job just to feed myself
and pay my own rent.
The bigger picture?
You know, I'd love to do
something for the industry,
sort of like what you're doing.
I just believe, if you
love something enough
and you push yourself to
achieve it, you'll kill it.
Passion conquers all.
I can see that.
Especially the
aspect of horror fans
making horror to give back.
It's what you're doing
and it's what I've
dreamt of doing since I
saw my first genre flick
back when I was a kid.
It's surreal to
even try to do it.
I mean, I obviously just
came here to kick ass
and chew bubblegum with you.
Yeah, well, we are
all out of bubblegum.
What the fuck?
Gage, what the?
Ryann?
Jake?
Ryann!
Wake up.
Gage, please help me.
At least she isn't
suffering anymore.
Gage?
Our friend was just
fucking murdered
and you're saying she's
not suffering anymore?
There's some sick fuck
trying to kill us!
Jake!
Jake!
Gage, come on!
Rykyr, Ryker.
Are you okay?
Fuck.
We need to hurry
the hell out of here.
Where's Ryann and Gage?
Babe?
Where are they?
Where are they?
Jake, that sick
bastard killed her.
What?
No.
You sick fuck!
Where are you?
Come and get me!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Jake, what are you doing?
It's not gonna bring her back.
I love you.
I'm just so scared.
We just have to stay
strong and find help, okay?
We're gonna bring justice
to her and definitely
give that sick freak
what he deserves.
I'll do more than that.
You motherfucker!
Jake!
Jake, get up please, Jake!
Jake, get up, please.
Get up.
Jake!
Jake, get up!
Jake!
Jake, get up!
Jake, Jake, please.
Oh my god, Gage, we gotta go.
Now that,
that was fucking brilliant.
You were laying on the
fucking ground when
his head popped off, and his
body laying on top of you.
Woo!
How perfect was that?
Bravo, bravo.
Goddamn.
Go get that bitch.
Fuck this shit.
I'm killing both
these sick fucks.
This is my film.
I call the shots.
Now,
you're ready for your
close up, scream queen.
Fuck you.
Do it.
I quite enjoy your screaming.
It turns me on actually.
This shit is sure
to win first place.
Why are you doing this, Gage?
Oh fucking why?
This is where my
passion bleeds through.
Why do such a sick thing, hm?
Everybody loves a good murder,
provided they're not
the victim, of course.
You should know that.
You're killing your friends
for some sick fucking film?
You're never gonna
get away with this.
I think I already have.
It took me years of planning,
and working at a
shitty part time job
to make this happen.
Didn't take much to keep
your parents fucking quiet
and making you gone for good.
Drugs can really
fuck with their mind.
What they would do for
just one last, little fix.
And Jake, his parents
are dead, so nobody gives
a fuck about him.
Shut the fuck up Gage!
He was also busy
sticking his dick in places
it didn't belong, too.
Stop lying.
I'm just stating
the facts, dear.
Jake was the cause of his
parents' death and Ryann.
He was fucking her.
Got her knocked up, too.
And I should say.
I should give myself a little
bit more credit for her.
I got two deaths out
of her instead of one.
She wasn't fit to be
a parents anyways.
It's not true, his parents
died in a car accident.
It had nothing to do with him.
Why wouldn't he lie?
I mean, killing your parents,
that's an all new low.
I mean, I don't even
think I would go that far.
And for Jake,
it was a freak accident caused
by him being a fucking idiot.
And Ryann, her parents.
Dad is a jailhouse pervert
and her crusty ass mom
still loves him more than her.
Oh.
I hope I didn't upset you.
Oh, you should be honored.
Why?
You said you wanted to contribute
to the industry, babe.
Said you always wanted
to be in a horror flick.
But now, you get to live it.
Help!
Somebody please!
Keep it up.
Look it over.
Who the fuck is that then?
None of your fucking business.
He's the life of this film.
The legend is true,
consuming its latest victim.
Now, this is the final
act so listen closely.
My boy Red Eye here
will be tying you up
and torturing you.
I'll be off in the distance
recording with my camera,
following your screams.
This is the main scene where
the protagonist comes in
to save the
supporting character,
but realizes he's just
a little too late.
This should be good.
Gage.
Gage.
Please.
Now listen.
You fucking cunt.
You'll have one more chance.
One more chance
to get this right,
or I will personally slit
your fucking throat myself.
Let's get it right.
Good?
Now!
Action!
Rykyr, where are you?
Rykyr?
Rykyr!
Rykyr!
This is the second
time you've fucked up.
You've only done
one thing right.
She wasn't supposed
to die yet, goddammit.
You dumb fuck.
Did you not read the script?
I'm not paying to
fuck up my film.
Watch closely.
This is how you make
a good horror flick.
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!
I'm so glad you guys
could stick around
for the grand finale.
But,
it's a shame,
she won't be sticking
around for the sequel.
Oh.
Your blood's still
a little warm.
All the killing
has got me worked up
for a little song.
Wouldn't you agree?
♪ I put the knife right in ♪
♪ I put the knife right in ♪
♪ I'll put the knife back in ♪
♪ And I'll twist it all about ♪
♪ And do the hokey pokey ♪
♪ And turn yourself around ♪
♪ That's what it's all about ♪
Yeah.
Ah.
I might have to use
your blood as a little
bit of lubricant, yeah?
Fuck.
Your pussy's so tight,
who would have ever known.
Fuck!
I enjoyed that.
How about you?
Oh.
Yes, Gage.
You were amazing.
- Hello.
- Hello.
My name is Gage
Barker and I'm doing
a documentary on, uh, Red Eye.
And, you're the only that
lives within a few miles
from Black Creek, so,
I was wondering if you
might be able to tell
me more of the legend.
Sure.
In fact my brother,
Barry, he knows even more
than I do, so let me
go and call for him.
Barry.
Hello Barry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You mind coming
to sit down with me?
It's okay, Barry.
Go sit down.
It's okay.
I'll just be right inside.
Okay.
Do you know anything
about Red Eye?
I have a couple of
friends that are willing
to come out here and do
this documentary with me.
But, I wanna make it real.
So I guess what I'm
asking of you is,
would you mind being my Red Eye?
I look forward to
working with you Barry.
Ain't you a sight
for sore eyes.
What's going on here?
Isn't it a coincidence
that I'd actually
break down for real this time?
Just the flat?
Yeah.
She'll be back up and
running in no time.
How is filming going?
It's bloody fun.
Yeah, I can see that.
It looks awfully real, too.
Corn syrup and a
lot of food coloring.
Where is the rest of y'all?
Uh, they decided to stay back
and finish up packing.
Um, we actually ran out of gas.
They sent me to see
if maybe you might
have an extra can.
We just need enough
to get back into town.
Yeah, why don't you help
me here with this spare tire
and then we'll go
back to my house
and I'll get you an extra can.
I take it y'all had a good time?
Yes, I did.
Well, we all did.
You know, it was pretty
epic if you ask me.
A group of people
coming together to, uh,
bring your hard work and
passion into a reality.
Damn allergies.
The lug nuts are
looking a little corroded.
I'm just, I'm gonna
check the trunk and see
if I have anymore.
So, how was my
performance yesterday?
Was I believable enough?
Gage?
Gage?
It's such a shame we
won't be able to use this
in the project.
You're fucking crazy, Gage.
All the best people.
Gage.
No.
Didn't your mom ever tell if
you have a mouth full of wood
to never swallow?
Why'd you do it, Gage?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why would you do
this to me, Gage?
Why?
I fucking did it, okay.
I did it.
I made my dream a reality.
Oh snake.
Dude, nobody's
gonna wanna watch this
boring documentary and not
a damn thing's gonna happen.
Just you wait.
My name is Gage Barker,
and you're watching my
first film, Red Eye.
