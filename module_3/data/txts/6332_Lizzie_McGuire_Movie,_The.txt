Excuse me.
Could you tell me
how to get to the medical school?
I'm giving a lecture in 20 minutes,
and my driver's a bit lost.
You go straight ahead,
and you make a left over the bridge.
That's a lovely accent you have.
New Jersey?
Austria.
Austria?
Well, then...
"G'day, mate."
"Let's put another shrimp
on the barbie."
Let's not.
Who's got the Wiener schnitzel?
Beautiful. There you go, Dolf.
There you go, buddy.
Enjoy.
Let's see.
Next we've got roast beef au jus.
Who's got the roast beef au jus?
Stella, beautiful. Bon appétit.
Walk away, go on. Go on.
Last, but not least.
Foot long! Who's got the foot long?
Very funny, Rascal.
Very funny. In your dreams.
Why haven't you dropped
those dogs off at the show?
Sir, I didn't want them
to perform on an empty stomach, sir.
Move it!
Yes, sir. Mutt Cutts. Ten-four.
Suck me sideways.
Hello. How are you?
I'll be out in one minute.
Why you going to the airport?
Flying somewhere?
How'd you guess?
I saw your luggage.
When I noticed the airline ticket,
I put two and two together.
Where you headed?
Aspen.
California!
Beautiful.
Name's Christmas, Lloyd Christmas.
I'm Mary Swanson.
This isn't my real job.
No?
My friend Harry and I are saving up
to open a pet store.
That's nice.
" I Got Worms."
I beg your pardon?
That's the name, "l Got Worms."
We'll specialize in selling worm farms.
You know, like ant farms.
What's the matter?
Little tense about the flight?
Something like that.
Don't worry. Statistically, you're
more likely to get killed...
going to the airport,
like in a head-on crash...
flying off a cliff. Or trapped
under a gas truck! That's the worst.
I have this cousin,
well, I had this cousin...
Could you keep your eyes
on the road, please?
Oh, yeah.
Good thinking.
Can't be too careful.
Lot of bad drivers out there.
Okay, gang,
you know the rules:
no humping, no pushing,
no sniffing hineys.
Where were you? My dogs were supposed
to be here 40 minutes ago.
I hardly have
any time to primp them.
Don't worry, Mrs. Neugyburger.
-Neugeboren!
-Neu-neu-neug...
Boren!
These pooches won't need primping.
You know why?
Because I bathed them
and I clipped them myself.
And I stand by my performance.
On second thought, you might
want to run a comb through them.
Thanks.
Here you go.
Oh, no, Mary.
I couldn't possibly accept that.
Not after all we've been through.
Thank you, Lloyd.
Good luck with your worms.
How about a hug?
I hate good-byes.
Just go.
Be strong.
She's gonna leave the briefcase
near the escalator.
You make the pickup.
Piece of cake.
Good-bye, my love
There's our payday.
She left it.
Let's go.
Coming through!
Move it or lose it, Sister!
Eenie...
meenie...
minie...
mo!
Hold that plane!
Sir, you can't go in there!
It's okay!
I'm a limo driver!
-Hi, Lloyd.
-Hi, Harry.
How was your day?
Not bad.
Fell off the jet way again.
Who do you figure
this guy's working for?
I don't know...
but we sure as hell
better find out.
The ulcer?
I'll live.
So you got fired again?
Oh, yeah.
They always freak out when you leave
the scene of an accident.
Yeah, well,
I lost my job too.
Man!
You are one pathetic loser.
No offense.
No. None taken.
You know what really
chaffs my ass though?
I spent my life savings
turning my van into a dog.
Hi, Petey.
The alarm alone
cost me 200.
Chicks love it.
It's a shagging wagon.
What's with the briefcase?
It's a love memento.
The most beautiful woman alive.
I drove her
to the airport...
sparks flew,
emotions ran high.
She actually talked to me.
Get out of here!
Oh, yeah.
Tractor beam.
Sucked me right in.
Anyway.
She left this
in the terminal and...
flew to Aspen
and out of my life.
What's in it?
Man!
I'd have to be a lowlife to root around
in someone else's private property.
Is it locked?
Yeah, really well.
There's two of them.
One has a gun.
Did you pay the gas bill?
Do you realize
what you've done?
I'm sorry.
I say we bail.
Okay.
The briefcase ain't here.
He must have taken it with him.
He's got to
come home sometime.
Maybe we should trash the place.
Send him a little message.
I don't think he's going to get
that message, Joe.
I mean the guy's got
worms in his living room.
I got a better idea.
" I tought I taw a puddy tat.
Oh, I did. I did."
Come here.
I can't believe
we drove around all day...
and there's not a single job
in this town.
-There is nothing, nada, zip.
-Yeah.
Unless you want to work
40 hours a week.
Here.
I'm gonna go to the store.
Just get the bare essentials.
That's the last of our dough.
What do I look like?
Cripes!
Excuse me, little old lady?
Do you have change
of a dollar?
Change?
No, I'm sorry. I don't.
Could you do me a favor
and watch my stuff...
while I go break a dollar?
-Of course.
-Thanks.
Hey, I guess they're right.
Senior citizens, although slow
and dangerous behind the wheel...
can still serve a purpose.
I'll be right back.
Don't you go dying on me.
Where's the booze?
I got robbed by a sweet old lady
on a motorized cart.
I didn't even see it coming.
Come on, Harry.
Cheer up.
It gets worse.
My parakeet, Petey.
He's dead.
Man, I'm sorry, Harry.
What happened?
His head fell off!
His head fell off?
Yeah, he was pretty old.
That's it.
I've had it with this dump!
We got no food.
We got no jobs.
Our pets' heads are falling off!
Just calm down.
What the hell are
we doing here, Harry?
-We gotta get out of this town!
-And go where? Where do we go?
I'll tell you where.
Someplace warm.
A place where the beer
flows like wine.
Where beautiful women instinctively
flock like the salmon of Capistrano.
Excuse me.
Could you tell me

I'm talking about a little place
called Aspen.
I don't know.
The French are assholes.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
I know what you're up to, mister.
You just want to go to Aspen and find
that girl who lost her briefcase...
and you need me
to drive you there, right?
Am I right?
-Yeah, so?
-Am I right?
I want to go someplace
where we know someone...
who can plug us
into the social pipeline.
Excuse me.
