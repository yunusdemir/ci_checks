Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
Oh, yes!
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh... Oh, yes! Oh!
Oh, yes! Oh, sh...

So, dogging, tell me
where it came from?
I'm not exactly sure where it
came from, but I mean
I heard about it going back
sort of 20-odd years ago, you know.
Um, when I was in Epping Forest,
I'd be up there with a girlfriend,
and, er, I was having sex in the
car,
and the next thing I know there
was like half a dozen blokes
standing round the car,
and I thought, like,
"Shit? What's this?"
And I jumped out the car
and I said to them, like, you know,
"What's going on?"
And they said, "Oh, we're dogging,"
and I said, "Well, what's dogging?"
And they told me, and I thought,
"Ooh.
"Sounds all right." So it just
sort of went on from there.
Did you carry on having
sex with the girl?
I did, yeah.
There was two actually in there,
two girls in the car.
The ex-wife didn't like it,
you know. I don't know why.
See, dogging isn't
just about everybody going out
and having sex together, you know,
you get a lot of voyeurs who like to
just to watch and have a wank.
They can have a wank and, you know,
and do whatever.
How does that make you feel?
I weren't really paying much
attention to them, I just sort of...
if I'm playing on me own I just
close me eyes and ignore them,
or if me and Les
are doing anything I just
sort of look in the opposite
direction.
Did you enjoy the sex?
Not with my ex. Didn't enjoy it all.
But I enjoy it a lot with Les.
What's dogging done for you?
That's helped
boost my confidence as well.
You would never talk to anybody,
you know, she used to be shy,
and I mean shy.
Her personality now is totally
changed, and I think that's
due to the fact that the last three
years we've been going dogging.
When I go out dogging it's
more about me gaining back
all the control that I never did
have in my old relationship.
I like wearing make-up
because it makes me
feel like a total different person.
It's a way of me
covering up my past.
The bad times.
Old relationships.
Once I've got my make-up on, I don't
see the cracks any more.
I see a prettier me
rather than just a plain me.
And I see a total different person.
Lynx?
Yep, got to be Lynx.
Which one?
Er... Lynx...
I ain't got me glasses on,
what does that say, Sue?
Final Edition.
Yeah, it's the black one.
Can't beat it.
That and Joop.
Brilliant.
My kids now, they know what we do.
I haven't kept nothing from them,
they know we go out dogging.
What do you think people
think of doggers?
Some people hate us,
but we're not interfering with them.
We try to keep out of people's way,
you know,
if we want to do it, we do it.
We don't want to live a boring life.
People who sit there
and, "Oh, yeah, them doggers,"
and all that crap, and yet
behind closed doors they're all
sitting there watching porns
and stuff like that.
We don't go in for watching porn
films, they're boring,
you know, it's either the real
thing or nothing.
Right, this is a little place
we know.
♪ Dum-de-dum-de-dum dum-de-dum. ♪
Come on.
'You can never predict what'll happen
when you go dogging, you know?
'You never know what happens
when you go into the woods.'
It's going to be fun, this is,
I tell you.
Move your dress.
'Yeah, when we go out dogging,
when blokes are watching and that,
'you know, I just feel
good in myself that I'm there
'and, I suppose, supplying
that bit of entertainment.'
'I DJed for 35 years,
so I love entertaining people,
'and, you know, you're putting on,
like, a little show.'
'I just feel that little bit
more important.'
Does it get addictive?
This lifestyle?
Well, yeah,
cos I have sex with no strings.
If you're going somewhere you can
get free sex that don't cost
you nothing, you never got
to see the person again,
so it don't matter whether
you do a good job or a bad job.
What could be better? Obviously
that's going to be addictive.
Welcome to my home,
five or six days a week.
Is it comfy?
Yeah, you make it as comfy as you
want. I mean, the bed is comfy.
I mean, I would probably sleep
better in here than what
I do in a proper bed.
So what do you do in here?
I'm parking up for the night
and going to go dogging.
And you drive a lorry as a living?
Yeah.
You know, on the road five
and six days a week,
covering the whole country.
Dogging in as many
places as I can find.
It's a lonely job.
Out on the road every day.
Out on the road on your own.
So when you park up
in a dogging site,
there's always somebody to talk to.
Most of the people in
the haulage company business
know about dogging,
cos originally dogging was
started with couples
and lorry drivers.
And this is one of the perks
of being a lorry driver.
What percentage of
lorry drivers are into dogging?
Going by the amount of lorry drivers
I know, I would say 70%.
Do you feel like you're
hunting for something?
Yeah, the furry triangle.
The furry triangle?
Yeah.
Obviously you go and try and have...
If you're in a dogging site,
obviously you want to try
and have fun with the females.
There's always females about,
wanting sex.
Some nights you'll sit around
and you won't see a female
and another night, there'll
be five or six females about.
Do you have a family?
No.
Would you like a family?
No.
Isn't it nice to be in love?
What is love?
Sharing something with somebody,
more than just sex?
Personally, I prefer to be
as I am doing the job.
That way, you're not hurting nobody
and you can't get hurt yourself.
Have you been hurt before?
No, I wouldn't say hurt. I've spent
a lot of money in relationships.
Most men,
when they sit and work it out,
they have to pay for sex regardless.
This way you don't pay for it.
I like to think that
my wife is desirable.
I'm extremely proud
of the way she looks.
And how long have you been
with John?
15 years.
Married?
Yes.
Are you quite highly sexed?
Like in your normal life?
Yeah.
Yeah. I'd say yeah.
Yeah.
Well, up until, say,
four or five years ago,
we were having sex
every single night.
Yeah, that's not why
we come down here
because we haven't got no
sex life at home. Is it?
No. Certainly not.
I think when we first
started coming up here,
we'd pick one or two
blokes to go with.
Well, I like quite a few blokes
to come up here with us.
I like one after another.
I just come down here, I suppose, to
get through as many blokes as I can.
'I don't want them to care about me.
I don't want them to care about me,
'I just want them to like what
they're looking at, fuck me and go.'
Oh, yeah.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
And the quicker they come,
the better.
Cos they haven't come down here to
make love to someone for hours.
They just want to come
and they just want to go.
Do you pair get up here often?
Been quite a few times
this year, yeah.
This year, yeah.
I like to talk to the blokes
first for a little while.
Just to get an idea of
what they're like.
Just to get a gist of what
they're like.
Once it's in you and you get...
It's like a drug, though.
I do find it...
very moreish.
I've met people
from all walks of life.
I've met undertakers,
I've met vicars, solicitors...
weirdoes, all sorts.
So you get quite different
types of men, do you?
Yes.
Oh, you get a very broad spectrum
of people down here, believe me.
Right from the nice people to
just complete idiots.
You do get people go down there
that think if a woman's down there,
it is just a free-for-all -
you can do what you want cos
that's what they're down there for -
which certainly isn't the case.
There are guidelines and things that
you have to adhere to. You've got
to remember it's still my wife at
the end of the day and you can't be
taking liberties just cos they're
down there for having sex with men.
It doesn't mean that you can just
roll up and just do what you want.
And who makes the rules?
Me.
Do you feel scared that you're
sort of alone in the woods
with your wife and eight men?
Never.
No, I don't either.
No.
I think the more blokes
there is, the safer I feel.
It's a very strange situation.
I think you've got to be quite
confident, I think, of yourself,
to be able to have sex with a woman
in front of an audience,
so to speak.
Do you like this kind of
animalistic nature of dogging?
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, I do.
What were you watching on TV?
It's the X Factor at the minute.
But we haven't been watching it,
we haven't had time.
Why not?
Too busy.
I work in a factory full time.
I work seven days a week,
12 hour days.
When I get home from work,
I'm really tired.
What's got you into dogging?
Just to try something different.
Yeah, just to try something different
and see if we can have some fun
in meeting people
and making friends, really.
And how long have you been
dogging for?
Four weeks now.
Has it been that long?
I thought it'd been
about three weeks.
Three weeks, yeah.
Toffee...
What have you got?
Toffees.
We just drove around for a bit,
went down this quiet path
and then we just pulled up
and we went into the woods
and played with each other.
It was quite good,
actually, quite exciting.
So you're not having sex?
We've tried...
We've tried but we kept getting
disturbed every time we started.
The people kept going past
and it kept putting me off,
because I know it's a dogging area
and people are going
to be going past and watching,
but I think because it was our first
time up there it just put me off,
people going past, even though
I know they would be going past.
And why've you started?
Why have you felt the need
to start dogging?
It was just, I think I got bored
of just being with him,
so I thought I'd try cheating,
it just happened
to get out of control, really.
I was just cheating
with any random person
that would show me the attention.
And I felt guilty each time I did
it, so I had to tell him.
It's not been easy,
it's not been easy at all.
But because I love her,
I've stood by her.
And I want to make a go of it.
I want to be with her.
I think that's the reason
why he proposed we go dogging.
Yeah, I thought we'd go and do it
as a last resort
to try and spice things up
between us as well.
I think it can work for both of us.
I think it's very exciting.
So this is it.
This is the dreaded lane.
They refer to it
as the dogger's lane.
Well, this land belongs
to The Three Squirrels,
who apparently have told the police
they will fence it off,
but whether they will or not,
I don't know.
So the cars would meet here?
Yeah, they'd actually
cut the trees back.
Who'd cut the trees back?
The doggers themselves, yeah.
They made
their own little space.
In the woods?
In the woods and at the bottom,
so that they could park their cars.
It's sometimes 16 cars,
that kind of thing, up here.
Every day of the week, I mean,
seven days a week, it never stopped.
I mean, if you come in,
you'll see it.
I mean, it's like a city in here,
They've created
all the little roads.
You can see,
it's just a maze of paths
that they've created around here.
Here's one of
the little hides that they had.
If you went down there,
that was absolutely full of condoms,
full of pornography, knickers...
They dragged mattresses
and things like that up.
They'd created
almost like little rooms.
But it was up here the police said
that they had cut branches
into penis shapes
and were sitting on them,
sticking the tree branches
up their backsides.
They caught a guy
with a bag over his head.
He'd handcuffed himself to a tree,
absolutely nude,
and put a sign around his neck
inviting people to abuse him.
"All I ask is that you don't take
the bag off my head."
I mean, how bad can that be,
not even knowing who's abusing you?
I used to bring my two girls,
who were really young,
we used to bring them
into the woods here,
and of course,
we'd made all little stories up
about fairies living in the trees
and things, you know,
like, little kids love all that.
And then you watch them grow up
with that innocence.
And then you're walking down one day
and all of a sudden,
"Daddy, there's a man there
with no clothes on," you know,
and it's like, "Oh, holy moly!"
You know, somebody said to me
it's that Age of Aquarius love-in.
It's that mental picture
that people have
of people sort of skipping
through the tulips, you know,
in flimsy summer dresses
and then stopping for a quickie,
whereas you've seen the reality
of it, it's nothing like that.
So why did you move down here?
Well, we moved because
of the countryside.
We wanted to live
in the countryside.
We both spent our lives
working in the city.
We didn't expect this.
You don't get this
in central London,
so to get it here in the middle
of the countryside, real bad shock.
What's it like
having your wood back?
It's great.
And this is what it should be
like, you know?
This is what it's for.
It's a nature reserve.
The doggers haven't stopped,
they've just moved
to a different area?
Well, we think that's what happened.
We don't see them, so you'd
have to guess that, yeah,
they've just moved on
somewhere else now.
Some other poor sods
will have to put up with it.
How many women and men are going
to sit and watch this programme
and go, "Oh, I wish I could do that"?
I bet there's loads
of people that do,
I bet there's loads of women
that dream about, you know,
having two men or three men
or however many,
but wouldn't dare mention it
to their husband.
While Susie's having sex,
what are you doing, John?
Watching, normally.
I enjoy watching her
having sex, I must admit.
I like it when there's, like,
a small group of blokes
and they're just taking it in turns
on her. I find that really arousing.
I don't know, but a lot of
the blokes have said that
they find you intimidating...
because of the way you look.
They see you and sort of think,
"Oh, I wouldn't stand a chance of
going with her, cos she looks..."
Yeah, which I've told 'em, they've
only got to come up and talk to me.
Yeah.
And they'll find out what I'm like.
Yeah.
Sometimes when you go with a bloke
they can't get a hard on,
and I do feel a bit disappointed.
I think there's something wrong
with how the way I look then.
I've never felt secure in myself,
ever, ever, have I?
Which is absolutely astounding.
I pull myself to bits all the time.
Where does that come from?
From years of being anorexic
when I was younger.
Anorexia fucks your mind up.
Big time. It does.
I wanted to die.
When I ate, I could feel
the fat going on my body
and I just had to go and be sick.
I couldn't leave it in my body.
It's awful, it's horrible.
If anybody asked us
to go out for a meal,
I would be anxious, sweating...
I was frightened,
frightened that I had to eat.
You'll never be happy
with the way you look.
I'll never be happy with my body,
ever be happy with my body.
Ever.
But then it makes me feel better
when I go out and I get compliments
and blokes say it looks nice,
and so that makes me feel better.
I'm on a high,
it makes me feel good,
it makes me feel nice about myself.
For a little while.
And what scares you in life?
I think getting old scares me.
I think getting old
and not looking nice.
Worrying that John's not going to
find me attractive any more.
That's what scares me.
I am frightened of that.
Hm. Silly.
If you do something different or
you have something that's different,
people will either ostracise you
or treat you differently,
and all I ever wanted to do was
to be treated like everybody else.
I'm a mum, that's what I have to do,
and even though my children have
special needs, I just cope with it.
All three of them have now been
diagnosed with various conditions,
so that's quite hard.
I felt alone for a long while.
When I get dressed up
and go out and play,
I leave all that at home
and I become me.
I'm not Mum, I'm not
someone's other half.
I am me, and I suppose
in a way that's a release.
I leave all that behind.
I find it hard to think
of myself as being sexy
because I'm a big girl,
always been big.
I just didn't class myself as
being attractive to other men.
I suppose it's self-confidence
and self-esteem.
I never felt part of the in crowd,
I was always on the outside,
and I just, I don't know,
I just never felt happy with myself.
But, as I'm getting dressed...
I can see this sexy,
voluptuous, confident woman
who is ready to go and
have sex with a stranger.
And, you know, they can't wait
to get their hands on me.
That is a hell of an ego boost.
My husband will be downstairs
in the living room.
He knows exactly what I'm doing,
and I always tell him that
I love him before I go out the door,
because I do.
And then thinking about coming home,
even at that point
I can't wait to get home
because I want to get home
and get my hands on him,
because it is,
it's like foreplay.
I enjoy it, but
the best bit is coming home
and knowing that he's
going to be waiting for me.
I think we're looking for
another woman for Terry.
We think if there
was another woman,
he can get his enjoyment
out of all the dogging.
It's always been a dream
of mine to have two women.
So, who's this?
It's Anne.
Yeah, I'm Anne.
How long have you guys
known each other?
About a week.
Only a week?
Yeah.
You guys have become friends?
Yeah, good friends.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whilst Terry's been at work,
what have you two
been doing all day?
We've been watching TV and
having a laugh together.
Yeah. Nothing, you know...
We won't play without
Terry being here.
Yeah, really.
She's had a stroke of my tit
but that's about it.
I don't know.
Is that what you'd like to do, Anne?
I like to play,
yeah, definitely.
What playing do you like,
do you think?
I like everything, but I do really
like oral, you know what I mean?
Well, I've performed
oral on Terry
and I've sucked
Sarah's breasts.
Yeah.
How do you feel about this, Terry?
I'm fine with it.
Yeah?
Still learning, obviously.
We're still trying new things.
You've got two women now.
Yeah.
Every man's dream.
Definitely.
To be honest, we can't
really do, like,
a lot of things in Terry's car,
cos it's quite small.
And where's Terry
fit in with all this?
I'm the driver.
And how are you, Terry?
You said you weren't very well.
No, I've had a sore throat.
I've been to the doctor's.
A bit croaky.
What did the doctor say was wrong?
Tonsillitis.
It's very bumpy.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Can you not go over the big bumps?
In the woods, anything can happen.
So where are we going?
Into the woods. Not too far.
Not too far, because
we don't want to get lost.
Shit, I can't see fuck all.
Neither can I.
I can now, cos the light's...
Eurgh!
This part looks muddy.
No, it's dry.
That is fucking muddy as fuck.
Fucking hell. There you go.
Thank you.
I will lead the way.
Is this, like, marsh
or something we're on?
What do we do now, then? Terry?
What? You two can have a play.
Why just us?
Yeah, why just us?
No, Terry, let's have
a play with you.
All right, then.
Come on, then, Terry, get 'em down.
If one of you's just going to...
Oh, fuck this.
Go on, Sarah.
Come on.
Awww.
You didn't take any Viagra
today, Terry, did you?
No.
Hopefully this coldness,
like, you know...?
Awww.
It is getting there. It takes time,
cos it's cold, innit?
Yeah.
I'll let you off.
I'll bet this is lovely,
Terry, isn't it?
Yeah, it's great.
It's great.
Do you see my tits?
Of course he can.
Ah, that's good.
Shame there's not another guy here,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
I think I need a bit of help.
Terry, do you want your dick sucked?
No.
No?
Yeah?
There you go.
That's it. Nice. More like it.
What's it like being out here, then?
Oh, it's good fun.
Great fun, yeah.
Why's that?
Just a thrill, isn't it,
and then you get to play as well,
so it's all good.
Exciting, really.
Ow!
Why do you choose to do this
outside and not in your home?
In the home, it's vanilla,
really, isn't it?
It's like we're young, you know...
We want to have some fun.
We want to have
some fun before we...
get too old.
Yeah.
I think it's really good.
I think, obviously,
if we had more...
if we had another guy here,
you know what I mean?
I think it would have been great.
It's our second time in the woods
as well, so it's the second time.
Are you going to keep coming out
even though it gets colder?
I... Oh, yeah.
I'd like to see if
we can get it up here...
- There's somebody coming.
- Yeah, I can hear something.
Who is it?
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know.
Looks like you've got
your new person to join in.
Sarah, I'm not comfortable
with this.
- All right.
- Not really.
Pardon?
He said he's not comfortable.
OK.
That's why it's not...
I think he doesn't like
people too close.
Sorry about that.
What do you want to do?
I'm too cold.
OK, we should just leave it, then.
Leave it, then.
Come on, then.
I just want to go home. Oh.
I'm sorry.
I didn't like that at all.
Yeah.
So how's the dogging been going?
Slowed down obviously
cos of the weather.
Down in Kent, it's never been
absolutely brilliant.
There's a lot of
police activity around,
and I think a lot of people
are staying away.
Have they been stopping it?
Yeah, yeah,
it's been stopping big time.
Say hello, Rocky.
Say hello.
It's padlocked in.
He can open this.
And you can see
where he's bent the metal.
Don't want him
killing the cat, do we?
Stop it! Stop it!
It's like if you were sitting
in here and I opened up that cage,
he wouldn't come to me,
he would fly straight over to you,
you'd put your arm out,
he will sit on your arm
and he will just sink his beak
straight into you.
No questions asked.
No, don't bite.
See, a lot of parrots,
they pick one person
and one person only.
And anybody else is a threat.
It's sort of like a mate
if you think about it, you know,
cos over the years and that,
they find a mate
and they stay together for life.
But, you know, we have
our little arguments and that,
but it's never, ever, ever about
who I shagged the night before.
I could drop dead tomorrow.
You know, I've seen it happen.
Um... I've seen me brother
fine one minute...
and then, like, within six months,
cancer and dead.
You know? And I look at him
and I think, like, you know,
I just intend to have
as much fun as possible.
You know, at least when I do die,
I'll die with a smile on me face.
I mean Sue's 29, I'm 49,
my kids like her,
you know, they get on well.
How many kids do you have?
14 boys...
twin girls,
a stepson and a stepdaughter.
18?
Yeah.
Hopefully 19 coming up.
Really?
Yeah. Game for one more
before I have the chop.
You know, other than that,
I'd have to be using condoms,
and, like, condoms just like...
don't, er... don't work for me.
Don't fit.
Why's that?
They just don't,
just don't fit, too small.
Can't you get bigger ones?
Tried, no good.
Extra, extra big ones?
Never tried the extra, extra.
Right...
Let's see who turns up.
So what are you doing now?
Just going on the internet
to see...
to see who's about.
I feel sorry for Sue.
She missed the golden years
of dogging
when it was natural and original.
Since the internet's come on,
you know,
dogging's just absolutely
gone to shit.
You know, we spend so much time
on the internet
trying to arrange to meet people,
when really we should be
out in the woods shagging.
What's happening?
No-one about at the moment,
not this area anyway.
Where are they all?
Midlands, Scotland,
Broxton,
A41.
I don't think we'll ever stop
going out dogging.
That's our weekend relaxation.
I think I'll just carry on dogging
till the day I die.
What Sue will do after that,
I don't know.
This burger's really nice.
How's it going, Sarah?
All good.
But... I think deep down
I want to give the dogging up.
Cos I think deep down
I don't want to do it no more.
It's been up and down lately,
to be honest.
What do you mean?
I've thought about quitting myself,
and just stop it altogether now.
So what's this whole
dogging experience done for you?
Made me realise
how much he loved me.
I don't think I realised he cared,
to be honest.
That's a nice feeling.
Really nice.
I don't think I've had people
care like that for me before.
I'll always protect her.
It's my job as her boyfriend.
Just think we're better than that.
