Please wait, Diancie-sama!
Diancie-sama, it is time! Princess!
Hide-and-seek is so much fun!
Ssh! Not right now, everyone!
Diancie-sama!
I got caught.
Do not "I got caught" me!
Princess, you said yourself that...
Majima, are you all right?
I am.
This is not the time to laugh!
Princess!
Elder!
Di!
Diancie-sama,
you have an important mission.
You must not forget that!
For a long time, that Sacred Diamond has provided our country with great power and tranquility.
However, unable to fight the passage of time, its life is now ending and it is about to lose its sacred radiance.
But it is shining so beautifully...
Worrying too much will be bad for your health.
Please take this seriously!
All right, all right.
<i>Answering once will suffice!</i>
All right.
If the Sacred Diamond is lost, our country will go down the path of destruction.
You are exaggerating.
I am not!
Diancie-sama, you are the only one who can give birth to a Sacred Diamond!
Today is the day you will show me your powers.
I got it. I will do it. I will do it, all right?
...Not that I think I can do it.
Princess!
Yes.
Keep it up!
As I thought, I cannot do it.
I am sure you will be able to!
That is what you were born to do, after all!
I am grateful that you have raised me.
But I...
Xerneas...
Go meet it.
"Xerneas"?
That's right.
Years ago, while I was on a journey,
the terrifying Great Destruction occurred in a place called the "Alearth Woods".
My life is getting absorbed...
It's over...
This is...
Fairy Aura.
Oh.
It was thanks to Xerneas that I survived.
If I meet this... uh...
Xerneas.
...meet this "Xerneas" and receive the Fairy Aura that will let me unleash my true power,
will I really be able to create a Sacred Diamond?
You will!
Believe in the Fairy Aura!
Then I will go.
I have long wanted to see the outside world.
Please take this more seriously!
All right, all right!
You answer...
Once, right?
All right!
Pocket Monsters, or "Pokémon" for short:
The strange, mysterious lifeforms on this planet.
In the forests...
In the skies...
In the seas...
Wherever you are in the world, you can be sure to see them.
Also...
Humans and Pokémon have bonded in many different ways as they've lived together in this world.
This boy, Satoshi of Masara Town,
battles and gets Pokémon alongside his partner Pikachu.
As a Pokémon Trainer, he continues his travels in the pursuit of new knowledge.
There are as many dreams as there are Pokémon.
There are as many adventures to be had as there are Pokémon.
Mega Evolutions sure are powerful.
Heheh.
Let's keep the Mega Absol lady!
Huh?
Have my big brother, s'il-vous-plaît!
Hey, Eureka! Your small act of "kindness" is a big bother to me!
Think about it!
Pikachu!
Riot.
I won't let you get in my way.
I was about to say the same to you.
Well then, I shall excuse myself.
No you won't!
Stop this! Two against one, that's not fair!
And you call yourselves Pokémon Trainers?
Don't interfere.
I have use for the diamonds that little one can create.
You speak too much, Marilyn.
<i>You're not a classy bandit, you're a chatty bandit.</i>
Bandit?
Run while you can.
Pikachu, Thunderbolt!
Over here!
What the?
What's going on?
Should we call Junsa-san?
We should be fine now.
Everyone, you have my gratitude for saving me.
It talked.
You're right!
It is telepathy.
How cute.
I'm Satoshi.
Satoshi.
This is my partner, Pikachu.
Pikachu.
I'm Serena.
Serena.
I'm Eureka.
Eureka.
I am Citron.
Citron.
This is a Pokémon, right?
Let's see...
So it's called "Diancie".
That bandit earlier mentioned it too, but it looks like it has the ability to create diamonds.
Diamonds?
So that is why they were after it.
We came here in pursuit of Pikachu...
...and found an incredible Pokémon in the process.
If we get that Pokémon...
Those people were bandits.
What might such "bandits" be?
Bandits are people who take what's precious to others without asking.
They're bad people!
So "bandits" are deplorable folks, then.
I have learned a lot.
Diancie...
These are great.
Thank you very much.
It is delicious.
Just help yourself; there's no need for self-restraint!
It appears you have considerable appetite.
Yeah.
Eat much, sleep much.
Those are the basics of good health.
I'm going to grab seconds.
Diancie, wanna come along?
Oh... Yes.
Well then, I shall be going along with you.
This way.
Diancie is so polite.
She acts just like a princess, don't you think?
You can say that again.
There are so many different things.
Yeah. Let's just grab a whole bunch!
<i>Same here. Let's grab...</i>
Grab...
Grab as we please!
Diamonds are minerals formed over hundreds of millions of years and an extremely rare substance.
They're very sturdy. They say a diamond's shine lasts forever.
That's why they're so valuable.
This one looks delicious.
It's the Rocket Gang!
To think it'd be this easy to get our hands on Diancie.
What luck.
You are also bandits, correct?
We're the Rocket Gang!
Bandits are those who would take what is precious to others without asking, are they not?
Such is an evil act.
I have learned about this.
<i>And you'll be learning a lot more from here on.</i>
All about the harsh realities of the world.
Yeah.
I am immensely grateful for that.
However, I must be going back.
Well then, good day to you.
Good day to you... Uh...
W-Wait, hold up!
Woah there.
We can't let you leave.
We've got some work you gotta do for us.
I have never worked.
You can create diamonds, right?
We've done our research, you know?
Make us some diamonds.
Some really sparkly ones.
So that was the kind of work that you wanted done.
I could do that much for you.
Huh?
You will?
That was fast.
How nice, you're surprisingly obedient.
However, please do not be disappointed.
Of course we won't. Come on, give us some diamonds!
Carats, carats!
Well then...
She did it!
Amazing!
With just this single one, we can eat as much Salisbury steak as we want for the rest of our lives!
We can eat as much tofu fritters as we want, too!
We can even eat as much ice cream as we want for dessert...
Give us more!
Very well.
So pretty!
There's a second one!
With this, we can build a luxurious house!
And we can build a vacation home with a hot spring!
We can even buy a resort condo!
Come on, come on, more! Give us more!
Here they come!
It's a diamond bath!
It might just cleanse my body... ow, ow!
They hurt, but they feel so good!
Step back!
Huh?
Over here. Hurry.
Look, she's over there!
Diancie!
Are you okay?
You haven't been hurt or anything, have you?
Nothing has happened to me.
As soon as I made some diamonds, I was allowed to go back.
I knew it, the Rocket Gang wanted diamonds as well.
It's good that you're safe, Diancie.
But right about now, I suppose those bandits will be disappointed.
Huh?
Eh? Huh? Ah!
Nyah!?
Huh? Wha? What, what, what!?
The diamonds are...!
No! Eh?
They disappeared!
I am still unable to exert my true power.
The diamonds you make disappear?
Yes.
That is why I am searching for Xerneas.
"Xerneas"?
It is a legendary Pokémon.
If I remember right, it is said to be able to grant life.
Wow.
It was explained to me that Xerneas' Fairy Aura...
...would bring out my true power.
It is because you are also a Fairy-type, right?
Xerneas, huh?
I want to see it too!
Me too!
Here, here! Eureka too!
Of course, I do too.
Diancie, could we go with you?
That would delight me as well.
Satoshi, everyone, I shall permit you to accompany me on my journey.
Huh? Permit?
<i>She really is a princess.</i>
Huh? Diancie's a princess?
If Diancie returns underground, we won't be able to find it again.
Marilyn and Riot...
They're desperate for it too.
Gotta watch out for them.
Hm?
These people...
Hah! No need to bother with them!
Diancie's safe.
Good work, Miriss.
How about some chocolate?
Dad, aren't you eating too much of those?
They just came out with a new mint chocolate.
I ordered these all the way from the Houen region.
Besides, the cocoa that's used in chocolate is good for you.
Cocoa contains...
I'm worried about your health, Dad!
I know that.
Geez.
Diancie...
Is Xerneas really going to be in this direction?
I do not lie.
I was told that lying is something that should not be done.
Then how do you know that it's this way?
I am able to feel the traces of Fairy Aura that Xerneas left behind.
Xerneas will certainly be there.
It will...
I suppose it is futile.
If you make a wish before a shooting star disappears, it's said that it will come true.
A wish?
Yeah.
I shall try.
I'll join you.
Now!
I wish that Diancie will be able to make diamonds.
It is a group of Buoysel and Floasel!
Ya-ho-hoi!
Everyone, you all swim wonderfully.
This is the most fun I have had since I began my journey.
That's because it's fun being with friends!
What are "friends"?
Friends are...
They're friends. Right?
They're fun companions you play and talk together with.
You help them, they help you.
It refers to an equal relationship.
"Friends"...
We're friends now, aren't we?
Well then, I permit you all to be my friends.
Diancie really is princess-y.
But that's wonderful, Diancie.
Friends... I am so happy.
Is this...?
It's a diamond!
That is incredible!
So pretty!
However, it will disappear before too long.
It will?
Even if it does disappear, could you let me have it?
I will give it to you, Eureka.
Yay! All right!
Thank you, Diancie.
Whose castle might this be?
Hm? It's not a castle.
It's a shopping mall.
It's a place to go shopping.
What is "shopping"?
You've never done it?
No.
How about giving it a try then, Diancie?
Forget about Xerneas for just a little bit.
Very well then.
I shall permit shopping.
There she goes, giving us permission again.
Diancie, let's go!
Wait up!
There they go.
Girls will be girls.
How cute!
<i>What is this?</i>
There's a hat, too!
Shoes as well.
Ta-da!
You really look like a princess!
Right?
Yeah.
Diancie?
What's wrong?
Hey! Bro!
Are you done shopping?
We're still in the middle of it.
What? You're still at it?
We just wanna look at a few more before we decide.
Diancie?
I have been caught.
Eh?
Here.
Nice recovery.
Where'd they go?
Oh, there they are!
What are those Pokémon?
Do they work with the bandits?
We have to help!
Leave it to me!
It is time for science to open up the future!
Citronic Gear, on!
It is the Super Stretch Ladder DX!
Satoshi, get on!
All right!
Here we go!
Yeah!
Technology is incredible!
Okay!
Luchabull, I choose you!
Diancie!
Jump!
What were those Pokémon?
Those were the Jewel Pokémon Melecie.
It's rare for them to show up in the middle of a city like this.
They have finally found me.
Then they really were the bandits' underlings?
Well...
Diancie...
Did you have fun shopping for the first time?
You're the bandit from back then!
Come on, get over here.
I will not!
Then I have no choice.
Mafoxy!
Leave this to me! You guys get out of here!
Go!
Where do you think you're going?
Keromatsu, I choose you!
Keromatsu, Water Pulse! Pikachu, Thunderbolt!
Get out of my way! Flamethrower!
Those are some good Pokémon. I can't bring myself to dislike them.
Please, help us out.
Everyone, get on!
Sihorn, go!
Go!
Thank you, Sihorn.
You were a big help.
Bye bye!
Will Satoshi be all right?
Satoshi's going to be fine, count on it!
Yeah.
This is entirely because of me. I am causing everybody trouble.
Of course we help our friends when they are in trouble, that is a given!
I was going to say that!
Everyone...
<i>What was that?</i>
Diancie!
I am fine.
Diancie!
No!
Diancie!
No!
Dedenne, Nuzzle!
Now!
I'm pleased! I'm truly pleased!
To think you would oppose my Gekkouga using such a primitive method.
I've taken a liking to your bunch.
Again! It's one after another!
You're pesky!
Gekkouga, Double Team!
Harimaron, help us out!
Fokko, you too!
Harimaron, Pin Missile!
Fokko, Flamethrower!
Water Shuriken!
Satoshi!
I am glad you are safe!
Run away, Diancie!
I will!
Princess!
Majima!
Diancie-sama, we will protect you.
You...!
The Melecie from before!
Don't get in my way!
Attack!
Princess!
A Sacred Diamond!
Diancie!
Princess!
Brigarron, use Pin Missile once more!
Who's that?
She is the woman who rescued me from the Rocket Gang's place.
Then she's on our side?
Diancie, better get moving!
Princess, this way!
Yes. Pardon me.
Miriss Steel.
If you're here...
...then I take it Algus is here too?
I wonder.
We serve to protect Diancie-sama.
So you're the princess' bodyguards?
So Diancie was a real princess all along.
Who are these people?
We're...
My...
...friends.
Hup.
We have been traveling for several months.
To search for Xerneas?
Yes.
I feel the Fairy Aura.
We constantly moved to new locations, but we were never able to meet Xerneas.
One day, I saw a city far in the distance.
I wanted to go see it.
Somehow, it seemed as if it would be fun.
And that's when you met us?
Diancie-sama might have felt confined after being with us all this time.
I am sorry for acting according to my own convenience.
Please, do not do something like this again.
I will not.
What's this?
It is one of our countries, which can found all throughout the world.
All these countries are connected through these diamond paths.
Thank you for coming out to greet me.
What is this?
Princess.
Di!
The Sacred Diamond has finally expended its lifespan.
What are you saying?
No...
I have come all this way to let you know that.
What's the Sacred Diamond?
Tell us!
We'll do anything we can to help.
Yes!
Everybody...
The Sacred Diamond is the source of the energy glow that is sent throughout our countries around the world.
It has vanished.
Only Diancie-sama is able to forge a Sacred Diamond.
But I still do not have that power.
Xerneas' Fairy Aura is sure to awaken your true power.
So that's how it is.
I had no idea about the state the country was in.
I...
I have no right to be called a princess.
Don't cry, Diancie.
Crying never solves anything.
Princess.
It is as you say.
This is no time to be crying.
Let us go, to meet with Xerneas.
That's the spirit.
Princess.
Diancie-sama!
Wow!
I feel a strong Fairy Aura from the forest over there.
Then, Xerneas is...?
Right there!
Princess.
Those are the Alearth Woods.
The Alearth Woods?
Long ago, the Alearth Woods gave rise to the Great Destruction, which would wipe out all life.
Since then, it has become forbidden land that nobody must set foot in.
There is also something else I must tell you.
It is about the cause of the Great Destruction.
The Great Destruction was caused by Yveltal, the embodiment of Destruction.
After destroying everything, Yveltal turned into a cocoon.
Alearth became forbidden land because that cocoon resides there.
"Yveltal"?
If I remember right, it is a legendary Pokémon said to be able to take away all life.
According to legend,
those who disturb the sleep of the Cocoon of Destruction shall receive judgment of fury!
Huh?
These are the Alearth Woods?
It is hard to believe the Great Destruction happened here.
The ruined forest revived over the many years that passed since then.
It is said that Yveltal caused the Great Destruction in order to bring out the forest's ability to regenerate.
So you are saying that even the Great Destruction might just be another part of the law of nature...
The law of nature?
The birth of new life, death... that kind of "rules", so to speak, the natural world follows.
Isn't this considered forbidden land?
But Diancie is inside this forest.
We can't give up after coming this far.
Nay!
Xerneas!
You mean that?
Xerneas, please wait!
Xerneas.
You have pursued me all this time, haven't you?
I have finally been able to meet you.
I know what it is...
...that you are seeking.
Eh?
I shall bestow it upon you.
It's the Fairy Aura!
It is you yourself that will have to foster life.
Xerneas, you have my gratitude.
Diancie-sama!
Princess!
I felt the Fairy Aura too!
<i>I kinda feel like I was given strength too!</i>
Now you can definitely save your country!
So have I become able to forge a Sacred Diamond, I wonder?
Try it out!
I'm sure you can do it!
Princess!
Congratulations, Diancie!
Now you're finally able to make real diamonds, right?
You are...
You're the one who helped us the other day?!
We will be taking Diancie!
What's this about?
We knew all along.
The reason you were trying to meet Xerneas was because Diancie still didn't have the power to make real diamonds.
Thanks for helping.
A Diancie that can't create diamonds is as pointless as a chocolate without cocoa.
Algus Steel.
The big-shot bandit...
And that's his daughter Miriss.
It was quite hard, you know? Watching over you to keep others from interfering.
Okay, Vine Whip!
I'll be taking Diancie!
Hitotsuki, after them!
Brigarron!
Diancie!
We must save the princess!
If you want diamonds, I shall give them to you! So please, let me go!
I have to hurry back to my country!
Thanks for your excellent work.
Marilyn!
You look fantastic even when you're angry, Riot!
Later!
Hold it!
Here! This way, Diancie!
Diancie!
You brat!
Excuse me!
Why?
No, I just sort of...
<i>What is this?</i>
I don't know.
Hand over Diancie!
No way!
When adults talk, you listen!
There's too many of them.
What do we do?
It's impossible for us to get in there.
Oh no!
Diancie-sama! Satoshi, my boy!
Get out of there!
The Cocoon of... Destruction!
"Those who disturb the sleep of the Cocoon of Destruction...
...shall receive judgment of fury!"
That's...?
Yveltal.
Princess!
Gotcha!
Diancie!
Pikachu, Thunderbolt!
Diancie, are you all right?
Yes!
We're getting out of this dangerous forest right now!
Never mind the diamonds.
Our lives are more important!
<i>What is that Pokémon?</i>
My Mafoxy has been...
Riot?
It's no good.
Eh?
Let's give up on Diancie.
Watch out!
I can't believe this is happening.
The forest will vanish once again.
Hey, everyone!
Princess!
You're all right!
Luchabull, thanks a lot.
It's warding off Yveltal's power!
That means she's finally...
Princess!
I still do not have the power...
Diancie!
Pikachu, Thunderbolt!
My dear Satoshi, Diancie-sama must be protec...
Majima.
Pikachu!
Hang in there!
I need to protect everybody...
And yet I...
...cannot do anything.
Don't give up!
It's only when you give up that it's all over!
He is right!
You can't give up!
Hang in there!
Pikachu, are you all right?
Okay...
Thunderbolt!
It is you yourself...
...that will have to foster life.
I will not give up.
A Mega Evolution!
Wow!
You did it!
<i>This is a Sacred Diamond!</i>
Little boy and Pikachu...
Thanks for helping us out back there.
We'll return the favor.
Yeah!
We got it!
Miriss!
Dad!
Xerneas.
It left.
We are safe.
Pikachu.
Huh?
Pikachu, what's wrong?
Back then...
Pikachu!
What's wrong? Hey!
Pikachu!
Pikachu!
Answer me, Pikachu!
Pikachu...
Pikachu!
Xerneas...
Pikachu!
Princess!
Majima!
Everybody!
Xerneas has granted you life.
It is turning into a tree.
Xerneas...
...has chosen to sleep here on this land...
...in order to protect the law of nature.
It's dying?
No way...
Do not be sad.
Xerneas is talking!
What is it saying?
This is not a death.
This is a sign of birth.
This is a sign of birth.
And...
And...
...the beginning of hope.
...the beginning of hope.
Birth...
...and the beginning of hope...
I see.
Thank you, Xerneas.
It's so pretty.
Yeah, it's like...
...we've been reborn.
Somehow, this feels...
<i>...really good.</i>
Princess!
Well done!
Satoshi, Pikachu, Serena, Eureka, Citron...
Everybody, thank you oh so very much.
I'm glad to have met you, Diancie.
Me too.
Eureka too!
We are friends forever.
Yeah.
Huh?
This diamond!
It stayed without disappearing!
Huh?
Then that's the first diamond that Diancie made?
Ah...
It's a proof of our friendship!
Yes!
Diancie, you keep this.
I shall treasure it!
Yeah.
Yeah.
