('We think we know
Britain's) wildlife...
'..but there's a secret world
beneath our feet.
'A hidden kingdom teams with
millions of burrowing creatures,
'their lives shrouded in mystery.
'Why do they live underground?
'Where do they sleep...and eat?
'And how do they raise their young?
'Their secret subterranean world
remained unseen...
'..until now.'
Wow! Look at this!
This is our vision come true.
'We are breaking new ground
in natural history.
'We've unearthed
real animal burrows.
'And created three lifelike replicas
of our own.
'A rabbit warren,
'a water vole burrow
'and a badger sett.'
To be able to crouch here,
this far away from a little badger
and observe what it's up to -
it's beyond my dream!
'It's spring now, but winter
was a busy time for our burrowers.
'Our rabbits have bred,
'but will their young learn
the skills they need to survive?'
It's quite a brave moment
for these little things.
'Our two water voles got off
on the wrong paw,
'but are things looking up?'
If there ARE babies in there,
that's where they'll be.
'And our seven orphaned badger cubs
have begun to bond as a group,
'but can they master
the badger basics?'
This is the first time
they've had the opportunity to dig!
'And we uncover the dark secrets
of the burrower that can do this!'
Phenomenal! Hopefully, people may
see moles in a different light.
'We have a window on their lives
like never before.
'Explore this magical world with me,
Chris Packham,
'as we ask in this programme,
'how do young burrowers
grow up inside the burrow
'and prepare for their first taste
of fresh air?'
This is a momentous moment
in the lives of these young badgers.
'It's spring in Britain's Southwest
'where, in a unique experiment,
we've built three replica burrows.
'Our badger sett is now home to
a family of seven playful orphans.
'And 100 miles away,
on a small Dartmoor farm,
'we've created a riverbank burrow
for a pair of water voles...
'and a vast warren, big enough
for a whole community of rabbits -
'all under the watchful eye
of a team of the country's
'of top filmmakers
and naturalists.'
Welcome to Burrower Central,
here in Devon.
It's six months since
our unique project began here
and already we've learned
so much new science.
But having said that, there's
a lot more that we want to know yet.
It's springtime now
and our young burrowers face
their biggest challenge yet -
taking their first steps
into the outside world.
'Our burrows aren't
just underground.
'They're all equipped
with protected outdoor spaces.
'We know from the wild that spring
is when young emerge from the burrow
'for the very first time.
'How will our young burrowers
prepare for the outside world?
'We'll watch as our badger cubs
learn to communicate...
'..as our newborn rabbits
find their way
'out of the labyrinth of the warren,
'and as the next generation
of young water voles grow up
'and get ready to leave home.'
We ask, what role does
the burrow play at this important
stage of our burrowers' lives?
Will it provide them with the skills
to survive outside?
'There's a major clue
that our ten rabbits
'have enjoyed their first month
in our warren.
'They've been breeding like rabbits.
'Led by head buck Thumper...
'..the two squabbling males
'have already sired seven litters
between them.
'Hazel is the top female.
'And like nearly every adult doe
in the warren,
'she has a litter of her own.'
There is something enchanting and
magical about this rabbits' nest.
It's pulsing with young rabbits.
We can't see them.
They're completely hidden
by the fur,
but they're all down there,
huddling to stay warm.
We're not entirely sure
how old they are.
Maybe a week or just over.
It'll only be a few days, then they
will start to come out of the nest
and explore the rest of the warren.
Then it won't be long
until they look like this -
a fully fledged bunny.
'At two weeks, these seven kits
'have reached
the next stage of development.
'They belong to Pipkin.
'Despite only suckling from Mum
for three minutes a day,
'they've matured rapidly.
'Rabbit milk is one of the most
nutritious in the animal kingdom.
'They've gained sight,
'can now hear
'and they weigh five times
the amount they did at birth.
'And now that their fur
is fully developed,
'they can leave the warmth of
the nest and take their first steps.
'For the moment, at least,
'they don't go beyond
their mother's chamber.'
This is going to give us
an extraordinary opportunity
to see these animals raised.
A view that no other naturalist
could have ever had -
looking at rabbits underground,
going about their natural business.
'Their parents are
from domestic stock,
'but they should behave
as they would in the wild.
'Because our rabbit warren,
like all of our burrows,
'is based on data
from the real thing.
'They're the largest constructed
burrows of their kind.
'We want to see for ourselves
the enormous scale
'and structural design
of a wild warren.
'So, six months ago
at Devon's Bicton Park,
'we investigated an abandoned warren
'and began the most ambitious stage
of our natural history project.'
We're going to fill this warren
with concrete.
When it sets and we excavate it,
we'll be able to see the anatomy
of their architecture
in full sculptural 3-D.
And that's pretty exciting.
'Battling one of the worst winters
on record,
'we filled the empty warren
with ten metric tonnes of concrete.
'And then left it to set.
'Now in spring, we're beginning
'the biggest wildlife excavation of
its kind ever attempted in Britain.
'When we finish, we'll have the most
detailed picture ever
'of the rabbits' secret
subterranean world.
'It's going to take another week
to reveal every corner.'
'Our badger sett is located at
Secret World Wildlife Rescue Centre
in Somerset.
'It's been a few weeks
since our cubs moved in.
'They're all rescued orphans,
nursed back to health.'
'Boisterous female Lunar
'is the eldest and biggest.
'She's established her position
at the head of the group.
'She's still just the equivalent age
of a human tweenager.'
This artificial sett that we built
is the perfect rehabilitation
environment for our young badgers,
because it gives them the chance
to learn in a natural setting
about living together as a group.
That will be very important when it
eventually comes to their release.
Of course, in the meantime, it also
gives us a unique opportunity
to delve into the secret life
of badgers below ground.
'This is the cub we named Bramble.
'She'd been found alone
and fighting for her life.
'One of the youngest
and smallest cubs,
'she's had a tough time
fitting into the group.
'Without the others,
she's unlikely to survive
'when this group is released
into the wild.
'It seems she's not quite ready yet
to impress the boss, Lunar.
'She tries her luck first
with a more relaxed cub...'
'..Mr Sleepyhead himself, Truffle.
'The moment Truffle went into
our burrow, he made a cosy bed.'
Their instinct is to make a nest
so that they can stay warm,
which is essential.
'And now, all he does is lie in it.
'Bramble follows suit.
'She cuddles up to her new brother
and then has a snooze.
'But there are
other challenges ahead.
'They'll all be tested for TB.
'And when they're old enough
and fit to be released,
'they'll need to dig
a sett of their own.
'But at just two months old,
'they've already begun to put
their digging skills to the test.'
Just look at our little badgers!
If you look closely -
they're a bit busy at the moment -
but you can see that they're
natural born digging machines.
Look at the shape of their body.
Their narrow nose broadens over
and tapers down.
Perfect for moving through the soil.
And their spine is arched.
This helps with their whole digging
and shifting masses of soil.
And when they grow into adults -
if they ever stop playing -
these things can really shift soil,
double their own bodyweight
at a single time.
'Badgers don't just dig new digs.
'In the wild,
their setts sometimes cave in.
'Burrowers can be buried alive
'if they don't know
how to dig their way out.
'So, will our cubs know
how to tunnel out of trouble?
'To find out, our badger expert,
Dr Chris Cheeseman,
'wants to set them a challenge.'
Well, what we're trying to do here
is we're creating a blockage between
this chamber and the one next door.
There's a tunnel that links them.
Badgers love to dig in soft soils,
typically sandstone,
and it does collapse.
It's going to be interesting to see
whether these badgers
dig their way through.
'If our cubs can't master
this skill,
'they simply won't survive
in the wild.
'Only time will tell
if they're up to the challenge.'
'Back at Burrower Central,
we've created another burrow
'for a completely different
kind of burrower,
'an endangered British species,
about which very little is known -
'the water vole.
'When we introduced a pair bred
for conservation
'into our replica riverbank burrow,
'things didn't go quite as planned.'
There's an altercation going on
between Mr Ratty and Bonnie.
'But after a difficult few days,
we did spot something intriguing.
'They blocked up two of the three
entrances into their burrow.'
They typically do this when they're
about to, or have just given birth.
'And now, water vole expert
Derek Gow
'has spotted an exciting
new development -
'a large ball of grass
in Bonnie's chamber.'
Derek, we can't peek
into Bonnie's nest.
The risk of disturbance
would be too great.
Which is quite frustrating,
but we've got to behave.
What is likely to be going on
in there?
Well, the simple answer,
of course, is "Who knows?" But...
What we know is that they make
these large, coarse,
almost rugby ball shaped nests.
In the inside are these
tiny soft chambers,
lots of very finely shredded
material and moss.
These are the areas that
the water voles give birth in
and where the babies live
when they're very small.
If there are babies in there,
that's where they'll be.
'We don't have to wait long
to find out.
'A few days later, through
a small gap in Bonnie's nest,
'a tiny water vole pup
reveals himself.
'Ratty junior!'
'Bonnie has a small litter
of three pups,
'but she's still
got her work cut out.
'They're blind and helpless,
so she'll have to care for them
'until they can stand
on their own four paws.
'On the other side of the farm...
'in our rabbit warren,
there are now over 20 young kits,
'all ready to explore
their underground home.
'As they investigate THEIR burrow,
we can finally get to grips
'with the full extent
of our real warren in the wild.
'I've returned to Bicton Park,
'where the excavation of our
concrete cast is now complete.'
I've been waiting for today
for months.
For me, this is one of THE most
exciting parts of our project.
We've learned a tremendous amount
about the animals in our artificial
burrows, in terms of behaviour.
What we haven't been able to do
is map the actual burrows
that they create in the wild.
Well, what lies over here
I think might be one of
the final pieces in our jigsaw
of understanding
their underground lives.
The only thing is,
I wasn't entirely sure...
..that it was going to work.
This is an absolute revelation.
I'm really excited by this.
It's such a simple idea -
find an abandoned rabbit warren,
fill it full of concrete
then excavate it.
Look! You can appreciate immediately
the structure.
The most profound thing is
it makes me think
that all of those times I was
walking across the UK countryside,
stepping over rabbit holes
in the ground,
I never knew
what was beneath that soil.
And now, I can see it easily.
Question is, of course,
what can we learn from this?
'A bird's-eye view shows us
just how complex the warren is...
'..with multiple living chambers
'and complex intersections.
'This warren has
over 120 metres of tunnels
'and occupies the same floor space
as the average new-build home.
'Our expert, Dr Sasha Norris,
has already been investigating.'
I'm completely blown away by it.
I think it's absolutely incredible.
My first impressions are
how much it looks like tree roots.
I guess you can expect that
cos the tree and the rabbit are
doing the same thing,
trying to find their way
through the soil.
There's going to be rocks,
bits they just can't get through.
So they have to go sideways
and you've got that organic shape.
It's beautiful, actually.
It's a rabbit sculpture.
Look at this, where the rabbits'
claws have cut into the soil.
It's been preserved for ever,
like the rabbits' Pompeii.
'So, what can this structure
teach us about life underground
'for our baby rabbits?
'Navigating around this maze is an
impressive feat for an adult rabbit.
'But for a tiny kit, a warren can be
up to 4,000 times its size.
'Pipkin's litter are 18 days old
'and they're now ready
to test the limits of the burrow.
'They've left their chamber
'and they venture out
into the adjoining tunnels.'
Imagine being born
in a warren like this,
spending the first few weeks of your
life entirely underground in a nest.
Then you branch out, following
your way through these tunnels
using only a sense of smell,
no light whatsoever.
But this network of tunnels
would suddenly come alive
when all of those young
left their breeding nest
and started to move around.
There is a period
when they're moving around inside
the warren, not outside.
Then it would be like a... A bunny
bundle ..heaving party underground.
'As Pipkin's litter explore
beyond their home chamber,
'they encounter other unrelated
rabbits for the first time.
'In this rabbit nursery, all of
the kids play together nicely.
'The same can't be said
for their over-protective parents.
'Hazel and the other females
have chosen nest chambers.
'And they defend them fiercely.
'Under stress, territorial mums can
even kill kits from other litters
'that stumble into their path.
'So Pipkin's litter are going
to have to become warren-wise,
'if they want to survive
and make it into the outside world.'
'Meanwhile, our badger expert,
Chris Cheeseman,
'has set up a challenge
for our young orphans.
'Are they natural born diggers?'
Chris, it's going to be interesting
to see this.
If they do anything,
it's going to be instinctive.
They've not had opportunity to learn
any of this from any adult badgers.
'One badger gets straight to work.
'No surprise, it's the head of
the group, the big female, Lunar.'
Look at the power of the forelimbs.
That's a beautiful illustration
of the way they can pick it up like
a spade and shift a lot of soil.
Then the back limbs are just pushing
it back, clearing it, basically.
They pull it underneath them,
then they'll kick with the back legs
just to clear it away.
'Lunar works away at the soil. She's
not the only one who's interested.
'Bramble, our small outsider,
'is keen to make an impression.'
Bramble's come in as well now, look.
Lunar's the dominant animal.
She's a bit bigger and a bit older.
Little Bramble, doing her share
of the digging as well.
There's a desire to get through.
You can see there's a bit
of excitement there.
"This is our way out.
We need to sort this."
These are just young badgers,
never had the benefit of learning
from their mothers
or other badgers in the group.
They're instinctively doing
what comes naturally.
And they've broken through.
In no time at all. What was that?
Two or three feet of soil? Yeah.
They are powerful digging machines.
'Our orphaned badger cubs have
proved that they can really burrow.
'It's a skill they'll need
before they can be released.
'Best of all, Bramble has become
a key member of the family.
'There is one more thing
they'll have to learn
'before any of these badgers
can take their first steps outside.
'They'll need to show
they know how to defend their home.
'Whilst most of our burrowers
are ready to step outside
for the first time,
'there is one that's so specialist
that it never has to leave.'
And for that, we had to employ
a completely different approach.
That's because of the way
that it uses its burrow in the wild.
'Our mystery creature gets
everything it needs below ground.
'With some 30 million of them
living in the UK,
'what are the secrets
of its success?
'How does it eat, drink
and even breathe?
'Well, to find out, we cast
an abandoned burrow with concrete,
'just as we did for the rabbits,
'and unearthed a structure
all the more extraordinary,
'when you consider that it was
probably created by ONE animal
'in a single day.'
It's even more impressive
when you consider the volume of soil
that it shifted -
up to 540 times its own bodyweight.
Now, that is a bit like me shifting
this lot in a day -
40 tonnes of soil.
So, what is this curious creature?
It's the mole.
Based on our burrow cast,
we created a mole burrow of our own.
So, what we've got here are boxes
with a closed system of tunnels
which are as close to nature
as possible and ideal for filming.
Our moles were rescued and have now
been rehomed in our burrow.
They should feel at home.
It's completely enclosed
and just like being underground.
So what can we learn
about this ultimate burrower?
One man who can help us
is mole enthusiast Peter Stafford.
At the age of just 17,
Peter captured a series
of astonishing images
that remain the only pictures
of a wild mole nest ever shot.
This picture won him the title
of Wildlife Cameraman of the Year
in 1967.
Look at this! Yeah. The detail
in these images is phenomenal.
I know. Absolutely extraordinary.
Look at this,
powering along its tunnel. Yeah.
Wonderful exploratory behaviour.
It's padding the surface
with its nose as it comes forward.
That's amazing. Look at that!
You can see all its whiskers.
'Our exciting new view of moles
moving through the soil
'backs up a theory that Peter
has had about them for years.'
It's extraordinary footage.
I'd describe the motion of a mole
through soil as a swimming action.
It pulls itself through,
rather than digs its way through
in the traditional way
we think about burrowing.
'This swimming mole theory
might seem unlikely...
'..until you go underwater...
'..and watch a common seal
in action.'
Seals have very streamlined bodies
for slipping easily and gracefully
through the water.
Moles have streamlined bodies for
pushing their way through the soil.
These animals don't have their limbs
beneath their body,
like many quadruped animals do
to support their weight.
For seals, the water is supporting
that bodyweight.
They have their forelimbs
on the side of their body,
just like moles do.
'To understand Peter's theory,
you have to go below the surface
'and get down to the bare bones
of his idea.
'A mole's skeleton is just like
a miniature seal.'
The seal has its hands turned into
these huge flippers
for pushing through water.
Here we have a spade - or a shovel!
By virtue of its sixth finger,
which gives it incredible width.
A key feature is this modification
of the forelimbs, isn't it? Yeah.
Exactly the same there.
That's an incredible
piece of natural sculpture.
Very few people would say
that was an arm bone!
'With a sixth finger
on each of its front paws,
'short upper arms
and reinforced shoulders,
'the mole moves through soil just
as the seal moves through water,
'pushing the soil away
with sideways strokes.
'This is what's known
as "convergent evolution" -
'two completely different animals
that have evolved in the same way.'
This is an animal that swims through
the sea and here we have an animal
which, through similar adaptations,
swims through the soil.
That's exactly what they both do.
'But moles are solitary creatures,
so we have to ask,
'why do they dig out
such an extensive burrow?
'Well, it's not just a home.
It's a trap -
'one that earthworms
regularly fall for.
'The mole's tiny eyes
are virtually useless in the dark.
'Instead, it uses its nose.
'But not for smelling - for feeling.
'Its nose is covered with over 5,000
sensory cells called Eimer's organs.
'These are so sensitive they can
feel the tiniest of vibrations -
'even the moment when a worm
drops into the burrow.
'The mole pulls the worm
through its enormous paws,
'forcing out any dirt,
like toothpaste.
'And if it's not hungry,
it bites off the head
'and uses venomous saliva
to paralyse its prey.
'Which it then stores
in a special chamber.
'A living larder, full of tasty
earthworms that never spoil.'
Things are very quiet out here
at the moment in the tank area.
Occasionally, we get to glimpse
Ratty and Bonnie,
but all of their litter
are inside the burrows,
doing the essential job
of fattening-up first.
'A few days after we last saw them,
'our young voles are ready
to move out of their nest.
'At just a week old, the babies
are nearly half the size of Mum.
'That's like a newborn baby
growing into a seven-year-old
'in just five days.
'So how is it that they've grown
quite so fast?
'Suckling.
'Amazingly, four of Bonnie's teats
are close to her armpits
'and this might be,
like for other aquatic species,
'so her young can suckle
IN the water.
'But Mother's milk is not enough
on its own.
'In just a week, Ratty junior
is already eating solids.
'In fact, all the pups
are now raiding Mum's larder,
'and they are hungry.
'Water voles eat 80% of their own
bodyweight every single day.
'So it won't be long before
Mum's food store runs out.
'Soon, the young water voles
will have to leave the burrow
'to forage for food themselves
on the riverbank.
'If there's one thing water voles
aren't too fussy about it's food.
'They'll eat up to 227
different types of plant,
'especially grasses, but so much
roughage can be hard to handle.'
This is a highly magnified
photograph
of the surface of a blade of grass.
It's not smooth at all.
It's covered with all
of these spines.
Here's another photograph which
shows just one of those in close-up.
The material that makes up
this spine is silica.
When we say "silica", think "sand".
Gliding that between your teeth
makes life tough.
Our water voles have come up
with some specialised adaptations
to overcome this problem.
They've evolved
some of the most formidable gnashers
in the animal kingdom.
I have a water vole skull, Chris.
Lovely specimen. Look at that!
Fantastic! Displaying all
the attributes of a rodent's skull.
Those sharp incisors.
The gap between those,
where they can move the food around,
once they've nibbled it off,
then the molars.
I'm going to try to get a molar out.
These are unique.
Hard enamel round the outside
and the soft bit in the centre
creates these ridges.
They're constantly growing,
that's the point.
They're constantly wearing down,
on account of that vegetation.
Very hard abrasive material.
People don't realise how abrasive
uncooked vegetation is.
It needs a solid grinding mass
that's capable of breaking it down.
'Ratty junior has some of the
toughest teeth in the mammal world,
'and they're constantly growing.
'He'll need them,
so he can eat up all his greens.
'But also for the very thing that,
like Dad, will define him
'as one of Britain's
best burrowers -
'digging.
'He chomps through the soil,
sucks it in, spits it out
'and then kicks it away
with his paws.
'An adult water vole can excavate a
tunnel system up to 70 metres long.
'It can gnaw through roots
and even topple trees.'
I've felt the teeth of a water vole!
You've probably
felt the teeth of many!
They can deliver a sharp a bite.
They can give you
a scorcher of a bite!
And what they also tend to do is,
once they've bitten you,
they get those little front paws
and they hang on.
It's just not
a fun experience!
'Inside our rabbit warren, Pipkin's
litter are now three weeks old.
'They are much more adventurous
and they're ranging right through
the warren.
'They're getting to know this place
like the back of their paw.
'But why? In our burrow,
the kits are safe from predators.
'But they don't know that.
'Their wild instincts tell them
'to get to know every inch of their
warren, for a very good reason.'
A burrow system like this
protects them from most predators.
They simply can't get in.
But there is one that can get in -
and often comes in for the kill.
'The stoat!
'It might be a tenth of the size
of a rabbit,
'but this is
rabbit enemy number one.
'Unlike larger hunters, the stoat
can fit inside a rabbit warren.
'And once it makes a kill,
it can sometimes stay there.
'A stoat, like this one
in a replica burrow,
'will take up residence
inside its victim's chamber
'and, in a horrifying twist,
'sometimes use the rabbit's carcass
as a nest where it gives birth.
'Its victim doesn't just provide
warmth for the young,
'it can also provide ample food
for them as they begin to grow.
'But the rabbits have a trick
left up their sleeve,
'revealed by our concrete cast
of a warren,
'which shows that these tunnels
aren't just a place to rest,
'but also full of escape routes.'
This has got seven different tunnels
coming off it.
Some going down,
some going sideways and up.
If you imagine you're being pursued
by a stoat through the warren,
at this point, you can really
confuse them, can't you?
You can go off
in every direction.
You intimately know
this highway of tunnels.
Because you live in it, you know
how to get away. From that predator.
'We built our warren inside
a protected enclosure,
'so there's no chance
of a stoat attack.
'Our young rabbits
still spend every moment
'learning all of the complex
intersections and secret pathways.
'But will they be ready
for their biggest step of all?'
'One extreme way to avoid being
eaten by any kind of predator
'is to spend your whole life
underground, which is what moles do.
'Our moles will happily live out
their lives in our replica burrow,
'just as they would in the wild.
'But living your whole life
below the surface isn't easy.
'Like all mammals,
the mole needs oxygen,
'and that's in short supply.
'There's so little down here that
we wouldn't be able to breathe.'
To find out how moles cope
with these really tough conditions,
I've come to meet a completely
different species of animal
which, at first glance,
you would think would have little
in common with the mole,
particularly
as it's 1,000 times larger.
It's the alpaca.
It's a creature which survives in
an incredibly hostile environment.
It prospers where other mammals
really, really struggle.
At 4,000 metres up
in the high Andes,
there's 40% less oxygen than
there is down here at sea level.
This presents mammals with
all sorts of problems when
it comes to breathing and respiring.
All animals need that oxygen,
but what the alpacas have done
is radically change their blood.
For a start, they've got many more
red blood corpuscles.
This helps with the oxygen exchange.
They've also got
a lot more haemoglobin,
that chemical which transports
the oxygen inside those blood cells.
Curiously, the mole has gone down
exactly the same route.
It, too, has many more
red blood corpuscles
and a lot more haemoglobin.
It's not living at high altitude,
but it's living in tunnels
where there's only one third of the
amount of oxygen that I'm breathing
here in the fresh air.
The mole's life is
a near complete mystery to us.
There is evidence
at this time of year
that some moles do venture above
the surface, and we have to ask why.
The clues come,
not from watching moles,
but by looking at another
completely unrelated animal.
Tawny owls, like many birds,
produce pellets.
All of the bones, fur and feathers
get compacted into that pellet,
which is regurgitated
through the mouth.
If we can recover their pellets
and look inside them,
we can see what's been
on their menu.
So let's see what we've got here.
Here's a jawbone straight away.
Look at that!
These are the teeth
of an insectivore.
Very different than a rodent.
This is a mole jawbone.
How is a non-burrowing bird catching
an animal that never surfaces?
The bones are the biggest clue.
They're from juvenile moles
that have been turfed out
of their mother's burrow.
It's likely that these inexperienced
burrowers simply lost their way
and then, on the surface,
become completely vulnerable
to birds of prey.
What about that?!
That's really neat.
We're learning something about
the social behaviour of one animal
through the diet of another!
Pretty fantastic! And I'm really
pleased with that bone.
'Our badgers now seem properly
settled in their new residence.
'They've bonded as a group.
'Now they'll need to develop skills
'they'll need for encountering
other badgers.'
It's perhaps not surprising,
given they spend so much time
down in the sett in the dark,
that badgers don't rely upon
their eyesight
when it comes to recognising
things and communicating.
It's their sense of smell
which is most critical.
If you look very carefully
at their face,
you can see they've got
these very long, quite broad snouts.
They've got big noses!
You can see here,
Bramble at the moment,
is not looking at that soil,
she's sniffing that soil.
They have this snuffling behaviour.
It's one of the things that defines
the behaviour of badgers.
The reason that they're drawing in
these massive intakes of breath
is so that they can smell very
quickly exactly what they're after.
But what are the scents
they're so obsessed by?
There's something
that they're doing to each other
with their hind quarters.
And the results seem
irresistibly smelly to the others.
This is interesting stuff.
Look very carefully at Lunar,
at what she's doing.
She's compressing the back part of
her body down onto another animal.
What she's doing
is scent marking that animal.
Badgers have sub-caudal glands
at the base of their tail.
They carry a personal perfume.
She is anointing
her other group member here,
so they know who they've had
an encounter with.
By scent marking the others,
Lunar is reaffirming her status
at the top of the group.
She, and all of our badgers, are
leaving their perfumed calling card.
But they don't just scent mark
each other.
They also leave scent
on their droppings.
So what role could that play?
What are these young badgers
going to use that for
out in the wider world?
'We can find out in the wild
'if we go to the place
where badgers go to the toilet.
'They repeatedly use
a series of latrines
'located on the periphery
of their territory.'
It's fair to say that, to the bulk
of our audience, this will look like
an ugly pile of poo.
But to the badgers, this is like
a veritable perfume counter!
Well, this is part
of a boundary latrine.
Badgers mark their boundaries
by defecating in these latrines.
This is a scent beacon,
which sends a message to other
badgers in the neighbouring groups
that this is "our patch"
and that's yours and stay there!
It is a mutually respected
boundary marker,
like a fence round your garden.
They're very active
when they're defecating.
They get very excited.
I've seen groups of badgers.
Three have arrived at once.
This is fantastic fun,
finding a latrine!
Seeing who's been there,
whether your rival's been there,
digging a pit, adding your own.
Exactly right.
They do get really worked-up.
Almost frantically scratching around
and smelling.
We can't smell it, unless you stick
your nose right down there.
To a badger,
this is really full of scents.
I'm going to give it a go.
It does have a characteristic smell.
It's not too strong,
but it's characteristic. Musty.
Yeah, musty. Very different from
a fox, which is much more bitter.
Once you've learned a smell,
you can always tell.
I bet you couldn't tell between the
different badgers. Give me a chance.
That's Brian.
That's...
Yeah, Brian and Stan.
And Stan had a worm tandoori
that night.
Definitely.
'Scent mark latrines
are vitally important,
'because badgers from a family group
usually don't take kindly
'to trespassers on their patch.
'Our badgers will need to recognise
the scented latrines of their group
'to protect themselves in the future
when they're released into the wild.
'With each wiggle
of the end of her tail,
'Lunar demonstrates
her scenting language skills
'and the others follow suit.
'Back at Burrower Central,
'Pipkin's litter are now
nearly four weeks old.
'They're looking a lot less
like baby bunnies
'and more like small versions
of their mum.
'These physical features are vital
to their survival above ground.
'Because these animals are hunted
by just about everything.'
Look at her eyes.
Typically, predators have their eyes
on the front of their face.
When they're looking forward, they
can judge distance extremely well.
Important when you're about
to grab something.
If you don't want to be grabbed,
where do you put your eyes?
On the sides
and on the top of your head.
Pipkin here can see not only
forward, to look out for the fox,
and behind to look out for the fox,
but also up at the same time,
to look out for the buzzard.
So it's a very good adaptation.
The second thing - look at her ears.
At the moment, they're inactive.
When you watch a rabbit on the
surface, its ears are always erect.
What's more,
they can twist them in different
directions at the same time.
They can listen for predators
over here AND over there.
So, they've made physiological
adaptations to avoid being eaten.
'The big moment has arrived.
'Pipkin's young are as ready
as they'll ever be
'to undertake the journey
'they've spent the last four weeks
preparing for.
'With Mum, Pipkin, leading the way,
'they venture
into the outside world.
'But how will they take in
the foreign sights and sounds
'and their first
breath of fresh air?
'Sasha and I are waiting eagerly.'
Here they come, Chris.
Look at that! On the brink!
It's quite a brave moment
for these little things.
We know there aren't any predators
in our enclosure,
but they don't know that.
'Even without the threat
of being eaten,
'the outside world is overwhelming.
'Bright sunshine. New smells.
'New sounds.
'And boisterous adults.
'For some of Pipkin's litter,
it's just too much.
'All they want to do
is huddle for security.
'Mum is on hand to reassure them.'
Look how attentive she is here.
Head up the whole time.
She's not feeding at all.
She's looking around,
constantly vigilant.
Occasionally, she's thumping away,
to warn them.
They're all in a tight cluster,
which is what you'd want.
The kits don't just look to Mum
for protection.
This is interesting. We've seen them
grooming one another in the warren.
Now, they're all looking after
one another.
That's a way of forming affiliations
with other rabbits.
They don't just groom
their own family.
They also groom other litters
and adults.
This is how they tell each other
that they're part of a group
and maintain that group.
It's a behaviour called
allogrooming.
Physical contact builds bonds
and secures friendships,
so everyone can watch out
for danger.
Because outside the warren,
security for a rabbit
is a case of safety in numbers.
The more rabbits there are,
the more eyes, the more ears,
therefore, for the individual,
the more time spent feeding.
Now look. They're taking
their first fresh meal, if you like.
Up until this point,
they've been fed on milk.
What's interesting is they learn
the right types of food to eat
from the chemicals inside the milk
that they drank in the warren.
So they know the flavour
and they can pick up the scent
and eat that to get them going?
That's right.
Those plants won't be poisonous
cos their mum ate them and survived.
I wonder what it's like,
that first bite of a fresh leaf.
That must be a flavour sensation!
'Our kits' preparation for
the outside has served them well.
'They've used their time
in the burrow to grow
'and learn vital skills
for survival.
'But there are still trials ahead.
'Life for an adolescent rabbit
is fraught with challenges.
'Their instincts tell them
to always be cautious.
'When one is spooked...
'..everyone is back in their burrow,
in just a few hops.
'At our riverbank burrow,
the water voles are busy.
'Bonnie can be seen
restocking the larder
'and Mr Ratty is taking
his daily dip.
'So far, the youngsters haven't
made an appearance outside.'
We've got to look at these, Derek,
and think that the burrow
has provided them with enough
security to mature
to the stage that they can be
this independent this quickly.
They've taken on all the weight they
require to be strong and fit enough.
Now, it's a more testing time.
They've got to find their own way in
this world. It's really something.
It's a remarkable thing to see.
'In just two weeks, that's half
the time it took our baby rabbits,
'our young water voles
are ready to step outside
'and take their first swim.'
'After just a moment's hesitation
'our first young water vole
is straight into the water.
'And then there were two.
'They love the water -
and a good play.
'But where's Ratty junior?
'At first, he's not as confident
as the others.
'But after a little
comfort eating...
'..he finally ventures out.
'He soon masters the water,
'although he hasn't quite mastered
getting out.
'It's Mum, Bonnie, to the rescue,
'whilst his dad takes
a more relaxed approach.'
This is a happy conclusion.
When you think about it, at last,
the youngsters have come out
into the wider world, into
the water, and they're looking good.
There's something personally
satisfying, I've got to say! Yeah.
It's really lovely. It's delightful
to see them behaving in this way.
They're just beautiful animals.
'There's only one group of burrowers
still to step outside -
'the badgers.
'Our orphaned cubs
are now three months old.
'In the wild, at around this age,
'cubs are encouraged to leave
the sett by their mothers.
'But here, without parents to
guide them, we open up the burrow
'and hope they'll take
their first steps outside.
'It's the first real test of
how well they've bonded as a group.
'Will they face the outside world
together?
'As badgers are nocturnal,
we have to wait until it's dark.'
This is a momentous moment
in the lives of these young badgers.
It's the first time that they've
come outside into the wide world.
Imagine the sensory overload!
Look how busy Lunar is here,
with her nose.
The first thing she's done
is start snuffling in that soil.
It must be loaded with new smells.
'At first, it looks as if Lunar
is on her own.
'But as night falls,
another badger appears.
'And then Bramble follows,
hot on their heels.
'Eventually, the whole group
explores together.
'Now, it's a protected enclosure,
but our orphans don't know that.
'Any strange scent or sound
and they're on the alert.
'It's a great sign that our badgers
are instinctively sensing danger.
'One cub has got a bit over-excited.
'Lunar can't resist a good romp.'
'So, the seven cubs have taken
a brave step,
'but that's enough for one night.
'Before long,
they all head back inside,
'to the familiarity
and comfort of their sett.'
We've had a fabulous few weeks
with this amazing experiment.
We've learned a tremendous amount.
We've seen Ratty junior
and his siblings, the water voles,
have grown at a phenomenal rate.
Our young badgers learned
all about scenting and digging
before they stepped out.
Pipkin's litter developed
a protective community
before they, too, ventured out
into the wider world.
One thing's for sure, we've seen all
of our burrowers using their burrow
to prepare them
for life above ground.
This is a remarkable project and
we've learned a tremendous amount
about all the secret lives
of these animals.
'Next time,
how will our rabbits cope
'with a warren
that's full to bursting?'
For them,
it's a case of "breed like mad".
'Will our young water voles
be ready for life in the wild?
'And will our badgers learn
to talk badger
'and be ready to leave the sett
for good?'
This looks like a lot of fun,
but this is preparation
for their life ahead.
