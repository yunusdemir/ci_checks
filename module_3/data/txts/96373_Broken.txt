Tori.
Tori.
Come on, girl.
It's three foot north shore.
Dad, five more minutes.
More waves for me.
Mm.
You should replace
that thing.
Never.
Not a bad day for a dawny,
with my favorite dad.
Your only dad.
Yeah, and that makes you
my favorite.
Well, your favorite dad's
about to steal your wave.
Hey!
Show off.
- How's that?
- Not bad.
You could still put more
snap in your turns though.
- Really?
- Yep.
Let me show you
how it's done.
Just like your mum.
You were saying?
What does he want?
Dad, what does he want?
I don't know.
Whatever.
Nice waves.
She's learned good.
She's a natural.
She's got
a good teacher.
What do you want.
Murph?
I need you back, Logan.
That ain't gonna happen.
Well,
things are getting worse.
Those Pouakai,
gone way outside
their turf.
Last week,
they robbed a place
on Kensington.
That's two blocks
from my pad.
- Not my problem.
- Yeah.
Well, they're gonna
make it your problem.
Paulie caught wind
of their next move.
They're planning on
taking out the leadership,
strike the shepherds
so the sheep will scatter,
kind of stuff.
Still not my problem.
Present and past
leadership.
Just to make sure
the job's done.
They'll come for you too,
Logan.
That might not have
bothered you back in the day,
when you had
nothing to lose,
but things
are different now.
You gotta think about
what's best for her.
I think about what's
best for her every damn day.
That's why
I'll never come back.
You gotta do
what you gotta do.
Murph.
You should lay low for a while.
Nah, bro,
Mad Bulls need me...
and I need them.
You gotta do
what you gotta do.
So I was thinking.
Why don't you come with me
to youth tonight?
Nah, I don't think so.
Last thing you want is
your old man kicking around.
Lots of Dads are there.
To keep an eye
on you lot, no doubt.
Yeah, well,
you know me,
always up to no good.
Yeah.
So you'll come?
I'll think about it.
Good enough.
<i>It's seriously
out of control. And what's worse,</i>
<i>is that most people are just
going about their lives,</i>
<i>totally unaware
it's even going on,</i>
<i>until it spills out
into the streets.</i>
<i>Then it makes headlines,
and everyone seems shocked.</i>
<i>How do you
propose we deal with this?</i>
<i>The only way is to
cut it off at the root.</i>
<i>Make it flat out illegal.</i>
<i>Illegal to wear a patch,</i>
<i>illegal to be in a gang.</i>
<i>That's extreme, isn't it?</i>
<i>Well, desperate times
call for desperate measures.</i>
<i>Thanks for calling in.</i>
<i>We're gonna go
to our next caller.</i>
Next...
Son of a...
In a hurry there,
Mr. Buckland?
Allison Krauss
start at 9.
Don't want to be late.
Ha, that's funny.
Couldn't help but notice
the ol' pole wagon on your tail.
Anything you want to share?
No.
Nothing
to declare, sir.
It's Alan.
Sir makes me sound old.
Look Logan,
getting out
couldn't have been easy.
But you made
the right call.
Uh huh.
It'd be nice to think
you moved on
from all of that,
for good.
Are we done?
We're done.
Listen,
if you need anything,
just give me a call.
Now watch your speed.
Yes, sir. Sorry,
Alan.
Hands up, come on, come on.
Come on Rob,
keep your hands up.
Damn it, Rob, you're leaving
yourself wide open!
I told you
to keep your hands up.
That's enough for today,
guys.

You all right?
Yeah.
What's going on?
Murph came around
this morning.
Well, can't say that
I didn't see that coming.
What did you say?
I said no.
And that's that.
What is it?
Murphy reckon the Pouakai
are coming for home.
And for me.
Really.
Why now?
I don't know.
Well,
God help them if they do.
It's not me
I'm worried about.
Tori.
Coop,
- I've already lost her mother.
- Mate.
The past is the past.
You have to let that go.
Easier said than done.
Yeah.
I hear ya.
Hey.
Why don't you
take tonight off?
- Nah, I'm fine.
- Go on.
I can run the lads
through a circuit.
Yeah, right.
Hey, just me.
Tor?
Coming.
Gotta go,
see you tomorrow.
Hey.
Who were you talking to?
No one.
Just myself.
You hungry.
Definitely.
What are we having?
Oven roast chicken,
mash with garlic butter,
and honey glazed carrots.
Hmpf.
What?
Nothing.
Tell me.
Your mum used to make it
all the time.
It was like her specialty
or something.
Except she always snuck
the garlic out of mine.
Huh, garlic breath.
Nah, didn't agree
with me.
Going in was fine.
It was what came out
afterwards,
- that was the problem.
- Dad.
So how was it?
Not bad.
Could have used
more garlic though.
- Like mother, like daughter.
- Yeah.
You got that right.
It's okay to talk
about her, you know.
Well,
I think it would be nice
to talk about her.
Tori.
Forget it.
What time are you
heading back to work?
Coop gave me a night off.
So you can come with me
to youth then.
Come on, Dad,
you said you'd go.
I said I'd think about it.
Well,
you'd really like it.
Look, I know you're into
the whole church thing,
and I'm happy for you.
I am. But it's not for me.
How do you know
if you won't try?
- Let's all give it a rest.
- Come on.
Enough!
If you want to go,
then go.
Leave me out of it.
See ya, Dad.
I'll be home by 10.
Love you.
- Hey, Tor.
- Hey.
Tor.

<i>I'll do whatever Jeffrey do.</i>
<i>Jeffrey bathes.</i>
Tori?
Hello.
Who is this?
<i>Change. Make change.</i>
Come on, be home.
Pick up.
<i>Hi, it's Tori,</i>
<i>sorry I can't come
to the phone...</i>
Damn it.
Coop! Coop!
Coop!
You okay.
They were looking for you.
I told them I didn't know
where you were,
but they're hard of hearing.
Where's Tori?
- We gotta get you to the hospital.
- Logan.
- They hunt in packs, where's Tori?
- I don't know,
I've looked
everywhere.
She should be at home.
Then that's exactly where
you should be.
Go I'm fine.
Call the cops.
And send them to my place.
<i>Hi, it's Tori,</i>
<i>sorry I can't come to
the phone right now...</i>
<i>Hello.</i>
Tori, listen, I need you
to lock all the doors.
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- All the doors.
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- Do exactly what I say.
Lock the doors.
<i>Okay.</i>
- <i>Doors are locked.</i>
- Good.
I need to go out front,
see if any cars are there.
- <i>There's no one there.</i>
- Are you sure?
<i>Dad, what's going on?</i>
Coop got attacked tonight.
I think it might be
the Pouakai.
- <i>Is he okay?</i>
- He'll live.
I got him to call the police.
They should be there soon.
Tori!
- <i>Where is he?</i>
- <i>What do you want?</i>
- <i>Ahh!</i>
- Tori.
<i>Put it down.</i>
- Tori!
- <i>Let me go!</i>
<i>Did you lose?</i>
I swear to God,
if you touch her...
<i>It's a bit late for
that, don't you think?</i>
- <i>Now, where is it?</i>
- Where's what?
<i>Don't toy with me, Logan.
I'm not in the mood.</i>
<i>We know
Murphy gave it to you.</i>
Murphy?
I haven't seen him in months.
<i>Dad, they've got a gun.</i>
Tori, it's gonna be okay.
<i>Listen to him, is
it really gonna be okay?</i>
<i>You better start talking.</i>
Okay, look,
Murphy came and saw me
this morning.
But he didn't give me
anything.
<i>Right, next shoot her.</i>
Hey! Whatever it is
you're after, I don't have it.
<i>You know, Logan,</i>
<i>you really shouldn't leave
little girls at home,</i>
- <i>all on their own.</i>
- Listen.
You know me.
You know what I'm capable of.
You do not want to do this.
<i>Close your eyes, sweetheart.</i>
<i>Dad...</i>
<i>I love you.</i>
Listen, I'm telling you,
I don't have...
<i>We'll see you soon, Logan.</i>
Tori!
Tori.
I'm sorry, baby.
You can follow them
if you like.
Logan.
I'm really sorry, mate.
We'll be launching
an immediate investigation.
So when you're ready,
I need to ask you
a few questions.
Yeah.
I know how it works.
You think
he knows who did it.
He knows, all right.
And he won't talk.
Neither will Coop.
That's a gang thing.
I thought
Logan was out.
You think
he'd retaliate.
I guess
we'll find out.
So you want to be
a Pouakai, hey, boy?
Well, you're gonna have to
get through me first, my boy.
Fight's time.
Ah!
Get up, get up!
Ooh!
He's goin' down.
So you still want to
be a Pouakai, my buddy?
Is there anyone else?
Huh?
Is there anyone else?
You know...
one of these days,
you're gonna be the guy
alone on the floor.
Any luck?
I guess we should've
asked for the password,
before we put a bullet
in her head.
Pew.
You didn't find anything
else that could've been,
hard drive, USB, anything.
We searched most of the house
before the cops showed up.
Just got that lappy.
And this little gem.
Yeah, well maybe
he was telling the truth.
Maybe Murphy
didn't give it to him.
At least we won't
have to go looking for him.
He'll come knocking
soon enough.
She looks so beautiful.
She always did.
Where's her necklace?
I don't know.
Mr. Buckland...
I... I shouldn't have
just dropped her off.
I should've waited
until you got home.
It's not your fault.
Tori loved
Cantea Youth Group.
Made her happy.
Yeah,
she really liked it.
I...
Thanks.
She deserved better
than this.
Yeah.
She did.
She looks
just like her mum.
You don't remember me.
do you.
We only met once.
I was a friend
of Tori's nana.
I'm sorry.
No, don't be.
You were
a lot younger then.
So was I.
But she was just a baby.
Even then I knew
she was someone special...
...whose story
isn't over, Logan.
You coming.
Suit yourself.
I remember when her mum
gave her that thing.
The look
in her eyes.
The lads are talking.
Didn't take them long.
I don't think they'll do
anything till after the tangi.
But you want to have
a chat with Murph,
just in case.
Will I?
Logan.
They will kill
someone for this.
Probably.
And that's
what you want?
You think
that's what she wanted.
She sure as hell
didn't want this!
What were they
looking for, Murphy?
It's best
you don't ask.
They killed my daughter.
Best you answer.
You remember that cop
that got shot last year?
Well, they knew
it was the Pouakai,
but they couldn't
prove it.
But we got
video footage of it,
starring
the big man himself.
Cruz?
But it was Axe
that pulls the trigger.
All right,
I'm sorry, man.
If I'd have thought
for a second,
that this is what
would've happened,
I never
would have come by.
So what's the plan?
We can take care of this.
You stay here with your whanau.
Mourn your loss.
I've mourned enough.
Mad Bulls.
Mad Bulls.
Logan...
...what's going on?
What do you think?
Logan,
you have to let this go.
They killed one of our own,
and you just want
to let it go.
Look...
out of respect for Tori,
- I don't think...
- This is bigger than Tori now.
This is about honor.
Honor. Whose honor?
Tori's and Logan's or yours
and the brotherhood's?
Logan is
the brotherhood.
Sorry,
Coop.
You don't have to
be sorry.
You don't owe him
anything.
He's right.
You don't
owe me anything.
Never did.
All right...
you'll get over it.
You know they won't
give up the fight.
And neither will we.
Gotta do
what we gotta do.
That's right,
my friend.
What the hell
does he want?
Logan.
Can we talk?
Not really in a chatty
mood tonight, sir.
- It's important.
- Oy.
You heard the man.
You need to get
the hell out of here.
I'm not looking
for trouble.
Then you need to leave.
All right.
I'll go.
I'll catch you
in a few days, Logan.
Oy.
Forget him.
Forget who?

Ka pai girls,
it was beautiful.
Does anyone else have
a waiata,
or something to share?
Everyone.
I'm Josh.
I met Tori about,
four months ago when she,
first started coming
to our youth group.
She was a...
little forward at first,
but soon became
part of the furniture.
In fact, it wasn't long
before she was
bringing other people in,
making them feel
welcomed and valued.
She loved it.
We all loved her.
I can't believe she's gone.
In times like these, it's...
It's easy to ask why.
Why do bad things happen
to good people, and...
and to be honest,
I don't know.
I don't know why she died.
What I do know,
is that she truly impacted
the world around her.
And that impact will
have honored her absence.
I'd like to ask Jess
to come forward and
tell you all her story.
Jess?
Tori...
Tori saved my life.
The night she died
was the first time we'd met.
I'd never been
to church before,
so I was pretty nervous.
But Tori made me feel
like whanau.
She didn't know it,
but I had planned to
kill myself that night.
And if it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't be here today.
♪ I'd never be lost ♪
♪ I am a sea ♪
♪ One of greatness ♪
Ka pai Jess.
Thank you for sharing.
Finally,
Logan,
would you like to share?
Thank you for coming.
I know Tori meant a lot to you.
Tori was a good girl.
She was good
to those around her...
...even when they
weren't good to her.
She deserved a better life
than the one I gave her.
She deserved a better death...
...than the one they gave her.
Okay everyone,
let's finish
with a karakia.
That should be me
lying there.
Every part of me
wants them to pay,
for what they did to her.
And they will pay.
I hear you're good
with computers.
You reckon
you can hack into this?
Then get to it.
You let me know
as soon as you're in it.
Hey.
Keep an eye
on that guy.
I don't want him snooping
around on that thing.
You headin' out?
Yeah.
You want one of the boys
to come with you?
No.
Murphy.
Yeah.
They're all here.
We all know
why we're here.
Our revenge on the
Pouakai needs to be swift,
and it needs to be
permanent.
Permanent?
This is our chance
to take control for good.
Revenge is one thing.
But a complete takeover,
that's another.
Revenge isn't enough.
If we kill one of theirs,
they'll just kill
another one of ours.
And we'll get nowhere.
The only way
to stop them,
is to destroy them
completely.
Now, we've been at war with
the Pou for long enough.
It's time we take over
this town,
and claim it,
all of it,
- as Mad Bull turf.
- Murphy,
we all want
the same thing as you do,
but to take on the Pouakai,
I just don't think
we have the resources,
or can ready the manpower.
We find a way
to weaken them first.
We attack the head.
You won't get near Cruz.
He's pretty well-protected.
Then we strike him
where it hurts.
We hit his family.
Cruz doesn't have any family.
Yeah...
...he does.
You gonna leave
without saying goodbye?
I thought
you were sleeping.
I was.
Come.
Sit down.
It's nice to finally
see you again.
Yeah, well...
I heard
you weren't doing so good.
Oh, I'm fine.
They make these things out
to be much worse
than they really are.
- Do you reckon?
- I do.
I even manage
to sneak out of here
every once in a while.
Aw, have I missed
that smile.
Now,
tell me,
how are you?
I'm fine.
Are you?
Yeah,
had the flu
a couple of weeks back,
but I'm good now.
Cruz, honey,
I'm not your doctor,
how are you in here?
You know me, mum.
Yes I do.
In fact, I think I know you
better than you know yourself.
Is that right?
Oh, I know you kept
a lot of secrets from me,
about the world you live in.
But when I see you
as the man you are today...
I see the man
you will become.
The man
you were born to be.
Yeah, I know, mum,
I'm a big disappointment
to you.
But you know what,
I've done pretty good
for myself.
I know you have, son,
I know you have.
But you can't take it
with you, you know.
Yeah I know.
- Cruz.
- Yeah, I know, Mum.
What does it profit a man
if he gains the whole world,
and loses his soul.
Son.
After all this time...
...same old tune.
Cruz.
Sorry, Mum,
too for losing my soul.
She's death on a stick
out there, bro.
<i>Logan.</i>
<i>Here Dad,
this one's perfect.</i>
Help me.
Ah!
Evening, Dad.
I was just
in the neighborhood,
and thought I'd stop by.
How's it going?
I saw Mum today.
I'm sure she gets
more critical,
the older she gets.
I could be wrong.
I don't think she approves
of my life choices.
God knows why.
And now she doesn't
get in the hole.
But I've done
pretty damn well, you know.
You'd think
she'd be proud of me.
I reckon you would have
been proud of me.
You know, I don't blame you
for leaving.
Sometimes I wish
I could just...
...leave.
Cruz,
Cruz.
You shouldn't be out here
without protection.
What do you want, Axe?
Slater cracked the laptop.
And you left him
with it?
- Yeah, but I told him not to look at anything.
- Idiot.
- Morning.
- Yeah.
Got a moment?
Sorry for
the early visit.
Thought I'd catch you
before work.
I'm taking the day off.
I saw in the report,
you said the only thing taken,
was Victoria's laptop.
Have you noticed
anything else missing?
Just a necklace.
What sort of necklace?
A green stained cross.
It wasn't worth much.
It was her mother's.
Okay.
You also stated,
that you didn't recognize
the voice on the phone.
That's right.
Look, I get
the whole brotherhood thing.
But these guys
are not your brothers.
These are your enemies.
You crack it?
Then we're done here.
Any luck, my bro?
There's a whole bunch
of video files here.
I'll have to go through them.
You're gonna make sure
the boys are sorted.
The boys make a move,
I want to be ready.
Close that on your way out.
<i>Uh, hi.</i>
<i>Well, I'm Victoria,</i>
<i>Tori for short.</i>
<i>And this is my video diary.</i>
<i>Um... Yeah.</i>
<i>So recently I've kind of
turned over a new leaf,</i>
<i>and I figured, now is a great
time to start doing that.</i>
<i>So yeah,</i>
<i>Day one,</i>
<i>the first day of the
rest of my life, I guess.</i>
Hello, Logan.
Logan.
It's okay, dear.
I'm not scared.
Death comes for us all.
The question is,
will you be ready for it,
when it comes?
Unplug that thing.
We've gotta go.
Murphy,
we've got to go.
Hey, you two, stop there!
<i>I heard this great
quote the other night.</i>
<i>Forgiveness is the key,</i>
<i>that unlocks a door
of resentment,</i>
<i>and the handcuffs of hatred.</i>
<i>It is the power that breaks
the chains of bitterness,</i>
<i>and the shackles
of selfishness.</i>
<i>Man,</i>
<i>I definitely know
what those chains felt like.</i>
<i>I spent most of my life
angry and bitter,</i>
<i>and it ate me up.</i>
<i>But now those chains
are gone,</i>
<i>and I'm free,</i>
<i>like, truly free.</i>
Yeah.
What?
I'll be right there.
- What's going on?
- I've got to go.
Keep an eye on that thing.
Sorry, sir,
this room's off limits.
That's my mother in there.
I'll need to see
some ID.
Doc, how is she?
Mr. Taylor,
she's not in a good way.
Did she say
who attacked her?
She won't say.
You can go in
and see her.
She's been asking
for you.
Mum.
Mum.
Huh?
Is my boy?
Who done this to you?
It doesn't matter.
It matters to me.
You need to
forgive them, Cruz.
You need to forgive
everyone...
who's ever hurt you.
And you need to forgive
yourself.
Me.
It wasn't your fault
your father died.
You were just a boy.
Mum.
Mum.
Huh?
Promise me
you will forgive.
Something you need to see.
What's this?
Turn it on.
Seems Tori had
a private YouTube account.
Some sort of video diary.
You hold onto that.
<i>Uh, hi.</i>
<i>Well, I'm Victoria,</i>
<i>Tori for short.</i>
<i>And this is my video diary.</i>
<i>But things are getting
better around here, you know.</i>
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>he still blames himself
for Mum's death.</i>
<i>and fair enough, I guess.</i>
<i>You drive drunk and you
kill the person next to you.</i>
<i>How could you not
blame yourself?</i>
<i>But I forgive him.</i>
<i>And I can only hope
he learns to forgive himself.</i>
<i>So I really hope
he comes tonight.</i>
<i>I know church
isn't really his scene,</i>
<i>but you never know, right?</i>
<i>I mean, who would have ever
thought that I'd go to church?</i>
<i>Who would have ever thought
that I would find God.</i>
<i>See, miracles do happen.</i>
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>
- <i>Tor.</i>
- <i>Coming.</i>
<i>I've got to go.</i>
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>
What's going on?
- Everyone else is all ready.
- Ready for what?
Jack, bring the boys
around here to the west gate.
But you wait for my signal.
There he is.
- We need to talk.
- So where you been?
I had to sort my head.
You about done?
This is one fight
you can't win, Murph.
You getting cold feet
again, Logan?
Too late to back out now
anyway.
Killing the old girl
sealed the deal.
We don't even know
if we killed her.
The boys are ready.
Game on.
This is one game
I can't play.
You gotta do
what you gotta do.
Reckon we can
do this without him.
Tell the boys to roll out.
Left, left,
try to fight, stay.
With the body,
with the body.
Cut.
That's good work, boys,
good, good, good.
Good work on your slap,
everything off the jab.
You gotta keep busy.
Okay, lads,
take a break, yeah.
Good work.
I don't see a patch.
Coop.
- I owe you...
- I told you.
You don't owe me
anything.
Never have.
Thanks, Coop.
Why don't you unrope
for a circuit.
Cruz.
You need to know about
your mother...
I know.
I couldn't do it.
- So Murphy...
- Murphy didn't kill her.
Cancer killed her.
He just sped things up
a little.
Sorry, bro.
I guess
we both need forgiveness.
Tori really has talked
a lot about forgiveness.
It wasn't what she said
that got me.
It was the look
in her eyes.
She was truly free.
She changed a lot
in the last four months.
She wasn't the same girl
anymore.
She discovered the truth.
What truth?
The truth
that she was forgiven.
And because
she was forgiven...
she could forgive.
And it set her free.
Logan.
Murphy and the boys are
about to hit the Pouakai.
Cruz, this is Paulie.
Paulie,
you know who this is.
My bro here's
a little nervous,
because he heard about
your plan.
What plan?
Your plan to take out
Murphy and me.
News to me.
So what's the deal? When are
they planning to strike?
Tonight, before I saw it
on the post pad.
Yeah, Murphy's a lot braver
than I thought.
Stupid. Not brave.
Full on assault will end
in a blood bath.
I think that's what
he's going for.
We have to stop it.
Agreed.
You want me to come along?
Nah, bro.
You stay here.
We got this.
Cruz.
Murphy's told me about
that video file.
But straight up,
I don't have it.
Come on.
We got a war to stop.
I gotta sort things
at mine.
You head back,
I'll be right behind you.
Logan,
you know that plan
we talked about,
for the Pou's
to take you out.
Never heard of it before.
Alan, it's Logan.
I need your help.
Where's Axe?
We need to talk.
Oh. Sure it can wait.
No, Axe,
it can't wait.
Get up.
Hey, leave that there.
You might want to go easy.
Mad Bulls
are taking tonight.
Bring it on,
- 'bout time they made it...
- Axe,
a full-on war.
Last man standing wins.
Then let's make sure
we're the last men standing.
And the boys?
If they can't hold
their own.
You don't care
if they die?
Oh, and you do?
What's the matter,
Cruz?
You getting soft on us
since Mummy died.
That's right.
I knew your little secret.
I knew all along.
All that God stuff,
just as well she's dead.
Ah.
That's the Cruz
we know and love.
We ain't going to war
with the Bulls.
Yeah, we are.
Sorry, mate,
you're getting old.
And it's out with old...
and in with the new.
They're already gone.
Okay, listen,
you stay here.
Paulie, stay here.
You think if you kill me,
they gonna follow you.
I've been waiting
a long time for this.
Hey, hurry up.
Not bad
for an old man.
Go on.
Do it.
Do it.
I ain't gonna kill you,
Axe.
But it looks like
you're gonna get your war.
Pouakai.
I've been leading you
for nearly 20 years.
Tonight you're expecting me
to lead you in this war.
But this ends,
right here,
right now.
This is not happening.
Yeah, it is.
Bet when you woke up
this morning,
you didn't think that today
was gonna be your last.
Death comes
for us all, Murphy.
Question is,
are you ready when it comes?
I seem to remember your mother
saying something like that.
Right before I killed her.
Say hi to her
from me.
This has to stop.
You lied to me.
How else was I supposed
to get you to come back?
We don't need him.
Just say the word.
Killing him
wasn't part of the plan.
Why not?
We killed
his daughter.
And he's no good to us now.
You didn't kill Tori.
They killed Tori.
Looking for their video file.
There is no video file.
Start a fire...
you need a match.
And look at
this baby burn.
Look, I didn't think they
were gonna kill Tori for it.
That was...
unfortunate.
"Unfortunate."
Stop!
You want to listen to him?
He's weak.
Murphy.
It doesn't have to end
like this.
Actually, Logan,
I think it does.
You gotta do,
what you gotta do.
This looks familiar.
Oh, yeah.
Like father,
like daughter.
Looks like I win.
Pulling a trigger
ain't winning.
Get up fools, get up!
Aah!
Halt, police!
Halt, police!
Keep your hands
where I can see them!
Drop the gun!
Drop your weapon,
get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!
Thought you'd be
out surfing.
'Bout to head out.
Just wanted to see
how you're doing.
I'm surviving.
How's Cruz?
Recovering well.
You know, Logan...
she would be proud
of you, man.
Well, I'm off.
Looks like a much better
day for a wave.
You should
go and enjoy it.
Alan.
Thanks.
<i>I heard this
great quote the other night.</i>
<i>Forgiveness is the key that
unlocks the door of resentment,</i>
<i>and the handcuffs of hatred.</i>
<i>It is the power that breaks
the chains of bitterness,</i>
<i>and the shackles
of selfishness.</i>
<i>I definitely know what
those chains felt like.</i>
<i>I spent most of my life
angry and bitter,</i>
<i>but now those chains are gone.</i>
<i>And I'm free,</i>
