Chances are
'Cause I wear a silly grin
The moment you come into view
Chances are yo u think that
I'm in love with you
Just because
My composure sort of slips
The moment that your lips meet mine
Chances are you 'll think my heart 's
Your valentine
In the magic of moon light
Chances are you believe the stars
That fill the skies
Are in my eyes
Guess you feel you 'll always be
The one and only one for me
And if you think you could
Well, chances are your chance are
Awfully good
Louie?
There's something I have to tell you.

when Representative Howard Smith...
announced a meeting

In view of the testimony
of the witness...
and the arguments of councel...
I've decided to grant the defendant's
motion to suppress the evidence,
Permission to approach the bench ,
judge Fenwick,
Approach.
Your Honor, I won 't have a case.
Without that evidence, the counts
against Tony Bonino are out the window,
I have to follow
the rules of evidence, Louie,
In my judgment,
a search warrant was required...
and therefore the evidence
is inadmissible,
But he'll be back on the streets, and we
both know Bonino is one of the most...
cunning and powerful individuals
in organized crime,
Are you through?
Court is adjourned,
Listen ,I've got something here,
- lt 's a tip or something.
- Yeah ? What is it?
- Something on Bonino,
- Bonino?
Interested. huh?
Yes, I'm interested.

So you just assume that nobody
at Yale Universlty or Yale Law School, ,.
had any interest in checking out
these six books,.,
in the last three months?
- l just--
- You are going to make some lawyer,
You owe $87.25
$87.25?

Cash only, or we'll

and I can't get my grades.
My ride's waiting.
What?
This is bad.

- How worse?
- A Iot.
According to this, these books

Yeah? So?
So it means that I can't
charge you for them.
You beat the system.

We're not ready.
Richard, calm down,
it's just the panic before the storm.
Corinne, EIeanor RooseveIt's wig

What? lt's got to be here.
I'm sure we'Il flnd it.
- Mamie Eisenhower's hair might work.

Let me think. Have you checked

No, I'm on my way.

I know, I have to go.
Be carefuI, sweet heart. Bye.
You were right.
Maintenance had it.
- Great.
- And look what I found.

- Jackie Kennedy's earrings.
They were with the dinosaur teeth.
Inventory got 'em mixed up
when we switched buiIdings.
You shouId have been
a First Lady.
I was once.
- Can l go?
- Sure.
I'lI see you tomorrow morning
at 6:00.

You're right.
I'II see you at 6:30.
6:30.
Good night, Joe.
See ya, John.
Ms. Jeffries.
Hi, handsome.
I'm having those dreams again.
The X-rated ones with Louie?
Dr. BaiIey, you'd be shocked.
How have you been feeIing?
Fantastic.
It was Louie's birthday
on Saturday.
l baked him a cake
with littIe cherries in it.
I thought we agreed that you
were going to stop cooking for Louie.
It was his birthday.
It makes me happy to feed him.
The Egyptians fed their dead.
Not after 23 years.
Now, when you
first came to me...
you told me that you wanted
to free yourseIf...
from your attachment to Louie...
that you wanted to move on, that you
wanted to experience Iove again.
And we agreed that that meant...
a fruitful relationship...
with a man who has a body.
Now, can you do that much?
Can you refrain
from these activities...
that perpetuate your fantasy?
I'II try.
Here's your favorite,
Peppermint Patty, Good night.
He raised a gull-like cry
in the air.
The air she bIows!
The air she bIows!
A hump Iike a snow hiIl !
It is Moby Dick!
A Mr. AIex Finch

Mr. BradIee doesn't know who you are.

May I heIp you ?
Can I try him?
Goodbye.
Excuse me,
I was wondering if Mr. Bradlee...

HoId it.

Good morning.
Oh, good. You're here.

AIex Finch.

He's very hot.

Woodward and Bernstein.
At Ieast taIk to him, Ben.
Okay, Finch. Wait outside.
Right.
Thank you.
Mr. BradIee wiII see you now.
I'm sorry, Finch.
Did you read the one
about the kitchen workers strike?
lf l hired you, the guys in this office
would eat you for breakfast.
BeIieve me, you need experience.
Contacts, find work
on a smaII-town paper.
Then when you've paid your dues,
know your way around...

Thanks anyway.
BradIee doesn't know everything.
Hi, PhiIip Train.
Hi, PhiIip Train ?

I have a car,
I can give you a ride.
I'd be honored, sir.
I've Iived in Washington

She used to caII me PeeIeep.
Anyway, I just got out
of mistake number two.
Turn Ieft up here.
Sorry.
What are you doing for dinner?
Dinner?
You're coming with me.
My friends live just down the street.
Coming?
Yeah.
Hello, hello.
Nobody home.
Nice house.
Hi, Philip.
Hello, honey,

- This is incredibIe.
You know each other?
Someone should start dinner,
I'Il do it.
- Get him a drink.
- Come in.
- What are you doing here?
- I came down to get a job at The Post.
- How did it go?
- Terribly.
But things
are definitely picking up.
I started today, I'm interning
for this judge this summer.
That's great.
First in her cIass in law school.
Second...
skipped high school entirely.
Skipped a year.
l'm home!
We're out here.
Mom.
Sweet heart.
That smells delicious.
Sorry I'm Iate.
We spent four hours
Iooking for Dolly Madison's arm.
You have to poke holes in them.
Otherwise they expIode.
- Sorry, Mom.
- This is my friend, AIex Finch.
Hi.
- Have we met before?
- I don't think so.
He's staying for dinner.
He's homeless.
Oh, wonderful.
I'lI go change
and be right back.
She's a curator
at the Smithsonian.
And your dad?
He died before I was born.
Sorry.
And Philip's my godfather.
He's your mom's boyfriend.
WeII, unfortunateIy, my mother
never reaIly got over my father.
Look at this. Come here.
That's my dad.
Miranda, where's that corn ?
- What kind of Iawyer do you want to be?
- A public defender.
Supreme Court justice.
I Iike to fight.
- You better get some more ice.
- I'lI get it.
Thanks.
Thanks, AIex
- What do you think?
- I Iike him.
I think we'II caII the tree George.
Aren't they beautiful?
That didn't happen.
That's fine.
My bowl...
What's that doing here?
''Corinne RandoIph and Louie Jeffries
joined in holy matrimony, May 18, 1963.
Do you Louie Jeffries...

to be your lawful wedded wife?
What a coincidence.
That's a coincidence.
That's a coincidence.
Uncle Marsh.
Who the heIll's uncIe Marsh?
Who is he?
John Marshall Jeffries.
Oh, good.
- Alex?
- Hold on !
- Corn ?
- Thank you.
Oh, honey, wouId you get
the IittIe siIver corn hoIders, please?
What corn holders?
In the side board,
second drawer down on the right.
So they are.
Good guess.
Alex, what does your father do?
He runs a dry cIeaning establishment.
It's called Finch's Easy Cean ,
He specializes mostly
in goose down and suede, ,.
and, you know, fine fabrics.
He's thinking about expanding
into fur storage,
I said, ''Dad, that's not a good idea,
because you don t have the, ,,
experience,''
Come on. Louie.
Peek a boo !
Easy on the vino,
Is everything all right?
Excuse me,
Oh , my God !

All those things he was saying,
All that running around,
He's had a rough day,
He's just a littIe stressed,
Trust me,
Ok, but make sure
your bedroom door is locked,
Towels.
Are you sure that it's all right,

Yeah,you're we come to stay

You didn't mess it up,
You brough t it to life,
Have you had a happy life?
Yeah, I guess so,

Yes, he was,
He was generlly fond of fruit,
- He was handsome and witty too.

A man of high i deals.
Yes, He was all those things,
Miranda left these for you ,
You should help your self to anything
to eat and make your self at home,
Excuse me,
Dreaming of Louie
every night this week.
My psychlatrist says I suffer
from the halo effect,.,
a tendency of widows
to idealize their dead housbands.
He says it keeps me
from falling in love again.
He has a point, but I can 't imagine
I 'll ever stop loving Louie,
Corinne,
You'll never believe this, but--
Corinne, this may come
as a shock to you--
Hi,
- Morning,
- Morning,
- I m here to see Mrs Jeffries, please,
- She's in a meeting,
Are you the caterer?
I m an old friend,
just have a seat,
She won 't be long.
Thank s.
I've developed the fine art
of reading between the lips,.,
and I see nothing but butter cups
on the horizon ,
No one is happy about it, They won 't
bend the rules this time, my dear,
Not even for you.
It is eight hours before the opening,
and they want to fire me?
Corinne, we are
two miIIion dolIars in the hoIe,
and it was you who insisted,
and I quote,
"The American people maintain
an insatiabIe curiosity about that,
ecIectic group of women
who fashion everything,
from foreign poIicy
to hemIines at home."
- l stiII beIieve that.
- Fine, but we've got to pay back,
the museum's emergency found,
so that some other department
can have an emergency.
- l know that.
- By Friday.
Friday? But it's Wednesday,
that's impossibIe.
Now Iook...
Remember that friend of mine
who l hate, Mavis TaImadge?
- Yes,
- WelI, tonight, at the opening...
- I want you to put the squeeze on Mavis.
- Why can't you ?
Cause Mavis TaImadge is not someone
I'd care to squeeze.
No one in Washington
is as rich as Mavis.
She's her own corporation,
her own.
I and mass,
Mavis Talmadge is the way to go.
I don't want to bother her,
and l don't feel weII. I'II come back.
AIex, Hi.
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?
I wish you'd toId me you were coming,
l couId have arranged a private tour.
Come on in.
This is gonna sound funny, but I
didn't come here to see the museum.
This is gonna sound funny, but I
didn't come here to see the museum.
- l came to see you.
- Oh?
l hope you didn't come here
to apoIogize about Iast night.
No, l came to taIk
about something eIse.
- I'm Louie.
- What?
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
You're not gonna beIieve me,
but there's something you shouId know.
AIlright...
Our rain forests are being destroyed
at a rate of 50 acres a minute!
AIex, do you want to borrow money?
Is this about Miranda?
Part...
I'm reaIly sorry, but I have
a Iunch date in a few minutes.
Look into my eyes.
Does anything seem famiIiar?
- I beg your pardon ?
- It's me.
Louie.
I'm back.
l wasn't drunk last night at dinner.
When I saw you
and I saw the house,
my memory came back
of my Iast life.
- What are you taIking about?
- With you.
I got my memory back,
and I reaIized that I was Louie.
I am Louie.
I got recycIed.
You Iook great by the way.
I know it's hard to beIieve.
l mean, I can't.
Try to see.
Get out of my office.
Get out.
- Hi, AIex.
- Hi.
- Are you feeling better?
- Yeah, can we sit down and taIk?
- Are you feeling better?
- Yeah, can we sit down and taIk?
- I taIked to BradIee.
- Yeah ?
About you.
BottomIine is,
he won't hire a rookie.
But I've got friends, editors...
Why are you going out of your way
for me? You hardIy know me.
I don't know...
Maybe it's like,
with someone speciaI,.
you know that feeIing
that you have.
Like a confidante or maybe
you know, a best friend?
You want a beer?
Sure.
Miranda's Ieft moIar.
That's my Miranda file.
It's beautifuI.
You realIy do Iike her, don't you?
- You look Iike a famiIy.
- WeII. We are aImost...
just without some of the usuaI
conventions of marriage, sex.
So you and Mrs Jeffries
have never been together?
But you love her.
HopeIessly.
In aII these years
you've never touched her...
and you've never toId her?
You don't know Corinne,
She's wired differentIy.
She's not Iike other women.
The sIightest push
in the wrong direction might...
I don't want to rush her.
You've done the right thing.
Well, I've tried to take care
of Miranda and Corinne...
the way I imagine Louie would have,
That's Louie,
with the skinny legs,
Not that skinny.
You're not gonna beIieve this,
but..
Sorry, excuse me.
HeIIo? Oh, hi,
Research.
I better go.
Thanks.
Oh, my God.
This's your first time as a human ?
What?
I m getting a strong...
German shepherd vibration.
I used to be a Iawyer.
CIose.
Do you know about past Iives?
We're aII connected,
It's aII connected under the skin.
You never know who's lurking
in what body.
Your wife couId be
your granfather.
You meet some guy
who gets on your nerves,
it's probably your mother-in-Iaw.
We keep meeting the souIs
we're attached to for better
or worse,
Iife after Iife.
Sometimes I wonder,
why I worry
about past Iives at aIl ,
I'm having so much troubIe
with this one.
When you remember your past lives,
it's Iike your emotions,
get spread,
Iike a dangIing nerve,
aII over the map,
It makes it very hard to live.
I know.
Who were you?
No one speciaI.
We're alI speciaI.
I wasn't CIeopatra or Hannibal
or someone great or famous.
I know you weren't CIeopatra,
I was.
I don't want him in this house.
Mom, you don't make any sense.
Why aII of a sudden
does he have to Ieave?
l have my reasons.
End of conversation.
What do you mean?
What has he done?
He's...weird.
Mom, weirdness is not
a criminal offense.
If it were, you'd be serving
a Iife sentence.
We don't know a thing about him,
he's a stray off the street.
- He could be a...
- YaIegrad.
Look. Once again I Iike someone
of whom you don't approve...
for your own pecuIiar
and inexpIicabIe reasons.
So you order him out Iike some
Latin American generaIissimo.
Where's my Iife in aII of this?
l'm tired of trying to find someone
who fits into your notion of Mr.Right.
He's not Daddy.
Nobody is.
He's Ieaving, and that's final.
Now you go right downstairs
and teII him.
You telI him.
AIl right.
I wiII.
- Alex.
- Mom?
You look fabuIous
in Daddy's tux.
I'lI get the car, Mom.
AIl the First Ladies were
fascinating individuaIs.
Lou Hoover was a shot put champion,
a geoIogy major at Stanford,
and an accompIished Iinguist.
She and Herbert used to converse
in Chinese.
This is Lady Bird.
Southern democrats were furious with
L.B,j, for his stand on civil rights,
so he sent his wife
to campaign for him,
knowing fuII welI no Southern gentIeman
couId refuse to greet a Southern lady.
Fascinatin'.
- Something wrong?
- No, EIeanor Roosevelt is my favorite.
She wore this the night
of the President's inauguration.
At his request, they had a concert
at Constitution HaII instead of a balI.
We want peopIe to know
that the First Ladies,
were so much more than
their china and dresses.
Oh, thank you.
- Aren't you goin'  to introduce us?
- Mrs TaImadge.
This's AIex Finch,
a friend of my daughter's.
May I have this dance?
Here.
- May l have this dance?
- PhiIip !
Where are we going?
I take it it's something urgent
and top secret?
lt's very important.
AIl right.
Do you think it's possibIe
for Louie to come back?
Oh, Corinne, we're not going
to go to another seance?
I mean in another person's body.
I have no idea,
but somehow I don't think so.
- Why are we discussing this?
- lt's an interesting question.
Let's ask Mrs.Lincoln, Mary?
I'm serious.
WeII. So am I.
I can understand how a person's desires
might Iead her to beIieve that.
It'd be a dream come true.
But the Iast guy to come back
that I know about was Jesus Christ.
You'lI see Louie someday.
I know. In heaven.
Why don't you find yourseIf
a girIfriend? You're so good-Iooking.
- So we're in agreement, Mrs.TaImadge?
- Mavis.
America's First Ladies deserve
a pIace in history,
as much as some of the dopes
they married.
Sure, they had the officiaI power,
but the reaI power lies
behind the scenes,
with women...Iike you.
Two miIIion doIlars wilI save
this exhibit,
and the whole worId wiII discover
America's First Ladies,
ln the aII-new
Mavis TaImadge PaviIion.
An exceIIent choice,
Happy anniversary.
There you are.
- Dance with me.
- I'm a Iousy dancer.
You've never had the right partner.
Where did you Iearn
to dance Iike that?
Inherited it from my dad.
They're supposed to be down.
Now you're mine.
Oh, my goodness! What happened?
- Excuse me.
- Mrs. TaImadge?
StiIl ticking.
Move back!
Move back. Everyone, pIease, get back !
- Stand back!
- Oh, my God!
- What happened?
- I don't know...
- I hope she's alI right.
- Oh, she's fine.
She's got a strong spirit,
she'II be aIl right.
What are you taIking about?
She's practicaIIy dead.
Oh, dead, but that's just her body.
Which... let's face it,
is no big Ioss. In the Iong run...
- What are you taIking about?
- She'lI come back,
PeopIe come back again and again.
For instance, I couId've been someone
that you knew before.
- Yeah.
- Someone that you Ioved.
Let s go.
I couId've been your father.
- I have to taIk to you.
- Get... Get off me!
Only if you promise to listen
to what l have to say.
Don't break that,
it was Father's,
Good night.
You win. Good night.
Just reIax, I'II leave.
Sorry, but this is important.
I had a pair of diamond earrings
with me the day l died.
They were for you,
for our anniversary.
- How do you know about those?
- I bought 'em from Mr. ZelIerbach ,
How do you think I know?
I know everything about you.
You Iove peanut butter,
rhubarb and cats with yeIIow eyes.
You're a psychic, or one of
ShirIey MacLaine's books!
- You love Johnny Mathis.
- Get out of here...
before I scream so loud everybody
in the neighborhood comes,
and I have you arrested
for impersonating a person !
I know you did the Watusi before.
Remember?
Remember this?
Good night.
Oh, I forgot.
This is for you.
Are you okay?
- What's the matter?
- Down here.
What?
I haven't done it in 23 years.
What?
That's...That's...It's okay.
It's like riding a bike,
you never...you never forget.
You know, don't worry, Corinne.
Baby, can you please open this door,
because I'm reaIIy...
Oh, God,
Good night.
Oh, damn.
Hi, darIin'.
Shh, mom's next door.
- What are you doing here?
- What does it Iook like?
- What?
- It's way past your bedtime.
- Go to your room.
- What is wrong with you?
- Is it me?
- No, it's not you.
Yes, it's you,
but it's not ''you'' you.
- Look, if you're not interested...
- I am interested.
I'm very interested.
It's not that I'm not interested,
it's...
Is there someone eIse?
- Huh ?
- Yeah.
God...
just pretend this didn't happen.
God...
Good morning.
l thought we couId have a picnic today
on the maII
maybe take in the LincoIn Memorial.
l can't, I have to work tomorrow.
I have this triaI to sit in on.
I just don't have time.
- It'd be fun.
- Sorry.
WeII, maybe some other time, maybe...
Maybe.
Thanks for thinking of me.
Dr. Bailey...
I came here to teII you that
I'm interested in someone,
a man,
weII , he's aImost a man...
What do you mean?
He's onIy 22 years old.
But it's not Iike I'm rushing into
anything, l've known him for 26 years.
It's a IittIe compIicated.
Is this someone that
you've toId me about before?
We only met three days ago.
But you just said that
you've known him 26 years.
WelI, he used to be
a different person.
He's changed a Iot.
Oh, Dr. Bailey....
I don't know if it's just his body
I'm attracted to or his souI ...
or if it's just me.
I'm feeIing...
generaIIy...
attractive.
Truth is...
I'm so ripe
I'm about to faIl off the vine.
Uh, weII, I feeI this is
a very positive step.
Now, I sense some hesitation...
in entering into a reIationship...
with a younger man.
But this is perfectIy naturaI.
Society inhibits us
but feeIings are feeIings...
and you are crassing
a very important th reshold.
We used to Iove to come here.
You and l...
Louie and I...
Do you remember?
What do you remember?
It's kind of like a dream coming back...
bits and pieces.
But I especialIy remember peopIe that
I reaIIy Iove, Iike you and PhiIip.
Thanks.
Come on.
- Here you go.
- Thanks, how much?
Oh, that's aII right, ma'am.
Your son aIready paid.
- What was Miranda Iike at ten ?
- At ten ?
Precocious, opinionated,
fierceIy independent.
She got braces then,
which she removed with pIiers...
after wearing them
for about an hour.
PhiIip toId her, ''AII great beauties
must suffer and sacrifice"
You !
Hi.
I wanna have at Ieast two more.
Babies?
It's not too Iate, is it?
Can we start tonight?
Are you sure?
I asked him "Is there anybody eIse?''
and he said yes.
- That's pretty compelIing evidence.
- He admired your moIar.
- What?
- Yesterday at my house...your X-rays.
One minute he's there with you,
and the next minute...
l think I'm in Iove with him,
I know lt's ridicuIous,
I've onIy known him a few days...
but l've never feIt this way
for anybody before.
If he asked me to marry him,
I'd say yes.
The weird thing is, he treats me
like l'm five, Iike I'm his daughter.
Don't give up,
these things take time.
BeIieve me...
What?
Why don't you just attack mom
once and for aIl and get it over with?
ls that you ?
What's he doing here?
- What are you doing?
- Hi.
Creating the most spectacular
veaI parmigiana.
Soon ,
I'm gonna go take a coId shower.
Miranda caIIed, she's gonna be
working Iate tonight.
Can I heIp?
God, you look beautifuI.
PhiIip, you got a haircut.
- What's the occasion ?
- You.
Oh, PhiIip !
Oh, God.
TeIl him about the time you were
a goriIIa at Miranda's birthday party.
- Scared them to death.
- lt was so funny.
I think we'II spare him that one.
How am I doing?
More champagne, cheri?
You've outdone yourseIf. This is one of
the greatest meaIs I've ever had.
Thank you.
l'lI drink to that.
You must be exhausted,
you look exhausted.
- I wish you didn't have to go.
- Me too.
Thanks for everything.
See ya, feeI better.
My dessert, my peach cobbler.
Thanks.
- PhiIip !
- It's not what you think!
That's good
you smarmy IittIe bastard.
This is not what you think!
It's something else entireIy.
AIex is Louie reincarnated.
I didn't beIieve it either
at first.
- Isn't it a miracle?
- He told you that?
Pass yourseIf off as her dead husband
in another body,
very cute.
Look...
- Stop it!
- Get off!
Stop!
I am Louie!
PhiIip, it's true! It's me!
He can prove it.
Go on , honey.
Oh , spare me, honey. Corinne,
He's got you figured out,
AlI he wants is your money,
You're wrong,
He wants my body.
l'm Louie!
Yeah , and I'm Cleopatra,
You're not...
Stop it!
You fight like her,
Damn it! Stop it!
Listen ! Listen.
you stubborn son of a bitch ,
The day Corinne and l got married,
you told me you were in Iove with her,
Are you CIA,?
You deny it?
Oh , look,, ,
I'm just a dumb newspaperman ,
I beIieve Monday follows Sunday,
I believe summer follows spring,
l beIieve in God and gIasnost.
I beIieve in things you can touch ,
ln my whole life. I have, ,,
never met a more devious,
more clever scoundrel,
Now get outta here
before I throw you out,
why did you do that?
He tried to kill me!
He s twice your age and in his heart
attack years! You couId've killed him !
He' s just passed out.
How could you ?
Whose side are you on?
Yours,
but I couId never have made it., ,
through the Iast 23 years
without PhiIip.
He's sleeping Iike a baby, Can't--
I am old enough to be your mother,
Now go to your room, Alex!
Go to my room?
Oh. Philip,
Dear PhiIip,
If anything ever happened
to you , I...
l must 've been out of my mind.
Forgive me, my darling.
I'll be there at midnight.
Come on , SIeeping Beauty,
Oh, God,
Shoes off,
What?
Oh , Louie,
What are you doing here?
I'm not sure,
- Whatever just happened was...
- A miracIe.
- We aImost...We could've...
- We stiII can.
I have to go!
Good night,
l'm not gonna Iet you go,
What are you doing?
l'm finding out what it feels Iike
to hoId the woman I Iove,.,

tilI the day I die,
I Iove you , Corinne,
Why didn't you ever teIl me?
- How couId I?
- AIl these years,

The cIerk wiII caIl the case.

I know about you and Anthony Bonino.
It's aIl right,
Step aside,
So, stiII on the take?
I don't know who you are or what you

word or you'Il be in big troubIe,
I worshiped you, you son of a bitch,
You let Bonino waIk,
MarshaIs, step him back!
He suppressed evidence,, ,
against Tony Bonino!
- My God.

Oh, God,
It's not that I don't Iove you ,
I do, I always wilI ,
But., ,
peopIe change,
Not as much as you generaIIy, but--
We've both changed,
You're just not my husband anymore,
Last night, I found out something about
myself  that I never wouId've known., ,
lf it wasn't for you--
that I Iove Philip,
I onIy hope with my whoIe heart
that someday you'II forgive me,, ,
forgive us,
Oh, darling, can you hear
anything I'm saying?
Excuse me, ma'am.
lt's time for his injection.
Just a little something
you should've had a long time ago,
I feel better now,
Where the hell am I?
ln the hospital
with us,
Do you know who I am?
You're  Mrs Jeffries,
You're  Miranda's mother,
Everything  will be fine.
Hey, pal ,
You gave us quite a scare,
How' s your head?
It's still on, I  think,
Hi.
You don't remember any of it?
Last thing I remember is
Philip inviting me for dinner, ,.
and you and I getting the corn
out of the refrigerator,
It gets a little foggy after that
but I think it was
something like this,
What about that other girl
you're seeing?
What other girl ?
Flnch, where did you get
that picture?
I can't reveal my source,
l mean, I really can't,
You're a tough nut to crack.
You'll make one hell of a reporter,
Start Monday,
You look so beautiful ,
Ok, it's time,
Come on,
Philip's waited long enough ,
- Mrs, Jeffries?
- Yes, Alex?
I'm gonna go get the bouquets,
l just want to say congratuIations,
You and Philip make a great pair,
Thanks, Alex,
You know, you're the first boyfriend
of Miranda's I ever really liked,
- Yeah ?
- I have to tell you something,
Now ?
I'm in love with Miranda,
I know,
Dearly beloved, we have come together
in the presence of God, ,,
to witness and bless--
