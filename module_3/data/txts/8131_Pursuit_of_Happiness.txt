I'm doing a walk...
around Texas...
of 3,200 miles...
uh, for the sesquicentennial,
uh, celebration...
of 150th birthday ofTexas.
<i>And why are you doing it?</i>
<i>And why Texas?</i>
Uh, this is my home now...
and, uh, because I like it.
<i>[Man Narrating] Vasily Bolos</i>
<i>escaped from Romania a few years ago...</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>A lot of poor people in this country.</i>
It shouldn't be. In this rich country,
we shouldn't have poor people.
<i>And some people think that, uh,</i>
<i>immigrants are taking their jobs.</i>
Uh, what's probably helping
immigrants take their jobs...
is 'cause they're anxious to work...
Yeah, I think we come
with a lot of dreams...
and we work as hard as we can
to achieve it.
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>My name is Louis Malle.</i>
<i>I didn't walk, like Vasily Bolos...</i>
<i>but for three months</i>
<i>I rambled around this country...</i>
<i>filming some of the millions</i>
<i>who have come to America recently...</i>
<i>to fulfill their dreams...</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>January 1986, Kennedy Airport.</i>
<i>These Cambodian refugees</i>
<i>are survivors...</i>
<i>of the worst genocide</i>
<i>our planet has known since World War II.</i>
<i>They come from camps in Thailand</i>
<i>where thousand of their compatriots...</i>
<i>are waiting for a future.</i>
[Man]
Take this, go to the inspector.
Can I see your travel documents?
<i>No? Okay.</i>
Thank you.
<i>How 'bout-</i>
<i>Can I see this one here?</i>
[Woman Giggling]
- Ooh. Got some food here.
- <i>[Man] Just rice.</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>A little cultural difference here.</i>
- She's got a - She's got more -
- <i>For the U.S. Customs, it is microbes.</i>
This is the, uh, stuff from the plane.
What country are they coming from now?
<i>Uh- They are from Cambodia.</i>
Yeah, I know, but what country
are they coming from now?
<i>[Speaking Foreign Language]</i>
- Chon Buri.
- <i>Chon Buri in Thailand.</i>
<i>Thailand. By way of France?</i>
<i>Are they coming from Raris?</i>
<i>[Speaking Foreign Language]</i>
- <i>They don't know. They don't know.</i>
- <i>[Woman Laughing]</i>
They're off the D8-41.
Where's that from?
- <i>8- 41. That was from Italy.</i>
- Yeah, they're coming from Rome.
All right.
- <i>All right. They're all set. Thank you.</i>
- Thank you.
[Customs Officer]
Bye-bye.
<i>[Baby Crying]</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>It's very cold today.</i>
<i>Outside the gates,</i>
<i>friends welcome them.</i>
<i>As soon as possible,</i>
<i>they must find a job, make money...</i>
<i>first of all, learn the language.</i>
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>You must be short of money...</i>
<i>if you only work three days a week.</i>
<i>[Group Repeating]</i>
<i>You must be short of money...</i>
if you only work
three days a week.
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Let's go to Wendy's and have a hamburger.</i>
Let's go to Wendy's
and have a hamburger.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
<i>Good. I'll treat you this time.</i>
I'll treat you this time.
Next month, you can treat me.
You can treat me.
This time I pay.
Next time you pay.
<i>That's all it means.</i>
<i>It's really very simple.</i>
Wendy?
Where you buy the hamburgers.
<i>You can go to McDonald's</i>
<i>or Burger King.</i>
- <i>[Man Talking, Indistinct]</i>
- <i>Anywhere.</i>
You must be short of money...
if you only "weeks"
three days a week.
Let's go to... Wendy's...
and have a hamburger.
Sorry. I'm out of money.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Before driving a cab in Dallas, Texas...</i>
<i>Admen Malaq</i>
<i>was a freedom fighter...</i>
<i>in the mountains of Kurdistan.</i>
Well, all the drivers, uh -
and, uh, got the idea
of having our own company...
and more of, uh, you know -
it's like working for yourself
instead of working for somebody else.
<i>Now that, uh, we all got together</i>
<i>at meetings...</i>
<i>and finally we got the company-</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Drivers from Africa and the Middle East...</i>
<i>have joined forces to start</i>
<i>their own business - the American way.</i>
- <i>[Rhone Rings]</i>
- <i>[Woman] Good afternoon. Liberty Taxi.</i>
2300 block? What's the address?
- [Man On Radio, Indistinct]
- <i>Okay. Thank you for calling.</i>
- [Phone Rings]
- Okay, number eight.
I need you to copy
the 3000 block of Mockingbird.
[Phone Rings]
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>They're not even in the phone book yet.</i>
<i>They operate from a couple of rooms,</i>
<i>but like all immigrants...</i>
<i>they have great expectations</i>
<i>and the determination to succeed.</i>
<i>Your balance is $65.</i>
Well, my name is Gideon Odjari...
and I come from Ghana, West Africa,
originally.
When I got down here to Texas,
I started driving taxi on a part-time basis.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Gideon is the president of Liberty Cab.</i>
<i>He has a business degree</i>
<i>from the University of Michigan.</i>
And that was how I was able to,
you know, fight them in competition.
- And top light.
- <i>Top light. I have a top light for sale.</i>
<i>That is $35.</i>
- <i>And, um -
- Is it complete or-
<i>A complete one is $38.</i>
Okay. I agree with 38.
Everybody owns one share
in the company...
and entitled to the profits
of the company.
<i>Each driver is entitled</i>
<i>to one vote.</i>
<i>[Gideon]</i>
<i>It's going to take at least two more weeks.</i>
- <i>[Man] I need to order a new one, man.</i>
- I know. It's gonna be two more -
You know, we have a lot of people
that wants to be part of this company.
<i>But, uh, we hope that the number</i>
<i>will go up to about 400...</i>
<i>within the next three, four months.</i>
I'm from Ethiopia.
<i>[Malle]</i>
<i>Do you like it here?</i>
Yeah, it's all right. It's okay.
Yeah, I miss my country.
It was, for me, very, very peculiar,
very strange.
Everything money.
Money, money, money, money.
From morning to evening,
everybody talking about money...
Okay. Now, when I clap my hands -
<i>[Malle Narrating] Boris Leskin</i>
<i>was one of the best-known stage actors...</i>
<i>in the Soviet Union.</i>
<i>[Leskin]</i>
<i>Talk to yourself. Talk.</i>
<i>I didn't speak English at all.</i>
Of course,
it was very difficult time...
now is beginning my second life.
Not another, but second life.
And one, and two...
<i>[Malle Narrating] Working in</i>
<i>a foreign language is tough for an actor.</i>
<i>And there are not too many jobs</i>
<i>in Hollywood sitcoms...</i>
<i>for a 60-year-old Russian genius</i>
<i>with an accent.</i>
Satisfaction?
<i>[Leskin] Of course I miss my friends</i>
<i>who worked with me 20 years...</i>
<i>in the same company...</i>
<i>in the best theater</i>
<i>in the world, I think.</i>
And four.
In Russia I was enough famous, rich.
I have a car.
It's a big privilege in the Soviet Union.
<i>I desperately need glass of water.</i>
<i>Very thirsty.</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Boris has no regrets.</i>
<i>He devotes his energy</i>
<i>to teaching young American actors...</i>
<i>the real Stanislavski.</i>
Unroll your body.
Unfold your shoulder.
Tremendous, huge -
<i>[Leskin]</i>
<i>Unfortunately, in the United States -
It's my opinion, of course.
Somebody use Stanislavski's method
not very clear.
They use only one part
of his method.
Gentlemen, this lady.
Everybody remember how to do?
Charity, please. Left hand down.
Okay? And projection
through your body, but you feel it.
And I full of desire,
full of crave.
I want something. I want to be in a movie.
I want to be involved.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>I know exactly what Boris is talking about.</i>
<i>There's something irresistible about coming</i>
<i>to America and starting all over again.</i>
Nobody thinking about me.
But now it's everything up to me.
For revenge.
For revenge lady beat him. Okay?
Project.
What's the reason you beat him?
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Rublic School 89 in Queens, New York.</i>
- <i>[Bell Rings]</i>
- <i>[Woman] What is the Stamp Act?</i>
What is that, Hi Mon Shu?
Whatever they do,
they have to have a stamp.
<i>And to whom do they pay the money?</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Children of 17 different nationalities...</i>
<i>are taught American history</i>
<i>by a teacher born in the Rhilippines.</i>
What did you call United States
at that time?
<i>It wasn't a free country then.</i>
<i>What was it? Michael?</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>They used to call it the melting pot.</i>
<i>Sometimes it seems like</i>
<i>the Tower of Babel.</i>
[Cheering]
<i>[Speaking French]</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Thomas Jefferson was the first one to worry.</i>
<i>"Immigrants,"he said,</i>
<i>"would turn this country...</i>
<i>"into a heterogeneous...</i>
<i>incoherent, distracted mass. "
<i>Lfhe'd been with us</i>
<i>all these months...</i>
<i>he could certainly have wondered...</i>
<i>"What happened to those white,</i>
<i>Anglo-Saxon Rrotestants...</i>
<i>who came off the Mayflower?"</i>
[Shouts Greeting]
Let's go.
Right spot!
Stallone is over here!
[Speaking Italian]
- God bless America and <i>viva I'Italia.</i>
- <i>God bless America.</i>
<i>[Malle]</i>
<i>Where do you come from exactly?</i>
What's the difference?
I'm here now.
- Green.
- Ah!
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Sophia Eduarte came from Cuba in 1980...</i>
<i>with the Mariel boat people.</i>
<i>First she had to get</i>
<i>her high school equivalency.</i>
<i>She follows a two-year program</i>
<i>to become a computer analyst.</i>
[Speaking Spanish]
So, whenever you're gonna do
any mathematical computations...
<i>No, no. Because you need</i>
<i>something in between to-</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Sophia married another Cuban immigrant.</i>
<i>They live in Little Havana,</i>
<i>the Cuban section of Miami.</i>
- Hello. How are you doing?
- <i>[Malle] Very good.</i>
- <i>This is your house.</i>
- Yes.
- <i>You told me you had a dog.</i>
- Yes. Wait.
<i>[Malle Narrating] She was not allowed</i>
<i>to bring her daughter from Cuba.</i>
- <i>[Sophia] Hellol</i>
- <i>But she went to great trouble to fly her dog.</i>
Give me your paw.
The other.
The other paw.
The other paw.
Good boy.
He speaks English.
- [Whining]
- He's 15 years old.
- <i>You think he likes America?</i>
- He loves it. He loves the food.
But he hates the mailman.
He hates the people of the garbage.
- When they come, he doesn't like it.
- [Growling]
He's a refugee.
But when his mother
becomes a U.S. Citizen...
then he will be a citizen too.
He travel in plane...
I didn't.
I came in a boat.
Was my dream
to come to United States.
The life in Cuba was so poor.
Was people with no ambitions...
no - no nothing.
Life in the United States,
working and studying -
you can have whatever you want.
<i>[Malle]</i>
<i>How long have you been in this house?</i>
Uh, for three years.
- <i>And it's your house.</i>
- Oh, yes. Thanks God.
<i>Was it difficult</i>
<i>for you to buy it?</i>
Yes. Well, difficult?
Not difficult, but, uh, hard...
because we have to save
a lot of money...
and make a lot of sacrifices,
you know -
not going anywhere,
just saving the money.
<i>Do you ever miss Cuba?</i>
Never. Never.
And I think I'll never be back.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Sophia doesn't have to go back.</i>
<i>Miami</i> is <i>Cuba.</i>
Hey!
<i>[Man] The world's tallest Cuban right here.</i>
<i>We're number one.</i>
Cubans are number one.
We're really the best
of all the minorities.
We're thankful to be here in
the United States, but most importantly...
United States should be thankful
of all the Cubans in Miami.
<i>[Man Speaking Spanish]</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating] The Cubans in Miami</i>
<i>have good reasons to celebrate.</i>
<i>In two decades,</i>
<i>they have made a sleepy resort...</i>
<i>into one of the fastest-growing cities</i>
<i>in America.</i>
<i>Miami is 65% Hispanic.</i>
<i>English is the second language here.</i>

<i>Little Saigon, Santa Ana, California.</i>

<i>Minh Engleson is the first American</i>
<i>police officer of Vietnamese descent.</i>
[Speaking Vietnamese]
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Almost 100,000 Vietnamese...</i>
<i>have resettled in Orange County...</i>
<i>and most of them do well.</i>
<i>Vietnamese take their food seriously.</i>
<i>They shop in their own supermarkets...</i>
<i>where the produce</i>
<i>is fresher and cheaper.</i>
Crab.
<i>In 1871, the riot in Los Angeles...</i>
<i>ended with the lynching</i>
<i>of 19 Chinese.</i>
<i>"The Yellow Reril,"they called it.</i>
<i>After years of violence,</i>
<i>the Oriental Exclusion Act...</i>
<i>shut off Asian immigration</i>
<i>for decades.</i>
<i>Times have changed.</i>
<i>Newcomer High School</i>
<i>in San Francisco.</i>
They come from 34 different countries
speaking 22 different languages and dialects.
Very motivated, I would say.
In my experience here in the past five years,
I've found that many youngsters...
are very success-oriented.
They realize that they
have to work hard, study hard.
They have to overcome a lot of barriers -
of course, discrimination and prejudice -
but I think they have the right attitude
to succeed in America.
<i>[Woman Speaking Chinese]</i>
<i>Seventy-two.</i>
<i>One of the factors will be-</i>
<i>[Chinese]</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating] In this classroom,</i>
<i>young immigrants from mainland China...</i>
<i>are learning mathematics and English</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>
<i>They are among 45,000 Chinese</i>
<i>who came to the U.S. Last year.</i>
Ten to the power of three,
plus five times 10 to the power of two...
six times 10 to the power of one,
and seven - four times one.
[Speaks Chinese]
Eight times 10 to the power of five.
[Chinese]
What time is it?
[Chinese]
You see times, okay?
Next page. Let's go.
<i>[Malle]</i>
<i>How long have you been in America?</i>
About four years.
- <i>Did you speak English before?</i>
- No, not at all.
I just knew, you know, alphabets,
you know, when I came here.
I learned a little bit
when I was in Korea...
um, in junior high...
but it was, like - like, you know,
in kindergarten in this country.
School is about seven, eight hours.
When I get home I study at least,
you know, four hours a day.
<i>So about 13 hours maybe?</i>
<i>[Malle] And you also help</i>
<i>your parents in the store, right?</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Yeah. I work on Sunday with my brothers...</i>
- Thank you.
- I want to get into the medicine as my career.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Jun-Yun Kim's grades are so good...</i>
I most like Columbia...
but I'm thinking of, you know,
little better ones...
like maybe Princeton
or something like that.
Either Stanford or Caltech...
because, uh, I have pretty much
a high S.A.T. Score.
<i>[Malle Narrating] Nick Ha and his family</i>
<i>escaped from Vietnam on a boat...</i>
<i>His painting hangs in the Capitol.</i>
<i>[Ha]</i>
<i>My teacher told me of a contest...</i>
<i>which would give me</i>
<i>some monetary award...</i>
<i>So I just did a painting</i>
<i>which, to my surprise, I won.</i>
I would like to be
an aerospace engineer...
and, um, use art as an escape...
from all that technical side of life
and so on.
<i>"There once was a boy named B.J.
Who had much plaque and decay.
Now he has no more teeth to decay."
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>And that was the winning limerick. Okay.</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>BJ. Singh Bindra is a Sikh from India.</i>
<i>[Malle]</i>
<i>So I understand you're a good student, huh?</i>
- I guess so.
- Yes, he's a very good student.
He had a wonderful report card.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>If you ever wanted to go further out...</i>
<i>and go look for intelligent life</i>
<i>somewhere in some other planet...</i>
you're not gonna tell 'em that you come from
Russia or you come from the United States...
or that you come from Costa Rica.
Because otherwise they won't
understand what you're saying.
And so you begin to realize
that you're not a citizen...
necessarily of one given country...
but you are really
a citizen of the world.
<i>[Malle Narrating] Franklin Chang-Díaz</i>
<i>is the first NASA astronaut...</i>
<i>He was a crew member</i>
<i>on the last shuttle mission...</i>
<i>before the accident.</i>
<i>[Chang-Díaz]</i>
<i>The way I felt when I first got into orbit...</i>
<i>was just undescribable,</i>
<i>just totally new.</i>
<i>[Chang-Díaz]</i>
<i>I was a little bit concerned...</i>
But just as I unstrapped
out of my seat...
<i>The entire six days</i>
<i>that we were up in orbit...</i>
<i>I just-I enjoyed</i>
<i>every minute of it.</i>
First of all, I'm an American citizen
and proud to be one.
Or at least everybody's family,
in this country, comes from somewhere else.
And I'm not any exception.
I have strong roots, uh,
in Costa Rica and in South America.
And some - uh, some roots,
uh, are still in China.
My paternal grandfather
was an immigrant...
to Costa Rica from China.
Sometime about 1905, 1910,
thereabouts.
<i>But Chang-Díaz trains every day</i>
<i>for up-and-coming missions.</i>
<i>This afternoon he practices</i>
<i>with this giant arm...</i>
<i>which moves payloads in space...</i>
<i>a precise and fastidious task.</i>
<i>[Chang-Díaz] I was one of those</i>
<i>very fortunate little kids...</i>
<i>I used to have my own simulator,</i>
<i>my own trainer in my backyard...</i>
which was, uh, nothing
but a cardboard box...
<i>And I would sit in there</i>
<i>with my friends and my cousins...</i>
<i>and we would practice</i>
<i>simulated ascents.</i>
<i>And we'd even go through</i>
<i>a simulated countdown and everything.</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>A gifted schoolboy in Costa Rica...</i>
<i>he came to the U.S. At 17...</i>
<i>and, through scholarships</i>
<i>and hard work...</i>
<i>made his way to a Rh.D.</i>
I became a U.S. Citizen
in, uh, 1977...
shortly after I graduated
from M.I.T.
And to me, it was a great honor
to be a U.S. Citizen...
because, in fact, this country
has given me everything that I have.
When I came here,
I didn't really have anything.
I didn't have the language. I didn't have
any money. Didn't have any education.
And everything that I have now,
I owe it to this society here.
To me, it is really nice to think...
that perhaps I will be flying many times
up into space again.
<i>And I look forward to someday</i>
<i>perhaps also work and live...</i>
<i>for an extended period of time</i>
<i>in a space station.</i>
- <i>[Malle Narrating] This is not out in space.</i>
Cold weather in Nebraska.
I get used to that now.
<i>[Malle]</i>
<i>But you were born in Saigon, weren't you?</i>
Yes. We never see snow before.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>He's the only Vietnamese around.</i>
<i>In Bridgeport</i>
<i>they call him Dr. Diem.</i>
Because of the degeneration
in her- of her tumor.
- Oh, please give me the copy of this.
- Okay. I will. Then you can call it down.
Can you sit up now, Nick?
Okay.
Does it hurt you in your ear?
- Sometimes.
- In both ears or left?
Let's look at the good ear first,
okay, Nick?
The left ear look good.
I still see a tube.
- Mm-hmm.
- He has a tube in his ear.
- Yeah.
- How long ago?
- It'll be two years in June.
- Mm-hmm.
<i>I'm going to look at</i>
<i>the right ear, okay?</i>
It won't hurt you, okay?
<i>[Malle] Was it a surprise</i>
<i>at the beginning when he first came?</i>
Well, I'd never worked
with a Vietnamese doctor before...
and it took an adjustment -
learning to understand him,
for one thing.
<i>[Malle]</i>
<i>Do you think he's going to stay here?</i>
Oh, yes. We hope so.
Okay.
Did you sleep well last night?
I had sleeping pill.
I sleep like a pig.
Good.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Rete Lapasoris is 93 years old.</i>
<i>Many farmers around here</i>
<i>came from Greece.</i>
<i>[Diem]</i>
<i>How do you say "hi"in Greek?</i>
- [Speaks Greek]
- <i>[Repeats Word]</i>
- <i>[Malle] You came through Ellis Island, right?</i>
- How's that?
<i>You came through Ellis Island.</i>
- <i>You came through New York.</i>
- Yeah.
It's the only place you could get in.
When you come to Nebraska,
nothing in Nebraska then.
<i>Cow roads.</i>
<i>I come 1907, 14 year old.</i>
I worked like a slave
for a dollar a day all my life.
<i>I don't do nothing now.</i>
<i>I stay in the hospital.</i>
Keep Diem busy.
<i>[Malle]</i>
<i>Are you a satisfied patient?</i>
You bet.
I joke him. We play cards with him.
We eat together.
We get along fine.
I never dreamed to be a pioneer.
I don't think so.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Seven years ago, Diem came to Omaha...</i>
<i>on a special program</i>
<i>for Vietnamese physicians.</i>
Uh, the Bridgeport Hospital here,
they, uh...
give me a loan.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Most of them left for gentler climates...</i>
<i>He wanted to repay his debt.</i>
I think that is a way I return something
to the people around here.
<i>[Malle Narrating] Family lunch</i>
<i>at the Oasis,</i> the <i>restaurant in town.</i>
<i>Diem seems completely accepted</i>
<i>by the community.</i>
<i>In fact, we are the only ones</i>
<i>who find his presence here surprising.</i>
- <i>[Diem] Oh. Okay.</i>
- She got her cast cut off at the same time.
- See you guys.
- Okay.
They said, "How do you get young nurses
to come to a small town?"
I said, <i>"I</i> have no idea,
'cause I won't come here."
And I did.
<i>And we met at the hospital.</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating] Diem's wife,Janet,</i>
<i>was a nurse at the hospital.</i>
- <i>She's from Illinois.</i>
- Always said I'd never marry a doctor.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Do you miss surgery at all?</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating] Diem was a surgeon</i>
<i>in the South Vietnamese army.</i>
The surgery I did before
is kind of like <i>M* A *S*H.</i>
You watch <i>M* A *S*H?</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Diem is doing well.</i>
- <i>He has his own clinic</i>
<i>and plays the stock market.</i>
- Hi. Go to the car, honey.
- [Lowing]
- Look at the cow. What does the cow say?
- Moo.
- [Cow Lowing]
Did you - Did you sell
some cow lately?
No. We make nothing, Diem.
We just work all year for nothing.
When is your dad supposed to -
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>The climate is tough, the economy is depressed.</i>
<i>Will Diem stay here forever?</i>
<i>He says yes.</i>
- You mean the coldest during the wintertime?
- <i>Yeah.</i>
Twenty, 30 below.
I watch TV.
From Diem, mostly, I think.
And his brother.
His brother's a better cook than he is.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>The Diems invite us to dinner.</i>
<i>Janet sort of cooks Vietnamese.</i>
This is pretty easy.
[Chuckling]
<i>Diem's parents are still in Saigon.</i>
One my brother,
he will come here very soon.
He's, uh, in Malaysia right now.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Two ofhis brothers are already in the U.S.</i>
I think he escaped
South Vietnam...
uh, sometime November 1985,
I think so.
<i>[Malle]</i>
<i>Was it a problem for you in the beginning-</i>
<i>language?</i>
No. Yeah.
I was working,
and a Greek lady came in.
And she didn't speak English
very well at all.
And I couldn't understand
either of'em -
the doctor or the patient.
Many time they tell me a joke...
So I usually ask them
what does it mean, you know.
Ajoke especially.
Ajoke in Nebraska.
But otherwise,
I think he's done real well.
<i>I understand him now</i>
<i>almost-almost all the time.</i>
<i>Downtown Houston,</i>
<i>Allen Rarkway Village...</i>
<i>is a federal development</i>
<i>going back to the '30s...</i>
<i>and traditionally reserved for blacks.</i>
<i>Now half of the residents</i>
<i>are Indo-Chinese.</i>
[Child Shouts]
They're driving us out.
We don't have nowhere to stay.
Um, the Vietnamese, at one point,
was taking over.
They could afford to come up with
the money we couldn't. Simple as that.
Our kids and our families
was being thrown out because of this.
<i>And even today,</i>
<i>the two communities don't mix.</i>
<i>Black kids play on one side</i>
<i>of the basketball court...</i>
<i>Vietnamese on the other.</i>
[Whistles]
Well, initially there was some tension
because you had two groups of people...
from two different worlds -
that was a culture shock.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Lenwood Johnson is head of the residents council.</i>
Uh, they dry their fish
out in the sun.
Um, blacks didn't like the odor
coming from the fish.
So there was a conflict there.
<i>[Woman] They had gardens. We wasn't</i>
<i>allowed to have gardens, you know?</i>
<i>They're drivin'fine cars,</i>
<i>and we can't even buy a used car.</i>
We walk everywhere
or we got to go catch the metro.
<i>[Johnson]</i>
<i>There's a cultural difference in here.</i>
<i>Americans can say something in one way,</i>
<i>it's offensive to Asian people.</i>
<i>They can say things another way</i>
<i>that we don't quite understand.</i>
<i>It has a different connotation.</i>
There was a whole lot of hostility.
There was a lot of, uh, fighting and -
<i>among the residents</i>
<i>and the Vietnamese...</i>
<i>because they pretty much did</i>
<i>what they wanted to.</i>
<i>It seems to be that the city...</i>
was conspiring
to demolish this place...

a group of people in here...
who did not have the political clout
to stop a demolition.
They wanted to redevelop this area

<i>The Vietnamese do not know their rights or laws...</i>

<i>"If you don't get out in two hours,</i>

<i>A lot of times the Vietnamese</i>

<i>They get out right then and there.</i>
<i>What they can carry on their backs.</i>
<i>They get scared, and they leave.</i>

Well, I think that they're trying

<i>[Malle]</i>
<i>Are they succeeding?</i>
Well, not all of us.

<i>Outside pressure has forced residents to unite.</i>
<i>[Johnson] It's a little difficult,</i>
<i>with approximately five different languages...</i>

instead of fighting each other.
As long as it's here,

- Egypt.
- <i>[Malle] Egypt?</i>
- Mm-hmm.
- <i>Do you like it here?</i>
Yeah.
- <i>Would you like to go back to Egypt?</i>
- No.
- [Girls Laughing]
- It stinks!
There are some parts
that have bad sewage areas.
- <i>You like it better in Orange County, right?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>What are you going to do</i>

Go to the college.
[Chattering]
<i>[Malle Narrating] They often do very well</i>
<i>as doctors, scientists, teachers, engineers.</i>
<i>But they're self-conscious</i>
<i>about their image.</i>
The assumption, if you're an Arab...
is that you, uh, were born in a tent...
that you rode camels as a young man,
that you're dirty, that you're ignorant.
<i>[Malle Narrating] TheJadats are successful</i>
<i>graphics designers in Washington, D. C...</i>
<i>yet they feel prejudice.</i>
It makes us a bit nervous
that things that happened over there...
that have really nothing to do with us
as individuals here...
uh, affect the way
that Americans perceive Arabs...
and Americans, in general,
perceive Arabs...
in a very stereotyped way.
My parents are both Palestinian...
and they came to Lebanon in '48...
when a lot of Palestinians left
and went to Lebanon.
The amount of terrorism that's going on
in that part of the world now...
and all the media attention to it...
just brings home to Americans...
the false illusion
that all Arabs are terrorists.
I wish we could lead our lives
like everybody else does...
but I think, uh, fate has it...
that we are who we are...
and in this point in history,
things are bad.
We try to blend in, as I'm sure
most American immigrants have done...
over the years -
try to become a part
of American society...
and in a way deny their roots.

Well, for some thing it's better,

<i>What is it that you don't like here?</i>
The freedom without direction.

[Chuckling]
- <i>What do you do for a living?</i>
- Oh, I'm a beautician.
- <i>A what?</i>
- Beautician.
- <i>Which means what?</i>
- I just do hairstyling and beauty work.
It's just against of my-
I mean, voluntary work here.
<i>Where do you do that?</i>
<i>Do you have a store-</i>
I work with a company.
I work with Elizabeth Arden.
<i>And, uh, where did you start that?</i>
<i>In Rakistan?</i>
No, I started here.
I was a schoolteacher in Pakistan.
- <i>And a beautician in America.</i>
- Right.
America is so beautiful,
it attracted me to go into that line.
[Laughing]
Is that the process of becoming American
is continual...
and it's a process
much more revolutionary...
Because it is not the evolution of the state,
but the evolution of the individual...
that is emphasized in that concept.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Derek Walcott is a poet and playwright...</i>
<i>from St. Lucia in the West Indies.</i>
The idea of making
every taste the same...
uh, can lead to
a kind of dictatorship...
of mediocrity, of poor taste.
And if you find yourself
in that ambience...
um, without fighting...
um, in my writing - especially if you're
doing performance writing -
saying, "Well, you can't say that because,
I mean, that's a little complicated."
But in terms of a concept of something,
what will go down...
it happens to every person
who comes here.
Whether it is
in the person's conduct...
clothes, you know, style...
it is a threat.
Democracy- an aggressive democracy-
It says, "Be equal," right?
<i>"You've gotta be equal," right?
And that's a responsibility.
You have to be as equal as the next guy.
You know, well,
I don't always want to be equal.
I want to feel superior or inferior sometimes.
My choice, you know.
<i>[Malle Narrating] Certainly American</i>
<i>mass culture is a powerful equalizer.</i>
<i>Unlike Derek Walcott, most immigrants</i>
<i>embrace its values with enthusiasm.</i>
It's much better than what I used to know.

- Yeah, I'm fixing it. I bought an old house, and -

<i>How did he manage?</i>
I, uh, first started on washing dishes...

Then I work in financial fields.
And now I'm working in electronics.
<i>[Malle]</i>
<i>Tell me. How did Texas Instruments find you?</i>
They came and recruited me

I was attending technical school.
I mean, they had people
constantly coming from different companies.
<i>Because you had special skills or-</i>
No. I think I was doing good at that time.
I mean, uh -And, uh, they went and talked to
the headmaster of the school and, uh...
I think he recommended me very well.
I try to keep up with it.
I go to school, attend seminars and -

- Jamie, don't expect any from me.
- [Laughs]
<i>[Ali] No matter how much I like America,</i>

You always miss something -
your culture, the way you were brought up -
no matter what.
- <i>[Gazan] Nowhere is like home.</i>
- <i>[Ali] Yes.</i>
<i>Things are different. Especially on holidays.</i>
<i>You have nowhere to go.</i>
You go to the restaurant
and come back home. That's it.
And everybody comes out and -
Just you have a blast.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>But Meserite doesn't care to live in the past.</i>
<i>[Gazan]</i>
<i>When I came here, I decided just to forget.</i>
I said,
<i>"Hey, this is where I'm gonna stay...
so I have to do it
the way people do it here."
For me just to catch up
and adapt into the system...
It's not a question of rejected.
It's, uh, a question of saying...
<i>"Hey. That's what I left,
and I shouldn't bring it here.
It has to stay back there."
<i>For me, it is a parental responsibility...</i>

When I first arrived in this country,
I didn't know what to do exactly...
because all of my career
was in the army, you see.
And finally-
[Clears Throat]
I get into - in the, uh, um -
Colt industry.
Uh, the factory who make the guns, see?
Because, uh, I was military...
so I should be -
be very familiar with the gun.
And, uh, I get into this factory...
and I make, uh, the M16, M15...
- <i>Not Kim.</i>
- At first I wasn't well-adapted to the school...

and every time I go to school
I start crying.
Now, let's see -
About 11 - It's 11 years now.
So, um...
I sometimes eat Laotian food...
but now I'm used to it, so I tend to eat
American food more than Laotian food.
- <i>[Malle] What kind of food do you like?</i>
- Pizza, hamburgers - [Chuckles]
Um, anything.
You know, anything that's not smelly,
like Laotian food.
Sometimes Laotian food are really smelly type.

First of all, we want to preserve

Secondly, we want to, uh, help...

because if the children
do not understand...
why their parents
expected of them certain, uh, behavior...
they would be frustrated and resent it.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>

<i>Many of these children</i>

<i>Here, for Nila Ratel and her family...</i>

- <i>[Malle] This is the room where you-</i>
- Spend most of our time.
<i>No. Some of it did, some of it not.</i>
Like this copper plaque.
It came from Rhodesia.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>The kitchen is American...</i>

<i>[Mr. Ratel]</i>
<i>This is our temple. Small temple.</i>
<i>And we worship twice a day.</i>

<i>And whenever we get an opportunity</i>

<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Now, about the worldly things.</i>
This was my first hotel. Yes, sir.
1974 on July 4.
<i>Everything was doing ourselves,</i>

<i>From the maid work, managing,</i>

Spending 16 hours a day on it.
Yeah. Cleaning up, doing the room.

Well, I'd like to start my own business.
<i>[Malle]</i>
<i>Like what?</i>
Right now I'm going to
Archbishop Mitty High School...
and in the future
I want to go to Stanford University.
I expect him to look after me.
And I'm sure he will look after-
the way you mold him, you know...
and the way you bring him up -
that is what makes a difference.
See, American - the boys will leave
when they are 20, 21...
and when the parents get old,
what they will do?
They will put them in the old people homes
or something like that.
In our culture, the people
will stay together, you know...
and I'm sure he will look after us,
you know, in olden days as well.
<i>[Malle] Would you consider getting married</i>
<i>with somebody who is not Indian origin?</i>
Probably not.
Definitely not.
'Cause I was brought up -
I think I'm more Indian than American.
Put it that way.
<i>What we are trying to do-</i>
<i>We are very fortunate that we have two culture...</i>
and we can choose the best of it.
You know, certain things are good in Indian.
Certain things are good in American.
And we try to take the best out of both
so we can be better off than anybody else.
<i>That is how I look at it.</i>
I think the -
the fact that one can be so enormously
comfortable, at least...
in this country, um,
for any reason at all...
is part of its mystique.
There's a built-in, almost Old-Testament-ish
kind of- of statement in this democracy...
that says hard struggle will be rewarded.
And it will not be rewarded spiritually.
It will be rewarded financially.
[Chattering]
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>This union shop in New York City is an exception.</i>
<i>All over the country,</i>
<i>hundreds of sweatshops employ immigrants...</i>
<i>often way under the minimum wage.</i>
<i>Their hard work and low pay</i>
<i>keep the American garment industry competitive.</i>
<i>[Man] It is a myth</i>
<i>that immigrants built the United States.</i>
When immigration levels were too high...
the result was social conflict
and the destruction of dreams.
A third of the immigrants
of the early part of this century went back.
They didn't fulfill the dream.
Their dreams somehow were destroyed.
There was a time in -
when immigration was high...
when the living standards
for American workers were collapsing...
where the industrialists
had total power, total say...
and could force the workers to put up
with any working conditions they wanted...
because they could always turn abroad
for cheap foreign labor.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>In Washington, Roger Conner is director of FAI R:</i>
<i>Federation for American Immigration Reform.</i>
<i>"... deprived of these immigrants,
the economy will collapse."
The problem is I can't get hired
on that construction job...
because the employer, uh, knows that
he doesn't intend to pay what the prevailing wage is.
<i>[Malle Narrating] In Texas, Hispanic-Americans</i>
<i>complain that illegal immigrants from Mexico...</i>
<i>are taking more and more</i>
<i>of the construction jobs.</i>
...employee of five dollars an hour,
for example.
So the contractor knows that as long as
he employs an undocumented worker up there...
he can cheat him out of his money.
<i>[Conner]</i>
<i>We're not going to have unlimited immigration.</i>
<i>The only question is...</i>
<i>when are we going to stop it</i>
<i>and by what means?</i>
<i>Are we gonna wait</i>
<i>until the American people are so angry...</i>
<i>so threatened, so frightened...</i>
<i>that they will support putting a military-</i>
<i>an armed military-on the border?</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Tijuana, the U.S. Border, 5:00 in the afternoon.</i>

<i>of Mexico, central Mexico:</i>
<i>Michoacán,Jalisco, Oaxaca.</i>
<i>Mexico right now is in a very deep crisis -
<i>economic crisis.</i>
<i>There are no jobs for every Mexicans.</i>

<i>That's the dichotomy that has to be</i>

<i>And I thought that, uh, I couldn't just</i>
<i>sit at home in retirement...</i>
<i>if I could just give them, uh, a hand</i>
<i>a little bit here or there...</i>
and, uh, let them know that somebody cares...
that, uh, we want to be their friend, that
we appreciate what they do and their being here.
<i>They are the one who provide the labor...</i>
<i>to maintain</i>
<i>all these fabulous-looking gardens and-</i>
<i>a development for millionaires</i>
<i>just down the hill.</i>
[Spanish]
No, these children have no access to school.
Uh, they have no access to health care...
uh, to any of the facilities
that we take for granted.
- <i>[Martinez Speaking Spanish]</i>
- [Spanish]
[Spanish]
<i>This woman is wonderful.</i>
<i>She takes in anyone who has no place to stay.</i>
And a few weeks ago, there were
about 20 people living here with her.
And she shares whatever little food
she gets or we can get for her.
She won't let anybody go hungry.
Isn't that beautiful?

<i>[Malle Narrating] Rablo Ortega was the head</i>
<i>engineer of a sugar plant in El Salvador.</i>
<i>One night in June, 1983...</i>
<i>his life took a turn.</i>
<i>[Man Translating]</i>
<i>The, uh, Salvadorean army visited their home...</i>
<i>and, uh, beat him...</i>
<i>The entire family of six children</i>
<i>and the wife were beaten.</i>
<i>The eldest daughter was raped.</i>
<i>And he was left, uh, paralyzed.</i>
<i>That is what began</i>
<i>the story that ended up with them...</i>
finally, after a great deal of trouble,
getting to the United States.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>His wife and children came here on tourist visas...</i>
<i>but Rablo himselfhad to cross</i>
<i>the Rio Grande at night on his wheelchair...</i>
<i>supported by inner tubes.</i>
<i>They ended up in Long Island, New York.</i>
<i>A refugee organization</i>
<i>found them camping in Westbury Rark.</i>
<i>With the help of the Catholic Church,</i>
<i>they moved recently into this house.</i>
<i>It seems like a happy ending,</i>
<i>but Immigration found them.</i>
The Immigration judge
has informed me...
that he's going to deny, uh,
political asylum for this family.
The reasons why he's going to deny,
I don't know.
I can't conceive of a good one.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Joseph Fazar is Rablo's lawyer.</i>
We'll have to wait and see what
the specific terms of the decision are...
before we take out our appeal.
But the important thing in this is that,
without an office like mine...
a voluntary agency
that doesn't charge money...
this family would be going to
El Salvador shortly.
<i>[Chattering On TV]</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating] Rablo's kids have</i>
<i>adjusted quickly to the American lifestyle.</i>
<i>Antonio, the eldest son,</i>
<i>distributes newspapers to help the family.</i>
- <i>He likes the neighbors.</i>
- Very good with us. Sometimes.
<i>[Malle Narrating] He doesn't want to go back to</i>
<i>El Salvador, where his arm was broken by a soldier.</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Rablo's wife works all day cleaning houses.</i>
<i>Concocted a device to connect</i>
<i>the brake and gas pedals...</i>
<i>to a special handle under the wheel.</i>
[Spanish]
<i>[Fazar]</i>
<i>He's, uh, had the van four days.</i>
<i>He's in the process of trying to get himself work</i>
<i>driving people and things around.</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>I hope for Rablo that he gets political asylum.</i>
<i>But soon one-fifth of the population</i>
<i>of El Salvador will be in this country...</i>
<i>running away from violence and famine.</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>This is the formal living room.</i>
This is a new house for us really.
<i>[Malle Narrating] We are visiting the Miami</i>
<i>house of General Somoza and his family.</i>
The house consists of, actually,
three sitting areas.
You have the conversation pit,
which is down here.
<i>The painting above was done</i>
<i>by a famous South American painter...</i>
<i>in-in Nicaragua of my mother</i>
<i>in her younger years, of course.</i>
<i>We were very happy back home, with the-</i>
<i>with a lot of exceptions.</i>
<i>I mean, happiness.</i>
<i>What is happiness? Right?</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating] General Somoza was</i>
<i>commander of the National Guard in Nicaragua.</i>
<i>His brother Anastasio ruled the country.</i>
And this is our sitting room...
where most of the time our guests,
when they come here...
<i>sit and enjoy our conversation</i>
<i>with my father.</i>
Let me show you, uh, our dining room.
Also a conversation piece
because of its size.
Normally in, uh, regular American homes...
you don't find dining rooms
that sit 24 people at once.
And being that we're a large family
and have a few friends -
<i>[Malle Narrating] The Somoza dictatorship</i>
<i>went unchallenged for 40 years...</i>
<i>until they were forced into exile</i>
<i>by the Sandinista revolution.</i>
<i>They took their movables with them.</i>
This dining room is - Most of the, um,
decoration you find here...
is a mixture of Europeans
and South Americans.
<i>Uh, French, Italian.</i>
These two pieces should be
of great interest to you.
My mother purchased them in Europe
many years ago.
<i>They are French Sèvres,</i>
<i>and they are signed.</i>
<i>And the interesting thing is that you can</i>
<i>move them around and show a different side.</i>
It has actually two faces, which -
Anytime you'd like to
switch them around, you can.
And through this door I can show you
our kitchen and our breakfast room.
This is - [Chuckles]
That's my father, General Somoza.
This is a very typical American kitchen...
where the family normally surrounds itself,
you know.
You cook and you eat here.
- By the way, this is my mother.
- <i>[Malle] Hello.</i>
<i>Uh, my mother does most of the cooking,</i>
<i>especially for my father, who's on a special diet.</i>
<i>Uh, we have become very, uh,</i>
<i>simple in our life...</i>
<i>unless we have friends over, then we have to</i>
<i>move over to our- to our bigger dining room.</i>
- [Spanish]
- <i>[Malle Narrating] Carlos, Luis and Julio Somoza...</i>
<i>are the co-owners of this restaurant</i>
<i>in a shopping mall in South Miami.</i>
<i>They serve exquisite Nicaraguan cuisine.</i>
The idea came up. We've always liked, uh,
quality and - and service.
And there's also a nostalgia part to it.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Like good American entrepreneurs...</i>
<i>they plan to make</i>
<i>Los Ranchos into a chain.</i>
<i>Meanwhile, the general and his wife</i>
<i>live a peaceful life at home.</i>
<i>I asked the general</i>
<i>ifhe supports actively the contras.</i>
- Oh, no.
- <i>He doesn't.</i>
<i>The contras are not supposed to</i>
<i>have anything to do with the Somozas.</i>
[Spanish]
[Spanish]
<i>[Malle Narrating] Mrs. Somoza keeps herself</i>
<i>busy with the sewing and the cooking.</i>
<i>The general, when he doesn't watch</i>
<i>the Mexican soaps on channel 23...</i>
<i>tends the roses ofhis garden.</i>
[Spanish]
<i>[Man Translating]</i>
<i>He loves plants, and he takes good care of them.</i>
<i>[Man] When we talk to him,</i>
<i>and when we're in front ofhim...</i>
we do act differently
than when we are alone...
because there is that tremendous respect.
<i>[Man #2] We were aware that,</i>
<i>you know, he is our father...</i>
<i>but he had this awesome power...</i>
<i>that he could decide</i>
<i>on somebody's life or death.</i>
<i>For us, he is General Somoza.</i>
And General Somoza, in Nicaragua,
was a powerful man.
And now my children do not know
how to handle the formal.
<i>And, to my father,</i>
<i>that was originally a shock...</i>
<i>and he thought it was</i>
<i>very disrespectful.</i>
<i>[Malle] What do you think</i>
<i>you're going to do when you're grown up?</i>
- Maybe, uh, like, something that has to do with -
- [Somoza Whispers In Spanish]
Drawing or, like, architecture.
I've been told by some people you should,
you know, tell your children everything you can.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Dealing with the family past is difficult for Luis.</i>
<i>He's reluctant to share it with his children.</i>
...on their own, really.
<i>I'm not going to justify anything.</i>
<i>I'm not going to-</i>
<i>He will have to wait for that. I'm not ready for it.</i>
<i>I'm the one who's not ready for it.</i>
[Boy]
Pull! Run, run, run!
- This one is a mess.
- <i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Is it really possible to abolish the past?</i>
<i>[Malle] How do you feel about</i>
<i>this real change in lifestyle from what-</i>
<i>what was your life in, uh, Nicaragua?</i>
<i>[Boy]</i>
<i>Nicaragua?</i>
- Run, run. Hurry. Uh, I -
- <i>[Boy] Run, run, run, run. Rulll</i>
I don't know. I - I -
To me, this is really more...
a natural life than -
than what we had before.
I guess you can say I'm free.
Now I really think I - Now that -
Now that you ask me that question,
I think I'm free. I'm really happy.
<i>[Malle Narrating] Rerhaps the dictator's nephew</i>
<i>is becoming just another suburban American.</i>
<i>I'll drink to that.</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>Our last water hole was the Odessa...</i>
<i>Here, Russian Jews never stop celebrating</i>
<i>being in America.</i>
[Laughing, Chattering]
I like the people.
I like the -
I don't know, but I love the United States.
I love the America.
It is my lovely country.
I love music.
I love freedom.
I love jazz,
so I came to this country.
Oh, yes. America - it is my dream.
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>DianeJones, the singer of the band...</i>
<i>is from Trenton, New Jersey.</i>
<i>How shall I call it?</i>
<i>Assimilation in reverse?</i>
<i>This has to be the last paradox</i>
<i>of my American voyage.</i>
<i>[Malle Narrating]</i>
<i>To all those I have pursued with my camera...</i>
<i>whether they ended up</i>
<i>on the screen or not...</i>
<i>I want to express my gratitude</i>
<i>and my admiration.</i>
